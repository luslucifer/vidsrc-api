2
00:00:42.637 --> 00:00:43.741
Still feeling dizzy?

3
00:00:45.985 --> 00:00:46.813
Not really.

4
00:00:49.402 --> 00:00:50.438
We're almost there.

5
00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:07.558
Ready.

6
00:01:20.468 --> 00:01:21.952
How long have we lived here?

7
00:01:23.747 --> 00:01:24.782
Going on ten years.

8
00:01:26.267 --> 00:01:27.993
C'mon, honey, your
room's this way.


9
00:01:33.895 --> 00:01:36.380
Let's get some light in here.

10
00:01:44.492 --> 00:01:46.183
It's so clean.

11
00:01:48.668 --> 00:01:49.980
Are you hungry?

12
00:01:51.602 --> 00:01:54.433
Actually just kinda tired.

13
00:01:54.502 --> 00:01:56.124
yeah of course.

14
00:01:56.193 --> 00:02:00.232
We can do all this later, okay?

15
00:02:34.369 --> 00:02:35.508
That's exactly
the wrong thing to do.


16
00:02:35.577 --> 00:02:37.200
And your suggestion?

17
00:02:37.269 --> 00:02:38.511
My suggestion?
We keep her GPA up,


18
00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:39.788
we get her used to doing
the things she's used to do,


19
00:02:39.857 --> 00:02:41.514
and we get her back to normal.

20
00:02:41.583 --> 00:02:43.654
She don't want them
hearing through someone else!


21
00:02:43.723 --> 00:02:45.553
And risk losing
the scholarship?


22
00:02:45.622 --> 00:02:46.519
That would be a disaster.

23
00:02:46.588 --> 00:02:47.969
The disaster already happened.

24
00:02:48.038 --> 00:02:49.074
This gets her in front of it.

25
00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:52.318
Are you gonna pay the
tuition once she loses it?


26
00:02:52.387 --> 00:02:53.388
That's not fair.

27
00:02:54.838 --> 00:02:55.873
Hey.

28
00:02:55.942 --> 00:02:56.840
Hi.

29
00:03:02.742 --> 00:03:04.192
Thanks for
bringing the food.


30
00:03:04.261 --> 00:03:05.090
Of course.

31
00:03:06.677 --> 00:03:08.748
So, how long have you
two been divorced?


32
00:03:10.543 --> 00:03:12.097
- About four...
- Four years.


33
00:03:14.064 --> 00:03:17.309
Honey, we have a lot of
time to go over all this.


34
00:03:21.036 --> 00:03:23.038
It's been a week since
the accident.


35
00:03:24.212 --> 00:03:25.972
I know you're overwhelmed.

36
00:03:27.215 --> 00:03:28.492
There's a lot to process.

37
00:03:29.873 --> 00:03:32.393
It's okay, I was just asking.

38
00:03:33.601 --> 00:03:34.360
We're here for you.

39
00:03:34.429 --> 00:03:35.292
We love you.

40
00:04:18.818 --> 00:04:19.647
Was that Ethan?

41
00:04:19.716 --> 00:04:21.718
Yeah. He brought your phone.

42
00:04:21.787 --> 00:04:24.099
He doesn't seem my type.

43
00:04:24.169 --> 00:04:26.516
There are about a hundred
girls in your school who would


44
00:04:26.585 --> 00:04:30.382
be thrilled to hear
you say that.


45
00:04:30.451 --> 00:04:32.901
This is toast, honey.
Won't even turn on.


46
00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:36.111
What do you say we go get
you a new phone?


47
00:04:43.153 --> 00:04:44.775
That's your school...

48
00:04:55.338 --> 00:04:57.063
Look straight head of me,
please,


49
00:04:59.721 --> 00:05:01.413
You still have the ringing?

50
00:05:01.482 --> 00:05:02.448
Yeah, sometimes.

51
00:05:03.691 --> 00:05:06.659
Well, physically,
you're doing great.


52
00:05:06.728 --> 00:05:09.490
That being said, I'm sure
the memory loss


53
00:05:09.559 --> 00:05:11.423
has to be very
disconcerting for you.


54
00:05:11.492 --> 00:05:13.597
When will it come back?

55
00:05:13.666 --> 00:05:15.220
Wish I could tell you
with certainty


56
00:05:15.289 --> 00:05:17.463
how long we're looking at

57
00:05:17.532 --> 00:05:19.603
and to what what extent it
will come back.


58
00:05:21.087 --> 00:05:22.606
So when you say 'to
what extent'.


59
00:05:22.675 --> 00:05:24.470
I'm not trying to
be an alarmist.


60
00:05:24.539 --> 00:05:25.609
Could this be permanent?

61
00:05:25.678 --> 00:05:26.921
I highly doubt it,

62
00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:29.337
but I can't
completely rule it out.


63
00:05:48.149 --> 00:05:49.219
This mine?

64
00:05:49.288 --> 00:05:50.427
Hm-hmm.

65
00:05:50.496 --> 00:05:51.773
Am I a good driver?

66
00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:53.568
It's debatable.

67
00:06:03.302 --> 00:06:04.372
You remember the code?

68
00:06:06.512 --> 00:06:08.411
Yeah, we literally
just set it up.


69
00:06:09.446 --> 00:06:10.792
Okay.

70
00:06:16.557 --> 00:06:18.731
I'm gonna go for break
right after dinner.


71
00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:19.594
If that's okay.

72
00:06:22.045 --> 00:06:23.564
Not too far, okay?

73
00:06:23.633 --> 00:06:25.082
And wear a helmet.

74
00:06:25.151 --> 00:06:26.187
Maybe I shouldn't.

75
00:06:26.256 --> 00:06:28.016
Then if I get knocked on
my head again,


76
00:06:28.085 --> 00:06:29.363
everything will come back.

77
00:08:28.654 --> 00:08:30.587
Hey, you got visitors.

78
00:08:31.243 --> 00:08:32.347
Lexi and Heather.

79
00:08:32.417 --> 00:08:33.970
You remember me telling
you about them?


80
00:08:34.039 --> 00:08:35.385
- Hi.
- Hey.


81
00:08:35.454 --> 00:08:36.524
They were wondering
if you felt up


82
00:08:36.593 --> 00:08:37.974
to hanging out tomorrow.

83
00:08:38.043 --> 00:08:39.113
Yeah, we have practice

84
00:08:39.182 --> 00:08:40.873
and we thought we'd
go to the lake.


85
00:08:41.840 --> 00:08:43.704
Honey, no pressure.

86
00:08:43.773 --> 00:08:45.430
That might be good, you know?

87
00:08:49.054 --> 00:08:50.331
So, which one of you is Lexi

88
00:08:50.400 --> 00:08:51.746
and which one is Heather?

89
00:08:51.815 --> 00:08:53.403
I'm Lexi.

90
00:08:53.472 --> 00:08:55.819
That's my hoodie you're
wearing by the way.


91
00:08:55.888 --> 00:08:57.476
You took it the last
time we hung out.


92
00:08:58.926 --> 00:09:00.962
Lexi's always
stealing our clothes.


93
00:09:01.031 --> 00:09:02.654
I'm Heather.

94
00:09:02.723 --> 00:09:04.897
Sorry I don't
remember you guys.


95
00:09:04.966 --> 00:09:05.795
It's okay.

96
00:09:07.866 --> 00:09:09.143
Do you wanna come with us?

97
00:09:10.178 --> 00:09:11.697
Yeah, honey.

98
00:09:11.766 --> 00:09:13.354
It'd probably be a good.

99
00:09:24.952 --> 00:09:27.506
So, how's Lexi's and
Heather's experiment going?


100
00:09:29.888 --> 00:09:31.268
You don't really know me,
do you?


101
00:09:32.304 --> 00:09:35.997
Ethan. I saw pictures.

102
00:09:38.310 --> 00:09:39.656
You remember any of this?

103
00:09:43.971 --> 00:09:46.076
Heard you were at the hospital

104
00:09:46.145 --> 00:09:48.700
but they wouldn't
let you see me.


105
00:09:48.769 --> 00:09:51.461
Yeah, yeah you were
really confused, Ali.


106
00:09:52.704 --> 00:09:54.499
I think everyone was
nervous to throw too much


107
00:09:54.568 --> 00:09:57.053
at you at once. That's all.

108
00:09:57.122 --> 00:09:59.573
They said another car
ran a stop sign.


109
00:10:02.023 --> 00:10:02.852
Is everyone okay?

110
00:10:05.199 --> 00:10:07.235
Yeah... yeah they're
good as far as I know.


111
00:10:09.168 --> 00:10:10.584
They're probably relieved,

112
00:10:10.653 --> 00:10:12.724
we're not pressing charges
or suing them or anything.


113
00:10:18.833 --> 00:10:22.630
Could you tell Lexi
and Heather I had to go?


114
00:10:22.699 --> 00:10:24.770
Yeah, yeah, you want me to
give you a ride back home?


115
00:10:26.565 --> 00:10:28.360
Listen, I get it. I get
it if you don't.


116
00:10:28.429 --> 00:10:30.535
Yeah, I kind of
just wanna walk.


117
00:10:30.604 --> 00:10:32.847
It's about two miles
back to your place, Al.


118
00:10:34.228 --> 00:10:35.056
I'll be okay.

119
00:10:35.988 --> 00:10:36.817
Okay.

120
00:11:08.055 --> 00:11:11.645
Ali, you okay?

121
00:11:12.715 --> 00:11:13.543
Hey.

122
00:11:16.822 --> 00:11:17.996
I'm not sure.

123
00:11:18.065 --> 00:11:20.585
Actually I think I got
my directions mixed up


124
00:11:20.654 --> 00:11:22.103
coming from the soccer field.

125
00:11:22.172 --> 00:11:23.588
Where you trying to go?

126
00:11:24.658 --> 00:11:26.211
Do we know each other?

127
00:11:26.280 --> 00:11:27.557
So it is true?

128
00:11:28.765 --> 00:11:29.732
What? What's true?

129
00:11:31.423 --> 00:11:32.838
There's a rumor...

130
00:11:35.116 --> 00:11:36.877
I'm Cameron...

131
00:11:36.946 --> 00:11:41.053
And yeah, we sort of
know each other...


132
00:11:42.365 --> 00:11:45.161
My phone died. Do you
know where I live?


133
00:11:45.230 --> 00:11:48.095
Yeah, you're kind of heading
in the wrong direction.


134
00:11:48.164 --> 00:11:49.544
Oh.

135
00:11:49.614 --> 00:11:51.823
Come on, I'll show you.

136
00:11:55.550 --> 00:11:59.175
So um... what's it like?

137
00:12:01.453 --> 00:12:05.043
If you don't mind
talking about it.


138
00:12:05.112 --> 00:12:06.734
Well you can clearly
walk and talk


139
00:12:06.803 --> 00:12:09.150
so you've got that
going for you.


140
00:12:09.219 --> 00:12:13.189
Yeah. And I can also
chew gum at the same time.


141
00:12:14.500 --> 00:12:15.501
Amazing, right?

142
00:12:15.570 --> 00:12:17.987
Okay. Okay.. Sense of humor.

143
00:12:18.056 --> 00:12:19.057
Another plus.

144
00:12:21.507 --> 00:12:22.716
We're still trying
to figure out


145
00:12:22.785 --> 00:12:23.751
what I know and don't know.

146
00:12:23.820 --> 00:12:27.134
But I can add, subtract,
do calculus,


147
00:12:27.203 --> 00:12:31.207
tie my shoes... and
execute pretty


148
00:12:31.276 --> 00:12:33.623
much any normal task

149
00:12:33.692 --> 00:12:38.421
with efficiency and even style.

150
00:12:39.422 --> 00:12:40.250
Nice.

151
00:12:42.114 --> 00:12:44.116
I seem to know a lot of things

152
00:12:44.185 --> 00:12:48.673
but I'm extremely limited in
the knowledge of one thing.


153
00:12:50.709 --> 00:12:54.126
But that one thing is sort
of the main thing, isn't it?


154
00:12:54.195 --> 00:12:57.405
Yeah. Hmm hm. Me.

155
00:13:03.101 --> 00:13:04.274
So, you in a band?

156
00:13:05.379 --> 00:13:09.107
No. Just practicing. I
do my own stuff.


157
00:13:13.387 --> 00:13:16.942
You know I read about these
Buddhist monks who believe


158
00:13:17.011 --> 00:13:20.877
in a sort of dynamic emptiness.

159
00:13:20.946 --> 00:13:23.086
No past. No future. Only now.

160
00:13:24.847 --> 00:13:27.021
They'd probably love
to have what you have.


161
00:13:29.886 --> 00:13:30.784
They can have it.

162
00:13:41.864 --> 00:13:42.934
Hey, Ali, are you okay?

163
00:13:44.314 --> 00:13:46.592
We talked to Ethan and he
said you just walked away.


164
00:13:46.661 --> 00:13:49.216
Yeah, come on. We'll
take you home, okay.


165
00:13:50.665 --> 00:13:51.701
Thanks for helping.

166
00:13:54.566 --> 00:13:56.706
You really
should have waited for us.


167
00:13:56.775 --> 00:13:58.087
And that kid
you were with,


168
00:13:58.156 --> 00:14:01.815
Cameron Reed, he's not someone
you should be talking to.


169
00:14:01.884 --> 00:14:03.299
He seemed nice to me.

170
00:14:03.368 --> 00:14:06.233
Just let us
help you get back to normal.


171
00:14:06.302 --> 00:14:07.786
We don't want you snapping
out of this and then realize


172
00:14:07.855 --> 00:14:09.788
you've damaged your rep
beyond repair.


173
00:14:10.927 --> 00:14:12.584
Cameron's sort of a loner.

174
00:14:12.653 --> 00:14:14.517
He got arrested over
the summer...


175
00:14:14.586 --> 00:14:15.863
Well that's a rumor.

176
00:14:15.932 --> 00:14:17.347
He's doing court
ordered community


177
00:14:17.416 --> 00:14:19.039
service at the park
because he got


178
00:14:19.108 --> 00:14:20.557
caught tagging at the Grove...

179
00:14:20.626 --> 00:14:22.283
Again, a rumor.

180
00:14:22.352 --> 00:14:23.940
Yeah, but climbing
the towers at the Grove


181
00:14:24.009 --> 00:14:27.668
is kind of announcing you
have some insanity streak.


182
00:14:27.737 --> 00:14:28.738
He's trouble, Ali.

183
00:14:29.981 --> 00:14:31.016
Next thing you know,
you'll be bumping


184
00:14:31.085 --> 00:14:32.742
shoulders in the back
of a cop car.


185
00:14:32.811 --> 00:14:34.882
Just let us take care of you,
Ali.


186
00:14:36.677 --> 00:14:38.196
And please don't tell
your mom we got separated.


187
00:14:38.265 --> 00:14:42.959
She hears that, she definitely
will not let us tutor you.


188
00:14:47.343 --> 00:14:48.171
Yeah.

189
00:14:50.242 --> 00:14:51.519
How'd it go?

190
00:14:51.588 --> 00:14:53.556
Ethan was there.

191
00:14:53.625 --> 00:14:54.695
And?

192
00:14:55.592 --> 00:14:57.146
I don't know.

193
00:14:57.215 --> 00:14:59.286
When I asked him about the
other people in the accident,


194
00:14:59.355 --> 00:15:02.530
he said they're probably
happy we're not suing them.


195
00:15:04.360 --> 00:15:06.500
Thought that was an odd
thing to say.


196
00:15:06.569 --> 00:15:08.640
Yeah, well, he's right.

197
00:15:10.228 --> 00:15:10.987
And he's nice.

198
00:15:12.333 --> 00:15:14.611
And the two of you were
always happy together.


199
00:15:15.647 --> 00:15:16.475
I guess.

200
00:15:19.030 --> 00:15:21.515
Honey, I'm glad you're
making an effort.


201
00:15:21.584 --> 00:15:24.380
You have really great friends...

202
00:15:24.449 --> 00:15:26.244
and they just want
what's best for you.


203
00:15:26.313 --> 00:15:28.280
So you like my friends?

204
00:15:28.349 --> 00:15:31.214
Yeah, of course.
Why would you?


205
00:15:31.283 --> 00:15:32.112
Nothing...

206
00:15:33.216 --> 00:15:34.321
- No? What?
- Nothing.


207
00:15:37.462 --> 00:15:38.635
This came in the mail.

208
00:15:39.809 --> 00:15:41.535
I think it's your
Letter of Intent.


209
00:15:44.503 --> 00:15:46.678
It's due the second
week of November.


210
00:15:49.129 --> 00:15:50.889
Don't they know what happened?

211
00:15:50.958 --> 00:15:51.959
Yeah.

212
00:15:52.028 --> 00:15:53.788
They know that you had a
minor head injury


213
00:15:53.858 --> 00:15:55.169
and it's kept you out of school.

214
00:15:55.238 --> 00:15:55.549
That's it?

215
00:15:56.930 --> 00:16:01.900
Honey, scholarships to elite
schools are very fragile.


216
00:16:03.108 --> 00:16:05.007
Just like the human brain,
huh?


217
00:16:06.767 --> 00:16:08.769
You don't think we should
tell them the whole story?


218
00:16:08.838 --> 00:16:10.875
I think we should give
it a few more weeks.


219
00:16:10.944 --> 00:16:14.602
State has an excellent
pre-law track.


220
00:16:14.671 --> 00:16:17.019
And that's something
you're quite interested in.


221
00:16:20.160 --> 00:16:22.438
So, what's with this?

222
00:16:22.507 --> 00:16:24.302
You brought it home one day.

223
00:16:24.371 --> 00:16:26.200
And I never said why?

224
00:16:27.408 --> 00:16:29.963
Did I want to learn how to play?
Or...


225
00:16:30.032 --> 00:16:31.930
Never said anything to me.

226
00:16:31.999 --> 00:16:34.760
I just thought you liked the
way it looked in your room.


227
00:18:01.433 --> 00:18:02.193
Good morning.

228
00:18:02.262 --> 00:18:03.194
Morning.

229
00:18:03.263 --> 00:18:04.195
Lexi and Heather will be here

230
00:18:04.264 --> 00:18:05.403
after their morning classes.

231
00:18:05.472 --> 00:18:07.922
So, make sure you're
caught up on your reading


232
00:18:07.992 --> 00:18:09.924
and started the worksheets,
okay?


233
00:18:09.994 --> 00:18:11.305
Okay.

234
00:18:11.374 --> 00:18:13.963
And um, if you need anything

235
00:18:15.413 --> 00:18:16.759
or you're not feeling well,

236
00:18:18.071 --> 00:18:20.142
hey, call me. Okay?

237
00:18:20.211 --> 00:18:25.147
Okay. Um, hey, do you mind
if I rearrange my bedroom?


238
00:18:29.151 --> 00:18:33.017
It's okay. Just um...
school work first,


239
00:18:33.086 --> 00:18:34.432
then decorating. Okay.

240
00:18:36.261 --> 00:18:39.678
And I was thinking, maybe you
could uh, mix in a run later.


241
00:18:39.747 --> 00:18:41.094
Get that body going again.

242
00:20:53.433 --> 00:20:56.263
Hey, I was in the
neighborhood.


243
00:20:56.332 --> 00:20:57.989
Just thought I'd
check in on you.


244
00:20:59.059 --> 00:21:00.612
Hi, I'm Cameron.

245
00:21:00.681 --> 00:21:01.820
We met the other day...

246
00:21:01.889 --> 00:21:03.581
Yeah. I just thought you
were my tutors.


247
00:21:03.650 --> 00:21:07.343
No, I'm in PE and we're
running cross country, so.


248
00:21:09.725 --> 00:21:12.072
Looks like you survived the
ride home the other day.


249
00:21:15.075 --> 00:21:18.182
So, I guess I'll uh...
see you around.


250
00:21:23.842 --> 00:21:27.329
Hey look um, I know this place

251
00:21:28.640 --> 00:21:32.541
isn't kind to those
who are lonely or lost.


252
00:21:32.610 --> 00:21:35.095
So just... track me down

253
00:21:35.164 --> 00:21:36.717
if you get feeling like that...

254
00:21:40.411 --> 00:21:45.485
Okay, we've got AP Calc.
AP Chemistry and AP Lit...


255
00:21:45.554 --> 00:21:47.314
And... don't forget.
AP Russian.


256
00:21:48.626 --> 00:21:51.594
First lesson, how to make
kick-ass screwdrivers.


257
00:21:51.663 --> 00:21:52.733
That's a horrible idea.

258
00:21:52.802 --> 00:21:53.838
Since when?

259
00:21:53.907 --> 00:21:56.323
Have you had that in
your bag all day?


260
00:21:56.392 --> 00:21:59.671
Yeah. I've got a whole new way

261
00:21:59.740 --> 00:22:01.121
to reintroduce you to yourself,
Al.


262
00:22:01.190 --> 00:22:02.433
Of course you have.

263
00:22:02.502 --> 00:22:06.057
You love this drink. We
have so many crazy stories


264
00:22:06.126 --> 00:22:06.989
of you and this drink.

265
00:22:07.058 --> 00:22:10.337
Did we actually
take AP Russian?


266
00:22:10.406 --> 00:22:11.373
No, honey.

267
00:22:11.442 --> 00:22:12.581
Alright, ladies.

268
00:22:15.135 --> 00:22:17.586
To unlocking Ali's brain.

269
00:22:17.655 --> 00:22:19.553
If you're uncomfortable
you really don't have to.


270
00:22:19.622 --> 00:22:21.072
It's a de-stress device.

271
00:22:30.875 --> 00:22:35.259
Woo. Come on. Loosen up
so we can get to work.


272
00:22:41.748 --> 00:22:43.094
There we go.

273
00:22:45.027 --> 00:22:46.960
This picture's from
Spring Break.


274
00:22:47.029 --> 00:22:48.064
Last year.

275
00:22:48.927 --> 00:22:49.721
That was crazy.

276
00:22:49.790 --> 00:22:51.275
The hotel was so bad.

277
00:22:51.344 --> 00:22:54.070
Heather found it on Yelp.
Three stars.


278
00:22:54.139 --> 00:22:56.383
I told her we shouldn't
go, but she insisted on it.


279
00:22:56.452 --> 00:22:57.764
I did.

280
00:22:57.833 --> 00:23:02.734
Okay, so... Tell me the
backstory of that picture...


281
00:23:05.081 --> 00:23:06.220
That is so cute...

282
00:23:06.290 --> 00:23:08.050
Oh my gosh. I remember
doing your hair for that.


283
00:23:08.119 --> 00:23:09.465
That's actually my shirt.

284
00:23:18.405 --> 00:23:20.545
Okay, that was good. Yeah.

285
00:23:23.721 --> 00:23:24.549
I got it.

286
00:23:25.792 --> 00:23:27.587
I was good at this?

287
00:23:27.656 --> 00:23:29.036
Yeah. Come on. 
Let's go again.

288
00:23:29.105 --> 00:23:29.658
Okay.

289
00:23:30.969 --> 00:23:33.558
Did I ever talk about
writing with you guys?


290
00:23:33.627 --> 00:23:34.421
What?

291
00:23:35.871 --> 00:23:38.529
Like... Poetry?

292
00:23:40.220 --> 00:23:41.911
Why? Do you
have an urge to drop


293
00:23:41.980 --> 00:23:43.085
some rhymes or something?

294
00:23:47.296 --> 00:23:48.435
What about guitar?

295
00:23:49.574 --> 00:23:51.645
You bought
it as a joke.


296
00:23:51.714 --> 00:23:53.613
There was an estate
sale over on Ambassador


297
00:23:53.682 --> 00:23:55.373
last summer and you
really wanted to go in.


298
00:23:55.442 --> 00:23:57.927
So, what was the joke?

299
00:23:57.996 --> 00:23:59.032
I don't really remember.

300
00:23:59.101 --> 00:24:01.655
But I think it was about
you take lessons.


301
00:24:01.724 --> 00:24:03.623
You had so much on your plate,

302
00:24:03.692 --> 00:24:05.383
you barely had time to breathe.

303
00:24:05.452 --> 00:24:08.800
Yeah, Student Council.
National Honor Society.


304
00:24:08.869 --> 00:24:10.526
Soccer... track...

305
00:24:10.595 --> 00:24:12.839
Mock trials... Tutoring.

306
00:24:12.908 --> 00:24:15.428
The list goes on and on
for Ali Spencer.


307
00:24:21.917 --> 00:24:22.745
He's here.

308
00:24:23.643 --> 00:24:25.092
What's going on?

309
00:24:25.161 --> 00:24:26.404
Field trip.

310
00:24:30.512 --> 00:24:31.513
Sit upfront.

311
00:24:36.759 --> 00:24:37.657
What's up ladies?

312
00:24:40.176 --> 00:24:43.248
He'll be extra careful, right?

313
00:24:43.317 --> 00:24:46.113
Yeah, I promise, Al.
Come on in.


314
00:24:53.466 --> 00:24:56.538
Yeah, this is my parents pre-
graduation, graduation gift.


315
00:24:56.607 --> 00:24:57.711
For real?

316
00:24:57.780 --> 00:25:00.300
Yeah, I got custom
plates on order too.


317
00:25:00.369 --> 00:25:02.475
Let me guess, "E
-Man"?

318
00:25:02.544 --> 00:25:04.304
No Lexi, not E
-Man.

319
00:25:05.478 --> 00:25:07.169
I was thinking 
- It's Lit.

320
00:25:07.238 --> 00:25:09.136
But I spell it all one
word, I-T-S-L-I-T...


321
00:25:09.205 --> 00:25:09.827
Clever.

322
00:25:09.896 --> 00:25:11.242
That's really beautiful.

323
00:25:11.311 --> 00:25:13.796
I don't know. I could have
went with "ETHAN" or E-Man


324
00:25:13.865 --> 00:25:15.833
but I just want to be
incognito some times.


325
00:25:15.902 --> 00:25:17.421
I'm not really an expert but,

326
00:25:17.490 --> 00:25:20.700
I think that's probably as
incognito as a train wreck.


327
00:25:20.769 --> 00:25:21.804
Shut up. It's gonna be sick,

328
00:25:21.873 --> 00:25:22.771
okay.

329
00:25:22.840 --> 00:25:23.875
Where are we going?

330
00:25:28.259 --> 00:25:30.054
Heather, you didn't tell her?

331
00:25:30.123 --> 00:25:32.297
If we told her, it might
mess up the impact.


332
00:25:32.366 --> 00:25:33.195
Seriously?

333
00:25:34.748 --> 00:25:37.302
Okay, Ali, so I
read that people


334
00:25:37.371 --> 00:25:40.927
with memory issues a lot
of the times visit places


335
00:25:40.996 --> 00:25:44.965
from their pasts to try
to reconnect with things.


336
00:25:45.034 --> 00:25:47.278
Okay, so what does that mean?

337
00:25:47.347 --> 00:25:49.176
Ali, we're going to
the crash site.


338
00:25:58.462 --> 00:25:59.911
We landed right there.

339
00:25:59.980 --> 00:26:01.257
Next to that fire hydrant
we took out that


340
00:26:01.326 --> 00:26:02.431
whole section of corn.

341
00:26:19.103 --> 00:26:20.863
Heather, you really
should have told her.


342
00:26:20.932 --> 00:26:22.313
She'll be fine, okay.

343
00:26:22.382 --> 00:26:23.417
I don't know guys.

344
00:26:34.601 --> 00:26:35.809
Hey, Ali.

345
00:26:40.469 --> 00:26:45.439
I'm sorry... this was
a shitty idea.


346
00:26:51.549 --> 00:26:52.688
Come on. Let's go back.

347
00:26:55.208 --> 00:26:56.278
Can I see the car?

348
00:27:19.370 --> 00:27:20.544
I can't believe
you climbed out


349
00:27:20.613 --> 00:27:22.131
of there with barely a scratch.

350
00:27:24.444 --> 00:27:26.446
Well... kind of...

351
00:27:38.907 --> 00:27:40.253
You'll be back soon, Ali.

352
00:27:52.852 --> 00:27:56.441
I wasn't sure the right
time to do this.


353
00:27:59.928 --> 00:28:03.345
You don't remember but, you
used to love wearing this.


354
00:28:08.522 --> 00:28:11.180
I got it for our
anniversary last year.


355
00:28:11.249 --> 00:28:12.078
Wow.

356
00:28:13.873 --> 00:28:15.564
Yeah the chain broke
during the accident.


357
00:28:15.633 --> 00:28:17.946
But one of the EMTs found
it on the floor


358
00:28:18.015 --> 00:28:20.880
and gave it back to me
so I had a jeweler give


359
00:28:20.949 --> 00:28:21.812
it a resetting.

360
00:28:24.159 --> 00:28:24.987
Thank you.

361
00:28:26.126 --> 00:28:27.403
May I?

362
00:28:27.472 --> 00:28:28.301
Yeah.

363
00:28:55.639 --> 00:28:58.952
Do you remember it?
The accident?


364
00:29:03.854 --> 00:29:04.648
Every bit.

365
00:29:07.651 --> 00:29:10.343
It all happened so fast but
when I look back on it now,


366
00:29:10.412 --> 00:29:13.726
it's like slow motion.

367
00:29:17.143 --> 00:29:18.351
The car came out of nowhere.

368
00:29:19.904 --> 00:29:22.493
I swerved to try to avoid it
but we ended up in the field.


369
00:29:25.599 --> 00:29:28.257
The airbags exploded and hit
you in the head pretty hard.


370
00:29:29.673 --> 00:29:30.501
You blacked out.

371
00:29:33.677 --> 00:29:38.578
We finally got you awake
you were really confused.


372
00:29:40.442 --> 00:29:41.685
It was a freak thing, Al.

373
00:29:49.727 --> 00:29:51.660
Look, I'm a little off
my game today.


374
00:29:56.734 --> 00:29:58.805
I don't know the first
thing to say to you.


375
00:29:59.737 --> 00:30:02.050
Or anything for that matter.

376
00:30:06.986 --> 00:30:07.780
I'm sorry, Al.

377
00:30:08.642 --> 00:30:09.885
No. Don't be.

378
00:30:09.954 --> 00:30:11.335
I don't think there's a playbook

379
00:30:11.404 --> 00:30:14.545
on how to connect with your
girlfriend who has amnesia.


380
00:30:18.135 --> 00:30:18.929
It's just...

381
00:30:24.279 --> 00:30:28.835
I don't know, something just
doesn't feel right about us.


382
00:30:28.904 --> 00:30:29.733
No?

383
00:30:31.079 --> 00:30:33.702
I mean a lot of things
since the accident


384
00:30:33.771 --> 00:30:34.772
haven't felt right.

385
00:30:37.948 --> 00:30:39.259
How so?

386
00:30:41.192 --> 00:30:42.746
Did you know I wrote poetry?

387
00:30:45.265 --> 00:30:46.094
No.

388
00:30:47.405 --> 00:30:51.099
Yeah, I found a journal
hidden under my mattress.


389
00:30:52.548 --> 00:30:53.377
Serious?

390
00:30:59.141 --> 00:31:01.730
Why couldn't I trust you
with something like that?


391
00:31:08.047 --> 00:31:11.602
Guys, it's
freezing, can we go?


392
00:32:26.746 --> 00:32:27.574
Dad.

393
00:32:29.714 --> 00:32:30.784
What's up?

394
00:32:30.854 --> 00:32:32.786
There was a great
song on the radio.


395
00:32:33.891 --> 00:32:35.444
So great it put you to sleep?

396
00:32:36.687 --> 00:32:38.102
Landslide.

397
00:32:38.171 --> 00:32:39.863
- That is a great song.
- Yeah.


398
00:32:47.456 --> 00:32:48.733
You work another double?

399
00:32:50.494 --> 00:32:52.358
I used to do them
standing on my head.


400
00:32:52.427 --> 00:32:54.153
Doubles feel more
like triples now.


401
00:32:55.740 --> 00:32:57.087
You just getting back
from school?


402
00:32:58.260 --> 00:33:00.814
Uh, no. Put in some
time at the park.


403
00:33:00.884 --> 00:33:02.126
Thought you wrapped that up.

404
00:33:03.231 --> 00:33:05.819
Almost. Got a few
more hours left.


405
00:37:15.345 --> 00:37:16.760
Hey...

406
00:37:16.829 --> 00:37:18.969
Oh, hey.

407
00:37:20.902 --> 00:37:23.042
You uh... Need directions?

408
00:37:23.111 --> 00:37:27.115
I'm good, actually.
You work here?


409
00:37:29.497 --> 00:37:32.741
Uh... Community
Service Learning.


410
00:37:34.674 --> 00:37:36.745
Actually, it's my last day.

411
00:37:36.814 --> 00:37:38.575
So, riding a bike.

412
00:37:38.644 --> 00:37:40.232
Your tutors seem to be
doing effective work.


413
00:37:40.301 --> 00:37:42.958
My tutors have tried
to bring my memory back


414
00:37:43.027 --> 00:37:47.480
through various methods,
there's soccer, vodka,


415
00:37:47.549 --> 00:37:49.310
bringing me to the scene
of the accident


416
00:37:49.379 --> 00:37:51.208
and showing me the wrecked car.

417
00:37:51.277 --> 00:37:52.692
How's that working out?

418
00:37:52.761 --> 00:37:55.108
Vodka gives me a headache.

419
00:37:55.178 --> 00:37:57.180
Soccer makes me feel
like a complete klutz.


420
00:37:57.249 --> 00:38:02.185
And the car lets me know
I'm lucky to be alive.


421
00:38:04.532 --> 00:38:06.465
Yeah, I'll bet.

422
00:38:06.534 --> 00:38:07.880
What you said yesterday,

423
00:38:09.295 --> 00:38:10.917
about feeling lost?

424
00:38:13.644 --> 00:38:15.577
Why did you say that to me?

425
00:38:15.646 --> 00:38:20.513
Just... Um. I've been there.

426
00:38:21.825 --> 00:38:25.553
And sometimes it feels
like it isn't allowed.


427
00:38:25.622 --> 00:38:29.142
Like being lost is a sign
of weakness or something


428
00:38:29.212 --> 00:38:31.628
which sucks 'cause
it's not true.


429
00:38:31.697 --> 00:38:35.356
And look, I cannot even
begin to imagine


430
00:38:35.425 --> 00:38:36.805
what you're going through

431
00:38:36.874 --> 00:38:38.255
or how you must be
feeling right now.


432
00:38:38.324 --> 00:38:42.501
Yeah, I'm just trying
to find myself, who I was


433
00:38:42.570 --> 00:38:44.986
and who I am, I guess.

434
00:38:45.055 --> 00:38:47.264
Anything you've uh discovered

435
00:38:47.333 --> 00:38:49.301
that's really surprised you?

436
00:38:49.370 --> 00:38:50.198
Yeah.

437
00:38:53.408 --> 00:38:56.204
A notebook that I
write poetry in.


438
00:38:56.273 --> 00:38:57.999
What kind of poems?

439
00:38:58.068 --> 00:39:00.173
I don't know. Just... poems...

440
00:39:00.243 --> 00:39:02.210
Teenage stuff, I guess.

441
00:39:02.279 --> 00:39:04.764
My friends don't seem to
know that I write poetry.


442
00:39:05.696 --> 00:39:06.801
Have you shown anybody?

443
00:39:06.870 --> 00:39:07.698
No.

444
00:39:10.114 --> 00:39:11.875
Well, what are you
waiting for?


445
00:39:11.944 --> 00:39:13.980
I guess I haven't
really thought about it.


446
00:39:14.049 --> 00:39:17.984
And yet, here we are...

447
00:39:18.053 --> 00:39:20.021
You know, Lexi and
Heather told me


448
00:39:20.090 --> 00:39:22.230
to be careful around you.

449
00:39:22.299 --> 00:39:24.025
Oh, you were talking about me.

450
00:39:25.268 --> 00:39:27.753
And they said it's not a
good idea if we hang out?


451
00:39:30.238 --> 00:39:31.826
Maybe you should listen to them.

452
00:39:34.691 --> 00:39:35.519
Hey, wait.

453
00:39:38.695 --> 00:39:41.042
They told me that you
would be here doing


454
00:39:41.111 --> 00:39:43.596
Community Service so I...

455
00:39:49.222 --> 00:39:54.158
I um... Do you really wanna see?

456
00:39:55.505 --> 00:39:56.609
The better question is,

457
00:39:56.678 --> 00:39:58.231
is it even worth the
effort because there


458
00:39:58.301 --> 00:40:01.545
could be tons "I" s dotted with
hearts and like unnecessary


459
00:40:01.614 --> 00:40:06.032
exclamation points and
unicorn stickers.


460
00:40:06.101 --> 00:40:07.793
There are a few hearts,

461
00:40:07.862 --> 00:40:10.727
but no unicorn stickers.

462
00:40:10.796 --> 00:40:11.900
Not yet anyway.

463
00:40:15.248 --> 00:40:17.389
I found this one poem
on a page with a ticket


464
00:40:17.458 --> 00:40:19.080
to the Art Museum.

465
00:40:19.149 --> 00:40:23.222
So I went there and found
this gorgeous painting


466
00:40:23.291 --> 00:40:25.742
with the same name.

467
00:40:27.709 --> 00:40:29.746
- Over Blue?
- Yeah.


468
00:40:29.815 --> 00:40:31.506
It must have meant
something to me.


469
00:40:32.783 --> 00:40:34.198
Ali, you know what this is?

470
00:40:37.132 --> 00:40:38.410
It's a treasure map.

471
00:40:39.342 --> 00:40:41.067
I don't understand.

472
00:40:41.136 --> 00:40:45.175
It's full of clues that may
lead you back to yourself,


473
00:40:45.244 --> 00:40:47.246
to parts of you hidden
from the world that


474
00:40:47.315 --> 00:40:49.386
need to be rediscovered.

475
00:40:49.455 --> 00:40:51.388
I mean you what we need
to do now, right?


476
00:40:52.769 --> 00:40:54.529
We have to decipher this thing.

477
00:40:54.598 --> 00:40:56.255
No, no we don't.

478
00:40:56.324 --> 00:40:59.016
C'mon, you cannot
put something


479
00:40:59.085 --> 00:40:59.948
like this in front of me

480
00:41:00.017 --> 00:41:02.157
and then just leave me hanging.

481
00:41:02.226 --> 00:41:03.227
That's not why I showed you.

482
00:41:03.296 --> 00:41:04.228
Then why did you?

483
00:41:07.715 --> 00:41:08.992
Look, I meant what I said,

484
00:41:10.476 --> 00:41:15.412
okay, if you want some help
navigating... any of this...


485
00:41:18.726 --> 00:41:20.279
What if I don't
like who I find


486
00:41:20.348 --> 00:41:21.798
when I get to the other side?

487
00:41:23.834 --> 00:41:25.802
Then I'd say you'd be
pretty normal.


488
00:41:39.229 --> 00:41:41.231
I cannot believe I
was ever good at this.


489
00:41:41.300 --> 00:41:42.405
It'll come back.

490
00:41:44.061 --> 00:41:47.133
Don't think so much.
Clear your mind,


491
00:41:47.202 --> 00:41:48.618
your muscles know what to do.

492
00:41:54.451 --> 00:41:55.279
That's my girl.

493
00:41:56.453 --> 00:41:58.628
Now we just need to
straighten it out.


494
00:41:58.697 --> 00:41:59.525
Alright.

495
00:41:59.594 --> 00:42:00.630
Twenty more of those

496
00:42:00.699 --> 00:42:02.390
and I may actually be
near the hole.


497
00:42:03.564 --> 00:42:04.392
Don't sweat it.

498
00:42:33.076 --> 00:42:34.215
Hey.

499
00:42:34.284 --> 00:42:37.080
Hey. Did I catch you in
the middle of something?


500
00:42:37.149 --> 00:42:39.047
AP Lit.

501
00:42:39.116 --> 00:42:40.877
Ahh... The Slaughterhouse.
How's that going?


502
00:42:40.946 --> 00:42:43.776
It's hard to say,
just started it.


503
00:42:43.845 --> 00:42:46.330
Hey there's something
in your poetry book.


504
00:42:46.399 --> 00:42:48.367
I didn't think about
it until this morning.


505
00:42:49.472 --> 00:42:52.095
The page with the dried flower.

506
00:42:52.164 --> 00:42:56.099
Emily's Rock or Emily's
Stone' or Emily's something.


507
00:42:56.168 --> 00:42:56.962
Do you know...

508
00:42:57.031 --> 00:42:57.790
Do you remember that?

509
00:42:57.859 --> 00:42:59.102
Yeah.

510
00:42:59.171 --> 00:43:02.001
I think I know what it is.

511
00:43:02.070 --> 00:43:03.727
Can I swing by and pick you up?

512
00:43:05.108 --> 00:43:07.490
I don't know, I've got
study group in a little bit.


513
00:43:07.559 --> 00:43:10.631
I promise to have you back
in time for soccer and shots.


514
00:43:10.700 --> 00:43:12.253
Cameron! Come on.
Just tell me!


515
00:43:12.322 --> 00:43:16.326
I think this really
should be experienced.


516
00:43:16.395 --> 00:43:17.879
Come on. I already
pawned one of my guitars


517
00:43:17.948 --> 00:43:19.432
to get a new tire for my bike.

518
00:43:20.848 --> 00:43:21.711
Okay.

519
00:43:38.555 --> 00:43:43.629
Oh, when you said bike ride
I thought you meant a bike. -


520
00:43:43.698 --> 00:43:44.906
- I brought you a helmet.

521
00:43:45.838 --> 00:43:47.081
I'm not going on that thing.

522
00:43:48.496 --> 00:43:51.085
It looks bad but it's
perfectly safe, I promise.


523
00:43:52.327 --> 00:43:53.536
It's my dad's.

524
00:43:53.605 --> 00:43:54.640
We're fixing it up.

525
00:43:54.709 --> 00:43:56.539
Haven't gotten very far
but it's sturdy.


526
00:43:57.643 --> 00:43:59.334
And I'm a very
responsible driver.


527
00:44:00.370 --> 00:44:02.303
I'm sure you are. But uh...

528
00:44:02.372 --> 00:44:04.339
You know, I read a
quote recently,


529
00:44:06.238 --> 00:44:10.898
once you become fearless,
you become limitless.


530
00:44:10.967 --> 00:44:12.278
Not funny.

531
00:44:12.347 --> 00:44:13.659
We'll take it slow.

532
00:44:13.728 --> 00:44:15.385
You get uncomfortable,
we'll stop.


533
00:44:20.252 --> 00:44:21.564
What do you say?

534
00:45:09.197 --> 00:45:11.406
I think it's over this way.

535
00:45:30.633 --> 00:45:33.325
Yeah... Here it is.

536
00:45:38.710 --> 00:45:41.540
She went to Mendon, which
is a school across town.


537
00:45:41.609 --> 00:45:43.438
And then to B.E. on a
soccer scholarship.


538
00:45:44.750 --> 00:45:46.579
Our schools are big rivals
so I'm thinking you guys


539
00:45:46.649 --> 00:45:49.134
played against each
other a few times.


540
00:45:49.203 --> 00:45:50.480
Oh my god... I knew her?

541
00:45:56.279 --> 00:45:57.660
How'd she die.

542
00:45:59.178 --> 00:46:02.561
OD. Pretty big deal
around here.


543
00:46:12.433 --> 00:46:13.676
I'll go wait by the bike.

544
00:46:16.713 --> 00:46:17.610
Cameron, wait.

545
00:46:28.967 --> 00:46:32.695
I can only hear myself breathe
as I stare at the stone.


546
00:46:34.627 --> 00:46:36.871
I'm trying to see her
face trying to find her,


547
00:46:38.010 --> 00:46:38.839
but she is gone.

548
00:46:40.495 --> 00:46:42.912
Swept away by the winds
of perfection...


549
00:46:44.879 --> 00:46:48.434
Around her... a lonely
patch of bright white


550
00:46:48.503 --> 00:46:49.988
filled with tiny blooms,

551
00:46:50.057 --> 00:46:53.750
trembling under a
windy onslaught.


552
00:46:53.819 --> 00:46:56.166
I tremble too...

553
00:46:57.616 --> 00:46:59.549
as I bend and sometimes break.

554
00:47:04.209 --> 00:47:07.730
But those blooms whitened
with lost innocence,


555
00:47:07.799 --> 00:47:10.491
remind me that I am free.

556
00:47:12.804 --> 00:47:14.288
I am very much alive.

557
00:47:15.530 --> 00:47:17.601
And life is still
awaiting me to live it.


558
00:47:32.789 --> 00:47:34.549
I'm not sure I was very happy.

559
00:47:38.657 --> 00:47:39.934
Well you're still here.

560
00:47:41.729 --> 00:47:44.663
And life is still
waiting for you...


561
00:48:16.660 --> 00:48:17.972
You have been
engrossed up there,


562
00:48:18.041 --> 00:48:19.180
I was calling.

563
00:48:19.249 --> 00:48:20.423
Emily Harris.

564
00:48:22.356 --> 00:48:23.150
Oh...

565
00:48:23.219 --> 00:48:24.047
How well did I know her?

566
00:48:25.911 --> 00:48:30.433
Not well. She was a
couple years older.


567
00:48:30.502 --> 00:48:33.781
You met at soccer camp
when you were a freshman.


568
00:48:33.850 --> 00:48:36.128
Seemed like she had a
pretty perfect life...


569
00:48:38.475 --> 00:48:39.614
Yeah, it was a shock.

570
00:48:41.927 --> 00:48:44.827
It was very sad.

571
00:48:48.382 --> 00:48:49.832
Do I like soccer?

572
00:48:50.902 --> 00:48:51.834
Of course you do.

573
00:48:53.214 --> 00:48:54.181
Ever since you were little,

574
00:48:54.250 --> 00:48:57.356
it lit some internal
fire in you.


575
00:48:57.425 --> 00:48:59.842
Your drive and your focus...

576
00:49:02.499 --> 00:49:04.329
I just don't feel
connected to it,


577
00:49:05.709 --> 00:49:08.781
and shouldn't I? Shouldn't
it be part of my DNA


578
00:49:08.851 --> 00:49:10.473
or my muscle memory
or something?


579
00:49:10.542 --> 00:49:11.923
It'll come back, honey.

580
00:49:12.855 --> 00:49:14.442
This is just stressful.

581
00:49:19.689 --> 00:49:21.104
You know what isn't stressful?

582
00:49:22.381 --> 00:49:24.867
Is your favorite double
chocolate brownies


583
00:49:24.936 --> 00:49:26.869
since you were like
two years old.


584
00:49:35.222 --> 00:49:35.981
Good, right?

585
00:49:36.050 --> 00:49:36.879
Hmm hm.

586
00:49:43.023 --> 00:49:44.921
Thought you had work.

587
00:49:46.750 --> 00:49:49.167
Needed to get out of
there for a few minutes.


588
00:49:49.236 --> 00:49:50.030
Rough night?

589
00:49:51.755 --> 00:49:53.896
It's Friday. And a full moon.

590
00:49:56.346 --> 00:49:58.590
I saw that you put a
tire on the bike.


591
00:49:58.659 --> 00:50:00.523
Got it at the scrap yard.

592
00:50:00.592 --> 00:50:02.111
Got a new rim too.

593
00:50:02.180 --> 00:50:03.560
Still won't pass inspection.

594
00:50:04.596 --> 00:50:06.046
The brake pads gotta be thin.

595
00:50:06.115 --> 00:50:08.738
Yeah, I was thinking maybe
we could work on it together.


596
00:50:13.053 --> 00:50:15.158
Also thought maybe we
could paint the house.


597
00:50:19.231 --> 00:50:21.130
What do you thing about that?

598
00:50:26.583 --> 00:50:28.206
Hours are crazy right now.

599
00:50:32.831 --> 00:50:35.385
Cam, it's not a good time
for a tantrum.


600
00:50:38.423 --> 00:50:39.631
Nothing's gonna get better

601
00:50:39.700 --> 00:50:41.219
if we don't put some
effort into it.


602
00:53:00.082 --> 00:53:02.118
The town abandoned this
in the seventies


603
00:53:03.913 --> 00:53:07.882
and ever since it's become
like a rite of passage


604
00:53:07.951 --> 00:53:10.299
for any knucklehead looking
to leave their mark somewhere.


605
00:53:10.368 --> 00:53:12.266
Did you leave your mark here?

606
00:53:12.335 --> 00:53:14.475
Do I look like a
knucklehead to you?


607
00:53:23.829 --> 00:53:24.968
What do you think?

608
00:53:25.037 --> 00:53:28.731
I don't know. The sign
says no trespassing.


609
00:53:28.800 --> 00:53:31.699
Your poem is about
facing your fears.


610
00:53:31.768 --> 00:53:33.529
I think this is symbolic
of all the things


611
00:53:33.598 --> 00:53:35.427
you're afraid of...

612
00:53:35.496 --> 00:53:38.050
Cameron, you just finished
your community service.


613
00:53:38.741 --> 00:53:39.776
If we get caught...

614
00:53:39.845 --> 00:53:42.607
I did, but this is
something that


615
00:53:42.676 --> 00:53:43.987
was clearly tormenting you.

616
00:53:45.403 --> 00:53:48.371
And I have an obligation to
assist you on your quest.


617
00:53:50.856 --> 00:53:52.134
I don't think we should.

618
00:53:55.067 --> 00:53:56.483
I think you really want to.

619
00:54:05.733 --> 00:54:07.183
Out of my way knucklehead.

620
00:54:22.198 --> 00:54:24.166
What is it you're afraid of?

621
00:54:24.235 --> 00:54:25.650
Afraid of falling?

622
00:54:25.719 --> 00:54:27.755
Flying into the unknown.

623
00:54:29.861 --> 00:54:32.277
Afraid that if I show
my whole self,


624
00:54:32.346 --> 00:54:34.245
the world will turn
its back on me.


625
00:54:37.834 --> 00:54:39.491
Be careful.

626
00:54:39.560 --> 00:54:42.460
That once I am open, I
may be left standing alone.


627
00:54:44.462 --> 00:54:45.428
Like I am now.

628
00:54:48.259 --> 00:54:51.676
Resisting all risk, even
as it rumbles,


629
00:54:53.195 --> 00:54:56.577
even as something hits my
heart with ferocious might,


630
00:55:00.236 --> 00:55:01.824
like a war between what is

631
00:55:01.893 --> 00:55:03.274
and what could be.

632
00:55:06.415 --> 00:55:10.764
And my fear that I may
never be free.


633
00:55:17.909 --> 00:55:22.914
This is The Grove...

634
00:55:34.236 --> 00:55:35.064
Come on.

635
00:57:09.710 --> 00:57:11.367
No way.

636
00:57:11.436 --> 00:57:12.817
I think you should...

637
00:57:12.886 --> 00:57:15.475
I'm pretty sure I was
not an artist.


638
00:57:18.995 --> 00:57:20.238
These walls are
for everyone...


639
00:57:21.343 --> 00:57:23.172
You made the trek, now
leave your mark.


640
00:58:02.763 --> 00:58:06.008
I've never lived outside
the confines of my mind.


641
00:58:06.077 --> 00:58:08.493
And I suppose I still don't.

642
00:58:08.562 --> 00:58:10.322
It's like the world
is a picture.


643
00:58:10.392 --> 00:58:12.152
And the only way for
me to be in it,


644
00:58:12.221 --> 00:58:14.568
is looking at it from afar.

645
00:58:19.677 --> 00:58:21.989
So until that picture
becomes my reality,


646
00:58:22.058 --> 00:58:24.785
and not just this constructed
image now imprinted


647
00:58:24.854 --> 00:58:29.411
in my memory, I will stay
on the outside looking in.


648
00:58:38.143 --> 00:58:42.907
So, my prince, wherever
you are, hold me close.


649
00:58:42.976 --> 00:58:45.530
And whisper in my ear your
fear of letting me go.


650
00:58:46.600 --> 00:58:48.015
I wanna see the world.

651
00:58:48.084 --> 00:58:51.156
And when I do, will you
come with me?


652
00:58:52.537 --> 00:58:57.473
So, my prince, all I want
are, simple little things.


653
00:58:59.613 --> 00:59:01.166
All things sweet.

654
00:59:02.236 --> 00:59:03.893
All things love...

655
00:59:04.860 --> 00:59:07.690
And in return, 
I will love you.

656
00:59:08.691 --> 00:59:10.279
All the way.

657
00:59:19.288 --> 00:59:20.772
Crisp air and chilled bones.

658
00:59:22.187 --> 00:59:25.363
Light laughter crunches
through the autumn leaves.


659
00:59:25.432 --> 00:59:29.850
New desires are beginning
to take ahold of me


660
00:59:29.919 --> 00:59:34.165
as I see them wisp through
every skeleton in the patch


661
00:59:34.234 --> 00:59:37.064
They stand there bare
to all of us.


662
00:59:37.133 --> 00:59:39.481
and when I look into
their funny faces,


663
00:59:40.861 --> 00:59:42.069
I wanna be bare too...

664
00:59:45.176 --> 00:59:47.489
I want to be stripped
of this old skin


665
00:59:47.558 --> 00:59:50.492
and slip into one that
feels most like me.


666
00:59:52.666 --> 00:59:55.255
Baring my soul to the world.

667
01:00:03.159 --> 01:00:04.782
Does she ever really see me?

668
01:00:06.059 --> 01:00:08.406
Or does she only see
what she wants to see.


669
01:00:09.718 --> 01:00:13.411
Her eyes always keen on
what could be for me.


670
01:00:14.412 --> 01:00:16.448
But my vision lies elsewhere.

671
01:00:17.829 --> 01:00:21.661
My eyes veer off into
countless other directions.


672
01:00:24.111 --> 01:00:27.908
How could I just ignore all
these melodies soft and subtle


673
01:00:27.977 --> 01:00:32.257
as they ring a beckoning
call into my curious ears.


674
01:00:32.326 --> 01:00:33.845
And into my earning heart.

675
01:00:34.846 --> 01:00:36.365
I can hear music in the making.

676
01:00:37.711 --> 01:00:39.955
I can feel life in the making.

677
01:00:42.129 --> 01:00:43.199
Okay... Go?

678
01:00:43.268 --> 01:00:44.097
Yeah.

679
01:00:46.340 --> 01:00:49.447
So my prince,
wherever you are,


680
01:00:50.793 --> 01:00:52.139
please come with me.

681
01:00:53.313 --> 01:00:57.213
I won't ask for much, I promise.

682
01:00:59.733 --> 01:01:03.979
All I want are simple
little things.


683
01:01:05.636 --> 01:01:09.605
All things sweet... all
things love...


684
01:01:10.986 --> 01:01:15.887
and in return... I will
love you all the way.


685
01:01:22.238 --> 01:01:23.723
Nice. Okay, try it
with the thumb.


686
01:01:23.792 --> 01:01:25.656
No, F-sharp... that's the G.

687
01:01:25.725 --> 01:01:27.278
Yeah, right there.

688
01:01:28.486 --> 01:01:30.937
Yeah see... that sounds better,
right?


689
01:01:31.006 --> 01:01:32.386
Try the lick I showed you.

690
01:01:32.455 --> 01:01:33.387
Uh...

691
01:01:38.876 --> 01:01:39.911
There it is.

692
01:01:39.980 --> 01:01:43.984
Nice.

693
01:01:44.053 --> 01:01:46.987
So, can I ask you something?

694
01:01:48.126 --> 01:01:48.955
Sure.

695
01:01:49.024 --> 01:01:50.991
But you have to be honest.

696
01:01:51.060 --> 01:01:53.545
Well that might take
the fun out of the answer.


697
01:01:53.615 --> 01:01:55.582
Seriously honest.

698
01:01:56.790 --> 01:01:57.619
Got it.

699
01:01:59.793 --> 01:02:01.001
Was I nice?

700
01:02:04.004 --> 01:02:06.524
How would you define
"seriously honest" actually?


701
01:02:11.943 --> 01:02:14.463
Look... I'm sure if you
polled the student body,


702
01:02:14.532 --> 01:02:16.292
the majority would say
you were nice.


703
01:02:17.604 --> 01:02:20.780
People like you. They
like being around you.


704
01:02:20.849 --> 01:02:23.955
You have this sort of momentum,

705
01:02:24.024 --> 01:02:28.580
this energy, like you're
gonna lead the charge


706
01:02:28.650 --> 01:02:29.961
and rip through a banner
and lead the team


707
01:02:30.030 --> 01:02:32.032
onto the next playing
field or something.


708
01:02:32.964 --> 01:02:36.071
But uh... I won't lie,

709
01:02:36.140 --> 01:02:39.453
there'd probably be some
people who said


710
01:02:39.522 --> 01:02:40.834
you're maybe not so nice...

711
01:02:42.456 --> 01:02:43.285
Keep going.

712
01:02:45.011 --> 01:02:49.947
That you have the ability to
look right through people...


713
01:02:51.742 --> 01:02:54.123
even if you're looking right
at them talking to them.


714
01:02:57.264 --> 01:03:02.235
Wasn't always that way but
in the last year or so, yeah.


715
01:03:07.171 --> 01:03:11.416
You know people who have that
power might not understand it,


716
01:03:11.485 --> 01:03:13.971
but for those of us who
it's been used against,


717
01:03:14.040 --> 01:03:15.282
we know it very well.

718
01:03:18.113 --> 01:03:20.080
I uh did this to you?

719
01:03:22.151 --> 01:03:23.325
Does it matter?

720
01:03:23.394 --> 01:03:25.499
Well yeah we were friends,
right?


721
01:03:27.191 --> 01:03:29.055
Last time we talked was
freshman year.


722
01:03:32.092 --> 01:03:33.438
Excuse me.

723
01:03:33.507 --> 01:03:35.751
You're not giving
me much here.


724
01:03:37.235 --> 01:03:39.755
♪ Not much to say ♪

725
01:03:39.824 --> 01:03:40.894
I don't believe you.

726
01:03:43.759 --> 01:03:45.692
Come on. What aren't
you telling me?


727
01:03:45.761 --> 01:03:46.589
Nothing.

728
01:03:49.144 --> 01:03:50.559
Tell me something about us.

729
01:04:00.155 --> 01:04:01.708
There was no us.

730
01:04:06.920 --> 01:04:09.681
Oh no. You thief. You thief.

731
01:04:09.751 --> 01:04:10.613
This is my guitar.

732
01:04:11.511 --> 01:04:12.305
Ali.

733
01:04:14.100 --> 01:04:15.618
What the hell's going on here,
Reed?


734
01:04:15.687 --> 01:04:17.068
Like what are you
even doing here?


735
01:04:17.137 --> 01:04:19.001
What are you guys
even doing here?


736
01:04:19.070 --> 01:04:21.038
Looking for you, you're not
returning any of our messages.


737
01:04:21.107 --> 01:04:22.522
Look, Ali, if you wanted
to break up with me,


738
01:04:22.591 --> 01:04:23.592
you could have just said
it to my face.


739
01:04:23.661 --> 01:04:24.420
Ethan, please.

740
01:04:24.489 --> 01:04:25.525
Dude, you really should chill.

741
01:04:25.594 --> 01:04:27.561
And you should really
leave her alone,


742
01:04:27.630 --> 01:04:29.391
not get her involved
in your shit.


743
01:04:29.460 --> 01:04:30.530
My shit?

744
01:04:30.599 --> 01:04:31.980
Oh, you wanna say something,
dickhead?


745
01:04:32.049 --> 01:04:32.808
Seriously, dude?

746
01:04:32.877 --> 01:04:34.154
Alright guys, stop it.

747
01:04:35.431 --> 01:04:38.158
Ali, I don't get this.

748
01:04:38.227 --> 01:04:40.471
Ethan, get out.

749
01:04:40.540 --> 01:04:41.437
Guys get out!

750
01:04:45.925 --> 01:04:47.478
Get out of here.

751
01:04:47.547 --> 01:04:48.375
Ethan.

752
01:04:52.966 --> 01:04:56.798
Ali, hey, we were
just worried about you.


753
01:04:56.867 --> 01:04:57.557
You totally ghosted us, okay?

754
01:04:57.626 --> 01:04:58.800
What's with you?

755
01:04:58.869 --> 01:05:01.768
I'm just... I just need
some time, you guys.


756
01:05:01.837 --> 01:05:02.838
With Cameron?

757
01:05:02.907 --> 01:05:03.908
Heather.

758
01:05:03.977 --> 01:05:05.876
No. Okay, you can't do
that to Ethan.


759
01:05:05.945 --> 01:05:07.291
That sucks, Ali.

760
01:05:07.360 --> 01:05:08.188
Whoa.

761
01:05:09.086 --> 01:05:10.639
I'm sorry.

762
01:05:10.708 --> 01:05:12.848
Alright, just... I just
wanna be alone.


763
01:05:14.091 --> 01:05:15.989
Maybe you should talk
to Ethan first.


764
01:05:16.058 --> 01:05:17.749
I don't know what you
want me to say, Heather.


765
01:05:17.819 --> 01:05:19.855
You don't have to say
anything right now. It can wait.


766
01:05:19.924 --> 01:05:20.683
Lex I think she should...

767
01:05:20.752 --> 01:05:21.581
It can wait.

768
01:05:24.032 --> 01:05:25.516
We'll call you later.

769
01:06:18.258 --> 01:06:20.295
Hey, Ali, it's Cameron.

770
01:06:20.364 --> 01:06:22.676
Um. Look, I'm sorry
about earlier,


771
01:06:22.745 --> 01:06:24.264
that wasn't cool.

772
01:06:24.333 --> 01:06:25.921
I shouldn't of engaged
with Ethan at all


773
01:06:25.990 --> 01:06:29.787
and um... I'm sure that was
really stressful for you.


774
01:06:31.893 --> 01:06:32.790
Hope you're okay.

775
01:06:35.655 --> 01:06:36.932
Yeah, give me a call. Okay?

776
01:06:43.801 --> 01:06:45.147
What's going on with
you Cameron Reed?


777
01:06:45.216 --> 01:06:46.252
What?

778
01:06:46.321 --> 01:06:48.150
What's going on with
Cameron Reed?


779
01:06:48.219 --> 01:06:49.807
Nothing. We're friends.

780
01:06:49.876 --> 01:06:51.913
Have you been riding on
his motorcycle?


781
01:06:51.982 --> 01:06:52.741
Who told you that?

782
01:06:52.810 --> 01:06:53.397
Have you been?

783
01:06:54.674 --> 01:06:56.779
Ali, you cannot do that!
You will not do that!


784
01:06:56.848 --> 01:06:58.367
Oh okay, so now
you're telling me


785
01:06:58.436 --> 01:06:59.679
what I can and can't do?

786
01:06:59.748 --> 01:07:01.957
Uh... yes. Last time I
checked I was your mother.


787
01:07:02.026 --> 01:07:03.441
Feel free to step in
here any time now.


788
01:07:03.510 --> 01:07:05.029
Let's just all take
a breath here.


789
01:07:05.098 --> 01:07:07.929
Honey, sounds like Cameron
has his own issues.


790
01:07:07.998 --> 01:07:09.861
Oh. Okay well maybe one
day I'll find some friends


791
01:07:09.931 --> 01:07:11.242
without issues.

792
01:07:11.311 --> 01:07:15.246
'Cause Lexi, Heather, Ethan,
they're perfect, right?


793
01:07:15.315 --> 01:07:16.075
This sounds a
little different.


794
01:07:16.144 --> 01:07:17.490
Honey, maybe he's not the best

795
01:07:17.559 --> 01:07:18.732
support system for
you right now.


796
01:07:18.801 --> 01:07:19.837
You're amazing.

797
01:07:19.906 --> 01:07:21.597
Look, we know you're
going through


798
01:07:21.666 --> 01:07:22.978
something difficult right now

799
01:07:23.047 --> 01:07:25.498
but maybe leaning on
Cameron isn't the best way.


800
01:07:25.567 --> 01:07:28.708
No. No. No. Nobody knows
what I'm going through.


801
01:07:28.777 --> 01:07:31.676
Not you, not the doctors,
not the specialists.


802
01:07:31.745 --> 01:07:33.851
Okay, nobody has an idea
what I should do.


803
01:07:33.920 --> 01:07:36.923
And now you guys magically
know what I shouldn't do?


804
01:07:36.992 --> 01:07:39.098
We want you safe,
honey. We want you happy.


805
01:07:39.167 --> 01:07:41.203
It's a little too
late for that.


806
01:07:41.272 --> 01:07:43.930
Okay. Terry Hughes called,
from State.


807
01:07:43.999 --> 01:07:45.483
She wants to know when
you're gonna sign.


808
01:07:45.552 --> 01:07:47.209
I don't think I should.

809
01:07:47.278 --> 01:07:49.418
We have to consider
unintended consequences here.


810
01:07:49.487 --> 01:07:51.248
You'd basically lose
everything you've been


811
01:07:51.317 --> 01:07:52.939
working towards for
seventeen years.


812
01:07:53.008 --> 01:07:55.942
You do realize that I may
never be that person again.


813
01:07:57.564 --> 01:08:00.084
Okay, I may never be that "Ali"
again.


814
01:08:00.153 --> 01:08:02.984
How about giving that Ali
just a little more time.


815
01:08:04.261 --> 01:08:06.470
She really is a
wonderful person, you know.


816
01:08:07.471 --> 01:08:08.713
I'm sure she was great.

817
01:08:11.509 --> 01:08:16.031
Look, Ali, the truth is,
things have been tight lately.


818
01:08:17.239 --> 01:08:18.930
And if you want what
State has to offer


819
01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:21.002
you're gonna need
that scholarship.


820
01:08:21.071 --> 01:08:23.659
Honestly, I don't
know what I want.


821
01:08:23.728 --> 01:08:25.834
Do you wanna start
from scratch?


822
01:08:25.903 --> 01:08:28.147
Get a new passion, maybe
get good enough at it


823
01:08:28.216 --> 01:08:28.733
to set you apart...

824
01:08:28.802 --> 01:08:30.011
Stop.

825
01:08:30.080 --> 01:08:32.599
Try a new college, get
another scholarship maybe?


826
01:08:32.668 --> 01:08:35.050
Or maybe you want to
try community college.


827
01:08:35.119 --> 01:08:37.363
Honestly, we did not
raise you to be this way.


828
01:08:42.609 --> 01:08:43.645
You happy now?

829
01:08:43.714 --> 01:08:45.543
Thank you very much
for the support.


830
01:09:44.809 --> 01:09:47.778
Hey... You found me. You good?

831
01:09:51.437 --> 01:09:52.714
I've got to take a break, Cam.

832
01:09:52.783 --> 01:09:56.718
I'm kind of over all
of this mystery stuff.


833
01:09:56.787 --> 01:09:59.859
I thought you were excited
about what you're finding.


834
01:09:59.928 --> 01:10:02.137
About the you no one
knew existed.


835
01:10:03.345 --> 01:10:04.519
I don't know if she's real.

836
01:10:05.692 --> 01:10:08.419
She's real. She's just
kind of afraid.


837
01:10:08.488 --> 01:10:09.903
And why wouldn't she be?

838
01:10:09.972 --> 01:10:12.354
I don't know, I have to get
back on track with college.


839
01:10:12.423 --> 01:10:16.117
And et back on track
with finding Ali.


840
01:10:17.670 --> 01:10:19.948
I thought that's what
we were doing.


841
01:10:20.017 --> 01:10:21.674
You know what I mean.

842
01:11:01.472 --> 01:11:02.508
That was
much better guys.


843
01:11:02.577 --> 01:11:05.131
It's very important
to keep working


844
01:11:05.200 --> 01:11:07.064
our angles on the ball...
okay...


845
01:11:07.996 --> 01:11:09.135
Pass and move.

846
01:11:18.386 --> 01:11:19.628
Let's go again.

847
01:12:51.651 --> 01:12:53.170
Cold?

848
01:12:53.239 --> 01:12:54.240
Oh, you don't have to.

849
01:12:54.309 --> 01:12:56.794
Yeah, but I'm gonna.

850
01:12:59.210 --> 01:13:00.004
Thanks.

851
01:13:02.593 --> 01:13:04.146
I'm really glad you
came out tonight.


852
01:13:05.838 --> 01:13:06.666
Yeah, me too.

853
01:13:07.874 --> 01:13:09.635
It sucks not
having you around.


854
01:13:10.774 --> 01:13:12.258
My mom misses you.

855
01:13:15.123 --> 01:13:15.882
Really?

856
01:13:15.951 --> 01:13:16.780
Oh yeah.

857
01:13:20.577 --> 01:13:23.752
Look, I've been thinking about

858
01:13:23.821 --> 01:13:25.685
what you said the last
time we were here.


859
01:13:26.548 --> 01:13:28.170
About us not making sense.

860
01:13:29.448 --> 01:13:32.485
Look, a lot of things
have been coming at me...


861
01:13:32.554 --> 01:13:34.004
I know... hang on a second.

862
01:13:34.936 --> 01:13:37.318
I really wanna tell you this.

863
01:13:40.666 --> 01:13:44.704
I don't know if... I don't know
if I appreciated you enough.


864
01:13:46.982 --> 01:13:49.433
Well, I know I didn't.

865
01:13:49.502 --> 01:13:51.746
And now with everything
that's been happening.


866
01:13:53.023 --> 01:13:54.576
We're at this weird ground zero.

867
01:13:57.096 --> 01:13:58.477
I wonder if we have a chance.

868
01:14:00.375 --> 01:14:04.690
I mean I know you, I
know our history.


869
01:14:06.899 --> 01:14:08.176
But you don't know me.

870
01:14:10.730 --> 01:14:11.593
Is that even fair?

871
01:14:14.700 --> 01:14:18.289
Can there be this... this
different version of us.


872
01:14:19.843 --> 01:14:21.465
You know that gets to
what we had?


873
01:14:23.294 --> 01:14:25.158
You mean, a different
version of me.


874
01:14:34.513 --> 01:14:38.586
How was it? Were we happy?

875
01:14:42.106 --> 01:14:45.213
Yeah. I mean we
had our moments


876
01:14:45.282 --> 01:14:48.665
but, yeah, we were happy.

877
01:14:51.150 --> 01:14:53.394
We had the whole wide world, Al.

878
01:14:55.326 --> 01:14:57.639
Just want to get back
there with you.


879
01:14:58.951 --> 01:15:00.262
That sounds really nice.

880
01:15:03.162 --> 01:15:03.990
Yeah?

881
01:15:14.173 --> 01:15:15.001
Okay?

882
01:15:15.830 --> 01:15:17.038
Yeah.

883
01:15:28.463 --> 01:15:29.291
What's wrong?

884
01:15:32.191 --> 01:15:37.127
It's just... I just
don't feel like it.


885
01:15:39.440 --> 01:15:41.442
Yeah. Yeah, okay...

886
01:15:43.582 --> 01:15:44.962
I'm gonna get going.

887
01:15:45.031 --> 01:15:47.378
Come on, why? We were
having a good time, Al.


888
01:15:49.001 --> 01:15:52.901
Look, I understand if
you want to break up.


889
01:15:54.178 --> 01:15:56.111
It's not fair to you to
have to sit around


890
01:15:56.180 --> 01:15:58.389
and wait for whatever we
had to come back;


891
01:16:00.806 --> 01:16:02.152
it might not.

892
01:16:03.429 --> 01:16:05.466
Al, I'm gonna wait as
long as I have to.


893
01:16:07.329 --> 01:16:08.434
Maybe you shouldn't.

894
01:16:16.684 --> 01:16:17.478
No.

895
01:16:19.859 --> 01:16:22.103
What do you mean, no?

896
01:16:23.829 --> 01:16:25.037
I mean... I mean... no.

897
01:16:25.106 --> 01:16:26.487
It's not happening.

898
01:16:27.488 --> 01:16:28.834
Ali, we're not breaking up.

899
01:16:34.874 --> 01:16:35.703
Come on.

900
01:16:36.842 --> 01:16:37.601

Hey... welcome back.

910
01:19:54.384 --> 01:19:55.281
Hey.

911
01:19:55.350 --> 01:19:56.869
It's good to see you.

912
01:19:56.938 --> 01:19:58.077
Ali, right?

913
01:19:59.182 --> 01:20:00.217
Yeah.

914
01:20:00.286 --> 01:20:01.909
You're just in time.

915
01:20:01.978 --> 01:20:04.290
Potluck Saturday. Grab a plate.

916
01:20:06.741 --> 01:20:08.329
Is everything okay, honey?

917
01:20:09.261 --> 01:20:11.539
Yeah. Yeah, thank you.

918
01:20:11.608 --> 01:20:12.954
How's the poetry going?

919
01:20:14.024 --> 01:20:16.164
Oh. Um. It's...

920
01:20:16.233 --> 01:20:19.720
We have open mic next
week if you're up to it.


921
01:20:21.066 --> 01:20:23.309
I'd love to hear what
you've been working on.


922
01:20:24.310 --> 01:20:25.691
Yeah, maybe...

923
01:20:25.760 --> 01:20:27.762
Well fill up and I'll
stop by in a bit.


924
01:20:50.164 --> 01:20:54.720
Hey, everyone. I'm so excited
that you came here tonight.


925
01:20:54.789 --> 01:20:58.137
It means a lot to me to
see everyone here.


926
01:20:58.206 --> 01:21:00.622
I'm far from the first
person to tell you


927
01:21:00.691 --> 01:21:03.211
that growing up is hard.

928
01:21:03.280 --> 01:21:08.251
The friendships, the pressure
to be perfect, anxiety,


929
01:21:08.320 --> 01:21:10.529
feeling like you're
not good enough


930
01:21:10.598 --> 01:21:13.670
and having to keep up
grades and extracurriculars


931
01:21:13.739 --> 01:21:15.499
and make a million
different choices about


932
01:21:15.568 --> 01:21:17.605
the rest of your life.

933
01:21:17.674 --> 01:21:19.745
It's heavy stuff.

934
01:21:19.814 --> 01:21:22.403
The pressure is daunting.

935
01:21:22.472 --> 01:21:25.786
But we're here to help you
carry some of that burden.


936
01:21:25.855 --> 01:21:27.649
And you're not in this alone.

937
01:21:41.318 --> 01:21:42.147
Ali Spencer.

938
01:21:45.460 --> 01:21:46.289
You there?

939
01:21:48.325 --> 01:21:49.154
Yeah.

940
01:21:50.431 --> 01:21:51.812
Everything okay?

941
01:21:54.297 --> 01:21:55.712
Everything is not okay.

942
01:22:00.510 --> 01:22:02.167
It is so not okay.

943
01:22:03.996 --> 01:22:05.273
What happened?

944
01:22:10.554 --> 01:22:11.383
Ali?

945
01:22:17.354 --> 01:22:18.839
Cam I don't know who I am.

946
01:22:22.912 --> 01:22:24.810
Ali, where are you?

947
01:22:24.879 --> 01:22:26.950
I don't understand why.

948
01:22:32.266 --> 01:22:33.992
I'm not who everybody
wants me to be.


949
01:22:34.061 --> 01:22:35.476
I'm not who my mom
wants me to be.


950
01:22:35.545 --> 01:22:37.029
I'm not who my dad...

951
01:22:40.550 --> 01:22:42.172
I'm sorry.

952
01:22:42.241 --> 01:22:43.691
Ali, tell me where you are.

953
01:23:04.815 --> 01:23:05.644
Ali!

954
01:23:10.891 --> 01:23:11.719
Ali!

955
01:23:14.895 --> 01:23:15.723
Ali!

956
01:23:19.209 --> 01:23:20.003
Ali!

957
01:23:23.248 --> 01:23:24.042
Shit.

958
01:23:25.767 --> 01:23:28.529
You really like testing fate,
huh?


959
01:23:39.954 --> 01:23:41.197
What happened?

960
01:23:45.166 --> 01:23:48.204
I feel like the walls
are closing in on me.


961
01:23:52.277 --> 01:23:55.590
I've felt that.
I've been there.


962
01:23:55.659 --> 01:23:56.937
Sometimes I'm still there.

963
01:23:58.490 --> 01:24:00.630
How do you make it stop?

964
01:24:02.770 --> 01:24:04.392
Wish I had the answer.

965
01:24:09.501 --> 01:24:13.263
My mind gets very crowded.

966
01:24:14.920 --> 01:24:17.164
And there are things
that I can't get past.


967
01:24:18.579 --> 01:24:19.856
Things my dad can't get past.

968
01:24:19.925 --> 01:24:23.860
But... here I am...

969
01:24:25.758 --> 01:24:26.759
still going.

970
01:24:34.560 --> 01:24:36.286
My mom died a few years ago.

971
01:24:38.185 --> 01:24:42.051
Cancer. And um... I
don't know...


972
01:24:42.120 --> 01:24:46.814
It was pretty brutal
up until the end there.


973
01:24:46.883 --> 01:24:49.920
And uh... my dad and I

974
01:24:49.990 --> 01:24:51.922
have been sort of out of
it ever since.


975
01:24:54.891 --> 01:24:58.274
So, I know. I get it.

976
01:24:59.551 --> 01:25:02.726
There are things that are
really hard to get past.


977
01:25:05.522 --> 01:25:08.422
But, Ali, you just do.

978
01:25:10.872 --> 01:25:13.254
Just one foot in front
of the other.


979
01:25:18.397 --> 01:25:20.813
I got a lot of free
space up here, Cameron.


980
01:25:24.300 --> 01:25:27.682
If those memories ever
get too heavy,


981
01:25:29.788 --> 01:25:31.479
I'm happy to help you carry 'em.

982
01:25:42.111 --> 01:25:45.355
Hey, what are you
doing up here?


983
01:25:46.770 --> 01:25:50.084
No registration. No insurance.

984
01:25:51.844 --> 01:25:54.364
Three years un-inspected.

985
01:25:55.400 --> 01:25:56.677
Really?

986
01:25:56.746 --> 01:25:59.956
Congratulations, your
bike's going to the pound.


987
01:26:19.734 --> 01:26:22.530
Ali, what is this?
Is it Cameron?


988
01:26:22.599 --> 01:26:25.464
No it's not. Okay, it's me.

989
01:26:25.533 --> 01:26:27.017
No... this is not you.

990
01:26:27.087 --> 01:26:28.985
Climbing into The Grove,
criminal mischief,


991
01:26:29.054 --> 01:26:30.400
do you have any idea how
close you came


992
01:26:30.469 --> 01:26:32.333
to getting charged
with something?


993
01:26:32.402 --> 01:26:33.369
That would have certainly taken

994
01:26:33.438 --> 01:26:35.785
any scholarship off the table.

995
01:26:37.821 --> 01:26:38.788
Oh maybe that's plan?

996
01:26:39.961 --> 01:26:41.549
I have no idea who you
are right now,


997
01:26:41.618 --> 01:26:42.688
Ali would never do this.

998
01:26:42.757 --> 01:26:45.795
I'm so sick of you talking

999
01:26:45.864 --> 01:26:50.110
about this flawless version
of who you think I used to be.


1000
01:26:51.421 --> 01:26:53.009
Okay, that person's gone.

1001
01:26:53.906 --> 01:26:55.011
Not to me she's not.

1002
01:26:56.323 --> 01:26:57.807
Well then you're delusional.

1003
01:26:59.188 --> 01:27:00.189
Your father doesn't
think we should


1004
01:27:00.258 --> 01:27:02.605
let you come and go right
now by yourself.


1005
01:27:02.674 --> 01:27:04.848
Until we can trust you
with your own safety.


1006
01:27:06.574 --> 01:27:08.473
That's not gonna fix it.

1007
01:27:10.958 --> 01:27:15.652
Allison! Keys!

1008
01:27:24.420 --> 01:27:25.869
Thought we had a deal.

1009
01:27:25.938 --> 01:27:27.940
You weren't gonna give
me any more trouble.


1010
01:27:28.009 --> 01:27:30.011
Clearly I'm looking for
your attention.


1011
01:27:31.289 --> 01:27:32.566
Well, you've got it now.

1012
01:27:36.742 --> 01:27:37.778
Little bit late, Dad.

1013
01:27:41.575 --> 01:27:43.611
Hey... wait up.

1014
01:27:43.680 --> 01:27:47.028
You know, I've forgotten
what your smile looks like.


1015
01:27:48.098 --> 01:27:49.790
And you know it
sucks losing mom.


1016
01:27:49.859 --> 01:27:53.034
But it kills me to see
you wasting away inside.


1017
01:27:55.382 --> 01:27:56.176
Cam!

1018
01:27:58.005 --> 01:27:58.833
Cameron!

1019
01:28:25.446 --> 01:28:27.241
Ali, you awake?

1020
01:28:29.105 --> 01:28:29.933
Yeah.

1021
01:28:31.901 --> 01:28:32.729
Can I come in?

1022
01:28:33.903 --> 01:28:34.731
Sure.

1023
01:28:40.323 --> 01:28:42.291
Did she make you come over?

1024
01:28:42.360 --> 01:28:43.257
Wasn't her idea.

1025
01:28:45.673 --> 01:28:46.709
The Grove, huh?

1026
01:28:48.607 --> 01:28:49.367
I'm sorry.

1027
01:28:50.506 --> 01:28:51.679
You know, I
remember bringing you


1028
01:28:51.748 --> 01:28:53.923
home from the hospital
when you were a baby.


1029
01:28:56.097 --> 01:28:57.651
You fit in the crook of my arm.

1030
01:29:00.757 --> 01:29:02.518
We were terrified your
mother and I.


1031
01:29:04.520 --> 01:29:07.005
Always so worried we were
going to hug you too tightly


1032
01:29:07.074 --> 01:29:10.215
or drop you or...
when you slept,


1033
01:29:11.492 --> 01:29:12.700
we would sit beside your crib

1034
01:29:12.769 --> 01:29:15.669
for hours just listening
to you breathe.


1035
01:29:18.603 --> 01:29:21.640
Honey to see you know
with no genuine knowledge


1036
01:29:21.709 --> 01:29:23.884
of the love you come from...

1037
01:29:26.714 --> 01:29:28.268
it hurts to tell you the truth.

1038
01:29:30.925 --> 01:29:32.272
But that's not your problem,

1039
01:29:33.445 --> 01:29:35.447
you've got enough to
worry about.


1040
01:29:35.516 --> 01:29:38.726
What we worry about is
that at least


1041
01:29:38.795 --> 01:29:40.314
you're going to be okay.

1042
01:29:42.730 --> 01:29:43.938
What if I'm not though?

1043
01:29:46.665 --> 01:29:51.118
Like what if this is as
good as it's gonna get.


1044
01:29:52.602 --> 01:29:57.538
Sweetheart, you happy is
the only thing we care about.


1045
01:30:04.925 --> 01:30:07.997
If you really mean that, then

1046
01:30:08.066 --> 01:30:10.586
there's something I'd
like to show you.


1047
01:30:21.459 --> 01:30:26.084
I was having doubts
before the accident.


1048
01:30:27.775 --> 01:30:29.018
About a lot of things

1049
01:30:29.087 --> 01:30:34.092
and... I don't think I felt
I could talk to you guys


1050
01:30:34.161 --> 01:30:38.510
about it 'cause I was afraid
that I'd disappoint you or...


1051
01:30:39.580 --> 01:30:40.685
I don't know.

1052
01:30:40.754 --> 01:30:45.068
But... I'm hoping that maybe

1053
01:30:45.137 --> 01:30:46.725
we could figure it out together.

1054
01:30:49.487 --> 01:30:50.419
Yeah.

1055
01:30:50.488 --> 01:30:51.316
You bet.

1056
01:31:06.952 --> 01:31:08.437
Hey, she doesn't know
who she is asshole,


1057
01:31:08.506 --> 01:31:09.265
don't you get that?

1058
01:31:09.334 --> 01:31:10.128
- Back off, dude.
- Ethan!


1059
01:31:10.197 --> 01:31:10.956
Knock it off.

1060
01:31:11.025 --> 01:31:12.130
The Grove, Cam?

1061
01:31:12.199 --> 01:31:12.958
Told you to leave her
out of your shit!


1062
01:31:13.027 --> 01:31:13.821
Ethan!

1063
01:31:13.890 --> 01:31:15.685
Stop. Get inside.

1064
01:31:15.754 --> 01:31:17.100
Ethan, stay right there.

1065
01:31:17.169 --> 01:31:20.414
Hey. Cam. Are you okay?

1066
01:31:20.483 --> 01:31:21.242
Cameron, you okay?

1067
01:31:21.311 --> 01:31:22.071
Yeah.

1068
01:31:22.140 --> 01:31:23.141
No, stay down.

1069
01:31:23.210 --> 01:31:25.177
I'm fine. I'm fine. I'm fine.

1070
01:31:25.246 --> 01:31:27.179
Cam, you're bleeding.

1071
01:31:47.510 --> 01:31:50.306
Pretty sure you're not the
tutor they're sending over.


1072
01:31:50.375 --> 01:31:52.101
If I am, you're in trouble.

1073
01:31:53.827 --> 01:31:54.621
More trouble.

1074
01:31:57.278 --> 01:31:58.659
Heard you got suspended.

1075
01:32:01.075 --> 01:32:02.422
Yeah, it was stupid, Ali.

1076
01:32:04.285 --> 01:32:05.114
Yeah.

1077
01:32:07.496 --> 01:32:11.016
Look, Ethan, this has to stop.

1078
01:32:11.914 --> 01:32:13.053
Okay, it's over.

1079
01:32:19.646 --> 01:32:22.269
And I feel like it has been,
for awhile.


1080
01:32:23.512 --> 01:32:24.340
Hasn't it?

1081
01:32:26.135 --> 01:32:26.963
Yeah.

1082
01:32:30.415 --> 01:32:31.312
The accident.

1083
01:32:32.555 --> 01:32:33.901
We were arguing in the car.

1084
01:32:35.282 --> 01:32:37.387
You were saying you
needed to make changes.


1085
01:32:40.045 --> 01:32:41.461
You were breaking up with me.

1086
01:32:44.429 --> 01:32:45.913
I was driving really fast.

1087
01:32:47.225 --> 01:32:48.433
Proving all your points.

1088
01:32:50.470 --> 01:32:52.299
I don't know, if I had it
together, maybe I'd have


1089
01:32:52.368 --> 01:32:53.680
seen the car coming sooner.

1090
01:32:56.924 --> 01:32:57.718
Avoided it.

1091
01:33:00.238 --> 01:33:01.377
Avoided all this.

1092
01:33:07.452 --> 01:33:09.005
I'm sorry that I hurt you, Ali.

1093
01:33:12.250 --> 01:33:14.701
I'm sorry that I'm the
reason your old life is gone.


1094
01:33:15.840 --> 01:33:17.842
Hey, it's not all on you,
okay?


1095
01:33:21.673 --> 01:33:22.985
I played a part too.

1096
01:33:26.644 --> 01:33:30.510
But... maybe it's for the best.

1097
01:33:33.927 --> 01:33:34.686
Yeah.

1098
01:33:52.566 --> 01:33:55.638
Thought your parents
had you on lock-down.


1099
01:33:55.707 --> 01:33:56.466
Snuck out.

1100
01:33:57.813 --> 01:34:00.298
You're heading down a
dark path, Ali Spencer.


1101
01:34:02.576 --> 01:34:04.405
I'm sorry you're back here.

1102
01:34:04.474 --> 01:34:05.821
Actually, it's okay.
I'm seriously


1103
01:34:05.890 --> 01:34:07.719
thinking about a career with
the Town Parks Department.


1104
01:34:07.788 --> 01:34:09.341
- Oh yeah?
- Hm. Hmm.


1105
01:34:09.410 --> 01:34:10.515
Yeah, nice try.

1106
01:34:11.999 --> 01:34:13.691
I feel horrible about Ethan.

1107
01:34:14.899 --> 01:34:16.383
Well, maybe I had it coming.

1108
01:34:16.452 --> 01:34:18.005
No, no way.

1109
01:34:18.074 --> 01:34:20.421
That was all him.

1110
01:34:20.490 --> 01:34:22.182
Still... we should chill.

1111
01:34:23.321 --> 01:34:26.669
At least until you get it
all figured out.


1112
01:34:26.738 --> 01:34:29.707
Come on, we don't have
to let things get awkward


1113
01:34:29.776 --> 01:34:31.709
between us.

1114
01:34:33.124 --> 01:34:35.644
Did you get your bike back?

1115
01:34:35.713 --> 01:34:37.059
Nah.

1116
01:34:41.615 --> 01:34:44.100
Look, I really gotta
get back to this.


1117
01:34:44.169 --> 01:34:46.862
Okay. I'll see you around?

1118
01:34:46.931 --> 01:34:48.242
Definitely.

1119
01:34:58.977 --> 01:35:01.393
I'm sure it wasn't
easy to talk


1120
01:35:01.462 --> 01:35:04.707
about certain things with
you or with anyone really.


1121
01:35:06.295 --> 01:35:07.676
No, I get it.

1122
01:35:07.745 --> 01:35:10.299
I know you guys are
really important to me.


1123
01:35:10.368 --> 01:35:13.440
And I truly appreciate you.

1124
01:35:14.614 --> 01:35:17.962
I just think it's gonna
take some time


1125
01:35:18.031 --> 01:35:19.998
to get to where I need to be,
you know?


1126
01:35:21.897 --> 01:35:25.486
So I'm sorry if I seem a
little distant.


1127
01:35:25.555 --> 01:35:28.628
Or if I try some shit that
seems a little out there.


1128
01:35:33.978 --> 01:35:36.014
So what's the deal
with Cameron?


1129
01:35:37.050 --> 01:35:39.362
He just seems to get me.

1130
01:35:41.295 --> 01:35:44.091
I know this sounds stupid
but we just kind of connect.


1131
01:35:44.160 --> 01:35:45.403
You know?

1132
01:35:45.472 --> 01:35:47.129
That's not stupid.

1133
01:35:48.440 --> 01:35:50.201
That's nice, I'm glad
you have that.


1134
01:35:51.409 --> 01:35:53.963
I just... I really want
you to be happy.


1135
01:35:55.620 --> 01:35:57.657
I know. I see it.

1136
01:36:00.280 --> 01:36:03.490
Thanks for showing me
this. It means a lot.


1137
01:36:09.841 --> 01:36:12.810
How much did they hit you
up to get it out of impound?


1138
01:36:13.776 --> 01:36:15.571
Every cent I had.

1139
01:36:15.640 --> 01:36:17.366
Probably more than it's worth.

1140
01:36:17.435 --> 01:36:18.850
Yeah, maybe.

1141
01:36:22.129 --> 01:36:23.337
How bad is it?

1142
01:36:25.823 --> 01:36:27.065
Won't pass inspection.

1143
01:36:31.518 --> 01:36:34.072
Do you have any idea
what you're doing?


1144
01:36:34.970 --> 01:36:36.557
Yeah, I saw a video.

1145
01:36:45.497 --> 01:36:48.052
What are you trying to do?

1146
01:36:48.121 --> 01:36:50.433
Trying to take the tire off
so I can switch the brakes.


1147
01:36:50.502 --> 01:36:54.368
Okay, let me uh... show
you a trick my dad taught me.


1148
01:37:05.241 --> 01:37:07.554
Go ahead, take the
brake assembly off.


1149
01:37:08.589 --> 01:37:09.418
Okay.

1150
01:37:11.489 --> 01:37:14.285
Yeah, now we're
cooking with gas.


1151
01:37:19.255 --> 01:37:20.084
Okay.

1152
01:37:21.741 --> 01:37:24.571
See here, you take this.

1153
01:37:24.640 --> 01:37:26.262
Small steps.

1154
01:37:27.539 --> 01:37:30.680
Small. Small.

1155
01:37:32.855 --> 01:37:35.720
Small steps...

1156
01:37:38.274 --> 01:37:42.554
And with each passing day
she becomes more victorious.


1157
01:37:44.039 --> 01:37:47.007
So many small steps
yet to be taken.


1158
01:37:48.112 --> 01:37:50.286
But every day is new.

1159
01:37:52.357 --> 01:37:54.014
Every day is possible.

1160
01:37:56.534 --> 01:38:01.470
And one day she will
rise... like the sun...


1161
01:38:02.851 --> 01:38:07.717
beautiful... different...

1162
01:38:08.615 --> 01:38:11.100
Fully alive.

1163
01:38:46.342 --> 01:38:49.483
License and
registration please.


1164
01:38:50.760 --> 01:38:51.969
Just passed inspection.

1165
01:38:53.039 --> 01:38:54.592
She's completely legal.

1166
01:38:54.661 --> 01:38:55.627
Congratulations.

1167
01:38:56.697 --> 01:38:58.803
So, I heard you're
coming back.


1168
01:38:58.872 --> 01:38:59.700
Next week.

1169
01:39:01.254 --> 01:39:04.844
So back on track with
the scholarship?


1170
01:39:06.673 --> 01:39:09.883
Actually, all that's on hold,
for now.


1171
01:39:14.301 --> 01:39:15.613
Well, I'll let you to it.

1172
01:39:17.511 --> 01:39:18.340
Hang on.

1173
01:39:20.790 --> 01:39:23.069
I'm just want you to
know that I'm done


1174
01:39:23.138 --> 01:39:25.347
hoping my memory comes back.

1175
01:39:26.658 --> 01:39:30.283
Trying to solve the
mystery of who I was.


1176
01:39:32.595 --> 01:39:35.771
I'm just creating my
own memories now,


1177
01:39:35.840 --> 01:39:38.360
and whatever happens
happens with the old ones.


1178
01:39:39.809 --> 01:39:44.297
But I'm gonna create a
pretty big memory on Saturday


1179
01:39:44.366 --> 01:39:47.472
and I'd really like
you to be there for it.


1180
01:39:47.541 --> 01:39:48.888
Okay.

1181
01:39:48.957 --> 01:39:51.028
I'll text you the details.

1182
01:39:51.097 --> 01:39:52.512
I think you'll like it.

1183
01:39:53.823 --> 01:39:55.239
I hope you will.

1184
01:40:02.280 --> 01:40:06.043
Cam, I meant what I said.

1185
01:40:08.217 --> 01:40:11.324
If you ever need someone to
help you un-crowd that brain,


1186
01:40:12.428 --> 01:40:13.602
I'm here...

1187
01:40:15.776 --> 01:40:16.812
Cool.

1188
01:40:32.690 --> 01:40:35.969
I'm Ali Spencer, so
they told me.


1189
01:40:37.591 --> 01:40:40.594
Uh... a while ago I got into
a pretty bad car accident


1190
01:40:40.663 --> 01:40:42.872
and my long term memory is
totally swiped.


1191
01:40:44.150 --> 01:40:46.911
It could be temporary but
it could be permanent.


1192
01:40:48.016 --> 01:40:50.673
And I still don't know
everything about


1193
01:40:50.742 --> 01:40:52.917
who Ali Spencer really
was but I'm not


1194
01:40:52.986 --> 01:40:54.125
freaking out about it.

1195
01:40:54.194 --> 01:40:56.956
I'm just moving forward
and trying to find


1196
01:40:57.025 --> 01:40:59.751
out who I am now.

1197
01:40:59.820 --> 01:41:01.581
And so, this is a poem
about all that.


1198
01:41:01.650 --> 01:41:04.135
It's about a girl who
lost herself


1199
01:41:04.204 --> 01:41:08.001
and maybe she never will
find the person she once was.


1200
01:41:08.070 --> 01:41:11.211
But maybe she will find the
one she's suppose to be.


1201
01:41:13.627 --> 01:41:15.802
It's called "The Mystery
of My History"


1202
01:41:15.871 --> 01:41:19.047
and I'd like to dedicated
it to my friend, Cameron.


1203
01:41:20.980 --> 01:41:23.465
It's easy to love the light...

1204
01:41:23.534 --> 01:41:26.882
and what can be seen
in plain sight.


1205
01:41:26.951 --> 01:41:28.815
It's much harder to
embrace the dark,


1206
01:41:28.884 --> 01:41:30.920
no idea if you'll ever
hit your mark.


1207
01:41:32.025 --> 01:41:33.544
You claim that the past is known

1208
01:41:33.613 --> 01:41:35.028
and the future can't be seen,

1209
01:41:35.097 --> 01:41:38.342
but I say history is a mystery

1210
01:41:39.515 --> 01:41:42.380
and the future is where
we come clean...


1211
01:41:48.628 --> 01:41:50.975
It's easy to love the light...

1212
01:41:51.044 --> 01:41:52.356
And what can be...

1213
01:42:26.631 --> 01:42:29.496
Dear Future Me... I
know sometimes


1214
01:42:29.565 --> 01:42:33.017
you're probably feeling
like things are overwhelming


1215
01:42:33.086 --> 01:42:36.814
but I've got great news for you.

1216
01:42:36.883 --> 01:42:38.747
Have faith.

1217
01:42:38.816 --> 01:42:41.922
Just remember, you are
capable of so much more


1218
01:42:41.991 --> 01:42:44.511
than you even realize.

1219
01:42:44.580 --> 01:42:47.169
Take the risks you're
afraid of taking,


1220
01:42:47.238 --> 01:42:50.414
paint your picture boldly
across the universe.


1221
01:42:51.277 --> 01:42:54.659
But most of all, love.

1222
01:42:54.728 --> 01:42:58.007
Love exactly who you are,

1223
01:42:58.077 --> 01:43:00.734
an amazing future is
awaiting you.


1224
01:43:01.040 --> 01:43:04.219
