and is suitable for

♪ ♪

4
00:03:34.814 --> 00:03:35.747
Where are the cupcakes?

5
00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:36.913
The cupcakes aren't out yet!

6
00:03:37.046 --> 00:03:38.480
Where do you want
the champagne, honey?


7
00:03:38.614 --> 00:03:40.413
How about over there?
Thanks, Mom.


8
00:03:40.547 --> 00:03:41.580
Got the cupcakes!

9
00:03:41.714 --> 00:03:42.714
Fabulous! Let me see...

10
00:03:43.714 --> 00:03:44.946
Actually...

11
00:03:46.913 --> 00:03:48.280
There, perfect.

12
00:03:48.413 --> 00:03:49.313
Better.

13
00:03:49.447 --> 00:03:50.413
Sorry...

14
00:03:50.547 --> 00:03:51.714
It's a good thing
you caught that,


15
00:03:51.847 --> 00:03:54.213
otherwise the party
would have been ruined.


16
00:03:56.614 --> 00:03:59.213
Relax honey,
it's going to be great!


17
00:03:59.347 --> 00:04:01.580
I just want everything
to be perfect, mom.


18
00:04:01.714 --> 00:04:02.747
There's a reporter coming!

19
00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:03.680
She's right.

20
00:04:03.814 --> 00:04:05.847
We need to put our
best foot forward.


21
00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:08.213
We're announcing the launch
of our wedding cakes today.


22
00:04:08.347 --> 00:04:10.647
I still can't believe you
got her to do weddings, Howard.


23
00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:13.747
I'm not quite sure
how that happened, either.


24
00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:15.847
Weddings are big business!

25
00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:17.614
We've gotta give them
what they want.


26
00:04:17.747 --> 00:04:19.247
That's why I hired him.

27
00:04:24.614 --> 00:04:25.447
Okay...

28
00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:42.714
It's the 65th anniversary
of Providence's own


29
00:04:42.847 --> 00:04:44.280
Miriam's Sweet
Treats bakery,


30
00:04:44.413 --> 00:04:46.814
and I'm here with owner
and head baker, Jessie Dale.


31
00:04:46.946 --> 00:04:48.413
So Jessie, you
inherited the shop


32
00:04:48.547 --> 00:04:50.347
from your grandmother,
Miriam, is that right?


33
00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:52.313
I did, about five years ago.

34
00:04:52.447 --> 00:04:53.880
She taught me everything I know.

35
00:04:54.013 --> 00:04:55.714
Sounds like a
very special lady.


36
00:04:55.847 --> 00:04:57.480
She was my best friend.

37
00:04:57.614 --> 00:04:58.847
Do you want to
give us a tour?


38
00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:00.747
Sure, follow me.

39
00:05:06.714 --> 00:05:09.814
So this is my grandmother
teaching me how to bake.


40
00:05:09.946 --> 00:05:10.946
Grandma's apron.

41
00:05:11.946 --> 00:05:14.880
And that's a photo
from opening day, 1955,


42
00:05:15.013 --> 00:05:16.880
when grandma opened
Miriam's Sweet Treats.


43
00:05:17.013 --> 00:05:18.747
She was about the same age
as me there.


44
00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:21.380
Oh, and that's the very first
bowl and spoon


45
00:05:21.513 --> 00:05:22.814
my grandmother ever used,

46
00:05:22.946 --> 00:05:25.380
which she inherited from
her grandmother, Florrie!


47
00:05:25.513 --> 00:05:27.313
Baking runs in
the family, it seems.


48
00:05:27.447 --> 00:05:28.980
Do you have any plans
on changing the bakery,


49
00:05:29.113 --> 00:05:30.046
now that it's yours?

50
00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:31.046
No.

51
00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:33.814
Our history is very much
a part of our story,


52
00:05:33.946 --> 00:05:35.847
and we're proud of
the fact that our bakery


53
00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:38.580
has remained unchanged
for 65 years.


54
00:05:38.714 --> 00:05:43.980
Of course, we're always
looking for ways to expand.


55
00:05:44.113 --> 00:05:46.313
Have you told them
about the wedding cakes?


56
00:05:46.447 --> 00:05:47.814
Thank you, Howard.

57
00:05:47.946 --> 00:05:49.447
Yes, actually.

58
00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:50.946
Due to popular demand,

59
00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:53.447
we now do custom wedding cakes!

60
00:05:54.747 --> 00:05:57.280
Available for pre-order now!

61
00:05:57.413 --> 00:05:58.580
Shall we do a taste test?

62
00:05:58.714 --> 00:06:00.614
Yes, let's do a taste test.

63
00:06:05.614 --> 00:06:06.447
Mmm!

64
00:06:07.814 --> 00:06:09.513
This is amazing.

65
00:06:11.046 --> 00:06:12.380
It's really good.

66
00:06:14.146 --> 00:06:15.547
Miriam's Sweet Treats,
everybody.


67
00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:17.880
The best little bakery
in Rhode Island.


68
00:06:18.913 --> 00:06:20.013
Sam, you've gotta try this.

69
00:06:20.146 --> 00:06:21.513
It's so good.

70
00:06:27.747 --> 00:06:30.480
I don't think there's a
single slice of cake left


71
00:06:30.614 --> 00:06:31.847
in this entire place.

72
00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:34.380
Now that's the sign
of a good party.


73
00:06:34.513 --> 00:06:35.480
(phone beeps)

74
00:06:35.614 --> 00:06:38.614
We've already had a ton
of wedding inquiries.


75
00:06:38.747 --> 00:06:41.614
And the segment doesn't
even air until tomorrow.


76
00:06:42.614 --> 00:06:43.946
You guys should go home.

77
00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:45.380
I'll clean up.

78
00:06:46.847 --> 00:06:47.714
You sure?

79
00:06:47.847 --> 00:06:49.647
Don't have to ask me twice.

80
00:06:49.780 --> 00:06:50.680
Good night!

81
00:06:50.814 --> 00:06:52.380
I'm sure. Thanks, Howard.

82
00:06:52.513 --> 00:06:53.447
I'll see you tomorrow.

83
00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:54.413
Okay.

84
00:06:56.580 --> 00:06:59.480
Mom, you've done so much.
Go home.


85
00:07:00.714 --> 00:07:03.814
Your grandmother
would be so proud of you.


86
00:07:03.946 --> 00:07:05.180
Really.

87
00:07:05.313 --> 00:07:06.747
Thanks, Mom.

88
00:07:08.313 --> 00:07:10.647
I really wish she
would have been here.


89
00:07:11.814 --> 00:07:13.013
Me too.

90
00:07:23.113 --> 00:07:24.747
There.

91
00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:26.513
What do you think?

92
00:07:26.647 --> 00:07:27.847
It's nice!

93
00:07:27.980 --> 00:07:28.980
You hate it.

94
00:07:29.113 --> 00:07:30.413
I don't hate it!

95
00:07:30.547 --> 00:07:31.647
I know what
"it's nice" means.


96
00:07:31.780 --> 00:07:32.847
It means you hate it.

97
00:07:32.980 --> 00:07:34.080
I don't hate it.

98
00:07:34.213 --> 00:07:35.780
I would just...

99
00:07:38.946 --> 00:07:39.880
Like that.

100
00:07:40.013 --> 00:07:41.614
I don't see a difference!

101
00:07:41.747 --> 00:07:42.847
Am I going insane?

102
00:07:42.980 --> 00:07:43.847
Am I living in the sim?

103
00:07:43.980 --> 00:07:45.146
What did you even do?

104
00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:46.413
Good morning!

105
00:07:46.547 --> 00:07:47.113
Morning, Howard.

106
00:07:47.247 --> 00:07:48.614
You're in a good mood!

107
00:07:48.747 --> 00:07:51.046
You're about to be, too.

108
00:07:51.180 --> 00:07:52.946
I just landed us
the biggest opportunity


109
00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:54.747
this bakery's ever had.

110
00:07:54.880 --> 00:07:56.747
Oh no, what did you do?

111
00:07:56.880 --> 00:08:01.146
Belson's wants to carry
your cakes in their stores.


112
00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:02.747
Belson's, like
the grocery chain?


113
00:08:02.880 --> 00:08:03.880
That's the one.

114
00:08:04.880 --> 00:08:06.814
What? No, absolutely not.

115
00:08:06.946 --> 00:08:07.913
Are you crazy?

116
00:08:08.046 --> 00:08:09.046
Jessie, this is huge...

117
00:08:09.180 --> 00:08:10.213
And corporate.

118
00:08:10.347 --> 00:08:11.313
And impersonal.

119
00:08:11.447 --> 00:08:13.714
My grandmother would never
have gone for this.


120
00:08:13.847 --> 00:08:15.146
We make our cakes fresh.

121
00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:16.880
We're not an assembly line.

122
00:08:17.013 --> 00:08:18.247
They would still be fresh!

123
00:08:18.380 --> 00:08:20.680
We would set our own terms.

124
00:08:20.814 --> 00:08:21.780
No...

125
00:08:21.913 --> 00:08:22.814
Sorry, Howard.

126
00:08:31.247 --> 00:08:33.146
We need this, Jessie.

127
00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:35.046
We'll find another way.

128
00:08:37.714 --> 00:08:38.946
Why did you hire me?

129
00:08:39.080 --> 00:08:41.247
To take over the books from Mom,

130
00:08:41.380 --> 00:08:44.714
and to help us find ways
to keep this place...


131
00:08:44.847 --> 00:08:46.113
Afloat?

132
00:08:46.247 --> 00:08:47.180
Afloat.

133
00:08:47.313 --> 00:08:49.847
Look, it's not 1955 anymore.

134
00:08:50.847 --> 00:08:52.680
Rent is increasing every year.

135
00:08:52.814 --> 00:08:54.080
The cost of living is going up.

136
00:08:54.213 --> 00:08:56.280
Our suppliers keep
raising their prices.


137
00:08:57.814 --> 00:08:59.780
If you can't find
a way to keep up,


138
00:08:59.980 --> 00:09:02.780
you won't have
a bakery at all.


139
00:09:02.913 --> 00:09:04.113
I know...

140
00:09:04.247 --> 00:09:04.980
I know!

141
00:09:05.113 --> 00:09:06.647
You're right.

142
00:09:06.780 --> 00:09:08.847
But Belson's would
be a huge change,


143
00:09:08.980 --> 00:09:12.780
and I just don't want this place
to turn into something it's not.


144
00:09:12.913 --> 00:09:14.313
I already agreed
to do wedding cakes.


145
00:09:14.447 --> 00:09:16.714
Can we just see
how that goes first?


146
00:09:18.013 --> 00:09:18.913
Fine.

147
00:09:19.880 --> 00:09:21.647
But this deal won't
be on the table forever.


148
00:09:21.780 --> 00:09:22.614
I know.

149
00:09:24.247 --> 00:09:25.247
The segment's on!

150
00:09:25.380 --> 00:09:27.847
I'm here with owner and
head baker, Jessie Dale.


151
00:09:27.980 --> 00:09:29.213
So Jessie, you
inherited the shop


152
00:09:29.347 --> 00:09:31.046
from your grandmother,
Miriam, is that right?


153
00:09:31.180 --> 00:09:32.980
I did, about five years ago.

154
00:09:33.113 --> 00:09:34.780
She taught me everything I kno.

155
00:09:34.913 --> 00:09:36.580
Sounds like a
very special lady.


156
00:09:36.714 --> 00:09:38.213
She was my best friend.

157
00:09:39.113 --> 00:09:40.647
Do you want to give us a tour?

158
00:09:40.780 --> 00:09:41.647
Sure.

159
00:09:53.080 --> 00:09:54.547
I don't care that the designs

160
00:09:54.680 --> 00:09:55.847
have been through
production already,


161
00:09:55.980 --> 00:09:58.313
I don't want them
in my new line.


162
00:09:59.714 --> 00:10:01.814
We'll unload them
at a sample sale.


163
00:10:03.080 --> 00:10:04.614
Yes, thank you darling.

164
00:10:05.413 --> 00:10:07.046
I'll be in later today.

165
00:10:11.313 --> 00:10:13.113
[TV on in background]

166
00:10:17.213 --> 00:10:18.747
Miriam's Sweet Treats,
everybody.


167
00:10:18.880 --> 00:10:20.780
The best little bakery
in Rhode Island.


168
00:10:23.247 --> 00:10:26.213
Hmm, Miriam's Sweet Treats?

169
00:10:30.113 --> 00:10:31.647
(phone dialling)

170
00:10:34.913 --> 00:10:36.614
Okay, sounds great.

171
00:10:36.747 --> 00:10:39.180
Thank you so much,
we'll see you soon.


172
00:10:43.213 --> 00:10:45.180
You guys will never guess
who that was.


173
00:10:45.313 --> 00:10:46.113
Who?

174
00:10:46.247 --> 00:10:47.313
Suzanne Cooper.

175
00:10:48.247 --> 00:10:49.980
The fashion designer?

176
00:10:50.113 --> 00:10:51.146
[Howard]
Are you kidding me?


177
00:10:51.280 --> 00:10:53.247
She's like, the most
famous person in Rhode Island!


178
00:10:53.380 --> 00:10:55.614
She wants us to do
her wedding cake.


179
00:10:55.747 --> 00:10:56.680
Are you serious?

180
00:10:56.814 --> 00:10:58.280
Oh my gosh,
I love her clothes.


181
00:10:58.413 --> 00:10:59.046
Oh my gosh!

182
00:10:59.180 --> 00:11:01.046
-This is incredible.
-I know!


183
00:11:01.180 --> 00:11:03.714
This could open us up to a whole
new world of elite clients!


184
00:11:03.847 --> 00:11:05.313
Maybe she'll give us
an in-store discount!


185
00:11:05.447 --> 00:11:07.313
I don't know,
what if she's snobby?


186
00:11:07.447 --> 00:11:08.280
Or demanding?

187
00:11:08.413 --> 00:11:09.380
Oh, she will be.

188
00:11:09.513 --> 00:11:11.113
For sure, no doubt.

189
00:11:11.247 --> 00:11:12.913
But this is excellent news.

190
00:11:13.046 --> 00:11:14.814
This is excellent news!

191
00:11:14.946 --> 00:11:16.146
When is she coming in?

192
00:11:17.146 --> 00:11:18.180
Now-ish...

193
00:11:18.313 --> 00:11:19.347
Now-ish?

194
00:11:30.247 --> 00:11:32.614
Tell me why I'm here again?

195
00:11:32.747 --> 00:11:34.213
Evan can't make it.

196
00:11:34.347 --> 00:11:35.980
And I need a
male perspective.


197
00:11:36.980 --> 00:11:39.247
A male perspective on cake?

198
00:11:39.380 --> 00:11:40.980
Exactly.

199
00:11:41.113 --> 00:11:44.046
Well, is my male perspective
actually going to influence


200
00:11:44.180 --> 00:11:45.714
your decision in any way?

201
00:11:47.013 --> 00:11:48.714
Probably not.

202
00:11:48.847 --> 00:11:50.247
Good.

203
00:11:50.380 --> 00:11:52.046
I'm glad that's clear.

204
00:11:52.180 --> 00:11:54.280
I love cake!

205
00:11:54.413 --> 00:11:55.880
Cake, cake, cake!

206
00:11:56.013 --> 00:11:58.213
I love cake too, Riley.

207
00:11:58.347 --> 00:12:01.247
And I love your enthusiasm!

208
00:12:01.380 --> 00:12:04.480
You know, you could learn
a thing or two from her.


209
00:12:22.413 --> 00:12:23.747
She's here!

210
00:12:24.547 --> 00:12:25.714
Does everything look okay?

211
00:12:25.847 --> 00:12:26.647
How does everything look?

212
00:12:26.780 --> 00:12:28.013
-Do I look okay?
-Would you guys relax?


213
00:12:28.146 --> 00:12:29.747
She's just a person!

214
00:12:29.880 --> 00:12:32.180
She's not a person,
she's an angel.


215
00:12:32.313 --> 00:12:33.313
An icon!

216
00:12:33.447 --> 00:12:35.347
With the ability to put us
in the national spotlight.


217
00:12:35.480 --> 00:12:36.747
Yeah, so don't mess this up.

218
00:12:36.880 --> 00:12:38.347
Mess up and we're done.

219
00:12:38.480 --> 00:12:39.980
No pressure.

220
00:12:40.113 --> 00:12:41.213
Thank you...

221
00:12:42.180 --> 00:12:43.413
Welcome to
Miriam's Sweet Treats.


222
00:12:43.547 --> 00:12:44.447
How can I help you today?

223
00:12:44.580 --> 00:12:46.780
I'm Suzanne Cooper,
we spoke on the phone.


224
00:12:46.913 --> 00:12:49.247
Oh yes of course,
so nice to meet you.


225
00:12:49.380 --> 00:12:50.280
And you must be Evan.

226
00:12:50.413 --> 00:12:52.280
Congratulations on your big day.

227
00:12:52.413 --> 00:12:54.946
Actually I'm Aidan,
the brother.


228
00:12:55.080 --> 00:12:56.280
Oh.

229
00:12:56.413 --> 00:12:58.113
Well, welcome.

230
00:12:58.247 --> 00:12:59.780
Evan's in surgery today.

231
00:12:59.980 --> 00:13:01.814
And pretty much every day.

232
00:13:02.913 --> 00:13:04.780
And who is this little cutie?

233
00:13:04.913 --> 00:13:06.480
This is our
official cake tester.


234
00:13:06.614 --> 00:13:07.946
She's an expert.

235
00:13:08.080 --> 00:13:09.347
Oh, really?

236
00:13:10.547 --> 00:13:11.946
Riley, my daughter.

237
00:13:12.080 --> 00:13:13.280
Nice to meet you, Riley.

238
00:13:13.413 --> 00:13:15.080
Would you like a tour
of the kitchen?


239
00:13:15.213 --> 00:13:16.146
Okay.

240
00:13:17.180 --> 00:13:18.280
Beatrice, do you mind?

241
00:13:19.380 --> 00:13:21.913
Are you sure you
don't need my help out here?


242
00:13:22.046 --> 00:13:23.380
I'm sure, thank you.

243
00:13:25.113 --> 00:13:26.447
Well there you go!

244
00:13:28.080 --> 00:13:29.380
Don't break anything.

245
00:13:31.447 --> 00:13:33.480
So, shall we eat some cake?

246
00:13:33.614 --> 00:13:36.013
Why yes, that's
what we're here for.


247
00:13:43.146 --> 00:13:44.080
Hi.

248
00:13:49.513 --> 00:13:50.580
This is delicious.

249
00:13:50.714 --> 00:13:52.480
I might have to get married
again just to hire you.


250
00:13:52.614 --> 00:13:54.080
Luckily I'm a firm believer

251
00:13:54.213 --> 00:13:56.347
that any occasion is
an occasion for cake.


252
00:13:56.480 --> 00:13:57.380
Well...

253
00:13:58.313 --> 00:14:00.046
I love all of them.

254
00:14:00.180 --> 00:14:01.413
You're hired.

255
00:14:01.547 --> 00:14:03.013
You are so hired.

256
00:14:04.046 --> 00:14:04.880
Excellent!

257
00:14:05.013 --> 00:14:06.980
I will draw up the paperwork!

258
00:14:07.113 --> 00:14:10.413
Thank you! I so look forward
to working with you.


259
00:14:10.547 --> 00:14:11.347
I do too.

260
00:14:11.480 --> 00:14:12.847
Dad, look what I got!

261
00:14:12.980 --> 00:14:14.180
Can I take it home?

262
00:14:14.313 --> 00:14:15.547
I think you've got
to leave that here.


263
00:14:15.680 --> 00:14:16.980
Dad...

264
00:14:17.113 --> 00:14:18.213
Sorry, sweetie.

265
00:14:18.347 --> 00:14:19.480
You can try some cake, though.

266
00:14:19.614 --> 00:14:21.146
Ooh, chocolate.

267
00:14:26.547 --> 00:14:28.280
Okay, coming in...

268
00:14:30.380 --> 00:14:33.146
Yum, can you get some chocolate,
Aunt Suzanne?


269
00:14:33.280 --> 00:14:35.113
I love four berry,
sorry Riley.


270
00:14:35.247 --> 00:14:37.146
But chocolate is my favorite.

271
00:14:37.280 --> 00:14:38.580
I know, kiddo.

272
00:14:38.714 --> 00:14:40.580
You can have a chocolate cake
at your wedding.


273
00:14:40.714 --> 00:14:42.380
Sorry, bride's choice.

274
00:14:42.513 --> 00:14:44.480
Okay...

275
00:14:44.614 --> 00:14:45.347
You know what, Riley?

276
00:14:45.480 --> 00:14:46.980
Why don't you keep
that rolling pin?


277
00:14:47.113 --> 00:14:48.380
We have plenty.

278
00:14:48.513 --> 00:14:49.347
Really?

279
00:14:49.480 --> 00:14:50.480
Here you go.

280
00:14:52.946 --> 00:14:54.247
Thank you...

281
00:14:54.380 --> 00:14:55.580
You don't have
to give it to her.


282
00:14:55.714 --> 00:14:57.180
It's fine.

283
00:14:58.146 --> 00:14:59.013
You should keep it.

284
00:14:59.146 --> 00:15:01.547
I can tell there's
an inner baker in there.


285
00:15:01.680 --> 00:15:03.013
Please, Dad?

286
00:15:03.146 --> 00:15:04.247
Okay.

287
00:15:04.380 --> 00:15:05.180
What do we say?

288
00:15:05.313 --> 00:15:07.247
Thank you!

289
00:15:09.380 --> 00:15:10.447
Thank you, seriously.

290
00:15:10.580 --> 00:15:11.614
It's no problem.

291
00:15:14.447 --> 00:15:16.913
Well, we should
really get going.


292
00:15:17.046 --> 00:15:19.013
Jessie, why don't you
come to my house this week


293
00:15:19.146 --> 00:15:20.413
and you can look
at my wedding plans?


294
00:15:20.547 --> 00:15:22.413
You can see the look
I'm going for.


295
00:15:22.547 --> 00:15:24.146
Get a little inspiration.

296
00:15:24.280 --> 00:15:25.180
Sounds perfect.

297
00:15:25.313 --> 00:15:26.347
Tomorrow? Noon?

298
00:15:27.247 --> 00:15:28.946
I'll send you the address.

299
00:15:29.080 --> 00:15:30.213
I look forward to it.

300
00:15:30.347 --> 00:15:32.480
And I look forward
to working with you.


301
00:15:32.614 --> 00:15:33.647
Me too.

302
00:15:33.780 --> 00:15:35.413
Thanks, Jessie!

303
00:15:35.547 --> 00:15:37.447
You're welcome, Riley!

304
00:15:37.580 --> 00:15:38.647
It was nice to meet you.

305
00:15:38.780 --> 00:15:40.080
You too.

306
00:15:42.313 --> 00:15:43.580
All right, come on you
little munchkin!


307
00:15:43.714 --> 00:15:45.013
Here we go.

308
00:15:46.046 --> 00:15:48.480
Are we going to
the thrift store?


309
00:15:48.614 --> 00:15:50.280
(laughing)

310
00:15:51.313 --> 00:15:52.880
-Thanks again.
-Bye.


311
00:15:53.013 --> 00:15:54.647
Come on you, let's go
do some rolling.


312
00:15:54.780 --> 00:15:57.513
Well, looks like we're
doing our first wedding cake.


313
00:15:57.647 --> 00:16:00.980
She was incredible...

314
00:16:01.113 --> 00:16:02.280
I'm going to go write
a press release.


315
00:16:02.413 --> 00:16:03.413
What?

316
00:16:03.547 --> 00:16:05.347
Where are you even going
to release that?


317
00:16:05.480 --> 00:16:06.714
How about that brother?

318
00:16:06.847 --> 00:16:08.513
Aidan?

319
00:16:08.647 --> 00:16:09.647
He's married.

320
00:16:09.780 --> 00:16:11.447
That's not what Riley said.

321
00:16:11.580 --> 00:16:13.347
Really?

322
00:16:13.480 --> 00:16:14.213
What'd she say?

323
00:16:14.347 --> 00:16:17.447
Not much, but Aidan
is a single dad.


324
00:16:18.380 --> 00:16:19.647
His sister is my client.

325
00:16:19.780 --> 00:16:22.614
Besides, I am not looking
at dating right now.


326
00:16:22.747 --> 00:16:24.580
Okay, do you mind
if I date him?


327
00:16:25.480 --> 00:16:27.413
Umm, sure.

328
00:16:28.347 --> 00:16:30.380
I guess, I mean...

329
00:16:30.513 --> 00:16:31.580
Gotcha!

330
00:16:31.714 --> 00:16:33.647
You know you want to.

331
00:16:37.614 --> 00:16:38.946
Anyway, I'm going
to go for dinner.


332
00:16:39.080 --> 00:16:39.946
Want to grab a bite?

333
00:16:40.080 --> 00:16:42.213
Nah, thanks.
I'm gonna stick around here.


334
00:16:42.347 --> 00:16:43.980
Deep clean the mixers.

335
00:16:44.113 --> 00:16:45.180
You did that yesterday.

336
00:16:45.313 --> 00:16:46.480
I did?

337
00:16:46.614 --> 00:16:48.280
Well, they can
never be too clean!


338
00:16:49.647 --> 00:16:51.113
You work too much, Jess.

339
00:16:51.247 --> 00:16:53.413
But I respect that about you.

340
00:16:53.547 --> 00:16:54.714
I, on the other hand,

341
00:16:54.847 --> 00:16:57.380
plan on taking full advantage
of my night off.


342
00:16:57.513 --> 00:17:00.513
Enjoy it! I'm rooting for you!

343
00:17:27.580 --> 00:17:28.680
Hello!

344
00:17:28.814 --> 00:17:29.814
Please...

345
00:17:36.146 --> 00:17:37.046
Wow.

346
00:17:37.780 --> 00:17:39.614
Isn't it fabulous?

347
00:17:41.180 --> 00:17:42.247
This way...

348
00:17:55.680 --> 00:17:58.547
Wow, this certainly gives me
a lot of inspiration.


349
00:17:58.680 --> 00:18:01.146
I know, isn't it amazing?

350
00:18:01.913 --> 00:18:04.180
Definitely gives me
a lot to work with.


351
00:18:07.780 --> 00:18:10.513
Okay wow, Suzanne...

352
00:18:10.647 --> 00:18:12.146
You look amazing!

353
00:18:12.280 --> 00:18:13.714
Thank you!

354
00:18:13.847 --> 00:18:14.814
Stop!

355
00:18:15.946 --> 00:18:17.647
Oh, no thank you.

356
00:18:20.380 --> 00:18:22.347
I'm sorry, are you
having a party?


357
00:18:22.480 --> 00:18:23.714
I can come back another time.

358
00:18:23.847 --> 00:18:25.547
Oh no, of course not.

359
00:18:25.680 --> 00:18:27.447
I just really wanted you
to get a feel


360
00:18:27.580 --> 00:18:29.614
for what the wedding
will be like.


361
00:18:29.747 --> 00:18:31.780
Okay, well I'm definitely
getting a feel for it.


362
00:18:31.913 --> 00:18:34.347
Now, you'll just have
to imagine the poppies.


363
00:18:34.480 --> 00:18:36.347
They're being imported
from Oregon.


364
00:18:36.480 --> 00:18:37.513
They're beautiful.

365
00:18:38.614 --> 00:18:39.647
Oh, no thank you.

366
00:18:40.814 --> 00:18:41.747
Well...

367
00:18:42.780 --> 00:18:43.714
Yeah.

368
00:18:49.247 --> 00:18:51.714
Okay, wow... they're amazing.

369
00:18:51.847 --> 00:18:53.213
Right?

370
00:18:53.347 --> 00:18:54.380
Another?

371
00:18:57.780 --> 00:18:58.814
Should we get started?

372
00:18:58.946 --> 00:18:59.946
Please!

373
00:19:00.980 --> 00:19:03.213
[Aidan] Thank you,
we'll see you tomorrow.


374
00:19:05.946 --> 00:19:07.814
So, how was preschool today?

375
00:19:07.946 --> 00:19:08.913
It was good.

376
00:19:11.046 --> 00:19:12.513
Where are we going?

377
00:19:12.647 --> 00:19:13.580
Suzanne's.

378
00:19:14.547 --> 00:19:15.480
Oh.

379
00:19:16.447 --> 00:19:18.146
You love Aunt Suzanne's.

380
00:19:18.280 --> 00:19:20.680
Why can't you stay with me?

381
00:19:20.814 --> 00:19:23.680
I'm sorry Riley, but
I've got to go back to work.


382
00:19:23.814 --> 00:19:25.513
It's just for a
couple of hours, okay?


383
00:19:25.647 --> 00:19:26.513
Okay.

384
00:19:28.547 --> 00:19:30.480
Come on...

385
00:19:30.614 --> 00:19:32.647
There we go, big jump...

386
00:19:32.780 --> 00:19:33.747
Woo!

387
00:19:41.946 --> 00:19:43.547
I really love this one.

388
00:19:43.680 --> 00:19:45.180
Wonderful work so far.

389
00:19:45.313 --> 00:19:45.880
Thank you!

390
00:19:46.013 --> 00:19:47.747
I'll include your feedback

391
00:19:47.880 --> 00:19:50.680
and incorporate your inspiration
in the next design.


392
00:19:50.814 --> 00:19:53.280
Do you mind if I take
some photos while I'm here?


393
00:19:53.413 --> 00:19:54.513
By all means.

394
00:19:57.547 --> 00:19:59.180
Hello, darling.

395
00:20:00.046 --> 00:20:02.380
Hi, Aunt Suzanne.

396
00:20:02.513 --> 00:20:04.213
-Hey, sis.
-Hi.


397
00:20:04.347 --> 00:20:05.247
Hi, Jessie...

398
00:20:05.380 --> 00:20:06.180
Aidan!

399
00:20:06.313 --> 00:20:07.313
Nice to see you again.

400
00:20:07.447 --> 00:20:08.513
Yeah, you too.

401
00:20:10.513 --> 00:20:11.413
Thanks again for watching her.

402
00:20:11.547 --> 00:20:13.213
I'll be back as soon
as my meeting's over.


403
00:20:13.347 --> 00:20:13.913
No, I'm good.

404
00:20:14.046 --> 00:20:15.380
Take your time.

405
00:20:15.513 --> 00:20:17.380
-I'm between nannies.
-Ah.


406
00:20:17.513 --> 00:20:20.580
Good thing you have such a
caring and generous sister.


407
00:20:20.714 --> 00:20:22.247
Good thing, indeed.

408
00:20:24.046 --> 00:20:26.247
By the way, thanks again
for the rolling pin.


409
00:20:26.380 --> 00:20:28.247
She's been non-stop
talking about it


410
00:20:28.380 --> 00:20:30.480
and asking me
to bake with her.


411
00:20:30.614 --> 00:20:31.647
That's so sweet.

412
00:20:31.780 --> 00:20:33.647
Yeah, too bad I'm helpless
with that stuff.


413
00:20:33.780 --> 00:20:35.814
I could show her how
to bake sometime.


414
00:20:35.946 --> 00:20:37.480
Oh no, You've done
too much already.


415
00:20:37.614 --> 00:20:38.213
Thanks.

416
00:20:38.347 --> 00:20:39.347
No, it's really no problem.

417
00:20:39.480 --> 00:20:42.247
I learned from my grandma
when I was about her age,


418
00:20:42.380 --> 00:20:44.180
and it was really
special for me.


419
00:20:44.313 --> 00:20:45.680
I'd love to pass that along.

420
00:20:45.814 --> 00:20:47.614
Please dad, please?

421
00:20:48.513 --> 00:20:49.580
Okay.

422
00:20:49.714 --> 00:20:51.180
As long as that's okay with you.

423
00:20:51.313 --> 00:20:53.413
Why don't you guys stop by
after your meeting?


424
00:20:53.547 --> 00:20:54.847
The bakery will be
mostly empty by then


425
00:20:54.980 --> 00:20:56.313
and we'll have plenty of time.

426
00:20:56.447 --> 00:20:58.146
Unless you already have plans?

427
00:20:58.280 --> 00:20:59.580
No, it's a date.

428
00:21:03.913 --> 00:21:04.946
Umm...

429
00:21:05.946 --> 00:21:07.714
I mean, you know what I mean.

430
00:21:07.847 --> 00:21:08.814
I do.

431
00:21:10.647 --> 00:21:11.814
Well, I should get going.

432
00:21:11.946 --> 00:21:15.313
Make sure the bakery
isn't falling apart without me.


433
00:21:15.447 --> 00:21:16.714
I'll see you later.

434
00:21:16.847 --> 00:21:19.714
And I'll send over the new
designs when they're ready.


435
00:21:19.847 --> 00:21:20.747
Sure.

436
00:21:23.880 --> 00:21:25.480
Sorry.
(giggling)


437
00:21:31.847 --> 00:21:33.313
What?

438
00:21:33.447 --> 00:21:35.347
Oh, please.

439
00:21:35.480 --> 00:21:36.880
Go to your meeting.

440
00:21:37.980 --> 00:21:39.480
Okay. Bye you!

441
00:21:39.614 --> 00:21:40.814
Bye, daddy.

442
00:21:44.647 --> 00:21:46.580
Hey, how was Suzanne's?

443
00:21:46.714 --> 00:21:47.614
What's her house like?

444
00:21:47.747 --> 00:21:48.913
Is it fabulous?

445
00:21:49.046 --> 00:21:49.847
It's big.

446
00:21:49.980 --> 00:21:52.814
And it's pretty
fabulous, actually.


447
00:21:52.946 --> 00:21:56.347
Well, no media outlets cared
about my press release.


448
00:21:56.480 --> 00:21:57.614
Shocking.

449
00:21:57.747 --> 00:21:58.680
Super surprised.

450
00:21:58.814 --> 00:22:01.380
But I did announce it
on our Instagram page.


451
00:22:01.513 --> 00:22:02.747
We have an Instagram page?

452
00:22:02.880 --> 00:22:04.647
How many followers do we have?

453
00:22:05.980 --> 00:22:06.913
10...

454
00:22:07.814 --> 00:22:08.946
Well, that's a start.

455
00:22:09.080 --> 00:22:10.680
I'm working on it.

456
00:22:10.814 --> 00:22:13.647
Oh Beatrice, I was going
to stay a little later today


457
00:22:13.780 --> 00:22:15.413
to give Riley some
baking lessons.


458
00:22:15.547 --> 00:22:17.680
So if you want to
take off early, you can.


459
00:22:17.814 --> 00:22:20.447
Ooh, maybe I'll go to the gym.

460
00:22:21.413 --> 00:22:22.347
Nah!

461
00:22:22.480 --> 00:22:24.747
Lessons are a great idea.

462
00:22:24.880 --> 00:22:25.747
How much are you charging?

463
00:22:25.880 --> 00:22:26.747
I'm not charging anything.

464
00:22:26.880 --> 00:22:27.814
What?

465
00:22:27.946 --> 00:22:30.614
Jessie, how is that a
good use of your time?


466
00:22:31.547 --> 00:22:33.880
Business could be booming
if you wanted it to be.


467
00:22:34.013 --> 00:22:35.747
We're doing fine!

468
00:22:37.080 --> 00:22:40.280
We're doing fine right now!

469
00:22:40.413 --> 00:22:43.513
But we're one catastrophe away
from trouble.


470
00:22:43.647 --> 00:22:46.980
If you took that Belson's deal,
you could have peace of mind.


471
00:22:47.113 --> 00:22:49.380
A safety net for
when times are harder.


472
00:22:49.513 --> 00:22:51.980
You know how I feel
about that deal.


473
00:22:53.614 --> 00:22:55.280
I'm just saying.

474
00:22:55.413 --> 00:22:57.880
I want you to be in business
for a long time.


475
00:22:58.013 --> 00:23:01.347
I want your granddaughter to
inherit this place from you.


476
00:23:01.480 --> 00:23:02.513
I know.

477
00:23:02.647 --> 00:23:03.780
Thank you, Howard.

478
00:23:03.913 --> 00:23:06.480
I appreciate you,
and I'm listening.


479
00:23:06.614 --> 00:23:08.614
I just need to think about it.

480
00:23:09.547 --> 00:23:10.780
Are you guys okay?

481
00:23:11.680 --> 00:23:13.680
I don't like it when
Mom and Dad fight.


482
00:23:25.113 --> 00:23:28.847
(industrial mixer)

483
00:23:28.980 --> 00:23:30.180
(front doorbell rings)

484
00:23:36.847 --> 00:23:38.447
Hello?

485
00:23:38.580 --> 00:23:39.980
Hey guys, come on in!

486
00:23:40.113 --> 00:23:41.647
Hey, Jessie!

487
00:23:41.780 --> 00:23:42.780
You ready to bake?

488
00:23:42.913 --> 00:23:43.647
Yes!

489
00:23:43.780 --> 00:23:45.413
You bring your pin?

490
00:23:45.547 --> 00:23:46.113
Nice!

491
00:23:46.247 --> 00:23:47.780
You are ready to rock.

492
00:23:47.913 --> 00:23:49.580
Come on back.

493
00:23:49.714 --> 00:23:50.614
Here we go!

494
00:23:56.547 --> 00:24:00.213
Or you can roll them out thin,
like this.


495
00:24:01.714 --> 00:24:02.714
(yawns)

496
00:24:04.046 --> 00:24:06.847
I think we might be
losing someone here.


497
00:24:06.980 --> 00:24:08.913
Yeah, I think you might
be right about that.


498
00:24:09.046 --> 00:24:10.513
I'll put these in the oven.

499
00:24:10.647 --> 00:24:11.913
You think she has

500
00:24:12.046 --> 00:24:14.747
Yeah, she should be able
to handle that.


501
00:24:18.946 --> 00:24:20.980
Hey you... sleepy?

502
00:24:21.880 --> 00:24:23.946
Yeah? We'll go home soon, okay?

503
00:24:32.980 --> 00:24:34.946
We really wore her out.

504
00:24:35.080 --> 00:24:36.814
She had a great time.

505
00:24:36.946 --> 00:24:38.814
We both did, thank you.

506
00:24:38.946 --> 00:24:40.814
I had a great time, too.

507
00:24:41.714 --> 00:24:43.480
You know, it's really nice
of you to do this.


508
00:24:43.614 --> 00:24:44.480
I'm sure after baking all day,

509
00:24:44.614 --> 00:24:46.647
it's the last thing
you feel like doing.


510
00:24:46.780 --> 00:24:49.013
I could bake all day, every day.

511
00:24:49.146 --> 00:24:50.480
Don't worry about that.

512
00:24:50.614 --> 00:24:51.980
You really love it, huh?

513
00:24:52.113 --> 00:24:53.146
I do.

514
00:24:53.280 --> 00:24:55.580
I feel really lucky
to run this place.


515
00:24:55.714 --> 00:24:57.880
You are, you're very lucky.

516
00:24:58.013 --> 00:24:59.714
Not everyone gets to do
what they love.


517
00:24:59.847 --> 00:25:00.946
I sure don't.

518
00:25:01.080 --> 00:25:02.146
You don't love what you do?

519
00:25:02.280 --> 00:25:03.180
Real estate?

520
00:25:03.313 --> 00:25:04.146
No.

521
00:25:04.280 --> 00:25:08.513
Well what would you do,
if you could?


522
00:25:08.647 --> 00:25:09.380
It's silly.

523
00:25:09.513 --> 00:25:11.680
I'm sure it's not.
Come on, tell me.


524
00:25:12.714 --> 00:25:14.313
I used to build furniture.

525
00:25:15.814 --> 00:25:18.913
I always dreamed of opening up
my own shop, selling my stuff.


526
00:25:19.046 --> 00:25:20.847
You can do that?
That's amazing.


527
00:25:20.980 --> 00:25:21.880
Why don't you?

528
00:25:22.013 --> 00:25:24.880
It's not exactly a
guaranteed career path.


529
00:25:25.013 --> 00:25:28.113
Being a single dad, it's too
risky for me to do my own thing.


530
00:25:28.247 --> 00:25:30.580
Is Riley's mom in the picture?

531
00:25:30.714 --> 00:25:33.180
Sorry, you don't
have to answer that.


532
00:25:33.313 --> 00:25:34.547
No, it's okay.

533
00:25:37.980 --> 00:25:39.913
She passed a few years ago.

534
00:25:41.380 --> 00:25:42.880
I'm so sorry.

535
00:25:43.013 --> 00:25:43.913
Thanks.

536
00:25:48.180 --> 00:25:50.080
I think you should do it.

537
00:25:50.213 --> 00:25:51.680
The carpentry?

538
00:25:51.814 --> 00:25:52.614
Yes!

539
00:25:52.747 --> 00:25:54.013
Just go for it.

540
00:25:54.146 --> 00:25:57.213
Yeah, maybe in another lifetime,
when I'm retired.


541
00:25:57.347 --> 00:25:58.847
You don't have to quit your job,

542
00:25:58.980 --> 00:26:01.847
just start doing it
in your spare time.


543
00:26:01.980 --> 00:26:04.814
I'm a single dad,
spare time doesn't exist.


544
00:26:04.946 --> 00:26:06.180
-Fair enough.
-Yeah.


545
00:26:07.814 --> 00:26:10.280
Well, I'd love to see
your work sometime.


546
00:26:10.413 --> 00:26:12.380
I'd love to show it to you.

547
00:26:14.247 --> 00:26:15.814
(timer beeps)

548
00:26:20.213 --> 00:26:21.347
The cookies are done.

549
00:26:21.480 --> 00:26:23.913
Right... the cookies.

550
00:26:26.880 --> 00:26:29.847
Well... I'm going to run her out
to the car, she's tired.


551
00:26:29.980 --> 00:26:31.913
I'll go get us some cookies.

552
00:26:45.280 --> 00:26:46.847
She'll sleep the whole way home.

553
00:26:46.980 --> 00:26:49.013
Don't forget her cut
of the cookies.


554
00:26:49.146 --> 00:26:50.113
She earned them.

555
00:26:51.480 --> 00:26:52.946
She had a great time.

556
00:26:53.080 --> 00:26:53.980
Thank you.

557
00:26:54.113 --> 00:26:56.747
Next time we can
move onto cakes.


558
00:26:56.880 --> 00:26:58.046
Next time?

559
00:26:58.180 --> 00:27:00.680
Sure, I mean if
you're interested.


560
00:27:00.814 --> 00:27:01.847
Yeah.

561
00:27:01.980 --> 00:27:03.847
Yeah, that'd be great.

562
00:27:04.547 --> 00:27:05.447
Good.

563
00:27:06.880 --> 00:27:10.180
And thank you again
for the lesson.


564
00:27:11.980 --> 00:27:12.880
Anytime.

565
00:27:17.280 --> 00:27:18.247
Good night.

566
00:27:19.780 --> 00:27:20.747
Night.

567
00:27:29.146 --> 00:27:30.946
(industrial mixer)

568
00:27:44.780 --> 00:27:45.714
What?

569
00:27:45.847 --> 00:27:47.747
So nothing happened, huh?

570
00:27:47.880 --> 00:27:49.046
Nothing happened.

571
00:27:49.180 --> 00:27:51.213
I told you, his sister
is my client.


572
00:27:51.347 --> 00:27:53.747
It would be unprofessional.

573
00:27:53.880 --> 00:27:57.113
You're telling me you have
an available, handsome, sweet,


574
00:27:57.247 --> 00:28:00.480
hunk of a man in front of you,
with a great job and a cute kid


575
00:28:00.614 --> 00:28:04.180
and you're passing because
you're making his sister a cake?


576
00:28:04.313 --> 00:28:05.913
Well, when you
put it like that...


577
00:28:06.046 --> 00:28:07.980
You aren't her estate lawyer.

578
00:28:08.113 --> 00:28:09.213
Get over it!

579
00:28:12.046 --> 00:28:13.347
Guys...

580
00:28:13.480 --> 00:28:14.913
I have bad news.

581
00:28:15.046 --> 00:28:15.913
What's up?

582
00:28:17.013 --> 00:28:20.946
I just got a letter from
the owner of our building.


583
00:28:21.080 --> 00:28:23.046
They're putting it up
for sale in two weeks.


584
00:28:23.180 --> 00:28:26.080
We could be forced out
the second the deal closes.


585
00:28:26.213 --> 00:28:27.113
What?

586
00:28:27.247 --> 00:28:28.714
They can't do that.

587
00:28:28.847 --> 00:28:30.480
What if the new owners
want us to stay?


588
00:28:30.614 --> 00:28:32.714
They already have multiple
bidders lined up.


589
00:28:32.847 --> 00:28:34.046
They're all developers.

590
00:28:34.180 --> 00:28:36.180
They're just going to tear this
place down and build condos.


591
00:28:36.313 --> 00:28:38.380
This is a prime location.

592
00:28:38.513 --> 00:28:40.146
They can't kick us out.

593
00:28:40.280 --> 00:28:42.213
This shop has been here
for 65 years.


594
00:28:42.347 --> 00:28:43.946
It's a piece of
the town's history.


595
00:28:44.080 --> 00:28:46.380
It should be a designated
historical landmark,


596
00:28:46.513 --> 00:28:47.313
for crying out loud.

597
00:28:47.447 --> 00:28:50.046
There's no bakery
without this building.


598
00:28:51.180 --> 00:28:52.280
How much are they asking?

599
00:28:52.413 --> 00:28:53.913
Maybe I can buy it?

600
00:28:54.547 --> 00:28:57.747
It's more than you
would make in 10 years.


601
00:29:00.680 --> 00:29:01.847
We're done.

602
00:29:06.580 --> 00:29:09.113
We're not done.

603
00:29:09.247 --> 00:29:11.146
We'll figure something out.

604
00:29:11.280 --> 00:29:12.180
You were right.

605
00:29:12.313 --> 00:29:13.447
This is my catastrophe.

606
00:29:16.313 --> 00:29:18.247
We can recover from this.

607
00:29:18.380 --> 00:29:20.013
Let's just keep our heads.

608
00:29:20.146 --> 00:29:22.347
Don't you have that meeting
with Suzanne Cooper?


609
00:29:22.480 --> 00:29:23.580
What's the point?

610
00:29:26.913 --> 00:29:28.280
You're upset.

611
00:29:28.413 --> 00:29:31.046
But you can't let down a client.

612
00:29:32.146 --> 00:29:33.347
He's right.

613
00:29:33.480 --> 00:29:34.480
You need to go.

614
00:29:37.614 --> 00:29:38.513
I know.

615
00:29:51.080 --> 00:29:53.814
The wood is imported
from an island


616
00:29:53.946 --> 00:29:55.847
off the coast of Australia.

617
00:29:55.980 --> 00:29:58.946
Legend has it that the wood

618
00:29:59.080 --> 00:30:01.946
has magical powers
and turns into an elf


619
00:30:02.080 --> 00:30:03.847
if you rub its belly.

620
00:30:03.980 --> 00:30:05.380
Hello?

621
00:30:05.513 --> 00:30:06.980
Earth to Jessie.

622
00:30:07.113 --> 00:30:08.847
Oh yeah, it's a
gorgeous day out.


623
00:30:11.146 --> 00:30:13.380
I'm sorry,
I'm a little distracted.


624
00:30:14.547 --> 00:30:17.780
Do you want to talk
to me about something?


625
00:30:17.913 --> 00:30:19.113
What's going on with you?

626
00:30:19.247 --> 00:30:21.013
No, it's not like that.

627
00:30:21.146 --> 00:30:24.247
It's just...
stuff with the bakery.


628
00:30:24.380 --> 00:30:26.946
Well, why don't you
talk to me about it?


629
00:30:27.080 --> 00:30:29.946
I do know a thing or two
about business, you know.


630
00:30:31.113 --> 00:30:33.980
Okay, well, it's just...

631
00:30:34.113 --> 00:30:38.280
The company that owns
our building is selling.


632
00:30:38.413 --> 00:30:40.247
The bakery's never
been anywhere else.


633
00:30:42.046 --> 00:30:44.547
I can't even imagine moving.

634
00:30:45.480 --> 00:30:47.980
It breaks my heart
just to think about it.


635
00:30:48.113 --> 00:30:50.113
Yes, well that's why
you want to own


636
00:30:50.247 --> 00:30:51.280
the building you're in.

637
00:30:51.413 --> 00:30:53.880
Yeah, I know that now.

638
00:30:54.013 --> 00:30:55.280
Thanks.

639
00:30:55.413 --> 00:30:58.247
Okay, so what are your options?

640
00:30:58.380 --> 00:31:01.180
We can't afford to buy it, so...

641
00:31:02.213 --> 00:31:04.013
Find some place else, or...

642
00:31:06.280 --> 00:31:07.247
Or close.

643
00:31:08.247 --> 00:31:09.280
Close?

644
00:31:09.413 --> 00:31:11.046
Do you no longer want
to run the bakery?


645
00:31:11.180 --> 00:31:12.413
No, of course I do.

646
00:31:12.547 --> 00:31:14.614
Then why would you
close it down?


647
00:31:14.747 --> 00:31:17.447
Because it won't be the same!

648
00:31:17.580 --> 00:31:19.013
That's it?

649
00:31:21.347 --> 00:31:25.580
Honey, life is never going
to go according to plan.


650
00:31:25.714 --> 00:31:28.247
You can't let that paralyze you.

651
00:31:28.380 --> 00:31:30.913
The way I see it,
you've got two options.


652
00:31:31.046 --> 00:31:33.580
You move and make
the best of it.


653
00:31:33.714 --> 00:31:36.513
Or, you fight it with
everything you've got.


654
00:31:40.313 --> 00:31:41.980
Now let's get to work.

655
00:31:51.747 --> 00:31:53.280
Howard, take the deal!

656
00:32:01.480 --> 00:32:03.480
Howard, take the deal!

657
00:32:04.780 --> 00:32:06.380
What deal?

658
00:32:06.513 --> 00:32:07.280
Belson's?

659
00:32:07.413 --> 00:32:08.913
That's the one.

660
00:32:09.046 --> 00:32:10.280
Really?

661
00:32:10.413 --> 00:32:12.480
We're not going down
without a fight.


662
00:32:12.614 --> 00:32:14.180
That's what I like to hear!

663
00:32:14.313 --> 00:32:15.680
Did she just say what
I think she said?


664
00:32:15.814 --> 00:32:17.946
We're cranking it up to 100!

665
00:32:18.080 --> 00:32:20.247
Howard, now's the time
to lay out any other


666
00:32:20.380 --> 00:32:22.247
money-making tricks
you've got on the table.


667
00:32:22.380 --> 00:32:23.614
We're gonna buy this place.

668
00:32:23.747 --> 00:32:24.680
Let's do this!

669
00:32:24.814 --> 00:32:25.780
This is what I live for.

670
00:32:25.913 --> 00:32:28.247
Miriam's Sweet Treats
began in this building.


671
00:32:28.380 --> 00:32:30.247
And this is where
it's gonna stay.


672
00:32:32.714 --> 00:32:37.080
♪ Hold my head,
till the courage sticks ♪


673
00:32:37.213 --> 00:32:42.146
♪ Shine the light,
till the darkness lifts ♪


674
00:32:50.714 --> 00:32:55.247
♪ Hold me up,
so I don't look weak ♪


675
00:32:55.380 --> 00:33:00.046
♪ Soon I'll stand,
on my own two feet ♪


676
00:33:00.780 --> 00:33:02.547
♪ ♪

677
00:33:24.447 --> 00:33:26.447
I didn't realize that
cranking it up to 100


678
00:33:26.580 --> 00:33:28.247
meant cranking out
cake day and night,


679
00:33:28.380 --> 00:33:30.513
all day, every night.

680
00:33:30.647 --> 00:33:32.113
I'm having cake stress dreams.

681
00:33:32.247 --> 00:33:33.113
I'm sorry, Bea.

682
00:33:33.247 --> 00:33:35.213
There wasn't time
to hire anybody else.


683
00:33:35.347 --> 00:33:38.213
Belson's needs these early
tomorrow for their test run.


684
00:33:38.347 --> 00:33:40.046
Beatrice, I can't read
your handwriting.


685
00:33:40.180 --> 00:33:42.313
Does this say
two or three eggs?


686
00:33:42.447 --> 00:33:45.313
So does all this extra work
mean we're getting raises?


687
00:33:45.447 --> 00:33:47.680
I need to save every penny
I can right now,


688
00:33:47.814 --> 00:33:50.013
but as soon as we
buy the building,


689
00:33:50.146 --> 00:33:51.046
I promise, huge raises
for everyone!


690
00:33:51.180 --> 00:33:53.380
Is it two or
three eggs, Beatrice?


691
00:33:53.513 --> 00:33:54.447
Two or three eggs?

692
00:33:54.580 --> 00:33:56.447
Whoa, Howard.

693
00:33:56.580 --> 00:33:57.614
You okay, bud?

694
00:33:57.747 --> 00:33:59.380
Why don't you take
a little break?


695
00:33:59.513 --> 00:34:05.447
I just... need to know
how many... eggs.


696
00:34:05.580 --> 00:34:07.046
Okay.

697
00:34:07.180 --> 00:34:08.547
Just take a little break.

698
00:34:08.680 --> 00:34:10.347
Little breather.

699
00:34:10.480 --> 00:34:11.847
-Little break?
-Yeah.


700
00:34:17.880 --> 00:34:19.180
(front door chime)

701
00:34:24.780 --> 00:34:26.447
Aidan? What a surprise.

702
00:34:26.580 --> 00:34:28.046
What are you guys doing here?

703
00:34:28.180 --> 00:34:29.580
We were just out for dinner
up the street


704
00:34:29.714 --> 00:34:30.647
and we saw your light on.

705
00:34:30.780 --> 00:34:31.780
I'm surprised you're
still working.


706
00:34:31.913 --> 00:34:33.180
New grocery store deal.

707
00:34:33.313 --> 00:34:34.513
Just trying to keep up.

708
00:34:34.647 --> 00:34:35.714
Nice.

709
00:34:36.880 --> 00:34:39.146
Well, Riley here really wanted
to give you something.


710
00:34:39.280 --> 00:34:41.113
Luckily, we had it in the car.

711
00:34:41.247 --> 00:34:42.347
Thank you.

712
00:34:42.480 --> 00:34:44.046
What's this?

713
00:34:44.180 --> 00:34:46.146
It's a thank you present
for the lessons.


714
00:34:46.280 --> 00:34:47.680
These are beautiful,
thank you.


715
00:34:47.814 --> 00:34:48.814
We made them.

716
00:34:48.946 --> 00:34:50.480
You made them?

717
00:34:50.614 --> 00:34:52.146
Wow, I'm impressed!

718
00:34:52.280 --> 00:34:53.547
You're really talented.

719
00:34:53.680 --> 00:34:56.647
We could show you how
sometime if you want.


720
00:34:56.780 --> 00:34:59.046
I would love that, thank you.

721
00:34:59.180 --> 00:35:01.614
Anytime, we'd love to
show you the workshop.


722
00:35:01.747 --> 00:35:03.647
Just tell me when.

723
00:35:03.780 --> 00:35:05.247
How about tomorrow?

724
00:35:05.380 --> 00:35:08.580
Okay, I could stop by
after I send off the cakes.


725
00:35:08.714 --> 00:35:10.247
Great.

726
00:35:10.380 --> 00:35:12.313
Here, I'll write down
my address.


727
00:35:12.447 --> 00:35:13.580
Sleepy, huh?

728
00:35:14.580 --> 00:35:16.247
All right, there it is.

729
00:35:17.780 --> 00:35:20.180
Thank you, and thank you
for the spoons.


730
00:35:20.313 --> 00:35:21.647
You're welcome.

731
00:35:23.280 --> 00:35:24.146
All right, see you.

732
00:35:24.280 --> 00:35:25.413
-Bye.
-Bye.


733
00:35:25.547 --> 00:35:26.814
Come on you munchkin!

734
00:35:32.580 --> 00:35:33.513
What?

735
00:35:35.347 --> 00:35:36.213
Nothing!

736
00:35:36.347 --> 00:35:37.213
Nothing at all.

737
00:35:37.347 --> 00:35:39.347
Okay, back to work you two.

738
00:35:39.480 --> 00:35:41.280
Just a few more cakes
and we're done.


739
00:35:41.413 --> 00:35:43.347
Howard, I'm putting
you on dish duty.


740
00:35:43.480 --> 00:35:44.614
Oh, thank goodness.

741
00:35:52.614 --> 00:35:54.680
(airy guitar music)

742
00:36:15.946 --> 00:36:16.814
There you go.

743
00:36:17.547 --> 00:36:18.747
Very good!

744
00:36:18.880 --> 00:36:21.013
Now back and forth, perfect.
Little more up there.


745
00:36:23.213 --> 00:36:24.780
Right here, see this one?

746
00:36:24.913 --> 00:36:26.513
Hello?

747
00:36:26.647 --> 00:36:27.513
Jessie!

748
00:36:27.647 --> 00:36:28.780
You made it!

749
00:36:28.913 --> 00:36:29.880
Hi, Jessie!

750
00:36:30.013 --> 00:36:30.946
Hi guys!

751
00:36:32.946 --> 00:36:35.313
Did you make these?
These are incredible...


752
00:36:35.447 --> 00:36:37.814
It was mostly her, I helped.

753
00:36:37.946 --> 00:36:39.547
They're beautiful.

754
00:36:39.680 --> 00:36:40.913
Thank you.

755
00:36:41.046 --> 00:36:42.347
You are an artist.

756
00:36:42.480 --> 00:36:43.780
Nah.

757
00:36:43.913 --> 00:36:45.847
I'm serious, these take talent.

758
00:36:45.980 --> 00:36:49.614
Do you ant me to teach you
how to hammer?


759
00:36:49.747 --> 00:36:50.946
Okay there, little lady.

760
00:36:51.080 --> 00:36:53.714
What'd we say about touching
tools without dad's permission?


761
00:36:53.847 --> 00:36:55.313
Not to do it.

762
00:36:55.447 --> 00:36:56.580
That's right.

763
00:36:56.714 --> 00:36:58.980
Now just gonna, excuse me.

764
00:36:59.113 --> 00:37:02.447
Gonna put you there, okay?

765
00:37:02.580 --> 00:37:04.480
Now, are you ready to rumble?

766
00:37:06.046 --> 00:37:07.046
We're jumping right
to power saws?


767
00:37:07.180 --> 00:37:11.814
There's no intro or
a nice little safety course?


768
00:37:12.747 --> 00:37:14.380
Here's what you need
to know about safety:


769
00:37:14.513 --> 00:37:15.714
Safety first!

770
00:37:18.580 --> 00:37:20.814
Here's what you need to know...

771
00:37:20.946 --> 00:37:22.580
Don't cut your fingers off.

772
00:37:22.714 --> 00:37:23.447
Perfect.

773
00:37:23.580 --> 00:37:24.680
And wear these.

774
00:37:27.247 --> 00:37:29.847
You already got your goggles on,
look at you.


775
00:37:31.213 --> 00:37:32.780
Gotta put these on now.

776
00:37:32.913 --> 00:37:34.547
Here we go!

777
00:37:34.680 --> 00:37:36.747
We have the same ones!

778
00:37:36.880 --> 00:37:38.013
Yeah, we're twins!

779
00:37:38.946 --> 00:37:40.180
Okay, let's do this.

780
00:37:41.146 --> 00:37:42.113
You ready?

781
00:37:42.247 --> 00:37:43.413
All right.

782
00:37:54.113 --> 00:37:55.747
Who wants sandwiches?

783
00:37:55.880 --> 00:37:56.680
Me!

784
00:37:56.814 --> 00:37:58.747
Go wash your hands first.

785
00:37:58.880 --> 00:38:00.980
You have a bottle
of Seaside Pearl?


786
00:38:01.113 --> 00:38:02.480
Are you a collector?

787
00:38:02.614 --> 00:38:03.680
No, not really.

788
00:38:05.113 --> 00:38:07.814
It was a gift from a client.

789
00:38:07.946 --> 00:38:10.946
He said it was
a good vintage, so...


790
00:38:11.080 --> 00:38:12.880
I've been waiting for a
special occasion to open it.


791
00:38:13.013 --> 00:38:15.614
My grandfather took my grandma
on a tour of their vineyard


792
00:38:15.747 --> 00:38:17.180
on their very first date.

793
00:38:17.313 --> 00:38:19.146
You're kidding!
Have you ever been?


794
00:38:19.280 --> 00:38:20.580
It's actually not
too far from here.


795
00:38:20.714 --> 00:38:21.480
I've always wanted to,

796
00:38:21.614 --> 00:38:23.513
but I've been so busy
with the bakery,


797
00:38:23.647 --> 00:38:24.480
I haven't had a chance.

798
00:38:24.614 --> 00:38:25.647
You have been working a lot,

799
00:38:25.780 --> 00:38:27.647
business must be booming.

800
00:38:27.780 --> 00:38:28.880
Something like that.

801
00:38:29.847 --> 00:38:31.614
Is everything okay?

802
00:38:31.747 --> 00:38:32.946
I'm a little stressed
about the bakery.


803
00:38:33.080 --> 00:38:34.913
I don't want to be a bummer.

804
00:38:35.046 --> 00:38:36.814
No, be a bummer!
What's going on?


805
00:38:36.946 --> 00:38:38.913
The owner of our building
is selling.


806
00:38:39.046 --> 00:38:42.580
Probably to some developer,
who's going to kick us out.


807
00:38:42.714 --> 00:38:44.146
-Oh, shoot.
-Yeah.


808
00:38:44.280 --> 00:38:45.913
It's a long shot, but...

809
00:38:46.046 --> 00:38:47.680
We're going to try
to buy it ourselves.


810
00:38:47.814 --> 00:38:48.913
That would be amazing!

811
00:38:49.046 --> 00:38:50.180
Can you pull it off?

812
00:38:50.313 --> 00:38:52.480
I don't know, but
we're going to try.


813
00:38:52.614 --> 00:38:53.780
Hence all the overtime.

814
00:38:53.913 --> 00:38:56.714
If there's anything I can do
to help, please just tell me.


815
00:38:56.847 --> 00:38:57.647
-Thank you.
-I mean it.


816
00:38:57.780 --> 00:39:00.913
I'll bake, I'll clean,
I'll make flyers.


817
00:39:01.046 --> 00:39:03.247
We'd do anything
to help, right?


818
00:39:04.913 --> 00:39:06.847
That means a lot, thank you.

819
00:39:06.980 --> 00:39:10.113
Yeah... actually, do
you know who's selling?


820
00:39:10.247 --> 00:39:11.946
Maybe I've worked
with them before.


821
00:39:12.080 --> 00:39:14.547
A realtor: Island View, I think?

822
00:39:14.680 --> 00:39:15.714
You're kidding.

823
00:39:15.847 --> 00:39:17.814
My boss's brother
runs that place.


824
00:39:17.946 --> 00:39:19.747
I'll ask him to put
in a good word for you.


825
00:39:19.880 --> 00:39:21.180
Really? You'd do that?

826
00:39:21.313 --> 00:39:22.280
Yeah, of course.

827
00:39:23.347 --> 00:39:25.647
I don't know what to say,
that would be huge.


828
00:39:25.780 --> 00:39:26.580
Thank you.

829
00:39:26.714 --> 00:39:28.013
It would be my pleasure.

830
00:39:31.313 --> 00:39:33.113
Well, let's dig in.

831
00:39:34.080 --> 00:39:35.946
Yeah? Here you go...

832
00:39:38.913 --> 00:39:39.913
Great job...

833
00:39:50.046 --> 00:39:52.213
So you went to the
hot brother's house...


834
00:39:52.347 --> 00:39:54.113
He taught you woodworking?

835
00:39:55.313 --> 00:39:56.747
You watched cartoons
with his kid,


836
00:39:56.880 --> 00:39:58.946
stay late, and that's it?

837
00:39:59.980 --> 00:40:01.213
That's it.

838
00:40:01.347 --> 00:40:03.080
Well, actually that's not it.

839
00:40:03.213 --> 00:40:05.614
He's going to put in a good word
with the seller's realtor.


840
00:40:05.747 --> 00:40:09.547
Right, but is he interested?
Like, romantically?


841
00:40:09.680 --> 00:40:10.280
Beatrice...

842
00:40:10.413 --> 00:40:11.946
What? I don't get you, Jess.

843
00:40:12.080 --> 00:40:13.080
What's the big whoop?

844
00:40:13.213 --> 00:40:14.680
Is it Suzanne?

845
00:40:14.814 --> 00:40:16.580
Aidan's amazing, really.

846
00:40:16.714 --> 00:40:19.013
I'm just focused on
saving the bakery right now.


847
00:40:19.146 --> 00:40:20.847
One thing at a time here.

848
00:40:20.980 --> 00:40:21.946
Whatever you say, Jessie.

849
00:40:22.080 --> 00:40:24.213
I can't help someone
who won't help themselves.


850
00:40:24.347 --> 00:40:25.946
The test cakes were a success!

851
00:40:26.080 --> 00:40:28.247
They sold out before lunch.

852
00:40:28.380 --> 00:40:29.714
Belson's is doubling the order.

853
00:40:29.847 --> 00:40:31.680
-Are you serious?
-I'm serious.


854
00:40:31.814 --> 00:40:34.714
And twice the order,
means twice the money.


855
00:40:34.847 --> 00:40:36.180
We're going to have
to hire more people.


856
00:40:36.313 --> 00:40:37.780
And rent a second kitchen.

857
00:40:37.913 --> 00:40:38.946
It would be well worth it,

858
00:40:39.080 --> 00:40:42.013
because I have a ton of
great ideas for expansion.


859
00:40:42.146 --> 00:40:43.880
This is why we love you, Howard.

860
00:40:44.013 --> 00:40:46.580
We might actually be able
to buy this place.


861
00:40:46.714 --> 00:40:48.513
I know.

862
00:40:48.647 --> 00:40:49.913
Let's do all we can.

863
00:40:50.046 --> 00:40:51.847
Howard, put out an ad
for more bakers.


864
00:40:51.980 --> 00:40:54.714
Beatrice, work with our vendors
to up our orders.


865
00:40:54.847 --> 00:40:56.847
I'll review that binder.

866
00:40:56.980 --> 00:40:58.280
We're going to
give this all we got.


867
00:40:58.413 --> 00:40:59.946
-Yeah we are!
-I'm pumped!


868
00:41:00.080 --> 00:41:01.946
This is for you, grandma.

869
00:41:04.247 --> 00:41:05.380
Nice...

870
00:41:10.247 --> 00:41:11.647
Please, have a seat.

871
00:41:14.714 --> 00:41:15.780
Very nice....

872
00:41:18.380 --> 00:41:21.580
Smells... interesting...

873
00:41:21.714 --> 00:41:22.280
Next!

874
00:41:22.413 --> 00:41:24.213
Specializes in desserts?

875
00:41:25.814 --> 00:41:26.747
Thank you.

876
00:41:27.980 --> 00:41:30.046
Graduated in culinary arts?

877
00:41:30.180 --> 00:41:32.714
Oh, available in three months?

878
00:41:32.847 --> 00:41:35.180
Been baking since
you were six?


879
00:41:35.313 --> 00:41:38.113
Not a ton of
baking experience...


880
00:41:39.247 --> 00:41:40.113
Next!

881
00:41:41.447 --> 00:41:44.313
(upbeat pop rock song)

882
00:41:46.113 --> 00:41:48.814
Allergic to flour and eggs?

883
00:41:49.814 --> 00:41:50.747
Okay...

884
00:41:50.880 --> 00:41:52.980
You bought it today?

885
00:41:54.180 --> 00:41:56.814
Family oriented?
You got the job!


886
00:41:57.714 --> 00:41:59.046
Thank you so much
for coming in today.


887
00:41:59.180 --> 00:42:00.413
You've got the job!

888
00:42:07.347 --> 00:42:09.780
♪ Whoa you're my blue heaven

889
00:42:09.913 --> 00:42:14.913
♪ I need you right now
to make it okay ♪


890
00:42:19.347 --> 00:42:21.313
Anytime... yeah.

891
00:42:21.447 --> 00:42:23.180
-Perfect!
-Good job!


892
00:42:24.480 --> 00:42:25.946
All right, come on...

893
00:42:27.280 --> 00:42:29.380
Thanks again for
helping me hang these.


894
00:42:29.513 --> 00:42:32.880
We're just doing it for
first dibs on the free samples.


895
00:42:33.013 --> 00:42:35.113
I happen to know the owner,
you know.


896
00:42:35.247 --> 00:42:38.180
I could get you access
to those samples in advance.


897
00:42:38.313 --> 00:42:39.747
Favorable treatment?

898
00:42:39.880 --> 00:42:40.847
Exciting!

899
00:42:42.547 --> 00:42:44.780
So, how's the workload going?

900
00:42:45.513 --> 00:42:46.946
It's intense.

901
00:42:47.080 --> 00:42:49.046
The Belson's deal
is going so well,


902
00:42:49.180 --> 00:42:51.780
they want to expand our cakes
to their other stores.


903
00:42:51.913 --> 00:42:52.680
Wow...

904
00:42:52.814 --> 00:42:54.046
I hired a few more bakers,

905
00:42:54.180 --> 00:42:57.647
but I think Howard and Beatrice
are still a little burned out.


906
00:42:57.780 --> 00:42:58.647
What about you?

907
00:42:58.780 --> 00:43:00.113
Sounds like you
could use a break, too.


908
00:43:00.247 --> 00:43:03.146
I wish, there's
still so much to do.


909
00:43:03.280 --> 00:43:04.847
You can't spare an hour?

910
00:43:05.547 --> 00:43:06.946
For what?

911
00:43:07.080 --> 00:43:09.180
What if I told you
it was a secret?


912
00:43:09.313 --> 00:43:11.413
I would say I'm intrigued.

913
00:43:11.547 --> 00:43:12.480
You free tonight?

914
00:43:12.614 --> 00:43:14.913
Say around 6?

915
00:43:15.046 --> 00:43:17.180
Just going to be
working, as usual.


916
00:43:17.313 --> 00:43:20.247
Meet me at the corner
of Hartford and Atwood?


917
00:43:20.380 --> 00:43:21.946
What's all the way out there?

918
00:43:22.080 --> 00:43:24.013
I already told you,
it's a secret.


919
00:43:24.146 --> 00:43:25.146
Okay.

920
00:43:25.280 --> 00:43:26.714
-I'll see you there.
-Perfect.


921
00:43:26.847 --> 00:43:27.480
[Jessie] Perfect!

922
00:43:33.480 --> 00:43:36.946
We should get up,
we have so much to do.


923
00:43:37.080 --> 00:43:38.480
I'm so exhausted.

924
00:43:39.380 --> 00:43:41.814
There's so much work to do.

925
00:43:41.946 --> 00:43:44.280
How many more cakes
do we need?


926
00:43:44.413 --> 00:43:46.747
For the promotion? Five.

927
00:43:47.480 --> 00:43:48.747
For Belson's?

928
00:43:50.046 --> 00:43:51.113
About five million.

929
00:43:54.046 --> 00:43:58.313
Once we buy the building,
we'll hire even more people.


930
00:43:58.447 --> 00:43:59.313
The...

931
00:44:00.513 --> 00:44:01.780
finish line is in sight.

932
00:44:01.913 --> 00:44:03.980
We just need to
keep that in mind.


933
00:44:04.113 --> 00:44:04.847
Exactly.

934
00:44:04.980 --> 00:44:06.013
Okay...

935
00:44:07.680 --> 00:44:09.347
I'm getting up.

936
00:44:10.413 --> 00:44:11.280
Me too.

937
00:44:12.380 --> 00:44:15.380
Alright, I'm going to
take off for a little bit.


938
00:44:15.513 --> 00:44:17.380
What? Wait...

939
00:44:17.513 --> 00:44:20.080
Where are you going?
You look so pretty.


940
00:44:21.013 --> 00:44:22.480
I'm suspicious.

941
00:44:22.614 --> 00:44:23.380
I have a thing.

942
00:44:23.513 --> 00:44:25.980
It's almost six,
when did that happen?


943
00:44:26.113 --> 00:44:28.513
I guess we should eat dinner
and then get back to work.


944
00:44:28.647 --> 00:44:30.447
Yeah... can't wait.

945
00:44:30.580 --> 00:44:32.347
Why don't you guys
take the night off?


946
00:44:32.480 --> 00:44:33.413
What?

947
00:44:33.547 --> 00:44:36.013
We have a ton of work to do.

948
00:44:36.146 --> 00:44:38.480
You guys deserve
a break, really.


949
00:44:38.614 --> 00:44:40.313
We're in great shape
for the promotion,


950
00:44:40.447 --> 00:44:42.880
and our next Belson's order
isn't for a few days.


951
00:44:43.013 --> 00:44:43.880
I don't know...

952
00:44:44.013 --> 00:44:45.447
We still have five
more cakes for tomorrow.


953
00:44:45.580 --> 00:44:46.847
I will do them.

954
00:44:46.980 --> 00:44:48.513
You guys need a
good night's sleep.


955
00:44:48.647 --> 00:44:49.814
I insist.

956
00:44:51.380 --> 00:44:52.913
-Works for me.
-If you say so.


957
00:44:53.046 --> 00:44:53.946
Thanks, Jessie!

958
00:44:55.580 --> 00:44:57.547
So what's this thing
you're going to?


959
00:44:57.680 --> 00:45:01.280
I'm not exactly sure,
but I will be back in a bit!


960
00:45:11.146 --> 00:45:13.280
Where are we?

961
00:45:13.413 --> 00:45:14.614
Do you trust me?

962
00:45:14.747 --> 00:45:16.146
I trust you.

963
00:45:16.280 --> 00:45:18.580
Okay. Well, follow me.

964
00:45:24.447 --> 00:45:26.413
Welcome to Seaside Pearl Winery!

965
00:45:28.046 --> 00:45:29.413
Okay, I'm confused.

966
00:45:29.547 --> 00:45:31.347
Are we allowed to be in here?

967
00:45:31.480 --> 00:45:33.013
This place belongs
to one of my clients.


968
00:45:33.146 --> 00:45:34.313
This is incredible!

969
00:45:34.447 --> 00:45:35.280
Right?

970
00:45:39.247 --> 00:45:40.513
This is so sweet.

971
00:45:40.647 --> 00:45:43.347
I told you I was saving it
for a special occasion.


972
00:45:46.280 --> 00:45:47.880
Can I take your jacket?

973
00:45:48.013 --> 00:45:48.946
Please...

974
00:45:51.280 --> 00:45:52.146
Thank you.

975
00:45:56.313 --> 00:45:57.647
I got us some snacks.

976
00:45:57.780 --> 00:46:01.980
Thought you could use some food
of the non-cake variety.


977
00:46:02.847 --> 00:46:04.380
There we are.

978
00:46:04.513 --> 00:46:05.547
Oh, of course.

979
00:46:06.580 --> 00:46:07.547
Thank you.

980
00:46:10.080 --> 00:46:11.146
Thank you.

981
00:46:15.380 --> 00:46:17.447
I guess we've got
to open this first.


982
00:46:17.580 --> 00:46:18.714
Hope it's still good.

983
00:46:23.247 --> 00:46:24.747
(both laughing)

984
00:46:26.180 --> 00:46:27.113
Where's Riley?

985
00:46:28.213 --> 00:46:29.580
Suzanne's babysitting.

986
00:46:29.714 --> 00:46:31.247
That's nice of her.

987
00:46:31.380 --> 00:46:32.180
It is.

988
00:46:32.313 --> 00:46:33.480
It's good for her too.

989
00:46:33.614 --> 00:46:35.714
You don't always get your way
when a five year old's involved.


990
00:46:35.847 --> 00:46:36.980
Good point.

991
00:46:38.013 --> 00:46:41.113
Oh by the way, I talked
my boss' s brother.


992
00:46:41.247 --> 00:46:42.180
The realtor?

993
00:46:42.313 --> 00:46:43.447
What'd he say?

994
00:46:43.580 --> 00:46:44.580
He couldn't make any promises,

995
00:46:44.714 --> 00:46:48.313
but he told them your story
and they were impressed.


996
00:46:48.447 --> 00:46:50.247
They're going to
look out for your offer.


997
00:46:50.380 --> 00:46:51.480
-Really?
-Yup.


998
00:46:52.380 --> 00:46:54.247
Oh my gosh, thank you.

999
00:46:54.380 --> 00:46:55.480
Thank you so much.

1000
00:46:55.614 --> 00:46:56.647
It's really no problem.

1001
00:46:56.780 --> 00:46:59.313
I've put in so much overtime
for this guy, he owes me.


1002
00:46:59.447 --> 00:47:01.614
Still, you really put
yourself out there for me.


1003
00:47:01.747 --> 00:47:03.046
It means a lot.

1004
00:47:03.180 --> 00:47:04.113
Well, you're welcome.

1005
00:47:04.247 --> 00:47:07.146
I know how hard you've
been working for this.


1006
00:47:07.280 --> 00:47:09.547
So, you ready for the
big promotion tomorrow?


1007
00:47:10.580 --> 00:47:13.747
Almost, I have five cakes
left to bake tonight.


1008
00:47:13.880 --> 00:47:15.247
You need some help?

1009
00:47:16.146 --> 00:47:17.380
You want to bake?

1010
00:47:17.513 --> 00:47:18.513
Yeah.

1011
00:47:18.647 --> 00:47:22.180
I'm no expert, but I do
take directions pretty well.


1012
00:47:22.313 --> 00:47:23.480
You don't have to do that.

1013
00:47:23.614 --> 00:47:25.146
It's tons of work.

1014
00:47:25.280 --> 00:47:26.580
Seriously, I want to.

1015
00:47:27.714 --> 00:47:30.280
I did give Beatrice
and Howard the night off.


1016
00:47:30.413 --> 00:47:33.046
So you could use the company.

1017
00:47:33.180 --> 00:47:34.347
Come on...

1018
00:47:35.614 --> 00:47:37.614
Okay, sure.

1019
00:47:37.747 --> 00:47:38.614
Thanks.

1020
00:47:40.180 --> 00:47:42.247
No problem, cheers.

1021
00:47:42.380 --> 00:47:43.213
Cheers.

1022
00:47:49.647 --> 00:47:50.580
You're doing great.

1023
00:47:50.714 --> 00:47:52.247
I might need to
hire you full time!


1024
00:47:52.380 --> 00:47:53.447
Sign me up.

1025
00:47:56.146 --> 00:47:58.146
What do I do with this?

1026
00:47:58.280 --> 00:47:59.313
Put it in here.

1027
00:47:59.447 --> 00:48:00.380
Okay...

1028
00:48:02.247 --> 00:48:03.347
Like that.

1029
00:48:05.380 --> 00:48:06.380
Put this down, I think?

1030
00:48:06.513 --> 00:48:08.080
-Right, okay...
-Like this.


1031
00:48:08.213 --> 00:48:10.247
(mixer whirring)

1032
00:48:10.980 --> 00:48:12.413
Oops...

1033
00:48:12.547 --> 00:48:15.080
Did you just spew flour
all over me?


1034
00:48:15.213 --> 00:48:16.146
Sorry.

1035
00:48:17.447 --> 00:48:19.580
-Well... take that!
-Hey!


1036
00:48:21.780 --> 00:48:23.313
Oh, it's on now!

1037
00:48:24.580 --> 00:48:25.513
Oh yeah?

1038
00:48:27.247 --> 00:48:28.680
-Okay, truce?
-Okay, fine.


1039
00:48:33.647 --> 00:48:35.814
(laughing)

1040
00:48:42.247 --> 00:48:44.247
That was epic.

1041
00:48:44.380 --> 00:48:47.180
My grandma would have killed me
for running around the bakery.


1042
00:48:47.313 --> 00:48:48.580
Come on, it's good to
let off a little steam.


1043
00:48:48.714 --> 00:48:49.614
Yeah it is.

1044
00:48:49.747 --> 00:48:51.280
Plus, we got all the cakes done.

1045
00:48:51.413 --> 00:48:52.614
Well how about that?

1046
00:48:53.714 --> 00:48:57.247
I guess we should probably
start cleaning up, huh?


1047
00:48:57.380 --> 00:48:59.747
Suzanne's I'm sure getting
antsy right about now.


1048
00:48:59.946 --> 00:49:01.247
It's okay, let's just leave it.

1049
00:49:01.380 --> 00:49:02.447
I'll do it later.

1050
00:49:02.580 --> 00:49:06.647
Jessie, there's a category five
cake storm in there.


1051
00:49:06.780 --> 00:49:09.880
I've cleaned this place so many
times, I have a system.


1052
00:49:10.013 --> 00:49:11.247
It'll take me no time.

1053
00:49:11.380 --> 00:49:12.513
Seriously.

1054
00:49:12.647 --> 00:49:14.213
Okay, well thanks.

1055
00:49:18.714 --> 00:49:19.913
Before I go, I...

1056
00:49:22.614 --> 00:49:24.413
I just wanted to say,
thank you.


1057
00:49:24.547 --> 00:49:25.513
For what?

1058
00:49:26.880 --> 00:49:29.280
These past few years
have been really hard.


1059
00:49:29.413 --> 00:49:30.747
On me and Riley.

1060
00:49:30.880 --> 00:49:32.513
We haven't had a
whole lot of joy.


1061
00:49:32.647 --> 00:49:34.880
And this last week
has been full of it.


1062
00:49:36.513 --> 00:49:38.814
I've never seen
Riley this happy, so...


1063
00:49:39.814 --> 00:49:40.913
Thank you.

1064
00:49:41.046 --> 00:49:42.313
You're welcome.

1065
00:49:42.447 --> 00:49:43.580
And it's not just Riley.

1066
00:49:43.714 --> 00:49:44.680
It's me too.

1067
00:49:44.814 --> 00:49:46.313
After you came over
the other day,


1068
00:49:46.447 --> 00:49:48.614
it inspired me to get back
into my carpentry.


1069
00:49:48.747 --> 00:49:52.447
I hadn't been in there in years,
and now I can't leave.


1070
00:49:52.580 --> 00:49:53.847
I owe that to you.

1071
00:49:53.980 --> 00:49:56.380
I wanted to thank you, actually.

1072
00:49:56.513 --> 00:49:57.413
What did I do?

1073
00:49:58.847 --> 00:50:01.913
Owning your own business
can take over your life.


1074
00:50:02.046 --> 00:50:04.413
Everything falls on you.

1075
00:50:04.547 --> 00:50:05.847
It was really nice
doing something


1076
00:50:05.980 --> 00:50:07.413
totally different today.

1077
00:50:07.547 --> 00:50:09.480
And having someone else
be in charge.


1078
00:50:09.614 --> 00:50:11.180
So, thank you.

1079
00:50:12.413 --> 00:50:13.513
You're welcome.

1080
00:50:16.013 --> 00:50:17.580
Oh, umm...

1081
00:50:17.714 --> 00:50:18.913
You got a little something
on your nose--


1082
00:50:19.046 --> 00:50:19.780
What?

1083
00:50:19.913 --> 00:50:21.280
-Can I?
-Yes.


1084
00:50:21.413 --> 00:50:22.247
Okay.

1085
00:50:23.580 --> 00:50:24.413
Yup.

1086
00:50:26.380 --> 00:50:27.814
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.


1087
00:50:27.946 --> 00:50:29.714
We're doing a lot of
thanking each other tonight.


1088
00:50:29.847 --> 00:50:31.347
We really are.

1089
00:50:47.614 --> 00:50:48.913
I should go.

1090
00:50:50.313 --> 00:50:51.614
Okay.

1091
00:50:51.747 --> 00:50:53.313
I really don't want to.

1092
00:50:57.413 --> 00:50:58.413
Good night.

1093
00:50:58.547 --> 00:50:59.413
Night.

1094
00:51:15.480 --> 00:51:16.714
Oh gosh...

1095
00:51:29.780 --> 00:51:32.680
Free sample?
Chocolate? White berry?


1096
00:51:36.080 --> 00:51:37.680
I can't believe
how packed it is.


1097
00:51:37.814 --> 00:51:38.913
We're going to run out of cake.

1098
00:51:39.046 --> 00:51:41.247
You're going to raise the money,
Jessie, I just know it.


1099
00:51:41.380 --> 00:51:42.380
Thanks, Mom.

1100
00:51:42.513 --> 00:51:44.547
I should go check on Beatrice.

1101
00:51:44.680 --> 00:51:45.614
A free sample?

1102
00:51:45.747 --> 00:51:47.980
Try the coconut,
it's my favorite.


1103
00:51:48.113 --> 00:51:50.580
Welcome to Miriam's Sweet
Treats, how may I help you?


1104
00:51:53.847 --> 00:51:55.413
How's it going back here?

1105
00:51:55.547 --> 00:51:58.780
Robert here keeps eating
the cakes, so there's that.


1106
00:51:58.913 --> 00:52:00.946
Really Robbie,
pull yourself together.


1107
00:52:02.513 --> 00:52:03.913
I'm kidding, Robbie, relax.

1108
00:52:04.046 --> 00:52:05.680
He's not eating the cake.

1109
00:52:05.814 --> 00:52:07.013
Okay, good.

1110
00:52:12.580 --> 00:52:13.980
What's up with you?

1111
00:52:14.113 --> 00:52:15.380
What do you mean?

1112
00:52:15.513 --> 00:52:16.714
You're humming.

1113
00:52:16.847 --> 00:52:17.780
You never hum.

1114
00:52:18.680 --> 00:52:21.046
It's a beautiful day,
we're packed.


1115
00:52:21.180 --> 00:52:22.480
What's wrong with a good hum?

1116
00:52:22.614 --> 00:52:24.980
We're too stressed
right now for you--


1117
00:52:25.113 --> 00:52:26.046
The brother.

1118
00:52:26.180 --> 00:52:28.313
That's where you
were last night.


1119
00:52:28.447 --> 00:52:30.280
You kissed him, didn't you?

1120
00:52:30.413 --> 00:52:31.780
Didn't you?

1121
00:52:31.913 --> 00:52:32.747
No.

1122
00:52:32.880 --> 00:52:33.980
Yes you did!

1123
00:52:34.847 --> 00:52:35.714
Nah.

1124
00:52:35.847 --> 00:52:37.780
So help me, Jessie,
if you lie to me again--


1125
00:52:37.913 --> 00:52:38.880
Okay yes, fine, I did.

1126
00:52:39.013 --> 00:52:40.946
I knew it!

1127
00:52:41.080 --> 00:52:42.714
How was it?

1128
00:52:42.847 --> 00:52:44.380
It was okay.

1129
00:52:44.513 --> 00:52:45.946
Just okay?

1130
00:52:46.080 --> 00:52:47.447
Spill it, woman!

1131
00:52:47.580 --> 00:52:48.780
Guys...

1132
00:52:48.913 --> 00:52:49.913
We did it!

1133
00:52:50.046 --> 00:52:51.080
We did what?

1134
00:52:51.980 --> 00:52:53.747
I just got a call
from the bank...


1135
00:52:55.080 --> 00:52:57.013
We're approved for the loan!

1136
00:52:57.146 --> 00:52:58.880
Are you serious?

1137
00:52:59.013 --> 00:53:00.647
And between today's promotion

1138
00:53:00.780 --> 00:53:02.647
and the advance on the
additional Belson's orders,


1139
00:53:02.780 --> 00:53:03.880
we have enough
for a down payment.


1140
00:53:04.013 --> 00:53:05.380
More than enough!

1141
00:53:06.247 --> 00:53:07.747
-Oh my gosh!
-That's amazing!


1142
00:53:09.013 --> 00:53:11.046
We can put in an offer tomorrow
when the listing goes live.


1143
00:53:11.180 --> 00:53:12.847
Are you ready?

1144
00:53:12.980 --> 00:53:16.080
I've never been more ready
for anything in my life!


1145
00:53:17.046 --> 00:53:18.380
I'll make the call.

1146
00:53:19.480 --> 00:53:21.980
Everything is
falling into place.


1147
00:53:22.113 --> 00:53:23.413
I can't believe it!

1148
00:53:23.547 --> 00:53:24.580
You deserve it.

1149
00:53:24.714 --> 00:53:25.780
Thank you!

1150
00:53:25.913 --> 00:53:28.013
I don't know what I would have
done without you, Howard.


1151
00:53:28.146 --> 00:53:29.380
Seriously!

1152
00:53:30.080 --> 00:53:31.113
You're welcome.

1153
00:53:32.547 --> 00:53:33.380
(throat clearing)

1154
00:53:33.513 --> 00:53:35.013
And you too, Beatrice.

1155
00:53:35.146 --> 00:53:37.413
You have gone
above and beyond.


1156
00:53:37.547 --> 00:53:38.747
You are incredible.

1157
00:53:38.880 --> 00:53:40.046
Well, you know.

1158
00:53:40.180 --> 00:53:41.780
I do kind of like the place.

1159
00:53:44.180 --> 00:53:45.146
I have to go meet someone.

1160
00:53:45.280 --> 00:53:47.413
Do you guys mind if
I take off a little early?


1161
00:53:47.547 --> 00:53:50.480
Does someone's name happen
to rhyme with Shmadan?


1162
00:53:51.580 --> 00:53:52.680
Maybe...

1163
00:53:52.814 --> 00:53:53.847
Go for it, girl.

1164
00:53:55.013 --> 00:53:58.847
I don't know what you guys
are talking about, but...


1165
00:53:58.980 --> 00:53:59.780
Have fun!

1166
00:53:59.980 --> 00:54:00.913
Thank you.

1167
00:54:01.046 --> 00:54:02.480
I will see you guys tomorrow.

1168
00:54:02.614 --> 00:54:04.113
And call me if
you hear anything.


1169
00:54:04.247 --> 00:54:05.180
Anything at all!

1170
00:54:05.313 --> 00:54:06.480
Will do!

1171
00:54:09.847 --> 00:54:10.780
(high five)
-Yes!


1172
00:54:13.313 --> 00:54:14.814
We really had fun last night.

1173
00:54:14.946 --> 00:54:15.880
Me too.

1174
00:54:17.313 --> 00:54:19.814
So, when are you putting
in the big offer?


1175
00:54:19.946 --> 00:54:21.447
First thing tomorrow.

1176
00:54:21.580 --> 00:54:23.780
Jessie, that's incredible.

1177
00:54:23.913 --> 00:54:25.080
When do you think
you'll find out?


1178
00:54:25.213 --> 00:54:26.780
We should know by
end of day tomorrow,


1179
00:54:26.913 --> 00:54:30.013
but our realtor thinks
our offer is the best.


1180
00:54:30.146 --> 00:54:31.547
Wow, I'm so happy for you.

1181
00:54:31.680 --> 00:54:33.780
It's not a done deal,
but yeah,


1182
00:54:33.913 --> 00:54:35.113
I'm really happy, too.

1183
00:54:35.247 --> 00:54:37.780
I just can't believe
we pulled it off.


1184
00:54:37.913 --> 00:54:38.913
I knew you would.

1185
00:54:39.913 --> 00:54:41.780
I'm meeting your
sister tomorrow too.


1186
00:54:41.913 --> 00:54:44.046
Last one before the wedding.

1187
00:54:44.180 --> 00:54:45.913
Hard to believe the
wedding's in a week, huh?


1188
00:54:46.046 --> 00:54:48.447
I need to get started
on her cake.


1189
00:54:48.580 --> 00:54:49.780
I've been meaning
to ask you something.


1190
00:54:49.913 --> 00:54:51.013
What's that?

1191
00:54:51.146 --> 00:54:54.113
Would you be my date
to Suzanne's wedding?


1192
00:54:54.247 --> 00:54:55.413
Really?

1193
00:54:55.547 --> 00:54:56.614
You want me to come?

1194
00:54:56.747 --> 00:54:58.180
I'd love nothing
more in the world.


1195
00:55:00.146 --> 00:55:03.580
I'd love to be your date
to Suzanne's wedding.


1196
00:55:03.714 --> 00:55:04.880
-Great.
-Great.


1197
00:55:14.213 --> 00:55:16.046
And then, of course,
we will finish it off


1198
00:55:16.180 --> 00:55:18.614
with the baby blue flowers
to match your color scheme.


1199
00:55:20.380 --> 00:55:21.880
It's wonderful.

1200
00:55:22.013 --> 00:55:23.814
Just perfect.

1201
00:55:23.946 --> 00:55:25.747
Everything I ever dreamed of.

1202
00:55:27.113 --> 00:55:29.013
I can't wait to see it.

1203
00:55:29.146 --> 00:55:31.480
Well, I can't wait to make it.

1204
00:55:31.614 --> 00:55:35.547
It's bigger than I've ever done,
but I love a challenge.


1205
00:55:35.680 --> 00:55:37.814
Keeps things interesting.

1206
00:55:37.946 --> 00:55:39.880
I have something for you.

1207
00:55:40.013 --> 00:55:40.880
For me?

1208
00:55:41.780 --> 00:55:42.614
Come.

1209
00:55:48.380 --> 00:55:49.647
Ta-da!

1210
00:55:53.747 --> 00:55:54.913
Is this for me?

1211
00:55:55.046 --> 00:55:56.213
For the wedding.

1212
00:55:56.347 --> 00:55:58.680
Aidan told me you're coming.

1213
00:55:59.614 --> 00:56:01.013
It's beautiful.

1214
00:56:01.913 --> 00:56:03.046
Thank you!

1215
00:56:03.180 --> 00:56:07.647
I almost went with pistachio,
but that's not your color.


1216
00:56:07.780 --> 00:56:10.113
I'd wear hot pink if it was
a Suzanne Cooper design.


1217
00:56:10.247 --> 00:56:13.046
Oh no, no hot pink for you.

1218
00:56:13.180 --> 00:56:14.780
Oh, okay. I won't.

1219
00:56:15.880 --> 00:56:17.647
I keep meaning to ask,

1220
00:56:17.780 --> 00:56:19.080
what's happening
with your building?


1221
00:56:19.213 --> 00:56:22.313
Oh, we actually put in
an offer this morning.


1222
00:56:22.447 --> 00:56:23.946
I think we have a good shot.

1223
00:56:24.080 --> 00:56:26.080
That's really great to hear.

1224
00:56:26.213 --> 00:56:27.146
Thanks.

1225
00:56:27.980 --> 00:56:29.647
(phone ringing)

1226
00:56:29.780 --> 00:56:31.547
This actually might be the news.

1227
00:56:31.680 --> 00:56:33.313
Do you mind if I take it?

1228
00:56:33.447 --> 00:56:35.580
By all means.

1229
00:56:35.714 --> 00:56:36.913
Howard, what's up?

1230
00:56:37.046 --> 00:56:38.946
Give me some good news, baby.

1231
00:56:40.146 --> 00:56:42.046
I'm sorry, Jessie,
they went with another offer.


1232
00:56:42.180 --> 00:56:43.213
What?

1233
00:56:43.347 --> 00:56:44.313
How could they?

1234
00:56:44.447 --> 00:56:48.146
The other buyer is related
to the seller's realtor.


1235
00:56:48.280 --> 00:56:50.280
We didn't stand a chance.

1236
00:56:50.413 --> 00:56:52.013
Can we go back?

1237
00:56:52.146 --> 00:56:52.980
Offer more?

1238
00:56:53.113 --> 00:56:55.280
The deal's done, it's too late.

1239
00:56:56.380 --> 00:56:58.046
Is it a developer?

1240
00:56:58.180 --> 00:57:01.247
Some realty company, I think.

1241
00:57:01.380 --> 00:57:02.880
Oceanside Realty.

1242
00:57:04.780 --> 00:57:06.247
They're turning it into
their new headquarters.


1243
00:57:06.380 --> 00:57:09.113
They'll be moving in as soon
as the deal closes.


1244
00:57:09.247 --> 00:57:10.946
So the bakery's done?

1245
00:57:11.913 --> 00:57:15.013
It's a setback,
but we're not done.


1246
00:57:18.180 --> 00:57:19.714
Thanks for letting me know.

1247
00:57:19.847 --> 00:57:21.313
I'm so sorry, Jessie.

1248
00:57:38.280 --> 00:57:39.180
It's over.

1249
00:57:40.313 --> 00:57:41.780
I'm sorry, hon.

1250
00:57:44.447 --> 00:57:47.280
I don't get it,
we were so close.


1251
00:57:48.814 --> 00:57:50.080
If they'd just
given us a chance


1252
00:57:50.213 --> 00:57:52.880
to go back in with
a higher offer.


1253
00:57:53.013 --> 00:57:54.880
Who's the buyer?

1254
00:57:55.013 --> 00:57:56.680
Some real estate company.

1255
00:57:57.413 --> 00:58:00.413
Oceanside Realty,
I think he said.


1256
00:58:01.313 --> 00:58:02.213
Oh, dear.

1257
00:58:05.013 --> 00:58:05.847
What?

1258
00:58:28.113 --> 00:58:30.280
(machine whirring)

1259
00:58:36.313 --> 00:58:37.880
You bought my building?

1260
00:58:38.013 --> 00:58:39.113
Hey, Jessie!

1261
00:58:41.080 --> 00:58:42.113
Sorry I couldn't hear you,
what's that?


1262
00:58:42.247 --> 00:58:43.280
You bought my building!

1263
00:58:43.413 --> 00:58:44.380
What are you talking about?

1264
00:58:44.513 --> 00:58:45.980
Oh please, spare me.

1265
00:58:46.113 --> 00:58:48.180
You sat there and you
watched us work,


1266
00:58:48.313 --> 00:58:51.280
and push, and struggle,
and you kissed me,


1267
00:58:51.413 --> 00:58:53.280
and the whole time you knew
that your company


1268
00:58:53.413 --> 00:58:55.413
was about to ruin my life.

1269
00:58:55.547 --> 00:58:57.213
Whoa Jessie, back up.

1270
00:58:57.347 --> 00:58:59.213
You showed me who you were
the first night.


1271
00:58:59.347 --> 00:59:00.946
Company man,
through and through.


1272
00:59:01.080 --> 00:59:03.380
Too scared to choose
his heart over his head.


1273
00:59:03.513 --> 00:59:04.946
I don't know what
you're talking about.


1274
00:59:05.080 --> 00:59:06.780
Well congratulations, Aidan.

1275
00:59:06.913 --> 00:59:08.880
Your company got
a great location


1276
00:59:09.013 --> 00:59:10.814
right in the center
of Main Street.


1277
00:59:10.946 --> 00:59:14.080
I hope you got a big commission,
and I hope you're happy.


1278
00:59:14.213 --> 00:59:15.113
What?

1279
00:59:16.580 --> 00:59:17.513
Jessie!

1280
00:59:28.680 --> 00:59:30.146
(phone dialing)

1281
00:59:33.046 --> 00:59:34.313
Hey, Dave.

1282
00:59:34.447 --> 00:59:36.880
I'm a little confused over here,
did we purchase--


1283
00:59:40.080 --> 00:59:40.980
Right.

1284
00:59:41.113 --> 00:59:42.113
Uh-huh.

1285
00:59:43.180 --> 00:59:45.013
No, I just thought you
were gonna...


1286
00:59:46.380 --> 00:59:47.913
Yeah, no...

1287
00:59:48.046 --> 00:59:49.313
I'll see you Monday.

1288
00:59:54.513 --> 00:59:56.880
I can't believe Aidan
did that to you.


1289
00:59:57.013 --> 00:59:59.046
It doesn't even make any sense.

1290
01:00:00.113 --> 01:00:00.880
It's pretty cold.

1291
01:00:01.013 --> 01:00:02.080
Did he even explain himself?

1292
01:00:02.213 --> 01:00:04.814
There's nothing he can say
that can make this better.


1293
01:00:04.946 --> 01:00:06.513
You're not even
a little bit curious?


1294
01:00:06.647 --> 01:00:08.847
Aidan's not the guy
I thought he was.


1295
01:00:08.980 --> 01:00:11.113
I don't ever want
to talk to him again.


1296
01:00:13.413 --> 01:00:15.080
What are we going to do now?

1297
01:00:15.213 --> 01:00:16.113
Honestly?

1298
01:00:17.146 --> 01:00:18.313
I don't know.

1299
01:00:21.213 --> 01:00:23.046
It's been a rough day.

1300
01:00:24.146 --> 01:00:25.447
Let's get some sleep.

1301
01:00:25.580 --> 01:00:28.180
Tomorrow, we'll
figure out a game plan.


1302
01:00:29.580 --> 01:00:30.447
Okay?

1303
01:00:32.247 --> 01:00:33.080
Okay.

1304
01:00:35.946 --> 01:00:37.580
-Yeah.
-Okay.


1305
01:00:46.513 --> 01:00:49.313
Dad, can we go see
Jessie tonight?


1306
01:00:49.447 --> 01:00:51.313
I don't know hon,
I think she might be busy.


1307
01:00:51.447 --> 01:00:53.946
Why's she so busy?
What is she doing?


1308
01:00:54.080 --> 01:00:56.180
Well, she's moving.

1309
01:00:56.313 --> 01:00:58.013
She's baking your aunt's
wedding cake.


1310
01:00:58.146 --> 01:00:59.313
Oh...

1311
01:00:59.447 --> 01:01:02.013
Maybe she needs help
if she's so busy.


1312
01:01:02.146 --> 01:01:04.447
Maybe we should go visit her.

1313
01:01:04.580 --> 01:01:06.247
It's already past your bedtime.

1314
01:01:06.380 --> 01:01:07.913
Dad!

1315
01:01:08.046 --> 01:01:10.013
Sorry, let's go
brush your teeth.


1316
01:01:33.447 --> 01:01:35.313
(phone vibrating)

1317
01:01:51.247 --> 01:01:52.180
Jessie?

1318
01:01:54.213 --> 01:01:55.547
(knocking)

1319
01:01:55.680 --> 01:01:56.580
Jessie!

1320
01:02:04.347 --> 01:02:05.247
Jessie!

1321
01:02:19.146 --> 01:02:21.080
Please just let me explain.

1322
01:02:32.313 --> 01:02:33.580
Jessie, I had--

1323
01:02:33.714 --> 01:02:35.247
Honestly, Aidan...

1324
01:02:36.280 --> 01:02:39.213
there's nothing you can
say that can fix this.


1325
01:02:39.347 --> 01:02:40.547
Even if you're sorry,

1326
01:02:40.680 --> 01:02:43.513
even if somehow this
isn't your fault...


1327
01:02:45.347 --> 01:02:46.647
None of it matters anymore.

1328
01:02:49.347 --> 01:02:52.013
If you really care
about me, please...


1329
01:02:52.146 --> 01:02:53.447
Just leave me alone.

1330
01:02:56.380 --> 01:02:57.413
Do you really mean that?

1331
01:02:59.080 --> 01:03:00.113
Yes.

1332
01:03:05.513 --> 01:03:07.080
If that's what you want.

1333
01:03:37.747 --> 01:03:39.113
I'm sorry, grandma.

1334
01:03:40.113 --> 01:03:40.714
I tried.

1335
01:03:40.847 --> 01:03:41.780
I really did.

1336
01:03:45.513 --> 01:03:47.580
We're gonna find a new place.

1337
01:03:47.714 --> 01:03:49.513
And it's gonna be great.

1338
01:03:50.780 --> 01:03:51.747
I don't know.

1339
01:03:53.647 --> 01:03:55.580
We're going to get through this.

1340
01:03:55.714 --> 01:03:56.780
Together.

1341
01:03:58.814 --> 01:04:00.080
Yeah.

1342
01:04:00.213 --> 01:04:01.614
Alright...

1343
01:04:01.747 --> 01:04:05.080
I found a ton of interesting
spaces to check out.


1344
01:04:05.213 --> 01:04:07.814
The good news is we have
a bunch of money to spend.


1345
01:04:07.946 --> 01:04:09.080
Jessie, you want
to come with me?


1346
01:04:09.213 --> 01:04:11.714
Beatrice, you can get started
on Suzanne's wedding cake.


1347
01:04:11.847 --> 01:04:14.113
Honestly Howard,
I don't think I can.


1348
01:04:15.180 --> 01:04:17.146
Can what?
Check out spaces?


1349
01:04:17.280 --> 01:04:18.647
That's okay, what's your
schedule like tomorrow?


1350
01:04:18.780 --> 01:04:22.080
No I mean, I don't
think I can move.


1351
01:04:26.913 --> 01:04:28.280
What are you saying?

1352
01:04:28.413 --> 01:04:29.513
You want to shut down?

1353
01:04:29.647 --> 01:04:30.680
You can't do that!

1354
01:04:30.814 --> 01:04:32.046
I'm not saying that.

1355
01:04:32.180 --> 01:04:34.814
I just need more time
to think about it.


1356
01:04:34.946 --> 01:04:36.580
The clock is ticking,
Jessie.


1357
01:04:36.714 --> 01:04:37.780
I know!

1358
01:04:37.913 --> 01:04:40.080
I'm still in shock,
that's all.


1359
01:04:40.946 --> 01:04:43.213
I'm not ready to look
at places yet.


1360
01:04:44.680 --> 01:04:46.280
Well, I'm going.

1361
01:04:46.413 --> 01:04:48.714
You can do what you want.

1362
01:04:48.847 --> 01:04:50.280
I'll finish Suzanne's cake.

1363
01:04:50.413 --> 01:04:52.580
Beatrice, why don't
you go with Howard?


1364
01:04:52.714 --> 01:04:53.680
You sure?

1365
01:04:54.614 --> 01:04:55.547
Yeah.

1366
01:05:07.347 --> 01:05:08.580
Aidan, Riley!

1367
01:05:08.714 --> 01:05:09.814
Hello there.

1368
01:05:09.946 --> 01:05:11.814
Wow, this looks incredible,
Suzanne.


1369
01:05:13.380 --> 01:05:14.380
Doesn't it?

1370
01:05:15.980 --> 01:05:17.313
What are you doing here?

1371
01:05:17.447 --> 01:05:19.447
Well, we brought you a gift.

1372
01:05:20.513 --> 01:05:21.513
You did?

1373
01:05:21.647 --> 01:05:22.780
It's in the truck.

1374
01:05:25.647 --> 01:05:26.647
How are you?

1375
01:05:38.647 --> 01:05:40.146
It's an arch.

1376
01:05:40.280 --> 01:05:41.247
For your wedding.

1377
01:05:41.380 --> 01:05:42.313
It's so beautiful.

1378
01:05:43.313 --> 01:05:44.313
I love it.

1379
01:05:45.547 --> 01:05:46.413
Thank you.

1380
01:05:46.547 --> 01:05:47.647
You're welcome.

1381
01:05:50.447 --> 01:05:52.614
So, how'd your talk
with Jessie go?


1382
01:05:54.280 --> 01:05:55.247
It didn't.

1383
01:05:55.380 --> 01:05:57.580
I mean I tried, she just
didn't want to hear it.


1384
01:05:57.714 --> 01:05:58.847
She's hurting.

1385
01:05:58.980 --> 01:06:00.946
The thing that means more to her
than anything in the world


1386
01:06:01.080 --> 01:06:03.313
has been razed to the ground.

1387
01:06:03.447 --> 01:06:04.447
I know.

1388
01:06:06.413 --> 01:06:08.213
I don't know what to do.

1389
01:06:08.347 --> 01:06:11.747
Well, how can you help
her build it back up again?


1390
01:06:16.880 --> 01:06:19.347
Hey, how'd it go?

1391
01:06:19.480 --> 01:06:20.714
It was great.

1392
01:06:20.847 --> 01:06:22.714
We found some
really good options.


1393
01:06:22.847 --> 01:06:23.747
It was exciting.

1394
01:06:23.880 --> 01:06:26.480
You should really
check these places out.


1395
01:06:26.614 --> 01:06:29.747
Might make you feel
better about moving.


1396
01:06:30.780 --> 01:06:31.647
Maybe.

1397
01:06:34.780 --> 01:06:36.313
You want to get out of here?

1398
01:06:36.447 --> 01:06:37.413
I can close up.

1399
01:06:38.480 --> 01:06:41.614
Nah, I'm kind of on a roll
with Suzanne's cake.


1400
01:06:44.880 --> 01:06:45.747
Alright.

1401
01:06:46.747 --> 01:06:47.780
Good night!

1402
01:07:04.146 --> 01:07:06.747
Do you really think
she'd give this place up?


1403
01:07:08.747 --> 01:07:11.814
I didn't think so,
but now I'm not so sure.


1404
01:07:11.946 --> 01:07:14.280
We're like family.

1405
01:07:14.413 --> 01:07:16.413
I can't imagine working
without you guys.


1406
01:07:16.547 --> 01:07:18.780
Well, don't worry.

1407
01:07:18.913 --> 01:07:20.847
Because I called in
the big guns.


1408
01:07:20.980 --> 01:07:22.046
Who's that?

1409
01:07:23.380 --> 01:07:24.447
Her mom.

1410
01:07:25.413 --> 01:07:26.413
Savage.

1411
01:07:26.547 --> 01:07:29.580
Hey, desperate times call
for desperate measures.


1412
01:07:29.714 --> 01:07:32.247
You're a diabolical
genius, Howard,


1413
01:07:32.380 --> 01:07:34.013
and I love you for it.

1414
01:07:40.880 --> 01:07:42.714
(knocking)

1415
01:07:47.580 --> 01:07:48.447
Mom?

1416
01:07:53.513 --> 01:07:55.080
What are you doing here?

1417
01:07:57.080 --> 01:07:58.747
I heard about the offer.

1418
01:07:58.880 --> 01:08:00.680
I'm sorry, honey.

1419
01:08:00.814 --> 01:08:02.680
I just can't believe it.

1420
01:08:14.780 --> 01:08:16.580
It's not the end of the world.

1421
01:08:16.714 --> 01:08:19.647
You can get this place
back on its feet.


1422
01:08:19.780 --> 01:08:21.380
You're not disappointed in me?

1423
01:08:21.513 --> 01:08:23.447
This was your mom's bakery.

1424
01:08:23.580 --> 01:08:24.680
And I lost it.

1425
01:08:24.814 --> 01:08:26.714
I could never be
disappointed in you.


1426
01:08:26.847 --> 01:08:28.614
I know how much
you love the bakery.


1427
01:08:28.747 --> 01:08:29.780
But I lost it.

1428
01:08:30.913 --> 01:08:32.113
Grandma loved this place.

1429
01:08:32.247 --> 01:08:33.847
Oh, honey...

1430
01:08:33.980 --> 01:08:36.447
Don't you know that grandma
didn't love the bakery?


1431
01:08:36.580 --> 01:08:37.880
She loved baking.

1432
01:08:38.013 --> 01:08:38.814
Bringing people together,

1433
01:08:38.946 --> 01:08:41.647
spending time with
her granddaughter.


1434
01:08:41.780 --> 01:08:43.680
The place the baking
happens doesn't matter,


1435
01:08:43.814 --> 01:08:45.680
it's the baking itself.

1436
01:08:45.814 --> 01:08:47.780
It's the love that goes into it

1437
01:08:47.913 --> 01:08:50.113
and the people you bake
with that matter.


1438
01:08:51.180 --> 01:08:53.380
Your passion for baking
will always connect you


1439
01:08:53.513 --> 01:08:54.714
to your grandma.

1440
01:08:54.847 --> 01:08:55.747
I know.

1441
01:08:56.647 --> 01:08:57.647
Thanks, Mom.

1442
01:08:58.880 --> 01:09:00.780
I want to show you
another picture.


1443
01:09:00.913 --> 01:09:03.946
Mom I've seen all of these,
they're from when I was little.


1444
01:09:04.080 --> 01:09:05.580
No, I don't think
this one you have.


1445
01:09:05.714 --> 01:09:06.980
Take a closer look...

1446
01:09:08.213 --> 01:09:09.547
Wait, what is this?

1447
01:09:10.847 --> 01:09:15.247
This is opening day
of the bakery in 1940.


1448
01:09:16.647 --> 01:09:19.180
Miriam's Sweet Treats
opened in 1955,


1449
01:09:19.313 --> 01:09:21.180
when grandma was
in her twenties.


1450
01:09:21.313 --> 01:09:23.480
She's what, like 10 here?

1451
01:09:23.614 --> 01:09:25.480
And why does the building
look so different?


1452
01:09:25.614 --> 01:09:27.213
It's not Miriam's Sweet Treats.

1453
01:09:27.347 --> 01:09:30.847
It's the original bakery
your great grandma opened.


1454
01:09:30.980 --> 01:09:33.046
Florrie's Bake Shop,
it was across town.


1455
01:09:33.180 --> 01:09:34.847
Florrie's Bake Shop?

1456
01:09:34.980 --> 01:09:37.146
Grandma never mentioned that,
how did I not know that?


1457
01:09:38.146 --> 01:09:40.213
Florrie was the first person
in our family


1458
01:09:40.347 --> 01:09:42.146
to open a bakery.

1459
01:09:42.280 --> 01:09:44.447
It was World War II, and...

1460
01:09:44.580 --> 01:09:46.513
the economy wasn't that great,
but...


1461
01:09:46.647 --> 01:09:47.747
She was adored in
her neighborhood,


1462
01:09:47.880 --> 01:09:49.647
so she managed okay.

1463
01:09:49.780 --> 01:09:52.146
When the war was over,
the economy boomed,


1464
01:09:52.280 --> 01:09:54.946
but Florrie's little

1465
01:09:55.080 --> 01:09:57.080
wasn't doing as well
as it should have been.


1466
01:09:58.180 --> 01:10:00.647
Prices went up,
the neighborhood changed,


1467
01:10:00.780 --> 01:10:02.913
her regular customers
started dying out.


1468
01:10:03.046 --> 01:10:05.547
She just couldn't keep up.

1469
01:10:05.680 --> 01:10:07.946
So when your grandma
Miriam took it over,


1470
01:10:08.080 --> 01:10:09.847
she knew she had to make
some drastic changes.


1471
01:10:09.980 --> 01:10:11.814
So she moved it to
Main Street, here,


1472
01:10:11.946 --> 01:10:13.880
Because it was up
and coming at the time.


1473
01:10:14.013 --> 01:10:16.714
She updated the look,
renamed it.


1474
01:10:16.847 --> 01:10:19.747
She created
Miriam's Sweet Treats.


1475
01:10:19.880 --> 01:10:21.046
And it thrived.

1476
01:10:22.313 --> 01:10:24.580
How did I not know this?

1477
01:10:25.780 --> 01:10:29.113
You need to make
Miriam's Sweet Treats your own.


1478
01:10:29.247 --> 01:10:30.580
I know how much
you loved grandma.


1479
01:10:30.714 --> 01:10:33.013
And I know how much
you care about the bakery,


1480
01:10:33.146 --> 01:10:36.146
but you need to make
something that's yours.


1481
01:10:37.247 --> 01:10:40.814
We can keep our past
in our hearts


1482
01:10:40.946 --> 01:10:44.513
and carry it around with us,
but we can't cling to it.


1483
01:10:44.647 --> 01:10:45.980
It's what your grandma
would have done.


1484
01:10:49.146 --> 01:10:50.247
You're right.

1485
01:10:50.380 --> 01:10:54.213
You have a blank slate,
you can do whatever you want.


1486
01:10:55.680 --> 01:10:57.913
Who is Jessie Dale?

1487
01:10:58.046 --> 01:10:59.180
What does she want?

1488
01:11:09.714 --> 01:11:11.814
All right, you gotta do it
just like this, okay?


1489
01:11:11.946 --> 01:11:12.880
What do you think?

1490
01:11:13.213 --> 01:11:14.080
Whoa, cool.

1491
01:11:15.146 --> 01:11:16.080
Right?

1492
01:11:18.347 --> 01:11:20.547
Whoa, what are those?

1493
01:11:20.680 --> 01:11:22.180
For the wedding...

1494
01:11:22.313 --> 01:11:25.080
There is no pink
at my wedding.


1495
01:11:25.213 --> 01:11:27.080
That's not what
the florist delivered.


1496
01:11:27.213 --> 01:11:30.113
I've got 40 pounds
of pink peonies.


1497
01:11:30.247 --> 01:11:32.113
I didn't order pink peonies!

1498
01:11:32.247 --> 01:11:35.647
I ordered Himalayan blue poppies
imported from Oregon!


1499
01:11:35.780 --> 01:11:37.046
They're very challenging to grow

1500
01:11:37.180 --> 01:11:39.847
and they're even more
challenging to keep alive!


1501
01:11:39.980 --> 01:11:42.614
It's called theme, people!

1502
01:11:42.747 --> 01:11:43.747
Theme!

1503
01:11:43.880 --> 01:11:45.080
Pink peonies.

1504
01:11:45.213 --> 01:11:48.680
I mean, has anyone here
even heard of a metaphor?


1505
01:11:50.747 --> 01:11:51.614
Huh?

1506
01:11:51.747 --> 01:11:55.547
So what do you want us to do?

1507
01:11:55.680 --> 01:11:58.213
Get them out of here!

1508
01:11:58.347 --> 01:12:00.946
Okay... take 'em back!

1509
01:12:01.080 --> 01:12:01.980
Load it up!

1510
01:12:07.280 --> 01:12:10.847
What is the deal with
the pink peonies?


1511
01:12:12.480 --> 01:12:16.013
Wouldn't want to be the other
person on that call.


1512
01:12:16.146 --> 01:12:17.614
Me neither.

1513
01:12:19.113 --> 01:12:20.046
Your turn.

1514
01:12:20.547 --> 01:12:21.046
Here we go.

1515
01:12:22.580 --> 01:12:23.513
Here you go.

1516
01:12:23.647 --> 01:12:24.080
Yeah!

1517
01:12:24.213 --> 01:12:24.714
Whoa!

1518
01:12:24.847 --> 01:12:25.714
You're so good!

1519
01:12:51.980 --> 01:12:53.580
That looks great!

1520
01:12:53.714 --> 01:12:55.580
You must have been up all night!

1521
01:12:55.714 --> 01:12:56.747
I couldn't sleep.

1522
01:12:56.880 --> 01:12:58.747
Figured I might as well finish.

1523
01:12:58.880 --> 01:13:00.780
Now she just needs
to get dressed up.


1524
01:13:00.913 --> 01:13:02.847
Well, I'm about to go on
another scouting trip.


1525
01:13:02.980 --> 01:13:04.013
Beatrice, you want to come?

1526
01:13:04.146 --> 01:13:06.980
Actually, I think
I'd like to go.


1527
01:13:09.046 --> 01:13:10.313
-You would?
-Yeah.


1528
01:13:10.447 --> 01:13:12.280
I'd like to see
what my options are.


1529
01:13:13.347 --> 01:13:15.046
That's a great idea, let's go.

1530
01:13:15.180 --> 01:13:17.280
I think I'd like to go alone.

1531
01:13:18.814 --> 01:13:20.046
What about the cake?

1532
01:13:20.180 --> 01:13:21.714
The wedding's tomorrow.

1533
01:13:22.946 --> 01:13:23.913
Why don't you get started?

1534
01:13:24.880 --> 01:13:26.013
I trust you.

1535
01:13:28.513 --> 01:13:30.247
And could you go to the bank

1536
01:13:30.380 --> 01:13:32.714
and make sure all our
documents in order?


1537
01:13:32.847 --> 01:13:33.714
Are you sure?

1538
01:13:34.946 --> 01:13:35.714
I'm sure.

1539
01:13:35.847 --> 01:13:38.347
You don't like the way
I decorate.


1540
01:13:39.413 --> 01:13:41.946
The way you do it
is perfect, Beatrice.


1541
01:13:50.313 --> 01:13:52.847
[phone ringing]

1542
01:13:57.480 --> 01:13:58.880
Miriam's Sweet Treats?

1543
01:13:59.013 --> 01:14:00.013
The poppies are not coming.

1544
01:14:00.146 --> 01:14:02.046
They brought
pink peonies instead!


1545
01:14:02.180 --> 01:14:03.980
Can you believe it?
This is a complete disaster!


1546
01:14:04.113 --> 01:14:05.913
There are no poppies,
and I don't know what--


1547
01:14:06.046 --> 01:14:07.146
Whoa, slow down.

1548
01:14:07.280 --> 01:14:10.447
I can't understand you.

1549
01:14:10.580 --> 01:14:12.413
The poppies... what?

1550
01:14:12.547 --> 01:14:14.780
The poppies are now
pink peonies!


1551
01:14:21.980 --> 01:14:23.313
[phone ringing]

1552
01:14:24.247 --> 01:14:25.180
Hey B, what's up?

1553
01:14:25.313 --> 01:14:27.380
Oh, thank goodness
you picked up!


1554
01:14:27.513 --> 01:14:30.413
Suzanne is having a meltdown
and you need to go over there.


1555
01:14:30.547 --> 01:14:32.146
Slow down, what's wrong?

1556
01:14:32.280 --> 01:14:33.847
I don't know, I couldn't
really understand her.


1557
01:14:33.980 --> 01:14:36.913
Something about ducks
in Nebraska?


1558
01:14:38.113 --> 01:14:41.046
Or... peonies!
I don't know...


1559
01:14:41.180 --> 01:14:42.313
I'll handle this.

1560
01:14:51.913 --> 01:14:52.814
Suzanne?

1561
01:14:56.146 --> 01:14:58.280
I got your message,
is this about the peonies?


1562
01:15:03.046 --> 01:15:06.146
You really wanted the
blue poppies, didn't you?


1563
01:15:06.280 --> 01:15:08.313
They had special meaning.

1564
01:15:10.280 --> 01:15:12.347
My whole wedding is blue.

1565
01:15:14.146 --> 01:15:17.447
Not to mention my entire line
for next season.


1566
01:15:17.580 --> 01:15:20.513
Sucks when things don't go
the way you planned.


1567
01:15:20.647 --> 01:15:22.180
I know that firsthand.

1568
01:15:24.946 --> 01:15:26.213
But you know...

1569
01:15:26.347 --> 01:15:29.447
I did a little research on
peonies on my way over here.


1570
01:15:29.580 --> 01:15:33.013
Did you know that they only
flower 7-10 days a year?


1571
01:15:33.946 --> 01:15:36.980
7-10 days out of
the entire year.


1572
01:15:37.113 --> 01:15:38.213
-Really?
-Really!


1573
01:15:40.980 --> 01:15:42.247
Well that's pretty special...

1574
01:15:42.380 --> 01:15:44.347
That's very special!

1575
01:15:44.480 --> 01:15:47.913
Peonies will only be in bloom
during the week of your wedding.


1576
01:15:48.046 --> 01:15:50.013
Not before, not after.

1577
01:15:50.146 --> 01:15:52.380
I do like the symbolism there.

1578
01:15:52.513 --> 01:15:53.447
Right?

1579
01:15:54.447 --> 01:15:56.180
And 7-10 days?

1580
01:15:56.313 --> 01:15:59.313
That's as often as Evan
and I see each other,


1581
01:15:59.447 --> 01:16:01.946
given our crazy work schedules.

1582
01:16:02.080 --> 01:16:04.113
So that's a good metaphor.

1583
01:16:04.247 --> 01:16:05.547
I agree.

1584
01:16:05.680 --> 01:16:07.280
But pink!

1585
01:16:08.380 --> 01:16:10.547
With all the blue
we already have...


1586
01:16:10.680 --> 01:16:13.080
I thought about that.

1587
01:16:13.213 --> 01:16:16.547
What do you get when you put
pink and blue together?


1588
01:16:16.680 --> 01:16:17.946
Paternal twins?

1589
01:16:18.714 --> 01:16:20.080
I'm serious, Suzanne!

1590
01:16:23.614 --> 01:16:24.447
Lavender.

1591
01:16:25.380 --> 01:16:26.213
Lavender!

1592
01:16:28.680 --> 01:16:31.280
We just put some touches
of lavender here and there,


1593
01:16:31.413 --> 01:16:33.447
and with the blue you already
have for the wedding,


1594
01:16:33.580 --> 01:16:36.080
plus the pink peonies, viola!

1595
01:16:36.213 --> 01:16:37.313
Wedding saved!

1596
01:16:39.180 --> 01:16:40.447
I do like that...

1597
01:16:42.347 --> 01:16:45.880
It's sort of got a
unicorn thing going on, and...


1598
01:16:46.013 --> 01:16:47.447
they're very rare, too!

1599
01:16:47.580 --> 01:16:50.146
Actually, I think
they're fictional, but...


1600
01:16:50.280 --> 01:16:51.213
Yeah!

1601
01:16:53.714 --> 01:16:54.614
Thanks, Jessie.

1602
01:16:55.580 --> 01:16:56.880
I really love this.

1603
01:16:57.013 --> 01:16:57.946
You're welcome.

1604
01:17:01.814 --> 01:17:03.647
Aidan told me what happened.

1605
01:17:05.680 --> 01:17:07.747
Did you know that
he quit his job?


1606
01:17:09.380 --> 01:17:11.313
Why would he do that?

1607
01:17:11.447 --> 01:17:13.413
His boss lied to him.

1608
01:17:13.547 --> 01:17:15.247
He took all the information
about the listing


1609
01:17:15.380 --> 01:17:18.247
and then bought the building
behind his back.


1610
01:17:18.380 --> 01:17:20.513
Aidan couldn't work
for a guy like that.


1611
01:17:21.714 --> 01:17:23.380
So, he just quit?

1612
01:17:24.647 --> 01:17:26.647
He was never long
for real estate.


1613
01:17:26.780 --> 01:17:28.580
It was only a
matter of time.


1614
01:17:30.647 --> 01:17:32.380
He's devastated, Jessie.

1615
01:17:34.247 --> 01:17:35.547
He feels awful.

1616
01:17:36.547 --> 01:17:38.580
I haven't seen him
this unhappy since...


1617
01:17:43.780 --> 01:17:48.213
Let's just say that the time
he spent with you,


1618
01:17:48.347 --> 01:17:51.513
that's the happiest I've
seen him in a really long time.


1619
01:17:53.247 --> 01:17:54.180
Riley too.

1620
01:18:00.714 --> 01:18:02.146
I should finish your cake.

1621
01:18:03.380 --> 01:18:04.413
The wedding's tomorrow.

1622
01:18:05.647 --> 01:18:07.113
I really hope you come.

1623
01:18:10.480 --> 01:18:13.480
There's one more addition
that I need to make.


1624
01:18:16.647 --> 01:18:18.513
Another cake?

1625
01:18:18.647 --> 01:18:20.247
Who needs two wedding cakes?

1626
01:18:20.380 --> 01:18:22.714
It's just a small one
and she's paying double for it.


1627
01:18:22.847 --> 01:18:26.080
And that's going straight
into your pocket, I swear.


1628
01:18:26.213 --> 01:18:27.413
Really?

1629
01:18:27.547 --> 01:18:30.213
In that case, let's bake!

1630
01:18:31.413 --> 01:18:33.513
I don't know what I would do
without you, Beatrice.


1631
01:18:33.647 --> 01:18:34.814
Right back atcha.

1632
01:18:35.847 --> 01:18:38.580
You did a stunning job.
Really.


1633
01:18:38.714 --> 01:18:41.080
Better than I could have done.

1634
01:18:41.213 --> 01:18:41.913
Thanks.

1635
01:18:44.247 --> 01:18:47.146
Guys, I think I
found us a winner.


1636
01:18:57.180 --> 01:19:00.614
It's beautiful. I love it!

1637
01:19:00.747 --> 01:19:02.213
It looks... cool!

1638
01:19:02.913 --> 01:19:05.313
Are we going to be cool
in our next iteration?


1639
01:19:05.447 --> 01:19:07.180
I see nothing wrong with that.

1640
01:19:07.313 --> 01:19:08.380
And the kitchen looks huge.

1641
01:19:08.513 --> 01:19:10.347
We wouldn't even have to keep
renting a second one.


1642
01:19:10.480 --> 01:19:12.447
And it's affordable.

1643
01:19:12.580 --> 01:19:14.780
The neighborhood is
just about to pop.


1644
01:19:14.913 --> 01:19:17.347
It's not just a good idea
for the bakery,


1645
01:19:17.480 --> 01:19:20.146
it's a good real estate
investment.


1646
01:19:20.280 --> 01:19:21.280
Let's do it.

1647
01:19:23.213 --> 01:19:24.113
-Really?
-Yeah.


1648
01:19:24.247 --> 01:19:25.447
-Let's go for it.
-Yeah!


1649
01:19:27.380 --> 01:19:29.647
And I wanted to talk to
you guys about something.


1650
01:19:29.780 --> 01:19:33.680
You guys carried me through
the worst week of my life.


1651
01:19:33.814 --> 01:19:36.447
You guys have been with me,
if not in front of me,


1652
01:19:36.580 --> 01:19:39.280
through good times and bad.

1653
01:19:39.413 --> 01:19:41.280
This whole thing has shown me
that it's not about


1654
01:19:41.413 --> 01:19:44.480
where you bake, it's
about who you bake with.


1655
01:19:45.580 --> 01:19:47.647
I want you to be part owners.

1656
01:19:49.247 --> 01:19:51.213
Are you... serious?

1657
01:19:51.913 --> 01:19:54.113
I want you to have
stake in this place.


1658
01:19:54.247 --> 01:19:55.180
Hopefully it will make up

1659
01:19:55.313 --> 01:19:56.614
for everything I've
put you through.


1660
01:19:56.747 --> 01:19:58.780
I'll still be the majority
owner, but...


1661
01:19:58.913 --> 01:20:01.680
What do you guys say?
Partners?


1662
01:20:02.747 --> 01:20:04.380
Accept! I do!

1663
01:20:06.614 --> 01:20:07.580
Thank you.

1664
01:20:10.380 --> 01:20:11.714
I take it that's a yes?

1665
01:20:13.780 --> 01:20:14.647
Yes.

1666
01:20:19.547 --> 01:20:22.180
Think you guys can handle
the cake for an hour?


1667
01:20:22.313 --> 01:20:24.146
There's something I gotta do.

1668
01:20:24.280 --> 01:20:25.313
Of course.

1669
01:20:25.447 --> 01:20:26.180
Where are you going?

1670
01:20:26.313 --> 01:20:28.480
My apology tour
isn't quite over.


1671
01:20:28.614 --> 01:20:29.847
Go get him.

1672
01:20:35.480 --> 01:20:36.413
Partners?

1673
01:20:54.280 --> 01:20:55.247
Jessie.

1674
01:20:55.380 --> 01:20:56.280
Hey.

1675
01:20:57.213 --> 01:20:58.513
-Look, I...
-It's okay.


1676
01:20:58.647 --> 01:21:01.747
Suzanne told me what really
happened with your boss.


1677
01:21:01.880 --> 01:21:02.780
I'm sorry.

1678
01:21:02.913 --> 01:21:04.213
I'm sorry, too.

1679
01:21:05.380 --> 01:21:07.146
Did you mean what you said?

1680
01:21:07.280 --> 01:21:09.913
That you don't want
to see me anymore?


1681
01:21:11.013 --> 01:21:13.347
No, of course not.

1682
01:21:16.614 --> 01:21:17.880
What are you working on?

1683
01:21:18.847 --> 01:21:21.547
Well, it's for you, actually.

1684
01:21:23.814 --> 01:21:26.313
Oh, you made this for me?

1685
01:21:26.447 --> 01:21:29.647
Yeah... look, I'm sorry
you lost your building.


1686
01:21:29.780 --> 01:21:34.513
But your new one is going
to be just as great.


1687
01:21:34.647 --> 01:21:36.447
Better even.

1688
01:21:36.580 --> 01:21:37.814
Baked With Love?

1689
01:21:37.946 --> 01:21:39.647
I was just playing around.

1690
01:21:39.780 --> 01:21:41.714
If you want to change it,
I don't...


1691
01:21:41.847 --> 01:21:42.814
I love it.

1692
01:21:58.814 --> 01:22:01.247
Does this mean you're
still coming with me


1693
01:22:01.380 --> 01:22:02.780
to Suzanne's wedding?

1694
01:22:02.913 --> 01:22:05.013
I wouldn't miss it
for the world.


1695
01:24:26.146 --> 01:24:27.880
Suzanne, do you take Evan Miller

1696
01:24:28.013 --> 01:24:29.913
to be your lawfully
wedded husband,


1697
01:24:30.046 --> 01:24:31.480
in sickness and in health,

1698
01:24:31.614 --> 01:24:33.814
for as long as you
both shall live?


1699
01:24:33.946 --> 01:24:34.946
I do.

1700
01:24:36.247 --> 01:24:39.647
Evan, do you take Suzanne Cooper
to be your lawfully wedded wife,


1701
01:24:39.780 --> 01:24:41.547
in sickness and in health,

1702
01:24:41.680 --> 01:24:43.046
for as long as you
both shall live?


1703
01:24:43.180 --> 01:24:44.780
Baby, you bet I do.

1704
01:24:44.913 --> 01:24:46.580
I now pronounce
you man and wife.


1705
01:24:46.714 --> 01:24:48.913
You may kiss the bride.

1706
01:24:53.213 --> 01:24:55.847
(applauding)

1707
01:25:16.213 --> 01:25:17.980
You guys ready for some cake?

1708
01:25:19.946 --> 01:25:20.980
I almost forgot...

1709
01:25:26.847 --> 01:25:27.814
For you.

1710
01:25:28.880 --> 01:25:29.847
Chocolate?

1711
01:25:29.980 --> 01:25:30.913
I had to.

1712
01:25:31.046 --> 01:25:32.847
It's your favorite.

1713
01:25:32.980 --> 01:25:34.880
Do you want to take
the first bite?


1714
01:25:37.680 --> 01:25:38.946
You want daddy to help you?

1715
01:25:42.046 --> 01:25:43.180
That's a big bite...

1716
01:25:43.313 --> 01:25:45.113
Little smaller, there we go,
coming in...


1717
01:25:51.180 --> 01:25:51.880
Jessie...

1718
01:25:52.013 --> 01:25:54.614
The cake is
absolutely incredible.


1719
01:25:55.046 --> 01:25:55.980
Thank you.

1720
01:26:12.213 --> 01:26:13.714
Whoa, this is so good.

1721
01:26:13.847 --> 01:26:14.814
Seriously!

1722
01:26:14.946 --> 01:26:16.647
Your best work yet, by far.

1723
01:26:16.780 --> 01:26:18.680
It was a collaborative effort.

1724
01:26:20.780 --> 01:26:23.080
Excuse me, I have to ask.

1725
01:26:23.213 --> 01:26:25.146
Did you make that stunning
wedding arch?


1726
01:26:26.213 --> 01:26:28.647
I... yeah, I did.

1727
01:26:29.714 --> 01:26:30.847
I'm a carpenter.

1728
01:26:46.847 --> 01:26:48.247
Looks like you've got
your work cut out for you


1729
01:26:48.380 --> 01:26:49.413
for the next few months.

1730
01:26:49.547 --> 01:26:52.847
Aidan Cooper is the new
hot furniture guy in town.


1731
01:26:52.980 --> 01:26:54.814
I guess we'll both be
pretty busy then, huh?


1732
01:26:54.946 --> 01:26:56.946
What with the bakery and all.

1733
01:26:57.080 --> 01:26:59.747
There's a building for sale
next to my new space.


1734
01:26:59.946 --> 01:27:01.946
Perfect spot for
a furniture store.


1735
01:27:02.080 --> 01:27:02.980
Just saying...

1736
01:27:03.113 --> 01:27:04.847
Working next
to my girlfriend?


1737
01:27:05.780 --> 01:27:06.913
I like the sound of that.

1738
01:27:07.046 --> 01:27:08.580
Girlfriend, huh?

1739
01:27:08.714 --> 01:27:09.580
Yup.

1740
01:27:13.013 --> 01:27:15.714
I love you, Jessie Dale.

1741
01:27:15.847 --> 01:27:17.780
I love you too.

1742
