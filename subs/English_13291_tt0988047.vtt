We don't.
We have no authority here.

Answer the question.

85

Sorry. Must have forgotten
my Bill of Rights at home.

An opportunist perhaps,
but not a fanatic.


91

So consider this opportunity.

92

You go right ahead.

The only difference
between you and him

is he knows he's an asshole.

a suicide mission at the time,

but we always had
a plan to come home.

166
00:19:25.848 --> 00:19:28.316
You must be willing to sacrifice

You don't defeat an empire

Once upon a time,

it was the Americans
who were terrorists to the British.

Staff Sergeant Samir Horn.
U.S. Army Special Forces.

The Army sent Horn to Pakistan

He planned on waking up

With all due respect, 
Brother Fareed,

332
00:31:21.296 --> 00:31:24.788
<i>the Hadith says that the prophet
Muhammad Sall-Allahu Alayhi Wa Sallam</i>


333
00:31:24.866 --> 00:31:28.233
told his followers that they could
lie about being Muslims


334
00:31:28.303 --> 00:31:31.295
to save their lives
if death was imminent.


335
00:31:31.373 --> 00:31:36.572
- lt didn't mention--
- ls death not imminent now?


336
00:31:36.645 --> 00:31:38.044
We're at war today.

337
00:31:38.113 --> 00:31:40.911
And to be effective,
you need to blend in.


338
00:31:42.350 --> 00:31:44.682
No one's even looking at us.

339
00:31:46.755 --> 00:31:49.747
l told you, he's not some foot soldier.

340
00:31:49.824 --> 00:31:51.519
Samir is a man of faith.

341
00:31:51.593 --> 00:31:54.289
Faith is good.

342
00:31:54.362 --> 00:31:59.197
But you have to know
how to follow orders, too.

00:34:21.109 --> 00:34:23.373
He's involved

Uh, we don't use the term

Yes, l do believe in God.
Why do you ask?

Because you will never understand

Would you describe him

A week ago.


409

- Yeah, of course it is.

lf you want to help Samir,
you should talk to me.

Do you think that every
Muslim man is a terrorist?


420
00:36:20.595 --> 00:36:22.153
On the contrary.

421
00:36:22.230 --> 00:36:23.788
l am, however,
looking for those who are.


422
00:36:23.865 --> 00:36:25.833
Now if you have any knowledge
of what he's been involved in,


423
00:36:25.900 --> 00:36:27.629
you do have an obligation
to share that with me.


424
00:36:27.702 --> 00:36:29.533
Are you charging me with anything?

425
00:36:29.604 --> 00:36:30.662
No, l'm not.

426
00:36:30.738 --> 00:36:32.638
When you have something more
than secret evidence,


427
00:36:32.707 --> 00:36:33.901
then l'll talk to you.

428
00:36:37.078 --> 00:36:40.013
Uh, they just fired him.
No explanation.


429
00:36:40.081 --> 00:36:42.743
But, uh, it was pretty obvious why.

430
00:36:42.817 --> 00:36:44.717
How did Samir take it?

431
00:36:44.786 --> 00:36:46.310
How do you think?

432
00:36:46.387 --> 00:36:47.945
So why did you let Mr. Horn go?

433
00:36:48.022 --> 00:36:50.217
Jeez, that was over a year ago.

434
00:36:50.291 --> 00:36:51.952
l don't recall the details.

435
00:36:52.026 --> 00:36:55.928
The information that we gather
for these types of background checks


436
00:36:55.997 --> 00:36:56.986
is strictly confidential.

437
00:36:57.065 --> 00:36:59.363
Look, as far as l'm concerned,

438
00:36:59.434 --> 00:37:01.334
a man's religion is his own business.

439
00:37:01.402 --> 00:37:05.099
But when you wear a skullcap

00:37:07.208 --> 00:37:08.835
Some of our clients complained.

442
00:37:30.899 --> 00:37:32.696
Horn gets to Chicago when he's 12.

443
00:37:32.767 --> 00:37:35.133
He's just watched his father die.
He's arrived from Sudan.


444
00:37:35.203 --> 00:37:37.865
He's going through culture shock.
lt's a classic profile.


445
00:37:37.939 --> 00:37:39.998
He's caught between
traditional lslam and the West.


446
00:37:40.074 --> 00:37:41.541
His test scores are off the charts.

447
00:37:41.609 --> 00:37:43.600
But it said he had
some behavioral problems.


448
00:37:43.678 --> 00:37:46.613
He was kicked out of high school
his senior year for getting into a fight.


449
00:37:46.681 --> 00:37:47.670
About what?

450
00:37:47.749 --> 00:37:49.512
Three white students
were harassing a black girl.


451
00:37:49.584 --> 00:37:50.744
Horn intervened.

452
00:37:50.818 --> 00:37:53.548
Two of the boys
had to be hospitalized.


453
00:37:53.621 --> 00:37:55.748
Now he enlisted in the military
right after that.


454
00:37:55.823 --> 00:37:57.950
His Army file was classified.

455
00:37:58.026 --> 00:37:59.960
But here's a copy.

456
00:38:00.028 --> 00:38:02.656
After he leaves the Army,
Horn fights in Afghanistan


457
00:38:02.730 --> 00:38:04.061
for a few years.

458
00:38:04.132 --> 00:38:07.829
The list of people he could have met there
is practically a who's who of lslamic terrorists,


459
00:38:07.902 --> 00:38:09.836
from Abdul Azim
to Osama bin Laden.


460
00:38:09.904 --> 00:38:12.372
Now we pretty much lose track of him
until he shows up in Bosnia


461
00:38:12.440 --> 00:38:14.738
where he meets Chandra Dawkin,
the photojournalist.


462
00:38:14.809 --> 00:38:16.640
- ls she a spy?
- No.


463
00:38:16.711 --> 00:38:18.110
The FBl tried to question her,

464
00:38:18.179 --> 00:38:20.647
but my source says
she was uncooperative.


465
00:38:20.715 --> 00:38:22.444
Last fall is when things
seemed to change.


466
00:38:22.517 --> 00:38:25.486
He loses his job, spends more
and more time at the mosque.


467
00:38:25.553 --> 00:38:28.954
Then he begins disappearing
on these long trips overseas.


468

00:53:33.260 --> 00:53:34.955
Back it up right there.

629
00:54:13.467 --> 00:54:15.025
What happened?

630
00:54:15.102 --> 00:54:16.899
There were no Americans inside.

631
00:54:16.970 --> 00:54:19.063
The two dead embassy
employees were fakes,


632
00:54:19.139 --> 00:54:20.970
bodies from the morgue
with false identities


633
00:54:21.041 --> 00:54:22.030
just like we talked about.

634
00:54:22.109 --> 00:54:23.576
Why is the news saying eight people?

635
00:54:23.644 --> 00:54:26.408
There was some unscheduled maintenance
in a part of the consulate


636
00:54:26.480 --> 00:54:29.449
that was supposed to be empty,
all right?


637
00:54:29.516 --> 00:54:31.507
l didn't know they'd be there.

638
00:54:31.585 --> 00:54:33.985
Listen, we couldn't control everything.

639
00:54:34.054 --> 00:54:37.046
Nobody was supposed to die!
l'm sorry, Samir.


640
00:54:48.201 --> 00:54:50.362
Look, what do you want me to say?

641
00:54:50.437 --> 00:54:51.563
We set off a bomb.

642
00:54:51.638 --> 00:54:54.004
No, l set off a bomb.

643
00:55:06.853 --> 00:55:09.822
Look, l know you paid
a price to get this far.


644
00:55:09.890 --> 00:55:11.858
Okay? You're close.

645
00:55:11.925 --> 00:55:14.985
You're very close.

646
00:55:18.398 --> 00:55:20.923
l don't know, man.
You tell me.


647
00:55:22.502 --> 00:55:24.197
Do we stop?

<b>(speaking Arabic)</b>

650
00:56:43.917 --> 00:56:46.852
What made you learn Arabic?

651
00:56:46.920 --> 00:56:49.684
l took a class in college
and got hooked.


652
00:56:49.756 --> 00:56:52.987
l even switched my major
from Religion to Arabic Studies.


653
00:56:53.060 --> 00:56:55.688
You were a Religion major?

654
00:56:55.762 --> 00:56:57.457
My daddy was a Baptist minister.

655
00:56:57.531 --> 00:57:00.125
His daddy was a Baptist minister.

656
00:57:00.200 --> 00:57:02.532
lt's in the blood.

657
00:57:02.602 --> 00:57:04.695
You know, when J. Edgar
were in office,


658
00:57:04.771 --> 00:57:07.433
he never would have
let you into the FBl.


659
00:57:07.507 --> 00:57:09.202
Wasn't my original plan.

660
00:57:09.276 --> 00:57:13.178
Not a lot of jobs, however,
for Ph.D.s in Arabic Studies.


661
00:57:13.246 --> 00:57:14.577
Oh, l get it now.

662
00:57:14.648 --> 00:57:17.742
You were an egghead
who got dragged into a street fight.


663
00:57:19.052 --> 00:57:21.612
Nobody gets dragged into a street fight.

Welcome to Toronto, 
Brother Samir.

667
00:57:51.451 --> 00:57:53.476
lt's a great honor, Emir.

668
00:57:53.553 --> 00:57:54.918
Please, sit.

669
00:57:54.988 --> 00:57:56.250
Thank you.

670
00:57:59.760 --> 00:58:02.092
- Tea?
- Yes, thank you.


671
00:58:05.665 --> 00:58:09.328
Omar tells me that you play chess.

672
00:58:09.402 --> 00:58:11.165
Only a little. Thank you.

673
00:58:11.238 --> 00:58:13.934
ln chess and in war,
the key to winning


674
00:58:14.007 --> 00:58:17.170
is to anticipate what your opponent
will do in advance.


675
00:58:17.244 --> 00:58:19.576
Think two moves ahead.

676
00:58:19.646 --> 00:58:21.944
The art of asymmetrical warfare

677
00:58:22.015 --> 00:58:26.918
is less about inflicting damage
than provoking a response.


678
00:58:26.987 --> 00:58:29.285
Terrorism is theater.

679
00:58:29.356 --> 00:58:33.190
And theater is always performed
for an audience.


680
00:58:33.260 --> 00:58:36.024
Ours is the American people.

681
00:58:36.096 --> 00:58:42.057
But we are dispersed
across a large country.


682
00:58:42.135 --> 00:58:44.069
The question is,

683
00:58:44.137 --> 00:58:47.868
how to convince them
that nowhere is safe.


684
00:58:49.776 --> 00:58:51.676
Samir, imagine a bus
traveling cross-country


685
00:58:51.745 --> 00:58:53.474
filled with average, everyday Americans.

686
00:58:53.547 --> 00:58:54.980
People from-- from all over.

687
00:58:55.048 --> 00:58:57.710
From small towns,
from the country.


688
00:58:57.784 --> 00:58:59.809
lmagine the effect it would have

689
00:58:59.886 --> 00:59:04.653
if that very same bus
were to suddenly explode.


690
00:59:04.724 --> 00:59:07.215
Now multiply that by 50.

691
00:59:07.294 --> 00:59:11.526
Fifty buses across
the heartland of America,


692
00:59:11.598 --> 00:59:13.327
all at the same time,

693
00:59:13.400 --> 00:59:15.891
on the same day.

694
00:59:15.969 --> 00:59:20.599
<i>We call this operation
Risala Shukra Al-hiba.</i>


695
00:59:20.674 --> 00:59:23.165
For years we've been planting
martyrs in their midst.


696
00:59:24.678 --> 00:59:26.703
They are waiting for a signal,

697
00:59:26.780 --> 00:59:29.806
instructions, material.

698
00:59:31.151 --> 00:59:35.554
We need somebody who can move
about the country without drawing attention.


699
00:59:35.622 --> 00:59:38.853
Somebody who blends in.

700
00:59:41.728 --> 00:59:44.288
An American messenger, Samir.

701
00:59:58.345 --> 01:00:01.007
He isn't capable of this.

702
01:00:01.081 --> 01:00:03.675
l don't like having to show
these to you, Chandra.


703
01:00:03.750 --> 01:00:06.719
But we need to find him
before this happens again.


704
01:00:06.786 --> 01:00:11.951
Samir always said that these people
were lslam's worse enemies.


705
01:00:12.025 --> 01:00:14.585
Oh, he fought a Holy War
with these folks in Afghanistan


706
01:00:14.661 --> 01:00:16.526
and then again in Bosnia.

707
01:00:16.596 --> 01:00:18.530
He was trained to kill.

708
01:00:18.598 --> 01:00:21.192
He was a soldier, not a murderer.

709
01:00:22.802 --> 01:00:26.101
l believe he deceived you
as much as anybody else.


710
01:00:29.910 --> 01:00:34.540
His faith was a source of strength.

711
01:00:35.949 --> 01:00:37.314
Not this.

712
01:00:56.169 --> 01:00:58.296
- Welcome to the U.S.
- Thanks.


713
01:01:29.069 --> 01:01:31.003

lncluding the FBl?

01:03:07.400 --> 01:03:10.597
Yeah. Especially the FBl.

730

Probably not until l do
what it is they sent me to do.

Then you keep on going.

Well, the problem is,
to keep going means


735
01:03:22.615 --> 01:03:25.083
l'm going to have to put real bombs
in their hands now soon.

We gotta talk about
how we're gonna send these e-mails.


762
01:05:21.201 --> 01:05:23.431
What do you mean?
l thought we decided to use coded e-mail.


763
01:05:23.503 --> 01:05:24.629
No, no, we did. We did.

764

But the problem is e-mails
can get intercepted.

l got a better idea.

766
01:05:29.075 --> 01:05:32.806
We're gonna give each of our people
an e-mail account and a password. All right?


767
01:05:32.879 --> 01:05:35.370
Then when we're ready to go,
we log onto each one,


768
01:05:35.448 --> 01:05:38.042
we write the instructions,
but we don't send them.

Perhaps you haven't had time
to read the fine print of the Patriot Act,

Now each transfer
in excess of $10,000


804
01:10:37.283 --> 01:10:38.750
can be treated as a separate felony

805
01:10:38.818 --> 01:10:41.514
and each count is punishable
by up to five years in prison.

Yes. But going to see the woman

959
01:25:43.021 --> 01:25:45.512
One of them has a record

960
01:25:45.590 --> 01:25:47.649
<i>Risala Shukra Al-hiba.</i>

961

Our phone intercept.

963
01:25:50.562 --> 01:25:52.928
Your intercept only picked up
the first part of the code name.


964
01:25:52.998 --> 01:25:55.762
The date of the attack
is in the full name. Leyla?


965
01:25:55.834 --> 01:25:57.165
<i>''Risala'' means ''message,''</i>

966
01:25:57.235 --> 01:26:00.068
<i>''Shukra'' means ''thanks''
and ''Al-hiba'' is ''the gift.''</i>


967
01:26:00.138 --> 01:26:03.403
So the literal translation is
''Message of thanks for the gift.''


968
01:26:03.475 --> 01:26:05.340
Thanksgiving.

969

What about the target?

972
01:26:10.849 --> 01:26:13.079
Well, we found traces
of Semtex in the vehicle


973
01:26:13.151 --> 01:26:14.641
Horn abandoned in Chicago.

974

in California a month ago.


975

right across the entire country by now.


976

We'll raise the threat level.

977
01:26:25.464 --> 01:26:28.456
Double up protection on bridges,
airports, monuments, the White House.


978
01:26:28.533 --> 01:26:32.333
Sir, l would also suggest that we place Horn
on the high-value target list, too.

- You are a traitor!


1097
01:41:17.455 --> 01:41:19.719
No! Nathir was the traitor.

1098
01:41:19.790 --> 01:41:22.156
Fareed was the traitor.
They betrayed lslam!


1099
01:41:22.226 --> 01:41:23.659
No! l don't want to listen to you!

1100
01:41:23.728 --> 01:41:26.663
- l'm gonna kill you, Samir!
- lt doesn't matter.


1101
01:41:26.731 --> 01:41:29.097
l was dead as soon
as l stepped foot on this ship.


1102
01:41:29.166 --> 01:41:31.225
But l had to stop them.
l had to stop this--


1103
01:41:31.302 --> 01:41:34.829
What the hell are you talking about?
You haven't stopped shit!


1104
01:41:34.905 --> 01:41:37.772
Thirty buses are going to explode!

1105
01:41:45.449 --> 01:41:48.441
<b>(breathing erratically)</b>

<b>(tires screeching)</b>

1113
01:42:22.453 --> 01:42:24.717
l put them all on the same bus.

No. No, that can't be.

1115
01:42:31.195 --> 01:42:33.425
l saw you give them the bombs.

1116
01:42:33.497 --> 01:42:35.021
l saw the e-mails.

1117

Omar.

Omar.

1124

l am your brother.

1125
01:43:31.789 --> 01:43:34.519
They used you, Omar.

1126
01:43:34.592 --> 01:43:37.152
They used me, too.
All of them.


1127
01:43:37.228 --> 01:43:39.059
They used us for our faith.

1128
01:43:44.435 --> 01:43:46.801
<b>(metallic clang)</b>

1129

Omar. Omar!

1131
01:43:54.645 --> 01:43:56.977
Hold your fire. 
Hold your fire!

- Samir?
- <b>(groaning)</b>


1133
01:44:08.158 --> 01:44:09.455
Samir, where's Nathir?

1134
01:44:26.443 --> 01:44:28.536
Hang in there, Samir.

1135
01:44:28.612 --> 01:44:30.637
Call a paramedic.

1136
01:44:33.150 --> 01:44:35.015
lt'll be okay.

1137
01:45:08.285 --> 01:45:09.809
Samir.

1138
01:45:13.057 --> 01:45:15.491
You wanna take a ride and talk?

1139
01:45:18.295 --> 01:45:20.627
We can talk right here.

1140
01:45:29.239 --> 01:45:32.106
Good to see you up and about.

1141
01:45:32.176 --> 01:45:34.371
Didn't know if you'd make it.

1142
01:45:34.445 --> 01:45:36.140
How's the shoulder?

1143
01:45:36.213 --> 01:45:38.773
l'll live.

1144
01:45:38.849 --> 01:45:41.317
l don't suspect
anybody's said this to you,


1145
01:45:41.385 --> 01:45:45.845
but this country owes you
a huge debt.


1146
01:45:45.923 --> 01:45:50.121
You came all the way out here
just to tell me that?


1147
01:45:50.194 --> 01:45:51.786
Come on, Clayton.
l'm going someplace.


1148
01:45:51.862 --> 01:45:53.193
What do you want?

1149
01:45:55.566 --> 01:45:57.796
l've had your file wiped clean.

1150
01:45:57.868 --> 01:45:59.130
Everything.

1151
01:45:59.203 --> 01:46:01.728
The bombing at France,
the bus, all of it.


1152
01:46:01.805 --> 01:46:06.299
Effectively, you're a free man
but there's still a lot that you can do for us.


1153
01:46:06.377 --> 01:46:09.005
l'm a free man?

1154
01:46:09.079 --> 01:46:11.673
This doesn't feel like freedom
to me, Clayton.


1155
01:46:11.749 --> 01:46:13.808
You think because you hit ''delete''
on some computer somewhere


1156
01:46:13.884 --> 01:46:15.442
that that's it, it's over?

1157
01:46:15.519 --> 01:46:17.350
l made choices about people's lives.

1158
01:46:17.421 --> 01:46:18.854
- And l gotta live with that.
- l understand.


1159
01:46:18.922 --> 01:46:20.719
- Forever, Clayton.
- l understand that.


1160
01:46:20.791 --> 01:46:24.192
But you and l both know
that this fight is far from over.


1161
01:46:28.732 --> 01:46:31.530
You know, the Qur'an says
that if you kill an innocent person,


1162
01:46:31.602 --> 01:46:34.366
it's as if you've killed all mankind?

1163
01:46:36.507 --> 01:46:38.407
<b>(sighs)</b>

1164
01:46:38.475 --> 01:46:43.936
lt also says that if you save a life,
it's like you've saved all mankind.


1165
01:46:44.014 --> 01:46:46.346
You're a hero, Samir.

1166
01:46:50.254 --> 01:46:53.917
Look, whatever you want to call me,

1167
01:46:53.991 --> 01:46:55.652
l'm done.

1168
01:46:58.862 --> 01:47:01.228
Well, we know how to find each other.

1169
01:47:04.802 --> 01:47:06.235
<i>As
-Salamu Alaykum.</i>

1170
01:47:09.740 --> 01:47:11.401
<i>Wa alaikum assalam.</i>

1171
01:47:15.846 --> 01:47:18.815
And you should start
the conversation with that.


1172
01:49:40.891 --> 01:49:43.883
