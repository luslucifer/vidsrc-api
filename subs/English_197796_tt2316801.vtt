1
00:01:07.257 --> 00:01:10.835
Beauty and the Beast

2
00:01:11.637 --> 00:01:13.133
<i>Once upon a time,</i>

3
00:01:13.133 --> 00:01:14.280
<i>There was a rich merchant.</i>

4
00:01:14.456 --> 00:01:21.522
<i>Good and brave, after his wife's death,
he lived for the happiness of his six children.</i>


5
00:01:21.728 --> 00:01:27.235
<i>Three girls and three boys filled the house
with joy after their mother's passing.</i>


6
00:01:29.685 --> 00:01:32.631
- <i>A little guest!</i>
- <i>And she wants to hear the story.</i>


7
00:01:35.252 --> 00:01:39.948
<i>Let's make a wish.
But quietly, or it won't come true.</i>


8
00:01:43.522 --> 00:01:45.824
- Did you make your wish?
- <i>Yes!</i>


9
00:01:46.468 --> 00:01:50.745
Now then, one... two... three!

10
00:02:00.268 --> 00:02:01.268
<i>Now,</i>

11
00:02:01.768 --> 00:02:03.215
<i>Want to hear the rest of the story?</i>

12
00:02:03.307 --> 00:02:04.317
- Yes!
- Yup!


13
00:02:07.444 --> 00:02:12.007
<i>The Merchant had three ships,
who were his pride and wealth.</i>


14
00:02:12.155 --> 00:02:18.042
<i>They were called</i>The Siren<i>,</i>The Triton<i>.
And, the largest,</i> The Livia.


15
00:02:22.859 --> 00:02:24.851
<i>Loaded with his goods,</i>

16
00:02:25.084 --> 00:02:28.866
<i>when suddenly
a terrible storm struck.</i>


17
00:02:34.338 --> 00:02:36.698
<i>The captain was lost amidst the waters.</i>

18
00:02:37.373 --> 00:02:40.243
<i>Lightning slashed the masts.</i>

19
00:02:41.143 --> 00:02:44.343
<i>In the deep sea, where the
cold and silence reign,</i>


20
00:02:44.508 --> 00:02:47.094
<i>suddenly glowed with
thousands of coins.</i>


21
00:02:47.874 --> 00:02:50.823
<i>His wealth scattered
among depths.</i>


22
00:02:50.923 --> 00:02:53.135
<i>Sunken, lost forever.</i>

23
00:03:08.102 --> 00:03:12.683
<i>After a month the merchant and his children
had to leave their house.</i>


24
00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:17.898
<i>Their friends, their routines.
All that that they once had...</i>


25
00:03:18.245 --> 00:03:19.569
<i>They lost their happiness.</i>

26
00:03:35.986 --> 00:03:37.830
Don't touch that!

27
00:03:44.118 --> 00:03:48.361
Very well, take it.
We'll only take what is most precious to us.


28
00:03:52.835 --> 00:03:56.632
- Leave at once, <i>monsieur</i>!
- Papa, do something!


29
00:04:00.036 --> 00:04:04.459
- No! Our jewelry, our beds, everything!
- Is it the end, I will die!


30
00:04:04.613 --> 00:04:09.662
Don't call me Papa with these people!
And you,  Anne, stop talking about dying!


31
00:04:10.861 --> 00:04:16.731
My heart! Poor you! Are you satisfied?
Goodbye!


32
00:04:17.776 --> 00:04:20.686
Papa, this is a catastrophe!
Where are we to live?


33
00:04:22.048 --> 00:04:25.985
- Where is Belle?
- "Belle", "Belle"! Always!


34
00:04:35.233 --> 00:04:36.899
Take this.

35
00:04:39.796 --> 00:04:41.648
Maxime, help me!

36
00:04:43.137 --> 00:04:45.636
- What's inside?
- All my books.


37
00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:50.872
Notebooks, notes...
I don't want leave them here.


38
00:04:51.037 --> 00:04:52.550
Tristan!

39
00:04:53.576 --> 00:04:55.915
- What is it?
- Keep an eye on your father.


40
00:04:56.111 --> 00:05:00.174
Don't let Maxim to spend
whatever's left.


41
00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:03.007
Calm down.
Everything will be fine.


42
00:05:04.207 --> 00:05:06.007
Watch it!

43
00:05:15.095 --> 00:05:19.097
- These fools, why don't they leave?
- Don't listen to them.


44
00:05:19.408 --> 00:05:23.781
Now what? Going to the village?

45
00:05:24.992 --> 00:05:28.866
It's better to take some time to forget?
Don't you think?


46
00:05:29.763 --> 00:05:32.195
Belle!

47
00:05:36.695 --> 00:05:38.695
Belle!

48
00:05:51.547 --> 00:05:53.105
Here, Mama.

49
00:05:53.281 --> 00:05:57.271
A fresh start,
I think I'm ready.


50
00:06:05.563 --> 00:06:07.966
Why must we leave the village?

51
00:06:09.362 --> 00:06:12.981
- We must.
- And you will like it.


52
00:06:13.386 --> 00:06:15.749
- I'm sure.
- I know.


53
00:06:15.997 --> 00:06:18.884
Have the pride and strength of this family.

54
00:06:21.251 --> 00:06:24.072
Go and hearken, as always.

55
00:06:51.785 --> 00:06:55.066
<i>They needed time
to adjust to her new life.</i>


56
00:06:55.165 --> 00:06:59.971
<i>First night, Belle remained awake
to hear the sound of the village.</i>


57
00:07:00.861 --> 00:07:02.976
<i>With the help of her brothers,</i>

58
00:07:03.405 --> 00:07:07.397
<i>She made a garden and
there she found solace.</i>


59
00:07:08.426 --> 00:07:10.228
Such heat.

60
00:07:11.385 --> 00:07:13.240
A wrinkle!

61
00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:15.943
What is this beast?

62
00:07:25.640 --> 00:07:30.963
Almost a month living this hellhole.
We will die alone...Wrinkled.


63
00:07:31.254 --> 00:07:32.883
Looking like beasts.

64
00:07:37.049 --> 00:07:37.930
Oh, Belle.

65
00:07:38.431 --> 00:07:41.473
Her happiness disgusts me.
I'd love to drown her in the well.


66
00:07:41.578 --> 00:07:43.864
Or bury her alive in her beloved garden.

67
00:07:44.922 --> 00:07:46.807
<i>What are you doing?</i>

68
00:07:50.072 --> 00:07:53.368
- Clotilde is sick, we're going to eat breakfast in bed.
- Certainly not!


69
00:07:53.559 --> 00:07:56.505
After lunch we're all
going to clean the garden.

70
00:07:56.635 --> 00:07:59.797
- I'd rather die.
- Come on, everybody down!


71
00:08:09.301 --> 00:08:10.829
<i>Defeated...</i>

72
00:08:10.992 --> 00:08:12.548
<i>comma...</i>

73
00:08:14.633 --> 00:08:16.495
<i>He was shot three times.</i>

74
00:08:17.620 --> 00:08:21.891
<i>The young man left the battlefield and
disappeared into the deep forest.</i>


75
00:08:31.416 --> 00:08:34.206
The whole Admiralty was pleased.

76
00:08:34.352 --> 00:08:36.226
Dumonts was very glamorous.

77
00:08:36.626 --> 00:08:39.473
- I think that his granddaughter is going to marry the Count.
- What!?


78
00:08:40.439 --> 00:08:42.099
But the big news is...

79
00:08:42.503 --> 00:08:45.957
That <i>Siren</i>,
your mother's favorite ship,


80
00:08:46.927 --> 00:08:48.550
has been found.

81
00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:53.253
Journey is long, but will
soon be in the harbor.

82
00:08:53.394 --> 00:08:55.594
- The cargo?
- Safely.


83
00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:57.751
Children, we are saved!

84
00:08:58.467 --> 00:09:00.830
We'd better pack.
Better yet - no!


85
00:09:01.019 --> 00:09:03.860
- Better to burn them.
- My heart throbs!


86
00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:06.559
I'm alive, Papa. I survived.

87
00:09:06.874 --> 00:09:10.613
We must return immediately.
Now, we need new dresses.


88
00:09:10.822 --> 00:09:13.836
- Perfume and what else?
- We'll make a list.


89
00:09:14.352 --> 00:09:16.658
- The happiness of the city.
- From the city.


90
00:09:17.017 --> 00:09:18.597
You will come with me.

91
00:09:19.650 --> 00:09:22.054
It's time to introduce my successor.

92
00:09:22.913 --> 00:09:25.678
I will not disappoint you, Father.
Thank you.


93
00:09:25.785 --> 00:09:30.495
He overcame his friends.
The young man went back home.


94
00:09:30.597 --> 00:09:33.434
With three children
between their people.


95
00:09:33.727 --> 00:09:35.268
For the ending.

96
00:09:36.163 --> 00:09:40.975
- New novel, brother?
- Something better. It is going to be a masterpiece.


97
00:09:55.052 --> 00:09:56.939
What about you?

98
00:09:58.052 --> 00:09:59.852
Are you mad?

99
00:10:00.552 --> 00:10:04.218
Obviously, when a girl is sad,
you want her to be angry.


100
00:10:04.385 --> 00:10:06.950
And if she is cheerful,
they say she is stupid.


101
00:10:07.105 --> 00:10:10.566
How am I to know?
All are happy except you.


102
00:10:16.251 --> 00:10:19.981
I wanted to stay longer.
That's all.


103
00:10:22.048 --> 00:10:26.724
We came here to hide our shame.
Our life is not here.


104
00:10:27.531 --> 00:10:29.484
You know what awaits us.

105
00:10:29.631 --> 00:10:32.504
Maxime will meet with
those vagabonds he calls friends.

106
00:10:32.651 --> 00:10:36.173
Anne and Clotilde will run like
crazy looking for husbands.


107
00:10:36.491 --> 00:10:38.977
Once again, you will be
busy with your work.


108
00:10:39.479 --> 00:10:42.381
Belle, one day none of that will matter,

109
00:10:42.485 --> 00:10:44.890
You grow up, your life will go on.

110
00:10:45.198 --> 00:10:48.903
I love you, but I must tell you,
that someday you will become a woman.


111
00:10:50.461 --> 00:10:53.233
Something to help you remember.
In case.


112
00:10:59.045 --> 00:11:01.292
What do you want me to bring?

113
00:11:02.402 --> 00:11:06.873
Just a rose.
I do not have any here.


114
00:11:36.300 --> 00:11:37.922
<i>Loan sharks took everything.</i>

115
00:11:38.053 --> 00:11:41.471
<i>Now I am not allowed
to have my own ship.</i>


116
00:11:41.830 --> 00:11:43.658
You must understand.

117
00:11:43.766 --> 00:11:48.192
<i>The Siren</i>  and her cargo
does not belong to you anymore.


118
00:11:50.165 --> 00:11:52.007
You forget something.

119
00:11:52.192 --> 00:11:56.422
Were it not for me, this place
would merely be a fishermen village!


120
00:11:56.825 --> 00:11:59.962
You played around with that, poor friend.

121
00:12:00.424 --> 00:12:03.238
You signed all letters of credit.

122
00:12:03.625 --> 00:12:05.618
I already inquired.

123
00:12:07.800 --> 00:12:10.384
I would not disbelieve either, Dumont.

124
00:12:10.563 --> 00:12:13.328
Were it not for me, you wouldn't
be sitting at this desk!


125
00:12:13.428 --> 00:12:17.588
Was it not you who lost
influence and wealth?


126
00:12:17.688 --> 00:12:20.415
- I'll break your head!
- Stop it, now!


127
00:12:22.747 --> 00:12:26.850
You don't understand.
You do not have power anymore.


128
00:12:28.266 --> 00:12:31.121
You aren't even bourgeois.
You are no one now.


129
00:12:34.396 --> 00:12:36.249
I'm sorry, Father.

130
00:12:43.955 --> 00:12:45.531
Maxim!

131
00:13:02.784 --> 00:13:06.805
I see a man.
Not to be ignored.


132
00:13:07.748 --> 00:13:10.004
He brings great news.

133
00:13:12.416 --> 00:13:17.944
- News? Good or bad?
- I'll find out when I read the card.


134
00:13:20.292 --> 00:13:23.459
Do you want to please me, Astrid?

135
00:13:23.612 --> 00:13:26.352
Divine me something exciting.

136
00:13:26.550 --> 00:13:30.069
I look at cards, my love.
I can't lie.


137
00:13:30.656 --> 00:13:33.350
Did not I warn you about the scar?

138
00:13:47.481 --> 00:13:49.355
Land of gold.

139
00:13:49.714 --> 00:13:52.184
Moonlight.

140
00:13:52.879 --> 00:13:54.541
Destiny smiles on you.

141
00:13:55.363 --> 00:13:57.961
Golden moonlight.

142
00:13:58.521 --> 00:14:00.666
Come! Cheers!

143
00:14:02.593 --> 00:14:05.164
I'll be rich!

144
00:14:05.464 --> 00:14:08.236
Anxious night. 
Smells of gunpowder.

145
00:14:08.752 --> 00:14:11.541
- What'll it be?
- I'm looking for my son.


146
00:14:11.641 --> 00:14:14.880
- Some have told me that he came here often.
- Everyone comes here.


147
00:14:15.407 --> 00:14:18.520
Well, what's his name?

148
00:14:18.900 --> 00:14:21.135
Maxim de Bofremon.

149
00:14:25.489 --> 00:14:30.407
Don't talk anymore.
He isn't allowed in here.


150
00:14:30.670 --> 00:14:33.676
- I need to find my son!
- You're not the only one!


151
00:14:39.377 --> 00:14:41.372
Get out fast! Come on!

152
00:14:48.359 --> 00:14:50.009
Your perfume...

153
00:14:52.945 --> 00:14:55.289
and prediction...

154
00:14:57.211 --> 00:14:59.815
give you more power over me.

155
00:15:05.871 --> 00:15:08.198
Monsieur de Bofremon.

156
00:15:09.513 --> 00:15:12.001
I've been looking for Maxim
for several months.


157
00:15:12.402 --> 00:15:16.501
- And I came across his old father.
- I don't know you.


158
00:15:17.015 --> 00:15:21.980
- Who are you?
- Perducas. At your service.


159
00:15:28.563 --> 00:15:31.248
Your son owes me
a rather large sum,


160
00:15:31.359 --> 00:15:35.978
Now if you will settle the account,
then all will be forgotten.


161
00:15:36.078 --> 00:15:38.031
My son isn't a gambler!

162
00:15:38.593 --> 00:15:41.271
Give them drink,
to leave us alone.


163
00:15:41.622 --> 00:15:43.507
He thinks we're beggars!

164
00:15:46.278 --> 00:15:48.633
<i>Don't you dare, Perducas!</i>

165
00:15:49.008 --> 00:15:50.742
<i>You know me.</i>

166
00:15:52.354 --> 00:15:53.970
Leave the man alone.

167
00:16:02.169 --> 00:16:04.060
Alright.

168
00:16:11.466 --> 00:16:14.812
And you, get out quickly behind the bar.

169
00:16:16.056 --> 00:16:17.743
Come on.

170
00:16:18.918 --> 00:16:22.007
<i>You've got balls, but they
won't leave you alone.</i>


171
00:16:22.052 --> 00:16:22.828
Get out!

172
00:17:19.843 --> 00:17:21.503
<i>On the way home,</i>

173
00:17:21.683 --> 00:17:25.723
<i>The Merchant struggled with
the cold wind and pain.</i>

174
00:17:26.573 --> 00:17:28.846
<i>He left the city without Maxime.</i>

175
00:17:29.023 --> 00:17:32.921
<i>Imagining his son wandering
alone in the dark or worse,</i>


176
00:17:33.033 --> 00:17:35.704
<i>lying in the dust with his throat cut.</i>

177
00:17:36.363 --> 00:17:38.393
<i>He's clutching the reins of his horse,</i>

178
00:17:38.633 --> 00:17:42.693
<i>Hurry to go home,
hoping that his son was there.</i>


179
00:18:44.468 --> 00:18:47.095
I can't carry you.

180
00:18:52.495 --> 00:18:54.426
Forgive me.

181
00:19:32.288 --> 00:19:34.170
My house!

182
00:19:34.270 --> 00:19:36.070
I did it!

183
00:19:37.728 --> 00:19:40.589
But it can't be.

184
00:21:06.513 --> 00:21:08.093
Is anyone there?

185
00:21:21.883 --> 00:21:23.503
I've lost my way.

186
00:21:26.923 --> 00:21:28.563
The door was open.

187
00:22:05.663 --> 00:22:07.273
Who's there?

188
00:22:37.860 --> 00:22:40.173
I'm dreaming...

189
00:22:42.673 --> 00:22:45.119
...or I've died and am in heaven?

190
00:22:47.763 --> 00:22:49.613
No, obviously I live.

191
00:22:50.323 --> 00:22:52.243
And I'm hungry.

192
00:23:02.779 --> 00:23:06.103
I'd like to get something from the table.

193
00:24:24.033 --> 00:24:25.753
The dress.

194
00:24:28.713 --> 00:24:30.403
The shawl!

195
00:24:31.483 --> 00:24:33.093
Makeup powder.

196
00:24:33.523 --> 00:24:35.323
Incredible! Everything is here!

197
00:24:38.093 --> 00:24:40.023
Well, almost everything.

198
00:24:55.023 --> 00:24:56.676
Who cured you?

199
00:26:32.521 --> 00:26:37.350
I see that you were not satisfied with my gifts.
You wanted to steal that which is dearest to me.


200
00:26:40.923 --> 00:26:44.273
Do not call me a thief or coward!

201
00:26:45.953 --> 00:26:48.140
I'm a man of his word...of honor!

202
00:26:48.243 --> 00:26:50.293
For whom did you take this rose?

203
00:26:52.531 --> 00:26:54.617
For my youngest daughter!

204
00:26:56.087 --> 00:26:58.441
I love her more
than anything in the world!

205
00:26:58.603 --> 00:27:02.933
Then I'll give you a day
to say goodbye to their loved ones.


206
00:27:03.093 --> 00:27:07.013
And remember the words:
"More than anything in the world."


207
00:27:07.623 --> 00:27:11.356
I'll whisper your horse
and it will bring you here.


208
00:27:12.783 --> 00:27:16.493
- I'm never coming back!
- Yes, you will come back.


209
00:27:16.623 --> 00:27:21.536
Otherwise, I'll kill all your children.
One after another.


210
00:27:22.183 --> 00:27:26.248
And I'll her first,
for she is your favorite.


211
00:27:28.078 --> 00:27:29.785
Remember this.

212
00:27:30.503 --> 00:27:34.440
A life for a rose.

213
00:27:55.263 --> 00:27:57.956
Here! It's him!

214
00:27:58.284 --> 00:27:58.784
Father!

215
00:27:59.701 --> 00:28:00.334
Father!

216
00:28:00.972 --> 00:28:01.504
Father!

217
00:28:02.766 --> 00:28:03.350
Father!

218
00:28:14.353 --> 00:28:17.063
The story of a rose and a
strange beast seems like a fable.


219
00:28:17.163 --> 00:28:20.329
And where the gifts have come from?
I did not have money.


220
00:28:22.093 --> 00:28:24.250
<i>"More than anything in the world?"</i>

221
00:28:25.633 --> 00:28:29.904
- And the horse will magically find the way?
- This is all our fault.


222
00:28:30.173 --> 00:28:33.423
- But we did not ask for a rose.
- It is not anyone's fault.


223
00:28:33.523 --> 00:28:35.523
Silent.

224
00:28:36.473 --> 00:28:38.953
I can not say who this beast is,

225
00:28:39.243 --> 00:28:44.934
but because I stole this rose,
tomorrow I must return to him.


226
00:28:48.043 --> 00:28:51.858
- What will you do?
- I don't know Tristan.


227
00:28:52.333 --> 00:28:55.679
He said, "a life for a rose".

228
00:28:58.323 --> 00:29:03.431
- And if you don't go?
- Then we die.


229
00:29:03.531 --> 00:29:05.045
All of us.

230
00:29:28.620 --> 00:29:32.461
Don't say anything.
I know what you all think.


231
00:29:33.673 --> 00:29:38.855
- Mama died when I was born.
- I don't understand what that has to do with anything.


232
00:29:40.453 --> 00:29:42.993
I do not want
you to die because me!

233
00:29:51.273 --> 00:29:53.172
<i>Belle! Belle!</i>

234
00:29:53.873 --> 00:29:55.683
<i>Belle!</i>

235
00:29:56.423 --> 00:29:58.243
Don't forget me.

236
00:30:00.213 --> 00:30:01.768
<i>Belle!</i>

237
00:30:02.268 --> 00:30:04.268
<i>Belle! Belle!</i>

238
00:30:07.278 --> 00:30:09.948
- Belle!
- No, Father!


239
00:30:30.593 --> 00:30:33.813
Take me to the castle with this Beast.

240
00:30:34.983 --> 00:30:37.610
Soon as possible.

241
00:33:26.623 --> 00:33:29.653
<i>A Life for a rose.</i>

242
00:35:03.453 --> 00:35:08.035
<i>Belle was ready to die when
she heard the chimes of the clock.</i>


243
00:35:09.523 --> 00:35:11.713
<i>But she found in
the castle of the Beast.</i>

244
00:35:11.893 --> 00:35:15.833
<i>But she discovered a sound in the castle of the Beast,
stronger and more beautiful than a chime,</i>


245
00:35:16.623 --> 00:35:18.683
<i>that was resonating.</i>

246
00:35:19.403 --> 00:35:21.663
<i>It was a heartbeat.</i>

247
00:35:57.093 --> 00:35:58.973
My name is Belle.

248
00:35:59.073 --> 00:36:02.313
I have come to offer my
life in exchange for my father's.

249
00:36:05.723 --> 00:36:07.758
Sit.

250
00:36:39.623 --> 00:36:41.315
Eat.

251
00:36:43.113 --> 00:36:45.363
When you regain your strength,

252
00:36:45.543 --> 00:36:49.339
You will be able to wander
wherever you want in my estate.


253
00:36:49.783 --> 00:36:53.833
But when night falls,
I forbid you to go out of the castle.


254
00:36:54.733 --> 00:36:58.287
If I must die, let it be now.

255
00:37:00.093 --> 00:37:02.440
You have more courage than your father.

256
00:37:03.563 --> 00:37:08.553
Every night, at this time,
you will have to be here.


257
00:37:08.903 --> 00:37:11.421
Don't even think about escaping.

258
00:37:11.963 --> 00:37:14.843
The forest would close over you.

259
00:37:28.593 --> 00:37:32.213
- Should I stop reading?
- No, I want to hear the rest.


260
00:37:32.343 --> 00:37:38.333
- It is so sad. But it's nice.
- Yeah, she's all alone.


261
00:37:39.383 --> 00:37:43.473
As she climbed the stairs,
Belle realized,


262
00:37:43.813 --> 00:37:47.833
that throughout her life,
her nights would pass alone.


263
00:37:48.253 --> 00:37:50.144
What she didn't know.

264
00:37:50.281 --> 00:37:53.487
<i>Was that her bedroom waiting
for her, were the "tadomi",</i>


265
00:37:53.663 --> 00:37:56.093
<i>little creatures, which
inhabitanted the castle,</i>


266
00:37:56.243 --> 00:37:59.693
<i>they were to become
her best friends.</i>


267
00:40:31.183 --> 00:40:36.659
- Am I beautiful?
- Beautiful, smart, gentle...


268
00:40:36.968 --> 00:40:41.275
- Most desirable.
- It will to please The Prince.


269
00:40:41.443 --> 00:40:44.398
Then...you will have to
to deal with my brother.


270
00:40:47.943 --> 00:40:49.453
Here they come.

271
00:41:17.863 --> 00:41:20.233
I always knew that it was true.

272
00:41:21.963 --> 00:41:23.643
Now I will eat you.

273
00:41:35.533 --> 00:41:40.903
- Get your filthy hands off.
- Yes, the problem with that, my friend, is that without effort...


274
00:41:41.013 --> 00:41:42.533
There is no reward.

275
00:41:43.383 --> 00:41:47.213
- Will you ever stop hunt her down?
- For years, eludes me.


276
00:41:47.323 --> 00:41:51.587
But I know that I kill her sometime.
She will be my greatest trophy.


277
00:41:52.664 --> 00:41:54.664
After you.

278
00:41:56.153 --> 00:42:01.052
Look what I gave him.
All gold, like the skin of the deer.


279
00:42:02.367 --> 00:42:04.740
Come on.
My throat is dry.


280
00:42:04.840 --> 00:42:06.962
I need a drink.

281
00:42:25.773 --> 00:42:28.227
He could still come to me.

282
00:42:29.783 --> 00:42:31.583
What is he waiting for?

283
00:42:49.783 --> 00:42:51.607
You smell like a beast.

284
00:43:10.003 --> 00:43:13.943
My love, I want to ask you something.

285
00:43:14.043 --> 00:43:18.073
- Something?
- I want to give up on this deer.


286
00:43:25.953 --> 00:43:30.703
- Why?
- With days was hunting her.


287
00:43:32.303 --> 00:43:36.819
I feel terribly lonely here without you.

288
00:43:39.473 --> 00:43:41.143
Alright.

289
00:43:42.483 --> 00:43:44.513
I have a condition.

290
00:43:45.602 --> 00:43:47.629
Give me a son.

291
00:44:24.063 --> 00:44:29.463
<i>Belle left her room,
hoping Beast was not around.</i>


292
00:44:30.713 --> 00:44:34.040
<i>There were more attractive locations for her.</i>

293
00:44:34.203 --> 00:44:38.823
<i>She wanted to see on her own and
examine the limits from his prison.</i>


294
00:46:49.026 --> 00:46:50.652
The Princess!

295
00:46:51.583 --> 00:46:54.273
<i>Belle realized that many years ago,</i>

296
00:46:54.453 --> 00:46:56.483
<i>maybe even centuries ago,</i>

297
00:46:56.653 --> 00:47:01.324
<i>Another woman lived, loved
and died in this damn castle.</i>


298
00:47:01.453 --> 00:47:04.555
<i>"Why are you so sad?"
She asked statue.</i>


299
00:47:04.655 --> 00:47:06.794
<i>"What's your secret?"</i>

300
00:47:06.894 --> 00:47:10.147
<i>Overcome with sorrow,
Belle ran to her room,</i>


301
00:47:10.323 --> 00:47:14.889
<i>Awaiting for her meeting with the Beast.</i>

302
00:47:16.136 --> 00:47:18.493
You're late!

303
00:47:23.513 --> 00:47:27.983
- Do you like the new gown?
- You were in my bedroom?


304
00:47:28.523 --> 00:47:31.733
- I'll remind you that I have the rights to everything.
- We shall see.


305
00:47:35.423 --> 00:47:38.373
Don't look at me. Eat!

306
00:47:38.667 --> 00:47:41.323
- Don't you eat?
- No.


307
00:47:41.718 --> 00:47:43.253
Not in front of you.

308
00:47:43.753 --> 00:47:46.633
Can I talk
or be silent as a child?


309
00:47:46.823 --> 00:47:49.393
But that's what you are,
an arrogant child.


310
00:47:50.153 --> 00:47:53.173
I'd rather you think that
I were innocent and foolish.

311
00:47:53.273 --> 00:47:55.473
- So...
- You talk too much!


312
00:48:03.243 --> 00:48:06.563
I'm sure that would pleases you.
Me dying without knowing anything.


313
00:48:08.130 --> 00:48:11.223
- Whose castle is this?
- Everything here is mine.


314
00:48:12.213 --> 00:48:13.980
You talk like every other man.

315
00:48:14.298 --> 00:48:15.888
It's a little disappointing.

316
00:48:20.013 --> 00:48:22.544
Are you are disappointed in me, my love?

317
00:48:23.294 --> 00:48:26.475
Are there other things
about me that disappoint you?

318
00:48:31.383 --> 00:48:33.295
Nothing more to say?

319
00:48:33.473 --> 00:48:36.165
Night and day I
hope you decide my fate.

320
00:48:36.665 --> 00:48:39.776
Playing with me like
a cat would a mouse.


321
00:48:39.876 --> 00:48:41.787
If you accept me as I am,

322
00:48:42.789 --> 00:48:44.969
I could fulfill all that you desire.

323
00:48:45.282 --> 00:48:48.043
Do you think a beast like you,
could have a woman like me?


324
00:48:52.763 --> 00:48:55.678
Look at me!
Look at me!


325
00:48:56.153 --> 00:48:57.763
I know what I am!

326
00:48:58.713 --> 00:49:00.493
Resist me all you wish,

327
00:49:01.753 --> 00:49:03.280
But you will be mine.

328
00:49:34.772 --> 00:49:39.061
"Eat." "Do not look at me."
"This. Do you like it?"!


329
00:49:39.382 --> 00:49:41.525
I'll teach him some manners!

330
00:50:01.593 --> 00:50:03.325
What is this?

331
00:50:05.333 --> 00:50:07.003
But that's me!

332
00:50:07.803 --> 00:50:09.777
My hidden portrait.

333
00:50:10.836 --> 00:50:12.763
What a wonderful gift!

334
00:50:22.093 --> 00:50:25.732
I wonder which of you
made this beautiful doll?


335
00:50:31.234 --> 00:50:33.428
Where are you hiding?

336
00:50:33.528 --> 00:50:35.835
I won't eat you.

337
00:50:44.333 --> 00:50:47.997
I'll leave you here.
It will always be close to me.


338
00:51:57.063 --> 00:51:58.643
Friends,

339
00:51:59.593 --> 00:52:01.203
Today is a great day.

340
00:52:02.593 --> 00:52:05.893
Our kingdom will finally have an heir.

341
00:52:14.553 --> 00:52:16.355
And you, Madam?

342
00:52:16.482 --> 00:52:19.307
How wouldant to make an heir?

343
00:52:19.473 --> 00:52:24.481
- For starters, get your own Kingdom.
- Let us hope that he's not like his father.


344
00:52:29.273 --> 00:52:33.911
- What are you thinking about?
- The first time we met.


345
00:52:34.011 --> 00:52:35.814
The river.

346
00:52:37.233 --> 00:52:41.643
You stayed close to shore
and pretended to undress.


347
00:52:43.993 --> 00:52:45.723
It seemed to me that you were drowning.

348
00:52:47.593 --> 00:52:49.483
I swam better than you did.

349
00:52:54.663 --> 00:52:56.720
What if we were
go back to our room?

350
00:53:00.085 --> 00:53:02.055
Don't forget your promise.

351
00:53:03.723 --> 00:53:05.263
What?

352
00:53:07.713 --> 00:53:09.253
The golden deer.

353
00:53:45.853 --> 00:53:49.213
<i>Upon awakening,
Belle began exploring the castle,</i>


354
00:53:49.653 --> 00:53:52.663
<i>She was determined to uncover
the mystery of The Beast.</i>

355
00:53:53.563 --> 00:53:56.553
<i>She was lost in the beautiful
corridors and passageways.</i>


356
00:53:56.693 --> 00:54:01.780
<i>Yet, she had the strange feeling
that she was being followed.</i>


357
00:56:15.867 --> 00:56:18.414
I want to apologize for last night.

358
00:56:20.113 --> 00:56:24.872
There is a reason,
You fill a great emptiness.


359
00:56:27.623 --> 00:56:29.649
Do you like my gifts?

360
00:56:31.803 --> 00:56:35.043
- Why are you silent?
- I miss my family.


361
00:56:36.853 --> 00:56:39.623
Forget them.
They no longer exist.


362
00:56:39.743 --> 00:56:42.211
You may be fine with never
thinking about your past


363
00:56:42.610 --> 00:56:46.140
- But I haven't given mine up.
- What do you know about me? Nothing!


364
00:56:46.303 --> 00:56:50.053
Nothing. You are right.

365
00:56:51.853 --> 00:56:53.733
I'm offering you a deal.

366
00:56:55.643 --> 00:57:00.623
- A few hours with my family.
- <i>In exchange what?</i>


367
00:57:01.943 --> 00:57:03.443
One dance.

368
00:57:06.203 --> 00:57:07.853
In return I want to see them.

369
00:57:08.603 --> 00:57:10.259
Are you challenging me?

370
00:57:11.142 --> 00:57:13.348
<i>I won't go back on my word.</i>

371
00:58:23.153 --> 00:58:25.648
Dancing isn't going to save you.

372
00:58:27.633 --> 00:58:29.173
Let yourself go.

373
00:59:59.808 --> 01:00:01.678
Could you love me?

374
01:00:05.943 --> 01:00:09.443
We had a deal.
Keep your promise.


375
01:00:10.073 --> 01:00:13.573
It's been a long time
since I promised anything to anyone.

376
01:00:15.863 --> 01:00:18.124
You may wear the clothes of a prince,

377
01:00:18.483 --> 01:00:22.913
You may think you're a man.
But you're no more than a cruel and lonely beast.


378
01:00:23.063 --> 01:00:28.162
You can try anything. Buy me, charm me.
You will only disgust me! You'll never have me!


379
01:03:29.707 --> 01:03:32.148
Now you know who I am!

380
01:03:33.483 --> 01:03:37.203
Tell me again that I repulse you!
Tell me!


381
01:04:35.573 --> 01:04:39.374
I'll let you see your
family one last time.


382
01:04:40.239 --> 01:04:44.327
Really? Will you allow me?

383
01:04:47.083 --> 01:04:49.143
I'll give you one day.

384
01:04:49.753 --> 01:04:53.223
I can give you no more than that.
Get dressed.


385
01:05:24.053 --> 01:05:26.771
- Give me your hand.
- Which one?


386
01:05:27.003 --> 01:05:29.313
I don't know. Does not matter. Left.

387
01:05:29.873 --> 01:05:33.493
- You're not going give me a ring, are you?
- Stop talking for a minute.


388
01:05:34.813 --> 01:05:36.363
Listen to me.

389
01:05:40.233 --> 01:05:42.303
You know the power of this water.

390
01:05:43.053 --> 01:05:45.263
If, by chance, you get hurt...

391
01:05:47.603 --> 01:05:50.903
- If anything were to happen to you...
- Nothing will happen.


392
01:05:51.553 --> 01:05:53.203
I need to get ready!

393
01:05:59.053 --> 01:06:04.133
- Belle, if you don't come back...
- You'll kill everyone?


394
01:06:05.123 --> 01:06:06.225
No.

395
01:06:07.502 --> 01:06:09.198
I'll die.

396
01:06:14.609 --> 01:06:15.987
I will be here tomorrow.

397
01:06:16.560 --> 01:06:18.159
At this very hour.

398
01:06:37.843 --> 01:06:39.260
Who's there?

399
01:06:39.395 --> 01:06:41.047
You should know
that we're armed!


400
01:06:45.313 --> 01:06:46.781
Belle!

401
01:07:14.983 --> 01:07:16.923
Look at this mess!

402
01:07:17.113 --> 01:07:20.063
- What do you need weapons for?
- Ask Maxim.


403
01:07:20.173 --> 01:07:23.933
- Shut up and go back to your post.
- Back to my post?


404
01:07:24.033 --> 01:07:26.951
- What, do you think you're a Ganeral?
- Enough, enough.


405
01:07:27.051 --> 01:07:29.673
- There you go again.
- Stop defending him.


406
01:07:30.013 --> 01:07:33.173
- All day hiding in fear.
- Me scared?


407
01:07:33.273 --> 01:07:35.903
- Enough! Stop it!
- What is this?


408
01:07:36.073 --> 01:07:37.673
Have you all gone mad?

409
01:07:41.673 --> 01:07:45.550
Come on.
It'll all be fine.


410
01:07:45.663 --> 01:07:48.827
Do you really think they'll sell us
as slaves to pay for Maxim's debts?


411
01:07:48.927 --> 01:07:51.535
They'll put us on a ship
full of swarthy sailors.


412
01:07:52.443 --> 01:07:54.606
Where they'll force us
to scrub the decks?


413
01:07:55.013 --> 01:07:58.957
We'll tell them that we get sea sick
We'll say that we don't know how to do housecleaning.


414
01:07:59.057 --> 01:08:00.857
Good idea.

415
01:08:02.264 --> 01:08:03.655
Anne.

416
01:08:04.623 --> 01:08:06.203
Clotilde.

417
01:08:07.503 --> 01:08:11.623
- I'm back.
- Clotilde, are you seeing what I'm seeing?


418
01:08:11.723 --> 01:08:14.654
The Ghost of Belle
Back to haunt us.


419
01:08:14.833 --> 01:08:18.767
- All in red, bathed in blood.
- Don't you see me, my dear sisters.


420
01:08:19.403 --> 01:08:23.221
Really I'm still me.
I came to say my last goodbye..


421
01:08:23.383 --> 01:08:27.383
- Even dead is more beautiful than us.
- Just look at her waist.


422
01:08:27.482 --> 01:08:29.792
Know that I will love you forever.

423
01:08:29.818 --> 01:08:32.377
And we you, with all out heart.
We think of you always.


424
01:08:32.463 --> 01:08:37.015
- She made me to pick up your room.
- What have you done?


425
01:08:37.115 --> 01:08:39.406
I will have my revenge.

426
01:08:42.353 --> 01:08:43.903
Where's Papa?

427
01:08:44.033 --> 01:08:47.678
After you left, he went to bed
and did not want to wake up.


428
01:08:52.923 --> 01:08:55.075
What an exqusite gown!

429
01:09:01.213 --> 01:09:02.952
Papa?

430
01:09:08.213 --> 01:09:10.514
It is me.

431
01:09:10.614 --> 01:09:12.614
Belle.

432
01:09:14.014 --> 01:09:15.514
I'm here.

433
01:09:19.603 --> 01:09:21.203
Come back, Papa!

434
01:09:23.863 --> 01:09:25.553
Do it for me.

435
01:09:28.726 --> 01:09:30.295
Papa.

436
01:09:31.095 --> 01:09:32.695
Papa.

437
01:09:42.193 --> 01:09:44.223
Have you ever seen
a stone of this size?

438
01:09:46.313 --> 01:09:49.303
- Remember the trunk Father brought back from the castle?
- I won't let you!


439
01:09:49.403 --> 01:09:52.613
- This is our only chance, Tristan.
- You won't pass through this door alive.


440
01:11:21.253 --> 01:11:24.840
Look how her back trembles.
How brilliant her coat.


441
01:11:25.673 --> 01:11:27.973
You can almost feel her scent.

442
01:11:28.073 --> 01:11:28.976
It's time.

443
01:11:29.002 --> 01:11:31.078
She's mine, okay?

444
01:14:00.473 --> 01:14:03.533
I'm a woodland nymph.

445
01:14:06.940 --> 01:14:09.983
I had the right
to take a human form.

446
01:14:11.918 --> 01:14:15.025
I wanted to know what they called ...Love.

447
01:14:18.673 --> 01:14:21.172
I found it in you.

448
01:14:21.273 --> 01:14:23.864
- My Prince.
- Forgive me.


449
01:14:34.323 --> 01:14:36.008
Father!

450
01:14:40.638 --> 01:14:42.193
God of the forest.

451
01:14:45.343 --> 01:14:47.199
Spare my beloved.

452
01:14:48.563 --> 01:14:52.013
He has filled your daughter's
life with an everlasting love.


453
01:14:52.692 --> 01:14:54.175
Father...

454
01:14:54.717 --> 01:14:56.528
Spare him.

455
01:15:36.913 --> 01:15:40.198
<i>Thunderous voice was heard from heaven.</i>

456
01:15:40.388 --> 01:15:44.013
<i>"For having killed my daughter,
I shall turn him into a beast.</i>


457
01:15:44.198 --> 01:15:46.597
<i>"Only a woman can save you.</i>

458
01:15:46.698 --> 01:15:51.257
<i>"But who will want to love you?
You will be cursed for all time!"</i>


459
01:16:08.463 --> 01:16:10.389
We should wait for Belle to enter.

460
01:16:11.236 --> 01:16:14.693
I'm going.
She'll understand.


461
01:16:15.433 --> 01:16:17.732
You'd rather have had another brother, right?

462
01:16:27.813 --> 01:16:30.023
What are you doing here, bunnies?

463
01:16:30.483 --> 01:16:32.708
Were we not going to
meet again in Tabicoc?


464
01:16:32.962 --> 01:16:33.713
Look.

465
01:16:34.413 --> 01:16:37.457
I've arranged for some of the
boys to meet your sisters.


466
01:16:39.913 --> 01:16:43.473
- Offering you a deal.
- That what deals do you have?


467
01:16:43.653 --> 01:16:45.203
This I can't wait to hear.

468
01:16:47.173 --> 01:16:48.713
Look.

469
01:16:49.863 --> 01:16:54.593
From abandoned castle.
Take all the treasure, and erase my debt.


470
01:16:59.953 --> 01:17:03.845
- How much are we talking about?
- Trunks full.


471
01:17:05.963 --> 01:17:10.794
Don't fool me, sweetheart.
This is your last chance.


472
01:17:11.123 --> 01:17:13.248
Have your boys follow me.

473
01:17:15.733 --> 01:17:17.383
Do as he says.

474
01:17:23.773 --> 01:17:25.850
"More than anything in the world."

475
01:17:36.563 --> 01:17:39.232
<i>As they rode through the
enchanted path,</i>


476
01:17:39.332 --> 01:17:42.136
<i>Pereducas dreamt about the treasure,</i>

477
01:17:42.236 --> 01:17:45.633
<i>And his people are dreaming
how they would share it.</i>


478
01:17:45.783 --> 01:17:50.743
<i>He looked Astrid and wondered if
he preferd love or wealth.</i>


479
01:17:50.913 --> 01:17:55.593
Sometimes the soul gets confused.
All of your beliefs vanish and you are left with only doubts.


480
01:17:55.763 --> 01:17:59.763
<i>Meanwhile, Belle dreamed how
The Prince became The Beast.</i>


481
01:17:59.933 --> 01:18:02.941
<i>Until, suddenly, it grew into great anguish.</i>

482
01:18:35.793 --> 01:18:37.403
My little girl!

483
01:18:41.753 --> 01:18:43.639
I missed you so much!

484
01:18:45.493 --> 01:18:47.133
Belle!

485
01:18:49.693 --> 01:18:54.543
Anne! Clotilde!
Come quickly!


486
01:18:55.183 --> 01:18:56.843
I was so scared.

487
01:18:59.343 --> 01:19:01.564
Something in you has changed.

488
01:19:02.093 --> 01:19:03.915
Your eyes.

489
01:19:05.683 --> 01:19:09.278
- And your voice...
- I have to go, Papa.


490
01:19:10.605 --> 01:19:12.803
I can't be late.

491
01:19:19.303 --> 01:19:23.360
- What a miracle!
- The happiest day of my life!


492
01:19:24.473 --> 01:19:27.653
Stop, or you'll crush me, my girls!

493
01:19:59.403 --> 01:20:01.353
Do you feel something?

494
01:20:02.183 --> 01:20:05.199
Danger. Everywhere.

495
01:20:12.383 --> 01:20:14.373
Just the way I like it.

496
01:20:18.473 --> 01:20:20.063
Come on.

497
01:20:20.203 --> 01:20:22.273
You three west.

498
01:20:23.013 --> 01:20:25.723
And you, take the east.

499
01:20:26.363 --> 01:20:29.253
And you go ahead of me.

500
01:21:53.128 --> 01:21:54.738
<i>Astrid!</i>

501
01:21:55.443 --> 01:21:57.553
<i>Astrid, come here!</i>

502
01:22:13.261 --> 01:22:16.729
Brother, I have to hurry.

503
01:22:18.433 --> 01:22:20.571
Maxim took the horse.

504
01:22:20.703 --> 01:22:24.263
I know I should have told you earlier,
forgive me, Belle.


505
01:22:52.706 --> 01:22:53.999
Come on!
Hurry up!


506
01:23:03.183 --> 01:23:07.133
I hate when you're not near me.
Where were you?


507
01:23:07.263 --> 01:23:10.753
If I tell you to leave immediately,
will you follow?


508
01:23:12.103 --> 01:23:15.403
- Gold!
- This arrow is powerful.


509
01:23:15.533 --> 01:23:18.710
I feel that there is much more wealth.

510
01:23:18.810 --> 01:23:21.688
We will be respected.
We will have it all.


511
01:23:21.883 --> 01:23:23.827
<i>Open your eyes.</i>

512
01:23:23.993 --> 01:23:26.744
We got what we always wanted.

513
01:23:32.574 --> 01:23:36.613
How do I know you will come back and
get my treasure?


514
01:23:36.763 --> 01:23:40.913
If you no longer believe me,
At least believe in the prophecy of my cards.


515
01:23:41.013 --> 01:23:43.753
- What have you seen?
- Death.


516
01:23:44.603 --> 01:23:48.589
- Yours or mine?
- Which do you prefer?


517
01:23:48.689 --> 01:23:50.717
Neither, dear.

518
01:23:52.103 --> 01:23:55.583
And as you are not sure of anything,
but let's say that there is,


519
01:23:55.723 --> 01:23:58.163
It will die tonight.

520
01:24:05.633 --> 01:24:07.153
Well?

521
01:24:07.393 --> 01:24:10.073
This gate won't open itself.

522
01:25:05.683 --> 01:25:07.823
Abandoned castle, huh?

523
01:25:50.663 --> 01:25:54.463
Relax, bastards.
In this castle has many floors.


524
01:26:13.343 --> 01:26:15.163
We have to find another way.

525
01:26:16.793 --> 01:26:20.589
The ribbon I lost on the way to the castle.
So not far away.


526
01:26:23.343 --> 01:26:24.903
Belle, what are you doing?

527
01:26:25.183 --> 01:26:26.773
Belle stop that, you'll hurt yourself.

528
01:26:28.093 --> 01:26:30.953
Belle, come back!
Come back, Belle!


529
01:26:33.493 --> 01:26:35.143
Please, Belle, come back!

530
01:26:35.653 --> 01:26:37.203
Belle!

531
01:27:14.943 --> 01:27:16.603
God of the forest,

532
01:27:17.503 --> 01:27:19.083
Hear my plea,

533
01:27:21.293 --> 01:27:23.355
Let me go back to him.

534
01:27:23.455 --> 01:27:25.674
It's my only wish.

535
01:27:27.235 --> 01:27:29.044
This is my only desire.

536
01:28:10.733 --> 01:28:13.933
Here's our gold.
There was no one inside.


537
01:28:14.903 --> 01:28:18.553
Don't spoil the fun.
I'm rich, now.


538
01:28:19.406 --> 01:28:21.823
I can fulfill your every desire.

539
01:28:21.933 --> 01:28:26.329
- We will die together.
- Your cards don't decide anymore.


540
01:28:26.429 --> 01:28:28.127
I do.

541
01:29:42.483 --> 01:29:44.717
What is it?
Why is he screaming like that?


542
01:32:10.508 --> 01:32:13.381
- Where are our brothers?
- At the gate with Perducas.


543
01:32:19.447 --> 01:32:21.290
He'll kill them!

544
01:32:45.016 --> 01:32:46.672
Maxim!

545
01:32:52.796 --> 01:32:55.065
Save yourself.
Tell Belle I ask for forgiveness.


546
01:32:55.165 --> 01:32:57.125
- No.
- I said get out!


547
01:32:57.538 --> 01:32:59.552
Tell her that.

548
01:33:11.318 --> 01:33:12.834
Stop!

549
01:33:23.880 --> 01:33:25.631
Hello, little one.

550
01:33:25.910 --> 01:33:27.555
Now you will help me.

551
01:33:35.303 --> 01:33:36.903
Let her go!

552
01:33:38.794 --> 01:33:41.126
What are you?

553
01:33:41.523 --> 01:33:45.743
- A lion? A big cat?
- One who will tear apart.


554
01:33:46.043 --> 01:33:48.379
Purr all you want.

555
01:33:48.563 --> 01:33:50.673
But if you don't want me
to destroy your doll,


556
01:33:51.301 --> 01:33:52.878
you will you
let me go.


557
01:34:29.463 --> 01:34:31.113
I beg you!

558
01:34:32.353 --> 01:34:34.673
Remember, you were once a man!

559
01:34:35.753 --> 01:34:39.133
And among these
thieves are my brothers.


560
01:34:40.945 --> 01:34:42.998
The important thing is that I'm here.

561
01:34:43.198 --> 01:34:45.011
And I'm going to stay with you.

562
01:35:32.373 --> 01:35:34.209
Help me!

563
01:35:44.108 --> 01:35:46.552
Come on, quick!

564
01:36:49.481 --> 01:36:51.896
<i>Don't leave me!</i>

565
01:37:04.673 --> 01:37:07.571
My love, your fate
will be worse than mine.

566
01:37:23.573 --> 01:37:25.653
Close the door!

567
01:37:26.073 --> 01:37:27.933
Hurry!

568
01:37:33.503 --> 01:37:35.138
Come on, quick!

569
01:38:04.103 --> 01:38:05.883
He's not breathing.

570
01:38:13.708 --> 01:38:16.350
Stay with water.
Brothers, come on.


571
01:39:15.193 --> 01:39:17.803
We missed dinner.

572
01:39:22.093 --> 01:39:24.493
You say that like you regret it.

573
01:39:26.673 --> 01:39:28.203
Belle.

574
01:39:29.453 --> 01:39:30.857
Do you think...

575
01:39:31.773 --> 01:39:33.338
With a little patience,

576
01:39:34.693 --> 01:39:36.543
Maybe you could
get used to me?


577
01:39:38.303 --> 01:39:39.903
And maybe you could...

578
01:39:41.443 --> 01:39:43.529
Love me?

579
01:39:46.841 --> 01:39:48.861
But I already love you.

580
01:42:13.793 --> 01:42:15.603
<i>The End</i>

581
01:42:16.293 --> 01:42:18.153
Time for bed.

582
01:42:19.662 --> 01:42:21.473
Come on.

583
01:42:31.953 --> 01:42:34.923
And her brothers and sisters?
What happened to them?


584
01:42:35.483 --> 01:42:37.201
They all returned to town.

585
01:42:37.332 --> 01:42:39.423
Her brother published his book.

586
01:42:39.763 --> 01:42:42.288
And her sisters ended
up marrying twins


587
01:42:42.314 --> 01:42:44.838
they never managed
to distinguish them.


588
01:42:44.963 --> 01:42:48.848
So they were all together?
And her father?


589
01:42:49.033 --> 01:42:51.203
He opened a flower shop.

590
01:42:51.383 --> 01:42:54.824
- He did?
- Yes, he did.


591
01:42:57.507 --> 01:42:59.126
Sweet dreams.

592
01:43:02.827 --> 01:43:05.606
- Mama.
- Sleep, honey.
