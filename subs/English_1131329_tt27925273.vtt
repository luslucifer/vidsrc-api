00:03:26.527 --> 00:03:29.030
<i>What's taking so long?</i>

2
00:03:41.292 --> 00:03:44.920
Let me go first!
We’re family friends, right?


3
00:03:44.921 --> 00:03:46.004
They haven't come out yet?

4
00:03:46.005 --> 00:03:47.840
They're taking forever.

5
00:04:03.564 --> 00:04:05.857
For real? A quickie in the bathroom?

6
00:04:05.858 --> 00:04:07.652
<i>Can you hurry it up?</i>

7
00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:10.655
Come, girl! Come out!

8
00:04:11.906 --> 00:04:13.950
<i>Aww jeez.</i>

9
00:04:14.492 --> 00:04:16.911
You don't care, do you?

10
00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:24.002
Joey?!

11
00:04:24.335 --> 00:04:25.253
Chris?!

12
00:04:25.254 --> 00:04:27.422
You're back together?

13
00:04:45.982 --> 00:04:49.485
- How are you? Congratulations!
- You too!


14
00:04:57.368 --> 00:04:59.287
Excuse me! Move! Move!

15
00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.419
Congrats, love!

16
00:05:09.881 --> 00:05:12.215
Congratulations, my cum laude.

17
00:05:12.216 --> 00:05:14.677
Where should we celebrate?

18
00:05:21.726 --> 00:05:24.437
Sorry, I just got excited.

19
00:05:25.813 --> 00:05:29.317
Obviously, because this is such
an exciting event.


20
00:05:33.237 --> 00:05:36.157
Sandra, I don't think smoking
is allowed here.


21
00:05:39.243 --> 00:05:40.577
So, <i>hija,</i> tell me.

22
00:05:40.578 --> 00:05:43.038
Where are you gonna celebrate later?

23
00:05:43.039 --> 00:05:44.956
Chris! Chris!

24
00:05:44.957 --> 00:05:46.917
Congratulations, honey!

25
00:05:46.918 --> 00:05:48.919
I finished it!

26
00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:50.963
It's your turn next!

27
00:05:54.884 --> 00:05:57.219
Now, honey, you've graduated.

28
00:05:57.220 --> 00:05:58.720
Are you ready to be…

29
00:05:58.721 --> 00:06:00.138
jobless?

30
00:06:00.139 --> 00:06:02.100
I know, right.

31
00:06:02.517 --> 00:06:03.893
Anyway...

32
00:06:04.227 --> 00:06:07.229
Hang on, are they my future in-laws?

33
00:06:07.230 --> 00:06:08.898
Ah! Oh my goodness!

34
00:06:09.232 --> 00:06:10.816
You know what, don't worry.

35
00:06:10.817 --> 00:06:12.192
I already talked to Chris.

36
00:06:12.193 --> 00:06:13.443
And I told her, of course,

37
00:06:13.444 --> 00:06:16.197
to prioritize work and her art.

38
00:06:16.697 --> 00:06:17.906
Am I right?

39
00:06:17.907 --> 00:06:19.533
As for you two,

40
00:06:19.534 --> 00:06:21.368
safe s♪x!

41
00:06:21.369 --> 00:06:22.828
You know what I mean!

42
00:06:22.829 --> 00:06:23.329
Sorry.

43
00:06:23.329 --> 00:06:24.288
It's true, right?

44
00:06:24.289 --> 00:06:26.249
I'm just being prac... 
It's true, yes?

45
00:06:28.918 --> 00:06:31.628
It's okay, love.

46
00:06:31.629 --> 00:06:32.712
I'm so proud of you.

47
00:06:32.713 --> 00:06:34.507
<i>Hijo</i>, congratulations.

48
00:06:55.736 --> 00:06:58.573
<i>Adulting. Here we go.</i>

49
00:06:58.739 --> 00:07:01.491
<i>Thank you of course
to Mom and Dad for this gift.</i>


50
00:07:01.492 --> 00:07:04.245
<i>Finally, I've got my own place.</i>

51
00:07:04.745 --> 00:07:07.707
<i>Okay. This is it.</i>

52
00:07:07.915 --> 00:07:09.791
<i>Wow! This is so nice.</i>

53
00:07:09.792 --> 00:07:11.794
<i>I wish I had one for myself.</i>

54
00:07:36.861 --> 00:07:38.529
<i>My sweetheart.</i>

55
00:07:38.905 --> 00:07:41.699
<i>I want you to be
the queen of this place.</i>

56
00:07:42.408 --> 00:07:45.453
<i>Queen of your heart.</i>

57
00:07:45.995 --> 00:07:46.995
<i>Love.</i>

58
00:08:03.137 --> 00:08:04.555
Why?

59
00:08:05.514 --> 00:08:06.807
Because.

60
00:08:07.350 --> 00:08:10.102
Because... why?
What's this?


61
00:08:10.436 --> 00:08:12.312
Because it's cute!

62
00:08:12.313 --> 00:08:14.398
It suits your personality!

63
00:08:14.607 --> 00:08:18.569
Serious but with a cute side.

64
00:08:18.986 --> 00:08:20.529
Mm…

65
00:08:21.072 --> 00:08:24.824
For me, Chris, everything in life
has to have a purpose.


66
00:08:24.825 --> 00:08:27.494
From the things you put in your house

67
00:08:27.495 --> 00:08:30.830
to the people you keep in your life.

68
00:08:30.831 --> 00:08:33.417
Because if there's no purpose,
what's the point?


69
00:08:33.793 --> 00:08:34.919
Beauty…

70
00:08:35.127 --> 00:08:36.795
is the point.

71
00:08:36.796 --> 00:08:40.549
And besides, it reminds me of something.

72
00:08:41.801 --> 00:08:43.052
What?

73
00:08:43.552 --> 00:08:45.054
You don't remember?

74
00:08:46.013 --> 00:08:47.264
This.

75
00:08:47.265 --> 00:08:48.516
Your umbrella.

76
00:08:50.226 --> 00:08:51.269
Right?

77
00:08:51.560 --> 00:08:52.560
It's cute!

78
00:08:52.728 --> 00:08:53.271
Okay.

79
00:08:53.271 --> 00:08:54.271
Fine.

80
00:09:31.392 --> 00:09:35.187
My baby smells so good. Damn!

81
00:09:36.647 --> 00:09:37.856
Wait..

82
00:09:37.857 --> 00:09:39.482
Did you brush your teeth already?

83
00:09:39.483 --> 00:09:40.942
No?

84
00:09:40.943 --> 00:09:42.652
Was my breath ever stinky?

85
00:09:42.653 --> 00:09:44.571
Jeez. I was just kidding.

86
00:09:44.572 --> 00:09:46.365
It's too early to be grumpy.

87
00:09:46.616 --> 00:09:48.409
I'm a Leo, remember?

88
00:09:50.953 --> 00:09:52.203
What time is it anyway?

89
00:09:52.204 --> 00:09:53.664
6:30 a.m?

90
00:09:54.248 --> 00:09:55.541
Huh?

91
00:09:56.709 --> 00:09:58.001
It's already 6:30?

92
00:09:58.002 --> 00:09:59.210
I’m gonna be late!

93
00:09:59.211 --> 00:10:00.337
You can still make it!

94
00:10:00.338 --> 00:10:02.089
Go! Go! Go!

95
00:10:09.263 --> 00:10:10.389
How's my hair?

96
00:10:11.098 --> 00:10:11.766
Deodorant!

97
00:10:11.766 --> 00:10:12.600
Okay! Okay!

98
00:10:12.601 --> 00:10:14.392
Here... Oh my god!

99
00:10:14.393 --> 00:10:15.977
There we go.

100
00:10:15.978 --> 00:10:16.479
Quickly!

101
00:10:16.479 --> 00:10:17.021
Sorry! Sorry!

102
00:10:17.022 --> 00:10:18.313
- Cute!
- Sure?


103
00:10:18.314 --> 00:10:18.898
Yes!

104
00:10:19.231 --> 00:10:20.650
- Shoot!
- Okay!


105
00:10:21.734 --> 00:10:22.777
Go! Go!

106
00:10:24.195 --> 00:10:25.112
How do I smell?

107
00:10:25.112 --> 00:10:26.072
Good!

108
00:10:26.072 --> 00:10:27.072
Socks! Don't forget.

109
00:10:27.281 --> 00:10:28.365
I'll put them on the way.
On the way.


110
00:10:28.366 --> 00:10:30.116
Sorry, sorry! Uhm…

111
00:10:30.117 --> 00:10:30.868
What is it?

112
00:10:30.868 --> 00:10:31.410
Glasses.

113
00:10:31.411 --> 00:10:32.494
Oh, right.

114
00:10:32.495 --> 00:10:33.495
Okay.

115
00:10:33.496 --> 00:10:35.038
Wait, oh my god. Your hair.

116
00:10:35.039 --> 00:10:35.748
Okay.

117
00:10:35.748 --> 00:10:36.457
How am I?

118
00:10:36.457 --> 00:10:37.249
I love you.

119
00:10:37.249 --> 00:10:37.792
Goodbye.

120
00:10:37.792 --> 00:10:38.751
- Bye.
- Okay. I'm late.


121
00:10:38.751 --> 00:10:39.168
Bye!

122
00:10:39.168 --> 00:10:39.543
Late.

123
00:10:39.543 --> 00:10:40.543
Bye!

124
00:10:41.045 --> 00:10:43.297
- Watch.
- Yes! Go!


125
00:10:44.757 --> 00:10:46.592
Oh my god.

126
00:11:08.823 --> 00:11:13.619
Love, I might come home late.
They need me on the show tonight.


127
00:11:16.956 --> 00:11:19.082
I thought you'll be backstage?

128
00:11:19.083 --> 00:11:21.709
Sorry, there were changes.

129
00:11:21.710 --> 00:11:25.923
But I'll try to come home early,
okay? I love you!


130
00:11:35.599 --> 00:11:38.226
Okay guys before we eat,

131
00:11:38.227 --> 00:11:43.606
let's give it up for this gal
who saved our show!


132
00:11:43.607 --> 00:11:45.609
Go, Chris!

133
00:11:46.277 --> 00:11:48.445
Thank you! Bravo! Bravo!

134
00:11:48.446 --> 00:11:51.448
Thank you, <i>Direk.</i>
Thank you for the opportunity!


135
00:11:51.449 --> 00:11:52.991
For our lady of the evening.

136
00:11:52.992 --> 00:11:54.535
Flowers?

137
00:12:04.753 --> 00:12:05.463
<i>Speech!</i>

138
00:12:05.464 --> 00:12:07.547
- What am I gonna say?
- Speech!


139
00:12:07.548 --> 00:12:10.718
- Speech!
- Speech!


140
00:12:18.392 --> 00:12:22.020
<i>To Sarah, I'm thankful you're unavailable.</i>

141
00:12:22.021 --> 00:12:23.730
If you were here,

142
00:12:23.731 --> 00:12:26.942
I wouldn't have had this chance
to play the lead.


143
00:12:28.319 --> 00:12:30.612
Congratulations on making it to Canada and…

144
00:12:30.613 --> 00:12:31.989
I'll make you proud.

145
00:12:33.616 --> 00:12:35.325
Thank you, <i>Direk.</i>
Thank you so much!


146
00:12:35.326 --> 00:12:36.869
Go on, have your dinner!

147
00:12:38.287 --> 00:12:39.705
Thank you so much.

148
00:13:05.814 --> 00:13:08.691
Love?

149
00:13:08.692 --> 00:13:11.110
Love, I'm sorry.

150
00:13:11.111 --> 00:13:15.198
I thought I could leave after the chorus
but the lead had an emergency.


151
00:13:15.199 --> 00:13:20.119
And as the understudy, I've memorized
all the lines so I stepped up.


152
00:13:20.120 --> 00:13:22.205
Sorry. Did you cook this?

153
00:13:22.206 --> 00:13:24.667
Come, let's eat.

154
00:13:27.127 --> 00:13:29.630
You could have at least called.

155
00:13:30.422 --> 00:13:31.923
I got really busy.

156
00:13:31.924 --> 00:13:33.466
I'm so sorry.

157
00:13:33.467 --> 00:13:35.803
Let's eat.
The food's been waiting.


158
00:13:41.308 --> 00:13:43.560
It's so good!

159
00:13:43.561 --> 00:13:45.728
Did you make this?

160
00:13:45.729 --> 00:13:46.814
Wow!

161
00:13:48.649 --> 00:13:49.857
Wow!

162
00:13:49.858 --> 00:13:51.058
- Try some!
- I'm going to bed.


163
00:13:52.278 --> 00:13:53.529
- I'm going to bed.
- Wait.


164
00:13:53.862 --> 00:13:55.113
Aren't you gonna join me?

165
00:13:55.114 --> 00:13:57.324
It won't take long.
Eat with me.


166
00:13:58.325 --> 00:14:02.162
Christina. I need to be up early
for my fieldwork, remember?


167
00:14:02.997 --> 00:14:04.205
Just enjoy the food.

168
00:14:04.206 --> 00:14:05.415
All right, fine.
I'll put these away.


169
00:14:05.416 --> 00:14:07.125
No! Don't. I cooked it for you.

170
00:14:07.126 --> 00:14:08.459
No, I'm good. I'll put these...

171
00:14:08.460 --> 00:14:09.587
Oh, love!

172
00:14:12.256 --> 00:14:12.840
I'll do it.

173
00:14:12.841 --> 00:14:14.008
No. Let me.

174
00:14:15.092 --> 00:14:16.217
- Let me do it.
- It's okay, love. I'll do it.


175
00:14:16.218 --> 00:14:17.510
- I'll take care of it.
- You should rest.


176
00:14:17.511 --> 00:14:19.429
You should get some rest.

177
00:14:19.430 --> 00:14:21.222
Leave it to me.

178
00:14:21.223 --> 00:14:22.850
Please.

179
00:14:26.478 --> 00:14:27.478
Go on.

180
00:14:41.994 --> 00:14:45.497
I thought we agreed.
No shoes in the bedroom.


181
00:14:58.218 --> 00:15:01.472
And why is the light
in the bathroom still on?


182
00:15:17.946 --> 00:15:19.114
Chris.

183
00:15:19.990 --> 00:15:22.451
I'm just trying to tell you something.

184
00:15:23.369 --> 00:15:27.455
You shoudn't agree to last minute
arrangements because look what happens.


185
00:15:27.456 --> 00:15:29.207
You end up getting short-changed.

186
00:15:29.208 --> 00:15:31.084
You'll get stressed and tired

187
00:15:31.085 --> 00:15:33.170
and in the end,
you'll be the one complaining.


188
00:15:33.879 --> 00:15:37.257
Love, I said I was sorry.

189
00:15:39.468 --> 00:15:44.056
But you know how important it is for me
to be the lead in a big production.


190
00:15:45.140 --> 00:15:46.683
It's my dream.

191
00:15:46.684 --> 00:15:48.477
And this might be my only chance.

192
00:15:50.229 --> 00:15:51.271
Hey.

193
00:15:51.689 --> 00:15:53.273
Don't get me wrong.

194
00:15:53.649 --> 00:15:55.400
I'm happy you got lead.

195
00:15:55.401 --> 00:15:57.111
I am.

196
00:15:58.028 --> 00:16:02.366
But it's our anniversary, you know?

197
00:16:02.908 --> 00:16:05.368
I know.

198
00:16:05.369 --> 00:16:07.120
I'm sorry.

199
00:16:07.121 --> 00:16:09.789
It's okay. I'm sorry, too.

200
00:16:09.790 --> 00:16:11.416
Friends?

201
00:16:11.417 --> 00:16:12.334
We're good?

202
00:16:12.334 --> 00:16:13.334
Mm-hm.

203
00:16:15.045 --> 00:16:16.170
Sure?

204
00:16:16.171 --> 00:16:17.380
Mm-hm.

205
00:16:17.381 --> 00:16:18.381
Kiss me first.

206
00:16:22.886 --> 00:16:24.221
Sorry.

207
00:16:25.055 --> 00:16:25.889
Sorry.

208
00:16:25.890 --> 00:16:28.225
I want a sweeter one.

209
00:16:28.851 --> 00:16:30.519
- Huh?
- No!


210
00:16:39.361 --> 00:16:40.696
Germany?

211
00:16:43.699 --> 00:16:45.200
You're leaving?

212
00:16:45.617 --> 00:16:48.411
For how long?
Why didn't you tell me?


213
00:16:48.412 --> 00:16:51.290
I bet you are gonna make
us all proud in Germany.


214
00:16:53.208 --> 00:16:54.792
Boss was asking you a question.

215
00:16:54.793 --> 00:16:56.002
He was talking to you.

216
00:16:56.003 --> 00:16:59.797
Yes, of course.
I will confirm as soon as I can.


217
00:16:59.798 --> 00:17:01.174
Make it fast.

218
00:17:01.175 --> 00:17:03.301
This opportunity comes once
in a blue moon.


219
00:17:03.302 --> 00:17:05.804
Not everyone is afforded
this kind of a chance.


220
00:17:07.139 --> 00:17:08.806
Yes, sir. I understand.

221
00:17:08.807 --> 00:17:10.433
Thank you, sir.

222
00:17:10.434 --> 00:17:12.978
Sir, excuse me.
I have to show you something.


223
00:17:13.479 --> 00:17:14.938
Excuse me.

224
00:17:17.900 --> 00:17:18.901
What?

225
00:17:19.401 --> 00:17:22.695
And here I was,
about to tell you I'm jealous.


226
00:17:22.696 --> 00:17:24.906
You, jealous? Since when?

227
00:17:24.907 --> 00:17:26.992
I thought you were gonna tease me.

228
00:17:27.618 --> 00:17:29.661
I mean, Yanz!

229
00:17:30.662 --> 00:17:32.706
How will I explain this to Chris?

230
00:17:32.915 --> 00:17:36.627
If she really loves you,
I'm sure she will understand.


231
00:17:37.044 --> 00:17:39.129
Doesn't she know how important this is?

232
00:17:40.547 --> 00:17:42.215
She will. She has to.

233
00:17:42.216 --> 00:17:42.966
Mm-hm.

234
00:17:42.967 --> 00:17:46.512
Just remember what a big opportunity
this is for you.


235
00:17:46.887 --> 00:17:48.305
And one more thing.

236
00:17:49.056 --> 00:17:50.097
What?

237
00:17:50.098 --> 00:17:51.098
What is it?

238
00:17:51.099 --> 00:17:53.810
Because you're so tense at the meeting,

239
00:17:53.811 --> 00:17:55.854
your coffee was spilling all over you.

240
00:17:56.355 --> 00:17:58.690
I was literally shaking.

241
00:17:59.149 --> 00:18:01.400
You didn't finish your soda water.

242
00:18:01.401 --> 00:18:02.861
Thank you.

243
00:18:05.697 --> 00:18:08.407
Relax.

244
00:18:08.408 --> 00:18:09.992
I need to use the bathroom.

245
00:18:09.993 --> 00:18:11.160
I gotta check this.

246
00:18:11.161 --> 00:18:12.328
Wipes? You need wipes for that?

247
00:18:12.329 --> 00:18:13.329
Wipes.

248
00:18:13.664 --> 00:18:14.789
Thank you.

249
00:18:14.790 --> 00:18:15.957
<i>Bigger diaphragm!</i>

250
00:18:15.958 --> 00:18:17.209
Inhale!

251
00:18:17.709 --> 00:18:19.418
Exhale!

252
00:18:19.419 --> 00:18:21.755
<i>Now, exhale. 
Give me five.</i>

253
00:18:23.131 --> 00:18:24.633
<i>And exhale!</i>

254
00:18:28.512 --> 00:18:31.472
Our premiere night will be…

255
00:18:31.473 --> 00:18:33.058
in Dumaguete!

256
00:18:34.643 --> 00:18:36.978
Cheers!

257
00:18:36.979 --> 00:18:39.647
<i>Dumaguete, here we come!</i>

258
00:18:39.648 --> 00:18:42.568
<i>Eight counts, from there...</i>

259
00:18:43.318 --> 00:18:44.569
You okay?

260
00:18:44.570 --> 00:18:47.738
<i>One, two, three!</i>

261
00:18:47.739 --> 00:18:50.324
<i>Jump! Ha!</i>

262
00:18:50.325 --> 00:18:53.077
<i>Keep wiggling!</i>

263
00:18:53.078 --> 00:18:54.078
<i>Shake it off.</i>

264
00:18:54.079 --> 00:18:55.789
Shake it off, guys!

265
00:18:57.416 --> 00:18:58.542
<i>Cheers!</i>

266
00:19:01.587 --> 00:19:03.129
<i>And flex.</i>

267
00:19:03.130 --> 00:19:04.755
<i>Point!</i>

268
00:19:04.756 --> 00:19:06.048
<i>And flex.</i>

269
00:19:06.049 --> 00:19:07.925
<i>Hands up!</i>

270
00:19:07.926 --> 00:19:10.011
<i>In three counts, reach the floor.</i>

271
00:19:10.012 --> 00:19:13.015
<i>One, two, three, reach it!</i>

272
00:19:13.682 --> 00:19:14.849
<i>Find your core, everybody.</i>

273
00:19:14.850 --> 00:19:15.934
Find your core.

274
00:19:16.935 --> 00:19:17.936
Stretch.

275
00:19:19.563 --> 00:19:20.647
What's going on?

276
00:19:22.065 --> 00:19:23.317
Girl, please.

277
00:19:23.483 --> 00:19:25.402
Don't give me the bull.

278
00:19:25.944 --> 00:19:26.695
Are you pregnant?

279
00:19:26.695 --> 00:19:27.695
What?

280
00:19:28.030 --> 00:19:30.574
We shall look upon the glorious dawn!

281
00:19:30.824 --> 00:19:33.327
We shall look upon the glorious dawn!

282
00:19:33.827 --> 00:19:36.413
We shall look upon the glorious dawn!

283
00:19:38.123 --> 00:19:40.875
There's a big future ahead of me, Jonj.

284
00:19:40.876 --> 00:19:42.335
It shouldn't be this way.

285
00:19:42.336 --> 00:19:43.586
It's not part of the plan.

286
00:19:43.587 --> 00:19:45.171
<i>Does Joey know about this yet?</i>

287
00:19:45.172 --> 00:19:48.132
<i>Oh, he knows that's why
he's not going to Germany?</i>


288
00:19:48.133 --> 00:19:49.800
<i>Noel mentioned it to me.</i>

289
00:19:49.801 --> 00:19:52.053
I thought he wasn't going because

290
00:19:52.054 --> 00:19:54.263
he found out you're pregnant.

291
00:19:54.264 --> 00:19:55.932
Joey doesn't know yet.

292
00:19:55.933 --> 00:19:58.684
Besides, he shouldn't
make decisions like that.


293
00:19:58.685 --> 00:20:02.104
Hang on. It might work
even more in your favor


294
00:20:02.105 --> 00:20:04.440
since you're pregnant, right?

295
00:20:04.441 --> 00:20:05.317
<i>Wait!</i>

296
00:20:05.318 --> 00:20:06.776
We're not even sure yet.

297
00:20:06.777 --> 00:20:08.297
That's why we're doing this, remember?

298
00:20:08.862 --> 00:20:11.114
We shall look upon the glorious dawn!

299
00:20:11.490 --> 00:20:13.867
We shall look upon the glorious dawn!

300
00:20:14.910 --> 00:20:18.537
We shall look upon the glorious dawn!

301
00:20:18.538 --> 00:20:20.414
<i>So what if you're pregnant.</i>

302
00:20:20.415 --> 00:20:22.333
So you'll stop for a year

303
00:20:22.334 --> 00:20:24.043
<i>and you won't perform at the Dumaguete leg.</i>

304
00:20:24.044 --> 00:20:25.836
<i>Fine, I'll fill in for you!</i>

305
00:20:25.837 --> 00:20:26.963
I know all the lines anyway!

306
00:20:26.964 --> 00:20:28.382
I'll be the lead!

307
00:20:28.924 --> 00:20:30.050
Yeah, right.

308
00:20:30.509 --> 00:20:32.802
On a serious note, Chris,

309
00:20:32.803 --> 00:20:35.347
I think Joey's gonna be a good father.

310
00:20:36.932 --> 00:20:38.809
Oh, sh♪t!

311
00:20:40.727 --> 00:20:41.645
Here it is.

312
00:20:41.646 --> 00:20:42.895
Where? Let me see!

313
00:20:42.896 --> 00:20:43.647
Let me see!

314
00:20:43.647 --> 00:20:44.647
Let me see it.

315
00:20:45.732 --> 00:20:47.401
Love, eat up.

316
00:20:54.116 --> 00:20:55.909
Something you want to say?

317
00:21:02.040 --> 00:21:03.124
Oh, sh♪t!

318
00:21:03.125 --> 00:21:05.711
I forgot I have a 9:00 a.m.

319
00:21:06.503 --> 00:21:08.295
I'll go ahead, okay?

320
00:21:08.296 --> 00:21:09.840
I'm sorry. Just eat.

321
00:21:12.259 --> 00:21:13.510
Bye.

322
00:21:20.183 --> 00:21:21.684
<i>That's right, stay on your phone!</i>

323
00:21:21.685 --> 00:21:24.521
We'll finish all this on time if
you just stay on your phone!


324
00:21:25.063 --> 00:21:27.356
Don't you see that
humungous hole over there?


325
00:21:27.357 --> 00:21:28.899
I told you, it's going to sink!

326
00:21:28.900 --> 00:21:31.569
How many times do
I have to tell you?

327
00:21:31.570 --> 00:21:35.114
And you! What did I say? Project!

328
00:21:35.115 --> 00:21:36.033
Yes, <i>Direk.</i>

329
00:21:36.034 --> 00:21:38.701
Yeah, scratch your heads!

330
00:21:38.702 --> 00:21:41.037
You all look sick!

331
00:21:41.038 --> 00:21:42.747
Look at Chris.

332
00:21:42.748 --> 00:21:44.124
Follow her!

333
00:21:44.833 --> 00:21:47.169
Guys, I think something's wrong.

334
00:21:47.878 --> 00:21:50.254
<i>What's happening? 
Are you okay?</i>

335
00:21:50.255 --> 00:21:51.339
<i>We need help!</i>

336
00:21:52.841 --> 00:21:56.887
<i>What's wrong Chris?</i>

337
00:22:01.725 --> 00:22:03.560
<i>Sorry for your loss.</i>

338
00:22:35.634 --> 00:22:37.385
<i>Chris?!</i>

339
00:22:38.095 --> 00:22:39.763
Wake up.

340
00:22:41.890 --> 00:22:44.184
Have some coffee.

341
00:22:54.569 --> 00:22:55.403
Are you okay?

342
00:22:55.404 --> 00:22:57.114
I'm okay. Thank you.

343
00:23:24.224 --> 00:23:25.809
Love.

344
00:23:27.519 --> 00:23:28.770
How are you?

345
00:23:29.729 --> 00:23:30.856
All good.

346
00:24:55.607 --> 00:24:57.192
Chris.

347
00:25:21.758 --> 00:25:24.427
Love!

348
00:25:32.727 --> 00:25:34.229
Love?

349
00:25:39.067 --> 00:25:40.819
Love?

350
00:26:48.219 --> 00:26:51.180
Are you saying it's all my fault?

351
00:26:51.181 --> 00:26:55.977
One thing's for sure:
I didn't do anything wrong!


352
00:26:57.312 --> 00:27:01.232
Jon! Jon!

353
00:27:02.233 --> 00:27:07.113
Jon!

354
00:27:18.708 --> 00:27:20.209
Brilliant!

355
00:27:20.210 --> 00:27:22.961
Brilliant! You show off!

356
00:27:22.962 --> 00:27:24.506
You monster!

357
00:27:25.757 --> 00:27:26.800
Amazing.

358
00:27:27.300 --> 00:27:28.759
That was a good one, Chris.

359
00:27:28.760 --> 00:27:29.885
Not at all.

360
00:27:29.886 --> 00:27:31.178
Alrighty. Take five!

361
00:27:31.179 --> 00:27:32.304
Let's take five.

362
00:27:32.305 --> 00:27:33.305
<i>Direk</i>... Wait.

363
00:27:33.306 --> 00:27:35.642
Great work, Cristina.

364
00:27:36.643 --> 00:27:38.228
How was it?

365
00:27:41.022 --> 00:27:42.565
I think he likes you.

366
00:27:43.650 --> 00:27:46.193
Jed's a hottie,
I know you know it. He likes you.


367
00:27:46.194 --> 00:27:48.278
Oh, please. I'm married to me!

368
00:27:48.279 --> 00:27:50.657
Boring! Don't you get sick of it?
No fingerprints?


369
00:27:51.324 --> 00:27:53.284
- Let me see. Let me see. Where?
- Here it is.


370
00:27:54.077 --> 00:27:54.869
Here it is.

371
00:27:54.870 --> 00:27:56.371
Eww!

372
00:28:01.835 --> 00:28:02.876
Hi, sir Joey!

373
00:28:02.877 --> 00:28:03.711
Good morning.

374
00:28:03.712 --> 00:28:05.921
Did you manage to close the account
with the Austrians?


375
00:28:05.922 --> 00:28:06.714
Yes, sir!

376
00:28:06.715 --> 00:28:07.756
Very good.

377
00:28:07.757 --> 00:28:09.174
Good morning, sir.

378
00:28:09.175 --> 00:28:10.509
Good morning.

379
00:28:10.510 --> 00:28:12.594
My meeting with the Go’s, all set?

380
00:28:12.595 --> 00:28:13.679
Done and done.

381
00:28:13.680 --> 00:28:14.805
Very good!

382
00:28:14.806 --> 00:28:15.931
Anything else?

383
00:28:15.932 --> 00:28:16.932
One more thing.

384
00:28:17.976 --> 00:28:20.310
Welcome back!

385
00:28:20.311 --> 00:28:22.021
And welcome to your matches, too.

386
00:28:22.397 --> 00:28:23.648
Matches. Yeah.

387
00:28:24.149 --> 00:28:26.109
Should I set a dinner date?

388
00:28:26.776 --> 00:28:28.152
I... I don't think so.

389
00:28:28.153 --> 00:28:30.321
I mean, they're all the same.

390
00:28:30.864 --> 00:28:31.905
Boring!

391
00:28:31.906 --> 00:28:33.073
Just try.

392
00:28:33.074 --> 00:28:35.910
You never know, your next match
might end up being your soulmate.


393
00:28:36.911 --> 00:28:38.079
Let's see…

394
00:28:41.833 --> 00:28:43.585
We're a match?

395
00:28:51.009 --> 00:28:53.178
Did I hear it right?

396
00:28:53.636 --> 00:28:56.639
You matched with your secretary
on the dating app?


397
00:28:57.098 --> 00:28:59.516
Yana, I have to do
something about these walls


398
00:28:59.517 --> 00:29:03.395
because the whole floor seem to know
everything that goes on in my office.


399
00:29:03.396 --> 00:29:05.647
I'm surprised you didn't
swipe right on her.


400
00:29:05.648 --> 00:29:07.817
You're not supposed to mix
business with pleasure.


401
00:29:08.234 --> 00:29:10.361
But you know, it's weird that…

402
00:29:10.904 --> 00:29:11.488
We...

403
00:29:11.489 --> 00:29:13.030
We never...

404
00:29:13.031 --> 00:29:14.657
We didn't match.

405
00:29:19.329 --> 00:29:22.790
I'm not the type of person
who uses a dating app.


406
00:29:23.541 --> 00:29:24.541
Hmm?

407
00:29:27.504 --> 00:29:28.922
Welcome back.

408
00:29:30.715 --> 00:29:31.715
Thank you.

409
00:29:56.908 --> 00:29:58.951
You'll definitely love this play.

410
00:29:58.952 --> 00:29:59.619
You think so?

411
00:29:59.620 --> 00:30:05.707
Two college sweethearts who
meet each other periodically


412
00:30:05.708 --> 00:30:07.794
every year. I think.

413
00:30:08.378 --> 00:30:09.378
Something like that!

414
00:30:09.379 --> 00:30:13.216
It's supposed to be modern and minimalist.

415
00:30:13.758 --> 00:30:15.968
And apparently,
it's gotten great reviews!


416
00:30:15.969 --> 00:30:17.803
- Oh, thank you!
- This way please.


417
00:30:17.804 --> 00:30:19.556
Wow! Nice!

418
00:30:26.729 --> 00:30:27.939
<i>They say,</i>

419
00:30:29.065 --> 00:30:33.403
that when you ever get the chance
to dance in the rain,


420
00:30:33.987 --> 00:30:35.738
don't let it pass you by.

421
00:30:36.698 --> 00:30:39.284
Once, I let the rain pass.

422
00:30:40.785 --> 00:30:42.369
I was afraid to walk into it.

423
00:30:42.370 --> 00:30:45.998
<i>I only saw a perilous storm
that would devour me.</i>


424
00:30:45.999 --> 00:30:47.624
I've forgotten how beautiful,

425
00:30:47.625 --> 00:30:51.129
the way it makes all things
bloom and open up to it.


426
00:30:51.671 --> 00:30:55.425
The flowers, my heart.

427
00:31:09.522 --> 00:31:11.441
If I could turn back time,

428
00:31:12.442 --> 00:31:15.570
<i>I would dance in the rain with you.</i>

429
00:31:19.365 --> 00:31:22.035
I'll let you take my hand.

430
00:31:24.912 --> 00:31:28.082
And cherish the moment in every droplet.

431
00:31:28.833 --> 00:31:32.420
With it, the downpour of our love.

432
00:31:34.255 --> 00:31:39.719
Our hearts dancing in an eternal rain.

433
00:31:45.183 --> 00:31:46.559
Thank you.

434
00:31:47.435 --> 00:31:48.935
You're really famous now.

435
00:31:48.936 --> 00:31:50.145
You've got fans now!

436
00:31:50.146 --> 00:31:51.813
Please give it to her.
Thank you.


437
00:31:51.814 --> 00:31:54.107
Phenomenal.
Who knew you were so good at this?


438
00:31:54.108 --> 00:31:55.317
It was okay.

439
00:31:55.318 --> 00:31:56.860
But did you see what I saw?

440
00:31:56.861 --> 00:31:57.944
An apparition.

441
00:31:57.945 --> 00:32:00.031
They're still there! Look!

442
00:32:01.991 --> 00:32:03.409
<i>But here I am.</i>

443
00:32:03.743 --> 00:32:04.952
<i>Standing in the shade.</i>

444
00:32:06.329 --> 00:32:08.539
<i>Holding this love tightly inside my arms.</i>

445
00:32:09.791 --> 00:32:13.503
<i>Pleading the clouds for
the softest of rain.</i>


446
00:32:14.337 --> 00:32:15.797
<i>A sliver of chance,</i>

447
00:32:17.382 --> 00:32:21.010
<i>to let it all pour out again.</i>

448
00:32:22.095 --> 00:32:23.845
Congrats, Chris.

449
00:32:23.846 --> 00:32:25.682
- Well?
- Thanks.


450
00:32:37.568 --> 00:32:38.610
<i>Bridge, wait.</i>

451
00:32:38.611 --> 00:32:40.654
<i>They're still there! Look!</i>

452
00:32:40.655 --> 00:32:42.824
<i>I really don't think it's a good idea.</i>

453
00:32:43.324 --> 00:32:45.450
<i>Just one photo, 
I promise.</i>

454
00:32:45.451 --> 00:32:46.618
<i>Bridge!</i>

455
00:32:46.619 --> 00:32:48.161
<i>It'll be quick!</i>

456
00:32:48.162 --> 00:32:50.205
<i>You guys were really incredible.</i>

457
00:32:50.206 --> 00:32:54.085
<i>I could watch it over and over
and not get tired.</i>


458
00:32:54.252 --> 00:32:55.585
<i>It was beautiful.</i>

459
00:32:55.586 --> 00:32:56.670
<i>Let's go guys!</i>

460
00:32:56.671 --> 00:32:59.756
<i>Look at our photos.</i>

461
00:32:59.757 --> 00:33:01.925
<i>She's so pretty. 
It's unreal.</i>

462
00:33:01.926 --> 00:33:03.511
<i>Look at her.</i>

463
00:33:08.141 --> 00:33:09.350
Hey.

464
00:33:10.017 --> 00:33:11.477
You wanna have dinner?

465
00:33:11.811 --> 00:33:13.688
Hi.

466
00:33:14.313 --> 00:33:17.316
I'm still writing, I'm sorry.

467
00:33:18.693 --> 00:33:19.860
Come on.

468
00:33:19.861 --> 00:33:21.821
Do you wanna be left here alone?

469
00:33:22.613 --> 00:33:24.824
That's exactly what I'm going for.

470
00:33:25.283 --> 00:33:27.743
Anyway, I'll go straight home in a bit.

471
00:33:27.744 --> 00:33:29.620
I'll drive you.

472
00:33:30.204 --> 00:33:33.457
Jed, it's okay. I'm good.

473
00:33:33.458 --> 00:33:34.666
Okay.

474
00:33:34.667 --> 00:33:35.585
All right.

475
00:33:35.586 --> 00:33:37.170
Okay.

476
00:34:03.154 --> 00:34:04.781
Morning!

477
00:34:12.330 --> 00:34:13.830
Like clockwork?

478
00:34:13.831 --> 00:34:15.708
Like clockwork.

479
00:34:23.883 --> 00:34:26.344
Don't bother saving that.
Throw it out.


480
00:34:54.705 --> 00:34:55.872
There he goes again.

481
00:34:55.873 --> 00:34:57.875
Online shopping.

482
00:34:58.668 --> 00:35:00.428
What on earth are you
talking about, Vivian?


483
00:35:00.670 --> 00:35:03.964
Gorgeous, hot, sexy…

484
00:35:03.965 --> 00:35:05.174
Add to cart!

485
00:35:06.884 --> 00:35:08.970
Ugly, boring… delete.

486
00:35:09.470 --> 00:35:12.180
Wow. Coming from you?
Like you're not a hustler yourself.


487
00:35:12.181 --> 00:35:13.473
But sir,

488
00:35:13.474 --> 00:35:17.603
us girls, all we're
looking for is true love.


489
00:35:18.437 --> 00:35:20.147
What about you?
What's your goal?


490
00:35:20.523 --> 00:35:22.066
Nothing. To have fun.

491
00:35:22.191 --> 00:35:23.316
I guess the rumours are true, then.

492
00:35:23.317 --> 00:35:27.904
They say since you broke up
with your ex and you left for Germany,


493
00:35:27.905 --> 00:35:29.740
you turned into an "F" boy.

494
00:35:30.867 --> 00:35:33.035
From soft boy to f♪♪k boy.

495
00:35:35.788 --> 00:35:38.915
Excuse me. Where are you even
coming up with this basis of yours?


496
00:35:38.916 --> 00:35:42.085
In case you forgot, I'm the one
setting up your dates every night.


497
00:35:42.086 --> 00:35:44.838
Oh, right.

498
00:35:44.839 --> 00:35:48.217
What happened to the last one
I set you up with?


499
00:35:48.926 --> 00:35:49.926
Which one?

500
00:35:51.888 --> 00:35:53.722
Okay, yeah, we went out a few times.

501
00:35:53.723 --> 00:35:55.516
But she wasn't feeling it, I think.

502
00:35:59.228 --> 00:36:04.567
But if ma'am Yana's your destiny,
I think I can get on board.


503
00:36:10.114 --> 00:36:12.200
I knew it.

504
00:36:16.329 --> 00:36:19.332
Vivian. Remind me to fire you.

505
00:36:21.626 --> 00:36:25.212
Bro, it's Jonjie's birthday.
Let's drink!


506
00:36:57.662 --> 00:36:58.663
Joey?!

507
00:36:59.455 --> 00:37:00.455
Chris?!

508
00:37:00.873 --> 00:37:02.874
You're back together?!

509
00:37:02.875 --> 00:37:03.542
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

510
00:37:03.543 --> 00:37:04.709
<i>No. Don't say sorry.</i>

511
00:37:04.710 --> 00:37:05.962
<i>It's okay.</i>

512
00:37:06.379 --> 00:37:07.379
Did you miss me?

513
00:37:09.590 --> 00:37:10.800
I don't know why I did that.

514
00:37:11.509 --> 00:37:13.302
And I'm not even drunk yet.

515
00:37:14.136 --> 00:37:16.013
It's... It's very you.

516
00:37:16.347 --> 00:37:17.347
It's very Chris.

517
00:37:18.641 --> 00:37:20.184
What do you mean by that?

518
00:37:20.768 --> 00:37:22.143
Impulsive.

519
00:37:22.144 --> 00:37:23.521
Emotional.

520
00:37:24.188 --> 00:37:25.231
So you.

521
00:37:27.441 --> 00:37:29.777
Yeah, well, three years ago,
it would have been cute.


522
00:37:30.236 --> 00:37:31.696
But now,

523
00:37:32.488 --> 00:37:34.365
it's just a little bit immature.

524
00:37:37.159 --> 00:37:38.869
I think everyone's immature.

525
00:37:40.079 --> 00:37:41.872
You just get better at hiding it.

526
00:37:44.125 --> 00:37:45.125
Yeah.

527
00:37:47.545 --> 00:37:48.545
That's it?

528
00:37:49.255 --> 00:37:51.632
Just because your dad told you
to break up with me?


529
00:37:52.508 --> 00:37:54.135
I already told you this before.

530
00:37:57.096 --> 00:37:58.156
How many drinks have you had?

531
00:37:58.180 --> 00:37:58.848
I'm stressed.

532
00:37:59.140 --> 00:38:01.392
You know how I am with my beer
when I'm stressed.


533
00:38:02.560 --> 00:38:04.728
What we have,
we have for the mean time.


534
00:38:04.729 --> 00:38:06.229
We can't drag this out.

535
00:38:06.230 --> 00:38:09.441
What do you think I am, a♪♪hole?
A computer shop?


536
00:38:09.442 --> 00:38:10.609
Pay per hour?

537
00:38:10.943 --> 00:38:12.485
You had the right idea.

538
00:38:12.486 --> 00:38:14.405
Break up with me. Go on!

539
00:38:16.657 --> 00:38:17.657
Oi!

540
00:38:18.034 --> 00:38:19.410
Carlo.

541
00:38:20.161 --> 00:38:21.161
Carlo!

542
00:38:21.328 --> 00:38:21.871
Hey!

543
00:38:22.204 --> 00:38:23.706
This isn't over!

544
00:38:23.914 --> 00:38:25.114
Where are you going? Hey! Hey!

545
00:38:25.207 --> 00:38:27.501
We're not done talking, Carlo!

546
00:38:27.710 --> 00:38:29.085
Hey! Carlo!

547
00:38:29.086 --> 00:38:30.421
F♪♪k you!

548
00:38:31.088 --> 00:38:32.088
F♪♪k you!

549
00:38:32.423 --> 00:38:34.133
You f♪♪king a♪♪hole!

550
00:38:34.842 --> 00:38:35.842
F♪♪k!

551
00:38:36.010 --> 00:38:37.010
S♪♪t!

552
00:38:41.724 --> 00:38:44.477
Carlo!

553
00:38:44.685 --> 00:38:47.438
I was only joking.

554
00:38:50.900 --> 00:38:53.986
Fantastic timing.

555
00:39:01.952 --> 00:39:02.952
Who are you?

556
00:39:03.579 --> 00:39:04.579
Come up.

557
00:39:18.886 --> 00:39:19.845
You poor thing.

558
00:39:19.845 --> 00:39:20.845
Thank you.

559
00:39:21.889 --> 00:39:23.099
<i>What is up with men, huh?</i>

560
00:39:23.516 --> 00:39:25.559
<i>The second they get what they want,</i>

561
00:39:25.893 --> 00:39:29.020
<i>they simply discard you like…</i>

562
00:39:29.021 --> 00:39:30.356
<i>like trash.</i>

563
00:39:30.523 --> 00:39:31.648
Men are trash.

564
00:39:31.649 --> 00:39:32.649
Do you agree?

565
00:39:33.275 --> 00:39:37.862
I don't think that's true for all men.

566
00:39:37.863 --> 00:39:41.325
You've probably never been hurt before.

567
00:39:42.201 --> 00:39:43.993
<i>Why so you have a Pikachu umbrella?</i>

568
00:39:43.994 --> 00:39:46.038
<i>Is it emasculating to own one?</i>

569
00:39:46.539 --> 00:39:48.373
<i>I don't think so.</i>

570
00:39:48.374 --> 00:39:51.292
<i>Everything is a matter of perspective.</i>

571
00:39:51.293 --> 00:39:53.337
<i>Oh? So you're a life coach?</i>

572
00:39:54.380 --> 00:39:55.965
<i>I'm not a life coach,</i>

573
00:39:56.423 --> 00:39:58.758
<i>but I'm pretty sure you're gonna move on.</i>

574
00:39:58.759 --> 00:40:02.428
Before you act like a damn expert
and give out advice,


575
00:40:02.429 --> 00:40:03.429
who the hell are you?

576
00:40:03.430 --> 00:40:05.141
I don't even know your name.

577
00:40:05.766 --> 00:40:06.766
Ah, right.

578
00:40:08.477 --> 00:40:09.477
Joey.

579
00:40:11.230 --> 00:40:12.230
Christina.

580
00:40:12.773 --> 00:40:13.773
Chris.

581
00:40:26.704 --> 00:40:28.580
You still remember that?

582
00:40:28.581 --> 00:40:30.832
Of course. Don't tell me
you don't remember?


583
00:40:30.833 --> 00:40:31.958
Want me to remind you?

584
00:40:31.959 --> 00:40:32.293
Yeah, how?

585
00:40:32.293 --> 00:40:32.918
I could act it out.

586
00:40:32.918 --> 00:40:33.918
Sure, yes.

587
00:40:34.086 --> 00:40:35.086
Carlo?

588
00:40:35.421 --> 00:40:38.423
Carlo, wait! Please!
Wait for me! This isn't over!


589
00:40:38.424 --> 00:40:39.383
We're not done yet!

590
00:40:39.383 --> 00:40:40.217
Come back!

591
00:40:40.217 --> 00:40:40.634
You know,

592
00:40:40.635 --> 00:40:42.760
You f♪♪king a♪♪hole!

593
00:40:42.761 --> 00:40:46.389
You know, there's a reason
I'm the actor between us.


594
00:40:46.390 --> 00:40:47.724
Why, of course! That's why
I'm a big fan of yours!


595
00:40:47.725 --> 00:40:48.893
Idol!

596
00:40:49.810 --> 00:40:50.810
I like it.

597
00:40:51.187 --> 00:40:52.187
Like what?

598
00:40:53.647 --> 00:40:54.647
My acting?

599
00:40:54.690 --> 00:40:56.275
No, you've loosened up!

600
00:41:03.407 --> 00:41:04.825
Thanks for

601
00:41:07.036 --> 00:41:08.579
…for whatever this is.

602
00:41:09.038 --> 00:41:10.247
Reunion?

603
00:41:11.040 --> 00:41:12.582
Wow, reunion?

604
00:41:12.583 --> 00:41:14.125
Fine. For the kiss, okay?

605
00:41:14.126 --> 00:41:14.919
Thanks for the kiss.

606
00:41:14.919 --> 00:41:15.628
Thank you also.

607
00:41:15.629 --> 00:41:19.380
But I have a 6:00 a.m.
tomorrow in Baguio.


608
00:41:19.381 --> 00:41:21.175
Rehearsals. Super early.

609
00:41:21.759 --> 00:41:23.760
You're an early bird now? 6:00 a.m.?

610
00:41:23.761 --> 00:41:25.762
That used to be your bedtime!

611
00:41:25.763 --> 00:41:31.185
Yep. Well, we grow older,
but not necessarily wiser.


612
00:41:31.685 --> 00:41:32.311
That's life.

613
00:41:32.519 --> 00:41:33.854
Mm. Yeah.

614
00:41:37.608 --> 00:41:39.485
I have a 6:00 a.m.

615
00:41:40.152 --> 00:41:41.153
Okay, nevermind.

616
00:41:42.154 --> 00:41:43.947
- Bro, you all right?
- We're great bro.


617
00:41:43.948 --> 00:41:45.531
Girl!

618
00:41:45.532 --> 00:41:47.618
Happy birthday, girl!

619
00:41:47.952 --> 00:41:49.202
Chris, one for the road.

620
00:41:49.203 --> 00:41:50.495
You mean a photo?

621
00:41:50.496 --> 00:41:52.372
- Of you two.
- Us two?


622
00:41:52.373 --> 00:41:54.541
Come on, let's have a look.

623
00:41:57.002 --> 00:41:58.169
Say "Jonjie!"

624
00:41:58.170 --> 00:41:59.672
Jonjie!

625
00:42:04.009 --> 00:42:05.134
Guys, sorry. I have to go.

626
00:42:05.135 --> 00:42:06.636
My carpool's here.

627
00:42:06.637 --> 00:42:08.347
Jonj, happy birthday.

628
00:42:09.348 --> 00:42:09.932
Bye.

629
00:42:09.933 --> 00:42:11.392
Should I walk you?

630
00:42:12.309 --> 00:42:13.936
I unblocked you.

631
00:42:18.899 --> 00:42:19.899
Friends?

632
00:42:21.235 --> 00:42:21.986
Friends.

633
00:42:22.236 --> 00:42:22.903
Bye.

634
00:42:22.903 --> 00:42:23.903
Take care.

635
00:42:24.613 --> 00:42:26.073
Sleep early.

636
00:42:28.909 --> 00:42:30.452
Hi there!

637
00:42:31.120 --> 00:42:32.453
Ah, hi!

638
00:42:32.454 --> 00:42:33.789
Nice to see you!

639
00:42:34.957 --> 00:42:35.957
<i>Say cheese!</i>

640
00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:38.918
No photos please.

641
00:42:38.919 --> 00:42:39.919
Alright, bro!

642
00:42:40.212 --> 00:42:42.131
Let's drink!

643
00:42:42.423 --> 00:42:43.007
Sure?

644
00:42:43.007 --> 00:42:44.007
Yes.

645
00:42:44.174 --> 00:42:45.342
Aren't you driving?

646
00:42:51.807 --> 00:42:53.767
I can't believe you still have that.

647
00:42:58.939 --> 00:43:00.481
You're still using it.

648
00:43:00.482 --> 00:43:04.111
Irreplaceable like me? Hahaha

649
00:43:08.282 --> 00:43:09.741
Chris!

650
00:43:09.742 --> 00:43:11.826
Did you get to that audition?

651
00:43:11.827 --> 00:43:12.745
What's it to you?

652
00:43:12.746 --> 00:43:14.996
Hmmmm...

653
00:43:14.997 --> 00:43:17.457
A little hot-headed, are we?

654
00:43:17.458 --> 00:43:19.084
Lighten up a bit.

655
00:43:20.419 --> 00:43:23.630
Huh?

656
00:43:30.888 --> 00:43:33.181
I'll pick you up later.

657
00:43:33.182 --> 00:43:37.227
Why? What's up?

658
00:43:40.606 --> 00:43:42.023
Yes!

659
00:43:42.024 --> 00:43:43.442
I've got it.

660
00:43:44.026 --> 00:43:47.320
Okay, uh, sir Don? You're up.

661
00:43:47.321 --> 00:43:48.405
Sorry.

662
00:43:49.239 --> 00:43:50.365
You just got in?

663
00:43:50.366 --> 00:43:50.908
Yes, sir.

664
00:43:50.909 --> 00:43:52.951
Here's your number.
Please wait for your cue.


665
00:43:53.118 --> 00:43:54.161
Go ahead, sir.

666
00:44:00.751 --> 00:44:02.961
See you!

667
00:44:13.680 --> 00:44:15.599
Next one. Christina Roxas.

668
00:44:16.183 --> 00:44:17.225
All right. Okay.

669
00:44:17.226 --> 00:44:18.644
Miss Chris it's your turn.

670
00:44:19.186 --> 00:44:20.187
Good afternoon!

671
00:44:20.896 --> 00:44:21.772
Good afternoon.

672
00:44:21.773 --> 00:44:25.358
If anyone here has any objections

673
00:44:25.359 --> 00:44:27.443
before the wedding,

674
00:44:27.444 --> 00:44:29.071
this is your chance.

675
00:44:32.574 --> 00:44:33.534
I object!

676
00:44:33.535 --> 00:44:35.202
Stop this wedding!

677
00:44:36.620 --> 00:44:38.956
Stop this wedding at once!

678
00:44:40.290 --> 00:44:42.334
Stop this wedding!

679
00:44:45.712 --> 00:44:48.423
In fairness.

680
00:44:48.424 --> 00:44:50.591
Not bad. I'm impressed.

681
00:44:50.592 --> 00:44:52.927
Thank you very much.

682
00:44:52.928 --> 00:44:54.430
<i>However…</i>

683
00:44:56.140 --> 00:44:57.433
<i>Chris wait.</i>

684
00:44:57.975 --> 00:45:01.478
<i>We're really looking for someone…</i>

685
00:45:02.479 --> 00:45:03.647
<i>…relatable.</i>

686
00:45:08.902 --> 00:45:10.028
No pressure.

687
00:45:11.697 --> 00:45:12.697
Kiss me.

688
00:45:13.657 --> 00:45:16.618
But don't you dare
fall in love with me.

689
00:45:18.370 --> 00:45:18.787
So there.

690
00:45:18.788 --> 00:45:20.872
From a noon time show, upscale

691
00:45:20.873 --> 00:45:22.498
and very popular.

692
00:45:22.499 --> 00:45:26.462
We're actually looking
for someone who's a bit more…


693
00:45:27.546 --> 00:45:30.215
…reachable!

694
00:45:31.800 --> 00:45:33.010
Can I borrow this?

695
00:45:33.469 --> 00:45:35.803
Didn't you put that in your mouth?

696
00:45:35.804 --> 00:45:37.096
Give me a sec.

697
00:45:37.097 --> 00:45:40.266
Hello! How's it going you guys?

698
00:45:40.267 --> 00:45:42.059
Hang in there!

699
00:45:42.060 --> 00:45:44.228
Keep going!

700
00:45:44.229 --> 00:45:46.481
Why did it turn into a comedy?

701
00:45:46.482 --> 00:45:48.192
Keep it serious.

702
00:45:48.942 --> 00:45:51.319
You have a pretty face!

703
00:45:51.320 --> 00:45:54.114
Unbelievably so,
but you're still giving mestiza.


704
00:45:54.740 --> 00:45:56.824
All right, I'll give you Morena.

705
00:45:56.825 --> 00:45:58.243
National artist!

706
00:46:03.165 --> 00:46:05.374
There's no...

707
00:46:05.375 --> 00:46:06.543
Chance!

708
00:46:06.877 --> 00:46:08.086
Not a chance!

709
00:46:08.462 --> 00:46:10.130
So can you shut it? Enough!

710
00:46:10.589 --> 00:46:11.589
Okay?

711
00:46:13.967 --> 00:46:15.260
Thank you for your time.

712
00:46:15.844 --> 00:46:17.054
Thank you, sir.

713
00:46:17.888 --> 00:46:20.432
<i>Next! Erwin, bring in the next one.</i>

714
00:46:22.643 --> 00:46:24.937
<i>She's making my blood rise. Jesus.</i>

715
00:46:38.992 --> 00:46:40.785
What?

716
00:46:40.786 --> 00:46:42.663
My Pikachu's gotten bigger.

717
00:47:14.069 --> 00:47:15.152
Your steamed siomai.

718
00:47:15.153 --> 00:47:16.404
Thank you very much.

719
00:47:16.405 --> 00:47:17.322
The sauce.

720
00:47:17.323 --> 00:47:18.739
- Thanks.
- You still remember?


721
00:47:18.740 --> 00:47:19.991
Of course.

722
00:47:19.992 --> 00:47:21.118
It's your favorite.

723
00:47:22.160 --> 00:47:23.996
Okay. Let's see.

724
00:47:24.454 --> 00:47:25.664
- What does it say?
- It says…


725
00:47:25.914 --> 00:47:30.669
"The best things in life are free,
but you can't have it all."


726
00:47:34.047 --> 00:47:35.172
<i>Isn't that weird?</i>

727
00:47:35.173 --> 00:47:37.967
<i>The best things in life are free</i>

728
00:47:37.968 --> 00:47:41.012
but the one thing you desire most

729
00:47:41.013 --> 00:47:42.930
will never be yours.

730
00:47:42.931 --> 00:47:45.475
You could say that "best thing"

731
00:47:46.518 --> 00:47:47.936
was never meant for you.

732
00:47:48.687 --> 00:47:51.480
Or that you've had it once

733
00:47:51.481 --> 00:47:54.442
but you let it slip away.

734
00:47:54.443 --> 00:47:57.863
<i>Or you thought it was the best thing,</i>

735
00:47:58.572 --> 00:48:00.282
<i>turns out he's an a♪♪hole.</i>

736
00:48:01.950 --> 00:48:03.910
You've been attracting a♪♪holes?

737
00:48:05.495 --> 00:48:08.165
I don't know, but I've met a few.

738
00:48:09.124 --> 00:48:10.166
Different exes.

739
00:48:10.167 --> 00:48:11.167
Yes.

740
00:48:11.418 --> 00:48:12.627
Like Mark.

741
00:48:12.628 --> 00:48:14.086
<i>My co-actor.</i>

742
00:48:14.087 --> 00:48:15.671
<i>I thought we would get along</i>

743
00:48:15.672 --> 00:48:17.423
<i>because we had the same passions.</i>

744
00:48:17.424 --> 00:48:20.344
<i>But he suffered from insecurity.</i>

745
00:48:21.345 --> 00:48:22.679
<i>What about you?</i>

746
00:48:23.347 --> 00:48:23.722
Me?

747
00:48:23.930 --> 00:48:24.556
Mm-hm.

748
00:48:24.556 --> 00:48:25.556
Marga.

749
00:48:26.183 --> 00:48:26.725
Marga?

750
00:48:26.726 --> 00:48:27.809
<i>She was perfect.</i>

751
00:48:28.143 --> 00:48:30.312
<i>She wasn't fussy or dramatic,</i>

752
00:48:30.771 --> 00:48:31.771
<i>not clingy.</i>

753
00:48:32.189 --> 00:48:33.440
<i>She knew how to cook,</i>

754
00:48:34.358 --> 00:48:35.441
<i>she's smart.</i>

755
00:48:35.442 --> 00:48:35.943
<i>Wow.</i>

756
00:48:36.109 --> 00:48:37.652
<i>There's just a small problem.</i>

757
00:48:37.653 --> 00:48:38.153
<i>No big deal.</i>

758
00:48:38.153 --> 00:48:39.029
<i>What?</i>

759
00:48:39.030 --> 00:48:41.865
<i>Three-timer. 
With my friends, too.</i>

760
00:48:42.866 --> 00:48:43.492
Three?

761
00:48:43.492 --> 00:48:44.201
Three.

762
00:48:44.202 --> 00:48:45.493
Not, two...

763
00:48:45.494 --> 00:48:47.119
But three?!

764
00:48:47.120 --> 00:48:47.913
Yeah.

765
00:48:47.914 --> 00:48:49.205
Wow.

766
00:48:49.206 --> 00:48:50.499
- That's life.
- Amazing!


767
00:48:53.293 --> 00:48:55.878
<i>Isn't that what you wanted?</i>

768
00:48:55.879 --> 00:48:56.755
<i>Just go on dates,</i>

769
00:48:56.756 --> 00:48:58.048
<i>no commitment.</i>

770
00:49:00.175 --> 00:49:01.718
I thought so, too.

771
00:49:02.886 --> 00:49:04.888
But eventually, 
I realized that

772
00:49:05.263 --> 00:49:08.850
I want a meaningful relationship.

773
00:49:11.603 --> 00:49:14.606
<i>Whereas she just wanted to mess around.</i>

774
00:49:15.190 --> 00:49:19.194
<i>She runs away from her responsibilities.</i>

775
00:49:32.457 --> 00:49:36.920
Man, all we talked about
were our exes all day.


776
00:49:37.713 --> 00:49:39.756
I think we should stop. Move on.

777
00:49:40.006 --> 00:49:42.509
Sounds like a collection of bloopers, huh?

778
00:49:43.218 --> 00:49:46.596
But at the time,
we were pretty banged up.


779
00:49:47.597 --> 00:49:50.100
We were pretty silly.

780
00:49:55.355 --> 00:49:59.443
Do you think it's true
what they say about exes


781
00:50:00.360 --> 00:50:01.903
who stay friends...

782
00:50:03.572 --> 00:50:09.703
That it's either they still love each other

783
00:50:10.454 --> 00:50:11.538
or

784
00:50:16.168 --> 00:50:20.213
they never really loved
each other in the first place.


785
00:50:22.549 --> 00:50:24.217
I think…

786
00:50:27.345 --> 00:50:28.555
You first.

787
00:50:30.432 --> 00:50:31.432
What do you think?

788
00:50:33.101 --> 00:50:34.311
I believe…

789
00:50:39.065 --> 00:50:41.276
I believe there's still love
somewhere there.


790
00:50:43.737 --> 00:50:46.156
Because after a relationship ends,

791
00:50:47.449 --> 00:50:49.117
where does it all go?

792
00:50:50.076 --> 00:50:53.163
All the love that you poured
into one person?


793
00:50:53.580 --> 00:50:55.832
It's not like a faucet

794
00:50:56.208 --> 00:50:58.418
you can turn off when you're done.

795
00:51:06.718 --> 00:51:08.386
Even though it's been so long?

796
00:51:10.722 --> 00:51:13.016
Even though it's still painful.

797
00:51:14.059 --> 00:51:15.727
Do you want to talk about something?

798
00:51:17.813 --> 00:51:20.315
No. Nothing.

799
00:51:21.024 --> 00:51:22.024
Nothing?

800
00:51:25.695 --> 00:51:26.695
Nothing.

801
00:51:28.865 --> 00:51:29.865
Come on, Joey.

802
00:51:31.535 --> 00:51:33.370
Let's talk.
Isn't that what you want?


803
00:51:33.745 --> 00:51:34.746
I said no.

804
00:51:37.916 --> 00:51:38.917
F♪♪k this.

805
00:51:40.961 --> 00:51:43.338
Yes, f♪♪k this!

806
00:51:43.922 --> 00:51:44.922
F♪♪k this!

807
00:51:47.092 --> 00:51:48.635
You want to get mad at me, right?

808
00:51:48.927 --> 00:51:50.387
You want to swear at me?

809
00:51:51.096 --> 00:51:53.849
Go ahead. Let it out.
Blame it on me!


810
00:52:12.659 --> 00:52:14.035
Why?

811
00:52:16.997 --> 00:52:17.997
Why?

812
00:52:19.457 --> 00:52:20.208
Why?

813
00:52:20.209 --> 00:52:21.626
Because I can't!

814
00:52:25.046 --> 00:52:26.756
Because I'm not ready!

815
00:52:29.342 --> 00:52:30.927
Because I'm scared!

816
00:52:32.929 --> 00:52:34.014
I’m scared!

817
00:52:36.683 --> 00:52:38.184
You got scared?

818
00:52:39.227 --> 00:52:40.227
That's it?

819
00:52:40.812 --> 00:52:42.063
What about me?

820
00:52:42.731 --> 00:52:45.316
I had a right to know!

821
00:52:45.317 --> 00:52:47.444
That was my baby, too!

822
00:52:49.654 --> 00:52:52.282
You know I wanted
to have a family, right?

823
00:52:53.700 --> 00:52:57.995
You told me you wanted a complete family
because you came from a broken one.


824
00:52:57.996 --> 00:53:00.122
We were on the way there, Chris!

825
00:53:00.123 --> 00:53:01.416
Why?

826
00:53:04.377 --> 00:53:08.756
Don't I have the right to think about
what I want for my f♪♪king life first?


827
00:53:08.757 --> 00:53:09.507
We're back to what you want.

828
00:53:09.508 --> 00:53:11.008
You're so f♪♪king selfish.

829
00:53:11.009 --> 00:53:13.053
- It's always you!
- I didn't want this.


830
00:53:14.054 --> 00:53:16.556
I didn't want to lose the baby!

831
00:53:19.976 --> 00:53:21.061
It's always you.

832
00:53:21.561 --> 00:53:22.395
It's always about you.

833
00:53:22.396 --> 00:53:24.021
Always... Selfish.

834
00:53:24.022 --> 00:53:25.314
Always? Always about me?

835
00:53:25.315 --> 00:53:27.275
Weren't you leaving for Germany?

836
00:53:28.526 --> 00:53:30.111
You made plans without telling me.

837
00:53:31.029 --> 00:53:31.488
So what is this?

838
00:53:31.489 --> 00:53:32.572
Who's selfish now?

839
00:53:32.822 --> 00:53:35.282
So you didn't tell me for what?

840
00:53:35.283 --> 00:53:36.403
You were getting back at me?

841
00:53:39.079 --> 00:53:40.204
This isn't going anywhere.

842
00:53:40.205 --> 00:53:42.874
There we go!
This is what you do.


843
00:53:43.041 --> 00:53:44.084
Dismissive!

844
00:53:44.834 --> 00:53:47.127
You don't want to have
the hard conversations!


845
00:53:47.128 --> 00:53:49.422
We shouldn't have lived together.

846
00:53:50.507 --> 00:53:53.593
We get this false idea
that we're ready to have a family.


847
00:53:54.928 --> 00:53:56.554
This is not even f♪♪king official.

848
00:54:01.768 --> 00:54:02.769
Yeah.

849
00:54:03.770 --> 00:54:05.939
Yeah, this isn't official.

850
00:54:07.023 --> 00:54:08.191
F♪♪k.

851
00:54:12.612 --> 00:54:15.365
We're not on stage, Chris.

852
00:54:17.534 --> 00:54:19.661
This is real life.

853
00:54:59.743 --> 00:55:03.788
<i>Where is this going?</i>

854
00:55:05.457 --> 00:55:09.502
<i>I'm not sure what's going on</i>

855
00:55:11.212 --> 00:55:16.551
<i>I'm looking for answers</i>

856
00:55:18.636 --> 00:55:19.888
Oops. Joey!

857
00:55:20.013 --> 00:55:21.181
Sorry.

858
00:55:21.848 --> 00:55:23.767
- Easy.
- Thank you.


859
00:55:24.267 --> 00:55:25.267
Let me get that.

860
00:55:28.855 --> 00:55:29.773
Hold on to me.

861
00:55:29.773 --> 00:55:30.773
Lean over.

862
00:55:33.693 --> 00:55:35.987
- Thank you, Chris.
- Hold on to me.


863
00:55:41.159 --> 00:55:42.619
Hang on.

864
00:55:46.539 --> 00:55:49.041
Come on, lie down.

865
00:55:49.042 --> 00:55:50.293
Okay.

866
00:55:53.838 --> 00:55:55.507
- Chris, thank you.
- Okay.


867
00:55:56.299 --> 00:55:57.299
Sorry.

868
00:55:58.802 --> 00:55:59.802
Chris!

869
00:56:06.059 --> 00:56:07.102
Is it stinky?

870
00:56:10.396 --> 00:56:10.855
Joey.

871
00:56:10.856 --> 00:56:11.856
Thank you.

872
00:56:11.857 --> 00:56:12.857
I'm going home.

873
00:56:13.650 --> 00:56:14.150
Huh?

874
00:56:14.317 --> 00:56:15.317
I'll go ahead.

875
00:56:16.111 --> 00:56:16.820
No.

876
00:56:16.820 --> 00:56:17.820
It's all good.

877
00:56:18.154 --> 00:56:18.905
No, wait.

878
00:56:18.906 --> 00:56:20.156
Wait!

879
00:56:20.657 --> 00:56:21.949
I need to go.

880
00:56:21.950 --> 00:56:24.409
Hang on. Wait.

881
00:56:24.410 --> 00:56:25.410
Wait.

882
00:56:27.831 --> 00:56:28.831
Wait.

883
00:56:45.306 --> 00:56:50.937
<i>Your arms wrapped around me</i>

884
00:56:51.646 --> 00:56:57.277
<i>Even if none of this is real anymore</i>

885
00:56:57.402 --> 00:57:03.032
<i>I can understand</i>

886
00:57:03.408 --> 00:57:08.787
<i>if you're fed up,
if you want something else</i>


887
00:57:08.788 --> 00:57:14.419
<i>Don't worry</i>

888
00:57:15.253 --> 00:57:18.131
<i>I'm fine</i>

889
00:57:18.464 --> 00:57:23.511
<i>to wrap your arms around me</i>

890
00:57:24.387 --> 00:57:30.059
<i>Even if none of this is real anymore</i>

891
00:57:30.351 --> 00:57:36.023
<i>I understand,</i>

892
00:57:36.024 --> 00:57:41.528
<i>I know you're fed up,
go where you're happy</i>


893
00:57:41.529 --> 00:57:46.492
<i>Don't worry about me</i>

894
00:57:47.410 --> 00:57:52.373
<i>I'm ready to forget you</i>

895
00:57:54.042 --> 00:57:57.629
<i>I'm fine</i>

896
00:58:00.256 --> 00:58:03.843
<i>I'll be fine</i>

897
00:58:06.262 --> 00:58:09.849
<i>I'll stay right here</i>

898
00:58:11.559 --> 00:58:15.146
<i>I'll be fine</i>

899
01:00:06.507 --> 01:00:07.507
Chris?

900
01:00:08.634 --> 01:00:09.634
Chris?!

901
01:00:11.471 --> 01:00:12.471
Chris!

902
01:00:13.848 --> 01:00:15.308
Chris!

903
01:00:19.145 --> 01:00:20.145
Chris!

904
01:00:20.646 --> 01:00:22.106
Chris! What's wrong?

905
01:00:22.857 --> 01:00:23.983
Chris!

906
01:00:24.484 --> 01:00:25.401
Where are you going?

907
01:00:25.401 --> 01:00:26.401
Home.

908
01:00:27.111 --> 01:00:29.197
Why? Just like that?
What about last night?


909
01:00:30.990 --> 01:00:31.990
Chris!

910
01:00:33.826 --> 01:00:34.826
Last night?

911
01:00:35.328 --> 01:00:36.328
F♪♪k!

912
01:00:37.997 --> 01:00:38.997
Last night?

913
01:00:39.582 --> 01:00:40.124
Yes!

914
01:00:40.124 --> 01:00:41.124
Just s♪x.

915
01:00:41.959 --> 01:00:43.169
F♪♪k.

916
01:00:46.005 --> 01:00:48.049
Tell me what's going on, Chris!

917
01:00:51.219 --> 01:00:52.219
Chris!

918
01:01:20.331 --> 01:01:22.499
Hey, Chris, where are you?
Please. Talk to me.


919
01:01:22.500 --> 01:01:24.710
Let's meet. Where are you?
Let's talk.


920
01:01:28.047 --> 01:01:31.174
Chris Roxas.
Answer me please. Let's talk.


921
01:01:31.175 --> 01:01:37.974
Let's meet at the cafe.
Please talk to me.


922
01:01:41.811 --> 01:01:44.230
I'm begging you.
Please pick up the phone.


923
01:01:49.569 --> 01:01:51.528
Am I an idiot?

924
01:01:51.529 --> 01:01:52.780
Yes.

925
01:01:55.283 --> 01:01:57.200
Really? You know it for a fact?

926
01:01:57.201 --> 01:01:59.412
I just answered your question.

927
01:02:03.207 --> 01:02:04.459
Am I a mistress?

928
01:02:05.835 --> 01:02:08.212
Mm… Well, yes.

929
01:02:08.880 --> 01:02:10.423
And no.

930
01:02:16.137 --> 01:02:20.057
No? And yes?

931
01:02:25.396 --> 01:02:28.774
No, because he didn't tell you.

932
01:02:29.233 --> 01:02:30.233
<i>Yes</i>

933
01:02:30.860 --> 01:02:34.739
because he is committed
to Y and you are his ex.


934
01:02:36.657 --> 01:02:40.870
F♪♪k.

935
01:02:42.747 --> 01:02:44.581
I'm such a s♪♪t.

936
01:02:44.582 --> 01:02:46.542
Hell, yeah. That's why we're friends.

937
01:02:47.251 --> 01:02:50.587
Oh, s♪♪t!

938
01:02:50.588 --> 01:02:53.466
Wrong! Wrong move!

939
01:02:54.717 --> 01:02:59.388
I knew it was a bad idea
from the start. That was it!


940
01:03:00.097 --> 01:03:01.431
What? The s♪x?

941
01:03:01.432 --> 01:03:03.099
Yes!

942
01:03:03.100 --> 01:03:07.647
Then I unblocked him

943
01:03:08.272 --> 01:03:10.815
and we became friends again.

944
01:03:10.816 --> 01:03:12.150
Because it's...

945
01:03:12.151 --> 01:03:15.946
It's supposed to be a closed book.

946
01:03:15.947 --> 01:03:18.907
I should have left it that way.

947
01:03:18.908 --> 01:03:23.495
Then this wouldn't have happened.

948
01:03:23.496 --> 01:03:29.669
Maybe there's a reason
why you guys reconnected.


949
01:03:31.045 --> 01:03:34.215
So we can get back together?

950
01:03:34.382 --> 01:03:36.592
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

951
01:03:37.260 --> 01:03:39.052
The dude's got a girlfriend now.

952
01:03:39.053 --> 01:03:42.597
Or do you want me to push you
just because you're my bestfriend?


953
01:03:42.598 --> 01:03:45.016
<i>Don't be like that?</i>

954
01:03:45.017 --> 01:03:49.813
Why are you sulking?
Is he yours? He's not yours.


955
01:03:49.814 --> 01:03:52.649
You're gonna get jealous?
Get depressed?


956
01:03:52.650 --> 01:03:54.609
You'll lock yourself up in your room,
you won't eat?


957
01:03:54.610 --> 01:03:56.653
Your mom's gonna ask for you
and you won't answer?


958
01:03:56.654 --> 01:03:59.030
Then we'll panic,
and you'll unalive yourself?


959
01:03:59.031 --> 01:04:00.324
Then we'll bury you?

960
01:04:02.785 --> 01:04:06.205
Bury me?
Can't you say a eulogy first?


961
01:04:09.834 --> 01:04:11.251
We're out of budget.

962
01:04:11.252 --> 01:04:13.129
Wake's one day, that's it.

963
01:04:33.441 --> 01:04:34.525
Someone's at the door.

964
01:04:34.942 --> 01:04:36.944
Chris is in here!

965
01:04:37.236 --> 01:04:38.571
<i>Chris, I know you're there.</i>

966
01:04:41.782 --> 01:04:42.782
<i>Chris.</i>

967
01:04:48.789 --> 01:04:50.124
<i>Chris.</i>

968
01:04:50.916 --> 01:04:53.919
What's the matter?
Get out there.


969
01:04:55.504 --> 01:04:56.880
<i>Let's talk, please.</i>

970
01:04:56.881 --> 01:04:58.215
Go, talk to him!

971
01:05:01.844 --> 01:05:04.013
Chris, please.
I know you're there.


972
01:05:04.847 --> 01:05:06.140
<i>But seriously,</i>

973
01:05:07.475 --> 01:05:12.896
have you ever thought about…

974
01:05:12.897 --> 01:05:14.523
What is this all about?

975
01:05:16.484 --> 01:05:17.526
Meaning?

976
01:05:18.069 --> 01:05:23.281
Maybe you like how comfortable
you are around him.


977
01:05:23.282 --> 01:05:24.617
Or you're freeling guilty.

978
01:05:25.201 --> 01:05:29.163
Or maybe you have unfinished
business with each other.


979
01:05:29.789 --> 01:05:32.625
Unfinished business?

980
01:05:33.292 --> 01:05:34.292
Mm-hm.

981
01:05:36.128 --> 01:05:37.128
Like a ghost?

982
01:05:38.214 --> 01:05:40.257
You're not making any sense.

983
01:05:43.636 --> 01:05:45.012
You know what I mean.

984
01:05:46.138 --> 01:05:48.808
You do. Right?

985
01:05:51.811 --> 01:05:55.940
Let's drink. Take a shot... Our shot.

986
01:05:58.192 --> 01:05:59.651
Let's drink some more.

987
01:05:59.652 --> 01:06:03.197
One for the booking!

988
01:06:04.907 --> 01:06:07.535
Chris, please. Let's talk.

989
01:07:05.885 --> 01:07:09.471
Ha-ha-ha
-Ha! Ha! Happy Birthday!

990
01:07:09.472 --> 01:07:15.185
Happy Birthday!

991
01:07:15.186 --> 01:07:18.564
- Happy Birthday!
- Happy bithday, honey!


992
01:07:19.356 --> 01:07:21.400
Blow your candle!

993
01:07:21.984 --> 01:07:23.694
Make a wish!

994
01:07:30.618 --> 01:07:31.785
Thank you, Ma.

995
01:07:31.786 --> 01:07:33.203
- Thank you!
- Of course!


996
01:07:33.204 --> 01:07:34.370
My goodness.

997
01:07:34.371 --> 01:07:37.081
Don't you have school later?

998
01:07:37.082 --> 01:07:38.583
How can I not worry?

999
01:07:38.584 --> 01:07:40.877
You haven't been on social media for days.

1000
01:07:40.878 --> 01:07:43.755
And we all know that without
proof of life online,


1001
01:07:43.756 --> 01:07:45.632
you might as well be dead!

1002
01:07:45.633 --> 01:07:46.633
Yeah.

1003
01:07:47.384 --> 01:07:49.844
Ah! Sis, can I do a livestream?

1004
01:07:49.845 --> 01:07:53.515
I've got followers requesting me
to introduce my family.


1005
01:07:53.516 --> 01:07:54.391
Really now?

1006
01:07:54.392 --> 01:07:56.559
Your sister looks like a wet rag
and you want to film?


1007
01:07:56.560 --> 01:07:57.936
<i>What? You totally don't!</i>

1008
01:07:57.937 --> 01:07:59.522
<i>Never!</i>

1009
01:07:59.730 --> 01:08:02.273
Hey, guys! Welcome to my mini vlog.

1010
01:08:02.274 --> 01:08:04.901
<i>And for today,
we're here at my sister's condo.</i>


1011
01:08:04.902 --> 01:08:05.361
Yeah!

1012
01:08:05.362 --> 01:08:06.778
To do an intervention!

1013
01:08:06.779 --> 01:08:08.988
Because she hasn't left
her room in two weeks!


1014
01:08:08.989 --> 01:08:13.576
- Hey! Why do you have to tell them that?
- Isn't that awful? Sulking in her room for two weeks!


1015
01:08:13.577 --> 01:08:14.953
And it's her birthday, too!

1016
01:08:14.954 --> 01:08:16.538
Oh! By the way,

1017
01:08:16.539 --> 01:08:22.710
I got her this Juicy Lushy bath and foot
scrub so when she gets in the shower later...


1018
01:08:22.711 --> 01:08:24.838
If she gets in the shower,

1019
01:08:24.839 --> 01:08:26.631
she'll be squeaky clean!

1020
01:08:26.632 --> 01:08:28.342
Influencer?

1021
01:08:28.592 --> 01:08:29.927
Hey, guys.

1022
01:08:31.512 --> 01:08:32.638
The script.

1023
01:08:33.514 --> 01:08:35.390
- This is yours.
- I'll help you.


1024
01:08:35.391 --> 01:08:37.726
Here.

1025
01:08:42.189 --> 01:08:44.358
Your girl's going through something.

1026
01:08:44.567 --> 01:08:47.903
But she said she's coming today.

1027
01:08:48.404 --> 01:08:50.406
Let's talk later.

1028
01:09:12.511 --> 01:09:14.930
Facebook official.

1029
01:09:16.599 --> 01:09:20.978
Go be happy then.

1030
01:09:23.105 --> 01:09:24.397
<i>Hi!</i>

1031
01:09:24.398 --> 01:09:26.482
<i>Guys, let's welcome Chris back to the show!</i>

1032
01:09:26.483 --> 01:09:28.693
Welcome back, Chris!

1033
01:09:28.694 --> 01:09:29.777
Hello!

1034
01:09:29.778 --> 01:09:31.362
Give her a script.

1035
01:09:31.363 --> 01:09:32.031
Oh, thanks.

1036
01:09:32.032 --> 01:09:34.283
As I was saying...

1037
01:09:51.300 --> 01:09:54.969
<i>Happy birthday to you!</i>

1038
01:09:54.970 --> 01:09:58.390
Happy birthday to you!

1039
01:10:00.559 --> 01:10:06.314
Happy birthday!

1040
01:10:06.315 --> 01:10:10.902
Happy birthday to you!

1041
01:10:10.903 --> 01:10:12.695
Thank you.

1042
01:10:12.696 --> 01:10:13.656
Thank you, <i>Direk.</i>

1043
01:10:13.657 --> 01:10:14.657
Make a wish.

1044
01:10:14.658 --> 01:10:17.409
A wish?

1045
01:10:20.996 --> 01:10:24.540
Thank you.

1046
01:10:24.541 --> 01:10:26.501
Thank you. Wow!

1047
01:10:26.502 --> 01:10:28.169
Thank you so much.

1048
01:10:28.170 --> 01:10:30.588
Happy birthday!

1049
01:10:30.589 --> 01:10:32.048
Thank you, Jed.

1050
01:10:32.049 --> 01:10:33.592
- You're in a good mood.
- I guess.


1051
01:10:34.885 --> 01:10:35.803
Wait, hang on.

1052
01:10:35.804 --> 01:10:37.512
Can you zip it?

1053
01:10:37.513 --> 01:10:39.973
<i>Easy on the chatter.</i>

1054
01:10:39.974 --> 01:10:41.766
We still have read-through later.

1055
01:10:41.767 --> 01:10:43.435
Save your energy!

1056
01:10:44.478 --> 01:10:45.812
Babe.

1057
01:10:45.813 --> 01:10:47.940
Save your energy babe!

1058
01:10:51.193 --> 01:10:54.321
Rich coming from someone
who flirts on their phone all day.


1059
01:11:14.717 --> 01:11:16.551
What, no way. I'm the true queen.

1060
01:11:16.552 --> 01:11:18.011
Noel and I are
going strong for four years.

1061
01:11:18.012 --> 01:11:21.515
For four years,
he's been pumping me full of love.


1062
01:11:22.141 --> 01:11:23.141
Hey...

1063
01:11:23.559 --> 01:11:26.269
<i>I've got a photo exhibit this Friday.</i>

1064
01:11:26.270 --> 01:11:28.104
You two come, please.

1065
01:11:28.105 --> 01:11:29.273
Please.

1066
01:11:31.817 --> 01:11:33.736
Yes!

1067
01:11:36.071 --> 01:11:37.780
Help yourself.

1068
01:11:37.781 --> 01:11:38.781
Okay.

1069
01:11:45.497 --> 01:11:49.333
Go on, be like that.
You don't want to?


1070
01:11:49.334 --> 01:11:51.670
It's not that I don't want to.

1071
01:11:54.214 --> 01:11:56.799
Chris, support me for once.

1072
01:11:56.800 --> 01:11:59.677
Support your local artist, bestfriend.

1073
01:11:59.678 --> 01:12:02.555
Classic emotional blackmail.

1074
01:12:02.556 --> 01:12:05.016
Hold up, I'm not blackmailing anyone.

1075
01:12:05.017 --> 01:12:06.476
I thought you were fine?

1076
01:12:06.477 --> 01:12:08.394
I thought you've moved on?

1077
01:12:08.395 --> 01:12:10.063
You're even wearing boho today.

1078
01:12:10.064 --> 01:12:13.067
Is it all for show, then?

1079
01:12:14.902 --> 01:12:19.113
I just haven't figured out how to explain
to him everything that's happened.


1080
01:12:19.114 --> 01:12:19.990
How?

1081
01:12:19.991 --> 01:12:21.240
Why do you need to explain?

1082
01:12:21.241 --> 01:12:25.286
You don't need to justify why
after having a very good s♪x,


1083
01:12:25.287 --> 01:12:27.371
you just vanished.

1084
01:12:27.372 --> 01:12:29.749
Maybe you just need
to be there for him

1085
01:12:29.750 --> 01:12:31.834
and show him that you're not into him.

1086
01:12:31.835 --> 01:12:35.255
Show him that you have moved on.

1087
01:12:53.524 --> 01:12:57.402
<i>We were laughing because the whole
conversation... It was so...</i>


1088
01:12:58.487 --> 01:13:00.155
<i>Wait, wait. Sorry.</i>

1089
01:13:00.739 --> 01:13:02.532
But girls, you have to meet Alex.

1090
01:13:02.533 --> 01:13:03.492
Yeah.

1091
01:13:03.493 --> 01:13:06.369
Speaking. Alex!

1092
01:13:06.370 --> 01:13:08.455
Jonj!

1093
01:13:09.790 --> 01:13:10.873
Oh, thank you. Thank you.

1094
01:13:10.874 --> 01:13:12.333
Damn, Alex.

1095
01:13:12.334 --> 01:13:14.001
Your photos are so fantastic.

1096
01:13:14.002 --> 01:13:15.295
So moving.

1097
01:13:15.754 --> 01:13:18.882
Wait, let's take a selfie
before you get famous.


1098
01:13:22.636 --> 01:13:23.678
Love it.

1099
01:13:23.679 --> 01:13:24.304
Finally.

1100
01:13:24.305 --> 01:13:25.638
I believe in your talent.

1101
01:13:25.639 --> 01:13:27.014
I wore a parachute for you today.

1102
01:13:27.015 --> 01:13:27.975
For your exhibit.

1103
01:13:27.976 --> 01:13:31.060
And I made sure
I invited all my friends.


1104
01:13:31.061 --> 01:13:32.061
Yes!

1105
01:13:32.062 --> 01:13:33.146
Who did you say were coming?

1106
01:13:33.147 --> 01:13:34.939
Big people.

1107
01:13:34.940 --> 01:13:36.315
- Alex.
- Oh, hey.


1108
01:13:36.316 --> 01:13:37.483
Congratulations, brother.

1109
01:13:37.484 --> 01:13:38.734
I'm proud of you.

1110
01:13:38.735 --> 01:13:39.986
It's nice to see you.

1111
01:13:39.987 --> 01:13:40.987
- Hello.
- Hi.


1112
01:13:40.988 --> 01:13:42.655
Jonjie.

1113
01:13:42.656 --> 01:13:43.990
Hello.

1114
01:13:43.991 --> 01:13:45.575
You two know each other?

1115
01:13:45.576 --> 01:13:47.493
Yeah.

1116
01:13:47.494 --> 01:13:48.661
We go a long way back.

1117
01:13:48.662 --> 01:13:49.621
Yeah?

1118
01:13:49.622 --> 01:13:51.874
He's the one who invited me here tonight.

1119
01:13:52.457 --> 01:13:54.041
- Hi.
- Hello!


1120
01:13:54.042 --> 01:13:55.543
Babe, let me just get us drinks.

1121
01:13:55.544 --> 01:13:57.671
- Yes, please. Get one for me, too.
- Yes, yes.


1122
01:13:58.964 --> 01:14:00.549
- Jonjie!
- Yes?


1123
01:14:01.425 --> 01:14:02.467
We have a problem?

1124
01:14:02.468 --> 01:14:02.968
What?!

1125
01:14:02.969 --> 01:14:04.302
How you feeling?

1126
01:14:04.303 --> 01:14:05.303
Here's the thing…

1127
01:14:06.346 --> 01:14:10.726
I'm having second thoughts.
I don't know if this is the right time?


1128
01:14:11.059 --> 01:14:12.894
Maybe it's too early.

1129
01:14:12.895 --> 01:14:15.396
Maybe I should wait
for a better time?


1130
01:14:15.397 --> 01:14:18.608
This isn't my night.
It's your night, not mine.


1131
01:14:18.609 --> 01:14:20.526
Is it for them?

1132
01:14:20.527 --> 01:14:22.195
It's for you.

1133
01:14:22.196 --> 01:14:26.240
Besides, everything's in place.
You can't back out now.


1134
01:14:26.241 --> 01:14:27.951
- It's now or never, bro.
- Jonj.


1135
01:14:29.328 --> 01:14:30.579
Oh!

1136
01:14:33.040 --> 01:14:36.125
Here comes the woman who'll
get our show sold out.


1137
01:14:36.126 --> 01:14:37.085
<i>Alex, this is Chris.</i>

1138
01:14:37.086 --> 01:14:38.377
- Hi.
- Oh, thank you.


1139
01:14:38.378 --> 01:14:40.379
Chris, this is Alex.

1140
01:14:40.380 --> 01:14:41.714
That's my bestfriend right there.

1141
01:14:41.715 --> 01:14:43.090
Hi. Nice to meet you.

1142
01:14:43.091 --> 01:14:44.301
- Hi, Chris.
- Hi!


1143
01:14:45.385 --> 01:14:46.428
How are you?

1144
01:14:46.762 --> 01:14:48.055
All good.

1145
01:14:49.640 --> 01:14:50.640
Babe.

1146
01:14:51.308 --> 01:14:52.100
Thank you.

1147
01:14:52.101 --> 01:14:53.392
Chris!

1148
01:14:53.393 --> 01:14:55.186
- Hi!
- How are you?


1149
01:14:55.187 --> 01:14:56.938
Nice to see you!

1150
01:14:56.939 --> 01:14:57.980
Long time, huh?

1151
01:14:57.981 --> 01:15:00.358
- We haven't seen each other in ages!
- I know!


1152
01:15:00.359 --> 01:15:02.235
- You look great!
- Oh, you too.


1153
01:15:02.236 --> 01:15:03.362
Super!

1154
01:15:04.530 --> 01:15:05.572
Cute!

1155
01:15:05.781 --> 01:15:07.908
Hi, guys. I'm Jed.

1156
01:15:09.493 --> 01:15:12.161
By the way, guys. Jed, uh...

1157
01:15:12.162 --> 01:15:13.705
Joey.

1158
01:15:14.539 --> 01:15:15.874
- Yana. Hello.
- Yana.


1159
01:15:17.584 --> 01:15:18.502
Nice meeting you, bro.

1160
01:15:18.503 --> 01:15:20.587
Pleasure's all mine.

1161
01:15:21.421 --> 01:15:22.547
I'll go get a refill.

1162
01:15:22.548 --> 01:15:23.423
Yes!

1163
01:15:23.424 --> 01:15:25.216
It's over there, Chris. The bar.

1164
01:15:25.217 --> 01:15:26.593
Okay. Thanks.

1165
01:15:26.927 --> 01:15:28.095
Excuse me.

1166
01:15:28.553 --> 01:15:32.139
<i>Jed, I have to show you
this masterpiece by Alex.</i>


1167
01:15:32.140 --> 01:15:34.643
<i>Let's look around?</i>

1168
01:15:37.437 --> 01:15:39.690
<i>This is nice.</i>

1169
01:15:40.566 --> 01:15:41.941
<i>This one's from Madrid.</i>

1170
01:15:41.942 --> 01:15:42.942
Babe, wait I'll be right back.

1171
01:15:42.943 --> 01:15:43.902
I'll just go there.

1172
01:15:43.903 --> 01:15:45.653
Oh, go. Enjoy.

1173
01:15:45.654 --> 01:15:46.947
I'll just be here.

1174
01:16:01.169 --> 01:16:02.504
Chris.

1175
01:16:03.422 --> 01:16:04.756
Chris!

1176
01:16:05.590 --> 01:16:07.217
Christina.

1177
01:16:08.051 --> 01:16:09.469
Hey.

1178
01:16:10.762 --> 01:16:12.180
I'm talking to you.

1179
01:16:12.764 --> 01:16:14.223
Christina, talk to me.

1180
01:16:14.224 --> 01:16:15.350
Joey.

1181
01:16:16.268 --> 01:16:18.061
Why are you avoiding me?

1182
01:16:18.312 --> 01:16:19.229
Me?

1183
01:16:19.230 --> 01:16:20.813
Of course not.

1184
01:16:20.814 --> 01:16:23.357
Can you be real
for a second, please?


1185
01:16:23.358 --> 01:16:25.568
Sure, how can I help?

1186
01:16:25.569 --> 01:16:28.739
Oh my... Please!
Can you be real for a second.


1187
01:16:30.282 --> 01:16:31.325
Chris!

1188
01:16:32.409 --> 01:16:33.409
What?

1189
01:16:33.952 --> 01:16:34.952
What happened?

1190
01:16:35.120 --> 01:16:36.120
To what?

1191
01:16:36.163 --> 01:16:38.206
G♪♪♪d♪♪nit, can we stop
going round in circles?


1192
01:16:38.957 --> 01:16:41.317
Why did you disappear on me?
You just stopped talking to me.


1193
01:16:41.501 --> 01:16:42.877
Why are you hiding from me?

1194
01:16:42.878 --> 01:16:45.589
Why, is there a
reason for me to stay?

1195
01:16:45.881 --> 01:16:48.007
What's there to talk about?

1196
01:16:48.008 --> 01:16:50.301
That you're with Yana
while we were having s♪x?


1197
01:16:50.302 --> 01:16:51.677
We were going on dates?

1198
01:16:51.678 --> 01:16:53.430
What am I, your side chick?

1199
01:16:54.556 --> 01:16:55.765
I'm sorry I didn't tell you.

1200
01:16:55.766 --> 01:16:59.018
Then you announced on social media
that you're official.


1201
01:16:59.019 --> 01:17:00.436
What's this for?

1202
01:17:00.437 --> 01:17:02.564
What are we even talking about?

1203
01:17:03.690 --> 01:17:06.359
And don't you dare tell me
that we're just being friends.


1204
01:17:06.360 --> 01:17:07.735
That's bulls♪♪t.

1205
01:17:07.736 --> 01:17:08.903
It meant something.

1206
01:17:08.904 --> 01:17:10.029
At least to me.

1207
01:17:10.030 --> 01:17:11.197
It meant something for me!

1208
01:17:11.198 --> 01:17:13.033
It meant everything to me!

1209
01:17:13.700 --> 01:17:15.326
I missed you, Chris. I love you!

1210
01:17:15.327 --> 01:17:16.912
No! I hate you.

1211
01:17:17.913 --> 01:17:20.414
I hated waiting for you
because I still love you.


1212
01:17:20.415 --> 01:17:22.625
And I still love you, too.
We can still do this.


1213
01:17:22.626 --> 01:17:24.001
- We can fix this.
- Stop it, Joey.


1214
01:17:24.002 --> 01:17:25.962
We tried. It didn't work.

1215
01:17:27.005 --> 01:17:28.090
It didn't.

1216
01:17:30.008 --> 01:17:31.176
We can try.

1217
01:17:33.720 --> 01:17:34.721
Babe?

1218
01:17:35.722 --> 01:17:37.182
Are you okay?

1219
01:17:40.769 --> 01:17:42.354
Yeah, babe.

1220
01:17:43.313 --> 01:17:44.980
Just checking if she's drunk.

1221
01:17:44.981 --> 01:17:45.774
She's fine.

1222
01:17:45.775 --> 01:17:46.983
I'm good.

1223
01:17:47.609 --> 01:17:48.692
Are you okay, Chris?

1224
01:17:48.693 --> 01:17:50.111
Yes! I'm okay.

1225
01:17:50.112 --> 01:17:51.112
Thanks.

1226
01:17:52.322 --> 01:17:54.408
Yeah. Go.

1227
01:17:57.702 --> 01:17:59.246
Sorry, babe.

1228
01:18:11.633 --> 01:18:16.178
Not too long ago,
you were just a pipsqueak.


1229
01:18:16.179 --> 01:18:19.515
But look at you now.
You are a genius and I'm so proud of you!


1230
01:18:19.516 --> 01:18:23.103
Ladies and gentlemen, Alex Romulo!

1231
01:18:25.355 --> 01:18:26.606
Yes!

1232
01:18:30.777 --> 01:18:32.153
<i>Thank you very much.</i>

1233
01:18:32.154 --> 01:18:36.198
But before anything else,
I'd love it if you purchased some photos


1234
01:18:36.199 --> 01:18:39.034
so Jonj and I have something
to take home, yes?


1235
01:18:39.035 --> 01:18:40.537
<i>Right, of course.</i>

1236
01:18:40.912 --> 01:18:46.625
Well, actually, this night is special
for another reason.


1237
01:18:46.626 --> 01:18:50.921
Because long before I made it this far,

1238
01:18:50.922 --> 01:18:54.508
<i>he's been a patron of my work
from the start.</i>


1239
01:18:54.509 --> 01:18:56.385
Ladies and gentlemen,

1240
01:18:56.386 --> 01:18:58.262
my friend,

1241
01:18:58.263 --> 01:19:00.264
my dude, my buddy,

1242
01:19:00.265 --> 01:19:02.017
my brodi,

1243
01:19:02.767 --> 01:19:04.644
Joey Martinez.

1244
01:19:05.395 --> 01:19:10.233
He has a special announcement tonight.

1245
01:19:15.572 --> 01:19:17.991
Uh, good evening everyone.

1246
01:19:18.950 --> 01:19:21.243
As unexpected as this is,

1247
01:19:21.244 --> 01:19:22.453
they also say it...

1248
01:19:22.454 --> 01:19:24.956
Love comes in unexpected ways, right?

1249
01:19:29.628 --> 01:19:31.254
That's why…

1250
01:19:34.090 --> 01:19:37.052
I'm sure you didn't expect this.

1251
01:19:40.847 --> 01:19:42.933
Yana,

1252
01:19:43.350 --> 01:19:46.228
will you be my wife?

1253
01:19:49.022 --> 01:19:51.274
Yes, Joey.

1254
01:19:51.983 --> 01:19:54.152
I will marry you.

1255
01:19:56.154 --> 01:19:57.405
Congrats!

1256
01:20:13.672 --> 01:20:15.089
Alex, what was that?

1257
01:20:15.090 --> 01:20:16.049
That wasn't in the plan.

1258
01:20:16.050 --> 01:20:18.093
What happened?
What was that about?


1259
01:20:18.468 --> 01:20:20.094
My friend made a request.

1260
01:20:20.095 --> 01:20:24.140
Your friend is my friend Chris' ex.

1261
01:20:26.351 --> 01:20:28.979
- I didn't know that.
- Yeah, fine. Just shut it.


1262
01:20:29.646 --> 01:20:32.274
- You should have told me.
- I said shut it, okay?


1263
01:20:36.653 --> 01:20:37.821
Chris.

1264
01:20:39.489 --> 01:20:40.949
You okay?

1265
01:20:51.918 --> 01:20:54.337
You want me, don't you?

1266
01:20:55.964 --> 01:21:00.343
You can have me.
Just for tonight.


1267
01:21:16.276 --> 01:21:18.861
You took everything from me.

1268
01:21:18.862 --> 01:21:21.239
I have nothing left for myself.

1269
01:21:21.906 --> 01:21:24.743
Give me another chance.

1270
01:21:26.119 --> 01:21:28.412
If this is the only
way you can love me,

1271
01:21:28.413 --> 01:21:30.665
I'd rather you didn't at all.

1272
01:21:32.792 --> 01:21:35.587
I would do anything to make you stay.

1273
01:21:37.172 --> 01:21:38.631
Yes, anything.

1274
01:21:38.632 --> 01:21:40.342
Anything but be faithful.

1275
01:21:43.928 --> 01:21:46.890
<i>Wait. Stop! Stop!</i>

1276
01:21:47.265 --> 01:21:49.600
<i>Chris! We've been over this.</i>

1277
01:21:49.601 --> 01:21:52.019
You're not heeding my instructions.
There's no improvement.


1278
01:21:52.020 --> 01:21:52.979
Nothing changed.

1279
01:21:52.980 --> 01:21:54.897
You're doing the same thing over and over.

1280
01:21:54.898 --> 01:21:56.940
You're not in the moment.

1281
01:21:56.941 --> 01:21:58.108
You're not here, actually.

1282
01:21:58.109 --> 01:21:59.736
You're not with us.

1283
01:22:00.612 --> 01:22:02.279
What now?

1284
01:22:02.280 --> 01:22:03.740
Should we waste each other's time?

1285
01:22:04.491 --> 01:22:06.575
You're wasting everybody's time.

1286
01:22:06.576 --> 01:22:09.078
If you don't want to rehearse,
just say so.


1287
01:22:09.079 --> 01:22:11.246
You'd better be here when I come back.

1288
01:22:11.247 --> 01:22:13.249
Take five!

1289
01:22:14.125 --> 01:22:15.877
Take five!

1290
01:22:17.128 --> 01:22:18.546
Jed!

1291
01:22:26.054 --> 01:22:27.054
F♪♪k!

1292
01:22:27.055 --> 01:22:28.473
F♪♪k.

1293
01:22:31.643 --> 01:22:35.021
F♪♪k.

1294
01:22:45.699 --> 01:22:46.866
What's the matter?

1295
01:22:49.035 --> 01:22:50.869
F♪♪k this s♪♪t.

1296
01:22:50.870 --> 01:22:52.622
I think I'm pregnant.

1297
01:22:53.665 --> 01:22:55.208
S♪♪t!

1298
01:22:55.917 --> 01:22:57.502
S♪♪t!

1299
01:22:59.587 --> 01:23:01.464
Is it Joey's?

1300
01:23:07.303 --> 01:23:08.887
Thank you.

1301
01:23:08.888 --> 01:23:10.055
Your mango shake.

1302
01:23:10.056 --> 01:23:11.266
Thank you.

1303
01:23:17.605 --> 01:23:19.107
So…

1304
01:23:21.109 --> 01:23:23.653
I think you should know…

1305
01:23:25.363 --> 01:23:27.240
I'm pregnant.

1306
01:23:29.617 --> 01:23:30.617
F♪♪k.

1307
01:23:31.703 --> 01:23:32.703
F♪♪k.

1308
01:23:34.956 --> 01:23:37.083
I wasn't gonna tell you.

1309
01:23:37.792 --> 01:23:41.295
I don't expect you to take
responsibility for it or anything.


1310
01:23:41.296 --> 01:23:43.839
We're not even together, right?

1311
01:23:43.840 --> 01:23:45.967
I just thought you should know.

1312
01:23:46.342 --> 01:23:47.802
So what now?

1313
01:23:48.845 --> 01:23:50.096
What do you mean?

1314
01:23:52.766 --> 01:23:55.100
I mean, look at me.

1315
01:23:55.101 --> 01:23:57.145
I'm not ready for this.

1316
01:24:10.033 --> 01:24:11.951
Ma'am, the doctor will see you now.

1317
01:24:56.913 --> 01:24:57.955
Hey, honey.

1318
01:24:57.956 --> 01:24:58.998
What brings you here?

1319
01:25:05.463 --> 01:25:07.840
Okay, food is ready!

1320
01:25:07.841 --> 01:25:08.966
Start eating.

1321
01:25:08.967 --> 01:25:10.969
You can have as much as you want.

1322
01:25:12.470 --> 01:25:14.888
Yeah? It's hot and perfect.

1323
01:25:14.889 --> 01:25:15.889
Hey, honey,

1324
01:25:16.391 --> 01:25:17.391
eat up, okay?

1325
01:25:17.392 --> 01:25:20.853
Hot soup with lots of vegetables.

1326
01:25:20.854 --> 01:25:23.231
Go on and eat, honey.

1327
01:25:24.482 --> 01:25:27.110
Ma, can I do this?

1328
01:25:30.780 --> 01:25:31.780
What?

1329
01:25:33.116 --> 01:25:34.242
This.

1330
01:25:34.826 --> 01:25:36.828
Why not?

1331
01:25:37.537 --> 01:25:38.830
You can do it.

1332
01:25:40.331 --> 01:25:41.623
Please, it's you!

1333
01:25:41.624 --> 01:25:43.501
Whose daughter are you now?

1334
01:25:45.628 --> 01:25:46.838
Yours.

1335
01:25:47.797 --> 01:25:49.716
Then there's your answer.

1336
01:25:51.259 --> 01:25:53.636
But honey, I know how you're feeling.

1337
01:25:54.095 --> 01:25:56.306
Because I went through the same thing.

1338
01:25:57.056 --> 01:25:59.267
But look at the both of you.

1339
01:25:59.934 --> 01:26:03.271
I managed to raise you.

1340
01:26:03.813 --> 01:26:08.359
We can survive with or without
a man in our household.


1341
01:26:15.491 --> 01:26:17.619
I'm scared, Ma.

1342
01:26:20.455 --> 01:26:22.832
Don't be scared, honey.

1343
01:26:23.708 --> 01:26:26.794
Look, you have me and your sister.

1344
01:26:27.503 --> 01:26:29.172
You can do this.

1345
01:26:29.464 --> 01:26:30.256
Okay?

1346
01:26:30.257 --> 01:26:32.300
You know, sis, 
I look up to you.

1347
01:26:33.426 --> 01:26:35.260
Because you're badass.

1348
01:26:35.261 --> 01:26:36.887
You know what you want.

1349
01:26:36.888 --> 01:26:38.889
You're above the trends.

1350
01:26:38.890 --> 01:26:42.643
Even though I know things do get
difficult for you sometimes,


1351
01:26:42.644 --> 01:26:45.270
you never let it show.

1352
01:26:45.271 --> 01:26:47.690
You sister is right.

1353
01:26:48.816 --> 01:26:50.151
You know,

1354
01:26:52.278 --> 01:26:54.863
when your father and I separated,

1355
01:26:54.864 --> 01:26:56.990
can you believe what
he wanted from me?


1356
01:26:56.991 --> 01:26:58.910
To leave you with him!

1357
01:26:59.243 --> 01:27:02.454
Saying things like I couldn't
possibly raise you


1358
01:27:02.455 --> 01:27:04.749
while I was struggling
as a theater actress.


1359
01:27:08.878 --> 01:27:11.214
But of course, 
I stood my ground.

1360
01:27:12.090 --> 01:27:14.050
I gave birth to you.

1361
01:27:14.884 --> 01:27:18.429
I told myself that I can do it.

1362
01:27:19.764 --> 01:27:23.767
I will raise my daughters on my own.

1363
01:27:23.768 --> 01:27:26.479
And I'll raise them to be good people.

1364
01:27:29.899 --> 01:27:31.609
I think I succeeded, didn't I?

1365
01:27:32.485 --> 01:27:36.029
Jeez, Ma! Why are you making us cry?

1366
01:27:36.030 --> 01:27:39.575
But I agree, but
because not only that, Ma.

1367
01:27:40.284 --> 01:27:43.036
We're nice, and pretty!

1368
01:27:43.037 --> 01:27:44.622
Why, of course!

1369
01:27:45.248 --> 01:27:48.000
Hey, you. You'd better not be
like your idiotic sister.


1370
01:27:48.001 --> 01:27:49.001
Don't...

1371
01:27:49.544 --> 01:27:53.131
You know, sis, whatever you do,
I stan you no matter what.


1372
01:28:03.933 --> 01:28:06.269
<i>It's gonna be okay, all right?</i>

1373
01:28:06.561 --> 01:28:08.730
<i>Dig in. It's your favorite dish.</i>

1374
01:28:09.355 --> 01:28:10.439
Have some adobo, sweetie.

1375
01:28:10.440 --> 01:28:11.566
Yes, Ma.

1376
01:28:15.278 --> 01:28:16.612
Enjoy, guys.

1377
01:28:17.613 --> 01:28:20.158
Jonjie. Thanks for coming.

1378
01:28:21.617 --> 01:28:23.286
Where's Chris?

1379
01:28:23.745 --> 01:28:26.247
Well, she's on break.

1380
01:28:27.874 --> 01:28:29.541
I think I broke her heart.

1381
01:28:29.542 --> 01:28:31.168
Oh, did you? No way!

1382
01:28:31.169 --> 01:28:32.461
She didn't mind at all.

1383
01:28:32.462 --> 01:28:34.964
She hurried home to check on the stove!

1384
01:28:36.299 --> 01:28:38.467
Joey, are you for real?

1385
01:28:38.468 --> 01:28:40.093
Who wouldn't get hurt by what you did?

1386
01:28:40.094 --> 01:28:41.344
Even I was surprised.

1387
01:28:41.345 --> 01:28:43.346
Which by the way,
I haven’t forgiven you yet.


1388
01:28:43.347 --> 01:28:44.807
I'm sorry.

1389
01:28:45.725 --> 01:28:48.603
You know, I did tell Alex
I was having second thoughts.


1390
01:28:49.771 --> 01:28:51.147
Didn't he tell you?

1391
01:28:51.397 --> 01:28:52.606
Listen, Joey.

1392
01:28:52.607 --> 01:28:54.900
It’s not me who needs your apology.

1393
01:28:54.901 --> 01:28:56.569
Apologize to Chris.

1394
01:28:56.694 --> 01:28:57.694
I know.

1395
01:29:00.865 --> 01:29:01.657
How is she?

1396
01:29:01.658 --> 01:29:03.117
She's pregnant!

1397
01:29:05.036 --> 01:29:06.036
Huh?

1398
01:29:08.831 --> 01:29:09.915
How?

1399
01:29:09.916 --> 01:29:12.085
She had s♪x, what else!

1400
01:29:17.173 --> 01:29:20.759
Isn't this great, honey?
We get to hang out again.


1401
01:29:20.760 --> 01:29:22.677
I know.

1402
01:29:22.678 --> 01:29:24.471
It feels nice to have company.

1403
01:29:24.472 --> 01:29:25.640
<i>Isn't it?</i>

1404
01:29:26.099 --> 01:29:27.474
I'll bring these upstairs.

1405
01:29:27.475 --> 01:29:28.101
Okay, Ma.

1406
01:29:28.101 --> 01:29:29.018
Will you be okay down here?

1407
01:29:29.019 --> 01:29:30.310
Yes, I'll just be here.

1408
01:29:30.311 --> 01:29:31.854
All right then.

1409
01:29:48.704 --> 01:29:50.080
You don't need to know.

1410
01:29:50.081 --> 01:29:52.125
<i>Since when did you find out?</i>

1411
01:29:59.674 --> 01:30:01.467
Three months.

1412
01:30:05.680 --> 01:30:07.013
Why didn't you tell me?

1413
01:30:07.014 --> 01:30:08.598
Why would I tell you?

1414
01:30:08.599 --> 01:30:10.351
Not this again.

1415
01:30:10.601 --> 01:30:12.395
It's my child, too.

1416
01:30:16.149 --> 01:30:18.192
It's Jed's.

1417
01:30:20.278 --> 01:30:21.278
Are you sure?

1418
01:30:21.279 --> 01:30:24.156
I'm sure. I know my cycle.

1419
01:30:24.157 --> 01:30:26.117
You're sure or you're denying it?

1420
01:30:26.826 --> 01:30:28.578
Joey, stop that.

1421
01:30:28.911 --> 01:30:31.163
<i>This isn't yours.</i>

1422
01:30:31.164 --> 01:30:34.208
Fine, if it's Jed's, where is he?

1423
01:30:35.042 --> 01:30:36.293
Where is he? Why isn't he here?

1424
01:30:36.294 --> 01:30:38.003
We have different priorities and it's okay.

1425
01:30:38.004 --> 01:30:39.421
Then let me be the father!

1426
01:30:39.422 --> 01:30:40.839
Do you hear yourself?

1427
01:30:40.840 --> 01:30:42.674
I'll take responsibility for you, Chris.

1428
01:30:42.675 --> 01:30:44.467
Stop being ridiculous!

1429
01:30:44.468 --> 01:30:45.178
Chris!

1430
01:30:45.179 --> 01:30:46.220
What?!

1431
01:30:48.014 --> 01:30:50.641
I'd do anything to have you back.

1432
01:30:53.352 --> 01:30:54.854
It's always been you.

1433
01:30:54.979 --> 01:30:57.314
When we first met,
when we fell in love,


1434
01:30:57.315 --> 01:30:59.441
when we broke up,
when we saw each other again,


1435
01:30:59.442 --> 01:31:03.154
even though Yana was there,
it's always still been you.


1436
01:31:04.155 --> 01:31:05.780
You're the one who keeps slipping away.

1437
01:31:05.781 --> 01:31:07.742
I wasn't trying to slip away.

1438
01:31:09.410 --> 01:31:10.410
Then what?

1439
01:31:11.204 --> 01:31:12.663
I'm pulling away.

1440
01:31:17.001 --> 01:31:18.919
Is it because you feel guilty
for what happened between us?


1441
01:31:18.920 --> 01:31:20.378
This. This is why.

1442
01:31:20.379 --> 01:31:22.798
This is why I left.

1443
01:31:24.717 --> 01:31:26.468
You make things difficult for me.

1444
01:31:26.469 --> 01:31:28.471
Difficult?

1445
01:31:30.223 --> 01:31:35.978
I have been dying an entire
lifetime without you, Chris.


1446
01:31:36.354 --> 01:31:38.898
Every meaningless affair...

1447
01:31:40.483 --> 01:31:44.694
And for what? I feel like I'm just slipping
further and further away from you.


1448
01:31:44.695 --> 01:31:46.948
I didn't feel anything until finally...

1449
01:31:48.324 --> 01:31:50.159
Yana came along.

1450
01:31:54.413 --> 01:31:57.250
If that's the case then you
should be with Yana.


1451
01:31:57.917 --> 01:32:02.170
We're damaged, Joey.
We're so toxic towards each other.


1452
01:32:02.171 --> 01:32:05.049
No, no…

1453
01:32:06.092 --> 01:32:09.302
Just say the word, Chris.

1454
01:32:09.303 --> 01:32:10.471
And I'll choose you.

1455
01:32:12.890 --> 01:32:14.766
Any day, everyday I'll choose you.

1456
01:32:14.767 --> 01:32:16.142
That's the difference between you and Yana.

1457
01:32:16.143 --> 01:32:17.602
It's too late, Joey!

1458
01:32:17.603 --> 01:32:19.063
G♪♪d♪mnit, Chris!

1459
01:32:20.564 --> 01:32:22.191
Listen to me!

1460
01:32:23.276 --> 01:32:25.277
Choose me for once.
Choose us this time.


1461
01:32:25.278 --> 01:32:26.529
When will you fight for us?

1462
01:32:29.573 --> 01:32:30.657
When will you finally face this?

1463
01:32:30.658 --> 01:32:31.867
I want to.

1464
01:32:33.577 --> 01:32:35.329
There's nothing that I want more

1465
01:32:36.998 --> 01:32:38.999
than to be with you, to embrace you,

1466
01:32:39.000 --> 01:32:40.835
to wake up next to you.

1467
01:32:43.379 --> 01:32:45.381
But loving you is exhausting!

1468
01:32:49.218 --> 01:32:51.304
I get tired, too, Chris.

1469
01:32:52.763 --> 01:32:54.640
I get tired, too.

1470
01:32:55.516 --> 01:32:57.435
But I never give up.

1471
01:32:59.270 --> 01:33:00.646
I won't give up.

1472
01:33:03.774 --> 01:33:05.151
You have Yana.

1473
01:33:08.112 --> 01:33:09.405
She's good for you.

1474
01:33:11.574 --> 01:33:13.366
Just don’t let her go.

1475
01:33:13.367 --> 01:33:15.745
Just choose her.

1476
01:33:16.537 --> 01:33:17.537
No…

1477
01:33:21.459 --> 01:33:22.710
I love you.

1478
01:33:25.171 --> 01:33:27.256
You're the one I love.

1479
01:33:33.929 --> 01:33:34.929
Chris.

1480
01:33:38.267 --> 01:33:41.437
I love you, too, Joey.

1481
01:33:44.231 --> 01:33:47.234
But it's too painful being with you.

1482
01:33:49.737 --> 01:33:52.072
It's so painful

1483
01:33:52.073 --> 01:33:55.284
to be with you.

1484
01:34:05.878 --> 01:34:11.967
I can't.

1485
01:34:36.951 --> 01:34:38.201
<i>Hija.</i>

1486
01:34:38.202 --> 01:34:40.496
Hi, auntie.

1487
01:34:41.372 --> 01:34:43.289
I'm so proud of you and Joey.

1488
01:34:43.290 --> 01:34:47.961
Even when you were kids, I already
envisioned you as my daughter-in-law.


1489
01:34:47.962 --> 01:34:49.379
Thank you, Auntie.

1490
01:34:49.380 --> 01:34:51.882
But how's Joey?

1491
01:34:55.553 --> 01:34:57.303
I'm sure he's just tired.

1492
01:34:57.304 --> 01:34:58.472
Overwhelmed by all this.

1493
01:35:00.724 --> 01:35:05.563
Greg's mother used to tell me that
I'm the kind of woman that men settle for.


1494
01:35:06.313 --> 01:35:09.232
When the excitement is gone
from the outside,


1495
01:35:09.233 --> 01:35:12.402
<i>he comes home to me for comfort,</i>

1496
01:35:12.403 --> 01:35:15.072
<i>for love, for wisdom.</i>

1497
01:35:15.740 --> 01:35:17.782
I used to resent it.

1498
01:35:17.783 --> 01:35:21.912
Because I know in my heart that
I'm exciting, fun, and unpredictable.


1499
01:35:23.289 --> 01:35:26.875
But as I grew older, I realized

1500
01:35:26.876 --> 01:35:31.964
how blessed I am to have
been that kind of woman.


1501
01:35:33.174 --> 01:35:39.138
Men settle for women who
make them feel safe and secure.


1502
01:35:40.890 --> 01:35:46.270
Don't worry, Auntie. I know Joey
knows better than to screw this up.


1503
01:35:50.399 --> 01:35:51.439
I appreciate this so much.

1504
01:36:21.847 --> 01:36:22.931
Hello?

1505
01:36:22.932 --> 01:36:25.100
<i>Girl, where you at?</i>

1506
01:36:26.602 --> 01:36:32.899
Girl, I'm at home. But later I have
a meeting with some producers.


1507
01:36:32.900 --> 01:36:33.900
Why?

1508
01:36:33.901 --> 01:36:37.654
<i>You don't need me today, right?
You're busy. You've got a lot going on.</i>


1509
01:36:37.655 --> 01:36:40.615
You are a strong, independent,
courageous woman.


1510
01:36:40.616 --> 01:36:44.745
If I needed you I would have
had your schedule blocked off.


1511
01:36:49.959 --> 01:36:51.418
Wait.

1512
01:36:52.836 --> 01:36:54.046
Is it today?

1513
01:36:54.588 --> 01:36:56.882
Mm-hm, girl. It's today.

1514
01:36:58.092 --> 01:37:00.678
S♪♪t!

1515
01:37:02.221 --> 01:37:03.846
F♪♪k!

1516
01:37:03.847 --> 01:37:06.724
F♪♪k! Do you know
I planned for this day?

1517
01:37:06.725 --> 01:37:11.229
I wondered if I should
glam up, stuff my face,


1518
01:37:11.230 --> 01:37:13.232
go on a date…

1519
01:37:15.234 --> 01:37:19.530
F♪♪k! But I'm at home working?

1520
01:37:20.364 --> 01:37:21.823
I don't even feel a thing.

1521
01:37:21.824 --> 01:37:23.491
What?

1522
01:37:23.492 --> 01:37:25.201
Are you for real?

1523
01:37:25.202 --> 01:37:28.746
<i>It's fine, you can be honest. It's just
you and me, no one's watching.</i>


1524
01:37:28.747 --> 01:37:30.873
Tell me, want me to blow up the venue
and stop the wedding?


1525
01:37:30.874 --> 01:37:33.459
<i>Then we'll laugh our heads off
while it burns.</i>


1526
01:37:33.460 --> 01:37:34.460
Would you like that?

1527
01:37:35.546 --> 01:37:36.921
Don't be silly.

1528
01:37:36.922 --> 01:37:39.382
<i>No, I'm serious.
Just say the word.</i>


1529
01:37:39.383 --> 01:37:41.009
<i>I got some friends down here.
What's the plan?</i>


1530
01:37:41.010 --> 01:37:41.760
Chill out.

1531
01:37:41.761 --> 01:37:44.220
I'm just stirring it.

1532
01:37:44.221 --> 01:37:47.140
I know you have a flair
for the dramatic but the whole


1533
01:37:47.141 --> 01:37:50.685
"Stop the wedding!" gig is overdone.
Oh my god, so cheap. You don't like that.


1534
01:37:50.686 --> 01:37:52.520
<i>Just stay fabulous, gorgeous,</i>

1535
01:37:52.521 --> 01:37:54.731
then post a thirst trap on IG.

1536
01:37:54.732 --> 01:37:56.816
"It's your loss, 
Joey Martinez."

1537
01:37:56.817 --> 01:37:58.652
Can I get an amen up in here?

1538
01:37:59.862 --> 01:38:02.238
<i>Christina?</i>

1539
01:38:02.239 --> 01:38:04.032
Hello, girl?

1540
01:38:04.033 --> 01:38:05.075
Girl?

1541
01:38:06.118 --> 01:38:07.536
<i>Christina. Girl!</i>

1542
01:38:08.287 --> 01:38:10.830
Hey, what are you doing here?

1543
01:38:10.831 --> 01:38:12.832
You can't be here.

1544
01:38:12.833 --> 01:38:16.295
Why? 'Cause it will jinx the wedding?

1545
01:38:19.673 --> 01:38:22.134
Are you just settling with me?

1546
01:38:27.848 --> 01:38:29.975
Forget I asked.

1547
01:38:33.604 --> 01:38:35.648
But know this, Joey.

1548
01:38:36.357 --> 01:38:38.192
If you choose me,

1549
01:38:39.735 --> 01:38:42.071
you're not just settling with me.

1550
01:38:45.908 --> 01:38:49.203
Because, Joey, 
I'm the right choice.

1551
01:38:50.162 --> 01:38:52.539
I know you can't love me
the way you love her.


1552
01:38:54.208 --> 01:38:58.087
Hell, I can't even get close.

1553
01:39:00.881 --> 01:39:03.341
But I will wait, Joey.

1554
01:39:03.342 --> 01:39:08.972
Even though I know being with me
won't erase her from your mind.


1555
01:39:13.769 --> 01:39:15.771
I will wait for you.

1556
01:39:18.190 --> 01:39:21.235
I will be with
you until you move on.

1557
01:39:46.301 --> 01:39:50.596
<i>Should we bring these in?</i>

1558
01:39:50.597 --> 01:39:52.307
<i>Go.</i>

1559
01:39:53.559 --> 01:39:55.727
<i>Wait, did you get the right one?</i>

1560
01:39:55.728 --> 01:39:57.521
<i>All right, bring them in.</i>

1561
01:39:58.272 --> 01:40:00.733
<i>Unload the flowers, please.</i>

1562
01:40:04.611 --> 01:40:06.237
<i>Are we missing anything else?</i>

1563
01:40:06.238 --> 01:40:08.614
Unload and bring everything in.

1564
01:40:08.615 --> 01:40:10.199
Double time, please.

1565
01:40:10.200 --> 01:40:11.534
Mister!

1566
01:40:11.535 --> 01:40:14.537
Is this the Martinez
and Santillan nuptials?


1567
01:40:14.538 --> 01:40:16.914
No, ma'am. They're over at South Gardens.

1568
01:40:16.915 --> 01:40:17.875
Bring those in.

1569
01:40:17.876 --> 01:40:19.459
Are you sure?

1570
01:40:19.460 --> 01:40:20.210
Yes.

1571
01:40:20.211 --> 01:40:21.670
Thanks.

1572
01:40:22.296 --> 01:40:24.256
Hurry up. Double time.

1573
01:40:26.300 --> 01:40:28.050
Sir, let's try the chair.

1574
01:40:28.051 --> 01:40:30.137
Sit down? Okay.

1575
01:40:31.638 --> 01:40:32.723
Okay.

1576
01:40:42.107 --> 01:40:44.025
Ah, five minutes.

1577
01:40:44.026 --> 01:40:45.693
I just need to take a break.

1578
01:40:45.694 --> 01:40:46.361
Bro, could you hold it for me?

1579
01:40:46.361 --> 01:40:47.361
Yeah, I'm fine. I'm fine.

1580
01:40:48.197 --> 01:40:50.823
I just need to breathe.
Is that okay?


1581
01:40:50.824 --> 01:40:53.035
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm good. Just need to breathe.


1582
01:41:36.495 --> 01:41:37.830
Move.

1583
01:41:52.469 --> 01:41:53.720
Joey!

1584
01:41:53.971 --> 01:41:54.930
<i>Chris!</i>

1585
01:41:54.930 --> 01:41:55.848
Joey!

1586
01:41:55.849 --> 01:41:57.890
<i>What are you doing here?</i>

1587
01:41:57.891 --> 01:41:58.433
Is it over?

1588
01:41:58.434 --> 01:41:59.601
Is it done?

1589
01:42:01.019 --> 01:42:03.480
Oh, okay. Good. Good.

1590
01:42:04.189 --> 01:42:05.774
Why 'good'?

1591
01:42:06.441 --> 01:42:07.401
Did you come to stop the wedding?

1592
01:42:07.401 --> 01:42:08.401
Yes.

1593
01:42:08.610 --> 01:42:10.237
No! I mean no.

1594
01:42:11.572 --> 01:42:13.490
I can't let the wedding happen

1595
01:42:15.576 --> 01:42:17.870
before we've had this talk.

1596
01:42:21.123 --> 01:42:22.165
Okay…

1597
01:42:25.335 --> 01:42:27.754
I guess I came here for closure.

1598
01:42:30.299 --> 01:42:31.841
Go ahead.

1599
01:42:31.842 --> 01:42:34.386
I want you to go through the wedding…

1600
01:42:34.845 --> 01:42:36.805
with only Yana on your mind.

1601
01:42:39.057 --> 01:42:41.435
Even though I know

1602
01:42:43.979 --> 01:42:46.690
I'm still the one in there.

1603
01:42:54.072 --> 01:42:57.618
I came to say goodbye.

1604
01:43:02.915 --> 01:43:04.415
But I love you, Chris.

1605
01:43:04.416 --> 01:43:07.920
I love you, too. Joey, I do.

1606
01:43:08.629 --> 01:43:11.589
Then let's risk it. F♪♪k it.

1607
01:43:11.590 --> 01:43:13.674
- Let's leave! Let's get away from here.
- That's enough, Joey. Stop.


1608
01:43:13.675 --> 01:43:15.761
We tried. We both did.

1609
01:43:16.803 --> 01:43:19.765
We're not meant to be together.

1610
01:43:20.182 --> 01:43:20.849
Chris…

1611
01:43:20.850 --> 01:43:23.143
We're not meant for each other, Joey.

1612
01:43:24.895 --> 01:43:27.105
I know you don't see it now, but

1613
01:43:27.981 --> 01:43:32.194
I know, and I hope
one day you will realize

1614
01:43:35.197 --> 01:43:36.823
That it's Yana.

1615
01:43:39.201 --> 01:43:40.409
Yana's the one for you.

1616
01:43:40.410 --> 01:43:42.244
Enough about Yana.
What about you?


1617
01:43:42.245 --> 01:43:43.829
- What of you?
- I'll be fine, Joey.


1618
01:43:43.830 --> 01:43:44.998
I'll be fine.

1619
01:43:46.249 --> 01:43:50.295
Trust me, I've been battling with myself
whether or not to come here.


1620
01:43:51.171 --> 01:43:52.797
And...

1621
01:43:52.798 --> 01:43:56.176
it's easy to just
slip out of your life.

1622
01:43:57.886 --> 01:44:00.055
But I'm here.

1623
01:44:02.975 --> 01:44:05.686
I'm here because we loved each other.

1624
01:44:07.896 --> 01:44:13.402
I used to be somebody
who loved all parts of you.


1625
01:44:14.403 --> 01:44:15.403
All of you.

1626
01:44:17.072 --> 01:44:21.200
So I want to propose something.

1627
01:44:21.201 --> 01:44:22.953
Okay.

1628
01:44:35.132 --> 01:44:36.132
What are you doing?

1629
01:44:36.842 --> 01:44:38.343
Joey Martinez,

1630
01:44:40.262 --> 01:44:41.596
will you…

1631
01:44:44.933 --> 01:44:47.060
Will you be my ex?

1632
01:44:52.149 --> 01:44:53.942
Get up.

1633
01:44:56.111 --> 01:44:58.780
Christina Roxas…

1634
01:45:01.241 --> 01:45:03.201
Yes,

1635
01:45:05.954 --> 01:45:08.123
yes, I will be your ex.

1636
01:45:28.602 --> 01:45:29.643
Okay.

1637
01:45:29.644 --> 01:45:30.979
Go.
