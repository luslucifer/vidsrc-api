Of course! It ll be great fun.

25
00:02:41.359 --> 00:02:44.405
Are you walking from the
bus station with the others?


26
00:02:44.449 --> 00:02:47.191
Umm. I guess. Why?

27
00:02:47.234 --> 00:02:49.932
- Flat battery.
- Oh, okay.


28
00:02:49.976 --> 00:02:51.586

the fetish and sport themes.

32
00:02:58.419 --> 00:03:00.813
Well, there s a mixture
you don t hear every day.


33
00:03:00.856 --> 00:03:03.076
I'm being paid well
for the sports stuff.


34
00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:04.643
And the fetish?

35
00:03:04.686 --> 00:03:07.341

00:03:18.787 --> 00:03:21.225
Where are you going again, sis?

41
00:03:21.268 --> 00:03:23.836
Shopping and then
a few nights at Evie s.


42
00:03:23.879 --> 00:03:27.883
Paid? Fetish? Adrian?
Isn t that the name of that


43
00:03:27.927 --> 00:03:29.537
creepy photographer guy?

44
00:03:29.581 --> 00:03:31.365
Give it a rest Cass.

45
00:03:31.409 --> 00:03:32.821
You know what Mum
says about your modeling.


46
00:03:32.845 --> 00:03:34.064
You promised her.

47
00:03:34.107 --> 00:03:36.066
And you care, why?

48
00:03:36.109 --> 00:03:38.285
You could always

49
00:03:38.329 --> 00:03:40.418
buy my silence.

50
00:03:40.461 --> 00:03:41.680
Get lost Cass.

51
00:03:41.723 --> 00:03:46.337
Oh, and Mum knows
about the tattoos, yeah?


52
00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:50.732
Liam, Liam can you
come here for a minute?


53
00:03:50.776 --> 00:03:53.387
Seriously! Give it a rest.

54
00:03:53.431 --> 00:03:56.129
So many secrets.

55
00:03:56.173 --> 00:03:59.132
What ve I got to
do to shut you up?


56
00:03:59.176 --> 00:04:00.264
You need to ask?

57
00:04:00.307 --> 00:04:03.267
Ugh! Fucks sake.
You can have it.


58
00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:05.312
What are you girls up to?

59
00:04:07.836 --> 00:04:11.057
Cass? Mira? What s going on?

60
00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:14.800
Girls?

61
00:04:14.843 --> 00:04:18.456
Oh, it s nothing bad.
Sorry about all the fuss.


62
00:04:18.499 --> 00:04:21.807
I just wanted to know what

63
00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:26.203
Also, Mira wants to
swap rooms. Don t you Sis?


64
00:04:26.246 --> 00:04:28.596
Yeah, Sis. You ll get it.

65
00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:31.599

66
00:04:31.643 --> 00:04:33.732
it is your Mother s.

67
00:04:33.775 --> 00:04:35.995
Good. Don t do that to me
though. I thought there was


68
00:04:36.038 --> 00:04:38.452
something wrong and no need for
the big reveal next time Cass,


69
00:04:38.476 --> 00:04:40.913

Can I borrow some cash. Please?

94
00:06:00.601 --> 00:06:02.884

95
00:06:02.908 --> 00:06:05.911
be this expensive. Alright,

101
00:06:17.314 --> 00:06:19.403
This time I'm going, alright?

102
00:07:06.754 --> 00:07:08.365

Let s not go there.

108
00:07:39.613 --> 00:07:42.529
Oh, for fucks sake Liam.
Everybody dresses like this now.


109
00:07:42.573 --> 00:07:45.619
Your Mother doesn t. And
anyway, just because everyone


110
00:07:45.663 --> 00:07:48.013
does it, doesn t make it
right Mira. I don t wanna see


111
00:07:48.056 --> 00:07:50.450
your arse cheeks
splashed all over Face Tube.


112
00:07:50.494 --> 00:07:52.583
It s book. Not tube.

113
00:07:52.626 --> 00:07:53.758
No, it s on the internet.

114
00:07:53.801 --> 00:07:55.281
Yeah, it s a website.

115
00:07:55.325 --> 00:07:58.502
I don t care about that, just go
up and get changed. Now!


116
00:07:58.545 --> 00:08:02.288
Fine and while I'm at it I ll

117
00:08:02.332 --> 00:08:03.768
keep me under lock and key!

118
00:08:03.811 --> 00:08:07.902
It s not like that. Look,
it, it s for your own good.


119
00:08:07.946 --> 00:08:09.948
You re not a sex object.

120
00:08:09.991 --> 00:08:14.082
I don t want men ogling you left
and right and up the middle.


121
00:08:14.126 --> 00:08:15.649
Ugh!

122
00:08:15.693 --> 00:08:18.391
Mira! Mira!

123
00:08:18.435 --> 00:08:20.741
The one thing that your
mother and me decided was that


124
00:08:20.785 --> 00:08:24.963
I'll treat you like you're
mine. You girls are mine now.


125
00:08:25.006 --> 00:08:27.444
There s more to
you than, than your looks.


126
00:08:33.754 --> 00:08:35.974
Runts don t get laid. They
get ripped from their Mama s


127
00:08:36.017 --> 00:08:39.194
breast and drowned in a
burlap sack. You want that?


128
00:08:39.238 --> 00:08:41.719
You think you re gonna get
anywhere without getting fucking


129
00:08:41.762 --> 00:08:45.418
ripped? Chicks don t go down
on nerds. You wanna be a nerd?


130
00:08:45.462 --> 00:08:50.031
Grow a pair! Then get
yourself some Fucking guns!


131
00:08:50.075 --> 00:08:52.991
You still here? You want people
to think you re batting for the


132
00:08:53.034 --> 00:08:55.776
other team? Want them to think
you ain't got what it takes


133
00:08:55.820 --> 00:08:59.476
to be a real man? Think you re
better off planning a tea party


134
00:08:59.519 --> 00:09:03.523
for your dollies? Think again!
Time to get off your fat ass.


135
00:09:03.567 --> 00:09:06.874
Wipe that spunk off your
hand and change your life.


136
00:09:06.918 --> 00:09:10.443
Money! Chicks!
Everything you ever wanted!


137
00:09:10.487 --> 00:09:14.099

I've got a lot on
my mind right now April.


151
00:10:01.059 --> 00:10:04.279
See, this is why you
have no luck with women.


152
00:10:06.064 --> 00:10:07.500
I understand.

153
00:10:07.544 --> 00:10:09.894
You know, sometimes...

154
00:10:09.937 --> 00:10:13.506
I wonder how...

155
00:10:13.550 --> 00:10:15.682
We are...

156
00:10:15.726 --> 00:10:18.337
Related.

157
00:10:18.380 --> 00:10:21.427
Only by Mother. Ugh!

158
00:10:21.471 --> 00:10:24.691
Well, it still counts.

159
00:10:26.693 --> 00:10:30.610
Why do you think
we grew up apart?


160
00:10:30.654 --> 00:10:35.615
Which reminds me,
mother s sick. Call her.


161
00:10:35.659 --> 00:10:38.444
I ll call her in my own time.

162
00:10:38.488 --> 00:10:39.856
She did leave me
while I was breastfeeding.


163
00:10:39.880 --> 00:10:43.362
Ugh. You were Six years old!

164
00:10:43.405 --> 00:10:45.930
I was not!

165
00:10:45.973 --> 00:10:48.193
Make an effort.

166
00:10:48.236 --> 00:10:49.760
I will.

167
00:10:49.803 --> 00:10:52.414
I...

168
00:10:52.458 --> 00:10:54.504
Love you.

169
00:10:55.766 --> 00:10:57.115
Brother.

170
00:12:15.236 --> 00:12:16.629
Ugh!

171
00:13:07.985 --> 00:13:10.683
Way-hey-hey.

172
00:13:12.772 --> 00:13:14.774
Alright, sweetheart?

173
00:13:14.818 --> 00:13:17.081
Where you going, huh?

174
00:13:17.734 --> 00:13:19.736
See your boyfriend?

175
00:13:21.259 --> 00:13:23.696
Oops!

176
00:13:23.740 --> 00:13:26.046
Dropped my fucking cigarette.

177
00:13:40.887 --> 00:13:42.236
Ugh!

178
00:14:22.059 --> 00:14:24.801
And then last
Christmas he did it again.


179
00:14:24.844 --> 00:14:26.367
He tried to touch you?

180
00:14:26.411 --> 00:14:29.762
Oh, come on. He ll try it on
with anyone but you just need


181
00:14:29.806 --> 00:14:32.373
to look at him to
know that he s harmless.


182
00:14:32.417 --> 00:14:35.768
In fact let me tell you
the story about Adrian.


183
00:14:35.812 --> 00:14:39.511
He started off as they all do.
Wanting to be respected. He was


184
00:14:39.554 --> 00:14:43.776
doing weddings, kid s parties,
even pet portraits. He would


185
00:14:43.820 --> 00:14:47.214
literally have hundreds of
ideas every time you turned up.


186
00:14:47.258 --> 00:14:49.651
Can you stand?

187
00:14:49.695 --> 00:14:53.307
Okay. Face each other this way.

188
00:14:53.351 --> 00:14:56.484
You ve just got to put your
hands together. Lovers embrace.


189
00:14:56.528 --> 00:14:59.444
I don t need you anymore.

190
00:14:59.487 --> 00:15:02.795
Genuinely, I thought this guy
might really have something.


191
00:15:22.597 --> 00:15:27.559
Then it happened. He did a
nude shoot and things changed.


192
00:15:27.602 --> 00:15:29.126
He changed.

193
00:15:42.704 --> 00:15:45.620
The shoot locations
started to become his kitchen,


194
00:15:45.664 --> 00:15:48.710
his bedroom, his garden,

195
00:15:48.754 --> 00:15:50.321
even a car park.

196
00:16:05.510 --> 00:16:07.251
Then he went too far.

197
00:17:02.872 --> 00:17:04.482
What the fuck are you doing?

198
00:17:12.272 --> 00:17:15.275
What the fuck you think
you re... Get the fuck out!


199
00:17:15.319 --> 00:17:18.322
You stupid freak. Get out!

200
00:17:19.453 --> 00:17:23.022
What the fuck Adrian?

201
00:17:23.066 --> 00:17:25.938
Stop fucking filming me
right now, you fucking idiot.


202
00:17:25.982 --> 00:17:29.333
I'm gonna come down there
and fucking smash your face in.


203
00:17:29.376 --> 00:17:30.377
Get out!

204
00:17:31.988 --> 00:17:33.990
It s taken him a long
time to get people working


205
00:17:34.033 --> 00:17:35.513
with him again.

206
00:17:35.556 --> 00:17:37.341
So, why do you work with him?

207
00:17:37.384 --> 00:17:39.865
Oh, he pays well. Very well.

208
00:17:39.909 --> 00:17:42.737
I guess. I'm just having second
thoughts about prancing around


209
00:17:42.781 --> 00:17:45.871
and showing off my body.
Feels a bit like teasing.


210
00:17:45.915 --> 00:17:47.109
Someone thinks a lot of herself.

211
00:17:47.133 --> 00:17:48.743
Bitch.

212
00:17:48.787 --> 00:17:52.008
Honey. There ll be a group of us
there with you. It s safe to say


213
00:17:52.051 --> 00:17:54.097
that no harm will come
to you with us around.


214
00:17:54.140 --> 00:17:57.578
I know. I know he s just a weedy
guy who likes to look at girls.


215
00:17:57.622 --> 00:17:59.687
It s not like I d be doing
the job if I didn t know that.


216
00:17:59.711 --> 00:18:01.843
Oh, what s not to like?
Turning guys into dogs and


217
00:18:01.887 --> 00:18:03.082
getting paid for the privilege.

218
00:18:03.106 --> 00:18:04.977
Here, here! Men are weak.

219
00:18:05.021 --> 00:18:06.761
Isn t that a bit sexist?

220
00:18:06.805 --> 00:18:09.634
I'm not the one paying him to
walk around in his underwear.


221
00:18:09.677 --> 00:18:12.767
Does anyone know what time
he said we d be finished by?


222
00:18:12.811 --> 00:18:15.379
He didn t say. All I know is
that we re being paid at


223
00:18:15.422 --> 00:18:17.424
an hourly rate.

224
00:18:17.468 --> 00:18:19.731
I don t really understand
why he needs five of us.


225
00:18:19.774 --> 00:18:21.602
- Six
- What?


226
00:18:21.646 --> 00:18:23.604
There are six of us.

227
00:18:31.047 --> 00:18:33.614
Hey Mira, maybe
you should borrow that sign.


228
00:18:33.658 --> 00:18:35.486
Just stop.

229
00:18:35.529 --> 00:18:38.532
Ana, you re so
funny. You know that?


230
00:18:38.576 --> 00:18:40.839
I do actually.

231
00:18:40.882 --> 00:18:42.884
No Entry.

232
00:18:42.928 --> 00:18:45.235
That's hardly
welcoming now is it?


233
00:18:45.278 --> 00:18:47.778
Yeah, well he knows that but you
know he s having a problem with


234
00:18:47.802 --> 00:18:49.065
cold callers so.

235
00:18:49.108 --> 00:18:50.631
What? Out here?

236
00:18:50.675 --> 00:18:53.286
That's what he said. Anyway
look, it s just down there.


237
00:18:53.330 --> 00:18:54.679
Can we please keep going?

238
00:18:54.722 --> 00:18:56.594
C'mon, Let s get going.

239
00:18:56.637 --> 00:18:58.615
I knew I should have
broken these bloody things in.


240
00:18:58.639 --> 00:19:00.990
Sorry guys, I gotta
change to flip flops.


241
00:19:01.033 --> 00:19:02.121
Sexy mama!

242
00:19:02.165 --> 00:19:03.818
Sexier than blisters.

243
00:19:19.660 --> 00:19:21.812
It looks more like an industrial
estate than someone s home


244
00:19:21.836 --> 00:19:25.579
to me and what
are those cages for?


245
00:19:25.623 --> 00:19:27.059
I'm kinda in
to that sort of thing.


246
00:19:27.103 --> 00:19:29.670
That's the studio, moron.

247
00:19:29.714 --> 00:19:32.978
These industrial areas provide
very cost efficient solutions


248
00:19:33.022 --> 00:19:35.111
for today s modern artists.

249
00:19:52.824 --> 00:19:54.130
Adrian, we re here!

250
00:19:54.173 --> 00:19:55.870
- Yeah, yeah.
- I'm coming, I'm coming.


251
00:19:55.914 --> 00:19:58.525
There s probably
a lot of truth in that.


252
00:20:05.315 --> 00:20:06.838
You came!

253
00:20:06.881 --> 00:20:08.274
You all came!

254
00:20:08.318 --> 00:20:10.450
Of course we came.
We re professionals.


255
00:20:10.494 --> 00:20:12.539
Yeah, we re really
looking forward to it Adrian.


256
00:20:12.583 --> 00:20:14.387
And wow. You re looking
really different from the


257
00:20:14.411 --> 00:20:16.369
last time I saw you.
You been working out?


258
00:20:16.413 --> 00:20:19.285
Oh, you know.
I like to work on my body.


259
00:20:19.329 --> 00:20:21.070
Could say that again.

260
00:20:23.376 --> 00:20:26.162
Yeah, I've been
looking forward to this too.


261
00:20:26.205 --> 00:20:28.686
Thanks. Can we come in?
We re kind of hot and thirsty


262
00:20:28.729 --> 00:20:30.427
after walking so far.

263
00:20:30.470 --> 00:20:32.690
Oh, yeah! Let me
give you a hand.


264
00:20:49.924 --> 00:20:52.057
Be nice. Okay?

265
00:20:54.538 --> 00:20:57.715
I don t know what the problem
is. He always pays on time.


266
00:21:07.203 --> 00:21:09.683
Couldn't we have waited outside
until we had some light on?


267
00:21:09.727 --> 00:21:11.183
- It s fine.
- It ll be on in a minute.


268
00:21:11.207 --> 00:21:14.253
Wow. It is creepy in the dark.

269
00:21:14.297 --> 00:21:17.648
- Ahh! Oh, I'm sorry babe.
- Ahh! Shhhh.


270
00:21:17.691 --> 00:21:19.258
Honey, that wasn t very nice.

271
00:21:19.302 --> 00:21:20.738
You re so gonna get it for that!

272
00:21:20.781 --> 00:21:24.307
I'm sorry I just
wanted to lighten the mood.


273
00:21:26.222 --> 00:21:28.572
- Speaking of light.
- Thank fuck for that.


274
00:21:28.615 --> 00:21:31.792
And you live here
now as well, Adrian?


275
00:21:31.836 --> 00:21:34.447
Yeah, I sold the luxury pad
my Dad left me and bought this


276
00:21:34.491 --> 00:21:37.015
whole place. Can you believe it?

277
00:21:37.058 --> 00:21:40.366
No. I really can t.

278
00:21:40.410 --> 00:21:43.195
Yeah, well if you ladies
wait by the table I've got a


279
00:21:43.239 --> 00:21:45.023
surprise for you.

280
00:21:46.851 --> 00:21:49.462
Well, that was strange.

281
00:21:49.506 --> 00:21:51.116
Not surprising though.

282
00:21:51.160 --> 00:21:55.381
Come on guys. He s probably
just nervous. You heard him.


283
00:21:55.425 --> 00:21:56.948
He s got a surprise for us.

284
00:21:56.991 --> 00:22:00.256
Yeah, probably a meat
cleaver and a mask made out of


285
00:22:00.299 --> 00:22:01.953
his Mother s face.

286
00:22:01.996 --> 00:22:03.476
Ana!

287
00:22:03.520 --> 00:22:05.522
You re so hard on him.

288
00:22:05.565 --> 00:22:08.873
Okay. Let s do what he asks
and wait to find out what our


289
00:22:08.916 --> 00:22:10.440
surprise is.

290
00:22:10.483 --> 00:22:12.244
Oh, come on! He s not stupid
enough to do something with


291
00:22:12.268 --> 00:22:13.834
the Six of us here.

292
00:22:13.878 --> 00:22:17.273
Exactly. I come here
plenty of times on my own.


293
00:22:17.316 --> 00:22:18.839
I d heard.

294
00:22:18.883 --> 00:22:20.145
Seriously?

295
00:22:34.290 --> 00:22:36.640
Good god.

296
00:22:36.683 --> 00:22:41.079
- Ugh, what s next?
- Pass the parcel?


297
00:22:41.122 --> 00:22:42.428
Come, come, sit.

298
00:22:42.472 --> 00:22:44.300
Why is there
a knife on the table?


299
00:22:44.343 --> 00:22:46.606
Ahh. Ha-ha.

300
00:22:50.697 --> 00:22:53.004
Ahhh, hold on.

301
00:22:57.487 --> 00:22:58.836
Ohhh.

302
00:22:58.879 --> 00:23:03.275
♪ AND I PRAY
I-I-I PRAY ♪


303
00:23:06.409 --> 00:23:08.280
♪ I AM WAITING FOR YOU

304
00:23:08.324 --> 00:23:11.501
- He's gonna hurt himself.
- Oh my god.


305
00:23:15.853 --> 00:23:17.376
Oh my god.

306
00:23:20.640 --> 00:23:22.076
Ohhh!

307
00:23:22.120 --> 00:23:25.079
Shhh. He s coming back.
He s coming back. Shhshhshh!


308
00:23:28.648 --> 00:23:29.910
Uhh, Drink.

309
00:23:29.954 --> 00:23:31.129
- Please.
- Ugh.


310
00:23:32.739 --> 00:23:33.784
Oh!

311
00:23:33.827 --> 00:23:35.699
Slow down Adrian.

312
00:23:38.136 --> 00:23:39.920
Ah, drink.

313
00:23:39.964 --> 00:23:42.009
Oh! Uh, no, no, no.

314
00:23:45.665 --> 00:23:47.450
What is this?

315
00:23:50.496 --> 00:23:52.368
Da-da-daaa.

316
00:23:54.761 --> 00:23:57.024
Wow! Woah!

317
00:23:59.636 --> 00:24:01.725
Took me uhh,
Seven uhh-uh, Twelve,


318
00:24:01.768 --> 00:24:04.815
twelve hours to make that.

319
00:24:04.858 --> 00:24:07.426
But what exactly
are we celebrating?


320
00:24:07.470 --> 00:24:10.342
Yeah Adrian, what
exactly are we celebrating?


321
00:24:10.386 --> 00:24:13.650
Oh, well, uh, we are celebra-
all together we are celebrating


322
00:24:13.693 --> 00:24:15.739
my retirement.

323
00:24:15.782 --> 00:24:17.107
Here s to me never
having to work again.


324
00:24:17.131 --> 00:24:19.003
But you re so young like.

325
00:24:19.046 --> 00:24:22.267
Well, thank you. You can do
anything you put your mind to.


326
00:24:24.443 --> 00:24:26.576
Um. Umm.

327
00:24:28.404 --> 00:24:31.015
Is he okay?

328
00:24:32.712 --> 00:24:35.062
Well,

329
00:24:35.106 --> 00:24:36.368
free champers and cake.

330
00:24:36.412 --> 00:24:39.240
This shoot just got
a hell of a lot better.


331
00:24:39.284 --> 00:24:41.678
We should take advantage of
it. My last shoot I got a bag of


332
00:24:41.721 --> 00:24:44.463
crisps and a
jug full of tap water.


333
00:24:44.507 --> 00:24:47.466
Well, you ve changed
your tune. I'm not too sure.


334
00:24:47.510 --> 00:24:50.817
Drinking on the job is not
very professional now, is it?


335
00:24:50.861 --> 00:24:53.603
Alright, little miss goody
two shoes, I ll have yours.


336
00:24:53.646 --> 00:24:56.475
I was just saying you know. I
don t want word going around


337
00:24:56.519 --> 00:24:58.085
I'm doing things I shouldn t.

338
00:24:58.129 --> 00:25:00.325
Sweetheart, you re a model.
Doing things you shouldn t will


339
00:25:00.349 --> 00:25:02.263
probably up your rep.

340
00:25:02.307 --> 00:25:04.701
In fact, I can think of two
off the top of my head that are


341
00:25:04.744 --> 00:25:06.703
doing rather
well for themselves.


342
00:25:06.746 --> 00:25:08.574
Ana don t. Jane s right.

343
00:25:08.618 --> 00:25:10.160
It s up to her if she
doesn t want to drink.


344
00:25:10.184 --> 00:25:14.493
Yeah, leave her alone. Me on
the other hand, fill her up!


345
00:25:16.452 --> 00:25:19.411
Where s Adrian?
We need a bottle opener.


346
00:25:19.455 --> 00:25:20.586
- Thank you.
- He s gone.


347
00:25:20.630 --> 00:25:22.240
Adrian?

348
00:25:25.591 --> 00:25:28.420
Adrian? Where are you?

349
00:25:28.464 --> 00:25:31.815
Yeah, Adrian. Where
are you? Mira needs you.


350
00:25:31.858 --> 00:25:33.947
Hahahaha.

351
00:26:23.519 --> 00:26:25.085
Stop it

352
00:26:25.521 --> 00:26:28.306
Stop it, stop it,
stop it, stop it, stop it!


353
00:26:33.746 --> 00:26:36.488
Adrian?

354
00:26:36.532 --> 00:26:37.663
Hi.

355
00:26:52.591 --> 00:26:54.724
There you are.
Where have you been?


356
00:26:54.767 --> 00:26:59.337
And why are you
limping? Or should I not ask?


357
00:26:59.380 --> 00:27:02.340
Adrian? Surely not?

358
00:27:02.383 --> 00:27:06.779
No! I uhh, I umm.

359
00:27:06.823 --> 00:27:11.480
Of course not.
Umm, It s my fault.


360
00:27:11.523 --> 00:27:14.918
I asked him to get

361
00:27:14.961 --> 00:27:18.574
a bottle opener then I realized

362
00:27:18.617 --> 00:27:20.967
that they were
champagne bottles so...


363
00:27:21.011 --> 00:27:23.143
And did you?

364
00:27:23.187 --> 00:27:24.188
What?

365
00:27:24.231 --> 00:27:25.798
Get a bottle opener?

366
00:27:25.842 --> 00:27:30.237
No. Because I shouted to him

367
00:27:30.281 --> 00:27:31.543
that we didn t need one.

368
00:27:31.587 --> 00:27:33.197
- I see.
- Um, without sounding like


369
00:27:33.240 --> 00:27:36.548
a pig, I mean, when do we
get to try the cake? Come on.


370
00:27:36.592 --> 00:27:39.377
W-without sounding like a
party pooper could we leave


371
00:27:39.420 --> 00:27:40.572
the cake till after shooting?

372
00:27:40.596 --> 00:27:41.858
Whatever you ladies want.

373
00:27:41.901 --> 00:27:43.686
Yeah, as much as I
want to devour that thing,


374
00:27:43.729 --> 00:27:44.991
I have to agree.

375
00:27:45.035 --> 00:27:46.515
Why?

376
00:27:46.558 --> 00:27:48.057
I'm assuming these outfits
are tiny and I need to stay


377
00:27:48.081 --> 00:27:49.996
that way too.

378
00:27:50.040 --> 00:27:51.887
Uh, yeah, I can take your
bags through to the next room


379
00:27:51.911 --> 00:27:53.193
and you can start to
get comfortable and...


380
00:27:53.217 --> 00:27:55.132
- Yeah?
- Is there anywhere for us to


381
00:27:55.175 --> 00:27:57.047
change? I came ready last time.

382
00:27:57.090 --> 00:27:58.439
Oh, there s a screen.

383
00:27:58.483 --> 00:28:01.138
You can use that or,
or not if you don t want to.


384
00:28:01.181 --> 00:28:05.359
Screen s fine, thanks.

385
00:28:05.403 --> 00:28:08.537
Alright. Well, uhh, grab a
bottle and follow me through.


386
00:28:39.655 --> 00:28:41.439
Is he okay?

387
00:28:43.920 --> 00:28:46.139
Oh. Umm.

388
00:28:50.970 --> 00:28:53.669
Umm. Our bags Adrian?

389
00:28:53.712 --> 00:28:58.064
Yes! I ll go and you
girls occupy yourselves.


390
00:28:58.108 --> 00:29:01.241
Oh my god.
What is wrong with him?


391
00:29:03.940 --> 00:29:06.551
Right. Guys, let s
make the most of this.


392
00:29:06.595 --> 00:29:08.031
- Yeah.
- I think we should.


393
00:29:08.074 --> 00:29:12.122
Let s make Adrian the
perv's last ever night.


394
00:29:12.165 --> 00:29:16.256
Something for him to remember
for many nights to come.


395
00:29:16.300 --> 00:29:19.085
- Cheers girls.
- Cheers!


396
00:29:21.044 --> 00:29:23.307
Hey, this stuff isn t half
bad even if it is made


397
00:29:23.350 --> 00:29:24.961
out of polyester.

398
00:29:41.804 --> 00:29:44.676
Is that a hat?
Can you pass me the hat?


399
00:29:44.720 --> 00:29:47.157
Check this out.

400
00:29:47.200 --> 00:29:49.202
Nice how much did
they set you back?


401
00:29:49.246 --> 00:29:51.770
A hundred percent
all mine sweetie.


402
00:29:59.343 --> 00:30:00.431
Hahaha!

403
00:30:43.779 --> 00:30:45.084
Let's go, let's do it.

404
00:30:45.128 --> 00:30:46.738
I'm taking my...

405
00:30:46.782 --> 00:30:49.915
Oh Adrian, where are you?

406
00:30:49.959 --> 00:30:52.352
Mira needs you.

407
00:31:01.753 --> 00:31:06.627
Umm, Adrian. Why is the
sixth outfit a nurses outfit


408
00:31:06.671 --> 00:31:09.761
like, when this is meant to
be a sports themed shoot?


409
00:31:09.805 --> 00:31:12.895
Like, there was
a cricket bat in there.


410
00:31:14.810 --> 00:31:17.334
It doesn't matter.

411
00:31:17.377 --> 00:31:19.423
Okay, shall we start
shooting? You ve got your hands


412
00:31:19.466 --> 00:31:21.468
on my props.
Let s, let s, let's go!


413
00:31:21.512 --> 00:31:23.688

Okay.

417
00:31:46.232 --> 00:31:48.582
Are we done yet?

418

See you in a minute Adrian. Tsk.

460
00:35:04.300 --> 00:35:06.911
You are such a
tease, do you know that?


461
00:35:08.260 --> 00:35:12.612
Come on guys.
Look, he s only human.


462
00:35:12.656 --> 00:35:15.876
If he didn't have a boner, I d
be worried I d lost my touch.


463
00:35:15.920 --> 00:35:18.053
Yeah, and there are six of us.

464
00:35:18.096 --> 00:35:21.360
That's enough to make anyone
horny. Isn t that right, Sera?


465
00:35:21.404 --> 00:35:23.449
I see you getting
all hot under the collar


466
00:35:23.493 --> 00:35:25.060
Shut up!

467
00:35:25.103 --> 00:35:27.714
Why you sticking up for him?
Come to think of it, you ve been


468
00:35:27.758 --> 00:35:31.327
nothing but sugary sweet to
him all day. What s going on?


469
00:35:31.370 --> 00:35:33.938
- Mm, yeah.
- Maybe she s doing him.


470
00:35:33.982 --> 00:35:37.115
I mean he s tried
it on with all of us.


471
00:35:37.159 --> 00:35:38.943
She couldn't resist his charms.

472
00:35:38.987 --> 00:35:40.379
Ana!

473
00:35:42.729 --> 00:35:45.428
Mira, Mira on the wall.

474
00:35:45.471 --> 00:35:49.475
Give me a kiss and I ll make
you the biggest star of all.


475
00:35:49.519 --> 00:35:52.870
Oh Adrian,
really? Do you promise?


476
00:35:56.134 --> 00:35:58.267
Give me some credit guys.

477
00:35:58.310 --> 00:36:02.445
Look, I'm not blind
and I'm not stupid.


478
00:36:02.488 --> 00:36:05.578
I wouldn t let that creepy
little man anywhere near me.


479
00:36:05.622 --> 00:36:06.623
I just,

480
00:36:07.841 --> 00:36:10.496
I feel sorry
for him, that's all.


481
00:36:10.540 --> 00:36:14.152
And besides,
it s his last shoot.


482
00:36:14.196 --> 00:36:16.676
We may as well
make the most of it.


483
00:36:16.720 --> 00:36:18.983
I know. I was just teasing.

484
00:36:19.027 --> 00:36:21.768
Fine. I mean, ugggh!

485
00:36:21.812 --> 00:36:23.292
Haha!

486
00:36:25.163 --> 00:36:28.558
- He is!
- C'mon.


487
00:36:28.601 --> 00:36:30.734
I love you Mira.

488
00:36:36.609 --> 00:36:39.438
Fucking stu-stupid

489
00:36:46.489 --> 00:36:48.099
Come on.

490
00:36:51.015 --> 00:36:53.713
Calm down.

491
00:36:53.757 --> 00:36:56.325
They ll be screaming
your name before the end.


492
00:37:06.987 --> 00:37:09.251
Ah Adrian, you re
the best host ever.


493
00:37:09.294 --> 00:37:12.906
Well, umm, you
girls can have a little break,


494
00:37:12.950 --> 00:37:16.127
a little uh, picnic
or whatever and uh, oh.


495
00:37:22.133 --> 00:37:23.700
You can have your
cake and eat it too.


496
00:37:23.743 --> 00:37:25.615
That's mine, that's m...

497
00:37:25.658 --> 00:37:27.356
I ll be over here
if you need me.


498
00:37:28.922 --> 00:37:30.794
Was that supposed to be a joke?

499
00:37:30.837 --> 00:37:33.971
I think he missed the
concept of what one actually is.


500
00:37:34.014 --> 00:37:38.410
Ha-ha. Do you ever let up?
Remind me never to get on the


501
00:37:38.454 --> 00:37:40.369
wrong side of you.

502
00:37:40.412 --> 00:37:41.631
Indeed.

503
00:37:41.674 --> 00:37:43.198
Fucking hell.

504
00:37:46.070 --> 00:37:50.770
Adrian, do you need a hand?

505
00:37:50.814 --> 00:37:53.860
Sweetie, no
offense but look at you.


506
00:37:53.904 --> 00:37:55.035
Let me have a go.

507
00:37:55.079 --> 00:37:57.255
No, it s alright,
I've been working out.


508
00:37:57.299 --> 00:37:59.364
Come on Adrian. Let me help
you. We don t wanna be in this


509
00:37:59.388 --> 00:38:01.564
warehouse all night.

510
00:38:19.843 --> 00:38:21.584
See, there s no
need to be stubborn.


511
00:38:21.627 --> 00:38:24.282
Oh-oh, it s a cage.

512
00:38:24.326 --> 00:38:27.633
I love that sort of thing.
Unexpected originality from


513
00:38:27.677 --> 00:38:29.940
a guy I thought
didn t have it in him.


514
00:38:29.983 --> 00:38:31.768
I actually love
this kind of thing.


515
00:38:31.811 --> 00:38:32.769
- Really?
- Yeah.


516
00:38:32.812 --> 00:38:33.900
You do?

517
00:38:33.944 --> 00:38:36.599
Ugh. Why is that
so hard to believe?


518
00:38:36.642 --> 00:38:38.818
You just don t
strike me as the type.


519
00:38:38.862 --> 00:38:42.126
This kind of thing is weird if
you ask me. Only real creeps


520
00:38:42.170 --> 00:38:43.475
are into whips and chains.

521
00:38:43.519 --> 00:38:45.738
Don t be such a fucking prude!

522
00:38:45.782 --> 00:38:49.742
I'm no prude. I just find it
weird that people get pleasure


523
00:38:49.786 --> 00:38:51.875
out of causing each other pain.

524
00:38:51.918 --> 00:38:55.835
It s not all about the pain
and uh, don t knock it until


525
00:38:55.879 --> 00:38:58.490
you ve tried it, huh?

526
00:38:58.534 --> 00:39:00.468
Right, this is gonna take
a bit longer than I thought so


527
00:39:00.492 --> 00:39:01.730
you guys can go and get changed.

528
00:39:01.754 --> 00:39:03.843
I ve, I've got some
more props for you.


529
00:39:07.804 --> 00:39:08.848
Oh.

530
00:39:08.892 --> 00:39:12.243
Just uhh, Take your pick.

531
00:39:12.287 --> 00:39:14.637
Well, hello!

532
00:39:14.680 --> 00:39:15.986
Ooh!

533
00:39:16.029 --> 00:39:18.162
Hahahaha.

534
00:39:26.475 --> 00:39:28.738

Well,

587
00:43:27.063 --> 00:43:31.023
that was the shoot to end
all shoots. Thank you Ladies.


588
00:43:31.067 --> 00:43:32.982
Well, you wanted to
go out with a bang.


589
00:43:33.025 --> 00:43:34.374
It was fun.

590
00:43:34.418 --> 00:43:37.247
Yeah Sera, I will never
diss before I try again.


591
00:43:37.290 --> 00:43:38.814
Told you.

592
00:43:38.857 --> 00:43:43.253
So Adrian, did that shoot make
you hotter than the last one?


593
00:43:43.296 --> 00:43:45.516
Bet this makes you even hotter.

594
00:43:48.606 --> 00:43:49.955
Ugh!

595
00:43:58.573 --> 00:44:00.923
Wish I d got that on camera.

596
00:44:02.577 --> 00:44:06.102
Uh-uh-uh, drink up
ladies. The night is young.


597
00:44:10.889 --> 00:44:12.325
Happy retirement Adrian.

598
00:44:12.369 --> 00:44:13.675
Yeah.

599
00:46:00.303 --> 00:46:01.826
Adrian!

600
00:46:02.958 --> 00:46:04.655
- This is not on!
- What the hell?


601
00:46:04.699 --> 00:46:06.657
This had better
be a fucking joke.


602
00:46:08.311 --> 00:46:10.443
Get me out of this fucking cage.

603
00:46:10.487 --> 00:46:13.664
It s ok. Just look towards
the light. We re here hun.


604
00:46:15.361 --> 00:46:17.668
I wanna go home.
I wanna go home now.


605
00:46:27.417 --> 00:46:30.246
Everyone just shut up!

606
00:46:33.728 --> 00:46:36.644
Adrian, what are you doing?

607
00:46:36.687 --> 00:46:39.255
You don t know me.

608
00:46:39.298 --> 00:46:42.867
Or taken the time to find
anything about about my life.


609
00:46:43.825 --> 00:46:46.828
You make me feel
like I'm a nobody.


610
00:46:46.871 --> 00:46:49.526
Boo-hoo! Grow up.

611
00:46:51.571 --> 00:46:53.182
Adrian,

612
00:46:54.749 --> 00:46:56.838
modeling is my job.

613
00:46:56.881 --> 00:46:59.971
I'm not in this to make friends.

614
00:47:00.015 --> 00:47:04.193
I'm sorry I made you
feel this way. I like you.


615
00:47:04.759 --> 00:47:08.588
No, uh, just let us out

616
00:47:08.632 --> 00:47:10.765
and we can be friends.

617
00:47:10.808 --> 00:47:13.985
I heard you Mira.

618
00:47:14.029 --> 00:47:16.814
I disgust you.

619
00:47:16.858 --> 00:47:18.990
It wasn t like that.

620
00:47:19.034 --> 00:47:21.427
If I were you,
I d save your energy.


621
00:47:21.471 --> 00:47:22.646
What s that supposed to mean?

622
00:47:22.690 --> 00:47:24.517
And why do you keep
looking at your phone?


623
00:47:24.561 --> 00:47:27.999
It will become clear
right before your very eyes.


624
00:47:28.043 --> 00:47:29.044
See,

625
00:47:30.349 --> 00:47:34.353
I've tried everything
to get you to like me.


626
00:47:34.397 --> 00:47:38.444
You called me scrawny.
You knocked me back.


627
00:47:38.488 --> 00:47:41.665
- Ridiculed me.
- That s not true.


628
00:47:42.448 --> 00:47:44.929
I d never hurt you.

629
00:47:44.973 --> 00:47:47.584
It s not in my blood.

630
00:47:47.627 --> 00:47:49.891
Two of you however do have
it in your blood and we ll be


631
00:47:49.934 --> 00:47:52.676
finding out who
they are very soon.


632
00:47:52.720 --> 00:47:54.286
Adrian, what have you done?

633
00:47:54.330 --> 00:47:58.769
What have I done? Well, I ve
been working on my body for you.


634
00:47:58.813 --> 00:48:00.466
I started using this supplement.

635
00:48:00.510 --> 00:48:02.991
It had some very
interesting side effects.


636
00:48:03.034 --> 00:48:05.515
I remember injecting myself.

637
00:48:06.864 --> 00:48:08.518
I d black out.

638
00:48:08.561 --> 00:48:10.781
I d wake up in the morning and

639
00:48:10.825 --> 00:48:12.914
the room would be damaged.

640
00:48:13.436 --> 00:48:15.786
Wounded my body.

641
00:48:15.830 --> 00:48:19.355
So, I started to film
myself and the video made for


642
00:48:19.398 --> 00:48:20.549
very interesting viewing. I uh...

643
00:48:20.573 --> 00:48:22.575
You are sick.

644
00:48:24.360 --> 00:48:26.492
Became a different person.

645
00:48:27.842 --> 00:48:31.715
I uhh, fffshh, left my body.

646
00:48:33.021 --> 00:48:36.633
Became consumed with this rage

647
00:48:38.243 --> 00:48:40.811
I worked on the concoction. I
made it safe for myself to use


648
00:48:40.855 --> 00:48:44.119
without causing
myself any more harm.


649
00:48:44.162 --> 00:48:45.642
But

650
00:48:46.948 --> 00:48:49.907
it made me think.

651
00:48:49.951 --> 00:48:53.693
See, seeing that
raw energy was almost...


652
00:48:54.564 --> 00:48:55.565
Freeing.

653
00:48:57.306 --> 00:48:59.830
I came to the conclusion

654
00:48:59.874 --> 00:49:02.833
who looks better on camera than

655
00:49:02.877 --> 00:49:05.662
- models.
- Adrian!


656
00:49:05.705 --> 00:49:09.318
So two of you were injected,
before you woke up of course.


657
00:49:09.361 --> 00:49:12.451
We should be finding out
who they are very shortly.


658
00:49:12.495 --> 00:49:15.585
And look who the
lucky winners are!


659
00:49:22.157 --> 00:49:23.941
Adrian, I...

660
00:49:25.203 --> 00:49:26.204
I...

661
00:49:29.294 --> 00:49:32.254
You fucking bitch!

662
00:49:32.297 --> 00:49:34.691
Fucking going to kill you.

663
00:49:36.693 --> 00:49:39.174
Not before you kill
your friends you re not.


664
00:49:39.217 --> 00:49:43.047
Oh, don t worry you
won t know what you re doing.


665
00:49:43.091 --> 00:49:46.485
I ll get it all on camera
and show you afterwards.


666
00:49:46.529 --> 00:49:48.923
If you re still alive that is.

667
00:49:51.621 --> 00:49:54.145
I ll make you
suffer the longest.


668
00:49:56.756 --> 00:49:59.890
Adrian.

669
00:49:59.934 --> 00:50:02.197
Adrian!

670
00:50:02.240 --> 00:50:04.460
Please let us go.

671
00:50:05.765 --> 00:50:07.680
I ll do anything.

672
00:50:09.987 --> 00:50:11.946
I mean...

673
00:50:11.989 --> 00:50:13.948
Anything.

674
00:50:13.991 --> 00:50:15.906
It s too late.

675
00:50:15.950 --> 00:50:19.388
Besides, I can
look at you whenever I like.


676
00:50:22.347 --> 00:50:25.307
Oh, you, you bastard!

677
00:50:25.350 --> 00:50:27.613
Oh, don t be sad,

678
00:50:27.657 --> 00:50:29.659
you might still get out.

679
00:50:29.702 --> 00:50:31.158
Looks like the show s
about to get on the road


680
00:50:31.182 --> 00:50:32.531
so I ll clear the ring.

681
00:50:32.575 --> 00:50:34.229
The ring?

682
00:50:35.099 --> 00:50:36.100
Yes.

683
00:50:38.973 --> 00:50:41.410
The ring.

684
00:51:44.516 --> 00:51:47.911
You re going to be
part of my next masterpiece.


685
00:52:01.881 --> 00:52:04.797
Blood spattered.

686
00:52:06.930 --> 00:52:09.541
Adrian, stop it!
They re hurting each other!


687
00:52:09.585 --> 00:52:12.066
Fucking stop it!

688
00:52:12.109 --> 00:52:15.765
Don t worry, you ll all
get your chance to contribute.


689
00:52:22.032 --> 00:52:23.642
Joey, no!

690
00:52:29.474 --> 00:52:31.650
Ahhh!

691
00:52:31.694 --> 00:52:32.695
Ah!

692
00:52:34.305 --> 00:52:37.134
Stop! Stop!

693
00:52:37.178 --> 00:52:40.311
Ughh, ugh!

694
00:52:40.355 --> 00:52:43.619
Adrian! What the
fuck have you done?


695
00:52:48.102 --> 00:52:50.104
Sera!

696
00:52:55.196 --> 00:52:58.242
That looked really
good on camera!


697
00:53:00.723 --> 00:53:04.814
Don t worry,
I'm not wasting electricity!


698
00:53:04.857 --> 00:53:07.251
It s all run off a car battery!

699
00:53:07.295 --> 00:53:08.296
Clever, eh?

700
00:53:08.339 --> 00:53:09.819
You re insane.

701
00:53:09.862 --> 00:53:11.275
Oh, don t worry,
the circuit s broken before


702
00:53:11.299 --> 00:53:12.363
it reached the little pens.

703
00:53:12.387 --> 00:53:13.953
Who the hell do
you think you are?


704
00:53:13.997 --> 00:53:16.956
I'm the judge, the jury and the
executioner. I think this one


705
00:53:17.000 --> 00:53:19.046
comes down to a
points decision, don t you?


706
00:53:29.752 --> 00:53:31.928
Get the fuck off her!

707
00:53:31.971 --> 00:53:33.712
Jealous are we?

708
00:53:33.756 --> 00:53:35.888
Adrian! This is not on!

709
00:53:35.932 --> 00:53:38.630
You re right, I do
have a job to do.


710
00:53:38.674 --> 00:53:41.764
I think we have our winner.

711
00:53:41.807 --> 00:53:44.506
And we have our next challenger.

712
00:54:13.274 --> 00:54:16.015
Hi April. April,
I, I, I touched one!


713
00:54:16.059 --> 00:54:17.539
I touched one of the women.

714
00:54:17.582 --> 00:54:19.889
That's great my love,
but look it s not a good time.


715
00:54:19.932 --> 00:54:21.891
I'm with a client.

716
00:54:21.934 --> 00:54:23.477
- Sorry about this.
- No, it s just my Brother.


717
00:54:23.501 --> 00:54:26.243
No, no, no. I thought you d
be more, more excited for me.


718
00:54:26.287 --> 00:54:28.898
Trust me, I am excited.
Call me at the weekend


719
00:54:28.941 --> 00:54:31.292
and then you can
tell me all about it.


720
00:54:31.335 --> 00:54:33.076
Wh-what do I,
wh-what do I do now?


721
00:54:33.120 --> 00:54:35.644
Now, you take things up a level.

722
00:54:35.687 --> 00:54:37.341
Look, I really have to go!

723
00:54:37.385 --> 00:54:39.691
- No, no. Uh, okay.
- Speak soon my love.


724
00:54:39.735 --> 00:54:43.521
By the way. Mother said that
she hates you so stop call...


725
00:54:43.565 --> 00:54:45.567
- N-no.
- Bye


726
00:54:45.610 --> 00:54:47.221
Alice?

727
00:54:49.223 --> 00:54:50.224
Hello?

728
00:55:00.495 --> 00:55:02.497
Ahh!

729
00:55:39.011 --> 00:55:40.012
God!

730
00:55:41.536 --> 00:55:43.407
What the hell happened?

731
00:55:43.451 --> 00:55:44.974
I feel as if I ve
been hit by a truck.


732
00:55:45.017 --> 00:55:48.282
What is he doing to us?

733
00:55:48.325 --> 00:55:50.893
I want to go home.

734
00:55:50.936 --> 00:55:53.896
Shhh. Sera, it s okay.

735
00:55:53.939 --> 00:55:57.204
Look, if we just work
together we can get out of here


736
00:55:57.247 --> 00:55:58.248
before he does it again.

737
00:55:58.292 --> 00:56:00.990
Ughh! Does what again?

738
00:56:04.298 --> 00:56:07.083
All I remember

739
00:56:07.126 --> 00:56:09.346
is waking up in this cage

740
00:56:09.390 --> 00:56:12.349
and I feel like I ve
beaten half to death.


741
00:56:12.393 --> 00:56:14.221
That's because you have.

742
00:56:14.264 --> 00:56:18.268
Yo-you and Joey, he
injected you with, I don't know,


743
00:56:18.312 --> 00:56:21.663
a drug and you went at
each other like animals.


744
00:56:21.706 --> 00:56:24.448
He s fighting us
off against each other.


745
00:56:24.492 --> 00:56:28.670
Ow! Oh, god.
I did that! Sera I'm so sorry.


746
00:56:28.713 --> 00:56:31.368
I'm sorry too. 
I'm so sorr...

747
00:56:31.412 --> 00:56:34.589
I didn t know you had it in
you. You guys were ferocious.


748
00:56:34.632 --> 00:56:37.679
I mean, if you hadn t
both been knocked out then...


749
00:56:37.722 --> 00:56:41.552
Ohh, why is he doing this?

750
00:56:41.596 --> 00:56:44.773
'Cause he s
fucking nuts that's why.


751
00:56:44.816 --> 00:56:48.603
He was filming everything.
Went on about his new canvas.


752
00:56:48.646 --> 00:56:50.927
I think he was talking about
the bloodstains on the floor.


753
00:56:50.953 --> 00:56:52.171
He s sick!

754
00:56:53.303 --> 00:56:55.044
Shhhh!

755
00:56:55.087 --> 00:56:57.089
Guys, I think he s coming back.

756
00:57:03.270 --> 00:57:05.315
What s this?

757
00:57:05.359 --> 00:57:08.231
Not bitching about
me behind my back?


758
00:57:08.275 --> 00:57:09.450
Disappointed.

759
00:57:10.929 --> 00:57:13.454
Not quite so cocky now, are we?

760
00:57:15.760 --> 00:57:17.806
Please stop doing this!

761
00:57:22.376 --> 00:57:27.337
Adrian please! 
Adrian, please.

762
00:57:27.381 --> 00:57:31.428
Please stop doing
this! I ll do anything.


763
00:57:31.472 --> 00:57:35.302
Please let us go.

764
00:57:35.345 --> 00:57:36.999
Aaaah!

765
00:57:37.042 --> 00:57:40.872
Why would I let you go? Stupid!

766
00:57:40.916 --> 00:57:43.614
I'm already getting exactly what
I want. Besides, you should be


767
00:57:43.658 --> 00:57:47.705
happy Sera.
You won the last round.


768
00:57:47.749 --> 00:57:49.359
It means you
don t have to fight again.


769
00:57:49.403 --> 00:57:52.754
- Ahh!
- Adrian! Please!


770
00:57:52.797 --> 00:57:54.669
Oh yeah.

771
00:57:54.712 --> 00:57:57.019
Say my name Mira.

772
00:57:57.062 --> 00:57:59.389
But let me get my camera first.
I want to hear your screaming it


773
00:57:59.413 --> 00:58:02.372
over and over again.

774
00:58:04.722 --> 00:58:08.944
Right! A few more
minutes. Round two.


775
00:58:25.613 --> 00:58:28.833
Ah! Good! I hate it when
there s too much preamble.


776
00:58:28.877 --> 00:58:30.226
Straight to the action.

777
00:58:36.188 --> 00:58:37.799
Very artistic.

778
00:59:19.318 --> 00:59:23.932
No, no, no, no, no, no!
That was over too quickly!


779
00:59:27.414 --> 00:59:29.590
Fucking stupid bitch!

780
00:59:29.633 --> 00:59:32.680
Don t talk about her like
that, you pathetic little man.


781
00:59:32.723 --> 00:59:35.378
It s hilarious. You ve seen
what will happen yet when


782
00:59:35.422 --> 00:59:37.835
it s your turn, I bet you ll run
right into the electric fence.


783
00:59:37.859 --> 00:59:42.341
Why don t you come in this ring
and show us what you re made of.


784
00:59:42.385 --> 00:59:45.997
I ll fucking kill you. Ugh!

785
00:59:46.041 --> 00:59:49.479
Nice work Alice.
Very good technique.


786
00:59:49.523 --> 00:59:52.395
This wasn t her. It was you.

787
00:59:52.439 --> 00:59:54.658
This is my canvas

788
00:59:54.702 --> 00:59:57.226
and you girls are the...

789
00:59:57.269 --> 01:00:00.229
The brush.

790
01:00:00.272 --> 01:00:03.275
Get some sleep. You ve got
a long day ahead tomorrow.


791
01:00:19.640 --> 01:00:22.469
- Oh!
- It s ok, it s ok, it's ok.


792
01:00:22.512 --> 01:00:25.036
- My ribs!
- It s ok. It's ok.


793
01:00:26.473 --> 01:00:28.910
W-what happened?

794
01:00:28.953 --> 01:00:32.261
Why is there so much blood?

795
01:00:32.304 --> 01:00:34.437
It's ok.

796
01:00:34.481 --> 01:00:38.485
Please someone tell me what
happened. Whoever I fought,


797
01:00:38.528 --> 01:00:41.444
I'm sorry. I didn t
know what I was doing.


798
01:00:43.664 --> 01:00:47.319
Please! Mira, Ana, Joey, please?

799
01:00:48.930 --> 01:00:51.846
You didn t mean to.

800
01:00:51.889 --> 01:00:55.066
You, you didn t know
what you were doing.


801
01:00:55.110 --> 01:00:58.548
Alice, he s a psycho.

802
01:00:58.592 --> 01:01:00.158
Remember that.

803
01:01:00.202 --> 01:01:04.293
What the fuck do you
mean? I didn t mean to?


804
01:01:04.336 --> 01:01:06.904
I didn t mean to what?

805
01:01:06.948 --> 01:01:09.951
I'm so sorry Alice.

806
01:01:09.994 --> 01:01:14.216
It was Joey.

807
01:01:14.259 --> 01:01:18.263
She was exhausted. Uhh,
she didn t stand a chance.


808
01:01:18.307 --> 01:01:21.484
Sh-Sh-She s ok
though right? She s just hur...


809
01:01:21.528 --> 01:01:23.617
No you idiot!

810
01:01:23.660 --> 01:01:26.707
Jo
-Joey s dead, you killed her.

811
01:01:26.750 --> 01:01:27.751
Ana!

812
01:01:29.753 --> 01:01:33.148
It could have been any
of us. She didn t know what


813
01:01:33.191 --> 01:01:37.239
she was doing and...

814
01:01:37.282 --> 01:01:40.111
It could have
been me. I'm sorry.


815
01:01:40.155 --> 01:01:42.374
I had a part in it too.

816
01:01:42.418 --> 01:01:47.031
No, no, no, noooo

817
01:01:47.075 --> 01:01:51.209
Nooo, nooo. Noooo.

818
01:01:51.253 --> 01:01:53.124
Shhh.

819
01:02:05.397 --> 01:02:08.836
Shhh. Alice, Alice.

820
01:02:51.661 --> 01:02:53.445
Fuck.

821
01:02:53.489 --> 01:02:56.753
Hiya! How are you?

822
01:02:56.797 --> 01:02:59.800
Ooh! You re a bit dirty.
Been working on your car?


823
01:03:01.671 --> 01:03:04.848
Earth to Adrian.
Hello! You okay?


824
01:03:06.676 --> 01:03:08.460
What are you doing here?

825
01:03:08.504 --> 01:03:11.289
Well, it s nice to see you too!

826
01:03:11.333 --> 01:03:12.987
What do you mean,
what am I doing here?


827
01:03:13.030 --> 01:03:15.511
Photoshoot. Remember?

828
01:03:15.554 --> 01:03:17.382
What photoshoot?

829
01:03:17.426 --> 01:03:20.429
Seriously Adrian. I have just
had to walk half the way here


830
01:03:20.472 --> 01:03:23.171
The taxi couldn't get
through the fucking gate.


831
01:03:23.214 --> 01:03:26.217
Are you okay?
Is everything alright?


832
01:03:27.523 --> 01:03:30.787
Yeah, sorry I just, uh,
had a lot on my mind recently.


833
01:03:30.831 --> 01:03:32.484
What s this about a photoshoot?

834
01:03:35.096 --> 01:03:39.230
Photoshoot. You know,
you take pictures. I model.


835
01:03:39.274 --> 01:03:43.234
Booked in for today in
about like ten minutes time.


836
01:03:45.193 --> 01:03:47.804
No, I've not got anything
booked in for today. It s my um,


837
01:03:47.848 --> 01:03:50.372
birthday. I wouldn t
have booked anything in.


838
01:03:50.415 --> 01:03:52.722
No, no, no.
It s been booked for weeks.


839
01:03:52.766 --> 01:03:54.918
No, you must be mistaken.
I've got a lot planned for today


840
01:03:54.942 --> 01:03:57.335
'cause of my
birthday. You ll have to go.


841
01:03:57.379 --> 01:03:58.772
Are you absolutely sure?

842
01:03:58.815 --> 01:04:00.469
Positive.

843
01:04:00.512 --> 01:04:04.038
Ugh! What a waste of a day. You
know I've turned down a paid


844
01:04:04.081 --> 01:04:06.388
shoot for this right?

845
01:04:06.431 --> 01:04:08.564
Do you know what?

846
01:04:08.607 --> 01:04:12.220
Fine. But I am giving
you a very frowny review.


847
01:04:36.897 --> 01:04:39.551
Good morning ladies.

848
01:04:39.595 --> 01:04:41.118
Enough is enough Adrian.

849
01:04:41.162 --> 01:04:44.339
I decide when enough is enough.

850
01:04:44.382 --> 01:04:46.733
Let s all calm
down now, shall we.


851
01:04:51.563 --> 01:04:53.740
You were right Adrian.

852
01:04:56.307 --> 01:04:58.222
We just didn t
understand before.


853
01:05:00.964 --> 01:05:05.316
But we see you for
the genius you are now.


854
01:05:05.752 --> 01:05:07.884
Yeah.

855
01:05:07.928 --> 01:05:11.018
Fuck him and fuck this.

856
01:05:11.061 --> 01:05:13.237
Wake up Adrian.

857
01:05:13.281 --> 01:05:17.633
You re nobody and
you never will be.


858
01:05:17.676 --> 01:05:21.202
Hahaha. Fucking idiot.

859
01:05:21.245 --> 01:05:23.682
Let us out.

860
01:05:23.726 --> 01:05:27.643
We can help you. We
can tell everyone how amazing


861
01:05:27.686 --> 01:05:30.994
you are and help
promote your work.


862
01:05:31.038 --> 01:05:33.823
And we would love
to help you Adrian.


863
01:05:33.867 --> 01:05:36.826
Shut up!

864
01:05:36.870 --> 01:05:39.002
Do you think
I was born yesterday?


865
01:05:41.439 --> 01:05:43.354
Right. Don t go anywhere.

866
01:05:43.398 --> 01:05:46.140
I've got a little
surprise for round three.


867
01:05:46.183 --> 01:05:48.098
To show you that I'm serious.

868
01:05:53.887 --> 01:05:56.585
Well, what are we gonna
do now? He s never gonna let us


869
01:05:56.628 --> 01:05:57.934
out and we re
all gonna die here.


870
01:05:57.978 --> 01:06:01.503
Oh, come on! We can t
think like that okay?


871
01:06:01.546 --> 01:06:04.593
We need to be
strong and work together.


872
01:06:08.989 --> 01:06:10.686
Find a way out of these cages.

873
01:06:15.996 --> 01:06:17.824
Arghh!

874
01:06:17.867 --> 01:06:20.827
There s nothing. I'm never gonna
be able to get out of here.


875
01:06:24.004 --> 01:06:25.701
He s cable tied the whole thing.

876
01:06:25.744 --> 01:06:28.443
There s a locking
mechanism on the door.


877
01:06:30.097 --> 01:06:31.794
We re never getting out of here.

878
01:06:31.838 --> 01:06:32.839
Guys!

879
01:06:34.753 --> 01:06:37.756
I've got my
link free from my earring.


880
01:06:37.800 --> 01:06:40.759
I'm gonna try and pick it.

881
01:06:40.803 --> 01:06:41.891
- It s a long shot
- Do it!


882
01:06:41.935 --> 01:06:43.588
- Give it a go.
- Do it!


883
01:07:10.789 --> 01:07:11.790
Shit!

884
01:07:15.969 --> 01:07:18.885
Adrian.

885
01:07:18.928 --> 01:07:20.538
What is that?

886
01:07:21.757 --> 01:07:26.153
It s a gun. You know, you point
it at problems and they go away.


887
01:07:26.196 --> 01:07:27.415
Hahahaha.

888
01:07:32.724 --> 01:07:34.813
Nah, Adrian,
I double checked and it was


889
01:07:34.857 --> 01:07:36.554
definitely booked for today.

890
01:07:40.515 --> 01:07:41.690
What the fuck?

891
01:07:41.733 --> 01:07:45.476
Ah, I can see
you re busy though, umm...


892
01:07:45.520 --> 01:07:49.263
Run! Get the hell
out of here! Go! Run!


893
01:07:52.919 --> 01:07:55.486
I said I was busy
you stupid bitch!


894
01:07:58.663 --> 01:08:00.665
She was a frisky one wasn t she?

895
01:08:02.450 --> 01:08:06.410
In fact, let s add some
spice to the mix, shall we?

Look, we don t know how long
it s gonna be before we get out.


931
01:13:28.297 --> 01:13:31.605
We don t know how
long before he comes back.


932
01:13:31.648 --> 01:13:34.608
No, we re stronger as a team
Sera. Get me out of here, now.


933
01:13:34.651 --> 01:13:37.175
No, I will come

934
01:13:44.661 --> 01:13:45.662
Ah.

935

945
01:14:17.912 --> 01:14:20.218

Sera, now!

947
01:14:30.620 --> 01:14:32.448
You talking about
me behind my back?


948
01:14:32.492 --> 01:14:34.015
Don t flatter yourself.

949
01:14:34.058 --> 01:14:35.451
I thought you
might be a bit dry.


950
01:14:35.495 --> 01:14:37.671
All that champagne and drugs.

951
01:14:37.714 --> 01:14:40.717
Bad girls! Hahahahaha.

952
01:14:46.593 --> 01:14:48.943
Now we re not
playing around here.


953
01:14:48.986 --> 01:14:51.226
Bend your head back and I ll
pour it right in your mouth.


954
01:14:54.949 --> 01:14:55.950
Ooh.

955
01:15:02.696 --> 01:15:04.828
Uh, How do we know that's water?

956
01:15:06.264 --> 01:15:08.919
You ll just have to
trust me, won t you?


957
01:15:11.879 --> 01:15:12.943
I'm not entirely heartless.

958
01:15:12.967 --> 01:15:16.057
I'm not thirsty!

959
01:15:16.100 --> 01:15:17.363
Oh.

960
01:15:17.406 --> 01:15:19.582
Ahh! Fuck!

961
01:15:19.626 --> 01:15:21.473
If you get thirsty later
then you ve got some to lick up


962
01:15:21.497 --> 01:15:24.108
haven t you?

963
01:15:24.152 --> 01:15:26.415
Ha
-Hahahaha.

964
01:15:27.677 --> 01:15:30.376
I ll be back before bed
time to turn the lights out.


965
01:15:43.954 --> 01:15:45.782
Try again Sera!

966
01:15:45.826 --> 01:15:47.480
No!

967
01:15:47.523 --> 01:15:50.221
- Try again!
- Guys, I don t think she should.


968
01:15:50.265 --> 01:15:52.180
He came straight back in then.

969
01:15:52.223 --> 01:15:55.096
Look, we should wait
till night when he s asleep.


970
01:15:55.139 --> 01:15:58.055
And then what? He s
always in the fucking building.


971
01:15:58.099 --> 01:16:01.276
Apart from the large door
there s no way out of here.


972
01:16:01.319 --> 01:16:06.237
She s right. We have
not thought this through.


973
01:16:06.281 --> 01:16:08.892
I can t get the
electrics off that.


974
01:16:08.936 --> 01:16:11.329
He s gonna kill me.

975
01:16:11.373 --> 01:16:15.508
Look, I'm not good at
this motivational shit, okay?


976
01:16:15.551 --> 01:16:19.468
But you can do it Sera,
you re stronger than you look.


977
01:16:19.512 --> 01:16:22.036
You ve seen what
he s doing to us.


978
01:16:22.079 --> 01:16:25.431
Tomorrow will be just
one more nail in the coffin.


979
01:16:25.474 --> 01:16:27.694
Do it for the girls.

980
01:16:27.737 --> 01:16:30.436
As long as we re careful
and we think this through,


981
01:16:30.479 --> 01:16:33.700
then we ve got a
chance. Ana is right though.


982
01:16:35.832 --> 01:16:37.138
Yeah?

983
01:16:37.181 --> 01:16:38.922
Yeah.

984
01:16:38.966 --> 01:16:42.273
Then we just have to
wait for the right time.


985
01:16:42.317 --> 01:16:43.884
Yeah.

986
01:16:43.927 --> 01:16:46.408
Listen!

987
01:16:46.452 --> 01:16:47.646
He s getting ready for tomorrow.

988
01:16:47.670 --> 01:16:50.325
He s charging up
that fucking battery up.


989
01:16:53.067 --> 01:16:54.198
Wait!

990
01:16:56.853 --> 01:16:58.289
Is he leaving?

991
01:16:59.856 --> 01:17:02.642
He can t be leaving.

992
01:17:02.685 --> 01:17:04.687
No. He s definitely leaving!

993
01:17:04.731 --> 01:17:07.951
Sera this is our
chance. You can do it!


994
01:17:07.995 --> 01:17:09.953
Babe, you can do it, come on.

995
01:18:08.359 --> 01:18:09.360
Shit!

996
01:18:12.407 --> 01:18:14.322
Ugh! Oh!

997
01:19:21.519 --> 01:19:22.695
What the fuck?

998
01:19:27.787 --> 01:19:28.788
Hmm.

999
01:19:31.791 --> 01:19:33.444
Oh my god.

1000
01:19:41.496 --> 01:19:42.497
Mmm.

1001
01:19:45.500 --> 01:19:46.588
Okay.

1002
01:19:53.682 --> 01:19:54.857
Freak!

1003
01:20:11.961 --> 01:20:12.962
Shit!

1004
01:20:18.707 --> 01:20:22.145
Pump N Gro? You fucking...

1005
01:20:49.695 --> 01:20:50.783
Mmm.

1006
01:21:56.022 --> 01:21:58.067
What the fuck is going on?

1007
01:22:03.246 --> 01:22:05.901
I thought I told you girls to
behave. Honestly, I can t take


1008
01:22:05.945 --> 01:22:07.163
you anywhere.

1009
01:22:07.207 --> 01:22:10.819
We ve not done
anything. I can t sleep.


1010
01:22:10.863 --> 01:22:12.995
It smells and it s cramped.

1011
01:22:15.084 --> 01:22:17.608
Honestly, there is
no pleasing you, is there?


1012
01:22:17.652 --> 01:22:20.133
Oh, go to hell. You
know what? Get it over with.


1013
01:22:20.176 --> 01:22:21.874
Kill me already.

1014
01:22:21.917 --> 01:22:24.137
I'm so sorry, I should
have taken your feelings


1015
01:22:24.180 --> 01:22:25.355
into consideration.

1016
01:22:25.399 --> 01:22:26.879
You cunt!

1017
01:22:26.922 --> 01:22:29.751
Right! That is it, you re
going in. Forget your day off.


1018
01:22:34.800 --> 01:22:36.540
I managed to find
out how he s doing it.


1019
01:22:36.584 --> 01:22:37.846
- What is it?
- Ugh.


1020
01:22:37.890 --> 01:22:40.675
It s some kind
of muscle growth serum.


1021
01:22:40.718 --> 01:22:42.078
But that isn t
important right now.


1022
01:22:42.111 --> 01:22:43.547
I think it is.

1023
01:22:43.591 --> 01:22:46.159
No, listen.
I managed to reduce.


1024
01:22:50.772 --> 01:22:54.123
Hahaha. You know,

1025
01:22:54.167 --> 01:22:56.822
It s no surprise but I m
really gonna enjoy this.


1026
01:22:57.910 --> 01:23:01.304
Who are our contenders today
then? We have the jealous bitch.


1027
01:23:01.348 --> 01:23:02.349
Ahh!

1028
01:23:03.698 --> 01:23:05.091
And the prick tease.

1029
01:23:05.134 --> 01:23:06.353
Oh-ahh!

1030
01:23:09.922 --> 01:23:12.533
Here-we-go

1031
01:23:53.226 --> 01:23:54.531
Get on with it!

1032
01:24:17.511 --> 01:24:19.513
Come on!

1033
01:24:23.734 --> 01:24:25.388
- Ahh-ah!
- Ah!


1034
01:24:33.005 --> 01:24:34.006
Come on!

1035
01:24:44.842 --> 01:24:45.843
Come on!

1036
01:25:05.037 --> 01:25:06.212
Ugh!

1037
01:25:26.188 --> 01:25:27.842
- Ughh!
- Ughh!


1038
01:25:29.191 --> 01:25:31.193
Dirty girls! Hahahaha.

1039
01:25:39.506 --> 01:25:41.029
Ugh.

1040
01:25:57.480 --> 01:26:01.745
Mira, Mira, Mira. It s Ana.

1041
01:26:06.663 --> 01:26:09.623
Well, come on. You re
not tired already are you?


1042
01:26:09.666 --> 01:26:11.755
No stamina these days.

1043
01:26:11.799 --> 01:26:14.367
I ll have to up your
dosage next time. Ha.


1044
01:26:14.889 --> 01:26:17.022
Or are you just
saving it all for me?


1045
01:26:17.065 --> 01:26:18.762
Shhhh.

1046
01:26:18.806 --> 01:26:22.723
Adrian, Mira needs you.

1047
01:26:23.115 --> 01:26:24.551
No, no, no, no, no.

1048
01:26:27.858 --> 01:26:28.859
Stop it!

1049
01:26:31.775 --> 01:26:34.474
Play nicely.

1050
01:26:34.517 --> 01:26:36.432
Or what?

1051
01:26:36.476 --> 01:26:38.782
You asked for this.

1052
01:26:38.826 --> 01:26:40.934
- What are you doing?
- I never tried it on you, did I?


1053
01:26:40.958 --> 01:26:42.003
- Jealous bitch!
- Ugh!


1054
01:26:42.047 --> 01:26:43.048
Ohhh!

1055
01:26:51.143 --> 01:26:52.753
Awww.

1056
01:26:55.451 --> 01:26:58.237
I would ask you if
you ve got any last requests.


1057
01:26:58.280 --> 01:26:59.716
Fuck it!

1058
01:27:13.948 --> 01:27:15.210
So,

1059
01:27:15.254 --> 01:27:17.604
you wanna be remembered
for your artwork, huh?


1060
01:27:17.647 --> 01:27:18.647
Ahh!

1061
01:27:20.650 --> 01:27:21.651
Ahh.

1062
01:27:31.226 --> 01:27:33.402
Adrian s phone.

1063
01:27:33.446 --> 01:27:35.230
I can use it to
ring my step-dad.


1064
01:27:35.274 --> 01:27:36.623
Okay.

1065
01:27:40.061 --> 01:27:41.845
Ohhhh.

1066
01:27:41.889 --> 01:27:44.065
Gross! His keys, his keys.

1067
01:27:44.109 --> 01:27:47.112
Ohh-ohh. Ugh.

1068
01:27:48.678 --> 01:27:50.637
You keep the keys.

1069
01:27:50.680 --> 01:27:53.596
Yeah.

1070
01:27:53.640 --> 01:27:55.642
Ugh. No signal.

1071
01:27:56.860 --> 01:27:58.166
Oh nooo!

1072
01:27:58.210 --> 01:28:00.255
Come on, let s get out
of this fucking warehouse.


1073
01:28:00.299 --> 01:28:02.953
- Yeah. Ahaha.
- Let's go.


1074
01:28:07.871 --> 01:28:09.873
You re not the only one!

1075
01:28:11.701 --> 01:28:14.008
- Oh my god.
- Look,


1076
01:28:14.051 --> 01:28:17.098
I know I can come across
as a bit of a bitch sometimes.


1077
01:28:17.142 --> 01:28:18.621
SERA and MIRA:
Nooo.


1078
01:28:18.665 --> 01:28:20.928
- Shut up.
- Really? Ha!


1079
01:28:20.971 --> 01:28:24.758
Anyway! I know I can be a
bit of a bitch sometimes but


1080
01:28:24.801 --> 01:28:26.586
I'm forever grateful.

1081
01:28:26.629 --> 01:28:28.240
- Sure.
- Yeah, sure. Ahaha...


1082
01:28:28.283 --> 01:28:30.764
What? I thought it was
the kind of thing you d say


1083
01:28:30.807 --> 01:28:32.244
in this sort of situation.

1084
01:28:32.287 --> 01:28:33.941
Oh god!

1085
01:28:34.637 --> 01:28:36.161
Oh!

1086
01:28:36.204 --> 01:28:39.251
- Oh, shhhit.
- Just be yourself.


1087
01:28:39.294 --> 01:28:41.949
- Ohhh, woah.
- Thanks Mira.


1088
01:28:41.992 --> 01:28:45.213
- Daylight...
- Ohh-oh-ho!


1089
01:28:51.263 --> 01:28:54.222
- Oh-ho.
- Yes.


1090
01:28:54.266 --> 01:28:56.485
Our bags!

1091
01:28:56.529 --> 01:28:58.183
Bags, we need our bags!

1092
01:29:00.576 --> 01:29:02.970
Have I not taught you anything?

1093
01:29:03.013 --> 01:29:05.668
Uh.

1094
01:29:16.984 --> 01:29:18.333
LIAM Yeah, who s this?

1095
01:29:18.377 --> 01:29:20.988
- Liam, it s Mira!
- Mira?


1096
01:29:21.031 --> 01:29:23.208
Look, I've got no time to
explain. Can you please just


1097
01:29:23.251 --> 01:29:24.687
come and pick us up?

1098
01:29:24.731 --> 01:29:26.472
Mira, what s happened?

1099
01:29:26.515 --> 01:29:29.562
Yeah, I ll explain when
we re, when we're with you.


1100
01:29:29.605 --> 01:29:31.564
We? How many
of you are there?


1101
01:29:31.607 --> 01:29:33.218
There s two others.

1102
01:29:33.261 --> 01:29:36.308
Right! Oh, well tell me
exactly where to find you.


1103
01:29:36.351 --> 01:29:37.787
Yeah, I ll text
you the directions.


1104
01:29:37.831 --> 01:29:39.920
Yeah, now leaving.

1105
01:29:39.963 --> 01:29:41.095
Someone s coming?

1106
01:29:41.138 --> 01:29:42.749
Yeah, he s meeting
us just down the lane.


1107
01:31:07.486 --> 01:31:09.488
We re going for a drive.

1108
01:31:11.881 --> 01:31:13.840
For god s sake Cass.

1109
01:31:13.883 --> 01:31:16.233
Put some clothes on.
