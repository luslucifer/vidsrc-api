1
00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:25.982
My name is Captain James Tiberius Kirk.

2
00:01:26.076 --> 00:01:27.857
United Federation of Planets

3
00:01:28.473 --> 00:01:31.475
I'm appearing before you,
as a neutral representative ...


4
00:01:31.912 --> 00:01:33.508
Of the Fabonane Republic.

5
00:01:34.243 --> 00:01:35.857
And bring you a message of good will...

6
00:01:36.377 --> 00:01:37.041
And present to you ...

7
00:01:37.065 --> 00:01:39.065
Esteemed members of
the teenaxiene delegation ...


8
00:01:39.895 --> 00:01:42.562
A gift from the Fabonan High Council ...

9
00:01:42.586 --> 00:01:44.586
With the highest regard.

10
00:01:47.559 --> 00:01:48.991
What's wrong with it?

11
00:01:50.441 --> 00:01:52.887
- Excuse me?
- Why don't they want it anymore?


12
00:01:53.521 --> 00:01:54.446
Well...

13
00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:56.470
This was once a piece of
an ancient weapon ...


14
00:01:56.896 --> 00:01:59.301
And now they offer it
as a symbol, of ...

15
00:02:00.051 --> 00:02:00.903
Of peace.

16
00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:03.735
In the Fabonan culture
this surrendal weapon ...


17
00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:04.831
Is an offer of truth.

18
00:02:04.887 --> 00:02:06.074
How did they come by it ?

19
00:02:06.405 --> 00:02:08.877
They told me, they acquired it
long time ago.


20
00:02:09.006 --> 00:02:10.283
So they stole it, then!

21
00:02:11.445 --> 00:02:12.838
No ... they uhm ...

22
00:02:13.291 --> 00:02:13.663
Well ...

23
00:02:14.599 --> 00:02:17.015
You don't know the
Fabonan like we do !

24
00:02:17.078 --> 00:02:19.538
That's very true.
Your excellency, this gift ...


25
00:02:19.539 --> 00:02:22.264
They are crowds of
untrustworthy thieves ...


26
00:02:22.318 --> 00:02:24.895
Who wants to see us
murdered in our own base ...


27
00:02:24.961 --> 00:02:28.969
This beloved artifact is
a symbol of trust and peace.


28
00:02:28.994 --> 00:02:33.074
They will cut us into pieces,
and roast us over a fire ...


29
00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:34.084
I don't think that's true ...

30
00:02:34.109 --> 00:02:35.789
And eat us !

31
00:02:37.962 --> 00:02:38.759
What ?!

32
00:03:02.075 --> 00:03:04.141
Scotty ! Get me out of here !

33
00:03:04.355 --> 00:03:05.453
<i>Well, that was quick.</i>

34
00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:09.966
<i>There is quite a bit
a surface interference, sir.</i>


35
00:03:16.021 --> 00:03:16.899
Did it!

36
00:03:25.646 --> 00:03:27.425
I ripped my shirt again.

37
00:03:27.731 --> 00:03:28.476
How'd it go?

38
00:03:31.659 --> 00:03:34.049
Captain, did you manage to broke
a treaty with the Teenaxi ?


39
00:03:34.074 --> 00:03:35.344
Uhm...

40
00:03:35.369 --> 00:03:36.568
Let's just say we came out short.

41
00:03:36.593 --> 00:03:39.052
You look... lock that...

42
00:03:39.076 --> 00:03:41.076
In its personal vault, Spock.
Thank you.


43
00:03:41.296 --> 00:03:44.187
- Jim, you look like crap.
- Thank you, Bones.


44
00:03:44.272 --> 00:03:46.222
You have a little vein
popin out of your tremble again.


45
00:03:46.246 --> 00:03:47.348
You okay ?

46
00:03:47.349 --> 00:03:49.753
Never better.
It's just a another day in fleet.


47

<i>Captain's Log, 
Stardate 2263.2</i>

48
00:04:03.504 --> 00:04:07.933
<i>Today is our 966-day
in deep space.</i>


49
00:04:08.019 --> 00:04:10.656
<i>A little over 3 years of
our 5 year mission.</i>


50
00:04:13.259 --> 00:04:15.155
<i>More time you spend out here, ...</i>

51
00:04:15.444 --> 00:04:18.752
<i>The harder it is to tell where
one day ends ...</i>


52
00:04:19.322 --> 00:04:21.267
<i>And the next one begins.</i>

53
00:04:24.559 --> 00:04:26.542
<i>It can be a challenge
to feel grounded.</i>


54
00:04:27.149 --> 00:04:29.063
<i>When even gravity is artifical.</i>

55
00:04:30.284 --> 00:04:33.104
<i>But while we do what we can
to make it feel like home.</i>


56
00:04:36.815 --> 00:04:39.528
<i>The crew is always
continues to act admirably...</i>


57
00:04:39.553 --> 00:04:43.057
<i>Despite the rigors of our extended
stay here in outer space ...</i>


58
00:04:45.292 --> 00:04:47.612
<i>And the personal sacrifices they have made.</i>

59
00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:50.948
<i>We continue to search
for new life forms in order ...</i>


60
00:04:50.973 --> 00:04:53.442
<i>To establish firm diplomatic ties.</i>

61
00:04:54.342 --> 00:04:56.189
<i>Our extended time
in uncharted territories ...</i>


62
00:04:56.214 --> 00:04:58.681
<i>Stretched the ships mechanical
capacities ...</i>


63
00:04:58.706 --> 00:05:02.052
<i>But fortunately, our engineering
departement led by Mr.Scott ...</i>


64
00:05:02.077 --> 00:05:03.884
<i>Is more than up for the job.</i>

65
00:05:05.432 --> 00:05:08.838
<i>The ship aside,
prolonged cohabitation has ...</i>


66
00:05:09.036 --> 00:05:12.001
<i>Definitely ad effects on
interpersonal dynamics.</i>


67
00:05:13.388 --> 00:05:15.287
<i>Some experience is for better...</i>

68
00:05:16.781 --> 00:05:18.539
<i>And some for worse.</i>

69
00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:26.779
<i>As for me things
have started to feel ...</i>


70
00:05:27.116 --> 00:05:28.885
<i>A little episodic.</i>

71
00:05:30.129 --> 00:05:33.128
<i>The futher out we go,
the more I find myself wondering ...</i>


72
00:05:33.441 --> 00:05:35.468
<i>What is it we are trying to accomplish.</i>

73
00:05:36.178 --> 00:05:38.796
<i>If the universe is trully endless, then...</i>

74
00:05:39.378 --> 00:05:42.552
<i>If we're not striving
for something forever out of reach.</i>


75
00:05:44.268 --> 00:05:47.492
<i>The Enterprise is scheduled for
reprovisioning stop at Yorktown, ...</i>


76
00:05:47.925 --> 00:05:50.511
<i>Federation's newest and
most advanced starbase.</i>


77
00:05:51.255 --> 00:05:54.603
<i>Perhaps a break from routine
will offer us some rest, but ...</i>


78
00:05:54.628 --> 00:05:57.272
<i>Not from mysteries,
not the unknown.</i>


79
00:06:13.143 --> 00:06:14.338
Sorry, I'm late.

80
00:06:14.573 --> 00:06:17.653
Keenser's leaking some kind
hallious seed green gu ...


81
00:06:17.678 --> 00:06:20.302
And Scotty is terrified,
he's gonna sneeze on warp core ...


82
00:06:20.327 --> 00:06:21.170
And kill us all.

83
00:06:22.269 --> 00:06:23.653
What the hell are you drinking ?

84
00:06:24.843 --> 00:06:28.142
Pretty sure it's the rest of that
Saurian brandy we picked up on Thasus.


85
00:06:28.459 --> 00:06:30.844
My god man ! Are
you trying to go blind ?

86
00:06:31.272 --> 00:06:32.368
That stuff's illegal.

87
00:06:33.717 --> 00:06:35.321
Besides ...

88
00:06:35.723 --> 00:06:37.537
I found this in Chekov's locker.

89
00:06:38.604 --> 00:06:39.285
Wow !

90
00:06:39.318 --> 00:06:41.655
Right, I mean I always assumed
he would be vodka guy ...


91
00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:43.541
Vodka guy. Exactly.

92
00:06:43.659 --> 00:06:46.107
I wanted to have something
appropriate for your birthday.


93
00:06:47.208 --> 00:06:49.477
It's in couple days,
you know I don't care about that.


94
00:06:49.660 --> 00:06:50.457
I know.

95
00:06:50.481 --> 00:06:52.519
I know you don't like celebrating
it to on the day ...


96
00:06:52.544 --> 00:06:54.942
Because it's also the day
your poop bit the dust.


97
00:06:55.232 --> 00:06:56.040
I was being sensitive.

98
00:06:56.168 --> 00:06:59.578
Did they teach you about
better manner at medical school ?


99
00:07:00.514 --> 00:07:02.395
Or it's just a sudden charm?

100
00:07:13.248 --> 00:07:14.933
- Oh yeah.
- Ooh. That's good.


101
00:07:14.957 --> 00:07:16.158
Lordy.

102
00:07:19.164 --> 00:07:20.614
Are you gonna call your mom ?

103
00:07:21.012 --> 00:07:22.712
Yeah, of course I'll call on the day.

104
00:07:26.530 --> 00:07:28.340
I'm one year older.

105
00:07:29.395 --> 00:07:31.660
Yeah, that's usually how it works.

106
00:07:33.130 --> 00:07:35.448
A year older than
he ever got to be.

107
00:07:38.497 --> 00:07:40.196
He joined the Starfleet because he ...

108
00:07:41.890 --> 00:07:43.118
He believed in it.

109
00:07:45.835 --> 00:07:47.170
I joined on a dare.

110
00:07:48.345 --> 00:07:50.569
You joined and see if
you can live up to him.


111
00:07:51.950 --> 00:07:55.921
You've spent all this time,
trying to be George Kirk ...


112
00:07:56.230 --> 00:07:59.037
And now you're wondering just
what it means to be Jim.


113
00:07:59.742 --> 00:08:01.380
Why you're out here.

114
00:08:04.027 --> 00:08:07.518
To prove that aside
and a full head hair.

115
00:08:13.470 --> 00:08:14.879
- Kirk here.
- Captain.


116
00:08:15.131 --> 00:08:18.486
- Approaching Yorktown base.
- I'm on my way, Mr. Sulu.


117
00:08:19.995 --> 00:08:22.332
Let's keep this birthday thing
under wraps uhm.


118
00:08:22.811 --> 00:08:25.608
You know me.
Mr. Sensitive.


119
00:08:29.348 --> 00:08:32.300
Woaah,
that is impressive.


120
00:08:32.858 --> 00:08:35.093
Ay. She is a beauty, isn't she?

121
00:08:35.422 --> 00:08:37.819
What a damn monstrosity.

122
00:08:37.840 --> 00:08:39.976
Can't we just wrap
some space on a planet?

123
00:08:39.977 --> 00:08:43.040
Showing geographical favouritism
among conducted Federation worlds ...


124
00:08:43.065 --> 00:08:44.767
Could cause diplomatic tension.

125
00:08:44.805 --> 00:08:46.368
Oh, you don't think that looks tense ?

126
00:08:46.397 --> 00:08:49.720
Looks like a damn snow globe in space
just waiting to break.


127
00:08:50.865 --> 00:08:52.865
Ah, that's the spirit, Bones !

128
00:10:16.059 --> 00:10:17.202
Spock !

129
00:10:18.849 --> 00:10:20.500
Do you have a moment ?

130
00:10:21.347 --> 00:10:22.687
Of course, Nyota.

131
00:10:23.552 --> 00:10:25.647
I think you should have this back.

132
00:10:26.006 --> 00:10:27.497
It belonged to your mother.

133
00:10:27.498 --> 00:10:29.892
It is not in a vulcan custom ...

134
00:10:29.893 --> 00:10:33.168
To receive again that
which was given as a gift.


135
00:10:43.735 --> 00:10:45.198
You guys break up ?

136
00:10:46.929 --> 00:10:48.296
What did you do ?

137
00:10:48.816 --> 00:10:51.323
A typically reductive incourin out to.

138
00:10:52.536 --> 00:10:56.863
You know Spock,
if an Earth girl says : "it's me not you".


139
00:10:57.609 --> 00:10:59.116
It's definitely you.

140
00:11:04.352 --> 00:11:05.778
Excuse me.

141
00:11:05.882 --> 00:11:09.339
Commander Spock.
Will you have a minute of your time ?


142
00:11:33.588 --> 00:11:35.896
Thank you for bringing me this,
into my attention.


143
00:11:37.454 --> 00:11:39.248
Live long and prosper.

144

00:13:46.465 --> 00:13:48.793
Capable of navigating the nebula.

161
00:13:50.463 --> 00:13:54.748
You must have someone,
who can help us.


162
00:13:58.045 --> 00:14:01.826
We tracked her stranded ship
through the sector of uncharted nebula.


163
00:14:01.861 --> 00:14:04.560
Here. 210, mark 14.

164
00:14:06.045 --> 00:14:07.483
Long-range scan ?

165
00:14:07.869 --> 00:14:12.160
No data. The nebula is too dense.
It's uncharted space.


166
00:14:13.044 --> 00:14:16.122
Well, the Enterprise does have
the best navigational systems in the fleet.


167
00:14:17.082 --> 00:14:17.880
She can handle it.

168
00:14:17.905 --> 00:14:20.589
The only ship here,
with more advanced technology...


169
00:14:20.624 --> 00:14:22.611
Is still under construction.

170
00:14:23.409 --> 00:14:26.252
But it's not just a
ship that I am sending.

171
00:14:27.766 --> 00:14:29.024
I'll gather the crew.

172
00:14:29.466 --> 00:14:30.129
Captain.

173
00:14:31.077 --> 00:14:35.280
Starfleet Command sent me your application
for the vice-admiral position ...


174
00:14:35.305 --> 00:14:37.073
Here at this installation.

175
00:14:37.739 --> 00:14:38.652
Yes, ma'am.

176
00:14:41.637 --> 00:14:45.101
If I may, I would recommend
Commander Spock to...


177
00:14:45.126 --> 00:14:47.337
Replace me as
a Captain of the Enteprise.


178
00:14:47.964 --> 00:14:52.078
He is an exemplary Starfleet officer.
He'll make a great Captain.


179
00:14:53.675 --> 00:14:55.755
It isn't uncommon, you know.

180
00:14:56.529 --> 00:14:58.161
Even for a captain ...

181
00:14:58.185 --> 00:15:00.185
To want to leave.

182
00:15:00.781 --> 00:15:04.685
There's no relative direction
in the vastness of space ...


183
00:15:05.311 --> 00:15:07.362
There's only yourself.

184
00:15:07.967 --> 00:15:08.894
Your ship.

185
00:15:09.316 --> 00:15:10.346
Your crew.

186
00:15:11.825 --> 00:15:14.850
It's easier than you think to get lost.

187
00:15:15.309 --> 00:15:17.291
-It's not ...
-I'll bring it up with the General Council.


188
00:15:17.316 --> 00:15:19.076
We'll discuss it, when you return.

189
00:15:20.638 --> 00:15:21.256
Mam.

190
00:15:31.961 --> 00:15:33.982
- Mr. Spock.
- Captain.


191
00:15:36.048 --> 00:15:37.222
- I have something ...
- Perhaps there ...


192
00:15:38.545 --> 00:15:40.692
- No, please.
- Captain, after you.


193
00:15:41.020 --> 00:15:42.212
I insist.

194
00:15:43.819 --> 00:15:45.490
After this mission, we should ...

195
00:15:45.515 --> 00:15:46.621
We should sit down.

196
00:15:46.645 --> 00:15:48.498
There is something
I need to talk you about.


197
00:15:48.523 --> 00:15:50.402
I, as well, have something to share.

198
00:15:56.751 --> 00:15:58.576
We make a good team, right ?

199
00:16:00.955 --> 00:16:02.314
I believe we do.

200
00:16:06.627 --> 00:16:07.940
I insist.

201
00:16:28.049 --> 00:16:29.913
Lt. Uhura, open a ship wide channel.

202
00:16:29.919 --> 00:16:30.943
Yes, Captain.

203
00:16:34.043 --> 00:16:36.071
Attention, crew of the Enterprise.

204
00:16:36.764 --> 00:16:39.271
Our mission is straightforward.

205
00:16:39.726 --> 00:16:43.280
The rescue of a crew stranded
on a planet in uncharted space.


206
00:16:43.672 --> 00:16:46.782
Our trajectory will take us through
an unstable nebula ...


207
00:16:46.807 --> 00:16:50.507
One which will disable
all communication with Starfleet.


208
00:16:51.802 --> 00:16:53.239
We're gonna on our own.

209
00:16:53.791 --> 00:16:56.987
The Enteprise has something no other ship
in the fleet has.


210
00:16:57.777 --> 00:16:59.051
You.

211
00:17:00.020 --> 00:17:03.746
As we come to understand
there's no such things, the unknown.


212
00:17:05.856 --> 00:17:07.682
We'll be temporarily hidden.

213
00:17:08.379 --> 00:17:09.379
Kirk out.

214
00:17:29.688 --> 00:17:33.110
Readings indicate
cloud density deminishing, sir.


215
00:17:44.909 --> 00:17:47.676
This is Altamid.
My ship is stranded here.


216
00:18:02.699 --> 00:18:04.879
Approaching Altamid.

217
00:18:04.946 --> 00:18:06.585
Class M planet.

218
00:18:07.239 --> 00:18:11.232
Massive subterranean development but
limited to no life forms on the surface.


219
00:18:11.467 --> 00:18:12.643
Proximity alert, sir.

220
00:18:12.678 --> 00:18:14.752
We have an unknown
ship heading right on us.

221
00:18:14.777 --> 00:18:16.319
- Lt. Uhura, hail them.
- Yes, Captain.


222
00:18:22.645 --> 00:18:23.718
No response.

223
00:18:24.079 --> 00:18:25.880
I'm picking up some kind of a signal.

224
00:18:29.760 --> 00:18:31.023
They are jamming us.

225
00:18:31.493 --> 00:18:33.488
Magnify, Mr. Sulu.

226
00:18:39.435 --> 00:18:40.819
What is this ?

227
00:18:44.431 --> 00:18:46.110
Shields up ! Red alert !

228
00:18:52.211 --> 00:18:53.923
Fire at will !

229
00:19:01.236 --> 00:19:03.348
Sir, our phasers are
having minimal effect ...


230
00:19:03.373 --> 00:19:05.388
And our torpedoes can't
track their movements.


231
00:19:05.768 --> 00:19:07.225
Fire everything we've got.

232
00:19:07.250 --> 00:19:09.486
Captain, we are not equipped
for this matteral engadgement.


233
00:19:20.805 --> 00:19:22.753
Shields frequency has no effect, sir.

234
00:19:22.778 --> 00:19:23.878
They took out the DITCH.

235
00:19:23.879 --> 00:19:25.311
Shields are inoperable.

236
00:19:27.329 --> 00:19:29.256
- Warp us out of here, Mr. Sulu.
- Yes, sir.


237
00:19:37.173 --> 00:19:40.103
- Why the hell aren't we moving?
- I can not engage the warp drive, sir.


238
00:19:44.700 --> 00:19:46.634
Scotty, I need warp now.

239
00:19:48.866 --> 00:19:50.944
I can not, sir.

240
00:19:59.139 --> 00:20:00.634
They are gone.

241
00:20:01.423 --> 00:20:04.207
Security, engage
all emergency procedures.


242
00:20:06.742 --> 00:20:08.875
All personnel to emergency stations.

243
00:20:31.973 --> 00:20:34.830
I have hull breaches
in levels 12 to 15,

244
00:20:34.929 --> 00:20:38.308
6, 9, 31 and 21, sir.

245
00:20:38.333 --> 00:20:42.064
Captain, it's a 10 sec to reroute
the energy residual from the warp core ...


246
00:20:42.089 --> 00:20:43.394
To the impulse engines.

247
00:20:43.616 --> 00:20:45.748
If we can get back into the nebula
maybe we can lose them.


248
00:20:45.773 --> 00:20:47.252
Do whatever you have to, Scotty.

249
00:20:47.737 --> 00:20:48.633
Keenser !

250
00:20:49.117 --> 00:20:49.928
Let's go !

251
00:21:15.299 --> 00:21:16.753
All clear, krall.

252
00:21:59.741 --> 00:22:02.553
Connecting plasma pipes,
stand by then you start it on my mark!


253
00:22:16.720 --> 00:22:21.208
I have the Abronath.
Secure the ship.


254
00:22:26.354 --> 00:22:27.517
- Captain.
- Go, Spock.


255
00:22:27.529 --> 00:22:30.940
I've identified the individual intruder
and leading the attack party.


256
00:22:31.405 --> 00:22:33.732
They infiltrated the archive vault,
and removed the artifact ...


257
00:22:33.771 --> 00:22:34.945
From our mission on Teenax.

258
00:22:35.001 --> 00:22:36.322
Hold your distance until ...

259
00:22:37.264 --> 00:22:39.101
Spock ! Spock !

260
00:22:40.388 --> 00:22:42.218
You two, with me.
Sulu, you have the cod.


261
00:22:42.219 --> 00:22:43.319
Yes, sir.

262
00:23:06.312 --> 00:23:07.607
My god !

263
00:23:11.392 --> 00:23:12.656
The hell ?

264
00:23:17.089 --> 00:23:18.201
Doctor ?!

265
00:23:20.621 --> 00:23:22.461
Doctor, we must evacuate now !

266
00:23:58.344 --> 00:24:00.739
Captain ...

267
00:24:00.963 --> 00:24:02.234
Kirk.

268
00:24:20.806 --> 00:24:22.979
Yes!
We have 100% impulse.


269
00:24:23.172 --> 00:24:24.566
Great work, Mr. Scott !

270
00:24:24.591 --> 00:24:26.495
Maximum impulse towards the nebula !

271
00:24:26.520 --> 00:24:27.315
Ay!

272
00:24:45.080 --> 00:24:47.066
Krall, the ship runs into the nebula.

273
00:24:49.058 --> 00:24:51.052
Cut its throat.

274
00:25:57.199 --> 00:25:58.811
Kirk to bridge !

275
00:25:59.456 --> 00:26:01.822
We are losing the innertial dampers.

276
00:26:01.823 --> 00:26:03.848
Systems are failing shipway,
Captain.


277
00:26:04.182 --> 00:26:05.646
The emergency blockades are sealing ...

278
00:26:05.647 --> 00:26:08.916
But the structural integrity
is at 18% and falling, sir.


279
00:26:09.859 --> 00:26:11.974
Abandon ship, Mr. Sulu.

280
00:26:14.163 --> 00:26:15.507
Sound the alarm.

281
00:26:21.583 --> 00:26:23.590
We need to give those pods
a chance to escape.


282
00:26:23.635 --> 00:26:25.224
Can you lead the ship away ?

283
00:26:25.249 --> 00:26:28.129
Impulse engines are still trying
to draw power from the warp reserve.


284
00:26:28.154 --> 00:26:31.454
We can not move until
the SAUCER is separated.


285
00:26:32.336 --> 00:26:33.704
I'll handle it.

286
00:26:34.012 --> 00:26:34.977
Ay ay, sir.

287
00:26:48.417 --> 00:26:51.135
We got to get you
guys to escape pod. Go.

288
00:26:51.190 --> 00:26:52.374
Ensign. Syl.

289
00:26:54.454 --> 00:26:55.870
I need your help.

290
00:26:56.585 --> 00:26:57.786
Yes, sir.

291
00:27:29.030 --> 00:27:30.290
My god!

292
00:27:30.723 --> 00:27:32.418
Spock, they are taking the crew.

293
00:28:08.955 --> 00:28:09.785
Are you okay?

294
00:28:09.810 --> 00:28:10.967
SAUCER should be free by now.

295
00:28:10.992 --> 00:28:13.698
I know, Mr. Sulu.
The Captain should be there.


296
00:29:39.295 --> 00:29:41.047
<i>SAUCER SEPARATION</i>

297
00:30:05.775 --> 00:30:09.047
The impulse engines
drawing power from auxiliary generators.


298
00:30:18.970 --> 00:30:19.982
Captain.

299
00:30:22.951 --> 00:30:25.003
How many of the crew
are still pod disposal ?


300
00:30:26.594 --> 00:30:27.453
None.

301
00:30:28.126 --> 00:30:29.521
But if I'm reading this correctly ...

302
00:30:30.454 --> 00:30:31.942
The intruders are taking them.

303
00:30:32.179 --> 00:30:34.727
Captain, we're caught
in the planet's gravity.


304
00:30:34.752 --> 00:30:37.301
We can not pull away.

305
00:30:41.924 --> 00:30:43.615
Get your captain pods.

306
00:30:44.064 --> 00:30:45.645
- Yes, sir.
- Ay, Captain.


307
00:30:45.680 --> 00:30:46.904
Come on! Let's go!

308
00:33:25.599 --> 00:33:26.599
You knew...

309
00:33:26.624 --> 00:33:28.403
You knew we would be attacked.

310
00:33:28.729 --> 00:33:29.982
You don't understand.

311
00:33:30.911 --> 00:33:32.077
Captain Kirk.

312
00:33:38.376 --> 00:33:40.640
Yes, I lied.

313
00:33:42.051 --> 00:33:44.640
Our ship was attacked.

314
00:33:46.211 --> 00:33:48.283
Chekov, check your comms for survivors.

315
00:33:48.318 --> 00:33:49.607
Ay ay, ay Captain.

316
00:33:49.642 --> 00:33:52.385
- Who is he?
- His name is Krall.


317
00:33:53.897 --> 00:33:57.327
He took my crew,
like he took yours.


318
00:33:57.401 --> 00:33:59.277
How did he know so much
about the Enterprise?


319
00:34:00.125 --> 00:34:02.829
All I know is that
if I did this ...

320
00:34:04.753 --> 00:34:06.727
He'll set them free.

321
00:34:06.959 --> 00:34:09.575
Chekov, are you picking
anything upon those scanners ?


322
00:34:10.976 --> 00:34:12.415
Nothing sir.

323
00:34:13.801 --> 00:34:15.966
- What if they...
- No, no.


324
00:34:17.043 --> 00:34:18.406
He was taking them.

325
00:34:18.694 --> 00:34:20.551
We have to find that SAUCER even

326
00:34:20.586 --> 00:34:23.325
minimal scanning systems
will have more range than a tricorder.


327
00:34:23.350 --> 00:34:25.577
Ay, Captain. It's possible.

328
00:34:26.181 --> 00:34:30.322
Captain, I was protecting my crew.

329
00:35:30.163 --> 00:35:32.428
What is your name?

330
00:35:34.754 --> 00:35:36.433
How do you know our language?

331
00:35:36.899 --> 00:35:39.492
I know your kind.

332
00:35:40.921 --> 00:35:43.900
I'm Lt. Nyota Uhura
of the USS Enteprise.


333
00:35:44.147 --> 00:35:46.695
And you have committed an
act of war against Fede...

334
00:35:46.730 --> 00:35:48.540
Federation.

335
00:35:50.149 --> 00:35:53.296
Federation is an act of war.

336
00:35:53.649 --> 00:35:56.039
You've attacked us.

337
00:36:00.195 --> 00:36:02.268
Your captain...

338
00:36:03.236 --> 00:36:07.443
Why did you sacrifice yourself for him?

339
00:36:07.488 --> 00:36:08.849
He would have done the same.

340
00:36:09.637 --> 00:36:12.700
And if he made it off that ship,
he will come for us.


341
00:36:14.158 --> 00:36:19.325
I'm counting on it, Lt. Uhura.

342
00:36:48.061 --> 00:36:49.716
I can't believe it.

343
00:36:59.845 --> 00:37:01.065
My god, Spock!

344
00:37:05.545 --> 00:37:06.845
Sit down over here.

345
00:37:08.756 --> 00:37:10.224
Okay, easy, easy.

346
00:37:15.575 --> 00:37:16.807
I'll just a...

347
00:37:17.070 --> 00:37:18.666
Try to relax.
Your're going to be okay.


348
00:37:18.691 --> 00:37:20.562
Forced optimism in your voice suggests ...

349
00:37:20.563 --> 00:37:22.912
You are trying to enlist
essensive calm in order ...


350
00:37:22.913 --> 00:37:23.833
Cut the horse shit.

351
00:37:23.858 --> 00:37:24.503
Doctor.

352
00:37:24.527 --> 00:37:27.129
I failed to see how excrement of any kind
feels relevant ...


353
00:37:27.154 --> 00:37:28.692
In our current situation.

354
00:37:29.293 --> 00:37:31.212
- What the hell are you doing?
- We must keep moving, doctor.


355
00:37:31.237 --> 00:37:33.270
Spock, this thing punched your
iliac region.


356
00:37:33.295 --> 00:37:35.835
- Time is a critical factor.
- That's exactly what I am trying to tell you.


357
00:37:35.860 --> 00:37:38.001
Look, I can't take this out.
You are gonna die.


358
00:37:38.026 --> 00:37:41.146
Okay, if I take it out and can't stop
the bleeding, you are gonna die.


359
00:37:41.171 --> 00:37:43.325
I can't see no appealing neither option.

360
00:37:43.350 --> 00:37:46.018
Believe me or not,
neither can I.


361
00:37:46.794 --> 00:37:49.890
So, if I remember correctly

362
00:37:50.828 --> 00:37:55.366
You got vulcans of your hearts,
where humans have their livers.


363
00:37:55.391 --> 00:37:57.159
That is correct, doctor.

364
00:37:57.743 --> 00:37:59.471
That explains some thing or two.

365
00:38:02.285 --> 00:38:05.306
You know, you are lucky.
An inch to the left...


366
00:38:07.693 --> 00:38:09.188
And you would be dead already.

367
00:38:10.593 --> 00:38:12.065
I just don't get it, Spock.

368
00:38:13.854 --> 00:38:16.107
What did they attack us for?
I mean...


369
00:38:16.946 --> 00:38:21.076
They do all this for some
<i>duedad</i> with the tiny clevers didn't want ?


370
00:38:21.101 --> 00:38:24.954
It is unwise to trivialize that which
one simply does not understand, Doctor.


371
00:38:25.355 --> 00:38:28.306
We can safely assume that
it's more important than a <i>duedad</i>.


372
00:38:29.139 --> 00:38:31.425
I think you just managed
to insult me twice, Spock.


373
00:38:40.539 --> 00:38:41.664
Alright, Spock.

374
00:38:41.762 --> 00:38:43.635
Just got one question.

375
00:38:43.736 --> 00:38:46.324
- What's your favorite color?
- I failed to see the relevance...


376
00:38:51.701 --> 00:38:54.105
Yeah, they say it hurts less
if it's a surprise.


377
00:38:55.366 --> 00:38:57.736
I made a doctor parlance
with which you are familiar...


378
00:38:57.771 --> 00:39:01.374
I can confirm your
theory to be horse shit.

379
00:39:04.772 --> 00:39:06.061
We gotta get out of here.

380
00:39:37.710 --> 00:39:39.447
You're kidding me, aren't you?

381
00:39:44.596 --> 00:39:45.633
Hello there.

382
00:39:46.285 --> 00:39:48.462
My name is Montgomery Scott... and...

383
00:39:48.992 --> 00:39:50.356
Who might you be ?

384
00:39:52.106 --> 00:39:55.277
Watch it sonny, I am pretty handy
when I want to be ... right.


385
00:40:40.859 --> 00:40:42.371
No come back.

386
00:40:43.302 --> 00:40:45.090
Well, we surely ???????? Lassy

387
00:40:46.328 --> 00:40:48.618
That's Starfleet property ...
You can not just ...


388
00:40:48.619 --> 00:40:51.283
But, I'm feeling generous today
so have at it.


389
00:40:52.798 --> 00:40:54.051
Where did you get that?

390
00:40:54.306 --> 00:40:55.901
- Is that English?
- I learned it from my house.


391
00:40:55.925 --> 00:40:56.950
Where did you get that ?

392
00:40:56.951 --> 00:40:59.416
- This is my Starfleet insignia.
- What does it mean ?


393
00:40:59.517 --> 00:41:02.851
Means that I am an officer of a Starfleet's
engineering division.


394
00:41:04.602 --> 00:41:06.719
- Engineering?
- Ay yes, I fix things.


395
00:41:06.720 --> 00:41:08.768
I know what is engineering.

396
00:41:10.557 --> 00:41:13.172
You're not with those bastards
who killed my ship are ya?


397
00:41:14.733 --> 00:41:15.845
I take that as a no.

398
00:41:18.073 --> 00:41:20.415
He is Krall. Him and his...

399
00:41:21.741 --> 00:41:22.862
...bees.

400
00:41:22.863 --> 00:41:25.182
They searched the stars for ya.
Death machine.


401
00:41:25.403 --> 00:41:28.451
They are the reason why you are here,
why we are all here.


402
00:41:29.209 --> 00:41:30.838
Even those 3 scunners ?

403
00:41:32.167 --> 00:41:34.671
They have fallen from the sky,
like me and you.


404
00:41:37.340 --> 00:41:39.116
Come with me. Now !

405
00:41:39.644 --> 00:41:42.214
Wait, hang on a minute Lassy.
I am in a difficult day here.


406
00:41:43.088 --> 00:41:44.940
I gotta fing my crewmates.

407
00:41:46.142 --> 00:41:48.197
I will help you find your mates...

408
00:41:48.360 --> 00:41:50.053
...and then you will help me.

409
00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:52.254
With what?

410
00:41:53.578 --> 00:41:55.563
- You want me to fix something?
- Yes.


411
00:41:55.669 --> 00:41:57.290
You help me and I help you.

412
00:41:59.048 --> 00:42:01.582
Alright, well things have been nasty all day,
and I won't get better offer today.


413
00:42:01.676 --> 00:42:02.905
So lead the way.

414
00:42:02.930 --> 00:42:03.957
Good.

415
00:42:04.325 --> 00:42:05.524
I am Jaylah.

416
00:42:06.094 --> 00:42:08.732
- And you're Montgomery Scott.
- Ay, Scotty.


417
00:42:09.997 --> 00:42:12.384
Come now, Montgomery Scotty.

418
00:42:14.413 --> 00:42:15.501
Alright, hold on.

419
00:42:32.317 --> 00:42:34.398
The Enterprise.

420
00:42:34.749 --> 00:42:39.210
It may not even have power
to the bridge, Captain.


421
00:42:42.153 --> 00:42:44.929
She still has a
few tricks up her sleeve.

422
00:42:46.817 --> 00:42:48.361
I bet on it.

423
00:42:50.488 --> 00:42:52.336
McCoy to Enterprise, come in.

424
00:42:53.418 --> 00:42:55.011
McCoy to Enterprise.

425
00:42:57.946 --> 00:43:01.175
Hey, take it easy there, Spock.
That was just a temporary fix back there.


426
00:43:01.200 --> 00:43:03.104
I understand, Doctor.

427
00:43:09.080 --> 00:43:10.365
Fascinating.

428
00:43:10.494 --> 00:43:12.546
Omuns, dark, dangerous.

429
00:43:16.133 --> 00:43:17.492
We are going in.

430
00:43:38.556 --> 00:43:39.524
Intriguing.

431
00:43:39.549 --> 00:43:43.674
These symbols are the same as those that we
picked on the artifact taken in the attack.


432
00:43:43.709 --> 00:43:44.922
You think it came from here ?

433
00:43:46.336 --> 00:43:47.996
It would seem so.

434
00:43:51.994 --> 00:43:53.316
Damm it ... Spock !

435
00:44:03.142 --> 00:44:04.142
Hurry.

436
00:44:05.226 --> 00:44:07.782
- Aren't we there yet?
- Stop asking that.


437
00:44:07.993 --> 00:44:10.463
- Sorry.
- This is the way, come.


438
00:44:11.785 --> 00:44:14.730
Watch your steps,
you do not want to set up my traps.


439
00:44:16.782 --> 00:44:18.782
Oh, that's clever.

440
00:44:20.207 --> 00:44:21.926
What is this place?

441
00:44:22.207 --> 00:44:24.857
- This is my house.
- Your house ?


442
00:44:26.778 --> 00:44:27.901
Is this a ship?

443
00:44:27.993 --> 00:44:30.921
I hope you find your friends
and you help me fix it.


444
00:44:31.513 --> 00:44:33.691
So I can leave this planet forever.

445
00:44:34.813 --> 00:44:36.097
Wo... Wait a minute.

446
00:44:36.365 --> 00:44:37.683
Is this your ship?

447
00:44:38.037 --> 00:44:40.044
No, Montgomery Scotty.

448
00:44:41.980 --> 00:44:43.804
It's yours.

449
00:44:44.628 --> 00:44:46.628
Oh my good lord.

450
00:44:46.652 --> 00:44:50.037
<i>U.S.S Franklin</i>

451
00:44:53.866 --> 00:44:56.330
Captain, it looks like there is power.

452
00:44:56.861 --> 00:44:59.911
Alright, let's get to the bridge
and find the crew.


453
00:45:40.955 --> 00:45:43.299
The console is intacted, and I will ...

454
00:45:44.076 --> 00:45:45.633
Try to reroute power to it.

455
00:45:46.429 --> 00:45:47.446
Work fast.

456
00:45:47.524 --> 00:45:50.598
Once we get this place run,
we are gonna draw a lot of attention.


457
00:45:52.119 --> 00:45:53.561
What do you think ? 
You can find them ?

458
00:45:53.590 --> 00:45:54.518
Ay, Captain.

459
00:45:54.593 --> 00:45:58.223
I am reconfiguring scanners
to modulate for the crews sequence.


460
00:46:02.155 --> 00:46:05.050
You with me.
I left something behind.


461
00:46:16.936 --> 00:46:18.248
That is one heck of a cold.

462
00:46:18.299 --> 00:46:19.863
Nice job, Keenser.

463
00:46:21.910 --> 00:46:24.509
Alright, we got about 15 minutes
until the next guard rotation.


464
00:46:24.694 --> 00:46:25.750
Come on.

465
00:46:33.159 --> 00:46:34.324
Let's go, go.

466
00:46:41.128 --> 00:46:42.076
Come on !

467
00:46:50.495 --> 00:46:52.166
This is a Magellan probe.

468
00:46:53.019 --> 00:46:55.791
Federation is using these to
find a way through the nebula.


469
00:46:56.577 --> 00:46:58.284
What it is using it for ?

470
00:47:26.521 --> 00:47:27.363
What do you see?

471
00:47:30.705 --> 00:47:33.809
He's been pinging back in a subspace
links between the probes.


472
00:47:34.724 --> 00:47:36.742
Well, use it to send a distress signal.

473
00:47:37.727 --> 00:47:38.974
I can try.

474
00:47:43.861 --> 00:47:44.930
Sent.

475
00:47:45.058 --> 00:47:46.923
He has access to Yorktown database.

476
00:47:47.677 --> 00:47:48.396
What ?

477
00:47:49.458 --> 00:47:52.176
That's Startfleet datafiles ...
Ship logs ...


478
00:47:52.900 --> 00:47:54.900
Including the Enterprise.

479
00:47:56.001 --> 00:47:58.248
He's been watching us this whole time.

480
00:48:13.676 --> 00:48:15.086
Captain ...

481
00:48:15.701 --> 00:48:17.873
The artifact was on the ship
the whole time ?


482
00:48:18.749 --> 00:48:20.713
I cannot afford to get caught with it.

483
00:48:20.738 --> 00:48:22.422
So I hid it in here.

484
00:48:28.128 --> 00:48:31.415
Tell Krall ... 
I have the Abronath.

485
00:48:32.870 --> 00:48:35.353
Do you really have
my sad story you hear ?


486
00:48:37.879 --> 00:48:39.239
Not every.

487
00:48:39.859 --> 00:48:43.474
Put the phaser down. Please.

488
00:48:47.545 --> 00:48:49.165
You get it, Chekov ?

489
00:48:49.424 --> 00:48:50.148
Ay, Captain.

490
00:48:50.172 --> 00:48:52.403
I've traced the
location of her comm.


491
00:48:58.873 --> 00:49:00.733
What does Krall want with this thing ?

492
00:49:01.942 --> 00:49:03.872
To save you.

493
00:49:04.273 --> 00:49:05.872
From yourselves.

494
00:49:05.873 --> 00:49:06.873
Captain !

495
00:49:51.583 --> 00:49:54.943
- You all right ?
- Ay, Captain, but we are trapped.


496
00:50:05.517 --> 00:50:06.879
Can you get this thing started?

497
00:50:06.904 --> 00:50:09.774
Are you intending inition ...
Engage the thrusters ?


498
00:50:09.799 --> 00:50:11.418
I am open up for suggestions.

499
00:50:11.443 --> 00:50:12.490
Okay.

500
00:50:15.891 --> 00:50:17.497
- There's the problem, sir.
- What?


501
00:50:17.543 --> 00:50:20.109
It's the pipe.
I can not init to combust.


502
00:50:21.348 --> 00:50:24.326
Captain, we are basically
standing on a very large bomb.


503
00:50:24.332 --> 00:50:25.800
If you miss the combustion compressor.

504
00:50:25.812 --> 00:50:26.923
I am not gonna miss, come on.

505
00:50:27.013 --> 00:50:28.948
Do you even know what
the compressor looks like ?


506
00:50:29.163 --> 00:50:30.439
As squared, right ?

507
00:50:30.524 --> 00:50:32.258
No, sir ! It's round ...

508
00:50:32.325 --> 00:50:33.858
That's what I said.

509
00:51:22.736 --> 00:51:23.756
Chekov !

510
00:51:57.265 --> 00:51:59.812
Chekov, move !

511
00:52:57.209 --> 00:52:59.600
You think you know ...

512
00:52:59.635 --> 00:53:04.234
What sacrifice really means ?

513
00:53:07.461 --> 00:53:10.040
Federation has thought you ...

514
00:53:10.075 --> 00:53:13.370
That conflict should not exist !

515
00:53:19.223 --> 00:53:21.586
But without stronger, ...

516
00:53:22.629 --> 00:53:26.799
You'll never know who you trully are.

517
00:53:27.287 --> 00:53:28.884
You have no idea who we are.

518
00:53:30.489 --> 00:53:32.524
But you'll soon find out.

519
00:53:32.814 --> 00:53:37.246
You mean the distress signal
you thought you sent ?


520
00:53:40.369 --> 00:53:42.659
The coordinates were altered.

521
00:53:43.777 --> 00:53:46.690
Your rescue ships
will be stranded in the nebula ...


522
00:53:46.691 --> 00:53:49.834
And your base left, full open.

523
00:53:51.391 --> 00:53:53.239
You go to attack Yorktown.

524
00:53:53.540 --> 00:53:57.446
Millions of souls from every
Federation world ...


525
00:53:57.447 --> 00:53:59.180
Holding hands.

526
00:54:00.006 --> 00:54:02.006
It's a perfect target.

527
00:54:02.032 --> 00:54:03.694
You are wrong.

528
00:54:03.719 --> 00:54:05.719
There is strength in unity.

529
00:54:10.629 --> 00:54:13.903
The strength of others... Lte. ...

530
00:54:14.225 --> 00:54:17.650
Is what has kept me alive.

531
00:54:17.687 --> 00:54:19.551
No !

532
00:54:43.777 --> 00:54:44.777
Spock!

533
00:54:45.802 --> 00:54:47.215
Spock, wake up damn it !

534
00:54:50.596 --> 00:54:52.578
I am entirely conscious, doctor.

535
00:54:53.459 --> 00:54:55.978
I am simply contemplating
the nature of mortality.


536
00:54:57.555 --> 00:54:59.328
You feel philosophical, huh ?

537
00:55:01.587 --> 00:55:03.859
You have mass blood loss into that tria.

538
00:55:06.679 --> 00:55:10.070
You asked me why Lt. Uhura
and I parted ways.


539
00:55:11.603 --> 00:55:13.687
I became concerned ...

540
00:55:13.711 --> 00:55:15.687
In the light of Vulcans demise ...

541
00:55:15.788 --> 00:55:18.255
And would have had
a duty to my species.

542
00:55:20.135 --> 00:55:22.662
You thought you should be off
making little vulcans, huh ?


543
00:55:24.701 --> 00:55:27.339
Yup, I can see how that'd upset her.

544
00:55:28.458 --> 00:55:30.323
I intended to discuss it
with her further ...


545
00:55:30.358 --> 00:55:33.623
But I received some news which
affected me unexpectedly.


546
00:55:36.027 --> 00:55:37.492
What news ?

547
00:55:39.101 --> 00:55:41.241
Ambassador Spock is dead.

548
00:55:45.651 --> 00:55:47.435
Spock, I'm so sorry.

549
00:55:50.959 --> 00:55:54.347
I can not imagine
what that must feel like.

550
00:56:00.710 --> 00:56:03.650
When you lived this
many lifes as he ...

551
00:56:04.724 --> 00:56:06.777
Fear of death is illogical.

552
00:56:09.107 --> 00:56:11.585
Fear of death ...

553
00:56:12.632 --> 00:56:14.632
Is what keeps us alive.

554
00:56:19.250 --> 00:56:21.115
I don't want to live as he did.

555
00:56:24.508 --> 00:56:26.133
That is why I decided ...

556
00:56:27.344 --> 00:56:29.856
To redirect my efforts and
continue his work ...


557
00:56:31.391 --> 00:56:32.859
On New Vulcan.

558
00:56:36.249 --> 00:56:38.022
You are leaving Starfleet ?

559
00:56:42.505 --> 00:56:44.321
What Jim have to say about that ?

560
00:56:46.189 --> 00:56:50.510
I could not find
the time to tell him.

561
00:56:50.511 --> 00:56:52.597
Oh, I can tell you
he is not gonna like that.


562
00:56:54.162 --> 00:56:56.381
Hell, I don't know what
he'll do without ya.


563
00:56:57.492 --> 00:57:00.787
I mean, you know, me on the other hand.
I would ... I'd throw a party.


564
00:57:09.998 --> 00:57:12.280
My god, you get delirious.

565
00:57:18.495 --> 00:57:20.223
How far are we from the coordinates
from that call ?


566
00:57:20.552 --> 00:57:21.967
Still a way, sir.

567
00:57:22.927 --> 00:57:24.099
Captain ?

568
00:57:24.845 --> 00:57:27.065
When did you begin to suspect her ?

569
00:57:29.164 --> 00:57:30.625
Not soon enough.

570
00:57:31.397 --> 00:57:32.597
How did you know ?

571
00:57:34.791 --> 00:57:38.733
I guess you can say I got
gut knows for danger.


572
00:57:42.123 --> 00:57:43.596
Run !

573
00:57:53.219 --> 00:57:54.552
Is that music ?

574
00:57:54.612 --> 00:57:56.247
Where the hell is that coming from ?

575
00:57:57.422 --> 00:57:58.674
There.

576
00:58:00.184 --> 00:58:03.670
I found the little box in the power cell
and delivering mouth like it sing.


577
00:58:04.629 --> 00:58:05.852
That's very clever.

578
00:58:06.401 --> 00:58:08.069
Music is a bit old fashion
for my taste.


579
00:58:08.104 --> 00:58:09.676
Not to mention very loud
and distracting ...


580
00:58:09.711 --> 00:58:11.236
But hey, well played !

581
00:58:12.719 --> 00:58:14.469
I like the beats and shouting.

582
00:58:14.494 --> 00:58:15.352
Well you do.

583
00:58:20.426 --> 00:58:21.729
- Switch it off.
- Ah, it's okay.


584
00:58:21.730 --> 00:58:22.687
Switch it off !

585
00:58:26.230 --> 00:58:28.010
Someone set the foot on my traps.

586
00:58:52.072 --> 00:58:53.321
Captain ?

587
00:58:53.665 --> 00:58:55.561
- You know these men ?
- Ay, Lassie.


588
00:58:55.562 --> 00:58:57.853
That's <i>wemanel</i>  is Pavel Chekov...

589
00:58:58.274 --> 00:59:00.593
And that handsome bastard is James T. Kirk.

590
00:59:00.912 --> 00:59:02.068
They are my mates.

591
00:59:02.446 --> 00:59:03.614
It's good to see you sir.

592
00:59:05.380 --> 00:59:06.848
- What is she doing Scotty ?
- Just ...


593
00:59:06.849 --> 00:59:08.799
Don't hurt them because ...

594
00:59:12.505 --> 00:59:14.229
You're free, James T.

595
00:59:16.057 --> 00:59:17.414
Mr. Scott.

596
00:59:22.802 --> 00:59:24.261
Who's your new friend here ?

597
00:59:25.003 --> 00:59:27.831
- She should have throw out the welcome mat.
- This is Jaylah.


598
00:59:27.856 --> 00:59:29.703
I do not know
what is a welcome mat.

599
00:59:30.263 --> 00:59:31.825
- You found anyone else ?
- No, sir.


600
00:59:32.890 --> 00:59:34.375
I'm sorry. You are the only ones.

601
00:59:34.407 --> 00:59:36.500
What the hell happened up there, Jim ?
Why were we attacked ?


602
00:59:36.662 --> 00:59:38.929
They were after the artifact
we brought back from Teenax.


603
00:59:39.026 --> 00:59:39.961
- Did they get it ?
- No.


604
00:59:40.038 --> 00:59:41.435
- Have you got it ?
- No.


605
00:59:41.460 --> 00:59:43.118
It did get off the Enterprise
when it was in the shuttle.


606
00:59:43.302 --> 00:59:45.337
- You hid it in a shuttle.
- Yes.


607
00:59:46.008 --> 00:59:47.311
And no.

608
01:00:01.303 --> 01:00:04.574
This is the USS Franklin, sir.
Can you believe it ?


609
01:00:04.788 --> 01:00:07.123
The first Earth ship capable of warp 4.

610
01:00:07.160 --> 01:00:10.001
Went missing in the gagarin radiation belt
in the early 2160.


611
01:00:10.080 --> 01:00:13.253
I remember that from the Academy.
Captain Balthazar Edison.


612
01:00:13.610 --> 01:00:16.833
It was his first year in Starfleet.
How the hell did the ship end up here ?


613
01:00:17.014 --> 01:00:18.343
There is a lot of theories, sir.

614
01:00:18.468 --> 01:00:19.738
Surrended to the Romulans.

615
01:00:19.886 --> 01:00:21.824
Captured by a giant green space hand.

616
01:00:21.972 --> 01:00:24.071
This farrer, must be a
wormhole displacement.


617
01:00:24.195 --> 01:00:25.202
Can she fly ?

618
01:00:25.491 --> 01:00:28.672
She is missing a few drive decoyls
and EPS conduits are fried ...


619
01:00:28.697 --> 01:00:32.175
but Jaylah has done a marvelous job
getting the ship systems back online.


620
01:00:32.826 --> 01:00:34.639
Thank you, Montgomery Scotty.

621
01:00:37.376 --> 01:00:39.545
Mr. Chekov,
Can you plug in the coordinates...


622
01:00:39.655 --> 01:00:41.904
See if we can track the crew's location
from the ship's sensors?


623
01:00:42.170 --> 01:00:43.196
Ay, Captain.

624
01:00:43.267 --> 01:00:44.341
He likes that seat.

625
01:00:44.352 --> 01:00:45.888
Mr. Scott, tour.

626
01:00:45.941 --> 01:00:47.887
Yes. The mess hall. 
Jaylah, get up.

627
01:00:48.071 --> 01:00:49.279
Yes.

628
01:01:11.484 --> 01:01:13.276
No clue what happend
to the crew, right ?

629
01:01:13.525 --> 01:01:15.879
No, sir. They would be
dead 100 years by now.


630
01:01:20.370 --> 01:01:21.639
Is that ... ?

631
01:01:22.144 --> 01:01:23.833
That's a PX-70.

632
01:01:28.582 --> 01:01:31.535
My dad used to have
one when I was a kid.

633
01:01:32.039 --> 01:01:35.359
Mom saying back there
it was driving her nuts.


634
01:01:38.833 --> 01:01:39.465
Sir.

635
01:01:43.961 --> 01:01:46.757
If you tell me this things
has been here this whole time and ...


636
01:01:46.782 --> 01:01:48.422
No one has ever noticed it?

637
01:01:59.048 --> 01:02:01.451
She sleeved up image reflectors.

638
01:02:03.774 --> 01:02:06.733
- Alright, some sort of
holographic camouflage.


639
01:02:06.757 --> 01:02:07.850
Ay, sir.

640
01:02:10.470 --> 01:02:11.255
Captain !

641
01:02:11.280 --> 01:02:14.468
I intercepted a weak communication
transmission, sir.


642
01:02:14.569 --> 01:02:16.434
It's a Starfleet frequency.

643
01:02:19.254 --> 01:02:20.566
Can you locate the signal ?

644
01:02:21.095 --> 01:02:23.417
Yes, but how do
we get to them ?

645
01:02:24.409 --> 01:02:27.690
I have an idea, sir,
but I'm gonna need your permission.


646
01:02:28.044 --> 01:02:29.219
Why would you need my permission ?

647
01:02:29.244 --> 01:02:30.833
Because if I mess up ...

648
01:02:30.858 --> 01:02:32.395
I don't want it
to be just my fault.

649
01:02:35.564 --> 01:02:38.597
McCoy and Spock Enteprise crew.
Come in, Enterprise crew.


650
01:02:39.463 --> 01:02:40.598
Anyone.

651
01:02:45.373 --> 01:02:46.818
Come on, Spock.

652
01:02:47.291 --> 01:02:49.155
Come on, we can make it.

653
01:02:50.990 --> 01:02:55.223
Leaving me behind will significantly
increase your chances of survival, doctor.


654
01:02:55.248 --> 01:02:57.347
Well, I stand sure
that is completly out of question.


655
01:02:57.448 --> 01:03:01.107
It is imperative that you locate
any surviving crew.


656
01:03:01.132 --> 01:03:02.912
No, I am sticking
with you, i don't care.

657
01:03:10.679 --> 01:03:11.831
Of course I care about ...

658
01:03:14.888 --> 01:03:17.511
I always assumed my respect
for you is clear.


659
01:03:20.429 --> 01:03:22.624
Dialogue we have had across the years...

660
01:03:22.625 --> 01:03:26.438
It's okay, Spock.
You don't have to say it.


661
01:03:30.417 --> 01:03:32.393
Well, at least I won't die alone.

662
01:03:39.168 --> 01:03:40.755
Well, that's just typical.

663
01:03:44.981 --> 01:03:46.225
Come on you bastard !

664
01:03:54.748 --> 01:03:56.507
Good to see you
in one piece doctor !

665
01:03:56.532 --> 01:03:57.399
Oh, am I ?

666
01:03:58.165 --> 01:03:59.895
I feel like my entrails
were at barn days.


667
01:03:59.920 --> 01:04:02.389
I released old transporters
were only ever used for cargo.


668
01:04:02.424 --> 01:04:04.361
But a few modifications seems
to do the trick.


669
01:04:04.386 --> 01:04:06.281
I thought it was best
to beam you one at a time.


670
01:04:06.306 --> 01:04:08.168
You know, in case you got displaced.

671
01:04:10.037 --> 01:04:11.673
Oh, I couldn't imagine a worse scenario.

672
01:04:12.408 --> 01:04:13.818
Good to have you back.
You all right ?


673
01:04:13.853 --> 01:04:15.072
Yeah, I'm fine. He's hurt.

674
01:04:15.097 --> 01:04:16.682
I am functioning adequately, Captain.

675
01:04:16.852 --> 01:04:18.093
In a pigs eye, you are.

676
01:04:18.094 --> 01:04:18.995
Captain ...

677
01:04:19.020 --> 01:04:22.183
We discovered that the stolen artifact
appears to have come from this planet.


678
01:04:22.705 --> 01:04:24.036
Damn it, Spock !

679
01:04:24.813 --> 01:04:26.412
Are there any medical supplies
on this thing ?


680
01:04:26.436 --> 01:04:27.238
This way.

681
01:04:34.115 --> 01:04:35.598
Lay down, come on.

682
01:04:36.202 --> 01:04:37.202
There you go.

683
01:04:40.002 --> 01:04:41.252
How are we gonna get
out of this hole, Spock ?


684
01:04:41.277 --> 01:04:42.099
We got ...

685
01:04:42.624 --> 01:04:43.940
No ship, no crew.

686
01:04:43.965 --> 01:04:44.752
Not the best odds..

687
01:04:44.914 --> 01:04:46.532
We will do what
we have always done, Jim.

688
01:04:46.533 --> 01:04:49.169
We will find hope in the impossible.

689
01:04:49.194 --> 01:04:50.939
Let's get you patched up first, okay ?

690
01:04:50.964 --> 01:04:51.635
Captain.

691
01:04:51.933 --> 01:04:54.284
You must focus your efforts
on helping the crew.


692
01:04:54.309 --> 01:04:56.222
That's why I need you around Spock.

693
01:04:59.566 --> 01:05:01.153
This thing is from dark ages.

694
01:05:02.465 --> 01:05:03.394
Closer.

695
01:05:05.679 --> 01:05:08.173
I am pretty sure this is protoplaser.

696
01:05:08.361 --> 01:05:11.282
To stop the internal emergy.
At least that's my hope.


697
01:05:11.446 --> 01:05:15.064
The miserable have
no other medicine but only hope.


698
01:05:15.908 --> 01:05:17.842
Deathstorn is quoting Shakespeare.

699
01:05:21.555 --> 01:05:24.800
<i>Captain's Log, 
Stardate 2263.2</i>

700
01:05:27.697 --> 01:05:29.659
We searched the wreckage.

701
01:05:29.683 --> 01:05:31.683
He must have hidden it elsewhere.

702
01:05:35.496 --> 01:05:39.496
All we have is his crew, krall.

703
01:05:49.602 --> 01:05:51.560
Tell me where it is.

704
01:05:51.757 --> 01:05:52.761
Now !

705
01:05:53.549 --> 01:05:55.380
No !

706
01:05:56.704 --> 01:05:57.904
Stop !

707
01:05:59.738 --> 01:06:01.511
Let him go and, 
I will give what you want.

708
01:06:01.536 --> 01:06:03.063
No, Syl ! Don't !

709
01:06:27.439 --> 01:06:28.923
Lieutenant.

710
01:06:28.958 --> 01:06:32.744
Unity is not your strength.

711
01:06:35.449 --> 01:06:37.201
It is your weakness.

712
01:07:12.699 --> 01:07:15.050
We should wait until
we are absolutely sure.


713
01:07:15.270 --> 01:07:17.676
No, we have to
get the crew back, now.

714
01:07:18.464 --> 01:07:21.162
Chekov has the coordinates that
can lead us to Krall's base, so we go.


715
01:07:21.217 --> 01:07:24.500
With respect, sir, how do we know
that Krall was at the base when she called.


716
01:07:24.601 --> 01:07:26.463
And even if he was, we do not know if
and the crew is with them.


717
01:07:26.526 --> 01:07:27.539
Or still alive.

718
01:07:27.640 --> 01:07:29.987
Mr. Chekov, Can you reconfigure
the search parameters ...


719
01:07:30.042 --> 01:07:31.906
In order to compensate for this formula ?

720
01:07:33.256 --> 01:07:35.951
Ay, Commander but, what is this forumla ?

721
01:07:36.663 --> 01:07:39.483
It is vokaya, Mr. Chekov.
A mineral unique to Vulcan ...


722
01:07:39.484 --> 01:07:40.984
Which emits a low-level radiation.

723
01:07:41.204 --> 01:07:44.025
I'll have to filter out
all other energy emissions.


724
01:07:44.226 --> 01:07:47.203
Spock, what the hell would a Vulcan
mineral be doing way out here ?


725
01:07:47.204 --> 01:07:48.204
Where are you going with this ?

726
01:07:48.205 --> 01:07:49.949
Lt. Uhura wears a vokaya amulet

727
01:07:49.950 --> 01:07:53.033
which I presented to her
as a token of my affection and respect.


728
01:07:53.541 --> 01:07:55.466
You gave your girlfriend
a radioactive jewelery ?


729
01:07:55.607 --> 01:07:57.053
The emissions is harmless, Doctor.

730
01:07:57.054 --> 01:07:59.388
But it's unique signature makes it
very easy to identify.


731
01:08:00.054 --> 01:08:02.152
You gave your girlfriend
a tracking device ?


732
01:08:05.974 --> 01:08:07.724
That was not my intention.

733
01:08:08.783 --> 01:08:10.903
I am glad he doesn't respect me.

734
01:08:22.504 --> 01:08:26.201
I am detecting a weary trace of
mount of vokaya.


735
01:08:26.660 --> 01:08:30.248
Does the location match the coordinates
you acquired from Kalari, Mr. Chekov ?


736
01:08:30.514 --> 01:08:31.729
It is a match, sir.

737
01:08:31.768 --> 01:08:34.278
It's presence suggest that Lt. Uhura
and thereby the rest of the crew


738
01:08:34.303 --> 01:08:36.462
Are being held at Krall's base
of operation.


739
01:08:36.827 --> 01:08:38.036
Can we beam them out?

740
01:08:38.303 --> 01:08:41.205
No, sir.
There is some geological interference ...


741
01:08:41.230 --> 01:08:43.702
That is blocking transporter signal.

742
01:08:43.727 --> 01:08:46.556
Well I guess we are gonna have to go
and break in the old fashion way.


743
01:08:46.581 --> 01:08:49.312
You can not go to this place.

744
01:08:50.250 --> 01:08:52.578
Everyone who goes there, he kills.

745
01:08:54.019 --> 01:08:56.399
You've been there ? 
You've seen it ?

746
01:08:56.717 --> 01:08:58.076
Why did you say something, Lassie ?

747
01:08:58.146 --> 01:09:00.448
Because I knew you will ask me
to take you there.


748
01:09:02.631 --> 01:09:06.244
If your friends are there then
they will die, just like my family.


749
01:09:06.538 --> 01:09:08.760
And I will not go
back to that death place.

750
01:09:08.888 --> 01:09:11.666
If you escaped than you can show us
the way in and the way out.


751
01:09:11.752 --> 01:09:12.537
No!

752
01:09:12.562 --> 01:09:15.461
This is not the deal we made,
Montgomery Scotty.


753
01:09:17.153 --> 01:09:19.544
If you choose to do this,
you are on your own.


754
01:09:20.307 --> 01:09:22.569
- Wait, wait.
- Let her go.


755
01:09:22.594 --> 01:09:24.894
She's lost people too, Captain.

756
01:09:33.691 --> 01:09:37.398
Wait, that's our friends out there Lassie,
and we can not just leave them behind.


757
01:09:38.347 --> 01:09:40.877
We could really use your help.

758
01:09:41.414 --> 01:09:43.597
We just need you
to be brave as all.

759
01:09:45.352 --> 01:09:47.393
When we run in that place ...

760
01:09:48.015 --> 01:09:50.144
Krall will come in and take someone.

761
01:09:50.891 --> 01:09:54.354
There were screams, 
I can still hear them.

762
01:09:55.935 --> 01:09:57.709
And we would not
see that person again ...

763
01:09:57.733 --> 01:09:59.733
We did not know who would be next.

764
01:10:06.154 --> 01:10:07.746
My father planned an escape.

765
01:10:08.226 --> 01:10:09.996
But we were seen by the ...

766
01:10:10.079 --> 01:10:12.012
By the one they call Manas.

767
01:10:15.164 --> 01:10:18.956
My father fought him
so i could get out.

768
01:10:19.290 --> 01:10:21.241
He was brave ...

769
01:10:21.265 --> 01:10:23.265
And Manas killed him.

770
01:10:25.072 --> 01:10:26.792
What you want is impossible.

771
01:10:30.025 --> 01:10:31.773
Maybe it's not.

772
01:10:32.719 --> 01:10:36.173
Maywe granny used to say :
"you cannot break a stick in a bundle".


773
01:10:37.773 --> 01:10:39.462
You're a part of something
bigger now, Lassie.


774
01:10:40.707 --> 01:10:41.871
Don't give up on that...

775
01:10:42.013 --> 01:10:44.015
Because we are sur as hell,
we'll never give up on you ...


776
01:10:44.348 --> 01:10:46.348
That is what being part of crew
is all about.


777
01:10:48.397 --> 01:10:50.278
Is that what you
believe in, James T. ?

778
01:10:53.303 --> 01:10:56.106
All I know is, we stand
a better chance with you.


779
01:10:58.326 --> 01:11:01.290
The diggind machines uncover the tunnel
that goes into the crater


780
01:11:01.345 --> 01:11:02.558
That's how we get out.

781
01:11:02.593 --> 01:11:04.201
Also that'll be our way in?

782
01:11:04.348 --> 01:11:07.489
The away team will beam to
the other side of the tunnel,
follow it across to the base ...


783
01:11:07.514 --> 01:11:09.543
Get inside the building,
break out the crew.


784
01:11:09.570 --> 01:11:13.075
Captain, we can not locate
anyone inside the crater ...


785
01:11:13.110 --> 01:11:14.134
In order to beam them out.

786
01:11:14.159 --> 01:11:16.297
Or, I can bring up pulse beacons
to path enhancers


787
01:11:16.332 --> 01:11:18.084
- That I get signal into the crater.
- Alright.


788
01:11:18.109 --> 01:11:20.100
How many people can
Franklin transport at the time?


789
01:11:20.125 --> 01:11:22.412
With a minor modifications,

790
01:11:22.437 --> 01:11:23.896
But I am not sure
how long it will hold out.


791
01:11:24.398 --> 01:11:26.903
Bones, Mr. Chekov and Jaylah,
would be in the away team.


792
01:11:26.938 --> 01:11:28.835
Mr Scott, modify the transporter

793
01:11:28.870 --> 01:11:30.891
and do whatever you can
to make this ship operational.


794
01:11:30.916 --> 01:11:32.899
Ay captain, Mr. 
Chekov's technical acumen

795
01:11:32.934 --> 01:11:35.585
makes him more valuable onboard
the Franklin with Mr. Scott.


796
01:11:35.719 --> 01:11:37.812
Is there by logical that
I would replace him.


797
01:11:37.837 --> 01:11:40.669
Why is that logical Spock ?
You just got back on your feet.


798
01:11:41.129 --> 01:11:43.611
Lt. Uhura's in that facillity, Jim.

799
01:11:46.480 --> 01:11:48.670
I'll keep an eye on him.

800
01:11:48.977 --> 01:11:50.299
Understood.

801
01:11:50.334 --> 01:11:53.737
His soldiers are everywhere.
We won't pass unseen.


802
01:11:53.762 --> 01:11:56.040
What we require is a diversion.

803
01:12:02.041 --> 01:12:04.039
I think I have an idea.

804
01:12:28.735 --> 01:12:31.397
This is Abronath.

805
01:12:32.392 --> 01:12:35.739
It was used by the
ancient once as a weapon

806
01:12:36.109 --> 01:12:39.287
But when they could not
control its deadly power ...


807
01:12:39.322 --> 01:12:42.231
They split it into two ...

808
01:12:42.266 --> 01:12:45.297
And rejected the halves into space ...

809
01:12:45.332 --> 01:12:47.434
Hoping it will be lost forever.

810
01:12:51.285 --> 01:12:53.282
But I am grateful.

811
01:12:53.917 --> 01:12:58.004
I have spent life times searching for.

812
01:12:58.039 --> 01:13:02.620
And only to have
you find it for me.

813
01:13:06.703 --> 01:13:09.182
The poetry of fate.

814
01:13:12.002 --> 01:13:14.603
The world that I was born into ...

815
01:13:14.638 --> 01:13:17.621
Is very different from yours, Lieutenant.

816
01:13:17.646 --> 01:13:20.379
We knew pain, we knew terror.

817
01:13:20.414 --> 01:13:23.842
Struggle, made us strong.

818
01:13:23.877 --> 01:13:26.432
Not peace, not unity.

819
01:13:26.457 --> 01:13:30.894
These are myths the Federation
would had you believe.


820
01:13:35.118 --> 01:13:36.720
Those are strong words.

821
01:13:36.944 --> 01:13:38.420
You may even believe them.

822
01:13:38.421 --> 01:13:40.429
But there's something else
going on with you.


823
01:13:40.859 --> 01:13:42.277
Something underneath.

824
01:13:46.175 --> 01:13:47.616
Wait.

825
01:13:48.001 --> 01:13:49.381
What are you doing with her ?

826
01:13:50.605 --> 01:13:53.155
You already got what you want !
Let her go !


827
01:13:53.647 --> 01:13:54.952
<i>No !</i>

828
01:14:30.550 --> 01:14:31.608
Manas.

829
01:14:31.832 --> 01:14:33.832
It's time.

830
01:14:35.395 --> 01:14:39.001
The Federation has pushed
the frontier for centuries.


831
01:14:39.036 --> 01:14:40.412
But no longer.

832
01:14:40.985 --> 01:14:43.215
This is where it begins, Lieutenant.

833
01:14:46.442 --> 01:14:50.092
This is where the frontier,
pushes back.


834
01:15:03.238 --> 01:15:04.519
This way.

835
01:15:21.421 --> 01:15:23.013
Where is she ?

836
01:15:43.430 --> 01:15:45.789
I got to admit,
that's a hell of a distraction.


837
01:15:46.811 --> 01:15:48.481
Your friends are over there.

838
01:15:51.475 --> 01:15:52.662
Come on.

839
01:15:54.621 --> 01:15:55.726
Let me deal with them.

840
01:15:56.445 --> 01:15:57.947
You've brought us this far.

841
01:15:58.439 --> 01:16:00.525
Finish the mission, krall.

842
01:16:07.482 --> 01:16:08.482
Go !

843
01:16:41.811 --> 01:16:44.306
Commander, Uhura they took her.

844
01:16:47.072 --> 01:16:49.069
Get the remain of the crew to safety.

845
01:16:49.887 --> 01:16:51.333
Come on. Let's go. Move.

846
01:16:59.170 --> 01:17:00.988
- I've got them, Mr Scott.
- Okay, Mr. Chekov.


847
01:17:01.013 --> 01:17:03.342
Increase the signal.
We are gonna grab them 20 at a time.


848
01:17:03.367 --> 01:17:05.316
- Ay.
- Let's hope this doesn't get messy.


849
01:17:05.341 --> 01:17:06.664
Energize !

850
01:17:41.984 --> 01:17:43.066
Spock !

851
01:17:43.496 --> 01:17:45.590
What are you doing here ?

852
01:17:46.507 --> 01:17:49.658
Clearly,
I am here to rescue you.


853
01:17:50.240 --> 01:17:51.467
Let's go.

854
01:17:59.348 --> 01:18:00.678
Good to see you, man.

855
01:18:27.420 --> 01:18:31.147
You'll die here as your father.

856
01:19:22.394 --> 01:19:24.540
Ten seconds
until transporters recharged, doctor.


857
01:19:24.641 --> 01:19:25.848
Wait for my signal.

858
01:19:25.849 --> 01:19:27.934
- Doctor!
- Damn it man, we are not leaving without them !


859
01:19:31.316 --> 01:19:31.920
Come on ! Let's go !

860
01:19:31.966 --> 01:19:32.744
Move ! move !

861
01:20:00.332 --> 01:20:02.650
We are ready for an extract,
just turn on your beacon.


862
01:20:02.948 --> 01:20:04.802
- Scotty, you have everybody?
- Ay, sir.


863
01:20:04.827 --> 01:20:05.997
Everyones here except you and Jeylah.

864
01:20:06.022 --> 01:20:07.883
Start the beacon and we will grab ya.

865
01:20:16.627 --> 01:20:20.361
They will leave you here.

866
01:20:23.167 --> 01:20:24.476
Captain, your beacon !

867
01:20:55.467 --> 01:20:56.814
- There it is !
- Energize !


868
01:21:00.196 --> 01:21:02.184
Jaylah !

869
01:21:15.550 --> 01:21:18.497
Okay, let's never do that again.

870
01:21:19.084 --> 01:21:20.541
I agree, James T.

871
01:21:24.179 --> 01:21:24.852
You all right ?

872
01:21:25.067 --> 01:21:27.242
Captain this thing he has ...

873
01:21:27.344 --> 01:21:30.688
Yorktown. He is gonna destroy the Yorktown.

874
01:21:32.502 --> 01:21:34.199
You take my house ...

875
01:21:34.861 --> 01:21:37.271
And you make it fly.

876
01:21:40.256 --> 01:21:41.781
Mr. Scotty,
can you get this thing started ?


877
01:21:41.882 --> 01:21:44.181
Start it, yes.
Flying sir, that's a different thing.


878
01:21:44.206 --> 01:21:45.920
These old vessel, they were built in space.

879
01:21:45.945 --> 01:21:48.129
They were never supposed
to take off from the atmosphere.


880
01:21:48.154 --> 01:21:49.586
Make it happen.

881
01:21:49.611 --> 01:21:51.794
They are called Starships sir,
for a reason.


882
01:21:51.819 --> 01:21:52.831
You tell me this now ?

883
01:21:52.866 --> 01:21:56.224
Because I didn't want to disappoint ya.
You know, in case we didn't make it back.


884
01:21:56.569 --> 01:21:57.621
How thoughtful, Mr. Scott.

885
01:21:57.683 --> 01:21:59.004
Captain.

886
01:22:05.822 --> 01:22:07.016
He is launching.

887
01:22:13.851 --> 01:22:16.335
The attack at the Yorktown
may be just the beginning.


888
01:22:16.870 --> 01:22:18.273
With this bioweapon...

889
01:22:18.274 --> 01:22:19.652
He could get rid of all life ...

890
01:22:19.653 --> 01:22:21.256
And use the bases advanced technology...

891
01:22:21.257 --> 01:22:23.647
To attack an untold number
of Federation planets.


892
01:22:25.896 --> 01:22:27.822
We are just gonna have to
get this thing flying.


893
01:22:27.869 --> 01:22:30.251
We can not just jump start it, sir.

894
01:22:35.610 --> 01:22:37.486
Okay, all systems online.

895
01:22:37.511 --> 01:22:41.135
Dilithium chambers
at 70% and raising.


896
01:22:41.160 --> 01:22:44.096
Primary subwarp engines standing by.

897
01:22:46.072 --> 01:22:47.388
Mr. Sulu.

898
01:22:47.438 --> 01:22:48.673
You can ...

899
01:22:48.697 --> 01:22:49.776
You know ...

900
01:22:49.801 --> 01:22:51.921
Fly this thing, right ?

901
01:22:52.624 --> 01:22:53.740
You're kidding me, sir ?

902
01:22:54.218 --> 01:22:55.779
Fantastic.

903
01:22:56.160 --> 01:22:57.804
Scotty, how are we looking ?

904
01:22:58.361 --> 01:23:00.118
Ready as she will never be, sir.

905
01:23:00.153 --> 01:23:01.312
That's what I like to hear.
Alright.


906
01:23:01.390 --> 01:23:03.456
Bones, where are we with the crew ?

907
01:23:03.548 --> 01:23:04.633
I could use a functioning med bay ...

908
01:23:04.658 --> 01:23:06.510
But otherwise we are secure down here.

909
01:23:06.837 --> 01:23:08.354
Mr. Sulu.

910
01:23:08.389 --> 01:23:10.436
We have to achieve a terminal velocity ...

911
01:23:10.437 --> 01:23:12.909
In order for the stabilizers
to provide lift.


912
01:23:12.970 --> 01:23:15.717
Are you sure this drop
is high enough to do that ?


913
01:23:17.126 --> 01:23:18.746
We'll find out.

914
01:23:27.366 --> 01:23:29.316
Call it, Mr. Sulu.

915
01:23:29.351 --> 01:23:30.525
Ay ay, Captain.

916
01:23:31.157 --> 01:23:33.242
Mr. Chekov,
be ready to hit the forward stabilizers ...


917
01:23:33.277 --> 01:23:35.021
Full on my mark. 
One quarter impulse.

918
01:23:35.046 --> 01:23:35.935
Right.

919
01:23:57.688 --> 01:24:00.316
- One half impulse, Mr. Chekov.
- Ay.


920
01:24:02.572 --> 01:24:03.959
We should belt up. 
Come on, move move!

921
01:24:13.865 --> 01:24:15.897
Easy, Mr. Sulu.
Let's not break her now.


922
01:24:51.450 --> 01:24:54.033
Anytime, Mr. Sulu.

923
01:24:58.445 --> 01:25:00.278
Now, Mr. Chekov.

924
01:26:12.672 --> 01:26:14.592
I have an alert on incoming vessel.

925
01:26:15.659 --> 01:26:18.348
No reply on all frequency ID request.

926
01:26:18.402 --> 01:26:19.676
Visual.

927
01:26:33.150 --> 01:26:34.846
Red alert! Red alert!

928
01:26:45.348 --> 01:26:47.888
Look how far they've come.

929
01:27:01.539 --> 01:27:05.024
I'm picking up distress signals from
every frequency coming from Yorktown.


930
01:27:06.859 --> 01:27:08.128
Krall is already starting the attack.

931
01:27:08.814 --> 01:27:10.733
Mr. Scott, what kind of
weapons do we have ?


932
01:27:11.165 --> 01:27:14.728
We have pulse phased cannons
and spatial torpedoes.


933
01:27:14.884 --> 01:27:16.150
Great. Lock and load.

934
01:27:16.175 --> 01:27:18.738
That does not matter.
You can no defeat the bees.


935
01:27:18.773 --> 01:27:21.031
Maybe, maybe we will lore them away.

936
01:27:21.058 --> 01:27:23.754
How do we get Yorktown time
to get people to safety ?


937
01:27:23.789 --> 01:27:25.609
We are on course and buggy competitors.

938
01:27:25.644 --> 01:27:27.640
We are barely holding
together as it is, Captain.

939
01:27:27.665 --> 01:27:28.367
Captain.

940
01:27:28.392 --> 01:27:31.423
The flight paterns of bees
are determined by individual decisions.

941
01:27:31.448 --> 01:27:33.485
Krall's form formations are to complex ...

942
01:27:33.524 --> 01:27:36.627
Not to rely on some form of unified
cyberpathic coordination.


943
01:27:36.666 --> 01:27:38.328
- Assuming that we could be...
- Spock.


944
01:27:38.353 --> 01:27:39.284
Skip to the end.

945
01:27:39.309 --> 01:27:41.293
What he is saying that
if we disorient the swarm ...


946
01:27:41.294 --> 01:27:42.462
We can kick it's ass.

947
01:27:43.477 --> 01:27:44.589
Precisely.

948
01:27:45.764 --> 01:27:47.743
Scotty, can you beam me onto
one of those swarm ships ?


949
01:27:47.744 --> 01:27:49.160
Have you gone completly mad ?

950
01:27:49.161 --> 01:27:50.636
- Yes or no ?
- No.


951
01:27:50.685 --> 01:27:51.528
Yes.

952
01:27:51.752 --> 01:27:52.596
Maybe.

953
01:27:52.597 --> 01:27:56.525
Captain, my familiarity with the interior
of those ships, however brave


954
01:27:56.560 --> 01:27:58.632
makes me more qualified
for this away mission.


955
01:27:58.657 --> 01:28:00.434
Spock, you're still hurt.

956
01:28:00.738 --> 01:28:02.380
She's right, Spock.

957
01:28:03.727 --> 01:28:05.734
I acknowledge and respect your concerns.

958
01:28:06.714 --> 01:28:09.255
Perhaps you will feel more confident
if I were accompanied by someone


959
01:28:09.256 --> 01:28:12.479
with familiarity of both the ship
and my injury.


960
01:28:13.766 --> 01:28:15.366
He is gonna love this.

961
01:28:17.039 --> 01:28:18.436
You want me to do what?

962
01:28:19.517 --> 01:28:20.688
Come along, doctor.

963
01:28:20.889 --> 01:28:22.007
Whoo, wait a minute.

964
01:28:22.149 --> 01:28:25.260
Why you green-blooded ingrain
This was your idea.


965
01:28:25.891 --> 01:28:27.005
It's a good idea, Bones.

966
01:28:27.074 --> 01:28:29.792
You know, next time you have piece of pipes
stuck in your trousers ...


967
01:28:30.092 --> 01:28:31.123
Call a plumber.

968
01:28:31.218 --> 01:28:33.070
Let's make sure you find a way
to break these things.


969
01:28:33.071 --> 01:28:35.155
If it gets heady
I'll beam ya straight back.


970
01:28:35.156 --> 01:28:36.156
Energize.

971
01:28:36.680 --> 01:28:38.280
It will be great!

972
01:28:38.510 --> 01:28:40.561
Damn it, Jim.
I'm a doctor, not...


973
01:28:47.795 --> 01:28:50.767
You do realize *something something*
these things


974
01:28:51.002 --> 01:28:52.032
We crash.

975
01:28:59.236 --> 01:29:00.700
Hit something.

976
01:29:00.801 --> 01:29:01.801
Spock by Franklin.

977
01:29:02.028 --> 01:29:03.209
Spock, we read you.

978
01:29:03.210 --> 01:29:06.450
Captain, from what I can intricate, these ships
do with the shared cyberpathic language ...


979
01:29:06.451 --> 01:29:07.877
That coordinates their actions.

980
01:29:08.041 --> 01:29:09.273
Patching it through now.

981
01:29:10.133 --> 01:29:11.804
That's what they signalize.

982
01:29:13.214 --> 01:29:15.589
They weren't jamming us,
they were talking to each other.


983
01:29:15.590 --> 01:29:17.732
How do we get
them to stop talking ?

984
01:29:17.833 --> 01:29:19.528
What about an electromagnetic focusing ?

985
01:29:19.529 --> 01:29:21.438
We can use the transporters
to disturb their network.


986
01:29:21.439 --> 01:29:22.729
Focus might be too specific.

987
01:29:23.056 --> 01:29:25.816
If you can plant some sort of disruptive
communication signal inside the swarm


988
01:29:25.817 --> 01:29:28.027
It might inversely effect capacity
the way it coordinates.


989
01:29:28.328 --> 01:29:31.089
It will have to be the frequency
they will not anticipate.


990
01:29:31.133 --> 01:29:33.775
It will cause a chain reaction
that will wipe out the whole swarm.


991
01:29:33.776 --> 01:29:37.560
Sir, a closed network like that might
be sensitible to very high frequency.


992
01:29:38.058 --> 01:29:39.571
VHF.

993
01:29:39.726 --> 01:29:40.246
Radio.

994
01:29:40.270 --> 01:29:42.270
We can...
We can broadcast something from the ship ...


995
01:29:42.347 --> 01:29:43.347
To drawn out the links.

996
01:29:43.348 --> 01:29:44.668
Something loud and distracting.

997
01:29:44.692 --> 01:29:46.192
Loud and distracting ?

998
01:29:47.872 --> 01:29:49.499
I've got just the thing.

999
01:29:49.700 --> 01:29:51.378
Do not break my music.

1000
01:29:51.379 --> 01:29:53.744
Break it ?
It will get an upgrade.


1001
01:30:06.480 --> 01:30:08.474
Swarm ships in 60 seconds
will break in through.


1002
01:30:08.875 --> 01:30:11.946
I just got to reconfigure the VHF
array range multiphasic swipe.


1003
01:30:12.301 --> 01:30:13.914
- Let me do it.
- No, Lassie I am in a hurry.


1004
01:30:13.915 --> 01:30:14.915
Do it.

1005
01:30:20.811 --> 01:30:21.531
There, see ?

1006
01:30:21.755 --> 01:30:22.755
Simple.

1007
01:30:22.779 --> 01:30:23.647
Alright.

1008
01:30:23.648 --> 01:30:25.193
Captain, we are ready to broadcast.

1009
01:30:25.376 --> 01:30:27.758
The signal won't travel far,
we have to get closer.


1010
01:30:27.988 --> 01:30:30.087
- How close ?
- Very.


1011
01:30:30.188 --> 01:30:31.739
Intercept course, Mr. Sulu.

1012
01:30:47.392 --> 01:30:49.135
My old friend.

1013
01:30:59.936 --> 01:31:03.879
The swarms ships are doubling back there
and forming a tech wave, sir.


1014
01:31:03.904 --> 01:31:05.255
I think we got their attention.

1015
01:31:05.280 --> 01:31:06.486
Hold steady, Mr. Sulu.

1016
01:31:06.687 --> 01:31:07.793
Brace yourselves, everybody.

1017
01:31:07.794 --> 01:31:09.303
Spock, stand by to drop out
of formation.


1018
01:31:09.389 --> 01:31:11.568
- Scotty, all queued up back there ?
- Ay, sir.


1019
01:31:11.569 --> 01:31:14.196
Ready to broadcast at 57.7 MHz.

1020
01:31:14.197 --> 01:31:16.659
- Made your choice, Lassie?
- I have the beat and shouting.


1021
01:31:40.338 --> 01:31:42.592
Let's make some noise.

1022
01:31:50.462 --> 01:31:51.824
That's a good choice.

1023
01:32:05.056 --> 01:32:06.615
Faster, Doc. We risk to be consumed ...

1024
01:32:06.650 --> 01:32:08.132
By the trajectorial defects.

1025
01:32:08.319 --> 01:32:09.814
Impact seat fibers.

1026
01:32:10.285 --> 01:32:12.892
- Get ready, Doctor !
- God damn, I see it !


1027
01:32:32.319 --> 01:32:34.184
Is that classical music ?

1028
01:32:35.479 --> 01:32:37.422
Yes, Doctor.
It'd seems to be.


1029
01:32:37.862 --> 01:32:41.339
Lt. Uhura, make sure Yorktown
has the frequency to broadcast.


1030
01:32:44.042 --> 01:32:45.971
Sir, we now have the distraction frequency.

1031
01:32:46.392 --> 01:32:47.737
Broadcast !

1032
01:33:08.498 --> 01:33:09.921
You're all right, Spock ?

1033
01:33:09.922 --> 01:33:11.046
We are fine, Captain.

1034
01:33:11.070 --> 01:33:13.070
But there are still three ships
heading into Yorktown.


1035
01:33:13.147 --> 01:33:14.147
That's got to be Krall.

1036
01:33:14.148 --> 01:33:15.198
Keep on him, Spock.

1037
01:33:15.222 --> 01:33:18.022
Do whatever it takes to stop him
from using that weapon.


1038
01:33:37.543 --> 01:33:39.657
My house is breaking!

1039
01:33:39.658 --> 01:33:41.944
Mass depolarization of hull plating.

1040
01:33:41.969 --> 01:33:45.352
Maybe I can redirect the power from
the dilithium chamber, but I need help.


1041
01:33:45.377 --> 01:33:47.488
I need you, Jaylah.
Let's go!


1042
01:34:13.186 --> 01:34:14.351
Do not lose them, Doctor.

1043
01:34:14.458 --> 01:34:16.831
We can always change places
if you want, Spock.


1044
01:34:38.034 --> 01:34:41.540
Captain, intercepting all three ships
is an impossibility.


1045
01:34:45.454 --> 01:34:47.629
Give me schematic of Yorktown.

1046
01:34:48.798 --> 01:34:50.875
There. Yorktown headquarters.

1047
01:34:50.876 --> 01:34:53.362
Mr. Chekov, can you do a bioscan
on central plaza ?


1048
01:34:53.552 --> 01:34:54.633
Ay.

1049
01:34:54.657 --> 01:34:56.426
They are clearing civilians.

1050
01:34:56.427 --> 01:34:58.325
Bones, there's a city plaza coming up.

1051
01:34:58.326 --> 01:35:00.393
You have to make
sure Krall heads for it.

1052
01:35:00.584 --> 01:35:02.396
- Why?
- Just do it !


1053
01:35:17.899 --> 01:35:19.451
Sulu, get us up there !

1054
01:35:19.452 --> 01:35:20.938
Hold onto something !

1055
01:36:15.364 --> 01:36:17.825
- Great work, Bones.
- Thanks, Captain.


1056
01:36:18.226 --> 01:36:20.560
Now I just have to
figure out how to land.

1057
01:36:26.721 --> 01:36:29.471
Captain, I have 3 hull breaches
from the impact.


1058
01:36:29.672 --> 01:36:32.435
Deck 3, the cargo
bay and the engine room.

1059
01:36:33.299 --> 01:36:35.942
Alright, Sulu, Chekov, check
the cargo bay and deck 3.


1060
01:36:35.943 --> 01:36:39.064
I need confirmation that the weapon has
been neutralized and that Krall is dead.


1061
01:36:57.430 --> 01:36:59.002
Captain.

1062
01:37:05.322 --> 01:37:07.592
It's Krall. We've seen him do this.

1063
01:37:07.854 --> 01:37:11.328
It's a somekind of energy transfer,
and it physically changes him.


1064
01:37:11.500 --> 01:37:14.892
He must still be on board.
No one seen him leave.


1065
01:37:16.724 --> 01:37:18.978
Sulu, contact Yorktown security ...

1066
01:37:18.979 --> 01:37:20.013
...to lockdown the ship.

1067
01:37:20.014 --> 01:37:21.014
Let's go.

1068
01:37:53.851 --> 01:37:55.345
Captain.

1069
01:37:56.255 --> 01:37:58.255
<i>...expand the frontier...</i>

1070
01:38:02.536 --> 01:38:05.187
<i>...expand the frontier...</i>

1071
01:38:22.277 --> 01:38:23.418
It's him.

1072
01:38:24.707 --> 01:38:27.342
Scotty, I need you
to link to Franklin database.


1073
01:38:27.561 --> 01:38:29.957
Find out what you can about
Balthazar Edison.


1074
01:38:30.013 --> 01:38:31.676
- What the Captain on a Franklin ?
- Yes.


1075
01:38:31.677 --> 01:38:33.317
He is long dead.

1076
01:38:33.342 --> 01:38:36.565
No he is not. I do not know how,
but Edison is Krall.


1077
01:38:47.148 --> 01:38:48.238
What did you find ?

1078
01:38:48.239 --> 01:38:51.172
Well, his records goes back
when Federation didn't even exist .


1079
01:38:51.173 --> 01:38:54.189
He was a major in the United Earth
Military Assault Command Operation.


1080
01:38:54.190 --> 01:38:55.850
Along in the offworld combat.

1081
01:38:55.851 --> 01:38:58.246
- He was a soldier.
- Ay, sir. And pretty good one.


1082
01:38:58.247 --> 01:39:00.832
His military service came to an end
when MACO was disbanded.


1083
01:39:00.833 --> 01:39:01.833
Why ? What happened ?

1084
01:39:01.834 --> 01:39:04.644
The Federation sir, Starfleet.
We are not a military agency.


1085
01:39:04.645 --> 01:39:06.351
They made him captain and
gave him a Franklin.


1086
01:39:06.567 --> 01:39:08.108
- Scotty, bring up his logs.
- Ay, sir.


1087
01:39:09.944 --> 01:39:10.995
<i>Captain's Log...</i>

1088
01:39:11.030 --> 01:39:12.295
The last record.

1089
01:39:12.672 --> 01:39:16.479
<i>Captain's Log....
I don't remember the Stardate.</i>


1090
01:39:18.029 --> 01:39:20.395
<i>All distress calls are nonsense.</i>

1091
01:39:21.076 --> 01:39:25.236
<i>Of the crew, only 3 remain.</i>

1092
01:39:25.433 --> 01:39:27.498
<i>I will only die.</i>

1093
01:39:30.072 --> 01:39:33.480
<i>The indiginous race abandoned
this planet long ago.</i>


1094
01:39:33.543 --> 01:39:36.841
<i>They left behind sophisticated
mining equipment</i>


1095
01:39:36.842 --> 01:39:39.220
<i>and a drone platforms.</i>

1096
01:39:39.221 --> 01:39:42.256
<i>They had some sort of technology ...</i>

1097
01:39:42.595 --> 01:39:43.809
<i>That prolongs ...</i>

1098
01:39:44.833 --> 01:39:46.333
<i>Llife.</i>

1099
01:39:46.373 --> 01:39:49.369
<i>I'll do whatever it takes
for me and my crew.</i>


1100
01:39:49.553 --> 01:39:52.578
<i>The Federation do not care about us.</i>

1101
01:39:57.992 --> 01:40:00.493
<i>Probably never see me again ...</i>

1102
01:40:00.822 --> 01:40:02.790
<i>But if you do ...</i>

1103
01:40:03.968 --> 01:40:05.308
<i>Be ready.</i>

1104
01:40:07.042 --> 01:40:08.996
Why has he not
used his weapon yet ?

1105
01:40:09.181 --> 01:40:11.741
Because he wants to find somewhere
to inflict maximum damage.


1106
01:40:11.742 --> 01:40:13.756
He needs a distribution system.

1107
01:40:14.554 --> 01:40:16.047
Circulating area, right ?

1108
01:40:16.048 --> 01:40:18.839
Ay, sir. There's a atmospheric
regulator core.


1109
01:40:18.840 --> 01:40:19.986
Lieutenant, contact Yorktown ...

1110
01:40:19.987 --> 01:40:21.998
Make sure they shut it down
before it finds Krall.


1111
01:40:22.750 --> 01:40:23.885
How we access the core ?

1112
01:40:25.102 --> 01:40:27.596
Well, there is a maintenance tower
at the stations gravitational nexus.


1113
01:40:27.597 --> 01:40:28.671
That's the only way.

1114
01:40:28.672 --> 01:40:30.978
Scotty, get over there and
make sure it gets shutdown.


1115
01:40:31.123 --> 01:40:32.722
Lassie, with me.

1116
01:40:45.907 --> 01:40:48.003
Look, this thing is impossible
to shut down.


1117
01:40:48.226 --> 01:40:49.264
Alright, well.

1118
01:40:51.678 --> 01:40:53.157
Let's see about that.

1119
01:41:00.804 --> 01:41:02.876
Mr. Scott,
why is that thing still on?


1120
01:41:02.911 --> 01:41:05.801
I'm working on that, sir, but as you can imagine
there are a lot of safety protocols, so ...


1121
01:41:05.836 --> 01:41:08.032
Running the thing that you know
keeps everybody alive.


1122
01:41:08.057 --> 01:41:09.356
Figure something out !

1123
01:41:09.381 --> 01:41:12.304
Be careful captain.
A gravity is gonna get a bit screwy ...


1124
01:41:12.351 --> 01:41:13.875
The closer you get to the center.

1125
01:41:14.163 --> 01:41:16.997
Maybe, we should scan the operations schematics.
See if there is a backdoor.


1126
01:41:17.032 --> 01:41:18.456
Lassie, I'm gonna need your eyes.

1127
01:41:36.157 --> 01:41:38.467
What happened when you were out there ...

1128
01:41:38.498 --> 01:41:39.982
Edison.

1129
01:41:41.054 --> 01:41:43.212
Edison ?

1130
01:41:45.740 --> 01:41:48.523
I have to say Kirk.

1131
01:41:49.449 --> 01:41:51.898
I've missed being me.

1132
01:41:53.206 --> 01:41:55.872
We lost ourselve,

1133
01:41:55.919 --> 01:41:57.488
But I gained a purpose.

1134
01:41:57.859 --> 01:42:02.126
It means to bring
the galaxy extra trouble ...


1135
01:42:02.236 --> 01:42:04.761
That makes humanity strong.

1136
01:42:05.185 --> 01:42:07.003
I think you underestimate humanity.

1137
01:42:07.004 --> 01:42:08.836
I fought for humanity !

1138
01:42:09.492 --> 01:42:14.250
We lost millions with the Xindi
and Romulan wars.


1139
01:42:14.320 --> 01:42:15.571
And for what ?

1140
01:42:15.798 --> 01:42:19.170
For the Federation to sit
in the captains chair.


1141
01:42:19.249 --> 01:42:22.412
And ?????? with the enemy ?

1142
01:42:22.798 --> 01:42:25.325
We change. We have to.

1143
01:42:26.276 --> 01:42:29.072
We spend the rest of our lives
fighting the same battles.


1144
01:43:06.178 --> 01:43:07.366
You lost!

1145
01:43:07.652 --> 01:43:09.956
You no way you can
make to get back there.

1146
01:43:13.032 --> 01:43:14.620
You are out.

1147
01:43:15.505 --> 01:43:17.143
Like you did ?

1148
01:43:19.266 --> 01:43:21.307
I read your ship log.

1149
01:43:21.730 --> 01:43:23.946
Captain James T. Kirk.

1150
01:43:23.947 --> 01:43:25.785
At least I know who I am.

1151
01:43:27.191 --> 01:43:28.583
I'm a soldier.

1152
01:43:29.263 --> 01:43:31.792
You won the war, Edison.

1153
01:43:32.208 --> 01:43:33.652
You gave us peace.

1154
01:43:34.472 --> 01:43:35.751
Peace ...

1155
01:43:36.708 --> 01:43:39.082
It's not a world I was born into.

1156
01:43:42.441 --> 01:43:43.634
- Scotty.
- Captain.


1157
01:43:43.659 --> 01:43:47.144
He is using the gravitational slipstream
to get back to the center.


1158
01:44:29.439 --> 01:44:30.490
No !

1159
01:44:40.991 --> 01:44:42.068
Weapon's in the chamber.

1160
01:44:42.103 --> 01:44:43.923
Captain we have to stop
the processor now ...


1161
01:44:43.958 --> 01:44:46.537
Or everything breathing
in Yorktown is dead.


1162
01:44:55.513 --> 01:44:57.959
You can't stop it.

1163
01:44:59.852 --> 01:45:01.405
You will die.

1164
01:45:01.836 --> 01:45:03.828
Better to die saving lives ...

1165
01:45:04.805 --> 01:45:06.467
Than to live with taking them.

1166
01:45:07.883 --> 01:45:09.462
That's what I was born into.

1167
01:45:11.090 --> 01:45:13.431
- Scotty.
- Captain, I think we can redirect it.


1168
01:45:13.466 --> 01:45:15.260
There's a seal construction, perhaps

1169
01:45:15.295 --> 01:45:16.823
That will let you vent
the weapon into space.


1170
01:45:16.858 --> 01:45:20.016
Now we can override the locks, from out here,
but you have to activate the hatch.


1171
01:45:20.041 --> 01:45:22.382
- I just've to hit the button.
- It's not a button, sir.


1172
01:45:22.417 --> 01:45:24.223
It's a simple lever under the white panel.

1173
01:45:25.319 --> 01:45:27.253
- Got it.
- And there's 4 of them.


1174
01:45:28.265 --> 01:45:31.140
Once you have activated lock,
you've to exit the chamber immediately.


1175
01:45:31.165 --> 01:45:33.510
If the hatch is opened when
the processors starts a next cycle ...


1176
01:45:33.545 --> 01:45:35.080
You are gonna get sucked into space.

1177
01:45:35.560 --> 01:45:37.315
What happens if the hatch isn't opened?

1178
01:45:37.340 --> 01:45:39.199
You are gonna get sucked into big fan.

1179
01:45:39.230 --> 01:45:41.159
With the weapon and we all die.

1180
01:45:42.766 --> 01:45:44.778
Dammit, Jim, you won't
make it out on time.

1181
01:45:54.926 --> 01:45:55.689
The vent.

1182
01:45:57.598 --> 01:45:59.335
Get out of there, James T.

1183
01:46:00.645 --> 01:46:02.830
Scotty, the last hatch won't open.

1184
01:46:09.573 --> 01:46:12.260
- Scotty.
- Work fast, Captain. Time is running out.


1185
01:46:12.412 --> 01:46:13.912
He is not gonna make it.

1186
01:47:27.653 --> 01:47:29.713
What would I do without you, Spock ?

1187
01:48:01.965 --> 01:48:05.037
For decades,
the Federation taught that he was a hero.


1188
01:48:05.410 --> 01:48:07.777
I guess time would judge us all.

1189
01:48:09.899 --> 01:48:11.371
He just got lost.

1190
01:48:11.685 --> 01:48:13.944
You saved this entire base, Kirk.

1191
01:48:15.057 --> 01:48:18.107
Millions of souls. Thank you.

1192
01:48:18.463 --> 01:48:21.303
It wasn't just me. Never is.

1193
01:48:21.805 --> 01:48:25.648
Neiter this is easy
position of Vice Admiral, it's yours.


1194
01:48:26.532 --> 01:48:28.449
No one deserves it more.

1195
01:48:31.800 --> 01:48:33.924
Vice Admirals don't fly do they ?

1196
01:48:34.976 --> 01:48:35.999
No.

1197
01:48:36.023 --> 01:48:37.423
They don't.

1198
01:48:39.867 --> 01:48:41.613
No offense, ma'am but ...

1199
01:48:43.302 --> 01:48:44.748
Where's the fun in that ?

1200
01:49:47.122 --> 01:49:49.227
You didn't even try to get
our time up there reduced ?

1201
01:49:49.252 --> 01:49:50.416
Why would I get it reduced ?

1202
01:49:50.441 --> 01:49:53.265
Bones, we know our way
through the nebula now.


1203
01:49:53.489 --> 01:49:54.890
Can you imagine, what we'll find ?

1204
01:49:54.915 --> 01:49:57.432
Alien deathspots,
Calvenom killing us.


1205
01:49:57.531 --> 01:49:59.834
Deadly space worm, viruses and bacteria.

1206
01:49:59.919 --> 01:50:03.864
Incomprehensible cosmic anomalies
that could wipe us out in an instant.


1207
01:50:04.112 --> 01:50:06.230
It's gonna be so much fun.

1208
01:50:07.574 --> 01:50:10.025
By the way, where're we going ?
I thought we were gonna get drink.


1209
01:50:10.283 --> 01:50:12.821
I know you told me to keep it
under wraps, but ...


1210
01:50:12.846 --> 01:50:14.970
Happy birthday !

1211
01:50:17.323 --> 01:50:18.420
Mr. Sensitive ?

1212
01:50:19.853 --> 01:50:21.168
Thanks, Scotty.

1213
01:50:22.849 --> 01:50:26.595
Everybody raise your glass
to Captain James T. Kirk.


1214
01:50:27.159 --> 01:50:28.847
- Captain Kirk.
- Thanks, everybody.


1215
01:50:30.180 --> 01:50:32.472
- To the Enterprise ...
- To the Enterprise.


1216
01:50:32.913 --> 01:50:36.135
And to absent friends.

1217
01:50:38.009 --> 01:50:39.031
Cheers.

1218
01:50:40.643 --> 01:50:43.027
Alright, let's get this party started.

1219
01:50:48.432 --> 01:50:50.452
I thought you have
to finish your mission report.

1220
01:50:51.423 --> 01:50:52.693
I do.

1221
01:50:52.827 --> 01:50:55.834
But I thought it would be more pleasing
to engage with you socialy.


1222
01:50:58.254 --> 01:50:59.948
You're old romantic.

1223
01:51:08.034 --> 01:51:12.264
Do you know that scotch was actually
invented by little lady in Russia ?


1224
01:51:13.888 --> 01:51:15.388
Excuse me.

1225
01:51:17.430 --> 01:51:20.415
Did you drink all those yourself ?
I am impressed.


1226
01:51:21.040 --> 01:51:22.927
Someone said that it
will take my edge off.

1227
01:51:23.830 --> 01:51:25.701
My edge is still not off.

1228
01:51:25.947 --> 01:51:27.513
Alright, gold, maybe this will help.

1229
01:51:29.092 --> 01:51:30.918
Captain pulled a few strings.

1230
01:51:31.304 --> 01:51:34.924
That is acceptance into Starfleet Academy,
if you want to.


1231
01:51:34.980 --> 01:51:37.729
We have a lot rules.
No less, no more.


1232
01:51:37.975 --> 01:51:39.937
Will I have to wear that uniform?

1233
01:51:41.326 --> 01:51:43.015
I'm afraid so.

1234
01:51:45.085 --> 01:51:46.374
Hey, Keenser.

1235
01:51:46.422 --> 01:51:48.537
Kevin, is there no way to wear pants?

1236
01:51:55.491 --> 01:51:57.306
I heard about Ambassador Spock.

1237
01:51:59.528 --> 01:52:01.177
Is that what you wanted to mention...

1238
01:52:01.387 --> 01:52:03.387
...that time in the turbolift?

1239
01:52:05.784 --> 01:52:06.970
More or less.

1240
01:52:09.430 --> 01:52:11.926
I trust your meeting with
Comandant Harris went well.


1241
01:52:15.762 --> 01:52:17.367
More or less.

1242
01:52:25.298 --> 01:52:26.829
You really want to head
back out there, huh?


1243
01:52:54.095 --> 01:52:56.865
Space, the final frontier.

1244
01:52:58.553 --> 01:53:01.539
These are voyagers
of the starship Enterprise.


1245
01:53:02.158 --> 01:53:06.048
It's continuing mission to
explore strange new worlds...


1246
01:53:06.467 --> 01:53:09.859
To seek out new life and
new civilizations ...


1247
01:53:09.926 --> 01:53:15.174
To boldy go where
no one has gone before.
