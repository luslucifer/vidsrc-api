1
00:01:55.576 --> 00:01:59.580
I'm so sorry...
Can you help me? My tire...


2
00:02:00.122 --> 00:02:03.084
Sorry. I have an appointment.
I don't like to be late.


3
00:02:03.251 --> 00:02:04.961
Well, would you rather be late...?

4
00:02:05.086 --> 00:02:06.003
Or dead?

5
00:02:07.713 --> 00:02:08.548
You don't want to do this.

6
00:02:08.714 --> 00:02:09.715
Step out of the car!

7
00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:19.350
Wow!

8
00:02:19.767 --> 00:02:22.812
Let's go fellas. C'mon Babe... Yeah!

9
00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:26.524
Take it easy.
The car's brand new.


10
00:02:26.774 --> 00:02:28.484
No problem, buddy. I got this.

11
00:02:30.736 --> 00:02:32.029
Take a show to the club, baby.

12
00:02:32.154 --> 00:02:34.031
Your parents know the kind of
company you're keeping?


13
00:02:34.156 --> 00:02:34.907
Shut up!

14
00:02:36.909 --> 00:02:38.077
Shitty what command?

15
00:02:38.202 --> 00:02:38.828
It's coded.

16
00:02:38.953 --> 00:02:39.495
What's the code?

17
00:02:39.662 --> 00:02:40.913
I'm afraid I can't give you that.

18
00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:42.373
Well, I'm afraid
we'll have to beat it out of you then.


19
00:02:42.498 --> 00:02:44.458
Get out this car.
Get out the car, nigger.


20
00:02:45.418 --> 00:02:47.670
What you got for me, player.
What you got?


21
00:02:47.795 --> 00:02:49.463
Kick your ass! C'mon baby!

22
00:02:49.755 --> 00:02:50.464
Uh-huh!

23
00:02:51.132 --> 00:02:51.799
Hold on!

24
00:02:53.426 --> 00:02:55.136
It just came out of the dry cleaners.

25
00:03:16.782 --> 00:03:17.450
Hands up!

26
00:03:18.743 --> 00:03:20.620
Stop moving or I'll shoot you!

27
00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:22.163
Don't you have homework to do?

28
00:03:25.374 --> 00:03:26.709
Why don't you go and do it?

29
00:03:27.168 --> 00:03:28.794
OK... I'm sorry.

30
00:03:32.965 --> 00:03:33.758
Late.

31
00:04:44.078 --> 00:04:44.662
Hey... Hey!

32
00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:48.916
The game! The game!
The game! The game!


33
00:04:49.291 --> 00:04:51.585
What's the first rule
when entering a man's car?


34
00:04:52.378 --> 00:04:54.922
Respect a man's car, a man respects you.

35
00:04:55.047 --> 00:04:55.965
Rule number two?

36
00:04:56.215 --> 00:04:59.301
Greet the man. Good afternoon, Frank.

37
00:04:59.468 --> 00:05:00.553
Good afternoon, Jack.

38
00:05:00.678 --> 00:05:01.887
Can we play the game now?

39
00:05:02.013 --> 00:05:04.390
I should think your brain will be
too tired after a whole day of school.


40
00:05:04.557 --> 00:05:06.225
You're just afraid I'm gonna win!

41
00:05:06.392 --> 00:05:08.352
I'm just afraid you're gonna be too
worn out to do your homework.


42
00:05:08.519 --> 00:05:11.022
It's Friday. I don't have any homework.

43
00:05:11.147 --> 00:05:12.565
In that case... The game.

44
00:05:12.732 --> 00:05:13.274
Yes!

45
00:05:13.399 --> 00:05:15.818
But first:
what's the third rule of the car?


46
00:05:17.528 --> 00:05:18.195
Good!

47
00:05:35.129 --> 00:05:36.088
For five points...

48
00:05:36.172 --> 00:05:39.258
I'm white and I'm round.
But I'm not always around.


49
00:05:40.217 --> 00:05:41.260
A tennis ball.

50
00:05:41.635 --> 00:05:42.887
Tennis balls are yellow!

51
00:05:56.609 --> 00:05:57.610
For four points...

52
00:05:58.402 --> 00:06:00.196
Sometimes I'm half, sometimes I'm whole.

53
00:06:00.321 --> 00:06:02.364
Sometimes a slice of me
is all you'll know.


54
00:06:02.448 --> 00:06:03.157
A loaf of bread!

55
00:06:03.282 --> 00:06:03.949
Nope.

56
00:06:09.955 --> 00:06:10.706
For three points...

57
00:06:11.248 --> 00:06:14.126
Sometimes I'm light.
Sometimes I'm dark. Sometimes I'm both.


58
00:06:14.251 --> 00:06:15.294
I know! A light bulb!

59
00:06:15.544 --> 00:06:16.212
Nope.

60
00:06:16.337 --> 00:06:17.213
A pizza!

61
00:06:17.463 --> 00:06:18.130
No.

62
00:07:20.359 --> 00:07:23.112
Audrey, stop walking away from me.

63
00:07:23.487 --> 00:07:25.197
Listen. I got to finish this conversation.

64
00:07:29.118 --> 00:07:29.785
Where's he going?

65
00:07:34.540 --> 00:07:36.834
OK. Look at me. Last clue.
For all the points.


66
00:07:37.126 --> 00:07:41.172
Everyone wants to walk on me,
but only a happy few ever have.


67
00:07:41.881 --> 00:07:42.840
Take your time.

68
00:07:52.224 --> 00:07:52.892
Hey, bud!

69
00:07:53.225 --> 00:07:55.311
Mom, it's the game...
I'm trying to think!


70
00:07:55.436 --> 00:07:56.228
Sorry.

71
00:07:56.562 --> 00:07:57.813
Hey, Frank. How are you today?

72
00:07:57.980 --> 00:07:59.231
Well, Mrs. Billings.

73
00:07:59.398 --> 00:08:01.150
Frank, can I team up with Mom?

74
00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:02.902
I don't know, it's not in the rules.

75
00:08:03.068 --> 00:08:05.863
C'mon, what's the point
having rules you cant beat 'em.


76
00:08:06.780 --> 00:08:08.866
OK. Just this once.

77
00:08:08.991 --> 00:08:09.867
Yeah!

78
00:08:10.159 --> 00:08:11.911
All right. Give me some clues.

79
00:08:12.786 --> 00:08:15.289
It's round but not always around.

80
00:08:15.414 --> 00:08:18.417
It's light sometimes and dark sometimes,
and both sometimes.


81
00:08:18.584 --> 00:08:22.296
Everyone wants to walk on it
but only a happy few ever have.


82
00:08:23.422 --> 00:08:24.465
That is a hard one.

83
00:08:24.673 --> 00:08:26.008
Tell me about it!

84
00:08:30.095 --> 00:08:30.930
The moon!

85
00:08:31.263 --> 00:08:31.805
Correct!

86
00:08:31.931 --> 00:08:34.058
Wow! Good job, good job.

87
00:08:34.266 --> 00:08:35.142
All right, come on.

88
00:08:35.351 --> 00:08:36.227
See you on Monday.

89
00:08:36.352 --> 00:08:37.353
Bye, Frank. Thanks.

90
00:08:37.770 --> 00:08:38.854
Keep your snacks in the kitchen.

91
00:08:38.938 --> 00:08:39.438
Bye, Mom!

92
00:08:39.563 --> 00:08:40.231
Bye, honey.

93
00:08:40.564 --> 00:08:43.651
Hey! He's really taken to you
in the month you've been with us.


94
00:08:43.776 --> 00:08:44.610
Likewise.

95
00:08:44.944 --> 00:08:47.404
It's too bad you can't stay on
after Tony gets back.


96
00:08:47.863 --> 00:08:51.200
It's just a favor.
I don't usually do this sort of job.


97
00:08:51.408 --> 00:08:53.077
I thought you were
a professional driver?


98
00:08:54.662 --> 00:08:56.121
A different kind of driving.

99
00:08:58.916 --> 00:09:00.918
Well, we're all gonna miss you
when you're gone.


100
00:09:09.885 --> 00:09:13.639
And thank you for what you did.

101
00:09:14.181 --> 00:09:14.932
For what?

102
00:09:16.558 --> 00:09:17.601
For turning the car around,

103
00:09:17.685 --> 00:09:19.478
so Jack wouldn't have to
see us fighting.


104
00:09:21.397 --> 00:09:22.606
You really know kids, don't you?

105
00:09:23.691 --> 00:09:24.692
I know fighting.

106
00:09:25.150 --> 00:09:28.696
He hasn't seen Jack in months.
And then when he gets back here,


107
00:09:28.821 --> 00:09:30.990
all I can hear is
what I'm doing wrong?


108
00:09:31.198 --> 00:09:33.993
I would think that after being separated
for a year, that he would...


109
00:09:37.913 --> 00:09:41.333
Sorry, you don't have to hear this.

110
00:09:41.834 --> 00:09:42.710
It's OK.

111
00:09:44.336 --> 00:09:46.797
For what it's worth, I think
you're doing a great job with Jack.


112
00:09:47.798 --> 00:09:48.549
Thank you.

113
00:09:49.258 --> 00:09:52.136
Anytime I can be of help.
If there's anything you need...


114
00:09:52.469 --> 00:09:57.099
It's really sweet of you, Frank.
I might have to take you up on it.


115
00:10:01.103 --> 00:10:02.563
Oh, I almost forgot.

116
00:10:02.688 --> 00:10:06.358
I'm supposed to take Jack to the doctor
tomorrow morning for his annual check up.


117
00:10:06.650 --> 00:10:08.694
But I'm organizing
a surprise party for him.


118
00:10:08.861 --> 00:10:10.738
Even though his birthday
is not until next week.


119
00:10:11.697 --> 00:10:13.657
I just thought it would be nice
since his dad is in town.


120
00:10:14.241 --> 00:10:18.662
So, while I decorate
and his friends arrive I was thinking,


121
00:10:18.829 --> 00:10:19.872
if you wouldn't mind...

122
00:10:20.164 --> 00:10:20.873
I'll take him.

123
00:10:21.165 --> 00:10:22.750
I feel kind of funny
cutting into your weekend.


124
00:10:23.375 --> 00:10:26.086
I'm just picking up a friend
at the airport later on in the day.


125
00:10:26.337 --> 00:10:27.796
Oh, that's nice.

126
00:10:28.130 --> 00:10:28.797
What is?

127
00:10:29.131 --> 00:10:31.258
The guys on security say
you're bit of a loner.


128
00:10:31.800 --> 00:10:34.762
Um... so it's just... It's just nice
to hear you have a friend.


129
00:10:35.054 --> 00:10:38.349
He's not really a friend.
He's French.


130
00:10:40.142 --> 00:10:41.018
I'll call you back.

131
00:10:43.062 --> 00:10:45.647
Audrey, I'd like to
finish our conversation.


132
00:10:51.362 --> 00:10:54.156
Well, if anything comes up
between now and then, you have my cell.


133
00:10:54.365 --> 00:10:55.908
Nothing will come up, Mrs. Billings.

134
00:10:56.450 --> 00:10:57.242
Audrey.

135
00:10:58.660 --> 00:10:59.453
Audrey...

136
00:11:30.275 --> 00:11:30.859
Yeah, hello?

137
00:11:30.943 --> 00:11:31.652
We're confirmed...

138
00:11:31.777 --> 00:11:33.153
for tomorrow. Nine AM.

139
00:12:21.743 --> 00:12:23.829
Tomorrow. Nine AM.
Only change,


140
00:12:23.954 --> 00:12:25.747
the driver will be taking him.
Not the mother.


141
00:12:25.831 --> 00:12:26.832
Even better.

142
00:12:33.505 --> 00:12:34.173
Vassili?

143
00:12:46.435 --> 00:12:47.144
Is it stable?

144
00:12:47.227 --> 00:12:48.687
Yes. It's stable.

145
00:12:48.979 --> 00:12:49.771
And the antidote?

146
00:12:59.364 --> 00:13:00.699
See you tomorrow, gentlemen.

147
00:13:12.753 --> 00:13:16.131
And in other news: The Drug Enforcement
Ministers of six Latin American countries


148
00:13:16.215 --> 00:13:18.634
arrived in Miami today
for a summit meeting.


149
00:13:18.759 --> 00:13:22.095
Yeah. Martin, Frank. 1156 Palmetto.

150
00:13:22.304 --> 00:13:23.889
I'm waiting for an express delivery.

151
00:13:24.515 --> 00:13:26.600
That's what you told me
forty-five minutes ago.


152
00:13:27.434 --> 00:13:30.562
No, I don't need anything else
Just get me the pizza.


153
00:13:32.022 --> 00:13:32.898
I'm not paying for that...

154
00:13:33.315 --> 00:13:33.982
Hi...

155
00:13:35.192 --> 00:13:35.859
Hi!

156
00:13:37.569 --> 00:13:38.403
So, Mr. Martin.

157
00:13:38.529 --> 00:13:42.199
It's one medium pie, no mozzarella,
extra olives and extra anchovies.


158
00:13:42.324 --> 00:13:43.909
Which amounts to eleven ninety five.

159
00:13:44.701 --> 00:13:45.744
I hope you're hungry!

160
00:13:46.245 --> 00:13:47.371
You have no idea...

161
00:13:47.704 --> 00:13:49.206
I apologize for the delay, sir.

162
00:13:52.251 --> 00:13:53.210
Mrs. Billings...

163
00:13:56.255 --> 00:13:57.089
Audrey.

164
00:13:59.967 --> 00:14:00.801
What are you doing?

165
00:14:01.426 --> 00:14:03.178
What does it look like I'm doing?

166
00:14:03.762 --> 00:14:04.763
Audrey. Have you been drinking?

167
00:14:06.265 --> 00:14:06.932
A little.

168
00:14:09.768 --> 00:14:11.353
You said if I needed anything...

169
00:14:12.938 --> 00:14:13.814
I can't.

170
00:14:14.398 --> 00:14:16.608
Why? Because of who I am?

171
00:14:18.277 --> 00:14:19.361
Because of who I am.

172
00:14:30.706 --> 00:14:33.792
I feel so lost... and so confused...

173
00:14:35.627 --> 00:14:36.461
Who isn't?

174
00:14:47.889 --> 00:14:48.974
Thank you, Frank.

175
00:14:51.393 --> 00:14:52.477
For the time, and...

176
00:14:54.313 --> 00:14:55.314
for the respect.

177
00:14:57.316 --> 00:14:59.109
I think it's what I needed the most.

178
00:15:02.237 --> 00:15:02.904
Bye.

179
00:15:36.480 --> 00:15:37.939
Am I gonna get a shot?

180
00:15:38.523 --> 00:15:39.316
I don't know.

181
00:16:02.089 --> 00:16:02.756
Jesus!

182
00:16:03.131 --> 00:16:04.007
We're not open yet.

183
00:16:04.174 --> 00:16:06.968
It's an emergency.
I need to see the doctor immediately.


184
00:16:07.219 --> 00:16:07.803
Right.

185
00:16:08.178 --> 00:16:10.722
Doctor Koblin, if you come out here,
please. We have an issue!


186
00:16:11.640 --> 00:16:14.017
You'll have to fill out some papers
checking the medical problem.


187
00:16:14.226 --> 00:16:16.561
Actually, my problem is not medical.

188
00:16:17.854 --> 00:16:19.022
It's psychological.

189
00:16:19.690 --> 00:16:21.733
Yes, Laura.
What seems to be the problem?


190
00:16:22.359 --> 00:16:22.943
Me!

191
00:16:24.611 --> 00:16:26.071
I hate shots!

192
00:16:27.072 --> 00:16:30.409
Number one, there's no guarantee
you're getting a shot.


193
00:16:31.159 --> 00:16:32.244
So, there's no sense in getting...

194
00:16:32.327 --> 00:16:34.830
all what top over something that
might not happen.


195
00:16:41.420 --> 00:16:42.212
Give me the good news.

196
00:16:42.421 --> 00:16:43.714
Doctor said I'm cured.

197
00:16:44.631 --> 00:16:47.092
Frank, it hurts a lot!

198
00:16:47.217 --> 00:16:48.677
I'll never let anyone hurt you a lot.

199
00:16:48.802 --> 00:16:49.636
Promise?

200
00:16:50.011 --> 00:16:51.096
You know my fourth rule?

201
00:16:51.847 --> 00:16:53.598
Never make a promise you can't keep.

202
00:16:54.891 --> 00:16:55.559
C'mon.

203
00:16:58.103 --> 00:16:58.770
Close the door.

204
00:17:08.655 --> 00:17:09.239
C'mon.

205
00:17:16.580 --> 00:17:17.414
May I help you?

206
00:17:17.831 --> 00:17:19.624
Jack Billings to see Dr. Koblin.

207
00:17:19.750 --> 00:17:22.586
I'm sorry, he's out sick today.
You'll be seeing Dr. Tyberg.


208
00:17:22.711 --> 00:17:24.337
I like Dr. Koblin.

209
00:17:24.463 --> 00:17:26.840
Don't worry, Dr. 
Tyberg's very nice.

210
00:17:26.965 --> 00:17:28.759
Now if you'll just take him
into room three...


211
00:17:29.259 --> 00:17:30.469
Where's Miss Laura?

212
00:17:30.552 --> 00:17:31.052
Who?

213
00:17:31.178 --> 00:17:32.637
You're standing at her desk.

214
00:17:32.804 --> 00:17:36.391
THAT Miss Laura. She's out sick, too.
There's a lots of flu going around.


215
00:17:36.683 --> 00:17:39.019
Now, come on. Doctor's got a busy day.

216
00:17:39.311 --> 00:17:41.354
Come on. It'll be
over before you know it.

217
00:17:43.982 --> 00:17:44.941
Hey!

218
00:17:46.735 --> 00:17:48.278
I'm Dr. Tyberg.

219
00:17:49.321 --> 00:17:50.906
Can't I wait for my doctor?

220
00:17:51.406 --> 00:17:54.743
Unfortunately, your doctor was
called away on an emergency.


221
00:17:54.910 --> 00:17:56.411
Your nurse said he had the flu.

222
00:17:56.661 --> 00:18:00.040
That was the emergency.
He came down with the flu. Very quickly.


223
00:18:00.248 --> 00:18:03.752
So... the sooner we start,
the sooner we'll finish.


224
00:18:04.711 --> 00:18:07.005
Come! I show you something very cool!

225
00:18:08.340 --> 00:18:09.549
Ah! I'm sorry.

226
00:18:09.883 --> 00:18:11.510
Doctor/patient privacy room,

227
00:18:11.593 --> 00:18:14.471
but you can wait in reception area,
or a glass of water, or...


228
00:18:15.388 --> 00:18:16.848
Hey, trust me...

229
00:18:18.266 --> 00:18:19.184
I'm doctor!

230
00:18:19.768 --> 00:18:20.685
Oh, it's phone!

231
00:18:24.940 --> 00:18:25.482
Yeah?

232
00:18:25.857 --> 00:18:28.944
Allo, allo? Frank! I'm here!

233
00:18:29.194 --> 00:18:29.903
You're early.

234
00:18:30.695 --> 00:18:32.030
We had fantastic tailwinds.

235
00:18:32.155 --> 00:18:34.533
Put two hours on my vacation
just like that.


236
00:18:34.950 --> 00:18:38.829
From now on, it's the only way
I fly Frank. Tailwinds or nothing.


237
00:18:39.204 --> 00:18:40.247
I'm glad you made it.

238
00:18:43.291 --> 00:18:43.959
Hello?

239
00:18:45.168 --> 00:18:48.171
Sorry Dr. Dunietz is not in today.
Call back on Monday.


240
00:18:54.469 --> 00:18:55.887
Listen, Inspector.
I'm a little tied up.


241
00:18:56.012 --> 00:18:58.098
You mind taking a cab?
You have the address. Yes?


242
00:18:58.223 --> 00:18:59.558
Oh, thank you.

243
00:19:00.475 --> 00:19:02.727
Oh, you know. I've heard
the fish down here is fantastic.


244
00:19:02.811 --> 00:19:04.062
I could make us a bouillabaisse.

245
00:19:04.354 --> 00:19:05.730
You like bouillabaisse, Frank. No?

246
00:19:08.066 --> 00:19:08.733
I gotta go.

247
00:19:10.569 --> 00:19:11.152
Frank!

248
00:19:11.736 --> 00:19:14.489
You know, maybe it's better to wait
for his regular doctor to come back.


249
00:19:14.656 --> 00:19:17.075
It's very important that
he receives his immunization.


250
00:19:17.242 --> 00:19:19.911
Well, I'm sure it is.
But a week won't make a difference.


251
00:19:20.120 --> 00:19:20.954
No, we're doing now!

252
00:19:43.810 --> 00:19:44.769
Keep going, Jack!

253
00:20:55.966 --> 00:21:00.095
Come here, look at me. Look at me.
Remember my promise?


254
00:21:00.345 --> 00:21:01.012
Yes.

255
00:21:22.826 --> 00:21:23.910
Geah!! It's me!

256
00:21:24.035 --> 00:21:24.744
Get out!

257
00:21:29.416 --> 00:21:30.083
Frank!

258
00:22:01.072 --> 00:22:01.823
Shit!

259
00:22:11.249 --> 00:22:13.752
The patient is not cooperating.
Prep the vehicle.


260
00:22:27.766 --> 00:22:28.433
Go!

261
00:22:29.100 --> 00:22:29.934
Come on! Hurry!

262
00:22:35.857 --> 00:22:37.233
Don't worry. Everything's gonna be OK.

263
00:23:05.678 --> 00:23:06.387
Freeze!

264
00:23:06.596 --> 00:23:07.472
Drop your weapon.

265
00:23:07.972 --> 00:23:09.682
Put your guns on the ground!

266
00:23:10.725 --> 00:23:11.309
Si?

267
00:23:11.434 --> 00:23:12.227
They got away.

268
00:23:13.520 --> 00:23:14.187
God's!

269
00:23:14.521 --> 00:23:15.188
Plan B?

270
00:23:17.524 --> 00:23:18.566
Yes. Plan B.

271
00:23:37.669 --> 00:23:38.628
Oh, you made it!

272
00:23:40.338 --> 00:23:41.464
Oh, what's that?

273
00:23:42.006 --> 00:23:43.216
Jack's birthday present.

274
00:23:43.675 --> 00:23:46.511
Baseball uniform,
cleats, gloves... and a bat.


275
00:23:49.013 --> 00:23:50.098
It's his favorite sport.

276
00:23:50.598 --> 00:23:52.267
It was. Last year.

277
00:23:53.184 --> 00:23:55.728
He's on a soccer team now,
and he's actually really good.


278
00:23:56.187 --> 00:23:57.647
You should see him some time.

279
00:23:57.856 --> 00:23:58.523
Hello?

280
00:23:59.899 --> 00:24:01.776
Mr. and Mrs. Billings, they're coming!

281
00:24:02.694 --> 00:24:04.112
Hide. Everyone hide!

282
00:24:11.536 --> 00:24:12.120
Yes.

283
00:24:12.203 --> 00:24:13.580
Good morning, mister driver.

284
00:24:14.080 --> 00:24:14.831
Who is this?

285
00:24:15.039 --> 00:24:17.250
Look in your rear view mirror
and you'll see who it is.


286
00:24:19.294 --> 00:24:21.713
I know what you're thinking.
Bulletproof glass.


287
00:24:22.213 --> 00:24:23.756
So, now you tell me in your experience,

288
00:24:23.882 --> 00:24:26.301
which, judging from
the little performance...


289
00:24:26.593 --> 00:24:28.469
you put on back at the office,
goes way beyond...


290
00:24:28.553 --> 00:24:30.054
just driving children to school and back.

291
00:24:30.180 --> 00:24:32.056
Does a bulletproof glass stop...

292
00:24:32.182 --> 00:24:34.475
a seven point six two armor
piercing round?


293
00:24:34.642 --> 00:24:37.645
Frank... Why did you stop the car?

294
00:24:40.732 --> 00:24:42.066
Don't bother looking.
They're triangulated...


295
00:24:42.192 --> 00:24:43.484
over a three hundred feet away.

296
00:24:43.693 --> 00:24:44.819
C'mon Frank, pick up!

297
00:24:45.153 --> 00:24:48.072
None of this would have been necessary
if you had not screwed up my plan.


298
00:24:48.323 --> 00:24:50.533
So, now I'm going tell you
how to set things right.


299
00:24:50.700 --> 00:24:52.744
Someone is going to appear
in a few seconds.


300
00:25:06.090 --> 00:25:06.883
Let her in.

301
00:25:15.183 --> 00:25:16.017
Driver?

302
00:25:17.936 --> 00:25:18.603
Good boy.

303
00:25:18.728 --> 00:25:19.437
Good boy.

304
00:25:22.607 --> 00:25:23.942
Ah!

305
00:25:25.610 --> 00:25:26.277
Hi!

306
00:25:27.779 --> 00:25:28.821
Leave it on.

307
00:25:31.991 --> 00:25:34.077
Personally, I hate kids.

308
00:25:34.452 --> 00:25:36.788
Now I don't know what your feelings
are on the subject.


309
00:25:36.955 --> 00:25:38.206
But if you ever want to have any,

310
00:25:38.331 --> 00:25:41.167
make no moves
but the moves I tell you to make.


311
00:25:42.669 --> 00:25:44.504
You're in her hands now, amigo mio.

312
00:25:44.629 --> 00:25:46.005
They can be very gentle hands,

313
00:25:46.256 --> 00:25:47.465
or they can be the hands from hell.

314
00:25:47.674 --> 00:25:48.549
Trust me on this one.

315
00:25:48.716 --> 00:25:49.884
Trust him on this one.

316
00:25:51.386 --> 00:25:52.428
Now, drive.

317
00:26:35.346 --> 00:26:36.014
Take a left.

318
00:26:37.515 --> 00:26:38.391
I said left!

319
00:27:00.371 --> 00:27:01.539
Listen. We keep doing this your way,

320
00:27:01.664 --> 00:27:04.375
no matter how many rights
and lefts we make, they're gonna catch us.


321
00:27:04.667 --> 00:27:06.461
Let me do it my
way, so no one gets hurt.

322
00:27:06.627 --> 00:27:07.545
Where's the fun of that?

323
00:27:07.795 --> 00:27:09.172
Let's save the fun for later.

324
00:29:02.785 --> 00:29:03.536
Not bad!

325
00:29:04.036 --> 00:29:05.913
Did your mother ever teach you
to say thank you?


326
00:29:06.164 --> 00:29:08.332
Yeah! She tried and failed miserably.

327
00:29:09.167 --> 00:29:10.501
Now I think we lost them.

328
00:29:11.335 --> 00:29:12.170
Think again.

329
00:29:17.967 --> 00:29:20.011
Thought complete! Let's go.

330
00:29:49.790 --> 00:29:51.626
What do you mean you can't find him?

331
00:29:51.959 --> 00:29:54.921
He's one man in one car.
He's a chauffeur for Christ's sake!!!


332
00:29:55.046 --> 00:29:56.088
Not exactly sir.

333
00:29:56.380 --> 00:29:58.299
We think there's a possibility
he might be in on it.


334
00:29:58.549 --> 00:29:59.383
It's impossible.

335
00:30:00.134 --> 00:30:01.135
How would you know?

336
00:30:01.511 --> 00:30:02.887
He's been working here for a month.

337
00:30:02.970 --> 00:30:05.389
He could have been setting this up
the whole time and you wouldn't know...


338
00:30:05.681 --> 00:30:08.184
Oh, and you're such
an expert on knowing people!


339
00:30:08.392 --> 00:30:09.101
His background...

340
00:30:11.395 --> 00:30:14.148
He's ex-Special Forces, headed
an elite commando unit for five years.


341
00:30:14.398 --> 00:30:15.816
Specialized in search and destroy.

342
00:30:15.983 --> 00:30:18.236
Been in and out of Lebanon,
Syria, Sudan...


343
00:30:19.070 --> 00:30:19.904
The man is a hunter.

344
00:30:20.154 --> 00:30:22.657
I don't care what his skills are.
I don't care where he's from.


345
00:30:22.823 --> 00:30:25.785
This is not a war zone.
This is an American city!


346
00:30:26.035 --> 00:30:27.119
Where is my son?

347
00:30:56.274 --> 00:30:57.984
Last stop. All out.

348
00:31:01.195 --> 00:31:05.658
You're quite a guy...
Another time. Another place.


349
00:31:05.992 --> 00:31:09.120
You and me, baby.
The pleasure we can have.


350
00:31:15.626 --> 00:31:16.294
Beauty.

351
00:31:18.296 --> 00:31:18.963
Frank...

352
00:31:22.133 --> 00:31:22.967
Frank!

353
00:31:25.386 --> 00:31:26.220
Frank!!!

354
00:31:26.596 --> 00:31:31.392
Not what you expected when you reported
for work this morning, is it Frank. No?


355
00:31:31.976 --> 00:31:34.145
Is that what passes for wit
in this circle?


356
00:31:35.354 --> 00:31:36.731
This circle, my friend.

357
00:31:36.897 --> 00:31:40.610
Wit is not a requirement of the job.
Brutality, yes.


358
00:31:40.901 --> 00:31:42.903
An ability to inflict pain, absolutely.

359
00:31:43.154 --> 00:31:47.658
A certain psychotic moral ignorance.
Blind obedience. All required.


360
00:31:49.160 --> 00:31:50.161
But not wit.

361
00:31:50.286 --> 00:31:50.870
How was it?

362
00:31:50.995 --> 00:31:51.537
Fun.

363
00:31:51.662 --> 00:31:52.830
Only the beginning my love.

364
00:31:55.833 --> 00:31:57.001
What's this all about?

365
00:31:57.668 --> 00:31:59.587
A timely question. Max...

366
00:32:01.172 --> 00:32:02.006
Pardon me.

367
00:32:11.474 --> 00:32:12.099
Hello...

368
00:32:12.224 --> 00:32:15.019
Put me on the speaker, so you don't
have to repeat the instructions.


369
00:32:15.519 --> 00:32:17.855
In the next two hours
you get five million dollars


370
00:32:17.980 --> 00:32:19.482
in non sequential
one hundred dollar bills.


371
00:32:19.649 --> 00:32:21.275
You put them in a water proof suitcase.

372
00:32:21.400 --> 00:32:22.693
You go to the bay front park.

373
00:32:22.902 --> 00:32:25.988
Personally. There will be
a blue Chrysler parked on the side.


374
00:32:26.155 --> 00:32:27.698
You place the suitcase
in the trunk and leave


375
00:32:28.074 --> 00:32:31.202
I don't know if I can get
five million dollars in two hours.


376
00:32:31.535 --> 00:32:33.245
Mr. Billings please.
I read the newspapers.


377
00:32:33.537 --> 00:32:35.498
The day you were appointed
to your current position,


378
00:32:35.665 --> 00:32:38.000
your net worth exceeded
one hundred million dollars.


379
00:32:38.334 --> 00:32:39.710
So, you won't even feel the bite.

380
00:32:40.086 --> 00:32:43.339
What guarantee do I have
that you won't harm my son?


381
00:32:44.548 --> 00:32:47.510
Guarantee? Mr. Billings.
I am not a car dealer.


382
00:32:47.635 --> 00:32:50.680
Don't let the charming accent
and my grammatically impeccable...


383
00:32:50.805 --> 00:32:52.473
syntax mislead you. 
I live in the jungle.

384
00:32:52.598 --> 00:32:55.559
And in the jungle,
you either eat or be eaten.


385
00:32:55.685 --> 00:32:58.229
But in the spirit of doing business,
here is the guarantee.


386
00:32:58.896 --> 00:33:00.314
Ten minutes past the deadline,

387
00:33:00.398 --> 00:33:02.608
if the money doesn't arrive,
I send a finger.


388
00:33:02.817 --> 00:33:03.984
Twenty minutes, a hand.

389
00:33:04.235 --> 00:33:05.236
Thirty minutes, a foot...

390
00:33:07.071 --> 00:33:08.864
Sounds like we have a deal,
don't we, Mr. Billings?


391
00:33:09.323 --> 00:33:10.241
You have a deal.

392
00:33:13.077 --> 00:33:15.788
Could we please speak to our son?

393
00:33:16.914 --> 00:33:19.375
Mommy!!! Mommy!!!!

394
00:33:20.543 --> 00:33:23.462
You have two hours, Mr. Billings.
Starting now.


395
00:33:27.007 --> 00:33:28.426
Jeff, get my son.

396
00:33:28.759 --> 00:33:30.386
All right, all right!

397
00:33:30.511 --> 00:33:34.181
Frank, you promised
you wouldn't let anybody hurt me.


398
00:33:34.432 --> 00:33:35.641
You promised!

399
00:33:36.183 --> 00:33:38.102
Never make promises
you can't keep, my friend.


400
00:33:38.811 --> 00:33:42.106
I don't. It's one of my rules.

401
00:33:43.774 --> 00:33:48.154
Bravo! A man who lives
his life by the rules?


402
00:33:48.446 --> 00:33:50.072
Well, in my world
rules are meant to be broken.


403
00:33:50.448 --> 00:33:51.449
Not mine.

404
00:33:52.032 --> 00:33:53.784
This time you're going
have to make an exception.


405
00:33:54.952 --> 00:33:55.619
Go.

406
00:34:25.399 --> 00:34:26.150
Prego!

407
00:34:39.663 --> 00:34:40.664
Hey, driver!

408
00:34:44.210 --> 00:34:47.213
No, no, wait. A little distance
between us isn't a bad thing.


409
00:34:50.174 --> 00:34:50.841
Endiamo!

410
00:35:00.684 --> 00:35:01.310
Now.

411
00:35:39.557 --> 00:35:40.182
Hello?

412
00:35:40.349 --> 00:35:40.975
It's me.

413
00:35:42.268 --> 00:35:43.561
You, son of a bitch!

414
00:35:43.769 --> 00:35:45.187
Look, I have nothing to do with this.

415
00:35:45.563 --> 00:35:47.439
They have one scratch on his head!
One hair out of place...


416
00:35:47.565 --> 00:35:49.149
Mr. Billings, let me speak
to who's in charge.


417
00:35:49.316 --> 00:35:50.776
Hello Frank.
This is U.S. Marshal Stappleton.


418
00:35:50.901 --> 00:35:52.653
You have to act fast.
There are three boats.


419
00:35:52.778 --> 00:35:53.320
Crankies...

420
00:35:53.445 --> 00:35:54.363
Just tell us where you are.

421
00:35:54.530 --> 00:35:56.574
Get a plane up, over the antic coast.
They're heading north.


422
00:35:56.699 --> 00:35:57.533
Just tell me where you are, Frank.

423
00:35:57.658 --> 00:35:58.784
Just tell us where you are!

424
00:36:00.119 --> 00:36:00.828
Hello, Frank!

425
00:36:02.246 --> 00:36:02.830
Got it!

426
00:36:32.610 --> 00:36:33.277
Hello?

427
00:36:33.444 --> 00:36:35.029
Tarconi, it's me. 
Get out of the house.

428
00:36:35.237 --> 00:36:37.448
Oh no... I was just putting
the madeleines in.


429
00:36:37.740 --> 00:36:39.450
Forget the madeleines. Just get out.

430
00:36:39.658 --> 00:36:40.367
And go where?

431
00:36:40.451 --> 00:36:40.951
Anywhere.

432
00:36:41.076 --> 00:36:42.119
The beach. Go to the beach.

433
00:36:42.411 --> 00:36:45.831
Ah, the beach.. 
The famous Miami beach.

434
00:36:45.998 --> 00:36:49.126
Oh, my dream.
I would love to go to the beach.


435
00:36:53.422 --> 00:36:54.131
Maybe not.

436
00:36:55.257 --> 00:36:56.967
Freeze! Who the fuck are you?

437
00:36:57.927 --> 00:36:58.802
I'm the cook.

438
00:37:02.097 --> 00:37:04.350
That's a mistake...
That's a terrible mistake!


439
00:37:06.393 --> 00:37:10.898
Why we can't all
just get along, you know?

440
00:37:26.872 --> 00:37:27.539
Hello?

441
00:37:27.915 --> 00:37:29.249
It's Frank. Don't hang up.

442
00:37:29.375 --> 00:37:30.334
Pretend it's someone else.

443
00:37:33.379 --> 00:37:34.129
Hi Susan...

444
00:37:36.340 --> 00:37:37.675
No, I'm just here at home.

445
00:37:38.175 --> 00:37:41.470
I didn't do it, Audrey.
She had a gun on Jack. I had no choice.


446
00:37:41.804 --> 00:37:43.722
Yeah, I saw that.

447
00:37:45.349 --> 00:37:46.183
What do you know?

448
00:37:46.392 --> 00:37:47.518
It's more than a kidnapping.

449
00:37:47.726 --> 00:37:49.186
They called and asked for a ransom!

450
00:37:49.395 --> 00:37:51.939
The doctor there was fake.
And they tried to get Jack a shot.


451
00:37:52.189 --> 00:37:53.315
When I interrupted them...

452
00:37:57.319 --> 00:38:00.114
Audrey, I promised Jack
I wouldn't let anyone hurt him.


453
00:38:00.614 --> 00:38:02.032
I'm not gonna break that promise.

454
00:38:03.325 --> 00:38:04.034
I'll call you back.

455
00:38:07.871 --> 00:38:08.539
Audrey?

456
00:38:10.332 --> 00:38:11.291
Is everything alright?

457
00:38:12.042 --> 00:38:15.295
It's a pretty stupid question
to ask right now, don't you think, Jeff?


458
00:38:22.970 --> 00:38:26.473
All right. So tell me again,
Inspector Tarconi...


459
00:38:27.266 --> 00:38:31.061
Why you didn't immediately
identify yourself as a police officer?


460
00:38:33.564 --> 00:38:37.735
I was overwhelmed
by the effectiveness of your operation.


461
00:38:38.610 --> 00:38:40.738
The sophistication of your equipment.

462
00:38:40.946 --> 00:38:44.700
You know, I work in a small office
in a small town.


463
00:38:44.783 --> 00:38:46.618
We only have small crimes.

464
00:38:46.744 --> 00:38:48.245
I must admit I was a little insecure...

465
00:38:48.370 --> 00:38:50.622
And you and Frank Martin
are friends, right?


466
00:38:50.789 --> 00:38:54.251
A friend? I wouldn't say exactly a friend.

467
00:38:54.418 --> 00:38:56.837
I know him. We have a relationship.

468
00:38:56.962 --> 00:38:58.505
A long relationship?

469
00:38:58.756 --> 00:38:59.840
Not so long.

470
00:38:59.965 --> 00:39:01.884
But they found you cooking in his house.

471
00:39:02.009 --> 00:39:02.760
I'm French.

472
00:39:02.885 --> 00:39:03.385
So?!

473
00:39:03.510 --> 00:39:06.513
We don't need to know someone
for a long time in order to cook for them.


474
00:39:06.638 --> 00:39:08.557
That's our way of breaking the ice.

475
00:39:08.766 --> 00:39:10.059
Take, for example, you.

476
00:39:10.225 --> 00:39:13.729
This sandwich and coffee
you have so graciously offered me.


477
00:39:13.854 --> 00:39:17.024
You will pardon me for to say so,
but it is not very good.


478
00:39:17.316 --> 00:39:20.069
Yeah, I know. It sucks, but...
What does that got to do with anything?


479
00:39:20.402 --> 00:39:21.487
Do you have a kitchen?

480
00:40:51.410 --> 00:40:52.202
Don't move!

481
00:40:52.786 --> 00:40:53.453
Smith!

482
00:40:54.454 --> 00:40:55.205
Drop it!

483
00:41:34.453 --> 00:41:35.704
Are you sure this is safe?

484
00:41:35.871 --> 00:41:38.415
Look over your shoulder.
We got you covered.


485
00:41:48.926 --> 00:41:50.802
As my mother used to say,

486
00:41:50.928 --> 00:41:55.349
a meal is only limited
by your imagination.


487
00:41:56.099 --> 00:41:57.684
That's creme brulee, and croque monsieur.

488
00:41:57.809 --> 00:41:58.602
Creme brulee?

489
00:41:58.769 --> 00:41:59.394
Creme brulee

490
00:42:00.145 --> 00:42:00.729
Croque monsieur.

491
00:42:00.812 --> 00:42:01.772
Croque monsieur.

492
00:42:04.316 --> 00:42:04.983
Oui?

493
00:42:05.234 --> 00:42:05.943
Where are you?

494
00:42:06.443 --> 00:42:07.110
Cooking.

495
00:42:07.277 --> 00:42:09.780
Cooking. Can you talk?

496
00:42:10.530 --> 00:42:12.032
Speak of the Devil. My mother.

497
00:42:12.157 --> 00:42:12.658
Mom!

498
00:42:12.783 --> 00:42:14.451
Heu... please! Heu...

499
00:42:14.868 --> 00:42:17.454
Do you mind? Thank you.

500
00:42:18.330 --> 00:42:20.374
Oui maman,
oui oui j'suis tres bien arrive.


501
00:42:20.457 --> 00:42:22.501
Oui, tres tres bien merci.

502
00:42:22.876 --> 00:42:24.461
Ah oui c'est une tres jolie ville... oui,

503
00:42:24.586 --> 00:42:25.087
oh la la!

504
00:42:25.170 --> 00:42:26.713
May I ask who you are cooking for?

505
00:42:26.922 --> 00:42:28.382
For the U.S. Marshals.

506
00:42:29.049 --> 00:42:32.010
Once they found my badge
they were very polite.


507
00:42:32.177 --> 00:42:33.804
They gave me a coffee and a sandwich.

508
00:42:34.471 --> 00:42:37.182
You wouldn't believe what passes
for food in this place, Frank.


509
00:42:37.307 --> 00:42:39.017
But I'm correcting the situation...

510
00:42:39.393 --> 00:42:42.145
while they wait for my chief
to call back and confirm everything.


511
00:42:42.938 --> 00:42:46.900
Of course, that might take a while.
He's never there.


512
00:42:47.901 --> 00:42:48.652
Anything about me?

513
00:42:48.777 --> 00:42:52.698
Yes, they're very interested about you.
They want to know where you are.


514
00:42:54.658 --> 00:42:55.325
Where are you?

515
00:42:55.575 --> 00:42:57.494
Nowhere for very long. 
Listen, hold on.

516
00:43:02.833 --> 00:43:04.251
Do you have access to a computer?

517
00:43:05.502 --> 00:43:08.171
Easier than having access
to something decent to eat.


518
00:43:25.063 --> 00:43:26.023
Handsome fellow.

519
00:43:26.189 --> 00:43:26.857
Who is he?

520
00:43:27.357 --> 00:43:28.150
That's what I need to know.

521
00:43:28.317 --> 00:43:29.192
Do they have an ID program...

522
00:43:29.318 --> 00:43:32.279
You'll forgive me,
but I am not so used to this system.


523
00:43:32.404 --> 00:43:35.157
Back home there is
one computer for ten of us.


524
00:43:35.365 --> 00:43:37.701
So how is it with you, Frank?

525
00:43:37.826 --> 00:43:39.244
It's a complicated story.

526
00:43:39.536 --> 00:43:41.121
Ah, You mean you are in the shit.

527
00:43:41.538 --> 00:43:42.456
You might say that.

528
00:43:42.914 --> 00:43:44.708
In other words, your natural state.

529
00:43:46.793 --> 00:43:50.380
Ah, voila!
A Russian virologist with advanced...


530
00:43:50.505 --> 00:43:54.009
degrees from the State laboratory
for Biological Warfare in Siberia.


531
00:43:54.176 --> 00:43:54.968
We have an address?

532
00:43:55.260 --> 00:43:59.139
Miami, Park West,
King Street, number eleven.


533
00:46:16.359 --> 00:46:17.486
What are you doing?

534
00:46:17.819 --> 00:46:18.862
Trying to catch a bus.

535
00:46:40.133 --> 00:46:43.386
What are you doing, driver?
Not so good on the water!


536
00:47:20.632 --> 00:47:21.883
OK, OK.

537
00:47:22.050 --> 00:47:23.385
Tell me about the doctor's office.

538
00:47:23.552 --> 00:47:24.261
What doctor's office?

539
00:47:24.386 --> 00:47:26.763
The one where you tried
to stick the kids with this.


540
00:47:27.389 --> 00:47:28.098
You wanna tell me?

541
00:47:38.733 --> 00:47:39.859
Do you know what you have done?

542
00:47:40.902 --> 00:47:42.153
Do you know what you have done?

543
00:47:42.404 --> 00:47:44.948
Obviously something not conducing
to your good health.


544
00:47:45.156 --> 00:47:47.200
Which is all I needed
to know in the first place.


545
00:47:47.742 --> 00:47:48.618
Have a good life.

546
00:47:50.453 --> 00:47:51.288
What's left of it...

547
00:48:00.505 --> 00:48:03.425
What's going on, here?
That way, that way.


548
00:48:07.637 --> 00:48:09.055
Outpost to Base, the ransom...

549
00:48:09.180 --> 00:48:09.973
is still there.

550
00:48:12.350 --> 00:48:13.435
The ransom still hasn't been picked up.

551
00:48:13.602 --> 00:48:14.227
What does that mean?

552
00:48:14.352 --> 00:48:15.478
Don't worry, right now
it means nothing yet.


553
00:48:15.604 --> 00:48:17.147
And what if it's not just a kidnapping?

554
00:48:17.272 --> 00:48:19.691
Ma'am I've worked on fifteen
kidnapping cases in the past two years.


555
00:48:19.816 --> 00:48:22.485
And you think that if they don't take
the ransom, I'm gonna get my son back?


556
00:48:22.611 --> 00:48:25.447
Audrey, don't make this anymore
complicated than it already is.


557
00:48:25.739 --> 00:48:28.325
I'm not making this complicated,
Jefferson.


558
00:48:28.658 --> 00:48:29.743
It's because of your job!

559
00:48:29.868 --> 00:48:31.620
What does my job
has to do with any of this?


560
00:48:31.828 --> 00:48:33.413
It has everything to do with it.

561
00:48:33.997 --> 00:48:36.082
Don't you understand
because you became famous,


562
00:48:36.207 --> 00:48:37.334
we became the targets?

563
00:48:37.459 --> 00:48:39.169
And no matter what
any of you all think...

564
00:48:39.294 --> 00:48:41.588
the only one who is out trying
to get Jack back is Frank!


565
00:48:42.005 --> 00:48:44.215
Frank? The chauffeur?

566
00:48:44.507 --> 00:48:45.925
You spoke to Frank Martin,
and didn't tell us about it


567
00:48:46.009 --> 00:48:47.469
What the hell are you doing
talking to him.


568
00:48:47.636 --> 00:48:50.180
Because he's the last person
who saw Jack alive.


569
00:48:51.890 --> 00:48:52.641
We found the boy!

570
00:49:19.959 --> 00:49:20.669
It's shut down.

571
00:49:20.752 --> 00:49:21.461
The hard drive blew.

572
00:49:21.711 --> 00:49:22.545
Get another one in here!

573
00:49:22.921 --> 00:49:23.588
Yes, sir.

574
00:49:23.713 --> 00:49:25.548
How long is it going to take?

575
00:49:25.674 --> 00:49:27.342
Ma'am, we're going as fast as we can!

576
00:49:27.509 --> 00:49:29.052
He can suffocate in there!

577
00:49:29.219 --> 00:49:29.969
Ma'am, stay calm.

578
00:49:30.053 --> 00:49:30.887
It's my son!

579
00:49:31.012 --> 00:49:32.097
Audrey! Let them work!

580
00:49:32.305 --> 00:49:33.640
Are you just going to
sit there and do nothing!


581
00:49:33.890 --> 00:49:35.225
Audrey, they're experts!

582
00:49:35.433 --> 00:49:37.769
Everyone's an expert!
I've had it with all of you!


583
00:49:39.354 --> 00:49:39.896
Audrey!

584
00:49:40.939 --> 00:49:41.815
Hey, hey hey!!

585
00:49:47.153 --> 00:49:47.904
Audrey!

586
00:49:57.247 --> 00:49:58.456
Mommy!

587
00:50:02.085 --> 00:50:02.877
Jack!

588
00:50:04.796 --> 00:50:05.630
Are you OK?

589
00:50:12.053 --> 00:50:13.221
There you go, little buddy.

590
00:50:19.102 --> 00:50:21.062
Breathe. C'mon, breathe.

591
00:50:22.397 --> 00:50:23.273
You're the devil!

592
00:50:23.940 --> 00:50:24.774
I wish...

593
00:51:02.103 --> 00:51:02.771
Tipov.

594
00:51:03.772 --> 00:51:07.525
Shhiiiit! Dmitri!
You scared shittin' me!


595
00:51:07.650 --> 00:51:08.318
Where's Sonovitch?

596
00:51:08.485 --> 00:51:09.152
He's in chamber.

597
00:51:09.277 --> 00:51:09.986
I need to speak with him.

598
00:51:10.111 --> 00:51:10.779
He won't be long.

599
00:51:11.321 --> 00:51:12.322
Sit down!

600
00:51:13.031 --> 00:51:15.867
Listen Panasonic...
It's rock music, it's good.


601
00:52:55.758 --> 00:52:56.384
What was it?

602
00:52:56.509 --> 00:52:57.218
I don't know...

603
00:52:59.012 --> 00:52:59.596
Shit!

604
00:53:00.847 --> 00:53:01.514
What are you doing here?

605
00:53:01.681 --> 00:53:05.518
I need the antidote! The driver!
He injected me with the virus! Look!


606
00:53:06.561 --> 00:53:08.313
Dmitri. Where would he get the virus...?

607
00:53:08.521 --> 00:53:10.648
The one we left in doctor's surgery!

608
00:53:11.065 --> 00:53:13.276
Please, I need the antidote! I'm sick!

609
00:53:13.443 --> 00:53:15.111
Calm down. You're not sick.

610
00:53:15.403 --> 00:53:17.989
You have four hours
before the virus is active.


611
00:53:18.114 --> 00:53:19.908
You know that. 
You worked on creating it.

612
00:53:21.826 --> 00:53:22.535
Open the fridge.

613
00:53:23.244 --> 00:53:24.037
Open the fridge.

614
00:53:25.663 --> 00:53:27.749
Please Venisia, open the fridge.

615
00:53:28.041 --> 00:53:28.750
Open the fridge.

616
00:53:30.919 --> 00:53:34.464
Yes... insurance policy.
How many do you have?


617
00:53:34.589 --> 00:53:37.342
Two doses. Enough for Tipov and myself.

618
00:53:41.429 --> 00:53:44.098
Tipov's policy's been canceled.
There's one for me!


619
00:53:45.558 --> 00:53:47.185
And I want it now! C'mon.

620
00:53:47.977 --> 00:53:48.645
Come on!

621
00:53:49.979 --> 00:53:50.688
Let's do it!

622
00:53:53.358 --> 00:53:54.150
Let's not.

623
00:53:54.275 --> 00:53:54.776
Who are you?

624
00:53:54.943 --> 00:53:56.319
Driver! There's enough for two of us.

625
00:53:56.444 --> 00:53:57.111
You don't need it.

626
00:53:57.236 --> 00:53:58.363
You injected me!

627
00:53:58.529 --> 00:53:59.197
With water.

628
00:54:00.031 --> 00:54:00.990
I'm not sick?!

629
00:54:01.616 --> 00:54:02.575
Not sick.

630
00:54:02.742 --> 00:54:03.326
Water?

631
00:54:03.451 --> 00:54:04.077
Water.

632
00:54:06.120 --> 00:54:07.080
You, son of a bitch!

633
00:54:12.335 --> 00:54:15.630
Good. Our problem is solved.
One dose for each of us.


634
00:54:15.797 --> 00:54:16.589
It's not for us.

635
00:54:16.756 --> 00:54:20.843
Ah, one for you, one for the child.
Your devotion is touching.


636
00:54:20.969 --> 00:54:22.595
And my patience is about run out.

637
00:54:29.978 --> 00:54:31.145
Tell me about the virus.

638
00:54:31.437 --> 00:54:33.356
OK. What would you want to know?

639
00:54:33.523 --> 00:54:35.024
Everything. For starters, what is it?

640
00:54:35.191 --> 00:54:38.277
It's a recombinant retro immune
double polymorphing effluent.


641
00:54:38.695 --> 00:54:43.199
The child will die. Anyone he breathes on
will die. And then it's over.


642
00:54:43.324 --> 00:54:44.367
What do you mean, it's over?

643
00:54:44.534 --> 00:54:47.996
The virus is designed
to go inert after 24 hours.


644
00:54:48.121 --> 00:54:48.997
Thanks for the lesson.

645
00:54:50.456 --> 00:54:51.332
Now give me the vials.

646
00:54:52.083 --> 00:54:54.544
You really want to play
super hero, don't you?


647
00:54:56.087 --> 00:54:57.422
Well, let's see if you can fly.

648
00:55:34.250 --> 00:55:34.959
Are you OK?

649
00:55:35.460 --> 00:55:36.169
I'm OK.

650
00:56:41.150 --> 00:56:42.568
There is nothing to worry about.

651
00:56:42.819 --> 00:56:44.695
It's just a simple viral infection...

652
00:56:44.821 --> 00:56:46.614
combined with the stress of
what happened.


653
00:56:46.697 --> 00:56:49.992
It should pass in a day or two.
I gave him something to help him sleep.


654
00:56:50.576 --> 00:56:51.828
Call me if anything arises.

655
00:56:52.995 --> 00:56:53.830
Thank you doctor.

656
00:56:56.582 --> 00:56:58.126
You know... Audrey...

657
00:56:59.085 --> 00:57:03.172
All this is... well it's made me realize
what a fool I've been...


658
00:57:04.549 --> 00:57:08.136
with Jack... and with you.

659
00:57:12.223 --> 00:57:13.015
Are you OK?

660
00:57:14.016 --> 00:57:15.476
Mr. Billings. We're running late.

661
00:57:17.270 --> 00:57:18.146
I'll be right out!

662
00:57:19.355 --> 00:57:21.774
I'd like to come by after the conference.

663
00:57:22.775 --> 00:57:26.612
Check on Jack. Check on you.

664
00:57:30.199 --> 00:57:32.493
Good. I'll see you soon.

665
00:57:33.619 --> 00:57:34.829
They're here if you need them.

666
00:57:47.925 --> 00:57:48.676
You alright ma'am?

667
00:57:49.468 --> 00:57:50.261
I'm fine.

668
00:57:54.891 --> 00:57:55.558
Hello?

669
00:57:55.725 --> 00:57:56.434
It's me.

670
00:57:57.935 --> 00:57:58.895
Are you OK, Mrs. Billings?

671
00:57:59.020 --> 00:57:59.770
Go to your bedroom.

672
00:57:59.896 --> 00:58:02.273
Hi Susan. How are you?

673
00:58:04.817 --> 00:58:07.361
I'm alone. Where are you, Frank?

674
00:58:08.112 --> 00:58:08.779
Turn around.

675
00:58:20.833 --> 00:58:24.503
Frank, you were wrong.
It was a kidnapping. Jack is fine.


676
00:58:24.670 --> 00:58:26.714
Jack's been infected
with a deadly virus, Audrey.


677
00:58:27.048 --> 00:58:29.425
Now, anyone who comes
into contact with him will die.


678
00:58:30.092 --> 00:58:31.177
What are you telling me...?

679
00:58:33.012 --> 00:58:34.931
Are you telling me
that my son's gonna die?


680
00:58:35.765 --> 00:58:36.724
No he's not!

681
00:58:39.769 --> 00:58:41.604
Once incubated
the virus becomes airborne,


682
00:58:42.021 --> 00:58:43.981
so anyone he breathes on
gets infected.


683
00:58:44.106 --> 00:58:46.609
The son is the weapon.
The target is his father.


684
00:58:47.026 --> 00:58:49.070
Jefferson? But why?

685
00:58:49.528 --> 00:58:52.156
Because of the conference.
It's the only logical answer.


686
00:58:52.573 --> 00:58:55.243
The Drugs Enforcement Agency
in the hemisphere in one room.


687
00:58:55.618 --> 00:58:57.286
Your husband breathes, the room dies.

688
00:59:02.124 --> 00:59:03.125
Oh please...

689
00:59:04.710 --> 00:59:06.003
You gotta trust me, Audrey...

690
00:59:14.345 --> 00:59:15.221
Can you get to him?

691
00:59:17.056 --> 00:59:17.932
What are you gonna do?

692
00:59:18.224 --> 00:59:21.227
Find the guy responsible.
He has more of this.


693
00:59:22.520 --> 00:59:23.562
For you and everybody else.

694
00:59:25.648 --> 00:59:26.399
For you now.

695
00:59:44.333 --> 00:59:45.167
We have a guest.

696
00:59:47.211 --> 00:59:48.129
You're burning up.

697
00:59:50.756 --> 00:59:52.008
Look, you gotta go. Go!

698
00:59:56.137 --> 00:59:56.887
Don't move!

699
01:00:42.725 --> 01:00:43.559
Is the governor here?

700
01:00:43.684 --> 01:00:45.186
Everybody's gonna be here:

701
01:00:45.269 --> 01:00:47.897
the governor... delegate...
from all of the world...


702
01:00:49.899 --> 01:00:50.566
Hello?

703
01:00:50.816 --> 01:00:52.068
You can't go to the conference.

704
01:00:52.234 --> 01:00:52.985
Is everything all right?

705
01:00:53.069 --> 01:00:54.153
They kidnapped Jack...

706
01:00:54.278 --> 01:00:55.696
to give him a deadly virus.

707
01:00:55.863 --> 01:00:57.198
Audrey, I can't hear you,
I'm inside...


708
01:00:57.490 --> 01:00:58.991
Now I got it in sort of you.

709
01:00:59.200 --> 01:01:00.368
Audrey, I can't hear you.

710
01:01:00.576 --> 01:01:02.244
Their plan is to infect
everyone at the conference.


711
01:01:02.828 --> 01:01:04.121
I mean I have to call you back.

712
01:01:04.288 --> 01:01:04.789
Jeff!

713
01:01:07.833 --> 01:01:08.793
Mr. Billings, you're all right?

714
01:01:11.212 --> 01:01:12.088
I'm all right, c'mon let's go.

715
01:01:12.213 --> 01:01:12.880
You're sure.

716
01:01:35.069 --> 01:01:35.736
Allo?

717
01:01:36.153 --> 01:01:37.530
Are you still a guest of the government?

718
01:01:38.364 --> 01:01:40.533
They gave me the five star accommodation.

719
01:01:41.784 --> 01:01:42.493
Let me guess,

720
01:01:42.660 --> 01:01:43.494
you need my help.

721
01:01:43.619 --> 01:01:44.703
Are you near the computer?

722
01:01:46.122 --> 01:01:47.706
It's practically my pillow.

723
01:01:48.124 --> 01:01:49.750
So! Where do you want to start?

724
01:01:49.875 --> 01:01:51.001
I don't know. I have nothing.

725
01:01:51.168 --> 01:01:55.047
Ah! My favorite type of investigation.

726
01:01:56.632 --> 01:01:57.341
Let's see.

727
01:01:58.717 --> 01:01:59.385
Alors...

728
01:02:00.261 --> 01:02:03.431
I'd like to take this opportunity to
introduce you to my delegate...


729
01:02:03.556 --> 01:02:06.642
Breathe. That's right.
Breathe, my friend. Breathe.


730
01:02:08.519 --> 01:02:09.228
Tomorrow,

731
01:02:10.062 --> 01:02:11.814
once these bastards are out of the way,

732
01:02:11.897 --> 01:02:14.233
and their cooperation agreements
are dead and buried.


733
01:02:15.276 --> 01:02:17.027
You know what the biggest problem
is going to be?


734
01:02:17.361 --> 01:02:18.028
What?

735
01:02:18.195 --> 01:02:19.280
Counting the money.

736
01:02:24.535 --> 01:02:26.162
I can't wait for tomorrow.

737
01:02:26.328 --> 01:02:27.329
Aie aie Aie!!

738
01:02:28.914 --> 01:02:30.082
Ah, it's easy with you...

739
01:02:31.834 --> 01:02:33.169
Ah!

740
01:02:33.627 --> 01:02:34.920
Gianni Chellini.

741
01:02:35.087 --> 01:02:37.548
He hires himself out to anyone
looking to make trouble.


742
01:02:37.673 --> 01:02:39.884
Like the Red Brigades, the Shining Path...

743
01:02:42.094 --> 01:02:44.513
Someone access the data base
on the fifteenth floor...


744
01:02:45.890 --> 01:02:48.434
That's Gonzalez! 
He's on vacation!

745
01:02:50.060 --> 01:02:54.190
He was behind the hostage taking
of the OPEC ministers in Geneva.


746
01:02:55.733 --> 01:02:57.485
That was a nice piece of work!

747
01:03:02.198 --> 01:03:03.032
Give me an address?

748
01:03:03.199 --> 01:03:05.534
Miami, Tiland, 
Pelican drive number...

749
01:03:05.701 --> 01:03:06.702
twenty six nine hundred.

750
01:03:06.869 --> 01:03:07.870
We found the car!

751
01:03:08.120 --> 01:03:09.121
You're one great cop, Tarconi.

752
01:03:09.955 --> 01:03:11.290
Thank you for the compliment.

753
01:03:11.707 --> 01:03:13.501
Now I am going back to sleep.

754
01:03:17.338 --> 01:03:19.048
Mmm... maybe not.

755
01:03:21.425 --> 01:03:23.719
Wow, ma car, man! 
Move off the witch!

756
01:03:23.886 --> 01:03:24.637
Move over!

757
01:03:27.306 --> 01:03:29.308
This is the second car.

758
01:03:29.725 --> 01:03:32.144
And if anything armed it,
I'm gonna be out of a job,


759
01:03:32.353 --> 01:03:34.063
out of a house
and out of a wife.

760
01:03:34.980 --> 01:03:35.898
Mommy...

761
01:03:38.275 --> 01:03:40.236
Honey... are you feeling better?

762
01:03:40.402 --> 01:03:41.570
A little bit.

763
01:03:43.030 --> 01:03:44.990
Why don't you try to
go back to sleep, OK?


764
01:03:51.997 --> 01:03:53.582
Ma'am! Are you alright?

765
01:04:04.593 --> 01:04:06.971
Jefferson? Jefferson, you're OK?

766
01:05:12.161 --> 01:05:13.037
OK, do it.

767
01:05:26.800 --> 01:05:27.676
What are you doing?

768
01:05:28.344 --> 01:05:30.012
You know, last night got me thinking:

769
01:05:31.180 --> 01:05:33.515
how do we transport the antidote safely?

770
01:05:33.766 --> 01:05:35.225
We need something that won't break,

771
01:05:35.768 --> 01:05:37.186
something that can't be stolen,

772
01:05:37.519 --> 01:05:39.021
something totally secure.

773
01:05:40.606 --> 01:05:41.273
Me.

774
01:05:47.780 --> 01:05:48.822
Impressive!

775
01:05:49.615 --> 01:05:50.532
Get dressed.

776
01:05:52.951 --> 01:05:53.452
Stop him.

777
01:05:56.664 --> 01:05:57.373
These your friends?

778
01:05:58.290 --> 01:05:58.957
Not yet...

779
01:06:08.801 --> 01:06:09.551
Where'd they go?

780
01:06:10.469 --> 01:06:11.387
The garage.

781
01:06:13.472 --> 01:06:14.348
I'm out of ammo.

782
01:06:14.556 --> 01:06:15.224
Me too.

783
01:06:15.808 --> 01:06:16.767
Where are the reloads?

784
01:06:17.393 --> 01:06:18.227
The garage...

785
01:06:20.104 --> 01:06:21.814
Check out! Go, go, go!

786
01:06:26.735 --> 01:06:27.945
Forget the ammo. Get him!

787
01:08:22.184 --> 01:08:23.101
What do you want me to do?

788
01:08:24.061 --> 01:08:25.187
Keep the meter running.

789
01:08:25.854 --> 01:08:26.522
Bye!

790
01:08:27.773 --> 01:08:31.026
Don't worry, baby.
You're safe now. You're safe.


791
01:08:31.151 --> 01:08:35.197
You're so beautiful... You remind me
of my yellow pum pum rider.


792
01:09:51.607 --> 01:09:52.274
Don't move!

793
01:09:53.775 --> 01:09:54.985
Ah, Mr. driver!

794
01:09:55.235 --> 01:09:56.612
I'll blow you into tomorrow.

795
01:09:57.029 --> 01:09:58.780
But then I'd bleed
what you came for all over the floor...


796
01:09:58.906 --> 01:10:00.532
and you wouldn't want this, would you...?

797
01:10:01.116 --> 01:10:03.619
Not after you worked so hard
trying to get to the antidote.


798
01:10:05.037 --> 01:10:06.288
Take a good look, Frank Martin.

799
01:10:07.664 --> 01:10:10.876
I am a cure for what ails you.
I'm the ONLY cure for what ails you.


800
01:10:11.501 --> 01:10:12.794
I am the antidote.

801
01:10:14.880 --> 01:10:16.340
But, nice try. 
I'm impressed.

802
01:10:16.506 --> 01:10:18.133
I didn't give you enough credit.

803
01:10:18.300 --> 01:10:20.093
Took more than a driver
to figure this out.


804
01:10:20.844 --> 01:10:22.220
I haven't figured it all out yet.

805
01:10:22.429 --> 01:10:23.972
Perhaps I can help you.
What part are you a little...


806
01:10:24.056 --> 01:10:25.015
What you say...

807
01:10:25.140 --> 01:10:25.974
Thick on?

808
01:10:26.266 --> 01:10:28.310
You. Why?

809
01:10:28.477 --> 01:10:32.981
Oh. That's the easy part.
It's a business deal. Pure and simple.


810
01:10:33.565 --> 01:10:35.567
I'm for hire to the highest bidder.

811
01:10:35.984 --> 01:10:39.154
And in this case, the highest bidder
was the Colombian Cocaine Cartels...


812
01:10:39.279 --> 01:10:42.574
that wanted these pesky lawmen
off their backs.


813
01:10:42.908 --> 01:10:46.244
You think killing all these politicians
is gonna make it easier for them?


814
01:10:46.495 --> 01:10:51.124
That's not my problem.
I was hired to do a job. I did the job.


815
01:10:51.249 --> 01:10:54.336
Like you. Just... my pay is better.

816
01:10:55.837 --> 01:10:57.422
My hair and my suit, too!

817
01:11:00.258 --> 01:11:01.468
Oh, Lola.

818
01:11:02.886 --> 01:11:05.472
Now, if you'll excuse me...
I have a plane to catch.


819
01:11:07.432 --> 01:11:08.100
Kill him.

820
01:11:09.851 --> 01:11:10.560
Ciao ciao!

821
01:11:15.649 --> 01:11:16.566
Don't even blink.

822
01:11:16.858 --> 01:11:17.901
What's in this for you?

823
01:11:18.068 --> 01:11:18.735
Pleasure.

824
01:11:22.572 --> 01:11:23.532
In killing you.

825
01:13:01.463 --> 01:13:03.882
And we're coming to you live
from the Key Biscane Casway...


826
01:13:04.007 --> 01:13:08.178
where at least 10 Police cars are in
hot pursuit of a stolen red pickup truck.


827
01:13:12.808 --> 01:13:15.977
Oh my! This is just nuts!
Jim, are you getting that?


828
01:13:16.144 --> 01:13:17.145
There is another car that is...

829
01:13:17.312 --> 01:13:19.022
swing past the police...

830
01:13:19.147 --> 01:13:20.440
as if they were standing still!

831
01:13:21.316 --> 01:13:22.567
That son of a bitch can drive.

832
01:13:23.735 --> 01:13:24.528
Yes, he can.

833
01:14:11.366 --> 01:14:12.993
We're clearance to take off, Mr Chalinni.

834
01:14:13.535 --> 01:14:16.788
Sit back, enjoy your flight, and
you'll be in Colombia before you know it.


835
01:15:02.918 --> 01:15:05.962
We have a problem with the landing gear.
Won't come up. I'm turning back to land.


836
01:15:06.087 --> 01:15:07.339
Can we fly with the problem?

837
01:15:07.672 --> 01:15:08.590
Yeah. Theoretically.

838
01:15:08.757 --> 01:15:10.217
Then you'll land when we get to Colombia.

839
01:15:12.677 --> 01:15:13.762
Go see if you can lift it manually.

840
01:15:15.430 --> 01:15:17.265
Sorry for the inconvenience,
Mr Challini.


841
01:15:17.349 --> 01:15:18.475
Nothing to worry about.

842
01:15:23.605 --> 01:15:25.482
Sorry. This flight's been canceled.

843
01:15:25.857 --> 01:15:29.527
Ah. I'm sorry to inform you
that you have been canceled.


844
01:15:30.487 --> 01:15:31.196
Have a seat!

845
01:15:34.115 --> 01:15:34.991
Relax!

846
01:15:36.910 --> 01:15:39.788
Drink something.
And let's get to know each other.


847
01:15:40.163 --> 01:15:41.957
I think I know
everything I need to know.

848
01:17:31.858 --> 01:17:32.650
Shit.

849
01:19:13.168 --> 01:19:17.297
For five points. What has eyes
but no ears. Skin, but no hair.


850
01:19:17.839 --> 01:19:20.633
It's white inside and brown outside. Mom?

851
01:19:21.342 --> 01:19:21.968
A worm?

852
01:19:22.093 --> 01:19:23.470
Wrong. Dad?

853
01:19:24.804 --> 01:19:25.638
A caterpillar?

854
01:19:25.763 --> 01:19:26.514
Wrong.

855
01:19:27.432 --> 01:19:28.516
A potato.

856
01:19:32.854 --> 01:19:33.646
May I help you?

857
01:19:34.606 --> 01:19:35.690
I was just leaving.

858
01:19:39.527 --> 01:19:40.111
A coconut?

859
01:19:40.236 --> 01:19:40.904
Wrong.

860
01:19:42.280 --> 01:19:43.156
A snake?

861
01:19:43.573 --> 01:19:44.240
Wrong.

862
01:19:45.408 --> 01:19:46.326
A peanut?

863
01:19:47.035 --> 01:19:47.785
Yuk!

864
01:19:48.870 --> 01:19:49.704
A hot dog?

865
01:19:49.954 --> 01:19:50.622
Wrong.

866
01:20:04.010 --> 01:20:04.969
That was fast.

867
01:20:05.220 --> 01:20:05.887
Yep.

868
01:20:07.472 --> 01:20:08.890
Didn't want you to miss your plane.

869
01:20:09.140 --> 01:20:10.642
That's very thoughtful of you.

870
01:20:25.615 --> 01:20:27.784
You won't believe
what happened to me last night...


871
01:20:28.243 --> 01:20:29.118
Crazy!

872
01:20:35.124 --> 01:20:36.668
I have something for you.

873
01:20:36.751 --> 01:20:38.628
I figure since you never
got to the beach.


874
01:20:38.753 --> 01:20:41.256
I know. Water is water. Sand is sand.

875
01:20:41.464 --> 01:20:43.383
Here, there. It's all the same.

876
01:20:43.508 --> 01:20:45.802
Air France flight 0069 for Paris
now in final boarding...


877
01:20:46.511 --> 01:20:49.597
Thank you, Frank.
It was an interesting vacation.


878
01:20:49.931 --> 01:20:51.432
What more could one ask for.

879
01:20:54.018 --> 01:20:54.769
Au revoir, Frank

880
01:20:54.936 --> 01:20:57.772
Au revoir, my friend. 
Have a good flight.

881
01:20:57.939 --> 01:21:00.233
I doubt it. They
said it is all headwinds.

882
01:21:00.567 --> 01:21:03.611
I guess we can't have everything
we wish for, can we?


883
01:21:05.154 --> 01:21:06.030
No, we can't.

884
01:21:22.255 --> 01:21:22.922
Yeah?

885
01:21:23.631 --> 01:21:25.258
I'm looking for a transporter.

886
01:21:29.971 --> 01:21:30.847
I'm listening.
