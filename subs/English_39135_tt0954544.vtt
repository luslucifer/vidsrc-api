A COUPLE OF HERETICS
LIKE YOURSELVES


476
00:42:46.768 --> 00:42:47.734
SHOULD HAVE MUCH TO DISCUSS

- YOU DON'T BELIEVE IN GOD?

493
00:43:51.207 --> 00:43:53.638
- THE VENGEFUL GOD
WITH A WHITE BEARD


494
00:43:53.671 --> 00:43:55.636
AND THE PUNISHMENT
LOOMING OVER OUR HEADS


495
00:43:55.669 --> 00:43:58.566
AND THEN THE JOY
THAT WILL SOLVE EVERYTHING,


496
00:43:58.599 --> 00:44:00.132
INCLUDING DEATH?

497
00:44:00.164 --> 00:44:02.030
NO, I DON'T BELIEVE IN THAT.

498
00:44:04.526 --> 00:44:05.724
I CHOOSE TO PUT MY FAITH
IN THE FACTS,


499
00:44:05.759 --> 00:44:10.056
ALTHOUGH IT WOULD HAVE ME TRIED
AS A HERETIC IN THESE PARTS.


500
00:44:15.050 --> 00:44:16.749
- MUCH AS IT ENTERTAINS YOU,
BARONESS,


501
00:44:16.782 --> 00:44:21.577
YOU WILL FIND THAT PEOPLE HERE
BELIEVE BECAUSE THEY NEED TO.
