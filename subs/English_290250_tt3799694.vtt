00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:06.358
How do you like my car, Big boy?

2
00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:45.158
<i>Bart, Sarah and Jonathan</i>

3
00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:47.590
<i>are spending their leisure day
at the city pool.</i>


4
00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:49.432
<i>Aren't they lucky?</i>

5
00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:00.755
<i>Let's see what they have
brought with them to the pool today.</i>


6
00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:03.512
<i>Bart has a plain towel.</i>

7
00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:06.956
<i>Sarah has a bright towel.</i>

8
00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:10.515
<i>Jonathan has a gay towel.</i>

9
00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:18.079
<i>There's something wrong
with kids today.</i>


10
00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:20.037
<i>They know too much.</i>

11
00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:23.197
<i>Take this little gem.</i>

12
00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:25.437
<i>She's 13.</i>

13
00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:27.079
<i>Already she's got herself a winner.</i>

14
00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:31.236
<i>Sure, he's three times her age,</i>

15
00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:35.109
<i>but he's got money for pot
and he drives a nice car.</i>


16
00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:38.158
Who's the man, baby?

17
00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:39.799
Who's the man?

18
00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.639
- You are. You're the man.
- Yeah. That's right.


19
00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:45.478
That's right. I'm the man.

20
00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:47.631
Oh, yes. You're my foxy-fox.

21
00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:49.800
<i>I'm not saying
I wasn't a little bastard.</i>


22
00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:52.269
<i>I mean, I grew up Irish.</i>

23
00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:55.079
<i>The Bronx. Riverdale.</i>

24
00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:00.034
<i>I don't have a job title,
I'm not in the Yellow Pages,</i>


25
00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:01.918
<i>but if you got trouble with someone,</i>

26
00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:04.719
<i>someone's messing around
with your underage daughter,</i>


27
00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:07.997
<i>you might ask around for me,
Jackson Healy.</i>


28
00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:12.634
Are you the man?

29
00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:13.915
What?

30
00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:18.110
Stay away from little girls.

31
00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:21.515
<i>Love. Grand, isn't it?</i>

32
00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:23.159
<i>I was in love once.</i>

33
00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:25.914
<i>Marriage is buying a house
for someone you hate.</i>


34
00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:27.149
<i>Remember that.</i>

35
00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:28.496
<i>I'm here with a representative</i>

36
00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:31.398
<i>of the Detroit Auto Manufacturers,
Mr. Bergen Paulsen.</i>


37
00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:32.856
<i>And, Mr. Paulsen, glad to have you here.</i>

38
00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:34.996
<i>I understand that you're in town
for the big show.</i>


39
00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:36.559
<i>Tell us a little bit about it.</i>

40
00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:39.120
<i>Take a look at this outstanding line-up
we have here for you.</i>


41
00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:42.192
<i>These cars are so incredible,
they practically drive themselves.</i>


42
00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:43.634
<i>I do have to ask you</i>

43
00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:46.189
<i>about the allegations about collusion</i>

44
00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:48.296
<i>in regards to a smog control device...</i>

45
00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:50.311
<i>the recent lawsuit against the Big Three.</i>

46
00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:51.776
<i>I'm not gonna dignify that...</i>

47
00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:53.711
<i>You have reached
March Investigations.</i>


48
00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:55.791
<i>This machine records messages.</i>

49
00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:58.679
<i>Wait for the tone and speak clearly.</i>

50
00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:00.256
<i>This is your daughter speaking.</i>

51
00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:03.636
<i>Thursday, as you may remember,
is my birthday.</i>


52
00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:05.756
<i>Please give accordingly.</i>

53
00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:10.439
<i>Also, I hope you didn't forget that
you're supposed to be working today.</i>


54
00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:26.515
<i>I wish I wished for things, man.</i>

55
00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:31.040
<i>My folks, they told me
to reach for the stars,</i>


56
00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:34.397
<i>and then my pals in the force
said reach for the brass ring,</i>


57
00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:35.834
<i>and then my wife died,</i>

58
00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.959
<i>and I reached for whatever came
in a gallon and cost a buck fifty.</i>


59
00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:42.037
<i>She used to say I got no follow-through.</i>

60
00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:44.111
<i>I hit nails in halfway and stop.</i>

61
00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:47.959
<i>She's not wrong.</i>

62
00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:50.696
<i>Hey, there's a line, asshole!</i>

63
00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:51.936
<i>Hey, what are you doing?</i>

64
00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:57.273
<i>They implemented a no-fault divorce here
a couple of years back</i>


65
00:06:57.440 --> 00:06:59.271
<i>that really screwed things up.</i>

66
00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:01.874
<i>A lot of private cops folded.</i>

67
00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:05.718
<i>Not me. I got this guy
in a local retirement park.</i>


68
00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:07.074
<i>He kicks a few cases my way.</i>

69
00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:09.869
<i>It's my husband.</i>

70
00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:11.473
Fred's his name.

71
00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:12.789
Fred.

72
00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:13.995
He's gone missing.

73
00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:15.229
Missing?

74
00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:17.038
<i>I'm terribly worried.</i>

75
00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:19.390
<i>It's just Fred's never been
gone this long before.</i>


76
00:07:28.120 --> 00:07:29.599
How long has he been missing?

77
00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:31.557
Since the funeral.

78
00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:36.790
Well, I can start right away.

79
00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:43.269
Amelia?

80
00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:44.839
Mr. Healy.

81
00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:48.592
Um, I think there's two of them,

82
00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:51.274
but I only have the name
and description for the one.


83
00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:54.718
<i>You can take care of them?</i>

84
00:07:54.880 --> 00:07:56.472
Consider it done.

85
00:07:57.320 --> 00:07:58.833
Thank you.

86
00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:00.991
- I feel better already.
- It's my job.


87
00:08:02.520 --> 00:08:05.353
They've been following me around
and asking my friends where I live.


88
00:08:05.520 --> 00:08:09.035
I've just been really scared,
but, um, you make me feel safe.


89
00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:10.679
You're short.

90
00:08:10.880 --> 00:08:12.199
I'm what?

91
00:08:12.360 --> 00:08:14.191
You're seven dollars short.

92
00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:16.272
Right, um...

93
00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:18.308
Sorry. Um...

94
00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:23.473
<i>Sometimes
I feel okay about things.</i>


95
00:08:23.680 --> 00:08:25.033
<i>Not often.</i>

96
00:08:25.640 --> 00:08:28.029
<i>Could try for an investigator's license.</i>

97
00:08:28.200 --> 00:08:29.315
<i>Become a P.I.</i>

98
00:08:29.520 --> 00:08:30.999
<i>Those guys help people.</i>

99
00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:32.760
<i>Maybe then I'd feel good in the morning.</i>

100
00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:34.632
She's got dark hair,

101
00:08:34.800 --> 00:08:37.837
about yea high.

102
00:08:38.400 --> 00:08:39.833
Name's Amelia.

103
00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:41.513
She might be from the neighborhood.

104
00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:45.235
- No, can't help you, buddy.
- No?


105
00:08:45.400 --> 00:08:46.594
Sorry.

106
00:08:46.760 --> 00:08:49.832
<i>I work in a cesspool.
Sex. More sex.</i>


107
00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:53.710
<i>My wife, she used to say
I make a living off rumpy-pumpy.</i>


108
00:08:53.920 --> 00:08:55.069
<i>Whatever. She was English.</i>

109
00:08:55.240 --> 00:08:56.536
<i>I don't know
what the fuck it means either.</i>


110
00:08:56.560 --> 00:08:58.216
<i>The point is I don't care
if Colonel Mustard</i>


111
00:08:58.240 --> 00:08:59.800
<i>did it in the study with a candlestick,</i>

112
00:08:59.840 --> 00:09:02.832
<i>I just wanna know who he did it with
and get the pictures.</i>


113
00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:04.296
<i>Yeah, I think I remember her.</i>

114
00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:05.799
Amelia, right?

115
00:09:06.920 --> 00:09:08.400
Was in here three or four nights ago.

116
00:09:08.520 --> 00:09:10.351
Drank bourbon martinis.

117
00:09:10.920 --> 00:09:12.911
Well, that's disgusting.

118
00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:17.470
Any chance she, uh,
paid with a credit card?


119
00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:20.991
As in, am I gonna pull
the receipts for you?


120
00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:22.918
Fat fucking chance.

121
00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:35.548
Is that a shirt?

122
00:09:35.720 --> 00:09:37.039
Yeah.

123
00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:38.394
It's very pretty.

124
00:09:38.560 --> 00:09:40.232
I made it myself.

125
00:09:40.720 --> 00:09:41.835
Yeah?

126
00:09:43.280 --> 00:09:45.077
I made this.

127
00:09:46.240 --> 00:09:48.435
<i>Look, I'm not saying it's easy.</i>

128
00:09:48.640 --> 00:09:51.234
<i>I'm not saying you don't
gotta think on your feet,</i>


129
00:09:51.400 --> 00:09:53.550
<i>bend a few rules maybe,</i>

130
00:09:53.720 --> 00:09:56.792
<i>but it's worth it,</i>

131
00:09:56.960 --> 00:09:58.951
<i>as long as you get the results.</i>

132
00:10:07.160 --> 00:10:08.593
Okay, that's it.

133
00:10:09.040 --> 00:10:10.109
That's a lot of blood.

134
00:10:10.280 --> 00:10:12.635
That is a lot... 
That's a lot of blood.

135
00:10:16.280 --> 00:10:18.111
We're losing him. Go! Hurry up!

136
00:10:18.280 --> 00:10:19.998
Now, don't go anywhere. Don't...

137
00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:22.310
Stay with me. Stay with me! Sir.

138
00:10:28.400 --> 00:10:33.428
Now, tell me, are
you willing to find God?

139
00:10:38.440 --> 00:10:40.829
Look, I'm trying to find Amelia.

00:12:51.680 --> 00:12:53.636
Mr. March, we're gonna play a game.

161
00:12:53.800 --> 00:12:55.120
I think you have the wrong house.

162
00:12:57.600 --> 00:12:59.272
It's called, "Shut up unless you're me."

163
00:13:02.800 --> 00:13:04.392
I love that game.

164
00:13:05.280 --> 00:13:06.793
You're a private investigator?

165
00:13:06.960 --> 00:13:08.936
Look, there's 20 bucks in there,
all right? Just take it.


166
00:13:08.960 --> 00:13:12.077
No, I'm not here for that.
I told you, I'm a messenger.


167
00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:17.070
You can afford
to live like this as a P.I.?


168
00:13:17.240 --> 00:13:18.673
What's the message?

169
00:13:18.840 --> 00:13:19.840
Oh, right, right.

170
00:13:22.520 --> 00:13:25.671
Stop looking for Amelia, all right?

171
00:13:25.840 --> 00:13:27.831
I'm not even looking for Amelia.

172
00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.389
She's a person of interest, man.

173
00:13:30.560 --> 00:13:31.675
Fine.

174
00:13:31.840 --> 00:13:33.831
I'm done. Put a fork in me.

175
00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:35.558
Don't really put a fork in me.

176
00:13:35.720 --> 00:13:38.256
Amelia's gonna be very happy
that you got the message so quickly.


177
00:13:38.280 --> 00:13:40.350
It's gonna make her smile. That's good.

178
00:13:40.520 --> 00:13:43.557
Now, ahem, I got one more thing I need
to ask you before we're done here.


179
00:13:43.720 --> 00:13:45.153
You wanna know who hired me.

180
00:13:45.320 --> 00:13:46.320
Bingo. Yeah.

181
00:13:46.480 --> 00:13:48.576
Now, we can do this the easy way
or we can do it the hard way.


182
00:13:48.600 --> 00:13:50.033
- Glenn.
- What?


183
00:13:50.200 --> 00:13:51.200
Lily Glenn. Two N's.

184
00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:53.794
Old lady hired me
to find her niece on Tuesday.


185
00:13:53.960 --> 00:13:55.313
You just gave up your client.

186
00:13:55.480 --> 00:13:57.630
I made a discretionary revelation.

187
00:13:57.800 --> 00:13:59.279
No. No, you just gave her up.

188
00:13:59.440 --> 00:14:00.919
I asked you one simple question.

189
00:14:01.080 --> 00:14:02.216
You gave me all the information.

190
00:14:02.240 --> 00:14:03.496
I thought that's what you wanted.

191
00:14:03.520 --> 00:14:04.794
What?

192
00:14:11.520 --> 00:14:14.273
Now, I'm very sorry that
you didn't get the message.


193
00:14:14.440 --> 00:14:17.193
Me, too. But I get it now.

194
00:14:17.360 --> 00:14:18.760
I get it. I dig it.

195
00:14:20.760 --> 00:14:23.069
Shit!

196
00:14:23.320 --> 00:14:26.073
What about now? 
You get the message now?

197
00:14:27.120 --> 00:14:28.917
- Yep.
- Are you sure?


198
00:14:29.560 --> 00:14:30.560
Yeah, I'm cool.

199
00:14:30.760 --> 00:14:32.716
- All right. Give me your left arm.
- Huh?


200
00:14:32.920 --> 00:14:34.656
<i>Your left arm.
Give me your left arm. This one.</i>


201
00:14:34.680 --> 00:14:35.999
- No!
- Yeah, come on.


202
00:14:36.160 --> 00:14:37.160
No!

203
00:14:37.720 --> 00:14:38.789
Get... No!

204
00:14:38.960 --> 00:14:40.029
Did you cut yourself?

205
00:14:40.200 --> 00:14:41.394
I'm dealing with an injury.

206
00:14:41.600 --> 00:14:43.376
Right, look, when you're
talking to your doctor,


207
00:14:43.400 --> 00:14:47.439
just tell him you have
a spiral fracture of the left radius.


208
00:14:47.600 --> 00:14:48.600
No! No!

209
00:14:48.760 --> 00:14:49.760
- Deep breath.
<i>- No!</i>


210
00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:56.479
Do you mind if I have an apple?

211
00:14:58.320 --> 00:15:00.595
All right, Mr. March.
You have a good day, okay?


212
00:15:06.400 --> 00:15:08.118
- Hi.
- Hey.


213
00:15:09.120 --> 00:15:10.120
Want a Yoo-hoo?

214
00:15:10.280 --> 00:15:11.554
A Yoo-hoo?

215
00:15:12.280 --> 00:15:13.633
Are you kidding?

216
00:15:15.160 --> 00:15:16.434
Oh, yeah.

217
00:15:17.520 --> 00:15:20.432
You know, I haven't had one
of these in about 30 years.


218
00:15:20.640 --> 00:15:22.039
Are you a friend of my dad's?

219
00:15:22.200 --> 00:15:24.589
Yeah, yeah. We're business associates.

220
00:15:24.760 --> 00:15:26.079
He's inside resting.

221
00:15:27.240 --> 00:15:31.199
Didn't I see you crawling round
a vacant lot a couple of blocks over?


222
00:15:31.640 --> 00:15:35.155
Um, maybe. I read there sometimes.

223
00:15:35.360 --> 00:15:36.679
Right.

224
00:15:37.800 --> 00:15:40.109
"It's me-he for Yoo-hoo!" Thanks again.

225
00:15:40.280 --> 00:15:41.395
Bye.

226
00:15:49.160 --> 00:15:52.391
<i>Because the gas prices
are up 16 cents a gallon,</i>


227
00:15:52.560 --> 00:15:56.075
<i>uh, the US now
is looking into alternative fuels.</i>


228
00:15:56.240 --> 00:16:00.836
There's a process where you can
put corn in and gas comes out.


229
00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:02.274
<i>I'm no scientist,</i>

230
00:16:02.440 --> 00:16:05.318
<i>but that's been my process
with corn for years.</i>


231
00:16:08.280 --> 00:16:09.474
Hey.

232
00:16:09.640 --> 00:16:11.870
It's not a public area up here.

233
00:16:14.880 --> 00:16:15.880
Wow.

234
00:16:17.120 --> 00:16:19.509
You got like an apartment up here?

235
00:16:19.680 --> 00:16:22.592
If you're looking for the restroom,
back down the stairs.


236
00:16:24.560 --> 00:16:25.879
We're looking for Amelia.

237
00:16:31.960 --> 00:16:35.509
<i>I'm telling you,
I saw her, Mr. March.</i>


238
00:16:35.680 --> 00:16:38.797
I didn't imagine it. 
I saw my Misty alive.

239
00:16:38.960 --> 00:16:41.110
Mrs. Glenn, be reasonable.

240
00:16:41.280 --> 00:16:43.316
This is a high-profile case.

241
00:16:43.480 --> 00:16:48.031
Your niece is a very famous actress,

242
00:16:48.200 --> 00:16:51.636
and the head medical examiner
ID'd her himself.


243
00:16:51.800 --> 00:16:54.712
I saw her through the front window.

244
00:16:54.880 --> 00:16:56.000
- You didn't.
<i>- Clear as day.</i>


245
00:16:56.040 --> 00:16:57.040
<i>She was wearing...</i>

246
00:16:57.240 --> 00:16:58.920
The pinstriped suit. I know.
Very specific.


247
00:16:59.040 --> 00:17:00.376
<i>She was writing something and then</i>

248
00:17:00.400 --> 00:17:05.235
she came out and she drove away,
and this was two days after the accident.


249
00:17:05.400 --> 00:17:08.073
And I thought that
you said you found her.

250
00:17:08.240 --> 00:17:10.117
Now, what was that bonus payment?

251
00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:12.115
I never said I found her.

252
00:17:12.280 --> 00:17:15.033
I said I was tracking
the girl that you saw


253
00:17:15.200 --> 00:17:18.112
and that was probably
this young lady, Amelia.


254
00:17:18.280 --> 00:17:20.714
Why don't you believe me?

255
00:17:20.880 --> 00:17:22.836
Mrs. Glenn, Misty's dead.

256
00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:24.592
She died in that accident.

257
00:17:24.760 --> 00:17:27.877
<i>I never should have taken
your money in the first place.</i>


258
00:17:28.040 --> 00:17:30.031
I'm very sorry about that.

259
00:17:32.600 --> 00:17:36.229
Even... No, even if this
Amelia girl isn't my niece,


260
00:17:36.440 --> 00:17:37.509
<i>she might know something.</i>

261
00:17:37.680 --> 00:17:41.195
Please, please, will you keep looking?

262
00:17:41.360 --> 00:17:42.588
No.

263
00:17:45.040 --> 00:17:46.519
Mr. March...

264
00:18:07.560 --> 00:18:09.152
Can I ask you a question?

265
00:18:09.320 --> 00:18:10.639
Tell me the truth.

266
00:18:10.800 --> 00:18:14.076
And don't take it easy on me
just 'cause I'm your father.


267
00:18:14.240 --> 00:18:16.754
You just tell it to me straight.

268
00:18:16.920 --> 00:18:18.114
Am I a bad person?

269
00:18:18.320 --> 00:18:19.469
Yes.

270
00:18:24.320 --> 00:18:25.673
Just drive.

271
00:18:30.240 --> 00:18:32.470
I'm gonna ask you again.

272
00:18:32.640 --> 00:18:34.790
Where is Amelia?

273
00:18:36.120 --> 00:18:38.236
I would like to help you,

274
00:18:38.400 --> 00:18:40.630
but I just don't know
anybody called Amelia.


275
00:18:40.840 --> 00:18:42.159
Oh, okay.

276
00:18:43.560 --> 00:18:47.838
You don't talk, I'm gonna have to start
breaking your fingers.


277
00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:49.638
<i>You understand?</i>

278
00:18:49.800 --> 00:18:51.028
Yes, I understand.

279
00:18:51.200 --> 00:18:52.553
Hey, hotshot, come on in here.

280
00:18:52.720 --> 00:18:54.631
I found something hidden in the cabinet.

281
00:18:54.800 --> 00:18:55.949
Really?

282
00:18:57.760 --> 00:18:59.318
Watch him.

283
00:18:59.480 --> 00:19:00.708
No, hey, don't.

284
00:19:00.880 --> 00:19:04.031
Hey, don't open that
because that's not mine.


285
00:19:04.240 --> 00:19:05.496
It belongs to a friend. I just, uh...

286
00:19:05.520 --> 00:19:06.520
I look after it for him.

287
00:19:06.680 --> 00:19:08.511
But it's one of those bags.

288
00:19:08.680 --> 00:19:09.896
<i>If you try to open it...</i>

289
00:19:09.920 --> 00:19:10.920
<i>Oh, fuck! Fuck!</i>

290
00:19:11.120 --> 00:19:12.189
Shit!

291
00:19:12.680 --> 00:19:14.511
<i>Motherfucker!</i>

292
00:19:15.040 --> 00:19:16.040
Motherfucker!

293
00:19:16.200 --> 00:19:17.474
- I can't see nothing.
- Yeah.


294
00:19:17.640 --> 00:19:19.995
Oh, God. What the fuck?

295
00:19:20.160 --> 00:19:21.912
Okay. Yeah.

296
00:19:22.480 --> 00:19:24.840
You know that color
doesn't come off, right?


297
00:19:27.400 --> 00:19:28.628
I tried to tell you.

298
00:19:32.040 --> 00:19:33.996
You tried to tell me?

299
00:19:39.680 --> 00:19:40.795
<i>Fuck you!</i>

300
00:19:40.960 --> 00:19:42.109
Hey, hey. Oh, no! Hey!

301
00:19:42.320 --> 00:19:43.878
<i>Not the fish. Come on.</i>

302
00:19:44.040 --> 00:19:46.600
Hey, can you ask this guy
to behave like a professional?


303
00:19:46.760 --> 00:19:48.557
You know, kid,
when I get that gun off you,


304
00:19:48.720 --> 00:19:49.994
it's gonna be your dinner.

305
00:19:50.200 --> 00:19:52.077
Dinner?

306
00:19:52.520 --> 00:19:56.035
It's fucking...
You're funny. You're funny.


307
00:19:56.200 --> 00:19:57.200
Don't... Don't...

308
00:19:57.360 --> 00:19:58.952
Come on, fish.

309
00:20:00.040 --> 00:20:01.736
You want some fucking dinner?
Do you want some dinner?


310
00:20:01.760 --> 00:20:03.216
Why are you doing this?
This is not gonna help you.


311
00:20:03.240 --> 00:20:04.376
- There you go.
- Now, come on.


312
00:20:04.400 --> 00:20:06.200
You're gonna eat that thing,
you fucking fuck!


313
00:20:06.280 --> 00:20:11.832
Look, you gotta stop and
think about this, all right?


314
00:20:14.240 --> 00:20:17.471
When you came here tonight,
was this what you wanted to happen?


315
00:20:17.640 --> 00:20:20.916
What, you came here
to make me eat fish?

316
00:20:21.080 --> 00:20:22.479
To shoot me?

317
00:20:23.560 --> 00:20:26.160
<i>Look, if you come in here,
you beat up on me, you trash the place,</i>


318
00:20:26.280 --> 00:20:28.040
I understand, I get it,
it's part of the job.


319
00:20:28.080 --> 00:20:29.638
I accept it, all right?

320
00:20:29.800 --> 00:20:30.869
But what did you do?

321
00:20:31.040 --> 00:20:34.157
You did something different
from that, didn't you? Right?


322
00:20:34.320 --> 00:20:36.038
You pissed me off.

323
00:20:36.480 --> 00:20:37.993
You made an enemy.

324
00:20:38.880 --> 00:20:41.758
Now, even if I knew something,
I wouldn't tell you, kid.


325
00:20:41.960 --> 00:20:43.440
And you know why I wouldn't tell you?

326
00:20:43.480 --> 00:20:47.075
And this is... It's not my only reason,
but it is a principle reason.


327
00:20:47.240 --> 00:20:49.993
You know, I wouldn't tell you
'cause you're a fucking moron.


328
00:20:50.440 --> 00:20:52.271
What the...

329
00:20:56.560 --> 00:20:58.357
You stupid son of a bitch!

330
00:21:12.600 --> 00:21:14.256
- Six. I'm a six.
- I'm a seven!


331
00:21:14.280 --> 00:21:15.280
Six!

332
00:21:15.440 --> 00:21:17.112
- Seven!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.


333
00:21:17.280 --> 00:21:19.555
Jesus Christ! One at a time!

334
00:21:21.320 --> 00:21:23.629
You took the Lord's name in vain.

335
00:21:23.800 --> 00:21:25.392
No, I didn't, Janet.

336
00:21:25.560 --> 00:21:28.233
I found it very useful, actually.
Okay, Janet?


337
00:21:30.720 --> 00:21:32.676
<i>Birthday girl!</i>

338
00:21:54.040 --> 00:21:55.871
March. Jack Healy.

339
00:21:56.080 --> 00:21:58.514
Don't get upset. 
I'm not here to hurt you.

340
00:21:58.680 --> 00:21:59.960
<i>I just wanna ask you a question.</i>

341
00:22:01.200 --> 00:22:02.200
Hey, no.

342
00:22:02.360 --> 00:22:04.510
How stupid do you think I am?

343
00:22:04.680 --> 00:22:06.955
I got a license to carry, motherfucker.

344
00:22:07.120 --> 00:22:08.951
Ever since your little visit
the other day,


345
00:22:09.120 --> 00:22:11.315
this little baby's gonna stay right here.

346
00:22:12.240 --> 00:22:13.673
Fuck, fuck.

347
00:22:25.640 --> 00:22:26.675
Look away.

348
00:22:28.560 --> 00:22:29.675
Look...

349
00:22:30.880 --> 00:22:33.792
- You know there's a mirror here, right?
- Close your eyes.


350
00:22:35.640 --> 00:22:39.599
Fucking damn it. Forget it.
You know what? Turn around.


351
00:22:39.760 --> 00:22:41.876
- Can I open my eyes?
- Yeah, open your eyes.


352
00:22:46.560 --> 00:22:48.232
What do you want?

353
00:22:48.400 --> 00:22:50.550
I want you to find Amelia.

354
00:22:53.120 --> 00:22:56.430
So you think these guys
are gonna hurt Amelia?


355
00:22:56.640 --> 00:22:59.632
Sure, after they're done killing her.

356
00:23:01.160 --> 00:23:02.718
You know, I asked around about you.

357
00:23:02.880 --> 00:23:05.456
There's a couple of people I trust
say you're pretty good at this.


358
00:23:05.480 --> 00:23:07.240
Well, that's surprising.
I would have thought


359
00:23:07.280 --> 00:23:09.999
your job ended with
breaking my fucking arm.


360
00:23:10.160 --> 00:23:11.936
Well, you know,
technically it did.


361
00:23:11.960 --> 00:23:12.960
I'm off the clock.

362
00:23:13.120 --> 00:23:14.439
This is a separate situation.

363
00:23:16.160 --> 00:23:18.594
I'm not buying this nice guy act, pal.

364
00:23:18.760 --> 00:23:20.398
She owes you money, doesn't she?

365
00:23:20.560 --> 00:23:21.896
You're coming to collect?

366
00:23:21.920 --> 00:23:22.920
You want me to finger her

367
00:23:23.120 --> 00:23:25.076
so you can throw acid in her face?
Well, no.


368
00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:28.434
No, she paid me up front,
actually, you know.


369
00:23:28.600 --> 00:23:32.832
What it is, for me, is I like where I live
and I don't wanna move.


370
00:23:34.440 --> 00:23:37.113
So, two days in advance.

371
00:23:37.280 --> 00:23:38.872
$400.

372
00:23:42.160 --> 00:23:43.798
Plus whatever the old lady's giving you.

373
00:23:43.960 --> 00:23:46.758
Old lady? Fuck you, old lady.

374
00:23:46.920 --> 00:23:49.514
You broke my arm. 
I quit, remember?

375
00:23:49.680 --> 00:23:51.750
So call her up,
get back on the case.

376
00:23:51.920 --> 00:23:53.319
Get paid twice.

377
00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:56.958
Wow, that is very telling.

378
00:23:57.680 --> 00:23:59.238
I'm a detective and we have a code.

379
00:23:59.400 --> 00:24:00.469
We don't do that.

380
00:24:00.640 --> 00:24:02.710
But interesting. Good to know.

381
00:24:02.880 --> 00:24:04.313
- Okay.
- Good to know.


382
00:24:04.480 --> 00:24:05.880
You were looking for Amelia, right?

383
00:24:05.960 --> 00:24:07.552
Yes and no.

384
00:24:07.720 --> 00:24:08.948
Excuse me?

385
00:24:09.120 --> 00:24:11.918
My profession is very complicated, okay?

386
00:24:12.080 --> 00:24:13.149
It's nuanced.

387
00:24:14.360 --> 00:24:16.191
What does that mean?

388
00:24:16.360 --> 00:24:17.839
Fuck it.

389
00:24:19.160 --> 00:24:20.718
Last week this old broad comes to me

390
00:24:20.880 --> 00:24:23.235
and she asks me to find her niece,
Misty Mountains.


391
00:24:23.400 --> 00:24:24.674
Misty Mountains?

392
00:24:25.320 --> 00:24:27.515
The porno actress? 
The one that died?

393
00:24:27.680 --> 00:24:29.398
The young lady.

394
00:24:29.560 --> 00:24:31.516
The porno young lady.

395
00:24:31.680 --> 00:24:35.719
But, yeah, she died in a crash
and then two days later,


396
00:24:35.880 --> 00:24:37.656
her aunt goes to her house
to clean out the place,


397
00:24:37.680 --> 00:24:38.680
and lo and behold,

398
00:24:38.840 --> 00:24:41.229
alive and well, 
Misty Mountains.

399
00:24:41.400 --> 00:24:42.616
She sees her through the window.

400
00:24:42.640 --> 00:24:43.868
She sees her get in her car.

401
00:24:44.080 --> 00:24:45.798
- She sees her drive away.
- Bullshit.


402
00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:48.036
Bullshit's right.
She's dead and then she's alive.


403
00:24:48.200 --> 00:24:49.400
That's what I'm talking about.

404
00:24:49.480 --> 00:24:51.038
It's very fucking complicated.

405
00:24:52.120 --> 00:24:53.519
But I persevere, you know.

406
00:24:53.680 --> 00:24:56.592
I run the tape through and I think,
"Okay, maybe there was a girl there."


407
00:24:56.800 --> 00:25:00.793
Amelia? The old lady saw Amelia?

408
00:25:00.960 --> 00:25:04.475
Well, look who decided
to show up for class.


409
00:25:04.680 --> 00:25:05.715
Yeah.

410
00:25:05.880 --> 00:25:07.279
There's a gate guard,

411
00:25:07.440 --> 00:25:09.400
he keeps track
of all the cars that go in and out.


412
00:25:09.440 --> 00:25:12.398
So I checked with him,
I ran the plate, I got the name.


413
00:25:12.560 --> 00:25:13.560
And?

414
00:25:15.200 --> 00:25:16.200
Three.

415
00:25:17.560 --> 00:25:18.788
Three what?

416
00:25:18.960 --> 00:25:21.235
Three days in advance
if you want the rest of the story.


417
00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:25.151
Fuck you. Come on, $600?
That's fucking robbery.


418
00:25:25.320 --> 00:25:26.469
I've only got $400.

419
00:25:26.640 --> 00:25:28.756
Well, it's early.

420
00:25:28.920 --> 00:25:31.388
You can go rob
a bank if you hurry.

421
00:25:31.640 --> 00:25:33.153
Jesus!

422
00:25:33.560 --> 00:25:34.913
What are you doing here?

423
00:25:35.080 --> 00:25:36.399
Giving you a rim job.

424
00:25:36.560 --> 00:25:38.915
What? Rim shot.

425
00:25:39.080 --> 00:25:40.752
- Rim shot.
- Whatever.


426
00:25:40.920 --> 00:25:43.036
Hey, can we go one more game before...

427
00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:46.638
You're the guy who beat up my dad.

428
00:25:46.800 --> 00:25:47.835
Hey.

429
00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:49.120
No. Sucker-punched your dad.

430
00:25:49.240 --> 00:25:51.515
<i>Big difference. 
But don't worry.</i>

431
00:25:51.680 --> 00:25:53.113
<i>He just did it for money.</i>

432
00:25:53.280 --> 00:25:56.192
You beat people up
and charge money?


433
00:25:56.400 --> 00:25:57.879
Yeah. Sad, isn't it?

434
00:25:58.040 --> 00:25:59.393
- That's really your job?
- Yeah.


435
00:25:59.560 --> 00:26:00.595
- No way.
- Yeah.


436
00:26:00.760 --> 00:26:03.433
So, um, how much would you charge
to beat up my friend Janet?


437
00:26:03.600 --> 00:26:04.999
- What?
- How much you got?


438
00:26:05.200 --> 00:26:07.111
- Thirty bucks.
- Look, apple pie.


439
00:26:07.280 --> 00:26:09.919
- Is she a big girl?
- She's tall. Super annoying.


440
00:26:10.120 --> 00:26:12.031
<i>- Apple pie.</i>
- She's always mean to me.


441
00:26:12.200 --> 00:26:13.952
This conversation is over.

442
00:26:14.120 --> 00:26:15.269
We're just talking.

443
00:26:15.440 --> 00:26:16.953
And it's over.

444
00:26:19.520 --> 00:26:21.431
$400, that's all.

445
00:26:22.480 --> 00:26:24.471
$400, two days.

446
00:26:24.680 --> 00:26:26.875
We find her earlier,
I still get to keep it.


447
00:26:27.040 --> 00:26:28.758
Done.

448
00:26:28.920 --> 00:26:30.592
<i>Deal. Great.</i>

449
00:26:30.760 --> 00:26:32.990
'Cause I already know where she is.

450
00:26:39.320 --> 00:26:40.856
<i>Adult film star Misty Mountains,</i>

451
00:26:40.880 --> 00:26:43.314
<i>shown here at last month's
Detroit auto show.</i>


452
00:26:43.480 --> 00:26:45.072
High-profile case for you, right?

453
00:26:45.280 --> 00:26:47.157
Made the newspapers.

454
00:26:48.240 --> 00:26:50.360
You know, the thing about
keeping your mouth closed is


455
00:26:50.480 --> 00:26:51.708
it prevents you from speaking.

456
00:26:51.880 --> 00:26:53.279
Sure.

457
00:26:53.440 --> 00:26:55.635
Unless, of course, you're a ventriloquist.

458
00:26:55.800 --> 00:26:57.028
Fuck those guys.

459
00:26:57.200 --> 00:26:58.616
You can always see their mouths moving.

460
00:26:58.640 --> 00:26:59.789
You can what?

461
00:26:59.960 --> 00:27:01.096
Ventriloquism, it doesn't work.

462
00:27:01.120 --> 00:27:02.155
Sometimes.

463
00:27:02.320 --> 00:27:03.469
Never.

464
00:27:05.120 --> 00:27:06.473
Look at these idiots.

465
00:27:06.680 --> 00:27:08.079
<i>Join us!</i>

466
00:27:10.760 --> 00:27:12.671
All right. Well...

467
00:27:14.280 --> 00:27:15.315
Goodbye.

468
00:27:15.520 --> 00:27:16.640
Hey, hey, hey, hey. Hold on.

469
00:27:16.760 --> 00:27:18.637
What do you mean, goodbye?

470
00:27:18.800 --> 00:27:20.791
This is Amelia's protest group.

471
00:27:21.880 --> 00:27:23.598
She's in there somewhere, so have at it.

472
00:27:23.760 --> 00:27:25.273
Wait. How do you know she's in there?

473
00:27:25.440 --> 00:27:27.635
'Cause it's her protest group.
She started it.


474
00:27:27.800 --> 00:27:30.155
That's the hot tip I got yesterday
before you broke my arm.


475
00:27:30.320 --> 00:27:32.038
Yeah, but she's holed up somewhere hiding.

476
00:27:32.200 --> 00:27:34.191
What makes you think she's gonna be here?

477
00:27:35.120 --> 00:27:36.936
- That's her protest group.
- Stop saying that.


478
00:27:36.960 --> 00:27:38.096
- I'd like to stop saying...
- You said that.


479
00:27:38.120 --> 00:27:40.336
- I hear it. It's her protest group.
- I don't hear you hearing it.


480
00:27:40.360 --> 00:27:41.793
Hey, Amelia?

481
00:27:44.040 --> 00:27:46.031
- Amelia?
- Amelia?


482
00:27:46.200 --> 00:27:48.668
- She's not here.
- She's here.


483
00:27:48.840 --> 00:27:50.319
Amelia.

484
00:27:50.480 --> 00:27:51.993
We can't talk to you.

485
00:27:52.160 --> 00:27:54.196
Who said that?

486
00:27:54.360 --> 00:27:56.999
We can't talk to you. We're dead.

487
00:27:57.160 --> 00:27:58.559
No, I...

488
00:28:00.280 --> 00:28:02.589
Yeah, I get it, you know.

489
00:28:02.760 --> 00:28:04.512
Like it's very clever. I'm hip.

490
00:28:04.680 --> 00:28:06.716
But this is actually
a really serious matter.


491
00:28:06.880 --> 00:28:08.677
So is this. We've all been killed.

492
00:28:08.840 --> 00:28:10.558
No, you haven't.

493
00:28:10.720 --> 00:28:12.472
Fuck you, man. We're dead!

494
00:28:12.640 --> 00:28:14.995
They can't talk to you, man. They're dead.

495
00:28:15.160 --> 00:28:17.276
What's the protest about? Do you know?

496
00:28:18.640 --> 00:28:20.915
Any of you know why you're protesting?

497
00:28:21.080 --> 00:28:22.399
The air.

498
00:28:22.560 --> 00:28:23.913
Air.

499
00:28:24.080 --> 00:28:25.195
You're protesting the air?

500
00:28:25.360 --> 00:28:26.509
The pollution.

501
00:28:26.720 --> 00:28:28.551
The birds can't breathe.

502
00:28:28.760 --> 00:28:30.910
So all of you died
because of the pollution?


503
00:28:31.080 --> 00:28:32.080
Right.

504
00:28:32.240 --> 00:28:35.232
What about the gas masks?
They didn't save you?


505
00:28:37.480 --> 00:28:39.471
This is fucking... All right.

506
00:28:41.120 --> 00:28:42.553
- Fucker.
- Sorry.


507
00:28:42.720 --> 00:28:44.711
I thought you were dead.

508
00:28:44.880 --> 00:28:49.351
Look, Amelia, we know you're here,
so this is very...


509
00:28:49.520 --> 00:28:51.829
Hey, dickhead. 
She's not here.

510
00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:53.911
She's not here
because of her boyfriend.


511
00:28:54.120 --> 00:28:57.749
Her boyfriend died,
like, really died, like, three days ago.


512
00:28:57.960 --> 00:28:59.712
<i>- Her boyfriend died?</i>
- Yeah.


513
00:28:59.920 --> 00:29:00.920
So where is she?

514
00:29:01.080 --> 00:29:02.513
Sorry, can't help you. We're dead.

515
00:29:02.680 --> 00:29:04.352
God damn it.

516
00:29:04.520 --> 00:29:07.557
All right, which one of you cock and balls
wants to make 20 bucks, huh?


517
00:29:20.160 --> 00:29:21.479
Up here, Chet?

518
00:29:21.640 --> 00:29:22.993
Yeah, make a left here.

519
00:29:25.080 --> 00:29:27.913
It's here. Just pull over.

520
00:29:28.080 --> 00:29:30.833
It's right here. On the left.

521
00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:32.991
Right... Look. Left.

522
00:29:33.200 --> 00:29:34.553
Right here.

523
00:29:36.200 --> 00:29:37.918
<i>This is Dean's house.</i>

524
00:29:38.120 --> 00:29:39.872
Amelia's boyfriend, Dean.

525
00:29:40.080 --> 00:29:42.150
You gotta be fucking kidding me.

526
00:29:42.320 --> 00:29:44.276
I know, it's crazy.

527
00:29:44.600 --> 00:29:46.477
What the fuck is this, Chet?

528
00:29:51.600 --> 00:29:53.636
This place looks so much bigger now.

529
00:29:53.800 --> 00:29:56.268
Do you even really know Amelia, Chet?

530
00:29:56.440 --> 00:29:59.159
Uh, yeah, well, like kind of like
mainly through Dean.


531
00:29:59.320 --> 00:30:01.231
Dean was a filmmaker. Um...

532
00:30:02.120 --> 00:30:04.998
Kind of like experimental kinds
of films. Um...


533
00:30:05.160 --> 00:30:09.711
That's actually like kind of how we met,
'cause I'm kind of in the business myself.


534
00:30:09.880 --> 00:30:11.074
Huh? What do you do?

535
00:30:11.280 --> 00:30:12.508
Projectionalist.

536
00:30:13.440 --> 00:30:14.998
<i>Yeah, anyway, um, Dean had</i>

537
00:30:15.200 --> 00:30:17.839
this whole room,
like, filled with film stock.


538
00:30:18.040 --> 00:30:20.508
One day it just went up,
you know...


539
00:30:20.680 --> 00:30:25.231
And, uh, yeah, it cost the guy
his life and his life's work.


540
00:30:25.400 --> 00:30:28.039
So, kind of, I don't know,
kind of makes you think, right?


541
00:30:28.200 --> 00:30:29.349
Not really, Chet.

542
00:30:31.440 --> 00:30:33.556
Hey, kid. Kid.

543
00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:35.069
What?

544
00:30:35.240 --> 00:30:37.196
You know the guy who lived here?

545
00:30:37.360 --> 00:30:39.396
Maybe. What's it to you?

546
00:30:39.600 --> 00:30:41.238
Hey, he'll give you $20 if you answer.

547
00:30:41.400 --> 00:30:42.799
I didn't say that.

548
00:30:42.960 --> 00:30:45.793
20 bucks, man, or you can blow.

549
00:30:45.960 --> 00:30:46.960
Wow.

550
00:30:48.160 --> 00:30:49.513
Thank you.

551
00:30:50.640 --> 00:30:52.710
Yeah, I knew the dude.

552
00:30:53.920 --> 00:30:55.592
Filmmaker dude.

553
00:30:55.760 --> 00:30:57.398
Saw him making a film last month.

554
00:30:57.560 --> 00:30:58.993
Experimental films, right?

555
00:30:59.200 --> 00:31:02.033
I guess. More like a nudie film.

556
00:31:02.200 --> 00:31:05.351
Did you see a girl
about 5'8", dark hair, named Amelia?


557
00:31:05.520 --> 00:31:07.112
Nope.

558
00:31:07.280 --> 00:31:09.077
- Saw that famous chick.
- What famous chick?


559
00:31:09.240 --> 00:31:11.231
Dead one. Porn star. 
Misty something.

560
00:31:11.400 --> 00:31:13.709
- You saw Misty Mountains here?
- Yeah.


561
00:31:13.880 --> 00:31:16.155
Talked to the producer.

562
00:31:16.320 --> 00:31:20.836
No, his name was Sid... Sid Hatrack. Yeah.

563
00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:22.592
Nobody's name is Hatrack.

564
00:31:22.760 --> 00:31:24.273
Whatever. Tried to get a job.

565
00:31:24.480 --> 00:31:28.075
I offered to show my dick
'cause I got a big dick.


566
00:31:29.600 --> 00:31:31.079
- Oh, right.
- Yeah.


567
00:31:31.400 --> 00:31:33.080
Well, that's very nice.

568
00:31:33.120 --> 00:31:34.120
Yeah.

569
00:31:34.320 --> 00:31:36.072
You sure you didn't see another girl?

570
00:31:36.280 --> 00:31:38.635
Nope. You guys wanna see my dick?

571
00:31:38.800 --> 00:31:41.360
Nobody wants to see your dick, dude.

572
00:31:42.320 --> 00:31:44.276
- Twenty bucks?
- We already paid you 20...


573
00:31:44.440 --> 00:31:45.714
What am I saying?

574
00:31:45.880 --> 00:31:47.154
Oh, all right.

575
00:31:48.320 --> 00:31:49.435
Fags!

576
00:31:51.160 --> 00:31:52.388
Hey, kid.

577
00:31:53.640 --> 00:31:54.640
What?

578
00:31:54.840 --> 00:31:56.717
What was the name of that film?

579
00:31:59.240 --> 00:32:00.798
I don't know. Uh...

580
00:32:01.280 --> 00:32:02.713
<i>How Do You Like My Car, Big Boy?</i>

581
00:32:02.880 --> 00:32:04.108
There it is.

582
00:32:10.840 --> 00:32:14.310
"Do you wanna see my dick?" Unbelievable.

583
00:32:14.480 --> 00:32:15.720
This is what I'm talking about.

584
00:32:15.840 --> 00:32:17.068
It's over.

585
00:32:17.280 --> 00:32:18.776
<i>The days of ladies and gentlemen are over.</i>

586
00:32:18.800 --> 00:32:20.616
This is what Holly's
looking down the barrel of.


587
00:32:20.640 --> 00:32:24.394
This is what she's dealing with,
the fucking Chets and that idiot.


588
00:32:25.720 --> 00:32:28.234
Well, one thing we know for sure,
something funny's going on.


589
00:32:28.400 --> 00:32:30.152
No, there's not. No.

590
00:32:30.320 --> 00:32:31.912
A guy burned up. It happens.

591
00:32:32.080 --> 00:32:33.160
It happened three days ago,

592
00:32:33.240 --> 00:32:36.232
the exact same day
Amelia fell off my radar.


593
00:32:36.400 --> 00:32:37.799
Your radar?

594
00:32:39.560 --> 00:32:42.597
<i>Let me tell you what two days
of detective work looks like, okay?</i>


595
00:32:42.760 --> 00:32:44.239
You drive around like an asshole.

596
00:32:44.400 --> 00:32:45.576
You're gonna spend half the time

597
00:32:45.600 --> 00:32:47.320
interviewing the fucking Chets
of the world.


598
00:32:47.560 --> 00:32:50.393
<i>You spend the other half trying
to translate fuckwit to English.</i>


599
00:32:50.560 --> 00:32:52.480
And when it's over,
the only thing that's changed


600
00:32:52.560 --> 00:32:54.357
is that the sun went down twice.

601
00:32:54.520 --> 00:32:56.736
And nothing ever works out,
is that what you're trying to say?


602
00:32:56.760 --> 00:32:57.760
Never.

603
00:32:57.920 --> 00:32:59.239
But you get paid.

604
00:32:59.400 --> 00:33:00.719
Sometimes.

605
00:33:01.520 --> 00:33:02.555
Hey.

606
00:33:03.840 --> 00:33:05.398
Son of a bitch.

607
00:33:05.560 --> 00:33:06.675
Hatrack.

608
00:33:06.840 --> 00:33:07.840
What?

609
00:33:08.040 --> 00:33:09.189
Hatrack. Look at that.

610
00:33:09.360 --> 00:33:10.475
What?

611
00:33:13.200 --> 00:33:15.509
<i>Sid Shattuck. 
Who's that?</i>

612
00:33:15.680 --> 00:33:17.796
<i>Savage Sid, the porn king.</i>

613
00:33:17.960 --> 00:33:20.758
Well, he didn't burn up,
so let's go talk to him.


614
00:33:20.920 --> 00:33:23.275
I said I'd like to speak
to Sid personally.


615
00:33:23.440 --> 00:33:26.955
<i>I'm asking after a friend of ours, Amelia.</i>

616
00:33:28.200 --> 00:33:29.599
<i>I'm an old friend.</i>

617
00:33:29.760 --> 00:33:31.557
Why don't we invite him in?

618
00:33:31.720 --> 00:33:34.393
No animals in the house, sweetheart.

619
00:33:34.560 --> 00:33:36.073
Yeah, I'm here.

620
00:33:37.040 --> 00:33:38.871
<i>Say that again.</i>

621
00:33:39.040 --> 00:33:41.508
Okay. Thank you very much.

622
00:33:41.680 --> 00:33:44.831
Is that the number you got
for Sid Shattuck?


623
00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:47.753
Yeah. Can you hang this up?

624
00:33:49.640 --> 00:33:52.200
They're getting ready for a party
and I asked about Amelia


625
00:33:52.360 --> 00:33:53.759
and they said she'd be right back.

626
00:33:53.960 --> 00:33:55.951
Back? Like she's been staying there?

627
00:33:56.120 --> 00:33:57.473
Yeah.

628
00:33:57.640 --> 00:33:59.278
- So you found her?
<i>- Maybe.</i>


629
00:34:01.080 --> 00:34:02.991
Can you stay at one of your friends?

630
00:34:03.160 --> 00:34:05.151
I can stay with Jessica, but...

631
00:34:05.320 --> 00:34:06.878
- You're going to a party?
- No.


632
00:34:07.040 --> 00:34:10.191
I'm going to a big party. Jacket.

633
00:34:13.920 --> 00:34:16.150
Sweetheart, it's a job. 
I gotta take it.

634
00:34:16.360 --> 00:34:19.033
If I don't, we won't get to live
in such a nice house.


635
00:34:19.200 --> 00:34:20.599
I hate this house.

636
00:34:20.760 --> 00:34:22.273
We're not even supposed to be here.

637
00:34:23.600 --> 00:34:25.272
- Go to Janet's.
- Jessica's.


638
00:34:25.440 --> 00:34:27.476
- Which one's she?
- The one with the brown hair.


639
00:34:27.680 --> 00:34:29.033
Glass eye?

640
00:34:29.200 --> 00:34:30.519
The one that you like.

641
00:34:30.680 --> 00:34:32.398
And like the Hitler-stache?

642
00:34:40.840 --> 00:34:42.956
I'm friends with a cop, you know.

643
00:34:43.120 --> 00:34:44.155
Is that so?

644
00:34:44.480 --> 00:34:46.357
He likes my dad a lot, too.

645
00:34:46.520 --> 00:34:48.750
Maybe they should get married.

646
00:34:55.600 --> 00:34:57.280
So, you know the old lady, right?

647
00:34:57.440 --> 00:34:58.589
Did you believe her?

648
00:34:58.760 --> 00:34:59.909
What about?

649
00:35:00.080 --> 00:35:01.736
When she said she saw
Misty alive that night,


650
00:35:01.760 --> 00:35:02.795
did you believe her?

651
00:35:02.960 --> 00:35:04.279
God, no.

652
00:35:04.440 --> 00:35:06.317
- She's blind as a bat.
<i>- Uh-huh.</i>


653
00:35:06.720 --> 00:35:08.995
She has actual coke bottles for glasses.

654
00:35:09.200 --> 00:35:11.040
<i>You paint a mustache
on a Volkswagen, she says,</i>


655
00:35:11.160 --> 00:35:13.674
<i>"Boy, that Omar Sharif sure runs fast."</i>

656
00:35:35.160 --> 00:35:38.038
Jesus tap-dancing Christ!

657
00:35:38.200 --> 00:35:40.191
All I told him was that
if you want me to do that,


658
00:35:40.400 --> 00:35:42.470
then don't eat the asparagus.

659
00:35:42.640 --> 00:35:43.834
<i>Why?</i>

660
00:35:52.160 --> 00:35:55.436
I know what you're gonna say,
but since I'm already here,


661
00:35:55.600 --> 00:35:58.068
you might as well
take me in with you, right?


662
00:36:03.360 --> 00:36:06.432
Um, I can't take your car like that.

663
00:36:08.120 --> 00:36:09.155
- Stop it.
- What?


664
00:36:09.320 --> 00:36:11.959
Stop it. Stop it. Dad.

665
00:36:12.800 --> 00:36:14.870
Dad, there's like whores here and stuff.

666
00:36:15.040 --> 00:36:16.336
Sweetheart, how many times
have I told you?


667
00:36:16.360 --> 00:36:17.554
Don't say "and stuff."

668
00:36:17.720 --> 00:36:19.216
Just say, "Dad, there are whores here."

669
00:36:19.240 --> 00:36:23.233
Well, there's like a ton.
Wait. No. I can help you.


670
00:36:23.440 --> 00:36:24.919
<i>Seriously? I came all this way.</i>

671
00:36:25.080 --> 00:36:26.479
I love you.

672
00:36:48.320 --> 00:36:50.072
It's not my nose that grows.

673
00:36:58.520 --> 00:37:01.592
Whoa. Well, we know Mary Jane turned up.

674
00:37:01.760 --> 00:37:02.760
Who's that?

675
00:37:02.920 --> 00:37:05.354
Mary Jane. Marijuana. Pot.

676
00:37:05.520 --> 00:37:06.896
Place reeks of it. 
They're smoking it.

677
00:37:06.920 --> 00:37:10.230
- Oh, yeah. I can't smell.
- What?


678
00:37:10.400 --> 00:37:11.696
I got hit in
the head a while back.

679
00:37:11.720 --> 00:37:13.915
I lost my sense of smell.

680
00:37:14.440 --> 00:37:16.112
You can't smell?

681
00:37:17.200 --> 00:37:18.235
- Yeah.
- Wow.


682
00:37:18.400 --> 00:37:19.736
You're a detective who can't smell?

683
00:37:19.760 --> 00:37:20.760
Yeah.

684
00:37:20.960 --> 00:37:23.633
Oh, this just keeps getting
better and better.


685
00:37:23.840 --> 00:37:26.400
Wow, that's really insensitive.

686
00:37:29.320 --> 00:37:31.296
Look, if Amelia doesn't show,

687
00:37:31.320 --> 00:37:32.958
we still got Shattuck, right?

688
00:37:33.120 --> 00:37:36.271
But if things get rough, I'm injured.

689
00:37:36.440 --> 00:37:38.496
- So you're gonna have to handle it.
- Right.


690
00:37:38.520 --> 00:37:40.536
Well, you know, blind his son,
or, you know, whatever it is.


691
00:37:40.560 --> 00:37:41.896
You work your magic. 
Where you going?

692
00:37:41.920 --> 00:37:44.480
I think this is gonna work better,
faster, if we split up.


693
00:37:44.640 --> 00:37:45.755
- Okay?
- What?


694
00:37:45.920 --> 00:37:48.480
You see a guy with a blue face,
you come and find me.


695
00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:52.638
You wanna smoke?

696
00:37:55.680 --> 00:37:56.954
Drink?

697
00:37:58.040 --> 00:37:59.473
No, I...

698
00:38:21.040 --> 00:38:23.600
Hey, uh... Sorry.

699
00:38:27.080 --> 00:38:28.433
It's the killer bees.

700
00:38:28.600 --> 00:38:29.960
That's what you gotta worry about.

701
00:38:30.080 --> 00:38:31.936
<i>You know why they call them
killer bees, don't you?</i>


702
00:38:31.960 --> 00:38:33.678
'Cause they'll kill you.

703
00:38:33.840 --> 00:38:35.193
Good point.

704
00:38:38.480 --> 00:38:40.436
- Excuse me.
- Hello, handsome.


705
00:38:40.600 --> 00:38:43.114
You, uh, seem to have a very
good vantage point up there.


706
00:38:43.280 --> 00:38:44.952
- I lost my sister.
- Yeah.


707
00:38:45.120 --> 00:38:47.031
She's got dark hair, your height.

708
00:38:47.200 --> 00:38:48.519
She's wearing clothes, but...

709
00:38:48.680 --> 00:38:50.272
<i>Come on, baby, keep dancing!</i>

710
00:38:50.440 --> 00:38:51.509
Answers to Amelia.

711
00:38:51.680 --> 00:38:53.432
Hey. You want another drink?

712
00:38:53.600 --> 00:38:54.953
Just leave the girl alone.

713
00:39:20.160 --> 00:39:21.309
- Hi, everyone.
- Hey.


714
00:39:21.480 --> 00:39:23.835
I'm Amelia. She's about dark hair.

715
00:39:24.040 --> 00:39:27.999
Answers to the call of the wild.

716
00:39:28.160 --> 00:39:29.416
- I'm just kidding.
- What?


717
00:39:29.440 --> 00:39:31.336
I forgot her name,
but, you know, if you see you,


718
00:39:31.360 --> 00:39:35.069
just if you see,
let me know and tell me my name.


719
00:40:01.720 --> 00:40:02.755
- Sorry.
- Thank you.


720
00:40:02.920 --> 00:40:04.990
- You want a drink?
- No, thanks.


721
00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:19.000
Ow!

722
00:40:27.640 --> 00:40:29.256
Holly. Hey, hey.

723
00:40:29.280 --> 00:40:31.271
I don't think you should be watching this.

724
00:40:31.480 --> 00:40:34.790
What's it to you, idiot?
Move. You're in my way.


725
00:40:36.560 --> 00:40:39.472
Listen, dickweed,
that little girl's a minor.


726
00:40:39.640 --> 00:40:41.696
Where do you get off showing
her stuff like this anyway?


727
00:40:41.720 --> 00:40:43.073
He's not showing it to me.

728
00:40:43.800 --> 00:40:45.631
She put it on.

729
00:40:45.800 --> 00:40:47.960
Well, she shouldn't be
watching stuff like this either.


730
00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:49.319
Watching it?

731
00:40:49.480 --> 00:40:51.152
Man, I'm in it.

732
00:40:53.800 --> 00:40:56.553
Oh, right. Look, go home, right?

733
00:40:56.760 --> 00:40:59.399
Your dad told you
to go home. Go home.

734
00:41:00.760 --> 00:41:03.672
By the way, I'm supposed
to meet someone here.


735
00:41:03.840 --> 00:41:06.400
Do you by any chance
know a girl named Amelia?


736
00:41:06.600 --> 00:41:09.160
I think she did
a film with Sid Shattuck.

737
00:41:09.320 --> 00:41:11.754
Don't know her, but Sid's gross.

738
00:41:11.920 --> 00:41:13.831
He told me this one chick
was his sister, right,


739
00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:16.275
and then a few days later
I walk in on them


740
00:41:16.440 --> 00:41:18.670
and they're all doing anal and stuff.

741
00:41:20.600 --> 00:41:22.158
Don't say, "and stuff."

742
00:41:22.320 --> 00:41:24.276
Just say, "They're doing anal."

743
00:41:29.200 --> 00:41:30.792
<i>Hey, Pocahontas!</i>

744
00:41:41.280 --> 00:41:42.280
Hey.

745
00:41:42.440 --> 00:41:43.714
I'm a cowboy.

746
00:41:43.880 --> 00:41:45.029
And you?

747
00:41:45.200 --> 00:41:46.599
Pocahontas.

748
00:41:47.360 --> 00:41:48.554
What do you do?

749
00:41:48.720 --> 00:41:51.029
- I do a little bit of acting.
- Me, too.


750
00:41:51.200 --> 00:41:52.553
- Hey, shoot me.
- What?


751
00:41:52.720 --> 00:41:54.416
Shoot me, shoot me, shoot me.
Fucking shoot me.


752
00:41:54.440 --> 00:41:55.555
Bang!

753
00:41:55.720 --> 00:41:56.948
That's pretty good.

754
00:41:57.120 --> 00:41:58.838
- Bang!
- Oh.


755
00:41:59.040 --> 00:42:00.393
<i>Bang!</i>

756
00:42:07.120 --> 00:42:08.439
Son of a...

757
00:42:15.720 --> 00:42:18.154
Whoo! That was great!

758
00:42:27.920 --> 00:42:29.035
Shit.

759
00:42:31.080 --> 00:42:32.149
Shit!

760
00:42:33.240 --> 00:42:34.878
My fucking gun.

761
00:42:40.920 --> 00:42:42.831
Jesus.

762
00:42:43.760 --> 00:42:45.478
You scared me.

763
00:42:48.600 --> 00:42:49.635
Do I know you?

764
00:42:51.320 --> 00:42:53.276
I'm not gonna hurt you.

765
00:42:53.680 --> 00:42:55.750
No, I'm just looking for my gun.

766
00:42:56.600 --> 00:42:58.113
So...

767
00:43:09.480 --> 00:43:10.799
I got it!

768
00:43:13.960 --> 00:43:15.109
So...

769
00:43:19.120 --> 00:43:20.872
There you go, March.

770
00:43:21.640 --> 00:43:25.474
March, March, he's our man.
If he can't do it, no one can.


771
00:43:27.320 --> 00:43:28.799
March.

772
00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:05.353
March!

773
00:44:06.440 --> 00:44:07.759
<i>March!</i>

774
00:44:32.800 --> 00:44:34.836
Healy. Healy!

775
00:44:35.160 --> 00:44:36.513
Healy!

776
00:44:37.320 --> 00:44:38.514
Healy!

777
00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:41.035
Healy!

778
00:44:43.400 --> 00:44:44.799
Come on! Come down here!

779
00:44:44.960 --> 00:44:47.235
What the fuck are you doing down there?

780
00:44:47.400 --> 00:44:49.391
Get down here!

781
00:44:51.240 --> 00:44:53.231
- Healy!
- It's all right, man.


782
00:44:53.400 --> 00:44:54.719
What?

783
00:44:54.880 --> 00:44:55.880
Oh, fuck.

784
00:44:56.080 --> 00:44:58.469
- I'm gonna be sick, throw up.
- Oh!


785
00:44:58.720 --> 00:45:01.075
Who the fuck is that?

786
00:45:10.120 --> 00:45:11.394
It's Sid Shattuck.

787
00:45:13.600 --> 00:45:15.795
- That's Sid Shattuck.
- Don't tell me that.


788
00:45:16.160 --> 00:45:18.754
Oh, no. Shit!

789
00:45:18.920 --> 00:45:20.592
- What's going on?
<i>- Shit!</i>


790
00:45:20.760 --> 00:45:23.228
Everybody worked
on this Amelia flick, right?


791
00:45:23.440 --> 00:45:25.908
The boyfriend, then Misty,

792
00:45:26.080 --> 00:45:27.991
now Sid. They're all dead.

793
00:45:28.160 --> 00:45:30.549
Before we go solving
the crime of the century,


794
00:45:30.720 --> 00:45:32.915
let's deal with
the fucking rotting corpse.


795
00:45:33.120 --> 00:45:34.296
What the fuck
are we gonna do with this guy?


796
00:45:34.320 --> 00:45:35.673
- We gotta get rid of him.
- Why?


797
00:45:35.840 --> 00:45:36.875
I lost my gun.

798
00:45:37.080 --> 00:45:38.957
There was a girl. 
She can place me.

799
00:45:39.120 --> 00:45:41.236
All right, we got a plan.

800
00:45:41.760 --> 00:45:44.399
We'll throw up, we'll
get rid of the body.

801
00:45:44.560 --> 00:45:46.073
Right.

802
00:45:49.040 --> 00:45:50.075
Hey.

803
00:45:50.240 --> 00:45:51.240
Hi.

804
00:45:51.400 --> 00:45:54.597
Are you the one who's been
asking about Amelia?


805
00:45:54.760 --> 00:45:56.751
Uh, I may have said something.

806
00:45:56.920 --> 00:45:58.592
What do you want with her?

807
00:45:58.760 --> 00:46:00.955
Um, she's my sister, see.

808
00:46:01.120 --> 00:46:02.917
Yeah, um, I need to warn her.

809
00:46:03.080 --> 00:46:05.594
Two freaky guys were coming around.

810
00:46:05.760 --> 00:46:08.593
They were all like,
"Where is she? Where is she?"


811
00:46:08.760 --> 00:46:10.557
It scared me kinda.

812
00:46:10.720 --> 00:46:12.040
Well, you seem like a decent kid.

813
00:46:12.240 --> 00:46:13.593
I'll take you to her.

814
00:46:14.640 --> 00:46:15.709
- Come on.
- Okay.


815
00:46:15.880 --> 00:46:20.715
What I can't figure out is how you saw him
from all the way up there.


816
00:46:20.880 --> 00:46:24.156
You didn't fall down
the fucking hill, did you?


817
00:46:24.320 --> 00:46:25.400
Did you fall down the hill?

818
00:46:25.560 --> 00:46:27.630
I had, like, two, three drinks, tops.

819
00:46:27.840 --> 00:46:29.096
Yeah, that's why you can't walk straight.

820
00:46:29.120 --> 00:46:31.936
Oh, excuse me. I'm carrying a dead body
and I have his schwantz in my face.


821
00:46:31.960 --> 00:46:34.110
So, I'm sorry I'm not Bakishnarov.

822
00:46:34.280 --> 00:46:36.157
You can't even say Baryshnikov.

823
00:46:36.320 --> 00:46:37.320
You did, didn't you?

824
00:46:37.480 --> 00:46:39.232
You fell down that fucking hill.

825
00:46:39.400 --> 00:46:41.595
You get drunk, you lose your gun,

826
00:46:41.760 --> 00:46:44.479
you take a header off the balcony,
and now you're gonna tell me


827
00:46:44.640 --> 00:46:48.155
it's like a hallowed,
time-honored detective ploy, right?


828
00:46:48.360 --> 00:46:49.800
It was very slippery up there, okay?

829
00:46:49.840 --> 00:46:51.671
I was in the pool.

830
00:46:51.840 --> 00:46:53.592
- You were in the pool?
- Yeah.


831
00:46:53.760 --> 00:46:54.795
Why?

832
00:46:54.960 --> 00:46:56.757
I had to question the mermaids.

833
00:46:56.920 --> 00:46:59.434
What were you doing while I was working?

834
00:47:00.680 --> 00:47:02.318
- Thank you.
- Let's get rid of this guy.


835
00:47:02.480 --> 00:47:03.629
Oh, God.

836
00:47:12.960 --> 00:47:14.234
Oh, God! My leg! My leg!

837
00:47:14.400 --> 00:47:15.800
<i>What is that?</i>

838
00:47:16.320 --> 00:47:17.435
Run.

839
00:47:19.280 --> 00:47:21.157
Hop in back, sweetie.

840
00:47:22.640 --> 00:47:25.200
This one says she's Amelia's sister.

841
00:47:29.720 --> 00:47:31.358
Is that a fact?

842
00:47:33.440 --> 00:47:35.874
Good times.

843
00:47:36.520 --> 00:47:38.397
I... There's someone out looking for me.

844
00:47:38.560 --> 00:47:39.920
- Really?
- Yeah. I...


845
00:47:40.080 --> 00:47:42.116
Hey, hey, hey. No. 
Don't touch that.

846
00:47:47.560 --> 00:47:49.915
Hey. Why didn't you watch my movie?

847
00:47:50.080 --> 00:47:52.040
- Hey, goodbye.
- Come and watch with me.


848
00:47:52.080 --> 00:47:53.736
- Have a great night.
- Come on. It's still playing.


849
00:47:53.760 --> 00:47:55.512
Have a great night. Bye.

850
00:48:38.240 --> 00:48:39.416
Excuse me, excuse me.

851
00:48:39.440 --> 00:48:41.176
- I need to go right now.
- Don't touch...


852
00:48:41.200 --> 00:48:42.200
Get away from me!

853
00:48:42.360 --> 00:48:43.776
<i>I need my keys. 
I need my car.</i>

854
00:48:43.800 --> 00:48:44.915
Hurry.

855
00:48:45.680 --> 00:48:47.159
Don't fucking move.

856
00:48:47.320 --> 00:48:48.719
<i>Hurry. I need my keys.</i>

857
00:48:50.560 --> 00:48:52.630
Hello? Please! Hurry, hurry.

858
00:48:53.840 --> 00:48:54.875
<i>Now!</i>

859
00:49:01.160 --> 00:49:04.152
Fuck! Motherfucker, my fucking hand!

860
00:49:04.320 --> 00:49:06.675
Amelia! Run!

861
00:49:19.840 --> 00:49:21.159
Drive the fucking car!

862
00:49:29.520 --> 00:49:30.873
Hey, man.

863
00:49:31.040 --> 00:49:34.237
The girl in your trunk,
she was in that car.


864
00:49:42.320 --> 00:49:43.320
<i>Johnny's car!</i>

865
00:49:43.480 --> 00:49:45.596
<i>Hey, man,
what are you doing with my car?</i>


866
00:49:45.760 --> 00:49:47.536
<i>That's Johnny's car!</i>

867
00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:04.513
Motherfucker!

868
00:50:11.360 --> 00:50:12.475
<i>Oh, shit.</i>

869
00:50:26.880 --> 00:50:30.793
I swear to God, you get up,
I'll shoot you in the cock.


870
00:50:31.000 --> 00:50:33.389
I can pay you.

871
00:50:33.560 --> 00:50:35.915
Trying to negotiate with me?

872
00:50:36.080 --> 00:50:38.071
You'll never see me again.

873
00:50:38.240 --> 00:50:39.514
Where are you gonna be?

874
00:50:40.360 --> 00:50:41.713
Michigan.

875
00:50:42.240 --> 00:50:43.798
Michigan works.

876
00:51:24.880 --> 00:51:27.075
You okay? Does the car still go?

877
00:51:27.240 --> 00:51:28.832
Well, stop fucking around. Come on!

878
00:51:38.200 --> 00:51:40.077
Fuck!

879
00:51:43.080 --> 00:51:44.308
Freeze!

880
00:51:44.960 --> 00:51:46.473
You guys are fast.

881
00:51:46.800 --> 00:51:47.800
Whoo!

882
00:51:48.160 --> 00:51:50.230
There's a...

883
00:51:56.320 --> 00:51:57.639
Holy shit!

884
00:52:02.000 --> 00:52:03.831
- Come on.
- Wait, wait.


885
00:52:04.000 --> 00:52:05.136
<i>What the hell are you doing?</i>

886
00:52:05.160 --> 00:52:06.832
<i>He's hurt. We need to help him.</i>

887
00:52:07.000 --> 00:52:08.991
Are you crazy? 
Stay away from him!

888
00:52:09.160 --> 00:52:12.152
Just hang on. We need to help him.

889
00:52:32.200 --> 00:52:33.713
It's okay.

890
00:52:33.960 --> 00:52:36.110
You're gonna be all right.

891
00:52:36.280 --> 00:52:38.077
I'll get help.

892
00:52:38.680 --> 00:52:40.193
It's all right.

893
00:52:42.920 --> 00:52:45.673
A car hit him. 
We need an ambulance.

894
00:52:45.880 --> 00:52:48.110
Holly, go and see
if you can flag somebody down.


895
00:52:48.280 --> 00:52:49.280
He's in a bad way.

896
00:52:59.080 --> 00:53:00.195
You.

897
00:53:00.840 --> 00:53:02.239
Yeah, me.

898
00:53:05.320 --> 00:53:08.312
You ever hear of John Boy?

899
00:53:08.480 --> 00:53:10.471
By now he's heard of you.

900
00:53:12.880 --> 00:53:14.871
They're flying him in.

901
00:53:16.480 --> 00:53:19.358
Now he's gonna kill that private cop

902
00:53:19.520 --> 00:53:21.317
and his whole fucking family.

903
00:53:22.480 --> 00:53:24.710
<i>And then he's gonna come for you.</i>

904
00:53:25.880 --> 00:53:28.713
You ain't got long to live.

905
00:53:29.400 --> 00:53:30.833
Well, buddy,

906
00:53:33.720 --> 00:53:35.233
none of us do.

907
00:53:48.000 --> 00:53:49.433
Healy, there's no one here.

908
00:53:49.600 --> 00:53:51.158
He didn't make it.

909
00:54:13.800 --> 00:54:15.791
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.


910
00:54:26.120 --> 00:54:27.633
And that'll be the cops.

911
00:54:28.800 --> 00:54:29.800
<i>Okay, Holly...</i>

912
00:54:29.960 --> 00:54:31.296
What do you want me
to do with them?


913
00:54:31.320 --> 00:54:33.000
Look, pal, you already got our statements.

914
00:54:33.160 --> 00:54:34.798
Can I go see my daughter now?

915
00:54:34.960 --> 00:54:37.474
Sir, I was told to keep you here,
so I'm keeping you here.


916
00:54:37.640 --> 00:54:39.676
Just following orders.

917
00:54:39.840 --> 00:54:42.115
You know who else was
just following orders? Hitler.


918
00:54:44.920 --> 00:54:45.989
Officer.

919
00:54:48.680 --> 00:54:50.272
You're Mr. March, I think.

920
00:54:50.440 --> 00:54:52.829
And you are...
Wait, I know you.


921
00:54:53.000 --> 00:54:56.436
You're the guy.
The diner guy, right?


922
00:54:56.640 --> 00:54:58.312
From last year, right?

923
00:54:58.480 --> 00:54:59.674
Yeah.

924
00:54:59.840 --> 00:55:00.989
Yeah. My name is Tally.

925
00:55:01.160 --> 00:55:04.516
If you'll follow me,
my boss would like a word. Please.


926
00:55:08.000 --> 00:55:10.992
I'm sorry. The diner guy?

927
00:55:11.160 --> 00:55:13.754
I'll tell you later. 
Don't worry about it.

928
00:55:16.440 --> 00:55:18.112
How do you do?

929
00:55:18.280 --> 00:55:20.157
About this good most of the time.

930
00:55:20.320 --> 00:55:23.198
My name is Judith Kuttner.

931
00:55:23.360 --> 00:55:25.749
I work for the Department of Justice.

932
00:55:25.960 --> 00:55:28.633
Okay. Well, that explains
basically nothing.


933
00:55:28.840 --> 00:55:30.876
I'm Amelia's mother.

934
00:55:34.720 --> 00:55:37.154
<i>Holly, are you still frowning?</i>

935
00:55:37.320 --> 00:55:39.038
<i>What's in my hand?</i>

936
00:55:39.360 --> 00:55:40.952
What?

937
00:55:43.040 --> 00:55:44.951
<i>I know how you do that.</i>

938
00:55:45.280 --> 00:55:46.474
Hello.

939
00:55:47.320 --> 00:55:48.673
Sit.

940
00:55:49.200 --> 00:55:52.033
First of all, I wanna say thank you.

941
00:55:52.200 --> 00:55:53.872
We've been watching interviews

942
00:55:54.040 --> 00:55:56.554
and it sounds like
you might have saved my daughter's life.


943
00:55:56.720 --> 00:55:58.597
That was mostly Holly.

944
00:55:59.720 --> 00:56:01.870
<i>- His daughter.</i>
- It's genetics.


945
00:56:03.800 --> 00:56:05.358
Would you like a mint?

946
00:56:07.480 --> 00:56:08.595
Uh, yeah.

947
00:56:09.480 --> 00:56:11.198
<i>I need your help.</i>

948
00:56:12.000 --> 00:56:14.309
But I wanna know
if I can trust you.

949
00:56:14.480 --> 00:56:18.951
I'm kinda getting the idea that, you know,
you might not have much choice.


950
00:56:19.120 --> 00:56:21.680
Well, my situation is very delicate.

951
00:56:21.840 --> 00:56:24.308
Hey, that's where I know
you from, right? The TV.


952
00:56:24.520 --> 00:56:27.637
You're prosecuting that car company thing.

953
00:56:27.800 --> 00:56:29.518
The lawsuit for the catalytic converter.

954
00:56:29.680 --> 00:56:31.511
Yes. That's half my day.

955
00:56:31.680 --> 00:56:34.911
The other half I spend on pornography.

956
00:56:35.520 --> 00:56:37.272
- Hmm.
- What kind? Like which films?


957
00:56:37.440 --> 00:56:39.476
- What's your favorite?
- No, no.


958
00:56:39.880 --> 00:56:41.950
Uh, anti. Anti-porn.

959
00:56:42.160 --> 00:56:43.832
- Right.
- Like a crusader.


960
00:56:44.040 --> 00:56:45.314
Should I be writing this down?

961
00:56:45.480 --> 00:56:46.959
<i>Yeah, write it down.</i>

962
00:56:47.760 --> 00:56:51.514
<i>The Vegas mob is trying to
spread its porn operation</i>


963
00:56:51.680 --> 00:56:53.272
to Hollywood Boulevard.

964
00:56:53.440 --> 00:56:55.510
<i>And I'm doing
everything I can to stop it.</i>


965
00:56:55.680 --> 00:56:57.033
Thank you.

966
00:56:58.360 --> 00:57:00.078
Porn is bad.

967
00:57:00.240 --> 00:57:02.356
Something I don't understand.
Your daughter,


968
00:57:02.520 --> 00:57:04.636
she did a film with Sid Shattuck.

969
00:57:04.800 --> 00:57:07.553
<i>Now, why would she do that
when she knows that's just gonna be</i>


970
00:57:07.720 --> 00:57:09.597
extremely professionally
embarrassing for you?


971
00:57:09.760 --> 00:57:11.796
'Cause she wanted to. 
She lashes out.

972
00:57:11.960 --> 00:57:13.280
We have a difficult relationship.

973
00:57:13.320 --> 00:57:15.311
Mothers and daughters, it's tough.

974
00:57:15.480 --> 00:57:17.436
But there's no film, not anymore.

975
00:57:17.600 --> 00:57:19.272
There was a fire.

976
00:57:19.440 --> 00:57:20.440
Um...

977
00:57:20.840 --> 00:57:23.115
- A friend of Amelia's, he...
- Dean.


978
00:57:24.280 --> 00:57:25.360
Yeah, we went to his house.

979
00:57:25.520 --> 00:57:26.760
Well, what's left of his house.

980
00:57:26.880 --> 00:57:30.350
Mrs. Kuttner, why do you think
everyone involved with this film is dying?


981
00:57:30.520 --> 00:57:32.397
I have no idea, Mr. March.

982
00:57:32.560 --> 00:57:34.198
I wish I did.

983
00:57:34.360 --> 00:57:36.954
I only know that Amelia's in danger.

984
00:57:37.120 --> 00:57:38.776
Why don't you put her
in protective custody?


985
00:57:38.800 --> 00:57:41.234
<i>I mean, after tonight
she's probably very scared.</i>


986
00:57:41.400 --> 00:57:44.233
She might wanna be at home.

987
00:57:45.040 --> 00:57:46.393
She doesn't trust me.

988
00:57:46.600 --> 00:57:48.989
She thinks I am the government.

989
00:57:49.160 --> 00:57:51.628
She thinks I'm behind all of this.

990
00:57:51.800 --> 00:57:55.236
Somewhere she's out there
and she won't call home


991
00:57:55.440 --> 00:57:58.671
because she thinks
her mother's going to have her killed.


992
00:58:02.040 --> 00:58:03.758
Here. You wanna use that?

993
00:58:03.920 --> 00:58:05.239
No, thank you.

994
00:58:07.600 --> 00:58:08.600
I wanna hire you both.

995
00:58:08.760 --> 00:58:12.673
Please, find her, protect her.

996
00:58:12.840 --> 00:58:15.479
Okay, you can hire us,
but we're not cheap.


997
00:58:15.640 --> 00:58:19.269
This is very intensive work
and something like this,


998
00:58:19.440 --> 00:58:23.718
I'd say couldn't do it
for less than $5,000.


999
00:58:25.200 --> 00:58:26.428
<i>Okay.</i>

1000
00:58:31.600 --> 00:58:32.749
Yes, I got it.

1001
00:58:32.920 --> 00:58:34.876
Okay, I gotta get mine now.

1002
00:58:36.120 --> 00:58:37.155
Can I take this?

1003
00:58:37.360 --> 00:58:38.509
Fine.

1004
00:58:38.680 --> 00:58:42.036
Does Tally have one of...
Shall we have hers as well?


1005
00:58:42.800 --> 00:58:44.199
Just in case you're not...

1006
00:58:44.360 --> 00:58:47.079
You know, we need
to get in touch with somebody.


1007
00:59:02.840 --> 00:59:04.068
<i>So what's this?</i>

1008
00:59:04.240 --> 00:59:06.595
World's biggest ashtray?

1009
00:59:07.040 --> 00:59:09.918
Fuck it, it's... 
It's a rental.

1010
00:59:11.200 --> 00:59:13.589
We're only here until we
rebuild the old place anyway.


1011
00:59:13.760 --> 00:59:15.432
Rebuild?

1012
00:59:15.600 --> 00:59:16.794
Yeah.

1013
00:59:16.960 --> 00:59:18.757
It burned down.

1014
00:59:21.480 --> 00:59:23.320
<i>Hey, you know, something's
actually bugging me.</i>


1015
00:59:23.440 --> 00:59:25.635
I found this in Shattuck's office.

1016
00:59:28.160 --> 00:59:30.276
What is that, a pig?

1017
00:59:30.440 --> 00:59:32.829
- No, it's a pink cow.
- Oh, it's a cow.


1018
00:59:33.040 --> 00:59:35.076
When Amelia gave me your address,

1019
00:59:35.240 --> 00:59:36.736
she gave it to me
on a piece of paper like this,


1020
00:59:36.760 --> 00:59:37.909
handwriting like that.

1021
00:59:38.080 --> 00:59:39.760
- I think you're onto something.
<i>- Mmm-hmm.</i>


1022
00:59:39.840 --> 00:59:42.434
Can we talk about it tomorrow afternoon?

1023
00:59:43.160 --> 00:59:45.720
Yeah, we can do that.

1024
00:59:45.880 --> 00:59:47.279
Thanks.

1025
00:59:50.400 --> 00:59:52.834
Hey, aren't you that diner guy?

1026
00:59:54.400 --> 00:59:55.656
Come on, come on, come on,
come on, come on.


1027
00:59:55.680 --> 00:59:56.680
I gotta know.

1028
00:59:56.840 --> 00:59:58.136
I don't wanna get into it right now.

1029
00:59:58.160 --> 00:59:59.195
You gotta get into it.

1030
00:59:59.440 --> 01:00:02.989
I gotta know. You're the diner guy.

1031
01:00:03.320 --> 01:00:05.072
- All right.
- Yes.


1032
01:00:05.760 --> 01:00:07.910
- All right, about a year ago...
- Yes.


1033
01:00:08.120 --> 01:00:09.633
<i>...I was at a diner in Hollywood</i>

1034
01:00:09.800 --> 01:00:12.314
and this asshole with a shotgun
started threatening people.


1035
01:00:12.480 --> 01:00:13.754
<i>I love it.</i>

1036
01:00:13.920 --> 01:00:15.360
It's the best story I've ever heard.

1037
01:00:15.440 --> 01:00:16.953
<i>So I did something about it.</i>

1038
01:00:17.120 --> 01:00:18.155
<i>I acted.</i>

1039
01:00:18.320 --> 01:00:20.993
I didn't plan to, 
I didn't, you know.

1040
01:00:21.720 --> 01:00:22.914
I just did it.

1041
01:00:23.920 --> 01:00:25.433
<i>I took that guy out.</i>

1042
01:00:28.720 --> 01:00:30.711
<i>I didn't even get paid for it.</i>

1043
01:00:32.200 --> 01:00:33.200
<i>So I ended up</i>

1044
01:00:33.360 --> 01:00:35.749
with a bullet in the bicep
and 500 bucks of hospital bills.


1045
01:00:35.920 --> 01:00:37.478
It was stupid, really.

1046
01:00:39.600 --> 01:00:41.591
When I think about it,

1047
01:00:44.080 --> 01:00:46.071
it was the best day of my life.

1048
01:00:52.440 --> 01:00:54.749
Just for a moment I felt useful.

1049
01:00:55.640 --> 01:00:56.675
All right.

1050
01:01:12.880 --> 01:01:15.952
"Had Mademoiselle Blanche
been in England before?


1051
01:01:16.120 --> 01:01:18.714
"What part of France did she come from?

1052
01:01:18.880 --> 01:01:22.793
<i>"Mademoiselle Blanche
replied politely but with reserve."</i>


1053
01:01:25.120 --> 01:01:26.473
Hey.

1054
01:01:27.080 --> 01:01:28.229
Hey.

1055
01:01:30.520 --> 01:01:32.750
You've got your foot in the toilet.

1056
01:01:32.920 --> 01:01:34.239
I have?

1057
01:01:35.960 --> 01:01:38.679
Now you're getting the carpet all wet.

1058
01:01:40.200 --> 01:01:41.315
Was this your room?

1059
01:01:41.480 --> 01:01:43.471
No, it was Mom and Dad's.

1060
01:01:45.360 --> 01:01:47.078
Your dad tells me you're rebuilding.

1061
01:01:47.240 --> 01:01:49.913
Does it look rebuilt to you?

1062
01:01:50.080 --> 01:01:52.036
Not especially.

1063
01:01:52.200 --> 01:01:56.557
Dad barely ever comes here.
He feels guilty, I guess.


1064
01:01:56.720 --> 01:01:58.312
Because?

1065
01:01:58.520 --> 01:01:59.520
Hmm?

1066
01:02:00.080 --> 01:02:02.719
Oh, the fire.

1067
01:02:03.400 --> 01:02:05.755
Mom kept on complaining
about a leak in the furnace,


1068
01:02:05.920 --> 01:02:10.755
but Dad, you know,
he's got his nose thing,


1069
01:02:10.920 --> 01:02:14.230
so he couldn't smell the gas.

1070
01:02:15.520 --> 01:02:19.149
Anyways, I should probably
get back to my book.


1071
01:02:20.160 --> 01:02:21.559
All right.

1072
01:02:27.160 --> 01:02:28.229
Mr. Healy?

1073
01:02:31.520 --> 01:02:33.829
Are you a bad person?

1074
01:02:36.280 --> 01:02:38.589
What did you do to that man tonight?

1075
01:02:41.480 --> 01:02:43.277
Did you kill him?

1076
01:02:45.560 --> 01:02:47.118
Of course not.

1077
01:02:50.040 --> 01:02:51.519
That's good.

1078
01:02:52.240 --> 01:02:54.879
I knew you couldn't
do something like that.


1079
01:02:58.560 --> 01:03:00.994
Don't stay up too late, all right?

1080
01:03:31.120 --> 01:03:32.314
Shit.

1081
01:03:33.560 --> 01:03:34.976
I didn't know what time you'd get here.

1082
01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:36.319
You said afternoon.

1083
01:03:36.480 --> 01:03:40.393
Well, uh, we were at the bank
getting your money.


1084
01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:45.037
There it is, half,
minus a few 100, you know,


1085
01:03:45.200 --> 01:03:46.952
for, uh, that car that we crashed.

1086
01:03:47.120 --> 01:03:48.997
I thought you'd wanna chip in for that.

1087
01:03:49.160 --> 01:03:50.513
Sure.

1088
01:03:51.800 --> 01:03:52.835
What do you think?

1089
01:03:53.760 --> 01:03:55.990
- It's purple.
- It's maroon.


1090
01:03:57.160 --> 01:04:00.789
We stopped at a bar.
That's why we're late.


1091
01:04:02.600 --> 01:04:04.238
<i>So, Amelia's note.</i>

1092
01:04:04.400 --> 01:04:07.597
Burbank Airport. 
Western flight D.

1093
01:04:08.760 --> 01:04:10.239
I figure she's trying to skip town.

1094
01:04:10.440 --> 01:04:11.555
How do you wanna do this?

1095
01:04:12.920 --> 01:04:15.229
I don't know. I say we wait
a couple of days, call Kuttner


1096
01:04:15.400 --> 01:04:19.279
and see if we can squeeze
a second instalment out of her.


1097
01:04:19.440 --> 01:04:21.317
A second instalment?

1098
01:04:21.480 --> 01:04:23.277
<i>You don't wanna call too soon.</i>

1099
01:04:23.440 --> 01:04:27.149
Gotta act like you're onto something,
like you've been working hard.


1100
01:04:27.320 --> 01:04:31.711
Then, day three, ask for more money.

1101
01:04:32.520 --> 01:04:35.717
Well, she's putting a negative spin on it,
but, yeah, that's the idea.


1102
01:04:35.880 --> 01:04:37.711
Kuttner paid us. Me.

1103
01:04:37.880 --> 01:04:39.438
She paid me to do a job, right?

1104
01:04:39.640 --> 01:04:41.870
- I'm not gonna lie to her.
- I respect that.


1105
01:04:42.040 --> 01:04:43.792
That's why I'll lie to her.

1106
01:04:43.960 --> 01:04:47.873
Hey, I shelled out 400 bucks
for a detective.


1107
01:04:48.040 --> 01:04:50.235
Someone who finds clues, huh?

1108
01:04:50.440 --> 01:04:53.512
I found Sid Shattuck's corpse, didn't I?

1109
01:04:53.680 --> 01:04:54.680
Found it?

1110
01:04:55.480 --> 01:04:57.038
<i>You fell on it!</i>

1111
01:04:57.240 --> 01:05:00.755
I guess I don't understand
why we're not celebrating.


1112
01:05:00.920 --> 01:05:02.194
<i>I mean, we just got paid.</i>

1113
01:05:02.360 --> 01:05:04.191
We're all having a drink in the afternoon.

1114
01:05:08.240 --> 01:05:09.434
What?

1115
01:05:09.600 --> 01:05:11.591
Forget about it, all right?

1116
01:05:13.200 --> 01:05:14.400
<i>Oh, would you just...</i>

1117
01:05:14.440 --> 01:05:16.829
Would you hold on for a goddamn second?

1118
01:05:17.240 --> 01:05:19.356
You're the world's worst detective.

1119
01:05:21.080 --> 01:05:22.832
- I'm the worst?
- Yeah.


1120
01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:24.319
The world's worst?

1121
01:05:24.480 --> 01:05:26.038
Didn't you hear me the first time?

1122
01:05:26.200 --> 01:05:27.269
Got a cool ad, though.

1123
01:05:28.920 --> 01:05:30.876
So...

1124
01:05:31.400 --> 01:05:33.868
Why do you have to
be such a fuck-up, huh?

1125
01:05:34.040 --> 01:05:37.476
You go around and you drink
and you lie and stuff and people hate you!


1126
01:05:37.640 --> 01:05:39.517
Sweetheart, don't say, "and stuff."
Just say...


1127
01:05:39.680 --> 01:05:41.910
I hate you!

1128
01:05:42.200 --> 01:05:43.428
That works.

1129
01:05:45.400 --> 01:05:47.470
I'll find the girl myself.

1130
01:05:47.640 --> 01:05:48.856
You're gonna find her yourself. Okay.

1131
01:05:48.880 --> 01:05:50.096
<i>Well, say hi to her when you do.</i>

1132
01:05:50.120 --> 01:05:51.120
I will.

1133
01:05:51.280 --> 01:05:53.176
'Course, you're not gonna
find her at the airport,


1134
01:05:53.200 --> 01:05:54.633
seeing as how it's not a flight.

1135
01:05:59.040 --> 01:06:01.031
- Did he stop?
- Yeah.


1136
01:06:01.200 --> 01:06:04.397
Your note, look at it. 
It's not a flight.

1137
01:06:04.600 --> 01:06:08.036
<i>Every airport has
an overflight curfew from 10:00 to 6:00,</i>


1138
01:06:08.200 --> 01:06:09.200
<i>Burbank included.</i>

1139
01:06:09.360 --> 01:06:13.512
And that top number is today's date
but reversed like the European way,


1140
01:06:13.680 --> 01:06:17.036
which makes sense when you look at FLT
and you think it's not "flight,"


1141
01:06:17.200 --> 01:06:20.192
it's probably "flat," like apartment.

1142
01:06:22.040 --> 01:06:24.315
And Burbank APT West?

1143
01:06:24.480 --> 01:06:26.471
Burbank Apartments West.

1144
01:06:27.880 --> 01:06:30.519
It's a dump. Fuck it, 
I'll show you.

1145
01:06:30.800 --> 01:06:32.040
Holly, go to Janet's this time.

1146
01:06:32.160 --> 01:06:33.240
- But for real.
- Jessica's.


1147
01:06:33.320 --> 01:06:36.278
Jessica's. We've gotta go to work.

1148
01:06:36.440 --> 01:06:39.034
- Do you want your keys?
- I'm driving.


1149
01:06:56.440 --> 01:06:57.793
Excuse me.

1150
01:06:59.560 --> 01:07:01.516
We're looking for the Burbank Apartments.

1151
01:07:01.680 --> 01:07:03.477
Oh, they're gone.

1152
01:07:03.640 --> 01:07:06.996
Tore them babies down, um,
going on about two years now.


1153
01:07:14.440 --> 01:07:16.032
To the airport, then?

1154
01:07:18.200 --> 01:07:19.896
Well, they used to have
an overflight curfew.


1155
01:07:19.920 --> 01:07:21.336
It's all right. It's all right. It's okay.

1156
01:07:21.360 --> 01:07:22.360
- They did.
- Yeah.


1157
01:07:22.520 --> 01:07:24.056
And they still should
if they changed them.


1158
01:07:24.080 --> 01:07:26.674
They should, they should change them back.

1159
01:07:32.240 --> 01:07:33.240
- Pull over.
- What?


1160
01:07:33.400 --> 01:07:34.992
- Pull over.
- Hey, what the fuck?


1161
01:07:39.080 --> 01:07:41.196
<i>The Western Hotel.</i>

1162
01:07:41.400 --> 01:07:44.312
The Burbank Airport Western Hotel.

1163
01:07:44.480 --> 01:07:45.754
She's meeting somebody.

1164
01:07:47.120 --> 01:07:48.120
Okay.

1165
01:07:54.200 --> 01:07:56.430
Evening. What can I get you?

1166
01:07:56.600 --> 01:07:59.592
Information.
Have you seen this girl?


1167
01:07:59.760 --> 01:08:02.069
She probably came in
in the last half hour.


1168
01:08:02.240 --> 01:08:04.231
Hey, I just work here.

1169
01:08:04.400 --> 01:08:06.096
Yeah, no shit, Sherlock.
That's why I'm asking you.


1170
01:08:06.120 --> 01:08:09.510
Hmm. Memory gets a little foggy, you know.

1171
01:08:09.720 --> 01:08:11.631
What's in it for me?

1172
01:08:11.800 --> 01:08:12.800
He'll stop doing it.

1173
01:08:12.960 --> 01:08:13.995
Doing what?

1174
01:08:15.160 --> 01:08:16.160
Ow!

1175
01:08:16.320 --> 01:08:18.311
- That.
- Fuck!


1176
01:08:18.520 --> 01:08:21.478
Now, we can do this
the easy way, or we can...


1177
01:08:22.640 --> 01:08:24.471
We're currently doing it the easy way.

1178
01:08:24.640 --> 01:08:26.119
Okay. Jesus.

1179
01:08:27.160 --> 01:08:28.673
The penthouse.

1180
01:08:28.840 --> 01:08:31.434
She's in the penthouse, top floor.

1181
01:08:31.600 --> 01:08:32.880
- Are you happy?
- Yeah.


1182
01:08:33.040 --> 01:08:34.109
Guys, listen.

1183
01:08:34.280 --> 01:08:37.431
You don't go up there,
all right? Trust me.


1184
01:08:37.600 --> 01:08:39.636
These New York guys are up there.

1185
01:08:39.800 --> 01:08:40.994
Uh, business guys.

1186
01:08:41.160 --> 01:08:43.116
<i>They got fucking bodyguards.</i>

1187
01:08:43.280 --> 01:08:44.633
Kind of had their balls removed.

1188
01:08:44.840 --> 01:08:45.875
What's that called? Huh?

1189
01:08:46.040 --> 01:08:47.359
Marriage?

1190
01:08:48.160 --> 01:08:50.515
Yeah. Uh...

1191
01:08:50.800 --> 01:08:54.156
Just chill here, you know.
She's gotta come back down.


1192
01:08:54.320 --> 01:08:56.117
Have a couple of cold ones on me?

1193
01:08:56.280 --> 01:08:57.315
Oh, not for me.

1194
01:08:57.520 --> 01:08:58.976
He makes
a strong argument, though.


1195
01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:00.797
You see? Reasonable. 
Very reasonable.

1196
01:09:00.960 --> 01:09:02.154
Now, your buddy,

1197
01:09:02.360 --> 01:09:04.112
that was the problem,
he wasn't reasonable.


1198
01:09:04.320 --> 01:09:05.435
Our buddy?

1199
01:09:05.600 --> 01:09:06.936
<i>Yeah, we don't have friends.</i>

1200
01:09:06.960 --> 01:09:09.155
The other guy looking for Amelia,
he wasn't with you?


1201
01:09:09.800 --> 01:09:10.800
Where'd he go?

1202
01:09:10.960 --> 01:09:12.696
Got in the elevator
right before you guys came in.


1203
01:09:12.720 --> 01:09:14.358
Did you get a name?

1204
01:09:14.520 --> 01:09:16.078
John something.

1205
01:09:16.240 --> 01:09:17.976
Did you actually witness him
getting into the elevator?


1206
01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:20.230
No, it was told to me
by a wise old Indian.


1207
01:09:20.400 --> 01:09:22.550
<i>Of course I fucking witnessed it.</i>

1208
01:09:22.720 --> 01:09:24.392
- Right.
- What the hell's going on?


1209
01:09:24.560 --> 01:09:25.595
Oh, it just makes sense.

1210
01:09:25.800 --> 01:09:27.358
- It connects up.
- What makes sense?


1211
01:09:27.520 --> 01:09:30.432
John Boy. Oh, just something
that Blueface mentioned, yeah.


1212
01:09:30.680 --> 01:09:31.920
What do you mean, he mentioned?

1213
01:09:32.080 --> 01:09:33.229
Mentioned how?

1214
01:09:33.400 --> 01:09:34.628
Oh, you know, he...

1215
01:09:34.800 --> 01:09:36.279
"There's a guy coming to kill you."

1216
01:09:36.440 --> 01:09:38.795
That kind of crap. Yeah.

1217
01:09:38.960 --> 01:09:41.520
We should probably just stay here.

1218
01:09:41.680 --> 01:09:42.874
Smart move.

1219
01:09:45.080 --> 01:09:47.913
Unless, of course, he's up there
killing her right now.


1220
01:09:48.080 --> 01:09:50.548
Nobody's getting killed
at the Burbank Airport Hotel.


1221
01:09:50.720 --> 01:09:52.278
Because?

1222
01:09:52.440 --> 01:09:54.590
- That would be national news.
- Yeah, so?


1223
01:09:54.760 --> 01:09:56.776
Oh, so when's the last time
you were on national news?


1224
01:09:56.800 --> 01:09:58.153
- February.
- Really?


1225
01:09:58.320 --> 01:09:59.958
- Yeah.
- For what?


1226
01:10:00.120 --> 01:10:02.793
- I got shot, in a diner.
- Where?


1227
01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:05.560
In my arm. I
told you this last night.

1228
01:10:06.600 --> 01:10:07.749
We should call the cops.

1229
01:10:07.920 --> 01:10:08.989
No. It'll take too long.

1230
01:10:09.160 --> 01:10:10.229
I mean, she could die.

1231
01:10:10.400 --> 01:10:12.755
You just said
it was the right move to stay down here.


1232
01:10:12.920 --> 01:10:15.309
No, I said smart move. Different.

1233
01:10:31.360 --> 01:10:32.679
Munich.

1234
01:10:34.240 --> 01:10:35.719
What?

1235
01:10:35.880 --> 01:10:37.871
A guy without his balls.

1236
01:10:39.120 --> 01:10:41.111
It's a Munich.

1237
01:10:42.480 --> 01:10:45.358
Munich is a city in Germany.

1238
01:10:45.520 --> 01:10:48.751
M√ľnchen. Munich. Yeah.

1239
01:10:48.920 --> 01:10:50.194
Right.

1240
01:10:51.840 --> 01:10:53.831
Hitler only had one ball.

1241
01:10:55.960 --> 01:10:58.000
All right, here we go.

1242
01:11:13.640 --> 01:11:14.789
<i>Hey! Whoa!</i>

1243
01:11:40.120 --> 01:11:41.120
Oh, shit.

1244
01:11:50.520 --> 01:11:51.635
What are we doing?

1245
01:11:51.800 --> 01:11:52.949
I can't just leave.

1246
01:11:53.120 --> 01:11:54.348
Why?

1247
01:11:54.520 --> 01:11:56.192
She's in danger, man.

1248
01:11:56.360 --> 01:11:58.396
- We have to do something about it.
- She's dead.


1249
01:11:58.560 --> 01:12:00.200
- What do you mean, she's dead?
- Come on!


1250
01:12:00.360 --> 01:12:01.536
- She's not dead.
- Open your eyes, man.


1251
01:12:01.560 --> 01:12:02.560
You don't know that!

1252
01:12:02.720 --> 01:12:04.560
- She's fucking dead!
- You don't know she's...


1253
01:12:32.920 --> 01:12:34.114
What are you doing here?

1254
01:12:34.320 --> 01:12:35.719
Holy shit, you got her.

1255
01:12:35.880 --> 01:12:37.280
You're supposed to be at Jessica's.

1256
01:12:37.400 --> 01:12:38.680
<i>Yeah, sorry, Mr. March.</i>

1257
01:12:38.720 --> 01:12:41.075
My sister kicked us out.
She's having a guy over.


1258
01:12:41.240 --> 01:12:42.280
Your sister's such a slut.

1259
01:12:42.400 --> 01:12:44.038
Yeah, I know.

1260
01:12:47.400 --> 01:12:48.549
Hello?

1261
01:12:49.240 --> 01:12:50.673
<i>Amelia.</i>

1262
01:12:50.880 --> 01:12:53.075
Should you shake her shoulder? Maybe...

1263
01:12:53.240 --> 01:12:55.071
You know, my brother
used to flick my ear.

1264
01:12:55.240 --> 01:12:56.389
Like that. I hated that.

1265
01:12:56.560 --> 01:12:57.816
- We shouldn't be violent.
- You got a brother?


1266
01:12:57.840 --> 01:12:58.976
- You could just hit her.
- Yeah.


1267
01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:00.120
- Really?
- Like really hard.


1268
01:13:00.160 --> 01:13:01.496
- I've got a family.
- It's not practical.


1269
01:13:01.520 --> 01:13:04.512
<i>We probably shouldn't hit her
if we want her to talk to us.</i>


1270
01:13:04.680 --> 01:13:06.272
It's okay.

1271
01:13:06.480 --> 01:13:08.216
You were supposed
to get those guys off of me.


1272
01:13:08.240 --> 01:13:09.936
Do you know who they were?
Do you know who sent them?


1273
01:13:09.960 --> 01:13:12.758
Yeah. It was my mother.

1274
01:13:18.960 --> 01:13:21.793
Would you mind starting
from the top because...


1275
01:13:21.960 --> 01:13:25.032
- Why? It doesn't matter.
- I'm sorry, it doesn't matter?


1276
01:13:25.200 --> 01:13:27.156
You just shot at us. 
I think it matters.

1277
01:13:27.320 --> 01:13:29.151
Okay, okay. I made a film.

1278
01:13:29.320 --> 01:13:31.675
I made a film with Dean, my boyfriend.

1279
01:13:31.880 --> 01:13:33.680
And the idea was
that we were gonna, you know,


1280
01:13:33.760 --> 01:13:39.357
like make this experimental film,
like an artistic film.


1281
01:13:39.520 --> 01:13:41.795
- Porno film.
- It's not a porno.


1282
01:13:45.160 --> 01:13:47.071
Look, do you even
know who my mother is?

1283
01:13:47.240 --> 01:13:48.878
Yes, we do.

1284
01:13:49.040 --> 01:13:51.156
We've actually met your mother.

1285
01:13:51.320 --> 01:13:53.056
What did she tell you,
that I'm crazy?


1286
01:13:53.080 --> 01:13:55.355
That I was just lashing out?

1287
01:13:55.520 --> 01:13:56.816
Something like that.
She might have mentioned...


1288
01:13:56.840 --> 01:14:00.276
Yeah, well, my mother is a criminal.

1289
01:14:00.440 --> 01:14:01.668
She's one of them.

1290
01:14:01.840 --> 01:14:03.159
Who's them? What's them?

1291
01:14:03.320 --> 01:14:04.753
<i>One of the insiders.</i>

1292
01:14:04.920 --> 01:14:08.390
One of the capitalist,
corporate suppressors.


1293
01:14:08.560 --> 01:14:09.856
You know, they want us dead, man!

1294
01:14:09.880 --> 01:14:11.496
We're just in their crosshairs, you know!

1295
01:14:11.520 --> 01:14:12.589
We're just pawns!

1296
01:14:12.760 --> 01:14:13.760
Gosh.

1297
01:14:14.160 --> 01:14:15.160
Ow.

1298
01:14:15.560 --> 01:14:17.232
Hey.

1299
01:14:19.200 --> 01:14:21.031
And what does this
have to do with the birds?


1300
01:14:21.200 --> 01:14:22.394
<i>Yeah.</i>

1301
01:14:22.960 --> 01:14:25.560
My mom's supposed to be working
for the Justice Department, right?


1302
01:14:25.680 --> 01:14:27.910
Sure, she's prosecuting
the catalytic converter case.


1303
01:14:28.080 --> 01:14:30.799
Yeah, only she's not.
She's not prosecuting it.


1304
01:14:30.960 --> 01:14:32.951
The auto makers, she's gonna let 'em walk.

1305
01:14:33.120 --> 01:14:35.320
- But they have the evidence.
- Yes, they have evidence.


1306
01:14:35.440 --> 01:14:36.793
They have memos proving that

1307
01:14:36.960 --> 01:14:39.269
Detroit conspired
to suppress the converter,


1308
01:14:39.440 --> 01:14:40.440
proving they would rather

1309
01:14:40.600 --> 01:14:42.416
poison our air than spend
a little bit of money.


1310
01:14:42.440 --> 01:14:44.096
But my mom, she's gonna say
that's not enough.


1311
01:14:44.120 --> 01:14:46.634
She's gonna lie because...
Because she's on the take.


1312
01:14:46.800 --> 01:14:49.268
Money again, right?
Mammon, that's her god.


1313
01:14:49.440 --> 01:14:51.510
That fascist crony...

1314
01:14:51.680 --> 01:14:52.680
- Okay, okay.
- ...bogart!


1315
01:14:52.920 --> 01:14:55.559
All right, all right,
just back up a little bit.


1316
01:14:57.120 --> 01:14:58.456
Why not just go straight to the police?

1317
01:14:58.480 --> 01:15:00.118
She is the police.

1318
01:15:00.280 --> 01:15:02.430
She's the head of the Justice Department.

1319
01:15:02.600 --> 01:15:03.794
You've got a point.

1320
01:15:03.960 --> 01:15:04.960
Okay, or the newspaper?

1321
01:15:05.120 --> 01:15:06.519
They all work together.

1322
01:15:06.720 --> 01:15:08.756
God, have you been living under a rock?

1323
01:15:08.920 --> 01:15:13.869
All right, so then your solution
was you make a porn film.


1324
01:15:14.040 --> 01:15:15.189
It's not a porno!

1325
01:15:15.400 --> 01:15:16.840
<i>You know, I have neighbors.</i>

1326
01:15:16.920 --> 01:15:18.440
- I made a statement.
<i>- Right.</i>


1327
01:15:18.480 --> 01:15:21.836
And yeah, yeah,
my statement contained nudity.


1328
01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:23.160
- Porno nudity.
<i>- Art.</i>


1329
01:15:23.240 --> 01:15:25.595
That's just the commercial element, okay?

1330
01:15:25.760 --> 01:15:27.830
Okay? Sid said we had to have that.

1331
01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:30.468
And the reality was
we were getting our message out there.


1332
01:15:30.640 --> 01:15:32.631
And it was all in the film,

1333
01:15:32.800 --> 01:15:36.190
names and dates and everything,
everything that my mom was doing,


1334
01:15:36.360 --> 01:15:38.360
and once it was out there,
once it was in theaters,


1335
01:15:38.480 --> 01:15:39.616
there's no way that
they could suppress it.


1336
01:15:39.640 --> 01:15:42.473
There's no way
that they could cover it up.


1337
01:15:42.640 --> 01:15:44.120
So let me get this straight.

1338
01:15:44.280 --> 01:15:47.033
You made a porno film
where the point was the plot?


1339
01:15:47.200 --> 01:15:48.713
What's your hang-up, man?

1340
01:15:48.880 --> 01:15:50.233
It's not the sex.

1341
01:15:50.400 --> 01:15:52.595
It's what's in the story.

1342
01:15:52.760 --> 01:15:54.751
My mom found out.

1343
01:15:57.760 --> 01:16:00.115
She killed Dean and destroyed the film.

1344
01:16:00.320 --> 01:16:01.878
Your mom killed Dean?

1345
01:16:02.040 --> 01:16:03.393
Of course.

1346
01:16:04.440 --> 01:16:05.793
She killed Misty, too.

1347
01:16:05.960 --> 01:16:07.678
And Sid Shattuck?

1348
01:16:09.160 --> 01:16:10.309
Yeah.

1349
01:16:10.480 --> 01:16:11.840
Okay, so it's like Jack the Ripper

1350
01:16:11.880 --> 01:16:14.952
and then your mom, basically.

1351
01:16:15.400 --> 01:16:16.594
So what are you gonna do?

1352
01:16:16.760 --> 01:16:17.988
I don't know.

1353
01:16:19.600 --> 01:16:21.955
I'm just really tired, you know.

1354
01:16:23.120 --> 01:16:25.873
Uh, all right, okay. 
So, uh, you...

1355
01:16:26.040 --> 01:16:29.350
We're just gonna talk about it and
we'll think and you get some rest.


1356
01:16:29.520 --> 01:16:31.238
Yeah, just get some rest.

1357
01:16:36.960 --> 01:16:38.518
What do you think?

1358
01:16:38.680 --> 01:16:39.954
I like her.

1359
01:16:40.120 --> 01:16:41.120
I like her dress.

1360
01:16:41.320 --> 01:16:42.514
It's a nice dress.

1361
01:16:42.680 --> 01:16:44.318
But she's a loon.

1362
01:16:44.960 --> 01:16:46.791
According to her,
her mother's single-handedly


1363
01:16:46.960 --> 01:16:49.269
gonna wipe out all of Western society.

1364
01:16:49.440 --> 01:16:51.317
Well, yeah.

1365
01:16:51.480 --> 01:16:55.553
However, there are people
trying to kill her, right?


1366
01:16:55.720 --> 01:16:57.915
- Like John Boy.
- Who's John Boy?


1367
01:16:58.080 --> 01:16:59.798
He's on <i>The Waltons.</i>

1368
01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:01.319
No, different John Boy.

1369
01:17:01.480 --> 01:17:02.629
Well, we think.

1370
01:17:02.840 --> 01:17:04.637
Think, yeah. Pretty sure.

1371
01:17:04.840 --> 01:17:07.400
Can't be sure, though. Yeah.

1372
01:17:07.920 --> 01:17:11.469
Mr. March, I just
got a call from Judith.

1373
01:17:11.680 --> 01:17:13.477
She didn't explain herself.

1374
01:17:13.680 --> 01:17:16.797
Said she needed $100,000 in cash.

1375
01:17:16.960 --> 01:17:18.837
- $100,000? Why?
<i>- I don't know.</i>


1376
01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:22.470
I think she's involved
in something shady maybe.


1377
01:17:22.640 --> 01:17:24.756
Well, her daughter
certainly seems to think so.


1378
01:17:24.920 --> 01:17:26.911
What, Amelia? You found Amelia?

1379
01:17:27.080 --> 01:17:28.080
<i>Yes.</i>

1380
01:17:28.280 --> 01:17:29.918
She fell on our car.

1381
01:17:30.080 --> 01:17:31.957
We were just talking
and she fell on our car.


1382
01:17:32.160 --> 01:17:33.800
Anyway, she's here. 
You should come over.

1383
01:17:33.960 --> 01:17:36.349
I'll send the family doctor.

1384
01:17:37.960 --> 01:17:39.029
Okay, look,

1385
01:17:39.200 --> 01:17:41.316
<i>- Mr. March...</i>
- Holland, please.


1386
01:17:41.480 --> 01:17:43.755
<i>I've got a bad feeling about this.</i>

1387
01:17:43.960 --> 01:17:48.715
Would you be willing
to carry the money for me?


1388
01:17:56.200 --> 01:17:59.351
I wish I knew who
to believe on this one.

1389
01:17:59.560 --> 01:18:01.710
Well, the kid's a write-off,
I'll tell you that much.


1390
01:18:04.040 --> 01:18:05.678
Maybe they're both telling the truth.

1391
01:18:05.840 --> 01:18:07.717
We're downstairs.

1392
01:18:08.720 --> 01:18:10.119
She's coming down.

1393
01:18:12.400 --> 01:18:13.976
What do you mean,
they're both telling the truth?


1394
01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:15.228
What the fuck does that mean?

1395
01:18:15.400 --> 01:18:17.630
I got a friend, right?

1396
01:18:17.800 --> 01:18:19.870
Secret Service. 
Worked the Nixon detail.

1397
01:18:20.080 --> 01:18:22.640
This was after
they threw him out of office.


1398
01:18:23.720 --> 01:18:24.720
No. Anyway, you know,

1399
01:18:24.920 --> 01:18:26.896
Nixon's driving around
one day around San Clemente.


1400
01:18:26.920 --> 01:18:28.114
Just him and a few agents.

1401
01:18:28.280 --> 01:18:29.280
Yeah.

1402
01:18:29.440 --> 01:18:31.670
And they come across
this car accident, right?


1403
01:18:31.840 --> 01:18:33.990
There's a guy pinned under a car.

1404
01:18:34.160 --> 01:18:38.312
Anyway, Nixon gets out,
runs over to check on the guy,


1405
01:18:38.520 --> 01:18:40.317
you know, leans down,
and Nixon says to him,


1406
01:18:40.520 --> 01:18:43.751
"You're gonna be okay, son.
You're gonna be all right."


1407
01:18:43.920 --> 01:18:46.593
And right then the guy dies.

1408
01:18:49.400 --> 01:18:50.628
I don't get it.

1409
01:18:50.800 --> 01:18:53.030
Think about it
from that guy's point of view, okay?


1410
01:18:53.240 --> 01:18:54.355
The guy who died.

1411
01:18:54.520 --> 01:18:57.432
He's lying there on the ground,
staring up at the sky, near death,


1412
01:18:57.600 --> 01:18:59.816
and then former president,
Richard Nixon, appears before him


1413
01:18:59.840 --> 01:19:01.160
and tells him he's gonna be fine.

1414
01:19:01.200 --> 01:19:03.953
Now, did he think that's normal, right,

1415
01:19:04.120 --> 01:19:06.953
that before they die everybody sees Nixon?

1416
01:19:07.120 --> 01:19:08.872
You're expecting an angel
and you get Nixon.


1417
01:19:09.040 --> 01:19:10.519
- Exactly. Right?
- Yeah.


1418
01:19:10.680 --> 01:19:13.433
It's the same situation,
just a vastly different point of view.


1419
01:19:13.600 --> 01:19:15.795
- So there's two ways to look at something.
- Yeah.


1420
01:19:15.960 --> 01:19:17.416
- That's the point of the story?
- Yeah.


1421
01:19:17.440 --> 01:19:19.158
- Yeah, just say that.
- What?


1422
01:19:19.320 --> 01:19:21.776
Well, you just lead me on this
epic fucking journey with this story


1423
01:19:21.800 --> 01:19:23.016
and 10 minutes later the point is

1424
01:19:23.040 --> 01:19:24.616
that there's two ways
to look at something.


1425
01:19:24.640 --> 01:19:26.471
Just... You could just say that.

1426
01:19:26.640 --> 01:19:27.868
You didn't like that story?

1427
01:19:30.280 --> 01:19:32.000
- That would be awful.
- Wouldn't it, right?


1428
01:19:32.040 --> 01:19:33.792
- Yeah.
- It would suck, right?


1429
01:19:33.960 --> 01:19:35.154
- Oh.
<i>- Hey.</i>


1430
01:19:35.320 --> 01:19:36.548
Thank God.

1431
01:19:36.720 --> 01:19:39.632
$100,000. Packed it myself.

1432
01:19:39.800 --> 01:19:41.028
Just...

1433
01:19:41.720 --> 01:19:45.793
It's not common you find
such nice people in the world.


1434
01:19:49.160 --> 01:19:50.160
I'm sorry about him.

1435
01:19:50.320 --> 01:19:52.276
He just wanted to come along.
I don't know why.


1436
01:19:52.440 --> 01:19:55.830
But I'll call you, you know,
when we make the drop.


1437
01:19:57.760 --> 01:19:58.988
Thank you.

1438
01:20:02.680 --> 01:20:04.079
Are you nervous at all?

1439
01:20:04.240 --> 01:20:05.514
Me? No.

1440
01:20:06.320 --> 01:20:07.514
I got insurance.

1441
01:20:07.680 --> 01:20:09.432
This baby right here.

1442
01:20:09.600 --> 01:20:11.079
<i>Is that an ankle gun?</i>

1443
01:20:11.280 --> 01:20:12.793
That is an ankle gun, yeah.

1444
01:20:12.960 --> 01:20:15.349
- That's pretty sweet.
- Uh-huh.


1445
01:20:16.480 --> 01:20:18.357
I'm falling asleep at the wheel here, man.

1446
01:20:18.520 --> 01:20:19.839
I'm gonna need you to drive.

1447
01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:22.150
<i>I'm gonna pull over up here.</i>

1448
01:20:23.080 --> 01:20:25.958
You don't have to pull over.
The car can drive itself.


1449
01:20:26.720 --> 01:20:28.119
What?

1450
01:20:28.400 --> 01:20:30.868
Just take your hands off the wheel, man.

1451
01:20:41.920 --> 01:20:42.920
Hmm.

1452
01:20:46.200 --> 01:20:48.475
I didn't know it could do that.

1453
01:20:48.920 --> 01:20:50.717
Where you been, man?

1454
01:20:52.720 --> 01:20:54.756
Every car can do this.

1455
01:20:54.920 --> 01:20:57.229
Yeah, March, where the fuck
have you been, man?


1456
01:20:57.400 --> 01:20:58.753
Idiot. You didn't know that?

1457
01:21:00.280 --> 01:21:02.157
You fly everywhere. 
You don't even drive.

1458
01:21:02.320 --> 01:21:03.355
What do you know?

1459
01:21:03.520 --> 01:21:05.112
He's got a point there, Bumble.

1460
01:21:05.280 --> 01:21:06.872
Yeah, whatever.

1461
01:21:07.080 --> 01:21:10.072
I used to fly all the time,
but now the smog is just disgusting, man.


1462
01:21:10.240 --> 01:21:11.920
It's just this pollution
is out of control.


1463
01:21:12.080 --> 01:21:14.071
All the bees are riding around
in cars these days.


1464
01:21:14.240 --> 01:21:15.593
Wake up! Wake up!

1465
01:21:15.800 --> 01:21:17.313
March! Wake up!

1466
01:21:17.480 --> 01:21:19.232
March! Wake up!

1467
01:21:37.600 --> 01:21:39.238
That's not money.

1468
01:21:41.600 --> 01:21:43.636
Tally packed it herself. She said so.

1469
01:21:44.440 --> 01:21:47.750
Why? Why would she send us off
on some wild fucking goose chase?


1470
01:21:49.960 --> 01:21:51.279
Amelia.

1471
01:21:58.600 --> 01:22:01.034
- No, like <i>The Waltons.</i>
<i>- Yeah?</i>


1472
01:22:01.200 --> 01:22:02.315
Yeah, on TV.

1473
01:22:03.120 --> 01:22:04.712
Richard something? Yeah.

1474
01:22:04.880 --> 01:22:06.233
Who's that actor?

1475
01:22:06.400 --> 01:22:07.913
Jessica, get off the phone.

1476
01:22:08.080 --> 01:22:12.392
Yeah. Anyway, so this new John Boy's
like a murderer or something.


1477
01:22:12.560 --> 01:22:13.754
Uh-huh.

1478
01:22:14.080 --> 01:22:16.355
Shit. Now it's gonna bug me.

1479
01:22:18.040 --> 01:22:19.632
You must be Holly.

1480
01:22:20.840 --> 01:22:22.068
Dr. Malek.

1481
01:22:22.280 --> 01:22:23.280
- Hi.
- Hi.


1482
01:22:23.440 --> 01:22:25.237
She's inside. Come in.

1483
01:22:25.400 --> 01:22:26.719
Thank you.

1484
01:22:27.520 --> 01:22:29.476
<i>Yeah, I don't know...</i>

1485
01:22:34.400 --> 01:22:35.753
You mind fetching your dad?

1486
01:22:35.960 --> 01:22:37.313
Uh, he's running an errand.

1487
01:22:38.640 --> 01:22:40.153
Back anytime soon?

1488
01:22:40.320 --> 01:22:41.833
Oh, hour, tops.

1489
01:22:42.040 --> 01:22:43.314
Fine.

1490
01:22:44.320 --> 01:22:48.154
Now, then, Nurse Holly, how's our patient?

1491
01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:50.319
That's her?

1492
01:22:50.520 --> 01:22:52.158
Oh, no, that's Jessica.

1493
01:22:52.320 --> 01:22:54.311
What she's got you can't fix.

1494
01:22:54.920 --> 01:22:56.717
You are very funny.

1495
01:22:56.880 --> 01:22:57.949
In there.

1496
01:22:58.120 --> 01:23:00.839
<i>- Asleep. Slight fever.</i>
- Hmm.


1497
01:23:01.360 --> 01:23:03.191
On drugs you think?

1498
01:23:03.360 --> 01:23:05.112
Maybe smoking the reefer?

1499
01:23:09.160 --> 01:23:11.037
What was she saying?

1500
01:23:12.520 --> 01:23:14.033
Was she making sense?

1501
01:23:14.200 --> 01:23:15.349
<i>Hold on. Um...</i>

1502
01:23:15.520 --> 01:23:18.512
Holly, what's the name of the guy
on <i>The Walton</i> s that plays John Boy?


1503
01:23:18.680 --> 01:23:21.114
<i>With the hockey puck on his face?</i>

1504
01:23:23.360 --> 01:23:25.828
That show's for retards.

1505
01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:29.117
Dr. Malek, would you like a cookie?
Just baked them.


1506
01:23:29.280 --> 01:23:31.316
There's none left. 
I looked, remember?

1507
01:23:31.520 --> 01:23:34.273
No, there's a couple. Doctor?

1508
01:23:37.160 --> 01:23:39.071
I could be persuaded.

1509
01:23:42.120 --> 01:23:44.839
After I have a look at Sleeping Beauty.

1510
01:23:46.760 --> 01:23:48.273
Nurse Holly.

1511
01:23:51.240 --> 01:23:53.435
Holly, what are you doing? 
Are you crazy?

1512
01:23:53.600 --> 01:23:55.795
There are handcuffs
behind the bar, asshole.


1513
01:23:56.000 --> 01:23:57.194
Get them.

1514
01:23:59.880 --> 01:24:02.599
This is really slowing me down, Holly.

1515
01:24:02.800 --> 01:24:04.153
What's going on?

1516
01:24:04.320 --> 01:24:06.276
Jessica, it's him. He's the guy.

1517
01:24:06.440 --> 01:24:09.876
Jessica, if you help me with this,

1518
01:24:12.760 --> 01:24:14.159
I'll only kill Holly.

1519
01:24:20.520 --> 01:24:21.794
Jessica, dial 911.

1520
01:24:21.960 --> 01:24:25.396
Jessica, I wouldn't do
that if I were you.

1521
01:24:36.560 --> 01:24:38.312
You hear that?

1522
01:24:46.120 --> 01:24:48.350
- Excuse me.
- Evening.


1523
01:24:49.600 --> 01:24:51.955
<i>You hear that sound
just a second ago?</i>


1524
01:24:52.120 --> 01:24:53.951
Oh, yeah, just now.

1525
01:24:54.120 --> 01:24:55.473
<i>That was me.</i>

1526
01:24:55.640 --> 01:24:57.949
I threw that little girl out the window.

1527
01:25:00.920 --> 01:25:01.920
Cover me.

1528
01:25:18.160 --> 01:25:19.593
- Holly!
- Dad!


1529
01:25:19.760 --> 01:25:21.096
- Get in.
- Is she okay?


1530
01:25:21.120 --> 01:25:22.235
Get down.

1531
01:25:25.360 --> 01:25:26.918
Fucking fascists!

1532
01:25:27.080 --> 01:25:28.115
Jesus!

1533
01:25:28.280 --> 01:25:29.474
Sorry.

1534
01:25:29.680 --> 01:25:30.680
Get in.

1535
01:25:32.240 --> 01:25:35.596
Okay, come here.
Stay in here and don't move.


1536
01:25:35.760 --> 01:25:36.988
- Okay.
- Okay. Okay.


1537
01:25:37.160 --> 01:25:38.639
Wait, wait. Dad, 
Dad, here you go.

1538
01:25:38.800 --> 01:25:39.800
Jesus!

1539
01:25:49.640 --> 01:25:51.835
Jessica. I think she's awake.

1540
01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:54.116
Wait, where are you going?
What are you doing?


1541
01:25:54.280 --> 01:25:55.872
Tell Mr. Healy thanks for nothing.

1542
01:26:12.160 --> 01:26:13.195
Oh, fuck.

1543
01:26:22.200 --> 01:26:23.633
Fuck!

1544
01:26:26.640 --> 01:26:27.640
Are you okay?

1545
01:26:27.800 --> 01:26:28.800
March, gun, gun!

1546
01:26:31.240 --> 01:26:32.719
- Fuck!
- Shit!


1547
01:26:40.520 --> 01:26:41.555
Here.

1548
01:27:03.720 --> 01:27:05.073
He's gone.

1549
01:27:05.920 --> 01:27:07.069
He's gone.

1550
01:27:07.760 --> 01:27:08.760
Hey.

1551
01:27:19.040 --> 01:27:20.598
Shit.

1552
01:27:28.960 --> 01:27:29.960
Wow.

1553
01:27:31.960 --> 01:27:33.320
Please, I need to get out of here.

1554
01:28:25.200 --> 01:28:26.880
She had her fucking
daughter killed, Perry.


1555
01:28:26.960 --> 01:28:28.960
Please tell me they're
at least gonna question her.


1556
01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:30.520
They haven't and they're not going to.

1557
01:28:30.600 --> 01:28:31.600
Because?

1558
01:28:31.760 --> 01:28:33.256
Because she's the head
of the Justice Department.


1559
01:28:33.280 --> 01:28:35.040
Oh, and, by the way, you're welcome.

1560
01:28:35.120 --> 01:28:37.918
You're out, free on your own recognizance.
You get to walk.


1561
01:28:38.120 --> 01:28:40.401
There should be like a statue
of me in your fucking house.


1562
01:28:42.440 --> 01:28:43.509
I'm sorry, guys.

1563
01:28:43.680 --> 01:28:45.200
You're gonna lose this one, all right?

1564
01:28:45.360 --> 01:28:48.272
Your word against hers.
No evidence. You lose.


1565
01:28:49.120 --> 01:28:52.476
You better seriously think
about changing your story.


1566
01:29:18.560 --> 01:29:21.393
<i>Oh, fuck it. 
Maybe they're right.</i>

1567
01:29:22.760 --> 01:29:25.399
Maybe the goddamn birds can't breathe.

1568
01:29:28.040 --> 01:29:32.670
Amelia, Misty, Dean, 
Shattuck, all dead.

1569
01:29:33.560 --> 01:29:35.869
The rest of us just get to choke.

1570
01:29:37.320 --> 01:29:39.550
I need a drink.

1571
01:29:47.760 --> 01:29:49.640
- How much do I owe you, buddy?
- 12 bucks, pal.


1572
01:29:49.720 --> 01:29:51.631
I always hated that palm tree.

1573
01:29:54.640 --> 01:29:57.234
Never trusted it.

1574
01:29:59.520 --> 01:30:01.795
- Go inside and get your stuff.
- Okay.


1575
01:30:01.960 --> 01:30:03.871
We'll go stay in a hotel or something.

1576
01:30:04.800 --> 01:30:06.711
We'll get room service.

1577
01:30:14.920 --> 01:30:16.114
Mr. March.

1578
01:30:16.280 --> 01:30:17.599
Mrs. Glenn.

1579
01:30:17.800 --> 01:30:20.030
I need to talk to you.

1580
01:30:20.200 --> 01:30:21.952
What a wonderful surprise.

1581
01:30:23.440 --> 01:30:25.954
- Is that your house?
- We're remodeling.


1582
01:30:26.800 --> 01:30:28.119
Listen, this isn't a great time.

1583
01:30:28.280 --> 01:30:29.998
It is a great time.

1584
01:30:30.160 --> 01:30:33.914
He is supposed to
be looking for my niece.

1585
01:30:34.080 --> 01:30:36.230
- Really?
- Because I saw her.


1586
01:30:36.440 --> 01:30:39.034
But nobody believes me.

1587
01:30:39.240 --> 01:30:41.231
Why will nobody believe me?

1588
01:30:41.400 --> 01:30:42.628
I'm sure I don't know, ma'am.

1589
01:30:42.800 --> 01:30:47.237
I saw her in her house
through the front window as clear as day,


1590
01:30:47.400 --> 01:30:49.356
writing something at a desk.

1591
01:30:49.520 --> 01:30:52.398
She was wearing a blue pinstriped jacket.

1592
01:30:52.560 --> 01:30:55.028
I've seen that jacket, sure, yeah.

1593
01:30:56.120 --> 01:30:57.496
What do you mean, you saw that jacket?

1594
01:30:57.520 --> 01:30:58.520
In Shattuck's office.

1595
01:30:58.680 --> 01:31:00.360
It was there with
a bunch of other clothes.


1596
01:31:01.440 --> 01:31:03.158
That jacket was in Sid Shattuck's office?

1597
01:31:03.320 --> 01:31:04.320
Yeah. It was bagged up.

1598
01:31:04.480 --> 01:31:06.496
It had Misty's name on it
and the name of the movie.


1599
01:31:06.520 --> 01:31:08.590
It's wardrobe for the film.

1600
01:31:09.320 --> 01:31:10.639
It's wardrobe for the film.

1601
01:31:12.560 --> 01:31:14.596
- Holy fucking shit.
- Oh!


1602
01:31:14.840 --> 01:31:17.912
Sorry. Mrs. Glenn, I need you
to take us to Misty's house.


1603
01:31:18.080 --> 01:31:19.798
I need you to show us
exactly what you saw.


1604
01:31:24.920 --> 01:31:27.514
<i>There. There.
That's the window.</i>


1605
01:31:28.520 --> 01:31:32.638
I was coming around that corner
and I saw her through that window.


1606
01:31:36.240 --> 01:31:39.038
But, no, it was here. 
The desk was here.

1607
01:31:39.200 --> 01:31:40.200
No desk there now.

1608
01:31:40.360 --> 01:31:42.191
<i>Well,
I don't know what to say.</i>


1609
01:31:42.360 --> 01:31:43.475
Dad, what are you doing?

1610
01:31:43.680 --> 01:31:45.113
Give me a second.

1611
01:31:51.840 --> 01:31:53.751
World's worst detective, huh?

1612
01:31:53.920 --> 01:31:55.433
You did see your niece, Mrs. Glenn.

1613
01:31:55.600 --> 01:31:59.195
You saw her on that wall,
at a desk, in a pinstriped suit.


1614
01:31:59.400 --> 01:32:02.631
So what she saw was a movie?

1615
01:32:02.800 --> 01:32:04.756
Not a movie. The movie.

1616
01:32:05.480 --> 01:32:06.549
The movie.

1617
01:32:06.720 --> 01:32:08.278
But the film burned up.

1618
01:32:08.440 --> 01:32:11.989
Well, how did she see it
two days after it supposedly burned up?


1619
01:32:12.160 --> 01:32:14.151
And the wardrobe matches perfectly.

1620
01:32:14.320 --> 01:32:17.232
So Amelia had a second print?
She had a copy?


1621
01:32:17.400 --> 01:32:18.719
Wouldn't you?

1622
01:32:18.920 --> 01:32:21.229
And she gave that copy to Misty.

1623
01:32:22.120 --> 01:32:25.157
So she comes here,
checks the film against that wall...


1624
01:32:25.320 --> 01:32:26.992
Lily sees it through that window.

1625
01:32:27.160 --> 01:32:29.754
And Amelia splits and takes the film.

1626
01:32:29.920 --> 01:32:32.115
And goes where?

1627
01:32:32.280 --> 01:32:33.280
Oh, for fuck...

1628
01:32:33.480 --> 01:32:35.436
I mean, can't we get to the next...

1629
01:32:35.600 --> 01:32:38.433
The Western Hotel to meet the businessmen.

1630
01:32:38.600 --> 01:32:40.079
Distributors.

1631
01:32:41.120 --> 01:32:43.759
She was screening it for the distributors.

1632
01:32:44.360 --> 01:32:45.713
She was showing them the film.

1633
01:32:45.880 --> 01:32:47.279
It's out there. 
The film exists.

1634
01:32:47.440 --> 01:32:49.192
Now we just have to find it.

1635
01:32:49.360 --> 01:32:50.554
<i>Guys, look.</i>

1636
01:32:50.720 --> 01:32:55.157
"Opening night, 9:00 p.m." Signed, Chet.

1637
01:32:55.320 --> 01:32:57.356
- Fucking Chet.
- The protestor guy?


1638
01:32:57.560 --> 01:32:59.278
Give me that shit.

1639
01:33:01.360 --> 01:33:03.749
She was planning something with Chet.

1640
01:33:03.920 --> 01:33:05.911
Opening night?

1641
01:33:06.160 --> 01:33:08.435
The LA auto show.

1642
01:33:09.120 --> 01:33:10.758
- It's today, right?
<i>- Yeah.</i>


1643
01:33:10.960 --> 01:33:14.032
Big party. Mucky-mucks. 
Loads of press.

1644
01:33:14.200 --> 01:33:15.936
If you wanted to get a story
out there, right?


1645
01:33:15.960 --> 01:33:17.757
And fucking Chet's a projectionalist.

1646
01:33:17.920 --> 01:33:19.200
<i>Please stop talking.</i>

1647
01:33:19.280 --> 01:33:22.238
I've been listening
to everything you said.


1648
01:33:22.440 --> 01:33:26.319
Does this mean...
Does this mean that my niece is dead?


1649
01:33:26.480 --> 01:33:27.629
Yes!

1650
01:33:28.840 --> 01:33:30.796
I mean, you know, yes.

1651
01:33:31.520 --> 01:33:34.637
- She was murdered. I'm sorry.
- Mmm-hmm.


1652
01:33:34.800 --> 01:33:37.268
But we're gonna bring down
the people who did it.


1653
01:33:37.440 --> 01:33:41.433
Yeah, and for a deeply
discounted rate, so...


1654
01:33:43.080 --> 01:33:48.200
<i>Welcome to Los Angeles
and the 1978 Pacific Coast Auto Show.</i>

<i>These all-new fuel-efficient systems.</i>

You guys know
where the projection room is?


1662
01:34:14.200 --> 01:34:15.336
You seen Chet, the projectionist?

1663
01:34:15.360 --> 01:34:17.456
Yeah, he just left
like 10 minutes ago, went for a drink.


1664
01:34:17.480 --> 01:34:18.674
And you are?

1665
01:34:18.840 --> 01:34:21.035
In a hurry. Thanks, buddy.

1666
01:34:21.200 --> 01:34:23.430

- Shit.

That's not the film.

1674
01:34:49.920 --> 01:34:51.399
Fucking Chet.

1675
01:34:51.560 --> 01:34:54.597
He's probably still got it
stashed somewhere.


1676
01:34:59.440 --> 01:35:03.877
Tally. Oh, my God, you look incredible.

1677

How do you get your hair to...
It's magnificent.


1678

Listen, I don't know
what's going on here,


1679

but there's been some foul play.

<i>Do you know that that
suitcase that you gave us,</i>


1681

somebody switched it out?

1682
01:35:16.400 --> 01:35:17.594
There was no money in it.

1683
01:35:17.760 --> 01:35:19.239
<i>No shit.</i>

1684
01:35:19.400 --> 01:35:20.992
Weapons on the floor. Now.

1685
01:35:21.160 --> 01:35:23.435
I guess
you killed the projectionist, huh?


1686
01:35:23.600 --> 01:35:25.955
No. My associate's out
looking for him now.


1687
01:35:26.120 --> 01:35:27.235
We'll find him.

1688
01:35:27.440 --> 01:35:29.749
Tally, let me ask you something.

1689
01:35:31.120 --> 01:35:32.712
You ever really killed anybody?

1690
01:35:32.880 --> 01:35:34.950
In Detroit, yeah. Three times.

1691
01:35:36.280 --> 01:35:37.599
Really?

1692
01:35:37.760 --> 01:35:40.115
That's where this all started.
The Detroit show.


1693
01:35:40.280 --> 01:35:42.840
That bitch Misty shooting her
mouth off about her new movie.


1694
01:35:43.040 --> 01:35:45.395
Tally, this is not you.

1695
01:35:45.560 --> 01:35:46.709
You're not a murderer.

1696
01:35:46.920 --> 01:35:49.514
She just said she killed three people.

1697
01:35:49.680 --> 01:35:51.159
I know, but I'm saying deep down.

1698
01:35:51.320 --> 01:35:52.576
<i>Hey, look, one's a mistake.</i>

1699
01:35:52.600 --> 01:35:54.896
- By the time you get to three...
- Don't paint her with that brush.


1700
01:35:54.920 --> 01:35:56.176
I guess it's easy
to live in your world, right,


1701
01:35:56.200 --> 01:35:57.336
where everyone sits in their place.

1702
01:35:57.360 --> 01:35:58.440
See what's in front of you.

1703
01:35:58.600 --> 01:36:00.216
She's got a gun and she's killed three...

1704
01:36:00.240 --> 01:36:01.240
<i>Come on, man.</i>

1705
01:36:01.400 --> 01:36:02.576
You don't know her upbringing.

1706
01:36:02.600 --> 01:36:04.256
- You gotta face the situation.
<i>- You don't know what she...</i>

<i>Room service.</i>

- Shit. No.
- What's wrong with him?


1709
01:36:09.120 --> 01:36:10.917
I don't know. I'm gonna ask him.

1710
01:36:11.080 --> 01:36:12.911
- March?
- Yeah?


1711
01:36:13.520 --> 01:36:14.953
Uh, what the fuck are you doing?

1712
01:36:15.120 --> 01:36:16.394
Did you move it?

1713
01:36:16.560 --> 01:36:18.152
- Move what?
- The fucking gun.


1714
01:36:18.320 --> 01:36:20.834
- What gun?
- The fucking ankle gun.


1715
01:36:21.040 --> 01:36:22.632
Who told you I had an ankle gun?

1716
01:36:22.800 --> 01:36:24.320
You did. In the car before we crashed.

1717
01:36:24.440 --> 01:36:26.096
You were like,
"Oh, check out my ankle gun."


1718
01:36:26.120 --> 01:36:27.456
You know, you showed me your ankle gun.

1719
01:36:27.480 --> 01:36:30.472
Come on. Are you serious?
Are you fucking serious?


1720
01:36:30.640 --> 01:36:31.720
- Oh, shit.
- Yeah.


1721
01:36:31.840 --> 01:36:34.798
- Did I dream that?
- Yeah, you moron, you dreamt it.


1722
01:36:34.960 --> 01:36:36.473
No, no, no, no.

1723
01:36:37.440 --> 01:36:38.839
Yeah, you're right, that was...

1724
01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:41.230
Just shut up! Shut up! Both of you.

1725

<i>Room service.</i>

1726
01:36:44.080 --> 01:36:46.196
- This takes the fucking cake.
- Shh!


1727
01:36:46.760 --> 01:36:49.433
Holly, you can come in now.

1728
01:36:53.760 --> 01:36:55.671
Very clever, Holly.

1729
01:36:57.200 --> 01:36:59.270
Thanks. I thought so.

1730
01:37:02.920 --> 01:37:05.036
Why did you just
throw cold coffee on me?

1731
01:37:05.200 --> 01:37:08.272
I got it in the hallway.
I thought it was hot.


1732
01:37:08.440 --> 01:37:10.016
I like where your head's at, sweetheart.

1733
01:37:10.040 --> 01:37:11.400
That really could have worked out.

1734
01:37:11.480 --> 01:37:14.040
All right, you know, everybody,
in the corner. Come on.


1735
01:37:15.040 --> 01:37:17.031
Shit.

1736
01:37:21.280 --> 01:37:23.874
- Well, that really worked out.
- Yeah.


1737
01:37:26.400 --> 01:37:29.915
Now we just gotta find that
fucking Chet before John Boy does.


1738
01:37:30.080 --> 01:37:32.080
Yeah. Well, that guy said
he was going for a drink.


1739
01:37:32.240 --> 01:37:35.038
You take the roof bar.
I'll take downstairs.


1740
01:37:35.200 --> 01:37:36.428
- Well done, kiddo.
- Thanks.


1741
01:37:42.480 --> 01:37:45.074
- You the projectionist?
- Mmm-hmm.


1742
01:37:45.240 --> 01:37:46.673
Look, we got a problem on nine.

1743
01:37:46.840 --> 01:37:48.319
Someone knocked over the projector.

1744
01:37:48.480 --> 01:37:49.680
The film's all over the floor.

1745
01:37:49.720 --> 01:37:52.109
- Film's on the floor? Really?
- Yeah, it's a mess.


1746
01:37:52.280 --> 01:37:53.952
You follow me?

1747
01:38:03.760 --> 01:38:05.910
Okay, just wait here.
I'm gonna take a look around.


1748
01:38:06.080 --> 01:38:07.080
I wanna help.

1749
01:38:07.240 --> 01:38:09.629
You can help by staying put, okay?

1750
01:38:09.800 --> 01:38:11.199
Promise me you'll get the film?

1751
01:38:11.400 --> 01:38:12.799
Yeah, I promise.

1752
01:38:12.960 --> 01:38:14.393
Pinky promise?

1753
01:38:18.600 --> 01:38:19.794
Fuck.

1754
01:38:27.440 --> 01:38:29.590
Hey, pal, what can I do you for?

1755
01:38:31.080 --> 01:38:33.275
Free drinks. What do you have?

1756
01:38:33.440 --> 01:38:34.759
Little guy, stringy hair.

1757
01:38:34.960 --> 01:38:37.155
I think they went out through those doors.

1758
01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:44.956
Hey, Chet? Chet?

1759
01:38:53.880 --> 01:38:56.394
Hey. Hey, Chet.

1760
01:38:56.560 --> 01:39:01.111
Amelia's film, where is it?

1761
01:39:01.600 --> 01:39:04.512
The film is in the projector.
Repeat, it's in the projector.


1762
01:39:05.160 --> 01:39:06.434
But we already checked that.

1763
01:39:07.800 --> 01:39:10.633
- Spliced in.
- What?


1764
01:39:10.800 --> 01:39:14.509
It's spliced into the middle of it,
right in the other film. Go get it.


1765
01:39:14.680 --> 01:39:16.193
On my way.

1766
01:39:22.800 --> 01:39:25.758
Don't you know it's rude to eavesdrop?

1767
01:39:27.160 --> 01:39:29.879
I got a gun pointed directly
at your daughter's spine.


1768
01:39:30.040 --> 01:39:33.476
Come with me. Come on, baby.

1769
01:39:46.880 --> 01:39:47.880
How does that song go?

1770
01:39:53.080 --> 01:39:54.308
<i>Welcome, Los Angeles,</i>

1771
01:39:54.480 --> 01:39:57.392
<i>to the finest fleet of automobiles
Detroit has to offer,</i>


1772
01:39:57.560 --> 01:40:00.677
<i>giving the world luxury redefined.</i>

1773
01:40:01.080 --> 01:40:03.150
<i>In addition to the most
distinctive styling,</i>


1774
01:40:03.320 --> 01:40:06.232
<i>we are bringing you interiors
that are comfort assured,</i>


1775
01:40:06.400 --> 01:40:10.188
<i>combining velour, leather,
wood paneling and an improved...</i>


1776
01:40:10.720 --> 01:40:13.188
Help him up.

1777
01:40:16.480 --> 01:40:18.391
Why'd you have to bring the goddamn kid?

1778
01:40:20.800 --> 01:40:21.949
I fucked up.

1779
01:40:22.120 --> 01:40:23.269
Yeah, you fucked up.

1780
01:40:25.080 --> 01:40:26.229
<i>America...</i>

1781
01:40:41.400 --> 01:40:43.197
Oh, my God.

1782
01:40:43.360 --> 01:40:44.360
Fuck, fuck.

1783
01:40:44.520 --> 01:40:46.000
Do you want her
to see you like this?

1784
01:40:46.080 --> 01:40:47.336
You fucking drunk.

1785
01:40:47.360 --> 01:40:48.918
Oh, don't start that crying shit.

1786
01:40:49.080 --> 01:40:50.308
<i>I fucked up.</i>

1787
01:40:50.480 --> 01:40:51.800
You drunk motherfucker, you.

1788
01:40:51.920 --> 01:40:53.876
- I love you.
<i>- It's embarrassing.</i>


1789
01:40:54.040 --> 01:40:56.600
I'm sorry. Duck.

1790
01:40:56.760 --> 01:40:57.909
- What?
- Duck.


1791
01:41:00.280 --> 01:41:01.759
Motherfucker!

1792
01:41:15.640 --> 01:41:17.119
<i>Well, I'm Bulging Paulsen</i>

1793
01:41:17.280 --> 01:41:19.919
<i>and I represent the Detroit
auto manufacturers.</i>


1794
01:41:20.080 --> 01:41:21.479
<i>That's who the hell I am.</i>

1795
01:41:21.640 --> 01:41:25.349
<i>You poison our air.
The people won't stand for it.</i>


1796
01:41:30.440 --> 01:41:31.509
Nixon!

1797
01:41:33.040 --> 01:41:34.951
No!

1798
01:41:37.640 --> 01:41:39.949
<i>I might be persuaded
to change my mind.</i>


1799
01:41:40.120 --> 01:41:43.237
<i>Perhaps if we came
to a monetary arrangement.</i>


1800
01:41:43.440 --> 01:41:46.318
<i>I'll take a wire transfer.
It's a Union Federal account.</i>


1801
01:41:46.480 --> 01:41:47.799
<i>Number 22-12.</i>

1802
01:41:47.960 --> 01:41:49.632
<i>Just tell them the exact amounts.</i>

1803
01:41:49.800 --> 01:41:51.279
He's got a gun!

1804
01:42:13.320 --> 01:42:14.753
Oh, my God.

1805
01:42:19.320 --> 01:42:21.550
Three, two, one.

1806
01:42:24.680 --> 01:42:26.079
Jesus!

1807
01:42:35.680 --> 01:42:38.069
How'd you get down here?
I told you to go to the roof.


1808
01:42:38.240 --> 01:42:40.231
- Did you fall?
- Yeah.


1809
01:42:42.080 --> 01:42:43.399
Jesus Christ, are you kidding?

1810
01:42:43.560 --> 01:42:44.834
I think I'm invincible.

1811
01:42:45.000 --> 01:42:46.376
<i>It's the only thing that makes sense.</i>

1812
01:42:46.400 --> 01:42:48.311
- I don't think I can die.
- Where's the film?


1813
01:42:48.480 --> 01:42:50.869
It's up there. 
We just gotta go get it.

1814
01:42:58.600 --> 01:43:00.318
You get out of here, you little shit.

1815
01:43:04.600 --> 01:43:07.876
You give me that,
you fucked-up little hippy.


1816
01:43:08.040 --> 01:43:11.669
You want it? Go get it.

1817
01:43:11.840 --> 01:43:13.432
No!

1818
01:43:25.640 --> 01:43:28.393
Get me that fucking film. Move it.

1819
01:43:28.560 --> 01:43:30.551
- Cover me.
- What... March! March!


1820
01:43:33.280 --> 01:43:34.793
Drop your weapon!

1821
01:43:43.440 --> 01:43:44.759
Fuck.

1822
01:43:45.560 --> 01:43:47.915
March, go. I got this.

1823
01:44:30.640 --> 01:44:31.914
Hey!

1824
01:45:00.160 --> 01:45:03.072
<i>Run! Just run!</i>

1825
01:45:17.680 --> 01:45:19.636
Mr. Healy, what are you doing?

1826
01:45:19.800 --> 01:45:20.835
Go away, Holly.

1827
01:45:22.840 --> 01:45:26.037
Healy, stop! You don't have to kill him!

1828
01:45:27.760 --> 01:45:31.036
Mr. Healy, if you kill this man,
I will never speak to you again.


1829
01:45:47.240 --> 01:45:48.878
Congratulations, buddy.

1830
01:45:49.040 --> 01:45:51.395
You owe your life to a 13-year-old girl.

1831
01:46:25.720 --> 01:46:28.518
Come on, let's go
down and see your dad.

1832
01:46:29.120 --> 01:46:31.236
And that would be the cops.

1833
01:46:42.240 --> 01:46:43.958
Sir? Sir, are you all right?

1834
01:46:44.160 --> 01:46:46.674
Sir, is anyone left in the building?

1835
01:46:48.080 --> 01:46:49.080
<i>He's not responsive.</i>

1836
01:46:49.240 --> 01:46:50.696
<i>All right, let's find out who else is...</i>

1837
01:46:50.720 --> 01:46:54.076
<i>And sometimes... 
Sometimes,</i>

1838
01:46:55.960 --> 01:46:58.110
<i>you just win.</i>

1839
01:47:07.960 --> 01:47:09.996
Jesus Christ.

1840
01:47:11.080 --> 01:47:12.638
Oh, shit.

1841
01:47:12.800 --> 01:47:14.631
You know what? 
Don't even talk to her.

1842
01:47:14.800 --> 01:47:16.950
Don't even look at her, man.

1843
01:47:18.480 --> 01:47:19.549
Fuck.

1844
01:47:20.320 --> 01:47:22.470
Oh, boys, boys.

1845
01:47:23.360 --> 01:47:26.079
You really think you've got
something done here.


1846
01:47:26.240 --> 01:47:28.674
Do you have a clue what just happened?

1847
01:47:29.760 --> 01:47:32.593
It was protocol. 
I followed protocol.

1848
01:47:38.920 --> 01:47:40.194
What's wrong with him?

1849
01:47:40.360 --> 01:47:44.672
I believe he's making a connection
between you and Adolf Hitler.


1850
01:47:46.120 --> 01:47:48.475
Read the fucking newspaper.

1851
01:47:48.680 --> 01:47:51.478
What's good for Detroit
is good for America.


1852
01:47:51.640 --> 01:47:52.640
Unbelievable.

1853
01:47:52.800 --> 01:47:57.112
The America I love
owes its life to the Big Three.


1854
01:47:58.520 --> 01:48:00.416
But it's all right for you
to fail your daughter?


1855
01:48:00.440 --> 01:48:01.839
Detroit had her killed.

1856
01:48:02.000 --> 01:48:03.194
I think I read about that.

1857
01:48:03.360 --> 01:48:05.999
The whole city got together, took a vote.
Big turnout.


1858
01:48:06.200 --> 01:48:07.474
I wanted her safe.

1859
01:48:07.640 --> 01:48:09.835
That's why I hired you two.

1860
01:48:10.040 --> 01:48:12.235
You're going to jail, Mrs. Kuttner.

1861
01:48:13.200 --> 01:48:16.875
I might be going to jail,
but it won't make a difference.


1862
01:48:18.960 --> 01:48:21.394
You can't take Detroit down.

1863
01:48:23.560 --> 01:48:27.519
And if I'm not there
to take care of it,

1864
01:48:27.720 --> 01:48:29.915
someone else will be.

1865
01:48:30.840 --> 01:48:34.196
Okay, well, we shall see.

1866
01:48:40.200 --> 01:48:44.910
Ho, ho, ho! Merry Christmas, everybody.
Merry Christmas!


1867
01:48:46.720 --> 01:48:47.869
Jesus.

1868
01:48:49.040 --> 01:48:50.553
Where is he?

1869
01:48:58.480 --> 01:48:59.708
Scotch.

1870
01:49:01.320 --> 01:49:02.389
Did you see the TV?

1871
01:49:03.760 --> 01:49:04.954
Yeah, I saw.

1872
01:49:06.080 --> 01:49:09.072
They're gonna let them off,
the car companies, scot-free.


1873
01:49:09.240 --> 01:49:11.276
Not enough evidence of collusion, you see.

1874
01:49:11.440 --> 01:49:12.759
I heard.

1875
01:49:14.240 --> 01:49:16.595
The sun went up, the sun went down.

1876
01:49:16.760 --> 01:49:19.593
Nothing changes, just like you said.

1877
01:49:19.760 --> 01:49:24.197
Look, they got away with it.
Big surprise, you know?


1878
01:49:27.720 --> 01:49:31.110
People are stupid.
But they're not that stupid.


1879
01:49:31.760 --> 01:49:34.433
The point is five years tops,

1880
01:49:34.640 --> 01:49:37.234
we're all driving
electric cars from Japan, anyway.


1881
01:49:37.400 --> 01:49:38.958
Mark my words.

1882
01:49:39.920 --> 01:49:41.478
Look at this.

1883
01:49:43.840 --> 01:49:46.149
You ever see the bad-breath tie?

1884
01:49:47.960 --> 01:49:49.791
Breathe on it.

1885
01:49:53.960 --> 01:49:56.554
Works every time. Kills Holly.

1886
01:49:59.280 --> 01:50:00.520
At least you're drinking again.

1887
01:50:00.680 --> 01:50:03.797
Yeah. I feel great.

1888
01:50:04.880 --> 01:50:06.313
You know, nobody got hurt.

1889
01:50:06.480 --> 01:50:07.993
A few people got hurt.

1890
01:50:08.200 --> 01:50:09.496
I'm saying I think
they died quickly, though,


1891
01:50:09.520 --> 01:50:10.960
so I don't think that they got hurt.

1892
01:50:11.880 --> 01:50:13.393
Look at this.

1893
01:50:16.480 --> 01:50:18.630
<i>- I'm sorry you look Filipino.
- I do.</i>


1894
01:50:19.560 --> 01:50:21.391
Or I look Mexican.

1895
01:50:21.560 --> 01:50:24.028
<i>And we already got
our first case.</i>


1896
01:50:24.200 --> 01:50:25.838
- Old lady in Glendale.
- Mmm-hmm.


1897
01:50:26.000 --> 01:50:27.880
Thinks her husband's
sleeping with Lynda Carter.


1898
01:50:27.920 --> 01:50:29.353
Wonder Woman?

1899
01:50:29.520 --> 01:50:31.078
Or Lynda Carter.

1900
01:50:31.240 --> 01:50:32.600
That's what we have to figure out.

1901
01:50:32.760 --> 01:50:33.795
Right.

1902
01:50:33.960 --> 01:50:36.520
- But he's 82, so it's time sensitive.
- Hmm.


1903
01:50:36.680 --> 01:50:38.200
<i>What do you say?</i>

1904
01:50:38.880 --> 01:50:39.995
Shit.

1905
01:50:44.160 --> 01:50:45.718
To the birds.

1906
01:50:45.880 --> 01:50:47.313
Hallelujah.
