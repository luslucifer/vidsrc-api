1
00:01:13.814 --> 00:01:19.945
In my life, I've only painted
the honest expression of myself.


2
00:01:22.114 --> 00:01:25.993
To say what I
couldn't in any other way.

3
00:01:28.913 --> 00:01:32.416
I paint because I need to.

4
00:03:37.541 --> 00:03:41.337
Who would've thought
that stains of color can come to life


5
00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:44.340
and help one live?

6
00:03:47.384 --> 00:03:52.014
Mexico was my entire universe.

7
00:03:53.974 --> 00:03:57.019
I was happy.

8
00:04:06.278 --> 00:04:10.449
I ran through every corner of my yard

9
00:04:11.116 --> 00:04:16.080
and I'd shout and
laugh from under a tree.

10
00:04:33.722 --> 00:04:36.892
My mom was obsessively religious.

11
00:04:37.893 --> 00:04:41.188
She invited priests to
hold Mass at my house


12
00:04:41.605 --> 00:04:45.567
and her friends would
come to pray the rosary.


13
00:04:46.694 --> 00:04:49.363
While everyone was praying

14
00:04:49.863 --> 00:04:53.575
I tried not to laugh.

15
00:04:57.121 --> 00:05:02.001
I remember asking about the
Mysteries of the Bible.


16
00:05:03.168 --> 00:05:10.134
They'd always say,
"To dedicate oneself more to God."


17
00:05:21.895 --> 00:05:26.275
But I kept bothering the priest
with questions.


18
00:05:27.901 --> 00:05:29.987
How was Christ born?

19
00:05:31.572 --> 00:05:35.200
Was the Virgin Mary really a virgin?

20
00:05:41.081 --> 00:05:45.252
They threw me out
for spoiling it for the other kids.


21
00:05:52.301 --> 00:05:54.678
My father was a photographer.

22
00:05:54.970 --> 00:05:58.766
I was fascinated with his studio.

23
00:06:00.392 --> 00:06:05.105
Papa was an atheist
and the only one in the house who read


24
00:06:05.773 --> 00:06:11.111
books about science,
geography, and history.


25
00:06:17.201 --> 00:06:20.537
I went everywhere with my father.

26
00:06:21.997 --> 00:06:25.793
He would paint small
landscapes by the river


27
00:06:26.752 --> 00:06:30.464
with watercolors and oil paints.

28
00:06:36.095 --> 00:06:42.476
Papa kept his box of paints
tucked away in his studio.


29
00:06:43.393 --> 00:06:48.148
And I really wanted that box.

30
00:06:52.778 --> 00:06:54.029
Green

31
00:06:54.613 --> 00:06:57.783
good warm light

32
00:06:59.159 --> 00:07:00.661
Magenta

33
00:07:01.370 --> 00:07:03.122
Aztec

34
00:07:04.540 --> 00:07:06.083
Mexican red

35
00:07:06.333 --> 00:07:09.044
old blood of the prickly pear

36
00:07:09.878 --> 00:07:11.255
Brown

37
00:07:11.672 --> 00:07:13.298
color of molé

38
00:07:14.007 --> 00:07:15.217
earth

39
00:07:16.927 --> 00:07:18.137
Yellow

40
00:07:19.012 --> 00:07:22.266
sun and happiness

41
00:07:30.149 --> 00:07:33.986
I was a girl who walked
through a world full of colors


42
00:07:34.486 --> 00:07:36.613
of tangible forms.

43
00:07:41.201 --> 00:07:44.079
Everything was mysterious
and held secrets.


44
00:07:55.257 --> 00:07:59.428
Deciphering the world was like a game.

45
00:08:21.783 --> 00:08:23.785
I wanted to be a doctor

46
00:08:24.912 --> 00:08:27.915
so I attended the National
Preparatory School.


47
00:08:32.711 --> 00:08:38.508
I didn't like it at first because
I had to go upstairs with the other girls.


48
00:08:39.968 --> 00:08:41.887
All the girls would say

49
00:08:42.179 --> 00:08:44.806
"Frida is a little strange."

50
00:08:48.310 --> 00:08:52.481
I ended up befriending a group called
the <i>Cachuchas.</i>


51
00:08:56.360 --> 00:08:58.153
We wore caps

52
00:08:58.278 --> 00:09:01.615
and I was the only girl.

53
00:09:11.291 --> 00:09:14.544
When Frida arrived
at the school she was rebellious


54
00:09:14.628 --> 00:09:17.714
and defied tradition.

55
00:09:20.342 --> 00:09:25.722
She was drawn to rebellious young men

56
00:09:26.348 --> 00:09:29.476
and she joined our group.

57
00:09:39.611 --> 00:09:42.864
I followed the <i>Cachuchas</i> everywhere

58
00:09:43.657 --> 00:09:47.953
and took part in all of their mischief.

59
00:09:57.546 --> 00:10:00.257
We strapped firecrackers on a dog

60
00:10:00.382 --> 00:10:02.926
and we sent it into the school.

61
00:10:04.928 --> 00:10:10.600
We wreaked havoc
and got all the classes suspended.


62
00:10:13.312 --> 00:10:18.525
Frida was standing in a hallway
dying of laughter.


63
00:10:24.114 --> 00:10:27.826
I would go to the boys' classes
instead of going to mine.


64
00:10:28.035 --> 00:10:30.203
I barely passed my classes

65
00:10:30.579 --> 00:10:33.415
or I would cheat to get good grades.

66
00:10:43.425 --> 00:10:46.428
Alejandro was a leader at school.

67
00:10:47.137 --> 00:10:51.433
He took part in all of
the student protests.


68
00:10:53.352 --> 00:10:57.356
I'm attracted to intelligent people.

69
00:10:57.898 --> 00:11:02.861
I choose those I
feel are superior to me.

70
00:11:04.404 --> 00:11:05.822
My Alex

71
00:11:06.823 --> 00:11:08.700
My beloved Alex

72
00:11:09.826 --> 00:11:11.203
My Alex

73
00:11:14.748 --> 00:11:17.459
I wanted Alejandro to fuck me

74
00:11:18.001 --> 00:11:20.253
but he preferred to tell me nice things.

75
00:11:20.545 --> 00:11:22.339
He'd recite poetry

76
00:11:22.422 --> 00:11:25.425
and give me kisses and hugs.

77
00:11:28.136 --> 00:11:31.848
I think that everything
that gives pleasure is good.


78
00:11:37.687 --> 00:11:40.148
Breath

79
00:11:40.732 --> 00:11:42.442
scent

80
00:11:43.193 --> 00:11:45.153
armpit

81
00:11:45.570 --> 00:11:47.406
love

82
00:11:48.657 --> 00:11:51.034
abyss

83
00:12:23.024 --> 00:12:27.279
That day I took a bus with Alejandro.

84
00:12:29.823 --> 00:12:34.703
I sat next to the handrail
and Alejandro sat next to me.


85
00:12:36.121 --> 00:12:40.083
Shortly after getting on the bus
the crash started.


86
00:12:42.919 --> 00:12:46.381
A trolley approached our bus slowly

87
00:12:47.048 --> 00:12:48.800
hitting us straight in the middle.

88
00:12:51.636 --> 00:12:55.557
The bus had a strange elasticity.

89
00:12:56.266 --> 00:12:58.935
It bent more and more.

90
00:12:59.769 --> 00:13:02.772
When it reached its breaking point

91
00:13:03.190 --> 00:13:05.358
it burst into a thousand pieces.

92
00:13:12.866 --> 00:13:14.493
It wasn't violent

93
00:13:16.536 --> 00:13:18.497
but silent.

94
00:13:18.747 --> 00:13:20.290
Slow.

95
00:13:21.208 --> 00:13:27.088
The handrail went through me
like a sword through a bull.


96
00:13:30.258 --> 00:13:33.512
It's a lie that one realizes the crash.

97
00:13:34.846 --> 00:13:37.098
A lie that one cries.

98
00:13:38.433 --> 00:13:41.561
I had no tears.

99
00:13:43.438 --> 00:13:48.693
I didn't understand
the kind of wounds I had suffered.


100
00:13:49.486 --> 00:13:53.532
I thought I came out unscathed.

101
00:13:59.913 --> 00:14:02.249
I ended up under the trolley.

102
00:14:04.417 --> 00:14:09.839
As soon as I was able to get up
I looked for Frida.


103
00:14:12.676 --> 00:14:18.265
Horrified, I realized that
a piece of iron had pierced her body.


104
00:14:19.516 --> 00:14:22.519
A man said, "We
need to take it out."

105
00:14:22.602 --> 00:14:26.648
He put his knee on Frida's body
and pulled it out.


106
00:14:30.026 --> 00:14:36.908
Frida screamed so loud
you couldn't hear the ambulance's siren.


107
00:14:39.119 --> 00:14:45.542
CRASH WRECKS BUS

108
00:14:49.170 --> 00:14:52.090
The doctors didn't think
they could save her.


109
00:15:09.065 --> 00:15:14.529
It will take a long time
for the fracture in my pelvis to mend


110
00:15:15.030 --> 00:15:18.033
and for the wounds
in my foot to heal.

111
00:15:22.037 --> 00:15:26.708
The doctor thinks
I will have to stay like this


112
00:15:27.626 --> 00:15:30.462
for three or four months.

113
00:15:39.804 --> 00:15:44.100
I now inhabit a world of pain

114
00:15:45.935 --> 00:15:48.229
transparent

115
00:15:48.605 --> 00:15:50.690
like ice.

116
00:15:51.191 --> 00:15:54.277
It no longer holds mystery.

117
00:16:07.165 --> 00:16:09.751
The crash destroyed me

118
00:16:10.126 --> 00:16:12.545
but at least Lady Death didn't take me.

119
00:16:16.633 --> 00:16:20.637
Everyone tells me not to despair

120
00:16:24.307 --> 00:16:28.812
but no one knows
what it's like for me

121
00:16:29.270 --> 00:16:34.776
having been free in the
streets all my life.


122
00:16:40.448 --> 00:16:45.662
I feel trapped by
the walls in my room.

123
00:16:46.621 --> 00:16:51.334
I'm alone with my soul.

124
00:17:00.176 --> 00:17:08.176
My mother devised a wooden contraption
where I could attach my papers.


125
00:17:10.228 --> 00:17:18.228
She also hung a mirror over my bed
so I could use myself as a model.


126
00:17:21.030 --> 00:17:24.242
I started painting portraits of my friends.

127
00:17:28.788 --> 00:17:30.540
Dear Agustín

128
00:17:31.040 --> 00:17:34.127
I painted your portrait with love.

129
00:17:37.547 --> 00:17:39.632
Beautiful Alicia

130
00:17:40.300 --> 00:17:45.305
I'm sending you all my love.
Your pal, Friducha.


131
00:17:47.515 --> 00:17:50.268
Miguel, little brother

132
00:17:50.852 --> 00:17:53.646
don't ever forget about <i>Cachucha</i>number 9

133
00:17:53.730 --> 00:17:55.857
Frida Kahlo.

134
00:17:57.400 --> 00:17:59.068
Alex

135
00:17:59.652 --> 00:18:02.197
this is so you don't forget me.

136
00:18:02.947 --> 00:18:05.492
Don't stop writing to me.

137
00:18:09.579 --> 00:18:12.040
Here is my portrait, Alex.

138
00:18:12.749 --> 00:18:15.835
It'll be at your
house in a few days.

139
00:18:16.836 --> 00:18:20.965
I beg you, hang it low

140
00:18:21.800 --> 00:18:26.513
so you can see it
as if you were looking straight at me.


141
00:18:53.957 --> 00:18:57.252
After a year in many casts

142
00:18:57.585 --> 00:19:03.258
I still felt very sore
and had little strength.


143
00:19:04.133 --> 00:19:12.133
But I want to be productive
with the health I have left.


144
00:19:24.445 --> 00:19:29.534
When the Revolution started
I was aware of what was happening.


145
00:19:31.286 --> 00:19:38.126
I was four when I witnessed Zapata's
peasant fight against the establishment.


146
00:19:43.131 --> 00:19:48.678
The peasants took up arms to seize
the bread that the rich denied them.


147
00:19:49.512 --> 00:19:51.764
Land and freedom.

148
00:19:56.227 --> 00:20:03.067
In Mexico, <i>coraje</i> means
becoming violent when you face injustice.


149
00:20:09.699 --> 00:20:12.952
I feel the pain of the oppressed.

150
00:20:13.494 --> 00:20:17.332
I feel the need to fight for them.

151
00:20:18.374 --> 00:20:23.212
That's why as soon as they allowed me
to walk after the accident


152
00:20:23.338 --> 00:20:26.257
I joined the Communist party.

153
00:20:33.723 --> 00:20:37.018
MEXICAN ART REFLECTS NEW VALUES

154
00:20:37.101 --> 00:20:40.688
ART AND REVOLUTION

155
00:20:57.664 --> 00:21:02.377
The spirit of the Revolution

156
00:21:02.794 --> 00:21:06.255
was the foundation for my determination.

157
00:21:28.945 --> 00:21:34.117
Diego Rivera was painting frescoes
at the Ministry of Education.


158
00:21:48.589 --> 00:21:50.633
Diego is a communist.

159
00:21:50.967 --> 00:21:56.264
His creative work is at the service of
the social revolution.


160
00:22:05.440 --> 00:22:07.442
He has great taste.

161
00:22:08.860 --> 00:22:12.280
He admires everything that emanates beauty

162
00:22:13.281 --> 00:22:18.870
whether it comes from
a woman or a mountain.


163
00:22:37.513 --> 00:22:42.685
I had only seen him from far away
but I admired him greatly.


164
00:22:44.145 --> 00:22:49.567
One day I brought him four paintings
and just like that I said


165
00:22:50.401 --> 00:22:52.904
"Diego! Get down!"

166
00:22:55.073 --> 00:23:00.453
I looked down from my
scaffold and saw a girl of about eighteen.


167
00:23:02.038 --> 00:23:06.167
She had a pretty
body and a delicate face.

168
00:23:08.961 --> 00:23:12.590
Look, I haven't come to flirt with you.

169
00:23:13.132 --> 00:23:17.595
Even though you're a womanizer
I've come to show you my paintings.


170
00:23:19.931 --> 00:23:24.393
If you're interested, let me know.
If not, that's fine.


171
00:23:24.602 --> 00:23:28.815
So I can find another
way to help my parents.


172
00:23:31.609 --> 00:23:34.570
I was impressed.

173
00:23:34.821 --> 00:23:39.158
Her canvases revealed
an unusual expressive energy.


174
00:23:39.367 --> 00:23:44.163
"In my opinion, you must continue
to paint," I said at once.


175
00:23:44.956 --> 00:23:48.584
He told me, "You have talent."

176
00:23:49.836 --> 00:23:53.714
That's when my courtship with Diego began.

177
00:24:17.446 --> 00:24:19.949
Diego is a big kid.

178
00:24:20.658 --> 00:24:24.412
His bulging eyes are never still

179
00:24:24.787 --> 00:24:29.125
as if they were made for a painter.

180
00:24:31.335 --> 00:24:39.335
His fleshy lips always show
a mischievous and tender smile.


181
00:24:41.846 --> 00:24:44.390
She got a kick
out of hearing him talk.

182
00:24:44.849 --> 00:24:50.354
She'd tease him and rile him up.

183
00:24:51.731 --> 00:24:54.442
I saw Diego had a new girl.

184
00:24:54.525 --> 00:24:56.944
She was quite a young lady.

185
00:24:58.029 --> 00:25:00.740
Almost at once, he
painted her into a mural.


186
00:25:02.992 --> 00:25:05.244
"You have a dog face," he told her.

187
00:25:05.328 --> 00:25:08.748
"And you," she retorted,
"have the face of a frog."


188
00:25:09.749 --> 00:25:11.069
Toad Face

189
00:25:11.125 --> 00:25:13.228
became her favorite name for him,

190
00:25:13.252 --> 00:25:15.087
varied with the epithet...

191
00:25:15.379 --> 00:25:16.659
Fatbelly

192
00:25:16.714 --> 00:25:18.734
and sometimes the tenderer...

193
00:25:18.758 --> 00:25:20.718
Little Diego

194
00:25:21.052 --> 00:25:25.431
Then he began
asking for her opinion of his own work.


195
00:25:25.514 --> 00:25:28.517
Her verdict was at times quite unfavorable.

196
00:25:29.602 --> 00:25:33.856
He would grumble, but the next day,
he would alter the offending detail.


197
00:25:38.861 --> 00:25:41.239
I used to dress like a boy.

198
00:25:44.450 --> 00:25:49.413
But when I started seeing Diego
I put on traditional Tehuana dresses.


199
00:26:04.262 --> 00:26:08.891
You will be called Auxochrome
the one who captures color.


200
00:26:09.558 --> 00:26:14.563
I, Chromophore, the one that gives color.

201
00:26:37.545 --> 00:26:41.716
DIEGO RIVERA IS MARRIED

202
00:26:42.842 --> 00:26:49.307
Everyone said it was like
marrying an elephant to a dove.


203
00:27:00.860 --> 00:27:03.446
I want to have a son

204
00:27:04.071 --> 00:27:07.158
because this is a man's world.

205
00:27:08.492 --> 00:27:11.078
I want him to look like Diego.

206
00:27:13.664 --> 00:27:18.794
If I were to have a girl
I would like her to look a bit like me


207
00:27:19.712 --> 00:27:21.714
but prettier.

208
00:27:30.723 --> 00:27:35.644
I would go to see Diego every day
while he painted.


209
00:27:36.645 --> 00:27:42.943
It pleased him to see me arrive
with food in a basket covered in flowers.


210
00:27:52.328 --> 00:27:56.123
I was working as much
as seven days a week

211
00:27:56.207 --> 00:28:00.753
and 18 hours a day on
government commissions.


212
00:28:04.548 --> 00:28:11.680
When an art dealer offered me a one-man show
at the Museum of Modern Art in New York


213
00:28:11.889 --> 00:28:14.183
I got incredibly excited.

214
00:28:15.434 --> 00:28:21.065
For an artist this is the pinnacle
of professional success.


215
00:28:33.953 --> 00:28:35.037
Here it is

216
00:28:35.704 --> 00:28:36.956
the might

217
00:28:37.790 --> 00:28:38.999
the power

218
00:28:39.875 --> 00:28:41.335
the glory

219
00:28:41.585 --> 00:28:43.838
the youthfulness of our lands.

220
00:28:48.968 --> 00:28:53.013
Noted
Mexican painter Diego Rivera has arrived.


221
00:28:54.306 --> 00:28:58.686
A petite, birdlike woman, Señora Rivera
smiled from behind her husband.


222
00:29:01.522 --> 00:29:04.233
New York is so massive

223
00:29:04.567 --> 00:29:08.279
I can't believe it was built by people.

224
00:29:11.574 --> 00:29:15.619
Our hotel is right
in front of Central Park

225
00:29:16.287 --> 00:29:19.290
only a block away from 5th Avenue.

226
00:29:31.051 --> 00:29:35.514
Some neighborhoods in New York
are much more interesting than ours.


227
00:29:39.268 --> 00:29:41.020
We went to Harlem.

228
00:29:41.437 --> 00:29:43.772
It's a beautiful thing to see.

229
00:29:51.489 --> 00:29:55.451
There are immigrant communities
from every part of the world.


230
00:29:58.704 --> 00:30:03.000
The celebrations in Chinatown
feel like the ones in Mexico.


231
00:30:03.709 --> 00:30:06.587
Full of fireworks and colors.

232
00:30:19.600 --> 00:30:22.645
We received a magnificent welcome

233
00:30:23.395 --> 00:30:27.566
and we were feted at parties,
dinners, and receptions.


234
00:30:28.150 --> 00:30:31.195
Diego is the big shit here.

235
00:30:32.696 --> 00:30:38.452
High society people lead
the most stupid lives.


236
00:30:39.995 --> 00:30:47.211
They all spout nonsense
and brag about their millions.


237
00:30:49.338 --> 00:30:52.591
You also need to own tons of dresses.

238
00:30:53.467 --> 00:30:58.597
If you show up looking disheveled
they will eat you alive.


239
00:31:01.934 --> 00:31:04.270
But Mexico is in style now

240
00:31:04.895 --> 00:31:08.399
and all of my dresses
catch their attention.


241
00:31:08.899 --> 00:31:11.026
Their jaws drop

242
00:31:12.278 --> 00:31:17.783
because they're a bunch of idiots
who get excited over the dumbest things.


243
00:31:28.419 --> 00:31:32.590
Diego is painting two
blocks from our hotel.


244
00:31:42.766 --> 00:31:45.561
I am also painting all the time.

245
00:31:47.855 --> 00:31:52.901
I paint things that are
heavily influenced by Diego.


246
00:31:57.656 --> 00:31:59.992
I've adapted to his style.

247
00:32:00.200 --> 00:32:03.037
I try my best to
make sure it's done well.

248
00:32:08.667 --> 00:32:10.895
She did small paintings with

249
00:32:10.919 --> 00:32:12.880
bright Mexican colors.

250
00:32:12.963 --> 00:32:16.300
But she did not ask
me to look at her work.

251
00:32:16.383 --> 00:32:18.927
She was a little shy about her painting.

252
00:32:20.471 --> 00:32:23.349
She didn't set herself up as an artist.

253
00:32:23.432 --> 00:32:26.935
She was there because
Diego Rivera was starring.


254
00:32:47.206 --> 00:32:50.584
Winter here is incredibly sad.

255
00:32:51.960 --> 00:32:55.422
Everything becomes white suddenly.

256
00:32:55.756 --> 00:32:58.550
But people don't stop going out.

257
00:32:59.927 --> 00:33:02.471
I don't leave this place.

258
00:33:02.680 --> 00:33:05.808
I can't walk much with my crooked spine.

259
00:33:09.269 --> 00:33:11.397
I'm always in pain.

260
00:33:12.231 --> 00:33:15.317
I'm weak and tired.

261
00:33:30.457 --> 00:33:32.251
I spend my days alone

262
00:33:33.001 --> 00:33:36.672
since Diego doesn't stop
painting and painting


263
00:33:37.548 --> 00:33:43.178
and must tend to his affairs.

264
00:33:45.139 --> 00:33:46.432
Diego

265
00:33:47.224 --> 00:33:49.977
I'm alone.

266
00:33:52.855 --> 00:33:55.441
I was never a faithful husband.

267
00:33:56.608 --> 00:33:59.903
I indulged my desires and had affairs.

268
00:34:00.654 --> 00:34:05.617
I often found women too
desirable to resist.


269
00:34:09.371 --> 00:34:15.335
I wanted the freedom to go after
anyone who caught my fancy.


270
00:34:19.715 --> 00:34:22.426
Frida didn't object to my infidelity.

271
00:34:22.885 --> 00:34:29.725
What offended her was when I chose women
unworthy of me or inferior to her.


272
00:34:33.896 --> 00:34:35.790
One time, there was a girl

273
00:34:35.814 --> 00:34:37.733
who was trying to get his attention.

274
00:34:38.901 --> 00:34:42.488
Frida started acting out
little, funny Mexican songs.


275
00:34:48.869 --> 00:34:51.538
She got funnier and funnier.

276
00:34:51.622 --> 00:34:54.625
She was a firework of wit and humor.

277
00:34:55.709 --> 00:34:59.338
Diego then stopped paying attention
to the other girl, as she was a bore.


278
00:35:00.422 --> 00:35:03.884
Frida knew the way
to break that thing up entirely.


279
00:35:18.273 --> 00:35:23.987
It all made me
angry and if I'm being honest, jealous.


280
00:35:26.657 --> 00:35:31.829
Why can't I get it through my head
that the affairs with all these women


281
00:35:32.204 --> 00:35:34.331
the English teachers

282
00:35:34.414 --> 00:35:36.083
the models

283
00:35:36.500 --> 00:35:40.337
and the disciples captivated by your art

284
00:35:40.420 --> 00:35:43.799
are just distractions.

285
00:35:44.800 --> 00:35:49.429
Even though we fight and curse each other

286
00:35:49.513 --> 00:35:56.019
it all makes me realize that
I love you more than my own skin.


287
00:35:56.603 --> 00:35:59.523
And even if you
don't love me the same

288
00:36:00.649 --> 00:36:03.861
you must love me a little bit, right?

289
00:36:22.296 --> 00:36:25.591
Diego's exhibition has been a success.

290
00:36:28.510 --> 00:36:32.681
Two to three thousand people go every day.

291
00:36:36.143 --> 00:36:39.021
Diego's been offered a lot of new work.

292
00:36:39.855 --> 00:36:42.357
So now, we're headed to Detroit.

293
00:36:50.991 --> 00:36:53.785
All I want is to go to Mexico

294
00:36:54.369 --> 00:36:59.333
but Diego has dreams of painting
the steel industry.


295
00:37:09.009 --> 00:37:13.430
Detroit's Art Commission, led by Edsel Ford

296
00:37:13.680 --> 00:37:17.559
invited me to paint murals
at the Detroit Institute of Arts.


297
00:37:19.478 --> 00:37:25.817
It was the largest sum
I had ever been offered to paint walls.


298
00:37:43.585 --> 00:37:45.963
He is in love with the factories

299
00:37:47.130 --> 00:37:49.132
and the machines.

300
00:37:50.676 --> 00:37:54.554
Like a child with a new toy.

301
00:38:05.482 --> 00:38:11.196
Unfortunately, Diego has to work
for these rich jerks.


302
00:38:14.241 --> 00:38:20.122
He tells me that there will be
about three or four months of work here


303
00:38:21.123 --> 00:38:24.334
and then we can return to Mexico.

304
00:38:39.850 --> 00:38:42.477
I'm two months pregnant.

305
00:38:44.062 --> 00:38:46.690
I don't know what to do.

306
00:38:53.488 --> 00:38:57.826
I don't think Diego
wants to have a child.

307
00:38:59.077 --> 00:39:02.414
Diego only cares about painting.

308
00:39:02.956 --> 00:39:06.752
It's more important to him
than anything else in the world.


309
00:39:09.629 --> 00:39:12.299
Secondly, I'm not strong.

310
00:39:14.134 --> 00:39:17.971
The bus accident crushed my bones.

311
00:39:20.390 --> 00:39:23.977
I doubt the baby would be healthy.

312
00:39:29.399 --> 00:39:34.654
Since I still have time to make
the best decision for my health


313
00:39:36.073 --> 00:39:40.160
I think I should have an abortion.

314
00:39:44.956 --> 00:39:51.421
The doctor told me I should keep the baby
instead of aborting it.


315
00:39:55.050 --> 00:40:03.050
Despite my poor health, he thinks I could
have the baby with a cesarean section.


316
00:40:07.813 --> 00:40:13.318
I don't know why the doctor thinks it
would be better for me to have the child.


317
00:40:14.986 --> 00:40:21.868
Since abortion is illegal here
maybe he's afraid.


318
00:40:36.007 --> 00:40:38.635
It's been almost two months.

319
00:40:40.137 --> 00:40:44.182
Now that I think I can
withstand the pregnancy


320
00:40:44.975 --> 00:40:48.228
I'm excited to have the child.

321
00:40:52.357 --> 00:40:55.485
When I arrived there around July 4th,

322
00:40:55.569 --> 00:40:58.530
Frida said, "I'm pregnant."

323
00:40:58.613 --> 00:41:00.407
She was very happy.

324
00:41:03.451 --> 00:41:06.079
It was about 3:00 in the morning.

325
00:41:06.163 --> 00:41:11.001
Diego comes walking in looking disheveled.

326
00:41:11.084 --> 00:41:14.880
He said, "Come quick.
Frida has a hemorrhage."


327
00:41:19.634 --> 00:41:23.346
I rushed into her bedroom,
and she was lying there.


328
00:41:23.430 --> 00:41:27.017
It was just about the deepest
puddle of blood I ever saw.


329
00:41:29.019 --> 00:41:32.731
She looked so tiny, 12 years old.

330
00:41:32.814 --> 00:41:35.192
Her dress is wet with tears.

331
00:41:35.275 --> 00:41:40.197
Out of the pools of blood she had made,
I heard the worst cries of despair.


332
00:41:53.710 --> 00:41:56.796
I miscarried in the blink of an eye.

333
00:41:59.549 --> 00:42:04.387
The fetus didn't form.
It was disintegrated.


334
00:42:06.932 --> 00:42:11.978
Who knows what the hell
is wrong with my body?


335
00:42:16.441 --> 00:42:23.531
I had been so excited to have a
little Diego that I cried so much.


336
00:42:27.786 --> 00:42:30.413
They took me to Ford Hospital.

337
00:42:31.373 --> 00:42:34.501
The doctor didn't tell me what caused it.

338
00:42:34.918 --> 00:42:37.379
I don't know why I miscarried.

339
00:42:41.675 --> 00:42:44.654
She begged
the doctor to let her have a medical book.


340
00:42:44.678 --> 00:42:48.181
She wanted to know exactly
how that fetus looked.


341
00:42:48.265 --> 00:42:51.268
She even wanted to have the real fetus,
and the doctor wouldn't do that.


342
00:42:51.351 --> 00:42:53.645
"I can't give you any books."

343
00:42:53.728 --> 00:42:57.023
And then Diego spoke to the doctor
very seriously and said...


344
00:42:57.107 --> 00:43:01.278
You're not dealing
with an average person here.


345
00:43:01.361 --> 00:43:03.947
She will do something with it.

346
00:43:04.030 --> 00:43:06.616
She will do something in art.

347
00:43:51.411 --> 00:43:55.540
I became obsessed with starting over.

348
00:43:57.083 --> 00:44:00.712
Painting things as I saw them

349
00:44:02.005 --> 00:44:04.341
through no one else's eyes

350
00:44:06.301 --> 00:44:07.927
but my own.

351
00:44:12.682 --> 00:44:15.143
My feelings

352
00:44:15.560 --> 00:44:17.937
my moods

353
00:44:18.355 --> 00:44:23.818
and my profound reactions to life.

354
00:44:54.891 --> 00:44:57.060
The only thing I know

355
00:44:58.603 --> 00:45:01.272
is that I paint because I need to.

356
00:45:09.781 --> 00:45:12.033
How I wish to leave this place.

357
00:45:12.826 --> 00:45:17.831
I want to run and run
until I get to Mexico.


358
00:45:19.916 --> 00:45:22.043
Frida would rather be in Mexico

359
00:45:22.293 --> 00:45:25.505
but I like the United States.

360
00:45:26.256 --> 00:45:28.425
I'm happier here.

361
00:45:33.847 --> 00:45:37.267
Rockefeller Center, a city within a city.

362
00:45:37.350 --> 00:45:41.396
Twelve acres of mighty white buildings
reaching to the sky.


363
00:45:42.772 --> 00:45:49.070
Nelson Rockefeller wanted the best
artists to beautify his new RCA building.


364
00:45:58.746 --> 00:46:03.293
I am completely
disappointed with the famous United States.


365
00:46:06.629 --> 00:46:12.760
Everything here is about appearances
but deep down it's a pile of shit.


366
00:46:15.472 --> 00:46:19.517
I've seen thousands of people
in the most terrible conditions


367
00:46:20.643 --> 00:46:23.229
without anything to eat
and nowhere to sleep.


368
00:46:30.987 --> 00:46:35.492
Rockefeller was fully acquainted
with my communist ideas.


369
00:46:37.994 --> 00:46:41.998
DIEGO RIVERA WITH HIS WIFE AND ASSISTANTS

370
00:46:43.249 --> 00:46:46.127
I was painting a revolutionary mural

371
00:46:46.503 --> 00:46:49.255
with workers marching and singing

372
00:46:51.090 --> 00:46:53.134
and a figure of Lenin.

373
00:46:55.136 --> 00:46:58.598
I was quite aware that I was
going against public opinion.


374
00:47:04.687 --> 00:47:10.193
The private police at Radio City
gave me the order to stop work.


375
00:47:10.610 --> 00:47:14.072
My mural was smashed to pieces.

376
00:47:18.284 --> 00:47:20.036
Stuck-up gringos.

377
00:47:20.203 --> 00:47:23.790
Motherfuckers. 
Sons of bitches.

378
00:47:26.042 --> 00:47:28.628
Because of the conflict with Rockefeller

379
00:47:28.711 --> 00:47:32.632
all my commissions in the United States
were canceled.


380
00:47:52.569 --> 00:47:57.156
Diego blames me for coming back
to godforsaken Mexico


381
00:47:58.866 --> 00:48:03.121
but I know it's not my fault.

382
00:48:07.458 --> 00:48:12.672
He has no desire to work
and gets angry a lot.


383
00:48:15.258 --> 00:48:21.723
It's painful that he thinks I'm to blame.

384
00:48:23.433 --> 00:48:25.786
Mexico is
about the only land that will have him.


385
00:48:25.810 --> 00:48:29.522
So here he is, Trotsky,
landing at Tampico with his wife.


386
00:48:29.606 --> 00:48:31.983
Once Lenin's partner
and commander of the Red Army,


387
00:48:32.066 --> 00:48:33.901
Trotsky finds a refuge.

388
00:48:37.488 --> 00:48:42.452
I was instrumental
in bringing Trotsky to Mexico


389
00:48:42.952 --> 00:48:47.290
after every country in the world
had closed its doors.


390
00:48:48.791 --> 00:48:52.086
I was sick when Trotsky arrived

391
00:48:52.712 --> 00:48:56.674
so I asked Frida to welcome him
and his wife at the dock.


392
00:49:17.236 --> 00:49:19.956
In her relations with Trotsky,

393
00:49:19.989 --> 00:49:23.493
Frida quickly adopted
a certain freedom of manner.


394
00:49:23.576 --> 00:49:25.953
She was very attentive.

395
00:49:27.955 --> 00:49:32.877
Trotsky, who was taken by Frida,
began writing letters to her.


396
00:49:36.964 --> 00:49:41.135
He'd slip a letter into a book
and give the book to her,


397
00:49:41.219 --> 00:49:44.222
often in the presence of others.

398
00:49:44.305 --> 00:49:48.142
Diego had no inkling
of what was going on.

399
00:49:52.397 --> 00:50:00.397
I dedicate this painting to Leon
Trotsky with all my affection.


400
00:50:07.787 --> 00:50:11.082
After
six months, she got bored with the man.


401
00:50:12.208 --> 00:50:15.044
I'm so tired of this old man.

402
00:50:16.671 --> 00:50:20.174
There was
a nine-page letter from Trotsky to Frida


403
00:50:20.258 --> 00:50:22.510
begging her not to break relations

404
00:50:22.593 --> 00:50:27.390
and that life without her
would be very sad and sort of empty.


405
00:50:28.641 --> 00:50:30.518
It was a plea.

406
00:50:30.601 --> 00:50:33.646
The kind of plea
that a young love of the age of 17


407
00:50:33.730 --> 00:50:35.815
would make to somebody he loved.

408
00:50:45.241 --> 00:50:48.411
Frida.

409
00:50:48.494 --> 00:50:51.581
She was
one of the great women of my life.


410
00:50:53.166 --> 00:50:58.087
There is no question that she had
very strong sexual needs.


411
00:50:59.464 --> 00:51:03.009
Once, she told me that
her view of life was...


412
00:51:03.259 --> 00:51:06.846
Make love, take a bath

413
00:51:07.722 --> 00:51:09.849
and make love again.

414
00:51:17.940 --> 00:51:24.363
For me to fall in love
the person has to be sensitive


415
00:51:25.198 --> 00:51:29.827
and above all, I must be
sexually attracted to them.


416
00:51:36.292 --> 00:51:41.005
An affair lasts as long
as it gives pleasure.


417
00:51:41.964 --> 00:51:47.053
It's good to have sex
even if one is not in love.


418
00:51:53.184 --> 00:51:57.522
During sex, my breasts play an active role.

419
00:51:58.564 --> 00:52:01.108
I get excited when they are touched.

420
00:52:06.823 --> 00:52:13.496
Nachito, I would like to spend
more time with you all on our own.


421
00:52:13.788 --> 00:52:17.917
I like you very much, Georgia.

422
00:52:18.751 --> 00:52:21.629
Jacqueline, I have not forgotten you.

423
00:52:21.921 --> 00:52:26.175
The nights are long and punishing.

424
00:52:27.426 --> 00:52:34.892
Bartolí, last night I felt as if wings
caressed my entire body.


425
00:52:34.976 --> 00:52:40.982
As if your fingertips were lips
that kissed my skin.


426
00:52:41.399 --> 00:52:44.402
Oh, my darling Nick.

427
00:52:44.485 --> 00:52:46.195
I adore you.

428
00:52:46.279 --> 00:52:50.575
Believe me, like I never loved anyone.

429
00:53:03.629 --> 00:53:07.049
This painting was done for you.

430
00:53:08.342 --> 00:53:12.013
Remember that I exist in this planet.

431
00:53:14.932 --> 00:53:19.395
Love is the foundation of all life.

432
00:53:36.370 --> 00:53:41.000
Diego approved
of Frida having relationships with women.


433
00:53:42.084 --> 00:53:45.504
One day, he said to me, laughing...

434
00:53:45.588 --> 00:53:49.383
You know Frida is
a homosexual, don't you?


435
00:53:49.467 --> 00:53:52.720
Women are more sensitive.

436
00:53:52.803 --> 00:53:58.809
Therefore, two women together will have
the most extraordinary sexual experience.


437
00:54:02.104 --> 00:54:05.608
Since Diego was
well-known to be a lady chaser,


438
00:54:05.691 --> 00:54:08.611
she could not be blamed
if she saw some men.


439
00:54:08.694 --> 00:54:11.697
It wasn't quite acceptable
to Diego, however.


440
00:54:14.033 --> 00:54:15.910
I was in love with her.

441
00:54:15.993 --> 00:54:18.955
And I used to have assignations with her
here and there.


442
00:54:20.748 --> 00:54:23.042
Diego came by with a gun.

443
00:54:23.125 --> 00:54:25.127
He always carried a gun.

444
00:54:26.212 --> 00:54:28.297
He showed me his gun, and he said,

445
00:54:28.381 --> 00:54:31.592
"Next time I see you,
I'm going to shoot you."


446
00:54:34.804 --> 00:54:36.806
Diego was insanely jealous.

447
00:54:47.692 --> 00:54:53.072
The more I loved
a woman the more I wanted to hurt her.


448
00:54:54.115 --> 00:54:59.453
Frida was the main victim
of this disgusting trait.


449
00:55:01.080 --> 00:55:03.874
I got involved with Frida's best friend

450
00:55:05.209 --> 00:55:08.129
her sister, Cristina.

451
00:55:18.389 --> 00:55:20.307
We were four sisters

452
00:55:20.391 --> 00:55:24.603
but Cristina was the sister
that I loved the most


453
00:55:25.187 --> 00:55:29.316
and who I tried
to help whenever I could.

454
00:55:31.485 --> 00:55:34.864
Cristina is really pretty.

455
00:55:35.531 --> 00:55:38.159
As a child, I
was very jealous of her.

456
00:55:38.367 --> 00:55:40.953
We would fight furiously.

457
00:55:42.079 --> 00:55:44.999
But she was my everything.

458
00:55:52.298 --> 00:55:57.511
I know that right now Diego is more
interested in my sister than me.


459
00:56:01.098 --> 00:56:02.892
It's all a load of crap.

460
00:56:03.559 --> 00:56:05.644
I can't forgive him.

461
00:56:06.937 --> 00:56:08.773
And that is all.

462
00:56:13.152 --> 00:56:14.737
Love

463
00:56:15.613 --> 00:56:17.073
Hate

464
00:56:18.199 --> 00:56:20.242
Madness

465
00:56:33.923 --> 00:56:37.718
I spend my days crying with rage.

466
00:56:38.677 --> 00:56:44.391
I'm just like any other girl
heartbroken by a man leaving her.


467
00:56:45.434 --> 00:56:47.937
I'm worthless.

468
00:56:48.813 --> 00:56:52.066
I can't do anything right.

469
00:56:53.359 --> 00:57:00.950
My situation is so idiotic
that I hate myself for it.


470
00:57:17.383 --> 00:57:21.554
Once Frida found out, she left me.

471
00:57:22.805 --> 00:57:24.682
It was too late.

472
00:57:24.890 --> 00:57:32.731
But if given another chance
I can't say I'd do anything differently.


473
00:57:35.568 --> 00:57:39.196
Every man is a product of his times

474
00:57:39.280 --> 00:57:42.324
and I am what I am.

475
00:57:44.118 --> 00:57:48.622
I wanted to go to New York
but I had no money.


476
00:57:49.290 --> 00:57:52.209
Now I live somewhere else.

477
00:57:53.210 --> 00:57:59.091
Diego drops by once in a while
but we have nothing to say.


478
00:57:59.341 --> 00:58:03.345
There is no connection between us anymore.

479
00:58:04.763 --> 00:58:12.313
He doesn't tell me about his life.
He's not interested in what I do or think.


480
00:58:14.315 --> 00:58:18.194
I loved her too
much to make her suffer.

481
00:58:18.444 --> 00:58:25.075
So to prevent future heartaches
I pleaded with her to give me a divorce.


482
00:58:33.375 --> 00:58:36.670
Today I signed the divorce papers

483
00:58:37.838 --> 00:58:42.009
and I feel lousy
because I truly love him.

484
00:58:45.971 --> 00:58:50.851
But I think this will finally give him
what he wants.


485
00:58:51.936 --> 00:58:59.276
I will no longer be a burden
keeping him from the freedom he demands.


486
00:59:19.380 --> 00:59:22.591
After a few months I forgave my sister

487
00:59:23.425 --> 00:59:29.390
and I'm trying my best
to forget what happened and live.


488
00:59:42.278 --> 00:59:44.905
I'm learning to be alone

489
00:59:45.906 --> 00:59:50.244
and that is a small triumph.

490
00:59:53.622 --> 00:59:58.460
I've wasted my best years
being dependent on a man


491
00:59:58.919 --> 01:00:01.463
without doing anything for myself.

492
01:00:06.927 --> 01:00:10.639
I need to paint so
I can make a living.

493
01:00:11.682 --> 01:00:14.184
Then I will be free.

494
01:00:15.602 --> 01:00:18.981
I no longer accept
a damn cent from Diego.


495
01:00:19.565 --> 01:00:24.486
I will never accept money
from any man until I die.


496
01:00:30.659 --> 01:00:35.789
I paint myself
because I'm what I know best.


497
01:00:41.962 --> 01:00:48.260
My self-portraits are the true expression
of my emotions.


498
01:00:53.015 --> 01:00:58.771
I was told not to
paint so many sad things

499
01:00:59.396 --> 01:01:05.027
but I will paint whatever I want
even if the paintings don't sell.


500
01:01:21.001 --> 01:01:27.758
For the first time in my life
I sold one of my pieces.


501
01:01:31.261 --> 01:01:36.058
I now have a commission to paint
a self-portrait with monkeys.


502
01:01:37.226 --> 01:01:40.896
It seems that everyone wants monkeys.

503
01:01:41.105 --> 01:01:43.357
I don't know why.

504
01:01:58.997 --> 01:02:03.961
The Surrealist poet André Breton
came to Mexico.


505
01:02:07.089 --> 01:02:11.593
On my
arrival in Mexico, my eyes remained closed


506
01:02:11.677 --> 01:02:15.139
to the perfect nobility
and terrible poverty


507
01:02:15.222 --> 01:02:19.601
of the Indian people
in the sun-drenched marketplaces.


508
01:02:26.733 --> 01:02:29.695
I had not yet
set eyes on Frida Kahlo.

509
01:02:29.778 --> 01:02:35.367
Like a fairy-tale princess,
with magic spells at her fingertips.


510
01:02:39.955 --> 01:02:43.959
My surprise was unbounded when I discovered

511
01:02:44.042 --> 01:02:48.714
that her work had blossomed forth
into pure surreality


512
01:02:48.797 --> 01:02:53.886
despite the fact that it had been conceived
without any prior knowledge whatsoever


513
01:02:53.969 --> 01:02:59.266
of the ideas motivating the activities
of my friends and myself.


514
01:03:04.271 --> 01:03:06.815
I never knew I was a Surrealist

515
01:03:07.024 --> 01:03:11.862
until André Breton came to Mexico
and told me I was one.


516
01:03:13.822 --> 01:03:20.454
I must confess I didn't even know
that this art movement existed.


517
01:03:24.833 --> 01:03:29.838
Surrealism is
the omnipotence of dreams.


518
01:03:32.633 --> 01:03:35.636
We are privileged to be present

519
01:03:35.719 --> 01:03:40.641
at the entry of a young woman
endowed with all the gifts of seduction,


520
01:03:40.724 --> 01:03:45.479
one accustomed to the society
of men of genius.


521
01:03:45.562 --> 01:03:50.984
The art of Frida Kahlo
is a ribbon around a bomb.


522
01:04:04.331 --> 01:04:08.085
I adore surprises and the unexpected.

523
01:04:09.127 --> 01:04:11.755
But I never painted my dreams.

524
01:04:12.214 --> 01:04:15.842
I painted my own reality.

525
01:04:30.357 --> 01:04:38.357
Breton was so impressed with my work he
urged me to exhibit in Paris and New York.


526
01:04:53.463 --> 01:05:01.463
A Surrealist gallery in New York
invited me to do a solo exhibition.


527
01:05:03.932 --> 01:05:07.060
I've never had an exhibition before.

528
01:05:10.731 --> 01:05:13.501
The flutter
of the week in Manhattan was caused


529
01:05:13.525 --> 01:05:16.695
by the first exhibition of paintings
by Frida Kahlo.


530
01:05:16.778 --> 01:05:22.284
Little Frida's pictures had the playful
bloody fancy of an unsentimental child.


531
01:05:23.744 --> 01:05:26.622
Everything went wonderfully.

532
01:05:27.122 --> 01:05:31.084
I displayed 25 pieces and sold 12.

533
01:05:35.839 --> 01:05:40.677
From there I went to Paris for an
exhibition organized by André Breton.


534
01:05:55.525 --> 01:06:00.238
Ever since I arrived,
it's been a shit show.


535
01:06:01.281 --> 01:06:04.242
My exhibition wasn't even set up.

536
01:06:04.493 --> 01:06:08.997
My paintings were waiting patiently for me
in customs.


537
01:06:09.289 --> 01:06:14.878
The son-of-a-bitch Breton
hadn't even gone to pick them up.


538
01:06:16.713 --> 01:06:20.509
Now Breton wants to exhibit my paintings

539
01:06:20.842 --> 01:06:24.513
along with common objects
he bought in Mexican markets.


540
01:06:27.557 --> 01:06:29.184
Ordinary crap.

541
01:06:29.726 --> 01:06:31.395
It's all junk.

542
01:06:36.942 --> 01:06:41.488
The exhibition will finally open
at the Pierre Colle gallery.


543
01:06:41.571 --> 01:06:44.908
They say it's one
of the best ones here.

544
01:06:48.412 --> 01:06:52.624
There was quite a crowd at the opening.

545
01:06:54.084 --> 01:06:57.087
Huge congratulations from Joan Miró.

546
01:06:57.629 --> 01:07:00.882
Great praise from Kandinsky.

547
01:07:01.383 --> 01:07:06.763
And congratulations from Picasso
and other big <i>cacas</i> of Surrealism.


548
01:07:08.598 --> 01:07:14.438
But these rich bitches
don't want to buy anything.


549
01:07:16.773 --> 01:07:22.529
I don't have the honor of being
in the elite circle of famous artists.


550
01:07:23.321 --> 01:07:25.449
Men are kings.

551
01:07:25.866 --> 01:07:28.744
They rule the world.

552
01:07:37.043 --> 01:07:41.173
These people make me want to vomit.

553
01:07:42.340 --> 01:07:48.346
They sit in the cafés for hours
warming their precious asses.


554
01:07:48.513 --> 01:07:53.727
They talk endlessly about "culture"
"art" and "revolution."


555
01:07:54.394 --> 01:08:00.358
They poison the air
with theories that never come true.


556
01:08:03.570 --> 01:08:05.822
I hate Surrealism.

557
01:08:07.032 --> 01:08:11.745
It's a decadent manifestation
of bourgeois art.


558
01:08:18.251 --> 01:08:24.800
I am so sick of the whole affair.
To hell with everything.


559
01:08:25.675 --> 01:08:31.306
Fuck everything concerning Breton
and this lousy place.


560
01:08:31.848 --> 01:08:34.226
Let them eat shit.

561
01:08:34.392 --> 01:08:37.771
I am going home.

562
01:08:51.660 --> 01:08:54.246
I feel like hell.

563
01:08:55.455 --> 01:09:00.210
Exhausted by the constant pain in my back
that gets worse every day.


564
01:09:11.346 --> 01:09:16.142
I am fucked because of the accident.

565
01:09:19.813 --> 01:09:22.649
My foot always hurts.

566
01:09:23.942 --> 01:09:30.866
The nerves are damaged
and my foot will never be the same.


567
01:09:32.450 --> 01:09:34.661
It's hopeless.

568
01:09:42.460 --> 01:09:48.466
All the doctors want me
to have an operation.


569
01:09:50.552 --> 01:09:52.846
I'm scared.

570
01:10:02.355 --> 01:10:06.318
In the end, they proceeded to break bones.

571
01:10:07.611 --> 01:10:13.408
They tore off a piece of my pelvis
and fused it to my spine.


572
01:10:24.961 --> 01:10:30.133
The bone will take a long time
to grow and readjust.


573
01:10:31.343 --> 01:10:34.888
I'll have to stay in this hospital
for quite a while.


574
01:10:38.266 --> 01:10:42.020
It is hard to imagine my future.

575
01:10:42.562 --> 01:10:46.650
I can't think about
it until I get well.

576
01:10:49.486 --> 01:10:54.699
Tree of hope, stay strong.

577
01:11:16.346 --> 01:11:20.225
Frida, I haven't known how to say this.

578
01:11:20.725 --> 01:11:26.314
I've never been able to admit
how much I love you


579
01:11:26.940 --> 01:11:29.943
but now I'm sure of it.

580
01:11:31.611 --> 01:11:36.032
Little girl, I'm terribly worried
about your illness.


581
01:11:44.040 --> 01:11:50.296
He tells me I am the woman
he loves above everyone else


582
01:11:50.714 --> 01:11:55.301
and he wants me to marry him again.

583
01:11:58.179 --> 01:12:03.685
I loved her and I
begged her to marry me again


584
01:12:04.060 --> 01:12:06.354
but without success.

585
01:12:06.813 --> 01:12:11.776
When she finally accepted
she did so with conditions.


586
01:12:13.611 --> 01:12:18.742
That she would support herself
with the earnings of her own work.


587
01:12:19.659 --> 01:12:24.330
That I would only pay for half
of our home expenses.


588
01:12:25.123 --> 01:12:27.959
And that we wouldn't
have sex with each other.


589
01:12:29.294 --> 01:12:33.631
When explaining this
last condition, she said


590
01:12:34.424 --> 01:12:41.723
When I imagine you with all your
other women I can't make love to you.


591
01:12:42.265 --> 01:12:49.439
As soon as you start seducing me
I face a psychological barrier.


592
01:12:52.692 --> 01:12:57.572
I felt so happy to have her back
that I accepted all of her conditions.


593
01:12:57.989 --> 01:13:02.285
Frida and I got
married for a second time.

594
01:13:28.269 --> 01:13:30.438
Our second marriage is going well.

595
01:13:32.232 --> 01:13:38.530
There is more mutual understanding.
No more jealousy or violent arguments.


596
01:13:41.741 --> 01:13:46.704
Each spouse does their part
to maintain the home.


597
01:13:49.457 --> 01:13:52.502
We'll be together forever.

598
01:13:54.129 --> 01:13:57.173
Nothing but love between us.

599
01:14:12.397 --> 01:14:14.065
My little boy

600
01:14:14.482 --> 01:14:20.446
I will build you a home
with all of my love.


601
01:14:31.541 --> 01:14:35.211
I'm now teaching at an art school.

602
01:14:42.385 --> 01:14:46.431
And in the afternoons I dedicate myself
to the beauty of painting.


603
01:14:48.600 --> 01:14:55.773
As soon as I finish one I have to sell it to
earn enough money for the monthly expenses.


604
01:14:58.276 --> 01:15:00.653
If it weren't for my health

605
01:15:01.779 --> 01:15:04.616
you could even say that I'm happy.

606
01:15:23.468 --> 01:15:29.015
Up until 1950, 
I was doing well enough.

607
01:15:30.391 --> 01:15:33.561
But now my health is at its worst.

608
01:15:38.483 --> 01:15:42.403
Frida became a professional patient.

609
01:15:43.363 --> 01:15:46.699
She had many surgical interventions

610
01:15:47.075 --> 01:15:50.745
a parade of doctors and orthopedic braces.

611
01:15:51.496 --> 01:15:55.083
They would hang her to
straighten her spine.


612
01:16:02.006 --> 01:16:04.050
This is my reality.

613
01:16:04.550 --> 01:16:06.552
There is no remedy.

614
01:16:07.470 --> 01:16:11.307
Despite it all
nothing is better than laughter.


615
01:16:11.933 --> 01:16:16.104
Laughing hard gives you strength.

616
01:16:18.147 --> 01:16:22.485
At the
hospital, Frida made light of her pain


617
01:16:23.194 --> 01:16:26.114
and swore all the time.

618
01:16:26.781 --> 01:16:29.284
Fucking life.

619
01:16:33.204 --> 01:16:37.041
If she saw me with
a pretty woman, she'd say


620
01:16:37.250 --> 01:16:41.296
Pass her to me. 
I'll take a puff.

621
01:16:46.592 --> 01:16:48.970
I'm always in a cast

622
01:16:49.429 --> 01:16:51.472
but I'm not discouraged.

623
01:16:53.474 --> 01:16:56.644
I have an enormous will to live.

624
01:17:01.607 --> 01:17:04.444
Long live life!

625
01:17:28.634 --> 01:17:32.430
I'm sure they will amputate my right leg.

626
01:17:34.182 --> 01:17:39.187
I don't know the details
but my doctors are concerned.


627
01:17:59.665 --> 01:18:01.334
I'm an invalid.

628
01:18:04.462 --> 01:18:12.462
Now I am trapped
in this fucking house of oblivion.


629
01:18:17.809 --> 01:18:19.685
Yellow

630
01:18:21.020 --> 01:18:22.814
sickness

631
01:18:23.189 --> 01:18:24.941
fear

632
01:18:26.109 --> 01:18:30.780
All the ghosts wear this color.

633
01:18:33.533 --> 01:18:35.785
Red

634
01:18:37.745 --> 01:18:39.747
blood

635
01:18:46.504 --> 01:18:48.881
Black

636
01:18:51.259 --> 01:18:53.177
Nothing is black

637
01:18:55.221 --> 01:18:57.306
truly nothing.

638
01:19:07.150 --> 01:19:09.026
I want to die.

639
01:19:14.949 --> 01:19:18.786
After the operation to amputate her leg

640
01:19:19.245 --> 01:19:21.414
everything was silent.

641
01:19:22.623 --> 01:19:27.587
Not even Diego's presence helped
and she didn't want to paint at all.


642
01:19:28.254 --> 01:19:31.048
The doctor said
not to force her to do anything


643
01:19:31.132 --> 01:19:33.509
because she didn't want to live anymore.

644
01:19:37.597 --> 01:19:41.142
But one morning, she
looked up at me and said


645
01:19:41.893 --> 01:19:43.853
I think I'm going to paint.

646
01:19:45.396 --> 01:19:49.484
I had to bind her to her
wheelchair so she could sit up straight.


647
01:20:02.538 --> 01:20:05.249
In my life I've painted little

648
01:20:06.959 --> 01:20:11.005
without the slightest desire
for glory or ambition


649
01:20:13.341 --> 01:20:18.137
with the sole conviction
to give myself pleasure


650
01:20:20.473 --> 01:20:24.727
and the power to make
a living with my trade.


651
01:20:27.647 --> 01:20:32.902
I've lost so many things
I wanted for my life.


652
01:20:34.487 --> 01:20:38.366
But painting completed my life.

653
01:21:05.476 --> 01:21:12.817
I told Diego it was an outrage that we had
never held an exhibition for Frida in Mexico


654
01:21:13.526 --> 01:21:18.155
and what would he say about
holding one in my gallery.


655
01:21:19.699 --> 01:21:25.621
EXHIBITION OF FRIDA KAHLO'S
BODY OF WORK


656
01:21:33.963 --> 01:21:36.215
She arrived in an ambulance

657
01:21:36.799 --> 01:21:38.884
like a heroine.

658
01:21:41.887 --> 01:21:44.140
Frida sat in the middle of the room.

659
01:21:45.516 --> 01:21:51.522
She was pleased to see so many people
honoring her warmly.


660
01:21:56.068 --> 01:21:58.904
She said almost nothing.

661
01:22:00.573 --> 01:22:06.454
She must have realized
she was bidding life goodbye.


662
01:22:10.207 --> 01:22:12.668
I am not afraid of death.

663
01:22:14.211 --> 01:22:18.090
Even so, I must face the bitter fact

664
01:22:18.591 --> 01:22:22.928
that having many lives
would still not be enough


665
01:22:23.596 --> 01:22:27.767
for me to paint everything I want.

666
01:22:48.371 --> 01:22:50.498
What is joy?

667
01:22:52.083 --> 01:22:55.086
The creation born of discovery.

668
01:23:05.137 --> 01:23:09.934
The lonely deer wandered
very sad and very hurt


669
01:23:11.143 --> 01:23:14.522
until it found warmth and a home.

670
01:23:18.192 --> 01:23:23.114
When the deer returns
strong, happy and healed


671
01:23:24.031 --> 01:23:29.412
the wounds he now bears
will all have been erased.


672
01:23:37.503 --> 01:23:40.089
Thank you for giving me solace.

673
01:23:41.716 --> 01:23:47.138
In the deer's forest,
the sky is now clear.
