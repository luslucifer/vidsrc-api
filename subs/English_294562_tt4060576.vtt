1
00:00:31.213 --> 00:00:34.849
Mr. Zander,
former Green Beret.


2
00:00:37.887 --> 00:00:40.522
Medal of Honor
recipient.


3
00:00:42.191 --> 00:00:45.159
CIA operative.

4
00:00:45.194 --> 00:00:51.165
rmer head
of the Black Cobra
Mercenary Society.


5
00:00:53.369 --> 00:00:56.337
I thought you would have
been a bigger challenge,


6
00:00:56.372 --> 00:00:59.674
but what
a disappointment
you are.


7
00:00:59.708 --> 00:01:03.478
You're beginning
to sound like my father.


8
00:01:05.648 --> 00:01:08.516
Is there anything you
would like to tell us now?


9
00:01:08.551 --> 00:01:10.351
Yeah.

10
00:01:10.386 --> 00:01:13.087
I want to thank you.

11
00:01:13.122 --> 00:01:16.658
You just saved me 1,500 bucks
in a root canal.


12
00:01:18.961 --> 00:01:20.395
Heh.

13
00:01:22.231 --> 00:01:24.032
Joke.

14
00:01:25.367 --> 00:01:27.000
Don't misunderstand me.

15
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.300
I find you very funny,

16
00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:34.810
but I'm done with you
and your jokes.


17
00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:39.540
So tell me, Mr. Zander,

18
00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:42.480
do you have
any final words


19
00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:45.220
before I
remove your head
from your body?


20
00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:49.750
Yeah, I do.

21
00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:55.060
Nice leg.

22
00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:02.000
Aah!
Aah!


23
00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:08.270
<i>Sayonara, amigos.</i>

24
00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:17.080
Cut!

25
00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:18.380
Cut! Cut!

26
00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:19.880
Darren, where are you?
Where are you?


27
00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:21.590
I-Is this how you
take care of me?


28
00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:23.320
It was supposed to be
taken care of.


29
00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:24.420
What happened?

30
00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:25.560
Sorry. It just
malfunctioned.


31
00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:26.660
My bad, baby.
My bad.


32
00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:27.660
Malfunctioned?
My bad.


33
00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:29.260
Wait. This is smoke.

34
00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:30.560
How could smoke
not function?


35
00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:31.700
No. We don't use
smoke anymore.


36
00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:32.930
No, no, no.

37
00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:34.570
No, no.
"Red Rocket" was smoke.


38
00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:36.400
That was whoosh.
This is different.
This is wheesh.


39
00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:37.770
This is
liquid nitrogen,
new formula,


40
00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:39.070
and it's safe
until it explodes.


41
00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:40.870
Nitrogen? Are you kidding me?
Yes.


42
00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:43.170
This is a chemical.
This can't be good
for my body.


43
00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:44.580
Oh, baby,
you look fabulous.


44
00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:46.040
Yeah, man.
You really do
look fabulous.


45
00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:47.440
Let's move on to scene 87.
Sorry, boss.


46
00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:48.850
Let's get
the green screen lit.


47
00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:49.910
Let's get Colton
in his new wardrobe.


48
00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:51.350
87? Hold on.
Wait a minute.


49
00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:52.620
Wait a minute.
Darren, I'm not doing 87.


50
00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:53.880
I'm wrapped.
I can't do this.


51
00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:54.950
We have to do scene 87.
I need you


52
00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:55.950
in the scene
with the bugs.


53
00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:57.450
What bugs? I hate bugs.

54
00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:58.920
I can't do a bug movie.
I'm not doing--


55
00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:00.420
It's so funny
that you say that,


56
00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:02.130
because you're
in a bug movie
right now.


57
00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:03.360
That's what's happening.
I'm in a bug movie?


58
00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:05.400
When did this
become a bug movie?


59
00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:07.130
It became a bug movie when
the writer put his fingers
on the keyboard.


60
00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:08.600
Excuse me. I hope she's
a good friend of yours,


61
00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:09.730
because you
just got her fired.


62
00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:10.870
Hit that
with something heavy.


63
00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:12.300
If I see that
near your face,


64
00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:13.800
your face is in
the unemployment office.


65
00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:15.370
What page is there
a bug movie?


66
00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:16.770
What page?
Did you read the script?


67
00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:18.040
Yeah, I looked it over.

68
00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:19.580
What do you mean
you looked it over?


69
00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:21.880
Did you put it on a coffee table
and look at it,


70
00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:24.280
or did you read it?
I read most of it, Darren.


71
00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:26.080
Come on. We're done here.
We're not done.


72
00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:27.550
We're not done.
Oh, really?


73
00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:29.490
Look, we're into
four hours of overtime,


74
00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:32.890
and you promised me
I could take my kid
to see his favorite team.


75
00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:35.990
You promised me that you
would be a team player
on this shoot,


76
00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:38.760
that I wouldn't have to put up
with your crap this time.


77
00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:40.630
I've been
here for 16 hours
choking on smoke.


78
00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:43.300
How much more
of a team player
do you want?


79
00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:45.000
Don't walk out that door.
Really?


80
00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:46.400
You're making a mistake.
Really?


81
00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:47.400
Thank you, Amber.

82
00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:48.670
Oh, come on. Get bent.

83
00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:50.140
Don't walk out that door,
Colton.


84
00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:51.740
Okay, you did.
Now don't walk to your car.


85
00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:53.580
Really?
Okay, it's over
for you if you do.


86
00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:55.150
Over? Come on.
Yeah.


87
00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:56.810
We know each other

88
00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:58.520
10 years is nothing
in this business.


89
00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:00.180
I'm done with you.
Oh, come on.


90
00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:02.090
Look, Darren, you know
the only reason


91
00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:03.590
the producers
put me in this


92
00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:05.590
is to put my face
on the video box.


93
00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:08.430
On a video box?
Did you just time-travel here
from the nineties?


94
00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:10.090
This is your problem.

95
00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:12.130
You live in a world
of car phones and
fax machines.


96
00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:13.260
You're living in the past.

97
00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:14.600
"Red Rocket"
was 20 years ago.


98
00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:16.630
"Clown Cops"
was 25 years ago.


99
00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:19.500
You have to realize
I only put you in this move
as a favor to Arni.


100
00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:21.440
I'm making a movie about
giant cockroaches, okay?


101
00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:23.770
It sells itself.
It doesn't need this,
not anymore.


102
00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:25.810
Look, you don't
have to say that.
That's not really nice.


103
00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:27.040
We're friends. Come on.

104
00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:28.380
Not anymore.
I'm done with you.


105
00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:29.710
Come on, Darren.

106
00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:31.720
I'm gonna see you
tomorrow morning.


107
00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:34.020
Not unless I'm down
at the unemployment
office, you won't.


108
00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:35.190
Okay, bye, Colton.

109
00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:38.160
Meg, get Arni
on the phone.


110
00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:48.730
A recent swarm of earthquakes

111
00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:51.240
has been rocking
Southern California.


112
00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:53.300
Dr. Deckert Serbi is here
to talk about what is happening.


113
00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:56.740
Thank you for spending some time
with us today, Doctor.


114
00:04:56.780 --> 00:04:57.740
This is Colton.

115
00:04:57.780 --> 00:04:59.210
You walked off the set?

116
00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:00.680
Are you kidding me
right now?


117
00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:02.180
Are you kidding me,
Arni?


118
00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:03.710
It's a freaking
cockroach movie.


119
00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:05.580
He didn't read the script.

120
00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:07.990
It's what's
being offered.


121
00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:10.520
It's $10,000
for one day's work,


122
00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:12.520
and I had to beg
to get it for you!


123
00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:14.990
Well, you know what?
They can keep
the money, okay?


124
00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:17.490
You know, I'm looking
for something with
integrity and respect.


125
00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:19.700
Do you know that word,
Arni? "Respect."


126
00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:21.770
You know, I'm better
than this crap.


127
00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:22.770
No, you're not.

128
00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:25.000
I promised them--

129
00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:28.110
No, I swore to them
you would be a mensch!


130
00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:30.440
Nobody is more menschy
than me. You know that.


131
00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:33.240
Look, I just
bailed you out of jail.


132
00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:37.080
You were five seconds
away from orange is
the new ass in town.


133
00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:40.250
They kept me four hours
after my day, okay?


134
00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:41.350
I don't care!

135
00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:43.020
You owe me money, Colt!

136
00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:45.920
Just turn your car
around, please,
and go to work!


137
00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:48.060
Arni, I got another call.

138
00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:49.290
No more bug movies.

139
00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:51.060
Don't you hang up on me!

140
00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:52.700
Don't! Don't!

141
00:05:52.730 --> 00:05:54.630
Mother-
-Maggie!

142
00:05:54.670 --> 00:05:56.230
Hi, honey.

143
00:05:56.270 --> 00:05:58.070
Where the hell
are you?


144
00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:00.470
It's nice to hear
your voice, too, sweetheart.


145
00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:02.870
The game starts
in 20 minutes.


146
00:06:02.910 --> 00:06:04.410
Did you forget?

147
00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:06.880
No. Honey,
this is Los Angeles.


148
00:06:06.910 --> 00:06:08.280
Nobody gets to a game
before the fourth inning.


149
00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:10.110
You know that.

150
00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:11.780
Whatever.
I'm out of here.


151
00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:14.750
Uh, he's on--
he's on his way, sweetheart.


152
00:06:14.790 --> 00:06:17.420
I've heard it before.

153
00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:19.060
Wyatt.

154
00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:23.390
Great. He just walked
out of the house.


155
00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:25.230
What's with that kid?

156
00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:26.630
He doesn't listen
anymore.


157
00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:28.770
Tell him the freeway's
a parking lot.


158
00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:31.070
I'm gonna get there
as soon as I can.


159
00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:33.500
You know what?
You tell him.


160
00:06:33.540 --> 00:06:35.840
Colton West is
in the news again.


161
00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:37.170
Why are you
on TV?


162
00:06:37.210 --> 00:06:39.680
According to
law enforcement sources,


163
00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:43.180
nineties movie star and
action hero Colton West


164
00:06:43.210 --> 00:06:45.520
was booked last night
in Santa Monica


165
00:06:45.550 --> 00:06:48.590
on charges of aggravated assault
and resisting arrest.


166
00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:52.090
I guess that's one way to get
yourself back in the public eye.


167
00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:53.920
What kind of trouble
are you in now?


168
00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:56.190
I don't know, honey.
I really don't know.


169
00:06:56.230 --> 00:06:58.030
You know what?
I don't care.


170
00:06:58.060 --> 00:06:59.300
Goodbye, Colton.

171
00:07:01.230 --> 00:07:02.300
Whoa.
Did you feel that?


172
00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:03.700
Whoa!

173
00:07:03.740 --> 00:07:05.600
We're having an earthquake.

174
00:07:05.640 --> 00:07:07.440
Yeah, honey,
are you okay?


175
00:07:07.470 --> 00:07:09.310
Olivia, are you okay?

176
00:07:14.250 --> 00:07:16.510
Whoa!
You see that?!


177
00:07:27.030 --> 00:07:29.030
Everybody
take cover!


178
00:08:01.690 --> 00:08:03.730
Aah!

179
00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:13.040
Come on.

180
00:08:13.070 --> 00:08:14.870
Come on. Come on.

181
00:08:34.290 --> 00:08:35.690
Come on, answer.

182
00:08:35.730 --> 00:08:37.030
Answer.

183
00:08:38.830 --> 00:08:41.430
Reports are pouring in
of an unprecedented


184
00:08:41.470 --> 00:08:43.730
geological event
occurring in Los Angeles.


185
00:08:43.770 --> 00:08:45.440
How 'bout biological?

186
00:08:45.470 --> 00:08:47.700
How 'bout volcanic,
you moron?


187
00:08:47.740 --> 00:08:50.110
This is
a freaking apocalypse!


188
00:08:55.250 --> 00:08:57.580
In a follow-up story,
the Malibu bar fight


189
00:08:57.620 --> 00:09:00.780
involving nineties movie star
and action hero, Colton West,


190
00:09:00.820 --> 00:09:04.050
who was made famous
by his role as the Red Rocket


191
00:09:04.090 --> 00:09:07.660
and made famous the expression,
"Nice" anything.


192
00:09:07.690 --> 00:09:09.590
Nice nose.

193
00:09:09.630 --> 00:09:10.590
Nice tattoo. Yah!

194
00:09:13.130 --> 00:09:15.930
Nice tentacle.

195
00:09:15.970 --> 00:09:17.300
Eyewitnesses are now
coming forward


196
00:09:17.340 --> 00:09:19.600
to say that Colton West
was in fact


197
00:09:19.640 --> 00:09:21.170
trying to be a peacemaker.

198
00:09:21.210 --> 00:09:23.440
If that in fact is the case,

199
00:09:23.470 --> 00:09:25.580
then this reporter
has one thing to say.


200
00:09:25.610 --> 00:09:27.280
Nice job.

201
00:09:27.310 --> 00:09:30.250
We interrupt this program
to bring you breaking news.


202
00:09:30.280 --> 00:09:32.020
The earthquakes
that have been shaking


203
00:09:32.050 --> 00:09:34.020
the L.A. basin
the last few minutes


204
00:09:34.050 --> 00:09:36.520
are in fact tied
to a volcanic eruption


205
00:09:36.550 --> 00:09:40.660
in the Santa Monica Mountains
near the Sepulveda Pass.


206
00:09:40.690 --> 00:09:42.090
Now, this would be

207
00:09:42.130 --> 00:09:45.660
an unprecedented volcanic event
that--Okay.


208
00:09:57.640 --> 00:10:00.040
Why is there
still no Internet?


209
00:10:01.080 --> 00:10:02.280
Damn it!

210
00:10:02.310 --> 00:10:04.210
You get Colton
on the phone yet?


211
00:10:04.250 --> 00:10:06.050
No. It keeps going
to voice mail.


212
00:10:06.080 --> 00:10:08.220
You guys
have to see this.


213
00:10:08.250 --> 00:10:10.820
One of my friends
just sent this to me.


214
00:10:15.530 --> 00:10:17.230
Yeah, that's great.

215
00:10:17.260 --> 00:10:19.130
My kid has
that app, too.


216
00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:20.330
Take a video
of anything,


217
00:10:20.360 --> 00:10:21.800
you can nuke it,
alien invade it,


218
00:10:21.830 --> 00:10:23.570
smash it
with a meteor.
What?


219
00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:25.200
He's already killed
the neighbor's cat

220
00:10:25.240 --> 00:10:26.800
Oh, my God!

221
00:10:26.840 --> 00:10:28.210
That was a big one,
you guys.


222
00:10:28.240 --> 00:10:29.540
I think
we should go home.


223
00:10:29.570 --> 00:10:30.540
I think
you're right.


224
00:10:30.580 --> 00:10:32.310
That's a first.

225
00:10:32.340 --> 00:10:33.810
Now!

226
00:10:33.850 --> 00:10:36.080
Okay.

227
00:10:36.110 --> 00:10:37.880
Son of a--

228
00:10:46.360 --> 00:10:47.760
Spiders.
Did the spiders come?


229
00:10:47.790 --> 00:10:49.330
Have you seen
the spiders?


230
00:10:49.360 --> 00:10:50.730
Why didn't you tell me
about the bar fight?


231
00:10:50.760 --> 00:10:52.500
The bar--bar fight
was nothing!


232
00:10:52.530 --> 00:10:53.530
Nothing?
What--


233
00:10:53.560 --> 00:10:54.930
It's all over the news.

234
00:10:54.970 --> 00:10:56.400
"Colton West
is in trouble again."


235
00:10:56.430 --> 00:10:57.730
Did Arni bail you out?

236
00:10:57.770 --> 00:10:59.070
None of that matters.
Nothing matters.


237
00:10:59.100 --> 00:11:01.200
What matters
is you're okay.


238
00:11:01.240 --> 00:11:02.870
Thank God, honey,
you're okay.


239
00:11:02.910 --> 00:11:04.770
You're not gonna believe
what I saw.


240
00:11:04.810 --> 00:11:06.780
You're not gonna believe
what's going on
on the freeway.


241
00:11:06.810 --> 00:11:07.780
Where's Wyatt?

242
00:11:07.810 --> 00:11:09.210
He left, remember?

243
00:11:09.250 --> 00:11:10.550
When did he do that?

244
00:11:10.580 --> 00:11:11.880
Of course you
don't remember. He--


245
00:11:11.920 --> 00:11:13.620
You forgot to pick
him up for his game,


246
00:11:13.650 --> 00:11:15.250
so he just walked
out of the house.


247
00:11:15.290 --> 00:11:16.720
Honey, have you seen
the news?


248
00:11:16.750 --> 00:11:18.720
Yes! You had a bar fight.

249
00:11:18.760 --> 00:11:21.260
Call Wyatt,
and get him back here.


250
00:11:21.290 --> 00:11:23.690
I have been
calling Wyatt,


251
00:11:23.730 --> 00:11:26.130
but of course
he's not picking up.


252
00:11:28.730 --> 00:11:32.070
You know what?
I'm just gonna go teach
my kickboxing class.


253
00:11:32.100 --> 00:11:33.540
You're not
teaching anything.


254
00:11:33.570 --> 00:11:34.770
You're not going anywhere.

255
00:11:34.810 --> 00:11:36.070
Honey, it's not safe
out there.


256
00:11:36.110 --> 00:11:37.240
I don't want you
going anywhere.


257
00:11:37.280 --> 00:11:38.810
Stop it.
You're scaring me.


258
00:11:38.840 --> 00:11:40.580
All right, I'm sorry!
What do you want from me?


259
00:11:40.610 --> 00:11:42.650
I want you
to talk to me like
a normal human being.


260
00:11:42.680 --> 00:11:43.750
Okay. Okay. Sweetheart,

261
00:11:43.780 --> 00:11:45.420
did you feel
the earthquake?


262
00:11:45.450 --> 00:11:46.480
Yes.

263
00:11:46.520 --> 00:11:47.480
Good! Good!

264
00:11:47.520 --> 00:11:48.650
I felt the earthquake.

265
00:11:48.690 --> 00:11:50.120
It was an earthquake.
Right.


266
00:11:50.150 --> 00:11:51.760
The fifth one this year.

267
00:11:51.790 --> 00:11:53.790
It's not like it's
the end of the world.


268
00:11:53.820 --> 00:11:55.730
Yes, it is, believe me.
The Santa Monica Mountains


269
00:11:55.760 --> 00:11:58.090
erupted like a volcano.
I was on the freeway,


270
00:11:58.130 --> 00:12:00.560
and I saw spiders
the size of men


271
00:12:00.600 --> 00:12:03.070
raining on hoods
and spitting fire out
of their mouths.


272
00:12:03.100 --> 00:12:04.300
Fire out of their mouths.

273
00:12:04.340 --> 00:12:06.100
Have you
been drinking again?


274
00:12:06.140 --> 00:12:07.740
No.
You know what?


275
00:12:07.770 --> 00:12:09.270
That's it.
I'm calling
Dr. Hertzberg.


276
00:12:09.310 --> 00:12:10.670
Honey, wait.
No, no, no. Stop it.


277
00:12:10.710 --> 00:12:12.140
In the car now.
Honey, stop it.


278
00:12:12.180 --> 00:12:14.240
I am not on anything.
I am completely sober.


279
00:12:14.280 --> 00:12:15.750
I need you
to listen to me.


280
00:12:15.780 --> 00:12:17.010
Sweetheart,
listen to me.


281
00:12:17.050 --> 00:12:19.080
I love you, okay?
I need you to pack


282
00:12:19.120 --> 00:12:20.150
everything that's
important to us.


283
00:12:20.180 --> 00:12:21.590
I want you to take the dog,

284
00:12:21.620 --> 00:12:22.950
I want you take
your jewelry,


285
00:12:22.990 --> 00:12:24.820
and I want you
to pack everything up,


286
00:12:24.860 --> 00:12:27.490
and you have to listen to me,
and we have to leave here.


287
00:12:29.960 --> 00:12:32.860
Colton,
we don't have a dog.


288
00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.530
Colton! Colton!

289
00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.370
Whoa, whoa. Wait, wait.
What is that for?


290
00:12:40.400 --> 00:12:43.170
I'm going to get Wyatt.
Honey, did you call him or not?


291
00:12:43.210 --> 00:12:45.510
Okay, okay.
I was standing here,
talking to you.


292
00:12:45.540 --> 00:12:47.340
He said he was
going to Travis'.


293
00:12:47.380 --> 00:12:49.710
Oh, damn. Then he's probably
downtown riding bikes.


294
00:12:49.750 --> 00:12:51.480
Look, just stay
in the house.


295
00:12:51.520 --> 00:12:53.850
If he comes back,
you keep him here.
You got it?


296
00:12:53.880 --> 00:12:55.550
Circuits are busy.

297
00:12:55.590 --> 00:12:56.990
Well, just keep trying.

298
00:12:57.020 --> 00:12:59.490
And tell everybody
to stay off the freeway.


299
00:13:25.750 --> 00:13:26.820
All right, get this.
Get this.


300
00:13:26.850 --> 00:13:27.850
Here he goes.
Here he goes.


301
00:13:30.290 --> 00:13:32.490
Whoo!

302
00:13:32.520 --> 00:13:34.760
Ah, wicked, man!

303
00:13:34.790 --> 00:13:37.160
Hey, dawg. I didn't
know you were coming.


304
00:13:37.190 --> 00:13:38.700
Glad you could
make it out.


305
00:13:38.730 --> 00:13:39.930
Hey, Jordan.
Sick move, man.


306
00:13:39.960 --> 00:13:41.260
Thanks.
Yeah.


307
00:13:41.300 --> 00:13:42.830
Should have been here
five minutes ago.


308
00:13:42.870 --> 00:13:44.430
Yeah. You should've seen.
My girl was sick.


309
00:13:44.470 --> 00:13:45.940
So are you
riding with us today?


310
00:13:45.970 --> 00:13:47.740
Yeah, for sure, if it's
cool with you guys.


311
00:13:47.770 --> 00:13:49.210
Of course.
Hell, yeah.


312
00:13:49.240 --> 00:13:50.710
Oh, right on. Let's go.

313
00:13:52.380 --> 00:13:54.440
Don't even think
about it.


314
00:13:54.480 --> 00:13:56.850
I've been trying forever
to get her out here.


315
00:13:56.880 --> 00:13:57.850
What did I do?

316
00:13:57.880 --> 00:13:59.550
Gave her a flirty smile.

317
00:14:00.580 --> 00:14:01.850
I did?
Yeah.


318
00:14:01.890 --> 00:14:03.250
Oh, okay. Well, um,
Eli's the one


319
00:14:03.290 --> 00:14:04.620
riding with her
right now,


320
00:14:04.660 --> 00:14:05.920
so you might wanna
go jump in on that.


321
00:14:05.960 --> 00:14:08.430
Dude, I don't care
about Eli.


322
00:14:08.460 --> 00:14:09.790
Don't mess this up
for me, man.


323
00:14:09.830 --> 00:14:12.260
Dude, relax.
It's--It's good.


324
00:14:12.300 --> 00:14:14.030
Come on. Let's just--
Come on. Let's ride.


325
00:14:14.070 --> 00:14:15.200
Whoa!

326
00:14:15.230 --> 00:14:16.700
Dude.

327
00:14:16.730 --> 00:14:17.730
What just happened?

328
00:14:19.670 --> 00:14:22.410
Whoa, did you guys
see that?


329
00:14:25.740 --> 00:14:26.980
That was big.

330
00:14:27.010 --> 00:14:29.250
Yeah. Let's check it out.

331
00:14:33.250 --> 00:14:34.780
Are you coming?

332
00:14:34.820 --> 00:14:36.650
What? Um...

333
00:14:36.690 --> 00:14:38.820
yeah. Yeah.

334
00:14:44.030 --> 00:14:46.160
Hey, it's Wyatt.
I'm not here right now.


335
00:14:46.200 --> 00:14:47.830
Leave a message.
Damn it.


336
00:14:51.840 --> 00:14:54.670
Damn. Oh. What the--

337
00:14:59.940 --> 00:15:00.940
What the...

338
00:15:12.320 --> 00:15:15.560
Are you kidding me?

339
00:15:21.800 --> 00:15:24.070
My God!

340
00:15:41.420 --> 00:15:42.550
Hello.

341
00:15:42.590 --> 00:15:44.220
Hey, Doris.
It's Olivia.


342
00:15:44.260 --> 00:15:46.560
You're checking up
on me, aren't you?


343
00:15:46.590 --> 00:15:47.960
I'm fine, darling.

344
00:15:47.990 --> 00:15:49.960
40 years here,
and I swear


345
00:15:49.990 --> 00:15:52.400
I'll never get used
to these earthquakes.


346
00:15:52.430 --> 00:15:53.800
I know, right?

347
00:15:53.830 --> 00:15:55.500
Hey, listen, is your power
out over there?


348
00:15:55.530 --> 00:15:56.830
Yeah,
couple minutes ago.


349
00:15:56.870 --> 00:15:58.500
Must be
the whole neighborhood.


350
00:15:58.540 --> 00:15:59.500
You need candles?

351
00:15:59.540 --> 00:16:00.570
No, no, no, I'm good.

352
00:16:00.600 --> 00:16:02.070
You okay?
I don't know.


353
00:16:02.110 --> 00:16:04.070
Colton was just here,
and he was ranting


354
00:16:04.110 --> 00:16:07.710
about some kind of
a disaster, and it actually
shook me up a little.


355
00:16:07.750 --> 00:16:09.050
Earthquakes, fires,

356
00:16:09.080 --> 00:16:10.750
rolling blackouts,
mudslides,


357
00:16:10.780 --> 00:16:12.420
the Governator.
We're Californians.


358
00:16:12.450 --> 00:16:13.750
We've been
through worse.


359
00:16:13.780 --> 00:16:15.190
Yeah, I guess.

360
00:16:15.220 --> 00:16:16.390
Is he still home?

361
00:16:16.420 --> 00:16:18.520
No, no. He went
to go get Wyatt.


362
00:16:18.560 --> 00:16:20.390
They're gonna be back
in little bit.


363
00:16:22.290 --> 00:16:23.530
What now?

364
00:16:23.560 --> 00:16:25.730
Olivia, can you
hold on a second?


365
00:16:25.760 --> 00:16:27.700
Coco's barking.
I need to see
what's going on.


366
00:16:27.730 --> 00:16:28.730
Yeah, sure.

367
00:16:34.610 --> 00:16:36.110
Coco.

368
00:16:38.280 --> 00:16:40.340
Coco!

369
00:16:40.380 --> 00:16:42.280
Where are you?

370
00:16:55.660 --> 00:16:58.800
Coco, where are you?

371
00:16:58.830 --> 00:17:01.000
Where have you gone?

372
00:17:07.510 --> 00:17:09.410
Why--

373
00:17:17.650 --> 00:17:20.080
Doris?

374
00:17:20.120 --> 00:17:21.280
Doris!

375
00:17:24.720 --> 00:17:26.760
Whoa.

376
00:17:26.790 --> 00:17:28.390
Hold on.
Whoa, look at that.


377
00:17:28.430 --> 00:17:29.690
Wow.
Whoa, guys.


378
00:17:29.730 --> 00:17:31.460
Hold up. Hold up.
Hold up.


379
00:17:31.500 --> 00:17:33.960
Oh, man.

380
00:17:38.470 --> 00:17:40.270
What do you think
happened here?


381
00:17:40.310 --> 00:17:42.110
The ground just started
breaking up.


382
00:17:42.140 --> 00:17:43.810
Looks like
a bomb hit.


383
00:17:43.840 --> 00:17:46.240
What?

384
00:17:51.780 --> 00:17:54.890
Hold up.
You smell that?


385
00:17:54.920 --> 00:17:56.450
That smells
like gas.


386
00:17:56.490 --> 00:17:58.420
Guys, let's get
out of here.


387
00:17:58.460 --> 00:18:00.160
Yeah, I'm with Wyatt.
Come on.


388
00:18:04.430 --> 00:18:06.360
Go! Go!

389
00:18:08.870 --> 00:18:11.100
Wyatt! Wyatt!

390
00:18:11.140 --> 00:18:13.270
Jordan, hold on!

391
00:18:14.710 --> 00:18:16.910
Come on! Come on!

392
00:18:16.940 --> 00:18:18.780
Something bit me.
Can you ride?


393
00:18:18.810 --> 00:18:20.140
Go!

394
00:18:20.180 --> 00:18:21.680
Go! Go!

395
00:18:21.710 --> 00:18:22.780
Go! Go! Go!

396
00:18:22.810 --> 00:18:24.350
Come on.

397
00:18:35.160 --> 00:18:36.130
Yo!

398
00:18:36.160 --> 00:18:37.530
Yo, stop!

399
00:18:37.560 --> 00:18:40.300
Yo! Yo! Yo!

400
00:18:40.330 --> 00:18:41.430
Stop!

401
00:18:41.470 --> 00:18:42.770
Stop! Stop! Stop!

402
00:18:42.800 --> 00:18:44.170
Please stop!

403
00:18:57.320 --> 00:18:59.720
What the heck
is that guy doing there?


404
00:18:59.750 --> 00:19:01.020
Hey!
Oh, my God.


405
00:19:01.050 --> 00:19:02.320
Hey! Hey, hey!

406
00:19:02.350 --> 00:19:03.320
Everyone...
Hey, stop!


407
00:19:03.360 --> 00:19:04.890
Stop! Hey!

408
00:19:04.920 --> 00:19:08.190
It's the Red Rocket
himself, Colton West!


409
00:19:08.230 --> 00:19:09.490
Hey!

410
00:19:09.530 --> 00:19:11.500
Look, look, no time
for a tour, okay?


411
00:19:11.530 --> 00:19:13.200
Did you not see
the volcano?


412
00:19:13.230 --> 00:19:14.870
There's a catastrophe
going on.


413
00:19:14.900 --> 00:19:16.700
No, no,
it's just a little
earthquake, Colton.


414
00:19:16.740 --> 00:19:18.400
No. No. It's not
a little earthquake, man.


415
00:19:18.440 --> 00:19:20.040
You guys
are in a lot of trouble.


416
00:19:20.070 --> 00:19:20.870
You gotta get out of here.

417
00:19:20.870 --> 00:19:22.610
You gotta get these people
to a safe place.


418
00:19:22.640 --> 00:19:23.610
Look, what's your name?

419
00:19:23.640 --> 00:19:24.610
Joe.
Joe?


420
00:19:24.640 --> 00:19:25.910
Okay, Joe. Joe, I need--

421
00:19:25.950 --> 00:19:28.080
Joe, I need
your focus on me, okay?


422
00:19:28.110 --> 00:19:30.010
Joe, I need to get
downtown to get my son.


423
00:19:30.850 --> 00:19:31.850
Can you help me?

424
00:19:31.880 --> 00:19:33.080
But just first,
just get


425
00:19:33.120 --> 00:19:34.650
a quick little selfie.
Do you mind?


426
00:19:34.690 --> 00:19:35.920
No, Joe, we don't
have time for pictures.


427
00:19:35.950 --> 00:19:37.320
My wife would
just love this.


428
00:19:37.360 --> 00:19:38.990
Joe, just please--
just take me downtown.


429
00:19:39.020 --> 00:19:40.660
No, wait! Right.
No, no. No, better!


430
00:19:40.690 --> 00:19:41.860
You and the bus.

431
00:19:41.890 --> 00:19:43.190
It would be,
like, awesome PR,


432
00:19:43.230 --> 00:19:44.660
just right there
in front of the bus.


433
00:19:44.700 --> 00:19:46.400
Great, Joe.

434
00:19:46.430 --> 00:19:47.600
Joe, a shot right here,
right?


435
00:19:47.630 --> 00:19:49.030
Oh, you look nice.

436
00:19:49.070 --> 00:19:50.670
Need to move back
a little bit, Joe.


437
00:19:50.700 --> 00:19:51.900
Okay, okay, okay.
Move back a little bit, Joe.


438
00:19:51.940 --> 00:19:53.170
Okay, just keep moving back.
Okay.


439
00:19:53.200 --> 00:19:54.570
Yeah, keep moving back.
I got it.


440
00:19:54.610 --> 00:19:56.040
Yeah, yeah.
It's called a wide shot.


441
00:19:56.070 --> 00:19:57.240
A wide shot?
Wide shot, Joe.


442
00:19:57.280 --> 00:19:58.910
Yeah, yeah. Movie talk, Joe.
Okay.


443
00:19:58.940 --> 00:20:00.610
Movie talk. You're gonna
be making a movie with me.


444
00:20:00.650 --> 00:20:01.850
I'm making a movie
with Colton West.


445
00:20:01.880 --> 00:20:03.050
And then
you know what, Joe?


446
00:20:03.080 --> 00:20:04.380
Another movie talk
is camera left.


447
00:20:04.420 --> 00:20:05.620
That way. Exactly, Joe.

448
00:20:05.650 --> 00:20:06.780
Yeah. Yeah.
Okay, so...


449
00:20:06.820 --> 00:20:07.920
Yeah. Turn that way,
and look...


450
00:20:07.950 --> 00:20:09.250
Turn?
towards the trees, Joe.


451
00:20:09.290 --> 00:20:10.390
Aim the camera that way?
That's it.


452
00:20:10.420 --> 00:20:11.890
Okay.
Aim toward--You know,


453
00:20:11.920 --> 00:20:13.420
I'm gonna say, "Action,"
Joe, like a movie.


454
00:20:13.460 --> 00:20:14.630
We're making
a great movie, Joe.


455
00:20:14.660 --> 00:20:15.890
Okay.
This is just so awesome.


456
00:20:15.930 --> 00:20:17.260
I mean, I'm such
a big fan of...


457
00:20:17.300 --> 00:20:19.060
And don't move
until I say, "Action."


458
00:20:19.100 --> 00:20:20.200
The second one
not so much,


459
00:20:20.230 --> 00:20:21.200
but the first one was--

460
00:20:21.230 --> 00:20:22.530
Action!
Hey!


461
00:20:22.570 --> 00:20:23.570
Hey!

462
00:20:23.600 --> 00:20:25.200
My bus! Ahh!

463
00:20:25.240 --> 00:20:28.110
Colton West took my bus!

464
00:20:32.610 --> 00:20:34.080
Thank you very much.

465
00:20:34.110 --> 00:20:36.750
I apologize
for taking control
of your bus,


466
00:20:36.780 --> 00:20:39.250
but as you may
or may not know,


467
00:20:39.280 --> 00:20:41.420
there was an earthquake
today in Los Angeles


468
00:20:41.450 --> 00:20:43.990
that was caused
by some sort of
volcanic activity


469
00:20:44.020 --> 00:20:45.660
in the Santa Monica
Mountains.


470
00:20:45.690 --> 00:20:49.590
Lava spiders erupted
from these mountains,
spiders,


471
00:20:49.630 --> 00:20:51.630
spiders as big as men,

472
00:20:51.660 --> 00:20:55.130
and they rained down
on all of Los Angeles.


473
00:20:55.170 --> 00:20:56.630
Colton,<i>banzai!</i>

474
00:21:00.670 --> 00:21:01.670
Thanks, kid.

475
00:21:01.710 --> 00:21:03.340
<i>Banzai</i> to you, too.

476
00:21:12.650 --> 00:21:14.020
This way!

477
00:21:16.020 --> 00:21:17.650
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

478
00:21:23.390 --> 00:21:24.700
Follow me. Come on.

479
00:21:24.730 --> 00:21:25.730
Go! Go!

480
00:21:27.530 --> 00:21:28.970
Hurry up! Come on!

481
00:21:30.800 --> 00:21:32.000
Eli!

482
00:21:32.040 --> 00:21:34.000
I'm coming! I'm com--
Eli!


483
00:21:36.510 --> 00:21:38.110
Eli, no!

484
00:21:38.140 --> 00:21:39.680
Eli!

485
00:21:39.710 --> 00:21:40.680
Eli, no!

486
00:21:40.710 --> 00:21:42.480
Wyatt, let's go!

487
00:21:46.920 --> 00:21:47.990
Aah! Aah!

488
00:21:48.020 --> 00:21:49.020
What?!
What the hell!


489
00:21:50.020 --> 00:21:51.390
Travis!
Travis, here!


490
00:21:51.420 --> 00:21:52.660
Come here.
Come here.


491
00:21:56.190 --> 00:21:57.160
Let me...

492
00:21:58.330 --> 00:22:00.030
Jordan! Jordan!

493
00:22:00.060 --> 00:22:01.030
Dude, don't leave me.

494
00:22:01.070 --> 00:22:02.130
I'm right here!

495
00:22:02.170 --> 00:22:03.700
Don't touch it.

496
00:22:03.740 --> 00:22:06.370
Just get me
out of here, okay?


497
00:22:07.940 --> 00:22:09.970
Did you see what
those things did to Eli?


498
00:22:10.010 --> 00:22:11.580
What the hell
are those things?


499
00:22:11.610 --> 00:22:13.180
I don't know, man.

500
00:22:13.210 --> 00:22:14.810
It bit me.

501
00:22:14.850 --> 00:22:15.810
It bit you?

502
00:22:15.850 --> 00:22:16.910
What bit you?

503
00:22:16.950 --> 00:22:19.350
I said I don't know, man!

504
00:22:19.380 --> 00:22:21.890
Okay, listen.
Just stay here for a second.


505
00:22:21.920 --> 00:22:23.990
Okay. You watch her.
Hey, can you do that?


506
00:22:24.020 --> 00:22:25.260
Okay, I'm gonna get
the first-aid kit.


507
00:22:25.290 --> 00:22:26.920
Okay.

508
00:22:28.560 --> 00:22:30.960
I'm burnt so bad.

509
00:22:36.470 --> 00:22:38.100
Doris, are you in there?

510
00:22:38.140 --> 00:22:39.540
It's Olivia.

511
00:22:40.610 --> 00:22:41.970
Doris, are...

512
00:22:47.250 --> 00:22:48.750
What the...

513
00:23:10.300 --> 00:23:13.100
Oh, my God. What...

514
00:23:13.140 --> 00:23:16.110
Wyatt.

515
00:23:22.010 --> 00:23:25.420
Oh, man, the Red Rocket
is driving my tour bus.


516
00:23:25.450 --> 00:23:26.650
Somebody pinch me!

517
00:23:26.680 --> 00:23:28.420
Thanks a lot, kid.
I appreciate it.


518
00:23:28.450 --> 00:23:31.220
Uh, listen, I know that you
hear this all the time,


519
00:23:31.260 --> 00:23:33.090
but I am your biggest fan.
Yeah.


520
00:23:33.120 --> 00:23:34.090
Hi. I'm Chris.

521
00:23:34.130 --> 00:23:35.090
Chris.
Yeah.


522
00:23:35.130 --> 00:23:36.460
Not a good time to talk.

523
00:23:36.490 --> 00:23:38.060
No, no, I know.
With the earthquakes


524
00:23:38.100 --> 00:23:39.500
and everything
and the spiders.


525
00:23:39.530 --> 00:23:41.600
There are spiders, buddy.
No, no, no, I know.


526
00:23:41.630 --> 00:23:43.770
Big as your freaking body.
Big as my body.


527
00:23:43.800 --> 00:23:46.740
The thing is, is that I've
watched all your movies.


528
00:23:46.770 --> 00:23:49.070
I know all your lines.
Nice tattoo. Yah!


529
00:23:49.110 --> 00:23:52.010
Look, Chris, this is
not a good time
to discuss film.


530
00:23:52.040 --> 00:23:53.510
Sure.
Sure, sure, sure, sure.


531
00:23:53.540 --> 00:23:55.150
But seriously,
am I on, like,


532
00:23:55.180 --> 00:23:56.850
a hidden-camera show
or something?


533
00:23:56.880 --> 00:23:59.620
'Cause I could have swore
I saw a camera right there.


534
00:23:59.650 --> 00:24:00.950
Yeah. Yeah.
There's cameras
everywhere. Look...


535
00:24:00.990 --> 00:24:01.990
I knew it.

536
00:24:02.020 --> 00:24:03.420
you want to be
a good boy,


537
00:24:03.450 --> 00:24:05.690
tell everybody
to sit down and hold on.


538
00:24:05.720 --> 00:24:09.160
All right, I need everybody
to hold on and sit down.


539
00:24:09.190 --> 00:24:10.690
Colton West,
action hero!


540
00:24:13.330 --> 00:24:15.770
Yeah. See,
the problem is that,


541
00:24:15.800 --> 00:24:18.970
like, 90% of these people
don't speak any English.


542
00:24:21.670 --> 00:24:24.040
Uh, we got a problem
up ahead.


543
00:24:26.710 --> 00:24:28.250
I hate spiders.

544
00:24:29.650 --> 00:24:31.550
Aah! Aah!

545
00:24:31.580 --> 00:24:33.180
What the hell is that?

546
00:24:41.860 --> 00:24:43.490
Oh, homina.

547
00:24:45.360 --> 00:24:46.560
Chris!
What?


548
00:24:46.600 --> 00:24:47.800
Switching.

549
00:24:47.830 --> 00:24:49.800
Really?

550
00:24:49.830 --> 00:24:51.570
No fare, no ride.

551
00:24:52.700 --> 00:24:55.910
Gun! Awesome!

552
00:24:55.940 --> 00:24:56.940
Top!

553
00:25:00.710 --> 00:25:02.680
Ah, there's one on top now.

554
00:25:02.710 --> 00:25:04.010
You gotta do something.

555
00:25:04.050 --> 00:25:05.120
I am doing something.

556
00:25:07.690 --> 00:25:09.690
Do that thing like you did
in that movie.


557
00:25:09.720 --> 00:25:11.760
Chris, you know
the difference between
real life and movies?


558
00:25:11.790 --> 00:25:12.760
No!
Darn.


559
00:25:12.790 --> 00:25:14.560
Well, what did I do?

560
00:25:14.590 --> 00:25:16.360
I don't know.
You, like, pulled
the emergency brake,


561
00:25:16.390 --> 00:25:17.360
and it did
something cool.


562
00:25:17.400 --> 00:25:19.200
Oh, yeah.

563
00:25:19.230 --> 00:25:20.800
Whoo!

564
00:25:33.580 --> 00:25:36.280
Colton West, I love you!

565
00:25:36.310 --> 00:25:38.120
Ah ha.
I love you, too.


566
00:25:38.150 --> 00:25:39.550
Me, too.

567
00:25:39.580 --> 00:25:40.580
Calm down, Chris.
Okay.


568
00:25:45.790 --> 00:25:47.190
I'm not
getting anything.


569
00:25:47.230 --> 00:25:49.230
How the hell are
we supposed to know


570
00:25:49.260 --> 00:25:51.400
what's going on outside
if we don't have
any cell service?


571
00:25:51.430 --> 00:25:52.930
Where did you
find that?


572
00:25:52.960 --> 00:25:54.700
Are you sure you know
what you're doing?


573
00:25:54.730 --> 00:25:56.200
You have to trust me, okay?

574
00:25:56.230 --> 00:25:57.470
We need to treat this.

575
00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:02.770
I know. I know.
I know. I know.


576
00:26:02.810 --> 00:26:06.240
You know, when I was
a little kid, I used
to come here all the time.


577
00:26:08.250 --> 00:26:11.080
They would film
a ton n n of movies here,


578
00:26:11.120 --> 00:26:14.990
and when my dad was shooting,
he would bring me on set.


579
00:26:17.320 --> 00:26:19.460
All right, This is really
gonna hurt, all right?


580
00:26:19.490 --> 00:26:22.030
Ohh! Oh, you think?

581
00:26:23.330 --> 00:26:25.730
What the heck
are those things?


582
00:26:25.760 --> 00:26:27.400
Ah, they look
like spiders.


583
00:26:27.430 --> 00:26:29.170
Spiders aren't
that big.


584
00:26:29.200 --> 00:26:32.100
Spiders don't spray
hot lava.


585
00:26:32.140 --> 00:26:33.500
Spiders--
I don't know, man. I don't know.


586
00:26:33.540 --> 00:26:34.670
It looked like
some kind of spider, though.


587
00:26:34.710 --> 00:26:36.740
Oh, it burns so bad.

588
00:26:38.140 --> 00:26:40.080
We gotta get some help.

589
00:26:40.110 --> 00:26:41.510
Maybe if we go up higher,

590
00:26:41.550 --> 00:26:43.310
we'd get some cell service,
something.


591
00:26:43.350 --> 00:26:45.220
Sure as hell ain't
going back outside.


592
00:26:47.350 --> 00:26:48.420
Okay.

593
00:26:48.450 --> 00:26:49.790
You guys smell that?

594
00:26:52.890 --> 00:26:54.860
They're trying
to get in.


595
00:26:58.530 --> 00:27:00.360
They're trying
to get in! Let's get
out of here!


596
00:27:00.400 --> 00:27:01.500
Okay. We gotta go.
We gotta go.


597
00:27:01.530 --> 00:27:02.500
Come on. Can you walk?

598
00:27:02.530 --> 00:27:04.870
Do I have a choice?
No.


599
00:27:04.900 --> 00:27:07.340
Come on.

600
00:27:07.370 --> 00:27:08.370
Come on. Let's go.
Let's go. Come on.


601
00:27:15.010 --> 00:27:17.610
Come on. Come on.

602
00:27:18.880 --> 00:27:19.850
Crap.

603
00:27:21.920 --> 00:27:24.650
As we continue
to bring you coverage


604
00:27:24.690 --> 00:27:25.990
of the L.A. eruptions,

605
00:27:26.020 --> 00:27:28.390
new details are emerging
by the minute.


606
00:27:28.430 --> 00:27:30.160
We've got exclusive footage

607
00:27:30.190 --> 00:27:33.200
of the damage from this
amazing volcanic activity.


608
00:27:33.230 --> 00:27:34.870
Now, the entire area
around the 405


609
00:27:34.900 --> 00:27:38.370
is closed from the 110
to the I-5


610
00:27:38.400 --> 00:27:41.540
while rescue crews scramble
to evacuate survivors


611
00:27:41.570 --> 00:27:43.010
and put out fires

612
00:27:43.040 --> 00:27:45.310
that are spreading
across the Sepulveda basin.


613
00:27:45.340 --> 00:27:49.810
Now, this one can be filed
under only in Hollyweird.


614
00:27:49.850 --> 00:27:54.550
We have unconfirmed reports
of a new breed of arachnids


615
00:27:54.590 --> 00:27:58.990
like these from the Hollywood
blockbuster "Spiders 3D"


616
00:27:59.020 --> 00:28:01.560
that have supposedly
been attacking Angelenos.


617
00:28:01.590 --> 00:28:02.830
That's right.

618
00:28:02.860 --> 00:28:04.930
Large, seemingly
prehistoric spiders


619
00:28:04.960 --> 00:28:07.230
have been emerging
from the chaos,


620
00:28:07.270 --> 00:28:08.730
and for more of this,

621
00:28:08.770 --> 00:28:11.740
we're gonna go to Sue Schnell
and her crew,


622
00:28:11.770 --> 00:28:14.240
who finally have been moved
to a safer location.


623
00:28:14.270 --> 00:28:15.670
Sue, what can you tell us?

624
00:28:15.710 --> 00:28:16.910
That's right, Dan.

625
00:28:16.940 --> 00:28:18.210
As you can see behind me here,

626
00:28:18.240 --> 00:28:19.780
the National Guard
has been called in


627
00:28:19.810 --> 00:28:22.010
to work
with local law enforcement


628
00:28:22.050 --> 00:28:25.520
to establish a safe perimeter
around the disaster zone.


629
00:28:25.550 --> 00:28:27.580
Although I haven't seen
anything myself,


630
00:28:27.620 --> 00:28:29.690
social media is all over this,

631
00:28:29.720 --> 00:28:31.690
with reports of giant
fire-breathing spiders


632
00:28:31.720 --> 00:28:33.920
that have only added
to the mayhem


633
00:28:33.960 --> 00:28:35.130
that has gripped the region.

634
00:28:35.160 --> 00:28:36.730
Excuse me?

635
00:28:38.730 --> 00:28:42.370
In other news, related or not,

636
00:28:42.400 --> 00:28:45.640
Colton West has apparently
hijacked a tour bus.


637
00:28:45.670 --> 00:28:47.440
Folks, we'll be back
in just a minute.


638
00:28:48.470 --> 00:28:50.440
What?

639
00:28:50.470 --> 00:28:51.470
Ohh.

640
00:28:57.250 --> 00:28:59.580
Okay. Okay.

641
00:28:59.620 --> 00:29:01.690
Okay.

642
00:29:13.900 --> 00:29:16.200
Let's do this.

643
00:29:43.060 --> 00:29:44.830
What are you waiting for?

644
00:29:55.410 --> 00:29:58.740
You messed
with the wrong house.


645
00:30:02.950 --> 00:30:04.980
I wanna get
a picture with the spider.


646
00:30:07.090 --> 00:30:09.720
Uh, Mr. West,
what do you think


647
00:30:09.750 --> 00:30:11.560
is in the blood
of these things?


648
00:30:11.590 --> 00:30:13.460
I don't want
to study 'em, Chris.


649
00:30:13.490 --> 00:30:15.060
I just want
to kill 'em.


650
00:30:15.090 --> 00:30:16.760
Yeah. Well,
whatever it is,


651
00:30:16.800 --> 00:30:18.430
it's eating
through the bus.


652
00:30:18.460 --> 00:30:20.800
What do you think happens
when it hits gas?


653
00:30:20.830 --> 00:30:23.500
Hang on, everybody.
Hang on!


654
00:30:27.310 --> 00:30:28.440
Everybody off!
Go!


655
00:30:28.470 --> 00:30:30.310
Everybody off!
Go! Go! Go!


656
00:30:30.340 --> 00:30:31.580
Everybody
off now!


657
00:30:31.610 --> 00:30:33.010
Go! Go! Go!

658
00:30:33.040 --> 00:30:34.450
Go! Go! Go!

659
00:30:34.480 --> 00:30:36.050
I'm last.
Go! Go! Go!


660
00:30:37.820 --> 00:30:39.020
Go! Go! Go! Go!

661
00:30:39.050 --> 00:30:40.350
Get off!
Let's go!


662
00:30:40.390 --> 00:30:41.950
Come on!

663
00:30:49.860 --> 00:30:51.800
Oh, my God!

664
00:30:51.830 --> 00:30:54.770
Everybody's off
that bus, aren't they?


665
00:30:54.800 --> 00:30:55.830
Yeah.

666
00:30:55.870 --> 00:30:57.840
Clear the area!

667
00:30:57.870 --> 00:30:59.200
You saved us.

668
00:30:59.240 --> 00:31:01.670
No.
You're the man!


669
00:31:01.710 --> 00:31:03.010
I didn't save anybody.

670
00:31:03.040 --> 00:31:04.680
Yeah.

671
00:31:04.710 --> 00:31:07.680
We still got act two
and act three to go.


672
00:31:07.710 --> 00:31:09.510
Movie talk.

673
00:31:09.550 --> 00:31:10.510
Yeah.

674
00:31:10.550 --> 00:31:11.620
Yeah.

675
00:31:11.650 --> 00:31:14.020
Movie talk.

676
00:31:15.490 --> 00:31:17.390
But now for many Angelenos

677
00:31:17.420 --> 00:31:20.020
who are used to the shaking
and the fires,


678
00:31:20.060 --> 00:31:21.790
it's as if nothing
is happening,


679
00:31:21.830 --> 00:31:23.160
and for that story,

680
00:31:23.190 --> 00:31:24.960
we have Ed Mendez
on Hollywood Boulevard.


681
00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:26.560
Ed, what can you tell us?

682
00:31:26.600 --> 00:31:28.330
Thanks, Dan. And it is true

683
00:31:28.370 --> 00:31:30.800
that business and
leisure go on as usual,


684
00:31:30.840 --> 00:31:32.400
and most people
either haven't heard


685
00:31:32.440 --> 00:31:34.170
about these disasters
across town,


686
00:31:34.210 --> 00:31:35.970
or they simply
don't believe it,


687
00:31:36.010 --> 00:31:37.810
but that is quickly changing.

688
00:31:37.840 --> 00:31:41.480
Now, we are just blocks away
from where a tour bus exploded,


689
00:31:41.510 --> 00:31:43.480
rocking Hollywood Boulevard,

690
00:31:43.520 --> 00:31:46.520
shattering windows,
and setting off car alarms.


691
00:31:46.550 --> 00:31:48.750
There is so much smoke
in the area.


692
00:31:48.790 --> 00:31:51.760
This is as close as we can
possibly get to the scene,


693
00:31:51.790 --> 00:31:53.560
but I can tell you this much.

694
00:31:53.590 --> 00:31:55.330
Some of the passengers
were terrified,


695
00:31:55.360 --> 00:31:57.560
and they're claiming
that creatures


696
00:31:57.600 --> 00:32:01.030
they believe are spiders
attacked their bus,


697
00:32:01.070 --> 00:32:04.540
a literal avalanche
of lava-breathing spiders,


698
00:32:04.570 --> 00:32:06.200
lavalantulas.

699
00:32:06.240 --> 00:32:08.910
Were there any casualties
in this explosion?


700
00:32:08.940 --> 00:32:11.840
No. Apparently Colton West,

701
00:32:11.880 --> 00:32:15.750
who we're hearing hijacked that
very bus just moments earlier,


702
00:32:15.780 --> 00:32:19.420
was able to get everybody
to safety before it blew.


703
00:32:19.450 --> 00:32:20.750
Thank you, Ed.

704
00:32:20.790 --> 00:32:22.120
Okay. We're gonna
bring you more


705
00:32:22.150 --> 00:32:23.550
from the Santa Monica
Mountains,


706
00:32:23.590 --> 00:32:24.790
where the fire crews

707
00:32:24.820 --> 00:32:26.460
are struggling
to contain the chaos.


708
00:32:26.490 --> 00:32:28.730
Come on. Come on.

709
00:32:28.760 --> 00:32:30.760
Okay, okay.
Okay, I need a break.


710
00:32:30.800 --> 00:32:32.860
I need a break.
All right, all right.


711
00:32:32.900 --> 00:32:34.930
Grab that. Grab that.
Come on. Sit down.


712
00:32:34.970 --> 00:32:36.970
Okay.

713
00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:40.470
Ah, jeez.
Still no signal.


714
00:32:40.510 --> 00:32:42.310
Wonder if
the cell towers
are all out?


715
00:32:42.340 --> 00:32:43.740
The roof is gonna
be our only chance
to get out of here.


716
00:32:43.780 --> 00:32:45.240
But If all
the cell towers are out,


717
00:32:45.280 --> 00:32:46.740
how are we gonna
get in touch with anyone?


718
00:32:46.780 --> 00:32:48.210
I gotta flag down
a helicopter
or something.


719
00:32:48.250 --> 00:32:50.210
I don't even know.

720
00:32:50.250 --> 00:32:51.920
Hey, Wyatt,
come here for a second.


721
00:32:51.950 --> 00:32:53.320
What?

722
00:32:53.350 --> 00:32:57.250
Dude, I think
I should stay here with her


723
00:32:57.290 --> 00:32:59.590
while you go call for help.

724
00:32:59.620 --> 00:33:01.160
Okay. Okay.
Yeah, that's good.


725
00:33:01.190 --> 00:33:02.260
Cool. All right.

726
00:33:02.290 --> 00:33:03.790
All right.
Good luck, man.


727
00:33:03.830 --> 00:33:05.000
Come here. Come here.

728
00:33:05.030 --> 00:33:06.330
Easy.

729
00:33:06.360 --> 00:33:08.770
Travis, are you
trying to hit on her?


730
00:33:08.800 --> 00:33:11.570
Dude, you did the whole
bandage hero thing back there.


731
00:33:11.600 --> 00:33:12.840
Gotta get
my game in sometime.


732
00:33:12.870 --> 00:33:14.910
Travis. Travis,
she's injured.


733
00:33:14.940 --> 00:33:17.780
There are
fire-breathing spiders
chasing us right now.


734
00:33:17.810 --> 00:33:19.940
What is wrong with you?
Come on, man.


735
00:33:19.980 --> 00:33:21.610
It's my only angle, okay?

736
00:33:21.650 --> 00:33:22.950
It's your only angle?

737
00:33:22.980 --> 00:33:25.180
You gotta
be kidding me.


738
00:33:28.520 --> 00:33:30.020
Mm-hmm. Yep.
Okay, we gotta go.


739
00:33:30.060 --> 00:33:31.720
Come on.
Come on. Let's get
out of here.


740
00:33:37.700 --> 00:33:39.700
This is a mandatory evac,
boys.


741
00:33:39.730 --> 00:33:41.630
No one is to be
left behind.
you understand?


742
00:33:41.670 --> 00:33:44.100
If you see
any of those spiders,
you don't even hesitate.


743
00:33:44.140 --> 00:33:45.970
You shoot to kill.
Got it.


744
00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:47.940
Rico, Lance, I want you
to take the north side
of the street.


745
00:33:47.970 --> 00:33:49.210
Hernandez, I want you
to come with me.


746
00:33:49.240 --> 00:33:50.640
All right, let's go.

747
00:33:50.680 --> 00:33:52.910
All right, let's go.
Move it. Move it.


748
00:34:06.930 --> 00:34:08.890
What took you
so long?


749
00:34:08.930 --> 00:34:10.690
We gotta get you
out of here.


750
00:34:10.730 --> 00:34:11.700
We're evacuating
the whole neighborhood.


751
00:34:11.730 --> 00:34:14.030
Lead the way.

752
00:34:14.070 --> 00:34:18.000
The scale
of casualties is terrifying...


753
00:34:25.610 --> 00:34:26.980
Any luck?

754
00:34:27.010 --> 00:34:28.310
No. You got a phone?

755
00:34:28.350 --> 00:34:29.810
No.

756
00:34:29.850 --> 00:34:30.880
What's his name?

757
00:34:30.920 --> 00:34:32.250
Wyatt.

758
00:34:32.280 --> 00:34:34.020
Like Wyatt Earp?

759
00:34:34.050 --> 00:34:35.490
Yeah, like Wyatt Earp.

760
00:34:35.520 --> 00:34:36.990
So what's next?

761
00:34:37.020 --> 00:34:38.360
Next?

762
00:34:38.390 --> 00:34:40.760
Next is you go home.
No.


763
00:34:40.790 --> 00:34:42.760
You go to Kansas
or Louisiana


764
00:34:42.790 --> 00:34:44.660
or Wyoming,
and you get safe.


765
00:34:44.700 --> 00:34:45.760
That's what next.

766
00:34:45.800 --> 00:34:47.560
Des Moines. Yeah.
Des Moines.


767
00:34:47.600 --> 00:34:48.930
Argh, maties.

768
00:34:48.970 --> 00:34:51.270
Who wants their photo
with Pirate Jack?


769
00:34:51.300 --> 00:34:52.500
Argh!

770
00:34:52.540 --> 00:34:54.100
Colton West?

771
00:34:54.140 --> 00:34:55.540
Yeah.

772
00:34:55.570 --> 00:34:56.870
It's me,
Dave Alexander.


773
00:34:56.910 --> 00:34:58.540
I did stunts
on "Swamp Justice"...


774
00:34:58.580 --> 00:34:59.780
Dave!
like, 20 years ago.


775
00:34:59.810 --> 00:35:00.940
Dave Alexander,
yeah.


776
00:35:00.980 --> 00:35:02.110
Yeah. Yeah.
You look great.


777
00:35:02.150 --> 00:35:03.280
Thanks.
I--I lost an arm


778
00:35:03.310 --> 00:35:04.880
on the set
a couple years ago.


779
00:35:04.920 --> 00:35:06.520
Stunt went bad.

780
00:35:06.550 --> 00:35:08.090
Sorry to hear
about it. You got
pigeonholed, huh?


781
00:35:08.120 --> 00:35:10.120
Yeah. Not a lot of work
for a one-armed stunt guy.


782
00:35:10.160 --> 00:35:13.120
Look, Dave, we got
a problem here!


783
00:35:13.160 --> 00:35:14.390
I know.
I saw your bus.


784
00:35:14.430 --> 00:35:16.090
Phew!
No, we--


785
00:35:16.130 --> 00:35:17.630
Look, I got this.
Pirate Jack.


786
00:35:17.660 --> 00:35:19.930
Dave.
Dave, sorry.


787
00:35:19.960 --> 00:35:21.400
This city is
in great danger, okay?


788
00:35:21.430 --> 00:35:23.270
The earthquakes
are unleashing giant spiders


789
00:35:23.300 --> 00:35:25.070
that are attacking
the city.


790
00:35:26.440 --> 00:35:27.810
You don't know
about this?


791
00:35:27.840 --> 00:35:29.370
Oh, the helicopters
and the smoke and all?


792
00:35:29.410 --> 00:35:31.240
I just figured it was
another fire in the hills.


793
00:35:31.280 --> 00:35:33.740
No. There's a volcano
in the hills the size
of Vesuvius.


794
00:35:33.780 --> 00:35:35.210
So this spider thing's
for real?


795
00:35:35.250 --> 00:35:36.980
Yes.
Look, Pirate Jack,


796
00:35:37.020 --> 00:35:39.080
we just need to get
downtown to his son.


797
00:35:39.120 --> 00:35:40.880
You got a car,
a truck, anything?


798
00:35:40.920 --> 00:35:42.420
Yeah, I can give you a lift.
Great.


799
00:35:42.450 --> 00:35:43.920
Let's go get a beer.
It's been too long.


800
00:35:43.960 --> 00:35:45.120
We don't have time.

801
00:35:45.160 --> 00:35:47.220
Dave, please,
take me downtown.


802
00:35:47.260 --> 00:35:48.790
All right, Colt. Jeez.

803
00:35:50.500 --> 00:35:52.260
It's happening again.

804
00:35:52.300 --> 00:35:54.260
These earthquakes are
getting on my nerves.


805
00:35:54.300 --> 00:35:55.800
You find somewhere safe.

806
00:35:55.830 --> 00:35:57.270
We gotta warn people.

807
00:35:57.300 --> 00:35:59.000
What about the ride?

808
00:35:59.040 --> 00:36:00.500
Get off the street!
Go!


809
00:36:00.540 --> 00:36:02.340
Everybody,
get off the street!
Take cover!


810
00:36:02.370 --> 00:36:03.440
Everybody,
get off the street!


811
00:36:03.470 --> 00:36:04.810
Get off the street!

812
00:36:04.840 --> 00:36:06.840
Look, make sure
everybody finds cover


813
00:36:06.880 --> 00:36:08.510
and everybody gets safe.
You got me?


814
00:36:08.550 --> 00:36:09.980
Yeah.
Okay.


815
00:36:10.010 --> 00:36:11.180
So, I'm--
I'm, like,
your costar.


816
00:36:11.220 --> 00:36:12.450
Yeah,
You're my costar.


817
00:36:12.480 --> 00:36:13.450
Yeah.
Right, right.


818
00:36:13.480 --> 00:36:14.590
Just meet me
back here.


819
00:36:14.620 --> 00:36:15.590
Don't lose me!

820
00:36:15.620 --> 00:36:16.790
Okay. Okay.

821
00:36:16.820 --> 00:36:18.020
Get the hell
out of here!


822
00:36:18.060 --> 00:36:19.760
Dan, I have to tell you,

823
00:36:19.790 --> 00:36:21.460
there is a growing feeling...
This is an emergency!


824
00:36:21.490 --> 00:36:23.160
that these reports
of spiders


825
00:36:23.190 --> 00:36:25.260
are actually
part of publicity stunt


826
00:36:25.300 --> 00:36:27.930
for an upcoming
Hollywood blockbuster.


827
00:36:27.970 --> 00:36:29.970
Oh, God.

828
00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:31.370
Oh, my God.

829
00:36:56.600 --> 00:36:57.930
Run!

830
00:36:57.960 --> 00:37:00.000
Everybody get off
the streets!


831
00:37:00.030 --> 00:37:01.700
Girls, get off the streets!
There are giant spiders!


832
00:37:01.730 --> 00:37:03.700
Everybody,
get off the street!
Get off the street!


833
00:37:03.740 --> 00:37:05.340
Hey--
Hey. Hey!


834
00:37:05.370 --> 00:37:06.700
Colton West! Nice shotgun.
Yeah!


835
00:37:06.740 --> 00:37:08.840
I know you.
I know you from--


836
00:37:08.870 --> 00:37:10.110
Look, you gotta
get off the streets.


837
00:37:10.140 --> 00:37:11.910
There's giant spiders
everywhere.


838
00:37:11.940 --> 00:37:14.610
I'd love to help you, but I
got shark problems right now.


839
00:37:56.060 --> 00:37:57.790
Yeah! Yeah.

840
00:37:58.860 --> 00:38:00.230
You're welcome, kid.

841
00:38:00.260 --> 00:38:01.260
Yeah!

842
00:38:06.630 --> 00:38:09.140
Die! Die! Die!

843
00:38:13.470 --> 00:38:14.770
Gotta get outta here.

844
00:38:14.810 --> 00:38:16.210
Yeah.
This way!


845
00:38:21.650 --> 00:38:22.650
Get in!

846
00:38:23.750 --> 00:38:25.480
Jack.

847
00:38:27.960 --> 00:38:31.090
Go! Go! Go!
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!


848
00:38:40.330 --> 00:38:41.400
Keep moving, people.

849
00:38:41.440 --> 00:38:43.970
On the truck.
On the truck.


850
00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:45.570
Go ahead, too.

851
00:38:45.610 --> 00:38:47.240
All the way to the front.
All the way to the front.


852
00:38:49.410 --> 00:38:51.880
Let's go.
Come on.


853
00:38:51.910 --> 00:38:53.410
Get everybody in.

854
00:38:56.150 --> 00:38:57.720
Take your time. Let's go.

855
00:38:57.750 --> 00:38:59.220
Where are we going?

856
00:38:59.250 --> 00:39:00.890
We're going
out of the city.


857
00:39:00.920 --> 00:39:01.820
How bad is this?

858
00:39:01.820 --> 00:39:03.960
It's bad. The city's
completely unstable.


859
00:39:03.990 --> 00:39:06.330
Los Angeles is under
a military evac.


860
00:39:06.360 --> 00:39:09.030
No, no, no. Wait. Wait.
I--I can't just leave.
My family is still out there.


861
00:39:09.060 --> 00:39:10.960
All right. You don't
have a choice,
all right?


862
00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:13.170
This is martial law.
Excuse me?


863
00:39:13.200 --> 00:39:14.600
Listen,
I'm sorry, ma'am.


864
00:39:14.640 --> 00:39:15.970
This is completely
unprecedented.


865
00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:17.300
We weren't prepared
for this.


866
00:39:17.340 --> 00:39:18.310
I'm not leaving
without my family.


867
00:39:18.340 --> 00:39:19.710
I need to find them.

868
00:39:19.740 --> 00:39:21.780
We'll find your family,
I promise you,


869
00:39:21.810 --> 00:39:23.010
if they're still alive.

870
00:39:28.150 --> 00:39:30.280
Move it up, sir!

871
00:39:30.320 --> 00:39:32.490
Move it out! Let's go!

872
00:39:40.600 --> 00:39:42.360
Hey, what happened
to your parrot?


873
00:39:42.400 --> 00:39:44.830
How could you possibly
care about something
like that now?


874
00:39:44.870 --> 00:39:46.630
Giant spiders
are trying to kill us.


875
00:39:46.670 --> 00:39:48.540
I didn't think
you guys were serious
about these.


876
00:39:48.570 --> 00:39:49.800
Well, of course
we're serious.


877
00:39:49.840 --> 00:39:52.210
Oh, they took out
the Blue Oyster.


878
00:39:52.240 --> 00:39:53.470
I love that place.

879
00:39:53.510 --> 00:39:55.340
Jack, just get us
downtown.


880
00:39:55.380 --> 00:39:57.240
How is this even
possible? How is
this happening?


881
00:39:57.280 --> 00:39:58.910
Well, you know,
just last week,


882
00:39:58.950 --> 00:40:01.680
they found a new species
of wasp in the Chinese jungle,


883
00:40:01.720 --> 00:40:03.750
eight-inch wingspan,
four-inch stinger.


884
00:40:03.780 --> 00:40:05.390
Well, these things
are a lot bigger
than eight inches!


885
00:40:05.420 --> 00:40:07.750
I'm just saying.
New species, my ass.


886
00:40:07.790 --> 00:40:10.920
This is that
Japanese radiation leak
making its way over.


887
00:40:10.960 --> 00:40:12.560
Guys, let's stop
discussing biology!


888
00:40:12.590 --> 00:40:15.260
Get me downtown
so I can get my son!


889
00:40:18.430 --> 00:40:19.830
Come on.

890
00:40:19.870 --> 00:40:23.040
We gotta go faster.
Come on.


891
00:40:23.070 --> 00:40:25.370
I can't. I can't
go any further.


892
00:40:25.410 --> 00:40:26.570
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
I need to sit down.


893
00:40:26.610 --> 00:40:27.740
Okay. Whoa.
Sit down.


894
00:40:27.780 --> 00:40:28.880
It hurts so bad.

895
00:40:28.910 --> 00:40:30.440
What, is it too tight?
Uh-huh.


896
00:40:30.480 --> 00:40:32.180
Okay. Let me see.
Let me see.


897
00:40:32.210 --> 00:40:33.980
Okay, come on.

898
00:40:35.980 --> 00:40:39.090
Oh, God. Ohh!
Oh, my God.


899
00:40:39.120 --> 00:40:40.720
Shut up. Shut up.
Shut up. Hey, shut up.


900
00:40:40.760 --> 00:40:41.790
Shut up. It's fine.
It's not that bad.


901
00:40:41.820 --> 00:40:43.120
Are you freaking
kidding me?


902
00:40:43.160 --> 00:40:44.420
She's too young
to die, bro.


903
00:40:44.460 --> 00:40:46.190
Shut up.
Calm down. Calm down.


904
00:40:46.190 --> 00:40:47.730
We can't panic
right now, okay? Calm down.


905
00:40:47.760 --> 00:40:50.260
You can't freak out
on me right now, okay?


906
00:40:50.300 --> 00:40:51.270
Come on.

907
00:40:52.100 --> 00:40:53.270
I gotta get to the roof.

908
00:40:53.300 --> 00:40:54.300
Man,
you can't leave us.


909
00:40:54.340 --> 00:40:55.540
Just stay
with her, man.


910
00:40:55.570 --> 00:40:57.100
We gotta try.

911
00:40:58.640 --> 00:41:00.140
Whoa!
Come on! We gotta go!


912
00:41:00.170 --> 00:41:01.540
Back! Back! Back!
Come on.


913
00:41:01.580 --> 00:41:02.540
Come on!

914
00:41:02.580 --> 00:41:04.880
Go!

915
00:41:04.910 --> 00:41:07.110
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

916
00:41:12.420 --> 00:41:14.120
What the hell is that?

917
00:41:14.150 --> 00:41:16.720
What the hell?!
Lava! Lava!


918
00:41:26.970 --> 00:41:28.100
Why are we stopping?

919
00:41:28.140 --> 00:41:29.770
Something's wrong.

920
00:41:35.210 --> 00:41:38.880
This is gonna get bad
really, really fast.


921
00:41:39.950 --> 00:41:41.410
Let's get out of here.

922
00:41:41.450 --> 00:41:43.080
We're not going anywhere.

923
00:41:43.120 --> 00:41:45.020
Ah, man,
these were brand-new.


924
00:41:45.050 --> 00:41:48.020
Uh, fellas, look!

925
00:41:55.400 --> 00:41:57.360
Man, I hate being right.

926
00:41:57.400 --> 00:41:59.700
Get in the museum!
Why the museum?


927
00:41:59.730 --> 00:42:02.200
Because that's
the only building
without spiders on it!


928
00:42:02.240 --> 00:42:05.170
Not yet, but they look
pretty determined.


929
00:42:08.010 --> 00:42:10.080
Barricade the doors!

930
00:42:10.110 --> 00:42:12.850
Close them up!
Close them up!


931
00:42:12.880 --> 00:42:14.510
Come on!
Throw everything you can!


932
00:42:18.990 --> 00:42:20.920
Come on! Hurry up!

933
00:42:20.950 --> 00:42:22.490
Anything!
Just grab anything!


934
00:42:22.520 --> 00:42:23.520
Jam it up.

935
00:42:24.620 --> 00:42:25.590
I got one more.

936
00:42:25.630 --> 00:42:27.560
I got one more.

937
00:42:29.700 --> 00:42:31.530
You feel safe?

938
00:42:31.530 --> 00:42:31.730
Not even
a little bit.


939
00:42:31.770 --> 00:42:32.870
No.
You got a plan?


940
00:42:32.900 --> 00:42:33.870
Uh, run.

941
00:42:33.900 --> 00:42:34.900
Run! Run!
Run!


942
00:42:40.070 --> 00:42:41.980
Gotta get
out of here.


943
00:42:42.010 --> 00:42:43.810
We're not
getting out of here.
There's spiders outside.


944
00:42:43.840 --> 00:42:45.050
We gotta find
somewhere to hide.


945
00:42:45.080 --> 00:42:46.580
There's nowhere to hide.

946
00:42:46.610 --> 00:42:49.520
When those things want
to find you, they will.


947
00:42:49.550 --> 00:42:50.580
Who are you?

948
00:42:50.620 --> 00:42:52.890
I am Dr. Erik
Von Struebel.


949
00:42:52.920 --> 00:42:54.220
I work here
in the museum.


950
00:42:54.260 --> 00:42:55.520
What are you
still doing here?


951
00:42:55.560 --> 00:42:58.160
I'm a scientist.
For good or bad,


952
00:42:58.190 --> 00:43:00.990
these are
the kind of moments
that we live for.


953
00:43:01.030 --> 00:43:02.160
Well, you're not gonna
live for much longer


954
00:43:02.200 --> 00:43:03.600
if you stick around
here, Doc.


955
00:43:03.630 --> 00:43:07.030
Yes. I am acutely aware
of that possibility,


956
00:43:07.070 --> 00:43:08.700
but I'm not done.

957
00:43:08.740 --> 00:43:09.900
Done?

958
00:43:09.940 --> 00:43:10.940
Done with what?

959
00:43:16.440 --> 00:43:20.280
The heat grid is like
an interconnected network,


960
00:43:20.310 --> 00:43:21.950
lava tubes probably,

961
00:43:21.980 --> 00:43:25.020
with the temperature
increasing exponentially.


962
00:43:25.050 --> 00:43:27.220
So why didn't
anybody say anything
about this before?


963
00:43:27.250 --> 00:43:29.520
We didn't see it coming.

964
00:43:29.560 --> 00:43:31.720
It happened too quickly.

965
00:43:31.760 --> 00:43:33.460
I mean, we're talking
five days ago,


966
00:43:33.490 --> 00:43:35.960
and it's like,
"Oh, that's odd."


967
00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:40.300
Then under a week later,
the hills are active volcanoes.


968
00:43:40.330 --> 00:43:43.040
What should have taken
over a million years


969
00:43:43.070 --> 00:43:45.640
almost happened
overnight.


970
00:43:45.670 --> 00:43:47.110
So if this is correct,

971
00:43:47.140 --> 00:43:48.810
this explains
why these things


972
00:43:48.840 --> 00:43:50.240
are exploding
all over the city.


973
00:43:50.280 --> 00:43:53.250
This city
is a ticking time bomb.


974
00:43:53.280 --> 00:43:55.650
Wait. What does this
have to do with spiders
attacking the city?


975
00:43:55.680 --> 00:43:58.620
Actually, everything.

976
00:43:58.650 --> 00:44:03.620
When I compared the pattern
of the lava tube network,


977
00:44:03.660 --> 00:44:08.060
it had a very close structure
to that of an insect colony.


978
00:44:08.100 --> 00:44:09.730
So wait. They had
something in common?


979
00:44:09.760 --> 00:44:12.070
They're exactly
the same.


980
00:44:12.100 --> 00:44:15.470
The volcanoes
and the spiders are one.


981
00:44:16.600 --> 00:44:19.310
The Mayans
had a term for it,


982
00:44:19.340 --> 00:44:21.670
lavalantula.

983
00:44:22.680 --> 00:44:24.140
And right here...

984
00:44:25.510 --> 00:44:27.910
this would be
the queen's chamber.


985
00:44:27.950 --> 00:44:33.150
If you kill the Mamalantula,
you kill them all.


986
00:44:35.860 --> 00:44:36.960
Whoa.

987
00:44:39.060 --> 00:44:40.760
We better go check
on that front door.


988
00:44:40.790 --> 00:44:41.830
What are you doing?

989
00:44:41.860 --> 00:44:43.760
Science class
is over, Doc.


990
00:44:43.800 --> 00:44:47.430
I'm gonna go get my kid,
and when we're done,


991
00:44:47.470 --> 00:44:50.170
you and I, Jack, we're
gonna have that beer.


992
00:44:50.200 --> 00:44:51.200
You're buying.

993
00:44:53.070 --> 00:44:55.640
Oh, that is so badass.

994
00:44:55.680 --> 00:44:58.510
Wait. No, no, no.

995
00:44:58.550 --> 00:45:00.810
I--I meant you're badass,
not I'm badass.


996
00:45:00.850 --> 00:45:02.380
Guys?

997
00:45:02.420 --> 00:45:03.420
Colt?

998
00:45:10.660 --> 00:45:12.960
Come in, Evac 670.
What's your 20?


999
00:45:12.990 --> 00:45:14.230
This is Evac 670.

1000
00:45:14.260 --> 00:45:16.230
We are westbound
on Forest Lawn.


1001
00:45:16.260 --> 00:45:18.230
670, turn around
immediately.


1002
00:45:18.270 --> 00:45:20.700
The Forest Lawn area
is highly unstable
right now.


1003
00:45:20.730 --> 00:45:22.200
Do you have
an alternate route?


1004
00:45:22.240 --> 00:45:23.900
Negative, just get
off that road.


1005
00:45:24.940 --> 00:45:26.540
What's happening?

1006
00:45:26.570 --> 00:45:28.710
Want you to stay here.

1007
00:45:28.740 --> 00:45:30.740
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa. You can't
just leave us here.


1008
00:45:30.780 --> 00:45:32.180
All right.
I want you to get down,


1009
00:45:32.210 --> 00:45:34.710
and I want you
to stay down.


1010
00:45:34.750 --> 00:45:36.650
- This should keep you safe.
- On your six!


1011
00:45:36.680 --> 00:45:38.550
I'm not good at staying down.

1012
00:45:38.590 --> 00:45:41.490
If you want
to live, you get that ass
under that fire blanket.


1013
00:45:42.520 --> 00:45:44.490
Really need to curse.

1014
00:45:44.530 --> 00:45:46.590
Get down!

1015
00:45:49.860 --> 00:45:51.330
This place is like
a freaking maze.


1016
00:45:51.370 --> 00:45:52.730
I think there's
a stairwell right there.


1017
00:45:52.770 --> 00:45:55.540
Oh, you think?

1018
00:46:07.920 --> 00:46:09.450
These things
don't give up.


1019
00:46:09.480 --> 00:46:11.950
Shh, shh, shh, shh.
Keep your voice down.


1020
00:46:11.990 --> 00:46:13.220
Come on. Come on.

1021
00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:26.630
Okay, come on.
Come on.


1022
00:46:26.670 --> 00:46:28.300
Let's go. Let's go.
Let's go. Let's go.


1023
00:46:28.340 --> 00:46:29.740
God.

1024
00:46:29.770 --> 00:46:31.540
I think it's gone.

1025
00:46:32.840 --> 00:46:35.240
Run! Go! Go!

1026
00:46:35.280 --> 00:46:36.910
You got her?

1027
00:46:36.940 --> 00:46:38.340
You got her?
Come on! Here it comes!


1028
00:46:40.580 --> 00:46:41.750
What the hell
are you doing?


1029
00:46:41.780 --> 00:46:42.750
I got this!

1030
00:46:49.290 --> 00:46:50.290
I got it!

1031
00:46:53.430 --> 00:46:54.760
How'd you know
that was gonna work?


1032
00:46:54.800 --> 00:46:55.800
I didn't!

1033
00:46:59.530 --> 00:47:01.670
Go!

1034
00:47:05.270 --> 00:47:07.110
There's too many
of them, man!


1035
00:47:07.140 --> 00:47:09.640
We gotta get
these civilians
out of here.


1036
00:47:09.680 --> 00:47:11.180
They breathe fire, man.

1037
00:47:11.210 --> 00:47:12.210
Yeah,
I can see that.


1038
00:47:14.650 --> 00:47:17.320
Now they're
closing in.


1039
00:47:17.350 --> 00:47:19.450
We are not
going down
like this.


1040
00:47:19.490 --> 00:47:20.750
Do you have a shot?
Yeah.


1041
00:47:22.320 --> 00:47:23.320
Run!

1042
00:47:26.790 --> 00:47:28.330
We gotta move now, man.

1043
00:47:28.360 --> 00:47:29.500
Yeah, and do what?

1044
00:47:29.530 --> 00:47:31.130
We gonna head back
to the city?


1045
00:47:31.170 --> 00:47:32.530
Well, we can't go
this way, man.


1046
00:47:32.570 --> 00:47:33.700
Yeah, but we need
reinforcements.


1047
00:47:33.730 --> 00:47:36.040
Man, we are
the reinforcements!


1048
00:47:43.380 --> 00:47:44.710
Clever girl.

1049
00:48:25.390 --> 00:48:27.920
Oh, no.

1050
00:48:46.270 --> 00:48:48.640
Oh! Eww, eww, eww.

1051
00:48:50.710 --> 00:48:51.940
Oh, my God.

1052
00:48:56.580 --> 00:48:57.950
Key.

1053
00:48:57.990 --> 00:48:59.720
Oh.

1054
00:49:01.090 --> 00:49:03.960
Evac 670,
can you read me?


1055
00:49:03.990 --> 00:49:05.390
Hello?

1056
00:49:05.430 --> 00:49:06.890
Did you copy
the last transmission?


1057
00:49:06.930 --> 00:49:08.800
Get off Forest Lawn.

1058
00:49:08.830 --> 00:49:10.100
All your men are gone.

1059
00:49:10.130 --> 00:49:12.200
Everyone is dead.
Do you hear me?


1060
00:49:12.230 --> 00:49:13.800
Who is this?

1061
00:49:13.830 --> 00:49:15.870
My name is Olivia West.

1062
00:49:15.900 --> 00:49:18.300
I'm the sole survivor.
Well, please be advised


1063
00:49:18.340 --> 00:49:20.370
to get out of
Los Angeles immediately.


1064
00:49:20.410 --> 00:49:21.710
Yeah. Well, thanks
for the great advice,


1065
00:49:21.740 --> 00:49:22.880
but I can't
really do that.


1066
00:49:22.910 --> 00:49:24.480
My family is
still here in L.A.


1067
00:49:24.510 --> 00:49:27.150
Repeat. Los Angeles
is highly unstable
right now.


1068
00:49:27.180 --> 00:49:29.380
Why don't you give me
some good information,


1069
00:49:29.420 --> 00:49:30.980
like where's
the fricking key?


1070
00:49:31.020 --> 00:49:32.450
There is no key, ma'am.

1071
00:49:32.490 --> 00:49:34.990
Flip two switches marked
"battery" and "run."


1072
00:49:35.020 --> 00:49:38.620
You're advised
to get out as soon
as possible.


1073
00:49:38.660 --> 00:49:40.190
Not without my family.

1074
00:49:49.970 --> 00:49:51.240
Come on.

1075
00:49:51.270 --> 00:49:52.240
You still with us?

1076
00:49:52.270 --> 00:49:53.340
How you doing?

1077
00:49:53.370 --> 00:49:54.510
How you doing, Jordan?
Jordan!


1078
00:49:54.540 --> 00:49:55.640
Jordan!

1079
00:49:56.780 --> 00:49:57.740
Jordan!

1080
00:49:57.780 --> 00:49:58.910
Jordan.
Whoa, whoa.


1081
00:49:58.950 --> 00:49:59.950
She's freaking out, man.

1082
00:49:59.980 --> 00:50:01.850
Jordan, come on.
Come on.


1083
00:50:01.880 --> 00:50:03.320
Jordan, look at me.
Look at me.


1084
00:50:03.350 --> 00:50:04.580
Water, water.
Get some water.


1085
00:50:04.620 --> 00:50:06.020
From where?
I don't know, man.


1086
00:50:06.050 --> 00:50:08.020
Jordan, look at me.
No, come on.


1087
00:50:08.060 --> 00:50:09.620
Jordan! Jordan!

1088
00:50:09.660 --> 00:50:11.820
Jordan! Jordan!
Come on.


1089
00:50:11.860 --> 00:50:13.460
Stay with us.
Come on.


1090
00:50:15.730 --> 00:50:16.700
Jordan.

1091
00:50:16.730 --> 00:50:17.700
What the--

1092
00:50:17.730 --> 00:50:19.400
Is she dead?

1093
00:50:20.530 --> 00:50:22.130
I don't know.

1094
00:50:29.810 --> 00:50:33.050
Jordan! Jordan!

1095
00:50:34.310 --> 00:50:35.880
Ho. Dude.

1096
00:50:37.520 --> 00:50:40.250
Jordan.

1097
00:50:44.590 --> 00:50:45.990
What's happening?!
No! No!


1098
00:50:46.030 --> 00:50:47.160
What's happening?!
Oh, my God!


1099
00:50:47.190 --> 00:50:49.230
Make it stop!

1100
00:50:49.260 --> 00:50:50.400
Oh, my God!

1101
00:50:50.430 --> 00:50:52.370
What the...

1102
00:50:52.400 --> 00:50:54.170
No! No!

1103
00:50:55.940 --> 00:50:56.900
Get 'em off me, man!

1104
00:50:56.940 --> 00:50:57.970
No! Ahh!

1105
00:51:01.040 --> 00:51:02.710
No! No! Ahh!

1106
00:51:09.050 --> 00:51:11.020
Come on. Come on.

1107
00:51:16.890 --> 00:51:17.890
Right.

1108
00:51:25.430 --> 00:51:26.930
Where are you?

1109
00:51:29.870 --> 00:51:31.440
My phone.

1110
00:51:31.470 --> 00:51:33.270
My phone's working.

1111
00:51:33.310 --> 00:51:34.910
It's from Wyatt.

1112
00:51:34.940 --> 00:51:36.440
Heh.

1113
00:51:36.480 --> 00:51:37.580
He's trapped.

1114
00:51:37.610 --> 00:51:39.750
He's at Hanson Studios.

1115
00:51:39.780 --> 00:51:41.650
It's at Seventh and Olympic.
We gotta get there.


1116
00:51:41.680 --> 00:51:43.220
Hey, guys.

1117
00:51:45.820 --> 00:51:48.620
That is
a very large arachnid.


1118
00:51:57.970 --> 00:51:59.230
The freaking kraken.

1119
00:52:00.900 --> 00:52:01.970
And it's coming
this way.


1120
00:52:02.000 --> 00:52:02.970
Get back!

1121
00:52:03.010 --> 00:52:04.170
Lavalantula!

1122
00:52:12.050 --> 00:52:13.350
Ah, no!

1123
00:52:13.380 --> 00:52:14.980
Ah! Ah, look!
Oh!


1124
00:52:15.020 --> 00:52:16.050
They're in here!

1125
00:52:16.080 --> 00:52:17.550
They're all in here!

1126
00:52:17.590 --> 00:52:20.520
Ah! Oh, no!

1127
00:52:20.560 --> 00:52:22.190
Let's go this way.

1128
00:52:25.730 --> 00:52:27.600
Oh, no!

1129
00:52:29.430 --> 00:52:31.030
C
-Come on.

1130
00:52:31.070 --> 00:52:32.900
Yes.

1131
00:52:32.930 --> 00:52:34.240
Too many of 'em!

1132
00:52:34.270 --> 00:52:35.370
We gotta get
out of here!


1133
00:52:40.910 --> 00:52:42.210
Jack, watch it!

1134
00:52:42.240 --> 00:52:43.240
Watch out!

1135
00:52:43.280 --> 00:52:45.080
Watch out! No!

1136
00:52:46.210 --> 00:52:48.080
Jack!

1137
00:52:52.820 --> 00:52:53.890
Want some of this?

1138
00:52:53.920 --> 00:52:55.920
You got this.
Come on!


1139
00:53:15.010 --> 00:53:16.210
Let's get
out of here.


1140
00:53:16.240 --> 00:53:18.140
Get out of here!

1141
00:53:18.980 --> 00:53:21.110
Though that door.

1142
00:53:36.360 --> 00:53:38.900
Could there
be a prehistoric link
to these spiders?


1143
00:53:38.900 --> 00:53:40.670
That's what's trending
on social media


1144
00:53:40.700 --> 00:53:42.140
after scientific reports

1145
00:53:42.170 --> 00:53:44.640
date these arachnids
back to the Jurassic era.


1146
00:53:44.670 --> 00:53:46.870
Meanwhile, mid-Wilshire
is the latest hot spot,


1147
00:53:46.910 --> 00:53:48.540
where the famed
La Brea Tar Pits


1148
00:53:48.580 --> 00:53:51.380
have been decimated
by dozens of lavalantulas.


1149
00:53:51.410 --> 00:53:54.050
And at the center of it all,
action hero Colton West.


1150
00:53:54.080 --> 00:53:55.880
Colton?
Eyewitnesses say he saved


1151
00:53:55.920 --> 00:53:58.180
dozens of people
on Hollywood Boulevard.


1152
00:54:00.250 --> 00:54:01.990
Doc, you okay?

1153
00:54:02.020 --> 00:54:03.190
You okay?
You hurt?


1154
00:54:03.220 --> 00:54:04.360
What?
Are you hurt?


1155
00:54:04.390 --> 00:54:05.590
Are you
bleeding anywhere?


1156
00:54:05.630 --> 00:54:06.830
I can't hear you!

1157
00:54:06.860 --> 00:54:08.030
I think I lost my hearing.

1158
00:54:08.060 --> 00:54:09.030
No, you didn't.
Huh?


1159
00:54:09.060 --> 00:54:11.060
It's a helicopter!

1160
00:54:14.140 --> 00:54:16.370
Looks like
you're wrapped, kid.


1161
00:54:16.400 --> 00:54:18.370
You're going
back to Des Moines.


1162
00:54:18.410 --> 00:54:19.740
You're not coming with us?

1163
00:54:19.770 --> 00:54:21.210
No. I gotta find my kid.

1164
00:54:21.240 --> 00:54:22.740
I hope you find him.
Yeah.


1165
00:54:22.780 --> 00:54:24.680
I better, or my wife
will kill me.


1166
00:54:24.710 --> 00:54:26.050
You saved my life.

1167
00:54:26.080 --> 00:54:29.120
No. No, no.
We saved each other.


1168
00:54:33.720 --> 00:54:34.750
Kid.
Huh?


1169
00:54:34.790 --> 00:54:35.760
You can let go.
No, no, no.


1170
00:54:35.790 --> 00:54:36.760
Let go of me.

1171
00:54:36.790 --> 00:54:38.260
No. No, no, no.

1172
00:54:38.290 --> 00:54:39.460
Okay.
Okay.


1173
00:54:39.490 --> 00:54:40.560
Go.
Sorry.


1174
00:54:40.590 --> 00:54:41.700
Movie talk.
Movie talk.


1175
00:54:41.730 --> 00:54:43.530
Movie talk.

1176
00:54:43.560 --> 00:54:45.430
You're crazy for staying.

1177
00:54:45.470 --> 00:54:47.100
Yeah, of course
I'm crazy. I'm an actor.


1178
00:54:47.130 --> 00:54:48.540
Good point.

1179
00:54:48.570 --> 00:54:50.970
I printed out a thermal map
of Los Angeles.


1180
00:54:51.010 --> 00:54:53.240
The orange bits
are the lava tubes.


1181
00:54:53.270 --> 00:54:55.210
Stay away from them
if you can.


1182
00:54:55.240 --> 00:54:56.210
Thanks, Doc.

1183
00:54:56.240 --> 00:54:57.280
Be safe.

1184
00:54:57.310 --> 00:54:58.750
Be safe.

1185
00:55:13.260 --> 00:55:14.960
Okay. Okay.

1186
00:55:17.330 --> 00:55:19.800
Come on. Come on. Okay.

1187
00:55:27.540 --> 00:55:28.510
Okay. Okay.

1188
00:55:30.110 --> 00:55:31.850
You want some of this?

1189
00:55:31.880 --> 00:55:34.450
Yeah, come on! Come on!

1190
00:55:34.480 --> 00:55:36.420
It's Christmas.
I got something for you,


1191
00:55:36.450 --> 00:55:38.920
a little present
for you. Come on, guys.


1192
00:55:38.950 --> 00:55:40.290
Come on.

1193
00:55:40.320 --> 00:55:41.820
Colton!

1194
00:55:41.860 --> 00:55:42.860
Get in!

1195
00:55:42.890 --> 00:55:44.020
Ah, honey.

1196
00:55:47.160 --> 00:55:48.630
Come on.
Drive straight.


1197
00:55:48.660 --> 00:55:49.830
Drive straight.

1198
00:55:53.000 --> 00:55:54.300
Okay.

1199
00:55:58.410 --> 00:56:00.340
Ahh!

1200
00:56:04.050 --> 00:56:06.180
What were you doing
at the Tar Pits?


1201
00:56:06.210 --> 00:56:07.880
Trying to find our son.

1202
00:56:07.920 --> 00:56:09.380
I got stuck.

1203
00:56:09.420 --> 00:56:10.880
Stuck?

1204
00:56:10.920 --> 00:56:12.650
Who gets stuck
at the Tar Pits?


1205
00:56:12.690 --> 00:56:14.150
I mean,
Wilshire Boulevard,
really?


1206
00:56:14.190 --> 00:56:15.620
Everyone knows you
take Olympic downtown.


1207
00:56:15.660 --> 00:56:17.390
Thanks, honey.

1208
00:56:17.430 --> 00:56:18.990
You okay?

1209
00:56:19.030 --> 00:56:20.730
Yeah. I'm okay,

1210
00:56:20.760 --> 00:56:23.200
'cause I'm seeing you.

1211
00:56:23.230 --> 00:56:24.860
How'd you find me?

1212
00:56:24.900 --> 00:56:27.470
After 15 years of
putting out your fires,


1213
00:56:27.500 --> 00:56:29.070
I'm gonna just
follow the smoke.


1214
00:56:29.100 --> 00:56:31.240
Really?
No.


1215
00:56:31.270 --> 00:56:32.810
You're all over
the news.


1216
00:56:32.840 --> 00:56:35.710
Ah. So I got
a text from Wyatt.


1217
00:56:35.740 --> 00:56:36.910
He's okay.
You did?


1218
00:56:36.940 --> 00:56:38.180
Yeah.

1219
00:56:38.210 --> 00:56:40.180
He's at Hanson Street
Studios.


1220
00:56:40.210 --> 00:56:42.250
Hanson Street.
Yeah.


1221
00:56:42.280 --> 00:56:43.750
Pretty ironic, huh?
Yeah.


1222
00:56:43.780 --> 00:56:45.050
That's where
we first met.


1223
00:56:45.090 --> 00:56:47.150
Heh.

1224
00:56:47.190 --> 00:56:48.590
You remember?

1225
00:56:48.620 --> 00:56:51.660
Oh, honey, yeah,
of course I remember.


1226
00:56:51.690 --> 00:56:52.890
Really?
Yes.


1227
00:56:52.930 --> 00:56:56.000
That's so romantic.

1228
00:56:56.030 --> 00:56:57.830
I love you, honey.

1229
00:56:57.870 --> 00:56:59.770
I love you, too.

1230
00:56:59.800 --> 00:57:01.900
Let's get downtown.
We'll get Wyatt,


1231
00:57:01.940 --> 00:57:04.270
get the hell out
of this city before it goes.


1232
00:57:06.370 --> 00:57:07.510
Mayday! Mayday!

1233
00:57:07.540 --> 00:57:09.880
This is Evac 670,
Colton West.


1234
00:57:09.910 --> 00:57:12.210
We need help.
This is an emergency.


1235
00:57:12.250 --> 00:57:13.910
Mayday! Mayday!
Please come in.


1236
00:57:15.480 --> 00:57:16.920
Listen. Listen.
They're saying
something.


1237
00:57:16.950 --> 00:57:18.750
The authorities are overwhelmed

1238
00:57:18.790 --> 00:57:20.750
trying to battle these spiders
and evacuate citizens.


1239
00:57:20.790 --> 00:57:23.190
We keep getting new reports
of lavalantulas


1240
00:57:23.220 --> 00:57:25.590
erupting from beneath
the ground, spewing fire,


1241
00:57:25.630 --> 00:57:28.430
and wreaking havoc
all over the Los Angeles basin.


1242
00:57:28.460 --> 00:57:30.460
Nowhere seems to be safe.

1243
00:57:30.500 --> 00:57:32.070
Evacuation efforts
have been halted,


1244
00:57:32.100 --> 00:57:34.530
and everyone is advised
to stay in place--


1245
00:57:34.570 --> 00:57:35.600
I've heard enough.

1246
00:57:54.590 --> 00:57:55.760
Come on.

1247
00:57:59.130 --> 00:58:00.990
Here-
-Here I come, son!

1248
00:58:02.830 --> 00:58:05.130
Stay away from my kid!

1249
00:58:05.170 --> 00:58:08.500
Olivia! Get down, honey!

1250
00:58:08.540 --> 00:58:09.970
Mom! Dad!

1251
00:58:10.000 --> 00:58:11.240
Wyatt, get down!

1252
00:58:11.270 --> 00:58:13.110
Get down!
Wyatt! Get down!


1253
00:58:13.140 --> 00:58:14.870
Get down!

1254
00:58:15.980 --> 00:58:17.680
Oh, my God.

1255
00:58:17.710 --> 00:58:19.380
Are you okay?
Are you okay?


1256
00:58:20.710 --> 00:58:21.680
Honey. Honey.

1257
00:58:21.720 --> 00:58:23.020
Dad!
Ho ho. My boy.


1258
00:58:23.050 --> 00:58:24.150
Mom!

1259
00:58:24.190 --> 00:58:26.320
Oh, thank God.

1260
00:58:30.190 --> 00:58:31.590
Why do you have
a military truck?


1261
00:58:31.630 --> 00:58:33.160
You know your mom.

1262
00:58:33.190 --> 00:58:34.490
She likes
everything big.


1263
00:58:34.530 --> 00:58:35.630
Yes, I do.

1264
00:58:35.660 --> 00:58:37.530
You okay?
Are you all right?


1265
00:58:37.570 --> 00:58:39.170
Did you check yourself?
Are you bleeding anywhere?


1266
00:58:39.200 --> 00:58:40.170
No, I'm good.
I'm good.


1267
00:58:40.200 --> 00:58:41.470
What about
the others?


1268
00:58:41.500 --> 00:58:42.470
Are they okay?

1269
00:58:42.500 --> 00:58:43.970
They didn't make it.

1270
00:58:44.000 --> 00:58:45.040
What?

1271
00:58:45.070 --> 00:58:48.170
I know. I know.

1272
00:58:48.210 --> 00:58:50.540
How on Earth
did you stay alive?


1273
00:58:51.980 --> 00:58:54.450
This.

1274
00:58:54.480 --> 00:58:56.220
It's 'cause I sprayed
them with this,
and they hate it.


1275
00:58:56.250 --> 00:58:57.220
Just a fire
extinguisher?


1276
00:58:57.250 --> 00:58:58.950
No, honey. This is...

1277
00:58:58.990 --> 00:59:00.490
compressed nitrogen.

1278
00:59:00.520 --> 00:59:02.120
Y
-You have more of these?

1279
00:59:02.160 --> 00:59:03.360
That's the last one.

1280
00:59:04.930 --> 00:59:06.160
Nitrogen.

1281
00:59:06.190 --> 00:59:07.230
What?

1282
00:59:07.260 --> 00:59:08.230
There's shops around here.

1283
00:59:08.260 --> 00:59:10.000
Shop?
You want to shop?


1284
00:59:10.030 --> 00:59:12.170
No, honey, this nitrogen,

1285
00:59:12.200 --> 00:59:15.900
this is what almost killed me
this morning on the set.


1286
00:59:15.940 --> 00:59:17.500
This is
gonna keep us alive.


1287
00:59:17.540 --> 00:59:19.670
We gotta get
out of here.
We really gotta go.


1288
00:59:19.710 --> 00:59:22.210
Yeah, and even if we do,
these spiders aren't
just gonna let us leave.


1289
00:59:22.240 --> 00:59:25.580
Dad, we're gonna
have to fight.


1290
00:59:27.050 --> 00:59:29.550
And that's what
we're gonna do, son.


1291
00:59:33.720 --> 00:59:34.890
Come on!

1292
00:59:41.330 --> 00:59:42.970
Ladies and Gentlemen,

1293
00:59:43.000 --> 00:59:45.970
just moments ago, the President
of the United States


1294
00:59:46.000 --> 00:59:49.070
declared the L.A. basin
a disaster zone.


1295
00:59:49.110 --> 00:59:52.470
I can tell you the situation
has gone from bad to worse.


1296
00:59:52.510 --> 00:59:56.080
The Santa Monica Mountains
continue to destabilize.


1297
00:59:56.110 --> 00:59:58.180
We're showing you
live footage from Malibu,


1298
00:59:58.210 --> 01:00:00.020
where the latest eruption
has occurred.


1299
01:00:00.050 --> 01:00:03.190
Several freeways
have been severely damaged,


1300
01:00:03.220 --> 01:00:06.860
leading authorities to advise
everyone to stay in place.


1301
01:00:06.890 --> 01:00:10.830
This map shows the damage
spread across the L.A. basin,


1302
01:00:10.860 --> 01:00:13.060
but in the midst
of all this chaos,


1303
01:00:13.100 --> 01:00:14.860
there are selfless acts
of heroism


1304
01:00:14.900 --> 01:00:16.870
as reported
by our own Lisa Miller.


1305
01:00:16.900 --> 01:00:18.930
Uh, yeah. I just wanna say

1306
01:00:18.970 --> 01:00:21.400
that I wouldn't
be standing here if it
wasn't for Colton West.


1307
01:00:21.440 --> 01:00:23.110
He's a real-life
action hero.


1308
01:00:23.140 --> 01:00:24.870
Well, I'm sure
he had some help.


1309
01:00:24.910 --> 01:00:26.680
Did you know he
used to be an actor?


1310
01:00:26.710 --> 01:00:28.340
Colton West,
he save my life.


1311
01:00:28.380 --> 01:00:30.050
You super action.

1312
01:00:30.080 --> 01:00:31.550
Well, there you have it.

1313
01:00:31.580 --> 01:00:33.450
In the stranger
than fiction category,


1314
01:00:33.480 --> 01:00:35.450
and in the midst of
the biggest catastrophe


1315
01:00:35.490 --> 01:00:37.120
this city
has ever seen,


1316
01:00:37.150 --> 01:00:39.420
a motion-picture
action hero


1317
01:00:39.460 --> 01:00:42.890
might very well be
a real, live
action hero.


1318
01:00:42.930 --> 01:00:43.890
Back to you.

1319
01:00:43.930 --> 01:00:46.430
Thank you, Lisa.
Has he lost his mind?


1320
01:00:46.430 --> 01:00:48.100
Who the hell's
calling here?


1321
01:00:48.130 --> 01:00:50.770
If it's a spider,
don't answer it.


1322
01:00:51.600 --> 01:00:53.740
Who is it?

1323
01:00:53.770 --> 01:00:55.900
It's Colton West.

1324
01:00:55.940 --> 01:00:57.110
What?
What?!


1325
01:00:58.640 --> 01:01:01.280
Wyatt, Olivia,
get in here.
Come in here.


1326
01:01:01.310 --> 01:01:04.210
Oh, Colton.
Colton West, man,


1327
01:01:04.250 --> 01:01:06.380
you are all
over the news.


1328
01:01:06.420 --> 01:01:08.450
Teddy, what are you
still doing here?


1329
01:01:08.480 --> 01:01:10.820
We left the set
same time you did.


1330
01:01:10.850 --> 01:01:12.250
Then all hell
broke loose.


1331
01:01:12.290 --> 01:01:13.890
Freeways
are shut down,


1332
01:01:13.920 --> 01:01:15.760
and those spiders
are killing anything
that moves.


1333
01:01:15.790 --> 01:01:18.260
I know. There's no getting
in and out of L.A. now.


1334
01:01:18.290 --> 01:01:20.160
Well, our boys over
at the studio wings


1335
01:01:20.200 --> 01:01:22.330
said that they have
some helicopters.


1336
01:01:22.370 --> 01:01:23.930
They were supposed
to be on their way,


1337
01:01:23.970 --> 01:01:25.730
but they didn't show up,

1338
01:01:25.770 --> 01:01:28.000
and we haven't
been able to get ahold
of them since.


1339
01:01:28.040 --> 01:01:29.910
Bigger question is,
what are you doing here?


1340
01:01:29.940 --> 01:01:32.410
I got a plan.
Heh heh.


1341
01:01:32.440 --> 01:01:34.910
You've always got
a plan, Colton West.


1342
01:01:34.940 --> 01:01:36.850
Is this the original
Red Rocket?


1343
01:01:36.880 --> 01:01:38.280
Hey, hey, hey,
hey, hey, hey.


1344
01:01:38.310 --> 01:01:40.680
NASA made
that suit.


1345
01:01:40.720 --> 01:01:45.420
Ah, the days
of the big budgets.
Mm, mm, mm.


1346
01:01:45.460 --> 01:01:48.960
Son, this suit, this helmet,
it paid for our house,


1347
01:01:48.990 --> 01:01:51.330
paid for the clothes
you're wearing, your education.


1348
01:01:51.360 --> 01:01:55.430
Paid for everything.

1349
01:01:55.470 --> 01:01:57.270
So why do you
still keep 'em?


1350
01:01:57.300 --> 01:02:00.440
Well--
Because I'm a sucker
for nostalgia.


1351
01:02:00.470 --> 01:02:01.470
Yeah.

1352
01:02:01.500 --> 01:02:03.670
How you doing,
young man?


1353
01:02:03.710 --> 01:02:06.170
I always thought one day
we'd make a sequel.


1354
01:02:06.210 --> 01:02:09.110
Well, if things
ever get normal,
maybe he'll fly again.


1355
01:02:09.150 --> 01:02:10.810
I wish we could all
fly away from here.


1356
01:02:10.850 --> 01:02:14.020
We're gonna make a break
for it, Colt. You with us?


1357
01:02:14.050 --> 01:02:15.380
No. You're not
going out there.


1358
01:02:15.420 --> 01:02:16.990
I wouldn't count
on the military.


1359
01:02:17.020 --> 01:02:18.720
They're sending in
a ground evac,


1360
01:02:18.760 --> 01:02:20.620
but who knows when
that's gonna happen?


1361
01:02:20.660 --> 01:02:22.220
So we're all
just sitting ducks?


1362
01:02:22.260 --> 01:02:24.690
No, Ted,
I'm not a sitting duck,


1363
01:02:24.730 --> 01:02:26.730
and neither are you.
We're not giving up.


1364
01:02:26.760 --> 01:02:29.800
I love your attitude,
baby, but the fact is--


1365
01:02:29.830 --> 01:02:31.530
Marty, I've been
in this town for 30 years.


1366
01:02:31.570 --> 01:02:33.700
It has not killed me.
It's not gonna kill me now.


1367
01:02:33.740 --> 01:02:36.870
Now, Wyatt said
this kept him alive.


1368
01:02:36.910 --> 01:02:39.640
Nitrogen. You used it
on the set today,
weren't you?


1369
01:02:39.680 --> 01:02:42.310
You used this on them?

1370
01:02:42.350 --> 01:02:44.010
Yeah.
It worked?


1371
01:02:44.050 --> 01:02:45.350
Son of a gun.

1372
01:02:45.380 --> 01:02:46.750
Do you have
any more?


1373
01:02:46.780 --> 01:02:49.080
How much
are we talking?


1374
01:02:49.120 --> 01:02:50.750
And what do you have
in mind, Colt?


1375
01:02:50.790 --> 01:02:53.620
I need a map of downtown.

1376
01:02:56.360 --> 01:02:58.890
All right.
This is their nest.


1377
01:02:58.930 --> 01:03:00.400
This is how
they get around.


1378
01:03:00.430 --> 01:03:02.500
This is where
they come out.


1379
01:03:02.530 --> 01:03:04.430
It's all over L.A.

1380
01:03:04.470 --> 01:03:07.400
Right here,
this large chamber,


1381
01:03:07.440 --> 01:03:10.570
that's where
the queen is.


1382
01:03:12.110 --> 01:03:13.880
Okay.

1383
01:03:13.910 --> 01:03:15.940
If this map is accurate--
and it is--


1384
01:03:15.980 --> 01:03:17.510
that's no more than
just a few blocks away.


1385
01:03:17.550 --> 01:03:18.750
That's right.

1386
01:03:18.780 --> 01:03:21.220
Those canisters
of liquid nitrogen,


1387
01:03:21.250 --> 01:03:26.050
we need to wrap
bombs around them.
Can you do that?


1388
01:03:26.090 --> 01:03:28.760
I still have
a few dozen sticks
of C-4 around.


1389
01:03:28.790 --> 01:03:30.730
I don't see that
as a problem.


1390
01:03:30.760 --> 01:03:34.260
And we could
detonate them
by remote.


1391
01:03:34.300 --> 01:03:35.860
Can you do that?

1392
01:03:35.900 --> 01:03:37.930
Not a problem.

1393
01:03:37.970 --> 01:03:39.870
If we make enough
of these canisters


1394
01:03:39.900 --> 01:03:43.610
and drop them down
in the open craters,


1395
01:03:43.640 --> 01:03:45.610
then we can
detonate them,


1396
01:03:45.640 --> 01:03:49.780
and we can smoke
this queen right
out of the nest.


1397
01:03:49.810 --> 01:03:51.310
Can you do that?

1398
01:03:51.350 --> 01:03:53.650
Not a problem.
Not a problem.


1399
01:03:53.680 --> 01:03:56.650
I--I don't know much
about this sort
of thing,


1400
01:03:56.690 --> 01:03:58.420
but this queen,

1401
01:03:58.450 --> 01:04:00.420
she's gonna be
a lot bigger than
the others, right?


1402
01:04:00.460 --> 01:04:02.090
Yeah,
she's gonna be huge.


1403
01:04:02.130 --> 01:04:04.260
And really pissed.

1404
01:04:04.290 --> 01:04:06.500
So, what,
we kill the queen?


1405
01:04:06.530 --> 01:04:08.460
Where does that
even get us?


1406
01:04:08.500 --> 01:04:10.170
Oh, no, no.
What--What he's saying,


1407
01:04:10.200 --> 01:04:11.830
it's--it's
a hive mentality.


1408
01:04:11.870 --> 01:04:14.270
You see, um,
if you kill the queen,


1409
01:04:14.300 --> 01:04:16.000
you kill them all.

1410
01:04:16.040 --> 01:04:18.170
It's--It's like
on the Insect Channel.


1411
01:04:18.210 --> 01:04:19.610
That's right.

1412
01:04:19.640 --> 01:04:22.580
I hate bugs.

1413
01:04:22.610 --> 01:04:24.850
Let's kill the bitch.

1414
01:04:36.360 --> 01:04:38.090
Ladies and gentlemen,

1415
01:04:38.130 --> 01:04:40.700
tonight I call upon you,

1416
01:04:40.730 --> 01:04:43.470
the good people
of the motion picture industry.


1417
01:04:43.500 --> 01:04:46.870
It is you who works tirelessly

1418
01:04:46.900 --> 01:04:51.270
12, 14, 16 hours a day...

1419
01:04:51.310 --> 01:04:54.810
giving pints and pints of
your blood for our great nation.


1420
01:04:54.840 --> 01:04:58.480
Yes, some might say
it's just entertainment,


1421
01:04:58.510 --> 01:05:00.220
but we know better.

1422
01:05:00.250 --> 01:05:02.150
Our movies are where
the hopes and dreams


1423
01:05:02.190 --> 01:05:04.490
of this great nation are born.

1424
01:05:04.520 --> 01:05:07.890
Ladies and gentlemen,
I'm chagrined to say


1425
01:05:07.920 --> 01:05:10.390
that tonight might be
our last production,


1426
01:05:10.430 --> 01:05:12.890
but I beseech you,
please think another way.


1427
01:05:12.930 --> 01:05:16.030
Tonight is our opening night.

1428
01:05:16.070 --> 01:05:18.630
Tonight is the night
that we save our city,


1429
01:05:18.670 --> 01:05:22.040
our homes, our families,

1430
01:05:22.070 --> 01:05:24.340
that we believe in a tomorrow,

1431
01:05:24.370 --> 01:05:26.910
a tomorrow where the Lakers
have another threepeat.


1432
01:05:26.940 --> 01:05:28.180
What about
the Clippers?


1433
01:05:28.210 --> 01:05:29.980
Clippers, too.

1434
01:05:30.010 --> 01:05:34.550
A tomorrow where the Kings
sip again from the Stanley Cup.


1435
01:05:34.580 --> 01:05:36.150
What about
the Ducks?


1436
01:05:36.190 --> 01:05:37.920
The Ducks, too.

1437
01:05:37.950 --> 01:05:39.320
And a tomorrow
where the Dodgers,


1438
01:05:39.360 --> 01:05:43.230
only the Dodgers,
win the World Series.


1439
01:05:43.260 --> 01:05:45.230
Ladies and gentlemen,

1440
01:05:45.260 --> 01:05:48.700
tonight I ask you
to unify as a city,


1441
01:05:48.730 --> 01:05:51.030
above the line, below the line.

1442
01:05:51.070 --> 01:05:53.370
Tonight we draw the line.

1443
01:05:53.400 --> 01:05:54.840
This is your city.

1444
01:05:54.870 --> 01:05:55.870
This is my city.

1445
01:05:55.910 --> 01:05:57.410
I was born in this city.

1446
01:05:57.440 --> 01:06:00.110
I'm gonna die in this city,
but not tonight!


1447
01:06:00.140 --> 01:06:02.610
Viva Los Angelenos!

1448
01:06:04.880 --> 01:06:06.410
Viva Los Angelenos!

1449
01:06:06.450 --> 01:06:09.680
Yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah, baby!


1450
01:06:09.720 --> 01:06:11.790
Yeah, that's what I'm
talking about, man!


1451
01:06:13.890 --> 01:06:15.790
Whoo! Whoo!

1452
01:06:19.030 --> 01:06:20.500
Al i run it off.
Okay.


1453
01:06:20.530 --> 01:06:21.730
All right.
I got this.


1454
01:06:21.760 --> 01:06:23.270
Colt. Colt.
Yeah, Marty.


1455
01:06:23.300 --> 01:06:24.470
Yeah.
Listen.


1456
01:06:24.500 --> 01:06:25.830
I've been thinking
about this.


1457
01:06:25.870 --> 01:06:27.470
Mm-hmm. Yeah?
The queen.


1458
01:06:27.500 --> 01:06:29.740
You've gotta get
really close to take her out,


1459
01:06:29.770 --> 01:06:32.410
and bullets
aren't gonna do it.


1460
01:06:32.440 --> 01:06:34.010
You need an explosion,

1461
01:06:34.040 --> 01:06:36.180
and you know what happens
if she explodes?


1462
01:06:36.210 --> 01:06:38.110
It's a death wish
for anyone nearby.


1463
01:06:38.150 --> 01:06:40.080
Okay. So let's
use a remote.


1464
01:06:40.120 --> 01:06:42.150
It's moving,
and it's very hot.


1465
01:06:42.180 --> 01:06:43.790
Who's gonna
slap it on, anyway?


1466
01:06:43.820 --> 01:06:45.350
And besides, remember,
this is C-4.


1467
01:06:45.390 --> 01:06:47.290
That stuff's
gonna go off by itself,


1468
01:06:47.320 --> 01:06:49.160
like it or not.
So how long?


1469
01:06:49.190 --> 01:06:52.690
10, 20 seconds tops.

1470
01:06:52.730 --> 01:06:54.500
Look, man, that was
a really good speech,


1471
01:06:54.530 --> 01:06:56.970
but, um--oh, oh,
okay, great speech,


1472
01:06:57.000 --> 01:06:59.330
but we're gonna need
more than speeches.


1473
01:06:59.370 --> 01:07:02.470
Just make sure
those bombs go off.


1474
01:07:02.510 --> 01:07:04.470
Oh, we will.

1475
01:07:09.210 --> 01:07:12.880
You both just stay
here, and you'll
be safe, okay?


1476
01:07:12.920 --> 01:07:14.980
Okay.
And, Wyatt,


1477
01:07:15.020 --> 01:07:16.950
I'm counting
on you, okay?


1478
01:07:16.990 --> 01:07:18.620
Okay.
You be a good boy.


1479
01:07:18.650 --> 01:07:19.620
I will.

1480
01:07:19.660 --> 01:07:21.360
You watch your mother.

1481
01:07:21.390 --> 01:07:22.860
All right.

1482
01:07:22.890 --> 01:07:24.830
Promise me
you'll come back.


1483
01:07:24.860 --> 01:07:26.160
I promise.

1484
01:07:26.200 --> 01:07:28.800
Okay.

1485
01:07:28.830 --> 01:07:31.100
Don't worry.

1486
01:07:34.570 --> 01:07:36.140
And how 'bout you?

1487
01:07:36.170 --> 01:07:38.370
You want to go
to a Dodger game
when I come back?


1488
01:07:38.410 --> 01:07:39.640
Yeah.

1489
01:07:39.680 --> 01:07:41.340
Hate to interrupt
a family moment,


1490
01:07:41.380 --> 01:07:43.240
but it's go time.

1491
01:07:43.280 --> 01:07:45.210
Okay.
Okay.


1492
01:07:45.250 --> 01:07:46.250
All right.

1493
01:07:48.720 --> 01:07:50.050
I love you.

1494
01:07:51.450 --> 01:07:53.020
It's gonna be okay.

1495
01:08:04.930 --> 01:08:07.570
This is alpha.
We are nearing
the first drop.


1496
01:08:13.380 --> 01:08:15.340
The first bomb is away.

1497
01:08:21.250 --> 01:08:23.020
Roger that.
This is Bravo team.


1498
01:08:23.050 --> 01:08:24.750
We're nearing
the second crater.


1499
01:08:32.330 --> 01:08:34.100
Two is away.
Repeat, two is away.


1500
01:08:34.130 --> 01:08:35.730
We'll show them,
stupid spider,


1501
01:08:35.770 --> 01:08:38.270
good kung fu
fighting technique.


1502
01:08:38.300 --> 01:08:40.900
It is eerily quiet
on the streets of Los Angeles


1503
01:08:40.940 --> 01:08:43.540
as the greater
metro area smolders


1504
01:08:43.570 --> 01:08:45.940
under the crippling
volcanic eruptions


1505
01:08:45.980 --> 01:08:48.310
and the onslaught
of lavalantulas


1506
01:08:48.340 --> 01:08:50.310
that have been thrust up
from their nest,


1507
01:08:50.350 --> 01:08:52.250
decimating everything
in their path.


1508
01:08:52.280 --> 01:08:54.420
Now the residents
that were evacuated earlier


1509
01:08:54.450 --> 01:08:56.750
are long gone,
hopefully to safety.


1510
01:08:56.790 --> 01:09:00.720
Those who remain are
hunkered down under martial law.


1511
01:09:00.760 --> 01:09:02.890
Let me tell you,
even though this small area


1512
01:09:02.930 --> 01:09:04.490
might seem safe for now,

1513
01:09:04.530 --> 01:09:07.760
no one inside the city
and the ring of fire are safe.


1514
01:09:07.800 --> 01:09:10.430
Rescue efforts are
still being hindered,


1515
01:09:10.470 --> 01:09:12.170
so all of these brave residents,

1516
01:09:12.200 --> 01:09:15.270
all they can do is
sit and wait and pray.


1517
01:09:18.310 --> 01:09:20.280
Keep it moving.
Keep it moving.


1518
01:09:31.120 --> 01:09:32.950
Hey, man, I'm gonna
need some backup.


1519
01:09:32.990 --> 01:09:34.820
There's lots
of spiders here.


1520
01:09:34.860 --> 01:09:37.260
Don't worry, Teddy.
Cavalry's
on its way.


1521
01:09:45.800 --> 01:09:48.100
All right, now.

1522
01:09:48.140 --> 01:09:49.800
I'm here. Come on!

1523
01:09:49.840 --> 01:09:52.040
Come on! Come on!

1524
01:09:52.070 --> 01:09:55.180
I got something
for you and your mama!


1525
01:09:55.210 --> 01:09:57.980
Take that! Come on!

1526
01:10:01.380 --> 01:10:03.850
Ah! Ah!

1527
01:10:06.020 --> 01:10:07.120
I need some help here.

1528
01:10:07.160 --> 01:10:09.220
I need some help!

1529
01:10:09.260 --> 01:10:10.860
Full power.

1530
01:10:15.230 --> 01:10:17.370
Oh.

1531
01:10:17.400 --> 01:10:18.600
Oh.

1532
01:10:20.600 --> 01:10:22.200
Hoo.

1533
01:10:26.180 --> 01:10:27.340
Move it! Move it!
Oh, guys...


1534
01:10:28.510 --> 01:10:30.040
Come on,
come on, come on!


1535
01:10:30.080 --> 01:10:31.080
Teddy.
Come on!


1536
01:10:33.250 --> 01:10:34.280
Come on.

1537
01:10:35.720 --> 01:10:37.950
Come on,
you suckers.


1538
01:10:39.860 --> 01:10:41.920
Come on.
Come on. Come on.


1539
01:10:50.700 --> 01:10:52.370
What?
They're gone.


1540
01:10:52.400 --> 01:10:54.240
Well, it worked,
didn't it?


1541
01:10:54.270 --> 01:10:55.870
Yeah.

1542
01:10:55.910 --> 01:10:57.570
Okay.
What's the plan, Colt?


1543
01:10:57.610 --> 01:10:59.170
Uh, you know
how we always say


1544
01:10:59.210 --> 01:11:01.540
that making a film
is like war?


1545
01:11:01.580 --> 01:11:03.240
Yeah.
Yeah.


1546
01:11:03.280 --> 01:11:05.880
Well, let's hope that this war
is like making a film.


1547
01:11:05.920 --> 01:11:07.220
What does that mean?

1548
01:11:07.250 --> 01:11:08.350
Means I need you
to plant those bombs.


1549
01:11:08.380 --> 01:11:09.850
Okay, but what
does that mean?


1550
01:11:09.890 --> 01:11:11.450
Means I need you
to plant those bombs.


1551
01:11:11.490 --> 01:11:13.590
Where are you going?
What are you doing?
Colton!


1552
01:11:13.620 --> 01:11:16.790
Colt! Come back here, Colt .44!
Come back here!


1553
01:11:16.830 --> 01:11:19.390
Uh, your attention please.
Colton has gone rogue.


1554
01:11:19.430 --> 01:11:22.100
Everybody keep going.
The plan remains the same.


1555
01:11:22.130 --> 01:11:24.230
Repeat, it remains
the same, all right? Out.


1556
01:11:24.270 --> 01:11:25.800
What is he doing?

1557
01:11:25.830 --> 01:11:28.140
He's just being
your father.
I don't--


1558
01:11:28.170 --> 01:11:30.910
Keep moving, laddies.
We've got to win this one.


1559
01:11:30.940 --> 01:11:32.640
Freedom!

1560
01:12:28.230 --> 01:12:29.230
Damn it!

1561
01:12:52.090 --> 01:12:55.320
Marty. Marty.
Come in, Marty.


1562
01:12:55.360 --> 01:12:57.130
There you are, man.

1563
01:12:57.160 --> 01:12:59.530
Hey, where are you?
Exactly where are you?


1564
01:12:59.560 --> 01:13:02.560
You'll know in a little bit.

1565
01:13:02.600 --> 01:13:03.830
What's our status?

1566
01:13:03.870 --> 01:13:05.530
You got
those bombs planted?


1567
01:13:05.570 --> 01:13:06.570
Red 3 standing by.

1568
01:13:06.600 --> 01:13:08.140
Red 2 standing by.

1569
01:13:08.170 --> 01:13:09.700
Red 5 standing by.

1570
01:13:09.740 --> 01:13:11.370
R2, shut up.
I'm busy, man.


1571
01:13:11.410 --> 01:13:12.810
Standing by, man.
Great.


1572
01:13:12.840 --> 01:13:14.740
I'm counting on you,
Marty.


1573
01:13:14.780 --> 01:13:17.210
I'm counting on you.

1574
01:13:17.250 --> 01:13:18.680
We gonna be
all right, Colt.


1575
01:13:18.710 --> 01:13:20.580
You just make sure
you don't get dead.


1576
01:13:35.260 --> 01:13:38.000
Colt, I really hope
you're there,


1577
01:13:38.030 --> 01:13:40.100
'cause if you've got a plan,
now's the time.


1578
01:13:40.140 --> 01:13:42.000
Yeah, I got a plan.

1579
01:13:42.040 --> 01:13:43.100
It's go time.

1580
01:13:43.140 --> 01:13:45.370
Go time?
Go where time?


1581
01:13:45.410 --> 01:13:46.770
What-
-Where are you?

1582
01:13:46.810 --> 01:13:49.410
I found a little party
I want to drop in on.


1583
01:14:00.660 --> 01:14:02.060
Make some music, Teddy.

1584
01:14:02.090 --> 01:14:05.860
On my mark,

1585
01:14:05.890 --> 01:14:07.330
We're rolling.

1586
01:14:21.680 --> 01:14:23.280
Oh.

1587
01:14:25.310 --> 01:14:26.880
One didn't go off.

1588
01:14:26.920 --> 01:14:28.080
Push it again.

1589
01:14:28.120 --> 01:14:29.080
I'm pushing it.

1590
01:14:30.950 --> 01:14:31.920
Oh, my gosh.

1591
01:14:31.950 --> 01:14:34.990
Oh, my...

1592
01:14:36.490 --> 01:14:37.830
Load up.
Load up.


1593
01:14:37.860 --> 01:14:41.000
- Yah!
- What the...


1594
01:14:41.030 --> 01:14:42.100
Yah!

1595
01:14:42.130 --> 01:14:43.660
Incoming!

1596
01:14:43.700 --> 01:14:45.770
Incoming!
Let's go! Go! Go! Go!


1597
01:14:45.800 --> 01:14:46.900
Go!
Take 'em out!


1598
01:14:48.370 --> 01:14:50.300
Over there.
Tighten the flank!


1599
01:14:50.340 --> 01:14:52.240
Tighten the flank!
Don't let 'em through!


1600
01:14:52.270 --> 01:14:53.780
Hold 'em!

1601
01:14:53.810 --> 01:14:55.140
Back up. Back up!
Hold the line.


1602
01:14:55.180 --> 01:14:57.910
Come on.
Hold the line!


1603
01:14:57.950 --> 01:14:59.780
Watch your flank!
Watch your flank, guys!


1604
01:14:59.820 --> 01:15:01.680
Tighten it up!
Tighten it up!


1605
01:15:01.720 --> 01:15:03.550
That's it! Spray 'em!

1606
01:15:12.530 --> 01:15:14.760
Ah...

1607
01:15:14.800 --> 01:15:17.670
What we gonna do?
How am I gonna spray that, man?


1608
01:15:17.700 --> 01:15:18.930
She's bigger than
the damn buildings.


1609
01:15:18.970 --> 01:15:21.070
Mama's home.

1610
01:15:23.570 --> 01:15:28.140
If anybody's got a Plan B,
uh, how 'bout now?


1611
01:15:33.520 --> 01:15:36.980
She's not just bad.
She's big.


1612
01:15:37.020 --> 01:15:38.220
Really big.

1613
01:15:42.660 --> 01:15:43.790
C-4 now.

1614
01:15:43.830 --> 01:15:46.330
Oh, you're kidding me.
What?


1615
01:15:46.360 --> 01:15:47.900
Where the hell is it?

1616
01:15:47.930 --> 01:15:50.360
I know where it is.

1617
01:16:00.540 --> 01:16:02.340
All right, Colt.

1618
01:16:02.380 --> 01:16:03.740
Action.

1619
01:16:03.780 --> 01:16:05.310
Unbelievable.

1620
01:16:05.350 --> 01:16:07.650
Let's hope this works.

1621
01:16:10.550 --> 01:16:11.550
Whoa!

1622
01:16:14.220 --> 01:16:15.490
Go! Go!
Let's go!


1623
01:16:15.520 --> 01:16:17.330
Go! Go!
Get out of here!


1624
01:16:17.360 --> 01:16:18.790
Run! Run!
Everybody, run!


1625
01:16:25.300 --> 01:16:26.400
No. No, no, no!
No, no, no!


1626
01:16:26.440 --> 01:16:28.170
Whoa! Ow!

1627
01:16:28.200 --> 01:16:29.770
Ow! Ow!

1628
01:16:33.110 --> 01:16:34.710
Steady. Come on, steady.

1629
01:16:34.740 --> 01:16:35.940
Whoa. Ow! Whoa. Whoa, whoa.

1630
01:16:35.980 --> 01:16:37.980
Ow!

1631
01:16:43.620 --> 01:16:44.950
Oh ho. Okay.

1632
01:16:46.660 --> 01:16:49.220
Ooh.

1633
01:16:49.260 --> 01:16:50.420
Aah! Whoo!

1634
01:16:50.460 --> 01:16:51.890
Whoo-hoo-hoo!
That's hot!


1635
01:16:51.930 --> 01:16:52.990
Ow!

1636
01:16:55.160 --> 01:16:57.230
Hi, baby.

1637
01:17:05.240 --> 01:17:07.510
Nice mouth.

1638
01:17:19.350 --> 01:17:21.060
And in breaking news,

1639
01:17:21.090 --> 01:17:23.060
while airlifts
are finally under way,


1640
01:17:23.090 --> 01:17:26.660
evacuating the rest
of the civilians from the area,


1641
01:17:26.700 --> 01:17:30.100
one man and his ragtag team of--
and you're hearing this right--


1642
01:17:30.130 --> 01:17:33.400
film crew actually
devised a successful plan


1643
01:17:33.440 --> 01:17:35.400
to take down
the queen lavalantula


1644
01:17:35.440 --> 01:17:37.440
and send the rest
of these creatures back down


1645
01:17:37.470 --> 01:17:40.940
to their fiery home thousands
of feet below the city.


1646
01:17:40.980 --> 01:17:43.410
That hero is none other
than Colton West,


1647
01:17:43.450 --> 01:17:46.650
who, against all odds,
risked life and limb


1648
01:17:46.680 --> 01:17:48.780
to save this still great city.

1649
01:17:48.820 --> 01:17:51.120
And all that this reporter
can say,


1650
01:17:51.150 --> 01:17:54.760
in the now infamous words
of Colton West, is nice job.


1651
01:18:04.470 --> 01:18:08.040
Oh, hey, buddy.
Come on. Come on.


1652
01:18:08.070 --> 01:18:09.040
Over here.

1653
01:18:09.070 --> 01:18:10.340
Hey, come on. Oh.

1654
01:18:10.370 --> 01:18:11.970
Come on.
Come on. We got you.


1655
01:18:12.010 --> 01:18:13.340
Oh, thank you.
We got you.


1656
01:18:13.380 --> 01:18:14.510
Ho ho ho. Step up.

1657
01:18:14.540 --> 01:18:16.440
You all right?
Yeah.


1658
01:18:16.480 --> 01:18:18.610
You still--Oh, yeah.
Aw, man. Ow!


1659
01:18:18.650 --> 01:18:19.810
Nice suit.
Yeah.


1660
01:18:19.850 --> 01:18:21.720
I'm really glad
you kept it.


1661
01:18:21.750 --> 01:18:23.550
You're welcome.
You're welcome.


1662
01:18:24.820 --> 01:18:26.450
Dad!

1663
01:18:26.490 --> 01:18:28.790
Dad! Dad! Dad!

1664
01:18:28.820 --> 01:18:30.290
I'm fine, my son.

1665
01:18:30.330 --> 01:18:32.130
Dad, I was watching
the news the whole time,


1666
01:18:32.160 --> 01:18:33.660
It was so cool!
My good boy.


1667
01:18:33.700 --> 01:18:34.730
Oh, he's a good boy.

1668
01:18:34.760 --> 01:18:36.630
You are crazy.
Oh, yeah.


1669
01:18:36.670 --> 01:18:38.330
You know that?
Oh, yeah.


1670
01:18:38.370 --> 01:18:39.900
Honey, I really hurt.
I think I broke--


1671
01:18:39.940 --> 01:18:41.640
Come on. Come on.
I think I broke my face.


1672
01:18:41.670 --> 01:18:42.970
Get him out of here.

1673
01:18:43.010 --> 01:18:44.570
Oh, I think--I gotta
go to the hospital.


1674
01:18:44.610 --> 01:18:45.670
But, Dad...
Yeah?


1675
01:18:45.710 --> 01:18:46.910
Dad, you did it.
Yeah. Yeah.


1676
01:18:46.940 --> 01:18:48.040
The West family did it.

1677
01:18:48.080 --> 01:18:49.140
Yeah, we did it.
We all did.


1678
01:18:49.180 --> 01:18:50.710
I think I did
a lot of it,


1679
01:18:50.750 --> 01:18:52.210
but I think
we did it together.


1680
01:18:52.250 --> 01:18:55.080
I smell a sequel
coming on.


1681
01:18:55.120 --> 01:18:57.390
"Red Rocket 2"?

1682
01:18:57.420 --> 01:18:58.720
"Attack
of the Lavalantulas."


1683
01:18:58.750 --> 01:18:59.720
Ah.

1684
01:18:59.760 --> 01:19:00.720
Everybody gets a suit.

1685
01:19:00.760 --> 01:19:01.890
I want a suit.

1686
01:19:01.920 --> 01:19:03.660
Well, you could
put me in mine.


1687
01:19:03.690 --> 01:19:04.890
Ooh, I like that.

1688
01:19:04.930 --> 01:19:06.230
Oh, yeah, baby.

1689
01:19:07.630 --> 01:19:08.600
Yeah. Aw, yeah.

1690
01:19:08.630 --> 01:19:10.930
Aw, yeah, baby.

1691
01:19:10.970 --> 01:19:12.730
♪ Red Rocket
in the house, yo ♪


1692
01:19:12.770 --> 01:19:15.000
We thinking about
all kinds of Red
Rocket products.


1693
01:19:15.040 --> 01:19:16.240
Yeah.
Red Rocket tacos.


1694
01:19:16.270 --> 01:19:18.070
Red Rocket lipstick.

1695
01:19:18.110 --> 01:19:19.370
Red Rocket lipstick.

1696
01:19:19.410 --> 01:19:21.010
Red Rocket burritos,
Red-ritos.


1697
01:19:21.040 --> 01:19:22.680
Red Rocket shoes.
Ha ha ha ha.


1698
01:19:22.710 --> 01:19:23.940
Red Rocket rockets.

1699
01:19:23.980 --> 01:19:25.950
Red Rocket rockets.
Y-Yeah.


1700
01:19:25.980 --> 01:19:29.750
...against the Mamalantula
and lavalantulas


1701
01:19:29.790 --> 01:19:33.220
have brought an end to
a chaotic and terrifying day.


1702
01:19:33.260 --> 01:19:34.960
But many wonder aloud

1703
01:19:34.990 --> 01:19:38.030
if this is the last
we've seen of the lavalantulas.
