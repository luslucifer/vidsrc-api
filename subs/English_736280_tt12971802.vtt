1931
01:35:22.986 --> 01:35:24.654
But it was her partner

1932
01:35:24.738 --> 01:35:27.866
who persuaded me
that I-I should do the show.


1933
01:35:27.949 --> 01:35:29.284
(imitating Desi):
He said, "We gonna make


1934
01:35:29.367 --> 01:35:32.287
the best damn television show
on television."

(laughter)

1936
01:35:34.998 --> 01:35:37.375
He wanted to be here tonight.

1937
01:35:37.459 --> 01:35:40.295
I'd like to read something that he wrote.

1938
01:35:42.297 --> 01:35:44.674
<i>"I Love Lucy</i> had just one mission:

1939
01:35:44.758 --> 01:35:46.927
"to make people laugh.

1940
01:35:47.010 --> 01:35:49.638
"Lucy gave it a rare quality.

"She can perform the wildest,
even the messiest


1942
01:35:52.098 --> 01:35:55.268
"physical comedy without
losing her feminine appeal.


1943
01:35:55.352 --> 01:35:58.271
<i>"The New York Times</i>
asked me to divide the credit


1944
01:35:58.355 --> 01:36:01.775
"for its success between the writers,
the directors and the cast.


1945
01:36:01.858 --> 01:36:06.696
"I told them, '
Give Lucy 90% of the credit

1946
01:36:06.780 --> 01:36:09.824
and divide the other ten percent
among the rest of us.'"


1947
01:36:09.908 --> 01:36:14.246
Desi concluded, "Lucy was the show.

1948
01:36:14.329 --> 01:36:16.665
"Viv and Fred and I were just props--

1949
01:36:16.748 --> 01:36:20.961
"damn good props, but props nevertheless.

LUCY (over speakers):
Some people in this industry


1956
01:37:09.634 --> 01:37:11.094
are still saying,
"We got to get big stars.

We got to get big stars."
