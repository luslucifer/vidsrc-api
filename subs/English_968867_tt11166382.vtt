00:01:17.058 --> 00:01:19.626
<i>In October of 1979,</i>

2
00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:22.362
<i>a death row inmate</i>
<i>named Jack Harding</i>


3
00:01:22.395 --> 00:01:23.931
<i>escaped police custody</i>

4
00:01:23.965 --> 00:01:26.500
<i>and proceeded to go</i>
<i>on a killing spree</i>


5
00:01:26.533 --> 00:01:30.303
<i>in the sleepy farming community</i>
<i>of Hackleburg, Alabama.</i>


6
00:01:39.513 --> 00:01:41.783
You're saying that you think
he's still alive, don't you?


7
00:01:41.816 --> 00:01:43.483
I know he is.

8
00:01:43.517 --> 00:01:46.286
<i>He would seemingly appear</i>
<i>from thin air,</i>


9
00:01:46.386 --> 00:01:50.624
<i>a force of nature empowered</i>
<i>by the onset of autumn.</i>


10
00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:55.029
You and this town is linin' up

11
00:01:55.062 --> 00:01:58.065
for a third Saturday in October
slaughterhouse!


12
00:01:58.099 --> 00:02:00.500
Stop, please! Stop!

13
00:02:02.904 --> 00:02:04.839
Stop! Stop!

14
00:02:06.841 --> 00:02:08.743
<i>He would return</i>
<i>to haunt Hackleburg</i>


15
00:02:08.776 --> 00:02:11.712
<i>three more times</i>
<i>throughout the 1980s,</i>


16
00:02:11.746 --> 00:02:15.716
<i>continuously defying death</i>
<i>as he left a trail of carnage</i>


17
00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:16.951
<i>in his wake.</i>

18
00:02:17.051 --> 00:02:18.686
Are you even in there?

19
00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:24.725
<i>His victims</i>
<i>would be young and old</i>


20
00:02:24.759 --> 00:02:27.695
<i>with no regard for the</i>
<i>innocence of human life.</i>


21
00:02:30.397 --> 00:02:31.732
This game
is fucking impossible.


22
00:02:31.766 --> 00:02:32.733
Baby.

23
00:02:34.802 --> 00:02:36.636
Is this really what you
wanna be doing right now?


24
00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:38.638
Stop,
you're gonna get me killed.


25
00:02:38.672 --> 00:02:40.107
You don't wanna see my tits?

26
00:02:40.141 --> 00:02:41.675
Not right now.

27
00:02:42.009 --> 00:02:43.510
Baby, come on.

28
00:02:44.611 --> 00:02:46.013
He's usually
all over the place.


29
00:02:46.047 --> 00:02:48.816
More like all over me.

30
00:02:56.791 --> 00:02:59.426
<i>After an attack in 1987,</i>

31
00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:01.628
<i>Harding vanished</i>
<i>without a trace.</i>


32
00:03:01.661 --> 00:03:03.430
<i>And for the past six years,</i>

33
00:03:03.463 --> 00:03:05.766
<i>the residents of Hackleburg</i>
<i>have made it through</i>


34
00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:09.036
<i>the third Saturday in October</i>
<i>without incident.</i>


35
00:03:09.203 --> 00:03:11.739
<i>This year however,</i>
<i>they are about to see</i>


36
00:03:11.772 --> 00:03:14.075
<i>some real crazy shit.</i>

37
00:03:29.757 --> 00:03:32.492
<i>...107.7</i>

38
00:03:32.525 --> 00:03:34.896
<i>Alabama sports radio...</i>

39
00:03:34.929 --> 00:03:36.563
<i>Reports out of Mobile tell us</i>

40
00:03:36.596 --> 00:03:39.867
<i>that receivers and backup</i>
<i>quarterback Tex Coorley</i>


41
00:03:39.901 --> 00:03:41.936
<i>were out on the practice</i>
<i>field this evenin'.</i>


42
00:03:41.969 --> 00:03:45.572
<i>Now, all I can make of this is</i>
<i>that Coach Redd just found out</i>


43
00:03:45.605 --> 00:03:47.208
<i>Nate Barker</i>
<i>can't play tomorrow.</i>


44
00:03:47.241 --> 00:03:48.309
<i>Oh, that's ridiculous.</i>

45
00:03:48.342 --> 00:03:50.510
<i>Coach Redd wouldn't</i>
<i>advertise it to the world</i>


46
00:03:50.543 --> 00:03:52.612
<i>if his starting quarterback</i>
<i>couldn't play.</i>


47
00:03:52.646 --> 00:03:55.816
<i>This is the old ball coach</i>
<i>tryin' to mess with A&M</i>


48
00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:57.617
<i>and head coach Manny Parish.</i>

49
00:03:57.651 --> 00:03:59.053
<i>Nothin' more, nothin' less.</i>

50
00:04:50.637 --> 00:04:53.540
<i>You disrespected me!</i>
<i>That was inappropriate dancin'!</i>


51
00:04:53.573 --> 00:04:54.607
<i>There ain't no ifs,</i>
<i>ands or buts about it.</i>


52
00:04:54.641 --> 00:04:56.543
<i>Ugh, I swear, Ronnie,</i>
<i>if you don't shut up,</i>


53
00:04:56.576 --> 00:04:57.945
<i>I'm gonna stay</i>
<i>at my mama's house tonight.</i>


54
00:04:57.979 --> 00:04:59.679
I know where
you wanna sleep tonight


55
00:04:59.714 --> 00:05:00.815
<i>and it sure as hell</i>
<i>ain't your mama's house.</i>


56
00:05:00.848 --> 00:05:02.850
<i>Listen to yourself.</i>
<i>You're drunk, drunk, drunk!</i>


57
00:05:02.883 --> 00:05:04.584
Hold on now,
I ain't done talkin' to you.


58
00:05:04.617 --> 00:05:07.822
Oh! Ugh, how dare you?

59
00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:10.557
Why'd you hit me
with that damn door?


60
00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:12.659
Oh, I wish you walked
square into that sucker.


61
00:05:12.693 --> 00:05:14.295
I wish it knocked you clean out!

62
00:05:14.328 --> 00:05:15.997
Oh, I bet.

63
00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:18.665
That way you'd have
all the free time in the world


64
00:05:18.699 --> 00:05:20.533
to run around
with old Johnny Stevens.


65
00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:24.671
You know what?

66
00:05:24.705 --> 00:05:26.874
I don't have to
listen to you anymore.


67
00:05:26.907 --> 00:05:29.210
- I swear I've had it.
- Oh, yeah?


68
00:05:29.243 --> 00:05:31.912
Well, we know
who you do listen to, don't we?


69
00:05:31.946 --> 00:05:34.181
Old Johnny Stevens.

70
00:05:34.215 --> 00:05:36.083
I saw y'all a dancin'.

71
00:05:36.117 --> 00:05:38.185
His hands all over my woman.

72
00:05:38.219 --> 00:05:42.289
A married woman dancin'
with a school vice principal.


73
00:05:42.323 --> 00:05:44.058
- That's ridiculous!
- Shut up, Ronnie!


74
00:05:49.864 --> 00:05:53.300
I bet Johnny Stevens
don't cut his own damn firewood,


75
00:05:53.334 --> 00:05:54.869
I tell you that.

76
00:05:58.039 --> 00:05:59.940
Son of a bitch
tryin' to dance with my woman.


77
00:05:59.974 --> 00:06:03.177
I should've clocked his ass
across the dance floor.


78
00:06:06.881 --> 00:06:09.784
Bum-ass can't keep
a job no way.


79
00:06:09.817 --> 00:06:11.584
Ain't fit for nothing.

80
00:06:16.924 --> 00:06:18.793
<i>Look-it, baby,</i>
<i>I'm sorry about earlier.</i>


81
00:06:18.826 --> 00:06:20.728
I know I got you all riled up.

82
00:06:21.594 --> 00:06:24.231
I just saw Johnny Stevens
and you dancin' like that,


83
00:06:24.265 --> 00:06:27.968
and well,
considering I'd been drinkin',


84
00:06:28.002 --> 00:06:31.138
and you know how I get when I
get the hard stuff in me, honey.


85
00:06:31.172 --> 00:06:33.774
Well, you know better
than to drink it.


86
00:06:34.008 --> 00:06:36.110
Oh, I begged you
not to get like this tonight,


87
00:06:36.143 --> 00:06:38.813
- and look what happened.
- I know, I know.


88
00:06:39.713 --> 00:06:41.882
Thing about it is, baby...

89
00:06:42.716 --> 00:06:44.185
I can't help it.

90
00:06:44.418 --> 00:06:47.154
When I got a woman
as beautiful as you,


91
00:06:47.188 --> 00:06:48.322
I see Johnny Stevens

92
00:06:48.355 --> 00:06:51.058
with his meat hooks
all over you,


93
00:06:51.092 --> 00:06:53.828
well, it's just
natural response for me


94
00:06:53.861 --> 00:06:55.863
to get a little bit teed off.

95
00:06:56.497 --> 00:06:59.366
You know I'm sorry. I really am.

96
00:07:00.935 --> 00:07:02.103
Aw, hon.

97
00:07:02.937 --> 00:07:05.739
That still ain't no excuse
for yellin' at me like you did.


98
00:07:05.773 --> 00:07:08.641
I know it, I know it.
And I tell you what?


99
00:07:08.675 --> 00:07:11.745
When we go to church on Sunday,
that's the first thing


100
00:07:11.779 --> 00:07:13.280
I'mma pray about.

101
00:07:13.714 --> 00:07:15.783
You'll go to church with me?

102
00:07:15.816 --> 00:07:17.885
Well, of course,
it's been too long.


103
00:07:17.918 --> 00:07:19.720
I owe Jesus a visit.

104
00:07:24.291 --> 00:07:27.361
- I love you, Ronnie.
- Oh, I love you too, baby.


105
00:07:29.263 --> 00:07:31.165
Good Lord.

106
00:07:31.198 --> 00:07:34.034
Phew!
These must be new, huh?


107
00:07:34.068 --> 00:07:36.337
Yeah, K
-Mart special.

108
00:07:37.271 --> 00:07:39.707
So, you tellin' me
I got K-Mart to blame


109
00:07:39.740 --> 00:07:42.776
for all these dirty thoughts
bouncin' around in my head?


110
00:07:42.810 --> 00:07:44.845

Ah-ha! Oh! Yes!

324
00:18:41.869 --> 00:18:44.504
Oh, my God, Betsy,
this is my lucky charm!


325
00:18:44.739 --> 00:18:48.009
Oh, man.
It's our lucky day.


326
00:18:48.042 --> 00:18:50.912
What exactly
are you talkin' about, honey?


327
00:18:51.045 --> 00:18:53.981
This is the
fumblerooski helmet of '84.


328
00:18:54.015 --> 00:18:56.117
Oh.

329
00:18:56.150 --> 00:18:58.719
Oh, this is the helmet
McLintock was wearin'


330
00:18:58.753 --> 00:19:00.888
when he scored
the winning touchdown.


331
00:19:01.255 --> 00:19:02.890
Sounds amazing.

332
00:19:11.032 --> 00:19:13.901
Do you have to be
so overdramatic, Arthur?


333
00:19:15.569 --> 00:19:16.804
You're such a baby!

334
00:19:18.973 --> 00:19:20.007
Jeez!

335
00:20:29.777 --> 00:20:32.579
Ain't no trespassin'
around here, boy.


336
00:20:33.014 --> 00:20:35.649
Especially by some
mask-wearin' weirdo.


337
00:20:35.750 --> 00:20:36.851
Hey!

338
00:20:36.984 --> 00:20:38.719
Now, don't you
do nothing stupid, boy.


339
00:20:47.494 --> 00:20:49.096
Well...

340
00:20:50.031 --> 00:20:52.532
you got some big balls on you.

341
00:20:53.968 --> 00:20:57.470
Well, I got some big uns, too,

342
00:20:58.239 --> 00:21:01.842
and that's why they call me
Big Willie Nathan.


343
00:21:04.111 --> 00:21:06.446
Now, I'm goin' up here
to do my chore.


344
00:21:07.915 --> 00:21:10.851
Little kitty cats
ain't gonna feed their selves.


345
00:21:16.656 --> 00:21:18.558
Now, when I turn back around,

346
00:21:18.591 --> 00:21:21.228
I best see your ass
headin' down that road.


347
00:21:22.529 --> 00:21:24.699
You and the hearse
you rode in on.


348
00:21:40.281 --> 00:21:42.850
If you're lookin' to get
your brain scrambled here today,


349
00:21:42.883 --> 00:21:44.719
boy, you are in luck.

350
00:21:44.752 --> 00:21:48.723
Cause the skillet's on the stove
and the grease is already hot.


351
00:21:50.057 --> 00:21:51.125
Okay, buddy boy,

352
00:21:51.491 --> 00:21:54.228
you about to go
from the fryin' pan to the fire.


353
00:22:00.167 --> 00:22:02.003
What in tarnation?

354
00:22:02.602 --> 00:22:05.006
Look here, son,
I tried to warn you.


355
00:22:05.039 --> 00:22:06.040
Now, what you should have done

356
00:22:06.073 --> 00:22:08.209
was acted like a gravy train
on biscuit wheels


357
00:22:08.242 --> 00:22:10.111
and rolled your ass
on out of here!


358
00:22:26.293 --> 00:22:28.796
Oh. Whoa, whoa, look.

359
00:22:28.829 --> 00:22:29.930
Whoa, now! Whoa!

360

00:28:26.353 --> 00:28:28.589
Okay, but are you sure
you wanna do that?


457
00:28:28.690 --> 00:28:31.291
I mean George
and Sharon are back together.


458
00:28:31.325 --> 00:28:33.327
Don't you wanna avoid
that love triangle drama?


459
00:28:33.360 --> 00:28:34.595
They're not
getting back together.


460
00:28:34.628 --> 00:28:36.230
If you say so.

461
00:28:36.263 --> 00:28:38.399
Just don't be surprised
if Sharon tries to punch you out


462
00:28:38.432 --> 00:28:40.033
the next time she sees you.

463
00:28:40.067 --> 00:28:41.969
What? So, my friends
are having a party next door


464
00:28:42.002 --> 00:28:44.571
and I can't go just cause
George has a crush on me?


465
00:28:44.905 --> 00:28:46.440
You like him, too.

466
00:28:46.473 --> 00:28:49.209
No, I don't. George, really?

467
00:28:49.243 --> 00:28:50.978
<i>Yeah, George really.</i>

468
00:28:51.245 --> 00:28:53.514
<i>Those eyebrows?</i> [chuckling]

469
00:28:53.614 --> 00:28:55.983
- <i>Are you kidding me?</i>
- <i>Oh, yeah.</i>


470
00:28:57.017 --> 00:28:57.786
I just don't wanna see you

471
00:28:57.819 --> 00:29:00.287
in another
messed up relationship.


472
00:29:00.320 --> 00:29:02.489
I appreciate you're tryin'
to look out for me right now,


473
00:29:02.523 --> 00:29:04.525
but this is different.

474
00:29:05.325 --> 00:29:06.527
George is different.

475
00:29:07.762 --> 00:29:09.530
- Are these okay?
- Mm-hm.


476
00:29:11.733 --> 00:29:13.967
Hoosiers? Really?

477
00:29:14.001 --> 00:29:16.336
I like basketball.

478
00:29:16.370 --> 00:29:17.237
So when are you clockin' out?

479
00:29:17.271 --> 00:29:19.273
As soon as Cody's
slow ass gets here.


480
00:29:19.306 --> 00:29:20.574
He's already 15 minutes late.

481
00:29:20.607 --> 00:29:21.975
Okay, we'll be outside.

482
00:29:27.147 --> 00:29:29.650
Can we please go
to Catfish Cabin?


483
00:29:29.751 --> 00:29:31.618
No, they're only open
for dinner.


484
00:29:37.257 --> 00:29:39.560
Why do I get the feeling
you're lying to me?


485
00:29:41.128 --> 00:29:43.964
PJ, I would never lie to you.

486
00:29:44.064 --> 00:29:46.099
I'm the one person in your life
that you could always count on


487
00:29:46.133 --> 00:29:48.135
to be real with you,
no matter what.


488
00:29:48.168 --> 00:29:49.036
Okay?

489
00:29:51.605 --> 00:29:53.073
Whoo...

490
00:29:59.213 --> 00:30:01.315
<i>Man, I'm gonna</i>
<i>bag Holcomb tonight.</i>


491
00:30:02.182 --> 00:30:04.384
I thought you
were all over Angela.


492
00:30:04.418 --> 00:30:06.220
Well, I'mma bag her, too!

493
00:30:06.353 --> 00:30:08.288
See, Holcomb's
spendin' the night with Maggie,


494
00:30:08.322 --> 00:30:10.491
so I'mma have to
get that in before halftime.


495
00:30:10.524 --> 00:30:12.059
Then I'll have
the rest of the night


496
00:30:12.092 --> 00:30:12.927
with Angela.

497
00:30:12.961 --> 00:30:14.628
Man, I get playin'
the field and all,


498
00:30:14.661 --> 00:30:18.165
but that's some really
questionable decision-making.


499
00:30:19.399 --> 00:30:20.768
What?
Are you fucking kidding me?


500
00:30:20.802 --> 00:30:23.337
I'm being judged by the guy
who's tryin' to bag Maggie


501
00:30:23.370 --> 00:30:25.539
and Sharon at the same time.

502
00:30:25.707 --> 00:30:29.142
That is highly inaccurate,
my f-- friend.


503
00:30:29.176 --> 00:30:30.778
I am a single man.

504
00:30:32.212 --> 00:30:34.515
Yeah. Yeah, you're s--single,

505
00:30:34.548 --> 00:30:36.450
cause your dick
is ready to wander.


506
00:30:36.784 --> 00:30:38.820
Man, if Maggie wasn't
giving you the signs right now,


507
00:30:38.853 --> 00:30:40.454
you'd still be shopping
for engagement rings


508
00:30:40.487 --> 00:30:41.689
with Sharon, you little prick.

509
00:30:41.723 --> 00:30:44.258
- I'll check on my brother.
- "I'll check on my brother."


510
00:30:44.291 --> 00:30:46.093
Yeah, you need to check him
into a mental institute,


511
00:30:46.126 --> 00:30:47.729
that's where you need
to check him into.


512
00:30:48.262 --> 00:30:50.564

faking that shit anyway, man.

How many damn people
does it take to order a pizza?


607
00:34:42.395 --> 00:34:43.363
I've been
waiting on you to do that


608
00:34:43.396 --> 00:34:44.999
since you walked in the door.

609
00:34:45.032 --> 00:34:46.533
You know,

610
00:34:46.566 --> 00:34:48.803
we should respect
my meemaw's kitchen and um,


611
00:34:48.836 --> 00:34:50.537
go upstairs.

612
00:34:55.743 --> 00:34:57.912
Why don't you go
order the pizza, hmm?


613
00:34:57.945 --> 00:34:59.046
Seriously?

614
00:35:02.616 --> 00:35:04.819
Oh, I'm gonna bag that ass.

615
00:35:07.088 --> 00:35:11.391
I'm O'Toole, baby.
I'm Peter fucking O'Toole.


616
00:35:18.498 --> 00:35:19.834
Gross.

617
00:35:28.843 --> 00:35:30.577
Why would he do that?

618
00:35:36.449 --> 00:35:37.251
Whoa!

619
00:35:37.285 --> 00:35:38.385
Alright, PJ,

620

to watch the game.

621
00:35:39.386 --> 00:35:41.823
- Can I come?
- No, it's a grown-up party.


622
00:35:41.923 --> 00:35:43.557
Well, you're
just watching football.


623

Any idiot can do that.

624
00:35:48.595 --> 00:35:50.832
Okay,
but you're not gonna have fun.


625
00:35:53.600 --> 00:35:55.102
- Okay.
- Alright!


626
00:35:55.136 --> 00:35:57.104
I'm going to a grown-up party!

627
00:35:58.605 --> 00:35:59.974

00:42:58.592 --> 00:43:00.427
Yeah, we're so lucky.

762
00:43:00.461 --> 00:43:01.962
Yeah, you really are.

763
00:43:02.930 --> 00:43:04.932
I mean we've been
thinking about it forever.


764
00:43:04.965 --> 00:43:06.233
- Really?
- Mm-hm.


765
00:43:06.267 --> 00:43:09.403
About... each other...

766
00:43:10.504 --> 00:43:11.972
and you.

767
00:43:12.006 --> 00:43:13.274
- Mm-hm.
- Mm-hm.


768
00:43:15.843 --> 00:43:19.546
But you have to let us
have our way with you.


769
00:43:19.580 --> 00:43:21.949
Oh, that's not a problem.
Go for it, okay.


770
00:43:25.452 --> 00:43:27.054
What are y'all doing?

771
00:43:31.058 --> 00:43:32.226
Um...

772
00:43:40.134 --> 00:43:42.603
Okay. Um...

773
00:43:42.636 --> 00:43:45.506
Uh-- uh, yeah,
alright, just put--


774
00:43:45.539 --> 00:43:46.907
Put that right up there.

775
00:43:48.409 --> 00:43:50.244
God, you are like makin'
all of my fantasies


776
00:43:50.277 --> 00:43:52.012
come true right now.

777
00:43:52.046 --> 00:43:53.247
And you have no idea.

778
00:43:53.280 --> 00:43:57.351
Shouldn't I be tyin' y'all up,
instead of you tyin' me up,


779
00:43:57.384 --> 00:43:58.886
cause, I just-
- Oh.

780
00:43:58.919 --> 00:44:00.454
No, we wanna do it this way.

781
00:44:00.487 --> 00:44:02.256
Oh, okay.

782
00:44:02.289 --> 00:44:04.425
We wanna show you our titties.

783
00:44:04.558 --> 00:44:06.493
- Alright, well...
- Hmm.


784
00:44:06.527 --> 00:44:08.562
Whose do you wanna see first?

785
00:44:08.595 --> 00:44:11.098
Um, doesn't
really matter to me.


786
00:44:11.131 --> 00:44:13.000
How about both
at the same time?


787
00:44:13.600 --> 00:44:14.535
Hmm.

788
00:44:16.003 --> 00:44:19.139
What if we get
someone else to join in?


789
00:44:19.173 --> 00:44:21.909
Would you want Maggie
or Sharon?


790
00:44:21.942 --> 00:44:22.943
If you asked me 10 times,

791
00:44:22.976 --> 00:44:24.611
I would say Maggie's name
every fuckin' time.


792
00:44:24.645 --> 00:44:26.113
Like do you really think
I wanna see Sharon's titties?


793
00:44:26.146 --> 00:44:27.648
Come on. Maggie.

794
00:44:27.681 --> 00:44:30.551
- We'll be right back.
- Okay. Um...


795
00:44:36.223 --> 00:44:37.925
Alright, I'll just wait here.

796
00:44:42.062 --> 00:44:44.631
Yes.

797
00:44:46.367 --> 00:44:48.969
Oh, my God, I'm about to
fuck three of the most


798
00:44:49.002 --> 00:44:52.072
bodacious bitches
in Hackleburg history.


799
00:44:54.508 --> 00:44:56.043
I deserve this.

800
00:44:58.011 --> 00:45:00.981
And you certainly deserve this.
Yeah.


801
00:45:07.054 --> 00:45:09.123
Oh, welcome back.

802
00:45:09.156 --> 00:45:11.125
- They're on their way.
- Okay.


803
00:45:11.826 --> 00:45:14.061
Holcomb's trying
to talk Maggie into it.


804
00:45:14.094 --> 00:45:14.995
Okay.

805
00:45:15.529 --> 00:45:17.064
Until then...

806
00:45:18.599 --> 00:45:22.569
Ooh, we should take it all off.

807
00:45:22.737 --> 00:45:24.405
I like the sound of that.
That's fine with me.


808
00:45:24.438 --> 00:45:27.207
Mm-hm.

809
00:45:27.941 --> 00:45:30.177
It'll be better
if nobody can hear you scream.


810
00:45:34.348 --> 00:45:36.350
Peter, Peter, pumpkin eater.

811
00:45:37.251 --> 00:45:40.220
A little birdie told me
you wanted to see some titties.


812
00:45:40.254 --> 00:45:43.023
We brought you
the biggest ones in Alabama.


813
00:45:45.592 --> 00:45:47.628
Take it in. Take it in.

814
00:45:47.661 --> 00:45:50.364
Isn't this what you wanted, huh?

815
00:45:50.765 --> 00:45:53.267
Isn't this what you wanted?

816
00:45:53.300 --> 00:45:55.369
- Oh, look at that.
- Fuck you, man!


817
00:45:55.402 --> 00:45:56.270
One of these days,

818
00:45:56.303 --> 00:45:58.205
whenever I get up
out of this chair,


819
00:45:58.238 --> 00:46:01.175
I'mma plop 'em right on top
of that red head of yours.


820
00:46:01.208 --> 00:46:03.010
What?
They're bigger than mine.


821
00:46:03.043 --> 00:46:05.379
Fuck you, Peter.

822
00:46:05.747 --> 00:46:07.314
Enjoy your alone time.

823
00:46:08.081 --> 00:46:10.050
Bye.

824
00:46:10.083 --> 00:46:11.753
Fuck you, man!

825
00:46:11.786 --> 00:46:13.688
Fucking piece of shit.

826
00:46:51.726 --> 00:46:53.761
What the fuck are you doing,
man?


827
00:47:41.241 --> 00:47:43.410
War, damn, Seahawk!

828
00:47:43.443 --> 00:47:45.212
How did they
leave him wide open?


829
00:47:45.245 --> 00:47:47.614
Must be painful
being an A&M fan.


830
00:47:48.148 --> 00:47:49.684
Uh, you tell her, Neil.

831
00:47:49.918 --> 00:47:52.085
Oh, man, hell of
a series by Barker there.


832
00:47:52.119 --> 00:47:54.221
Pouncin' on 'em
like kittens on a string.


833
00:47:54.254 --> 00:47:56.490
Yeah, yeah.

834
00:47:56.958 --> 00:47:59.192
I don't know who would
want to be a Commonwealth fan.


835
00:47:59.226 --> 00:48:00.427
Wanna go upstairs?

836
00:48:00.695 --> 00:48:02.764
Yeah. Okay.

837
00:48:02.797 --> 00:48:04.331
- Okay?
- Yeah.


838
00:48:13.473 --> 00:48:14.675
Who's that?

839
00:48:15.075 --> 00:48:17.678
- What do you mean who's that?
- Why is there an old man here?


840
00:48:17.712 --> 00:48:20.314
Oh, man, what a game!

841
00:48:21.049 --> 00:48:22.616
Why is he
dressed like a referee?


842
00:48:22.649 --> 00:48:24.117
I don't know.

843
00:48:25.552 --> 00:48:27.588
Okay, I'm going to the bathroom.

844
00:48:40.902 --> 00:48:42.469
Hey, where you going?

845
00:48:42.870 --> 00:48:44.504
To pick up my pizza.

846
00:48:44.872 --> 00:48:47.374
God, it's just pizza.

847
00:48:48.910 --> 00:48:50.577
Hey, you're getting breadsticks?

848
00:49:01.254 --> 00:49:03.858
Stop it. No.

849
00:49:05.325 --> 00:49:06.761
Alright, well...

850
00:49:07.628 --> 00:49:09.563
let's just t--talk.

851
00:49:10.798 --> 00:49:12.499
- Just talk.
- Mm-hm.


852
00:49:13.166 --> 00:49:15.135
- Alright, just talk.
- Yeah.


853
00:49:17.337 --> 00:49:18.873
Sharon and I are done.

854
00:49:19.206 --> 00:49:22.409
You know, we should
say anything to her or...


855
00:49:23.210 --> 00:49:27.581
I mean, she knows
that we're-- we're over.


856
00:49:27.849 --> 00:49:31.819
Maybe I should.
I've known her my whole life.


857
00:49:31.853 --> 00:49:32.887
Yeah.

858
00:49:33.087 --> 00:49:35.155
Never not told her anything.

859
00:49:36.590 --> 00:49:38.760
Fair, yeah.
So, you wanna...


860
00:49:40.494 --> 00:49:42.362
t-- t--
take our time with it?


861
00:49:43.563 --> 00:49:45.933
- If that's okay.
- Yeah.


862
00:49:45.967 --> 00:49:47.401
Okay.

863
00:49:47.634 --> 00:49:50.470
I r-
- I really like you.

864
00:49:51.505 --> 00:49:52.940
I like you, too.

865
00:49:53.808 --> 00:49:56.610
- Thank you for understanding.
- Of course.


866
00:50:48.595 --> 00:50:50.865

should head downstairs

before anyone gets suspicious.

879
00:51:46.620 --> 00:51:47.855
I'll hang out here.

880
00:51:49.090 --> 00:51:50.958
- Probably a good idea.
- Yeah.


881
00:51:55.362 --> 00:51:56.964

<i>And as we</i>
<i>reach halftime...</i>


883
00:52:02.136 --> 00:52:04.538
Hey, you were in the bathroom
for a really long time.


884
00:52:04.571 --> 00:52:06.540
Are you okay?

885
00:52:06.573 --> 00:52:08.608
Yeah, gross. Be a lady.

886
00:52:09.442 --> 00:52:10.610
Well, it's halftime,

887
00:52:10.644 --> 00:52:13.047
so can we please go
to Catfish Cabin?


888
00:52:13.613 --> 00:52:16.050
Oh, wow,
let me think about that.


889
00:52:16.083 --> 00:52:18.986
- Please.
- Mm, mm, yes.


890
00:52:19.020 --> 00:52:20.520
Really?

891
00:52:20.554 --> 00:52:21.588
- Yes. I said yes.
- Do you wanna come?


892
00:52:21.621 --> 00:52:23.523
- I'm game.
- Yeah!


893
00:52:23.557 --> 00:52:25.760
Okay. Ooh-wooh, 
Catfish Cabin!

894
00:52:25.793 --> 00:52:27.594
- Catfish Cabin.
- Wooh!


895
00:52:28.361 --> 00:52:31.799
Hey, ladies,
y'all be safe, okay?


896
00:52:31.833 --> 00:52:34.035
And be sure to hurry back
for the third quarter.


897
00:52:34.068 --> 00:52:36.603
That's when the game
gets real fun.

I'm sure he's already got
George up there untyin' him.

Hmm.

Okay, fine! Fine!

- Angela, right behind you!

You know, we're lucky.

00:57:15.416 --> 00:57:18.986
It's the seventh year in a row
since the last murder spree.


976
00:57:19.186 --> 00:57:21.255
I wouldn't call us lucky.

977
00:57:21.355 --> 00:57:24.325
It had nothin' to do with us.
We were like 15 the last time.


978
00:57:24.558 --> 00:57:26.293
The last time what?

979
00:57:26.427 --> 00:57:29.096
The last time Jack Harding
went on a murder spree.


980
00:57:29.897 --> 00:57:31.065
It's true.

981
00:57:31.098 --> 00:57:32.700
He's the boogeyman
of Hackleburg.


982
00:57:33.234 --> 00:57:35.202
He's killed at least 50 people.

983
00:57:35.236 --> 00:57:37.404
And he only comes out
on the third Saturday


984
00:57:37.438 --> 00:57:38.638

985

You know, that's today, right?

986
00:57:40.875 --> 00:57:42.877

- <i>He's got 'em!</i>

00:57:51.385 --> 00:57:54.889

- Son-of-a-bitch!


993

994
00:57:59.426 --> 00:58:02.396

This pizza's ice cold.

1001
00:58:16.010 --> 00:58:17.278
It was cold
by the time I picked it up,


1002
00:58:17.311 --> 00:58:19.213
and now it might
as well be frozen.


1003
00:58:19.880 --> 00:58:22.850
Well hell,
just go heat it up in the oven.


1004
00:58:22.950 --> 00:58:24.718
I'm sure Peter won't mind.

1005
00:58:24.752 --> 00:58:26.954
And if he does, he can suck it.

1006
00:58:28.189 --> 00:58:30.457
Good idea, Lester.
You think of everything.


1007
00:59:04.992 --> 00:59:06.927

1011
00:59:12.533 --> 00:59:14.034
Where is everyone?

1012
00:59:14.335 --> 00:59:16.036
Uh, Let's see.

1013
00:59:16.170 --> 00:59:19.006
George vanished upstairs
a long time ago.


1014
00:59:20.808 --> 00:59:23.077
Angela went to
hook up with Peter.


1015
00:59:24.445 --> 00:59:27.047
And Holcomb and Maggie
went to Catfish Cabin


1016
00:59:27.081 --> 00:59:28.082
with the kid.

1017
00:59:29.516 --> 00:59:31.485
What a night. I'm starving.

1018
00:59:32.186 --> 00:59:35.055
What,
you don't like cold pizza?


1019
00:59:35.556 --> 00:59:38.492
There's literally
nothing worse than cold pizza.


1020
00:59:48.602 --> 00:59:49.503
I'm gonna heat it up

1021
00:59:49.536 --> 00:59:51.305
so the cheese
is meltin' off each slice.


1022
00:59:51.338 --> 00:59:53.007
It's gonna be so good.

1023
00:59:53.674 --> 00:59:57.077
Heck, don't get it too hot.
You'll burn it.


1024
00:59:57.511 --> 00:59:59.546
I won't burn it.
I love it hot.


1025
01:00:00.881 --> 01:00:02.916
Say, I'd love a slice.

1026
01:00:03.083 --> 01:00:05.219
Sure. You guys can have some.

1027
01:00:05.252 --> 01:00:06.553
None for me.

1028
01:00:07.588 --> 01:00:09.256
I don't eat pizza.

1029
01:00:10.024 --> 01:00:12.426
Got it. More for me.

1030
01:00:13.127 --> 01:00:14.028
Hey!

1031
01:00:14.061 --> 01:00:16.397

1032
01:00:17.364 --> 01:00:21.068
Hope not. I hate rain.

1033
01:00:21.168 --> 01:00:22.503
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

1034
01:00:37.084 --> 01:00:40.554
Fuck.
I can't do anything right.


1035
01:00:49.029 --> 01:00:50.931
Dang,
I guess she done burned herself


1036
01:00:50.964 --> 01:00:52.166
with that pizza.

1037
01:00:52.299 --> 01:00:54.234
I told her
she was gonna get it too hot.


1038
01:00:54.803 --> 01:00:57.538
That's definitely why
I don't eat pizza.


1039
01:01:22.363 --> 01:01:25.065
- Oh, man. Shit.
- Oh, horseshit!

I think these refs
are bein' paid.

I'm on it.

1048

Hello, Sharon!

1050

Come in, Sharon.

1052
01:02:43.177 --> 01:02:48.348
That's 15-yard penalty on Sharon
for burning the pizza.


1053
01:02:55.289 --> 01:02:57.491
Seriously, where are you?

1054
01:03:02.196 --> 01:03:05.532
She burnt the pizza to a crisp,
but I can't find her.


1055
01:03:06.333 --> 01:03:09.536
Heck, she must be so embarrassed
that she's hidin' away.

the bathroom, it's upstairs.

stab really far back,

1218

karate-chop him in his throat


1219
01:13:50.344 --> 01:13:52.179
like that,
so he can't breathe,


1220
01:13:52.213 --> 01:13:53.781
and then you
kick him in the balls,


1221
01:13:53.814 --> 01:13:55.082
and then you take
the sharpest thing


1222
01:13:55.116 --> 01:13:58.252
you could find, and stab him.

1223
01:13:58.285 --> 01:14:00.020
- Okay?
- Okay.


1224
01:14:00.121 --> 01:14:01.889
Or you probably
don't have to do that,


1225
01:14:01.922 --> 01:14:04.125
cause I would never let
anything happen to you, okay?


1226
01:14:04.158 --> 01:14:06.360
Just leave it all to me.
I got you.


1227
01:14:06.794 --> 01:14:08.796
- Same.
- Okay.


1228

1229

- Mm-hm?


1230
01:14:16.837 --> 01:14:18.372

You got it.

01:25:08.455 --> 01:25:10.758
Yeah, right.
He'll never be dead.
