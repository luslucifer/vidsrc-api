INTERVIEWER: One of the phrases
that CAMP members use a lot


321
00:19:58.349 --> 00:20:00.230
is the phrase "Coming out."

322
00:20:00.310 --> 00:20:02.349
What does it actually mean?

323
00:20:02.430 --> 00:20:05.030
BON: I mean, I think it...
It means having the courage,


324
00:20:05.109 --> 00:20:07.830
and it is courage at this stage,

325
00:20:07.909 --> 00:20:11.590
to be able to tell other people
that you're homosexual,


326
00:20:11.669 --> 00:20:15.269
without having necessarily
anything to shout about.


327
00:20:15.869 --> 00:20:17.469
I mean, there's nothing whatsoever

328
00:20:17.549 --> 00:20:20.310
different about me
because I am homosexual.

have a satisfactory


331
00:20:24.109 --> 00:20:26.069
sexual relationship without a man?

332
00:20:26.149 --> 00:20:28.669
-LANCE: You're slouching there.
-Well, there are lots of different ways


333
00:20:28.750 --> 00:20:32.349
that people can express
their affection for one another.


334

Their love... For one another.

335
00:20:35.869 --> 00:20:38.869
And I think that sexual relationship
is only one aspect of that.

Sorry, but when have we agreed
on a position?

Decriminalization?

Yeah, but lesbian sex isn't a crime.

Well, the fact that these buggers
are still criminals

01:43:58.710 --> 01:44:00.950
Just for one day

1870
01:44:03.630 --> 01:44:05.789
We can be us

1871
01:44:07.310 --> 01:44:09.390
Just for one day
