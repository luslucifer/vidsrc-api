1
00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:01.190
The best place to meet a guy
is the supermarket,


2
00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.030
You see a guy holding a list,
you know he's married,


3
00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:08.430
He's in the frozen-food section
carrying a small basket, he's single,


4
00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:12.590
l hang out by fruits and vegetables,
Better chance of getting a guy who's healthy,


5
00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:17.270
Probably the best place
is Home Depot or any hardware store,


6
00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:21.110
You just walk up
to the cutest guy and say:


7
00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:24.990
''Do you know where l can get nailed?
l mean, nails?


8
00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:27.790
Pardon me,
l've been drinking all afternoon,''


9
00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.390
And that way he knows,
one, that you're easy,,,


10
00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:33.910
,,,and two, that you like to drink,

11
00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:39.230
l thought a great place to meet girls would
be night school where they teach English,


12
00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:41.990
Because these girls
would be from foreign lands,,,


13
00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:45.230
,,,and maybe still a little disoriented
from the journey,,,


14
00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:49.470
,,,and l would look attractive
because l speak English very goodly,


15
00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:52.270
But in the end,
it did not work out as l had hoped,


16
00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:56.750
l mean, basically, l was told to
take a hike in 1 4 languages,


17
00:01:56.910 --> 00:02:00.310
Where do you meet people?
l don't know, they're everywhere,


18
00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:03.910
Why, is there a problem?

19
00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:12.430
No, No way,
l'm not going out with this guy,


20
00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:15.630
Just call him, Say hello,
He's in my book club,


21
00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:18.070
-Why is there a woman here?
-lt's his wife,


22
00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:21.430
They're separated, but he didn't want
to Photoshop her out,,,


23
00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:23.990
,,,if you're not interested,
They are in Hawaii,


24
00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:27.310
lt's the Four Seasons,
This could be you in the photograph,


25
00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:28.950
Aloha,

26
00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:31.830
-Well, if you change your mind,
-l've got a picture too,


27
00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:34.550
ls that why you're all here?
The whole family?


28
00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:37.670
-Everyone has a picture for me?
-This is an intervention, Sarah,


29
00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:40.550
-He's great,
-A beautiful girl like you can't just give up,


30
00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:41.950
There's life after divorce,

31
00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:44.590
You were married to the same woman
for 45 years, Dad,


32
00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:47.990
-What do you know about divorce?
-Precious little, l admit,


33
00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:51.390
The black specter of two lives
torn asunder,


34
00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:52.870
Not helping, Dad,

35
00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:55.270
l wish your mother were here,
God rest her soul,


36
00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:58.310
-She'd know what to say,
-''Put on another pot of tea,''


37
00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:02.150
That's what she'd say,
The lrish answer to all problems,


38
00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:04.510
-Well, it worked most of the time,
-Who is this?


39
00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:07.750
l have no idea, but if you're interested,
l'll Google him,


40
00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:10.590
ls this it for food in this house,
like, eight crackers?


41
00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:12.670
And what are these?
Are these bananas?


42
00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:15.590
-l think they were at one time,
-l'll take one,


43
00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:18.830
-l guess l forgot to shop this month,
-What are you gonna do, sis?


44
00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:22.910
-l mean, really, it's been eight months,
-Dad's giving-up idea sounds intriguing,


45
00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:26.230
l could become the crazy aunt
who moves in down in the basement,


46
00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:29.950
Put a cot in for me, some herbal teas,
l'd like to get a dog, if that's okay?


47
00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:32.670
Marc, don't you have
a friend for Sarah?


48
00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:36.510
''A Friend for Sarah,'' l'm now an episode
of Little House on the Prairie,


49
00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:39.590
-Come on, you must know somebody,
-Not really,


50
00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:44.030
But if you want to have an affair,
l do know a couple of married guys,


51
00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:48.350
-We'll let that be our fallback, okay?
-Okay,


52
00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:51.710
-An affair, that's a terrific idea,
-My husband to the rescue,


53
00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:53.110
Don't cover mine,

54
00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:55.750
l think affairs should go
on the other side,


55
00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:00.270
Yeah,

56
00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:11.590
Hey, Jake,

57
00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:13.430
Hey, Charlie,

58
00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:16.790
Divorce is final,

59
00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:18.110
You're a free man,

60
00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:22.030
l don't know if,,,is the
appropriate sentiment, Four years,,,


61
00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:24.550
-,,,woman l loved, l got my ass kicked,
-High-five,


62
00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:26.190
Not that kind of moment either,

63
00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:28.710
-Down low?
-Just because l want this to stop,


64
00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:31.950
You are officially the worst client
l've ever had,


65
00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:33.990
-Thank you,
-Let Lisa have everything,


66
00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:36.630
Even the judge wanted you to keep
those boxing gloves,


67
00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:40.030
-She really liked you,
-l liked her too, as far as judges go,


68
00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:41.750
No, l mean, really,

69
00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:46.190
Wow, that's a good-looking Cougar,

70
00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:50.630
Excellent stuff, You think she'd like
to buy a handmade, stainable teak boat?


71
00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:52.990
Maybe if it came with private lessons,

72
00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:55.950
Everybody wants all that Tupperware,,,

73
00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:58.990
,,,those computer-designed,
fiberglass-composite things,


74
00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:01.070
l mean, don't even look like boats,

75
00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:03.790
They look like boats when they
whiz by your wooden guy,


76
00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:06.870
That was one race, and l've made
some adjustments, Charlie,


77
00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:09.710
-Wood boats can win, trust me on that,
-They can't win,


78
00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:11.470
That's why people don't want them,

79
00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:13.670
They can't win,
but they lose beautifully,


80
00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:16.990
And the whole experience
is just better, Look at this,


81
00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:19.630
l'm making these boats
the exact same way,,,


82
00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:22.870
,,,the Spanish and the Portuguese
made their ships of exploration,


83
00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:25.590
There's a continuity
at stake here, Charlie,


84
00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:27.630
This is more than a boat,

85
00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:31.190
-This is a time machine,
-lf you paid this much attention to Lisa,,,


86
00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:33.590
-,,,you'd still be together,
-This is true,


87
00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:37.190
But you know what? lf l had to do it
it all over again, l wouldn't,


88
00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:42.350
l wouldn't,
Lisa taught me about sadness,,,


89
00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:44.590
,,,about human frailty,,,

90
00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:47.350
,,,and how unbearably fleeting
happiness can be,


91
00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:50.990
-l'm gonna owe her for the rest of my life,
-Oh, you'll be paying, Monthly,


92
00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:54.070
Hope you don't mind
that l brought Mother Teresa,


93
00:05:54.230 --> 00:05:59.310
Are you kidding? l love this girl,
Mother Teresa, do you have a friend for me?


94
00:05:59.470 --> 00:06:01.230
Hey, is everything all right at home?

95
00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:04.550
Yeah, Jennifer just gets tired
of all the family gatherings,


96
00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:06.950
Too many old stories,
lt makes her feel left out,


97
00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:08.590
Yeah, Kevin used to say that,

98
00:06:08.790 --> 00:06:10.350
-l still say it,
-l say it too,


99
00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:13.150
lt seems hard now, 
Sarah, l know,,,

100
00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:15.910
,,,but you get a chance to make
a new life for yourself,


101
00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:18.550
Thank you, but in
the marketplace of available women--


102
00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:21.790
Any guy would be lucky to get you,
You're smart, you're funny,,,


103
00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:24.430
,,,even pretty when
you're not wallowing in self-pity,


104
00:06:24.590 --> 00:06:25.910
Am l wallowing? Really?

105
00:06:26.070 --> 00:06:28.870
You're not the wallower
in the family, Carol is the wallower,


106
00:06:29.030 --> 00:06:31.750
Me? l never wallow,
l suffer in silence,


107
00:06:32.070 --> 00:06:34.470
-No, that's Christine,
-Thank you, Michael,


108
00:06:34.630 --> 00:06:36.190
No, no,

109
00:06:37.590 --> 00:06:39.270
-Sylvia Plath,
-This is why people,,,


110
00:06:39.470 --> 00:06:41.230
,,,don't have large families anymore,

111
00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:43.790
-Bye, l love you,
-Bye,


112
00:06:44.190 --> 00:06:46.030
-Bye, Bill,
-Love you, Carol,


113
00:06:46.870 --> 00:06:48.710
-See you, Dad,
-Thank you, l think,


114
00:06:48.870 --> 00:06:50.030
Bye, Chris, Bye,

115
00:06:50.190 --> 00:06:51.670
-See you later, Dad,
-Bye, Daddy,


116
00:06:51.830 --> 00:06:52.870
Bye,

117
00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:56.950
There's someone special
waiting for you, Sarah,


118
00:06:57.150 --> 00:07:00.670
l know it, Someone worthy,

119
00:07:01.190 --> 00:07:04.390
Kevin was not, on his best day,,,

120
00:07:04.590 --> 00:07:07.070
,,,good enough for you, sweetheart,

121
00:07:07.590 --> 00:07:09.310
Now you tell me,

122
00:07:29.550 --> 00:07:31.110
Why not?

123
00:07:31.310 --> 00:07:35.510
You know l love you and l love Lisa,
but l think you're both better off,


124
00:07:35.670 --> 00:07:38.590
We sure weren't making each other
happy there at the end,


125
00:07:39.710 --> 00:07:41.590
Or the beginning,

126
00:07:42.190 --> 00:07:43.430
Or the middle,

127
00:07:43.630 --> 00:07:48.270
l mean, don't get me wrong, we all
wanted to sleep with Lisa, but marriage,,,,


128
00:07:48.470 --> 00:07:50.790
-That's not right,
-l said that out loud, didn't l?


129
00:07:50.950 --> 00:07:53.910
-You did,
-l better strike that from the record,


130
00:07:54.110 --> 00:07:57.150
No, lawyers get to do that,
l'm instructing you to disregard that,


131
00:07:57.350 --> 00:08:00.070
l think women have
the whole thing planned,


132
00:08:00.310 --> 00:08:02.590
Really, the whole thing,

133
00:08:02.790 --> 00:08:06.110
An epic narrative in their heads,
You know my theory about this?


134
00:08:06.270 --> 00:08:08.550
When you meet,
they have the whole story written,


135
00:08:08.710 --> 00:08:10.430
But you don't get to read it,

136
00:08:10.630 --> 00:08:13.030
But if you go off script,,,

137
00:08:13.310 --> 00:08:15.750
,,,right? They write you out
of the story,


138
00:08:15.910 --> 00:08:17.630
l got written out of Act 3,

139
00:08:17.910 --> 00:08:21.310
Now you're in Act 4, where l get you
banged every night of the week,


140
00:08:21.470 --> 00:08:24.030
Charlie, l'm toast, l just got shredded,
l am--


141
00:08:24.270 --> 00:08:27.030
-lt's time, healing time, l'm on the bench,
-Hey, Hey,


142
00:08:27.190 --> 00:08:30.750
l'm out of the game,
Bench me, bench me,


143
00:08:31.350 --> 00:08:32.550
-Hey,
-Benched,


144
00:09:17.550 --> 00:09:19.470
l'll be right with you,

145
00:09:20.990 --> 00:09:23.830
-Hi, Can l help you?
-Single chicken breast, please,


146
00:09:23.990 --> 00:09:26.550
For an extra 75 cents,
you can get the whole fryer here,


147
00:09:26.710 --> 00:09:28.510

150
00:09:33.870 --> 00:09:35.430
l hate to see food go bad,

151
00:09:35.910 --> 00:09:38.870
We got a hundred recipes,
You can cook them, freeze them and--


152
00:09:39.230 --> 00:09:42.350
Look, listen to me, mister,
l'm divorced, okay?


153
00:09:42.550 --> 00:09:44.710
l eat alone,

154
00:09:44.870 --> 00:09:46.950
l don't want chicken
hanging around, okay?


155
00:09:47.430 --> 00:09:50.110
-Okay,

-l'm sorry, Eric's parents are in town,


160
00:10:45.030 --> 00:10:47.430
Mr, and Mrs, Stalin,

161
00:10:47.590 --> 00:10:49.190
-Weren't they just here?
-Thank you,


162
00:10:49.350 --> 00:10:52.910

a hotel, Nothing l do makes them happy,


163
00:10:53.110 --> 00:10:55.950
And they make Eric so nervous,
he's like the Tin Man,


164
00:10:56.150 --> 00:10:59.030
You have to hang in there, Leo,
You and Eric are my model,,,

-l fear for you, child,


166
00:11:02.310 --> 00:11:05.510
Anyone have anything exciting
happen this weekend to share?


167
00:11:05.670 --> 00:11:07.270
My Uncle Mike slept over,

168
00:11:07.470 --> 00:11:10.310
Uncles and aunts
are very important to us, aren't they?


169
00:11:10.470 --> 00:11:14.470
He's not really my uncle,
but my mommy makes me call him that,


170
00:11:15.790 --> 00:11:20.230
When he's there, l can't sleep with
my mommy because he's in her bed,


171
00:11:21.230 --> 00:11:23.630
Anyone else have anything
they'd like to share?


172
00:11:23.790 --> 00:11:25.190
Yes, Austin,

173
00:11:25.390 --> 00:11:27.390
My parents are trying it
apart for a while,


174
00:11:27.590 --> 00:11:29.750
-We have a theme, June,
-Yes, we do,


175
00:11:29.910 --> 00:11:34.310
And Mom says my dad is incorrigible,
That means he likes other women,


176
00:11:37.750 --> 00:11:39.550
Good,

177
00:11:39.750 --> 00:11:40.990
One, two,

178
00:11:41.710 --> 00:11:43.190
Let me try,

179
00:11:43.390 --> 00:11:45.030
That's a hop,

180
00:11:46.590 --> 00:11:50.030
One, two, that's a new step,
Very good,


181
00:11:50.430 --> 00:11:53.110
-Molly, you wanna try the sticks?
-Yeah, come on, Molly,


182
00:11:56.110 --> 00:11:58.710
Very good, Keep it going like that,

183
00:11:59.470 --> 00:12:01.550
-Watch,
-No, l'm doing it,


184
00:12:02.710 --> 00:12:04.590
Austin!

185
00:12:05.230 --> 00:12:07.390
Good Lord, it's a gusher,

186
00:12:13.910 --> 00:12:15.830
Let me see your teeth,

187
00:12:16.630 --> 00:12:18.830
-Hey, bubba,
-Look who's here,


188
00:12:19.030 --> 00:12:20.350
Daddy!

189
00:12:21.470 --> 00:12:23.670
-Are you all right?
-Yep, l'm fine,


190
00:12:24.190 --> 00:12:27.150
He had a decent bloody nose
for a while, but he's fine now,


191
00:12:27.310 --> 00:12:31.430
-You didn't have to rush right over,
-A kid bleeds, l show up, lt's house rules,


192
00:12:31.590 --> 00:12:33.710
-You wanna get your stuff together now?
-Yeah,


193
00:12:33.870 --> 00:12:37.110
-Then l need a minute alone with Ms, Nolan,
-Okay, Bye, Ms, Nolan,


194
00:12:37.270 --> 00:12:39.030
Bye,

195
00:12:54.110 --> 00:12:55.510
No, No, No,

196
00:12:56.790 --> 00:12:58.270
So, Ms, Nolan,,,,

197
00:12:58.550 --> 00:13:00.950
-Sarah, please,
-And l'm Bob,


198
00:13:01.110 --> 00:13:02.790
Actually, everybody calls me Bobby,

199
00:13:02.990 --> 00:13:05.150
l've been trying to change it
since third grade,


200
00:13:05.350 --> 00:13:06.710
l'm a pushover for Bobbys,,,

201
00:13:06.870 --> 00:13:10.750
,,,ever since my first boyfriend,
Bobby Healy, just,,,,


202
00:13:10.910 --> 00:13:12.190
You know?

203
00:13:12.430 --> 00:13:16.830
l forget, is it ''always discuss your personal
history with parents'' or ''never discuss''?


204
00:13:17.030 --> 00:13:20.470
lt's ''always discuss,''
Besides, l find it comforting,


205
00:13:20.670 --> 00:13:23.070
So has Austin told you
anything about,,,?


206
00:13:23.270 --> 00:13:24.790
-About you and--
-Yeah,


207
00:13:24.990 --> 00:13:28.950
That you're taking a break from
your marriage and you're incorrigible,


208
00:13:29.110 --> 00:13:30.830
That phrasing came from his mother,

209
00:13:30.990 --> 00:13:33.710
-l wouldn't have put it that way, but--
-l'm sorry,


210
00:13:33.910 --> 00:13:36.350
lf there's anything you think
l need to know, tell me,


211
00:13:36.550 --> 00:13:38.750
-l will,
-Sometimes with Austin, you can forget,


212
00:13:38.950 --> 00:13:40.750
-Because he seems so mature,
-l know,


213
00:13:40.950 --> 00:13:43.270
The other day he asked
about my retirement plan,


214
00:13:43.430 --> 00:13:46.830
Well, he cares about you, and he
wants you to be financially secure,


215
00:13:47.550 --> 00:13:50.510
You know Austin adores you,
l can see why,


216
00:13:50.910 --> 00:13:54.110
-Thank you, Bob,
-l might prefer Bobby after all,


217
00:13:54.270 --> 00:13:56.830
l mean, l like the,,,,
l like the history,


218
00:14:05.070 --> 00:14:08.270
Two guys alone in the afternoon

-There's something gravely wrong here,
-lt's all there, man,


220
00:14:11.870 --> 00:14:14.270
The yearning, the suffering,
a woman you'll pursue,,,


221
00:14:14.430 --> 00:14:16.350
,,,through blizzards, across continents,

222
00:14:16.510 --> 00:14:19.630
A love so real,
even after you're dead it still hurts,


223
00:14:19.830 --> 00:14:22.230
-That's all l want,
-You need to get out,


224
00:14:22.390 --> 00:14:25.350
-You do, You need to see real people,
-You wanna watch it again?


225
00:14:25.510 --> 00:14:28.750
No, l want to go out, Come on,
l previewed some lnternet ads for us,


226
00:14:28.910 --> 00:14:31.990
lnternet ads? Come on,
l want Zhivago's lnternet ad:


227

229
00:14:40.110 --> 00:14:42.270
What do you bet he gets
a hundred responses?


230
00:14:42.430 --> 00:14:45.110
We'll start with bisexual
Asian women who fly-fish,


231
00:14:45.310 --> 00:14:47.910
-No lnternet ads,
-This is for you, l hate to fly-fish,


232
00:14:48.070 --> 00:14:49.750
-No, you don't,
-What about Sherry?


233

-l gave you her number, You never called,
-Sherry?

Sherry's 24, Her range of interest
extends from kickboxing to Tae Bo,


235
00:14:56.950 --> 00:14:59.070
She slept with half the guys
in my office,


236
00:14:59.270 --> 00:15:01.350
Then why do you want
to set me up with her?


237
00:15:01.550 --> 00:15:04.870
She slept with half the guys
in my office,


238

She's in her early 20s, You know
the epic narrative l talked about?


239
00:15:08.270 --> 00:15:10.990
Hers would not only be secret,
it would be incoherent,


240
00:15:11.150 --> 00:15:13.270
l wouldn't get past the cover page,

241
00:15:14.310 --> 00:15:17.110
l mean, l'm looking
for something more than Sherry,

-Meandering or any other way?
-Well, think of it as poetry, darling,

As who l am
in the bottom of my soul,


291
00:18:12.030 --> 00:18:14.830
And, Sarah, my darling,

292
00:18:15.030 --> 00:18:18.110
-What?
-l'm glad you've started dating again,


293
00:18:18.550 --> 00:18:22.550
Dad, please, This is disturbing
on so many levels,


294
00:18:23.110 --> 00:18:25.790
-At least let me have the rose,
-l can't,


295
00:18:26.110 --> 00:18:28.270
l'm seeing someone else at 4:00,

296
00:18:38.750 --> 00:18:42.350
Hello. You've reached Sarah Nolan.
Leave a message if you want to.


297
00:18:42.670 --> 00:18:45.390
Sarah, it's me, Christine. Pick up.

298
00:18:46.310 --> 00:18:49.230
Come on, Sarah,
I already talked to Dad.


299
00:18:53.990 --> 00:18:56.990
-Who else knows?
-No one.


300
00:18:57.470 --> 00:18:59.430
Come on, Carol has to know,

301
00:18:59.590 --> 00:19:03.470
Why does Carol have to know? Couldn't
I once know something before she does?


302
00:19:03.870 --> 00:19:06.110
She's there with you, isn't she?

303
00:19:06.270 --> 00:19:09.310
-No.
-Hello, Carol,


304
00:19:09.590 --> 00:19:13.510
Hi, Sarah. I was telling Chris it's a shame
I didn't know about this before...


305
00:19:13.670 --> 00:19:16.910
...because I could have called
Uncle Chet. We could have doubled.


306
00:19:17.070 --> 00:19:19.150
Oh, no.

307
00:19:19.910 --> 00:19:24.190
This story is going to be immortalized
into family history, isn't it?


308
00:19:24.350 --> 00:19:28.030
Told and retold
at Thanksgiving dinner, year after year,


309
00:19:28.190 --> 00:19:32.230
Oh, not just Thanksgiving.
I think it's a good Christmas story too.


310
00:19:32.670 --> 00:19:34.270
-Bye, guys,
-Wait.


311
00:19:34.430 --> 00:19:38.030
Tell the truth. On a scale of one to 1 0,
how would you rate Dad as a date?


312
00:19:38.190 --> 00:19:40.070
Hot, super hot?

313
00:19:47.390 --> 00:19:50.230
Don't be mad at me for this, okay?

314
00:19:50.390 --> 00:19:53.670
The last time you said that to me
you stole my boyfriend, Danny Shea,


315
00:19:53.830 --> 00:19:56.670
l did not steal Danny Shea,

316
00:19:56.830 --> 00:20:01.070
-l haven't forgiven you, by the way,
-Stop, He was a terrible kisser,


317
00:20:01.270 --> 00:20:05.070
-He kissed just fine with me,
-Okay, Here goes,


318
00:20:05.270 --> 00:20:07.470
l went online, pretended l was you,,,

319
00:20:07.670 --> 00:20:11.270
,,,and put your profile
on PerfectMatch,com,


320
00:20:13.150 --> 00:20:15.190
You're making this up,

321
00:20:15.590 --> 00:20:18.110
You can't just sit back
and passively answer,,,


322
00:20:18.270 --> 00:20:21.510
,,,other people's ads anymore,
We are on offense,


323
00:20:21.670 --> 00:20:25.070
Well, forgive me if l'm a tad gun-shy
after my last date with my father,


324
00:20:25.230 --> 00:20:28.510
Come on, at least look at your profile,

325
00:20:29.110 --> 00:20:31.030
That's my high school
graduation picture,


326
00:20:31.230 --> 00:20:33.670
That's all l had,
That or your wedding photo,


327
00:20:33.870 --> 00:20:35.430
''Voluptuous''? Carol!

328
00:20:35.590 --> 00:20:38.950
Every woman listed claims
to be at least voluptuous,


329
00:20:39.150 --> 00:20:43.270
Some are ''gorgeous inside and out,''
most are ''sexually confident,''


330
00:20:43.470 --> 00:20:48.230
''Voluptuous, sensuous DWF seeks
special man to share starlit nights,


331
00:20:48.430 --> 00:20:50.750
-Must love dogs,''
-l put that in for you,


332
00:20:50.950 --> 00:20:52.870
And yet l'm still pissed,

333
00:20:53.030 --> 00:20:57.390
l must have done something right,
You have 1 8 responses,


334
00:20:57.750 --> 00:20:59.630
You listened to them, didn't you?

335
00:20:59.830 --> 00:21:03.070
l like three, 1 1 and 1 4,
Christine likes two and eight,


336
00:21:03.270 --> 00:21:07.070
Michael liked them all,
But you decide for yourself,


337
00:21:38.750 --> 00:21:41.710
What do you mean by voluptuous?
Do you mean big breasts...


338
00:21:41.870 --> 00:21:43.750
...or do you mean fat?

339
00:21:45.510 --> 00:21:46.750
I love dogs too.

340
00:21:46.910 --> 00:21:50.590
I have a great sense of humor,
but you could probably already tell that.


341
00:21:51.150 --> 00:21:52.590
Yo.

342
00:21:53.310 --> 00:21:56.030
My name is Walter Taylor.
I'm an attorney.


343
00:21:56.190 --> 00:22:00.710
Don't hang up.
I like opera. Don't delete me.


344
00:22:01.950 --> 00:22:04.550
So anyway, l get all dressed up,,,

345
00:22:04.750 --> 00:22:07.390
,,,and l walk down
the stairs and l see,,,

346
00:22:07.590 --> 00:22:12.750
,,,my father sitting there
holding a single yellow rose,


347
00:22:12.950 --> 00:22:14.510
And it dawns on me,,,,

348
00:22:15.470 --> 00:22:19.430
-ls something wrong?
-Well, no offense, it's just,,,,


349
00:22:21.110 --> 00:22:23.270
l thought you'd be younger, that's all,

350
00:22:25.350 --> 00:22:28.670
Well, you said your age range
was 25 to 45,


351
00:22:28.830 --> 00:22:31.510
l guess l was hoping more for 25,

352
00:22:33.030 --> 00:22:34.630
Twenty-three,

353
00:22:35.190 --> 00:22:37.910
Eighteen, That's legal,

354
00:22:41.470 --> 00:22:43.550
lt's nice to be out,

355
00:22:43.710 --> 00:22:45.630
l've been feeling kind of blue lately,

356
00:22:45.870 --> 00:22:49.510
l know, you mentioned on the phone,
Lennie, that you've-- Kind of depressed,

-Did l cry?
-Well, a little bit,


358

l've been on 1
7 first dates this year,

359
00:22:56.390 --> 00:22:58.310
No second dates,

360
00:22:58.910 --> 00:23:01.110
One went,,,

361
00:23:01.590 --> 00:23:04.390
,,,to check her coat
and never came back,


362
00:23:04.750 --> 00:23:09.110
One jumped out at the light
when it changed,


363
00:23:09.270 --> 00:23:14.150
Well, we're almost through the salad,
That's a good sign,


364
00:23:16.150 --> 00:23:17.670
No,

365
00:23:18.230 --> 00:23:19.790
Lennie,

366

Lots of male cousins, brothers,
Used to this sort of thing,


376
00:23:48.950 --> 00:23:50.190
Three out of five,

Well, l offered to pay my half,

You'd look really good in handcuffs,

385
00:24:19.870 --> 00:24:22.470
Charlie, my boy,

-You having fun?


392
00:24:39.110 --> 00:24:41.710
Well, l feel sorry for the artist
at these things,


393
00:24:41.870 --> 00:24:45.430
All this talent on display,

l know l am,

397
00:24:52.390 --> 00:24:57.350

right now to be in a serious relationship,


398
00:24:57.590 --> 00:25:00.390
And with somebody as wonderful
and as beautiful as you,,,

00:25:04.670 --> 00:25:07.310
-Why can't you be sweet like that, huh?
-Sherry!

-Hey, guys,

You're a sick guy, you know that?

403
00:25:12.550 --> 00:25:16.150
Just another in a long line
of colossal mistakes,

l'm not answering an lnternet ad,

She'll be good-looking
when she grows up,

he really plays dead,


432
00:26:49.670 --> 00:26:53.110
You don't know the half of it,
He can stop his heart like a Sufi mystic,


433
00:26:53.270 --> 00:26:56.550
-Does he sleep on a doggy bed of nails?
-As a matter of fact, he does,


434
00:26:56.750 --> 00:26:59.510
He feels nothing,
Or perhaps he feels too much,


435
00:27:02.270 --> 00:27:04.430
-l think he wants his treat now,
-You think so?


436

While he's playing dead?
lt might ruin the effect,

-l don't know, He's your dog,
-He's not, He's my friend Charlie's,

-So you're here under false pretenses,
-No, not at all,


439
00:27:13.430 --> 00:27:17.150
You said ''must love dogs,''
not ''must own dogs,'' l do love dogs,


440
00:27:17.550 --> 00:27:19.830
ln fact, l had one with my ex,

441
00:27:19.990 --> 00:27:22.310
She was allergic,
went into anaphylactic shock,


442
00:27:22.510 --> 00:27:24.470
So we had to put her down, Dog,

443
00:27:24.630 --> 00:27:27.110
Not the wife, l'm kidding about both,

444
00:27:28.150 --> 00:27:31.310
This is a beautiful canine
you have here,


445
00:27:31.470 --> 00:27:34.030
-Hi,
-Yes, this is Mother Teresa,


446
00:27:35.390 --> 00:27:38.310
Yeah, she plays with lepers?

447
00:27:38.790 --> 00:27:41.670
Comforts the poor? Yeah,
How long you had her?


448
00:27:41.830 --> 00:27:45.390
Technically, she's not really mine,
She's my brother's,


449
00:27:45.590 --> 00:27:48.390
l'm shocked and saddened,

450
00:27:49.150 --> 00:27:52.710
-False pretenses,
-Well, we are related, She's family,


451
00:27:52.910 --> 00:27:56.870
And l do really love dogs,
and my ex was allergic also,


452
00:27:57.030 --> 00:27:59.710
Yes, he often had
''anaphyphlectic'' shock,


453
00:27:59.990 --> 00:28:01.310
You're making that up,

454
00:28:02.710 --> 00:28:05.150
-Yes, l am,
-Me too,


455
00:28:07.190 --> 00:28:09.630
Tell me, l'm just curious
about one thing,


456
00:28:09.790 --> 00:28:11.470
Why did you write ''voluptuous''?

457
00:28:12.990 --> 00:28:15.270
-Oh, my--
-No! l did not mean to be rude at all,


458
00:28:15.430 --> 00:28:18.310
lt's just that voluptuous,
that tends to go the other way,,,


459
00:28:18.470 --> 00:28:19.990
,,,when someone uses that phrase,

460
00:28:20.190 --> 00:28:22.230
Towards the full-figured end
of the spectrum,


461
00:28:22.390 --> 00:28:24.710
l didn't know there was
a full-figured spectrum,


462
00:28:24.870 --> 00:28:27.350
lt's one of those words
they use in personal ads,,,


463
00:28:27.510 --> 00:28:30.270
,,,like ''Rubenesque''
or ''weight proportionate to height,''


464
00:28:30.470 --> 00:28:33.070
Hey, it's your ad, You can say
whatever you want, l'm,,,,


465
00:28:33.230 --> 00:28:38.430
Just for the record, girl says ''athletic,''
she means ''flat-chested,'' Which you're not,


466
00:28:38.590 --> 00:28:40.830
But-
- This isn't coming out right,

467
00:28:41.790 --> 00:28:43.350
Look, you know, l'm sorry,

468
00:28:43.550 --> 00:28:46.990
l'm,,,, l'm a little nervous, l'm not used
to meeting people this way,


469
00:28:47.190 --> 00:28:49.150
Really? You seem very practiced
and smooth,


470
00:28:51.230 --> 00:28:54.750
-Your ad doesn't do you justice,
-Well, maybe you should rewrite my ad,


471
00:28:54.950 --> 00:28:57.270
-Well, maybe l don't want to,
-And why not?


472
00:28:57.470 --> 00:29:00.270
Because maybe l don't want
anyone else to answer it,


473
00:29:01.110 --> 00:29:03.070
Did you plan on saying
that sometime today?


474
00:29:03.270 --> 00:29:07.230
-No, l didn't, But it's good, isn't it?
-lt is good,


475
00:29:07.430 --> 00:29:11.270
-lt's a good line,
-Maybe we should try this over again,


476
00:29:11.870 --> 00:29:13.550
Hi, l'm Jake,

477
00:29:13.790 --> 00:29:15.230
Sarah,

478
00:29:15.590 --> 00:29:18.790
So why would you even write an ad?
You don't seem that desperate,


479
00:29:18.990 --> 00:29:21.150
Why would you answer one?
Talk about desperate,


480
00:29:21.310 --> 00:29:24.230
l'm not, l mean, l didn't,
lt was my friend's, He gave it to me,


481
00:29:24.430 --> 00:29:26.830
-l didn't write it, My sister did,
-Your sister's ad,


482
00:29:27.270 --> 00:29:29.710
Your brother's dog,
Those your shoes?


483
00:29:30.270 --> 00:29:33.470
Oh, my, Look at the time!
Come on, honey,


484
00:29:33.710 --> 00:29:36.190
What l'm trying to say is
l'd like to get to know you,


485
00:29:36.350 --> 00:29:39.750
l have to get this dog home, and you
don't want to go over on your rental,


486
00:29:40.630 --> 00:29:43.670
Maybe we could try this another time,
You know, without the dogs,


487
00:29:44.350 --> 00:29:45.830
You bet,

488
00:29:47.230 --> 00:29:48.590
l'll call you,

489
00:29:50.550 --> 00:29:51.990
Sarah, for the record,,,

490
00:29:52.190 --> 00:29:55.310
,,,you are kind of voluptuous
in a minimalist sort of way,


491
00:30:01.430 --> 00:30:04.550
l'm not sure l'm up for this dinner
at Dad's new girlfriend's house,


492
00:30:04.710 --> 00:30:07.550
-He seems really excited about her,
-Where are Marc and Jason?


493
00:30:07.710 --> 00:30:09.390
They took the kids
to Magic Mountain,


494
00:30:09.550 --> 00:30:12.470
The kids didn't even really
want to go, The dads whined,


495
00:30:12.630 --> 00:30:14.710
Well, they're so spoiled, those dads,

496
00:30:14.950 --> 00:30:17.150
So how was your day today?
At the dog park?


497
00:30:17.350 --> 00:30:20.470
-How did you know about that?
-Who do you think you're dealing with?


498
00:30:20.630 --> 00:30:22.950
-You're good, l have to give you that,
-So come on,


499
00:30:23.150 --> 00:30:24.470
-Tell me,
-Okay,


500
00:30:24.630 --> 00:30:27.830
We got off to kind of a rough start,
But then it was okay, you know?


501
00:30:28.030 --> 00:30:31.310
He was a little intense, He was nervous,
He couldn't stop insulting me,


502
00:30:31.470 --> 00:30:33.150
You know what this sounds like,

503
00:30:33.310 --> 00:30:36.430
-No, it's not, Don't say it,
-But it is, lt's a growth opportunity,


504
00:30:36.590 --> 00:30:39.630
l'm not over my last growth opportunity
when you stole Danny Shea,


505
00:30:39.830 --> 00:30:43.230
Will you forget Danny Shea?
He's probably a convicted felon,,,


506
00:30:43.390 --> 00:30:45.070
,,,by now, divorced,

507
00:30:45.310 --> 00:30:47.070
-Maybe you should call him,
-Carol,


508
00:30:47.230 --> 00:30:50.670
What about that guy you met
at preschool? You maimed his kid?


509
00:30:50.870 --> 00:30:53.150
-Bob Connor,
-Yeah, Mr, lncorrigible,


510
00:30:53.390 --> 00:30:56.150
l told you, l can't,
He's the father of one of my students,


511
00:30:56.310 --> 00:31:00.030
Yes, honey, but he's not your father,
That's a big step forward for you,


512
00:31:01.310 --> 00:31:03.590
-Bill,
-Dolly,


513
00:31:13.430 --> 00:31:15.350
Hey!

514
00:31:29.190 --> 00:31:33.030
-What a lovely home you have, Dolly,
-Thank you,


515
00:31:33.230 --> 00:31:36.710
When my third husband died,
l decided to give up the big house,


516
00:31:36.910 --> 00:31:39.670
Third out of how many?

517
00:31:40.670 --> 00:31:42.590
And these potholders?

518
00:31:43.470 --> 00:31:45.150
Where did you manage to find them?

519
00:31:45.310 --> 00:31:49.030
Why, everything in this house
is handmade by Dolly,


520
00:31:49.190 --> 00:31:51.510
Oh, yes, She's very creative,

521
00:31:51.710 --> 00:31:54.510
Our mother used to sew all our clothes
when we were younger,


522
00:31:54.670 --> 00:31:56.470
-Sarah,
-Well, she did,


523
00:31:56.670 --> 00:31:59.910
Your father told me
all about your mother, honey,


524
00:32:00.110 --> 00:32:02.190
She must have been
a very special lady,


525
00:32:02.910 --> 00:32:05.590
-She was,
-And you must miss her very much,


526
00:32:06.070 --> 00:32:07.750
-l do,
-And you see me,,,


527
00:32:07.910 --> 00:32:09.990
,,,as something of an interloper,
l suppose,


528
00:32:10.590 --> 00:32:12.830
Do you want me
to lie down for this?

529
00:32:15.310 --> 00:32:17.670
We're at interloping?
When did that happen?


530
00:32:17.870 --> 00:32:20.110
lt's Dad's life, l don't meddle,

531
00:32:20.350 --> 00:32:22.590
Carol, you meddle
in my life all the time,


532
00:32:22.750 --> 00:32:26.390
Well, technically that's not true,
because you don't have a life,


533
00:32:26.550 --> 00:32:28.270
l happen to have a very full life,

534
00:32:28.510 --> 00:32:30.310
Did you even check
all of your messages?


535
00:32:30.470 --> 00:32:32.630
l thought a few were very promising,

536
00:32:32.830 --> 00:32:35.990
-Like who?
-Like the engineer from Oxnard,


537
00:32:36.190 --> 00:32:39.390
-With the sexual dysfunction,
-ln what way would he be promising?


538
00:32:39.590 --> 00:32:42.070
You could cure him,
The whole nurse-patient thing,


539
00:32:42.230 --> 00:32:45.710
-You've got it all worked out,
-lt was brave of him to be so forthcoming,


540
00:32:45.870 --> 00:32:47.990
-Why don't you call him, then,
-Why don't you,


541
00:32:48.150 --> 00:32:50.310
-Call! l'll give you his number,
-Maybe l will,


542
00:32:50.470 --> 00:32:51.470
-Go for it,
-Okay,


543
00:32:51.670 --> 00:32:53.510
Hey there, Ms, Nolan,

544
00:32:54.550 --> 00:32:57.030
What are you doing yelling
in Whispering Breeze Park?


545
00:32:57.190 --> 00:32:58.750
Look who it is,

546
00:32:58.950 --> 00:33:01.190
-What a surprise,
-Oh, hi, Ms, Nolan, How are you?


547
00:33:01.350 --> 00:33:03.550
-Hi, sweetie,
-Who's that?


548
00:33:03.750 --> 00:33:06.150
-Oh, this is my sister Carol,
-Nice to meet you,


549
00:33:06.310 --> 00:33:10.830
This is Austin, my student,
and his dad, Mr, Connor, Bob,


550
00:33:10.990 --> 00:33:12.670
Actually, l go by Bobby now,

551
00:33:13.030 --> 00:33:14.630
Right, You live here?

552
00:33:14.830 --> 00:33:17.390
Yeah, they cater to the recently
separated and divorced,


553
00:33:17.590 --> 00:33:20.950
But l'm the youngest guy here
by 40 years, so it's good for my morale,


554
00:33:21.670 --> 00:33:24.950
-My wife and l are gonna try it apart,
-l know,


555
00:33:26.750 --> 00:33:28.470
Will you just look at her, son?

556
00:33:28.630 --> 00:33:31.030
ls my little girl lovely
or is my little girl lovely?


557
00:33:31.390 --> 00:33:33.830
Oh, Dad, don't worry
about embarrassing me,


558
00:33:33.990 --> 00:33:36.750
Stop it, Bill,
She is cute as a button, though,


559
00:33:36.950 --> 00:33:40.590
So, what is it you do, Bobby?
Sarah never tells us about her beaus,


560
00:33:40.790 --> 00:33:42.950
l'm finishing my Ph,D,
in American history,


561
00:33:43.150 --> 00:33:45.910
-A biography of Robert E, Lee,
-l always felt sorry for Lee,


562
00:33:46.110 --> 00:33:49.150
Forced to fight against his old friends
and West Point classmates,


563
00:33:49.310 --> 00:33:50.710
Could only dress in gray, Sad,

564
00:33:51.350 --> 00:33:53.830
She's funny too,
A complete package, you know,


565
00:33:53.990 --> 00:33:56.470
When l need extra money,
l work construction,


566
00:33:56.670 --> 00:33:59.070
Well, it sounds very manly,
Do you wear a hardhat?


567
00:33:59.670 --> 00:34:02.550
Sarah was the one who always had
the boys knocking at the door,


568
00:34:02.710 --> 00:34:05.350
-Oh, Dad,
-She had eyes only for that singer,


569
00:34:05.510 --> 00:34:08.390
What was his name? Thin fellow,

570
00:34:08.750 --> 00:34:10.710
-Looked like a girl,
-Mick Jagger,


571
00:34:10.910 --> 00:34:14.550
No, no, Sarah was saving herself
for David Cassidy,


572
00:34:14.750 --> 00:34:15.950
Like you weren't,

573
00:34:16.150 --> 00:34:19.590
-Carol wasn't saving herself for anybody,
-What?


574
00:34:20.110 --> 00:34:23.430
l remember now, lt was David Cassidy
of The Pheasant Family,


575
00:34:23.590 --> 00:34:25.110
Bill, Bill, honey,

576
00:34:25.270 --> 00:34:28.430
Partridge Family, You know,
l saw him last year in Vegas,


577
00:34:28.630 --> 00:34:31.230
He was good, Hadn't changed a bit,
Same turtleneck,


578
00:34:31.390 --> 00:34:33.830
Sarah had the whole
Partridge act down,


579
00:34:34.070 --> 00:34:36.510
She'd put on the little miniskirt,
the go-go boots,,,


580
00:34:36.710 --> 00:34:38.270
,,,and pretend she was Susan Dey,

581
00:34:38.470 --> 00:34:41.430
-This is all a lie,
-Sing the theme song, Sarah,


582
00:34:41.750 --> 00:34:45.510
-Don't make me kill you, Carol,
-You remember the intro,


583
00:34:54.430 --> 00:34:55.630
-No,
-Come on,


584
00:34:55.830 --> 00:34:56.950
Come on,

585
00:35:45.030 --> 00:35:46.990
Oh, that was what he told you,

586
00:35:47.190 --> 00:35:49.070
-lt was a great night,
-Great night,


587
00:35:49.310 --> 00:35:52.630
l forgot how much fun those
humiliating family sing-alongs can be,


588
00:35:52.790 --> 00:35:55.110
Can l say one thing
about Mr, lncorrigible?


589
00:35:55.270 --> 00:35:59.190
-Only if you sing it,
-He is hot, And he likes you,


590
00:35:59.390 --> 00:36:02.550
l can't, lt's just my luck,
He's the father of one of my students,


591
00:36:02.750 --> 00:36:07.190
He has a Ph,D, and a great ass,
Let's not get dragged down by ethics,


592
00:36:07.390 --> 00:36:09.350
Technically, he doesn't have
his Ph,D, yet,


593
00:36:09.510 --> 00:36:12.830
-But yes, the ass thing, l know,
-God, let's not even mention the eyes,


594
00:36:13.070 --> 00:36:15.990
-The crinkly smile,
-No, That would be wrong,


595
00:36:16.510 --> 00:36:18.310
-So can l ask you a question?
-No,


596
00:36:18.910 --> 00:36:22.110
You never would have left Kevin,
Would you?


597
00:36:22.390 --> 00:36:26.030
lf he hadn't left me?
No, l don't think so,


598
00:36:26.190 --> 00:36:28.870
But you weren't really happy,

599
00:36:29.030 --> 00:36:33.190
Well, l figured that was the life l picked,
so l had to make the most of it,


600
00:36:33.390 --> 00:36:35.670
l'm not even sure
l deserve a new life now,


601
00:36:35.830 --> 00:36:39.230
Sometimes l think that was supposed
to be my one chance and l blew it,


602
00:36:39.390 --> 00:36:42.470
Where did we get these bad attitudes,
you think?


603
00:36:42.870 --> 00:36:44.830
-The nuns?
-Yeah, that works,


604
00:36:45.070 --> 00:36:47.830
Let's blame the nuns,
Can l say one more thing?


605
00:36:49.950 --> 00:36:52.310
You love me, l know,

606
00:36:53.190 --> 00:36:54.790
l do,

607
00:36:56.710 --> 00:36:59.430
l mean, l was really bad,
She did not see my A game,


608
00:36:59.590 --> 00:37:01.710
Sounds like she didn't see
your B or C game,


609
00:37:01.910 --> 00:37:05.030
l'm gonna call her again,
l want to ask her out, l need a mulligan,


610
00:37:05.190 --> 00:37:07.230
Dog threw me,
l mean, the sun was in my eyes,


611
00:37:07.430 --> 00:37:08.830
Pick someone else, start over,

612
00:37:09.030 --> 00:37:11.670
No, this girl, there's something
special about this girl,


613
00:37:11.830 --> 00:37:14.110
You know the expression
''she took my breath away''?


614
00:37:14.270 --> 00:37:18.430
l mean, she did, l actually gasped,
l'm off the bench, man,


615
00:37:18.830 --> 00:37:21.190
Think she'll see you again?
l wouldn't,


616
00:37:21.350 --> 00:37:24.350
You're not nice,
Like, you're not a nice person,


617
00:37:28.030 --> 00:37:29.310
-Hi, June,
-Hey, June,


618
00:37:29.470 --> 00:37:31.510
-Hi, June,
-Hey, June,


619
00:37:31.710 --> 00:37:34.630
Need more cupcakes,
All the dads are staying for the party,


620
00:37:34.790 --> 00:37:36.590
-What's up with that?
-l have no idea,


621
00:37:36.790 --> 00:37:38.870
Every Halloween it's the same thing,

622
00:37:39.030 --> 00:37:42.630
But l guess it's great how involved
they are in their kids' world, lsn't it?


623
00:37:42.830 --> 00:37:44.070
-Yeah,
-Yeah,


624
00:37:45.430 --> 00:37:46.990
Why don't you and Eric come over,

625
00:37:47.150 --> 00:37:50.750
l'll rent a hopelessly romantic movie,
We can all hold hands together and cry,


626
00:37:50.950 --> 00:37:52.790
Sounds fun, but we can't,

627
00:37:52.950 --> 00:37:55.910
lt's our anniversary, and we always
spend it just the two of us,


628
00:37:56.070 --> 00:37:57.270
Sweet,

629
00:37:57.470 --> 00:37:59.870
Seven years ago tonight,
we met at my parents' house,


630
00:38:00.030 --> 00:38:02.830
They were trying to fix Eric up
with my sister,


631
00:38:06.190 --> 00:38:08.110
Sorry we're late,

632
00:38:08.270 --> 00:38:09.950
Austin drives so slow,

633
00:38:10.150 --> 00:38:12.390
l hope my family
wasn't embarrassing last night,


634
00:38:12.790 --> 00:38:16.710
Oh, no, Not at all, They do seem
a little bit involved in your life,


635
00:38:16.870 --> 00:38:19.070
Oh, yeah, Yeah,

636
00:38:19.270 --> 00:38:21.070
Austin's mom's from a large family,

637
00:38:21.270 --> 00:38:23.590
That's a lot of people
that don't speak to me,


638
00:38:23.950 --> 00:38:27.430
-Thimbleful of juice?
-Sure, But just one,


639
00:38:27.870 --> 00:38:30.510
-To good teachers,
-To good dads,


640
00:38:30.710 --> 00:38:33.110
To good teachers
who are also very beautiful,


641
00:38:34.470 --> 00:38:38.990
To good dads who
are dangerously cute and charming,


642
00:38:39.390 --> 00:38:41.510
There you go,

643
00:38:46.630 --> 00:38:49.710
There's an attraction here, Sarah,
You can't deny it,


644
00:38:49.870 --> 00:38:52.390
-l'm not, l'm trying to ignore it,
-Why?


645
00:38:52.630 --> 00:38:55.390
Well, for one, 
Austin is my student,

646
00:38:55.590 --> 00:38:57.630
Two, we're in the puppet closet,

647
00:38:57.790 --> 00:39:01.830
-Couldn't we go out in the real world?
-l'm not so good in the real world,


648
00:39:02.110 --> 00:39:06.310
l was looking at the handbook,
under ''dating, parents and teachers,''


649
00:39:06.550 --> 00:39:08.790
-Nothing, There's nothing there,
-Sarah,


650
00:39:09.350 --> 00:39:13.750
We need the emergency pants,
lt's an emergency,


651
00:39:15.750 --> 00:39:18.950
Emergency pants,
Come on, sweetie,


652
00:39:28.590 --> 00:39:29.830
Hey, babe, my name is Ron.

653
00:39:29.990 --> 00:39:33.990
Mid-40s, handsome, totally toned,

654
00:39:34.150 --> 00:39:35.990
...give or take a piece of pizza.

655
00:39:36.150 --> 00:39:39.670
No, I'm not kidding. I'm totally toned.
Call me, you won't be sorry.


656
00:39:40.910 --> 00:39:42.870
Hi, Sarah, it's Lennie.

657
00:39:43.510 --> 00:39:46.870
I had a wonderful time, and I'm....

658
00:39:50.670 --> 00:39:52.350
I'll call back.

659
00:39:53.750 --> 00:39:57.390
Hi, Sarah? It's Jake Anderson,
the idiot from the dog park.


660
00:39:57.590 --> 00:40:00.350
Actually, that was all a test
to see how you respond...


661
00:40:00.510 --> 00:40:02.870
...to crazy people, and you passed.

662
00:40:03.070 --> 00:40:05.790
So maybe we could see
each other again.


663
00:40:05.990 --> 00:40:08.550
What do you say?
You want to give me another chance?


664
00:40:17.590 --> 00:40:19.030
l had a couple of icebreakers,

665
00:40:19.190 --> 00:40:23.390
l even had a few stories for you,
anecdotes, but l forgot them all,


666
00:40:23.590 --> 00:40:26.630
-l think it might be that dress,
-My sister Carol made me buy it,


667
00:40:27.030 --> 00:40:28.790
l love Carol,

668
00:40:32.030 --> 00:40:34.510
-Well, this is a very charming place,
-Yeah,


669
00:40:34.750 --> 00:40:37.070
-Good food?
-No, not particularly,


670
00:40:37.390 --> 00:40:38.830
But l like the ambiance,

671
00:40:39.030 --> 00:40:42.670
l come here because l know the owners,
the Parseghians, that couple over there,


672
00:40:42.870 --> 00:40:45.110
-See? They're waving,
-They want us to join them,


673
00:40:45.270 --> 00:40:47.510
A few years ago, in a moment
of blazing clarity,,,


674
00:40:47.710 --> 00:40:49.990
,,,l forswore ethnic folk dancing, so,,,,

675
00:40:50.150 --> 00:40:54.550
They'll come over and say hello
and maybe-- How are you? Hi!


676
00:40:55.070 --> 00:40:57.990
-How are you?
-Hello,


677
00:41:00.710 --> 00:41:02.630
Nice, right?

678
00:41:02.830 --> 00:41:04.910
-Sarah, Mr, and Mrs, Parseghian,
-Hello,


679
00:41:05.070 --> 00:41:07.350
-Welcome, Sarah,
-Thank you,


680
00:41:16.110 --> 00:41:17.550
See you later, We'll drink,

681
00:41:17.710 --> 00:41:19.630
-Absolutely,
-Okay,


682
00:41:20.790 --> 00:41:22.750
-You speak Armenian,
-A little bit,


683
00:41:22.990 --> 00:41:24.350
Well, what did you say?

684
00:41:24.550 --> 00:41:27.790
l asked him, ''Where is the youth hostel?''
lt's all l remember,


685
00:41:28.110 --> 00:41:30.590
Kind of a joke we have,

686
00:41:30.830 --> 00:41:32.670
What is it that you do, exactly?

687
00:41:33.550 --> 00:41:35.270
God, no wonder l live alone,

688
00:41:36.390 --> 00:41:37.990
l build boats,

689
00:41:38.150 --> 00:41:40.550
You know, these handcrafted
wooden sculls,,,


690
00:41:40.790 --> 00:41:43.270
-,,,rowing, The racing ones,
-Yeah, Really?


691
00:41:43.470 --> 00:41:45.310
Yeah, Yep,

692
00:41:45.470 --> 00:41:48.030
-Does anyone buy those?
-Nope, Not yet,


693
00:41:48.230 --> 00:41:50.550
Everybody wants all these high-tech,,,

694
00:41:51.030 --> 00:41:54.110
,,,fiberglass, you know, no turbulence,

695
00:41:54.350 --> 00:41:56.350
Where's the fun in that ride?
l don't know,


696
00:41:56.510 --> 00:41:59.430
-But they'll come around,
-Don't count on me, l get seasick,


697
00:41:59.630 --> 00:42:00.910
-ln the bathtub,
-Really?


698
00:42:01.070 --> 00:42:02.350
Yeah,

699
00:42:03.310 --> 00:42:05.950
You know what?
Can we just skip all the small talk?


700
00:42:06.470 --> 00:42:10.510
-What?
-Can we skip the small talk? Just skip it?


701
00:42:10.830 --> 00:42:13.390
You know, like, who are you?
Who am l?


702
00:42:13.590 --> 00:42:15.070
What are we doing here together?

703
00:42:15.390 --> 00:42:17.910
l have this theory that
when you first meet somebody,,,


704
00:42:18.070 --> 00:42:20.710
,,,that's the time when
you have to be totally honest,,,


705
00:42:20.910 --> 00:42:22.550
,,,because you have nothing to lose,

706
00:42:22.710 --> 00:42:24.870
Five, 1 0 years down the road,
gets a lot harder,


707
00:42:25.070 --> 00:42:27.630
You can't say one day,
''Happy anniversary, this is me,''


708
00:42:27.790 --> 00:42:30.030
lt doesn't work that way, This is it,

709
00:42:30.190 --> 00:42:33.750
We'll never see each other as clearly
and as nakedly as we do in this moment,


710
00:42:33.950 --> 00:42:37.750
Right now, This instant, l'm really
scaring you right now, aren't l?


711
00:42:38.190 --> 00:42:40.390
Just a little bit, Yeah,

712
00:42:40.590 --> 00:42:42.830
But, you know, on the one hand,,,

713
00:42:43.030 --> 00:42:46.750
,,,you're very charming and interesting
and you have a lot of energy,


714
00:42:46.950 --> 00:42:49.230
You know, on the other hand,
a little bit scary,


715
00:42:49.470 --> 00:42:50.710
Okay,

716
00:42:50.910 --> 00:42:53.030
Here's my story,
Here's what you need to know,


717
00:42:53.230 --> 00:42:54.750
Okay,

718
00:42:54.910 --> 00:42:57.430
l'm just divorced,
and l had my heart broken badly,,,


719
00:42:57.590 --> 00:43:00.070
,,,by a woman that l really loved,

720
00:43:01.630 --> 00:43:04.430
You know, but l think your heart
grows back bigger,


721
00:43:04.630 --> 00:43:07.390
You know? Once you've got
the shit beat out of you,


722
00:43:07.590 --> 00:43:10.550
And the universe lets
your heart expand that way,


723
00:43:10.710 --> 00:43:14.670
l think that's the function of all this pain
and heartache that we all go through,


724
00:43:14.870 --> 00:43:18.710
You gotta go through that to come out
to a better place, And that's how l see it,


725
00:43:19.990 --> 00:43:22.550
What about you? Why is
a dazzling woman like you single?


726
00:43:26.630 --> 00:43:28.590
You can do it,
You can just tell the truth,


727
00:43:28.750 --> 00:43:31.150
lf you know the truth,
What have we got to lose?


728
00:43:31.310 --> 00:43:35.070
After the dinner we shake hands,
''good night,'' never see each other again,


729
00:43:35.550 --> 00:43:37.110
All right,

730
00:43:39.470 --> 00:43:41.510
He stopped loving me,

731
00:43:42.190 --> 00:43:46.390
l don't know what l did
or what l didn't do,


732
00:43:46.830 --> 00:43:48.510
He just stopped,

733
00:43:53.870 --> 00:43:56.630
l don't think l've ever said
that out loud before,


734
00:44:02.430 --> 00:44:04.270
See, we just had
an honest moment,


735
00:44:04.430 --> 00:44:06.550
Now we can sit back
and enjoy our food,,,


736
00:44:06.710 --> 00:44:08.510
,,,and get to know each other,
l'm Jake,


737
00:44:23.430 --> 00:44:25.190
-Condom?
-You don't have one?


738
00:44:25.430 --> 00:44:27.590
-Why would l have one?
-For occasions like this,


739
00:44:27.750 --> 00:44:29.950
There haven't been
any occasions like this,


740
00:44:30.150 --> 00:44:32.630
-You didn't bring one?
-l didn't want to jinx it,


741
00:44:36.070 --> 00:44:38.670
This preschool of yours,
it's traditional? Developmental?


742
00:44:38.870 --> 00:44:41.230
-Montessori?
-Yeah, yeah, All that, Drugstore!


743
00:44:57.510 --> 00:44:59.590
There's a Rite Aid on 93rd,
Hang a left,


744
00:44:59.790 --> 00:45:01.990
-Should l take the freeway?
-Please turn left!


745
00:45:07.910 --> 00:45:11.830
-ls this the fastest you can go?
-l could go faster, but we'd lift off,


746
00:45:16.830 --> 00:45:18.750
-You drive,
-All right,


747
00:45:21.910 --> 00:45:24.350
For big ones, you need five,
six coats of varnish,


748
00:45:24.550 --> 00:45:26.990
For the singles,
it's a little bit different,


749
00:45:27.190 --> 00:45:29.110
There's one right there, Jackpot!

750
00:45:35.910 --> 00:45:37.590
They're out!

751
00:45:38.230 --> 00:45:41.630
-How can they be out?
-l don't know,


752
00:45:42.110 --> 00:45:43.870
But l have a theory,

753
00:45:44.110 --> 00:45:46.750
Everybody in the whole city
is having sex,,,


754
00:45:46.950 --> 00:45:49.870
,,,at the exact same moment
except us.


755
00:45:51.470 --> 00:45:52.790
But we will press on,

756
00:46:13.390 --> 00:46:15.030
What's wrong?

757
00:46:17.950 --> 00:46:21.470
Well, the magic is gone a little,

758
00:46:22.550 --> 00:46:23.870
Okay,

759
00:46:24.030 --> 00:46:25.990
-l mean, l--
-No, no, l understand totally,


760
00:46:26.150 --> 00:46:28.310
Look, you know,
There's other things we can do,


761
00:46:28.470 --> 00:46:31.750
l'd be happy just to stay with you
and look at you all night,


762
00:46:32.390 --> 00:46:35.110
Yeah, l haven't done this
in a while, And,,,,


763
00:46:35.310 --> 00:46:37.390
-And now you don't want to,
-Yeah,


764
00:46:37.550 --> 00:46:38.750
-Yeah,
-Yeah,


765
00:46:39.070 --> 00:46:42.430
That's all right, lf the magic's gone,
that implies there was once magic,


766
00:46:42.630 --> 00:46:44.150
Not bad for a first date,

767
00:46:44.310 --> 00:46:47.430
-Second date,
-Second date, This is great,


768
00:46:47.710 --> 00:46:49.670
-l had a great time,
-Me too,


769
00:46:50.870 --> 00:46:52.110
So,,,

770
00:46:52.710 --> 00:46:54.310
,,,good night,

771
00:46:59.190 --> 00:47:03.150
-You still have to drive me home, though,
-Right, Because you don't live here,


772
00:47:05.550 --> 00:47:07.230
Hello,

773
00:47:07.430 --> 00:47:11.270
Don't worry, it's just me, l'm in
the kitchen, Filled your freezer again,


774
00:47:11.510 --> 00:47:13.910
There's now enough meat
to feed every guy,,,


775
00:47:14.070 --> 00:47:16.470
,,,who answered your ad and still--

776
00:47:17.270 --> 00:47:20.350
-Jake Anderson, my sister Carol,
-Hi,


777
00:47:20.790 --> 00:47:24.910
-Hi,
-Jake did, in fact, answer the ad,


778
00:47:25.110 --> 00:47:26.710
Do l get my meat?

779
00:47:29.270 --> 00:47:30.750
Thank you,

780
00:47:39.470 --> 00:47:41.830
Sorry to scare him away,

781
00:47:42.030 --> 00:47:45.190
lt's okay, l think we both realized
it wasn't going to happen tonight,


782
00:47:45.390 --> 00:47:47.510
What's the matter? He's so cute,

783
00:47:47.670 --> 00:47:51.750
l don't know, We had a great night,
Laughing, really talking,


784
00:47:51.910 --> 00:47:54.510
You had a guy talking
and you let him escape?


785
00:47:54.710 --> 00:47:57.510
l'm not sure l actually understood
a lot of what he said,


786
00:47:57.750 --> 00:47:59.230
Doesn't matter, He spoke,

787
00:47:59.390 --> 00:48:02.030
And are we talking full sentences here
or just grunting?


788
00:48:02.190 --> 00:48:04.910
He's quite emotional,
l know more about him than Kevin,


789
00:48:05.110 --> 00:48:08.310
An emotional man who likes to talk,

790
00:48:08.510 --> 00:48:11.950
-This is a mythical figure, Sarah,
-l don't think l'm ready for him,


791
00:48:12.110 --> 00:48:15.430
He's looking for the whole dance
and l'm just relearning the steps,


792
00:48:15.630 --> 00:48:19.350
What happened exactly?
Come on, tell me,


793
00:48:19.630 --> 00:48:21.190
-Leave nothing out,
-Okay,


794
00:48:21.390 --> 00:48:23.830
We really connected
at the restaurant, like l said,


795
00:48:24.070 --> 00:48:27.750
But then, where do you go from there?
How much baba ganoush can you have?


796
00:48:28.110 --> 00:48:31.030
Then we started making out,
which was like being in 1 1 th grade,


797
00:48:31.270 --> 00:48:34.870
Then neither one of us had a condom,
which l think reflects some ambivalence,


798
00:48:35.070 --> 00:48:37.710
l'm just not cut out for this,
Life in the fast lane,


799
00:48:37.910 --> 00:48:40.910
Fast lane? You're not even
on the on-ramp,


800
00:48:41.110 --> 00:48:44.790
-But these people seem happy,
-Of course they do, They have a condom,


801
00:48:44.990 --> 00:48:47.910
Marc and l couldn't find a condom once,
Wanna know what we used?


802
00:48:48.110 --> 00:48:50.390
-No,
-Saran Wrap,


803
00:48:50.710 --> 00:48:54.110
Thanks for that image which will
stay in my brain for the rest of my life,


804
00:48:54.270 --> 00:48:57.310
lt was sexy in a Good Housekeeping
kind of way,


805
00:48:57.470 --> 00:49:00.230
l'll never be able to wrap
leftovers again,


806
00:49:00.550 --> 00:49:02.630
-Did it work?
-Maeve was born nine months,,,


807
00:49:02.830 --> 00:49:04.230
,,,and one day later,

808
00:49:06.790 --> 00:49:10.150
l don't wanna just do random dating,
Carol, l wanna be in love,


809
00:49:10.310 --> 00:49:12.870
l wanna wake up next to someone
and see them smile,


810
00:49:13.190 --> 00:49:16.270
Do the whole Sunday breakfast thing,
go out and get the paper,


811
00:49:16.430 --> 00:49:19.110
Stay in bed together all day,

812
00:49:19.590 --> 00:49:21.510
Wouldn't we all?

813
00:49:27.550 --> 00:49:32.390
Man, this is absolutely gorgeous, l love
this, l can't believe you built it yourself,


814
00:49:32.550 --> 00:49:34.470
Yeah, handcrafted, Hand-carved,

815
00:49:34.710 --> 00:49:36.950
l hope you'll find
that it's more than a boat,


816
00:49:37.110 --> 00:49:38.430
lt's a time machine,

817
00:49:38.590 --> 00:49:40.990
-l love it, l want it, l'll take it,
-Great,


818
00:49:41.350 --> 00:49:42.990
Did you race a lot in college?

819
00:49:43.150 --> 00:49:46.310
l don't plan to race it,
Could you cut it in half for me?


820
00:49:47.030 --> 00:49:49.270
-Excuse me?
-Yeah, cut it in half lengthwise,


821
00:49:49.430 --> 00:49:52.030
l think it would be easier
to mount on the wall that way,


822
00:49:52.190 --> 00:49:53.590
You want to mount the boat?

823
00:49:53.790 --> 00:49:57.350
Yeah, l thought l'd put it in the den,
lt'd look great above my big screen,


824
00:49:57.510 --> 00:50:01.190
You know, l think maybe you should go
to lKEA and buy a canoe,


825
00:50:01.590 --> 00:50:03.830
lt's not for sale in that way,

826
00:50:04.070 --> 00:50:06.110
-He's kidding, right?
-Wouldn't that be nice,


827
00:50:06.270 --> 00:50:08.270
l've had this dream
that it'll end up wet,


828
00:50:08.470 --> 00:50:11.830
lt's just not for sale in that way
at this time, Ever, really,


829
00:50:11.990 --> 00:50:14.870
Okay, Well, if you change your mind,
l really do want it,


830
00:50:15.030 --> 00:50:18.110
Yeah, if l change my personality,
l'll let you know what l become,


831
00:50:18.430 --> 00:50:20.790
-Okay,
-Thanks so much,


832
00:50:21.270 --> 00:50:23.070
-Nice guy,
-Stanley owes me a big favor,


833
00:50:23.230 --> 00:50:25.150
-lt was a guaranteed sale,
-So what?


834
00:50:25.310 --> 00:50:27.430
Right, You can afford to be picky,
You sold,,,


835
00:50:27.630 --> 00:50:29.710
,,,let's see, no boats, 
No boats at all,

836
00:50:29.870 --> 00:50:32.830
You worry too much,
You really do,


837
00:50:32.990 --> 00:50:35.870
You're in a good mood,
That must have been some date,


838
00:50:36.070 --> 00:50:37.910
Charlie, you should have
seen this girl,


839
00:50:38.270 --> 00:50:42.030
She's shy, she's fragile,
she's self-conscious,


840
00:50:42.190 --> 00:50:47.110
She has no idea how beautiful she is,
She's a mess, lt's fantastic,


841
00:50:47.750 --> 00:50:50.910
The evening didn't end up great,
but there were moments in there,,,


842
00:50:51.110 --> 00:50:53.470
,,,where we were completely
and utterly ourselves,


843
00:50:53.630 --> 00:50:56.590
l was completely psychotic,
but she was completely lovely,


844
00:50:56.790 --> 00:50:59.750
Are you thinking about completely
closing the sale any time soon?


845
00:50:59.950 --> 00:51:02.350
l tell you about a night
with an unusual woman,,,


846
00:51:02.510 --> 00:51:04.670
,,,and you turn it
into a business transaction,


847
00:51:04.830 --> 00:51:06.590
We're not selling real estate here,

848
00:51:06.750 --> 00:51:10.030
-And if we were selling real estate?
-We'd be in escrow this weekend,


849
00:51:19.710 --> 00:51:21.790
l see Dad's not alone,

850
00:51:21.950 --> 00:51:23.870
Never, Not our dad,
