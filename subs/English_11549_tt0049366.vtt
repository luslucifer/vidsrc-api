1
00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:56.088
Dr. Hill.

2
00:01:56.088 --> 00:01:57.556
Dr. Bassett.

3
00:01:57.556 --> 00:01:59.058
Where's the patient?

4
00:01:59.058 --> 00:02:01.394
I hated
to drag you out of bed.


5
00:02:01.394 --> 00:02:03.696
Will you let me go
while there's still time?


6
00:02:03.696 --> 00:02:05.687
You'll soon see why I did.

7
00:02:07.501 --> 00:02:10.838
Will you tell
these fools I'm not crazy?


8
00:02:10.838 --> 00:02:13.007
Make them listen to me
before it's too late!


9
00:02:13.007 --> 00:02:15.009
I'll listen to you.

10
00:02:15.009 --> 00:02:16.375
Let him go.

11
00:02:20.115 --> 00:02:21.383
Who are you?

12
00:02:21.383 --> 00:02:23.885
I'm Dr. Hill
from the state mental hospital.


13
00:02:23.885 --> 00:02:25.521
I'm not insane!

14
00:02:25.521 --> 00:02:27.023
Let him go!

15
00:02:27.023 --> 00:02:30.126
Doctor,
now you must listen to me.


16
00:02:30.126 --> 00:02:31.527
You must understand me.

17
00:02:31.527 --> 00:02:34.331
I am a doctor, too.
I am not insane.


18
00:02:34.331 --> 00:02:35.799
All right.

19
00:02:35.799 --> 00:02:40.031
Suppose we sit down,
and you tell me what happened?


20
00:02:43.041 --> 00:02:45.543
Well, it started--

21
00:02:45.543 --> 00:02:48.046
for me,
it started last Thursday...


22
00:02:48.046 --> 00:02:51.550
in response to an urgent
message from my nurse.


23
00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:55.554
I'd hurried home
from a medical convention.


24
00:02:55.554 --> 00:02:59.082
At first glance,
everything looked the same.


25
00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:01.757
It wasn't.

26
00:03:02.429 --> 00:03:05.557
Something evil had taken
possession of the town.


27
00:03:06.599 --> 00:03:08.069
These two.

28
00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:09.570
Here you are.

29
00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:12.006
Thank you, sir.
There you are.


30
00:03:12.006 --> 00:03:13.496
Thank you.

31
00:03:16.511 --> 00:03:18.274
Morning, Mr. Fisher.

32
00:03:19.514 --> 00:03:21.016
Doc!

33
00:03:21.016 --> 00:03:22.517
Hiya, Sally.

34
00:03:22.517 --> 00:03:25.021
Hi. Welcome home.
I'm glad you're back.


35
00:03:25.021 --> 00:03:26.722
How's Mickey and the baby?

36
00:03:26.722 --> 00:03:29.992
Fine, but everybody else
in Santa Mira needs a doctor.


37
00:03:29.992 --> 00:03:31.527
You've got an office
full of patients.


38
00:03:31.527 --> 00:03:33.330
Oh, no.
On my first day back?


39
00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:35.766
Some of them have
been waiting for two weeks.


40
00:03:35.766 --> 00:03:37.868
Why didn't you send them
to Pursey or Carmichael?


41
00:03:37.868 --> 00:03:41.038
Most of 'em wouldn't go.
They want to see you.


42
00:03:41.038 --> 00:03:42.529
Oh?

43
00:03:49.347 --> 00:03:50.583
What's the matter with them?

44
00:03:50.583 --> 00:03:51.951
They wouldn't say.

45
00:03:51.951 --> 00:03:55.250
Usually people can't talk enough
about what's ailing them.


46
00:03:55.754 --> 00:03:58.257
For instance,
Wally Eberhard was in twice...


47
00:03:58.257 --> 00:04:00.927
and called three times,
but he wouldn't say about what.


48
00:04:00.927 --> 00:04:02.095
That's funny.

49
00:04:02.095 --> 00:04:03.797
Nobody would talk--
from Becky Driscoll...


50
00:04:03.797 --> 00:04:06.299
down to that fat
traffic cop Sam Janzek.


51
00:04:06.299 --> 00:04:10.138
Becky Driscoll?
I thought she was in England.


52
00:04:10.138 --> 00:04:14.642
She got back a few days ago,
and she wanted to see you.


53
00:04:14.642 --> 00:04:16.578
Are you still interested?

54
00:04:16.578 --> 00:04:19.581
My interest in married women
is strictly professional...


55
00:04:19.581 --> 00:04:22.584
or yours would have been
a lost cause long ago.


56
00:04:22.584 --> 00:04:25.255
-How was the convention?
-Wonderful.


57
00:04:25.255 --> 00:04:27.917
They wept with envy
when I read my paper.


58
00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:31.861
Come back here!

59
00:04:31.861 --> 00:04:33.021
Jimmy!

60
00:04:34.031 --> 00:04:37.468
What's the matter,
Mrs. Grimaldi?


61
00:04:37.468 --> 00:04:39.527
It's nothing. He just don't
want to go to school.


62
00:04:41.705 --> 00:04:45.043
If I were you, I'd have
a talk with his teacher.


63
00:04:45.043 --> 00:04:47.045
I will when I get time.

64
00:04:47.045 --> 00:04:49.147
What's the matter?
Has Joe been sick?


65
00:04:49.147 --> 00:04:51.250
No.
We gave the stand up.


66
00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:53.586
-Too much work.
-Oh.


67
00:04:53.586 --> 00:04:55.454
The boy's
panic should have told me...


68
00:04:55.454 --> 00:04:57.657
it was more than school
he was afraid of...


69
00:04:57.657 --> 00:04:59.292
and that littered,
closed-up vegetable stand...


70
00:04:59.292 --> 00:05:01.595
should have
told me something, too.


71
00:05:01.595 --> 00:05:03.063
When I last saw it,
less than a month ago...


72
00:05:03.063 --> 00:05:05.699
it was the cleanest
and busiest stand on the road.


73
00:05:05.699 --> 00:05:07.434
That's strange.

74
00:05:07.434 --> 00:05:10.004
She was in to see you, too--
last Friday.


75
00:05:10.004 --> 00:05:12.740
I tried to get her to see
Doc Pursey, but she wouldn't.


76
00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:14.909
She said only you
could help her.


77
00:05:14.909 --> 00:05:16.144
Whatever it was...

78
00:05:16.144 --> 00:05:19.444
it couldn't have been
too serious, I guess.


79
00:05:22.451 --> 00:05:24.954
One minor concussion,
two cases of the common cold...


80
00:05:24.954 --> 00:05:26.957
and six canceled appointments.

81
00:05:26.957 --> 00:05:29.459
Looks like you rushed me here
for nothing.


82
00:05:29.459 --> 00:05:31.962
I don't understand it.
They couldn't wait to see you.


83
00:05:31.962 --> 00:05:34.465
But you're still booked up solid
for the afternoon.


84
00:05:34.465 --> 00:05:38.236
I bet they don't show.
Look, there's Wally Eberhard...


85
00:05:38.236 --> 00:05:40.438
talking somebody
into buying some insurance.


86
00:05:40.438 --> 00:05:41.672
There's nothing wrong with him.

87
00:05:41.672 --> 00:05:43.038
Bill Bitner's taking
his secretary to lunch.


88
00:05:44.243 --> 00:05:45.711
And speaking of lunch...

89
00:05:45.711 --> 00:05:48.313
will you tell whoever that is
that I'm out having mine?


90
00:05:48.313 --> 00:05:49.481
Is Dr. Bennell in?

91
00:05:49.481 --> 00:05:51.417
Yes, he's here.

92
00:05:51.417 --> 00:05:53.186
Do you suppose
he has time to see me?


93
00:05:53.186 --> 00:05:55.054
If he hasn't,
something's wrong with him.


94
00:05:55.054 --> 00:05:56.248
Go right in.

95
00:05:58.057 --> 00:05:59.685
Becky.

96
00:06:01.762 --> 00:06:03.330
Almost five years.

97
00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:04.598
It's wonderful to be home again.

98
00:06:04.598 --> 00:06:05.833
I've been away so long...

99
00:06:05.833 --> 00:06:08.428
I feel almost like a stranger
in my own country.


100
00:06:09.437 --> 00:06:11.573
Hope you don't mind my coming
without an appointment.


101
00:06:11.573 --> 00:06:13.808
Not at all.
What'll you have?


102
00:06:13.808 --> 00:06:15.543
We're pushing appendectomies
this week.


103
00:06:15.543 --> 00:06:16.711
Oh, Miles.

104
00:06:16.711 --> 00:06:19.015
I don't know,
maybe I clown around too much.


105
00:06:19.015 --> 00:06:21.017
Pretty soon, my patients...

106
00:06:21.017 --> 00:06:23.519
won't trust me
to prescribe aspirin for them.


107
00:06:23.519 --> 00:06:25.021
Seriously, what's the trouble?

108
00:06:25.021 --> 00:06:27.190
It's my cousin.

109
00:06:27.190 --> 00:06:29.158
Wilma?
What's the matter with her?


110
00:06:30.527 --> 00:06:32.229
She has a...

111
00:06:32.229 --> 00:06:34.866
I guess you'd call it
a delusion.


112
00:06:34.866 --> 00:06:37.235
You know her uncle?
Uncle Ira?


113
00:06:37.235 --> 00:06:38.836
Sure. I'm his doctor.

114
00:06:38.836 --> 00:06:41.873
She's got herself
thinking he isn't her uncle.


115
00:06:41.873 --> 00:06:43.709
How do you mean?
That they're not really related?


116
00:06:43.709 --> 00:06:46.412
She thinks
he's an impostor or something...


117
00:06:46.412 --> 00:06:48.314
someone who only looks like Ira.

118
00:06:48.314 --> 00:06:49.715
Have you seen him?

119
00:06:49.715 --> 00:06:50.949
I just came from there.

120
00:06:50.949 --> 00:06:54.454
Is he Uncle Ira,
or isn't he Uncle Ira?


121
00:06:54.454 --> 00:06:55.622
Of course he is.

122
00:06:55.622 --> 00:06:57.724
I told Wilma that,
but it was no use.


123
00:06:57.724 --> 00:07:00.494
Please, would you stop by
and have a talk with her?


124
00:07:00.494 --> 00:07:02.063
Sally says I'm booked up
for the afternoon...


125
00:07:02.063 --> 00:07:04.732
but why don't you ask her
to come in and see me?


126
00:07:04.732 --> 00:07:06.222
I'll try.

127
00:07:07.735 --> 00:07:09.604
How about some lunch?

128
00:07:09.604 --> 00:07:11.936
I can't.
I'm meeting Dad at the store.


129
00:07:15.911 --> 00:07:17.880
When did you get back?

130
00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:20.550
I came back from London
two months ago.


131
00:07:20.550 --> 00:07:21.984
I've been in Reno.

132
00:07:21.984 --> 00:07:23.152
Reno?

133
00:07:23.152 --> 00:07:25.021
Reno.

134
00:07:25.021 --> 00:07:26.523
Dad tells me
you were there, too.


135
00:07:26.523 --> 00:07:28.025
Five months ago.

136
00:07:28.025 --> 00:07:30.027
Oh, I'm sorry.

137
00:07:30.027 --> 00:07:31.528
So was I.

138
00:07:31.528 --> 00:07:34.031
I wanted it to work.

139
00:07:34.031 --> 00:07:37.469
I guess that makes us
lodge brothers now.


140
00:07:37.469 --> 00:07:38.670
Yes.

141
00:07:38.670 --> 00:07:41.740
Except I'm paying dues
while you collect them.


142
00:07:41.740 --> 00:07:43.902
Ha ha ha! Miles.

143
00:07:51.550 --> 00:07:53.387
-Hello, doc.
-How are you?


144
00:07:53.387 --> 00:07:54.554
Sam!

145
00:07:54.554 --> 00:07:56.556
At it again, eh?

146
00:07:56.556 --> 00:07:57.891
My nurse tells me
you were in last week...


147
00:07:57.891 --> 00:08:00.060
and wanted very much
to see me.


148
00:08:00.060 --> 00:08:02.052
It wasn't anything important.

149
00:08:03.064 --> 00:08:05.066
Didn't he go to college with us?

150
00:08:05.066 --> 00:08:07.068
Quit his second year
to get married...


151
00:08:07.068 --> 00:08:09.571
like I wanted us to do.

152
00:08:09.571 --> 00:08:12.174
Just be thankful
I didn't take you seriously.


153
00:08:12.174 --> 00:08:13.709
You be thankful.

154
00:08:13.709 --> 00:08:15.177
I found out
that a doctor's wife...


155
00:08:15.177 --> 00:08:16.879
needs the understanding
of an Einstein...


156
00:08:16.879 --> 00:08:18.515
and patience of a saint.

157
00:08:18.515 --> 00:08:20.016
And love?

158
00:08:20.016 --> 00:08:22.018
I wouldn't know about that.

159
00:08:22.018 --> 00:08:24.020
I'm just a general practitioner.

160
00:08:24.020 --> 00:08:26.524
Love is handled
by the specialists.


161
00:08:26.524 --> 00:08:29.527
Here's where I leave you.

162
00:08:29.527 --> 00:08:31.028
You know something?

163
00:08:31.028 --> 00:08:34.532
This is where you left me
the last time.


164
00:08:34.532 --> 00:08:36.023
Hiya, Johnny.

165
00:08:43.208 --> 00:08:44.911
Sally, I'm off.

166
00:08:44.911 --> 00:08:47.079
Tell the answering service
I'll be at home.


167
00:08:47.079 --> 00:08:48.548
Good night, doc.

168
00:08:48.548 --> 00:08:50.650
I'm not going in there!

169
00:08:50.650 --> 00:08:53.320
Stop all this nonsense.

170
00:08:53.320 --> 00:08:56.557
Hey! Take it easy!

171
00:08:56.557 --> 00:08:58.559
Isn't this Jimmy Grimaldi?

172
00:08:58.559 --> 00:09:00.562
Yes, Doctor.
Can I talk to you a moment?


173
00:09:00.562 --> 00:09:02.497
Sure. I almost
ran you down this morning.


174
00:09:02.497 --> 00:09:04.566
You got to be careful
when you run out in the road.


175
00:09:04.566 --> 00:09:06.067
Come on.

176
00:09:06.067 --> 00:09:07.557
Come on.

177
00:09:11.073 --> 00:09:13.008
Hey! Hey! Hey!

178
00:09:13.008 --> 00:09:15.511
Hey! Slow down now.

179
00:09:15.511 --> 00:09:17.246
School isn't as bad as all that.

180
00:09:17.246 --> 00:09:18.815
School isn't what upsets him.

181
00:09:18.815 --> 00:09:20.183
It's my daughter-in-law.

182
00:09:20.183 --> 00:09:22.686
He's got the crazy idea
she isn't his mother.


183
00:09:22.686 --> 00:09:24.187
She isn't! She isn't!

184
00:09:24.187 --> 00:09:25.789
Don't let her get me!

185
00:09:25.789 --> 00:09:28.918
Nobody's going
to get you, Jimmy.


186
00:09:35.434 --> 00:09:37.102
How long has this been going on?

187
00:09:37.102 --> 00:09:39.872
An hour ago,
I found him in the cellar.


188
00:09:39.872 --> 00:09:43.208
He wouldn't say anything until
I started to phone his mother.


189
00:09:43.208 --> 00:09:45.044
That's when he said Anna
wasn't his mother.


190
00:09:45.044 --> 00:09:47.547
Could you keep him
with you for a day or so?


191
00:09:47.547 --> 00:09:50.183
Give him one of these every
four hours during the day.


192
00:09:50.183 --> 00:09:52.051
Call me tomorrow and let me know
how he's feeling.


193
00:09:52.051 --> 00:09:53.554
Yes, Doctor, thank you.

194
00:09:53.554 --> 00:09:55.723
Don't let her get me!

195
00:09:55.723 --> 00:09:57.748
Nobody's going to get you.

196
00:10:04.533 --> 00:10:06.067
All right, Jimmy.

197
00:10:06.067 --> 00:10:07.569
Open your mouth.

198
00:10:07.569 --> 00:10:09.070
Shut your eyes.

199
00:10:09.070 --> 00:10:11.173
In the words of the poet...

200
00:10:11.173 --> 00:10:13.109
I'll give you something
to make you wise.


201
00:10:13.109 --> 00:10:16.579
That's a good boy, Jimmy.

202
00:10:16.579 --> 00:10:18.615
I'm not going home ever.

203
00:10:18.615 --> 00:10:20.951
You're staying at your
grandmother's. Call his mother.


204
00:10:20.951 --> 00:10:22.286
She's not my mother!

205
00:10:22.286 --> 00:10:24.621
All right. Run along.
Everything's going to be OK.


206
00:10:24.621 --> 00:10:26.156
You be a good boy now.

207
00:10:26.156 --> 00:10:27.592
Good night, Doctor.

208
00:10:27.592 --> 00:10:28.786
Good night.

209
00:10:30.461 --> 00:10:33.131
I've changed my mind.
I'm not going directly home.


210
00:10:33.131 --> 00:10:34.599
I'm going to stop off
and see Wilma Lentz.


211
00:10:34.599 --> 00:10:36.302
Should I call the boy's mother?

212
00:10:36.302 --> 00:10:38.304
Yes.
Tell her what happened...


213
00:10:38.304 --> 00:10:40.472
and that I suggested
the boy spend the night...


214
00:10:40.472 --> 00:10:42.133
at his grandmother's house.

215
00:10:50.116 --> 00:10:51.618
Hello, Miles.

216
00:10:51.618 --> 00:10:54.088
Nice to see you, Wilma.
Becky.


217
00:10:54.088 --> 00:10:55.523
Let's have it.

218
00:10:55.523 --> 00:10:57.191
You talked to him.
What do you think?


219
00:10:57.191 --> 00:10:58.426
It's him.

220
00:10:58.426 --> 00:11:00.494
He's your Uncle Ira, all right.

221
00:11:00.494 --> 00:11:02.019
He is not.

222
00:11:09.671 --> 00:11:11.641
How is he different?

223
00:11:11.641 --> 00:11:12.775
That's just it.

224
00:11:12.775 --> 00:11:15.778
There is no difference
you can actually see.


225
00:11:15.778 --> 00:11:18.114
He looks, sounds, acts,
and remembers...


226
00:11:18.114 --> 00:11:19.316
like Uncle Ira.

227
00:11:19.316 --> 00:11:20.884
Then he is your Uncle Ira.

228
00:11:20.884 --> 00:11:24.288
Can't you see that?
No matter how you feel, he is.


229
00:11:24.288 --> 00:11:26.790
But he isn't.
There's something missing.


230
00:11:26.790 --> 00:11:30.161
He's been a father to me
since I was a baby.


231
00:11:30.161 --> 00:11:31.730
Always when he talked to me...

232
00:11:31.730 --> 00:11:35.367
there was a special look
in his eye.


233
00:11:35.367 --> 00:11:36.669
That look's gone.

234
00:11:36.669 --> 00:11:39.472
What about memories?
There must be certain things...


235
00:11:39.472 --> 00:11:41.941
that only you and he
would know about.


236
00:11:41.941 --> 00:11:43.109
Oh, there are.

237
00:11:43.109 --> 00:11:45.545
I've talked to him about them.
He remembers them all...


238
00:11:45.545 --> 00:11:48.810
down to the last small detail,
just like Uncle Ira would.


239
00:11:50.617 --> 00:11:52.119
But, Miles...

240
00:11:52.119 --> 00:11:53.621
there's no emotion.

241
00:11:53.621 --> 00:11:54.789
None!

242
00:11:54.789 --> 00:11:57.625
Just the pretense of it.

243
00:11:57.625 --> 00:11:59.627
The words, gesture,
the tone of voice...


244
00:11:59.627 --> 00:12:02.597
everything else is the same,
but not the feeling.


245
00:12:04.433 --> 00:12:06.902
Memories or not,
he isn't my Uncle Ira.


246
00:12:06.902 --> 00:12:08.971
Wilma, I'm on your side.

247
00:12:08.971 --> 00:12:10.740
My business
is people in trouble...


248
00:12:10.740 --> 00:12:12.175
and I'm going to find
a way to help you.


249
00:12:12.175 --> 00:12:14.944
No one could possibly
impersonate your Uncle Ira...


250
00:12:14.944 --> 00:12:17.547
without you
or your Aunt Eleda or even me...


251
00:12:17.547 --> 00:12:19.550
seeing a million
little differences.


252
00:12:19.550 --> 00:12:21.619
I want you to realize that.

253
00:12:21.619 --> 00:12:23.754
Think about it,
and then you'll know...


254
00:12:23.754 --> 00:12:27.058
that the trouble is inside you.

255
00:12:27.058 --> 00:12:29.528
Wilma, where are you?

256
00:12:29.528 --> 00:12:31.430
Out on the lawn.

257
00:12:31.430 --> 00:12:33.331
Say nothing to her.

258
00:12:33.331 --> 00:12:36.269
Why, Miles,
I didn't know you were here.


259
00:12:36.269 --> 00:12:37.470
Welcome home.

260
00:12:37.470 --> 00:12:38.705
Hello, Mrs. Lentz.

261
00:12:38.705 --> 00:12:40.873
Did you ask Miles
to stay for dinner?


262
00:12:40.873 --> 00:12:42.041
Can't tonight.

263
00:12:42.041 --> 00:12:43.309
I'm making spoon bread.

264
00:12:43.309 --> 00:12:44.812
Please, don't tempt me.

265
00:12:44.812 --> 00:12:46.046
Maybe next time.

266
00:12:46.046 --> 00:12:48.048
Wilma, where are my glasses?

267
00:12:48.048 --> 00:12:49.983
I think
they're on the mantelpiece.


268
00:12:49.983 --> 00:12:51.314
I'll go with you.

269
00:13:02.565 --> 00:13:04.567
Am I going crazy?

270
00:13:04.567 --> 00:13:06.569
Don't spare me.
I've got to know.


271
00:13:06.569 --> 00:13:08.571
No, you're not.
Even these days...


272
00:13:08.571 --> 00:13:11.241
it isn't as easy to go crazy
as you might think.


273
00:13:11.241 --> 00:13:13.009
But you don't have to be
losing your mind...


274
00:13:13.009 --> 00:13:15.445
to need psychiatric help.

275
00:13:15.445 --> 00:13:17.981
I'd like you to see
a doctor friend of mine.


276
00:13:17.981 --> 00:13:20.818
-A psychiatrist?
-Dan Kauffman.


277
00:13:20.818 --> 00:13:24.686
I'll make an appointment
for you tomorrow.


278
00:13:26.124 --> 00:13:28.227
All right.

279
00:13:28.227 --> 00:13:30.752
But it's a waste of time.
There's nothing wrong with me.


280
00:13:35.134 --> 00:13:38.127
Better break this up,
or he'll start wondering.


281
00:13:40.039 --> 00:13:41.274
Wondering what?

282
00:13:41.274 --> 00:13:43.810
If I don't suspect.
You've been a big help...


283
00:13:43.810 --> 00:13:46.647
and I don't want either of you
to worry about me.


284
00:13:46.647 --> 00:13:47.882
I'll be all right.

285
00:13:47.882 --> 00:13:49.450
Sure you will.

286
00:13:49.450 --> 00:13:51.552
Staying here, Becky?
Or may I drive you home?


287
00:13:51.552 --> 00:13:53.087
Would you like me to stay?

288
00:13:53.087 --> 00:13:55.891
Of course not.
Good night.


289
00:13:55.891 --> 00:13:57.381
Good night.

290
00:14:07.670 --> 00:14:10.072
Nice having Becky
back again, eh, boy?


291
00:14:10.072 --> 00:14:11.563
Sure is.

292
00:14:16.446 --> 00:14:17.781
In the back of my mind...

293
00:14:17.781 --> 00:14:19.551
a warning bell was ringing.

294
00:14:19.551 --> 00:14:21.286
Sick people
who couldn't wait to see me...


295
00:14:21.286 --> 00:14:23.288
then suddenly
were perfectly all right.


296
00:14:23.288 --> 00:14:25.590
A boy claiming
his mother wasn't his mother.


297
00:14:25.590 --> 00:14:27.659
A woman claiming her uncle
wasn't her uncle.


298
00:14:27.659 --> 00:14:29.028
But I didn't listen.

299
00:14:29.028 --> 00:14:30.963
Obviously, the boy's mother
was his mother.


300
00:14:30.963 --> 00:14:34.099
I had seen her.
And Uncle Ira was Uncle Ira.


301
00:14:34.099 --> 00:14:36.235
There was no doubt of that
after I talked to him.


302
00:14:36.235 --> 00:14:38.538
Miles, he is Ira?

303
00:14:38.538 --> 00:14:41.308
Of course he is.
What do you mean?


304
00:14:41.308 --> 00:14:43.476
It's just Wilma's so positive.

305
00:14:43.476 --> 00:14:45.046
Will she be all right?

306
00:14:45.046 --> 00:14:46.547
I think so.

307
00:14:46.547 --> 00:14:48.482
I'm a doctor,
according to my diploma...


308
00:14:48.482 --> 00:14:50.918
but I don't really know
what Wilma's trouble is.


309
00:14:50.918 --> 00:14:53.221
I could start talking
psychiatrical jargon...


310
00:14:53.221 --> 00:14:56.214
but it's out of my line
and in Dan Kauffman's.


311
00:14:57.993 --> 00:15:00.495
I wish you didn't have
to go home for dinner.


312
00:15:00.495 --> 00:15:03.488
I don't.
Dad's eating out with a friend.


313
00:15:04.500 --> 00:15:07.070
I could pick you up
at 7:00.


314
00:15:07.070 --> 00:15:08.571
Well...

315
00:15:08.571 --> 00:15:11.175
It's summer,
and the moon is full.


316
00:15:11.175 --> 00:15:12.376
"I know a bank...

317
00:15:12.376 --> 00:15:15.212
MILES,
"where the wild thyme grows."


318
00:15:15.212 --> 00:15:16.907
You haven't changed a bit.

319
00:15:31.030 --> 00:15:32.798
Whup! Whoa! Watch out!

320
00:15:32.798 --> 00:15:34.033
Sorry.

321
00:15:34.033 --> 00:15:36.402
Hey, Miles,
when did you get back?


322
00:15:36.402 --> 00:15:37.638
This morning.
How are you, Danny?


323
00:15:37.638 --> 00:15:38.805
This is Miss Driscoll.

324
00:15:38.805 --> 00:15:40.741
Dr. Kauffman--
our one and only psychiatrist.


325
00:15:40.741 --> 00:15:42.943
Watch out what you say.
Ed, you remember Becky.


326
00:15:42.943 --> 00:15:44.478
I should.
I brought her into the world.


327
00:15:44.478 --> 00:15:45.980
You did us all a favor.

328
00:15:45.980 --> 00:15:47.749
This saves me a phone call.

329
00:15:47.749 --> 00:15:50.518
I've got a kid and a woman
who need a witch doctor.


330
00:15:50.518 --> 00:15:52.253
Boy says his father
isn't his father...


331
00:15:52.253 --> 00:15:54.390
and the woman says her sister
isn't her sister?


332
00:15:54.390 --> 00:15:55.991
That's pretty close.

333
00:15:55.991 --> 00:15:57.993
I knew you'd been
studying hypnosis...


334
00:15:57.993 --> 00:15:59.795
but when did you start
reading minds?


335
00:15:59.795 --> 00:16:01.297
He doesn't have to read them.

336
00:16:01.297 --> 00:16:03.266
I've sent him a dozen patients
since it started.


337
00:16:03.266 --> 00:16:05.302
What is it?
What's going on?


338
00:16:05.302 --> 00:16:07.804
I don't know.
A strange neurosis...


339
00:16:07.804 --> 00:16:10.607
evidently contagious--
an epidemic of mass hysteria.


340
00:16:10.607 --> 00:16:12.405
In two weeks,
it's spread all over town.


341
00:16:13.511 --> 00:16:14.812
What causes it?

342
00:16:14.812 --> 00:16:17.440
Worry about
what's going on in the world.


343
00:16:19.083 --> 00:16:21.086
Make room
for Wilma Lentz tomorrow.


344
00:16:21.086 --> 00:16:23.722
Send her in around 2:00.
Good night.


345
00:16:23.722 --> 00:16:24.882
So long, Danny.

346
00:16:29.963 --> 00:16:33.533
This is the oddest thing
I ever heard of.


347
00:16:33.533 --> 00:16:35.468
Let's hope we don't catch it.

348
00:16:35.468 --> 00:16:37.471
I'd hate to wake up
some morning...


349
00:16:37.471 --> 00:16:39.139
and find out you weren't you.

350
00:16:39.139 --> 00:16:41.475
I'm not the high-school
kid you used to romance.


351
00:16:41.475 --> 00:16:42.710
How could you tell?

352
00:16:42.710 --> 00:16:43.877
You really want to know?

353
00:16:43.877 --> 00:16:45.037
Mm-hmm.

354
00:16:51.987 --> 00:16:54.650
Mmm.
You're Becky Driscoll.


355
00:16:57.059 --> 00:16:59.061
Hey, Santa Mira's looking up.

356
00:16:59.061 --> 00:17:01.564
Has ever since you got back.

357
00:17:01.564 --> 00:17:04.568
Is this an example
of your bedside manner, Doctor?


358
00:17:04.568 --> 00:17:07.059
No, ma'am.
That comes later.


359
00:17:17.949 --> 00:17:19.450
Good evening, Doctor.

360
00:17:19.450 --> 00:17:21.420
What happened
to the crowd tonight?


361
00:17:21.420 --> 00:17:24.048
I don't know.
It's been this way for weeks.


362
00:17:25.557 --> 00:17:28.293
At least we don't
have to wait for a table.


363
00:17:28.293 --> 00:17:30.563
Take your pick.
Here or here.


364
00:17:30.563 --> 00:17:32.399
Here, I think.
Shall we?


365
00:17:32.399 --> 00:17:33.566
Mm-hmm.

366
00:17:33.566 --> 00:17:34.968
Where's the band?

367
00:17:34.968 --> 00:17:37.972
Business slumped,
so I had to let them go.


368
00:17:37.972 --> 00:17:39.240
There's the jukebox, though.

369
00:17:39.240 --> 00:17:41.008
Shall we dance?

370
00:17:41.008 --> 00:17:42.977
I hope you didn't
let the bartender go.


371
00:17:42.977 --> 00:17:44.979
I'm the bartender.
Martinis?


372
00:17:44.979 --> 00:17:46.811
Two. Dry.

373
00:17:47.983 --> 00:17:50.144
Very dry.

374
00:17:51.486 --> 00:17:54.222
Miles, I don't care
what Dr. Kauffman says.


375
00:17:54.222 --> 00:17:55.491
I'm worried.

376
00:17:55.491 --> 00:17:57.260
You are in the capable hands...

377
00:17:57.260 --> 00:17:59.495
of your personal physician.

378
00:17:59.495 --> 00:18:00.997
Oh, Doctor.

379
00:18:00.997 --> 00:18:03.500
Ah, there's our evening.

380
00:18:03.500 --> 00:18:04.990
Sorry.

381
00:18:07.571 --> 00:18:09.506
Thanks.

382
00:18:09.506 --> 00:18:11.008
Dr. Bennell.

383
00:18:11.008 --> 00:18:14.612
Jack Belicec wants you
to come to his house right away.


384
00:18:14.612 --> 00:18:16.448
He says it's urgent.

385
00:18:16.448 --> 00:18:18.439
Thank you.

386
00:18:19.951 --> 00:18:21.954
Better hold those drinks.

387
00:18:21.954 --> 00:18:23.122
Emergency.

388
00:18:23.122 --> 00:18:25.624
At least they called
before we ordered dinner.


389
00:18:25.624 --> 00:18:26.792
How hungry are you?

390
00:18:26.792 --> 00:18:28.094
I can wait.

391
00:18:28.094 --> 00:18:29.463
It may be a while.

392
00:18:29.463 --> 00:18:30.964
I'll go with you.

393
00:18:30.964 --> 00:18:32.955
Sorry.
We'll be back later.


394
00:18:47.983 --> 00:18:49.974
There's Jack.

395
00:19:02.765 --> 00:19:04.368
What's the matter?
Teddy sick?


396
00:19:04.368 --> 00:19:06.103
No.

397
00:19:06.103 --> 00:19:08.372
Thank heaven.
I thought you'd never arrive.


398
00:19:08.372 --> 00:19:09.773
Then who is sick?

399
00:19:09.773 --> 00:19:11.008
Nobody.

400
00:19:11.008 --> 00:19:13.812
Then why'd you
drag me away from my dinner?


401
00:19:13.812 --> 00:19:15.981
You won't believe it
until you see it.


402
00:19:15.981 --> 00:19:17.282
Hello, Becky.

403
00:19:17.282 --> 00:19:18.874
-Hello, Becky.
-Hi, Teddy.


404
00:19:23.356 --> 00:19:25.925
Could you forget
you're a doctor a while?


405
00:19:25.925 --> 00:19:27.193
Why?

406
00:19:27.193 --> 00:19:29.296
I don't want you
calling the police.


407
00:19:29.296 --> 00:19:31.765
Quit acting like a writer.

408
00:19:31.765 --> 00:19:34.325
Maybe you can tell me.
You're the doctor.


409
00:19:44.612 --> 00:19:47.605
Miles, put the light on
over the pool table.


410
00:20:00.230 --> 00:20:01.891
Go on. Pull it down.

411
00:20:45.380 --> 00:20:47.042
What do you make of it?

412
00:20:49.051 --> 00:20:50.219
Who is he?

413
00:20:50.219 --> 00:20:52.619
I have no idea.

414
00:20:58.395 --> 00:21:01.057
Its face, Miles.
It's vague.


415
00:21:02.065 --> 00:21:04.736
Like the first impression
that's stamped on a coin.


416
00:21:04.736 --> 00:21:05.903
It isn't finished.

417
00:21:05.903 --> 00:21:07.071
You're right.

418
00:21:07.071 --> 00:21:09.073
All the features
but no details...


419
00:21:09.073 --> 00:21:10.842
no character, no lines.

420
00:21:10.842 --> 00:21:12.778
It's no dead man.

421
00:21:12.778 --> 00:21:14.780
Have you got
an ink pad around the house?


422
00:21:14.780 --> 00:21:16.849
There's one in the desk.
Why?


423
00:21:16.849 --> 00:21:19.018
I want to take
the corpse's fingerprints.


424
00:21:19.018 --> 00:21:21.321
Of course
it's a dead man.


425
00:21:21.321 --> 00:21:24.057
I don't know,
but I've got a feeling that...


426
00:21:24.057 --> 00:21:26.926
I know this sounds crazy,
but if I should do an autopsy...


427
00:21:26.926 --> 00:21:30.021
I think I'd find every organ
in perfect condition...


428
00:21:32.033 --> 00:21:35.298
as perfect
as the body is externally...


429
00:21:37.305 --> 00:21:39.308
everything in working order.

430
00:21:39.308 --> 00:21:42.368
All set to go. 
Hold that down.

431
00:21:47.984 --> 00:21:49.752
These are blank.

432
00:21:49.752 --> 00:21:52.055
Waiting for the final
finished face...


433
00:21:52.055 --> 00:21:53.690
to be stamped onto it.

434
00:21:53.690 --> 00:21:56.327
But whose face?

435
00:21:56.327 --> 00:21:58.192
Tell me that.

436
00:21:59.396 --> 00:22:01.557
We could all use a drink.

437
00:22:03.834 --> 00:22:05.136
Bourbon all right?

438
00:22:05.136 --> 00:22:06.338
Fine.

439
00:22:06.338 --> 00:22:07.906
Not for me, thanks.

440
00:22:07.906 --> 00:22:10.208
Miles, answer me.
Whose face?


441
00:22:10.208 --> 00:22:12.077
I haven't the slightest idea...

442
00:22:12.077 --> 00:22:13.379
have you?

443
00:22:13.379 --> 00:22:16.782
How tall would you say
that thing is?


444
00:22:16.782 --> 00:22:18.784
Oh, 5'10", thereabouts.

445
00:22:18.784 --> 00:22:20.786
How much does it weigh?

446
00:22:20.786 --> 00:22:24.291
It's pretty thin.
Maybe 140 pounds.


447
00:22:24.291 --> 00:22:27.556
Jack's 5'10"
and weighs 140 pounds.


448
00:22:28.795 --> 00:22:29.963
Ow!

449
00:22:29.963 --> 00:22:32.300
Teddy, will you stop
talking nonsense?


450
00:22:32.300 --> 00:22:36.304
I'm sorry, darling,
but it isn't nonsense.


451
00:22:36.304 --> 00:22:39.308
Becky, you don't think
it's nonsense, do you?


452
00:22:39.308 --> 00:22:40.676
Of course it is.

453
00:22:40.676 --> 00:22:42.311
Jack's standing here
in front of you.


454
00:22:42.311 --> 00:22:44.747
Of course I am,
bleeding to death.


455
00:22:44.747 --> 00:22:45.914
Excuse me.

456
00:22:45.914 --> 00:22:47.082
You know what?

457
00:22:47.082 --> 00:22:49.347
I'm afraid you may live.

458
00:22:50.820 --> 00:22:52.889
Here, this should fix it.

459
00:22:52.889 --> 00:22:54.824
Miles,
shouldn't we call the police...


460
00:22:54.824 --> 00:22:57.828
and have them take
that dead body out of here?


461
00:22:57.828 --> 00:23:00.831
I'm afraid
it isn't just a dead body.


462
00:23:00.831 --> 00:23:02.321
Thanks.

463
00:23:12.277 --> 00:23:13.768
I wonder if...

464
00:23:15.047 --> 00:23:16.282
What?

465
00:23:16.282 --> 00:23:18.117
I wonder
if there's any connection.


466
00:23:18.117 --> 00:23:19.886
What do you mean?

467
00:23:19.886 --> 00:23:22.289
There's something
strange afoot in Santa Mira.


468
00:23:22.289 --> 00:23:26.794
Dr. Kauffman calls it
an epidemic of mass hysteria.


469
00:23:26.794 --> 00:23:29.296
Becky's cousin's got it,
for one.


470
00:23:29.296 --> 00:23:31.533
She thinks that her uncle
and her aunt...


471
00:23:31.533 --> 00:23:33.301
aren't her uncle and her aunt.

472
00:23:33.301 --> 00:23:35.804
There's several cases
of such delusion.


473
00:23:35.804 --> 00:23:38.807
This isn't you yet...

474
00:23:38.807 --> 00:23:41.800
but there is
a structural likeness.


475
00:23:43.379 --> 00:23:44.547
It's fantastic.

476
00:23:44.547 --> 00:23:46.649
There must be some reason
this is here.


477
00:23:46.649 --> 00:23:48.652
Would you be willing
to sit up...


478
00:23:48.652 --> 00:23:50.587
and see what your friend's
next move is?


479
00:23:50.587 --> 00:23:54.057
If nothing happens by morning,
call the police.


480
00:23:54.057 --> 00:23:55.559
If something happens...

481
00:23:55.559 --> 00:23:57.395
call me, will you?

482
00:23:57.395 --> 00:23:59.056
You know I will.

483
00:24:05.337 --> 00:24:07.172
Good night.
Take it easy.


484
00:24:07.172 --> 00:24:08.340
Sure.

485
00:24:08.340 --> 00:24:09.675
Nothing will happen.

486
00:24:09.675 --> 00:24:10.909
Good night, Becky.

487
00:24:10.909 --> 00:24:12.077
If it does...

488
00:24:12.077 --> 00:24:14.979
it'll make a charming,
bloodcurdling mystery story.


489
00:24:22.857 --> 00:24:25.526
I was careful
not to let Becky know...


490
00:24:25.526 --> 00:24:26.794
but I was really scared.

491
00:24:26.794 --> 00:24:29.964
Dan Kauffman's explanation
of what was wrong in town...


492
00:24:29.964 --> 00:24:31.366
mass hysteria...

493
00:24:31.366 --> 00:24:34.358
couldn't explain away that body
on Jack's billiard table.


494
00:24:47.517 --> 00:24:50.487
Come in
while I turn the lights on.


495
00:24:50.487 --> 00:24:51.822
You're a forward wench...

496
00:24:51.822 --> 00:24:53.824
dragging me into a dark hallway
to be kissed.


497
00:24:53.824 --> 00:24:56.159
I'm dragging you
into a dark hallway...


498
00:24:56.159 --> 00:24:58.396
because I'm scared of the dark
tonight.


499
00:24:58.396 --> 00:25:00.565
I'd better stay
and tuck you in.


500
00:25:00.565 --> 00:25:02.089
That way lies madness.

501
00:25:04.135 --> 00:25:05.971
What's wrong with madness?

502
00:25:05.971 --> 00:25:07.802
Madness.
Now good night.


503
00:25:15.782 --> 00:25:18.785
It's about time
you two got home.


504
00:25:18.785 --> 00:25:21.721
Dad, what are you doing
in the basement this late?


505
00:25:21.721 --> 00:25:23.124
Working in my shop.

506
00:25:23.124 --> 00:25:24.358
Want a nightcap, doc?

507
00:25:24.358 --> 00:25:25.693
No, thanks.
It's kind of late.


508
00:25:25.693 --> 00:25:27.795
I'll take a rain check.
Good night.


509
00:25:27.795 --> 00:25:29.297
Good night.

510
00:25:29.297 --> 00:25:30.798
Good night.

511
00:25:30.798 --> 00:25:32.790
Good night, Miles.

512
00:26:04.736 --> 00:26:06.672
Aaah!

513
00:26:06.672 --> 00:26:08.341
Look, Jack!

514
00:26:08.341 --> 00:26:10.343
It's you! It's you!

515
00:26:10.343 --> 00:26:12.278
No, no!
You mustn't go near it!


516
00:26:12.278 --> 00:26:14.281
Get out of here! Please!

517
00:26:14.281 --> 00:26:15.771
Please!

518
00:26:16.783 --> 00:26:18.250
Miles!

519
00:26:19.786 --> 00:26:21.288
What happened, Jack?

520
00:26:21.288 --> 00:26:23.791
Teddy says the thing
in our place is me...


521
00:26:23.791 --> 00:26:26.694
right down
to the cut on my hand.


522
00:26:26.694 --> 00:26:28.129
I didn't wait to look.

523
00:26:28.129 --> 00:26:30.298
It's alive! It's alive!

524
00:26:30.298 --> 00:26:32.801
The hand was cut and bleeding!

525
00:26:32.801 --> 00:26:35.804
And the position
of the body had changed!


526
00:26:35.804 --> 00:26:37.533
Here, here. Take this.

527
00:26:42.312 --> 00:26:43.939
I'll call Danny Kauffman.

528
00:27:03.602 --> 00:27:04.770
Hello?

529
00:27:04.770 --> 00:27:05.972
Hello, Danny?

530
00:27:05.972 --> 00:27:07.140
Yeah?

531
00:27:07.140 --> 00:27:09.442
Something's happened.
I've got to see you.


532
00:27:09.442 --> 00:27:11.544
Will you get over here fast?

533
00:27:11.544 --> 00:27:13.579
It's important.

534
00:27:13.579 --> 00:27:16.014
Oh...OK.

535
00:27:18.786 --> 00:27:19.953
He's on his way.

536
00:27:19.953 --> 00:27:21.789
I'll make some coffee
and be right with you.


537
00:27:21.789 --> 00:27:23.223
Good deal, Miles.
Thanks.


538
00:27:25.593 --> 00:27:28.061
What about Becky?
Do you think she's all right?


539
00:27:38.841 --> 00:27:41.545
Dad, what are you
doing in the basement this late?


540
00:27:41.545 --> 00:27:42.910
Working in my shop.

541
00:27:45.449 --> 00:27:47.250
I don't know what it was...

542
00:27:47.250 --> 00:27:48.552
call it a premonition...

543
00:27:48.552 --> 00:27:51.556
but suddenly, I had the feeling
that Becky was in danger.


544
00:27:51.556 --> 00:27:53.547
I had to get to her
as quickly as possible.


545
00:28:13.580 --> 00:28:15.716
I was going
to ring the bell...


546
00:28:15.716 --> 00:28:17.946
but then I had a hunch
I'd better be careful.


547
00:28:19.086 --> 00:28:20.849
Something was wrong
in this house.


548
00:31:10.978 --> 00:31:12.413
Becky.

549
00:31:12.413 --> 00:31:13.580
Becky!

550
00:31:13.580 --> 00:31:14.911
Becky!

551
00:31:47.452 --> 00:31:49.955
Miles, will you tell me
what happened?


552
00:31:49.955 --> 00:31:51.290
The same thing.

553
00:31:51.290 --> 00:31:52.725
I found another one...

554
00:31:52.725 --> 00:31:54.426
in the cellar
at Becky's house...


555
00:31:54.426 --> 00:31:56.962
coming to life
while I stood there watching it.


556
00:31:56.962 --> 00:31:58.465
It was Becky.

557
00:31:58.465 --> 00:32:01.301
Yeah? I want to see
one of these bodies.


558
00:32:01.301 --> 00:32:02.769
All right.

559
00:32:02.769 --> 00:32:05.638
You're going to bed,
and you're staying with her.


560
00:32:05.638 --> 00:32:07.908
Put on your clothes.
We'll go to Jack's first.


561
00:32:07.908 --> 00:32:09.410
Got any coffee around here?

562
00:32:09.410 --> 00:32:11.979
Yeah.
You'll find some in the kitchen.


563
00:32:11.979 --> 00:32:13.914
He doesn't believe me, Beck.

564
00:32:13.914 --> 00:32:16.076
He will.

565
00:32:28.097 --> 00:32:29.999
Somebody's playing games!

566
00:32:29.999 --> 00:32:32.135
Rough ones.

567
00:32:32.135 --> 00:32:34.772
There's a blood spot.

568
00:32:34.772 --> 00:32:37.307
What you saw was the body
of a murdered man.


569
00:32:37.307 --> 00:32:38.942
Did you examine it carefully?

570
00:32:38.942 --> 00:32:40.110
Yes.

571
00:32:40.110 --> 00:32:42.213
I don't know
what's happened to it.


572
00:32:42.213 --> 00:32:44.582
It wasn't an ordinary body.
There wasn't a mark on it.


573
00:32:44.582 --> 00:32:46.718
I checked it, too.
Not a scratch.


574
00:32:46.718 --> 00:32:47.952
You can kill a man...

575
00:32:47.952 --> 00:32:49.954
by shoving an ice pick
into the base of his brain...


576
00:32:49.954 --> 00:32:52.491
leaving a puncture so small
the naked eye can't see.


577
00:32:52.491 --> 00:32:55.127
You're ignoring the fact
this wasn't a normal body.


578
00:32:55.127 --> 00:32:56.829
What about the hand
Teddy mentioned?


579
00:32:56.829 --> 00:33:00.200
I heard lots of things
Teddy said and none made sense.


580
00:33:00.200 --> 00:33:02.436
Hold on, pal.
I was here, too.


581
00:33:02.436 --> 00:33:04.204
So was Miles.

582
00:33:04.204 --> 00:33:06.473
Look, we took his fingerprints.

583
00:33:06.473 --> 00:33:09.377
Look at that.
Tell me why it didn't have any.


584
00:33:09.377 --> 00:33:12.013
He didn't want any,
so he took them off with acid.


585
00:33:12.013 --> 00:33:13.781
Stop trying
to rationalize everything.


586
00:33:13.781 --> 00:33:15.616
We have a mystery on our hands.

587
00:33:15.616 --> 00:33:17.086
Sure. A real one.

588
00:33:17.086 --> 00:33:19.588
Whose body was it,
and where is it now?


589
00:33:19.588 --> 00:33:21.256
A completely normal mystery.

590
00:33:21.256 --> 00:33:24.093
Whatever it is, it's well within
the bounds of human experience.


591
00:33:24.093 --> 00:33:25.762
Don't blow things
out of proportion.


592
00:33:25.762 --> 00:33:28.131
I wouldn't if I hadn't
looked in Becky's cellar.


593
00:33:28.131 --> 00:33:29.966
How do you explain the body
I saw there?


594
00:33:29.966 --> 00:33:31.534
I don't think you saw one.

595
00:33:31.534 --> 00:33:32.869
And the body here?

596
00:33:32.869 --> 00:33:35.272
I know you saw it.
Three others saw it, too.


597
00:33:35.272 --> 00:33:37.007
But I dreamed up
the second one?


598
00:33:37.007 --> 00:33:39.110
Doctors can have
hallucinations, too.


599
00:33:39.110 --> 00:33:41.178
The mind is a strange
and wonderful thing.


600
00:33:41.178 --> 00:33:43.548
I'm not sure it'll ever be able
to figure itself out.


601
00:33:43.548 --> 00:33:46.118
Everything else, maybe--
from the atom to the universe--


602
00:33:46.118 --> 00:33:47.519
everything except itself.

603
00:33:47.519 --> 00:33:50.021
Nevertheless,
I saw Becky's double...


604
00:33:50.021 --> 00:33:51.457
and the body that we saw here...

605
00:33:51.457 --> 00:33:53.626
bore an uncomfortable
resemblance to Jack.


606
00:33:53.626 --> 00:33:55.294
Mighty uncomfortable.

607
00:33:55.294 --> 00:33:57.626
Let's go to Becky's
and have a look.


608
00:34:01.468 --> 00:34:03.971
Where's your
girlfriend's double?


609
00:34:03.971 --> 00:34:06.132
OK, skeptic,
lift the lid.


610
00:34:17.786 --> 00:34:19.221
There's a body here,
all right.


611
00:34:19.221 --> 00:34:20.923
-It's Becky's double.
-It sure is.


612
00:34:20.923 --> 00:34:22.254
Take another look.

613
00:34:25.929 --> 00:34:28.698
Now you see it,
now you don't.


614
00:34:28.698 --> 00:34:31.668
It was there--
half-hidden by that blanket.


615
00:34:31.668 --> 00:34:34.839
You said
you saw it there just now.


616
00:34:34.839 --> 00:34:36.007
I thought I did.

617
00:34:36.007 --> 00:34:37.909
Why did you come here
tonight?


618
00:34:37.909 --> 00:34:39.610
You'd seen a dead man
at Jack's...


619
00:34:39.610 --> 00:34:40.945
an average-sized man.

620
00:34:40.945 --> 00:34:43.115
The face in death
was smooth and unlined...


621
00:34:43.115 --> 00:34:45.684
bland in expression,
which often happens.


622
00:34:45.684 --> 00:34:47.119
You had just become aware...

623
00:34:47.119 --> 00:34:49.988
of a curious, unexplainable,
epidemic mass hysteria.


624
00:34:49.988 --> 00:34:53.126
Men, women, and children
suddenly convinced themselves...


625
00:34:53.126 --> 00:34:54.994
that their relatives weren't
their relatives at all...


626
00:34:54.994 --> 00:34:57.263
so your mind
started playing tricks...


627
00:34:57.263 --> 00:34:59.400
and reality became unreality.

628
00:34:59.400 --> 00:35:02.336
The dead man became
Jack's double in your eyes.


629
00:35:02.336 --> 00:35:03.504
Come off it, Dan.

630
00:35:03.504 --> 00:35:05.706
I know
it's all hard to believe...


631
00:35:05.706 --> 00:35:08.476
but these things happen--
even to witch doctors like me.


632
00:35:08.476 --> 00:35:11.246
I saw her here!
She was real!


633
00:35:11.246 --> 00:35:13.281
You saw her
in every tiny detail...


634
00:35:13.281 --> 00:35:15.650
as vividly as anyone
has ever seen anything...


635
00:35:15.650 --> 00:35:18.020
but only in your mind.

636
00:35:18.020 --> 00:35:20.921
Danny, talk all night,
but you're not convincing me.


637
00:35:22.925 --> 00:35:25.596
What are you doing in my cellar?

638
00:35:25.596 --> 00:35:28.599
Using it for an office.
These gentlemen are patients...


639
00:35:28.599 --> 00:35:30.897
badly in need
of psychiatric treatment.


640
00:35:32.169 --> 00:35:33.905
They've been having nightmares.

641
00:35:33.905 --> 00:35:35.206
If you're drunk,
you'd better sober up quick.


642
00:35:35.206 --> 00:35:36.441
The police are coming.

643
00:35:36.441 --> 00:35:37.775
No, we're not drunk.

644
00:35:37.775 --> 00:35:39.911
Nothing that simple.
Pull up a chair.


645
00:35:39.911 --> 00:35:41.446
Why, you're all crazy.

646
00:35:41.446 --> 00:35:43.882
What's going on down there?

647
00:35:43.882 --> 00:35:45.918
Hello, Nick.
Glad to see you.


648
00:35:45.918 --> 00:35:49.955
You saved these two characters
a trip to the station.


649
00:35:49.955 --> 00:35:53.693
They want to report
finding a body and losing it.


650
00:35:53.693 --> 00:35:55.462
Where? When?

651
00:35:55.462 --> 00:35:57.497
At my place about 7:00.

652
00:35:57.497 --> 00:36:00.101
Why did you
wait so long to report it?


653
00:36:00.101 --> 00:36:01.569
You know better than that, doc.

654
00:36:01.569 --> 00:36:05.139
It was a curious sort
of a body...


655
00:36:05.139 --> 00:36:08.510
and then it wasn't there
anymore.


656
00:36:08.510 --> 00:36:11.913
I have a good mind
to throw you both in jail.


657
00:36:11.913 --> 00:36:14.283
If you'd seen it,
you'd understand why we waited.


658
00:36:14.283 --> 00:36:17.453
Thin man...5'10"...

659
00:36:17.453 --> 00:36:19.322
fingerprints burned off
with acid?


660
00:36:19.322 --> 00:36:22.692
Just seen it on the slab
in the morgue.


661
00:36:22.692 --> 00:36:23.926
Turned up
in a burning haystack...


662
00:36:23.926 --> 00:36:27.431
on Mike Gessner's south pasture
two hours ago.


663
00:36:27.431 --> 00:36:29.833
Now break it up!

664
00:36:29.833 --> 00:36:31.425
Go on home!

665
00:36:38.610 --> 00:36:42.102
You win.
Pick up the marbles.


666
00:36:48.654 --> 00:36:49.822
Good morning.

667
00:36:49.822 --> 00:36:51.153
Good morning.

668
00:36:53.660 --> 00:36:55.996
Orange juice.

669
00:36:55.996 --> 00:36:57.864
Thank you.

670
00:36:57.864 --> 00:36:59.599
How do you
like your eggs?


671
00:36:59.599 --> 00:37:01.269
Any way you'd like.

672
00:37:01.269 --> 00:37:02.537
Boiled, two minutes?

673
00:37:02.537 --> 00:37:03.705
Two minutes?

674
00:37:03.705 --> 00:37:05.206
Mm-hmm.

675
00:37:05.206 --> 00:37:06.468
OK.

676
00:37:07.508 --> 00:37:09.078
You know...

677
00:37:09.078 --> 00:37:12.147
dragging you out of bed
last night was some trouble...


678
00:37:12.147 --> 00:37:13.482
but it was worth it.

679
00:37:13.482 --> 00:37:14.608
Seriously, Miles.

680
00:37:15.918 --> 00:37:17.580
What was that?

681
00:37:20.924 --> 00:37:22.084
Who is it?

682
00:37:23.660 --> 00:37:25.796
It's the gas man.

683
00:37:25.796 --> 00:37:27.024
Morning, doc.

684
00:37:28.799 --> 00:37:30.401
Good morning, Charlie.

685
00:37:30.401 --> 00:37:31.669
I guess I'm a little jittery.

686
00:37:31.669 --> 00:37:33.604
Not getting enough sleep.

687
00:37:33.604 --> 00:37:35.340
I won't bother you anymore.

688
00:37:35.340 --> 00:37:37.576
Putting a meter outside
on the patio.


689
00:37:37.576 --> 00:37:38.777
OK.

690
00:37:38.777 --> 00:37:41.113
The eggs will be hard-boiled.

691
00:37:41.113 --> 00:37:42.647
Did you do this
for your husband?


692
00:37:42.647 --> 00:37:43.816
Mm-hmm.

693
00:37:43.816 --> 00:37:45.518
Didn't your wife
do this for you?


694
00:37:45.518 --> 00:37:48.388
Yes. She liked to cook.

695
00:37:48.388 --> 00:37:50.556
That's one of the reasons
why I'm single--


696
00:37:50.556 --> 00:37:53.594
I never was there
when dinner was on the table.


697
00:37:53.594 --> 00:37:55.062
Take my advice...

698
00:37:55.062 --> 00:37:56.764
and don't get mixed up
with a doctor.


699
00:37:56.764 --> 00:37:58.132
They're seldom at home.

700
00:37:58.132 --> 00:38:00.135
What would you say
if I told you...


701
00:38:00.135 --> 00:38:02.637
I was already
mixed up with a doctor?


702
00:38:02.637 --> 00:38:05.073
I'd say it was too good
to be true.


703
00:38:05.073 --> 00:38:07.609
Things like this
can happen all of a sudden.


704
00:38:07.609 --> 00:38:09.044
What's "all of a sudden"
about two people...


705
00:38:09.044 --> 00:38:11.035
who've been friends
most of their lives?


706
00:38:12.248 --> 00:38:13.582
Good morning.

707
00:38:13.582 --> 00:38:15.184
Good morning.

708
00:38:15.184 --> 00:38:16.485
I thought
I smelled some coffee.


709
00:38:16.485 --> 00:38:17.654
Why didn't you give me a call?

710
00:38:17.654 --> 00:38:18.955
I didn't want to wake Teddy.

711
00:38:18.955 --> 00:38:21.691
She's wide-awake.
Got a good sleep.


712
00:38:21.691 --> 00:38:23.427
Good.

713
00:38:23.427 --> 00:38:26.330
But I don't feel
she should go home right away.


714
00:38:26.330 --> 00:38:29.600
Would you mind taking in
boarders for a while?


715
00:38:29.600 --> 00:38:32.937
Or do you have something else
in mind?


716
00:38:32.937 --> 00:38:35.607
I was toying with an idea...

717
00:38:35.607 --> 00:38:37.075
but you can stay.

718
00:38:37.075 --> 00:38:38.811
Here, Jack.

719
00:38:38.811 --> 00:38:40.938
Thank you, doll.
I'll take it to Teddy.


720
00:38:50.790 --> 00:38:53.093
Miles, did you make
that appointment for me...


721
00:38:53.093 --> 00:38:54.261
with the psychiatrist?

722
00:38:54.261 --> 00:38:55.763
Yes. 2:00.

723
00:38:55.763 --> 00:38:58.966
I don't need him.
I feel like such a fool.


724
00:38:58.966 --> 00:39:01.503
I woke up this morning,
and everything was all right.


725
00:39:01.503 --> 00:39:03.839
-You don't know my relief.
-Yes, I do.


726
00:39:03.839 --> 00:39:06.475
Will you call Becky
and tell her? She was worried.


727
00:39:06.475 --> 00:39:07.642
All right.

728
00:39:07.642 --> 00:39:09.145
She's at your house.

729
00:39:09.145 --> 00:39:10.680
At your house? Why?

730
00:39:10.680 --> 00:39:13.274
It's a long story,
but she'll tell you about it.


731
00:39:28.600 --> 00:39:30.761
Becky's still at his house.

732
00:39:34.606 --> 00:39:36.074
All right.

733
00:39:38.277 --> 00:39:39.645
Good morning.

734
00:39:39.645 --> 00:39:41.580
Good morning, Sally.

735
00:39:41.580 --> 00:39:44.049
Take a peek at what's
in the reception room.


736
00:39:48.021 --> 00:39:50.457
Mother,
why don't we go home?


737
00:39:50.457 --> 00:39:52.221
In a little while,
Jimmy.


738
00:39:55.630 --> 00:39:58.428
He certainly made
a quick recovery.


739
00:40:02.170 --> 00:40:04.072
I guess we all have.

740
00:40:04.072 --> 00:40:05.307
But driving home...

741
00:40:05.307 --> 00:40:07.643
I had a lot of questions
and no answers.


742
00:40:07.643 --> 00:40:10.613
How could Jimmy and Wilma
seem so normal now?


743
00:40:10.613 --> 00:40:12.549
Surely I had done nothing
to cure them.


744
00:40:12.549 --> 00:40:16.485
Maybe they wanted me
to feel secure, but why?


745
00:40:17.820 --> 00:40:18.989
Well...

746
00:40:18.989 --> 00:40:20.991
I hope
you didn't forget the steaks.


747
00:40:20.991 --> 00:40:22.493
I never forget anything.

748
00:40:22.493 --> 00:40:25.529
Don't worry about him.
He's completely housebroken.


749
00:40:25.529 --> 00:40:27.198
I need a martini, Beck.

750
00:40:27.198 --> 00:40:28.366
Onion or olive?

751
00:40:28.366 --> 00:40:30.669
Doesn't matter.
I want to pour it on the coals.


752
00:40:30.669 --> 00:40:31.870
They just won't burn.

753
00:40:31.870 --> 00:40:33.805
A martini isn't dry enough.

754
00:40:33.805 --> 00:40:36.008
I'll get you something
that'll start it.


755
00:40:36.008 --> 00:40:37.669
For drinking purposes.

756
00:40:39.278 --> 00:40:40.813
You're looking shipshape.

757
00:40:40.813 --> 00:40:42.371
Thank you, sir.

758
00:40:52.292 --> 00:40:53.624
Here we are.

759
00:41:16.286 --> 00:41:18.278
Jack! Jack!

760
00:41:22.793 --> 00:41:23.953
Ugh.

761
00:41:27.833 --> 00:41:30.165
They're like huge seedpods!

762
00:41:30.769 --> 00:41:33.761
This must be how that
body in my closet was formed.


763
00:41:35.608 --> 00:41:37.076
Where are they from?

764
00:41:37.076 --> 00:41:39.412
I don't know.
If they are seeds or seedpods...


765
00:41:39.412 --> 00:41:41.280
they must grow someplace
on a plant.


766
00:41:41.280 --> 00:41:44.118
And somebody or something wants
this duplication to take place.


767
00:41:44.118 --> 00:41:45.786
But when they're finished...

768
00:41:45.786 --> 00:41:46.954
what happens to our bodies?

769
00:41:46.954 --> 00:41:48.188
I don't know.

770
00:41:48.188 --> 00:41:50.357
When the process is complete,
probably the original...


771
00:41:50.357 --> 00:41:51.792
is destroyed or disintegrates...

772
00:41:51.792 --> 00:41:52.961
No! Wait!

773
00:41:52.961 --> 00:41:54.429
Sorry,
but I take a dim view...


774
00:41:54.429 --> 00:41:56.064
of watching my own destruction
take place.


775
00:41:56.064 --> 00:41:58.400
There isn't any danger
until they're completely formed.


776
00:41:58.400 --> 00:42:00.201
We learned that last night
at your house.


777
00:42:00.201 --> 00:42:02.204
Your blank
didn't change right away.


778
00:42:02.204 --> 00:42:04.229
Not until you fell asleep.

779
00:42:06.008 --> 00:42:09.011
Miles, when the change
does take place...


780
00:42:09.011 --> 00:42:11.048
do you suppose
there's any difference?


781
00:42:11.048 --> 00:42:12.315
There must be.

782
00:42:12.315 --> 00:42:15.152
Wilma noticed it.
So did little Jimmy.


783
00:42:15.152 --> 00:42:17.487
So did I.

784
00:42:17.487 --> 00:42:19.857
My father.

785
00:42:19.857 --> 00:42:22.460
That must be
what he was doing...


786
00:42:22.460 --> 00:42:25.263
in the cellar last night--
placing one of these.


787
00:42:25.263 --> 00:42:26.431
I'm sorry.

788
00:42:26.431 --> 00:42:28.500
I felt something wrong,
but I thought it was me...


789
00:42:28.500 --> 00:42:30.169
because I'd been away
for so long.


790
00:42:30.169 --> 00:42:32.504
They must be destroyed,
all of them!


791
00:42:32.504 --> 00:42:34.006
They will be--
every one of them.


792
00:42:34.006 --> 00:42:36.276
We're going to have
to search every building...


793
00:42:36.276 --> 00:42:37.544
every house in town.

794
00:42:37.544 --> 00:42:39.245
Men, women, and children
have to be examined.


795
00:42:39.245 --> 00:42:40.480
We've got some phoning to do.

796
00:42:40.480 --> 00:42:41.781
I'm going to stay
and watch them.


797
00:42:41.781 --> 00:42:42.949
I'm staying with you.

798
00:42:42.949 --> 00:42:44.184
Don't call the police!

799
00:42:44.184 --> 00:42:45.419
Nick Grivett
didn't find any body...


800
00:42:45.419 --> 00:42:46.977
on a burning haystack!

801
00:42:52.660 --> 00:42:54.563
Why don't you call
Danny? Maybe he can help.


802
00:42:54.563 --> 00:42:56.031
Danny?

803
00:42:56.031 --> 00:42:57.232
No.

804
00:42:57.232 --> 00:42:59.000
I'm afraid it's too late
to call Danny, too.


805
00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:00.469
What are you going to do?

806
00:43:00.469 --> 00:43:01.637
Get help.

807
00:43:01.637 --> 00:43:04.663
I hope whatever's taking place
is confined to Santa Mira!


808
00:43:12.549 --> 00:43:13.717
Operator.

809
00:43:13.717 --> 00:43:15.819
This is Dr. Bennell.
This is an emergency.


810
00:43:15.819 --> 00:43:18.990
I want to talk to the Federal
Bureau of Investigation in L.A.


811
00:43:18.990 --> 00:43:20.425
Can you convince them?

812
00:43:20.425 --> 00:43:21.760
I've got to.

813
00:43:21.760 --> 00:43:23.361
Where did they come from?

814
00:43:23.361 --> 00:43:26.164
So much has been
discovered these past few years.


815
00:43:26.164 --> 00:43:27.332
Anything is possible.

816
00:43:27.332 --> 00:43:29.168
Maybe the results
of atomic radiation...


817
00:43:29.168 --> 00:43:31.470
on plant life or animal life...

818
00:43:31.470 --> 00:43:35.007
some weird alien organism,
a mutation of some kind.


819
00:43:35.007 --> 00:43:37.711
Why should they take the form
of people--of us?


820
00:43:37.711 --> 00:43:39.846
I don't know.

821
00:43:39.846 --> 00:43:41.047
Whatever it is...

822
00:43:41.047 --> 00:43:42.849
whatever intelligence
or instinct it is...


823
00:43:42.849 --> 00:43:46.521
that can govern the forming
of human flesh and blood...


824
00:43:46.521 --> 00:43:48.389
out of thin air is...

825
00:43:48.389 --> 00:43:49.924
well,
it's fantastically powerful...


826
00:43:49.924 --> 00:43:52.093
beyond any comprehension,
malignant.


827
00:43:52.093 --> 00:43:53.328
All that body
in your cellar needed...


828
00:43:53.328 --> 00:43:55.697
was a mind, and it was...

829
00:43:55.697 --> 00:43:58.133
And it was taking mine
while I was asleep.


830
00:43:58.133 --> 00:44:00.235
I could take
that pitchfork myself, and--


831
00:44:00.235 --> 00:44:02.572
On your call
to Los Angeles, Doctor...


832
00:44:02.572 --> 00:44:04.140
they don't answer.

833
00:44:04.140 --> 00:44:06.709
Try again! That office
is open day and night!


834
00:44:06.709 --> 00:44:09.507
If they've taken over
the phone office, we're dead.


835
00:44:24.663 --> 00:44:26.654
Is that me?

836
00:44:56.932 --> 00:44:59.134
This is an emergency!
Emergency!


837
00:44:59.134 --> 00:45:01.193
Look, there's been-
-Hello?

838
00:45:02.739 --> 00:45:04.975
Operator,
get me a better connection.


839
00:45:04.975 --> 00:45:06.408
I'll try, Doctor.

840
00:45:07.944 --> 00:45:09.112
It's no use.

841
00:45:09.112 --> 00:45:11.115
All the Los Angeles circuits
are dead.


842
00:45:11.115 --> 00:45:14.018
OK, try Sacramento!
Give me the state capital.


843
00:45:14.018 --> 00:45:16.043
I want to talk to the governor.

844
00:45:17.889 --> 00:45:20.592
The Sacramento
circuits are busy, Doctor.


845
00:45:20.592 --> 00:45:22.150
I'll call you back.

846
00:45:24.029 --> 00:45:25.864
All right.

847
00:45:25.864 --> 00:45:27.354
All right.
I'll wait for your call.


848
00:45:31.237 --> 00:45:33.228
I'll take the phone outside.

849
00:45:36.877 --> 00:45:38.646
Jack, they've got the phone.

850
00:45:38.646 --> 00:45:41.615
You and the girls take your car
and make a run for it.


851
00:45:41.615 --> 00:45:43.517
First town you get to,
yell for help.


852
00:45:43.517 --> 00:45:44.718
What about you?

853
00:45:44.718 --> 00:45:46.121
That phone
is gonna ring soon.


854
00:45:46.121 --> 00:45:48.590
If nobody answers,
they'll block the roads.


855
00:45:48.590 --> 00:45:49.758
I'll stall them.

856
00:45:49.758 --> 00:45:51.026
Then what?

857
00:45:51.026 --> 00:45:52.427
Try and find out
what's in back of this.


858
00:45:52.427 --> 00:45:54.063
-I'm staying.
-No!


859
00:45:54.063 --> 00:45:55.894
Miles,
don't ask me to leave you.


860
00:45:57.700 --> 00:45:58.868
Jack, get going.

861
00:45:58.868 --> 00:46:00.436
Miles, I can't--

862
00:46:00.436 --> 00:46:01.938
Somebody's got to go,
or we don't get help!


863
00:46:01.938 --> 00:46:03.573
Please,
let's get out of here!


864
00:46:03.573 --> 00:46:05.302
Watch out for yourselves.

865
00:46:07.210 --> 00:46:09.613
Go over by the phone.
Stay there.


866
00:46:09.613 --> 00:46:10.910
If it rings, call me.

867
00:46:50.459 --> 00:46:51.660
Hello.

868
00:46:51.660 --> 00:46:53.095
Is Dr. Bennell there?

869
00:46:53.095 --> 00:46:55.331
-Yes. I'll get him.
-Never mind.


870
00:46:55.331 --> 00:46:57.633
Just tell him the Sacramento
circuits are still busy...


871
00:46:57.633 --> 00:46:59.302
and ask him if he wants me
to keep trying.


872
00:46:59.302 --> 00:47:00.670
All right. Hold on.

873
00:47:00.670 --> 00:47:02.773
Miles,
the circuits are still busy!


874
00:47:02.773 --> 00:47:04.141
Tell her to keep trying!

875
00:47:04.141 --> 00:47:06.302
Also, try San Francisco
and Washington!


876
00:47:12.617 --> 00:47:14.119
We're getting
out of here right now.


877
00:47:14.119 --> 00:47:15.353
Where are we going?

878
00:47:15.353 --> 00:47:16.513
Sally's!

879
00:47:19.057 --> 00:47:21.027
We're still unable
to get through to Los Angeles.


880
00:47:21.027 --> 00:47:23.396
Do you wish me to keep trying?

881
00:47:23.396 --> 00:47:24.624
Dr. Bennell?

882
00:47:25.865 --> 00:47:27.533
Dr. Bennell?

883
00:47:27.533 --> 00:47:29.336
I needed
someone I could trust...


884
00:47:29.336 --> 00:47:32.472
and I figured Sally, my nurse,
was my best bet.


885
00:47:32.472 --> 00:47:35.642
I decided to try to phone her
to see if she was at home.


886
00:47:35.642 --> 00:47:37.645
Maybe they hadn't
taken over the pay phones.


887
00:47:37.645 --> 00:47:39.914
I'll try the pay phone.

888
00:47:39.914 --> 00:47:41.916
Hey, Mac!

889
00:47:41.916 --> 00:47:43.684
Oh, hi, doc.
How are you?


890
00:47:43.684 --> 00:47:46.355
Will you get me
a couple gallons fast?


891
00:47:46.355 --> 00:47:48.524
Sure.
Martha, doc's in a hurry!


892
00:47:48.524 --> 00:47:49.889
Get the windshield, will you?

893
00:47:53.095 --> 00:47:56.088
I have to have the keys
to open the gas tank.


894
00:47:58.368 --> 00:48:00.837
Somebody sick out this way?

895
00:48:00.837 --> 00:48:02.672
There's been an accident.

896
00:48:02.672 --> 00:48:04.809
Funny.
We haven't heard about it.


897
00:48:04.809 --> 00:48:06.444
It just happened.

898
00:48:06.444 --> 00:48:08.879
Before I could
even get her number...


899
00:48:08.879 --> 00:48:10.981
I saw Mac closing
the trunk of my car.


900
00:48:10.981 --> 00:48:12.284
He could have been
checking my spare tire...


901
00:48:12.284 --> 00:48:13.919
but I didn't think so.

902
00:48:13.919 --> 00:48:15.087
That should do it.

903
00:48:15.087 --> 00:48:16.288
Thank you.

904
00:48:16.288 --> 00:48:17.489
All set?

905
00:48:17.489 --> 00:48:19.024
-All set, doc.
-Fine. Thanks.


906
00:48:19.024 --> 00:48:21.516
-Put it on my bill, will you?
-Sure, doc.


907
00:48:41.149 --> 00:48:43.049
What's the matter?

908
00:49:09.013 --> 00:49:11.413
We've got to make it
to Sally's house.


909
00:49:21.227 --> 00:49:24.097
I wasn't sure
I could trust anyone...


910
00:49:24.097 --> 00:49:26.588
but I took a chance
and drove to Sally's anyway.


911
00:49:32.773 --> 00:49:35.476
When I saw several cars
in front of the house...


912
00:49:35.476 --> 00:49:37.034
I decided to play it safe.

913
00:49:42.951 --> 00:49:44.252
What's wrong?

914
00:49:44.252 --> 00:49:46.254
Probably nothing,
but we're not going in there...


915
00:49:46.254 --> 00:49:47.490
until I'm sure it's safe.

916
00:49:47.490 --> 00:49:49.659
Slide under the wheel
and get out of here fast...


917
00:49:49.659 --> 00:49:51.991
if anybody shows up
looking for us.


918
00:50:19.158 --> 00:50:20.860
The baby asleep yet, Sally?

919
00:50:20.860 --> 00:50:22.796
Not yet,
but she will be soon...


920
00:50:22.796 --> 00:50:24.998
and there'll be no more tears.

921
00:50:24.998 --> 00:50:26.833
Shall I put this in her room?

922
00:50:26.833 --> 00:50:28.501
Yes. In her playpen.

923
00:50:28.501 --> 00:50:31.739
No, wait.
Maybe I'd better take it.


924
00:50:31.739 --> 00:50:33.140
Why don't you go in, Miles?

925
00:50:33.140 --> 00:50:34.835
We've been waiting for you.

926
00:50:41.383 --> 00:50:43.585
Becky, start the car!
Quick!


927
00:50:43.585 --> 00:50:45.314
Becky, get going!

928
00:50:55.499 --> 00:50:57.768
Attention, all units...

929
00:50:57.768 --> 00:51:00.671
attention, all units--
apprehend and detain...


930
00:51:00.671 --> 00:51:03.574
Dr. Miles Bennell
and Becky Driscoll...


931
00:51:03.574 --> 00:51:04.943
now believed heading north...

932
00:51:04.943 --> 00:51:06.911
in a black and white
Ford sedan...


933
00:51:06.911 --> 00:51:12.017
license number 2
-X-3-7-7-9-6.

934
00:51:12.017 --> 00:51:14.153
All units designated
as roadblocks...


935
00:51:14.153 --> 00:51:15.688
move to your stations.

936
00:51:15.688 --> 00:51:16.889
It is urgent.

937
00:51:16.889 --> 00:51:18.691
These two persons
must be detained...


938
00:51:18.691 --> 00:51:20.926
and not permitted
to leave Santa Mira.


939
00:51:20.926 --> 00:51:23.088
Repeat--it is urgent...

940
00:51:25.966 --> 00:51:30.705
Be on the lookout for a 1 955
black and white Ford sedan...


941
00:51:30.705 --> 00:51:35.165
license number 2
-X-3-7-7-9-6.

942
00:52:10.415 --> 00:52:12.952
We'll try to make it
to my office.


943
00:52:12.952 --> 00:52:14.442
Cut into that alley
on the right.


944
00:53:45.655 --> 00:53:48.325
Do you think he'll come back?

945
00:53:48.325 --> 00:53:51.361
I don't think they'll
check again before morning.


946
00:53:51.361 --> 00:53:54.455
By then, Jack should be here
with help.


947
00:54:00.004 --> 00:54:02.841
What if
Jack doesn't get through?


948
00:54:02.841 --> 00:54:04.409
He's gotta get through.

949
00:54:04.409 --> 00:54:06.278
Here. Take two of these.

950
00:54:06.278 --> 00:54:08.269
They'll help you to stay awake.

951
00:54:25.833 --> 00:54:28.336
We can't close our eyes
all night.


952
00:54:28.336 --> 00:54:29.928
We may wake up changed...

953
00:54:31.373 --> 00:54:33.500
into something evil and inhuman.

954
00:54:35.244 --> 00:54:36.945
In my practice,
I've seen how people...


955
00:54:36.945 --> 00:54:39.616
have allowed their humanity
to drain away.


956
00:54:39.616 --> 00:54:43.353
Only, it happens slowly
instead of all at once.


957
00:54:43.353 --> 00:54:45.221
They didn't seem to mind.

958
00:54:45.221 --> 00:54:47.290
But just some people.

959
00:54:47.290 --> 00:54:49.793
All of us--a little bit.

960
00:54:49.793 --> 00:54:53.364
We harden our hearts
and grow callous.


961
00:54:53.364 --> 00:54:55.332
Only when we have to fight
to stay human...


962
00:54:55.332 --> 00:54:59.004
do we realize how precious
it is to us...


963
00:54:59.004 --> 00:55:00.335
how dear...

964
00:55:02.874 --> 00:55:04.432
as you are to me.

965
00:55:14.955 --> 00:55:17.257
Maybe that's Jack
trying to find us.


966
00:55:17.257 --> 00:55:19.521
He'd know better
than to use the phone.


967
00:55:21.261 --> 00:55:22.388
Where is he?

968
00:55:23.631 --> 00:55:24.893
Why doesn't he come?

969
00:55:35.911 --> 00:55:37.503
Just like any Saturday morning.

970
00:55:40.183 --> 00:55:42.786
Len Pearlman, Bill Bittner...

971
00:55:42.786 --> 00:55:46.489
Jim Clark and his wife Shirley
and their kids...


972
00:55:46.489 --> 00:55:48.259
people I've known all my life.

973
00:55:48.259 --> 00:55:49.453
What time is it?

974
00:55:51.629 --> 00:55:54.498
Seven forty-five.

975
00:55:54.498 --> 00:55:56.534
Yeah, I know.

976
00:55:56.534 --> 00:55:57.836
It's too early to be so busy.

977
00:55:57.836 --> 00:56:00.906
What are they doing here?

978
00:56:00.906 --> 00:56:02.908
There's the answer.

979
00:56:02.908 --> 00:56:05.478
There must be strangers in town.

980
00:56:05.478 --> 00:56:08.448
They're waiting for the bus
to come and go.


981
00:56:08.448 --> 00:56:11.110
There isn't another one
through here until 1 1 :00.


982
00:57:05.545 --> 00:57:07.604
Farmers.

983
00:57:08.848 --> 00:57:12.085
Grimaldi, Pixley...

984
00:57:12.085 --> 00:57:13.420
Gessner!

985
00:57:13.420 --> 00:57:14.922
Crescent City.

986
00:57:14.922 --> 00:57:18.959
If you have Crescent City
families, step to truck one.


987
00:57:18.959 --> 00:57:21.028
Crescent City...

988
00:57:21.028 --> 00:57:23.031
the first truck.

989
00:57:23.031 --> 00:57:24.533
Redbank.

990
00:57:24.533 --> 00:57:27.536
All with Redbank families
or contacts...


991
00:57:27.536 --> 00:57:29.604
go to truck number two.

992
00:57:29.604 --> 00:57:32.642
All with Redbank families
or contacts...


993
00:57:32.642 --> 00:57:34.043
truck number two.

994
00:57:34.043 --> 00:57:35.878
Havenhurst...

995
00:57:35.878 --> 00:57:37.547
the third truck.

996
00:57:37.547 --> 00:57:39.716
Havenhurst--
the third truck.


997
00:57:39.716 --> 00:57:42.352
Mill Town--the third truck.

998
00:57:42.352 --> 00:57:45.556
Mill Town--the third truck.

999
00:57:45.556 --> 00:57:47.558
Valley Springs...

1000
00:57:47.558 --> 00:57:49.060
the third truck.

1001
00:57:49.060 --> 00:57:50.795
Valley Springs...

1002
00:57:50.795 --> 00:57:52.297
First our town...

1003
00:57:52.297 --> 00:57:55.300
then all the towns around us.

1004
00:57:55.300 --> 00:57:56.801
It's a malignant disease...

1005
00:57:56.801 --> 00:57:58.804
spreading through
the whole country.


1006
00:57:58.804 --> 00:58:00.639
That's all for today.

1007
00:58:00.639 --> 00:58:03.073
Be ready again tomorrow.

1008
00:58:16.557 --> 00:58:19.527
I can't wait for Jack
any longer. Stay here.


1009
00:58:19.527 --> 00:58:20.695
You're not going out there?

1010
00:58:20.695 --> 00:58:22.263
I've got to stop them!

1011
00:58:22.263 --> 00:58:23.925
Wait! We're safe here!

1012
00:58:28.337 --> 00:58:30.272
They're not here.
I hope we're not too late.


1013
00:58:30.272 --> 00:58:31.706
Jack! Thank God!

1014
00:58:33.143 --> 00:58:35.445
The whole town's been
taken over by the pods!


1015
00:58:35.445 --> 00:58:38.948
Not quite.
There's still you and Becky.


1016
00:58:38.948 --> 00:58:40.951
Miles, it would have
been so much easier...


1017
00:58:40.951 --> 00:58:42.386
if you'd gone to sleep
last night.


1018
00:58:42.386 --> 00:58:45.219
Relax.
We're here to help you.


1019
00:58:46.891 --> 00:58:48.960
You know better than that.

1020
00:58:48.960 --> 00:58:50.462
Where do you want us
to put them?


1021
00:58:50.462 --> 00:58:51.830
Would you like
to watch them grow?


1022
00:58:51.830 --> 00:58:54.199
-No, thanks.
-Put them in there.


1023
00:58:54.199 --> 00:58:57.402
There's nothing to be afraid of.
We're not going to hurt you.


1024
00:58:57.402 --> 00:58:59.272
Once you understand,
you'll be grateful.


1025
00:58:59.272 --> 00:59:01.607
Remember how Teddy and I
fought against it.


1026
00:59:01.607 --> 00:59:02.909
We were wrong.

1027
00:59:02.909 --> 00:59:04.410
You mean Teddy doesn't mind?

1028
00:59:04.410 --> 00:59:06.914
Of course not.
She feels exactly the way I do.


1029
00:59:06.914 --> 00:59:08.415
Let us go!

1030
00:59:08.415 --> 00:59:09.650
If we leave town,
we won't come back.


1031
00:59:09.650 --> 00:59:13.187
We can't let you go.
You're dangerous to us.


1032
00:59:13.187 --> 00:59:14.789
Don't fight it, Miles.
It's no use.


1033
00:59:14.789 --> 00:59:18.259
Sooner or later,
you'll have to go to sleep.


1034
00:59:18.259 --> 00:59:20.895
I'll wait for you in the hall.

1035
00:59:20.895 --> 00:59:24.066
Miles,
you and I are scientific men.


1036
00:59:24.066 --> 00:59:26.235
You can understand the wonder
of what's happened.


1037
00:59:26.235 --> 00:59:29.038
Just think.
Less than a month ago...


1038
00:59:29.038 --> 00:59:30.906
Santa Mira
was like any other town--


1039
00:59:30.906 --> 00:59:32.342
people with nothing
but problems.


1040
00:59:32.342 --> 00:59:35.345
Then out of the sky
came a solution.


1041
00:59:35.345 --> 00:59:38.348
Seeds drifting through space
for years...


1042
00:59:38.348 --> 00:59:40.350
took root in a farmer's field.

1043
00:59:40.350 --> 00:59:42.353
From the seeds came pods...

1044
00:59:42.353 --> 00:59:44.755
which had the power
to reproduce themselves...


1045
00:59:44.755 --> 00:59:48.492
in the exact likeness
of any form of life.


1046
00:59:48.492 --> 00:59:50.996
So that's how it began...

1047
00:59:50.996 --> 00:59:52.930
out of the sky.

1048
00:59:54.766 --> 00:59:57.770
Your new bodies
are growing in there.


1049
00:59:57.770 --> 01:00:00.773
They're taking you over
cell for cell...


1050
01:00:00.773 --> 01:00:02.275
atom for atom.

1051
01:00:02.275 --> 01:00:03.776
There's no pain.

1052
01:00:03.776 --> 01:00:05.511
Suddenly, while you're asleep...

1053
01:00:05.511 --> 01:00:08.949
they'll absorb your minds,
your memories...


1054
01:00:08.949 --> 01:00:12.519
and you're reborn
into an untroubled world.


1055
01:00:12.519 --> 01:00:15.023
Where everyone's the same?

1056
01:00:15.023 --> 01:00:17.025
Exactly.

1057
01:00:17.025 --> 01:00:18.994
What a world.

1058
01:00:18.994 --> 01:00:22.030
We're not the last humans left.

1059
01:00:22.030 --> 01:00:23.933
They'll destroy you!

1060
01:00:23.933 --> 01:00:27.003
Tomorrow,
you won't want them to.


1061
01:00:27.003 --> 01:00:28.493
Tomorrow, you'll be one of us.

1062
01:00:33.143 --> 01:00:34.645
I love Becky.

1063
01:00:34.645 --> 01:00:37.080
Tomorrow, will I feel the same?

1064
01:00:37.080 --> 01:00:39.750
There's no need for love.

1065
01:00:39.750 --> 01:00:41.653
No emotion?

1066
01:00:41.653 --> 01:00:45.990
Then you have no feelings,
only the instinct to survive.


1067
01:00:45.990 --> 01:00:48.793
You can't love or be loved!
Am I right?


1068
01:00:48.793 --> 01:00:50.396
You say it
as if it were terrible.


1069
01:00:50.396 --> 01:00:53.098
Believe me, it isn't.
You've been in love before.


1070
01:00:53.098 --> 01:00:56.602
It didn't last.
It never does.


1071
01:00:56.602 --> 01:01:00.173
Love, desire, ambition, faith--

1072
01:01:00.173 --> 01:01:03.276
without them, life's so simple,
believe me.


1073
01:01:03.276 --> 01:01:06.212
I don't want any part of it.

1074
01:01:06.212 --> 01:01:08.115
You're forgetting
something, Miles.


1075
01:01:08.115 --> 01:01:09.283
What's that?

1076
01:01:09.283 --> 01:01:11.547
You have no choice.

1077
01:01:16.124 --> 01:01:18.593
I guess we haven't any choice.

1078
01:01:18.593 --> 01:01:19.787
Good.

1079
01:01:29.405 --> 01:01:31.999
I want to love and be loved!

1080
01:01:34.812 --> 01:01:36.380
I want your children.

1081
01:01:36.380 --> 01:01:39.383
I don't want a world
without love or grief or beauty.


1082
01:01:39.383 --> 01:01:41.653
I'd rather die.

1083
01:01:41.653 --> 01:01:43.154
No.

1084
01:01:43.154 --> 01:01:44.348
No.

1085
01:01:47.025 --> 01:01:50.029
Not unless there's no other way.

1086
01:01:50.029 --> 01:01:51.664
Why didn't they
give us a shot...


1087
01:01:51.664 --> 01:01:54.166
or a sleeping pill or something?

1088
01:01:54.166 --> 01:01:57.658
Drugs dull the mind.
Maybe that's the reason.


1089
01:02:06.279 --> 01:02:08.783
No. It wouldn't work.

1090
01:02:08.783 --> 01:02:11.686
I might get one or even two,
but I couldn't get three.


1091
01:02:11.686 --> 01:02:13.354
You're forgetting something,
darling--me.


1092
01:02:13.354 --> 01:02:14.555
It isn't three against one.

1093
01:02:14.555 --> 01:02:16.751
It's three against two.
Give me a knife.


1094
01:02:18.127 --> 01:02:19.617
No.

1095
01:03:25.669 --> 01:03:26.829
There.

1096
01:03:35.680 --> 01:03:36.942
Go by the desk.

1097
01:03:56.936 --> 01:03:58.939
What's going on in there?

1098
01:03:58.939 --> 01:04:01.609
Miles!
Unlock the door!


1099
01:04:01.609 --> 01:04:03.344
Miles, open the door!

1100
01:04:03.344 --> 01:04:05.012
Open the door, Miles!

1101
01:04:05.012 --> 01:04:06.673
JACK,   Aah!

1102
01:04:09.251 --> 01:04:10.411
Open the door!

1103
01:04:23.132 --> 01:04:25.260
Oh! Aah!

1104
01:04:26.637 --> 01:04:27.831
Oh!

1105
01:04:36.214 --> 01:04:38.614
Our only hope is
to make it to the highway.


1106
01:04:51.665 --> 01:04:53.166
That does it.

1107
01:04:53.166 --> 01:04:55.936
The only other way
is out the front door...


1108
01:04:55.936 --> 01:04:57.604
and there's bound
to be somebody watching.


1109
01:04:57.604 --> 01:04:59.163
We'll have to chance it.

1110
01:05:13.121 --> 01:05:16.124
Keep your eyes
a little wide and blank.


1111
01:05:16.124 --> 01:05:17.615
Show no interest or excitement.

1112
01:05:41.653 --> 01:05:45.157
Well, Sam,
we're finally with you.


1113
01:05:45.157 --> 01:05:46.392
They were supposed
to let me know.


1114
01:05:46.392 --> 01:05:49.028
The chief said he'd phone
the station, then call me.


1115
01:05:49.028 --> 01:05:51.665
He phoned,
but the line was busy.


1116
01:05:51.665 --> 01:05:53.599
He's calling again now.

1117
01:05:54.935 --> 01:05:56.436
Aah!

1118
01:05:56.436 --> 01:05:57.903
Watch out!

1119
01:06:00.675 --> 01:06:02.404
I'm sorry, Miles.

1120
01:06:54.068 --> 01:06:55.602
This is Janzek.
They got away.


1121
01:06:55.602 --> 01:06:56.830
Turn the main siren on.

1122
01:07:06.881 --> 01:07:08.645
Hey! Stairs!

1123
01:07:28.139 --> 01:07:30.164
It's only a few steps more.

1124
01:07:43.656 --> 01:07:45.453
Come on!
They went this way!


1125
01:08:07.249 --> 01:08:09.684
They're over there!

1126
01:09:35.748 --> 01:09:37.850
Miles, I can't.

1127
01:09:37.850 --> 01:09:39.852
I can't go on.

1128
01:09:39.852 --> 01:09:41.683
Yes, you can.

1129
01:10:38.585 --> 01:10:40.712
Here's her sweater!
They must be in the tunnel!


1130
01:10:50.698 --> 01:10:53.532
Look, Tommy,
you go that way!


1131
01:11:00.041 --> 01:11:03.045
Give up!
You can't get away from us!


1132
01:11:03.045 --> 01:11:06.742
We're not going to hurt you!
Give up!


1133
01:11:17.361 --> 01:11:18.930
They're not in the tunnel.

1134
01:11:18.930 --> 01:11:21.165
All right, everybody, outside.
Come on.


1135
01:11:21.165 --> 01:11:23.656
Let's check the hills.
Everybody, move.


1136
01:11:30.175 --> 01:11:34.612
Miles,
I can't stay awake much longer.


1137
01:11:36.316 --> 01:11:39.052
I think they're all gone now.

1138
01:11:39.052 --> 01:11:42.419
We'd better start, or we'll
never make it to the highway.


1139
01:12:40.620 --> 01:12:44.091
Miles, I've never heard
anything so beautiful.


1140
01:12:44.091 --> 01:12:45.460
It means we're not
the only ones left...


1141
01:12:45.460 --> 01:12:47.595
to know what love is.

1142
01:12:47.595 --> 01:12:50.798
Stay here, and pray
they're as human as they sound.


1143
01:12:50.798 --> 01:12:52.163
Bye, darling.

1144
01:13:46.661 --> 01:13:50.665
This is station KCAA,
the 24-hour platter parade...


1145
01:13:50.665 --> 01:13:51.962
the station of music--

1146
01:14:22.601 --> 01:14:23.761
Becky.

1147
01:14:26.104 --> 01:14:27.332
Becky!

1148
01:14:32.078 --> 01:14:33.238
Becky?

1149
01:14:35.315 --> 01:14:37.117
Becky, where are you?!

1150
01:14:37.117 --> 01:14:38.812
I'm here, Miles.

1151
01:14:41.622 --> 01:14:43.624
You didn't go to sleep?

1152
01:14:43.624 --> 01:14:45.126
I'm so tired.

1153
01:14:45.126 --> 01:14:48.363
They weren't people.
It was more of them.


1154
01:14:48.363 --> 01:14:50.065
They're growing thousands
of pods in greenhouses.


1155
01:14:50.065 --> 01:14:51.967
We've got to get away.

1156
01:14:51.967 --> 01:14:54.036
I'm exhausted, Miles.

1157
01:14:54.036 --> 01:14:56.027
I can't make it.

1158
01:15:12.490 --> 01:15:15.152
We can't make it
without sleep.


1159
01:15:16.995 --> 01:15:18.986
Yes, we can.

1160
01:15:35.515 --> 01:15:39.520
I went to sleep,
Miles, and it happened.


1161
01:15:39.520 --> 01:15:41.317
Oh, Becky.

1162
01:15:43.157 --> 01:15:44.492
They were right.

1163
01:15:44.492 --> 01:15:46.495
I should never have left you.

1164
01:15:46.495 --> 01:15:49.191
Stop acting like a fool,
Miles, and accept us.


1165
01:15:51.066 --> 01:15:52.363
No.

1166
01:15:53.736 --> 01:15:55.171
Never!

1167
01:15:55.171 --> 01:15:56.773
He's in here!

1168
01:15:56.773 --> 01:15:58.808
He's in here!

1169
01:15:58.808 --> 01:16:00.935
Get him! Get him!

1170
01:16:09.186 --> 01:16:12.090
I've been afraid
a lot of times in my life...


1171
01:16:12.090 --> 01:16:13.992
but I didn't know
the real meaning of fear...


1172
01:16:13.992 --> 01:16:18.063
until I had kissed Becky.

1173
01:16:18.063 --> 01:16:20.499
A moment's sleep,
and the girl I loved...


1174
01:16:20.499 --> 01:16:23.235
was an inhuman enemy
bent on my destruction.


1175
01:16:23.235 --> 01:16:25.705
That moment's sleep
was death to Becky's soul...


1176
01:16:25.705 --> 01:16:27.440
just as it had been
for Jack and Teddy...


1177
01:16:27.440 --> 01:16:29.309
and Dan Kauffman
and all the rest.


1178
01:16:29.309 --> 01:16:30.877
Their bodies were now hosts...

1179
01:16:30.877 --> 01:16:34.314
harboring an alien form
of life, a cosmic form...


1180
01:16:34.314 --> 01:16:37.018
which, to survive,
must take over every human man.


1181
01:16:37.018 --> 01:16:38.820
So I ran, I ran...

1182
01:16:38.820 --> 01:16:41.289
I ran as little Jimmy
had run the other day.


1183
01:16:41.289 --> 01:16:43.458
My only hope was to get away
from Santa Mira...


1184
01:16:43.458 --> 01:16:44.726
to get to the highway...

1185
01:16:44.726 --> 01:16:46.991
to warn the others
of what was happening.


1186
01:17:01.811 --> 01:17:03.647
Wait!

1187
01:17:03.647 --> 01:17:06.150
Let him go!
They'll never believe him.


1188
01:17:06.150 --> 01:17:07.685
Help! Help!

1189
01:17:07.685 --> 01:17:08.986
Wait!

1190
01:17:08.986 --> 01:17:11.319
Help! Help! Wait!

1191
01:17:12.524 --> 01:17:16.361
Wait! Stop!
Stop and listen to me!


1192
01:17:16.361 --> 01:17:17.863
Listen to me!

1193
01:17:17.863 --> 01:17:21.868
Those people that are coming
after me! They're not human!


1194
01:17:21.868 --> 01:17:23.803
Listen to me!
We're in danger!


1195
01:17:23.803 --> 01:17:25.671
Get out of here!

1196
01:17:25.671 --> 01:17:28.174
You're in danger! Please!

1197
01:17:28.174 --> 01:17:29.810
Get out of here!
Go on!


1198
01:17:29.810 --> 01:17:31.278
Get moving!

1199
01:17:31.278 --> 01:17:33.280
They're after all of us!

1200
01:17:33.280 --> 01:17:34.681
All of us!

1201
01:17:34.681 --> 01:17:36.383
Listen to me!

1202
01:17:36.383 --> 01:17:39.649
There isn't a human being
left in Santa Mira!


1203
01:17:40.922 --> 01:17:42.690
Stop!

1204
01:17:42.690 --> 01:17:45.193
Pull over! I need your help!

1205
01:17:45.193 --> 01:17:46.695
Something terrible's happened!

1206
01:17:46.695 --> 01:17:48.230
You're drunk!
Get out of the street!


1207
01:17:48.230 --> 01:17:50.221
Get out of here! Go on!

1208
01:18:02.212 --> 01:18:04.749
Are you crazy,
you big idiot?


1209
01:18:04.749 --> 01:18:08.219
Look!
You fools! You're in danger!


1210
01:18:08.219 --> 01:18:10.721
Can't you see?
They're after you!


1211
01:18:10.721 --> 01:18:12.658
They're after all of us!

1212
01:18:12.658 --> 01:18:14.726
Our wives, our children,
everyone!


1213
01:18:14.726 --> 01:18:16.862
They're here already!

1214
01:18:16.862 --> 01:18:18.697
You're next!

1215
01:18:18.697 --> 01:18:20.366
You're next!

1216
01:18:20.366 --> 01:18:21.868
You're next!

1217
01:18:21.868 --> 01:18:23.369
You're next!

1218
01:18:23.369 --> 01:18:24.859
You're next!

1219
01:18:32.880 --> 01:18:35.983
You don't believe
a word of this, do you?


1220
01:18:35.983 --> 01:18:37.619
Sure, it's fantastic,
but it happened.


1221
01:18:37.619 --> 01:18:39.721
Don't just sit there
measuring me for a straitjacket!


1222
01:18:39.721 --> 01:18:42.212
Do something! Get on the phone!
Call for help!


1223
01:18:43.825 --> 01:18:46.192
What's the use?

1224
01:19:01.812 --> 01:19:04.782
What do you think?
Will psychiatry help?


1225
01:19:04.782 --> 01:19:07.552
If all this
is a nightmare, yes.


1226
01:19:07.552 --> 01:19:08.887
Of course it's a nightmare.

1227
01:19:08.887 --> 01:19:11.891
Plants from another world
taking over human beings.


1228
01:19:11.891 --> 01:19:13.483
Mad as a March hare.

1229
01:19:16.662 --> 01:19:18.564
What have we here?

1230
01:19:18.564 --> 01:19:20.299
He ran his truck
through a red light.


1231
01:19:20.299 --> 01:19:22.202
Greyhound bus
smacked him broadside...


1232
01:19:22.202 --> 01:19:23.470
and tipped him over.

1233
01:19:23.470 --> 01:19:24.871
Put him in the O.R.

1234
01:19:24.871 --> 01:19:26.673
Will you take over Bennell
for me?


1235
01:19:26.673 --> 01:19:27.941
Certainly.

1236
01:19:27.941 --> 01:19:29.377
How badly is he hurt?

1237
01:19:29.377 --> 01:19:31.902
Both legs, left arm,
broken all to bits.


1238
01:19:32.980 --> 01:19:34.615
We had to dig him out...

1239
01:19:34.615 --> 01:19:38.253
from under the most
peculiar things I ever saw.


1240
01:19:38.253 --> 01:19:39.588
What things?

1241
01:19:39.588 --> 01:19:40.756
I don't know what they are.

1242
01:19:40.756 --> 01:19:42.391
I never saw them before.

1243
01:19:42.391 --> 01:19:45.360
They looked like, uh,
great big seedpods.


1244
01:19:45.360 --> 01:19:47.697
Seedpods?

1245
01:19:47.697 --> 01:19:49.232
Where was the truck
coming from?


1246
01:19:49.232 --> 01:19:50.563
Santa Mira.

1247
01:19:55.906 --> 01:19:59.243
Get on your radio
and sound an all-points alarm.


1248
01:19:59.243 --> 01:20:01.111
Block all highways
and stop all traffic...


1249
01:20:01.111 --> 01:20:03.603
and call every law enforcement
agency in the state.


1250
01:20:05.417 --> 01:20:08.420
Operator, get me the Federal
Bureau of Investigation.


1251
01:20:08.420 --> 01:20:09.751
Yes, it's an emergency!
