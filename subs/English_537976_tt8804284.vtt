1
00:00:47.831 --> 00:00:50.573
First time I saw it was
at Harvard Business School.


2
00:00:57.667 --> 00:00:59.756
It just blew me away.

3
00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.890
When he goes out to that runway

4
00:01:03.977 --> 00:01:05.762
and then you see
the bombers coming in.


5
00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:13.770
I think it's got a lot
of good life lessons in it.


6
00:01:17.252 --> 00:01:22.387
It sets up very clearly this
kind of two types of leadership.


7
00:01:22.474 --> 00:01:25.216
One being the touchy-feely guy

8
00:01:25.303 --> 00:01:29.960
and Gregory Peck,
who is clearly a hard-ass.


9
00:01:31.266 --> 00:01:32.745
But he's not a hard-ass.

10
00:01:33.833 --> 00:01:34.921
Smoke, Ernie?

11
00:01:35.008 --> 00:01:37.402
Thank you, sir.

12
00:01:37.489 --> 00:01:41.711
Think about the scene where
he's coming to take command.


13
00:01:41.798 --> 00:01:44.540
The staff car pulls up
to the gate,


14
00:01:44.627 --> 00:01:46.716
and he's riding shotgun
with the driver.


15
00:01:46.803 --> 00:01:48.457
And I think he even calls him
by his first name.


16
00:01:48.544 --> 00:01:50.198
He gets out,
he smokes a cigarette,


17
00:01:50.285 --> 00:01:51.721
he gives a cigarette
to the sergeant,


18
00:01:51.808 --> 00:01:53.940
then he throws
the cigarette away,


19
00:01:54.027 --> 00:01:55.551
gets in the back seat
of the staff car,


20
00:01:55.638 --> 00:01:56.769
and he's a general.

21
00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:58.902
All right, Sergeant.

22
00:02:02.732 --> 00:02:04.908
He understands his dharma.

23
00:02:04.995 --> 00:02:07.954
He understands
what he has to do.


24
00:02:08.041 --> 00:02:11.393
He understands that for
the betterment of those guys,


25
00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:15.092
for them to fulfill their task,
he has to do it.


26
00:02:20.837 --> 00:02:21.838
Attention!

27
00:02:24.536 --> 00:02:29.628
Dharma is the combination
of duty, fate, and destiny.


28
00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:35.460
For me to fulfill my dharma,
I have to fulfill my duty.


29
00:02:37.201 --> 00:02:38.637
Rest.

30
00:02:38.724 --> 00:02:40.596
I've been sent down here

31
00:02:40.683 --> 00:02:44.121
to take over what has come to
be known as "a hard-luck group."


32
00:02:44.208 --> 00:02:46.036
Well, I don't believe
in hard luck.


33
00:02:46.123 --> 00:02:48.952
So we're going to find out
what the trouble is.


34
00:02:49.039 --> 00:02:52.782
We're going back
to fundamentals.


35
00:02:52.869 --> 00:02:54.958
And I can tell you now,
one reason


36
00:02:55.045 --> 00:02:56.960
I think you've
been having hard luck--


37
00:02:58.353 --> 00:03:00.485
I saw it in your faces
last night.


38
00:03:01.443 --> 00:03:03.706
I can see it there now.

39
00:03:03.793 --> 00:03:06.665
You've been looking
at a lot of air lately.


40
00:03:06.752 --> 00:03:09.277
You think you ought
to have a rest.


41
00:03:09.364 --> 00:03:12.323
In short,
you're sorry for yourselves.


42
00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:14.369
Now I don't have
a lot of patience with this,


43
00:03:14.456 --> 00:03:15.631
"What are we
fighting for?" stuff.


44
00:03:15.718 --> 00:03:17.807
We're in a war,
a shooting war.


45
00:03:17.894 --> 00:03:18.938
We've got to fight.

46
00:03:19.025 --> 00:03:21.289
And some of us have got to die.

47
00:03:21.376 --> 00:03:24.335
I'm not trying to tell you
not to be afraid.


48
00:03:24.422 --> 00:03:26.250
Fear is normal.

49
00:03:26.337 --> 00:03:30.167
But stop worrying about it--
and about yourselves.


50
00:03:30.254 --> 00:03:33.823
Stop making plans.
Forget about going home.


51
00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:35.390
Consider yourselves
already dead.


52
00:03:37.392 --> 00:03:39.263
Attention!

53
00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:42.092
I think it's
a very simple film


54
00:03:42.179 --> 00:03:44.834
with a very simple
powerful message that...


55
00:03:44.921 --> 00:03:48.011
modernity is based
around emotionalism,


56
00:03:48.098 --> 00:03:51.057
what you think is
helping everybody,


57
00:03:51.144 --> 00:03:53.712
but in fact is not allowing
them to fulfill their destiny,


58
00:03:53.799 --> 00:03:55.148
to fulfill their fate.

59
00:03:55.236 --> 00:03:58.021
Even though that fate
and that destiny


60
00:03:58.108 --> 00:04:00.110
may be their own
personal destruction.


61
00:04:06.595 --> 00:04:10.338
A lot of your ideas
are about tearing things down,


62
00:04:10.425 --> 00:04:12.688
war, and destruction.

63
00:04:16.779 --> 00:04:21.697
I believe that you need some
fairly radical restructuring


64
00:04:21.784 --> 00:04:25.440
of this,
and rethinking of this.


65
00:04:25.527 --> 00:04:28.965
The permanent political class
that controls our country


66
00:04:29.052 --> 00:04:31.881
is going to stay
exactly like it is,


67
00:04:31.968 --> 00:04:34.275
until you have true disruption.

68
00:04:37.843 --> 00:04:39.976
It can't be a pillow fight.

69
00:04:41.804 --> 00:04:43.458
You need some killers.

70
00:04:43.545 --> 00:04:45.764
You get some killers,
you're going to see some change


71
00:04:45.851 --> 00:04:47.244
We all know
what the problems are.


72
00:04:47.331 --> 00:04:48.985
"Do you have
the guts to do it?"


73
00:04:49.072 --> 00:04:50.900
Trump had it,
and that's why


74
00:04:50.987 --> 00:04:52.728
he's President
of the United States.


75
00:05:05.436 --> 00:05:07.395
Can I bring up
one last thing?


76
00:05:07.482 --> 00:05:09.571
just Twelve O'Clock High,
one thing I thought of is that


77
00:05:09.658 --> 00:05:13.270
in the motivation of the men

78
00:05:13.357 --> 00:05:16.926
to focus on the mission,
and not themselves,


79
00:05:17.013 --> 00:05:20.582
he was prepared
to not be loved,


80
00:05:20.669 --> 00:05:22.758
in fact to be hated.

81
00:05:22.845 --> 00:05:26.152
If you want to effect change
the important thing is to--


82
00:05:26.239 --> 00:05:28.285
Effect change, yeah.

83
00:05:28.372 --> 00:05:29.939
I used to tell the guys
at Breitbart,


84
00:05:30.026 --> 00:05:33.682
Napoleon's saying
to his Marshals of France,


85
00:05:33.769 --> 00:05:37.163
"When you set out to
take Vienna, take Vienna."


86
00:05:47.086 --> 00:05:50.960
I had gone to Telluride
on and off for years.


87
00:05:51.047 --> 00:05:53.310
I don't even think
I knew at time


88
00:05:53.397 --> 00:05:54.877
that you were going
to have an interview


89
00:05:54.964 --> 00:05:56.444
with McNamara afterwards.

90
00:05:56.531 --> 00:05:58.663
I was just there
to see the film.


91
00:06:00.535 --> 00:06:02.798
I wanted to at least
start to produce these myself,


92
00:06:02.885 --> 00:06:04.713
and start to make films
like this.


93
00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:07.977
Seeing "The Fog of War" at
Telluride was the inspiration.


94
00:06:08.064 --> 00:06:09.674
It's all of you to blame.

95
00:06:09.761 --> 00:06:11.720
Yeah, why not?

96
00:06:18.901 --> 00:06:20.511
If you go back
to Twelve O'Clock High,


97
00:06:20.598 --> 00:06:24.472
to this Quonset hut
where those pilots were,


98
00:06:24.559 --> 00:06:26.169
that's kind of
the populist side.


99
00:06:28.780 --> 00:06:30.913
The working men of America.

100
00:06:33.437 --> 00:06:35.265
But then you see your film
and you understand


101
00:06:35.352 --> 00:06:37.485
the precision daylight bombing
and flying in a fortress


102
00:06:37.572 --> 00:06:39.269
and all that...

103
00:06:39.356 --> 00:06:42.272
was conceived and thought of
by guys like McNamara.


104
00:06:47.190 --> 00:06:50.585
What worked against Germany
and Imperial Japan


105
00:06:50.672 --> 00:06:53.239
clearly was
the exact wrong thing


106
00:06:53.326 --> 00:06:55.067
for how you fight a war
against people


107
00:06:55.154 --> 00:06:57.287
trying to get their independence
and their freedom.


108
00:06:58.767 --> 00:07:00.508
You can see in McNamara

109
00:07:00.595 --> 00:07:02.553
the personification
of globalization.


110
00:07:05.034 --> 00:07:09.125
It's that scientific,
engineering, managerial elite,


111
00:07:09.212 --> 00:07:11.867
that everything's
a set of math to them.


112
00:07:11.954 --> 00:07:14.217
This is all out
of Harvard Business School.


113
00:07:14.304 --> 00:07:16.567
It's all out of
Harvard Business School.


114
00:07:16.654 --> 00:07:19.396
They had this concept, I think
it's become a radical concept,


115
00:07:19.483 --> 00:07:22.268
about the maximization
of shareholder value--


116
00:07:22.355 --> 00:07:24.270
the whole beginning
of the shipping of jobs.


117
00:07:24.357 --> 00:07:26.447
Everything could have
a mathematical base to it,


118
00:07:26.534 --> 00:07:29.798
or have a logical,
or a reason base to it.


119
00:07:29.885 --> 00:07:32.235
I look at The Fog of
Waras a very despairing film,


120
00:07:32.322 --> 00:07:34.063
where McNamara
very near the end, says,


121
00:07:34.150 --> 00:07:37.414
"Rationality will not save us."

122
00:07:37.501 --> 00:07:39.285
I took it a different way.

123
00:07:39.372 --> 00:07:41.113
It's a Greek tragedy, I took it
as hopeful, and here's why:


124
00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:44.334
What's hopeful
about Greek tragedy?


125
00:07:44.421 --> 00:07:47.337
Because you learn
the lessons of it, right?


126
00:07:47.424 --> 00:07:52.995
His rationality can't save us,
didn't save us,


127
00:07:53.082 --> 00:07:56.346
actually buried us into Vietnam
much, much deeper.


128
00:08:01.830 --> 00:08:03.788
What makes us omniscient?

129
00:08:06.661 --> 00:08:08.793
Have we a record of omniscience?

130
00:08:12.536 --> 00:08:15.365
We are the strongest nation
in the world today.


131
00:08:17.672 --> 00:08:19.630
I do not believe
we should ever


132
00:08:19.717 --> 00:08:22.328
apply that economic, political,
or military power unilaterally.


133
00:08:26.550 --> 00:08:29.118
If we had followed
that rule in Vietnam,


134
00:08:29.205 --> 00:08:30.946
we wouldn't have been there.

135
00:08:51.444 --> 00:08:52.881
We were a hardcore
Democratic family.


136
00:08:56.972 --> 00:08:59.409
I went to a Catholic
military prep school.


137
00:09:01.063 --> 00:09:03.065
Vietnam tore
that community apart.


138
00:09:05.284 --> 00:09:08.026
We had a football coach,
Mr. Monaghan.


139
00:09:10.942 --> 00:09:13.379
His boy got killed in Vietnam.

140
00:09:13.466 --> 00:09:15.860
Some of these families,
they never recovered from that.


141
00:09:15.947 --> 00:09:17.296
I'm a paperboy at the time,

142
00:09:17.383 --> 00:09:18.994
and delivering
the papers every day


143
00:09:19.081 --> 00:09:20.996
and you see 200,000 troops
and 250,000 troops,


144
00:09:21.083 --> 00:09:23.172
and 300,000 troops,

145
00:09:23.259 --> 00:09:25.566
and you're a patriot
so you still believe in it,


146
00:09:25.653 --> 00:09:27.524
but you see
the families destroyed.


147
00:09:27.611 --> 00:09:29.700
So I'm at West Point.

148
00:09:29.787 --> 00:09:33.269
My daughter's sophomore year,
it's 2008, I think it is.


149
00:09:38.100 --> 00:09:39.667
It's a tough story to tell.

150
00:09:39.754 --> 00:09:41.190
The West Point girls'
volleyball team


151
00:09:41.277 --> 00:09:43.845
was going to get new uniforms,

152
00:09:43.932 --> 00:09:46.238
and they bring the uniforms in
in boxes off to the side,


153
00:09:46.325 --> 00:09:50.460
and the girls are practicin' in
this huge old dirigible hangar,


154
00:09:50.547 --> 00:09:53.376
where the volleyball team
plays-- from the 1920s.


155
00:09:53.463 --> 00:09:54.943
Looking at this, and looking
at the West Point girls,


156
00:09:55.030 --> 00:09:56.771
and I look over at the boxes.

157
00:09:56.858 --> 00:09:57.946
I just kind of go over
and look at the new uniforms.


158
00:09:58.033 --> 00:09:59.687
They're sealed.

159
00:09:59.774 --> 00:10:01.384
"Made in Vietnam."

160
00:10:03.342 --> 00:10:04.605
"Made in Vietnam."

161
00:10:06.650 --> 00:10:08.260
I lost it.

162
00:10:10.654 --> 00:10:13.135
"Made in Vietnam."

163
00:10:13.222 --> 00:10:15.703
Fifty thousand dead, you know,

164
00:10:15.790 --> 00:10:18.488
a hundred thousand wounded,
families torn apart,


165
00:10:18.575 --> 00:10:19.837
the whole of Southeast Asia,
what,


166
00:10:19.924 --> 00:10:21.883
10, 20, 30
million people murdered?


167
00:10:21.970 --> 00:10:23.580
Right?

168
00:10:23.667 --> 00:10:25.582
What was it all for?

169
00:10:25.669 --> 00:10:29.499
What was Monaghan's kid,
what was that for?


170
00:10:30.500 --> 00:10:32.502
"Made in Vietnam."

171
00:10:37.812 --> 00:10:41.424
With all the jobs
lost to globalization.


172
00:10:41.511 --> 00:10:44.993
It was an incredibly
clarifying moment for me.


173
00:11:03.228 --> 00:11:05.796
In the 20th century,
we decided,


174
00:11:05.883 --> 00:11:08.930
that these individual nation-
states at war with each other


175
00:11:09.017 --> 00:11:10.758
would produce disaster,

176
00:11:10.845 --> 00:11:14.500
and that some solution
had to be contrived.


177
00:11:14.587 --> 00:11:18.287
And when you say we,
what do you mean, "we"?


178
00:11:18.374 --> 00:11:20.158
We didn't decide that at all.

179
00:11:20.245 --> 00:11:21.769
I completely and totally
disagree with that.


180
00:11:21.856 --> 00:11:23.553
-I know you do.
-No, but--


181
00:11:23.640 --> 00:11:27.644
It wasn't the common man
that got us into World War I,


182
00:11:27.731 --> 00:11:29.646
and in World War II,
and in Vietnam,


183
00:11:29.733 --> 00:11:31.996
and all the other wars
that have been fought.


184
00:11:32.083 --> 00:11:36.305
It's Monaghan's son
that's always the recipient
of all the crap.


185
00:11:36.392 --> 00:11:37.872
When you say,
these "nation states,"


186
00:11:37.959 --> 00:11:39.874
it's the elites that
got us into that mess,


187
00:11:39.961 --> 00:11:44.487
and then they came up with some
sort of supranational apparatus


188
00:11:44.574 --> 00:11:46.054
that's gonna take care of it.

189
00:11:46.141 --> 00:11:47.708
No, no, no, no, no.
I disagree 100 percent.


190
00:11:47.795 --> 00:11:50.711
They are the ones
that drove the destruction


191
00:11:50.798 --> 00:11:52.190
of the 20th century.

192
00:11:54.802 --> 00:11:57.152
The reason I'm a populist,

193
00:11:57.239 --> 00:11:59.720
I've gone to
the elite institutions.


194
00:12:01.852 --> 00:12:03.898
I was in the United States Navy
as an officer,


195
00:12:05.900 --> 00:12:08.163
went to
Harvard Business School,


196
00:12:08.250 --> 00:12:11.819
went to Georgetown and got
a Master's in Foreign Affairs,


197
00:12:11.906 --> 00:12:13.995
was in all the board rooms,

198
00:12:14.082 --> 00:12:15.518
went to Hollywood...

199
00:12:19.348 --> 00:12:22.177
and here's the one thing
I can tell you:


200
00:12:22.264 --> 00:12:24.092
If you gave me the choice

201
00:12:24.179 --> 00:12:27.051
between being governed

202
00:12:27.138 --> 00:12:31.839
by the first 100 people
that show up in red ball caps


203
00:12:31.926 --> 00:12:34.842
at a Trump rally...

204
00:12:34.929 --> 00:12:38.062
versus the first hundred guys
that walk into Davos


205
00:12:38.149 --> 00:12:40.282
with their tickets,

206
00:12:40.369 --> 00:12:43.198
I'll take
the working class people,


207
00:12:43.285 --> 00:12:46.854
because they have more humanity
and they understand the world,


208
00:12:46.941 --> 00:12:48.812
and they understand and
have grit and determination,


209
00:12:48.899 --> 00:12:50.727
and they've had to deal...

210
00:12:50.814 --> 00:12:52.598
with all the world
dumps on them.


211
00:12:52.685 --> 00:12:54.862
But what good
does it do to throw


212
00:12:54.949 --> 00:12:57.734
all of the DACA people
out of America?


213
00:12:57.821 --> 00:13:00.476
What good does it do to allow

214
00:13:00.563 --> 00:13:04.045
corporations to pollute
the environment?


215
00:13:04.132 --> 00:13:06.308
Is this populism?

216
00:13:07.875 --> 00:13:10.965
Or is this
something much uglier?


217
00:13:12.183 --> 00:13:13.968
Uglier being what?

218
00:13:14.055 --> 00:13:16.971
Serving big business
and the rich.


219
00:13:20.844 --> 00:13:22.803
It's anti-populism.

220
00:13:25.501 --> 00:13:27.155
That's what bothers me.

221
00:13:27.242 --> 00:13:29.766
That's what makes me
think you're crazy.


222
00:13:30.985 --> 00:13:32.769
And why?

223
00:13:32.856 --> 00:13:36.294
Why? Because I think there's
an inherent contradiction


224
00:13:36.381 --> 00:13:38.470
in the views that you hold?

225
00:13:41.517 --> 00:13:44.302
Do you just want
to destroy everything?


226
00:13:55.357 --> 00:13:56.924
You may hate my guts,

227
00:13:57.011 --> 00:14:00.275
and you may hate
what I stand for,


228
00:14:00.362 --> 00:14:04.366
but if we don't allow
some way for the system


229
00:14:04.453 --> 00:14:07.673
to spread the wealth,

230
00:14:07.760 --> 00:14:09.806
we're going to have
a revolution in this country.


231
00:14:14.202 --> 00:14:15.986
It is coming...

232
00:14:17.031 --> 00:14:18.859
as night follows day.

233
00:14:44.928 --> 00:14:47.713
Do movies provide
an alternative reality,


234
00:14:47.800 --> 00:14:52.327
something that is more powerful
than the real world?


235
00:14:52.414 --> 00:14:56.244
In the Reagan film, I take
a lot of time in talking about


236
00:14:56.331 --> 00:14:58.507
how our idealized version
of America


237
00:14:58.594 --> 00:15:00.770
was done by those
great filmmakers


238
00:15:00.857 --> 00:15:03.381
in the '20s and '30s,
'40s and '50s.


239
00:15:03.468 --> 00:15:07.603
"When the legend becomes more
powerful, print the legend."


240
00:15:07.690 --> 00:15:11.172
Do you think maybe there's a
chance we still might find her?


241
00:15:11.259 --> 00:15:16.525
Injun will chase a thing 'til
he thinks he's chased it enough.


242
00:15:16.612 --> 00:15:20.877
Then he quits.
Same way when he runs.


243
00:15:20.964 --> 00:15:23.358
Seems like he never learns
there's such a thing


244
00:15:23.445 --> 00:15:26.448
as a critter who'll
just keep coming on.


245
00:15:28.276 --> 00:15:31.714
So we'll find them in the end,
I promise you.


246
00:15:31.801 --> 00:15:36.806
We'll find them, just as sure
as the turning of the Earth.


247
00:15:38.721 --> 00:15:42.029
Who do you see yourself as
in these movies?


248
00:15:42.116 --> 00:15:45.032
Gregory Peck? John Wayne?

249
00:15:45.119 --> 00:15:46.555
I've never actually
sat there and go,


250
00:15:46.642 --> 00:15:48.383
"Oh, I'm the Gregory Peck
character."


251
00:15:48.470 --> 00:15:50.994
But clearly in the films
that I love


252
00:15:51.081 --> 00:15:52.778
and I watch
over and over again,


253
00:15:52.865 --> 00:15:56.826
there's a certain type
of individual.


254
00:15:56.913 --> 00:16:00.264
Remember, the John Wayne
character in The Searchers


255
00:16:00.351 --> 00:16:03.006
is kind of an outcast.

256
00:16:06.836 --> 00:16:09.621
It's hard to believe
they're white.


257
00:16:09.708 --> 00:16:12.581
They ain't white... anymore.

258
00:16:12.668 --> 00:16:15.410
They're Comanch...

259
00:16:15.497 --> 00:16:17.107
Where are your casualties?

260
00:16:22.330 --> 00:16:25.289
I'm clearly drawn
to those characters,


261
00:16:25.376 --> 00:16:27.335
and the way
they comport themselves--


262
00:16:27.422 --> 00:16:29.250
also the way
they never give up.


263
00:16:29.337 --> 00:16:32.818
You know, the honey badger
nature of, "just don't quit."


264
00:16:32.905 --> 00:16:37.040
That famous video, he doesn't
care and he doesn't quit.


265
00:16:37.127 --> 00:16:38.824
He's got all these
terrible habits.


266
00:16:41.566 --> 00:16:43.438
He's relentless.
He will not give up.


267
00:16:43.525 --> 00:16:44.874
And I think the thing went out

268
00:16:44.961 --> 00:16:46.528
and had, like,
a hundred million views.


269
00:16:46.615 --> 00:16:48.269
We used to watch it
at Breitbart.


270
00:16:48.356 --> 00:16:50.532
"Honey badger
doesn't give a shit, right?


271
00:16:50.619 --> 00:16:52.012
because he doesn't give a shit.

272
00:16:52.099 --> 00:16:53.274
You just gotta do
what you gotta do.


273
00:16:53.361 --> 00:16:55.363
We didn't care

274
00:16:55.450 --> 00:16:57.452
if we played by the rules,

275
00:16:57.539 --> 00:16:59.845
or particularly against
the Republican establishment


276
00:16:59.932 --> 00:17:02.979
that was so straitlaced
at the time.


277
00:17:03.066 --> 00:17:04.285
When did you realize
that you could


278
00:17:04.372 --> 00:17:06.026
turn it into politics?

279
00:17:08.289 --> 00:17:10.030
Was there an epiphany?

280
00:17:11.205 --> 00:17:13.076
Was it at Breitbart?

281
00:17:13.163 --> 00:17:16.036
2008, the financial crisis
in the fall,


282
00:17:16.123 --> 00:17:18.081
and then President Obama
coming in in January,


283
00:17:18.168 --> 00:17:19.517
and the reaction to that,

284
00:17:19.604 --> 00:17:20.649
the bailouts and
everything like that.


285
00:17:20.736 --> 00:17:22.216
I saw in the Tea Party

286
00:17:22.303 --> 00:17:25.045
really what would become
this populist movement.


287
00:17:25.132 --> 00:17:28.048
It would need a platform
that could get its stories out,


288
00:17:28.135 --> 00:17:31.660
and in Breitbart and Andrew,
you had a real firebrand,


289
00:17:31.747 --> 00:17:34.315
a firebrand who knew culture.

290
00:17:34.402 --> 00:17:36.056
One of his themes
was that culture


291
00:17:36.143 --> 00:17:37.666
is upriver from politics.

292
00:17:40.190 --> 00:17:42.105
Just like in
Twelve O'Clock High,


293
00:17:42.192 --> 00:17:45.195
he'd made it
a central part of our mission.


294
00:17:49.808 --> 00:17:52.420
Anthony Weiner at that time
was as much a cultural figure


295
00:17:52.507 --> 00:17:54.509
as a political figure.

296
00:17:54.596 --> 00:17:57.773
One of the most promising young
politicians in the country.


297
00:17:57.860 --> 00:17:59.644
They were talking about
Anthony Weiner as being


298
00:17:59.731 --> 00:18:01.864
a legitimate candidate for
President of the United States.


299
00:18:01.951 --> 00:18:04.171
We see it in the United States
Senate every single day,


300
00:18:04.258 --> 00:18:06.695
where members say, "We want
amendments. We want debate.


301
00:18:06.782 --> 00:18:08.740
We want amendments,
but we're still a no."


302
00:18:08.827 --> 00:18:10.481
And then we stand up and say,

303
00:18:10.568 --> 00:18:12.527
"Oh, if only we had a different
process, we'd vote yes."


304
00:18:12.614 --> 00:18:14.920
You vote yes if you believe yes.

305
00:18:15.007 --> 00:18:16.357
You vote in favor of something
if you believe


306
00:18:16.444 --> 00:18:18.141
it's the right thing.

307
00:18:18.228 --> 00:18:19.708
If you believe it's
the wrong thing, you vote no.


308
00:18:19.795 --> 00:18:21.710
We are following a procedure.

309
00:18:21.797 --> 00:18:23.581
I will not yield
to the gentleman,


310
00:18:23.668 --> 00:18:25.888
and the gentleman
will observe regular order.


311
00:18:25.975 --> 00:18:28.369
The gentleman will
observe regular order.


312
00:18:28.456 --> 00:18:30.632
I was down in Richmond
with my dad


313
00:18:30.719 --> 00:18:32.155
at eleven o'clock
on a Friday night,


314
00:18:32.242 --> 00:18:33.504
watching the Nightly News,

315
00:18:33.591 --> 00:18:34.984
and we get a phone call,
you know,


316
00:18:35.071 --> 00:18:36.986
can we get on the bridge line?

317
00:18:37.073 --> 00:18:39.771
Right away? There's something
that's happened with Weiner.


318
00:18:41.556 --> 00:18:44.428
He's at home watching
the Washington Capitals game


319
00:18:44.515 --> 00:18:46.126
and he tweets out--

320
00:18:49.868 --> 00:18:52.088
He had thought
he was direct messaging her,


321
00:18:52.175 --> 00:18:53.698
but he had hit
the wrong thing on Twitter,


322
00:18:53.785 --> 00:18:55.483
and put it out
on his entire Twitter feed.


323
00:18:55.570 --> 00:18:57.659
But only up for a nanosecond.

324
00:18:59.487 --> 00:19:01.097
He took it down immediately.

325
00:19:03.012 --> 00:19:04.448
In fact, nobody
ever asked later,


326
00:19:04.535 --> 00:19:06.189
how did we actually
capture that?


327
00:19:06.276 --> 00:19:07.451
Because you just couldn't
possibly capture it...


328
00:19:07.538 --> 00:19:09.497
unless you had somebody,

329
00:19:09.584 --> 00:19:11.412
basically on watch,
and they did.


330
00:19:11.499 --> 00:19:13.762
Some people approached Andrew

331
00:19:13.849 --> 00:19:15.633
that were kind of volunteers
and were following this,


332
00:19:15.720 --> 00:19:17.244
really put him
on 24-hour watch.


333
00:19:18.941 --> 00:19:21.683
Andrew immediately
went out publicly.


334
00:19:24.860 --> 00:19:28.516
It got to be a firestorm, but
Weiner immediately came back


335
00:19:28.603 --> 00:19:30.082
and said, "I'd been hacked."

336
00:19:33.390 --> 00:19:35.131
This would be
the deathblow for the company.


337
00:19:35.218 --> 00:19:36.698
If we had gone out and done this

338
00:19:36.785 --> 00:19:38.482
and actually made it up
or it was not true,


339
00:19:38.569 --> 00:19:40.049
Breitbart's over.

340
00:19:40.136 --> 00:19:42.443
It was I think on
that Monday or Tuesday


341
00:19:42.530 --> 00:19:45.010
that other people
started coming forward.


342
00:19:45.097 --> 00:19:48.797
In fact, someone approached us,
a guy had approached us


343
00:19:48.884 --> 00:19:50.842
with the pictures...

344
00:19:50.929 --> 00:19:52.148
There was a classic
Andrew Breitbart,


345
00:19:52.235 --> 00:19:54.498
drop one, let him respond.

346
00:19:56.892 --> 00:19:58.546
Drop the other,
let him deny it.


347
00:20:02.289 --> 00:20:05.161
We got down to
the fourth picture,


348
00:20:05.248 --> 00:20:07.859
the money shot so to say.

349
00:20:07.946 --> 00:20:11.689
-The dick pic.
-His johnson, right.


350
00:20:12.908 --> 00:20:16.303
He basically called surrender.

351
00:20:16.390 --> 00:20:18.653
Andrew was in the hotel right
next door, complete coincidence.


352
00:20:18.740 --> 00:20:22.004
Weiner's backstage,
I think, or what I heard,


353
00:20:22.091 --> 00:20:24.833
trying to talk his wife into
coming up on stage with him.


354
00:20:24.920 --> 00:20:26.574
Andrew comes in the back.

355
00:20:26.661 --> 00:20:29.098
All the national media
turns to Andrew Breitbart.


356
00:20:31.927 --> 00:20:35.496
They're asking him questions,
the guys have their microphones,


357
00:20:35.583 --> 00:20:39.587
"Hey, we can't hear
your answer. Go up on stage."


358
00:20:41.937 --> 00:20:43.330
And Andrew Breitbart walks up.

359
00:20:46.115 --> 00:20:48.509
I'm here coincidentally,
I just arrived at LaGuardia


360
00:20:48.596 --> 00:20:49.727
because of media requests.

361
00:20:49.814 --> 00:20:52.121
And as I got into my hotel...

362
00:20:53.818 --> 00:20:56.038
I'm Andrew Breitbart,
by the way.


363
00:20:56.125 --> 00:20:58.780
It is news, my friend,
it is news.


364
00:20:58.867 --> 00:21:02.436
And I know of countless other
websites and news organizations


365
00:21:02.523 --> 00:21:04.264
that would put this out there.

366
00:21:04.351 --> 00:21:06.048
If you wrote a script
and pitched that in Hollywood,


367
00:21:06.135 --> 00:21:07.702
they would laugh you
out of the room.


368
00:21:07.789 --> 00:21:09.704
I mean, here you're
watching on national TV


369
00:21:09.791 --> 00:21:11.706
and Andrew Breitbart walks up

370
00:21:11.793 --> 00:21:14.230
to the Anthony Weiner
press conference


371
00:21:14.317 --> 00:21:16.711
with global media there--
and literally takes it over


372
00:21:16.798 --> 00:21:18.669
and has a command performance.

373
00:21:18.756 --> 00:21:21.716
And you would have no way of
knowing where this would lead.


374
00:21:21.803 --> 00:21:25.328
No, if you said at the time
that, in 2016,


375
00:21:25.415 --> 00:21:28.070
in the final two months
that Anthony Weiner,


376
00:21:28.157 --> 00:21:31.073
Huma Abedin,
the Breitbart operation,


377
00:21:31.160 --> 00:21:34.250
the guy that followed Andrew
after he died...


378
00:21:34.337 --> 00:21:36.383
It's like I said,
if you wrote that script,


379
00:21:36.470 --> 00:21:37.558
people would throw you
out of the room.


380
00:21:37.645 --> 00:21:38.602
It would be ridiculous.

381
00:21:48.830 --> 00:21:50.353
I really didn't
know Trump.


382
00:21:50.440 --> 00:21:52.268
He knew me as
the head of Breitbart.


383
00:21:57.578 --> 00:21:59.754
The Mercers just went
to Trump, and said,


384
00:21:59.841 --> 00:22:01.799
"You're going to lose
by 15 or 20 points..


385
00:22:01.886 --> 00:22:04.280
if he kept going down this path.

386
00:22:11.679 --> 00:22:14.116
After I had met with him, I went
to the campaign headquarters


387
00:22:14.203 --> 00:22:15.204
for the first time...

388
00:22:17.424 --> 00:22:19.643
'Cause I'd never been
in a campaign headquarters
in my life!


389
00:22:22.080 --> 00:22:25.432
So I get there at like,

390
00:22:25.519 --> 00:22:27.172
the 14th floor.

391
00:22:27.259 --> 00:22:29.044
And so I expected young
people to be walking around


392
00:22:29.131 --> 00:22:31.829
with polling data,
and all these smart guys


393
00:22:31.916 --> 00:22:34.615
looking at targets of
where we're going to go to.


394
00:22:34.702 --> 00:22:37.313
I'm thinking I'm going
to walk into some Robert Redford


395
00:22:37.400 --> 00:22:38.619
The Candidatemovie.

396
00:22:43.711 --> 00:22:45.190
When I get up there,
it's totally dark.


397
00:22:48.063 --> 00:22:50.457
Nobody there.
It's like, it's 7:00 at night.


398
00:22:50.544 --> 00:22:53.634
And there's one guy. And
I said, "Where is everybody?"


399
00:22:53.721 --> 00:22:55.375
And he goes,
"Well, it's Sunday."


400
00:22:55.462 --> 00:22:57.333
And I go, "Yeah, I got that,
but where are they?"


401
00:22:57.420 --> 00:22:58.639
And he says, "Well, they'll
all be back tomorrow.


402
00:22:58.726 --> 00:23:01.729
They don't really
work weekends."


403
00:23:01.816 --> 00:23:05.733
When I take over he's somewhere
between 12 and 16 points down,


404
00:23:05.820 --> 00:23:07.561
double digits down in most
of the battleground states.


405
00:23:10.738 --> 00:23:12.653
Hillary Clinton's really
not even campaigning anymore,


406
00:23:12.740 --> 00:23:14.829
just raising money.

407
00:23:14.916 --> 00:23:17.005
Then when I'm announced,
it's like the Trump campaign's


408
00:23:17.092 --> 00:23:18.485
so out of business--

409
00:23:18.572 --> 00:23:19.703
This is just Trump
getting vengeance


410
00:23:19.790 --> 00:23:22.184
by getting this mad bomber

411
00:23:22.271 --> 00:23:25.927
who's just going to wreak
vengeance on all his enemies.


412
00:23:26.014 --> 00:23:28.016
-The mad bomber being you.
-Yes.


413
00:23:28.103 --> 00:23:29.757
And it's the exact opposite.
All we did is said,


414
00:23:29.844 --> 00:23:31.846
"Hey, we've got
to be maniacally focused.


415
00:23:31.933 --> 00:23:33.282
Simplify everything."

416
00:23:33.369 --> 00:23:35.502
Make her the spokesman
and the guardian


417
00:23:35.589 --> 00:23:38.026
of a corrupt and
incompetent status quo--


418
00:23:38.113 --> 00:23:39.549
an elite--

419
00:23:39.636 --> 00:23:40.942
and you make Trump
the agent of change


420
00:23:41.029 --> 00:23:42.291
that President Obama wasn't.

421
00:23:49.298 --> 00:23:51.692
We could see his message
was resonating,


422
00:23:51.779 --> 00:23:54.216
and all you had to do was
channel that in the right way.


423
00:23:55.522 --> 00:23:59.569
And yes,
we will build a wall.


424
00:24:03.138 --> 00:24:04.748
Have to.

425
00:24:07.142 --> 00:24:08.448
We have to.

426
00:24:10.014 --> 00:24:13.453
Build that wall!
Build that wall!


427
00:24:19.807 --> 00:24:21.809
Remember, we had a great canary
in the mineshaft. We had Brexit.


428
00:24:23.811 --> 00:24:24.899
Nigel Farage says,

429
00:24:24.986 --> 00:24:26.335
"Brexit would not have happened

430
00:24:26.422 --> 00:24:28.946
if there was not
Breitbart London."


431
00:24:29.033 --> 00:24:31.253
I could see Brexit and 2016

432
00:24:31.340 --> 00:24:33.734
are inextricably linked,
they're inextricably linked.


433
00:24:33.821 --> 00:24:34.996
It's just going to be
three verticals


434
00:24:35.083 --> 00:24:36.737
we're going to focus on.

435
00:24:36.824 --> 00:24:39.609
Number one, we've got to stop
mass illegal immigration


436
00:24:39.696 --> 00:24:41.742
and limit legal immigration
to get our sovereignty back


437
00:24:41.829 --> 00:24:43.483
and protect our workers.

438
00:24:43.570 --> 00:24:45.920
Number two, we have to bring
manufacturing jobs back,


439
00:24:46.007 --> 00:24:47.748
basically from Asia.

440
00:24:47.835 --> 00:24:49.967
And number three, we have
to get out of


441
00:24:50.054 --> 00:24:51.316
these pointless foreign wars.

442
00:24:57.845 --> 00:24:59.760
So, her thing,
when she came out,


443
00:24:59.847 --> 00:25:03.372
was, "Breitbart's racist,
Bannon's a white supremacist."


444
00:25:03.459 --> 00:25:05.026
I walked in,
it was like the fifth day,


445
00:25:05.113 --> 00:25:06.941
I go into the war room
with all these TV sets


446
00:25:07.028 --> 00:25:09.683
and she's in Reno
giving her first speech.


447
00:25:09.770 --> 00:25:11.032
And she's giving a speech
on the alt-right,


448
00:25:11.119 --> 00:25:12.947
and Breitbart and Steve Bannon.

449
00:25:13.034 --> 00:25:14.688
And I'm going,

450
00:25:14.775 --> 00:25:16.341
"She's running for President
of the United States."


451
00:25:16.428 --> 00:25:18.605
I said,
"She's walked into the trap."


452
00:25:18.692 --> 00:25:21.782
This is not conservatism
as we have known it.


453
00:25:21.869 --> 00:25:25.394
This is not republicanism
as we have known it.


454
00:25:25.481 --> 00:25:28.397
These are racist ideas,
race-baiting ideas,


455
00:25:28.484 --> 00:25:31.966
anti-Muslim, anti-immigrant,
anti-women,


456
00:25:32.053 --> 00:25:34.621
all key tenets making up

457
00:25:34.708 --> 00:25:38.799
the emerging racist ideology
known as the alt-right.


458
00:25:38.886 --> 00:25:41.062
A fringe element

459
00:25:41.149 --> 00:25:44.152
that has effectively taken over
the Republican party.


460
00:25:44.239 --> 00:25:47.155
If she's going to preach
identity politics,


461
00:25:47.242 --> 00:25:50.506
and we preach
populism and jobs


462
00:25:50.593 --> 00:25:52.726
and bringing manufacturing
jobs back, we got it.


463
00:25:52.813 --> 00:25:54.815
For all their brilliance
and all their money


464
00:25:54.902 --> 00:25:56.817
and all their professionalism,

465
00:25:56.904 --> 00:25:59.994
they don't have an understanding
of what this election's about,


466
00:26:00.081 --> 00:26:01.604
and that's when I knew
we had her.


467
00:26:01.691 --> 00:26:03.737
Operator, operator.

468
00:26:03.824 --> 00:26:06.696
You have to have
faith in your plan.


469
00:26:06.783 --> 00:26:08.437
That's one of the lessons
of Twelve O'Clock High.


470
00:26:15.705 --> 00:26:17.577
So this is war.

471
00:26:19.274 --> 00:26:21.668
It's absolutely war.

472
00:26:21.755 --> 00:26:23.408
At that level of politics,
it's war.


473
00:26:25.149 --> 00:26:26.498
You're fighting for control

474
00:26:26.586 --> 00:26:28.022
of the greatest
country in the world.


475
00:26:30.981 --> 00:26:34.028
It's war.

476
00:26:34.115 --> 00:26:37.771
War is three phases. Step one,
take the high moral ground,


477
00:26:37.858 --> 00:26:40.948
so you can motivate people
to fight. Number two...


478
00:26:41.035 --> 00:26:44.386
leave a smoking hole
of where your enemy is,


479
00:26:44.473 --> 00:26:48.608
and number three, fill said hole
with your stuff and your values.


480
00:26:50.131 --> 00:26:52.481
We're doing debate prep.

481
00:26:52.568 --> 00:26:54.875
The Washington Post calls
Hope Hicks,


482
00:26:54.962 --> 00:26:57.617
gives her a transcript of some
audio that's going to come out.


483
00:27:00.315 --> 00:27:02.317
I talked to the,
I think the writer's editor,


484
00:27:02.404 --> 00:27:04.145
"Get us the audio
and let us check it,


485
00:27:04.232 --> 00:27:06.060
and we'll get back to you
sometime next week."


486
00:27:06.147 --> 00:27:10.238
And this guy said, "Hey, look,
it's going up in five minutes."


487
00:27:12.153 --> 00:27:14.503
"The authentication process
should be very quick."


488
00:27:19.987 --> 00:27:22.816
As soon as it went up I knew
it was going to be a huge issue.


489
00:27:22.903 --> 00:27:24.165
The Republican establishment,

490
00:27:24.252 --> 00:27:25.688
they were going
to cut Trump loose


491
00:27:25.775 --> 00:27:27.647
to focus on
the House and the Senate.


492
00:27:27.734 --> 00:27:30.606
We were going to do some sort of
video or something that night,


493
00:27:30.693 --> 00:27:32.608
which we didn't get out
until like midnight.


494
00:27:32.695 --> 00:27:35.089
People say it was
the hostage video.


495
00:27:35.176 --> 00:27:37.091
I've never said
I'm a perfect person,


496
00:27:37.178 --> 00:27:39.267
nor pretended to be
someone that I'm not.


497
00:27:39.354 --> 00:27:41.835
I've said and done
things I regret,


498
00:27:41.922 --> 00:27:45.099
and the words released today
on this than a decade-old video


499
00:27:45.186 --> 00:27:46.883
are one of them.

500
00:27:46.970 --> 00:27:49.625
There's a big difference
between the words and actions


501
00:27:49.712 --> 00:27:51.322
of other people.

502
00:27:51.409 --> 00:27:53.934
We will discuss this more
in the coming days.


503
00:27:54.021 --> 00:27:56.023
See you at the debate
on Sunday.


504
00:28:05.728 --> 00:28:07.295
On Saturday,

505
00:28:07.382 --> 00:28:09.819
we had called an all-hands
high command meeting


506
00:28:09.906 --> 00:28:13.214
to be in Trump Tower,
in the penthouse.


507
00:28:13.301 --> 00:28:15.956
We kind of went around.
Christy and Rudy


508
00:28:16.043 --> 00:28:18.959
give a traditional
politician's response:


509
00:28:19.046 --> 00:28:20.569
"Let's call 60 Minutes,

510
00:28:20.656 --> 00:28:23.572
have Melania on one side
and Ivanka on the other,


511
00:28:23.659 --> 00:28:25.792
and you'll be in the middle,
and you'll beg forgiveness."


512
00:28:25.879 --> 00:28:28.751
I was sitting there
just thinking that
if he does that it's over.


513
00:28:28.838 --> 00:28:32.755
I said, "They don't care
about anything in Billy Bush.


514
00:28:32.842 --> 00:28:35.323
What they care about is they're
losing their country


515
00:28:35.410 --> 00:28:37.151
and they're losing
their jobs,


516
00:28:37.238 --> 00:28:38.674
and they're losing
their way of life.


517
00:28:38.761 --> 00:28:40.981
And if they see you
as the instrument


518
00:28:41.068 --> 00:28:42.809
to reverse that,

519
00:28:42.896 --> 00:28:44.636
we're going to win
and we're going to win big.


520
00:28:44.724 --> 00:28:47.683
You have a 100 percent
metaphysical certitude to win.


521
00:28:49.816 --> 00:28:51.252
What we ought to do
is have a rally.


522
00:28:51.339 --> 00:28:53.341
Let's go to the Hilton Hotel

523
00:28:53.428 --> 00:28:56.692
and get a thousand people
red hats,


524
00:28:56.779 --> 00:28:58.999
double down, triple down,
and let's just do it."


525
00:29:01.610 --> 00:29:03.090
This is not Steve Bannon
pushing him.


526
00:29:03.177 --> 00:29:05.092
His natural thing was to fight.

527
00:29:05.179 --> 00:29:08.573
The compromise was that we were
gonna go on ABC and David Muir


528
00:29:08.660 --> 00:29:10.793
and we were going to do
a live interview,


529
00:29:10.880 --> 00:29:13.274
have a middle ground between
sitting on the sofa


530
00:29:13.361 --> 00:29:17.191
and apologizing and having
a rally where he basically said,


531
00:29:17.278 --> 00:29:20.237
"I don't care. I want
to talk about build a wall."


532
00:29:20.324 --> 00:29:23.023
And...

533
00:29:23.110 --> 00:29:25.373
as he got down
to the conference room,


534
00:29:25.460 --> 00:29:27.070
tried to practice, he said,

535
00:29:27.157 --> 00:29:29.072
"I can't do this.
And I'm not going to do this."


536
00:29:31.031 --> 00:29:33.120
Downstairs, there were thousands
of people in the streets.


537
00:29:35.862 --> 00:29:37.646
Many of them anti
-Trump.

538
00:29:46.220 --> 00:29:47.874
But there were a lot of
Deplorables down there


539
00:29:47.961 --> 00:29:49.614
in the red caps.

540
00:29:53.488 --> 00:29:55.055
He told the Secret Service right
there in the room, he goes,


541
00:29:55.142 --> 00:29:57.057
"I'm going down
and seeing my people."


542
00:29:57.144 --> 00:29:59.581
He just, he's going to go out
and hold a rally right there.


543
00:30:10.418 --> 00:30:12.115
Donald Trump! Donald Trump!

544
00:30:22.343 --> 00:30:24.432
Are you staying in, Mr. Trump?

545
00:30:24.519 --> 00:30:30.612
-Are you staying in the race?
-100%.


546
00:30:30.699 --> 00:30:32.092
Governor Christie pulled me
aside and we had


547
00:30:32.179 --> 00:30:33.528
a little tête-à-tête.

548
00:30:33.615 --> 00:30:36.270
He blamed me
for being the enabler.


549
00:30:36.357 --> 00:30:37.793
What he had argued
up there was that


550
00:30:37.880 --> 00:30:38.925
this is not about
the campaign.


551
00:30:39.012 --> 00:30:40.665
The campaign's over.

552
00:30:40.752 --> 00:30:44.017
If you go down this path
of what this crazy guy's saying,


553
00:30:44.104 --> 00:30:46.280
you're going to not just
lose this campaign


554
00:30:46.367 --> 00:30:48.935
and lose it by a historic number
but you're going to,


555
00:30:49.022 --> 00:30:51.111
you're going to destroy
your brand.


556
00:30:51.198 --> 00:30:53.940
And it will have
massive impact afterwards.


557
00:30:54.027 --> 00:30:57.160
And so Christie and I got into
it, and I basically told him,


558
00:30:57.247 --> 00:30:59.815
"The plane leaves
at 11:00 tomorrow.


559
00:30:59.902 --> 00:31:01.861
"If you're on the plane,
you're on the team.


560
00:31:01.948 --> 00:31:03.036
You're not on the plane,
you're not on the team."


561
00:31:14.961 --> 00:31:16.745
In that moment,

562
00:31:16.832 --> 00:31:21.489
I had people who would come
as first person testifiers


563
00:31:21.576 --> 00:31:25.362
of the actions of Bill Clinton
and her actions as an enabler,


564
00:31:25.449 --> 00:31:27.321
so I had personal witnesses.

565
00:31:27.408 --> 00:31:30.150
Paula Jones and Kathleen Willey
and others.


566
00:31:30.237 --> 00:31:32.195
At about 4:00 on Friday,

567
00:31:32.282 --> 00:31:34.676
I called up and made sure
that the women


568
00:31:34.763 --> 00:31:38.680
that were being filmed would be
actually in St. Louis on Sunday.


569
00:31:38.767 --> 00:31:41.248
So it was your idea to
bring the women to the debate.


570
00:31:41.335 --> 00:31:42.771
Yeah, 100 percent, yes.

571
00:31:53.260 --> 00:31:56.567
Went up to candidate Trump.
"Here's the plan.


572
00:31:57.960 --> 00:31:59.788
We're going to open the door

573
00:31:59.875 --> 00:32:04.358
and let the pack of jackals
opposition party media come in,


574
00:32:04.445 --> 00:32:07.013
thinking they were seeing
the end of the debate prep,


575
00:32:07.100 --> 00:32:09.624
and these women would
just hit 'em with a fuselage


576
00:32:09.711 --> 00:32:12.540
at one time of,
"Bill Clinton raped me."


577
00:32:12.627 --> 00:32:14.803
And he goes, "I love it."

578
00:32:16.631 --> 00:32:19.547
He took his seat
in the middle.


579
00:32:19.634 --> 00:32:21.549
We open the door
to the media.


580
00:32:21.636 --> 00:32:22.942
They'd walked right
into the traps.


581
00:32:33.126 --> 00:32:34.823
You could tell,
it gave him confidence.


582
00:32:35.519 --> 00:32:37.217
Mr. Trump--

583
00:32:37.304 --> 00:32:39.045
Mr. Trump, you touched a woman
without her consent.


584
00:32:39.132 --> 00:32:41.003
Mr. Trump.

585
00:32:41.090 --> 00:32:43.614
Why'd you say you touch women
without consent, Mr. Trump?


586
00:32:43.701 --> 00:32:45.138
We're talking Bill Clinton now.

587
00:32:45.225 --> 00:32:47.227
Why don't you all go ask
Bill Clinton that?


588
00:32:47.314 --> 00:32:49.577
Go ahead, ask Hillary as well.

589
00:32:52.145 --> 00:32:53.798
The debate before,
they had allowed


590
00:32:53.885 --> 00:32:56.976
Mark Cuban to come down
and sit in his line of sight


591
00:32:57.063 --> 00:32:59.108
to glare at him the entire time.

592
00:32:59.195 --> 00:33:01.023
I said, "Just go get him,
and put him back


593
00:33:01.110 --> 00:33:03.417
"in the seat in darkness.
It's 10 rows back.


594
00:33:03.504 --> 00:33:05.506
It's simple, aisle seat,

595
00:33:05.593 --> 00:33:07.073
No, completely blown off.

596
00:33:08.161 --> 00:33:09.945
So this time,

597
00:33:10.032 --> 00:33:11.338
we're gonna walk out
the four women,


598
00:33:11.425 --> 00:33:13.122
and put them in the VIP seats

599
00:33:13.209 --> 00:33:15.168
and make Bill Clinton,
on national TV, walk past 'em.


600
00:33:15.255 --> 00:33:18.084
And so we just told the guys,
"Hey, we got different VIPs."


601
00:33:20.434 --> 00:33:22.175
And they go, "Oh no, it's
impossible. You can't do that."


602
00:33:26.179 --> 00:33:28.790
"Dude, two weeks ago,
you gave me this speech


603
00:33:28.877 --> 00:33:31.793
about you don't have control
over security."


604
00:33:31.880 --> 00:33:34.187
"What's good for the goose
is good for the gander.


605
00:33:34.274 --> 00:33:36.711
They're going to sit in those
seats, and when he comes by,


606
00:33:36.798 --> 00:33:38.669
they're gonna say
whatever they're gonna say


607
00:33:38.756 --> 00:33:40.497
and you're gonna
live with it."


608
00:33:40.584 --> 00:33:43.674
And it got to be show time.

609
00:33:43.761 --> 00:33:44.893
We've already
rattled them enough.


610
00:33:48.244 --> 00:33:50.899
We did jujutsu, and we turned
the Billy Bush thing around.


611
00:34:17.012 --> 00:34:20.015
It comes down to one or two,

612
00:34:20.102 --> 00:34:22.191
maybe three moments
the entire time,


613
00:34:22.278 --> 00:34:25.499
and you're gonna make a decision
under pressure in the moment


614
00:34:25.586 --> 00:34:26.891
and that decision is either

615
00:34:26.978 --> 00:34:28.154
gonna lead
to victory or defeat.


616
00:34:28.241 --> 00:34:29.894
And if you pick
the wrong path,


617
00:34:29.981 --> 00:34:31.679
you'll look back
in hindsight and see


618
00:34:31.766 --> 00:34:33.550
how your defeat came about.

619
00:34:35.335 --> 00:34:38.338
It wasn't a perfect campaign.

620
00:34:38.425 --> 00:34:40.383
There is no such thing.

621
00:34:41.515 --> 00:34:43.865
But I was on the way to winning

622
00:34:43.952 --> 00:34:48.174
until a combination of
Jim Comey's letter on October 28


623
00:34:48.261 --> 00:34:50.785
and Russian Wikileaks

624
00:34:50.872 --> 00:34:53.701
raised doubts
in the minds of people


625
00:34:53.788 --> 00:34:57.139
who were inclined to vote
for me, but got scared off.


626
00:34:57.226 --> 00:34:59.054
Ask yourself this.

627
00:34:59.141 --> 00:35:01.926
Within an hour or two

628
00:35:02.013 --> 00:35:06.366
of the Hollywood Access tape
being made public,


629
00:35:06.453 --> 00:35:10.283
the Russian theft of John
Podesta's e-mail hit Wikileaks.


630
00:35:11.849 --> 00:35:14.896
The reason why
I believe we lost


631
00:35:14.983 --> 00:35:17.638
were the intervening events
in the last ten days.


632
00:35:24.340 --> 00:35:27.604
This just came out.
This just came out.


633
00:35:27.691 --> 00:35:29.737
Wikileaks! I love Wikileaks.

634
00:35:33.393 --> 00:35:37.092
Hillary had no defense for her
secret speeches to Wall Street,


635
00:35:37.179 --> 00:35:39.399
at international banks

636
00:35:39.486 --> 00:35:43.664
that she hid from the public and
which were exposed by Wikileaks!


637
00:35:43.751 --> 00:35:45.492
The FBI...

638
00:35:49.539 --> 00:35:52.020
has just sent a letter
to Congress...


639
00:35:53.500 --> 00:35:55.980
informing them

640
00:35:56.067 --> 00:35:58.113
that they have discovered
new e-mails


641
00:36:02.248 --> 00:36:06.426
pertaining to
the former Secretary of State,


642
00:36:06.513 --> 00:36:08.515
Hillary Clinton's
investigation.


643
00:36:09.907 --> 00:36:13.476
Lock her up! Lock her up!

644
00:36:13.563 --> 00:36:17.045
Lock her up! Lock her up! Lock!

645
00:36:31.712 --> 00:36:34.845
What's interesting to
me about this whole election,


646
00:36:34.932 --> 00:36:39.154
the moment that her emails
became connected


647
00:36:39.241 --> 00:36:44.290
with Anthony Weiner's dick pics,
she was done for.


648
00:36:44.377 --> 00:36:46.901
And you ran an ad,
it's basically,


649
00:36:46.988 --> 00:36:50.470
I guess you'd call it
from the Roy Cohn playbook.


650
00:36:50.557 --> 00:36:55.692
You call me a pervert, I'm not
a pervert, you're a pervert!


651
00:36:55.779 --> 00:36:58.260
Decades of lies,
cover-ups and scandal


652
00:36:58.347 --> 00:37:00.393
have finally caught up
with Hillary Clinton.


653
00:37:00.480 --> 00:37:04.005
Hillary Clinton is
under FBI investigation again,


654
00:37:04.092 --> 00:37:07.095
after her emails were found on
pervert Anthony Weiner's laptop.


655
00:37:07.182 --> 00:37:08.792
Think about that.

656
00:37:08.879 --> 00:37:11.317
America's most sensitive
secrets, unlawfully sent,


657
00:37:11.404 --> 00:37:13.667
received, and exposed
by Hillary Clinton,


658
00:37:13.754 --> 00:37:15.669
her staff,
and Anthony Weiner?


659
00:37:15.756 --> 00:37:17.323
Hillary cannot lead a nation

660
00:37:17.410 --> 00:37:20.326
while crippled by
a criminal investigation.


661
00:37:20.413 --> 00:37:23.067
Hillary Clinton,
unfit to serve.


662
00:37:23.154 --> 00:37:26.506
The 16 candidates
the Republicans had,


663
00:37:26.593 --> 00:37:28.072
whether you're a libertarian,

664
00:37:28.159 --> 00:37:29.683
whether you're a limited
government conservative,


665
00:37:29.770 --> 00:37:31.554
whether you're
a Heritage guy,


666
00:37:31.641 --> 00:37:36.080
Rand Paul, Chris Christie,
Ted Cruz, Jeb Bush, Marco Rubio,


667
00:37:36.167 --> 00:37:38.431
all of them combined,

668
00:37:38.518 --> 00:37:40.955
could not have beaten
Hillary Clinton.


669
00:37:41.042 --> 00:37:42.609
It took
a blunt force instrument.


670
00:37:42.696 --> 00:37:44.524
He understands
that the modern world,


671
00:37:44.611 --> 00:37:45.699
particularly the modern
political world,


672
00:37:45.786 --> 00:37:48.092
has become media.

673
00:37:48.179 --> 00:37:50.747
The medium is the message,
and he understands that.


674
00:37:50.834 --> 00:37:53.750
That's why he can speak in
a very plainspoken vernacular,


675
00:37:53.837 --> 00:37:55.274
not in political speak.

676
00:37:58.451 --> 00:37:59.626
He's an armor-piercing shell.

677
00:38:03.151 --> 00:38:06.720
From the first day he came on
the campaign in June of 2015


678
00:38:06.807 --> 00:38:09.157
until today,
the news cycle's Trump.


679
00:38:11.202 --> 00:38:13.901
He has taken over
people's brains.


680
00:38:13.988 --> 00:38:15.468
That he has.

681
00:38:21.343 --> 00:38:23.476
You could not be
politically correct


682
00:38:23.563 --> 00:38:26.957
and defeat the Clinton apparatus
or the Clinton junta.


683
00:38:27.044 --> 00:38:28.698
You need to be
a blunt force instrument.


684
00:38:28.785 --> 00:38:31.484
Do you really think that
she is more corrupt


685
00:38:31.571 --> 00:38:34.748
than say, President Trump?

686
00:38:34.835 --> 00:38:37.968
I don't think Trump's corrupt.
I don't think he's corrupt.


687
00:38:38.055 --> 00:38:39.753
Now he's certainly--
I don't think he's corrupt.


688
00:38:39.840 --> 00:38:41.363
He comes from outside
the government.


689
00:38:41.450 --> 00:38:43.757
He's a real estate guy.

690
00:38:43.844 --> 00:38:45.454
You can be corrupt
outside the government.


691
00:38:48.239 --> 00:38:50.416
Has he been in lawsuits
and had bankruptcies?


692
00:38:50.503 --> 00:38:52.331
That's the real estate
business.


693
00:39:07.868 --> 00:39:10.697
One of the keys to
the campaign was, giving people


694
00:39:10.784 --> 00:39:12.612
permission to vote for him?

695
00:39:12.699 --> 00:39:17.399
Right? At the end, I think there
was up to, like, 15 to 18%,


696
00:39:17.486 --> 00:39:19.967
some huge number,
that had come to the conclusion


697
00:39:20.054 --> 00:39:22.230
they didn't like
either candidate.


698
00:39:22.317 --> 00:39:26.495
That broke, I think, something
like two-thirds to Trump.


699
00:39:26.582 --> 00:39:28.410
These are people that voted that
didn't like either candidate,


700
00:39:28.497 --> 00:39:30.369
but picked
the lesser of two evils,


701
00:39:30.456 --> 00:39:32.458
or the agent of change.

702
00:39:32.545 --> 00:39:36.549
What our job is, as a people,

703
00:39:36.636 --> 00:39:39.160
is to tell the establishment,

704
00:39:39.247 --> 00:39:42.511
the big money interests, the
wealthy campaign contributors,


705
00:39:42.598 --> 00:39:46.994
the Congress, is
the status quo is not working


706
00:39:47.081 --> 00:39:52.042
for working Americans,
and we demand change.


707
00:39:52.129 --> 00:39:57.352
If you had been Bernie
Sanders' campaign director,


708
00:39:57.439 --> 00:39:59.093
would he have won?

709
00:39:59.180 --> 00:40:01.269
He would have definitely
been taking on Donald Trump


710
00:40:01.356 --> 00:40:03.924
as the Democratic nominee,
there's no doubt about that.


711
00:40:04.011 --> 00:40:05.839
Look at the crowds
he was drawing.


712
00:40:05.926 --> 00:40:07.580
It wasn't that
he didn't have the enthusiasm.


713
00:40:07.667 --> 00:40:09.495
Look what he did
with the Millennials.


714
00:40:09.582 --> 00:40:15.544
I can't tell you
how annoyed my son is with me


715
00:40:15.631 --> 00:40:18.895
for voting for Hillary
in the primaries.


716
00:40:18.982 --> 00:40:23.247
My God, you just crushed me.
How did you do that?


717
00:40:23.334 --> 00:40:24.771
How did you possibly
vote for Hillary Clinton?


718
00:40:24.858 --> 00:40:26.381
I'm kind of shocked now.

719
00:40:26.468 --> 00:40:29.297
How could you possibly
make Fog of War,


720
00:40:29.384 --> 00:40:31.734
and how could you make,
what, Known Unknowns,


721
00:40:31.821 --> 00:40:34.955
how could you make this and
then vote for Hillary Clinton?


722
00:40:35.042 --> 00:40:36.565
-Because I was--
-We are...


723
00:40:36.652 --> 00:40:37.958
You're asking me.
It's a question!


724
00:40:38.045 --> 00:40:39.481
We got to swap places now.

725
00:40:39.568 --> 00:40:42.484
Yeah, because I was afraid
of you guys.


726
00:40:42.571 --> 00:40:44.268
I still am.

727
00:40:46.662 --> 00:40:52.799
I thought that
she was the best hope


728
00:40:52.886 --> 00:40:55.279
of defeating Trump.

729
00:40:58.805 --> 00:41:00.241
And Bannon.

730
00:41:02.069 --> 00:41:03.984
I did it out of fear.

731
00:41:06.247 --> 00:41:08.467
I don't know how better
to describe it.


732
00:41:14.211 --> 00:41:16.475
We're at the very
beginning stages


733
00:41:16.562 --> 00:41:18.912
of a very brutal
and bloody conflict,


734
00:41:18.999 --> 00:41:20.827
of which
if the people in this room


735
00:41:20.914 --> 00:41:22.959
and the people in the church
do not bind together


736
00:41:23.046 --> 00:41:24.657
and really for what I feel

737
00:41:24.744 --> 00:41:26.963
is an aspect
of the Church Militant,


738
00:41:27.050 --> 00:41:30.010
to really be able to not
just stand with our beliefs


739
00:41:30.097 --> 00:41:31.664
but to fight for our beliefs

740
00:41:31.751 --> 00:41:34.362
against this new barbarity
that's starting,


741
00:41:34.449 --> 00:41:37.104
that we will literally
eradicate everything


742
00:41:37.191 --> 00:41:42.457
that we've been bequeathed over
the last 2,000 to 2,500 years.


743
00:41:42.544 --> 00:41:45.286
But we are in an outright war

744
00:41:45.373 --> 00:41:49.116
against jihadist Islam,
Islamic fascism.


745
00:41:58.299 --> 00:42:01.128
What I'd like to do is
retrace how you became involved


746
00:42:01.215 --> 00:42:02.956
in all of this,

747
00:42:03.043 --> 00:42:05.524
from I guess the beginnings.

748
00:42:06.655 --> 00:42:08.004
You're a filmmaker.

749
00:42:09.876 --> 00:42:13.793
Then you're the executive
chairman of Breitbart.


750
00:42:13.880 --> 00:42:18.841
Then you're the head
of the Trump campaign,


751
00:42:18.928 --> 00:42:23.063
and then you're
a central advisor


752
00:42:23.150 --> 00:42:24.978
to the President
of the United States.


753
00:42:25.065 --> 00:42:26.849
It's quite a trajectory.

754
00:42:29.504 --> 00:42:31.898
So let's go back to the
beginning. How did this start?


755
00:42:34.944 --> 00:42:38.513
You tell the story
of the current war you're in


756
00:42:38.600 --> 00:42:40.559
by talking about
previous wars.


757
00:42:42.430 --> 00:42:44.432
And I'll use Reagan
as the insurance.


758
00:42:46.608 --> 00:42:48.436
And I'll tell the story

759
00:42:48.523 --> 00:42:51.091
about how we have to confront
radical Islamic terrorism.


760
00:42:54.268 --> 00:42:56.357
I said,
"This is a real enemy.


761
00:42:56.444 --> 00:42:58.751
It's a real enemy
that can inspire,


762
00:42:58.838 --> 00:43:00.579
just like in
Twelve O'Clock High.


763
00:43:03.364 --> 00:43:06.193
And so I made
In the Face of Evilin 2004.


764
00:43:08.108 --> 00:43:09.762
Ronald Reagan was the product

765
00:43:09.849 --> 00:43:12.068
of the Hollywood studio system.

766
00:43:12.155 --> 00:43:13.722
A system that took the story

767
00:43:13.809 --> 00:43:16.116
of the immigrants
and pioneers' efforts


768
00:43:16.203 --> 00:43:18.945
to forge a country
from a vast wilderness,


769
00:43:19.032 --> 00:43:21.861
and turned it
into a heroic struggle.


770
00:43:21.948 --> 00:43:25.691
Order versus chaos,
good versus evil,


771
00:43:25.778 --> 00:43:28.563
translating western
civilizations' legends


772
00:43:28.650 --> 00:43:33.133
into simple stories that
embodied the reluctant hero.


773
00:43:33.220 --> 00:43:36.615
These stories defined
what it meant to be a man,


774
00:43:38.007 --> 00:43:40.096
what it took to be a hero.

775
00:43:41.663 --> 00:43:44.971
That freedom
is a fragile thing.


776
00:43:45.058 --> 00:43:48.627
That evil is powerless
if the good are unafraid.


777
00:43:53.675 --> 00:43:55.155
When the film was shown

778
00:43:55.242 --> 00:43:56.983
at this conservative
Hollywood film festival,


779
00:43:57.070 --> 00:43:58.593
it got like
a 10-minute standing ovation


780
00:43:58.680 --> 00:44:00.900
at the end, and some
huge bear of a guy


781
00:44:00.987 --> 00:44:03.903
comes barreling out of
the audience and embraces me.


782
00:44:03.990 --> 00:44:05.818
He says, "We've got
to take the culture back


783
00:44:05.905 --> 00:44:07.167
and culture's
upriver from politics."


784
00:44:07.254 --> 00:44:08.908
And I said, "Who is this guy?

785
00:44:08.995 --> 00:44:12.259
This guy is like a giant of
a man and full of life.


786
00:44:12.346 --> 00:44:14.087
It was Andrew Breitbart.

787
00:44:17.003 --> 00:44:18.918
For five years
I didn't make a film,


788
00:44:19.005 --> 00:44:20.833
and then I saw
the financial crisis.


789
00:44:20.920 --> 00:44:22.965
I came up with the idea
of telling the story


790
00:44:23.052 --> 00:44:27.448
to Generation Z.

791
00:44:27.535 --> 00:44:29.624
We're going to make
an avant-garde film


792
00:44:29.711 --> 00:44:31.452
for right-wingers.

793
00:44:33.019 --> 00:44:34.542
Now, history teaches

794
00:44:34.629 --> 00:44:37.284
that usually third
turnings finally issue


795
00:44:37.371 --> 00:44:39.460
into a fourth turning.

796
00:44:39.547 --> 00:44:41.810
And a fourth turning
is the crisis.


797
00:44:41.897 --> 00:44:43.986
And history shows
that if an event


798
00:44:44.073 --> 00:44:46.293
doesn't trigger
a fourth turning,


799
00:44:46.380 --> 00:44:48.121
a fourth turning leader
will actually


800
00:44:48.208 --> 00:44:49.688
encourage one to happen.

801
00:44:49.775 --> 00:44:51.733
Or one will simply hit us

802
00:44:51.820 --> 00:44:54.823
because of all the deferred
public decisions


803
00:44:54.910 --> 00:44:57.217
that weren't made during
the recent third turning.


804
00:44:57.304 --> 00:45:00.307
This comes to a head
in the fourth turning.


805
00:45:00.394 --> 00:45:04.180
I wanted to show it
to conservative thought leaders


806
00:45:04.267 --> 00:45:06.008
before we released it,

807
00:45:06.095 --> 00:45:08.750
and so I went to see
Andrew Breitbart.


808
00:45:08.837 --> 00:45:13.799
He had started this blog site
called Breitbart.


809
00:45:13.886 --> 00:45:16.410
He said, "We're really trying
to turn it into a business,


810
00:45:16.497 --> 00:45:17.977
and I know you're
an investment banker..."


811
00:45:18.064 --> 00:45:19.152
And I said,
"Look, if you ever need any help


812
00:45:19.239 --> 00:45:20.762
putting together
a business plan,


813
00:45:20.849 --> 00:45:22.546
or just thinking about
financing, let's talk."


814
00:45:22.633 --> 00:45:25.245
He said, "I'd love to. I'd love
to have somebody do that."


815
00:45:25.332 --> 00:45:27.769
And so he said,
"How about tomorrow?"


816
00:45:27.856 --> 00:45:31.207
And I said, "Sure. Where
are you guys headquartered?"


817
00:45:31.294 --> 00:45:33.253
And he goes,
"In my basement."


818
00:45:33.340 --> 00:45:35.168
And we're sitting
in the main room,


819
00:45:35.255 --> 00:45:36.778
I hadn't seen
a lot of activity.


820
00:45:36.865 --> 00:45:38.345
It was an old blog site.

821
00:45:38.432 --> 00:45:40.086
It was just kind of
a rudimentary site,


822
00:45:40.173 --> 00:45:41.696
that put up,
you know, stories.


823
00:45:41.783 --> 00:45:43.524
We were going
to build an entire new site


824
00:45:43.611 --> 00:45:46.179
that Andrew had thought
through from scratch.


825
00:45:46.266 --> 00:45:49.791
As often happens
in life, we were late.


826
00:45:49.878 --> 00:45:53.839
Andrew had a lot of changes.
We needed 90 more days.


827
00:45:53.926 --> 00:45:56.624
Now, the year before

828
00:45:56.711 --> 00:45:58.931
Andrew had called
in the middle of the night


829
00:45:59.018 --> 00:46:02.369
and he said, "I feel like
I got a Volkswagen on my chest."


830
00:46:02.456 --> 00:46:06.808
He had genetic problems
with his heart,


831
00:46:06.895 --> 00:46:08.288
and he was in for four days
and given


832
00:46:08.375 --> 00:46:09.593
a whole regimen
of things to do.


833
00:46:11.552 --> 00:46:13.467
Of course, Andrew
didn't do any of it.


834
00:46:13.554 --> 00:46:16.862
Ho-ho! CPAC has got to go.
Hey, hey!


835
00:46:16.949 --> 00:46:20.082
Behave yourself!

836
00:46:20.169 --> 00:46:22.258
-You are freaks and animals.
-Chill!


837
00:46:22.345 --> 00:46:25.218
You're freaks and animals!
Behave yourself!


838
00:46:28.830 --> 00:46:30.440
Behave yourself?
Learn to behave yourself first.


839
00:46:30.527 --> 00:46:34.401
Stop raping people!
Stop raping! Stop raping!


840
00:46:34.488 --> 00:46:36.882
Stop raping people!

841
00:46:36.969 --> 00:46:39.885
Stop raping the people!

842
00:46:39.972 --> 00:46:43.323
You freaks! You filthy freaks!

843
00:46:43.410 --> 00:46:46.239
You filthy, filthy, filthy,

844
00:46:46.326 --> 00:46:48.807
raping, murdering freaks!

845
00:46:50.852 --> 00:46:52.898
We had this old warehouse.

846
00:46:52.985 --> 00:46:55.161
He would work every night there
until like 10 or 11 o'clock,


847
00:46:55.248 --> 00:46:58.251
and there was a restaurant
that was open until midnight


848
00:46:58.338 --> 00:47:00.079
and he would go to the bar
and have a quick bite to eat


849
00:47:00.166 --> 00:47:01.428
before going home.

850
00:47:01.515 --> 00:47:03.909
Sat next to a guy
and has dinner,


851
00:47:03.996 --> 00:47:06.259
paid his bill,
shook this guy's hand,


852
00:47:06.346 --> 00:47:09.523
walked outside to get his car

853
00:47:09.610 --> 00:47:10.654
and dropped dead
right on the street


854
00:47:10.741 --> 00:47:12.047
in front of the restaurant.

855
00:47:12.134 --> 00:47:14.354
Dead by the time
he hit the pavement.


856
00:47:14.441 --> 00:47:16.138
Talked to his widow Susie.

857
00:47:16.225 --> 00:47:19.098
She said, "Hey, he's dedicated
his life to this site.


858
00:47:19.185 --> 00:47:22.971
On Sunday night at 8:00, make
sure the curtain comes up."


859
00:47:23.058 --> 00:47:26.932
And that was the beginning
of the weaponized platform


860
00:47:27.019 --> 00:47:28.934
that was the backbone
of the populist media.


861
00:47:33.764 --> 00:47:37.029
You have someone who comes along
once in a generation.


862
00:47:37.116 --> 00:47:39.466
He knew new media.

863
00:47:39.553 --> 00:47:44.166
He had this strong sense
of how people come to the news


864
00:47:44.253 --> 00:47:45.776
in a different way.

865
00:47:45.864 --> 00:47:48.301
And he really had this
extraordinary vision


866
00:47:48.388 --> 00:47:50.956
of what he wanted to do
with Breitbart.


867
00:47:51.043 --> 00:47:53.219
You also had some
deeper understanding


868
00:47:53.306 --> 00:47:54.481
of the Internet.

869
00:47:54.568 --> 00:47:56.875
-Can we talk about IGE?
-Yeah.


870
00:48:00.008 --> 00:48:01.662
In the early 2000s,

871
00:48:01.749 --> 00:48:03.969
Wall Street was already
thinking through


872
00:48:04.056 --> 00:48:06.841
this whole concept
of alternative currencies


873
00:48:06.928 --> 00:48:10.584
coming out of massively
multiplayer video games.


874
00:48:10.671 --> 00:48:13.152
World of Warcraft
was one of them.


875
00:48:13.239 --> 00:48:15.763
Gold is generated, or things
are generated in that game,


876
00:48:15.850 --> 00:48:17.721
and there's a massive
aftermarket for it.


877
00:48:17.808 --> 00:48:20.159
And so investment banks,
sophisticated investment banks


878
00:48:20.246 --> 00:48:21.769
like Goldman Sachs,

879
00:48:21.856 --> 00:48:23.336
were always
on the lookout for


880
00:48:23.423 --> 00:48:24.511
what were
alternative currencies?


881
00:48:24.598 --> 00:48:26.339
We bought like 35 exchanges.

882
00:48:26.426 --> 00:48:29.255
Thirty-five exchanges,
what does that mean?


883
00:48:30.778 --> 00:48:34.695
People need weapons,
they need spells,


884
00:48:34.782 --> 00:48:37.567
so the gold
is an alternative currency.


885
00:48:39.787 --> 00:48:44.009
The aftermarket trading of that
is tens of billions of dollars.


886
00:48:45.793 --> 00:48:47.621
If you went to Kowloon,
if you went to Hong Kong


887
00:48:47.708 --> 00:48:49.014
in the early days,
you'd walk out,


888
00:48:49.101 --> 00:48:50.580
it was a trading floor.

889
00:48:52.974 --> 00:48:56.935
Of the 250 employees,

890
00:48:57.022 --> 00:48:59.938
They're in games,
generating gold.


891
00:49:02.375 --> 00:49:04.072
I became the interim CEO.

892
00:49:04.159 --> 00:49:06.901
We were generating a tremendous
amount of cash per month


893
00:49:06.988 --> 00:49:08.729
and then all of a sudden

894
00:49:08.816 --> 00:49:11.558
several million accounts
were wiped off


895
00:49:11.645 --> 00:49:13.299
by the game manufacturer.

896
00:49:13.386 --> 00:49:14.778
The game manufacturer
basically, said,


897
00:49:14.865 --> 00:49:16.389
"If you show up with
a social security number


898
00:49:16.476 --> 00:49:19.131
or a country ID to show
that you're a real person,


899
00:49:19.218 --> 00:49:20.306
you get your gold back."

900
00:49:23.004 --> 00:49:25.006
Well, that wipe off was,

901
00:49:25.093 --> 00:49:27.226
let's say in the neighborhood
of 90 million dollars.


902
00:49:30.533 --> 00:49:32.405
This was just not
an alternative currency,


903
00:49:32.492 --> 00:49:34.146
it was a currency currency.

904
00:49:34.233 --> 00:49:36.583
And so Stephen K. Bannon,
you got us into this,


905
00:49:36.670 --> 00:49:38.063
and now help sort it out.

906
00:49:38.150 --> 00:49:41.240
And the one thing
that struck me is...


907
00:49:41.327 --> 00:49:42.763
because I'm not
a video game person,


908
00:49:42.850 --> 00:49:44.983
I've never played
a video game in my life,


909
00:49:45.070 --> 00:49:46.245
never played a video game.

910
00:49:46.332 --> 00:49:49.074
And I said, "Wow,

911
00:49:49.161 --> 00:49:51.467
people spend an awful lot
of time in these video games.


912
00:49:51.554 --> 00:49:54.253
35, 40, 45, 50 hours a week,

913
00:49:54.340 --> 00:49:58.257
people with incomes of 75, 80,
$100,000 with wives and kids."


914
00:50:01.086 --> 00:50:03.088
Now I don't know
that this happened or not,


915
00:50:03.175 --> 00:50:05.873
but there's a guy, Dave,

916
00:50:07.222 --> 00:50:09.311
in the accounts payable
department.


917
00:50:09.398 --> 00:50:11.531
He weighs 250 pounds.

918
00:50:11.618 --> 00:50:14.664
He drops dead of a heart attack
in his cubicle.


919
00:50:14.751 --> 00:50:17.363
He's got a wife and two kids
who don't really know him.


920
00:50:17.450 --> 00:50:19.104
Some preacher from a church

921
00:50:19.191 --> 00:50:21.280
or some guy from the funeral
home that has never met him


922
00:50:21.367 --> 00:50:25.023
does a ten minute eulogy,
says a few prayers,


923
00:50:25.110 --> 00:50:27.677
and they've got one of
these perpetual cemeteries,


924
00:50:27.764 --> 00:50:30.332
and Dave's urn
goes down there.


925
00:50:30.419 --> 00:50:32.204
And that's Dave.

926
00:50:32.291 --> 00:50:34.902
Dave in the game, he's Ajax.

927
00:50:36.295 --> 00:50:38.471
And Ajax is like the man.

928
00:50:38.558 --> 00:50:41.474
When it comes to burying Ajax,

929
00:50:41.561 --> 00:50:43.476
they're going to put him
on a caisson,


930
00:50:43.563 --> 00:50:45.695
and they're going to take it up
for a funeral pyre,


931
00:50:45.782 --> 00:50:47.741
and they're going
to burn the digital Ajax.


932
00:50:47.828 --> 00:50:50.396
There's literally
thousands of people there.


933
00:50:52.746 --> 00:50:56.402
Their rival group,
that hates these guys,


934
00:50:56.489 --> 00:50:59.100
attacks the funeral thing.

935
00:50:59.187 --> 00:51:00.406
People are home
playing the game,


936
00:51:00.493 --> 00:51:02.103
and guys are not going to work

937
00:51:02.190 --> 00:51:04.236
and women are not going to work,
because it's Ajax.


938
00:51:06.107 --> 00:51:07.674
Now who's more real,

939
00:51:07.761 --> 00:51:10.068
Dave, in accounting,
that's in the urn,


940
00:51:10.155 --> 00:51:12.374
his analog self,
or is it Ajax?


941
00:51:13.680 --> 00:51:15.508
People take on
these digital selves


942
00:51:15.595 --> 00:51:18.511
that are a more perfected
version of themselves


943
00:51:18.598 --> 00:51:20.208
and where they
can control things


944
00:51:20.295 --> 00:51:23.255
in a digital way that
they can't in the analog world.


945
00:51:26.606 --> 00:51:29.043
Remember John Ford,

946
00:51:29.130 --> 00:51:30.523
My Darling Clementine?

947
00:51:32.525 --> 00:51:36.790
That's an idealized version
of the American West.


948
00:51:36.877 --> 00:51:39.923
That's what these digital
communities provide to people.


949
00:51:41.664 --> 00:51:44.928
That's what it provided to Ajax
and not Dave.


950
00:51:50.151 --> 00:51:55.069
Singing, "Shall We Gather at the River."

951
00:51:58.551 --> 00:51:59.900
That eventually
became my idea


952
00:51:59.987 --> 00:52:02.120
for the comments section
of Breitbart,


953
00:52:02.207 --> 00:52:03.730
which built
the Breitbart community,


954
00:52:03.817 --> 00:52:06.385
and is not for
the faint of heart.


955
00:52:06.472 --> 00:52:09.301
This became more of a community
than the city they live in,


956
00:52:09.388 --> 00:52:11.738
or the town they live in,
that the old bowling league,


957
00:52:11.825 --> 00:52:14.567
the old Kiwanis Club,
the old softball team


958
00:52:14.654 --> 00:52:17.309
to a large extent
was being replaced by this.


959
00:52:17.396 --> 00:52:20.225
You brought the old
bowling league to Breitbart?


960
00:52:20.312 --> 00:52:22.140
It's like sedimentary rock.

961
00:52:22.227 --> 00:52:25.186
The key to these sites
was the comments section.


962
00:52:25.273 --> 00:52:27.145
This could be weaponized
at some point in time.


963
00:52:30.757 --> 00:52:33.412
The angry voices

964
00:52:33.499 --> 00:52:35.588
properly directed

965
00:52:35.675 --> 00:52:38.112
have latent political power.

966
00:52:42.725 --> 00:52:44.945
Caught the Republican Party
completely unaware


967
00:52:45.032 --> 00:52:48.601
and drove much
of the momentum of Trump


968
00:52:48.688 --> 00:52:50.777
and also added
to the traffic of Breitbart


969
00:52:50.864 --> 00:52:52.692
and to Breitbart's
prominence and power.


970
00:53:06.749 --> 00:53:08.273
He's very superstitious.

971
00:53:08.360 --> 00:53:09.883
There was no concession
speech written,


972
00:53:09.970 --> 00:53:11.450
and there was
no victory speech written.


973
00:53:11.537 --> 00:53:12.668
Wouldn't do it.

974
00:53:19.719 --> 00:53:21.634
I look very much...

975
00:53:21.721 --> 00:53:25.290
forward to being
your President.


976
00:53:25.377 --> 00:53:30.686
And I can only say that
while the campaign is over,


977
00:53:30.773 --> 00:53:34.473
our work on this movement
is now really just beginning.


978
00:53:36.736 --> 00:53:38.868
Remember, at five o'clock
in the evening.


979
00:53:38.955 --> 00:53:42.481
we're told we're going to lose
in a historic landslide.


980
00:53:42.568 --> 00:53:44.700
I think on those exit polls

981
00:53:44.787 --> 00:53:47.181
she wins something
like 400 electoral votes


982
00:53:47.268 --> 00:53:50.880
and the House and the Senate
and the Supreme Court


983
00:53:50.967 --> 00:53:54.275
and life is changed
in perpetuity.


984
00:53:54.362 --> 00:53:56.582
That's eight hours before.

985
00:54:02.414 --> 00:54:04.894
Every newsroom is getting ready
and they're all high-fiving


986
00:54:04.981 --> 00:54:06.853
and Megyn Kelly's
got that big smirk on her face,


987
00:54:06.940 --> 00:54:09.421
like, "Oh, this is going to be
over at eight o'clock."


988
00:54:12.467 --> 00:54:16.515
You know, Miller and Bannon
and the others at 2:30,


989
00:54:16.602 --> 00:54:19.779
we're not sitting there saying,
"Let's have a group hug."


990
00:54:19.866 --> 00:54:22.521
Saying you know

991
00:54:22.608 --> 00:54:25.698
We just did it, and now we're
gonna march on the Capitol.


992
00:54:25.785 --> 00:54:27.961
Throw out all of them,

993
00:54:28.048 --> 00:54:31.269
I mean drop the hammer.
That's how we won.


994
00:54:31.356 --> 00:54:32.618
That's what people voted for.

995
00:54:32.705 --> 00:54:35.925
And it was Donald Trump
that said,


996
00:54:36.012 --> 00:54:37.318
"I think what we ought
to try to tonight


997
00:54:37.405 --> 00:54:39.364
"is bring people together.

998
00:54:39.451 --> 00:54:41.279
Let's de-escalate."

999
00:54:42.802 --> 00:54:44.760
Couple days later,

1000
00:54:44.847 --> 00:54:46.284
the resistance is
in the streets.


1001
00:54:50.810 --> 00:54:52.899
The signs and people
are so upset about this thing.


1002
00:54:58.252 --> 00:55:00.733
He actually said,
"I thought it'd be different.


1003
00:55:02.909 --> 00:55:04.519
I thought the New York Times

1004
00:55:04.606 --> 00:55:07.261
would be wishing me well
and everything like that."


1005
00:55:07.348 --> 00:55:10.612
And I said, "You do
understand they hate you.


1006
00:55:10.699 --> 00:55:13.093
They literally detest you.

1007
00:55:13.180 --> 00:55:15.791
Everything you ran on,
everything you stand for...


1008
00:55:17.227 --> 00:55:18.794
everything you won on.

1009
00:55:18.881 --> 00:55:21.406
And the people
that support you they detest.


1010
00:55:21.493 --> 00:55:23.756
This is gonna be
trench warfare every day."


1011
00:55:23.843 --> 00:55:26.411
And by the way, I'm the enabler
and I take great pride in it,


1012
00:55:26.498 --> 00:55:28.587
that just,
"Here's what we ran on,


1013
00:55:28.674 --> 00:55:30.197
"here's what we said
we're gonna do.


1014
00:55:30.284 --> 00:55:32.591
"Let's just do it.
You're not a politician.


1015
00:55:32.678 --> 00:55:34.506
"You're a leader.
Don't act like a politician.


1016
00:55:34.593 --> 00:55:37.117
"Just do it.

1017
00:55:37.204 --> 00:55:38.814
"Build the wall.

1018
00:55:38.901 --> 00:55:42.427
"Eradicate ISIS, right?

1019
00:55:42.514 --> 00:55:44.690
"Get manufacturing jobs
back here.


1020
00:55:44.777 --> 00:55:46.126
"Confront China.

1021
00:55:46.213 --> 00:55:47.693
"Get us out of Afghanistan.

1022
00:55:47.780 --> 00:55:49.259
"Get us out of Iraq.

1023
00:55:49.347 --> 00:55:50.696
Just do what you said
you're gonna do."


1024
00:55:58.399 --> 00:56:01.533
The inaugural address...

1025
00:56:01.620 --> 00:56:04.231
"American carnage,"
did you write that?


1026
00:56:05.537 --> 00:56:06.842
The President wrote that.

1027
00:56:07.408 --> 00:56:08.670
Come on.

1028
00:56:08.757 --> 00:56:10.803
It's President Trump's speech.

1029
00:56:10.890 --> 00:56:12.457
The only thing I told Miller

1030
00:56:12.544 --> 00:56:15.634
is we should have
the podium turned around.


1031
00:56:15.721 --> 00:56:17.723
Trump should address it

1032
00:56:17.810 --> 00:56:20.726
to all the elites in Washington
D.C. sitting in back of him.


1033
00:56:20.813 --> 00:56:22.641
If you look at the inner cities
in this country,


1034
00:56:22.728 --> 00:56:25.252
if you look at the industrial
heartland of this country,


1035
00:56:25.339 --> 00:56:26.775
there has been carnage.

1036
00:56:26.862 --> 00:56:28.516
Globalization has
brought carnage with it.


1037
00:56:28.603 --> 00:56:30.083
And it's got to be called that.

1038
00:56:30.170 --> 00:56:31.650
The people that are
most offended about that


1039
00:56:31.737 --> 00:56:33.391
is the mainstream media
and the globalists.


1040
00:56:33.478 --> 00:56:35.131
Bush hated the speech.

1041
00:56:35.218 --> 00:56:36.829
He said later, "That
thing's crazy" or something.


1042
00:56:36.916 --> 00:56:38.744
He made some really
derogatory comment.


1043
00:56:45.533 --> 00:56:47.883
Everyone is listening
to you now.


1044
00:56:50.103 --> 00:56:52.714
You came
by the tens of millions,


1045
00:56:52.801 --> 00:56:55.674
to become part of
a historic movement,


1046
00:56:55.761 --> 00:57:00.374
the likes of which the world
has never seen before.


1047
00:57:05.466 --> 00:57:07.860
At the center of this movement

1048
00:57:07.947 --> 00:57:10.471
is a crucial conviction

1049
00:57:10.558 --> 00:57:14.562
that a nation exists
to serve its citizens.


1050
00:57:17.347 --> 00:57:20.568
Americans want great schools
for their children,


1051
00:57:20.655 --> 00:57:23.049
safe neighborhoods
for their families,


1052
00:57:23.136 --> 00:57:25.704
and good jobs
for themselves.


1053
00:57:33.146 --> 00:57:39.848
These are just and reasonable
demands of righteous people.


1054
00:57:43.722 --> 00:57:45.593
But for too many
of our citizens,


1055
00:57:45.680 --> 00:57:48.335
a different reality exists.

1056
00:57:48.422 --> 00:57:52.731
Mothers and children trapped
in poverty in our inner cities.


1057
00:57:52.818 --> 00:57:54.994
Rusted-out factories

1058
00:57:55.081 --> 00:57:57.649
scattered like tombstones
across the landscape.


1059
00:58:02.175 --> 00:58:06.266
An education system
flush with cash,


1060
00:58:06.353 --> 00:58:09.095
but which leaves our young
and beautiful students


1061
00:58:09.182 --> 00:58:11.663
deprived of all knowledge.

1062
00:58:16.537 --> 00:58:20.585
And the crime and the gangs
and the drugs


1063
00:58:20.672 --> 00:58:24.197
that have stolen too many lives
and robbed our country


1064
00:58:24.284 --> 00:58:27.461
of so much
unrealized potential.


1065
00:58:33.032 --> 00:58:37.819
This American carnage
stops right here


1066
00:58:37.906 --> 00:58:40.692
and stops right now.

1067
00:58:52.747 --> 00:58:54.488
Do you ever see yourself

1068
00:58:54.575 --> 00:58:58.623
just hastening the end
of everything?


1069
00:58:58.710 --> 00:59:00.363
I don't think
we've hastened enough.


1070
00:59:00.450 --> 00:59:02.061
We're either going to make
some fundamental changes


1071
00:59:02.148 --> 00:59:04.193
or you're going
to have a revolution.


1072
00:59:04.280 --> 00:59:07.980
People say I'm apocalyptic.
I think I'm just a rationalist.


1073
00:59:08.067 --> 00:59:10.373
I foresaw someone
like Trump coming along.


1074
00:59:10.460 --> 00:59:12.201
People say,
"Oh, this was so unexpected."


1075
00:59:12.288 --> 00:59:15.074
No, this wasn't unexpected.
It was clear as daylight.


1076
00:59:20.427 --> 00:59:22.995
Can't you be
an apocalyptic rationalist?


1077
00:59:23.082 --> 00:59:27.173
I am an apocalyptic
rationalist.


1078
00:59:27.260 --> 00:59:29.349
I'm not an apocalyptic
emotionalist. I'm a rationalist.


1079
00:59:29.436 --> 00:59:30.785
I'm saying,
if we don't make changes,


1080
00:59:30.872 --> 00:59:31.830
we're going
to have an apocalypse.


1081
00:59:31.917 --> 00:59:32.918
Let's make some changes.

1082
00:59:43.189 --> 00:59:46.061
Do you know what
will happen to me


1083
00:59:46.148 --> 00:59:48.063
if the bridge is
not ready in time?


1084
00:59:48.150 --> 00:59:50.022
I haven't the foggiest.

1085
00:59:50.109 --> 00:59:53.025
I'll have to kill myself.

1086
00:59:53.112 --> 00:59:56.202
What would you do
if you were me?


1087
00:59:56.289 --> 00:59:58.465
I suppose, if I were you,

1088
00:59:59.640 --> 01:00:01.468
I'd have to kill myself.

1089
01:00:03.731 --> 01:00:05.124
Cheers.

1090
01:00:09.215 --> 01:00:11.130
It gets back to the concept
of dharma, right?


1091
01:00:11.217 --> 01:00:16.048
It's his, it's his duty,
his destiny, his fate,


1092
01:00:16.135 --> 01:00:18.877
and his obligation,

1093
01:00:18.964 --> 01:00:21.227
he thinks, to get
his men through this.


1094
01:00:21.314 --> 01:00:23.708
I will create

1095
01:00:23.795 --> 01:00:26.754
civilization in the middle
of the horrors of a prison camp


1096
01:00:28.713 --> 01:00:32.151
hundreds of miles
from civilization.


1097
01:00:40.986 --> 01:00:42.596
Walking on the bridge

1098
01:00:42.683 --> 01:00:46.600
on the evening
before it's finished,


1099
01:00:46.687 --> 01:00:48.036
he talks about
his life in India,


1100
01:00:48.123 --> 01:00:50.822
talks about his life
as an officer,


1101
01:00:50.909 --> 01:00:53.476
"What is this all about?"

1102
01:00:53.563 --> 01:00:55.783
He's really talking
about dharma,


1103
01:00:55.870 --> 01:00:58.003
did I accomplish anything,

1104
01:00:58.090 --> 01:01:00.745
did my life have any purpose,
did my life have any meaning?


1105
01:01:00.832 --> 01:01:03.182
His swagger stick falls out
of his hand


1106
01:01:03.269 --> 01:01:06.098
and falls into the River Kwai,

1107
01:01:06.185 --> 01:01:08.622
and he says, "Oh, these are the
thoughts that cloud one's head."


1108
01:01:14.236 --> 01:01:17.022
That's why I find the movies
you've picked so interesting.


1109
01:01:20.025 --> 01:01:21.330
In many of them,

1110
01:01:21.417 --> 01:01:24.333
the hero has
some utter collapse.


1111
01:01:26.118 --> 01:01:28.860
In Twelve O'Clock High,

1112
01:01:28.947 --> 01:01:30.557
Gregory Peck just...

1113
01:01:31.863 --> 01:01:32.994
It breaks him.

1114
01:01:33.081 --> 01:01:34.996
-It breaks him.
-Yeah.


1115
01:01:36.955 --> 01:01:38.696
This is different.

1116
01:01:40.480 --> 01:01:44.963
Alec Guinness,
in his desire to adhere


1117
01:01:45.050 --> 01:01:49.054
to the code
of officer conduct,


1118
01:01:49.141 --> 01:01:53.319
actually loses sight of why
he's there in the first place.


1119
01:01:53.406 --> 01:01:57.149
He realizes that the whole thing
of the properness


1120
01:01:57.236 --> 01:01:58.977
and the Britishness
and the what officers did


1121
01:01:59.064 --> 01:02:00.848
and everything like that,

1122
01:02:00.935 --> 01:02:03.677
it was ultimately to defeat
their enemy, the Japanese,


1123
01:02:03.764 --> 01:02:07.028
and that's why he says,
"What have I done?"


1124
01:02:07.115 --> 01:02:08.595
What have I done?

1125
01:02:09.596 --> 01:02:11.076
And he falls,

1126
01:02:11.163 --> 01:02:13.165
and it's his body that
hits the detonator


1127
01:02:13.252 --> 01:02:15.558
and blows the bridge up.

1128
01:02:25.917 --> 01:02:29.094
Could you imagine yourself
being in a similar position?


1129
01:02:29.181 --> 01:02:30.530
I think anybody could.

1130
01:02:30.617 --> 01:02:33.576
You have to call into question

1131
01:02:33.663 --> 01:02:36.536
and hold yourself
personally accountable,


1132
01:02:36.623 --> 01:02:38.016
or you could end up
like Colonel Nicholson.


1133
01:02:38.103 --> 01:02:39.844
You could realize,

1134
01:02:39.931 --> 01:02:44.196
hey, maybe this
populist-nationalist movement


1135
01:02:44.283 --> 01:02:47.286
is more destructive
than beneficial.


1136
01:03:02.127 --> 01:03:03.781
You have decisions.

1137
01:03:04.956 --> 01:03:06.653
General Savage had decisions

1138
01:03:09.047 --> 01:03:10.875
and Nicholson has decisions.

1139
01:03:16.968 --> 01:03:19.971
In the Judeo
-Christian West,

1140
01:03:20.058 --> 01:03:21.799
we're made in the image
and likeness of God.


1141
01:03:23.409 --> 01:03:25.063
We're fallen.

1142
01:03:30.155 --> 01:03:35.900
I was reading about Lucifer
in Milton's Paradise Lost,


1143
01:03:35.987 --> 01:03:38.990
and I have to say that
Lucifer, for me,


1144
01:03:39.077 --> 01:03:41.688
had certain Bannon-esque
qualities.


1145
01:03:43.603 --> 01:03:46.475
He's the interesting character
in Paradise Lost.


1146
01:03:46.562 --> 01:03:48.521
"Rather reign in Hell"

1147
01:03:48.608 --> 01:03:51.263
"Than serve in Heaven."
Love that line.


1148
01:03:51.350 --> 01:03:52.917
I use it all the time.

1149
01:03:53.004 --> 01:03:54.135
-You do?
-Oh, yeah, all the time.


1150
01:03:54.222 --> 01:03:56.311
There's a lot of truth to that.

1151
01:04:04.711 --> 01:04:09.629
I think it was on
the 28th or 29th of December,


1152
01:04:09.716 --> 01:04:13.459
President Obama put sanctions
on the Russians,


1153
01:04:13.546 --> 01:04:15.461
including this
fairly dramatic


1154
01:04:15.548 --> 01:04:18.464
send 35 people
home to Russia,


1155
01:04:23.991 --> 01:04:25.210
in reaction to interference
in the 2016 campaign.


1156
01:04:32.043 --> 01:04:33.305
I thought it was...

1157
01:04:33.392 --> 01:04:36.830
unusual.

1158
01:04:36.917 --> 01:04:39.659
So all I said was,

1159
01:04:39.746 --> 01:04:43.837
"Let's have Trump see
exactly what Obama saw,


1160
01:04:43.924 --> 01:04:45.970
and let him be briefed
by the same people,


1161
01:04:46.057 --> 01:04:47.319
in the exact same presentation.

1162
01:04:47.406 --> 01:04:50.496
No more, and no less."

1163
01:04:50.583 --> 01:04:51.976
You're the one who asked for it?

1164
01:04:52.063 --> 01:04:54.239
I demanded it.

1165
01:04:54.326 --> 01:04:58.504
You see, to be fair
to Donald Trump,


1166
01:04:58.591 --> 01:05:01.507
let's talk about
the establishment.


1167
01:05:01.594 --> 01:05:05.163
Leave how fucked up
all these guys think he is.


1168
01:05:05.250 --> 01:05:07.992
He's going to be President
of the United States,


1169
01:05:08.079 --> 01:05:10.255
whether you like it or not.

1170
01:05:11.865 --> 01:05:16.217
And you have a responsibility
to this country


1171
01:05:16.304 --> 01:05:18.437
and to its people to make sure

1172
01:05:19.699 --> 01:05:21.570
that it's a smooth transition.

1173
01:05:28.360 --> 01:05:31.711
What was agreed to,
there would be a presentation.


1174
01:05:37.282 --> 01:05:40.459
I got DNI here, I got CIA here,
I got NSA here,


1175
01:05:40.546 --> 01:05:44.028
I got my official staff, right?

1176
01:05:44.115 --> 01:05:45.986
That's a good effect.

1177
01:05:46.073 --> 01:05:49.642
I said, "Come on down.
Let's see that presentation."


1178
01:05:52.862 --> 01:05:55.082
-The way I read it--
-Hang on, hang on, hang on,


1179
01:05:55.169 --> 01:05:58.216
hang on, hang on, hang on.
Now you've got me worked up.


1180
01:05:58.303 --> 01:06:02.394
Now, turns out that Comey,
the head of the FBI,


1181
01:06:02.481 --> 01:06:05.832
had a sidebar package,

1182
01:06:05.919 --> 01:06:09.227
It kind of felt like
either a raw file


1183
01:06:09.314 --> 01:06:11.316
or what's in the very early
stages of a field report.


1184
01:06:16.712 --> 01:06:18.497
And that's what
I get upset about.


1185
01:06:18.584 --> 01:06:22.066
How come it's not an appendix
in the presentation?


1186
01:06:22.153 --> 01:06:23.806
You know why it's
not an appendix?


1187
01:06:26.026 --> 01:06:29.464
Because they were all set
to leak this to the media.


1188
01:06:30.509 --> 01:06:33.512
And surprise, surprise.

1189
01:06:33.599 --> 01:06:35.427
What was it,

1190
01:06:35.514 --> 01:06:38.038
Buzzfeed launched it and then
everybody did a story


1191
01:06:38.125 --> 01:06:41.433
about the story, which is
the easy way out, the cheat.


1192
01:06:41.520 --> 01:06:43.087
Remember, I ran Breitbart.

1193
01:06:43.174 --> 01:06:44.349
I know the game.

1194
01:06:48.135 --> 01:06:51.486
A site like Buzzfeed
got a little looser standards


1195
01:06:51.573 --> 01:06:54.881
than the paper of record.
So they put it up,


1196
01:06:54.968 --> 01:06:57.275
and then the New York Times
does a story about the story


1197
01:06:57.362 --> 01:07:00.104
and links to the whole thing,
and then it's a global story.


1198
01:07:04.586 --> 01:07:07.850
Is that the way
the establishment
is supposed to roll?


1199
01:07:07.937 --> 01:07:09.156
Is that the game
you want to play?


1200
01:07:09.243 --> 01:07:11.637
You want to play that game?

1201
01:07:11.724 --> 01:07:16.729
You don't think our institutions
are rotten at its core?


1202
01:07:16.816 --> 01:07:22.300
Comey said that when Trump was
apprised of the Steele dossier,


1203
01:07:22.387 --> 01:07:25.346
he was just interested
in damage control.


1204
01:07:25.433 --> 01:07:30.917
Right. I think why it's unfair
for Comey to say that,


1205
01:07:31.004 --> 01:07:34.921
you're presenting a guy
that he's paying prostitutes


1206
01:07:35.008 --> 01:07:40.013
in a foreign capital to do
these kind of perverse sex acts,


1207
01:07:40.100 --> 01:07:42.842
so I don't know.

1208
01:07:42.929 --> 01:07:45.714
I was speaking to him
and briefing him


1209
01:07:45.801 --> 01:07:49.370
about some salacious
and unverified material.


1210
01:07:49.457 --> 01:07:52.852
It was in the context of that,

1211
01:07:52.939 --> 01:07:56.247
that he had a strong
and defensive reaction


1212
01:07:56.334 --> 01:07:58.336
about that not being true.

1213
01:07:58.423 --> 01:08:00.164
And my reading of it was,

1214
01:08:00.251 --> 01:08:01.774
it was important for me
to assure him


1215
01:08:01.861 --> 01:08:03.602
we were not personally
investigating him.


1216
01:08:03.689 --> 01:08:07.171
I was very, very much
about being in kind of a


1217
01:08:07.258 --> 01:08:09.216
kind of a J. Edgar Hoover-type
situation.


1218
01:08:09.303 --> 01:08:12.872
I didn't want him thinking
that I was briefing him on this,


1219
01:08:12.959 --> 01:08:15.570
to sort of hang it
over him in some way.


1220
01:08:15.657 --> 01:08:18.182
I was briefing him on it because
we had been told by the media


1221
01:08:18.269 --> 01:08:19.574
it was about to launch.

1222
01:08:19.661 --> 01:08:23.230
And what about the weirdness
of Trump


1223
01:08:23.317 --> 01:08:25.189
saying why he fired Comey

1224
01:08:25.276 --> 01:08:29.802
was because of Comey's handling
of Hillary's emails,


1225
01:08:31.543 --> 01:08:35.764
and then backtracking.

1226
01:08:35.851 --> 01:08:37.549
I wouldn't even
call it backtracking,


1227
01:08:37.636 --> 01:08:40.726
because backtracking
indicates that you know


1228
01:08:40.813 --> 01:08:42.380
that you're backtracking,

1229
01:08:42.467 --> 01:08:45.209
and then just saying,

1230
01:08:45.296 --> 01:08:48.081
"Now I'm going to fire him

1231
01:08:48.168 --> 01:08:50.214
because he's getting obsessed
with Russia."


1232
01:08:51.476 --> 01:08:53.565
Did you ask for
a recommendation?


1233
01:08:53.652 --> 01:08:56.829
What I did is,
I was going to fire Comey.


1234
01:08:56.916 --> 01:08:58.744
My decision.
It was not--


1235
01:08:58.831 --> 01:09:00.093
You had made the decision
before they came in the room?


1236
01:09:00.180 --> 01:09:02.269
I was going to fire Comey.

1237
01:09:02.356 --> 01:09:04.750
There's no good time to do it,
by the way.


1238
01:09:04.837 --> 01:09:06.273
-They--
-Because in your letter
you said,


1239
01:09:06.360 --> 01:09:08.319
"I accepted
their recommendation."


1240
01:09:08.406 --> 01:09:10.103
-Yeah, well they also--
-You had already made
the decision.


1241
01:09:10.190 --> 01:09:12.410
I was going to fire
regardless of recommendation.


1242
01:09:12.497 --> 01:09:15.239
When I decided to just do it,
I said to myself,


1243
01:09:15.326 --> 01:09:17.284
I said, "You know,

1244
01:09:17.371 --> 01:09:21.201
this Russia thing with Trump
and Russia is a made-up story.


1245
01:09:21.288 --> 01:09:24.291
It's an excuse by the Democrats
for having lost an election.


1246
01:09:26.424 --> 01:09:28.774
In the White House,
I'm another schmendrick.


1247
01:09:28.861 --> 01:09:30.776
I'm just an advisor.

1248
01:09:30.863 --> 01:09:34.345
I'm just another voice
around the table.


1249
01:09:34.432 --> 01:09:38.479
I would give the President
my opinion with the bark on.


1250
01:09:38.566 --> 01:09:42.440
I said, "Director Comey
should stay.


1251
01:09:42.527 --> 01:09:44.616
Finish out his investigation."

1252
01:09:44.703 --> 01:09:47.793
Just from a practical point
of view, I saw it decelerating.


1253
01:09:47.880 --> 01:09:49.795
I mean, you could tell
the reporters were tired of it.


1254
01:09:49.882 --> 01:09:52.232
There was no more squeeze
in the lemon.


1255
01:09:52.319 --> 01:09:53.668
It just didn't have the juice.

1256
01:10:00.371 --> 01:10:02.677
Firing Comey doesn't mean
the investigation's gonna stop.


1257
01:10:02.764 --> 01:10:04.201
The FBI's got an investigation.

1258
01:10:06.594 --> 01:10:09.249
And I said, "If you fire him
two things are going to happen,


1259
01:10:09.336 --> 01:10:10.729
as night follows day."

1260
01:10:12.383 --> 01:10:14.733
Within a week,

1261
01:10:14.820 --> 01:10:16.517
they're going
to name a special counsel.


1262
01:10:24.569 --> 01:10:26.745
And the special counsel's gonna
have a writ


1263
01:10:26.832 --> 01:10:28.225
that's going to be so broad--

1264
01:10:30.836 --> 01:10:33.186
You're just not going to fire
the head of the FBI


1265
01:10:33.273 --> 01:10:35.014
doing an investigation,

1266
01:10:35.101 --> 01:10:37.016
and they're just going to sit
there and go, "OK, that's fine."


1267
01:10:37.103 --> 01:10:40.193
The institution of the FBI
is gonna bleed you out...


1268
01:10:40.280 --> 01:10:41.673
because they have to.

1269
01:10:41.760 --> 01:10:44.241
It calls into question...

1270
01:10:44.328 --> 01:10:47.418
the institutions in this country
and the establishment.


1271
01:10:47.505 --> 01:10:49.942
There has been,
from the beginning,


1272
01:10:50.029 --> 01:10:55.426
a nullification project
on the 2016 election.


1273
01:10:55.513 --> 01:10:59.125
And if they can't nullify it,
at least question his legitimacy


1274
01:10:59.212 --> 01:11:00.866
so much that he can't govern.

1275
01:11:00.953 --> 01:11:02.737
People say, "That's the deep
state, it's deep state."


1276
01:11:02.824 --> 01:11:05.262
It's not the deep state.
That's the in-your-face state.


1277
01:11:05.349 --> 01:11:06.698
It's not a deep state.

1278
01:11:06.785 --> 01:11:08.134
It's sitting right there
on the surface.


1279
01:11:17.709 --> 01:11:20.451
Bannon was CEO
of the Trump campaign.


1280
01:11:20.538 --> 01:11:23.758
Now is seen as
one of the most powerful people
in the White House.


1281
01:11:23.845 --> 01:11:27.762
The force behind many of
Trump's early moves, a member of
the National Security Council.


1282
01:11:27.849 --> 01:11:30.417
To be clear, this has
never been done before.


1283
01:11:30.504 --> 01:11:32.071
One of the most
mysterious players


1284
01:11:32.158 --> 01:11:33.855
in the President's
inner circle.


1285
01:11:33.942 --> 01:11:35.466
The puppet
master behind President Trump.


1286
01:11:37.337 --> 01:11:39.557
A reputation as an influential,

1287
01:11:39.644 --> 01:11:41.341
behind-the-scenes string-puller.

1288
01:11:41.428 --> 01:11:42.951
This executive
order has made Bannon


1289
01:11:43.038 --> 01:11:44.736
much more of
a target in Washington.


1290
01:11:44.823 --> 01:11:47.304
His controversial
views on Islam.


1291
01:11:47.391 --> 01:11:49.610
Stirring racial hatred
in the United States.


1292
01:11:49.697 --> 01:11:52.134
Doubling down
on increasing people's fear
and hatred.


1293
01:11:52.221 --> 01:11:54.267
He's a stone-cold racist.

1294
01:11:54.354 --> 01:11:56.661
And his extreme political agenda
remains deeply troubling.


1295
01:11:56.748 --> 01:12:00.317
The most powerful person
in the White House right now,


1296
01:12:00.404 --> 01:12:02.188
including the President.

1297
01:12:05.104 --> 01:12:09.326
Were you the principal author
of the travel ban?


1298
01:12:09.413 --> 01:12:13.678
Stephen Miller
was one of the chief architects


1299
01:12:13.765 --> 01:12:16.028
of many of
the initial executive orders.


1300
01:12:16.115 --> 01:12:17.769
I thought the extreme
vetting executive order,


1301
01:12:17.856 --> 01:12:19.814
which you call the travel ban,

1302
01:12:19.901 --> 01:12:22.600
it's a very pragmatic thing
about extreme vetting.


1303
01:12:22.687 --> 01:12:24.428
Look, it bothered me,

1304
01:12:24.515 --> 01:12:26.691
because I felt
that it was inherently racist.


1305
01:12:28.301 --> 01:12:32.305
And this is
"The Protection of the Nation


1306
01:12:32.392 --> 01:12:36.875
from Foreign Terrorist Entry
into the United States."


1307
01:12:36.962 --> 01:12:38.442
We all know what that means.

1308
01:12:52.325 --> 01:12:55.676
I think the media
completely overplayed that.


1309
01:12:55.763 --> 01:12:59.811
Donald J. Trump is calling for
a total and complete shutdown


1310
01:12:59.898 --> 01:13:02.901
of Muslims entering
the United States,


1311
01:13:02.988 --> 01:13:06.339
until our country's
representatives


1312
01:13:06.426 --> 01:13:09.821
can figure out what
the hell is going on!


1313
01:13:16.610 --> 01:13:17.742
We have no choice.

1314
01:13:18.743 --> 01:13:21.659
We have no choice.

1315
01:13:21.746 --> 01:13:24.662
We did want to hit
on day one


1316
01:13:24.749 --> 01:13:27.882
and just start to really flood
the zone with executive orders.


1317
01:13:27.969 --> 01:13:30.102
It now is the hour of action.

1318
01:13:30.189 --> 01:13:33.279
The media can only handle,
like, one thing at the time.


1319
01:13:33.366 --> 01:13:35.455
If you've given them
five things a day,


1320
01:13:35.542 --> 01:13:38.023
right, three of them
you can kind of get through.


1321
01:13:38.110 --> 01:13:39.938
The idea is they
go into sensory overload?


1322
01:13:40.025 --> 01:13:42.419
Exactly. They do.

1323
01:13:44.290 --> 01:13:47.424
But you had the chaos
at the airports.


1324
01:13:47.511 --> 01:13:50.035
People who have a legitimate
purpose in this country


1325
01:13:50.122 --> 01:13:53.212
being excluded.

1326
01:13:53.299 --> 01:13:57.390
There's a certain kind
of meanness and racism


1327
01:13:57.477 --> 01:13:59.392
at the heart of this.

1328
01:13:59.479 --> 01:14:01.916
You think it's racist?

1329
01:14:02.003 --> 01:14:07.269
I believe that this whole thing
about walls and immigration


1330
01:14:07.356 --> 01:14:09.881
isn't really about
economic populism.


1331
01:14:09.968 --> 01:14:12.405
I think it is about racism.

1332
01:14:12.492 --> 01:14:14.494
Do people really think
that this border wall


1333
01:14:14.581 --> 01:14:17.541
is going to suddenly provide
jobs for them?


1334
01:14:17.628 --> 01:14:19.543
No, I think
they don't like Mexicans


1335
01:14:19.630 --> 01:14:21.980
or they don't like Arabs

1336
01:14:22.067 --> 01:14:23.721
or they don't like Jews.

1337
01:14:41.086 --> 01:14:43.915
Well, let's go to
a distasteful subject,


1338
01:14:44.002 --> 01:14:46.613
Charlottesville.

1339
01:14:46.700 --> 01:14:48.572
It was a weekend
of street battles


1340
01:14:48.659 --> 01:14:50.574
and stark displays
of racism,


1341
01:14:50.661 --> 01:14:54.273
exploding into a deadly act
of domestic terror...


1342
01:14:54.360 --> 01:14:56.362
Hundreds of white nationalists
from across the country


1343
01:14:56.449 --> 01:14:59.104
descended upon the University
of Virginia's campus,


1344
01:14:59.191 --> 01:15:01.106
ahead of a planned demonstration

1345
01:15:01.193 --> 01:15:03.282
to protest the removal
of the statue


1346
01:15:03.369 --> 01:15:05.763
of Confederate General
Robert E. Lee.


1347
01:15:05.850 --> 01:15:08.809
You will not replace us.

1348
01:15:08.896 --> 01:15:12.291
You will not replace us!

1349
01:15:12.378 --> 01:15:15.773
Jews will not replace us!

1350
01:15:15.860 --> 01:15:18.950
You will not replace us!

1351
01:15:19.037 --> 01:15:22.606
Jews will not replace us!

1352
01:15:22.693 --> 01:15:25.696
Jews will not
replace us!


1353
01:15:25.783 --> 01:15:28.960
Jews will not replace us!

1354
01:15:29.047 --> 01:15:32.529
Jews will not
replace us!


1355
01:15:32.616 --> 01:15:35.053
Jews will not replace us!

1356
01:15:35.140 --> 01:15:37.490
Look, reasonable people

1357
01:15:37.577 --> 01:15:40.972
can disagree
about the Confederate monuments.


1358
01:15:41.059 --> 01:15:44.976
The original protests of,
I think we ought to put shrouds


1359
01:15:45.063 --> 01:15:48.153
on the statues of General Lee
or General Jackson


1360
01:15:48.240 --> 01:15:51.243
or remove them,
versus people that say,


1361
01:15:51.330 --> 01:15:53.506
"No, this is part of southern
heritage and southern culture.


1362
01:15:53.593 --> 01:15:56.814
It's not racist,
and they should be honored."


1363
01:15:56.901 --> 01:16:00.992
And guess what, there are decent
on both sides of that argument.


1364
01:16:01.079 --> 01:16:04.561
White lives matter!
White lives matter!


1365
01:16:04.648 --> 01:16:05.997
White lives matter!

1366
01:16:06.084 --> 01:16:08.173
White lives matter!

1367
01:16:08.260 --> 01:16:10.915
White lives matter!
White lives matter!


1368
01:16:20.185 --> 01:16:22.404
Get them off of us!
Get them off of John!


1369
01:16:22.491 --> 01:16:26.713
They're beating the fuck
out of us! Get them off!


1370
01:16:26.800 --> 01:16:29.194
You go down to the next guys,
these neo-Nazis or whatever.


1371
01:16:29.281 --> 01:16:31.544
Those guys,
they have no standing,


1372
01:16:31.631 --> 01:16:33.720
OK, and when they show up
they should be shut down.


1373
01:16:33.807 --> 01:16:36.375
They're bad guys, OK,

1374
01:16:36.462 --> 01:16:41.249
and they're a creation
of the opposition party media.


1375
01:16:41.336 --> 01:16:42.947
They're meaningless
in this Trump movement.


1376
01:16:43.034 --> 01:16:44.252
They're meaningless
in the populist movement.


1377
01:16:44.339 --> 01:16:47.038
They're totally,
completely meaningless.


1378
01:17:01.792 --> 01:17:02.967
Go, go, go, go.

1379
01:17:10.496 --> 01:17:14.892
Did you guys just see that?
A car just plowed through


1380
01:17:14.979 --> 01:17:18.722
hundreds of people,
downtown Charlottesville.


1381
01:17:18.809 --> 01:17:20.941
Holy...

1382
01:17:21.028 --> 01:17:22.421
We need the ambulances.

1383
01:17:33.345 --> 01:17:35.608
It's not conservative media
that's giving them a platform.


1384
01:17:35.695 --> 01:17:37.958
It's the left media.
It's MSNBC


1385
01:17:38.045 --> 01:17:39.960
and Huffington Post,
you've got the left--


1386
01:17:40.047 --> 01:17:42.920
There is something
incredibly perverse


1387
01:17:43.007 --> 01:17:46.184
about saying that neo
-Nazis

1388
01:17:46.271 --> 01:17:48.795
are a creation of
the mainstream media.


1389
01:17:48.882 --> 01:17:50.928
No, because they're a creation
of how big and important


1390
01:17:51.015 --> 01:17:52.103
and how...
a place they have.


1391
01:17:52.190 --> 01:17:53.539
They don't have any place.

1392
01:17:56.020 --> 01:17:58.631
At Breitbart News, Steve Bannon
provided a platform


1393
01:17:58.718 --> 01:18:00.372
for alt-right groups

1394
01:18:00.459 --> 01:18:02.113
who have links
to white supremacists.


1395
01:18:02.200 --> 01:18:05.029
A man who proudly promoted
right-wing nationalism


1396
01:18:05.116 --> 01:18:06.857
inside the White House
and beyond.


1397
01:18:13.211 --> 01:18:14.691
Can you tell us
how you're feeling


1398
01:18:14.778 --> 01:18:16.083
about your chief strategist
Mr. Bannon?


1399
01:18:16.170 --> 01:18:18.129
I never spoke to
Mr. Bannon about it.


1400
01:18:18.216 --> 01:18:21.001
Can you tell us broadly what y-
Do you still have confidence?


1401
01:18:21.088 --> 01:18:22.699
Well, we'll see.
Look, look.


1402
01:18:22.786 --> 01:18:25.049
I like Mr. Bannon.
He's a friend of mine.


1403
01:18:25.136 --> 01:18:27.747
But Mr. Bannon came on
very late. You know that.


1404
01:18:27.834 --> 01:18:31.316
I went through

1405
01:18:31.403 --> 01:18:33.318
and I won all the primaries.

1406
01:18:33.405 --> 01:18:36.190
Mr. Bannon came on
very much later than that.


1407
01:18:36.277 --> 01:18:39.193
And I like him.
He's a good man.


1408
01:18:39.280 --> 01:18:41.718
He is not a racist,
I can tell you that.


1409
01:18:41.805 --> 01:18:44.851
He's a good person. He actually
gets a very unfair press


1410
01:18:44.938 --> 01:18:46.374
in that regard.

1411
01:18:46.461 --> 01:18:49.247
But we'll see what happens
with Mr. Bannon.


1412
01:19:10.834 --> 01:19:13.924
God save thee, my sweet boy!

1413
01:19:15.664 --> 01:19:18.537
Have you your wits?
Know you what 'tis you say?


1414
01:19:18.624 --> 01:19:22.410
My King! My Jove.

1415
01:19:24.108 --> 01:19:26.850
I speak to thee, my heart.

1416
01:19:26.937 --> 01:19:31.115
I know thee not, old man.
Fall to thy prayers.


1417
01:19:35.815 --> 01:19:39.645
How ill white hairs
become a fool and jester.


1418
01:19:41.690 --> 01:19:45.216
I have long dreamed
of such a kind of man.


1419
01:19:45.303 --> 01:19:49.873
So surfeit-swelled, so old,
and so profane.


1420
01:19:49.960 --> 01:19:53.311
But being awaked,
I do despise my dream.


1421
01:19:57.054 --> 01:20:00.753
Presume not
that I am the thing I was.


1422
01:20:00.840 --> 01:20:04.496
For God doth know,
so shall the world perceive,


1423
01:20:04.583 --> 01:20:07.281
that I have turned away
my former self.


1424
01:20:07.368 --> 01:20:09.588
So will I those
that kept me company.


1425
01:20:09.675 --> 01:20:13.505
When thou dost hear I am
as I have been, approach me,


1426
01:20:13.592 --> 01:20:15.072
and thou shalt be
as thou wast,


1427
01:20:15.159 --> 01:20:18.118
the tutor and
the feeder of my riots.


1428
01:20:18.205 --> 01:20:21.861
'Til then, I banish thee
on pain of death,


1429
01:20:21.948 --> 01:20:24.646
as I have done
the rest of my misleaders,


1430
01:20:24.733 --> 01:20:28.302
not to come near our person
by ten miles.


1431
01:20:30.174 --> 01:20:34.613
Falstaff is the very
human element of Henry V.


1432
01:20:34.700 --> 01:20:37.616
He really shows him
what it is to be a full person,


1433
01:20:37.703 --> 01:20:40.314
takes him through
the transition to manhood.


1434
01:20:42.708 --> 01:20:46.320
He's saying,
"I am now the King of England,


1435
01:20:48.018 --> 01:20:49.758
and it's just not
going to work."


1436
01:20:51.717 --> 01:20:55.199
I guess the irony is that
the Trump-Bannon relationship?


1437
01:20:55.286 --> 01:20:57.331
I could see that
in watching it, you know,


1438
01:20:57.418 --> 01:20:58.985
"banished from the kingdom."

1439
01:20:59.072 --> 01:21:02.336
Do you think that
Falstaff was betrayed?


1440
01:21:02.423 --> 01:21:04.948
Not at all. I think if you go
back to Twelve O'Clock High,


1441
01:21:05.035 --> 01:21:06.819
it's his Dharma.

1442
01:21:06.906 --> 01:21:08.212
That's his duty.

1443
01:21:12.390 --> 01:21:15.132
He is now the King of England.
He's not the young man


1444
01:21:15.219 --> 01:21:18.962
who was unformed
when Falstaff met him.


1445
01:21:19.049 --> 01:21:22.487
He understands that Falstaff
can have no role in that.


1446
01:21:22.574 --> 01:21:24.097
I didn't take it personally.

1447
01:21:24.184 --> 01:21:26.012
I think the look on Falstaff's
face at the end


1448
01:21:26.099 --> 01:21:28.841
is projecting that Falstaff
understands that too,


1449
01:21:28.928 --> 01:21:30.060
that this had to happen.

1450
01:21:31.931 --> 01:21:33.672
This is the logical order
of things.


1451
01:21:39.243 --> 01:21:41.723
I would never have
interpreted it that way.


1452
01:21:41.810 --> 01:21:44.596
-How would you interpret it?
-I saw it as a betrayal.


1453
01:21:44.683 --> 01:21:46.032
Why a betrayal?

1454
01:21:46.119 --> 01:21:48.556
Because Falstaff
gave him everything.


1455
01:21:50.297 --> 01:21:51.995
He did give him everything,

1456
01:21:52.082 --> 01:21:55.389
but remember, Sir John Falstaff
knows the entire time


1457
01:21:55.476 --> 01:21:57.870
that this guy is going
to be the King of England.


1458
01:21:57.957 --> 01:22:00.960
It is almost like
he's training Henry V.


1459
01:22:01.047 --> 01:22:02.353
Clearly at the end he thinks
he's going to get,


1460
01:22:02.440 --> 01:22:03.528
as he tells his buddy,

1461
01:22:03.615 --> 01:22:05.530
"I ran the campaign.

1462
01:22:05.617 --> 01:22:08.098
Now I'm gonna be
senior strategist, right?


1463
01:22:08.185 --> 01:22:09.186
I got a special deal."

1464
01:22:11.057 --> 01:22:13.886
And you're told you're not.

1465
01:22:13.973 --> 01:22:18.195
To look at Falstaff at the end,
at least to me,


1466
01:22:18.282 --> 01:22:21.546
he understands
that it's not really a betrayal.


1467
01:22:21.633 --> 01:22:23.461
It's the natural
order of things.


1468
01:22:53.186 --> 01:22:55.797
The film is based upon
the beginnings of the mutiny,


1469
01:22:55.884 --> 01:22:57.190
when the French soldiers said,

1470
01:22:57.277 --> 01:22:58.583
"We're not going
to do this anymore."


1471
01:23:02.326 --> 01:23:03.936
They couldn't take
being treated like animals.


1472
01:23:07.331 --> 01:23:09.289
That's the Deplorables
right there.


1473
01:23:18.690 --> 01:23:21.258
The officers and the politicians

1474
01:23:21.345 --> 01:23:23.608
are all in these chateaus.
They're having balls--


1475
01:23:25.349 --> 01:23:27.003
It's the Deplorables
that are in the trenches,


1476
01:23:29.440 --> 01:23:31.659
living like rats, with rats.

1477
01:23:37.796 --> 01:23:41.191
I'd like to have those guys
in the trenches make decisions.


1478
01:23:41.278 --> 01:23:45.108
But that's the problem, it's
the elites making the decisions.


1479
01:23:45.195 --> 01:23:48.111
Think of all the bad decisions
that have been made on globalism


1480
01:23:48.198 --> 01:23:50.461
by this kind of scientific

1481
01:23:50.548 --> 01:23:53.464
engineering-managerial-
financial elite.


1482
01:23:58.599 --> 01:24:00.079
Look at where the country is.

1483
01:24:00.166 --> 01:24:01.298
Look at where
working class people are.


1484
01:24:01.385 --> 01:24:03.082
Look where the middle class is,

1485
01:24:03.169 --> 01:24:05.650
particularly from
the financial crisis.


1486
01:24:05.737 --> 01:24:07.173
People have been
getting fucked.


1487
01:24:13.919 --> 01:24:15.312
It's as obvious
as the nose on your face.


1488
01:24:15.399 --> 01:24:16.878
We have a consolidation
of power.


1489
01:24:16.965 --> 01:24:18.837
We have a consolidation
of wealth.


1490
01:24:24.756 --> 01:24:26.236
You have to tell
the establishment,


1491
01:24:26.323 --> 01:24:28.368
"Go fuck yourself."

1492
01:24:28.455 --> 01:24:30.066
You just have to.

1493
01:24:33.156 --> 01:24:35.419
I call him
the Fuck You President,


1494
01:24:35.506 --> 01:24:39.031
because all of those people,

1495
01:24:39.118 --> 01:24:41.903
all they've wanted to do
is to say to people,


1496
01:24:41.990 --> 01:24:45.429
"Hey, you, go fuck yourself.
Fuck You."


1497
01:24:46.821 --> 01:24:49.215
He's the Fuck You President.

1498
01:24:49.302 --> 01:24:52.349
You want healthcare?
Fuck you.


1499
01:24:52.436 --> 01:24:56.048
You want clean drinking water?
Fuck you!


1500
01:24:56.135 --> 01:24:57.267
Please.

1501
01:25:01.967 --> 01:25:04.361
What the little guy wants is to
fuck you to the establishment.


1502
01:25:07.451 --> 01:25:09.714
I'm on a mission to try to
remake the Republican Party


1503
01:25:09.801 --> 01:25:11.629
into more of a workers' party.

1504
01:25:11.716 --> 01:25:15.285
And some days we have good days
and more days we have bad days.


1505
01:25:15.372 --> 01:25:19.202
It's not easy, because the money
and the power's on their side.


1506
01:25:19.289 --> 01:25:24.207
But why channel people's hatred
of the Other?


1507
01:25:24.294 --> 01:25:26.600
Your assumption is that
it's something of the Other.


1508
01:25:26.687 --> 01:25:29.212
It is not about the other.

1509
01:25:29.299 --> 01:25:30.474
Everything that
we've been focused on


1510
01:25:30.561 --> 01:25:31.605
is about American citizens.

1511
01:25:31.692 --> 01:25:33.390
This is not about the Other.

1512
01:25:33.477 --> 01:25:37.002
This is about maximizing
the value of your citizenship.


1513
01:25:56.239 --> 01:25:58.937
President Trump's
"economic nationalism"


1514
01:25:59.024 --> 01:26:03.420
does not care about your race,
your religion, your ethnicity,


1515
01:26:03.507 --> 01:26:05.117
or your gender.

1516
01:26:05.204 --> 01:26:07.293
It doesn't care
about your sexual preference.


1517
01:26:09.556 --> 01:26:12.820
It cares about one thing.

1518
01:26:12.907 --> 01:26:15.693
Are you a citizen
of the United States?


1519
01:26:17.869 --> 01:26:21.786
I can tell you one thing
after going all over the world.


1520
01:26:21.873 --> 01:26:24.528
History is on our side.

1521
01:26:38.281 --> 01:26:40.718
The globalists have
no answers to freedom.


1522
01:26:42.894 --> 01:26:44.809
Let them call you racist.

1523
01:26:44.896 --> 01:26:46.637
Let them call you xenophobes.

1524
01:26:48.421 --> 01:26:49.640
Let them call you nativist.

1525
01:26:51.903 --> 01:26:54.166
Wear it as a badge of honor.

1526
01:26:59.389 --> 01:27:02.218
When I walk in,

1527
01:27:02.305 --> 01:27:06.222
eighty or ninety percent of
the audience spits on the floor.


1528
01:27:07.919 --> 01:27:10.182
Because here you have
this racist, nativist,


1529
01:27:10.269 --> 01:27:11.966
really bad guy.

1530
01:27:12.053 --> 01:27:14.012
If not for him Donald Trump
wouldn't be president.


1531
01:27:14.099 --> 01:27:17.494
I hit them with
the exact same punchline,


1532
01:27:17.581 --> 01:27:19.583
which I did with Front National
and in Zurich.


1533
01:27:21.106 --> 01:27:24.065
You may be better fed,
better clothed,


1534
01:27:24.152 --> 01:27:29.723
in better shape
than 18th century Russian serfs,


1535
01:27:29.810 --> 01:27:31.551
but you're nothing but serfs.

1536
01:27:31.638 --> 01:27:33.118
You're not gonna own anything.

1537
01:27:33.205 --> 01:27:35.033
They've got you
in this consumer environment


1538
01:27:35.120 --> 01:27:37.340
where you're always
paying off your credit cards.


1539
01:27:37.427 --> 01:27:39.777
They've destroyed thrifts,
so you can't save anything.


1540
01:27:39.864 --> 01:27:41.605
Saving doesn't make
any difference.


1541
01:27:41.692 --> 01:27:43.215
And then digitally
they've taken all your rights,


1542
01:27:43.302 --> 01:27:45.086
they've taken
all your personhood,


1543
01:27:45.173 --> 01:27:46.740
and they've written these
algorithms that treat you like--


1544
01:27:46.827 --> 01:27:48.264
Like a hamster.

1545
01:27:53.617 --> 01:27:56.141
You're totally controlled,
absolutely, totally controlled.


1546
01:27:59.623 --> 01:28:01.146
I harken back to
Twelve O'Clock High.


1547
01:28:02.800 --> 01:28:04.758
You can't fulfill
your destiny.


1548
01:28:07.152 --> 01:28:10.111
You can't fulfill your dharma.
You can't do it.


1549
01:28:12.984 --> 01:28:15.291
You're nothing but a serf.

1550
01:28:26.737 --> 01:28:28.129
You voted for that,

1551
01:28:31.524 --> 01:28:34.919
You're a reflective,
smart person.


1552
01:28:35.006 --> 01:28:38.314
You actually thought about it
and made a conscious decision.


1553
01:28:38.401 --> 01:28:44.842
Why? "Oh, I fear you. I fear
Trump. I fear--" It's bullshit.


1554
01:28:44.929 --> 01:28:48.846
Just to clarify, my fear is that
Trump represented nothing.


1555
01:28:52.458 --> 01:28:54.678
There's going to be a revolution
in this country.


1556
01:28:54.765 --> 01:28:56.636
It's coming.

1557
01:28:56.723 --> 01:28:59.422
We can't kick the can down
the road like this. We can't.


1558
01:28:59.509 --> 01:29:01.772
We're gonna have another
financial crisis,


1559
01:29:01.859 --> 01:29:04.818
that everybody that's
smart sees is coming.


1560
01:29:11.521 --> 01:29:13.784
What would revolution mean?

1561
01:29:13.871 --> 01:29:16.482
What are we talking about here?

1562
01:29:16.569 --> 01:29:18.354
A complete rejection
of the system.


1563
01:29:26.753 --> 01:29:29.365
It's gonna cut
like a scythe through grass.


1564
01:29:34.457 --> 01:29:35.719
It is coming.
