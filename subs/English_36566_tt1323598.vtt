1
00:00:14.971 --> 00:00:17.997
Yeah, Cheech and Chong!

2
00:00:30.053 --> 00:00:32.146
Cheech and Chong!

3
00:00:45.401 --> 00:00:47.494
Cheech and Chong, yeah!

4
00:00:51.374 --> 00:00:53.001
Welcome to QTV,

5
00:00:53.109 --> 00:00:55.907
I'm your correspondent Doug,
and this is my partner Dougie.


6
00:00:56.012 --> 00:00:56.944
Hello.

7
00:00:57.046 --> 00:00:58.570
How did you get these seats, dude?

8
00:00:58.681 --> 00:01:01.411
Oh, my cousin gave them to me.

9
00:01:01.517 --> 00:01:03.542
Yeah, after I put a
knife up to his throat.

10
00:01:04.854 --> 00:01:08.517
And we're here to critique the costumes
of the Cheech and Chong show.


11
00:01:08.625 --> 00:01:10.149
I like these guys, man.

12
00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:11.727
Yeah, they're funny.

13
00:01:11.828 --> 00:01:14.126
Got all their records.

14
00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:16.289
I stole all their 8-tracks.

15
00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:18.299
All right, all you knuckleheads
in the back drinking,


16
00:01:18.401 --> 00:01:20.164
get your asses back here
and in your seats


17
00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:21.760
so we can get this show going.

18
00:01:28.144 --> 00:01:30.442
Ladies and gentlemen,
your featured act this evening


19
00:01:30.546 --> 00:01:33.037
has appeared on Howard Stern
and Comedy Central.


20
00:01:33.149 --> 00:01:35.743
She's also appeared in
three Cheech and Chong movies.


21
00:01:35.852 --> 00:01:37.649
She's Tommy Chong's favorite co-star.

22
00:01:37.754 --> 00:01:42.987
Please welcome the very funny
and very sexy Shelby Chong.


23
00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:52.693
Oh, hola.

24
00:01:52.802 --> 00:01:55.703
Let's hear it for San Antonio.

25
00:01:55.805 --> 00:01:57.864
A little skinny for me,
but that bitch is hot.


26
00:01:57.974 --> 00:01:59.202
Yeah.

27
00:01:59.309 --> 00:02:01.709
Did everybody get high
to come see Cheech and Chong?


28
00:02:04.113 --> 00:02:05.410
I had a little shitzu like that.

29
00:02:05.515 --> 00:02:07.540
- You're serious.
- Mmm.


30
00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:09.743
Did you guys get high
at home or in the car?


31
00:02:14.023 --> 00:02:16.218
Don't you love pot?

32
00:02:18.227 --> 00:02:20.491
Isn't it the best
thing in the whole world?

33
00:02:23.032 --> 00:02:25.330
I love pot!

34
00:02:25.435 --> 00:02:28.029
It makes everything better.

35
00:02:30.173 --> 00:02:31.765
Food tastes better.

36
00:02:34.043 --> 00:02:37.740
Tommy thinks I'm a fabulous cook.

37
00:02:37.847 --> 00:02:41.214
Sex is better.

38
00:02:43.453 --> 00:02:45.478
Hey, this is cool out here, man.

39
00:02:45.588 --> 00:02:47.920
Hey, all right.

40
00:02:48.024 --> 00:02:50.584
Yeah, this is nice.

41
00:02:50.693 --> 00:02:52.160
Fucking cold, man.

42
00:02:52.261 --> 00:02:54.661
Do you guys know what
smoking pot is good for?


43
00:02:54.764 --> 00:02:57.494
Everything!

44
00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:59.693
Well, it's good
for when you're PMSing.


45
00:02:59.802 --> 00:03:04.432
When I'm PMSing,
Tommy smokes a ton of pot.


46
00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:05.632
Hey, well, light it up, man.

47
00:03:05.742 --> 00:03:06.640
Light what up?

48
00:03:06.743 --> 00:03:08.768
The joint, come on.

49
00:03:08.878 --> 00:03:09.776
I don't have a joint.

50
00:03:09.879 --> 00:03:10.777
What?

51
00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:11.972
You invited me out here, man.

52
00:03:12.081 --> 00:03:13.708
But I don't--

53
00:03:13.816 --> 00:03:15.511
Stupid.

54
00:03:15.618 --> 00:03:16.516
Hey, Shelby's kicking ass.

55
00:03:16.619 --> 00:03:17.608
Yeah, she's doing good.

56
00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:19.415
And when we first met Cheech,

57
00:03:19.522 --> 00:03:21.922
we didn't even know
what a Mexican was then.


58
00:03:22.024 --> 00:03:25.084
And then Tommy figured it out.

59
00:03:25.194 --> 00:03:29.961
He said, "Shelby, it's like
an Indian without a casino."


60
00:03:30.066 --> 00:03:32.125
I got a roach. Ha ha! 
I have a roach.

61
00:03:32.235 --> 00:03:34.169
Hey, the roach will do.

62
00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:35.362
Oh, shit, it's starting to rain.

63
00:03:35.471 --> 00:03:36.369
Here.

64
00:03:36.472 --> 00:03:37.666
Here, put this on your head.

65
00:03:37.774 --> 00:03:40.709
It'll keep you dry--
hat dry for the show.

66
00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:42.903
Oh, okay.

67
00:03:43.012 --> 00:03:43.910
What a good idea.

68
00:03:44.013 --> 00:03:44.911
All right, light it up.

69
00:03:45.014 --> 00:03:48.347
- I don't have a match.
- What?


70
00:03:48.451 --> 00:03:50.942
I got no--

71
00:03:51.053 --> 00:03:52.748
Fuck, it's cold.
We got to go. Come on.


72
00:03:52.855 --> 00:03:57.690
We don't have time. Let's go.

73
00:03:57.794 --> 00:04:03.255
Fuck Bush for putting Tommy Chong
in jail for selling a bong.


74
00:04:03.366 --> 00:04:05.960
- Yeah.

75
00:04:06.068 --> 00:04:07.626
I'm so glad we're rid of him.

76
00:04:07.737 --> 00:04:08.635
There's no door handle.

77
00:04:08.738 --> 00:04:09.636
What? Well, open it.

78
00:04:09.739 --> 00:04:11.832
It's not opening.

79
00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:16.538
Hey, hello.

80
00:04:16.646 --> 00:04:19.137
And I woke up.
My head was banging.


81
00:04:19.248 --> 00:04:21.648
Then I realized it was someone
banging at the door.


82
00:04:21.751 --> 00:04:22.911
Hey!

83
00:04:23.019 --> 00:04:24.179
I can't hear when
you're fucking banging.


84
00:04:24.287 --> 00:04:25.276
Hold on.

85
00:04:25.388 --> 00:04:27.856
And there's, like,
ten cops standing there.


86
00:04:27.957 --> 00:04:29.652
They got their rifles out
and their helmets on.


87
00:04:29.759 --> 00:04:32.159
They're, like, banging,
banging at the door.


88
00:04:32.261 --> 00:04:34.661
Finally, Tommy opened up
the door and goes,


89
00:04:34.764 --> 00:04:37.756
"Hey, man, Dave's not here."

90
00:04:37.867 --> 00:04:39.357
We got to go. We got to go.

91
00:04:39.469 --> 00:04:41.300
- There's a thing.
- Oh, that looks dangerous, man.


92
00:04:41.404 --> 00:04:42.302
Well, you go first.

93
00:04:42.405 --> 00:04:43.565
Why me?

94
00:04:43.673 --> 00:04:44.970
Because you go on first. Come on.

95
00:04:45.074 --> 00:04:45.972
Let's go.

96
00:04:46.075 --> 00:04:47.440
Well, how-- how do you do this?

97
00:04:47.543 --> 00:04:50.307
It's weighted.
You just got to go to the end.


98
00:04:50.413 --> 00:04:53.246
Hey, any you guys seen
my guys around anywhere?


99
00:04:55.251 --> 00:04:56.513
Oh, shit.

100
00:04:56.619 --> 00:04:58.416
I'm getting close here, you know?

101
00:04:58.521 --> 00:05:01.718
And I really am getting
a little bit nervous.


102
00:05:01.824 --> 00:05:02.756
Shit.

103
00:05:02.859 --> 00:05:04.156
Come on, we got to go, man.

104
00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:06.490
Shelby must be off by now.

105
00:05:06.596 --> 00:05:09.565
If you guys are gonna start
a glass business or a bong business,


106
00:05:09.665 --> 00:05:12.156
don't put your face on the bong.

107
00:05:15.037 --> 00:05:15.935
That doesn't look stable at all.

108
00:05:16.038 --> 00:05:17.938
Wait, whoa.

109
00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:19.337
And then the cop comes up and goes,

110
00:05:19.442 --> 00:05:22.377
"Mr. Chong, have you got
any marijuana in here?"


111
00:05:22.478 --> 00:05:26.039
"Of course I do. 
I'm Tommy Chong."

112
00:05:29.118 --> 00:05:32.884
And the judge sentenced Tommy
to nine months in jail.


113
00:05:32.989 --> 00:05:34.149
See you, sucker.

114
00:05:34.257 --> 00:05:35.383
I'm sitting there thinking,

115
00:05:35.491 --> 00:05:39.291
"Wow, I fucked up.
I should've married Cheech."


116
00:05:39.395 --> 00:05:42.887
But thank God for conjugal visits.

117
00:05:42.999 --> 00:05:45.968
If Cheech didn't visit me once a week--

118
00:05:46.068 --> 00:05:47.660
Fuck off, man. 
Don't piss around.

119
00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:51.501
I wouldn't have fucked anybody.

120
00:05:54.377 --> 00:05:55.366
Hey, hello.

121
00:05:55.478 --> 00:05:57.139
Jesus Christ.

122
00:05:57.246 --> 00:05:58.736
Fuck! God damn it.

123
00:05:58.848 --> 00:06:02.147
Thank you very much.
That's my time.


124
00:06:02.251 --> 00:06:04.583
Now for the stars of the show.

125
00:06:04.687 --> 00:06:06.917
Through those doors.

126
00:06:07.023 --> 00:06:10.424
The Maharishi of Marijuana!

127
00:06:10.526 --> 00:06:12.255
- Excuse me.
- Hey, back up.


128
00:06:12.361 --> 00:06:13.692
Hold on. Hold on.

129
00:06:13.796 --> 00:06:15.388
We're Cheech and Chong.

130
00:06:15.498 --> 00:06:16.829
Join the other Cheech and Chongs.

131
00:06:16.933 --> 00:06:18.093
Get in the back of the line.

132
00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:20.168
We're Cheech and Chong.
This is Cheech.


133
00:06:21.671 --> 00:06:23.605
The Pope of dope.

134
00:06:23.706 --> 00:06:25.970
Why don't you get in line
like everybody else?


135
00:06:26.075 --> 00:06:28.566
Cheech and Chong!

136
00:06:28.678 --> 00:06:30.043
Shit.

137
00:06:32.682 --> 00:06:33.671
Hey, guys. Come on, man.

138
00:06:33.783 --> 00:06:35.717
She's about to go off.

139
00:06:35.818 --> 00:06:37.718
- What are you doing, man?
- How come the doors are locked?


140
00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:39.287
Tommy is right in back of me.

141
00:07:01.777 --> 00:07:03.472
Which one is that, 
Ching or Chang?

142
00:07:06.716 --> 00:07:08.411
He gained a little
bit of weight, didn't he?

143
00:07:08.517 --> 00:07:09.882
A little weight, yes, he did.

144
00:07:11.921 --> 00:07:13.582
He's giving those suspenders a workout.

145
00:07:24.066 --> 00:07:26.296
You're Tommy?
Can I have your autograph?


146
00:07:26.402 --> 00:07:28.370
Chinga, chinga, chinga, chinga,

147
00:07:28.471 --> 00:07:29.836
chinga, chinga, chinga, chinga.

148
00:07:29.939 --> 00:07:32.134
Chinga, chinga, chinga--

149
00:07:32.241 --> 00:07:35.699
Cabrón, cabrón, cabrón, cabrón.

150
00:07:35.811 --> 00:07:38.006
Puta, puta, puta, puta, puta, puta.

151
00:07:38.114 --> 00:07:41.743
Hey, I'm just a love machine

152
00:07:41.851 --> 00:07:44.046
And I don't work
for nobody but you


153
00:07:44.153 --> 00:07:46.314
Ooo, hey.

154
00:07:46.422 --> 00:07:50.222
San Anton', baby, what's up, huh?

155
00:07:50.326 --> 00:07:52.021
Hey, mami, want a ride?

156
00:07:53.129 --> 00:07:54.061
Come on over.

157
00:07:54.163 --> 00:07:56.188
I'll clear a place
for you to sit down.

158
00:07:56.298 --> 00:07:57.458
Yeah, right there, honey.

159
00:08:01.837 --> 00:08:03.270
Fuck you, stuck-up bitch.

160
00:08:03.372 --> 00:08:04.703
Man, shit.

161
00:08:04.807 --> 00:08:07.867
I'm just a love machine

162
00:08:07.977 --> 00:08:09.069
And I don't work

163
00:08:09.178 --> 00:08:11.408
Ooh, look at that kid's hitchhiking.

164
00:08:11.514 --> 00:08:12.412
Hey, hey, baby.

165
00:08:12.515 --> 00:08:14.210
You, come on, you want a ride?

166
00:08:14.316 --> 00:08:15.806
Yeah, bend over.
I'll drive you home, honey.


167
00:08:17.019 --> 00:08:18.384
And pick him up. Pick him up.

168
00:08:20.389 --> 00:08:21.651
Oh, here comes the other one.

169
00:08:23.025 --> 00:08:24.583
This is his grandfather, I think.

170
00:08:43.079 --> 00:08:45.946
Hey, you ain't a chick, man.

171
00:08:46.048 --> 00:08:48.243
Yeah, I know, man.

172
00:08:48.350 --> 00:08:51.251
Hey, it's the only way
I can get a ride, man.


173
00:08:51.353 --> 00:08:54.914
I've been hitchhiking
out there for hours, man.


174
00:08:55.024 --> 00:08:56.958
I almost froze my balls off.

175
00:08:57.059 --> 00:09:00.256
I didn't think you had any.
That's why I stopped, man.


176
00:09:00.362 --> 00:09:01.727
Shit.

177
00:09:01.831 --> 00:09:04.197
Wow, I like your car, man.

178
00:09:04.300 --> 00:09:06.359
Oh, you do?

179
00:09:06.469 --> 00:09:07.902
Are these dingle balls?

180
00:09:08.003 --> 00:09:11.268
Yeah, yeah, old school, dude.

181
00:09:11.373 --> 00:09:15.002
I got them at oldschool.com.

182
00:09:15.111 --> 00:09:17.102
And what's on the headliner, man?

183
00:09:17.213 --> 00:09:19.647
That's shag carpet, man.

184
00:09:19.749 --> 00:09:21.239
Yeah.

185
00:09:21.350 --> 00:09:24.376
Yeah, I got the last 2 yards
of pink shag they had, man.


186
00:09:24.487 --> 00:09:26.148
It's just I put it everywhere, dude.

187
00:09:26.255 --> 00:09:30.123
I put it on the headliner,
on the dashboard, on the floor, man.


188
00:09:30.226 --> 00:09:31.716
I even put it in the ashtrays, man.

189
00:09:33.095 --> 00:09:34.858
It's like being inside a giant pussy.

190
00:09:39.602 --> 00:09:42.093
Yeah, I never thought
of it like that, man.


191
00:09:42.204 --> 00:09:44.069
God damn, I feel like
a tampon now, man.


192
00:09:47.243 --> 00:09:48.608
Uptight and out of sight.

193
00:09:50.546 --> 00:09:51.740
You know what's weird?

194
00:09:51.847 --> 00:09:52.745
What?

195
00:09:52.848 --> 00:09:54.042
You look like a tampon, man.

196
00:09:54.150 --> 00:09:55.549
Do l? Oh.

197
00:09:55.651 --> 00:09:58.882
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

198
00:09:58.988 --> 00:10:00.080
And you know what's really cool?

199
00:10:00.189 --> 00:10:03.283
This car smells like a pussy, man.

200
00:10:03.392 --> 00:10:05.690
Yeah, expensive, man.

201
00:10:07.129 --> 00:10:08.562
No, fishy.

202
00:10:08.664 --> 00:10:10.291
Oh, no, no, that's me.

203
00:10:10.399 --> 00:10:11.491
I work at Red Lobster, man.

204
00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:12.794
Oh.

205
00:10:12.902 --> 00:10:15.700
Hey, what do you got
under the hood, man?


206
00:10:15.805 --> 00:10:16.737
Anything special?

207
00:10:16.839 --> 00:10:18.397
Oh, you want to find out, man?

208
00:10:18.507 --> 00:10:19.633
Here we go.

209
00:10:38.494 --> 00:10:40.189
Hey, how far you going, man?

210
00:10:40.296 --> 00:10:42.992
The end of the block is fine, man.

211
00:10:43.199 --> 00:10:46.657
Here we are at the live
Cheech and Chong Light Up America Show.


212
00:10:46.769 --> 00:10:49.704
And look who we have here.
Sister Mary Elephant.


213
00:10:49.805 --> 00:10:52.899
Hey, ese, you ain't afraid
of a little speed are you, man?


214
00:10:53.008 --> 00:10:55.272
You got speed, man?

215
00:10:55.377 --> 00:10:58.073
Oh, no, you know what?
I had a bunch of speed last night, man.


216
00:10:58.180 --> 00:10:59.545
But I had to take it

217
00:10:59.648 --> 00:11:02.412
because I had to cram for my urine test
this morning, man.


218
00:11:02.518 --> 00:11:04.884
Hey, but you know
what I do got, man?

219
00:11:04.987 --> 00:11:07.615
I got a joint, man.

220
00:11:09.525 --> 00:11:13.791
I taught Cheech in grade school
from grade 1 to 8.


221
00:11:13.896 --> 00:11:14.828
I can't believe it.

222
00:11:14.930 --> 00:11:16.295
And what kind of a student was he?

223
00:11:16.398 --> 00:11:20.129
Well, he was very squirrelly
until we got him on those pills,


224
00:11:20.236 --> 00:11:21.567
and then he calmed down quite a bit.

225
00:11:21.670 --> 00:11:26.437
Come on, light it up
and let's get Chinese eyes, man.


226
00:11:26.542 --> 00:11:29.010
Looks like a toothpick, man.

227
00:11:29.111 --> 00:11:30.601
No, no, it's just rolled real tight, man.

228
00:11:30.713 --> 00:11:31.611
Tight, tight.

229
00:11:31.714 --> 00:11:33.579
No, it's a toothpick.

230
00:11:33.682 --> 00:11:35.206
It's not a--

231
00:11:35.317 --> 00:11:38.150
Fuck, it's a toothpick.

232
00:11:38.254 --> 00:11:40.051
What do you think of marijuana?

233
00:11:40.155 --> 00:11:42.419
Oh, I didn't teach her.

234
00:11:42.524 --> 00:11:44.321
Must've got the wrong pocket, man.

235
00:11:44.426 --> 00:11:47.589
I got it over in
the secret stash over here.


236
00:11:47.696 --> 00:11:49.926
No, that's my dick.

237
00:11:50.032 --> 00:11:51.499
Ouch.

238
00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:52.498
No, here, here.

239
00:11:52.601 --> 00:11:53.499
Here's the other one, man.

240
00:11:53.602 --> 00:11:56.196
Light that puppy up, man.

241
00:11:56.305 --> 00:11:58.500
Geez, I hope your dick's
bigger than this, man.


242
00:12:01.477 --> 00:12:03.570
You want to walk, man? Shit, fuck.

243
00:12:03.679 --> 00:12:04.976
You're here to see Cheech and Chong?

244
00:12:05.080 --> 00:12:07.048
Well, yes, because Dave's not here.

245
00:12:07.149 --> 00:12:08.275
I don't know what that means.

246
00:12:08.384 --> 00:12:09.282
Oh, my goodness.

247
00:12:09.385 --> 00:12:10.283
But I have the T-shirt.

248
00:12:10.386 --> 00:12:11.284
Please, boys and girls.

249
00:12:11.387 --> 00:12:13.446
Please, could you bring it down?

250
00:12:13.555 --> 00:12:16.285
You know, I wouldn't
feel right smoking this little guy.


251
00:12:16.392 --> 00:12:17.290
What?

252
00:12:17.393 --> 00:12:18.291
Give it back, man.

253
00:12:18.394 --> 00:12:22.228
You keep it. I got a joint I've been
carrying around with me for a while.


254
00:12:22.331 --> 00:12:23.389
Oh, that's cool.

255
00:12:23.499 --> 00:12:26.798
Boys and girls. 
Boys and girls.

256
00:12:26.902 --> 00:12:28.631
Shut up!

257
00:12:37.713 --> 00:12:40.409
It looks like a number 3 burrito, man.

258
00:12:40.516 --> 00:12:43.280
All right, fuck, yeah, man. Shit, man.

259
00:12:44.753 --> 00:12:47.085
Yeah, man, this tastes--

260
00:12:47.189 --> 00:12:49.987
Fuck.

261
00:12:50.092 --> 00:12:52.458
Is he supposed to be smoking a joint?

262
00:12:52.561 --> 00:12:55.826
Uh, I don't know.
I can't see that far, man.


263
00:12:55.931 --> 00:12:58.525
Kind of grabs you
by the poo-poo, don't it?


264
00:13:00.469 --> 00:13:01.959
Hey, smoke a real one, man.

265
00:13:03.572 --> 00:13:05.005
Tastes weird, man.

266
00:13:05.107 --> 00:13:07.598
Oh, that's the K
-Y jelly, man.

267
00:13:07.710 --> 00:13:08.904
What?

268
00:13:09.011 --> 00:13:11.639
Yeah, I got a friend in jail, man.

269
00:13:11.747 --> 00:13:15.308
And he wanted me to smuggle some dope
in for him, you know?


270
00:13:15.417 --> 00:13:18.944
So I smuggled it in,
but I forgot I had it, man.


271
00:13:21.223 --> 00:13:24.317
So I smuggled it back out, man.

272
00:13:24.426 --> 00:13:26.155
I thought that was
peanut butter on there, man.


273
00:13:26.261 --> 00:13:27.228
Fuck.

274
00:13:32.234 --> 00:13:33.531
Eh, fuck it.

275
00:13:37.639 --> 00:13:40.005
I kind of like the K
-Y jelly

276
00:13:40.109 --> 00:13:43.169
because that way your lips
don't stick to the paper.


277
00:13:46.515 --> 00:13:49.780
But you only need a little bit, man,
because this shit will tear you up.


278
00:13:51.353 --> 00:13:56.416
God damn, man, 
I can't feel my lips.

279
00:13:56.525 --> 00:13:59.119
Oh, that's the Preparation H, man.

280
00:13:59.228 --> 00:14:02.891
Am I driving okay, man?

281
00:14:02.998 --> 00:14:05.967
I think we're parked, man.

282
00:14:10.873 --> 00:14:12.864
Am I parked okay?

283
00:14:12.975 --> 00:14:16.376
Well, we're stopped
in the middle of the road, man.


284
00:14:16.478 --> 00:14:19.072
Fuck, my heart is beating
really fast, man.


285
00:14:19.181 --> 00:14:20.113
I can't breathe, man.

286
00:14:20.215 --> 00:14:21.147
Whoa, hey, hey.

287
00:14:21.250 --> 00:14:22.740
- Hold on, man.
- I'm gonna pass out, man.


288
00:14:22.851 --> 00:14:25.979
Here. I got something that'll
take the edge off, man.


289
00:14:26.088 --> 00:14:28.079
Here, just take
a couple of these, man.


290
00:14:28.190 --> 00:14:29.088
Okay.

291
00:14:29.191 --> 00:14:30.089
Oh, wait, hey.

292
00:14:30.192 --> 00:14:32.626
Don't take those, man.

293
00:14:33.762 --> 00:14:34.888
What? What?

294
00:14:34.997 --> 00:14:39.957
Fuck, man.
I almost gave you the wrong shit.


295
00:14:40.069 --> 00:14:41.263
I already took them, man.

296
00:14:41.370 --> 00:14:43.065
Oh!

297
00:14:43.172 --> 00:14:44.503
What?

298
00:14:44.606 --> 00:14:46.471
Oh, man.

299
00:14:46.575 --> 00:14:48.475
What was in that shit, man?

300
00:14:48.577 --> 00:14:50.568
You just ate all my acid, man.

301
00:14:50.679 --> 00:14:53.273
What?

302
00:14:53.382 --> 00:14:55.247
There's at least 10,000 hits on that.

303
00:14:55.350 --> 00:14:56.715
What?

304
00:14:56.819 --> 00:14:59.185
I never had no acid before, man.

305
00:15:03.725 --> 00:15:07.058
I'm sorry. I don't mean to laugh, man.

306
00:15:07.162 --> 00:15:08.959
But I hope you're not
busy for about a year.

307
00:15:09.064 --> 00:15:11.191
Oh, my head is going to explode, man.

308
00:15:11.300 --> 00:15:13.928
God damn, I see those guys
around my neighborhood had too many acids.


309
00:15:14.036 --> 00:15:15.526
No, no, no, man.

310
00:15:15.637 --> 00:15:16.535
Mellow out, man.

311
00:15:16.638 --> 00:15:17.935
Come on, ohm. Ohm with me.

312
00:15:18.040 --> 00:15:20.770
Ohm...

313
00:15:20.876 --> 00:15:23.276
- Ohm...
- Ohm...


314
00:15:27.616 --> 00:15:30.176
There. You mellow?

315
00:15:30.285 --> 00:15:32.719
Yeah.

316
00:15:32.821 --> 00:15:34.482
Feels good, don't it, man?

317
00:15:34.590 --> 00:15:35.818
Yeah.

318
00:15:35.924 --> 00:15:36.982
Blah!

319
00:15:43.298 --> 00:15:45.664
Hey, are farts supposed
to be lumpy, man?


320
00:15:49.705 --> 00:15:51.935
I'm on fucking acid, yeah.

321
00:15:52.040 --> 00:15:53.564
Fuck, man. Hey.

322
00:15:53.675 --> 00:15:57.008
The cops pulled up behind us.

323
00:15:57.112 --> 00:15:58.010
The cops are be--

324
00:15:58.113 --> 00:16:00.172
Just be cool. Be cool.

325
00:16:00.282 --> 00:16:01.749
- Hey, we're on acid!
- Fuck, man.


326
00:16:06.788 --> 00:16:08.346
Haa!

327
00:16:12.060 --> 00:16:13.220
What?

328
00:16:13.328 --> 00:16:15.319
Where's my license?

329
00:16:15.430 --> 00:16:17.830
It's on the bumper back there.

330
00:16:20.068 --> 00:16:21.933
Oh, I got my drive--

331
00:16:25.974 --> 00:16:28.135
I thought of something really funny.

332
00:16:28.243 --> 00:16:29.141
Your mama.

333
00:16:31.780 --> 00:16:35.238
What? What's my name?

334
00:16:35.350 --> 00:16:37.511
Oh, fuck.

335
00:16:37.619 --> 00:16:39.951
Isn't it on there on the license, man?

336
00:16:40.055 --> 00:16:42.489
What's his? I don't know.

337
00:16:42.591 --> 00:16:44.456
I picked him up--
All right, all right.


338
00:16:44.560 --> 00:16:45.788
Fuck, dude. Chill.

339
00:16:45.894 --> 00:16:47.794
Hey, man, the dude wants
to know your name, man.


340
00:16:47.896 --> 00:16:48.794
Tell the dude your name.

341
00:16:51.200 --> 00:16:54.101
Uh, his name is Ralph, man.

342
00:16:54.269 --> 00:16:56.203
Go. Out.
Everybody out. Everybody out.


343
00:16:56.305 --> 00:16:58.068
- Stand by to restore.

344
00:17:01.510 --> 00:17:03.102
Restore, go, in the center.
Get Tommy.


345
00:17:03.212 --> 00:17:05.772
There you go.
Both spots on Tommy. That's it.


346
00:17:05.881 --> 00:17:07.371
Thank you.

347
00:17:07.482 --> 00:17:09.609
Thank you.

348
00:17:11.053 --> 00:17:14.045
Thank you. Thank you.

349
00:17:20.729 --> 00:17:21.718
Thank you, my children.

350
00:17:21.830 --> 00:17:24.230
Bless you. Bless you. Bless you.

351
00:17:24.333 --> 00:17:26.995
Well, our long nightmare is finally over.

352
00:17:27.102 --> 00:17:29.468
Cheech and Chong
are back together again.


353
00:17:30.572 --> 00:17:32.563
Yes, yes.

354
00:17:32.674 --> 00:17:36.576
Whoa, Cheech and Chong
back together, yeah.


355
00:17:36.678 --> 00:17:39.579
How exciting is it being
at the Cheech and Chong show?


356
00:17:39.681 --> 00:17:40.613
Isn't this great?

357
00:17:40.716 --> 00:17:42.479
I'm plotzing here.

358
00:17:42.584 --> 00:17:44.575
No one's happier than l,
I'll tell you, man.


359
00:17:44.686 --> 00:17:46.586
Because I was tired
of hanging out at Home Depot.


360
00:17:46.688 --> 00:17:50.089
You know?

361
00:17:50.192 --> 00:17:52.160
Really, I'd look over the guys,
and if I found one


362
00:17:52.261 --> 00:17:54.320
that looked like Cheech I'd hire him.

363
00:17:54.429 --> 00:17:56.397
He get in the car
and he'd go "¿Trabajo?"


364
00:17:56.498 --> 00:17:57.795
I'd go, "No, smoko."

365
00:17:57.899 --> 00:17:59.264
There you go.

366
00:17:59.368 --> 00:18:00.596
It's sort of a bummer, though,

367
00:18:00.702 --> 00:18:04.001
that you guys didn't
get to be in the show.


368
00:18:04.106 --> 00:18:05.767
Well, we-
- They asked.

369
00:18:05.874 --> 00:18:08.308
Our agent really screwed everything up.

370
00:18:08.410 --> 00:18:09.900
He thought we were busy.
We weren't busy.


371
00:18:10.012 --> 00:18:10.910
And we weren't busy.

372
00:18:11.013 --> 00:18:12.446
Of course you weren't busy.

373
00:18:12.547 --> 00:18:13.844
Who would want to hire you guys?

374
00:18:13.949 --> 00:18:16.213
We were busy, but not that busy.

375
00:18:16.318 --> 00:18:17.808
Not that we couldn't
drop everything


376
00:18:17.919 --> 00:18:18.817
to do Cheech and Chong.

377
00:18:18.920 --> 00:18:20.148
We'd do them in a second.

378
00:18:20.255 --> 00:18:22.815
The truth is we broke up
because we got rich.


379
00:18:22.924 --> 00:18:26.018
And you can't make
a rich Mexican do shit, boy.


380
00:18:32.234 --> 00:18:33.496
Yeah!

381
00:18:33.602 --> 00:18:35.661
Over the years I'd say,
"Cheech, we got to work."


382
00:18:35.771 --> 00:18:39.639
He'd go,
"l don't think so, man.


383
00:18:39.741 --> 00:18:41.174
"You go ahead, ese. I'm gonna--

384
00:18:41.276 --> 00:18:44.439
"I'm gonna stay here
and do something for my people.


385
00:18:44.546 --> 00:18:46.844
"Yeah, I'm going to learn Spanish."

386
00:18:49.051 --> 00:18:50.575
Hey, I'm learning Spanish.

387
00:18:50.686 --> 00:18:54.053
I know my Mexican name--
pendejo.


388
00:18:56.858 --> 00:19:01.352
Yes, it means
"my very good friend," right?


389
00:19:01.463 --> 00:19:02.487
Yes.

390
00:19:02.597 --> 00:19:04.565
But when we got together,

391
00:19:04.666 --> 00:19:06.065
the only problem we had
was what to do.


392
00:19:06.168 --> 00:19:07.658
Because we hadn't been
together for a long time.


393
00:19:07.769 --> 00:19:09.236
So what we did, we got on YouTube.

394
00:19:09.338 --> 00:19:12.273
And the one bit that really stuck out
is the one we're gonna do now.


395
00:19:12.441 --> 00:19:14.375
It's called
"Let's Make A Dope Deal,"


396
00:19:14.476 --> 00:19:15.943
and here's your host,

397
00:19:16.044 --> 00:19:17.875
Wayne Dickerson.

398
00:19:17.979 --> 00:19:18.877
Let's make a dope deal.

399
00:19:18.980 --> 00:19:21.244
I don't got nothing on me.

400
00:19:21.350 --> 00:19:22.749
Hey.

401
00:19:22.851 --> 00:19:24.751
Hey, peace on you.

402
00:19:24.853 --> 00:19:26.980
Peace on you. Peace on you.
Peace on you.


403
00:19:27.089 --> 00:19:31.423
Hey, Jimmy, the idiots in the balcony
are throwing shit, okay?


404
00:19:31.526 --> 00:19:32.458
Shit.

405
00:19:32.561 --> 00:19:34.256
- It's joints, but still.
- Okay.


406
00:19:34.363 --> 00:19:36.661
Play America's favorite
daytime buzz show,


407
00:19:36.765 --> 00:19:38.733
Let's Make A Dope Deal.

408
00:19:38.834 --> 00:19:40.233
Are you ready to play?

409
00:19:40.335 --> 00:19:43.031
I don't know if blue
is the best jacket for him.


410
00:19:43.138 --> 00:19:45.629
All right, is everybody ready?
Are they toked up?


411
00:19:45.741 --> 00:19:48.471
I wonder who he blew.

412
00:19:48.577 --> 00:19:49.703
So let's not waste any more time.

413
00:19:49.811 --> 00:19:51.039
Let's bring up our first contestant.

414
00:19:51.146 --> 00:19:53.944
Let's have a big warm welcome
for Bob Mitchell!


415
00:19:54.049 --> 00:19:56.244
Yeah! Whoo!

416
00:20:09.364 --> 00:20:10.695
Yeah!

417
00:20:10.799 --> 00:20:11.891
Nothing's sadder than an old hippie.

418
00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:13.024
Mmm.

419
00:20:13.135 --> 00:20:14.067
How you doing, Bob?

420
00:20:14.169 --> 00:20:16.569
Uh, bitchen, man.

421
00:20:16.671 --> 00:20:18.332
He's bitchen. Well, you look bitchen.

422
00:20:18.440 --> 00:20:19.566
This is for you, man.

423
00:20:19.674 --> 00:20:22.404
Oh, thank you, man.
You smell bitchen, too.


424
00:20:22.511 --> 00:20:25.378
Now, I understand, Bob,
that you're the head


425
00:20:25.480 --> 00:20:28.916
of the experimental chemistry department
at Texas A&M University.


426
00:20:29.017 --> 00:20:29.915
Yes, I am, man.

427
00:20:30.018 --> 00:20:30.916
Wow.

428
00:20:31.019 --> 00:20:32.919
Longhorns!

429
00:20:33.021 --> 00:20:33.919
That is-
- That is--

430
00:20:34.022 --> 00:20:35.284
Moo!

431
00:20:35.390 --> 00:20:37.654
That is very impressive.
Now, what kind of experiments


432
00:20:37.759 --> 00:20:39.351
you guys been doing lately?

433
00:20:39.461 --> 00:20:42.953
Lately, we've been just fucking the dog
and selling the pups.


434
00:20:48.270 --> 00:20:50.261
Really, man.

435
00:20:50.372 --> 00:20:51.270
That's-
- That's great, Bob.

436
00:20:51.373 --> 00:20:53.534
We're on national TV.

437
00:20:53.642 --> 00:20:54.540
Really?

438
00:20:54.643 --> 00:20:56.235
Hey, anybody want to buy a pup?

439
00:20:56.344 --> 00:20:58.369
- Oh, let's--
- They're really cute.


440
00:20:58.480 --> 00:21:01.506
Tell you what. Why don't we just get
right into the game, okay?


441
00:21:01.616 --> 00:21:02.878
All right, you know the rules.

442
00:21:02.984 --> 00:21:06.078
You start off with a stash
of 10 ounces of BC bud.


443
00:21:06.188 --> 00:21:07.086
Oh, 10 ounces?

444
00:21:07.189 --> 00:21:08.087
10 ounces.

445
00:21:08.190 --> 00:21:09.088
Can I quit now?

446
00:21:09.191 --> 00:21:11.659
Uh.

447
00:21:11.760 --> 00:21:13.387
No, no, no,
you have to play the game.


448
00:21:13.495 --> 00:21:14.621
All right, Bob,

449
00:21:14.729 --> 00:21:16.060
now, the questions
get harder at every level.


450
00:21:16.164 --> 00:21:18.928
So how many ounces you want
to bet on the first question?


451
00:21:19.034 --> 00:21:19.932
The whole 10, man.

452
00:21:20.035 --> 00:21:20.933
All of them!

453
00:21:21.036 --> 00:21:23.129
He's gonna double his stash.

454
00:21:23.238 --> 00:21:24.466
Double my stash.

455
00:21:25.674 --> 00:21:26.936
All right, here we go, Bob.

456
00:21:27.042 --> 00:21:27.940
For 15 ounces, you ready?

457
00:21:28.043 --> 00:21:28.975
Okay.

458
00:21:29.077 --> 00:21:31.238
All right, 15 ounces. Here we go.

459
00:21:31.346 --> 00:21:34.838
For our first question,
what is your name?


460
00:21:37.586 --> 00:21:39.611
It's Bob.

461
00:21:39.721 --> 00:21:40.813
Dumb fuck.

462
00:21:40.922 --> 00:21:43.356
This is the easiest question.

463
00:21:43.458 --> 00:21:47.326
Remember? I said,
"Hey, let's have a big hand for..."


464
00:21:47.429 --> 00:21:48.327
Neal.

465
00:21:48.430 --> 00:21:50.455
- No, no, no. Close.
- Bob.


466
00:21:50.565 --> 00:21:53.159
Bob, all right, Bob.

467
00:21:55.437 --> 00:21:57.462
All right, Bob,
you now have 9 ounces.


468
00:21:57.572 --> 00:21:58.732
Way to go, okay.

469
00:21:58.840 --> 00:22:02.537
How many you want to bet this round?

470
00:22:02.644 --> 00:22:03.542
Well, all of them--

471
00:22:03.645 --> 00:22:04.543
All of them!

472
00:22:04.646 --> 00:22:05.738
He's gonna double the stash again.

473
00:22:05.847 --> 00:22:07.576
All right, here we go, Bob.

474
00:22:07.682 --> 00:22:10.048
Second question, gets harder now.

475
00:22:10.151 --> 00:22:12.142
Spell your name.

476
00:22:14.189 --> 00:22:15.087
Spell your name.

477
00:22:15.190 --> 00:22:16.088
Spell Bob.

478
00:22:16.191 --> 00:22:17.089
Spell Bob?

479
00:22:17.192 --> 00:22:18.159
Spell Bob.

480
00:22:18.260 --> 00:22:19.454
All right, I'll give you a hint.

481
00:22:19.561 --> 00:22:20.459
It starts with a B.

482
00:22:20.562 --> 00:22:21.460
B.

483
00:22:21.563 --> 00:22:23.394
B, right.

484
00:22:23.498 --> 00:22:24.487
O!

485
00:22:24.599 --> 00:22:26.692
Uh, I'll give you another hint.

486
00:22:26.801 --> 00:22:27.893
It ends with a B.

487
00:22:28.003 --> 00:22:29.937
BB.

488
00:22:30.038 --> 00:22:31.471
So close. So close.

489
00:22:31.573 --> 00:22:34.167
Tell you what. I'm going to double
your stash again.


490
00:22:34.276 --> 00:22:35.368
What do you think of that?

491
00:22:35.477 --> 00:22:36.739
- Oh!
- Absolutely right-- O.


492
00:22:36.845 --> 00:22:38.312
B
-O
-B.

493
00:22:38.413 --> 00:22:40.608
You just went on to the next level.

494
00:22:40.715 --> 00:22:42.774
- Way to go. Let's have a hand for him.
- I'm on a roll, man.


495
00:22:42.884 --> 00:22:43.976
You're on a roll.

496
00:22:44.085 --> 00:22:45.552
All right, how many
do you want to bet now?


497
00:22:45.654 --> 00:22:46.643
All of them.

498
00:22:46.755 --> 00:22:47.722
He's gonna double his stash again.

499
00:22:47.822 --> 00:22:48.720
Here we go, Bob.

500
00:22:48.823 --> 00:22:51.223
For 9 ounces--

501
00:22:51.326 --> 00:22:53.089
Wait a minute, man.

502
00:22:53.194 --> 00:22:54.092
What?

503
00:22:54.195 --> 00:22:56.663
I started out with 10, man.

504
00:22:56.765 --> 00:22:58.926
Yeah, and you doubled it.
You doubled it again.


505
00:22:59.034 --> 00:23:00.194
You're gonna double to a third time.

506
00:23:00.302 --> 00:23:01.826
Three times three is nine.

507
00:23:01.937 --> 00:23:04.531
Oh, okay.

508
00:23:06.274 --> 00:23:07.832
All right, Bob, for 9 ounces,

509
00:23:07.943 --> 00:23:09.103
questions get harder--

510
00:23:09.210 --> 00:23:10.108
Bob!

511
00:23:10.211 --> 00:23:11.109
Right, Bob, that's--

512
00:23:11.212 --> 00:23:12.110
You're in the right direction.

513
00:23:12.213 --> 00:23:15.273
But spell Bob backwards.

514
00:23:19.521 --> 00:23:20.419
B
-O
-B.

515
00:23:20.522 --> 00:23:21.420
Absolutely right.

516
00:23:21.523 --> 00:23:22.820
B
-O
-B.

517
00:23:25.260 --> 00:23:27.626
- Aah, he's too smart.
- Go, Longhorns!


518
00:23:27.729 --> 00:23:28.627
You're sharp as a spoon.

519
00:23:28.730 --> 00:23:29.662
Here we go.

520
00:23:29.764 --> 00:23:32.062
You have 5 ounces now.
Here we go.


521
00:23:32.167 --> 00:23:35.967
For 5 ounces, complete this phrase.

522
00:23:36.071 --> 00:23:38.631
No stems, no seeds
that you don't need


523
00:23:38.740 --> 00:23:39.672
Acapulco gold is--

524
00:23:39.774 --> 00:23:40.672
Bad-ass weed

525
00:23:40.775 --> 00:23:43.471
Absolutely right.

526
00:23:43.578 --> 00:23:46.979
Absolutely right.
You have 3 ounces, Bob.


527
00:23:47.082 --> 00:23:48.640
Whoa!

528
00:23:48.750 --> 00:23:52.015
All right. Last question, Bob.

529
00:23:52.120 --> 00:23:54.554
In front of you, you see three doors.

530
00:23:56.224 --> 00:23:59.284
Oh, that's right. 
Morrison died.

531
00:23:59.394 --> 00:24:00.292
No--

532
00:24:00.395 --> 00:24:01.862
No, not those kind of Doors, Bob.

533
00:24:01.963 --> 00:24:03.328
I know.

534
00:24:03.431 --> 00:24:06.628
I just wanted to see how many
old fucks are here tonight.


535
00:24:07.836 --> 00:24:09.997
Well, sounds like a lot of old fucks.

536
00:24:10.105 --> 00:24:12.596
All right, behind one of those doors, Bob,

537
00:24:12.707 --> 00:24:15.335
is 100 pounds of Willy Weed.

538
00:24:15.443 --> 00:24:16.603
Ooh.

539
00:24:16.711 --> 00:24:17.609
100 pounds.

540
00:24:17.712 --> 00:24:18.610
I want that door, man.

541
00:24:18.713 --> 00:24:20.578
I'll bet you do.

542
00:24:20.682 --> 00:24:22.582
Behind another one of those doors, Bob,

543
00:24:22.684 --> 00:24:26.017
is 500 pounds of Black Afghani hash.

544
00:24:26.121 --> 00:24:28.885
Ooh.

545
00:24:28.990 --> 00:24:30.685
How long has it been
since you've had hash?


546
00:24:30.792 --> 00:24:32.987
Look at my eyes, man.

547
00:24:33.094 --> 00:24:34.561
About 15 minutes, yeah.

548
00:24:34.663 --> 00:24:36.563
Very good. Very good.

549
00:24:36.665 --> 00:24:40.601
But behind another one of those doors
is Sergeant Sedanko of the DEA.


550
00:24:40.702 --> 00:24:42.226
Ooh.

551
00:24:42.337 --> 00:24:44.168
We don't want that door, do we?

552
00:24:44.272 --> 00:24:45.569
I don't want to get busted, man.

553
00:24:45.674 --> 00:24:47.471
Very good. Good strategy.

554
00:24:47.575 --> 00:24:49.065
All right, so what will it be, Bob?

555
00:24:49.177 --> 00:24:51.839
Will it be door number 1,
door number 2, or door number 3?


556
00:24:51.946 --> 00:24:53.846
- 4.
- 4-- We don't have 4.


557
00:24:53.948 --> 00:24:55.245
I don't want to get busted, man.

558
00:24:55.350 --> 00:24:57.443
I know, but you got
to choose 1, 2, or 3.

559
00:24:57.552 --> 00:24:58.484
Come on, 1, 2, or 3.

560
00:24:58.586 --> 00:24:59.678
- 2, 1.
- 2, 1.


561
00:24:59.788 --> 00:25:01.585
1, 1, 2, 1, 2--

562
00:25:01.690 --> 00:25:02.714
- 3.
- 3.


563
00:25:02.824 --> 00:25:04.155
Okay, 2.

564
00:25:04.259 --> 00:25:05.590
All right, 2.
Let's open up door number 2


565
00:25:05.694 --> 00:25:06.786
and see what's behind that door.

566
00:25:06.895 --> 00:25:08.487
It's 500 pounds of Black Afghani hash!

567
00:25:08.596 --> 00:25:10.427
You win the grand prize, Bob!

568
00:25:10.532 --> 00:25:12.966
Get the grand prize up here for him.

569
00:25:17.472 --> 00:25:20.134
Let me show you where my heart is.

570
00:25:20.241 --> 00:25:23.233
I'm going to donate all my hash
to you people, yes.


571
00:25:23.344 --> 00:25:24.538
Yeah, I'll take the hash.

572
00:25:24.646 --> 00:25:25.544
Yeah, man.

573
00:25:25.647 --> 00:25:27.137
Sell that motherfucker.

574
00:25:27.248 --> 00:25:28.613
I can fence it for you.

575
00:25:29.851 --> 00:25:31.716
How many Mexicans are here tonight?

576
00:25:34.255 --> 00:25:35.950
Okay.

577
00:25:36.057 --> 00:25:38.048
Okay.

578
00:25:38.159 --> 00:25:40.559
How many are here illegally?

579
00:25:40.662 --> 00:25:43.256
Eh, ¿qué pasa?

580
00:25:43.364 --> 00:25:46.424
We did research
and we found that Mexicans


581
00:25:46.534 --> 00:25:49.628
are in every state
of the Union in America.


582
00:25:50.905 --> 00:25:55.365
Every state, including Alaska.

583
00:25:55.477 --> 00:25:57.570
I met Cheech in Canada.
That's how far he snuck up.


584
00:25:57.679 --> 00:26:00.079
All the way to Canada.

585
00:26:00.181 --> 00:26:02.911
Who, me, me, me, me

586
00:26:03.017 --> 00:26:06.384
Yeah, you, you, you, you

587
00:26:06.488 --> 00:26:07.716
Oh--

588
00:26:07.822 --> 00:26:10.222
Oh, crap. Come on, man.

589
00:26:17.799 --> 00:26:18.993
Ow.

590
00:26:22.437 --> 00:26:26.396
There's only one place
that Mexicans have not conquered yet.


591
00:26:26.508 --> 00:26:28.703
They haven't snuck into outer space.

592
00:26:28.810 --> 00:26:30.607
Tonight we're going
to take care of that.


593
00:26:30.712 --> 00:26:34.011
We're going to show you
the first Mexican in outer space.


594
00:26:34.115 --> 00:26:36.276
Here he is.

595
00:26:43.124 --> 00:26:45.592
Hey, man, you see those guys there?

596
00:26:45.693 --> 00:26:46.625
Ooo.

597
00:26:46.728 --> 00:26:47.626
Who's this little cutie pie?

598
00:26:47.729 --> 00:26:49.162
Oh, this is Javier.

599
00:26:49.264 --> 00:26:50.162
Say hi to Shelby.

600
00:26:50.265 --> 00:26:51.163
Hello, Shelby.

601
00:26:51.266 --> 00:26:52.528
Oh, hi, Javier.

602
00:26:52.634 --> 00:26:54.192
They must be friends of Cheech's.

603
00:26:54.302 --> 00:26:56.702
Is that a dog collar he's wearing?

604
00:26:56.805 --> 00:26:59.365
He has everything he owns
wearing collars.


605
00:27:44.786 --> 00:27:46.651
Launch sequence engaged.

606
00:27:46.754 --> 00:27:49.985
10, 9, 8, 7, 6,

607
00:27:50.091 --> 00:27:54.585
5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

608
00:27:54.696 --> 00:27:56.323
Ignition.

609
00:28:45.546 --> 00:28:47.343
Oh, look at all you pigeons.

610
00:28:47.448 --> 00:28:49.643
You know ol' Charlie's coming, don't you?

611
00:28:49.751 --> 00:28:52.185
Yeah, there-
- There you go.

612
00:28:52.287 --> 00:28:54.221
Here's some bread crumbs for you.

613
00:28:54.322 --> 00:28:56.415
Oh, I got some cookies, too.

614
00:28:56.524 --> 00:28:58.389
Oh, you like this, don't you?

615
00:28:58.493 --> 00:28:59.960
There you go.

616
00:29:00.061 --> 00:29:02.086
Oh, don't get greedy.
There's enough for everybody.


617
00:29:02.196 --> 00:29:04.323
Oh, come on.

618
00:29:04.432 --> 00:29:05.421
Get your little--

619
00:29:05.533 --> 00:29:06.830
Come on, little fat butt over here.

620
00:29:09.304 --> 00:29:10.794
Oh, you're a big fat guy, aren't you?

621
00:29:10.905 --> 00:29:13.100
Come on over here. There you go.

622
00:29:15.777 --> 00:29:17.642
He got that pigeon good, didn't he?

623
00:29:24.919 --> 00:29:27.786
Yep, gonna have a little
pigeon taco tonight.


624
00:29:27.889 --> 00:29:29.789
Have you ever had squab?

625
00:29:29.891 --> 00:29:30.983
And here he comes. Pick him up.

626
00:29:35.463 --> 00:29:37.192
Hey, fuck you.

627
00:29:38.366 --> 00:29:40.800
Yeah, fuck you, too.

628
00:29:45.273 --> 00:29:47.002
Hey, fuck you, too.

629
00:29:47.108 --> 00:29:48.541
Hey, we know him, man.

630
00:29:48.643 --> 00:29:50.304
- Yeah.
- Hey, give us some beer.


631
00:30:04.759 --> 00:30:06.920
Excuse me, sir.

632
00:30:07.028 --> 00:30:07.926
Huh?

633
00:30:08.029 --> 00:30:12.432
I don't want to interrupt your meal,
but do you speak English?


634
00:30:12.533 --> 00:30:13.966
Uh, yeah.

635
00:30:14.068 --> 00:30:15.865
Good. Fuck off.

636
00:30:18.172 --> 00:30:20.834
Hey, that's good. 
I like you, old man.

637
00:30:20.942 --> 00:30:23.672
"Fuck off."

638
00:30:23.778 --> 00:30:27.578
Hey, want some beer, man?
Come on, have some beer.


639
00:30:27.682 --> 00:30:28.774
Oh, I get it. I get it.

640
00:30:28.883 --> 00:30:30.009
You speak it,

641
00:30:30.118 --> 00:30:32.143
but you don't understand it.
Is that your problem?


642
00:30:32.253 --> 00:30:34.221
What?

643
00:30:34.322 --> 00:30:36.415
Oh, then can I
ask you a serious question?

644
00:30:36.524 --> 00:30:38.321
Okay, okay.

645
00:30:38.426 --> 00:30:41.054
Did you shit your pants?

646
00:30:41.162 --> 00:30:43.289
Uh, yeah, I did, man.

647
00:30:44.432 --> 00:30:46.093
How could you tell?

648
00:30:46.200 --> 00:30:48.964
Well, why the hell don't you go home
and change them, for Christ's sake?


649
00:30:49.070 --> 00:30:50.594
Hey, I ain't done yet, man.

650
00:30:53.841 --> 00:30:54.739
Hey, pull my finger.

651
00:30:54.842 --> 00:30:57.709
Get the hell out of here.

652
00:31:00.548 --> 00:31:02.709
If you don't fuck off,
I'm gonna get out of this chair


653
00:31:02.817 --> 00:31:04.216
and I'm gonna kick you in the balls.

654
00:31:04.318 --> 00:31:06.445
Oh, you gonna kick me
in the balls, huh?


655
00:31:06.554 --> 00:31:11.014
Okay, Pele, give it a shot, man.

656
00:31:11.125 --> 00:31:12.854
Bend them like Beckham.

657
00:31:15.530 --> 00:31:21.196
Well, you sure the hell
don't give a guy much of a target, do you?


658
00:31:21.302 --> 00:31:25.534
Hey, hey, you're
really funny, funny bunny.


659
00:31:27.341 --> 00:31:28.831
Come on, let's play a game, funny bunny.

660
00:31:28.943 --> 00:31:29.841
Don't touch me.

661
00:31:32.814 --> 00:31:34.111
Come on, let's play some--

662
00:31:34.215 --> 00:31:36.046
Let's play race car driver, okay?

663
00:31:41.856 --> 00:31:45.314
You like that one?

664
00:31:45.426 --> 00:31:48.418
You know, you should have
more respect for me.


665
00:31:48.529 --> 00:31:50.053
Oh, yeah, why's that?

666
00:31:50.164 --> 00:31:53.429
For all you know,
I could be your daddy.


667
00:31:53.534 --> 00:31:56.970
- Yeah, you could be my daddy.
- That's right.


668
00:31:57.071 --> 00:31:59.403
I used to fuck buffalos.

669
00:32:03.778 --> 00:32:06.679
By Jesus, you look an awful lot
like your mama, you know that?


670
00:32:06.781 --> 00:32:08.772
- Hey.
- Well, you do.


671
00:32:08.883 --> 00:32:11.283
And you sure the hell smell like her.
That's for goddamn sure.


672
00:32:11.385 --> 00:32:13.285
That's enough, man.
Come on, you want to get down?


673
00:32:13.387 --> 00:32:15.014
You think I'm scared of you,
you son of a bitch?


674
00:32:17.191 --> 00:32:18.920
I'll give you one in the head.

675
00:32:24.398 --> 00:32:28.027
Hey, no time outs, man, come on.

676
00:32:33.741 --> 00:32:36.801
Hey, I'm going to take your wallet.

677
00:32:36.911 --> 00:32:39.744
I'm going to take your wallet.

678
00:32:39.847 --> 00:32:43.214
Fucking pigeon in here, God damn.

679
00:32:43.317 --> 00:32:46.582
¡Cochino!

680
00:32:48.022 --> 00:32:50.320
Hey, come on, dude.
Quit fucking around.


681
00:32:50.424 --> 00:32:51.322
Come on, let's go.

682
00:32:51.425 --> 00:32:53.450
I was having a good--

683
00:32:53.561 --> 00:32:55.222
- Hey.
- Hey.


684
00:32:57.532 --> 00:32:59.329
Oh, fuck.

685
00:32:59.433 --> 00:33:02.095
Hey, hey, sir.

686
00:33:05.940 --> 00:33:08.204
Hey, Mister sir.

687
00:33:10.178 --> 00:33:11.076
Hey, oh, shit.

688
00:33:11.179 --> 00:33:13.340
Oh, shit, fuck, God damn.

689
00:33:13.447 --> 00:33:16.439
Hey, I'm on parole, fucker.

690
00:33:16.551 --> 00:33:17.916
Hey, run.

691
00:33:18.019 --> 00:33:18.917
Oh, fuck, I'm sorry, dude.

692
00:33:19.020 --> 00:33:20.487
I'm sorry, I didn't mean--

693
00:33:20.588 --> 00:33:23.148
Scared the shit out of you that time.

694
00:33:23.257 --> 00:33:25.020
Didn't l, you little bastard.

695
00:33:26.460 --> 00:33:27.620
I knew he wasn't dead.

696
00:33:27.728 --> 00:33:28.626
Oh, yeah?

697
00:33:28.729 --> 00:33:29.753
- Yeah.
- Oh.


698
00:33:29.864 --> 00:33:31.957
Because they got to do
the rest of the show, man.


699
00:33:32.066 --> 00:33:32.964
Oh, yeah.

700
00:33:33.067 --> 00:33:35.695
That's Chong. That's Chong.

701
00:33:35.803 --> 00:33:37.703
Go, out. Everybody out.

702
00:33:37.805 --> 00:33:39.204
There we go.

703
00:33:39.307 --> 00:33:40.774
Okay, standby to restore.

704
00:33:40.875 --> 00:33:42.638
Same thing, in the center on Tommy.

705
00:33:42.743 --> 00:33:44.836
Thank you.

706
00:33:46.948 --> 00:33:50.213
Before we get into
our music portion of the show,


707
00:33:50.318 --> 00:33:53.412
I would like to talk to you
a little bit about my time in jail.


708
00:33:53.521 --> 00:33:55.751
Hey, homeboy.

709
00:33:55.856 --> 00:33:59.019
Up here. We've been in jail.

710
00:33:59.126 --> 00:34:01.356
It's not as bad
as you think it is.

711
00:34:01.462 --> 00:34:02.554
You know all that Bubba stuff?

712
00:34:02.663 --> 00:34:04.028
That homo stuff?

713
00:34:04.131 --> 00:34:05.029
It's not true.

714
00:34:05.132 --> 00:34:06.599
It doesn't hurt.

715
00:34:06.701 --> 00:34:09.465
No, I'm only kidding. 
I'm only kidding.

716
00:34:11.372 --> 00:34:12.270
Hickey, come on, two minutes.

717
00:34:12.373 --> 00:34:15.399
Oh, okay.

718
00:34:15.509 --> 00:34:17.704
Me, me, me, me, me, me, me

719
00:34:19.146 --> 00:34:21.740
You, you, you, you, you, you, you

720
00:34:22.917 --> 00:34:24.908
Him, him, him, him, him, him, him

721
00:34:25.019 --> 00:34:27.783
They put me in jail for bongs, right?

722
00:34:27.888 --> 00:34:29.788
The whole time I was in jail,
I kept thinking,


723
00:34:29.890 --> 00:34:31.551
"What were they trying to prove here?"

724
00:34:31.659 --> 00:34:34.560
Take away our bongs,
we won't be able to smoke our dope?


725
00:34:34.662 --> 00:34:37.756
Because the truth is you get a bud
and no way to smoke it,


726
00:34:37.865 --> 00:34:40.265
you turn into MacGyver
in a heartbeat, don't you?


727
00:34:43.971 --> 00:34:47.737
I've known hippies that couldn't find
their ass with either hand,


728
00:34:47.842 --> 00:34:49.935
but hand them anything
and tell them to make a pipe,


729
00:34:50.044 --> 00:34:51.739
and they'll grab it--

730
00:34:57.518 --> 00:34:58.849
I got it.

731
00:34:58.953 --> 00:35:02.286
You can use anything
to smoke pot out of, man.


732
00:35:02.390 --> 00:35:05.621
My favorite is a Tampax tube.

733
00:35:05.726 --> 00:35:09.594
Got a real familiar taste,

734
00:35:09.697 --> 00:35:12.632
built-in filter,

735
00:35:12.733 --> 00:35:14.633
and the greatest thing--
if you got to hide it,


736
00:35:14.735 --> 00:35:16.066
just hand it to your old lady.

737
00:35:18.906 --> 00:35:20.567
And it's got the
little flag on the end

738
00:35:20.675 --> 00:35:22.165
so you always know
where your dope is.


739
00:35:29.016 --> 00:35:32.110
Oh, shit.

740
00:35:44.498 --> 00:35:49.094
The other thing I had to do in jail was
I had to take a drug education course.


741
00:35:49.203 --> 00:35:51.262
Well, actually, I taught it.

742
00:35:51.372 --> 00:35:52.566
I did.

743
00:35:52.673 --> 00:35:54.265
Fuckers didn't know
anything about dope, man.


744
00:35:54.375 --> 00:35:57.674
They're trying to tell us
that marijuana is a dangerous drug.


745
00:35:57.778 --> 00:35:59.075
I told them. I said marijuana is

746
00:35:59.180 --> 00:36:01.808
the friendliest drug
you'll ever come across.


747
00:36:01.916 --> 00:36:04.146
- Right?

748
00:36:04.251 --> 00:36:07.914
Listen to me. It's the only drug I know
where you take a hit,


749
00:36:08.022 --> 00:36:12.083
your first impulse is
to give it to somebody.

750
00:36:15.162 --> 00:36:16.254
But I like this one, too.

751
00:36:16.364 --> 00:36:17.695
Marijuana makes you
lazy and unmotivated.


752
00:36:17.798 --> 00:36:20.266
Whoa.

753
00:36:20.368 --> 00:36:23.860
Now, there's a reason
to put someone in jail, huh?


754
00:36:23.971 --> 00:36:25.199
Pretty soon, that'll be against the law,

755
00:36:25.306 --> 00:36:26.796
and I'll be the first guy in court.

756
00:36:26.907 --> 00:36:28.204
I can just see the judge now.

757
00:36:28.309 --> 00:36:29.936
He'll be looking at me going,

758
00:36:30.044 --> 00:36:32.410
"Mr. Chong, you have been charged
with being lazy and unmotivated.


759
00:36:32.513 --> 00:36:35.949
How do you plead? Mr. Chong?"

760
00:36:37.184 --> 00:36:40.585
"Bailiff, will you wake
the prisoner, please?"


761
00:36:40.688 --> 00:36:42.713
Well, it's true.
Marijuana does make you lazy.


762
00:36:42.823 --> 00:36:45.291
In fact, I remember
one time I was stoned.


763
00:36:45.393 --> 00:36:47.122
I'm laying on the couch,

764
00:36:47.228 --> 00:36:50.755
and I couldn't find
that channel changer, man.


765
00:36:50.865 --> 00:36:53.197
But I noticed if I moved
my ass a certain way,


766
00:36:53.300 --> 00:36:56.360
the TV would change anyway.

767
00:36:57.772 --> 00:37:01.230
I never did find that changer, man.

768
00:37:01.342 --> 00:37:05.073
But I got so good, I could
TiVo that motherfucker.


769
00:37:05.179 --> 00:37:07.010
Let's go, buddy.

770
00:37:07.114 --> 00:37:08.911
Our first musical guest tonight

771
00:37:09.016 --> 00:37:11.644
is a young man that appeared
in Cheech and Chong's Next Movie.


772
00:37:11.852 --> 00:37:13.547
Let's hear it for Red Hickey!

773
00:37:25.366 --> 00:37:26.458
How y'all tonight?

774
00:37:26.567 --> 00:37:27.465
Hey, man, where's the bathroom?

775
00:37:27.568 --> 00:37:28.660
You have to use the dressing room.

776
00:37:28.769 --> 00:37:30.202
That's the only one that's available.

777
00:37:30.304 --> 00:37:32.670
I-- l-
- I'm kind of nervous up here.

778
00:37:32.773 --> 00:37:34.104
I'm a street singer.

779
00:37:34.208 --> 00:37:36.699
I'm not used to being
on the stage or nothing, boy.


780
00:37:36.811 --> 00:37:40.611
Boy, I'm so nervous, you couldn't get a pin
up my ass with a jackhammer right now.


781
00:37:40.714 --> 00:37:43.046
I'll tell you what.

782
00:37:43.150 --> 00:37:44.378
Thank you very much.

783
00:37:48.022 --> 00:37:52.220
Aah, hey, Chong.
What's up, motherfucker?


784
00:37:52.326 --> 00:37:54.123
Hey, hey, it's me-
- Juno.

785
00:37:54.228 --> 00:37:55.126
How'd you get in here?

786
00:37:55.229 --> 00:37:57.527
Oh, man, it's me-
- Juno, you know?

787
00:37:57.631 --> 00:37:58.529
Juno?

788
00:37:58.632 --> 00:37:59.690
Juno what I'm talking about?

789
00:37:59.800 --> 00:38:03.600
God damn, it's hot up here
with all these lights and everything.


790
00:38:03.704 --> 00:38:06.502
I get relative humidity, you know?

791
00:38:06.607 --> 00:38:08.472
That's the sweat that forms on your balls

792
00:38:08.576 --> 00:38:11.067
when you're doing your cousin.
You know, relative humidity?


793
00:38:13.914 --> 00:38:15.711
You get it?

794
00:38:15.816 --> 00:38:17.010
Thank you very much.

795
00:38:17.117 --> 00:38:19.642
Aah, you look good, motherfucker.

796
00:38:19.753 --> 00:38:20.651
Yeah.

797
00:38:23.791 --> 00:38:26.225
You know, y'all ought to
put me on the show, man.


798
00:38:26.327 --> 00:38:29.091
I'm a rapper. I do rap.
I could breakdance, and l--


799
00:38:29.196 --> 00:38:31.926
- Oh.
- I could introduce y'all.


800
00:38:32.032 --> 00:38:33.556
Right, right, a black rapper in jail.

801
00:38:33.667 --> 00:38:36.067
- Yeah, now I remember you.
- Yeah, yeah, all right.


802
00:38:36.170 --> 00:38:39.264
What do you get when you
cross a leprechaun with a prostitute?


803
00:38:39.373 --> 00:38:42.001
You get a little bitty fucker
about that big.


804
00:38:45.045 --> 00:38:47.707
You get it?

805
00:38:49.550 --> 00:38:51.347
-
- Thank you very much.


806
00:38:51.452 --> 00:38:52.851
How'd you get in here?

807
00:38:52.953 --> 00:38:56.150
I got a little gig
delivering Chinese food, man,


808
00:38:56.257 --> 00:38:59.658
so I thought, hey, bring this over
to the theater for Chong.


809
00:38:59.760 --> 00:39:01.751
Man, that mother's my dawg, man.

810
00:39:01.862 --> 00:39:03.056
Yeah.

811
00:39:03.163 --> 00:39:05.654
How you jack off a dinosaur?

812
00:39:05.766 --> 00:39:08.530
Like this here.

813
00:39:18.712 --> 00:39:21.579
You get it?

814
00:39:21.682 --> 00:39:23.377
-
- Thank you very much.


815
00:39:23.484 --> 00:39:25.247
Could y'all help me out, man?

816
00:39:25.352 --> 00:39:27.343
I'm a little short right now.
Maybe, you know, a couple hundred,


817
00:39:27.454 --> 00:39:29.217
500, a thousand,
whatever you got, you know.


818
00:39:29.323 --> 00:39:30.984
You know, I don't
carry any cash on me.

819
00:39:31.091 --> 00:39:32.820
I'm right in the middle
of the show, man.


820
00:39:32.927 --> 00:39:34.360
I'd really like to do it, but l--

821
00:39:34.461 --> 00:39:36.326
Yeah, gonna be like that?
All right. All right.


822
00:39:36.430 --> 00:39:37.658
No, seriously, man.

823
00:39:37.765 --> 00:39:41.360
Well, you know, I just
brought your Chinese food.


824
00:39:41.468 --> 00:39:45.063
So have your Chinese food,
Chinese motherfucker.


825
00:39:45.172 --> 00:39:47.834
We've been traveling all over the country
with the Ching and Chang show.


826
00:39:47.942 --> 00:39:51.036
Sometimes we don't know
where the hell we are, you know?


827
00:39:51.145 --> 00:39:55.445
But I knew today that we were coming
to San Antonio, Texas, boy.


828
00:40:02.756 --> 00:40:04.121
And I love San Antonio

829
00:40:04.224 --> 00:40:07.421
'cause my dear departed daddy,
he was from San Antonio.


830
00:40:07.528 --> 00:40:09.860
I remember the last words
he ever said to me.


831
00:40:09.964 --> 00:40:13.832
He said, "Hey, watch this."

832
00:40:20.841 --> 00:40:23.674
-
- Thank you very much.


833
00:40:23.777 --> 00:40:25.335
I'd like to liven up the mood here,

834
00:40:25.446 --> 00:40:28.882
and I want-- l-l-I want--
I want to sing a song.


835
00:40:30.050 --> 00:40:31.915
Thank you very much.

836
00:40:32.019 --> 00:40:35.819
I want to dedicate it
to my girlfriend of 16 years.


837
00:40:35.923 --> 00:40:38.483
Well, she'll be 16
in about two weeks, so--


838
00:40:40.027 --> 00:40:41.995
-
- Thank you very much.


839
00:40:42.096 --> 00:40:44.758
- I always love dressing cowboy, don't you?
- Mm-hmm.


840
00:40:44.865 --> 00:40:47.129
Boy, these young girls today,
I'll tell you what, man.


841
00:40:47.234 --> 00:40:50.101
Th-they're all wild.
They got piercings and tattoos


842
00:40:50.204 --> 00:40:51.899
all over every place, you know?

843
00:40:52.006 --> 00:40:56.966
I think he pulls it off.
I think he pulled it off a scarecrow.


844
00:40:57.077 --> 00:40:58.203
My girl come home t'other day,

845
00:40:58.312 --> 00:41:00.337
and she had a
tattoo of a clam shell

846
00:41:00.447 --> 00:41:02.574
right on her inner thigh
there, you know?


847
00:41:02.683 --> 00:41:05.208
You could put your head up to it
and smell the ocean, you know?


848
00:41:05.319 --> 00:41:07.378
It was just a beautiful thing.

849
00:41:07.488 --> 00:41:09.820
Beautiful.

850
00:41:11.725 --> 00:41:13.454
All right, so I want to
sing you a little song.


851
00:41:13.560 --> 00:41:16.324
And it's a love song,
and if you know the words,


852
00:41:16.430 --> 00:41:18.421
I want you to join on in.
Okay? Here goes.


853
00:41:18.532 --> 00:41:20.193
Goes something like this here.

854
00:41:20.300 --> 00:41:22.200
Me

855
00:41:22.302 --> 00:41:25.396
And my old lady

856
00:41:25.506 --> 00:41:28.942
We like, we like,
we like to get outside


857
00:41:29.043 --> 00:41:30.533
Oh, thank you very much.

858
00:41:30.644 --> 00:41:35.445
But sometimes people
space us out


859
00:41:35.549 --> 00:41:41.044
So we just make like a bakery truck
and haul buns out of there


860
00:41:41.155 --> 00:41:45.854
Oh, sometimes we are
so much in love


861
00:41:45.959 --> 00:41:51.192
That we go on a picnic
and don't even take any beer


862
00:41:51.298 --> 00:41:54.062
We just cruise around

863
00:41:54.168 --> 00:41:55.965
Looking for the main drag in town

864
00:41:56.070 --> 00:41:57.537
Listen to this cowboy motherfucker.

865
00:41:57.638 --> 00:42:02.598
We go to the 7-Eleven
and get ourselves some beef jerky


866
00:42:02.710 --> 00:42:04.439
Motherfucker's song don't even rhyme.

867
00:42:04.545 --> 00:42:07.070
...and my old lady

868
00:42:07.181 --> 00:42:11.277
Oh we like, we like,
we like to get outside


869
00:42:15.355 --> 00:42:16.822
Thank you very much.

870
00:42:16.924 --> 00:42:19.256
- You like country music?
- Yeah, I do, man.


871
00:42:21.528 --> 00:42:23.689
- I like that one song.
- Which one?


872
00:42:23.797 --> 00:42:27.597
Oh, that "l lost my dog."

873
00:42:27.701 --> 00:42:29.328
I want to bring out another
musical friend of mine.


874
00:42:29.436 --> 00:42:31.927
Ain't no motherfucking friend of mine.

875
00:42:32.039 --> 00:42:34.337
He's from Africa, Mississippi.

876
00:42:35.476 --> 00:42:36.966
So let's have a big, warm welcome

877
00:42:37.077 --> 00:42:41.241
for none other than Blind Melon Chitlin.
Come on.


878
00:42:45.018 --> 00:42:47.282
He's so old, he farts dust.

879
00:42:49.623 --> 00:42:51.887
Blind Melon, head him on--

880
00:42:51.992 --> 00:42:53.550
Gonna walk off the fucking stage there.

881
00:42:53.660 --> 00:42:55.753
Come on, over here,
Blind Melon. Hyah, hyah.


882
00:42:55.863 --> 00:42:58.263
Here, doggie, hyah, hyah.
Hyah hyah hyah.


883
00:42:58.365 --> 00:43:00.230
Hyah, hyah. There.

884
00:43:01.735 --> 00:43:03.327
All right, there you go.
Let's have another hand for him.


885
00:43:03.437 --> 00:43:06.201
Blind Melon Chitlin. Come on.

886
00:43:20.621 --> 00:43:22.953
He ain't playing it. 
That ain't him, is it?

887
00:43:23.056 --> 00:43:25.991
- Yeah.
- Nah, that ain't him.


888
00:43:26.093 --> 00:43:27.321
It's a record.

889
00:44:00.494 --> 00:44:03.224
I'm Blind Melon Chitlin

890
00:44:04.965 --> 00:44:08.867
I used to drink 4 quarts
of whiskey every day


891
00:44:15.142 --> 00:44:18.009
Then I started pissing
blood in the morning


892
00:44:20.414 --> 00:44:23.406
So I stopped that shit right away

893
00:44:23.517 --> 00:44:25.246
I can't understand
a word he's saying.


894
00:44:25.352 --> 00:44:26.717
- But he's sober.
- Not a fucking word.


895
00:44:26.820 --> 00:44:30.347
He's sober.
Well, I wish he'd get drunk again.


896
00:44:30.457 --> 00:44:33.324
Now all I do is smoke my reefer

897
00:44:35.596 --> 00:44:39.259
And get as high
as a motherfucker every day


898
00:44:39.366 --> 00:44:41.266
Every way

899
00:44:41.368 --> 00:44:46.362
Every goddamn day, yeah

900
00:44:52.412 --> 00:44:54.744
Thank you all.

901
00:44:56.116 --> 00:44:58.084
Thank y'all.

902
00:44:59.353 --> 00:45:00.718
Right now I want to sing a song

903
00:45:00.821 --> 00:45:04.086
and dedicate it to all the freaky women
in the audience tonight.


904
00:45:07.494 --> 00:45:09.962
I love women. I tell you,
when you're blind,


905
00:45:10.063 --> 00:45:11.792
there's only two kind of women--

906
00:45:11.899 --> 00:45:15.300
those that smell good
and those that don't.


907
00:45:15.402 --> 00:45:19.338
I love them both.

908
00:45:19.439 --> 00:45:21.532
Yeah, I love a stinky woman.

909
00:45:21.642 --> 00:45:24.406
At least you know where she's at.

910
00:45:24.511 --> 00:45:27.207
Dah dah dah dah. Yeah.

911
00:45:27.314 --> 00:45:29.612
I had me a freaky woman
the other night.


912
00:45:29.716 --> 00:45:31.650
Oh, let me tell you about her.

913
00:45:31.752 --> 00:45:34.983
I took her home, and the first thing she did
when she walked in the door,


914
00:45:35.088 --> 00:45:37.989
she took off her leg
and put it on the dresser.


915
00:45:39.993 --> 00:45:42.154
Then she took off her titties
and put them on the dresser.


916
00:45:43.597 --> 00:45:45.827
Then she took out her teeth
and her glass eye and her hair,


917
00:45:45.933 --> 00:45:47.491
and put them on the dresser.

918
00:45:47.601 --> 00:45:50.297
Hell, I didn't know whether to get in bed
or get on the dresser.


919
00:45:55.475 --> 00:45:57.807
But that old toothless bitch,
she could sing.


920
00:45:57.911 --> 00:45:59.811
Let me tell you.

921
00:45:59.913 --> 00:46:02.609
So I played a little guitar,

922
00:46:02.716 --> 00:46:05.184
and she sang a song
went like this here.


923
00:46:06.954 --> 00:46:09.115
She said Blind

924
00:46:09.222 --> 00:46:11.417
This party's jumping

925
00:46:11.525 --> 00:46:14.255
- I'm having a good time

926
00:46:14.361 --> 00:46:16.693
But you know what's really on my mind?

927
00:46:16.797 --> 00:46:19.766
Don't clap. You'll fuck me up.

928
00:46:19.866 --> 00:46:23.131
You mind if I get comfortable?

929
00:46:23.236 --> 00:46:26.637
Take off all my shit
and put it on the dresser too


930
00:46:29.409 --> 00:46:31.604
And while I'm giving you some head

931
00:46:31.712 --> 00:46:34.545
Play me some
of your down-home blues


932
00:46:36.249 --> 00:46:37.978
Down-home blues

933
00:46:38.085 --> 00:46:40.349
Down-home blues

934
00:46:40.454 --> 00:46:44.652
All she wanted to hear
was some down-home blues


935
00:46:44.758 --> 00:46:46.885
All night long

936
00:46:46.994 --> 00:46:50.862
It's the only thing she let me do

937
00:46:53.533 --> 00:46:55.728
She gave me the best head

938
00:46:55.836 --> 00:46:59.101
And I boogied off
her down-home blues


939
00:47:00.240 --> 00:47:04.438
I played her some blues, I said.

940
00:47:17.691 --> 00:47:19.989
I said, "Baby, how do you
like my blues so far?"


941
00:47:22.529 --> 00:47:25.555
Well, she looked up at me
with tears in her eyes.


942
00:47:25.665 --> 00:47:27.826
And this is what she said.

943
00:47:32.005 --> 00:47:34.064
Oh, hell, yeah

944
00:47:44.751 --> 00:47:46.275
Down-home blues

945
00:47:46.386 --> 00:47:48.786
Down-home blues

946
00:47:48.889 --> 00:47:51.449
All she wanted to hear was my

947
00:47:51.558 --> 00:47:52.855
Down-home blues.

948
00:47:52.959 --> 00:47:55.553
Well, y'all sound
like a busload of retards, man.


949
00:47:55.662 --> 00:47:57.391
Come on.

950
00:47:57.497 --> 00:47:59.522
Let's do that again.

951
00:47:59.633 --> 00:48:02.295
This time, I want all the men
with dicks over 10 inches,


952
00:48:02.402 --> 00:48:04.267
y'all sing. Here we go.

953
00:48:04.371 --> 00:48:07.272
When I say "Down-home blues,"
you repeat it, here we go.


954
00:48:08.775 --> 00:48:09.833
Down-home blues

955
00:48:09.943 --> 00:48:11.467
Down-home blues.

956
00:48:13.513 --> 00:48:15.879
Lot of black folk
in the house tonight, uh-huh.


957
00:48:18.118 --> 00:48:21.281
And some tough women.
I heard a woman sing on that last one.


958
00:48:22.355 --> 00:48:24.550
That's okay, Ellen, strap-ons count.

959
00:48:24.658 --> 00:48:26.853
Just give me some good head

960
00:48:26.960 --> 00:48:30.418
And I boogie off
your down-home blues


961
00:48:39.573 --> 00:48:41.336
Thank y'all.

962
00:48:42.476 --> 00:48:43.807
Thank y'all.

963
00:48:43.910 --> 00:48:46.242
Right now, ladies and gentlemen,

964
00:48:46.346 --> 00:48:48.974
it's my extreme pleasure
to bring out this little motherfucker


965
00:48:49.082 --> 00:48:50.640
that just got out of rehab.

966
00:48:50.750 --> 00:48:54.151
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck. Fuck.

967
00:48:54.254 --> 00:48:56.017
Please welcome the one, the only--

968
00:48:56.123 --> 00:48:59.718
This is gonna be weird, man. Fuck. Geez.

969
00:49:05.065 --> 00:49:07.363
Fucking Alice is having
a fucking hissy fit.


970
00:49:07.467 --> 00:49:10.402
We always knew it could fucking
go wrong with him anyway.


971
00:49:10.504 --> 00:49:13.473
Alice! Alice!

972
00:49:15.208 --> 00:49:18.666
What the fuck is wrong
with you people? What?


973
00:49:18.778 --> 00:49:20.075
Every one of these hot dogs

974
00:49:20.180 --> 00:49:22.740
is supposed to have
brown German mustard on it!


975
00:49:22.849 --> 00:49:24.043
Brown German mustard!

976
00:49:24.151 --> 00:49:25.812
Look. It's on my rider.

977
00:49:25.919 --> 00:49:28.285
Look, it's on--
Where the fuck is it? It's on my rider.


978
00:49:28.388 --> 00:49:30.481
I had-
- Ah, there it is.

979
00:49:30.590 --> 00:49:32.148
Brown German mustard.

980
00:49:32.259 --> 00:49:34.819
I'm here alone!
I'm all alone in this place!


981
00:49:34.928 --> 00:49:37.556
Hey, where's the motherfuck
come over to help me, for fuck's sake?


982
00:49:37.664 --> 00:49:42.658
No blue M&Ms. No blue M&Ms!

983
00:49:42.769 --> 00:49:44.999
Not all blue M&Ms!

984
00:49:49.543 --> 00:49:50.635
Jimmy!

985
00:49:50.744 --> 00:49:52.769
Jimmy!

986
00:49:52.879 --> 00:49:55.643
- Jimmy!
- Hey, motherfucker, what the fuck are you--


987
00:49:55.749 --> 00:49:56.716
I can't go on.

988
00:49:56.816 --> 00:49:58.408
What the fuck are you yelling
about, motherfucker?


989
00:49:58.518 --> 00:50:01.009
- Get your damn ass out here.
- Who the fuck are you?


990
00:50:01.121 --> 00:50:03.055
- Who the fuck am l?
- Yeah.


991
00:50:03.156 --> 00:50:05.420
Who's blind around here,
you or me, motherfucker?


992
00:50:05.525 --> 00:50:07.516
Take a look. I'm Blind Melon Chitlin.

993
00:50:07.627 --> 00:50:10.619
- Blind Melon Chitlin?
- Yeah, I just introduced your ass out there.


994
00:50:10.730 --> 00:50:12.061
You're a god!

995
00:50:12.165 --> 00:50:13.792
You're a god. I worship you.

996
00:50:13.900 --> 00:50:15.094
You're a god.

997
00:50:15.202 --> 00:50:16.499
Let me suck your dick.

998
00:50:16.603 --> 00:50:18.264
Hey, hey, we don't have time.

999
00:50:22.209 --> 00:50:24.006
Alice! Alice!

1000
00:50:24.110 --> 00:50:25.805
Puto, puto.

1001
00:50:25.912 --> 00:50:27.743
They're calling "Alice, Alice, Alice."

1002
00:50:27.847 --> 00:50:29.314
- You know what that means?
- What?


1003
00:50:29.416 --> 00:50:32.146
That means you better get
your little skinny ass up there.


1004
00:50:32.252 --> 00:50:35.221
Or the motherfuckers are going to tear
this theater apart, you understand?


1005
00:50:35.322 --> 00:50:36.550
- l--
- They love you.


1006
00:50:36.656 --> 00:50:38.851
- Love me?
- They love you.


1007
00:50:38.959 --> 00:50:40.620
- They love you.
- They love me.


1008
00:50:40.727 --> 00:50:43.389
Yes. The music world loves you.

1009
00:50:43.496 --> 00:50:44.827
They-
- They need you.

1010
00:50:44.931 --> 00:50:46.922
- They do. They need me.
- They need you.


1011
00:50:47.033 --> 00:50:48.796
- Yeah.
- Get out there.


1012
00:50:48.902 --> 00:50:50.927
They need me, and they love me.

1013
00:50:51.037 --> 00:50:53.437
All right. All right, I'll do it, Blind.

1014
00:50:53.540 --> 00:50:55.565
- Go. Go.
- Let me suck your dick.


1015
00:50:55.675 --> 00:50:57.973
- No, no, we'll talk about that later.
- Okay.


1016
00:50:58.078 --> 00:50:59.045
I gotta get dressed.

1017
00:50:59.145 --> 00:51:01.306
I'll-
- Go introduce me again.

1018
00:51:01.414 --> 00:51:02.506
- Jimmy!
- Yeah, okay.


1019
00:51:02.616 --> 00:51:06.017
- Jimmy, go to--
- Introduce me again. I'm ready.


1020
00:51:12.259 --> 00:51:14.853
They love me. They need me.

1021
00:51:17.764 --> 00:51:20.824
Turn the motherfucker on, man.
Ladies and gentlemen--


1022
00:51:20.934 --> 00:51:23.095
They need me!

1023
00:51:23.203 --> 00:51:26.195
The one, the only Mr. Alice Bowie.

1024
00:51:26.306 --> 00:51:28.206
Here he is!

1025
00:51:28.308 --> 00:51:30.071
- Get his ass out here.

1026
00:51:59.439 --> 00:52:02.237
My mama talking to me
trying to tell me how to live


1027
00:52:04.778 --> 00:52:07.679
But I don't listen
to her 'cause my head is like a sieve


1028
00:52:15.488 --> 00:52:16.819
My daddy, he disowned me

1029
00:52:16.923 --> 00:52:18.823
'Cause I wear my sister's clothes

1030
00:52:20.727 --> 00:52:24.219
He caught me in the bathroom
with a pair of pantyhose


1031
00:52:31.471 --> 00:52:34.031
My basketball coach, he
done kicked me off the team


1032
00:52:36.142 --> 00:52:40.238
For wearing high-heeled sneakers
and acting like a queen


1033
00:53:03.002 --> 00:53:05.493
The world's coming to an end,
I don't even care


1034
00:53:08.074 --> 00:53:12.101
As long as I can have
a limo and my orange hair


1035
00:53:18.618 --> 00:53:22.281
And it don't bother me
if people think I'm funny


1036
00:53:24.224 --> 00:53:26.749
'Cause I'm a big rock star,
and I'm making lots of money


1037
00:53:26.860 --> 00:53:30.694
Money, money, money,
money, money, money


1038
00:53:35.668 --> 00:53:39.798
I'm so bloody rich.

1039
00:53:39.906 --> 00:53:43.899
I own apartment buildings
and shopping centers.


1040
00:53:45.245 --> 00:53:48.112
And I only know three chords.

1041
00:53:49.549 --> 00:53:51.608
Watch me!

1042
00:53:54.087 --> 00:53:55.952
You fools!

1043
00:54:51.578 --> 00:54:52.943
Hey, where-- where's Margaret, man?

1044
00:54:53.046 --> 00:54:54.513
Where'd she go? 
Where's Margaret?

1045
00:54:54.614 --> 00:54:56.741
I don't know where Margaret is.
She's in the bathroom. Jesus.


1046
00:54:58.751 --> 00:55:00.150
Hey.

1047
00:55:06.226 --> 00:55:08.387
Tutus come in handy in so many ways.

1048
00:55:08.495 --> 00:55:10.827
You know, not just
because they look good.


1049
00:55:10.930 --> 00:55:13.228
But if you walk into a certain spot,

1050
00:55:13.333 --> 00:55:15.563
the tutu will tell you
whether or not you can get out.


1051
00:55:15.668 --> 00:55:18.398
I'm back!

1052
00:55:18.505 --> 00:55:20.336
Few people know that.

1053
00:55:20.540 --> 00:55:21.564
Cheech and Chong!

1054
00:55:21.674 --> 00:55:23.005
Cheech and Chong!

1055
00:55:23.109 --> 00:55:24.872
Cheech and Chong!

1056
00:55:34.087 --> 00:55:36.282
Come on, Margaret,
where the hell are you?


1057
00:55:37.891 --> 00:55:40.223
Get out of that goddamn toilet
and get out here.


1058
00:55:40.326 --> 00:55:42.317
It's only a porno movie.

1059
00:55:42.428 --> 00:55:44.828
That looks exactly like my father.

1060
00:55:44.931 --> 00:55:47.365
That looks like one
of my ex-father-in-laws.


1061
00:55:47.467 --> 00:55:50.959
Christ. I never been
in a porno theater before.


1062
00:55:51.070 --> 00:55:54.233
Sure the hell smells weird.

1063
00:55:54.340 --> 00:55:56.365
Smells like wet puppy.

1064
00:55:58.077 --> 00:55:59.374
And what the hell's on the floor?

1065
00:55:59.479 --> 00:56:02.243
I keep sticking to the goddamn floor.

1066
00:56:03.716 --> 00:56:05.240
There's crap all over the seat.

1067
00:56:05.351 --> 00:56:08.115
There's something-
- Ew.

1068
00:56:09.989 --> 00:56:12.480
Well, this one ain't too bad.

1069
00:56:12.592 --> 00:56:14.560
You know, it's
the damnedest thing.


1070
00:56:14.661 --> 00:56:17.459
You know, you pay an arm and a leg
to get in these porno theaters,


1071
00:56:17.564 --> 00:56:21.295
and all they give you is a popcorn box
with the bottom cut out.


1072
00:56:21.401 --> 00:56:23.335
What the hell is this all about?

1073
00:56:23.436 --> 00:56:26.837
Well, there's a guy
got one on his lap.

1074
00:56:26.940 --> 00:56:30.569
And he's yanking on something,
that's for sure.


1075
00:56:30.677 --> 00:56:33.111
Margaret! Oh, there she is.

1076
00:56:33.212 --> 00:56:36.739
Margaret. Margaret.

1077
00:56:36.849 --> 00:56:39.784
Margaret, for Christ's sake, 
I'm over here.

1078
00:56:45.458 --> 00:56:48.859
Now, sit your ass down here.
We're gonna enjoy this.


1079
00:56:48.962 --> 00:56:51.556
I don't want to hear this bullshit.

1080
00:56:53.066 --> 00:56:55.091
What the hell's wrong with you now?

1081
00:56:55.201 --> 00:56:57.135
Well, I know there's
something on the seat.


1082
00:56:57.236 --> 00:56:58.897
That's why I didn't sit there.

1083
00:57:01.774 --> 00:57:03.969
Now, come on, sit down.
They're starting the movie.


1084
00:57:10.583 --> 00:57:13.143
Geez, I hope that's not the star.

1085
00:57:14.854 --> 00:57:18.551
She's uglier than your sister Ethel,
for Christ's sake.


1086
00:57:18.658 --> 00:57:20.853
No goddamn wonder. It is Ethel.

1087
00:57:20.960 --> 00:57:23.292
Margaret, that's
your horny sister Ethel up there.


1088
00:57:25.765 --> 00:57:29.257
Holy-- We wondered what
she'd been doing lately.


1089
00:57:29.369 --> 00:57:32.827
Looks like she's been doing a lot.

1090
00:57:32.939 --> 00:57:35.203
Well, just a minute.
She's taking off her clothes.


1091
00:57:36.643 --> 00:57:38.873
No, that ain't Ethel.

1092
00:57:43.816 --> 00:57:45.443
Oh, come on, lady,
what are you gonna do,


1093
00:57:45.551 --> 00:57:47.985
just stand there
with your finger in your muffin?


1094
00:57:49.989 --> 00:57:52.321
Boy, she's got a hell
of an itch, don't she?


1095
00:57:53.860 --> 00:57:57.227
Oh, those things stretch
a mile, don't they?


1096
00:57:57.330 --> 00:58:00.356
Hey, Margaret, she's smiling at you.

1097
00:58:02.669 --> 00:58:06.036
Look, she's doing impressions now.
Look at this.


1098
00:58:06.139 --> 00:58:08.539
There's Willie Nelson
eating ice cream.


1099
00:58:13.112 --> 00:58:16.081
Now, what the hell's she
got there, a Coke bottle?


1100
00:58:16.182 --> 00:58:18.582
What the hell is she gonna do--
Oh, for Christ's sake.


1101
00:58:20.687 --> 00:58:24.953
Margaret, look.
Things go better with Coke.


1102
00:58:26.459 --> 00:58:29.587
Whoa, the goddamn bottle disappeared.
You see that?


1103
00:58:29.696 --> 00:58:31.926
Oh, there it is.

1104
00:58:32.031 --> 00:58:34.090
Christ, she popped that
clear across the room.


1105
00:58:34.200 --> 00:58:35.462
Did you see that, Margaret?

1106
00:58:35.568 --> 00:58:39.265
Now, that's muscle control,
by Jesus.


1107
00:58:39.372 --> 00:58:40.361
Now what is that?

1108
00:58:40.473 --> 00:58:42.998
A big bowl of grapes?

1109
00:58:43.109 --> 00:58:47.409
What the hell is she gonna--
Well, for Christ's sake.


1110
00:58:47.513 --> 00:58:49.981
She's feeding it.

1111
00:58:50.083 --> 00:58:52.950
The furry little monkey eats grapes.
Look at that, Margaret.


1112
00:58:55.521 --> 00:58:58.957
How the hell is she gonna get them
out of there? That's what I want to see.


1113
00:58:59.058 --> 00:59:02.050
Oh, here they come.

1114
00:59:02.161 --> 00:59:05.790
Oh, Christ, she's
eating them. Oh, Jesus.


1115
00:59:05.898 --> 00:59:07.331
Are you getting sick?

1116
00:59:07.433 --> 00:59:09.867
Well, don't puke in your purse,
for Christ's sake.


1117
00:59:09.969 --> 00:59:12.233
Here, put your head
between your legs.


1118
00:59:12.338 --> 00:59:15.102
Oh, Christ, that might make you sicker.
Sit up here, Margaret.


1119
00:59:17.643 --> 00:59:19.338
If it's gonna make you sick,
don't look, okay?


1120
00:59:19.445 --> 00:59:21.276
I'll tell you when to look.

1121
00:59:21.380 --> 00:59:23.746
Margaret, look.

1122
00:59:23.850 --> 00:59:26.580
They brought in a midget.

1123
00:59:26.686 --> 00:59:29.849
He got a little bitty-
- Oh, no, he ain't.

1124
00:59:32.058 --> 00:59:36.495
That's the biggest goddamn
midget I've ever seen.


1125
00:59:36.596 --> 00:59:38.860
He's still coming in the door.

1126
00:59:40.500 --> 00:59:43.298
Margaret, look. 
He's going up on her.

1127
00:59:47.240 --> 00:59:50.539
He used it as a pole vault
to get up there. You see that?


1128
00:59:53.579 --> 00:59:56.275
Holy geez, he disappeared.

1129
00:59:56.382 --> 01:00:00.682
What the hell is that,
the Bermuda Triangle?


1130
01:00:00.787 --> 01:00:03.153
Oh, she popped him out, too.

1131
01:00:03.256 --> 01:00:07.317
And he's eating the goddamn
grapes. Oh, for Christ's sake.


1132
01:00:09.796 --> 01:00:13.857
Come on, buddy. If you're that hungry,
I'll buy you a hamburger.


1133
01:00:13.966 --> 01:00:18.198
Oh, Margaret, look, look, look.
They brought in a dog.


1134
01:00:18.304 --> 01:00:22.035
He licked that little midget clean.
You see that?


1135
01:00:22.141 --> 01:00:24.268
And he's eating the goddamn grapes.

1136
01:00:24.377 --> 01:00:26.845
Jesus Christ.

1137
01:00:26.946 --> 01:00:29.676
Oh, now they're getting sick.
Margaret, don't look at this.


1138
01:00:29.782 --> 01:00:32.546
They ruined the goddamn film.

1139
01:00:32.652 --> 01:00:34.950
I'm ready to go. 
You ready to go?

1140
01:00:35.054 --> 01:00:38.512
Now they brought in some black guy,
for Christ's sake.


1141
01:00:38.624 --> 01:00:41.058
Oh, Jesus.

1142
01:00:41.160 --> 01:00:43.993
Oh, shit.

1143
01:00:44.096 --> 01:00:47.827
Yeah, that's horrible.

1144
01:00:47.934 --> 01:00:49.959
Okay, Margaret, let's go. Come on.

1145
01:00:50.069 --> 01:00:51.866
When they start-
- Margaret.

1146
01:00:51.971 --> 01:00:53.700
Oh, get it, baby.

1147
01:00:53.806 --> 01:00:54.898
- Get it, baby.
- Ooh.


1148
01:00:55.007 --> 01:00:56.338
Yeah, get it, baby.

1149
01:00:56.442 --> 01:00:57.431
- Tear it up.
- Yeah.


1150
01:00:59.412 --> 01:01:02.313
Listen, God damn it, I'm leaving.
Are you coming?


1151
01:01:07.220 --> 01:01:10.383
Hey, man, you into old chicks?

1152
01:01:10.489 --> 01:01:12.753
Only if they got money, man.

1153
01:01:12.859 --> 01:01:16.488
And restore, please.
In the center, on Tommy.


1154
01:01:16.696 --> 01:01:18.561
Thank you.

1155
01:01:18.664 --> 01:01:21.656
If you're a stoner
in any way, shape, or form,


1156
01:01:21.767 --> 01:01:23.632
I would suggest you read the Bible

1157
01:01:23.736 --> 01:01:25.397
because I checked it out,

1158
01:01:25.504 --> 01:01:27.631
and I found out
that God is a stoner.

1159
01:01:27.740 --> 01:01:30.436
Oh, shit.

1160
01:01:30.543 --> 01:01:31.475
Fuck.

1161
01:01:31.577 --> 01:01:33.807
- My gun.
- Oh, hey, man.


1162
01:01:33.913 --> 01:01:35.642
First of all, the first page,

1163
01:01:35.748 --> 01:01:38.376
God is known as "the most high."

1164
01:01:40.286 --> 01:01:41.878
First page.

1165
01:01:41.988 --> 01:01:45.890
And when he created the heavens
and the earth and the universe,


1166
01:01:45.992 --> 01:01:51.692
on the sixth day,
God gave us green herb.


1167
01:01:51.797 --> 01:01:56.097
Now, what did He do
on the seventh day?


1168
01:01:56.202 --> 01:02:00.104
Nothing. He was too fucked up to work.

1169
01:02:01.774 --> 01:02:03.639
I'm gonna leave you here. 
You all right?

1170
01:02:03.743 --> 01:02:04.869
This is my dressing room.

1171
01:02:04.977 --> 01:02:06.239
Yep. Right here. Here you go.

1172
01:02:06.345 --> 01:02:08.779
And He turned Moses on.

1173
01:02:08.881 --> 01:02:11.213
And Moses talked to the burning bush.

1174
01:02:13.586 --> 01:02:16.555
I've done that.

1175
01:02:16.656 --> 01:02:19.216
God appeared to Moses
in the form of a burning bush.


1176
01:02:19.325 --> 01:02:21.088
That meant God had to be
the first dealer.


1177
01:02:21.193 --> 01:02:22.956
Of course He was. He's God.

1178
01:02:23.062 --> 01:02:24.996
And I can see God
on that mountain top right now.


1179
01:02:25.097 --> 01:02:26.564
He'd be all looking clean,

1180
01:02:26.666 --> 01:02:28.429
a little bling bling, looking around.

1181
01:02:28.534 --> 01:02:31.833
And He'd go, "Mo,
get your ass over here.

1182
01:02:31.938 --> 01:02:34.406
This bud's for Jews."

1183
01:02:42.181 --> 01:02:44.274
Oh, fuck.

1184
01:02:44.383 --> 01:02:47.079
They were looking
for the land of milk and honey.


1185
01:02:47.186 --> 01:02:49.518
The fuckers had the munchies.

1186
01:02:53.125 --> 01:02:56.561
I know that pot's good for you
because my cat loves to get high.


1187
01:02:57.797 --> 01:02:59.697
The first time I got my cat stoned,

1188
01:02:59.799 --> 01:03:03.030
I didn't mean to.
I just didn't see him in the room.


1189
01:03:03.135 --> 01:03:07.504
And I didn't realize he was stoned
till I watched him walk off a table.


1190
01:03:09.342 --> 01:03:11.810
And he didn't land on his feet.

1191
01:03:11.911 --> 01:03:13.401
No.

1192
01:03:13.512 --> 01:03:14.672
He took that one extra step

1193
01:03:14.780 --> 01:03:17.112
and he went all over
and started clawing shit.


1194
01:03:17.216 --> 01:03:18.774
Then he got hung up on one nail,

1195
01:03:18.884 --> 01:03:20.613
and he's hanging there looking at me.

1196
01:03:20.720 --> 01:03:23.154
He gives me that look
like "I'm okay. No, I'm--"


1197
01:03:26.058 --> 01:03:27.582
And he got loose.

1198
01:03:32.431 --> 01:03:34.524
Ohh!

1199
01:03:34.633 --> 01:03:36.328
This tastes like shit.

1200
01:03:36.435 --> 01:03:38.460
And I think he got
cotton mouth or something


1201
01:03:38.571 --> 01:03:40.300
because he looked up at me,
and he went--


1202
01:03:42.508 --> 01:03:44.669
I thought I was going deaf.

1203
01:03:44.777 --> 01:03:47.871
Then I realized he's fucked up.

1204
01:03:47.980 --> 01:03:50.710
So I had to give him
a little kitty drug test.


1205
01:03:50.816 --> 01:03:54.479
I threw him at the curtains,
and he didn't stick.


1206
01:03:54.587 --> 01:03:59.320
But he was so fucked up,
he's thinking, "Fuck, I'm flying, man."


1207
01:03:59.425 --> 01:04:01.450
Now, when I call my cat
in from outside,


1208
01:04:01.560 --> 01:04:03.050
I don't go "Kitty, kitty, kitty."

1209
01:04:03.162 --> 01:04:04.220
No, sir. No.

1210
01:04:04.330 --> 01:04:05.922
I make a little sound like--

1211
01:04:10.836 --> 01:04:14.863
He hears that sound,
he'll come running 50 miles away.


1212
01:04:14.974 --> 01:04:17.272
Then he'll follow me around
the rest of the night


1213
01:04:17.376 --> 01:04:18.968
like a little cat junkie, you know?

1214
01:04:21.614 --> 01:04:23.946
Fire it up.

1215
01:04:27.219 --> 01:04:29.847
Come on, man. I want to sit in the window
and look at shit.


1216
01:04:32.291 --> 01:04:34.020
Okay, throw me at the curtains.

1217
01:04:34.126 --> 01:04:35.855
I wasn't ready, man.

1218
01:04:37.897 --> 01:04:41.060
But right now, we'd
like to take you inside

1219
01:04:41.167 --> 01:04:44.534
a backyard of-- Well, let's
make it here in San Antonio.


1220
01:04:44.637 --> 01:04:47.970
Where we meet our heroes
Ralph and Herbie.


1221
01:05:13.933 --> 01:05:15.867
Ralph!

1222
01:05:15.968 --> 01:05:17.230
Herbie!

1223
01:05:17.336 --> 01:05:19.861
- I thought that was you.
- Hey, how the hell are you?


1224
01:05:19.972 --> 01:05:22.406
It's been a long time. How are you?

1225
01:05:22.508 --> 01:05:26.638
Hey, you're looking good, man.

1226
01:05:26.745 --> 01:05:28.303
You got a piercing.

1227
01:05:30.082 --> 01:05:31.913
How'd you do that, man?

1228
01:05:32.017 --> 01:05:34.076
I sat on a stapler about 15 times.

1229
01:05:34.186 --> 01:05:35.346
Wow.

1230
01:05:35.454 --> 01:05:36.978
It looks really punk, huh?

1231
01:05:37.089 --> 01:05:38.283
I like it, man.

1232
01:05:38.390 --> 01:05:39.687
It's so hip. I want to do it.

1233
01:05:39.792 --> 01:05:41.817
- You gotta show me how to do that.
- It's really easy.


1234
01:05:41.927 --> 01:05:43.224
Hey, I love your new haircut.

1235
01:05:43.329 --> 01:05:44.523
Really? Wow.

1236
01:05:44.630 --> 01:05:47.224
What's that? That's like
a reverse mohawk, huh?


1237
01:05:47.333 --> 01:05:49.233
Yeah.

1238
01:05:49.335 --> 01:05:50.461
Wow. I love how you got the hair

1239
01:05:50.569 --> 01:05:54.130
to stick straight out like a porcupine.

1240
01:05:54.240 --> 01:05:57.073
- I'm on a new vegetarian diet.
- Wow.


1241
01:05:57.176 --> 01:06:01.943
My human put me on it because he's trying
to help me get my shit together.


1242
01:06:02.047 --> 01:06:05.107
Thing is, man, with this new diet,
I have to shit every five minutes.


1243
01:06:05.217 --> 01:06:07.378
- Oh, that's--
- In fact, I gotta go right now.


1244
01:06:07.486 --> 01:06:09.215
- Oh, okay.
- Hey, do you want to help me?


1245
01:06:09.321 --> 01:06:11.118
Well, what do you want me to do?

1246
01:06:11.223 --> 01:06:13.953
Well, now that you ask,
will you lick my balls?


1247
01:06:24.036 --> 01:06:27.233
This reminds me of Waiting for Godot.

1248
01:06:30.176 --> 01:06:33.475
Oh, you got a big wad of gum in there.
I ain't licking that.


1249
01:06:33.579 --> 01:06:34.807
- No, no.
- Oh, come on, man.


1250
01:06:34.914 --> 01:06:36.279
No, no, you lick your own.
Lick your own.


1251
01:06:36.382 --> 01:06:37.679
Never mind, I'll do it myself.

1252
01:06:37.783 --> 01:06:39.341
Well, come on.
I need some paper, then.


1253
01:06:39.451 --> 01:06:40.918
Paper? What, are you
gonna read while you shit?


1254
01:06:41.020 --> 01:06:43.488
No. My human, he taught me
how to crap on paper.


1255
01:06:43.589 --> 01:06:44.749
It's the only way I can go now.

1256
01:06:44.857 --> 01:06:45.846
Oh, okay. Well, let me find--

1257
01:06:45.958 --> 01:06:47.949
Oh, here. Here's some.

1258
01:06:49.094 --> 01:06:50.823
Well, no, that's
a gum wrapper, man.


1259
01:06:50.930 --> 01:06:53.228
- I need a newspaper.
- Oh.


1260
01:06:53.332 --> 01:06:56.233
Give me the San Antonio
whatever the fuck they call it.


1261
01:07:02.575 --> 01:07:03.735
There you go. All right.

1262
01:07:03.842 --> 01:07:06.572
Oh, look, it's a picture
of Bush and Cheney.


1263
01:07:06.679 --> 01:07:09.671
Let them go.

1264
01:07:25.531 --> 01:07:28.398
Hey, Herbie, here it comes.

1265
01:07:28.500 --> 01:07:32.459
Oh, it's gonna be a big one, too.

1266
01:07:32.571 --> 01:07:35.734
Oh, looks like the log ride at Disneyland.

1267
01:07:35.841 --> 01:07:37.240
Keep pushing, keep pushing.

1268
01:07:37.343 --> 01:07:39.072
- You got it. Oh.
- Ow.


1269
01:07:39.178 --> 01:07:41.237
Wow, look at the size of that mother.

1270
01:07:41.347 --> 01:07:43.008
Whoa. Did I do that?

1271
01:07:43.115 --> 01:07:45.606
- Man, you're gonna need stitches.
- No kidding.


1272
01:07:45.718 --> 01:07:47.652
I could've used
an epidural for that one.


1273
01:07:47.753 --> 01:07:49.983
You should have heard
the sound when it hit the cement.


1274
01:07:50.089 --> 01:07:52.387
- Sounded like a ham. Boom.

1275
01:07:52.491 --> 01:07:54.618
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
- What's the matter? What's the matter?


1276
01:07:54.727 --> 01:07:56.217
- What's the matter?
- Fifi.


1277
01:07:56.328 --> 01:07:59.388
Fifi. Oh, she's in heat.

1278
01:07:59.498 --> 01:08:00.897
- Oh, God.
- Oh.


1279
01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:03.468
- Oh, that little poodle gets me so horny.
- No kidding, man.


1280
01:08:03.569 --> 01:08:05.059
- Oh, man, I just want to--
- Hey, knock it off.


1281
01:08:05.170 --> 01:08:06.467
Hey, hey, no, no. Hey!

1282
01:08:06.572 --> 01:08:08.335
Oh.

1283
01:08:08.440 --> 01:08:10.067
Knock it off!

1284
01:08:15.047 --> 01:08:17.015
I'm sorry. I don't
know what got into me.

1285
01:08:17.116 --> 01:08:19.050
Well, I know what got into me.

1286
01:08:21.520 --> 01:08:24.318
- Go ahead, get me back.
- Get out of here, you homo.


1287
01:08:26.091 --> 01:08:27.854
Ralph, Ralph.
Ralph, Ralph, Ralph.


1288
01:08:29.595 --> 01:08:32.029
Hey. Don't pay any attention
to her. I'll back her into you.


1289
01:08:32.131 --> 01:08:34.998
Hey, Fifi. How you doing?
Hey, where you been?


1290
01:08:35.100 --> 01:08:36.226
You been on vacation?

1291
01:08:36.335 --> 01:08:38.803
I like your new glasses.
Is that a new coat?


1292
01:08:38.904 --> 01:08:40.166
You look really good.

1293
01:08:40.272 --> 01:08:41.967
Hey, nice to see you. Here we go.

1294
01:08:42.074 --> 01:08:44.338
All right, I got her, got her.

1295
01:08:45.911 --> 01:08:48.573
No, no, no, not me! Not me!

1296
01:08:50.115 --> 01:08:53.846
Ladies and gentlemen,
give it up for Cheech and Chong.


1297
01:08:53.952 --> 01:08:56.750
And Shelby!

1298
01:08:58.824 --> 01:09:01.384
- Oh, good. I got to take a piss, man.
- Oh, yeah?


1299
01:09:10.269 --> 01:09:12.760
Here. Want some pop?

1300
01:09:20.446 --> 01:09:24.041
And out. Everybody out.

1301
01:09:27.319 --> 01:09:28.479
Yeah, it's wonderful.

1302
01:09:34.293 --> 01:09:37.558
Ready, pick them up.

1303
01:09:44.269 --> 01:09:47.261
Took a walk to the corner store

1304
01:09:47.373 --> 01:09:50.865
Just to buy a loaf of bread
and a box of s'mores


1305
01:09:50.976 --> 01:09:54.742
Up pulls a guy in a yellow van

1306
01:09:54.847 --> 01:09:58.044
A shiny gold badge flashes in his hand

1307
01:09:58.150 --> 01:10:01.813
- He said--
- All right, all you mojados, hit the floor.


1308
01:10:01.920 --> 01:10:06.357
I got one question
to ask and nothing more.

1309
01:10:06.458 --> 01:10:09.621
Answer in English. 
That is, if you can.

1310
01:10:10.662 --> 01:10:12.254
Where were you born, man?

1311
01:10:13.699 --> 01:10:16.600
Where was I born?

1312
01:10:16.702 --> 01:10:19.170
That's right, menudo breath,
read my lips.


1313
01:10:19.271 --> 01:10:21.796
Where were you born?

1314
01:10:21.907 --> 01:10:25.741
I was born in East L.A.

1315
01:10:25.844 --> 01:10:29.245
Man, I was born in East L.A.

1316
01:10:29.348 --> 01:10:32.317
Oh, you were born
in East L.A., were you?


1317
01:10:32.418 --> 01:10:34.477
I'm from East L.A.

1318
01:10:34.586 --> 01:10:35.985
Well, then, I guess you could tell me

1319
01:10:36.088 --> 01:10:37.749
who the new President
of the United States is.


1320
01:10:37.856 --> 01:10:38.880
What's his name?

1321
01:10:38.991 --> 01:10:40.253
The President.

1322
01:10:40.359 --> 01:10:41.417
That's right.

1323
01:10:41.527 --> 01:10:42.926
Oh, yeah, yeah, 
I know that guy.

1324
01:10:43.028 --> 01:10:44.120
The black guy. 
He just got elected.

1325
01:10:44.229 --> 01:10:45.423
His name is-
- He has a cool name.

1326
01:10:45.531 --> 01:10:48.625
It's like Arock-- Arock--
Arock Your Mama.


1327
01:10:48.734 --> 01:10:51.328
Rock Your Mama's the President.

1328
01:10:51.437 --> 01:10:53.098
Sorry, wrong answer.

1329
01:10:53.205 --> 01:10:55.400
You're under arrest, Pedro.
Come on, let's go.


1330
01:11:02.147 --> 01:11:05.048
One spot on Tommy and Shelby,
one spot on Cheech.


1331
01:11:05.150 --> 01:11:06.981
Keep them separate, there you go.

1332
01:11:07.085 --> 01:11:09.212
Good.

1333
01:11:14.760 --> 01:11:16.785
Next thing I know,
I'm in a foreign land


1334
01:11:16.895 --> 01:11:19.193
People talking so fast,
I couldn't understand


1335
01:11:19.298 --> 01:11:21.198
Nobody there to lend a helping hand

1336
01:11:21.300 --> 01:11:23.393
I was cold, it was dark,
it was a burger stand


1337
01:11:23.502 --> 01:11:25.800
I wanna go back to East L.A.

1338
01:11:25.904 --> 01:11:28.031
I wish I was back in East L.A.

1339
01:11:28.140 --> 01:11:30.301
I don't belong here in downtown TJ

1340
01:11:30.409 --> 01:11:32.604
'Cause I was born in East L.A.

1341
01:11:32.711 --> 01:11:34.702
I crawled under barbed wire,
swam across the stream


1342
01:11:34.813 --> 01:11:37.338
Went under six different trucks
packed like sardines


1343
01:11:37.449 --> 01:11:39.076
Walked all day in the burning sun

1344
01:11:39.184 --> 01:11:41.812
Now I know what it's like
to be born to run


1345
01:11:41.920 --> 01:11:44.115
Up ahead was the promised land

1346
01:11:44.223 --> 01:11:46.214
Shining like a star
just beyond my hand


1347
01:11:46.325 --> 01:11:48.293
All I could see was a golden glow

1348
01:11:48.393 --> 01:11:50.759
I looked up, the
sign said 5 zillion sold

1349
01:11:50.863 --> 01:11:53.559
And I was back in East L.A.

1350
01:11:53.665 --> 01:11:55.098
Back in East L.A.

1351
01:11:55.200 --> 01:11:57.566
You know I'm never gonna stray

1352
01:11:57.669 --> 01:11:59.796
'Cause I was born in East L.A.

1353
01:11:59.905 --> 01:12:01.566
Oh, L.A.

1354
01:12:01.673 --> 01:12:03.664
Too saltay

1355
01:12:03.775 --> 01:12:05.572
I'm proud to say

1356
01:12:05.677 --> 01:12:08.703
I'm from East L.A.

1357
01:12:29.501 --> 01:12:31.093
Let's hear it
for Tommy and Shelby Chong.


1358
01:12:31.203 --> 01:12:32.830
Come on.

1359
01:12:34.606 --> 01:12:36.039
Whoo!

1360
01:12:36.174 --> 01:12:39.575
I love being in San Antonio, man.

1361
01:12:43.015 --> 01:12:46.109
So we'd like to do something
very special tonight for you.


1362
01:12:46.218 --> 01:12:49.119
I hope you like it.
It's the only serious part of our whole show.


1363
01:12:49.221 --> 01:12:51.655
It's a song of my people.

1364
01:12:51.757 --> 01:12:53.691
And I hope you like it.

1365
01:12:55.527 --> 01:12:57.995
Mexican Americans

1366
01:12:58.096 --> 01:13:00.394
Don't like to just get into gang fights

1367
01:13:00.499 --> 01:13:05.698
They like flowers and music
and white girls named Debbie, too


1368
01:13:08.273 --> 01:13:11.037
Mexican Americans love education

1369
01:13:11.143 --> 01:13:14.078
So they go to night school
and they take Spanish


1370
01:13:14.179 --> 01:13:17.273
And get a "B"

1371
01:13:18.917 --> 01:13:20.407
Mexican Americans

1372
01:13:20.519 --> 01:13:22.919
Don't like to get up
early in the morning


1373
01:13:23.021 --> 01:13:28.755
But they have to,
so they do it real slow


1374
01:13:28.860 --> 01:13:31.727
Mexican Americans love their nanas

1375
01:13:31.830 --> 01:13:34.594
And their nonos and their ninas
and their ninos


1376
01:13:34.700 --> 01:13:38.227
Nanoo Nanoo ninanono

1377
01:13:39.605 --> 01:13:41.835
Don't call them beaners

1378
01:13:41.940 --> 01:13:43.464
They're all over the place

1379
01:13:43.575 --> 01:13:45.065
Don't call them beaners

1380
01:13:45.177 --> 01:13:47.008
They'll up and kick you in the face

1381
01:13:47.112 --> 01:13:48.875
Don't call them beaners

1382
01:13:48.981 --> 01:13:50.539
When they drown in their cologne

1383
01:13:50.649 --> 01:13:52.310
Don't call them beaners

1384
01:13:52.417 --> 01:13:54.180
Even though they're nice
when they're alone


1385
01:13:54.286 --> 01:13:56.220
Don't call them beaners

1386
01:13:56.321 --> 01:14:00.451
They don't like to be called beaners

1387
01:14:03.929 --> 01:14:07.956
You can dress him up,
but you can't take him out.


1388
01:14:08.066 --> 01:14:10.364
Where was l? Oh, yes. My people.

1389
01:14:10.469 --> 01:14:13.836
Mexican Americans are named Chata

1390
01:14:13.939 --> 01:14:16.601
And Chela and Chema

1391
01:14:16.708 --> 01:14:18.733
And little Chema

1392
01:14:18.844 --> 01:14:21.142
And have a son-in-law named Jeff

1393
01:14:24.116 --> 01:14:27.176
Mexican Americans don't
like to go to the movies


1394
01:14:27.285 --> 01:14:28.980
Where the dude has to
wear contact lenses


1395
01:14:29.087 --> 01:14:30.384
To make his blue eyes brown

1396
01:14:30.489 --> 01:14:34.050
'Cause don't they make
my brown eyes blue


1397
01:14:36.928 --> 01:14:39.089
Mexican Americans
live in Los Angeles


1398
01:14:39.197 --> 01:14:43.566
San Diego, San Francisco,
and San Antonio, Texas


1399
01:14:46.104 --> 01:14:51.132
And Jesus Christ, it's hot out there

1400
01:14:51.243 --> 01:14:54.371
Mexican Americans
have been here forever


1401
01:14:54.479 --> 01:14:56.276
And we're gonna be here forever

1402
01:14:56.381 --> 01:15:00.715
And we only want what's fair

1403
01:15:00.819 --> 01:15:04.186
Mexican Americans!

1404
01:15:07.259 --> 01:15:09.853
Thank you, Mexican Americans.

1405
01:15:10.028 --> 01:15:11.393
We want to sing
one more song for you.


1406
01:15:11.496 --> 01:15:13.464
We want you all to sing
along with us, okay?


1407
01:15:13.565 --> 01:15:15.294
It's a song I know you all know.

1408
01:15:15.400 --> 01:15:16.662
But if you don't know all the words,

1409
01:15:16.768 --> 01:15:18.793
they're gonna be right up here
on the big screen.


1410
01:15:18.904 --> 01:15:20.997
So join my partner, Mr. Tommy Chong,

1411
01:15:21.106 --> 01:15:22.164
and sing the following song.

1412
01:15:22.274 --> 01:15:23.673
Chengo?

1413
01:15:40.459 --> 01:15:43.257
Here's some marshmallows for you.

1414
01:15:50.102 --> 01:15:52.036
All right, come on, 
Mexican Americans.

1415
01:15:59.811 --> 01:16:01.108
All right.

1416
01:16:01.213 --> 01:16:03.181
Hey, how come you don't inhale, man?

1417
01:16:03.281 --> 01:16:04.714
I'm on probation.

1418
01:16:04.816 --> 01:16:06.681
All right, beaners. 
All the beaners.

1419
01:16:14.025 --> 01:16:14.992
Come on, beaners.

1420
01:16:44.756 --> 01:16:45.848
All right!

1421
01:16:52.798 --> 01:16:55.289
Everybody flip their phones on.
I want to see all those lights.


1422
01:16:55.400 --> 01:16:57.027
Come on, flick the phones on.

1423
01:17:02.474 --> 01:17:05.841
Come on in the balcony,
let me see them on.


1424
01:17:12.684 --> 01:17:15.278
All right, come on,
real loud, one more time.


1425
01:17:23.228 --> 01:17:25.253
One more time, real loud, everybody.

1426
01:17:56.962 --> 01:17:58.759
It's nice to be back. We love you.

1427
01:17:58.864 --> 01:18:00.627
Woo!

1428
01:18:00.732 --> 01:18:02.256
Yeah, dawg.

1429
01:18:02.367 --> 01:18:05.302
- Yeah, it's wonderful.
- One thumb way up.


1430
01:18:07.239 --> 01:18:09.571
Fist way up, way up there.

1431
01:18:09.674 --> 01:18:11.335
Calm down.

1432
01:18:11.443 --> 01:18:13.274
I love those guys.

1433
01:18:18.984 --> 01:18:20.212
Cheech and Chong!

1434
01:18:20.318 --> 01:18:21.945
Cheech and Chong!

1435
01:18:22.053 --> 01:18:23.577
Cheech and Chong!

1436
01:18:23.688 --> 01:18:25.383
Cheech and Chong!

1437
01:18:25.490 --> 01:18:27.014
Cheech and Chong!

1438
01:18:27.125 --> 01:18:28.786
Cheech and Chong!

1439
01:18:28.894 --> 01:18:30.794
Cheech and Chong!

1440
01:18:30.896 --> 01:18:32.420
Cheech and Chong!

1441
01:19:47.205 --> 01:19:48.433
Cheech and Chong!

1442
01:19:48.540 --> 01:19:49.939
Cheech and Chong!

1443
01:19:50.041 --> 01:19:51.633
Cheech and Chong!

1444
01:19:51.743 --> 01:19:53.301
Cheech and Chong!

1445
01:21:23.268 --> 01:21:24.826
- Ah.
- Oh, fuck.


1446
01:21:24.936 --> 01:21:26.870
This place is a trip, man.

1447
01:21:28.807 --> 01:21:30.434
Wow.

1448
01:21:30.542 --> 01:21:31.770
Ah.

1449
01:21:31.876 --> 01:21:34.003
San Antonio, man. I didn't
know I had so many cousins.


1450
01:21:34.112 --> 01:21:35.272
Oh, Jimmy.

1451
01:21:35.380 --> 01:21:36.312
Ooh, where'd you get that?

1452
01:21:36.414 --> 01:21:38.712
- Had my eye on it.

1453
01:21:38.817 --> 01:21:41.047
- Those yo-yos in the balcony threw it down.
- They threw it?


1454
01:21:41.152 --> 01:21:42.813
- And it made it all the way here?
- Yeah.


1455
01:21:42.921 --> 01:21:43.979
Way to go.

1456
01:21:44.089 --> 01:21:45.750
- Did you hear them yelling?
- Yeah.


1457
01:21:45.857 --> 01:21:49.122
When you were--
You were pretending to smoke a joint


1458
01:21:49.227 --> 01:21:50.353
and they were trying to help you out.

1459
01:21:50.462 --> 01:21:52.657
"Hey, here, smoke a real one."

1460
01:21:52.764 --> 01:21:54.527
No, I just heard what the guy said

1461
01:21:54.632 --> 01:21:57.328
when I was doing old man
in the park and you died.


1462
01:21:57.435 --> 01:22:00.632
"Run! Run!"

1463
01:22:00.738 --> 01:22:02.103
Good audience, man.

1464
01:22:02.207 --> 01:22:04.107
Good dope.

1465
01:22:04.209 --> 01:22:05.801
- Free.
- Good fans. Thank you.


1466
01:22:05.910 --> 01:22:08.003
- Where we going?
- I don't know. Next city.


1467
01:22:08.113 --> 01:22:09.740
- Where is that?
- I don't know.


1468
01:22:09.848 --> 01:22:11.213
I think it's still in Texas.

1469
01:22:11.316 --> 01:22:12.806
Let's go to the party.

1470
01:22:12.917 --> 01:22:14.942
- All right.
- What time's the party?


1471
01:22:15.053 --> 01:22:16.645
- Party's now.
- Where's the party?


1472
01:22:16.754 --> 01:22:18.551
In your mouth. 
Everybody's coming.

1473
01:22:18.656 --> 01:22:22.057
- Oh, that's so funny.
- Hey, which way? Come on, man.


1474
01:22:22.160 --> 01:22:24.458
I don't know, man. Ow. Fuck.

1475
01:22:24.562 --> 01:22:25.927
Look. Hey, there's a door.

1476
01:22:26.030 --> 01:22:27.429
Well, there's no door handle.

1477
01:22:27.532 --> 01:22:29.056
Well, open it, man.

1478
01:22:29.167 --> 01:22:30.566
There's no door handle.

1479
01:22:30.668 --> 01:22:33.034
Stick your dick in it.
Use it as a crowbar.


1480
01:22:33.138 --> 01:22:35.038
- Hello!

1481
01:22:35.140 --> 01:22:36.937
- Hey!
- Hey, we're locked in here!


1482
01:22:37.041 --> 01:22:39.168
- Hello!
- Hey, quit banging, man.


1483
01:22:39.277 --> 01:22:41.302
- I'm trying to hear.
- Well, excuse me.


1484
01:22:41.412 --> 01:22:43.243
- Okay.
- Okay, put your head right up next to it.


1485
01:22:43.348 --> 01:22:46.647
- Hey! Hey! Hey!

1486
01:22:46.751 --> 01:22:48.685
Okay, this isn't funny anymore.

1487
01:22:48.786 --> 01:22:51.448
- Hello! Hey, we're locked in here!
- Hey!


1488
01:22:51.556 --> 01:22:53.183
It's Cheech and Chong!
