00:00:19.395 --> 00:00:20.771
<i>Since the dawn of time...</i>

2
00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:25.317
<i>...storytellers have enchanted
audiences with their words.</i>


3
00:00:25.485 --> 00:00:28.528
<i>But there is an even rarer gift:</i>

4
00:00:28.696 --> 00:00:32.032
<i>There are those,
who by reading out loud...</i>


5
00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:35.619
...can bring characters to life.

6
00:00:35.787 --> 00:00:39.498
<i>Out of books and into our world.</i>

7
00:00:39.666 --> 00:00:43.001
Go to sleep now. Shh.
Go to sleep, baby girl.


8
00:00:43.169 --> 00:00:46.380
- Maybe this will work. Let me read to her.
She's too young.


9
00:00:46.547 --> 00:00:48.465
- No.
- Shh.


10
00:00:48.633 --> 00:00:50.300
Why don't you read to me?

11
00:00:54.639 --> 00:00:57.266
"Once upon a time,
there was a dear little girl...


12
00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:00.143
...who was loved
by everyone who met her...


13
00:01:00.311 --> 00:01:04.439
...but especially by her grandmother,
who would've given her anything.


14
00:01:05.233 --> 00:01:11.405
Once she gave her
a little hood of red velvet."


15
00:01:12.365 --> 00:01:13.365
What was that?

16
00:01:16.327 --> 00:01:17.911
What?

17
00:01:19.497 --> 00:01:21.707
I don't know. Nothing.

18
00:01:26.045 --> 00:01:29.506
"Red velvet that suited her so well...

19
00:01:29.674 --> 00:01:32.509
...that she refused to wear
anything instead of it.


20
00:01:32.677 --> 00:01:36.805
So she was called
Little Red Riding Hood."


21
00:01:38.516 --> 00:01:41.476
Most of these Silvertongues,
as they are known...


22
00:01:41.644 --> 00:01:43.687
...prefer to keep their skills a secret.

23
00:01:43.855 --> 00:01:47.232
But some do not even know
that this gift is theirs...


24
00:01:48.192 --> 00:01:50.068
...until it is too late.

25
00:02:05.418 --> 00:02:08.420
Is this the right way?
Next turn on the left.


26
00:02:08.588 --> 00:02:10.756
Are you sure?
Because I think we missed it.


27
00:02:10.923 --> 00:02:12.716
Who's the driver? Dad.

28
00:02:12.884 --> 00:02:15.218
Who's the navigator? Me.

29
00:02:15.386 --> 00:02:17.763
- Have I ever got us lost before?
- No.


30
00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:19.306
No.

31
00:02:19.474 --> 00:02:21.600
Oh, hey. Look, a Sasquatch.

32
00:02:22.018 --> 00:02:24.770
Hey! Oh, the turning, left, left, left!

33
00:02:41.079 --> 00:02:45.290
The Alpine Antiquarian Bookshop
should be at the end of this street...


34
00:02:45.458 --> 00:02:47.626
...and on the right-hand
side of the square.


35
00:02:47.794 --> 00:02:49.336
Good.

36
00:02:49.504 --> 00:02:52.756
By the way, how come every bookshop
we go to is a thousand years old?


37
00:02:52.924 --> 00:02:56.760
Why can't we go to one that sells hot
chocolate and books that are actually new?


38
00:02:56.928 --> 00:02:59.805
What good would a bookbinder
like me be in a new bookstore?


39
00:02:59.972 --> 00:03:04.893
- I love old books. The marbled pages...
- End papers, the leather binding...


40
00:03:05.686 --> 00:03:07.813
This is my kind of place.

41
00:03:09.315 --> 00:03:12.484
- Maybe you'll find it here, Mo.
- Find what?


42
00:03:12.652 --> 00:03:14.903
That book you're always looking for.

43
00:03:15.655 --> 00:03:18.990
- I'm not looking for anything particular.
You don't think I've noticed?


44
00:03:19.158 --> 00:03:22.202
You never leave a bookshop unless
you've checked every corner.


45
00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:26.373
- Don't we?
- No, you always come away disappointed.


46
00:03:26.958 --> 00:03:30.043
Sometimes your eyes
are even a little red.


47
00:03:30.211 --> 00:03:32.421
It's because old books are dusty.

48
00:03:33.673 --> 00:03:35.966
Hey, look, Harriet the Spy.

49
00:03:36.134 --> 00:03:38.009
I'm going inside. 
You want to come?

50
00:03:38.177 --> 00:03:41.138
- The Secret Garden!
- Or I guess you could stay here.


51
00:04:03.828 --> 00:04:06.621
Afternoon. I'm Mortimer Folchart.

52
00:04:07.415 --> 00:04:09.458
Ah! The famous book doctor.

53
00:04:10.543 --> 00:04:13.044
Well, you're just in time.

54
00:04:13.504 --> 00:04:14.546
Look at this poor patient.

55
00:04:14.714 --> 00:04:17.048
- Uh-oh.
- Do you think we can save him?


56
00:04:17.216 --> 00:04:19.176
- I think the prognosis is good.
- Excellent.


57
00:04:20.887 --> 00:04:23.346
- Quite the collection you have.
- Yes.


58
00:04:23.514 --> 00:04:26.766
- If you'd like to look around, be my guest.
- Thank you.


59
00:04:37.278 --> 00:04:39.738
<i>Fine, intelligent eye.</i>

60
00:04:39.906 --> 00:04:42.407
<i>What do you say to calling him
Black Beauty?</i>


61
00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:47.037
<i>Oh, my dear child.</i>

62
00:04:49.749 --> 00:04:50.916
<i>Imagine, Heidi.</i>

63
00:04:51.083 --> 00:04:54.085
<i>Capricorn's men were looking
for Dustfinger in the wrong place.</i>


64
00:04:54.253 --> 00:04:55.921
<i>Southwest end of Treasure Island.</i>

65
00:04:56.088 --> 00:04:58.423
<i>He hadn't left the village.</i>

66
00:04:59.383 --> 00:05:01.593
<i>He hadn't even tried.</i>

67
00:05:04.764 --> 00:05:07.849
<i>Dustfinger was in Basta's house.</i>

68
00:05:08.643 --> 00:05:12.562
<i>What is that? Coming over
the hill? It's a beast of some kind!</i>


69
00:05:39.549 --> 00:05:41.258
Dustfinger.

70
00:05:46.264 --> 00:05:48.640
He doesn't like to be tickled.

71
00:05:49.642 --> 00:05:51.309
And you should be more careful.

72
00:05:51.978 --> 00:05:53.353
His name's Gwin.

73
00:05:53.521 --> 00:05:55.313
And I know he looks charming...

74
00:05:55.940 --> 00:05:59.150
...but you know what they say
about books and covers.


75
00:06:05.074 --> 00:06:07.325
Uh... Yeah, I do.

76
00:06:07.493 --> 00:06:10.412
I also know what they say about
talking to strangers. Excuse me.


77
00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:12.789
But I'm not a stranger, Meggie.

78
00:06:13.833 --> 00:06:17.419
You won't remember me, we only
met once, and you were quite small.


79
00:06:17.837 --> 00:06:19.963
But I'm no stranger.

80
00:06:23.676 --> 00:06:24.926
Hello, Silvertongue.

81
00:06:26.512 --> 00:06:29.347
I was just having a talk
with your daughter.


82
00:06:29.849 --> 00:06:32.267
Meggie, go wait for me in the van.

83
00:06:32.810 --> 00:06:34.185
It's all right, he's a friend.

84
00:06:34.353 --> 00:06:36.813
- Dad.
- Do it now!


85
00:06:41.319 --> 00:06:43.862
Let's you and me
go for a little walk.

86
00:06:54.081 --> 00:06:56.166
I've been looking for you.

87
00:06:56.334 --> 00:06:58.668
I've been one step behind you for years.

88
00:06:59.503 --> 00:07:02.547
Waiting for you to find what it is
you've been searching for.


89
00:07:02.715 --> 00:07:05.050
Just tell me what you want.

90
00:07:05.217 --> 00:07:08.553
I want you to put right
the wrong you did 9 years ago.


91
00:07:08.721 --> 00:07:12.140
And I'm here to warn you,
Capricorn knows where you're staying.


92
00:07:12.308 --> 00:07:15.977
His men are there now waiting for you
and your daughter to come home.


93
00:07:16.145 --> 00:07:18.730
- He wants you to read for him.
- Well, he's out of luck.


94
00:07:18.898 --> 00:07:21.107
I don't read aloud anymore.

95
00:07:21.734 --> 00:07:26.029
If he finds you, you really think
you'll have a choice?


96
00:07:34.246 --> 00:07:38.166
I could help you
stay hidden, but I won't.

97
00:07:38.334 --> 00:07:42.087
Not unless you promise to send me home.
I've been here too long.


98
00:07:42.713 --> 00:07:44.964
Send me home, Silvertongue.

99
00:07:45.591 --> 00:07:48.218
- Read to me.
- I'm sorry, I can't help you.


100
00:07:48.761 --> 00:07:51.137
It's too dangerous. 
It's uncontrollable.

101
00:07:51.305 --> 00:07:54.933
If you won't help me, I'll find
someone who can. Just give me the book.


102
00:07:55.226 --> 00:07:57.268
What book? I don't have the book.

103
00:07:58.104 --> 00:08:00.271
- You don't have the book?
- No.


104
00:08:00.773 --> 00:08:03.066
I've searched everywhere. 
I don't have it.

105
00:08:03.609 --> 00:08:04.734
What's in the bag?

106
00:08:08.572 --> 00:08:10.031
Did you finally find one?

107
00:08:10.199 --> 00:08:14.119
It's funny, isn't it? Strange, my turning
up here right at that very moment.


108
00:08:15.121 --> 00:08:18.790
You know, there are times in life
when the stars just simply align.


109
00:08:18.958 --> 00:08:20.959
But this is not one of those times!

110
00:08:26.298 --> 00:08:27.590
Dad!

111
00:08:37.309 --> 00:08:38.852
- Meggie!
- What's happening?


112
00:08:39.019 --> 00:08:41.771
I told you to
stay in the van! Run!

113
00:08:45.276 --> 00:08:46.317
Get in, get in!

114
00:08:49.613 --> 00:08:50.655
Come on. Start!

115
00:08:55.870 --> 00:08:58.455
Stop! I'm trying to help you!

116
00:09:05.296 --> 00:09:08.089
- What are you doing? Leave it alone.
- I want to see the book!


117
00:09:08.257 --> 00:09:10.175
You're not to touch that book,
understand?


118
00:09:10.342 --> 00:09:12.510
I don't understand.
I don't understand at all.


119
00:09:12.845 --> 00:09:15.972
What is that book? Why did the freaky man
with the scars want it?


120
00:09:16.140 --> 00:09:18.850
- Why did he call you Silvertongue?
- I can't tell you.


121
00:09:19.018 --> 00:09:22.145
- You have to tell me.
- No. I have to protect you.


122
00:09:22.313 --> 00:09:23.688
And your mother.

123
00:09:24.523 --> 00:09:27.776
My mother? What has this
got to do with my mother?


124
00:09:28.694 --> 00:09:30.612
Meggie, please just...

125
00:09:33.657 --> 00:09:34.824
I'm scared, Mo.

126
00:09:37.328 --> 00:09:39.913
Meggie, I'm going to take care of you.

127
00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:42.373
I always have, and I always will.

128
00:09:44.210 --> 00:09:45.835
At least tell me where we're going.

129
00:09:46.170 --> 00:09:47.378
We're going to Italy.

130
00:09:48.005 --> 00:09:52.217
You have a great aunt there.
It's very important that we get there. Okay?


131
00:09:52.384 --> 00:09:55.720
Please, Meggie. 
No more questions.

132
00:10:33.884 --> 00:10:36.469
So she's friendly,
this great aunt of mine?


133
00:10:36.637 --> 00:10:37.762
You'll like her.

134
00:10:39.598 --> 00:10:43.309
Would you please
stop ringing that damn bell!


135
00:10:43.769 --> 00:10:46.646
After a while.
She's kind of an acquired taste.


136
00:10:46.814 --> 00:10:48.022
Right.

137
00:10:48.482 --> 00:10:49.858
What?

138
00:10:50.568 --> 00:10:51.860
Elinor.

139
00:10:52.611 --> 00:10:54.946
Well, for the love of Thomas Hardy.

140
00:10:55.990 --> 00:10:59.409
I'm so glad you've finally made
your way back here, Mortimer.


141
00:10:59.577 --> 00:11:02.120
My poor books
are in a terrible state of disrepair.


142
00:11:02.288 --> 00:11:04.122
Don't worry. I'll take care of it.

143
00:11:04.290 --> 00:11:07.125
Don't play with your food, child.
You're not a toddler.


144
00:11:07.293 --> 00:11:09.294
Look at her, she's as thin
as a soap bubble.


145
00:11:11.213 --> 00:11:13.798
Oh, she so reminds me
of her mother.


146
00:11:14.133 --> 00:11:17.218
Not just when she opens her mouth,
if she ever does. Speaking of...


147
00:11:17.386 --> 00:11:19.637
We haven't heard from her,
if that's what you mean.


148
00:11:19.805 --> 00:11:20.930
Oh, well, no matter.

149
00:11:21.098 --> 00:11:24.225
I grew up without a mother.
Didn't do me any damage whatsoever.


150
00:11:25.144 --> 00:11:29.272
No, my mother just suddenly dashed off
on safari one day and never came back.


151
00:11:31.317 --> 00:11:34.861
It's what the women in our family
seem to do, they just go off on adventures.


152
00:11:35.029 --> 00:11:37.196
Not me, I prefer
to stay where I am.

153
00:11:37.364 --> 00:11:39.157
But your mother...

154
00:11:39.700 --> 00:11:41.492
Well, she wanted the real thing.

155
00:11:42.161 --> 00:11:43.870
My mum wanted me.

156
00:11:44.038 --> 00:11:46.497
And then one day she was gone,
without explanation.


157
00:11:46.665 --> 00:11:50.168
- Is that what you call an adventure?
- No, that's what I call abandonment.


158
00:11:55.007 --> 00:11:56.215
Well done, Elinor.

159
00:11:56.383 --> 00:11:58.384
Oh, well, you know it's the truth.

160
00:12:00.888 --> 00:12:02.347
Mum did not abandon us.

161
00:12:02.514 --> 00:12:04.933
No. No, she didn't.

162
00:12:05.184 --> 00:12:07.477
Well, then what really happened to her?

163
00:12:09.521 --> 00:12:13.524
- I'm not a child anymore. I'm all grown up.
- Almost.


164
00:12:13.692 --> 00:12:16.736
Enough to know the most important thing
that's ever happened to me.


165
00:12:16.904 --> 00:12:19.530
Don't you think I've realized
why I'm not in regular school?


166
00:12:19.698 --> 00:12:22.575
And why we're always
traveling around from place to place?


167
00:12:24.870 --> 00:12:27.580
All these years
you've been looking for Mum.


168
00:12:27.748 --> 00:12:31.459
And that book, but I just don't
understand how those two things...


169
00:12:31.627 --> 00:12:33.127
Meggie.

170
00:12:34.254 --> 00:12:36.881
You have to tell me something.

171
00:12:42.596 --> 00:12:45.306
- I write about her sometimes.
- You do?


172
00:12:45.474 --> 00:12:46.975
Yeah. I make up stories about...

173
00:12:47.142 --> 00:12:50.895
You make up stories? Meggie, you know
I don't want you doing that.


174
00:12:52.898 --> 00:12:54.565
But I have to.

175
00:12:55.275 --> 00:12:57.819
I feel like the words bring her
back to me.


176
00:12:59.029 --> 00:13:00.446
Yeah.

177
00:13:01.407 --> 00:13:03.116
The written word.

178
00:13:04.410 --> 00:13:05.743
It's a powerful thing.

179
00:13:06.704 --> 00:13:08.162
You have to be careful with it.

180
00:13:10.874 --> 00:13:12.875
Do you think we'll ever see her again?

181
00:13:15.421 --> 00:13:17.255
I hope we do, Meggie.

182
00:13:20.050 --> 00:13:21.467
I hope we do.

183
00:14:16.899 --> 00:14:19.108
Step away from that case!
Three steps back!


184
00:14:20.986 --> 00:14:23.071
What are you doing?
This place is not for children.


185
00:14:23.238 --> 00:14:25.156
I thought I made that clear.
Come on, out.


186
00:14:25.324 --> 00:14:27.992
I'm sorry, I was just looking
for a book to read.


187
00:14:28.327 --> 00:14:29.494
Is that a nose print?

188
00:14:30.162 --> 00:14:34.165
Do you have any idea
how valuable this manuscript is?


189
00:14:34.333 --> 00:14:35.958
Yes, I know.

190
00:14:36.126 --> 00:14:37.293
Oh, you know, do you?

191
00:14:37.836 --> 00:14:39.420
It's Persian, isn't it?

192
00:14:39.797 --> 00:14:41.506
I can tell from the illuminations...

193
00:14:41.673 --> 00:14:44.675
...the pinks and the blues
and the gold-patterned background.


194
00:14:45.010 --> 00:14:48.179
Maybe from the late 12th century or so?

195
00:14:49.014 --> 00:14:51.349
Goodness me, what a little know-it-all.

196
00:14:51.683 --> 00:14:52.683
It's beautiful.

197
00:14:54.144 --> 00:14:57.772
Yes, it is, isn't it?
But I just adore everything Persian.


198
00:14:57.940 --> 00:15:00.441
- You've been to Persia, then?
- Yes, a hundred times.


199
00:15:00.609 --> 00:15:05.363
Along with St. Petersburg, Paris,
Middle Earth, distant planets and Shangri-la.


200
00:15:05.531 --> 00:15:07.156
And I never had to leave this room.

201
00:15:07.324 --> 00:15:12.120
Books are adventure. They contain murder
and mayhem and passion.


202
00:15:13.872 --> 00:15:15.665
They love anyone who opens them.

203
00:15:17.751 --> 00:15:20.837
If I promise not to touch anything...

204
00:15:21.380 --> 00:15:24.215
...could I maybe just sit
and read in here for a while?


205
00:15:27.719 --> 00:15:30.471
That was the window seat
where she used to curl up and read.


206
00:15:30.889 --> 00:15:32.306
She?

207
00:15:36.228 --> 00:15:37.228
Your mother.

208
00:15:38.564 --> 00:15:41.065
Your father used to read to her here.

209
00:15:43.193 --> 00:15:44.902
This was hers.

210
00:15:46.321 --> 00:15:49.323
If I find even a bookmark out of place,
I'll lock this room up...


211
00:15:49.491 --> 00:15:53.077
...and you'll never see the inside
of it again, that I can promise you.


212
00:16:20.355 --> 00:16:23.274
<i>Then Dorian Gray half opened the door.</i>

213
00:16:24.776 --> 00:16:26.277
<i>As he did so...</i>

214
00:17:09.780 --> 00:17:11.322
<i>Farewell...</i>

215
00:17:11.490 --> 00:17:12.615
<i>Trapped inside...</i>

216
00:17:14.826 --> 00:17:15.910
<i>Desire of revenge...</i>

217
00:17:27.339 --> 00:17:28.631
I tried to warn you.

218
00:17:30.425 --> 00:17:34.303
I gave you every opportunity
to help me, but you refused.


219
00:17:35.138 --> 00:17:38.182
All you had to do was read me back.
You could have kept the book.


220
00:17:38.809 --> 00:17:40.017
But you had to run.

221
00:17:40.352 --> 00:17:42.520
So I turned to Capricorn.

222
00:17:43.480 --> 00:17:45.856
- What?
- He's promised to help me.


223
00:17:46.024 --> 00:17:47.650
What have you done?

224
00:17:50.654 --> 00:17:52.071
Meggie!

225
00:18:03.208 --> 00:18:06.210
There are men outside!
They're trying to break into the house!


226
00:18:22.644 --> 00:18:24.186
Meggie!

227
00:18:29.401 --> 00:18:30.443
Mo, look out!

228
00:18:33.196 --> 00:18:34.864
Mortimer, my books!

229
00:18:36.783 --> 00:18:38.409
Hello, Silvertongue.

230
00:18:38.577 --> 00:18:40.077
- Basta?
- Did you miss me?


231
00:18:40.495 --> 00:18:41.537
Stop!

232
00:18:42.664 --> 00:18:44.915
Oh, you illiterate cretins!
Hold him!


233
00:18:45.083 --> 00:18:47.168
These are masterpieces
you're destroying!


234
00:18:47.336 --> 00:18:50.755
Masterpieces, you ignorant halfwit!

235
00:18:53.050 --> 00:18:56.093
Stop!
I swear, I'll kill every last one of you!


236
00:18:56.261 --> 00:18:58.429
You know I could!
It would take a few words!


237
00:18:58.597 --> 00:19:02.350
Oh, we won't have to worry about
your words if we cut out your tongue!


238
00:19:02.517 --> 00:19:05.519
You remember my calling card,
don't you?


239
00:19:05.687 --> 00:19:06.937
One, two, three!

240
00:19:07.105 --> 00:19:09.065
If that doesn't work...

241
00:19:10.108 --> 00:19:12.693
...well, there's always your daughter.

242
00:19:16.114 --> 00:19:18.366
- Get off me!
- No one gets hurt.


243
00:19:18.533 --> 00:19:19.950
Yes, the fire! The fire.

244
00:19:20.118 --> 00:19:22.953
Isn't that what we agreed?
Isn't that what we agreed?


245
00:19:23.121 --> 00:19:25.790
Yes, we agreed, we agreed, we agreed!

246
00:19:28.460 --> 00:19:31.379
Evil spirits, I repel thee.
Evil spirits, I repel thee!


247
00:19:31.546 --> 00:19:32.963
Dad! Dad!

248
00:19:33.131 --> 00:19:35.132
Right, get them in the van.

249
00:19:35.300 --> 00:19:37.927
- You're not taking them too.
- Capricorn's orders.


250
00:19:38.095 --> 00:19:41.055
After all, we are going
to require a little leverage...


251
00:19:42.432 --> 00:19:43.557
...to make Daddy read.

252
00:19:44.643 --> 00:19:46.227
Meggie!

253
00:19:47.896 --> 00:19:52.608
Don't drag my daughter into this.
For God's sakes, she's just a child.


254
00:19:53.151 --> 00:19:54.443
- No, don't! No!
- What's this?


255
00:19:54.611 --> 00:19:56.320
- No.
- My only hope of finding my wife.


256
00:19:56.488 --> 00:19:57.988
- My only hope of going home!
- No!


257
00:19:58.156 --> 00:20:00.491
What is it? When will you
tell me what is going on?


258
00:20:00.659 --> 00:20:03.994
Has your father ever read you
a bedtime story, Meggie?


259
00:20:04.162 --> 00:20:06.664
- You might want to ask him why.
- Give me this.


260
00:20:08.291 --> 00:20:09.625
I'll take that!

261
00:20:16.133 --> 00:20:17.174
No!

262
00:20:17.342 --> 00:20:19.718
Oh, my books! No!

263
00:20:19.886 --> 00:20:22.012
Come along, now. Hurry up.

264
00:20:24.015 --> 00:20:26.058
Oh, my books!

265
00:20:29.187 --> 00:20:30.354
Come on!

266
00:20:55.964 --> 00:20:57.590
Meggie.

267
00:21:04.389 --> 00:21:06.307
Where are we?

268
00:21:34.836 --> 00:21:36.420
They're here.

269
00:21:37.589 --> 00:21:40.049
Hey, they're coming!

270
00:22:03.782 --> 00:22:05.115
Oh, how lovely.

271
00:22:05.659 --> 00:22:06.951
After you.

272
00:22:07.786 --> 00:22:09.870
Come on, out! Out!

273
00:22:10.455 --> 00:22:11.914
Oh, they're rude!

274
00:22:14.709 --> 00:22:17.753
Move! Move!

275
00:22:28.682 --> 00:22:30.140
It's ticking.

276
00:22:43.947 --> 00:22:46.156
Flying monkeys.

277
00:22:54.082 --> 00:22:55.749
- What is this place?
- I don't know.


278
00:22:55.917 --> 00:22:57.293
Welcome to our humble abode.

279
00:22:57.460 --> 00:22:59.253
- Enjoy your stay.
- Go on!


280
00:22:59.421 --> 00:23:03.007
No, I will not share this filthy hovel
with all those creatures!


281
00:23:03.174 --> 00:23:05.050
Go on, get in!

282
00:23:05.218 --> 00:23:06.260
In you go!

283
00:23:10.348 --> 00:23:12.349
What are we doing here, Mortimer?

284
00:23:14.185 --> 00:23:16.645
Where did those monsters come from?

285
00:23:18.481 --> 00:23:19.523
Books.

286
00:23:22.527 --> 00:23:23.986
They came out of books.

287
00:23:24.154 --> 00:23:25.529
What are you talking about?

288
00:23:25.697 --> 00:23:30.534
Mortimer, be quick, be clear,
or I swear I'll disinherit you.


289
00:23:33.538 --> 00:23:36.874
Came out of books? 
What do you mean?

290
00:23:39.210 --> 00:23:40.711
Come here.

291
00:23:46.676 --> 00:23:47.718
Meggie...

292
00:23:49.429 --> 00:23:52.056
...this is the story
you have been waiting to hear.


293
00:23:53.516 --> 00:23:57.478
Elinor, you were away at a book fair...

294
00:23:57.646 --> 00:24:02.566
...and we were housesitting for you.
Me, Meggie, your mum.


295
00:24:05.320 --> 00:24:07.696
<i>And that night we were in the library...</i>

296
00:24:09.074 --> 00:24:11.575
<i>...so I opened a copy
of a book we'd just bought.</i>


297
00:24:12.702 --> 00:24:14.010
Inkheart.

298
00:24:15.387 --> 00:24:16.387
Inkheart.

299
00:24:17.874 --> 00:24:20.584
<i>It was a good read.
Full of adventure and magic...</i>


300
00:24:21.920 --> 00:24:24.713
<i>...and a creature called The Shadow.
Terrifying.</i>


301
00:24:25.090 --> 00:24:27.424
<i>I read several chapters aloud
and nothing happened.</i>


302
00:24:30.553 --> 00:24:32.429
<i>Then they appeared, out of nowhere...</i>

303
00:24:33.056 --> 00:24:36.433
<i>...from the medieval world of the book.
At first it was Capricorn...</i>


304
00:24:37.936 --> 00:24:41.063
<i>...a thuggish bandit
working for an evil duke.</i>


305
00:24:49.114 --> 00:24:53.200
<i>Then Basta, his knife-wielding sidekick.</i>

306
00:24:55.412 --> 00:24:57.579
<i>And then Dustfinger...</i>

307
00:24:58.915 --> 00:25:02.126
<i>...a traveling fire juggler
with magical powers.</i>


308
00:25:04.838 --> 00:25:06.130
My voice brought them out.

309
00:25:06.631 --> 00:25:09.091
Your voice brought them out
of the book?


310
00:25:09.259 --> 00:25:10.384
And her mother went in.

311
00:25:10.969 --> 00:25:12.469
That's how it works.

312
00:25:17.308 --> 00:25:20.269
Dustfinger saved us
from Capricorn that night.


313
00:25:20.812 --> 00:25:23.147
It was only then that I realized...

314
00:25:24.149 --> 00:25:26.608
...Resa, your mum...

315
00:25:26.776 --> 00:25:27.818
...she was gone.

316
00:25:29.487 --> 00:25:33.157
They'd come out of the book,
and she went into it.


317
00:25:37.662 --> 00:25:39.413
Resa!

318
00:25:40.248 --> 00:25:43.292
And that, Meggie, was the last time
that I read to you.


319
00:25:44.335 --> 00:25:45.794
The night we lost your mother.

320
00:25:51.509 --> 00:25:54.094
Oh, she went into the book.

321
00:25:58.183 --> 00:26:00.517
Oh. Goodness sake, Mortimer!

322
00:26:00.685 --> 00:26:03.479
All these years you've allowed me
to think the worst of Resa!


323
00:26:03.646 --> 00:26:06.815
- Why didn't you tell us?
- Would you have believed me?


324
00:26:07.567 --> 00:26:09.485
You want to read Mum
back out of the book.


325
00:26:11.196 --> 00:26:14.364
That's why you've been searching
for Inkheart all these years.


326
00:26:16.951 --> 00:26:18.952
If she's alive, you mean.

327
00:26:19.120 --> 00:26:21.538
You say she's trapped in that book.
How do you know?


328
00:26:21.706 --> 00:26:23.707
Who's to say she
got there? If she did...

329
00:26:23.875 --> 00:26:28.212
...how could she survive for nine years
if the monsters are anything like those?


330
00:26:28.379 --> 00:26:29.713
Or worse.

331
00:26:30.048 --> 00:26:33.383
How do you know where she is?
Or if she's alive, even.


332
00:26:33.968 --> 00:26:35.844
How do you know?

333
00:26:41.059 --> 00:26:43.602
- It's like the illustration in the book.
- Kind of scary.


334
00:26:43.770 --> 00:26:45.979
It's hideous. The man's got
no taste whatsoever.


335
00:26:46.147 --> 00:26:47.689
Look, will you stop pushing me!

336
00:26:53.363 --> 00:26:57.658
Meggie, just pretend that you're in a book.
Children always escape in books.


337
00:26:57.826 --> 00:26:59.117
No, they don't.

338
00:26:59.285 --> 00:27:01.036
Remember The Little Match Girl?

339
00:27:01.204 --> 00:27:03.831
They found her in an alley
frozen to death.


340
00:27:06.084 --> 00:27:07.584
Walk.

341
00:27:15.593 --> 00:27:17.261
Come in.

342
00:27:17.428 --> 00:27:20.013
We saved you the good seats.

343
00:27:20.181 --> 00:27:21.765
Capricorn.

344
00:27:22.433 --> 00:27:25.310
Uh! I told you to stop that!

345
00:27:25.478 --> 00:27:26.937
Please.

346
00:27:29.524 --> 00:27:31.191
You got old.

347
00:27:31.359 --> 00:27:32.442
You got a castle.

348
00:27:32.610 --> 00:27:34.611
- Indeed, I did.
- And a haircut.


349
00:27:34.779 --> 00:27:38.156
A lovely castle in a secluded part
of the country...


350
00:27:38.324 --> 00:27:40.492
...far from prying eyes.

351
00:27:41.870 --> 00:27:47.124
Oh, yes, I've adjusted rather well
to your world, don't you think?


352
00:27:49.127 --> 00:27:52.754
This must be your daughter.
So much life to live.


353
00:27:52.922 --> 00:27:57.301
You, however, are a noisy old bag. You
make a racket without opening your mouth.


354
00:27:57.468 --> 00:27:59.469
You barbaric piece of pulp fiction!

355
00:27:59.637 --> 00:28:02.139
Your malice is matched by your stupidity!

356
00:28:02.307 --> 00:28:05.267
I don't know how things are
in that third-rate novel of yours...


357
00:28:05.435 --> 00:28:08.770
...but where I come from one
does not go around ravaging libraries!


358
00:28:08.938 --> 00:28:15.152
My life's work, destroyed
by a bunch of unread, solecistic thugs!


359
00:28:15.320 --> 00:28:18.989
I have no patience
for old women with big mouths.


360
00:28:21.367 --> 00:28:22.409
You know my reader.

361
00:28:22.869 --> 00:28:26.747
Darius, why don't we show our guests
what I have been up against?


362
00:28:26.915 --> 00:28:28.415
Read that.

363
00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:30.542
But you said...

364
00:28:30.710 --> 00:28:34.504
...I wouldn't have to read
once he got here.


365
00:28:34.672 --> 00:28:36.965
Yes, well, I lied, didn't I,
when I said that?


366
00:28:38.676 --> 00:28:40.260
Read the book.

367
00:28:41.429 --> 00:28:46.767
"Rapunzel had splendid long hair.

368
00:28:46.935 --> 00:28:51.104
It was as fine as spun gold.

369
00:28:51.272 --> 00:28:53.315
And when she heard..."

370
00:29:00.615 --> 00:29:02.783
Help! No!

371
00:29:04.285 --> 00:29:05.786
Help!

372
00:29:09.040 --> 00:29:10.374
You see?

373
00:29:10.541 --> 00:29:14.002
Look at the writing on her face.
She's only been half read out of the book.


374
00:29:15.046 --> 00:29:16.546
- Take her to the dungeon.
No!


375
00:29:16.714 --> 00:29:19.383
- And give her a haircut.
No!


376
00:29:19.592 --> 00:29:22.678
I'm not going to read out loud,
if that's what you're intending.


377
00:29:23.471 --> 00:29:26.014
- Not with them in the room.
- Bring the girl up, please.


378
00:29:27.684 --> 00:29:29.226
You take your...

379
00:29:39.737 --> 00:29:42.906
Here's how this will work: You'll
do exactly what I tell you to do...


380
00:29:43.074 --> 00:29:47.327
...or I'll kill the old lady and lock
your daughter up for eternity. Is that clear?


381
00:29:50.915 --> 00:29:53.250
Great. Well, let's get things started,
shall we?


382
00:29:56.170 --> 00:30:00.090
This is a great book, filled with riches.

383
00:30:05.513 --> 00:30:06.555
Reading out treasure?

384
00:30:06.723 --> 00:30:10.434
For now. Someone has to pay for repairs,
and all the locals have been bled dry.


385
00:30:11.436 --> 00:30:15.439
I'm warning you. I have no control
over what comes and goes.


386
00:30:16.983 --> 00:30:18.775
I have no idea what's going to happen.

387
00:30:18.943 --> 00:30:21.945
Well, this should be fun, then.
Let's give it a whirl.


388
00:30:33.624 --> 00:30:36.877
<i>"Kasim gazed upon the treasures
within the cave.</i>


389
00:30:37.545 --> 00:30:42.841
<i>Mountains of gold and silver
were heaped from floor to ceiling.</i>


390
00:30:43.009 --> 00:30:46.720
<i>Piles of silks and sacks of jewels.</i>

391
00:30:47.972 --> 00:30:50.891
<i>Kasim gathered all the treasure
he could carry...</i>


392
00:30:51.059 --> 00:30:55.187
<i>...only to find
the door of the cave sealed shut.</i>


393
00:30:56.355 --> 00:30:58.023
<i>And by the will of Allah...</i>

394
00:30:58.649 --> 00:31:00.358
...he'd forgotten the password.

395
00:31:00.860 --> 00:31:03.236
<i>He cried out, '
Open Barley! '</i>

396
00:31:03.905 --> 00:31:07.657
<i>But the door did not budge. Kasim named
every grain of wheat he could think of.</i>


397
00:31:08.159 --> 00:31:10.994
<i>'Open Buckwheat! ' '
Open Millet! '</i>

398
00:31:11.162 --> 00:31:13.830
<i>But still the door would not open.</i>

399
00:31:14.373 --> 00:31:17.000
<i>Then came the sound
of approaching hooves."</i>


400
00:31:22.882 --> 00:31:23.924
<i>Sand.</i>

401
00:31:32.058 --> 00:31:36.937
<i>"Kasim ran to hide, but tripped,
sending coins spilling in every direction.</i>


402
00:31:37.105 --> 00:31:40.357
<i>Then came the muffled call of
'Open Sesame! '</i>


403
00:31:40.858 --> 00:31:42.776
<i>And the cave opened...</i>

404
00:31:43.861 --> 00:31:47.531
<i>...to reveal
a most unpleasant collection...</i>


405
00:31:48.741 --> 00:31:50.367
<i>...of bandits."</i>

406
00:31:51.244 --> 00:31:52.285
What?

407
00:32:33.077 --> 00:32:34.077
You see?

408
00:32:35.079 --> 00:32:36.746
Yes! Yes!

409
00:32:36.914 --> 00:32:38.248
That's how it's done!

410
00:32:41.836 --> 00:32:43.670
Look! What'd I tell you?

411
00:32:44.172 --> 00:32:48.425
Put that boy in the stable and feed him
to the ticking crocodile.


412
00:32:49.093 --> 00:32:51.094
But if he came out, who went in?

413
00:32:57.935 --> 00:32:58.760
Help.

414
00:33:00.400 --> 00:33:01.510
Help.

415
00:33:02.982 --> 00:33:04.430
It's my turn now.

416
00:33:06.940 --> 00:33:08.760
It's my turn now.

417
00:33:09.530 --> 00:33:10.614
Just like you promised.

418
00:33:11.282 --> 00:33:12.407
Your turn?

419
00:33:15.161 --> 00:33:17.787
Oh, you mean this.

420
00:33:20.625 --> 00:33:24.127
It's an incredibly rare book, this.
We've been tracking them down for years.


421
00:33:24.295 --> 00:33:26.379
I can't send you back. 
I don't know how.

422
00:33:27.048 --> 00:33:28.465
Send us back?

423
00:33:30.384 --> 00:33:33.136
Why would we ever want to go back...

424
00:33:33.304 --> 00:33:36.306
...when your world is so accommodating?

425
00:33:36.474 --> 00:33:39.643
With your telephones
and your guns and...


426
00:33:39.977 --> 00:33:41.478
What's that sticky stuff called?

427
00:33:41.729 --> 00:33:44.940
- Duct tape.
- Yes, duct tape.


428
00:33:45.107 --> 00:33:47.567
I love duct tape.

429
00:33:48.527 --> 00:33:51.363
Besides, what was I in Inkheart?

430
00:33:52.365 --> 00:33:53.990
The Adderhead's henchman.

431
00:33:54.492 --> 00:33:58.078
Living in the woods
with all those filthy beasts.


432
00:33:58.663 --> 00:33:59.996
But look at me now.

433
00:34:01.415 --> 00:34:02.499
I've got a castle.

434
00:34:03.584 --> 00:34:06.586
I'll never go back. 
None of us ever will.

435
00:34:07.213 --> 00:34:09.923
To make sure of that, I'm going to
do what I always do...


436
00:34:10.091 --> 00:34:12.509
...when someone digs up a copy
of this tedious book.


437
00:34:12.677 --> 00:34:14.219
You promised I'd be sent home.

438
00:34:14.387 --> 00:34:16.346
Yes, I know. I
lied when I said that.

439
00:34:16.514 --> 00:34:19.349
I mean, I'm a liar.
I lie all the time. Lie, lie, lie.


440
00:34:19.517 --> 00:34:22.352
After all these years,
you'd think he'd figure it out by now.


441
00:34:24.188 --> 00:34:25.605
- No!
- No!


442
00:34:26.524 --> 00:34:27.524
Get it! Get it out!

443
00:34:29.110 --> 00:34:30.777
No!

444
00:34:33.572 --> 00:34:36.950
Must you do that every single time?
It's pathetic, honestly.


445
00:34:38.577 --> 00:34:39.953
Don't!

446
00:34:43.708 --> 00:34:47.794
Now, get your burns tended to. Otherwise,
I'll be forced to cancel our Juggle Night.


447
00:34:47.962 --> 00:34:51.339
You know how much I look forward
to Juggle Night. Lock them up.


448
00:35:02.476 --> 00:35:07.063
Hey, Darius. Don't forget to feed
the crocodile, will you?


449
00:35:10.609 --> 00:35:12.235
Oh, for the love of Theseus!

450
00:35:16.741 --> 00:35:19.200
No, no, no. He didn't mean it.

451
00:35:19.368 --> 00:35:23.204
He's just hungry.
It's not his fault.


452
00:35:23.372 --> 00:35:24.539
He's a Minotaur.

453
00:35:24.707 --> 00:35:28.626
He can barely walk,
thanks to Darius and his reading.


454
00:35:28.794 --> 00:35:30.420
A lot is down to this jackass.

455
00:35:30.588 --> 00:35:34.382
We came out with half the book
tattooed across our face. Look at my eye.


456
00:35:34.759 --> 00:35:37.427
If you think that's bad,
look at the state of my nose.


457
00:35:37.595 --> 00:35:39.763
- It's disgusting.
- Ye... All right.


458
00:35:40.014 --> 00:35:43.350
So you can imagine how pleased we are
that you're here.


459
00:35:43.517 --> 00:35:47.854
Delighted. Because now we got someone
who can really read.


460
00:36:06.665 --> 00:36:08.583
I hurt myself.

461
00:36:09.377 --> 00:36:10.794
Again.

462
00:36:16.384 --> 00:36:18.051
I don't understand it.

463
00:36:19.553 --> 00:36:21.721
In Inkheart, my hands,
they never burned.


464
00:36:22.348 --> 00:36:23.390
But here!

465
00:36:26.227 --> 00:36:29.145
Fire has no sense of humor.

466
00:36:37.321 --> 00:36:38.822
You're trying to escape again?

467
00:36:39.198 --> 00:36:40.240
Resa...

468
00:36:41.075 --> 00:36:42.575
...give up.

469
00:36:43.494 --> 00:36:45.495
We're not going anywhere.

470
00:36:51.377 --> 00:36:53.169
For a moment...

471
00:36:55.005 --> 00:36:57.173
...I held Inkheart in my hands.

472
00:37:00.177 --> 00:37:02.053
But it's ashes now.

473
00:37:05.349 --> 00:37:07.559
And I shall never go home.

474
00:37:12.690 --> 00:37:13.773
But you...

475
00:37:14.358 --> 00:37:16.276
...you still have hope.

476
00:37:24.869 --> 00:37:28.955
When Darius read you out of Inkworld,
he left your voice behind in that book.


477
00:37:29.540 --> 00:37:30.832
But if you could talk...

478
00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:32.876
...would you tell me your story?

479
00:37:33.878 --> 00:37:35.378
Would you?

480
00:37:38.799 --> 00:37:40.175
No.

481
00:37:41.552 --> 00:37:45.472
No, you wouldn't. It's because of how
I'm written, isn't it?


482
00:37:45.639 --> 00:37:49.058
You think me weak and deceitful.

483
00:37:52.313 --> 00:37:53.855
It's not all I am.

484
00:37:57.902 --> 00:37:59.486
Not all of me.

485
00:38:13.042 --> 00:38:14.751
It's just a dream.

486
00:38:14.919 --> 00:38:17.045
It's just a dream. 
It's just a dream.

487
00:38:17.213 --> 00:38:18.713
Are you all right?

488
00:38:19.798 --> 00:38:22.467
- What's your name?
- My name is Farid.


489
00:38:22.635 --> 00:38:25.094
- Are you one of the 40 thieves?
- Stop talking to me.


490
00:38:25.262 --> 00:38:28.598
Don't you know it's bad luck
to speak in a dream? You stupid girl.


491
00:38:30.184 --> 00:38:33.770
You talk in a dream,
you never find your way back.


492
00:38:33.938 --> 00:38:35.355
"Stupid"?

493
00:38:35.773 --> 00:38:39.275
You're the one who thinks you're in
a dream. I was just trying to be nice.


494
00:38:39.443 --> 00:38:41.653
Go back to your muttering
and see if I care.


495
00:38:41.820 --> 00:38:44.614
It's just a dream. Just a dream.

496
00:38:49.828 --> 00:38:51.037
Come home.

497
00:38:52.122 --> 00:38:53.790
Please come home.

498
00:39:00.673 --> 00:39:02.298
Good morning.

499
00:39:04.009 --> 00:39:05.468
Thank you.

500
00:39:06.345 --> 00:39:08.263
How can I ever repay you?

501
00:39:11.141 --> 00:39:15.103
Resa, even if I could find you a key,
where would you go?


502
00:39:27.741 --> 00:39:29.158
This is your family?

503
00:39:34.832 --> 00:39:36.124
This is your husband?

504
00:39:38.335 --> 00:39:39.335
Your daughter?

505
00:39:54.143 --> 00:39:56.102
You went in the
book when I came out.

506
00:39:58.188 --> 00:39:59.606
You went in the book...

507
00:39:59.773 --> 00:40:01.649
...when I came out...

508
00:40:02.901 --> 00:40:05.194
...and then Darius read you out again.

509
00:40:05.362 --> 00:40:06.779
Gwin.

510
00:40:12.202 --> 00:40:15.872
I'm gonna get you out of these chains,
and then you're going home.


511
00:40:28.427 --> 00:40:30.470
I'll meet you at the stables.

512
00:41:16.892 --> 00:41:19.268
I've never been that in control before.

513
00:41:20.979 --> 00:41:23.106
I know I can get
Resa out of the book.

514
00:41:23.649 --> 00:41:25.942
And maybe send Capricorn back in.

515
00:41:26.276 --> 00:41:27.902
We just have to find another copy.

516
00:41:28.070 --> 00:41:30.905
Well, it only took you nine years
to find the last one.


517
00:41:32.449 --> 00:41:34.033
I bet the author has a copy.

518
00:41:36.453 --> 00:41:38.454
If he's alive, 
I bet he'd have one.

519
00:41:38.622 --> 00:41:40.832
Someone must know where he lives.

520
00:41:40.999 --> 00:41:44.627
Great. Now we're going to
have to try to escape, aren't we?


521
00:41:44.962 --> 00:41:47.797
Either that, or get fed
to the ticking crocodile next door.


522
00:41:48.674 --> 00:41:50.633
Someone has to stop him.

523
00:41:56.014 --> 00:41:58.516
Before you say anything,
I'm here to save your necks.


524
00:41:58.684 --> 00:42:02.103
After putting them on the chopping block
in the first place?


525
00:42:03.021 --> 00:42:07.525
Listen, you want your wife back
as much as I want to go home to my family.


526
00:42:07.693 --> 00:42:11.279
You think there's another copy
of Inkheart out there, let's find it together.


527
00:42:11.447 --> 00:42:13.865
And how do you intend that we escape?

528
00:42:16.785 --> 00:42:18.286
Page 14.

529
00:42:20.038 --> 00:42:21.789
The mighty storm?

530
00:42:23.333 --> 00:42:25.501
Get in the castle!
Let's go!


531
00:42:25.919 --> 00:42:29.005
<i>"From the far north they heard
a low wail of the wind...</i>


532
00:42:29.173 --> 00:42:31.174
<i>...and Uncle Henry and Dorothy
could see...</i>


533
00:42:31.341 --> 00:42:34.343
<i>...where the long grass bowed
in waves before the coming storm.</i>


534
00:42:35.596 --> 00:42:38.723
<i>'There's a cyclone coming, Em.
I'll go after the stock."'</i>


535
00:42:38.891 --> 00:42:41.267
Good doggies.

536
00:42:43.604 --> 00:42:45.146
<i>"Suddenly, Uncle Henry stood up."</i>

537
00:42:46.565 --> 00:42:48.357
Get out of the square!

538
00:42:48.692 --> 00:42:51.986
<i>"He ran toward the sheds where the cows
and the horses were kept.</i>


539
00:42:52.154 --> 00:42:54.238
<i>Aunt Em dropped her work
and came to the door.</i>


540
00:42:54.406 --> 00:42:56.824
<i>One glance told her
of the danger close at hand.</i>


541
00:42:56.992 --> 00:42:59.118
<i>'Quick, Dorothy! 
Run for the cellar!"'</i>

542
00:42:59.286 --> 00:43:00.703
There she is! Come on!

543
00:43:00.871 --> 00:43:02.288
<i>"A strange thing happened.</i>

544
00:43:02.998 --> 00:43:07.335
<i>The house whirled around two or three
times and rose slowly through the air.</i>


545
00:43:08.921 --> 00:43:12.381
<i>Dorothy felt as if
she were going up in a balloon."</i>


546
00:43:14.885 --> 00:43:16.010
That should do it!

547
00:43:19.681 --> 00:43:21.057
Let's get out of here!

548
00:43:25.729 --> 00:43:27.230
Must've run off!

549
00:43:33.487 --> 00:43:34.529
Help me!

550
00:43:52.589 --> 00:43:55.258
Come here! Let's go.

551
00:43:57.386 --> 00:43:59.554
Come on!
Straight on!


552
00:44:00.764 --> 00:44:02.765
- Come on!
Get them!


553
00:44:07.604 --> 00:44:09.272
Come on, get up!

554
00:44:24.204 --> 00:44:25.788
You were right.

555
00:44:26.248 --> 00:44:27.456
Mo!

556
00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:30.376
Gwin!
- Meggie!


557
00:44:31.837 --> 00:44:32.879
Meggie!

558
00:44:33.088 --> 00:44:35.631
Look! Hold on! Hold on! 
Wait, hold on!

559
00:44:37.092 --> 00:44:38.259
Don't move!

560
00:44:48.520 --> 00:44:49.979
Watch out!

561
00:44:55.485 --> 00:44:56.736
Dustfinger!

562
00:44:58.322 --> 00:44:59.822
Where are we going?

563
00:45:04.995 --> 00:45:07.330
Don't leave me!

564
00:45:10.167 --> 00:45:11.876
The prisoners!

565
00:45:12.336 --> 00:45:15.046
They're escaping!

566
00:45:21.094 --> 00:45:22.345
Run!

567
00:45:22.512 --> 00:45:23.971
Hurry, get in!
Run, run!


568
00:45:24.139 --> 00:45:25.848
Get in, get in!

569
00:45:30.562 --> 00:45:32.563
Get the keys, hurry up!
Take all the keys!


570
00:45:32.731 --> 00:45:34.732
Which one?
The one with the nine!


571
00:45:35.359 --> 00:45:37.443
Wait, wait, wait, Gwin!

572
00:45:38.695 --> 00:45:40.363
Come on, Gwin.

573
00:45:40.530 --> 00:45:42.281
Come on! Okay, go, go!

574
00:45:53.961 --> 00:45:55.378
Hold on!

575
00:46:01.843 --> 00:46:03.219
Watch out!

576
00:46:18.902 --> 00:46:20.403
Still think you're dreaming?

577
00:46:20.570 --> 00:46:22.071
Well, what else could it be?

578
00:46:22.739 --> 00:46:24.115
We're flying.

579
00:46:25.575 --> 00:46:28.744
Or is it the night flying past us?

580
00:46:32.749 --> 00:46:34.291
He lives in Alassio.

581
00:46:34.459 --> 00:46:35.793
Which way is that?

582
00:46:35.961 --> 00:46:40.214
South.
South? Can't you be more precise?


583
00:47:03.447 --> 00:47:04.613
Beats a camel, huh?

584
00:47:04.781 --> 00:47:05.865
Farid.

585
00:47:06.033 --> 00:47:07.616
Oh, hooligan.

586
00:47:07.784 --> 00:47:11.620
Farid, some clothes for you.
You'll freeze to death otherwise.


587
00:47:11.788 --> 00:47:13.122
Apparently this is the place.

588
00:47:13.290 --> 00:47:16.584
Man in the fishmonger's says he lives
in an apartment over the square.


589
00:47:16.752 --> 00:47:17.793
Good. Great.

590
00:47:18.587 --> 00:47:19.628
Oh, I'm not coming.

591
00:47:20.088 --> 00:47:23.132
What do you mean? You have to come,
otherwise he won't believe me.


592
00:47:23.300 --> 00:47:25.801
Oh, I don't know.
You can be pretty persuasive.


593
00:47:25.969 --> 00:47:27.762
Huh?
- You talked me out of a book.


594
00:47:28.138 --> 00:47:30.306
The book is right here within our grasp...

595
00:47:30.474 --> 00:47:31.974
You're afraid.

596
00:47:35.145 --> 00:47:36.979
You've never read Inkheart, have you?

597
00:47:37.481 --> 00:47:39.148
What's there to read?

598
00:47:39.816 --> 00:47:43.652
I've lived it. Except for the end,
and I've got no interest in that.


599
00:47:43.820 --> 00:47:44.820
Well, why not?

600
00:47:44.988 --> 00:47:47.406
Do you know the end
of your story, Meggie?


601
00:47:48.450 --> 00:47:50.659
No. And I suspect you wouldn't want to.

602
00:47:50.827 --> 00:47:54.789
It'd be like turning
to the last page of a mystery.


603
00:47:55.499 --> 00:47:59.126
- Where's the fun in that?
- Well, I think I know the end of my story.


604
00:48:00.128 --> 00:48:01.796
Hm?
- I'm going home.


605
00:48:02.130 --> 00:48:03.422
Why?

606
00:48:03.590 --> 00:48:05.841
I'm sorry. It's just
all too real for me.

607
00:48:06.009 --> 00:48:09.970
I prefer a story that has the good sense
to stay on the page where it belongs.


608
00:48:10.138 --> 00:48:13.015
No, I have to get back to my
poor, desecrated books.


609
00:48:13.183 --> 00:48:15.059
I want to mend
them, put them in order.

610
00:48:15.227 --> 00:48:18.229
- I'll do that. Let me...
- Here's some money for you.


611
00:48:18.396 --> 00:48:20.731
You see, I've already bought my ticket.

612
00:48:21.358 --> 00:48:22.733
Goodbye.

613
00:48:23.193 --> 00:48:24.652
Good luck.

614
00:48:33.036 --> 00:48:34.036
- Elinor...
- Let her go.


615
00:48:34.204 --> 00:48:35.329
Don't catch cold.

616
00:48:35.497 --> 00:48:37.039
Bye, then.

617
00:48:44.965 --> 00:48:46.882
Here it is. This must be it.

618
00:48:47.551 --> 00:48:48.968
That's it.

619
00:48:49.594 --> 00:48:51.512
What?

620
00:48:54.057 --> 00:48:56.225
- Signor Fenoglio?
- Yes?


621
00:48:57.060 --> 00:48:59.103
Sir, my name's Mortimer Folchart.

622
00:48:59.271 --> 00:49:00.437
- I'm Meggie.
- My daughter.


623
00:49:00.605 --> 00:49:02.731
- I want to be a writer too.
- You do?


624
00:49:02.899 --> 00:49:06.861
Yes. Give me something to write with.
Be quick, I've got a cake in the oven.


625
00:49:08.196 --> 00:49:09.947
You look like you've been taxidermied.

626
00:49:10.115 --> 00:49:12.992
- If you want an autograph, give me a pen.
- We don't want one.


627
00:49:13.160 --> 00:49:14.910
- You don't want an autograph?
- No.


628
00:49:15.078 --> 00:49:17.705
Then why in the name of Chaucer's beard
are you ringing?


629
00:49:17.873 --> 00:49:19.498
Well...

630
00:49:19.916 --> 00:49:23.252
Dustfinger's in the piazza, we just
escaped from Capricorn's village...


631
00:49:23.420 --> 00:49:25.838
...and you won't even believe
what Basta tried to do.


632
00:49:27.924 --> 00:49:29.258
What?

633
00:50:04.669 --> 00:50:05.711
Come home.

634
00:50:07.172 --> 00:50:09.340
Please, come home.

635
00:50:10.008 --> 00:50:11.550
A good story, I'll give you that.

636
00:50:11.718 --> 00:50:16.096
Silvertongues is a wonderful concept. Wish
I thought of it. Too absurd to take seriously.


637
00:50:16.264 --> 00:50:20.267
I know my characters are so believable
that they seem to leap off the page.


638
00:50:20.435 --> 00:50:22.561
But it's simply not possible.

639
00:50:31.821 --> 00:50:34.448
Exactly as I imagined him.

640
00:50:49.214 --> 00:50:51.840
This must be
what it feels like to give birth.


641
00:50:52.342 --> 00:50:54.510
Wait, where you going?
He doesn't want to meet.


642
00:50:54.678 --> 00:50:57.513
Of course he does.
I'm practically his father.


643
00:50:57.681 --> 00:50:59.640
Well, what was that at the end?

644
00:51:00.809 --> 00:51:02.101
It's called Dragon's Breath.

645
00:51:03.019 --> 00:51:04.812
You can teach to me?

646
00:51:07.899 --> 00:51:11.986
I'm sure that this must be very exciting
for you to meet your characters.


647
00:51:12.153 --> 00:51:15.281
But the purpose that we came here
was to find a way...


648
00:51:15.448 --> 00:51:17.032
...to get him back in the book.

649
00:51:17.200 --> 00:51:19.451
Your father's given me
an idea for a character.


650
00:51:19.619 --> 00:51:22.037
A master thief who steals things...

651
00:51:22.205 --> 00:51:25.708
...the way a blue jay swipes
shiny objects off window sills.


652
00:51:25.875 --> 00:51:27.543
I am not trying to steal them.

653
00:51:27.711 --> 00:51:31.880
You snatched them. You're trying to keep
them from me. That, my friend, is thievery.


654
00:51:32.048 --> 00:51:33.882
I'm just trying to get my wife back.

655
00:51:34.884 --> 00:51:35.884
- Dustfinger.
- I tried to stop him


656
00:51:36.052 --> 00:51:38.512
- So wonderful to meet you.
- Oh, no, no. No.


657
00:51:38.680 --> 00:51:41.390
The scars are perfect.
As hideous as I imagined.


658
00:51:41.558 --> 00:51:44.685
I told you, he's afraid.
But, oh, not me, I hope.


659
00:51:45.061 --> 00:51:47.396
He's afraid of what happens
at the end of the book.


660
00:51:47.564 --> 00:51:49.231
What do you mean? 
Because he dies?

661
00:51:50.400 --> 00:51:51.900
Oh, no.

662
00:51:53.278 --> 00:51:56.655
- Oh, I see. Right, I'm sorry.
- He dies in the end?


663
00:51:56.823 --> 00:52:00.617
I had to make the story exciting, it's my
job. They can't all have happy endings.


664
00:52:00.785 --> 00:52:02.911
Life doesn't always, after all.

665
00:52:05.623 --> 00:52:06.707
How's it happen?

666
00:52:06.875 --> 00:52:10.753
You're killed by one of Capricorn's men
while trying to save Gwin.


667
00:52:11.254 --> 00:52:14.423
It's a very touching death scene.
I cried when I wrote it.


668
00:52:14.924 --> 00:52:17.384
You think I care what you wrote?

669
00:52:18.928 --> 00:52:22.264
You don't control my fate.
Otherwise I wouldn't be here.


670
00:52:22.432 --> 00:52:25.184
I'm not just some character
in your book...


671
00:52:25.352 --> 00:52:27.853
...and you...

672
00:52:28.021 --> 00:52:29.897
...you're not my god.

673
00:52:31.107 --> 00:52:34.360
Now, listen, old man...

674
00:52:34.527 --> 00:52:36.737
...do you have a copy
of the book or don't you?


675
00:52:36.905 --> 00:52:39.948
Because I would like
to go home now, please.


676
00:52:42.369 --> 00:52:44.995
The problem is it's been
out of print for decades.


677
00:52:45.163 --> 00:52:48.123
Plus, the original print run
was quite small.


678
00:52:48.291 --> 00:52:50.334
Then there was the fire
in the warehouse...


679
00:52:50.502 --> 00:52:52.753
...and the publishers
went out of business.


680
00:52:52.921 --> 00:52:55.214
This is gonna take forever.

681
00:52:58.468 --> 00:53:01.970
Stop it. This is
no time to act foolishly.

682
00:53:05.392 --> 00:53:08.268
- Stop it.
- You're as sour as goat's urine.


683
00:53:09.104 --> 00:53:12.481
Thanks. And I don't want to know
how you know that.


684
00:53:13.149 --> 00:53:17.820
Look around. This garden is paradise.

685
00:53:17.987 --> 00:53:20.781
No slave drivers. 
No sandstorms.

686
00:53:21.282 --> 00:53:24.326
- No fleas.
- No peace and quiet.


687
00:53:26.830 --> 00:53:28.997
No, it's not that one either.

688
00:53:29.165 --> 00:53:30.707
I did hold on to a few copies...

689
00:53:30.875 --> 00:53:34.169
...but I loaned them to a book exhibition
in Genoa a few years ago...


690
00:53:34.337 --> 00:53:36.004
...and they were stolen.

691
00:53:36.172 --> 00:53:39.174
I suppose Capricorn
was behind the theft.


692
00:53:39.342 --> 00:53:42.511
At the time I assumed
it was just bad luck.


693
00:53:43.847 --> 00:53:46.014
- Ah! Here we are.
- What is it?


694
00:53:46.182 --> 00:53:49.935
The original manuscript. Look at that!
Typewritten, can you imagine?


695
00:53:50.103 --> 00:53:51.812
Grabbies.

696
00:53:52.814 --> 00:53:56.358
After all these years,
I still remember the characters.


697
00:53:57.777 --> 00:54:02.531
<i>The water nymphs in the Wayless Wood.</i>

698
00:54:07.662 --> 00:54:10.497
<i>And in the castles of Umbra...</i>

699
00:54:11.749 --> 00:54:13.041
<i>...the Black Prince.</i>

700
00:54:15.670 --> 00:54:16.712
<i>The Motley Folk.</i>

701
00:54:19.841 --> 00:54:22.050
<i>And of course you, 
Dustfinger.</i>

702
00:54:22.385 --> 00:54:23.677
<i>As well as the villains:</i>

703
00:54:24.596 --> 00:54:28.765
<i>The Adderhead,
Capricorn and the Fire Raisers.</i>


704
00:54:29.767 --> 00:54:33.187
And the worst of all, The Shadow.

705
00:54:42.197 --> 00:54:44.573
It's a wonderful book, I must say.

706
00:54:45.575 --> 00:54:47.576
I'd give anything to go into it myself.

707
00:54:47.744 --> 00:54:49.077
Well, get in line, old man.

708
00:54:49.245 --> 00:54:51.788
I've got page 209 to 447.
What do you got?


709
00:54:51.956 --> 00:54:52.998
I have the rest.

710
00:54:53.750 --> 00:54:54.958
All right. Need that.

711
00:54:55.251 --> 00:54:57.085
Now you can read me back, right?

712
00:54:57.253 --> 00:55:02.341
Well, I'll try to. But that's only after
I've read my wife out, and she's all right.


713
00:55:02.550 --> 00:55:04.426
It's the only way I'm gonna do it.

714
00:55:04.594 --> 00:55:07.346
- We might have a problem.
- What are you talking about?


715
00:55:07.972 --> 00:55:09.223
You can't read her out.

716
00:55:09.974 --> 00:55:11.016
Why?

717
00:55:11.976 --> 00:55:13.769
Because she's not in the book.

718
00:55:14.854 --> 00:55:16.939
What are you not telling me?
I've seen her.


719
00:55:17.106 --> 00:55:20.275
She's not actually in the book anymore.

720
00:55:20.443 --> 00:55:21.944
- She's...
Where?


721
00:55:22.111 --> 00:55:24.446
She's in Capricorn's village.
Darius read her out.


722
00:55:24.614 --> 00:55:27.324
- She's alive?
- We were just there and you didn't tell me!


723
00:55:27.492 --> 00:55:29.535
- We need the book.
- We didn't need the book!


724
00:55:29.702 --> 00:55:30.953
I needed the book!

725
00:55:31.120 --> 00:55:33.080
My mum was there
and you didn't tell us?


726
00:55:33.873 --> 00:55:35.958
Listen...
Yeah, don't look at me like that...


727
00:55:36.125 --> 00:55:39.378
...because if your Dad knew the truth,
he wouldn't have helped me...


728
00:55:39.546 --> 00:55:40.754
...and I need the book.

729
00:55:40.922 --> 00:55:45.050
- Selfish, repugnant, weak character!
- Blame him, he wrote me that way.


730
00:55:45.218 --> 00:55:47.636
- I disagree.
- You tell me how to find her!


731
00:55:47.804 --> 00:55:49.763
Not until you promise to read me back.

732
00:55:49.931 --> 00:55:54.059
- Tell me how to find my wife.
- I miss my family too.


733
00:56:01.985 --> 00:56:03.235
All right.

734
00:56:03.820 --> 00:56:04.987
Promise.

735
00:56:06.531 --> 00:56:07.573
I promise.

736
00:56:10.994 --> 00:56:13.120
I want to help save Mum too.

737
00:56:13.288 --> 00:56:15.455
- Take me with you.
- You know I can't do that.


738
00:56:15.623 --> 00:56:16.665
But I can help.

739
00:56:16.833 --> 00:56:21.587
You can help by staying here and
being safe. That's what you can do.


740
00:56:21.754 --> 00:56:23.505
You don't know what I can do.

741
00:56:27.760 --> 00:56:29.303
And neither do I.

742
00:56:29.846 --> 00:56:31.930
Meggie, will you please...?

743
00:56:37.729 --> 00:56:40.480
Okay, come on. 
You got to stay here.

744
00:56:49.741 --> 00:56:51.867
- Thanks very much. Take care of Meggie.
- Yes.


745
00:56:52.035 --> 00:56:54.828
- And Farid as well.
- What?


746
00:56:54.996 --> 00:56:57.539
- Take care of Farid as well.
- Of course.


747
00:56:57.707 --> 00:56:59.958
Why can't I come too? It's my car.

748
00:57:02.170 --> 00:57:04.004
Sweetheart.

749
00:57:07.383 --> 00:57:09.259
Just bring her back.

750
00:57:09.844 --> 00:57:11.345
I will.

751
00:57:17.727 --> 00:57:22.272
Reduced to babysitting. Marvelous.

752
00:57:34.744 --> 00:57:37.913
Hurry up, we'll miss the train.
How long will it take to get there?


753
00:57:38.081 --> 00:57:39.581
Not very long. Come on.

754
00:57:39.749 --> 00:57:41.750
Can I sit next to you, Mum?
Me too.


755
00:57:41.918 --> 00:57:43.585
I'll sit in the middle.

756
00:58:06.234 --> 00:58:11.113
<i>"That just happened,"
said Dorothy, simply. "I could not help it."</i>


757
00:58:15.326 --> 00:58:17.661
<i>You have no right to...</i>

758
00:58:22.917 --> 00:58:26.128
<i>"If you wish me to use my magic powers
to send you home...</i>


759
00:58:26.587 --> 00:58:28.630
<i>...you must do something for me first.</i>

760
00:58:29.465 --> 00:58:32.384
<i>Help me and I will help you."</i>

761
00:58:34.095 --> 00:58:36.263
<i>"What must I do?" said the girl.</i>

762
00:58:36.806 --> 00:58:39.683
<i>"Kill the Wicked Witch of the West."</i>

763
00:58:53.322 --> 00:58:56.074
<i>"From the far north they heard
a low wail of the wind...</i>


764
00:58:56.242 --> 00:58:59.494
...and Uncle Henry and Dorothy could see
where the long grass bowed...


765
00:58:59.662 --> 00:59:01.121
...before the coming storm."

766
00:59:11.466 --> 00:59:14.134
"It was Toto that made Dorothy laugh.

767
00:59:14.719 --> 00:59:17.220
He was a little black dog
with long silky hair...


768
00:59:17.388 --> 00:59:22.017
...and small black eyes that twinkled merrily
on either side of his funny wee nose."


769
00:59:24.771 --> 00:59:28.023
Toto? Oh, Toto, don't be scared.

770
00:59:28.191 --> 00:59:30.192
You're just not in Kansas anymore.

771
00:59:31.277 --> 00:59:33.069
Oh, Toto.

772
00:59:35.865 --> 00:59:38.158
Toto, come out from under there.

773
00:59:38.367 --> 00:59:39.576
You're gonna get me in trouble.

774
00:59:41.204 --> 00:59:43.288
It's me. Open the door.

775
00:59:43.456 --> 00:59:44.873
Just a minute.

776
00:59:46.042 --> 00:59:49.252
And not another sound. I mean it.

777
00:59:56.010 --> 00:59:58.845
I'm sorry, I had no choice.

778
00:59:59.013 --> 01:00:00.722
But, look, it's Basta.

779
01:00:01.224 --> 01:00:05.352
And I'm sorry, but I'm afraid all the
henchmen blend into one, even to me.


780
01:00:05.520 --> 01:00:10.232
- Hello, princess. Where's your father?
- Told him he'd gone, but they don't believe.


781
01:00:10.399 --> 01:00:12.943
- You told them?
- He held a knife to my throat.


782
01:00:13.110 --> 01:00:15.904
Isn't he awful?
And they don't believe I'm the author.


783
01:00:16.072 --> 01:00:19.407
Tell us where Silvertongue is
before I kill you both.


784
01:00:21.077 --> 01:00:22.244
Toto, no!

785
01:00:23.204 --> 01:00:24.746
Toto?

786
01:00:25.540 --> 01:00:28.166
Oh, my goodness!

787
01:00:28.334 --> 01:00:31.419
She's inherited her father's gift.

788
01:00:34.298 --> 01:00:36.132
Another Silvertongue.

789
01:00:36.342 --> 01:00:38.510
Old Capricorn will be pleased.

790
01:00:42.265 --> 01:00:43.598
Bring them both.

791
01:00:52.441 --> 01:00:55.277
So if Darius read
her out of the book...

792
01:00:55.444 --> 01:00:58.280
Oh, no, no, no. She's fine.

793
01:00:59.323 --> 01:01:01.074
- Mostly. She...
- Mostly?


794
01:01:02.827 --> 01:01:04.286
She's got no voice.

795
01:01:05.413 --> 01:01:08.456
- What?
- He read her out last spring...


796
01:01:09.792 --> 01:01:11.126
...and she has no voice.

797
01:01:12.628 --> 01:01:14.629
But apart from that, she's fine.

798
01:01:21.596 --> 01:01:24.222
- Pull over.
- For what?


799
01:01:24.807 --> 01:01:28.643
- Just pull over.
- That makes sense, you speaking weasel.


800
01:01:36.068 --> 01:01:38.153
I thought I told you to stay
with the old man.


801
01:01:38.321 --> 01:01:39.946
But he's mean.

802
01:01:40.615 --> 01:01:42.532
Not as mean as Capricorn.

803
01:01:43.534 --> 01:01:47.120
He doesn't scare me.
I was raised by murderers and thieves.


804
01:01:47.288 --> 01:01:48.914
Well, he should scare you.

805
01:01:51.167 --> 01:01:54.085
- I should make you walk back.
- I'd only follow you.


806
01:02:01.594 --> 01:02:02.677
Get in.

807
01:02:02.845 --> 01:02:04.763
After this, you teach me Dragon's Breath...

808
01:02:04.931 --> 01:02:07.015
Just get in the car.

809
01:02:15.066 --> 01:02:17.359
Hello, Mr. Fenoglio?

810
01:02:55.022 --> 01:02:57.065
These guys are just
circling the perimeter.


811
01:02:57.566 --> 01:02:59.317
We should move in now.

812
01:02:59.568 --> 01:03:01.194
When we get to maid's quarters...

813
01:03:01.362 --> 01:03:04.364
...Resa's room is the third door
on the right when we go in back.


814
01:03:04.532 --> 01:03:07.409
I'll go in the back. 
You guys cover me.

815
01:03:12.623 --> 01:03:14.916
All right, this is our way in.

816
01:03:15.084 --> 01:03:19.087
Now, listen, this is going to be dangerous
so you need to keep up.


817
01:03:19.255 --> 01:03:21.089
Got to move quickly.

818
01:03:29.807 --> 01:03:31.391
After you.

819
01:03:41.777 --> 01:03:43.028
Shall we rest?

820
01:03:45.114 --> 01:03:48.450
No, that's okay. 
Just keep moving.

821
01:03:49.660 --> 01:03:52.454
- Kids.
- No, I'm fine.


822
01:03:56.125 --> 01:03:58.209
What was that?
Where?


823
01:03:58.961 --> 01:04:00.253
There!

824
01:04:00.421 --> 01:04:01.713
- Over there!
Shoot him!


825
01:04:01.881 --> 01:04:04.299
- Bring him down!
Thanks.


826
01:04:06.427 --> 01:04:09.429
They're there behind the square.
Oh, no.


827
01:04:09.597 --> 01:04:11.139
Well, come on. Quick.

828
01:04:15.269 --> 01:04:18.188
Hurry! Go on!
Head him off at the square!


829
01:04:21.025 --> 01:04:23.234
Don't let him get away!

830
01:05:28.551 --> 01:05:31.219
Look. Look at this.
Look at the Dragon's Breath.


831
01:05:31.387 --> 01:05:33.513
I think I got it. 
Here, feel my hand.

832
01:05:36.517 --> 01:05:39.060
It's been too long.
I'm going to see if he's all right.


833
01:05:39.228 --> 01:05:41.396
Come on.
We'll find him.


834
01:05:43.524 --> 01:05:45.191
He's not far away.

835
01:05:47.903 --> 01:05:50.405
- Well done. Thank you.
- My pleasure.


836
01:05:57.913 --> 01:06:00.665
Look who's back. This is nice.

837
01:06:03.377 --> 01:06:05.503
Just in time for your execution.

838
01:06:11.468 --> 01:06:13.052
All right.

839
01:06:15.890 --> 01:06:18.933
Capricorn's castle is like a five-star hotel.

840
01:06:19.101 --> 01:06:21.769
Not for you, obviously.
You'll be locked in the crypt.


841
01:06:21.937 --> 01:06:25.481
But some of our guests
get a room with a view.


842
01:06:30.112 --> 01:06:31.404
Resa.

843
01:06:31.655 --> 01:06:32.864
Sorry.

844
01:06:33.032 --> 01:06:35.617
Listen, your husband's here.

845
01:06:37.244 --> 01:06:38.369
He's come to rescue you.

846
01:07:00.100 --> 01:07:01.768
That way! That way!

847
01:07:13.280 --> 01:07:14.906
There!

848
01:07:15.074 --> 01:07:16.199
Come on!

849
01:07:16.367 --> 01:07:17.492
What happened?

850
01:07:17.660 --> 01:07:19.661
They're going to kill Dustfinger.

851
01:07:21.038 --> 01:07:23.498
Here.
- They're going to kill him and it's my fault.


852
01:07:23.666 --> 01:07:24.999
No, it's not. What happened?

853
01:07:29.171 --> 01:07:30.922
All the letters of the alphabet.

854
01:07:31.090 --> 01:07:32.924
It looks just like my book.

855
01:07:33.092 --> 01:07:35.510
It's like walking into
my own imagination.


856
01:07:35.678 --> 01:07:38.054
I wonder what Capricorn's
going to make you read.


857
01:07:38.222 --> 01:07:39.847
I hope it's something good.

858
01:07:40.015 --> 01:07:42.600
I'm excited, I am. Are you, eh?

859
01:07:45.229 --> 01:07:47.689
<i>"'What raft, Jim? ' '
Our old raft.'</i>

860
01:07:47.856 --> 01:07:50.817
<i>'You mean to say our old raft
wasn't smashed all to flinders?"'</i>


861
01:08:07.167 --> 01:08:08.293
I'm convinced.

862
01:08:10.713 --> 01:08:13.673
Though I don't know what that poor boy
will do without his raft.


863
01:08:16.176 --> 01:08:18.553
- No.
- I'm tired of doing stupid tricks for you.


864
01:08:18.721 --> 01:08:20.054
Tell me where my father is.

865
01:08:20.222 --> 01:08:23.057
I have absolutely no idea.

866
01:08:23.225 --> 01:08:27.145
Quite frankly, I don't care, because
you read just as well as he does.


867
01:08:33.944 --> 01:08:35.653
What are you gawking at?

868
01:08:35.821 --> 01:08:38.072
You're just as I wrote you.

869
01:08:38.574 --> 01:08:39.907
A cowardly thug.

870
01:08:40.451 --> 01:08:42.577
How dare you.

871
01:08:43.579 --> 01:08:45.830
You'll pay for your filthy story!

872
01:08:50.544 --> 01:08:52.920
Only the king can pull it out.

873
01:08:53.088 --> 01:08:55.757
Don't you remember?

874
01:08:57.509 --> 01:09:00.345
Don't you ever laugh at me.

875
01:09:02.765 --> 01:09:05.933
Get it away from me. I want it
executed with the others.


876
01:09:06.101 --> 01:09:09.604
The dog? You want the dog executed?

877
01:09:10.272 --> 01:09:15.109
As for you, we'll see how you enamored
of your creations you are...


878
01:09:15.277 --> 01:09:18.112
...when The Shadow
is flaying the skin off your back.


879
01:09:18.280 --> 01:09:22.450
You can't bring it out of the book.
You burnt the last copy. I saw you do it.


880
01:09:25.287 --> 01:09:26.788
Wrong.

881
01:09:28.123 --> 01:09:30.291
I saved a copy
of the book for myself.

882
01:09:30.459 --> 01:09:32.210
Aren't I full of surprises?

883
01:09:38.926 --> 01:09:43.304
No, I couldn't burn them all, could I?

884
01:09:43.972 --> 01:09:46.641
Not with my old friend trapped inside.

885
01:09:46.809 --> 01:09:48.476
Oh, you are going to love him.

886
01:09:48.644 --> 01:09:53.773
And by love,
I mean cower in terror from.


887
01:09:53.941 --> 01:09:56.484
You see, I love this world...

888
01:09:56.652 --> 01:09:59.904
...and I intend to write my name
on every page of it.


889
01:10:00.072 --> 01:10:01.614
You...

890
01:10:01.782 --> 01:10:04.325
...and The Shadow are going to help me
do just that.


891
01:10:07.996 --> 01:10:09.831
I won't read anything for you.

892
01:10:10.666 --> 01:10:12.166
Oh, really?

893
01:10:14.128 --> 01:10:19.132
Let me show you what happens
to those who disobey me around here.


894
01:10:20.175 --> 01:10:22.427
She's been very naughty, this one.

895
01:10:23.178 --> 01:10:25.346
Tiresome in the extreme.

896
01:10:25.514 --> 01:10:26.848
Always trying to escape.

897
01:10:27.516 --> 01:10:29.100
So I'm putting an end to it.

898
01:10:30.644 --> 01:10:33.229
- Meggie.
- Mum.


899
01:10:35.983 --> 01:10:37.358
It's you.

900
01:10:37.526 --> 01:10:42.155
Mo's here. We're going to get out.
We're going to escape. We'll all escape.


901
01:10:42.865 --> 01:10:44.073
Well...

902
01:10:47.369 --> 01:10:51.164
...what a touching display of empathy.

903
01:10:51.540 --> 01:10:53.082
"Mum."

904
01:10:54.710 --> 01:10:56.335
Look at me.

905
01:11:01.508 --> 01:11:03.384
Yes, I can see the resemblance.

906
01:11:05.721 --> 01:11:10.016
Do you still think I can't convince you
to read for me?


907
01:11:16.023 --> 01:11:18.065
No! Mum! Mum!

908
01:11:18.233 --> 01:11:20.902
Please! Please!

909
01:11:25.240 --> 01:11:26.949
Meggie!

910
01:11:30.078 --> 01:11:32.163
Is it too late to make any changes?

911
01:11:32.331 --> 01:11:33.331
Changes?

912
01:11:33.499 --> 01:11:37.210
Just thinking perhaps you might be able
to add a few lines, you know what I mean?


913
01:11:37.377 --> 01:11:40.087
I don't need to be some great beauty,
or anything.


914
01:11:40.255 --> 01:11:42.089
I don't know if you noticed my nose.

915
01:11:42.257 --> 01:11:44.050
Oh, your nose. Yes, right.

916
01:11:44.218 --> 01:11:47.094
Think you could do that?
Rewrite things, change things a bit.


917
01:11:47.554 --> 01:11:50.598
I don't know. It's a wonderful idea.

918
01:11:53.727 --> 01:11:55.144
Move.

919
01:12:00.734 --> 01:12:03.444
- What are you doing? Get off me.
- You can't go down there.


920
01:12:03.612 --> 01:12:06.280
- They have my daughter.
- They kill her if you do anything.


921
01:12:06.448 --> 01:12:09.992
- I should never have left her alone.
- We have to stay hidden.


922
01:12:20.128 --> 01:12:22.964
Nothing to be frightened of.
It's just dusty old coffins.


923
01:12:23.131 --> 01:12:27.176
If there are any nasty spirits down here,
it's not us they're angry at.


924
01:12:27.344 --> 01:12:32.181
Princess needs to rest
that voice of hers for tonight.


925
01:12:46.363 --> 01:12:49.824
I've seen my mum. 
She's a prisoner here.

926
01:12:50.784 --> 01:12:51.826
I know.

927
01:12:53.662 --> 01:12:55.496
Have you seen my dad?

928
01:12:55.664 --> 01:12:56.831
Yeah, he's fine.

929
01:12:58.458 --> 01:13:00.626
Capricorn's got another copy
of the book.


930
01:13:02.671 --> 01:13:05.381
He's gonna make me
read The Shadow out of it.


931
01:13:07.467 --> 01:13:09.510
I have Mo's gift.

932
01:13:10.220 --> 01:13:11.512
I can do it.

933
01:13:12.639 --> 01:13:14.890
Well, then you could read me back.

934
01:13:15.350 --> 01:13:17.351
"One moonlit night...

935
01:13:17.519 --> 01:13:21.314
...The Shadow
turned on his despicable..."


936
01:13:25.527 --> 01:13:27.069
Make him kill Capricorn.

937
01:13:27.237 --> 01:13:29.196
Make The Shadow do it.

938
01:13:30.198 --> 01:13:32.533
Food for the little princess.

939
01:13:35.871 --> 01:13:38.706
Capricorn wants you to have
your strength for tonight.


940
01:13:38.874 --> 01:13:41.042
You should stay.
We're telling ghost stories.


941
01:13:41.918 --> 01:13:44.045
Right. You don't like
ghost stories, do you?


942
01:13:44.212 --> 01:13:46.213
I'll give you ghost stories, you...!

943
01:13:50.719 --> 01:13:52.053
Get it off of me!

944
01:13:58.268 --> 01:13:59.560
My pouch!

945
01:14:00.937 --> 01:14:02.813
You don't have your good luck charm.

946
01:14:02.981 --> 01:14:04.106
Give me that back!

947
01:14:04.274 --> 01:14:06.150
Why don't you come in and get it?

948
01:14:08.528 --> 01:14:09.570
What are you doing?

949
01:14:09.738 --> 01:14:13.074
Someone's got to get us out,
and I don't think it'll be the writer.


950
01:14:15.202 --> 01:14:16.577
You give that back to me.

951
01:14:16.745 --> 01:14:17.995
You be careful.

952
01:14:19.373 --> 01:14:21.499
Maybe I don't need my good luck.

953
01:14:21.917 --> 01:14:23.668
Time to finish what we started.

954
01:14:30.133 --> 01:14:33.427
By the bones of the dead man
in this coffin, I curse you.


955
01:14:33.595 --> 01:14:35.930
Don't you say that. 
Take that back!

956
01:14:36.098 --> 01:14:39.266
May his spirit haunt your every step.

957
01:14:39.434 --> 01:14:40.434
You take that back!

958
01:14:50.445 --> 01:14:52.947
Open this gate.
Hurry up. Quickly.


959
01:14:53.115 --> 01:14:54.407
- Open the gate.
Come on.


960
01:14:54.574 --> 01:14:55.991
Let me out.

961
01:14:57.536 --> 01:15:00.454
- Which one?
- Help! The prisoners are escaping!


962
01:15:01.123 --> 01:15:02.373
The fire! Use your fire!

963
01:15:02.541 --> 01:15:04.458
Come on, hurry up.

964
01:15:06.294 --> 01:15:08.754
Help! The prisoners are escaping!

965
01:15:09.589 --> 01:15:11.424
The prisoners are escaping!

966
01:15:11.591 --> 01:15:12.633
Come on!

967
01:15:13.135 --> 01:15:14.510
Come on.

968
01:15:14.678 --> 01:15:17.054
The prisoners are escaping! Help!

969
01:15:17.681 --> 01:15:18.931
Help! Quick!

970
01:15:19.099 --> 01:15:20.141
I'm sorry, I can't.

971
01:15:21.143 --> 01:15:23.102
- I can't, I'm sorry.
- Stay!


972
01:15:23.270 --> 01:15:24.311
Don't go.

973
01:15:24.479 --> 01:15:27.481
You don't have to be selfish
just because that's how I wrote you!


974
01:15:27.649 --> 01:15:29.984
You're more than that!
You said so yourself!


975
01:15:30.152 --> 01:15:31.444
Stay and help us!

976
01:15:38.160 --> 01:15:39.660
Help!

977
01:15:41.163 --> 01:15:43.873
The prisoners are escaping! Help!

978
01:15:53.341 --> 01:15:55.176
Check all the courtyards!

979
01:15:55.343 --> 01:15:56.510
Let me out!

980
01:16:20.202 --> 01:16:22.203
Don't leave! Come back!

981
01:16:24.372 --> 01:16:25.539
Oh, God.

982
01:16:30.879 --> 01:16:34.715
This is quite possibly the most stupid thing
you've ever done in your life, Elinor.


983
01:16:34.883 --> 01:16:37.218
There are a bunch of
murderous thugs up there.


984
01:16:37.385 --> 01:16:40.346
You think you're going to just walk in
and tell them what to do?


985
01:16:40.514 --> 01:16:42.473
Very likely to listen to you, aren't they?

986
01:16:42.641 --> 01:16:45.518
Silly old bookworm
with your head in the clouds.


987
01:16:58.740 --> 01:17:00.741
- Thank you.
- You're alive.


988
01:17:00.909 --> 01:17:02.409
Thank you.

989
01:17:02.744 --> 01:17:05.246
All right. All right.
All right, that's enough.


990
01:17:05.413 --> 01:17:07.581
Did you find them?
Resa, Meggie, how are they?


991
01:17:07.749 --> 01:17:09.083
- They're fine.
- Good.


992
01:17:09.251 --> 01:17:10.584
For now.

993
01:17:11.086 --> 01:17:14.171
- But Capricorn has a copy of the book.
- He what?


994
01:17:15.090 --> 01:17:16.757
He kept one secretly.

995
01:17:17.634 --> 01:17:22.429
That was always his plan,
to have The Shadow read out of the book.


996
01:17:23.431 --> 01:17:27.268
I can't read The Shadow out.
That would kill us all.


997
01:17:27.435 --> 01:17:29.103
He doesn't need you anymore.

998
01:17:31.106 --> 01:17:32.731
He found someone else.

999
01:17:33.275 --> 01:17:34.608
Meggie.

1000
01:17:34.776 --> 01:17:36.193
Meggie?

1001
01:17:49.165 --> 01:17:50.374
Having writer's block?

1002
01:17:51.626 --> 01:17:52.960
Maybe I can help.

1003
01:17:53.128 --> 01:17:55.713
Yeah, that's right.
You want to be a writer, don't you?


1004
01:17:55.881 --> 01:18:00.676
- You say that as if it's a bad thing.
- No, no. Just a lonely thing.


1005
01:18:00.844 --> 01:18:02.469
The world you create on the page...

1006
01:18:02.637 --> 01:18:05.431
...seems more friendly and alive
than the world you live in.


1007
01:18:05.932 --> 01:18:07.892
And you wish you could be there instead.

1008
01:18:10.020 --> 01:18:11.770
You're a clever girl, Meggie.

1009
01:18:11.938 --> 01:18:15.482
I couldn't have hoped for a finer young
lady to be shut up in a crypt with...


1010
01:18:15.650 --> 01:18:18.068
...whilst awaiting my execution.

1011
01:18:19.154 --> 01:18:22.656
Now, I haven't really got
what I need yet...


1012
01:18:22.824 --> 01:18:24.241
...but it's very close.

1013
01:18:29.164 --> 01:18:31.624
Come on, feed us.

1014
01:18:31.791 --> 01:18:35.336
Blast, they're early. Why are they early?
This is most inconvenient.


1015
01:18:35.503 --> 01:18:39.173
Put one here somewhere. The words
have to be perfect or it won't work.


1016
01:18:39.341 --> 01:18:43.469
<i>They have to be written by the writer.
It has to sound like Inkheart.</i>


1017
01:18:43.845 --> 01:18:45.930
Ah. Here it is.

1018
01:18:48.683 --> 01:18:49.975
Here what is?

1019
01:18:50.143 --> 01:18:52.353
Something for her to
remember me by after I'm gone.


1020
01:18:54.522 --> 01:18:58.776
I don't think much
of your crude scribblings, old man.


1021
01:19:00.070 --> 01:19:02.696
Well, you are my crude scribblings,
Magpie...


1022
01:19:02.864 --> 01:19:05.491
...so I'd be careful
what I scrumple up if I were you.


1023
01:19:05.659 --> 01:19:09.203
- Where are you taking her?
- To put on her party frock.


1024
01:19:09.371 --> 01:19:12.706
Oh, don't worry, you're invited
to the feast as well.


1025
01:19:12.874 --> 01:19:16.043
We wouldn't eat without you.
In fact, you're the main course.


1026
01:19:16.378 --> 01:19:20.172
The Shadow will be feeding on you
and that maid later tonight...


1027
01:19:20.340 --> 01:19:24.259
...so rest assured
somebody will be back to fetch you.


1028
01:19:30.058 --> 01:19:32.768
You wanted to be alone,
didn't you? Well, here you are.


1029
01:19:32.936 --> 01:19:34.478
Alone in the wilderness.

1030
01:19:34.646 --> 01:19:37.189
Mosquito bites and blisters and...

1031
01:19:38.024 --> 01:19:40.234
Oh, God.

1032
01:19:41.403 --> 01:19:43.946
And do you have
a plan? No, no plan.

1033
01:19:44.114 --> 01:19:47.241
Just rent a motorbike, find a map.

1034
01:19:47.409 --> 01:19:49.410
We'll figure it out when we get there.

1035
01:19:52.372 --> 01:19:53.580
- This is the plan.
- Good.


1036
01:19:53.748 --> 01:19:57.418
- You use your fire and create a distraction.
- I can set fire to the castle.


1037
01:19:57.585 --> 01:19:58.877
I can help too.

1038
01:19:59.045 --> 01:20:00.754
Don't get in my way.

1039
01:20:01.965 --> 01:20:04.425
When Capricorn's men
try to put the fire out...


1040
01:20:04.926 --> 01:20:08.679
...I move in, I rescue Meggie and Resa.
- But we're outnumbered.


1041
01:20:09.139 --> 01:20:11.265
- And they have these...
- Guns.


1042
01:20:11.433 --> 01:20:14.560
That's why we disguise ourselves
as Black Jackets. Let's go.


1043
01:20:16.896 --> 01:20:18.605
Well, come on, then.

1044
01:20:23.278 --> 01:20:27.781
This really is a beautiful little village.

1045
01:20:29.075 --> 01:20:31.952
But it'll be nice to have something
a bit bigger.


1046
01:20:32.787 --> 01:20:34.580
Stretch out.

1047
01:20:35.749 --> 01:20:38.125
Expand my kingdom's borders.

1048
01:20:39.169 --> 01:20:41.170
That's why I need The Shadow.

1049
01:20:41.337 --> 01:20:44.089
And I don't want anyone else escaping.

1050
01:20:56.978 --> 01:21:01.231
If you don't stop shaking,
I'm going to stick you with a pin.


1051
01:21:05.987 --> 01:21:09.364
Do you honestly expect me to read
an entire army out of this book?


1052
01:21:09.532 --> 01:21:11.825
- Do you have a better idea?
- No.


1053
01:21:11.993 --> 01:21:13.160
Thought not.

1054
01:21:22.504 --> 01:21:24.379
Get a move on.

1055
01:21:25.423 --> 01:21:26.840
Go on.

1056
01:21:29.219 --> 01:21:30.677
Yes.

1057
01:21:31.221 --> 01:21:32.721
Come on! Come on!

1058
01:21:43.149 --> 01:21:44.191
Go on.

1059
01:21:53.201 --> 01:21:54.660
Forward.

1060
01:21:57.622 --> 01:22:01.500
Don't try anything funny
or you'll never see your mother alive again.


1061
01:22:05.004 --> 01:22:06.630
Please.

1062
01:22:08.716 --> 01:22:14.346
The time has come to be reunited
with our old friend!


1063
01:22:39.581 --> 01:22:40.747
Well, tie them up, then.

1064
01:22:45.128 --> 01:22:46.670
Good evening.

1065
01:22:47.755 --> 01:22:49.756
Do you want to get out of here?

1066
01:22:51.467 --> 01:22:53.760
Then you're going to have to help me.

1067
01:23:01.269 --> 01:23:03.896
<i>Inkheart! Inkheart! Inkheart!</i>

1068
01:23:04.063 --> 01:23:05.522
Read it!

1069
01:23:06.566 --> 01:23:08.192
Read the words!

1070
01:23:10.737 --> 01:23:12.237
<i>Inkheart!</i>

1071
01:23:14.908 --> 01:23:17.201
Say the words!

1072
01:23:25.335 --> 01:23:27.294
You're very good at that.

1073
01:23:30.798 --> 01:23:33.383
Doesn't mean we're friends or anything.

1074
01:23:35.970 --> 01:23:38.597
Read it!
Read it!


1075
01:23:38.765 --> 01:23:40.307
<i>Inkheart!</i>

1076
01:23:44.062 --> 01:23:45.103
Read it!

1077
01:23:47.315 --> 01:23:48.899
I got it. Here.

1078
01:23:50.902 --> 01:23:53.612
"Capricorn led an army of brutal men...

1079
01:23:53.780 --> 01:23:58.617
...who struck fear in the hearts and minds
of all those they came in contact with.


1080
01:24:00.453 --> 01:24:02.162
- Whenever they passed by...
- Resa.


1081
01:24:02.330 --> 01:24:05.832
...people closed their doors
and hid with their children.


1082
01:24:19.097 --> 01:24:21.598
But of all the villains
lurking in the Wayless Wood...


1083
01:24:21.766 --> 01:24:26.645
...the one most feared and reviled
was known simply as The Shadow."


1084
01:24:27.772 --> 01:24:29.439
The Shadow.

1085
01:24:31.317 --> 01:24:33.860
"Made from the ashes
of Capricorn's victims...


1086
01:24:34.028 --> 01:24:36.530
...The Shadow
was immortal and invulnerable...


1087
01:24:37.532 --> 01:24:39.992
...and as pitiless as his master.

1088
01:24:42.870 --> 01:24:45.038
His fingers and even his breath
brought death...


1089
01:24:45.206 --> 01:24:48.542
...scenting his way
like a hound on the trail."


1090
01:24:59.762 --> 01:25:02.222
"He appears only
when Capricorn calls him...


1091
01:25:02.390 --> 01:25:05.058
...rising from the ground,
a faceless and fiery beast.


1092
01:25:05.226 --> 01:25:08.312
- No. Stop reading. Stop.
- Always eager to consume his next victim."


1093
01:25:12.734 --> 01:25:14.026
Stop reading, Meggie.

1094
01:25:15.820 --> 01:25:17.070
Meggie, stop reading!

1095
01:25:58.446 --> 01:25:59.529
Beautiful.

1096
01:26:03.451 --> 01:26:04.743
Feast.

1097
01:26:07.914 --> 01:26:09.498
Mum!

1098
01:26:12.543 --> 01:26:13.627
Shadow!

1099
01:26:14.462 --> 01:26:17.214
- Shadow!
Toto! Good boy.


1100
01:26:24.305 --> 01:26:25.764
Mum!

1101
01:26:26.682 --> 01:26:27.724
Feast.

1102
01:26:34.065 --> 01:26:37.818
"Yet one starlit night,
The Shadow heard a different voice.


1103
01:26:37.985 --> 01:26:41.154
The voice of a girl, and when
she called his name, he remembered."


1104
01:26:41.322 --> 01:26:42.364
Take that book!

1105
01:26:42.532 --> 01:26:45.242
"He remembered all those
from whose ashes he was made.


1106
01:26:45.410 --> 01:26:47.786
All the pain and all the grief.

1107
01:26:48.746 --> 01:26:51.581
The Shadow remembered,
and he was determined to take revenge.


1108
01:26:51.749 --> 01:26:55.627
Revenge on those whose cruelty
was the cause of all this misfortune."


1109
01:26:55.795 --> 01:26:58.171
- Make her stop.
- "Shadow went to his master...


1110
01:26:58.339 --> 01:27:01.341
...and reached out to him
with ashen hands."


1111
01:27:03.010 --> 01:27:05.846
That's not right!
Take it away!


1112
01:27:09.517 --> 01:27:13.019
That's not the book.
Those aren't the real words.


1113
01:27:13.187 --> 01:27:16.022
Stop her. Somebody stop her reading!

1114
01:27:17.024 --> 01:27:18.859
- Stop her!
Meggie, watch out!


1115
01:27:19.819 --> 01:27:20.950
Mo!

1116
01:27:23.132 --> 01:27:24.132
Mo!

1117
01:27:25.992 --> 01:27:28.368
- Give that here!
Give it back!


1118
01:27:35.501 --> 01:27:37.502
What a pleasant turn of events.

1119
01:27:40.882 --> 01:27:45.552
Silvertongue,
you're just in time for dinner!


1120
01:27:54.103 --> 01:27:55.562
No!

1121
01:27:56.397 --> 01:27:58.231
Not my castle!

1122
01:27:58.733 --> 01:28:02.950
Attack!

1123
01:28:06.302 --> 01:28:09.210
A-t-tack!

1124
01:28:16.584 --> 01:28:18.168
- Get off!
Get out of my way!


1125
01:28:23.633 --> 01:28:25.217
Resa.

1126
01:28:26.761 --> 01:28:28.762
No! Get off!

1127
01:28:28.930 --> 01:28:30.263
What...! No!

1128
01:28:36.771 --> 01:28:39.940
You think these misfits can conquer me?

1129
01:28:40.191 --> 01:28:42.567
Go! Devour her!

1130
01:28:43.903 --> 01:28:47.197
- You'll have to get past me first!
- Watch out, Mo!


1131
01:28:49.575 --> 01:28:50.617
Just keep reading!

1132
01:28:50.785 --> 01:28:52.202
What?
Keep reading!


1133
01:28:52.370 --> 01:28:54.496
I can't! There's nothing left to read.

1134
01:28:55.915 --> 01:28:56.957
Then write.

1135
01:29:05.132 --> 01:29:06.925
Come on, Meggie!

1136
01:29:07.760 --> 01:29:09.052
You can do it!

1137
01:29:09.220 --> 01:29:11.763
The Shadow turned away
from the innocent.


1138
01:29:11.931 --> 01:29:13.473
Come on, Meggie.

1139
01:29:18.437 --> 01:29:20.772
"The Shadow turned away
from the innocent.


1140
01:29:23.317 --> 01:29:27.404
And back to the evil master
who had controlled him all these years.


1141
01:29:30.658 --> 01:29:34.995
The Shadow reached out to him
with ashen hands.


1142
01:29:35.830 --> 01:29:40.834
And as it did, Capricorn began to crackle
and fade like the old page of a book...


1143
01:29:42.086 --> 01:29:45.088
...growing transparent
and thin as paper."


1144
01:29:47.508 --> 01:29:49.342
I won't let you!

1145
01:29:52.013 --> 01:29:53.513
Dad!

1146
01:29:57.310 --> 01:30:00.270
"Capricorn's ink-black soul
filled with terror...


1147
01:30:01.147 --> 01:30:02.522
...as he saw the end was near.

1148
01:30:03.524 --> 01:30:07.110
And so, too, did the souls of all those
within The Shadow's gaze...


1149
01:30:07.278 --> 01:30:09.487
...who'd committed villainy
in Capricorn's name.


1150
01:30:09.655 --> 01:30:13.116
And then they blew away,
like ashes in the wind."


1151
01:30:15.870 --> 01:30:17.370
Stop! Help!

1152
01:30:25.129 --> 01:30:26.546
No!

1153
01:30:35.890 --> 01:30:40.810
"While the terrible monster himself
disintegrated and was no more."


1154
01:31:01.290 --> 01:31:03.458
It's Meggie. She's reading.

1155
01:31:03.626 --> 01:31:06.878
They're going back into their books.
I'm going to miss it!


1156
01:31:07.046 --> 01:31:09.589
I don't want to go back
into my stinking book.


1157
01:31:09.840 --> 01:31:14.094
"Those who'd been summoned against
their will, who were in sight of the girl...


1158
01:31:14.261 --> 01:31:17.681
...were set free, and set right
and sent back from whence they came."


1159
01:31:22.103 --> 01:31:24.771
Mo. Mo!

1160
01:31:31.654 --> 01:31:33.113
Toto?

1161
01:31:36.909 --> 01:31:37.951
Meggie!

1162
01:31:38.911 --> 01:31:41.705
Please, set me free.

1163
01:31:41.872 --> 01:31:44.249
"And the old creator
finally got his wish...


1164
01:31:44.417 --> 01:31:47.085
...disappearing into the world
he had only dreamed about.


1165
01:31:52.133 --> 01:31:56.928
And then, finally, after what seemed
almost a lifetime of wishing...


1166
01:31:58.264 --> 01:32:00.974
...the young girl finally got
her most heartfelt dream.


1167
01:32:01.142 --> 01:32:04.853
While the mother she knew she'd see
again and the father she cherished...


1168
01:32:05.020 --> 01:32:09.149
- Meggie.
...came running to embrace their only..."


1169
01:32:15.948 --> 01:32:17.991
Darling, I missed you.

1170
01:32:24.331 --> 01:32:25.331
What happened?

1171
01:32:26.000 --> 01:32:27.459
I missed it.

1172
01:32:29.336 --> 01:32:31.004
I missed it. They're all gone.

1173
01:32:32.673 --> 01:32:34.340
I got here too late to go home.

1174
01:32:35.176 --> 01:32:37.510
He'll never read me back in now.

1175
01:32:38.012 --> 01:32:40.764
He said he'd try.
After he got his wife back.


1176
01:32:42.349 --> 01:32:46.352
Well, he won't.
He'd never risk losing her again.


1177
01:32:55.529 --> 01:32:57.363
And I wouldn't make him.

1178
01:33:00.701 --> 01:33:05.163
Stop it, Elinor.
It's so silly to cry at happy endings.


1179
01:33:05.790 --> 01:33:06.831
Come here.

1180
01:33:15.216 --> 01:33:16.341
Dustfinger.

1181
01:33:18.719 --> 01:33:20.345
Dustfinger?

1182
01:33:21.680 --> 01:33:24.557
Let's go. Come on, it's time to go.

1183
01:33:25.059 --> 01:33:28.353
- Let's run. Come on. Meggie.
- Meggie, quickly. Come on.


1184
01:33:28.521 --> 01:33:29.854
The book's gone.

1185
01:33:30.022 --> 01:33:33.358
- We don't need it.
- Great. I'll have nightmares for weeks.


1186
01:33:33.692 --> 01:33:35.568
Come on.
Come on.


1187
01:33:40.908 --> 01:33:42.200
You're all right?

1188
01:34:14.108 --> 01:34:16.234
You were going to leave without me?

1189
01:34:16.402 --> 01:34:17.944
Oh, no.

1190
01:34:18.821 --> 01:34:22.115
- You're better off with them.
- Well, if you're going...


1191
01:34:22.616 --> 01:34:24.868
...you should probably
bring this with you.


1192
01:34:37.131 --> 01:34:38.298
You stole this?

1193
01:34:38.465 --> 01:34:41.968
I learned from the best.
I thought maybe we could find someone.


1194
01:34:42.469 --> 01:34:45.638
Another reader.
Someone who could send you back.


1195
01:34:48.309 --> 01:34:49.642
What about that girl?

1196
01:34:50.477 --> 01:34:54.397
You like her, don't you? You come
with me, you may never see her again.


1197
01:34:55.357 --> 01:34:59.110
I stole photo from Silvertongue's pocket.

1198
01:35:06.493 --> 01:35:11.706
Well, if I'm going to be
saddled with you...


1199
01:35:11.874 --> 01:35:13.666
...you can make yourself useful.

1200
01:35:15.961 --> 01:35:17.837
We got a long walk ahead of us.

1201
01:35:22.301 --> 01:35:23.343
Dustfinger.

1202
01:35:27.890 --> 01:35:29.515
Dustfinger!

1203
01:35:34.688 --> 01:35:35.688
I promised.

1204
01:35:37.358 --> 01:35:38.775
It's your turn now.

1205
01:35:39.234 --> 01:35:40.693
Great.

1206
01:35:49.870 --> 01:35:53.247
You sure you want this? You remember
what happens at the end of the book.


1207
01:35:53.415 --> 01:35:56.709
It's like I told the writer.
He doesn't control me.


1208
01:35:56.877 --> 01:35:59.170
My fate's in my own hands now.

1209
01:36:02.424 --> 01:36:03.466
Good luck.

1210
01:36:03.884 --> 01:36:08.137
Hey, don't take this the wrong way,
but don't come back, okay?


1211
01:36:12.393 --> 01:36:13.893
Do it.

1212
01:36:14.770 --> 01:36:15.979
"It had been many years...

1213
01:36:16.146 --> 01:36:20.274
...since Dustfinger had set eyes
on the rolling meadows and the old mill.


1214
01:36:21.276 --> 01:36:24.404
But it was even more beautiful
than he remembered.


1215
01:36:25.364 --> 01:36:27.907
The butterflies flitted above the grass..."

1216
01:36:58.439 --> 01:37:00.148
He's gone back.

1217
01:37:00.607 --> 01:37:01.774
Where he wants to be.

1218
01:37:01.942 --> 01:37:03.526
What about you?

1219
01:37:04.820 --> 01:37:05.945
I can't follow him.

1220
01:37:07.948 --> 01:37:11.284
Because I've kept Gwin behind,
the end of his story will be different.


1221
01:37:11.785 --> 01:37:13.119
He's not going to die.

1222
01:37:14.288 --> 01:37:15.621
You can stay with us.

1223
01:37:17.750 --> 01:37:19.625
It was Mum's idea.

1224
01:37:19.793 --> 01:37:22.462
Sorry. Shouldn't I have said that?

1225
01:37:24.673 --> 01:37:27.133
Just don't expect me to read you back.

1226
01:37:27.760 --> 01:37:30.636
- You can teach me to read?
- Yeah.


1227
01:37:30.804 --> 01:37:32.305
Maybe.

1228
01:37:35.267 --> 01:37:37.101
I can teach you Dragon's Breath.

1229
01:38:04.338 --> 01:38:06.005
Roxanne!

1230
01:38:07.341 --> 01:38:09.050
Roxanne.
