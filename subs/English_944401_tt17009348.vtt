1
00:01:38.397 --> 00:01:39.538
Evening, ma'am.

2
00:01:39.778 --> 00:01:42.799
Your ID and the vehicle's
registration, please.


3
00:02:06.393 --> 00:02:07.454
I'm sorry, officer.

4
00:02:07.494 --> 00:02:10.056
I left it in the dash, and I
don't have anything with me.


5
00:02:10.116 --> 00:02:11.157
I just plumb forgot.

6
00:02:11.778 --> 00:02:14.020
Okay, ma'am, I'll need you to
get out while we search your truck.


7
00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:15.841
Oh, I wouldn't do
that if I were you.

8
00:02:16.582 --> 00:02:19.404
What the fuck is this?

9
00:02:20.225 --> 00:02:21.626
Ma'am, hands up where I can see them.

10
00:02:22.827 --> 00:02:25.190
They won't hurt you as
long as you don't hurt me.


11
00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:28.192
Ma'am, put your hands
on the dashboard now.


12
00:02:30.154 --> 00:02:31.195
Ma'am, are you listening to me?

13
00:02:37.715 --> 00:02:38.676
You got a light officer?

14
00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:53.091
Hello?

15
00:02:55.173 --> 00:02:56.054
What are you talking about?

16
00:02:58.977 --> 00:03:00.118
It's 2 o'clock in the morning.

17
00:03:19.996 --> 00:03:20.536
I have to go.

18
00:03:21.897 --> 00:03:22.838
What's going on?

19
00:03:24.679 --> 00:03:26.500
There's an emergency
at the detention center.


20
00:03:29.161 --> 00:03:31.303
Why do they always have to
call you for these shitty jobs?


21
00:03:31.703 --> 00:03:32.543
I take what they give me.

22
00:03:57.383 --> 00:04:03.246
Isn't that right?

23
00:04:03.326 --> 00:04:03.847
It's too much.

24
00:04:04.447 --> 00:04:05.368
Ma'am, can I help you?

25
00:04:05.928 --> 00:04:06.348
Yes, sir.

26
00:04:06.508 --> 00:04:08.509
I'm here for the
suspect that just arrived.


27
00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:09.830
Here?

28
00:04:11.111 --> 00:04:11.911
In the pink dress.

29
00:04:12.812 --> 00:04:13.252
Oh, yeah.

30
00:04:15.113 --> 00:04:15.373
This one.

31
00:04:15.854 --> 00:04:16.414
Oh, thank you.

32
00:04:28.802 --> 00:04:30.483
I'm going to stay behind
the door, just in case.


33
00:04:30.963 --> 00:04:32.204
Thank you.

34
00:04:32.244 --> 00:04:32.584
Thank you.

35
00:04:33.024 --> 00:04:33.264
Hello.

36
00:04:58.148 --> 00:04:59.409
I'm Dr. Evelyn Decker.

37
00:05:00.589 --> 00:05:01.410
May I ask your name?

38
00:05:13.817 --> 00:05:17.476
Besides the fact that smoking is
bad for your health, I must remind


39
00:05:17.488 --> 00:05:20.781
you that it is quite simply
illegal to smoke on the premises.


40
00:05:21.281 --> 00:05:22.142
Does it bother you?

41
00:05:24.103 --> 00:05:24.543
Not really.

42
00:05:30.852 --> 00:05:31.592
Oh, thank you.

43
00:05:34.413 --> 00:05:36.434
Actually, I'm sorry that
you wasted your time.


44
00:05:38.115 --> 00:05:38.795
I'm not sick.

45
00:05:38.915 --> 00:05:40.816
I'm just tired.

46
00:05:42.997 --> 00:05:45.678
I'm a psychiatrist, to be more specific.

47
00:05:46.398 --> 00:05:46.498
Oh.

48
00:06:04.361 --> 00:06:07.644
I'm here because my colleagues
are struggling to get a handle on you.


49
00:06:08.525 --> 00:06:11.093
They don't quite know
which aisle to put you


50
00:06:11.105 --> 00:06:13.570
in, so they would like
to know who you are.


51
00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:16.332
They don't blame me.

52
00:06:18.094 --> 00:06:20.536
But I always liked disguises.

53
00:06:22.416 --> 00:06:24.797
That's what you do when you
don't really know who you are, right?


54
00:06:25.778 --> 00:06:28.419
You dress up, you make
up a past to forget your own.


55
00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:32.661
Is dressing up equal
lying to yourself, Doctor?


56
00:06:35.442 --> 00:06:35.883
Depends.

57
00:06:36.663 --> 00:06:39.945
Generally, a disguise is used to
conceal what we don't want to see.


58
00:06:42.166 --> 00:06:43.126
That's interesting.

59
00:06:43.907 --> 00:06:46.668
I always thought there was a
way of becoming someone else.


60
00:06:48.129 --> 00:06:50.610
It'd be very pleasant to
forget yourself for a moment,


61
00:06:52.372 --> 00:06:54.413
Even if you know it's only an illusion.

62
00:06:59.296 --> 00:06:59.816
Are you okay?

63
00:07:00.196 --> 00:07:00.676
Oh, yes.

64
00:07:01.677 --> 00:07:02.517
I was just thinking.

65
00:07:07.060 --> 00:07:08.240
Do you love life, Doctor?

66
00:07:09.561 --> 00:07:09.781
Yes.

67
00:07:11.362 --> 00:07:12.482
There are ups and downs.

68
00:07:13.123 --> 00:07:17.276
My family never really had much, but
my parents always wanted the best for


69
00:07:17.288 --> 00:07:21.287
me, so I was able to go to college
and make the most of my life for now.


70
00:07:22.206 --> 00:07:22.986
You found love?

71
00:07:24.647 --> 00:07:24.887
Yes.

72
00:07:26.108 --> 00:07:26.808
I have a little boy.

73
00:07:27.569 --> 00:07:28.409
He's not my soul.

74
00:07:28.869 --> 00:07:29.670
I'm happy for you.

75
00:07:30.230 --> 00:07:30.570
Married?

76
00:07:32.691 --> 00:07:33.092
Divorced.

77
00:07:34.252 --> 00:07:36.033
Life's not a long, quiet river, huh?

78
00:07:37.554 --> 00:07:37.794
Yep.

79
00:07:38.855 --> 00:07:42.116
Well, now that I've answered your
questions, perhaps you'll answer mine.


80
00:07:42.476 --> 00:07:43.457
Oh, yes, sorry.

81
00:07:44.277 --> 00:07:45.078
What was your question?

82
00:07:45.878 --> 00:07:46.479
Just your name.

83
00:07:47.499 --> 00:07:48.580
Doc, short for Douglas.

84
00:07:49.580 --> 00:07:51.241
Nobody's called me
that for a long time now.


85
00:07:51.907 --> 00:07:53.067
Do you have any children, Douglas?

86
00:07:54.688 --> 00:07:55.088
Hundreds.

87
00:07:58.130 --> 00:07:59.370
You're referring to your dogs?

88
00:08:00.030 --> 00:08:00.470
Yes.

89
00:08:00.691 --> 00:08:01.571
They're my babies.

90
00:08:03.132 --> 00:08:04.912
Their love saved me a thousand times.

91
00:08:06.173 --> 00:08:07.013
I owe them my life.

92
00:08:07.934 --> 00:08:11.255
Would you say that you love your
dogs more than you love human beings?


93
00:08:11.575 --> 00:08:12.195
Absolutely.

94
00:08:12.575 --> 00:08:14.836
The more I got to know
humans, the more I love dogs.


95
00:08:16.597 --> 00:08:18.918
What qualities do they
possess that humans don't have?


96
00:08:20.255 --> 00:08:24.202
Dogs have beauty without vanity,
force without insolence, bravery without


97
00:08:24.214 --> 00:08:27.798
ferocity, and all the virtues humans
have without any of the vices.


98
00:08:28.559 --> 00:08:30.920
As far as I can tell,
they only have one flaw.


99
00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:32.701
Which is?

100
00:08:34.501 --> 00:08:35.422
They trust humans.

101
00:08:48.853 --> 00:08:50.913
I was probably nine
when it first occurred to me.


102
00:08:52.434 --> 00:08:55.906
I remember watching my
brother from my bedroom window


103
00:08:55.918 --> 00:08:59.015
as he dangled meat in
front of my father's dogs.


104
00:08:59.995 --> 00:09:04.896
And I watched them both starve
in the days leading to the fight.


105
00:09:05.096 --> 00:09:08.876
That's how my dad earned a
living, was organizing dog fights.


106
00:09:10.977 --> 00:09:13.317
Do you think that he
loved them in his own way?


107
00:09:13.457 --> 00:09:13.697
No.

108
00:09:14.557 --> 00:09:16.278
My father was incapable of love.

109
00:09:17.238 --> 00:09:18.218
He was all violence.

110
00:09:19.515 --> 00:09:22.177
How often did I tell
you not to feed the dog?


111
00:09:22.197 --> 00:09:23.397
How often?

112
00:09:25.238 --> 00:09:25.519
And you?

113
00:09:26.980 --> 00:09:27.540
Oh, me?

114
00:09:29.861 --> 00:09:31.742
I tasted his violence
like everyone else.


115
00:09:35.905 --> 00:09:38.186
Listening to you, I'm
struck by how calm you are.


116
00:09:39.427 --> 00:09:43.489
Did you ever try to defend
yourself or complain at least?


117
00:09:44.630 --> 00:09:45.991
Complaints are prayers to the devil.

118
00:09:48.190 --> 00:09:50.711
Do you have any
recollections of happy times?


119
00:09:51.912 --> 00:09:52.452
Yeah, sure.

120
00:09:54.153 --> 00:10:01.831
When I was little, when
my mom was in the kitchen,


121
00:10:01.843 --> 00:10:09.081
she used to love records
from Europe most often.


122
00:10:09.862 --> 00:10:12.203
And she loved to play
them while she was cooking.


123
00:10:17.016 --> 00:10:19.997
And then my dad came home.

124
00:10:20.897 --> 00:10:25.238
And the show stopped.

125
00:10:30.060 --> 00:10:31.100
Did you know anyone else?

126
00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:32.560
A grandparent?

127
00:10:32.680 --> 00:10:33.821
An aunt or uncle?

128
00:10:34.701 --> 00:10:36.881
Somebody that could show
you some attention or affection?


129
00:10:39.622 --> 00:10:39.922
Yes.

130
00:10:45.044 --> 00:10:46.804
A child takes affection
where he can get it.


131
00:10:54.971 --> 00:10:56.854
And one evening, over dinner, my

132
00:10:56.866 --> 00:10:59.412
brother delightfully
told my father on me.


133
00:11:00.213 --> 00:11:02.593
He puts his food in his
pockets to give to the dogs later?


134
00:11:03.994 --> 00:11:04.214
No.

135
00:11:05.034 --> 00:11:05.614
That's a lie.

136
00:11:06.074 --> 00:11:06.554
I swear.

137
00:11:06.754 --> 00:11:07.195
Cross my heart.

138
00:11:07.475 --> 00:11:07.935
Swear to die.

139
00:11:12.956 --> 00:11:14.257
Now you love dogs, huh?

140
00:11:18.118 --> 00:11:18.518
Yes.

141
00:11:20.058 --> 00:11:20.578
Please.

142
00:11:21.279 --> 00:11:22.039
Not at the table.

143
00:11:24.490 --> 00:11:25.871
More than you love your own family?

144
00:11:34.858 --> 00:11:35.138
I do.

145
00:11:42.124 --> 00:11:43.405
Dogs!

146
00:11:43.425 --> 00:11:43.665
Dogs!

147
00:11:43.805 --> 00:11:44.626
You piece of shit!

148
00:11:52.030 --> 00:11:54.131
Then he took my tears
as an admittance of guilt.


149
00:11:54.991 --> 00:11:58.113
And from that day forward, I was no
longer welcome in my father's house.


150
00:12:01.535 --> 00:12:05.456
Then occasionally...
This is your family now!


151
00:12:33.471 --> 00:12:34.011
And your mother?

152
00:12:34.671 --> 00:12:36.732
Oh, my mother, she did
the only thing she could do.


153
00:12:44.794 --> 00:12:45.534
Some things for you.

154
00:12:47.692 --> 00:12:48.552
You have to bury them.

155
00:12:49.332 --> 00:12:51.073
If your father finds
them, he'll go crazy.


156
00:12:54.754 --> 00:12:57.574
I don't remember exactly what she
said, just her face was red and wet.


157
00:12:58.735 --> 00:12:59.895
And she apologized.

158
00:13:03.856 --> 00:13:04.396
I love you.

159
00:13:06.356 --> 00:13:06.896
Have a sweet.

160
00:13:10.777 --> 00:13:11.458
She was pregnant?

161
00:13:12.078 --> 00:13:13.238
Yeah, seven months.

162
00:13:15.019 --> 00:13:18.082
I guess she wanted to offer her child
a better life than my brother and I's.


163
00:13:19.443 --> 00:13:20.844
Did you ever try to run away?

164
00:13:22.225 --> 00:13:22.705
Or where?

165
00:13:25.948 --> 00:13:28.488
See, on one side of the
pen was the back wall of


166
00:13:28.500 --> 00:13:31.052
a kind of shed, piled
high of all kinds of stuff.


167
00:13:31.552 --> 00:13:36.228
And one day, by scratching at the wood, I
was able to squeeze my tiny hands through


168
00:13:36.240 --> 00:13:40.760
and found a stack of magazines that my
mom had been hiding for no obvious reason.


169
00:13:41.841 --> 00:13:44.703
A little window through which
I could finally see the world.


170
00:13:47.971 --> 00:13:57.540
You see, I got my whole schooling from
Modern Woman and the American Magazine.


171
00:14:01.584 --> 00:14:04.347
Did you ever realize that
your situation wasn't normal?


172
00:14:06.069 --> 00:14:06.909
Yeah, I did.

173
00:14:10.393 --> 00:14:12.495
And how long did
you stay in that cage?

174
00:14:19.801 --> 00:14:20.382
Hard to tell.

175
00:14:21.923 --> 00:14:24.144
Did you resent your mother
for abandoning you like that?


176
00:14:24.484 --> 00:14:24.644
No.

177
00:14:26.065 --> 00:14:26.966
My mother was weak.

178
00:14:27.046 --> 00:14:29.167
It was her biggest flaw
and greatest stroke of luck.


179
00:14:29.768 --> 00:14:32.790
In the wild, the weak are immediately
eliminated, devoured by the others.


180
00:14:33.490 --> 00:14:37.513
But with humans, the weak and
cowardly always find a way to survive.


181
00:14:38.994 --> 00:14:39.935
For a while, at least.

182
00:14:41.375 --> 00:14:45.118
Because in the end, God
always knows his own.


183
00:14:49.302 --> 00:14:50.803
One more, huh, Mommy?

184
00:14:52.625 --> 00:14:53.005
Yeah.

185
00:14:53.605 --> 00:14:54.366
You like that, maybe?

186
00:14:55.367 --> 00:14:55.947
One more bite.

187
00:15:04.494 --> 00:15:05.054
How was work?

188
00:15:07.056 --> 00:15:07.396
Heavy.

189
00:15:12.280 --> 00:15:14.181
So it's Dad crawling around
the neighborhood today.


190
00:15:18.753 --> 00:15:20.134
He's not supposed to be in rehab?

191
00:15:20.775 --> 00:15:21.495
Yes, he is.

192
00:15:24.938 --> 00:15:26.719
I thought the judge forbid
him to come near the house.


193
00:15:27.960 --> 00:15:28.741
Yes, she did.

194
00:15:30.422 --> 00:15:31.223
He can be violent.

195
00:15:33.324 --> 00:15:34.605
Yes, I know that, Mom.

196
00:15:37.788 --> 00:15:38.328
Like your dad.

197
00:15:40.970 --> 00:15:41.491
I know that, too.

198
00:15:54.132 --> 00:15:55.372
I'm not going anywhere, baby.

199
00:16:06.374 --> 00:16:08.634
You know it's your
fault Mom bailing on us.


200
00:16:11.095 --> 00:16:13.555
You made Dad so unhappy
that she couldn't stand it anymore.


201
00:16:14.475 --> 00:16:16.676
Being so pig-headed the whole time.

202
00:16:17.696 --> 00:16:18.996
So misery all around you.

203
00:16:20.356 --> 00:16:21.517
But you're just a lost sheep.

204
00:16:22.497 --> 00:16:23.297
And with God's help,

205
00:16:24.473 --> 00:16:25.954
Dad will get you
back on the right path.

206
00:16:27.736 --> 00:16:29.037
Pray and repent, young pagan.

207
00:16:29.238 --> 00:16:31.023
The wages of sin
is death, but the gift


208
00:16:31.035 --> 00:16:32.921
of God is eternal
life in Christ our Lord.


209
00:16:35.404 --> 00:16:35.664
Got it?

210
00:17:26.660 --> 00:17:28.966
Hi, I'm here to talk to Dogman.

211
00:18:16.726 --> 00:18:17.807
This way, young man.

212
00:18:18.747 --> 00:18:19.588
Don't be afraid.

213
00:18:20.488 --> 00:18:26.051
They won't hurt you.

214
00:18:37.077 --> 00:18:38.978
I apologize, but it's near feeding time.

215
00:18:39.699 --> 00:18:41.400
The agitation is quite high.

216
00:18:48.802 --> 00:18:49.983
You look oddly familiar.

217
00:18:50.383 --> 00:18:50.884
Have we met?

218
00:18:51.664 --> 00:18:56.428
Yeah, I, uh... I came here a few
months ago with my cousin Pablo.


219
00:18:58.170 --> 00:18:59.971
We, uh, we did all the electrical.

220
00:19:00.251 --> 00:19:01.092
One, right?

221
00:19:02.413 --> 00:19:02.693
Yeah.

222
00:19:03.954 --> 00:19:04.295
Yes.

223
00:19:06.957 --> 00:19:08.018
Please, take a seat.

224
00:19:08.178 --> 00:19:08.838
Something to drink?

225
00:19:12.802 --> 00:19:14.003
Uh, it's okay.

226
00:19:14.023 --> 00:19:15.244
I'm not really thirsty.

227
00:19:18.230 --> 00:19:20.032
So what brings you here, Juan?

228
00:19:21.493 --> 00:19:21.994
It's Martha.

229
00:19:23.315 --> 00:19:23.716
Martha.

230
00:19:24.537 --> 00:19:27.139
She very kindly delivers
my laundry from time to time.


231
00:19:28.020 --> 00:19:28.641
A great woman.

232
00:19:29.061 --> 00:19:30.923
Yeah.

233
00:19:30.943 --> 00:19:33.709
Well, she found a
little dog in the street,


234
00:19:33.721 --> 00:19:36.309
you know, and she
thought... Oh, my gosh.


235
00:19:36.369 --> 00:19:38.631
She thought it'd be happier
here, you know, with you.


236
00:19:38.831 --> 00:19:39.172
Really?

237
00:19:40.153 --> 00:19:41.194
What a little marvel.

238
00:19:42.163 --> 00:19:43.584
It's an Australian labradoodle.

239
00:19:44.364 --> 00:19:45.985
You know, most are imported illegally.

240
00:19:46.005 --> 00:19:51.207
Many that go unsold get killed by the
dealers or tossed out the car window.


241
00:19:51.707 --> 00:19:53.428
That's likely what
happened to this little guy.


242
00:19:53.608 --> 00:19:54.749
He's injured his back leg.

243
00:19:55.609 --> 00:19:56.450
Oh, poor thing.

244
00:19:57.630 --> 00:19:58.510
Well, don't you worry.

245
00:19:58.590 --> 00:20:00.731
You fell from heaven
to exactly the right place.


246
00:20:02.532 --> 00:20:03.753
I'm gonna call you gorgeous.

247
00:20:04.533 --> 00:20:04.793
Yes.

248
00:20:05.914 --> 00:20:08.149
Be sure to thank
Martha for me and tell


249
00:20:08.161 --> 00:20:10.576
her if there's anything
I can do, just ask.


250
00:20:13.078 --> 00:20:14.359
Actually, she has a small problem.

251
00:20:17.200 --> 00:20:17.740
Go ahead.

252
00:20:18.800 --> 00:20:20.821
Well, there's a gang
in town led by a guy.


253
00:20:21.201 --> 00:20:22.322
Goes by Edward Adubo.

254
00:20:23.482 --> 00:20:24.142
The executioner.

255
00:20:25.123 --> 00:20:28.364
You just opened the bar
on 3rd Street, is that correct?


256
00:20:28.384 --> 00:20:29.164
Yeah, yeah.

257
00:20:30.765 --> 00:20:31.845
Okay, what about him?

258
00:20:32.385 --> 00:20:34.405
In the last few months,
he's been squeezing store


259
00:20:34.417 --> 00:20:36.367
owners in our neighborhood
for protection money.


260
00:20:38.842 --> 00:20:40.740
We pay up like everybody
else, but the guy, I


261
00:20:40.752 --> 00:20:42.745
mean, he's just bumping
it up almost every week.


262
00:20:42.925 --> 00:20:44.726
Now, Martha can't afford it.

263
00:20:46.768 --> 00:20:48.769
You know, she had to sell
some of her personal furniture.


264
00:20:50.230 --> 00:20:51.431
She inherited it from her folks.

265
00:20:57.255 --> 00:20:58.796
Tell Martha I'll see what I can do.

266
00:20:59.717 --> 00:21:00.017
Thank you.

267
00:21:36.411 --> 00:21:37.877
I'll put it in his mouth.

268
00:21:37.958 --> 00:21:38.801
And then I'll shit on him.

269
00:22:19.655 --> 00:22:19.915
Hello?

270
00:22:20.756 --> 00:22:21.816
Hello, Mr. El Vertigo.

271
00:22:21.856 --> 00:22:24.498
I'm sorry to have to call you by
this name, but it's the only one I have.


272
00:22:26.219 --> 00:22:26.699
Who's this?

273
00:22:27.239 --> 00:22:28.823
Don't worry, I'm not with
the police department,


274
00:22:28.835 --> 00:22:30.301
the feds, or any of your
other known enemies.


275
00:22:30.541 --> 00:22:32.902
Under these circumstances,
in fact, I'm your only friend.


276
00:22:39.206 --> 00:22:41.807
First of all, for your own good
health, I want you to sit still.


277
00:22:42.008 --> 00:22:44.074
It could be very dangerous
for your future, assuming


278
00:22:44.086 --> 00:22:45.850
you're thinking of
starting a family one day.


279
00:22:49.436 --> 00:22:57.318
What's the matter?

280
00:22:58.339 --> 00:22:58.759
Hello?

281
00:23:02.500 --> 00:23:02.880
Hello?

282
00:23:03.941 --> 00:23:04.321
Hello?

283
00:23:05.601 --> 00:23:07.962
Hello?

284
00:23:09.322 --> 00:23:09.982
Hello?

285
00:23:11.763 --> 00:23:12.083
Yes.

286
00:23:12.783 --> 00:23:14.524
Ah, do I have your attention now?

287
00:23:15.944 --> 00:23:16.304
Si.

288
00:23:16.985 --> 00:23:17.445
What's your name?

289
00:23:19.319 --> 00:23:19.840
Morales.

290
00:23:20.321 --> 00:23:21.723
What's your first name, Mr. Morales?

291
00:23:22.264 --> 00:23:22.744
Diego.

292
00:23:23.265 --> 00:23:23.666
Diego?

293
00:23:24.687 --> 00:23:25.008
No.

294
00:23:28.353 --> 00:23:29.474
Do you like children, Diego?

295
00:23:29.915 --> 00:23:30.155
Yes.

296
00:23:30.656 --> 00:23:31.437
You realize you need one?

297
00:23:31.477 --> 00:23:33.300
My dog has its fangs
on the half of them, yes.


298
00:23:35.136 --> 00:23:35.376
Yes.

299
00:23:36.136 --> 00:23:36.696
Here's the deal.

300
00:23:37.577 --> 00:23:40.214
I let you have children, and in
return, you leave the delightful


301
00:23:40.226 --> 00:23:43.078
Martha alone so she too can raise
her children in peace and happiness.


302
00:23:43.358 --> 00:23:44.458
Who the fuck is Martha?

303
00:23:44.798 --> 00:23:47.339
She's an old lady who runs the
laundry on the corner of Sixth Street.


304
00:23:47.379 --> 00:23:49.679
Try taking her your dirty
clothes and not your dirty tricks.


305
00:23:50.239 --> 00:23:52.420
She'll do a fabulous job on them.

306
00:23:52.440 --> 00:23:53.420
How do you like my dear?

307
00:23:54.680 --> 00:23:56.241
I don't get what the fuck you're saying.

308
00:23:57.061 --> 00:23:57.861
I'll sum it up for you.

309
00:23:58.261 --> 00:24:00.008
Quit extorting the
hell out of her or my


310
00:24:00.020 --> 00:24:01.822
dog gobbles your
gonads right this second.


311
00:24:04.863 --> 00:24:05.344
Got it now?

312
00:24:06.024 --> 00:24:06.285
Yes.

313
00:24:06.965 --> 00:24:07.526
We have a deal?

314
00:24:08.387 --> 00:24:09.388
We have a fucking deal.

315
00:24:09.508 --> 00:24:11.485
You realize that breaking
a deal would be in complete


316
00:24:11.497 --> 00:24:13.633
contradiction with your values
and mine, Mr. Morales, yes?


317
00:24:14.154 --> 00:24:14.634
I see.

318
00:24:15.255 --> 00:24:15.676
Wonderful.

319
00:24:16.136 --> 00:24:17.518
Now give the phone
back to Mickey, please.


320
00:24:35.740 --> 00:24:35.941
Let's go!

321
00:24:35.961 --> 00:24:36.241
Let's go!

322
00:24:41.028 --> 00:24:42.237
Don’t just stand there!

323
00:24:43.737 --> 00:24:44.862
Bring him back alive!

324
00:24:45.445 --> 00:24:47.778
Come on, come on.

325
00:25:33.512 --> 00:25:43.512
Speak softly, laugh and hold me warm against
your heart I feel your words, the tender


326
00:25:45.192 --> 00:25:55.192
trembling moments dark We're in a world of our
own Sharing a love that only few have ever known


327
00:26:02.377 --> 00:26:12.377
Wine-colored days warm like the
sun The velvet night when we are one


328
00:26:18.273 --> 00:26:28.273
Speak softly, love, so no one hears us but
the sky The vows of love we made, we'll live


329
00:26:30.035 --> 00:26:40.035
until we die My life is yours, and all because
You came into my world with words so softly


330
00:27:36.181 --> 00:27:38.954
Melvin, it's not me who's stopping
you from seeing your son as the


331
00:27:38.966 --> 00:27:41.584
judge, and you know you're not
supposed to come near the house.


332
00:27:43.085 --> 00:27:44.185
Look, can you stop, please?

333
00:27:44.445 --> 00:27:45.466
You're scaring my mom.

334
00:27:48.751 --> 00:27:50.192
No, I'm not bringing him to the park.

335
00:27:50.232 --> 00:27:52.073
It's not good for me
and it's not good for him.


336
00:27:52.593 --> 00:27:55.214
The best thing for you to do
is take care of yourself, okay?


337
00:27:55.794 --> 00:27:56.114
Hello?

338
00:27:57.455 --> 00:27:57.895
Melvin.

339
00:27:59.316 --> 00:27:59.596
Hello?

340
00:28:01.717 --> 00:28:02.077
Fuck.

341
00:28:09.301 --> 00:28:10.881
Excuse me, no parking, ma'am.

342
00:28:11.982 --> 00:28:12.802
All right, officer, go ahead.

343
00:28:14.303 --> 00:28:14.483
Ma'am?

344
00:28:35.952 --> 00:28:36.232
God.

345
00:28:36.252 --> 00:28:39.654
Did you hear that from... Liam?

346
00:28:39.674 --> 00:28:42.775
Did you hear back from that hole?

347
00:29:09.190 --> 00:29:10.016
Need an escort officer.

348
00:29:10.419 --> 00:29:10.721
Thank you.

349
00:29:49.141 --> 00:29:53.222
I was allowed to go to your house to
bring you some things, as you asked.


350
00:29:53.522 --> 00:29:53.962
Thank you.

351
00:30:01.423 --> 00:30:05.124
It was pretty messy at your place.

352
00:30:06.464 --> 00:30:09.125
Yes, I'm usually very tidy.

353
00:30:15.106 --> 00:30:15.726
You need some help?

354
00:30:29.743 --> 00:30:31.424
Caramel latte with whipped cream, right?

355
00:30:31.765 --> 00:30:32.565
Perfect, thank you.

356
00:30:33.766 --> 00:30:34.347
No, I shouldn't.

357
00:30:34.367 --> 00:30:35.648
Sugar's bad for me.

358
00:30:35.668 --> 00:30:37.261
Cutting out all of
life's little pleasures


359
00:30:37.273 --> 00:30:38.430
is even worse, don't you think?

360
00:30:44.496 --> 00:30:45.396
Must be exhausted.

361
00:30:45.797 --> 00:30:47.118
You only got a few hours sleep.

362
00:30:47.618 --> 00:30:49.180
A good coffee and
I'm ready for anything.


363
00:30:50.366 --> 00:30:55.288
Anyway, your story is very fascinating, and I
still have no news on when and where they're gonna


364
00:30:55.300 --> 00:31:00.489
transfer you, so I would love to ask you a few more
questions about your childhood, if you don't mind.


365
00:31:01.190 --> 00:31:04.070
Well, it's a bit late for
that, don't you think?


366
00:31:04.951 --> 00:31:05.231
Meaning?

367
00:31:05.951 --> 00:31:08.212
To train an animal well, the
earlier you start, the better.


368
00:31:09.792 --> 00:31:11.673
I'm too old to be
retrained, don't you think?


369
00:31:14.581 --> 00:31:18.724
Do you find talking about your
childhood awkward or uncomfortable?


370
00:31:19.345 --> 00:31:19.525
No.

371
00:31:20.166 --> 00:31:21.106
I'm just not used to it.

372
00:31:23.308 --> 00:31:25.350
Actually, it feels like it
probably does me some good.


373
00:31:26.951 --> 00:31:28.552
No one exists without a past, right?

374
00:31:29.133 --> 00:31:31.435
Well, they say the past is
the root that becomes the tree.


375
00:31:31.855 --> 00:31:33.056
True, but roots are invisible.

376
00:31:33.116 --> 00:31:33.817
Why dig them up?

377
00:31:35.238 --> 00:31:36.099
Because it does you good.

378
00:31:37.720 --> 00:31:38.200
Touche.

379
00:31:40.502 --> 00:31:41.363
So what do you want to know?

380
00:31:43.589 --> 00:31:44.970
How did you get out of that cage?

381
00:31:49.672 --> 00:31:50.252
I see them!

382
00:31:50.472 --> 00:31:51.073
Look at this.

383
00:32:06.981 --> 00:32:08.723
Oh, this is great.

384
00:32:08.823 --> 00:32:12.566
Wait and see what Dad's gonna
do to your puppies when he finds out.


385
00:32:12.766 --> 00:32:14.188
He'll make dog food out of them.

386
00:32:14.528 --> 00:32:15.068
Richie, please.

387
00:32:15.989 --> 00:32:16.570
Don't do that.

388
00:32:16.790 --> 00:32:17.090
Or else?

389
00:32:17.170 --> 00:32:18.031
Don't do that, Richie.

390
00:32:18.672 --> 00:32:19.252
Richie, please.

391
00:32:20.113 --> 00:32:22.192
My brother, Richie,
betrayed me once again,


392
00:32:22.204 --> 00:32:24.057
went into the house
and told my father.


393
00:32:43.020 --> 00:32:44.240
My father was a sick man.

394
00:32:44.581 --> 00:32:46.341
He hated the world,
starting with himself.


395
00:32:46.841 --> 00:32:47.882
He didn't love life.

396
00:32:48.502 --> 00:32:50.022
He tried to constantly destroy it.

397
00:32:51.783 --> 00:32:51.943
Move.

398
00:32:51.963 --> 00:32:52.383
No, no.

399
00:32:52.443 --> 00:32:52.923
No, please.

400
00:32:52.943 --> 00:32:53.444
Please.

401
00:32:53.464 --> 00:32:53.724
Move.

402
00:32:53.844 --> 00:32:54.484
I have enough.

403
00:32:54.504 --> 00:32:55.024
I said move.

404
00:32:55.044 --> 00:32:55.684
Move, or I'll get you.

405
00:32:55.704 --> 00:32:56.905
Get the hell out of the way!

406
00:32:57.065 --> 00:32:57.585
Move away!

407
00:32:57.605 --> 00:32:58.065
Move away!

408
00:33:25.413 --> 00:33:34.470
I came out with a shotgun to
prove some kind of point and I


409
00:33:34.482 --> 00:33:44.458
wouldn't get out of the way, the
gun went off and I lost a finger.


410
00:33:50.455 --> 00:33:51.495
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

411
00:33:51.515 --> 00:33:52.336
Dad, Dad, Dad!

412
00:33:52.416 --> 00:33:54.437
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay.

413
00:33:54.477 --> 00:33:55.377
No, stop, stop.

414
00:33:55.417 --> 00:33:56.958
I got this, I
got this, I got this.

415
00:33:56.978 --> 00:33:58.338
Let's go inside, let's go inside.

416
00:33:58.358 --> 00:34:00.679
You didn't do anything,
it's not your fault, okay?


417
00:34:00.699 --> 00:34:01.520
Come on, come on.

418
00:34:01.540 --> 00:34:04.281
No, Dad, Dad, Dad, 
Dad, listen to me.

419
00:34:04.321 --> 00:34:05.381
Go inside, come on, come on.

420
00:34:05.461 --> 00:34:06.682
It's okay, I got this.

421
00:34:06.742 --> 00:34:07.862
It's not your fault, go inside.

422
00:34:07.882 --> 00:34:08.703
Come on, come on.

423
00:34:08.783 --> 00:34:09.623
I got this, okay?

424
00:34:20.668 --> 00:34:20.988
You see?

425
00:34:22.109 --> 00:34:23.170
You refuse to understand.

426
00:34:23.910 --> 00:34:26.912
You refuse to accept the error of your
ways, and you behave like an animal!


427
00:34:29.794 --> 00:34:34.377
You do not deserve
God's love, only his mercy.


428
00:34:38.480 --> 00:34:38.820
Amen.

429
00:35:32.508 --> 00:35:34.049
Moby, you see this?

430
00:35:35.389 --> 00:35:35.750
Car.

431
00:35:38.131 --> 00:35:41.773
I want you to find
them and give them this.


432
00:35:42.513 --> 00:35:43.193
The police car.

433
00:35:43.834 --> 00:35:44.354
You got that?

434
00:35:45.274 --> 00:35:46.215
The car in the back.

435
00:35:46.635 --> 00:35:47.195
Go, Moby.

436
00:35:47.976 --> 00:35:48.456
Go, Moby.

437
00:36:19.551 --> 00:36:26.014
Whoa, chicken mutt.

438
00:36:28.255 --> 00:36:29.116
What's up, little fella?

439
00:36:30.416 --> 00:36:31.757
He looks like he's trying
to tell us something.


440
00:36:32.097 --> 00:36:33.097
Is it one of your informers?

441
00:36:34.798 --> 00:36:35.239
Very funny.

442
00:36:57.090 --> 00:36:58.311
I'm going straight up
to the second floor.


443
00:36:58.411 --> 00:37:02.352
You cover me on the stairs, all right?

444
00:37:02.372 --> 00:37:03.493
Let's go.

445
00:37:03.513 --> 00:37:06.114
Come on.

446
00:37:06.314 --> 00:37:08.235
Let's go upstairs.

447
00:37:08.335 --> 00:37:09.235
Let's go.

448
00:37:09.615 --> 00:37:10.436
Jesus.

449
00:37:10.656 --> 00:37:12.617
We're gonna need backup.

450
00:37:12.797 --> 00:37:13.937
Ambulance and social services.

451
00:37:13.957 --> 00:37:15.818
Come on, let's go.

452
00:37:15.898 --> 00:37:16.598
It's done.

453
00:37:16.738 --> 00:37:17.119
Don't move.

454
00:37:17.139 --> 00:37:18.219
Hands off the gun now!

455
00:37:18.259 --> 00:37:18.719
Get the police!

456
00:37:18.739 --> 00:37:19.980
Put your hands on your head!

457
00:37:22.735 --> 00:37:25.896
That might have been the best day of
my life if by unfortunate coincidence the


458
00:37:25.908 --> 00:37:29.041
bullet hadn't ricocheted off the wall
and launched itself into my spinal cord.


459
00:37:30.002 --> 00:37:33.305
I was free at last, but God had
deprived me of legs to enjoy my freedom.


460
00:37:47.638 --> 00:37:48.639
I do believe in God,

461
00:37:50.150 --> 00:37:52.497
But I think at that point
in my life, the question


462
00:37:52.509 --> 00:37:54.452
I asked myself was,
did God believe in me?


463
00:38:01.634 --> 00:38:03.835
I see you are fitted with
a system of leg braces.


464
00:38:04.676 --> 00:38:05.216
Can you walk?

465
00:38:06.036 --> 00:38:06.376
A bit.

466
00:38:07.377 --> 00:38:09.237
They allow me to take
steps in emergencies.


467
00:38:11.038 --> 00:38:13.239
But the bullet was in a
very delicate position.


468
00:38:14.089 --> 00:38:17.830
And right or wrong, the doctors
didn't want to risk taking it out.


469
00:38:17.870 --> 00:38:21.403
So with every step I take, there's
a chance of my bone marrow


470
00:38:21.415 --> 00:38:24.732
emptying out to the body,
which is not highly recommended.


471
00:38:26.272 --> 00:38:28.852
I can walk, but only to my death.

472
00:38:30.373 --> 00:38:31.793
Very Shakespearean, don't you think?

473
00:38:34.354 --> 00:38:36.474
And your father and your
brother, how long did they get?


474
00:38:36.834 --> 00:38:37.575
Father got 20.

475
00:38:38.675 --> 00:38:40.395
Killed himself two
weeks after his arrest.


476
00:38:41.015 --> 00:38:43.056
I guess he didn't have
my capacity for cage life.


477
00:38:46.913 --> 00:38:47.393
And your brother?

478
00:38:47.773 --> 00:38:48.774
My brother got 12.

479
00:38:48.934 --> 00:38:50.974
Thanks to God and good
behavior, he only served eight.


480
00:38:51.775 --> 00:38:52.835
Did you ever see him again?

481
00:38:54.196 --> 00:38:55.436
Yes, I did.

482
00:38:57.617 --> 00:38:58.757
The day he was released.

483
00:39:03.039 --> 00:39:03.679
These papers?

484
00:39:04.399 --> 00:39:05.099
Get out of here.

485
00:39:11.061 --> 00:39:13.552
They let him out in the
morning, and one of my more


486
00:39:13.564 --> 00:39:15.923
diligent docs, Paulie,
was there waiting for him.

491
00:40:03.570 --> 00:40:04.670
Your dogs killed your brother.

492
00:40:04.850 --> 00:40:05.230
No.

493
00:40:07.091 --> 00:40:12.033
God, in his great wisdom,
put him out of his misery.


494
00:40:19.836 --> 00:40:20.476
Excuse me, ma'am.

495
00:40:22.517 --> 00:40:22.877
Thank you.

496
00:40:23.757 --> 00:40:24.898
Mind if I have a bite to eat?

497
00:40:25.398 --> 00:40:25.738
Please do.

498
00:40:29.049 --> 00:40:31.249
It's not exactly good,
but my appetite's back.


499
00:40:31.269 --> 00:40:34.110
I don't know, maybe it has
something to do with your presence.


500
00:40:35.210 --> 00:40:35.710
That's good.

501
00:40:36.951 --> 00:40:39.438
But as a matter of
procedure, I must tell you


502
00:40:39.450 --> 00:40:41.732
that our conversations
are being recorded.


503
00:40:42.292 --> 00:40:43.612
There's a camera on the ceiling.

504
00:40:44.052 --> 00:40:44.992
Two, actually.

505
00:40:45.512 --> 00:40:45.752
I know.

506
00:40:46.213 --> 00:40:46.673
You want one?

507
00:40:47.873 --> 00:40:48.353
No, thank you.

508
00:40:50.253 --> 00:40:53.454
I see here that, uh, after you
were discharged from the hospital,


509
00:40:53.967 --> 00:40:57.070
You were sent to a care
home, the first of several I see.


510
00:40:58.031 --> 00:40:59.553
Do you have any
recollection of that time?


511
00:41:00.594 --> 00:41:03.684
I swapped out one prison for another,
more spacious and comfortable,


512
00:41:03.696 --> 00:41:06.259
sure, but without my dogs,
my isolation was even greater.


513
00:41:06.739 --> 00:41:07.700
You didn't make any friends?

514
00:41:08.521 --> 00:41:08.721
No.

515
00:41:09.522 --> 00:41:10.964
Dogs have a real sense of family.

516
00:41:12.005 --> 00:41:14.096
Even when they come from
different breeds, they rally


517
00:41:14.108 --> 00:41:16.289
around in the bad times
and form a solid, united entity.


518
00:41:17.539 --> 00:41:19.695
The kids I met in the
homes were already scarred


519
00:41:19.707 --> 00:41:21.521
and beaten by life,
incapable of uniting.


520
00:41:21.982 --> 00:41:24.123
They only listened to
their survival instincts.


521
00:41:25.584 --> 00:41:29.029
When you see dogs love their
friends and bite their enemies,


522
00:41:29.041 --> 00:41:32.328
quite unlike people, you
always have to mix love and hate.


523
00:41:34.309 --> 00:41:36.711
You ever have any
romantic relationships?


524
00:41:42.094 --> 00:41:42.715
That's not true.

525
00:41:43.975 --> 00:41:45.016
There was one, actually.

526
00:41:47.769 --> 00:41:48.270
Selma.

527
00:41:51.894 --> 00:41:52.215
Hello.

528
00:41:53.877 --> 00:41:54.478
Douglas, right?

529
00:41:57.902 --> 00:41:58.483
I'm Selma.

530
00:41:59.063 --> 00:42:00.505
The librarian tells me
you're a great reader.


531
00:42:02.468 --> 00:42:03.289
Have you read this before?

532
00:42:05.832 --> 00:42:06.593
Do you know Shakespeare?

533
00:42:08.228 --> 00:42:11.050
Oh, my God, I'm about
to change your world.


534
00:42:11.450 --> 00:42:14.051
Shakespeare is the
greatest writer of all time.


535
00:42:14.532 --> 00:42:17.214
You can imagine, all these
playwrights are inspired


536
00:42:17.226 --> 00:42:19.454
by this man that wrote
plays 400 years ago.


537
00:42:19.914 --> 00:42:22.756
And the best one, in
my opinion, is Macbeth.


538
00:42:22.976 --> 00:42:25.037
She was a counselor,
taught a drama class.


539
00:42:25.497 --> 00:42:27.572
As beautiful as
the sunbeams, she


540
00:42:27.584 --> 00:42:30.100
could talk about
Shakespeare like nobody.


541
00:42:30.940 --> 00:42:33.222
She taught me how to put on makeup.

542
00:42:34.362 --> 00:42:37.484
She said that if you didn't like your
reflection, you just had to change it.


543
00:42:38.276 --> 00:42:40.087
You know, nothing
proves that the reflection


544
00:42:40.099 --> 00:42:41.638
in the mirror is fake
and we are real.


545
00:42:42.258 --> 00:42:46.301
Maybe the reflection is convinced
that it is reality and we simply copy.


546
00:42:46.981 --> 00:42:48.582
I've never met anyone like her.

547
00:42:50.283 --> 00:42:51.864
Okay, your turn.

548
00:42:52.284 --> 00:42:52.784
Moustache.

549
00:42:54.205 --> 00:42:54.565
I can't.

550
00:42:55.046 --> 00:42:56.246
Of course you can.

551
00:42:56.727 --> 00:42:58.188
You can do anything you want.

552
00:42:58.328 --> 00:43:00.589
You can be a king or a prince.

553
00:43:00.769 --> 00:43:03.691
You can be a beggar or a flower.

554
00:43:04.871 --> 00:43:05.692
Anything you choose.

555
00:43:08.142 --> 00:43:08.782
Okay, okay.

556
00:43:16.306 --> 00:43:19.908
She said the theater was
like a religion, a proposition


557
00:43:19.920 --> 00:43:22.889
that the true believer
experiences as reality.


558
00:43:23.569 --> 00:43:28.952
And remember, if you can play
Shakespeare, you can play anything.


559
00:43:31.510 --> 00:43:34.353
as in truth I speak to you
as if from some high hill.


560
00:43:34.693 --> 00:43:37.001
True, and you kill
me from that high part,


561
00:43:37.013 --> 00:43:39.118
that one harsh word
fall upon my heart.


562
00:43:39.278 --> 00:43:42.822
My ears have not yet drunk a hundred
words of my tongue's utterings yet.


563
00:43:43.183 --> 00:43:44.204
I know the sound.

564
00:43:44.944 --> 00:43:47.988
Art thou not Romeo and Montague?

565
00:43:48.068 --> 00:43:50.951
Neither, fair saint,
if either thee dislike.


566
00:43:54.459 --> 00:43:57.960
My dearest love, Duncan
comes here tonight.


567
00:43:58.200 --> 00:43:59.220
And when goes hence?

568
00:43:59.680 --> 00:44:01.701
Tomorrow, as he purposes.

569
00:44:02.061 --> 00:44:04.701
Oh, never shall some admirer see.

570
00:44:05.041 --> 00:44:06.362
Now, mother, what's the matter?

571
00:44:06.762 --> 00:44:09.282
Hamlet, you have offended your father.

572
00:44:09.803 --> 00:44:11.583
Mother, you have offended my father.

573
00:44:11.923 --> 00:44:15.284
You may indeed say so, for it was
that hand that gave away my heart.


574
00:44:15.544 --> 00:44:16.384
A liberal hand.

575
00:44:16.764 --> 00:44:18.064
The hearts of all gave hands.

576
00:44:18.425 --> 00:44:20.265
But I know heraldry
is hands, not hearts.


577
00:44:20.756 --> 00:44:24.658
My name, dear saint, is hateful to
myself because it is an enemy to thee.


578
00:44:25.139 --> 00:44:27.040
Had I written, 
I would tear the word.

579
00:44:27.260 --> 00:44:27.780
Ramia.

580
00:44:28.300 --> 00:44:35.424
Let all those who love me follow me!

581
00:44:35.945 --> 00:44:41.328
When I was alive at last, I could
fully express myself, my whole body.


582
00:44:42.888 --> 00:44:45.088
I was what I wanted to
be, and the barriers of


583
00:44:45.100 --> 00:44:47.171
reality were dismantled
by makeup and verse.


584
00:44:49.149 --> 00:44:53.282
You see, while the real
world constantly rejected me,


585
00:44:53.294 --> 00:44:57.593
the imaginary one opened its
arms and welcomed me fully.


586
00:44:59.694 --> 00:45:02.916
And in this new kingdom,
Selma was my princess.


587
00:45:04.377 --> 00:45:04.937
You loved her?

588
00:45:06.678 --> 00:45:07.118
Madly.

589
00:45:08.659 --> 00:45:09.179
Did you tell her?

590
00:45:12.161 --> 00:45:14.882
I was getting ready
to, but one day she left.


591
00:45:18.648 --> 00:45:28.648
The theater group in
Boston suburbs had hired her.


592
00:45:35.359 --> 00:45:36.240
I was happy for her.

593
00:45:36.300 --> 00:45:39.342
Her talent deserved far better
than a home for juvenile delinquents.


594
00:45:39.862 --> 00:45:40.463
That's for sure.

595
00:45:41.724 --> 00:45:42.744
Did you lose track of her?

596
00:45:44.045 --> 00:45:45.186
I followed her every step.

597
00:45:52.306 --> 00:45:55.007
She struggled to begin with.

598
00:45:55.047 --> 00:46:02.089
But Selma had too much
talent and love not to succeed.


599
00:46:24.718 --> 00:46:27.321
Very soon, she started working
with more professional outfits,


600
00:46:27.333 --> 00:46:29.740
and within a few years, she
worked her way up to Broadway.


601
00:46:48.707 --> 00:46:53.409
And eventually, I was able to
get the courage to go and see her.


602
00:46:55.961 --> 00:46:57.262
She was beautiful.

603
00:47:14.551 --> 00:47:17.340
And I asked one of
the security guards if I


604
00:47:17.352 --> 00:47:19.834
could go backstage,
and he let me come.


605
00:47:21.695 --> 00:47:21.955
Come in.

606
00:47:22.954 --> 00:47:23.975
Sorry to bother you, Selma.

607
00:47:23.995 --> 00:47:24.695
There's someone here.

608
00:47:24.775 --> 00:47:26.216
Says he's your number one fan.

609
00:47:26.256 --> 00:47:27.437
He knows you, and can he say hi?

610
00:47:28.378 --> 00:47:28.658
Sure.

611
00:47:29.638 --> 00:47:32.080
I was absolutely terrified that
she wouldn't remember me.


612
00:47:33.061 --> 00:47:33.581
But she did.

613
00:47:34.021 --> 00:47:34.462
Instantly.

614
00:47:35.382 --> 00:47:36.103
Oh, my gosh.

615
00:47:36.403 --> 00:47:37.083
Douglas!

616
00:47:38.404 --> 00:47:38.965
Douglas!

617
00:47:39.265 --> 00:47:42.187
I'm one of yours!

618
00:47:43.087 --> 00:47:44.568
Look how you've grown!

619
00:47:44.668 --> 00:47:45.529
Are you kidding?

620
00:47:45.549 --> 00:47:46.830
Look at this outfit!

621
00:47:46.870 --> 00:47:48.151
Decked out like a prince!

622
00:47:48.890 --> 00:47:52.212
I wanted to throw these to you at the
end, but I was scared for my position.


623
00:47:52.252 --> 00:47:53.232
They wouldn't hit the stage.

624
00:47:53.312 --> 00:47:54.213
They're beautiful.

625
00:47:54.973 --> 00:47:56.274
Come on, let's go
get them in a vase.

626
00:47:56.794 --> 00:47:57.755
This is amazing.

627
00:47:57.795 --> 00:48:00.356
I was only thinking about you the other
day, wondering what happened to you.


628
00:48:00.376 --> 00:48:02.417
I'm warning you, 
I want the full story.

629
00:48:02.477 --> 00:48:02.957
Shoot.

630
00:48:05.038 --> 00:48:05.439
Okay.

631
00:48:06.679 --> 00:48:07.640
Well, I kept reading.

632
00:48:07.800 --> 00:48:09.521
That could be what I do best.

633
00:48:10.585 --> 00:48:12.627
Then I passed a number of exams.

634
00:48:13.187 --> 00:48:14.328
I did a college course.

635
00:48:14.428 --> 00:48:15.469
Ah, fantastico.

636
00:48:15.489 --> 00:48:16.570
You must have made friends there.

637
00:48:16.890 --> 00:48:18.331
No, it was an online course.

638
00:48:19.272 --> 00:48:22.074
The campus was too far
from the home I was in.


639
00:48:22.535 --> 00:48:24.733
I only went once a
month for exams and stuff,


640
00:48:24.745 --> 00:48:26.858
but it didn't stop me
from getting my B.S.C.


641
00:48:26.918 --> 00:48:27.599
in biology.

642
00:48:28.019 --> 00:48:28.700
A B.S.C.?

643
00:48:28.720 --> 00:48:30.261
That's really good.

644
00:48:30.682 --> 00:48:31.842
What was your dissertation about?

645
00:48:32.303 --> 00:48:32.683
Dogs.

646
00:48:33.484 --> 00:48:33.604
Ah.

647
00:48:34.785 --> 00:48:35.465
I should have guessed.

648
00:48:35.485 --> 00:48:37.107
You were always talking
about them back then.


649
00:48:37.367 --> 00:48:38.508
Look, they're beautiful.

650
00:48:39.920 --> 00:48:42.401
Not as beautiful as you.

651
00:48:42.482 --> 00:48:43.062
So sweet.

652
00:48:43.602 --> 00:48:44.963
And acting, you kept up with it?

653
00:48:45.223 --> 00:48:45.583
A bit.

654
00:48:47.244 --> 00:48:48.945
It's not really the same
without you, though.


655
00:48:49.305 --> 00:48:49.906
I hope so.

656
00:48:55.589 --> 00:48:57.510
But I followed your
career from the beginning.


657
00:48:57.950 --> 00:48:58.291
Really?

658
00:48:59.151 --> 00:49:01.491
Look, I cut out every
article I could find


659
00:49:01.503 --> 00:49:03.854
since your very first
production in Boston.


660
00:49:04.054 --> 00:49:04.654
You did this?

661
00:49:05.395 --> 00:49:05.675
For you.

662
00:49:32.778 --> 00:49:33.258
You like it?

663
00:49:47.390 --> 00:49:50.053
This is the most beautiful gift
anyone has given me in a long time.


664
00:49:53.936 --> 00:49:57.319
And she seemed genuinely
happy that I was there.


665
00:50:01.310 --> 00:50:01.610
Come in.

666
00:50:02.090 --> 00:50:02.611
What a show.

667
00:50:03.271 --> 00:50:03.992
Ah, thank you.

668
00:50:04.372 --> 00:50:04.832
They loved it.

669
00:50:05.272 --> 00:50:05.713
Thank you.

670
00:50:06.213 --> 00:50:10.275
Douglas, this is Bradley, my director,
who also happens to be my husband.


671
00:50:11.556 --> 00:50:11.956
Hey, Doug.

672
00:50:12.537 --> 00:50:13.477
I heard a lot about you, man.

673
00:50:14.558 --> 00:50:14.898
Cool.

674
00:50:15.278 --> 00:50:17.660
He's also the future daddy of my baby.

675
00:50:24.904 --> 00:50:25.304
Douglas.

676
00:50:28.306 --> 00:50:29.187
Congratulations.

677
00:50:29.247 --> 00:50:30.908
How long have you been...

678
00:50:31.535 --> 00:50:31.955
Two weeks.

679
00:50:33.255 --> 00:50:33.536
Really?

680
00:50:33.576 --> 00:50:35.756
That's fast.

681
00:50:35.836 --> 00:50:36.856
You're already pregnant.

682
00:50:36.896 --> 00:50:39.377
You mean Bradley?

683
00:50:39.957 --> 00:50:42.129
No, we met three years
ago and took our time getting


684
00:50:42.141 --> 00:50:44.078
to know each other and
got married last winter.


685
00:50:44.639 --> 00:50:46.799
And the baby really is new.

686
00:50:47.399 --> 00:50:48.480
You're one of the first to know.

687
00:50:48.900 --> 00:50:50.040
I haven't even told my family yet.

688
00:50:53.421 --> 00:50:55.782
I'm... I'm flattered.

689
00:51:03.830 --> 00:51:05.912
Look, babe, Douglas made this for me.

690
00:51:06.353 --> 00:51:06.633
Really?

691
00:51:06.713 --> 00:51:08.715
He kept every article
about me since I started out.


692
00:51:09.556 --> 00:51:09.916
Wow.

693
00:51:10.737 --> 00:51:11.398
Isn't it adorable?

694
00:51:11.538 --> 00:51:12.239
It's beautiful.

695
00:51:13.800 --> 00:51:15.642
That's true artistry, man.

696
00:51:16.803 --> 00:51:18.265
Wow, wow, wow.

697
00:51:19.566 --> 00:51:21.528
So you're a member of the Klan, right?

698
00:51:21.808 --> 00:51:22.869
You're in the artistic family?

699
00:51:23.010 --> 00:51:23.690
You're in the show business?

700
00:51:24.511 --> 00:51:24.731
No.

701
00:51:25.652 --> 00:51:26.994
I'm in the dog business.

702
00:51:33.264 --> 00:51:35.227
So that evening, I
went back to the shelter


703
00:51:35.239 --> 00:51:37.349
where I'd been working
for the past five years.


704
00:51:39.592 --> 00:51:43.097
I felt so, so stupid.

705
00:51:45.860 --> 00:51:51.568
And she was older,
gorgeous, and successful.


706
00:51:54.582 --> 00:51:59.170
I was just this guy in a
wheelchair who, even if


707
00:51:59.182 --> 00:52:03.689
he could walk, I would
have no idea where to go.


708
00:52:10.935 --> 00:52:14.617
How could I think for one second
that she felt anything but pity for me?


709
00:52:35.581 --> 00:52:35.741
No!

710
00:53:30.045 --> 00:53:35.067
Their love for me was so genuine, true,
pure, without any trickery or pretense.


711
00:53:36.548 --> 00:53:38.849
Dogs never lie when
they talk about love.


712
00:53:43.734 --> 00:53:44.795
What happened next?

713
00:53:44.875 --> 00:53:45.255
I adapt.

714
00:53:45.295 --> 00:53:45.475
Again.

715
00:54:44.451 --> 00:54:45.692
I'm sorry, I don't understand.

716
00:54:45.732 --> 00:54:47.493
You want to shut down the shelter?

717
00:54:48.273 --> 00:54:50.287
The state is running a
huge deficit and the new


718
00:54:50.299 --> 00:54:52.535
governor has launched a
drastic cost-cutting program.


719
00:54:53.256 --> 00:54:55.877
Funding to your organization
has been stopped.


720
00:54:57.169 --> 00:55:00.933
The funding I receive has been cut in half
every year for the last three years, but


721
00:55:00.945 --> 00:55:04.632
thanks to donations and regularly placing
dogs, we cost the state next to nothing.


722
00:55:05.852 --> 00:55:07.392
You have done remarkable work.

723
00:55:07.532 --> 00:55:09.760
We fully understand
that, but we have received


724
00:55:09.772 --> 00:55:12.154
numerous complaints for
various kinds of nuisance.


725
00:55:12.614 --> 00:55:13.915
Oh, nuisance such as?

726
00:55:14.375 --> 00:55:16.516
Such as odors.

727
00:55:18.656 --> 00:55:21.497
City Hall have decided to
sell the land to a developer.


728
00:55:22.057 --> 00:55:23.858
Oh, so it's all about money.

729
00:55:26.128 --> 00:55:28.049
We're just carrying
out orders, you know?


730
00:55:28.129 --> 00:55:28.769
Yes, I know.

731
00:55:31.671 --> 00:55:32.831
And what happens to the dogs?

732
00:55:32.911 --> 00:55:35.573
We release them and ask them
kindly to go back to their families.


733
00:55:36.193 --> 00:55:38.534
I guess they'll be taken
to a more suitable facility.


734
00:55:39.214 --> 00:55:40.075
I know what that's like.

735
00:55:40.695 --> 00:55:43.616
Going from home to home and never
getting a shot at rebuilding your life.


736
00:55:44.937 --> 00:55:46.398
Your record here is beyond reproach.

737
00:55:46.498 --> 00:55:50.099
I am sure social services will
soon find you another position.


738
00:55:54.341 --> 00:55:55.242
So when's the big day?

739
00:55:58.640 --> 00:56:00.661
In theory, Monday morning, 6 a.m.

740
00:56:01.442 --> 00:56:02.782
We can ask them for
more time if you like.


741
00:56:03.583 --> 00:56:04.323
Get you an extension.

742
00:56:06.525 --> 00:56:07.045
Thank you, though.

743
00:56:10.407 --> 00:56:11.548
I'll see you on Monday.

744
00:56:15.250 --> 00:56:17.031
Okay, uh, Monday.

745
00:56:24.129 --> 00:56:24.830
Good morning, sir.

746
00:56:24.930 --> 00:56:25.350
Good morning.

747
00:56:25.890 --> 00:56:27.111
Firstly, we bring out the manager.

748
00:56:27.171 --> 00:56:28.092
The guy's in a wheelchair.

749
00:56:28.672 --> 00:56:29.513
It's a bit of an oddball.

750
00:56:30.013 --> 00:56:30.994
And we take care of the dogs.

751
00:56:31.495 --> 00:56:31.855
Understood.

752
00:56:31.875 --> 00:56:41.182
What the fuck?

753
00:57:25.913 --> 00:57:26.894
We'll be okay here.

754
00:57:28.175 --> 00:57:29.517
Polly, tell the others, okay?

755
00:57:52.435 --> 00:57:54.818
Call me beloved,
and I'll be your baptist.


756
00:57:54.898 --> 00:57:57.642
Henceforth I never will be Romeo.

757
00:57:57.662 --> 00:58:01.347
What man art thou that's bescreened
in night so stumblest on my counsel?


758
00:58:02.168 --> 00:58:04.531
By a name I know not
how to tell thee who I am.


759
00:58:05.533 --> 00:58:07.976
What's in a name that
which we call a rose?


760
00:58:09.931 --> 00:58:12.013
by any other word would smell as sweet.

761
00:58:12.914 --> 00:58:16.701
So Romeo would, were he
not Romeo called, retain that


762
00:58:16.713 --> 00:58:20.160
dear perfection which
he owes without that title.


763
00:58:20.980 --> 00:58:23.848
Romeo, doff thy
name, and for thy name,


764
00:58:23.860 --> 00:58:26.885
which is no part of
thee, take all myself.


765
00:58:29.147 --> 00:58:30.568
I take thee at thy word.

766
00:58:32.090 --> 00:58:34.992
Call me but love, and
I'll be new baptized.


767
00:58:35.192 --> 00:58:37.254
Henceforth, I never will be Romeo.

768
00:58:42.232 --> 00:58:43.433
Did you ever see Selma again?

769
00:58:44.033 --> 00:58:44.213
No.

770
00:58:45.433 --> 00:58:47.074
She had two children
in quick succession.


771
00:58:47.635 --> 00:58:48.335
She quit acting.

772
00:58:48.375 --> 00:58:49.475
Her husband turned to beer.

773
00:58:50.276 --> 00:58:51.776
Even the stars fade
and go out in the end.


774
00:58:53.217 --> 00:58:55.778
The place where you were
living, it was pretty well-equipped.


775
00:58:56.158 --> 00:58:56.879
How did you do that?

776
00:58:57.499 --> 00:58:58.099
I help people.

777
00:58:58.139 --> 00:58:58.920
People help me back.

778
00:58:59.540 --> 00:59:02.221
Yes, but it must have
cost a lot of money, right?


779
00:59:02.481 --> 00:59:02.741
True.

780
00:59:03.042 --> 00:59:04.282
To begin with, it was difficult.

781
00:59:04.302 --> 00:59:05.403
I had to pick up a job.

782
00:59:06.963 --> 00:59:08.104
But I had trouble finding one.

783
00:59:09.592 --> 00:59:10.897
My biology degree couldn't even

784
00:59:10.909 --> 00:59:12.694
open the doors to a
fast food restaurant.


785
00:59:14.895 --> 00:59:18.356
Oh, but you don't smell
the flowers, do you?


786
00:59:18.697 --> 00:59:19.177
It's my flowers.

787
00:59:19.197 --> 00:59:19.777
I pay for them.

788
00:59:21.178 --> 00:59:24.620
Sweet dreams are made of this.

789
00:59:24.660 --> 00:59:27.961
Who am I to disagree?

790
00:59:28.321 --> 00:59:31.423
I travel the world and the seven seas.

791
00:59:31.443 --> 00:59:33.284
Sorry, we don't have anything right now.

792
00:59:33.384 --> 00:59:33.744
Let's go back.

793
00:59:33.764 --> 00:59:35.705
Everybody is looking for something.

794
00:59:36.125 --> 00:59:37.186
Some of them want it.

795
00:59:38.139 --> 00:59:38.480
Bye.

796
01:00:08.994 --> 01:00:09.536
You're heaven.

797
01:00:41.173 --> 01:00:44.716
I travel the world and the seven seas.

798
01:00:45.516 --> 01:00:49.359
Everybody's looking for something.

799
01:00:49.399 --> 01:00:52.421
Sweet dreams are made of this.

800
01:00:52.601 --> 01:00:54.322
Who am I to disagree?

801
01:00:54.342 --> 01:00:56.924
I travel the world and the seven seas.

802
01:00:56.944 --> 01:00:59.065
Everybody's looking for something.

803
01:01:07.972 --> 01:01:08.753
Beautiful, Annie.

804
01:01:08.953 --> 01:01:09.313
Beautiful.

805
01:01:09.493 --> 01:01:10.693
Thank you, Annie.

806
01:01:11.074 --> 01:01:14.115
Cher, you were on just after this
number and before the magician.


807
01:01:14.735 --> 01:01:18.157
This is to my favor.

808
01:01:18.277 --> 01:01:19.797
Oh.

809
01:01:21.318 --> 01:01:23.459
Um... Rodney?

810
01:01:25.840 --> 01:01:26.080
Yes?

811
01:01:27.101 --> 01:01:28.561
I came about the ad at the door.

812
01:01:29.101 --> 01:01:30.802
Sorry, I'm... Oh, the bar job.

813
01:01:30.822 --> 01:01:31.502
We found someone.

814
01:01:31.522 --> 01:01:31.923
I'm sorry.

815
01:01:31.963 --> 01:01:33.663
I forgot to take
the ad off the door.

816
01:01:33.723 --> 01:01:34.244
I'm sorry.

817
01:01:34.284 --> 01:01:34.764
Have a good day.

818
01:01:37.108 --> 01:01:39.590
Actually, I was thinking
maybe another job.


819
01:01:39.870 --> 01:01:41.091
I'm an artist, too, you see.

820
01:01:41.611 --> 01:01:42.911
You mean, like, do an act?

821
01:01:44.892 --> 01:01:46.373
I know all of Shakespeare by heart.

822
01:01:47.314 --> 01:01:48.534
Kid, you're in the wrong theater.

823
01:01:48.574 --> 01:01:49.435
This is a drag show.

824
01:01:49.475 --> 01:01:52.367
No, I understand,
but I'm... If you can


825
01:01:52.379 --> 01:01:55.718
perform Shakespeare,
you can perform anything.


826
01:01:57.199 --> 01:02:01.441
I also know a whole repertoire of old
songs, so I have that to offer as well.


827
01:02:03.162 --> 01:02:04.883
I'm sure you can't
perform, but get this.


828
01:02:06.091 --> 01:02:07.781
Folks come here
to have fun, not to


829
01:02:07.793 --> 01:02:09.732
watch some cross-dresser
in a wheelchair.


830
01:02:11.533 --> 01:02:12.173
I can stand.

831
01:02:22.356 --> 01:02:30.298
For one song.

832
01:02:39.092 --> 01:02:40.272
Rodney, come on.

833
01:02:40.812 --> 01:02:41.633
Give him a chance.

834
01:02:41.713 --> 01:02:42.593
Just give him a little one.

835
01:02:42.613 --> 01:02:42.913
He stood.

836
01:02:43.293 --> 01:02:44.593
Come on, Rodney, please.

837
01:02:44.613 --> 01:02:45.894
Oh, for me.

838
01:02:45.934 --> 01:02:46.454
No, he stood.

839
01:02:46.474 --> 01:02:46.614
Come on.

840
01:02:46.634 --> 01:02:47.534
Look at him.

841
01:02:47.894 --> 01:02:47.994
Yes.

842
01:02:48.034 --> 01:02:48.314
One night.

843
01:02:48.614 --> 01:02:48.794
Yes.

844
01:02:49.174 --> 01:02:50.855
Does he love me?

845
01:02:50.875 --> 01:02:52.235
I want to know.

846
01:02:52.255 --> 01:02:55.276
How will I know if he loves me?

847
01:02:55.376 --> 01:02:57.796
So is it in his eyes?

848
01:02:58.137 --> 01:03:00.057
Oh, no, you'll be deceived.

849
01:03:00.197 --> 01:03:01.657
Is it in his smile?

850
01:03:02.038 --> 01:03:03.378
Oh, no, you'll never believe it.

851
01:03:03.398 --> 01:03:03.898
The big reveal.

852
01:03:05.627 --> 01:03:08.282
Girls, the crowd tonight
is a little quiet, so if we


853
01:03:08.294 --> 01:03:10.810
could just bring up the
energy, that'd be perfect.


854
01:03:10.850 --> 01:03:11.370
Cher?

855
01:03:11.570 --> 01:03:11.790
Huh?

856
01:03:11.970 --> 01:03:13.071
Could you shut up for a second?

857
01:03:13.371 --> 01:03:13.711
Wow.

858
01:03:14.611 --> 01:03:14.952
Rude.

859
01:03:16.812 --> 01:03:18.213
Douglas, you're on in two minutes.

860
01:03:20.154 --> 01:03:20.814
You look beautiful.

861
01:03:21.635 --> 01:03:22.095
Thank you.

862
01:03:27.097 --> 01:03:28.218
I thought you couldn't
walk without those.


863
01:03:28.238 --> 01:03:29.078
I can't.

864
01:03:29.899 --> 01:03:32.920
But I can stand still... for a moment.

865
01:03:36.276 --> 01:03:37.898
Just don't leave me
over there at the end.


866
01:03:38.979 --> 01:03:40.000
No, of course not.

867
01:03:40.400 --> 01:03:41.681
As soon as the song is over.

868
01:03:41.982 --> 01:03:43.343
I need you to be
there to pick me up.

869
01:03:43.583 --> 01:03:44.084
Promise me.

870
01:03:44.304 --> 01:03:45.325
I promise you I'll be there.

871
01:03:51.194 --> 01:03:52.856
Give it up for our fantastic magician.

872
01:03:52.896 --> 01:03:54.277
Wasn't he incredible?

873
01:03:54.778 --> 01:03:57.439
Unfortunately, though, our
magician will be taking a short


874
01:03:57.451 --> 01:03:59.943
sabbatical after the teeniest
and tiniest of incidents.


875
01:03:59.963 --> 01:04:00.804
Just relax.

876
01:04:00.824 --> 01:04:01.665
Just relax.

877
01:04:01.745 --> 01:04:02.606
Just relax.

878
01:04:02.666 --> 01:04:05.629
Next up for you, we have
something you've never seen before.


879
01:04:05.930 --> 01:04:07.631
A completely new kind of... Yeah.

880
01:04:07.671 --> 01:04:08.252
Okay.

881
01:04:08.612 --> 01:04:08.853
Okay.

882
01:04:08.953 --> 01:04:09.654
One, two... Okay.

883
01:04:14.258 --> 01:04:15.620
We'll be right here.

884
01:04:15.680 --> 01:04:16.881
Okay.

885
01:04:16.901 --> 01:04:18.362
Good luck.

886
01:04:18.382 --> 01:04:23.812
Now, without further
ado, let me welcome to the


887
01:04:23.824 --> 01:04:29.152
stage the French diva
herself, Miss Edith Piaf!


888
01:04:46.162 --> 01:04:46.983
Oh, my God.

889
01:04:47.244 --> 01:04:48.426
My words as well.

890
01:05:04.831 --> 01:05:14.831
Je revois la ville en fête et en délire Suffoquant sous le soleil et sous la joie Et
j'entends dans la musique les cris et les rires Qui éclatent et rebondissent autour de


891
01:05:18.842 --> 01:05:28.842
moi Et perdu parmi ces gens qui me pousculent Et tout dit, désemparé, je reste là
Quand soudain je me retourne, ils se reculent Et la foule vient me jeter entre ses bras


892
01:05:35.043 --> 01:05:39.525
Emportés par la foule qui nous
traîne, nous entraîne, écrasés


893
01:05:39.537 --> 01:05:43.452
l'un contre l'autre, nous
ne formons qu'un seul corps.


894
01:05:44.173 --> 01:05:47.537
Et le flot, sans effort, nous
pousse à enchaîner l'un et


895
01:05:47.549 --> 01:05:51.281
l'autre, et nous laisse tous deux
épanouis, enivrés et heureux.


896
01:05:52.642 --> 01:06:00.497
Entraînés par la foule qui s'élance et qui danse Une
folle par en dehors de nos deux mains reste soudée


897
01:06:00.509 --> 01:06:07.923
Et parfois soulevés, nos deux corps enlacés
s'envolent Et retombent tous deux épanouis en y briser


898
01:06:23.114 --> 01:06:29.869
Et la joie que l'a poussée par son sourire Me
transperce et rejaillit au fond de mon âme Mais


899
01:06:29.881 --> 01:06:36.648
soudain je poussais un cri parmi les rires Quand
la foule vient l'arracher d'entendre mes bras


900
01:06:38.927 --> 01:06:42.935
Emportée par la foule qui
nous traîne, nous entraîne,


901
01:06:42.947 --> 01:06:47.190
nous éloigne l'un de l'autre,
je lutte et je me débarque.


902
01:06:48.071 --> 01:06:51.430
Mais le son de ma voix
s'écouffe dans le rire des autres


903
01:06:51.442 --> 01:06:54.813
et je crie de douleur, de
fureur et de rage et je pleure.


904
01:08:06.558 --> 01:08:06.999
The garden!

905
01:08:07.259 --> 01:08:13.907
Close the curtain.

906
01:08:13.947 --> 01:08:15.068
Douglas, come here.

907
01:08:15.088 --> 01:08:15.529
Come here, please.

908
01:08:15.569 --> 01:08:16.630
Are you all right?

909
01:08:16.650 --> 01:08:18.232
Are you all right?

910
01:08:18.252 --> 01:08:19.453
This is why you don't trust the garden.

911
01:08:22.622 --> 01:08:23.643
So, you were a hit?

912
01:08:23.943 --> 01:08:25.544
Well, let's not exaggerate.

913
01:08:25.904 --> 01:08:27.973
I was sufficiently
convincing for the boss


914
01:08:27.985 --> 01:08:30.066
to hire me once a
week, every Friday night.


915
01:08:30.726 --> 01:08:33.048
I have to admit, I couldn't
wait for Friday to come around.


916
01:08:33.728 --> 01:08:35.791
It was my only moment
where my reflection


917
01:08:35.803 --> 01:08:37.730
succeeded in making
me forget my image.


918
01:08:39.051 --> 01:08:41.552
So, the show was your
only source of income?


919
01:08:41.893 --> 01:08:42.133
No.

920
01:08:42.873 --> 01:08:44.034
I was a kind of matchmaker.

921
01:08:44.074 --> 01:08:45.802
I'd study the profile
of the client and


922
01:08:45.814 --> 01:08:47.816
suggest companions
that had similar interests.


923
01:08:48.517 --> 01:08:50.965
Your main activity was
placing dogs in homes with


924
01:08:50.977 --> 01:08:53.339
people who were looking
to break their solitude?


925
01:08:53.439 --> 01:08:54.080
Yeah, mostly.

926
01:08:54.480 --> 01:08:54.920
Mostly?

927
01:08:55.140 --> 01:08:55.760
What does that mean?

928
01:08:56.181 --> 01:08:58.101
I also offered protection services.

929
01:08:58.321 --> 01:09:02.563
And how big were these protection
services in your business plan?


930
01:09:02.844 --> 01:09:04.844
People want to be loved and protected.

931
01:09:05.745 --> 01:09:07.866
That's all anybody's
praying for all day long.


932
01:09:08.386 --> 01:09:10.287
But I'm guessing the pay
was nowhere near enough.


933
01:09:10.427 --> 01:09:13.128
You still needed money to
rebuild and look after your dogs.


934
01:09:13.528 --> 01:09:15.469
Well, the answer came
from my dogs, actually.


935
01:09:15.809 --> 01:09:16.050
How?

936
01:09:16.450 --> 01:09:16.870
What do you mean?

937
01:09:17.869 --> 01:09:21.081
Not only were they my
best friends, my most faithful


938
01:09:21.093 --> 01:09:24.013
companions, but they
also understood everything.


939
01:09:25.053 --> 01:09:27.435
Absolutely everything I told them.

940
01:09:34.019 --> 01:09:34.659
Plain flour?

941
01:09:42.364 --> 01:09:42.744
Thank you.

942
01:09:43.965 --> 01:09:44.485
I'm gonna need...

943
01:09:49.262 --> 01:09:50.843
250 grams unsalted butter.

944
01:09:54.484 --> 01:09:57.725
Thank you.

945
01:09:59.166 --> 01:10:00.706
And two large eggs.

946
01:10:05.128 --> 01:10:11.951
Thank you.

947
01:10:15.212 --> 01:10:15.572
Thank you.

948
01:10:18.160 --> 01:10:19.837
Be a darling and fetch me some sugar.

949
01:11:01.040 --> 01:11:02.386
We're gonna make a very nice cake.

950
01:12:16.029 --> 01:12:17.770
I believe in the
redistribution of wealth.


951
01:12:18.290 --> 01:12:19.416
Do you know that the 100 richest

952
01:12:19.428 --> 01:12:20.992
people are richer
than the poorest billion?


953
01:12:21.312 --> 01:12:22.272
Yes, I do.

954
01:12:22.412 --> 01:12:24.125
It's outrageous, but
that doesn't mean


955
01:12:24.137 --> 01:12:25.994
that your actions are
not against the law.


956
01:12:26.274 --> 01:12:28.175
Laws are written by the
rich to control the poor.


957
01:12:28.195 --> 01:12:29.956
It should be the other way
around, don't you think?


958
01:12:30.196 --> 01:12:30.637
You're right.

959
01:12:31.117 --> 01:12:32.838
But that doesn't mean
you get to be judge and jury.


960
01:12:35.539 --> 01:12:36.420
I suppose you're right.

961
01:12:38.041 --> 01:12:38.741
I plead guilty.

962
01:12:48.517 --> 01:12:50.858
If you were earning a living,
why continue stealing like that?


963
01:12:51.839 --> 01:12:52.399
For the kicks?

964
01:12:52.559 --> 01:12:52.839
No.

965
01:12:53.120 --> 01:12:53.740
Far from it.

966
01:12:54.040 --> 01:12:57.630
I think that when society rejects a
child, makes them an outcast, they take


967
01:12:57.642 --> 01:13:01.624
everything that was never given to them as
a way of making amends for the injustice.


968
01:13:02.145 --> 01:13:04.686
Don't you think your explanation
is just a play on words?


969
01:13:05.166 --> 01:13:06.947
I mean, a delinquent
is a delinquent, right?


970
01:13:06.987 --> 01:13:08.468
Nobody is born a delinquent.

971
01:13:08.989 --> 01:13:11.030
You become one through circumstance.

972
01:13:11.370 --> 01:13:12.763
God had wanted
he could have made


973
01:13:12.775 --> 01:13:14.552
me a pianist, a florist,
or a doctor, even.


974
01:13:14.592 --> 01:13:15.132
Why didn't he?

975
01:13:15.585 --> 01:13:17.736
Looking after dogs is just
as good of a profession


976
01:13:17.748 --> 01:13:19.826
as any other while I
continue the home invasions.


977
01:13:20.406 --> 01:13:20.906
I stopped.

978
01:13:23.086 --> 01:13:23.746
A few months ago.

979
01:13:24.747 --> 01:13:25.587
What made you do that?

980
01:13:26.547 --> 01:13:27.487
A chance encounter.

981
01:13:29.587 --> 01:13:29.987
Miss you.

982
01:13:30.488 --> 01:13:30.828
Ackerman.

983
01:13:31.168 --> 01:13:31.608
Insurance.

984
01:13:32.208 --> 01:13:32.688
Right this way.

985
01:13:36.809 --> 01:13:37.109
Sir.

986
01:13:38.269 --> 01:13:38.749
Morning, ma'am.

987
01:13:39.269 --> 01:13:39.629
Ackerman.

988
01:13:40.229 --> 01:13:41.969
I'll be your claims adjuster for today.

989
01:13:42.650 --> 01:13:43.790
Thank you for agreeing to see me.

990
01:13:44.030 --> 01:13:44.890
Please take a seat.

991
01:13:45.858 --> 01:13:46.118
OK.

992
01:13:52.585 --> 01:13:53.446
So what do you want to know?

993
01:13:55.568 --> 01:13:58.111
Just, you know, tell me
the whole story, I guess.


994
01:13:59.532 --> 01:14:03.760
Well, we came back
from the United Nations


995
01:14:03.772 --> 01:14:07.421
gala around 1
o'clock in the morning.


996
01:14:08.042 --> 01:14:11.905
I took off my necklace, put it
on the dresser, as I always do.


997
01:14:12.685 --> 01:14:14.527
Oh, not in the safe?

998
01:14:14.887 --> 01:14:17.569
Because I do believe
that you have a safe, right?


999
01:14:18.670 --> 01:14:20.971
No, I was far too tired
to come back down here.


1000
01:14:22.853 --> 01:14:23.113
I see.

1001
01:14:24.414 --> 01:14:25.294
And the staff?

1002
01:14:25.354 --> 01:14:26.095
What about the staff?

1003
01:14:26.135 --> 01:14:26.755
Have they all left?

1004
01:14:27.016 --> 01:14:27.716
Oh, long gone.

1005
01:14:28.597 --> 01:14:30.078
I locked the front door myself.

1006
01:14:33.080 --> 01:14:35.862
The dogs, you didn't hear
the dogs bark last night?


1007
01:14:36.422 --> 01:14:37.123
No, not at all.

1008
01:14:38.812 --> 01:14:40.073
I'm a very light sleeper, too.

1009
01:14:40.113 --> 01:14:40.873
I would have heard them.

1010
01:14:41.653 --> 01:14:42.573
Was the window open?

1011
01:14:43.314 --> 01:14:44.974
All the windows are tight shut.

1012
01:14:45.915 --> 01:14:47.680
Well, except for one
in the bathroom, but


1013
01:14:47.692 --> 01:14:49.596
it's far too small for
anyone to get through.


1014
01:14:49.976 --> 01:14:50.216
Hmm.

1015
01:14:50.516 --> 01:14:50.816
I see.

1016
01:14:51.316 --> 01:14:53.997
And, uh, what time did you
realize the necklace was missing?


1017
01:14:55.078 --> 01:14:57.178
When I woke up at 7
o'clock the next morning.


1018
01:14:58.259 --> 01:15:00.460
So... Okay, so let me get this straight.

1019
01:15:00.480 --> 01:15:03.379
So the jewelry vanished
sometime between the hours of 1


1020
01:15:03.391 --> 01:15:06.302
and 7 in the morning from a
locked house with you in it?


1021
01:15:06.882 --> 01:15:07.382
Exactly.

1022
01:15:10.719 --> 01:15:14.165
Now, if you think that I'm making
this whole story up to cash in for


1023
01:15:14.177 --> 01:15:17.585
the insurance... Well, far be it for
me to suggest otherwise, ma'am.


1024
01:15:17.625 --> 01:15:21.458
Your reputation speaks for
itself, but you have to admit


1025
01:15:21.470 --> 01:15:24.911
it's a, you know, it's a
tricky equation to square.


1026
01:15:25.692 --> 01:15:26.753
Well, isn't that why you're here?

1027
01:15:28.554 --> 01:15:29.095
Yes, indeed.

1028
01:15:32.978 --> 01:15:35.540
As requested, the footage
from the security cameras.


1029
01:15:36.561 --> 01:15:38.803
There are 12 cameras
all around this house.


1030
01:15:40.690 --> 01:15:41.290
None inside?

1031
01:15:41.970 --> 01:15:42.150
No.

1032
01:15:43.031 --> 01:15:44.471
We appreciate our privacy.

1033
01:15:49.112 --> 01:15:49.332
Ma'am.

1034
01:15:57.474 --> 01:16:00.855
Que reste-t-il de nos amours?

1035
01:16:00.935 --> 01:16:03.816
Que reste-t-il de ces beaux jours?

1036
01:16:03.896 --> 01:16:05.716
Une photo, vieille photo,

1037
01:16:10.497 --> 01:16:15.470
De ma jeunesse Que reste-t-il
Des billets doux Des mois d'avril Des


1038
01:16:15.482 --> 01:16:20.906
rendez-vous sans fin Le poursuit sans
cesse Honneur affané Cheveux au vent


1039
01:16:35.515 --> 01:16:40.837
1.04 a.m.

1040
01:16:40.877 --> 01:16:45.359
A woman arrives home, and nothing till

1041
01:16:49.141 --> 01:16:49.561
Whoa, whoa.

1042
01:16:50.462 --> 01:16:51.242
Back it up a fraction.

1043
01:16:53.703 --> 01:16:54.063
Back it up.

1044
01:16:57.285 --> 01:16:57.865
What are they doing?

1045
01:16:58.205 --> 01:16:59.526
Looks like they're greeting someone.

1046
01:17:00.787 --> 01:17:01.187
What's that?

1047
01:17:02.189 --> 01:17:04.768
Yeah, a stray dog enters
the property, they play


1048
01:17:04.780 --> 01:17:07.212
for about five minutes,
and then it takes off.


1049
01:17:11.194 --> 01:17:11.615
Go forward.

1050
01:17:18.058 --> 01:17:18.739
Go frame by frame.

1051
01:17:21.901 --> 01:17:22.961
Forward, forward.

1052
01:17:24.822 --> 01:17:25.123
Right there.

1053
01:17:26.143 --> 01:17:26.864
There, the dog.

1054
01:17:27.364 --> 01:17:28.224
See, it's got the necklace.

1055
01:17:28.404 --> 01:17:29.225
The dog's got the necklace.

1056
01:17:30.230 --> 01:17:31.131
It's hard to say for sure.

1057
01:17:31.551 --> 01:17:32.471
Could be its ID tag.

1058
01:17:33.692 --> 01:17:37.154
You get the tapes from last month,
the burglary on Virginia Street?


1059
01:17:38.855 --> 01:17:39.255
Uh, yeah.

1060
01:17:40.315 --> 01:17:40.535
Yeah.

1061
01:17:42.476 --> 01:17:43.457
Why don't you go get him, Jerry?

1062
01:18:08.478 --> 01:18:08.638
There.

1063
01:18:09.479 --> 01:18:09.719
Go back.

1064
01:18:10.079 --> 01:18:10.559
Back, back, back, back.

1065
01:18:12.440 --> 01:18:12.580
See?

1066
01:18:12.820 --> 01:18:13.421
What did I tell you?

1067
01:18:13.801 --> 01:18:14.441
There's another dog.

1068
01:18:14.942 --> 01:18:15.722
There's a dog right there.

1069
01:18:16.142 --> 01:18:17.223
It's tough to call, sir.

1070
01:18:17.283 --> 01:18:18.043
Could be a fox.

1071
01:18:18.203 --> 01:18:20.064
They have a chicken run in the backyard.

1072
01:18:20.244 --> 01:18:21.205
Oh, is that what you think, Jerry?

1073
01:18:21.785 --> 01:18:23.846
Why don't you go get the
tapes related to similar cases?


1074
01:18:25.928 --> 01:18:26.308
Now, Jerry.

1075
01:18:26.548 --> 01:18:26.668
Yeah.

1076
01:18:40.662 --> 01:18:41.903
Right there.

1077
01:18:42.203 --> 01:18:43.864
See right there?

1078
01:18:43.884 --> 01:18:44.284
See that?

1079
01:18:44.885 --> 01:18:46.786
Keep going.

1080
01:18:46.806 --> 01:18:52.830
Keep trying.

1081
01:18:52.890 --> 01:18:54.151
There.

1082
01:18:54.311 --> 01:18:54.871
Oh, shit.

1083
01:18:56.472 --> 01:18:56.753
See?

1084
01:18:58.694 --> 01:18:58.834
Aha!

1085
01:18:59.694 --> 01:19:03.377
This, my friend, this
is the work of an artist.


1086
01:19:24.860 --> 01:19:31.689
Outside the barracks, by the
corner light I'll always stand


1087
01:19:31.701 --> 01:19:38.086
and wait for you at night
We will create a world for two


1088
01:19:39.021 --> 01:19:43.162
I'll wait for you the
whole night through.


1089
01:19:43.763 --> 01:19:46.824
For you, Lily Marley.

1090
01:19:48.184 --> 01:19:51.825
For you, Lily Marley.

1091
01:19:53.566 --> 01:19:57.527
Bugler tonight, don't
play the call to watch.


1092
01:19:58.607 --> 01:20:02.248
I want another evening with a chance.

1093
01:20:02.969 --> 01:20:06.730
Then we will say goodbye and pass.

1094
01:20:07.682 --> 01:20:11.463
I'll always keep you in my heart.

1095
01:20:12.243 --> 01:20:15.283
With me, Lily Marley.

1096
01:20:16.704 --> 01:20:20.324
With me, Lily Marley.

1097
01:20:21.285 --> 01:20:26.166
Give me a rose to show
how much you care.


1098
01:20:26.906 --> 01:20:30.986
Tie to the stem
a lock of golden hair.

1099
01:20:31.707 --> 01:20:33.407
Surely tomorrow

1100
01:20:34.206 --> 01:20:40.388
You'll feel blue, but then
will come a love that's new.


1101
01:20:41.188 --> 01:20:44.249
For you, Lily Marley.

1102
01:20:45.430 --> 01:20:48.751
For you, Lily Marley.

1103
01:21:14.055 --> 01:21:21.380
It's you, Lily Marley.

1104
01:21:26.384 --> 01:21:27.164
You were so good.

1105
01:21:27.284 --> 01:21:28.125
It was so good.

1106
01:21:28.165 --> 01:21:29.105
You looked fantastic.

1107
01:21:29.125 --> 01:21:29.866
You looked beautiful.

1108
01:21:29.906 --> 01:21:31.087
I am so proud of you.

1109
01:21:31.167 --> 01:21:32.307
Girls, are you decent?

1110
01:21:32.467 --> 01:21:32.968
Good.

1111
01:21:33.488 --> 01:21:36.110
Marlena, darling, you
have a gentleman caller.


1112
01:21:37.132 --> 01:21:37.893
She's got fans now.

1113
01:21:37.913 --> 01:21:38.253
Hello.

1114
01:21:40.715 --> 01:21:40.895
Hi.

1115
01:21:41.136 --> 01:21:41.396
Sorry.

1116
01:21:41.916 --> 01:21:43.177
I just wanted to congratulate you.

1117
01:21:43.858 --> 01:21:44.098
Wow.

1118
01:21:44.339 --> 01:21:44.979
That was awesome.

1119
01:21:45.780 --> 01:21:46.440
I'm a total fan.

1120
01:21:47.481 --> 01:21:47.842
Thank you.

1121
01:21:48.362 --> 01:21:49.443
Yeah.

1122
01:21:50.324 --> 01:21:50.564
May I?

1123
01:21:50.644 --> 01:21:50.884
Sorry.

1124
01:21:51.705 --> 01:21:51.985
May I?

1125
01:21:55.348 --> 01:21:56.510
Yeah.

1126
01:21:56.590 --> 01:21:59.953
My mother's family came from Germany,
so I know all those songs by heart.


1127
01:22:00.233 --> 01:22:03.516
And believe me when I say
you gave a magnificent rendition.


1128
01:22:06.381 --> 01:22:09.982
Well, coming from a specialist, I
appreciate the compliment even more.


1129
01:22:11.902 --> 01:22:12.542
Perform every night?

1130
01:22:13.823 --> 01:22:14.583
No, once a week.

1131
01:22:14.963 --> 01:22:15.583
Oh, good call.

1132
01:22:16.143 --> 01:22:18.564
Yeah, you know, the rarer
something is, the greater its value.


1133
01:22:20.204 --> 01:22:20.644
It's true.

1134
01:22:23.285 --> 01:22:23.625
Which night?

1135
01:22:25.206 --> 01:22:25.526
Friday.

1136
01:22:26.106 --> 01:22:27.406
Now you know where to
find me every Friday night.


1137
01:22:31.587 --> 01:22:35.068
Look, I know this is
rather, uh, bold, but...


1138
01:22:36.484 --> 01:22:38.345
May I invite you to dinner with me?

1139
01:22:39.246 --> 01:22:41.788
I'm just dying to get to know you.

1140
01:22:42.308 --> 01:22:44.310
You already know the
best part of me, darling.


1141
01:22:44.350 --> 01:22:46.171
The rest isn't worth
wasting your time on.


1142
01:22:46.771 --> 01:22:50.034
Ah, you are much too
modest, like all true artistes.


1143
01:22:52.976 --> 01:22:54.592
I don't know what
you do for a living,


1144
01:22:54.604 --> 01:22:56.398
sir, but you'd make
one hell of a salesman.


1145
01:22:57.519 --> 01:22:58.360
I work in insurance.

1146
01:23:03.187 --> 01:23:03.867
That makes sense.

1147
01:23:03.907 --> 01:23:04.547
They're the worst.

1148
01:23:06.248 --> 01:23:07.029
When you're right, you're right.

1149
01:23:07.309 --> 01:23:08.210
You are so right.

1150
01:23:08.850 --> 01:23:12.172
But, you know, under
the suit, there's a man.


1151
01:23:12.812 --> 01:23:13.733
A man worth getting to know.

1152
01:23:14.053 --> 01:23:14.493
I'm sure.

1153
01:23:14.874 --> 01:23:16.755
Or worth getting dinner with, at least.

1154
01:23:17.555 --> 01:23:17.835
Come on.

1155
01:23:18.796 --> 01:23:19.296
Have dinner with me.

1156
01:23:19.837 --> 01:23:20.697
I know you want
to have dinner with me.

1157
01:23:21.658 --> 01:23:22.838
That's very sweet of you.

1158
01:23:23.759 --> 01:23:25.620
And I appreciate the offer.

1159
01:23:26.621 --> 01:23:27.561
But I need to get home.

1160
01:23:28.042 --> 01:23:29.182
I have my children to feed.

1161
01:23:29.342 --> 01:23:30.143
I hope you understand.

1162
01:23:32.357 --> 01:23:34.979
Well, apologies if I
came on a little strong.


1163
01:23:35.419 --> 01:23:36.080
No, not at all.

1164
01:23:36.680 --> 01:23:38.642
But I will see you next Friday?

1165
01:23:39.702 --> 01:23:40.243
With pleasure.

1166
01:23:41.223 --> 01:23:41.524
Yeah.

1167
01:23:42.584 --> 01:23:42.785
Whoa.

1168
01:23:43.225 --> 01:23:47.008
It's just, you just, you made my night.

1169
01:23:52.592 --> 01:23:53.112
What was that?

1170
01:23:56.274 --> 01:23:57.195
Oh, my God.

1171
01:23:57.455 --> 01:23:57.915
Is it real?

1172
01:23:57.935 --> 01:23:57.995
Yes.

1173
01:24:01.518 --> 01:24:02.799
How often does that happen to you?

1174
01:24:03.960 --> 01:24:06.261
Well, quite often.

1175
01:24:16.768 --> 01:24:18.288
You sure you got the right address?

1176
01:24:18.429 --> 01:24:19.429
It's just a shortcut.

1177
01:24:20.330 --> 01:24:21.510
I just need a little fresh air.

1178
01:24:21.971 --> 01:24:23.692
Think you could help
me with my chair, please?


1179
01:24:24.212 --> 01:24:24.512
Sure.

1180
01:24:25.193 --> 01:24:25.513
Thank you.

1181
01:25:53.233 --> 01:26:03.233
Hey, what's up?

1182
01:26:05.559 --> 01:26:14.343
Okay, good luck.

1183
01:26:18.165 --> 01:26:19.426
Kids, get ready.

1184
01:26:19.486 --> 01:26:20.086
We have company.

1185
01:26:41.640 --> 01:26:43.561
Well, I admire your persistence, sir.

1186
01:26:43.621 --> 01:26:45.662
This is verging on harassment.

1187
01:26:46.042 --> 01:26:46.863
I could sue for this.

1188
01:26:46.943 --> 01:26:47.843
Oh, be my guest, pal.

1189
01:26:47.903 --> 01:26:50.344
I'll tell the court about your dogs
that you trained to steal from houses.


1190
01:26:50.484 --> 01:26:52.625
My dogs are as free as
the air you breathe, sir.


1191
01:26:52.785 --> 01:26:55.106
They've received no particular
training from me, I assure you.


1192
01:26:56.107 --> 01:26:58.438
I have several dozen videos
that prove the opposite,


1193
01:26:58.450 --> 01:27:00.749
and some of the protagonists
live in this very room.


1194
01:27:01.029 --> 01:27:03.605
I also have a list of all the
valuables that were stolen,


1195
01:27:03.617 --> 01:27:06.472
jewelry mostly, which you have
no hesitation flaunting on stage.


1196
01:27:06.752 --> 01:27:08.093
That's cute, but I don't steal.

1197
01:27:08.173 --> 01:27:10.053
I contribute to the
redistribution of wealth.


1198
01:27:10.093 --> 01:27:11.014
Very different things.

1199
01:27:11.194 --> 01:27:12.815
Fine by me, but let's
redistribute it differently.


1200
01:27:13.295 --> 01:27:13.476
Okay?

1201
01:27:13.716 --> 01:27:14.136
If you don't mind.

1202
01:27:16.938 --> 01:27:18.299
Oh, so it's all about money.

1203
01:27:18.939 --> 01:27:19.560
Uh, yes!

1204
01:27:20.600 --> 01:27:21.421
It's all about money!

1205
01:27:22.481 --> 01:27:23.882
Money, money, money.

1206
01:27:24.743 --> 01:27:27.599
Always sunny in
the... Honey, whatever


1207
01:27:27.611 --> 01:27:30.627
the fuck you are, the
show is over, okay?


1208
01:27:30.747 --> 01:27:32.059
You're gonna hand
over the rocks that you


1209
01:27:32.071 --> 01:27:33.489
must have stashed
somewhere in all this mess.


1210
01:27:33.729 --> 01:27:36.451
Do not try telling me that they're in a
bank, because you have zero accounts.


1211
01:27:36.631 --> 01:27:36.911
I checked.

1212
01:27:38.212 --> 01:27:38.292
Hmm?

1213
01:27:39.928 --> 01:27:40.829
Don't fuck with me.

1214
01:27:40.889 --> 01:27:42.210
Give me the fucking rocks.

1215
01:27:43.110 --> 01:27:44.825
I really do not want
to shoot a handicapped


1216
01:27:44.837 --> 01:27:46.132
person today,
but I fucking will.


1217
01:27:48.574 --> 01:27:48.974
70, 80, 70.

1218
01:27:49.034 --> 01:27:51.035
70, 80, what is that?

1219
01:27:51.056 --> 01:27:52.036
What are these numbers?

1220
01:27:52.316 --> 01:27:54.435
It's my vital statistics
and the combination


1221
01:27:54.447 --> 01:27:56.199
to the safe over
there in the closet.


1222
01:28:19.598 --> 01:28:20.178
Oh, fuck yes.

1223
01:28:20.838 --> 01:28:23.839
Now that you're a rich man, I'd be
happy to accept your dinner invitation.


1224
01:28:27.781 --> 01:28:28.281
Take a seat.

1225
01:28:28.321 --> 01:28:29.501
Dinner will be ready in two minutes.

1226
01:28:34.302 --> 01:28:36.003
You want to have dinner with me?

1227
01:28:37.183 --> 01:28:37.543
Sure.

1228
01:28:38.964 --> 01:28:39.584
Why wouldn't I?

1229
01:28:41.425 --> 01:28:45.646
I mean, to be completely honest,
it's not very often that I get visitors.


1230
01:28:46.814 --> 01:28:50.042
Besides, money has never been
what drives me, and all those necklaces


1231
01:28:50.054 --> 01:28:53.017
would definitely get more use
around the necks of pretty ladies.


1232
01:29:00.600 --> 01:29:01.140
You're insane.

1233
01:29:04.141 --> 01:29:04.581
Thank you.

1234
01:29:06.462 --> 01:29:06.962
Take a seat.

1235
01:29:12.925 --> 01:29:14.045
Do you like chili?

1236
01:29:15.165 --> 01:29:16.386
Well, you know, it depends.

1237
01:29:17.974 --> 01:29:21.058
My mother used to
make it all the time.

1238
01:29:23.100 --> 01:29:24.461
I used to love watching her cook.

1239
01:29:26.944 --> 01:29:29.888
To be honest, I'm so
hungry I could eat a horse.


1240
01:29:31.750 --> 01:29:32.230
That's lucky.

1241
01:29:32.270 --> 01:29:32.631
It's ready.

1242
01:30:02.519 --> 01:30:04.280
You are aware that we're talking

1243
01:30:04.292 --> 01:30:06.620
about a serious
criminal act here, right?


1244
01:30:07.000 --> 01:30:08.040
Dog eat dog.

1245
01:30:08.680 --> 01:30:10.701
It's just a simple
law of nature, isn't it?


1246
01:30:10.881 --> 01:30:13.796
You know, my profession
demands the strictest


1247
01:30:13.808 --> 01:30:16.862
confidentiality with
regards to our discussions.


1248
01:30:18.003 --> 01:30:22.964
Should I, however, be witness even
indirectly to a criminal act that resulted


1249
01:30:22.976 --> 01:30:27.885
in a death, I am legally obligated to
report any information that I may have.


1250
01:30:28.520 --> 01:30:29.561
I'll plead self-defense.

1251
01:30:30.061 --> 01:30:31.582
You risk the death penalty.

1252
01:30:31.682 --> 01:30:32.483
You realize that?

1253
01:30:33.503 --> 01:30:35.685
I've already died several times.

1254
01:30:36.145 --> 01:30:37.246
This one could be the last.

1255
01:30:39.708 --> 01:30:40.909
Well, if it's God's will.

1256
01:30:41.729 --> 01:30:44.131
At the end of the day, I'm just a
puppet at the end of his strings.


1257
01:30:44.291 --> 01:30:45.111
No, you're not.

1258
01:30:46.279 --> 01:30:48.017
Things happen in life
true, and most of the


1259
01:30:48.029 --> 01:30:49.700
time, there's nothing
you can do about it.


1260
01:30:50.441 --> 01:30:52.661
Ultimately, it's our reaction
that matters the most.


1261
01:30:52.681 --> 01:30:54.222
I mean, you can be sad.

1262
01:30:54.282 --> 01:30:55.122
You can be desperate.

1263
01:30:55.903 --> 01:30:57.663
You could fight or you
could laugh about it.


1264
01:30:58.324 --> 01:30:59.204
It's really up to you.

1265
01:30:59.284 --> 01:31:00.824
It's your decision.

1266
01:31:00.864 --> 01:31:01.505
No one else's.

1267
01:31:02.245 --> 01:31:03.245
It's called free will.

1268
01:31:04.326 --> 01:31:05.106
God invented it.

1269
01:31:07.707 --> 01:31:10.208
How often did this type
of situation happen?


1270
01:31:11.769 --> 01:31:12.909
Which kind of situation?

1271
01:31:13.209 --> 01:31:13.929
Killing a man.

1272
01:31:14.770 --> 01:31:14.870
Oh.

1273
01:31:17.076 --> 01:31:20.277
No, not until yesterday.

1274
01:31:21.697 --> 01:31:22.577
What happened yesterday?

1275
01:31:24.317 --> 01:31:26.498
God sent his angels of the apocalypse.

1276
01:31:39.440 --> 01:31:42.940
I want to be
loved by you, just you.

1277
01:31:43.541 --> 01:31:45.601
Nobody else but you.

1278
01:31:47.020 --> 01:31:51.505
I wanna be loved by you alone.

1279
01:31:51.525 --> 01:31:58.992
I wanna be kissed by you just you.

1280
01:31:59.012 --> 01:32:00.914
Nobody else but you.

1281
01:32:00.934 --> 01:32:05.879
I wanna be kissed by you alone.

1282
01:32:09.815 --> 01:32:09.995
No!

1283
01:32:10.235 --> 01:32:10.516
Please!

1284
01:32:10.536 --> 01:32:10.756
Please!

1285
01:32:10.776 --> 01:32:10.916
Please!

1286
01:32:10.936 --> 01:32:11.196
Please!

1287
01:32:32.410 --> 01:32:35.972
I wanna be loved by you alone.

1288
01:32:36.972 --> 01:32:38.433
Are you sure he lives here?

1289
01:32:38.453 --> 01:32:40.334
Yes, yes, yes, 
I swear to God.

1290
01:32:40.594 --> 01:32:46.256
There's a red cat there
at the end of the hallway.


1291
01:32:46.276 --> 01:32:49.377
There's dogs.

1292
01:32:49.677 --> 01:32:53.719
Okay, I believe you.

1293
01:32:56.780 --> 01:32:58.101
Now, find me this motherfucker.

1294
01:32:58.121 --> 01:32:59.342
Come on, let's go.

1295
01:33:06.979 --> 01:33:08.040
Time for war, everyone.

1296
01:33:53.445 --> 01:33:54.487
What's up?

1297
01:33:55.400 --> 01:33:56.120
The fucking door.

1298
01:33:56.621 --> 01:33:57.561
Go check, go check.

1299
01:34:09.427 --> 01:34:10.347
Mierda.

1300
01:34:10.407 --> 01:34:11.988
Go around, go around.

1301
01:34:17.570 --> 01:34:18.403
Damn!

1302
01:34:29.850 --> 01:34:30.935
Okay, yo por aqui.

1303
01:34:31.196 --> 01:34:31.778
Tu por alla.

1304
01:34:32.060 --> 01:34:32.602
Okay, okay.

1305
01:34:32.763 --> 01:34:33.426
Vamos.

1306
01:35:03.835 --> 01:35:04.296
This is it.

1307
01:35:37.734 --> 01:35:37.775
Oh.

1308
01:36:16.112 --> 01:36:17.612
Damn! Are you okay?

1309
01:36:16.930 --> 01:36:17.391
Are you okay?

1310
01:36:18.333 --> 01:36:18.593
Rico!

1311
01:36:54.676 --> 01:36:55.402
Bring in the artillery.

1312
01:37:41.304 --> 01:37:41.921
Ah, shit.

1313
01:39:17.684 --> 01:39:18.325
It's over, kid.

1314
01:39:19.105 --> 01:39:19.806
We had a deal.

1315
01:39:21.087 --> 01:39:22.308
I thought we had a deal!

1316
01:39:23.249 --> 01:39:25.532
But as we've known
for so long, these are just


1317
01:39:25.544 --> 01:39:27.693
sentiments that lead
to a person's downfall.


1318
01:39:28.473 --> 01:39:29.114
You're the devil.

1319
01:39:29.914 --> 01:39:31.095
I'm sending you back to hell.

1320
01:39:34.478 --> 01:39:36.560
If it's God's will.

1321
01:39:47.602 --> 01:39:49.583
I guess God is
not on your side today.

1322
01:39:51.164 --> 01:39:51.584
Cheers.

1323
01:40:32.123 --> 01:40:32.623
Thank you.

1324
01:40:34.584 --> 01:40:35.524
That's a cute lighter.

1325
01:40:37.685 --> 01:40:39.125
Will I keep it?

1326
01:40:39.145 --> 01:40:39.526
Sure.

1327
01:40:42.066 --> 01:40:42.827
Thank you.

1328
01:40:42.927 --> 01:40:45.567
It's ridiculous.

1329
01:40:53.412 --> 01:40:54.292
Are all those dogs yours?

1330
01:40:56.453 --> 01:40:57.474
Yes, they're my babies.

1331
01:40:57.494 --> 01:41:02.596
I don't know what they're
going to do with them.


1332
01:41:05.037 --> 01:41:05.537
Don't worry.

1333
01:41:05.557 --> 01:41:06.857
They know exactly what to do.

1334
01:41:28.301 --> 01:41:30.182
I think I've asked enough
questions for today.


1335
01:41:31.183 --> 01:41:34.675
I'm gonna take some
time and process all of this


1336
01:41:34.687 --> 01:41:38.048
and figure out how I
can... how I can help you.


1337
01:41:40.889 --> 01:41:42.130
That's very sweet of you.

1338
01:41:44.212 --> 01:41:46.513
And you've already
helped me a lot, actually.


1339
01:41:47.414 --> 01:41:47.934
You're right.

1340
01:41:48.955 --> 01:41:51.176
I need to make
a decision about my life.

1341
01:41:53.358 --> 01:41:54.983
Perhaps I have
to pay the ultimate


1342
01:41:54.995 --> 01:41:56.960
price to earn the
right to be by his side.


1343
01:41:59.763 --> 01:42:00.524
Today is Sunday.

1344
01:42:01.384 --> 01:42:02.325
It's the Lord's day.

1345
01:42:04.147 --> 01:42:05.948
The right day to ask him this question.

1346
01:42:12.674 --> 01:42:13.414
Thank you, Doctor.

1347
01:42:14.836 --> 01:42:15.176
Evelyn.

1348
01:42:17.858 --> 01:42:18.719
Thank you, Evelyn.

1349
01:42:35.337 --> 01:42:36.478
Can I ask you one more question?

1350
01:42:38.239 --> 01:42:38.520
Sure.

1351
01:42:39.640 --> 01:42:40.761
What made you open up to me?

1352
01:42:43.484 --> 01:42:45.045
We both have something in common.

1353
01:42:46.606 --> 01:42:47.347
Yeah, what's that?

1354
01:42:49.929 --> 01:42:50.149
Pain.

1355
01:43:39.526 --> 01:43:40.127
Are you done?

1356
01:43:43.895 --> 01:43:44.276
Yes.

1357
01:43:46.280 --> 01:43:46.741
I'm done.

1358
01:44:20.179 --> 01:44:20.499
No, no, no.

1359
01:45:02.944 --> 01:45:03.775
Go, go, go!

1360
01:45:59.693 --> 01:46:00.325
Hey, guys.

1361
01:46:51.686 --> 01:47:01.686
Non, rien de rien Non,
je ne regrette rien Ni le


1362
01:47:02.567 --> 01:47:12.567
bien qu'on m'a fait Ni le
mal où ça m'est bien aidé


1363
01:47:21.365 --> 01:47:31.365
No, je ne regrette rien
C'est payé, balayé, oublié Je


1364
01:47:33.772 --> 01:47:43.772
me fous du passé Avec mes
souvenirs J'ai allumé le feu


1365
01:47:47.582 --> 01:47:48.483
Here I am.

1366
01:47:48.503 --> 01:47:49.745
For you.

1367
01:47:49.765 --> 01:47:51.366
I am standing for you.

1368
01:47:51.386 --> 01:47:53.709
I am standing for you!

1369
01:48:15.674 --> 01:48:16.195
I'm ready.

1370
01:48:16.275 --> 01:48:16.695
I'm ready.

1371
01:48:51.184 --> 01:48:53.006
Ça commence avec toi

1372
01:49:33.543 --> 01:49:41.312
star hoping for more her own

1373
01:51:21.521 --> 01:51:23.391
Let's go to the slide.

1374
01:51:55.592 --> 01:52:05.592
star all by herself she is
hoping for more her own


1375
01:52:08.969 --> 01:52:18.969
arms wrapped around her
let us roll effortlessly in a


1376
01:52:50.878 --> 01:52:51.278
you you

1377
01:53:34.342 --> 01:53:34.522
you
