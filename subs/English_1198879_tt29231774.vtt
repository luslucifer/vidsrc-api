00:00:07.233 --> 00:00:08.693
[electric razor buzzing]

2
00:00:08.777 --> 00:00:10.153
[upbeat jazz music playing]

3
00:00:15.533 --> 00:00:18.369
[scattered cheering]

4
00:00:22.082 --> 00:00:24.918
[crowd cheering]

5
00:00:25.001 --> 00:00:26.836
[upbeat jazz music continues]

6
00:00:35.136 --> 00:00:36.137
Hello, hello.

7
00:00:39.307 --> 00:00:40.892
Sit down, sit down, sit down.

8
00:00:42.727 --> 00:00:43.686
What's up?

9
00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:44.979
[audience laughing]

10
00:00:45.063 --> 00:00:48.650
Hell yeah. It's cool to be here.
I appreciate, like, that introduction,


11
00:00:48.733 --> 00:00:51.111
but I'm not high-energy like that, though.

12
00:00:51.194 --> 00:00:52.904
[audience laughing]

13
00:00:52.987 --> 00:00:54.364
I'm very low-energy.

14
00:00:54.447 --> 00:00:56.449
I'm trying to get lower, even.

15
00:00:56.533 --> 00:00:57.909
[audience laughing]

16
00:00:57.992 --> 00:00:59.702
I've been trying to chill lately.

17
00:00:59.786 --> 00:01:01.746
I've been drinking less, yeah.

18
00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:04.958
But... like if I'm with a group of people
that take me to a bar,


19
00:01:05.041 --> 00:01:07.293
then I'll drink, you know. You have to.

20
00:01:07.377 --> 00:01:10.839
You can't be that one person at the bar
without a drink in their hand.


21
00:01:10.922 --> 00:01:12.006
That's weird.

22
00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.759
That's like being the one dude
at a kids' soccer game,


23
00:01:14.843 --> 00:01:16.344
and you don't even have a kid.

24
00:01:16.427 --> 00:01:18.429
[audience laughing]

25
00:01:19.389 --> 00:01:20.849
People will stare at you.

26
00:01:20.932 --> 00:01:23.393
They're like, "What do you mean
you just like to be here?"


27
00:01:23.476 --> 00:01:25.436
[audience laughing]

28
00:01:26.813 --> 00:01:28.648
One of my buddies, he quit drinking.

29
00:01:28.731 --> 00:01:30.733
He says his therapist cured him.

30
00:01:31.943 --> 00:01:34.487
He's like, "No, man.
She opened my eyes up to something."


31
00:01:35.321 --> 00:01:39.617
He's like, "If you think about it,
we probably don't even like alcohol."


32
00:01:40.535 --> 00:01:42.036
I was like, "Nah, I like it."

33
00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:43.288
[audience laughing]

34
00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:47.292
He's like, "Nah, man,
my therapist put it like this."


35
00:01:47.375 --> 00:01:51.254
Like, "We probably just drink because
of the patterns our fathers set for us,


36
00:01:51.337 --> 00:01:53.548
like how we saw them drinking growing up."

37
00:01:54.174 --> 00:01:56.885
I said, "Bro, I saw that man,
like, twice growing up."


38
00:01:56.968 --> 00:01:58.970
[audience laughing]

39
00:02:00.096 --> 00:02:01.472
"He was sober both times."

40
00:02:01.556 --> 00:02:03.558
[audience laughing]

41
00:02:06.769 --> 00:02:09.647
But I, like, halfway agree
with that little school of thought.


42
00:02:09.731 --> 00:02:14.068
Like, I don't think childhood trauma
makes you turn to alcohol,


43
00:02:14.152 --> 00:02:18.323
but I do think childhood trauma
can make alcohol taste better.


44
00:02:18.406 --> 00:02:20.408
[audience laughing]

45
00:02:21.201 --> 00:02:22.493
Like as a kid,

46
00:02:22.577 --> 00:02:25.371
any time you scored a touchdown
at one of your Little League games


47
00:02:25.455 --> 00:02:27.457
and your dad wasn't there to see it,

48
00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:30.210
your taste buds probably shifted
just a little bit.


49
00:02:30.293 --> 00:02:31.753
[audience laughing]

50
00:02:32.462 --> 00:02:35.673
And with every first down,
they just kept shifting and shifting.


51
00:02:36.507 --> 00:02:39.385
That's why whenever I see somebody
take a shot of whiskey


52
00:02:39.469 --> 00:02:42.847
without making a face, I'm like,
"Damn. He didn't even have no dad."


53
00:02:42.931 --> 00:02:45.767
[audience laughing]

54
00:02:49.646 --> 00:02:53.107
I'm trying to drink less. Trying to take
better care of my health, you know?


55
00:02:53.191 --> 00:02:56.319
I was even smoking cigarettes
for a little bit. I stopped that.


56
00:02:56.402 --> 00:02:57.570
I know it's unhealthy,

57
00:02:57.654 --> 00:03:00.406
but I started 'cause
I saw somebody smoking and talking,


58
00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:02.200
and they look so cool, you know?

59
00:03:02.742 --> 00:03:04.619
You ever see somebody smoke and talk?

60
00:03:04.702 --> 00:03:06.704
Whatever they're saying,
you just go with it.


61
00:03:07.664 --> 00:03:10.667
They don't even have to say real words.
They just gotta, like...


62
00:03:11.751 --> 00:03:13.753
[audience laughing]

63
00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:19.175
I'm like, "Bro, he's so right."

64
00:03:19.259 --> 00:03:21.261
[audience laughing]

65
00:03:24.806 --> 00:03:28.017
Yeah, I know... I know it's unhealthy,
but all those health risks,


66
00:03:28.101 --> 00:03:29.811
and the warnings they give you,

67
00:03:29.894 --> 00:03:32.855
that's what pushed me over the edge
to try them in the first place.


68
00:03:33.564 --> 00:03:35.942
I was reading that little box
of cigarettes.


69
00:03:36.025 --> 00:03:37.485
It was like, "Warning...

70
00:03:37.568 --> 00:03:41.531
tobacco may increase the risk
of infertility, low birth weight,"


71
00:03:41.614 --> 00:03:43.074
and so on and so on.

72
00:03:43.157 --> 00:03:46.119
But the beginning is what got me.
I was like, "Infertility..."


73
00:03:46.202 --> 00:03:47.954
[audience laughing]

74
00:03:48.037 --> 00:03:50.540
In my mind, I'm like,
"Damn, so I look cool as hell


75
00:03:50.623 --> 00:03:52.709
<i>and</i> I don't have to use condoms anymore?"

76
00:03:52.792 --> 00:03:54.794
[audience laughing]

77
00:03:55.795 --> 00:03:59.382
I'll be about to hook up with a girl,
and she's like, "Do you have protection?"


78
00:03:59.465 --> 00:04:00.758
I'm like... [inhales]

79
00:04:00.842 --> 00:04:03.177
[audience laughing]

80
00:04:03.261 --> 00:04:04.554
"Just hit this, baby."

81
00:04:04.637 --> 00:04:06.931
[audience laughing]

82
00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:11.853
First time I tried it, I only...

83
00:04:11.936 --> 00:04:15.148
I only tried it 'cause I wanted to do,
like, the flicky thing.


84
00:04:15.231 --> 00:04:16.607
[audience laughing]

85
00:04:16.691 --> 00:04:18.401
That's the coolest part about it.

86
00:04:19.235 --> 00:04:22.280
I was outside the bar,
and I feel... I feel like I nailed it.


87
00:04:22.363 --> 00:04:25.450
I put that cigarette in my mouth,
I lit it, I took that first hit,


88
00:04:25.533 --> 00:04:26.826
I was like... [inhales]

89
00:04:27.952 --> 00:04:29.037
[exhales slowly]

90
00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:33.166
- [exhales forcefully]
- [audience laughing]


91
00:04:33.249 --> 00:04:36.627
Even people that were driving by
were like, "Oh shit!"


92
00:04:39.255 --> 00:04:41.966
But anybody who was like a real smoker
saw me throw it away


93
00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:45.011
was like, "Yo, dumbass,
that's a full cigarette. What the..."


94
00:04:45.094 --> 00:04:46.721
[audience laughing]

95
00:04:46.804 --> 00:04:49.265
But nah, man,
I'm trying to be a little healthier.


96
00:04:49.349 --> 00:04:50.725
I had a water today.

97
00:04:50.808 --> 00:04:52.602
[audience chuckling]

98
00:04:52.685 --> 00:04:54.062
Yeah. It's a lifestyle.

99
00:04:54.145 --> 00:04:55.313
[audience laughing]

100
00:04:57.273 --> 00:04:59.317
Nah, I never... 
I never drink water.

101
00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:00.610
I drink a lot of soda.

102
00:05:01.152 --> 00:05:05.073
I don't like when healthy people find out
that they drink more water than I do.


103
00:05:05.573 --> 00:05:09.410
'Cause you can see it in their face.
They immediately start feeling superior.


104
00:05:09.952 --> 00:05:13.206
Whenever somebody finds out
they drink more water than you,


105
00:05:13.289 --> 00:05:16.250
they start talking to you
like if they get laid more than you.


106
00:05:17.043 --> 00:05:18.461
They say cocky shit.

107
00:05:19.212 --> 00:05:22.298
Say shit like,
"You haven't had any water today?"


108
00:05:22.382 --> 00:05:24.384
[audience laughing]

109
00:05:25.468 --> 00:05:28.429
I'm like, "No."
They're like... [scoffs] "Fuckin' up."


110
00:05:28.513 --> 00:05:30.515
[audience laughing]

111
00:05:33.267 --> 00:05:35.186
Yeah, it's just cooler to be healthy, man.

112
00:05:35.269 --> 00:05:38.439
It's, like, in style to drink water,
and I don't like it.


113
00:05:38.523 --> 00:05:40.691
- [audience laughing]
- This is out of hand, man.


114
00:05:40.775 --> 00:05:43.820
It's gotten to the point
that people will judge you, even,


115
00:05:43.903 --> 00:05:46.280
just based off of
the brand of water you drink.


116
00:05:47.073 --> 00:05:49.617
I had a FIJI Water
at the barbershop the other day.


117
00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:51.869
Everybody was like, "You like that one?"

118
00:05:51.953 --> 00:05:53.079
[audience laughing]

119
00:05:53.162 --> 00:05:54.372
I was like, "Nah."

120
00:05:54.455 --> 00:05:56.457
[audience laughing]

121
00:06:00.711 --> 00:06:03.714
I didn't even know what I did wrong.
I was like, "Nah, I don't like it."


122
00:06:03.798 --> 00:06:05.216
[audience laughing]

123
00:06:05.299 --> 00:06:08.719
"I was just holding onto it
for this girl I have sex with sometimes."


124
00:06:08.803 --> 00:06:10.763
[audience laughing]

125
00:06:11.764 --> 00:06:14.600
I don't know which one
the "cool" water is to drink.


126
00:06:14.684 --> 00:06:17.645
I know which one the lame one is.
It's the one that I like.


127
00:06:18.729 --> 00:06:20.189
I like drinking Dasani.

128
00:06:20.273 --> 00:06:21.899
[audience laughing]

129
00:06:21.983 --> 00:06:24.068
- [scattered boos]
- Yeah. Didn't I tell you they judge?


130
00:06:24.152 --> 00:06:26.154
[audience laughing]

131
00:06:26.863 --> 00:06:29.407
Dasani takes me back to my childhood.

132
00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:33.369
Dasani's the only water
that tastes like outside water hose.


133
00:06:33.453 --> 00:06:35.455
[audience laughing]

134
00:06:35.538 --> 00:06:36.873
Tastes like <i>manguera.</i>

135
00:06:36.956 --> 00:06:39.750
[audience laughing and cheering]

136
00:06:39.834 --> 00:06:40.835
Yeah.

137
00:06:41.627 --> 00:06:43.629
I don't even care if I'm inside, man.

138
00:06:43.713 --> 00:06:46.424
I'll buy me a bottle, I open it up,
and I drink it like this.


139
00:06:47.133 --> 00:06:51.929
[audience laughing and applauding]

140
00:06:52.013 --> 00:06:54.348
[cheering]

141
00:07:00.771 --> 00:07:03.149
Trying to take care of my vision.
I got glasses.


142
00:07:03.232 --> 00:07:06.819
I don't... I don't need 'em too much.
I need 'em to, like, drive at night.


143
00:07:06.903 --> 00:07:08.821
For some reason,
once it gets dark outside,


144
00:07:08.905 --> 00:07:10.907
I just can't see
little things on the road,


145
00:07:10.990 --> 00:07:12.617
like innocent pedestrians and...

146
00:07:12.700 --> 00:07:14.744
[audience laughing]

147
00:07:14.827 --> 00:07:17.413
But I don't like to wear 'em, man.
Some people can rock glasses.


148
00:07:17.497 --> 00:07:20.291
I tried, like,
all the different glasses, and...


149
00:07:20.374 --> 00:07:22.877
I don't know. They all look lame on me.
I feel real dorky.


150
00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:25.505
My biggest fear
is that I will wear them while I drive,


151
00:07:25.588 --> 00:07:26.839
and then I'll crash, and...

152
00:07:26.923 --> 00:07:27.882
[audience laughing]

153
00:07:27.965 --> 00:07:29.717
...paramedics will find my body and be like,

154
00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:32.553
"Aw, man.
We have one dead nerd over here."


155
00:07:32.637 --> 00:07:34.639
[audience laughing]

156
00:07:36.516 --> 00:07:38.601
"Let's get this lame ass on a stretcher."

157
00:07:38.684 --> 00:07:40.686
[audience laughing]

158
00:07:45.024 --> 00:07:47.318
If I ever crash and die,
I hope they don't even find my car.


159
00:07:47.401 --> 00:07:48.945
It's dirty. It's embarrassing.

160
00:07:49.028 --> 00:07:51.155
[audience laughing]

161
00:07:51.239 --> 00:07:53.616
I got, like, half-empty bottles of soda,

162
00:07:54.992 --> 00:07:56.244
a basketball,

163
00:07:57.870 --> 00:08:00.915
one brand-new,
never-opened box of condoms...


164
00:08:00.998 --> 00:08:03.292
[audience laughing]

165
00:08:03.376 --> 00:08:05.461
They find my body in my car,
they'll be like,


166
00:08:05.545 --> 00:08:07.838
"Man, this dude
was one dehydrated virgin."


167
00:08:07.922 --> 00:08:10.633
[audience laughing]

168
00:08:13.177 --> 00:08:15.179
I could clean it, but I'm too lazy.

169
00:08:15.263 --> 00:08:17.473
Instead, what I did
is I got that box of condoms,


170
00:08:17.557 --> 00:08:20.309
there was like three in there,
I threw two of them away.


171
00:08:21.352 --> 00:08:24.397
Now if they find my body in there,
they're gonna be like, "This guy...


172
00:08:25.064 --> 00:08:26.148
he was all right."

173
00:08:26.232 --> 00:08:28.234
[audience laughing]

174
00:08:29.860 --> 00:08:30.820
[woman cheers]

175
00:08:33.322 --> 00:08:34.365
Yeah, man.

176
00:08:34.448 --> 00:08:37.243
I've been, uh, I've been seeing somebody.
It's going really good.


177
00:08:37.326 --> 00:08:39.870
I haven't been
in a relationship for a while,


178
00:08:39.954 --> 00:08:43.291
and I'm realizing
how jealous of a dude I am.


179
00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:47.086
I was asking my girl, I was like,
"Have you ever gone skydiving before?"


180
00:08:47.169 --> 00:08:48.921
She was like, "Yeah, 
I went skydiving...

181
00:08:49.672 --> 00:08:50.923
with my ex-boyfriend."

182
00:08:52.550 --> 00:08:54.427
I didn't need that extra information...

183
00:08:54.510 --> 00:08:56.387
[audience laughing]

184
00:08:56.470 --> 00:08:57.430
...like, at all.

185
00:08:59.599 --> 00:09:02.935
And in my mind, all I heard was, like,
"Yeah, I went skydiving before."


186
00:09:03.019 --> 00:09:06.188
"Also, just as a reminder,
I used to fuck somebody else."


187
00:09:06.272 --> 00:09:09.066
[audience laughing and applauding]

188
00:09:12.820 --> 00:09:13.821
But it... [chuckles]

189
00:09:13.904 --> 00:09:16.824
It's 'cause she never gets jealous.
She doesn't understand jealousy, man.


190
00:09:16.907 --> 00:09:18.868
She got a... She's got a healthy mindset.

191
00:09:18.951 --> 00:09:19.952
Her parents...

192
00:09:20.036 --> 00:09:21.871
[audience laughing]

193
00:09:22.538 --> 00:09:24.540
Her parents have
a real healthy relationship.


194
00:09:24.624 --> 00:09:25.625
She said growing up,

195
00:09:25.708 --> 00:09:28.836
her parents never once argued
in front of her and her siblings.


196
00:09:28.919 --> 00:09:32.673
They'd go to another room if they had to,
but never in front of the kids.


197
00:09:32.757 --> 00:09:35.051
I... I was raised by my grandparents,

198
00:09:35.134 --> 00:09:39.263
and I'm convinced that they would wait
till got home from school...


199
00:09:39.347 --> 00:09:41.349
[audience laughing]

200
00:09:45.394 --> 00:09:47.897
They were like,
"He needs to hear this, goddammit."


201
00:09:47.980 --> 00:09:49.523
[audience laughing]

202
00:09:51.817 --> 00:09:52.777
Nah, I'm...

203
00:09:54.612 --> 00:09:57.573
I'm kidding.
My grandparents never... spoke English.


204
00:09:57.657 --> 00:09:59.659
[audience laughing]

205
00:10:02.953 --> 00:10:06.040
Man, she's cool, man, she's cool.
Her family's real religious.


206
00:10:06.123 --> 00:10:08.376
My girlfriend always wants us
to pray before we eat


207
00:10:08.459 --> 00:10:11.128
so that we could show
that we're thankful for things, you know?


208
00:10:11.212 --> 00:10:13.547
Which, I agree.
I'll pray for things I'm thankful for.


209
00:10:13.631 --> 00:10:15.549
I don't wanna pray before every meal,

210
00:10:15.633 --> 00:10:18.678
but I'll pray before things
that I'm really thankful for.


211
00:10:18.761 --> 00:10:19.929
Like sex.

212
00:10:20.012 --> 00:10:22.014
[audience laughing]

213
00:10:22.640 --> 00:10:25.476
She's like, "You're more thankful for sex
than for food?"


214
00:10:26.227 --> 00:10:27.144
[blows air]

215
00:10:27.228 --> 00:10:29.230
[audience laughing]

216
00:10:31.315 --> 00:10:32.566
I was like, "I mean..."

217
00:10:32.650 --> 00:10:35.152
[audience laughing]

218
00:10:36.028 --> 00:10:38.698
"I never went six months
without eating before."


219
00:10:38.781 --> 00:10:41.701
[raucous laughter and applause]

220
00:10:45.037 --> 00:10:46.580
[audience cheering]

221
00:10:50.501 --> 00:10:52.378
I didn't starve through high school.

222
00:10:52.461 --> 00:10:53.963
[audience laughing]

223
00:11:00.845 --> 00:11:02.096
She wants us to go to church,

224
00:11:02.179 --> 00:11:05.141
but I don't even know
if I'm that religious.


225
00:11:05.224 --> 00:11:07.893
Like, I'm one of those people,
like, I believe in God,


226
00:11:07.977 --> 00:11:09.729
but I don't go to church, you know?

227
00:11:09.812 --> 00:11:12.356
I think there's a lot of us like that,
that we believe...


228
00:11:12.440 --> 00:11:13.941
We don't have to go to church,

229
00:11:14.024 --> 00:11:17.653
but as long as we're just good enough,
God will still let us into heaven.


230
00:11:17.737 --> 00:11:19.697
[audience laughing and applauding]

231
00:11:19.780 --> 00:11:21.323
Yeah, 'cause in my mind,

232
00:11:21.407 --> 00:11:24.285
God is like
those police captains in the movies.


233
00:11:24.827 --> 00:11:26.912
He's like,
"Mm, you don't play it by the book,


234
00:11:26.996 --> 00:11:29.498
but you're a good detective, goddammit.
You're in."


235
00:11:29.582 --> 00:11:31.542
[audience laughing]

236
00:11:33.836 --> 00:11:36.255
And I'm just at the gates,
like, "Thanks, Chief."


237
00:11:36.338 --> 00:11:38.299
[audience laughing]

238
00:11:41.051 --> 00:11:43.387
I just... I just don't like
going to church, man.


239
00:11:43.471 --> 00:11:45.264
I don't like the people there.

240
00:11:45.347 --> 00:11:47.683
People at church
have, like, co-worker vibes.


241
00:11:47.767 --> 00:11:49.810
[audience laughing]

242
00:11:50.936 --> 00:11:52.229
Like, some of them are cool,

243
00:11:52.313 --> 00:11:54.565
but most of them, you know,
they're just being fake nice


244
00:11:54.648 --> 00:11:56.317
'cause they want that promotion.

245
00:11:56.400 --> 00:11:58.402
[audience laughing]

246
00:12:02.615 --> 00:12:05.701
I don't know. I've never liked the people
at the churches that I've gone to, man.


247
00:12:05.785 --> 00:12:08.245
If those are the people that
are gonna be hanging out in heaven,


248
00:12:08.329 --> 00:12:09.955
I just... I'll just go to hell.

249
00:12:10.039 --> 00:12:12.041
[audience laughing]

250
00:12:19.507 --> 00:12:22.426
But yeah, no,
relationship's been going good, you know.


251
00:12:22.510 --> 00:12:25.596
I would like to settle down, man,
you know, 'cause I really like girls.


252
00:12:25.679 --> 00:12:28.224
I've been liking them
a long time now, actually.


253
00:12:28.307 --> 00:12:30.309
[audience laughing]

254
00:12:34.146 --> 00:12:36.357
I think I have
lots of good traits about me.


255
00:12:36.440 --> 00:12:38.234
Like I'm a really good kisser.

256
00:12:39.026 --> 00:12:41.028
I'm bad at sex,
but I'm a good kisser.

257
00:12:41.111 --> 00:12:42.279
[audience laughing]

258
00:12:42.363 --> 00:12:45.741
I'm like a really cool movie trailer
to a really bad movie.


259
00:12:45.825 --> 00:12:47.785
[audience laughing]

260
00:12:51.664 --> 00:12:54.542
And, like, I know I'm good,
'cause when I'm kissing girls,


261
00:12:54.625 --> 00:12:57.086
they almost start to moan.
They're like... [moaning]


262
00:12:57.169 --> 00:12:58.921
[audience laughing]

263
00:12:59.755 --> 00:13:02.424
But then we have sex,
and they're like... [questioning moan]


264
00:13:02.508 --> 00:13:04.969
[audience laughing and applauding]

265
00:13:08.639 --> 00:13:10.057
But whatever. I have fun.

266
00:13:10.140 --> 00:13:12.142
[audience laughing]

267
00:13:16.772 --> 00:13:20.234
When they do like it, I'm like,
"You don't know what good is, do you?"


268
00:13:20.317 --> 00:13:22.319
[audience laughing]

269
00:13:23.237 --> 00:13:25.614
Like, "You have bad taste.
I can't be with you."


270
00:13:25.698 --> 00:13:27.700
[audience laughing]

271
00:13:30.744 --> 00:13:33.038
But I think
I have lots of good traits, man.


272
00:13:33.122 --> 00:13:35.875
Like I don't have
that old-school mentality,


273
00:13:35.958 --> 00:13:37.418
that old-school way of thinking,

274
00:13:37.501 --> 00:13:40.504
where they say the woman is the one
who has to do the cooking


275
00:13:40.588 --> 00:13:42.298
and have dinner ready every night,

276
00:13:42.381 --> 00:13:45.301
and only she does the dishes,
only she cleans the house,


277
00:13:45.384 --> 00:13:47.094
only she does the laundry.

278
00:13:47.177 --> 00:13:48.345
I don't think that way.

279
00:13:48.888 --> 00:13:50.264
I just want a girl...

280
00:13:51.056 --> 00:13:52.600
who <i>does</i> think that way.

281
00:13:52.683 --> 00:13:53.934
[audience laughing]

282
00:14:05.112 --> 00:14:07.197
I'm... I'm much more progressive than that.

283
00:14:07.281 --> 00:14:10.451
But if my wife isn't, I just have
to love and support her, you know?


284
00:14:10.534 --> 00:14:12.536
[audience laughing]

285
00:14:15.748 --> 00:14:20.002
I used to, like, sit and wonder,
like, who would my dream girl be?


286
00:14:20.085 --> 00:14:22.338
And I love cars. 
I really like cars.

287
00:14:22.421 --> 00:14:25.591
And I would always envision
my dream girl would be a girl


288
00:14:25.674 --> 00:14:28.052
who races cars, illegally.

289
00:14:28.135 --> 00:14:29.178
[audience laughing]

290
00:14:29.261 --> 00:14:30.763
'Cause that's the hot part, you know?

291
00:14:30.846 --> 00:14:34.016
It'd probably be even hotter
if she was also illegal.


292
00:14:34.099 --> 00:14:36.101
[audience laughing]

293
00:14:37.519 --> 00:14:38.437
Yeah.

294
00:14:39.229 --> 00:14:41.815
'Cause when she's speeding,
she's really risking it.


295
00:14:41.899 --> 00:14:43.901
[audience laughing]

296
00:14:47.196 --> 00:14:50.324
I'd like a girl who, she drives,
she takes the wheel, you know?


297
00:14:50.407 --> 00:14:52.451
I wanna be passenger prince for once.

298
00:14:52.534 --> 00:14:54.536
[audience laughing]

299
00:14:57.164 --> 00:14:59.708
I would love to be with a girl who,
she's like,


300
00:14:59.792 --> 00:15:01.794
she's leaning on her car, you know...

301
00:15:02.836 --> 00:15:05.172
she's chillin', all badass.

302
00:15:07.257 --> 00:15:11.053
[audience laughing and applauding]

303
00:15:12.179 --> 00:15:14.848
And her enemies are rolling up on us.

304
00:15:17.434 --> 00:15:18.435
She's like, "Ralph."

305
00:15:18.978 --> 00:15:21.981
I'm back here, I pump the shotgun like...
[mimics shotgun loading] "Here you go."


306
00:15:22.064 --> 00:15:24.066
[audience laughing]

307
00:15:28.445 --> 00:15:31.699
That's 'cause, like, I see those movies
like <i>Fast and the Furious</i> and all those,


308
00:15:31.782 --> 00:15:33.075
there's always the main dude.

309
00:15:33.158 --> 00:15:35.995
He's the driver, he's the fighter,
he's the shooter, you know.


310
00:15:36.078 --> 00:15:38.080
And then there's always
the girl riding passenger.


311
00:15:38.163 --> 00:15:40.290
She has his back. 
She's ride or die.

312
00:15:40.374 --> 00:15:43.168
I'm like, "Man, I'd like to be
like that girl, but to my girl."


313
00:15:43.252 --> 00:15:45.212
[audience laughing]

314
00:15:49.758 --> 00:15:52.094
I can already envision,
like, my dream life


315
00:15:52.177 --> 00:15:53.262
with my dream girl.

316
00:15:54.596 --> 00:15:56.974
It's late at night,
my window's cracked open,


317
00:15:57.057 --> 00:15:58.434
little breeze coming in.

318
00:15:59.018 --> 00:16:00.227
I'm already laying in bed,

319
00:16:00.310 --> 00:16:02.813
'cause I'm not even
expecting to go out, even.


320
00:16:02.896 --> 00:16:04.898
[audience laughing]

321
00:16:09.194 --> 00:16:12.698
And then from down the street,
like, getting closer and closer,


322
00:16:12.781 --> 00:16:14.033
I can just hear...

323
00:16:14.742 --> 00:16:17.619
[mimicking engine roaring]

324
00:16:17.703 --> 00:16:19.580
[audience laughing]

325
00:16:19.663 --> 00:16:21.832
I get up, I'm like,
"Oh my God, she's here."


326
00:16:21.915 --> 00:16:24.668
[audience laughing]

327
00:16:27.880 --> 00:16:29.548
Start putting on deodorant.

328
00:16:29.631 --> 00:16:31.216
[audience laughing]

329
00:16:31.300 --> 00:16:33.427
She texts me, she's like, "I'm outside."

330
00:16:34.553 --> 00:16:36.638
I'm like, "I know. 
My dad heard you."

331
00:16:36.722 --> 00:16:39.141
[audience laughing and applauding]

332
00:16:40.517 --> 00:16:43.687
[audience cheering]

333
00:16:47.191 --> 00:16:49.443
And my girl, she's gonna pull up
in something nice, man.


334
00:16:49.526 --> 00:16:51.987
Something real car enthusiasts
can respect.


335
00:16:52.071 --> 00:16:54.073
Not your average Honda, Charger, nah.

336
00:16:54.156 --> 00:16:56.617
She's pullin' up,
like, in the Nissan Skyline.


337
00:16:56.700 --> 00:16:58.243
[audience laughing]

338
00:16:58.327 --> 00:17:00.621
She drives the R34 version.

339
00:17:00.704 --> 00:17:02.790
She... she has the other versions too,

340
00:17:02.873 --> 00:17:05.125
but tonight,
she brought this one out for me.


341
00:17:05.209 --> 00:17:06.877
[audience laughing]

342
00:17:08.045 --> 00:17:10.798
She picks me up.
She's driving, 'cause I'm progressive.


343
00:17:10.881 --> 00:17:12.883
[audience laughing]

344
00:17:16.553 --> 00:17:18.806
And, you know, she just takes us
cruising through the city.


345
00:17:18.889 --> 00:17:22.017
She's showing the car off, showing me off...

346
00:17:22.101 --> 00:17:24.103
[audience laughing]

347
00:17:27.648 --> 00:17:30.359
I'm riding passenger,
I'm taking Boomerangs...


348
00:17:30.442 --> 00:17:32.194
[audience laughing]

349
00:17:37.032 --> 00:17:38.200
I'm in there like...

350
00:17:38.283 --> 00:17:41.161
[raucous laughter and applause]

351
00:17:43.247 --> 00:17:47.084
[audience cheering]

352
00:17:50.963 --> 00:17:54.299
I'm posting them on my Instagram story,
like "Date night."


353
00:17:54.383 --> 00:17:56.385
[audience laughing]

354
00:17:57.344 --> 00:18:00.931
All my boys are replying to the story,
like, "I love this for y'all."


355
00:18:01.014 --> 00:18:03.308
[audience laughing]

356
00:18:12.401 --> 00:18:14.987
I'm like, "Thanks, bro.
We gotta get together soon."


357
00:18:15.070 --> 00:18:17.072
[audience laughing]

358
00:18:22.786 --> 00:18:24.413
He's like, "Bitch, 
I've been sayin'."

359
00:18:24.496 --> 00:18:26.498
[audience laughing]

360
00:18:31.044 --> 00:18:32.629
But I don't hang
out with him. He's fake.

361
00:18:32.713 --> 00:18:35.382
[audience laughing]

362
00:18:42.890 --> 00:18:45.642
Anyway... now it's later in the night,

363
00:18:45.726 --> 00:18:47.811
she's... she's taking me home.

364
00:18:47.895 --> 00:18:50.439
I was supposed to be home
a long time ago, but, ah.


365
00:18:50.522 --> 00:18:52.524
[audience laughing]

366
00:18:53.609 --> 00:18:54.818
My dad doesn't own me.

367
00:18:54.902 --> 00:18:56.904
[audience laughing]

368
00:18:59.114 --> 00:19:01.825
On the way home,
we stop at this red light.


369
00:19:02.534 --> 00:19:05.412
And it's empty.
There's no other cars there. It's just us.


370
00:19:05.495 --> 00:19:07.623
And my girl gives me this look.
She's like...


371
00:19:09.124 --> 00:19:10.459
I'm like, "What the hell?"

372
00:19:13.545 --> 00:19:15.881
I'm like,
"Does she want me to give her head?"


373
00:19:15.964 --> 00:19:17.966
[audience laughing]

374
00:19:27.226 --> 00:19:28.769
"Are all women like this?"

375
00:19:28.852 --> 00:19:30.812
[audience laughing]

376
00:19:34.399 --> 00:19:36.151
But nah, she was
just trying to show off.

377
00:19:36.235 --> 00:19:39.071
She gave me that look,
and then she started revving the engines.


378
00:19:39.154 --> 00:19:42.491
[mimicking engine revving]

379
00:19:43.784 --> 00:19:45.202
I'm like, "Babe, stop."

380
00:19:45.285 --> 00:19:47.287
[audience laughing]

381
00:19:50.457 --> 00:19:52.834
But that's baby.
She loves to flex, you know?


382
00:19:52.918 --> 00:19:54.670
[audience laughing]

383
00:19:54.753 --> 00:19:56.421
I say "stop," but I like it.

384
00:19:56.505 --> 00:19:57.631
[audience laughing]

385
00:20:02.844 --> 00:20:04.346
Then all of a sudden,

386
00:20:05.514 --> 00:20:07.516
just as I began to give her head...

387
00:20:07.599 --> 00:20:10.185
[audience laughing]

388
00:20:13.605 --> 00:20:16.525
...this douchey-type girl
pulls up next to us in her car.


389
00:20:17.484 --> 00:20:19.403
And she's pretty, and her car's all right.

390
00:20:19.486 --> 00:20:21.530
Just not as cool
as my girl's, you know...

391
00:20:22.030 --> 00:20:24.908
She's driving, like, a 2008 Mustang.

392
00:20:24.992 --> 00:20:25.826
Ew.

393
00:20:25.909 --> 00:20:27.911
[audience laughing]

394
00:20:29.621 --> 00:20:32.082
'Cause that year,
they didn't even make 'em in 5.0s.


395
00:20:32.165 --> 00:20:33.583
She's drivin' a 4.6.

396
00:20:34.584 --> 00:20:37.087
But she has 5.0 energy.
I'll give her that much.


397
00:20:39.006 --> 00:20:41.925
She pulls up next to us,
she's looking at our rims,


398
00:20:42.009 --> 00:20:44.011
she's lookin' inside our car...

399
00:20:44.845 --> 00:20:46.972
undressing me with her eyes.

400
00:20:47.055 --> 00:20:48.432
[audience laughing]

401
00:20:49.057 --> 00:20:51.184
I'm like, "Man, she ain't got no respect."

402
00:20:51.268 --> 00:20:53.270
[audience laughing]

403
00:20:54.104 --> 00:20:56.857
And my girl doesn't like that.
No, sir. Not one bit.


404
00:20:56.940 --> 00:20:58.942
[audience laughing]

405
00:21:00.068 --> 00:21:03.363
But my girl keeps it cool.
She keeps her composure, you know?


406
00:21:03.447 --> 00:21:06.491
My girl just looks at her,
and then she looks at me...


407
00:21:07.701 --> 00:21:10.829
And if you're wondering why she's driving
but looking this way at me,


408
00:21:10.912 --> 00:21:14.333
it's 'cause the Nissan Skyline has
the driver's seat on the opposite side.


409
00:21:15.292 --> 00:21:17.669
It's a Japanese car.
She got it imported from Japan.


410
00:21:17.753 --> 00:21:18.920
My girl has money.

411
00:21:19.004 --> 00:21:21.923
[audience laughing and applauding]

412
00:21:25.552 --> 00:21:28.680
She looks at me, and I just
look back at my girl like... [scoffs]


413
00:21:30.682 --> 00:21:31.892
"Kick her ass, babe."

414
00:21:31.975 --> 00:21:33.977
[audience laughing]

415
00:21:34.686 --> 00:21:38.523
And I say I'm loyal, but honestly,
whoever wins that race, they could get it.


416
00:21:38.607 --> 00:21:40.567
[audience laughing]

417
00:21:46.365 --> 00:21:48.492
But, yeah,
I was raised by my grandparents.


418
00:21:48.575 --> 00:21:49.993
[audience laughing]

419
00:21:52.287 --> 00:21:53.330
Which is cool.

420
00:21:53.413 --> 00:21:54.873
I'd see my parents too.

421
00:21:54.956 --> 00:21:57.292
They just had a lot going on.
They had crazy lives.


422
00:21:57.376 --> 00:22:01.463
My mom had a boyfriend I remember
that went to prison for selling dope,


423
00:22:01.546 --> 00:22:03.090
and she wanted to let me know,

424
00:22:03.173 --> 00:22:06.301
but she didn't want to tell a little kid
the cold, hard truth,


425
00:22:06.385 --> 00:22:08.470
so she told me like a sugar-coated truth.

426
00:22:09.012 --> 00:22:12.140
She was like, "Hey, listen,
Martin is gonna be away for a little while


427
00:22:12.224 --> 00:22:15.894
because he was caught
with moon rocks from the moon."


428
00:22:15.977 --> 00:22:17.646
[audience laughing]

429
00:22:17.729 --> 00:22:21.191
She's like, "Those are illegal on Earth.
They're these little white rocks..."


430
00:22:21.274 --> 00:22:23.360
"They don't want them on the planet, so...

431
00:22:25.195 --> 00:22:28.824
so the government is sending him
on a mission to the moon


432
00:22:28.907 --> 00:22:30.492
to return the rocks."

433
00:22:31.952 --> 00:22:34.413
She said, "I don't know
if you learned about this in school yet,


434
00:22:34.496 --> 00:22:37.332
but it takes, like, two years
just to get to the moon,


435
00:22:38.458 --> 00:22:42.129
about two years to get back,
just depending on his behavior..."


436
00:22:42.212 --> 00:22:44.214
[audience laughing]

437
00:22:46.716 --> 00:22:49.636
She's like, "Martin's gonna be gone
at least four to five."


438
00:22:50.554 --> 00:22:53.640
Which I believed, but at the same time,
even in my little-kid mind,


439
00:22:53.723 --> 00:22:57.853
I'm like, "Man. You know, I thought
to be an astronaut in the States,


440
00:22:57.936 --> 00:22:59.479
you had to know English."

441
00:22:59.563 --> 00:23:01.565
[audience laughing]

442
00:23:03.483 --> 00:23:05.986
I was like,
"Martin is flying a spaceship?"


443
00:23:06.069 --> 00:23:07.237
[audience laughing]

444
00:23:07.320 --> 00:23:09.739
"I have to help that man
order Chinese food."


445
00:23:09.823 --> 00:23:11.825
[audience laughing]

446
00:23:14.202 --> 00:23:17.038
So I was like, you know what?
Here's what I'm gonna do.


447
00:23:17.581 --> 00:23:19.666
Next time I see my dad,

448
00:23:20.250 --> 00:23:22.377
I'm gonna tell him
this whole Martin story.


449
00:23:22.461 --> 00:23:24.087
He'll tell me if it's real or not.

450
00:23:24.171 --> 00:23:26.173
Or, you know,
he'll tell me what it really means


451
00:23:26.256 --> 00:23:27.757
'cause he has no reason to lie.

452
00:23:27.841 --> 00:23:29.259
He doesn't even know Martin.

453
00:23:29.342 --> 00:23:31.094
I didn't know that during these times,

454
00:23:31.178 --> 00:23:34.473
my dad was also
a "pharmaceutical salesman."


455
00:23:34.556 --> 00:23:36.641
[audience laughing]

456
00:23:36.725 --> 00:23:39.519
So when I told him about Martin,
he just got real agitated.


457
00:23:39.603 --> 00:23:43.064
He was like, "Sometimes people gotta
go to the moon, man. It happens."


458
00:23:43.148 --> 00:23:45.150
[audience laughing]

459
00:23:47.319 --> 00:23:49.738
I was like,
"Damn. Are you gonna go to the moon?"


460
00:23:49.821 --> 00:23:50.989
[audience laughing]

461
00:23:51.072 --> 00:23:53.241
He was like,
"Nah, I'm not stupid, like Martin."


462
00:23:53.325 --> 00:23:56.119
[audience laughing and applauding]

463
00:24:01.708 --> 00:24:03.793
But that messed me up
so much in school, man,


464
00:24:03.877 --> 00:24:06.254
'cause they used to tell you,
"You work hard, get good grades,


465
00:24:06.338 --> 00:24:08.965
you can do anything you want.
Even be an astronaut."


466
00:24:09.049 --> 00:24:10.634
And I was like, "Ahh."

467
00:24:10.717 --> 00:24:12.719
[audience laughing]

468
00:24:13.553 --> 00:24:14.804
"I'm no dumbass."

469
00:24:14.888 --> 00:24:16.890
[audience laughing]

470
00:24:19.142 --> 00:24:21.686
But, yeah, my dad would pick me up.
He always had me looking nice.


471
00:24:21.770 --> 00:24:23.146
He'd buy me tons of shoes.

472
00:24:23.230 --> 00:24:26.274
I didn't know that the shoes
were funded by drug money, but...


473
00:24:26.358 --> 00:24:29.402
it definitely explains why every pair
came with a guilt trip.


474
00:24:30.403 --> 00:24:32.906
I think my dad felt so guilty
about how he got the money


475
00:24:32.989 --> 00:24:34.241
that anything he bought me,

476
00:24:34.324 --> 00:24:36.368
he'd put a tremendous amount
of pressure on me


477
00:24:36.451 --> 00:24:38.787
to, like, appreciate it
and take care of it.


478
00:24:38.870 --> 00:24:40.288
Be trying on shoes at the store,

479
00:24:40.372 --> 00:24:43.458
he's like, "You like those?
They fit? Those the ones you want?"


480
00:24:43.542 --> 00:24:45.335
I'm like,
"Yeah, Dad, I love these. Thank you."


481
00:24:45.418 --> 00:24:46.419
He's like, "You sure?"

482
00:24:46.962 --> 00:24:49.089
I'm like, "Yeah, I like these."
He's like, "All right."


483
00:24:50.257 --> 00:24:52.759
"'Cause a lot of people had to suffer
just for you to get those."


484
00:24:52.842 --> 00:24:54.970
[audience laughing]

485
00:24:56.179 --> 00:24:57.847
I was like, "Suffer? What the...?"

486
00:24:57.931 --> 00:24:59.266
[audience laughing]

487
00:24:59.349 --> 00:25:01.434
I didn't know what he was talking about.

488
00:25:01.518 --> 00:25:03.520
I was just walking up
to Foot Locker employees


489
00:25:03.603 --> 00:25:06.648
like, "Hey, I'm...
sorry for your pain, bro."


490
00:25:06.731 --> 00:25:08.733
[audience laughing]

491
00:25:09.317 --> 00:25:11.361
"I don't know what happens
when y'all walk back there,


492
00:25:11.444 --> 00:25:12.404
but be careful."

493
00:25:12.487 --> 00:25:14.489
[audience laughing]

494
00:25:17.200 --> 00:25:19.828
Now I think because of all that,
I'm, like, addicted to shoes, man.


495
00:25:19.911 --> 00:25:21.621
I love sneakers, you know?

496
00:25:21.705 --> 00:25:23.373
They give me tons of confidence.

497
00:25:23.915 --> 00:25:27.252
A brand-new pair of Nikes
will have me forgetting I'm only 5'7".


498
00:25:27.335 --> 00:25:29.337
[audience laughing]

499
00:25:30.255 --> 00:25:33.925
I'll start walking up to tall girls
at the bar, like, "What's up, shorty?"


500
00:25:34.009 --> 00:25:36.011
[audience laughing]

501
00:25:38.388 --> 00:25:40.849
I'll be like, "Hey, come here.
I have to tell you something."


502
00:25:40.932 --> 00:25:42.892
[audience laughing]

503
00:25:45.854 --> 00:25:48.481
Any time I'm feeling bad,
I'll go buy me some news shoes.


504
00:25:48.565 --> 00:25:50.859
I just think retail therapy works, man.

505
00:25:50.942 --> 00:25:54.237
I think retail therapy
works better than actual therapy.


506
00:25:55.071 --> 00:25:57.907
You go to a therapist,
spend 200-300 bucks an hour,


507
00:25:57.991 --> 00:26:00.368
to talk to one,
and you'll feel better for a little bit,


508
00:26:00.452 --> 00:26:02.537
but you know you'll go home,
you'll look in the mirror,


509
00:26:02.621 --> 00:26:03.622
you're still ugly.

510
00:26:03.705 --> 00:26:05.290
[audience laughing]

511
00:26:05.373 --> 00:26:08.126
But retail therapy,
you look better, you feel better...


512
00:26:08.209 --> 00:26:10.253
Sometimes you don't even
have to spend money.


513
00:26:10.337 --> 00:26:12.672
Next time you're feeling down,
just go to the mall.


514
00:26:12.756 --> 00:26:15.467
Salespeople will lift you up
better than any therapist.


515
00:26:15.550 --> 00:26:16.718
[audience laughing]

516
00:26:16.801 --> 00:26:18.678
I was walking through the mall
a few months back.


517
00:26:18.762 --> 00:26:20.430
I was all, like, moping.

518
00:26:21.014 --> 00:26:23.850
This dude just runs up on me
with a back massager, puts it to my back.


519
00:26:23.933 --> 00:26:26.519
He's like, "My man, my man.
Are you a hard worker?"


520
00:26:26.603 --> 00:26:28.104
"You're a hard worker, right?"

521
00:26:28.188 --> 00:26:29.898
[audience laughing]

522
00:26:29.981 --> 00:26:32.359
I was like, "Honestly... I'm not."

523
00:26:32.442 --> 00:26:34.444
[audience laughing]

524
00:26:38.239 --> 00:26:41.201
He's like, "Nah, you're a hard worker.
I can see it in you."


525
00:26:42.160 --> 00:26:44.079
I was like, "All right. Yeah."

526
00:26:44.162 --> 00:26:45.121
[audience laughing]

527
00:26:45.205 --> 00:26:47.248
"I see it a
little bit too now. Yeah."

528
00:26:47.332 --> 00:26:49.334
[audience laughing]

529
00:26:51.127 --> 00:26:52.420
Day's turning around.

530
00:26:53.838 --> 00:26:56.800
He was like, "What you do is you tell
your girl about these back massagers,


531
00:26:56.883 --> 00:27:00.804
you tell her how hard you've been working,
and she'll come up here and buy you one."


532
00:27:01.304 --> 00:27:05.016
And I was just being honest at the time,
I was like, "I don't have a girl."


533
00:27:05.517 --> 00:27:06.518
He was like...

534
00:27:08.019 --> 00:27:10.605
"But you're gonna get a girl, man.
I know you will."


535
00:27:10.689 --> 00:27:12.691
[audience laughing]

536
00:27:13.191 --> 00:27:15.652
I was like, "Dude, I've known you
like 30 seconds,


537
00:27:16.403 --> 00:27:18.363
but I wish you
could have been my dad."

538
00:27:18.446 --> 00:27:19.823
[audience laughing]

539
00:27:19.906 --> 00:27:24.285
[audience applauding and cheering]

540
00:27:26.705 --> 00:27:29.666
But, yeah, man, for me,
the therapy's always been the shoes.


541
00:27:29.749 --> 00:27:32.752
Every new pair of shoes I buy

542
00:27:32.836 --> 00:27:35.880
feels like it's fixing
another emotional issue I have.


543
00:27:36.589 --> 00:27:39.008
Like these Nikes I'm wearing right now,
I was lacing them up,


544
00:27:39.092 --> 00:27:41.720
I was like, "Man, these are fresh
right here. Hell yeah."


545
00:27:42.220 --> 00:27:44.389
"So what if my dad's
on the moon right now."


546
00:27:44.472 --> 00:27:47.183
[audience laughing]

547
00:27:52.272 --> 00:27:53.481
Nah, he landed.

548
00:27:53.565 --> 00:27:55.567
[audience laughing]

549
00:27:57.694 --> 00:28:01.072
Living with my dad,
we live out in the country, which is nice.


550
00:28:01.156 --> 00:28:03.074
There's, like, a pond in our backyard.

551
00:28:03.158 --> 00:28:06.035
I've never lived near a pond.
I never had a pond to go to.


552
00:28:06.119 --> 00:28:07.912
And I didn't even think
I'd like it that much.


553
00:28:07.996 --> 00:28:10.832
Sometimes when I'm bored,
I go out to the pond to, you know...


554
00:28:11.332 --> 00:28:12.292
"ponder."

555
00:28:12.375 --> 00:28:14.377
[audience laughing]

556
00:28:17.005 --> 00:28:19.966
That joke is real funny to me
'cause you paid money for it.


557
00:28:20.049 --> 00:28:22.635
[raucous laughter]

558
00:28:25.972 --> 00:28:27.974
[cheering]

559
00:28:29.017 --> 00:28:31.436
Nah, but seriously,
you ever stare at a pond?


560
00:28:31.519 --> 00:28:33.104
You'll get stuck staring at it.

561
00:28:33.855 --> 00:28:35.523
It's like a reflection to your own soul.

562
00:28:35.607 --> 00:28:38.109
You can lie to yourself.
You can't lie to the pond.


563
00:28:38.193 --> 00:28:39.444
[audience laughing]

564
00:28:39.527 --> 00:28:42.155
I was staring at it
for, like, 30 minutes one time


565
00:28:42.238 --> 00:28:44.073
before I finally snapped out of it.

566
00:28:44.574 --> 00:28:45.867
I was like, "Oh damn...

567
00:28:48.036 --> 00:28:49.329
she's cheating on me."

568
00:28:49.412 --> 00:28:51.414
[audience laughing]

569
00:28:57.420 --> 00:28:59.839
I think my favorite part
about living in the country


570
00:28:59.923 --> 00:29:02.425
is, like, driving to the country,

571
00:29:02.509 --> 00:29:03.968
'cause the roads are real empty.

572
00:29:04.052 --> 00:29:06.846
It's real dark at night. You can see
the stars shining really bright.


573
00:29:06.930 --> 00:29:09.349
That's like the perfect time,
on those late-night drives,


574
00:29:09.432 --> 00:29:12.310
it's the perfect time
to, like, turn up a little music,


575
00:29:12.894 --> 00:29:14.312
spark up a little joint.

576
00:29:15.146 --> 00:29:17.565
It's so chill. 
It's so relaxing.

577
00:29:18.483 --> 00:29:20.068
But the police will ruin it.

578
00:29:20.151 --> 00:29:22.111
[audience laughing]

579
00:29:23.363 --> 00:29:25.532
This cop started driving behind me,
I got nervous,


580
00:29:25.615 --> 00:29:28.243
I put my joint out,
I put two hands on the wheel...


581
00:29:28.910 --> 00:29:31.538
Then I was like,
"Nah, too suspicious. Play it cool."


582
00:29:31.621 --> 00:29:33.581
[audience laughing]

583
00:29:37.377 --> 00:29:38.545
But I got nervous.

584
00:29:38.628 --> 00:29:41.339
We're in the middle of nowhere,
he was following me for 20 minutes,


585
00:29:41.422 --> 00:29:45.009
I'm paranoid, I'm high. I'm like,
"Is he gonna pull me over? Is he not?"


586
00:29:45.093 --> 00:29:46.970
And then I got this genius idea.

587
00:29:47.637 --> 00:29:48.763
[scattered laughter]

588
00:29:48.847 --> 00:29:51.015
I scooted over to my left lane,

589
00:29:52.642 --> 00:29:54.269
I slowed down a little bit,

590
00:29:55.562 --> 00:29:57.397
and then <i>I</i> got behind <i>him.</i>

591
00:29:57.480 --> 00:29:59.482
[audience laughing]

592
00:30:00.608 --> 00:30:03.236
You ever drive behind a cop?
It's a different energy.


593
00:30:04.362 --> 00:30:06.823
When he was behind me,
I was too nervous to smoke,


594
00:30:06.906 --> 00:30:09.742
but when I got behind him,
I sparked that bitch back up.


595
00:30:09.826 --> 00:30:13.121
[audience laughing and applauding]

596
00:30:13.204 --> 00:30:17.292
[audience cheering]

597
00:30:18.209 --> 00:30:20.753
I was like...
[inhales] "Where you gonna go?"


598
00:30:20.837 --> 00:30:22.881
[audience laughing]

599
00:30:22.964 --> 00:30:24.549
"You're in my world now."

600
00:30:26.426 --> 00:30:29.220
I started yelling out
Denzel lines from <i>Training Day.</i>


601
00:30:30.305 --> 00:30:32.765
I was like,
"Officer Hoyt, it's not what you know,


602
00:30:32.849 --> 00:30:34.350
it's what you can prove."

603
00:30:34.434 --> 00:30:36.394
[audience laughing]

604
00:30:36.477 --> 00:30:40.064
He was scared, man. I could tell
he was shook by the way he was driving.


605
00:30:40.148 --> 00:30:41.900
[audience laughing]

606
00:30:41.983 --> 00:30:43.985
Like, "Why you swerving like that, man?"

607
00:30:44.819 --> 00:30:48.281
He tried going to his left lane,
I was like, "Uh-uh. I know that one."


608
00:30:48.364 --> 00:30:50.366
[audience laughing]

609
00:30:52.368 --> 00:30:56.080
I wasn't gonna let him get away.
I wanted him to feel the fear that I felt.


610
00:30:56.706 --> 00:30:58.166
He tried getting off the highway,

611
00:30:58.249 --> 00:31:00.418
I'm like...
[scoffs] "That's my exit too. Let's go."


612
00:31:00.501 --> 00:31:02.420
[audience laughing]

613
00:31:02.503 --> 00:31:05.965
He did a U-turn. I was like,
"Yeah, I did forget something, actually."


614
00:31:06.049 --> 00:31:07.300
[audience laughing]

615
00:31:08.468 --> 00:31:10.762
I followed him
all the way back into the city.


616
00:31:11.471 --> 00:31:14.265
He took a left, I took a left.
He took a right, I took a right.


617
00:31:14.349 --> 00:31:17.810
I'm like, "Where you goin', man?
You gotta run out of gas eventually."


618
00:31:18.686 --> 00:31:21.481
I had another joint ready.
I'd never run out of gas.


619
00:31:21.564 --> 00:31:24.275
[raucous laughter and applause]

620
00:31:24.359 --> 00:31:26.569
[cheering]

621
00:31:31.783 --> 00:31:35.119
And just as I was about to spark it,
he put his signal light on.


622
00:31:35.203 --> 00:31:38.289
I was like, "Where we going?"
And I look, it was the police station.


623
00:31:38.373 --> 00:31:40.667
I was like,
"Fuck, it's a trap, it's a trap."


624
00:31:40.750 --> 00:31:42.627
[audience laughing]

625
00:31:42.710 --> 00:31:44.712
He was two steps ahead the whole time.

626
00:31:44.796 --> 00:31:46.506
[audience chuckling]

627
00:31:50.593 --> 00:31:53.262
No, but it's nice living out there.
I do get bored sometimes.


628
00:31:53.346 --> 00:31:54.973
I bought a PlayStation 5.

629
00:31:55.598 --> 00:31:58.351
I like it a lot. I went a long time
without having a PlayStation.


630
00:31:58.434 --> 00:32:01.813
I had the PlayStation 4
like a long time ago,


631
00:32:01.896 --> 00:32:04.524
back before smart TVs were really around.

632
00:32:04.607 --> 00:32:07.819
So I really depended on it.
But I had sold it to take a girl out.


633
00:32:07.902 --> 00:32:08.861
[audience chuckles]

634
00:32:08.945 --> 00:32:11.948
Yeah. Which kind of worked out.
She came back to my house.


635
00:32:12.532 --> 00:32:14.617
She was like, "You wanna watch Netflix?"

636
00:32:15.326 --> 00:32:17.829
I was like, "Yeah, I... 
I would like to."

637
00:32:17.912 --> 00:32:19.914
[audience laughing]

638
00:32:21.624 --> 00:32:25.294
She was like, "You don't have, like,
a PlayStation or an Xbox? Put it on."


639
00:32:25.378 --> 00:32:28.589
I was like, "Nah, you don't wanna
just watch the news?"


640
00:32:28.673 --> 00:32:30.633
[audience laughing]

641
00:32:34.053 --> 00:32:35.805
But yeah, man. 
I love that PlayStation 5.

642
00:32:35.888 --> 00:32:38.391
I like playing fighting games,
like <i>Mortal Kombat,</i> man.


643
00:32:38.474 --> 00:32:39.851
I'm good at fighting games.

644
00:32:39.934 --> 00:32:43.438
- Real life, not so much. But on the games...
- [audience laughing]


645
00:32:43.521 --> 00:32:45.440
I like playing with my cousins a lot.

646
00:32:45.523 --> 00:32:47.650
I hang out
with my older cousin Carlos a lot.


647
00:32:47.734 --> 00:32:50.069
But he's, like, too thug for video games.

648
00:32:50.611 --> 00:32:53.031
He's got too much of a temper, you know?
He can't take a loss.


649
00:32:53.114 --> 00:32:56.284
I was whooping him on <i>Mortal Kombat,</i>
and he threw my controller.


650
00:32:56.367 --> 00:32:58.745
He's like, "Man, fuck this game.
Hit me in real life."


651
00:32:58.828 --> 00:33:00.246
[audience laughing]

652
00:33:00.329 --> 00:33:02.331
[scattered applause]

653
00:33:03.708 --> 00:33:05.501
I was like, "Bro, go back to jail."

654
00:33:05.585 --> 00:33:07.587
[audience laughing]

655
00:33:13.426 --> 00:33:15.803
Anytime we go to bars,
he's always starting bar fights.


656
00:33:15.887 --> 00:33:18.347
Which, honestly, I like.
It's a win-win for me.


657
00:33:18.973 --> 00:33:21.350
'Cause if he wins the fight,
I could just go up to girls like...


658
00:33:21.434 --> 00:33:22.977
[blows air] "That's just how we do."

659
00:33:23.061 --> 00:33:24.937
[audience laughing]

660
00:33:25.021 --> 00:33:27.106
"We're related, so I could also do that."

661
00:33:27.190 --> 00:33:28.608
[audience chuckling]

662
00:33:28.691 --> 00:33:30.902
If somebody tries to fight me,
he'll stop it.


663
00:33:30.985 --> 00:33:33.613
He won't let anybody touch me, man.
He's very protective.


664
00:33:33.696 --> 00:33:36.074
There was one time
I got into a fight at a bar


665
00:33:36.157 --> 00:33:39.285
and he tried to come save me,
but we got surrounded by a crowd.


666
00:33:39.368 --> 00:33:42.205
He couldn't get through. He was trying
to coach me from behind the crowd.


667
00:33:42.288 --> 00:33:44.749
He's like, "Ralph, you've gotta slip
the jab, bob, weave."


668
00:33:44.832 --> 00:33:47.960
But I didn't know what any of that meant,
so I was getting whooped the whole time.


669
00:33:48.044 --> 00:33:50.046
[audience laughing]

670
00:33:50.963 --> 00:33:52.882
Then he put it into terms
I could understand.


671
00:33:52.965 --> 00:33:55.134
He was like,
"L1, square, square, triangle."


672
00:33:55.218 --> 00:33:58.304
[audience laughing and applauding]

673
00:34:00.223 --> 00:34:03.226
[audience cheering]

674
00:34:05.895 --> 00:34:08.439
He was like,
"Now do L1, R1 at the same time."


675
00:34:08.523 --> 00:34:09.982
I was like, "Hadouken!"

676
00:34:10.066 --> 00:34:12.693
[audience laughing and cheering]

677
00:34:19.408 --> 00:34:20.368
No, but...

678
00:34:21.577 --> 00:34:23.454
I'm too friendly to start bar fights, man.

679
00:34:23.538 --> 00:34:26.457
When I go to bars, I walk around
with Starbursts in my pocket.


680
00:34:27.583 --> 00:34:29.252
You don't want to fight that guy.

681
00:34:29.335 --> 00:34:31.045
[audience laughing]

682
00:34:31.921 --> 00:34:33.673
This girl at a bar
hit on me one time.

683
00:34:33.756 --> 00:34:35.800
I was talking to her
and her boyfriend came up to us.


684
00:34:35.883 --> 00:34:37.760
He was like,
"Yo, yo, yo. What the fuck is this?"


685
00:34:37.844 --> 00:34:39.053
I was like, "Hey."

686
00:34:39.137 --> 00:34:42.223
[audience laughing and applauding]

687
00:34:48.521 --> 00:34:51.232
He took a strawberry,
he was like, "All right, all right."


688
00:34:51.315 --> 00:34:53.526
[audience laughing]

689
00:34:53.609 --> 00:34:54.944
I was like, "Whew."

690
00:34:57.446 --> 00:34:58.447
[chuckles]

691
00:34:59.657 --> 00:35:00.533
Mm-hmm.

692
00:35:01.033 --> 00:35:03.327
I've been fortunate enough
to get to travel a little bit,


693
00:35:03.411 --> 00:35:04.537
which is cool.

694
00:35:04.620 --> 00:35:08.749
I took a $25 bus ride
from Dallas to Houston one time.


695
00:35:08.833 --> 00:35:10.334
It was like a four-hour drive.

696
00:35:10.418 --> 00:35:13.838
I remember thinking, "Man, 25 bucks
and they take you to a whole other city?"


697
00:35:13.921 --> 00:35:15.089
"That's a great deal."

698
00:35:16.048 --> 00:35:18.050
Then the driver started screaming at us.

699
00:35:18.134 --> 00:35:19.927
[audience laughing]

700
00:35:20.011 --> 00:35:22.471
I started to understand
the pricing a little more.


701
00:35:22.555 --> 00:35:24.098
[audience laughing]

702
00:35:25.349 --> 00:35:27.852
He was like, "Two things
before we get going on this drive


703
00:35:27.935 --> 00:35:29.187
I wanna make very clear."

704
00:35:29.270 --> 00:35:32.607
"One... there's no smoking
of any kind on my bus."


705
00:35:32.690 --> 00:35:35.568
"Do not smoke.
I don't care who you are. No smoking."


706
00:35:35.651 --> 00:35:36.861
I was like, "All right."

707
00:35:37.862 --> 00:35:38.863
[blows air]

708
00:35:38.946 --> 00:35:41.532
[audience laughing]

709
00:35:45.161 --> 00:35:46.287
He's like, "Second...

710
00:35:47.413 --> 00:35:49.874
nobody gets naked on my bus."

711
00:35:49.957 --> 00:35:51.125
[audience laughing]

712
00:35:51.209 --> 00:35:53.211
That's when I was like, "Ahh."

713
00:35:54.128 --> 00:35:56.130
"I overpaid for this trip."

714
00:35:56.214 --> 00:35:57.882
[audience laughing]

715
00:35:57.965 --> 00:35:59.842
He scared the hell out of me
when he said that


716
00:35:59.926 --> 00:36:02.178
because there was only
three of us on the bus.


717
00:36:02.261 --> 00:36:04.263
[audience laughing]

718
00:36:05.806 --> 00:36:07.892
I was like, "Sir,
do you know these two?"

719
00:36:07.975 --> 00:36:09.435
[audience laughing]

720
00:36:10.019 --> 00:36:14.023
Then I felt offended with them,
because what look do the three of us have


721
00:36:15.441 --> 00:36:18.569
that when this man saw us,
he was just like, "Mm-mm."


722
00:36:18.653 --> 00:36:20.738
[audience laughing]

723
00:36:20.821 --> 00:36:22.907
"These are some little sluts right here."

724
00:36:22.990 --> 00:36:24.784
[audience laughing]

725
00:36:26.327 --> 00:36:27.954
"I better make an announcement."

726
00:36:28.037 --> 00:36:29.372
[audience laughing]

727
00:36:32.166 --> 00:36:35.795
Like, "I... I'm grown, man.
You don't have to tell me to not get...


728
00:36:36.295 --> 00:36:39.006
to not get naked on a bus.
I'm not just gonna do that."


729
00:36:40.383 --> 00:36:41.717
That's what I told myself.

730
00:36:41.801 --> 00:36:43.636
[audience laughing]

731
00:36:44.637 --> 00:36:46.973
But I'll be honest.
Like 20 minutes into that ride,


732
00:36:47.056 --> 00:36:50.893
I was sitting there like,
"Don't... Don't get naked on the bus?"


733
00:36:50.977 --> 00:36:52.979
[audience laughing]

734
00:36:53.646 --> 00:36:56.232
I look back at those other two guys,
I was like, "Hey, he...


735
00:36:56.315 --> 00:36:59.068
he can't tell us
what to do with our bodies."


736
00:36:59.151 --> 00:37:01.153
[audience laughing]

737
00:37:05.283 --> 00:37:08.286
One thing I like about traveling
is going to different cities


738
00:37:08.369 --> 00:37:12.456
and trying, like, the junk food
that's famous out of that city.


739
00:37:12.540 --> 00:37:14.000
But, like, their local stuff.

740
00:37:14.083 --> 00:37:16.877
You know, from the hole-in-the-wall,
family-owned type businesses.


741
00:37:16.961 --> 00:37:19.297
That's where the best junk food
always comes from.


742
00:37:19.380 --> 00:37:21.590
I've also noticed
that every city's the same


743
00:37:21.674 --> 00:37:23.968
in the fact that the best junk food

744
00:37:24.051 --> 00:37:26.304
always comes from
the ghettoest neighborhoods.


745
00:37:26.971 --> 00:37:29.598
It's weird. It's like the more people
that have been shot in a place,


746
00:37:29.682 --> 00:37:31.017
the better the food gets.

747
00:37:32.601 --> 00:37:35.688
I don't even think it's anything
they do to the food in particular.


748
00:37:35.771 --> 00:37:37.606
I think it's just the fear.

749
00:37:38.816 --> 00:37:41.152
Like, knowing you can get shot
at any second,


750
00:37:41.235 --> 00:37:42.611
it makes you savor it more.

751
00:37:43.195 --> 00:37:45.072
You're like, "This might be my last."

752
00:37:45.156 --> 00:37:46.615
[audience chuckling]

753
00:37:46.699 --> 00:37:50.036
Sometimes I'll be having so much fun,
I'll drop my guard,


754
00:37:50.119 --> 00:37:53.789
and then I'll eat food that's so good,
it'll remind me to stay on my toes.


755
00:37:54.457 --> 00:37:56.625
You know, it's like 2:00 a.m.,
you leave the bar,


756
00:37:56.709 --> 00:37:58.836
you go to some late-night burger spot...

757
00:37:58.919 --> 00:38:01.213
You're just like,
"Damn, this burger's good."


758
00:38:02.673 --> 00:38:03.924
"A little too good."

759
00:38:04.008 --> 00:38:06.010
[audience laughing]

760
00:38:11.682 --> 00:38:15.353
Any time I'm in a different city
and wanna look for something good to eat,


761
00:38:15.436 --> 00:38:18.022
I never go on, like, 
Yelp or TikTok.

762
00:38:18.105 --> 00:38:19.732
I just... I just watch the news.

763
00:38:20.900 --> 00:38:24.445
I wait for them to be like,
"Local man shot at taco stand tonight."


764
00:38:24.945 --> 00:38:26.405
I'm like, "That's the spot."

[audience laughing]

766
00:38:29.784 --> 00:38:31.118
I'll go that same night.

767
00:38:33.454 --> 00:38:35.414
'Cause you know
there's not gonna be a line.


768
00:38:35.498 --> 00:38:37.083
[audience laughing]

769
00:38:37.666 --> 00:38:40.669
I'll go up there like,
"Yo, is this where that guy was shot?"


770
00:38:41.879 --> 00:38:43.839
"Whatever he had, 
I want six of those."

771
00:38:43.923 --> 00:38:45.216
[audience laughing]

772
00:38:45.299 --> 00:38:48.052
Or I'll go to, like,
the corporate junk food places too.


773
00:38:48.135 --> 00:38:51.222
I just don't like
when their customer service is too good.


774
00:38:51.305 --> 00:38:54.683
Like, if I go to somewhere
where I'm not spending that much money,


775
00:38:54.767 --> 00:38:56.852
and they're being super nice to me,

776
00:38:56.936 --> 00:38:58.229
it gets uncomfortable.

777
00:38:58.813 --> 00:39:00.648
Like... like at those Chick-fil
-As,

778
00:39:00.731 --> 00:39:02.608
[audience laughing]

779
00:39:03.109 --> 00:39:06.195
I'm just like, "All right.
Thank you for my chicken sandwich."


780
00:39:06.779 --> 00:39:07.947
"It's my pleasure."

781
00:39:08.030 --> 00:39:10.032
[audience laughing]

782
00:39:10.866 --> 00:39:11.700
"Yeah?"

783
00:39:11.784 --> 00:39:13.744
[audience laughing]

784
00:39:14.662 --> 00:39:16.247
"This is what does it for you?"

785
00:39:16.330 --> 00:39:17.998
[audience laughing]

786
00:39:18.958 --> 00:39:21.001
I'm like,
"You can have it back. I'm not even..."


787
00:39:21.085 --> 00:39:22.962
[audience laughing]

788
00:39:23.045 --> 00:39:25.840
- "I'm not even hungry anymore."
- [audience laughing]


789
00:39:26.424 --> 00:39:28.426
It only makes sense
when they treat you like that


790
00:39:28.509 --> 00:39:30.511
at the expensive, fancy restaurants.

791
00:39:30.594 --> 00:39:33.639
Those places where the more
money you spend, the nicer they get.


792
00:39:33.722 --> 00:39:35.891
Especially the service
in those places, man.


793
00:39:35.975 --> 00:39:39.228
When they're trying to earn a fat tip,
they'll be so nice to you,


794
00:39:39.311 --> 00:39:42.022
you almost feel like they're trying
to have sex with you a little bit.


795
00:39:42.982 --> 00:39:45.317
You'll be like, "Yo, can you bring us
another round of drinks


796
00:39:45.401 --> 00:39:47.278
and another order of that appetizer?"

797
00:39:47.361 --> 00:39:49.530
They're like,
"Yeah, of course. That's a smart choice."


798
00:39:49.613 --> 00:39:51.824
"You're a wise man,
and you have kind eyes."


799
00:39:51.907 --> 00:39:53.909
[audience laughing]

800
00:39:57.788 --> 00:40:00.666
I'm a sucker for it too.
I'll be like, "Yeah, I do all right."


801
00:40:00.749 --> 00:40:02.126
[audience laughing]

802
00:40:02.209 --> 00:40:03.377
"Here's more gratuity."

803
00:40:05.796 --> 00:40:07.756
It's not like that with fast food.

804
00:40:07.840 --> 00:40:11.051
With fast food, it's like the more
food I order, the madder they get.


805
00:40:11.135 --> 00:40:13.053
[audience laughing]

806
00:40:13.137 --> 00:40:15.723
We were on our way
to a house party once,

807
00:40:15.806 --> 00:40:18.893
and we stopped at a McDonald's
and ordered 100 McChickens.


808
00:40:20.769 --> 00:40:23.397
I could see the cook behind the counter.

809
00:40:23.481 --> 00:40:24.982
He had this look on his face

810
00:40:25.816 --> 00:40:27.526
where you could tell he...

811
00:40:27.610 --> 00:40:29.820
he didn't wanna have
sex with me at all.

812
00:40:29.904 --> 00:40:31.906
[audience laughing]

813
00:40:35.367 --> 00:40:38.287
I took one look at that man,
I was like, "He is not horny."


814
00:40:38.370 --> 00:40:40.372
[audience laughing]

815
00:40:43.292 --> 00:40:45.169
My first job was at a restaurant.

816
00:40:45.252 --> 00:40:46.462
When I was 12 years old,

817
00:40:46.545 --> 00:40:49.215
I was a dishwasher
at a Mexican seafood restaurant.


818
00:40:49.298 --> 00:40:52.176
Yeah. My grandma wanted me
to stay busy on the weekends.


819
00:40:52.259 --> 00:40:55.846
But I was just like, "Man, you...
You know there's, like, basketball...


820
00:40:57.515 --> 00:40:58.516
soccer," you know?

821
00:40:58.599 --> 00:41:01.435
She was like, "That stuff costs money,
this makes money. You gotta think."


822
00:41:01.519 --> 00:41:03.229
[audience laughing]

823
00:41:03.771 --> 00:41:06.857
Yeah, every Saturday and Sunday
from 10:00 a.m. to 10:00 p.m.,


824
00:41:06.941 --> 00:41:09.318
little 12-year-old me
washing dishes, you know?


825
00:41:09.401 --> 00:41:10.361
It wasn't that bad.

826
00:41:10.444 --> 00:41:12.988
My coworker... that dude, he was 11.

827
00:41:13.072 --> 00:41:15.074
[audience laughing]

828
00:41:17.117 --> 00:41:18.619
I was his supervisor.

829
00:41:18.702 --> 00:41:20.704
[audience laughing]

830
00:41:23.249 --> 00:41:26.961
I remember my first weekend there,
the older Mexican dudes got mad


831
00:41:27.044 --> 00:41:28.504
'cause I kept changing the radio.

832
00:41:28.587 --> 00:41:31.632
I couldn't get motivated
to the songs that they work to, man.


833
00:41:31.715 --> 00:41:35.678
Old Mexican dudes work their ass off
to the most lovey-dovey music


834
00:41:35.761 --> 00:41:36.971
all day at work.

835
00:41:37.513 --> 00:41:39.431
Which is wild 'cause right after work,

836
00:41:39.515 --> 00:41:41.892
they go home
and treat their women like shit.


837
00:41:41.976 --> 00:41:43.978
[raucous laughter]

838
00:41:48.566 --> 00:41:52.027
I remember one of the guys there,
he invited us to a cookout at his house,


839
00:41:52.111 --> 00:41:56.574
and it was wild to see him go
from chopping onions at work, like,


840
00:41:56.657 --> 00:41:59.410
<i>♪ Sabes que me gustas tanto ♪</i>

841
00:42:01.120 --> 00:42:03.622
And then that same night,
he's yelling at his wife like...


842
00:42:03.706 --> 00:42:05.249
<i>"Pendeja, vete para adentro."</i>

843
00:42:06.584 --> 00:42:10.170
I felt so bad for her. I was like,
"Oh my God. He's a sweetheart to us."


844
00:42:10.254 --> 00:42:12.256
[audience laughing]

845
00:42:14.633 --> 00:42:17.011
I was like, "Maybe you should
get a job with us, lady."


846
00:42:17.094 --> 00:42:19.096
[audience laughing]

847
00:42:19.179 --> 00:42:20.556
"Could save your marriage."

848
00:42:23.892 --> 00:42:26.312
I kept changing the radio,
and he screamed at me.


849
00:42:26.395 --> 00:42:28.689
He's like, <i>"No toques el radio.</i>
Don't touch the radio."


850
00:42:28.772 --> 00:42:30.274
I was like, "Whoa, damn."

851
00:42:30.357 --> 00:42:33.235
And then the next day,
I didn't talk, I didn't touch the radio.


852
00:42:33.319 --> 00:42:34.695
Just washed dishes all day.

853
00:42:34.778 --> 00:42:36.447
At the end of the night,
did a deep cleaning


854
00:42:36.530 --> 00:42:37.906
of the whole restaurant,

855
00:42:37.990 --> 00:42:39.783
and when the older Mexican dudes
were done,


856
00:42:39.867 --> 00:42:41.910
they sat on these boxes
in the middle of the kitchen,


857
00:42:41.994 --> 00:42:43.203
just talking, drinking.

858
00:42:43.287 --> 00:42:46.665
But I kept looking for things to clean.
I wanted to get back in their good graces


859
00:42:46.749 --> 00:42:49.335
and show them I'm a good kid,
I'm a hard worker.


860
00:42:49.418 --> 00:42:52.504
And then the one who screamed at me,
he called me over. He was like... [whistles]


861
00:42:53.297 --> 00:42:54.923
[audience chuckling]

862
00:42:55.007 --> 00:42:56.216
I went over there,

863
00:42:56.884 --> 00:42:59.136
and he got up off the box
and he pulled out a beer.


864
00:42:59.219 --> 00:43:00.763
He was like, <i>"¿Quiere una cerveza?"</i>

865
00:43:02.097 --> 00:43:03.474
He was offering me a beer.

866
00:43:04.016 --> 00:43:05.017
But I'm 12.

867
00:43:05.100 --> 00:43:07.645
[audience laughing]

868
00:43:07.728 --> 00:43:08.854
So I was like, "Okay."

869
00:43:08.937 --> 00:43:10.939
[audience laughing]

870
00:43:11.690 --> 00:43:13.233
I was like, <i>"Nomás dos."</i>

00:43:13.317 --> 00:43:15.569
[audience laughing]

872
00:43:15.653 --> 00:43:17.071
<i>"Mañana tengo escuela."</i>

[cheering and applauding]

00:43:27.331 --> 00:43:29.333
For any of my
non-Spanish-speaking friends,


876
00:43:29.416 --> 00:43:33.087
I basically let him know two is my cap
'cause I have school tomorrow.


877
00:43:33.170 --> 00:43:34.380
[audience laughing]

878
00:43:34.463 --> 00:43:37.424
No offense, but I don't wanna
work here the rest of my life with y'all.

[audience laughing]

880
00:43:43.597 --> 00:43:46.266
But he gave me that beer,
and I felt so cool, man.


881
00:43:46.350 --> 00:43:50.521
I got my beer, I'm hanging out
with the adults, listening to them talk.


882
00:43:50.604 --> 00:43:53.816
I wanted to talk too, but I couldn't
find anything that I could relate to


883
00:43:53.899 --> 00:43:54.900
so I could pitch in.

884
00:43:54.983 --> 00:43:57.152
You know, they're talking about
grown-people stuff,


885
00:43:57.236 --> 00:44:00.489
like their kids, their bills, their wives.

886
00:44:00.572 --> 00:44:02.241

[audience laughing]

888
00:44:04.993 --> 00:44:06.370
But I tried my best to relate, man.

889
00:44:06.453 --> 00:44:08.872
I took a swig of my beer,
I was like, "Mm."

00:44:08.956 --> 00:44:10.958
"Yeah, my girl might be trippin', bro."

[raucous laughter]

892
00:44:16.171 --> 00:44:18.882

[audience laughing]

894
00:44:28.434 --> 00:44:29.518
That's when I was 12.

895
00:44:29.601 --> 00:44:33.313
By the time I was 13,
I was tired... tired of working for the man.


896
00:44:33.939 --> 00:44:35.899
Started cutting hair out of my bedroom.

897
00:44:36.442 --> 00:44:39.695
The only way you can learn to cut hair
is by practicing on people.


898
00:44:40.404 --> 00:44:42.948
And none of my friends
wanted to let me practice on them.


899
00:44:43.449 --> 00:44:46.493
But, thankfully for me, all my friends

900
00:44:46.577 --> 00:44:48.162
were just poor enough...

901

[audience laughing]

902
00:44:49.705 --> 00:44:51.999
...they had no choice
but to let me practice on them.

00:44:52.082 --> 00:44:52.958
[audience laughing]

904
00:44:53.041 --> 00:44:55.711
A lot of them had single moms
and a lot of siblings.


905
00:44:55.794 --> 00:44:58.338
Their moms couldn't afford
to take them and their brothers


906
00:44:58.422 --> 00:45:00.007
to a real barbershop.

907
00:45:00.090 --> 00:45:02.801
So they'll bring them to me,
I'll cut their hair for free,


908
00:45:02.885 --> 00:45:05.804
and then their moms, to help me,
would post the pictures on Facebook.


909
00:45:05.888 --> 00:45:07.765
Like, "I keep my baby looking fresh."

It's just that sometimes,

00:45:19.026 --> 00:45:21.195
they would get too personal
with the posts.


915
00:45:21.278 --> 00:45:23.113
Post the pictures of the cuts,

916
00:45:23.197 --> 00:45:25.824
they'd be like, "I keep my babies

<i>and</i> I do it on my own.
No man paid for this."


918
00:45:29.787 --> 00:45:31.246
I'd be in the comments like,

919
00:45:31.330 --> 00:45:33.916
"Yeah, if anybody else
needs a free haircut..."


920
00:45:33.999 --> 00:45:36.001
[audience laughing]

921
00:45:37.294 --> 00:45:38.754
"...come to my grandma's."

922
00:45:38.837 --> 00:45:40.839
[audience laughing]

923
00:45:42.841 --> 00:45:46.970
Cutting hair from home is how I realized
my grandma didn't care about my safety.


924
00:45:47.054 --> 00:45:48.180
[audience laughing]

925
00:45:48.263 --> 00:45:51.433
There used to be grown men covered
in tattoos showing up at my doorstep,


926
00:45:51.517 --> 00:45:53.101
like, "Is little Ralphie here?"

927
00:45:54.228 --> 00:45:57.231
She'd be like,
"Yeah, he's in that room, by himself."


928
00:45:57.314 --> 00:46:00.150
[audience laughing]

929
00:46:02.820 --> 00:46:05.447
She even would
leave me alone with them sometimes.


930
00:46:06.240 --> 00:46:07.991
I saw her pulling out the driveway,

931
00:46:08.075 --> 00:46:10.494
and I ran out there, I was like,
"Grandma, what are you doing?"


932
00:46:10.577 --> 00:46:11.995
"There's an adult in there."

933
00:46:13.497 --> 00:46:16.250
She was like, "Yeah, he'll watch you.
I'll be right back."


934
00:46:16.333 --> 00:46:18.335
[audience laughing]

935
00:46:21.171 --> 00:46:23.048
Sometimes I'd mess up on these haircuts,

936
00:46:23.131 --> 00:46:25.968
and I would have these grown-ass men
just screaming at me


937
00:46:26.051 --> 00:46:27.719
in my little 13-year-old bedroom.

938
00:46:28.220 --> 00:46:30.556
As soon as I'd give them the mirror.
"Hey, let me see."


939
00:46:31.056 --> 00:46:34.101
"Goddamn. What the fuck, dumbass?"

940
00:46:34.184 --> 00:46:37.646
Like, "You don't know what you're doing.
You don't know how to cut no hair."


941
00:46:37.729 --> 00:46:39.898
But I would always tell them
the same thing.


942
00:46:40.649 --> 00:46:43.068
"I'm 13. Why would
you let me do this?"

943
00:46:43.151 --> 00:46:46.947
[audience laughing and applauding]

944
00:46:47.656 --> 00:46:51.326
[cheering]

945
00:46:52.703 --> 00:46:54.162
And then I'd go off on them.

946
00:46:54.246 --> 00:46:55.747
[audience laughing]

947
00:46:55.831 --> 00:46:57.833
I'm like, "You walked into a room

948
00:46:58.333 --> 00:47:00.752
covered in <i>Dragon Ball Z</i> posters..."

949
00:47:00.836 --> 00:47:02.838
[audience laughing]

950
00:47:03.797 --> 00:47:06.133
"...and you really expected a quality cut

951
00:47:07.092 --> 00:47:10.345
from a dude who's never even
seen titties in real life."


952
00:47:10.429 --> 00:47:12.598
[audience laughing]

953
00:47:12.681 --> 00:47:15.267
I said, "No, sir.
<i>You</i> don't know what you're doing."


954
00:47:15.350 --> 00:47:16.643
[audience laughing]

955
00:47:16.727 --> 00:47:18.979
"Grandma, escort this gentleman
out the door."


956
00:47:19.062 --> 00:47:21.273
[raucous laughter and applause]

957
00:47:21.356 --> 00:47:25.110
[cheering]

958
00:47:28.864 --> 00:47:29.865
But yeah, man.

959
00:47:29.948 --> 00:47:32.326
[audience chuckling]

960
00:47:33.452 --> 00:47:36.455
I love... I love being able
to travel now, you know?


961
00:47:36.538 --> 00:47:38.123
It's opened my mind
to a lot of things.

962
00:47:38.206 --> 00:47:40.542
I didn't realize this,
but I take some things for granted


963
00:47:40.626 --> 00:47:43.378
that people in other places,
they'd appreciate more.


964
00:47:43.462 --> 00:47:44.671
And vice versa.

965
00:47:44.755 --> 00:47:47.466
I was in Canada awhile back,
and I was talking to this girl.


966
00:47:47.549 --> 00:47:50.761
I said, "It's so cool how in Canada,
you guys have legal weed


967
00:47:50.844 --> 00:47:52.095
across the nation."

968
00:47:52.846 --> 00:47:56.350
And she was like, "You don't know
what the fuck you're talking about."


969
00:47:57.142 --> 00:47:59.311
I was like, "Oh
my God. I... I don't."

970
00:47:59.394 --> 00:48:01.396
[audience laughing]

971
00:48:01.939 --> 00:48:03.440
She said, "Where are you from?"

972
00:48:03.523 --> 00:48:05.108
I said, "Well, 
I'm from Texas."

973
00:48:05.192 --> 00:48:07.903
She was like, "You see? In Canada,
we need to be more like Texas,


974
00:48:07.986 --> 00:48:10.656
'cause y'all have guns.
We need guns. I need a gun."


975
00:48:12.157 --> 00:48:14.076
I was like, "I think you'll be aight."

976
00:48:14.159 --> 00:48:16.453
[audience laughing]

977
00:48:16.536 --> 00:48:18.705
"I think you just need
somebody to talk to."


978
00:48:18.789 --> 00:48:20.290
[audience laughing]

979
00:48:21.083 --> 00:48:22.751
She was like, "You don't get it."

980
00:48:22.834 --> 00:48:25.170
"We don't all...
we don't all want legal weed


981
00:48:25.253 --> 00:48:28.465
'cause what a lot of people don't see
is when Canada legalized weed,


982
00:48:28.548 --> 00:48:29.967
it came with a lot of bullshit."

983
00:48:30.050 --> 00:48:31.677
"It gave the police more power."

984
00:48:31.760 --> 00:48:34.930
"Now they can pull you over,
search you for no real reason at all,


985
00:48:35.013 --> 00:48:38.350
they treat you bad. There's been
an increase in police brutality cases."


986
00:48:38.433 --> 00:48:40.185
And she's going on and on,

987
00:48:40.268 --> 00:48:43.438
and I don't know if that stuff is true,
but even if it is, like...


988
00:48:44.940 --> 00:48:48.735
Unfair treatment
as a tradeoff for legal weed?


989
00:48:50.070 --> 00:48:50.946
I'd take it.

990
00:48:51.029 --> 00:48:53.407
[audience laughing]

991
00:48:53.490 --> 00:48:56.243
Eh. I was like, "It sounds to me
like what you're going through,


992
00:48:56.326 --> 00:48:57.577
it don't sound that bad."

993
00:48:57.661 --> 00:48:59.955
It feels like if you grew up
in a household


994
00:49:00.038 --> 00:49:02.290
with, like, very strict,
but polite parents.


995
00:49:02.374 --> 00:49:04.876
They treat you right,
but they don't let you smoke.


996
00:49:04.960 --> 00:49:06.628
And then one day, these parents were like,

997
00:49:06.712 --> 00:49:09.256
"All right,
you can smoke weed in this house,


998
00:49:09.339 --> 00:49:11.925
but also,
we're gonna start hitting you now."


999
00:49:12.009 --> 00:49:14.386
[audience laughing]

1000
00:49:14.469 --> 00:49:17.222
I'd be like, "All right. As long as
I'm high when you're hitting me."


1001
00:49:17.305 --> 00:49:19.141
[audience laughing]

1002
00:49:19.224 --> 00:49:21.226
We'll literally go. 
A hit for a hit.

1003
00:49:21.309 --> 00:49:23.895
[audience laughing and applauding]

1004
00:49:28.692 --> 00:49:30.110
I didn't even realize...

1005
00:49:30.694 --> 00:49:34.823
like, I'm born and raised here in Texas,
but I didn't realize how accustomed to it,


1006
00:49:34.906 --> 00:49:38.410
how Texas I really was on the inside,
until I got to travel.


1007
00:49:38.493 --> 00:49:41.913
I remember the first time
I stayed in New York for a few weeks.


1008
00:49:42.456 --> 00:49:44.875
I was like 20, maybe,
and my buddy was pointing out to me,


1009
00:49:44.958 --> 00:49:48.378
he's like, "Hey, man,
have you noticed how over here,


1010
00:49:48.462 --> 00:49:50.172
nobody can walk around with guns?"

1011
00:49:50.255 --> 00:49:54.051
He's like, "The police can have guns.
We can't have guns, only the police can."


1012
00:49:54.551 --> 00:49:56.053
I was like, "Dang, for real."

1013
00:49:59.639 --> 00:50:01.016
"Am I Republican?"

1014
00:50:01.099 --> 00:50:03.101
[audience laughing]

1015
00:50:05.312 --> 00:50:07.773
Don't take that too serious.
These are just jokes.


1016
00:50:07.856 --> 00:50:09.858
[audience laughing]

1017
00:50:10.901 --> 00:50:14.237
It just threw me off is all,
'cause I'm not... I'm not used to that.


1018
00:50:14.321 --> 00:50:17.032
I mean, don't get me wrong. I'm used to,
yeah, the police walk around,


1019
00:50:17.115 --> 00:50:19.034
they have their gun at the holster.

1020
00:50:19.117 --> 00:50:21.787
Sometimes they might even
eyeball you a little bit.


1021
00:50:23.205 --> 00:50:26.541
Like as if to say,
"Hey, don't... don't start nothin' now."


1022
00:50:27.793 --> 00:50:29.961
And that's fine.
I'm used to that, you know.


1023
00:50:30.045 --> 00:50:33.381
I'm just also very used
to the way it is back home...


1024
00:50:33.465 --> 00:50:34.299
[woman whoops]

1025
00:50:34.382 --> 00:50:37.052
...where you can also walk around
with a gun at the holster.


1026
00:50:37.886 --> 00:50:39.471
And if you're feeling up to it,

1027
00:50:39.554 --> 00:50:41.890
you could eyeball the police back
a little bit.


1028
00:50:41.973 --> 00:50:44.643
[audience laughing and applauding]

1029
00:50:44.726 --> 00:50:47.354
[audience cheering]

1030
00:50:49.439 --> 00:50:51.441
You'd be like, "Hey, you neither, now."

1031
00:50:51.525 --> 00:50:53.151
[audience laughing]

1032
00:50:53.235 --> 00:50:55.112
I remember they used
to teach us that in school.


1033
00:50:55.195 --> 00:50:56.822
It's called checks and balances.

1034
00:50:56.905 --> 00:50:58.907
[audience laughing]

1035
00:51:00.659 --> 00:51:01.493
Um...

1036
00:51:02.119 --> 00:51:04.663
I went to Canada,
asked them about their gun laws.


1037
00:51:04.746 --> 00:51:06.373
Asked a few different people.

1038
00:51:06.456 --> 00:51:08.583
From what I can tell, in Canada,

1039
00:51:08.667 --> 00:51:11.128
it's, like, extremely difficult
to get a gun,


1040
00:51:11.211 --> 00:51:14.131
but if you can get one,
you can only keep it at your house,


1041
00:51:14.214 --> 00:51:17.717
which... I guess that sucks,
'cause what if you have enemies to kill?


1042
00:51:17.801 --> 00:51:19.177
[audience laughing]

1043
00:51:19.261 --> 00:51:21.471
What do you do then?
You have to invite them over?


1044
00:51:21.555 --> 00:51:23.265
[audience laughing]

1045
00:51:23.348 --> 00:51:26.434
I was like, "Yo, this is why
you Canadians get that stereotype


1046
00:51:26.518 --> 00:51:29.646
that you're all polite, man,
'cause somebody does you dirty,


1047
00:51:29.729 --> 00:51:31.982
you're like,
"What? You slept with my wife?"


1048
00:51:33.441 --> 00:51:35.068
"Come over for dinner tonight."

1049
00:51:35.152 --> 00:51:37.154
[audience laughing]

1050
00:51:42.117 --> 00:51:44.953
Also, I just wanna say this
to be 100% clear.


1051
00:51:45.036 --> 00:51:47.247
Like, I... Like, I feel
like I have to say it.


1052
00:51:47.998 --> 00:51:49.457
I'm not really Republican.

1053
00:51:49.541 --> 00:51:52.210
- [audience laughing and cheering]
- Yeah.


1054
00:51:52.294 --> 00:51:54.504
- No, no, no.
- [cheering continues]


1055
00:51:54.588 --> 00:51:55.589
Don't...

1056
00:51:56.173 --> 00:51:58.049
Don't clap. I'm not you either.

1057
00:51:58.133 --> 00:52:00.135
[audience laughing]

1058
00:52:00.844 --> 00:52:02.679
I've just never voted. I just...

1059
00:52:02.762 --> 00:52:04.222
[audience laughing]

1060
00:52:04.306 --> 00:52:06.474
Yeah, man.
Most people don't care, you know,


1061
00:52:06.558 --> 00:52:09.436
but I-I have made some...
some friends along the way,


1062
00:52:09.519 --> 00:52:11.813
some more liberal-type friends
that stop being my friends


1063
00:52:11.897 --> 00:52:13.690
when they find out I don't vote.

1064
00:52:13.773 --> 00:52:17.194
It was... it was in Brooklyn, New York,
dude got in my face about it.


1065
00:52:17.277 --> 00:52:19.529
He was like, "You don't... you don't vote?"

1066
00:52:20.780 --> 00:52:22.282
"What, you don't give a fuck?"

1067
00:52:22.365 --> 00:52:23.783
[audience laughing]

1068
00:52:23.867 --> 00:52:26.286
I'm like,
"Yo, man, that's not cool. I care."


1069
00:52:26.369 --> 00:52:28.371
"Well, not really, but that's not cool."

1070
00:52:29.331 --> 00:52:32.834
I don't like the way he did that.
I felt like he was judging me a little.


1071
00:52:32.918 --> 00:52:34.085
I don't know how he grew up.

1072
00:52:34.169 --> 00:52:36.338
Maybe, you know,
maybe he had some political literacy.


1073
00:52:36.421 --> 00:52:38.173
But I don't. Nobody taught me about that.

1074
00:52:38.256 --> 00:52:41.009
I was raised by my grandma.
She had just got to this country.


1075
00:52:41.092 --> 00:52:44.179
She's not gonna encourage me to vote.
She was just like, "Don't touch nothin'..."


1076
00:52:44.262 --> 00:52:45.805
[audience laughing]

1077
00:52:46.473 --> 00:52:48.141
"Let's just be happy to be here."

1078
00:52:50.393 --> 00:52:51.394
My mom, you know...

1079
00:52:51.478 --> 00:52:53.021
My mom had me at 16.

1080
00:52:53.104 --> 00:52:55.357
You think she's gonna
teach me about politics?


1081
00:52:55.440 --> 00:52:57.692
I watched that kid grow up
before my own eyes.


1082
00:52:57.776 --> 00:52:59.778
[audience laughing]

1083
00:53:01.655 --> 00:53:03.198
- Yeah.
- [cheering]


1084
00:53:05.158 --> 00:53:08.536
My dad was the only one who
knew about laws or the judicial system,


1085
00:53:08.620 --> 00:53:10.538
but that's 'cause he was an astronaut.

1086
00:53:10.622 --> 00:53:12.624
[audience laughing]

1087
00:53:17.045 --> 00:53:18.880
Yeah. I mean, I'll vote eventually.

1088
00:53:18.964 --> 00:53:22.050
I'm not like, "Yo, I'll never vote."
No, I'll vote eventually.


1089
00:53:22.133 --> 00:53:25.720
And I also don't judge
anybody's political preferences.


1090
00:53:25.804 --> 00:53:27.472
If you're left, right, red, blue.

1091
00:53:27.555 --> 00:53:30.183
I don't care if you like immigrants,
if you hate immigrants.


1092
00:53:30.267 --> 00:53:32.143
Just leave my girl out of it, please.

1093
00:53:32.227 --> 00:53:34.020
[audience laughing]

1094
00:53:35.897 --> 00:53:38.233
I don't judge, man.
I get along with everybody.


1095
00:53:39.484 --> 00:53:42.362
Well, there's, like, one group of people,
one small group,


1096
00:53:42.445 --> 00:53:44.906
that I... that I
do judge a little bit.

1097
00:53:45.699 --> 00:53:49.577
And I'm not even saying they're wrong.
I just... I just judge them a little bit.


1098
00:53:50.412 --> 00:53:52.747
And it is Latino Republicans.

1099
00:53:52.831 --> 00:53:55.125
[audience chuckling]

1100
00:53:55.208 --> 00:53:57.377
- Yeah.
- [audience cheering and applauding]


1101
00:53:59.254 --> 00:54:00.088
Yeah.

1102
00:54:01.256 --> 00:54:03.633
I mean, more power to you,
but you look weird.


1103
00:54:03.717 --> 00:54:05.093
[audience laughing]

1104
00:54:05.176 --> 00:54:07.971
Even white Republicans
look at you like, "Huh?"


1105
00:54:08.054 --> 00:54:10.056
[audience laughing]

1106
00:54:10.598 --> 00:54:13.351
It's just weird to see some brown dude
say something off the wall,


1107
00:54:13.435 --> 00:54:15.979
like... [in heavy accent]
"Hey, we gotta stop immigrants."


1108
00:54:16.062 --> 00:54:17.731
[audience laughing]

1109
00:54:19.441 --> 00:54:21.192
[in normal voice]
Like, "When'd you get here?"


1110
00:54:21.276 --> 00:54:23.278
[audience laughing]

1111
00:54:24.946 --> 00:54:27.073
But yeah. But to
each their own, you know?

1112
00:54:27.157 --> 00:54:30.827
I don't really care too much about it all,
like the laws or anything.


1113
00:54:30.910 --> 00:54:32.912
I don't take them too much... serious.

1114
00:54:33.455 --> 00:54:35.832
I mean, I like...
Being from Texas, I like guns.


1115
00:54:35.915 --> 00:54:38.001
I'm not, like, super into guns, you know.

1116
00:54:38.084 --> 00:54:40.962
My friends are.
They got, like, safes full of guns.


1117
00:54:41.046 --> 00:54:43.715
I did buy a gun
'cause I wanted to fit in.

1118
00:54:43.798 --> 00:54:45.175
[audience laughing]

1119
00:54:45.258 --> 00:54:47.635
But I didn't buy bullets.
Those are dangerous.


1120
00:54:47.719 --> 00:54:49.721
[audience laughing]

1121
00:54:53.099 --> 00:54:55.977
I... I just got the gun
so I can bond with my boys, you know?


1122
00:54:56.061 --> 00:54:57.896
We do activities together.

1123
00:54:57.979 --> 00:55:00.440
Like, we go to the shooting range together
all the time.


1124
00:55:00.940 --> 00:55:02.817
I don't buy bullets there either, though.

1125
00:55:03.318 --> 00:55:05.945
I just get my gun,
I go in my booth, and I make noises.


1126
00:55:06.029 --> 00:55:07.947
I be like, "Blam, blam, blam!"

1127
00:55:08.031 --> 00:55:10.033
[audience laughing]

1128
00:55:13.953 --> 00:55:16.289
My boy was looking at me like,
"What are you doing?"


1129
00:55:17.791 --> 00:55:18.666
But I don't care.

1130
00:55:18.750 --> 00:55:21.002
I just look back at him like,
"Shut the fuck..."


1131
00:55:21.086 --> 00:55:22.420
[audience laughing]

1132
00:55:30.637 --> 00:55:33.348
[audience chuckling]

1133
00:55:34.224 --> 00:55:36.976
Guns make watching TV
with, like, your family funner.


1134
00:55:37.811 --> 00:55:40.105
I just be sitting there
looking at everybody...


1135
00:55:42.565 --> 00:55:44.484
[imitates gun cocking]
"Who has the remote?"


1136
00:55:44.567 --> 00:55:46.569
[audience laughing]

1137
00:55:48.488 --> 00:55:50.657
When you don't buy bullets,
you technically have access


1138
00:55:50.740 --> 00:55:52.409
to any kind of bullets you'd ever want.

1139
00:55:52.492 --> 00:55:54.285
It's all up to your imagination.

1140
00:55:54.994 --> 00:55:57.747
Some days I'm in the range,
and I'm like, "Blam, blam!"


1141
00:55:59.791 --> 00:56:02.085
I saw those <i>Star Wars</i> movies on TNT

1142
00:56:02.168 --> 00:56:04.421
and I was in there like...
[mimics laser gun firing]


1143
00:56:04.504 --> 00:56:06.506
[audience laughing]

1144
00:56:12.095 --> 00:56:14.556
Shit. My girl just put me on
to those Harry Potter movies.


1145
00:56:14.639 --> 00:56:16.474
I was in there like... [chanting]

1146
00:56:16.558 --> 00:56:18.560
[audience laughing]

1147
00:56:25.108 --> 00:56:27.193
Yeah, my friends don't like that, though.

1148
00:56:27.735 --> 00:56:30.071
They're like,
"Why do you come to the gun range


1149
00:56:30.613 --> 00:56:32.157
if you're just gonna pretend?"

1150
00:56:33.783 --> 00:56:34.951
I said, "Pretend?"

1151
00:56:36.035 --> 00:56:39.456
I'm like, "Bro, you bought bullets
and a piece of paper to shoot at."


1152
00:56:40.999 --> 00:56:43.501
"You just paid money
to pretend harder than I do."


1153
00:56:43.585 --> 00:56:46.671
[audience laughing and applauding]

1154
00:56:49.090 --> 00:56:52.510
Like, "If anything, you're wasting money,
'cause sometimes you miss."


1155
00:56:52.594 --> 00:56:54.345
[audience laughing]

1156
00:56:54.429 --> 00:56:55.722
"I never miss."

1157
00:56:55.805 --> 00:56:59.267
[audience cheering and applauding]

1158
00:57:01.269 --> 00:57:04.063
I'll be in my booth like,
"Head shot. Again."


1159
00:57:04.147 --> 00:57:06.107
[audience laughing]

1160
00:57:06.191 --> 00:57:07.108
[cheering]

1161
00:57:11.404 --> 00:57:13.781
And one of my boys
got all in my face about it, man.


1162
00:57:13.865 --> 00:57:15.575
He takes guns very serious,
which you should.


1163
00:57:15.658 --> 00:57:17.410
You should take a gun very serious.

1164
00:57:17.494 --> 00:57:19.662
I mean, I don't.
It's all a joke to me, but...


1165
00:57:19.746 --> 00:57:21.247
[audience laughing]

1166
00:57:21.331 --> 00:57:23.082
He was like,
"Man, if you're gonna have a gun,


1167
00:57:23.166 --> 00:57:25.376
you always need to carry bullets, man."

1168
00:57:25.460 --> 00:57:27.587
"It's not a toy.
It's not something to play with."


1169
00:57:27.670 --> 00:57:30.965
He said, "God forbid, one day your life
could come into some real danger,


1170
00:57:31.049 --> 00:57:34.677
and if that day ever comes, you'll wish
you had bullets to protect yourself."


1171
00:57:35.178 --> 00:57:36.930
And that's probably true, you know?

1172
00:57:37.013 --> 00:57:38.264
He's most likely right.

1173
00:57:38.765 --> 00:57:40.558
But... I don't know, man.

1174
00:57:40.642 --> 00:57:44.062
Like... I don't think I'd have the heart
to actually shoot somebody.


1175
00:57:44.145 --> 00:57:45.772
But if my life was really in danger,

1176
00:57:45.855 --> 00:57:48.066
I don't need the bullets
to protect myself.


1177
00:57:48.149 --> 00:57:50.777
I just need the gun itself
to scare people off,


1178
00:57:50.860 --> 00:57:52.487
make 'em think I'm crazy.

1179
00:57:52.570 --> 00:57:55.365
You know? Somebody'll run up on me
like, "Give me your money!"


1180
00:57:55.448 --> 00:57:56.866
I'll be like... 
[imitates gun cocking]

1181
00:57:56.950 --> 00:57:59.744
"I don't fucking need this right now, man,
I swear to God!"


1182
00:57:59.827 --> 00:58:02.121
[raucous laughter]

1183
00:58:02.205 --> 00:58:03.748
[yelling]

1184
00:58:03.831 --> 00:58:05.833
[audience laughing and applauding]

1185
00:58:11.089 --> 00:58:13.883
[cheering]

1186
00:58:17.303 --> 00:58:20.181
He'll be like, "Keep your money
and your dick, man. I'm sorry."


1187
00:58:20.265 --> 00:58:22.267
[raucous laughter]

1188
00:58:27.480 --> 00:58:29.607
Yeah. Guns are cool, man. 
Bullets are bad.

1189
00:58:29.691 --> 00:58:31.693
[audience laughing]

1190
00:58:34.195 --> 00:58:36.239
I don't know.
I'm trying not to be insensitive,


1191
00:58:36.322 --> 00:58:39.200
but I don't think I'm that much
of a sensitive dude in the first place.


1192
00:58:39.284 --> 00:58:41.828
Like, I don't even mind getting profiled...

1193
00:58:41.911 --> 00:58:42.829
correctly.

1194
00:58:42.912 --> 00:58:44.497
[scattered chuckles]

1195
00:58:44.581 --> 00:58:47.458
Yeah. When they get it wrong,
it can be hurtful, you know?


1196
00:58:47.959 --> 00:58:49.711
Like if somebody
was to come up to me like,


1197
00:58:49.794 --> 00:58:53.590
"Look at this construction worker,
lawnmower," you know?


1198
00:58:53.673 --> 00:58:56.301
I'd be like, "Damn, that's messed up.
I don't even work hard."


1199
00:58:56.384 --> 00:58:57.844
[audience laughing]

1200
00:58:59.262 --> 00:59:01.889
But if somebody came up to me
and was like, "Yo...


1201
00:59:02.682 --> 00:59:04.684
look at this bean-eating..."

1202
00:59:04.767 --> 00:59:05.893
[audience tittering]

1203
00:59:05.977 --> 00:59:07.854
"...Hot Cheeto-loving..."

1204
00:59:07.937 --> 00:59:09.105
[audience laughing]

1205
00:59:10.189 --> 00:59:13.234
"...dish-washing, <i>Dragon Ball-</i>watching..."

1206
00:59:14.694 --> 00:59:16.279
I'd be like, "Damn, he's good."

1207
00:59:16.362 --> 00:59:17.864
[raucous laughter]

1208
00:59:22.368 --> 00:59:23.328
I don't know. I...

1209
00:59:23.828 --> 00:59:27.749
I also... I learned the pros and cons
of racially profiling people


1210
00:59:27.832 --> 00:59:29.292
at a young age.

1211
00:59:29.375 --> 00:59:33.713
Like, when I was 13, me and my buddy Jaime
went walking to a 7-Eleven gas station


1212
00:59:33.796 --> 00:59:36.132
to get some ice cream.
It was summer. It was hot.


1213
00:59:36.215 --> 00:59:37.800
And when we got to the freezer,

1214
00:59:37.884 --> 00:59:40.136
I remember there was this
orange push pop I wanted to get.


1215
00:59:40.219 --> 00:59:42.305
You remember those?
You'd push it from the bottom?


1216
00:59:42.388 --> 00:59:45.058
It's, like, in this weird
Downy toilet paper roll-looking...


1217
00:59:45.141 --> 00:59:47.310
[audience laughing]

1218
00:59:47.393 --> 00:59:48.311
It was good.

1219
00:59:49.103 --> 00:59:51.564
And I remember it so vividly.
It was the last one.


1220
00:59:51.648 --> 00:59:54.442
I was about to grab it, but my buddy Jaime
and his long-ass fingers


1221
00:59:54.525 --> 00:59:56.152
just got to it before I could.

1222
00:59:57.695 --> 00:59:59.155
But right when he gripped it,

1223
00:59:59.238 --> 01:00:01.908
and I'll never forget
the sound of this man's voice,


1224
01:00:01.991 --> 01:00:04.160
and the fear that his voice
put in my heart,


1225
01:00:04.243 --> 01:00:05.870
'cause he wanted us to hear him.

1226
01:00:06.537 --> 01:00:09.499
This man, this cashier,
he said to the woman cashier,


1227
01:00:09.582 --> 01:00:11.084
he goes, "Watch this, Brenda."

1228
01:00:11.167 --> 01:00:13.002
"That motherfucker's
gonna grab that ice cream


1229
01:00:13.086 --> 01:00:15.338
and put it right in his fucking pocket."

1230
01:00:15.421 --> 01:00:18.633
And I knew he was talking about us,
and I got scared. I froze.


1231
01:00:18.716 --> 01:00:20.843
And my buddy Jaime
let go of the ice cream,


1232
01:00:20.927 --> 01:00:22.679
and he stood up for himself.

1233
01:00:22.762 --> 01:00:24.931
Which was wild. 
We were shy kids, man.

1234
01:00:25.014 --> 01:00:27.517
We never stood up
to people our own age, you know?


1235
01:00:27.600 --> 01:00:30.395
We used to get bullied,
we'd take the ass-whoopin' and move on.


1236
01:00:30.478 --> 01:00:32.105
[audience laughing]

1237
01:00:32.188 --> 01:00:36.401
But Jaime was mad. He was offended
that somebody accused him of stealing.


1238
01:00:36.484 --> 01:00:38.653
'Cause he was a hard-working kid.
He earned his money.


1239
01:00:38.736 --> 01:00:40.738
He was the 11-year-old that was my...

1240
01:00:44.617 --> 01:00:46.369
We used to wash dishes together.

1241
01:00:50.164 --> 01:00:51.999
Anyway, he stood up for himself.

1242
01:00:52.083 --> 01:00:53.626
He looked at that cashier,

1243
01:00:53.710 --> 01:00:57.004
he said, "Excuse, me, sir,
are you profiling me right now?"


1244
01:00:57.588 --> 01:00:59.841
And the cashier was like,
"You call it what you want, man."


1245
01:00:59.924 --> 01:01:02.885
He's like, "Little fuckers like you
come in and steal shit all the time."


1246
01:01:02.969 --> 01:01:04.804
He's like, "I don't
need you in my store."

1247
01:01:04.887 --> 01:01:08.641
Jaime was mad. He's like, "You don't...
you don't know who I am or how I am."


1248
01:01:08.725 --> 01:01:10.476
He's like,
"We've never stolen from you, man."


1249
01:01:10.560 --> 01:01:12.812
"We come in here all the time
and buy snacks."


1250
01:01:12.895 --> 01:01:15.314
And I was just
like, "Yo, don't say 'we.'"

1251
01:01:15.398 --> 01:01:18.025
[audience laughing]

1252
01:01:21.571 --> 01:01:23.948
He's like, "You don't have any right
to talk to us like that."


1253
01:01:24.031 --> 01:01:26.033
He's like, "You may not know this
from looking at me,


1254
01:01:26.117 --> 01:01:28.536
but I'm a hard-working kid.
I earn my money."


1255
01:01:28.619 --> 01:01:30.788
He's like, "We come in here,
we buy snacks all the time."


1256
01:01:30.872 --> 01:01:33.124
"Never once have we stolen, man.
I don't have to steal."


1257
01:01:33.207 --> 01:01:36.461
"I take a lot of pride in the fact that
I work for the money to buy these snacks


1258
01:01:36.544 --> 01:01:37.879
whenever I want them."

1259
01:01:37.962 --> 01:01:40.381
And all the adults in the store
start listening to the story,


1260
01:01:40.465 --> 01:01:42.133
and they start cheering on Jaime.

1261
01:01:42.216 --> 01:01:45.011
They're like, "Hell, yeah.
Tell his ass, kid. Tell him."


1262
01:01:45.636 --> 01:01:47.513
So all the attention is on Jaime,

1263
01:01:48.097 --> 01:01:50.558
I grabbed that ice cream,
I put it right in my pocket.

That dude was right to profile.
He just got the wrong one.

Hey, thank you guys so much, man.
