He's not.

50
00:04:01.266 --> 00:04:04.466
It's a little complicated.
They said no.


51
00:04:09.267 --> 00:04:12.965

56
00:04:24.977 --> 00:04:28.142
No, you have to spend, and

57
00:04:28.227 --> 00:04:29.472
Slowly, it's a shock.

58
00:04:31.227 --> 00:04:32.638

108
00:07:55.248 --> 00:07:58.910

is Not a swimming pool, my child.

112
00:08:10.624 --> 00:08:13.824
What was I saying? Here we have
neither a swimming pool nor a tv.


113

Our waste is recycled.

Come on, mom.

154
00:10:17.720 --> 00:10:20.838
Fortunately, your grandmother
is a tough old dog.


155
00:10:23.679 --> 00:10:26.513
Uncle, why did you choose
for a mascot that bird?


156
00:10:26.596 --> 00:10:28.505
Is the κυανόραμφο toucan.

157
00:10:28.596 --> 00:10:31.300
Bird sanctuary. Unfortunately,
it was destroyed years ago.


158
00:10:31.388 --> 00:10:34.636
But it remains our symbol for
the protection of animals.


159
00:10:35.180 --> 00:10:37.716
We grow what we eat. Here
everything is organic.


160
00:10:37.805 --> 00:10:40.591
Organic products, recycling...
good for business, huh?


161
00:10:40.681 --> 00:10:43.431
It's not business,
it's a way of life.


162
00:10:43.556 --> 00:10:47.302
The customers come in contact with
the nature. And I that's why I came.


163
00:10:47.390 --> 00:10:51.515
Then will that man filming us?
Has started to get on my...


164
00:10:52.973 --> 00:10:56.885
Guys, you want to have fun. I
have what you need for that.


165
00:10:56.973 --> 00:10:59.640
See the canoes from
recycled plastic.


166
00:10:59.766 --> 00:11:01.592
Take it and have fun.

167
00:11:01.683 --> 00:11:05.215
I'd love to, but I need to bring
my fiancee from the airport.


168
00:11:06.392 --> 00:11:10.090
- I'm not in the mood for canoeing.
- Impossible!


169
00:11:11.142 --> 00:11:13.548
Do I look like I am not
the type for a canoe?


170
00:11:16.851 --> 00:11:20.467
- a Very bad hotel. Oh, Shit.

171
00:11:20.768 --> 00:11:23.886
- did you get my ring?
- I can't, when I'm not home.


172
00:11:23.977 --> 00:11:26.383
Sam, where are you taking us?

173
00:11:26.768 --> 00:11:30.929
My friends... the real
vacation starts now!


174
00:12:03.897 --> 00:12:04.976
What is this?

175
00:12:09.856 --> 00:12:11.434
Asshole! What a waste of life!

176
00:12:13.607 --> 00:12:15.314
- What are these? 
- Plums.

177
00:12:15.398 --> 00:12:17.189
Why? Shut up and eat!

178
00:12:17.273 --> 00:12:19.146
- to do bad? 
- Yeah!

179
00:12:34.900 --> 00:12:36.394
Damn it!

180
00:12:39.067 --> 00:12:40.525
Incredible!

181
00:12:44.902 --> 00:12:49.939
My heart, pierced all of my
clothes with his harpoon.


182
00:12:51.027 --> 00:12:54.689
Look! Come see! All leaky!

183
00:12:56.277 --> 00:13:00.319
- you find that funny?
- I don't care at all now.


184
00:13:04.612 --> 00:13:07.315
Good evening...
my name is Frank.


185
00:13:12.279 --> 00:13:14.069
Come On, Τζεζόν! 
Get a move on!

186
00:13:17.072 --> 00:13:20.901
Guys, going out for a beer.
Anyone want one?


187
00:13:20.988 --> 00:13:23.229
- No, thank you. 
- Ok.

188
00:13:23.822 --> 00:13:26.394
Did you get it?

189
00:13:26.489 --> 00:13:30.898
Don't worry about it. In Brazil, a man
with a bra does not come as a shock.


190
00:13:35.990 --> 00:13:38.278
- Go right? 
- What's going on?

191
00:13:39.615 --> 00:13:43.562
- What's the matter, sweetheart?
- I threw the ball and laughing.


192
00:13:43.657 --> 00:13:47.901
Why don't you demand an apology? I'll
give it to you, but play further.


193
00:13:47.991 --> 00:13:51.902
mocking Us.
- Throw it away! The bastards!


194
00:13:54.908 --> 00:13:56.189
I'm sorry.

195
00:13:58.992 --> 00:14:01.695
- are You okay? Where did I hit you?
- Here.


196
00:14:02.700 --> 00:14:04.242
I'm sorry. Are you in pain?

197
00:14:05.076 --> 00:14:07.826
You threw the ball to the cacti.

198
00:14:08.034 --> 00:14:10.322
-. 
- You, goldie.

199
00:14:11.035 --> 00:14:15.112
We don't want any trouble on vacation.
- Go get the ball.


200
00:14:15.202 --> 00:14:18.367
It's going well? Learn
ways to your children.


201
00:14:18.452 --> 00:14:20.527
And I'm not talking to the slut.

202
00:14:20.619 --> 00:14:23.286
- Ho I? - do you See
anyone else here?


203
00:14:23.369 --> 00:14:26.036
Frank, do something.
- Okay, I'm going to get the ball.


204
00:14:26.120 --> 00:14:30.743
- No, this one he called me a slut!
- Don't pay attention. He has a temper.


205
00:14:30.829 --> 00:14:33.235
- He has nerves? - let it go.

206
00:14:33.329 --> 00:14:35.202
I can count on you.

207
00:14:35.287 --> 00:14:39.069
- is There a problem?
- This one called me a slut.


208
00:14:40.079 --> 00:14:43.908
- you Said my daughter a slut?
- I didn't know that she is your daughter.


209
00:14:43.997 --> 00:14:48.490
I got mad a little bit. He threw the
ball to my children of the cacti.


210
00:14:49.789 --> 00:14:53.736
You threw the ball of the children?...
Go and get it.


211
00:14:53.831 --> 00:14:58.157
And act like a man. I
won't be here next time.


212
00:14:59.664 --> 00:15:00.992
Thank you, sir.

213
00:15:02.582 --> 00:15:03.578
Come on.

214
00:15:18.959 --> 00:15:21.662
What to do with it?
It is deflated.


215
00:15:29.626 --> 00:15:33.537
- If you wake me up, I'll knock him out.
Wait, to get postcards.


216
00:15:33.626 --> 00:15:37.703
Sonia knows that I don't play
wood and now he's sulking.


217
00:15:37.794 --> 00:15:41.789
- Make a proposal of marriage.
- I Need the ring.


218
00:15:41.877 --> 00:15:43.371
Call flowers.

219
00:15:45.086 --> 00:15:47.836
- I'm Sorry, did I hurt you?
- No problem.


220
00:15:47.919 --> 00:15:49.626
It's not my day.

221
00:15:50.836 --> 00:15:52.543
- Julie. 
- Erica.

222
00:15:52.837 --> 00:15:57.128
- Nice to meet you. Vacation?
Yes, a week of skydiving.


223
00:15:58.046 --> 00:16:01.543
I don't know you! The creator
of the comic "Babysitting"!


224
00:16:01.629 --> 00:16:05.671
- Crazy! I liked it a lot. Well done.
- Thank You.


225
00:16:05.754 --> 00:16:08.706
- Do something together tomorrow?
- Of Course!


226
00:16:09.754 --> 00:16:11.711
No, we can't tomorrow.

227
00:16:17.464 --> 00:16:21.708
Well, we leave you... your
shirt has a hole in it.


228
00:16:23.381 --> 00:16:26.380
A harpoon pierced the bag.

229
00:16:29.132 --> 00:16:33.423
- What are these?
- Make a vacation. It's French.


230
00:16:34.799 --> 00:16:37.466
The key to the room, please.

231
00:16:43.049 --> 00:16:44.627
What were these?

232
00:16:44.717 --> 00:16:48.048
I don't know, but I have
to see you again Erica.


233
00:16:51.009 --> 00:16:54.790
Damn it! Passing tickets out
of my pussy with her hands!


234
00:17:01.009 --> 00:17:04.956
So my finger, I'll break
it down to the wood!


235
00:17:15.011 --> 00:17:17.761
I felt that I was humiliated on
the beach, a little while ago.


236
00:17:17.844 --> 00:17:19.801
Got in the way and my father.

237
00:17:19.887 --> 00:17:23.929
Don't look for it. Frankie
makes at times like a sister.


238
00:17:24.012 --> 00:17:27.130
All men have a gay side.
Look at Alex.


239
00:17:27.221 --> 00:17:30.090
He likes to wear my underwear.

240
00:17:30.763 --> 00:17:32.671
Are you serious?

241
00:17:36.931 --> 00:17:39.799
I hate that I'm in love
with such a cowardly man.


242
00:17:40.389 --> 00:17:44.170
- And I have doubts.
- Seriously? What doubts?


243
00:17:44.264 --> 00:17:48.804
I don't know if I want to live with
a man who would not protect me.


244
00:17:48.889 --> 00:17:51.924
- Tough. 
- If we have kids...

245
00:17:52.306 --> 00:17:54.760
I don't see him as the
father of your children.


246
00:17:54.849 --> 00:17:58.216
I don't know. On the beach,
I stopped to admire him.


247
00:17:58.307 --> 00:18:01.058
Sonya... I want to fart.

248
00:18:02.349 --> 00:18:03.594
Hang in there.

249
00:18:03.683 --> 00:18:08.674
So I touch my pussy, I'll fart!
"Fair trade"!


250
00:18:18.434 --> 00:18:21.054
My friend, I'll cheer you up.

251
00:18:21.143 --> 00:18:23.181
Tomorrow we will go
on a field trip.


252
00:18:23.643 --> 00:18:26.310
- I have no appetite.
- I Signed up for it.


253
00:18:27.643 --> 00:18:29.682
- You want to go outing?
- Of Course.


254
00:18:29.811 --> 00:18:33.142
We must not lose our cultural
heritage of the place.


255
00:18:33.228 --> 00:18:35.894
- And the girls?
- leave it to me.


256
00:18:36.728 --> 00:18:40.308
This is crazy, you see.
I found a treasure map.


257
00:18:40.395 --> 00:18:42.433
The placemats, idiot.

258
00:18:42.520 --> 00:18:44.346
Greetings, gang!

259
00:18:44.770 --> 00:18:47.094
- did You miss me? -.

260
00:18:48.396 --> 00:18:50.850
Sam, there's an awkward
silence between us.


261
00:18:50.938 --> 00:18:54.138
I don't hold it against you
for what you did with my ex.


262
00:18:54.229 --> 00:18:59.563
You opened my eyes. Thanks to you, I
saw that he is a little frivolous.


263
00:18:59.646 --> 00:19:03.344
And I wouldn't have met
my fiancée, Josephine.


264
00:19:03.647 --> 00:19:05.888
- He Came In?
- Yes. Where is it?


265
00:19:06.564 --> 00:19:07.939
There.

266
00:19:14.231 --> 00:19:16.721
A very welcoming
country, Brazil, huh?


267
00:19:16.815 --> 00:19:20.679
What's the program for tomorrow?
- We will go on a field trip.


268
00:19:20.774 --> 00:19:23.726
Let's go to bed. We got
up early in the morning.


269
00:19:24.066 --> 00:19:27.729
- Hello, Ernest. 
- Hi.

270
00:19:29.400 --> 00:19:31.356
Good night.

271
00:19:37.567 --> 00:19:41.313
I'm sorry, gentlemen. Can
I borrow my fiancée?


272
00:19:41.401 --> 00:19:44.685
- No. 
- Okay, no problem.

273
00:20:00.736 --> 00:20:03.060
Leave the talking to me.

274
00:20:03.570 --> 00:20:04.565
There is.

275
00:20:07.153 --> 00:20:10.022
- Girls, what will you do today?
- Beach.


276
00:20:10.112 --> 00:20:12.269
We go on a field trip.
Are you coming?


277
00:20:12.403 --> 00:20:15.486
Trip? Not in the
mood for granny.


278
00:20:15.571 --> 00:20:16.769
No, thank you.

279
00:20:17.030 --> 00:20:18.986
Guys, go to field trip?

280
00:20:19.863 --> 00:20:22.648
Perfect! Mom will love it!

281
00:20:23.738 --> 00:20:25.647
It's not for her age.

282
00:20:25.738 --> 00:20:28.986
I love it, but to my watch.
Is touchy-feely.


283
00:20:29.072 --> 00:20:31.277
- Do You Understand? 
- Yes.

284
00:20:31.406 --> 00:20:36.314
- Ernest, will not come Josephine?
- he Prefers the surf lessons.


285
00:20:37.156 --> 00:20:42.028
- Baby, let's go on a field trip.
- I'll see you later, my love.


286
00:20:43.907 --> 00:20:47.190
- Be careful. - don't
worry, honey.


287
00:20:48.074 --> 00:20:51.157
- Let's Go! - we'll be
back in a couple of hours.


288
00:20:51.241 --> 00:20:53.032
Hello, girls!

289
00:20:54.241 --> 00:20:55.783
Have fun, mom.

290
00:20:55.866 --> 00:20:57.988
Hi, Jean
-Pierre. 
- Hello, uncle.

291
00:20:58.075 --> 00:21:00.031
You trust her, huh?

292
00:21:00.617 --> 00:21:04.446
- How do you let go?
- I'll get an eco-label.


293
00:21:04.533 --> 00:21:06.988
You know your grandmother.
I don't πολυβλέπουν.


294
00:21:07.076 --> 00:21:09.826
It will be a joy with the lads.

295
00:21:10.868 --> 00:21:12.410
And Frank.

296
00:21:13.076 --> 00:21:16.194
I have to go. I have
a phone meeting.


297
00:21:23.578 --> 00:21:24.574
Dad!

298
00:21:26.620 --> 00:21:28.944
- Not found?
- No sign of them in the area.


299
00:21:29.036 --> 00:21:32.652
We need to expand the research.
We'll come with you.


300
00:21:32.912 --> 00:21:33.907
Get.

301
00:22:07.957 --> 00:22:13.078
It no longer has light, he says, and
we need to stop the investigations.


302
00:22:23.125 --> 00:22:26.622
To get. Passed 24 hours
since they left.


303
00:22:27.042 --> 00:22:30.658
- And no new. I'm going to go crazy.
- No news, good news!


304
00:22:30.750 --> 00:22:32.458
What an idiot! Incredible!

305
00:22:33.918 --> 00:22:37.415
- Ask for an apology, you bastard!
- I'm Sorry.


306
00:22:37.585 --> 00:22:42.623
- And we had a fight before they left.
- In your position, I would have felt bad.


307
00:22:44.169 --> 00:22:48.744
All night, I was dreaming about Alex.
We were on our first date.


308
00:22:48.835 --> 00:22:50.910
It was very romantic.

309
00:22:51.295 --> 00:22:56.451
We went to an Italian restaurant,
we ate pasta, we faced each other.


310
00:22:56.587 --> 00:22:59.372
- Like the "Lady and the Tramp".
- And then?


311
00:22:59.629 --> 00:23:01.455
We went home and we fucked.

312
00:23:01.545 --> 00:23:05.492
My love, I had a very important
phone call and I found this.


313
00:23:05.587 --> 00:23:09.001
- The camera of your friend? - been taken.
How did it get there?


314
00:23:09.088 --> 00:23:13.083
- Is the hotel?
- João, check out of the hotel.


315
00:23:13.172 --> 00:23:16.788
- it Is important. It's my mom.
<-S -> Yes, mr. Lamar.


316
00:23:17.589 --> 00:23:20.671
- But what can be happened?
there's only One way to find out.


317
00:23:21.339 --> 00:23:22.749
See the.

318
00:23:23.130 --> 00:23:24.790
here we go again...

319
00:23:26.965 --> 00:23:28.921
It will work like that?

320
00:23:30.215 --> 00:23:31.246
Anything yet?

321
00:23:34.674 --> 00:23:37.507
What stress! The ceremony
starts in 15 minutes!


322
00:23:37.590 --> 00:23:39.333
Dad, nobody gives a shit
about the ceremony.


323
00:23:39.465 --> 00:23:43.460
Of course, that's what I say. Who
gives a shit about the ceremony.


324
00:23:43.550 --> 00:23:46.253
- The linked, Fernando?
Yes, the connection.


325
00:23:46.800 --> 00:23:50.048
Doesn't show anything.
Plug it in, Fernando!


326
00:24:04.844 --> 00:24:06.634
What is this?

327
00:24:08.510 --> 00:24:11.426
<i>Alex, what the hell are you doing?
One time you're in!</i>


328
00:24:11.510 --> 00:24:13.088
<i>I'm Coming, baby!</i>

329
00:24:16.553 --> 00:24:19.303
<i>- we'll be back in a couple of hours.
- Hello, girls!</i>


330
00:24:19.387 --> 00:24:22.800
<i>
- Hey, kids! - have fun, mom!</i>

331
00:24:24.762 --> 00:24:27.086
<i>What our uploaded Jurassic Park?</i>

332
00:24:27.179 --> 00:24:29.799
<i>And the other pretending
to be Indiana Jones!</i>


333
00:24:29.887 --> 00:24:33.087
<i>Why didn't you say no?
- I don't have a choice.</i>


334
00:24:33.305 --> 00:24:37.134
<i>- Hurry, waiting for the bus.
<-S -> What bus?</i>


335
00:24:37.222 --> 00:24:38.846
<i>Sam, what's a bus?</i>

336
00:24:48.972 --> 00:24:51.094
I don't do at your age.

337
00:24:51.640 --> 00:24:55.966
You're breaking my barrs. I'm
old, but I have a right to live!


338
00:24:56.057 --> 00:24:57.599
It relaxes me.

339
00:24:59.599 --> 00:25:02.005
- Nigger, I came, huh?
- Not At All.


340
00:25:02.099 --> 00:25:05.430
- see It, nigger,...
<- S->- a Little.


341
00:25:05.516 --> 00:25:08.965
You're the complete opposite
from the former Sonia.


342
00:25:09.058 --> 00:25:10.173
- Really? 
- Yes.

343
00:25:10.892 --> 00:25:14.934
- He was likeable, and android.
- Perfect.


344
00:25:15.017 --> 00:25:17.507
- do you Want to see a picture of him?
- No, thank you.


345
00:25:17.601 --> 00:25:21.548
- I'll show it to you.
- Photos! Photos!


346
00:25:22.892 --> 00:25:24.801
I always have it with me.

347
00:25:26.144 --> 00:25:29.593
Vacation in the Seychelles.
Handsome, huh?


348
00:25:29.685 --> 00:25:30.681
Yes, it is.

349
00:25:32.019 --> 00:25:34.473
- Go Away! - lighten
up, grandma.


350
00:25:35.602 --> 00:25:38.518
Here we had gone to the concert
of the Snοοp Dοggy Bag.


351
00:25:39.977 --> 00:25:42.467
- Tell me if you're bored.
- Not At All.


352
00:25:42.979 --> 00:25:45.054
I have pictures and Jean
-Pierre.

353
00:25:45.604 --> 00:25:48.935
Look, a nude beach, teen.

354
00:25:49.020 --> 00:25:52.683
- Small Cock!
- I Always had a little bird.


355
00:25:54.312 --> 00:25:57.596
That year, the water
was very cold.


356
00:25:58.313 --> 00:25:59.427
Ice.

357
00:25:59.521 --> 00:26:03.598
- I'm gifted.
- Really? For you to see.


358
00:26:06.064 --> 00:26:09.478
Sam, why are we here?
- scratched.


359
00:26:11.147 --> 00:26:12.771
- Where are we going?
- In the caves.


360
00:26:12.856 --> 00:26:16.353
- a Mess of the plane. - it's a B18.
Recognize it.


361
00:26:17.315 --> 00:26:19.639
Hello. My name is John.

362
00:26:21.690 --> 00:26:23.931
- CNN! Hi! Yes, exactly.

363
00:26:24.899 --> 00:26:29.273
I am your guide and will
accompany you on your trip.


364
00:26:29.982 --> 00:26:33.563
You are more than I expected.

365
00:26:33.941 --> 00:26:35.849
Our load. Is that a problem?

366
00:26:35.942 --> 00:26:38.183
- Hello, gorgeous.
- Hello, ma'am.


367
00:26:38.275 --> 00:26:40.481
No, if you pay.

368
00:26:41.067 --> 00:26:42.644
Hello, girls!

369
00:26:44.234 --> 00:26:46.854
- Son Of A Bitch!
- A Coincidence... Amazing!


370
00:26:48.693 --> 00:26:50.933
- Ready?
- Perfect for coming in.


371
00:26:53.360 --> 00:26:55.436
- Hello, ma'am. 
- Erica.

372
00:26:55.527 --> 00:26:57.649
- The bastards!
- What are these sluts?


373
00:26:57.736 --> 00:26:59.526
They look nice.

374
00:27:01.652 --> 00:27:05.019
I didn't want to say this.
No, not at all sympathetic.


375
00:27:05.111 --> 00:27:08.110
They look vulgar.
And very hackneyed.


376
00:27:08.194 --> 00:27:10.649
- May be... - that's Enough.

377
00:27:11.196 --> 00:27:14.360
Are you kidding me?... What do
we do with them? I'm not going.


378
00:27:14.487 --> 00:27:17.854
I wouldn't miss such an opportunity.
Playing something with Erica.


379
00:27:17.946 --> 00:27:21.395
- As always.
- We're kindred souls.


380
00:27:22.029 --> 00:27:25.526
- is There a problem? No, you
simply won't come to you.


381
00:27:25.613 --> 00:27:29.987
- Γιολάντ, let's go back.
- I Prefer to pay a visit to a cave.


382
00:27:30.072 --> 00:27:33.320
Despite set to be bored stiff at the
hotel with the νερόβραστα foods.


383
00:27:33.406 --> 00:27:37.614
- we can't with a wheelchair.
- The cave has paths.


384
00:27:37.739 --> 00:27:39.897
- Here It Is! 
- Perfect. Go?

385
00:27:40.364 --> 00:27:42.155
- Let's Go! 
- Perfect!

386
00:27:42.823 --> 00:27:43.819
Let's go!

387
00:27:45.032 --> 00:27:48.814
A population, don't get
any ideas with the plane!


388
00:27:48.907 --> 00:27:53.198
I Will have to do with me!
<-S -> What thing?


389
00:27:54.658 --> 00:27:57.858
Is she serious? Okay,
"Master Yoda"!


390
00:28:06.034 --> 00:28:08.606
The altimeter is here in B18!

391
00:28:09.659 --> 00:28:11.651
- I the profession I am.
- Pilot?


392
00:28:11.743 --> 00:28:15.572
Almost. Caregiver...
But I can fly.


393
00:28:16.576 --> 00:28:18.236
Really fly it, Ernest's?

394
00:28:18.326 --> 00:28:22.273
Yeah, lame wrong. I have
over 100 hours of flight.


395
00:28:22.869 --> 00:28:24.612
Ernest knows how to fly!

396
00:28:24.703 --> 00:28:26.445
- Really? 
- Good.

397
00:28:27.744 --> 00:28:29.119
Are you afraid of?

398
00:28:29.494 --> 00:28:31.321
- A Little. - so sweet!

399
00:28:32.036 --> 00:28:34.952
Idiot! Frank is afraid
of airplanes!!!


400
00:28:35.036 --> 00:28:38.983
Who's afraid?... Frank,
don't be afraid at all.


401
00:28:39.204 --> 00:28:42.038
We have parachutes in the back!

402
00:28:42.538 --> 00:28:44.695
Nice, that's a relief.

403
00:28:45.163 --> 00:28:47.829
Relax, you're too uptight.

404
00:28:50.871 --> 00:28:53.870
- Do a good massage.
- it's my job.


405
00:28:54.122 --> 00:28:55.118
Masseuse are you?

406
00:28:55.331 --> 00:28:58.200
You are very cute!
I'll get you a photo!


407
00:28:59.289 --> 00:29:00.913
Come On, Frank.

408
00:29:03.956 --> 00:29:08.366
Perfect! You guys are so cute together!
I'll post the Ιnstagram!


409
00:29:09.040 --> 00:29:11.873
I would Not have it.
- Like Brad Pitt with Angelina.


410
00:29:11.957 --> 00:29:13.333
In the cheap version!

411
00:29:13.749 --> 00:29:16.073
- Till when can you stay?
- I'm leaving tomorrow.


412
00:29:16.166 --> 00:29:20.741
I'm the muse of an Italian brand.
I have a photo shoot in Milan.


413
00:29:21.250 --> 00:29:23.455
I don't have time to get
to know each other.


414
00:29:23.541 --> 00:29:27.583
- Look like Carmen Electra.
- Thank You. For you to George Clooney.


415
00:29:27.666 --> 00:29:29.742
- No. - of course not!

416
00:29:31.793 --> 00:29:35.918
What I hate... The landing!

417
00:29:40.293 --> 00:29:41.787
Perfect!

418
00:29:44.751 --> 00:29:46.909
I don't go to the jungle, right?

419
00:29:47.003 --> 00:29:50.167
No, it's too dangerous.
The cave is there.


420
00:29:50.253 --> 00:29:52.126
He can't bear not in a zoo!

421
00:29:52.211 --> 00:29:53.207
Let's go!

422
00:29:54.378 --> 00:29:56.619
Easy, Γιολάντ. Carefully.

423
00:29:57.920 --> 00:30:00.623
It's hot. We will walk a lot?

424
00:30:01.878 --> 00:30:03.337
That's it!

425
00:30:05.088 --> 00:30:07.375
I changed my battery.

426
00:30:07.588 --> 00:30:10.706
Shit! You can't come with us!

427
00:30:12.005 --> 00:30:13.961
Old woman I am, not crippled.

428
00:30:14.755 --> 00:30:18.086
He has a generator there.
Will the charge.


429
00:30:21.048 --> 00:30:22.874
Does this still work?

430
00:30:23.506 --> 00:30:25.996
- you Have the cable?
- Yes, here it is.


431
00:30:27.048 --> 00:30:29.917
- Perfect! Brand new!
- Plug it in!


432
00:30:33.381 --> 00:30:37.459
What is this?
- Don't be afraid. A sloth.


433
00:30:37.591 --> 00:30:39.250
Completely harmless.

434
00:30:39.924 --> 00:30:44.002
- What a cute little guy!
- so cute!


435
00:30:45.675 --> 00:30:47.417
Look, he's smiling!

436
00:30:48.966 --> 00:30:51.042
He winked at me!

437
00:30:53.175 --> 00:30:54.799
This is it!

438
00:30:56.926 --> 00:31:00.873
- I won't spoil it? No, if
you don't leave this time.


439
00:31:02.051 --> 00:31:06.674
Okay, let's go. Follow me and
stay close to each other.


440
00:31:07.593 --> 00:31:09.715
Hey, you little sloth!

441
00:31:10.135 --> 00:31:14.082
The bat cave! I don't
have bats, I hope.


442
00:31:14.178 --> 00:31:16.750
- Alex, what are you doing?
- I'm Coming.


443
00:31:19.761 --> 00:31:21.469
- Nice... 
- Very nice!

444
00:31:23.345 --> 00:31:25.301
- I saw you! What did I do?

445
00:31:25.803 --> 00:31:28.802
We are located in the most
beautiful room of the cave.


446
00:31:29.721 --> 00:31:33.218
See the stalactites
and the stalagmites.


447
00:31:33.471 --> 00:31:37.253
Admire the designs of
the Neolithic Period.


448
00:31:37.805 --> 00:31:43.044
The Indians used to paint scenes
of everyday life, traditions.


449
00:31:43.680 --> 00:31:47.722
- The childhood friends, Γιολάντ it?
- you Got a problem?


450
00:31:47.806 --> 00:31:50.556
Strange that plan.

451
00:31:51.140 --> 00:31:53.890
This is the legend
of the Τσατσαούμ.


452
00:31:53.973 --> 00:31:56.972
This is the wife of the
head of the tribe.


453
00:31:57.057 --> 00:32:00.838
In accordance with the legend of the
Τσατσαούμ, as a sign of hospitality...


454
00:32:00.932 --> 00:32:04.050
...the leaders offered
the woman the guests...


455
00:32:04.141 --> 00:32:06.216
...I had to lie down with her.

456
00:32:06.516 --> 00:32:07.631
Awesome!

457
00:32:07.725 --> 00:32:11.554
We pass in the other room
that is closed to the public.


458
00:32:11.642 --> 00:32:14.557
- The Indians left it, too?
- No, it's nothing.


459
00:32:14.642 --> 00:32:19.300
German cavers, 40, were
caught by the rain.


460
00:32:19.600 --> 00:32:21.805
- Seriously? 
- Drowned.

461
00:32:21.976 --> 00:32:24.810
- Krauts was. I don't mind.
- Out of the rain?


462
00:32:24.893 --> 00:32:30.180
It has heavy rains in the area.
Flooded cave in a minute.


463
00:32:30.268 --> 00:32:32.307
Very dangerous. What
are we doing here?


464
00:32:32.935 --> 00:32:38.305
Frank, calm down. It never
rains this time of year.


465
00:32:39.395 --> 00:32:43.804
Stay close to me, though.
It's a real maze.


466
00:32:44.395 --> 00:32:48.093
Carefully... it's

467
00:32:48.770 --> 00:32:53.843
The first time I came, I got lost.
It took them a week to find me.


468
00:32:53.937 --> 00:32:56.889
- A week! When did this happen?
- last week.


469
00:32:56.980 --> 00:32:59.434
- Perfect! What?

470
00:33:00.272 --> 00:33:02.891
I'm just kidding.
Don't be afraid.


471
00:33:03.897 --> 00:33:08.306
I have a light, a compass, a GPS...
and flare!


472
00:33:08.397 --> 00:33:12.723
As long as I'm with you,
nothing will happen. I know...


473
00:33:14.940 --> 00:33:16.482
Damn it!

474
00:33:16.565 --> 00:33:18.936
- We make a prank?
- Where did he go?


475
00:33:19.023 --> 00:33:23.267
- we Need to find him. - it Is
very deep, I can't see the bottom.


476
00:33:23.357 --> 00:33:27.103
- Wait, I have an idea!
- What's the idea?


477
00:33:27.190 --> 00:33:30.604
- you'll see, trust me.
- are you Kidding? Look.


478
00:33:30.690 --> 00:33:33.262
I knew we shouldn't have come.

479
00:33:34.025 --> 00:33:36.894
That's the only way we'll
know if it's deep.


480
00:33:37.608 --> 00:33:38.853
I'm fine.

481
00:33:41.817 --> 00:33:42.848
I can't believe it!

482
00:33:42.942 --> 00:33:46.225
- shit, it has no bottom, man!
- Why don't you take a rock?


483
00:33:46.317 --> 00:33:50.561
- Now he's dead for sure! - we
Need to get down quickly.


484
00:33:50.693 --> 00:33:53.443
When I was a kid
and I ran away...


485
00:33:53.527 --> 00:33:57.438
...I was making a rope with
my clothes and it worked.


486
00:33:57.527 --> 00:34:01.474
What? - go on, take your
clothes off, girls.


487
00:34:01.569 --> 00:34:03.774
- Ok. 
- Not you, Γιολάντ.

488
00:34:06.320 --> 00:34:09.485
Take off all your clothes,
because it is very deep.


489
00:34:09.570 --> 00:34:12.605
- I don't have to come.
- All of the clothes. Well done.


490
00:34:12.695 --> 00:34:14.936
Help, if you can't.

491
00:34:15.779 --> 00:34:19.027
- I can help you. - get
your hands off me!


492
00:34:19.404 --> 00:34:21.111
What a big fat rump!

493
00:34:21.862 --> 00:34:25.110
<i>- John, here we are!
- Alex, your shorts.</i>


494
00:34:25.197 --> 00:34:28.859
- I Prefer to wear it.
- Alex, we need all the clothes.


495
00:34:28.947 --> 00:34:32.479
- No, you don't need.
- Give me your shorts!


496
00:34:36.364 --> 00:34:37.988
Damn it! Seriously?

497
00:34:40.407 --> 00:34:43.110
- Very nice thong!
- Put it back.


498
00:34:43.948 --> 00:34:45.572
Now it is torn.

499
00:34:45.657 --> 00:34:48.407
Put this on. Enough
horror I saw in the war.


500
00:34:48.532 --> 00:34:49.907
Perfect!

501
00:34:56.782 --> 00:34:58.940
- Do You Hear, John?
- No answer.


502
00:35:00.908 --> 00:35:01.904
Here we come!

503
00:35:09.409 --> 00:35:12.823
Actually, I had to tie...

504
00:35:13.534 --> 00:35:15.822
Otherwise, it falls...

505
00:35:16.118 --> 00:35:19.568
it seems kind of stupid.
- Go to the plane.


506
00:35:20.160 --> 00:35:24.618
Didn't you hear the tour guide? It's
a maze, you won't find the exit!


507
00:35:24.702 --> 00:35:26.694
You will find it! We
don't have a choice!


508
00:35:26.786 --> 00:35:30.484
- See, he threw the flare.
- Good.


509
00:35:31.119 --> 00:35:32.743
Here we come!

510
00:35:33.245 --> 00:35:34.656
From here, all right?

511
00:35:35.579 --> 00:35:37.570
John, still! Go
to call for help!


512
00:35:37.662 --> 00:35:40.531
Too bad, it was a very
good idea of the clothes.


513
00:35:41.037 --> 00:35:43.159
- my camera! 
- What a disaster!

514
00:35:44.829 --> 00:35:47.153
- it came from the left.
Yes, look.


515
00:35:48.079 --> 00:35:51.114
- I go to the right. haven't
we been through here.


516
00:35:51.955 --> 00:35:55.155
- I think we're lost.
- You shut up!


517
00:35:55.247 --> 00:35:57.286
- we get It! 
- Light! Light!

518
00:35:58.497 --> 00:36:01.662
It's too high, we can't climb.

519
00:36:01.747 --> 00:36:03.490
Ernest, you're taller,
go check it out.


520
00:36:04.789 --> 00:36:08.203
- Why me? - our only
chance to get out.


521
00:36:09.624 --> 00:36:12.030
- Come On, Ernest.
I Will die here.


522
00:36:12.124 --> 00:36:13.701
Well, all right.

523
00:36:17.041 --> 00:36:18.618
- Be Careful. Slow!

524
00:36:21.624 --> 00:36:23.580
Tell us if you see anything.

525
00:36:26.792 --> 00:36:30.159
- are You okay? Yes,
my hand is caught.


526
00:36:30.250 --> 00:36:32.289
What's good? This is stupid!

527
00:36:32.584 --> 00:36:34.659
- we Need to get him out.
- Help him.


528
00:36:34.751 --> 00:36:37.205
I thought it never rains here.

529
00:36:37.292 --> 00:36:41.074
Fast! On the count of three!

530
00:36:42.002 --> 00:36:43.579
Stop!

531
00:36:43.919 --> 00:36:46.788
- loud! - loud! 1, 2, 3!

532
00:36:47.586 --> 00:36:50.336
- It Hurts! It hurts!
- nothing happens.


533
00:36:51.711 --> 00:36:55.291
We have a problem. We can't
get him out and it's raining.


534
00:36:55.378 --> 00:36:57.416
What do we do?
- I'll cut off your hand!


535
00:36:57.544 --> 00:37:00.579
I heard the tour guide? We're all
gonna die here. We cut off his hand!


536
00:37:00.670 --> 00:37:04.748
- But what do you think? And in
"127 hours," cuts off his arm!


537
00:37:04.837 --> 00:37:07.043
- That's a movie!
- Based on a true story!


538
00:37:07.129 --> 00:37:08.955
- How do I cut it?
- I don't know.


539
00:37:09.046 --> 00:37:11.333
Don't worry, my lad!
We'll get you out!


540
00:37:11.421 --> 00:37:15.747
- With the machete! - he's Right.
It is the only solution.


541
00:37:15.838 --> 00:37:18.410
Leave it dry and
take the machete.


542
00:37:18.547 --> 00:37:22.494
Okay, as soon as I point to you,
grab him and leave him dry.


543
00:37:22.589 --> 00:37:24.296
Julie, take my camera.

544
00:37:24.381 --> 00:37:27.794
Are you completely crazy? We
don't cut the hand of Ernest!


545
00:37:27.881 --> 00:37:29.588
- I Have To.
- I Agree with Frank.


546
00:37:29.673 --> 00:37:32.755
It's raining! I will
not die here for him!


547
00:37:32.839 --> 00:37:35.127
I'll just play less the bird.

548
00:37:35.215 --> 00:37:39.839
- Mustafa, you are going to cut the hand!
- my name is Not Mustafa. Why me?


549
00:37:39.924 --> 00:37:41.548
Don't slaughter the sheep?

550
00:37:42.716 --> 00:37:45.501
What do you think?
- Okay, απεγκλωβίστηκα.


551
00:37:47.174 --> 00:37:52.627
I confess, I was starting to worry.
You?


552
00:37:54.759 --> 00:37:56.217
Now!

553
00:37:59.717 --> 00:38:02.289
- are you Stupid?
- Why did you do that?


554
00:38:05.093 --> 00:38:07.843
- Get Up!
- Ernest, are you all right?


555
00:38:12.219 --> 00:38:14.543
- are You okay?
- Come On, Ernest!


556
00:38:15.844 --> 00:38:18.879
- my head Hurts!
you're such a jerk!


557
00:38:18.969 --> 00:38:22.632
- I'm Sorry, I'll be cutting the hand.
- Shut Up!


558
00:38:23.553 --> 00:38:25.260
See! Light!

559
00:38:25.636 --> 00:38:27.178
We're not from here!

560
00:38:28.054 --> 00:38:30.342
Damn it, I knew it! We're lost!

561
00:38:30.429 --> 00:38:35.004
I will not lose the photo
shoot for the κωλοεκδρομή!


562
00:38:35.096 --> 00:38:39.043
Give me the camera. It
will help Γιολάντ. Give.


563
00:38:40.846 --> 00:38:44.046
- Help us. 
- Come On.

564
00:38:51.014 --> 00:38:53.338
Come On, Γιολάντ.

565
00:38:54.014 --> 00:38:58.507
- Ok. You're right, Γιολάντ it?
Stop to think of me as a cripple!


566
00:38:59.056 --> 00:39:00.052
Come On, Julie.

567
00:39:01.766 --> 00:39:03.094
Okay... Come On...

568
00:39:04.808 --> 00:39:06.799
Okay? Come On, Erica.

569
00:39:14.141 --> 00:39:15.516
- Hello! - come on, come on!

570
00:39:17.100 --> 00:39:18.298
Come on, you idiot!

571
00:39:18.601 --> 00:39:20.344
Well done, my friend.

572
00:39:20.851 --> 00:39:23.554
Come On, Alex.

573
00:39:29.060 --> 00:39:31.016
I got something in my shorts!

574
00:39:31.185 --> 00:39:35.049
I don't know! A bug! Help! Help!

575
00:39:37.603 --> 00:39:41.680
Crazy! It looks like the
spider in the book for Brazil.


576
00:39:41.769 --> 00:39:43.311
It bit me, I think.

577
00:39:43.394 --> 00:39:46.808
Cut the plate. You
have 12 hours to cure.


578
00:39:47.145 --> 00:39:50.974
- you Think or you sure it bit you?
- Sure, I think.


579
00:39:51.061 --> 00:39:53.551
We need to know. Put
down the boxers.


580
00:39:53.688 --> 00:39:56.177
Yes, put it down. 
- No Way.

581
00:39:56.313 --> 00:39:58.719
Come on, we have
seen a lot of cocks.


582
00:40:00.646 --> 00:40:02.934
In the locker room, I mean.

583
00:40:05.355 --> 00:40:08.270
- Come on, take it down.
- Stand up and take it down.


584
00:40:10.231 --> 00:40:13.929
- pull Down the boxers!
- Are you sure?


585
00:40:17.106 --> 00:40:18.386
Fruit?

586
00:40:19.648 --> 00:40:23.097
Will not put up with someone
else to see you naked my own.


587
00:40:29.316 --> 00:40:32.516
- Today is the big day!
- We have a small hitch.


588
00:40:32.608 --> 00:40:35.975
- Something serious?
- No. It's all good.


589
00:40:36.650 --> 00:40:40.479
My mother disappeared in the jungle
with friends of my daughter.


590
00:40:40.566 --> 00:40:42.025
Oh, my god!

591
00:40:42.150 --> 00:40:46.097
- Let's postpone it.
- No, we'll find them with the video.


592
00:40:46.401 --> 00:40:49.021
It won't take long. Immediately
after, do the ceremony.


593
00:40:49.109 --> 00:40:52.559
No problem. Take your time.
Above all, the family.


594
00:40:52.651 --> 00:40:55.437
"Ομπριγκάντο". Thank you.
Fernando!


595
00:40:57.276 --> 00:41:02.065
Three κοκτέιλος for the amigos
with orange juice and standing!


596
00:41:02.986 --> 00:41:06.933
- I don't understand. - orange
Juice with straws, you fool!


597
00:41:10.153 --> 00:41:11.730
Has all purple, you know.

598
00:41:14.278 --> 00:41:17.396
What is this?
- See It! A glider!


599
00:41:18.112 --> 00:41:19.487
Help!

600
00:41:20.404 --> 00:41:22.894
- I don't see us! 
- Help!

601
00:41:24.321 --> 00:41:28.019
Don't listen to us!
Wait, I have an idea!


602
00:41:28.155 --> 00:41:29.530
Get off!

603
00:41:29.655 --> 00:41:32.488
- It. - let it go. You
nasty piece of shit.


604
00:41:32.572 --> 00:41:34.445
How does this work?

605
00:41:38.698 --> 00:41:41.022
Why'd you drop on it?

606
00:41:49.198 --> 00:41:52.565
You arabs have a bit of an
issue with what he throws.


607
00:41:52.657 --> 00:41:56.521
- you killed Him.
- I'm Hot. I'll die, I know.


608
00:41:56.991 --> 00:42:01.200
We can't drag him. We
need to make a stretcher.


609
00:42:01.283 --> 00:42:05.609
- I can't feel my leg.
- we take care of him.


610
00:42:05.700 --> 00:42:09.861
- I Had to throw it next to him.
- He went out and fell on top of it.


611
00:42:11.200 --> 00:42:14.283
- Any word from the tour guide?
- Has amnesia.


612
00:42:14.368 --> 00:42:15.945
Has a lot of nerve.

613
00:42:18.118 --> 00:42:21.698
- What is this again?
- Come close to me, I'm afraid.


614
00:42:22.868 --> 00:42:24.149
It's a bird!

615
00:42:24.368 --> 00:42:27.652
- Come...
- Stay by my side, you never know.


616
00:42:28.786 --> 00:42:32.118
- What a cute little guy!
- Little...


617
00:42:39.078 --> 00:42:42.077
Oh, my god! They found
a κυανόραμφο toucan!


618
00:42:42.245 --> 00:42:45.742
- Look! Same bird with your own!
- What a beautiful!


619
00:42:45.870 --> 00:42:46.866
Look!

620
00:42:53.288 --> 00:42:54.367
Has and eggs!

621
00:42:54.747 --> 00:42:55.742
Eggs!

622
00:42:55.997 --> 00:43:01.034
- Will revive the genre!
- friends of my daughter.


623
00:43:05.540 --> 00:43:07.780
What a beautiful nature!

624
00:43:08.248 --> 00:43:11.413
- I have cooked now. 
- Burn.

625
00:43:13.207 --> 00:43:17.249
- What a delicious, damn it!
- it's Missing a little salt.


626
00:43:17.915 --> 00:43:20.749
Who is the king of omelette you?

627
00:43:23.291 --> 00:43:26.872
Friends of yours? A disgrace!
I don't know them well.


628
00:43:27.875 --> 00:43:29.369
Nice life you got, huh?

629
00:43:29.458 --> 00:43:32.162
- The stretcher? 
- Ready.

630
00:43:32.459 --> 00:43:36.074
What are you eating?
- Eggs κυανόραμφου toucan. Delicious!


631
00:43:36.167 --> 00:43:39.332
You didn't hear Jean-Pierre?
Are extinct species!


632
00:43:39.418 --> 00:43:43.460
- No, than what you see.
- don't touch it again animal.


633
00:43:44.085 --> 00:43:46.491
Fortunately, I saw the turtles.

634
00:43:46.627 --> 00:43:48.749
- What did you do to the turtles?
- Nothing.


635
00:43:48.877 --> 00:43:52.160
- Damn, it hurts! - a
long time we have lost!


636
00:43:52.627 --> 00:43:55.413
- let's Go, Frank, it hurts.
Yes, it hurts.


637
00:43:58.462 --> 00:44:00.039
Isn't that great?

638
00:44:00.962 --> 00:44:02.455
cozy looks like.

639
00:44:05.087 --> 00:44:06.201
The holdup is.

640
00:44:06.295 --> 00:44:09.579
Say what you want, but
like Brittany does.


641
00:44:10.420 --> 00:44:14.367
- Shit, a dead end! - damn
it, you're gonna drop me!


642
00:44:14.463 --> 00:44:17.332
I'm putting it down.
It is very heavy.


643
00:44:18.422 --> 00:44:20.994
Not here, I'll wet my ass!

644
00:44:21.547 --> 00:44:24.878
- are You okay?
- I'll never find the plane.


645
00:44:24.964 --> 00:44:27.251
Don't worry, we'll find it.

646
00:44:27.380 --> 00:44:30.498
Thank you for the trip.
That's a great idea!


647
00:44:30.590 --> 00:44:31.586
Please.

648
00:44:32.465 --> 00:44:35.713
I don't want to be pessimistic,
but we're all gonna die!


649
00:44:36.632 --> 00:44:38.956
To think that now I
would do sunbathing...


650
00:44:39.049 --> 00:44:42.629
I'm sorry, the lady makes
with the stretcher.


651
00:44:48.300 --> 00:44:50.007
<i>Has gone away, huh?</i>

652
00:44:55.217 --> 00:44:56.545
They killed mom!

653
00:44:59.967 --> 00:45:03.132
<i>Has escaped the situation! Mr.
Lamar, we didn't mean it!</i>


654
00:45:03.217 --> 00:45:05.707
We didn't lose on purpose, mom!

655
00:45:06.177 --> 00:45:07.754
Even the tour guide!

656
00:45:08.927 --> 00:45:11.594
We're gonna die,
let's blame him!


657
00:45:14.927 --> 00:45:16.469
Don't move!

658
00:45:18.386 --> 00:45:21.503
- Damn It! A black panther!
- it's Not black, fool!


659
00:45:21.594 --> 00:45:23.385
Damn it! A yellow panther.

660
00:45:23.470 --> 00:45:27.050
Beautiful animal.
Don't move, kitty.


661
00:45:27.137 --> 00:45:29.543
Wait... - it's nothing.

662
00:45:31.179 --> 00:45:33.135
Wait, I have an idea.

663
00:45:34.262 --> 00:45:36.752
To take a commemorative selfie.

664
00:45:36.971 --> 00:45:40.219
With that?... To think
that we have a pistol!


665
00:45:40.305 --> 00:45:44.679
- animals don't know from guns.
- I will know that it is fake.


666
00:45:49.514 --> 00:45:51.257
What the hell is this?

667
00:45:55.056 --> 00:45:56.466
Damn it!

668
00:45:58.682 --> 00:46:00.590
Cannibals. I'll eat them.

669
00:46:12.307 --> 00:46:16.931
Bite from spider a banana, he says.
We have to let the poison out.


670
00:46:20.309 --> 00:46:22.549
It looks like it really hurts.

671
00:46:27.226 --> 00:46:28.968
What does the lord say?

672
00:46:29.476 --> 00:46:32.345
- he's sucking out the poison.
- That's Right.


673
00:46:37.519 --> 00:46:42.971
Guys, we found the sedan,
but not the Yolanda.


674
00:46:44.477 --> 00:46:46.055
What's going on?

675
00:46:49.270 --> 00:46:50.681
I don't know.

676
00:46:51.312 --> 00:46:52.687
It takes him a blowjob.

677
00:46:55.062 --> 00:46:58.014
- No, it's sucking him in.
- it takes Him a blowjob.


678
00:46:58.687 --> 00:47:02.896
- Where do we go?
- I don't know, we're safe with them.


679
00:47:03.271 --> 00:47:05.761
- Look better.
- I am in less Pain.


680
00:47:05.896 --> 00:47:08.018
What's with that face then?

681
00:47:08.605 --> 00:47:12.054
I tell Sonia that we lost her
grandmother in the jungle?


682
00:47:16.022 --> 00:47:19.140
- Awesome! What is this?

683
00:47:24.565 --> 00:47:28.691
- How cute!
- I have diseases! Stop touching me!


684
00:47:33.024 --> 00:47:34.518
What big udders!

685
00:47:37.358 --> 00:47:39.563
Sam, it's all ξεκωλιάρες!

686
00:47:40.774 --> 00:47:44.106
Finally! Where have you been?

687
00:47:44.359 --> 00:47:47.228
Γιολάντ, 
I don't believe it!

688
00:47:47.401 --> 00:47:49.143
<i>How nice to see you!</i>

689
00:47:49.651 --> 00:47:53.231
- What would you say?
- it's good, I hope.


690
00:47:53.318 --> 00:47:57.229
- it Stinks in here. don't say that.
It's saved us.


691
00:47:59.152 --> 00:48:01.855
And is that a reason
not to wash it?


692
00:48:01.944 --> 00:48:05.690
- didn't drown, so what?
- No, thanks to you, though.


693
00:48:08.111 --> 00:48:10.435
The chief of the
village, I think.


694
00:48:12.111 --> 00:48:16.153
We... we're looking for a hotel.

695
00:48:17.321 --> 00:48:22.524
never mind, I'll show them
the postcard and the hotel.


696
00:48:24.196 --> 00:48:26.069
- don't you have another? 
- No.

697
00:48:26.238 --> 00:48:27.696
Seriously?

698
00:48:30.613 --> 00:48:34.394
We... hotel... here.

699
00:48:54.741 --> 00:48:56.282
What does it say?

700
00:48:58.116 --> 00:49:00.688
That his underwear
has a hole in it.


701
00:49:00.949 --> 00:49:05.608
I knew that I should stay here tonight.
It will take us tomorrow.


702
00:49:07.659 --> 00:49:10.693
- awesome! 
- Finally a good new!

703
00:49:11.242 --> 00:49:13.069
- Perfect!

704
00:49:15.326 --> 00:49:17.448
Have bonded as a group.

705
00:49:17.900 --> 00:49:21.300
<i>- official English

Stink a little, huh?

709
00:50:18.416 --> 00:50:20.906
What strange fruit is this?

710
00:50:24.541 --> 00:50:28.488
Frank, try if it's tasty.
- No, thank you.


711
00:50:28.583 --> 00:50:30.077
Selfish!

712
00:50:32.166 --> 00:50:34.324
Ernest, grandma, will you try?

713
00:50:34.418 --> 00:50:35.911

Are you okay?

718
00:50:52.753 --> 00:50:55.289
- The name of your girl?

- Do You Think?

720
00:51:01.920 --> 00:51:04.125
I was gonna propose.

721
00:51:04.420 --> 00:51:05.878
<i>What?</i>

722
00:51:06.920 --> 00:51:10.536
<i>I Overheard a conversation where
he said that he had doubts.</i>


723
00:51:12.088 --> 00:51:13.961
<i>I'm Not sure anymore.</i>

724
00:51:14.796 --> 00:51:17.499
<i>understand. I had the
same with a guy.</i>


725
00:51:18.588 --> 00:51:20.544
I said it in a fit of rage.

726
00:51:20.921 --> 00:51:24.086
Frogs ' legs! But
who likes them?


727
00:51:24.463 --> 00:51:25.957
- To me. 
- To me.

728
00:51:28.923 --> 00:51:31.875
- you Want some beer?
- No, it's okay.


729
00:51:33.590 --> 00:51:38.378
We put him to bed, but it disappeared.
We've looked everywhere.


730
00:51:39.340 --> 00:51:41.581
- are You okay? 
- Very loud!

731
00:51:42.257 --> 00:51:44.047
Very tasty broth.

732
00:51:44.341 --> 00:51:47.672
Sam, your nose didn't it?

733
00:51:50.550 --> 00:51:53.300
Don't laugh, you put
it in your mouth!


734
00:51:56.008 --> 00:52:00.169
Gross! See what hot chick
is the wife of a chief?


735
00:52:00.758 --> 00:52:02.715
The wings are a mess.

736
00:52:02.801 --> 00:52:04.343
Τσατσαούμ!

737
00:52:08.468 --> 00:52:11.171
To get, the ceremony
told us the tour guide!


738
00:52:11.260 --> 00:52:13.666
But where is the guide?

739
00:52:14.468 --> 00:52:17.752
- one of us will the jump. -?

740
00:52:19.511 --> 00:52:24.632
Who? You're all barred on a technicality.
Damn, I'm the only one.


741
00:52:25.345 --> 00:52:28.048
I will sacrifice myself for
the sake of your children!


742
00:52:39.013 --> 00:52:43.257
"Τσατσαούμ" is a verb? Go
to "τσατσαουμηθούμε"it?


743
00:52:43.346 --> 00:52:44.924
Bitch!

744
00:52:47.680 --> 00:52:48.676
Shall we go inside?

745
00:52:51.472 --> 00:52:54.885
- Damn It!
- This is the same Jabba the Hutt!


746
00:52:56.431 --> 00:53:01.303
This is the wife of a chief? I
don't go, I don't want to die.


747
00:53:01.390 --> 00:53:04.590
Sam, you've done
worse at Club Med!


748
00:53:06.557 --> 00:53:09.757
Don't upset them. If you
don't do it for you...


749
00:53:09.890 --> 00:53:11.633
Go, my lad.

750
00:53:12.016 --> 00:53:13.676
Do it for me!

751
00:53:14.350 --> 00:53:16.970
- Hello, Sam! Τσατσαούμ!

752
00:53:18.350 --> 00:53:19.760
Damn it!

753
00:53:22.642 --> 00:53:25.890
Courage, Toufik! 
Give it to her!

754
00:53:30.435 --> 00:53:31.929
Deep breath!

755
00:53:39.352 --> 00:53:40.348
Good!

756
00:53:43.477 --> 00:53:46.262
What they put in the nose?
- Powder from leaves cocoa.


757
00:53:46.353 --> 00:53:49.637
The snort in the holidays. It is
an aphrodisiac, a hallucinogen.


758
00:53:49.728 --> 00:53:51.601
And it works? 
- It Depends.

759
00:53:55.437 --> 00:53:57.843
Here it works, from
what it looks like.


760
00:53:59.562 --> 00:54:00.890
What a nice!

761
00:54:00.979 --> 00:54:03.551
- Damn It! - it's Not your best.

762
00:54:03.771 --> 00:54:05.562
How? He has tits.

763
00:54:07.938 --> 00:54:10.890
Mr Μασιέ! Fernando!
The gringo ate it!


764
00:54:10.980 --> 00:54:14.098
Has σπασμοφιλία.
Pick up his feet!


765
00:54:14.897 --> 00:54:17.303
Michelle, tell me you're okay!

766
00:54:19.647 --> 00:54:23.428
Meet. You help him up, Fernando.

767
00:54:25.023 --> 00:54:28.639
- that's Right! - ice! Gently!

768
00:54:28.815 --> 00:54:31.056
- Say your name! 
- Michelle...

769
00:54:31.357 --> 00:54:33.598
- Michelle what?
- Michelle Μασιέ...


770
00:54:33.690 --> 00:54:34.971
Okay...

771
00:54:40.067 --> 00:54:42.272
What did they do to the turtles?

772
00:54:43.108 --> 00:54:45.432
What did they do to the turtles?
- Very strange.


773
00:54:45.525 --> 00:54:46.805
The disguised.

774
00:55:15.487 --> 00:55:16.862
Get out! Get out!

775
00:55:19.654 --> 00:55:21.064
What a crazy party!

776
00:55:29.613 --> 00:55:32.103
Frank, where have you been?

777
00:55:33.030 --> 00:55:34.654
Where were you?

778
00:55:35.989 --> 00:55:38.395
What's wrong with you?
What is this?


779
00:55:38.489 --> 00:55:41.025
- What happened to you?
- Look At You.


780
00:55:43.614 --> 00:55:47.194
- Damn It! What is this?
Why did they do it?


781
00:55:47.282 --> 00:55:49.569
- Why do they put a stick in the nose?
- Your go.


782
00:55:49.657 --> 00:55:51.316
Hold on to the camera.

783
00:55:58.907 --> 00:56:00.282
It hurts so much!

784
00:56:01.116 --> 00:56:02.989
You fool, you go too.

785
00:56:03.824 --> 00:56:05.199
Damn it!

786
00:56:06.200 --> 00:56:08.358
Frank, look what I taught them.

787
00:56:09.284 --> 00:56:12.152
My friends, here it is...

788
00:56:12.450 --> 00:56:14.028
Paris!

789
00:56:14.784 --> 00:56:16.491
- Here it is... 
- Paris!

790
00:56:17.201 --> 00:56:19.773
Crazy fun! Give me the camera.

791
00:56:22.368 --> 00:56:24.325
- Where do we go?
- I don't know.


792
00:56:25.369 --> 00:56:28.119
- It Stinks! 
- I'm Sorry.

793
00:56:28.202 --> 00:56:30.952
- It Stinks!
- I'm Sorry, the food last night.


794
00:56:31.035 --> 00:56:32.908
- damn it! - it wasn't me.

795
00:56:32.994 --> 00:56:35.199
- Smells bad. 
- Disgust.

796
00:56:36.827 --> 00:56:39.282
- What a stink! What is this?

797
00:56:41.537 --> 00:56:44.655
What βρομύλοι the Indians!
I had to throw away trash!


798
00:56:44.745 --> 00:56:49.285
It's not their own. Here are our clothes.
They smell the same.


799
00:56:49.371 --> 00:56:52.370
Here they found, do you think?
It's not okay.


800
00:56:53.371 --> 00:56:55.409
How do they make such a thing?

801
00:56:56.330 --> 00:57:00.788
- The battle is not over, Michelle.
- ecology is a constant struggle.


802
00:57:00.914 --> 00:57:05.240
But thanks to soldiers like
you, maybe win the battle.


803
00:57:05.331 --> 00:57:08.744
It touches me that you would say that.
Thank you.


804
00:57:08.831 --> 00:57:12.244
Thank you... Great guy.

805
00:57:22.624 --> 00:57:25.493
What did he say?
- I didn't understand, but it was nice.


806
00:57:25.582 --> 00:57:28.249
Wait, I want to
tell you something.


807
00:57:31.084 --> 00:57:35.292
I don't understand, but I speak
from my heart. This is a universal.


808
00:57:35.375 --> 00:57:39.157
The people of the city contaminate
the forests. And that shocked me.


809
00:57:39.751 --> 00:57:44.208
<i>And yet, you for agreeing to see
us and feed us like family.</i>


810
00:57:44.292 --> 00:57:47.825
<i>From all my crew,
a big thank you.</i>


811
00:57:48.752 --> 00:57:52.249
<i>I will never forget. 
Thank you.</i>

812
00:58:00.794 --> 00:58:02.288
Bravo, my love!

813
00:58:11.254 --> 00:58:12.748
<i>it's nothing...</i>

814
00:58:13.379 --> 00:58:15.122
<i>Wait...</i>

815
00:58:15.212 --> 00:58:17.204
<i>we Need water. 
Sam, water.</i>

816
00:58:17.296 --> 00:58:20.912
<i>- There you go! Water!
- Will switch off immediately! Don't worry.</i>


817
00:58:22.714 --> 00:58:24.587
<i>No! This is alcohol!</i>

818
00:58:29.797 --> 00:58:34.041
<i>it's nothing! We'll bring water!
It's nothing!</i>


819
00:58:36.548 --> 00:58:38.255
Let's go!

820
00:58:39.548 --> 00:58:41.670
We'll be back later!

821
00:58:42.257 --> 00:58:44.332
Do it!

822
00:58:45.091 --> 00:58:46.668
Way! Way!

823
00:58:51.591 --> 00:58:56.048
- Not so fast! <i>Sam,
we have the Γιολάντ!</i>


824
00:58:56.508 --> 00:58:57.622
<i>Wait!</i>

825
00:58:59.134 --> 00:59:00.509
Fast!

826
00:59:01.092 --> 00:59:03.049
- Where is the plane?
- Straight!


827
00:59:03.134 --> 00:59:06.003
- are they hunting Us?
- No, I can't hear them! Run!


828
00:59:06.093 --> 00:59:09.210
- you are Not γοργοπόδαροι!
- it Is very heavy.


829
00:59:09.301 --> 00:59:12.004
- Alex, quickly!
- The camera is heavy.


830
00:59:12.093 --> 00:59:15.424
- I'll put it down. 
- Come On!

831
00:59:17.302 --> 00:59:19.792
I'm sorry, how will
we cross the river?


832
00:59:19.886 --> 00:59:22.506
What the fuck again?
- we Have to jump!


833
00:59:22.594 --> 00:59:27.052
- I don't know if it's deep.
- one way To find out.


834
00:59:33.387 --> 00:59:36.340
You are not okay!
I could fall out!


835
00:59:36.429 --> 00:59:38.136
- it Is deep! 
- Perfect!

836
00:59:40.804 --> 00:59:41.800
<i>Jump.</i>

837
00:59:42.054 --> 00:59:46.096
<i>- it's too dangerous.</i>
- Don't freak out!


838
00:59:46.180 --> 00:59:49.297
The girls are afraid of.
Not going to jump.


839
00:59:54.097 --> 00:59:58.175
- Jumped, as you can see.
- We have an 86-year-old, I remind you!


840
00:59:58.264 --> 01:00:01.217
If you jump, I'll
break anyone's hip.


841
01:00:01.306 --> 01:00:02.302
Pussy!

842
01:00:08.099 --> 01:00:09.379
The hell!

843
01:00:18.266 --> 01:00:22.178
I had to clench my legs!
I broke the original...


844
01:00:23.891 --> 01:00:26.642
- come on, Come on! 
- It Hurts!

845
01:00:29.351 --> 01:00:30.347
Let's go!

846
01:00:32.184 --> 01:00:33.678
How are you, Γιολάντ it?

847
01:00:35.476 --> 01:00:37.219
- Hop On. 
- Move Out.

848
01:00:38.018 --> 01:00:41.385
- Completely crazy!
- Wait, I'll help you.


849
01:00:42.144 --> 01:00:43.472
Are you okay?

850
01:00:43.769 --> 01:00:45.049
In the face!

851
01:00:52.936 --> 01:00:54.809
Alex, give me your hand.

852
01:00:56.686 --> 01:00:58.180
Damn it! There it is!

853
01:00:58.728 --> 01:01:01.478
Not going to jump. They're
afraid of the water!


854
01:01:03.271 --> 01:01:07.846
Damn it, jump! Fuck the assholes!
Fast!


855
01:01:07.938 --> 01:01:10.095
Alex, quickly! Your hand!

856
01:01:11.105 --> 01:01:12.646
Fast!

857
01:01:23.856 --> 01:01:26.690
I threw the parachute.
Will you help me down?


858
01:01:26.773 --> 01:01:31.515
I don't have time. Tell that
to the Indians. Are friendly.


859
01:01:37.191 --> 01:01:39.099
Let's go! The plane!

860
01:01:39.608 --> 01:01:44.480
Went wrong bad the Indians,
because we burned down a cabin!


861
01:01:44.566 --> 01:01:48.692
- I can't let her go!
- Don't leave me!


862
01:01:50.025 --> 01:01:52.266
- Come On, Γιολάντ!
- Hop on my back!


863
01:01:52.359 --> 01:01:53.937
He climbed up, grandma!

864
01:02:05.777 --> 01:02:09.060
- I Need to get something.
- Not enough time.


865
01:02:17.278 --> 01:02:18.274
Here we go!

866
01:02:23.737 --> 01:02:25.314
Where is the Γιολάντ it?

867
01:02:26.988 --> 01:02:29.655
But what does it do? Wrong?

868
01:02:32.113 --> 01:02:33.820
Faster, Γιολάντ!

869
01:02:46.281 --> 01:02:48.024
Give me your hand!

870
01:02:48.865 --> 01:02:50.240
Mom...

871
01:02:51.656 --> 01:02:53.316
Give me your hand!

872
01:02:55.740 --> 01:02:58.312
But what does it do?
Stupid is the old lady?


873
01:03:01.866 --> 01:03:03.775
Stop It, Ernest!

874
01:03:11.242 --> 01:03:12.735
Γιολάντ, are you okay?

875
01:03:13.200 --> 01:03:15.571
You left me here, you bastards!

876
01:03:16.575 --> 01:03:18.614
Sam, my camera!

877
01:03:21.243 --> 01:03:24.740
What are you doing? I
Will eat it in the wild!


878
01:03:32.535 --> 01:03:34.693
Ernest, quickly!

879
01:03:38.370 --> 01:03:42.530
- Why'd you bring it on the plane?
- I will come alone, you idiot!


880
01:03:42.620 --> 01:03:44.742
See! The tour guide!

881
01:03:45.120 --> 01:03:47.787
Will not go without a guide!

882
01:03:51.037 --> 01:03:53.278
He never did anything to them.

883
01:04:15.832 --> 01:04:16.946
We took off!

884
01:04:17.707 --> 01:04:19.200
Awesome!

885
01:04:24.790 --> 01:04:26.367
<i>well done, Ernest!</i>

886
01:04:28.625 --> 01:04:31.328
Damn, that's awesome!

887
01:04:33.917 --> 01:04:35.458
Why do you have a
face like this?


888
01:04:35.542 --> 01:04:39.453
Ernest has been flying a plane
only in the Ρlaystatίοn.


889
01:04:40.375 --> 01:04:44.322
- a Bad thing. Yes,
bad, as you say.


890
01:04:45.793 --> 01:04:49.077
Wait... Ok!

891
01:04:51.752 --> 01:04:54.621
- What's that noise?
What is this?


892
01:04:54.752 --> 01:04:56.080
Are you serious?

893
01:04:56.377 --> 01:05:02.043
- We have a bit of a problem.
- What's the problem, Ernest is?


894
01:05:02.128 --> 01:05:05.293
I threw out all the fuel!
What an idiot!


895
01:05:05.378 --> 01:05:08.662
What? 
- Land!

896
01:05:08.753 --> 01:05:13.626
Impossible! Only the sea and trees!
Let me concentrate.


897
01:05:14.587 --> 01:05:16.828
The engine stopped!
We're gonna die!


898
01:05:16.920 --> 01:05:18.462
Shut Up, Erica!

899
01:05:18.837 --> 01:05:21.125
It's your fault! I hate you!

900
01:05:22.172 --> 01:05:25.005
We wanted to cheer you up!

901
01:05:25.172 --> 01:05:26.749
That's enough! Sit down!

902
01:05:27.922 --> 01:05:29.416
Here you go.

903
01:05:31.214 --> 01:05:33.419
What is this? what do You think?

904
01:05:33.839 --> 01:05:38.379
- don't run with a parachute!
- Forget it, girls. ’purpose.


905
01:05:38.465 --> 01:05:41.168
Me, I know! I don't go
down with a parachute!


906
01:05:43.549 --> 01:05:45.670
We don't even know
how they work.


907
01:05:45.757 --> 01:05:49.040
Very simple. Count to 30 and
pull the orange handle.


908
01:05:49.132 --> 01:05:52.712
- as simple As that?
- Last chance! Fast!


909
01:05:52.882 --> 01:05:53.997
Crazy!

910
01:05:55.300 --> 01:05:58.382
- Is that normal?
- No, it's not.


911
01:05:58.467 --> 01:06:02.675
- The grandmother broke down the chute.
- Jump, children. I'll stay here.


912
01:06:02.759 --> 01:06:04.169
- Ok. 
- Quickly!

913
01:06:05.467 --> 01:06:08.170
It's not okay. Give me that!

914
01:06:09.426 --> 01:06:11.750
- What will you do?
- that's a Good question.


915
01:06:13.885 --> 01:06:15.877
<i>don't be a hero.</i>

916
01:06:15.969 --> 01:06:19.051
- Great, I blocked the remote!
- Who can fly?


917
01:06:19.135 --> 01:06:22.170
- I Have to stand it, Frank.
I hope so.


918
01:06:25.761 --> 01:06:27.089
Tighten the belts!

919
01:06:30.345 --> 01:06:32.254
Put glasses!

920
01:06:33.137 --> 01:06:35.212
- Put the strap on. 
- Right?

921
01:06:37.637 --> 01:06:39.380
You first!

922
01:06:39.929 --> 01:06:42.253
- Where? 
- Get it first!

923
01:06:42.346 --> 01:06:44.219
- With a parachute? 
- Yeah!

924
01:06:52.514 --> 01:06:53.510
Go for it!

925
01:06:53.889 --> 01:06:58.843
- And Ernest's? - throw Him.
Opens at 500 meters.


926
01:07:07.599 --> 01:07:09.092
Now you, Γιολάντ!

927
01:07:22.309 --> 01:07:24.265
I'm afraid of! 
I'm afraid of!

928
01:07:25.934 --> 01:07:26.965
On the count of three...

929
01:08:36.649 --> 01:08:40.810
I'm alive! I'm alive!

930
01:08:40.899 --> 01:08:44.099
Oh, my god, I'm alive!

931
01:08:45.399 --> 01:08:46.976
Where is the brake?

932
01:08:48.692 --> 01:08:50.352
This must be it.

933
01:08:55.192 --> 01:08:56.770
It's not the brake!

934
01:08:59.234 --> 01:09:04.106
No, damn it! I don't
want to jump in the sea!


935
01:09:04.610 --> 01:09:06.104
Damn it, no!

936
01:09:10.152 --> 01:09:14.692
On the beach! I'm very lucky!

937
01:09:15.694 --> 01:09:17.153
Nice!

938
01:09:17.819 --> 01:09:19.692
Damn, I swallowed a fly!

939
01:09:20.278 --> 01:09:22.732
go to land! sands!

940
01:09:24.154 --> 01:09:27.354
There's turbulence!
Not in the sea!


941
01:09:31.404 --> 01:09:33.361
Not in the sea, damn it!

942
01:10:11.741 --> 01:10:14.148
All right?... Alex,
are you okay?


943
01:10:16.534 --> 01:10:19.071
- The breaks! - awesome!

944
01:10:25.159 --> 01:10:28.112
Okay? Did you break anything?
Were you scared?


945
01:10:28.201 --> 01:10:30.240
A beauty! It was perfect!

946
01:10:32.577 --> 01:10:35.612
- Are You Sure? Yes,
look at this asshole!


947
01:10:36.161 --> 01:10:39.528
- Damn It!
- Ernest, why you landed there?


948
01:10:39.619 --> 01:10:41.694
Do you think I did
it on purpose?


949
01:10:42.453 --> 01:10:45.156
- All right, Ernest it?
- No, I'm not okay.


950
01:10:45.245 --> 01:10:49.109
I have to say a word or two in the guide.
Too bad this trip!


951
01:10:49.204 --> 01:10:52.404
- we'll find a way to get you down.
I hope so.


952
01:10:53.121 --> 01:10:55.326
Don't worry, I've got an idea.

953
01:10:55.413 --> 01:10:59.490
My uncle is a fireman. He
had saved a cat like that.


954
01:10:59.580 --> 01:11:01.370
Go away, you little sloth.

955
01:11:01.746 --> 01:11:04.698
Spread the cloth. It
is not difficult.


956
01:11:05.080 --> 01:11:07.569
Spread the cloth and jump.

957
01:11:07.706 --> 01:11:10.740
What we've been
through on this trip!


958
01:11:11.039 --> 01:11:12.865
You can say that again.

959
01:11:13.456 --> 01:11:14.736
You're sure, huh?

960
01:11:14.831 --> 01:11:18.163
- And you don't know everything.
<-S -> What don't I know?


961
01:11:19.998 --> 01:11:22.120
- I did. What did you do?

962
01:11:22.581 --> 01:11:25.830
- With Frank! No! 
Did you do it?

963
01:11:26.208 --> 01:11:27.701
<i>
- When? Last.</i>

964
01:11:28.041 --> 01:11:30.827
<i>- Came to my cabin.
- was it fun?</i>


965
01:11:30.958 --> 01:11:32.996
<i>I Was so wasted, I
don't remember.</i>


966
01:11:33.791 --> 01:11:36.743
wait, Wait, honey!
- Damn It, Sonia!


967
01:11:36.875 --> 01:11:41.912
<i>- your boyfriend is coming the day after
tomorrow. - That's Right! Take advantage!</i>


968
01:11:47.709 --> 01:11:50.329
He's gone... that makes Sense.

969
01:11:50.460 --> 01:11:52.167
<i>What an asshole!</i>

970
01:11:53.168 --> 01:11:56.084
<i>- are You all right, Ernest it?
- I told You that you will not succeed!</i>


971
01:11:56.168 --> 01:11:58.124
<i>you're Right, it didn't work.</i>

972
01:12:00.961 --> 01:12:03.747
Comandante! The turtles!

973
01:12:05.461 --> 01:12:07.583
<i>I paid for the tickets?</i>

974
01:12:07.670 --> 01:12:09.792
Yeah, don't you remember?

975
01:12:10.711 --> 01:12:13.995
- I Think it loses a little bit.
- thank You.


976
01:12:16.171 --> 01:12:19.703
Γιολάντ, why are you
back on the bike?


977
01:12:20.504 --> 01:12:22.295
To take this one.

978
01:12:23.005 --> 01:12:26.039
What is it? You risked
your life for pictures?


979
01:12:26.130 --> 01:12:28.963
They're all I have left
of my life in France.


980
01:12:29.047 --> 01:12:33.207
When I broke my hip, my son
decided he can't live alone.


981
01:12:34.256 --> 01:12:38.121
Who is this guy? The Μariο
Brοs in the most old!


982
01:12:38.215 --> 01:12:40.420
Give it back! The Here my is.

983
01:12:41.506 --> 01:12:45.667
A widower, he, too, like me.
I miss him very much, too.


984
01:12:46.215 --> 01:12:48.456
Why do you stay here,
if you are not happy?


985
01:12:48.548 --> 01:12:53.372
<i>Jean-Pierre feels safe if I'm close.
For my own good.</i>


986
01:12:53.466 --> 01:12:56.880
<i>Now I understand why he
is dedicated to ecology.</i>


987
01:12:56.966 --> 01:13:00.250
<i>Shit, ecology! He throws
the garbage in the jungle.</i>


988
01:13:00.341 --> 01:13:02.417
<i>Own the dump you
showed the Indians.</i>


989
01:13:02.508 --> 01:13:06.124
Where do you think
are the βρομόρουχά?


990
01:13:08.593 --> 01:13:11.545
What a shame! The
toucan at the hotel!


991
01:13:12.385 --> 01:13:14.127
But what is this?

992
01:13:14.426 --> 01:13:17.923
- Let's Go, Jacky. I've seen enough.
Wait, Wait, Michelle!


993
01:13:19.052 --> 01:13:22.169
Terrible misunderstanding. It's all good.
Please don't go.


994
01:13:22.260 --> 01:13:26.089
Find mom and I'll take
care of those responsible.


995
01:13:28.886 --> 01:13:31.590
Thank You, Michelle.
You won't regret it.


996
01:13:31.720 --> 01:13:34.505
Fernando, three κοκτέιλος
for the amigos.


997
01:13:34.595 --> 01:13:37.464
- With straws? - of
Course, with straws!


998
01:13:37.595 --> 01:13:39.717
<i>I'm Hungry!
- I'm Going to find food.</i>


999
01:13:39.803 --> 01:13:41.381
- Are You Coming, Alex? 
- Yes.

1000
01:13:46.180 --> 01:13:47.757
I'll be right.

1001
01:13:50.597 --> 01:13:52.672
- hurry. 
- Ok.

1002
01:13:53.138 --> 01:13:56.505
- Starts to like me, I think.
- As always!


1003
01:13:56.722 --> 01:14:01.013
I'll take a coconut and
suck their juices.


1004
01:14:07.807 --> 01:14:09.882
No! Damn it!

1005
01:14:11.057 --> 01:14:13.972
Sam, crazy! Awesome!

1006
01:14:14.474 --> 01:14:16.264
We found the hotel.

1007
01:14:17.975 --> 01:14:21.175
- I Have to tell the others.
- Wait!


1008
01:14:21.641 --> 01:14:23.183
- don't tell them. Why?

1009
01:14:23.267 --> 01:14:26.799
If you know Erica, it will be
gone and I'll never see again!


1010
01:14:27.308 --> 01:14:31.090
We'll get food, I score, and
we tell them about the hotel.


1011
01:14:31.184 --> 01:14:33.756
Okay, let's go find food.

1012
01:14:35.310 --> 01:14:36.341
Incognito.

1013
01:14:36.810 --> 01:14:38.848
Don't run! Wait for me!

1014
01:14:42.727 --> 01:14:46.769
- we Have to dress up. Why?
It's not Halloween.


1015
01:14:46.852 --> 01:14:48.262
It has a spa there!

1016
01:14:52.436 --> 01:14:54.014
Come on, come on!

1017
01:14:55.937 --> 01:14:57.312
Fast!

1018
01:15:04.145 --> 01:15:06.433
Are you stupid? We
don't get yogurt!


1019
01:15:06.520 --> 01:15:09.389
You're right. It will
spoil in the heat.


1020
01:15:12.397 --> 01:15:14.270
A fish! Perfect!

1021
01:15:16.438 --> 01:15:18.762
The great brand of Erica!

1022
01:15:19.855 --> 01:15:21.646
Perfect muse!

1023
01:15:21.730 --> 01:15:24.930
Even so, I find it hot.

1024
01:15:25.022 --> 01:15:27.594
You're a doll, baby. I love you.

1025
01:15:36.315 --> 01:15:39.398
- Quickly! Wait, to get fruit!

1026
01:15:41.482 --> 01:15:45.429
- Come on, quickly! Bananas.
- Yes, bananas! My camera!


1027
01:16:01.360 --> 01:16:03.517
Damn it, girls! Bend over!

1028
01:16:09.652 --> 01:16:12.224
- Ask for an apology!
- I'm Sorry.


1029
01:16:18.111 --> 01:16:22.686
- Okay, you can come out!
- Jean-Pierre, I want another!


1030
01:16:22.778 --> 01:16:25.778
Can't be! We have the ceremony!

1031
01:16:26.237 --> 01:16:28.394
What's mom doing with the lord?

1032
01:16:28.487 --> 01:16:32.150
<i>Our care and our lot the ceremony!
We'll do it again later.</i>


1033
01:16:32.237 --> 01:16:34.809
So and see us for
your husband...


1034
01:16:35.362 --> 01:16:37.105
Wait!

1035
01:16:37.197 --> 01:16:39.982
What is that ass?

1036
01:16:47.364 --> 01:16:48.988
What is this?

1037
01:16:50.447 --> 01:16:52.486
The camera of the asshole?

1038
01:16:55.823 --> 01:16:57.981
Is the camera asshole!

1039
01:17:00.074 --> 01:17:03.191
Damn it! Jean-Pierre,
you blew it!


1040
01:17:04.657 --> 01:17:08.522
Michelle, you won't believe me.
Huge misunderstanding.


1041
01:17:09.699 --> 01:17:12.271
- I'll explain.
- What would you explain?


1042
01:17:12.367 --> 01:17:16.278
Your friends made ecological
disasters, throw trash in the jungle!


1043
01:17:16.367 --> 01:17:19.698
And the best! Sleeping
with my wife!


1044
01:17:19.784 --> 01:17:22.902
What would you explain? Do you
think that will give you a label?


1045
01:17:22.992 --> 01:17:26.525
A good ecological conscience!
You're a son of a bitch! And you!


1046
01:17:26.617 --> 01:17:28.775
I'll take you to court!

1047
01:17:28.869 --> 01:17:32.449
- Mr. Lamar's for you.
- To wait.


1048
01:17:32.535 --> 01:17:34.195
I don't think.

1049
01:17:37.952 --> 01:17:40.276
Who are these πλουμιστοί it?

1050
01:17:40.369 --> 01:17:42.112
We are full of.

1051
01:17:44.744 --> 01:17:48.691
Well done, guys. Fortunately
we eat at last.


1052
01:17:49.162 --> 01:17:51.450
You'll find the camera, Alex.

1053
01:17:54.371 --> 01:17:57.204
- I Caught a fish. - it's huge!

1054
01:17:57.287 --> 01:17:59.326
Fish, not funny!

1055
01:18:01.621 --> 01:18:04.193
- Good catch, huh? 
- Incredible!

1056
01:18:04.955 --> 01:18:07.954
Is "stone". Like frozen.

1057
01:18:09.372 --> 01:18:14.196
- Has cold drafts out in the open.
- In Brazil does not have salmon.


1058
01:18:14.581 --> 01:18:17.912
Salmon is this? I
lost the poor guy.


1059
01:18:18.414 --> 01:18:20.986
Thank You, Sam.
You're my savior.


1060
01:18:27.666 --> 01:18:30.238
- let's Go get some wood?
- Gladly.


1061
01:18:30.332 --> 01:18:31.661
Come on, let's go.

1062
01:18:35.708 --> 01:18:37.498
You have impressed me.

1063
01:18:38.542 --> 01:18:40.664
We will be quiet here.

1064
01:18:46.751 --> 01:18:49.620
- they've found Us! We're saved!
- Damn It!


1065
01:18:53.126 --> 01:18:54.999
Julie, they've found us!

1066
01:18:56.752 --> 01:18:58.246
Come on!

1067
01:18:59.502 --> 01:19:02.620
- How did you find us?
- With the GPS, one of the turtles.


1068
01:19:02.711 --> 01:19:04.584
- The turtles? 
- Yes.

1069
01:19:05.336 --> 01:19:08.205
- The rescuers! 
- Get my bag.

1070
01:19:10.378 --> 01:19:12.334
Just when we were having fun.

1071
01:19:12.420 --> 01:19:15.040
- it's Not my fault. 
- I know.

1072
01:19:15.587 --> 01:19:17.330
A lot of people!

1073
01:19:17.421 --> 01:19:20.124
The pictures of us!
We are a star!


1074
01:19:20.212 --> 01:19:21.790
Hello, Brazil!

1075
01:19:21.879 --> 01:19:22.958
Mom!

1076
01:19:23.046 --> 01:19:25.203
- Murderers! Shame on you!

1077
01:19:25.296 --> 01:19:26.790
Assholes!

1078
01:19:38.881 --> 01:19:41.086
Get in there!

1079
01:19:45.048 --> 01:19:47.419
- Mom! Are you okay? - great.

1080
01:19:47.507 --> 01:19:49.333
- I don't hurt you, huh? 
- No.

1081
01:19:49.424 --> 01:19:53.289
- Why are they picking on us?
- Burned the forest, you idiots.


1082
01:19:53.966 --> 01:19:56.088
To save the hotel...

1083
01:19:56.174 --> 01:19:59.126
...I promised to host all
the tribe of free...


1084
01:19:59.216 --> 01:20:01.753
...up to rebuild their village!

1085
01:20:01.841 --> 01:20:03.383
Thank you, man!

1086
01:20:04.092 --> 01:20:06.712
Make and a free bike!

1087
01:20:06.801 --> 01:20:11.045
- We're Sorry. Will make up for it.
- is Not the worst of it.


1088
01:20:11.134 --> 01:20:14.334
It's unforgivable what
you did to my daughter.


1089
01:20:14.426 --> 01:20:19.131
- you Will be, too extinct species!
What did I do to Sonia?


1090
01:20:19.510 --> 01:20:24.298
Are you serious? We found the camera.
You fucked Julie.


1091
01:20:24.386 --> 01:20:27.669
- No Way. Sonia, I love you.
- let go of the lie, Frank.


1092
01:20:27.761 --> 01:20:31.175
I fucked her, I say.
- jumped or not jumped?


1093
01:20:31.261 --> 01:20:32.838
No, he hasn't.

1094
01:20:34.844 --> 01:20:37.548
Wait...
- See It. I collared them.


1095
01:20:39.971 --> 01:20:43.089
Yes, this is when... I'm Sorry.

1096
01:20:44.679 --> 01:20:47.299
Here you go! I jumped!

1097
01:20:48.971 --> 01:20:50.429
Damn it!

1098
01:20:50.513 --> 01:20:54.175
How could you, Ernest for?
You were the man of my life.


1099
01:20:54.555 --> 01:20:56.381
Pedro, we're leaving.

1100
01:20:57.556 --> 01:20:58.552
Son of a bitch!

1101
01:21:01.598 --> 01:21:03.922
- Where is Sonia?
- Go to the airport.


1102
01:21:04.014 --> 01:21:06.136
- catch up to her! 
- No, mom.

1103
01:21:06.223 --> 01:21:09.139
Why not? Thanks to him
I had a good time.


1104
01:21:09.223 --> 01:21:11.973
Sonia's not a baby anymore.
Leave her alone!


1105
01:21:12.056 --> 01:21:16.003
A bit of a jerk, but a good kid.
He gave me the chute.


1106
01:21:17.349 --> 01:21:18.760
Truth is.

1107
01:21:19.141 --> 01:21:22.341
- Go on, my lad! 
- Go On, Frank.

1108
01:21:23.391 --> 01:21:24.850
Finally!

1109
01:21:39.268 --> 01:21:40.762
The ring!

1110
01:21:44.643 --> 01:21:47.761
- But... where's Frank? 
- Left.

1111
01:21:47.852 --> 01:21:52.179
- did you Use my toilet?
- Yes. Don't get better.


1112
01:22:36.606 --> 01:22:39.357
You forgot your passport.
Here you go.


1113
01:22:41.816 --> 01:22:43.393
Is that all?

1114
01:22:45.900 --> 01:22:49.064
- you don't have to tell me something else?
- No.


1115
01:22:49.983 --> 01:22:53.563
Do you want someone to protect you.
That's what you said.


1116
01:22:53.817 --> 01:22:55.855
Yes, but I was angry.

1117
01:22:58.068 --> 01:23:00.640
And I saw how watching
my grandmother.


1118
01:23:02.401 --> 01:23:07.439
- How could you go with her?
- Ernest did. Ask him.


1119
01:23:10.485 --> 01:23:11.895
I don't care for her.

1120
01:23:36.488 --> 01:23:39.937
Goldie, you've got balls now?

1121
01:23:41.238 --> 01:23:44.237
Look at what a proper man!

1122
01:23:44.322 --> 01:23:45.317
Okay!

1123
01:23:45.405 --> 01:23:47.112
Give me a minute.

1124
01:23:50.615 --> 01:23:53.187
Way to go, get to the sea.

1125
01:23:55.656 --> 01:23:57.234
All right, my love?

1126
01:24:05.448 --> 01:24:10.190
You asshole! I will find you!
I swear to you!


1127
01:24:20.533 --> 01:24:23.023
I'm sorry... Where were we?

1128
01:24:23.450 --> 01:24:25.027
Here, I think.

1129
01:24:44.161 --> 01:24:46.034
Long live the newlyweds!

1130
01:24:51.037 --> 01:24:53.242
It's a catch, my love.

1131
01:24:58.579 --> 01:25:00.617
To live, my love.

1132
01:25:03.622 --> 01:25:05.115
Thank You, Γιολάντ.

1133
01:25:05.705 --> 01:25:07.033
And you here?

1134
01:25:07.122 --> 01:25:10.453
After so much emotion,
I'm going to rest.


1135
01:25:10.538 --> 01:25:13.407
Wait, I have a surprise for you.
Fernand!


1136
01:25:15.622 --> 01:25:19.238
Fernand! How nice to see you!

1137
01:25:20.707 --> 01:25:22.200
What?

1138
01:25:23.415 --> 01:25:26.658
- Come on...
- Talk to him out loud!


1139
01:25:27.658 --> 01:25:31.150
Damn it, I'm very happy!
I'll make it up to me!


1140
01:25:31.236 --> 01:25:35.473
- With the waterworks!
- To live the newlyweds!


1141
01:25:39.557 --> 01:25:44.220
Children, to stay here forever!
It is heaven on earth!


1142
01:25:45.229 --> 01:25:47.104
See! The toucan!

1143
01:25:48.274 --> 01:25:50.101
Hello, little birdie!

1144
01:25:50.192 --> 01:25:53.776
Wrong? What does it do?
Give me my camera!


1145
01:25:55.239 --> 01:25:58.407
Give me my camera!
You stupid bird!


1146
01:25:58.492 --> 01:26:03.239
Not again! Give me my camera!
