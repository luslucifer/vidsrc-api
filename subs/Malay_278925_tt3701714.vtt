00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:34.461
<i>His ring...</i>

2
00:00:35.686 --> 00:00:37.893
<i>I spent hours picking it out.</i>

3
00:00:39.123 --> 00:00:40.534
<i>Not knowing...</i>

4
00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:44.838
<i>I tried to ignore the signs, but...</i>

5
00:00:44.928 --> 00:00:47.067
<i>I could smell her on his clothes.</i>

6
00:00:48.732 --> 00:00:51.110
<i>Taste her on his lips.</i>

7
00:00:51.201 --> 00:00:53.511
<i>He confessed. He cried.</i>

8
00:00:53.604 --> 00:00:55.743
<i>I told him I forgave him, but...</i>

9
00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.317
<i>I didn't.</i>

10
00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:00.887
<i>I was broken.</i>

11
00:01:02.412 --> 00:01:04.187
<i>But I guess...</i>

12
00:01:04.281 --> 00:01:07.160
<i>none of us are perfect.</i>

13
00:01:10.521 --> 00:01:13.434
This is the hottest place in town.

14
00:01:14.958 --> 00:01:16.596
Really?

15
00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.610
This place is all kinds of wrong.

16
00:01:24.935 --> 00:01:26.505
Yeah, exactly, and it's perfect for you.

17
00:01:44.755 --> 00:01:45.733
Come on.

18
00:01:55.866 --> 00:01:57.174
You should go talk to him.

19
00:01:57.267 --> 00:01:59.269
I can talk to those boys any time.

20
00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:00.939
This is our weekend.

21
00:02:01.038 --> 00:02:03.416
You're right. We stick together.

22
00:02:03.507 --> 00:02:05.282
You ladies need a round?

23
00:02:05.976 --> 00:02:08.187
Not from you, Red. Thanks.

24
00:02:08.278 --> 00:02:10.121
I'll get us cocktails.

25
00:02:10.214 --> 00:02:13.525
No, I'll do it.

26
00:02:17.487 --> 00:02:20.093
That waitress looked
just like the home-wrecker.


27
00:02:25.462 --> 00:02:27.373
What are you looking for?

28
00:02:28.732 --> 00:02:31.008
Something to make me forget.

29
00:02:31.802 --> 00:02:33.440
If it were only that easy.

30
00:02:38.475 --> 00:02:40.455
You're staring.

31
00:02:42.713 --> 00:02:44.351
I'm sorry.

32
00:02:44.448 --> 00:02:46.587
You remind me of someone.

33
00:02:46.683 --> 00:02:48.594
I hope it's not a bad memory.

34
00:02:51.788 --> 00:02:53.096
She was...

35
00:02:54.791 --> 00:02:57.067
very special to me.

36
00:03:04.368 --> 00:03:05.779
Thank you.

37
00:03:10.307 --> 00:03:11.445
It's good.

38
00:03:11.541 --> 00:03:13.987
Hey, barman,
can I talk to you for a minute?


39
00:03:14.077 --> 00:03:15.249
My name's Patrick.

40
00:03:15.345 --> 00:03:16.551
Tara.

41
00:03:16.647 --> 00:03:17.648
Tara.

42
00:03:17.748 --> 00:03:19.022
Hey, buddy?

43
00:03:19.116 --> 00:03:21.027
Can I talk to you?

44
00:03:21.118 --> 00:03:23.155
You should probably
go take care of that guy.


45
00:03:24.021 --> 00:03:26.524
I don't want to look away.

46
00:03:26.623 --> 00:03:27.897
Why not?

47
00:03:27.991 --> 00:03:29.629
You might disappear.

48
00:03:32.262 --> 00:03:33.434
Nice ink.

49
00:03:35.232 --> 00:03:37.542
Christ, man, get over here!

50
00:03:37.634 --> 00:03:39.443
I'll be right back.

51
00:03:43.674 --> 00:03:45.085
Hey, what the fuck is this?

52
00:03:45.175 --> 00:03:47.621
I'm not paying $40 for two fucking drinks.

53
00:03:48.412 --> 00:03:50.722
You don't have to drink it.

54
00:03:50.814 --> 00:03:52.953
- You can leave.
- I'm gonna kick your ass.


55
00:04:01.491 --> 00:04:02.629
Let's go.

56
00:04:09.666 --> 00:04:11.703
What did you say to that guy?

57
00:04:11.802 --> 00:04:13.110
Nothing.

58
00:04:17.207 --> 00:04:18.709
I sent you all a round.

59
00:04:22.679 --> 00:04:23.749
Thank you.

60
00:04:24.815 --> 00:04:26.556
What do I owe you?

61
00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:27.651
It's on me.

62
00:04:48.238 --> 00:04:49.581
That was so cool!

63
00:04:49.673 --> 00:04:52.244
Where do we get a car?

64
00:04:52.342 --> 00:04:54.083
I gotta go.

65
00:04:54.177 --> 00:04:57.886
Hey, that bartender
you were talking to earlier.


66
00:04:57.981 --> 00:04:59.961
He's standing over there.

67
00:05:02.786 --> 00:05:04.288
He's so hot.

68
00:05:04.388 --> 00:05:06.197
He's so cute. You
should go talk to him.

69
00:05:06.289 --> 00:05:08.064
- Shut up.
- You were already talking to him!


70
00:05:08.158 --> 00:05:09.330
I'm not going to talk to him.

71
00:05:09.426 --> 00:05:11.497
- You were flirting with him.
- You totally were.


72
00:05:11.595 --> 00:05:13.404
Speak louder, that would be great.

73
00:05:13.497 --> 00:05:15.408
- Just talk to him.
- I hate you.


74
00:05:17.934 --> 00:05:19.004
Hi.

75
00:05:22.672 --> 00:05:24.151
You again.

76
00:05:25.675 --> 00:05:27.348
Me again.

77
00:05:45.228 --> 00:05:46.639
I should be going.

78
00:05:58.842 --> 00:06:00.150
Thank you.

79
00:06:04.014 --> 00:06:05.322
Good night.

80
00:06:09.419 --> 00:06:11.057
Shut up. So what?

81
00:06:30.807 --> 00:06:33.185
Who keeps calling?

82
00:06:33.276 --> 00:06:34.277
Man...

83
00:06:37.414 --> 00:06:39.018
No one.

84
00:06:39.115 --> 00:06:41.425
All right, ladies,
it's time for Bloody Marys.


85
00:08:08.471 --> 00:08:09.449
I can't.

86
00:10:39.289 --> 00:10:41.098
You're awake.

87
00:10:45.328 --> 00:10:46.568
Where are my clothes?

88
00:10:47.831 --> 00:10:49.708
They smelled like a club.

89
00:10:49.799 --> 00:10:51.506
I washed them for you.

90
00:10:54.704 --> 00:10:56.684
You washed my clothes?

91
00:10:56.773 --> 00:10:58.309
When?

92
00:10:58.408 --> 00:11:01.218
Couldn't sleep, really.

93
00:11:01.311 --> 00:11:03.120
Don't worry, I handwashed your dress.

94
00:11:04.514 --> 00:11:06.221
They're in the bathroom.

95
00:11:11.321 --> 00:11:13.028
Would you like some coffee?

96
00:11:13.123 --> 00:11:14.761
I brewed some.

97
00:11:14.858 --> 00:11:16.701
Yeah, sure.

98
00:11:19.496 --> 00:11:22.033
Do you have a T-shirt or something?

99
00:11:22.132 --> 00:11:23.611
Yeah, in the wardrobe.

100
00:11:24.834 --> 00:11:26.279
What's mine is yours.

101
00:11:40.016 --> 00:11:41.654
You take sugar and cream?

102
00:11:42.819 --> 00:11:44.924
You know, I...

103
00:11:45.021 --> 00:11:47.558
I'm probably gonna skip
the coffee, actually.


104
00:11:52.595 --> 00:11:54.268
Do you wanna grab breakfast?

105
00:11:56.032 --> 00:11:58.308
I know a place that serves great crepes.

106
00:11:58.401 --> 00:12:00.039
Best in New Orleans.

107
00:12:08.778 --> 00:12:10.086
So?

108
00:12:11.981 --> 00:12:13.756
I have to get going.

109
00:12:15.585 --> 00:12:17.462
- So soon?
- Yeah.


110
00:12:20.089 --> 00:12:22.069
Well, wait. I want to show you something.

111
00:12:24.994 --> 00:12:26.166
You know, I have to catch a flight.

112
00:12:26.262 --> 00:12:28.264
- I'm sorry, I can't.
- It's important.


113
00:12:30.533 --> 00:12:33.070
Okay. What is it?

114
00:12:38.374 --> 00:12:41.287
I meet a lot of girls, and...
but you, you're...


115
00:12:45.782 --> 00:12:47.318
From the moment I met you...

116
00:12:49.986 --> 00:12:51.761
I knew you'd come back for me.

117
00:12:54.624 --> 00:12:56.433
Come back?

118
00:12:56.526 --> 00:12:57.903
Yeah.

119
00:13:04.234 --> 00:13:06.407
You're the one who can save me.

120
00:13:10.173 --> 00:13:12.016
You don't like it?

121
00:13:12.108 --> 00:13:13.917
I did it for you.

122
00:13:14.010 --> 00:13:16.354
I'm sorry. This was a mistake.

123
00:13:16.446 --> 00:13:18.187
Don't say that. 
We have something special.

124
00:13:18.281 --> 00:13:20.659
No, I... I really should have never come.

125
00:13:21.918 --> 00:13:23.625
Don't leave.

126
00:13:26.322 --> 00:13:28.768
You know, I...

127
00:13:28.858 --> 00:13:30.860
I've got to catch my flight.

128
00:13:30.960 --> 00:13:33.668
Why? Stay.

129
00:13:39.569 --> 00:13:41.480
I can't.

130
00:13:44.774 --> 00:13:46.014
I really have to go.

131
00:13:46.109 --> 00:13:48.089
- It's just...
- It's okay.


132
00:13:52.649 --> 00:13:54.458
I need to go now.

133
00:14:22.245 --> 00:14:24.657
Oh, my God. You do realize
our plane leaves in an hour.


134
00:14:24.747 --> 00:14:26.522
Yes, I know.

135
00:14:26.616 --> 00:14:28.220
What the hell happened to you last night?

136
00:14:28.318 --> 00:14:30.525
I fucked up. I don't want to talk
about it right now.


137
00:14:32.355 --> 00:14:33.493
Where's Justine?

138
00:14:33.589 --> 00:14:34.966
She left already.

139
00:14:39.562 --> 00:14:41.473
I can't find my phone.

140
00:14:41.564 --> 00:14:43.373
- Here, I'll call it.
- Thanks.


141
00:15:04.153 --> 00:15:05.860
I don't hear it anywhere.

142
00:15:07.156 --> 00:15:09.033
Shit. My whole life
is in that thing, man.

143
00:15:09.125 --> 00:15:11.469
Well, it's too bad.
You're gonna have to buy a new one.


144
00:15:13.229 --> 00:15:14.867
Let's just go, 
I gotta get out of here.

145
00:15:36.919 --> 00:15:38.296
Hi.

146
00:15:38.388 --> 00:15:39.924
Welcome home, sweetheart.

147
00:15:40.023 --> 00:15:41.696
You're the best.

148
00:15:41.791 --> 00:15:44.863
So, how was the bachelorette weekend?

149
00:15:44.961 --> 00:15:46.838
You know, we did
a bunch of girly stuff.

150
00:15:46.929 --> 00:15:49.000
You would have hated it.

151
00:15:49.098 --> 00:15:50.441
You're such a gentleman.

152
00:15:50.533 --> 00:15:51.637
He is.

153
00:15:51.734 --> 00:15:53.543
Look. It's a picture of your sister.

154
00:15:53.636 --> 00:15:55.980
I told you those dresses were gonna look
great on everyone.


155
00:15:57.940 --> 00:15:59.510
Don't say anything.

156
00:15:59.609 --> 00:16:01.316
Don't say anything. 
It's not worth it.

157
00:16:02.812 --> 00:16:04.917
What are we whispering about?

158
00:16:05.014 --> 00:16:07.358
Well, if we told you,
it wouldn't be a secret.


159
00:16:07.450 --> 00:16:08.656
- I gotta go.
- Bye.


160
00:16:08.751 --> 00:16:10.560
Bye, sweetheart.

161
00:16:10.653 --> 00:16:12.257
- Debra.
- Bye.


162
00:16:13.890 --> 00:16:15.392
- Hi.
- Hi.


163
00:16:18.294 --> 00:16:19.637
So, I'm...

164
00:16:19.729 --> 00:16:23.536
I'm not gonna really be seeing very much
of you these next couple of weeks, am I?


165
00:16:23.633 --> 00:16:26.011
I just need to finish planning everything.

166
00:16:26.102 --> 00:16:27.046
Okay.

167
00:16:29.172 --> 00:16:31.243
I just want one last night.

168
00:16:33.176 --> 00:16:34.621
What's up with your phone?

169
00:16:34.710 --> 00:16:36.155
I've been trying to call.

170
00:17:01.237 --> 00:17:03.114
So, how we doing today?

171
00:17:09.312 --> 00:17:10.518
Well...

172
00:17:14.517 --> 00:17:16.622
I couldn't be better.

173
00:17:16.719 --> 00:17:18.027
I'm in love.

174
00:17:19.021 --> 00:17:20.227
That's great.

175
00:17:26.195 --> 00:17:28.175
She's an angel.

176
00:17:29.832 --> 00:17:31.869
Definitely not this.

177
00:17:31.968 --> 00:17:33.811
- Not this...
- Okay.


178
00:17:33.903 --> 00:17:35.678
You know, I like this for sure.

179
00:17:35.771 --> 00:17:37.546
Okay.

180
00:17:37.640 --> 00:17:38.914
This one, I'm not so sure about.

181
00:17:39.008 --> 00:17:40.214
- Okay.
- I'm sorry, one sec.


182
00:17:40.309 --> 00:17:41.879
Sure.

183
00:17:41.978 --> 00:17:44.288
Excuse me. Hey, babe.

184
00:17:44.380 --> 00:17:47.987
Just wanted to let you know
that I picked up my tux,


185
00:17:48.084 --> 00:17:49.757
and I'm officially done.

186
00:17:49.852 --> 00:17:51.422
<i>I hate you.</i>

187
00:17:51.521 --> 00:17:54.263
Wait. Does that mean
that the wedding is off?


188
00:17:54.357 --> 00:17:55.563
That's such a bummer.

189
00:17:55.658 --> 00:17:57.729
I am so swamped right now.

190
00:17:57.827 --> 00:17:59.397
I have so much more to do.

191
00:17:59.495 --> 00:18:01.406
You know what, babe,
can I call you back in a few?


192
00:18:01.497 --> 00:18:02.498
<i>No, wait.</i>

193
00:18:02.598 --> 00:18:04.578
I want to see you tonight.

194
00:18:04.667 --> 00:18:06.578
Alone.

195
00:18:06.669 --> 00:18:07.841
<i>I don't know, Michael.</i>

196
00:18:07.937 --> 00:18:09.507
<i>I have so many plans to get done.</i>

197
00:18:09.605 --> 00:18:10.549
- <i>And I'm just...</i>
- Babe?


198
00:18:10.640 --> 00:18:11.880
- <i>I'm feeling...</i>
- Babe.


199
00:18:11.974 --> 00:18:13.351
You need to relax, all right?

200
00:18:13.442 --> 00:18:16.116
It's just... just one night.

201
00:18:19.081 --> 00:18:20.754
Okay. When and where?

202
00:18:21.984 --> 00:18:22.962
Where, when?

203
00:18:23.052 --> 00:18:27.026
I'll be at your place at 6:00,
unless I can get out of the hotel earlier.


204
00:18:27.123 --> 00:18:29.103
Okay, it's a date.

205
00:19:07.530 --> 00:19:09.532
I got caught up in the moment, but...

206
00:21:35.911 --> 00:21:37.390
I've missed this.

207
00:21:37.480 --> 00:21:38.788
Me, too.

208
00:21:40.082 --> 00:21:43.256
- What's wrong?
- What are you doing here?


209
00:21:43.352 --> 00:21:45.593
- No, get out!
- Just calm down.


210
00:21:45.688 --> 00:21:48.601
If you don't get out of here right now,
I am calling the cops.


211
00:21:48.691 --> 00:21:51.171
- No...
- Whoa. Hey. Hey!


212
00:21:55.998 --> 00:21:57.170
Oh, my God.

213
00:21:57.266 --> 00:22:00.873
Hey, listen. I just wanted to see you.

214
00:22:04.740 --> 00:22:06.014
That's all.

215
00:22:09.979 --> 00:22:12.050
How did you find me?

216
00:22:14.583 --> 00:22:16.187
You left your phone.

217
00:22:22.825 --> 00:22:24.566
All right, I get it.

218
00:22:26.929 --> 00:22:29.603
I understand. You're surprised to see me.

219
00:22:30.900 --> 00:22:32.971
Maybe if you give me
a chance to talk about it...


220
00:22:33.068 --> 00:22:34.308
No. No.

221
00:22:34.403 --> 00:22:36.178
I have nothing to say to you.

222
00:22:38.040 --> 00:22:39.951
Michael's gonna be here any minute.

223
00:22:41.777 --> 00:22:42.983
Michael?

224
00:22:45.414 --> 00:22:47.587
Michael, your fiancé?

225
00:22:52.788 --> 00:22:55.325
You haven't told him
about us yet, have you?


226
00:22:59.662 --> 00:23:01.573
You know what? Look, I'm...

227
00:23:03.165 --> 00:23:05.873
I'm sorry if I misled you.

228
00:23:07.136 --> 00:23:09.673
But I want to make this perfectly clear.

229
00:23:11.240 --> 00:23:13.720
There is nothing between us.

230
00:23:17.313 --> 00:23:18.792
You don't believe that.

231
00:23:23.719 --> 00:23:25.289
I love you.

232
00:23:26.789 --> 00:23:29.099
I don't understand why
you can't do me the courtesy...


233
00:23:30.192 --> 00:23:32.001
of just talking with me.

234
00:23:33.896 --> 00:23:37.639
Maybe if you open up,
then maybe you'll see...


235
00:23:39.001 --> 00:23:40.105
Shit!

236
00:23:40.202 --> 00:23:41.772
You have to get
out of here right now!

237
00:23:41.871 --> 00:23:43.646
- Get out!
- Not out.


238
00:23:43.739 --> 00:23:45.480
Not until you talk to me.

239
00:23:48.177 --> 00:23:49.884
- You say you love me?
- Yes.


240
00:23:49.979 --> 00:23:51.151
And you don't want to hurt me?

241
00:23:51.247 --> 00:23:52.225
Of course not.

242
00:23:52.314 --> 00:23:55.295
Then I need you to leave right now.

243
00:23:55.384 --> 00:23:56.886
- Please.
- I won't go anywhere


244
00:23:56.986 --> 00:23:58.829
until you tell me you'll meet me.

245
00:23:58.921 --> 00:24:01.731
- Okay, yes, I'll meet you.
- Where?


246
00:24:04.293 --> 00:24:07.297
There's a coffee shop on Lincoln,
just south of Pico.


247
00:24:07.396 --> 00:24:10.674
I can meet you there at 10:00 tomorrow,
but only if you leave now.


248
00:24:10.766 --> 00:24:12.768
- Please.
- Ten.


249
00:24:12.868 --> 00:24:14.074
Yes.

250
00:24:18.908 --> 00:24:20.319
Babe?

251
00:24:24.480 --> 00:24:25.925
You all right?

252
00:24:26.015 --> 00:24:27.460
Yeah.

253
00:24:27.550 --> 00:24:29.029
Yeah, I was...

254
00:24:29.118 --> 00:24:31.257
I was about to get in the shower,

255
00:24:31.353 --> 00:24:33.390
and I thought I heard a noise.

256
00:24:33.489 --> 00:24:35.435
Noise?

257
00:24:35.524 --> 00:24:38.027
What was the noise?

258
00:24:38.127 --> 00:24:40.505
It was nothing.

259
00:24:40.596 --> 00:24:41.870
Okay.

260
00:24:43.232 --> 00:24:46.906
All right, well, why don't you go get ready,
because we have an earlier reservation.


261
00:24:47.002 --> 00:24:48.379
Okay.

262
00:24:50.272 --> 00:24:52.183
Are you sure you're okay?

263
00:24:52.274 --> 00:24:54.117
Yeah. Yes.

264
00:24:55.711 --> 00:24:57.190
I'll go get dressed.

265
00:24:57.279 --> 00:24:58.349
Okay.

266
00:25:19.168 --> 00:25:23.681
So, everything's booked, set up
at the hotel for all the wedding guests.


267
00:25:25.507 --> 00:25:28.181
You know, I was also thinking that...

268
00:25:31.780 --> 00:25:32.918
Hey?

269
00:25:33.015 --> 00:25:34.187
What?

270
00:25:36.752 --> 00:25:39.824
I can't help but feel like
I'm dining alone here.


271
00:25:43.859 --> 00:25:46.305
I'm sorry.

272
00:25:46.395 --> 00:25:49.433
I've just been really overwhelmed lately.

273
00:25:58.741 --> 00:26:01.221
You know, it was...

274
00:26:01.310 --> 00:26:04.689
only a one-time thing, right?

275
00:26:04.780 --> 00:26:07.727
I hate that you found her card
before I could tell you.


276
00:26:07.816 --> 00:26:09.318
It almost ruined us.

277
00:26:12.755 --> 00:26:16.168
Every single day,

278
00:26:16.258 --> 00:26:17.794
I am thankful for...

279
00:26:19.561 --> 00:26:21.666
I mean, you gave me a second chance.

280
00:26:23.132 --> 00:26:27.770
If you're having second thoughts
or doubts, just tell me.


281
00:26:27.870 --> 00:26:29.474
No.

282
00:26:29.571 --> 00:26:31.551
No, absolutely not.

283
00:26:32.908 --> 00:26:36.446
There is no one in this world
that I love more than you.


284
00:26:36.545 --> 00:26:39.048
And I'm so sorry

285
00:26:39.148 --> 00:26:42.288
if I've been distracted this past week.

286
00:26:43.318 --> 00:26:44.558
It's not you.

287
00:26:46.488 --> 00:26:48.468
It's the wedding.

288
00:26:48.557 --> 00:26:51.834
I mean, I don't know
how people go through this process


289
00:26:51.927 --> 00:26:54.168
and still stay together, but...

290
00:26:56.298 --> 00:26:58.175
I love you.

291
00:26:58.267 --> 00:26:59.803
And I'm excited.

292
00:27:01.103 --> 00:27:02.912
I love you.

293
00:28:09.772 --> 00:28:12.309
All right, rise and shine.

294
00:28:12.407 --> 00:28:14.478
You can't sleep the day away, babe.

295
00:28:17.112 --> 00:28:18.614
So, you're gonna be like that, are you?

296
00:28:19.948 --> 00:28:21.723
Are you all right?

297
00:28:21.817 --> 00:28:23.797
Yeah.

298
00:28:23.886 --> 00:28:26.127
I just... I had a bad dream.

299
00:28:26.221 --> 00:28:27.461
Okay.

300
00:28:31.160 --> 00:28:33.800
You expecting someone this early?

301
00:28:33.896 --> 00:28:35.204
No.

302
00:28:36.799 --> 00:28:40.246
No. You just go get dressed,
and I'll get the door.


303
00:28:45.574 --> 00:28:47.918
Well, whoever it is,
they are awfully persistent.


304
00:28:49.845 --> 00:28:51.882
All right, I'm coming.

305
00:28:56.652 --> 00:28:57.926
Hello, Debra.

306
00:28:58.020 --> 00:29:00.330
Hey. Tara! Tara!

307
00:29:00.422 --> 00:29:02.299
Please, come on in.

308
00:29:04.026 --> 00:29:05.266
Tara.

309
00:29:05.360 --> 00:29:07.362
Hey, come on, girl, get dressed.
We gotta go.


310
00:29:07.462 --> 00:29:08.736
What are you talking about?

311
00:29:08.831 --> 00:29:10.401
Our spa day, remember?

312
00:29:10.499 --> 00:29:11.910
- Shit.
- Yeah.


313
00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:14.105
No, I can't. I've got
an appointment this morning.


314
00:29:14.203 --> 00:29:15.648
With who?

315
00:29:15.737 --> 00:29:16.909
No one. I just, I have...

316
00:29:17.005 --> 00:29:19.508
Okay, well, you're gonna have to cancel.

317
00:29:19.608 --> 00:29:22.145
Well, that does not sound like
anything I want to be a part of,


318
00:29:22.244 --> 00:29:24.815
but have fun, love you.

319
00:29:24.913 --> 00:29:27.052
- Debra.
- Bye.


320
00:29:27.149 --> 00:29:29.026
What are you doing? Get dressed.

321
00:29:29.117 --> 00:29:31.859
All right, just...

322
00:29:31.954 --> 00:29:34.059
- Five minutes.
- Okay.


323
00:30:10.158 --> 00:30:11.569
You came.

324
00:30:12.661 --> 00:30:13.867
Of course I did.

325
00:30:16.698 --> 00:30:18.177
Before you say anything...

326
00:30:20.936 --> 00:30:23.678
I've thought a lot about what you said.

327
00:30:27.376 --> 00:30:28.753
And you're right.

328
00:30:31.013 --> 00:30:32.424
I'm right?

329
00:30:33.448 --> 00:30:35.428
We belong together.

330
00:30:39.955 --> 00:30:42.196
I want to hear you say something.

331
00:30:45.027 --> 00:30:46.438
Anything.

332
00:30:47.796 --> 00:30:49.969
Tell me you love me.

333
00:31:00.208 --> 00:31:02.654
With all my soul.

334
00:31:02.744 --> 00:31:05.122
More coffee?

335
00:31:05.213 --> 00:31:07.056
What?

336
00:31:07.149 --> 00:31:08.856
More coffee?

337
00:31:21.797 --> 00:31:24.334
Wait. Who were you supposed
to be meeting with this morning?


338
00:31:24.433 --> 00:31:26.470
I don't want to talk about it.

339
00:31:26.568 --> 00:31:27.808
Listen, I get it, girl.

340
00:31:27.903 --> 00:31:29.211
Weddings are really stressful.

341
00:31:29.304 --> 00:31:30.476
Do you want a Valium?

342
00:31:30.572 --> 00:31:32.609
No, no. It's not that.

343
00:31:34.676 --> 00:31:36.246
It's him.

344
00:31:36.345 --> 00:31:38.222
Who's him?

345
00:31:38.313 --> 00:31:39.883
Patrick.

346
00:31:39.982 --> 00:31:41.928
He showed up at my house.

347
00:31:44.252 --> 00:31:46.755
Wait. That guy you hooked up with
two weeks ago?


348
00:31:49.858 --> 00:31:52.702
Christ. And you were gonna meet with him?

349
00:31:52.794 --> 00:31:54.774
Yeah, to tell him to stay away.

350
00:31:54.863 --> 00:31:56.570
I can't have him showing up
at my house, Deb.


351
00:31:56.665 --> 00:31:58.008
No... Absolutely not.

352
00:31:58.100 --> 00:32:00.444
You don't go meet with him, okay?

353
00:32:00.535 --> 00:32:02.173
You have to cut him off completely.

354
00:32:02.270 --> 00:32:03.840
He'll just keep coming around.

355
00:32:03.939 --> 00:32:06.078
Trust me.

356
00:32:25.627 --> 00:32:26.731
<i>Yeah, you're probably right.</i>

357
00:32:26.828 --> 00:32:28.398
<i>Yeah, of course I'm right.</i>

358
00:32:28.497 --> 00:32:32.374
And if he comes around again, call me,
and I will take care of the little prick.


359
00:32:33.702 --> 00:32:34.942
Okay?

360
00:32:36.271 --> 00:32:38.376
Hey, come on.

361
00:32:40.809 --> 00:32:42.413
Forget about weirdo stalkers.

362
00:32:42.511 --> 00:32:44.218
It's gonna be fine.

363
00:33:08.437 --> 00:33:12.281
Hey, after the fitting, remind me to check
the flower arrangements and the cake.


364
00:33:12.374 --> 00:33:13.819
Yeah, I'm on it.

365
00:33:15.911 --> 00:33:17.185
Hi.

366
00:33:17.279 --> 00:33:18.849
Miss Bloom?

367
00:33:19.948 --> 00:33:21.450
I am so sorry.

368
00:33:21.550 --> 00:33:23.860
I just heard.

369
00:33:23.952 --> 00:33:25.226
Just heard what?

370
00:33:25.320 --> 00:33:27.061
Your fiancé or your ex,

371
00:33:27.155 --> 00:33:30.398
he called to let us know
that the wedding had been canceled.


372
00:33:32.327 --> 00:33:34.204
- We should...
- No, no, no.


373
00:33:35.230 --> 00:33:36.573
Michael called?

374
00:33:37.499 --> 00:33:39.206
You didn't know?

375
00:33:39.301 --> 00:33:40.678
I'm so sorry.

376
00:33:40.769 --> 00:33:43.340
He said there was a change of plans.

377
00:33:43.438 --> 00:33:46.885
No, no. That's... 
That's a mistake.

378
00:33:46.975 --> 00:33:49.421
This doesn't make any sense.

379
00:33:49.511 --> 00:33:50.455
- This is...
- No.


380
00:33:50.545 --> 00:33:51.888
Men do get cold feet.

381
00:33:51.980 --> 00:33:54.017
No. That's... That's really not helping.

382
00:33:54.116 --> 00:33:55.754
Seriously.

383
00:33:55.851 --> 00:33:56.829
This makes no sense.

384
00:33:56.918 --> 00:33:58.795
No, Michael wouldn't do this.

385
00:34:01.456 --> 00:34:04.562
Yes, I understand
we will have to forfeit the deposit.


386
00:34:05.994 --> 00:34:08.474
Yes, I guess some things
just weren't meant to be.


387
00:34:09.831 --> 00:34:11.276
Thank you.

388
00:34:13.735 --> 00:34:15.908
Don't take any other orders
from anyone but me, please.


389
00:34:16.004 --> 00:34:17.574
No, I just told you,
the wedding is not canceled.


390
00:34:17.672 --> 00:34:20.914
Hold on. No, that wasn't my fiancé.
No, that wasn't my fiancé.


391
00:34:21.009 --> 00:34:24.422
Yes, I understand that you're confused.
I have another call.


392
00:34:25.780 --> 00:34:28.654
Yes, I understand that your time
is valuable. I'm paying for it, aren't I?


393
00:34:28.750 --> 00:34:30.661
I understand that,
but the wedding is not canceled.


394
00:34:30.752 --> 00:34:33.596
I understand that, just, can you just
please keep on with the cake?


395
00:34:33.688 --> 00:34:35.964
And I will make it worth your while.

396
00:34:36.057 --> 00:34:39.129
No, the wedding's not canceled, okay?
Just give us the flowers, please?


397
00:34:39.227 --> 00:34:40.797
Shit, that was the gardens.

398
00:34:43.098 --> 00:34:44.304
It's busy.

399
00:34:45.634 --> 00:34:49.309
I guess there's just no stopping
the hand of fate, is there?


400
00:34:51.106 --> 00:34:53.450
Well, thank you for being so kind.

401
00:34:53.542 --> 00:34:55.453
Thank you, bye.

402
00:35:07.322 --> 00:35:10.235
Hi. I need to cancel
a service for a limousine.


403
00:35:14.863 --> 00:35:16.069
Nice shot.

404
00:35:16.164 --> 00:35:17.234
You're proud, aren't you?

405
00:35:18.366 --> 00:35:20.346
Shit, it's Michael.

406
00:35:20.435 --> 00:35:22.142
Well, answer the phone.

407
00:35:24.439 --> 00:35:26.419
- Hey, babe.
- Hey.


408
00:35:26.508 --> 00:35:27.646
<i>What's up?</i>

409
00:35:27.742 --> 00:35:29.653
You sound stressed.

410
00:35:29.744 --> 00:35:32.315
<i>I've just been on the phone all day.</i>

411
00:35:32.414 --> 00:35:35.122
Well, don't you worry
because, in a couple of days,


412
00:35:35.217 --> 00:35:37.458
we're going to be a million miles away.

413
00:35:37.552 --> 00:35:40.260
Thank God.

414
00:35:40.355 --> 00:35:41.493
So...

415
00:35:41.590 --> 00:35:43.069
<i>Where are you?</i>

416
00:35:44.292 --> 00:35:46.135
I'm just... I'm with Deb.

417
00:35:46.228 --> 00:35:49.869
We're actually on our way
over to the gardens right now.


418
00:35:49.965 --> 00:35:51.501
<i>Why is that?</i>

419
00:35:52.968 --> 00:35:55.744
Just wanna make sure everything's perfect.

420
00:35:55.837 --> 00:35:59.307
Well, I cannot wait to get you
all alone on an island.


421
00:35:59.407 --> 00:36:02.320
Mikey! You're up!

422
00:36:02.410 --> 00:36:06.684
Right. All right, so, couple of hours,
I'm gonna stop by the hotel,


423
00:36:06.781 --> 00:36:10.995
make sure everything at the suite is
perfect for when your folks arrive.


424
00:36:11.086 --> 00:36:13.327
Okay. I love you.

425
00:36:13.421 --> 00:36:16.700
I love you too. 
I'll see you tonight.

426
00:36:19.227 --> 00:36:22.000
It's okay, we can play in the dark.
No big deal.


427
00:36:22.097 --> 00:36:25.240
- I brought the glow-in-the-dark balls.
- You brought the glowing balls?


428
00:36:25.333 --> 00:36:26.403
All right.

429
00:36:31.906 --> 00:36:33.544
You all right?

430
00:36:46.855 --> 00:36:48.163
Hi.

431
00:36:48.256 --> 00:36:49.234
Miss Bloom.

432
00:36:49.324 --> 00:36:52.739
I've been trying to reach you
for the last, like, hour.


433
00:36:52.827 --> 00:36:54.568
Are you fucking kidding me?

434
00:36:57.065 --> 00:36:58.601
- Did I?
- Yeah.


435
00:36:58.700 --> 00:37:01.146
I hope I didn't cause you any distress.

436
00:37:01.236 --> 00:37:03.409
The garden... you didn't give it away,
did you?


437
00:37:03.505 --> 00:37:06.418
No. I was just getting ready
to call you back.


438
00:37:06.508 --> 00:37:07.919
Great.

439
00:37:08.009 --> 00:37:10.353
The man on the phone...

440
00:37:10.445 --> 00:37:13.119
sounded a bit... peculiar.

441
00:37:26.261 --> 00:37:28.070
Anything else I can get you?

442
00:37:28.163 --> 00:37:29.301
No.

443
00:37:41.476 --> 00:37:42.750
Hey, give me one of those.

444
00:37:44.012 --> 00:37:45.491
You quit.

445
00:37:46.448 --> 00:37:48.394
Just give me one.

446
00:38:00.128 --> 00:38:01.539
What do you know about this guy?

447
00:38:02.597 --> 00:38:03.701
He's psychotic.

448
00:38:06.768 --> 00:38:07.906
Yeah, but...

449
00:38:09.170 --> 00:38:12.179
Do you know his last name
or where he's from or anything?


450
00:38:12.273 --> 00:38:15.482
No. We didn't exactly
do a lot of talking.

451
00:38:17.912 --> 00:38:19.482
Well, what do you remember?

452
00:38:20.982 --> 00:38:22.086
Why?

453
00:38:23.551 --> 00:38:24.859
I know a private eye.

454
00:38:24.953 --> 00:38:26.762
He's an ex-cop.

455
00:38:28.690 --> 00:38:30.363
I think you should look into this guy.

456
00:38:32.594 --> 00:38:36.401
Look, I know he's crazy,
but do you really think that's necessary?


457
00:38:37.766 --> 00:38:39.370
Yeah.

458
00:38:39.467 --> 00:38:40.844
You don't know how crazy he is.

459
00:38:40.935 --> 00:38:42.175
I mean...

460
00:38:42.270 --> 00:38:44.181
Is he violent? 
Is he dangerous?

461
00:38:44.272 --> 00:38:46.616
Has he done this kind of shit before?

462
00:38:50.111 --> 00:38:51.749
You know?

463
00:39:00.688 --> 00:39:02.463
All right.

464
00:39:02.557 --> 00:39:05.163
But I don't want anybody
to know about this,


465
00:39:05.260 --> 00:39:06.898
and I don't want Patrick to find out

466
00:39:06.995 --> 00:39:09.066
because he'll probably take it
as some kind of encouragement.


467
00:39:10.331 --> 00:39:12.402
No, you don't have to worry.
Clay is completely discreet.


468
00:39:23.411 --> 00:39:25.721
Hey. Hey, it's Deb.

469
00:39:27.549 --> 00:39:29.551
I've got somebody I
want you to look into.

470
00:40:13.228 --> 00:40:14.673
- Hey.
- Hey.


471
00:40:15.597 --> 00:40:17.699
- How you doing?
- How you doing?


472
00:40:17.799 --> 00:40:18.834
Good.

473
00:40:20.602 --> 00:40:22.548
Clay, Tara. Tara, Clay.

474
00:40:22.637 --> 00:40:23.707
Miss Bloom. It's a pleasure.

475
00:40:23.805 --> 00:40:24.977
Hi.

476
00:40:25.073 --> 00:40:27.110
You sure know how to pick them.

477
00:40:27.208 --> 00:40:30.786
His name is Patrick Flynn, a real loon.

478
00:40:30.879 --> 00:40:33.416
Did a little digging,
pulled up quite a file on him.


479
00:40:35.750 --> 00:40:38.697
Been in and out of state custody
most of his life.


480
00:40:38.786 --> 00:40:42.598
Shrink said he was obsessive-compulsive,

481
00:40:42.690 --> 00:40:46.194
with paranoid delusions and rage issues.

482
00:40:46.294 --> 00:40:49.275
It's a total blueprint
for a psycho stalker.


483
00:40:49.364 --> 00:40:50.604
And get this...

484
00:40:50.698 --> 00:40:54.544
it seems young Patrick had quite
the crush on his babysitter.


485
00:40:54.636 --> 00:40:57.276
Or maybe it was
a little more than a crush.


486
00:40:57.372 --> 00:40:58.817
Hey, Patrick.

487
00:41:01.709 --> 00:41:03.586
Thank you.

488
00:41:03.678 --> 00:41:07.626
<i>Oddly enough, the babysitter
didn't feel the same way,</i>


489
00:41:07.715 --> 00:41:10.559
<i>and the little psycho
didn't exactly take it well.</i>


490
00:41:17.258 --> 00:41:18.464
Come on, Patrick!

491
00:41:18.560 --> 00:41:20.870
Get out! Patrick, get out!

492
00:41:20.962 --> 00:41:22.600
Go!

493
00:41:22.697 --> 00:41:27.638
The babysitter saved his life but
died a few days later from the burns.


494
00:41:28.803 --> 00:41:30.407
Jesus.

495
00:41:30.505 --> 00:41:33.179
I'd say he has a type, wouldn't you?

496
00:41:35.143 --> 00:41:38.556
He's got a half-dozen
restraining orders against him.


497
00:41:38.646 --> 00:41:40.523
Spent a couple stints in rehab,

498
00:41:40.615 --> 00:41:44.153
and most recently,
the Louisiana State Correctional System.


499
00:41:44.252 --> 00:41:45.526
What did he do?

500
00:41:45.620 --> 00:41:49.134
He stalked a nurse at the rehab because
he thought she was some kind of angel


501
00:41:49.223 --> 00:41:50.998
or some shit, thought she'd save him.

502
00:42:07.408 --> 00:42:09.115
Somebody, please help!

503
00:42:09.210 --> 00:42:10.518
Someone, help me!

504
00:42:10.612 --> 00:42:12.614
Help me! Help me!

505
00:42:12.714 --> 00:42:13.658
Someone!

506
00:42:14.949 --> 00:42:16.292
<i>Help me!</i>

507
00:42:30.898 --> 00:42:33.174
<i>He set the car on
fire with her in it?</i>

508
00:42:33.267 --> 00:42:34.610
<i>They let him walk.</i>

509
00:42:34.702 --> 00:42:36.648
<i>Didn't have enough to build a case.</i>

510
00:42:36.738 --> 00:42:39.218
Now, you can file a restraining order.

511
00:42:39.307 --> 00:42:41.150
Won't really help.

512
00:42:41.242 --> 00:42:44.746
Most stalkers are long gone
by the time the police arrive.


513
00:42:44.846 --> 00:42:48.589
A creep like this won't stop
unless... you make him stop.


514
00:42:48.683 --> 00:42:50.720
You know he's going to show up again.

515
00:42:52.153 --> 00:42:53.757
What are we going
to do when he does?

516
00:42:53.855 --> 00:42:55.562
You aren't going to do anything.

517
00:42:55.657 --> 00:42:57.898
Let me handle this prick.

518
00:43:00.294 --> 00:43:01.671
Yeah.

519
00:43:01.763 --> 00:43:03.140
- Yeah?
- Yeah.


520
00:43:03.231 --> 00:43:04.301
Let's do it.

521
00:43:04.399 --> 00:43:05.639
Okay.

522
00:44:44.866 --> 00:44:47.779
Whoa... I'm sorry.

523
00:44:47.869 --> 00:44:49.246
- Sorry.
- I'm sorry.


524
00:44:49.337 --> 00:44:51.044
- I didn't see you there.
- Yeah.


525
00:44:51.139 --> 00:44:52.277
Are you okay? I'm sorry.

526
00:44:52.373 --> 00:44:54.512
- Yeah, I think so.
- I didn't see you either.


527
00:45:02.884 --> 00:45:04.727
It's fascinating.

528
00:45:08.156 --> 00:45:09.464
Do you mind if I walk with you?

529
00:45:09.557 --> 00:45:11.036
Yeah, sure.

530
00:45:19.167 --> 00:45:21.044
Do you ride?

531
00:45:22.303 --> 00:45:24.010
No, not yet.

532
00:45:25.673 --> 00:45:27.482
I've been waiting for the right time.

533
00:45:29.043 --> 00:45:30.522
Maybe that's now.

534
00:45:32.280 --> 00:45:35.386
Could you point me in the right direction?

535
00:45:35.483 --> 00:45:38.157
You just book a riding lesson,

536
00:45:38.252 --> 00:45:40.027
go for a ride.

537
00:45:42.523 --> 00:45:44.525
He's a beauty.

538
00:45:44.625 --> 00:45:45.797
Is he yours?

539
00:45:45.893 --> 00:45:47.304
Yeah.

540
00:45:49.330 --> 00:45:51.606
You think I could...

541
00:45:51.699 --> 00:45:53.076
take a picture?

542
00:45:53.167 --> 00:45:54.407
Sure, I guess.

543
00:45:54.502 --> 00:45:56.277
- Both of you?
- Yeah.


544
00:46:02.043 --> 00:46:03.113
Good.

545
00:46:03.211 --> 00:46:04.519
Perfect.

546
00:46:08.883 --> 00:46:09.987
I'm Patrick.

547
00:46:10.084 --> 00:46:11.358
Emily.

548
00:46:12.920 --> 00:46:15.093
So, have you been riding a long time?

549
00:46:15.189 --> 00:46:17.100
Yeah, since I was little.

550
00:46:18.726 --> 00:46:20.501
Does anyone else in your family ride?

551
00:46:20.595 --> 00:46:21.869
No, just me.

552
00:46:23.464 --> 00:46:24.966
You have siblings?

553
00:46:25.066 --> 00:46:26.943
Yeah, I have two sisters.

554
00:46:27.034 --> 00:46:28.377
What's their names?

555
00:46:28.469 --> 00:46:30.142
Annie and Tara.

556
00:46:30.238 --> 00:46:31.581
They don't ride though.

557
00:46:32.940 --> 00:46:34.442
Tara...

558
00:46:35.576 --> 00:46:37.647
that's a...

559
00:46:37.745 --> 00:46:39.315
That's a beautiful name.

560
00:46:40.381 --> 00:46:41.655
I know a Tara.

561
00:46:41.749 --> 00:46:44.457
What's she like?

562
00:46:44.552 --> 00:46:47.761
You ask a lot of questions.

563
00:46:47.855 --> 00:46:50.062
I do, don't I?

564
00:46:50.157 --> 00:46:51.397
Let me take him from here.

565
00:46:51.492 --> 00:46:52.766
Thank you.

566
00:47:01.636 --> 00:47:03.172
You know, I have to get going.

567
00:47:03.271 --> 00:47:05.080
I'm meeting my parents.

568
00:47:07.241 --> 00:47:09.187
Well, I don't want to keep you.

569
00:47:10.478 --> 00:47:12.685
It was nice to meet you.

570
00:47:12.780 --> 00:47:14.521
You too.

571
00:47:14.615 --> 00:47:17.255
I'm sure we'll talk again.

572
00:47:17.351 --> 00:47:18.955
Soon.

573
00:48:53.381 --> 00:48:55.725
Excuse me?

574
00:48:55.816 --> 00:48:57.352
Could I have a notepad?

575
00:48:57.451 --> 00:48:59.055
Sure.

576
00:49:03.491 --> 00:49:05.061
Can I have two?

577
00:49:07.928 --> 00:49:09.407
Yes, sir.

578
00:49:10.698 --> 00:49:12.177
Why don't you take three?

579
00:49:12.266 --> 00:49:14.075
Thank you.

580
00:49:14.168 --> 00:49:16.239
Are you a member of the wedding party?

581
00:49:17.705 --> 00:49:21.613
You don't have to wait for Michael.
I can book you into your room if you like.


582
00:49:21.709 --> 00:49:24.315
No, thanks. I'll wait.

583
00:50:09.290 --> 00:50:10.496
Hi.

584
00:50:12.026 --> 00:50:14.870
I knew we'd see each other again.

585
00:50:14.962 --> 00:50:17.033
Honestly, you did not have to go
out of your way for us.


586
00:50:17.131 --> 00:50:19.270
Yeah. You are going to let me pay
for all this, right?


587
00:50:19.366 --> 00:50:22.904
Nonsense, the least I could do
is spoil my family.


588
00:50:23.003 --> 00:50:24.141
Family to be.

589
00:50:24.238 --> 00:50:25.216
Family to be.

590
00:50:25.306 --> 00:50:29.644
It's really nice to see you again,
but we were actually just leaving


591
00:50:29.743 --> 00:50:32.883
because my parents are checking in, so.

592
00:50:32.980 --> 00:50:34.288
Maybe I'll see you around.

593
00:50:35.549 --> 00:50:36.755
Who is that?

594
00:50:36.851 --> 00:50:38.125
I met him at the stables.

595
00:50:38.219 --> 00:50:40.165
- He's sexy.
- I know, right?


596
00:50:42.490 --> 00:50:45.369
Will you make sure their luggage makes it
to the rooftop suite, please?


597
00:50:45.459 --> 00:50:47.461
Oh, my God! The rooftop suite?

598
00:50:47.561 --> 00:50:48.835
This place is awesome.

599
00:50:48.929 --> 00:50:51.739
I am totally going to live
in a place like this...


600
00:50:53.134 --> 00:50:55.671
Where is my eldest?

601
00:50:55.769 --> 00:50:57.112
Has Tara gotten here yet?

602
00:50:57.204 --> 00:50:58.512
No, so...

603
00:50:58.606 --> 00:51:00.176
Michael?

604
00:51:01.642 --> 00:51:03.644
It's nice to finally meet you.

605
00:51:03.744 --> 00:51:07.487
I'm sorry. I'm afraid
you have me at a disadvantage.


606
00:51:07.581 --> 00:51:10.721
Patrick. Patrick Flynn.

607
00:51:10.818 --> 00:51:13.059
- Right.
- Tara hasn't mentioned me?


608
00:51:13.154 --> 00:51:14.792
Michael, would you mind if we head up?

609
00:51:14.889 --> 00:51:17.460
Sure. Let's make sure they get
to their room and everything's good.


610
00:51:17.558 --> 00:51:18.593
- Great, thanks.
- All right.


611
00:51:18.692 --> 00:51:20.171
I'll see you guys in a little bit.
One second.


612
00:51:20.261 --> 00:51:21.399
Thank you.

613
00:51:24.331 --> 00:51:27.938
Now, I'm sorry. 
What was this about Tara?

614
00:51:28.035 --> 00:51:29.844
The wedding, it's still going on?

615
00:51:31.172 --> 00:51:32.708
Of course it is. 
Why wouldn't it be?

616
00:51:34.041 --> 00:51:35.611
There's no problems?

617
00:51:37.711 --> 00:51:39.554
Why don't we go talk in private?

618
00:51:45.052 --> 00:51:46.963
All right.

619
00:51:47.054 --> 00:51:49.159
What exactly is this about?

620
00:51:51.592 --> 00:51:54.835
I don't think you know your fiancé
as well as you think you do.


621
00:51:56.564 --> 00:51:58.237
And why is that?

622
00:52:02.069 --> 00:52:04.276
You should ask Tara about me.

623
00:52:06.440 --> 00:52:07.441
I get it.

624
00:52:07.541 --> 00:52:12.017
You're some douchebag ex-boyfriend
here to rile me up.


625
00:52:12.112 --> 00:52:13.989
But guess what?

626
00:52:14.081 --> 00:52:16.425
Nothing is going to upset me

627
00:52:16.517 --> 00:52:18.519
before my wedding.

628
00:52:18.619 --> 00:52:20.656
- Nothing?
- Nothing.


629
00:52:20.754 --> 00:52:23.200
Nothing is going to upset you.

630
00:52:23.290 --> 00:52:24.792
Nothing.

631
00:52:27.528 --> 00:52:29.337
Well, you should ask Tara about me.

632
00:52:29.430 --> 00:52:31.034
Fuck you.

633
00:52:31.131 --> 00:52:32.769
Michael!

634
00:52:37.271 --> 00:52:40.081
I cannot believe you are
going to marry our Tara!


635
00:52:40.174 --> 00:52:41.209
Justine, I...

636
00:52:41.308 --> 00:52:42.878
Give me one second, okay?

637
00:52:52.286 --> 00:52:53.822
Hey.

638
00:52:53.921 --> 00:52:55.662
- Hey.
- Wow.


639
00:52:55.756 --> 00:52:57.895
You're a sight for sore eyes.

640
00:52:57.992 --> 00:53:00.233
Did you have a long day?

641
00:53:00.327 --> 00:53:02.568
You have no idea.

642
00:53:06.367 --> 00:53:09.814
Well, your folks are in the suite,
and your crazy girlfriend just showed up,


643
00:53:09.903 --> 00:53:12.247
so we should not keep them waiting.

644
00:53:12.339 --> 00:53:15.320
Is it too late to run away together?

645
00:53:15.409 --> 00:53:17.446
Yeah, let's go join the party.

646
00:53:17.544 --> 00:53:19.524
- Come on. Come on.
- Okay. All right.


647
00:53:25.519 --> 00:53:28.193
So...

648
00:53:28.289 --> 00:53:31.862
Why this rush job, huh?

649
00:53:31.959 --> 00:53:33.939
I have a very big day tomorrow.

650
00:53:35.396 --> 00:53:38.104
You are trying to impress a lady, no?

651
00:53:38.198 --> 00:53:39.802
Is it that obvious?

652
00:53:39.900 --> 00:53:44.745
Well, in my business, one sees
a lot of that sort of thing, no?


653
00:53:44.838 --> 00:53:46.511
You're done.

654
00:53:50.210 --> 00:53:52.622
She must be quite some lady.

655
00:53:54.648 --> 00:53:56.150
You have no idea.

656
00:54:10.264 --> 00:54:11.675
Come on, guys. 
Can we get the picture?

657
00:54:11.765 --> 00:54:13.244
Yes.

658
00:54:27.514 --> 00:54:28.993
What is this?

659
00:54:31.085 --> 00:54:32.860
Wait. How did you get that picture?

660
00:54:32.953 --> 00:54:35.456
You have to stay away from him.

661
00:54:35.556 --> 00:54:38.196
- Why?
- Because I said so.


662
00:54:39.727 --> 00:54:41.934
Oh, my God. I get it.

663
00:54:42.029 --> 00:54:43.474
You're the Tara that Patrick knows.

664
00:54:43.564 --> 00:54:45.271
That's why he's here.

665
00:54:45.366 --> 00:54:46.845
- What?
- He's here.


666
00:54:46.934 --> 00:54:49.278
He's here at the hotel.

667
00:54:49.370 --> 00:54:50.576
Emily, listen to me.

668
00:54:50.671 --> 00:54:52.446
I need you to
stay away from him, okay?

669
00:54:52.539 --> 00:54:55.915
Really? You're the one getting married,
and I can't talk to a cute older guy?


670
00:54:56.009 --> 00:54:58.922
- You don't understand.
- Oh, yeah, I understand.


671
00:54:59.012 --> 00:55:00.582
You want all the attention for yourself.

672
00:55:00.681 --> 00:55:02.854
Emily, please. Not now.

673
00:55:02.950 --> 00:55:04.930
Okay, fine.

674
00:56:47.654 --> 00:56:49.600
Is that for me?

675
00:56:55.262 --> 00:56:57.071
Who else would it be for?

676
00:56:58.065 --> 00:57:00.045
Can I read it?

677
00:57:01.502 --> 00:57:02.947
When I'm done.

678
00:57:04.605 --> 00:57:06.846
I wanna read it now.

679
00:57:08.976 --> 00:57:11.456
When I'm done,

680
00:57:11.545 --> 00:57:14.082
you'll know how much I love you.

681
00:57:45.212 --> 00:57:46.816
You're so lucky.

682
00:57:46.914 --> 00:57:49.190
Yeah, Michael's awesome.

683
00:57:49.283 --> 00:57:50.591
And hot.

684
00:58:01.595 --> 00:58:03.905
Excuse me, everyone.

685
00:58:03.997 --> 00:58:05.874
I know we're supposed to be...

686
00:58:05.966 --> 00:58:09.038
saving the toast for the reception,

687
00:58:09.136 --> 00:58:13.083
but I want to take this moment to
officially welcome Michael into the family.


688
00:58:23.050 --> 00:58:25.496
I'm sorry that your own parents
can't be with us.


689
00:58:29.356 --> 00:58:32.360
But I know they'd be really proud of you
and all your accomplishments.


690
00:58:32.459 --> 00:58:33.403
Thank you, Jack.

691
00:58:36.396 --> 00:58:37.704
To Michael.

692
00:58:42.302 --> 00:58:45.943
No one could love our daughter
any more than you.


693
00:58:46.039 --> 00:58:47.416
Cheers.

694
00:59:00.053 --> 00:59:01.623
All right.

695
01:00:10.590 --> 01:00:13.469
Thank you so much for taking care
of my parents like that.


696
01:00:13.560 --> 01:00:16.439
Well, they are my parents, too.

697
01:00:20.200 --> 01:00:23.238
This is the last time I'm going to see you
before the wedding.


698
01:00:24.171 --> 01:00:25.946
I know, gosh.

699
01:00:26.039 --> 01:00:28.610
That reminds me, 
I need to write my vows.

700
01:00:28.709 --> 01:00:29.847
You haven't done that yet?

701
01:00:29.943 --> 01:00:32.423
Well, I've been thinking about it a lot.

702
01:00:32.512 --> 01:00:33.991
Come here.

703
01:00:36.016 --> 01:00:37.859
Good night.

704
01:00:37.951 --> 01:00:39.294
Babe?

705
01:00:39.386 --> 01:00:40.524
Yeah?

706
01:00:44.157 --> 01:00:45.329
Nothing.

707
01:00:45.425 --> 01:00:46.768
Don't worry about it. It's nothing.

708
01:00:46.860 --> 01:00:48.134
Forget it.

709
01:00:48.228 --> 01:00:50.504
- Done.
- Okay.


710
01:00:50.597 --> 01:00:52.235
I love you.

711
01:00:52.332 --> 01:00:53.709
Love you too.

712
01:03:03.063 --> 01:03:04.371
There you go.

713
01:03:04.464 --> 01:03:06.705
Thank you so much.

714
01:03:07.968 --> 01:03:09.709
It's so beautiful.

715
01:03:09.803 --> 01:03:11.510
I can't wait.

716
01:03:11.605 --> 01:03:13.642
You are going to look fantastic in it.

717
01:03:13.740 --> 01:03:15.344
Thank you.

718
01:03:24.918 --> 01:03:28.127
Make sure you send me a photo,
so I can put it up at the shop.


719
01:03:28.221 --> 01:03:29.393
I will, I promise.

720
01:03:34.928 --> 01:03:36.305
See you later.

721
01:03:48.808 --> 01:03:50.617
- Hey.
- Hi.


722
01:03:50.710 --> 01:03:52.121
What are you doing here?

723
01:03:54.748 --> 01:03:56.523
Well, there was just...

724
01:03:56.616 --> 01:03:58.823
something that I wanted
to talk to you about.


725
01:03:58.919 --> 01:03:59.954
Okay?

726
01:04:00.053 --> 01:04:02.294
I didn't wanna bring it up
last night, but...


727
01:04:04.157 --> 01:04:05.932
What is it?

728
01:04:09.396 --> 01:04:11.273
That the wedding dress, huh?

729
01:04:11.364 --> 01:04:12.843
Yeah.

730
01:04:16.303 --> 01:04:19.978
You know what? It's nothing.

731
01:04:20.073 --> 01:04:22.883
Really, I mean, 
I shouldn't...

732
01:04:22.976 --> 01:04:24.614
Michael, wait.

733
01:04:27.781 --> 01:04:29.692
There's something you should know.

734
01:04:31.084 --> 01:04:32.563
And... I don't know how to...

735
01:04:32.652 --> 01:04:33.756
Don't.

736
01:04:34.888 --> 01:04:36.925
Just don't.

737
01:04:37.023 --> 01:04:40.527
I've done some things
that I'm not proud of,


738
01:04:40.627 --> 01:04:43.267
and if you have too,

739
01:04:43.363 --> 01:04:45.570
it doesn't matter.

740
01:04:45.665 --> 01:04:47.474
This matters.

741
01:04:49.803 --> 01:04:51.544
Tomorrow...

742
01:04:52.906 --> 01:04:54.476
Tomorrow's a new day

743
01:04:54.574 --> 01:04:57.714
and a clean slate, all right?

744
01:04:58.778 --> 01:04:59.722
Okay.

745
01:04:59.813 --> 01:05:01.383
Come here.

746
01:05:08.355 --> 01:05:09.857
I love you.

747
01:05:09.956 --> 01:05:11.367
I love you.

748
01:05:14.294 --> 01:05:15.432
All right.

749
01:06:45.418 --> 01:06:47.523
<i>Tomorrow's the big day.</i>

750
01:08:19.846 --> 01:08:21.416
Champagne?

751
01:08:29.155 --> 01:08:30.327
How do I look?

752
01:08:30.423 --> 01:08:33.632
- Gorgeous.
- You look beautiful.


753
01:08:35.461 --> 01:08:36.906
Are you ready?

754
01:08:38.631 --> 01:08:40.577
Yes.

755
01:08:40.667 --> 01:08:42.669
Okay, I'm gonna let everybody know.

756
01:08:42.769 --> 01:08:43.873
Okay.

757
01:08:52.078 --> 01:08:53.887
Hello.

758
01:08:53.980 --> 01:08:57.120
You two are just as beautiful
as the bride.


759
01:08:58.618 --> 01:09:01.224
I was surprised to see you
the other night in the lobby.


760
01:09:03.256 --> 01:09:04.735
I'm just 14.

761
01:09:04.824 --> 01:09:06.667
Well, I won't tell if you won't.

762
01:09:08.895 --> 01:09:11.273
So, how do you know Tara?

763
01:09:11.364 --> 01:09:13.810
We're close.

764
01:09:13.900 --> 01:09:17.370
That's really weird because she's
never mentioned you until last night.


765
01:09:19.105 --> 01:09:21.085
Hey, we're gonna start soon.

766
01:09:21.174 --> 01:09:22.380
- Okay.
- Okay.


767
01:09:22.475 --> 01:09:24.785
- You look so beautiful.
- Thank you.


768
01:09:30.149 --> 01:09:31.594
Hey, everybody, we're gonna start soon,

769
01:09:31.684 --> 01:09:34.460
if you guys want to go ahead
and take your seats.


770
01:09:34.554 --> 01:09:37.034
We're gonna start if you guys
want to head over to your seats.


771
01:09:38.057 --> 01:09:40.196
So, how did you meet Tara?

772
01:09:40.293 --> 01:09:41.533
Well, it's funny you should ask.

773
01:09:41.628 --> 01:09:43.232
- I'd like to just...
- Patrick, hey!


774
01:09:43.329 --> 01:09:44.899
I'm so glad you could make it.

775
01:09:44.998 --> 01:09:47.604
You guys don't mind if I borrow him
for a second, do you?


776
01:09:47.700 --> 01:09:49.475
Tara wants to talk to you.

777
01:09:53.306 --> 01:09:55.047
So you know? About us?

778
01:09:55.141 --> 01:09:56.677
Yeah, she told me everything.

779
01:09:58.011 --> 01:09:59.422
So she's finally accepting.

780
01:10:01.381 --> 01:10:03.156
- Well, we're meant to be.
- Yeah.


781
01:10:03.249 --> 01:10:04.922
You know, I know something else, too.

782
01:10:05.018 --> 01:10:06.929
Your babysitter's
not gonna save you this time.


783
01:10:10.123 --> 01:10:11.431
Fuck him up.

784
01:10:31.210 --> 01:10:35.489
Friends and family,
we are gathered here today


785
01:10:35.581 --> 01:10:39.085
not to witness a beginning
of what will be,


786
01:10:39.185 --> 01:10:41.222
because it already is.

787
01:10:45.391 --> 01:10:48.270
Just help celebrate
with Tara and Michael...


788
01:10:50.430 --> 01:10:53.639
the wondrous and joyful feelings

789
01:10:53.733 --> 01:10:55.735
that they have in their hearts
for one another.


790
01:10:55.835 --> 01:10:58.076
You may now kiss the bride.

791
01:12:24.290 --> 01:12:26.463
Easy there, cutie. Here.

792
01:12:30.563 --> 01:12:35.377
- I can carry you. Whoa. You okay?
- I'm fine. Keep your paws to yourself.


793
01:12:35.468 --> 01:12:36.469
I'm going to bed.

794
01:12:36.569 --> 01:12:37.741
Okay, have a good night.

795
01:12:37.837 --> 01:12:38.872
You too.

796
01:12:57.957 --> 01:12:59.903
I have a few questions for you.

797
01:12:59.992 --> 01:13:00.997
No!

798
01:13:10.536 --> 01:13:12.311
Thanks, Deb.

799
01:13:13.372 --> 01:13:15.477
For letting me use your place.

800
01:13:20.913 --> 01:13:22.358
I got everything I need.

801
01:13:34.126 --> 01:13:35.730
You want a chip?

802
01:14:01.554 --> 01:14:03.693
So, how is everything?

803
01:14:03.789 --> 01:14:05.200
It's wonderful.

804
01:14:05.291 --> 01:14:06.361
Everything is fantastic.

805
01:14:06.459 --> 01:14:08.063
That's good.

806
01:14:08.160 --> 01:14:09.935
Is there anything else
I can get for you?

807
01:14:10.029 --> 01:14:12.134
No, I think...

808
01:14:12.231 --> 01:14:13.733
I think we should
be good for the night.

809
01:14:13.833 --> 01:14:15.039
Good, good.

810
01:14:15.134 --> 01:14:17.910
We've had a few cancellations,

811
01:14:18.004 --> 01:14:20.678
so I'll send the rest of the staff
home for the night.


812
01:14:20.773 --> 01:14:22.116
Besides me,

813
01:14:22.208 --> 01:14:25.212
you have the entire place to yourselves.

814
01:14:25.311 --> 01:14:27.757
- All right.
- You two enjoy your evening.


815
01:14:27.847 --> 01:14:31.226
We will have some fresh food
set out for you after sunrise.


816
01:14:31.317 --> 01:14:32.625
Thank you.

817
01:14:32.718 --> 01:14:35.096
- Good night.
- Good night.


818
01:14:35.187 --> 01:14:36.791
Alone.

819
01:15:08.788 --> 01:15:10.233
<i>This is Monica Lady Ace.</i>

820
01:15:10.323 --> 01:15:12.826
<i>Here are details for broadcast times</i>

821
01:15:12.925 --> 01:15:16.134
<i>for our marine weather forecast bulletin.</i>

822
01:15:29.508 --> 01:15:30.919
Not again.

823
01:16:11.450 --> 01:16:13.225
What the fuck?

824
01:16:30.603 --> 01:16:33.675
So, can you finally relax?

825
01:16:33.773 --> 01:16:35.252
Yes.

826
01:16:37.009 --> 01:16:38.386
Good.

827
01:16:44.050 --> 01:16:46.929
I'm thinking that we just stay here.

828
01:16:47.019 --> 01:16:48.794
- Forever?
- Forever.


829
01:16:48.888 --> 01:16:50.993
- And ever.
- And ever.


830
01:16:51.090 --> 01:16:52.433
And ever.

831
01:16:56.862 --> 01:16:58.136
Oh, no.

832
01:16:58.230 --> 01:16:59.402
No.

833
01:16:59.498 --> 01:17:01.500
That's not good.

834
01:17:01.600 --> 01:17:02.977
All right.

835
01:17:03.069 --> 01:17:04.275
I'm gonna grab some wine.

836
01:17:04.370 --> 01:17:07.408
- Okay.
- Do you need anything from the...


837
01:17:07.506 --> 01:17:09.179
Can you bring my sweater?

838
01:17:09.275 --> 01:17:10.413
Yes.

839
01:17:16.782 --> 01:17:18.056
All right.

840
01:17:32.498 --> 01:17:33.977
You!

841
01:19:12.464 --> 01:19:14.341
Oh, God!

842
01:19:29.415 --> 01:19:30.758
It fits.

843
01:19:56.575 --> 01:19:58.145
Thank you.

844
01:19:59.411 --> 01:20:02.392
Isn't it just so beautiful here?

845
01:20:02.481 --> 01:20:03.858
Let's never leave.

846
01:20:05.184 --> 01:20:07.664
Michael! Michael!

847
01:20:07.753 --> 01:20:09.391
Hey...

848
01:20:15.127 --> 01:20:16.834
Where's my husband?

849
01:20:18.464 --> 01:20:19.807
I'm right here.

850
01:20:22.968 --> 01:20:24.641
You're fucking crazy.

851
01:20:27.406 --> 01:20:30.250
Don't be like that.

852
01:20:30.342 --> 01:20:31.753
Come on.

853
01:20:34.580 --> 01:20:36.116
You're sick.

854
01:20:40.319 --> 01:20:43.766
You... hurt me.

855
01:20:48.861 --> 01:20:50.465
Michael's gone.

856
01:20:54.900 --> 01:20:56.971
You should have saved me.

857
01:21:00.005 --> 01:21:01.814
That's all I needed.

858
01:21:04.843 --> 01:21:06.151
Please, Patrick.

859
01:21:06.245 --> 01:21:07.485
Don't.

860
01:21:07.579 --> 01:21:09.320
Please.

861
01:21:09.415 --> 01:21:10.655
Please.

862
01:21:12.918 --> 01:21:13.953
Please.

863
01:21:15.654 --> 01:21:17.634
- You brought this on yourself.
- No!


864
01:21:32.071 --> 01:21:33.015
Oh, my God.

865
01:21:33.105 --> 01:21:34.379
Michael.

866
01:21:34.473 --> 01:21:36.578
It was... him.

867
01:21:38.043 --> 01:21:38.987
Oh, my God.

868
01:21:39.078 --> 01:21:40.580
Come here. Come here.

869
01:21:45.117 --> 01:21:47.688
Give me your hand. 
Give me your hand.

870
01:21:49.722 --> 01:21:50.757
I'm sorry.

871
01:21:50.856 --> 01:21:52.267
I'm sorry.

872
01:21:54.493 --> 01:21:55.597
Honey, I need you to get up.

873
01:21:55.694 --> 01:21:57.037
Get up. Michael, get up.

874
01:21:57.129 --> 01:21:58.540
Please.

875
01:22:04.903 --> 01:22:06.678
No, no! No!

876
01:22:09.508 --> 01:22:11.283
I've got... I've got you.

877
01:22:20.119 --> 01:22:21.189
Come on. Come on.

878
01:22:21.286 --> 01:22:23.027
Come on.

879
01:22:40.606 --> 01:22:41.607
No.

880
01:22:42.908 --> 01:22:43.978
Michael.

881
01:22:49.715 --> 01:22:50.785
You have to go get help.

882
01:22:50.883 --> 01:22:52.123
No, I'm not leaving you.

883
01:22:52.217 --> 01:22:54.356
You have to. You have to go.

884
01:22:54.453 --> 01:22:56.126
No. If I leave, he'll kill you.

885
01:22:56.221 --> 01:22:58.360
He's gonna kill us both.

886
01:22:58.457 --> 01:23:01.097
Please, I can't let you die.

887
01:23:01.193 --> 01:23:03.264
- So just... go.
- No.


888
01:23:03.362 --> 01:23:04.500
Go.

889
01:23:10.969 --> 01:23:12.573
Tara?

890
01:23:14.440 --> 01:23:16.078
Sweetheart?

891
01:23:21.513 --> 01:23:23.083
Come on, honey.

892
01:23:26.085 --> 01:23:27.564
Let's talk.

893
01:24:22.741 --> 01:24:25.187
I almost feel sorry for you.

894
01:24:32.217 --> 01:24:34.219
But you can't stop the hand of fate.

895
01:24:39.358 --> 01:24:41.099
Where's our girl now?

896
01:24:46.465 --> 01:24:48.945
Till death do you part, huh?

897
01:24:50.002 --> 01:24:52.573
- You ready?
- Are you?


898
01:26:19.691 --> 01:26:21.568
I'm so sorry.

899
01:26:26.031 --> 01:26:27.874
I was just looking for you.

900
01:26:31.370 --> 01:26:33.782
You really should be in bed, resting.

901
01:26:33.872 --> 01:26:35.249
I'm fine.

902
01:26:36.908 --> 01:26:38.649
How is he?

903
01:26:38.744 --> 01:26:40.690
Your husband's coming along.

904
01:26:40.779 --> 01:26:42.486
He lost a lot of blood, but...

905
01:26:42.581 --> 01:26:44.026
he should be just fine.

906
01:26:45.617 --> 01:26:48.996
The two of you are really very lucky.

907
01:26:49.087 --> 01:26:50.896
And in your condition...

908
01:26:52.791 --> 01:26:53.963
Condition?

909
01:26:54.993 --> 01:26:56.529
You don't know?

910
01:26:57.596 --> 01:26:59.234
You're pregnant.

911
01:27:00.132 --> 01:27:01.634
Congratulations.
