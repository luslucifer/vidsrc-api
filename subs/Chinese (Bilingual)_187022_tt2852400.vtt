不要净想着发财
There's more to life than getting rich.


270
00:24:47.428 --> 00:24:49.863
你能比上人家焦胜利万恶了？
You want to be worse than Jiao Shengli?

嗐，不要想那些了
Enough complaining.

If you have time and money, open a restaurant or a store.


280
00:25:19.514 --> 00:25:23.298
或是弄个商店，挣了些钱，娶个媳妇
To make money and get married.


281
00:25:23.865 --> 00:25:26.908

那么，一个人三根，分了

你们要怪，就怪老天爷
The gods are for blaming.


452
00:48:32.515 --> 00:48:35.132

她原来不是在台湾厂里干吗？

You're frowning.


547
01:04:02.293 --> 01:04:03.773
嗯嗯……

548

一会儿怎么走？

01:04:50.369 --> 01:04:51.592
没说通
I left it implicit.


558
01:04:55.704 --> 01:04:57.045
你就拖吧
You're stalling again.


559
01:05:03.318 --> 01:05:04.646

我不给我自己一个交代
I accepted things the way they were.


563
01:05:31.194 --> 01:05:32.970
我还得给我爸妈一个交代

564
01:05:56.668 --> 01:05:58.002
我想要个孩子

565
01:06:06.710 --> 01:06:08.223
一起回广州吧
Let's go together to Guangzhou.


566
01:06:20.415 --> 01:06:23.624

567
01:06:24.958 --> 01:06:28.375
要么你离，我们好好过
or you leave her and live with me.


568
01:06:30.936 --> 01:06:32.270
不能再拖了
