- [Sal] Sixty.
- Sixty kilos?

Eight big ones a kilo, right?

What's the hurry?


620
00:54:12.374 --> 00:54:14.291
He could see a couple of shows...

One thing I learned-

Move calmly, move cautiously.
You'll never be sorry.

Aah. Look, I'm telling you,
he'll take the deal somewhere else.


629
00:54:40.318 --> 00:54:42.737
So let him take his 60 kilos
of heroin someplace else...


630
00:54:42.821 --> 00:54:45.656
and find how easy it is
to put together a half a million in cash.
