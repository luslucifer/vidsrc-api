00:00:39.793 --> 00:00:43.282
<i>Take for instance last week.
A woman's going to visit her mother.</i>


2
00:00:44.693 --> 00:00:47.125
<i>She has a bag of groceries
and a bouquet of flowers..</i>


3
00:00:47.327 --> 00:00:48.724
<i>to brighten up the place.</i>

4
00:00:48.927 --> 00:00:50.450
Mom.

5
00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:54.739
Mom? Mom?

6
00:00:57.593 --> 00:00:58.820
<i>What she doesn't know is..</i>

7
00:00:59.027 --> 00:01:01.891
<i>three days prior,
her mother's fallen off a footstool..</i>


8
00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:05.717
<i>busted her head open
and broken her neck.</i>


9
00:01:15.593 --> 00:01:17.786
<i>By the time she gets there,
her mother's body..</i>


10
00:01:17.993 --> 00:01:19.583
<i>is bloated with bacterial gases.</i>

11
00:01:19.793 --> 00:01:23.748
<i>There's fluids leaking from
her eyes, ears, nose, mouth.</i>


12
00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:26.119
<i>You get the picture.</i>

13
00:01:27.394 --> 00:01:30.189
<i>Well, death is tragic.</i>

14
00:01:31.493 --> 00:01:34.358
<i>But it's also big business.</i>

15
00:01:45.427 --> 00:01:47.892
<i>Some people deal with it spiritually.</i>

16
00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:52.249
<i>Others deal with it legally.</i>

17
00:01:52.459 --> 00:01:54.755
<i>But what most people don't know..</i>

18
00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.119
<i>is that when someone dies
in your house..</i>


19
00:01:57.327 --> 00:02:00.293
<i>it's up to you
to clean up the mess.</i>


20
00:02:00.893 --> 00:02:04.326
<i>Well, sure, the city will come
and take the body away.</i>


21
00:02:04.526 --> 00:02:06.390
<i>But what they leave behind..</i>

22
00:02:06.593 --> 00:02:09.424
<i>is your own
personal little souvenir.</i>


23
00:02:09.626 --> 00:02:12.990
<i>Now, most people
don't have the stomach for that.</i>


24
00:02:13.193 --> 00:02:15.522
<i>That's where I come in.</i>

25
00:02:20.127 --> 00:02:22.524
<i>Now, cleaning a body is..</i>

26
00:02:22.726 --> 00:02:26.352
<i>actually a lot like cleaning
any other household spill.</i>


27
00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:29.254
<i>There are three basic steps.</i>

28
00:02:30.193 --> 00:02:33.454
<i>First, get rid of all the bugs.</i>

29
00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:40.417
<i>HIV, herpes, tuberculosis,
adenovirus, hantavirus, E. coli.</i>


30
00:02:40.626 --> 00:02:44.059
<i>Now, I assume all those things
are present, so I spray everything..</i>


31
00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:49.386
<i>with my own personal little cocktail
of antivirals and disinfectants.</i>


32
00:02:50.127 --> 00:02:53.889
<i>And just between you and me,
I also throw in a little Listerine.</i>


33
00:02:54.093 --> 00:02:55.718
<i>The original flavor.</i>

34
00:02:55.927 --> 00:02:59.723
<i>It has an enzyme
that liquefies coagulated blood.</i>


35
00:02:59.927 --> 00:03:04.053
You gotta use the original flavor,
not that new blue or orange shit.


36
00:03:05.693 --> 00:03:07.216
Well..

37
00:03:07.826 --> 00:03:11.519
Tom, that's..
I.. I mean..


38
00:03:12.426 --> 00:03:13.414
I'll be right back.

39
00:03:16.927 --> 00:03:20.415
- Didn't you use to be a cop?
- Yeah. Yep, I did.


40
00:03:20.893 --> 00:03:22.950
Didn't have the stomach for it.

41
00:03:26.927 --> 00:03:29.620
So, Jeff.
Well, what's going on with you?


42
00:03:29.826 --> 00:03:32.690
Well, I'm still in the mortgage game.

43
00:03:33.294 --> 00:03:34.452
Doing good there.

44
00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:38.353
Of course, there's Laura and the kids,
all great.


45
00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:42.492
Laura's mom, she's getting up there.
She's been sick.


46
00:03:42.693 --> 00:03:44.750
She's staying with us now
in the back bedroom.


47
00:03:45.426 --> 00:03:48.449
There's some days
she doesn't come out of there at all.


48
00:03:50.193 --> 00:03:52.954
Tom, you wouldn't happen
to have a card on you, would you?


49
00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:57.751
Oh, yeah, sure. Sure. Yeah.
Here you go.


50
00:03:57.960 --> 00:03:59.949
- Can I have one?
- Oh, yeah, definitely.


51
00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:02.990
There's enough here for everybody.
Yep, this is good. Call me.


52
00:04:03.193 --> 00:04:07.125
That's Steri-Clean. That's me.
Gee, it's great to see y'all.


53
00:04:10.426 --> 00:04:12.722
<i>Quit stalling. Get the typewriter.
Pound out a lead.</i>


54
00:04:12.927 --> 00:04:14.722
<i>- How much do you want?
- All you got.</i>


55
00:04:14.927 --> 00:04:16.552
<i>Hello, give me Duffy.</i>

56
00:04:17.294 --> 00:04:18.691
<i>- Call the mayor a bird of prey?
- Anything.</i>


57
00:04:18.893 --> 00:04:20.722
<i>How about the time
he had his house painted?</i>


58
00:04:20.927 --> 00:04:23.358
<i>Give him the works.
Hello, Duffy? Get set.</i>


59
00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:26.424
<i>We got the biggest story in years.
"Earl Williams.."</i>


60
00:04:26.626 --> 00:04:27.922
How was it?

61
00:04:28.127 --> 00:04:30.184
It was..

62
00:04:32.293 --> 00:04:33.691
funny.

63
00:04:33.893 --> 00:04:38.121
- Funny how?
- Oh, you'll see in about 30 years.


64
00:04:38.326 --> 00:04:39.952
Rekindle any old flames?

65
00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:44.387
No, baby.
That candle burned out years ago.


66
00:04:46.459 --> 00:04:51.357
- I'm beat. I'm going to bed.
- Good night.


67
00:04:51.826 --> 00:04:53.792
You're gonna stay up
and watch this movie..


68
00:04:53.993 --> 00:04:55.356
with these people talking like:

69
00:04:57.227 --> 00:05:00.886
- Yeah. I wanna see how it ends.
- All right.


70
00:05:01.093 --> 00:05:03.456
Rose, I'll love you
until the end of time..


71
00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:07.888
because you're the girl I've wanted,
and you're the girl of my dreams.


72
00:05:08.093 --> 00:05:09.888
Love you, baby.

73
00:05:10.293 --> 00:05:11.919
<i>- Is she there?
- No, I can't hear you.</i>


74
00:05:12.127 --> 00:05:13.888
<i>- Where'd she go?
- Out someplace.</i>


75
00:05:43.927 --> 00:05:46.552
Last night..
Last night I dreamed I was..


76
00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:49.783
changing my baby's diaper,
and it was filled with blood.


77
00:05:49.993 --> 00:05:53.356
And when I looked up, I mean,
he was fucking dead.


78
00:05:54.193 --> 00:05:56.624
You know,
and then I had to come in and..


79
00:05:58.626 --> 00:06:00.489
I had to come
in and clean the crib.

80
00:06:00.693 --> 00:06:03.591
I gotta clean it up
before the mama comes in.


81
00:06:04.027 --> 00:06:06.857
You want something? Gum, mints?

82
00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:09.026
- Aspirin?
- I could use a drink.


83
00:06:09.226 --> 00:06:11.590
How about we start with the aspirin?

84
00:06:11.793 --> 00:06:13.452
Hey, you got a little girl.

85
00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:16.251
What do you tell Rose?
What do you tell her you do?


86
00:06:16.459 --> 00:06:17.891
She knows what I do.

87
00:06:18.093 --> 00:06:21.456
There's nothing to be ashamed of.
We don't clean up blood.


88
00:06:21.660 --> 00:06:24.319
We clean up anger and grief,
heartache.


89
00:06:24.526 --> 00:06:26.321
Looks like blood.

90
00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:32.185
Just tell yourself that
our clients are in trouble.


91
00:06:33.226 --> 00:06:34.453
We help them out.

92
00:06:37.826 --> 00:06:42.349
Well, I hate to see you go, Miguel.
I don't wanna burn you out either.


93
00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:45.253
Say you come in a couple days
a week, restock the vans..


94
00:06:45.459 --> 00:06:48.357
and give Cherie a hand around here,
lighten her load, okay?


95
00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:53.187
Yeah, man. Yeah, I..
Yeah, thank you, brother.


96
00:06:53.393 --> 00:06:57.723
- Thank you, man. Look, I owe you one.
- You don't owe me shit. We all good.


97
00:06:57.927 --> 00:07:01.222
- Go spend the day with your family.
- All right.


98
00:07:06.093 --> 00:07:07.718
He quit?

99
00:07:07.927 --> 00:07:09.892
No. He's gonna help you out
around here.


100
00:07:09.893 --> 00:07:13.581
Yeah, I'll believe it when I see it.
These two are yours.


101
00:07:17.660 --> 00:07:20.387
- Forty-five cats? Give this to Paulie.
- We're short-staffed.


102
00:07:20.593 --> 00:07:24.286
Paulie's sick. Freddie and Jose are in
that meth lab in Howell. Miguel quit.


103
00:07:24.493 --> 00:07:25.618
No, he didn't quit.

104
00:07:26.393 --> 00:07:28.053
And Victor's allergic.

105
00:07:29.927 --> 00:07:34.188
- Hey, at least nobody died there.
- Probably smell better.


106
00:07:34.393 --> 00:07:36.188
Good morning, Steri
-Clean.

107
00:07:40.060 --> 00:07:41.457
Please hold. Lorenzo's on 2.

108
00:07:41.660 --> 00:07:43.216
- I'm in the field.
- Again?


109
00:07:43.426 --> 00:07:45.187
I'm in the field.

110
00:07:45.393 --> 00:07:47.188
You're gonna have to
take it sometime.


111
00:07:48.927 --> 00:07:50.415
Okay.

112
00:07:50.626 --> 00:07:53.114
I'm so sorry, Mr. Lorenzo.
He's in the field.


113
00:07:53.326 --> 00:07:54.349
<i>Thank you.</i>

114
00:07:57.060 --> 00:07:59.082
Can I take a message?

115
00:08:54.226 --> 00:08:57.681
Steri
-Clean. Anybody here?

116
00:09:41.459 --> 00:09:42.891
Initial recording.

117
00:09:43.092 --> 00:09:46.786
This is Tom Cutler. On April 6.

118
00:09:46.992 --> 00:09:52.857
<i>Case number three-Mary-four-four-
five-Charlie-three-seven-eight.</i>


119
00:09:53.059 --> 00:09:54.582
<i>Personal residence.</i>

120
00:09:54.793 --> 00:10:00.350
<i>Homicide. No one home.
Key was left on the front porch.</i>


121
00:10:00.560 --> 00:10:03.583
<i>Blood and tissue on the sofa..</i>

122
00:10:06.793 --> 00:10:07.951
<i>wall..</i>

123
00:10:10.992 --> 00:10:12.219
<i>tile floor..</i>

124
00:10:14.026 --> 00:10:15.549
<i>glass coffee table.</i>

125
00:10:23.959 --> 00:10:27.756
Blood, soft chip,
approximately one day old.


126
00:12:19.226 --> 00:12:20.715
Something smells good.

127
00:12:20.926 --> 00:12:23.324
- How was your day?
- Long.


128
00:12:26.426 --> 00:12:29.688
- Why is your mom's box out?
- It's a surprise.


129
00:12:41.159 --> 00:12:44.455
- Are your eyes closed?
- Yeah, they're closed.


130
00:12:44.660 --> 00:12:46.148
Okay.

131
00:12:47.693 --> 00:12:49.090
Open.

132
00:12:49.859 --> 00:12:52.189
I found the recipe in her old book.

133
00:12:52.393 --> 00:12:55.257
I can't remember,
but is this how it used to look?


134
00:12:55.459 --> 00:12:58.687
Yeah. Yeah, it's exactly
how it used to look.


135
00:12:58.892 --> 00:13:03.052
- Why'd you take the box out?
- It's.. It's interesting, actually.


136
00:13:03.259 --> 00:13:06.714
I have to do a history report on a
historical figure from the last 50 years.


137
00:13:06.926 --> 00:13:09.188
Really? So who are you doing?

138
00:13:09.992 --> 00:13:11.219
Mom.

139
00:13:11.825 --> 00:13:15.553
- Your mom's a historical figure?
- My teacher thinks it's a good idea.


140
00:13:15.760 --> 00:13:19.351
- She said it's original.
- Yeah, it's original, all right.


141
00:13:19.560 --> 00:13:23.014
- You know who would be really good?
- I kind of already started.


142
00:13:23.226 --> 00:13:25.488
Maybe if you have time later
you can help me?


143
00:13:25.693 --> 00:13:29.318
Sure, but not tonight.
I have to do payroll.


144
00:13:31.092 --> 00:13:33.058
I don't have to do Mom.

145
00:13:33.259 --> 00:13:36.623
- Who were you gonna say?
- Nobody, no. Mom's a good idea.


146
00:13:39.459 --> 00:13:41.357
I got a call
from your math teacher today.


147
00:13:42.493 --> 00:13:44.516
Says you've been sleeping in class.

148
00:13:44.726 --> 00:13:47.021
I nodded off, like, twice
because he's so boring..


149
00:13:47.226 --> 00:13:49.249
and he's making
this huge thing out of it.


150
00:13:49.459 --> 00:13:51.981
Well, bottom line is
it's gotta stop. Now.


151
00:13:52.192 --> 00:13:56.022
So no more of those mocha things
after 5 and I want you in bed by 11:30.


152
00:13:56.226 --> 00:13:57.953
We clear?

153
00:13:58.892 --> 00:14:00.324
Hey.

154
00:14:00.759 --> 00:14:03.919
I'm not punishing you, I just want you
to get your sleep, okay?


155
00:14:06.593 --> 00:14:08.820
Now, you know
if there's anything bothering you..


156
00:14:09.026 --> 00:14:10.424
I'm here for you, right?

157
00:14:10.626 --> 00:14:11.852
I know.

158
00:14:12.359 --> 00:14:14.950
- Is there?
- What?


159
00:14:15.159 --> 00:14:19.091
- Anything bothering you?
- No, it's the mochas. I'll cut back.


160
00:14:21.560 --> 00:14:25.014
One thing's for sure.
You're just as good a cook as she was.


161
00:14:48.560 --> 00:14:49.991
Dad.

162
00:14:50.792 --> 00:14:53.690
Dad. We're gonna be late.

163
00:15:32.493 --> 00:15:34.015
Come in.

164
00:15:41.659 --> 00:15:43.057
Hello.

165
00:15:43.259 --> 00:15:45.452
Surprise!

166
00:15:47.926 --> 00:15:50.790
Hang on. Hang on.
It's not him. It's not him.


167
00:15:50.992 --> 00:15:52.924
Hi. We thought you were
my little nephew..


168
00:15:53.126 --> 00:15:55.751
not that you look like
you're turning 10 today, but..


169
00:15:55.959 --> 00:15:59.050
- Can I help you?
- Yes.


170
00:16:00.092 --> 00:16:00.841
Is?

171
00:16:03.659 --> 00:16:06.285
- Is this your house?
- Yes.


172
00:16:06.493 --> 00:16:11.221
Well, I'm Tom Cutler.
I run the cleaning service you hired.


173
00:16:11.426 --> 00:16:14.392
I'm sorry. We have a housekeeper
and we're really happy with her.


174
00:16:14.592 --> 00:16:17.717
No, no, no. We're not that kind
of cleaning service.


175
00:16:17.926 --> 00:16:22.052
I was saying, we did a job here
yesterday and inadvertently we..


176
00:16:22.259 --> 00:16:24.487
Excuse me, sir.
We weren't home yesterday.


177
00:16:24.692 --> 00:16:26.954
What kind of cleaning service
are you?


178
00:16:28.359 --> 00:16:31.018
Oh, is your husband home?
Perhaps I could talk to him.


179
00:16:31.226 --> 00:16:34.192
No, he's out for the moment.
You can talk to me.


180
00:16:34.792 --> 00:16:36.520
Okay.

181
00:16:37.426 --> 00:16:39.891
We cleaned up
after what happened.


182
00:16:41.159 --> 00:16:43.057
After what happened?

183
00:16:43.259 --> 00:16:45.452
- I'm sorry, Mrs?
- Norcut.


184
00:16:46.892 --> 00:16:47.880
Norcut.

185
00:16:49.725 --> 00:16:52.419
- Not Collins?
- No.


186
00:16:53.859 --> 00:16:58.189
- Is this Ridgecrest Lane?
- Ridgewood Way.


187
00:16:58.759 --> 00:17:00.554
See. There.

188
00:17:00.759 --> 00:17:05.089
There's the mistake right there. Once
again, my office got things mixed up.


189
00:17:05.293 --> 00:17:07.225
I'm sorry to have taken your time.

190
00:17:18.493 --> 00:17:23.391
Three-Mary-four-four-
five-Charlie-three-seven-eight.


191
00:17:25.992 --> 00:17:29.685
Hey. Sign these. I'm going to Betty's.
You want anything?


192
00:17:29.892 --> 00:17:32.881
<i>I'm sorry. There are no matches
for that case number.</i>


193
00:17:33.259 --> 00:17:34.656
Who called this in?

194
00:17:34.859 --> 00:17:37.586
- West Trenton P.D.
- Who, exactly?


195
00:17:37.792 --> 00:17:39.781
<i>- Right there. Jones.
- Sir?</i>


196
00:17:40.259 --> 00:17:43.782
<i>- Detective Jones, please.
- There's no one by that name, sir.</i>


197
00:17:43.992 --> 00:17:47.651
Oh, thank you.

198
00:17:48.326 --> 00:17:53.020
- What happened? They stiff us?
- I'm just trying to sort some stuff out.


199
00:17:53.226 --> 00:17:54.555
All right.

200
00:17:54.759 --> 00:17:57.657
- What do you want from Betty's?
- I'm not hungry.


201
00:18:44.659 --> 00:18:48.682
<i>Police Commissioner Robert Vaughn
stepped down in disgrace last year..</i>


202
00:18:48.892 --> 00:18:52.052
<i>following allegations of widespread
corruption and bribery.</i>


203
00:18:52.259 --> 00:18:53.554
Earth to Dad.

<i>The grand jury is expected
to hear..</i>


205

I said, next Tuesday is
Take Your Daughter to Work Day.


206
00:18:59.425 --> 00:19:02.585
- No. Ain't gonna happen, sport.
- I'm totally joking.


207
00:19:35.959 --> 00:19:40.448
<i>Eddie Lorenzo, Line 1.
In the field again?</i>


208
00:19:44.592 --> 00:19:45.342
No.

209
00:19:46.625 --> 00:19:48.488
No, I'll take it.

210
00:20:02.159 --> 00:20:05.556
Well, it must be a full moon.

211
00:20:05.759 --> 00:20:10.317
<i>What the hell's going on, Tom?
You think I'd never find out?</i>


212
00:20:11.458 --> 00:20:14.720
Rosie makes the playoffs, I gotta
read about it in the sports section?


213
00:20:16.559 --> 00:20:17.889
<i>I'm gonna be there.</i>

214
00:20:18.092 --> 00:20:20.580
<i>- I already marked it down.
- That would be really great.</i>


215
00:20:20.792 --> 00:20:22.849
<i>- She'll appreciate that.
- If she remembers me.</i>


216
00:20:23.059 --> 00:20:24.854
<i>Of course she remembers you.</i>

217
00:20:25.059 --> 00:20:26.786
You think you'll be thirsty tonight?

218
00:20:26.992 --> 00:20:28.924
<i>Oh, I think
I can probably be persuaded.</i>


219
00:20:29.126 --> 00:20:31.455
<i>- Vic's?
- Hey, yeah, Vic's.</i>


220
00:20:31.659 --> 00:20:34.750
<i>- Eight o'clock?
- All right. Vic's at 8.</i>


221
00:20:34.959 --> 00:20:38.322
<i>- Just like old times. Excellent.
- See you there, man.</i>


222
00:20:45.059 --> 00:20:46.957
<i>She worked at a movie theater.</i>

223
00:20:47.159 --> 00:20:49.386
<i>She used to sneak me in
and we'd watch movies.</i>


224
00:20:51.226 --> 00:20:54.623
<i>Well, she'd watch them.
I'd watch her.</i>


225
00:20:56.892 --> 00:20:58.949
<i>It was a very small wedding.</i>

226
00:20:59.159 --> 00:21:03.182
<i>Just me, her, her parents,
her friend Jules, and Eddie.</i>


227
00:21:06.492 --> 00:21:08.788
<i>We went on vacation in Mexico..</i>

228
00:21:08.992 --> 00:21:12.515
<i>and nine months later,
you showed up.</i>


229
00:21:13.892 --> 00:21:16.949
<i>That's the short version,
and that's all you're getting.</i>


230
00:21:17.625 --> 00:21:19.251
How much more?

231
00:21:19.458 --> 00:21:20.856
Just a couple.

232
00:21:21.059 --> 00:21:23.650
I wanna talk a little bit
about what happened to her.


233
00:21:23.859 --> 00:21:25.086
Where'd you find that?

234
00:21:26.659 --> 00:21:30.092
It was in the box.
So, what happened to him?


235
00:21:31.525 --> 00:21:35.083
- I thought this was about your mother.
- I'm supposed to be thorough.


236
00:21:35.292 --> 00:21:36.280
He was killed, right?

237
00:21:37.525 --> 00:21:42.287
- Yes, he was killed.
- How?


238
00:21:42.492 --> 00:21:45.515
In prison, where he should have been
for what he did to her.


239
00:21:45.725 --> 00:21:46.952
I know, but how?

240
00:21:47.159 --> 00:21:49.954
I don't know, Rose. It's prison.
Prison's a dangerous place.


241
00:21:50.159 --> 00:21:53.591
Look, I really don't think you ought to
be putting all that in there.


242
00:21:58.026 --> 00:21:59.389
I'm sorry.

243
00:22:02.825 --> 00:22:04.256
Any more questions?

244
00:22:05.659 --> 00:22:09.057
That's all for now. I guess.

245
00:22:13.559 --> 00:22:15.752
I have to go out for a while.
You gonna be okay?


246
00:22:15.959 --> 00:22:18.084
Yeah, I'll be fine.

247
00:22:22.725 --> 00:22:25.691
- Yo, Vic.
- Coming up.


248
00:22:26.325 --> 00:22:29.587
- Hey, where you been hiding, Tom?
- Oh, I've been around.


249
00:22:31.792 --> 00:22:34.257
Are things as bad down there
as they say in the paper?


250
00:22:34.458 --> 00:22:38.413
Worse. Thirty-five guys filed
for early retirement this month alone.


251
00:22:38.625 --> 00:22:41.853
Everyone's afraid they're gonna find
the trail and start naming names.


252
00:22:42.059 --> 00:22:44.718
IA's everywhere.
The DA's subpoena happened.


253
00:22:44.926 --> 00:22:48.255
You brush by Robert Vaughn in
the hall, they wanna know about it.


254
00:22:48.458 --> 00:22:50.947
- You think he'll go down?
- You know how it is, Tom.


255
00:22:51.159 --> 00:22:53.954
He's got a lot of guys around,
loyal guys. He's protected.


256

<i>When she came home,
she found his clothes and car gone.</i>

<i>The police have recovered his car

<i>But security tapes show
that he never boarded a train.</i>


259
00:23:05.258 --> 00:23:06.451
Know anything about that?

260
00:23:06.659 --> 00:23:08.125
<i>Rumors of foul play..</i>

261
00:23:08.759 --> 00:23:11.554
- Yeah, that came down today.
- So, what's the story?


262
00:23:11.759 --> 00:23:14.589
No story.
Some guy skipped out on his wife.


263
00:23:14.792 --> 00:23:17.122
- Why?
- No reason.


264
00:23:17.725 --> 00:23:20.247
You better catch up.
I'm gonna kick your ass here.


265
00:23:20.458 --> 00:23:21.788
I'm still working on this.

266
00:23:21.992 --> 00:23:25.015
How am I gonna know what's on
your mind if you don't get hammered?


267
00:23:25.225 --> 00:23:28.783
You know, something happened at
work has got me a little turned around.


268
00:23:28.992 --> 00:23:31.753
Considering the work you do,
it must have been something.


269
00:23:32.225 --> 00:23:33.714
Vic. Turn that up.

270
00:23:33.926 --> 00:23:36.721
<i>- Fears for John's safety.
- Turn it up.</i>


271

<i>Thank you very much.</i>

274
00:23:43.092 --> 00:23:44.455
Can I have your autograph?

275
00:23:44.659 --> 00:23:47.716
Man, I spoke to that asshole
for 15 minutes, man.


276
00:23:51.525 --> 00:23:54.787
Holy shit. Here he comes, Tommy.

277
00:23:54.992 --> 00:23:57.514
- Tom Cutler.
- Jim Vargas.


278
00:23:57.725 --> 00:23:59.816
- Hey.
- Holy shit. How you doing?


279
00:24:00.026 --> 00:24:02.719
- Good, man, good.
- Good to see you.


280
00:24:02.926 --> 00:24:06.653
Lorenzo.
Regular class reunion, huh?


281
00:24:06.859 --> 00:24:09.222
Hey, somebody told me
you're cleaning up stiffs?


282
00:24:09.425 --> 00:24:11.482
- That's right.
- No shit.


283
00:24:11.692 --> 00:24:13.590
Man, I thought
they were yanking my chain.


284
00:24:13.792 --> 00:24:15.257
Of all the crazy rackets, huh?

285
00:24:15.458 --> 00:24:17.424
Hey, we can't all be TV stars
like you, Jim.


286
00:24:17.625 --> 00:24:19.853
- Come on.
- When you go to Missing Persons?


287
00:24:20.892 --> 00:24:24.119
Missing Persons?
I'm Homicide, baby.


288
00:24:24.325 --> 00:24:27.689
Oh, that. That's for the press, man.
Fuck the press.


289
00:24:27.892 --> 00:24:30.323
Technically,
it's a missing persons case.


290
00:24:30.525 --> 00:24:33.457
- I'm just getting a head start.
- What makes you think he's dead?


291
00:24:33.659 --> 00:24:36.853
His bags were packed,
they found his car at the train station.


292
00:24:37.059 --> 00:24:38.752
You sound like
you know more than Jim.


293
00:24:38.959 --> 00:24:41.618
Well, you know, the paper
doesn't tell you everything.


294
00:24:41.825 --> 00:24:44.814
And I get that old Columbo feeling
every now and then, you know.


295
00:24:45.026 --> 00:24:47.685
Come on, Jim, help me out.
Throw me a bone. Off the record.


296
00:24:47.892 --> 00:24:50.051
All right, all right. 
Off the record.

297
00:24:50.258 --> 00:24:54.452

there day after he disappeared.

00:24:56.692 --> 00:25:01.057
If he'd left his wife,
why would he hire a plumber, huh?


299
00:25:01.258 --> 00:25:05.588
Wow, Detective Jim.
That's some crack police work there.


300
00:25:05.792 --> 00:25:07.917
What's your badge made out of,
chocolate?


301
00:25:08.125 --> 00:25:10.057
Solid brass, Lorenzo.

302
00:25:10.258 --> 00:25:12.349
You wanna come by sometime
and polish it?


303
00:25:12.559 --> 00:25:14.684
Oh, you mean the IA's letting you
keep it?


304
00:25:16.026 --> 00:25:18.651
Hey, hey, we're just talking
here, okay?


305
00:25:23.525 --> 00:25:24.923
Good to see you, Tom.

306
00:25:25.125 --> 00:25:27.353
Good to see you're doing well
after all that shit.


307
00:25:27.559 --> 00:25:29.081
- What are you drinking?
- I'm good.


308
00:25:29.292 --> 00:25:31.087
You good? All right.

309
00:25:32.026 --> 00:25:34.082
Next time.

310
00:25:39.425 --> 00:25:42.789
- What's wrong with you?
- He's a fucking asshole.


311
00:25:45.525 --> 00:25:47.684
Wanna hear something
that won't make the papers?


312
00:25:47.892 --> 00:25:50.619
- Yeah.
- This missing guy, Norcut?


313
00:25:50.825 --> 00:25:52.256
He knew Vaughn.

314
00:25:52.458 --> 00:25:55.219
The word is he cut a deal
with the DA to testify.


315
00:25:55.425 --> 00:25:57.357
- How'd you come by that?
- I didn't.


316
00:25:57.559 --> 00:26:00.787
I don't know shit. All I know is,
before the grand jury convenes..


317
00:26:00.992 --> 00:26:02.651
Norcut goes missing..

318
00:26:02.859 --> 00:26:05.416
this asshole's put on the case.

319
00:26:09.425 --> 00:26:12.482
But, Tommy, it was that domestic
on 36th..


320
00:26:12.692 --> 00:26:15.987
Hey, hey, hey, where you going?
Come on, get under here.


321
00:26:16.191 --> 00:26:19.316
- I'm not letting you drive. Come on.
- We are parked in a red zone.


322
00:26:19.525 --> 00:26:22.787
That's not the only thing
that's in the red zone. Come on.


323
00:26:22.991 --> 00:26:24.252
All right, all right.

324
00:26:29.825 --> 00:26:32.814
How old is my goddaughter now?
Thirteen, 14?


325
00:26:33.025 --> 00:26:37.117
Fourteen. Buckle up. It's the law.

326
00:26:38.725 --> 00:26:43.783
We're getting old, brother.
You had the right idea, though.


327
00:26:44.258 --> 00:26:46.247
Family first.

328
00:26:46.792 --> 00:26:51.656
Man doesn't have a family,
he doesn't have shit.


329
00:26:53.958 --> 00:26:55.686
I'm doing that outreach stuff now.

330
00:26:55.892 --> 00:26:59.449
You know, after-school programs?
It's the only thing keeps me sane.


331
00:26:59.659 --> 00:27:03.113
- What? What's so funny?
- After school, outreach?


332
00:27:03.325 --> 00:27:06.052
Who are you
and where did you put Eddie?


333
00:27:06.258 --> 00:27:10.714
I'm a very complex man, Tom.
And I'm fucking starving.


334
00:27:10.926 --> 00:27:13.585
- Let me buy you some waffles.
- All right.


335
00:27:14.258 --> 00:27:17.850
Hey, what happened at work today
that you wanted to talk about?


336
00:27:18.258 --> 00:27:19.918
Nothing. I can handle it.

337
00:27:33.292 --> 00:27:34.951
Hey. Anything pressing?

338
00:27:35.158 --> 00:27:37.647
- No, but..
- I'll be in the office.


339
00:27:41.125 --> 00:27:43.114
There's someone waiting for you.

340
00:27:49.358 --> 00:27:50.756
Mr. Cutler.

341
00:27:51.325 --> 00:27:54.086
I'm not sure if you remember me.
You came by my house.


342
00:27:54.692 --> 00:27:58.749
Oh, yeah, yeah. The birthday party.
Sorry about the mix-up, Mrs..


343
00:27:58.958 --> 00:27:59.981
Arms for Hope
Ann Norcut


344
00:28:00.191 --> 00:28:03.055
Norcut, Ann Norcut. Not Collins,
as you could see.


345
00:28:04.125 --> 00:28:05.682
Yes.

346
00:28:06.358 --> 00:28:09.654
- You wanna sit?
- I'd rather stand.


347
00:28:09.859 --> 00:28:10.949
How can I help you?

348
00:28:12.358 --> 00:28:15.791
I asked a question back at my house
and you never answered me.


349
00:28:16.125 --> 00:28:18.557
What kind of cleaning service
do you run here?


350
00:28:18.759 --> 00:28:22.452
Biomedical and biohazardous
abatement and sanitation.


351
00:28:22.925 --> 00:28:24.551
You clean crime scenes.

352
00:28:24.759 --> 00:28:26.917
Yeah, but that's only a part
of what we do.


353
00:28:27.125 --> 00:28:28.557
Cherie give you our brochure?

354
00:28:28.759 --> 00:28:31.418
I'm not sure if you've read
your paper yet, Mr. Cutler..


355
00:28:31.625 --> 00:28:33.284
but my husband is missing.

356
00:28:34.225 --> 00:28:37.918
That's your husband? I'm sorry.

357
00:28:38.458 --> 00:28:40.686
The day after my husband
disappears..


358
00:28:40.891 --> 00:28:43.790
a crime-scene cleaner shows up
at my door..


359
00:28:43.991 --> 00:28:47.287
talking about a job he did
at my house.


360
00:28:47.592 --> 00:28:49.853
What am I supposed to think
about that?


361
00:28:51.158 --> 00:28:54.716
I explained to you why I came by
your house. Sorry for the mix-up.


362
00:28:54.925 --> 00:28:58.722
If you have information that'll help
police find your husband, go to them.


363
00:28:58.925 --> 00:29:00.948
What makes you think I haven't
done that?


364
00:29:01.158 --> 00:29:04.488
Well, if you had, I'd be talking
to them and not you.


365
00:29:07.559 --> 00:29:11.150
I'm a retired police officer,
Mrs. Norcut.


366
00:29:12.659 --> 00:29:14.352
In my line of work..

367
00:29:15.158 --> 00:29:18.056
I'm in regular contact
with the police.


368
00:29:18.824 --> 00:29:21.450
If there were anything questionable
about a crime scene..


369
00:29:21.659 --> 00:29:23.851
I'd be the first one to step up.

370
00:29:26.824 --> 00:29:29.949
Look, I know what you're
going through is rough.


371
00:29:30.158 --> 00:29:31.590
I lost my wife a few years ago.

372
00:29:31.791 --> 00:29:33.724
- So I understand..
- Should I be grieving?


373
00:29:33.925 --> 00:29:36.221
No, no, no. Of course not.

374
00:29:36.425 --> 00:29:38.050
Then why would you empathize
with me?


375
00:29:38.258 --> 00:29:41.815
Well, I'm just saying that your concern
is understandable.


376
00:29:42.625 --> 00:29:45.954
You said you mistook my house
for one on Ridgecrest Lane?


377
00:29:46.158 --> 00:29:49.750
- What kind of work did you do there?
- I'm afraid I can't discuss that.


378
00:29:49.958 --> 00:29:55.016
I'm afraid I checked, Mr. Cutler.
There is no Ridgecrest Lane.


379
00:29:55.725 --> 00:29:59.952
So yes, I'd say that my concern
is more than understandable.


380
00:30:00.791 --> 00:30:02.848
Look, my husband made his share
of enemies..


381
00:30:03.058 --> 00:30:05.422
but I have a feeling you're
not one of them.


382
00:30:05.625 --> 00:30:08.284
Please. I won't repeat
anything you tell me.


383
00:30:08.492 --> 00:30:10.117
I just need to know for myself:

384
00:30:10.325 --> 00:30:13.984
Did you do any work at my house?

385
00:30:14.824 --> 00:30:18.188
Look, I would love to be
of more assistance to you.


386
00:30:18.592 --> 00:30:20.649
And I hope the police find
your husband.


387
00:30:20.858 --> 00:30:25.018
Now, if there's nothing else,
I have a really full day.


388
00:30:29.225 --> 00:30:31.555
I'm glad you're so friendly
with the police.


389
00:30:50.392 --> 00:30:52.688
Any time.

390
00:31:09.325 --> 00:31:13.417
- Mr. Cutler. The police are here.
- Thanks.


391
00:31:13.625 --> 00:31:15.715
Stay on the plastic.

392
00:31:15.958 --> 00:31:17.685
Did you hear me say
stay on the..?


393
00:31:19.392 --> 00:31:22.222
That's one way to skip out
on your bill.


394
00:31:22.559 --> 00:31:24.024
You got a second?

395
00:31:26.891 --> 00:31:28.789
Oh, what a dump.

396
00:31:28.991 --> 00:31:31.821
If I was gonna off myself, I think
I'd go to the Four Seasons.


397
00:31:32.025 --> 00:31:33.582
Yeah, a lot of people do.

398
00:31:33.791 --> 00:31:36.780
I'm sorry I got a little drunk
last night.


399
00:31:36.991 --> 00:31:39.855
- I know you wanted to talk.
- I'm kind of busy.


400
00:31:40.325 --> 00:31:42.553
Maybe you could find some time.

401
00:31:43.724 --> 00:31:46.088
Forensics searched the Norcut place
yesterday.


402
00:31:46.292 --> 00:31:47.280
Floor to ceiling.

403
00:31:48.125 --> 00:31:51.750
Not a drop of blood and no sign
of a struggle.


404
00:31:52.258 --> 00:31:53.883
Nothing.

405
00:31:57.958 --> 00:32:03.016
What they did find was chemicals,
cleansing agents.


406
00:32:03.458 --> 00:32:05.185
Lots of them.

407
00:32:05.758 --> 00:32:07.849
And I'm not talking Ajax.

408
00:32:08.958 --> 00:32:11.049
So I hear this..

409
00:32:11.425 --> 00:32:13.652
I remember you asking me
about the case last..


410
00:32:13.858 --> 00:32:16.416
- You following a lead here?
- It's not my case.


411
00:32:16.624 --> 00:32:20.022
It's not my department. And right now,
if you want, I'm not even a cop.


412
00:32:23.425 --> 00:32:26.255
The last time I asked for
your help, you almost lost your job.


413
00:32:26.458 --> 00:32:28.356
Yeah, it got a little choppy
back then.


414
00:32:28.559 --> 00:32:31.218
But I survived. So did you.

415
00:32:32.559 --> 00:32:38.116
- I don't regret what we did. Do you?
- Does it matter?


416
00:32:38.325 --> 00:32:42.348
- Still gotta live with it.
- Yeah, I've lived with it pretty good.


417
00:32:47.091 --> 00:32:49.284
What's on your mind, Thomas?

418
00:32:52.225 --> 00:32:53.850
And why didn't you call it in?

419
00:32:54.058 --> 00:32:56.115
I don't know who Vaughn's
got working there.


420
00:32:56.325 --> 00:32:59.416
I call it in to the wrong person,
I'm the one that goes missing.


421
00:32:59.624 --> 00:33:03.148
- You could've told me last night..
- I tried, I wanted to, but..


422
00:33:03.358 --> 00:33:06.222
I wasn't supposed to know about it,
so I decided not to know.


423
00:33:06.425 --> 00:33:08.050
Old habit.

424
00:33:08.258 --> 00:33:10.087
You still got all the papers, right?

425
00:33:10.292 --> 00:33:13.417
Yeah. Release forms, crime-scene
photos, everything's at the office.


426
00:33:13.624 --> 00:33:15.590
Hang on to everything,
it's your alibi.


427
00:33:15.791 --> 00:33:18.223
That just proves I was there,
not that I didn't do it.


428
00:33:18.425 --> 00:33:21.255
You were just doing a job.
No one can hang a case on you.


429
00:33:21.458 --> 00:33:23.889
But I had opportunity and ability.

430
00:33:24.091 --> 00:33:26.114
But not the motive, right?

431
00:33:26.325 --> 00:33:28.518
We never took a penny
from Vaughn.


432
00:33:30.191 --> 00:33:32.350
Right, Tom?

433
00:33:33.724 --> 00:33:35.281
Tom.

434
00:33:35.492 --> 00:33:39.185
You want me to help you out, you're
gonna have to tell me what's going on.


435
00:33:41.858 --> 00:33:44.086
You ever wonder why they
stopped questioning us..


436
00:33:44.292 --> 00:33:46.780
about Hill getting shanked
in prison?


437
00:33:48.558 --> 00:33:52.423
Vaughn comes to me, he says he can
make the whole inquiry go away..


438
00:33:52.624 --> 00:33:55.090
if I just do a job for him.

439
00:33:55.925 --> 00:33:58.948
I'm thinking about Rose,
and she's already lost a parent..


440
00:33:59.158 --> 00:34:02.521
so I do the job.

441
00:34:02.858 --> 00:34:04.881
Then I get tapped out
by the funeral.


442
00:34:05.091 --> 00:34:08.648
I need money to start the
new business, so I do another job.


443
00:34:08.858 --> 00:34:10.324
And another.

444
00:34:10.524 --> 00:34:13.252
I shake somebody down.
Look the other way.


445
00:34:13.458 --> 00:34:17.254
- Pull some evidence.
- That was years ago, Tommy.


446
00:34:17.458 --> 00:34:19.787
Jury's gonna see an old soldier
marching to orders.


447
00:34:19.991 --> 00:34:21.116
Ain't gonna be any jury.

448
00:34:21.325 --> 00:34:24.518
Everything Norcut knew, you think
Vaughn's gonna let anybody find him?


449
00:34:24.724 --> 00:34:26.883
- Vaughn's not running things.
- But his guys are.


450
00:34:27.091 --> 00:34:29.284
This case was closed
before it opened.


451
00:34:29.491 --> 00:34:31.219
The whole investigation is a show.

452
00:34:31.425 --> 00:34:33.890
You remember how things were.

453
00:34:34.591 --> 00:34:37.557
I panicked as she soon as
she told me her name was Norcut.


454
00:34:37.758 --> 00:34:41.156
I remember the name from back then.
Norcut was the money man.


455
00:34:42.125 --> 00:34:44.182
I looked her in the eye
and lied to her face.


456
00:34:44.392 --> 00:34:46.584
Just straight-up lied.

457
00:34:52.624 --> 00:34:54.352
What, Vaughn ever try
to get to you?


458
00:34:54.558 --> 00:34:55.956
Yeah, after you left.

459
00:34:56.158 --> 00:34:59.555
I told him where he could insert
his offer. I've been riding a desk since.


460
00:34:59.991 --> 00:35:03.048
- The price of honor, right?
- Right.


461
00:35:03.824 --> 00:35:07.052
Listen, sit tight and I'll find out
where Vargas is steering this..


462
00:35:07.258 --> 00:35:09.019
and I'll let you know.

463
00:35:09.824 --> 00:35:11.756
- Eddie.
- Yeah.


464
00:35:14.125 --> 00:35:15.352
Thanks.

465
00:35:15.558 --> 00:35:19.854
Fuck "thanks." Fuck "you're welcome."
This is you and me.


466
00:35:20.724 --> 00:35:22.622
I'll talk to you soon.

467
00:35:24.891 --> 00:35:26.118
<i>That's the old redhead.</i>

468
00:35:26.325 --> 00:35:30.723
<i>No bitterness. No recrimination.
Just a good swift left to the jaw.</i>


469
00:35:32.325 --> 00:35:35.757
<i>Oh, thank you, Edward. Come, Seth.
We have so much to talk about.</i>


470
00:35:36.225 --> 00:35:39.157
There's this thing.
Alexander Graham Bell invented it.


471
00:35:39.358 --> 00:35:42.017
Things ran a little late, I'm sorry.
Dinner smells good.


472
00:35:42.225 --> 00:35:45.214
It's not okay to leave a child
home alone. Anything could happen.


473
00:35:45.424 --> 00:35:48.413
- Wanna start staying at Anita's again?
- I want you to be home.


474
00:35:48.624 --> 00:35:50.988
I am home.
Hey, what's going on here?


475
00:35:51.191 --> 00:35:54.123
You're the one always saying
how you can take care of yourself.


476
00:35:54.325 --> 00:35:58.586
Rose, this school project..

477
00:36:00.624 --> 00:36:03.522
Hey. Hey, I'm talking to you.

478
00:36:04.424 --> 00:36:06.583
This project about your mom
got you thinking..


479
00:36:06.791 --> 00:36:09.951
At least someone's thinking
about her.


480
00:37:40.025 --> 00:37:40.924
Three, four, five.

481
00:37:53.125 --> 00:37:55.522
Seven, eight.

482
00:37:56.758 --> 00:37:59.883
Nine, ten.

483
00:38:03.858 --> 00:38:06.289
I told you he's out.

484
00:38:06.491 --> 00:38:08.889
- Then call him.
- Jim.


485
00:38:09.457 --> 00:38:11.923
Is there a problem?
- Tom, how you doing, buddy?


486
00:38:12.125 --> 00:38:14.182
This is my partner, 
Darrin Harris.

487
00:38:14.391 --> 00:38:17.516
- I've heard a lot about you.
- Well, you know, Jim likes to talk.


488
00:38:17.724 --> 00:38:18.712
How can I help you?

489
00:38:18.925 --> 00:38:21.618
They wanna search the place,
but they don't have a warrant.


490
00:38:21.824 --> 00:38:26.223
We don't wanna search the place.
Look, Tom, I'm in a bit of a bind, okay?


491
00:38:26.424 --> 00:38:28.720
Forensics found industrial cleanser
at a scene.


492
00:38:28.925 --> 00:38:30.720
They need samples
to match them against.


493
00:38:30.925 --> 00:38:32.447
I figured you're in the business.

494
00:38:32.658 --> 00:38:35.419
- Why didn't you give the OSHA list?
- He didn't ask for it.


495
00:38:35.624 --> 00:38:38.681
Instead, he came in here,
barking like a damn dog..


496
00:38:38.891 --> 00:38:41.721
without a warrant.
- Cherie, Cherie.


497
00:38:41.925 --> 00:38:45.288
- Could I please have the OSHA list?
- Of course.


498
00:38:46.691 --> 00:38:48.452
Do any work in Ewing County?

499
00:38:49.925 --> 00:38:53.119
No, not a lot. You know, rich people
tend to die in hospitals.


500
00:38:53.324 --> 00:38:56.155
Maybe you could check Ridgewood
Way about a week or so ago?


501
00:38:56.357 --> 00:38:57.823
Last name Norcut.

502
00:38:58.158 --> 00:38:59.885
Ridgewood Way?

503
00:39:02.758 --> 00:39:04.849
Norcut. Yeah, I read
about that case.


504
00:39:14.591 --> 00:39:15.852
No, no.

505
00:39:18.058 --> 00:39:19.956
Sorry. No Ridgewood Way.

506
00:39:20.491 --> 00:39:25.446
- Think we could snag a few samples?
- Yeah, sure. No problem.


507
00:39:25.925 --> 00:39:27.447
Come on.

508
00:39:39.724 --> 00:39:41.815
It's right here, guys.

509
00:39:46.891 --> 00:39:47.857
Nice ink.

510
00:39:48.424 --> 00:39:50.617
- Where you get those?
- Miguel?


511
00:39:50.824 --> 00:39:54.018
Would you go out to the van and get
me some of those red bags, please?


512
00:39:54.758 --> 00:39:56.883
No problem, Tom.

513
00:40:01.190 --> 00:40:05.555
- You ever heard of "excuse me"?
- Is that English or Spanish?


514
00:40:10.357 --> 00:40:11.448
When did he get out?

515
00:40:11.658 --> 00:40:14.818
Six months ago. I know his
probation officer. He's a good kid.


516
00:40:15.025 --> 00:40:17.082
What was he doing
last Thursday night?


517
00:40:17.291 --> 00:40:19.223
How the hell should I know?
Ask him.


518
00:40:21.025 --> 00:40:22.957
What about you?

519
00:40:24.357 --> 00:40:27.551
Home. I'm home every night.

520
00:40:27.758 --> 00:40:30.280
Credit card records say
you were downtown at the lvy..


521
00:40:30.491 --> 00:40:32.184
Thursday night.

522
00:40:37.190 --> 00:40:41.850
- Oh, yeah. High school reunion.
- High school reunion, huh?


523
00:40:43.058 --> 00:40:45.114
I skipped mine. Fuck them.

524
00:40:45.324 --> 00:40:47.381
- What time you leave?
- Eleven-thirty.


525
00:40:47.591 --> 00:40:51.387
- Why you checking my records?
- I'm just following up.


526
00:40:51.591 --> 00:40:56.421
- What about Friday afternoon?
- Downtown. Feline infestation.


527
00:40:56.624 --> 00:40:58.681
You wanna see Polaroids
of the litter boxes?


528
00:40:58.891 --> 00:41:00.652
Maybe some other time.

529
00:41:00.858 --> 00:41:02.915
Is that it? I gotta go back out.

530
00:41:03.124 --> 00:41:05.886
- No. No, you've been very cooperative.
- Make me happy..


531
00:41:06.091 --> 00:41:08.215
if you wrote that down too.

532
00:41:13.624 --> 00:41:15.214
Happy?

533
00:41:15.758 --> 00:41:17.815
As a pig in shit.

534
00:41:20.025 --> 00:41:22.820
Miguel, give these guys a hand,
would you?


535
00:41:49.691 --> 00:41:52.782
Oh, hey, I'm not done
with stocking this one yet.


536
00:41:52.991 --> 00:41:54.581
- You can do it later, okay?
- Okay.


537
00:41:54.791 --> 00:41:57.621
Listen, my wife wanted me
to invite you for dinner tomorrow.


538
00:41:57.824 --> 00:42:00.346
We wanna say thanks, you know.
And Mama can cook.


539
00:42:00.558 --> 00:42:04.217
- She's always watching food channels.
- You know, I'd really like to but I can't.


540
00:42:04.424 --> 00:42:07.322
- But I'll take a rain check, all right?
- All right.


541
00:42:07.524 --> 00:42:12.718
Look, Miguel, if those cops ask you
any questions, don't sweat it.


542
00:42:12.925 --> 00:42:16.982
- Just answer them straight, okay?
- Yeah, no problem.


543
00:42:17.190 --> 00:42:22.782
- And, brother, you okay?
- Yeah.


544
00:42:22.991 --> 00:42:24.217
Yeah, I'm good.

545
00:42:39.090 --> 00:42:40.317
- Come on.
- Go kids, go.


546
00:42:40.524 --> 00:42:41.956
Come on, come on.

547
00:42:44.491 --> 00:42:45.821
Go, Rosie.

548
00:42:46.024 --> 00:42:47.456
I have maybe a day and a half..

549
00:42:47.658 --> 00:42:50.681
before Vargas gets those test results
and puts me at the scene.


550
00:42:50.891 --> 00:42:54.186
He ordered enough tests
to keep the lab busy for a month.


551
00:42:54.891 --> 00:42:56.356
Hoping the thing dies down.

552
00:42:56.558 --> 00:42:58.956
- Vargas is going through the motions.
- If he's not?


553
00:42:59.157 --> 00:43:00.714
Once they find Vaughn's payroll..

554
00:43:00.925 --> 00:43:03.550
and those test results come in,
I'm suspect number one.


555
00:43:03.758 --> 00:43:06.622
When they need somebody to throw
to wolves, that somebody's me.


556
00:43:06.824 --> 00:43:09.312
Not throwing anybody to wolves.
Norcut stays missing..


557
00:43:09.524 --> 00:43:11.251
they can't prove there was a crime.

558
00:43:12.190 --> 00:43:14.349
Something fishy here. The wife.

559
00:43:14.558 --> 00:43:16.683
The wife. Why hasn't she told
Vargas about it?


560
00:43:20.758 --> 00:43:21.917
Maybe she believes you.

561
00:43:26.124 --> 00:43:29.284
Yeah! All right, Rosie!

562
00:43:34.990 --> 00:43:36.513
Tom, you missed it.

563
00:43:38.090 --> 00:43:40.147
- Way to go, Rose.
- You missed it, man.


564
00:43:40.357 --> 00:43:42.823
You should have seen it.
She was great.


565
00:43:48.658 --> 00:43:51.021
- How about pizza?
- No, we can't.


566
00:43:51.224 --> 00:43:53.315
Can't. She's got homework.
I got work to do.


567
00:43:53.524 --> 00:43:54.547
I did my homework.

568
00:43:56.524 --> 00:43:59.684
Another time, kiddo, okay?

569
00:43:59.891 --> 00:44:02.755
- Thanks for coming, Uncle Eddie.
- You're so welcome.


570
00:44:03.424 --> 00:44:04.720
You just broke a rib.

571
00:44:04.924 --> 00:44:07.550
- It was great to see you.
- It was great seeing you too.


572
00:44:08.990 --> 00:44:14.753
She's great, man. I'll dig some more.
Give you a call tomorrow.


573
00:44:14.957 --> 00:44:17.480
You think you could sit
on those hands till then?


574
00:44:17.691 --> 00:44:18.714
- Done.
- All right.


575
00:44:18.924 --> 00:44:21.152
- All right.
- Nice being with you. See you, Rosie.


576
00:44:21.357 --> 00:44:22.755
See you.

577
00:44:25.424 --> 00:44:26.412
Come in.

578
00:44:28.758 --> 00:44:30.155
- Hey.
- Hey.


579
00:44:30.357 --> 00:44:33.187
<i>To Kill a Mockingbird's on 46.
You wanna watch?</i>


580
00:44:33.391 --> 00:44:35.323
Thanks. I'll be out in a minute.

581
00:44:36.090 --> 00:44:37.181
Finish that report yet?

582
00:44:37.924 --> 00:44:39.049
Not yet.

583
00:44:46.990 --> 00:44:49.047
Where did you dig this up?
This was years ago.


584
00:44:50.491 --> 00:44:52.956
- Internet.
- Internet.


585
00:44:54.457 --> 00:44:58.412
Why did they question you
if he was killed in jail?


586
00:44:58.624 --> 00:45:00.089
Well, you know..

587
00:45:00.291 --> 00:45:03.155
sometimes people think the police
can do anything they want.


588
00:45:03.357 --> 00:45:04.789
That's not the case.

589
00:45:04.990 --> 00:45:07.752
They questioned us,
nothing came of it.


590
00:45:08.957 --> 00:45:11.014
What was his name?

591
00:45:11.224 --> 00:45:12.281
The man who did it.

592
00:45:12.491 --> 00:45:14.684
It only says "inmate."

593
00:45:19.724 --> 00:45:20.950
I just wanna know.

594
00:45:23.624 --> 00:45:26.419
I told you a hundred times.
Daniel Hill.


595
00:45:26.624 --> 00:45:28.783
He can't hurt us anymore.

596
00:45:53.357 --> 00:45:57.619
I've driven by this church
a thousand times and never came in.


597
00:45:57.823 --> 00:45:59.914
It's lovely.

598
00:46:00.124 --> 00:46:01.112
It's private.

599
00:46:02.391 --> 00:46:04.380
So were you followed?

600
00:46:05.591 --> 00:46:07.988
Who would be following me?

601
00:46:08.190 --> 00:46:12.623
- You wearing a wire?
- No. Are you?


602
00:46:19.524 --> 00:46:21.513
Why were you watching me
yesterday?


603
00:46:21.724 --> 00:46:24.155
Do you have something to tell me?

604
00:46:24.357 --> 00:46:26.050
Ask you.

605
00:46:27.157 --> 00:46:29.055
Why haven't you told
the police about me?


606
00:46:29.257 --> 00:46:31.519
I don't trust the police.

607
00:46:31.724 --> 00:46:34.417
Look, I know your husband
was talking to the DA.


608
00:46:34.624 --> 00:46:36.556
He was gonna testify
against Robert Vaughn.


609
00:46:36.758 --> 00:46:40.212
So I need to know
who else he was gonna implicate.


610
00:46:42.090 --> 00:46:44.113
Did you clean my house?

611
00:46:45.124 --> 00:46:48.056
Look, Mr. Cutler,
this has to be a two-way street.


612
00:46:48.257 --> 00:46:50.746
I haven't gone to the police
and I'm not about to.


613
00:46:50.957 --> 00:46:55.889
But, please, I need to know
what happened for myself.


614
00:46:59.057 --> 00:47:01.921
I used to come to this church
twice a week.


615
00:47:02.124 --> 00:47:05.886
Once for Mass, once for confession.

616
00:47:09.823 --> 00:47:12.688
That was a long time ago.

617
00:47:15.591 --> 00:47:16.988
Yes.

618
00:47:18.291 --> 00:47:19.847
Yeah, I cleaned your house.

619
00:47:22.924 --> 00:47:25.584
- Oh, God.
- Looked like a legitimate crime scene.


620
00:47:26.257 --> 00:47:28.280
Whoever did it had access
to the materials..


621
00:47:28.491 --> 00:47:30.514
and they knew procedure.

622
00:47:31.558 --> 00:47:33.785
- How did he..?
- He was shot.


623
00:47:36.090 --> 00:47:37.283
Where, exactly?

624
00:47:37.790 --> 00:47:41.018
Living room. On the couch.

625
00:47:42.090 --> 00:47:44.056
Who hired you?

626
00:47:44.691 --> 00:47:47.657
That's what I'm trying to find out,
Mrs. Norcut.


627
00:47:48.658 --> 00:47:51.488
- Two-way street, right?
- Yeah.


628
00:47:52.291 --> 00:47:55.382
What was your husband
going to tell the grand jury?


629
00:48:00.324 --> 00:48:03.778
I think it's better if I show you.

630
00:48:04.291 --> 00:48:09.053
This used to be an old fire station,
and now it's a safe haven for kids.


631
00:48:13.924 --> 00:48:16.152
That's a mighty big pair of scissors.

632
00:48:16.357 --> 00:48:17.845
Oh, that's Robert Vaughn.

633
00:48:18.057 --> 00:48:21.251
He did the initial fundraising.
Without him, we wouldn't be here.


634
00:48:22.624 --> 00:48:24.987
My office is upstairs.

635
00:48:33.990 --> 00:48:36.888
John wrote everything by hand
so that it could be authenticated.


636
00:48:37.090 --> 00:48:40.545
He called this his
"get out of jail free card."


637
00:48:40.757 --> 00:48:41.848
What is it?

638
00:48:42.057 --> 00:48:44.716
It's an account ledger,
but it's in some kind of code.


639
00:48:44.924 --> 00:48:46.685
Look. These numbers
look like dates.


640
00:48:46.890 --> 00:48:48.584
I'm assuming these
are dollar amounts.


641
00:48:48.790 --> 00:48:52.553
But this middle column,
I don't know.


642
00:48:52.757 --> 00:48:54.882
They're too short
to be account numbers, right?


643
00:48:55.090 --> 00:49:00.614
- Could they be phone numbers?
- No. Badge numbers.


644
00:49:00.823 --> 00:49:01.914
Are you sure?

645
00:49:02.124 --> 00:49:06.181
Yeah. This is a record
of every cop who's on the payroll.


646
00:49:06.990 --> 00:49:09.218
Jesus, this thing goes back
at least 10 years.


647
00:49:09.424 --> 00:49:11.390
Is there any way
we can find names?


648
00:49:12.057 --> 00:49:14.546
If I still had access, which I don't..

649
00:49:15.990 --> 00:49:17.853
it could take days..

650
00:49:18.057 --> 00:49:20.818
possibly weeks to match
these badge numbers with names.


651
00:49:21.024 --> 00:49:24.354
Plus we don't have any evidence.
Everybody in here's a suspect.


652
00:49:24.558 --> 00:49:26.183
All right. A couple of weeks ago..

653
00:49:26.391 --> 00:49:28.254
Vaughn came over
with another man.


654
00:49:28.457 --> 00:49:31.650
It ended up in a shouting match
and I haven't seen Vaughn since..


655
00:49:31.857 --> 00:49:35.255
but after that John became
really paranoid about the book.


656
00:49:35.457 --> 00:49:37.514
He kept talking
about going to the DA.


657
00:49:37.723 --> 00:49:41.621
- And who was the other man?
- A Detective Vargas.


658
00:49:44.124 --> 00:49:45.454
Okay.

659
00:49:45.657 --> 00:49:47.850
Look. I need you
to write down the names..


660
00:49:48.057 --> 00:49:50.682
of every cop you talked to
since, including Vargas.


661
00:49:50.890 --> 00:49:52.220
Okay.

662
00:49:52.424 --> 00:49:54.390
Maybe I can get
their badge numbers.


663
00:50:21.957 --> 00:50:23.684
Charming neighborhood.

664
00:50:23.890 --> 00:50:27.516
- I been looking for a summer home.
- You got that list for me?


665
00:50:30.590 --> 00:50:34.250
Marty Pappas, Darrin Harris,
Jim Vargas.


666
00:50:34.457 --> 00:50:36.218
What do you need
with all these badges?


667
00:50:36.424 --> 00:50:39.685
I met with the wife.
Seems Mr. Norcut kept records.


668
00:50:39.890 --> 00:50:42.617
Every cop that's ever taken a cent
is written in a ledger..


669
00:50:42.823 --> 00:50:44.187
and listed by badge number.

670
00:50:44.391 --> 00:50:47.152
Jesus, Tom. What are you..?

671
00:50:47.357 --> 00:50:50.346
You know how many guys Vaughn
would send if he knew you had that?


672
00:50:50.557 --> 00:50:53.522
- Let me worry about that.
- Well, take my advice.


673
00:50:53.523 --> 00:50:56.689
- Forget you ever saw any ledger.
- Not that simple.


674
00:50:56.890 --> 00:50:59.186
Yeah, it is. Somebody asks,
you say, "What ledger?"


675
00:50:59.391 --> 00:51:04.346
- I'm in the ledger.
- Jesus Christ. So burn it.


676
00:51:05.291 --> 00:51:07.416
It's your motive. 
Get rid of it.

677
00:51:07.623 --> 00:51:10.589
- It's practically got a bow on it.
- Poor woman's husband's dead.


678
00:51:10.790 --> 00:51:13.086
Burn the thing that might help her
find the killer?


679
00:51:13.291 --> 00:51:15.154
What do you care?
She's some rich bitch..


680
00:51:15.357 --> 00:51:19.584
wearing a million-dollar blindfold.
Get the book, light a match.


681
00:51:20.457 --> 00:51:23.513
- Thanks, partner.
- What the fuck you call me?


682
00:51:25.291 --> 00:51:28.688
Partners stick together, huh?
Partners follow the plan.


683
00:51:28.890 --> 00:51:30.913
I told you sit tight,
you dig up some book..


684
00:51:31.124 --> 00:51:33.056
half the fucking city
will kill you for?


685
00:51:33.257 --> 00:51:36.689
- Walk away, Tom. Forget it.
- Walk away? I tried to walk away.


686
00:51:36.890 --> 00:51:38.515
From everything. 
From all this shit.

687
00:51:38.723 --> 00:51:41.746
- And look where I am.
- All the shit. Shit like me, right?


688
00:51:41.957 --> 00:51:44.718
You pick up the phone
for the first time in how long..


689
00:51:44.924 --> 00:51:47.515
and is it because you wanna
catch up or bullshit..


690
00:51:47.723 --> 00:51:50.587
and, you know, let me see
my goddaughter?


691
00:51:50.790 --> 00:51:54.620
No, you need a goddamn favor.
And then again.


692
00:51:55.190 --> 00:51:59.145
You're family to me, Tom.
What am I to you?


693
00:52:00.590 --> 00:52:05.488
Some fucking last resort.
You don't want my advice, fine.


694
00:52:05.690 --> 00:52:09.123
Take it or leave it. But don't go calling
me partner like it means a thing.


695
00:52:09.324 --> 00:52:11.881
Scared I'm gonna find you
in the book there, Eddie?


696
00:52:12.623 --> 00:52:15.089
Four-nine-seven-three-three.

697
00:52:16.723 --> 00:52:21.156
- Here, you want a pen?
- No, I got it.


698
00:52:21.924 --> 00:52:26.254
You always had a good memory.
That's your fucking problem.


699
00:52:26.957 --> 00:52:28.752
You're gonna get yourself killed,
man.


700
00:53:28.356 --> 00:53:30.754
- You okay?
- Yeah.


701
00:53:32.990 --> 00:53:35.751
Oh, Tom, please don't. Just leave it.
It's not worth saving.


702
00:53:35.957 --> 00:53:37.946
No, I know how you feel.

703
00:53:38.990 --> 00:53:42.150
Tom? I can't stay here.

704
00:53:43.090 --> 00:53:45.283
Well, where you wanna go?
You got relatives?


705
00:53:45.957 --> 00:53:49.753
Yeah, but no family right now.

706
00:53:51.490 --> 00:53:53.888
Here, Tom, I got it, I got it.

707
00:53:54.924 --> 00:53:57.890
I'm sorry. I'll make us some more..

708
00:54:05.356 --> 00:54:10.051
I really need to go someplace.
I just don't feel safe being alone.


709
00:54:10.257 --> 00:54:12.916
Okay. I think I know a place.

710
00:54:29.957 --> 00:54:31.946
Hey, bro. Hey, come on in.
Come on in.


711
00:54:32.157 --> 00:54:33.713
- This is Ann.
- Ann, pleasure.


712
00:54:34.957 --> 00:54:36.445
- This is my wife, Gabriella.
- Hey.


713
00:54:36.657 --> 00:54:38.384
- Hi. Nice to meet you.
- This is Ann.


714
00:54:38.590 --> 00:54:40.056
- Hi. Very nice to meet you.
- Hi.


715
00:54:40.257 --> 00:54:42.415
And this is Baby Julio.

716
00:54:42.623 --> 00:54:44.180
- Hey, little man.
- This one's Lila.


717
00:54:44.390 --> 00:54:45.879
- Say hello, Lila.
- Hello.


718
00:54:46.090 --> 00:54:47.385
Hello.

719
00:54:47.590 --> 00:54:50.852
- Hello.
- Put me down, Daddy.


720
00:54:51.057 --> 00:54:52.545
Don't let that halo fool you.

721
00:54:52.757 --> 00:54:54.950
Come see my horsies.

722
00:54:55.157 --> 00:54:56.554
<i>- Not now, mi amor.
- That's okay.</i>


723
00:54:57.057 --> 00:54:58.989
Want me to see your horsies?
Wanna take me?


724
00:54:59.190 --> 00:55:00.178
- Yeah.
- Okay.


725
00:55:00.390 --> 00:55:02.447
- I'm gonna go check on dinner.
- Okay, sweetie.


726
00:55:02.657 --> 00:55:06.055
She didn't feel safe, and I couldn't
take her to my place..


727
00:55:06.490 --> 00:55:08.150
because Rose wouldn't understand.

728
00:55:08.356 --> 00:55:09.344
- Thanks.
- Yeah.


729
00:55:09.557 --> 00:55:13.580
It's like you said. Client's in trouble,
we gotta help them out.


730
00:55:29.990 --> 00:55:32.649
Hey. Come on.

731
00:55:36.456 --> 00:55:39.547
- That smells so good.
- Thank you.


732
00:55:39.757 --> 00:55:42.848
Be careful. This is very hot.

733
00:55:44.657 --> 00:55:47.180
- Lila, honey. In your chair, please.
- No, no. It's fine.


734
00:55:47.390 --> 00:55:50.413
I used to eat
like this all the time.

735
00:55:58.090 --> 00:56:01.453
Hey, Tom, could you
give us the honors and say grace?


736
00:56:01.657 --> 00:56:02.884
- Me?
- Yeah.


737
00:56:06.490 --> 00:56:08.081
Heavenly Father..

738
00:56:08.290 --> 00:56:10.222
thank you for good friends,
good food..


739
00:56:10.423 --> 00:56:12.252
and bless the hands
that prepared it.


740
00:56:12.456 --> 00:56:13.513
- Amen.
- Amen.


741
00:56:13.723 --> 00:56:15.518
- Amen.
- Please.


742
00:56:15.723 --> 00:56:17.155
Please, dig in.

743
00:56:18.690 --> 00:56:20.918
I know this is less
than what you're used to but..


744
00:56:21.124 --> 00:56:23.056
It's perfect.

745
00:56:23.256 --> 00:56:27.313
Hey, believe it or not, I used to live
about three blocks away from here.


746
00:56:27.523 --> 00:56:29.751
A studio apartment
above this Korean place.


747
00:56:29.957 --> 00:56:31.422
You remember Sun's Kitchen?

748
00:56:31.623 --> 00:56:33.089
- Yeah, I know Sun's.
- Yeah.


749
00:56:33.290 --> 00:56:34.586
- It's not there anymore.
- No.


750
00:56:34.790 --> 00:56:37.381
That whole building
isn't there anymore.


751
00:56:39.456 --> 00:56:41.513
You know, if you were to ask me
back then..


752
00:56:41.723 --> 00:56:43.985
how my life was gonna turn out..

753
00:56:44.189 --> 00:56:46.246
I would have said like this.

754
00:56:46.990 --> 00:56:52.445
Warm house, kids running around,
magnets on the refrigerator.


755
00:56:55.857 --> 00:56:58.119
John didn't want kids.

756
00:57:01.024 --> 00:57:06.082
But we almost had one recently.

757
00:57:06.790 --> 00:57:08.619
We lost it.

758
00:57:09.456 --> 00:57:10.945
Sorry.

759
00:57:12.790 --> 00:57:14.551
So am I.

760
00:57:30.256 --> 00:57:32.688
What's the worst thing you've seen?

761
00:57:35.057 --> 00:57:37.113
Oh, I wanna know.

762
00:57:42.490 --> 00:57:45.251
The worst thing I've ever seen.

763
00:57:47.189 --> 00:57:52.121
That would have to be before this job
when I was a cop.


764
00:57:54.189 --> 00:57:55.746
A homicide.

765
00:57:55.957 --> 00:58:00.446
Victim was a woman in her 30s,
two gunshot wounds to the chest.


766
00:58:00.657 --> 00:58:02.589
Shooter was there to rob the place..

767
00:58:02.790 --> 00:58:05.585
victim put up a fight
and he shot her.


768
00:58:06.089 --> 00:58:08.248
There was moderate blood pooling
on the floor..


769
00:58:08.456 --> 00:58:12.014
some spatter on the beds
and walls.


770
00:58:13.957 --> 00:58:15.855
That's the worst thing?

771
00:58:17.590 --> 00:58:21.078
Down the hall in another bedroom,
there was a kid.


772
00:58:21.290 --> 00:58:22.984
Two paramedics were sitting
with her.


773
00:58:23.189 --> 00:58:27.781
She was clutching a stuffed animal,
a frog.


774
00:58:27.990 --> 00:58:31.752
She found her mother's body
and called 911.


775
00:58:33.256 --> 00:58:35.814
Tough kid, if you think about it.

776
00:58:36.690 --> 00:58:41.554
Six years old and she still had sense
enough to call 911.


777
00:58:43.390 --> 00:58:44.378
But those eyes.

778
00:58:46.490 --> 00:58:48.547
Those eyes that..

779
00:58:49.490 --> 00:58:53.650
saw something
no kid should ever have to see.


780
00:58:56.023 --> 00:59:00.217
Those eyes looked at me.
Looked into me.


781
00:59:00.757 --> 00:59:02.382
Through me.

782
00:59:04.323 --> 00:59:06.186
Those eyes.

783
00:59:10.223 --> 00:59:14.883
- That's the worst thing I've ever seen.
- She was your daughter.


784
00:59:18.957 --> 00:59:20.684
Did you catch him?

785
00:59:21.790 --> 00:59:23.551
Oh, yeah.

786
00:59:24.957 --> 00:59:26.718
Yeah, we got him.

787
00:59:57.657 --> 00:59:59.885
License and registration, please.

788
01:00:04.989 --> 01:00:08.251
- Is there a problem, officer?
- Your taillight's out.


789
01:00:10.590 --> 01:00:13.249
- So where you headed?
- Was I speeding too?


790
01:00:13.456 --> 01:00:15.445
- I asked where you're headed.
- Home.


791
01:00:15.924 --> 01:00:18.048
I live a couple of blocks from here.

792
01:00:18.757 --> 01:00:21.746
Look, I'm a retired police officer.

793
01:00:21.956 --> 01:00:23.650
Is there a problem?

794
01:00:23.857 --> 01:00:25.413
I know who you are, Tom.

795
01:00:42.956 --> 01:00:44.286
Hi.

796
01:00:45.390 --> 01:00:48.879
- What happened to your face?
- Nothing, I'm okay.


797
01:00:52.923 --> 01:00:54.514
- Don't be a baby.
- It burns.


798
01:01:03.356 --> 01:01:05.083
You're not gonna tell me
what happened?


799
01:01:05.290 --> 01:01:07.222
It's nothing.
Your dad's a tough old bird.


800
01:01:07.423 --> 01:01:08.911
I can take it.

801
01:01:10.790 --> 01:01:12.982
- That's it?
- Yeah.


802
01:01:15.089 --> 01:01:16.555
Oh, you're pretty good at this.

803
01:01:16.757 --> 01:01:19.655
- Should I be saving for med school?
- I don't care what you do.


804
01:01:19.857 --> 01:01:22.846
What was that? What did you say?
Hey, hey.


805
01:01:23.290 --> 01:01:25.483
That attitude of yours has gotta stop.
Now.


806
01:01:25.690 --> 01:01:27.280
Why won't you tell me
what happened?


807
01:01:27.490 --> 01:01:29.285
It doesn't involve you.
I'm handling it.


808
01:01:29.723 --> 01:01:31.313
I thought we were a team, Dad.

809
01:01:31.523 --> 01:01:34.683
What if you come home stabbed?
Shot? What if you don't come home?


810
01:01:34.889 --> 01:01:35.877
It's not gonna happen.

811
01:01:36.089 --> 01:01:38.351
- Happened to her.
- Think that's gonna happen to me?


812
01:01:38.557 --> 01:01:41.182
Yes! I'm fucking terrified of it!

813
01:01:44.490 --> 01:01:48.217
Rose, that's not going to happen.
Look at me.


814
01:01:49.490 --> 01:01:53.547
I'm never going to let anything
like that happen again.


815
01:01:53.757 --> 01:01:55.620
And we are a team.
We're a good team.


816
01:01:55.823 --> 01:01:57.254
We look out for each other.

817
01:01:57.456 --> 01:02:00.445
But we don't dwell on things
we have no control over.


818
01:02:00.657 --> 01:02:02.054
This project.

819
01:02:02.256 --> 01:02:05.586
- I mean, look what it's doing to you.
- There is no stupid report, Dad.


820
01:02:05.790 --> 01:02:10.051
- There's no..? I don't understand.
- I'm starting to forget her!


821
01:02:10.256 --> 01:02:11.244
Oh, Rose.

822
01:02:11.456 --> 01:02:14.684
Look, you can't spend your life
going through this box looking for her.


823
01:02:14.889 --> 01:02:19.083
She's not there. She's gone.
It's just you and me now, okay?


824
01:02:19.290 --> 01:02:23.518
So let's just put this away, all right?
Just put it away.


825
01:02:25.223 --> 01:02:28.553
- Rose, pick this stuff up. Rose.
- You don't understand!


826
01:02:28.757 --> 01:02:31.518
- You don't understand.
- Pick that up. What is wrong with you?


827
01:02:31.723 --> 01:02:34.245
- Have you lost your mind?
- You don't get it.


828
01:02:35.290 --> 01:02:36.688
You don't get it.

829
01:04:52.756 --> 01:04:54.120
<i>- Hello?
- I'm coming to get you.</i>


830
01:04:54.323 --> 01:04:57.050
Wait, wait, wait. I'm not at the house.
I'm at the hospital.


831
01:04:57.256 --> 01:05:00.416
Vargas called this morning. He
said he wanted me to identify a body.


832
01:05:00.623 --> 01:05:04.248
The press found out John was gonna
testify. It's on the news, everywhere.


833
01:05:04.456 --> 01:05:06.547
- What hospital?
- West Trenton General.


834
01:05:06.756 --> 01:05:10.245
<i>All right. Just stay there.
I know a back way in.</i>


835
01:05:25.856 --> 01:05:28.379
- You all right?
- Yeah, thank you.


836
01:05:28.590 --> 01:05:31.885
- What happened to your face?
- Nothing.


837
01:05:42.557 --> 01:05:44.546
- Sure it's not John's?
- No.


838
01:05:44.756 --> 01:05:46.847
His key was still on the ring
found in his car.


839
01:05:47.056 --> 01:05:49.988
Anybody else have one?
Sister, neighbor?


840
01:05:50.189 --> 01:05:54.780
No one. John was paranoid.
He didn't want copies lying around.


841
01:05:54.989 --> 01:05:57.921
Maybe he had one made
for someone he didn't tell you about.


842
01:05:58.123 --> 01:06:01.714
As in a woman?
That wasn't John's style.


843
01:06:01.923 --> 01:06:03.912
Not making keys for them anyway.

844
01:06:04.123 --> 01:06:07.748
Look, I don't see
how any of this is helping us.


845
01:06:07.956 --> 01:06:10.286
Vaughn didn't need this
to look like an abduction.


846
01:06:10.490 --> 01:06:14.922
If he'd known about the ledger, he'd
have ransacked your house to find it.


847
01:06:15.123 --> 01:06:19.646
Someone with a key wanted you
to come home to a clean house.


848
01:06:24.557 --> 01:06:26.613
Arlo.

849
01:06:27.956 --> 01:06:30.683
Oh, Tom. You scared me.

850
01:06:31.889 --> 01:06:35.844
- This is Ann Norcut.
- Norcut. Right.


851
01:06:36.290 --> 01:06:38.518
Wait.
Does Vargas know you're here?


852
01:06:38.722 --> 01:06:40.950
I was hoping we can
get through this without him.


853
01:06:41.156 --> 01:06:43.247
He kind of needs to be here,
but I don't know.


854
01:06:43.456 --> 01:06:45.853
Maybe we could do
the paperwork without him.


855
01:06:46.056 --> 01:06:49.284
I don't understand why I have to do
this. They have photos of John.


856
01:06:49.490 --> 01:06:53.683
They didn't tell you. Well, the corpse
does not have much of a face.


857
01:06:58.656 --> 01:07:00.645
Mrs. Norcut, I guess
all we need from you..


858
01:07:00.856 --> 01:07:03.788
is to identify a couple
of DMs and the wedding band.


859
01:07:03.989 --> 01:07:07.080
- DMs?
- Distinguishing marks.


860
01:07:07.290 --> 01:07:09.551
If I could get you
to sign these, the top portion.


861
01:07:09.756 --> 01:07:11.779
Excuse me. Is there a restroom?
I feel faint.


862
01:07:11.989 --> 01:07:15.921
Yes. I'm sorry.
Just the way you came in, right..


863
01:07:18.423 --> 01:07:21.786
Boy, you don't get to practice
your bedside manner around here.


864
01:07:21.989 --> 01:07:26.115
- Well, how bad is the body?
- Rat food, but it's him.


865
01:07:26.323 --> 01:07:28.788
I checked the scars
against the records.


866
01:07:28.989 --> 01:07:32.512
Got an appendectomy work over here.
Got the one from Bob Barker.


867
01:07:32.722 --> 01:07:35.314
I got Larry coming over
to check his teeth, to make sure.


868
01:07:35.522 --> 01:07:37.545
- You know Larry?
- Bob Barker?


869
01:07:37.756 --> 01:07:40.052
Yeah. You know,
spay and neuter your pets?


870
01:07:41.423 --> 01:07:44.877
- Guy got snipped.
- When did he have a vasectomy?


871
01:07:45.423 --> 01:07:49.355
A few years ago. Something like that.
It's right here in the records.


872
01:07:51.290 --> 01:07:55.949
- Hey, I was just about to call you.
- What the hell you doing here?


873
01:07:56.156 --> 01:07:59.179
Lunch with a colleague.
Thai still good?


874
01:07:59.390 --> 01:08:04.515
Yeah, but I gotta finish this thing up.
I got a good spot too.


875
01:08:06.423 --> 01:08:09.446
- Detective.
- Miss Norcut.


876
01:08:09.656 --> 01:08:13.316
- You know this man?
- No, I've never met him.


877
01:08:13.522 --> 01:08:19.387
Excuse me. Can we get this over with?
I don't feel very well. Thank you.


878
01:08:23.956 --> 01:08:27.786
I don't like this, Tom. I'm seeing you
all the time these days.


879
01:08:27.989 --> 01:08:31.614
- That's not good.
- Well, that hurts me, Jim.


880
01:08:32.189 --> 01:08:34.155
Well, here's the deal.

881
01:08:36.455 --> 01:08:37.853
We've never been tight..

882
01:08:38.056 --> 01:08:40.749
but I never been against you,
even after that thing.


883
01:08:40.956 --> 01:08:43.615
- And what thing would that be?
- I mean, so what?


884
01:08:43.822 --> 01:08:46.720
Piece of shit catches a knife
in the arm. Big fucking deal.


885
01:08:47.256 --> 01:08:52.188
Some wanted to bring you down.
Make an example of you. Not me.


886
01:08:53.223 --> 01:08:55.552
He violated your family.
You had every right.


887
01:08:55.756 --> 01:08:57.188
This have a fucking point?

888
01:08:57.390 --> 01:09:00.583
Point is you don't want me
against you.


889
01:09:00.789 --> 01:09:03.949
That guy in there didn't die in prison.
He's connected.


890
01:09:04.156 --> 01:09:07.281
I gotta bring all the guns.
So why don't you tell me?


891
01:09:07.489 --> 01:09:11.683
- What are you doing here?
- Lunch. You wanna join us?


892
01:09:11.889 --> 01:09:15.514
- Okay. We don't have to have Thai.
- Are you fucking her?


893
01:09:17.223 --> 01:09:19.189
Nothing to be ashamed of. I would.

894
01:09:19.589 --> 01:09:22.919
I'm not gonna hit you. You have
to find another reason to arrest me.


895
01:09:23.123 --> 01:09:25.987
Oh, I don't need a reason.
I could just take you in.


896
01:09:26.189 --> 01:09:29.780
Sweat you out a few hours.
A few days maybe.


897
01:09:29.989 --> 01:09:34.819
Okay. So let's settle this between us.
How's 10 grand sound?


898
01:09:35.023 --> 01:09:37.580
I can get Vaughn
to write you another check.


899
01:09:37.789 --> 01:09:39.778
Detective?

900
01:09:42.256 --> 01:09:47.211
Nice knowing you, Tom.
Don't fucking move.


901
01:09:52.089 --> 01:09:53.987
Mrs. Norcut
has identified the deceased..


902
01:09:54.189 --> 01:09:56.677
as her husband, John H. Norcut.

903
01:10:06.622 --> 01:10:10.850
- Jesus, what happened to you?
- Ran into a blue wall.


904
01:10:11.056 --> 01:10:14.216
I called the precinct.
They told me you were here.


905
01:10:14.756 --> 01:10:16.745
I'm surprised
you remember where here is.


906
01:10:16.956 --> 01:10:20.286
Vargas is in the ledger. I don't
think he had anything to do with this.


907
01:10:20.489 --> 01:10:23.717
- You want a soda, a beer?
- They didn't kill Norcut for the book.


908
01:10:23.923 --> 01:10:27.253
She's got some guy on the side. It's
his key I used to get in the house.


909
01:10:27.455 --> 01:10:29.421
You still on the same place
on Eighth?


910
01:10:29.622 --> 01:10:33.180
- I haven't been down there in forever.
- Cut the shit, Eddie.


911
01:10:33.389 --> 01:10:35.878
Oh, I'm sorry.
This isn't a friendly visit?


912
01:10:36.089 --> 01:10:37.679
- Did you hear what I said?
- Yeah.


913
01:10:37.889 --> 01:10:41.321
Her boyfriend killed her husband.
What else is new?


914
01:10:41.522 --> 01:10:44.250
- What do you want, an apology?
- Oh, fuck your apology.


915
01:10:44.455 --> 01:10:47.683
- You don't owe me anything.
- I changed jobs, okay?


916
01:10:47.889 --> 01:10:49.855
I changed houses, cars, clothes.

917
01:10:50.056 --> 01:10:53.613
Only thing I kept was Rose.
I'm doing a hell of a job with her.


918
01:10:53.822 --> 01:10:57.277
I didn't wanna cut you off,
man. I had to.


919
01:10:58.822 --> 01:11:02.310
Okay, I fucked up, all right?
Is that what you wanna hear?


920
01:11:02.522 --> 01:11:05.386
I just want my partner back, Tommy.

921
01:11:06.056 --> 01:11:09.852
Not for a day.
You know, not for one last thing.


922
01:11:10.056 --> 01:11:12.385
Back, man.

923
01:11:14.923 --> 01:11:20.049
- I'm back.
- Yeah? All right.


924
01:11:22.589 --> 01:11:26.681
All right, so let's shut up about that.
Where is she now?


925
01:11:26.889 --> 01:11:29.354
Talking to Vargas.
God knows what she's telling him.


926
01:11:29.556 --> 01:11:33.352
Can you get your hands on the book?
Then call Vargas, arrange a trade..


927
01:11:33.556 --> 01:11:35.454
give him the book,
he'll drop the case.


928
01:11:35.656 --> 01:11:39.748
No. We gotta go over his head. Cut
him off before he can make a case.


929
01:11:39.956 --> 01:11:42.319
- Cut him off with what?
- The truth.


930
01:11:42.522 --> 01:11:45.545
They're gonna wanna know how you
know, why you didn't come forward.


931
01:11:45.756 --> 01:11:48.916
- They're gonna be all over your ass.
- Well, she can back us up.


932
01:11:49.123 --> 01:11:51.953
What if she doesn't?
She's probably loyal to this guy.


933
01:11:52.156 --> 01:11:54.678
- That's a chance I'll have to take.
- Listen, Tom.


934
01:11:54.889 --> 01:11:57.377
The best shot we have
is with Vargas directly.


935
01:11:57.589 --> 01:12:00.078
I'll go with you. Make sure
he doesn't pull any shit.


936
01:12:00.289 --> 01:12:03.949
We could take care of this. The three
of us. We could do it tonight.


937
01:12:04.756 --> 01:12:06.722
I'll make the call.

938
01:12:07.322 --> 01:12:10.118
I gotta pick Rose up first.
Give me an hour.


939
01:12:10.322 --> 01:12:12.311
We can make the trade
at the old depot.


940
01:12:12.522 --> 01:12:15.386
He's back, ladies and gentlemen.
The old depot, in an hour.


941
01:12:15.589 --> 01:12:19.749
Hey.
What, I don't even get a goodbye?


942
01:12:21.123 --> 01:12:23.180
Bye, Eddie.

943
01:13:05.989 --> 01:13:10.683
- Ann. You all right?
- How did you get in?


944
01:13:12.856 --> 01:13:18.345
Of course. I'm actually fine.
It just keeps opening up.


945
01:13:18.556 --> 01:13:21.351
- So where you going?
- Nowhere.


946
01:13:21.556 --> 01:13:23.613
Why's your car packed?

947
01:13:26.422 --> 01:13:31.787
I know who this key belongs to,
and so do you.


948
01:13:36.255 --> 01:13:39.881
You really shouldn't be here. Vargas
is asking a lot of questions about you.


949
01:13:40.089 --> 01:13:42.281
Eddie Lorenzo was my partner.

950
01:13:42.489 --> 01:13:46.013
He was my friend. My best man.
He's my daughter's godfather.


951
01:13:46.222 --> 01:13:48.814
- Don't know what you're talking about.
- Stop lying to me.


952
01:13:49.023 --> 01:13:51.420
We need to go
to the police and tell them everything.


953
01:13:51.622 --> 01:13:56.078
Tell them what, Tom? It's a key.
So what? It could belong to anybody.


954
01:13:56.289 --> 01:13:59.221
And what about that baby?
Could that be anybody's too?


955
01:13:59.956 --> 01:14:01.945
Get out.

956
01:14:02.989 --> 01:14:05.147
Did you ask him to do it?
Is that what happened?


957
01:14:05.355 --> 01:14:09.083
He didn't do it. He'd never do that.
He told me that and I believe him.


958
01:14:09.289 --> 01:14:11.585
- Now get out, Tom.
- He's lying.


959
01:14:11.956 --> 01:14:16.082
Oh, go ahead. Call the police.
I'll just tell them you broke in.


960
01:14:16.522 --> 01:14:19.147
- I'm calling Eddie.
- Wait.


961
01:14:19.355 --> 01:14:22.219
If he still has his key, he's innocent.
And I'll go.


962
01:14:22.756 --> 01:14:24.381
- Just ask him.
- Please don't do this.


963
01:14:24.589 --> 01:14:25.577
Ask him.

964
01:14:25.956 --> 01:14:30.684
<i>- Please.
- Annie? Annie?</i>


965
01:14:31.622 --> 01:14:36.645
<i>- Annie, are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.</i>


966
01:14:36.856 --> 01:14:43.311
Hey, I was gonna ask you. Can you
give the key back, just in case?


967
01:14:45.622 --> 01:14:50.919
- Okay, good. Okay, no, that's all.
- Well?


968
01:14:53.122 --> 01:14:55.452
He already threw it away.

969
01:15:05.889 --> 01:15:10.378
You should've seen him, Tom.
He was so happy when I told him.


970
01:15:10.589 --> 01:15:15.715
He said it was a girl and he ran out
and bought all these presents.


971
01:15:16.255 --> 01:15:18.813
But I couldn't tell John.

972
01:15:19.455 --> 01:15:23.945
So I told Ed that I had a miscarriage,
but he didn't believe me.


973
01:15:24.155 --> 01:15:26.781
He thought John forced me.

974
01:15:27.122 --> 01:15:30.145
- We have to tell the police.
- No.


975
01:15:30.355 --> 01:15:34.754
Tom, just give me the key.
Nobody needs to know about this.


976
01:15:35.255 --> 01:15:38.017
If you go to the police,
I'll deny it and so will he.


977
01:15:38.589 --> 01:15:40.680
That's a chance I have to take.

978
01:15:40.889 --> 01:15:44.514
Tom, please don't be so naive.
We all have secrets.


979
01:15:47.088 --> 01:15:49.646
I'm tired of keeping secrets.

980
01:15:58.589 --> 01:16:02.419
I have to see someone. It may take a
while, so I need you to stay at Anita's.


981
01:16:02.889 --> 01:16:05.548
- I don't need a babysitter.
- I called. She's expecting you.


982
01:16:05.756 --> 01:16:09.244
- Dad.
- Look. No arguments, please?


983
01:16:10.956 --> 01:16:14.012
Hey, hey, hey. No hug?

984
01:16:19.556 --> 01:16:21.545
Love you.

985
01:16:35.155 --> 01:16:37.348
Yes, Detective Vargas, please.

986
01:17:12.656 --> 01:17:15.417
- Where's Lorenzo?
- He'll be here.


987
01:17:17.922 --> 01:17:19.548
Look, relax, Tom.

988
01:17:20.856 --> 01:17:25.220
We got three units covering the road
in. Two more down on the tracks.


989
01:17:25.422 --> 01:17:26.854
No way he's getting out of here.

990
01:17:34.289 --> 01:17:38.346
I know it doesn't feel like it right now,
but you're doing the right thing.


991
01:17:38.922 --> 01:17:41.081
He may be your buddy,
but he's made some mistakes.


992
01:17:41.689 --> 01:17:45.212
- Best to let the law handle it from here.
- Save that shit for the TV cameras.


993
01:17:45.422 --> 01:17:49.354
We both know why you're here.
You're saving Robert Vaughn's ass.


994
01:17:51.289 --> 01:17:53.255
Fair enough.

995
01:17:54.222 --> 01:17:57.120
You got that ledger?
We'll get Lorenzo.


996
01:17:57.322 --> 01:17:59.481
This goes away.
You go on with your life.


997
01:17:59.689 --> 01:18:03.849
- You'll get it when he's in custody.
- Fair enough, okay.


998
01:18:09.088 --> 01:18:11.350
Rose, I thought I told you
to go to Anita's.


999
01:18:11.556 --> 01:18:14.283
Oh, it's okay. I'm not alone.
Uncle Eddie's here.


1000
01:18:17.756 --> 01:18:20.051
- Put him on.
- Okay. Uncle Eddie?


1001
01:18:21.489 --> 01:18:26.421
Hey, Tom. Running a little late.
We need to talk.


1002
01:18:26.622 --> 01:18:31.179
Come alone.
Yeah, great. See you soon.


1003
01:18:39.088 --> 01:18:41.577
Tom, where you going?

1004
01:18:56.255 --> 01:18:59.278
- Hey, here he is.
- Hey, Dad.


1005
01:18:59.988 --> 01:19:03.920
- Rosie insisted on making dinner.
- Rose, I want you to go next door.


1006
01:19:05.088 --> 01:19:06.714
Now.

1007
01:19:07.255 --> 01:19:09.221
I got one ready for you.

1008
01:19:10.255 --> 01:19:12.380
- Dad.
- That's okay, Rosie. Take it easy.


1009
01:19:13.055 --> 01:19:15.578
Everything's all right. He just had
a hard week at work.


1010
01:19:15.789 --> 01:19:18.879
We're gonna sit, have dinner,
talk things over so everybody knows..


1011
01:19:19.088 --> 01:19:22.213
what's going on here.
- Next door, Rose. Now.


1012
01:19:25.589 --> 01:19:28.077
All you had to do was show up,
do your job and go home.


1013
01:19:28.289 --> 01:19:30.152
- I had it all figured out.
- You set me up.


1014
01:19:30.355 --> 01:19:33.014
I had you protected.
I was protecting both of you.


1015
01:19:33.222 --> 01:19:36.188
- I couldn't let her come and see that.
- You call this protection?


1016
01:19:36.389 --> 01:19:39.014
I needed you to back off.
You know, I'm sorry.


1017
01:19:39.222 --> 01:19:41.745
- I should have known better.
- Come on, let's go.


1018
01:19:41.955 --> 01:19:45.353
What are you doing to me? Wait.
Listen, we could still do this.


1019
01:19:45.955 --> 01:19:49.285
Get Vargas on the phone. We can
hammer out some kind of angle.


1020
01:19:49.489 --> 01:19:53.784
- I don't work like that anymore.
- You take some oath as a janitor?


1021
01:19:54.556 --> 01:19:56.545
Stop it.

1022
01:19:57.055 --> 01:20:00.044
Okay. I see how it is now.
Anything goes when it's good for you.


1023
01:20:00.255 --> 01:20:03.744
But when I need help?
Where was that conscience of yours..


1024
01:20:03.955 --> 01:20:07.785
when Daniel Hill was bleeding
to death in the prison yard, huh?


1025
01:20:08.355 --> 01:20:10.685
That keep you up too?

1026
01:20:12.055 --> 01:20:14.953
No, you were fucking
sleeping like a baby.


1027
01:20:24.589 --> 01:20:26.612
Check your loyalties, buddy.

1028
01:20:26.821 --> 01:20:29.310
- You owe me.
- Put the gun away, Eddie.


1029
01:20:29.522 --> 01:20:33.147
Norcut was a fucking murderer.
Period.


1030
01:20:33.355 --> 01:20:37.515
- Who'd he kill, Eddie? Nobody.
- No, not nobody. He made her do it.


1031
01:20:39.721 --> 01:20:42.051
- He made her kill her own baby.
- She lied to you.


1032
01:20:42.255 --> 01:20:45.312
You think I can't have
what you have?


1033
01:20:45.522 --> 01:20:48.181
She was gonna have our child,
but he bought her off.


1034
01:20:48.389 --> 01:20:51.184
Just like he buys everybody off.
He tried to buy me off.


1035
01:20:51.389 --> 01:20:53.877
- Put the piece away.
- Remember that night I went there?


1036
01:20:54.088 --> 01:20:56.918
He tried to write a check
so I would leave.


1037
01:20:58.155 --> 01:21:00.485
A check.

1038
01:21:03.556 --> 01:21:06.953
She was gonna have a baby with me.
Tommy, with me.


1039
01:21:07.355 --> 01:21:11.287
- She was gonna have our child.
- Stop waving your gun in my house.


1040
01:21:14.489 --> 01:21:17.011
She was gonna have our child.

1041
01:21:19.022 --> 01:21:23.011
I had no choice.
Man is allowed to do anything..


1042
01:21:23.222 --> 01:21:26.382
if he's protecting his family.
You know I'm right, Tom.


1043
01:21:29.855 --> 01:21:32.083
Still family here?

1044
01:21:33.389 --> 01:21:35.548
We still family?

1045
01:21:40.155 --> 01:21:42.144
It's over, Eddie.

1046
01:21:43.721 --> 01:21:45.880
Oh, God.

1047
01:21:47.556 --> 01:21:50.021
Who's gonna clean you up, Tom?

1048
01:23:04.222 --> 01:23:08.518
Thanks. I'll burn this book
and we'll all sleep better.


1049
01:23:21.755 --> 01:23:25.347
Go on, Tom. We'll clean this up.

1050
01:23:30.721 --> 01:23:32.710
<i>Most people don't know this.</i>

1051
01:23:32.922 --> 01:23:36.581
<i>But when someone dies
in your house and leaves a mess..</i>


1052
01:23:37.088 --> 01:23:40.213
<i>it's up to the
family to clean it up.</i>

1053
01:23:40.988 --> 01:23:44.647
<i>Most people don't have the stomach
for that kind of thing.</i>


1054
01:23:45.222 --> 01:23:47.347
<i>That's where my dad comes in.</i>

1055
01:23:49.588 --> 01:23:52.850
<i>My dad says
that stains have memories.</i>


1056
01:23:53.322 --> 01:23:58.720
<i>They remember their shape,
their color, their smell.</i>


1057
01:24:00.255 --> 01:24:05.153
<i>And the really deep ones
return again and again.</i>


1058
01:24:10.389 --> 01:24:16.844
<i>With these stains, it's easier
to start over than to try cleaning them.</i>


1059
01:24:18.788 --> 01:24:23.686
<i>Sometimes you have a choice.
Sometimes you don't.</i>


1060
01:24:25.621 --> 01:24:29.247
<i>All you can do is hope.</i>
