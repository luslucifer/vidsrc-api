00:02:26.875 --> 00:02:28.275
Randy!

2
00:02:29.962 --> 00:02:31.362
Oh, boy!

3
00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:34.281
Randy!

4
00:02:35.092 --> 00:02:36.867
Come on dammit!

5
00:02:37.302 --> 00:02:38.702
Yo!

6
00:02:39.638 --> 00:02:42.873
Hey, you're missing one
of God's great creations.


7
00:02:44.434 --> 00:02:46.961
The sun's just beginning to peak.

8
00:02:47.729 --> 00:02:50.047
Hubba hubba boy. 
Let's get with it!

9
00:02:50.315 --> 00:02:51.759
I ain't going to tell you again now.

10
00:02:51.859 --> 00:02:53.259
Get out here!

11
00:02:53.402 --> 00:02:57.264
Look dad, you go out,
go on without me.


12
00:02:57.364 --> 00:02:59.058
I'm going to sleep a while longer.

13
00:02:59.158 --> 00:03:00.934
I want you to get dressed,

14
00:03:01.034 --> 00:03:04.019
and get out here on the double!
Hubba! Hubba!


15
00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:07.314
We got a full day ahead of us.

16
00:03:07.875 --> 00:03:10.442
I been up for an hour already!

17
00:03:13.797 --> 00:03:16.200
So you been up for an hour already.

18
00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:17.866
Hubba. Hubba.

19
00:03:21.221 --> 00:03:25.708
Hey! This water smells funny.

20
00:03:27.436 --> 00:03:29.169
It tastes funny too.

21
00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:32.216
It's probably bad water.

22
00:03:32.316 --> 00:03:33.592
The water's good.

23
00:03:33.692 --> 00:03:34.718
Something wrong with you.

24
00:03:34.818 --> 00:03:37.344
It's just fresh, no chemicals.

25
00:03:37.613 --> 00:03:39.723
Now, will you get the lead out?

26
00:03:39.823 --> 00:03:40.682
Well you never know.

27
00:03:40.782 --> 00:03:43.519
I mean, the way industrial waste
gets thrown around these days.


28
00:03:43.619 --> 00:03:45.104
There's probably some big industry up

29
00:03:45.204 --> 00:03:46.772
there that's just
dumping in this river


30
00:03:46.872 --> 00:03:48.592
and polluting the hell out of it.

31
00:03:52.085 --> 00:03:53.569
You looking for something?

32
00:03:53.754 --> 00:03:56.155
Garbage. Trash.

33
00:03:57.674 --> 00:04:00.534
Dad, why does it always
have to be like this?


34
00:04:02.512 --> 00:04:03.831
Like what son?

35
00:04:03.931 --> 00:04:05.457
You and me.

36
00:04:05.557 --> 00:04:08.210
I mean we can never
agree on anything.


37
00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:10.669
We can never be on the same side.

38
00:04:14.191 --> 00:04:15.633
Load it.

39
00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:24.309
Well boy, there's not a feeling
to beat this in the whole world,


40
00:04:24.409 --> 00:04:27.269
nothing in the whole bloody world.

41
00:04:29.706 --> 00:04:32.734
Look, the sun's almost
up all the way now.


42
00:04:32.834 --> 00:04:34.611
Don't you think we've
missed all the animals?


43
00:04:34.711 --> 00:04:37.281
I swear you got that
pessimism from your mother.


44
00:04:37.381 --> 00:04:38.657
You didn't get it from me.

45
00:04:38.757 --> 00:04:42.327
If you'd lived with me all those years
you'd be a man now instead of a sissy.


46
00:04:42.427 --> 00:04:45.039
Being a man doesn't mean I have
to come out here with a big gun


47
00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:47.753
and shoot little animals that
aren't even a threat to me.


48
00:04:51.603 --> 00:04:53.671
I missed the son of a bitch.

49
00:04:57.567 --> 00:05:00.344
What's the matter son? Scare you?

50
00:05:02.531 --> 00:05:06.517
Now, what was it you were
saying to me about being a man?


51
00:05:08.036 --> 00:05:10.938
Forget it.
Probably wouldn't understand.


52
00:05:11.081 --> 00:05:12.856
Well there's good hunting left.

53
00:05:13.375 --> 00:05:15.319
I'm going to get me some game today,

54
00:05:15.419 --> 00:05:19.154
one way or the other,
I'm going to shoot me something.


55
00:06:43.882 --> 00:06:46.285
Help! Help!

56
00:06:46.385 --> 00:06:47.911
Help!

57
00:06:48.011 --> 00:06:49.536
Help me son!

58
00:07:05.570 --> 00:07:07.597
Should be fun at the lake today, huh?

59
00:07:07.697 --> 00:07:08.974
Yeah. You'll like Greg.

60
00:07:09.074 --> 00:07:10.892
Well, what do you know about him?

61
00:07:10.992 --> 00:07:13.894
He's a friend of Tom's, that's all.

62
00:07:14.121 --> 00:07:17.399
Look at, Tom would not set you
up with a geek, you know?


63
00:07:17.499 --> 00:07:19.901
This is money in the bank.
I'm serious.


64
00:07:20.001 --> 00:07:22.571
- You think so? Huh?
- I'm not kidding. You'll see.


65
00:07:22.671 --> 00:07:25.572
That's cool Beth, take your time.
That's good.


66
00:07:26.842 --> 00:07:28.283
I mean that's cool.

67
00:07:32.431 --> 00:07:33.999
Hi, Tom. How you doing?

68
00:07:34.099 --> 00:07:35.499
Hi, Tom.

69
00:07:39.521 --> 00:07:40.964
Would you say hello to her please?

70
00:07:41.064 --> 00:07:42.799
Hello. Hello.

71
00:07:42.899 --> 00:07:44.301
Look, you'll be safe with Greg.

72
00:07:44.401 --> 00:07:46.385
I personally guarantee it. Okay?

73
00:07:48.780 --> 00:07:50.264
Let's go.

74
00:07:56.746 --> 00:07:58.397
Off to the mountains.

75
00:08:36.620 --> 00:08:38.353
Huh, it looks like it's closed.

76
00:08:41.875 --> 00:08:43.775
Do you believe this?

77
00:08:44.336 --> 00:08:45.320
Typical.

78
00:08:45.420 --> 00:08:47.072
I've got to go to the ladies room.

79
00:08:47.172 --> 00:08:48.947
I'll go with you.

80
00:08:49.799 --> 00:08:52.868
Yeah, all right. Go ahead.
I'll get the gas.


81
00:08:53.470 --> 00:08:54.912
What is that?

82
00:08:55.013 --> 00:08:56.705
Somebody shot a bobcat.

83
00:08:57.891 --> 00:08:59.833
Gosh, that's horrible.

84
00:09:00.352 --> 00:09:02.312
It's all right.
It's dead now. Go ahead.


85
00:09:14.991 --> 00:09:16.101
There it is.

86
00:09:16.201 --> 00:09:17.601
Great.

87
00:09:20.664 --> 00:09:22.314
Terrific. It's locked.

88
00:09:22.499 --> 00:09:24.441
Why don't you try the men's room?

89
00:09:26.711 --> 00:09:29.029
Great. The story of
my life, you know.


90
00:09:30.382 --> 00:09:31.700
Sandy, don't start laughing.

91
00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:34.201
Cause if you start laughing,
then I'm in trouble.


92
00:09:35.387 --> 00:09:37.204
I'm not laughing.

93
00:09:37.305 --> 00:09:38.830
Sandy!

94
00:09:53.238 --> 00:09:55.056
What the hell are you doing in here?

95
00:09:55.156 --> 00:09:56.475
This is the men's latrine.

96
00:09:56.575 --> 00:09:58.642
Well my girlfriend, she needed it,

97
00:09:59.077 --> 00:10:01.645
and the women's room was...

98
00:10:03.081 --> 00:10:04.690
What's that mean?

99
00:10:05.333 --> 00:10:06.733
Huh?

100
00:10:10.964 --> 00:10:14.533
No chance, no help, no escape.

101
00:10:16.803 --> 00:10:19.246
I can't figure kids out today.

102
00:10:31.735 --> 00:10:33.468
Where the hell is everyone?

103
00:10:34.321 --> 00:10:35.887
Amazing.

104
00:10:37.657 --> 00:10:39.100
Maybe that doesn't matter.

105
00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:40.976
These old pumps don't lock.

106
00:10:41.911 --> 00:10:43.562
Crank that up for me will you?

107
00:10:49.169 --> 00:10:52.571
So, what do you think of Sandy?

108
00:10:53.381 --> 00:10:55.449
Seems like a very nice girl.

109
00:10:59.721 --> 00:11:01.081
So where are they?

110
00:11:01.181 --> 00:11:02.958
Women, in the bathroom, right?

111
00:11:03.058 --> 00:11:04.376
Here they are now.

112
00:11:04.476 --> 00:11:05.585
Are you ready?

113
00:11:05.685 --> 00:11:07.711
Yeah, well we had to
use the men's room.


114
00:11:07.854 --> 00:11:10.882
You know, you guys write really
weird things on bathroom walls.


115
00:11:10.982 --> 00:11:12.217
What are you talking about?

116
00:11:12.317 --> 00:11:16.304
Somebody wrote no chance,
no help, no escape.


117
00:11:16.404 --> 00:11:19.014
Yeah, and there was a
strange man in there too.


118
00:11:19.449 --> 00:11:21.975
- Is he still in there?
- No.


119
00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:24.229
Let's get out of here,
we don't have to pay for the gas.


120
00:11:24.329 --> 00:11:26.104
What do you mean? 
Wait a minute.

121
00:11:26.456 --> 00:11:28.273
Come on. Let's pay for the gas.

122
00:11:29.834 --> 00:11:31.069
Hey come on, Tom. Huh?

123
00:11:31.169 --> 00:11:32.753
I mean, it's not like it's a
big oil company or something.


124
00:11:32.854 --> 00:11:35.372
- Let's pay them.
- Well, I'm paying.


125
00:11:38.343 --> 00:11:40.704
- Hello?
- Hello?


126
00:11:40.804 --> 00:11:42.496
Anybody home?

127
00:11:47.394 --> 00:11:48.835
What is this?

128
00:11:49.938 --> 00:11:51.256
Let's get out of here, you guys.

129
00:11:51.356 --> 00:11:53.091
This place really
gives me the creeps.


130
00:11:53.191 --> 00:11:54.841
Hey, wait a second.

131
00:11:55.485 --> 00:11:57.052
Baby rats.

132
00:11:58.279 --> 00:12:01.640
Sandy look at...
Oh, gosh, isn't it cute?


133
00:12:03.326 --> 00:12:05.185
I think we better get out of here.

134
00:12:13.545 --> 00:12:15.779
What the hell are you
kids doing in here?


135
00:12:18.550 --> 00:12:19.993
We were looking for you.

136
00:12:20.093 --> 00:12:23.286
We were going to pay for
the gas we took outside.


137
00:12:24.472 --> 00:12:26.414
We took $10, here's $20.

138
00:12:35.066 --> 00:12:36.883
$12.80.

139
00:12:38.653 --> 00:12:40.512
Ain't seen you kids before.

140
00:12:41.364 --> 00:12:42.891
What are you doing around here?

141
00:12:42.991 --> 00:12:44.933
We were just going to the lake.

142
00:12:45.034 --> 00:12:48.938
Oh, I'd stay away from
there if I was you.


143
00:12:49.038 --> 00:12:50.480
How come?

144
00:12:52.876 --> 00:12:55.777
Well, it's hunting season.

145
00:12:57.505 --> 00:12:59.948
There's been more than
one accident over there


146
00:13:00.341 --> 00:13:02.369
with strangers in these parts.

147
00:13:02.469 --> 00:13:05.413
I guess we might get mistaken
for some deer or something.


148
00:13:05.513 --> 00:13:07.956
Look, I'm telling you.

149
00:13:09.434 --> 00:13:11.334
Don't go down to the lake.

150
00:13:15.899 --> 00:13:17.591
Did you shoot all these animals?

151
00:13:17.984 --> 00:13:19.886
Yeah, that's right.
Every one of them.


152
00:13:19.986 --> 00:13:21.428
Why?

153
00:13:31.748 --> 00:13:33.608
You've never been hunting have you?

154
00:13:33.708 --> 00:13:36.194
No, and I don't plan to either.

155
00:13:36.294 --> 00:13:41.031
Oh, it's a good sport,
as long as you follow the rules.


156
00:13:41.299 --> 00:13:43.950
Yeah, well I don't
see it as a sport.

157
00:13:44.385 --> 00:13:46.620
I don't think I could
ever kill an animal.


158
00:13:47.222 --> 00:13:49.956
Well it depends on the animal
and who's doing the hunting.


159
00:13:51.476 --> 00:13:54.711
Besides, I never kill for the sport.

160
00:13:55.271 --> 00:13:58.758
I eat what I kill, and the
sport is in the tracking


161
00:13:58.858 --> 00:14:02.385
and the hunting, not in the kill.

162
00:14:02.987 --> 00:14:07.350
Yeah, well that's wonderful, but,
I think we should really be going.


163
00:14:07.450 --> 00:14:09.935
Yeah, yeah let's go.
Come on, come on. Let's go.


164
00:14:15.333 --> 00:14:19.277
I'm telling you kids not to go
down to the lake, please.


165
00:14:19.879 --> 00:14:22.447
It's full of hunters
this time of year now.


166
00:14:22.799 --> 00:14:24.324
I'm warning you.

167
00:14:26.302 --> 00:14:27.827
Okay.

168
00:14:28.429 --> 00:14:30.455
Okay, we won't go to the lake.

169
00:14:30.557 --> 00:14:32.540
We won't go.

170
00:14:32.642 --> 00:14:34.042
All right.

171
00:14:39.607 --> 00:14:41.967
That guy has a real cheerful outlook.

172
00:15:09.804 --> 00:15:13.957
Mine eyes have seen the glory
of the coming of the Lord.


173
00:15:17.061 --> 00:15:23.925
72 bottles of beer on the wall

174
00:15:26.988 --> 00:15:28.763
All right men, halt.

175
00:15:28.907 --> 00:15:30.682
Check rations and ammo.

176
00:15:31.284 --> 00:15:33.164
We're going to camp here for a while.

177
00:15:33.953 --> 00:15:38.148
Now, I want to talk with you men.

178
00:15:38.791 --> 00:15:43.154
All my life I have wanted
to lead a troop of men


179
00:15:43.254 --> 00:15:46.406
like you into the wilderness.

180
00:15:47.216 --> 00:15:48.993
Today is the day.

181
00:15:49.093 --> 00:15:52.329
I am leading you into the wilderness.

182
00:15:52.680 --> 00:15:55.542
Now, these are hallowed mountains.

183
00:15:55.642 --> 00:15:58.753
A great Indian tribe called the Guapo

184
00:15:58.853 --> 00:16:01.589
lived, hunted,
roamed in these tribes.


185
00:16:01.689 --> 00:16:05.718
They weren't like the Apache or
the Iroquois or the Chippewa.


186
00:16:05.818 --> 00:16:07.469
Did they kill Custer?

187
00:16:09.197 --> 00:16:15.977
No. No. The Guapo were
famous for raising beans.


188
00:16:16.120 --> 00:16:20.815
They were a bean raising tribe.

189
00:16:22.961 --> 00:16:26.531
But being a scout, one is never lost,

190
00:16:26.631 --> 00:16:29.908
because we have our compass and we...

191
00:16:31.719 --> 00:16:38.291
You can see, see by the...

192
00:16:39.978 --> 00:16:43.506
Now this stream,
this goes downstream,


193
00:16:43.606 --> 00:16:46.426
and all streams empty into a lake,

194
00:16:46.526 --> 00:16:51.137
and the lake empties
into the ocean. Doesn't it?


195
00:16:51.322 --> 00:16:52.348
Of course it does.

196
00:16:52.448 --> 00:16:56.394
Now, boys, men,
without leaving this trail,


197
00:16:56.494 --> 00:17:00.273
I want you to pick up
a rock or a branch,


198
00:17:00.373 --> 00:17:03.192
and bring it home to mom and
dad as a memento of our trip.


199
00:17:03.292 --> 00:17:07.779
No rattlesnakes though,
because rattlesnakes carry germs.


200
00:17:07.964 --> 00:17:09.614
All right men. Dismissed.

201
00:17:49.714 --> 00:17:51.114
Hey!

202
00:17:52.175 --> 00:17:53.616
Anybody home?

203
00:17:58.598 --> 00:17:59.998
Anybody home?

204
00:18:16.449 --> 00:18:17.932
Hello there!

205
00:18:18.493 --> 00:18:20.059
Anybody home?

206
00:18:22.121 --> 00:18:23.855
I could use some help.

207
00:18:25.041 --> 00:18:26.774
Anybody in there?

208
00:18:28.628 --> 00:18:33.031
I've got some cub scouts
down the way and...


209
00:18:33.674 --> 00:18:35.827
And my blisters are killing me.

210
00:18:35.927 --> 00:18:37.327
Hello?

211
00:18:56.572 --> 00:18:58.681
Anybody out there?

212
00:19:16.634 --> 00:19:18.117
Anybody there?

213
00:19:35.945 --> 00:19:37.387
Come on now.

214
00:22:45.468 --> 00:22:47.702
Huh? Huh? Huh?

215
00:22:48.554 --> 00:22:49.622
Sensational.

216
00:22:49.722 --> 00:22:52.124
Sensational. The man
says only sensational.


217
00:22:52.224 --> 00:22:54.043
- All right, it's great.
- Great.


218
00:22:54.143 --> 00:22:56.128
Hey, you don't think the guy
at the station was right?


219
00:22:56.228 --> 00:22:57.922
I mean some crazy
hunter's going to...


220
00:22:58.022 --> 00:22:59.548
I'm sure we're safe, Sandy.

221
00:22:59.648 --> 00:23:02.383
We're just going to have
some fun. It will be all right.


222
00:23:03.235 --> 00:23:05.636
Last one in gets stuffed and mounted.

223
00:23:07.365 --> 00:23:08.931
Well, ready?

224
00:23:16.624 --> 00:23:18.775
All right. Come on Sandy, it's great!

225
00:23:20.252 --> 00:23:21.861
All right!

226
00:23:50.324 --> 00:23:51.933
Want to go for a walk?

227
00:23:58.207 --> 00:24:01.110
You know when I was a kid, I could
have fixed this thing very easily.


228
00:24:01.210 --> 00:24:02.820
I used to have a ham radio set,

229
00:24:02.920 --> 00:24:05.197
and I used to sit up all night long
and listen for distress signals.


230
00:24:05.297 --> 00:24:06.699
- Yeah?
- Yeah.


231
00:24:06.799 --> 00:24:07.992
Well did you ever hear any?

232
00:24:08.092 --> 00:24:10.494
Yeah, yeah one time I
even sent an ambulance


233
00:24:10.594 --> 00:24:13.080
to an accident and got
my picture in the paper.


234
00:24:13.180 --> 00:24:14.580
Yeah?

235
00:24:23.691 --> 00:24:25.451
Why are you putting your shirt on?

236
00:24:27.695 --> 00:24:29.220
You want me to take it off?

237
00:24:29.947 --> 00:24:31.347
Come here.

238
00:25:01.562 --> 00:25:03.672
You know, it's the silliest thing.

239
00:25:03.772 --> 00:25:06.132
This thing was working
so well yesterday.


240
00:25:06.275 --> 00:25:07.884
I don't like that sound.

241
00:25:08.486 --> 00:25:11.012
It makes me feel lost
and far away from home.


242
00:25:15.367 --> 00:25:17.602
It must be coming from
a long ways away huh?


243
00:25:17.912 --> 00:25:19.395
Yeah.

244
00:25:20.289 --> 00:25:22.191
Well, you think they're
through at the lake?


245
00:25:22.291 --> 00:25:23.025
Yeah.

246
00:25:23.125 --> 00:25:24.610
- Should we get back?
- Yeah.


247
00:25:24.710 --> 00:25:26.110
Okay.

248
00:25:43.437 --> 00:25:44.837
Tom?

249
00:25:46.357 --> 00:25:47.757
Beth?

250
00:25:49.818 --> 00:25:51.302
I wonder where they are?

251
00:25:51.862 --> 00:25:54.597
Well, if I know Tom,
they're in the back of the van.


252
00:26:01.080 --> 00:26:04.023
Tom, hello? We're back.

253
00:26:04.333 --> 00:26:05.651
Beth?

254
00:26:05.751 --> 00:26:07.652
Hey guys we're back. Hey.

255
00:26:12.049 --> 00:26:14.241
We're back. Hello?

256
00:26:15.886 --> 00:26:17.328
They're not there.

257
00:26:18.806 --> 00:26:20.124
Maybe they went for a walk.

258
00:26:20.224 --> 00:26:22.084
I'm getting kind of cold.
How about you?


259
00:26:22.184 --> 00:26:24.126
Yeah, yeah. I'm hungry.

260
00:26:24.937 --> 00:26:26.879
Well, there's food in the van.

261
00:26:27.022 --> 00:26:29.215
All right. Let's get some.

262
00:26:34.071 --> 00:26:35.306
Where the hell are those guys?

263
00:26:35.406 --> 00:26:36.724
How could they do this?

264
00:26:36.824 --> 00:26:38.934
I mean they've been
gone over an hour.


265
00:26:39.034 --> 00:26:41.145
They've got to know we're going to
be worried about them, don't they?


266
00:26:41.245 --> 00:26:43.354
Yeah, well I'm worried.

267
00:26:43.914 --> 00:26:45.523
I mean this is stupid.

268
00:26:45.791 --> 00:26:47.858
I hate it when people
do things like this.


269
00:26:49.003 --> 00:26:50.279
It drives me crazy.

270
00:26:50.379 --> 00:26:51.988
Well, what do you want to do?

271
00:26:52.881 --> 00:26:54.615
Well, look for them I guess.

272
00:26:55.426 --> 00:26:57.244
Let's try this path here.

273
00:26:57.344 --> 00:26:58.828
I'm right behind you.

274
00:27:06.854 --> 00:27:08.254
It goes through here.

275
00:27:08.355 --> 00:27:09.755
Okay.

276
00:27:11.525 --> 00:27:12.925
Watch your step.

277
00:27:20.576 --> 00:27:22.268
Through here I think.

278
00:27:23.245 --> 00:27:25.314
They wouldn't have gone
through here, would they?


279
00:27:25.414 --> 00:27:28.566
Yeah, they did. Look, you can see.
Now come on.


280
00:28:03.827 --> 00:28:06.228
Sandy! Sandy!

281
00:28:07.164 --> 00:28:08.647
Are you all right?

282
00:28:09.083 --> 00:28:10.775
Yeah, I'm okay.

283
00:28:27.851 --> 00:28:29.293
Give me your hand.

284
00:28:31.021 --> 00:28:34.548
Nice and easy. Okay. Okay. Okay.

285
00:28:34.983 --> 00:28:37.968
- You all right?
- Yeah. I'm okay.


286
00:28:38.320 --> 00:28:40.764
We got to get out of here. Tom and
Beth could be in one of these.


287
00:28:40.864 --> 00:28:44.233
- Okay, come on.
- Wait, what's that?


288
00:28:45.994 --> 00:28:49.772
I don't know. Come on,
let's check it out.


289
00:28:49.873 --> 00:28:51.398
Easy, easy.

290
00:29:01.051 --> 00:29:02.451
What do you think?

291
00:29:03.470 --> 00:29:04.870
I don't know.

292
00:29:22.906 --> 00:29:24.348
Water department.

293
00:30:49.868 --> 00:30:51.268
Keys?

294
00:30:51.453 --> 00:30:53.062
Keys! Where are the keys?

295
00:31:19.773 --> 00:31:22.633
It's eating through the windshield.

296
00:31:38.250 --> 00:31:40.359
What's that sound?

297
00:31:42.379 --> 00:31:44.947
Something's trying to get
in through the side door.


298
00:31:55.726 --> 00:31:56.877
Hey here are the keys.

299
00:31:56.977 --> 00:31:59.003
Greg, do something.

300
00:32:02.274 --> 00:32:03.801
Get out of here!

301
00:32:03.901 --> 00:32:05.426
All right. All right.

302
00:32:12.534 --> 00:32:13.934
Come on start!

303
00:32:22.044 --> 00:32:24.153
All right. All right.

304
00:32:40.437 --> 00:32:41.588
What is that?

305
00:32:41.688 --> 00:32:43.168
I don't know. I don't know.

306
00:33:00.999 --> 00:33:02.943
Try the windshield wipers.

307
00:33:03.043 --> 00:33:04.735
Okay.

308
00:33:49.506 --> 00:33:53.826
I'm... I'm going to
find some help. I'm...


309
00:33:54.970 --> 00:33:56.288
Where are we?

310
00:33:56.388 --> 00:33:58.539
Some kind of country bar.

311
00:33:59.057 --> 00:34:02.334
I'm going to go inside and try
and find somebody to help us.


312
00:34:03.145 --> 00:34:04.087
I'm going with you.

313
00:34:04.187 --> 00:34:06.715
No, no. You stay here.

314
00:34:06.815 --> 00:34:08.382
I don't know what's going on.

315
00:34:09.192 --> 00:34:12.553
I'm... I'm going to be right back.
You lock the door.


316
00:34:13.030 --> 00:34:14.471
I'll be right back.

317
00:34:19.870 --> 00:34:21.270
You'll be safe.

318
00:34:30.630 --> 00:34:35.033
Hey, you ever find that
long-lost wife of yours, Leo?


319
00:34:37.137 --> 00:34:39.413
No, but I didn't look
very hard either.


320
00:34:43.435 --> 00:34:45.337
Hi, hi son! Come on in.

321
00:34:45.437 --> 00:34:47.087
Take any seat in the joint.

322
00:34:47.481 --> 00:34:51.091
Our friends are dead.

323
00:34:53.570 --> 00:34:56.722
Well what happened.

324
00:34:57.157 --> 00:34:58.974
They've been murdered.

325
00:34:59.576 --> 00:35:01.520
Well come on in. Sit down.

326
00:35:01.620 --> 00:35:03.188
Take it easy. Relax.

327
00:35:03.288 --> 00:35:04.648
Give the kid a beer Ivy.

328
00:35:04.748 --> 00:35:06.565
No, no. I need help.

329
00:35:06.708 --> 00:35:08.068
I need some help.

330
00:35:08.168 --> 00:35:10.777
My friends, my friends are dead.

331
00:35:14.758 --> 00:35:17.119
Please lady. Call the police.

332
00:35:17.219 --> 00:35:20.454
Now calm down, son. Calm down.

333
00:35:20.931 --> 00:35:24.167
You've got to tell us a little more
before we call in the sheriff.


334
00:35:24.267 --> 00:35:26.753
Please lady come on. 
Call the police.

335
00:35:26.853 --> 00:35:30.507
All right. I will.
Just start from the start.


336
00:35:30.607 --> 00:35:33.717
Tell me what happened
and I'll call the police.


337
00:36:04.641 --> 00:36:08.962
It was some kind off lying creature.

338
00:36:09.062 --> 00:36:11.214
They hit our van.

339
00:36:11.314 --> 00:36:12.090
They were like...

340
00:36:12.190 --> 00:36:14.134
Hey Sarge, come here.

341
00:36:14.234 --> 00:36:16.426
Just a second fellows.

342
00:36:23.285 --> 00:36:25.811
I just taught this
recruit another lesson.


343
00:36:26.830 --> 00:36:28.522
This round's on Bill.

344
00:36:31.751 --> 00:36:32.694
Yeah, what is it?

345
00:36:32.794 --> 00:36:36.405
Hey Sarge, this guy
here a friend of yours?


346
00:36:38.675 --> 00:36:40.327
No, never seen him before.

347
00:36:40.427 --> 00:36:42.954
Well he says he's seen some
of your flying saucers.


348
00:36:43.054 --> 00:36:44.454
Yeah.

349
00:36:46.474 --> 00:36:48.250
You seen them little critters?

350
00:36:48.768 --> 00:36:50.335
The flying critters.

351
00:36:50.437 --> 00:36:53.171
Yeah, yeah. They attacked our van.

352
00:36:53.648 --> 00:36:55.591
Feisty little things ain't they?

353
00:36:56.776 --> 00:36:59.177
Are you two guys in
cahoots here, Sarge?


354
00:37:00.280 --> 00:37:03.934
Did you pay this guy to come in
here and spread your crazy stories?


355
00:37:04.034 --> 00:37:05.268
Look, I'm warning you!

356
00:37:05.368 --> 00:37:08.063
When they start eating on you,
don't come to me for help.


357
00:37:08.163 --> 00:37:09.981
Cause you ain't getting any.

358
00:37:10.081 --> 00:37:12.399
Come on Sarge. Lighten up.

359
00:37:14.211 --> 00:37:16.154
I told you they were going to attack.

360
00:37:16.254 --> 00:37:17.654
I said so.

361
00:37:18.256 --> 00:37:21.199
It's happening Aggie.
I knew it was going to happen.


362
00:37:21.301 --> 00:37:24.286
I told you. We've got to
prepare for invasion.


363
00:37:24.763 --> 00:37:27.789
Lady please.
I'm telling you the truth.


364
00:37:28.099 --> 00:37:30.335
If you don't believe me,
ask my girl in the van.


365
00:37:30.435 --> 00:37:33.296
What? There's a girl outside
who's seen those critters?


366
00:37:33.396 --> 00:37:34.796
Yeah.

367
00:37:37.901 --> 00:37:39.136
Let's bring her in here.

368
00:37:39.236 --> 00:37:40.720
We're going to go out and get her.

369
00:37:40.820 --> 00:37:42.679
Then you'll believe me. Come on.

370
00:37:46.284 --> 00:37:47.809
Sandy, I've got help!

371
00:37:48.536 --> 00:37:49.936
Sandy!

372
00:37:50.622 --> 00:37:51.815
Sandy.

373
00:37:51.915 --> 00:37:53.315
She in there boy?

374
00:37:54.251 --> 00:37:55.569
Sandy!

375
00:37:55.669 --> 00:37:56.611
Where is she?

376
00:37:56.711 --> 00:37:58.111
I don't know.

377
00:38:01.424 --> 00:38:02.908
Sandy!

378
00:38:05.887 --> 00:38:07.412
They must have captured her.

379
00:38:10.934 --> 00:38:13.170
No soldier. Not at night.

380
00:38:13.270 --> 00:38:14.921
They've got the edge in the dark.

381
00:38:15.021 --> 00:38:16.339
They'll stalk you out
and you won't see them


382
00:38:16.439 --> 00:38:18.507
until they bury
themselves in your guts.


383
00:38:19.109 --> 00:38:21.303
- Look I'm just...
- Don't give me any of your lip.


384
00:38:21.403 --> 00:38:24.014
I'm in command here.
You do as you're told.


385
00:38:24.114 --> 00:38:26.139
Your job is to take orders.

386
00:38:26.408 --> 00:38:28.185
Leave him alone.

387
00:38:28.285 --> 00:38:31.436
Sarge, you are not
in the Army no more.


388
00:38:40.005 --> 00:38:43.198
Don't let him scare you.

389
00:38:44.676 --> 00:38:47.202
He's never hurt nobody before.

390
00:38:48.430 --> 00:38:52.834
See, he's, he's suffered a lot, and,

391
00:38:52.934 --> 00:38:56.712
he gets carried away,
forgets where he is.


392
00:38:57.397 --> 00:38:59.716
I'll call the police for you.

393
00:38:59.816 --> 00:39:01.009
Why don't you come on inside?

394
00:39:01.109 --> 00:39:02.177
I mean you can't look
for your girlfriend


395
00:39:02.277 --> 00:39:04.262
out here in the dark
by yourself anyway.


396
00:39:04.362 --> 00:39:05.887
So, come on.

397
00:39:06.364 --> 00:39:13.395
No chance. No help. No escape.

398
00:39:23.256 --> 00:39:24.740
The girl wasn't there.

399
00:39:25.133 --> 00:39:28.660
You sit here son,
and I'll call the police.


400
00:39:30.138 --> 00:39:31.788
Hey Sarge.

401
00:39:32.015 --> 00:39:33.041
Huh?

402
00:39:33.141 --> 00:39:34.960
Everything all right out there?

403
00:39:35.060 --> 00:39:38.546
You know Dave, Dave you
ought to be thanking me,


404
00:39:38.646 --> 00:39:40.173
but you're like every other damn

405
00:39:40.273 --> 00:39:42.676
fool in this country,
always ready to retreat.


406
00:39:42.776 --> 00:39:44.886
That's why we haven't won
a war in over 35 years.


407
00:39:44.986 --> 00:39:47.846
I mean you wouldn't see a warning if
it was staring you right in the face.


408
00:39:51.409 --> 00:39:53.351
Makes perfect sense to me.

409
00:39:53.828 --> 00:39:56.104
They start out here in the country.

410
00:39:56.790 --> 00:39:59.317
They establish a foothold,
and after they got us


411
00:39:59.417 --> 00:40:01.152
they move in on the cities.

412
00:40:01.252 --> 00:40:03.612
That way they've got
a base to fight from.


413
00:40:10.887 --> 00:40:13.288
I'll be damned if they
get me without a fight.


414
00:40:15.892 --> 00:40:18.627
They're not going to get
Sergeant Fred Dobbs easy.


415
00:40:20.522 --> 00:40:22.088
Not this time.

416
00:40:27.779 --> 00:40:29.639
The Sheriff will be
here in a little while.


417
00:40:29.739 --> 00:40:32.891
He's catching a pack of lost
cub scouts from the city.


418
00:40:33.118 --> 00:40:35.770
Aggie, get me another beer,
would you?


419
00:40:35.870 --> 00:40:38.773
Sure, Leo. Why don't you have
another one, and another one.


420
00:40:38.873 --> 00:40:40.899
That way you can get good and drunk.

421
00:40:41.126 --> 00:40:43.820
You won't feel anything when
they start eating you alive.


422
00:40:43.920 --> 00:40:46.321
You know Sarge,
if I didn't know any better,


423
00:40:46.464 --> 00:40:49.326
I'd say you got out of the
service on a section 8.


424
00:40:49.426 --> 00:40:51.201
I got an honorable discharge.

425
00:40:52.053 --> 00:40:54.456
Oh, sure, I had a
little trouble with the


426
00:40:54.556 --> 00:40:57.082
yellow belly chicken brass, but I...

427
00:40:58.893 --> 00:41:03.088
I got out on an honorable discharge
after 26 years of service.


428
00:41:13.992 --> 00:41:17.145
I think this belongs to you.

429
00:41:17.245 --> 00:41:20.397
Sandy. Sandy.

430
00:41:28.006 --> 00:41:29.573
She's going to be all right.

431
00:41:30.467 --> 00:41:34.077
I found her out there in the woods
running like a scared rabbit.


432
00:41:37.307 --> 00:41:41.459
Greg, thank God.
I saw it. It was horrible.


433
00:41:41.853 --> 00:41:43.713
You seen it? You seen the creature?

434
00:41:43.813 --> 00:41:45.507
Yeah, it was huge.

435
00:41:45.607 --> 00:41:47.384
That's how the bodies
got in the shack.


436
00:41:47.484 --> 00:41:49.135
I'm going to get you
kids something to eat.


437
00:41:49.235 --> 00:41:50.887
You need some food in your stomachs.

438
00:41:50.987 --> 00:41:51.971
Thank you.

439
00:41:52.071 --> 00:41:53.390
You guys never been in combat.

440
00:41:53.490 --> 00:41:54.808
You don't know.

441
00:41:54.908 --> 00:41:57.726
I'm telling you, the enemy
is out there right now,


442
00:41:58.661 --> 00:42:00.186
killing people!

443
00:42:03.583 --> 00:42:06.528
You found the shack where
it stores the bodies?


444
00:42:06.628 --> 00:42:09.779
Yeah. They're hanging on hooks.

445
00:42:10.673 --> 00:42:12.198
Like animals.

446
00:42:17.805 --> 00:42:22.751
Oh, damn. Not again.
Don't worry, I'll light the lamps.


447
00:42:51.256 --> 00:42:54.242
This is the first step.
Cut off the electricity.


448
00:42:54.342 --> 00:42:55.742
I've seen it before.

449
00:42:55.885 --> 00:42:57.954
Oh, Fred, knock it off will you?

450
00:42:58.054 --> 00:42:59.080
Attack in the dark.

451
00:42:59.180 --> 00:43:00.748
They'll have the advantage then.

452
00:43:00.848 --> 00:43:03.750
Fred, stop it. Right now.

453
00:43:05.436 --> 00:43:07.587
It's just the power company again.

454
00:43:07.897 --> 00:43:11.508
Yeah? That's just what
they want you to believe.


455
00:43:11.985 --> 00:43:13.385
I know.

456
00:43:13.736 --> 00:43:16.805
Sarge, we've been having
power outs for years.


457
00:43:18.241 --> 00:43:20.308
Yeah, there's nothing
to be scared of.


458
00:43:24.414 --> 00:43:28.066
I may need your help, 
Joe, with Fred.

459
00:43:31.838 --> 00:43:34.699
What'd you say?
What'd you say about me?


460
00:43:34.799 --> 00:43:38.578
I said the meat in the
freezer is going to


461
00:43:38.678 --> 00:43:41.830
get thawed if the power
don't get turned back on.


462
00:43:42.599 --> 00:43:44.334
Now stop being so jumpy.

463
00:43:44.434 --> 00:43:46.334
You're getting everybody all scared.

464
00:43:48.104 --> 00:43:49.713
Did you hear that?

465
00:43:51.649 --> 00:43:53.049
Yeah.

466
00:43:56.988 --> 00:43:59.014
I figured it would be just like this.

467
00:43:59.365 --> 00:44:03.351
Isolate us and then
take us one at a time.


468
00:44:03.911 --> 00:44:05.988
Look, I know you don't believe
me but I don't give a damn


469
00:44:06.089 --> 00:44:10.225
because I know what I'm saying is true,
and you're too blind to see it.


470
00:44:11.669 --> 00:44:14.738
You think we're the only living
creatures in this universe?


471
00:44:14.839 --> 00:44:18.076
You think with all those stars out there
we're the only things that exist?


472
00:44:18.176 --> 00:44:21.661
Well, I got news for you. We ain't!

473
00:44:21.888 --> 00:44:23.371
We ain't alone!

474
00:44:23.514 --> 00:44:26.167
Supposing we ain't alone,
supposing there's a


475
00:44:26.267 --> 00:44:30.421
whole bunch of aliens
like you say, monsters,


476
00:44:30.521 --> 00:44:32.882
supposing there's a whole
bunch of spaceships


477
00:44:32.982 --> 00:44:35.385
parked in the parking
lot right over the hill.


478
00:44:35.485 --> 00:44:38.344
Supposing it's all true,
like you say, then why in


479
00:44:38.905 --> 00:44:42.850
the hell ain't the CIA,
the FBI and your own Army


480
00:44:42.950 --> 00:44:45.101
done something about it?

481
00:44:46.788 --> 00:44:51.483
Because they never do
nothing about nothing.


482
00:44:57.715 --> 00:44:59.532
Tell me about the shack.

483
00:44:59.884 --> 00:45:01.993
You said the bodies were hanging.

484
00:45:03.721 --> 00:45:05.497
Can you find it again?

485
00:45:10.186 --> 00:45:12.670
Aliens ain't human you know.

486
00:45:13.981 --> 00:45:16.257
They could take human form.

487
00:45:16.609 --> 00:45:19.761
All right Fred. All right,
I ain't listening to no more.


488
00:45:20.530 --> 00:45:22.056
All right, you don't believe me!

489
00:45:22.156 --> 00:45:23.850
So, I'm going to go
out there and find...


490
00:45:23.950 --> 00:45:25.350
Hold it!

491
00:45:26.994 --> 00:45:28.728
You're scaring the women.

492
00:45:29.080 --> 00:45:30.814
Why don't you sit down?

493
00:45:34.627 --> 00:45:36.069
Sandy, what's the matter?

494
00:45:37.004 --> 00:45:40.490
I don't know.
I feel something, a chill.


495
00:45:48.433 --> 00:45:51.459
No! Oh, my God. Oh, no, Ben.

496
00:45:51.811 --> 00:45:56.589
Oh, my God. Oh, no. Oh, Ben.

497
00:45:59.277 --> 00:46:01.302
He's still breathing.
Call an ambulance.


498
00:46:05.324 --> 00:46:08.726
I didn't mean it. 
It was a mistake.

499
00:46:09.579 --> 00:46:14.359
I mean, something came over me.

500
00:46:14.459 --> 00:46:17.402
Something possessed me. I didn't...

501
00:46:23.342 --> 00:46:25.618
It's all your fault.

502
00:46:26.262 --> 00:46:29.038
It all started when you come in.

503
00:46:29.140 --> 00:46:31.292
Look mister, I don't know
what you're talking about.


504
00:46:31.392 --> 00:46:35.421
Yeah, that's when it started,
after you came in.


505
00:46:35.521 --> 00:46:37.589
All the lights and the noise.

506
00:46:37.899 --> 00:46:40.176
You've done enough for tonight Sarge.

507
00:46:40.276 --> 00:46:41.759
Give me the gun.

508
00:46:44.405 --> 00:46:48.266
You stay out of this.
You don't know what's going on here.


509
00:46:48.743 --> 00:46:50.663
You don't know what's
in control here.


510
00:46:51.537 --> 00:46:53.021
The gun.

511
00:46:54.165 --> 00:46:56.776
Get out of my way, Taylor.
I'm the only one


512
00:46:56.876 --> 00:46:58.860
who knows what's going on here.

513
00:47:00.129 --> 00:47:01.738
I'm the only one.

514
00:47:01.923 --> 00:47:04.157
I'm the only one who can protect us.

515
00:47:19.357 --> 00:47:20.758
You kids get outside.

516
00:47:20.858 --> 00:47:22.842
Don't let them out of your sight. No!

517
00:47:24.904 --> 00:47:26.471
Keep him in here.

518
00:47:27.490 --> 00:47:28.725
Don't let them go Taylor.

519
00:47:28.825 --> 00:47:31.184
Taylor! Don't let them go.

520
00:47:32.286 --> 00:47:34.395
You'll regret this Taylor!

521
00:48:17.373 --> 00:48:18.898
Come on with me.

522
00:48:19.041 --> 00:48:21.642
We're heading back to town,
to the nearest police station.


523
00:48:22.461 --> 00:48:25.114
Don't argue with me. Come on.

524
00:48:25.214 --> 00:48:27.033
Greg, I don't think we
should go with him.


525
00:48:27.133 --> 00:48:28.533
It's okay.

526
00:48:32.263 --> 00:48:34.956
Now you ain't got
a choice, young lady.


527
00:48:38.060 --> 00:48:39.627
Where's the shack?

528
00:48:39.729 --> 00:48:41.838
Like I said, it's back at the lake.

529
00:48:42.231 --> 00:48:44.008
Our two friends were
hanging on the wall,


530
00:48:44.108 --> 00:48:45.468
with three others, three men.

531
00:48:45.568 --> 00:48:47.218
You're going to take me there.

532
00:48:47.445 --> 00:48:50.306
You're crazy. I don't
want to go back there.


533
00:48:50.406 --> 00:48:51.599
Take it easy, Sandy.

534
00:48:51.699 --> 00:48:54.100
No, I don't want to go back there.
We need the police.


535
00:48:54.744 --> 00:48:56.896
Now before we can convince the police

536
00:48:56.996 --> 00:49:00.775
that we ain't as crazy as Sarge,
this thing is going to kill again.


537
00:49:00.875 --> 00:49:02.525
Now, get in the truck.

538
00:49:03.920 --> 00:49:07.030
He's right. Yeah, he's right.
Come on.


539
00:49:35.201 --> 00:49:37.321
Come on, let's get him
the hell out of here.


540
00:49:39.580 --> 00:49:40.982
He going to be all right?

541
00:49:41.082 --> 00:49:42.732
I don't know. We'll do our best.

542
00:49:47.338 --> 00:49:50.198
Better hope he ain't dead Sarge.

543
00:49:52.009 --> 00:49:58.414
No chance. No help. No escape.

544
00:50:02.311 --> 00:50:06.132
Dobbs! Fred! Sergeant First Class.

545
00:50:06.232 --> 00:50:09.717
Serial number RA18840644.

546
00:50:35.302 --> 00:50:36.953
You two stay here.

547
00:51:13.507 --> 00:51:16.367
Greg, please. I don't
want to go back there.


548
00:51:18.095 --> 00:51:21.289
We don't know who this guy is,
and we don't know what he's going to do.


549
00:51:22.516 --> 00:51:25.164
I saw something in front of that
bar I've never seen before,


550
00:51:25.265 --> 00:51:27.228
and I have no
desire to see it again.

551
00:51:27.438 --> 00:51:29.382
Sandy, Tom was my best friend.

552
00:51:29.482 --> 00:51:32.495
Yeah, well Beth was my best friend.
What does that got to do with it?


553
00:51:32.735 --> 00:51:34.637
It means I've got to do something.

554
00:51:34.737 --> 00:51:37.515
Like what? They're both dead.
We can't help them now.


555
00:51:37.615 --> 00:51:42.103
I don't know, by helping Taylor kill

556
00:51:42.203 --> 00:51:44.312
whatever it was that killed them.

557
00:51:45.790 --> 00:51:51.278
Don't give me that macho revenge,
John Wayne stuff, huh?


558
00:51:51.378 --> 00:51:52.778
Then stay.

559
00:51:54.090 --> 00:51:56.407
I'm sorry. I can't.

560
00:52:41.303 --> 00:52:42.703
Look.

561
00:52:44.390 --> 00:52:46.374
Once they almost got me.

562
00:52:47.226 --> 00:52:49.293
One of those creatures did that.

563
00:52:50.688 --> 00:52:52.131
Why didn't you tell someone?

564
00:52:52.231 --> 00:52:53.751
Why didn't you do something?

565
00:52:53.941 --> 00:52:56.634
Yeah, sure. You mean like Sarge?

566
00:52:57.153 --> 00:52:58.763
You saw the way
everybody believed him.


567
00:52:58.863 --> 00:53:00.471
No, I'm not.

568
00:53:00.614 --> 00:53:03.309
I ain't looking to get locked up.

569
00:53:03.409 --> 00:53:05.393
I'm looking to kill me the alien.

570
00:53:08.873 --> 00:53:10.856
If he don't kill me first.

571
00:53:13.210 --> 00:53:15.404
Hold it. Hold it right there.
That's where it is.


572
00:53:15.504 --> 00:53:17.573
Behind those trees.
That's where the shack is.


573
00:53:17.673 --> 00:53:19.073
You sure?

574
00:53:19.258 --> 00:53:20.658
I'm sure.

575
00:53:45.242 --> 00:53:46.767
Are you staying here?

576
00:54:40.547 --> 00:54:41.947
Right there.

577
00:54:48.097 --> 00:54:49.623
- Is that it?
- Yeah.


578
00:54:49.723 --> 00:54:52.683
Hey, be careful there's a hole out
there somewhere Sandy fell in.


579
00:54:53.435 --> 00:54:56.525
Sarge has been digging them all over
the woods trying to catch this thing.


580
00:54:57.856 --> 00:55:00.092
You two wait here, I'm going up.

581
00:55:00.192 --> 00:55:02.595
No, wait a minute. You can't
leave us without any protection.


582
00:55:02.695 --> 00:55:04.295
Why don't you give us the gun?

583
00:55:08.492 --> 00:55:13.729
Hey, I ain't the crazy one. Remember?

584
00:56:54.640 --> 00:56:56.332
It's just like you said.

585
00:56:57.101 --> 00:56:58.542
Can we go now?

586
00:56:59.937 --> 00:57:02.004
You don't know what you found here.

587
00:57:05.234 --> 00:57:07.718
This is where the
hunter keeps his food.


588
00:57:10.489 --> 00:57:12.266
What are you talking about?

589
00:57:12.366 --> 00:57:15.059
We got him right where we want him.

590
00:57:16.036 --> 00:57:18.230
Sooner or later he's got to come back

591
00:57:18.330 --> 00:57:22.609
for the bodies, and we'll be waiting.

592
00:57:22.709 --> 00:57:24.153
Like hell we will.

593
00:57:24.253 --> 00:57:25.612
We're not going to be waiting.

594
00:57:25.712 --> 00:57:27.072
We're not going to stay here.

595
00:57:27.172 --> 00:57:29.990
We're going to leave right now.

596
00:57:30.259 --> 00:57:33.577
I'd think about it if
I was you. It's a...


597
00:57:50.571 --> 00:57:54.058
Take the light and go.
Get out of here. Leave me!


598
00:57:54.158 --> 00:57:55.850
We've got to get out of here.

599
01:00:53.128 --> 01:00:54.695
Here comes somebody.

600
01:00:57.883 --> 01:00:59.658
Stop!

601
01:01:06.308 --> 01:01:07.459
Here comes another one.

602
01:01:07.559 --> 01:01:09.239
Don't worry, I'll stop this one.

603
01:01:20.238 --> 01:01:23.932
It's a cop. All right! Yeah. Yeah.

604
01:01:34.252 --> 01:01:35.944
Thank God you're the police.

605
01:01:36.338 --> 01:01:38.739
Something's chasing us,
some kind of creature.


606
01:01:40.050 --> 01:01:42.534
They're in the woods,
their bodies are in the shack.


607
01:01:43.929 --> 01:01:45.330
We can take you to the
shack and the bodies,


608
01:01:45.430 --> 01:01:46.623
but there's a man out there.

609
01:01:46.723 --> 01:01:48.500
He's still hurt. 
His name is Taylor.

610
01:01:48.600 --> 01:01:50.626
He's from around here.

611
01:01:51.853 --> 01:01:53.693
Hey look, we're headed the wrong way.

612
01:01:54.940 --> 01:01:57.257
Are we going to town.
What about Taylor?


613
01:02:03.490 --> 01:02:05.474
What about Taylor?

614
01:02:47.909 --> 01:02:50.769
We were just out there, with Taylor.

615
01:02:51.997 --> 01:02:53.273
He's been wounded by the alien.

616
01:02:53.373 --> 01:02:56.268
Now we've got to go back and get
him or he's not going to make it.


617
01:02:56.418 --> 01:02:59.111
You want me to go back
with you, is that right?


618
01:02:59.254 --> 01:03:03.367
Yes, please.
The man is dying out there.


619
01:03:03.467 --> 01:03:05.033
You've got to believe us.

620
01:03:05.761 --> 01:03:08.036
Believe a POW, are you kidding?

621
01:03:08.638 --> 01:03:10.289
I'm a Sergeant.

622
01:04:01.107 --> 01:04:04.343
What'd you do, kill the kids
and take over their bodies?


623
01:04:04.945 --> 01:04:06.345
What?

624
01:04:06.655 --> 01:04:08.513
He thinks that we're the aliens.

625
01:04:08.949 --> 01:04:12.851
Well, okay. Okay.
You don't have to tell me now.


626
01:04:13.620 --> 01:04:15.979
I'll find out soon enough.

627
01:05:14.639 --> 01:05:20.836
All right. Get out.
Over there. Come on.


628
01:05:25.692 --> 01:05:27.968
I'm sure even you
creatures feel pain.


629
01:05:32.657 --> 01:05:34.349
All right, talk.

630
01:05:36.077 --> 01:05:38.603
I've seen experts make people talk.

631
01:05:39.706 --> 01:05:42.899
Real experts, believe me.

632
01:05:43.001 --> 01:05:44.820
Please don't hurt us.

633
01:05:44.920 --> 01:05:46.320
Shut up!

634
01:05:47.380 --> 01:05:48.865
Go ahead talk.

635
01:05:48.965 --> 01:05:52.868
Sarge, put down the gun,
I'll tell you everything okay?


636
01:05:53.470 --> 01:05:55.412
I'm not putting down the gun.

637
01:05:56.306 --> 01:05:58.208
You tell me...

638
01:05:58.308 --> 01:06:01.376
tell me about the invasion force.

639
01:06:02.562 --> 01:06:04.548
Okay, okay.
I'll tell you, I'll tell you.


640
01:06:04.648 --> 01:06:06.174
Where should I start?

641
01:06:06.274 --> 01:06:07.467
At the beginning.

642
01:06:07.567 --> 01:06:09.760
Alright, I'll start at the beginning.

643
01:06:09.945 --> 01:06:17.519
Okay. Your world is divided
into seven regions.


644
01:06:17.619 --> 01:06:24.943
Each region is a part of the
colonization directive,


645
01:06:25.043 --> 01:06:29.863
and each region reaches to the
center of your planet. Your Earth.


646
01:06:30.924 --> 01:06:33.243
Shall I draw it for you?

647
01:06:33.343 --> 01:06:34.951
Yeah.

648
01:06:38.807 --> 01:06:43.585
Your earth, your world is
divided into seven regions.


649
01:06:45.313 --> 01:06:48.131
Your America.

650
01:06:49.985 --> 01:06:53.847
We anticipate the most resistance

651
01:06:53.947 --> 01:06:57.224
here and a few other places.

652
01:07:01.663 --> 01:07:03.897
When's all this going to begin?

653
01:07:05.333 --> 01:07:11.029
The main striking force begins now.

654
01:07:34.112 --> 01:07:36.596
Come on. Show yourself.

655
01:07:37.282 --> 01:07:39.266
No use trying to get away!

656
01:07:42.120 --> 01:07:43.396
I know you're down there.

657
01:07:43.496 --> 01:07:45.313
Just tell me what I want to know.

658
01:08:14.569 --> 01:08:16.845
- Which way?
- I don't know.


659
01:08:30.835 --> 01:08:32.235
Come on!

660
01:09:33.189 --> 01:09:34.631
Are you all right?

661
01:09:37.485 --> 01:09:38.887
What's the matter?

662
01:09:38.987 --> 01:09:40.595
I sprained my ankle.

663
01:09:40.697 --> 01:09:44.349
Come on, we've got to get
out of here. I'll help you. Easy.


664
01:09:52.876 --> 01:09:54.568
That's it. That's it.

665
01:09:56.212 --> 01:09:57.612
Okay.

666
01:09:59.257 --> 01:10:00.824
Look.

667
01:10:01.801 --> 01:10:03.201
Come on.

668
01:10:28.578 --> 01:10:29.729
You think anybody's home?

669
01:10:29.829 --> 01:10:31.980
I don't know,
but we're going to find out.


670
01:10:57.023 --> 01:10:58.508
Hello! Anybody home?

671
01:10:58.608 --> 01:11:00.218
Looks like somebody lives here.

672
01:11:00.318 --> 01:11:02.358
Well, we're not waiting
for an invitation.


673
01:11:22.423 --> 01:11:24.117
Oh, good, another light.

674
01:11:24.217 --> 01:11:26.409
Hello? Anybody home?

675
01:11:28.846 --> 01:11:30.498
Oh, we can use their phone.

676
01:11:30.598 --> 01:11:32.082
Yeah, if they've got one.

677
01:11:33.142 --> 01:11:36.961
This place looks like somebody's
vacation cabin, or something.


678
01:11:37.188 --> 01:11:39.047
We must have broke in the back door.

679
01:11:41.567 --> 01:11:43.720
Hello? Anybody home?

680
01:11:43.820 --> 01:11:45.345
Let's check this out.

681
01:11:46.406 --> 01:11:47.847
Hello?

682
01:11:49.325 --> 01:11:50.643
Hello?

683
01:11:50.743 --> 01:11:51.728
Greg?

684
01:11:51.828 --> 01:11:53.228
Yeah.

685
01:11:53.413 --> 01:11:55.230
Greg, you okay?

686
01:12:01.170 --> 01:12:02.612
I found the light.

687
01:12:03.423 --> 01:12:04.864
Look, a phone.

688
01:12:11.806 --> 01:12:12.874
It's dead.

689
01:12:12.974 --> 01:12:14.624
Well, what are we going to do?

690
01:12:15.101 --> 01:12:18.880
Well, no matter what, it's safer
to stay inside than it is outside.


691
01:12:18.980 --> 01:12:21.180
Come on let's check out
the rest of this place.


692
01:12:22.442 --> 01:12:23.967
There's another light.

693
01:12:25.069 --> 01:12:29.180
Great, dead phone,
no people, no nothing.


694
01:12:29.532 --> 01:12:30.683
Well, I am wet and freezing.

695
01:12:30.783 --> 01:12:33.601
- I'm going to check out this closet.
- Okay.


696
01:12:43.046 --> 01:12:47.325
- Oh, great. Dry clothes.
- Terrific.


697
01:12:47.425 --> 01:12:49.743
- I'm going to get dressed. Okay?
- Okay.


698
01:12:49.886 --> 01:12:54.165
You know, we can either
hang around here,


699
01:12:54.265 --> 01:12:59.170
or we can wait for somebody to show,
if there's anybody around.


700
01:12:59.270 --> 01:13:01.230
Or we can try and
make it back to town.


701
01:13:19.665 --> 01:13:22.192
- Okay, ready.
- Great.


702
01:13:31.177 --> 01:13:37.207
It's bone dry. Looks like nobody's
been around here for a while.


703
01:13:41.979 --> 01:13:44.422
I used to have
a music box like this.

704
01:13:52.490 --> 01:13:54.265
What's the matter?

705
01:13:55.284 --> 01:13:58.895
Beth, she gave it to me
on my ninth birthday.


706
01:14:04.168 --> 01:14:08.154
I'll never forget it because
she was so excited about it.


707
01:14:14.554 --> 01:14:16.579
She bought it six months before.

708
01:14:20.810 --> 01:14:23.254
It's okay. It's okay.

709
01:14:23.354 --> 01:14:27.924
It's okay. Go ahead.
Go ahead. It's okay.


710
01:14:28.526 --> 01:14:30.845
Come on. Look, look.
Why don't you go down...


711
01:14:30.945 --> 01:14:33.805
We'll go over here and you can
rest for a while, come on.


712
01:14:42.457 --> 01:14:43.857
All right.

713
01:14:45.501 --> 01:14:46.569
Don't worry about a thing.

714
01:14:46.669 --> 01:14:48.789
We won't leave until
first light, all right?


715
01:14:48.963 --> 01:14:51.739
I'll put your clothes by the heater,
they'll be nice and warm.


716
01:14:51.841 --> 01:14:54.033
Try and get some rest, all right?

717
01:14:54.135 --> 01:14:56.619
- Okay.
- Okay.


718
01:14:56.888 --> 01:14:59.165
Greg, I just thought of something.

719
01:14:59.265 --> 01:15:01.709
What if this place belongs to Sarge?
We've got to get out of here.


720
01:15:01.809 --> 01:15:04.337
No, no, no. Now just
lie back. It's okay.


721
01:15:04.437 --> 01:15:08.257
We're safer inside here than we
would be outside. No matter what.


722
01:15:08.357 --> 01:15:10.676
Now don't worry about anything.
Have a little faith in me will you?


723
01:15:10.776 --> 01:15:12.176
I'll stand guard.

724
01:15:12.278 --> 01:15:14.389
- Okay?
- Okay.


725
01:15:14.489 --> 01:15:18.539
Okay, now you try and get some rest.
I'll put your clothes by the heater.


726
01:16:03.704 --> 01:16:06.147
Ten or twelve cups of you should do.

727
01:16:15.758 --> 01:16:17.283
Greg!

728
01:16:26.143 --> 01:16:29.088
- I saw that horrible creature.
- Come on.


729
01:16:29.188 --> 01:16:32.215
It was chasing me. 
I couldn't run.

730
01:16:37.280 --> 01:16:39.764
I couldn't see it,
and it could see me.


731
01:16:39.949 --> 01:16:42.475
I was trapped in this room.

732
01:16:42.660 --> 01:16:45.396
It's okay. It's okay.
It's just a dream.


733
01:16:45.496 --> 01:16:46.981
- It's okay.
- I'm sorry.


734
01:16:47.081 --> 01:16:48.815
Don't be sorry. It's okay.

735
01:16:51.752 --> 01:16:53.361
The door's open.

736
01:16:55.256 --> 01:16:56.781
That was no dream.

737
01:16:57.842 --> 01:17:00.743
- Maybe the cat got back in.
- Yeah, maybe.


738
01:17:02.513 --> 01:17:04.633
What if it's the people
that own this place?


739
01:17:05.349 --> 01:17:06.250
That'd be just great.

740
01:17:06.350 --> 01:17:07.752
I can see us making it
through this whole mess


741
01:17:07.852 --> 01:17:09.919
and then getting shot as a burglar.

742
01:17:15.276 --> 01:17:18.511
Look, I'm going to go
check it out. You stay here.


743
01:17:19.405 --> 01:17:22.015
Oh, no, you're not going
to leave me here alone.


744
01:17:22.908 --> 01:17:24.560
Don't argue with me.

745
01:17:24.660 --> 01:17:26.936
Okay, okay. You lead.

746
01:17:29.999 --> 01:17:32.984
- No.
- Yeah, that's what I thought. Come on.


747
01:17:34.920 --> 01:17:37.113
Is anybody there?
We're friends. Hello?


748
01:17:39.508 --> 01:17:40.992
Hello?

749
01:18:04.492 --> 01:18:07.226
- Don't do that.
- Sorry.


750
01:18:07.370 --> 01:18:08.895
It's okay.

751
01:18:13.793 --> 01:18:15.593
I think it must have been the wind.

752
01:18:30.976 --> 01:18:33.127
- What's the matter?
- I don't know.


753
01:18:35.231 --> 01:18:37.673
I thought I turned this water off.

754
01:18:38.317 --> 01:18:40.011
I don't understand.

755
01:18:40.111 --> 01:18:42.053
Yeah, yeah, neither do I.

756
01:18:44.615 --> 01:18:46.455
I think we better look around again.

757
01:19:19.066 --> 01:19:21.134
Didn't I turn that light out?

758
01:19:22.153 --> 01:19:24.178
I don't know. I guess so.

759
01:19:47.553 --> 01:19:49.370
Are we getting paranoid or what?

760
01:19:50.347 --> 01:19:52.039
Come on, you get back to bed.

761
01:20:06.238 --> 01:20:09.600
Now look, I've got a
pot of coffee going.


762
01:20:09.700 --> 01:20:12.059
I'm going to drink it,
I'm going to stay awake.


763
01:20:12.536 --> 01:20:14.979
Don't worry. I'm going
to get you out of this.


764
01:20:29.762 --> 01:20:33.331
Yeah, that's nice, I like that.
Put your braids down, that'd be nice.


765
01:21:05.506 --> 01:21:06.906
Greg!

766
01:21:26.402 --> 01:21:27.802
Greg?

767
01:21:31.198 --> 01:21:32.640
Are you asleep?

768
01:23:29.483 --> 01:23:30.883
Let's get out of here.

769
01:23:37.700 --> 01:23:39.100
Come on, let's go.

770
01:23:39.576 --> 01:23:41.353
We can't leave Greg back there.

771
01:23:41.453 --> 01:23:43.480
Greg's dead honey,
we can't do anything for him.


772
01:23:43.580 --> 01:23:45.608
- We're going to the shack.
- I don't want to go back there.


773
01:23:45.708 --> 01:23:47.860
All right you stay here.
That thing will be right along.


774
01:23:47.960 --> 01:23:49.402
We're talking about him.

775
01:23:49.878 --> 01:23:51.838
Why do we have to
go back to the shack?


776
01:23:53.340 --> 01:23:56.076
Please tell me. Why do we
have to go back to the shack?


777
01:23:56.176 --> 01:23:57.494
Because we're being hunted.

778
01:23:57.594 --> 01:23:59.413
That thing is going to follow
us no matter where we go.


779
01:23:59.513 --> 01:24:02.750
Right now the only choice we have
is where we're going to fight.


780
01:24:02.850 --> 01:24:06.001
And if we stand here talking,
we're going to lose that choice, too.


781
01:24:06.770 --> 01:24:08.714
You don't understand. 
You don't see.

782
01:24:08.814 --> 01:24:11.550
That thing ain't fighting
for survival. No siree.


783
01:24:11.650 --> 01:24:15.054
This ain't like the Sarge said,
that this is an invasion. No.


784
01:24:15.154 --> 01:24:17.640
That alien, he came down
here for the sport.


785
01:24:17.740 --> 01:24:20.100
He wants to get himself a few
trophies, and you know what?


786
01:24:20.200 --> 01:24:24.103
Right now, you and me,
we are the prize game.


787
01:24:25.664 --> 01:24:27.565
This is crazy.

788
01:24:29.626 --> 01:24:31.362
Yeah, I know it's crazy,

789
01:24:31.462 --> 01:24:34.363
- but I got the advantage on him.
- Huh?


790
01:24:34.673 --> 01:24:36.240
What? What advantage?

791
01:24:36.884 --> 01:24:41.996
I'm hunting him and he don't know it.

792
01:24:43.098 --> 01:24:44.665
Come on.

793
01:24:45.684 --> 01:24:48.127
Come on let's go! Come on!

794
01:25:17.132 --> 01:25:19.201
When the alien took off after you,

795
01:25:19.301 --> 01:25:22.068
I doubled back here and rigged
this shack with enough dynamite


796
01:25:22.169 --> 01:25:25.289
to blow him halfway back
to wherever he came from.


797
01:25:26.600 --> 01:25:31.754
Use the scope. It's by
the door, on the right side.


798
01:25:34.191 --> 01:25:38.385
- Did you see it?
- Yeah, yeah.


799
01:25:38.695 --> 01:25:40.513
Look, let me have the gun.

800
01:25:41.448 --> 01:25:44.368
What makes you so sure that
the alien's going to come back here?


801
01:25:44.618 --> 01:25:47.229
Because a hunter always
comes back for his game.


802
01:25:47.329 --> 01:25:49.189
He's got his catch stored in there.

803
01:25:49.289 --> 01:25:52.483
All I've got to do
is hit this plunger.


804
01:25:53.252 --> 01:25:54.652
Yeah.

805
01:25:54.753 --> 01:25:57.988
And boom. Goodbye alien.

806
01:25:59.466 --> 01:26:02.870
Don't be afraid. It's going
to work all right. Yeah.


807
01:26:02.970 --> 01:26:04.580
- Get you to a doctor?
- Yeah.


808
01:26:04.680 --> 01:26:06.539
Aliens don't need doctors.

809
01:26:07.224 --> 01:26:08.624
Over there.

810
01:26:13.522 --> 01:26:15.966
Come on now, take it easy Sarge.

811
01:26:16.066 --> 01:26:17.968
This is me, Joe Taylor.
Heck, you know me.


812
01:26:18.068 --> 01:26:19.261
We've been hunting together.

813
01:26:19.361 --> 01:26:22.846
You can't fool me.
You're not Joe Taylor.


814
01:26:23.699 --> 01:26:25.933
The Joe Taylor I know was a man.

815
01:26:26.660 --> 01:26:28.394
You took over his body.

816
01:26:29.496 --> 01:26:32.566
I hate to think what you
aliens did to the real Joe Taylor.


817
01:26:32.666 --> 01:26:36.570
What? This is crazy, man.
You know this guy.


818
01:26:36.670 --> 01:26:38.529
We're human, just like you.

819
01:26:40.090 --> 01:26:43.867
I did know him,
and he was a good friend.


820
01:26:46.471 --> 01:26:49.540
I lost a lot of friends
in this jungle.


821
01:26:50.601 --> 01:26:52.961
Oh, now listen Sarge,
this ain't no jungle.


822
01:26:53.061 --> 01:26:55.754
This is the United States.
You're home.


823
01:26:56.148 --> 01:26:57.965
You've come back home Sarge.

824
01:26:58.150 --> 01:27:00.884
You're not going to convince
me you're Joe Taylor.


825
01:27:03.322 --> 01:27:04.805
No chance.

826
01:27:06.575 --> 01:27:08.225
No help.

827
01:27:11.079 --> 01:27:12.479
No escape.

828
01:27:50.786 --> 01:27:54.438
I knew I'd get one
of you. I knew it.

829
01:28:02.005 --> 01:28:03.656
You one of the leaders?

830
01:28:04.800 --> 01:28:06.742
Or just a soldier huh?

831
01:28:09.638 --> 01:28:13.207
I got you. I got you. Yeah.

832
01:28:17.771 --> 01:28:20.923
I knew I'd get you. I got you.

833
01:28:21.900 --> 01:28:23.592
It's going to be all right.

834
01:28:38.500 --> 01:28:40.275
They all laughed at me.

835
01:28:41.169 --> 01:28:45.407
They said I was crazy,
but now they're going to know.


836
01:28:45.507 --> 01:28:47.324
Yes, they're going to know.

837
01:28:51.596 --> 01:28:55.274
Keep going. A little closer
to the shack. Keep going.


838
01:28:55.375 --> 01:28:58.335
- You're going to kill both of them.
- If I have to, yeah.


839
01:28:58.437 --> 01:29:02.475
I was very worried when you
made me do that to the sheriff,


840
01:29:03.876 --> 01:29:08.721
but now it's going to be all right.
Yeah, they're going to thank me.


841
01:29:11.533 --> 01:29:15.436
I knew what was going
on around here. I knew.


842
01:29:59.039 --> 01:30:01.079
The alien's not close
enough to the shack.


843
01:30:02.959 --> 01:30:04.401
Shoot him.

844
01:30:05.545 --> 01:30:08.105
- That's not going to do any good.
- You've got to try.


845
01:30:31.488 --> 01:30:33.263
I hit him.

846
01:31:26.334 --> 01:31:27.734
Pull it.

847
01:31:28.628 --> 01:31:30.821
Let me get it.

848
01:31:44.186 --> 01:31:45.836
It's up to you now.

849
01:31:46.104 --> 01:31:49.631
When I get that alien to the shack,
you push the plunger.


850
01:31:53.236 --> 01:31:59.391
Alien! Alien!

851
01:32:00.702 --> 01:32:05.188
Alien! Come on!

852
01:32:12.297 --> 01:32:15.200
Hit the plunger.
Come on, push it, Sandy.


853
01:32:15.300 --> 01:32:17.159
You've got to push the plunger.

854
01:32:25.227 --> 01:32:26.835
The wires.

855
01:32:28.688 --> 01:32:30.213
Sandy.

856
01:33:26.705 --> 01:33:29.606
You think we're the only living
creatures in this universe?


857
01:33:29.874 --> 01:33:33.069
Do you think with all those stars out
there we're the only things that exist?


858
01:33:33.169 --> 01:33:34.820
Well, I've got news for you.

859
01:33:35.714 --> 01:33:38.782
We ain't. We ain't alone.
