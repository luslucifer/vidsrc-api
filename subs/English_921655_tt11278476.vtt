1
00:01:14.612 --> 00:01:15.697
Ruby!

2
00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:33.506
Hot dog!

3
00:01:34.757 --> 00:01:35.925
Ruby, come get it.

4
00:01:36.718 --> 00:01:37.927
Hot dog!

5
00:01:44.517 --> 00:01:48.313
Oh! Good girl! Good girl.

6
00:01:48.396 --> 00:01:50.523
Good girl. Oh, Ruby!

7
00:01:50.607 --> 00:01:51.691
Oh!

8
00:01:51.774 --> 00:01:54.027
And you have a date with a family.

9
00:01:54.527 --> 00:01:55.570
Oh!

10
00:01:55.653 --> 00:01:57.947
Somewhere in you is an adoptable dog.

11
00:01:58.031 --> 00:02:00.033
I know. I know.

12
00:02:00.116 --> 00:02:02.160
All right. Good girl. Come on.

13
00:02:22.055 --> 00:02:24.891
Oh my gosh! We've got skunk soap.

14
00:02:24.974 --> 00:02:27.435
Perfect. Thank you. Come on, Ruby.

15
00:02:27.518 --> 00:02:30.855
- She knows a family's picking her up.
- She doesn't want to leave us.


16
00:02:30.939 --> 00:02:32.619
No, no, no, she
doesn't want to leave you.

17
00:02:33.149 --> 00:02:35.360
Well, I'd take her home,
but my husband would leave me.


18
00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:38.279
All right, come on.

19
00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:42.992
This is serious now.

20
00:02:43.076 --> 00:02:45.536
You've been here six months. Yeah.

21
00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:47.330
You cannot blow this chance.

22
00:02:47.413 --> 00:02:49.499
<i>You've been to seven homes already.</i>

23
00:02:49.582 --> 00:02:50.917
Darn dog!

24
00:02:53.336 --> 00:02:54.545
Ruby!

25
00:02:56.297 --> 00:02:57.966
Get out of there, Ruby!

26
00:02:58.049 --> 00:02:59.425
Ruby!

27
00:03:01.678 --> 00:03:04.347
It's time to clean up your act, sweetie.

28
00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:06.766
All right? Come on, stinky.
Let's get you going.


29
00:03:11.396 --> 00:03:12.397
Ah!

30
00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:19.112
Come on!

31
00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:25.994
Let's hope this placement sticks.

32
00:03:26.077 --> 00:03:27.578
All right.

33
00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:20.214
- Oh, I washed that.
- I just picked a piece of onion off it.


34
00:04:20.298 --> 00:04:21.299
Oh.

35
00:04:21.924 --> 00:04:22.925
Yum, yum, yum.

36
00:04:23.009 --> 00:04:26.137
Come sit with us. I don't even let
my third graders eat while standing.


37
00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:28.240
I failed third grade. And fourth.

38
00:04:28.264 --> 00:04:31.100
- You're exaggerating.
- Oh, you'd have failed me.


39
00:04:31.184 --> 00:04:34.562
Never. You would be my favorite.
Teacher's pet.


40
00:04:36.064 --> 00:04:37.064
Bye.

41
00:04:42.445 --> 00:04:43.571
Careful today.

42
00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:46.990
Always.

43
00:04:49.285 --> 00:04:51.412
- Say "Bye, Dada."
- Bye-bye, Dada.


44
00:04:57.335 --> 00:04:59.295
That boat's
in a good spot there.


45
00:04:59.962 --> 00:05:01.964
All right now. That's clear.

46
00:05:04.842 --> 00:05:07.178
- Head down current there.
- Let's go. Seek!


47
00:05:07.261 --> 00:05:08.261
Morning.

48
00:05:09.055 --> 00:05:10.055
Morning.

49
00:05:10.932 --> 00:05:12.725
- It's the K9 unit.
- Yeah.


50
00:05:12.809 --> 00:05:15.103
Searching for drugs
tossed out of a vehicle last night.


51
00:05:15.186 --> 00:05:17.706
That's some of Matt Zarella's team
down there. Best of the best.


52
00:05:17.772 --> 00:05:19.649
Like a Navy SEAL Special Ops team.

53
00:05:19.732 --> 00:05:22.360
300 million olfactory receptors
in their noses,


54
00:05:22.443 --> 00:05:23.945
compared to six million in people.

55
00:05:24.028 --> 00:05:26.614
Their sense of smell's

56
00:05:26.697 --> 00:05:28.866
If we can sense a teaspoon of sugar
in a cup of coffee,


57
00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:30.535
a dog can detect a teaspoon of sugar...

58
00:05:30.618 --> 00:05:32.912
In two Olympic-size pools
filled with water.


59
00:05:34.956 --> 00:05:35.998
Yeah.

60
00:05:36.082 --> 00:05:39.502
Uh, Daniel O'Neil. Rhode Island
state trooper, Wickford Barracks.


61
00:05:39.585 --> 00:05:42.797
Seamus Brady.
Retired maintenance, Scituate Barracks.


62
00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:44.674
- Well, it's good to meet you.
- Mm.


63
00:05:46.509 --> 00:05:47.593
Look. Found.

64
00:05:47.677 --> 00:05:48.970
Bring it in.

65
00:05:49.053 --> 00:05:51.055
Smooth. Good job!

66
00:05:51.139 --> 00:05:51.973
Excellent work.

67
00:05:52.056 --> 00:05:54.392
I'm gonna be one of those guys
with one of those dogs.


68
00:05:56.394 --> 00:05:58.479
I gotta, uh... 
Good to meet you, Mr. Brady.

69
00:05:59.147 --> 00:06:00.940
Bring it in. Let's go, team.

70
00:06:06.279 --> 00:06:08.865
Weather continues to be unseasonably warm.

71
00:06:08.948 --> 00:06:11.742
Not even May, but keep an eye out
for stranded motorists,


72
00:06:11.826 --> 00:06:14.370
carry extra water
for overheating radiators.


73
00:06:14.454 --> 00:06:17.081
No matter the heat, hats stay on.

74
00:06:17.165 --> 00:06:19.375
I'm talking to you, Two Towers.

75
00:06:19.459 --> 00:06:21.210
- You got it, Sarge.
- You got it, Sarge.


76
00:06:23.004 --> 00:06:25.298
And of special interest to O'Neil.

77
00:06:25.381 --> 00:06:26.799
It's that time of year.

78
00:06:26.883 --> 00:06:30.052
Tryouts for the K9 academy
are coming up May 15.


79
00:06:30.136 --> 00:06:31.387
Right on, my brother.

80
00:06:31.471 --> 00:06:33.848
Eighth time trying to get in
is gonna be the charm.


81
00:06:36.309 --> 00:06:37.435
Be safe, everyone.

82
00:06:44.525 --> 00:06:47.695
Sarge. Uh, this year's my last chance.

83
00:06:47.778 --> 00:06:51.407
The applicants have to be under 30,
and I'm 29.


84
00:06:51.491 --> 00:06:53.242
I'll write the letter of rec again,

85
00:06:53.326 --> 00:06:56.204
but I'm not the one
standing in the way of you trying out.


86
00:06:56.829 --> 00:07:00.249
It's Zarella. His K9 unit, his academy.

87
00:07:03.211 --> 00:07:04.795
Come on.

88
00:07:04.879 --> 00:07:06.881
Come on. She'll come.

89
00:07:06.964 --> 00:07:08.007
Come on, Ruby.

90
00:07:09.342 --> 00:07:11.594
Okay, go on. Go. 
Go on, sweetie.

91
00:07:11.677 --> 00:07:13.095
Go on. Go.

92
00:07:13.804 --> 00:07:15.890
There you go.
That's nice, right? There you go.


93
00:07:16.682 --> 00:07:18.684
- Oh.
- Aw. She got away.


94
00:07:18.768 --> 00:07:21.312
Oh! Okay, okay, okay. Okay!

95
00:07:21.395 --> 00:07:23.064
Go on. Go on.

96
00:07:23.147 --> 00:07:24.482
Go!

97
00:07:24.565 --> 00:07:25.608
Go on.

98
00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:27.400
Good.

99
00:07:27.443 --> 00:07:29.862
Ah, there you go.

100
00:07:31.948 --> 00:07:33.241
Come.

101
00:07:33.324 --> 00:07:35.952
There you go.
That's nice, right? There you go.


102
00:07:36.702 --> 00:07:38.621
I don't wanna see her back here.

103
00:07:40.957 --> 00:07:42.250
I'll have no choice.

104
00:08:14.115 --> 00:08:15.115
Thanks.

105
00:08:35.636 --> 00:08:39.765
Excuse me, sir. How many juice boxes
have you had this afternoon?


106
00:08:41.475 --> 00:08:43.894
All right.
License and registration, please.


107
00:08:44.562 --> 00:08:45.813
Mom!

108
00:08:45.896 --> 00:08:47.565
Hey, I was... I was just kidding.

109
00:08:50.568 --> 00:08:53.529
Sir, I know you think
I don't have the right stuff to...


110
00:08:53.613 --> 00:08:54.905
No. The right temperament.

111
00:08:54.989 --> 00:08:57.700
No, no, no, no. Don't presume
to know what he knows or thinks.


112
00:08:57.783 --> 00:08:59.076
Daniel O'Neil.

113
00:09:00.786 --> 00:09:02.121
Like clockwork.

114
00:09:02.913 --> 00:09:03.913
Sir.

115
00:09:10.963 --> 00:09:12.840
All right, sit down.

116
00:09:12.923 --> 00:09:15.426
Sir, I know you think
I don't have the right temperament,


117
00:09:15.509 --> 00:09:18.012
that I'm easily distracted,
maybe not much of a reader,


118
00:09:18.095 --> 00:09:21.474
but for the job I think intuitive skills
and people skills are more important


119
00:09:21.557 --> 00:09:23.225
than being speedy with paperwork.

120
00:09:23.309 --> 00:09:24.644
Plus, I love dogs.

121
00:09:25.478 --> 00:09:26.854
I'm ready for this.

122
00:09:26.937 --> 00:09:29.231
I'd really like to try out, sir.

123
00:09:31.233 --> 00:09:34.320
Aren't you qualified
in a bunch of other trooper specialties?


124
00:09:34.403 --> 00:09:37.615
Yes, sir. I am.
Hostage negotiating, EVOC training,


125
00:09:37.698 --> 00:09:40.326
peer-to-peer counseling,
honor guard, boat team, dive team.


126
00:09:40.409 --> 00:09:44.413
But K9 is my dream. You know that, sir.
I mean, I think you know that, sir.


127
00:09:44.497 --> 00:09:47.500
Sorry, sir. I don't mean to presume
to know what you know or think.


128
00:09:49.919 --> 00:09:51.879
- I'm a fan.
- Thanks.


129
00:09:52.421 --> 00:09:54.048
But also a truth-teller.

130
00:09:55.591 --> 00:09:58.302
K9 team requires calm

131
00:09:59.053 --> 00:10:00.221
and focus.

132
00:10:01.097 --> 00:10:03.891
You're all over the place.
You can't even sit still.


133
00:10:05.768 --> 00:10:08.896
- Who knows where your mind is.
- It's here, sir.


134
00:10:15.611 --> 00:10:17.154
I appreciate the candor

135
00:10:17.238 --> 00:10:20.449
and the persistence, but I don't see it.

136
00:10:21.784 --> 00:10:25.371
You do this
because you care about people, sir.


137
00:10:26.747 --> 00:10:27.748
The same as me.

138
00:10:28.708 --> 00:10:32.044
You want justice.
You want endings to stories.


139
00:10:32.128 --> 00:10:34.755
Sometimes happy endings.

140
00:10:35.715 --> 00:10:37.091
Sometimes just closure.

141
00:10:37.174 --> 00:10:39.802
The department has no money for new dogs.

142
00:10:41.846 --> 00:10:46.183
The German shepherds we use
come from Czech Republic or Germany


143
00:10:46.267 --> 00:10:48.227
and cost over $10,000 each.

144
00:10:52.314 --> 00:10:56.444
I know how much you want this.
How long you've waited.


145
00:11:01.574 --> 00:11:05.327
I'm a short guy.
I barely made the height requirement.


146
00:11:06.579 --> 00:11:11.500
I had to work twice as hard
to get to the same place as everyone else.


147
00:11:12.793 --> 00:11:14.754
I'm used to working ten times harder.

148
00:11:17.423 --> 00:11:18.549
Sir.

149
00:11:22.511 --> 00:11:23.554
Danny.

150
00:11:24.930 --> 00:11:25.930
Catch.

151
00:11:27.475 --> 00:11:29.101
<i>We don't have $10,000.</i>

152
00:11:29.185 --> 00:11:31.729
<i>With one kid here
and another on the way,</i>

153
00:11:31.812 --> 00:11:33.397
<i>we have our hands full.</i>

154
00:11:34.064 --> 00:11:37.026
- Say what you just said again.
- I'm pregnant.


155
00:11:37.610 --> 00:11:39.111
<i>That's great news!</i>

156
00:11:39.195 --> 00:11:40.738
<i>That's great!</i>

157
00:11:40.821 --> 00:11:42.239
Oh, Mel! Oh.

158
00:11:43.532 --> 00:11:44.533
Ma?

159
00:11:44.617 --> 00:11:47.495
K9 dogs live with their officer partners

160
00:11:47.578 --> 00:11:50.998
It's no trouble at all. They're trained.
You wouldn't have to lift a finger.


161
00:11:51.540 --> 00:11:54.502
I'm thinking now maybe
it's not the right time for the K9 thing.


162
00:11:55.169 --> 00:11:57.689
<i>Remember how we were building the deck
when I was carrying Finn,</i>


163
00:11:57.713 --> 00:12:00.382
<i>and you promised a quiet pregnancy
if it happened again?</i>


164
00:12:00.466 --> 00:12:03.636
It's... It's not the
right time for K9 unit.

165
00:12:03.719 --> 00:12:05.721
It's the <i>only</i> time, Mel.

166
00:12:05.805 --> 00:12:08.265
It's a... It's a step up, a raise.

167
00:12:08.349 --> 00:12:10.476
We'll finally be able
to pay off college loans,


168
00:12:10.559 --> 00:12:13.103
save for our kids,
maybe get a bigger house someday.


169
00:12:14.271 --> 00:12:17.066
- So what's the plan?
- I'll get back to you.


170
00:12:17.149 --> 00:12:19.026
<i>- All right. Love you.</i>
- I love you too.


171
00:12:24.740 --> 00:12:26.700
Hey. Down. Down.

172
00:12:26.784 --> 00:12:29.036
She doesn't listen. 
She's too high-strung.

173
00:12:29.119 --> 00:12:31.664
She chews. She digs. 
She steals food.

174
00:12:31.747 --> 00:12:35.709
She never sleeps. She barked all night.
She's not even housebroken.


175
00:12:35.793 --> 00:12:38.170
I know people who train dogs.
I could get you some names.


176
00:12:38.254 --> 00:12:40.631
- I'll pay for it.
- We're not keeping her.


177
00:12:41.215 --> 00:12:42.800
Maybe you have a kitten?

178
00:12:46.470 --> 00:12:49.849
That dog looks like Ruby, right?
But it's not. It's a new dog.


179
00:12:49.932 --> 00:12:53.727
She's had so many chances.
We can't keep unadoptable dogs.


180
00:12:54.687 --> 00:12:57.022
- She'll be put down tonight.
- Rick, no.


181
00:12:57.731 --> 00:13:01.610
Ruby's never had a real home.
She thinks this is home. We are her home.


182
00:13:01.694 --> 00:13:03.894
When somebody takes her,
she thinks she's just visiting,


183
00:13:03.946 --> 00:13:06.156
like going to the vet
and we're gonna pick her up.


184
00:13:08.200 --> 00:13:09.535
You know how these dogs are.

185
00:13:09.618 --> 00:13:12.663
Their family drops them off here,
and day after day they just wait,


186
00:13:12.746 --> 00:13:14.832
expecting their person
to come and get them.


187
00:13:14.915 --> 00:13:17.376
They'll wait and wait.
Sometimes they wait a very long time.


188
00:13:17.459 --> 00:13:20.880
It's heartbreaking.
Ruby just knows how to get back home.


189
00:13:22.172 --> 00:13:25.551
It can take a while before someone
as loyal and loving as a dog


190
00:13:25.634 --> 00:13:29.054
can commit to someone new.
Nobody's given Ruby that chance.


191
00:13:29.138 --> 00:13:31.307
- Pat, come on.
- One more day.


192
00:13:31.390 --> 00:13:33.976
I've got people I can call. Please.

193
00:13:36.478 --> 00:13:38.230
You have until the end of the day.

194
00:13:38.814 --> 00:13:40.524
But the vet comes at seven.

195
00:13:41.650 --> 00:13:45.195
<i>No, I wish we could
help you. We can't take any more dogs.</i>


196
00:13:45.279 --> 00:13:47.865
Thank you.
I just thought I'd give you another try.


197
00:13:47.948 --> 00:13:49.033
<i>Sorry.</i>

198
00:13:54.872 --> 00:13:55.872
Hi, honey.

199
00:13:55.915 --> 00:13:59.668
Whoa. Can you just
take Moonlight, please? Thank you.


200
00:13:59.752 --> 00:14:01.128
You can't do this to me. No.

201
00:14:01.211 --> 00:14:04.214
No. We got four kids.
And a rescue for each one.


202
00:14:04.798 --> 00:14:07.635
Plus George, and Billie,

203
00:14:07.718 --> 00:14:09.470
and Barney, and Moonlight.

204
00:14:10.429 --> 00:14:12.306
<i>- You're killing me.</i>
- Okay.


205
00:14:16.560 --> 00:14:19.188
All right, here we go.
All teams, these three.


206
00:14:19.813 --> 00:14:20.981
- Up!
- Good.


207
00:14:25.778 --> 00:14:26.946
Hey.

208
00:14:27.029 --> 00:14:29.698
Hey. Pull up a stool.

209
00:14:31.033 --> 00:14:32.952
What? All right.

210
00:14:35.037 --> 00:14:37.873
Lot better than sitting home watching TV.

211
00:14:38.707 --> 00:14:40.626
- A beer?
- Root beer.


212
00:14:42.002 --> 00:14:44.964
Finest sarsaparilla
with notes of ginger and clove.


213
00:14:46.423 --> 00:14:47.423
Yeah.

214
00:14:48.300 --> 00:14:51.387
Uh, you wouldn't know anyone with
a German shepherd to give away, would you?


215
00:14:52.137 --> 00:14:54.098
Nope.

216
00:14:55.432 --> 00:14:57.977
I, uh, I need one
to try out for the K9 unit.


217
00:14:59.561 --> 00:15:02.064
Don't tell Zarella you heard this from me,

218
00:15:02.690 --> 00:15:05.943
but you don't need a German shepherd.
Not technically.


219
00:15:06.860 --> 00:15:08.779
I've seen it before, up in Mass.

220
00:15:08.862 --> 00:15:12.241
See, what you're needing
is a young, good-sized dog


221
00:15:12.324 --> 00:15:14.368
who's curious,

222
00:15:14.451 --> 00:15:16.578
and agile, and has spirit.

223
00:15:19.540 --> 00:15:21.000
And costs nothing.

224
00:15:22.751 --> 00:15:23.836
Shoot.

225
00:15:31.677 --> 00:15:33.429
Hi. Um...

226
00:15:34.096 --> 00:15:35.973
I'm looking for a German shepherd.

227
00:15:36.056 --> 00:15:38.517
You lost one, or
are you hoping to adopt?

228
00:15:38.600 --> 00:15:41.145
Um, adopt. Adopt. Sorry.

229
00:15:42.813 --> 00:15:44.064
Contact info here.

230
00:15:45.941 --> 00:15:46.941
Oh.

231
00:15:48.360 --> 00:15:49.611
Um, okay.

232
00:15:52.114 --> 00:15:53.114
Uh...

233
00:15:53.782 --> 00:15:55.868
We don't get many purebreds.

234
00:15:55.951 --> 00:15:57.453
Could be a year or more.

235
00:15:59.204 --> 00:16:00.204
Um...

236
00:16:00.664 --> 00:16:02.624
All right. Know what?
Thank you. I'm sorry, but...


237
00:16:02.666 --> 00:16:04.334
We got a lot of great dogs.

238
00:16:04.418 --> 00:16:07.796
I mean, let me take you out back.
Take a look. You never know.


239
00:16:08.756 --> 00:16:10.340
Yeah, all right. Thank you.

240
00:16:24.063 --> 00:16:25.230
No name tag?

241
00:16:25.814 --> 00:16:28.025
Oh, yeah. That's so weird.

242
00:16:33.906 --> 00:16:36.200
- This one just gets to me.
- How old?


243
00:16:36.283 --> 00:16:37.993
A little more than a year.

244
00:16:41.830 --> 00:16:43.540
- Smart?
- Half Border collie.


245
00:16:43.624 --> 00:16:47.419
There's one named Chaser on YouTube
that knows the names of 1,000 objects.


246
00:16:47.920 --> 00:16:51.590
- You think he could be a K9 dog?
- She could be anything.


247
00:16:54.218 --> 00:16:55.886
I know, I know.

248
00:16:55.969 --> 00:16:57.513
Come here. Fetch it. Fetch it.

249
00:17:01.642 --> 00:17:03.352
Ruby, right here. Fetch it.

250
00:17:06.480 --> 00:17:07.481
Bring it to me.

251
00:17:17.866 --> 00:17:19.326
Ruby. Ruby. Ruby.

252
00:17:19.409 --> 00:17:20.744
Come here! Come here! Come here!

253
00:17:20.828 --> 00:17:23.205
Bring it to me.
Bring it here. Bring it here.


254
00:17:25.916 --> 00:17:28.210
Good girl. Come here. 
Bring it to me.

255
00:17:28.293 --> 00:17:31.088
Good girl. All right, ready?

256
00:17:31.588 --> 00:17:34.508
Ruby. Ready? Good girl. I know. I know.

257
00:17:34.591 --> 00:17:36.468
You ready? Come on, come on, come on.

258
00:17:36.552 --> 00:17:37.761
Come on.

259
00:17:37.845 --> 00:17:40.139
Oh, Ruby. Ruby. Ruby!

260
00:17:42.307 --> 00:17:44.643
Come here.
Come here, Ruby. Bring it to me.


261
00:17:44.726 --> 00:17:46.854
Here. Here. Good girl.

262
00:17:47.646 --> 00:17:49.565
Thank you. Thank you.

263
00:17:52.860 --> 00:17:54.111
Good girl. Thank you.

264
00:17:54.862 --> 00:17:55.904
She's special.

265
00:17:58.532 --> 00:18:01.410
So, are there forms to fill out?
Or... how does this work?


266
00:18:04.288 --> 00:18:06.665
So she's fixed.
She's had her shots.


267
00:18:06.748 --> 00:18:09.185
Anything else you'd like
to ask about her? Like, her history?


268
00:18:09.209 --> 00:18:10.209
Uh...

269
00:18:10.961 --> 00:18:13.964
I think, uh, you know,
what I see is what I get.


270
00:18:14.047 --> 00:18:15.591
She was a street dog.

271
00:18:16.383 --> 00:18:18.468
Used to scrapping to survive.

272
00:18:18.552 --> 00:18:19.720
All right. Cool.

273
00:18:20.554 --> 00:18:23.223
She's gonna be the first shelter dog
to make the K9 unit.


274
00:18:23.307 --> 00:18:24.308
Um...

275
00:18:25.475 --> 00:18:26.310
Okay.

276
00:18:28.604 --> 00:18:29.771
She's a handful.

277
00:18:30.689 --> 00:18:33.317
Uh, you know, I like a challenge.

278
00:18:33.859 --> 00:18:35.861
- That's for you.
- Thank you kindly.


279
00:18:36.612 --> 00:18:37.905
Know what? This is for you.

280
00:18:37.988 --> 00:18:39.781
Oh! Thanks.

281
00:18:39.865 --> 00:18:42.492
- Some food here.
- Okay. Thank you.


282
00:18:42.576 --> 00:18:44.661
There's goodness in you, okay?

283
00:18:45.370 --> 00:18:47.456
Don't be afraid to let it show.

284
00:18:48.957 --> 00:18:50.083
Here we go.

285
00:18:50.167 --> 00:18:53.337
- Oh. Wow! Okay...
- Yep.


286
00:18:54.129 --> 00:18:55.714
- Anything else?
- Nope, that's it.


287
00:18:55.797 --> 00:18:56.924
I'm just kidding. All right.

288
00:18:57.633 --> 00:18:58.926
- All right.
- All right.


289
00:18:59.009 --> 00:19:01.011
Thank you. Have a good one.

290
00:19:01.094 --> 00:19:02.638
- Thank you.
- Get the door for you.


291
00:19:03.764 --> 00:19:05.933
- There you go. All right.
- Hold on.


292
00:19:06.016 --> 00:19:08.435
- See ya.
- Shall we go home? Yeah, come on.


293
00:19:12.105 --> 00:19:15.609
- She's going with him. That's a good sign.
- Yeah, it's good.


294
00:19:23.450 --> 00:19:25.911
I'd fall apart if I got
that attached to every animal here.


295
00:19:29.456 --> 00:19:32.459
It's okay. It's gonna be okay.

296
00:19:34.628 --> 00:19:36.380
All right, Ruby. You ready?

297
00:19:36.797 --> 00:19:38.757
All right. Hold on.

298
00:19:40.467 --> 00:19:41.969
- Hi.
- A dog.


299
00:19:42.052 --> 00:19:43.345
- Yeah.
- Oh, wow.


300
00:19:43.428 --> 00:19:46.390
You wanted to know the plan.
This is the plan.


301
00:19:48.183 --> 00:19:49.434
Hey, no!

302
00:19:49.518 --> 00:19:50.644
Ruby?

303
00:19:59.861 --> 00:20:01.113
Ruby, hey.

304
00:20:01.196 --> 00:20:02.196
Ruby, no.

305
00:20:02.781 --> 00:20:05.367
Okay, Ruby. No. Out... Outside.

306
00:20:05.951 --> 00:20:07.536
Uh-uh. Outside.

307
00:20:08.287 --> 00:20:09.413
I'm sorry, honey.

308
00:20:09.496 --> 00:20:11.999
Has Zarella ever taken
a shelter dog in the K9 unit?


309
00:20:12.082 --> 00:20:13.500
Not yet, no.

310
00:20:13.583 --> 00:20:16.336
Ruby, come on. Come on. Hey!

311
00:20:16.920 --> 00:20:19.381
All right. Come on. Come on.

312
00:20:22.884 --> 00:20:24.720
Ah! Ruby did that.

313
00:20:24.803 --> 00:20:27.264
Yeah. Yeah.

314
00:20:28.390 --> 00:20:30.225
Oh no, honey. No. 
Not near there.

315
00:20:30.851 --> 00:20:33.562
Yeah, we're gonna be
doing this for a while, aren't we?


316
00:20:33.645 --> 00:20:35.647
Yeah, Dad's tired, so...

317
00:20:36.481 --> 00:20:37.733
Where you going, bud?

318
00:20:39.067 --> 00:20:41.028
- Where you going?
- Read the book.


319
00:20:41.111 --> 00:20:42.471
You want... The book's right here.

320
00:20:43.530 --> 00:20:46.950
Different book? You need
to pick a different book? All right.


321
00:20:48.535 --> 00:20:50.370
Hey, Ruby. Ah!

322
00:20:52.205 --> 00:20:54.374
All right, just... just hold that. Hang on.

323
00:21:03.842 --> 00:21:05.886
Okay, Ruby, come on. Good girl.

324
00:21:06.845 --> 00:21:08.597
- Wait. No.
- No, no, no. No!


325
00:21:08.680 --> 00:21:09.680
No!

326
00:21:10.140 --> 00:21:12.809
- Hey! No, no, no, no, no.
- Ruby. Ruby.


327
00:21:13.518 --> 00:21:14.603
Ruby.

328
00:21:17.064 --> 00:21:19.191
Hey! Come here. No. Yeah.

329
00:21:20.442 --> 00:21:22.819
- Scoot. Yeah. Good girl.
- What are you doing?


330
00:21:23.403 --> 00:21:26.823
She's like a foster kid.
She needs structure and stability.


331
00:21:27.949 --> 00:21:29.159
You read this?

332
00:21:30.160 --> 00:21:32.120
- Skimmed it, yeah.
- Uh-huh.


333
00:21:35.123 --> 00:21:36.792
I'm so happy about the baby.

334
00:21:38.919 --> 00:21:41.505
Me too. But not about the dog.

335
00:21:41.588 --> 00:21:43.048
Look, she's clever.

336
00:21:43.131 --> 00:21:44.883
She has raw talent.

337
00:21:45.926 --> 00:21:48.345
No! Off! Get off!

338
00:21:48.428 --> 00:21:50.806
Ruby. Yeah, okay. All right.

339
00:21:52.265 --> 00:21:54.059
Come on. Come on.

340
00:21:55.018 --> 00:21:58.480
- I just need to bond with her.
- I know. Maybe just bond out there.


341
00:21:58.563 --> 00:21:59.731
Yeah, all right.

342
00:22:00.774 --> 00:22:01.942
Yeah. Ruby.

343
00:22:02.692 --> 00:22:04.236
Come on. Come on.

344
00:22:04.319 --> 00:22:05.612
Yeah. Hold on.

345
00:22:05.695 --> 00:22:07.030
Come on. No.

346
00:22:07.114 --> 00:22:09.616
- Off, off, off!
- I'm sorry, Mel.


347
00:22:09.699 --> 00:22:12.452
Come on, Ruby. 
Please. Come on, let's go.

348
00:22:15.163 --> 00:22:16.706
Yeah.

349
00:22:20.293 --> 00:22:22.629
Okay, Ruby. Your water.

350
00:22:24.631 --> 00:22:25.632
Okay.

351
00:22:29.761 --> 00:22:30.761
Come on.

352
00:22:35.392 --> 00:22:36.392
All right.

353
00:22:37.686 --> 00:22:39.771
She'll come around, all right?

354
00:22:41.690 --> 00:22:43.066
She'll come around.

355
00:22:48.155 --> 00:22:49.739
He's sleeping with her?

356
00:22:53.034 --> 00:22:56.413
Hey, O'Neil! Tell your dog to shut up.

357
00:23:03.128 --> 00:23:05.839
Happy Saturday.
Your wife's gonna love that.


358
00:23:08.300 --> 00:23:11.219
Hi. Morning...

359
00:23:16.516 --> 00:23:20.103
He's lost his monkey.
It's probably out there somewhere.


360
00:23:20.187 --> 00:23:21.229
Monks.

361
00:23:25.859 --> 00:23:26.735
Wow.

362
00:23:26.818 --> 00:23:29.029
The last 18.5 hours
have felt like an eternity.


363
00:23:29.821 --> 00:23:32.282
Mm.

364
00:23:33.867 --> 00:23:34.867
Mel.

365
00:23:35.785 --> 00:23:37.787
That's amazing. Mel!

366
00:23:37.871 --> 00:23:40.624
Honey, I... I can't. 
It's too much.

367
00:23:40.707 --> 00:23:43.668
No, yeah, I'm gonna take her
to an obedience class this morning.


368
00:23:43.752 --> 00:23:45.754
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.


369
00:23:45.837 --> 00:23:48.965
Yeah. I just need to, um,
find one and sign her up.


370
00:23:49.674 --> 00:23:52.511
Perfect. Perfect.
Keep them close.


371
00:23:52.594 --> 00:23:53.594
Stop.

372
00:23:54.554 --> 00:23:55.430
Wonderful.

373
00:23:55.514 --> 00:23:57.265
- Okay.
- All right, come on.


374
00:23:57.349 --> 00:24:00.685
Come on. We're going to the library first.
We're going to the library.


375
00:24:00.769 --> 00:24:01.769
Oh boy.

376
00:24:02.354 --> 00:24:04.105
Sorry. I'm late.

377
00:24:04.189 --> 00:24:05.690
Come in. Come in.

378
00:24:06.983 --> 00:24:09.027
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey! Sorry!

379
00:24:11.488 --> 00:24:13.823
Your dog is aggressive.

380
00:24:13.907 --> 00:24:15.784
It needs socialization.

381
00:24:18.537 --> 00:24:19.788
Yeah.

382
00:24:20.413 --> 00:24:23.625
She doesn't need a class.
She needs medication.


383
00:24:23.708 --> 00:24:26.503
Ruby! Sorry! Sorry!

384
00:24:26.586 --> 00:24:28.922
Jeez. Unbelievable!

385
00:24:40.016 --> 00:24:41.643
Ruby. Ruby.

386
00:24:41.726 --> 00:24:44.062
Hey. You see those dogs out there?

387
00:24:44.145 --> 00:24:45.772
Ruby, you see those dogs out there?

388
00:24:47.566 --> 00:24:48.858
That could be you.

389
00:24:51.111 --> 00:24:52.988
I thought you'd be grateful

390
00:24:53.071 --> 00:24:55.865
to have a family, a great job.

391
00:24:58.034 --> 00:24:59.244
Purpose in life.

392
00:25:00.495 --> 00:25:02.080
Excellent. Go ahead and reward him.

393
00:25:04.916 --> 00:25:06.626
I thought I was good with animals.

394
00:25:08.044 --> 00:25:09.838
I thought we had a connection.

395
00:25:11.881 --> 00:25:13.550
Getting out? You gonna join me?

396
00:25:13.633 --> 00:25:14.633
Uh...

397
00:25:15.218 --> 00:25:16.428
No, we're, uh...

398
00:25:17.846 --> 00:25:19.931
We're heading back to the shelter.

399
00:25:21.433 --> 00:25:22.601
She's impossible.

400
00:25:22.684 --> 00:25:24.436
You know, she doesn't listen.

401
00:25:24.519 --> 00:25:28.064
She destroys everything.

402
00:25:30.358 --> 00:25:31.776
You're giving up on her.

403
00:25:33.987 --> 00:25:34.987
Uh...

404
00:25:36.323 --> 00:25:38.325
Who's gonna believe in her if you don't?

405
00:25:41.202 --> 00:25:42.871
Who believes in you?

406
00:25:44.331 --> 00:25:45.957
I've been lucky that way.

407
00:25:47.667 --> 00:25:51.212
Well, maybe that dog
deserves some of your luck.


408
00:26:02.140 --> 00:26:03.475
If you'll try,

409
00:26:04.351 --> 00:26:05.935
I'll give you my all.

410
00:26:08.438 --> 00:26:10.065
Ruby, you see this basket?

411
00:26:11.066 --> 00:26:12.609
All my eggs are in it.

412
00:26:19.991 --> 00:26:21.201
Oh boy.

413
00:26:24.496 --> 00:26:26.039
Where's your leash? Here it is.

414
00:26:28.083 --> 00:26:29.125
Come on.

415
00:26:29.209 --> 00:26:31.836
Wait, Ruby, Ruby.
Hold on. Hold on, hold on.


416
00:26:43.056 --> 00:26:46.476
I'm sorry, Mel. I couldn't
take her back to the shelter. I...


417
00:26:47.727 --> 00:26:48.937
She loves it here.

418
00:26:49.854 --> 00:26:51.314
She wants to be our dog.

419
00:26:52.023 --> 00:26:53.233
I know she does.

420
00:26:56.027 --> 00:26:57.028
You do?

421
00:27:00.782 --> 00:27:02.992
- I realized something.
- What?


422
00:27:03.076 --> 00:27:04.619
She reminds me of you.

423
00:27:04.703 --> 00:27:06.204
Of me?

424
00:27:06.287 --> 00:27:08.373
- I'm nothing like her.
- You are.


425
00:27:08.456 --> 00:27:12.210
You're always busy, always enthusiastic,
going a mile a minute.


426
00:27:12.293 --> 00:27:14.254
Maybe all she needs is routine.

427
00:27:15.004 --> 00:27:16.589
Unconditional love.

428
00:27:18.883 --> 00:27:20.135
And a crate.

429
00:27:26.182 --> 00:27:27.684
Thank you.

430
00:27:34.482 --> 00:27:35.482
Monks.

431
00:27:37.527 --> 00:27:40.655
She needs to be a family dog first
and a K9 dog second.


432
00:27:40.739 --> 00:27:43.366
- She can be both.
- Okay.


433
00:27:43.450 --> 00:27:45.160
Welcome to our family.

434
00:28:04.429 --> 00:28:06.306
I don't know if I can take it.

435
00:28:06.389 --> 00:28:07.557
It's heartbreaking.

436
00:28:08.349 --> 00:28:12.812
These sites say I've to be the alpha male,
but there are two approaches to training.


437
00:28:12.896 --> 00:28:15.857
Positive with rewards,
or negative with punishment.


438
00:28:17.400 --> 00:28:18.443
Mmm.

439
00:28:21.154 --> 00:28:22.154
Hmm.

440
00:28:22.197 --> 00:28:24.407
The positive one only. Ever.

441
00:28:25.867 --> 00:28:27.869
And make sure Ruby knows what you want.

442
00:28:29.788 --> 00:28:32.791
Don't be sad, Ruby. Don't be sad.

443
00:28:33.625 --> 00:28:35.505
- Don't be sad, Ruby.
- I... I can't.


444
00:28:40.757 --> 00:28:43.134
You didn't want to pee, huh? Come on.

445
00:28:44.427 --> 00:28:45.427
Did she go?

446
00:28:46.471 --> 00:28:47.597
Um...

447
00:28:49.182 --> 00:28:50.225
She did.

448
00:28:51.476 --> 00:28:52.560
Just now.

449
00:28:55.605 --> 00:28:58.024
I think she's claiming this as her home.

450
00:28:58.107 --> 00:29:01.152
- Oh, is that what she's doing?
- I believe so.


451
00:29:02.570 --> 00:29:04.155
- Thank you.
- Welcome.


452
00:29:07.116 --> 00:29:10.411
You're embarrassing me.
And you're embarrassing yourself.


453
00:29:10.954 --> 00:29:12.372
But you don't even care.

454
00:29:20.547 --> 00:29:22.841
See, Ruby? We do this outside.

455
00:29:24.551 --> 00:29:25.969
Huh? Wanna give it a try?

456
00:29:26.678 --> 00:29:27.678
Go ahead.

457
00:29:30.640 --> 00:29:32.600
All right, what do you think?

458
00:29:34.936 --> 00:29:36.938
Yeah. Smell that?

459
00:29:42.110 --> 00:29:43.611
Good dog!

460
00:29:43.695 --> 00:29:46.531
Good girl! Yeah, you did it!

461
00:29:46.614 --> 00:29:48.491
I can't believe that worked.

462
00:29:48.575 --> 00:29:50.368
All right, sit.

463
00:29:50.451 --> 00:29:51.286
Sit.

464
00:29:51.369 --> 00:29:53.621
Okay, all right. 
One thing at a time.

465
00:29:54.414 --> 00:29:56.291
You want this? 
Want your stick?

466
00:29:56.374 --> 00:29:58.501
Yeah. You want your stick?

467
00:30:35.371 --> 00:30:37.457
Which one of you jokers took my panini?

468
00:30:46.674 --> 00:30:47.884
- Hey.
- Hey.


469
00:30:47.967 --> 00:30:50.178
I'd like you to see something.

470
00:30:50.261 --> 00:30:52.263
It's off the kitchen video camera.

471
00:30:53.014 --> 00:30:54.014
Okay.

472
00:31:07.570 --> 00:31:10.114
You owe me a meatball panini, O'Neil.

473
00:31:10.198 --> 00:31:11.198
Yes, Sarge.

474
00:31:13.368 --> 00:31:16.746
Ruby, come on. No. Come on.

475
00:31:16.829 --> 00:31:18.414
All right, stay. Stay.

476
00:31:19.332 --> 00:31:20.332
Stay.

477
00:31:27.840 --> 00:31:29.592
Ruby. Ruby.

478
00:31:32.762 --> 00:31:34.055
Be the solution.

479
00:31:34.722 --> 00:31:36.057
Not the problem.

480
00:31:36.808 --> 00:31:38.184
Please, Ruby.

481
00:31:59.956 --> 00:32:03.209
<i>At this point,
we're just trying to condition your dog.</i>


482
00:32:03.292 --> 00:32:04.919
<i>Click means reward.</i>

483
00:32:06.045 --> 00:32:10.091
<i>So what you do now is reward your dog
for doing what you want.</i>


484
00:32:10.174 --> 00:32:11.467
<i>Right? Yes.</i>

485
00:32:11.551 --> 00:32:13.928
<i>It's saying, "Yes, I like what you did."</i>

486
00:32:14.012 --> 00:32:15.054
<i>"Good dog."</i>

487
00:32:15.138 --> 00:32:19.225
<i>Soon your dog will be able to perform
the commands without the click at all.</i>


488
00:32:22.687 --> 00:32:23.938
Sit.

489
00:32:24.022 --> 00:32:26.232
Sit, please.

490
00:32:29.402 --> 00:32:30.611
Sit, Ruby.

491
00:32:31.654 --> 00:32:32.654
Sit.

492
00:32:33.573 --> 00:32:34.782
Sit down.

493
00:32:35.992 --> 00:32:37.493
Ruby, sit down.

494
00:32:37.577 --> 00:32:39.996
Sit down!

495
00:32:40.580 --> 00:32:41.580
Sit.

496
00:32:43.958 --> 00:32:46.210
Maybe I'm deaf.

497
00:32:46.294 --> 00:32:49.589
Or maybe I'm pretending to be deaf.

498
00:32:53.551 --> 00:32:56.095
Mel. Can you hear this?

499
00:32:56.179 --> 00:32:58.639
- 'Cause it's not working.
- Maybe it's the reward.


500
00:33:03.853 --> 00:33:04.853
Hmm.

501
00:33:10.777 --> 00:33:12.153
Here we go again.

502
00:33:14.363 --> 00:33:16.407
Hi. Do you remember me?

503
00:33:16.491 --> 00:33:18.117
I... I took Ruby home.

504
00:33:18.201 --> 00:33:20.620
She's not responding to clicker training,

505
00:33:20.703 --> 00:33:22.955
and I... I was hoping for some advice.

506
00:33:23.664 --> 00:33:26.834
- You're not bringing her back?
- No.


507
00:33:26.918 --> 00:33:30.171
Raw hot dog.
She will do anything for raw hot dog.


508
00:33:30.254 --> 00:33:31.964
I... I should have told you.

509
00:33:32.048 --> 00:33:33.674
Raw hot dog? All right, good.

510
00:33:33.758 --> 00:33:37.220
Uh, yeah.
That's all I needed to know, so thank you.


511
00:33:37.303 --> 00:33:38.303
Thanks.

512
00:33:39.806 --> 00:33:42.183
The taller the hat, the closer to God.

513
00:33:45.645 --> 00:33:47.271
Sit.

514
00:33:47.355 --> 00:33:49.649
Good girl! Good girl!

515
00:33:49.732 --> 00:33:50.983
Good girl. Okay.

516
00:33:51.067 --> 00:33:53.402
All right, ready? Okay. 
Let's do it again.

517
00:33:53.486 --> 00:33:55.446
Come on. Come on! Sit!

518
00:33:56.405 --> 00:33:57.865
Sit.

519
00:33:57.949 --> 00:34:00.618
Oh my God! Good girl!

520
00:34:00.701 --> 00:34:02.912
Oh my God, you're so good.

521
00:34:02.995 --> 00:34:05.373
You're so smart.
All right, come on. Come on.


522
00:34:05.456 --> 00:34:07.333
One more time.

523
00:34:07.917 --> 00:34:09.127
Good girl.

524
00:34:09.210 --> 00:34:10.545
Yep, stay right there.

525
00:34:14.090 --> 00:34:15.091
Come on.

526
00:34:16.467 --> 00:34:17.467
Okay.

527
00:34:19.804 --> 00:34:22.265
Come on.

528
00:34:22.348 --> 00:34:23.349
Go get it!

529
00:34:24.183 --> 00:34:25.183
Pick it up.

530
00:34:25.977 --> 00:34:27.103
Good girl.

531
00:34:27.186 --> 00:34:28.186
All right!

532
00:34:29.105 --> 00:34:30.690
Come here. Come on. Go get it.

533
00:34:36.362 --> 00:34:37.655
Okay...

534
00:34:38.322 --> 00:34:39.323
Oh my God.

535
00:34:39.991 --> 00:34:41.075
Home.

536
00:34:42.285 --> 00:34:44.579
Ruby, you need an off switch.

537
00:34:45.913 --> 00:34:48.082
I could hire you
out to the power company.

538
00:34:48.166 --> 00:34:49.667
I could hire you both out.

539
00:34:55.923 --> 00:34:58.843
- Ruby ready for tomorrow?
- She has to be.


540
00:34:58.926 --> 00:35:00.344
Can she sit and stay?

541
00:35:00.428 --> 00:35:02.430
- Everything but.
- Uh-oh.


542
00:35:02.513 --> 00:35:03.723
Just like you.

543
00:35:03.806 --> 00:35:07.393
- I'm sitting. I'm staying.
- But you're about to go do something.


544
00:35:07.476 --> 00:35:09.854
I left the hose running.

545
00:35:21.282 --> 00:35:22.825
- Are you nervous?
- Hmm?


546
00:35:22.909 --> 00:35:24.118
Maybe just get up.

547
00:35:44.305 --> 00:35:45.848
All right. Come here, Rubes.

548
00:35:49.185 --> 00:35:51.145
Yeah. Good girl.

549
00:35:53.898 --> 00:35:55.775
She loves that.

550
00:36:01.197 --> 00:36:03.366
- I couldn't sleep either.
- Yeah.


551
00:36:17.129 --> 00:36:18.506
I have faith in you.

552
00:36:19.548 --> 00:36:21.634
You need to have faith in yourself.

553
00:36:23.928 --> 00:36:24.762
Thank you.

554
00:36:39.277 --> 00:36:40.277
Come on.

555
00:36:51.831 --> 00:36:55.084
Come on, come on, come on.
Okay. Hey. Good.


556
00:36:55.167 --> 00:36:56.961
Sit. Sit. Good.

557
00:37:00.756 --> 00:37:01.756
Morning.

558
00:37:04.051 --> 00:37:06.679
Welcome to the tryouts
for this year's K9 academy.


559
00:37:10.433 --> 00:37:11.684
Who do we have there?

560
00:37:13.561 --> 00:37:15.479
Um... Ruby.

561
00:37:16.856 --> 00:37:17.856
Welcome, Ruby.

562
00:37:19.191 --> 00:37:22.320
All right, dogs in the pen
while we get started inside.


563
00:37:25.448 --> 00:37:28.909
Now, you're not trying out
for the K9 unit today.


564
00:37:29.577 --> 00:37:31.662
You're trying out for my class,

565
00:37:31.746 --> 00:37:35.374
which may or may not
qualify you to be a K9 unit officer.


566
00:37:36.083 --> 00:37:37.918
If you are accepted,

567
00:37:38.502 --> 00:37:41.130
these will be six weeks
of rigorous training.


568
00:37:41.213 --> 00:37:45.051
Then you must pass
a final exam for certification,


569
00:37:45.134 --> 00:37:49.055
which certifies you to work
in a K9 unit here or in another state.


570
00:37:49.138 --> 00:37:50.306
A final point.

571
00:37:56.270 --> 00:37:59.565
Your dog must have the right temperament.

572
00:38:01.067 --> 00:38:02.109
So must you.

573
00:38:04.070 --> 00:38:08.199
Search and rescue requires
calm focus and special compassion.


574
00:38:09.700 --> 00:38:12.703
You will deal with people
who are missing loved ones


575
00:38:12.787 --> 00:38:14.205
who might not return.

576
00:38:16.499 --> 00:38:17.875
Ask yourself now,

577
00:38:19.710 --> 00:38:21.003
is this work for you?

578
00:38:22.338 --> 00:38:26.217
Those of you who are sure,
come on outside. Let's see how you do.


579
00:38:31.222 --> 00:38:32.431
Boden, come on up.

580
00:38:33.808 --> 00:38:34.808
<i>Platz.</i>

581
00:38:36.477 --> 00:38:37.477
<i>Fuss.</i>

582
00:38:38.813 --> 00:38:40.231
<i>Schnell! Schnell! Schnell!</i>

583
00:38:41.399 --> 00:38:42.650
Ha!

584
00:38:43.150 --> 00:38:44.568
Rather good, Renny.

585
00:38:48.489 --> 00:38:49.740
Good boy, Renn.

586
00:38:49.824 --> 00:38:50.824
Up!

587
00:38:53.494 --> 00:38:56.455
- O'Neil, you're up.
- Okay. Let's go, Ruby. Come on.


588
00:38:58.124 --> 00:38:59.542
Ruby, sit.

589
00:39:00.292 --> 00:39:01.292
Down.

590
00:39:02.878 --> 00:39:03.963
Heel.

591
00:39:07.883 --> 00:39:09.760
Good girl. Good girl.

592
00:39:11.095 --> 00:39:13.472
- Good girl.
- Yay, Ruby!


593
00:39:14.807 --> 00:39:16.350
Come on.

594
00:39:16.434 --> 00:39:18.310
Good girl. Good girl.

595
00:39:18.394 --> 00:39:20.980
Come on. Come on. 
Yep, yep, yep.

596
00:39:21.564 --> 00:39:23.524
Good girl! Come on.

597
00:39:25.192 --> 00:39:26.193
All right.

598
00:39:26.277 --> 00:39:27.695
Good Ruby. Come on, up!

599
00:39:29.321 --> 00:39:31.949
Good job! Come on, come on!

600
00:39:32.616 --> 00:39:33.616
Up!

601
00:39:34.285 --> 00:39:35.411
Good girl!

602
00:39:35.911 --> 00:39:37.121
Come on. Come on.

603
00:39:37.705 --> 00:39:38.705
Come on.

604
00:39:39.623 --> 00:39:40.623
Sit.

605
00:39:44.670 --> 00:39:46.046
Tell her to stay.

606
00:39:50.509 --> 00:39:52.052
When I tell you to stay,

607
00:39:52.136 --> 00:39:54.180
you cannot move, no matter what.

608
00:39:56.182 --> 00:39:57.182
Stay!

609
00:40:01.020 --> 00:40:03.522
Pace out ten feet. 
Do not turn around.

610
00:40:05.983 --> 00:40:08.777
I had to drop off Finn at my mom's.
What'd I miss?


611
00:40:08.861 --> 00:40:09.945
They're passing.

612
00:40:11.155 --> 00:40:14.492
She still has to stay for five minutes
with Daniel ten feet away.


613
00:40:16.660 --> 00:40:17.660
Oh boy.

614
00:40:20.915 --> 00:40:22.833
Stay. Please stay.

615
00:41:00.412 --> 00:41:02.706
- Five minutes.
- Yay!


616
00:41:02.790 --> 00:41:05.084
Good girl! Good girl!

617
00:41:08.921 --> 00:41:10.923
Yeah, good girl. 
All right, come on.

618
00:41:11.840 --> 00:41:14.510
Now we test all teams

619
00:41:14.593 --> 00:41:16.762
for drive and a good nose.

620
00:41:18.389 --> 00:41:20.849
Search and rescue is...

621
00:41:20.933 --> 00:41:22.685
Hey, Ruby! Sorry about that.

622
00:41:23.352 --> 00:41:24.645
...serious work for us.

623
00:41:24.728 --> 00:41:27.064
- Hot dogs?
- This is not good.


624
00:41:27.898 --> 00:41:29.316
At least it's not a panini.

625
00:41:29.400 --> 00:41:31.068
- No, hey
- But for K9s,


626
00:41:32.278 --> 00:41:34.530
- each mission is a game.
- Stop. Stop.


627
00:41:34.613 --> 00:41:36.949
- Food is what motivates dogs.
- Stop, stop. Down.


628
00:41:37.032 --> 00:41:38.742
That and pleasing you.

629
00:41:39.618 --> 00:41:41.078
Hey. Stop. Stop.

630
00:41:42.746 --> 00:41:44.081
Just one piece.

631
00:41:44.164 --> 00:41:48.419
Treats are for a job well done.
Not for bribing your dog to behave.


632
00:41:51.755 --> 00:41:55.009
Okay. I know this
will be new to all of you.


633
00:41:55.092 --> 00:41:57.469
I have hidden a human tooth.

634
00:41:58.178 --> 00:42:00.180
Considerate it cadaver material.

635
00:42:00.264 --> 00:42:03.267
It's an exercise
in searching for a dead body.


636
00:42:03.350 --> 00:42:05.394
Today, I want each of you

637
00:42:05.477 --> 00:42:09.315
to scent train your K9
to seek and find that tooth.


638
00:42:14.153 --> 00:42:16.155
Me first? A single tooth?

639
00:42:16.780 --> 00:42:17.780
All right.

640
00:42:19.950 --> 00:42:23.412
You're gonna teach her to do this
using a unique command.


641
00:42:24.330 --> 00:42:26.081
- "Look for it."
- Okay.


642
00:42:26.749 --> 00:42:28.876
Stop. Stop it, Ruby.

643
00:42:28.959 --> 00:42:32.129
Ruby, come on. Ruby, stop.

644
00:42:32.212 --> 00:42:34.965
Your dog's not using her thinking brain.
She's not focused.


645
00:42:35.049 --> 00:42:37.843
- We'll come back to you. Back in line.
- Yes, sir. Yes, sir.


646
00:42:41.263 --> 00:42:44.016
Peter, your dog's had
some minimal search training.


647
00:42:44.099 --> 00:42:45.809
Let's show by example.

648
00:42:49.897 --> 00:42:51.440
- Tell him to search.
- Okay.


649
00:42:51.523 --> 00:42:52.900
Look for it. Look for it.

650
00:42:53.484 --> 00:42:56.195
- How does he know what he's looking for?
- It takes time.


651
00:42:56.278 --> 00:42:58.322
But eventually he will learn

652
00:42:58.405 --> 00:43:00.699
to associate that particular command

653
00:43:00.783 --> 00:43:03.410
with finding cadaver material,
once you click and reward him.


654
00:43:06.622 --> 00:43:08.332
- Ruby!
- Control that K9!


655
00:43:08.415 --> 00:43:09.291
Yeah. Ruby.

656
00:43:09.375 --> 00:43:11.055
Deepen your voice.
Be commanding.


657
00:43:11.126 --> 00:43:12.145
Ruby!

658
00:43:12.169 --> 00:43:13.295
Sorry.

659
00:43:13.379 --> 00:43:15.255
Hey, hey. Come here. Come here.

660
00:43:15.339 --> 00:43:16.799
Ruby.

661
00:43:18.217 --> 00:43:19.301
Ruby.

662
00:43:19.385 --> 00:43:20.594
Ruby!

663
00:43:22.721 --> 00:43:23.721
Ruby!

664
00:43:27.017 --> 00:43:28.477
That's a hell of a bark.

665
00:43:29.311 --> 00:43:32.272
Okay, I want you to tell your dogs
to search for him.


666
00:43:32.356 --> 00:43:34.233
He's a moving target. Let's go.

667
00:43:45.244 --> 00:43:46.870
Ruby! Ruby!

668
00:43:48.330 --> 00:43:49.415
Ruby!

669
00:43:54.545 --> 00:43:55.545
Okay.

670
00:43:57.423 --> 00:43:58.424
Oh boy.

671
00:44:04.847 --> 00:44:05.847
Ruby.

672
00:44:06.348 --> 00:44:09.017
Hey, no! No, no, no, no. Hey.

673
00:44:09.101 --> 00:44:11.395
Ruby, put it down.

674
00:44:12.146 --> 00:44:13.564
Put the stick down!

675
00:44:15.691 --> 00:44:17.609
- Ruby.
- Good job, everyone.


676
00:44:17.693 --> 00:44:19.319
- Go ahead and reward.
- Ruby.


677
00:44:20.154 --> 00:44:22.740
- Put it down.
- What's she playing with there?


678
00:44:22.823 --> 00:44:24.825
Um...

679
00:44:30.789 --> 00:44:33.000
Oh! Retreat! Retreat!

680
00:44:33.584 --> 00:44:34.877
Run! Run!

681
00:44:35.669 --> 00:44:37.171
Hey. Ruby.

682
00:44:37.254 --> 00:44:38.714
Come here.

683
00:44:38.797 --> 00:44:41.008
Ow. Ow!

684
00:44:42.301 --> 00:44:44.219
Ow. Come on. Come on.

685
00:44:51.727 --> 00:44:55.314
It's not Ruby's fault.
She's not bred for this work.


686
00:44:56.523 --> 00:44:59.651
She's half Border collie,
one of the smartest breeds.


687
00:44:59.735 --> 00:45:02.112
She hasn't had all the advantages.

688
00:45:02.196 --> 00:45:04.907
She's all over the place.
She's not focusing on the tasks at hand.


689
00:45:04.990 --> 00:45:06.784
We're not in the class, right?

690
00:45:10.996 --> 00:45:14.249
- Did everybody else qualify?
- You're good at so many other things.


691
00:45:15.292 --> 00:45:17.836
- You gotta be realistic.
- I am.


692
00:45:18.962 --> 00:45:19.962
Sorry.

693
00:45:34.436 --> 00:45:35.729
So what next?

694
00:45:36.772 --> 00:45:37.898
I'm sorry, Mel.

695
00:45:38.899 --> 00:45:40.651
I wanted this for both of us.

696
00:45:41.819 --> 00:45:42.903
For all of us.

697
00:45:44.446 --> 00:45:45.531
A better life.

698
00:45:49.743 --> 00:45:52.162
You know I have a thing for superheroes?

699
00:45:54.331 --> 00:45:55.624
You wanna be one?

700
00:45:58.168 --> 00:45:59.920
Dogs have their noses.

701
00:46:01.421 --> 00:46:03.590
I always thought if I had
a partner with a superpower,


702
00:46:03.674 --> 00:46:05.467
it would cover for my weaknesses.

703
00:46:09.596 --> 00:46:12.558
In trooper academy, you made up
for dyslexia and hyperactivity


704
00:46:12.641 --> 00:46:14.768
with all-nighters and books on tape.

705
00:46:15.686 --> 00:46:18.897
Bigger guys than you
hit you hard in the boxing ring.


706
00:46:18.981 --> 00:46:20.774
You would not drop.

707
00:46:22.359 --> 00:46:26.154
Then you shattered your kneecap
just before that mandatory race,


708
00:46:26.238 --> 00:46:28.907
and you hobbled
the entire two miles in pain.


709
00:46:28.991 --> 00:46:30.367
I came in last.

710
00:46:32.452 --> 00:46:33.620
You finished.

711
00:46:37.583 --> 00:46:39.501
Maybe it's not in the plan.

712
00:46:41.128 --> 00:46:43.338
I can't see a path forward from here.

713
00:46:43.839 --> 00:46:48.135
And sheer willpower's not gonna work.
I could push myself but not Ruby.


714
00:46:53.390 --> 00:46:54.390
Yeah.

715
00:46:55.100 --> 00:46:57.436
A-ticka-ticka-ticka. 
A-ticka-ticka.

716
00:46:57.519 --> 00:46:58.519
Come here...

717
00:46:59.855 --> 00:47:01.189
I know. I know.

718
00:47:03.567 --> 00:47:04.401
House.

719
00:47:04.484 --> 00:47:07.029
I come bearing gifts.

720
00:47:07.779 --> 00:47:11.533
- Are we having a barbecue?
- You chose a dog just like you.


721
00:47:11.617 --> 00:47:14.244
Yeah, you've said that. More than once.

722
00:47:14.328 --> 00:47:17.539
You say you hated school.
You didn't want to sit at your desk.


723
00:47:17.623 --> 00:47:20.918
- You wanted to run around, not read.
- Reading's not my thing.


724
00:47:21.001 --> 00:47:23.837
Teachers underestimated you,
but you have always been smart.


725
00:47:23.921 --> 00:47:27.174
No... You didn't get to the point
where you get to the point.


726
00:47:27.257 --> 00:47:29.301
You would've done better homeschooled.

727
00:47:30.135 --> 00:47:31.887
Didn't really have that back then.

728
00:47:31.970 --> 00:47:35.599
Homeschooling would have
appreciated your differences,


729
00:47:35.682 --> 00:47:37.851
your energy, your passions.

730
00:47:37.935 --> 00:47:41.438
Encouraging your strengths
instead of focusing on your weaknesses,


731
00:47:41.521 --> 00:47:43.815
with lessons tailored to you.

732
00:47:48.236 --> 00:47:49.613
Be right back, buddy.

733
00:47:51.782 --> 00:47:53.825
Your mother's a genius.

734
00:47:55.285 --> 00:47:56.787
Hi, little man. Oh!

735
00:48:10.092 --> 00:48:12.886
Maybe K9 school's not for Ruby.

736
00:48:12.970 --> 00:48:15.931
Maybe what she needs
is one-on-one learning


737
00:48:16.014 --> 00:48:20.102
with a teacher who respects
her unique, special abilities.


738
00:48:21.436 --> 00:48:23.605
More fun, less work,

739
00:48:23.689 --> 00:48:27.651
more quiet figuring things out,
less yelling, right? No bullies.


740
00:48:28.735 --> 00:48:32.531
There's more than one way to pass
that final exam for K9 certification.


741
00:48:33.949 --> 00:48:36.910
Right. I'll use all my vacation days.

742
00:48:36.994 --> 00:48:38.120
Starting tomorrow.

743
00:48:38.203 --> 00:48:39.204
Baby!

744
00:48:40.330 --> 00:48:41.330
Uh...

745
00:48:41.832 --> 00:48:44.251
Doubt there's an audiobook
for this, though.


746
00:48:44.334 --> 00:48:45.836
I'll be your audiobook.

747
00:48:56.763 --> 00:48:57.931
Hey. A-ha.

748
00:48:58.015 --> 00:48:59.391
- Hi, kid.
- Hey.


749
00:48:59.474 --> 00:49:00.684
What is all this stuff?

750
00:49:00.767 --> 00:49:03.979
K9 dogs have to get used
to seeing gruesome stuff.


751
00:49:04.062 --> 00:49:05.689
- Oh, I get it.
- Come on.


752
00:49:06.773 --> 00:49:07.773
Good!

753
00:49:12.529 --> 00:49:13.530
Find it.

754
00:49:22.164 --> 00:49:25.292
Good. Good girl!
You found the phone.


755
00:49:27.586 --> 00:49:29.212
- Good!
- Whoo!


756
00:49:34.676 --> 00:49:36.803
She sure has come a long way. Huh?

757
00:49:40.182 --> 00:49:41.516
Hey! We're rich!

758
00:49:42.726 --> 00:49:44.519
Whoa! That real?

759
00:49:44.603 --> 00:49:45.603
Yeah.

760
00:49:46.605 --> 00:49:49.274
- From my dentist.
- Explain this one more time.


761
00:49:49.357 --> 00:49:52.319
For a missing person, you wouldn't
give Ruby something of theirs to sniff?


762
00:49:52.402 --> 00:49:55.072
No. She's learning
to seek human scent only.


763
00:49:55.155 --> 00:49:57.755
So she'll know what to search for
based on the command I give her.


764
00:49:57.783 --> 00:50:01.995
It could be something touched by a person,
or it could be a person, dead or alive.


765
00:50:02.579 --> 00:50:05.707
Hey, Daniel. We figured
Ruby could use some socializing.


766
00:50:06.875 --> 00:50:08.668
Our dogs could use it as well.

767
00:50:08.752 --> 00:50:09.752
Ah.

768
00:50:10.712 --> 00:50:11.588
Nice.

769
00:50:22.891 --> 00:50:25.227
Told ya.
They're all talking about it.


770
00:50:34.945 --> 00:50:36.530
- There you go.
- Thank you.


771
00:50:37.405 --> 00:50:38.965
- Gansett?
- Thank you.


772
00:50:45.747 --> 00:50:48.125
- Free burgers, Danny boy.
- That's right.


773
00:50:48.208 --> 00:50:49.835
Free beer!

774
00:50:49.918 --> 00:50:51.628
- You nervous about tomorrow?
- No.


775
00:50:51.711 --> 00:50:53.213
- Liar.
- Yep.


776
00:50:53.296 --> 00:50:55.382
- You want me to come?
- No.


777
00:50:56.508 --> 00:50:58.718
If we fail,
I won't be able to look at you.


778
00:50:59.678 --> 00:51:00.678
Okay.

779
00:51:05.267 --> 00:51:08.145
"The K9 certification exam
is given once a year."


780
00:51:08.228 --> 00:51:11.565
"It requires handler and K9
to seek three specific items


781
00:51:11.648 --> 00:51:14.317
along an outdoor course in 30 minutes."

782
00:51:26.037 --> 00:51:27.747
Okay, just this once.

783
00:51:42.012 --> 00:51:43.597
Good girl, Ruby.

784
00:51:45.891 --> 00:51:47.811
The past six weeks have been a journey.

785
00:51:49.519 --> 00:51:51.813
Look who's here. Daniel O'Neil.

786
00:51:52.397 --> 00:51:54.757
Nowhere in your book
does it say we have to take your class,


787
00:51:54.816 --> 00:51:56.359
only pass your final test.

788
00:51:56.443 --> 00:51:59.172
- Yeah. Come on. Let 'em try.
- They've worked hard, earned the right.


789
00:51:59.196 --> 00:52:00.697
I was just gonna say...

790
00:52:02.324 --> 00:52:04.492
It's nice to see you back, Daniel O'Neil.

791
00:52:06.661 --> 00:52:08.205
This is how it will work.

792
00:52:08.788 --> 00:52:12.167
Each team will get 30 minutes
to find three things.


793
00:52:12.250 --> 00:52:13.752
Cell phone,

794
00:52:13.835 --> 00:52:16.004
firearm, human remains.

795
00:52:17.088 --> 00:52:18.965
First up, Peter and Kohl.

796
00:52:19.549 --> 00:52:22.636
- Could we go first?
- You got a plane to catch?


797
00:52:22.719 --> 00:52:25.180
I'm... I'm just anxious.

798
00:52:25.263 --> 00:52:27.015
They can go. It's fine.

799
00:52:28.600 --> 00:52:31.645
Okay. First up, 
Daniel and Ruby.

800
00:52:31.728 --> 00:52:33.146
Come on.

801
00:52:33.230 --> 00:52:35.440
Test starts out here,

802
00:52:36.274 --> 00:52:38.068
finishes inside.

803
00:52:41.446 --> 00:52:44.324
Your time starts now.

804
00:52:44.407 --> 00:52:46.284
Okay, seek. Come on. Seek.

805
00:53:07.889 --> 00:53:09.140
She has it.

806
00:53:13.019 --> 00:53:14.938
First object. Cell phone.

807
00:53:16.898 --> 00:53:19.442
- Good job. Keep going.
- Seek!


808
00:53:44.426 --> 00:53:45.426
She has it.

809
00:53:50.390 --> 00:53:51.891
Second object.

810
00:53:51.975 --> 00:53:53.268
Firearm.

811
00:53:53.351 --> 00:53:57.272
That is two objects
in less than two minutes. Extraordinary.


812
00:53:57.355 --> 00:53:59.482
- Now we head inside.
- Ruby, come on.


813
00:54:00.900 --> 00:54:03.570
Your dogs can relax
until we get back outside.


814
00:54:10.452 --> 00:54:12.370
- Where are they?
- Inside.


815
00:54:14.247 --> 00:54:16.583
- That's not in the manual.
- I know, right?


816
00:54:16.666 --> 00:54:18.460
But they did really good so far.

817
00:54:19.044 --> 00:54:21.880
Zarella's always got
a trick or two up his sleeve.


818
00:54:24.215 --> 00:54:25.925
All right, Ruby. Okay. All right.

819
00:54:27.010 --> 00:54:28.010
Final item.

820
00:54:28.678 --> 00:54:29.846
Human remains.

821
00:54:31.139 --> 00:54:32.849
Right. Now you go on.

822
00:54:33.600 --> 00:54:34.517
Look for it!

823
00:55:41.876 --> 00:55:43.211
Whoa!

824
00:55:44.754 --> 00:55:45.964
What the heck?

825
00:55:51.302 --> 00:55:53.930
- It's a big place.
- We blocked off some wings.


826
00:56:10.280 --> 00:56:11.406
Come on, Ruby.

827
00:56:17.579 --> 00:56:19.164
What's she telling you?

828
00:56:21.249 --> 00:56:23.960
- There are no remains here.
- Are you sure?


829
00:56:25.545 --> 00:56:27.672
You get one wrong, I can't pass you.

830
00:56:33.178 --> 00:56:35.638
Uh, if she says it's not here,
it's not here.


831
00:56:39.809 --> 00:56:42.520
Well, I guess maybe not everyone's
gonna pass today.


832
00:56:44.564 --> 00:56:46.316
But you and Ruby did.

833
00:56:47.650 --> 00:56:48.651
In record time.

834
00:56:49.652 --> 00:56:50.778
It was a negative search.

835
00:56:50.862 --> 00:56:53.948
Sometimes you're gonna be sent for things
that end up not being there.


836
00:56:54.491 --> 00:56:55.867
Congratulations!

837
00:56:56.910 --> 00:56:58.703
Good girl. Thank you.

838
00:56:58.786 --> 00:57:00.973
- You've done good.
- Good girl.


839
00:57:00.997 --> 00:57:02.081
Both of you.

840
00:57:05.543 --> 00:57:06.419
We passed!

841
00:57:06.503 --> 00:57:07.879
Oh!

842
00:57:07.962 --> 00:57:09.722
- We passed!
- Yes!


843
00:57:10.173 --> 00:57:11.813
- Well done.
- That was great.


844
00:57:12.509 --> 00:57:14.844
- Congratulations.
- Thank you. Hey, Ruby.


845
00:57:15.428 --> 00:57:16.304
Great, Daniel.

846
00:57:16.387 --> 00:57:18.640
- Congrats.
- Thanks. Thank you.


847
00:57:25.730 --> 00:57:27.232
- Great. Good job.
- O'Neil.


848
00:57:28.983 --> 00:57:30.818
I want you to come work for me.

849
00:57:31.819 --> 00:57:32.946
Provisionally.

850
00:57:33.821 --> 00:57:36.658
We gotta see if Ruby's as good
in the real world as she was today.


851
00:57:36.741 --> 00:57:38.243
I'd be honored, sir.

852
00:57:38.326 --> 00:57:39.744
The vest is for her.

853
00:57:39.827 --> 00:57:40.995
Yeah.

854
00:57:41.663 --> 00:57:44.332
Stay ready,
and you won't have to get ready.


855
00:57:47.752 --> 00:57:50.463
Hey, how about that, huh?

856
00:57:50.547 --> 00:57:51.839
How about that?

857
00:57:52.549 --> 00:57:53.883
Good girl.

858
00:57:53.967 --> 00:57:55.426
Ta-da.

859
00:57:55.510 --> 00:57:58.846
Mel, it's too early to party.
I'm provisional.


860
00:57:58.930 --> 00:58:00.223
Be grateful.

861
00:58:01.224 --> 00:58:03.601
- We should've invited Zarella.
- No.


862
00:58:06.104 --> 00:58:07.355
I'll take that.

863
00:58:08.231 --> 00:58:10.692
Good dog. Come on.

864
00:58:10.775 --> 00:58:11.901
Good, Ruby.

865
00:58:17.949 --> 00:58:19.867
Find them! Find them!

866
00:58:24.330 --> 00:58:25.582
Good girl!

867
00:58:25.665 --> 00:58:27.959
Good job, Ruby.

868
00:58:33.548 --> 00:58:35.925
Rube, here we go. Here we go, Ruby.

869
00:58:44.642 --> 00:58:47.228
All right. Yeah, turn, turn.

870
00:58:48.396 --> 00:58:49.606
Turning.

871
00:58:51.107 --> 00:58:52.427
Look who's here.

872
00:58:52.483 --> 00:58:54.110
Yeah.

873
00:58:56.029 --> 00:59:00.241
Hey, did you know if humans disappeared,
the planet would be better off?


874
00:59:00.992 --> 00:59:02.410
But if ants disappeared,

875
00:59:02.493 --> 00:59:04.412
the whole thing
would come apart at the seams.


876
00:59:06.372 --> 00:59:07.790
You're not listening.

877
00:59:09.083 --> 00:59:11.753
Sam, everything's the same,
except for my uniform.


878
00:59:11.836 --> 00:59:14.756
The senior K9 teams
are seizing cash from drug dealers


879
00:59:14.839 --> 00:59:16.341
and apprehending suspects. And...

880
00:59:16.424 --> 00:59:18.426
I've been sitting on my hands for...

881
00:59:19.927 --> 00:59:21.846
months. The leaves have changed.

882
00:59:21.929 --> 00:59:25.058
Being the junior team
means you wait your turn.


883
00:59:31.981 --> 00:59:33.524
- You scared of him?
- I am.


884
00:59:34.692 --> 00:59:35.693
Me too.

885
00:59:40.782 --> 00:59:41.908
Who's that?

886
00:59:43.242 --> 00:59:45.745
That's Zarella.
There's a search down city.


887
00:59:45.828 --> 00:59:47.955
The senior teams are on other calls.

888
00:59:48.039 --> 00:59:51.334
- Text me when you find the stash.
- No. It's not stolen stuff.


889
00:59:52.085 --> 00:59:53.336
It's a murder victim.

890
00:59:54.337 --> 00:59:55.588
I gotta go. Ruby.

891
01:00:11.646 --> 01:00:12.646
All right.

892
01:00:13.231 --> 01:00:14.691
We gotta get this right.

893
01:00:16.693 --> 01:00:17.819
You good to go?

894
01:00:18.444 --> 01:00:20.488
Yeah? All right, thank you.

895
01:00:24.158 --> 01:00:25.326
Don't let me down.

896
01:00:25.993 --> 01:00:27.537
Police have a suspect in custody.

897
01:00:27.620 --> 01:00:29.340
There's a missing person
presumed dead here.


898
01:00:30.081 --> 01:00:31.081
Right.

899
01:00:33.126 --> 01:00:34.877
Show 'em what you can do.

900
01:00:34.961 --> 01:00:36.003
Look for it!

901
01:00:58.192 --> 01:00:59.861
I think she found something.

902
01:01:06.492 --> 01:01:07.493
What you got?

903
01:01:08.494 --> 01:01:09.495
Nothing.

904
01:01:09.579 --> 01:01:11.122
Yeah.

905
01:01:11.205 --> 01:01:12.290
It's clean.

906
01:01:14.417 --> 01:01:16.961
You gotta make the call. Officially.

907
01:01:35.104 --> 01:01:36.189
No body.

908
01:01:58.628 --> 01:01:59.628
What...

909
01:02:02.590 --> 01:02:03.883
All right, Ruby.

910
01:02:07.178 --> 01:02:09.138
Come on, come on, come on, come on.

911
01:02:12.183 --> 01:02:13.684
You just blew it, Ruby.

912
01:02:16.354 --> 01:02:17.772
You blew it!

913
01:02:21.275 --> 01:02:23.903
Zarella's gonna call
and release me from his unit.


914
01:02:25.780 --> 01:02:26.864
I'm so sorry.

915
01:02:26.948 --> 01:02:29.826
No, I'm the stupid jerk
Zarella always thought.


916
01:02:29.909 --> 01:02:32.954
A guy who doesn't know
his own limitations or his dog's.


917
01:02:34.539 --> 01:02:37.917
- I'm sorry, Mel.
- I don't care if you're in the K9 unit.


918
01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:40.586
We can manage without the extra money.

919
01:02:40.670 --> 01:02:42.463
I married you, not your job.

920
01:02:45.550 --> 01:02:47.426
My husband has his own superpowers.

921
01:02:48.803 --> 01:02:49.929
His big heart.

922
01:02:50.471 --> 01:02:52.056
His boundless energy.

923
01:02:52.598 --> 01:02:54.809
His ability to hyper-focus on things.

924
01:02:55.893 --> 01:02:57.395
How he forgives.

925
01:02:58.312 --> 01:02:59.647
How he never gives up.

926
01:03:01.399 --> 01:03:04.110
How he trusts
in something bigger than himself.


927
01:03:11.742 --> 01:03:13.202
I'm keeping this one.

928
01:03:23.087 --> 01:03:25.089
Saving the world isn't the goal, love.

929
01:03:41.772 --> 01:03:42.772
Stop.

930
01:03:44.483 --> 01:03:45.610
Go.

931
01:04:39.789 --> 01:04:40.873
Ruby.

932
01:04:45.753 --> 01:04:46.753
Ruby.

933
01:04:53.094 --> 01:04:54.553
Ruby, come here, girl.

934
01:05:01.435 --> 01:05:02.435
Ruby.

935
01:05:05.606 --> 01:05:06.606
Ruby!

936
01:05:12.029 --> 01:05:13.447
I'm such an idiot.

937
01:05:19.078 --> 01:05:21.622
She's gone, Mel. It's my fault.

938
01:05:22.289 --> 01:05:24.333
I pushed her. I stressed her.

939
01:05:24.917 --> 01:05:26.711
Then I blamed her for not performing.

940
01:05:26.794 --> 01:05:28.838
I didn't think she could do it,
and then she didn't.


941
01:05:28.921 --> 01:05:31.048
I mean, so what if
she's not a K9 dog?

942
01:05:32.174 --> 01:05:33.634
She's still a great dog.

943
01:05:34.260 --> 01:05:36.387
She's our dog. All of ours.

944
01:05:38.848 --> 01:05:40.016
I know.

945
01:05:41.392 --> 01:05:42.560
I'm gonna find her.

946
01:05:43.686 --> 01:05:44.937
Ruby!

947
01:05:47.148 --> 01:05:48.566
Ruby!

948
01:05:50.443 --> 01:05:52.611
Come here. Ruby!

949
01:05:56.907 --> 01:05:58.909
Come on.

950
01:06:05.458 --> 01:06:06.709
Commander, sir.

951
01:06:08.294 --> 01:06:09.879
We found the body.

952
01:06:11.005 --> 01:06:13.007
We got a tip from a neighbor.

953
01:06:13.090 --> 01:06:16.427
Buried under the deck,
covered in three inches of cement.


954
01:06:16.510 --> 01:06:18.554
It's a miracle Ruby even caught the scent.

955
01:06:19.638 --> 01:06:21.265
<i>You made the wrong call.</i>

956
01:06:21.807 --> 01:06:23.893
<i>- You should have trusted your K9.</i>
- I...


957
01:06:30.357 --> 01:06:31.358
Ah.

958
01:06:33.402 --> 01:06:34.862
Ruby!

959
01:06:35.696 --> 01:06:36.696
Ruby!

960
01:06:38.616 --> 01:06:39.784
Ruby!

961
01:06:46.290 --> 01:06:49.126
Hi. Have you seen this dog?

962
01:06:49.210 --> 01:06:50.586
Ruby.

963
01:06:51.712 --> 01:06:52.755
Hmm, no.

964
01:06:52.838 --> 01:06:54.090
- Okay.
- Sorry.


965
01:06:54.173 --> 01:06:55.299
Thank you.

966
01:06:55.925 --> 01:06:57.093
- Bye.
- Thank you.


967
01:06:58.719 --> 01:07:01.013
- Mama.
- Yeah, I know.


968
01:07:01.097 --> 01:07:02.223
Ruby!

969
01:07:03.849 --> 01:07:05.851
Ruby!

970
01:07:06.519 --> 01:07:08.437
I've got you a hot dog, Ruby.

971
01:07:08.521 --> 01:07:09.563
Hot dog.

972
01:07:09.647 --> 01:07:12.650
Ball Park Frank all the way from Fenway.

973
01:07:12.733 --> 01:07:14.068
Fenway.

974
01:07:14.151 --> 01:07:15.569
Ruby!

975
01:07:15.653 --> 01:07:17.071
Ruby.

976
01:07:21.909 --> 01:07:24.954
Uh, Ruby's run away.
Has she come back here?


977
01:07:25.663 --> 01:07:27.123
No. I'm sorry.

978
01:07:27.832 --> 01:07:28.874
Okay...

979
01:07:29.917 --> 01:07:31.085
All right. Thank you.

980
01:07:40.427 --> 01:07:41.427
Uh...

981
01:07:46.809 --> 01:07:49.687
- Uh, sir, I...
<i>- Dan, there's a boy missing.</i>


982
01:07:49.770 --> 01:07:52.439
<i>Bring Ruby and meet the unit.
I'll text you the address.</i>


983
01:07:55.192 --> 01:07:58.445
- Dan!
<i>- Ruby's not here. She ran.</i>


984
01:07:58.529 --> 01:08:02.324
<i>Well, go get her!
You're no K9 unit without a partner.</i>


985
01:08:04.618 --> 01:08:05.452
Sir.

986
01:08:12.042 --> 01:08:13.042
Uh...

987
01:08:13.544 --> 01:08:14.544
All right.

988
01:08:15.921 --> 01:08:16.921
All right.

989
01:08:19.925 --> 01:08:20.968
All right.

990
01:08:24.680 --> 01:08:25.680
All right.

991
01:08:32.271 --> 01:08:33.647
Yeah, get in. Get in.

992
01:08:36.734 --> 01:08:39.236
- I'll take you where you need to go.
- Yeah.


993
01:08:39.320 --> 01:08:40.738
- Which way?
- Go! Go!


994
01:08:43.449 --> 01:08:45.492
Which way? Where are we going?

995
01:08:45.576 --> 01:08:49.705
I lost my driver's license. Weak eyes.
I need to try that Uber thing.


996
01:08:51.457 --> 01:08:52.833
Where's Ruby?

997
01:08:52.917 --> 01:08:55.711
I, uh, wish I knew.
I've been looking all day.


998
01:08:57.671 --> 01:08:59.506
Dogs don't leave a good thing.

999
01:09:03.302 --> 01:09:04.470
I messed up.

1000
01:09:06.013 --> 01:09:09.016
I didn't trust her.
I... I let pressure get to me.


1001
01:09:11.602 --> 01:09:15.105
I did to her what people do to me.
Underestimate me, count me out.


1002
01:09:16.065 --> 01:09:19.068
- That's why I work harder.
- To prove 'em wrong.


1003
01:09:19.151 --> 01:09:20.653
Yeah, you know, to...

1004
01:09:22.446 --> 01:09:23.948
To show I measure up.

1005
01:09:24.949 --> 01:09:28.202
I'm not the stupid hyperactive kid
who couldn't read.


1006
01:09:28.869 --> 01:09:31.038
- And have you proved it?
- Yeah.


1007
01:09:31.705 --> 01:09:33.582
I mean to yourself.

1008
01:09:35.876 --> 01:09:36.876
Sure.

1009
01:09:39.838 --> 01:09:42.841
Turn your blinker on.
Pull over at Katt's here.


1010
01:09:53.352 --> 01:09:56.480
I'm thinking you're the one who's lost,
not Ruby.


1011
01:10:03.946 --> 01:10:06.448
Ruby, where are you?

1012
01:10:09.785 --> 01:10:10.869
Come back!

1013
01:10:17.876 --> 01:10:20.254
You didn't let me down. 
I let you down.

1014
01:10:24.216 --> 01:10:26.093
I'm the one who's gotta change.

1015
01:10:29.972 --> 01:10:31.348
I have to trust.

1016
01:10:33.434 --> 01:10:34.601
Really trust.

1017
01:10:41.191 --> 01:10:42.192
My God.

1018
01:11:04.798 --> 01:11:05.798
Ruby?

1019
01:11:07.384 --> 01:11:08.594
I'm sorry.

1020
01:11:14.183 --> 01:11:16.727
There's a missing boy in Glocester.
It's on the news.


1021
01:11:17.478 --> 01:11:18.562
Zarella called.

1022
01:11:19.688 --> 01:11:21.231
Whole team's mobilized.

1023
01:11:27.529 --> 01:11:29.073
I didn't believe in her.

1024
01:11:31.200 --> 01:11:32.409
Do you know why?

1025
01:11:36.413 --> 01:11:38.123
I don't believe in myself.

1026
01:11:57.101 --> 01:11:57.935
Hey.

1027
01:11:58.018 --> 01:11:59.818
<i>Hey, Danny.
Grinnell's called a meeting.</i>


1028
01:11:59.895 --> 01:12:02.022
<i>- You gotta get in here.</i>
- Okay. Thanks.


1029
01:12:06.110 --> 01:12:09.905
Glocester boy was hiking yesterday
with his mother in familiar woods.


1030
01:12:09.988 --> 01:12:12.533
He took a shortcut home alone
and never showed.


1031
01:12:18.288 --> 01:12:20.624
Zarella's K9 unit has been searching.

1032
01:12:23.085 --> 01:12:25.462
O'Neil. Find your K9.

1033
01:12:29.591 --> 01:12:32.094
And when you do, put
a GPS tracker on her.

1034
01:12:33.512 --> 01:12:34.847
Be safe, everyone.

1035
01:12:47.151 --> 01:12:48.151
Ruby?

1036
01:12:50.904 --> 01:12:52.781
Ruby! Hey!

1037
01:12:52.865 --> 01:12:53.782
Oh.

1038
01:12:55.117 --> 01:12:57.578
I never should have thought
you couldn't do it.


1039
01:12:57.661 --> 01:13:00.164
I never should have doubted you. Or us.

1040
01:13:07.546 --> 01:13:09.798
Let's get you home, all right? Come on.

1041
01:13:10.841 --> 01:13:11.842
Ruby, no.

1042
01:13:17.473 --> 01:13:18.599
You wanna go?

1043
01:13:19.391 --> 01:13:20.767
Let's go to the search.

1044
01:13:25.814 --> 01:13:27.232
Eat 'em all.

1045
01:13:27.316 --> 01:13:28.901
Mel. Mel, hey.

1046
01:13:28.984 --> 01:13:32.738
She's back. She's back. I got her.
We're heading to the search.


1047
01:14:00.349 --> 01:14:02.017
Let's go. Let's go. Good girl.

1048
01:14:02.726 --> 01:14:03.769
O'Neil.

1049
01:14:04.686 --> 01:14:07.272
You ready? You don't look ready.

1050
01:14:07.356 --> 01:14:10.025
- Reporting for duty, sir.
- Can I count on you?


1051
01:14:10.108 --> 01:14:11.860
Never more than now, sir.

1052
01:14:14.238 --> 01:14:15.531
Call everyone back.

1053
01:14:16.031 --> 01:14:18.534
Set up a perimeter.
I need everyone out of those woods.


1054
01:14:19.117 --> 01:14:20.953
I got my best
K9 here ready to go.

1055
01:14:21.828 --> 01:14:24.706
All right, I want Ruby to pick up
the most concentrated scent.


1056
01:14:24.790 --> 01:14:26.917
It should be the boy's,
not one of our guys'.


1057
01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:27.876
You need a coffee?

1058
01:14:27.960 --> 01:14:28.961
- No.
- All right.


1059
01:14:34.967 --> 01:14:36.969
All right. Here's where we are here.

1060
01:14:37.761 --> 01:14:40.931
All of this here is nature preserve.

1061
01:14:41.014 --> 01:14:44.268
Dense woods,
granite outcroppings, a thousand acres.


1062
01:14:45.143 --> 01:14:47.563
They started off here, the boy's home.

1063
01:14:47.646 --> 01:14:49.898
That's the house right behind us.

1064
01:14:49.982 --> 01:14:52.568
They went around and across the pond here.

1065
01:14:52.651 --> 01:14:56.738
That's when Michael went off on his own,
presumably to head back home.


1066
01:14:56.822 --> 01:14:58.657
Best hope is he got lost.

1067
01:14:59.283 --> 01:15:01.577
The terrain is extremely dangerous.

1068
01:15:01.660 --> 01:15:03.328
Lots of widow-makers.

1069
01:15:04.371 --> 01:15:05.539
My other teams

1070
01:15:06.331 --> 01:15:08.083
are tired, hungry.

1071
01:15:08.166 --> 01:15:09.585
They're exhausted.

1072
01:15:10.377 --> 01:15:12.170
He's got very worried parents.

1073
01:15:12.754 --> 01:15:14.298
I want good news for them.

1074
01:15:18.010 --> 01:15:19.428
I know you can do it.

1075
01:15:20.429 --> 01:15:21.346
Find him!

1076
01:15:34.943 --> 01:15:37.070
Don't let one emergency become two!

1077
01:15:40.866 --> 01:15:43.368
- Here, take my hat.
- Okay. Thank you.


1078
01:15:45.495 --> 01:15:47.914
- No one's out there?
- Just you and the boy. Good luck.


1079
01:15:47.998 --> 01:15:49.666
- Good luck, buddy!
- Thanks.


1080
01:17:32.769 --> 01:17:34.062
What? What?

1081
01:17:38.483 --> 01:17:40.323
Good girl, Ruby! Good girl!

1082
01:17:41.737 --> 01:17:42.737
All right.

1083
01:17:46.616 --> 01:17:48.118
Good girl, Ruby. Good girl.

1084
01:17:52.164 --> 01:17:54.708
We have him. We
have him down a cliff.

1085
01:17:54.791 --> 01:17:56.001
<i>We have him.</i>

1086
01:17:58.545 --> 01:17:59.796
Boy's location?

1087
01:18:02.883 --> 01:18:04.176
Boy's condition?

1088
01:18:05.594 --> 01:18:06.636
Daniel.

1089
01:18:08.180 --> 01:18:09.306
He's out of range.

1090
01:18:13.351 --> 01:18:14.478
Michael!

1091
01:18:20.984 --> 01:18:23.111
Michael, I'm coming.

1092
01:18:25.030 --> 01:18:26.031
Michael!

1093
01:18:29.659 --> 01:18:30.869
Michael!

1094
01:18:33.914 --> 01:18:35.874
Good girl! Good girl, Ruby.

1095
01:18:40.670 --> 01:18:42.255
Good, Ruby.

1096
01:18:47.469 --> 01:18:49.846
Good girl, Ruby. Good dog.

1097
01:18:50.430 --> 01:18:51.681
Good dog.

1098
01:18:52.641 --> 01:18:54.559
All right, come on. Michael.

1099
01:18:56.102 --> 01:18:57.604
Michael, can you hear me?

1100
01:18:58.104 --> 01:18:59.147
Good girl. Good girl.

1101
01:19:01.483 --> 01:19:02.692
Michael?

1102
01:19:02.776 --> 01:19:04.611
Hey, Michael, can you hear me?

1103
01:19:07.572 --> 01:19:10.116
We got you, bud. We got you.

1104
01:19:27.801 --> 01:19:30.136
One, two, three, four, five,

1105
01:19:30.220 --> 01:19:32.055
six, seven, eight, nine.

1106
01:19:32.138 --> 01:19:34.140
One, two, three, four,

1107
01:19:34.224 --> 01:19:36.309
five, six, seven, eight, nine.

1108
01:19:43.483 --> 01:19:45.944
Hey. Hey, Michael. Hi.

1109
01:19:46.736 --> 01:19:48.947
Michael, I'm Daniel O'Neil.

1110
01:19:49.781 --> 01:19:51.449
This is Ruby, my K9 partner.

1111
01:19:54.995 --> 01:19:57.789
- Cold.
- You're cold? Here.


1112
01:19:57.873 --> 01:20:00.458
Here, you're cold. 
Here you go, bud.

1113
01:20:00.542 --> 01:20:02.085
Here you go. All right.

1114
01:20:03.461 --> 01:20:05.422
There you go.

1115
01:20:06.631 --> 01:20:08.049
Are you hurt anywhere?

1116
01:20:09.009 --> 01:20:11.386
- My... My leg.
- Your leg?


1117
01:20:12.971 --> 01:20:14.890
- This one?
- Ah!


1118
01:20:14.973 --> 01:20:17.017
Yeah? That hurts? All right.

1119
01:20:17.100 --> 01:20:19.603
Hang on, bud. We got you.

1120
01:20:21.229 --> 01:20:22.355
Okay? Just stay with me.

1121
01:20:26.026 --> 01:20:27.611
This is 223. We have him.

1122
01:20:27.694 --> 01:20:31.156
Forty-one degrees, 54, 42.4 north.

1123
01:20:31.698 --> 01:20:35.201
Seventy-one degrees, 42, 49.2 west.

1124
01:20:36.578 --> 01:20:39.205
Good girl. All right, stay with me, bud.

1125
01:20:40.457 --> 01:20:43.084
We have him. Grave condition. Send medics.

1126
01:20:47.380 --> 01:20:48.506
They can't hear me.

1127
01:21:03.813 --> 01:21:05.231
Hear that barking.

1128
01:21:08.026 --> 01:21:10.403
Shut up! Everyone stop talking!

1129
01:21:10.487 --> 01:21:11.487
Listen.

1130
01:21:15.659 --> 01:21:16.743
That's Ruby.

1131
01:21:22.749 --> 01:21:23.833
Follow me!

1132
01:21:24.417 --> 01:21:25.627
Let's go. Hurry up.

1133
01:21:25.710 --> 01:21:26.711
Let's go! Let's go!

1134
01:21:32.342 --> 01:21:34.719
Right, keep barking, Ruby. Keep barking.

1135
01:21:48.984 --> 01:21:49.984
This way.

1136
01:21:59.869 --> 01:22:01.329
Careful through the water.

1137
01:22:05.709 --> 01:22:07.127
Please keep barking.

1138
01:22:07.669 --> 01:22:08.837
Just hang with me, bud.

1139
01:22:20.974 --> 01:22:22.600
- Daniel!
- Hey!


1140
01:22:23.184 --> 01:22:25.395
- O'Neil, we're here.
- He's alive.


1141
01:22:26.312 --> 01:22:30.150
Hypothermic, possible concussion.
Broken leg, internal injuries.


1142
01:22:30.233 --> 01:22:32.819
- Let's go. We'll get him out.
- All right.


1143
01:22:32.902 --> 01:22:35.238
We're gonna
get you out of here, buddy.


1144
01:22:35.321 --> 01:22:37.115
Yeah. Just stay with me, okay?

1145
01:22:37.198 --> 01:22:38.283
Hang in there.

1146
01:22:39.451 --> 01:22:40.827
Good girl. Good girl.

1147
01:22:42.829 --> 01:22:45.331
Good girl. Good girl. Good girl.

1148
01:22:48.668 --> 01:22:49.961
Oh, thank God.

1149
01:23:01.264 --> 01:23:03.767
The boy's gonna need crutches for a while,

1150
01:23:03.850 --> 01:23:05.518
but he's fine.

1151
01:23:06.895 --> 01:23:09.314
- Thank you.
- Well done, son.


1152
01:23:15.278 --> 01:23:17.489
Thank you for giving me a chance.

1153
01:23:18.782 --> 01:23:19.783
You got it.

1154
01:23:21.910 --> 01:23:23.661
- Couldn't be prouder.
- Thank you.


1155
01:23:26.539 --> 01:23:29.042
We got a very grateful mother here
who wants to say hello.


1156
01:23:29.125 --> 01:23:30.502
Oh, I...

1157
01:23:34.297 --> 01:23:35.297
Wait.

1158
01:23:37.383 --> 01:23:39.135
You're the lady from the shelter.

1159
01:23:40.053 --> 01:23:41.513
<i>You</i>found my son?

1160
01:23:41.596 --> 01:23:43.014
That wasn't me.

1161
01:23:43.681 --> 01:23:44.681
It was Ruby.

1162
01:23:46.309 --> 01:23:48.269
- She led the way.
- Ruby.


1163
01:23:48.353 --> 01:23:50.396
- Go ahead, girl.
- Oh, Ruby.


1164
01:23:51.022 --> 01:23:54.192
Who's a good girl!

1165
01:23:54.275 --> 01:23:56.903
Oh, I knew there was goodness in you.

1166
01:23:58.696 --> 01:24:00.657
You all know each other?

1167
01:24:01.991 --> 01:24:05.120
She was supposed to be put down,
and then he came along.


1168
01:24:06.454 --> 01:24:08.039
You've saved a life, you know?

1169
01:24:08.998 --> 01:24:12.043
And then she saved your son's.

1170
01:24:13.044 --> 01:24:15.588
- Wow.
- Now there's a wink from above.


1171
01:24:15.672 --> 01:24:18.591
- Mrs. Inman?
- Oh, I think they're calling you.


1172
01:24:21.928 --> 01:24:22.928
Thank you.

1173
01:24:23.596 --> 01:24:24.596
Thank you.

1174
01:24:29.394 --> 01:24:30.395
Trooper O'Neil.

1175
01:24:33.898 --> 01:24:35.024
You're official.

1176
01:24:36.109 --> 01:24:38.570
Promoted to full status K9 unit.

1177
01:24:45.326 --> 01:24:48.121
- Thank you.
- Told you he'd come through for you.


1178
01:24:49.038 --> 01:24:50.039
You did.

1179
01:24:51.708 --> 01:24:53.293
But you had him help me?

1180
01:24:54.919 --> 01:24:56.421
He's my best scout.

1181
01:24:59.799 --> 01:25:00.799
Scout?

1182
01:25:02.260 --> 01:25:04.179
Matt's always been rooting for you.

1183
01:25:09.017 --> 01:25:11.269
All right, Ruby. Come on.

1184
01:25:11.352 --> 01:25:13.312
- Thank you, officer.
- Sure. Have a good morning.


1185
01:25:13.354 --> 01:25:14.354
Thank you.

1186
01:25:18.109 --> 01:25:20.028
Hey, Mel. What are you...

1187
01:25:20.111 --> 01:25:21.446
Aw.

1188
01:25:26.951 --> 01:25:29.287
Wow, Daniel.
Unbelievable, man. Great work.


1189
01:25:29.370 --> 01:25:31.581
- Thank you.
- Well done, Dan.


1190
01:25:31.664 --> 01:25:33.875
- Here's your hat.
- Oh! Thanks for the hat.


1191
01:25:33.958 --> 01:25:35.084
Anytime.

1192
01:25:35.168 --> 01:25:37.128

- Thank you.


1193
