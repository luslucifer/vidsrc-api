1
00:01:20.835 --> 00:01:22.490
It's Melissa.

2
00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:26.120
- Hey, honey. I'm on my
way to my orientation.


3
00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:28.160
Ah, yeah, yeah, I, 
I should be home

4
00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:29.690
around four, I would think.

5
00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:31.460
It's a small facility, 
I can't imagine

6
00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:33.320
it will take longer than that,

7
00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:36.020
especially since they dragged
me out here on a Sunday.


8
00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:41.993
Okay, honey. I'll call you later.

9
00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:44.303
Love you too. Bye.

10
00:03:11.443 --> 00:03:13.360
Hello? Is anybody here?

11
00:03:40.422 --> 00:03:42.263
- Dr. Makenzie?

12
00:03:42.263 --> 00:03:45.833
Dr. Tristian Makenzie?
- Ah, yes, that's me.


13
00:03:46.771 --> 00:03:48.890
Ah, you must be Dr. Patterson.

14
00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:50.387
- Actually, I'm Dr. Gabey Moon.

15
00:03:50.387 --> 00:03:52.430
I'm the director of the
residency program here


16
00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:55.040
at Silverdale Psychiatric Hospital.

17
00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:57.365
- Well, it's a pleasure to meet you.

18
00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:02.023
- Oh!

19
00:04:06.333 --> 00:04:07.910
- Was it an accident?

20
00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:10.580
- Carelessness. Never turn
your back on a patient.


21
00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:11.961
This way, please.

22
00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:23.750
This is the administrative wing.

23
00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:26.570
Patients are kept on the
fourth and sixth floor,


24
00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:29.810
oh, depending, of course, on
their current mental condition.


25
00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:31.460
This is where all the
pencil pushing is done.


26
00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:35.420
So we've got Patorius, Durand.

27
00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:36.953
Lucia's around the corner.

28
00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:42.029
And this is the coat closet.

29
00:04:42.029 --> 00:04:44.390
You know, my, my personal
recommendation is don't leave


30
00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:46.010
anything of value behind.

31
00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:49.553
Our cleaning lady's a little
bit of a kleptomaniac.


32
00:04:56.990 --> 00:04:58.313
And this is my office.

33
00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:04.490
Got medical record storage
and decompression room.


34
00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:07.430
Look, I'm sure you can see by now

35
00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:10.370
that we are a very small
state-funded hospital.


36
00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:13.130
We've got 27 residents and five doctors.

37
00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:14.450
- Yes, I see that.

38
00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:17.749
I've worked in my fair
share of smaller facilities.


39
00:05:17.749 --> 00:05:20.570
I've read your file,

40
00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:22.310
but I can tell you that it
doesn't give me the breadth


41
00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:26.313
or depth of which I need
to know, you specifically.


42
00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:37.163
- You are hiring for senior
houseman, are you not?


43
00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:39.683
- Indeed, we are.

44
00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:44.149
Look, Dr. Makenzie, 
I don't want you

45
00:05:44.149 --> 00:05:45.593
to take offense to this.

46
00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:51.500
You seem possibly like
you're maybe more suited


47
00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:54.920
for one of the fashionable facilities,

48
00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:58.163
ones where wealthy old
men are holding your hand


49
00:05:58.163 --> 00:06:01.490
and, and telling you how
horrible their mothers were.


50
00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:03.620
We're a long way from Seattle.

51
00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:05.060
- I've worked with my fair share

52
00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:08.180
of disturbed patients during my training.

53
00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:09.770
If you are trying to warn me

54
00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:12.200
that the patients here
are potentially dangerous,


55
00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:15.110
you needn't worry.
- Dangerous?


56
00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:18.533
Hardly. Disturbed, 
I'll give you that.

57
00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:24.520
And they're also very
extraordinary and strange.


58
00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:27.260
- Huh, strange?

59
00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:28.730
What's the strangest case

60
00:06:28.730 --> 00:06:29.953
that's come from a little place like this?

61
00:06:29.953 --> 00:06:32.510
- Believe me, I've seen
strange things come


62
00:06:32.510 --> 00:06:34.373
and I've seen strange things go,

63
00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:37.850
but the strangest
phenomenon I have ever seen


64
00:06:37.850 --> 00:06:41.660
in my entire career is
a very specific delusion


65
00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:44.180
that's shared by five of our residents.

66
00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:46.733
A very specific delusion.

67
00:06:47.750 --> 00:06:49.790
- Mass suggestion.
- You'd think so.


68
00:06:49.790 --> 00:06:53.540
But upon careful review
and thorough review


69
00:06:53.540 --> 00:06:56.390
of all of their
files, we decided early on

70
00:06:56.390 --> 00:06:59.093
to impose a non-contact
between all of them.


71
00:07:00.140 --> 00:07:03.890
That way we could tease out possibly where

72
00:07:03.890 --> 00:07:05.390
the delusion was coming from

73
00:07:05.390 --> 00:07:09.620
or what the common thread
was between all five.


74
00:07:09.620 --> 00:07:12.260
It's a very specific delusion.

75
00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:14.690
- Well, I look
forward to meeting them all

76
00:07:14.690 --> 00:07:17.138
and assisting in any way I can.

77
00:07:22.758 --> 00:07:23.591
Ah.

78
00:07:30.380 --> 00:07:31.480
Do you wanna see them?

79
00:07:33.609 --> 00:07:34.442
- What?

80
00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:38.753
- The files?

81
00:07:40.850 --> 00:07:44.453
- Oh, yes. I, I'd
love to see the files.

82
00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:07.373
- Cathy McGowin.

83
00:08:09.320 --> 00:08:11.363
She's been here for about five years.

84
00:08:15.650 --> 00:08:20.650
Cathy is a special case.
Possibly the most dangerous.


85
00:08:20.960 --> 00:08:24.350
It's unclear when she began
experiencing the onset symptoms


86
00:08:24.350 --> 00:08:28.550
of paranoid schizophrenia,
but it's also unclear


87
00:08:28.550 --> 00:08:30.710
what happened to her victims.

88
00:09:41.417 --> 00:09:43.000
- Well, this is it.

89
00:09:43.918 --> 00:09:46.418
What do you think?
- It's cute.


90
00:09:47.477 --> 00:09:48.617
And you weren't kidding when you said

91
00:09:48.617 --> 00:09:50.840
you lived out in the sticks.

92
00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:54.290
- Yeah, I like the peace and quiet.

93
00:09:54.290 --> 00:09:55.123
No one around.

94
00:09:56.390 --> 00:09:59.003
It's been a long drive. You
must need another drink.


95
00:10:00.893 --> 00:10:02.518
- Mm-hmm.

96
00:10:02.518 --> 00:10:03.793
Come on.

97
00:10:29.115 --> 00:10:33.410
It's, ah,
it's a nice place you got.


98
00:10:33.410 --> 00:10:36.593
- It's old, nothing works
half the time, but thanks.


99
00:10:38.030 --> 00:10:38.963
- Just you here?

100
00:10:40.880 --> 00:10:41.873
- More or less.

101
00:10:43.700 --> 00:10:45.100
- You grew up in this place?

102
00:10:46.670 --> 00:10:47.770
- Why do you say that?

103
00:10:49.040 --> 00:10:54.040
- Oh, just a big house
for such a small girl.


104
00:10:56.210 --> 00:10:58.362
- It's my parents actually.

105
00:10:58.362 --> 00:10:59.412
Ah.

106
00:11:02.990 --> 00:11:05.753
They, ah, they are around?

107
00:11:10.190 --> 00:11:11.123
- Not anymore.

108
00:11:16.053 --> 00:11:17.253
Good.

109
00:11:21.096 --> 00:11:24.740
So, um, what do you wanna do?

110
00:11:24.740 --> 00:11:26.690
You know, listen to some music, ah,

111
00:11:26.690 --> 00:11:29.762
maybe a little dancing, some music?

112
00:11:29.762 --> 00:11:31.700
Sure.

113
00:11:31.700 --> 00:11:35.247
There's a record player if
you wanna pick something out.


114
00:11:35.247 --> 00:11:36.647
All right.

115
00:11:45.740 --> 00:11:48.650
- I'm gonna use the powder
room and freshen up.


116
00:11:48.650 --> 00:11:49.670
- Sounds good.

117
00:15:07.950 --> 00:15:09.978
- Well, that's an on choice.

118
00:15:09.978 --> 00:15:14.257
Ah, huh. Oh, very nice.

119
00:15:14.257 --> 00:15:18.263
Yeah. It's like it was calling
to me and it's, it's my song.


120
00:15:19.190 --> 00:15:20.023
Mm.

121
00:15:21.410 --> 00:15:23.843
- Listen Glen,

122
00:15:25.250 --> 00:15:26.840
I'm not usually in the business

123
00:15:26.840 --> 00:15:28.583
of bringing random guys home.

124
00:15:29.507 --> 00:15:33.413
Well I, well I hope not.

125
00:15:35.120 --> 00:15:36.053
- Don't tease me.

126
00:15:37.370 --> 00:15:38.930
I've been to bed with six guys,

127
00:15:38.930 --> 00:15:41.513
three boyfriends, three one night stands.

128
00:15:45.650 --> 00:15:46.483
- Good to know.

129
00:15:48.410 --> 00:15:51.113
- I asked you to come back
with me tonight because,


130
00:15:54.295 --> 00:15:56.962
well, I don't wanna sleep alone.

131
00:15:58.070 --> 00:16:00.020
- I don't think anybody does.

132
00:16:00.020 --> 00:16:02.933
I mean, we're all looking for
some sort of companionship.


133
00:16:02.933 --> 00:16:05.390
You know, someone to, someone to touch,

134
00:16:05.390 --> 00:16:09.140
someone to wake up next to.

135
00:16:09.140 --> 00:16:10.940
- That's not what I'm talking about.

136
00:16:15.380 --> 00:16:16.373
- Then what?

137
00:16:21.560 --> 00:16:24.263
- I'm afraid
- Of?


138
00:16:25.940 --> 00:16:27.694
- This house.

139
00:16:27.694 --> 00:16:29.794
What's wrong with this house?

140
00:16:31.700 --> 00:16:34.463
- It's not exactly the
house that I'm afraid of.


141
00:16:36.230 --> 00:16:37.583
- Then what? Come on.

142
00:16:39.020 --> 00:16:41.120
Don't be just scaredy-cat.

143
00:16:41.120 --> 00:16:44.423
- All right, big guy.
What are you scared of?


144
00:16:45.590 --> 00:16:48.320
- Nothing scares me.
- Mm, really?


145
00:16:48.320 --> 00:16:50.303
- I'm serious.
- Come on.


146
00:16:54.890 --> 00:16:56.960
- Okay, well there might be one thing.

147
00:16:56.960 --> 00:16:57.793
- Come on.

148
00:17:00.350 --> 00:17:01.313
- I was a kid.

149
00:17:02.300 --> 00:17:04.043
13, if I remember correctly.

150
00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:08.063
My brother made me participate
in Montezuma's Revenge.


151
00:17:08.900 --> 00:17:13.309
You know what that is? 
Knotts Berry Farm?

152
00:17:13.309 --> 00:17:15.383
Fastest coaster on the West Coast?

153
00:17:17.329 --> 00:17:20.363
What? Not good enough for you?

154
00:17:21.380 --> 00:17:23.933
- That's not what I'm talking about.

155
00:17:25.010 --> 00:17:25.843
Come on.

156
00:17:27.170 --> 00:17:30.113
There's gotta be something
that really scares you.


157
00:17:31.657 --> 00:17:33.710
Maybe something

158
00:17:33.710 --> 00:17:35.003
from when you were a kid,

159
00:17:36.950 --> 00:17:39.023
something that haunts you to this day.

160
00:17:39.950 --> 00:17:42.113
- You know.
- Yeah.


161
00:17:45.596 --> 00:17:47.303
- Hmm. There might be something.

162
00:17:51.080 --> 00:17:54.503
When I was 11, maybe 12,

163
00:17:55.490 --> 00:17:57.200
me and my brother Roy would play

164
00:17:57.200 --> 00:17:58.950
by this old lake during the summer.

165
00:18:01.940 --> 00:18:04.100
I can remember one hot
summer in particular,


166
00:18:04.100 --> 00:18:05.990
we took our fishing poles to this lake.

167
00:18:05.990 --> 00:18:08.750
Do you think you can
catch a catfish?


168
00:18:08.750 --> 00:18:12.830
- Roy sees something furry
floating in the water.


169
00:18:12.830 --> 00:18:16.610
Some, something.

170
00:18:16.610 --> 00:18:19.040
And he starts nudging
it with a tree branch,


171
00:18:19.040 --> 00:18:20.153
closer and closer to the shore.

172
00:18:20.153 --> 00:18:22.130
- Come on, Roy.
- And I can see that it's


173
00:18:22.130 --> 00:18:23.990
some sort of animal.
- What is that?


174
00:18:23.990 --> 00:18:25.910
- Suddenly he's yelling
at me, "Get it, get it!"


175
00:18:25.910 --> 00:18:27.680
So I reach into the water

176
00:18:27.680 --> 00:18:30.750
and I pull out this young Scotty dog.

177
00:18:30.750 --> 00:18:32.990
- Is that a dog?
- And it must've been dead


178
00:18:32.990 --> 00:18:34.610
for a while because it was stiff.

179
00:18:34.610 --> 00:18:36.650
I'm talking stiff as a board.
- What the heck?


180
00:18:36.650 --> 00:18:37.760
- You could've propped this thing up

181
00:18:37.760 --> 00:18:39.460
and it would've stood up straight.

182
00:18:42.050 --> 00:18:43.670
Poor thing must've been dead for a while

183
00:18:43.670 --> 00:18:45.575
because both of its eyes were wide open.

184
00:18:45.575 --> 00:18:47.300
Whoa, look at its eye.

185
00:18:48.410 --> 00:18:50.960
- I'll never forget
looking into those eyes,


186
00:18:50.960 --> 00:18:52.510
had one blue and one green one.

187
00:18:54.320 --> 00:18:59.090
- Is that it?
- Not even close.


188
00:18:59.090 --> 00:19:01.070
We decided to bury
the dog in the forest

189
00:19:01.070 --> 00:19:02.690
and then just sort of forgot about it.

190
00:19:02.690 --> 00:19:05.240
And we started down the
path and immediately


191
00:19:05.240 --> 00:19:08.390
I felt something was wrong,
like something was following us.


192
00:19:08.390 --> 00:19:11.030
Suddenly, I turn around and
there's that young Scotty dog


193
00:19:11.030 --> 00:19:12.287
running up towards us.
- Oh my God.


194
00:19:12.287 --> 00:19:15.350
And that's when I noticed,

195
00:19:15.350 --> 00:19:17.240
one blue and one green eye

196
00:19:17.240 --> 00:19:19.160
and it smelled like the lake.

197
00:19:22.933 --> 00:19:25.043
Huh, to this day, when I'm alone, I,

198
00:19:26.080 --> 00:19:28.087
I think maybe I'm not,

199
00:19:28.087 --> 00:19:30.770
then I imagine it's that one dead dog

200
00:19:30.770 --> 00:19:33.623
with one blue and one green eye.

201
00:19:36.886 --> 00:19:40.670
- Hmm.

202
00:19:40.670 --> 00:19:42.533
- Weird.
- Yeah.


203
00:19:45.546 --> 00:19:47.480
Okay. Your turn.

204
00:19:47.480 --> 00:19:49.843
What about this house scares you?

205
00:19:49.843 --> 00:19:54.140
- Oh, no, no, um, my thing
isn't nearly as scary as yours.


206
00:19:54.140 --> 00:19:56.507
You're just, you're
just gonna laugh at me.


207
00:19:56.507 --> 00:19:58.670
- Oh, no, I promise I won't.

208
00:19:58.670 --> 00:20:01.043
Scout's honor. Come on.

209
00:20:03.380 --> 00:20:08.380
- Okay, well, it all started
when I was really little


210
00:20:08.780 --> 00:20:11.360
and my cousins would tease me mercilessly

211
00:20:11.360 --> 00:20:16.250
about the Boogeyman.

212
00:20:19.423 --> 00:20:21.233
He said he lived in my closet,

213
00:20:22.889 --> 00:20:26.510
and he teased that they
could hear him breathing


214
00:20:26.510 --> 00:20:28.731
from the other side of the door.

215
00:20:34.370 --> 00:20:39.370
Sometimes now I wake up
in the dead of night.


216
00:20:39.530 --> 00:20:43.610
I swear I can hear something

217
00:20:43.610 --> 00:20:46.613
or someone breathing in my closet.

218
00:20:49.220 --> 00:20:54.220
And that's why I don't
wanna sleep alone tonight.


219
00:20:58.969 --> 00:21:01.552
- Your, ah, your room upstairs?

220
00:21:02.900 --> 00:21:03.733
- Yeah?

221
00:21:05.870 --> 00:21:08.120
- Well what exactly do
I get if I take care


222
00:21:08.120 --> 00:21:10.283
of this little Boogeyman problem for you?

223
00:21:12.230 --> 00:21:13.734
- What do you mean?

224
00:21:13.734 --> 00:21:16.373
- I mean, if
I go kick his ass,

225
00:21:17.810 --> 00:21:19.210
you have to plant one on me.

226
00:21:20.990 --> 00:21:21.823
- Deal.

227
00:21:43.172 --> 00:21:44.772
That little closet?

228
00:21:45.800 --> 00:21:46.633
- Yeah.

229
00:21:47.960 --> 00:21:49.310
- You'd think the Boogeyman could afford

230
00:21:49.310 --> 00:21:50.723
a more spacious pad.

231
00:21:51.974 --> 00:21:54.740
Loitering is not allowed

232
00:21:54.740 --> 00:21:56.775
in this house, Mr. Boogeyman.

233
00:21:58.766 --> 00:21:59.916
He must have moved out.

234
00:22:03.222 --> 00:22:06.473
Ha-ha. Very funny, Cathy.

235
00:22:10.880 --> 00:22:15.880
Cathy, are we playing a game?

236
00:22:16.213 --> 00:22:18.299
Cath?

237
00:22:18.299 --> 00:22:19.730
Come on, Cathy.

238
00:22:19.730 --> 00:22:22.552
Open the door. I'm getting
really sick of this.


239
00:22:24.350 --> 00:22:26.690
Cathy, Cathy, come on.

240
00:22:26.690 --> 00:22:28.347
I'm tired of this game.

241
00:22:31.297 --> 00:22:34.142
Cathy, please open the door.

242
00:22:34.142 --> 00:22:36.690
Cathy. Cathy, I'm really tired of this.

243
00:22:36.690 --> 00:22:38.886
You have to let me out now. Please.

244
00:22:38.886 --> 00:22:40.801
Cathy, come on, please.

245
00:22:40.801 --> 00:22:42.260
Cathy, I don't wanna be here her anymore.

246
00:22:42.260 --> 00:22:43.357
Come on. Cathy?

247
00:22:44.840 --> 00:22:46.562
Cathy, it was...

248
00:22:46.562 --> 00:22:50.330
Ah!

249
00:22:56.360 --> 00:22:58.793
God, please!

250
00:23:12.200 --> 00:23:14.240
- When she was eventually admitted,

251
00:23:14.240 --> 00:23:17.060
Cathy couldn't let go of this delusion.

252
00:23:17.060 --> 00:23:20.870
She had convinced herself
that this mutations,


253
00:23:20.870 --> 00:23:24.320
birth mutation of heterochromia
had just allowed her


254
00:23:24.320 --> 00:23:26.750
some psychic connection to this delusion.

255
00:23:26.750 --> 00:23:28.730
- A creature in the closet?

256
00:23:28.730 --> 00:23:30.020
- Childlike as it may be,

257
00:23:30.020 --> 00:23:33.023
it's still a very oddly specific delusion.

258
00:23:34.580 --> 00:23:37.160
- You say her parents
weren't in the picture?


259
00:23:37.160 --> 00:23:39.410
- Do you feel
like it makes a difference?

260
00:23:39.410 --> 00:23:41.450
- Well, yeah. I mean, it's, it's common

261
00:23:41.450 --> 00:23:44.120
when a person experiences
trauma at a young age,


262
00:23:44.120 --> 00:23:46.250
that as a defense
mechanism, they revert back


263
00:23:46.250 --> 00:23:48.380
to a childlike state.

264
00:23:48.380 --> 00:23:51.140
Sometimes it's voice, sometimes behaviors,

265
00:23:51.140 --> 00:23:53.003
sometimes subconsciously.

266
00:23:54.080 --> 00:23:56.870
The closet as a mental set piece

267
00:23:56.870 --> 00:23:59.720
was probably either where she would go

268
00:23:59.720 --> 00:24:04.313
to escape her perpetrator or
where the assault took place.


269
00:24:05.510 --> 00:24:07.610
Ah, maybe, maybe I'm
over-complicating things.


270
00:24:07.610 --> 00:24:09.290
Who wasn't afraid of
something under their bed


271
00:24:09.290 --> 00:24:10.823
or in their closet as a kid?

272
00:24:11.810 --> 00:24:15.143
But my guess is, in Cathy's case,

273
00:24:16.340 --> 00:24:19.313
the Boogeyman was a
living, breathing person.


274
00:24:20.360 --> 00:24:22.160
And her relationship with that person

275
00:24:22.160 --> 00:24:24.589
turned her into a Boogeyman too.

276
00:24:27.530 --> 00:24:30.713
- That was also my
assessment five years ago.


277
00:24:31.940 --> 00:24:34.550
And it was only further
complicated by our next case,


278
00:24:34.550 --> 00:24:35.873
which is Olivia Cushing.

279
00:24:37.476 --> 00:24:40.220
She's our most recent case.

280
00:24:40.220 --> 00:24:44.477
Um, she's also the most
reluctant to talk about it.

I'm not crazy.

00:25:40.403 --> 00:25:43.334
I'm not crazy.

290
00:25:55.692 --> 00:25:56.982
Oh, hi, Mawmaw.

291
00:25:56.982 --> 00:26:00.560
- Hi, sweetie. How's your
first place living alone?


292
00:26:00.560 --> 00:26:02.390
How are you feeling?
- Oh, I mean,


293
00:26:02.390 --> 00:26:04.190
it's been quiet mostly,

294
00:26:04.190 --> 00:26:06.620
and I've felt, 
I've felt better.

295
00:26:06.620 --> 00:26:07.960
I, um...

296
00:26:09.927 --> 00:26:13.070
Well, I'm not feeling
great, but that's okay.


297
00:26:13.070 --> 00:26:15.683
Time heals all wounds or, or whatever.

298
00:26:16.550 --> 00:26:18.624
Well, if
there's anything I can do,


299
00:26:18.624 --> 00:26:20.193
please don't hesitate.

300
00:26:20.193 --> 00:26:24.650
- Aw, I appreciate you, but I'm good.

301
00:26:24.650 --> 00:26:27.320
Um, I've got my paints, so I guess

302
00:26:27.320 --> 00:26:29.750
I've got all the company I need.

303
00:26:29.750 --> 00:26:32.000
Well, your
paints are a poor substitute


304
00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:33.980
for real company.

305
00:26:33.980 --> 00:26:38.321
Have you been out? Any new young
men you've got your eye on?


306
00:26:38.321 --> 00:26:41.720
Ah, dating is the last thing

307
00:26:41.720 --> 00:26:43.850
I wanna think about right now.

308
00:26:43.850 --> 00:26:46.180
- Well, I just wanted to check in

309
00:26:46.180 --> 00:26:48.050
on my favorite granddaughter.

310
00:26:48.050 --> 00:26:51.904
- I'm your only granddaughter, Mawmaw.

311
00:26:51.904 --> 00:26:53.840
And you're still my favorite.

312
00:26:53.840 --> 00:26:55.783
- Oh, well, thank you.

313
00:26:55.783 --> 00:26:59.300
Ah, I love you so much.

314
00:26:59.300 --> 00:27:00.850
Don't be a stranger.

315
00:27:02.270 --> 00:27:06.840
- All righty. Well, I'll
talk to you soon, Mawmaw.


316
00:27:06.840 --> 00:27:07.977
Okay? Bye-bye.

317
00:28:19.076 --> 00:28:21.259
Hey, honey, that's not why

318
00:28:21.259 --> 00:28:22.996
I'm telling you this.

319
00:28:22.996 --> 00:28:25.187
Well, let's just please...

320
00:28:25.187 --> 00:28:26.770
Nice.

321
00:28:28.068 --> 00:28:31.382
Yes,
well, I know.


322
00:28:31.382 --> 00:28:33.945
But that shit with her is fucking crazy.

323
00:28:35.841 --> 00:28:38.903
Oh.

324
00:28:38.903 --> 00:28:41.150
Okay.
- Cass, I'm being serious.


325
00:28:41.150 --> 00:28:43.857
I'm not staying inside this
house with that bat in there.


326
00:28:43.857 --> 00:28:46.607
Oh.

327
00:28:50.768 --> 00:28:51.601
Oh, shit.

328
00:28:53.776 --> 00:28:55.089
All right,

329
00:28:55.089 --> 00:28:56.686
let's see what's up.

330
00:28:59.810 --> 00:29:00.980
Okay.

331
00:29:00.980 --> 00:29:05.750
"Feeling and being sick
or feeling very sleepy,


332
00:29:05.750 --> 00:29:10.750
headaches, loss of
libido, reduced sex drive,


333
00:29:12.140 --> 00:29:14.810
difficulties achieving, achieving orgasm

334
00:29:14.810 --> 00:29:17.207
during sex or masturbation."

335
00:29:18.279 --> 00:29:22.341
Huh.

336
00:29:22.341 --> 00:29:27.341
Well, before it's too late.

337
00:30:01.134 --> 00:30:02.683
No, no.

338
00:30:02.683 --> 00:30:05.386
- Come and see. Come and see.

339
00:31:56.829 --> 00:31:58.104
- Come and see. Come and see.

340
00:31:58.104 --> 00:31:59.246
Come and see. Come and see.

341
00:32:49.826 --> 00:32:51.409
- What? I didn't...

342
00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:05.840
Oh Jesus.

343
00:33:05.840 --> 00:33:08.766
They were not fucking around
about those side effects.


344
00:34:23.540 --> 00:34:24.707
What the fuck?

345
00:34:41.415 --> 00:34:42.863
What the fuck were you thinking?

346
00:34:42.863 --> 00:34:45.410
- No. You're coming in a little hot.

347
00:34:45.410 --> 00:34:48.020
- No shit, Sherlock. 
I'm tired of this.

348
00:34:48.020 --> 00:34:50.090
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

349
00:34:50.090 --> 00:34:51.649
- Seriously, Chad.

350
00:34:51.649 --> 00:34:54.229
And I'm being very serious right now.

351
00:34:54.229 --> 00:34:56.030
Did you come over here last night?

352
00:34:56.030 --> 00:34:57.800
- Um, not that I recall.

353
00:34:57.800 --> 00:34:59.630
- I'm not fucking around.

354
00:34:59.630 --> 00:35:01.970
- Look, Olivia, the only
reason I'm even having to talk


355
00:35:01.970 --> 00:35:04.280
to you right now is because
you still owe me 200 bucks


356
00:35:04.280 --> 00:35:05.960
for those Feeding Fingers tickets.

357
00:35:05.960 --> 00:35:09.717
- Chad, I swear to God.

358
00:35:09.717 --> 00:35:12.380
- $200, Olivia, 200.

359
00:35:12.380 --> 00:35:16.670
- Look, this has been a
brilliant conversation and all.


360
00:35:16.670 --> 00:35:20.540
All I'm trying to say is
stay the fuck away from me


361
00:35:20.540 --> 00:35:22.430
and my new place, okay?

362
00:35:22.430 --> 00:35:23.513
- Ah, sure.

363
00:35:24.590 --> 00:35:26.330
- Yeah, I should have listened to Michelle

364
00:35:26.330 --> 00:35:29.000
when she told me you were
fucking around on me.


365
00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:30.740
- I thought you were done.

366
00:35:30.740 --> 00:35:32.450
- Go play in traffic, dick.

367
00:35:32.450 --> 00:35:37.259
And also, fuck your
tickets and fuck your $200!


368
00:35:37.259 --> 00:35:40.516

391
00:38:44.960 --> 00:38:48.078
I'm not, I'm not crazy. 
I'm not crazy.

392
00:38:48.078 --> 00:38:51.646
I don't, I, I'm not, 
I'm not crazy.

393
00:38:51.646 --> 00:38:54.177
I'm not crazy. 
I've made it this far.

394
00:38:54.177 --> 00:38:56.708
I've made it this far.

395
00:40:00.836 --> 00:40:03.950
- Poor girl's grandmother
is the one who found her


396
00:40:03.950 --> 00:40:05.870
almost catatonic.

397
00:40:05.870 --> 00:40:08.616
Medical reports suggest
she hadn't eaten in days.


398
00:40:11.630 --> 00:40:14.063
- Huh. There it is.

399
00:40:15.080 --> 00:40:16.823
How did I not see this coming?

400
00:40:18.080 --> 00:40:20.030
- Okay. You've got my attention.

401
00:40:20.030 --> 00:40:21.380
- The connection.

402
00:40:21.380 --> 00:40:25.610
Both women have a history of
abusive relationships with men.


403
00:40:25.610 --> 00:40:29.513
Assuredly, a history of
undiagnosed PTSD for said trauma.


404
00:40:33.200 --> 00:40:36.140
They're struggling with feeling powerless

405
00:40:36.140 --> 00:40:37.673
and finding their power.

406
00:40:39.110 --> 00:40:41.510
- So you're saying that their ability,

407
00:40:41.510 --> 00:40:46.510
sorry, lack of ability to cope
is what makes them go crazy?


408
00:40:47.780 --> 00:40:50.270
I think we're too far
advanced to start blaming


409
00:40:50.270 --> 00:40:52.700
female hysteria, don't you, Dr. Makenzie?

410
00:40:52.700 --> 00:40:54.560
- That's not what I was implying.

411
00:40:54.560 --> 00:40:57.290
- Well, before you go too
far down that rabbit hole,


412
00:40:57.290 --> 00:40:59.030
I do wanna let you know
that the female cases


413
00:40:59.030 --> 00:41:00.830
are the outliers.

414
00:41:00.830 --> 00:41:05.757
The delusion is more
drastic with the male.


415
00:41:10.610 --> 00:41:13.280
- Now you're just trying to
lead me down the wrong path.


416
00:41:13.280 --> 00:41:15.440
- Mm, no, I'm
just trying to give you

417
00:41:15.440 --> 00:41:17.300
all of the data points, even the ones

418
00:41:17.300 --> 00:41:19.163
that don't align with the statistics.

419
00:41:21.380 --> 00:41:25.253
Schizophrenia and criminality
have a strange relationship,


420
00:41:26.870 --> 00:41:28.403
especially with Tommy Butler.

421
00:41:35.030 --> 00:41:36.830
Patient 053.

422
00:41:36.830 --> 00:41:40.910
Schizophrenia and criminality
have a strange relationship,


423
00:41:40.910 --> 00:41:42.593
especially for Tommy Butler.

424
00:41:44.750 --> 00:41:45.850
- We're brothers, man.

425
00:41:48.589 --> 00:41:51.290
I love you, man.

426
00:41:51.290 --> 00:41:54.590
- Tommy, hey.
- What's up?


427
00:41:54.590 --> 00:41:57.980
- I lost you there
for a second. You good?

428
00:41:59.967 --> 00:42:00.800
- No.

429
00:42:02.726 --> 00:42:04.309
- Yeah. Me neither.

430
00:42:11.388 --> 00:42:13.479
Look, we should go get the, ah...

431
00:42:13.479 --> 00:42:14.312
- Yeah.

432
00:42:44.063 --> 00:42:44.896
Whoa.

433
00:43:14.930 --> 00:43:17.720
- It's been a long time since
we've been to dad's house.


434
00:43:17.720 --> 00:43:19.570
Could be sweet if you think about it.

435
00:43:22.310 --> 00:43:23.513
- Sweet, yeah.

436
00:43:27.320 --> 00:43:28.820
Dad would've been proud of us.

437
00:43:31.730 --> 00:43:33.880
If he was alive, he
could've helped us dig.


438
00:43:35.150 --> 00:43:37.340
- Like Mom would've
let us dump a body

439
00:43:37.340 --> 00:43:38.963
in her communal trash zone.

440
00:43:42.590 --> 00:43:45.407
- No, you're right. 
This is the thing.

441
00:43:45.407 --> 00:43:46.757
This is what we have to do.

442
00:43:49.168 --> 00:43:50.655
I know we have to.

443
00:44:20.407 --> 00:44:25.407
Mm.

444
00:44:32.180 --> 00:44:33.013
- All right.

445
00:44:35.295 --> 00:44:37.670
Yeah.

446
00:44:37.670 --> 00:44:39.740
- I'm gonna, ah, go take the car

447
00:44:39.740 --> 00:44:41.480
back down the path, walk back up.

448
00:44:41.480 --> 00:44:44.270
- You think they saw our car?
- No, just doesn't hurt.


449
00:44:44.270 --> 00:44:48.710
You know, like, um, it's a little hike.

450
00:44:48.710 --> 00:44:49.543
- Sure.

451
00:44:52.130 --> 00:44:54.383
- You need anything? 
Drink, smokes?

452
00:44:56.420 --> 00:44:57.980
- No, I still have my pack somewhere.

453
00:44:57.980 --> 00:44:58.843
- Okay, cool.

454
00:45:00.197 --> 00:45:01.851
I'll be right back.

455
00:45:10.450 --> 00:45:11.367
- Ah, fuck.

456
00:45:25.810 --> 00:45:27.031
Mm.

457
00:46:54.980 --> 00:46:57.653
- Hey. Yeah, no, it's good.

458
00:46:59.120 --> 00:47:01.550
Ah, no, I think
we're gonna have to wait

459
00:47:01.550 --> 00:47:03.000
around here for a little bit.

460
00:47:04.070 --> 00:47:05.863
Yeah, well, there's nobody from miles

461
00:47:05.863 --> 00:47:07.363
once you get to the house, so.

462
00:47:09.189 --> 00:47:11.514
Okay, yeah. I'll let you know.

463
00:47:13.959 --> 00:47:14.792
Fuck.

464
00:47:33.390 --> 00:47:34.223
- Fuck.

465
00:48:51.291 --> 00:48:54.257
I know what you did, Tommy.

466
00:48:59.797 --> 00:49:00.630
- Hey.

467
00:49:02.810 --> 00:49:05.093
Hey, Tom.

468
00:49:08.960 --> 00:49:09.793
- Nothing.

469
00:49:12.200 --> 00:49:14.780
Found dad's old radio.
- Oh, yeah. .


470
00:49:14.780 --> 00:49:16.850
- You fucking loved that thing. That's it.

471
00:49:16.850 --> 00:49:18.530
- Ah, it doesn't work.

472
00:49:18.530 --> 00:49:20.300
- Yeah, I bet there's
batteries around here somewhere


473
00:49:20.300 --> 00:49:22.873
or a cord or something.
- It doesn't work.


474
00:49:22.873 --> 00:49:25.673
- Okay, all right. Wanna beer?

475
00:49:28.760 --> 00:49:33.760
Cool. Hey, man, we're
gonna be safe here, okay?


476
00:49:34.730 --> 00:49:37.220
And let things die
down a bit, you know,

477
00:49:37.220 --> 00:49:38.720
ease our way back into society,

478
00:49:38.720 --> 00:49:40.320
cover our tracks, all that shit.

479
00:49:42.680 --> 00:49:45.140
I've been talking to this, ah-
- Give me your phone.


480
00:49:45.140 --> 00:49:46.940
- What?
- Just in case


481
00:49:46.940 --> 00:49:49.460
they can track it,
you know, like I don't,

482
00:49:49.460 --> 00:49:51.740
I don't know, just give me your phone.

483
00:49:51.740 --> 00:49:53.030
I'll put it in the cabinet with mine

484
00:49:53.030 --> 00:49:54.922
and we can check it at
the end of the week.


485
00:49:54.922 --> 00:49:57.113
- Okay, if it
will make you feel better.

486
00:50:17.422 --> 00:50:18.255
Okay.

487
00:50:21.740 --> 00:50:22.573
You want dinner?

488
00:50:23.900 --> 00:50:24.733
- Sure.

489
00:50:38.900 --> 00:50:41.323
I'm gonna go into town tomorrow.
Get some more groceries.


490
00:50:42.590 --> 00:50:43.423
- Way cool.

491
00:50:44.570 --> 00:50:46.490
- You gonna do anything fun?

492
00:50:46.490 --> 00:50:49.763
- Oh yeah. Let me plan
my weekend real quick.


493
00:50:52.010 --> 00:50:56.180
I can't leave here, so, no.

494
00:50:56.180 --> 00:50:57.083
- Nobody saw you.

495
00:50:58.212 --> 00:51:00.006
- I know one guy did.

496
00:51:07.550 --> 00:51:11.750
There's nothing here, just dust

497
00:51:11.750 --> 00:51:16.750
and fucking, I don't
know, shower curtains.


498
00:51:16.850 --> 00:51:17.983
Dad's old porn.
- Hey,


499
00:51:17.983 --> 00:51:19.373
some of it's pretty good.

500
00:51:20.570 --> 00:51:21.470
- Only one of 'em.

501
00:51:26.240 --> 00:51:27.073
- Shit.
- What?


502
00:51:28.490 --> 00:51:30.582
- You know it might still be here.

503
00:51:30.582 --> 00:51:34.960
- No.
- I'll be right back.


504
00:51:43.645 --> 00:51:44.728
Jesus Christ.

505
00:51:49.401 --> 00:51:50.234
Oh, fuck.

506
00:51:52.137 --> 00:51:55.887
Ah, fuck, dad.

507
00:52:16.147 --> 00:52:18.203
- Ethan, what the fuck are you doing?

508
00:52:21.320 --> 00:52:22.600
- Oh, ho, ho, ho.

509
00:52:22.600 --> 00:52:26.187
Ah.

510
00:52:28.490 --> 00:52:29.640
- I can't see anything.

511
00:52:31.829 --> 00:52:33.579
Damn, locks, windows.

512
00:52:35.600 --> 00:52:36.433
Fuck!

513
00:52:41.090 --> 00:52:43.280
- Yep. Still here.

514
00:52:47.673 --> 00:52:48.756
- What is it?

515
00:52:50.391 --> 00:52:54.132
Hmm?

516
00:53:24.693 --> 00:53:26.090
- All right, I'll take a,

517
00:53:26.090 --> 00:53:28.789
I'll take a big
fat fart on your face.

518
00:53:28.789 --> 00:53:31.906
Shit. Come out to play.

519
00:53:31.906 --> 00:53:34.087
- Okay, what are talking about?

520
00:53:34.087 --> 00:53:37.199
Oh, God! Ah, your head exploded.

521
00:53:37.199 --> 00:53:38.282
Give me it, fucking take

522
00:53:38.282 --> 00:53:39.219
your medicine!
- No, I'm not taking it.


523
00:53:39.219 --> 00:53:40.276
- Take your medicine.
- Take your fucking...


524
00:53:40.276 --> 00:53:42.817
- Take your medicine.
- Oh, Jesus Christ.


525
00:53:42.817 --> 00:53:44.150
- Yes!
- I let you win that one.


526
00:53:44.150 --> 00:53:44.983
- You didn't let me win that one.

527
00:53:44.983 --> 00:53:46.280
- Yeah.
- Fucking be better.


528
00:53:46.280 --> 00:53:47.870
- Yeah, well, when you were playing Halo,

529
00:53:47.870 --> 00:53:49.800
I was getting laid.
- Oh.


530
00:53:49.800 --> 00:53:51.170
- No, I won't let you take it.
- Fuck you then.


531
00:53:51.170 --> 00:53:52.497
Fuck you, this mine now.

532
00:53:53.646 --> 00:53:55.177
- Oh, fuck.
- Mm.


533
00:53:55.177 --> 00:53:56.795
Oh, you backwashed in that shit.

534
00:53:56.795 --> 00:53:58.058
- Uh-oh.
- Ooh!


535
00:53:58.058 --> 00:54:00.848
- Oh!
- Fuck you!


536
00:54:00.848 --> 00:54:02.062
- Fuck you!
- Fuck you!


537
00:54:02.062 --> 00:54:03.480
- No, fuck you!
- Fuck you!


538
00:54:03.480 --> 00:54:05.032
Fuck you, fuck you!

539
00:54:05.032 --> 00:54:06.115
Ah!

540
00:54:22.263 --> 00:54:26.013
Tommy?

541
00:54:27.002 --> 00:54:29.059
I know what you did, Tommy.

542
00:54:31.876 --> 00:54:35.191
Come closer, Tommy. It's okay.

543
00:54:48.950 --> 00:54:49.867
Go outside.

544
00:54:52.923 --> 00:54:54.256
- What the fuck?

545
00:55:38.510 --> 00:55:39.893
- What are you doing?

546
00:55:40.880 --> 00:55:43.100
Trying to make this thing work.

547
00:55:43.100 --> 00:55:44.423
- Well shit, let me see.

548
00:55:45.710 --> 00:55:47.540
Oh, yeah. No way.

549
00:55:47.540 --> 00:55:49.490
- Yeah, it's caked.
- Yeah.


550
00:55:49.490 --> 00:55:51.833
That thing is not turning on anytime soon.

551
00:55:52.730 --> 00:55:54.170
But anybody who faces these things

552
00:55:54.170 --> 00:55:56.570
is probably already
dead, right?


553
00:55:56.570 --> 00:55:59.030
- I heard something out
of it yesterday though.


554
00:55:59.030 --> 00:55:59.870
- I thought you said it didn't work.

555
00:55:59.870 --> 00:56:02.543
- Yeah, I don't know.
- Right.


556
00:56:03.800 --> 00:56:05.600
Well, hey, I'm gonna go to
the store, get some real food.


557
00:56:05.600 --> 00:56:07.460
You want anything specific?

558
00:56:07.460 --> 00:56:09.133
- Chips.
- Yeah, yeah.


559
00:56:12.920 --> 00:56:14.454
- Ethan.
- Yeah, man?


560
00:56:19.430 --> 00:56:20.543
- We did a bad thing.

561
00:56:24.341 --> 00:56:25.700
- Yeah, man. I know.

562
00:56:25.700 --> 00:56:28.703
- We did a bad thing. We're
gonna get in trouble for it.


563
00:56:29.810 --> 00:56:34.070
- Tommy, we're gonna be okay.

564
00:56:34.070 --> 00:56:35.600
I'm serious. All right?

565
00:56:35.600 --> 00:56:38.870
We just gotta wait this thing
out. Let it run its course.


566
00:56:38.870 --> 00:56:40.670
You're okay.
- No, it doesn't matter.


567
00:56:40.670 --> 00:56:43.070
- What do you mean?
- We did something bad.


568
00:56:43.070 --> 00:56:45.560
We took something and now the
only way you can fix it is,


569
00:56:45.560 --> 00:56:47.450
is by giving something up.

570
00:56:47.450 --> 00:56:49.880
- What are you talking about?
Nobody is coming for us.


571
00:56:49.880 --> 00:56:51.590
- Yeah, they, that's what
I'm trying to tell you.


572
00:56:51.590 --> 00:56:53.240
- I'm not gonna
let you turn yourself in,

573
00:56:53.240 --> 00:56:54.770
and I'm not gonna turn myself in

574
00:56:54.770 --> 00:56:56.120
because either way, I'm fucked.

575
00:56:56.120 --> 00:56:57.440
- No, just fucking listen.
- I'm not going to jail


576
00:56:57.440 --> 00:56:59.213
because you fucking killed someone!

577
00:57:01.220 --> 00:57:02.370
I'm going to the store.

578
00:57:06.110 --> 00:57:07.130
And I'm taking these!

579
00:57:07.130 --> 00:57:09.490
Don't do anything fucking
stupid while I'm gone.


580
00:57:09.490 --> 00:57:14.107
Fuck.

581
00:57:16.162 --> 00:57:18.995
Fuck!

582
00:57:30.205 --> 00:57:31.038
Bullshit.

583
00:57:32.683 --> 00:57:33.850
It's bullshit.

584
00:57:36.580 --> 00:57:37.413
Piss off

585
00:57:39.037 --> 00:57:41.458
bitches.

586
00:58:43.152 --> 00:58:45.231
Tommy did a bad thing

587
00:58:45.231 --> 00:58:49.279
and now something is
coming for him.


588
00:58:49.279 --> 00:58:52.879
There's only one way to
make this right.


589
00:58:52.879 --> 00:58:55.636
You know what to do.

590
00:58:55.636 --> 00:58:57.222
- Giver must taketh.

591
00:59:18.380 --> 00:59:20.933
- Yeah, no, that's good.
Yeah, that's good news.


592
00:59:22.520 --> 00:59:24.470
Ah, I think in a couple
of days we should have Tom


593
00:59:24.470 --> 00:59:27.470
go get groceries, and then
maybe in a couple of weeks


594
00:59:27.470 --> 00:59:28.520
we'll get outta here.

595
00:59:30.208 --> 00:59:33.393
Ah, I think he's just starting
to be a little cooped up,


596
00:59:34.610 --> 00:59:37.630
thinking he might, ah, turn
himself in, I don't know.


597
00:59:39.860 --> 00:59:42.830
Look, give it to me straight here.

598
00:59:42.830 --> 00:59:45.683
What, what happens if
everything goes wrong?


599
00:59:46.981 --> 00:59:48.585
Fuck!

600
00:59:48.585 --> 00:59:50.991
Fuck!

601
00:59:53.385 --> 00:59:54.218
Mm! No.

602
00:59:55.718 --> 00:59:57.996
No!

603
01:00:04.850 --> 01:00:07.003
Fuck!

604
01:00:16.340 --> 01:00:19.117
- No, I don't
think he'd do it again.

605
01:00:22.619 --> 01:00:23.702
- Okay, yeah.

606
01:00:42.864 --> 01:00:43.697
- Okay.

607
01:00:46.579 --> 01:00:47.467
Hey, Tommy.

608
01:00:51.417 --> 01:00:52.717
What are you doing, buddy?

609
01:00:57.388 --> 01:00:59.138
- We did a bad thing.

610
01:01:00.080 --> 01:01:02.150
- Yeah, I know
we did a bad thing,

611
01:01:02.150 --> 01:01:04.283
but let's put the gun away, okay?

612
01:01:05.120 --> 01:01:06.870
I got a beer. You want some beers?

613
01:01:13.220 --> 01:01:14.303
- We killed someone.

614
01:01:17.672 --> 01:01:22.672
I killed someone
and it's not okay.


615
01:01:23.420 --> 01:01:25.700
I'm not, I'm not okay. 
Nothing's okay.

616
01:01:25.700 --> 01:01:27.050
- No, it's gonna be okay.
- Mm-mm.


617
01:01:27.050 --> 01:01:28.520
- Yeah, it's gonna be okay
because I've been talking


618
01:01:28.520 --> 01:01:30.080
to a friend of mine, he's-
- You've been talking?


619
01:01:30.080 --> 01:01:31.400
Who have you been talking to?
- Rich, oh, Jesus, Tommy!


620
01:01:31.400 --> 01:01:33.260
- Who you've been talking to?

621
01:01:33.260 --> 01:01:34.400
Something's been talking to me.

622
01:01:34.400 --> 01:01:36.350
Something has been talking to me

623
01:01:36.350 --> 01:01:38.030
through the fucking radio.

624
01:01:38.030 --> 01:01:40.370
And now it's out there and
it's just standing out there.


625
01:01:40.370 --> 01:01:41.687
It's watching me! 
It's judging me!

626
01:01:41.687 --> 01:01:44.150
- No.
- It's fucking out there!


627
01:01:44.150 --> 01:01:46.816
And it want, it wants me to...

628
01:01:50.180 --> 01:01:51.053
It wants me to.

629
01:01:52.940 --> 01:01:53.960
- Tommy.
- No, no, no, no.


630
01:01:53.960 --> 01:01:56.390
I, I have to.
- Tommy, you're okay.


631
01:01:56.390 --> 01:01:58.040
This is some scary shit, right?

632
01:01:58.040 --> 01:01:59.840
We're out in the middle
of the fucking woods,


633
01:01:59.840 --> 01:02:01.103
but we are safe.

634
01:02:04.850 --> 01:02:07.190
Okay? We got food, we got wa...

635
01:02:07.190 --> 01:02:10.373
We have got each other.
There's nothing out there.


636
01:02:11.390 --> 01:02:13.850
Nobody's talking to you
through a fucking broken radio.


637
01:02:13.850 --> 01:02:16.973
There's no Boogeyman. 
It's me and you.

638
01:02:19.400 --> 01:02:21.413
We're brothers. Okay?

639
01:02:23.030 --> 01:02:25.043
And I've always got your fucking back.

640
01:02:28.189 --> 01:02:30.833
I love you, Tommy.

641
01:02:35.922 --> 01:02:37.339
- I love you too.

642
01:02:43.429 --> 01:02:45.707
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Come on.

643
01:02:45.707 --> 01:02:46.540
It's okay.

644
01:02:55.943 --> 01:02:56.776
Okay.

645
01:02:59.523 --> 01:03:01.623
You're okay, buddy.

646
01:03:04.367 --> 01:03:06.287
Okay, you've been cooped
up here too long. Okay?


647
01:03:06.287 --> 01:03:07.820
- Mm-hmm.

648
01:03:07.820 --> 01:03:09.255
- Let's get outta here, okay?

649
01:03:09.255 --> 01:03:11.300
- Okay, yeah.
- All right?


650
01:03:11.300 --> 01:03:13.340
Let's go to one of those shady
dive bars down by the river.


651
01:03:13.340 --> 01:03:15.499
Okay?
- Mm-hmm, okay.


652
01:03:15.499 --> 01:03:17.216
Yeah.
- Okay.


653
01:03:29.300 --> 01:03:32.501
- No, fuck no. Ethan, lock
the fucking doors, Ethan!


654
01:03:38.930 --> 01:03:39.763
- Tommy?

655
01:03:45.210 --> 01:03:46.043
- Fuck.

656
01:03:56.222 --> 01:03:57.805
Fuck, no! Get back!

657
01:04:04.448 --> 01:04:05.281
Fuck!

658
01:04:21.140 --> 01:04:23.362
Come on. No, no, no, no, no, no.

659
01:04:23.362 --> 01:04:24.445
Ethan. Ethan.

660
01:04:46.700 --> 01:04:48.710
Tommy turned himself in.

661
01:04:48.710 --> 01:04:51.510
He just appeared in front of
the gas station with Ethan.


662
01:04:52.490 --> 01:04:55.670
I have to assume that he
dragged his brother's body


663
01:04:55.670 --> 01:04:57.680
all the way there.

664
01:04:57.680 --> 01:05:00.770
He told the police all about the murder,

665
01:05:00.770 --> 01:05:04.460
but refused to claim his
brother's death as his own.


666
01:05:04.460 --> 01:05:06.770
- Was it your staff who
performed his psych eval?


667
01:05:06.770 --> 01:05:10.684
- Hmm. I don't think I like
what you're insinuating.


668
01:05:10.684 --> 01:05:13.340
Look, I'm not
trying to overstep here.


669
01:05:13.340 --> 01:05:17.090
I, ah, you are hiring me
as a resident psychiatrist.


670
01:05:17.090 --> 01:05:19.640
Are you not?
Dr. Makenzie,


671
01:05:19.640 --> 01:05:21.980
I am all for discussion.

672
01:05:21.980 --> 01:05:23.660
Really, it's the only way that a group

673
01:05:23.660 --> 01:05:26.210
of people can actually progress.

674
01:05:26.210 --> 01:05:28.940
I just hope that you give me
and my staff enough respect


675
01:05:28.940 --> 01:05:31.550
to come out and say what you're thinking

676
01:05:31.550 --> 01:05:33.440
instead of hiding behind a question.

677
01:05:33.440 --> 01:05:35.990
- Well, it just seems obvious to me.

678
01:05:35.990 --> 01:05:39.203
People claim insanity to avoid jail time.

679
01:05:40.100 --> 01:05:41.930
It would be in Tommy's best interest

680
01:05:41.930 --> 01:05:44.030
to be deemed clinically insane,

681
01:05:44.030 --> 01:05:47.213
especially if he's facing
execution for his crimes.


682
01:05:48.140 --> 01:05:50.700
- And those who think it's
in their best interest


683
01:05:51.740 --> 01:05:54.290
in order to stay in an insane asylum

684
01:05:54.290 --> 01:05:57.350
are insultingly easy to catch.

685
01:05:57.350 --> 01:05:59.240
- No, I suppose
I'll have to meet him

686
01:05:59.240 --> 01:06:02.240
and make my own observations.

687
01:06:02.240 --> 01:06:05.033
- That's fair enough. 
I understand that.

688
01:06:06.320 --> 01:06:08.600
I just hope you came
to a better conclusion


689
01:06:08.600 --> 01:06:10.553
than just that from reading his file.

690
01:06:12.350 --> 01:06:14.663
- Well, they all seem socially inept.

691
01:06:15.620 --> 01:06:18.590
Tendencies of isolation
and lack of true connection


692
01:06:18.590 --> 01:06:20.603
can lead a mind many places.

693
01:06:21.800 --> 01:06:24.050
- Tommy seemed pretty
reliant on his brother.


694
01:06:25.190 --> 01:06:27.233
- Yes, but not before.

695
01:06:29.330 --> 01:06:32.960
What I mean to say is they
weren't in as much direct contact


696
01:06:32.960 --> 01:06:36.503
until after the bank robbery
and Tommy committed the murder.


697
01:06:37.400 --> 01:06:40.541
This leads me to believe
it's a slow build.


698
01:06:40.541 --> 01:06:44.603
- Hmm. It's interesting
to think of history.


699
01:06:45.727 --> 01:06:48.980
You know, a two-year-old can
hear their mom slam a door


700
01:06:48.980 --> 01:06:52.010
and it flips a switch in their mind.

701
01:06:52.010 --> 01:06:54.200
- Well you are a doctor.

702
01:06:54.200 --> 01:06:56.450
I'm sure you've heard of Freud.

703
01:06:56.450 --> 01:06:57.503
- I have, thank you.

704
01:06:59.930 --> 01:07:02.480
You know what's interesting about history

705
01:07:02.480 --> 01:07:05.210
or what's more interesting about history,

706
01:07:05.210 --> 01:07:08.723
is when it doesn't align with
the stereotypical outcome.


707
01:07:10.070 --> 01:07:12.290
- Now it's your turn to explain.

708
01:07:12.290 --> 01:07:13.880
- I don't need
to explain what I thought,

709
01:07:13.880 --> 01:07:15.290
my thoughts on this.

710
01:07:15.290 --> 01:07:17.368
What do you think makes someone snap?

711
01:07:20.900 --> 01:07:23.993
- Um, a break from their normalcy,

712
01:07:25.220 --> 01:07:29.210
ah, severance in the line
that is there one-way roadmap.


713
01:07:29.210 --> 01:07:31.043
Not to sound too philosophical.

714
01:07:33.620 --> 01:07:38.120
I don't know. I guess I
would need more information.


715
01:07:38.120 --> 01:07:40.320
I would need to see
what's being overlooked.


716
01:07:48.470 --> 01:07:49.507
- John Conroy.

717
01:07:53.259 --> 01:07:57.342
He, he was a sin...

718
01:07:58.903 --> 01:08:02.604
He was a sinner.

719
01:08:02.604 --> 01:08:05.021
He was a sinner. I proved it.

720
01:08:06.042 --> 01:08:08.202
I proved it.

721
01:08:51.437 --> 01:08:52.343
- You John?

722
01:08:54.530 --> 01:08:57.389
- In the flesh. You Joyless
Division 95, I presume


723
01:08:59.480 --> 01:09:01.233
- It's Rose and yeah.

724
01:09:09.500 --> 01:09:12.740
- So you said in the ad that
you've never done this before.


725
01:09:12.740 --> 01:09:15.170
Oh, I definitely haven't.

726
01:09:15.170 --> 01:09:17.540
- Well, it's no big deal.
I, I can show you the ropes.


727
01:09:17.540 --> 01:09:19.253
A firm believer is all I need.

728
01:09:21.200 --> 01:09:23.420
- Um, well, I don't really like believe

729
01:09:23.420 --> 01:09:25.430
in the supernatural or
anything, so.


730
01:09:25.430 --> 01:09:27.030
- Why did you take the job then?

731
01:09:28.206 --> 01:09:30.920
- Well, I don't know.
I've always wanted to act.


732
01:09:30.920 --> 01:09:33.620
And 140 bucks is 140 bucks.

733
01:09:33.620 --> 01:09:35.629
- What we're doing is not acting.

734
01:09:35.629 --> 01:09:38.480
- Okay, look, I've
binged a ton of these

735
01:09:38.480 --> 01:09:40.219
ghost hunting shows, and they're all

736
01:09:40.219 --> 01:09:43.076
the same overdramatized bullshit, okay?

737
01:09:43.076 --> 01:09:45.650
"Ooh, I'm cold. 
It must be a ghost."

738
01:09:45.650 --> 01:09:49.370
With that logic, I must
have a haunted freezer


739
01:09:49.370 --> 01:09:51.889
in my apartment.
- We're not hunting ghosts.


740
01:09:51.889 --> 01:09:55.190
I mean, did you even
read the help wanted ad?


741
01:09:55.190 --> 01:09:58.049
Um, ah, maybe this
isn't a good fit for me.


742
01:09:58.049 --> 01:10:00.830
- What? No, dude, I already
drove all the way out here.


743
01:10:00.830 --> 01:10:02.930
Look, okay, you need my help.

744
01:10:02.930 --> 01:10:05.575
And plus, maybe you can convince me.

745
01:10:05.575 --> 01:10:08.840
Ah, . Fine.

746
01:10:08.840 --> 01:10:11.510
Just hop in the car. We've
got along drive ahead of us.


747
01:10:11.510 --> 01:10:12.343
Fuck.

748
01:10:15.590 --> 01:10:16.423
- Yay.

749
01:11:05.120 --> 01:11:07.879
Oh, hey, is this a camera bag?
- Don't touch that.


750
01:11:07.879 --> 01:11:09.920
- Oh, wait, is this thing on?
- That's what


751
01:11:09.920 --> 01:11:10.920
the red light means.

752
01:11:12.227 --> 01:11:15.440
- Oh, oh yeah, it is on.

753
01:11:15.440 --> 01:11:16.760
Okay, cool. Um,

754
01:11:16.760 --> 01:11:21.260
Okay, so, John, where are we headed?

755
01:11:21.260 --> 01:11:23.180
- We're headed to an abandoned house

756
01:11:23.180 --> 01:11:25.490
in the outskirts of Silverdale.

757
01:11:25.490 --> 01:11:27.470
Wait,
Silverdale? That shithole?


758
01:11:27.470 --> 01:11:30.049
Oh my God, I thought that
ghosts would have finer taste.


759
01:11:30.049 --> 01:11:32.090
- My wife was from Silverdale.

760
01:11:32.090 --> 01:11:35.213
And for the last time,
we're not hunting ghosts.


761
01:11:36.049 --> 01:11:37.730
- Then what the hell are we doing?

762
01:11:37.730 --> 01:11:39.833
- Looking for proof
- Of what?


763
01:11:41.780 --> 01:11:44.040
- A vile, unholy creature

764
01:11:44.959 --> 01:11:47.933
that stalks the night, punishing sinners.

765
01:11:48.770 --> 01:11:50.870
It's known by many names.

766
01:11:50.870 --> 01:11:54.379
The Boggart in England,
the Boobrie in Scotland,


767
01:11:54.379 --> 01:11:59.150
ah, the Babau in Italy and the
De Schwarzer Mann in Germany.


768
01:11:59.150 --> 01:12:04.150
Ah, however, it's most commonly
known to what you hear now


769
01:12:05.150 --> 01:12:07.400
in the states as the Boogeyman.

770
01:12:08.283 --> 01:12:12.170
Sorry. The Boogeyman?

771
01:12:12.170 --> 01:12:14.026
What are you fucking eight years old?

772
01:12:14.026 --> 01:12:15.799
- This isn't, this
isn't the symbol of fear


773
01:12:15.799 --> 01:12:18.560
that your parents used to
scare you into behaving.


774
01:12:18.560 --> 01:12:22.770
It's, malevolence is,
it's beyond comprehension.


775
01:12:22.770 --> 01:12:25.850
I've, I've seen it. I've, I've felt it.

776
01:12:27.995 --> 01:12:32.180
It comes for sinners in
the middle of the night.


777
01:12:32.180 --> 01:12:34.707
Young or old. It comes for them.

778
01:12:39.530 --> 01:12:40.467
- Right. Um, okay.

779
01:12:40.467 --> 01:12:42.590
Well, um, so how are we supposed
to prove that it's real?


780
01:12:42.590 --> 01:12:43.540
- Jesus, it's real.

781
01:12:44.918 --> 01:12:47.450
Ah, we just need
to, ah, draw it out

782
01:12:47.450 --> 01:12:49.822
and record what transpires.

783
01:12:49.822 --> 01:12:53.873
That will, ah, that will,
that will prove everything.


784
01:12:54.799 --> 01:12:59.799
You know, they, they need
to know that they will see.


785
01:13:00.530 --> 01:13:01.650
They, they'll all see.

786
01:13:02.690 --> 01:13:04.692
They will all see...

787
01:13:04.692 --> 01:13:08.047
The sinners just will see...

788
01:13:09.471 --> 01:13:10.843
- It-
- Right, um.


789
01:13:10.843 --> 01:13:14.277
- Can you just put that thing
down before you break it?


790
01:14:03.938 --> 01:14:06.860
Come on, kid. Half the
job is carrying the gear.


791
01:14:10.040 --> 01:14:13.900
- Um, how long is this gonna take?

792
01:14:17.629 --> 01:14:21.623
- Well, paranormal activity
tends to die off come daylight.


793
01:14:25.754 --> 01:14:27.263
Jesus.

794
01:14:30.287 --> 01:14:32.363
And you said this place is unoccupied?

795
01:14:35.372 --> 01:14:39.794
Well, no one has been here since

796
01:14:39.794 --> 01:14:40.783
me and my wife were, um,

797
01:14:42.095 --> 01:14:46.770
mm, ah, we was moving in,
ready to fix it up to sell.


798
01:14:47.930 --> 01:14:49.223
But we never finished.

799
01:14:50.959 --> 01:14:51.793
- Why not?

800
01:14:54.699 --> 01:14:57.560
- Now, come on, we better carry
on before it gets any later.


801
01:14:57.560 --> 01:15:00.803
This is primetime for paranormal activity.

802
01:15:03.936 --> 01:15:06.003
- Whatever you say, captain.

803
01:15:41.539 --> 01:15:45.956
Come on, dude. It's paranormal
primetime or whatever.


804
01:16:16.781 --> 01:16:18.167
Some say hi.

805
01:16:54.859 --> 01:16:57.500
- Dude, what the
fuck's got you so jumpy?

806
01:16:57.500 --> 01:17:00.290
- Um, the power
here's just a bit dodgy

807
01:17:00.290 --> 01:17:03.620
and I, I don't quite like the dark.

808
01:17:06.500 --> 01:17:09.500
- A paranormal investigator
that's afraid of the dark.


809
01:17:09.500 --> 01:17:10.823
God, this is such a joke.

810
01:17:11.780 --> 01:17:14.120
- Everyone is afraid of the dark.

811
01:17:14.120 --> 01:17:15.709
- Okay, well, I still don't believe

812
01:17:15.709 --> 01:17:17.543
in this Boogeyman crap, so.

813
01:17:21.221 --> 01:17:23.183
- Just wait. You'll see.

814
01:17:34.100 --> 01:17:36.071
All right.

815
01:17:48.140 --> 01:17:50.751
Okay. I'm ready, hit the record button.

816
01:17:50.751 --> 01:17:52.734
- Ah, and then what?
- Just, just hit


817
01:17:52.734 --> 01:17:54.656
the record button.

818
01:17:57.500 --> 01:18:00.799
Good evening. Welcome to
another special edition


819
01:18:00.799 --> 01:18:02.750
of "Spectral Investigations."

820
01:18:02.750 --> 01:18:03.923
My name is John Conroy.

821
01:18:05.390 --> 01:18:09.080
Years ago, me and my wife
were subject to a series


822
01:18:09.080 --> 01:18:12.200
of terrifying encounters in this house,

823
01:18:12.200 --> 01:18:14.510
which led to her tragic death.

824
01:18:14.510 --> 01:18:16.910
Initially, I was blamed

825
01:18:16.910 --> 01:18:19.940
until the police ruled
it a tragic accident.


826
01:18:19.940 --> 01:18:23.030
But I know better, and
I know what took her.


827
01:18:23.030 --> 01:18:25.613
And I believe it has a
presence here in this house.


828
01:18:26.990 --> 01:18:30.920
In my sorrow, I traveled home to study

829
01:18:30.920 --> 01:18:34.280
with the world's leading
paranormal investigators


830
01:18:34.280 --> 01:18:36.567
to understand what I had seen.

831
01:18:36.567 --> 01:18:38.570
And now I have returned,

832
01:18:38.570 --> 01:18:41.660
determined to uncover the
truth once and for all.


833
01:18:41.660 --> 01:18:45.080
Armed with my custom spectral equipment

834
01:18:45.080 --> 01:18:48.170
and the help of my trustee assistant Rose,

835
01:18:48.170 --> 01:18:52.610
we aim to uncover the truth
of what you here in the states


836
01:18:52.610 --> 01:18:54.683
know as the Boogeyman.

837
01:18:57.680 --> 01:18:58.513
Cut it.

838
01:19:02.840 --> 01:19:04.070
- Dude, what the fuck?

839
01:19:04.070 --> 01:19:05.840
Did you just say
that your wife died here

840
01:19:05.840 --> 01:19:07.015
and you were suspected of murdering her?

841
01:19:07.015 --> 01:19:09.410
- Look, I know, 
I know how it sounds.

842
01:19:09.410 --> 01:19:10.942
No, I, I would
never do anything to her.

843
01:19:10.942 --> 01:19:13.520
Ah, I didn't, I didn't even
care that she was cheating.


844
01:19:13.520 --> 01:19:15.980
I, I, I, I, I loved her. No?

845
01:19:15.980 --> 01:19:17.510
- Nope. Fuck this, I'm out.

846
01:19:17.510 --> 01:19:19.212
Nope, I'm out.

847
01:19:19.212 --> 01:19:20.295
- 300.
- What?


848
01:19:22.091 --> 01:19:24.470
- Ah, I'll pay you 300 to stay.

849
01:19:24.470 --> 01:19:26.390
Rose, I'm, I'm, 
I'm begging you.

850
01:19:26.390 --> 01:19:29.093
Please, just, just stay with me. Please.

851
01:19:32.090 --> 01:19:33.037
- Make it 350.

852
01:19:34.467 --> 01:19:35.600
- That's a done deal. All right?

853
01:19:35.600 --> 01:19:38.480
We, you, you won't regret this, Rose.

854
01:19:38.480 --> 01:19:40.340
This, this, this is
gonna prove everything.


855
01:19:40.340 --> 01:19:43.340
And then, um, yeah, they need to see,

856
01:19:43.340 --> 01:19:46.129
we're gonna show them together, all right?

857
01:19:46.129 --> 01:19:50.146
Um, let's get some, um,
let's get some B-roll.


858
01:19:50.146 --> 01:19:51.803
interior shots, yeah?

859
01:19:52.879 --> 01:19:54.827
Yeah, let's do that.

860
01:19:54.827 --> 01:19:58.713
All right. Let's get some interior shots.

861
01:19:58.713 --> 01:20:00.379
Let's do that. Yeah.

862
01:20:01.234 --> 01:20:04.280
Ah, why is there no picture?

863
01:20:04.280 --> 01:20:05.980
- Is it turned on?
- Duh.


864
01:20:07.217 --> 01:20:09.170
Did you take the lens cap off?

865
01:20:09.170 --> 01:20:10.808
The, the what?

866
01:20:14.004 --> 01:20:16.754
- Hey, hey. Be careful with that.

867
01:20:17.628 --> 01:20:20.440
- Wait, did you see that?
- See, see what?


868
01:20:33.650 --> 01:20:36.950
All right, look, no matter what happens,

869
01:20:36.950 --> 01:20:39.376
you just keep recording, all right?

870
01:20:39.376 --> 01:20:40.476
I'm gonna be going in.

871
01:20:41.750 --> 01:20:43.940
- Oh wait, the screen just went black.

872
01:20:43.940 --> 01:20:45.049
- Did you take the lens cap off?

873
01:20:45.049 --> 01:20:48.320
- Oh, yes, but it looks
like the power is off


874
01:20:48.320 --> 01:20:49.940
even though the switch is set to on.

875
01:20:49.940 --> 01:20:52.760
- Oh, we must have gone
through a whole battery.


876
01:20:52.760 --> 01:20:55.583
Ah, did you grab that square black bag?

877
01:20:56.600 --> 01:20:58.820
- The what?
- Oh, must still still, oh,


878
01:20:58.820 --> 01:21:00.740
must still be in the car.

879
01:21:00.740 --> 01:21:02.718
I'll just go and get it.
- Wait, what the?


880
01:21:02.718 --> 01:21:04.879
No, you're not fucking leaving
me up here all by myself.


881
01:21:04.879 --> 01:21:06.049
- Look, it'll be fine, just stay here,

882
01:21:06.049 --> 01:21:08.810
leave the lights on and, ah,

883
01:21:08.810 --> 01:21:10.510
yeah, I'll be back in two seconds.

884
01:21:25.131 --> 01:21:26.798
- Well, hello there.

885
01:21:28.243 --> 01:21:29.953
- I'll be right back, Rose.

886
01:21:36.225 --> 01:21:38.575
Oh, my.

887
01:21:38.575 --> 01:21:39.825
Wow. Oh my God.

888
01:21:41.138 --> 01:21:42.388
Too easy. Jeez.

889
01:21:45.432 --> 01:21:47.777
Here we go.

890
01:21:52.203 --> 01:21:54.399
Oh my God. That's nice, oh.

891
01:21:54.399 --> 01:21:57.899
Shit.

892
01:22:09.781 --> 01:22:10.614
Shit.

893
01:22:14.345 --> 01:22:17.178
John. Goddammit.

894
01:22:51.503 --> 01:22:55.336
Oh my God! John!

895
01:23:00.477 --> 01:23:03.432
No! John, where are you?

896
01:23:22.084 --> 01:23:23.334
John? What the?

897
01:23:38.303 --> 01:23:39.720
- Got it. Got it.

898
01:23:54.385 --> 01:23:56.052
Goddamn electricity.

899
01:24:07.843 --> 01:24:09.010
What the fuck?

900
01:24:12.840 --> 01:24:13.673
Rose?

901
01:24:21.058 --> 01:24:21.892
Rose?

902
01:24:28.379 --> 01:24:29.212
Rose?

903
01:24:52.754 --> 01:24:54.088
- What the fuck?

904
01:25:01.553 --> 01:25:02.553
Oh, oh fuck!

905
01:25:05.247 --> 01:25:10.030
Oh my God.

906
01:25:11.316 --> 01:25:12.296
Oh my God.

907
01:25:20.720 --> 01:25:23.887
Oh my God.

908
01:25:28.457 --> 01:25:30.877
You fuck!

909
01:25:35.106 --> 01:25:35.939
Oh, God.

910
01:25:36.843 --> 01:25:39.163
Oh, shit.

911
01:25:39.163 --> 01:25:41.998
Oh, God.

912
01:26:01.926 --> 01:26:05.162
I, I knew it.

913
01:26:05.162 --> 01:26:06.662
It happened again.

914
01:26:08.700 --> 01:26:13.700
This is gonna prove everything.

915
01:26:17.283 --> 01:26:18.783
They're gonna see.

916
01:26:20.203 --> 01:26:22.250
They're all gonna see.

917
01:26:25.337 --> 01:26:27.250
John Conroy?

918
01:26:27.250 --> 01:26:28.816
This is Detective Lahey
- So, were in the middle


919
01:26:28.816 --> 01:26:29.923
of it, aren't we?
- with the Philadelphia


920
01:26:29.923 --> 01:26:31.423
Police Department.
- She was a sinner.


921
01:26:31.423 --> 01:26:34.519
- We're currently
investigating a missing female.


922
01:26:34.519 --> 01:26:36.285
This address has been
- He came for you.


923
01:26:36.285 --> 01:26:38.732
reported as
her last known location.


924
01:26:38.732 --> 01:26:40.147
We need to...

925
01:26:40.147 --> 01:26:41.617
He came for you.

926
01:26:41.617 --> 01:26:45.700
So that's what happens
if you're a sinner, Rose.


927
01:26:46.534 --> 01:26:49.322
That's what happens when you're a sinner.

928
01:26:49.322 --> 01:26:51.440
And then in the middle of the night,

929
01:26:51.440 --> 01:26:53.447
he's gonna come for you.

930
01:26:53.447 --> 01:26:55.370
Get ya.

931
01:26:55.370 --> 01:26:58.632
Perhaps right all along,

932
01:26:58.632 --> 01:26:59.775
- Clear!
- wasn't I, Rose?


933
01:26:59.775 --> 01:27:02.100
Clear!

934
01:27:02.100 --> 01:27:04.918
- Well, Rose? Do you hear that, Rose?

935
01:27:04.918 --> 01:27:06.420
Oh my God!

936
01:27:06.420 --> 01:27:09.168
- We do not turn the camera off.

937
01:27:09.168 --> 01:27:10.334
Sad, isn't it?

938
01:27:11.253 --> 01:27:12.890
You didn't believe this
silly shit, did you?


939
01:27:12.890 --> 01:27:16.010
- You sick motherfucker! Drop her!

940
01:27:16.010 --> 01:27:17.160
- Don't, don't you see?

941
01:27:18.286 --> 01:27:21.110
It happened again.

942
01:27:21.110 --> 01:27:22.850
The Boogeyman is real.

943
01:27:22.850 --> 01:27:24.770
And it came for her in the night.

944
01:27:24.770 --> 01:27:26.510
In the middle of the
night, it came for her


945
01:27:26.510 --> 01:27:29.022
'cause she was a sinner!

946
01:27:29.022 --> 01:27:30.650
Aren't you, Rose? Aye,
aren't you a sinner?


947
01:27:30.650 --> 01:27:33.287
- His was the hardest
piece together accurately.


948
01:27:33.287 --> 01:27:37.129
It usually resulted in him
going off track on these rants


949
01:27:37.129 --> 01:27:39.709
about his sinning and, well,

950
01:27:39.709 --> 01:27:42.022
I'll just say it was
hard to keep him focused.


951
01:27:43.070 --> 01:27:44.600
Can you imagine how hard it was

952
01:27:44.600 --> 01:27:46.340
to pry the camera away from him?

953
01:27:46.340 --> 01:27:49.013
He can't even hold a steady conversation.

954
01:27:52.459 --> 01:27:56.180
- Then how do we know if he
even has his story straight?


955
01:27:56.180 --> 01:27:57.650
How do we know if any of them

956
01:27:57.650 --> 01:27:59.573
are leaving out important details?

957
01:28:01.790 --> 01:28:04.942
- Well, for track records, a
little bit harder to fabricate.


958
01:28:05.870 --> 01:28:07.763
We have the references for it.

959
01:28:08.600 --> 01:28:11.330
I mean, as far as events themselves,

960
01:28:11.330 --> 01:28:13.430
if we are talking about
generalized psychosis,


961
01:28:13.430 --> 01:28:14.663
shouldn't really matter.

962
01:28:18.590 --> 01:28:20.660
- My gut tells me something
must have happened


963
01:28:20.660 --> 01:28:22.100
he's leaving out.

964
01:28:22.100 --> 01:28:25.190
Who's to say this delusional obsession

965
01:28:25.190 --> 01:28:28.910
with the sinning and wicked
hasn't always been there?


966
01:28:28.910 --> 01:28:31.820
So many people go undiagnosed for so long.

967
01:28:31.820 --> 01:28:36.290
This could just be his
first recorded disturbance.


968
01:28:36.290 --> 01:28:39.049
- Exactly, someone with his background

969
01:28:39.049 --> 01:28:43.250
probably had a breakdown at
some point, but he didn't.


970
01:28:43.250 --> 01:28:45.980
That's what's so crazy
about all of these cases,


971
01:28:45.980 --> 01:28:47.873
is that there's no common thread.

972
01:28:49.190 --> 01:28:52.533
Then enter,

973
01:28:55.520 --> 01:28:56.513
Shawn Kendall.

974
01:28:59.030 --> 01:29:00.980
You'll see that this
affliction goes beyond


975
01:29:00.980 --> 01:29:03.350
a simple diagnosis of schizophrenia.

976
01:29:03.350 --> 01:29:07.313
It exists in a broad spectrum
of generalized psychosis.


977
01:29:14.011 --> 01:29:15.494
What for?

978
01:29:15.494 --> 01:29:18.510
Where the fuck is it?

979
01:29:18.510 --> 01:29:20.090
- Where are you
going in such a hurry?

980
01:29:20.090 --> 01:29:23.930
- Have you seen my keys?
- No, I haven't.


981
01:29:23.930 --> 01:29:25.695
You haven't answered my question.

982
01:29:25.695 --> 01:29:28.670
I'm going out, mom.

983
01:29:28.670 --> 01:29:30.680
What do I need a fucking
release form or something?


984
01:29:30.680 --> 01:29:32.299
- Excuse me?
- Mom!


985
01:29:32.299 --> 01:29:33.352
- One month.

986
01:29:34.250 --> 01:29:36.650
- I'm not fucking using.

987
01:29:36.650 --> 01:29:40.040
- Just because I'm old doesn't
mean I don't keep track.


988
01:29:40.040 --> 01:29:42.860
- Okay, well, if your memory
is so fucking pristine,


989
01:29:42.860 --> 01:29:45.500
then maybe you can tell
me where I left my keys.


990
01:29:45.500 --> 01:29:47.859
- And back round we come
to my original question.


991
01:29:47.859 --> 01:29:50.123
Which was what again?

992
01:29:50.123 --> 01:29:52.129
- Huh. The one you refuse to answer.

993
01:29:52.129 --> 01:29:53.900
You know the rules.

994
01:29:53.900 --> 01:29:56.090
- I'm just going
out to help Mary Beth

995
01:29:56.090 --> 01:29:57.413
move a couch or something.

996
01:29:58.250 --> 01:30:00.110
- Where does she live?
- I don't know.


997
01:30:00.110 --> 01:30:01.730
Forest Grove somewhere.

998
01:30:01.730 --> 01:30:04.586
What do you want fucking
longitude and latitude?


999
01:30:04.586 --> 01:30:07.975
Ah, fuck! I'm so fucking
frustrated!


1000
01:30:11.600 --> 01:30:15.799
Look, mom, I'm trying really hard. Okay?

1001
01:30:15.799 --> 01:30:19.310
I completed the program, right? I'm clean.

1002
01:30:19.310 --> 01:30:20.720
I've been a good boy.

1003
01:30:20.720 --> 01:30:21.620
- That doesn't mean you don't have

1004
01:30:21.620 --> 01:30:23.150
to earn back your privileges.

1005
01:30:23.150 --> 01:30:25.610
You did that to yourself.
- Mm, I know, mom!


1006
01:30:25.610 --> 01:30:29.570
Okay, but can I please
just go see Ann Beth?


1007
01:30:29.570 --> 01:30:31.670
Oh, shit!

1008
01:30:31.670 --> 01:30:33.932
- Thought it was Mary Beth.
- I know, right?


1009
01:30:33.932 --> 01:30:36.590
That's what I meant to
say. But I gotta go, okay?


1010
01:30:36.590 --> 01:30:38.008
I'll be back.
- Shawn.


1011
01:30:38.008 --> 01:30:40.280
- I know, I know. Curfew is 10.

1012
01:30:40.280 --> 01:30:42.847
- Shawn.
- I, I promise, okay?


1013
01:30:42.847 --> 01:30:44.629
- You be good.

1014
01:30:44.629 --> 01:30:46.340
You know what happens to little boys

1015
01:30:46.340 --> 01:30:47.692
who disobey their mothers?

1016
01:30:49.670 --> 01:30:51.644
The Boogeyman gets 'em.

1017
01:30:53.750 --> 01:30:54.583
- Word.

1018
01:30:58.325 --> 01:31:01.248
Your mom sounds rough, bro.

1019
01:31:03.574 --> 01:31:04.827
- Yeah, no shit.

1020
01:31:04.827 --> 01:31:07.459
You know, you'd think that
she would quit her bitching


1021
01:31:07.459 --> 01:31:08.840
after I completed the program,

1022
01:31:08.840 --> 01:31:12.140
'cause I completed the
entire fucking 90 days.


1023
01:31:12.140 --> 01:31:14.570
You know? And she's still
acting like I'm some bad person.


1024
01:31:14.570 --> 01:31:15.890
Like I'm gonna go get in trouble.

1025
01:31:15.890 --> 01:31:18.200
Like I'm shaking babies and
beating ladies and shit.


1026
01:31:18.200 --> 01:31:21.230
No. I just like to smoke
a little bit of dope.

- Fuck, bro, you cannot be letting

1039
01:31:51.170 --> 01:31:53.423
some of them drunks around hand sanitizer.

- Really?
- Yes.


1041
01:31:55.790 --> 01:31:57.923
- Like a hand sanitizer? 
Hand sanitizer?

1042
01:31:58.970 --> 01:32:02.560
I never heard no one
drinking hand sanitizer.


1043
01:32:02.560 --> 01:32:06.170
You get fucked
up on some hand sanitizer.


1044
01:32:06.170 --> 01:32:08.783
Just mix it with little juice concentrate.

1045
01:32:09.799 --> 01:32:11.847
- Juice concentrate
and the hand sanitizer?


1046
01:32:11.847 --> 01:32:15.893
- Yeah. I mean, it's pretty
smart if you think about it.


1047
01:32:16.820 --> 01:32:18.530
Like 'cause no one's usually looking out

1048
01:32:18.530 --> 01:32:19.913
for hand sanitizer,

1049
01:32:20.750 --> 01:32:24.083
so it flies under the
radar and it's cheap.


1050
01:32:24.950 --> 01:32:28.170
Hell, a 40 proof bottle
of vodka is like 10 bucks


1051
01:32:29.120 --> 01:32:32.843
and a hundred proof bottle
of hand sanitizer is two.


1052
01:32:35.090 --> 01:32:38.093
- Word. Hand sanitizer.

1053
01:32:39.740 --> 01:32:43.931
It's simple economics,
really.


1054

1056
01:32:58.970 --> 01:33:01.250
- What? You said at 10 o'clock.

1057
01:33:01.250 --> 01:33:04.700
It's, it's not, it's
not, it's not even 9:45.


1058
01:33:04.700 --> 01:33:08.810
- It's late, Shawn. Some
people sleep at a decent hour.


1059
01:33:08.810 --> 01:33:11.450
Why are you sweating?
- What?


1060
01:33:11.450 --> 01:33:14.150

I swear to God.

- What's in the bag?

1064
01:33:21.290 --> 01:33:22.760
- It's just, it's stuff from the store.

1065
01:33:22.760 --> 01:33:24.799
It's like juice and smokes

1112
01:38:03.251 --> 01:38:04.834
Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

1113
01:38:06.422 --> 01:38:07.658
Oh, shit.

1114
01:38:10.555 --> 01:38:11.472
Ah, ah, no!

1115
01:38:13.464 --> 01:38:14.414
Shit, oh!

1116
01:38:16.970 --> 01:38:20.188
Mm. Can't get out now,
motherfucker, can you?


1117
01:38:51.393 --> 01:38:53.940
No, oh! What?

1118
01:39:24.001 --> 01:39:24.838
Hold on.

1119
01:39:28.257 --> 01:39:29.090
Oh, jeez.

1120
01:39:32.674 --> 01:39:33.507
Fuck.

1121
01:39:35.896 --> 01:39:36.729
Fuck.

1122
01:39:50.564 --> 01:39:51.831
Fuck.

1123
01:40:06.780 --> 01:40:11.780
Okay.

1124
01:40:16.638 --> 01:40:19.626
Ah, shit!
- Shawn, what is going on


1125
01:40:19.626 --> 01:40:21.721
down here?
- Go to bed, mom.


1126
01:40:21.721 --> 01:40:24.395
- You better not be-
- Mom, I said go to bed!


1127
01:40:28.651 --> 01:40:30.724
All right. You wanna play?

1128
01:40:35.611 --> 01:40:36.444
Oh!

1129
01:40:38.124 --> 01:40:41.484
Fuck is it? Fuck, fuck!

1130
01:40:43.070 --> 01:40:48.070
Ah!

1131
01:40:50.458 --> 01:40:52.349
Shit.

1132
01:41:00.963 --> 01:41:02.419
No! Mom!

1133
01:41:02.419 --> 01:41:05.295
Mom, wake up!

1134
01:41:05.295 --> 01:41:08.144
Mom, open the door! Mom!

1135
01:41:08.144 --> 01:41:10.453
Shawn, what are you doing?

1136
01:41:10.453 --> 01:41:11.732
- Mom!
- Stop!


1137
01:41:11.732 --> 01:41:13.482
- Mom, open the door!

1138
01:41:14.322 --> 01:41:16.459
Mom, goddammit!
- Stop it!


1139
01:41:16.459 --> 01:41:19.070
- Listen to me! There's
someone in there with you!


1140
01:41:19.070 --> 01:41:20.843
Mom!
- Stop!


1141
01:41:22.160 --> 01:41:24.510
You're scaring me!
- Mom, goddammit!


1142
01:41:24.510 --> 01:41:26.780
Would you just listen to me?

1143
01:41:26.780 --> 01:41:29.252
- You get outta here, Shawn, now!

1144
01:41:29.252 --> 01:41:31.406
What's wrong with you?

1145
01:41:31.406 --> 01:41:32.489
- Ah, dammit!

1146
01:41:34.919 --> 01:41:37.919
Shawn?

1147
01:41:50.268 --> 01:41:53.845
Mom, stand back!

1148
01:41:53.845 --> 01:41:56.017
Oh!

1149
01:42:06.877 --> 01:42:08.499
Oh, fuck!

1150
01:42:08.499 --> 01:42:10.082
Oh, mom! Shit, mom!

1151
01:42:11.042 --> 01:42:14.127
Oh, no, no, no, no,
no, no, mom, mom, mom!

1152
01:42:14.127 --> 01:42:15.044
Fuck! Fuck!

1153
01:42:16.008 --> 01:42:17.341
Goddammit! Fuck!

1154
01:42:22.673 --> 01:42:24.958
Fuck! Fuck!

1155
01:43:19.692 --> 01:43:22.111
What?

1156
01:43:22.111 --> 01:43:26.479
Fuck.

1157
01:43:28.281 --> 01:43:32.647
Okay.

1158
01:43:38.190 --> 01:43:39.022
Oh, fuck!

1159
01:43:45.813 --> 01:43:47.642
It was here! He was here!

1160
01:43:47.642 --> 01:43:49.207
He was here! I shot him!

1161
01:43:49.207 --> 01:43:52.424
I shot him five, 
I shot him five times!

1162
01:43:52.424 --> 01:43:54.061
I shot him five times!

1163
01:44:03.324 --> 01:44:05.284
Oh!

1164
01:44:05.284 --> 01:44:08.453
Look, I know it sounds crazy. All right?

1165
01:44:09.650 --> 01:44:10.730
But you have to believe me.

1166
01:44:10.730 --> 01:44:13.793
That's exactly how it happened.

1167
01:44:16.760 --> 01:44:20.303
- Right, so all of this,

1168
01:44:21.500 --> 01:44:26.500
this all happened before
or after you smoked crack


1169
01:44:27.410 --> 01:44:30.022
and drink hand sanitizer?

1170
01:44:32.536 --> 01:44:35.383
- Hmm.

1171
01:44:35.383 --> 01:44:39.399
After.

1172
01:44:45.120 --> 01:44:48.290
- After a month of detox,
Shawn Kendall regained


1173
01:44:48.290 --> 01:44:51.200
a complete control of his faculties.

1174
01:44:51.200 --> 01:44:53.840
Except he still hung on to the delusion

1175
01:44:53.840 --> 01:44:56.527
that the Boogeyman was in his closet.

1176
01:45:01.190 --> 01:45:02.123
- Curious.

1177
01:45:03.799 --> 01:45:05.513
- I know, indeed.

1178
01:45:06.510 --> 01:45:09.760
Oh.

1179
01:45:13.513 --> 01:45:15.263
Well, Dr. Moon,

1180
01:45:18.470 --> 01:45:21.799
you're a resilient woman,
but I respect you for it.


1181
01:45:21.799 --> 01:45:23.270
Thank you so much for today.

1182
01:45:23.270 --> 01:45:26.750
Ah, this place is, ooh, truly fascinating

1183
01:45:26.750 --> 01:45:28.820
and I feel like I can
make a difference here.


1184
01:45:28.820 --> 01:45:30.170
- I'd hoped you'd say that.

1185
01:45:31.070 --> 01:45:33.709
Well, ah, Dr. Patterson
will be here on Wednesday


1186
01:45:33.709 --> 01:45:37.490
to oversee all of your
introductions with the patients.


1187
01:45:37.490 --> 01:45:39.650
Um, welcome aboard, Dr. Makenzie.

1188
01:45:39.650 --> 01:45:41.120
- Thank you, Dr. Moon.
- Oh, please.


1189
01:45:41.120 --> 01:45:42.620
It's just Gabby.
- Gabby.


1190
01:45:42.620 --> 01:45:44.360
- Mm-hmm. Well look, it's a Sunday.

1191
01:45:44.360 --> 01:45:46.190
You should be with your family.

1192
01:45:46.190 --> 01:45:48.864
I'm just gonna give you a
gold star just for showing up.


1193
01:45:48.864 --> 01:45:53.209
Well, I do
take my work very seriously.


1194
01:45:53.209 --> 01:45:54.453
- I can see that.

1195
01:45:54.453 --> 01:45:56.240
I look forward to reading
some of your reports


1196
01:45:56.240 --> 01:45:59.299
on our more eccentric patients.

1197
01:45:59.299 --> 01:46:00.900
Here, I'll see you out.
- Okay.


1198
01:46:01.940 --> 01:46:04.129
Today was extraordinary.

1199
01:46:04.129 --> 01:46:06.080
- I'm glad you enjoyed it.

1200
01:46:06.080 --> 01:46:07.520
Dr. Patterson will be here on Wednesday.

1201
01:46:07.520 --> 01:46:10.250
- Okay?
- You're gonna be just fine.


1202
01:46:10.250 --> 01:46:11.900
- Good.
- Oh, actually


1203
01:46:11.900 --> 01:46:13.637
forgot my coat.
- Oh.


1204
01:46:16.747 --> 01:46:20.247
Okay.

1205
01:46:21.370 --> 01:46:22.203
Whew.

1206
01:47:14.760 --> 01:47:15.593
Dr. Moon?

1207
01:47:28.839 --> 01:47:29.672
Dr. Moon?

1208
01:47:33.239 --> 01:47:36.663
- It's only a game, Dr. Makenzie.

1209
01:47:40.401 --> 01:47:44.403
- It was so nice meeting
you, Dr. Moon. Huh.


1210
01:47:44.403 --> 01:47:47.010
I really think I can
make a difference here.


1211
01:47:47.010 --> 01:47:50.420
I, I can't wait
to meet all the patients.

1212
01:47:50.420 --> 01:47:54.337
I think I can help.

1213
01:47:55.794 --> 01:47:58.431
Honey, I got the job. 
I got the job.

1214
01:47:58.431 --> 01:48:01.887
I got the job.

1215
01:48:01.887 --> 01:48:06.170
I got, we start work on
my new job on Sunday.


1216
01:48:06.170 --> 01:48:08.502
