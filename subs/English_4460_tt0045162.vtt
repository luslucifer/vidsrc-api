the dried and frozen carcass of a leopard.</i>

was seeking at that altitude.</i>

Look at 'em.

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:59.160

that brings them?

14
00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:34.460
I used to watch the way they sailed
very carefully at first...

one of them in a story.</i>

I've gotten so nervous,
not being able to do anything.


18

I think we might make it as easy as possible

If he can't get a plane,
he'll be back with another truck.

One way or another,
it's not very important.


24
00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:10.460
I feel so helpless. I wish there was
something I could do.


25

You can take the leg off.

26

Or you can shoot me.
You're a good shot.

I don't see why this had to happen
to your leg in the first place.

What have we done-- either one of us--
to have had this happen to us?


33
00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:43.660
Well, I suppose that what I did...

34
00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:47.760
was forget to put iodine on it
when I first scratched it.


35
00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:54.160
We were after the impala,

A letter from the publisher

No.

You too,Jake.


1066
01:25:28.060 --> 01:25:30.060
It is a riddle.

1067
01:25:31.260 --> 01:25:33.160
" Kilimanjaro...

" is a snow-covered mountain,

1069

" and is said to be
the highest mountain in Africa.

" Close to the western summit...

" there is the dried

1074

So they would have us believe.

Oh, no, no.
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.


1078
01:26:09.160 --> 01:26:12.060
Here comes the kicker.

1079
01:26:12.260 --> 01:26:16.460
" No one has explained
what the leopard was seeking...


1080
01:26:16.760 --> 01:26:19.560
at that altitude."

1081
01:26:19.760 --> 01:26:22.160
Is that all?

1082
01:26:24.960 --> 01:26:28.260
It's an unsatisfactory story.
It ends badly.


1083
01:26:28.560 --> 01:26:31.860
But what was the leopard
doing up there in the first place?


1084
01:26:32.060 --> 01:26:34.560
That's the riddle.

1085

And if I can find the answer,
I'm supposed to win a prize.

Come on. Let's put
our fine minds together,Jake.


1087
01:26:41.260 --> 01:26:44.660
Perhaps he took the wrong turn
and followed the wrong scent...


1088
01:26:44.960 --> 01:26:46.860
and so he got lost and died.

1089

Yeah.

1090
01:26:52.560 --> 01:26:55.860
That's a very sensible solution, Emile...

Why did you suddenly
want to come here?

You owe me the courtesy
of being honest.

Because why I wanted to come here...

is the point
of the whole bloody joke.
