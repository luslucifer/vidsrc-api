00:00:11.596 --> 00:00:15.600
(♪♪♪)

3
00:00:47.565 --> 00:00:51.669
(♪♪♪)

4
00:00:52.971 --> 00:00:55.272
Sweetheart, time
to get up, okay?


5
00:00:55.305 --> 00:00:58.275
(♪♪♪)

6
00:01:05.282 --> 00:01:09.152
Sarah, uh, you
gotta know this, if...


7
00:01:09.186 --> 00:01:11.756
If you're not happy in
New York, if you don't like


8
00:01:11.789 --> 00:01:14.491
New York, you can always
come back here, you can


9
00:01:14.524 --> 00:01:17.996
study theater here, you may even
teach theater here.


10
00:01:18.029 --> 00:01:19.664
Don't jinx her, okay?

11
00:01:19.697 --> 00:01:21.531
Just don't j...
jinx the kid.


12
00:01:21.566 --> 00:01:22.667
It's... She'll do fine.

13
00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:23.835
What are you doing?

14
00:01:23.868 --> 00:01:25.268
I'm... I'm giving
her an alternative.


15
00:01:25.302 --> 00:01:27.005
It's not... I'm not
saying don't do it.


16
00:01:27.038 --> 00:01:29.239
But she knows she
has a house here.


17
00:01:29.272 --> 00:01:31.643
Well, but I wanna tell
her she can always come back


18
00:01:31.676 --> 00:01:33.077
here and it's not
a big deal.


19
00:01:33.111 --> 00:01:34.746
Oh God, just... I... I...
It's not a failure, right?


20
00:01:34.779 --> 00:01:36.014
I... I know.

21
00:01:36.047 --> 00:01:37.715
I and... I mean it's
probably not for me,


22
00:01:37.749 --> 00:01:39.684
but I'll take it one
day at a time, so yeah.


23
00:01:39.717 --> 00:01:40.885
Well, just don't
listen to anybody.


24
00:01:40.918 --> 00:01:43.688
You do your... you
own thing, okay?


25
00:01:43.721 --> 00:01:44.889
Especially, grandma, okay?

26
00:01:44.922 --> 00:01:46.223
Yeah, right, who's
gonna go watch her?


27
00:01:46.256 --> 00:01:47.892
- You?
- Yes.


28
00:01:47.925 --> 00:01:49.326
(Laughing) I will.

29
00:01:49.359 --> 00:01:51.428
Yeah, I bet you will.
(Chuckling)


30
00:01:51.461 --> 00:01:55.600
- Okay, guys, let's...
- She's always got a home here.


31
00:01:55.633 --> 00:01:56.701
I know that.

32
00:01:56.734 --> 00:01:58.168
We love her and she can
do anything here


33
00:01:58.201 --> 00:02:00.537
That she could do there.

34
00:02:00.571 --> 00:02:01.939
It's a terrible
place, New York.


35
00:02:01.973 --> 00:02:03.306
- You're jinxing her.
- It's very dangerous.


36
00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:04.374
You're jinxing the kid.

37
00:02:04.408 --> 00:02:05.877
- I'm not jinxing...
- Guys, it's okay, it's okay.


38
00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:06.978
It'll be fine, guys.

39
00:02:07.011 --> 00:02:09.714
Oh, it's not a jinx,
I'm just giving her alternative.


40
00:02:09.747 --> 00:02:11.716
(Sighs)

41
00:02:11.749 --> 00:02:14.786
She knows she's
got a home here forever.


42
00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:16.486
Why are you
pushing around?


43
00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:17.855
Guys, it's okay.

44
00:02:17.889 --> 00:02:19.123
- It's okay, I'm gonna be great.
- (Laughing)


45
00:02:19.157 --> 00:02:20.591
I promise you,

46
00:02:20.625 --> 00:02:23.293
- I... I will...
- I'm sure you're gonna be just fine.


47
00:02:23.326 --> 00:02:24.896
How's your time, honey?

48
00:02:24.929 --> 00:02:27.297
Well, we're good to go,
we have a couple more minutes.


49
00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:31.069
Okay, baby, you just watch
your step out there.


50
00:02:31.102 --> 00:02:32.670
Watch out for
shady people.


51
00:02:32.704 --> 00:02:35.840
New York is full
of shady people.


52
00:02:35.873 --> 00:02:38.743
You be careful, 'cause
you're a good girl.


53
00:02:38.776 --> 00:02:42.412
Your father was a bum you
know, and your mom


54
00:02:42.446 --> 00:02:45.382
was a very troubled spirit.

55
00:02:45.415 --> 00:02:49.854
But you're not either of
them, you're your own, kid.


56
00:02:49.887 --> 00:02:53.091
And you got me as a grandpa
and the apple does not


57
00:02:53.124 --> 00:02:55.727
fall far from
the tree, okay?


58
00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:56.961
Don't worry, grandpa.

59
00:02:56.994 --> 00:02:58.596
I'm gonna go to New York
and I'm gonna crush it.


60
00:02:58.629 --> 00:03:00.497
- (Laughing)
- You know, I'm gonna conquer it.


61
00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:01.933
Oh.

62
00:03:01.966 --> 00:03:03.400
(Woman chuckling) Just
give me a month, two tops,


63
00:03:03.433 --> 00:03:05.335
- and I'll own the town.
- GRANDPA: You'll own the town.


64
00:03:05.368 --> 00:03:06.704
- (Chuckling)
- GRANDPA: You're a monkey, come on.


65
00:03:06.738 --> 00:03:08.271
(Laughing)

66
00:03:08.305 --> 00:03:11.676
You're a wonderful kid, you'll
do fine, okay?


67
00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:15.880
Anything you need, just jump on
the phone, okay?


68
00:03:15.913 --> 00:03:17.148
I love you, grandpa.

69
00:03:17.181 --> 00:03:18.616
Yeah.

70
00:03:18.649 --> 00:03:21.786
(Sobbing)

71
00:03:22.987 --> 00:03:24.421
GRANDPA: But you ain't
got enough money.


72
00:03:24.454 --> 00:03:25.522
I do.

73
00:03:25.556 --> 00:03:27.424
Yeah, I'll be...
I'll be okay.


74
00:03:27.457 --> 00:03:28.391
GRANDPA:
Oh, give me some.


75
00:03:28.425 --> 00:03:31.394
(Laughing together)

76
00:03:31.428 --> 00:03:35.332
(♪♪♪)

77
00:03:55.485 --> 00:03:58.089
Your grandfather was one cool
cat when I knew him.


78
00:03:58.122 --> 00:03:59.557
He was?

79
00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:01.559
Of course, he was.

80
00:04:01.592 --> 00:04:03.393
So I'm here to help
in any way I can.


81
00:04:03.426 --> 00:04:06.197
Just let me know if you
need anything, okay?


82
00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:07.799
Thank you, Helena.

83
00:04:07.832 --> 00:04:10.134
You know, the best
criteria for getting


84
00:04:10.168 --> 00:04:12.804
a New York apartment or
not is whether something


85
00:04:12.837 --> 00:04:14.639
moves on the floor
when you walk in.


86
00:04:14.672 --> 00:04:16.140
Ha!

87
00:04:16.174 --> 00:04:19.177
Well, nothing ran on the floor,
so I guess I'm good.


88
00:04:19.210 --> 00:04:21.012
(Chuckling)

89
00:04:22.213 --> 00:04:24.215
(Zipping)

90
00:04:28.119 --> 00:04:30.520
Your first day?

91
00:04:30.555 --> 00:04:32.824
Does it show?

92
00:04:32.857 --> 00:04:35.325
(Takes a deep breath) I'm looking
for the financial aid office.


93
00:04:35.358 --> 00:04:38.296
It's right here.

94
00:04:38.328 --> 00:04:39.831
I'm Philip.

95
00:04:39.864 --> 00:04:41.331
- Sarah.
- Come on.


96
00:04:41.364 --> 00:04:42.900
Thanks. (Chuckling)

97
00:04:48.239 --> 00:04:50.708
(Clears throat)

98
00:04:50.741 --> 00:04:52.076
- I know, I know...
- Hmm.


99
00:04:52.109 --> 00:04:53.476
A banana is a
healthier source of


100
00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:55.079
potassium than
potato chips.


101
00:04:55.112 --> 00:04:57.347
Me, I'm hooked on
potato chips and I don't mean


102
00:04:57.380 --> 00:05:00.417
- the organic shit either.
- (Chuckling) I hear you.


103
00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:01.652
- I'm Sarah.
- Luna.


104
00:05:01.686 --> 00:05:03.688
My parents smoked
a lot of weed.


105
00:05:03.721 --> 00:05:04.922
This is Josie.

106
00:05:04.956 --> 00:05:07.625
How small a town
are you from anyway?


107
00:05:07.658 --> 00:05:09.660
Does it show that much?

108
00:05:09.694 --> 00:05:11.428
- Oh yeah.
- (Chuckling)


109
00:05:11.461 --> 00:05:12.997
Everyone knows everyone.

110
00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:15.032
Everyone knows what
everyone ate for breakfast.


111
00:05:15.066 --> 00:05:16.033
You?

112
00:05:16.067 --> 00:05:16.868
Queens.

113
00:05:16.901 --> 00:05:18.035
Nobody knows nothing.

114
00:05:18.069 --> 00:05:19.070
Jersey City.

115
00:05:19.103 --> 00:05:19.871
Nobody cares.

116
00:05:19.904 --> 00:05:21.906
Like nobody. (Chuckles)

117
00:05:21.939 --> 00:05:23.440
- I'm Sarah.
- Jasmine.


118
00:05:23.473 --> 00:05:25.042
Nice to meet
you, new girl.


119
00:05:25.076 --> 00:05:27.211
So do you guys
have any advice?


120
00:05:27.245 --> 00:05:28.312
Any tips?

121
00:05:28.346 --> 00:05:29.847
Regarding?

122
00:05:29.881 --> 00:05:31.349
Living in New York City.

123
00:05:31.381 --> 00:05:33.050
Oh wow! (Chuckles)

124
00:05:33.084 --> 00:05:34.785
Oh, this is gonna be good.

125
00:05:34.819 --> 00:05:36.621
Gee, I don't know if I'm
really the person to ask.


126
00:05:36.654 --> 00:05:38.189
She's not the person
to ask.


127
00:05:38.222 --> 00:05:40.358
All I can say is get
used to lots of noise.


128
00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:41.491
And the filth.

129
00:05:41.524 --> 00:05:43.794
And totally
disgusting smells.


130
00:05:43.828 --> 00:05:45.796
Like smells you never
knew could exist.


131
00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:47.765
- LUNA: And rude behavior...
- JOSIE: Totally rude.


132
00:05:47.798 --> 00:05:48.699
LUNA:
Just be ready for anything.


133
00:05:48.733 --> 00:05:49.967
JOSIE:
And everything.


134
00:05:50.001 --> 00:05:52.603
And totally fucking
disgusting smells.


135
00:05:52.637 --> 00:05:54.437
Don't forget
that, I'm serious.


136
00:05:54.471 --> 00:05:56.107
Gotcha. (Chuckles)

137
00:05:56.140 --> 00:05:59.277
Um, did I miss anything
important first semester?


138
00:05:59.310 --> 00:06:01.946
- LUNA: (Chuckling) Not a fuckin' thing.
- (Chuckling)


139
00:06:01.979 --> 00:06:04.949
(Birds chirping and traffic
whooshing in distance)


140
00:06:09.353 --> 00:06:10.922
- (Yawning)
- (Together) Oh!


141
00:06:10.955 --> 00:06:13.391
(Chuckling)
Excuse me, I'm sorry.


142
00:06:13.423 --> 00:06:16.060
Oh, excuse me, I'm sorry.

143
00:06:16.093 --> 00:06:17.995
You... you're my new
neighbor, right?


144
00:06:18.029 --> 00:06:19.630
Oh, um, I guess.

145
00:06:19.664 --> 00:06:21.299
Uh, I'm Sarah.

146
00:06:21.332 --> 00:06:22.600
Sarah Quintana.

147
00:06:22.633 --> 00:06:23.601
Frankie.

148
00:06:23.634 --> 00:06:24.769
Frankie Li.

149
00:06:24.802 --> 00:06:25.770
It's nice to meet you.

150
00:06:25.803 --> 00:06:27.772
Um, long night?

151
00:06:27.805 --> 00:06:31.309
Long night, long day,
turned to long night.


152
00:06:31.342 --> 00:06:34.845
(Chuckles)
You keep odd hours, Frankie Li.


153
00:06:34.879 --> 00:06:37.581
Saving life has
no time clock.


154
00:06:37.615 --> 00:06:39.449
I'm in the liquid
therapy business.


155
00:06:39.482 --> 00:06:40.618
I own a bar.

156
00:06:40.651 --> 00:06:41.518
(Traffic honking in background)
Oh.


157
00:06:41.552 --> 00:06:42.720
Oh, good to know.

158
00:06:42.753 --> 00:06:44.555
Um, guess I'll
see you around.


159
00:06:44.588 --> 00:06:46.390
Yeah, see you around.

160
00:06:49.994 --> 00:06:51.595
I meet nothin'
but neurotics and


161
00:06:51.629 --> 00:06:53.097
head-cases in this city.

162
00:06:53.130 --> 00:06:55.399
So I start this online
dating thing since


163
00:06:55.433 --> 00:06:56.934
my wife flew the coop.

164
00:06:56.968 --> 00:06:58.501
No luck.

165
00:06:58.535 --> 00:06:59.904
But I went out on a date
with this woman,


166
00:06:59.937 --> 00:07:02.239
she was a prison guard
and she had a personality


167
00:07:02.273 --> 00:07:04.608
- to match.
- Hmm.


168
00:07:04.642 --> 00:07:06.277
She's a delicate flower.

169
00:07:06.310 --> 00:07:07.812
No.

170
00:07:07.845 --> 00:07:09.880
This girl kicked both
our asses before breakfast.


171
00:07:09.914 --> 00:07:12.283
I'm talking about Sarah.

172
00:07:12.316 --> 00:07:13.317
Who the hell is Sarah?

173
00:07:13.351 --> 00:07:16.420
The girl that just
moved into my building.


174
00:07:16.454 --> 00:07:17.421
Did you make your move?

175
00:07:17.455 --> 00:07:18.889
What move?

176
00:07:18.923 --> 00:07:20.257
Not yet.

177
00:07:20.291 --> 00:07:21.459
What are you waiting for?

178
00:07:21.491 --> 00:07:23.194
You ain't gettin'
any younger.


179
00:07:23.227 --> 00:07:24.562
Listen, come here,
let me see something.


180
00:07:24.595 --> 00:07:25.963
Open up your mouth.

181
00:07:25.997 --> 00:07:27.198
Ah.

182
00:07:27.231 --> 00:07:29.467
Listen, I can't send you
into battle with dirty teeth


183
00:07:29.499 --> 00:07:31.469
if this girl's
all you said she is.


184
00:07:31.534 --> 00:07:32.636
I gotta clean you up.

185
00:07:32.670 --> 00:07:36.674
(♪♪♪)

186
00:08:06.303 --> 00:08:09.106
(♪♪♪)

187
00:08:12.109 --> 00:08:14.612
Mm.

188
00:08:15.746 --> 00:08:17.848
You need new headshots.

189
00:08:17.882 --> 00:08:20.451
Listen, uh...
uh, I gotta guy.


190
00:08:20.484 --> 00:08:22.319
So anyway, where do you see
yourself, Miss Sarah,


191
00:08:22.353 --> 00:08:24.155
in the next five years?

192
00:08:24.188 --> 00:08:25.256
Oh, jeez.

193
00:08:25.289 --> 00:08:27.558
Um, five years.

194
00:08:27.591 --> 00:08:31.462
Um, well, I mean I...

195
00:08:31.495 --> 00:08:34.765
I'd like to do like
film, TV.


196
00:08:34.799 --> 00:08:39.003
Um, you know, like
serious drama you know,


197
00:08:39.036 --> 00:08:42.440
um, m... more specifically
serious drama like... uh,


198
00:08:42.473 --> 00:08:44.975
like Shakespeare
in the Park.


199
00:08:45.009 --> 00:08:48.612
Um, and... yeah, I mean I...
I'd really like to do like


200
00:08:48.646 --> 00:08:50.781
some day player, recurring
roles you know,


201
00:08:50.815 --> 00:08:53.017
- build my résumé.
- Look,


202
00:08:53.050 --> 00:08:56.787
the reason why I'm such a great
agent is I'm realistic.


203
00:08:56.821 --> 00:09:00.091
You come in with these big
dreams, I'm here to stomp


204
00:09:00.124 --> 00:09:03.627
them out, and maybe on
the way, you and I can


205
00:09:03.661 --> 00:09:05.062
make some dough.

206
00:09:05.096 --> 00:09:06.630
You dig?

207
00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:13.572
I think I'm gonna sign
you, not because I like you,


208
00:09:13.604 --> 00:09:15.239
because I think
you and I, we could make


209
00:09:15.272 --> 00:09:17.374
some money together.

210
00:09:17.408 --> 00:09:20.411
And you can learn a
little about the business.


211
00:09:20.444 --> 00:09:24.849
Anyway, you have
a short skirt?


212
00:09:24.882 --> 00:09:25.749
Yeah.

213

How about nudity?

219
00:09:34.425 --> 00:09:35.493
You do nudity, right?

220
00:09:35.526 --> 00:09:38.696
Oh, um... I don't know.

221
00:09:38.729 --> 00:09:40.965
- (Sighing)
- SARAH: I mean I guess it would really have to depend.


222
00:09:40.998 --> 00:09:42.633
There goes HBO.

Yeah, princess, I'll

226
00:09:53.777 --> 00:09:57.882
Gossip Guys, Sex in the City you
know, things like that.


227
00:09:57.915 --> 00:10:00.918
Those shows aren't on anymore
and uh,


228
00:10:00.951 --> 00:10:02.820
the Gossip Guys
isn't a show.


229
00:10:02.853 --> 00:10:04.421
Yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah.


230
00:10:04.455 --> 00:10:05.823
Uh, I'll call you
when I need you.


231
00:10:05.856 --> 00:10:07.324
By the way, what's
your last name?


232
00:10:07.358 --> 00:10:08.325
Quintana.

233
00:10:08.359 --> 00:10:09.493
Quintana.

234
00:10:09.527 --> 00:10:10.694
Quintana?

235
00:10:10.728 --> 00:10:12.229
Way too ethnic.

236
00:10:12.263 --> 00:10:15.966
How about Sarah Q?

237
00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:20.037
You know, like... like
Suzie Q, but...


238
00:10:20.070 --> 00:10:21.906
Sarah Q.

239
00:10:21.939 --> 00:10:25.176
I think I could sell that.

240
00:10:25.209 --> 00:10:26.443
Sarah Q.

241
00:10:26.477 --> 00:10:28.746
(Clicks his tongue)

242
00:10:28.779 --> 00:10:31.782
Um, can I ask you why are...

243
00:10:31.815 --> 00:10:35.252
Why are these
pictures covered up?


244
00:10:35.286 --> 00:10:36.687
Well, I used to bang all
these chicks, I don't


245
00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:38.789
wanna see their
faces anymore.


246
00:10:38.822 --> 00:10:41.458
And this dude uh...
Long story, I was in college


247
00:10:41.492 --> 00:10:43.427
and uh, he was
actually pretty good,


248
00:10:43.460 --> 00:10:46.830
I had a crush,
so I kinda keep it there.


249
00:10:48.165 --> 00:10:49.568
Okay.

250
00:10:52.436 --> 00:10:55.139
(Traffic whooshing in
distance)


251
00:10:55.172 --> 00:10:56.707
Bob, what happened
to your hand?


252
00:10:56.740 --> 00:10:57.875
I got bit.

253
00:10:57.908 --> 00:10:58.809
Dog?

254
00:10:58.842 --> 00:11:01.345
- 10-year-old.
- Aw, my dog is 10.


255
00:11:01.378 --> 00:11:03.247
Not a dog, my patient.

256
00:11:03.280 --> 00:11:04.649
(Chuckles) Glad I don't
have a job that runs


257
00:11:04.683 --> 00:11:06.217
the risk of getting bit.

258
00:11:06.250 --> 00:11:07.218
You don't have a job.

259
00:11:07.251 --> 00:11:09.753
Hey, being unemployed is
a fulltime job, alright?


260
00:11:09.787 --> 00:11:12.089
Yeah, so is finding decent
woman in this town.


261
00:11:12.122 --> 00:11:12.990
Phew.

262
00:11:13.023 --> 00:11:15.826
Kasey, how come
we never went out?


263
00:11:15.859 --> 00:11:17.895
How come you say
my name wrong?


264
00:11:17.928 --> 00:11:18.729
Kasey.

265
00:11:18.762 --> 00:11:20.197
It's not Kasey.

266
00:11:20.231 --> 00:11:21.700
It's K.C.

267
00:11:21.732 --> 00:11:23.234
Like Kansas City.

268
00:11:23.267 --> 00:11:27.404
Okay, K.C., how come
we never went out?


269
00:11:27.438 --> 00:11:30.575
Oh, I just really don't wanna
ruin our friendship, Bob.


270
00:11:30.609 --> 00:11:33.143
Come on, K.C., ruin our
friendship, please!


271
00:11:33.177 --> 00:11:35.913
(Scoffs) Bob, take
it down a notch.


272
00:11:35.946 --> 00:11:37.481
- Too desperate?
- Oh yeah.


273
00:11:37.514 --> 00:11:39.950
(Chuckling)

274
00:11:39.984 --> 00:11:43.655
- Oh, excuse me.
- Uh, you're excused.


275
00:11:43.688 --> 00:11:45.322
Well, hey there, handsome.

276
00:11:45.356 --> 00:11:46.658
Oh, handsome.

277
00:11:46.691 --> 00:11:47.858
- Oh, she thinks I'm handsome.
- (Chuckles)


278
00:11:47.891 --> 00:11:49.694
- How are you?
- Good.


279
00:11:49.728 --> 00:11:51.596
Uh, I have an
oral fixation.


280
00:11:51.630 --> 00:11:54.298
Oh.

281
00:11:54.331 --> 00:11:55.432
Pistachios?

282
00:11:55.466 --> 00:11:57.501
I think you should start doin'
some special events


283
00:11:57.534 --> 00:11:59.069
- in your bar.
- Like what?


284
00:11:59.103 --> 00:12:01.138
You know, buy one, get two
free, somethin' like that.


285
00:12:01.171 --> 00:12:03.575
- Like you guys been getting.
- How about this?


286
00:12:03.608 --> 00:12:05.276
- Get two and get four free?
- How about this?


287
00:12:05.309 --> 00:12:06.410
What?

288
00:12:06.443 --> 00:12:10.514
You spend $100, $20 for
a cleaning at my dentist place.


289
00:12:12.182 --> 00:12:14.818
What's a classy guy like you
doin' in a dump like this?


290
00:12:14.852 --> 00:12:18.623
Oh, we like this
dump um, joint.


291
00:12:18.657 --> 00:12:19.957
(Clears throat) Place.

292
00:12:19.990 --> 00:12:23.728
- (Chuckling)
- What are you drinkin', miss?


293
00:12:24.663 --> 00:12:26.397
- Ooh!
- Phew!


294
00:12:26.430 --> 00:12:28.899
Let me think.

295
00:12:28.932 --> 00:12:31.770
God, there is just
so many choices.


296
00:12:31.835 --> 00:12:34.505
- (Chuckling)
- Right.


297
00:12:35.573 --> 00:12:38.275
You guys just let me
know when you're ready.


298
00:12:39.577 --> 00:12:42.413
(Grunting) What do you
recommend, big boy?


299
00:12:42.446 --> 00:12:45.249
Um, I don't know.

300
00:12:45.282 --> 00:12:49.219
What do... what do you...
what do you like to drink?


301
00:12:49.253 --> 00:12:52.189
Hmm, something sweet.

302
00:12:52.222 --> 00:12:53.390
(Chuckling) Like you.

303
00:12:53.424 --> 00:12:55.526
S... s... sweet?

304
00:12:55.560 --> 00:12:58.697
(Chuckling) She... she
thinks I'm sweet.


305
00:12:58.730 --> 00:13:02.567
People spend $100 on alcohol,
they come to my office,


306
00:13:02.600 --> 00:13:05.369
get a free cleaning,
but they have to


307
00:13:05.402 --> 00:13:07.104
be beautiful women.

308
00:13:09.973 --> 00:13:11.508
You uh, lookin'
for someone?


309
00:13:11.542 --> 00:13:13.077
Yeah, the... the chick
that was just here.


310
00:13:13.110 --> 00:13:14.511
- The blonde with the tits.
- Oh, yeah?


311
00:13:14.545 --> 00:13:15.814
Yeah, really?

312
00:13:15.846 --> 00:13:18.048
- You mean my wife?
- Yeah, the... no...


313
00:13:18.082 --> 00:13:19.350
No.

314
00:13:19.383 --> 00:13:21.385
- Hey, you done with class for the day?
- Yep.


315
00:13:21.418 --> 00:13:22.554
Cool.

316
00:13:22.587 --> 00:13:23.655
Let's hang.

317
00:13:23.688 --> 00:13:26.558
- Oh, I can't...
- Uh, Homburg at 6:00.


318
00:13:26.591 --> 00:13:29.193
- What?
- (Takes a deep breath)


319
00:13:29.226 --> 00:13:30.562
Barry Homburg.

320
00:13:30.595 --> 00:13:31.929
His classes are
the psychological


321
00:13:31.962 --> 00:13:34.932
equivalent of undergoing
a Nazi medical experiment.


322
00:13:34.965 --> 00:13:36.500
Whoa. (Chuckles)

323
00:13:36.533 --> 00:13:39.136
Anyway, can we hang
or what?


324
00:13:39.169 --> 00:13:40.404
I can't.

325
00:13:40.437 --> 00:13:41.840
I actually have a meeting
with a manager.


326
00:13:41.872 --> 00:13:43.073
- Awesome.
- (Chuckling)


327
00:13:43.107 --> 00:13:44.108
Who's the manager?

328
00:13:44.141 --> 00:13:46.143
Um, have you heard
of Alessandra Berry?


329
00:13:46.176 --> 00:13:47.478
No.

330
00:13:47.511 --> 00:13:48.479
What's the difference
between an agent


331
00:13:48.512 --> 00:13:50.314
and a manager, anyway?

332
00:13:50.347 --> 00:13:52.784
- 5%.
- Okay.


333
00:13:52.817 --> 00:13:54.753
You have a real
commercial look.


334
00:13:54.786 --> 00:13:56.788
You mean, like
for commercials?


335
00:13:56.821 --> 00:13:59.323
Commercials, pilots,
features, web series.


336
00:13:59.356 --> 00:14:00.457
- (Indistinct chatter in background)
- (Chuckles)


337
00:14:00.491 --> 00:14:03.327
So where is your
office located?


338
00:14:03.360 --> 00:14:04.662
Right here.

339
00:14:04.696 --> 00:14:05.730
In this building?

340
00:14:05.764 --> 00:14:07.197
In this restaurant.

341
00:14:07.231 --> 00:14:08.833
Wherever I happen to
be, that's my office.


342
00:14:08.867 --> 00:14:09.701
I see.

343
00:14:09.734 --> 00:14:10.968
Ladies, how is everything?

344
00:14:11.001 --> 00:14:12.604
Just fine.

345
00:14:12.637 --> 00:14:14.672
- WAITRESS: Can I get you anything else?
- No, but you could leave.


346
00:14:14.706 --> 00:14:15.707
WAITRESS:
Uh.


347
00:14:15.740 --> 00:14:18.710
- Sure.
- Good.


348
00:14:20.377 --> 00:14:21.646
(Indistinct chatter in
background)


349
00:14:21.679 --> 00:14:23.681
Um, so uh...

350
00:14:23.715 --> 00:14:26.316
uh, how long have you
been a manager for?


351
00:14:26.350 --> 00:14:27.384
Two months.

352
00:14:27.418 --> 00:14:30.521
I used to be an assistant
for Roger Savage.


353
00:14:30.555 --> 00:14:32.256
(Chuckles) Roger Savage.

354
00:14:32.289 --> 00:14:33.457
ALESSANDRA:
Oh, you know him?


355
00:14:33.490 --> 00:14:35.092
I've heard of him.

356
00:14:35.125 --> 00:14:37.394
Yeah, he sleeps in his office
and he's really fucked up.


357
00:14:37.428 --> 00:14:39.997
Uh, what's your
last name, again?


358
00:14:40.030 --> 00:14:41.231
Um, Quintana.

359
00:14:41.265 --> 00:14:43.300
Oh, that's so
fucking perfect.


360
00:14:43.333 --> 00:14:44.636
Wait, really?

361
00:14:44.669 --> 00:14:46.303
You don't think
it's too ethnic?


362
00:14:46.336 --> 00:14:47.938
Ethnicity is in.

363
00:14:47.971 --> 00:14:49.373
Diversity, kid.

364
00:14:49.406 --> 00:14:52.009
- So I shouldn't change my name?
- No.


365
00:14:52.042 --> 00:14:53.912
It's never been more
advantageous in this


366
00:14:53.944 --> 00:14:56.915
business to be anything other
than a white man.


367
00:14:59.416 --> 00:15:02.052
They don't... they don't show you
movies here, do they?


368
00:15:02.085 --> 00:15:03.688
(Scoffs) I wish.

369
00:15:03.721 --> 00:15:08.693
Well, it's up to you,
you're on your own.


370
00:15:08.726 --> 00:15:11.896
You absolutely must
know vintage cinema.


371
00:15:11.930 --> 00:15:13.832
Like old movies?

372
00:15:13.865 --> 00:15:16.901
Like our cinematic legacy.

373
00:15:16.935 --> 00:15:20.404
If you haven't seen Tay
Garnett's <i>One Way Passage</i>


374
00:15:20.437 --> 00:15:22.072
from 1932.

375
00:15:22.105 --> 00:15:24.909
It's not an old movie,
it's a new movie.


376
00:15:24.943 --> 00:15:27.211
Why did you want to
be an actor, anyway?


377
00:15:27.244 --> 00:15:29.179
It's all I've ever done.

378
00:15:29.213 --> 00:15:30.648
It's all I wanted to do.

379
00:15:30.682 --> 00:15:32.549
It's all I can do.
(Chuckling)


380
00:15:32.584 --> 00:15:35.152
What's the most important thing
about acting?


381
00:15:35.185 --> 00:15:36.220
An agent.

382
00:15:36.253 --> 00:15:37.589
Obviously.

383
00:15:40.090 --> 00:15:43.260
You gotta know the work
of Spencer Tracy, Bette Davis,


384
00:15:43.293 --> 00:15:48.165
Gena Rowlands, Ben Gazzara,
Edward G. Robinson.


385
00:15:48.198 --> 00:15:51.903
How many of you have
heard of John Cassavetes?


386
00:15:51.936 --> 00:15:55.105
How about Wild
Bill Wellman?


387
00:15:55.138 --> 00:15:57.842
Who?

388
00:15:57.876 --> 00:15:59.443
What movies have you
made, Mr. Cavallo?


389
00:15:59.476 --> 00:16:01.579
Look it up on IMDB.

390
00:16:01.613 --> 00:16:04.716
I'm not gonna give
you my résumé.


391
00:16:04.749 --> 00:16:08.385
And remember, the best directors
are total film geeks.


392
00:16:08.418 --> 00:16:10.220
If you can, you can score
major points with


393
00:16:10.254 --> 00:16:12.422
them if you talk cinema
classics.


394
00:16:12.456 --> 00:16:14.157
That's awesome advice.

395
00:16:14.191 --> 00:16:18.161
It's not awesome advice,
it's the fuckin' lexicon.


396
00:16:19.831 --> 00:16:22.000
Blondie, what are you
practicing to be?


397
00:16:22.032 --> 00:16:23.835
The next Marilyn Monroe?

398
00:16:23.868 --> 00:16:27.471
Uh, actually, Mr.Cavallo,
my name is Piper.


399
00:16:27.504 --> 00:16:28.873
So what about TV?

400
00:16:28.907 --> 00:16:31.275
Oh, the poor man's cinema!

401
00:16:31.308 --> 00:16:33.878
I hope they pick
up your pilot.


402
00:16:33.912 --> 00:16:35.647
In film acting,
you get to underplay


403
00:16:35.680 --> 00:16:37.247
naturalistic acting.

404
00:16:37.281 --> 00:16:38.616
I want to be on Broadway.

405
00:16:38.650 --> 00:16:40.150
CAVALLO:
Oh yeah?


406
00:16:40.183 --> 00:16:43.453
What time do
you wanna leave?


407
00:16:43.487 --> 00:16:46.958
It's all in the diaphragm.

408
00:16:46.991 --> 00:16:49.259
(Chuckling)

409
00:16:49.293 --> 00:16:51.128
Ariel's Song
from The Tempest.


410
00:16:51.161 --> 00:16:52.095
"Hark, hark!

411
00:16:52.129 --> 00:16:53.163
Bow-wow.

412
00:16:53.196 --> 00:16:54.197
The watchdogs bark.

413
00:16:54.231 --> 00:16:55.232
Bow-wow.

414
00:16:55.265 --> 00:16:57.534
Hark, hark!"

415
00:16:57.569 --> 00:16:59.771
Alliteration, Jasmine.

416
00:16:59.804 --> 00:17:02.339

(Sighing) Jeanne,
stop finger trolling.


442
00:17:53.891 --> 00:17:55.927
Josie, continue.

443
00:17:55.960 --> 00:17:58.863
(Clearing throat)
(Sniffles)


444
00:17:59.797 --> 00:18:02.265
If I never find the right
someone,


445
00:18:02.299 --> 00:18:06.104
if I end up all alone,
if I never find the person


446
00:18:06.169 --> 00:18:08.706
to have the sweetness and the
pain of life with,


447
00:18:08.740 --> 00:18:10.140
if I never have children to take
care of me


448
00:18:10.173 --> 00:18:14.012
when I'm older then...
Then I'll end up all alone,


449
00:18:14.045 --> 00:18:16.446
by myself,
I don't want that.


450
00:18:16.480 --> 00:18:17.582
Who wants that?

451
00:18:17.615 --> 00:18:19.083
You think I do?

452
00:18:19.117 --> 00:18:20.084
You do?

453
00:18:20.118 --> 00:18:23.186
(Scoffs) I want a real
live flesh and blood


454
00:18:23.220 --> 00:18:26.124
soul mate, goddammit!

455
00:18:26.156 --> 00:18:28.559
I just know I'll
never have it.


456
00:18:28.593 --> 00:18:30.527
I just know it.

457
00:18:30.561 --> 00:18:32.396
(Sighs) I mean let's
fucking face it,


458
00:18:32.429 --> 00:18:36.868
I'm on the lonely
road to nowhere.


459
00:18:36.901 --> 00:18:37.969
Very good, Josie.

460
00:18:38.002 --> 00:18:39.671
(Takes a deep breath)
Thank you.


461
00:18:39.704 --> 00:18:42.640
Natural, real, present.

462
00:18:42.674 --> 00:18:44.474
Thank you, Miss Mashmeyer.

463
00:18:44.508 --> 00:18:46.343
Oh, Miz, if you please.

464
00:18:46.376 --> 00:18:48.278
I'm no longer an
ingénue, Although,


465
00:18:48.311 --> 00:18:50.048
I'm often mistaken for one.

466

Yez, Miz Mashmeyer.

467
00:18:52.116 --> 00:18:54.819
(Chuckling) Cute.

468
00:18:54.852 --> 00:18:58.956
Sarah, let's hope this
week is better than last.


469
00:18:59.924 --> 00:19:01.159
SARAH (Whispering):
Fuck me.


470
00:19:01.191 --> 00:19:05.596
Walk with presence,
with a sense of self.


471
00:19:05.630 --> 00:19:08.465
Stand up uh,
stand up straight.


472
00:19:08.498 --> 00:19:11.501
(Sighing) What is it
that you're hiding?


473
00:19:11.535 --> 00:19:13.871
D... do you all
see this, class?


474
00:19:13.905 --> 00:19:16.741
We can learn from
her ineptitude.


475
00:19:16.774 --> 00:19:18.943
I mean do you even
wanna be an actor?


476
00:19:18.976 --> 00:19:20.144
Why are you here?

477
00:19:20.178 --> 00:19:21.411
Of course I wanna
be an actor.


478
00:19:21.445 --> 00:19:23.513
Do you see how she pauses?

479
00:19:23.547 --> 00:19:27.618
It's because she
is not clear.


480
00:19:27.652 --> 00:19:30.520
(Sighs) Can I please sit
down, Miz Mashmeyer?


481
00:19:32.023 --> 00:19:35.225
No.

482
00:19:35.258 --> 00:19:37.327
Aw, are you crying?

483
00:19:37.360 --> 00:19:38.663
- Why are you crying?
- I'm not crying.


484
00:19:38.696 --> 00:19:40.832
Is it because you're
a little girl?


485
00:19:40.865 --> 00:19:43.034
Woman up, Sarah.

486
00:19:43.067 --> 00:19:46.436
Grow a pair and stop being
such a pathetic girl


487
00:19:46.470 --> 00:19:47.805
who's all about her looks.

488
00:19:47.839 --> 00:19:50.373
God, your weakness is
just embarrassing


489
00:19:50.407 --> 00:19:52.342
to all of us!

490
00:19:52.375 --> 00:19:54.912
(Takes a deep breath)

491
00:19:54.946 --> 00:19:56.546
It's a good thing it's also
a very good lesson


492
00:19:56.581 --> 00:19:59.016
for the rest of the class.

493
00:20:00.952 --> 00:20:03.988
Can I please sit
down, Miz Mashmeyer?


494
00:20:04.021 --> 00:20:04.956
Oh, oh, I don't know.

495
00:20:04.989 --> 00:20:06.657
Can you?

496
00:20:12.029 --> 00:20:14.431
Class, acting is raw.

497
00:20:14.464 --> 00:20:17.334
It is real, it
is visceral.


498
00:20:17.367 --> 00:20:19.070
When Meryl Streep was
still in class,


499
00:20:19.103 --> 00:20:22.039
she walked out amongst
her peers, took center stage,


500
00:20:22.073 --> 00:20:25.342
ripped up her skirt, and took
a giant steaming dump.


501
00:20:25.375 --> 00:20:30.447
Now that... That is acting.

502
00:20:32.950 --> 00:20:33.918
Class dismissed.

503
00:20:33.951 --> 00:20:36.453
Hey, how do you afford
a place in the Village?


504
00:20:36.486 --> 00:20:38.522
Every struggling actor
I know lives in either


505
00:20:38.556 --> 00:20:40.658
Bed-Stuy, Bushwick,
Greenpoint,


506
00:20:40.691 --> 00:20:44.595
Washington Heights, Jersey
City, maybe Actoria.


507
00:20:44.629 --> 00:20:45.997
What's Actoria?

508
00:20:46.030 --> 00:20:48.032
Astoria to most people.

509
00:20:48.065 --> 00:20:52.536
Oh, um, the landlord is an
old friend of my grandpa,


510
00:20:52.570 --> 00:20:54.705
so she's giving me
a huge break on rent.


511
00:20:54.739 --> 00:20:56.674
Hmm.

512
00:20:57.809 --> 00:21:00.443
I'm thinking
about leaving.


513
00:21:00.477 --> 00:21:01.979
LUNA:
Leaving?


514
00:21:02.013 --> 00:21:04.749
Leaving New York
and going back home.


515
00:21:04.782 --> 00:21:07.417
LUNA: Said every wannabe
who ever came here.


516
00:21:07.450 --> 00:21:09.620
Ended up 30 pounds
overweight with


517
00:21:09.654 --> 00:21:12.857
a red pickup truck parked
out front, a recycling bin


518
00:21:12.890 --> 00:21:16.160
filled with empty cans of
Coors Light, three rugrats


519
00:21:16.194 --> 00:21:19.764
runnin' around and another
one on the way, in a town


520
00:21:19.797 --> 00:21:22.600
where everyone knows everyone
and everyone's business.


521
00:21:22.633 --> 00:21:24.101
You should write prose.

522
00:21:24.135 --> 00:21:25.570
Sarah, this just in.

523
00:21:25.603 --> 00:21:27.470
Life is a motherfucker.

524
00:21:27.504 --> 00:21:31.108
Life in Manhattan
is a motherfucker on steroids.


525
00:21:31.142 --> 00:21:33.611
Tryin' to make it in show
business is a motherfucker


526
00:21:33.644 --> 00:21:36.113
on steroids
multiplied by 2.


527
00:21:36.147 --> 00:21:37.514
No, by... by 10.

528
00:21:37.547 --> 00:21:40.184
(Chuckling)
So let me get this straight.


529
00:21:40.218 --> 00:21:41.484
I'm dealing with, what?

530
00:21:41.518 --> 00:21:44.722
Four motherfuckers, three of
which are on steroids?


531
00:21:44.755 --> 00:21:47.424
- (Chuckling)
- LUNA: You can't quit yet.


532
00:21:47.457 --> 00:21:49.227
I won't let you.

533
00:21:49.260 --> 00:21:52.362
You need to stick around, see
how it all ends, right?


534
00:21:52.395 --> 00:21:54.431
I mean, all you
need is one break.


535
00:21:54.464 --> 00:21:56.801
(Sighing) I know just...
Even with the break


536
00:21:56.834 --> 00:21:59.502
I'm getting on rent,
it's just so expensive.


537
00:21:59.536 --> 00:22:02.405
Mm-mm, true.

538
00:22:02.439 --> 00:22:04.242
So how do you manage?

539
00:22:04.275 --> 00:22:05.508
Daddy's rich.

540
00:22:05.542 --> 00:22:07.879
Oh, that helps.

541
00:22:07.912 --> 00:22:10.815
(Waves crashing in
background)


542
00:22:10.848 --> 00:22:14.919
You... you really wanna make
some extra cash?


543
00:22:14.952 --> 00:22:16.988
I might have an idea.

544
00:22:17.021 --> 00:22:18.856
Of course.

545
00:22:18.890 --> 00:22:22.226
This might involve a little...
how do I put this?


546
00:22:22.260 --> 00:22:24.629
Under-the-radar activity.

547
00:22:24.662 --> 00:22:26.197
(Waves crashing in
background)


548
00:22:26.230 --> 00:22:30.601
(♪♪♪)

549
00:22:40.611 --> 00:22:42.847
(Sarah rings the bell)

550
00:22:44.615 --> 00:22:46.918
Were you followed?

551
00:22:46.951 --> 00:22:48.853
Um, followed by whom?

552
00:22:48.886 --> 00:22:50.655
Exactly.

553
00:22:53.624 --> 00:22:54.992
Come in.

554
00:22:57.695 --> 00:23:01.299
Um, I can't
stay very long.


555
00:23:01.332 --> 00:23:03.167
What, you gotta
catch your bus?


556
00:23:03.200 --> 00:23:05.069
Huh?

557
00:23:05.102 --> 00:23:07.338
DANNY:
I'm Mr. Danny.


558
00:23:07.371 --> 00:23:09.073
SARAH:
I'm Sarah.


559
00:23:09.106 --> 00:23:10.374
Sar... Please,
no last names.


560
00:23:10.408 --> 00:23:12.043
Sit down.

561
00:23:14.345 --> 00:23:16.814
Do you know why
you're here?


562
00:23:16.847 --> 00:23:18.049
Not sure.

563
00:23:18.082 --> 00:23:19.750
Good.

564
00:23:19.784 --> 00:23:22.820
How are you with
names and faces?


565
00:23:22.853 --> 00:23:24.454
Um, I don't know.

566
00:23:24.487 --> 00:23:25.756
Even better.

567
00:23:25.790 --> 00:23:27.457
Look, I need you to
run a little errand.


568
00:23:27.490 --> 00:23:30.127
No big deal.

569
00:23:30.161 --> 00:23:31.963
I'll give you
three C notes.


570
00:23:33.463 --> 00:23:36.567
(Rustling)

571
00:23:40.371 --> 00:23:42.173
You look a little
disappointed.


572
00:23:42.206 --> 00:23:43.774
Is that your way
of negotiating?


573
00:23:43.808 --> 00:23:46.844
Oh, no, I... I don't...
don't exactly...


574
00:23:46.877 --> 00:23:49.046
Okay.

575
00:23:49.080 --> 00:23:50.781
And here's another C note.

576
00:23:53.150 --> 00:23:55.019
Take it.

577
00:23:58.389 --> 00:24:00.257
Thanks.

578
00:24:00.291 --> 00:24:02.093
Now, let me cut
to the chase.


579
00:24:02.126 --> 00:24:04.562
- I want...
- (Toilet flushing in background)


580
00:24:04.595 --> 00:24:07.298
Now, that's Mr. Tommy.

581
00:24:07.331 --> 00:24:09.066
Hey.

582
00:24:09.100 --> 00:24:10.901
What do you hear,
what do you say?


583
00:24:10.935 --> 00:24:13.070
Hi.

584
00:24:13.104 --> 00:24:15.606
DANNY: Don't mind
him, he's good people.


585
00:24:15.639 --> 00:24:18.309
Now, I want you to pick
up a piece of luggage for me


586
00:24:18.342 --> 00:24:19.910
and bring it back here.

587
00:24:19.944 --> 00:24:22.179
Can you do that?

588
00:24:22.213 --> 00:24:23.748
Yeah, sure, I guess.

589
00:24:23.781 --> 00:24:26.283
Um, is there a specific piece
or style


590
00:24:26.317 --> 00:24:27.385
that you want?

591
00:24:27.418 --> 00:24:29.387
Yes, there is.

592
00:24:33.324 --> 00:24:35.426
This key.

593
00:24:38.262 --> 00:24:39.797
Yes.

594
00:24:39.830 --> 00:24:42.400
Hey, kid.

595
00:24:42.433 --> 00:24:43.768
Be a good kid.

596
00:24:43.801 --> 00:24:46.103
Bring me back a piece
of cheesecake.


597
00:24:49.473 --> 00:24:52.343
Okay, seriously,
what did you get me into?


598
00:24:52.376 --> 00:24:54.478
I go to this disgusting
apartment and


599
00:24:54.512 --> 00:24:56.514
there's these two
creepy old guys there.


600
00:24:56.546 --> 00:24:58.082
(Chuckling)
Where are you now?


601
00:24:58.115 --> 00:25:01.118
They gave me some key to
pick up a piece of luggage


602
00:25:01.152 --> 00:25:02.119
at a locker.

603
00:25:02.153 --> 00:25:03.254
Let me guess.

604
00:25:03.287 --> 00:25:04.655
The bus station?

605
00:25:04.688 --> 00:25:06.290
SARAH (On the phone):
<i>No, a bowling alley.</i>


606
00:25:06.323 --> 00:25:07.591
Hey.

607
00:25:13.564 --> 00:25:15.266
Aren't you gonna ask
me if I was followed?


608
00:25:15.299 --> 00:25:16.333
Followed by who?

609
00:25:16.367 --> 00:25:17.835
Whom.

610
00:25:17.868 --> 00:25:18.936
Yeah, whom.

611
00:25:18.969 --> 00:25:21.205
Whom on the range,
where the deers and the


612
00:25:21.238 --> 00:25:23.374
- antelopes play.
- (Laughing)


613
00:25:23.407 --> 00:25:25.576
I see you made
it back in record time.


614
00:25:25.609 --> 00:25:27.978
Probably ran all way after you
shit your pants, am I right?


615
00:25:28.012 --> 00:25:29.547
Not entirely true.

616
00:25:29.580 --> 00:25:32.149
And you forgot
my cheesecake.


617
00:25:32.183 --> 00:25:33.417
I'm sorry.

618
00:25:33.451 --> 00:25:34.752
Good work.

619
00:25:34.785 --> 00:25:36.887
Yah, let's not gloss over
this cheesecake thing


620
00:25:36.921 --> 00:25:38.789
or lack of thereof.

621
00:25:38.823 --> 00:25:39.757
I have to go.

622
00:25:39.790 --> 00:25:41.659
Don't you wanna know
what's in the bag?


623
00:25:41.692 --> 00:25:43.594
Come on, you
must be curious.


624
00:25:43.627 --> 00:25:46.097
Uh, I think I should leave.

625
00:25:46.130 --> 00:25:48.065
(Grunts)

626
00:25:49.767 --> 00:25:51.469
Bada bang.

627
00:25:51.502 --> 00:25:53.304
Cute, ain't it?

628
00:25:53.337 --> 00:25:55.673
Wait, is that
filled with heroin?


629
00:25:55.706 --> 00:25:57.975
Like... like in that movie
with Audrey Hepburn?


630
00:25:58.008 --> 00:26:00.111
Movie?

631
00:26:00.144 --> 00:26:02.446
She's talkin' about the
movie <i>Wait Until Dark</i>.


632
00:26:02.480 --> 00:26:03.814
Richard Crenna
was in that.


633
00:26:03.848 --> 00:26:06.350
Alan Arkin, too and
they both young.


634
00:26:06.383 --> 00:26:09.120
But it wasn't a teddy
bear, it was a doll,


635
00:26:09.153 --> 00:26:10.254
creepy young girl.

636
00:26:10.287 --> 00:26:11.789
Excuse me, sir?

637
00:26:11.822 --> 00:26:12.890
No, not you.

638
00:26:12.923 --> 00:26:14.191
The young girl in the
movie <i>Wait Til Dark</i>.


639
00:26:14.225 --> 00:26:17.495
It wasn't <i>Wait Until Dark,</i>
it was Charade with


640
00:26:17.528 --> 00:26:18.963
Cary Grant!

641
00:26:18.996 --> 00:26:21.499
Wait, I'm a drug mule.

642
00:26:21.532 --> 00:26:24.368
Uh, I am not stuffing anything
inside any body cavities.


643
00:26:24.401 --> 00:26:27.004
Nobody is stuffing anythin'
in your ass.


644
00:26:27.037 --> 00:26:28.639
Unless you want 'em to.

645
00:26:28.672 --> 00:26:30.875
No drugs inside,
nothin' inside


646
00:26:30.908 --> 00:26:33.511
but the factory stuffin'
from Taiwan.


647
00:26:33.544 --> 00:26:35.679
Today was just a test.

648
00:26:35.713 --> 00:26:36.547
What?

649
00:26:36.581 --> 00:26:37.715
Uh, what do you mean?

650
00:26:37.748 --> 00:26:38.716
A test for what?

651
00:26:38.749 --> 00:26:40.384
To see if we
could trust you.


652
00:26:40.417 --> 00:26:41.886
And to see if you
were competent.


653
00:26:41.919 --> 00:26:43.154
A little bit of both.

654
00:26:43.187 --> 00:26:46.924
Trustworthy and competent,
good characteristics


655
00:26:46.957 --> 00:26:48.125
for anyone.

656
00:26:48.159 --> 00:26:50.294
So you were just
screwing with me?


657
00:26:50.327 --> 00:26:52.997
If you call $400 merely
"screwing with you",


658
00:26:53.030 --> 00:26:55.399
then salud, Miss Sarah.

659
00:26:55.432 --> 00:26:56.500
Did you see
that movie Ted?


660
00:26:56.534 --> 00:26:58.969
This guy looks
like the guy Ted.


661
00:26:59.003 --> 00:26:59.970
Mr. Danny.

662
00:27:00.004 --> 00:27:01.138
Mr. Tommy.

663
00:27:01.172 --> 00:27:02.873
- It's Mr. Danny.
- It's Tommy.


664
00:27:02.907 --> 00:27:04.175
It's Danny.

665
00:27:04.208 --> 00:27:06.578
Whatever, that guy,
he's a friends with the uncle


666
00:27:06.611 --> 00:27:08.946
of some dude I was doin'
a few months back.


667
00:27:08.979 --> 00:27:10.881
Charming.

668
00:27:10.915 --> 00:27:13.417
- (Indistinct lyrics in background)
- 10 points.


669
00:27:14.385 --> 00:27:16.420
- Hey, girls.
- How's it going?


670
00:27:16.453 --> 00:27:17.589
Just tryin' to help
Sarah with a little


671
00:27:17.622 --> 00:27:19.390
gainful employment.

672
00:27:19.423 --> 00:27:21.058
Yeah, what do you
guys do for money?


673
00:27:21.091 --> 00:27:22.159
Don't ask.

674
00:27:22.193 --> 00:27:24.161
- Lap dances.
- That's funny.


675
00:27:24.195 --> 00:27:26.797
We're strippers.

676
00:27:26.830 --> 00:27:27.965
Wait, seriously?

677
00:27:27.998 --> 00:27:29.033
Where?

678
00:27:29.066 --> 00:27:30.367
Never in the city.

679
00:27:30.401 --> 00:27:31.702
You never know who's gonna walk
through the door.


680
00:27:31.735 --> 00:27:33.437
Right, like New Jersey
and Long Island.


681
00:27:33.470 --> 00:27:35.674
Anywhere except Manhattan.

682
00:27:35.706 --> 00:27:37.208
We can hook you up, Sarah.

683
00:27:37.241 --> 00:27:38.976
No experience necessary.

684
00:27:39.009 --> 00:27:40.711
Um, no thanks.

685
00:27:40.744 --> 00:27:42.780
I think I'll just stick
with Luna's friends.


686
00:27:42.813 --> 00:27:44.148
Suit yourself.

687
00:27:44.181 --> 00:27:45.316
Let us know if you
change your mind.


688
00:27:45.349 --> 00:27:47.985
Um, thank you.
(Chuckling)


689
00:27:48.018 --> 00:27:50.555
Who do I have to kill
to get some service around...


690
00:27:50.589 --> 00:27:53.123
(Gasps) Oh my God!

691
00:27:53.157 --> 00:27:54.559
In the corner!

692
00:27:54.593 --> 00:27:56.561
- It's K-Square.
- Wait, Kate Kerrigan?


693
00:27:56.595 --> 00:27:59.463
- Where?
- Back there.


694
00:27:59.496 --> 00:28:01.700
Oh my God, she is only
legit movie star to


695
00:28:01.732 --> 00:28:04.468
come out of our
school in decades.


696
00:28:04.501 --> 00:28:06.971
Is it like super uncool
if we go and talk to her?


697
00:28:07.004 --> 00:28:09.039
Hell, yeah.

698
00:28:09.073 --> 00:28:10.474
- Fuck it.
- Let's go.


699
00:28:10.507 --> 00:28:12.276
(Chuckling)

700
00:28:15.045 --> 00:28:16.681
So sorry to bother you.

701
00:28:16.715 --> 00:28:19.216
The four of us actually go
to the same school as you.


702
00:28:19.250 --> 00:28:21.518
- As you did.
- That you went to.


703
00:28:21.553 --> 00:28:24.321
(Chuckling) Conservatory.

704
00:28:24.355 --> 00:28:27.958
- Is that the new Bradley...
- KATE: Is Mashmeyer still there?


705
00:28:27.992 --> 00:28:30.060
LUNA:
Oh, yeah.


706
00:28:30.094 --> 00:28:31.428
She hated me.

707
00:28:31.462 --> 00:28:32.664
Wait, really?

708
00:28:32.697 --> 00:28:34.365
She hates me, too.
(Chuckling)


709
00:28:34.398 --> 00:28:35.532
And Sheldrake?

710
00:28:35.567 --> 00:28:36.867
Mmhmm.

711
00:28:36.900 --> 00:28:41.038
My ass was always black
and blue after his class.


712
00:28:41.071 --> 00:28:42.840
What about that
prick, Homburg?


713
00:28:42.873 --> 00:28:44.541
Still a prick.

714
00:28:44.576 --> 00:28:47.278
Yeah, well, you should
watch out for him.


715
00:28:47.311 --> 00:28:50.447
So could you come speak
at our school sometime?


716
00:28:50.481 --> 00:28:52.816
I'd rather
contract small pox.


717
00:28:52.850 --> 00:28:55.620
But really, let me ask you
something, did any of you


718
00:28:55.654 --> 00:28:58.255
have to audition
to get in?


719
00:29:00.124 --> 00:29:02.192
Of course not.

720
00:29:02.226 --> 00:29:04.128
They'll take
anyone who can pay.


721
00:29:04.161 --> 00:29:06.430
Uh, no offense, girls.

722
00:29:06.463 --> 00:29:08.700
And believe me, they do
nothing to prepare you


723
00:29:08.733 --> 00:29:12.803
for the real world, for
the realities of the business.


724
00:29:12.836 --> 00:29:15.640
So, how did you make it
then, Miss Kerrigan?


725
00:29:15.674 --> 00:29:18.108
You've only been
out for a few years.


726
00:29:18.142 --> 00:29:19.678
Luck?

727
00:29:19.711 --> 00:29:23.113
(Chuckles) Some luck,
but mostly really hard work.


728
00:29:23.147 --> 00:29:25.282
I started out doing
student films, short films,


729
00:29:25.316 --> 00:29:27.752
even background
in big movies.


730
00:29:27.786 --> 00:29:29.253
Yuck, extra work?

731
00:29:29.286 --> 00:29:30.588
Don't knock it.

732
00:29:30.622 --> 00:29:32.856
That's how I got into
the union and I was


733
00:29:32.890 --> 00:29:34.391
upgraded twice.

734
00:29:34.425 --> 00:29:36.093
1,000 bucks a day.

735
00:29:36.126 --> 00:29:38.128
Not a bad day's work.

736
00:29:38.162 --> 00:29:39.798
And when you get out
of conservatory,


737
00:29:39.830 --> 00:29:41.398
keep taking classes.

738
00:29:41.432 --> 00:29:43.967
There are so many good
places to study like


739
00:29:44.001 --> 00:29:48.272
One on One on West 27th
Street, And for God's sake,


740
00:29:48.305 --> 00:29:50.074
create your own
work, short films,


741
00:29:50.107 --> 00:29:52.577
plays, one-person shows.

742
00:29:53.911 --> 00:29:56.246
Damn, I really wish
I could keep talking,


743
00:29:56.280 --> 00:29:58.549
but I have a meeting
with my agent.


744
00:29:58.583 --> 00:30:01.720
Thank you so much for
your time, Miss Kerrigan.


745
00:30:01.753 --> 00:30:05.489
Oh, and most important,
don't drink the Kool-Aid.


746
00:30:07.958 --> 00:30:09.026
Hey, let's go, Katie.

747
00:30:09.059 --> 00:30:10.729
Car's waitin' outside.

748
00:30:10.762 --> 00:30:14.465
Ladies, my agent,
Abram Bernstein.


749
00:30:16.300 --> 00:30:18.969
Are you looking for
any new clients?


750
00:30:19.002 --> 00:30:20.904
What have you done?

751
00:30:20.938 --> 00:30:23.708
- Nothing yet, but I'm abo...
- I did a commercial for public access.


752
00:30:23.742 --> 00:30:24.709
Me, too.

753
00:30:24.743 --> 00:30:26.944
Um, we have a showcase
coming up at our school


754
00:30:26.977 --> 00:30:28.345
- pretty soon.
- Great.


755
00:30:28.379 --> 00:30:30.080
So call me when you've
done something.


756
00:30:30.114 --> 00:30:31.649
Somethin' professional.

757
00:30:31.683 --> 00:30:33.685
Ready?

758
00:30:33.718 --> 00:30:36.387
And you should think
about gettin' a nose job.


759
00:30:39.256 --> 00:30:40.759
- I do not need that.
- Bye.


760
00:30:40.792 --> 00:30:42.627
(Indistinct lyrics in
background)


761
00:30:43.595 --> 00:30:45.295
I know the drill,
I wasn't followed.


762
00:30:45.329 --> 00:30:47.197
(Laughing)

763
00:30:47.231 --> 00:30:49.032
You're a little fuckin'
wise-ass.


764
00:30:49.066 --> 00:30:50.769
I like that.

765
00:30:50.802 --> 00:30:51.969
Mr. Tommy.

766
00:30:52.002 --> 00:30:53.370
What do you want?

767
00:30:53.404 --> 00:30:56.808
This little wise-ass
friend Sarah is back.


768
00:30:56.841 --> 00:30:59.309
I don't feel totally
comfortable with all this.


769
00:30:59.343 --> 00:31:01.646
Then why'd you come back?

770
00:31:01.679 --> 00:31:03.748
I just want to know
what it's all about.


771
00:31:03.782 --> 00:31:06.450
Well, come back tomorrow,
we'll take a little field trip.


772
00:31:10.954 --> 00:31:12.791
Michael Kors hand bags.

773
00:31:12.824 --> 00:31:14.692
- Hmm.
- Hermes scarves.


774
00:31:14.726 --> 00:31:16.160
Rolex watches.

775
00:31:16.193 --> 00:31:18.630
North Face jackets.

776
00:31:18.663 --> 00:31:21.064
Nike sneakers.

777
00:31:21.098 --> 00:31:22.399
- Watches...
- TOMMY: Right.


778
00:31:22.433 --> 00:31:24.636
DANNY: All this beautiful
stuff and it's all fake.


779
00:31:24.669 --> 00:31:25.670
TOMMY:
Right.


780
00:31:25.703 --> 00:31:28.238
And don't forget the
Beats by Dre headphones,


781
00:31:28.272 --> 00:31:30.974
I use 'em myself.

782
00:31:31.008 --> 00:31:34.278
- So you guys are...
- We're in the wholesale/retail business


783
00:31:34.311 --> 00:31:35.212
you might say.

784
00:31:35.245 --> 00:31:36.947
Well put.

785
00:31:36.980 --> 00:31:39.651
Sarah.

786
00:31:39.684 --> 00:31:43.220
You can take great pride
that you're a cog


787
00:31:43.253 --> 00:31:44.955
in a well-oiled machine.

788
00:31:44.988 --> 00:31:48.258
A small cog, but
an important cog.


789
00:31:48.292 --> 00:31:50.695
We can't offer you
medical and dental,


790
00:31:50.728 --> 00:31:53.530
but your gross pay is
your take-home pay.


791
00:31:53.565 --> 00:31:58.268
Federal, state, city taxes,
you are exempt, my friend.


792
00:31:58.302 --> 00:31:59.604
By the way, you
play softball?


793
00:31:59.637 --> 00:32:01.071
What?

794
00:32:01.104 --> 00:32:03.775
Well, we need a shortstop for
our company softball team.


795
00:32:03.808 --> 00:32:05.610
You don't have to hit
much, but you know,


796
00:32:05.643 --> 00:32:07.978
make a few plays
in the field.


797
00:32:08.011 --> 00:32:10.949
What if the cops find
out about this place?


798
00:32:10.981 --> 00:32:12.917
About the softball team?

799
00:32:12.951 --> 00:32:14.051
I was just kiddin'.

800
00:32:14.084 --> 00:32:15.085
We don't have a softball team.

801
00:32:15.118 --> 00:32:17.221
No, no, about this place.

802
00:32:17.254 --> 00:32:19.657
This... this
well-oiled machine.


803
00:32:19.691 --> 00:32:21.960
We are the cops.

804
00:32:23.695 --> 00:32:25.262
Retired.

805
00:32:25.295 --> 00:32:27.064
But once a cop,
always a cop.


806
00:32:27.097 --> 00:32:28.298
Right, Tommy?

807
00:32:28.332 --> 00:32:29.266
You got that right.

808
00:32:29.299 --> 00:32:30.969
Semper blue.

809
00:32:31.001 --> 00:32:33.470
All you have to do is make
a pick up every day and


810
00:32:33.504 --> 00:32:35.172
bring it back here.

811
00:32:35.205 --> 00:32:36.540
A pick up? (Chuckles)

812
00:32:36.574 --> 00:32:39.009
I assume you don't mean
another teddy bear?


813
00:32:39.042 --> 00:32:40.110
No.

814
00:32:40.143 --> 00:32:43.046
Just the daily haul
from this place.


815
00:32:43.080 --> 00:32:44.181
I don't know.

816
00:32:44.214 --> 00:32:46.216
I mean it seems dangerous.

817
00:32:46.250 --> 00:32:49.353
Sarah, you're just
the messenger.


818
00:32:49.386 --> 00:32:53.090
No one ever kills the
messenger, right?


819
00:32:53.123 --> 00:32:55.760
I mean if you were a guy,
I'd tell you to grow a pair,


820
00:32:55.793 --> 00:32:57.629
but I think you
have a pair already,


821
00:32:57.662 --> 00:32:59.363
but you just don't know
where they are yet.


822
00:32:59.396 --> 00:33:01.265
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- No, no, no, no,


823
00:33:01.298 --> 00:33:02.901
please,
let me finish here.


824
00:33:02.934 --> 00:33:04.769
You have a conscience.

825
00:33:04.802 --> 00:33:06.771
This jungle of a city
hasn't taken that


826
00:33:06.804 --> 00:33:08.472
away from you yet.

827
00:33:08.505 --> 00:33:12.376
I had a conscience
once, and so did Mr. Danny.


828
00:33:12.409 --> 00:33:16.480
Well, let me allow you
in on a little secret.


829
00:33:16.513 --> 00:33:18.983
No one has ever made it
through this world without


830
00:33:19.017 --> 00:33:20.585
cutting any corners.

831
00:33:20.618 --> 00:33:23.688
Not the homeless guy sleepin'
in front of your buildin',


832
00:33:23.721 --> 00:33:25.255
not the Mayor of
City of New York,


833
00:33:25.289 --> 00:33:27.759
not the richest man on Earth,
and the key is to


834
00:33:27.792 --> 00:33:31.796
cut the right corners and
not push your luck.


835
00:33:31.829 --> 00:33:34.298
We are offering you
gainful employment here.


836
00:33:34.331 --> 00:33:36.500
Low risk, high reward.

837
00:33:36.533 --> 00:33:38.368
You may get arrested
once or twice, but that's


838
00:33:38.402 --> 00:33:40.038
par for the course.

839
00:33:40.070 --> 00:33:43.908
But nobody's gonna hurt
and that's not a small thing.


840
00:33:48.512 --> 00:33:50.280
(Siren wailing in
background)


841
00:33:50.314 --> 00:33:52.717
So I've decided I'm no
longer gonna work for


842
00:33:52.750 --> 00:33:54.384
Mr. Danny anymore.

843
00:33:54.418 --> 00:33:56.086
Just too wrong.

844
00:33:56.119 --> 00:33:58.088
LUNA: So are you back to the
whole quitting thing again?


845
00:33:58.121 --> 00:33:59.256
SARAH:
You mean like leave town?


846
00:33:59.289 --> 00:34:01.325
- LUNA: Yeah.
- SARAH: No.


847
00:34:01.358 --> 00:34:03.628
I just need to find
a respectable job.


848
00:34:03.661 --> 00:34:06.163
I guess my career
as a waitress is inevitable.


849
00:34:06.196 --> 00:34:07.832
You mean nanny.

850
00:34:07.865 --> 00:34:09.067
Like baby-sitting?

851
00:34:09.099 --> 00:34:12.737
Sarah, haven't you heard nanny
is the new waitressing?


852
00:34:12.770 --> 00:34:14.973
(Chuckles) Alright.

853
00:34:15.006 --> 00:34:16.373
(Chuckling)

854
00:34:16.406 --> 00:34:18.108
DANNY:
Hey.


855
00:34:18.141 --> 00:34:19.176
How we doin'?

856
00:34:19.209 --> 00:34:20.277
Business is goin'
great, boss.


857
00:34:20.310 --> 00:34:22.013
- There is a lot of orders comin' in.
- Oh yeah.


858
00:34:22.046 --> 00:34:23.815
The phone's ringin'
off the hook.


859
00:34:23.848 --> 00:34:24.816
What about that girl?

860
00:34:24.849 --> 00:34:27.685
- She called me back?
- Not that I'm aware, no.


861
00:34:27.719 --> 00:34:30.088
Keep an eye on her,
and get me a cup of coffee,


862
00:34:30.120 --> 00:34:32.724
and hurry back.

863
00:34:32.757 --> 00:34:37.127
(♪♪♪)

864
00:34:41.131 --> 00:34:43.166
I assume that
you're like every other


865
00:34:43.200 --> 00:34:46.403
socially-awkward
millennial and you spend


866
00:34:46.436 --> 00:34:48.873
the vast majority of your
time with your face buried


867
00:34:48.906 --> 00:34:50.708
in front of your...
your iPhone, right?


868
00:34:50.742 --> 00:34:53.276
(Chuckling) Pretty
much, except I actually


869
00:34:53.310 --> 00:34:54.378
don't have an iPhone.

870
00:34:54.411 --> 00:34:56.146
I have a Blackberry.

871
00:34:56.179 --> 00:34:57.849
A Blackberry.

872
00:34:57.882 --> 00:34:59.449
Oy.

873
00:34:59.483 --> 00:35:00.852
Well, listen,
my kid's not like that.


874
00:35:00.885 --> 00:35:04.722
You see, she spends most
of her time with her face


875
00:35:04.756 --> 00:35:07.224
buried in books.

876
00:35:08.593 --> 00:35:11.161
That's a novel
concept, isn't it?


877
00:35:13.296 --> 00:35:16.500
She's not a whore,
my Heather.


878
00:35:16.533 --> 00:35:18.903
I think that's great, Gail.
(Chuckling)


879
00:35:20.504 --> 00:35:22.040
So I'm just
gonna be... I'm gonna be


880
00:35:22.073 --> 00:35:25.143
brutally upfront and
honest with you,


881
00:35:25.175 --> 00:35:27.879
and if you have a problem with
anything I'm about to say,


882
00:35:27.912 --> 00:35:30.547
then you can just get the
fuck out of my house.


883
00:35:30.581 --> 00:35:32.083
Of course.

884
00:35:32.116 --> 00:35:36.520
Please do not use any foul
language in front of my kid.


885
00:35:36.554 --> 00:35:38.422
If I find out you're
doing that, I'm gonna take


886
00:35:38.455 --> 00:35:41.592
your mouth and I'm gonna
drag it out in the street.


887
00:35:41.626 --> 00:35:43.493
Y... and if you bring your
boyfriend up here and


888
00:35:43.527 --> 00:35:46.964
I find out that you guys
are sucking or fucking,


889
00:35:46.998 --> 00:35:49.266
I don't know what
you people do,


890
00:35:49.299 --> 00:35:51.234
I'm gonna break both your legs.

891
00:35:51.268 --> 00:35:52.603
And drugs?

892
00:35:52.637 --> 00:35:55.272
Don't even get me
started on that!


893
00:35:57.008 --> 00:35:59.110
Do you use Molly?

894
00:35:59.143 --> 00:36:01.478
Sorry, who's Molly?

895
00:36:01.511 --> 00:36:03.547
If you bring any drugs
into my house that


896
00:36:03.581 --> 00:36:05.183
are stronger than a baby
aspirin,


897
00:36:05.215 --> 00:36:06.651
I'll break both your legs.

898
00:36:06.684 --> 00:36:10.287
Then, and only then, will I take
you to the police.


899
00:36:10.320 --> 00:36:13.124
Have I made myself
perfectly clear?


900
00:36:13.157 --> 00:36:14.158
Clear as a bell.

901
00:36:14.192 --> 00:36:15.525
(Chuckling)

902
00:36:17.028 --> 00:36:18.930
Welcome to my house.

903
00:36:21.032 --> 00:36:22.066
I'm done with my homework.

904
00:36:22.100 --> 00:36:23.134
Awesome.

905
00:36:23.167 --> 00:36:24.234
And are you girls hungry?

906
00:36:24.267 --> 00:36:25.670
Uh, tough question.

907
00:36:25.703 --> 00:36:28.139
(Chuckles) Okay, let
me re-phrase that.


908
00:36:28.172 --> 00:36:30.208
Um, are you girls hungry?

909
00:36:30.240 --> 00:36:32.275
Right now, all I do
is binge and purge.


910
00:36:32.309 --> 00:36:33.911
That's not a good
idea, Heather.


911
00:36:33.945 --> 00:36:36.147
Um, Lola, doesn't
Sarah look fat?


912
00:36:36.180 --> 00:36:37.682
(Chuckling) Totally.

913
00:36:37.715 --> 00:36:39.917
I think she's doing
the binge without the purge.


914
00:36:39.951 --> 00:36:41.586
Total porker,
needs to purge.


915
00:36:41.619 --> 00:36:43.955
- Excuse me?
- Do you wanna get high?


916
00:36:43.988 --> 00:36:45.022
Shit, yeah.

917
00:36:45.056 --> 00:36:46.691
- What are you talking about?
- Get high.


918
00:36:46.724 --> 00:36:48.092
Yeah, I have some Buddha
stick up in my room


919
00:36:48.126 --> 00:36:48.993
some junior high
kid sold me.


920
00:36:49.026 --> 00:36:50.293
Nice.

921
00:36:50.327 --> 00:36:52.697
I think this
conversation is over.


922
00:36:52.730 --> 00:36:54.899
Okay, you're not
into it, that's fine.


923
00:36:54.932 --> 00:36:56.601
Just don't tell
my mom, okay?


924
00:36:56.634 --> 00:36:59.469
She's still pissed that
I got dropped back a grade.


925
00:36:59.503 --> 00:37:00.571
Again.

926
00:37:00.605 --> 00:37:01.639
Fine.

927
00:37:01.672 --> 00:37:03.708
I'm think I'm gonna
dress like a sexy witch


928
00:37:03.741 --> 00:37:04.942
- for Halloween.
- Hmm?


929
00:37:04.976 --> 00:37:09.312
- You know like red lips, big hair, boobs, ass...
- Yeah.


930
00:37:09.346 --> 00:37:10.447
- Everything.
- I love it.


931
00:37:10.480 --> 00:37:12.449
- (Sniffing)
- Wait, what are you doing?


932
00:37:12.482 --> 00:37:13.951
Are you out of your mind?

933
00:37:13.985 --> 00:37:15.553
- Not yet.
- (Chuckling)


934
00:37:15.586 --> 00:37:17.121
- Okay, give me that shit.
- Right on!


935
00:37:17.155 --> 00:37:18.321
No, not right on, okay?

936
00:37:18.355 --> 00:37:20.625
This is ridiculous.

937
00:37:20.658 --> 00:37:24.095
Sarah, how many guys
have you fucked in your


938
00:37:24.128 --> 00:37:25.263
life so far?

939
00:37:25.295 --> 00:37:26.998
Jesus Christ.

940
00:37:27.031 --> 00:37:29.133
- Just curious.
- What?


941
00:37:29.167 --> 00:37:30.134
Aren't you like 14?

942
00:37:30.168 --> 00:37:31.334
15.

943
00:37:31.368 --> 00:37:32.837
I'm not a virgin.

944
00:37:32.870 --> 00:37:34.672
Oh, gross!

945
00:37:34.705 --> 00:37:36.240
Oh, I let two boys
finger me last month, and


946
00:37:36.274 --> 00:37:37.909
then I let one of them
fuck me, but he didn't


947
00:37:37.942 --> 00:37:40.945
- come inside me, so...
- Okay, you need to shut the hell up!


948
00:37:40.978 --> 00:37:43.681
My mom hates it when
babysitters curse around me.


949
00:37:43.714 --> 00:37:45.950
Well, your mom
is delusional. (Chuckling)


950
00:37:45.983 --> 00:37:48.853
I did not understand
why I needed to babysit girls


951
00:37:48.886 --> 00:37:51.689
that were basically my age
and now I do,


952
00:37:51.722 --> 00:37:53.390
and I'm no
longer your babysitter.


953
00:37:53.423 --> 00:37:54.625
Wait, you're leaving?

954
00:37:54.659 --> 00:37:55.660
Correct.

955
00:37:55.693 --> 00:37:56.828
What a pussy.

956
00:37:56.861 --> 00:37:58.029
Don't ever use that word.

957
00:37:58.062 --> 00:37:59.096
What word?

958
00:37:59.130 --> 00:38:00.665
Uh, you know what word.

959
00:38:00.698 --> 00:38:01.666
The... the P-word.

960
00:38:01.699 --> 00:38:03.100
Pussy, pussy, pussy,
pussy, pussy.


961
00:38:03.134 --> 00:38:04.135
Sarah, please don't leave.

962
00:38:04.168 --> 00:38:05.402
I'm so sorry.

963
00:38:05.435 --> 00:38:07.839
I... I know I messed
up, but my mom's gonna


964
00:38:07.872 --> 00:38:09.506
kick my ass for this.

965
00:38:11.576 --> 00:38:16.147
Look, you girls do not need to
grow up so fast, okay?


966
00:38:16.180 --> 00:38:19.283
Just be kids.

967
00:38:19.317 --> 00:38:21.152
You're right.

968
00:38:24.421 --> 00:38:27.091
- Do you wanna do some Molly?
- GIRL: Oh yeah.


969
00:38:27.124 --> 00:38:28.159
Got the fake IDs, bitches.

970
00:38:28.192 --> 00:38:29.660
Let's party!

971
00:38:29.694 --> 00:38:30.628
Oh, you want one?

972
00:38:30.661 --> 00:38:31.796
50 bucks.

973
00:38:31.829 --> 00:38:33.530
(Door squeaking)

974
00:38:33.564 --> 00:38:35.700
I'm in.

975
00:38:35.733 --> 00:38:39.203
Hey, Mr. Tommy, look
what the cat dragged in.


976
00:38:39.237 --> 00:38:42.405
Yeah, you said
she'd be back.


977
00:38:42.439 --> 00:38:44.041
Fuckin' cheesecake,
give me the run.


978
00:38:44.075 --> 00:38:45.042
(Chuckles)

979
00:38:45.076 --> 00:38:48.079
(♪♪♪)

980
00:39:22.046 --> 00:39:25.016
(♪♪♪)

981
00:39:25.049 --> 00:39:29.053
(♪♪♪)

982
00:39:36.027 --> 00:39:39.130
(Rustling)

983
00:39:45.002 --> 00:39:45.903
(Indistinct lyrics in
background)


984
00:39:45.937 --> 00:39:47.004
The money is good.

985
00:39:47.038 --> 00:39:48.072
And it's harmless, right?

986
00:39:48.105 --> 00:39:49.807
I mean nobody's
getting hurt.


987
00:39:49.840 --> 00:39:52.243
A victimless crime if
there ever was one.


988
00:39:52.276 --> 00:39:54.078
Just don't live
above your means.


989
00:39:54.111 --> 00:39:55.746
What do you mean?

990
00:39:55.780 --> 00:39:56.948
Don't flaunt it.

991
00:39:56.981 --> 00:39:58.049
Keep it to yourself.

992
00:39:58.082 --> 00:39:59.750
The last thing you wanna
do is draw attention


993
00:39:59.784 --> 00:40:01.819
to yourself.

994
00:40:01.852 --> 00:40:04.121
So I shouldn't buy that
new apartment, should I?


995
00:40:04.155 --> 00:40:05.323
- (Chuckles)
- Not yet.


996
00:40:05.356 --> 00:40:06.891
(Indistinct chatter)

997
00:40:06.924 --> 00:40:09.260
(♪♪♪)

998
00:40:23.240 --> 00:40:25.242
Troy Remy is one director

999
00:40:25.276 --> 00:40:27.311
that you want to be
obsessed with you.


1000
00:40:27.345 --> 00:40:29.780
I mean have you seen
his last film <i>The Fault Within?</i>


1001
00:40:29.814 --> 00:40:31.182
No.

1002
00:40:31.215 --> 00:40:32.950
It's friggin' intense.

1003
00:40:32.984 --> 00:40:34.352
Uh, is it on Netflix?

1004
00:40:34.385 --> 00:40:36.486
I have no idea,
check it out.


1005
00:40:37.822 --> 00:40:42.860
And at one point, he pulls out
a Blackberry.


1006
00:40:42.893 --> 00:40:44.228
You believe that?

1007
00:40:44.261 --> 00:40:46.197
A fuckin' Blackberry.

1008
00:40:46.230 --> 00:40:48.232
(Indistinct speech)

1009
00:40:48.265 --> 00:40:50.735
Hey, ladies,
what's happening tonight?


1010
00:40:50.768 --> 00:40:52.236
How you doin'?

1011
00:40:52.269 --> 00:40:55.239
- Yeah, no, just...
- Yeah.


1012
00:40:57.608 --> 00:41:02.446
So Troy was wondering if
you might like to join him.


1013
00:41:03.581 --> 00:41:07.852
So why doesn't he
ask me himself?


1014
00:41:07.885 --> 00:41:10.888
MAN 2: Is that really what you
want me to tell him?


1015
00:41:10.921 --> 00:41:12.957
Are you sure?

1016
00:41:12.990 --> 00:41:15.593
Absopositively?

1017
00:41:17.995 --> 00:41:20.297
Okay.

1018
00:41:20.331 --> 00:41:23.434
(Indistinct chatter)

1019
00:41:27.505 --> 00:41:30.207
Right then and there, I
knew this guy was a clown.


1020
00:41:30.241 --> 00:41:32.576
Someone not worth
any of my time.


1021
00:41:36.280 --> 00:41:38.749
(Clears throat) Could you
freshen this for me, sweetie?


1022
00:41:38.783 --> 00:41:40.618
White wine spritzer.

1023
00:41:40.651 --> 00:41:42.787
Heavy on the spritz.

1024
00:41:42.820 --> 00:41:44.922
You want me to get
you another drink?


1025
00:41:44.955 --> 00:41:46.323
Isn't that your job?

1026
00:41:46.357 --> 00:41:47.792
White wine spritzer.

1027
00:41:47.825 --> 00:41:51.362
Um, I can get you another drink,
but it's not my job


1028
00:41:51.395 --> 00:41:54.198
to get you another drink,
sweetie.


1029
00:41:54.231 --> 00:41:55.332
I'll get you another
drink though,


1030
00:41:55.366 --> 00:41:57.668
'cause it's the polite thing
to do.


1031
00:41:57.701 --> 00:42:00.071
Never mind.

1032
00:42:00.104 --> 00:42:02.640
(Clears throat)
Nice dress.


1033
00:42:04.875 --> 00:42:06.811
I still shoot on film.

1034
00:42:06.844 --> 00:42:08.479
Fuck digital.

1035
00:42:08.512 --> 00:42:12.316
- (Chuckles)
- And fuck those YouTube and Snapchat hacks.


1036
00:42:12.349 --> 00:42:15.586
I'm the true heir to
John Ford and Howard Hawks.


1037
00:42:17.888 --> 00:42:20.291
Ladies, I got an idea.

1038
00:42:20.324 --> 00:42:25.296
To me, the real party
is the after-party.


1039
00:42:25.329 --> 00:42:27.298
I think it's time I gave
everyone their walkin' papers


1040
00:42:27.331 --> 00:42:29.467
except for you two.

1041
00:42:29.500 --> 00:42:31.435
No after-party.

1042
00:42:31.469 --> 00:42:34.605
My girl Sarah has three big
auditions tomorrow.


1043
00:42:34.638 --> 00:42:37.208
Two studio features
and an indie.


1044
00:42:39.043 --> 00:42:40.611
That's cool.

1045
00:42:40.644 --> 00:42:42.713
That's cool.

1046
00:42:42.746 --> 00:42:44.648
Live for another day.

1047
00:42:45.883 --> 00:42:47.284
I get it.

1048
00:42:47.318 --> 00:42:49.820
Good luck on
that audition.


1049
00:42:49.854 --> 00:42:51.722
(Indistinct chatter)

1050
00:42:53.791 --> 00:42:55.192
Hey.

1051
00:42:55.226 --> 00:42:56.794
Why are we
leaving so early?


1052
00:42:56.827 --> 00:42:58.662
I thought you said you wanted
him to be obsessed with me.


1053
00:42:58.696 --> 00:43:00.297
And he is.

1054
00:43:00.331 --> 00:43:02.567
But I also want him to
think that other directors


1055
00:43:02.601 --> 00:43:04.268
are obsessed with you.

1056
00:43:04.301 --> 00:43:05.703
Look, if you wanna go
fuck his brains out tonight,


1057
00:43:05.736 --> 00:43:06.704
feel free.

1058
00:43:06.737 --> 00:43:09.073
Go back up there.

1059
00:43:09.106 --> 00:43:11.742
You'll get your chance
with him and he knows it.


1060
00:43:11.775 --> 00:43:14.613
(Siren wailing in distance)

1061
00:43:16.881 --> 00:43:18.315
BOB:
Yeah.


1062
00:43:18.349 --> 00:43:19.618
Hmm.

1063
00:43:19.650 --> 00:43:21.952
If she's as pretty as you
say, you better kick-start


1064
00:43:21.986 --> 00:43:23.787
those moves of yours.

1065
00:43:23.821 --> 00:43:25.156
Otherwise, one of those
Wall Street douche bags


1066
00:43:25.189 --> 00:43:27.992
is gonna pounce on her.

1067
00:43:28.025 --> 00:43:30.094
(Grunting)
What?


1068
00:43:32.263 --> 00:43:36.133
She's not the type that
go for a Wall Street douche bag.


1069
00:43:36.167 --> 00:43:38.035
Don't be so sure of that.

1070
00:43:38.068 --> 00:43:40.304
These girls come from
small town USA


1071
00:43:40.337 --> 00:43:42.574
and they get dollar
signs in their eyes.


1072
00:43:42.607 --> 00:43:44.008
Make your move, Frankie.

1073
00:43:44.041 --> 00:43:46.443
Make your move.

1074
00:43:46.477 --> 00:43:48.145
(Sighs)

1075
00:43:48.179 --> 00:43:49.280
Thank you so much.

1076
00:43:49.313 --> 00:43:50.447
Have a lovely night.

1077
00:43:50.481 --> 00:43:51.815
- (Chuckles)
- Thank you.


1078
00:43:51.849 --> 00:43:52.983
Oh, no, no, no.

1079
00:43:53.017 --> 00:43:54.685
- No way!
- (Chuckles) What?


1080
00:43:54.718 --> 00:43:55.853
I can't let you pay.

1081
00:43:55.886 --> 00:43:57.855
We split it 50/50.

1082
00:43:57.888 --> 00:44:00.659
I pay for all my dates.

1083
00:44:00.691 --> 00:44:03.427
This isn't a date.

1084
00:44:03.460 --> 00:44:06.297
Well, okay, but uh, aren't
you a starving artist?


1085
00:44:06.330 --> 00:44:07.932
You know,
I'm your neighbor.


1086
00:44:07.965 --> 00:44:12.303
- This is my welcome to the neighbor...
- It's okay.


1087
00:44:12.336 --> 00:44:15.005
- Dinner.
- It's okay. (Chuckles)


1088
00:44:15.039 --> 00:44:17.609
(Chuckles)
Seriously.


1089
00:44:17.642 --> 00:44:20.978
Dougie, think our boy
Frankie here is in love.


1090
00:44:21.011 --> 00:44:22.079
DOUGIE:
Oh.


1091
00:44:22.112 --> 00:44:23.147
Oh, shit, that...
(Dougie chuckling)


1092
00:44:23.180 --> 00:44:25.049
I thought it was somethin'
important.


1093
00:44:25.082 --> 00:44:27.084
(Dougie chuckling)
Seriously, Frankie,


1094
00:44:27.117 --> 00:44:28.219
are you in love
with this Sarah girl?


1095
00:44:28.252 --> 00:44:30.988
Frankie, don't answer
these guys, okay?


1096
00:44:31.021 --> 00:44:31.989
BOB:
What?


1097
00:44:32.022 --> 00:44:33.224
What's wrong?

1098
00:44:33.257 --> 00:44:35.125
Because Frankie is sweet
and I don't want you


1099
00:44:35.159 --> 00:44:37.094
guys making fun of him
for being in love and shit


1100
00:44:37.127 --> 00:44:38.295
like that.

1101
00:44:38.329 --> 00:44:40.130
BOB:
Frankie is my boy.


1102
00:44:40.164 --> 00:44:41.633
Right, Frankie,
you my boy?


1103
00:44:41.666 --> 00:44:43.200
Yeah, you're my boy.

1104
00:44:43.234 --> 00:44:44.835
DOUGIE:
Am I anybody's boy?


1105
00:44:44.868 --> 00:44:46.203
- No!
- No!


1106
00:44:47.371 --> 00:44:50.709
Ladies, welcome to
stage combat class.


1107
00:44:50.741 --> 00:44:52.577
Now, it's very important for you
to remember


1108
00:44:52.611 --> 00:44:56.180
two universal
rules to guarantee safety


1109
00:44:56.213 --> 00:44:59.450
at all times during
a stage performance.


1110
00:44:59.483 --> 00:45:03.787
Rule number 1 is to
always, always, always


1111
00:45:03.821 --> 00:45:06.290
make eye contact
with the person


1112
00:45:06.323 --> 00:45:08.025
that you're working with.

1113
00:45:08.058 --> 00:45:10.861
Rule number 2 is
always make sure that


1114
00:45:10.894 --> 00:45:13.764
there's more than adequate
distance between you


1115
00:45:13.797 --> 00:45:16.735
and the actual target
that you're aiming at to


1116
00:45:16.767 --> 00:45:19.336
avoid accidental contact.

1117
00:45:19.370 --> 00:45:20.871
Do I make myself clear?

1118
00:45:20.904 --> 00:45:22.172
(Grunts)

1119
00:45:22.206 --> 00:45:23.907
Eye contact.

1120
00:45:23.941 --> 00:45:25.542
Eye contact.

1121
00:45:25.577 --> 00:45:28.680
- Eye contact.
- I wanna slap you in the face right now.


1122
00:45:30.848 --> 00:45:32.584
Eye contact.

1123
00:45:32.617 --> 00:45:35.654
(Taking deep breaths)

1124
00:45:35.687 --> 00:45:38.422
(Grunting) Ow!

1125
00:45:39.456 --> 00:45:41.492
Okay, remember eye
contact, safe distance


1126
00:45:41.525 --> 00:45:43.227
- from... (Grunting)
- Oh.


1127
00:45:43.260 --> 00:45:45.296
(Overlapping conversation)
JOSIE: It's so soft.


1128
00:45:45.329 --> 00:45:47.331
- (Overlapping conversation)
- (Chuckling)


1129
00:45:47.364 --> 00:45:49.266
JOSIE: Okay, I'd think
twice, like did you...


1130
00:45:53.705 --> 00:45:55.039
"Fie!

1131
00:45:55.072 --> 00:45:56.708
Fie!

1132
00:45:56.741 --> 00:45:58.008
Fie!

1133
00:45:58.042 --> 00:46:01.111
Sword and shield,
in bloody field,


1134
00:46:01.145 --> 00:46:04.882
doth win immortal fame.

1135
00:46:04.915 --> 00:46:09.086
Gallop apace, you
fiery-footed steeds."


1136
00:46:10.722 --> 00:46:12.791
Josette, what say you?

1137
00:46:12.823 --> 00:46:15.359
"Love looks not with
the eyes, But with the mind,


1138
00:46:15.392 --> 00:46:18.697
and therefore is winged Cupid
painted blind,"


1139
00:46:18.730 --> 00:46:21.265
A Midsummer Night's Dream,
Act I, Scene I.


1140
00:46:23.434 --> 00:46:26.738
(Clears throat)
"All the world is a stage,


1141
00:46:26.771 --> 00:46:29.406
and all the men and
women merely players.


1142
00:46:29.440 --> 00:46:32.076
They have their exits
and their entrances,


1143
00:46:32.109 --> 00:46:35.312
and one man in his time
plays many parts,"


1144
00:46:35.346 --> 00:46:38.382
As You Like It,
Act II, Scene VII.


1145
00:46:39.883 --> 00:46:41.852
"Doubt thou the stars
are fire,


1146
00:46:41.885 --> 00:46:44.922
doubt that the sun doth move,
doubt truth to be a liar,


1147
00:46:44.955 --> 00:46:46.825
but never doubt I love."

1148
00:46:46.857 --> 00:46:49.193
Hamlet, Act II, Scene II.

1149
00:46:52.296 --> 00:46:54.733
"Shall I compare thee
to a summer's day?


1150
00:46:54.766 --> 00:46:57.569
Thou art more lovely
and more temperate.


1151
00:46:57.602 --> 00:47:00.304
Rough winds do shake
the darling buds of May,


1152
00:47:00.337 --> 00:47:03.374
And summer's lease hath
all too short a date."


1153
00:47:03.407 --> 00:47:05.008
Sonnet 18.

1154
00:47:06.143 --> 00:47:09.748
I thank thee, fair
and gentle, Sarah.


1155
00:47:12.883 --> 00:47:15.085
- So how long have you lived here?
- (Indistinct lyrics in background)


1156
00:47:15.119 --> 00:47:17.521
Seems like forever and a day.

1157
00:47:17.555 --> 00:47:20.558
I came here with a dream
in my head,


1158
00:47:20.592 --> 00:47:23.394
and stars in my eyes,
and I was gonna be the next...


1159
00:47:23.427 --> 00:47:26.598
You fill in the blank,
the next big something.


1160
00:47:26.631 --> 00:47:27.931
Show business?

1161
00:47:27.965 --> 00:47:31.168
I was a singer,
dancer, actress,


1162
00:47:31.201 --> 00:47:35.172
comedienne, but mostly
I was a waitress.


1163
00:47:35.205 --> 00:47:37.508
And then I met
my first husband.


1164
00:47:37.541 --> 00:47:40.578
It happened he was someone
else's husband at the same time


1165
00:47:40.612 --> 00:47:42.814
and he swept me off
my feet and I never had to


1166
00:47:42.847 --> 00:47:44.948
work another
day in my life.


1167
00:47:44.982 --> 00:47:46.584
So what was New
York like back then?


1168
00:47:46.618 --> 00:47:49.253
I've heard so much about
it from my grandpa.


1169
00:47:49.286 --> 00:47:53.390
Oh, better in some ways
and worse in others.


1170
00:47:53.424 --> 00:47:56.861
(Sighs) Just like
everything else in life.


1171
00:47:56.895 --> 00:48:00.765
The polo grounds,
the old Penn Station,


1172
00:48:00.799 --> 00:48:03.233
the uh,...

1173
00:48:03.267 --> 00:48:06.503
...Fillmore East,
the Bellmore Cafeteria,


1174
00:48:06.537 --> 00:48:10.441
the Rivoli Theaters,
they're all gone.


1175
00:48:13.912 --> 00:48:15.979
Here, I'm gonna
show you something?


1176
00:48:16.013 --> 00:48:18.949
Hey, could you recommend
a decent laundry service?


1177
00:48:18.982 --> 00:48:21.952
♪ <i>...you anymore...</i> ♪

1178
00:48:21.985 --> 00:48:25.122
(Indistinct lyrics
in background)


1179
00:48:26.825 --> 00:48:29.594
So how about
you and Frankie?


1180
00:48:29.627 --> 00:48:31.395
Me and Frankie?

1181
00:48:31.428 --> 00:48:34.131
Um... Don't worry,
intra-apartment dating


1182
00:48:34.164 --> 00:48:36.467
is not forbidden.

1183
00:48:36.500 --> 00:48:41.071
No, uh, I mean he's nice
I guess, but we're not dating.


1184
00:48:41.104 --> 00:48:43.073
I didn't come to Manhattan to
find a husband.


1185
00:48:43.106 --> 00:48:44.642
Who said anything
about a husband?


1186
00:48:44.676 --> 00:48:46.543
(Gasps) Look.

1187
00:48:46.578 --> 00:48:47.912
Look at that.

1188
00:48:47.946 --> 00:48:49.112
- (Sarah chuckles)
- HELENA: Do you recognize that handsome face?


1189
00:48:49.146 --> 00:48:50.514
SARAH:
(Sarah chuckles) Grandpa.


1190
00:48:50.547 --> 00:48:52.617
That is definitely
my grandpa.


1191
00:48:52.650 --> 00:48:54.017
Sure is. (Chuckling)

1192
00:48:54.051 --> 00:48:55.352
Oh, I miss him.

1193
00:48:55.385 --> 00:48:56.654
Oh.

1194
00:48:56.688 --> 00:48:59.591
(Phone ringing)

1195
00:49:03.126 --> 00:49:06.096
(Taking deep breaths)

1196
00:49:07.264 --> 00:49:08.566
Hello.

1197
00:49:08.600 --> 00:49:11.803
I got you a meeting today
with Troy Remy today at 9:00.


1198
00:49:11.836 --> 00:49:13.370
Wait, 9:00?

1199
00:49:13.403 --> 00:49:14.839
Shit, that's
like right now.


1200
00:49:14.873 --> 00:49:17.575
9:00 p.m.

1201
00:49:17.609 --> 00:49:19.276
Oh, tonight?

1202
00:49:19.309 --> 00:49:21.545
ALESSANDRA (On the phone): <i>Mmhmm, it's
at the loft we were at the other night.</i>


1203
00:49:21.579 --> 00:49:25.850
<i>Get there early and</i>
uh, oh, wear something hot.


1204
00:49:25.884 --> 00:49:26.885
Hot.

1205
00:49:26.918 --> 00:49:28.118
Got ya.

1206
00:49:28.151 --> 00:49:30.153
Fucking hot.

1207
00:49:30.187 --> 00:49:32.222
I don't think I have anything
that's fuckin' hot.


1208
00:49:32.256 --> 00:49:35.994
Then get something
fucking hot.


1209
00:49:36.026 --> 00:49:38.161
Jesus Christ,
(Indistinct whispering)


1210
00:49:40.832 --> 00:49:41.966
Oh, what the
fuck is in this?


1211
00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:44.167
Jesus Christ.

1212
00:49:45.904 --> 00:49:48.138
(Traffic whooshing
in distance)


1213
00:49:48.171 --> 00:49:50.642
Grandpa? (Chuckling)

1214
00:49:50.675 --> 00:49:51.910
(Kissing)

1215
00:49:51.943 --> 00:49:53.544
What are you doing here?

1216
00:49:53.578 --> 00:49:55.013
I came to see you.

1217
00:49:55.045 --> 00:49:56.513
(Chuckles)
Why didn't you tell me?


1218
00:49:56.547 --> 00:49:58.415
I wanted to
surprise you, honey.


1219
00:49:58.448 --> 00:50:00.217
(Chuckling) Oh.

1220
00:50:00.250 --> 00:50:01.886
(Kissing)
You're looking great.


1221
00:50:01.920 --> 00:50:04.054
Oh, it so, so good
to see you, grandpa.


1222
00:50:04.087 --> 00:50:05.023
Helena's gonna be really
excited, too.


1223
00:50:05.055 --> 00:50:06.189
- Come on.
- Thank you.


1224
00:50:06.223 --> 00:50:07.792
- Let's go in.
- Thank you, honey.


1225
00:50:07.825 --> 00:50:08.927
(Chuckling)

1226
00:50:10.060 --> 00:50:11.528
Yeah, honey, you seem to be
taking well


1227
00:50:11.563 --> 00:50:13.831
- to this city, you know?
- (Chuckling)


1228
00:50:13.865 --> 00:50:15.900
Yeah, I've made some cool
friends and


1229
00:50:15.934 --> 00:50:17.167
I'm starting to really
feel like I'm part


1230
00:50:17.200 --> 00:50:20.337
- of the fabric, you know?
- Uh, well.


1231
00:50:20.370 --> 00:50:23.340
Maybe I'll take grandma down
here for a long weekend.


1232
00:50:23.373 --> 00:50:26.143
(Chuckles) Just take her to s...
a musical or these things.


1233
00:50:26.176 --> 00:50:27.477
That would be awesome.

1234
00:50:27.511 --> 00:50:29.212
She would love that.

1235
00:50:29.246 --> 00:50:32.215
Get tickets to The
Producers, please.


1236
00:50:32.249 --> 00:50:34.084
Well, that's going
to be tough, grandpa.


1237
00:50:34.117 --> 00:50:35.820
The Producers
closed years ago.


1238
00:50:35.853 --> 00:50:37.354
(Laughing)

1239
00:50:37.387 --> 00:50:40.390
- That all I know about Broadway.
- (Laughing) Just a sec.


1240
00:50:40.424 --> 00:50:42.594
- (Chuckling)
- Where are you goin' now?


1241
00:50:42.627 --> 00:50:44.428
(Sarah chuckling)

1242
00:50:44.461 --> 00:50:46.898
HELENA: And I made you some
of my famous split pea soup.


1243
00:50:46.931 --> 00:50:49.499
- Oh.
- SARAH: Thank you.


1244
00:50:49.533 --> 00:50:51.736
I must be dreaming.

1245
00:50:51.769 --> 00:50:53.671
You haven't changed a bit.

1246
00:50:53.705 --> 00:50:55.807
You always were
a great liar.


1247
00:50:55.840 --> 00:50:58.342
Seeing my granddaughter
made my day


1248
00:50:58.375 --> 00:51:01.579
and you're icing on
top of the cake, honey.


1249
00:51:01.613 --> 00:51:03.881
Oh, flattery will
get you everywhere.


1250
00:51:03.915 --> 00:51:05.215
Oh, thank you.

1251
00:51:05.248 --> 00:51:06.985
So how long has it been
since you guys have


1252
00:51:07.018 --> 00:51:08.052
seen each other?

1253
00:51:08.086 --> 00:51:10.253
It was sometime
in the '70s.


1254
00:51:10.287 --> 00:51:12.023
Nixon was President I think.

1255
00:51:12.056 --> 00:51:12.991
(Chuckles)
Abe Lincoln I think.


1256
00:51:13.024 --> 00:51:13.925
- (Chuckling)
- Stop it.


1257
00:51:13.958 --> 00:51:15.392
It was 1972.

1258
00:51:15.425 --> 00:51:17.662
I remember because
I was marching in the anti-war


1259
00:51:17.695 --> 00:51:20.632
protest that day and
you took me to dinner


1260
00:51:20.665 --> 00:51:21.833
in Little Italy that night.

1261
00:51:21.866 --> 00:51:24.669
Right, I remember.

1262
00:51:24.702 --> 00:51:29.073
Sh... she represented every
lost cause in the planet.


1263
00:51:29.107 --> 00:51:30.440
(Chuckling)

1264
00:51:30.474 --> 00:51:32.043
How is your wife?

1265
00:51:32.076 --> 00:51:34.846
She's great, thank you.

1266
00:51:34.879 --> 00:51:37.115
She must be an
amazing woman.


1267
00:51:37.147 --> 00:51:41.184
(Chuckling)
She is to take care of me.


1268
00:51:41.218 --> 00:51:44.856
How about I take you two
out for a bite to eat, okay?


1269
00:51:44.889 --> 00:51:47.257
See if my favorite
restaurant's still open.


1270
00:51:47.290 --> 00:51:49.027
- Oops.
- Ruggiero's.


1271
00:51:49.060 --> 00:51:50.327
(Chuckling) I'm sorry, grandpa.

1272
00:51:50.360 --> 00:51:51.763
I uh, I've got a thing
tonight, I should


1273
00:51:51.796 --> 00:51:54.164
really start
getting ready.


1274
00:51:54.197 --> 00:51:56.333
Helena, how about
you, honey?


1275
00:51:56.366 --> 00:51:57.835
I... I have got
something, too.


1276
00:51:57.869 --> 00:51:59.403
I think I should go.

1277
00:51:59.436 --> 00:52:02.439
That's great, you
both blowin' me off.


1278
00:52:03.574 --> 00:52:05.643
Take care of yourself.

1279
00:52:08.713 --> 00:52:10.213
Thank you.

1280
00:52:10.247 --> 00:52:12.315
Thank you for taking
care of my kid.


1281
00:52:12.349 --> 00:52:13.885
(Chuckles)

1282
00:52:30.902 --> 00:52:32.136
(Indistinct lyrics in
background)


1283
00:52:32.170 --> 00:52:35.073
One thing I know is chemistry.

1284
00:52:35.106 --> 00:52:37.909
Kinetic chemistry.

1285
00:52:37.942 --> 00:52:41.813
Whether in cinema
or in real life.


1286
00:52:41.846 --> 00:52:44.015
It's chemistry.

1287
00:52:44.048 --> 00:52:46.684
I like our energy.

1288
00:52:46.718 --> 00:52:49.020
I like you.

1289
00:52:49.053 --> 00:52:52.890
Um, s... s... so um,

1290
00:52:52.924 --> 00:52:54.992
are you doing any
new movie soon?


1291
00:52:55.026 --> 00:52:57.028
I'm shooting five new
movies soon, just like


1292
00:52:57.061 --> 00:52:58.830
Fassbinder did.

1293
00:52:58.863 --> 00:53:01.199
40 movies in 13 years.

1294
00:53:01.231 --> 00:53:03.266
I just keep goin',
I can't stop.


1295
00:53:03.300 --> 00:53:06.503
Cinema is like
a drug to me.


1296
00:53:06.536 --> 00:53:09.207
You're like a drug to me.

1297
00:53:09.239 --> 00:53:13.144
- (Indistinct lyrics in background)
- Um.


1298
00:53:13.177 --> 00:53:16.114
Uh, uh, what's your
next movie about?


1299
00:53:16.147 --> 00:53:17.815
It's about everything.

1300
00:53:17.849 --> 00:53:20.752
It's about this
beautiful girl.


1301
00:53:20.785 --> 00:53:25.322
And she's hot, she's sexy,
and she's very pretty.


1302
00:53:27.658 --> 00:53:29.894
You know what
I mean, right?


1303
00:53:29.927 --> 00:53:31.461
Yeah.

1304
00:53:31.495 --> 00:53:32.663
And her smile.

1305
00:53:32.697 --> 00:53:37.034
Wow, her smile was made
for the big screen.


1306
00:53:38.368 --> 00:53:43.306
And her eyes, they're
sultry, smoky,...


1307
00:53:45.375 --> 00:53:48.278
...so sexy.

1308
00:53:48.311 --> 00:53:52.116
Her eyes, they
are so deep.


1309
00:53:52.150 --> 00:53:54.752
Deeper than any ocean.

1310
00:53:54.786 --> 00:53:59.757
Atlantic, Pacific, Indian.

1311
00:53:59.791 --> 00:54:04.095
So deep, you just
get lost in them.


1312
00:54:10.635 --> 00:54:12.170
Do... do you
have a headache?


1313
00:54:12.203 --> 00:54:13.503
No.

1314
00:54:13.537 --> 00:54:16.373
This... it's just something to
take the edge off.


1315
00:54:16.406 --> 00:54:17.775
Trust me.

1316
00:54:17.809 --> 00:54:20.477
It's really good.

1317
00:54:20.510 --> 00:54:23.413
(Indistinct lyrics)

1318
00:54:43.167 --> 00:54:45.236

1322
00:55:19.837 --> 00:55:22.940
(Phone ringing)

1323
00:55:28.913 --> 00:55:30.380
Hi.

1324
00:55:30.413 --> 00:55:33.184
TROY (On the phone):
<i>Sarah, hi.</i>


1325
00:55:33.217 --> 00:55:36.020
Troy, hi.

1326
00:55:36.053 --> 00:55:38.256
<i>I wanna apologize</i> for running
out on you this morning.


1327
00:55:38.289 --> 00:55:39.957
I had an early meeting
with some money guys


1328
00:55:39.991 --> 00:55:42.026
who are in
town just for today.


1329
00:55:42.059 --> 00:55:43.493
I couldn't blow them off.

1330
00:55:43.526 --> 00:55:44.729
Yeah.

1331
00:55:44.762 --> 00:55:48.232
Um, yeah, no,
I... I understand.


1332
00:55:48.266 --> 00:55:49.499
You okay?

1333
00:55:49.532 --> 00:55:52.169
Um, yeah.

1334
00:55:52.203 --> 00:55:55.239
Yeah, yeah,
I'm... I'm fine.


1335
00:55:55.273 --> 00:55:58.943
Anyway, I'm free right now
and I just wanted to say hi.


1336
00:55:59.977 --> 00:56:02.079
And I wanna drop
off your wallet.


1337
00:56:02.113 --> 00:56:04.015
I don't know if you know, but
you left it at my place.


1338
00:56:04.048 --> 00:56:05.883
Oh shit, my wallet?

1339
00:56:05.917 --> 00:56:07.051
Fuck.

1340
00:56:07.084 --> 00:56:09.720
Shit, I had no
idea I'd lost it.


1341
00:56:09.754 --> 00:56:12.657
No worries,
I've been there.


1342
00:56:12.690 --> 00:56:14.358
I'll swing by in
an hour, okay?


1343
00:56:14.392 --> 00:56:16.526
Um.

1344
00:56:19.397 --> 00:56:21.065
(Indistinct lyrics in
background)


1345
00:56:21.098 --> 00:56:23.367
So how was your meeting
today?


1346
00:56:23.401 --> 00:56:24.534
It went great.

1347
00:56:24.568 --> 00:56:27.571
These people, they got
more money than God


1348
00:56:27.605 --> 00:56:29.407
and they're big
fans of my work.


1349
00:56:29.439 --> 00:56:30.741
Awesome. (Chuckles)

1350
00:56:30.775 --> 00:56:31.742
That's really cool.

1351
00:56:31.776 --> 00:56:34.278
Yeah, yeah it is.

1352
00:56:34.312 --> 00:56:36.614
I know this sounds lame,
but I texted my mom


1353
00:56:36.647 --> 00:56:40.251
in Detroit this morning and
I told her all about you.


1354
00:56:40.284 --> 00:56:43.354
Seriously?

1355
00:56:43.387 --> 00:56:44.689
Seriously.

1356
00:56:44.722 --> 00:56:46.357
Wow.

1357
00:56:46.390 --> 00:56:47.658
I know.

1358
00:56:47.692 --> 00:56:49.660
That's heavy. (Chuckles)

1359
00:56:49.694 --> 00:56:51.963
Yeah, moms are heavy.

1360
00:56:51.996 --> 00:56:56.267
Anyway, I just wanna
keep seeing you.


1361
00:56:56.300 --> 00:56:58.903
I wanna know if
that's possible.


1362
00:56:58.936 --> 00:57:02.273
Um, sure.

1363
00:57:02.306 --> 00:57:05.376
Um, we can keep
hanging out and uh,


1364
00:57:05.409 --> 00:57:07.845
I'd love to work with
you on a film.


1365
00:57:07.878 --> 00:57:09.914
Are you seein'
anyone right now?


1366
00:57:09.947 --> 00:57:12.116
Uh, not really.

1367
00:57:16.287 --> 00:57:19.190
Sarah, all I'm asking
for is your time.


1368
00:57:19.223 --> 00:57:21.524
Uh.

1369
00:57:23.160 --> 00:57:27.098
You had a great time
last night, too, right?


1370
00:57:28.299 --> 00:57:30.835
I don't really remember
a lot from last night.


1371
00:57:30.868 --> 00:57:33.437
Trust me, it was a good.

1372
00:57:33.471 --> 00:57:36.374
It was all good.

1373

- Shit.
- Convention Center.


1381
00:58:29.660 --> 00:58:31.929
I am off the duty.

1382
00:58:31.962 --> 00:58:33.597
- (Clears throat)
- Come on!


1383
00:58:33.631 --> 00:58:35.533
Javits Convention Center.

1384
00:58:35.566 --> 00:58:36.967
Javits Convention Center.

1385
00:58:37.001 --> 00:58:39.870
Yeah, I hear you
first time, okay?


1386
00:58:39.904 --> 00:58:41.272
There nothing wrong with
my hearing, but there


1387
00:58:41.305 --> 00:58:43.474
is something wrong
with your hearing.


1388
00:58:43.507 --> 00:58:44.875
I am off the duty.

1389
00:58:44.909 --> 00:58:47.511
I am taking a break.

1390
00:58:47.545 --> 00:58:50.981
Maybe this will get
you back on the duty.


1391
00:58:51.015 --> 00:58:52.316
You are stupid.

1392
00:58:52.349 --> 00:58:53.551
I don't need your money.

1393
00:58:53.584 --> 00:58:55.953
I am trying to eat
my lunch and take a break.


1394
00:58:55.986 --> 00:58:59.623
Take the Uber, mister,
the Uber, okay?


1395
00:58:59.657 --> 00:59:01.325
- Oh yeah?
- Yes.


1396
00:59:01.358 --> 00:59:02.960
Oh yes.

1397
00:59:02.993 --> 00:59:06.330
Maybe the taxi commission
would like to know


1398
00:59:06.363 --> 00:59:08.365
that you won't
take me to the freakin'

fuck stick, okay?

How would you like to go
to the Ass Bangers Convention


1403
00:59:16.006 --> 00:59:17.041
on Rikers Island?

1404
00:59:17.074 --> 00:59:19.076
Now, get the fuck out.

1405
00:59:19.110 --> 00:59:20.044
Alright.

1406
00:59:20.077 --> 00:59:21.779
Get the fuck out of here.

1407
00:59:21.812 --> 00:59:24.181
Douche bag.

1408
00:59:24.215 --> 00:59:26.350
Fuckin' idiot.

1409
00:59:29.620 --> 00:59:31.188
(Sighing)

1410
00:59:31.222 --> 00:59:33.124
You're going there, really?

1411
00:59:33.157 --> 00:59:34.458
I'm going there really.

1412
00:59:34.492 --> 00:59:36.327
You've already gone there.

1413
00:59:36.360 --> 00:59:37.361
I've already gone there.

1414
00:59:37.394 --> 00:59:39.330
Yeah, I've already
gone there.


1415
00:59:39.363 --> 00:59:41.198
I am really going there.

1416
00:59:41.232 --> 00:59:43.734
You're really going there.

1417
00:59:43.767 --> 00:59:45.002
I'm already here.

1418
00:59:45.035 --> 00:59:46.670
You're already here.

1419
00:59:46.704 --> 00:59:47.671
(Clapping) Bravo.

1420
00:59:47.705 --> 00:59:48.706
Oh my God.

1421
00:59:48.739 --> 00:59:49.740
Oh, beautiful, beautiful.

1422
00:59:49.773 --> 00:59:51.008
Hey.

1423
00:59:51.041 --> 00:59:52.743
Hey, hey,
unintelligent talking.


1424
00:59:52.776 --> 00:59:53.844
Quiet.

1425
00:59:53.878 --> 00:59:55.212
That was beautiful, Luna.

1426
00:59:55.246 --> 00:59:56.847
Beautiful!

1427
00:59:56.881 --> 00:59:58.716
You know, Meisner
would be proud.


1428
00:59:58.749 --> 00:59:59.850
Thanks, Barry.

1429
00:59:59.884 --> 01:00:03.187
You're very welcome.

1430
01:00:03.220 --> 01:00:05.089
Philip. (Sighing)

1431
01:00:05.122 --> 01:00:06.524
I didn't believe you
for two seconds,


1432
01:00:06.558 --> 01:00:07.725
let alone one.

1433
01:00:07.758 --> 01:00:09.594
Thanks, Barry.

1434
01:00:09.628 --> 01:00:10.761
Yeah.

1435
01:00:10.794 --> 01:00:13.464
I heard Starbucks
is hiring.


1436
01:00:14.599 --> 01:00:17.101
Sarah, front and center.

1437
01:00:26.710 --> 01:00:28.979
Take off your clothes.

1438
01:00:29.013 --> 01:00:31.616
I beg your pardon?

1439
01:00:31.650 --> 01:00:34.251
Take the cotton balls
out of your ears


1440
01:00:34.285 --> 01:00:36.520
and take off
your clothes.


1441
01:00:36.555 --> 01:00:40.224
Um, Barry... uh,
Mr.Homburg.


1442
01:00:40.257 --> 01:00:42.193
(Clears throat)

1443
01:00:42.226 --> 01:00:45.496
Do you call yourself
an actress?


1444
01:00:45.529 --> 01:00:46.764
Yes.

1445
01:00:46.797 --> 01:00:49.366
Show us you're an actress.

1446
01:00:49.400 --> 01:00:53.938
Take off your clothes
and show us your instrument.


1447
01:00:53.971 --> 01:00:58.943
- Um, Barry, I... I... I really don't...
- Excuse me.


1448
01:00:58.976 --> 01:01:00.978
How could you be a real
actress if you can't get naked


1449
01:01:01.011 --> 01:01:03.714
in front of the world?

1450
01:01:03.747 --> 01:01:06.183
Um, I... I... I don't know.

1451
01:01:06.217 --> 01:01:10.120
Look if you're an actress,
you can't be afraid ugh,


1452
01:01:10.154 --> 01:01:12.923
to express naked emotions,
yeah, the...


1453
01:01:12.957 --> 01:01:16.827
the naked body,
the naked truth.


1454
01:01:16.860 --> 01:01:18.762
So take off your fucking
clothes right now!


1455
01:01:18.796 --> 01:01:20.864
Barry, please. (Crying)

1456
01:01:22.701 --> 01:01:23.934
Hey, hey, don't...
don't look...


1457
01:01:23.968 --> 01:01:25.570
Don't look at them,
look at me.


1458
01:01:25.604 --> 01:01:27.071
(Whistling) Over here.

1459
01:01:27.104 --> 01:01:29.073
(Barry whistling)
Right here.


1460
01:01:29.106 --> 01:01:30.374
Now, Josie took off her
clothes in class,


1461
01:01:30.407 --> 01:01:31.643
didn't you, Josie?

1462
01:01:31.676 --> 01:01:34.713
It was uh, liberating?

1463
01:01:34.745 --> 01:01:36.681
Yeah, it was
liberating, see?


1464
01:01:36.715 --> 01:01:37.682
And so did Jasmine.

1465
01:01:37.716 --> 01:01:38.683
Didn't you, Jasmine?

1466
01:01:38.717 --> 01:01:40.351
I have an amazing bod.

1467
01:01:40.384 --> 01:01:42.386
Just back off, asshole!

1468
01:01:44.054 --> 01:01:45.356
What did you
just say to me?


1469
01:01:45.389 --> 01:01:46.924
There are plenty of
girls at this school


1470
01:01:46.957 --> 01:01:49.293
who don't seem to mind you
brow-beating them into


1471
01:01:49.326 --> 01:01:53.030
getting naked for you, but
Sarah is not one of them.


1472
01:01:53.063 --> 01:01:54.465
(Scoffs) I understand.

1473
01:01:54.498 --> 01:01:56.701
Both of you, get the fuck out of
my class, right now.


1474
01:01:56.735 --> 01:01:57.801
You fucking babies,
both of you.


1475
01:01:57.835 --> 01:01:59.203
You know something,
Barry Homburg?


1476
01:01:59.236 --> 01:02:00.605
Yeah, a lot more than
you do, you little prick.


1477
01:02:00.639 --> 01:02:02.406
Yeah, I know this, you've been
teaching here too long.


1478
01:02:02.439 --> 01:02:03.907
Oh yeah?

1479
01:02:03.941 --> 01:02:05.776
Didn't you start out to be
an actor or a director,


1480
01:02:05.809 --> 01:02:07.878
but it didn't work
out for you, did it?


1481
01:02:07.911 --> 01:02:09.179
So you can't stand
the fact that


1482
01:02:09.213 --> 01:02:11.081
you're a fucking failure,
bitch!


1483
01:02:11.115 --> 01:02:13.851
Hey, fuck you and get
the fuck out of my class!


1484
01:02:13.884 --> 01:02:15.452
Come on, Sarah.

1485
01:02:15.486 --> 01:02:17.488
- Let's blow this popsicle stand.
- Thank you.


1486
01:02:17.521 --> 01:02:20.057
And don't expect to be
asked back for second year!


1487
01:02:20.090 --> 01:02:21.792
I'll tell you that
right the fuck now!


1488
01:02:21.825 --> 01:02:24.161
The cops are gonna love
hearing about all


1489
01:02:24.194 --> 01:02:27.565
the underage kids here you
ply with booze, and weed,


1490
01:02:27.599 --> 01:02:29.366
and blow, Barry.

1491
01:02:29.400 --> 01:02:30.534
Get out!

1492
01:02:30.568 --> 01:02:31.770
Hear up!

1493
01:02:31.802 --> 01:02:33.404
Vice squad.

1494
01:02:33.437 --> 01:02:34.773
Vice squad, baby!

1495
01:02:34.805 --> 01:02:36.307
BARRY:
Vice squad, my ass.


1496
01:02:36.340 --> 01:02:37.308
Bring 'em on!

1497
01:02:37.341 --> 01:02:38.309
Bring on the cops.

1498
01:02:38.342 --> 01:02:39.310
I don't give a shit.

1499
01:02:39.343 --> 01:02:40.177
What am I doin'?

1500
01:02:40.210 --> 01:02:42.880
I'm only fuckin'
teaching how to be free.


1501
01:02:42.913 --> 01:02:44.048
Free in this class, right?

1502
01:02:44.081 --> 01:02:46.116
You guys know what I'm
talkin' about, right?


1503
01:02:46.150 --> 01:02:48.552
That guy is not gonna
amount to a fucking thing.


1504
01:02:48.586 --> 01:02:50.120
You see that?

1505
01:02:50.154 --> 01:02:52.956
If he acts like this here,
imagine what he's doin' outside.


1506
01:02:52.990 --> 01:02:54.458
His fuckin' father threw him out
of his house,


1507
01:02:54.491 --> 01:02:56.327
I'm... I bet you any money.

1508
01:02:56.360 --> 01:02:59.029
I... I want the truth
out of everyone, okay?


1509
01:02:59.063 --> 01:03:00.931
That guy is not gonna
give you the truth.


1510
01:03:00.964 --> 01:03:03.167
You are... what you're
gonna give me is


1511
01:03:03.200 --> 01:03:04.935
the truth, right?

1512
01:03:04.968 --> 01:03:07.504
Jasmine, take off
your clothes again.


1513
01:03:07.538 --> 01:03:09.039
Whatever, Barry.

1514
01:03:09.073 --> 01:03:09.940
Huh.

1515
01:03:09.973 --> 01:03:13.043
(Indistinct chatter)

1516
01:03:14.912 --> 01:03:17.147
Excuse me, is uh,
this seat taken?


1517
01:03:17.181 --> 01:03:18.415
It's all yours.

1518
01:03:18.449 --> 01:03:20.050
Thanks.

1519
01:03:20.084 --> 01:03:21.686
- (Takes a deep breath)
- (Indistinct lyrics in background)


1520
01:03:21.720 --> 01:03:22.986
K.C.: Hey, guys.

1521
01:03:23.020 --> 01:03:24.421
What can I get
you tonight?


1522
01:03:24.455 --> 01:03:26.123
Um...

1523
01:03:26.156 --> 01:03:28.225
That apple martini
looks pretty good.


1524
01:03:28.258 --> 01:03:32.062
(Chuckling) An apple a
day keeps somebody away.


1525
01:03:32.096 --> 01:03:34.699
(Chuckling)
It's... it's the doctor.


1526
01:03:34.733 --> 01:03:36.533
(Chuckling) That's
good advice.


1527
01:03:36.568 --> 01:03:37.569
Yeah.

1528
01:03:37.602 --> 01:03:39.269
Can I get you another?

1529
01:03:39.303 --> 01:03:40.971
(Chuckling) You can
get me another one.


1530
01:03:41.004 --> 01:03:42.506
- (Giggling)
- Alright, alright, another one.


1531
01:03:42.539 --> 01:03:44.809
Two apple
martinis, please.


1532
01:03:44.843 --> 01:03:46.243
With extra apples.

1533
01:03:46.276 --> 01:03:47.478
With extra apples!

1534
01:03:47.511 --> 01:03:50.447
(Chuckling)

1535
01:03:50.481 --> 01:03:53.283
So what's a babe like you
doin' in a place like this?


1536
01:03:53.317 --> 01:03:55.419
(Chuckling)
You come here often?


1537
01:03:55.452 --> 01:03:56.387
What's my sign?

1538
01:03:56.420 --> 01:03:57.521
No, no.

1539
01:03:57.555 --> 01:03:58.857
What's your sign?

1540
01:03:58.889 --> 01:04:02.025
(Chuckling)

1541
01:04:02.059 --> 01:04:05.496
MAN 3: That's the best pick
up line I've heard all night.


1542
01:04:05.529 --> 01:04:07.665
- (Chuckling)
- K.C.: Guys.


1543
01:04:07.699 --> 01:04:09.868
- You.
- Mm, mm, yum.


1544
01:04:09.900 --> 01:04:11.435
- Thank you.
- K.C.: Yeah, enjoy.


1545
01:04:11.468 --> 01:04:13.203
Mmm.

1546
01:04:13.237 --> 01:04:14.706
(Chuckling) Okay.

1547
01:04:14.739 --> 01:04:17.307
(Chuckling) Hmm, hmm.

1550
01:04:21.613 --> 01:04:22.614
I beat ya.

1551
01:04:22.647 --> 01:04:23.648

(Phone ringing)

1555
01:04:31.623 --> 01:04:33.090
Excuse me, I gotta
take this call.


1556
01:04:33.123 --> 01:04:34.158
It's my mom.

1557
01:04:34.191 --> 01:04:36.828
- You're excused.
- Don't go anywhere.


1558
01:04:36.861 --> 01:04:38.128
Where am I gonna go?

1559
01:04:38.162 --> 01:04:39.798
The movies?

1560
01:04:39.831 --> 01:04:42.032

- Hey.
- Hey.


1563
01:04:45.302 --> 01:04:46.370
Sorry to interrupt.

1564
01:04:46.403 --> 01:04:48.238
Um, I couldn't help but
overhear what you said


1565
01:04:48.272 --> 01:04:49.574
- about the movies.
- (Chuckling)


1566
01:04:49.607 --> 01:04:52.376
Um, there's actually
a good foreign film playin'


1567
01:04:52.409 --> 01:04:54.813
over at the Film Forum.

1568
01:04:54.846 --> 01:04:57.381
- Uh, <i>Les Bonnes Femme</i>.
- <i>Les Bonnes Femm</i>.


1569
01:04:57.414 --> 01:05:00.451
(Laughing)

1570
01:05:00.484 --> 01:05:02.787
Oh, French fries sound
so good.


1571
01:05:02.821 --> 01:05:03.822
You want... you
want some fries?


1572
01:05:03.855 --> 01:05:05.557
- I can order some?
- Yeah, yeah.


1573
01:05:05.590 --> 01:05:08.492
- They're good here.
- French fries with a side of apple martini.


1574
01:05:08.525 --> 01:05:10.929
- Mm...
- (Chuckling)


1575
01:05:10.961 --> 01:05:13.197
Hey buddy,
I was sitting there.


1576
01:05:13.230 --> 01:05:14.231
Calm down, okay?

1577
01:05:14.264 --> 01:05:16.400
I'm just having a chat
with the nice lady.


1578
01:05:16.433 --> 01:05:18.235
Yeah, I noticed.

1579
01:05:18.268 --> 01:05:20.037
Hey, don't be a fuckin'
hypocrite, okay?


1580
01:05:20.070 --> 01:05:21.538
I've been watching you.

1581
01:05:21.573 --> 01:05:22.740
You've been watching me?

1582
01:05:22.774 --> 01:05:24.374
What are you
some kinda creep?


1583
01:05:24.408 --> 01:05:25.610
Look, I saw her first.

1584
01:05:25.643 --> 01:05:27.779
She's been getting hammered
for the past three hours.


1585
01:05:27.812 --> 01:05:29.513
<i>Les Bonnes Femm</i>.

01:05:29.546 --> 01:05:31.883

- (Grunting)


1589
01:05:36.520 --> 01:05:38.388
Oh my God!

1590
01:05:40.592 --> 01:05:43.728
(Sobbing)

1591
01:05:50.234 --> 01:05:52.837
Oh God, I'm never
drinking again.


1592
01:05:52.871 --> 01:05:54.939
- PHILIP: Never?
- Never.


1593
01:05:54.973 --> 01:05:56.440
- Your birthday?
- SARAH: No.


1594
01:05:56.473 --> 01:05:58.308
- New Year's?
- SARAH: No.


1595
01:05:58.342 --> 01:06:01.245
- Your wedding?
- (Chuckling) I'm never getting married.


1596
01:06:01.278 --> 01:06:04.548
(Chuckling) Oh shit.

1597
01:06:04.582 --> 01:06:05.617
(Sighing) Work.

1598
01:06:05.650 --> 01:06:07.317
SARAH:
Mmhmm.

01:06:07.351 --> 01:06:10.588
- PHILIP: Hmm, see ya later.
- SARAH: Sure.


1600
01:06:10.622 --> 01:06:12.256

(Chuckling)

1602
01:06:14.692 --> 01:06:16.928
Hello, there.

1603
01:06:16.961 --> 01:06:18.228
Nice weather, huh?

1604
01:06:18.262 --> 01:06:19.864
No?

1605
01:06:19.898 --> 01:06:21.566
(Indistinct chatter
in background)


1606
01:06:21.599 --> 01:06:22.600
MAN 4:
Something I said?


1607
01:06:22.634 --> 01:06:24.334
Where are you going?

1608
01:06:24.368 --> 01:06:26.503
Hey, I wanna talk to you.

1609
01:06:26.537 --> 01:06:27.572
(Traffic whooshing)

1610
01:06:27.605 --> 01:06:31.141
MAN 4:
Can you please slow down?


1611
01:06:31.174 --> 01:06:33.210
Hello?

1612
01:06:33.243 --> 01:06:35.279
Ms. Quintana!

1613
01:06:35.312 --> 01:06:38.850
Ms. Quintana,
can you stop moving?


1614
01:06:38.883 --> 01:06:40.384
Excuse me?

1615
01:06:40.417 --> 01:06:43.520
MAN 4:
No, excuse me.


1616
01:06:43.555 --> 01:06:45.489
Do we know each other?

1617
01:06:45.522 --> 01:06:47.257
Kind of a one-way street.

1618
01:06:47.291 --> 01:06:49.894
You don't know me,
I know you.


1619
01:06:49.928 --> 01:06:51.729
Well, I know about you.

1620
01:06:51.763 --> 01:06:54.666
(Chuckles) I have friends on the
NYPD, I'm calling the police.


1621
01:06:56.099 --> 01:06:57.501
I am the police.

1622
01:06:57.534 --> 01:07:00.805
I am the NYPD.

1623
01:07:00.838 --> 01:07:03.473
You and I, we need to talk.

1624
01:07:03.507 --> 01:07:06.044
Here's my card.

1625
01:07:06.076 --> 01:07:08.245
I want you to
call me today.


1626
01:07:08.278 --> 01:07:12.717
Actually, I want you to
come and see me today.


1627
01:07:12.750 --> 01:07:14.852
Are we clear?

1628
01:07:16.754 --> 01:07:19.824
(Traffic whooshing)

1629
01:07:21.559 --> 01:07:24.428
Look, it's a victimless crime.

1630
01:07:25.830 --> 01:07:30.635
Dealing drugs and homicide
are victimless crimes.


1631
01:07:30.668 --> 01:07:31.703
Drugs?

1632
01:07:31.736 --> 01:07:33.370
Homicide?

1633
01:07:33.403 --> 01:07:36.641
What do y... what
do you mean?


1634
01:07:36.674 --> 01:07:40.377
I mean I'm talking
about Troy Remy.


1635
01:07:40.410 --> 01:07:41.946
Troy?

1636
01:07:41.980 --> 01:07:44.414
What are you
talking about?


1637
01:07:46.017 --> 01:07:49.721
MAN 4: I am talking
about Troy fucking Remy.


1638
01:07:49.754 --> 01:07:51.488
You know him?

1639
01:07:51.521 --> 01:07:53.256
Yeah.

1640
01:07:55.158 --> 01:07:58.096
Sorry, uh, I don't know
anything about this.


1641
01:08:01.164 --> 01:08:03.635
Why don't you stop
and taken off your sunglasses?


1642
01:08:03.668 --> 01:08:05.870
Why?

1643
01:08:05.903 --> 01:08:08.238
'Cause it's impolite
and stupid to wear sunglasses


1644
01:08:08.271 --> 01:08:11.174
in a closed building.

1645
01:08:11.208 --> 01:08:14.812
Well, I don't wanna get arrested
for being impolite.


1646
01:08:14.846 --> 01:08:16.881
Or stupid.

1647
01:08:18.750 --> 01:08:21.853
Oh, that's lovely.

1648
01:08:21.886 --> 01:08:23.621
Did he do that to you?

1649
01:08:23.655 --> 01:08:25.690
Who?

1650
01:08:25.723 --> 01:08:28.960
Your boy, Troy.

1651
01:08:28.993 --> 01:08:30.695
Uh, no.

1652
01:08:32.897 --> 01:08:35.800
Sarah, why don't
I believe you?


1653
01:08:35.833 --> 01:08:38.102
That's your
issue, not mine.


1654
01:08:38.136 --> 01:08:41.639
MAN 4: Well, it's gonna be your
issue, too, if you don't tell me.


1655
01:08:41.673 --> 01:08:44.676
You wanna stay out of trouble,
don't you?


1656
01:08:46.010 --> 01:08:47.210
Yes.

1657
01:08:47.244 --> 01:08:49.681
MAN 4:
Then talk to me.


1658
01:08:50.848 --> 01:08:53.283
(Takes a deep breath)

1659
01:08:54.652 --> 01:08:56.654
Do I need a lawyer?

1660
01:08:56.688 --> 01:08:58.790
I don't know,
Sarah, do you?


1661
01:08:58.823 --> 01:09:02.359
Look, Troy is a hot
film director, okay?


1662
01:09:02.392 --> 01:09:04.528
He doesn't need
to sell drugs.


1663
01:09:04.562 --> 01:09:06.931
Did you see <i>The Fault Within</i>?

1664
01:09:06.964 --> 01:09:10.601
Uh, no, and neither
did anybody else.


1665
01:09:10.635 --> 01:09:15.773
I mean, all told, his films
maybe grossed about 37 bucks.


1666
01:09:16.941 --> 01:09:19.911
He earns his money
from dealing drugs.


1667
01:09:21.344 --> 01:09:24.347
That's how he affords
that swanky loft of his.


1668
01:09:24.381 --> 01:09:26.117
Can you just get
to the point?


1669
01:09:26.150 --> 01:09:30.555
Do you know he has five
ODs under his belt?


1670
01:09:30.588 --> 01:09:32.522
Only two of the
girls survived.


1671
01:09:32.557 --> 01:09:35.292
What is it you'd like
me to write on your tombstone?


1672
01:09:35.325 --> 01:09:38.228
"I should have listened to
Detective Belson


1673
01:09:38.261 --> 01:09:40.631
when I had the chance."

1674
01:09:40.665 --> 01:09:43.568
I know guys like
this prick.


1675
01:09:43.601 --> 01:09:46.671
I have a daughter
your age.


1676
01:09:46.704 --> 01:09:50.875
And she is just as snarky
and know-it-all like you.


1677
01:09:52.610 --> 01:09:55.479
Now, why don't you
let me help you?


1678
01:09:55.512 --> 01:09:58.415
(♪♪♪)

1679
01:10:03.386 --> 01:10:06.323
(Siren wailing in distance)

1680
01:10:06.356 --> 01:10:10.094
(♪♪♪)

1681
01:10:16.100 --> 01:10:17.267
Move in with me.

1682
01:10:17.300 --> 01:10:18.401
Huh?

1683
01:10:18.435 --> 01:10:19.837
Move in with me.

1684
01:10:19.871 --> 01:10:21.371
Be my old lady.

1685
01:10:21.404 --> 01:10:22.439
Your old lady?

1686
01:10:22.472 --> 01:10:24.175
It's just an expression.

1687
01:10:24.208 --> 01:10:25.509
Move in with me.

1688
01:10:25.542 --> 01:10:28.079
We can make lots
of movies together.


1689
01:10:28.112 --> 01:10:32.315
Be my muse like
Dietrich and Sternberg,


1690
01:10:32.349 --> 01:10:33.517
Tippi and Hitchcock.

1691
01:10:33.550 --> 01:10:34.919
I'll even act.

1692
01:10:34.952 --> 01:10:38.589
Al Pacino and
Michelle Pfeiffer!


1693
01:10:38.623 --> 01:10:39.757
Isn't it too soon?

1694
01:10:39.791 --> 01:10:41.793
There is no too soon.

1695
01:10:41.826 --> 01:10:44.228
There are either right vibes
and wrong vibes.


1696
01:10:44.262 --> 01:10:46.396
These vibes are right.

1697
01:10:46.429 --> 01:10:48.199
When you know, you know.

1698
01:10:48.232 --> 01:10:50.500
And I know.

1699
01:10:50.534 --> 01:10:52.236
I am not moving
in with him.


1700
01:10:52.270 --> 01:10:54.471
- Sarah.
- What?


1701
01:10:54.504 --> 01:10:57.374
- Well, then just leave.
- That's it?


1702
01:10:57.407 --> 01:11:00.244
- Well...
- Well, what?


1703
01:11:00.278 --> 01:11:02.079
If you leave now, can you
live with yourself knowin'


1704
01:11:02.113 --> 01:11:05.549
that animal is peddling
pills to kids?


1705
01:11:05.583 --> 01:11:07.051
I still don't
think that's true.


1706
01:11:07.084 --> 01:11:08.586
Oh, it's true.

1707
01:11:08.619 --> 01:11:11.022
This scumbag has taken
advantage of young girls


1708
01:11:11.055 --> 01:11:14.457
just like yourself and you could
live with that?


1709
01:11:14.491 --> 01:11:17.562
- Habla Español, Señorita Quintana?
- Not really.


1710
01:11:17.595 --> 01:11:19.597
- Si o no?
- No.


1711
01:11:19.630 --> 01:11:21.331
You didn't speak
Spanish at home?


1712
01:11:21.364 --> 01:11:24.769
Is this your attempt
at good cop, bad cop?


1713
01:11:24.802 --> 01:11:27.572
(Chuckling)

1714
01:11:27.605 --> 01:11:28.706
What do you think this is?

1715
01:11:28.739 --> 01:11:30.608
Television?

1716
01:11:30.641 --> 01:11:33.311
Honey, this is not
a TV show.


1717
01:11:33.343 --> 01:11:35.313
And you're in a real
quandary,


1718
01:11:35.345 --> 01:11:37.380
because you have to help
yourself


1719
01:11:37.414 --> 01:11:39.449
and you have help us.

1720
01:11:39.482 --> 01:11:41.752
So what are you gonna do?

1721
01:11:41.786 --> 01:11:45.189
The bottom line,
I want Troy Remy


1722
01:11:45.223 --> 01:11:47.859
and you're gonna be
the one to help us!


1723
01:11:47.892 --> 01:11:51.295
So do what you must do.

1724
01:11:51.329 --> 01:11:52.663
I'm not moving
in with him.


1725
01:11:52.697 --> 01:11:53.965
You better listen to
what he's tellin' you


1726
01:11:53.998 --> 01:11:55.498
if you know what's good
for you.


1727
01:11:55.532 --> 01:11:56.499
Then don't move
in with him.


1728
01:11:56.533 --> 01:11:58.202
Be his girl.

1729
01:11:58.236 --> 01:11:59.369
Get close to him.

1730
01:11:59.402 --> 01:12:01.005
Get some intel.

1731
01:12:01.038 --> 01:12:04.108
Help us and help yourself.

1732
01:12:04.141 --> 01:12:05.676
Am I clear?

1733
01:12:07.311 --> 01:12:10.047
(♪♪♪)

1734
01:12:18.055 --> 01:12:21.092
(Sobbing)

1735
01:12:27.064 --> 01:12:29.700
(♪♪♪)

1736
01:12:29.734 --> 01:12:31.068
Sarah, just remember one thing,

1737
01:12:31.102 --> 01:12:33.204
at the end of the day, they all
just wanna fuck you.


1738
01:12:33.237 --> 01:12:35.505
They wanna fuck you
any which way they can.


1739
01:12:35.538 --> 01:12:38.242
They all wanted to fuck me
and they all wanna fuck you.


1740
01:12:38.276 --> 01:12:41.779
That's why you're in
the world to get fucked.


1741
01:12:41.812 --> 01:12:43.748
I have big plans, mom.

1742
01:12:43.781 --> 01:12:45.950
To hell with
your big plans.


1743
01:12:45.983 --> 01:12:48.986
You don't mean anything
to any of them.


1744
01:12:50.154 --> 01:12:52.290
Who's she?

1745
01:12:52.323 --> 01:12:54.292
MOM:
I don't know.


1746
01:12:54.325 --> 01:12:56.493
Maybe it's you.

1747
01:12:56.526 --> 01:12:59.130
Maybe it's future you.

1748
01:12:59.163 --> 01:13:01.065
Is she dead?

1749
01:13:01.098 --> 01:13:03.200
Maybe.

1750
01:13:05.703 --> 01:13:08.272
Why did you leave?

1751
01:13:08.306 --> 01:13:10.942
(♪♪♪)

1752
01:13:19.917 --> 01:13:22.853
(Sobbing)

1753
01:13:30.628 --> 01:13:31.662
Hey.

1754
01:13:31.696 --> 01:13:32.697
What are you doing here?

1755
01:13:32.730 --> 01:13:34.065
I have class.

1756
01:13:34.098 --> 01:13:37.034
You are ducking me
and I need info.


1757
01:13:37.068 --> 01:13:38.936
Here I am.

1758
01:13:38.970 --> 01:13:41.439
Fine.

1759
01:13:41.471 --> 01:13:43.174
Right, they're cops.

1760
01:13:43.207 --> 01:13:47.544
Well, retired cops, but
once a badge, always a badge.


1761
01:13:47.578 --> 01:13:48.612
That's correct.

1762
01:13:48.646 --> 01:13:50.147
- (Sighing)
- What else?


1763
01:13:50.181 --> 01:13:53.951
They're super creepy,
kinda eccentric.


1764
01:13:53.985 --> 01:13:56.387
I almost think they
might be a couple.


1765
01:13:56.420 --> 01:13:57.621
A couple of what?

1766
01:13:57.655 --> 01:13:59.457
A couple.

1767
01:13:59.489 --> 01:14:02.126
You know like,
a couple couple?


1768
01:14:02.159 --> 01:14:03.526
Interesting.

1769
01:14:03.561 --> 01:14:05.262
But they're not.

1770
01:14:05.296 --> 01:14:07.530
They're not interesting
or they're not a couple?


1771
01:14:07.565 --> 01:14:08.799
Both.

1772
01:14:08.833 --> 01:14:11.969
No, I mean, neither.

1773
01:14:12.003 --> 01:14:13.104
Okay.

1774
01:14:13.137 --> 01:14:15.306
And you take money back and
forth to this warehouse?


1775
01:14:15.339 --> 01:14:16.874
SARAH:
Correct.


1776
01:14:16.907 --> 01:14:19.110
And these two clowns
are always at the warehouse?


1777
01:14:19.143 --> 01:14:21.679
SARAH:
Yes.


1778
01:14:21.712 --> 01:14:23.546
Okay, I'll look into that.

1779
01:14:23.581 --> 01:14:25.316
No.

1780
01:14:25.349 --> 01:14:27.985
- Excuse me?
- No, this is the trade-off, okay?


1781
01:14:28.019 --> 01:14:30.654
I gave you this and
I'm no longer your rat.


1782
01:14:30.688 --> 01:14:32.490
I want Troy and you'll
do what I ask you to do.


1783
01:14:32.522 --> 01:14:33.557
How's that?

1784
01:14:33.591 --> 01:14:35.292
This is bigger than Troy.

1785
01:14:35.326 --> 01:14:36.494
Oh, really?

1786
01:14:36.526 --> 01:14:38.029
Little girl telling
me my business.


1787
01:14:38.062 --> 01:14:39.797
Look, I'm walking
either way, okay?


1788
01:14:39.830 --> 01:14:41.499
I didn't do
anything wrong.


1789
01:14:41.531 --> 01:14:42.833
How about six to
eight years just for


1790
01:14:42.867 --> 01:14:44.268
carryin' that money?

1791
01:14:44.301 --> 01:14:45.936
I'd be out in 30 months.

1792
01:14:45.970 --> 01:14:47.972
DETECTIVE BELSON: And you're
willing to do 30 months?


1793
01:14:48.005 --> 01:14:51.409
It beats hangin'
out with Troy.


1794
01:14:51.442 --> 01:14:53.644
Just do your fucking
job, alright?


1795
01:14:53.677 --> 01:14:55.346
It's not my job to
tell you how to do


1796
01:14:55.379 --> 01:14:57.948
your fucking job.

1797
01:15:02.019 --> 01:15:03.921
(Sighing)

1798
01:15:03.954 --> 01:15:05.723
Cops are touting their
bust up


1799
01:15:05.756 --> 01:15:08.959
of a $50-million counterfeit
goods ring.


1800
01:15:08.993 --> 01:15:11.128
Hours ago, they raided
a warehouse here on


1801
01:15:11.162 --> 01:15:12.930
Manhattan's West Side.

1802
01:15:12.963 --> 01:15:17.601
The loot: fake Gucci bags,
fake North Face jackets,


1803
01:15:17.635 --> 01:15:20.971
fake Beats
by Dre headphones.


1804
01:15:21.005 --> 01:15:24.175
TOMMY: Who the hell told me
to go into business with you?


1805
01:15:24.208 --> 01:15:26.510
I know I was gonna get
locked up eventually,


1806
01:15:26.544 --> 01:15:27.778
fucking great idea.

1807
01:15:27.812 --> 01:15:29.947
I'm goin' first, fuck you.

1808
01:15:29.980 --> 01:15:31.782
- Yeah, I dumped her.
- BOB (On the phone): What?


1809
01:15:31.816 --> 01:15:32.950
Are you kidding me?

1810
01:15:32.983 --> 01:15:34.685
Well, what happened to
your delicate flower?


1811
01:15:34.718 --> 01:15:36.554
She was getting too needy.

1812
01:15:36.587 --> 01:15:38.089
BOB (On the phone):
<i>So just like that?</i>


1813
01:15:38.122 --> 01:15:39.523
Just like that.

1814
01:15:39.558 --> 01:15:41.592
I don't get you, kid.

1815
01:15:41.625 --> 01:15:43.627
Well, let's say no
more actresses for me.


1816
01:15:43.661 --> 01:15:45.830
Flaky self-centered
prima donnas, man.


1817
01:15:45.863 --> 01:15:48.567
I'll remind you that next
time you date another one.


1818
01:15:48.599 --> 01:15:51.502
Yeah, well, I don't...
Whoa, wait, Bob,


1819
01:15:51.535 --> 01:15:52.503
I'll talk to you later.

1820
01:15:52.536 --> 01:15:55.072
See you at my bar.

1821
01:15:59.578 --> 01:16:02.680
(Phone ringing)

1822
01:16:06.250 --> 01:16:07.218
What?

1823
01:16:07.251 --> 01:16:08.352
Sarah!

1824
01:16:08.385 --> 01:16:09.787
Where the fuck you been?

1825
01:16:09.820 --> 01:16:11.155
What about our movie?

1826
01:16:11.188 --> 01:16:13.724
Come on, man, this is very
unprofessional of you.


1827
01:16:15.993 --> 01:16:17.528
Sarah?

1828
01:16:17.562 --> 01:16:19.163
<i>Sarah!</i>

1829
01:16:19.196 --> 01:16:20.364
Sarah!

1830
01:16:20.397 --> 01:16:22.867
Fuck!

1831
01:16:22.900 --> 01:16:25.503
(Sighs)

1832
01:16:29.340 --> 01:16:30.975
(Chuckles)

1833
01:16:32.443 --> 01:16:35.112
Hey, uh, uh, are
you my new neighbor?


1834
01:16:35.146 --> 01:16:36.814
Uh, am I?

1835
01:16:36.847 --> 01:16:38.916
Well, if you're moving
in here, you are.


1836
01:16:38.949 --> 01:16:39.950
I'm Frankie.

1837
01:16:39.984 --> 01:16:42.086
- Frankie Li.
- Um, Ivy.


1838
01:16:42.119 --> 01:16:44.955
Ivy Wellman.

1839
01:16:44.989 --> 01:16:47.391
Enchanté.

1840
01:16:47.424 --> 01:16:48.926
Huh?

1841
01:16:48.959 --> 01:16:50.227
Enchanted.

1842
01:16:50.261 --> 01:16:51.195
You enchant me.

1843
01:16:51.228 --> 01:16:52.429
I'm enchanted.

1844
01:16:52.463 --> 01:16:53.831
Oh.

1845
01:16:53.864 --> 01:16:54.765
Wow.

1846
01:16:54.798 --> 01:16:56.767
- Me too. (Chuckles)
- Allow me.


1847
01:16:56.800 --> 01:16:59.638
Okay, just... yeah,
careful with her.


1848
01:16:59.670 --> 01:17:02.473
So are you new in town or just
a change of neighborhood?


1849
01:17:02.506 --> 01:17:04.441
Uh, I'm new in town.

1850
01:17:04.475 --> 01:17:06.944
I'm a singer/songwriter,
so you know,


1851
01:17:06.977 --> 01:17:08.679
New York's
the place.


1852
01:17:08.712 --> 01:17:09.947
Well, thank goodness.

1853
01:17:09.980 --> 01:17:12.082
I thought you would be
an actress or something.


1854
01:17:12.116 --> 01:17:13.918
There's too many of
those around New York already.


1855
01:17:13.951 --> 01:17:15.452
Oh, really?

1856
01:17:15.486 --> 01:17:17.421
Under every rock.

1857
01:17:17.454 --> 01:17:20.191
So what are you like
uh, Taylor Swift?


1858
01:17:20.224 --> 01:17:23.194
Um, more like Bob Dylan.

1859
01:17:23.227 --> 01:17:25.930
He started here, so
it's good enough for me.


1860
01:17:25.963 --> 01:17:27.798
Oh, Dylan.

1861
01:17:27.831 --> 01:17:29.900
The Ballad of Frankie Lee
and Judas Priest?


1862
01:17:29.934 --> 01:17:31.468
That's right,
that's a great song.


1863
01:17:31.502 --> 01:17:32.803
(Chuckling)

1864
01:17:32.836 --> 01:17:36.040
Well, right
this way, Ivy Wellman.


1865
01:17:36.073 --> 01:17:37.741
Okay.

1866
01:17:39.777 --> 01:17:42.246
Hey, by the way, what
apartment you're in?


1867
01:17:42.279 --> 01:17:44.715
Uh, 7B.

1868
01:17:44.748 --> 01:17:45.916
We are neighbors then.

1869
01:17:45.950 --> 01:17:46.750
I'm in 7C!

1870
01:17:46.784 --> 01:17:48.519
Oh, how about that!

1871
01:17:48.552 --> 01:17:49.553
You need help
with your bag?


1872
01:17:49.588 --> 01:17:50.955
No, no, that's okay.

1873
01:17:50.988 --> 01:17:52.089
Thank you.

1874
01:17:52.122 --> 01:17:54.659
Hey, you have plans
for dinner tonight?


1875
01:17:54.693 --> 01:17:57.228
Um, no, I don't,
but that would be great,


1876
01:17:57.261 --> 01:17:58.597
because I haven't had
a chance to pick up


1877
01:17:58.630 --> 01:18:00.130
any groceries yet.

1878
01:18:00.164 --> 01:18:01.198
Great.

1879
01:18:01.232 --> 01:18:02.667
And it's on me, of course.

1880
01:18:02.701 --> 01:18:04.401
- (Chuckling)
- I made a killing on Bitcoins.


1881
01:18:04.435 --> 01:18:06.203
Wow, even better.

1882
01:18:06.237 --> 01:18:08.339
You are such a sweetheart,
Frankie Li!


1883
01:18:08.372 --> 01:18:10.074
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.


1884
01:18:10.107 --> 01:18:12.476
Oh, and can you recommend
a good laundry service


1885
01:18:12.509 --> 01:18:14.144
around here?

1886
01:18:14.178 --> 01:18:15.446
Why you ask?

1887
01:18:15.479 --> 01:18:16.981
Because I'm Chinese?

1888
01:18:17.014 --> 01:18:17.948
Oh, no, no.

1889
01:18:17.982 --> 01:18:18.782
I'm... I'm sorry.

1890
01:18:18.816 --> 01:18:20.284
I... I didn't mean that.

1891
01:18:20.317 --> 01:18:22.152
Um, sorry.

1892
01:18:22.186 --> 01:18:23.622
Just kidding.

1893
01:18:23.655 --> 01:18:25.456
I know a place
and they deliver.


1894
01:18:25.489 --> 01:18:27.124
(Chuckles) Okay.

1895
01:18:29.728 --> 01:18:32.731
(♪♪♪)

1896
01:19:03.728 --> 01:19:05.664
(♪♪♪)

1897
01:19:05.697 --> 01:19:07.197
(Gasping)
Who the fuck are you?


1898
01:19:07.231 --> 01:19:08.265
No, don't worry,
don't worry.


1899
01:19:08.299 --> 01:19:09.967
You left your keys in
the door, that's all.


1900
01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:12.336
I was visiting my girlfriend
down the hall,


1901
01:19:12.369 --> 01:19:13.738
I saw the keys
in the door.


1902
01:19:13.772 --> 01:19:15.774
I knocked, but
you didn't answer.


1903
01:19:15.806 --> 01:19:17.074
So I thought
something was wrong.


1904
01:19:17.107 --> 01:19:19.243
I was getting ready
to call the police.


1905
01:19:19.276 --> 01:19:20.745
No, don't worry.

1906
01:19:20.779 --> 01:19:22.346
You know and you shouldn't leave
your keys in the door.


1907
01:19:22.379 --> 01:19:25.316
A girl can't be too careful
these days in the city.


1908
01:19:25.349 --> 01:19:26.317
Don't worry.

1909
01:19:26.350 --> 01:19:27.585
I'm sorry.

1910
01:19:27.619 --> 01:19:29.520
I'm so sorry.

1911
01:19:29.553 --> 01:19:32.890
(Screaming)

1912
01:19:32.923 --> 01:19:35.859
(Sobbing)

1913
01:19:43.867 --> 01:19:46.671
WOMAN 1: The choice between
hell and happiness, Sarah,


1914
01:19:46.705 --> 01:19:49.540
is entirely yours.

1915
01:19:49.574 --> 01:19:50.874
Don't share yourself with
those that don't


1916
01:19:50.908 --> 01:19:53.477
have your interests
at heart.


1917
01:19:53.510 --> 01:19:55.814
Everything you make
has consequences,


1918
01:19:55.846 --> 01:19:57.915
so develop a sense
of caution.


1919
01:19:57.948 --> 01:20:00.719
Save yourself from the
pain that devours your spirit


1920
01:20:00.752 --> 01:20:03.053
and destroys your soul.

1921
01:20:03.087 --> 01:20:04.955
But how?

1922
01:20:04.988 --> 01:20:06.423
How do I do that?

1923
01:20:06.457 --> 01:20:08.459
Don't take it anymore.

1924
01:20:08.492 --> 01:20:11.862
You are a warrior.

1925
01:20:16.300 --> 01:20:20.270
