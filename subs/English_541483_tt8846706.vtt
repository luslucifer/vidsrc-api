2
00:03:22.585 --> 00:03:23.852
Going up, Ken?

3
00:03:24.852 --> 00:03:25.819
I'm here to see Duke.

4
00:03:25.852 --> 00:03:26.719
Hmm.

5
00:03:28.886 --> 00:03:29.752
Me too.

6
00:05:19.886 --> 00:05:22.019
I hear Helen's due soon.

7
00:05:23.219 --> 00:05:24.418
We're having a little girl.

8
00:05:28.852 --> 00:05:31.518
They smell a bit funny,
don't you think?


9
00:05:32.819 --> 00:05:33.485
I don't mean little girls,

10
00:05:33.518 --> 00:05:35.919
I just mean babies in general.

11
00:05:35.952 --> 00:05:36.852
They smell funny.

12
00:05:38.552 --> 00:05:40.886
Well she'll be our
first, I'm not really sure.


13
00:05:43.785 --> 00:05:45.819
Well let me tell you
something that I'm sure of, Ken.


14
00:05:47.052 --> 00:05:48.852
We're not the fucking bank.

15
00:05:51.186 --> 00:05:52.919
So what the fuck is that?

16
00:05:52.952 --> 00:05:55.785
I just need some
more time, please.


17
00:05:55.819 --> 00:05:56.952
Please, can I speak to Duke?

18
00:05:56.986 --> 00:05:58.719
You wanted a loan.

19
00:05:58.752 --> 00:06:00.452
You came to us, yes?

20
00:06:00.485 --> 00:06:01.152
- Yes.
- Yes.


21
00:06:07.919 --> 00:06:10.652
They say it costs
around 400 grand


22
00:06:10.685 --> 00:06:11.919
to raise a kid these days.

23
00:06:13.919 --> 00:06:16.819
I read this thing in a
baby magazine.


24
00:06:20.552 --> 00:06:22.052
You read it in a
baby magazine.


25
00:06:26.652 --> 00:06:27.785
You read it in a
baby magazine.


26
00:06:32.852 --> 00:06:33.619
You having a joke, Ken?

27
00:06:33.652 --> 00:06:36.552
No, mate, no, it's fact,
all right?


28
00:06:37.685 --> 00:06:38.819
It's a fact.

29
00:06:38.852 --> 00:06:40.652
You read it in a baby
magazine?


30
00:06:40.685 --> 00:06:42.518
You read it, yeah?

31
00:06:46.619 --> 00:06:47.485
Stop!

32
00:06:47.518 --> 00:06:48.752
I can pop your eyes out from
out here.


33
00:06:48.785 --> 00:06:49.652
Ange!

34
00:06:55.785 --> 00:06:56.652
Leave.

35
00:07:07.152 --> 00:07:08.052
Hey, music man.

36
00:07:09.019 --> 00:07:10.086
Hey.

37
00:07:10.119 --> 00:07:10.986
How you going?

38
00:07:12.152 --> 00:07:13.385
Got any tunes for me?

39
00:07:17.485 --> 00:07:18.152
Nice.

40
00:07:19.086 --> 00:07:21.418
This the masterpiece,
Childish Gambino?


41
00:07:21.452 --> 00:07:23.819
It's more like the entrĂ©e

42
00:07:23.852 --> 00:07:26.852
Still waiting for the
inspiration, you know?


43
00:07:26.886 --> 00:07:28.819
That'll do the trick.

44
00:07:29.919 --> 00:07:30.785
Ways.

45
00:08:03.785 --> 00:08:04.752
And you've gotta yield

46
00:08:04.785 --> 00:08:05.919
because I win!

47
00:08:20.952 --> 00:08:24.152
Fucking English,
you fucking...


48
00:08:24.186 --> 00:08:25.052
English!

49
00:08:26.852 --> 00:08:28.052
English, English!

50
00:08:38.518 --> 00:08:40.986
A broken man has
nothing to give.


51
00:08:43.752 --> 00:08:44.619
Yeah.

52
00:08:48.518 --> 00:08:50.518
But I would have had the
money by now.


53
00:08:53.186 --> 00:08:54.052
Maybe.

54
00:08:56.785 --> 00:08:57.986
But with a bit of care

55
00:08:58.019 --> 00:09:00.552
they'll be borrowing
from us again and again.


56
00:09:00.585 --> 00:09:01.752
He owes us.

57
00:09:01.785 --> 00:09:03.385
He owes me, Ange.

58
00:09:05.685 --> 00:09:06.552
He owes me.

59
00:09:08.685 --> 00:09:11.418
And one day everything
will be under your control


60
00:09:11.452 --> 00:09:12.986
but you gotta realise,
brute strength


61
00:09:13.019 --> 00:09:14.485
is not always the way.

62
00:09:14.518 --> 00:09:17.552
Sometimes you need to use
your brain.


63
00:09:19.652 --> 00:09:20.585
Eh, Bonnie?

64
00:09:24.986 --> 00:09:27.518
Pass me those tablets,
would you?


65
00:09:32.685 --> 00:09:35.019
You know you should put
her out of her misery.


66
00:09:37.518 --> 00:09:40.119
I'll put you out of your
fucking misery.


67
00:09:41.819 --> 00:09:42.986
She has heart.

68
00:09:48.685 --> 00:09:51.919
Come on, hey.

69
00:09:51.952 --> 00:09:53.119
That's good.

70
00:09:53.152 --> 00:09:58.152
Why not.

71
00:10:18.886 --> 00:10:20.119
Fuck are you doing here?

72
00:10:22.186 --> 00:10:23.986
Oy, what the fuck are you
doing here?!


73
00:10:24.019 --> 00:10:25.052
Hey that's enough.

74
00:10:25.086 --> 00:10:26.652
Mate, mate, that's enough.

75
00:10:28.219 --> 00:10:29.086
Come on.

76
00:10:29.119 --> 00:10:30.986
Hey, they're doing nothing,
all right?


77
00:10:31.019 --> 00:10:32.518
Just chill, dude, you right?

78
00:10:33.919 --> 00:10:35.719
Cool, just relax.

79
00:10:35.752 --> 00:10:37.019
Just relax, man.

80
00:10:37.052 --> 00:10:38.485
You okay?

81
00:10:38.518 --> 00:10:39.485
I'm good, I'm good, I'm good!

82
00:10:40.186 --> 00:10:41.052
What the?

83
00:10:44.986 --> 00:10:46.719
fuck!

84
00:10:49.852 --> 00:10:50.685
Hey!

85
00:10:53.585 --> 00:10:54.452
Jesus.

86
00:10:55.585 --> 00:10:56.986
Fucking traitor!

87
00:11:02.485 --> 00:11:03.152
Fuck.

88
00:12:10.919 --> 00:12:13.719
Come on, are you okay?

89
00:12:17.552 --> 00:12:18.418
Go, go, go!

90
00:12:36.052 --> 00:12:37.619
Down!

91
00:12:53.685 --> 00:12:55.086
Oh fuck.

92
00:12:55.119 --> 00:12:56.552
What the fuck?

93
00:12:56.585 --> 00:12:57.518
Fuck, fuck.

94
00:13:00.086 --> 00:13:01.952
I can't breathe.

95
00:13:01.986 --> 00:13:03.685
Look, I can't breathe.

96
00:13:03.719 --> 00:13:04.752
I can't breathe.

97
00:13:04.785 --> 00:13:05.418
Hey, calm down.

98
00:13:05.452 --> 00:13:06.785
I can't breathe!
It's okay.


99
00:13:06.819 --> 00:13:08.086
Shh, shh, shh, shh.

100
00:13:08.119 --> 00:13:09.652
Breathe, breathe.

101
00:13:10.685 --> 00:13:12.619
Shh, shh, breathe.

102
00:13:12.652 --> 00:13:13.485
Look at me.

103
00:13:13.518 --> 00:13:15.485
You're okay, look at me.

104
00:13:15.518 --> 00:13:17.785
You're all right, you're okay.

105
00:13:17.819 --> 00:13:20.418
You're okay.

106
00:13:25.919 --> 00:13:27.052
I'm Claudio.

107
00:13:28.152 --> 00:13:30.019
I'm Jaiwara.

108
00:13:52.485 --> 00:13:54.552
Yeah, yeah, I can go
to Miriam's.


109
00:13:58.052 --> 00:13:59.019
I'm okay, really.

110
00:14:09.152 --> 00:14:11.019
Is that your family?

111
00:14:11.052 --> 00:14:12.452
Yeah, my mom.

112
00:14:14.086 --> 00:14:15.886
Should I take you back
home then?


113
00:14:18.719 --> 00:14:20.719
I don't wanna go back there
right now.


114
00:14:32.719 --> 00:14:35.418
I love a good cup of tea,
don't you?


115
00:14:37.152 --> 00:14:38.652
Helps me to think straight.

116
00:14:46.852 --> 00:14:49.518
What happened is a tragedy.

117
00:14:49.552 --> 00:14:50.919
And I see it, it's happening
all over the world.


118
00:14:50.952 --> 00:14:54.086
It's like a cancer, a monster.

119
00:14:54.119 --> 00:14:58.119
And yet what, you come to me
and you accuse me of what?


120
00:14:58.152 --> 00:14:59.418
Being that monster?

121
00:14:59.452 --> 00:15:01.485
Why, where are my fingerprints?

122
00:15:01.518 --> 00:15:04.752
I understand this is not
America, Jeffrey,


123
00:15:04.785 --> 00:15:06.518
this is my home.

124
00:15:08.019 --> 00:15:10.052
Where I grew up, where
we grew up.


125
00:15:10.086 --> 00:15:12.552
And I care what manifests here.

126
00:15:15.552 --> 00:15:16.886
You do all right, Detective.

127
00:15:19.719 --> 00:15:21.785
You do better than all right, if
I recall.


128
00:15:23.152 --> 00:15:27.585
Yeah, well, this has attracted
eyes from every direction


129
00:15:28.518 --> 00:15:30.019
and they all want answers,

130
00:15:30.052 --> 00:15:31.719
answers I don't have.

131
00:15:33.186 --> 00:15:35.152
I mean it's all these
bloody eyes, you know?


132
00:15:35.186 --> 00:15:36.186
Angelo and his mates have turned

133
00:15:36.219 --> 00:15:38.019
it into a fucking jungle
out there.


134
00:15:38.052 --> 00:15:39.852
Mate, it's always been
that way.


135
00:15:39.886 --> 00:15:42.052
No, it hasn't, it's different
now, Duke.


136
00:15:42.086 --> 00:15:44.518
He is out of control.

137
00:15:48.086 --> 00:15:50.518
I mean a bit of dope, your
business loans,


138
00:15:50.552 --> 00:15:51.785
brothels, whatever, sure.

139
00:15:51.819 --> 00:15:52.952
But this!

140
00:15:54.919 --> 00:15:56.418
I can't do anything for you.

141
00:15:59.585 --> 00:16:01.019
Is that so?

142
00:16:01.052 --> 00:16:02.886
It's all about the drugs,
Duke.


143
00:16:02.919 --> 00:16:06.119
And your name is on
everyone's lips.


144
00:16:06.152 --> 00:16:08.619
You know, you need to get away.

145
00:16:08.652 --> 00:16:09.986
Take a holiday or something.

146
00:16:14.052 --> 00:16:15.619
I think maybe you're right.

147
00:16:18.119 --> 00:16:20.052
I've not been feeling
myself lately.


148
00:16:20.086 --> 00:16:21.919
I might go and sit on a beach.

149
00:16:22.886 --> 00:16:24.685
Get a tan, put my feet up.

150
00:16:25.619 --> 00:16:26.785
Good.

151
00:16:26.819 --> 00:16:27.719
That's a good idea.

152
00:16:27.752 --> 00:16:29.585
And I'll do everything I can to
help you.


153
00:16:29.619 --> 00:16:32.819
But I can only help you if
you're not here to help.


154
00:16:32.852 --> 00:16:36.585
And I swear to God you
should cut Ange loose.


155
00:16:36.619 --> 00:16:39.619
You have always been a
little maggot, Jeffrey,


156
00:16:39.652 --> 00:16:40.919
always the worrier.

157
00:16:40.952 --> 00:16:42.452
Ever since we were at school,

158
00:16:42.485 --> 00:16:45.119
you got too many fingers in too
many pies.


159
00:16:45.152 --> 00:16:47.819
Yeah well there ain't
no guarantees now, Duke.


160
00:16:47.852 --> 00:16:50.785
You work for me, you leech!

161
00:16:53.219 --> 00:16:54.886
If Angelo's not released within
the hour,


162
00:16:54.919 --> 00:16:56.552
you'll be in there next to him.

163
00:17:07.785 --> 00:17:09.919
My best to Catherine and
the kids.


164
00:17:23.152 --> 00:17:25.752
The boys are still at
their private school?


165
00:17:28.552 --> 00:17:29.452
Hmm?

166
00:17:31.919 --> 00:17:32.785
Yeah.

167
00:17:34.952 --> 00:17:35.819
Yeah.

168
00:17:40.619 --> 00:17:43.019
Okay, I'll do what I can for
Angelo.


169
00:17:43.052 --> 00:17:44.752
But you need to disappear.

170
00:17:46.685 --> 00:17:49.685
I heard you the first time.

171
00:18:10.552 --> 00:18:13.086
So he had a wife and two kids.

172
00:18:16.086 --> 00:18:17.886
He was in the army until a few
years ago.


173
00:18:20.719 --> 00:18:21.852
Served in Afghanistan.

174
00:18:28.986 --> 00:18:30.919
They say war turns people mad.

175
00:18:32.886 --> 00:18:34.619
Or mad people make such wars.

176
00:18:44.619 --> 00:18:45.485
You okay?

177
00:18:46.752 --> 00:18:49.886
Oh yeah, sorry, just
brought back.


178
00:18:51.986 --> 00:18:53.086
Yeah I'm fine.

179
00:19:27.219 --> 00:19:27.986
Police.

180
00:19:28.019 --> 00:19:28.886
Open up.

181
00:19:38.919 --> 00:19:41.852
Mr Sutherland.

182
00:19:53.452 --> 00:19:56.019
Nasty business down the flats.

183
00:19:56.052 --> 00:19:56.986
Not my business.

184
00:19:58.452 --> 00:19:59.119
Oh yeah.

185
00:20:00.186 --> 00:20:03.518
Sure it wasn't one of
your pieces that he used?


186
00:20:03.552 --> 00:20:04.619
You mean yours?

187
00:20:05.619 --> 00:20:08.819
Don't play any fucking
games with me, Farouk.


188
00:20:08.852 --> 00:20:11.086
I assure you, we're not
playing games.


189
00:20:11.119 --> 00:20:12.552
The gun was not from us.

190
00:20:13.752 --> 00:20:14.619
Good.

191
00:20:15.719 --> 00:20:18.052
'Cause the last thing we
need is a fucking holy war.


192
00:20:19.619 --> 00:20:20.485
Right?

193
00:20:26.219 --> 00:20:28.485
Have a nice night,
Mr. Sutherland.


194
00:20:35.585 --> 00:20:36.585
How about him?

195
00:20:38.852 --> 00:20:40.119
Bank robber.

196
00:20:40.152 --> 00:20:41.785
Studying Security Systems.

197
00:20:44.219 --> 00:20:46.019
I bet you're right.

198
00:21:01.518 --> 00:21:03.552
I saw you this morning.

199
00:21:03.585 --> 00:21:04.186
What?

200
00:21:04.219 --> 00:21:05.552
Yeah before the, um,

201
00:21:06.619 --> 00:21:08.652
I walked past you in the flats.

202
00:21:08.685 --> 00:21:10.152
I didn't see you.

203
00:21:10.186 --> 00:21:11.785
I smiled at you.

204
00:21:11.819 --> 00:21:12.886
But you were all like.

205
00:21:19.685 --> 00:21:20.952
I would have smiled back.

206
00:21:30.052 --> 00:21:31.585
What were you listening to?

207
00:21:34.052 --> 00:21:35.552
Just music.

208
00:21:35.585 --> 00:21:37.086
Who?

209
00:21:41.019 --> 00:21:41.919
Mine.

210
00:21:45.552 --> 00:21:48.819
It's just some stuff I make.

211
00:21:49.852 --> 00:21:51.919
Can I hear it?

212
00:21:51.952 --> 00:21:53.052
No.

213
00:21:54.019 --> 00:21:55.685
Well.

214
00:21:55.719 --> 00:22:00.152
Maybe it's just not finished
yet, so.


215
00:22:00.186 --> 00:22:02.619
I don't care, come on.

216
00:22:02.652 --> 00:22:03.518
Please?

217
00:22:06.986 --> 00:22:07.886
All right.

218
00:22:09.752 --> 00:22:12.485
But I mean it's like,

219
00:22:13.719 --> 00:22:15.585
it's not finished or
anything, so.


220
00:22:37.986 --> 00:22:38.852
It's beautiful.

221
00:22:40.485 --> 00:22:41.152
Yeah?

222
00:23:22.119 --> 00:23:24.719
It's been the strangest day.

223
00:23:25.886 --> 00:23:26.752
Yeah.

224
00:23:29.019 --> 00:23:30.019
I woke up yesterday, just

225
00:23:31.719 --> 00:23:34.019
go about buying some dope
and playing my music.


226
00:23:44.986 --> 00:23:46.385
It's my birthday today.

227
00:23:48.819 --> 00:23:49.719
What?

228
00:23:49.752 --> 00:23:50.685
Well, yesterday.

229
00:23:51.585 --> 00:23:52.685
Why didn't you?

230
00:23:55.186 --> 00:23:57.986
Thanks for spending it
with me.


231
00:24:17.986 --> 00:24:19.418
Just doesn't feel right.

232
00:24:20.119 --> 00:24:21.452
Yeah well, we'll see.

233
00:24:25.852 --> 00:24:26.719
Duke.

234
00:24:28.986 --> 00:24:29.852
No.

235
00:24:40.785 --> 00:24:41.986
You right?

236
00:24:43.219 --> 00:24:44.986
Give us a minute, will you,
Perce?


237
00:25:03.652 --> 00:25:05.052
You all right?

238
00:25:05.086 --> 00:25:05.952
Yeah.

239
00:25:06.852 --> 00:25:07.986
What are they gonna do?

240
00:25:12.518 --> 00:25:13.785
You need to clean
this mess up.


241
00:25:13.819 --> 00:25:15.019
I didn't pull the
fucking trigger.


242
00:25:15.052 --> 00:25:17.619
He was one of your
idiot customers.


243
00:25:17.652 --> 00:25:19.752
I told you before about
that stuff.


244
00:25:19.785 --> 00:25:21.485
It makes us a lot of cash.

245
00:25:23.886 --> 00:25:26.119
They were regular
people, they were innocent.


246
00:25:26.152 --> 00:25:28.652
Women and kids, Mrs. Doh
from 87.


247
00:25:28.685 --> 00:25:30.086
Ange, you fucking look at me!

248
00:25:32.152 --> 00:25:33.019
It's done.

249
00:25:34.785 --> 00:25:37.052
The meth stops now, is
that clear?


250
00:25:39.186 --> 00:25:41.086
As the night sky.

251
00:25:41.119 --> 00:25:43.952
That stuff rapes the
bloody soul.


252
00:25:43.986 --> 00:25:44.852
It's gone.

253
00:25:47.052 --> 00:25:50.052
I love you like my own
but I will not hesitate


254
00:25:50.086 --> 00:25:51.518
to bury you myself.

255
00:25:54.019 --> 00:25:54.886
Duke.

256
00:25:56.685 --> 00:25:57.552
You have my word.

257
00:26:01.919 --> 00:26:02.785
Ok.

258
00:26:13.019 --> 00:26:14.652
I'm heading out of town.

259
00:26:17.619 --> 00:26:19.119
For a few months, maybe more.

260
00:26:21.852 --> 00:26:22.685
This'll blow over.

261
00:26:22.719 --> 00:26:24.785
I don't have a choice.

262
00:26:24.819 --> 00:26:25.886
Fucking Sutherland?

263
00:26:25.919 --> 00:26:27.719
No, it's above him.

264
00:26:27.752 --> 00:26:28.852
He's a fucking dog.

265
00:26:28.886 --> 00:26:29.886
Hey, it'll settle.

266
00:26:33.019 --> 00:26:37.652
It'll settle if you give
it a chance to do so.


267
00:26:37.685 --> 00:26:38.819
What?

268
00:26:38.852 --> 00:26:40.785
Well you're in charge
here now.


269
00:26:43.518 --> 00:26:44.585
I don't want it.

270
00:26:44.619 --> 00:26:45.986
I wasn't asking.

271
00:26:48.685 --> 00:26:50.119
It's time to grow up, Angelo.

272
00:26:58.785 --> 00:27:00.752
What about him?

273
00:27:00.785 --> 00:27:03.452
Percy knows his place, hay!

274
00:27:05.152 --> 00:27:06.685
And I know yours.

275
00:27:12.152 --> 00:27:15.086
People are watching, do not fuck
this up.


276
00:27:15.119 --> 00:27:15.986
I won't.

277
00:27:17.552 --> 00:27:19.019
And no phones.

278
00:27:19.919 --> 00:27:22.785
Percy knows where to
find me.


279
00:27:24.886 --> 00:27:27.086
Make sure Ken's family are
looked after.


280
00:27:27.119 --> 00:27:28.886
Of course, of course.

281
00:27:29.819 --> 00:27:31.585
And I never wanna see
him again.


282
00:27:49.752 --> 00:27:50.685
You cool?

283
00:27:56.585 --> 00:27:58.986
Fuck, he's looking old.

284
00:27:59.019 --> 00:27:59.886
Yeah.

285
00:28:12.452 --> 00:28:13.119
Hey.

286
00:28:14.552 --> 00:28:15.752
Hey yourself.

287
00:28:30.052 --> 00:28:31.518
You all right?

288
00:28:34.952 --> 00:28:35.819
Yeah, I'm fine.

289
00:28:41.152 --> 00:28:44.019
You know you could have
actually just taken a holiday.


290
00:28:47.585 --> 00:28:48.452
Yeah.

291
00:28:53.485 --> 00:28:55.019
You right, girl?

292
00:29:07.919 --> 00:29:08.919
Here we are.

293
00:30:41.752 --> 00:30:44.152
What are you gonna call him?

294
00:30:45.152 --> 00:30:47.752
Well she says her name
is Jenna.


295
00:30:47.785 --> 00:30:49.585
It means small bird.

296
00:30:50.518 --> 00:30:52.619
And can she fly?

297
00:30:53.886 --> 00:30:55.119
One day, maybe.

298
00:31:08.086 --> 00:31:09.585
It's beautiful, huh?

299
00:31:09.619 --> 00:31:10.485
Yeah.

300
00:31:12.952 --> 00:31:13.852
Back home when I was a kid

301
00:31:13.886 --> 00:31:16.452
we had his restaurant with an
open roof.


302
00:31:17.919 --> 00:31:19.886
My dad and I would lie on the
tables


303
00:31:19.919 --> 00:31:22.485
and we'd try to count all the
stars.


304
00:31:24.152 --> 00:31:25.019
That's cool.

305
00:31:29.552 --> 00:31:31.552
He died in an attack on
our building.


306
00:31:36.152 --> 00:31:38.485
It was always the four of us,
you know.


307
00:31:38.518 --> 00:31:39.719
Then one day, just three.

308
00:31:45.086 --> 00:31:47.619
Jeez, I'm so sorry.

309
00:31:50.719 --> 00:31:52.852
We lost our father.

310
00:31:52.886 --> 00:31:54.685
My brother almost lost
his sight.


311
00:32:03.552 --> 00:32:05.119
It's been difficult ever since.

312
00:32:11.186 --> 00:32:13.852
This, um, us.

313
00:32:15.019 --> 00:32:16.418
It isn't easy.

314
00:32:18.052 --> 00:32:21.485
My family, they're not as modern
as some.


315
00:32:25.552 --> 00:32:27.886
In my world, we're forbidden.

316
00:32:34.785 --> 00:32:36.652
And how do you feel?

317
00:33:16.886 --> 00:33:18.952
Is that you?

318
00:33:18.986 --> 00:33:19.852
Yeah.

319
00:33:22.719 --> 00:33:24.119
You're adorable.

320
00:33:29.086 --> 00:33:31.619
How long have you lived here?

321
00:33:34.719 --> 00:33:35.585
A while.

322
00:33:38.452 --> 00:33:39.852
Quite a long time.

323
00:34:35.219 --> 00:34:37.019
No one can find us.

324
00:34:38.852 --> 00:34:40.785
I don't care anymore.

325
00:34:57.952 --> 00:35:00.152
Have you been with many
women before?


326
00:35:07.219 --> 00:35:08.086
Hundreds.

327
00:35:13.119 --> 00:35:15.518
I was pretty notorious
at school.


328
00:35:15.552 --> 00:35:16.418
Stop it.

329
00:35:18.585 --> 00:35:19.452
No.

330
00:35:20.952 --> 00:35:24.518
I mean, once, but...

331
00:35:28.119 --> 00:35:29.452
not like this.

332
00:35:32.886 --> 00:35:34.019
Have you ever?

333
00:35:40.019 --> 00:35:41.152
And you don't mind?

334
00:35:43.719 --> 00:35:46.186
I want to, just not yet.

335
00:35:46.219 --> 00:35:47.086
What I want

336
00:35:49.186 --> 00:35:50.785
is to shut my eyes

337
00:35:53.619 --> 00:35:54.619
and when I open them

338
00:35:56.752 --> 00:35:57.619
you're there.

339
00:36:09.719 --> 00:36:12.019
This is the most comfortable
chair I've ever sat in.


340
00:36:14.785 --> 00:36:15.652
On.

341
00:36:16.585 --> 00:36:17.852
Not in, you sit on a chair.

342
00:36:20.019 --> 00:36:21.752
It's nice as all.

343
00:36:23.518 --> 00:36:24.385
Quiet.

344
00:36:26.585 --> 00:36:28.619
A bloke could get used to a
place like this.


345
00:36:33.485 --> 00:36:34.952
Yeah, it's quiet.

346
00:36:36.152 --> 00:36:39.019
Well it would be if
you stopped saying it is.


347
00:36:39.052 --> 00:36:41.019
Well have a look
around though.


348
00:36:41.052 --> 00:36:42.585
It's a bloody castle, mate.

349
00:36:45.152 --> 00:36:48.619
It's a prison,
it's just a fancy one.


350
00:36:48.652 --> 00:36:49.886
Well I'll take it.

351
00:36:49.919 --> 00:36:52.485
Come on, people like
you and me would die


352
00:36:52.518 --> 00:36:54.619
if we had to live in places
like this.


353
00:36:54.652 --> 00:36:56.418
It's too late to change that.

354
00:36:56.452 --> 00:36:57.785
We're from the flats.

355
00:36:59.652 --> 00:37:01.418
And that's where I met
Karen, your mom's there,


356
00:37:01.452 --> 00:37:02.986
it's where Rosie was born.

357
00:37:04.585 --> 00:37:06.119
There's too many memories,
Perce.


358
00:37:09.152 --> 00:37:11.452
I have people who don't
know where they are,


359
00:37:11.485 --> 00:37:12.952
don't know who they are,

360
00:37:12.986 --> 00:37:15.186
they're barely people at all.

361
00:37:15.219 --> 00:37:16.086
Maybe.

362
00:37:18.785 --> 00:37:19.819
Maybe you're right.

363
00:37:19.852 --> 00:37:21.485
I am fucking right.

364
00:37:29.619 --> 00:37:30.552
It was clearly
a goal -


365
00:37:30.585 --> 00:37:33.052
Yeah but I still love
this fucking chair.


366
00:37:43.019 --> 00:37:44.619
Ange!

367
00:37:44.652 --> 00:37:45.518
Shh.

368
00:37:49.819 --> 00:37:52.152
The Flemington boys
are at me.


369
00:37:52.186 --> 00:37:53.518
They want eight ounces.

370
00:37:56.518 --> 00:37:57.719
It's a lot of cash, mate.

371
00:38:01.485 --> 00:38:04.019
Look, things have died down,
all right?


372
00:38:04.052 --> 00:38:05.418
There's no heat anymore.

373
00:38:06.518 --> 00:38:07.552
There's always heat.

374
00:38:08.585 --> 00:38:10.086
Sometimes you just can't see it.

375
00:38:15.819 --> 00:38:18.785
You don't owe him
anything, mate.


376
00:38:18.819 --> 00:38:21.518
All right, you've done your time
and more.


377
00:38:23.719 --> 00:38:24.886
Look at them.

378
00:38:25.986 --> 00:38:27.685
Fucking beautiful little things.

379
00:38:29.452 --> 00:38:30.452
Just swimming about.

380
00:38:33.819 --> 00:38:35.986
Look how they protect and
look after their family.


381
00:38:37.552 --> 00:38:39.186
Yeah.

382
00:38:39.219 --> 00:38:40.086
Yep.

383
00:38:45.119 --> 00:38:47.852
Mate, we're getting left behind.

384
00:38:48.752 --> 00:38:49.619
It's easy money.

385
00:38:55.852 --> 00:38:56.719
Fuck it.

386
00:38:58.886 --> 00:38:59.752
Set it up.

387
00:39:20.685 --> 00:39:23.685
Hey, I got you a little
something.


388
00:39:34.752 --> 00:39:36.685
Farouk, it's Hementh.

389
00:39:37.819 --> 00:39:39.019
See you tonight?

390
00:39:41.785 --> 00:39:43.052
See you tonight?

391
00:40:03.952 --> 00:40:05.619
I was at Uni all day.

392
00:40:05.652 --> 00:40:06.652
Not just today.

393
00:40:08.886 --> 00:40:09.852
Your studies.

394
00:40:12.219 --> 00:40:13.418
Yeah, they're going well.

395
00:40:18.518 --> 00:40:19.986
I'm with friends.

396
00:40:23.052 --> 00:40:24.052
These friends.

397
00:40:38.019 --> 00:40:39.552
I'm happy.

398
00:40:39.585 --> 00:40:40.552
Is that not enough?

399
00:40:42.652 --> 00:40:43.518
Yeah.

400
00:40:46.052 --> 00:40:47.485
You should try it.

401
00:40:57.152 --> 00:40:58.152
Have a good night.

402
00:41:00.052 --> 00:41:00.719
Jaiwara.

403
00:41:09.752 --> 00:41:10.819
His name is Claudio.

404
00:41:15.619 --> 00:41:16.485
Claudio?

405
00:42:00.719 --> 00:42:01.852
I'm serious.

406
00:42:08.119 --> 00:42:09.785
What did he want?

407
00:42:18.019 --> 00:42:20.585
Flemington loved it.

408
00:42:20.619 --> 00:42:21.952
They want double.

409
00:42:25.518 --> 00:42:27.119
You're the boss now Ange.

410
00:42:27.152 --> 00:42:29.752
This is your license to print
your own fucking money.


411
00:42:30.685 --> 00:42:31.919
You see that?

412
00:42:31.952 --> 00:42:32.952
What?

413
00:42:37.652 --> 00:42:39.052
Nothin'

414
00:42:42.485 --> 00:42:44.485
Tell them it's 5 grand
an ounce now.


415
00:42:47.152 --> 00:42:51.719
What ever you think Ange!
What ever you say.


416
00:42:53.119 --> 00:42:55.119
Hey Lukey!

417
00:42:56.819 --> 00:42:58.418
Flood this fucking town.

418
00:43:09.886 --> 00:43:12.619
He reckons loans have
been good.


419
00:43:18.685 --> 00:43:19.752
That's a lot.

420
00:43:22.652 --> 00:43:23.785
Yeah, it is.

421
00:43:26.152 --> 00:43:28.819
She hasn't been eating a thing.

422
00:43:31.819 --> 00:43:34.619
Yeah she's probably
just tired.


423
00:43:41.219 --> 00:43:43.752
But it's spelt Ya'aburnee
Y.A.


424
00:43:45.152 --> 00:43:48.952
No,.

425
00:43:48.986 --> 00:43:52.752
It's a different, yeah, that's
not bad.


426
00:43:52.785 --> 00:43:55.552
And it means, you bury me?

427
00:43:55.585 --> 00:43:56.585
So, Jaiwara.

428
00:44:00.986 --> 00:44:03.452
Are you planning to kill me?

429
00:44:05.685 --> 00:44:07.086
Love me that much?

430
00:44:11.186 --> 00:44:13.119
I was saying...

431
00:44:16.452 --> 00:44:17.886
It means for me to die first

432
00:44:17.919 --> 00:44:20.719
because I can't
live without you.


433
00:44:22.852 --> 00:44:24.652
Not in this lifetime.

434
00:44:29.019 --> 00:44:30.086
I love you.

435
00:44:31.518 --> 00:44:32.518
And I you.

436
00:45:21.152 --> 00:45:21.986
Hey.

437
00:45:26.886 --> 00:45:27.752
Enough!

438
00:45:36.986 --> 00:45:38.785
Do you know who I am?

439
00:45:45.785 --> 00:45:47.986
If you ever see my sister again,

440
00:45:48.019 --> 00:45:50.585
I'll tear your heart
out of your white chest.


441
00:45:59.552 --> 00:46:00.485
It is over.

442
00:46:26.685 --> 00:46:28.485
Long live the king.

443
00:47:14.585 --> 00:47:15.785
I'm so sorry.

444
00:47:20.619 --> 00:47:21.886
They're animals.

445
00:47:25.485 --> 00:47:27.952
You didn't tell me you
brother was Farouk Nassar.


446
00:47:28.852 --> 00:47:29.719
I know, I'm sorry.

447
00:47:32.452 --> 00:47:33.785
Please forgive me.

448
00:47:33.819 --> 00:47:35.086
Farouk Nassar.

449
00:47:39.619 --> 00:47:41.619
How can we ever be together?

450
00:47:44.518 --> 00:47:46.119
I tried, I tried to
tell you on the beach.


451
00:47:46.152 --> 00:47:47.019
You didn't.

452
00:48:07.485 --> 00:48:09.852
Last time I was in a church
was my mom's funeral.


453
00:48:13.719 --> 00:48:14.585
Her death, it,

454
00:48:17.485 --> 00:48:18.719
it ruined my father.

455
00:48:21.752 --> 00:48:24.052
The day I finished high
school he hung himself.


456
00:48:30.186 --> 00:48:31.052
How stupid.

457
00:48:47.485 --> 00:48:48.619
Let's leave.

458
00:48:50.752 --> 00:48:51.852
Let's go away.

459
00:48:51.886 --> 00:48:53.086
Together, you and me.

460
00:48:59.186 --> 00:49:00.785
Trust me, Claudio.

461
00:49:38.919 --> 00:49:41.385
Here he is, the silly boy.

462
00:49:47.819 --> 00:49:48.952
Ah, look what I found.

463
00:49:51.186 --> 00:49:52.886
Now that is a serious crime.

464
00:49:56.685 --> 00:49:59.086
And you're gonna do serious
years because of it.


465
00:50:01.152 --> 00:50:03.852
Should have just left her alone.

466
00:50:26.819 --> 00:50:28.652
It's about your boyfriend.

467
00:50:29.785 --> 00:50:30.652
Come.

468
00:50:42.585 --> 00:50:44.385
What have you done?

469
00:50:46.886 --> 00:50:48.152
Where's ameh?

470
00:50:48.186 --> 00:50:50.052
She's saving her face
elsewhere.


471
00:50:55.152 --> 00:50:57.019
I told her I wanted to speak to
you alone.


472
00:50:57.052 --> 00:50:57.919
Sit!

473
00:51:12.585 --> 00:51:13.986
Where's Claudio?

474
00:51:16.485 --> 00:51:18.986
Your boyfriend is safe
but gone.


475
00:51:19.019 --> 00:51:20.785
You will not see him again.

476
00:51:20.819 --> 00:51:24.086
Farouk, please, please.

477
00:51:24.119 --> 00:51:26.685
I'm begging you please.

478
00:51:26.719 --> 00:51:27.719
It cannot be.

479
00:51:27.752 --> 00:51:29.452
But it's not his fault

480
00:51:29.485 --> 00:51:30.452
but our hearts.

481
00:51:30.485 --> 00:51:31.452
I cannot.

482
00:51:31.485 --> 00:51:32.819
You will not.

483
00:51:32.852 --> 00:51:34.152
Either way, this is over!

484
00:51:36.452 --> 00:51:37.685
Fuck! fucking thing!

485
00:52:05.219 --> 00:52:06.719
You are so like our father.

486
00:52:07.986 --> 00:52:09.418
You're nothing like him.

487
00:52:19.585 --> 00:52:22.619
I should have been there
more for you.


488
00:52:22.652 --> 00:52:23.886
For that I am sorry.

489
00:52:25.919 --> 00:52:27.052
You thought that Allah
has taken your eyes


490
00:52:27.086 --> 00:52:29.119
so that you can see what
you've become.


491
00:52:30.485 --> 00:52:33.418
I do not presume to
understand Allah or you.


492
00:52:35.186 --> 00:52:37.518
My eyes saw the look on our
mother's face


493
00:52:37.552 --> 00:52:38.919
when she heard of your shame.

494
00:52:41.152 --> 00:52:42.019
Really?

495
00:52:43.518 --> 00:52:44.952
Perhaps because it came
from you.


496
00:52:44.986 --> 00:52:46.585
She needed to know.

497
00:52:47.619 --> 00:52:50.086
You lie again, Farouk.

498
00:52:51.485 --> 00:52:52.253
I'd already told her.

499
00:52:52.286 --> 00:52:56.418
Jaiwara, believe me,
it is over.


500
00:53:37.019 --> 00:53:38.152
Can I help you?

501
00:53:42.186 --> 00:53:43.685
I don't think so, thanks.

502
00:53:52.052 --> 00:53:54.152
Come on, princess.

503
00:53:54.186 --> 00:53:56.152
Your request has finally been
approved.


504
00:54:06.752 --> 00:54:08.019
You've become very popular.

505
00:54:32.652 --> 00:54:33.652
Hello?

506
00:54:33.685 --> 00:54:34.819
Hey.

507
00:54:34.852 --> 00:54:36.518
It's me.

508
00:54:36.552 --> 00:54:38.086
Listen, I've only got two
minutes.


509
00:54:39.086 --> 00:54:40.052
I'm in prison.

510
00:54:40.086 --> 00:54:41.052
I know.

511
00:54:41.086 --> 00:54:43.752
It took me days to even
find out where you were


512
00:54:43.785 --> 00:54:45.919
and then they wouldn't
let me through to you.


513
00:54:45.952 --> 00:54:46.919
I got you a lawyer.

514
00:54:47.919 --> 00:54:49.619
What can they do for me?

515
00:54:49.652 --> 00:54:53.152
Look, I didn't even do this yet
here I am.


516
00:54:53.186 --> 00:54:55.052
Yeah, I'm trying everything I
can.


517
00:54:57.518 --> 00:54:58.752
Your brother put me in here.

518
00:55:03.886 --> 00:55:05.518
I need you to do one
thing for me.


519
00:55:05.552 --> 00:55:06.418
Anything.

520
00:55:07.886 --> 00:55:09.919
Have you heard of a man
named Duke?


521
00:55:10.952 --> 00:55:12.518
He could help me.

522
00:55:12.552 --> 00:55:13.886
Yeah I've heard of him.

523
00:55:13.919 --> 00:55:15.052
Okay, find him.

524
00:55:16.719 --> 00:55:18.752
Tell him I'm the
doctor's grandson.


525
00:55:21.819 --> 00:55:22.886
I have to go.

526
00:55:24.752 --> 00:55:26.385
I love you Jaiwara.

527
00:55:28.019 --> 00:55:29.119
Claudio?

528
00:55:29.152 --> 00:55:30.019
Claudio!

529
00:55:36.852 --> 00:55:38.752
He's not here,
darling.


530
00:55:38.785 --> 00:55:39.652
It's urgent.

531
00:55:42.619 --> 00:55:44.619
Can't you hear me
under that fucking thing?


532
00:55:44.652 --> 00:55:45.685
I said he's not here.

533
00:55:48.152 --> 00:55:49.652
She wants to see Duke, mate.

534
00:55:51.919 --> 00:55:52.785
Come through.

535
00:56:00.219 --> 00:56:01.086
Thanks.

536
00:56:09.552 --> 00:56:11.719
Would you like a drink?

537
00:56:11.752 --> 00:56:12.852
I need to see Duke.

538
00:56:13.752 --> 00:56:14.619
Need?

539
00:56:17.019 --> 00:56:17.886
That's eager.

540
00:56:20.986 --> 00:56:22.619
My name is Jaiwara Nassar.

541
00:56:25.719 --> 00:56:27.119
Do you know who my brother is?

542
00:56:31.852 --> 00:56:33.986
I know who your brother is

543
00:56:34.019 --> 00:56:35.052
and yet you are here.

544
00:56:39.919 --> 00:56:40.785
Duke's on holiday

545
00:56:42.052 --> 00:56:44.852
but I have his ear and you have
mine.


546
00:56:49.119 --> 00:56:51.452
My boyfriend Claudio
was arrested.


547
00:56:51.485 --> 00:56:52.852
He was charged with possession.

548
00:56:52.886 --> 00:56:53.919
It doesn't matter.

549
00:56:55.952 --> 00:56:57.752
I can assure you
he's innocent.


550
00:56:57.785 --> 00:56:58.652
Well.

551
00:57:00.086 --> 00:57:01.886
We all started out innocent.

552
00:57:09.919 --> 00:57:10.785
Eyelash.

553
00:57:20.719 --> 00:57:21.685
Do you love him?

554
00:57:23.785 --> 00:57:25.886
So will you talk to Duke?

555
00:57:25.919 --> 00:57:26.785
Yeah.

556
00:57:27.619 --> 00:57:29.652
We can help you and
your boyfriend.


557
00:57:31.152 --> 00:57:32.019
Really?

558
00:57:36.152 --> 00:57:38.518
Thank you.

559
00:57:38.552 --> 00:57:40.418
Oh, thank you, thank you
so much.


560
00:57:42.086 --> 00:57:43.052
One other thing.

561
00:57:44.119 --> 00:57:46.785
My brother must never know
that I've come to you.


562
00:57:49.086 --> 00:57:49.952
I agree.

563
00:57:55.485 --> 00:57:56.986
But we're not done yet,
Jaiwara.


564
00:58:23.086 --> 00:58:25.186
Help, help me!

565
00:58:25.219 --> 00:58:26.585
Come on!
Oy, help!


566
00:58:26.619 --> 00:58:27.485
Help!

567
00:58:32.986 --> 00:58:34.919
This won't hurt a bit.

568
00:58:34.952 --> 00:58:36.785
Oh fuck no!

569
00:58:36.819 --> 00:58:37.685
Leave.

570
00:58:39.852 --> 00:58:40.719
Now!

571
00:58:54.019 --> 00:58:56.052
Farouk wants you alive for now.

572
01:00:15.485 --> 01:00:16.485
And stop.

573
01:00:18.585 --> 01:00:19.485
Go from here.

574
01:00:29.652 --> 01:00:30.518
The other one.

575
01:00:31.752 --> 01:00:33.119
Pause it.

576
01:00:35.719 --> 01:00:36.785
You see?

577
01:00:36.819 --> 01:00:38.019
It's her, I told you.

578
01:00:46.585 --> 01:00:49.585
What the fuck's he doing
with her?


579
01:00:58.752 --> 01:01:01.819
I'll leave you two
lovebirds alone.


580
01:01:29.819 --> 01:01:31.886
It's all right.

581
01:01:31.919 --> 01:01:33.452
It's okay.

582
01:01:34.186 --> 01:01:35.585
It's all right.

583
01:01:45.886 --> 01:01:48.619
Did Duke remember my
grandfather?


584
01:01:49.986 --> 01:01:51.186
He's away.

585
01:01:51.219 --> 01:01:52.952
I spoke with a man called
Angelo.


586
01:01:54.052 --> 01:01:55.152
And what did he say?

587
01:01:58.518 --> 01:01:59.418
He's the devil.

588
01:02:04.785 --> 01:02:06.452
So no one can help me then.

589
01:02:06.485 --> 01:02:07.685
Look, I'll try Farouk again.

590
01:02:07.719 --> 01:02:08.886
I'll make him see sense.

591
01:02:08.919 --> 01:02:09.752
Fuck your brother!

592
01:02:09.785 --> 01:02:10.886
He put me in here!

593
01:02:15.119 --> 01:02:17.152
What happened with this man,
Angelo?


594
01:02:21.119 --> 01:02:21.986
Tell me.

595
01:02:25.619 --> 01:02:28.886
He promised your release if,
um...


596
01:02:30.119 --> 01:02:31.719
What Jaiwara, what?

597
01:02:36.052 --> 01:02:38.652
Look at me, I'm dying in here.

598
01:02:41.019 --> 01:02:43.986
He said he could help you if
he could help himself to me.


599
01:02:55.219 --> 01:02:58.385
I pray every day for us to
wake from this nightmare.


600
01:03:03.785 --> 01:03:05.785
It'll kill me in here.

601
01:03:06.919 --> 01:03:07.785
I know it.

602
01:03:09.919 --> 01:03:12.052
Farouk has men everywhere.

603
01:03:23.186 --> 01:03:24.652
I can't do this.

604
01:03:41.986 --> 01:03:43.452
I'm begging you.

605
01:03:48.552 --> 01:03:49.752
Do this for me.

606
01:03:52.785 --> 01:03:57.785
You're all I have now.

607
01:04:20.952 --> 01:04:22.418
Jaiwara?

608
01:04:27.119 --> 01:04:28.385
Are you okay?

609
01:04:30.852 --> 01:04:32.852
No, I'm not.

610
01:04:38.752 --> 01:04:40.852
You know what's wrong
but you do nothing.


611
01:04:41.852 --> 01:04:43.518
He is not worth your tears.

612
01:04:45.019 --> 01:04:46.886
I know he goes with the
wrong people.


613
01:04:48.186 --> 01:04:49.886
He's innocent.

614
01:04:51.186 --> 01:04:52.485
Farouk?

615
01:04:52.518 --> 01:04:53.385
Farouk did this.

616
01:04:54.919 --> 01:04:56.819
The boy is in the prison,
Jaiwara.


617
01:04:56.852 --> 01:04:59.986
Stop lying to yourself!

618
01:05:00.019 --> 01:05:03.719
You know, you know what your
precious son is capable of.


619
01:05:03.752 --> 01:05:05.685
Are you gonna bury
your head again?


620
01:05:05.719 --> 01:05:06.552
Wake up!

621
01:05:06.585 --> 01:05:09.186
No wait, no, please.

622
01:05:09.219 --> 01:05:10.852
Please.

623
01:05:10.886 --> 01:05:12.086
Please, I need your help.

624
01:05:14.719 --> 01:05:15.585
Please.

625
01:05:18.119 --> 01:05:18.986
Talk to him.

626
01:05:20.719 --> 01:05:23.685
He'll listen to you,
I know he will.


627
01:05:23.719 --> 01:05:24.585
Please.

628
01:05:25.685 --> 01:05:27.886
I am only worried what you
would do.


629
01:05:29.119 --> 01:05:30.652
Not Farouk.

630
01:05:42.019 --> 01:05:44.418
Allah?

631
01:05:45.752 --> 01:05:47.019
Allah, everyday.

632
01:05:48.452 --> 01:05:50.518
Every single day.

633
01:05:52.452 --> 01:05:55.152
Sometimes his directions
are not clear.


634
01:06:04.852 --> 01:06:09.719
I know that my father,
your husband,


635
01:06:09.752 --> 01:06:12.518
he'd be disappointed in what
we've become.


636
01:06:16.685 --> 01:06:18.086
And I know what he would do.

637
01:06:43.919 --> 01:06:45.919
Jaiwara

638
01:06:58.219 --> 01:06:59.418
You're Duke?

639
01:07:00.719 --> 01:07:01.585
I am.

640
01:07:05.952 --> 01:07:07.119
Is he with you?

641
01:07:07.152 --> 01:07:08.719
Who?

642
01:07:08.752 --> 01:07:09.585
Angelo.

643
01:07:09.619 --> 01:07:11.019
No, no.

644
01:07:11.052 --> 01:07:11.919
It's just us.

645
01:07:17.452 --> 01:07:18.719
You're safe.

646
01:07:18.752 --> 01:07:19.986
You have my word.

647
01:07:25.986 --> 01:07:26.852
Please.

648
01:07:39.619 --> 01:07:41.752
Every day I see
less and less.


649
01:07:42.819 --> 01:07:45.186
In six months, it will be
gone completely.


650
01:07:45.219 --> 01:07:46.986
You have tried everything?

651
01:07:47.019 --> 01:07:49.152
Maybe there is another
operation.


652
01:07:49.186 --> 01:07:50.785
It's too late.

653
01:07:50.819 --> 01:07:52.819
It's when I became too stubborn.

654
01:07:52.852 --> 01:07:54.452
You, never.

655
01:07:58.452 --> 01:07:59.119
How is she?

656
01:08:01.186 --> 01:08:02.619
She is upset still.

657
01:08:04.186 --> 01:08:05.719
What will you do with her?

658
01:08:06.719 --> 01:08:09.452
I will love her
forever, always.


659
01:08:09.485 --> 01:08:11.452
They are
unnatural together.


660
01:08:15.152 --> 01:08:18.385
This here is not my home.

661
01:08:19.719 --> 01:08:20.585
Our home.

662
01:08:21.685 --> 01:08:22.752
And yet here we are.

663
01:08:24.819 --> 01:08:26.752
To know what is natural
is a luxury


664
01:08:26.785 --> 01:08:28.385
that wore off long ago.

665
01:08:34.518 --> 01:08:36.552
You'll drive her away from us.

666
01:08:38.719 --> 01:08:41.585
And I will be left with
a blind and stubborn son.


667
01:08:44.052 --> 01:08:46.452
So when you ask me what
I will do,


668
01:08:48.785 --> 01:08:52.552
all I think is what is
it that you will do.


669
01:08:59.886 --> 01:09:02.585
And what did Angelo ask
for in return?


670
01:09:04.152 --> 01:09:05.585
Was it money?

671
01:09:07.619 --> 01:09:09.752
He asked much more than that.

672
01:09:13.752 --> 01:09:15.819
I just prefer not to say.

673
01:09:16.785 --> 01:09:18.552
Okay, but I do need to know.

674
01:09:24.585 --> 01:09:25.719
He said I could get
Claudio out


675
01:09:25.752 --> 01:09:29.385
if I spent the night with him.

676
01:09:42.919 --> 01:09:44.919
I'm so sorry, my dear.

677
01:09:49.186 --> 01:09:52.819
I knew Claudio's
grandfather briefly.


678
01:09:52.852 --> 01:09:54.752
But sometimes it's enough.

679
01:09:56.452 --> 01:09:58.119
So you'll help him?

680
01:09:58.152 --> 01:10:00.152
Why did your brother put him
in there?


681
01:10:06.919 --> 01:10:08.719
Because I love him.

682
01:10:10.719 --> 01:10:11.585
Ah.

683
01:10:18.152 --> 01:10:21.452
Well your brother and I
have managed to mainly


684
01:10:21.485 --> 01:10:22.785
avoid each other over the years,

685
01:10:22.819 --> 01:10:24.152
and to be perfectly frank,
my dear,


686
01:10:24.186 --> 01:10:26.418
I'd prefer to keep it that way.

687
01:10:26.452 --> 01:10:27.986
That I understand.

688
01:10:37.652 --> 01:10:38.518
So?

689
01:10:40.219 --> 01:10:42.986
How are we gonna solve
your little problem?


690
01:10:53.719 --> 01:10:54.719
Good.

691
01:11:07.819 --> 01:11:09.619
I have to get this.

692
01:11:17.652 --> 01:11:18.819
Hi.

693
01:11:18.852 --> 01:11:20.086
Are you okay?

694
01:11:20.119 --> 01:11:23.119
What I asked you, I didn't
mean it.


695
01:11:24.852 --> 01:11:25.719
I was scared.

696
01:11:28.152 --> 01:11:29.019
Forgive me.

697
01:11:31.186 --> 01:11:34.086
Please forgive me, Jaiwara.

698
01:11:34.119 --> 01:11:35.585
I already have.

699
01:11:41.719 --> 01:11:43.152
It's nice to hear your voice.

700
01:11:45.219 --> 01:11:46.385
I'm so lost.

701
01:11:50.819 --> 01:11:52.785
I despise not seeing you.

702
01:11:52.819 --> 01:11:55.385
I see you every day.

703
01:11:56.119 --> 01:11:57.819
We're meant to be together.

704
01:11:59.485 --> 01:12:01.852
In this life or next,
we will be.


705
01:12:05.086 --> 01:12:06.652
Listen.

706
01:12:06.685 --> 01:12:07.785
I met with Duke, and...

707
01:12:12.685 --> 01:12:13.619
He's helping us.

708
01:12:19.886 --> 01:12:20.886
What do you think?

709
01:12:22.952 --> 01:12:24.019
Brand new.

710
01:12:24.952 --> 01:12:26.086
My feet are killing me.

711
01:12:30.518 --> 01:12:32.485
Well, you gotta suffer for
your art.


712
01:12:42.086 --> 01:12:42.952
They're lovely.

713
01:12:44.886 --> 01:12:46.019
You know my whole life,

714
01:12:47.119 --> 01:12:48.518
I never had anything new.

715
01:12:49.919 --> 01:12:51.152
It's always hand me downs.

716
01:12:52.552 --> 01:12:55.619
Till one day, my mum,

717
01:12:56.852 --> 01:12:57.785
she got me this

718
01:12:59.152 --> 01:13:03.152
bright, shiny new bike.

719
01:13:06.685 --> 01:13:08.152
It's for my birthday.

720
01:13:12.086 --> 01:13:12.952
God.

721
01:13:14.052 --> 01:13:16.485
She must have scrimped
and saved.


722
01:13:20.518 --> 01:13:22.852
These days I can have
anything I fucking look at.


723
01:13:27.119 --> 01:13:27.919
I'd give it all back

724
01:13:29.986 --> 01:13:31.785
to feel the way I've felt
that day.


725
01:13:35.518 --> 01:13:36.385
That's really sweet.

726
01:13:40.019 --> 01:13:42.119
What do you think
happens when we're done?


727
01:13:45.785 --> 01:13:47.986
We fuck, you come.

728
01:13:49.552 --> 01:13:50.585
You hate yourself.

729
01:13:52.485 --> 01:13:54.019
We sleep, we wake.

730
01:13:56.086 --> 01:13:57.119
This is it, Ange.

731
01:13:58.452 --> 01:14:00.752
One life, one God.

732
01:14:03.086 --> 01:14:04.052
Or no God.

733
01:14:05.852 --> 01:14:06.719
This is it.

734
01:14:17.485 --> 01:14:18.152
Hello?

735
01:14:18.186 --> 01:14:19.152
It's Jaiwara.

736
01:14:23.652 --> 01:14:25.585
Oh, hello.

737
01:14:28.119 --> 01:14:28.986
Can you
guarantee Claudio's release?


738
01:14:32.086 --> 01:14:33.619
I can.

739
01:14:34.518 --> 01:14:35.385
How?

740
01:14:36.919 --> 01:14:37.785
Easily.

741
01:14:38.919 --> 01:14:40.119
You came to us, remember?

742
01:14:44.052 --> 01:14:44.986
Tomorrow night.

743
01:14:46.852 --> 01:14:48.186
Okay.

744
01:14:48.219 --> 01:14:50.952
No one can know.

745
01:14:50.986 --> 01:14:52.052
It'll be our secret.

746
01:15:04.518 --> 01:15:05.485
Maybe you're right.

747
01:15:06.952 --> 01:15:07.819
About what?

748
01:15:10.619 --> 01:15:11.685
There is no God.

749
01:15:46.552 --> 01:15:48.752
Hey, Duke.

750
01:15:49.886 --> 01:15:50.752
How are you?

751
01:15:51.652 --> 01:15:52.585
How's it going?

752
01:15:54.186 --> 01:15:55.919
It's fine.

753
01:15:55.952 --> 01:15:56.819
I'm fine.

754
01:16:04.685 --> 01:16:05.518
Duke?

755
01:16:05.552 --> 01:16:06.418
Yeah?

756
01:16:09.152 --> 01:16:11.086
When you coming home?

757
01:16:12.186 --> 01:16:13.052
I miss you.

758
01:16:15.452 --> 01:16:17.019
Ah, soon, I'm not far away.

759
01:16:20.752 --> 01:16:21.819
You behaving?

760
01:16:23.152 --> 01:16:24.019
Yeah.

761
01:16:25.785 --> 01:16:26.819
I've been a good boy.

762
01:16:28.552 --> 01:16:29.785
Angelo, listen to me,

763
01:16:29.819 --> 01:16:31.119
you pull your fucking head in

764
01:16:31.152 --> 01:16:33.086
before someone pulls it
from you.


765
01:16:37.052 --> 01:16:41.452
And is there anything you need
to tell me?


766
01:16:41.485 --> 01:16:42.152
Nah.

767
01:16:45.485 --> 01:16:46.485
It's just...

768
01:16:48.518 --> 01:16:49.518
Just what?

769
01:16:53.052 --> 01:16:55.652
Just you come home soon, eh?

770
01:17:08.619 --> 01:17:10.418
Hey, shh, shh, shh.

771
01:18:14.152 --> 01:18:16.019
Take off my clothes.

772
01:21:39.986 --> 01:21:41.518
So no problems?

773
01:21:43.685 --> 01:21:45.019
He couldn't move a muscle.

774
01:21:48.186 --> 01:21:49.152
And Jaiwara?

775
01:21:50.619 --> 01:21:52.019
Life.

776
01:21:52.052 --> 01:21:53.452
She was only there for
a minute,


777
01:21:53.485 --> 01:21:54.819
I didn't leave her side.

778
01:21:55.752 --> 01:21:58.086
Just close your eyes.

779
01:21:58.119 --> 01:21:59.652
Okay?

780
01:21:59.685 --> 01:22:00.552
Yeah.

781
01:22:02.119 --> 01:22:04.518
I didn't think he'd go
through with it.


782
01:22:07.452 --> 01:22:09.186
Why didn't you just get the
kid out?


783
01:22:09.219 --> 01:22:10.719
I left Angelo in charge!

784
01:22:13.719 --> 01:22:15.585
I was hoping he'd do the
right thing.


785
01:22:18.986 --> 01:22:20.119
What're you gonna do?

786
01:22:20.152 --> 01:22:21.552
I don't know.

787
01:22:26.652 --> 01:22:29.619
I mean he gave up five years
of his life.


788
01:22:29.652 --> 01:22:30.652
Took the rap for me.

789
01:22:33.119 --> 01:22:34.785
And I've been looking
after him ever since.


790
01:22:34.819 --> 01:22:35.952
I know.

791
01:22:39.186 --> 01:22:41.719
And we all cross the
line sometimes.


792
01:22:43.152 --> 01:22:44.652
There's still a bloody line!

793
01:22:45.619 --> 01:22:46.552
There is.

794
01:22:46.585 --> 01:22:49.886
And he keeps fucking
crossing it.


795
01:22:51.785 --> 01:22:53.685
He's breaking my bloody heart!

796
01:23:02.952 --> 01:23:05.752
What's going on Stan?

797
01:23:30.785 --> 01:23:31.919
What about treatment?

798
01:23:33.919 --> 01:23:34.785
Yeah.

799
01:23:36.852 --> 01:23:38.585
Not their treatment.

800
01:23:48.552 --> 01:23:50.552
Who needs Duke?

801
01:23:50.585 --> 01:23:53.152
We do what we fucking
want from now on, Ange.


802
01:23:53.186 --> 01:23:54.518
This is our town, mate.

803
01:24:02.619 --> 01:24:03.485
You all right?

804
01:24:09.785 --> 01:24:11.919
You have a big night
or something?


805
01:24:11.952 --> 01:24:16.052
Yeah, yeah, big night.

806
01:24:21.552 --> 01:24:24.886
I don't remember a fucking
thing, except,


807
01:24:30.219 --> 01:24:31.785
that I'm going to hell.

808
01:24:35.019 --> 01:24:36.019
What are you talking about?

809
01:24:36.052 --> 01:24:37.652
See you there.

810
01:25:06.585 --> 01:25:07.385
If I ever see you around
here again


811
01:25:07.418 --> 01:25:09.385
I'll fucking kill you,
you hear me?


812
01:25:36.886 --> 01:25:38.485
You know who I am?

813
01:25:39.819 --> 01:25:41.152
Why are you here?

814
01:25:42.452 --> 01:25:45.552
Salvation, mine.

815
01:25:47.086 --> 01:25:48.852
Yours, perhaps.

816
01:26:04.019 --> 01:26:05.719
I slept with Jaiwara.

817
01:26:08.052 --> 01:26:10.819
You know it's actually quite
impressive, what she did.


818
01:26:14.785 --> 01:26:17.886
I mean she must really
love you, Claudio.


819
01:26:24.119 --> 01:26:25.019
She would never!

820
01:26:25.052 --> 01:26:25.919
She did.

821
01:26:27.752 --> 01:26:29.652
She couldn't, for her
good is the sum of her!


822
01:26:29.685 --> 01:26:31.952
Her good is the sum of her?

823
01:26:31.986 --> 01:26:33.919
What the fuck does that
even mean?


824
01:26:35.452 --> 01:26:37.719
Ah, you're just a fucking kid.

825
01:26:38.685 --> 01:26:39.919
I know what you asked of her.

826
01:26:39.952 --> 01:26:40.886
So she told you.

827
01:26:42.785 --> 01:26:43.719
Of course she did.

828
01:26:44.952 --> 01:26:45.919
And what did you say?

829
01:26:48.986 --> 01:26:52.385
Ah.

830
01:26:53.452 --> 01:26:55.052
Yet you judge me.

831
01:26:58.819 --> 01:27:00.152
Yet you judge me.

832
01:27:06.886 --> 01:27:07.752
Enough.

833
01:27:14.019 --> 01:27:17.986
I can assure you, what Angelo
thinks happened, did not.


834
01:27:19.119 --> 01:27:20.719
Why are you showing me this?

835
01:27:33.719 --> 01:27:34.719
Years ago,

836
01:27:36.485 --> 01:27:40.052
my wife and my daughter were
taken from me


837
01:27:40.086 --> 01:27:42.418
by a drunk in a car.

838
01:27:44.752 --> 01:27:46.119
They were torn to pieces.

839
01:27:47.852 --> 01:27:49.052
But he survived.

840
01:27:51.019 --> 01:27:52.685
So I delivered my own justice.

841
01:27:56.219 --> 01:27:59.485
My bullets were witnessed by an
old man


842
01:27:59.518 --> 01:28:00.652
who was a doctor.

843
01:28:02.152 --> 01:28:03.952
I got to him before the police.

844
01:28:04.986 --> 01:28:06.852
He saw the pain that I was in.

845
01:28:08.552 --> 01:28:10.385
And when he was finally
questioned,


846
01:28:11.719 --> 01:28:13.785
he chose to turn a blind eye.

847
01:28:13.819 --> 01:28:15.819
Now here was a man who
dealt in life and death


848
01:28:15.852 --> 01:28:17.619
but he understood that at times,

849
01:28:17.652 --> 01:28:19.619
vengeance is all we have.

850
01:28:24.019 --> 01:28:27.585
That boy in prison is
his grandson.


851
01:28:29.219 --> 01:28:31.752
And I cannot shut my eyes to it.

852
01:28:35.119 --> 01:28:36.819
What exactly are you
asking of me?


853
01:28:38.919 --> 01:28:41.752
I'm asking you to release him.

854
01:28:41.785 --> 01:28:44.752
I mean I could do so but
out of respect,


855
01:28:44.785 --> 01:28:45.752
I'm talking to you.

856
01:28:50.219 --> 01:28:51.919
You understand what
this means?


857
01:28:58.552 --> 01:29:00.152
Angelo is like a son to me.

858
01:29:02.585 --> 01:29:04.385
So none of this comes lightly.

859
01:29:07.619 --> 01:29:08.952
Do I understand you?

860
01:29:08.986 --> 01:29:09.852
Clearly.

861
01:29:12.219 --> 01:29:13.086
Absolutely.

862
01:29:31.119 --> 01:29:31.986
Your daughter.

863
01:29:34.785 --> 01:29:35.719
What was her name?

864
01:29:39.619 --> 01:29:40.485
Rose.

865
01:30:13.986 --> 01:30:15.652
So, you are free.

866
01:30:18.585 --> 01:30:19.452
Apparently not.

867
01:30:21.485 --> 01:30:23.585
Someone reached out to me

868
01:30:23.619 --> 01:30:25.086
which is why you still breathe.

869
01:30:25.119 --> 01:30:27.719
But believe me, if you see
my sister again


870
01:30:27.752 --> 01:30:29.652
you will die in this prison.

871
01:30:29.685 --> 01:30:30.852
Then send me back now.

872
01:30:35.819 --> 01:30:37.452
I love her.

873
01:30:37.485 --> 01:30:38.152
As do I!

874
01:30:39.152 --> 01:30:40.886
Which is why you're still here.

875
01:30:42.852 --> 01:30:45.485
If you truly love her
then disappear.


876
01:30:45.518 --> 01:30:46.585
Never.

877
01:31:03.552 --> 01:31:04.752
Farouk!

878
01:31:25.619 --> 01:31:26.619
Oh!

879
01:31:26.652 --> 01:31:27.518
Oh god!

880
01:31:38.052 --> 01:31:39.685
Both of you, in the car!

881
01:31:42.652 --> 01:31:43.518
Do not test me!

882
01:31:58.518 --> 01:32:00.585
Farouk, where are we going?

883
01:32:22.052 --> 01:32:22.919
Farouk?

884
01:32:25.719 --> 01:32:29.518
Please, please, I'm begging
you please.


885
01:32:29.552 --> 01:32:31.119
You don't have to do this.

886
01:32:40.086 --> 01:32:41.585
Just look at me, okay?

887
01:32:41.619 --> 01:32:42.886
Just look at me.

888
01:32:45.752 --> 01:32:48.086
We fell in love, that's all!

889
01:33:34.652 --> 01:33:38.052
Please, please,
don't do this.


890
01:33:39.552 --> 01:33:40.852
Please!

891
01:33:40.886 --> 01:33:43.019
- You're my sister.
- Yes!


892
01:33:44.219 --> 01:33:46.886
- I love you.
- Yes, I love you.


893
01:33:48.518 --> 01:33:49.152
This cannot be.

894
01:33:53.619 --> 01:33:54.452
Out.

895
01:33:54.485 --> 01:33:55.119
No, no.

896
01:33:55.152 --> 01:33:56.552
Get out!

897
01:34:15.752 --> 01:34:17.119
Drive.

898
01:34:52.585 --> 01:34:54.052
Easy, Ange.

899
01:35:00.186 --> 01:35:01.052
Duke.

900
01:35:05.152 --> 01:35:06.019
Good to see you.

901
01:35:14.819 --> 01:35:16.886
What you doing up here?

902
01:35:18.719 --> 01:35:19.585
Just...

903
01:35:29.518 --> 01:35:30.886
Got that for you.

904
01:35:40.086 --> 01:35:40.952
Thanks.

905
01:35:44.886 --> 01:35:45.752
Drink?

906
01:35:51.186 --> 01:35:52.052
Sure.

907
01:36:08.919 --> 01:36:11.019
I've watched this city changed
so much.


908
01:36:19.019 --> 01:36:20.752
I fucked up, Duke.

909
01:36:22.019 --> 01:36:22.886
Yeah.

910
01:36:25.719 --> 01:36:26.585
Now.

911
01:36:35.485 --> 01:36:37.952
I fucked up pretty bad.

912
01:36:40.719 --> 01:36:41.785
They're gonna kill me.

913
01:36:44.186 --> 01:36:45.119
You need sleep.

914
01:36:54.485 --> 01:36:55.785
Do you forgive me, Duke?

915
01:36:57.186 --> 01:36:59.485
Come downstairs, we'll sort it
all out.


916
01:37:02.619 --> 01:37:04.152
Do you forgive me?

917
01:37:07.752 --> 01:37:09.819
I already have, Angelo.

918
01:37:14.052 --> 01:37:15.452
I already have.

919
01:37:38.752 --> 01:37:40.086
You coming?

920
01:37:40.119 --> 01:37:40.986
Yeah.

921
01:37:46.552 --> 01:37:48.418
I'll be down in a sec.

922
01:37:54.619 --> 01:37:55.485
Okay.

923
01:37:57.552 --> 01:37:58.952
I'll see you soon.

924
01:38:27.119 --> 01:38:28.052
Ah, fuck!

925
01:38:29.852 --> 01:38:30.719
Fuck!

926
01:38:31.886 --> 01:38:32.752
Fuck!

927
01:41:03.619 --> 01:41:05.619
Look after my Jaiwara.

928
01:41:07.119 --> 01:41:07.785
I will.

929
01:41:19.652 --> 01:41:21.919
We'll see each other soon.

930
01:42:58.919 --> 01:42:59.785
Thank You

931
01:43:46.609 --> 01:43:51.609
