Pardon me. Are you Maria Williams?

21
00:06:02.175 --> 00:06:04.588
- Yes, I am.
- Oh, I'm Anita Hutchins.


22
00:06:04.677 --> 00:06:05.677
- Hi.
- Hi.


23
00:06:05.762 --> 00:06:07.424
Mr. Burgoyne sent me down to meet you.

24
00:06:07.514 --> 00:06:08.675
- I'm with the agency.
- Oh.


25
00:06:08.765 --> 00:06:10.802
- Here, let me take your bag.
- Thank you.


26
00:06:13.937 --> 00:06:15.849
We're over here. Come on.

27
00:06:45.093 --> 00:06:47.460
- This is your apartment?
- You like it?


28
00:06:47.554 --> 00:06:49.546
I'm awed!

29
00:06:49.639 --> 00:06:51.426
Secretaries live very well in Rome.

30
00:06:51.516 --> 00:06:53.428
You'll get spoiled after a while. Frances!

31
00:06:53.518 --> 00:06:54.679
Yes?

32
00:06:54.894 --> 00:06:57.181
I'm having breakfast
on the balcony. Come on out.


33
00:07:00.733 --> 00:07:02.975
- Welcome to Rome.
- Thank you.


34
00:07:03.069 --> 00:07:04.549
Did you have any trouble finding her?

35
00:07:04.612 --> 00:07:06.274
No. I picked her out the first try.

36
00:07:06.364 --> 00:07:08.822
- Have you had any breakfast?
- I can't remember.


37
00:07:08.908 --> 00:07:11.116
Then have some with us. Anna!

38
00:07:11.202 --> 00:07:13.319
Oh, my, oh, my!

39
00:07:14.455 --> 00:07:16.117
Oh, what a beautiful way to live.

40
00:07:16.249 --> 00:07:17.393
I'm glad you like it.

41
00:07:17.417 --> 00:07:18.894
When Anita leaves,
I was going to suggest...


42
00:07:18.918 --> 00:07:22.161
- I've already told her.
- Anna. This is Miss Williams.


43
00:07:22.255 --> 00:07:24.087
<i>Buon giorno, signorina.</i>

44
00:07:24.174 --> 00:07:25.460
How do you do?

45
00:07:25.550 --> 00:07:29.134
What would you like?

46
00:07:29.220 --> 00:07:31.837
Oh, anything, thank you.

47
00:07:35.059 --> 00:07:37.551
I don't think I could afford
anything as elegant as this,


48
00:07:37.645 --> 00:07:38.726
or even half of it.

49
00:07:38.813 --> 00:07:41.647
I promise you can. You're paid
at the agency in dollars.


50
00:07:41.733 --> 00:07:43.770
The rate of exchange is in your favor.

51
00:07:44.485 --> 00:07:45.976
- Are you with the agency too?
- No.


52
00:07:46.070 --> 00:07:48.528
I'm John Frederick Shadwell's secretary.

53
00:07:49.032 --> 00:07:50.614
The man who wrote <i>Winter Harvest?</i>

54
00:07:50.700 --> 00:07:51.986
- Mm-hmm.
- No less.


55
00:07:52.076 --> 00:07:54.568
Mm. He's a great writer, isn't he?

56
00:07:54.662 --> 00:07:55.778
He's a great man.

57
00:07:56.581 --> 00:07:58.197
I thought he was dead.

58
00:07:58.833 --> 00:07:59.949
Most people do,

59
00:08:00.043 --> 00:08:01.803
that's because he hasn't been
back to America


60
00:08:01.836 --> 00:08:03.077
since his early 20s.

61
00:08:03.171 --> 00:08:05.629
Frances has been with him for 15 years.

62
00:08:05.715 --> 00:08:08.708
Gosh. Oh, when do I meet my boss?

63
00:08:08.843 --> 00:08:11.176
After breakfast. We'll all
drive to work together.


64
00:08:11.262 --> 00:08:12.719
You'll meet him in plenty of time.

65
00:08:12.805 --> 00:08:14.467
There's nothing rushed in Rome.

66
00:08:14.766 --> 00:08:17.930
Oh, I'm going to like Rome,
at any rate of exchange.


67
00:08:23.733 --> 00:08:24.894
What's that?

68
00:08:24.984 --> 00:08:26.544
That's the Fountain of Trevi.

69
00:08:26.611 --> 00:08:28.068
Do you want to see it?

70
00:08:43.294 --> 00:08:44.705
If you throw a coin into the pool,

71
00:08:44.837 --> 00:08:46.157
you're supposed to get your wish.

72
00:08:46.339 --> 00:08:48.626
Only the wish must always be
the same thing.


73
00:08:48.716 --> 00:08:50.628
That you'll return again to Rome.

74
00:08:50.843 --> 00:08:52.755
I've tossed a coin
into the fountain every April


75
00:08:52.887 --> 00:08:54.719
for the last... 15 years.

76
00:08:54.806 --> 00:08:57.890
It's my spring ritual.
It's time to throw one in again.


77
00:09:00.144 --> 00:09:02.261
- Don't you want to wish?
- Oh, yes.


78
00:09:05.858 --> 00:09:08.350
Keep me in Rome at least a year,
Mr. Fountain.


79
00:09:08.444 --> 00:09:09.480
No! No, no.

80
00:09:09.570 --> 00:09:11.812
You have to turn around.
Throw it over your shoulder.


81
00:09:11.906 --> 00:09:14.068
Oh.

82
00:09:14.158 --> 00:09:16.992
Bring me... another year of contentment,

83
00:09:17.078 --> 00:09:20.116
whatever gods are listening.
A penny's worth of hope.


84
00:09:21.916 --> 00:09:23.498
Aren't you going to wish?

85
00:09:24.335 --> 00:09:27.203
No. I don't want
to come back to Rome.

86
00:09:27.297 --> 00:09:29.038
Anita's going home to be married.

87
00:09:29.257 --> 00:09:31.715
Oh, then I don't blame you.
Don't tempt fate.


88
00:09:55.158 --> 00:09:57.571
- Good morning, Eleanor.
- Good morning, Anita.


89
00:09:58.411 --> 00:09:59.572
This is my desk.

90
00:09:59.662 --> 00:10:01.699
You'll share it with me
for the time being.


91
00:10:01.998 --> 00:10:04.160
Oh, when do I meet Mr. Burgoyne?

92
00:10:04.250 --> 00:10:05.366
I'll see if he's in.

93
00:10:05.543 --> 00:10:06.875
<i>Yes?</i>

94
00:10:06.961 --> 00:10:08.122
Good morning, Mr. Burgoyne.

95
00:10:08.212 --> 00:10:09.932
Miss Williams is here.
Shall I bring her in?


96
00:10:09.964 --> 00:10:11.604
<i>Not at all. 
I'll come out.</i>

97
00:10:11.674 --> 00:10:13.336
Boss loves to make a good impression.

98
00:10:13.676 --> 00:10:15.668
Oh, any particular instructions?

99
00:10:15.845 --> 00:10:17.256
No. Just be yourself.

100
00:10:18.598 --> 00:10:22.638
Well, well, well, Miss Williams.
Welcome to U.S.D.A.


101
00:10:22.727 --> 00:10:24.559
I abbreviate the name of the agency.

102
00:10:24.645 --> 00:10:25.852
It's the age of the alphabet.

103
00:10:25.938 --> 00:10:27.520
Oh, I see. Thank you.

104
00:10:27.607 --> 00:10:30.099
We hope you like Rome
and the agency, Miss Williams.


105
00:10:30.234 --> 00:10:32.442
- Thank you. I'm sure I will.
- Good, good, good.


106
00:10:32.570 --> 00:10:33.811
I thought I'd spend the morning

107
00:10:33.905 --> 00:10:35.521
showing Maria how we operate here.

108
00:10:35.615 --> 00:10:38.403
Fine, fine, fine. Oh!

109
00:10:38.785 --> 00:10:41.323
Mrs. Burgoyne is giving
a cocktail party this afternoon.


110
00:10:41.621 --> 00:10:44.455
Anita, if you and Miss Williams
are not otherwise occupied,


111
00:10:44.540 --> 00:10:46.623
Mrs. Burgoyne would like
to meet Miss Williams.


112
00:10:46.834 --> 00:10:48.746
Thank you. I'd love to meet Mrs. Burgoyne.

113
00:10:48.836 --> 00:10:50.122
We'll expect you, then.

114
00:11:26.290 --> 00:11:28.873
<i>- Buon giorno.
- Buon giorno, signorina.</i>


115
00:11:42.598 --> 00:11:44.385
Oh. Good morning.

116
00:11:46.144 --> 00:11:47.601
I didn't think you'd be up.

117
00:11:48.312 --> 00:11:51.350
- I've been up all night.
- I must say, you look it.


118
00:11:51.858 --> 00:11:53.770
Well, you might show
a little more consideration


119
00:11:53.860 --> 00:11:55.977
for a man who's just written 20,000 words.

120
00:11:58.448 --> 00:11:59.905
You've started it.

121
00:12:00.825 --> 00:12:03.442
I got home at midnight
intoxicated with an idea.


122
00:12:04.078 --> 00:12:06.570
I worked myself into a creative hangover.

123
00:12:07.039 --> 00:12:09.201
- Let me fix you some coffee.
- No. No, thanks.


124
00:12:10.084 --> 00:12:12.326
While you type these up,
I'm going to fall into bed.


125
00:12:13.045 --> 00:12:15.128
Well, I'm glad you've
given up writing articles


126
00:12:15.423 --> 00:12:17.289
and started back to work
on a novel, again.


127
00:12:17.550 --> 00:12:20.384
- I was afraid you were afraid.
- What do you mean by that?


128
00:12:20.595 --> 00:12:22.803
Oh, nothing. I was worried
for fear the critics


129
00:12:22.889 --> 00:12:25.006
had intimidated you after that last one.

130
00:12:25.099 --> 00:12:27.682
- I should have known better.
- Of course you should have.


131
00:12:28.144 --> 00:12:29.931
I write for myself, not the critics.

132
00:12:30.855 --> 00:12:32.016
You'll be pleased to know

133
00:12:32.148 --> 00:12:33.889
the old master is back in stride again.

134
00:12:35.943 --> 00:12:39.027
I'm rather anxious to hear
what you think about the start.


135
00:12:40.656 --> 00:12:42.739
Not only do I consider it magnificent,

136
00:12:42.909 --> 00:12:44.992
but I have a sneaking suspicion
it's pretty good.


137
00:12:45.745 --> 00:12:46.952
Get some sleep.

138
00:12:47.246 --> 00:12:48.828
I'll knock on your
door in time for you

139
00:12:48.915 --> 00:12:50.595
to make it to the Burgoyne cocktail party.

140
00:12:50.666 --> 00:12:51.702
Not I.

141
00:12:52.251 --> 00:12:53.992
I have no intention of exposing myself

142
00:12:54.086 --> 00:12:55.622
to that dreary assemblage.

143
00:12:56.339 --> 00:12:58.547
When I get up, I'm gonna stroll
through the gardens of


144
00:12:58.674 --> 00:13:00.836
the Villa Borghese
in solitary contentment.


145
00:13:01.636 --> 00:13:04.219
But I've already accepted
the invitation in your name.


146
00:13:04.388 --> 00:13:06.425
Then jolly well make
an excuse in my name.

147
00:13:07.183 --> 00:13:10.051
Do you know what people say
when I mention I work for you?


148
00:13:10.394 --> 00:13:13.057
Something envious, I presume.

149
00:13:13.147 --> 00:13:15.514
They say, "Oh, 
I thought he was dead."

150
00:13:16.859 --> 00:13:18.020
Do they, indeed?

151
00:13:18.361 --> 00:13:20.273
You can't be as antisocial as you are

152
00:13:20.446 --> 00:13:22.654
and still expect people
to know you're alive.


153
00:13:23.866 --> 00:13:26.028
So they think that I'm dead, do they?

154
00:13:26.118 --> 00:13:27.199
Hmm.

155
00:13:27.578 --> 00:13:29.490
Well, well.

156
00:13:30.456 --> 00:13:31.742
Wake me at 4:00.

157
00:13:32.416 --> 00:13:34.203
I'll make an appearance to prove my public

158
00:13:34.293 --> 00:13:35.579
only half right.

159
00:13:37.171 --> 00:13:38.707
When these come in from Washington,

160
00:13:38.798 --> 00:13:40.585
they have to be translated into Italian.

161
00:13:40.841 --> 00:13:41.877
By me?

162
00:13:42.051 --> 00:13:43.792
Oh, no. We have interpreters here.

163
00:13:44.262 --> 00:13:46.470
Giorgio, would you come in
for a minute, please?


164
00:13:46.847 --> 00:13:48.679
Giorgio handles our translations for us.

165
00:13:48.766 --> 00:13:50.132
Then they're given to Mr. Burgoyne

166
00:13:50.226 --> 00:13:52.309
for clearance with the Italian bureau.

167
00:13:52.395 --> 00:13:54.603
- Good morning, Miss Anita.
- Oh. Good morning.


168
00:13:54.689 --> 00:13:57.807
Maria, this is Giorgio Bianchi.
Giorgio, this is Maria Williams.


169
00:13:57.984 --> 00:13:59.850
She'll be taking my place when I leave.

170
00:14:00.027 --> 00:14:02.485
If I can be of
any help, please call me.

171
00:14:03.406 --> 00:14:05.773
I heard you were returning
to America, Miss Anita.


172
00:14:06.200 --> 00:14:08.658
I shall... We shall miss you.

173
00:14:09.120 --> 00:14:11.203
Oh. Thank you.

174
00:14:12.748 --> 00:14:14.740
Here, would you make
a translation of these


175
00:14:14.875 --> 00:14:17.162
- for Mr. Burgoyne, please?
- Yes, Miss Anita.


176
00:14:22.592 --> 00:14:23.592
Well!

177
00:14:24.719 --> 00:14:28.008
I forgot to tell you.
There's a policy here.


178
00:14:28.389 --> 00:14:31.097
Secretaries are not allowed
to go out with local employees.


179
00:14:31.392 --> 00:14:33.349
Mr. Burgoyne's policy, if you please.

180
00:14:33.894 --> 00:14:35.305
How do you manage it, then?

181
00:14:35.688 --> 00:14:36.929
Giorgio?

182
00:14:37.023 --> 00:14:38.703
We've never exchanged more than two words.

183
00:14:38.733 --> 00:14:41.020
- He's just part of the office.
- Oh.


184
00:14:41.110 --> 00:14:43.898
Does his hand always shake
when he gets near to you?


185
00:14:44.238 --> 00:14:46.855
You're imagining things.
He doesn't even know I exist.


186
00:14:46.949 --> 00:14:49.407
Oh! He doesn't know anyone else exists.

187
00:14:49.493 --> 00:14:52.076
He didn't even notice whether
I was a blonde or a brunette...


188
00:14:52.163 --> 00:14:53.574
Well, you're wrong.

189
00:14:54.915 --> 00:14:56.872
Call him in.

190
00:14:57.877 --> 00:15:00.870
I just want to look at those
beautiful brown eyes again.


191
00:15:00.963 --> 00:15:02.875
- Not brown, they're blue.
- Oh.


192
00:15:02.965 --> 00:15:06.083
I mean... It's a good thing
I'm going home.


193
00:15:06.177 --> 00:15:07.213
With you around here,

194
00:15:07.303 --> 00:15:09.090
I'd be in a puddle
of trouble in no time.

195
00:15:09.180 --> 00:15:10.796
Here, sit down and
open those up for me.

196
00:15:28.074 --> 00:15:31.317
Mr. Shadwell, I don't care
what the critics said.


197
00:15:31.410 --> 00:15:34.494
I want you to know
I just adored your last novel.


198
00:15:34.580 --> 00:15:36.947
Unfortunately,
there were not enough of you.


199
00:15:37.041 --> 00:15:39.328
Tell me, do you get
your best ideas at night?


200
00:15:39.418 --> 00:15:40.579
I always do.

201
00:15:40.670 --> 00:15:43.708
Invariably, but hardly
material to write about.


202
00:15:43.798 --> 00:15:47.462
My husband declares that I
was simply born to be a writer.


203
00:15:47.551 --> 00:15:51.135
He says if anyone just took
a pencil and followed me around,


204
00:15:51.305 --> 00:15:52.512
they'd have a novel.

205
00:15:52.598 --> 00:15:53.679
My dear lady,

206
00:15:53.891 --> 00:15:56.349
I should be delighted
to get behind you with a pencil.


207
00:15:56.560 --> 00:15:57.596
Excuse me.

208
00:16:05.569 --> 00:16:07.214
We've learned from long experience

209
00:16:07.238 --> 00:16:09.230
this is the best
way to pass the time.

210
00:16:09.699 --> 00:16:12.942
So, this is Rome,
where the pigeons eat caviar.


211
00:16:13.035 --> 00:16:14.822
And the secretaries eat alone.

212
00:16:15.746 --> 00:16:19.330
Look, did you ever see
such a handsome car?


213
00:16:19.583 --> 00:16:20.994
You ever see such a handsome man?

214
00:16:21.085 --> 00:16:24.419
- It's Prince di Cessi.
- A prince? Do you know him?


215
00:16:24.505 --> 00:16:27.339
He's a friend of Mr. Shadwell's.
Part of the Roman scene.


216
00:16:27.425 --> 00:16:29.132
Um, eligible?

217
00:16:29.802 --> 00:16:31.293
Dino is handsome, wealthy,

218
00:16:31.387 --> 00:16:33.424
and has one of
the oldest titles in Europe.


219
00:16:33.514 --> 00:16:35.130
As long as he has the first two,

220
00:16:35.224 --> 00:16:36.664
you won't catch him getting married.

221
00:16:36.767 --> 00:16:38.508
Oh, what a shame.

222
00:16:39.103 --> 00:16:40.344
Oh!

223
00:16:40.438 --> 00:16:41.679
What's the matter?

224
00:16:41.772 --> 00:16:43.729
Oh, I knocked my purse off the railing.

225
00:16:43.816 --> 00:16:45.227
I'll ask Dino to get it for you.

226
00:16:45.359 --> 00:16:48.352
Oh, no. Please don't.
He'll think I did it on purpose.


227
00:16:48.446 --> 00:16:50.813
- He won't mind. Dino?
- Yes?


228
00:16:50.906 --> 00:16:52.706
We dropped a purse
from the balcony.


229
00:16:52.742 --> 00:16:54.278
Would you mind bringing it up?

230
00:16:54.368 --> 00:16:56.701
With the greatest of pleasure,
Miss Frances.


231
00:16:59.582 --> 00:17:01.744
You sure you didn't
knock it off on purpose?


232
00:17:02.168 --> 00:17:05.206
Oh, no, believe me, I didn't.
I'm not that quick-witted.


233
00:17:05.296 --> 00:17:07.629
Well, just in case it was instinct,

234
00:17:07.715 --> 00:17:09.515
perhaps we'd better warn
our friend about Dino


235
00:17:09.592 --> 00:17:10.878
before she meets him.

236
00:17:10.968 --> 00:17:13.210
He's known as "the predatory prince."

237
00:17:13.304 --> 00:17:15.512
And girls who are seen
in his company more than once


238
00:17:15.598 --> 00:17:17.134
are known as Venice Girls.

239
00:17:17.224 --> 00:17:18.224
Why?

240
00:17:18.517 --> 00:17:21.430
The time comes when he asks you
to fly to Venice with him.


241
00:17:21.520 --> 00:17:22.977
Once you're known as a Venice Girl,

242
00:17:23.063 --> 00:17:24.304
you might as well go home.

243
00:17:27.902 --> 00:17:29.313
I hope nothing was broken.

244
00:17:29.403 --> 00:17:31.019
Thank you. It belongs to my friend.

245
00:17:31.113 --> 00:17:33.651
Maria, this is Prince di Cessi.
This is Miss Williams.


246
00:17:33.741 --> 00:17:35.357
- How do you do?
- How do you do?


247
00:17:35.451 --> 00:17:37.864
Fresh from the States.
Of course, you know Anita.


248
00:17:37.953 --> 00:17:40.115
Oh, yes. We met when
I first came to Rome.

249
00:17:40.206 --> 00:17:42.619
Yes, yes. I remember it with sadness.

250
00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:44.536
People said bad things about me,

251
00:17:44.794 --> 00:17:46.706
and you would not permit me
to show you Rome.


252
00:17:47.880 --> 00:17:50.748
Have they been telling you
disgraceful things about me too?


253
00:17:50.841 --> 00:17:53.049
- Oh, no.
- That's too bad.


254
00:17:53.427 --> 00:17:55.419
If only half the things
said about me were true,


255
00:17:55.513 --> 00:17:57.049
I'd be a happy man.

256
00:17:57.181 --> 00:17:59.468
- I suspect half of them are.
- You see?


257
00:17:59.558 --> 00:18:01.299
There is a conspiracy against me in Rome.

258
00:18:01.393 --> 00:18:02.600
You must excuse me.

259
00:18:02.686 --> 00:18:05.394
I haven't spoken to my host yet.
I'll be back.


260
00:18:07.942 --> 00:18:09.524
He's nice.

261
00:18:09.985 --> 00:18:12.318
Oh, I don't believe
he's the wolf you say.

262
00:18:12.863 --> 00:18:15.196
Why, he looks as
innocent as a little boy.

263
00:18:15.282 --> 00:18:16.773
Oh, that he does.

264
00:18:16.867 --> 00:18:19.450
But don't try taking him
on your lap to mother him.


265
00:18:19.870 --> 00:18:22.237
You'll find yourself suddenly
screaming for the police.


266
00:18:28.170 --> 00:18:31.254
Well, so much for your
first cocktail party in Rome.


267
00:18:31.340 --> 00:18:33.832
- Shall we walk home or ride?
- Let's walk.


268
00:18:46.730 --> 00:18:48.346
Do you know something strange?

269
00:18:48.607 --> 00:18:50.223
Except for that handsome prince,

270
00:18:50.317 --> 00:18:53.060
not one attractive man
came near us at the party.


271
00:18:53.946 --> 00:18:56.233
Well, I guess now is
as good a time as any

272
00:18:56.323 --> 00:18:57.609
to disillusion you.

273
00:18:57.950 --> 00:19:00.693
If you're romantic,
Rome is not the city for you.


274
00:19:00.786 --> 00:19:01.822
Why not?

275
00:19:02.329 --> 00:19:03.945
Well, wealthy Italians

276
00:19:04.039 --> 00:19:06.201
don't waste their time on secretaries,

277
00:19:06.292 --> 00:19:08.784
and the Italians that work
at the agency are too poor.


278
00:19:09.044 --> 00:19:12.333
Oh. No wonder you're
going home to be married.


279
00:19:12.715 --> 00:19:14.081
I'm not even engaged.

280
00:19:14.174 --> 00:19:16.791
I just gave that as an excuse
at the agency for leaving.


281
00:19:17.177 --> 00:19:19.043
But at least I'm
going back to a country

282
00:19:19.138 --> 00:19:21.130
where I hope some
nice guy will ask me.

283
00:19:21.765 --> 00:19:24.098
That's why I didn't throw a coin
in the Fountain of Trevi.


284
00:19:24.560 --> 00:19:26.301
Oh, dear. It looks as though I've wasted

285
00:19:26.395 --> 00:19:28.307
a perfectly good penny.

286
00:19:41.535 --> 00:19:42.696
Well, which way?

287
00:19:42.786 --> 00:19:45.028
This way looks sort of
interesting. You want to try it?


288
00:19:45.122 --> 00:19:46.988
It doesn't look very respectable.

289
00:19:47.082 --> 00:19:48.539
Good. Let's have a look.

290
00:20:11.774 --> 00:20:14.562
- Anita, somebody pinched me.
- Don't look back.


291
00:20:14.652 --> 00:20:15.984
It's considered an encouragement.

292
00:20:16.070 --> 00:20:17.311
Just pretend you didn't notice.

293
00:20:17.404 --> 00:20:19.284
Are you kidding?
I'll kick him in his antipasto.


294
00:20:19.323 --> 00:20:20.404
Oh, let's go.

295
00:20:37.967 --> 00:20:40.960
- Giorgio!
- Oh. Miss Anita.


296
00:20:42.805 --> 00:20:45.263
We've been waiting for you.
I thought you said 7:00.


297
00:20:45.349 --> 00:20:46.760
What detained you?

298
00:20:54.108 --> 00:20:55.974
I've been showing Maria the city,

299
00:20:56.110 --> 00:20:57.191
and he followed us.

300
00:20:57.277 --> 00:21:00.111
You shouldn't be in this section
unescorted, Miss Anita.


301
00:21:00.197 --> 00:21:02.564
Things can happen that
American girls don't understand.


302
00:21:02.658 --> 00:21:03.944
We understand, all right.

303
00:21:04.034 --> 00:21:06.401
A pinch is a
pinch in any man's language.

304
00:21:06.704 --> 00:21:09.367
As long as you are here
and I am here, Miss Anita,


305
00:21:09.540 --> 00:21:11.577
would you allow me
to show you my Rome?

306
00:21:11.750 --> 00:21:14.458
- We'd love to.
- Well, sure.


307
00:21:14.545 --> 00:21:17.037
<i>Bene</i>.

308
00:21:21.218 --> 00:21:22.504
It's strange.

309
00:21:22.886 --> 00:21:25.424
We have seen each other
every day for two years,


310
00:21:25.848 --> 00:21:27.259
and yet this is the first time

311
00:21:27.349 --> 00:21:28.931
I have ever really talked to you.

312
00:21:29.268 --> 00:21:31.134
I always thought
you didn't like Americans.


313
00:21:31.270 --> 00:21:33.557
Oh, no. I thought you
didn't like Italians.


314
00:21:33.647 --> 00:21:35.309
Isn't that silly?

315
00:21:35.607 --> 00:21:36.893
What's that monastery?

316
00:21:37.693 --> 00:21:39.480
Oh no, it's not a monastery.

317
00:21:39.570 --> 00:21:40.902
It's a <i>palazzo.</i>

318
00:21:40.988 --> 00:21:41.988
A <i>palazzo?</i>

319
00:21:41.989 --> 00:21:43.696
- Oh, that's a palace, isn't it?
- Mm-hmm.


320
00:21:43.782 --> 00:21:44.818
Who owns it?

321
00:21:44.908 --> 00:21:47.321
It's the home of the prince,
Dino di Cessi.


322
00:21:48.412 --> 00:21:52.577
Oh. Well, you two just drink your wine.

323
00:21:52.708 --> 00:21:54.700
I'm gonna sit here
and look at the <i>palazzo.</i>


324
00:21:56.003 --> 00:21:58.211
- Does he live there all alone?
- Oh, no.


325
00:21:59.548 --> 00:22:00.584
Oh.

326
00:22:00.674 --> 00:22:03.041
He lives with his mother, the <i>principessa.</i>

327
00:22:03.135 --> 00:22:04.922
Oh, how sweet.

328
00:22:05.679 --> 00:22:08.342
But he must get lonely.
What does he do for amusement?


329
00:22:08.432 --> 00:22:10.970
Oh, he has diversions.
He plays the piccolo.


330
00:22:11.977 --> 00:22:14.344
- He plays what?
- The piccolo.


331
00:22:14.938 --> 00:22:16.725
He's an excellent piccolo player.

332
00:22:17.232 --> 00:22:19.224
My cousin is his teacher.

333
00:22:19.401 --> 00:22:20.401
Well, that does it.

334
00:22:20.527 --> 00:22:22.338
I think I'll have some wine
with you after all.


335
00:22:22.362 --> 00:22:26.606
Good! This is the wine
that we drink on our <i>festa.</i>


336
00:22:27.785 --> 00:22:29.785
Have you ever been to
an Italian <i>festa,</i> Miss Anita?


337
00:22:29.870 --> 00:22:31.156
No, I don't think so.

338
00:22:31.371 --> 00:22:33.328
We are having one at our farm, tomorrow,

339
00:22:33.707 --> 00:22:35.494
to celebrate my sister's engagement.

340
00:22:36.001 --> 00:22:38.960
You shouldn't go back to America
without seeing an Italian <i>festa.</i>


341
00:22:39.505 --> 00:22:41.588
Uh... If you would like
to come too, Miss Williams...


342
00:22:41.673 --> 00:22:44.040
No, thank you. I have to stay
and write some letters.


343
00:22:44.218 --> 00:22:46.084
All my family expect a report from me,

344
00:22:46.178 --> 00:22:49.091
and I can't disappoint them.
Why don't you go, Anita?


345
00:22:49.598 --> 00:22:51.965
Well, I'd love to,
but I don't think I could.


346
00:22:52.059 --> 00:22:54.301
I know. It's against the agency rules.

347
00:22:54.394 --> 00:22:56.260
Oh, but it's only this once.

348
00:22:56.438 --> 00:22:59.055
You're not gonna let some silly
old rule stand in your way.


349
00:22:59.149 --> 00:23:01.266
Well, it isn't that. 
I have packing to do.

350
00:23:01.527 --> 00:23:02.813
My cousin has a truck.

351
00:23:02.903 --> 00:23:05.441
He is driving in to pick up
our relatives in Rome.


352
00:23:05.823 --> 00:23:08.611
We could ride in the truck,
if you didn't mind.


353
00:23:09.618 --> 00:23:10.950
Oh, all right, Giorgio.

354
00:23:11.036 --> 00:23:13.870
I'll be darned if I'll spend
my last weekend in Rome alone.


355
00:23:38.147 --> 00:23:40.480
Giorgio, you're not giving it wine?

356
00:23:40.566 --> 00:23:42.478
Oh, no, no, Miss Anita. Water.

357
00:23:42.860 --> 00:23:44.146
I am sorry to be late,

358
00:23:44.236 --> 00:23:45.943
but unfortunately, a wheel came off.

359
00:23:46.321 --> 00:23:48.404
<i>Andiamo</i>.

360
00:23:50.617 --> 00:23:53.234
- This is my cousin, Enrico.
- How do you do?


361
00:23:58.417 --> 00:24:00.704
What?

362
00:24:00.794 --> 00:24:02.394
- These are all your cousins?
- Oh, yeah.


363
00:24:02.462 --> 00:24:05.500
Cousins, brothers, nieces.
I will introduce you later.


364
00:24:06.884 --> 00:24:08.375
<i>Andiamo!</i>

365
00:24:32.284 --> 00:24:34.822
My cousin has no brakes, nor horn.

366
00:24:34.912 --> 00:24:36.369
Did we frighten you?

367
00:24:36.955 --> 00:24:39.618
Oh, no. I'm all right, I think.

368
00:24:40.667 --> 00:24:42.329
When the driver gives the signal,

369
00:24:42.419 --> 00:24:44.456
we must all toot like horns.

370
00:24:45.005 --> 00:24:46.858
But, Giorgio, don't you think
it's a little dangerous


371
00:24:46.882 --> 00:24:48.919
to drive without brakes
and without a horn?


372
00:24:49.009 --> 00:24:50.045
Oh, no.

373
00:24:50.135 --> 00:24:52.548
We hang a St. Christopher medal
on the windshield.


374
00:24:52.638 --> 00:24:54.129
Nothing can happen to us.

375
00:25:05.442 --> 00:25:07.434
Did you ever ride in a truck before?

376
00:25:07.527 --> 00:25:09.109
No, I haven't.

377
00:25:09.696 --> 00:25:11.153
Whoa!

378
00:25:25.921 --> 00:25:28.709
- Giorgio, what happened?
- Oh, nothing.


379
00:25:29.174 --> 00:25:32.338
Nothing? It's an accident.

380
00:25:54.658 --> 00:25:56.775
Isn't that Anita, your secretary,

381
00:25:56.868 --> 00:25:58.029
in that truck?

382
00:25:58.120 --> 00:26:00.453
And with the interpreter from the office.

383
00:26:27.899 --> 00:26:31.358
<i>Pronto</i>. 
Why, yes, she is. 
Just a moment.

384
00:26:31.528 --> 00:26:32.689
It's for you, Maria.

385
00:26:32.904 --> 00:26:34.861
I don't know anyone in Rome, yet.

386
00:26:36.408 --> 00:26:38.946
Hello? Yes.

387
00:26:40.454 --> 00:26:42.821
Yes. It's that Prince di Cessi.

388
00:26:42.956 --> 00:26:45.198
Dino? How did he ever find this number?

389
00:26:45.751 --> 00:26:47.834
Well, how did you ever find the number?

390
00:26:48.045 --> 00:26:49.707
Oh, one has ways.

391
00:26:50.339 --> 00:26:53.173
I was planning on flying
my plane to Venice this morning.


392
00:26:53.592 --> 00:26:54.753
Have you been to Venice?

393
00:26:55.761 --> 00:26:57.969
He wants to know
if I'll fly with him to Venice.


394
00:26:58.055 --> 00:26:59.171
What'll I say?

395
00:26:59.389 --> 00:27:02.223
- Say no.
- Yes, I'd love to,


396
00:27:02.309 --> 00:27:04.266
but I'm sorry. I can't.

397
00:27:06.355 --> 00:27:07.471
Y... Um...

398
00:27:08.148 --> 00:27:10.108
He says we could fly there
and be back by tonight.


399
00:27:10.233 --> 00:27:11.313
That's what he always says,

400
00:27:11.360 --> 00:27:13.200
and then he'll have trouble
with his propeller,


401
00:27:13.278 --> 00:27:15.038
and you'll have trouble
with your reputation.


402
00:27:15.113 --> 00:27:19.153
- Thank him kindly, but hang up.
- Yes, I'd love to, but...


403
00:27:20.077 --> 00:27:22.865
It's very kind of you,
but I'm sorry. I can't.


404
00:27:22.954 --> 00:27:25.162
- Say yes.
- Yes?


405
00:27:25.374 --> 00:27:27.741
- Yes.
- Just a moment. Why?


406
00:27:27.834 --> 00:27:29.200
You want to see Venice.

407
00:27:29.294 --> 00:27:31.331
But tell him you have
to be back by tonight.


408
00:27:31.421 --> 00:27:33.301
- But you just said...
- Never mind what I said.


409
00:27:33.340 --> 00:27:34.547
Tell him you'll go.

410
00:27:37.844 --> 00:27:38.844
You will?

411
00:27:39.221 --> 00:27:41.338
Oh, I promise you
I will get you back tonight.


412
00:27:42.099 --> 00:27:45.012
And I will do everything I can
to see that you enjoy your trip.


413
00:27:46.061 --> 00:27:48.929
Can you be ready
in a half hour? Good.

414
00:27:49.439 --> 00:27:50.600
I shall be there.

415
00:28:10.085 --> 00:28:11.085
You are ready!

416
00:28:11.086 --> 00:28:12.702
This is the first time in my life

417
00:28:12.796 --> 00:28:15.038
I have not been kept waiting.
It's a good omen.


418
00:28:15.132 --> 00:28:16.526
- Good morning, Miss Frances.
- Good morning.


419
00:28:16.550 --> 00:28:17.944
- It's very nice to see you.
- Thank you.


420
00:28:17.968 --> 00:28:19.362
At the prospect of going to Venice,

421
00:28:19.386 --> 00:28:20.655
I could be ready in five minutes.

422
00:28:20.679 --> 00:28:21.965
Oh, I can promise you

423
00:28:22.055 --> 00:28:24.047
it will be a trip
that you shall long remember.


424
00:28:24.141 --> 00:28:25.677
So let us not waste any time.

425
00:28:25.767 --> 00:28:28.054
Oh, you don't mind giving
Miss Frances a lift, do you?


426
00:28:28.145 --> 00:28:30.603
Not at all. Where shall
I drop you, Miss Frances?


427
00:28:30.689 --> 00:28:31.805
Venice.

428
00:28:33.483 --> 00:28:34.483
Venice?

429
00:28:34.568 --> 00:28:36.480
Well, if it's not too much trouble.

430
00:28:36.570 --> 00:28:38.106
Yes, you see, Miss Frances

431
00:28:38.196 --> 00:28:39.858
was going to Venice herself this weekend,

432
00:28:39.948 --> 00:28:42.782
and I thought it might be fun
if she came along with us.


433
00:28:43.910 --> 00:28:45.993
- Oh.
- You don't mind, do you?


434
00:28:46.079 --> 00:28:47.866
Oh, not at all. Not at all.

435
00:28:48.290 --> 00:28:51.124
But, well, my plane
is not a large one

436
00:28:51.209 --> 00:28:53.371
and, well, I'm afraid

437
00:28:53.462 --> 00:28:55.294
it would be most uncomfortable,
Miss Frances.


438
00:28:55.380 --> 00:28:58.123
Well, I suppose I had better
take the train after all.


439
00:28:58.300 --> 00:28:59.836
Oh, that is too bad.

440
00:29:00.051 --> 00:29:02.634
Well, I certainly couldn't
let you make that trip alone.


441
00:29:02.846 --> 00:29:04.963
So I'll go on the train with you,

442
00:29:05.056 --> 00:29:07.548
and I can meet you in Venice.
Is that all right?


443
00:30:09.412 --> 00:30:11.244
- Mama!
<i>- Caro!</i>


444
00:30:14.084 --> 00:30:16.667
This is my mother, Anita.
I told her all about you.


445
00:30:16.753 --> 00:30:18.710
<i>Buon giorno, signora. Come sta?</i>

446
00:30:24.427 --> 00:30:26.760
She talks too fast. 
What'd she say?

447
00:30:26.846 --> 00:30:28.929
- She said you're very pretty.
<i>- Grazie.</i>


448
00:30:29.015 --> 00:30:31.177
- This is my father.
<i>- Come sta, signore?</i>


449
00:30:31.309 --> 00:30:33.926
<i>Bravo, Giorgio.</i>

450
00:30:35.689 --> 00:30:37.681
<i>Quando il matrimonio, eh?</i>

451
00:30:38.233 --> 00:30:40.099
- What did he say?
- Oh, nothing.


452
00:30:40.193 --> 00:30:42.651
My father means well,
but he misunderstands.


453
00:30:43.488 --> 00:30:44.979
This is my sister, Angela.

454
00:30:45.574 --> 00:30:47.406
We are celebrating her engagement today.

455
00:30:47.492 --> 00:30:49.154
Oh, <i>ciao,</i> Angela.

456
00:31:00.714 --> 00:31:03.798
Dinner is ready!

457
00:31:37.292 --> 00:31:41.002
Bravo!

458
00:32:26.216 --> 00:32:27.798
Off there is Rome.

459
00:32:30.637 --> 00:32:32.754
I used to sit
here when I was small

460
00:32:33.264 --> 00:32:35.426
and dream someday
of going away to the city.


461
00:32:36.434 --> 00:32:38.266
When I first came
to Rome as a boy,

462
00:32:38.353 --> 00:32:40.390
I threw a coin
in the Fountain of Trevi.

463
00:32:40.980 --> 00:32:42.767
I wanted to return and become a lawyer.

464
00:32:43.692 --> 00:32:46.275
- What do you think?
- You got your wish.


465
00:32:47.404 --> 00:32:48.404
No.

466
00:32:48.530 --> 00:32:51.113
There is something more
to the dream than I asked for.


467
00:32:51.700 --> 00:32:54.067
Well, you'll be a lawyer.

468
00:32:54.160 --> 00:32:55.947
You'll be a very
good one, too, I know.

469
00:32:56.037 --> 00:32:57.448
I've always liked lawyers.

470
00:32:58.123 --> 00:32:59.739
That's not what I meant.

471
00:33:03.002 --> 00:33:05.836
The man you are going back
to America to marry,


472
00:33:06.589 --> 00:33:08.251
is he, by any chance, a lawyer?

473
00:33:10.009 --> 00:33:12.547
Well, the truth of the matter is...

474
00:33:14.222 --> 00:33:17.056
Actually, it embarrasses me
to have to tell you, Giorgio,


475
00:33:17.183 --> 00:33:19.516
but I guess I
do owe you an explanation.

476
00:33:19.602 --> 00:33:21.559
No, you owe me nothing, Miss Anita.

477
00:33:21.688 --> 00:33:23.600
I have no right to cross-examine you.

478
00:33:23.690 --> 00:33:25.226
It was not judicial.

479
00:33:25.567 --> 00:33:27.399
- But I...
- No, no. Please.


480
00:33:30.405 --> 00:33:31.737
What's in the valley below?

481
00:33:34.325 --> 00:33:37.113
The bottom of the hill.

482
00:33:37.287 --> 00:33:39.495
But there is also
a pool and a stream.

483
00:33:40.039 --> 00:33:42.406
- Very shady and beautiful.
- Hmm.


484
00:33:42.917 --> 00:33:45.955
I've always liked streams.
Could we go down?


485
00:33:46.171 --> 00:33:49.460
But of course. Uh... Shall we
take my cousin's truck?


486
00:33:50.133 --> 00:33:52.671
- I'll honk when you signal.
- All right.


487
00:34:06.483 --> 00:34:07.763
You wouldn't believe it, I know,

488
00:34:07.817 --> 00:34:10.150
but this car and
I are the same age.

489
00:34:10.278 --> 00:34:11.735
Hmm. I believe it.

490
00:34:13.281 --> 00:34:14.362
Okay.

491
00:34:19.913 --> 00:34:22.496
- Oh! Are you hurt?
- Put the car in gear!


492
00:34:22.832 --> 00:34:25.119
- Giorgio!
- Jump, Anita! Jump out!


493
00:34:26.586 --> 00:34:29.374
Giorgio! Giorgio!

494
00:34:34.803 --> 00:34:36.886
Giorgio!

495
00:34:36.971 --> 00:34:38.758
Anita, put it in gear!

496
00:34:40.475 --> 00:34:41.475
Anita!

497
00:34:52.904 --> 00:34:55.271
Anita! Anita, jump!

498
00:34:55.365 --> 00:34:56.731
- Jump out!
- I can't!


499
00:35:02.914 --> 00:35:05.657
Anita! Anita!

500
00:35:05.750 --> 00:35:07.707
- Giorgio!
- Anita, did you get hurt?


501
00:35:07.961 --> 00:35:10.123
No. No.

502
00:35:10.380 --> 00:35:14.215
No, I'm all right. I... I
just couldn't get it into gear.


503
00:35:14.300 --> 00:35:16.257
You could have been killed, Anita.

504
00:35:19.222 --> 00:35:20.222
No.

505
00:35:22.267 --> 00:35:25.180
Anita. Anita.

506
00:35:27.730 --> 00:35:29.141
I love you so much.

507
00:35:29.482 --> 00:35:31.474
I want to tell
you that I love you.

508
00:35:43.329 --> 00:35:44.615
What are they shouting?

509
00:35:45.206 --> 00:35:47.573
They want to know
if we are all right.

510
00:35:48.835 --> 00:35:52.124
You tell them
we're quite all right...


511
00:35:53.131 --> 00:35:54.247
for the moment.

512
00:38:47.638 --> 00:38:48.674
Look.

513
00:39:08.034 --> 00:39:09.034
Look.

514
00:39:18.002 --> 00:39:19.959
It's been a wonderful day, Dino.
It really has.


515
00:39:20.046 --> 00:39:21.378
I'm glad that you enjoyed it.

516
00:39:21.464 --> 00:39:24.832
I'm sorry I was 15 years late
in accepting your invitation.


517
00:39:24.967 --> 00:39:27.459
Perhaps we can do it again,
in another 15 years.


518
00:39:27.553 --> 00:39:28.794
<i>Scusi, signor.</i>

519
00:39:28.888 --> 00:39:30.629
Oh, <i>grazie.</i>

520
00:39:31.140 --> 00:39:32.597
Will you excuse me a second?

521
00:39:35.061 --> 00:39:36.677
Something tells me he's angry.

522
00:39:37.772 --> 00:39:39.855
I don't blame him. 
It was a mean trick.

523
00:39:40.566 --> 00:39:42.057
Pity is, I really like him,

524
00:39:42.151 --> 00:39:44.004
and now he'll probably
never want to see me again.


525
00:39:44.028 --> 00:39:45.468
I really should have stayed at home.

526
00:39:46.989 --> 00:39:49.697
Nonsense. We agreed this
was my chance to see Venice.


527
00:39:50.827 --> 00:39:52.864
Why don't I take the train back tonight,

528
00:39:53.037 --> 00:39:54.403
and you can stay on an extra day?

529
00:39:54.497 --> 00:39:57.331
- If you want to. Do you want to?
- Well...


530
00:40:02.004 --> 00:40:03.165
It was the airport.

531
00:40:03.297 --> 00:40:05.254
My plane is ready to
take off at any time.

532
00:40:05.758 --> 00:40:07.624
I was just trying to convince Maria

533
00:40:07.718 --> 00:40:09.459
that she ought to stay over another day.

534
00:40:09.929 --> 00:40:11.841
Well, of course,
if you two wish to remain,


535
00:40:12.098 --> 00:40:14.135
but I really have
to get back tonight, you see.


536
00:40:14.433 --> 00:40:15.433
It is regrettable,

537
00:40:15.518 --> 00:40:17.638
but I have a meeting with
some of my tenants tomorrow.


538
00:40:17.687 --> 00:40:19.895
Oh, well that settles it,
if both of you are leaving,


539
00:40:19.981 --> 00:40:22.439
there's no point in
my staying on here alone.


540
00:40:23.526 --> 00:40:24.526
Alone?

541
00:40:24.986 --> 00:40:26.318
Under the circumstances,

542
00:40:26.404 --> 00:40:28.084
I'm sure that I can make
some arrangements.


543
00:40:28.156 --> 00:40:30.523
Oh, no. I don't want you
to disappoint your tenants.


544
00:40:53.723 --> 00:40:55.339
Well, where were you?

545
00:40:57.435 --> 00:40:59.017
I was just wondering how it would feel

546
00:40:59.103 --> 00:41:01.265
to ride to work
on the handlebars of a bicycle.


547
00:41:01.522 --> 00:41:02.558
Why?

548
00:41:06.110 --> 00:41:07.271
Yes, Mr. Burgoyne?

549
00:41:07.445 --> 00:41:08.589
<i>Maria, will you come</i>

550
00:41:08.613 --> 00:41:09.899
<i>into the office at once, please?</i>

551
00:41:09.989 --> 00:41:10.989
Yes, sir.

552
00:41:12.074 --> 00:41:13.656
He must have slept here.

553
00:41:20.208 --> 00:41:21.619
Yes, Mr. Burgoyne?

554
00:41:22.001 --> 00:41:23.617
I want to talk to you, Maria.

555
00:41:24.462 --> 00:41:25.462
Uh...

556
00:41:25.546 --> 00:41:28.209
We feel, here, at the agency,
that Americans abroad


557
00:41:28.299 --> 00:41:30.256
have a responsibility to their country.

558
00:41:30.635 --> 00:41:32.797
They should always conduct
themselves with dignity.


559
00:41:33.387 --> 00:41:35.595
If you mean about my going
to Venice, Mr. Burgoyne,


560
00:41:35.681 --> 00:41:36.681
I assure you...

561
00:41:36.766 --> 00:41:38.553
I was referring to Anita, 
Miss Williams.

562
00:41:39.227 --> 00:41:40.227
Oh.

563
00:41:40.603 --> 00:41:43.516
As you know, it is the policy
of our agency


564
00:41:43.606 --> 00:41:46.895
that our secretaries do not
go out with the local employees.


565
00:41:47.235 --> 00:41:48.235
Yes, sir.

566
00:41:48.569 --> 00:41:51.232
Anita has been violating
that rule, hasn't she?


567
00:41:52.490 --> 00:41:54.948
Why, whatever makes you
think that, Mr. Burgoyne?


568
00:41:55.368 --> 00:41:57.360
I saw her going out
of the city with Giorgio.


569
00:41:58.579 --> 00:41:59.579
Oh.

570
00:42:00.790 --> 00:42:03.908
Well, there was some sort
of festival in the country and...


571
00:42:04.001 --> 00:42:05.287
She spent the weekend with him?

572
00:42:06.254 --> 00:42:08.211
But she's going back to America
to be married.


573
00:42:08.631 --> 00:42:11.749
Oh, no, she isn't. She only used that
as an excuse...


574
00:42:12.385 --> 00:42:13.385
You...

575
00:42:13.719 --> 00:42:16.382
You mean that the situation is
such that it became necessary


576
00:42:16.472 --> 00:42:18.179
for her to create this deception?

577
00:42:19.350 --> 00:42:22.070
Well, of course, you don't have to
answer that, if you prefer not to.


578
00:42:22.353 --> 00:42:24.720
I'd gladly answer it, Mr. Burgoyne.

579
00:42:25.398 --> 00:42:27.890
Anita has done nothing wrong,
I promise you.


580
00:42:29.068 --> 00:42:30.775
Why don't you ask her yourself?

581
00:42:31.362 --> 00:42:32.443
I will.

582
00:42:33.239 --> 00:42:35.276
Thank you for your reassurance,
Miss Williams.


583
00:42:36.450 --> 00:42:38.783
It's only that my interest
in my girls here


584
00:42:38.869 --> 00:42:40.861
transcends official obligation.

585
00:42:41.205 --> 00:42:43.288
- Is that all, sir?
- Yes, thank you.


586
00:42:51.716 --> 00:42:52.752
Yes.

587
00:42:53.926 --> 00:42:54.926
Yes, but you see,

588
00:42:55.052 --> 00:42:57.294
we haven't had any official
notification of it yet.


589
00:42:58.472 --> 00:43:03.263
Yes, sir. Yes. All right.

590
00:43:04.103 --> 00:43:05.310
<i>Via Condore.</i>

591
00:43:08.107 --> 00:43:09.473
Fifty-one, yes.

592
00:43:23.247 --> 00:43:24.909
I can't understand why she said

593
00:43:24.999 --> 00:43:26.615
she was going home to get married.

594
00:43:27.168 --> 00:43:28.875
Do you know if she's seen a doctor?

595
00:43:30.296 --> 00:43:32.208
Such a thing would never occur to me.

596
00:43:32.757 --> 00:43:34.498
She seems like such a nice girl.

597
00:43:34.925 --> 00:43:36.791
Nice girls are human, my dear.

598
00:43:48.522 --> 00:43:49.522
Hi.

599
00:43:56.655 --> 00:43:59.363
- What are you doing?
- I'm moving.


600
00:44:00.409 --> 00:44:01.775
Anita, what's happened?

601
00:44:01.869 --> 00:44:03.781
How could you have done this to me?

602
00:44:04.163 --> 00:44:05.870
- How could you?
- Do what?


603
00:44:05.956 --> 00:44:07.572
I don't know what you're talking about.

604
00:44:07.917 --> 00:44:09.328
What business was it of yours

605
00:44:09.418 --> 00:44:11.125
if I went to the country with Giorgio?

606
00:44:11.212 --> 00:44:12.874
What right had you to tell Burgoyne

607
00:44:12.963 --> 00:44:15.205
or explain to him I'm not
going home to get married?


608
00:44:15.299 --> 00:44:16.631
Well, he asked me why...

609
00:44:16.967 --> 00:44:18.458
I only thought I was helping you.

610
00:44:18.552 --> 00:44:20.509
Did you think you were helping
by telling him


611
00:44:20.596 --> 00:44:21.916
I spent the weekend with Giorgio?

612
00:44:21.972 --> 00:44:23.679
I didn't say it that way.

613
00:44:25.101 --> 00:44:27.844
Well, he asked me if I wanted
to consult his doctor.


614
00:44:29.105 --> 00:44:31.472
He said the office would be
very happy to pay for it.


615
00:44:31.982 --> 00:44:33.974
He wanted to know how long
this had been going on.


616
00:44:35.069 --> 00:44:36.185
Anita, I...

617
00:44:37.738 --> 00:44:39.149
I'm sorry.

618
00:44:40.533 --> 00:44:44.277
Well... I'm going home
in a few days anyway,


619
00:44:44.370 --> 00:44:47.704
so in the meantime,
you stay here in the apartment.


620
00:44:48.582 --> 00:44:50.494
I'm going to stay someplace by myself.

621
00:44:50.918 --> 00:44:53.126
Anita, will you please listen to me?

622
00:44:53.254 --> 00:44:55.371
Look, I can't remember what
I said to Mr. Burgoyne,


623
00:44:55.506 --> 00:44:56.963
but believe me, it's been distorted.

624
00:44:57.049 --> 00:44:58.790
Well, he fired Giorgio!

625
00:44:59.760 --> 00:45:01.001
Oh, no.

626
00:45:02.096 --> 00:45:04.179
He fired him without a recommendation.

627
00:45:04.849 --> 00:45:06.841
Jobs are hard to get
without a recommendation.


628
00:45:07.893 --> 00:45:10.010
He wanted to be
a lawyer. Now he can't.

629
00:45:11.272 --> 00:45:13.855
We certainly left him with
something to remember us by.


630
00:45:13.983 --> 00:45:15.019
Anita!

631
00:46:08.037 --> 00:46:10.495
- Hello, Giorgio.
- Anita.


632
00:46:11.582 --> 00:46:15.701
You should not have come here.
How did you find this place?


633
00:46:16.128 --> 00:46:18.085
I looked your address up
in the office files.


634
00:46:19.340 --> 00:46:21.627
- I cannot ask you in.
- Please.


635
00:46:29.725 --> 00:46:31.216
It's not a good place.

636
00:46:32.520 --> 00:46:34.386
Burgoyne told me why he fired you.

637
00:46:35.064 --> 00:46:36.771
I knew the rules. I broke them.

638
00:46:37.650 --> 00:46:39.437
I cannot honestly say I regret it.

639
00:46:40.152 --> 00:46:41.359
What are you going to do?

640
00:46:42.071 --> 00:46:43.733
I shall try for another position.

641
00:46:44.823 --> 00:46:47.236
Failing that, I can always
return to my family.


642
00:46:47.785 --> 00:46:49.026
It's not hopeless.

643
00:46:50.454 --> 00:46:51.740
If you'll have to go home,

644
00:46:52.331 --> 00:46:54.539
you won't be able
to continue your studies.


645
00:46:55.251 --> 00:46:56.787
Perhaps I shouldn't be a lawyer

646
00:46:56.877 --> 00:46:59.119
if I cannot honor simple office rules.

647
00:46:59.213 --> 00:47:01.375
Look, don't justify Burgoyne!

648
00:47:01.840 --> 00:47:03.456
This could cost you your career.

649
00:47:03.717 --> 00:47:05.253
I'm not gonna let
him do it to you.

650
00:47:05.386 --> 00:47:06.467
Anita.

651
00:47:06.554 --> 00:47:10.013
You must not be angry.
I knew what I was doing.


652
00:47:10.599 --> 00:47:13.137
This happened. I will accept
the consequences.


653
00:47:13.227 --> 00:47:15.514
I'm gonna go back to him
and make him take you back.


654
00:47:15.646 --> 00:47:16.932
You will only convince him

655
00:47:17.022 --> 00:47:18.684
he acted wisely in the first place.

656
00:47:18.857 --> 00:47:21.645
But I can't just go away,

657
00:47:22.194 --> 00:47:24.902
leaving you here to face
a problem I created for you.


658
00:47:26.031 --> 00:47:28.694
You will go back to America,
as you have to,


659
00:47:29.785 --> 00:47:32.277
and I will return to
our farm, if I must.

660
00:47:34.582 --> 00:47:35.789
Giorgio,

661
00:47:36.083 --> 00:47:38.791
I have a day or two left
before I have to go back.


662
00:47:40.254 --> 00:47:43.247
Would it help you at all
if we spent them together?


663
00:47:48.262 --> 00:47:49.378
Anita.

664
00:47:50.514 --> 00:47:51.755
Oh, <i>cara.</i>

665
00:48:08.574 --> 00:48:11.442
No. What could I offer you?

666
00:48:11.910 --> 00:48:15.244
I have no job. In the end,
you have to leave anyhow.


667
00:48:15.331 --> 00:48:16.572
You are not free.

668
00:48:16.665 --> 00:48:18.622
I'm free to do anything I please!

669
00:48:18.709 --> 00:48:20.416
You are going home to be married.

670
00:48:20.502 --> 00:48:23.745
I'm not going to be married.
I'm not even engaged.


671
00:48:24.632 --> 00:48:25.873
I only told Burgoyne that

672
00:48:25.966 --> 00:48:28.003
as an excuse for leaving the agency.

673
00:48:31.555 --> 00:48:32.796
There is no one?

674
00:48:33.807 --> 00:48:35.764
There's no one.

675
00:48:54.912 --> 00:48:57.120
- Come in, <i>signorina.</i>
- Thank you.


676
00:49:01.710 --> 00:49:03.793
- Frances!
- Yes?


677
00:49:05.464 --> 00:49:07.205
- Hello, Maria.
- Hello.


678
00:49:07.591 --> 00:49:08.627
Should I have phoned?

679
00:49:08.842 --> 00:49:10.322
No, of course not. Thank you, Louisa.

680
00:49:10.469 --> 00:49:12.461
- What is it?
- I can't find Anita.


681
00:49:14.181 --> 00:49:15.717
I've checked all the hotels.

682
00:49:15.808 --> 00:49:17.848
She hasn't been back,
she hasn't been to the office.


683
00:49:19.353 --> 00:49:20.810
I'm just worried sick.

684
00:49:20.896 --> 00:49:22.888
Well, I don't think
we need worry about it.


685
00:49:23.023 --> 00:49:24.434
Anita's hurt and unhappy,

686
00:49:24.525 --> 00:49:27.108
and she probably wants to
be alone for a few days.


687
00:49:27.194 --> 00:49:29.231
She'll show up. 
Did you talk to Burgoyne?

688
00:49:30.114 --> 00:49:31.446
He won't take Giorgio back.

689
00:49:31.532 --> 00:49:33.569
Oh! He's a fool.

690
00:49:33.784 --> 00:49:36.572
- What can we do?
- Nothing at the moment.


691
00:49:37.246 --> 00:49:39.659
Now, stop worrying about it.
It wasn't your fault.


692
00:49:40.791 --> 00:49:43.158
Look, do you think Mr. Shadwell

693
00:49:43.293 --> 00:49:45.205
could get Giorgio's job back for him?

694
00:49:45.462 --> 00:49:48.079
- That would help.
- Well, we'll see.


695
00:49:48.632 --> 00:49:50.544
I'm going over to the museum
to pick him up now.


696
00:49:50.968 --> 00:49:52.254
Why don't you come along?

697
00:50:00.060 --> 00:50:01.705
You haven't been to
the museum yet, have you?


698
00:50:01.729 --> 00:50:02.765
No.

699
00:50:02.855 --> 00:50:05.689
Museums I can do without.
I was born in one.


700
00:50:05.774 --> 00:50:07.481
- You were?
- Sure.


701
00:50:07.818 --> 00:50:09.980
My dad had an Indian museum
on the highway,


702
00:50:10.070 --> 00:50:11.436
next to his gas station.

703
00:50:11.739 --> 00:50:13.856
It was free with ten gallons of gas.

704
00:50:14.032 --> 00:50:15.927
Well, this one has a different
kind of an attraction.


705
00:50:15.951 --> 00:50:17.158
What?

706
00:50:17.244 --> 00:50:19.531
For one thing, Prince Dino
is there with Shadwell


707
00:50:19.663 --> 00:50:21.450
discussing some paintings he's donating.

708
00:50:21.540 --> 00:50:22.621
Oh.

709
00:50:22.791 --> 00:50:24.248
Wouldn't you like to see him again?

710
00:50:24.376 --> 00:50:26.163
Hmm, he'd just love to see me.

711
00:50:26.253 --> 00:50:27.960
You could discuss art with him.

712
00:50:28.505 --> 00:50:31.373
Oh, that would be a change.
What does he collect, nudes?


713
00:50:32.468 --> 00:50:35.632
No, as a matter of fact,
he's mad about modern paintings.


714
00:50:35.721 --> 00:50:37.883
Oh, that's a side I'd never suspect.

715
00:50:37.973 --> 00:50:39.805
Why don't you show
him you have a side

716
00:50:39.892 --> 00:50:41.008
he'd never suspect?

717
00:50:41.101 --> 00:50:44.265
Show him you have a mind.

718
00:50:44.354 --> 00:50:47.347
Oh, I love you,
but I couldn't fool a fool.


719
00:50:47.441 --> 00:50:49.023
I don't know anything about art.

720
00:50:49.109 --> 00:50:50.316
Give it a try.

721
00:50:50.402 --> 00:50:52.143
You might end up meeting his mother.

722
00:50:53.280 --> 00:50:55.397
And why should I
want to meet his mother?

723
00:50:55.866 --> 00:50:58.609
Meeting Mama in Italy
is the first step to the altar.


724
00:51:00.788 --> 00:51:05.579
Oh. Well, um...
Let's discuss art some more.


725
00:51:16.345 --> 00:51:18.382
Don't forget, Neo
-Impressionism.

726
00:51:19.473 --> 00:51:22.466
Neo
-Impressionist. Neo
-Impressionist.

727
00:51:23.811 --> 00:51:25.427
Neo
-Impressionist.

728
00:51:26.480 --> 00:51:29.598
Harmony of color... and infinity.

729
00:51:29.691 --> 00:51:30.852
You'll do.

730
00:51:38.992 --> 00:51:40.574
How can you say it bores you?

731
00:51:40.661 --> 00:51:42.152
You, with your heritage.

732
00:51:42.329 --> 00:51:44.992
My heritage included
a castle with no plumbing,


733
00:51:45.541 --> 00:51:49.080
but I happen to prefer
running water and modern art.


734
00:51:50.045 --> 00:51:52.232
You'll forgive me if I don't
take your opinion seriously.


735
00:51:52.256 --> 00:51:54.526
Don't forget, I knew you when
you were still running around


736
00:51:54.550 --> 00:51:56.041
in three-cornered pants.

737
00:51:56.468 --> 00:51:58.960
Hello. I'm Maria Williams.

738
00:51:59.054 --> 00:52:00.761
We met at the Burgoyne's, Mr. Shadwell,

739
00:52:01.014 --> 00:52:02.721
but I'm sure you don't remember me.

740
00:52:02.933 --> 00:52:06.142
You're quite wrong.
I remember you very well.


741
00:52:06.645 --> 00:52:08.056
It's the party I've forgotten.

742
00:52:08.146 --> 00:52:10.103
- How do you do, Miss Williams?
- Hello.


743
00:52:10.357 --> 00:52:11.848
I drove over with Miss Frances.

744
00:52:11.942 --> 00:52:14.302
She asked me to tell you that
she's waiting for you outside.


745
00:52:14.361 --> 00:52:16.273
Punctuality is the vice of virtuous women.

746
00:52:16.363 --> 00:52:17.729
May I drop you?

747
00:52:17.823 --> 00:52:19.155
No, thank you. 
I have my car.

748
00:52:19.658 --> 00:52:21.991
Dino, take the advice of an old friend.

749
00:52:23.036 --> 00:52:24.996
Don't treat a work of art
as you do an automobile,


750
00:52:25.163 --> 00:52:27.405
turning it in for
a new model every year.

751
00:52:27.708 --> 00:52:30.200
Oh, we can't live in
the past forever, Mr. Shadwell.


752
00:52:30.294 --> 00:52:32.035
- Exactly.
- Nonsense.


753
00:52:32.129 --> 00:52:34.291
We live in the past
from the moment we're born.


754
00:52:34.631 --> 00:52:38.716
Well, personally, I think that heritage
can sometimes shackle art.


755
00:52:39.511 --> 00:52:40.968
Not to forget plumbing.

756
00:52:41.763 --> 00:52:43.550
- Good day, Miss Williams.
- Good day.


757
00:52:43.640 --> 00:52:45.381
I shall leave heretics to their heritage.

758
00:52:51.231 --> 00:52:53.473
Well, it's very nice to see you again.

759
00:52:55.277 --> 00:52:56.277
Oh, I wonder,

760
00:52:56.320 --> 00:52:59.108
do you know if the museum
has any modern art?


761
00:52:59.615 --> 00:53:01.356
Modern? In what sense?

762
00:53:02.492 --> 00:53:04.529
Now, you really will think I'm a heretic,

763
00:53:04.661 --> 00:53:07.529
but I'm passionately
interested in the, uh...


764
00:53:07.956 --> 00:53:09.492
Neo
-Impressionists.

765
00:53:10.542 --> 00:53:11.542
You are?

766
00:53:12.002 --> 00:53:13.868
Oh, I thought you'd be outraged.

767
00:53:13.962 --> 00:53:16.579
But, yes, I'm mad about them.

768
00:53:16.840 --> 00:53:19.378
As a matter of fact,
I'm a Neo-Impressionist myself.


769
00:53:20.469 --> 00:53:23.132
There's a fine collection here.
May I show you the room?


770
00:53:24.723 --> 00:53:26.840
- Well...
- This way.


771
00:53:34.149 --> 00:53:35.811
Unless I missed my guess,

772
00:53:36.568 --> 00:53:38.059
sending that girl in to get me

773
00:53:38.153 --> 00:53:40.110
was a feminine intrigue of yours.

774
00:53:40.656 --> 00:53:41.772
Am I right?

775
00:53:41.865 --> 00:53:43.572
Whatever makes you think that?

776
00:53:43.659 --> 00:53:44.866
Don't be evasive.

777
00:53:45.494 --> 00:53:48.237
Dino told me
of your interference in Venice.


778
00:53:49.247 --> 00:53:51.364
What are you trying to be? Mother Goose?

779
00:53:51.500 --> 00:53:54.083
- Maria is a friend of mine.
- And Dino is a friend of mine.


780
00:53:54.962 --> 00:53:56.578
Let people lead their own lives.

781
00:53:57.297 --> 00:53:59.129
They have absolutely nothing in common.

782
00:54:00.217 --> 00:54:01.298
You'd be surprised.

783
00:54:01.468 --> 00:54:04.176
Dino's fond of art,
and Maria was born in a museum.


784
00:54:04.596 --> 00:54:07.009
- She was born where?
- Ask her yourself.


785
00:54:07.099 --> 00:54:09.807
Her father is curator
of a museum, out west.


786
00:54:11.186 --> 00:54:13.599
You're right. I am surprised.

787
00:54:25.367 --> 00:54:28.075
- Do you like it?
- How can you ask?


788
00:54:29.121 --> 00:54:30.487
Well, does it speak to you?

789
00:54:31.039 --> 00:54:32.701
Oh, yes, definitely.

790
00:54:33.166 --> 00:54:36.204
Well then, what does it tell you?
What does it say?


791
00:54:37.838 --> 00:54:40.956
Well, different pictures
say different things


792
00:54:41.216 --> 00:54:42.297
to different people.

793
00:54:42.384 --> 00:54:44.501
Yes, but the right paintings
say the right things


794
00:54:45.053 --> 00:54:46.169
to the right people.

795
00:54:46.763 --> 00:54:48.425
Yes, and you're so right.

796
00:54:49.766 --> 00:54:51.052
Well, this...

797
00:54:52.728 --> 00:54:56.642
Now, this seems to have a...
A feeling of space.


798
00:54:57.357 --> 00:55:01.192
Those lines that carry you off
into the distance.


799
00:55:02.738 --> 00:55:05.776
Oh, infinity is... Is so lonely.

800
00:55:06.324 --> 00:55:08.782
Yes, it makes me want to cry.

801
00:55:10.162 --> 00:55:11.573
You surprise me.

802
00:55:12.789 --> 00:55:14.746
I could not have put it better myself.

803
00:55:16.960 --> 00:55:19.077
Oh, well, you mustn't let me keep you.

804
00:55:19.629 --> 00:55:22.212
I'm just going to sit here
a while and absorb it.


805
00:55:22.466 --> 00:55:26.130
If I may, I'll
sit here and absorb also.

806
00:55:49.117 --> 00:55:51.325
It was such an enjoyable afternoon.

807
00:55:51.703 --> 00:55:52.944
What are you going to do now?

808
00:55:53.580 --> 00:55:54.661
Now?

809
00:55:55.040 --> 00:55:57.327
Well, I'm going to
go inside and sit down

810
00:55:57.417 --> 00:55:59.249
and just think quietly

811
00:55:59.336 --> 00:56:01.202
about all those lovely paintings.

812
00:56:03.215 --> 00:56:05.457
You must think me silly
to feel so deeply about art.


813
00:56:05.550 --> 00:56:09.339
Oh, not at all. One seldom meets
an American girl with your sensitivity,


814
00:56:09.429 --> 00:56:11.842
your sense of appreciation.
It's wonderful.


815
00:56:11.932 --> 00:56:13.343
Ah, well, if that is so,

816
00:56:13.433 --> 00:56:15.425
it's probably because I'm half Italian.

817
00:56:16.436 --> 00:56:20.020
- You are half Italian?
- Well, actually, three-quarters.


818
00:56:20.357 --> 00:56:22.144
But I resemble my Irish grandmother.

819
00:56:22.359 --> 00:56:24.897
Now, imagine! Three-quarters.

820
00:56:25.070 --> 00:56:27.858
Mm, well, that's why
I took this job in Rome. I...


821
00:56:28.365 --> 00:56:30.152
I wanted to be near my own kind.

822
00:56:32.160 --> 00:56:34.026
Well, thank you again
for dropping me here.


823
00:56:34.121 --> 00:56:35.890
I must hurry in.
My friends are waiting for me.


824
00:56:35.914 --> 00:56:37.121
Now, I shall see you again?

825
00:56:38.166 --> 00:56:41.330
I don't know. You see,
I'm rather afraid of you.


826
00:56:41.419 --> 00:56:43.285
Afraid? Of me?

827
00:56:43.380 --> 00:56:45.542
Oh, not because of your reputation.

828
00:56:45.632 --> 00:56:49.376
But, you see, I've discovered
you have an exciting mind.


829
00:56:49.886 --> 00:56:52.173
Something that handsome men rarely have.

830
00:56:52.264 --> 00:56:55.132
And the combination might be too much

831
00:56:55.225 --> 00:56:57.433
for someone as responsive as I am.

832
00:56:58.061 --> 00:57:00.519
Well, goodbye, and thank you again.

833
00:57:29.426 --> 00:57:30.883
You sent for me<i>, signorina?</i>

834
00:57:31.386 --> 00:57:34.470
Yes. I'm told that
the Prince Dino di Cessi


835
00:57:34.681 --> 00:57:35.922
often dines here.

836
00:57:36.224 --> 00:57:37.681
He is a friend of the <i>signorina's?</i>

837
00:57:37.809 --> 00:57:38.809
Oh, yes.

838
00:57:38.852 --> 00:57:41.185
And I'm giving a small
dinner party for him,


839
00:57:41.354 --> 00:57:43.095
and I thought you might
be able to tell me

840
00:57:43.190 --> 00:57:45.022
what his favorite dish is.

841
00:57:45.150 --> 00:57:46.150
Of course.

842
00:57:46.234 --> 00:57:49.727
He is particularly fond of
<i>saltimbocca alla Romana.</i>


843
00:57:49.821 --> 00:57:51.107
Oh. Just a moment.

844
00:57:51.865 --> 00:57:54.733
<i>- Saltimbocca...
- Alla Romana.</i>


845
00:57:54.826 --> 00:57:58.069
<i>- Alla Romana.</i>
- And his favorite wine?


846
00:57:58.163 --> 00:58:01.201
Oh... Oh, yes. 
Lacrima Christi.

847
00:58:01.750 --> 00:58:04.288
Lacrima Christi.

848
00:58:05.754 --> 00:58:07.711
Thank you. Thank you very much.

849
00:58:07.923 --> 00:58:09.835
Would the <i>signorina</i> like to order now?

850
00:58:10.300 --> 00:58:13.134
Yes. I'll have a cup of coffee, please.

851
00:58:14.221 --> 00:58:15.632
A cup of coffee.

852
00:58:16.223 --> 00:58:19.637
It is his favorite opera,
<i>signorina</i>. This I know.


853
00:58:19.726 --> 00:58:23.345
Oh, no. No, I know
that he likes, uh... Wagner.


854
00:58:23.438 --> 00:58:27.557
Wagner? That is impossible!
He likes Italian opera.


855
00:58:27.651 --> 00:58:30.314
I heard, myself, him say many times

856
00:58:30.445 --> 00:58:33.779
that German music
assails the ear with its fist.


857
00:58:34.074 --> 00:58:37.192
Italian caresses with its fingertips.

858
00:58:37.285 --> 00:58:39.242
Well, thank you.

859
00:59:51.151 --> 00:59:52.983
Will you excuse me?
I'll join you presently.


860
00:59:53.111 --> 00:59:54.111
Yes, of course.

861
00:59:54.279 --> 00:59:55.565
<i>Buona sera, Dino. 
Come stai?</i>

862
00:59:55.697 --> 00:59:57.939
Ah, my friend. 
You must sit with us.

863
00:59:58.074 --> 00:59:59.281
I can only stay a moment.

864
00:59:59.409 --> 01:00:00.490
I'm with the Burgoynes,

865
01:00:00.577 --> 01:00:02.257
and I wouldn't want
to inflict them on you.


866
01:00:03.580 --> 01:00:05.663
- How do you do, Miss Williams?
- How do you do?


867
01:00:06.166 --> 01:00:09.159
I saw you at the opera. 
Did you enjoy it?

868
01:00:09.336 --> 01:00:10.827
Rossini is one of her favorites.

869
01:00:10.920 --> 01:00:11.920
Indeed.

870
01:00:12.297 --> 01:00:15.506
I do wish Alvarez were
less limited in his tessitura.


871
01:00:16.259 --> 01:00:17.295
Don't you?

872
01:00:18.845 --> 01:00:19.961
Do you?

873
01:00:20.305 --> 01:00:23.673
- No. No, not at all.
- I don't either.


874
01:00:23.767 --> 01:00:25.303
But surely you disagree

875
01:00:25.393 --> 01:00:27.476
about the various tempi of the conductor?

876
01:00:28.396 --> 01:00:29.396
Why?

877
01:00:29.481 --> 01:00:32.724
Now, my friend, we found
no fault with this performance.


878
01:00:33.443 --> 01:00:34.775
You cannot spoil it for us.

879
01:00:34.861 --> 01:00:36.898
Oh, I'm sure Mr. Shadwell
wouldn't do that.


880
01:00:37.364 --> 01:00:40.027
I... It's just that he's a perfectionist.

881
01:00:40.116 --> 01:00:42.574
- Thank you.
- I know that from your books.


882
01:00:42.994 --> 01:00:45.611
- Which one?
- All of them.


883
01:00:47.874 --> 01:00:50.287
Well, you've certainly
covered a lot of territory.


884
01:00:51.586 --> 01:00:53.452
Dino, you're in the hands of an expert.

885
01:00:54.756 --> 01:00:57.169
Good evening, Miss Williams.
<i>Arrivederci, caro.</i>


886
01:00:57.258 --> 01:00:58.258
<i>Ciao.</i>

887
01:01:02.180 --> 01:01:03.387
He likes you.

888
01:01:04.140 --> 01:01:06.223
And I'm glad, because he's my friend.

889
01:01:07.185 --> 01:01:09.552
Now, what shall we have?

890
01:01:11.606 --> 01:01:13.188
Well, I know this is mad,

891
01:01:13.274 --> 01:01:17.188
but I would just love some
<i>saltimbocca alla Romana.</i>


892
01:01:17.278 --> 01:01:18.278
Excellent!

893
01:01:18.363 --> 01:01:20.650
<i>Saltimbocca alla Romana</i>
is a favorite of mine.


894
01:01:21.282 --> 01:01:23.194
Now, what would you
like to drink with it?

895
01:01:25.078 --> 01:01:27.866
Do you suppose they'd have
some Lacrima Christi?


896
01:01:27.956 --> 01:01:29.117
But of course!

897
01:01:29.207 --> 01:01:30.664
Now, you know, Maria,

898
01:01:30.750 --> 01:01:32.912
it is astounding
how much we have in common.


899
01:01:33.002 --> 01:01:35.585
Well, you're very kind.

900
01:01:35.922 --> 01:01:38.255
Italians certainly have
mastered the art of gallantry.


901
01:01:38.341 --> 01:01:39.341
But it's true.

902
01:01:40.260 --> 01:01:42.422
Well, it's very sweet
of you to say so,

903
01:01:42.554 --> 01:01:44.762
but you needn't pretend
that you like everything I like.


904
01:01:44.931 --> 01:01:47.719
- It's too tiresome for you.
- But I swear it's true.


905
01:01:47.976 --> 01:01:51.686
I can think of nothing on which
we disagree. It's amazing.


906
01:01:52.105 --> 01:01:53.892
You really are a nice person.

907
01:01:54.023 --> 01:01:56.436
You try so hard to
make a girl feel that

908
01:01:56.651 --> 01:01:58.438
she's chosen the right thing.

909
01:01:59.028 --> 01:02:00.985
And whether it's true or not,
isn't important.


910
01:02:01.197 --> 01:02:02.779
It's the motive that counts.

911
01:02:03.074 --> 01:02:04.736
- Don't you think so?
- Of course.


912
01:02:04.826 --> 01:02:06.988
Which proves that we agree on everything.

913
01:02:15.086 --> 01:02:17.169
<i>Grazie.</i>

914
01:02:24.387 --> 01:02:25.673
What's the matter?

915
01:02:27.307 --> 01:02:28.307
Maria...

916
01:02:29.809 --> 01:02:31.175
there is something I want.

917
01:02:32.103 --> 01:02:33.103
Well, what?

918
01:02:33.605 --> 01:02:35.562
I should like to
have you meet my mother.

919
01:02:40.320 --> 01:02:41.481
Well, if you like.

920
01:02:41.863 --> 01:02:42.863
Sunday?

921
01:02:44.157 --> 01:02:45.193
So soon?

922
01:02:48.077 --> 01:02:49.409
I shall call for you.

923
01:03:27.075 --> 01:03:28.361
Oh, you're early.

924
01:03:29.869 --> 01:03:31.701
You play the piccolo too?

925
01:03:32.288 --> 01:03:34.325
No, but I've always wanted to learn.

926
01:03:34.457 --> 01:03:36.777
If you're going to study music,
Rome is the place to do it.


927
01:03:38.044 --> 01:03:39.501
But I also play the piccolo!

928
01:03:40.463 --> 01:03:42.170
Now, Dino, you must stop saying

929
01:03:42.257 --> 01:03:44.044
that you like everything I like.

930
01:03:44.133 --> 01:03:45.973
You're going to make me
think you're insincere.


931
01:03:46.010 --> 01:03:47.967
But I <i>do</i> play the piccolo. Look.

932
01:03:56.521 --> 01:03:59.480
- You see?
- But you play like an angel.


933
01:04:02.151 --> 01:04:05.064
Perhaps someday we can play duets.

934
01:04:06.406 --> 01:04:07.738
I should like that.

935
01:04:15.748 --> 01:04:18.616
Well, I think that we should not
keep my mother waiting.


936
01:05:13.431 --> 01:05:14.512
Maria?

937
01:05:15.016 --> 01:05:17.053
- Maria, this is my mother.
- How do you do?


938
01:05:17.727 --> 01:05:20.094
It was good of you
to come to see me.

939
01:05:21.606 --> 01:05:22.642
Thank you.

940
01:05:23.941 --> 01:05:27.525
- Isn't she lovely, Mother?
- You failed to do her justice.


941
01:05:29.614 --> 01:05:32.482
Dino, bring my blue shawl. It is chilly.

942
01:05:32.700 --> 01:05:35.408
Uh... But, Mother,
you have your blue shawl.


943
01:05:36.037 --> 01:05:37.619
Take it away. It is warm.

944
01:05:37.955 --> 01:05:39.537
Go away, Dino.

945
01:05:39.749 --> 01:05:42.583
I want to talk to Maria alone
for a moment.


946
01:05:47.006 --> 01:05:49.589
- Will you have a cigarette?
- No, thank you.


947
01:05:56.516 --> 01:06:00.510
It's a lovely day, isn't it?

948
01:06:00.853 --> 01:06:03.812
I want to tell you,
I was predisposed to like you.


949
01:06:04.357 --> 01:06:05.393
You were? Why?

950
01:06:05.483 --> 01:06:08.226
You have made my son happy.
For that, I am grateful.


951
01:06:09.153 --> 01:06:10.610
Oh, I shall not live forever.

952
01:06:10.822 --> 01:06:12.404
It was a matter of concern to me

953
01:06:12.490 --> 01:06:14.732
that he should depend
on me for understanding.


954
01:06:14.826 --> 01:06:15.826
Well, I really haven't...

955
01:06:15.910 --> 01:06:18.527
My son tells me you are half Italian.

956
01:06:20.581 --> 01:06:23.494
Oh, yes, uh... 
Actually three-quarters.

957
01:06:24.043 --> 01:06:25.124
Your father?

958
01:06:25.628 --> 01:06:27.039
Yes, but, um...

959
01:06:27.130 --> 01:06:30.373
I... I really didn't know him.
He died when I was a baby.


960
01:06:30.466 --> 01:06:31.547
A pity.

961
01:06:31.801 --> 01:06:34.464
My son also lost his father
when he was a child.


962
01:06:34.971 --> 01:06:37.588
You both have an early tragedy
in your lives.


963
01:06:37.932 --> 01:06:41.346
Oh, it is good that two people
should start with understanding.


964
01:06:42.729 --> 01:06:44.391
Yes, I... I guess so.

965
01:06:44.856 --> 01:06:47.018
Dino, you are much too quick.

966
01:06:47.859 --> 01:06:49.100
Now, Mother,

967
01:06:49.193 --> 01:06:51.276
I shall tell you something
that will amaze you.


968
01:06:51.738 --> 01:06:54.276
Do you know that she plays the piccolo?

969
01:06:55.742 --> 01:06:57.028
I am amazed.

970
01:06:57.118 --> 01:06:59.531
Well, I don't, really. 
I'm just beginning.

971
01:06:59.620 --> 01:07:01.077
Oh, you are modest.

972
01:07:02.415 --> 01:07:04.748
Dino, bring us some wine.
We shall drink a toast.


973
01:07:04.834 --> 01:07:06.325
And do you know what wine she likes?

974
01:07:06.753 --> 01:07:08.585
- Lacrima Christi!
- No!


975
01:07:08.713 --> 01:07:10.375
- Yes.
- Yes?


976
01:07:11.132 --> 01:07:12.132
Yes.

977
01:07:12.550 --> 01:07:14.542
- No.
- Yes!


978
01:07:19.932 --> 01:07:22.140
I'm very glad that you like my mother.

979
01:07:22.685 --> 01:07:24.392
How could I help but like her?

980
01:07:24.729 --> 01:07:27.187
She's the only woman
I've ever trusted completely.


981
01:07:27.398 --> 01:07:28.514
Until I met you.

982
01:07:29.567 --> 01:07:30.567
Oh.

983
01:08:00.598 --> 01:08:02.760
There is something I would
like to say to you, Maria.


984
01:08:03.267 --> 01:08:04.267
Yes?

985
01:08:04.602 --> 01:08:08.061
But first I should like
to explain to you that


986
01:08:08.773 --> 01:08:11.436
what experiences
I have had in my life before


987
01:08:11.776 --> 01:08:14.189
have left me... suspicious.

988
01:08:14.695 --> 01:08:16.778
But you're not the least bit suspicious.

989
01:08:17.281 --> 01:08:19.147
That's one of the
things I like about you.

990
01:08:19.242 --> 01:08:20.699
I hide it well.

991
01:08:21.244 --> 01:08:24.362
But always beneath... there was cynicism.

992
01:08:25.748 --> 01:08:29.116
I say "was," because
since knowing you, it is gone.


993
01:08:30.211 --> 01:08:32.578
Oh, Maria, it is good
to be free of doubt,

994
01:08:33.172 --> 01:08:36.131
to find someone
that you can trust completely.


995
01:08:36.592 --> 01:08:38.629
- Dino, I... I think...
- No, wait.


996
01:08:39.387 --> 01:08:41.003
First I want to tell you something.

997
01:08:41.889 --> 01:08:46.259
Here, where the heart
asks only to be trusted,


998
01:08:47.603 --> 01:08:48.872
I must tell you, 
Maria, that I...

999
01:08:48.896 --> 01:08:51.604
Dino, please don't say anything more.

1000
01:08:53.568 --> 01:08:56.527
Could it be possible that
I misunderstood how you feel?


1001
01:08:56.612 --> 01:08:58.854
- Oh, no.
- Well, then why should I not speak?


1002
01:09:01.617 --> 01:09:03.950
Because there's something
I have to tell you first.


1003
01:09:05.746 --> 01:09:07.988
This may hurt you,
but I must say it.

1004
01:09:10.418 --> 01:09:11.625
Oh, Dino.

1005
01:09:15.172 --> 01:09:18.916
I've lied to you
from the first moment we met.


1006
01:09:19.719 --> 01:09:23.303
I've done nothing to restore
your faith or your trust.


1007
01:09:23.973 --> 01:09:26.681
I went after you
with a well-organized system.


1008
01:09:28.811 --> 01:09:30.803
- You are making a joke.
- No, I'm not.


1009
01:09:32.273 --> 01:09:35.141
Look. Look, I... I...

1010
01:09:36.694 --> 01:09:40.529
I made a record of everything about you.

1011
01:09:41.324 --> 01:09:43.566
What pleased you, what displeased you.

1012
01:09:44.493 --> 01:09:47.406
And then I pretended to like
everything that you liked.


1013
01:09:48.372 --> 01:09:52.161
Music and food, everything.

1014
01:09:54.545 --> 01:09:55.545
And you...

1015
01:09:56.005 --> 01:10:00.045
You were as trusting as a lamb.
You didn't have a chance.


1016
01:10:02.428 --> 01:10:05.341
- I cannot believe this.
- Well, it's true.


1017
01:10:06.223 --> 01:10:09.637
Look, I don't know opera from boogie

1018
01:10:09.810 --> 01:10:13.349
or Lacrima Christi from Corpus Christi.

1019
01:10:13.814 --> 01:10:15.601
And I loathe the piccolo.

1020
01:10:17.360 --> 01:10:18.476
Dino, if...

1021
01:10:20.488 --> 01:10:23.151
I'm sorry.

1022
01:10:35.419 --> 01:10:38.753
- Anita! When did you get back?
- Last night.


1023
01:10:38.881 --> 01:10:40.668
- Does Maria know?
- Yes.


1024
01:10:40.758 --> 01:10:42.499
Oh, darling, I'm glad to see you.

1025
01:10:42.635 --> 01:10:44.592
We've looked for you
in every hotel in Rome.


1026
01:10:44.679 --> 01:10:45.920
Maria told me.

1027
01:10:46.555 --> 01:10:49.548
I've been in the country
with Giorgio's family.


1028
01:10:49.642 --> 01:10:51.634
We're trying to get Burgoyne
to take Giorgio back.


1029
01:10:51.727 --> 01:10:53.138
I'm sure he'll apologize to you

1030
01:10:53.229 --> 01:10:55.812
for all those nasty suspicions
before you leave.


1031
01:10:56.774 --> 01:10:58.356
He owes me no apology.

1032
01:10:59.652 --> 01:11:01.939
Anyway, I'm going home as planned.

1033
01:11:02.029 --> 01:11:03.611
What about Giorgio?

1034
01:11:05.157 --> 01:11:06.318
What about him?

1035
01:11:06.909 --> 01:11:09.071
Had you thought of staying
and marrying him?


1036
01:11:10.997 --> 01:11:12.579
He doesn't think we should.

1037
01:11:13.124 --> 01:11:14.865
But you're obviously in love with him.

1038
01:11:15.501 --> 01:11:17.117
Well, he's dreadfully poor.

1039
01:11:18.254 --> 01:11:20.792
Even with his job,
he can barely support himself.


1040
01:11:21.716 --> 01:11:23.173
He'd have to give up his studies

1041
01:11:23.259 --> 01:11:24.875
or take me to live with his people.

1042
01:11:26.303 --> 01:11:28.090
And he says either way it wouldn't work.

1043
01:11:28.806 --> 01:11:31.719
Well, how do you feel about it?

1044
01:11:31.809 --> 01:11:33.300
Oh, my darling!

1045
01:11:34.103 --> 01:11:35.435
I'm so sorry.

1046
01:11:36.480 --> 01:11:38.016
Is there anything I can do?

1047
01:11:39.108 --> 01:11:41.065
Just leave me alone, please.

1048
01:11:57.376 --> 01:11:59.959
- Well, what are you doing?
- Packing.


1049
01:12:00.463 --> 01:12:02.079
I can see that. But why?

1050
01:12:02.923 --> 01:12:04.164
I'm going home.

1051
01:12:05.426 --> 01:12:06.792
I'm going back with Anita.

1052
01:12:09.013 --> 01:12:10.720
He hasn't even tried to see me.

1053
01:12:12.058 --> 01:12:13.058
Oh, dear.

1054
01:12:16.896 --> 01:12:18.762
Never knew I could feel this way.

1055
01:12:20.274 --> 01:12:21.515
It's pretty awful.

1056
01:12:21.776 --> 01:12:24.814
I know it is. It's
awful, for both of you.

1057
01:12:27.198 --> 01:12:29.611
Well, I hope you won't mind
being alone in the apartment,


1058
01:12:30.826 --> 01:12:32.283
but I couldn't stay on, you know.

1059
01:12:33.245 --> 01:12:34.736
Of course not.

1060
01:12:37.875 --> 01:12:40.458
I'm glad I'm not young
and vulnerable anymore.


1061
01:12:50.387 --> 01:12:51.387
Yes?

1062
01:12:52.014 --> 01:12:54.848
I have brought the <i>signorina</i> a present.

1063
01:12:54.934 --> 01:12:58.018
Why, Louisa, how nice of you. Thank you.

1064
01:12:58.562 --> 01:13:00.770
Why, Louisa!

1065
01:13:00.856 --> 01:13:02.768
Whatever made you do this?

1066
01:13:02.983 --> 01:13:06.693
Oh, he's a dear little thing.

1067
01:13:06.779 --> 01:13:09.943
We have worried about
your being alone, <i>signorina.</i>


1068
01:13:10.449 --> 01:13:12.941
Is he old enough to be
taken away from his mother?


1069
01:13:13.035 --> 01:13:16.244
Oh, yes. My sister
say the age is right.

1070
01:13:16.455 --> 01:13:20.199
She's... How do you say? Oh. 
A maiden lady.

1071
01:13:20.543 --> 01:13:23.456
Oh, she has many cats.
She would not be without one.


1072
01:13:23.754 --> 01:13:26.417
She talks to them from morning till night,

1073
01:13:26.757 --> 01:13:28.714
just as if they were people.

1074
01:13:29.760 --> 01:13:31.251
Does she, indeed?

1075
01:13:31.512 --> 01:13:33.754
I will bring you a
box to take it home in.

1076
01:13:34.723 --> 01:13:36.009
Thank you, Louisa.

1077
01:14:01.750 --> 01:14:03.161
Oh, no, my friend.

1078
01:14:06.922 --> 01:14:09.835
It hasn't come to that yet.
You're dear and small.


1079
01:14:10.509 --> 01:14:12.717
But I'm not going to turn to you
out of loneliness.


1080
01:14:17.349 --> 01:14:19.716
- Good morning, Miss Frances.
- Good morning.


1081
01:14:20.436 --> 01:14:22.928
- Where did that come from?
- Louisa gave it to me.


1082
01:14:23.063 --> 01:14:24.725
- Why?
- Why shouldn't she?


1083
01:14:24.815 --> 01:14:26.727
All the old maids in Rome have cats.

1084
01:14:26.817 --> 01:14:29.400
I've seen them in the evening,
sitting in the courtyard,


1085
01:14:29.486 --> 01:14:31.148
feeding them leftover spaghetti.

1086
01:14:31.864 --> 01:14:33.321
That sounds rather waspish.

1087
01:14:33.782 --> 01:14:35.023
Will you be able to type up

1088
01:14:35.117 --> 01:14:36.553
last night's pages for me this morning?

1089
01:14:36.577 --> 01:14:37.577
Yes.

1090
01:14:39.163 --> 01:14:41.325
- Is anything the matter?
- No.


1091
01:14:41.832 --> 01:14:43.869
You seem a bit curt this morning.

1092
01:14:44.126 --> 01:14:45.867
I've come to a reluctant decision.

1093
01:14:45.961 --> 01:14:47.247
I'll talk to you about it later.

1094
01:14:47.338 --> 01:14:48.545
Moral cowardice?

1095
01:14:49.048 --> 01:14:50.048
Very well.

1096
01:14:51.800 --> 01:14:53.792
I've decided I want
to go back to America.

1097
01:14:53.969 --> 01:14:55.426
Why?

1098
01:14:57.056 --> 01:14:58.342
Well, why shouldn't I?

1099
01:14:58.849 --> 01:15:00.715
Have I done anything to offend you?

1100
01:15:00.809 --> 01:15:01.809
No.

1101
01:15:02.228 --> 01:15:03.639
Then you have no possible reason

1102
01:15:03.729 --> 01:15:05.186
for wanting to go back to America.

1103
01:15:05.272 --> 01:15:07.639
I've been away for 15 years.
I want to go home.


1104
01:15:09.193 --> 01:15:11.230
- Would you like a holiday?
- No.


1105
01:15:11.695 --> 01:15:13.357
I'd like to finish this work for you.

1106
01:15:13.447 --> 01:15:15.926
Then I'd like to go to the consulate
and have my passport checked.


1107
01:15:15.950 --> 01:15:17.691
Now, see, here, this is nonsense.

1108
01:15:18.244 --> 01:15:20.827
What would you go back to?
You've no relations.


1109
01:15:21.622 --> 01:15:23.329
You'd live alone in a hotel room,

1110
01:15:23.415 --> 01:15:24.622
go to concerts on Sunday,

1111
01:15:24.708 --> 01:15:27.371
and work for some dull-witted
business executive.


1112
01:15:27.753 --> 01:15:29.369
What is attractive about that prospect?

1113
01:15:29.838 --> 01:15:30.838
Nothing.

1114
01:15:31.090 --> 01:15:33.878
- Nevertheless, I am going home.
- Oh.


1115
01:15:34.927 --> 01:15:36.168
What about me?

1116
01:15:36.887 --> 01:15:38.628
How am I going
to get along without you?

1117
01:15:38.806 --> 01:15:41.173
I've come to depend upon you.

1118
01:15:42.101 --> 01:15:45.014
I dislike change. 
I dislike new faces.

1119
01:15:45.771 --> 01:15:48.229
Friends of mine are going back,
and I want to go with them.


1120
01:15:49.149 --> 01:15:50.856
Maybe a hotel room alone in New York

1121
01:15:50.943 --> 01:15:52.229
will be hard to take.

1122
01:15:52.319 --> 01:15:55.858
But the prospect of becoming
a lonely old maid


1123
01:15:55.948 --> 01:15:59.532
with a life behind her,
a stranger in a foreign country,


1124
01:15:59.660 --> 01:16:01.276
isn't much to look forward to either.

1125
01:16:02.329 --> 01:16:03.615
And who knows?

1126
01:16:03.706 --> 01:16:06.995
Perhaps some nice old man
will want to marry me after all.


1127
01:16:09.586 --> 01:16:12.329
Have you ever considered
the possibility of marrying me?


1128
01:16:13.340 --> 01:16:15.172
Every woman considers that prospect

1129
01:16:15.301 --> 01:16:17.463
- with every man she meets.
- I'm quite serious.


1130
01:16:18.637 --> 01:16:20.879
I would guarantee you
the companionship you want.


1131
01:16:22.266 --> 01:16:24.098
You've certainly had time
to get used to me.


1132
01:16:24.184 --> 01:16:26.016
There would be no surprises
in store for you.


1133
01:16:26.103 --> 01:16:27.264
You know me too well.

1134
01:16:29.398 --> 01:16:32.891
I have enormous respect for you.
You add greatly to my comfort.


1135
01:16:33.193 --> 01:16:36.231
In fact, you're about
the only woman I know


1136
01:16:36.322 --> 01:16:38.234
to whom I would
make such a rash offer.

1137
01:16:41.994 --> 01:16:45.954
A marriage... based on friendship?

1138
01:16:46.999 --> 01:16:48.786
The Chinese marry as total strangers.

1139
01:16:48.876 --> 01:16:50.412
At least we met.

1140
01:16:51.712 --> 01:16:53.669
And suppose you should
wake up one bright morning


1141
01:16:53.756 --> 01:16:56.669
and discover that I was
desperately in love with you.


1142
01:16:57.676 --> 01:16:59.463
Wouldn't you find that rather disturbing?

1143
01:17:00.679 --> 01:17:03.467
The possibility of arousing
unsuspected passion at my age


1144
01:17:03.557 --> 01:17:06.095
would be not only disturbing,
but rather miraculous.


1145
01:17:08.312 --> 01:17:10.395
Would you care to think this
over for a day or two?


1146
01:17:12.691 --> 01:17:14.478
Are you sure you wouldn't?

1147
01:17:15.694 --> 01:17:19.187
The offer is quite genuine,
if a bit casual.


1148
01:17:20.908 --> 01:17:23.696
Then my acceptance is quite casual,

1149
01:17:23.827 --> 01:17:25.910
but a bit genuine.

1150
01:17:28.832 --> 01:17:29.913
Thank you.

1151
01:17:31.377 --> 01:17:33.710
I'm sure we'll be quite compatible.

1152
01:17:39.176 --> 01:17:41.213
<i>- Grazie,</i> Anna.
<i>- Prego, signorina.</i>


1153
01:17:50.854 --> 01:17:53.016
- Hi!
- Hi.


1154
01:17:53.524 --> 01:17:55.607
I'm just writing my folks
that I'm bringing you home


1155
01:17:55.692 --> 01:17:57.058
to stay a while with us.

1156
01:17:57.194 --> 01:17:58.901
But I'm not going home after all.

1157
01:17:59.655 --> 01:18:02.147
- But you said this morning...
- That was a hundred years ago.


1158
01:18:02.282 --> 01:18:04.899
I've decided to stay and get married.

1159
01:18:06.370 --> 01:18:08.828
- No!
- Isn't it ironic?


1160
01:18:09.540 --> 01:18:12.032
You're both so... so young and so lovely,

1161
01:18:12.251 --> 01:18:14.834
but of the three of us
I'm to be the bride.


1162
01:18:15.087 --> 01:18:16.453
- Shadwell?
- Who else?


1163
01:18:16.672 --> 01:18:18.584
No!

1164
01:18:18.715 --> 01:18:21.583
Oh, that's wonderful. 
How did it happen?

1165
01:18:21.718 --> 01:18:24.051
I don't know. I really don't know.

1166
01:18:24.304 --> 01:18:26.591
After being in love
with him for 15 years,

1167
01:18:26.682 --> 01:18:29.299
this silly man has
asked me to marry him.

1168
01:18:29.768 --> 01:18:32.181
Have you ever heard of anything so absurd?

1169
01:19:48.680 --> 01:19:51.263
- Good morning!
- Good morning, Louisa.


1170
01:19:51.600 --> 01:19:52.681
I brought these flowers.

1171
01:19:52.851 --> 01:19:54.342
Will you put them in a vase, please?

1172
01:19:54.686 --> 01:19:55.927
Is Mr. Shadwell up yet?

1173
01:19:56.188 --> 01:19:59.431
He's up and gone out. 
His door was open.

1174
01:19:59.525 --> 01:20:00.686
Have breakfast ready for him.

1175
01:20:00.776 --> 01:20:02.312
He's probably just gone for a walk.

1176
01:20:02.402 --> 01:20:03.938
Yes, <i>signorina</i>.

1177
01:20:04.071 --> 01:20:06.654
Oh, the <i>signorina</i> has a new dress!

1178
01:20:06.740 --> 01:20:08.777
It is very pretty.

1179
01:20:09.785 --> 01:20:11.993
Maybe a little too young.

1180
01:20:12.079 --> 01:20:15.538
Oh, it is spring, <i>signorina!</i>

1181
01:20:31.557 --> 01:20:32.843
You should have come to me

1182
01:20:32.933 --> 01:20:35.016
the first time this happened, my friend.

1183
01:20:35.519 --> 01:20:37.279
That would hardly
have been possible, Doctor.


1184
01:20:37.354 --> 01:20:39.061
I've had headaches all my life.

1185
01:20:40.065 --> 01:20:41.397
What do I do now?

1186
01:20:42.025 --> 01:20:43.812
I would advise you to go to America.

1187
01:20:43.902 --> 01:20:45.609
Dr. Weisner is there now.

1188
01:20:45.904 --> 01:20:47.645
He has managed, in these cases, to delay...

1189
01:20:47.739 --> 01:20:48.855
No, thank you.

1190
01:20:49.241 --> 01:20:51.233
I have no desire to prolong uncertainty.

1191
01:20:51.326 --> 01:20:52.942
Think about it a while.

1192
01:20:53.036 --> 01:20:54.743
I prefer to think how best to spend

1193
01:20:54.830 --> 01:20:56.287
this year allotted me.

1194
01:20:56.373 --> 01:20:58.911
One is not infallible in matters of time.

1195
01:20:59.918 --> 01:21:02.285
I don't think I should
work today, Dr. Martinelli.


1196
01:21:04.089 --> 01:21:07.548
There's never any preparation
for a death sentence, is there?


1197
01:21:07.926 --> 01:21:09.292
There is a lifetime.

1198
01:21:10.929 --> 01:21:13.342
That sounds like something
I might have written.


1199
01:21:13.807 --> 01:21:15.343
- Goodbye, Doctor.
- Goodbye.


1200
01:21:15.475 --> 01:21:16.556
Thank you.

1201
01:21:38.582 --> 01:21:40.022
<i>Come.</i>

1202
01:21:40.250 --> 01:21:42.687
Mr. Hoyt, there's a gentleman
here to see you about something.


1203
01:21:42.711 --> 01:21:43.997
Come in, sir.

1204
01:21:44.630 --> 01:21:47.088
- Thank you. Mr. Hoyt?
- That's me, sir.


1205
01:21:47.174 --> 01:21:49.402
- I'm John Frederick Shadwell.
- Here, won't you sit down?


1206
01:21:49.426 --> 01:21:50.426
Thank you.

1207
01:21:50.510 --> 01:21:52.342
That's interesting.
Same name as the writer.


1208
01:21:52.429 --> 01:21:53.636
I am the writer.

1209
01:21:53.722 --> 01:21:56.260
You are? Well, 
I'm one of your fans.

1210
01:21:56.350 --> 01:21:57.636
That's good to hear.

1211
01:21:57.726 --> 01:21:59.704
Looking for material
for a new novel, Mr. Shadwell?


1212
01:21:59.728 --> 01:22:00.935
Just information.

1213
01:22:01.146 --> 01:22:03.809
I want to know what must be done
to ship a body to America.


1214
01:22:04.066 --> 01:22:07.025
Well, you've come to the
right man. That's my specialty.


1215
01:22:07.110 --> 01:22:10.478
I handle former citizens.

1216
01:22:10.697 --> 01:22:13.155
- You seem to enjoy your work.
- Oh, I don't mind it.


1217
01:22:13.450 --> 01:22:15.362
Other vice-consuls
have clients who talk back.


1218
01:22:15.452 --> 01:22:16.693
Mine don't.

1219
01:22:16.787 --> 01:22:18.244
An obvious advantage.

1220
01:22:18.830 --> 01:22:20.867
Now then, I should like to know

1221
01:22:20.957 --> 01:22:23.574
the exact procedure
in having a body shipped home.


1222
01:22:23.669 --> 01:22:26.628
Well, first I must have a letter
making the request.


1223
01:22:26.713 --> 01:22:28.673
- Who writes the letter?
- That's a good question.


1224
01:22:28.757 --> 01:22:29.757
Who writes the letter?

1225
01:22:29.841 --> 01:22:31.548
The regulations say a close relative.

1226
01:22:32.177 --> 01:22:34.260
Then I must have a certificate
from the doctor,


1227
01:22:34.763 --> 01:22:37.255
a notarized report
for the American port of entry,


1228
01:22:37.516 --> 01:22:39.382
then permission from the city of Rome

1229
01:22:39.685 --> 01:22:41.096
and an export license.

1230
01:22:41.311 --> 01:22:42.552
It sounds quite complicated.

1231
01:22:42.771 --> 01:22:45.229
Dead or alive, there's still
a lot of red tape to it.


1232
01:22:45.565 --> 01:22:47.846
Well, thank you, Mr. Hoyt.
I shan't detain you any longer.


1233
01:22:47.901 --> 01:22:50.439
I assume that this is all just
for a new story of yours.


1234
01:22:50.821 --> 01:22:53.529
- There actually is no body.
- Oh, there's a body, all right.


1235
01:22:53.657 --> 01:22:56.195
- Is there? Whose?
- Mine.


1236
01:22:56.660 --> 01:22:57.821
Good day, sir.

1237
01:23:07.796 --> 01:23:09.788
You were up early this morning.

1238
01:23:10.340 --> 01:23:12.332
- You want your breakfast?
- Not at the moment.


1239
01:23:12.426 --> 01:23:14.509
- I finished these pages.
- Thank you.


1240
01:23:15.262 --> 01:23:16.628
Is anything the matter?

1241
01:23:17.931 --> 01:23:19.593
Miss Frances, I've had a very bad night.

1242
01:23:19.683 --> 01:23:21.094
Let me get you some coffee.

1243
01:23:21.184 --> 01:23:23.517
I was quite concerned over
this impulsive discussion we had


1244
01:23:23.603 --> 01:23:24.935
about marriage yesterday.

1245
01:23:25.313 --> 01:23:26.679
And this morning I realized

1246
01:23:26.773 --> 01:23:28.639
you could not possibly
have taken me seriously.


1247
01:23:28.734 --> 01:23:30.066
Why not?

1248
01:23:30.485 --> 01:23:32.021
Because you have too much self-respect

1249
01:23:32.112 --> 01:23:33.728
to consider seriously the offer of a man

1250
01:23:33.905 --> 01:23:35.862
who is interested only
in keeping his secretary.


1251
01:23:36.408 --> 01:23:37.608
You handled it extremely well,

1252
01:23:37.659 --> 01:23:40.026
and my admiration for your tact
is boundless.


1253
01:23:42.789 --> 01:23:44.621
Should I have reacted otherwise?

1254
01:23:44.708 --> 01:23:45.915
No.

1255
01:23:46.251 --> 01:23:48.851
But of course you should
go home, since it is so important to you.


1256
01:23:49.212 --> 01:23:51.875
In fact, the sooner you can
make arrangements,


1257
01:23:51.965 --> 01:23:53.547
the more convenient it'll be for me.

1258
01:23:53.842 --> 01:23:55.708
I want to go
to Capri for the summer,

1259
01:23:55.802 --> 01:23:57.589
and I'd like to get away
as soon as possible.


1260
01:23:57.971 --> 01:23:59.803
Aren't you going to finish the novel?

1261
01:24:00.182 --> 01:24:02.390
No, I seem to have lost interest
in it at the moment.


1262
01:24:03.226 --> 01:24:04.683
So, if you can book passage,

1263
01:24:04.770 --> 01:24:06.890
I promise not to place
any more embarrassing obstacles


1264
01:24:06.980 --> 01:24:08.266
in your path.

1265
01:24:10.025 --> 01:24:12.483
And you do forgive me
for my selfish panic?


1266
01:24:14.237 --> 01:24:15.353
Of course.

1267
01:26:04.389 --> 01:26:05.470
Yes, <i>signore?</i>

1268
01:26:06.141 --> 01:26:08.303
I should like
a bottle of scotch, some ice,


1269
01:26:08.393 --> 01:26:09.600
and a siphon of soda.

1270
01:26:10.437 --> 01:26:12.269
Sorry, sir. No bottles.

1271
01:26:12.689 --> 01:26:13.725
Why not?

1272
01:26:14.524 --> 01:26:16.641
Drinks, yes, but no bottles.

1273
01:26:17.694 --> 01:26:18.980
Very well, my friend.

1274
01:26:19.446 --> 01:26:22.484
Bring me six double scotches,
and line them up before me.


1275
01:26:23.366 --> 01:26:24.527
Very good, sir.

1276
01:26:42.761 --> 01:26:45.128
Are you, by any chance,
following me, Miss Frances?


1277
01:26:45.847 --> 01:26:47.713
- Yes.
- May I ask why?


1278
01:26:52.103 --> 01:26:55.346
Dr. Martinelli called after you left.

1279
01:26:56.650 --> 01:26:57.811
I see.

1280
01:26:58.860 --> 01:27:00.146
Is what you learned from him

1281
01:27:00.236 --> 01:27:02.569
the reason you changed your mind about us?

1282
01:27:03.990 --> 01:27:06.323
I suppose it's quite natural
for you to assume that.


1283
01:27:06.660 --> 01:27:08.617
But the truth is,
it had nothing to do with it.


1284
01:27:09.955 --> 01:27:11.867
It was one of those
unfortunate coincidences.


1285
01:27:13.333 --> 01:27:14.333
Oh.

1286
01:27:16.795 --> 01:27:19.162
He told me he suggested
you return to America.


1287
01:27:19.881 --> 01:27:20.881
You will go.

1288
01:27:21.174 --> 01:27:23.461
My dear Miss Frances, my life, my career

1289
01:27:23.593 --> 01:27:26.176
has been founded on
facing facts as I discover them,


1290
01:27:26.304 --> 01:27:27.761
never by wishful thinking.

1291
01:27:28.723 --> 01:27:31.010
I've no intention of seeking
a dubious year of grace.


1292
01:27:31.309 --> 01:27:32.891
But in an extra year's time

1293
01:27:33.144 --> 01:27:35.144
perhaps the doctors will
have discovered an answer.


1294
01:27:35.397 --> 01:27:37.013
Cures must be discovered sometime.

1295
01:27:37.232 --> 01:27:39.349
I shall accept my fate
with as much good grace


1296
01:27:39.442 --> 01:27:40.683
as I can muster.

1297
01:27:46.324 --> 01:27:47.906
What do you intend to do with those?

1298
01:27:48.076 --> 01:27:49.442
I intend to get drunk.

1299
01:27:49.536 --> 01:27:52.654
- Why?
- I've been cautious too long.


1300
01:28:00.630 --> 01:28:02.337
I'm sorry that you've learned about this.

1301
01:28:02.549 --> 01:28:03.507
But since you have,

1302
01:28:03.508 --> 01:28:04.999
you can be of great service to me.

1303
01:28:06.094 --> 01:28:08.427
I intend to spend the time
I have left here in Rome,


1304
01:28:08.638 --> 01:28:09.970
where I've lived most of my life.

1305
01:28:11.266 --> 01:28:13.599
But, oddly enough,
I want to be buried in America.


1306
01:28:15.020 --> 01:28:16.511
There are numerous details involved

1307
01:28:16.604 --> 01:28:18.641
that I should like to leave
in your capable hands.


1308
01:28:18.857 --> 01:28:20.064
Please don't.

1309
01:28:21.276 --> 01:28:23.518
I can't listen when you talk like this.

1310
01:28:24.529 --> 01:28:26.987
Then I shall turn the matter
over to someone less emotional.


1311
01:28:28.324 --> 01:28:29.860
Your greatest asset, Miss Frances,

1312
01:28:29.951 --> 01:28:31.738
has always been your detachment,

1313
01:28:31.828 --> 01:28:33.490
your freedom from sentimentality.

1314
01:28:34.581 --> 01:28:37.119
It'd be a pity if you shattered
that record at the end.


1315
01:28:39.919 --> 01:28:42.912
And now, if... 
If you don't mind, I...

1316
01:28:44.716 --> 01:28:46.173
I'd like to be left alone.

1317
01:29:03.193 --> 01:29:04.775
Does the <i>signora</i> care to order?

1318
01:29:05.528 --> 01:29:07.895
Yes. Bring me six double scotches, please.

1319
01:29:08.448 --> 01:29:10.735
- Six?
- Six.


1320
01:29:11.242 --> 01:29:12.574
Very good, <i>signora.</i>

1321
01:29:17.290 --> 01:29:19.998
May I ask what you intend to do
with six double scotches?


1322
01:29:20.085 --> 01:29:22.042
I intend to drink them.

1323
01:29:23.046 --> 01:29:25.288
May I suggest that
you'll live to regret it?


1324
01:29:25.381 --> 01:29:26.462
You may.

1325
01:29:29.344 --> 01:29:32.087
- But why six?
- I suspect a trick.


1326
01:29:32.680 --> 01:29:34.421
The Americans have thought of a scheme

1327
01:29:34.516 --> 01:29:36.098
to outwit us of our tips.

1328
01:29:36.392 --> 01:29:37.974
I must figure this out.

1329
01:29:38.394 --> 01:29:41.808
- How can one save on six drinks?
- Well...


1330
01:29:58.581 --> 01:29:59.788
That'll be all.

1331
01:30:12.720 --> 01:30:14.365
Shall I slap you on the back,
Miss Frances,


1332
01:30:14.389 --> 01:30:16.096
or shall I call
the waiter to do it?

1333
01:30:16.683 --> 01:30:17.844
Neither.

1334
01:30:19.435 --> 01:30:21.848
Shouldn't you be at your desk
attending to my work?


1335
01:30:23.481 --> 01:30:25.973
You've given up. 
Why shouldn't I?

1336
01:30:27.944 --> 01:30:30.231
I had no idea you went in
for this sort of thing.


1337
01:30:31.114 --> 01:30:32.400
I don't, as a rule.

1338
01:30:33.366 --> 01:30:34.823
To the Fountain of Trevi.

1339
01:30:35.368 --> 01:30:37.655
To the lovely, romantic Fountain of Trevi,

1340
01:30:37.745 --> 01:30:39.407
where hope can be had for a penny.

1341
01:30:39.497 --> 01:30:41.830
- People are looking at you.
- Well, high time.


1342
01:30:42.667 --> 01:30:45.831
- Do you really think you should?
- I really think I should.


1343
01:30:45.920 --> 01:30:47.286
- Why?
- Because...


1344
01:30:49.132 --> 01:30:50.668
my life is ending.

1345
01:31:03.605 --> 01:31:04.846
<i>Bambino.</i>

1346
01:31:06.107 --> 01:31:09.225
Don't hug the shore with it.
Be... Be reckless.


1347
01:31:09.527 --> 01:31:11.359
You've got your whole life ahead of you.

1348
01:31:12.238 --> 01:31:13.979
See what the world is like.

1349
01:31:17.285 --> 01:31:19.777
Oh! All right. 
All right, all right.

1350
01:31:26.127 --> 01:31:27.493
Here, take it.

1351
01:31:27.587 --> 01:31:29.499
Take it home
and play with it in the bathtub,


1352
01:31:29.631 --> 01:31:31.338
my brave little adventurer.

1353
01:31:34.260 --> 01:31:37.094
- What do you want?
- Really, Miss Frances.


1354
01:31:37.388 --> 01:31:40.005
Don't you think you're a bit
too old to go wading in public?


1355
01:31:40.099 --> 01:31:41.431
I'm not too old.

1356
01:31:41.517 --> 01:31:44.009
I'm not too old
to do anything I want to do.


1357
01:31:51.277 --> 01:31:52.518
Allow me to assist you

1358
01:31:52.612 --> 01:31:54.854
from that ludicrous and liquid posture.

1359
01:31:54.948 --> 01:31:56.564
Go away. Go away, please.

1360
01:32:00.662 --> 01:32:01.903
Give me your hand, then.

1361
01:32:18.346 --> 01:32:20.133
This'll make you feel much better.

1362
01:32:26.521 --> 01:32:28.103
I want my mother.

1363
01:32:28.439 --> 01:32:29.771
You haven't got a mother.

1364
01:32:31.109 --> 01:32:32.816
I haven't got anybody.

1365
01:32:33.778 --> 01:32:37.772
Nobody cares what happens to me.

1366
01:32:37.865 --> 01:32:40.107
Why didn't you let me drown?

1367
01:32:41.536 --> 01:32:44.370
A pity you didn't reveal your
capacity for vice earlier.


1368
01:32:45.707 --> 01:32:48.541
The years would've seemed
much shorter, and well-spent.


1369
01:32:50.044 --> 01:32:51.455
You needn't flatter me.

1370
01:32:51.546 --> 01:32:53.253
Miss Frances, please lie back.

1371
01:32:53.339 --> 01:32:55.205
You're going to feel dreadful later on.

1372
01:32:55.508 --> 01:32:57.670
I feel dreadful now.

1373
01:32:58.720 --> 01:33:00.586
- I've gotta get up.
- Why?


1374
01:33:00.972 --> 01:33:03.305
I've gotta help my friends. They love me.

1375
01:33:03.391 --> 01:33:05.678
- Yes. I know.
- They love me very much.


1376
01:33:05.768 --> 01:33:08.476
- Oh, poor Giorgio.
- Poor who?


1377
01:33:08.563 --> 01:33:10.646
Oh, don't pretend you don't know.

1378
01:33:10.773 --> 01:33:12.435
I've got to get to Mr. Burgoyne

1379
01:33:12.525 --> 01:33:15.188
and make him give Giorgio his job back.

1380
01:33:15.278 --> 01:33:18.646
Anita loves Giorgio,
and Giorgio loves Anita.


1381
01:33:18.740 --> 01:33:20.572
- Yes.
- But you wouldn't understand.


1382
01:33:21.534 --> 01:33:23.241
You hate everybody!

1383
01:33:23.411 --> 01:33:25.055
Well, I should certainly
hate to see you make


1384
01:33:25.079 --> 01:33:26.365
a daily habit of this.

1385
01:33:26.456 --> 01:33:27.947
And I've got to talk to Dino.

1386
01:33:28.041 --> 01:33:29.907
I want my Maria to have her prince.

1387
01:33:30.001 --> 01:33:33.711
Every girl should have a prince.
At least one.


1388
01:33:34.422 --> 01:33:35.754
My dear Miss Frances,

1389
01:33:35.840 --> 01:33:37.422
please try and get a little rest.

1390
01:33:37.884 --> 01:33:39.921
I'll do what I can later,
but in the meantime


1391
01:33:40.011 --> 01:33:41.502
it's important for you to sleep.

1392
01:33:42.472 --> 01:33:43.713
Sing to me.

1393
01:33:45.308 --> 01:33:47.675
The only song I know would
hardly be appropriate.


1394
01:33:47.769 --> 01:33:49.226
"The Star
-Spangled Banner."

1395
01:33:49.729 --> 01:33:51.470
You'd have to stand up, and...

1396
01:33:57.111 --> 01:33:58.943
Do you think you're
going to be all right?

1397
01:34:01.824 --> 01:34:02.905
Miss Frances?

1398
01:34:16.047 --> 01:34:17.208
Sleep.

1399
01:34:46.035 --> 01:34:48.948
<i>Signor</i> Shadwell.

1400
01:34:49.038 --> 01:34:50.324
Show him in.

1401
01:34:55.002 --> 01:34:56.538
- Well, John!
- Hello, Dino.


1402
01:34:57.088 --> 01:34:58.624
I come bearing presents.

1403
01:34:58.923 --> 01:35:01.040
You've always wanted
these first editions of mine.


1404
01:35:01.551 --> 01:35:02.861
I've decided to give them to you.

1405
01:35:02.885 --> 01:35:04.217
But I cannot accept.

1406
01:35:04.387 --> 01:35:05.844
But you will.

1407
01:35:05.972 --> 01:35:07.508
Well, I'm overwhelmed, John.

1408
01:35:07.807 --> 01:35:10.390
Why are you doing this?
Saves my packing them.


1409
01:35:11.185 --> 01:35:14.053
- I'm going away tomorrow.
- Oh. Off to Capri again, huh?


1410
01:35:14.147 --> 01:35:18.562
America. I'm going home
after 15 years. To be married.


1411
01:35:19.193 --> 01:35:21.856
- Miss Frances?
- How did you know?


1412
01:35:22.405 --> 01:35:25.819
For years, all of Rome has
known how Miss Frances felt.


1413
01:35:27.034 --> 01:35:28.195
Should I be surprised?

1414
01:35:28.327 --> 01:35:31.195
You should be ashamed.
You might have told me.


1415
01:35:31.289 --> 01:35:33.497
It is much better
that you waited, my friend.


1416
01:35:34.709 --> 01:35:37.827
No man should marry until
he is at least your age.


1417
01:35:38.463 --> 01:35:40.170
I shall accept that as a compliment.

1418
01:35:40.965 --> 01:35:42.581
- To your happiness.
- Thank you.


1419
01:35:45.428 --> 01:35:48.387
Now, at my age, you see,
we have no judgment.


1420
01:35:48.473 --> 01:35:52.092
- We feel too deeply.
- I can understand how you feel.


1421
01:35:53.019 --> 01:35:54.760
After all, you've just had a narrow escape

1422
01:35:54.854 --> 01:35:56.595
with that girl at the agency, haven't you?

1423
01:35:56.981 --> 01:35:59.769
- You know about this?
- Oh, all of Rome has known.


1424
01:36:00.234 --> 01:36:02.476
She almost tricked you
into marrying her, I understand.


1425
01:36:02.695 --> 01:36:04.652
Do you know what that girl did?

1426
01:36:04.822 --> 01:36:06.859
Kept a little black book
on you, I believe.


1427
01:36:06.949 --> 01:36:08.736
Listed all your likes and dislikes.

1428
01:36:08.826 --> 01:36:10.112
Even to the piccolo!

1429
01:36:10.369 --> 01:36:12.031
Only a woman could sink that low.

1430
01:36:12.121 --> 01:36:15.705
The duplicity
of this grasping girl!


1431
01:36:16.334 --> 01:36:18.041
Of course, we all grasp at happiness,

1432
01:36:18.127 --> 01:36:20.710
but there are such things as rules.

1433
01:36:20.796 --> 01:36:23.960
Exactly! I knew you would understand.

1434
01:36:24.050 --> 01:36:26.236
And you're quite right in
letting her go back to America


1435
01:36:26.260 --> 01:36:27.341
without a word.

1436
01:36:27.929 --> 01:36:29.295
She deserves to be unhappy.

1437
01:36:30.223 --> 01:36:31.839
She's going back to America?

1438
01:36:31.933 --> 01:36:36.018
Oh, she knows she did wrong,
so let her suffer for it.


1439
01:36:36.854 --> 01:36:39.938
You're well out of it, my boy.
You've acted like a man.


1440
01:36:42.652 --> 01:36:45.440
She deceived me. She... 
She lied to me.

1441
01:36:45.530 --> 01:36:47.567
Why can't women play the game properly?

1442
01:36:48.282 --> 01:36:49.864
Everyone knows that in love affairs

1443
01:36:49.992 --> 01:36:51.483
only the man has the right to lie.

1444
01:36:51.577 --> 01:36:52.658
Naturally.

1445
01:36:52.745 --> 01:36:54.782
She was very stupid to confess she lied.

1446
01:36:55.748 --> 01:36:58.616
She didn't have to. Very stupid.

1447
01:36:59.418 --> 01:37:02.377
See, to... To disillusion me so...

1448
01:37:02.463 --> 01:37:04.079
These girls in love never realize

1449
01:37:04.173 --> 01:37:05.914
they should be honestly dishonest

1450
01:37:06.008 --> 01:37:08.125
instead of being dishonestly honest.

1451
01:37:09.178 --> 01:37:12.387
- Do you know what I mean?
- Hmm? Oh, certainly.


1452
01:37:14.517 --> 01:37:16.349
So don't let anyone convince you

1453
01:37:16.435 --> 01:37:18.552
that you should be flattered
she went to such lengths


1454
01:37:18.646 --> 01:37:19.932
to capture your interest.

1455
01:37:20.064 --> 01:37:21.771
Don't worry. I won't.

1456
01:37:22.358 --> 01:37:25.101
Of course, I would be highly flattered.

1457
01:37:25.194 --> 01:37:27.481
But then, I'm an older man.

1458
01:37:27.905 --> 01:37:29.771
- Not much.
- Thank you.


1459
01:37:31.075 --> 01:37:33.988
Well, I'm glad that I leave you
in this happy frame of mind.


1460
01:37:34.870 --> 01:37:37.283
You know what you want, Dino.
Take care of yourself.


1461
01:37:38.291 --> 01:37:39.731
She'll be out of your life tomorrow,

1462
01:37:39.792 --> 01:37:41.499
and you'll never be bothered by her again.

1463
01:38:01.022 --> 01:38:02.809
- Home, <i>Signor</i> Shadwell?
- Not yet.


1464
01:38:02.898 --> 01:38:04.355
To the Burgoyne villa. And hurry.

1465
01:38:04.442 --> 01:38:05.442
<i>Si, signor.</i>

1466
01:38:21.876 --> 01:38:24.289
- I guess that's everything.
- Mm-hmm.


1467
01:38:25.796 --> 01:38:28.129
Well, goodbye, beautiful apartment.

1468
01:38:28.758 --> 01:38:30.499
Goodbye, romantic Rome.

1469
01:38:31.052 --> 01:38:32.259
Goodbye.

1470
01:38:44.440 --> 01:38:45.556
Hello?

1471
01:38:46.942 --> 01:38:48.228
Oh, hello.

1472
01:38:49.403 --> 01:38:50.610
Where?

1473
01:38:52.782 --> 01:38:54.148
Oh, all right, dear.

1474
01:38:55.117 --> 01:38:56.608
Uh-huh. We were just leaving.

1475
01:38:57.578 --> 01:38:58.578
Bye.

1476
01:38:59.872 --> 01:39:01.363
That was Frances.

1477
01:39:01.749 --> 01:39:04.162
She wants us to meet her
at the Fountain of Trevi.


1478
01:39:29.694 --> 01:39:32.653
Why do you suppose Frances
wanted to meet us here?


1479
01:39:32.738 --> 01:39:34.821
Oh, maybe she decided
to go back with us after all.


1480
01:39:34.907 --> 01:39:36.614
Well, she'd better hurry up.

1481
01:39:36.701 --> 01:39:38.533
Our train leaves in half an hour.

1482
01:39:39.328 --> 01:39:40.614
Why, it's empty.

1483
01:39:46.877 --> 01:39:50.791
<i>Signor, per che niente acqua?</i>

1484
01:39:50.965 --> 01:39:52.797
<i>- Lo puliscano.</i>
- Oh.


1485
01:39:53.134 --> 01:39:54.500
Why isn't there any water?

1486
01:39:54.760 --> 01:39:56.717
He says they're cleaning the pool.

1487
01:39:58.139 --> 01:40:01.803
Clean out the old dreams.
Make way for the new ones.


1488
01:40:02.476 --> 01:40:04.012
That fountain is a fraud.

1489
01:40:05.312 --> 01:40:06.769
When I tossed my coin in,

1490
01:40:07.106 --> 01:40:09.519
I wished I could stay
for a year in Rome.

1491
01:40:10.067 --> 01:40:12.730
And here I am, leaving after a month.

1492
01:40:12.820 --> 01:40:14.903
Well, I'm afraid there's no refund.

1493
01:40:15.448 --> 01:40:16.984
We can't wait around here much longer.

1494
01:40:17.074 --> 01:40:18.610
We're going to miss our train.

1495
01:40:20.119 --> 01:40:21.280
Oh, here she is.

1496
01:40:21.954 --> 01:40:24.367
Well, what happened to you?
We've been waiting hours.


1497
01:40:24.457 --> 01:40:27.074
You couldn't have.
I only phoned you an hour ago.


1498
01:40:27.501 --> 01:40:29.618
You were mighty mysterious.
What's this all about?


1499
01:40:29.879 --> 01:40:31.040
It's a surprise.

1500
01:40:36.510 --> 01:40:40.129
