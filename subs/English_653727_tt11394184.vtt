<i>I, Donald John Trump,

<i>Preserve, protect, and defend...</i>

12
00:00:31.084 --> 00:00:33.119
<i>The Constitution

13
00:00:33.286 --> 00:00:36.089
<i>The Constitution

<i>Immigrants in! 
Donald Trump out!</i>

15

<i>Immigrants in! 
Donald Trump out!</i>

16
00:00:54.207 --> 00:00:57.043
Always the most difficult
decision of the case,


17
00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:58.544
which tie to wear.

18
00:00:58.711 --> 00:01:01.647
And yet they're both
almost exactly the same.


19
00:01:03.016 --> 00:01:05.351
<i>Breaking right now,
President Donald Trump's</i>


20

executive order
to ban immigration


21
00:01:08.221 --> 00:01:10.190
<i>appears to have
taken effect already.</i>


22
00:01:10.323 --> 00:01:12.563
<i>Homeland security
officials started holding</i>


23
00:01:12.625 --> 00:01:14.227

24
00:01:14.394 --> 00:01:17.297
<i>from these seven Muslim

25
00:01:17.497 --> 00:01:19.297
<i>The president's order

26

<i>I'm establishing

27

28
00:01:27.607 --> 00:01:29.675
out of the United
States of America.


29
00:01:29.809 --> 00:01:31.411
We don't want 'em here.

30
00:01:32.846 --> 00:01:34.714
<i>All day, demonstrations
have been</i>


31
00:01:34.848 --> 00:01:37.150
growing outside at JFK airport.

32
00:01:37.283 --> 00:01:40.253
<i>The crowds there
chanting... Let them out!</i>


33
00:01:40.386 --> 00:01:42.688
<i>I was at home. 
I'm slowly seeing</i>

34
00:01:42.856 --> 00:01:44.757
<i>the news coverage
at the airport.</i>


35
00:01:44.891 --> 00:01:46.827
<i>More than 100 people detained</i>

36
00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:48.794
<i>or denied entry into
the United States</i>


37
00:01:48.962 --> 00:01:50.730
<i>at airports across the country.</i>

38
00:01:50.864 --> 00:01:53.466
<i>We've seen volunteer lawyers,</i>

39
00:01:53.699 --> 00:01:55.268
and they're literally
in the terminal,


40
00:01:55.401 --> 00:01:58.438
sitting on the ground on
laptops trying to write arguments,


41
00:01:58.571 --> 00:02:01.141
<i>write briefs to try and get
these individuals released.</i>


42
00:02:01.274 --> 00:02:03.109
<i>The Trump administration</i>

43
00:02:03.243 --> 00:02:05.811
<i>holding firm that the president
not only has the authority</i>


44
00:02:05.946 --> 00:02:08.081
<i>to pursue the order, but a duty.</i>

45
00:02:08.281 --> 00:02:10.316
<i>I said to my wife and kids,</i>

46
00:02:10.616 --> 00:02:14.154
<i>"I'm going out to court,"
still not really grasping</i>


47
00:02:14.287 --> 00:02:16.756
<i>the magnitude of

48
00:02:18.391 --> 00:02:21.928
<i>A‐C‐L‐U, we are here
we stand with you!</i>


49
00:02:22.095 --> 00:02:25.298
<i>A‐C‐L‐U, we are here
we stand with you!</i>


50
00:02:25.465 --> 00:02:28.301
<i>The ACLU have gone
to a federal courthouse</i>


51
00:02:28.468 --> 00:02:34.474
in Brooklyn to try to implement
a stay for the Executive Order.


52
00:02:34.941 --> 00:02:37.377
<i>And the judge came in
and said to the lawyers</i>


53
00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:40.180
<i>for the government,
"Can you tell me right now</i>"


54
00:02:40.346 --> 00:02:43.183
<i>that letting these people
come into the country</i>


55
00:02:43.316 --> 00:02:45.385
<i>"will threaten our
national security?"</i>


56
00:02:45.551 --> 00:02:49.022
<i>The government said, "Well,
the president believes so."</i>


57
00:02:49.189 --> 00:02:53.059
<i>Someone from the audience
came rushing up to me.</i>


58
00:02:53.393 --> 00:02:55.395
<i>And he handed me a
piece of paper and said,</i>


59
00:02:55.528 --> 00:02:58.798
<i>"My client is about to be
put on a plane in 20 minutes"</i>


60

<i>back to the Middle East.</i>

61
00:03:01.367 --> 00:03:03.937
<i>"And she will be
in serious danger."</i>


62
00:03:06.873 --> 00:03:08.484
<i>We're going to take you straight</i>

63
00:03:08.508 --> 00:03:11.277
<i>to the federal courthouse
there in Brooklyn, New York.</i>


64
00:03:11.444 --> 00:03:13.279
<i>We have not received any word,</i>

65
00:03:13.413 --> 00:03:15.533
<i>they're not letting anyone
else in, but the crowd here</i>


66
00:03:15.581 --> 00:03:17.984
<i>is sort of anxiously
awaiting word from inside</i>


67
00:03:18.151 --> 00:03:20.720
<i>as they all sort of press
their noses up to the glass</i>


68
00:03:20.887 --> 00:03:24.290
<i>and look inside to see when
the lawyers come back out.</i>


69
00:03:27.227 --> 00:03:29.595
Just leaving the courthouse...

70
00:03:29.896 --> 00:03:31.197
The stay was granted!

71
00:03:31.364 --> 00:03:34.935
The stay was granted!
The judge was amazing,


72
00:03:35.068 --> 00:03:39.639
giving love to the ACLU!
Thank you to the ACLU lawyers!


73
00:03:51.284 --> 00:03:53.429
<i>The immigration lawyers
are raising their fists</i>


74
00:03:53.453 --> 00:03:56.156
<i>in the air! They're
pumping their fists!</i>


75
00:04:01.661 --> 00:04:03.263
This is Lee Gelernt,

76
00:04:03.396 --> 00:04:05.598
deputy director of the
Immigrants' Rights Project,


77
00:04:05.765 --> 00:04:08.401
who argued in the
federal court just now.


78
00:04:08.568 --> 00:04:11.237
Lee, why don't you tell
us what the judge granted


79
00:04:11.371 --> 00:04:12.705
and what you asked for?

80
00:04:13.006 --> 00:04:16.542
The judge, in a nutshell, saw
through what the government


81
00:04:16.676 --> 00:04:18.845
was doing and gave
us what we wanted,


82
00:04:19.012 --> 00:04:21.982
which was to block
the Trump order.


83
00:04:22.115 --> 00:04:25.218
Everyone now who came is safe.

84
00:04:25.385 --> 00:04:28.488
The president could
not override the courts.


85
00:04:31.624 --> 00:04:36.997
Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!

86
00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:38.631
Thank you!

87
00:05:25.879 --> 00:05:27.580
Thank you all!

88

<i>The Supreme Court

100

Congratulations, Mr. President.

102
00:06:12.358 --> 00:06:15.495
Donald J. Trump is calling
for a total and complete


103
00:06:15.628 --> 00:06:19.132
shutdown of Muslims
entering the United States.


104
00:06:19.332 --> 00:06:20.692
We've never seen
anything like this


105
00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:22.135
in our 96‐year history.

106
00:06:22.302 --> 00:06:24.180
I would absolutely
bring back waterboarding


107
00:06:24.204 --> 00:06:25.915
and if it's gonna be
tougher than waterboarding,


108
00:06:25.939 --> 00:06:27.173
I would bring that back.

109
00:06:27.373 --> 00:06:28.818
Do you believe in
punishment for abortion.


110
00:06:28.842 --> 00:06:29.952
There has to be some
form of punishment.


111
00:06:29.976 --> 00:06:31.020
For the woman?

112
00:06:31.044 --> 00:06:32.378
Yeah. There has to be some form.

113
00:06:32.545 --> 00:06:35.215
I want surveillance of
certain mosques, okay?


114
00:06:35.348 --> 00:06:38.584
I will build a
great, great wall.

117

This is it.

118
00:08:49.382 --> 00:08:55.021
Uh, my name is handwritten
in pencil, uh, misspelled.


119
00:08:55.155 --> 00:08:57.323
So I can read parts of
the letter but I can't read


120
00:08:57.457 --> 00:09:00.626
all of it, because it has
identifying information.


121
00:09:01.094 --> 00:09:03.997
It says "Today is 12/17."

<i>I wanna know, like,
how he was appointed,</i>


135

136
00:10:14.367 --> 00:10:15.735
‐Things like that. ‐Yeah.

137
00:10:15.869 --> 00:10:17.346
And then it's like,
who has he talked to


138
00:10:17.370 --> 00:10:18.738
about abortion? VP? President?

139
00:10:18.905 --> 00:10:20.841
Why can't I ask that?
I can ask that, right?


140
00:10:20.974 --> 00:10:22.342
You can ask that. Yeah.

141
00:10:37.223 --> 00:10:38.500
Will the court reporter

142
00:10:38.524 --> 00:10:40.026
please swear in the witness?

143
00:10:40.226 --> 00:10:41.637
Do you swear to tell the truth,

144
00:10:41.661 --> 00:10:43.205
the whole truth, and
nothing but the truth


145

‐so help you God? ‐I do.

146
00:10:46.732 --> 00:10:50.170
This minor had
been raped, correct?


147
00:10:50.436 --> 00:10:52.873
Uh, well she claimed
to have been raped, yes.


148
00:10:53.006 --> 00:10:55.241
Do you have any
reason to disbelieve her?


149
00:10:55.375 --> 00:10:56.375
No.

150
00:10:56.476 --> 00:10:58.511
This minor had
thoughts of self‐harm?


151
00:10:58.744 --> 00:11:01.681
She expressed something
along those lines, yes.


152
00:11:02.148 --> 00:11:04.684
You also believe
that abortion is a sin.


153
00:11:05.418 --> 00:11:06.978
What does that have
to do with anything?


154
00:11:07.120 --> 00:11:09.755
It has to do with a lot. I
get to ask the questions.


155
00:11:09.890 --> 00:11:10.991
Mr. Tomlinson

156
00:11:11.124 --> 00:11:12.325
can object. So my question is,

157
00:11:12.458 --> 00:11:13.894
do you believe
abortion is a sin?


158
00:11:14.027 --> 00:11:15.561
I can object.

159
00:11:15.695 --> 00:11:17.895
He's testified in the past
that he does not let religion


160
00:11:17.964 --> 00:11:19.332
guide his job.

161
00:11:19.665 --> 00:11:21.543
I'm trying to understand
what the policy really is here


162
00:11:21.567 --> 00:11:23.036
with respect to
abortion requests.


163
00:11:23.169 --> 00:11:24.613
Okay, then let's
talk about the policy.


164
00:11:24.637 --> 00:11:26.077
Okay. I'm trying to understand

165
00:11:26.206 --> 00:11:27.974
whether there is
any abortion request


166
00:11:28.108 --> 00:11:30.510
that you are ever
going to approve.


167
00:11:30.643 --> 00:11:32.212
And the answer is
which I've answered


168
00:11:32.345 --> 00:11:34.047
is, "I don't know."

169
00:11:36.983 --> 00:11:41.187
Now for the first time
since <i>Roe v. Wade,</i>


170
00:11:41.521 --> 00:11:44.825
America has a
pro‐life president,


171
00:11:44.991 --> 00:11:47.193
a pro‐life vice president,

172
00:11:47.327 --> 00:11:50.063
a pro‐life House
of Representatives,


173
00:11:50.430 --> 00:11:55.768
<i>and 25 pro‐life
Republican state capitals.</i>


174
00:11:55.902 --> 00:11:57.703
<i>That is pretty good.</i>

175
00:11:58.304 --> 00:11:59.873
<i>That is pretty good.</i>

176
00:12:00.140 --> 00:12:01.207
<i>Wow!</i>

177
00:12:29.635 --> 00:12:32.005
<i>The first thing I knew
about the tweet was</i>


178
00:12:32.138 --> 00:12:35.775
I'd had a friend that texted me
that morning, and she was like,


179
00:12:35.909 --> 00:12:37.586
"Well whatever you
do, don't look at Twitter


180
00:12:37.610 --> 00:12:39.370
"and don't look at the
news." And I was like,


181
00:12:39.479 --> 00:12:40.799
"That's a weird
thing to tell me."


182
00:12:40.914 --> 00:12:42.315
And what am I gonna do?

183
00:12:42.448 --> 00:12:44.093
The first thing I'm gonna
do is look at the news.


184
00:12:44.117 --> 00:12:45.962
<i>The latest
presidential tweetstorm</i>


185
00:12:45.986 --> 00:12:48.154
<i>seemed to blindside
his own Pentagon,</i>


186
00:12:48.288 --> 00:12:50.090
<i>which promptly
referred all inquiries</i>


187
00:12:50.223 --> 00:12:51.624
<i>back to the White House.</i>

188
00:12:51.992 --> 00:12:53.970
<i>The Pentagon estimates
there are roughly</i>


189
00:12:53.994 --> 00:12:58.164
<i>2,500 transgender service
members on active duty.</i>


190
00:12:58.999 --> 00:13:01.334
<i>It was kind of shocking.
It was kind of just, like,</i>


191
00:13:01.467 --> 00:13:03.904
<i>a disconnect. Like, it
didn't feel real at first.</i>


192
00:13:04.237 --> 00:13:05.514
<i>Look, transgenderism</i>

193
00:13:05.538 --> 00:13:06.840
<i>is not an actual thing.</i>

194
00:13:07.140 --> 00:13:10.043
It's a mental dysfunction. We
have two genders right now...


195
00:13:10.176 --> 00:13:12.512
<i>I think I just kept
rolling over in my head,</i>


196
00:13:12.645 --> 00:13:17.117
you know, "What can I
do? What am I going to do?"


197
00:13:35.936 --> 00:13:37.803
One sec. Ab‐so‐lut...

198
00:13:37.971 --> 00:13:39.805
How do you spell "absolutely?"

199
00:13:40.006 --> 00:13:41.006
Ah!

200
00:13:41.741 --> 00:13:47.347
Absolutely give him my number.

201
00:13:49.682 --> 00:13:51.284
Because‐‐ Well, 
I'm trying to‐‐

202
00:13:51.451 --> 00:13:54.154
I'm trying to sign up this
one person for our lawsuit,


203
00:13:54.320 --> 00:13:58.024
but they need‐‐ Someone asked
if we could give him my number,


204
00:13:58.191 --> 00:14:02.295
and I said "Yes, absolutely,
give him my number."


205
00:14:02.695 --> 00:14:04.855
You can go over there. And
then, cause I'm about to get


206
00:14:04.898 --> 00:14:08.234
on my call and part of the key
is that you entertain yourself


207
00:14:08.401 --> 00:14:09.836
for a very short while.

208
00:14:10.003 --> 00:14:11.104
‐Okay ‐Okay.

209
00:14:11.271 --> 00:14:12.672
Hey, this is Chase
from the ACLU.


210
00:14:12.839 --> 00:14:14.774
Hey Taylor, this is
Chase from the ACLU.


211
00:14:14.941 --> 00:14:16.176
Is this Lynneth?

212
00:14:16.309 --> 00:14:17.878
Hey, is now still a
good time to chat?


213
00:14:18.011 --> 00:14:19.721
I was actually sitting here
waiting for the phone to ring.


214
00:14:19.745 --> 00:14:21.247
Oh, perfect! We're
in the process


215
00:14:21.414 --> 00:14:23.749
of trying to, to add
people to our lawsuits.


216
00:14:23.917 --> 00:14:25.551
If you're open to it,
it would be helpful


217
00:14:25.718 --> 00:14:27.318
if I could ask you a
bunch of questions‐‐


218
00:14:27.353 --> 00:14:29.073
Simran, you're literally
pulling my computer


219
00:14:29.122 --> 00:14:30.256
off the desk. Sorry.

220
00:14:30.423 --> 00:14:32.358
Yes, yes we are
working the weekends.


221
00:14:32.525 --> 00:14:34.260
We've been actually
working up a challenge


222
00:14:34.427 --> 00:14:36.429
to the military policy.
We really want to include


223
00:14:36.562 --> 00:14:38.202
lots of different people
who are harmed...


224
00:14:38.264 --> 00:14:39.866
‐Did you break a hanger? ‐Oops.

225
00:14:40.033 --> 00:14:42.802
We are trying to move quickly
and get a lot of information


226
00:14:42.969 --> 00:14:45.071
to challenge every
aspect of this.


227
00:14:45.705 --> 00:14:47.407
This is like my best suit.

228
00:14:47.540 --> 00:14:48.808
<i>And we wanna make sure</i>

229
00:14:48.942 --> 00:14:51.311
that nobody is being
blocked from enlisting.


230
00:14:51.477 --> 00:14:53.146
‐Wee, Uno! ‐Sim...

231
00:14:53.313 --> 00:14:55.882
‐Ah! ‐Alright talk to you soon.

232
00:14:56.049 --> 00:14:57.417
Okay. All right. Bye.

233
00:15:06.292 --> 00:15:08.594
<i>This is the
president's declaration</i>


234
00:15:08.728 --> 00:15:10.807
of open season on
trans people. ‐ Yeah.


235
00:15:10.831 --> 00:15:14.367
We need the court to act
and enjoin the government


236
00:15:14.534 --> 00:15:17.570
from doing anything
to enforce this directive.


237
00:15:23.877 --> 00:15:26.479
I really just wanted
a very simple thing.


238
00:15:27.580 --> 00:15:28.814
Double‐check her, 'cause...

239
00:15:28.949 --> 00:15:30.426
‐ Yeah, yeah.
Mm‐hmm. ‐ This one?


240
00:15:30.450 --> 00:15:31.861
Nine‐and‐a‐half years. ‐ Yeah!

241
00:15:31.885 --> 00:15:33.229
Staff sergeant. ‐ Yeah.

242
00:15:33.253 --> 00:15:34.620
So that's, like, straight army.

243
00:15:37.123 --> 00:15:39.792
‐Okay, so this person.
‐That is awesome.


244
00:15:40.160 --> 00:15:43.363
He's an active duty.
Lots of commendations.


245
00:15:43.529 --> 00:15:44.929
Obviously, someone

246
00:15:44.998 --> 00:15:47.467
the military has invested
a lot of resources in.


247
00:15:47.600 --> 00:15:50.270
There's a risk that they'll
be retaliated against


248
00:15:50.436 --> 00:15:51.504
in the military.

249
00:15:52.138 --> 00:15:54.474
I just don't want people
getting involved without


250
00:15:54.640 --> 00:15:56.409
fully understanding
what that would look like


251
00:15:56.576 --> 00:15:58.578
in the scope of their lives.

252
00:16:02.715 --> 00:16:04.684
ACLU, good morning.

253
00:16:04.885 --> 00:16:06.019
Is he in prison?

254
00:16:06.987 --> 00:16:10.090
Okay, so you're calling for help
for your friend who's in prison.


255
00:16:11.724 --> 00:16:13.994
No. But people are
cross‐trained to do our work...


256
00:16:14.127 --> 00:16:15.962
<i>Ever since Trump got elected,</i>

257
00:16:16.096 --> 00:16:18.731
<i>we basically slowly started
taking over the building.</i>


258
00:16:19.966 --> 00:16:22.402
We have a lot of
lawyers. I would say...


259
00:16:23.003 --> 00:16:25.939
like a hundred, but
I'm making that up.


260
00:16:26.672 --> 00:16:28.708
You can also sort of
gauge the hierarchy


261
00:16:28.842 --> 00:16:30.643
based on the
niceness of the offices.


262
00:16:30.810 --> 00:16:32.478
So here's the legal
director's office.


263
00:16:32.645 --> 00:16:35.949
There'll be a very distinct
contrast with my office.


264
00:16:36.850 --> 00:16:39.819
This is the famous
Brigitte Amiri's office.


265
00:16:39.986 --> 00:16:43.323
You can see how hard she
works by the stacks of papers.


266
00:16:45.691 --> 00:16:47.427
Human Rights is right here.

267
00:16:47.593 --> 00:16:49.029
The Brooklyn Bridge
Conference Room,


268
00:16:49.195 --> 00:16:50.496
which has the best view.

269
00:16:51.564 --> 00:16:52.866
Lee is not here.

270
00:16:53.766 --> 00:16:55.168
He's probably in court.

271
00:16:55.969 --> 00:16:59.439
This is‐‐ I am not the
best ACLU tour guide.


272
00:16:59.605 --> 00:17:02.342
Copy machines, which I
don't know how to work.


273
00:17:03.576 --> 00:17:05.111
Very artistic.

274
00:17:05.912 --> 00:17:09.282
This says, "the Womb Room".

275
00:17:09.782 --> 00:17:13.086
I don't really know
what goes on here.


276
00:17:14.654 --> 00:17:15.989
There's Jason.

277
00:17:16.189 --> 00:17:19.792
One of the few people I can
talk about sports with here.


278
00:17:20.726 --> 00:17:22.829
And now we've reached
the LGBT Project.


279
00:17:22.963 --> 00:17:24.164
Hey look! ‐Block: Hey!

280
00:17:24.297 --> 00:17:25.331
I'm giving a tour.

281
00:17:25.465 --> 00:17:26.632
Yeah? Yeah!

282
00:17:26.766 --> 00:17:27.766
Wow

283
00:17:28.068 --> 00:17:31.437
This is Dale's. He has
a very, like, oaky feeling.


284
00:17:31.571 --> 00:17:33.706
It's very Elk Moose Lodge.

285
00:17:34.640 --> 00:17:36.809
There are probably more
tattoos and piercings here


286
00:17:36.943 --> 00:17:39.379
at the ACLU than
there are at DOJ.


287
00:17:39.712 --> 00:17:41.723
The legal department is
divided into different projects.


288
00:17:41.747 --> 00:17:43.583
So, Women's Rights,
which was started


289
00:17:43.716 --> 00:17:44.985
by Ruth Bader Ginsberg.

290
00:17:45.118 --> 00:17:47.087
And then Speech
Privacy and Technology


291
00:17:47.220 --> 00:17:48.889
in that corner over there.

292
00:17:49.022 --> 00:17:50.623
I think they're the
ones who organize


293
00:17:50.756 --> 00:17:52.959
the Whisky Wednesdays,
which I'm too old for now.


294
00:17:53.126 --> 00:17:57.063
This is the intern den.

295
00:17:57.263 --> 00:18:01.034
Very intense and ambitious.
Very scary to walk in here.


296
00:18:02.402 --> 00:18:03.870
Chase is right here.

297
00:18:04.004 --> 00:18:08.208
I usually like, I always go
to see what's happening.


298
00:18:08.374 --> 00:18:09.775
He's definitely on the phone.

299
00:18:09.910 --> 00:18:11.845
This is an empty window office.

300
00:18:11.978 --> 00:18:15.181
Like, maybe I should
get to work in this office.


301
00:18:15.548 --> 00:18:18.384
I will say, it is pretty amazing
to come to work every day


302
00:18:18.518 --> 00:18:20.520
and be like, "Wow,
like, my colleagues


303
00:18:20.653 --> 00:18:22.755
are really, like, doing it!"

304
00:18:23.323 --> 00:18:24.925
They're such badasses.

305
00:18:39.272 --> 00:18:41.474
You'll hear testimony
from four of the plaintiffs


306
00:18:41.607 --> 00:18:42.675
in this case.

307
00:18:43.009 --> 00:18:44.810
All of them are
United States citizens.


308
00:18:44.945 --> 00:18:48.114
All of them are qualified to
vote in the state of Kansas.


309
00:18:53.819 --> 00:18:55.822
This law is like using...

310
00:18:57.090 --> 00:19:00.827
Enforcing this law is like
using a bazooka to kill a fly.


311
00:19:01.161 --> 00:19:04.530
Thousands of Kansas voters
have been the collateral damage.


312
00:19:07.968 --> 00:19:10.736
Election‐related litigation
tends to go a little bit faster,


313
00:19:10.871 --> 00:19:12.648
because we're usually
trying to get a court ruling


314
00:19:12.672 --> 00:19:13.940
before the next election.

315
00:19:14.074 --> 00:19:16.176
I like that. I like stuff
that's fast‐paced.


316
00:19:25.585 --> 00:19:28.221
<i>This case is all about
protecting the right to vote</i>


317
00:19:28.354 --> 00:19:31.324
<i>and disproving the lie
that there are hoards</i>


318
00:19:31.457 --> 00:19:34.995
<i>of non‐citizens infiltrating
American elections.</i>


319
00:19:35.128 --> 00:19:38.098
<i>I've been doing this
particular job for four years.</i>


320
00:19:38.231 --> 00:19:40.066
<i>We're gonna be
fighting state‐to‐state,</i>


321
00:19:40.266 --> 00:19:43.169
county‐to‐county against these
voter suppression measures.


322
00:19:44.004 --> 00:19:46.272
<i>Mr. Ho, do you think
that illegal aliens</i>


323
00:19:46.406 --> 00:19:47.874
should be allowed to vote?

324
00:19:48.008 --> 00:19:51.377
No. And I'm not aware
of any state that does so.


325
00:19:51.912 --> 00:19:53.813
<i>It's been pretty time‐consuming.</i>

326
00:19:53.947 --> 00:19:55.916
<i>I spend a decent amount
of time on the road.</i>


327
00:19:56.082 --> 00:19:58.751
Hey, sweetheart. Sorry that
I'm not gonna be home tonight.


328
00:20:01.154 --> 00:20:04.257
Kids! Goodnight!
I love you both.


329
00:20:04.390 --> 00:20:06.526
Yeah. Yeah.

330
00:20:16.469 --> 00:20:17.670
Daddy!

331
00:20:17.838 --> 00:20:20.640
Daddy! Will you
juggle, juggle, juggle?


332
00:20:20.773 --> 00:20:23.443
I want you to juggle!
Juggle, juggle!


333
00:20:23.609 --> 00:20:24.845
Juggle!

334
00:20:25.645 --> 00:20:26.646
Juggling balls.

335
00:20:26.779 --> 00:20:29.449
Hey! That's not how you juggle.

336
00:20:29.850 --> 00:20:31.627
Three balls. You need
three balls to juggle.


337
00:20:31.651 --> 00:20:32.685
Yeah. Juggling...

338
00:20:33.286 --> 00:20:35.721
<i>Before the election, I
mean, I was thinking,</i>


339
00:20:35.856 --> 00:20:37.599
<i>"We'll get through the
election and maybe see‐‐"</i>


340
00:20:37.623 --> 00:20:40.260
<i>Just poke around out
there and see if there may be</i>


341
00:20:40.393 --> 00:20:41.862
<i>things that will allow me</i>

342
00:20:41.995 --> 00:20:43.796
<i>"to spend a little more
time with my family."</i>


343
00:20:43.997 --> 00:20:44.998
<i>But...</i>

344
00:20:46.833 --> 00:20:49.769
the results of this election
made that idea just,


345
00:20:49.903 --> 00:20:51.423
I just tossed that
idea out the window.


346
00:20:51.537 --> 00:20:53.706
I mean, if I'm not gonna be

347
00:20:53.840 --> 00:20:56.977
a civil rights lawyer right
now, in this moment...


348
00:20:58.178 --> 00:20:59.445
when, right?

349
00:20:59.579 --> 00:21:00.780
So...

350
00:21:02.983 --> 00:21:05.685
They spend billions
of dollars on the census


351
00:21:05.818 --> 00:21:07.353
and you're not allowed to ask?

352
00:21:07.487 --> 00:21:09.755
You go knock on doors of houses.

353
00:21:09.890 --> 00:21:11.157
Check houses.

354
00:21:11.591 --> 00:21:13.169
You go through all this detail,
and you're not allowed to ask


355
00:21:13.193 --> 00:21:16.262
whether or not
somebody is a citizen?


356
00:21:22.002 --> 00:21:23.842
<i>The U. S. Department of Commerce</i>

357
00:21:23.870 --> 00:21:25.771
<i>announced Monday
that it plans to add</i>


358
00:21:25.906 --> 00:21:28.308
a question on citizenship status

359
00:21:28.441 --> 00:21:29.876
to the 2020 Census.

360
00:21:30.010 --> 00:21:31.845
<i>A seemingly simple question,</i>

361
00:21:31.978 --> 00:21:33.914
<i>"Are you a U. S. Citizen?"</i>

362
00:21:34.047 --> 00:21:35.327
<i>This is one of the few things</i>

363
00:21:35.415 --> 00:21:37.083
<i>that's written in
our Constitution</i>


364
00:21:37.217 --> 00:21:38.919
<i>that the federal
government has to do.</i>


365
00:21:39.052 --> 00:21:41.021
It's not just in
the Constitution,


366
00:21:41.154 --> 00:21:43.523
it's the sixth f‐‐‐ing sentence!

367
00:21:43.656 --> 00:21:45.625
The census is supposed to count

368
00:21:45.758 --> 00:21:47.493
every single person
in this country.


369
00:21:47.627 --> 00:21:49.662
Not just citizens. Every person.

370
00:21:49.795 --> 00:21:51.264
<i>How many seats a state gets in</i>

371
00:21:51.397 --> 00:21:52.866
the House of Representatives.

372
00:21:52.999 --> 00:21:54.811
<i>How many votes it gets
in the electoral college.</i>


373
00:21:54.835 --> 00:21:56.236
It's all based on the census.

374
00:21:56.369 --> 00:21:58.247
Challengers say the
question could lead


375
00:21:58.271 --> 00:22:00.540
to millions of people not
responding to the census


376
00:22:00.673 --> 00:22:03.944
and that could affect how
federal money is allocated


377
00:22:04.077 --> 00:22:08.014
and how many representatives
each state gets in Congress.


378
00:22:13.053 --> 00:22:14.687
This is Sarah. ‐Hey Sarah.

379
00:22:14.820 --> 00:22:16.589
You've got all of New York here.

380
00:22:16.722 --> 00:22:18.091
Okay. We anticipate

381
00:22:18.258 --> 00:22:19.735
they're gonna file something
in the Supreme Court


382
00:22:19.759 --> 00:22:21.361
and we're gonna
have to oppose that.


383
00:22:21.494 --> 00:22:23.729
And I like the idea of
doing a response here,


384
00:22:23.864 --> 00:22:25.344
obviously for the
substantive reasons,


385
00:22:25.398 --> 00:22:27.167
but also to jam
them up a little bit.


386
00:22:27.300 --> 00:22:28.935
The more we hit
them with right now,


387
00:22:29.169 --> 00:22:31.504
the harder it is for them to
respond and stay on course.


388
00:22:31.637 --> 00:22:32.973
<i>If we can get a brief...</i>

389
00:22:33.106 --> 00:22:34.706
<i>The government's
own estimate is that</i>


390
00:22:34.740 --> 00:22:36.652
<i>six‐and‐a‐half million
won't respond to the census</i>


391
00:22:36.676 --> 00:22:38.111
<i>if you add this question.</i>

392
00:22:38.378 --> 00:22:43.049
Six states would be at risk
of losing a seat in Congress.


393
00:22:44.117 --> 00:22:46.786
It's kind of difficult to
imagine higher stakes.


394
00:23:00.100 --> 00:23:04.104
Today, we're here to send
a message to the world


395
00:23:04.270 --> 00:23:07.773
that we are not going to let
the country be overwhelmed.


396
00:23:07.908 --> 00:23:10.310
People are not going to caravan

397
00:23:10.443 --> 00:23:13.079
or otherwise
stampede our border.


398
00:23:13.246 --> 00:23:15.849
If you cross the
border unlawfully


399
00:23:15.982 --> 00:23:17.717
then we will prosecute you.

400
00:23:17.851 --> 00:23:23.189
If you are smuggling a child,
then we will prosecute you,


401
00:23:23.323 --> 00:23:26.626
and that child may
be separated from you.


402
00:23:26.759 --> 00:23:28.829
These actions are necessary

403
00:23:28.962 --> 00:23:31.431
and they are made
even more necessary


404
00:23:31.764 --> 00:23:35.568
<i>by this massive increase
in illegal crossings...</i>


405
00:24:09.802 --> 00:24:12.873
I just drove down to the
San Diego/Mexico border


406
00:24:13.006 --> 00:24:16.476
to meet with this mother
who the government


407
00:24:16.609 --> 00:24:22.215
has separated her from her
child who's seven‐and‐a‐half.


408
00:24:22.348 --> 00:24:25.751
She escaped her country
where she was gonna be killed,


409
00:24:25.886 --> 00:24:29.055
and now is seeking asylum here.

410
00:24:31.224 --> 00:24:34.227
<i>The government took her
child and sent her to Chicago.</i>


411
00:24:34.360 --> 00:24:39.332
<i>The child is, of course,
scared out of her mind, crying.</i>


412
00:24:39.765 --> 00:24:41.201
<i>The little girl knows no one</i>

413
00:24:41.334 --> 00:24:43.636
<i>and she's just sitting
there by herself.</i>


414
00:24:44.304 --> 00:24:46.840
<i>I've come to talk to this
woman about whether</i>


415
00:24:46.973 --> 00:24:49.275
<i>she would like
us to bring a suit.</i>


416
00:26:00.313 --> 00:26:05.351
<i>That was a really rough meeting.</i>

417
00:26:06.019 --> 00:26:08.121
The mother would
like us to do...


418
00:26:09.189 --> 00:26:12.625
what we can to get her
daughter back to her.


419
00:26:13.359 --> 00:26:14.460
So...

420
00:26:14.928 --> 00:26:16.162
She's...

421
00:26:17.197 --> 00:26:19.599
She's distraught, you know?

422
00:26:20.100 --> 00:26:21.567
I don't know.

423
00:26:29.609 --> 00:26:33.046
<i>You'd mentioned that
there might be some</i>


424
00:26:33.179 --> 00:26:35.615
<i>pending legal action coming?</i>

425
00:26:35.748 --> 00:26:37.150
<i>I just wanted to see</i>

426
00:26:37.283 --> 00:26:38.627
<i>if there's anything
you can talk about.</i>


427
00:26:38.651 --> 00:26:41.521
Yeah, let's talk‐‐
Off the record?


428
00:26:41.654 --> 00:26:43.056
<i>Yeah.</i>

429
00:26:45.358 --> 00:26:48.995
So we are confidentially
filing a national class action


430
00:26:49.129 --> 00:26:50.396
in the next few hours.

431
00:26:51.031 --> 00:26:53.633
We think there's hundreds
of people all over the country


432
00:26:53.766 --> 00:26:55.435
who this is happening to.

433
00:26:58.204 --> 00:26:59.472
Mike? It's Lee Gelernt.

434
00:26:59.605 --> 00:27:01.842
Hey, Heidi, it's Lee.
Spencer, it's Lee.


435
00:27:01.975 --> 00:27:03.255
We gotta get
going on this stuff.


436
00:27:03.309 --> 00:27:04.720
You saw we got
another plaintiff, right?


437
00:27:04.744 --> 00:27:08.548
We're gonna do our
reply in three hours.


438
00:27:08.714 --> 00:27:11.985
Can I send you the complaint
and you start playing with that?


439
00:27:13.686 --> 00:27:15.231
You gotta make it clear to
the court what's happening.


440
00:27:15.255 --> 00:27:16.698
There is a habeas
position, but the motion


441
00:27:16.722 --> 00:27:18.258
to dismiss is
almost fully briefed,


442
00:27:18.391 --> 00:27:19.902
and now all of a
sudden they're telling us


443
00:27:19.926 --> 00:27:22.328
they may remove the
person while the stay motion


444
00:27:22.462 --> 00:27:24.965
is pending, which
is another 48 hours.


445
00:27:26.967 --> 00:27:28.234
Yeah, sure.

446
00:27:31.737 --> 00:27:33.439
Hold on one second, okay?

447
00:27:52.458 --> 00:27:54.961
My charger doesn't work.
Do you have an extra charger?


448
00:27:55.095 --> 00:27:56.496
‐Can you‐‐ You do? ‐Yeah.

449
00:27:56.629 --> 00:27:58.207
‐Can I borrow it? ‐Yeah,
but you have to plug it


450
00:27:58.231 --> 00:27:59.641
into your computer. I
don't have the wall...


451
00:27:59.665 --> 00:28:01.134
Can you show‐‐ How do I do that?

452
00:28:01.267 --> 00:28:03.003
It's just, you plug
it into a USB outlet


453
00:28:03.136 --> 00:28:04.838
in your tower, your
computer tower...


454
00:28:04.971 --> 00:28:06.172
But...

455
00:28:07.407 --> 00:28:09.175
You plug in that
side to the USB part


456
00:28:09.342 --> 00:28:10.977
‐and you plug in... ‐Down below?

457
00:28:11.111 --> 00:28:12.312
‐Yeah. ‐Yes.

458
00:28:14.114 --> 00:28:15.415
Um...

459
00:28:18.084 --> 00:28:19.419
Um...

460
00:28:32.866 --> 00:28:35.301
So, how many of
these separation cases


461
00:28:35.435 --> 00:28:37.337
do you think are out there?

462
00:28:38.238 --> 00:28:41.107
People on the ground
in the detention centers


463
00:28:41.241 --> 00:28:42.675
are saying hundreds.

464
00:28:43.309 --> 00:28:45.846
Hundreds of parents
have just lost their kids


465
00:28:45.979 --> 00:28:48.314
to being separated.

466
00:28:52.785 --> 00:28:54.520
<i>Why is the
government doing this?</i>


467
00:28:54.654 --> 00:28:56.054
<i>Because it's the law,</i>

468
00:28:56.156 --> 00:28:57.457
and that's what the law states.

469
00:28:57.590 --> 00:28:59.559
‐And the law... ‐There
is no law that requires


470
00:28:59.692 --> 00:29:01.212
families to be
separated at the border.


471
00:29:01.294 --> 00:29:02.771
This was the administration's
choice to move


472
00:29:02.795 --> 00:29:04.764
from civil matters on
immigration onto criminal


473
00:29:04.898 --> 00:29:06.266
and therefore to
separate families.


474
00:29:06.399 --> 00:29:07.679
Don't you have any empathy

475
00:29:07.800 --> 00:29:09.145
for what these people
are going through?


476
00:29:09.169 --> 00:29:10.436
They have less

477
00:29:10.570 --> 00:29:12.305
‐than you do! ‐Brian!
Guys! Settle down.


478
00:29:12.438 --> 00:29:14.016
‐ Sarah, seriously.
‐ I'm trying to be


479
00:29:14.040 --> 00:29:15.918
serious, but I'm not gonna
have you yell out of turn.


480
00:29:15.942 --> 00:29:17.786
‐Jill, please go on.
‐You're telling us it's a law,


481
00:29:17.810 --> 00:29:20.146
and you throw children
in cages. You're a parent.


482
00:29:20.280 --> 00:29:21.747
You're a parent
of young children!


483
00:29:21.882 --> 00:29:24.117
Don't you have any empathy
for what they go through?


484
00:29:24.250 --> 00:29:25.251
Jill, go ahead.

485
00:29:25.385 --> 00:29:26.652
Two questions for you.

486
00:29:26.887 --> 00:29:28.647
Firstly, does the
president really believe...


487
00:29:33.693 --> 00:29:35.962
So this is a Christian
television station.


488
00:29:36.496 --> 00:29:38.464
<i>We begin tonight with
an exclusive interview</i>


489
00:29:38.598 --> 00:29:40.198
<i>with the Trump
official who tried to stop</i>


490
00:29:40.233 --> 00:29:42.668
<i>a detained immigrant
from getting an abortion.</i>


491
00:29:42.836 --> 00:29:44.670
<i>I know you personally
have written about</i>


492
00:29:44.804 --> 00:29:46.816
<i>your pro‐life views and
are a Catholic father of six.</i>


493
00:29:46.840 --> 00:29:48.141
<i>Yeah.</i>

494
00:29:48.474 --> 00:29:49.852
<i>You are robbing young
women of their ability</i>


495
00:29:49.876 --> 00:29:51.744
to make decisions
about their pregnancies


496
00:29:51.878 --> 00:29:53.880
and forcing them to
carry their pregnancies


497
00:29:54.014 --> 00:29:55.949
to term against their
will because you think


498
00:29:56.082 --> 00:29:57.550
you know what's best for them.

499
00:29:57.683 --> 00:30:01.321
There isn't anything more
scary or more patriarchal.


500
00:30:01.454 --> 00:30:03.456
<i>We need to do everything
that we can to protect</i>


501
00:30:03.589 --> 00:30:04.869
<i>the dignity of
life of human life</i>


502
00:30:04.958 --> 00:30:06.893
<i>from conception
to natural death.</i>


503
00:30:17.470 --> 00:30:19.081
<i>If the court doesn't
intervene quickly,</i>


504
00:30:19.105 --> 00:30:21.107
<i>she will be forced to
carry her pregnancy</i>


505
00:30:21.241 --> 00:30:22.708
<i>to term against her will.</i>

506
00:30:30.183 --> 00:30:33.453
<i>Time is a big factor. We're
racing against the clock.</i>


507
00:30:58.644 --> 00:31:00.713
Alright this sentence
doesn't sound right to me.


508
00:31:00.881 --> 00:31:04.117
"Although the government
has asserted that on..."


509
00:31:04.250 --> 00:31:05.351
Start all over again.

510
00:31:05.485 --> 00:31:06.552
"That it believed."

511
00:31:06.686 --> 00:31:08.054
That it believed. ‐Yeah.

512
00:31:08.188 --> 00:31:09.455
Yep. Okay. Now I'm too tired.

513
00:31:11.657 --> 00:31:14.727
<i>It really feels like a canary
in the coalmine moment.</i>


514
00:31:15.061 --> 00:31:17.263
<i>If we lose this
case, I don't know</i>


515
00:31:17.397 --> 00:31:19.332
<i>what</i> Roe vs. 
Wade <i>means.</i>

516
00:31:43.156 --> 00:31:44.958
<i>The government has argued</i>

517
00:31:45.091 --> 00:31:47.493
<i>we want to favor
life over abortion.</i>


518
00:31:47.627 --> 00:31:50.196
<i>What is your response
to their suggestion</i>


519
00:31:50.330 --> 00:31:53.499
<i>that they don't have to be
complicit in the abortion?</i>


520
00:31:53.766 --> 00:31:55.468
<i>Your Honor, 
I would say that</i>

521
00:31:55.601 --> 00:31:57.938
<i>they have admitted in the
context of ICE detention</i>


522
00:31:58.071 --> 00:32:00.306
<i>that they will and
do facilitate abortion.</i>


523
00:32:00.440 --> 00:32:02.876
<i>Suppose she had been
detained at the border,</i>


524
00:32:03.009 --> 00:32:04.510
but not in the United States.

525
00:32:04.644 --> 00:32:06.989
She would have been sent back,
presumably, to her home country


526
00:32:07.013 --> 00:32:09.515
<i>and the government's
theory of this is that</i>


527
00:32:09.649 --> 00:32:12.886
<i>that's the same position
she would be in now.</i>


528
00:32:13.286 --> 00:32:15.355
<i>But that's not the
position she's in now.</i>


529
00:32:15.488 --> 00:32:16.732
<i>Your Honor,
deportation proceedings</i>


530
00:32:16.756 --> 00:32:18.224
<i>have not begun against her.</i>

531
00:32:18.358 --> 00:32:20.393
<i>Due process clause of the
Fifth Amendment applies</i>


532
00:32:20.526 --> 00:32:22.095
<i>to all persons in
the United States.</i>


533
00:32:22.228 --> 00:32:24.430
<i>There is no reason why
her immigration status</i>


534
00:32:24.564 --> 00:32:26.075
<i>should diminish her
constitutional right</i>


535
00:32:26.099 --> 00:32:27.533
<i>to access abortion.</i>

536
00:32:27.733 --> 00:32:30.403
<i>The government may not
ban abortion for anyone.</i>


537
00:33:00.433 --> 00:33:03.036
It's good, it's
good. All good stuff.


538
00:33:04.204 --> 00:33:05.438
Thanks, everybody!

539
00:33:05.571 --> 00:33:08.074
Yep, you guys are
amazing. Thank you. Bye.


540
00:33:12.245 --> 00:33:14.680
I'm not sure that there's
much I can say on the train.


541
00:33:14.814 --> 00:33:17.783
But, um, things
are gonna work out.


542
00:33:18.318 --> 00:33:21.754
She will be able to get the
care she needs tomorrow.


543
00:33:23.189 --> 00:33:24.357
Look at that headline.

544
00:33:24.490 --> 00:33:25.926
And how happy
does that make you?


545
00:33:26.492 --> 00:33:28.694
Ah! So happy.

546
00:33:29.930 --> 00:33:32.532
I have to edit it, but this
is the headline. Right?


547
00:33:32.665 --> 00:33:34.067
Good headline.

548
00:33:35.735 --> 00:33:37.279
Guess what I'm getting? ‐ Wine!

549
00:33:37.303 --> 00:33:41.107
Train wine! Who
wants some train wine?


550
00:33:41.241 --> 00:33:42.442
Oh, yeah.

551
00:33:42.909 --> 00:33:44.310
Cheers! Woohoo!

552
00:33:44.444 --> 00:33:45.846
Train wine.

553
00:34:16.542 --> 00:34:19.512
<i>We know there are other
young women out there.</i>


554
00:34:20.146 --> 00:34:21.915
<i>We know the
policy is still in place.</i>


555
00:34:22.048 --> 00:34:24.550
<i>We're asking to
proceed as a class action</i>


556
00:34:24.750 --> 00:34:26.786
so we don't have to
go running into court


557
00:34:26.920 --> 00:34:29.055
for each young woman
once we find them.


558
00:34:37.230 --> 00:34:40.466
I actually started,
um, cross‐stitching.


559
00:34:40.666 --> 00:34:41.767
Yeah, no I...

560
00:34:41.902 --> 00:34:43.203
Like, you know,
"home sweet home"


561
00:34:43.336 --> 00:34:44.670
Right.

562
00:34:44.871 --> 00:34:46.639
It's "CrossFit", is what
people are saying.


563
00:34:46.772 --> 00:34:48.341
Wait, did you get,
like, confused?


564
00:34:48.474 --> 00:34:50.634
I wish I was doing‐‐
‐Cause it doesn't, like,


565
00:34:50.676 --> 00:34:52.378
‐keep you in shape.
‐Yeah, no I'm not‐‐


566
00:34:52.512 --> 00:34:53.679
I wish I was doing CrossFit,

567
00:34:53.813 --> 00:34:55.281
but instead, I'm
doing needlepoint.


568
00:35:01.321 --> 00:35:02.388
<i>Hi, I'm Chase.</i>

569
00:35:02.555 --> 00:35:03.866
Nice to meet you in person.

570
00:35:03.890 --> 00:35:05.067
‐ Good to meet you. ‐ I'm Josh.

571
00:35:05.091 --> 00:35:06.626
Great to meet you in person too.

572
00:35:06.792 --> 00:35:10.363
I joined May 23rd, 2006.

573
00:35:10.496 --> 00:35:12.833
So it'll be over 12 years now.

574
00:35:13.666 --> 00:35:15.335
That was a flag that

575
00:35:15.468 --> 00:35:16.903
when I was in
Afghanistan, I flew.


576
00:35:17.170 --> 00:35:19.339
Yeah, the one below,
it's like my farewell plaque


577
00:35:19.472 --> 00:35:21.374
from when I was in Korea.

578
00:35:21.507 --> 00:35:22.808
These three are my dad.

579
00:35:22.943 --> 00:35:25.611
That I think was just
his basic training photo.


580
00:35:25.745 --> 00:35:27.547
He was a Morse code operator.

581
00:35:28.348 --> 00:35:30.350
How would you
express your feelings


582
00:35:30.483 --> 00:35:33.419
about your interaction
with other service members


583
00:35:33.553 --> 00:35:36.756
and whether there's ever
been any problem or discomfort?


584
00:35:37.023 --> 00:35:39.759
I have not had one person
be anything but supportive.


585
00:35:39.893 --> 00:35:41.895
Like, if there's anybody
here that has an issue


586
00:35:42.028 --> 00:35:44.197
with me being trans,
I'm not aware of it.


587
00:35:44.330 --> 00:35:46.799
The military is very
much a family for me.


588
00:35:47.033 --> 00:35:48.869
That's kind of being
taken away from me.


589
00:35:49.002 --> 00:35:51.337
You know, I have
people tell me all the time,


590
00:35:51.537 --> 00:35:53.206
"Military service
is a privilege.


591
00:35:53.339 --> 00:35:54.707
It's not a right."

592
00:35:54.841 --> 00:35:57.277
I would argue that by
virtue of my performance,


593
00:35:57.410 --> 00:36:00.246
by virtue of my ability,
and by virtue of the fact


594
00:36:00.380 --> 00:36:03.016
that I am qualified
to be in the military


595
00:36:03.149 --> 00:36:07.253
and have been for 11
years, that I should stay.


596
00:36:17.563 --> 00:36:20.166
<i>The people that have
been pushing for this ban</i>


597
00:36:20.400 --> 00:36:24.337
<i>object to the existence
of trans people.</i>


598
00:36:25.005 --> 00:36:29.109
<i>They wanna kick them out
of jobs and out of schools.</i>


599
00:36:29.642 --> 00:36:33.746
<i>Basically, they wanna erase
trans people from public life.</i>


600
00:36:39.953 --> 00:36:42.889
<i>If your whole body and identity</i>

601
00:36:43.023 --> 00:36:46.860
is sort of the contested
site of the conversation,


602
00:36:46.993 --> 00:36:49.595
it's really hard to
then put it out there.


603
00:36:49.795 --> 00:36:51.173
It's easier for me
to, like, watch Josh


604
00:36:51.197 --> 00:36:53.266
do an argument
and do a great job


605
00:36:53.466 --> 00:36:55.068
because Josh knows how to do it.

606
00:36:55.201 --> 00:36:58.504
And if we get a good
ruling, like, then...


607
00:36:58.738 --> 00:37:00.040
I will have been brilliant.

608
00:37:00.173 --> 00:37:03.643
And if, like, we
get a bad ruling...


609
00:37:04.144 --> 00:37:07.047
The fate of the trans
community is all your fault.


610
00:37:07.180 --> 00:37:08.214
Yeah.

611
00:37:08.348 --> 00:37:09.788
And it's just gonna be you?

612
00:37:09.883 --> 00:37:13.686
Uh, we're not sure
yet. Um... Probably.


613
00:37:13.819 --> 00:37:15.755
I guess we'll see.

614
00:37:15.889 --> 00:37:19.492
It is complicated,
as a cis person,


615
00:37:19.625 --> 00:37:21.962
to be, like, doing the argument.

616
00:37:22.162 --> 00:37:24.831
Like, there's so much
responsibility you have


617
00:37:24.965 --> 00:37:27.133
to the people whose
stories you're telling.


618
00:37:27.267 --> 00:37:31.371
You're the only trans
person on the team


619
00:37:31.504 --> 00:37:34.307
except for our clients, um...

620
00:37:34.507 --> 00:37:37.010
and that's complicated.

621
00:37:37.143 --> 00:37:41.247
What do you feel about
doing the argument yourself?


622
00:37:41.814 --> 00:37:43.383
Well I mean, I just...

623
00:37:43.516 --> 00:37:45.952
I'm not the right person to
do this argument, you know?


624
00:37:46.086 --> 00:37:48.488
I think it's tricky, cause
you have to build up‐‐


625
00:37:48.621 --> 00:37:49.823
Like, this is a huge case.

626
00:37:49.956 --> 00:37:51.757
Like, I don't have
enough experience.


627
00:37:51.892 --> 00:37:53.803
I mean, when I became a
lawyer, there weren't that many


628
00:37:53.827 --> 00:37:55.337
trans lawyers, and so,
then I had to be doing


629
00:37:55.361 --> 00:37:57.697
a lot of different types of
things, and it didn't include


630
00:37:57.831 --> 00:38:01.367
just honing my litigation
skills on random shit.


631
00:38:02.002 --> 00:38:03.512
'Cause there was
just no time for that.


632
00:38:03.536 --> 00:38:05.376
It was like, "Go do this
legislative advocacy,"


633
00:38:05.471 --> 00:38:09.042
"Go learn how to be on TV,"
"Go do this," "Go do that."


634
00:38:11.344 --> 00:38:12.378
"Go...

635
00:38:13.513 --> 00:38:16.950
train the ACLU on what
it means to be trans."


636
00:38:29.896 --> 00:38:31.616
"We all know what
birth control means


637
00:38:31.697 --> 00:38:32.866
to the ACLU.

638
00:38:33.133 --> 00:38:34.933
It is the bashing of the
heads of the innocent


639
00:38:35.035 --> 00:38:38.038
and the spilling of their
brains on the sidewalk."


640
00:38:39.105 --> 00:38:41.741
"A liberal immigrant
dumb-ass like you


641

642

"Illegal immigrants do
not have rights, jackass."

He could probably do without
eight exclamation marks.


645
00:38:53.053 --> 00:38:55.721
Probably five would
have been sufficient.


646

"Hey, faggot.
You're a disgusting,


647

of decency in your own life."


650
00:39:04.630 --> 00:39:06.366
"Go home, immigrant pig."

651
00:39:06.499 --> 00:39:09.069

<i>I can see that by your
photograph and your voice.</i>


657
00:39:30.756 --> 00:39:33.293
You're a f‐‐‐ing piece of s‐‐‐.

658
00:39:37.197 --> 00:39:40.934
Yeah. If you don't look
at the negative stuff,


659
00:39:41.067 --> 00:39:43.703
then you're just sort
of in your own bubble.


660
00:39:43.970 --> 00:39:45.839
You know, I don't
wanna run from this.


661
00:39:57.817 --> 00:40:01.988
"Are you a citizen of the

00:40:02.288 --> 00:40:03.389
"Oh, gee!

I'm sorry, I just can't
answer that question."

in fall of 2017,

672
00:40:31.918 --> 00:40:35.655
your staff hand‐delivered
a secret memo


673
00:40:35.788 --> 00:40:39.893
about the citizenship question
to the Department of Justice.


674
00:40:40.126 --> 00:40:44.597
Did the secret memo describe
the real reason you wanted

to add the citizenship question?

676
00:40:47.133 --> 00:40:49.502
I don't believe there's
anything in evidence


677
00:40:49.635 --> 00:40:53.439
that my staff delivered
a message of that sort.

why are you doing it?

688
00:41:32.578 --> 00:41:34.523
If you really want accurate
citizenship information,


689
00:41:34.547 --> 00:41:36.883
you'd go to the social

The fact that
you're not doing that


691
00:41:39.185 --> 00:41:40.854
suggests that it's a pretext.

<i>Now, we think we
know what that goal is.</i>


696
00:41:49.996 --> 00:41:51.497
It's to scare immigrant

reduce the participation
of noncitizens

noncitizens in their families

"Equal Justice Under Law."

703
00:42:12.886 --> 00:42:15.621
Mr. Secretary, you
lied to Congress,


704
00:42:15.755 --> 00:42:20.093
you mislead the American
people, and you are complicit


705
00:42:20.226 --> 00:42:23.596
in the Trump administration's
intent to suppress


706
00:42:23.729 --> 00:42:29.202
the growing political power
of the nonwhite population.


707
00:42:29.502 --> 00:42:33.673
You have already done
great harm to Census 2020


708
00:42:33.907 --> 00:42:36.476
and you should, in
my opinion, resign.


709
00:42:37.143 --> 00:42:39.479
Is there a question
in that, sir?


710
00:42:40.680 --> 00:42:44.017
I still don't see
what it is that the...


711
00:42:44.150 --> 00:42:45.986
people need to be afraid of.

712
00:42:46.119 --> 00:42:47.599
You're being asked
"Are you a citizen?


713
00:42:47.687 --> 00:42:49.189
Are you not a citizen?"

714
00:42:49.355 --> 00:42:51.555

thing for the government to ask.

Don't bother trying to
win the pretext argument

740
00:44:16.609 --> 00:44:20.280
The secretary ignored that
advice from the Census Bureau,


741
00:44:20.413 --> 00:44:22.248
"and that was unlawful."

772
00:46:17.898 --> 00:46:19.632
<i>They're bonafide asylum seekers.</i>

773
00:46:19.765 --> 00:46:21.868
<i>They're still having their
children ripped away.</i>

<i>Like it or not, these
aren't our kids.</i>


775

<i>It's not like he's doing
this to the people of Idaho</i>

<i>The medical evidence

<i>that we may be doing
permanent trauma to these kids.</i>


781

In your hometown, in Guatemala

782
00:47:08.014 --> 00:47:10.783
were there other families
that had their children


783
00:47:10.917 --> 00:47:11.917
taken away?

784
00:48:48.481 --> 00:48:50.216
The government has a fair amount

785
00:48:50.350 --> 00:48:51.885
of technical arguments.

786
00:48:52.552 --> 00:48:55.889
<i>My job is gonna be
to make sure the horror</i>


787

<i>of what's going on really
stays front and center.</i>


788
00:49:02.762 --> 00:49:05.398
For me, you know, just
thinking about my own kids,


789
00:49:05.531 --> 00:49:09.269
it's just... It's
inconceivable...


790
00:49:10.803 --> 00:49:12.538
that this could be happening,

791
00:49:12.672 --> 00:49:16.776
and that I don't‐‐ You know,
I'd be going out of my mind.


792
00:49:28.889 --> 00:49:31.624
<i>There's a kind of
cyclical nature to the work</i>


793

<i>of a civil liberties

794
00:49:41.401 --> 00:49:42.936

<i>You're not gonna

797

<i>Our first same‐sex

798

799
00:49:54.780 --> 00:49:56.060
and said "We wanna get married."

800
00:49:56.116 --> 00:49:59.652
<i>For 44 years, we stayed on that.</i>

801
00:50:01.454 --> 00:50:04.958
We defend civil
liberties for all.


802
00:50:06.326 --> 00:50:09.029
<i>And not everybody
at the ACLU agrees.</i>


803
00:50:12.833 --> 00:50:15.501
<i>Not everybody in the
United States agrees.</i>


804

<i>The promise of a

<i>uh, exercise the right.</i>

806
00:50:23.877 --> 00:50:26.746
<i>It's not a right for the
people you agree with,</i>

00:50:26.980 --> 00:50:28.882
<i>it's a right for everybody.</i>

808
00:50:35.856 --> 00:50:37.490
You're gonna get

when you get up there.

810
00:50:39.025 --> 00:50:41.327
Get your torches lit
and get in your columns.


811
00:50:42.028 --> 00:50:44.030
Uh, white nationalists
are getting ready to march


812
00:50:44.164 --> 00:50:45.531
in Charlottesville, Virginia

813
00:50:45.698 --> 00:50:48.601
<i>Jews! Will not!

<i>Jews! Will not!

<i>Jews! Will not! 
Replace us!</i>

818
00:51:01.481 --> 00:51:04.584
If the ACLU was
not successful today


819
00:51:04.750 --> 00:51:07.253
and the Charlottesville City
Government was allowed


820
00:51:07.420 --> 00:51:09.990
to deny us our constitutional
First Amendment rights,


821
00:51:10.123 --> 00:51:13.026
we might be in a different
situation than we are today.


822
00:51:13.927 --> 00:51:16.496
It's a melding of white
nationalists, Klan,


823
00:51:16.662 --> 00:51:19.199
fascists all mixing
together and uniting.


824
00:51:19.632 --> 00:51:21.401
Uh‐oh. It looks
like a small group


825
00:51:21.701 --> 00:51:23.336
of counter‐demonstrators
has surrounded


826
00:51:23.469 --> 00:51:24.938
the Robert E. Lee Memorial.

827
00:51:25.238 --> 00:51:28.341
<i>No Nazis! No KKK!
No fascist USA!</i>


828
00:51:28.608 --> 00:51:30.043
Move, bitch!

829
00:51:31.477 --> 00:51:33.046
<i>White lives matter!</i>

830
00:51:33.313 --> 00:51:34.714
<i>White lives matter!</i>

831
00:51:34.848 --> 00:51:37.450
<i>White lives matter!
White lives matter!</i>


832
00:51:42.688 --> 00:51:44.057
Hail Trump!

833
00:51:44.190 --> 00:51:46.827
We are determined to
take our country back.


834
00:51:47.093 --> 00:51:50.130
We're gonna fulfill the
promises of Donald Trump


835
00:52:01.875 --> 00:52:03.543
Oh, my God! Oh, my God.

836
00:52:03.709 --> 00:52:05.979
Oh my God. Holy...

837
00:52:06.980 --> 00:52:08.681
Go, go, go.

838
00:52:12.318 --> 00:52:14.087
Holy shit!

839
00:52:14.220 --> 00:52:17.991
<i>Holy shit! Holy...</i>

840
00:52:25.665 --> 00:52:27.733
I think there were all
kinds of discussions,


841
00:52:27.868 --> 00:52:30.403
both formal and
informal that went on


842
00:52:30.937 --> 00:52:33.573
within the organization
after this happened.


843
00:52:34.340 --> 00:52:37.110
There were people that
were badly, badly hurt,


844
00:52:37.277 --> 00:52:39.312
and there was
somebody who was killed.


845
00:52:40.013 --> 00:52:42.748
And our name was
attached to the event.


846
00:52:43.616 --> 00:52:47.420
The ACLU was not responsible
for Heather Heyer's death.


847
00:52:48.054 --> 00:52:50.523
<i>But we were not a
random organization</i>


848
00:52:50.656 --> 00:52:53.126
<i>just out there watching
what happened.</i>


849
00:52:53.860 --> 00:52:56.162
We have a policy
of defending those


850
00:52:56.296 --> 00:52:58.965
who, with whom we disagree,
including white supremacists,


851
00:52:59.099 --> 00:53:02.235
including the alt‐right, and
we will continue to do so.


852
00:53:11.611 --> 00:53:14.180
<i>The calculus isn't
just as simple as,</i>


853
00:53:14.314 --> 00:53:16.883
<i>"Oh this is a First
Amendment issue."</i>


854
00:53:20.386 --> 00:53:22.322
<i>This ain't Skokie, Illinois.</i>

855
00:53:23.389 --> 00:53:27.894
<i>This isn't a handful
of neo‐Nazis</i>


856
00:53:28.094 --> 00:53:30.196
<i>who don't have weapons...</i>

857
00:53:31.031 --> 00:53:32.765
and who don't have a president

858
00:53:32.899 --> 00:53:36.569
in the White House
spewing openly racist stuff.


859
00:53:37.770 --> 00:53:41.741
<i>You had people, very
fine people, on both sides.</i>


860
00:53:42.175 --> 00:53:43.809
You had a lot of
people in that group


861
00:53:43.944 --> 00:53:45.912
that were there to
innocently protest


862
00:53:46.079 --> 00:53:47.413
and very legally protest‐‐

863
00:53:47.580 --> 00:53:49.282
because, I don't
know if you know,


864
00:53:49.482 --> 00:53:50.616
they had a permit.

865
00:53:50.783 --> 00:53:52.285
The other group
didn't have a permit.


866
00:53:52.418 --> 00:53:53.719
Well I would say, you know,

867
00:53:53.854 --> 00:53:55.364
the fact that President
Trump is in office


868
00:53:55.388 --> 00:53:58.992
and that we have someone
who is a racist in power


869
00:53:59.125 --> 00:54:02.128
only underscores why
you would not want to give


870
00:54:02.262 --> 00:54:06.699
government officials the power
to silence those whose views


871
00:54:06.833 --> 00:54:07.968
they disagree with.

872
00:54:08.168 --> 00:54:09.769
President Trump
is not gonna silence


873
00:54:09.903 --> 00:54:11.104
the white supremacists.

874
00:54:11.404 --> 00:54:13.506
Who's he gonna silence
if you give him that power?


875
00:54:13.840 --> 00:54:16.709
I disagree with the decision.

876
00:54:16.877 --> 00:54:19.512
That doesn't mean I
don't respect the decision.


877
00:54:19.679 --> 00:54:21.314
I just disagree with it.

878
00:54:23.216 --> 00:54:26.019
<i>A horrific scene in
Charlottesville, Virginia.</i>


879
00:54:26.152 --> 00:54:29.322
<i>A white nationalist rally
that descended into deadly</i>


880
00:54:29.489 --> 00:54:30.590
<i>violence and chaos.</i>

881
00:54:30.857 --> 00:54:32.492
<i>The images just coming in.</i>

882
00:54:32.625 --> 00:54:35.595
<i>A car plowing into a crowd

883
00:54:35.761 --> 00:54:37.430
<i>against those
white nationalists.</i>


884
00:54:37.597 --> 00:54:42.135
<i>A 32‐year‐old woman killed.
A number of severe injuries,</i>


885
00:54:42.302 --> 00:54:43.369
<i>many life‐threatening.</i>

886
00:54:43.536 --> 00:54:45.405
<i>A driver has been
taken into custody.</i>


887
00:54:45.571 --> 00:54:47.473
<i>On the streets of
Charlottesville today,</i>


888
00:54:47.640 --> 00:54:49.209
<i>the hate boiling over.</i>

889
00:54:49.409 --> 00:54:51.912
<i>White supremacists
and counter‐protestors</i>

00:54:53.847 --> 00:54:55.348
<i>Confederate flags on...</i>

892

<i>People say "Why don't
you go work at a law firm</i>"

894
00:55:20.140 --> 00:55:22.675
<i>"on your shoulders?"</i>

895
00:55:25.278 --> 00:55:27.848
<i>It takes its toll on your

896
00:55:28.014 --> 00:55:29.850
<i>and on your family.</i>

897
00:55:31.717 --> 00:55:33.186
Did you wear your cape all day?

898
00:55:34.787 --> 00:55:37.457
<i>We begin with a
decision that will impact</i>


899
00:55:37.590 --> 00:55:39.292
<i>the nation for decades.</i>

900
00:55:40.026 --> 00:55:42.162
<i>Justice Anthony Kennedy
announced Wednesday</i>


901
00:55:42.328 --> 00:55:44.197
<i>he will retire after
three decades</i>


902
00:55:44.464 --> 00:55:45.798
<i>on the Supreme Court.</i>

903
00:55:45.932 --> 00:55:47.267
<i>The 81 year old...</i>

904
00:55:47.500 --> 00:55:49.836
I got a New York
Times alert on my phone.


905
00:55:50.070 --> 00:55:53.706
And my daughter heard me gasp.

906
00:55:53.840 --> 00:55:56.442
And said "Mommy! What's
wrong? What's wrong?"


907
00:55:56.576 --> 00:56:01.147
And I said, "Justice Kennedy
announced his retirement."


908
00:56:01.281 --> 00:56:03.716
And she said, "Well,
what does that mean?"


909
00:56:04.184 --> 00:56:07.988
And I said, "Mommy's
job just got a lot harder."


910
00:56:08.221 --> 00:56:12.092
His decision to retire from
the court is game‐changing


911
00:56:12.358 --> 00:56:15.461
on critical cases
involving civil liberties,


912
00:56:15.695 --> 00:56:20.266
LGBT rights, the death
penalty, affirmative action.


913
00:56:20.500 --> 00:56:22.802
<i>Do you think that
Kennedy's retirement</i>


914
00:56:22.936 --> 00:56:25.038
putsRoe v. Wade <i>in question?</i>

915
00:56:25.205 --> 00:56:27.740
It absolutely calls
it into question.


916
00:56:27.908 --> 00:56:29.809
You have four
justices on the Court


917
00:56:29.943 --> 00:56:33.313
who are very hostile
to abortion rights.


918
00:56:33.546 --> 00:56:35.815
Any of the debate
around the nominee


919
00:56:35.982 --> 00:56:39.119
has everything to do
with whom is nominated.


920
00:56:39.285 --> 00:56:42.322
And Judge Kavanaugh
is on the shortlist for


921
00:56:42.455 --> 00:56:43.723
Trump's appointments.

922
00:56:44.124 --> 00:56:46.559
<i>I argued in front of him
on the emergency appeal</i>


923
00:56:46.692 --> 00:56:48.061
<i>for Jane Doe.</i>

924
00:56:48.328 --> 00:56:49.972
<i>He punted and said,
"I'll allow the government</i>


925
00:56:49.996 --> 00:56:51.497
<i>more time with the case."</i>

926
00:56:52.899 --> 00:56:54.334
<i>Under Texas law,</i>

927
00:56:54.467 --> 00:56:57.470
<i>she was eligible
for an abortion.</i>


928
00:56:57.670 --> 00:57:03.343
The pregnancy was four
weeks further when you upheld...


929
00:57:04.277 --> 00:57:07.680
the Trump administration
in blocking her efforts


930
00:57:07.813 --> 00:57:09.883
to terminate her pregnancy.

931
00:57:10.450 --> 00:57:12.618
<i>The decision of that
panel was overruled.</i>


932
00:57:12.818 --> 00:57:15.021
Has Kavanaugh never ruled

933
00:57:15.155 --> 00:57:17.557
‐on any other abortion?
‐Only Jane Doe.


934
00:57:17.690 --> 00:57:19.730
Only Jane Doe, that
was the only one ever?


935
00:57:19.893 --> 00:57:21.337
Only abortion case.
He said something like,


936
00:57:21.361 --> 00:57:22.896
"Roe v. Wade is precedent

937
00:57:23.229 --> 00:57:24.865
and I would be
bound by precedent."


938
00:57:24.998 --> 00:57:27.000
Doesn't apply when he's
in the Supreme Court.


939
00:57:27.167 --> 00:57:28.734
Once he gets to the high court‐‐

940
00:57:28.902 --> 00:57:30.182
Then he can create
new precedent.


941
00:57:30.336 --> 00:57:32.572
Exactly! He gets to
make the precedent.


942
00:57:32.939 --> 00:57:34.740
I wanna talk about a list.

943
00:57:35.308 --> 00:57:38.278
Uh, it's the list that
Donald Trump circulated


944
00:57:38.444 --> 00:57:42.582
of his potential
Supreme Court nominees.


945
00:57:42.815 --> 00:57:45.318
His litmus test for that list...

946
00:57:45.952 --> 00:57:49.189
was that a justice
that he'd nominate


947
00:57:49.322 --> 00:57:53.493
would have to automatically
overturn Roe v. Wade, correct?


948
00:57:54.594 --> 00:57:56.229
I'm not gonna comment

949
00:57:56.362 --> 00:57:58.074
on what he said. Whatever
he had said publicly‐‐


950
00:57:58.098 --> 00:57:59.866
‐Well he said it ‐Yeah.

951
00:58:05.571 --> 00:58:08.541
<i>Earlier this week, we got
multiple anonymous tips</i>


952
00:58:08.708 --> 00:58:11.077
<i>that there were two
more Jane Does.</i>


953
00:58:11.244 --> 00:58:13.746
<i>It just‐‐ It never ends.</i>

954
00:58:13.880 --> 00:58:15.315
No. It doesn't.

955
00:58:15.448 --> 00:58:17.750
<i>It's shocking that the
federal government</i>


956
00:58:17.984 --> 00:58:19.619
continues to do
this despite the fact


957
00:58:19.752 --> 00:58:22.288
that we had a clear
victory for Jane Doe.


958
00:58:22.488 --> 00:58:24.891
All right, so you have the Word
version and the PDF version.


959
00:58:25.025 --> 00:58:26.335
Do you wanna open it

960
00:58:26.359 --> 00:58:28.094
and we'll scroll through it.

961
00:58:28.228 --> 00:58:30.230
<i>Late last night, we filed
our motion to proceed</i>


962
00:58:30.396 --> 00:58:33.066
as a class action
on behalf of anyone


963
00:58:33.233 --> 00:58:37.303
who is pregnant
in O. R. R. custody.


964
00:58:39.605 --> 00:58:42.508
<i>We are scrambling
as quickly as we can.</i>


965
00:58:44.911 --> 00:58:48.348
<i>I've always believed that
the Trump administration</i>


966
00:58:48.481 --> 00:58:53.153
<i>would try to do to everyone
what they did to Jane Doe.</i>


967
00:59:03.463 --> 00:59:06.299
Were those actual
screen grabs of tweets?


968
00:59:06.432 --> 00:59:07.968
Yeah we're putting
the screen grabs‐‐


969
00:59:08.101 --> 00:59:09.402
This is the new way to litigate.

970
00:59:09.602 --> 00:59:11.522
So do you fix the typos
or just leave them as‐is?


971
00:59:11.571 --> 00:59:13.974
No‐‐ Yeah, we
just leave the typos.


972
00:59:14.107 --> 00:59:15.441
You're dialed‐in right now.

973
00:59:15.608 --> 00:59:16.809
No, I'm not. I'm just‐‐

974
00:59:16.943 --> 00:59:18.778
I just have to send
one thing. Um...


975
00:59:18.912 --> 00:59:24.417
Because the court has to assign
it to a division in the morning


976
00:59:24.584 --> 00:59:26.252
‐and... ‐I also feel
like me perusing...


977
00:59:26.419 --> 00:59:27.854
‐Yeah. ‐...what
you're working on


978
00:59:28.021 --> 00:59:29.301
and acting like I understand it.

979
00:59:29.355 --> 00:59:30.790
And also, you
shouldn't look at it.


980
00:59:30.957 --> 00:59:33.326
‐Okay. ‐Even though
Dad already tried to.


981
00:59:33.459 --> 00:59:35.996
I actually had a
moment where I was like,


982
00:59:36.162 --> 00:59:39.532
"Is dad gonna try to take
these and do something?


983
00:59:39.665 --> 00:59:42.869
‐ Like, send them to
Brietbart?" ‐ ACLU strikes again!


984
00:59:45.071 --> 00:59:47.107
When I served, my
units were super diverse.


985
00:59:47.273 --> 00:59:49.142
We had people who
were not American citizens


986
00:59:49.275 --> 00:59:51.287
who specifically joined
to be a part of the country.


987
00:59:51.311 --> 00:59:53.546
‐ Do you want water?
‐ Yeah, I'll take it.


988
00:59:53.947 --> 00:59:58.184
It does represent what I believe
much of what's best of America.


989
00:59:58.318 --> 01:00:00.286
Chase and I don't
always agree politically,


990
01:00:00.420 --> 01:00:03.489
and all of that aside,
a broad‐brush ban


991
01:00:03.656 --> 01:00:05.591
on a certain segment
of the population


992
01:00:05.758 --> 01:00:07.727
not being allowed
to serve their country,


993
01:00:07.861 --> 01:00:10.163
which to me is so antithetical
to everything the military


994
01:00:10.296 --> 01:00:12.332
is supposed to represent.

995
01:00:28.448 --> 01:00:29.582
Open Word.

996
01:00:33.920 --> 01:00:35.221
Open Word!

997
01:00:36.122 --> 01:00:37.523
Start listening.

998
01:00:38.624 --> 01:00:41.694
President Trump has
issued a formal memorandum


999
01:00:41.862 --> 01:00:46.099
with three binding directives
that explicitly overturn


1000
01:00:46.366 --> 01:00:49.502
pre‐existing military
policy. Period.


1001
01:00:51.437 --> 01:00:53.439
In all three cases, the
president didn't wait


1002
01:00:53.573 --> 01:00:55.408
for some further
study to be completed.


1003
01:00:55.541 --> 01:00:58.578
He changed the policy
first and then ordered


1004
01:00:58.711 --> 01:01:01.781
additional study
after the fact. Period.


1005
01:01:01.948 --> 01:01:03.449
New paragraph.

1006
01:01:05.919 --> 01:01:07.120
No.

1007
01:01:14.227 --> 01:01:15.829
Stop listening.

1008
01:01:22.836 --> 01:01:25.138
Can you explain what a moot is?

1009
01:01:25.271 --> 01:01:28.674
A moot is a practice
oral argument session.


1010
01:01:29.042 --> 01:01:31.711
Colleagues and sometimes
friends from outside the organization,


1011
01:01:31.878 --> 01:01:34.714
co‐counsel, play the role
of judges, and just pepper


1012
01:01:34.848 --> 01:01:37.050
that person with questions.

1013
01:01:38.151 --> 01:01:40.253
There's no moot pump‐up music?

1014
01:01:40.753 --> 01:01:42.488
No, not for moots.

1015
01:01:42.622 --> 01:01:45.125
For the actual
argument itself, I think.


1016
01:01:45.992 --> 01:01:51.231
Although I have been playing
it on repeat in my head, um,


1017
01:01:51.397 --> 01:01:53.533
Tom Petty's "I Won't Back Down".

1018
01:01:55.668 --> 01:01:56.669
Shall we?

1019
01:01:58.839 --> 01:02:01.274
Kendall was supposed
to find a podium.


1020
01:02:20.226 --> 01:02:21.962
We put the brief
in three days ago,


1021
01:02:22.095 --> 01:02:24.297
so, just... Uh...

1022
01:02:25.899 --> 01:02:27.167
I'll do my best.

1023
01:02:27.633 --> 01:02:29.669
<i>Okay, counselor, what relief</i>

1024
01:02:29.836 --> 01:02:31.071
<i>are you asking for?</i>

1025
01:02:31.237 --> 01:02:32.915
Your Honor, we are
asking that the children


1026
01:02:32.939 --> 01:02:36.709
who have been separated already
be reunited with their parents.


1027
01:02:36.877 --> 01:02:40.080
The courts have held
that an agency must fully


1028
01:02:40.213 --> 01:02:43.483
and accurately set
forth the methods


1029
01:02:43.616 --> 01:02:45.785
by which it has chosen to act.

1030
01:02:45.919 --> 01:02:47.787
The president said
we need to ban this


1031
01:02:47.921 --> 01:02:50.056
because of the tremendous cost.

1032
01:02:50.190 --> 01:02:51.791
The amount of
money the military pays


1033
01:02:51.958 --> 01:02:54.527
to treat erectile dysfunction
dwarfs the amount of money


1034
01:02:54.727 --> 01:02:56.796
it pays to treat
gender dysphoria.


1035
01:02:56.963 --> 01:02:58.764
The government has
taken the position that


1036
01:02:58.899 --> 01:03:01.301
only sponsorship or
voluntary departure


1037
01:03:01.434 --> 01:03:03.403
are the mechanisms
for accessing abortion.


1038
01:03:03.536 --> 01:03:06.940
But those, uh, mechanisms
are completely outside


1039
01:03:07.073 --> 01:03:08.308
of the minors' control.

1040
01:03:08.441 --> 01:03:10.543
One thing I think that bears,

1041
01:03:10.710 --> 01:03:15.381
uh, mentioning, that's
not in, um, our, uh...


1042
01:03:16.116 --> 01:03:18.251
co‐plaintiff's brief...

1043
01:03:18.384 --> 01:03:21.221
That's not how I wanna
put this. Um, what?


1044
01:03:22.255 --> 01:03:23.489
I'm having some issues today.

1045
01:03:23.656 --> 01:03:25.058
The government says that all

1046
01:03:25.225 --> 01:03:27.193
of its detention choices
are discretionary


1047
01:03:27.360 --> 01:03:29.262
and that therefore,
I can't review it.


1048
01:03:29.429 --> 01:03:31.631
Right, Your Honor, but
that's wrong, Your Honor.


1049
01:03:31.797 --> 01:03:34.935
Due process always
constrains discretion.


1050
01:03:35.068 --> 01:03:37.337
Six states face a
substantial risk of losing


1051
01:03:37.503 --> 01:03:41.241
a seat in Congress.
California, New York, Texas,


1052
01:03:41.374 --> 01:03:43.343
Florida, Arizona, and Illinois.

1053
01:03:43.476 --> 01:03:45.846
We've got somebody
who identifies as male


1054
01:03:45.979 --> 01:03:47.380
and has female genitalia.

1055
01:03:47.680 --> 01:03:50.316
Why does the military
have to deal with all that?


1056
01:03:50.984 --> 01:03:54.888
We have to make him
feel like he cannot sign off


1057
01:03:55.021 --> 01:03:58.758
on these little kids
sitting all by themselves.


1058
01:03:58.892 --> 01:04:02.195
He has to have a mental
picture of these kids.


1059
01:04:02.362 --> 01:04:03.897
Do you think that you have a way

1060
01:04:04.030 --> 01:04:07.067
to making a pretext argument
that's about discrimination?


1061
01:04:16.209 --> 01:04:18.511
<i>The United States Supreme
Court has made a decision</i>


1062
01:04:18.678 --> 01:04:20.947
<i>that they will hear
President Trump's</i>


1063
01:04:21.081 --> 01:04:22.916
<i>‐ travel ban case. ‐ Tonight,</i>

1064
01:04:23.049 --> 01:04:26.452
<i>the President's original travel
ban's long and legal limbo</i>


1065
01:04:26.586 --> 01:04:28.989
<i>is catching a break
because of the new version</i>


1066
01:04:29.122 --> 01:04:30.256
<i>just unveiled.</i>

1067
01:04:30.490 --> 01:04:32.010
<i>The Trump administration</i>

1068
01:04:32.192 --> 01:04:33.635
<i>is replacing its controversial
travel ban with, quote,</i>


1069
01:04:33.659 --> 01:04:35.295
"tailored travel restrictions".

1070
01:04:35.561 --> 01:04:37.831
<i>The latest version removes Sudan</i>

1071
01:04:37.964 --> 01:04:41.434
<i>and adds Chad,
Venezuela, and North Korea.</i>


1072
01:04:41.601 --> 01:04:43.904
Remember this,
I wasn't thrilled.


1073
01:04:44.804 --> 01:04:47.440
But the lawyers all
said, "Oh, let's tailor it."


1074
01:04:47.773 --> 01:04:50.844
This is a watered‐down
version of the first one.


1075
01:04:51.477 --> 01:04:53.746
This is a watered‐down version.

1076
01:04:54.180 --> 01:04:56.682
And let me tell you something,
I think we ought to go back


1077
01:04:56.816 --> 01:04:58.418
to the first one
and go all the way,


1078
01:04:58.551 --> 01:05:00.453
which is what I wanted
to do in the first place.


1079
01:05:08.428 --> 01:05:10.063
<i>Just one thing after another.</i>

1080
01:05:10.196 --> 01:05:12.365
<i>I mean, right tomorrow,
we have a big hearing</i>


1081
01:05:12.498 --> 01:05:13.834
<i>on family separation.</i>

1082
01:05:14.167 --> 01:05:18.604
- We have two briefs due...
- Monday at 3:00 pm


1083
01:05:18.771 --> 01:05:22.175
in the Supreme Court in
the Muslim ban litigation.


1084
01:05:22.575 --> 01:05:25.445
The government has
asked the Supreme Court


1085
01:05:25.578 --> 01:05:28.748
to let it go into
effect immediately.


1086
01:05:30.383 --> 01:05:34.387
It's another Saturday
here at the ACLU.


1087
01:05:34.720 --> 01:05:36.689
It's your son's
birthday too, right?


1088
01:05:36.857 --> 01:05:39.359
It is my son's birthday.

1089
01:05:45.932 --> 01:05:48.034
<i>Just looking at the city...</i>

1090
01:05:49.069 --> 01:05:52.372
through sort of blurry
eyes, late at night.


1091
01:05:52.672 --> 01:05:55.008
I just‐‐ I never
get tired of it.


1092
01:05:56.843 --> 01:06:01.848
We could hear literally any
time from, I think, tomorrow night


1093
01:06:02.015 --> 01:06:04.584
to the end of June of
whether the Supreme Court


1094
01:06:04.750 --> 01:06:08.821
is gonna allow the
ban to go into effect.


1095
01:06:11.657 --> 01:06:13.493
Anything goin' down?

1096
01:06:14.427 --> 01:06:15.661
No decision.

1097
01:06:18.231 --> 01:06:20.600
Here you are.

1098
01:06:28.708 --> 01:06:31.344
If you could talk to
us through the mic.


1099
01:06:33.013 --> 01:06:35.281
We'll cue you
through this earpiece...


1100
01:06:35.949 --> 01:06:38.518
and you'll be able
to hear the show.


1101
01:06:41.654 --> 01:06:44.424
So Lee, you can go ahead
and have a seat. Um...


1102
01:06:44.724 --> 01:06:45.926
Am I on?

1103
01:06:46.092 --> 01:06:47.532
No, we're waiting
for the travel ban.


1104
01:06:47.660 --> 01:06:49.138
You're gonna be standing by.

1105
01:06:49.162 --> 01:06:50.840
‐ This one? ‐ Yeah. This one.

1106
01:06:50.864 --> 01:06:52.698
Could my chair be closer?

1107
01:06:56.136 --> 01:06:57.237
Tell me when.

1108
01:06:57.370 --> 01:06:59.039
Good. Thanks.

1109
01:07:00.040 --> 01:07:01.875
This fell out also.

1110
01:07:04.510 --> 01:07:06.546
‐You don't hear anything? ‐Nope.

1111
01:07:07.313 --> 01:07:08.581
Do you hear it now?

1112
01:07:08.714 --> 01:07:11.317
<i>The Attorney General
saying...</i> Yeah, now.


1113
01:07:11.451 --> 01:07:12.811
Is it a good level or...?

1114
01:07:12.853 --> 01:07:14.263
‐I need it a little
louder. ‐Yeah, sure.


1115
01:07:14.287 --> 01:07:15.889
<i>The bottom line, you still have</i>

1116
01:07:16.122 --> 01:07:17.922
<i>more than 2,000 kids
who haven't been reunited</i>


1117
01:07:17.991 --> 01:07:19.568
<i>‐ with their families... ‐ Lee,</i>

1118
01:07:19.592 --> 01:07:21.027
<i>you're on in five minutes.</i>

1119
01:07:21.194 --> 01:07:22.839
<i>Top of the show,
which is our first look,</i>


1120
01:07:22.863 --> 01:07:24.397
<i>now, inside one of these</i>

1121
01:07:24.530 --> 01:07:26.142
<i>detention facilities holding
unaccompanied kids.</i>


1122
01:07:26.166 --> 01:07:27.901
This one is in New York. ‐

1123
01:07:28.068 --> 01:07:30.012
Apparently a worker
inside one of these facilities


1124
01:07:30.036 --> 01:07:31.872
<i>in New York handed
over some of this video...</i>


1125
01:07:32.005 --> 01:07:33.639
<i>Four minutes, Lee.</i>

1126
01:07:35.208 --> 01:07:36.576
<i>We have breaking news now.</i>

1127
01:07:36.742 --> 01:07:38.244
<i>The Supreme Court
has now come down</i>


1128
01:07:38.411 --> 01:07:40.446
<i>on its ruling today
regarding one of the most</i>


1129
01:07:40.613 --> 01:07:42.048
anticipated cases of the term.

1130
01:07:42.215 --> 01:07:43.816
We're talking about
Trump v. Hawaii,


1131
01:07:43.984 --> 01:07:46.752
<i>also known as the
president's travel ban case.</i>


1132
01:07:46.887 --> 01:07:50.523
What happened,
Maya? It came down.


1133
01:07:50.656 --> 01:07:51.992
It did?

1134
01:07:52.192 --> 01:07:54.027
<i>The decision says that
President Trump wins.</i>


1135
01:07:54.194 --> 01:07:57.030
<i>The Supreme Court has
upheld the president's travel ban.</i>


1136
01:07:57.163 --> 01:07:59.732
<i>This is the third version
of the attempt to restrict</i>


1137
01:07:59.900 --> 01:08:02.135
<i>travel from mostly
Muslim countries</i>


1138
01:08:02.302 --> 01:08:03.742
<i>after the first two
were struck down.</i>


1139
01:08:03.904 --> 01:08:05.271
<i>Three minutes.</i>

1140
01:08:05.571 --> 01:08:07.771
I can't go on right away. I
need to look at the opinion.


1141
01:08:07.874 --> 01:08:10.310
Can you give me
five more minutes?


1142
01:08:10.543 --> 01:08:12.112
Hey, I need Omar really quickly.

1143
01:08:12.278 --> 01:08:15.448
What's his cell phone number?
What's his cell phone number?


1144
01:08:16.082 --> 01:08:17.117
Pen!

1145
01:08:17.650 --> 01:08:19.685
I'm about to go on live on MSNBC

1146
01:08:19.853 --> 01:08:21.721
'cause I was here
for family separation.


1147
01:08:21.855 --> 01:08:26.026
It's basically just a
straight‐out loss, right?


1148
01:08:31.865 --> 01:08:33.745
<i>Justice prior
announced his dissent</i>


1149
01:08:33.799 --> 01:08:35.768
<i>in that case, too.
So, he is dissenting...</i>


1150
01:08:35.902 --> 01:08:37.337
Though the government remains...

1151
01:08:37.470 --> 01:08:38.638
<i>Sixty seconds.</i>

1152
01:08:38.872 --> 01:08:41.041
Hey, Omar, I gotta go
on in like two minutes.


1153
01:08:41.207 --> 01:08:43.376
I'm just gonna denounce
it, but I just wanna say


1154
01:08:43.543 --> 01:08:45.183
we're gonna evaluate
the opinion to see...


1155
01:08:45.278 --> 01:08:47.347
<i>Lee, we're ready for you now.</i>

1156
01:08:47.480 --> 01:08:49.015
I'll be 30 seconds. Okay, cool.

1157
01:08:49.182 --> 01:08:51.117
Thanks, Omar. Ready now.

1158
01:08:51.384 --> 01:08:53.386
<i>I wanna bring in, I believe
we have Lee Gelernt</i>


1159
01:08:53.553 --> 01:08:55.121
<i>with the ACLU.
Lee, if you're with us,</i>


1160
01:08:55.255 --> 01:08:56.356
<i>what is your reaction?</i>

1161
01:08:56.656 --> 01:08:59.525
It's obviously very bad.
We're very disappointed.


1162
01:08:59.792 --> 01:09:01.327
<i>We believe that
it was no question</i>


1163
01:09:01.461 --> 01:09:04.998
that this was a Muslim
ban, and so we really regret


1164
01:09:05.131 --> 01:09:07.533
that this came out this way.

1165
01:09:07.667 --> 01:09:09.002
<i>I wanna let you know</i>

1166
01:09:09.135 --> 01:09:10.703
<i>we are hearing
now for the first time</i>


1167
01:09:10.837 --> 01:09:12.381
<i>from President Trump
and, yes, it is coming</i>


1168
01:09:12.405 --> 01:09:14.340
<i>from his Twitter account
in all‐caps, writing,</i>


1169
01:09:14.507 --> 01:09:18.011
<i>"Supreme Court upholds
Trump travel ban. Wow!"</i>


1170
01:09:18.144 --> 01:09:19.980
<i>Exclamation point.
The president obviously</i>


1171
01:09:20.180 --> 01:09:22.782
<i>very pleased with the
ruling now coming in.</i>


1172
01:09:49.342 --> 01:09:50.543
Mr. President...

1173
01:09:51.444 --> 01:09:54.881
thank you for the great
honor of appointing me


1174
01:09:55.048 --> 01:09:57.984
to serve as a justice
of the Supreme Court.


1175
01:09:58.784 --> 01:10:02.188
I've seen, first‐hand,
your deep appreciation


1176
01:10:02.355 --> 01:10:05.591
for the vital role of
the American judiciary.


1177
01:10:05.992 --> 01:10:08.929
Mr. President, thank
you for everything.


1178
01:10:23.877 --> 01:10:27.413
Hopefully, I don't f‐‐‐
up my first sentence.


1179
01:10:27.813 --> 01:10:29.950
Mr. Chief Justice, and
may it please the court,


1180
01:10:30.083 --> 01:10:32.919
the secretary's decision
rested on a single assertion


1181
01:10:33.053 --> 01:10:36.722
that it was‐‐ F‐‐‐.

1182
01:10:38.959 --> 01:10:41.027
Mr. Chief Justice, and
may it please the court,


1183
01:10:41.194 --> 01:10:44.564
the secretary's decision
rested on a single assertion,


1184
01:10:44.965 --> 01:10:48.601
that‐‐ F‐‐‐!

1185
01:10:48.969 --> 01:10:52.772
Don't do this tomorrow.

1186
01:10:54.975 --> 01:10:57.010
Mr. Chief Justice, and
may it please the court...


1187
01:10:57.143 --> 01:10:59.212
Mr. Chief Justice, and
may it please the court...


1188
01:10:59.345 --> 01:11:01.547
Mr. Chief Justice, and
may it please the court,


1189
01:11:01.681 --> 01:11:04.885
the secretary's decision
rested on a single assertion,


1190
01:11:05.018 --> 01:11:08.354
that it would provide more
accurate citizenship data


1191
01:11:08.521 --> 01:11:09.923
to the Department of Justice.

1192
01:11:10.223 --> 01:11:13.326
But the administrative record
revealed precisely the opposite,


1193
01:11:13.493 --> 01:11:16.596
that it would result
in less accurate data


1194
01:11:16.762 --> 01:11:18.464
for the Department of Justice.

1195
01:11:18.631 --> 01:11:20.366
And the secretary's explanation

1196
01:11:20.500 --> 01:11:22.903
for his decision ran
counter to the evidence,


1197
01:11:23.036 --> 01:11:24.804
and was thus arbitrary
and capricious...


1198
01:11:24.938 --> 01:11:26.306
arbitrary and capricious...

1199
01:11:26.439 --> 01:11:28.741
arbitrary and capricious
in three respects.


1200
01:11:28.975 --> 01:11:31.077
I'm gonna try to work
my way through my points


1201
01:11:31.244 --> 01:11:33.513
and periodically
interrupt myself


1202
01:11:33.679 --> 01:11:35.048
with a random question.

1203
01:11:35.215 --> 01:11:37.884
I'm gonna try to give my
answer and then pivot back


1204
01:11:38.018 --> 01:11:40.220
to my main points.

1205
01:11:40.786 --> 01:11:42.788
It'll be worse for
Voting Rights Act


1206
01:11:42.956 --> 01:11:44.891
enforcement purposes.

1207
01:11:45.892 --> 01:11:47.660
No, that's not the case.

1208
01:11:47.828 --> 01:11:50.663
Yes, that's right,
but imputation


1209
01:11:50.796 --> 01:11:52.465
would be more accurate.

1210
01:11:52.833 --> 01:11:55.001
Well the standard is
the ordinary arbitrary


1211
01:11:55.135 --> 01:11:58.939
and capricious standard
under, um, Section 706.


1212
01:11:59.072 --> 01:12:00.573
Have you argued in front

1213
01:12:00.706 --> 01:12:02.808
‐of the Supreme
Court before? ‐No.


1214
01:12:03.944 --> 01:12:06.146
Did you expect to be doing it?

1215
01:12:06.312 --> 01:12:07.413
No.

1216
01:12:08.949 --> 01:12:11.017
Do you think you're gonna win?

1217
01:12:12.518 --> 01:12:13.954
I don't know.

1218
01:12:15.455 --> 01:12:17.457
All right.

1219
01:12:17.991 --> 01:12:20.193
It's gotta be muscle memory now.

1220
01:12:25.498 --> 01:12:27.100
I'm gonna do one more.

1221
01:12:42.983 --> 01:12:45.451
I actually went
swimming this morning.


1222
01:12:45.952 --> 01:12:49.455
I figured I might as
well try and relax.


1223
01:12:51.657 --> 01:12:53.026
Did it work?

1224
01:12:53.159 --> 01:12:54.294
Um...

1225
01:12:55.128 --> 01:12:57.497
Not really.

1226
01:12:57.630 --> 01:13:00.166
I haven't been this
nervous in a while for a case.


1227
01:13:00.300 --> 01:13:03.436
I just feel like
I‐‐ One of those‐‐


1228
01:13:03.569 --> 01:13:06.873
these cases I just cannot lose.

1229
01:13:07.040 --> 01:13:10.210
I‐‐ I mean, I could lose
it, I'm just saying I...


1230
01:13:10.343 --> 01:13:14.414
I really feel a lot
of pressure to win.


1231
01:13:14.547 --> 01:13:17.951
I just‐‐ It's so horrendous,
what's happening.


1232
01:13:18.684 --> 01:13:22.622
Just reading these stories
over again this morning


1233
01:13:22.755 --> 01:13:24.090
and last night.

1234
01:13:24.390 --> 01:13:27.727
These little kids are
just being terrorized.


1235
01:13:46.379 --> 01:13:48.781
Here today because
President Trump


1236
01:13:48.949 --> 01:13:51.051
has issued a formal memo,

1237
01:13:51.217 --> 01:13:54.454
three directives
explicitly overturning


1238
01:13:54.587 --> 01:13:56.957
current military policy...

1239
01:13:58.558 --> 01:13:59.826
which...

1240
01:14:00.160 --> 01:14:01.627
Is it "which" or "that"?

1241
01:14:01.794 --> 01:14:04.430
Current military
policy, which allows...


1242
01:14:23.549 --> 01:14:24.717
Okay again.

1243
01:14:24.918 --> 01:14:28.354
Protesters:

1244
01:15:25.211 --> 01:15:27.480
<i>Mr. Chief Justice, and
may it please the court,</i>


1245
01:15:27.747 --> 01:15:31.251
<i>the secretary's decision rested
primarily on one assertion,</i>


1246
01:15:31.584 --> 01:15:34.654
<i>that it would improve the
accuracy of citizenship data</i>


1247
01:15:34.787 --> 01:15:36.422
<i>provided to the
Department of Justice.</i>


1248
01:15:36.589 --> 01:15:38.658
<i>But the administration
record revealed</i>


1249
01:15:38.824 --> 01:15:40.260
<i>precisely the opposite.</i>

1250
01:15:40.426 --> 01:15:42.795
<i>The secretary's
explanation for his decision</i>


1251
01:15:42.963 --> 01:15:45.031
<i>misstated the
evidence in the record</i>


1252
01:15:45.165 --> 01:15:46.833
<i>in three critical respects.</i>

1253
01:15:47.968 --> 01:15:51.471
<i>This is a blanket ban
on abortion for anyone</i>


1254
01:15:51.604 --> 01:15:53.273
<i>while they're in
government custody.</i>


1255
01:15:53.874 --> 01:15:57.543
<i>The class must protect the
ability of all pregnant minors</i>


1256
01:15:57.677 --> 01:15:59.980
<i>to make their own decisions
free from government</i>


1257
01:16:00.113 --> 01:16:02.148
obstruction and interference.

1258
01:16:02.582 --> 01:16:05.418
If there's a transgender
person whose gender dysphoria


1259
01:16:05.551 --> 01:16:07.387
<i>is actually limiting
their ability to serve,</i>


1260
01:16:07.653 --> 01:16:10.390
<i>they can be kicked out
just like any other person</i>


1261
01:16:10.523 --> 01:16:12.558
<i>whose medical condition
is limiting their ability.</i>


1262
01:16:12.792 --> 01:16:15.528
<i>What the president
has done is just irrational</i>


1263
01:16:15.661 --> 01:16:17.063
<i>under any standard.</i>

1264
01:16:17.363 --> 01:16:18.698
<i>They tell the parents</i>

1265
01:16:18.832 --> 01:16:20.666
<i>"We're just taking
your child for a bath."</i>


1266
01:16:20.800 --> 01:16:23.236
<i>Then the parent never
sees the child again.</i>


1267
01:16:23.503 --> 01:16:25.839
<i>And I realize that I am
almost pleading, Your Honor,</i>


1268
01:16:25.972 --> 01:16:28.508
<i>but at this point, we believe
that it is necessary for you</i>


1269
01:16:28.641 --> 01:16:32.145
<i>to issue an injunction
as early as tonight.</i>


1270
01:16:34.280 --> 01:16:36.149
<i>There could be multiple reasons</i>

1271
01:16:36.282 --> 01:16:39.419
<i>why individuals don't
complete the form.</i>


1272
01:16:39.619 --> 01:16:42.222
<i>Do you own your house?
Do you own a radio?</i>


1273
01:16:42.355 --> 01:16:44.090
<i>I mean, the questions
go quite beyond</i>


1274
01:16:44.257 --> 01:16:45.558
<i>how many people there are.</i>

1275
01:16:45.725 --> 01:16:47.245
<i>If the secretary is told,</i>

1276
01:16:47.360 --> 01:16:49.229
<i>"Trust us, it's
gonna be better,"</i>


1277
01:16:49.362 --> 01:16:50.864
is it arbitrary and capricious?

1278
01:16:51.097 --> 01:16:53.575
Justice Alito, respectfully, I
think the Census Bureau said


1279
01:16:53.599 --> 01:16:55.535
<i>a little bit more
than, "Trust us."</i>


1280
01:16:55.701 --> 01:16:58.604
<i>What the Census Bureau said
was, "We can develop a highly</i>


1281
01:16:58.771 --> 01:17:00.874
<i>accurate model for this
that's going to be better</i>


1282
01:17:01.141 --> 01:17:02.575
<i>than getting the question wrong</i>

1283
01:17:02.708 --> 01:17:03.877
<i>"one third of the time."</i>

1284
01:17:04.044 --> 01:17:05.545
<i>The question is,</i>

1285
01:17:05.678 --> 01:17:09.182
<i>it's more important to
get accurate citizenship</i>


1286
01:17:09.349 --> 01:17:11.751
<i>information even at the expense,</i>

1287
01:17:11.885 --> 01:17:13.153
<i>potentially, of a slight</i>

1288
01:17:13.319 --> 01:17:15.788
<i>decrease in response rates.</i>

1289
01:18:20.053 --> 01:18:22.255
We're gonna have to
wait till my phone charges


1290
01:18:22.388 --> 01:18:24.090
for ten minutes and
then go somewhere else.


1291
01:18:24.224 --> 01:18:25.225
Yeah.

1292
01:18:28.528 --> 01:18:30.730
Do you have outlets in here?

1293
01:18:32.132 --> 01:18:36.102
I can't believe I'm going 20
minutes without having a phone.


1294
01:18:38.071 --> 01:18:39.873
I can't even hear. Is it...?

1295
01:18:40.706 --> 01:18:43.977
Is it still not charging?
It should be charging!


1296
01:18:44.110 --> 01:18:45.912
How do I do this?

1297
01:18:46.346 --> 01:18:48.748
‐Stacy? ‐Man: Guys
would you help me,


1298
01:18:48.915 --> 01:18:50.450
85 cents? I'm homeless.

1299
01:18:50.616 --> 01:18:53.519
My phone has run out.
You've gotta give Inga


1300
01:18:53.686 --> 01:18:56.756
this alternative number,
okay? Tell her to call me


1301
01:18:56.923 --> 01:18:58.258
at 347...

1302
01:18:58.524 --> 01:19:01.061
'Cause now I can't
even make calls.


1303
01:19:02.996 --> 01:19:06.066
The judge just issued
a major ruling in the...


1304
01:19:06.232 --> 01:19:08.601
family separation case,
but it came very late


1305
01:19:09.069 --> 01:19:12.238
and now everyone's scrambling
to read it. I had to read it


1306
01:19:12.405 --> 01:19:14.807
really quickly.
And it looks great.


1307
01:19:15.108 --> 01:19:17.543
All the hard parts. He
rejected the government's


1308
01:19:17.710 --> 01:19:20.046
main position that
these families have no


1309
01:19:20.213 --> 01:19:21.573
constitutional
right, and he did it


1310
01:19:21.647 --> 01:19:23.483
in the strongest
possible language,


1311
01:19:23.649 --> 01:19:26.252
calling the family
separation policy "brutal".


1312
01:19:27.653 --> 01:19:30.456
I just‐‐ Now, I just
need my phone to work.


1313
01:19:31.424 --> 01:19:33.526
I've just re‐read
it, and it is really


1314
01:19:33.693 --> 01:19:35.829
an enormous ruling,
because the big issue


1315
01:19:35.996 --> 01:19:38.698
between the parties
was, "Do these families


1316
01:19:38.865 --> 01:19:41.801
have a constitutional
right to remain together?"


1317
01:19:41.968 --> 01:19:45.038
And what he said is, "They
do," and this is the first


1318
01:19:45.205 --> 01:19:49.509
<i>federal judge now to look
at it and say, "It's brutal</i>


1319
01:19:49.675 --> 01:19:52.345
<i>and clearly violates
the Constitution."</i>


1320
01:20:58.611 --> 01:21:01.948
<i>We just got a decision
in the Jane Doe case.</i>


1321
01:21:02.215 --> 01:21:03.455
Class certification is granted.

1322
01:21:03.549 --> 01:21:05.061
Preliminary injunction
as to the class.


1323
01:21:05.085 --> 01:21:10.290
The decision is amazing. The
court says that while O. R. R.


1324
01:21:10.456 --> 01:21:13.693
And Scott Lloyd may
prefer that the minors


1325
01:21:13.860 --> 01:21:16.362
in federal custody carry
their pregnancies to term,


1326
01:21:16.529 --> 01:21:19.966
they may not impose that
belief on minors and strip them


1327
01:21:20.133 --> 01:21:23.669
of their right to their
reproductive decisions.


1328
01:21:24.004 --> 01:21:26.072
Congratulations!
Congratulations!


1329
01:22:00.907 --> 01:22:04.744
<i>We saw, with the Muslim
ban, that Trump does something</i>


1330
01:22:04.911 --> 01:22:08.581
shocking, and then they go
back and try it again to make it


1331
01:22:08.748 --> 01:22:10.626
a little less shocking,
and then again to make it


1332
01:22:10.650 --> 01:22:12.052
a little less shocking.

1333
01:22:12.218 --> 01:22:14.320
<i>And then they go up
to the Supreme Court,</i>


1334
01:22:14.487 --> 01:22:17.490
<i>where they have a more
sympathetic audience.</i>


1335
01:22:27.167 --> 01:22:29.702
<i>So, we could a
denial this morning,</i>


1336
01:22:29.836 --> 01:22:33.006
which would be great, or
the Supreme Court could stay


1337
01:22:33.173 --> 01:22:37.110
the injunctions, which
would be, like, terrible.


1338
01:22:37.978 --> 01:22:41.047
‐ It's 9:30. ‐ Alright. So...

1339
01:22:41.181 --> 01:22:43.516
‐ God damn it! ‐
What? They stayed it?


1340
01:22:43.649 --> 01:22:44.985
<i>They stayed it.</i>

1341
01:22:45.118 --> 01:22:46.920
Oh, f‐‐‐! There
it is right there,


1342
01:22:47.053 --> 01:22:49.522
‐ it's the first thing.
<i>‐ Yeah. Yeah.</i>


1343
01:22:49.822 --> 01:22:54.895
F‐‐‐! So this essentially
means the ban is in effect.


1344
01:22:55.061 --> 01:22:56.362
<i>Yep.</i>

1345
01:23:12.478 --> 01:23:14.981
Everybody was saying,
"Oh, you know, you're safe,


1346
01:23:15.115 --> 01:23:18.718
"you're safe." But, um,
I guess the main thing


1347
01:23:18.885 --> 01:23:22.755
was I felt pretty
disappointed that, you know,


1348
01:23:22.923 --> 01:23:26.026
all the people that were
kind of in line to enlist


1349
01:23:26.159 --> 01:23:27.994
were gonna get screwed.

1350
01:23:29.830 --> 01:23:32.933
<i>It's hard to go to work
and focus on your job</i>


1351
01:23:33.099 --> 01:23:36.402
<i>and do a good job when
you know that maybe</i>


1352
01:23:36.602 --> 01:23:38.604
<i>you're still gonna
get kicked out.</i>


1353
01:23:40.006 --> 01:23:41.774
Maybe the guy sitting
next to you thinks


1354
01:23:41.908 --> 01:23:44.077
that you should be
kicked out, you know?


1355
01:24:15.475 --> 01:24:16.809
<i>When I think about...</i>

1356
01:24:18.744 --> 01:24:22.415
what we expect,
um, today, you know,


1357
01:24:22.582 --> 01:24:25.418
in, like, an adverse
decision, um...


1358
01:24:26.252 --> 01:24:27.854
and I think about, like,

1359
01:24:28.021 --> 01:24:30.056
"Okay, well, next week
I'm on vacation. It's, like,


1360
01:24:30.223 --> 01:24:32.725
finally my time to relax..."

1361
01:24:34.360 --> 01:24:35.661
Hey kiddo.

1362
01:24:37.163 --> 01:24:38.164
Bye.

1363
01:24:43.103 --> 01:24:44.504
‐Thanks. ‐Mm‐hmm.

1364
01:24:46.339 --> 01:24:47.407
‐All right. ‐Good luck.

1365
01:24:47.573 --> 01:24:48.808
Thanks.

1366
01:24:53.713 --> 01:24:57.050
You know, it's gonna
suck if we lose, but...


1367
01:24:57.750 --> 01:25:00.186
I mean, it's awful for
us. It's awful for all of us.


1368
01:25:00.320 --> 01:25:02.155
It's awful for our democracy.

1369
01:25:12.365 --> 01:25:15.035
<i>I never really thought
I'd get an argument</i>


1370
01:25:15.201 --> 01:25:16.702
<i>in the Supreme Court.</i>

1371
01:25:17.770 --> 01:25:19.705
And I sort of
thought that if I did,


1372
01:25:20.473 --> 01:25:25.511
it would be a pretty minor
case. Not something that's like...


1373
01:25:27.680 --> 01:25:29.749
the big bombshell of the day.

1374
01:26:11.291 --> 01:26:12.826
Got the decision.

1375
01:26:19.699 --> 01:26:20.901
Yeah.

1376
01:26:25.505 --> 01:26:26.940
Yeah, we lost.

1377
01:26:37.918 --> 01:26:39.219
Wait a minute, what?

1378
01:26:43.089 --> 01:26:44.090
Did I?

1379
01:26:45.058 --> 01:26:46.960
Did I read that too fast?

1380
01:26:48.929 --> 01:26:52.232
What the f... I can't
understand what's happening.


1381
01:26:52.732 --> 01:26:55.035
Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.


1382
01:26:55.168 --> 01:26:56.569
We...

1383
01:26:59.205 --> 01:27:00.974
won on...

1384
01:27:02.275 --> 01:27:04.845
on establishing
that it was pretextual.


1385
01:27:09.349 --> 01:27:10.951
Hey. ‐Hey, hey, hey. So, um...

1386
01:27:11.117 --> 01:27:15.688
What's up? ‐Uh, uh,
uh... It's confusing.


1387
01:27:15.821 --> 01:27:18.091
They're agreeing
with us that the agency


1388
01:27:18.224 --> 01:27:21.527
wasn't truthful about why they
added the citizenship question.


1389
01:27:21.761 --> 01:27:23.663
‐ Okay. ‐ The pretext point.

1390
01:27:23.897 --> 01:27:25.698
They can't print the
forms on Monday


1391
01:27:25.832 --> 01:27:27.333
with the question on it.

1392
01:27:28.034 --> 01:27:30.436
<i>Okay. So...</i>

1393
01:27:30.803 --> 01:27:32.472
‐I mean, is it a... ‐It's a...

1394
01:27:32.605 --> 01:27:35.608
Voting rights
victory? ‐It's like a win!


1395
01:27:38.544 --> 01:27:40.847
<i>Do you want me to
send the win version?</i>


1396
01:27:41.948 --> 01:27:44.517
Hey! ‐We're still
winning right now.


1397
01:27:44.650 --> 01:27:46.319
We're winning right now. ‐ Yeah.

1398
01:27:46.452 --> 01:27:48.021
I gotta get the opinion.

1399
01:27:50.023 --> 01:27:53.193
And I saw, like, a dissent
from the four liberals, and I‐‐


1400
01:27:53.359 --> 01:27:55.661
I just assumed that
meant it's over, and the‐‐


1401
01:27:55.795 --> 01:27:57.964
Every first part of
the opinion was...


1402
01:27:58.198 --> 01:28:00.066
"It's not
substantively invalid."


1403
01:28:00.200 --> 01:28:01.968
I just feel like
an idiot right now.


1404
01:28:02.102 --> 01:28:04.437
I forgot to send
it to the printer.


1405
01:28:04.670 --> 01:28:05.805
<i>To who?</i>

1406
01:28:05.972 --> 01:28:07.340
Oh, Inga! Hey
sorry, you're there.


1407
01:28:07.640 --> 01:28:10.000
I forgot to send the opinion
to the printer. I have to‐‐ I‐‐


1408
01:28:10.143 --> 01:28:12.045
I actually have to
read the damn thing.


1409
01:28:15.448 --> 01:28:16.582
Holy shit!

1410
01:28:17.217 --> 01:28:19.419
Holy shit! ‐Lawyer: We won!

1411
01:28:21.487 --> 01:28:23.656
Look, it's not over! I mean,
they're gonna come back


1412
01:28:23.823 --> 01:28:24.991
‐and try again. ‐Pretext!

1413
01:28:25.125 --> 01:28:26.235
Yeah, you're
right! You're right!


1414
01:28:26.259 --> 01:28:27.693
Yes! ‐Ho: You're right!

1415
01:28:27.828 --> 01:28:29.005
Congress has to have hearings.

1416
01:28:29.029 --> 01:28:30.263
Like, everything in sight

1417
01:28:30.396 --> 01:28:32.398
to make sure this
question does not get on.


1418
01:28:32.532 --> 01:28:33.733
You won!

1419
01:28:33.867 --> 01:28:35.568
Hello?

1420
01:28:35.735 --> 01:28:37.137
<i>Hey Dale. Congratulations!</i>

1421
01:28:37.270 --> 01:28:39.639
‐We won! ‐Cole:
<i>Can you believe this?</i>


1422
01:28:39.873 --> 01:28:41.550
I mean, I was reading
the thing. I thought we lost.


1423
01:28:41.574 --> 01:28:43.752
I know! I did the same thing!
I was reading the syllabus


1424
01:28:43.776 --> 01:28:45.245
‐ and I was like... <i>‐ Exactly!</i>

1425
01:28:45.378 --> 01:28:46.546
<i>We won on pretext!</i>

1426
01:28:47.213 --> 01:28:48.949
<i>But that's unbelievable,</i>

1427
01:28:49.082 --> 01:28:52.318
‐so unbelievable. ‐Holy shit!

1428
01:28:52.886 --> 01:28:54.787
Oh my God!

1429
01:28:54.988 --> 01:28:58.491
‐ Oh my God!
‐ Cole: <i>Oh my God.</i>

1430
01:28:58.624 --> 01:29:01.394
At first I was like, "Oh
shit, this is just temporary."


1431
01:29:01.527 --> 01:29:03.964
But the more I think
about it, the more I think


1432
01:29:04.097 --> 01:29:06.766
that they can't do it.

1433
01:29:07.133 --> 01:29:10.770
We have a ruling from the Court
that we can rely on discovery.


1434
01:29:10.971 --> 01:29:12.572
I mean, forget it.

1435
01:29:13.239 --> 01:29:16.309
We will fuck them
up if they try to do this.


1436
01:29:16.442 --> 01:29:18.478
We will go back into
court. We will depose


1437
01:29:18.611 --> 01:29:22.315
‐ all of these
m‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐. ‐ Cole:


1438
01:29:25.018 --> 01:29:27.153
Congrats! Maybe you
should go on the other side


1439
01:29:27.287 --> 01:29:31.391
Okay, I've never done
that before. Oh, God.


1440
01:29:33.226 --> 01:29:34.294
Hey!

1441
01:29:34.494 --> 01:29:37.964
Hey!

1442
01:30:06.659 --> 01:30:08.528
Hello? ‐We won.

1443
01:30:08.694 --> 01:30:12.165
<i>I know, I'm crying! I'm,
like, shaking and crying.</i>


1444
01:30:12.332 --> 01:30:14.935
That's so amazing!

1445
01:30:16.636 --> 01:30:19.906
<i>Oh, my God, it's so amazing!</i>

1446
01:30:22.175 --> 01:30:23.476
We won.

1447
01:30:23.676 --> 01:30:26.579
<i>I'm so‐‐</i>

1448
01:30:26.712 --> 01:30:28.849
<i>I'm so incredibly proud</i>

1449
01:30:28.982 --> 01:30:32.452
<i>and happy. That's
so great. It's so great.</i>


1450
01:30:48.368 --> 01:30:51.071
All I've ever known
how to do is fight,


1451
01:30:51.204 --> 01:30:53.382
and so we just keep fighting.
And even though we're tired


1452
01:30:53.406 --> 01:30:55.842
and even though it's
exhausting and it's maddening,


1453
01:30:55.976 --> 01:30:57.310
<i>it's what we do.</i>

1454
01:31:06.853 --> 01:31:09.890
In Section One‐‐
Is it Section One?


1455
01:31:13.626 --> 01:31:17.864
<i>There's a significant risk
of the courts coming up</i>


1456
01:31:17.998 --> 01:31:20.533
with some constitutional
right to discriminate


1457
01:31:20.666 --> 01:31:22.002
against LGBT people.

1458
01:31:22.135 --> 01:31:26.706
To not only, um, you
know, stop protecting


1459
01:31:26.840 --> 01:31:29.575
them under the Constitution,
but striking down laws


1460
01:31:29.709 --> 01:31:30.944
designed to protect them.

1461
01:31:31.577 --> 01:31:34.614
We don't know what
the full fallout will be.


1462
01:31:35.281 --> 01:31:38.218
There is a fight going
on and we don't exist


1463
01:31:38.351 --> 01:31:40.520
on the terms of
government definitions.


1464
01:31:40.653 --> 01:31:43.489
We exist because
we are here right now.


1465
01:31:59.705 --> 01:32:01.741
<i>A lot of people have
been running up to us</i>


1466
01:32:01.875 --> 01:32:04.077
<i>"saying things like, you
know, "You're our hope</i>


1467
01:32:04.210 --> 01:32:07.447
<i>against the forces that
have put Trump in power,"</i>


1468
01:32:07.580 --> 01:32:10.216
and, "You're gonna be
what's gonna stop this thing."


1469
01:32:10.350 --> 01:32:11.952
And I think that's wrong.

1470
01:32:12.085 --> 01:32:15.555
Like, we're not gonna be
able to stop this thing ourselves.


1471
01:32:15.688 --> 01:32:17.958
I mean, we're, like,
two‐and‐a‐half floors


1472
01:32:18.091 --> 01:32:20.126
of a building in
New York, right?


1473
01:32:20.260 --> 01:32:21.494
I mean we're not,

1474
01:32:21.727 --> 01:32:23.429
against the power of
the federal government


1475
01:32:23.563 --> 01:32:26.099
and this massive
political movement.


1476
01:32:27.267 --> 01:32:29.169
<i>We're not gonna solve it.</i>

1477
01:32:32.638 --> 01:32:35.909
<i>I think if anyone expects us
to, they need to take a look</i>


1478
01:32:36.042 --> 01:32:37.119
<i>in the mirror and ask themselves</i>

1479
01:32:37.143 --> 01:32:38.511
<i>what are they gonna do.</i>

1480
01:32:39.445 --> 01:32:41.081
It's not gonna be
lawyers in courts.


1481
01:32:41.214 --> 01:32:44.851
It's gonna be people who,
um, turn the ship around.


1482
01:33:10.276 --> 01:33:11.677
She's here.

1483
01:33:16.516 --> 01:33:18.118
Oh my goodness.

1484
01:33:19.285 --> 01:33:20.653
‐Hello! ‐Hi.

1485
01:33:20.820 --> 01:33:23.556
‐Hello, Hello! 
Welcome! ‐Hi.
