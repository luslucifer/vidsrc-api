3
00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:05.170
我不知道如何 讲述这个故事
I have no idea how to tell this story.


4
00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:08.940
我甚至不知道 从哪里开始讲起
I don't even know how to start it.


5
00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:11.170
比如 我可以用那种 牛逼作家讲故事的
Like, I guess I could use one of those classic


6
00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:13.940
经典开头
story beginning sentences.


7
00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:17.010
"这是最好的时代 这是最坏的时代"
"It was the best of times; it was the worst of times."


8
00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:19.710
但这又有什么意义呢？
But what would that even mean?


9
00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.580
我是说 可能在世界上的某个地方
I mean, obviously, somewhere in the world,


10
00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:23.880
对于某人来说 这是最好的时代
it's the best of times for someone.


11
00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.780
比如 他狼吞虎咽
Like he's eating all this insane


12
00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:27.320
他免费得到的越南菜
Vietnamese food he just got for free...


13
00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:29.320
然后 给他送餐的女士
...and the woman who delivered the food


14
00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:31.690
热辣得就像 造反猫咪乐队里那些尤物一样
looks exactly like the hot girl from Pussy Riot


15
00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:33.860
而此刻 她正坐在角落
and now she's situated in the corner


16
00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:36.160
在竖琴上 弹奏着 难以言说的美妙旋律
playing unspeakably beautiful melodies on the harp.


17
00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:38.060
他就伴着这样的美妙音乐吃吃吃
While he's just going to town on that food.


18
00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:40.860
这么说的话 他确实在“最好的时代”
So, yeah, that's the best of times.


19
00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.030
但与此同时 在世界另一个角落 另一个人
Meanwhile, some other guy is having


20
00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:44.860
他的意志 被欺凌专业户折磨
his will broken by professional torturers...


21
00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:48.200
被扔进一个 满是鳄鱼的酸性池
over a crocodile-infested pool of acid.


22
00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:49.870
正因为是酸性池
And because it's acid,


23
00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:51.940
所以鳄鱼们都脾气不小
these crocodiles are just pissed.


24
00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:54.100
他们还从通风管道里 排入那种
And they're also piping in that gross smell you get...


25
00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:55.740
在学校停车场泼牛奶时
...when they spill a bunch of milk


26
00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:56.900
的那种臭气
in the school parking lot.


27
00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:58.770
然后四肢发达的欺凌专业户
And this beefy torture dude


28
00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:00.710
把他的翔都打出来了
is just punching the hell out of him.


29
00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:02.810
这 绝对是“最坏的时代”
Check.


30
00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:09.820
我不知道我在什么

31
00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:13.820
好吧 好吧 我还是讲我的故事吧
All right, look. I'll just start.


32
00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:15.850
这个故事讲的是我的高三
This is the story of my senior year of high school


33
00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:17.750
以及这段日子是如何毁了我的生活
and how it destroyed my life.


34
00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:20.790
又及我是拍了怎么样烂的一部电影 烂到真的“烂死”了一个人
And how I made a film so bad, it literally killed someone.


35
00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:27.620
片名：我 和 厄 尔 以 及 将
死 的 女 孩 中字by @Ash十架 /微博

36
00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:41.120
我是这么开始高三生活的

37
00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:50.180
我曾经这么觉得：
I used to think about it this way:


38
00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:53.290
Schenley高中 是一个自己的小小世界
Schenley High School was a world unto itself.


39
00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:56.190
上到高三 我已经颇为牛逼地掌握了
By senior year, I had mastered the languages and customs


40
00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:58.090
每一个小团体的 风俗和语言
of its various sovereign states.


41
00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:00.820
体育生打招呼的方式是点头
The head nods of Jock Nation.


42
00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:03.230
吸大麻的团体 习惯击拳
The fist bumps of the Kingdom of Stoners.


43
00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:05.060
戏剧社的白痴们
The innocuous witticisms of


44
00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:06.260
喜欢说 无伤大雅的俏皮话
The People's Republic of Theater Dorks.


45
00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:08.660
Greg 你暑假过得如何？
Greg, how was your summer?


46
00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:10.730
暑假（Summer）？我都不知道这词啥意思
Summer. What does that word even mean?


47
00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:12.700
是"summ"的比较级吗？
Like, more "summ"?


48
00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:13.870
在传统的高中生活中
In a typical high school life,


49
00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:16.000
我们都要挑选一个属于自己的团体
you belong to one nation...


50
00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.370
但这样 也不能保证你100%的安全感
...which can never guarantee you total security.


51
00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:21.270
不过 我想了个好主意
But I thought I found a way out.


52
00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:25.280
在每个团体 都成为合法公民
Get citizenship in every nation.


53
00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:28.680
在每个团体 都可互通有无
Get passports to everywhere.


54
00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:30.980
低调地与每个人都成为好友
Just be on low-key good terms with everyone...


55
00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:33.180
时不时跟他们交流一下
...casually interact with them once in a while...


56
00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:35.350
只要别让其他团体发现就好
...in a way that is invisible to everyone else.


57
00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:38.020
拒绝一切不是非正式的
Never commit to an interaction


58
00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:39.790
以及非暴力的交流
that won't be casual or mellow.


59
00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:42.250
你的小考是在今天吗？
Your test was today?


60
00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:44.360
天啦噜 小考！我懂你
Ugh. Tests! I've been there.


61
00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:47.130
就好像是往阿富汗输送士兵
That's like sending troops to Afghanistan.


62
00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:49.130
让他们与世界上最暴乱的国家的公民
Maintain relationships with citizens


63
00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:50.730
保持一种关系
of the most dicked-upon nations.


64
00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:53.200
比如说 Scott Mayhew
For example, Scott Mayhew,


65
00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:55.230
我身边坐着的这位 哥特狂魔
the gothy dork I'm sitting next to here.


66
00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:56.370
Scott 你这狂暴战士不错啊
Scott, nice Berserker.


67
00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:58.200
...谢了?
Thank you?


68
00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:00.700
我花费了几年的时间用心栽培 才赢得他的信任
It took years of cultivation to win his trust.


69
00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:06.310
或者是随大流地一起抵制Ill Phil
Or the universally ostracized Ill Phil.


70
00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:11.340
这就是传说中的大一统
Truly a nation of one.


71
00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:16.920
当然 也有一些地方 我是绝对不能去的
And there were some places I simply couldn't go.


72
00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:19.380
比如食堂
Like the cafeteria.


73
00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:22.190
在那里 每个角落 都充满着恐怖主义
Every last square inch of it was disputed territory.


74
00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:24.960
就像是克里米亚 克什米尔
It was Crimea, Kashmir,


75
00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:26.720
还有加沙地带的结合体
and the Gaza Strip all rolled into one.


76
00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:31.460
可能还包括着 印度洋上的海盗
Also the part of the Indian Ocean with pirates.


77
00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:35.360
是《菲利普船长》里那种 海盗 不是 《加勒比海盗》那种
Captain Phillips pirates, not Pirates of the Caribbean.


78
00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:38.000
不过 谁知道呢 或许两种都有
Although, actually, who knows? Maybe both.


79
00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:46.140
“梦想的负担” 所以 我都在老师办公室里吃午饭
Instead, I always ate lunch in the office


80
00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:47.440
他是我们的历史老师
of my history teacher.


81
00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:48.470
McCarthy先生
Mr. McCarthy.


82
00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:50.370
事实:
Fact:


83
00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:53.440
我要在309待...20分钟
I'm in 309 for the next... 20 minutes.


84
00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:57.350
他是Schenley高中 唯一一个正常的成年人
The only reasonable adult in all of Schenley.


85
00:04:57.350 --> 00:04:58.880
小鬼们
Heathens.


86
00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:00.810
尊重研究！
Respect the research.


87
00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:03.020
我一般跟Earl在一起 他在我人生中扮演的角色
With Earl, whose role in my life


88
00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:05.790
我现在不准备给你们解释
I'm not even gonna try to explain to you right now.


89
00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:10.290
屏幕上播放赫尔佐格的《路上行舟》 的幕后特辑
The harmony of overwhelming and collective murder.


90
00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:12.390
最后还有 火辣的校花美女们 她们真的是祸水啊
Hot girls destroy your life.


91
00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:16.530
这就是铁一般的事实 不管这美女是不是个好人
It doesn't matter if the hot girl is also a good person.


92
00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:19.400
她是这头麋鹿 而你就是这只花栗鼠
She's a moose, you're a chipmunk.


93
00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:21.000
那啥 她只是在树林里遛个弯
She's just wandering through the forest, oblivious.


94
00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.230
根本就不会注意到 她其实踩得你脑浆迸裂
And she doesn't even know that she stomped on your head.


95
00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:29.040
嗨 Madison
Hey, Madison.


96
00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:31.140
嘿 你暑假过得怎么样
Hey, how was your summer?


97
00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:33.770
暑假 这词到底什么意思啊
Summer. What does that word even mean, right?


98
00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:36.410
"summ"的比较级
More "summ."


99
00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:39.080
那寒假（Winter）也是一样咯 "wint"的比较级
Winter, same deal. More "wint"?


100
00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:41.910
McCarthy先生在309教室
McCarthy's in 309.


101
00:05:41.910 --> 00:05:44.210
很好 谢谢
Great, thanks.


102
00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:46.150
在这一切势不可挡的痛苦
To become humbled


103
00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:48.120
和势不可挡的荒唐
in front of this overwhelming misery...


104
00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:51.190
以及势不可挡的混乱面前...
...and overwhelming fornication


105
00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:52.920
保持低调谦恭
and overwhelming lack of order.


106
00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:54.160
女人啊
Titties.


107
00:05:56.930 --> 00:05:58.460
亲爱的 我们能进来吗？ 天啊 天啊
Honey, can we come in? Jesus, Jesus!


108
00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:00.860
好啊 什么事？
Yeah. What do you want?


109
00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:02.460
首先 我偷看了你的东西
First of all, I was going through...


110
00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:04.930
然后我看到...
...your stuff and I saw that you


111
00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:06.530
你的大学词典还没拆包呢
have not even unwrapped your college directory.


112
00:06:06.530 --> 00:06:08.230
妈 别偷看我东西 行吗
Mom, don't go through my stuff.


113
00:06:08.230 --> 00:06:11.270
我们讨论过了 所以她才去偷看你的东西
We discussed it, and she gets to go through your stuff.


114
00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:12.940
你来看一下嘛 很好玩的
Just have a look. It's fun.


115
00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:14.240
就像是写满你未来的菜单
It's like a menu for your future.


116
00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:17.070
你想来点儿什么？宾州大学？
What are you in the mood for? Some Penn State?


117
00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:19.840
佩珀代因？波莫纳？普林斯顿？
Some Pepperdine? Pomona? Princeton?


118
00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:21.040
我才不会去上普林斯顿
I'm not getting into Princeton.


119
00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:21.940
他不上普林斯顿
He's not getting into Princeton.


120
00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:24.480
呃 那就这样吧
Um, so, is that it?


121
00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:26.450
不 亲爱的 我们还没说完
No, honey, it's not it.


122
00:06:26.450 --> 00:06:28.080
我和你爸想跟你谈一些挺难过的事
Your father and I want to talk to you about something kind of sad.


123
00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:32.250
啥事？
What?


124
00:06:36.450 --> 00:06:38.250
怎么了？
What happened?


125
00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:40.390
是这样 我刚和Denise Kushner通完电话
Well, I just got off the phone with Denise Kushner,


126
00:06:40.390 --> 00:06:42.560
她是Rachel的妈妈 你认识她吧？
Rachel's mom. You know Denise?


127
00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:44.390
呃 不认识
Um, not really.


128
00:06:44.390 --> 00:06:45.960
那你是Rachel的朋友吧
You're friends with Rachel, though.


129
00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:47.190
是 我们认识而已
Yeah, I mean, we're like, acquainted.


130
00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:48.930
来
Come here.


131
00:06:50.430 --> 00:06:51.330
好
Okay.


132
00:06:57.870 --> 00:07:00.440
Rachel刚被确诊 得了白血病
Rachel's been diagnosed with leukemia.


133
00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:01.970
他们刚刚查出的
They just found out.


134
00:07:03.470 --> 00:07:05.010
你的[检查]是在今天吗？
Your test was today?


135
00:07:07.610 --> 00:07:09.340
天啦噜 我懂你
Ugh. Tests! I've been there.


136
00:07:11.380 --> 00:07:12.880
我的天啊
Oh, God.


137
00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:17.180
很严重吗？
Is that serious?


138
00:07:17.180 --> 00:07:18.420
他们现在正在做各种检查
They're doing all kinds of tests.


139
00:07:18.420 --> 00:07:19.580
力所能及地帮助她
They're doing everything they can.


140
00:07:19.590 --> 00:07:21.150
不过他们也不知道
They just don't know.


141
00:07:21.150 --> 00:07:23.050
天 这太烂了
Man, that sucks.


142
00:07:23.050 --> 00:07:24.190
你说的没错
You're right.


143
00:07:24.190 --> 00:07:26.320
太烂了
It sucks.


144
00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:28.290
烂到不行了
It sucks really bad.


145
00:07:28.290 --> 00:07:30.090
真是一件大烂事
It sucks quite a bit.


146
00:07:30.390 --> 00:07:31.360
是
Yeah.


147
00:07:37.460 --> 00:07:39.300
爸 史蒂猫挠我诶 （Cat Stevens是英国知名民谣歌手 恰巧名字中有一个"猫"字)
Dad, Cat Stevens is clawing me.


148
00:07:39.300 --> 00:07:41.170
他也在心烦意乱呢
Well, he's deeply distraught.


149
00:07:42.300 --> 00:07:44.200
是这样 我跟Denise聊了一下
Well, you know, I was talking to Denise...


150
00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:46.600
Denise觉得 你可能
...and Denise feels that you might be someone...


151
00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:49.000
能让Rachel感觉好些
...who could make Rachel feel better.


152
00:07:49.510 --> 00:07:51.510
但是 我都说了
Yeah, but like I said,


153
00:07:51.510 --> 00:07:52.510
我们俩真的不算是朋友
we're not really friends, so...


154
00:07:52.510 --> 00:07:54.240
你可以给Rachel打个电话
Just give Rachel a call.


155
00:07:55.380 --> 00:07:57.040
好啊 那你想让我说点啥呢？
Yeah, well, what do you want me to say?


156
00:07:57.050 --> 00:07:58.350
就说 "嘿 我是Greg 就是那个
"Hey, it's Greg, the guy who's


157
00:07:58.350 --> 00:07:59.750
"之前从没注意过你的男孩子
"never really paid attention to you...


158
00:07:59.750 --> 00:08:02.080
"...但是现在你得癌症了 所以我们一起玩吧"吗？?
"...but now you have cancer, so let's hang out"?


159
00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:03.320
不行 不能这么说
That's not gonna work.


160
00:08:03.320 --> 00:08:04.480
她会觉得你在讽刺她的
She'll think you're being sarcastic.


161
00:08:04.490 --> 00:08:05.750
你是想告诉我 你从来不会
Are you telling me you can't do


162
00:08:05.750 --> 00:08:07.650
为其他人做一件好事吗？
one nice thing for another person?


163
00:08:07.650 --> 00:08:09.690
你认真的吗？你真是这个意思吗？
I mean, honestly, is that really what's happening here?


164
00:08:09.690 --> 00:08:12.060
好吧
Fine. Okay.


165
00:08:12.060 --> 00:08:14.320
只是 真的 请别再偷看我的东西了
Just, please don't go through my stuff.


166
00:08:14.330 --> 00:08:16.660
不然我就去偷看你的了
Or I'll start going through your stuff.


167
00:08:16.660 --> 00:08:19.330
看吧 反正都是卫生棉条
I hope you like tampons.

181
00:08:56.190 --> 00:08:57.720

What?


187
00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:08.530

What were you gonna say?


188
00:09:09.230 --> 00:09:10.270
呃...
Um...


189
00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:12.600
Greg 你到底要说什么

190
00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:15.040
呃 我只是打电话来问问你
Uh, yeah, I was just calling to see


191
00:09:15.040 --> 00:09:16.570
要不要跟我一起玩
if you wanted to hang out.


192
00:09:17.170 --> 00:09:18.300
现在？
Right now?


193
00:09:18.740 --> 00:09:20.400
是啊
Um, sure.


194
00:09:21.240 --> 00:09:22.370
不要了 谢了

195
00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:24.610
哦
Oh.


196
00:09:24.610 --> 00:09:26.610
那你是不想和我玩咯
Okay, so you don't wanna hang out?


197
00:09:26.610 --> 00:09:28.310
不想 不过还是谢谢你
No. Thanks anyways.


198
00:09:29.310 --> 00:09:31.410
好吧 那啥 再见
Okay. Um, bye.


199
00:09:31.780 --> 00:09:32.710
拜拜
Bye.


200
00:09:34.680 --> 00:09:36.580
妈 你又在干啥啊
Mom, what are you doing?


201
00:09:36.590 --> 00:09:38.450
听着 妈 她不想见我
Okay, Mom, listen, she doesn't want to see me.


202
00:09:38.450 --> 00:09:40.090
我真的不想这么说 Gregory
I'm sorry to be the one to tell you, Gregory...


203
00:09:40.090 --> 00:09:41.050
但是在这样的情况下
...that you do not have a choice


204
00:09:41.050 --> 00:09:42.490
我们通常是没有选择的
in this particular matter.


205
00:09:42.490 --> 00:09:43.750
妈 让我说一句话 好么
Mom, please, let me say one thing for one second.


206
00:09:43.760 --> 00:09:45.290
这是你的大好机会
You have been given an opportunity


207
00:09:45.290 --> 00:09:47.390
可以给他人的生命 带去不一样的改变
to make a very real difference in someone's life.


208
00:09:47.390 --> 00:09:48.790
但如果你选择了
And if what you're choosing instead


209
00:09:48.790 --> 00:09:49.820
每天在家里挺尸
is to lie around the house all day...


210
00:09:49.830 --> 00:09:52.460
她又不想见我！
She doesn't want to see me!


211
00:09:52.460 --> 00:09:54.160
那我就要好好管管你了
...I will be required to step in...


212
00:09:54.160 --> 00:09:56.260
我们连朋友都不是！
We're not even friends!


213
00:09:56.260 --> 00:09:58.530
跟你说 你这样的行为 不可接受
...and inform you that that is 100% unacceptable.


214
00:09:58.530 --> 00:10:01.170
你唠唠叨叨的快把我逼疯了！
Your nonstop stream of words is making me freak out!


215
00:10:01.170 --> 00:10:02.500
如果你觉得你的这些借口
And if you think that all these excuses you're making


216
00:10:02.500 --> 00:10:04.200
比一个患癌的女孩的快乐
are in any way better...


217
00:10:04.200 --> 00:10:06.340
更有趣...
...or more important, than the happiness


218
00:10:06.340 --> 00:10:07.700
或者更重要的话
of a girl with cancer...


219
00:10:07.710 --> 00:10:09.340
妈 你搞得我里外不是人啊
Mom! I am now entering a subhuman state.


220
00:10:09.340 --> 00:10:10.640
患癌的是你的朋友啊
...a friend with cancer,


221
00:10:10.640 --> 00:10:12.510
你犯下了一个可悲的错误 小朋友
you are sadly mistaken, my friend.


222
00:10:14.110 --> 00:10:16.310
你现在就拿起电话来
You are going to pick up that phone.


223
00:10:16.310 --> 00:10:18.780
再给Rachel打个电话
You're going to call Rachel again.


224
00:10:18.780 --> 00:10:20.680
现在就打 现在就打
You are going to. You are going to.


225
00:10:27.980 --> 00:10:32.290
我是这么和将死的女孩见面的

226
00:10:49.270 --> 00:10:50.740
哦 Greg.
Oh, Greg.


227
00:10:52.880 --> 00:10:54.640
哦 Kushner夫人
Oh, Mrs. Kushner.


228
00:10:55.350 --> 00:10:56.580
Greg 叫我Denise
Denise, Greg.


229
00:10:57.480 --> 00:10:59.550
对你来说 我是Denise 好吗
To you, I'm Denise, okay?


230
00:10:59.550 --> 00:11:01.710
好吧 好的
Oh, okay. Good.


231
00:11:01.720 --> 00:11:04.380
你知道吗 你是个很好的孩子
You're a real good kid, you know that?


232
00:11:04.390 --> 00:11:06.520
真的 你心地真的很善良
You really are. You just have a big heart.


233
00:11:07.550 --> 00:11:09.490
你又善良又体贴
You're kind, nice.


234
00:11:11.660 --> 00:11:13.460
真的很谢谢你
I really appreciate it.


235
00:11:14.590 --> 00:11:15.660
谢谢
Thank you.


236
00:11:18.230 --> 00:11:20.290

237
00:11:22.360 --> 00:11:23.430

238
00:11:23.430 --> 00:11:25.160

240
00:11:28.340 --> 00:11:30.400
...特别特别特别可口的小男孩
...yummy, yummy, young boy.


241
00:11:31.740 --> 00:11:34.500
你真的帅呆了
And you're so, so, handsome.


242
00:11:34.510 --> 00:11:37.170
我一点都不帅 不过谢谢你
Oh, I'm not handsome, but thank you.


243
00:11:37.180 --> 00:11:39.580
还这么谦虚
And so modest.


244
00:11:39.580 --> 00:11:40.680
是 我就是谦逊得跟耗子似的
I guess I'm a modest mouse.


245
00:11:43.180 --> 00:11:45.610
Greg 你是怎么想出这个说法来的？
Greg, where do you come up with this stuff?


246
00:11:45.620 --> 00:11:48.250
哦 只是引用一个乐队名字
Well, that's the name of a band, actually.


247
00:11:48.250 --> 00:11:49.420
哦 是
Oh. Yeah.


248
00:11:50.220 --> 00:11:51.780
Rachel!
Rachel!


249
00:11:51.790 --> 00:11:54.590
一只谦逊的小耗子来看你了
I've got a modest little mouse here to see you!


250
00:11:55.420 --> 00:11:56.650
Rachel
Rachel.


251
00:11:56.660 --> 00:11:58.320
Greg 你来干嘛？
Greg, what are you doing here?


252
00:11:59.460 --> 00:12:00.490
呃...
So, uh...


253
00:12:01.690 --> 00:12:03.220
...上次给你说的那个医生
...the doctor really recommends


254
00:12:03.230 --> 00:12:05.560
他真的强烈推荐Greg这个药给你
a strong dosage of Gregitor.


255
00:12:05.560 --> 00:12:06.830
这笑话你上次讲过了
You already used that joke.


256
00:12:06.830 --> 00:12:07.760
没有
No.


257
00:12:09.230 --> 00:12:11.700
上次我说的是另外一种Greg药
No, 'cause last time it was about Greg-acil...


258
00:12:11.700 --> 00:12:14.600
你还记得吗 上次是一种胶囊
...which if you recall comes in convenient gel-tab form.


259
00:12:14.600 --> 00:12:16.670
这样 我不想让你和我一起玩
Look, I don't want you hanging out with me.


260
00:12:16.670 --> 00:12:18.300
我不想要你愚蠢的怜悯
I don't need your stupid pity.


261
00:12:18.300 --> 00:12:19.270
没关系 你可以走
It's fine, you can just go.


262
00:12:19.270 --> 00:12:20.770
不 不
No, no.


263
00:12:20.770 --> 00:12:23.370
你错了 我不是怜悯你
You got it all wrong. I'm not here 'cause I pity you.


264
00:12:23.370 --> 00:12:25.840
我来这 只是因为我妈妈逼我来
I'm actually here because my mom is making me.


265
00:12:27.410 --> 00:12:28.910
还不如怜悯呢
That's actually worse.


266
00:12:28.910 --> 00:12:31.180
是 我知道
Yeah, I know.


267
00:12:31.180 --> 00:12:34.510
没关系的 真的 我没事 你走吧
Look, it's okay. Honestly, I'm fine. Just... just go.


268
00:12:34.520 --> 00:12:36.850
好吧 Rachel 你听我说
Okay, Rachel, just listen to me for a second.


269
00:12:38.280 --> 00:12:40.820
如果我不跟你玩的话
My mom is gonna turn my life into a living hell...


270
00:12:40.820 --> 00:12:43.290
我妈妈就会把我的人生变成活地狱
...if I don't hang out with you.


271
00:12:43.290 --> 00:12:46.660
你知道她为了这事儿唠叨得我多烦吗 我都没法儿跟你说
I can't overstate how annoying she's being about this.


272
00:12:46.660 --> 00:12:49.330
他简直就是唠叨界的勒布朗·詹姆斯
She's basically like the LeBron James of nagging.


273
00:12:51.460 --> 00:12:52.790
就打篮球那个
LeBron James plays basketball.


274
00:12:52.800 --> 00:12:53.960
我知道勒布朗·詹姆斯
I know who LeBron James is.


275
00:12:55.430 --> 00:12:58.500
我知道我并没帮上你什么忙
Look, I know I'm not doing you any favors here.


276
00:12:58.500 --> 00:13:00.670
但是 我是真心求你帮我一个忙
What I'm asking is for you to do me a favor.


277
00:13:00.670 --> 00:13:01.470
你 让我 帮你忙？
You want a favor from me?


278
00:13:01.630 --> 00:13:03.330
是的
Yes.


279
00:13:03.340 --> 00:13:05.840
就让我和你一起 玩一天
Just let me hang out with you for one day.


280
00:13:05.840 --> 00:13:07.670
我就可以跟我妈说 我们确实一起玩了
I could tell my mom we hung out


281
00:13:07.670 --> 00:13:09.970
然后我们就可以各走各的路了
and then we'll just be out of each other's lives.


282
00:13:10.570 --> 00:13:11.740
说定了？
Deal?


283
00:13:13.840 --> 00:13:14.840
说定了
Deal.


284
00:13:15.480 --> 00:13:17.340
保证
Word.


285
00:13:17.350 --> 00:13:19.780
你是在做黑魔法手势吗？
Is that a Black Power salute?


286
00:13:19.780 --> 00:13:21.550
不是 我想击拳来着
No, I was going in for a fist bump.


287
00:13:21.550 --> 00:13:22.680
我离你这么远 怎么击拳啊
I can't fist bump you from up here.


288
00:13:22.680 --> 00:13:24.550
是 我才想到
Yeah, I realize that.


289
00:13:40.300 --> 00:13:41.360
好多书哦
Books.


290
00:13:41.970 --> 00:13:42.930
不错
Nice.


291
00:13:46.800 --> 00:13:47.840
还有...
And, uh...


292
00:13:49.540 --> 00:13:50.840
...树图案墙纸
...tree wallpaper.


293
00:13:51.810 --> 00:13:52.940
挺好
That's good.


294
00:13:53.510 --> 00:13:54.410
为啥？
Why?


295
00:13:55.510 --> 00:13:56.510
我也不知道
I don't know.


296
00:14:10.330 --> 00:14:14.300
失败的友谊：第一天

297
00:14:24.400 --> 00:14:25.800
这里好多枕头哦
There's a lot of pillows in here.


298
00:14:27.640 --> 00:14:29.870
嗯哼
Mmm-hmm.


299
00:14:29.870 --> 00:14:32.910
真心的 你有多少个枕头啊
Seriously, like, how many... how many pillows is that?


300
00:14:34.280 --> 00:14:35.380
我也不知道
I don't know.


301
00:14:36.480 --> 00:14:38.650
要是我有这么多枕头就好了
I wish I had that many pillows.


302
00:14:38.650 --> 00:14:42.420
跟你爸妈要啊
So, ask your parents for some.


303
00:14:42.420 --> 00:14:44.750
不 他们会起疑心的
No, they'd be suspicious or something.


304
00:14:46.120 --> 00:14:48.090
什么疑心 会怕你睡成一头死猪吗？
What, that you'd sleep all the time?


305
00:14:48.090 --> 00:14:50.090
不是 大概会怕我
No. Probably assume


306
00:14:50.090 --> 00:14:51.720
撸得枕头上到处都是
I was gonna masturbate all over them.


307
00:14:53.030 --> 00:14:55.030
他们总是把我想得很恶心
They just have some gross ideas about me.


308
00:14:55.030 --> 00:14:55.860
不过不是我的原因啦
But that's on them.


309
00:14:57.700 --> 00:14:59.630
他们总买那种性感的枕头
They're always getting sexy pillows.


310
00:15:01.600 --> 00:15:02.930
这个枕头真舒服
This is a nice pillow.


311
00:15:02.930 --> 00:15:04.070
这个枕头很明显是个男的
This pillow is a dude, obviously...


312
00:15:04.070 --> 00:15:05.600
...不过它倒是令我想起
...but it reminds me of this pillow


313
00:15:05.600 --> 00:15:07.500
我家一个叫做Francesca的枕头
we used to have named Francesca.


314
00:15:07.500 --> 00:15:09.040
它们颜色差不多
They have a similar coloring.


315
00:15:09.040 --> 00:15:10.900
不过最后Francesca被送人了
Anyway, Francesca, we had to eventually


316
00:15:10.910 --> 00:15:13.140
因为我们俩之间...
give away because in the end...


317
00:15:13.140 --> 00:15:15.440
真的挺成问题
...that whole situation was just a real problem.


318
00:15:15.440 --> 00:15:17.040
真是一团糟
It was a mess.


319
00:15:17.040 --> 00:15:19.480
我们之间有一种
There was a real chemistry


320
00:15:19.480 --> 00:15:21.640
毋庸置疑的化学反应
between us both that I think no one could deny.


321
00:15:22.850 --> 00:15:24.710
我明白 世俗并不能接受我们
I know the world may have thought it was wrong...


322
00:15:24.720 --> 00:15:27.550
但是我个人觉得 世俗才是错误的
...but I think, personally, the world was wrong...


323
00:15:27.550 --> 00:15:29.450
一个枕头 是可以和
...about what could be between...


324
00:15:30.790 --> 00:15:32.990
一个男孩
...a pillow, and a boy...


325
00:15:34.050 --> 00:15:35.550
...不是 是男人 有化学反应的
...who became a man.


326
00:15:39.630 --> 00:15:40.890
爱啥啥吧 我只是
Or whatever. I'm just...


327
00:15:41.760 --> 00:15:43.690
想说点搞笑的
...trying to be funny.


328
00:15:43.700 --> 00:15:46.090
没有啊 你说的很好笑 谢谢
No, that was good. Thank you.


329
00:15:49.130 --> 00:15:50.160
该死
Oh, shit.


330
00:15:54.570 --> 00:15:56.540
你个傻逼死哪去了 我把你那份鱿鱼也吃噜* 我真得走了
I actually have to go.


331
00:15:56.540 --> 00:15:58.470
没事 谁给你打电话啊？
That's okay. Who was that?


332
00:15:58.470 --> 00:16:00.940
对不起 呃 是Earl
Sorry. Uh, that was Earl.


333
00:16:00.940 --> 00:16:01.810
谁是Earl?
Oh, who's Earl?


334
00:16:03.810 --> 00:16:05.540
你可能还记得 15分钟前我提到过Earl
You may remember Earl from 15 minutes ago.


335
00:16:05.550 --> 00:16:07.050
女人啊
Titties.


336
00:16:07.050 --> 00:16:08.980
是这样 大家都认为 Earl是我的朋友
So, some people think Earl is my friend,


337
00:16:08.980 --> 00:16:10.180
但其实他不是的
but he's really not.


338
00:16:10.180 --> 00:16:12.080
他更像是我的同事
He's more like a coworker.


339
00:16:12.080 --> 00:16:13.720
打幼儿园起我就认识他
I've known him since kindergarten.


340
00:16:13.720 --> 00:16:16.090
他家和我家离得很近
His house is a short walk from mine,


341
00:16:16.090 --> 00:16:18.050
但是他家邻居更可怕些
but in a much tougher neighborhood.


342
00:16:18.060 --> 00:16:21.520
他爸在得州 妈是个抑郁症 天天窝在家里
His dad is in Texas, his mom is a depressed shut-in.


343
00:16:21.530 --> 00:16:23.560
他哥Derrick有条狗Doopie
And his brother Derrick's dog Doopie


344
00:16:23.560 --> 00:16:25.560
总有一天我得 让狗活吃了
will definitely eat me someday.


345
00:16:27.530 --> 00:16:29.100
Doopie 冷静！
Doopie, Doopie, chill!


346
00:16:34.640 --> 00:16:37.500
所以这么些年来 我们都在我家玩
So over the years we've mostly hung out at my place.


347
00:16:37.500 --> 00:16:40.770
一般都是跟我爸一起 他是终身社会学教授
Usually with my dad, a tenured sociology professor.


348
00:16:40.770 --> 00:16:43.010
你多厉害啊 猫子 想打架吗？
What you got, cat? You wanna fight?


349
00:16:43.010 --> 00:16:45.610
猜你也不敢吧 傻逼猫
Didn't think so, punk-ass cat.


350
00:16:45.610 --> 00:16:47.480
- 孩子们 -  他的工作特性使得他
- Boys! - His job allows him


351
00:16:47.480 --> 00:16:48.980
可以一直宅家 啥也不干
to be frequently at home doing nothing.


352
00:16:48.980 --> 00:16:51.010
你们一定会对这个感兴趣
You'll want to pay close attention to this.


353
00:16:51.010 --> 00:16:54.020
疯狂的征服者阿基尔
The insane conquistador, Aguirre,


354
00:16:54.020 --> 00:16:55.680
正满腔怒火地穿过丛林
is raging through the jungle...


355
00:16:55.690 --> 00:16:58.250
寻找并不存在的黄金城
...in search of a golden city that doesn't exist.


356
00:16:58.250 --> 00:16:59.950
《阿基尔 上帝的愤怒》
The wrath of God.


357
00:16:59.960 --> 00:17:02.690
外语片经典啊
It's a classic of foreign cinema.


358
00:17:02.690 --> 00:17:04.190
谁跟我一起去？
Who else is with me?


359
00:17:05.860 --> 00:17:07.190
除了最经典的佳片之外
In addition to the best films...


360
00:17:07.190 --> 00:17:08.890
这是乌贼
This is cuttlefish.


361
00:17:08.900 --> 00:17:10.730
我家还有最奇怪的食物
...my house also has the weirdest food.


362
00:17:10.730 --> 00:17:12.730
是一种很像鱿鱼的海洋生物
A sea creature much like a squid.


363
00:17:12.730 --> 00:17:15.270
这是东亚地区最受欢迎的小吃
It is a favorite East Asian snack food.


364
00:17:15.270 --> 00:17:17.570
很显然 我们的生活背景不尽相同
Obviously we come from pretty different backgrounds.


365
00:17:17.570 --> 00:17:19.870
但不知怎的 我们的爱好却很相似
But somehow, we like most of the same things.


366
00:17:19.870 --> 00:17:22.610
好吧 但是对于我们西方人来说
Yes, its smell is odd and repellent


367
00:17:22.610 --> 00:17:24.070
闻起来又怪又恶心
to our Western noses.


368
00:17:24.080 --> 00:17:26.580
而且 我们很早就意识到
And we learned pretty early on


369
00:17:26.580 --> 00:17:28.040
我俩是唯一喜欢...
that we were the only ones who liked...


370
00:17:28.050 --> 00:17:30.810
经典外语片的
...for example, classics of foreign cinema.


371
00:17:32.580 --> 00:17:34.050
我们为什么喜欢？
Why did we like them?


372
00:17:34.050 --> 00:17:36.050
这很难说
It's hard to say.


373
00:17:36.050 --> 00:17:37.790
可能是因为它们怪怪的 而且通常很暴力
Maybe it's that they were weird and often violent,


374
00:17:37.790 --> 00:17:39.720
就像我们一样
like us.


375
00:17:39.720 --> 00:17:42.220
或者有时很难理解 或者毫无意义 就像生活
Or confusing and possibly meaningless, like life.


376
00:17:42.220 --> 00:17:44.860
你逃不出这个 臭烘烘的营地
You can't escape of this stinkin' camp


377
00:17:44.860 --> 00:17:46.060
因为这里屁也没有 电话都接不到
because you never know when they call you.


378
00:17:46.060 --> 00:17:49.530
因为你拿了钱了 你签了合同了
Because you're paid for, you're under contract.


379
00:17:51.970 --> 00:17:54.000
反正吧 我们对外语片的爱过于疯狂
Anyway, we liked them so much


380
00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:54.870
所以也开始拍自己的小电影了
we started making our own.


381
00:17:56.070 --> 00:17:57.730
Greg和Earl制片 开拍！
Action!


382
00:17:57.740 --> 00:17:59.600
每个小电影的概念都是
The idea behind each one was...


383
00:17:59.600 --> 00:18:00.700
我们选一部我们喜欢的电影
...we took a film that we liked


384
00:18:00.710 --> 00:18:02.200
把标题改得更蠢一点
and made the title stupider.


385
00:18:02.210 --> 00:18:03.770
（恶搞电影标题《老年凯恩》《大开屁戒》 《罗丝玛丽的萝卜》《四百兄》《诺斯鼻拉图2》） 再拍成一部新的电影
And then made a new film


386
00:18:03.770 --> 00:18:05.610
（恶搞电影标题《老年凯恩》《大开屁戒》 《罗丝玛丽的萝卜》《四百兄》《诺斯鼻拉图2》） 来讲述这更蠢的题目
to reflect the new stupid title.


387
00:18:05.610 --> 00:18:07.610
（《吃货八部半》《狗屎男》《疯狂之鞋》 《剖析汉堡》《迷路记》很多谐音和文字游戏大家自己理解下） 这种拍电影的方式 简直就是烂片制造机
It's a formula that only produces horrible films...


388
00:18:07.610 --> 00:18:10.110
（《吃货八部半》《狗屎男》《疯狂之鞋》 《剖析汉堡》《迷路记》很多谐音和文字游戏大家自己理解下） 但不知为何 我们却一直保持这个传统
...but for some reason we keep using it.


389
00:18:10.520 --> 00:18:12.720
《与巨人安德烈的晚餐》

390
00:18:13.320 --> 00:18:16.520
《毫无诱惑》（她是塑料人）

391
00:18:17.820 --> 00:18:22.120
《精疲力尽之哮喘》

392
00:18:22.220 --> 00:18:25.720
《多毛老年现代三镖客》

393
00:18:26.020 --> 00:18:30.720
《威尼斯疑魂之有个小丑要杀了你 靠》

394
00:18:31.220 --> 00:18:36.020
《第七海豹印》

395
00:18:37.020 --> 00:18:40.720
《拉屎狂》

396
00:18:41.220 --> 00:18:45.920
《疯狂荒岛惊魂》 “影评人：比《穷街陋巷》还要出色！”

397
00:18:47.220 --> 00:18:52.720
《网球之死》

398
00:18:53.320 --> 00:18:55.720
我们拍了42部电影
We've made 42 films.


399
00:18:55.720 --> 00:18:57.290
你可能觉得 我们是时候停止毁片了
You'd think we'd have stopped making them by now.


400
00:18:57.290 --> 00:18:59.190
但我们没有
But we haven't.


401
00:18:59.190 --> 00:19:00.920
《尖叫的负担》图注：*大船* *疯子演员* *导演* 其实 事实是 我们也不知道我们还能干什么
Honestly, it's like you can't go anywhere.


402
00:19:00.920 --> 00:19:03.720
《尖叫的负担》图注：*大船* *疯子演员* *导演* 你不可能从这 他妈的臭烘烘的地方逃离的
You can't escape this stinking place...


403
00:19:03.730 --> 00:19:05.330
因为这儿屁都没有 打个电话都接不到
...because you don't know when they call you...


404
00:19:05.330 --> 00:19:09.030
你是拿了钱签了合同的 简直他妈狗屁
and you're paid to be here, it's bullshit.


405
00:19:09.030 --> 00:19:10.930
就这事 就这样
Yeah, and it's like, you know,


406
00:19:10.930 --> 00:19:13.100
我啥都不能干 好像被囚禁
I can't do anything. I'm not a free person.


407
00:19:13.100 --> 00:19:16.900
讲真 你们的作品中 我最喜欢这部
Truly, one of my favorites from your oeuvre.


408
00:19:16.900 --> 00:19:19.740
对于自然暴力的探讨的成熟视角
A mature investigation into the nature of violence.


409
00:19:19.740 --> 00:19:22.040
爸 我都说了130亿遍了
Dad, for like the billionth time,


410
00:19:22.040 --> 00:19:23.270
你不许看我们的小电影
you're not allowed to watch these.


411
00:19:24.270 --> 00:19:25.940
我是粉丝啊
I'm a fan.


412
00:19:28.040 --> 00:19:29.780
你还去见那个姑娘吗？
You gonna go see that girl again?


413
00:19:31.110 --> 00:19:33.680
呃 可能吧
I mean, probably, yeah.


414
00:19:33.680 --> 00:19:35.120
你跟她玩爱爱么？
You gonna play with them titties?


415
00:19:35.120 --> 00:19:37.850
不 我们不是那个关系
No. It's not like that.


416
00:19:37.850 --> 00:19:39.190
啊 那怎么行
Well, that's not right.


417
00:19:39.190 --> 00:19:40.820
我是说 这可能是这姑娘一生中
I mean, this could be her last chance on Earth


418
00:19:40.820 --> 00:19:42.150
最后一次和男人共处的机会
to be with a man.


419
00:19:42.160 --> 00:19:43.620
别只想着自己
Don't make this about you.


420
00:19:43.620 --> 00:19:44.360
Earl!
Earl!


421
00:19:45.820 --> 00:19:47.860
首先 那么高风险
First of all, if it's that high-stakes,


422
00:19:47.860 --> 00:19:49.360
我连勃起都不可能
probably won't even be able to get a boner.


423
00:19:50.730 --> 00:19:52.860
我没说勃起吧？
Did I even say shit about boners?


424
00:19:52.860 --> 00:19:55.060
没
No.


425
00:19:55.070 --> 00:19:58.670
话说回来 这急性髓细胞性白血病 到底是什么癌症啊
What kind of cancer even is acute myelogenous leukemia?


426
00:19:59.800 --> 00:20:02.040
呃 就是...
You know, cancer of the, uh...


427
00:20:03.170 --> 00:20:04.700
...就是癌症嘛
...the thing.


428
00:20:06.210 --> 00:20:08.310
全是狗屁！
It's bullshit!


429
00:20:08.310 --> 00:20:11.380
安提塔姆会战是美国历史上
The Battle of Antietam was the bloodiest day


430
00:20:11.380 --> 00:20:12.110
最血腥的一天
in American history.


431
00:20:12.110 --> 00:20:15.180
同学们 你们有什么要说的？
Class, what do you have to say for yourselves?


432
00:20:15.180 --> 00:20:16.080
尊重研究
Respect the research.


433
00:20:17.420 --> 00:20:19.880
这才对嘛！
That is what I'm talking about!


434
00:20:19.880 --> 00:20:21.680
好吧 逃命吧 快逃吧
All right, run for your lives.


435
00:20:21.690 --> 00:20:23.220
保命重要 走吧走吧
Save yourselves. Go, go, go, go, go.


436
00:20:24.020 --> 00:20:26.190
今天大家都干得不错
Good work today, everybody.


437
00:20:26.190 --> 00:20:29.020
加油 做得很好
Way to go. Bam. Love it. Good stuff.


438
00:20:29.020 --> 00:20:30.960
干得好 棒极了
Good job. Excellent work today.


439
00:20:30.960 --> 00:20:32.890
棒极了 嘿 能跟你谈谈吗？
Excellent. Nice job. Hey, can I talk to you?


440
00:20:32.890 --> 00:20:33.890
就一会儿 可以吗?
Can I talk to you for a second?


441
00:20:33.890 --> 00:20:35.960
可以啊 Greg 怎么了？
Sure, Greg, what's up?


442
00:20:35.960 --> 00:20:39.430
你了解白血病吗？
Uh, do you know any facts about leukemia?


443
00:20:39.430 --> 00:20:41.130
白血病？
Leukemia?


444
00:20:41.130 --> 00:20:45.200
哦 是一种血液和骨髓的癌症
Yeah, it's a cancer of the blood and/or bone marrow.


445
00:20:45.370 --> 00:20:47.070
为什么想知道？
Why?


446
00:20:47.070 --> 00:20:49.340
所以这种病症会蔓延全身？
Right, so it's pretty spread out in the body?


447
00:20:49.340 --> 00:20:51.170
是的 这是个事实
That is a fact, yes.


448
00:20:51.170 --> 00:20:53.810
一般得了这病 多久会死？
How soon do people die from it?


449
00:20:53.810 --> 00:20:55.370
我认为这病是可治疗的
I think it's often pretty treatable, bud.


450
00:20:55.380 --> 00:20:57.040
为什么问我这个？
Why do you ask?


451
00:20:57.040 --> 00:20:59.980
呃 你知道Rachel Kushner 得了白血病是吧？
Well, you know Rachel Kushner has leukemia, right?


452
00:20:59.980 --> 00:21:01.080
等等 Rachel怎么了？
Wait, Rachel has what?


453
00:21:02.110 --> 00:21:04.010
我真的是蠢出新高度了
I'm, like, innovatively stupid.


454
00:21:05.980 --> 00:21:08.450
反正大家早晚都会知道的
Everyone was gonna find out sooner or later.


455
00:21:08.450 --> 00:21:10.790
我只是讨厌把自己的事情跟大家分享
Just hate having to share everything about myself.


456
00:21:10.790 --> 00:21:11.820
我也是 完全一样的想法
I'm the exact same way.


457
00:21:12.720 --> 00:21:14.850
你知道吗 如果你不想跟任何人说话
You know, one thing you can do


458
00:21:14.860 --> 00:21:16.120
那你可以
if you don't want to talk to anyone...


459
00:21:16.120 --> 00:21:17.420
进入一种非人的状态
...is just enter a subhuman state.


460
00:21:20.160 --> 00:21:21.430
就这样 你先假装是一个特别烦的人
Here, pretend you're someone annoying.


461
00:21:29.470 --> 00:21:30.970
"嗨 Rachel
"Hi, Rachel.


462
00:21:30.970 --> 00:21:32.100
"真抱歉你得癌症了"
"I'm really sorry you have cancer."


463
00:21:46.280 --> 00:21:47.250
真的有用吗？
Does that ever work?


464
00:21:47.250 --> 00:21:51.250
真的 超级管用
Yeah, of course. It works all the time.


465
00:21:51.250 --> 00:21:53.490
这叫做 消极抵抗
It's called passive resistance.


466
00:21:53.490 --> 00:21:55.950
就是甘地搞运动的时候那一套
You know, that's what Gandhi was all about.


467
00:21:55.960 --> 00:21:57.790
我并不觉得甘地这样过
I'm pretty sure Gandhi never did the subhuman thing.


468
00:22:01.060 --> 00:22:03.890
印度就是这样独立的 来嘛 试一下
That's how India achieved statehood. Here, try it.


469
00:22:07.430 --> 00:22:08.930
不要
Nope.


470
00:22:08.930 --> 00:22:09.930
来嘛 很简单的
Come on, it's easy.


471
00:22:12.500 --> 00:22:15.300
好吧 还有一种方法
Okay. Or another thing you can do is just


472
00:22:15.310 --> 00:22:16.800
挺尸 装死
flat-out pretend to be dead.


473
00:22:18.210 --> 00:22:19.940
快 说点什么烦我的事
Say something annoying to me.
Um...


474
00:22:22.840 --> 00:22:24.910
"嗨 Rachel 我只希望你明白
"Hey, Rachel. I just want you to remember


475
00:22:24.910 --> 00:22:26.880
"癌症也是上帝对你的安排"
"that your cancer is all part of God's plan."


476
00:22:33.520 --> 00:22:35.250
你个混蛋
Hey, asshole.


477
00:22:35.260 --> 00:22:36.590
过来
Yeah, over here.


478
00:22:37.620 --> 00:22:39.220
我们说清楚
Just so we're straight on this,


479
00:22:39.220 --> 00:22:40.920
你在建议一个患癌少女
you're advising a girl with cancer...


480
00:22:40.930 --> 00:22:42.930
装 死
...to pretend to be dead.


481
00:22:44.130 --> 00:22:45.560
说真的
No, seriously.


482
00:22:45.560 --> 00:22:47.500
你个混球 用用脑子
Think about what you're doing here, dickhead.


483
00:22:47.500 --> 00:22:49.130
我在这个少女的墙壁上 摆一张
I've been doing my broody Wolverine face on


484
00:22:49.130 --> 00:22:50.430
金刚狼脸
this girl's wall...


485
00:22:50.430 --> 00:22:52.270
已经有五又四分之一年了
...for five and a quarter years,


486
00:22:52.270 --> 00:22:53.570
此时 我还被挂着的原因...
and at this point, I'm probably only still here...


487
00:22:53.570 --> 00:22:55.200
可能是如果把我摘下来的话
...because she'd feel weirdly guilty


488
00:22:55.200 --> 00:22:56.900
她会感到罪恶和不忠
or disloyal taking me down.


489
00:22:56.900 --> 00:22:58.500
但是如果我让一个像你这样的傻瓜
But I'm goddamned if I'm letting


490
00:22:58.500 --> 00:23:00.040
走进来 说些奇奇怪怪的蠢话
a little punk like you waltz in here...


491
00:23:00.040 --> 00:23:01.340
我就跳墙谢罪！
...stupiding up the place!


492
00:23:01.340 --> 00:23:02.570
至少我在这儿时不行
Not on my watch, pal.


493
00:23:02.570 --> 00:23:03.610
Greg 你怎么了？
Greg, what's wrong?


494
00:23:06.110 --> 00:23:07.410
我真心道歉
I'm really sorry.


495
00:23:09.140 --> 00:23:10.910
我不应该让你装死
I shouldn't have told you to pretend to be dead.


496
00:23:10.910 --> 00:23:12.350
我说话太不小心了
That was really insensitive.


497
00:23:13.650 --> 00:23:15.380
但是 我只是生病啊 又不是要死了
I mean, I'm sick. I'm not dying.


498
00:23:15.380 --> 00:23:17.620
是的 我懂 我只是...
Yeah, I know, but I just...


499
00:23:17.620 --> 00:23:19.880
觉得这样怪怪的
Now I'm being all weird about it.


500
00:23:19.890 --> 00:23:22.220
而且我没法觉得这样正常 因为
And I can't get un-weird, 'cause I just...


501
00:23:22.220 --> 00:23:23.650
虽然你那么说了
Despite what you said,


502
00:23:23.660 --> 00:23:25.490
但是我坐在这儿脑子里想的
I'm clearly still sitting here thinking...


503
00:23:25.490 --> 00:23:26.660
全是"死亡 死亡 死亡 死亡 死亡"
..."death, death, death, death, death, death."


504
00:23:39.670 --> 00:23:42.140
对对对！就这样！
That's exactly what I'm talking about!


505
00:23:44.600 --> 00:23:47.070
就这样 如果这是个浪漫的琼瑶故事的话
So if this was a touching romantic story...


506
00:23:47.070 --> 00:23:48.310
现在我就会
...this is probably where a new feeling


507
00:23:48.310 --> 00:23:49.510
感觉被一种焕然一新的情感包围
would wash over me...


508
00:23:49.510 --> 00:23:52.910
我们目光相遇 开始疯狂亲热
and suddenly we would be furiously making out...


509
00:23:52.910 --> 00:23:54.080
干柴烈火 星月同辉
...with the fire of a thousand suns.


510
00:23:59.280 --> 00:24:01.280
但这不是个浪漫的琼瑶故事
But this isn't a touching romantic story.


511
00:24:01.290 --> 00:24:03.220
爱谁谁吧 是
Anyway... Yep.


512
00:24:03.220 --> 00:24:04.990
但我们确实成为了朋友
But we did still become friends.


513
00:24:05.560 --> 00:24:11.960
我和Rachel是这么变成朋友的 别名：没有回头路

514
00:24:12.560 --> 00:24:14.960
失败的友谊：第四天 Daniel Craig的问题是 他口音太重了
Daniel Craig's thing is, he's got an accent, right?


515
00:24:14.960 --> 00:24:17.700
所以他说话时 嘴型很奇怪
So he's used to talking with his mouth in a weird shape...


516
00:24:17.700 --> 00:24:20.100
噘着嘴 像个女的
...which is why he has pouty lips, like a woman.


517
00:24:20.100 --> 00:24:22.970
失败的友谊：第七日 希望有人可以发明舔屏功能 这样我就可以给你发张三明治图片 你就可以吃了
Lickable technology, like, I could text you a sandwich.


518
00:24:22.970 --> 00:24:27.170
希望这是手机未来的发展方向 - 在皮肤下面 他的后脖颈上有个按钮
There's a button on the nape of his neck, under the skin.


519
00:24:27.180 --> 00:24:29.510
按一下 他就停了
Just push it if you want him to stop.


520
00:24:29.510 --> 00:24:31.580
失败的友谊：第八天 你相信吗 在我们家 动物和人一起住在家里
Do you believe animals just live in our house,


521
00:24:31.580 --> 00:24:33.280
而且大家都觉得没什么?
and everyone's cool with it?


522
00:24:33.280 --> 00:24:35.180
是活的动物哦
Like, real animals?


523
00:24:35.180 --> 00:24:37.280
爱谁谁吧 该你说了
Anyway. You talk now.


524
00:24:38.050 --> 00:24:40.120
你是说 让我说癌症吗？
You mean, talk about cancer?


525
00:24:40.120 --> 00:24:42.550
你想的话 可以啊
Only if you want to.


526
00:24:42.550 --> 00:24:44.220
我最难受的大概就是看我妈妈
The hardest part is watching my mom


527
00:24:44.220 --> 00:24:47.220
试图承受这一切
trying to deal with it all.


528
00:24:47.220 --> 00:24:48.960
而且有的时候我真的会想 万一
And sometimes, I mean, I do think if it ends up


529
00:24:48.960 --> 00:24:51.260
我真的不在了 只剩她孤身一人
that she's alone in that house...


530
00:24:51.260 --> 00:24:52.990
她就谁也没有了 她跟我爸彼此憎恨
She has no one. She and my dad hate each other.


531
00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:54.490
他也没什么姐妹
She has no siblings.


532
00:24:54.500 --> 00:24:56.030
我不知道他该怎么办
I don't know what she'd do.


533
00:24:58.260 --> 00:24:59.630
不要哭
Don't cry.


534
00:24:59.630 --> 00:25:02.230
我没哭
I'm not crying.


535
00:25:02.240 --> 00:25:04.440
哦 也是 不过你想哭的话 可以哭
Right, well, you know, you can cry if you need to.


536
00:25:04.440 --> 00:25:06.100
你刚才不是说“不要哭”吗
I thought you said, "Don't cry."


537
00:25:09.270 --> 00:25:10.640
我和我爸以前会在街区散步
Me and my dad used to walk around the block


538
00:25:10.640 --> 00:25:13.180
一起数松鼠
and count squirrels.


539
00:25:13.180 --> 00:25:15.110
为什么？他在什么松鼠人口普查部门工作吗
Why? Did he work for, like, the squirrel census?


540
00:25:15.110 --> 00:25:16.510
没有啦 我们只是在一起的时候
No, it was just something we did


541
00:25:16.510 --> 00:25:18.750
会找点事做
when it was time for us to spend time together.


542
00:25:18.750 --> 00:25:20.180
我们数的时候甚至都不跟彼此聊天
We didn't even say anything while we did it.


543
00:25:20.180 --> 00:25:22.150
就说数字:
All we'd say was stuff like:


544
00:25:22.150 --> 00:25:25.180
"7只松鼠" "又两只 9只"
"Squirrel, seven." "Two squirrels, nine."


545
00:25:25.190 --> 00:25:28.990
天啊 你该立刻申请个爸爸偿还基金
Jesus. You need to apply for a dad refund immediately.


546
00:25:28.990 --> 00:25:30.020
我是哪个团体的？
What group am I in?


547
00:25:30.020 --> 00:25:31.490
啥？
What?


548
00:25:31.490 --> 00:25:33.190
你昨天不是说 你根据团体
Yesterday you were saying you'd mapped out


549
00:25:33.190 --> 00:25:34.320
划分了整个学校吗？
the entire high school by group.


550
00:25:34.330 --> 00:25:35.730
我是哪个团体的？
What's my group?


551
00:25:35.730 --> 00:25:38.060
- 你认真的？ 是啊
Seriously? Yeah.


552
00:25:38.060 --> 00:25:41.330
无聊的犹太高三女生小团体2-A
Boring Jewish Senior Girls, Subgroup 2-A.


553
00:25:42.700 --> 00:25:44.230
求你欣赏一下我刚刚有多诚实吧
Please appreciate how honest I was just now.


554
00:25:44.230 --> 00:25:45.070
你真是个混蛋
You're an asshole.


555
00:25:46.230 --> 00:25:48.370
经典电影* 你是哪个团体的？
What group are you in?


556
00:25:48.370 --> 00:25:51.540
我没有加入任何团体
Uh, I'm not in a group, actually.


557
00:25:51.540 --> 00:25:54.170
反正不逊的团体我都加入不起
I just wouldn't belong to a group that doesn't suck.


558
00:25:55.140 --> 00:25:57.770
你知道的 我总是超囧
You know, I'm terminally awkward


559
00:25:57.780 --> 00:25:59.510
丑得像只土拨鼠
and I have a face like a little groundhog.


560
00:25:59.510 --> 00:26:00.780
所以...
So...


561
00:26:00.780 --> 00:26:02.480
你不该这么想的
You can't really think that.


562
00:26:03.340 --> 00:26:05.180
不啊 我不是要这么想
No, I don't think that.


563
00:26:05.180 --> 00:26:07.310
我这叫有自知之明
I know that.


564
00:26:07.320 --> 00:26:10.420
我只是觉得 像我这样的孩子
I just feel like, you know, for a kid like me...


565
00:26:11.790 --> 00:26:15.120
在高中 为了生存
...in high school, best case scenario,


566
00:26:15.120 --> 00:26:16.790
这是最好的模式，明白？
just... survive. You know?


567
00:26:16.790 --> 00:26:19.760
不去招惹天敌
Survive without creating any mortal enemies...


568
00:26:19.760 --> 00:26:22.190
或者干点什么丢人事被人记一辈子
...or hideously embarrassing yourself forever.


569
00:26:22.190 --> 00:26:24.630
只是在大学前这样吗?
Just survive until college?


570
00:26:24.630 --> 00:26:27.430
大学? 不 老天 大学会更糟
College? No. God, college is going to be even worse.


571
00:26:27.660 --> 00:26:29.430
什么?
What?


572
00:26:29.430 --> 00:26:32.170
我是说 至少 高中三点就放学了
I mean, at least high school, it's over at 3:00...


573
00:26:32.170 --> 00:26:35.300
而且现在想想 大家都是未成年人 而且都认识
...and it's kids I mostly know by now.


574
00:26:35.300 --> 00:26:37.170
但是大学 完全是无止境地 每天遭遇陌生人
But college is just gonna be non-stop strangers.


575
00:26:37.170 --> 00:26:38.670
有些陌生人甚至要跟你住一个寝室
And some of them even live in your room.


576
00:26:38.670 --> 00:26:41.210
就意味着你永远都无法放松
It's like you can literally never relax.


577
00:26:41.210 --> 00:26:43.470
我都能预见到 不到两周 我可能就会被恐慌压死了
I see myself dying of a panic attack two weeks in.


578
00:26:44.410 --> 00:26:46.480
所以我可能不上大学了
I might just not apply.


579
00:26:46.480 --> 00:26:49.150
这是我听过的你说的最傻的话
That's the dumbest thing I've ever heard you say.


580
00:26:49.150 --> 00:26:51.150
没有吧 我觉得最傻前五都排不上
It's probably not even top five.


581
00:26:52.320 --> 00:26:55.320
而且你看 不管是高中还是大学
And, you know, high school, college,


582
00:26:55.320 --> 00:26:56.620
我们被迫浪费生命中的这么多年
we're forced to spend these years of our lives...


583
00:26:56.620 --> 00:26:58.650
与随机的 全无共同点的这么多人
...in randomly selected groups of people


584
00:26:58.660 --> 00:27:00.390
生活在一起
that we have nothing in common with.


585
00:27:00.390 --> 00:27:01.620
简直是一场噩梦
It's a nightmare.


586
00:27:02.660 --> 00:27:04.660
不这么说的人 都是骗子
Anyone who says otherwise is lying.


587
00:27:06.230 --> 00:27:07.560
恭喜你 Greg
Congratulations, Greg.


588
00:27:07.560 --> 00:27:08.730
明天 你将和无聊的犹太高三女生小团体2-A
Tomorrow, you're eating lunch with


589
00:27:08.730 --> 00:27:11.260
一起吃中饭
Boring Jewish Senior Girls, Subgroup 2-A.


590
00:27:15.130 --> 00:27:16.200
你一般都坐哪儿?
So where do you usually sit?


591
00:27:19.070 --> 00:27:21.200
这真跟在坎大哈吃中午饭没啥区别
It's literally like we're trying to have lunch in Kandahar.


592
00:27:25.370 --> 00:27:28.410
Rachel 我们刚刚想好了今年舞会的主题
Rachel, we just found out the theme for this year's prom:


593
00:27:28.410 --> 00:27:30.380
"骑士难忘夜"
"A Knight to Remember."


594
00:27:30.380 --> 00:27:32.380
加个K 变成骑士 中世纪主题哦
Knight with a "K." Medieval prom!


595
00:27:32.380 --> 00:27:34.580
舞会不是还有6个月才到吗
Isn't prom like six months away?


596
00:27:34.580 --> 00:27:35.750
大家好 这是Greg
Hi, guys. This is Greg,


597
00:27:35.750 --> 00:27:37.750
他今天和我们一起吃饭
he's gonna be sitting with us today.


598
00:27:37.750 --> 00:27:40.280
有人要勺子吗?
Anybody need any spoons? No?


599
00:27:42.550 --> 00:27:43.620
哈啰
Hello.


600
00:27:46.090 --> 00:27:48.720
Greg 你今天为什么跟我们一起吃饭？
So, Greg, why are you sitting with us today?


601
00:27:48.730 --> 00:27:51.260
那个 吃午饭嘛
You know, it's lunch.


602
00:27:51.260 --> 00:27:53.490
总得坐在什么地方吃 不能站着吃啊
You gotta eat somewhere. Can't stand and eat.


603
00:27:53.500 --> 00:27:56.430
你和Rachel怎么突然关系这么好
You and Rachel seem very friendly, all of a sudden.


604
00:27:56.600 --> 00:27:58.630
是啊
Yeah.


605
00:27:58.630 --> 00:28:00.200
你跟她聊天只是因为她得了癌症
You're only talking to her because she has cancer.


606
00:28:00.200 --> 00:28:01.630
啥?
What?


607
00:28:01.630 --> 00:28:04.100
Greg 你之前跟Rachel约会过
Greg, you hung out with Rachel once.


608
00:28:04.100 --> 00:28:05.400
你跟她作朋友只是为了让自己心里好受些
You're befriending her to feel good about yourself.


609
00:28:05.400 --> 00:28:06.800
不 不是的
No, I'm not.


610
00:28:06.810 --> 00:28:07.640
谁会这么做啊
Who even does that?


611
00:28:11.880 --> 00:28:12.670
你们介意我坐下吗？
You guys mind if I sit with you?


612
00:28:12.680 --> 00:28:13.570
当然不介意
Of course not.


613
00:28:16.480 --> 00:28:17.880
不好意思 这是...
Sorry, it's a...


614
00:28:17.880 --> 00:28:19.550
这是个枕头 其实我是拿它当婴儿啦
It's a pillow. It's meant to be a baby,


615
00:28:19.550 --> 00:28:21.380
卫生课要用
for health class.


616
00:28:21.380 --> 00:28:22.550
你觉得这玩意在这儿安全么?
You think it's safe here?


617
00:28:22.550 --> 00:28:23.580
一个枕头么?
A pillow?


618
00:28:24.820 --> 00:28:25.820
Greg 你怎么看?
Greg, what do you think?


619
00:28:26.480 --> 00:28:28.150
嗯 我不知道
Mmm, I don't know.


620
00:28:28.150 --> 00:28:29.520
反正别离我太近
Better not get it too close to me,


621
00:28:29.520 --> 00:28:31.690
不然我撸完 可能会射上去哦
otherwise I might just masturbate onto it.


622
00:28:33.260 --> 00:28:34.690
呕 Greg 你怎么这么恶心
Ew, Greg, that's just weird and gross.


623
00:28:35.860 --> 00:28:38.690
我是怎么因为纯粹的尴尬而恐慌的

624
00:28:39.660 --> 00:28:41.190
嘿 各位
Hey, everyone,


625
00:28:41.200 --> 00:28:43.430
快看Scott Mayhew的暴龙步
check out Scott Mayhew's Tyrannosaurus walk.


626
00:28:43.430 --> 00:28:45.260
这是从点A到点B的一种很好的方式！
It's a great way to get from point A to point B.


627
00:28:46.130 --> 00:28:47.500
你这样说太不好了 Greg
That was really mean, Greg.


628
00:28:47.500 --> 00:28:48.730
我觉得他听见你说的了
I think he heard you.


629
00:28:55.270 --> 00:28:56.470
就这样
And just like that...


630
00:28:58.270 --> 00:29:00.210
我八年苦心经营的隐身术
...eight years of carefully-cultivated


631
00:29:00.210 --> 00:29:02.510
就这么 没 了
invisibility... gone.


632
00:29:03.450 --> 00:29:04.410
我完了
Fin.


633
00:29:05.710 --> 00:29:07.850
你妈妈做饼干了?
Your mom made cookies?


634
00:29:07.850 --> 00:29:11.550
没有 这是我从Ill Phil的游戏中赢的
Nah, I won them off of Ill Phil in a game of tonk.


635
00:29:11.550 --> 00:29:14.720
真懒得管你去哪了
Got tired of whooping your sorry ass.


636
00:29:14.720 --> 00:29:17.260
他们干嘛要叫这个
Scholar Horizons Biology? Why do they even call it Scholar Horizons Biology?


637
00:29:17.260 --> 00:29:20.520
应该叫
Scholar Horizons Tonk Maybe they should call it Scholar Horizons Tonk.


638
00:29:20.530 --> 00:29:22.030
或者纸质橄榄球什么的
Or Sometimes Paper Football.


639
00:29:22.030 --> 00:29:23.690
小鬼们
Heathens.


640
00:29:23.700 --> 00:29:24.960
- 你们好吗？ - 嗨 McCarthy先生
What up? Hi, Mr. McCarthy.


641
00:29:26.700 --> 00:29:27.700
哇哦
Wow.


642
00:29:28.900 --> 00:29:32.700
Earl 给你说个事实 你们的午饭真是垃圾
Earl, fact, that lunch is garbage.


643
00:29:32.700 --> 00:29:35.900
你吃这个 简直就是在我们面前服毒
You're literally poisoning yourself right in front of us.


644
00:29:35.910 --> 00:29:37.670
至少我没吃奇奇怪怪的
At least I ain't eating no funky ass


645
00:29:37.670 --> 00:29:40.370
海带触手汤
seaweed-looking tentacle soup.


646
00:29:40.380 --> 00:29:43.010
讲真 这个真的很不错
Seriously, this stuff is the business.


647
00:29:43.010 --> 00:29:45.310
是越南菜 叫河粉
It's Vietnamese. It's called Pho.


648
00:29:45.310 --> 00:29:47.350
实在是“粉好吃”哦
It is "Pho-nomenal."


649
00:29:47.350 --> 00:29:48.480
那让我吃一口呗
Well, let me try some one time.


650
00:29:48.650 --> 00:29:49.610
哼
Mmm.


651
00:29:51.010 --> 00:29:52.710
- 你想吃哦? 是啊
Now you want to try some? Yeah.


652
00:29:52.720 --> 00:29:54.480
不给
Well, no.


653
00:29:54.480 --> 00:29:56.750
校规不允许我给你食物
It's strictly forbidden for me to give you food.


654
00:29:56.750 --> 00:29:57.880
不过 我推荐你去
However, if you go to...


655
00:29:59.650 --> 00:30:01.990
Lawrencewille的一家餐厅
...Thuyen's Super Saigon Flavor


656
00:30:01.990 --> 00:30:03.590
叫“涂云超级西贡风味”
over in Lawrenceville...


657
00:30:03.590 --> 00:30:05.560
就说找涂云
...and ask for Thuyen.


658
00:30:05.560 --> 00:30:08.020
跟他说 算我账上 你们可以在那儿尝尝
Tell him to put it on my tab. You'll be all set.


659
00:30:11.030 --> 00:30:13.500
我才不去什么该死的Lawrenceville.
I ain't going to no damn Lawrenceville.


660
00:30:13.500 --> 00:30:14.760
那没办法
Fair enough.


661
00:30:17.070 --> 00:30:18.730
不好意思 我要走了
You'll have to excuse me.


662
00:30:22.370 --> 00:30:23.700
孩子们
Boys.


663
00:30:23.700 --> 00:30:25.400
尊重研究
Respect the research.


664
00:30:25.410 --> 00:30:26.040
尊重!
Respect!


665
00:30:33.440 --> 00:30:34.980
天啊 你知道吗 人们都觉得
God! You know, people just assume that


666
00:30:34.980 --> 00:30:36.680
我跟Rachel在约会
Rachel and I are dating.


667
00:30:36.680 --> 00:30:38.310
简直毁了我的生活
It's ruining my life.


668
00:30:38.310 --> 00:30:40.980
我今天还威胁要性骚扰一个假婴儿
Today I threatened to sexually assault a fake baby.


669
00:30:40.980 --> 00:30:43.620
而且还跟Scott Mayhew成了天敌
And I became mortal enemies with Scott Mayhew.


670
00:30:43.620 --> 00:30:44.980
这一切都是Rachel的错
Both of which are Rachel's fault.


671
00:30:46.390 --> 00:30:48.520
我不该这么说 但确实是她的错
Sorry, but they just are.


672
00:30:48.520 --> 00:30:51.420
当然了 我这么抱怨简直是混蛋
Of course I'm a dick for complaining about it.


673
00:30:51.420 --> 00:30:53.360
我是说 我这么抱怨确实挺没品的
I mean, I am a dick for complaining about it.


674
00:30:54.360 --> 00:30:56.360
我也不是故意要这样
I didn't actually mean any of that.


675
00:30:56.360 --> 00:30:57.790
你还是跟她玩爱爱吧
Better play with them titties.


676
00:31:02.730 --> 00:31:04.400
你觉得这玩意尝起来奇怪吗？
Does this taste strange to you?


677
00:32:01.890 --> 00:32:03.550
这汤里有毒品！
The soup had drugs.


678
00:32:08.720 --> 00:32:09.760
哇！
Whoa!


679
00:32:10.720 --> 00:32:13.760
这就是我怎么不小心磕了药的

680
00:32:15.030 --> 00:32:16.560
McCarthy先生肯定往汤里放了大麻
McCarthy must've put weed in that soup


681
00:32:16.560 --> 00:32:17.860
因为我的大脑就像要吃了自己一样
because my brain is trying to eat itself.


682
00:32:17.860 --> 00:32:19.500
我的天噜
Oh, my God.


683
00:32:19.500 --> 00:32:20.860
我现在就得去见Rachel
I have to go visit Rachel right now.


684
00:32:20.870 --> 00:32:22.600
好啊 去吧
Okay, well, you do that.


685
00:32:22.600 --> 00:32:24.670
我到时候会在你家 把你爸的食物全都吃掉
I'ma be at your house eatin' up all your dad's food.


686
00:32:24.670 --> 00:32:26.500
别啊 你跟我一起来 帮帮我啊
No! You have to come help!


687
00:32:26.500 --> 00:32:27.670
帮啥？
Help with what?


688
00:32:27.670 --> 00:32:28.640
就帮我嘛！
Help!


689
00:32:31.910 --> 00:32:33.570
嘿 上课时 McCarthy老师是经常有点
Hey, in class, do McCarthy act all, like,


690
00:32:33.570 --> 00:32:34.840
疯疯癫癫像嗑了药的吧?
stoned and shit?


691
00:32:35.810 --> 00:32:37.710
呃 我也不知道 有点吧
Uh, I don't know. I guess.


692
00:32:37.710 --> 00:32:39.140
是 有时候吧
Yeah, sometimes.


693
00:32:39.140 --> 00:32:41.040
不是有时候
Well, not sometimes,


694
00:32:41.040 --> 00:32:42.540
但是你知道我... 你知道他那样子
but you know what I'm... You know how he is.


695
00:32:42.550 --> 00:32:44.610
该死 哥们
Goddamn, son.


696
00:32:44.610 --> 00:32:46.710
你连句完整话都说不出来了
You can't even put a full damn sentence together.


697
00:32:46.720 --> 00:32:49.650
McCarthy先生嗑放了药的汤 简直太疯狂了
It's insane that Mr. McCarthy eats soup with drugs in it.


698
00:32:49.650 --> 00:32:51.880
嘿 哥们 声音小点！
Hey, come on, man, keep your damn voice down.


699
00:33:04.500 --> 00:33:06.100
我们嗑了药这件事 不能告诉任何人
We can't tell anyone we're on drugs.


700
00:33:06.100 --> 00:33:07.500
为啥？
Why the hell not?


701
00:33:09.900 --> 00:33:11.670
因为他们就会知道了
Because then they'll know.


702
00:33:31.020 --> 00:33:33.790
啊 是我们的谦逊小耗子来了
It's my humble little mouse.


703
00:33:33.790 --> 00:33:35.820
小耗子的朋友又是谁?
And who is his little mouse friend?


704
00:33:37.790 --> 00:33:40.460
Earl Jackson
Earl Jackson.


705
00:33:40.460 --> 00:33:43.930
Earl只是我的同事 他人很不错
Earl's just my coworker, and, uh, he's a great guy.


706
00:33:43.930 --> 00:33:46.060
我们只是在附近散步
We were just walking around the neighborhood, you know.


707
00:33:46.070 --> 00:33:48.900
没什么别的事做
Not really doing anything,


708
00:33:48.900 --> 00:33:50.500
所以来打个招呼
and just wanted to come say "What's up?"


709
00:33:50.500 --> 00:33:52.740
因为Rachel就要剃光头发了
'Cause Rachel's about to lose her hair.


710
00:33:52.740 --> 00:33:54.200
嗯 只是过来说一句
Mmm. So, just wanted to say,


711
00:33:54.210 --> 00:33:57.840
"拜拜 头发 终于摆脱你了"
you know, "Bye, hair. Good riddance."


712
00:33:57.840 --> 00:34:00.540
她没头发的样子肯定也超美的 所以...
She's gonna look great without hair. That's a fact, so...


713
00:34:00.540 --> 00:34:02.510
嗯 就是来打个招呼
Yeah, I just wanted to say what's up.


714
00:34:02.510 --> 00:34:05.550
Rachel 你有两个可爱的谦逊小鼠朋友
Rachel! We've got two cute little mouse boys


715

716
00:34:10.550 --> 00:34:14.820

Would you two... mice like a little bit of cheese?


717
00:34:18.890 --> 00:34:19.990

谢谢 Greg总觉得太少女了
Thanks. Greg thinks it's too girly.


720
00:34:32.140 --> 00:34:34.770
没有啦 我喜欢少女 我觉得很棒
No, I love girly, I think it's fine.


721
00:34:34.770 --> 00:34:36.140
不过其实也没有很少女啦
Well, it ain't too girly.


722
00:34:36.140 --> 00:34:38.940
"哟 看 粉粉的毛绒玩意"
"Yo, this some pink puffy bullshit."


723
00:34:38.940 --> 00:34:40.670
我是说 Hello Kitty海报
I mean, Hello Kitty posters


724
00:34:40.680 --> 00:34:42.940
还有巧克力肤色裸男挂满墙
and chocolate and naked dudes all over the wall.


725
00:34:42.940 --> 00:34:45.080
真的让我想吐哦
They make me want to throw up for real.


726
00:34:45.080 --> 00:34:47.580
如果你真的想吐的话 别在这儿好么
Hey, if you're gonna throw up, don't do it in here, okay?


727
00:34:47.580 --> 00:34:48.250
这是她的房间
This is her room.


728
00:34:49.920 --> 00:34:52.020
无所谓了
Anyways.


729
00:34:52.020 --> 00:34:54.150
Rachel 我们真的想来看看你怎么样了
Rachel, we really just wanted to see how you was doin'.


730
00:34:54.720 --> 00:34:56.120
谢了
Thanks.


731
00:34:56.120 --> 00:34:58.790
是啊 化疗 感觉肯定很烂吧
Yeah, chemotherapy. That really sucks.


732
00:34:58.790 --> 00:34:59.720
Greg
Greg.


733
00:35:01.020 --> 00:35:03.960
你怎么回事啊 别说什么烂啊烂的
What the hell, bro? Don't say it suck, dumb-ass!


734
00:35:03.960 --> 00:35:05.990
确实挺烂的啊
It does kinda suck.


735
00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:07.900
是 我是说 这你也避免不了的
Yeah, but I mean, you gotta do what you gotta do.


736
00:35:07.900 --> 00:35:09.030
是吧 大概
Yeah, I guess.


737
00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:11.960
呃...
Um...


738
00:35:14.530 --> 00:35:16.070
呃...
Uh...


739
00:35:16.070 --> 00:35:17.640
你们要是不想在这儿 可以走的
Look, you guys can go if you want.


740
00:35:17.640 --> 00:35:19.140
- 我们嗑药了 - 天啊
We're on drugs. Oh, shit!


741
00:35:19.140 --> 00:35:20.840
你们为啥嗑药啊?
Why are you on drugs?


742
00:35:20.840 --> 00:35:22.210
我们不是有意的
Well, we're accidentally on drugs.


743
00:35:22.210 --> 00:35:23.710
"不是有意的"?
"Accidentally"?


744
00:35:23.710 --> 00:35:25.670
McCarthy先生给我们喝了点汤
McCarthy gave us some soup.


745
00:35:25.680 --> 00:35:27.910
是 McCarthy先生给了我们一点他的
Well, McCarthy gave us some of his,


746
00:35:27.910 --> 00:35:29.840
就是 他平常喝的 再正常不过的汤
you know, just regular, normal soup...


747
00:35:29.850 --> 00:35:30.910
但是 结果 那个汤吧不太够...
...but then, it was the last of the soup


748
00:35:30.910 --> 00:35:32.010
所以我们又去一家饭店
so we had to go get some more...


749
00:35:32.010 --> 00:35:34.080
又买了一些
...from a restaurant,


750
00:35:34.080 --> 00:35:35.850
那家饭店在一个办公楼的五楼
on the fifth floor of an office building.


751
00:35:35.850 --> 00:35:37.280
然后同时 牙买加大使馆
And in the same building,


752
00:35:37.280 --> 00:35:38.650
也在那栋楼
there was a Jamaican embassy...


753
00:35:38.650 --> 00:35:41.190
然后我们跟一个苏里南人
...and we ended up getting trapped


754
00:35:41.190 --> 00:35:42.920
被困在一间电梯里
in an elevator with a Rastafarian guy...


755
00:35:42.920 --> 00:35:45.720
...他抽烟抽得整个电梯间都是那味儿
...and he just hotboxed the whole elevator, so...


756
00:35:45.720 --> 00:35:48.260
我们被困在一起大概25分钟
We were stuck in there for, like, 25 minutes...


757
00:35:48.260 --> 00:35:49.190
...所以我们也闻了点大麻
...and we had to breathe the weird marijuana air.


758
00:35:49.190 --> 00:35:51.090
Earl 我说得对吧?
Earl, am I right?


759
00:35:51.090 --> 00:35:52.160
没错 就这样
That's exactly what happened.


760
00:35:53.330 --> 00:35:56.000
你们这一路可真是艰险
You guys had quite an adventure.


761
00:35:56.000 --> 00:35:58.630
嗑药感觉好烂啊
Being on drugs just really sucks.


762
00:35:58.630 --> 00:36:00.600
跟嗑药的人在一起感觉也好烂
Being around people on drugs sucks.


763
00:36:00.600 --> 00:36:04.070
这一切都太烂了 真抱歉
This whole situation, really sorry, just sucks. I'm sorry.


764
00:36:04.070 --> 00:36:06.640
嘿 你什么毛病啊
Yo, yo. What the hell is your problem, man?


765
00:36:06.640 --> 00:36:08.110
干嘛总对不起对不起的
All apologetic and shit,


766
00:36:08.110 --> 00:36:09.610
给你自己找借口
making shit 'bout your sorry ass.


767
00:36:09.610 --> 00:36:11.710
我们来了又不是来道歉的
Look, that's not what we came here to do. Okay?


768
00:36:11.710 --> 00:36:12.910
我们是来帮忙的 带这姑娘出门走走
You wanna help, you gonna take this girl out


769
00:36:12.910 --> 00:36:14.280
吃个冰棍
to get some ice cream.


770
00:36:15.280 --> 00:36:17.280
我也要吃 因为我喜欢吃冰棍
And me, too, 'cause I love that shit.


771
00:36:17.280 --> 00:36:18.610
你喜欢吃吗?
You like ice cream?


772
00:36:18.620 --> 00:36:20.280
喜欢
Yeah.


773
00:36:20.280 --> 00:36:21.950
那 你是从学校里认识Greg的?
So, you know Greg from class?


774
00:36:23.090 --> 00:36:25.290
我们俩从很小的时候就认识了
I've known Greg ever since we were little.


775
00:36:25.290 --> 00:36:27.020
是幼儿园就认识了吧?
You know, I was in y'all kindergarten, right?


776
00:36:27.020 --> 00:36:28.720
真的?
Really?


777
00:36:28.720 --> 00:36:30.260
嗯哼 我记得你
Mmm-hmm. I remember you.


778
00:36:30.260 --> 00:36:32.290
你是那个管Justin叫变态的姑娘
You was the girl who called Justin Jones perverted...


779
00:36:32.290 --> 00:36:34.730
就因为他给姑娘们看他屁股上的胎记
...for showing girls the birthmark on his butt.


780
00:36:34.730 --> 00:36:35.430
天啊 对的！
Oh, my God, yes!


781
00:36:36.330 --> 00:36:38.330
是啊 那家伙跑上来
Yeah, dude came running up,


782
00:36:38.330 --> 00:36:40.430
脱了裤子 你当时可冷静了
showed you his butt. You were calm.


783
00:36:40.430 --> 00:36:43.000
说 "Justin 只有变态才给人看屁股"
Said, "Justin, only perverts show their butts."


784
00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:44.200
我当时在场啊
I was right there.


785
00:36:44.200 --> 00:36:46.300
真不敢相信你还记得
I can't believe you remember that.


786
00:36:46.310 --> 00:36:49.410
你是个英雄啊 阻止了变态暴露狂
You a hero. Shut his perverted ass right down.


787
00:36:49.410 --> 00:36:50.810
我永远都不会忘
I never forget it.


788
00:36:51.840 --> 00:36:53.940
那 你和Greg是同事?
So you and Greg are coworkers?


789
00:36:53.950 --> 00:36:55.440
不 我们是朋友
Naw, we friends.


790
00:36:55.450 --> 00:36:58.050
他只是不喜欢管别人叫朋友 他这人有心理问题
He just hates calling people his friend. Dude's got issues.


791
00:36:58.050 --> 00:37:00.820
确实 怎么回事?
Yeah, he does. What's going on?


792
00:37:00.820 --> 00:37:03.220
我也不知道是为啥 可能是他家人吧
Man, I don't even know. It might be his folks.


793
00:37:03.220 --> 00:37:05.150
我是说 他妈总是跟他说
I mean, dude's mom always tellin' him


794
00:37:05.150 --> 00:37:07.290
他多帅多帅 其实他不帅
how handsome he is, which he ain't.


795
00:37:07.290 --> 00:37:09.990
所以他不相信跟他亲近的人
So now he think he can't trust anybody close to him.


796
00:37:09.990 --> 00:37:11.420
他爹是个怪咖
Dude's weird-ass dad


797
00:37:11.430 --> 00:37:13.890
不跟任何人社交 除了他家史蒂猫
don't socialize with anybody 'cept the cat.


798
00:37:13.890 --> 00:37:16.360
简直是不交朋友的楷模
So that's a role model ain't got no friends.


799
00:37:16.360 --> 00:37:18.130
总而言之 他恐惧
Bottom line, dude's terrified


800
00:37:18.130 --> 00:37:20.130
把别人称为朋友
of callin' somebody his friend...


801
00:37:20.130 --> 00:37:22.330
然后别人说“嘿 哥们 我不是你朋友”
...and they sayin', "Hey, bro, I'm not your friend."


802
00:37:22.340 --> 00:37:23.830
他可能就会自杀了
Then he'd have to kill himself.


803
00:37:23.840 --> 00:37:25.800
但是你们是同事又是什么意思?
But how are you coworkers?


804
00:37:25.800 --> 00:37:28.140
我们一起拍小电影
We, um, we make films.


805
00:37:28.400 --> 00:37:30.240
电影?
Movies?


806
00:37:30.240 --> 00:37:33.010
是 我们合作了好几年了
Yeah. We been making them for a few years now.


807
00:37:33.010 --> 00:37:34.880
到现在一共拍了42部了
We have, like, 42 in total.


808
00:37:35.340 --> 00:37:37.280
Greg! 你都没跟我说过！
Greg! You never told me.


809
00:37:37.280 --> 00:37:38.810
呃 我们谁也没告诉过
Well, we never told anybody 'bout them.


810
00:37:38.810 --> 00:37:40.810
他们很烂的 我是说 真的都很不好看的
They suck. I mean, they're terrible.


811
00:37:40.820 --> 00:37:43.020
我敢肯定它们没那么烂
I'm pretty sure they don't suck.


812
00:37:43.020 --> 00:37:44.520
你要是想看的话可以自己来看啊
Well, you can see for yourself if you want.


813
00:37:45.280 --> 00:37:46.820
真的吗?
Are you sure?


814
00:37:46.820 --> 00:37:47.820
那当然 别担心
Hell, yeah, don't even worry about it.


815
00:37:47.820 --> 00:37:48.990
不过别告诉别人
Just don't tell nobody.


816
00:37:48.990 --> 00:37:50.050
当然 我不会的
No, of course, I won't.


817
00:37:51.820 --> 00:37:53.120
好了 小子 起来吧
All right, son, get on your feet.


818
00:37:53.120 --> 00:37:54.020
听起来不错
Sounds good.


819
00:37:54.990 --> 00:37:56.260
我们要去哪儿?
Where are we going?


820
00:37:57.490 --> 00:38:02.260
《蓝丝绒之酿猴酒》（不是大卫林奇拍的哦）

821
00:38:12.690 --> 00:38:16.260
Earl是怎么把最后的秘密泄露出去的

822
00:38:23.980 --> 00:38:25.350
我们可以送你回家啊
We can walk you home.


823
00:38:25.350 --> 00:38:26.780
他得缓一缓
He needs to recover,


824
00:38:26.780 --> 00:38:28.250
你得照顾他吧
and you probably should look after him.


825
00:38:30.050 --> 00:38:31.250
保重保重
Peace, peace.


826
00:38:31.250 --> 00:38:32.780
- 谢谢 拜拜
Thanks. Bye.


827
00:38:35.950 --> 00:38:38.050
该死 Earl
Goddamn it, Earl.


828
00:38:38.060 --> 00:38:39.860
小子 你啥也别说了
Son, don't even start.


829
00:38:39.860 --> 00:38:41.060
猪蹄 吃吗
Pig's foot.


830
00:38:46.030 --> 00:38:48.830
那啥 这个傻故事 都讲了这么长时间了...
So, we're pretty far into this stupid story now...


831
00:38:48.830 --> 00:38:51.130
你可能在想
...and you're probably saying to yourself,


832
00:38:51.130 --> 00:38:53.100
"我挺喜欢Rachel这姑娘的
"Hey. I like this girl Rachel.


833
00:38:53.100 --> 00:38:55.870
"如果她最后死了的话 我会气死的"
"And I'm gonna be pissed if she dies at the end."


834
00:38:55.870 --> 00:38:58.900
我就剧透算了 别害怕 她活下来了
don't freak out. She survives.


835
00:39:00.140 --> 00:39:02.140
希望这能给你吃个定心丸
So, hopefully, that reassures you.


836
00:39:04.080 --> 00:39:06.340
不过 话说回来 为啥呢
Although, actually, why would it?


837
00:39:06.350 --> 00:39:09.480
我对你们今天的热情感到震撼
I'm just overwhelmed with your enthusiasm today.


838
00:39:09.480 --> 00:39:10.950
所以我们还是
I guess we're just gonna have to do it


839
00:39:10.950 --> 00:39:12.450
来个经典玩法吧
the old-fashioned way.


840
00:39:13.280 --> 00:39:15.080
我会想你们一个人的名字
I'm thinking of one of you.


841
00:39:15.090 --> 00:39:16.480
我不会说是谁
I'm not gonna mention any names,


842
00:39:16.490 --> 00:39:18.320
但是这个人的名字缩写是...
but your initials...
...Scott Mayhew
...are Scott Mayhew.


843
00:39:20.060 --> 00:39:22.090
事实：Greg一直跟大家说
Greg's been telling everyone


844
00:39:22.090 --> 00:39:23.560
你的汤里有大麻
your soup has marijuana in it.


845
00:39:23.560 --> 00:39:25.430
我谁也没告诉
I didn't tell anyone.


846
00:39:25.430 --> 00:39:27.030
我听见你在校车上叨逼叨来着
I heard you bellowing about it on public transit.


847
00:39:27.030 --> 00:39:28.530
这是事实吗 Greg?
Is that a fact, Greg?


848
00:39:31.260 --> 00:39:34.370
是这样 昨天 我和Earl不知怎么嗑嗨了
Look, yesterday, Earl and I got stoned somehow.


849
00:39:34.370 --> 00:39:36.230
就在我俩喝了你的汤之后
And it was after we both ate your soup.


850
00:39:36.240 --> 00:39:37.470
我们两个没有抽大麻
And we didn't smoke any marijuana,


851
00:39:37.470 --> 00:39:39.300
我这辈子也没抽过那个 所以...
which I have never done, so...


852
00:39:39.310 --> 00:39:40.600
你的汤里肯定有大麻
Your soup must have drugs in it,


853
00:39:40.610 --> 00:39:42.270
因为我们就一起吃了那个...
'cause that was the only thing we both ate...


854
00:39:42.270 --> 00:39:43.870
...哦 还有从Ill Phil那儿赢的饼干
...other than some cookies we got from Ill Phil,


855
00:39:43.880 --> 00:39:45.170
那个药贩子
the drug dealer.


856
00:39:46.840 --> 00:39:49.140
啊哈
Aha.


857
00:39:49.150 --> 00:39:51.480
天啊 为什么我们就没想到饼干呢
Man, how did you not know it was the cookies?


858
00:39:51.480 --> 00:39:54.420
是因为你个傻逼在校车上大喊大叫
Man, it was your dumb ass yelling that shit on the bus.


859
00:39:54.420 --> 00:39:55.980
嘿 Greg!
Yo, Greg!


860
00:39:55.990 --> 00:39:57.580
你告我的密了?
Did you snitch on me?


861
00:39:57.590 --> 00:39:59.020
他确实告了你的密!
He did snitch on you!


862
00:39:59.890 --> 00:40:01.190
我当时在场
I was there.


863
00:40:01.190 --> 00:40:03.150
我听到你 跟你的小女生朋友们
I heard you ridiculing me


864
00:40:03.160 --> 00:40:04.460
开我的玩笑
in front of your loathsome harem.


865
00:40:05.360 --> 00:40:08.460
你可给自己树了个天敌
You have made... a mortal enemy.


866
00:40:08.460 --> 00:40:10.360
我永远不会放过你的
And I will never stop hounding you.


867
00:40:10.360 --> 00:40:12.890
是的 你树了两个天敌 我给你讲 我可捅过人
Yeah, you made two mortal enemies. I stabbed a dude.


868
00:40:12.900 --> 00:40:14.360
上帝啊
Jesus.


869
00:40:15.360 --> 00:40:20.890
我会用20种不同方式杀掉你 用刀捅你 射杀你 掐死你...

870
00:40:30.360 --> 00:40:33.890
Rachel去化疗的几周

871
00:40:38.360 --> 00:40:40.890
我说什么呢？

872
00:40:47.020 --> 00:40:48.990
其实他们啥也没干
So they haven't really done anything.


873
00:40:48.990 --> 00:40:51.190
算起来快一个月了
It's been about a month now.


874
00:40:51.200 --> 00:40:53.930
他们确实说了永远不会放过我
They did say they're never gonna stop hounding me...


875
00:40:53.930 --> 00:40:56.460
所以 大概早晚吧
...so, sooner or later... you know...


876
00:40:56.470 --> 00:40:57.600
我都会被他们整的
...gonna get hounded.


877
00:41:00.940 --> 00:41:03.500
对不起 下次我会带点花来
Sorry, next time I'll bring you some flowers.


878
00:41:05.370 --> 00:41:07.440
不过我也不知道要放在哪里
Though I don't even know where I'd put them.


879
00:41:07.440 --> 00:41:09.670
好像只有呕吐筐还是空的了
It's like, like the only place left is the barf bucket.


880
00:41:12.640 --> 00:41:14.210
鲜花
Flowers.


881
00:41:16.050 --> 00:41:17.250
就放在你呕吐的地方
Where you barf.


882
00:41:23.290 --> 00:41:24.520
我喜欢你的帽子
I like that hat.


883
00:41:26.420 --> 00:41:27.650
蛮可爱的
It's pretty cute.


884
00:41:32.660 --> 00:41:37.230
你看 我一直也不是漂亮型的
Look, I've never been very beautiful...


885
00:41:37.230 --> 00:41:40.130
我也觉得没关系 因为我不看重这些
...and that's fine because that's not important to me.


886
00:41:40.430 --> 00:41:41.600
但是...
But...


887
00:41:44.670 --> 00:41:46.370
我本以为自己可以轻松接自己这幅样子
I thought it'd be easier looking like this.


888
00:41:46.370 --> 00:41:47.500
但事实上我接受不了
It's just not.


889
00:41:50.470 --> 00:41:53.510
大家来看我
Everyone comes in here and sees me...


890
00:41:53.510 --> 00:41:55.480
...但却都很明显地抗拒
...and they're so clearly repulsed.


891
00:41:57.280 --> 00:41:59.180
真的比我想象的难多了
It's so much harder than I thought it would be.


892
00:41:59.650 --> 00:42:01.080
嘿 别这么说
Hey, come on.


893
00:42:01.480 --> 00:42:03.010
你很美
You look good.


894
00:42:03.010 --> 00:42:07.280
我很丑的 Greg! 我很丑
I'm ugly, Greg! I'm so ugly.


895
00:42:07.280 --> 00:42:09.250
大家都觉得该对我撒谎
Everyone feels like they have to lie to me and no one


896
00:42:09.250 --> 00:42:11.950
但没人觉得这样有多伤人
realizes how insulting that is.


897
00:42:11.950 --> 00:42:13.550
大家都觉得他们在帮我 但其实没有
Everyone thinks they're helping, and they're not.


898
00:42:29.600 --> 00:42:30.700
给
Here.


899
00:42:32.100 --> 00:42:33.400
这个叫 魔生门
That one's called Mono Rash.


900
00:42:33.410 --> 00:42:35.640
是根据黑泽明的 罗生门 改编的
It's based on Rashomon by Kurosawa.


901
00:42:35.640 --> 00:42:37.070
情节就是Earl一直在杀人
Plot's basically just Earl killing people


902
00:42:37.080 --> 00:42:38.470
因为他生病了 发了疯
'cause he has a rash...


903
00:42:38.480 --> 00:42:40.540
...你知道 就是单核细胞增多症
...from mono, you know, the STD.


904
00:42:42.710 --> 00:42:45.580
不管怎么样吧 我们要开始拍
Anyway, we're supposed to go work on


905
00:42:45.580 --> 00:42:48.010
《现代启示录》的致敬了
our homage to Apocalypse Now.


906
00:42:48.020 --> 00:42:50.080
我们的小电影叫 《现代启示录之哇哦一盒郁金香》
Ours is called A Box O' Lips, Wow,


907
00:42:50.080 --> 00:42:50.810
我觉得比《魔生门》还逊
which is even worse than Mono Rash.


908
00:42:52.380 --> 00:42:54.480
是一部战争片 讲的是两个人
It's a war movie where these two guys


909
00:42:54.490 --> 00:42:56.150
加入了一场难以言说的残忍战争
take part in the unspeakable brutality of war...


910
00:42:56.150 --> 00:42:58.420
...然后找到了一盒郁金香
...and then they find a box of tulips.


911
00:42:58.420 --> 00:43:00.660
《一盒郁金香》嘛 然后他俩就说“哇哦”
Box O' Lips, yeah. And they're just, "Wow."


912
00:43:00.660 --> 00:43:02.720
这盒郁金香实在太美好了 他俩受不了了
They can't get over how great these tulips are,


913
00:43:02.730 --> 00:43:04.060
他俩就说 "哇哦！一盒郁金香诶!"
it's like, "A box o' lips, wow!"


914
00:43:05.490 --> 00:43:06.730
不过最逊的是 郁金香太贵了
The worst part is, tulips might not


915
00:43:06.730 --> 00:43:08.230
我们的成本根本买不起
even be in the budget anymore.


916
00:43:10.700 --> 00:43:12.100
我还是在这儿呆着吧
I should actually just stay here


917
00:43:12.100 --> 00:43:13.130
不该让你看见这种垃圾
and keep you from watching that.


918
00:43:13.660 --> 00:43:16.230
没关系 去拍吧！
No! I'm fine. Go make it.


919
00:43:16.230 --> 00:43:17.200
好
Okay.


920
00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:21.700
好吧 祝你看这部烂片
Okay. Have fun watching


921
00:43:21.700 --> 00:43:23.640
看得愉快
this incredibly terrible movie.


922
00:43:23.640 --> 00:43:25.740
嗯 你也
Mmm. Have fun


923
00:43:25.740 --> 00:43:27.010
- 拍片愉快 - 嗯哼
making the next one. Mmm-hmm.


924
00:43:50.300 --> 00:43:52.330
嘿 白人男孩!
Hey, white boy!


925
00:43:52.330 --> 00:43:53.860
你给我做一朵郁金香吧 不然我会把Doopie叫来
Why don't you make me a tulip 'fore I have Doopie come down


926
00:43:53.870 --> 00:43:55.470
让他生吃了你
there and eat your face?


927
00:43:56.670 --> 00:43:58.700
不是 说真的 你能给我做朵郁金香吗？
But no, for real. Can you make me a tulip?


928
00:43:58.700 --> 00:44:00.440
我的天啊 我在片场吗？
Oh, my God! Am I on set right now?


929
00:44:00.440 --> 00:44:01.800
- 该死! 我的天
Oh, damn! Oh, my God!


930
00:44:01.810 --> 00:44:04.510
啊啊啊 好激动 开机！停机！
Ahh! I can't take it! Action! Cut!


931
00:44:05.670 --> 00:44:08.240
Madison 你来这干嘛?
Madison, why are you here?


932
00:44:08.240 --> 00:44:09.710
Rachel说我能在这找到你
Rachel said that I could find you here...


933
00:44:09.710 --> 00:44:11.580
...你电话直接转语音信箱了
...and your phone was going straight to voice mail.


934
00:44:11.580 --> 00:44:13.750
大概是因为这里一点信号都没!
Probably 'cause there ain't no good service down there!


935
00:44:13.750 --> 00:44:15.750
但是我得来 我得跟你说件事
But I had to get here 'cause I had to let you know.


936
00:44:15.750 --> 00:44:18.420
是这样 我去看Rachel 给她送慰问卡
So, I was visiting Rachel, and I was giving her a card...


937
00:44:18.420 --> 00:44:20.750
她正在看你的一部小电影
...and she was watching one of your secret movies.


938
00:44:20.750 --> 00:44:22.350
天啊 你也看到了？
Oh, my God. Wait, did you see any of it?


939
00:44:22.360 --> 00:44:23.720
没有 她立马就关掉了
No! No, she turned it off immediately.


940
00:44:23.720 --> 00:44:25.360
我觉得挺好看的
It was good, it was good.


941
00:44:25.360 --> 00:44:26.590
就是 你俩都是日本人...
You know, you're both Japanese, and...


942
00:44:26.590 --> 00:44:28.260
然后Earl砍你的头
...Earl beheaded you, and, but then,


943
00:44:28.260 --> 00:44:29.930
然后她就关掉了
she, like, turned it off.


944
00:44:29.930 --> 00:44:32.460
但是我有个想法 一个很赞的想法
But I had a brainstorm. Okay? I had an amazing brainstorm.


945
00:44:32.460 --> 00:44:35.560
我想 你应该给Rachel拍部电影
I realized... you need to make a film for Rachel.


946
00:44:36.930 --> 00:44:39.570
你怎么想?
What do you think?


947
00:44:39.570 --> 00:44:41.500
那会是她在这世上最喜欢的东西
It would be like her favorite thing in the entire world...


948
00:44:41.500 --> 00:44:42.700
也会是你人生中做过的最重要的一件事
...and it's like the most important thing you could do.


949
00:44:43.700 --> 00:44:45.240
你一定得答应
You have to do it.


950
00:44:49.280 --> 00:44:50.810
好吧 保证
Yeah, word.


951
00:44:50.810 --> 00:44:52.910
"保证"? 意思是 你同意了？
"Word"? Like, word, you'll do it, word?


952
00:45:00.680 --> 00:45:02.220
是的
Yep.


953
00:45:02.220 --> 00:45:03.450
天啊 太好了!
Oh, my God, awesome!


954
00:45:03.450 --> 00:45:04.720
那啥 等不及看你的成片了！
Okay, well, I can't wait to see it.


955
00:45:04.720 --> 00:45:05.820
呃 好吧 我要走了 那...
Um, okay, I gotta go, but...


956
00:45:06.790 --> 00:45:07.820
停!
Cut!


957
00:45:08.750 --> 00:45:09.820
杀青!
That's a wrap!


958
00:45:10.420 --> 00:45:11.390
别停!
Rolling!


959
00:45:12.420 --> 00:45:13.720
女人啊
Titties.


960
00:45:13.720 --> 00:45:15.190
该死!
Goddamn it!


961
00:45:15.860 --> 00:45:17.460
在接下来的几周里
In the next few weeks,


962
00:45:17.460 --> 00:45:19.660
我开始拍这电影了么？ 没有
did I start making that movie? No.


963
00:45:19.660 --> 00:45:21.590
因为我并不同意拍这部片
Because I didn't agree to make that movie.


964
00:45:21.600 --> 00:45:23.730
我只是说了“保证”而已
All I said was, "Word."


965
00:45:23.730 --> 00:45:25.730
也可以什么意义都没有啊
"Word" could mean anything.


966
00:45:25.730 --> 00:45:27.200
还有 在Rachel看完我们的烂片之前
Plus, we had at least a month or two...


967
00:45:27.200 --> 00:45:30.640
大概只剩一个多月了
all the terrible films we'd already made.


968
00:45:30.640 --> 00:45:33.500
比如 《袜条橙》
For example, A Sockwork Orange.


969
00:45:58.730 --> 00:45:59.830
"Droogle"?
"Droogle"?


970
00:46:01.360 --> 00:46:03.000
是流氓们用的谷歌
It's Google for droogs.


971
00:46:04.230 --> 00:46:06.370
那是什么?
What's that?


972
00:46:06.370 --> 00:46:07.730
没什么 只是我的死对头
Nothing, just the bane of my existence.


973
00:46:09.840 --> 00:46:11.540
我妈妈逼着我一直带着这本书
Which my mom is forcing me to carry around


974
00:46:11.540 --> 00:46:12.840
直到我找到好大学申请
until I apply to some colleges.


975
00:46:14.570 --> 00:46:16.340
她说 这玩意就像是
She says it's like a menu


976
00:46:16.340 --> 00:46:17.410
写满我未来的菜单 我想 "那是
for my future, and I was, like, "Sure.


977
00:46:17.410 --> 00:46:19.540
"一个只有在接下来四年里
"A menu that only has food


978
00:46:19.540 --> 00:46:21.780
"无休止地羞辱我的食品的菜单"
"that will humiliate me for four years."


979
00:46:21.780 --> 00:46:25.550
你在大学的问题上能不能别这么傻
You have to be less of an idiot about college.


980
00:46:25.550 --> 00:46:27.780
听着 如果你觉得人们不喜欢你
Listen, even if you think people won't like you...


981
00:46:27.780 --> 00:46:30.890
这想法本来就很荒唐
...which is literally an insane thing to think...


982
00:46:30.890 --> 00:46:32.690
...你在大学里不用在人群中暴露很多的
...you're way less exposed to people in college.


983
00:46:32.690 --> 00:46:35.460
高中一周课大概40小时
High school is 40 hours of class a week.


984
00:46:35.460 --> 00:46:38.420
大学只有15到20小时
College is, like, 15 and 20.


985
00:46:38.430 --> 00:46:39.560
如果你不想住校的话
And if you don't want to live with other people,


986
00:46:39.560 --> 00:46:41.860
那去匹茨堡州立大学啊
then go to Pittsburgh State.


987
00:46:41.860 --> 00:46:43.930
这样就可以走读了
Live at home.


988
00:46:43.930 --> 00:46:46.800
总比因为你不理智地讨厌自己
It's better than sitting college out


989
00:46:46.800 --> 00:46:47.930
而不上大学好吧
because you irrationally hate yourself.


990
00:46:48.670 --> 00:46:50.730
我没有不理智
Not irrationally, though.


991
00:46:50.740 --> 00:46:52.000
申请匹茨堡州立大学吧
Apply to Pittsburgh State.


992
00:46:53.270 --> 00:46:56.440
现在就申请 早点申请
Right now. Apply early.


993
00:46:56.440 --> 00:46:59.410
来 现在就当着我的面申请 申请匹茨堡州立大学
Come on. Do it in front of me. Apply to Pittsburgh State.


994
00:46:59.410 --> 00:47:00.470
如果我说不呢?
What if I say no?


995
00:47:02.440 --> 00:47:04.380
我癌症四期了
I have stage four cancer.


996
00:47:06.710 --> 00:47:08.780
所以你要是拒绝 就是个混蛋
So that would be a pretty dick move. Come on.


997
00:47:08.780 --> 00:47:09.750
好吧
Fine.


998
00:47:16.890 --> 00:47:20.690
"为什么我想上大学"
"Why I want to go... to college."


999
00:47:25.030 --> 00:47:26.890
作者 沃纳·赫尔佐格
By Werner Herzog.


1000
00:47:28.760 --> 00:47:29.860
高度选择性的
The highly selective


1001
00:47:29.860 --> 00:47:31.760
招生过程...
admissions process...


1002
00:47:31.760 --> 00:47:34.770
...剔除那些残忍和愚蠢的学生
...weeds out the cruel and the stupid.


1003
00:47:34.770 --> 00:47:38.340
因此大学并不像高中那样
So college is unlike the senseless chaos...


1004
00:47:38.340 --> 00:47:41.910
是完全的病态 无序的混乱
...and sickening enormity of high school.


1005
00:47:41.910 --> 00:47:45.340
高中像是恶魔的嘴巴
High school is the mouth of a great demon...


1006
00:47:45.340 --> 00:47:47.080
撕咬 咀嚼
...biting and chewing


1007
00:47:47.080 --> 00:47:48.510
将人折磨得体无完肤
and smushing people in the face.


1008
00:47:49.880 --> 00:47:52.510
真是无法忍受
It is simply overwhelming.


1009
00:47:56.350 --> 00:47:58.020
好了 十分庄重地说
In all seriousness,


1010
00:47:58.020 --> 00:47:59.990
我很期待大学生活
I am looking forward to college...


1011
00:47:59.990 --> 00:48:02.760
因为高中并不适合我
...because I didn't really fit in in high school,


1012
00:48:02.760 --> 00:48:03.590
因为我丑得像耗子
because of my weird rodent face...


1013
00:48:03.590 --> 00:48:05.090
才没有
No.


1014
00:48:05.090 --> 00:48:07.860
...并且有种说世界上最傻的话的习惯
...and a habit of saying the dumbest possible shit.


1015
00:48:07.860 --> 00:48:09.490
才没有!
No!


1016
00:48:09.500 --> 00:48:12.560
我的发青的面色
The sheer pastiness of my complexion...


1017
00:48:12.560 --> 00:48:16.700
让人看了就想吐
...overwhelms all who behold it with existential nausea.


1018
00:48:16.700 --> 00:48:20.970
"在高中 我从未在自己身上
"In high school, I never truly felt comfortable...


1019
00:48:21.640 --> 00:48:23.370
"感觉舒适
"...in my own skin.


1020
00:48:23.370 --> 00:48:25.470
"实际上 我是那种...
"In fact, I've always been someone...


1021
00:48:25.480 --> 00:48:30.010
"不怎么喜欢自己的人
"...who doesn't really like themselves.


1022
00:48:30.010 --> 00:48:34.110
"但我认为 我还要成长的
"But I think that's because I have some growing up to do...


1023
00:48:34.120 --> 00:48:37.980
"...所以大学是个合适的地方"
"...and college is the place where I'm going to do it."


1024
00:48:41.520 --> 00:48:42.820
这也太私人了吧
That's way too personal.


1025
00:48:42.920 --> 00:48:44.820
本来就是个人的论文啊

1026
00:48:47.060 --> 00:48:48.460
好吧 那你还想看这个吗...
Fine, if you want to see this again...


1027
00:48:48.460 --> 00:48:49.990
好吧！好吧！
Okay! Okay!


1028
00:48:50.990 --> 00:48:53.130
只是因为你的癌症
But only because cancer.


1029
00:48:54.600 --> 00:48:56.930
还有 猜怎么着 你也得跟我一样
And you know what? You have to do this too now. Here.


1030
00:48:57.970 --> 00:48:59.630
翻翻这本可怕的大部头
Page through this huge, horrible book


1031
00:48:59.640 --> 00:49:00.900
找到你想申请的大学
and find some colleges.


1032
00:49:00.900 --> 00:49:01.870
轮到你了
That's yours now.


1033
00:49:03.540 --> 00:49:05.440
嗯哼 就像是写满你未来的菜单
Mmm. It's like a menu for your future.


1034
00:49:09.870 --> 00:49:11.740
我能先看完电影吗?
Can I finish my movie first?


1035
00:49:50.630 --> 00:49:52.970
失败的友谊：第64天

1036
00:50:02.430 --> 00:50:04.970
失败的友谊：第71天

1037
00:50:25.830 --> 00:50:27.970
失败的友谊：第85天

1038
00:51:33.130 --> 00:51:34.970
这样 如果我们拍了这部电影
So, if we make this film,


1039
00:51:34.970 --> 00:51:35.830
人们会说:
people are gonna be, like:


1040
00:51:36.500 --> 00:51:37.730
"哦 Greg今儿Earl
"Oh, Greg and Earl,


1041
00:51:37.740 --> 00:51:39.530
"他们就是那俩怪兮兮的电影人
"they're those weird filmmakers.


1042
00:51:39.540 --> 00:51:41.270
"总是神神秘秘地拍东西
"They're always creepily filming stuff.


1043
00:51:41.270 --> 00:51:42.870
"可能某天晚上他们会溜进你家
"They'll probably sneak into your house one night


1044
00:51:42.870 --> 00:51:44.240
"拍你睡觉的样子"
"and film you while you're sleeping."


1045
00:51:44.240 --> 00:51:45.740
但大家可能已经开始这么想了
But people probably already think that,


1046
00:51:45.740 --> 00:51:49.240
所以现在我变得这么多疑 - 真难吃
So now, I've become completely conspicuous,


1047
00:51:49.240 --> 00:51:50.810
一直紧张
like all the time.


1048
00:51:50.810 --> 00:51:52.140
人们会看着我 然后想
People look at me and think,


1049
00:51:52.150 --> 00:51:53.510
"拍电影的" - 这什么玩意啊
"Filmmaker." The hell even is this?


1050
00:51:53.510 --> 00:51:54.510
人们已经认为我是
When they're not already thinking,


1051
00:51:54.520 --> 00:51:55.750
"那个癌症女的男朋友"
"Cancer girl's boyfriend."


1052
00:51:55.750 --> 00:51:57.010
吃着就像狗的屁眼
It tastes like a dog's funky-ass butthole.


1053
00:51:57.020 --> 00:51:58.620
此外 我们还同意拍一部
Furthermore, we agreed to do a film


1054
00:51:58.620 --> 00:52:00.050
我们也不知道会是什么样的
that we have no idea what it should look like...


1055
00:52:00.050 --> 00:52:02.050
电影
...or sound like, or even be.


1056
00:52:02.050 --> 00:52:03.150
我是说 我连拍什么类型
I mean, what the hell sort of film


1057
00:52:03.160 --> 00:52:05.320
都还不知道 该拍啥呢？
should we even make? Huh?


1058
00:52:05.320 --> 00:52:07.320
我都不知道自己真么想的?
I mean, what was I thinking?


1059
00:52:07.330 --> 00:52:08.320
你在想那个美女Madison
You were thinking that girl Madison


1060
00:52:08.330 --> 00:52:09.830
有对漂亮的奶头
had nice titties.


1061
00:52:09.830 --> 00:52:11.030
我是说 我也喜欢奶头
I mean, I like the titties too,


1062
00:52:11.030 --> 00:52:12.890
但这是你的问题
but now you got a problem.


1063
00:52:12.900 --> 00:52:14.160
因为可不是我同意拍这个的
'Cause I ain't agreed to do this shit.


1064
00:52:14.160 --> 00:52:15.130
是你同意的
You did.


1065
00:52:17.060 --> 00:52:19.130
你不帮我拍吗？
Are you not gonna help me make this?


1066
00:52:19.130 --> 00:52:21.170
我们拍啥呢 小子
The hell we gonna make, son?


1067
00:52:21.170 --> 00:52:23.770
他们想要新鲜的灵感
They want fresh inspiration.


1068
00:52:23.770 --> 00:52:25.140
我必须告诉你 我得到过的
I must tell you, the richest inspiration


1069
00:52:25.140 --> 00:52:27.240
最丰富的灵感是
I have ever known was...


1070
00:52:27.240 --> 00:52:29.740
...我在亚马逊被隔离的那段时间
...during my period of quarantine in the Amazon.


1071
00:52:30.980 --> 00:52:32.780
我当时跟其他六七个人被困
Where I and a half dozen other...


1072
00:52:32.780 --> 00:52:35.110
满目都是各种
...unfortunates had nothing to watch...


1073
00:52:35.110 --> 00:52:39.010
大狼蛛
...but the bristling, leviathan tarantula...


1074
00:52:39.020 --> 00:52:42.180
爬上腐烂的茅草棚
...bunched up on the rotting, flimsy thatch...


1075
00:52:42.180 --> 00:52:43.850
离我们的脸只有大概8英尺
...perhaps eight feet above our faces.


1076
00:52:44.750 --> 00:52:47.820
那蜘蛛有拳头那么大
Spiders the size of your fist.


1077
00:52:47.820 --> 00:52:50.290
他们的尖牙闪烁着毒液
Their fangs glistening with venom and...


1078
00:52:50.290 --> 00:52:52.090
几千个黑色的复眼
...their thousand-fold black eyes


1079
00:52:52.090 --> 00:52:54.390
在昏暗中闪着呆滞的光芒
shining dully in the gloom.


1080
00:52:54.390 --> 00:52:55.860
在黑暗中 你甚至能听见
In the darkness, you would hear


1081
00:52:55.860 --> 00:52:57.860
突然的痛苦嘶叫
the sudden anguished hiss...


1082
00:52:57.860 --> 00:53:00.800
那是蜘蛛被豹蜂困住的声音
...of a spider being struck by an adult leopard wasp...


1083
00:53:00.800 --> 00:53:02.100
在他们的挣扎过程中
...and in their mortal struggle,


1084
00:53:02.100 --> 00:53:03.400
他们会骤降到某人的床上
they would plummet to one's bed...


1085
00:53:03.400 --> 00:53:06.030
咬啊 叮啊...
...biting and stinging and thrashing...


1086
00:53:08.000 --> 00:53:09.800
你知道马蜂也可以熏烤着吃吗?
You know that you can smoke a hornet?


1087
00:53:11.740 --> 00:53:14.040
那这样 你回答问题的时候看我就好
Okay, so just look at me when you answer the questions.


1088
00:53:14.040 --> 00:53:15.810
不要担心镜头 好吧?
Don't worry about the camera, all right?


1089
00:53:16.980 --> 00:53:19.110
好 Denise
Okay, Denise.


1090
00:53:19.110 --> 00:53:20.410
给我讲讲Rachel的出生吧
Tell me a little about Rachel's birth.


1091
00:53:21.710 --> 00:53:23.180
呃 Rachel的出生...
Uh, Rachel's birth.


1092
00:53:23.950 --> 00:53:25.380
那是多么难熬的经历啊
What an ordeal that was.


1093
00:53:28.050 --> 00:53:30.420
Greg 我就跟你说一件事
Greg, just... let me tell you one thing.


1094
00:53:31.990 --> 00:53:33.420
对她来说 我是个好妈妈 知道吗?
I was a really good mom to her, you know?


1095
00:53:33.420 --> 00:53:35.690
我真的是个好妈妈
I really was.


1096
00:53:35.690 --> 00:53:38.090
有些单身母亲 她们的孩子成长得太过迅速了
Some single moms, their kids grow up too fast...


1097
00:53:38.090 --> 00:53:39.860
但我极力保护Rachel
...but I always tried to protect Rachel from that.


1098
00:53:39.860 --> 00:53:41.930
我尽了最大的努力
I did my very best to protect her from...


1099
00:53:44.030 --> 00:53:45.430
...保护她 让她成长得慢些 明白吗?
...growing up too quickly, you know?


1100
00:53:47.270 --> 00:53:48.900
嗯
Right.


1101
00:53:48.900 --> 00:53:50.770
但现在 我懂得了有些事情
And now, I'm learning that there are...


1102
00:53:53.040 --> 00:53:55.740
你是根本保护不了她的
protect your kid from, you know?


1103
00:53:57.470 --> 00:53:59.370
无论你多努力 就是不能...
No matter what you do, you just...


1104
00:54:06.310 --> 00:54:09.810
那 她有最喜欢的玩具吗?
So, did she have any favorite toys?


1105
00:54:09.820 --> 00:54:11.320
在回答这个问题之前 我讲点认真的
Before I answer that question, this is serious...


1106
00:54:13.450 --> 00:54:15.850
所以你给我好好听着
...so use your ears and listen to me.


1107
00:54:17.190 --> 00:54:18.720
我想让你保证一件事
I want you to promise me something


1108
00:54:18.720 --> 00:54:20.320
因为我很在乎你
as I care about you.


1109
00:54:20.320 --> 00:54:21.990
你要保证 除非你
You gotta promise me you're not gonna have a baby...


1110
00:54:21.990 --> 00:54:23.190
非常非常爱你的另一半
...unless you're ready to love


1111
00:54:23.190 --> 00:54:24.390
否则不会要孩子
that baby's mother your whole life...


1112
00:54:24.390 --> 00:54:26.030
我是认真的
...and this is serious.


1113
00:54:26.030 --> 00:54:29.290
我给你讲的是独家秘笈
I'm telling you something that nobody's gonna tell you.


1114
00:54:29.300 --> 00:54:32.800
不要找善变的姑娘
Don't pick a girl who's push-pull, you know?


1115
00:54:32.800 --> 00:54:35.000
要找一个全身心爱你的
You wanna pick somebody who's gonna love you...


1116
00:54:36.030 --> 00:54:38.740
不会忘了你的
...and not forget you, and not...


1117
00:54:38.740 --> 00:54:41.170
不会扔下你独自一人的姑娘
...leave you for someone with a big, fat ass.


1118
00:54:42.040 --> 00:54:43.810
那 最喜欢的玩具是啥
So, no favorite toy.


1119
00:54:44.370 --> 00:54:45.270
呃...
Um...


1120
00:54:45.270 --> 00:54:48.440
哦 她还真有最喜欢的玩具
Oh, you want to know what? Here's a favorite toy.


1121
00:54:48.440 --> 00:54:49.980
剪刀
Scissors.


1122
00:54:49.980 --> 00:54:51.980
Rachel的爸爸刚离开我们的时候
When Rachel's father first left...


1123
00:54:51.980 --> 00:54:53.350
她收集了他所有的书
...she gathered up all his books,


1124
00:54:53.350 --> 00:54:57.380
把它们捆在一起 然后把它们都剪了
...and she rounded 'em up and she cut them right up.


1125
00:54:57.380 --> 00:54:58.420
请你别跟她说是我告诉你的
Please, don't tell her I'm telling you,


1126
00:54:58.420 --> 00:55:00.120
她会剪掉我的头的
she would chop my head off.


1127
00:55:00.120 --> 00:55:02.890
但她...
But she just...


1128
00:55:02.890 --> 00:55:04.920
我就想 "干得好 姑娘"
And I was, like, "Atta girl."


1129
00:55:04.920 --> 00:55:08.260
咔嚓 咔嚓 咔嚓 她当时好生气
Snip, snip, snip. She was very mad.


1130
00:55:08.260 --> 00:55:10.760
我们能不能休息一下 喝点酒什么的？
Can we take a little break and have a little taste?


1131
00:55:10.760 --> 00:55:12.260
你们的年龄足够喝酒了吧？
You boys are old enough to have a little taste, right?


1132
00:55:12.260 --> 00:55:14.230
我们就休息一小会儿 然后喝点酒吧?
Can we take a teeny break, just have a little taste?


1133
00:55:16.130 --> 00:55:18.870
好嘞 好孩子
Oh, yeah, that's a good boy.


1134
00:55:18.870 --> 00:55:21.470
Greg 你一起吗?
Greg, will you join us?


1135
00:55:21.470 --> 00:55:23.300
哦 算了
Oh, I'm okay.


1136
00:55:23.300 --> 00:55:26.800
来吧 不要扫兴! - 好吧
Oh, come on, don't be a party pooper!


1137
00:55:28.540 --> 00:55:30.810
现在我们接着采访吧
Now we can get back to our interview.


1138
00:55:32.040 --> 00:55:33.080
所以呢 这个拍法是这样
So, basically, this whole setup


1139
00:55:33.080 --> 00:55:34.480
就这样 你明白...
is so that, you know...


1140
00:55:34.480 --> 00:55:36.350
我能跟你说话 你也能跟我说
...I can talk to you, you can talk to me...


1141
00:55:36.350 --> 00:55:38.950
我能看见你 你也能看见我
...and I can see you, and you can see me.


1142
00:55:38.950 --> 00:55:40.180
不过其实对面不是我 是个手机
Except it's not really me, it's a phone.


1143
00:55:40.180 --> 00:55:41.880
我知道这听起来挺怪的
And I know that sounds kind of weird,


1144
00:55:41.880 --> 00:55:43.950
但是其实不怪的
but it's not.


1145
00:55:43.950 --> 00:55:46.490
所以呢 就像是个慰问卡一样的
So, anyway, just treat it like a get-well card,


1146
00:55:46.490 --> 00:55:48.020
你们可以看着镜头
you can look into the lens.


1147
00:55:48.020 --> 00:55:49.850
然后 呃...
And, uh...


1148
00:55:49.860 --> 00:55:51.790
就是个小视频嘛...
Yeah, it's a video, so you know...


1149
00:55:51.790 --> 00:55:52.860
不要太把它当回事
...don't think about it too hard,


1150
00:55:52.860 --> 00:55:54.790
就说点好的就可以了
but just make it good.


1151
00:55:54.790 --> 00:55:56.160
准备好了就开始吧
Start whenever you're ready.


1152
00:55:56.160 --> 00:55:57.860
嗨 Rachel
Hi, Rachel.


1153
00:55:57.860 --> 00:56:00.230
我跟你好像不太熟
I guess I don't really know you that well...


1154
00:56:00.230 --> 00:56:02.360
但是我看好你哟 你一定可以的
...but I believe in you. You can do it.


1155
00:56:02.370 --> 00:56:04.330
说得挺好的
That's real nice, yo.


1156
00:56:04.330 --> 00:56:06.170
你男朋友为你拍视频
It's so sweet that your boyfriend


1157
00:56:06.170 --> 00:56:07.900
真的太甜了
is doing this for you.


1158
00:56:07.900 --> 00:56:09.440
他一定很爱你
He must really love you.


1159
00:56:09.440 --> 00:56:11.270
姑娘 他不是她男朋友
Girl, that ain't her boyfriend.


1160
00:56:11.270 --> 00:56:13.070
哦
Oh.


1161
00:56:13.070 --> 00:56:15.110
我知道你是犹太人 所以只是想让你知道
I know you're Jewish, but I just wanted you to know


1162
00:56:15.110 --> 00:56:17.180
上帝为你安排好了计划
that God has a plan for you.


1163
00:56:17.180 --> 00:56:18.280
我觉得你挺酷的
You seem like a really cool person.


1164
00:56:18.280 --> 00:56:20.040
我们没怎么说过话
I know we don't really talk.


1165
00:56:20.050 --> 00:56:23.110
但是反正你朋友也挺多的
But you've got a lot of friends. And, uh...


1166
00:56:23.120 --> 00:56:24.010
学校里这么多人
Out of all the people in this school,


1167
00:56:24.020 --> 00:56:26.350
我不讨厌你
I don't hate you.


1168
00:56:26.350 --> 00:56:28.150
我看好你哟 你可以的
I believe in you and you can do it.


1169
00:56:28.980 --> 00:56:30.480
你可以的
You can do it.


1170
00:56:30.490 --> 00:56:32.020
我看好你哟
I believe in you.


1171
00:56:32.550 --> 00:56:34.090
你可以
You can do it.


1172
00:56:34.090 --> 00:56:35.290
妈的
Damn.


1173
00:56:39.090 --> 00:56:45.290
《午后牛仔之2点48》

1174
00:57:00.570 --> 00:57:02.410
所以 再说一次
So again,


1175
00:57:02.410 --> 00:57:04.240
如果这是个浪漫感人的琼瑶故事
if this was a touching, romantic story...


1176
00:57:04.250 --> 00:57:06.410
我们可能就会陷入热恋
...we'd obviously fall in love


1177
00:57:06.410 --> 00:57:08.150
她就会在弥留之际 说些智慧之言
and she'd say all the wise, beautiful things...


1178
00:57:08.150 --> 00:57:11.280
或者很美的告白 之类的
in life's twilight or whatever.


1179
00:57:11.280 --> 00:57:13.150
然后她会在我的臂弯中死去
And then she'd die in my arms.


1180
00:57:18.620 --> 00:57:21.220
但 再说一次 事实并不是这样的
But again, that's not what happened.


1181
00:57:21.230 --> 00:57:24.190
她只是越来越安静 越来越不开心
She just got quieter. And unhappier.


1182
00:57:25.360 --> 00:57:26.930
你好吗？
So, how are you?


1183
00:57:28.060 --> 00:57:29.260
说真的
For real.


1184
00:57:30.860 --> 00:57:32.060
说真的?
For real?


1185
00:57:33.970 --> 00:57:35.600
我觉得你可能是对的
Feeling like you might have been right.


1186
00:57:39.140 --> 00:57:40.340
什么对的?
Right when?


1187
00:57:41.570 --> 00:57:43.200
十月的时候
Back in October.


1188
00:57:44.310 --> 00:57:46.410
你不是觉得我会死嘛
When you thought I was dying.


1189
00:57:52.650 --> 00:57:55.010
呃 我很后悔那么想
Well, I mean, I regret thinking that.


1190
00:57:57.220 --> 00:57:58.480
不要后悔
Don't regret it.


1191
00:58:19.070 --> 00:58:21.000
这什么声音?
What is that noise?


1192
00:58:21.000 --> 00:58:22.600
是很后悔的北极熊的声音
It's Regretful Polar Bear.


1193
00:58:26.070 --> 00:58:27.610
北极熊拥有着动物王国中
Polar Bears have the purest expression


1194
00:58:27.610 --> 00:58:29.210
最纯粹的后悔的表达方式
of regret in the animal kingdom.


1195
00:58:31.110 --> 00:58:33.740
你听他们那余音绕梁的哀怨咆哮
Just listen to how haunting and plaintive they sound.


1196
00:58:37.210 --> 00:58:40.150
你能别让我笑么 挺疼的
Don't make me laugh. Please. It kinda hurts.


1197
00:58:41.680 --> 00:58:42.750
好吧
All right.


1198
00:58:53.490 --> 00:58:55.490
我觉得沉默在这儿挺瘆人的
Kind of a monster silence in here.


1199
00:58:58.130 --> 00:58:59.100
是
Yeah.


1200
00:59:01.600 --> 00:59:03.730
我们沉默一会儿也没什么的
It's okay to just be silent for a while.


1201
00:59:06.600 --> 00:59:08.500
你看
Look,


1202
00:59:08.500 --> 00:59:10.340
我知道你可能已经在说服自己 这个你们都非常喜欢的
I know you're really bracing for this sweet girl...


1203
00:59:10.340 --> 00:59:13.070
甜美女孩 马上就要死了
...that you probably like a lot to die.


1204
00:59:13.080 --> 00:59:16.380
但是 请忍一忍好吗？ 她并没有 她的情况好转了
Just please bear with me. She doesn't. She gets better.


1205
00:59:16.380 --> 00:59:18.240
我保证
I promise.


1206
00:59:57.420 --> 00:59:59.680
整个冬天 我唯一记得的
Pretty much all I remember from that winter...


1207
00:59:59.690 --> 01:00:01.520
就是拍这部傻里傻气的电影
...is working on that stupid film...


1208
01:00:01.520 --> 01:00:04.750
就是明知道自己什么都拍不好
that made some kind of sense...


1209
01:00:04.760 --> 01:00:06.420
却还是想拍点好东西出来
...and knowing the whole time that I couldn't...


1210
01:00:06.420 --> 01:00:09.730
想拍点我们想拍的东西
to make the thing we wanted to make...


1211
01:00:09.730 --> 01:00:11.430
不过对于我们来说 真的办不到
...but it wasn't possible for us.


1212
01:00:13.200 --> 01:00:15.400
失败的友谊：第149-159天 这就是我的整个寒假
That was an entire winter of my life.


1213
01:00:19.770 --> 01:00:21.270
我是说 当然
I mean, obviously,


1214
01:00:21.270 --> 01:00:22.430
我也记得去看Rachel
I remember visiting Rachel too.


1215
01:00:25.100 --> 01:00:26.370
她有时候会跟我聊天
Sometimes she talked,


1216
01:00:26.370 --> 01:00:28.270
有时她却不想说话
and sometimes, she didn't want to.


1217
01:00:29.570 --> 01:00:31.610
她不想说的时候 就换我说
When she didn't want to, I talked.


1218
01:00:31.610 --> 01:00:33.280
或者我们一起看电影
Or we watched movies.


1219
01:00:33.780 --> 01:00:34.740
有时候她会笑
Sometimes, she laughed.


1220
01:00:36.610 --> 01:00:37.840
有时候不会
Sometimes, she didn't.


1221
01:00:43.880 --> 01:00:46.450
我不记得的是 我跟本就放弃了学习
What I don't remember is doing schoolwork.


1222
01:00:49.290 --> 01:00:51.360
我当时完全不去上学了
I did literally zero schoolwork during this time.


1223
01:00:58.130 --> 01:00:58.730
我没有夸张
Not figuratively.


1224
01:01:00.160 --> 01:01:02.460
真的不上学了
Literally zero schoolwork.


1225
01:01:07.200 --> 01:01:08.870
那对我来说 其实挺难的
That's actually sort of hard to do.


1226
01:01:28.490 --> 01:01:30.360
那么 学校现在是什么样的呢?
So, what's going on at school?


1227
01:01:33.330 --> 01:01:35.460
此时此刻 学校就像一座城堡
Well, right now, the whole school looks like a castle...


1228
01:01:35.460 --> 01:01:37.460
因为每个人都在
...'cause everyone's getting ready


1229
01:01:37.460 --> 01:01:38.630
为中世纪舞会做准备
for Medieval Prom.


1230
01:01:41.470 --> 01:01:44.270
我猜学校里的每个人都在想着怎样
I guess everyone's trying to figure out how to, like...


1231
01:01:44.270 --> 01:01:45.500
穿着中世纪服装跳电臀舞
...twerk medievally?


1232
01:01:47.300 --> 01:01:48.640
你会去吗?
Are you going?


1233
01:01:48.640 --> 01:01:49.870
当然不去了
No, of course not.


1234
01:01:49.870 --> 01:01:51.570
你应该去
You should go.


1235
01:01:51.570 --> 01:01:52.910
才不!
No way!


1236
01:01:53.940 --> 01:01:55.740
你见过我穿西装吗?
Have you seen me in a tux?


1237
01:01:57.710 --> 01:01:59.940
就像强迫一只狗穿人的衣服一样
It's like when they make a dog wear human clothes.


1238
01:01:59.950 --> 01:02:01.610
你见过吗?
Have you seen that?


1239
01:02:01.610 --> 01:02:03.910
真的 看起来超可悲的
It just makes you really sad to look at.


1240
01:02:06.950 --> 01:02:09.550
哦 还有 根本没人和我一起去
Oh, and I don't have anyone to go with.


1241
01:02:09.550 --> 01:02:10.650
所以咯
So there's that.


1242
01:02:15.890 --> 01:02:17.890
除非...
Unless...


1243
01:02:17.890 --> 01:02:19.630
你...想跟我一起去
...you know... you wanted to...


1244
01:02:19.630 --> 01:02:21.590
Greg 我才不去舞会
Greg, I'm not going to prom.


1245
01:02:21.600 --> 01:02:23.630
我是觉得 你完全可以去啊
I mean, you totally could.


1246
01:02:23.630 --> 01:02:25.400
可以算是一个超棒的宣言
It could be like a, s-, awesome statement.


1247
01:02:25.730 --> 01:02:27.530
嘿
Hey, uh...


1248
01:02:27.530 --> 01:02:30.270
你们电影啥时候拍完?
When are you guys finishing your movie?


1249
01:02:33.670 --> 01:02:35.400
你才不知道我们现在在拍电影
You don't know we're working on a movie right now.


1250
01:02:36.210 --> 01:02:37.840
你别装了
You don't have to pretend.


1251
01:02:37.840 --> 01:02:40.440
Earl告诉我你们在为我拍一部电影
Earl told me you guys were making a movie for me.


1252
01:02:43.240 --> 01:02:44.410
天啊...是...
God, yeah...


1253
01:02:45.810 --> 01:02:47.410
好吧 他说的
I guess he probably did.


1254
01:02:48.510 --> 01:02:49.680
我问你 是因为...
I was just asking, because...


1255
01:02:49.680 --> 01:02:51.710
该死 Earl!
Goddamn it, Earl! Ugh.


1256
01:02:51.720 --> 01:02:53.850
只是 我想把这电影作为一个惊喜
It was just, it was supposed to be a surprise!


1257
01:02:54.820 --> 01:02:56.780
这电影真的花了很长时间
You know? It's taking forever


1258
01:02:56.790 --> 01:02:58.320
因为我们想拍得好一点
because we really want to get it right, and...


1259
01:02:58.320 --> 01:03:00.950
我可能马上就要停止治疗了
I'm probably gonna stop treatment pretty soon.


1260
01:03:05.860 --> 01:03:06.820
什么?
What?


1261
01:03:11.360 --> 01:03:13.330
因为完全没有
It just isn't doing me any good.


1262
01:03:13.330 --> 01:03:15.300
只会让我更难受
All it's doing is making me sicker.


1263
01:03:24.370 --> 01:03:26.740
是 但是...我是说 如果停止治疗的话...
Yeah, but it... I mean, if you stop, then...


1264
01:03:26.740 --> 01:03:28.640
我也不知道 等着看吧
Well, we'll just see what happens.


1265
01:03:30.610 --> 01:03:32.680
我们都知道会发生什么 是吧?
Well, we know what's gonna happen, right?


1266
01:03:45.490 --> 01:03:47.350
我想到一个人 你可以带着去舞会
I know who you can take to prom.


1267
01:03:50.320 --> 01:03:51.360
谁?
Who?


1268
01:03:53.860 --> 01:03:55.490
这个性感的枕头
This sexy pillow here.


1269
01:03:55.490 --> 01:03:56.590
我的天啊 你能不能--
Oh, my God, can you just...


1270
01:03:56.600 --> 01:03:58.490
哦哦哦 Greg
Ooh, Greg,


1271
01:03:58.500 --> 01:03:59.630
这个枕头叫Francesca
this pillow's name is Francesca.


1272
01:03:59.630 --> 01:04:00.800
别开玩笑 我没心情
Don't joke, I can't deal with that.


1273
01:04:00.800 --> 01:04:01.830
她是个来自意大利的蛇蝎女人
She's a filthy Italian woman.


1274
01:04:01.830 --> 01:04:02.700
求你了 停下!
Please, stop!


1275
01:04:04.570 --> 01:04:06.500
别吼我
Don't yell at me.


1276
01:04:06.500 --> 01:04:08.000
所以 就这样了? 什么大学
So, that's it? Just, to hell with college,


1277
01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:08.930
什么成长 都不要了?
to hell with growing up?


1278
01:04:08.940 --> 01:04:10.500
Greg 别这么说
Greg, don't.


1279
01:04:10.500 --> 01:04:11.770
Rachel 你这人怎么回事?
Rachel, what the hell is wrong with you?


1280
01:04:11.770 --> 01:04:13.340
这是你的生活!
This is your life!


1281
01:04:14.610 --> 01:04:16.470
是 这是我的生活
Yeah, it is my life.


1282
01:04:17.570 --> 01:04:19.780
是我必须每天躺在床上
It's me who has to lie in bed all day,


1283
01:04:19.780 --> 01:04:20.980
剃了难看的光头
with a shaved head...


1284
01:04:20.980 --> 01:04:22.980
越来越丑 越来越虚弱
...getting weaker and uglier,


1285
01:04:22.980 --> 01:04:26.650
越来越痛苦 看不到希望
and more miserable, with no hope in sight.


1286
01:04:26.650 --> 01:04:28.320
我才是承受这一切的人
I'm the one who has to suffer through this,


1287
01:04:28.320 --> 01:04:30.320
不是你 所以你别吼我
not you, so don't yell at me.


1288
01:04:32.950 --> 01:04:35.290
对不起 可是我做不到
I'm sorry, but I'm not gonna sit here


1289
01:04:35.290 --> 01:04:37.020
就坐在这里看你死
and get comfortable watching you die.


1290
01:04:39.330 --> 01:04:41.360
行吗？我做不到
Okay? I'm not. I'm not gonna do that.


1291
01:04:41.760 --> 01:04:43.500
所以不要让我这么做
So don't ask me to.


1292
01:04:44.760 --> 01:04:46.630
如果你不接受
If you can't accept that I'm going to do


1293
01:04:46.630 --> 01:04:48.670
我对我自己生活的选择
what I want to do with my life...


1294
01:04:49.970 --> 01:04:51.600
你就是个糟糕的朋友
...then you're a terrible friend.


1295
01:04:53.440 --> 01:04:54.970
我是个糟糕的朋友?
I'm a terrible friend?


1296
01:04:54.970 --> 01:04:55.940
好吧
Okay.


1297
01:04:55.940 --> 01:04:58.610
你知道吗 我才不是那个要放弃一切的
You know, I'm not the one giving up.


1298
01:04:58.610 --> 01:04:59.910
我不会放弃一切
I'm not ruining my friend's life


1299
01:04:59.910 --> 01:05:01.610
然后毁掉我朋友的生活
by giving up on the whole world.


1300
01:05:01.610 --> 01:05:03.580
得了 Greg 你才该兴高采烈吧
Oh, please, Greg, you should be overjoyed.


1301
01:05:03.580 --> 01:05:04.840
现在你终于可以回归自己的生活
Now you can go back to your life


1302
01:05:04.840 --> 01:05:07.080
在学校里当个
of being invisible and detached...


1303
01:05:07.080 --> 01:05:08.780
隐身的 讨厌自己的无名氏吧
...and self-hating.


1304
01:05:11.480 --> 01:05:12.510
是
Yeah.


1305
01:05:14.020 --> 01:05:15.880
然后你也可以回归你自己的生活 然后死翘翘
And you can go back to your life of being dead.


1306
01:05:18.050 --> 01:05:19.920
说得太好了
Nice. Really nice.


1307
01:05:26.090 --> 01:05:27.790
这会让你妈难受死的
This is gonna kill your mom.


1308
01:05:31.860 --> 01:05:33.660
你愿意看她这样吗?
Have you gotten comfortable with that?


1309
01:05:37.900 --> 01:05:40.040
还是你根本就不在乎?
That doesn't bother you anymore?


1310
01:05:40.040 --> 01:05:41.070
不在乎你妈妈?
Thinking about your mom?


1311
01:05:41.070 --> 01:05:42.440
滚出去 Greg
Get outta here, Greg.


1312
01:05:42.440 --> 01:05:44.110
你尽了你的责任了
You've done your time.


1313
01:05:44.110 --> 01:05:45.140
你不用再违心跟一个病姑娘一起玩了
You don't have to hang around with the sick girl anymore.


1314
01:05:49.880 --> 01:05:51.550
你怎么能对我这么说?
How can you even say that to me?


1315
01:05:52.980 --> 01:05:55.750
是你妈妈逼你来看我
Your mom forced you to hang out with me.


1316
01:05:55.750 --> 01:05:57.520
是Earl逼你给我看你们的电影
Earl forced you to show me your movies.


1317
01:05:57.520 --> 01:05:59.690
Madison 逼你拍一部给我的电影
Madison forced you to make a movie about me.


1318
01:05:59.690 --> 01:06:01.790
所以 跟我在一起的哪一部分是你真正愿意的?
So, what part of this did you actually want to do?


1319
01:06:21.940 --> 01:06:24.240
你能不能 就为我做一件事
Just... Just do something nice for me for once


1320
01:06:24.240 --> 01:06:25.940
就是滚出去
and just get out.


1321
01:06:51.730 --> 01:06:53.530
Earl!
Earl!


1322
01:06:53.540 --> 01:06:55.940
咱俩完了! 你太过分了!
This is it! You've gone too far!


1323
01:06:55.940 --> 01:06:57.140
你泄露了不能说的秘密
You've leaked the unleakable secret


1324
01:06:57.140 --> 01:06:58.800
因为你什么秘密也守不住
because you hold nothing sacred.


1325
01:06:58.810 --> 01:06:59.870
因为你是个混蛋!
'Cause you're a dickhead!


1326
01:06:59.870 --> 01:07:01.140
任何良好的合作关系
The foundation of any


1327
01:07:01.140 --> 01:07:02.970
的基础 都是信任
good working partnership is trust...


1328
01:07:02.980 --> 01:07:04.740
而我再也不能信任你了
...and I can no longer trust you in any way.


1329
01:07:04.740 --> 01:07:06.110
你什么秘密都跟别人说
You'll leak anything to anyone.


1330
01:07:06.110 --> 01:07:07.680
就像跟朱莉安·阿桑奇一起工作
It's like working with Julian Assange.


1331
01:07:07.680 --> 01:07:09.610
阿桑奇 混蛋阿桑奇！ 该死!
Assangde. Ass-andge. Damn it!


1332
01:07:12.680 --> 01:07:15.610
我们是怎么开始我们生命中的第一次争吵

1333
01:07:23.130 --> 01:07:25.230
你想干嘛?
The hell you want?


1334
01:07:25.230 --> 01:07:26.730
-我等Earl - 好好好
Just waiting for Earl. Awright, awright.


1335
01:07:27.930 --> 01:07:29.800
你好啊孩子 要进来吗?
Whassup, boy? You gonna come in?


1336
01:07:29.800 --> 01:07:32.030
是这样 Rachel告诉我说 你告诉她...
So, Rachel told me that you told her about the, uh...


1337
01:07:32.030 --> 01:07:33.170
...我们要拍一部给她的电影
...about the film that we're making for her.


1338
01:07:35.240 --> 01:07:37.200
你简直是告密的朱利安·阿桑奇
You're like Julian Assange, man.


1339
01:07:37.200 --> 01:07:38.840
你总是这样
It's like you always do this...


1340
01:07:38.840 --> 01:07:40.170
我真是不懂 因为你想
I don't know, 'cause you, like,


1341
01:07:40.170 --> 01:07:41.800
想当个比我更好的朋友吗？
wanna be a better friend than me or something?


1342
01:07:41.810 --> 01:07:42.940
我不知道在你混蛋地出卖我之后
I don't know if I can work with you again


1343
01:07:42.940 --> 01:07:44.040
我还能不能和你一起工作!
after you sell me out like a dick!


1344
01:07:44.040 --> 01:07:46.110
好吧 你小心
Oh, okay. Watch out, yo.


1345
01:07:47.540 --> 01:07:49.780
嘿 闭上你的臭嘴!
Hey, yo, shut your ass up, man!


1346
01:07:49.780 --> 01:07:51.080
你干嘛总是在乎别人想什么
Like you care so much about what other people think,


1347
01:07:51.080 --> 01:07:52.210
你一天吊儿郎当的
boy, you go around here...


1348
01:07:52.210 --> 01:07:53.680
讨好这个讨好那个
...kissin' everybody ass,


1349
01:07:53.680 --> 01:07:57.120
听着 根本没人在乎你 Greg!
Look, nobody gives a shit about you, Greg!


1350
01:07:57.120 --> 01:07:58.180
明白不？ 没人在乎！
All right? Nobody give a shit!


1351
01:07:58.180 --> 01:07:59.880
揍他!
Whoop his ass!


1352
01:07:59.890 --> 01:08:02.050
然后 有一天 突然出现了这么个 在乎你的姑娘
And then the one girl who do actually care about you...


1353
01:08:02.050 --> 01:08:03.250
你却来这儿
...you wanna come over here and


1354
01:08:03.250 --> 01:08:05.990
跟我抱怨什么电影?
bitch and whine about some films, yo? Huh?


1355
01:08:05.990 --> 01:08:08.290
你抱怨是因为有人在乎你吗?
Because somebody actually cares about you?


1356
01:08:08.290 --> 01:08:09.860
该死 我真是烦死你了
Like, damn, I'm so tired of you


1357
01:08:09.860 --> 01:08:11.690
你对她好像是你的负担一样
treating this girl like she a burden.


1358
01:08:11.700 --> 01:08:13.590
你明白吗 她马上就要死了!
You know, her life is over after this!


1359
01:08:13.600 --> 01:08:14.960
你却跑过来
And you want to come over here


1360
01:08:14.960 --> 01:08:18.030
跟我抱怨这些八竿子打不着的!
bitchin' and whinin' about some irrelevant bullshit!


1361
01:08:18.030 --> 01:08:19.900
你最好离我远点 否则我真的要打你了!
Like, yo, you so close to me knocking your shit loose right now, son!


1362
01:08:19.900 --> 01:08:21.270
来啊!
Go for it!


1363
01:08:21.270 --> 01:08:24.340
- 我才不在乎! 你想让我打你吗？
Yeah, I don't care! You want me to hit you now?


1364
01:08:24.340 --> 01:08:26.140
是的 Earl 我想!
Yeah, Earl, I want you to!


1365
01:08:26.140 --> 01:08:27.770
这才对! 把这小鬼打趴下!
That's right! Jack that little dude up there!


1366
01:08:33.310 --> 01:08:34.940
看见没 Greg?
See, Greg?


1367
01:08:34.940 --> 01:08:37.780
还好是他打的你 不是我
You lucky that was him and not me out there...


1368
01:08:37.780 --> 01:08:39.810
不然我会追着你满街跑
...'cause I'd have been whooping your ass up and down this street.


1369
01:08:39.820 --> 01:08:41.050
绝对把你打出翔来 明白？
It'd have been a ass-whoopin' fest around here, you dig?


1370
01:08:50.860 --> 01:08:53.760
这么说 你20页的尼克松论文写得怎样了?
So what's the status on the 20-pager on Nixon?


1371
01:08:55.030 --> 01:08:58.660
呃 能再宽限几天吗
Uh, I need another extension.


1372
01:08:58.660 --> 01:09:00.760
应该不太可能了
That might prove difficult...


1373
01:09:00.760 --> 01:09:03.330
马上就到期末了
...seeing how it's the...


1374
01:09:03.330 --> 01:09:04.270
没法再延了
...the end of the quarter and all.


1375
01:09:05.700 --> 01:09:08.270
我知道 我只是很忙
Yeah, I've just been busy.


1376
01:09:10.370 --> 01:09:12.070
这样 我听说了一些
You know, I heard...


1377
01:09:15.770 --> 01:09:16.970
Rachel的事
...about Rachel.


1378
01:09:18.180 --> 01:09:19.710
你还好吗?
How you holding up?


1379
01:09:23.950 --> 01:09:24.880
你知道的...
You know...


1380
01:09:26.250 --> 01:09:27.720
...不好
...not great.


1381
01:09:33.390 --> 01:09:37.120
你知道吗 Greg 我爸在15岁的时候去世了
You know, my dad died when I was 15, Greg.


1382
01:09:37.130 --> 01:09:39.830
比你这时候还小几岁
A couple years younger than you.


1383
01:09:39.830 --> 01:09:42.330
但是 当我还是个孩子的时候
You know, the thing is that, when I was a kid...


1384
01:09:43.360 --> 01:09:46.130
我唯一能记起来的
...I really, I really can only remember


1385
01:09:46.130 --> 01:09:48.230
关于他的事情
thinking about him as this...


1386
01:09:48.240 --> 01:09:51.100
就是 他是个彻彻底底的大混蛋
...you know, big, kind of like asshole guy.


1387
01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:55.140
在守灵式上 他的朋友们
At his wake, these buddies of his


1388
01:09:55.140 --> 01:09:56.410
会过来找我说话
kept coming up to me...


1389
01:09:56.410 --> 01:09:59.310
给我讲很多他的故事
...and telling me these stories about him.


1390
01:09:59.310 --> 01:10:01.310
他们说的那些
And it was like they were talking about


1391
01:10:01.310 --> 01:10:02.980
对我来说 完全是另外一个人
some complete other guy.


1392
01:10:04.710 --> 01:10:06.150
比如
To give you an example.


1393
01:10:07.280 --> 01:10:10.220
他会唱每一首七十年代的
He knew every single European pop song


1394
01:10:10.220 --> 01:10:11.850
流行歌曲
from the 1970s.


1395
01:10:13.990 --> 01:10:15.320
他学会那些歌
He'd memorize these songs,


1396
01:10:15.320 --> 01:10:17.390
好在酒吧里
and he'd do that so he could go...


1397
01:10:17.390 --> 01:10:19.920
给德国姑娘们唱
...and sing them to German girls in bars.


1398
01:10:21.060 --> 01:10:22.720
他有自己的最爱
He had a go-to,


1399
01:10:22.730 --> 01:10:24.860
他的K歌首选
his number one go-to song. It was a...


1400
01:10:26.260 --> 01:10:30.000
是一首德语歌 叫Ding-a-Dong
It was a Dutch song. It was called Ding-a-Dong.


1401
01:10:32.200 --> 01:10:35.270
我爸经常给酒吧里的德国姑娘们唱这歌
My dad used to sing that to German girls in bars.


1402
01:10:36.740 --> 01:10:38.170
这是事实
That's a fact.


1403
01:10:42.010 --> 01:10:43.670
你说这些是什么意思？
So what does that mean?


1404
01:10:46.710 --> 01:10:48.980
Greg 我只是说
Well, Greg, I think that it just means that...


1405
01:10:50.410 --> 01:10:52.380
即使一个人已经不在这世上
...even after somebody dies, you can...


1406
01:10:53.880 --> 01:10:55.750
你仍然可以了解他们的不同侧面
...you can still keep learning about them.


1407
01:10:56.980 --> 01:10:59.350
他们的生活
You know, their life.


1408
01:11:01.860 --> 01:11:04.360
会一点一点地向你展现
It can keep unfolding itself to you just as long...


1409
01:11:05.960 --> 01:11:07.960
只要你真正留心注意
...just as long as you pay attention to it.


1410
01:11:09.460 --> 01:11:10.890
你真的要把这变成
Are you seriously trying to turn this


1411
01:11:10.900 --> 01:11:13.060
愚蠢的伤感课程吗?
into some stupid sappy lesson?


1412
01:11:15.430 --> 01:11:17.130
你是个好孩子 Greg
You're a good kid, Greg.


1413
01:11:17.130 --> 01:11:19.330
不! 听着 我要回家了
No! Look, I'm going home.


1414
01:11:21.340 --> 01:11:23.870
我要当着你的面逃课 看见没?
See, I'm cutting class right in front of you. 'Kay?


1415
01:11:23.870 --> 01:11:26.210
我不是个好孩子！不是！
I'm not a good kid. I'm not.


1416
01:11:43.390 --> 01:11:44.260
好吧
Okay.


1417
01:11:45.490 --> 01:11:47.760
Earl刚来过 送了点东西给我们
Earl came by earlier to drop something off...


1418
01:11:47.760 --> 01:11:49.860
但是他拒绝了我做的
...but he turned down this superb


1419
01:11:49.860 --> 01:11:52.030
超级超级美味的熏辣兔肉肠
Andouille rabbit sausage...


1420
01:11:52.030 --> 01:11:53.760
有点反常
...which is quite unlike him.


1421
01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:56.300
你们没事吧?
Is everything all right?


1422
01:11:57.900 --> 01:11:59.000
哥们?
Buddy?


1423
01:12:06.700 --> 01:12:08.000
我不干了

1424
01:12:18.080 --> 01:12:19.320
嗨 Rachel 我们尝试了很多种方式
We tried a lot of different ways


1425
01:12:19.320 --> 01:12:21.350
给你拍一部电影
of making a film for you...


1426
01:12:21.350 --> 01:12:24.090
但是都太傻气 太没意思了
...but they were all too goofy or irrelevant...


1427
01:12:24.090 --> 01:12:26.060
也不是我们想要的效果
...or just not what we wanted.


1428
01:12:26.060 --> 01:12:28.120
所以 我就跟你直说了我的心里话吧
So, now I'm gonna talk to you directly.


1429
01:12:28.990 --> 01:12:30.790
呃...
Um...


1430
01:12:30.790 --> 01:12:33.190
好吧 我说实话了啊
All right, I'm gonna be honest here. Okay?


1431
01:12:33.200 --> 01:12:35.530
我觉得 有些时候 白人女孩真的很傻
Sometimes, white girls are particularly stupid.


1432
01:12:35.530 --> 01:12:40.000
我是说 这是个傻逼的世界 但是白人姑娘
I mean, everybody's stupid, but white girls, you know...


1433
01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:41.770
都觉得自己高别人一等
They think they better than everybody


1434
01:12:41.770 --> 01:12:43.770
超级以自我为中心 还假装没有
and self-centered and pretend they not.


1435
01:12:43.770 --> 01:12:46.110
但是...
But...


1436
01:12:46.110 --> 01:12:47.410
你不是那样的
you aren't like that, you know. Um...


1437
01:12:48.840 --> 01:12:50.940
你的耐心让我惊叹
It's just crazy how patient you've been.


1438
01:12:50.940 --> 01:12:53.110
如果患癌的是我
You know, I know if it was me that had cancer, uh...


1439
01:12:54.280 --> 01:12:56.980
我会超级苦恼 超级生气
...I'd be upset and angry


1440
01:12:56.980 --> 01:13:00.020
大部分时间会想暴揍每一个人
and trying to beat everybody's ass half the time.


1441
01:13:00.020 --> 01:13:03.120
所以我真的很惊叹于你的耐心
So I'm just, I'm just amazed at how patient you've been.


1442
01:13:05.790 --> 01:13:07.560
你让我觉得我很幸运
You, you make me feel blessed.


1443
01:13:17.930 --> 01:13:21.270
By Michael Powell
and Emeric Pressburger.


1444
01:13:24.370 --> 01:13:26.100
I think, ultimately,
what one has to understand
watching this film...


1445
01:13:28.440 --> 01:13:30.370
哦
...it's a very special
piece of filmmaking.
Oh.


1446
01:13:30.380 --> 01:13:32.010
你还在这里吃午饭吗?
Are you eating lunch in here still?


1447
01:13:33.180 --> 01:13:35.440
你在的话我就不在了
Not if you are.


1448
01:13:35.450 --> 01:13:36.650
没关系 你在这吃的话那我就不在了
Well, I'm not eating lunch in here if you are.


1449
01:13:38.210 --> 01:13:41.080
那好 我挺喜欢这里的
Good, 'cause I like it in here.


1450
01:13:41.080 --> 01:13:43.020
那 我就走了
So I guess I could just go.


1451
01:13:44.090 --> 01:13:45.020
或者你走
Or you could go.


1452
01:13:46.050 --> 01:13:48.650
不 我要待在空调房
No, I like the air-conditioner.


1453
01:13:48.660 --> 01:13:50.220
这椅子也很舒服
And I like the comfortable chair.


1454
01:13:54.360 --> 01:13:56.430
是啊 我也喜欢
Yeah, I like those too.


1455
01:13:57.560 --> 01:13:59.660
那就是你的问题了
Sounds like your damn problem.


1456
01:14:02.130 --> 01:14:04.430
Which showed
one film per week...


1457
01:14:04.440 --> 01:14:06.600
...twice a night,
and three times on Saturday.


1458
01:14:13.940 --> 01:14:16.140
In a way,
Tales of Hoffmann is...
...the culmination of
Powell-Pressburger's work...
...with what they call
the composed film.


1459
01:14:37.430 --> 01:14:39.300
嘿!
Hey!


1460
01:14:39.300 --> 01:14:40.200
我能跟你谈谈电影的事吗?
Can I talk to you about the movie?


1461
01:14:41.030 --> 01:14:42.300
呃...
Um...


1462
01:14:42.300 --> 01:14:44.270
还没拍完呢
Yeah, it's not done yet.


1463
01:14:44.270 --> 01:14:45.330
Greg 你们都在一起拍了
Greg, you guys have been working on it


1464
01:14:45.340 --> 01:14:46.500
大概四个月了
for like four months.


1465
01:14:48.040 --> 01:14:50.140
是...
Yeah, well...


1466
01:14:50.140 --> 01:14:51.070
我也说不好 我们一起试了很多种方式
I don't know, we tried a bunch of stuff


1467
01:14:51.070 --> 01:14:52.640
但是...
and it just...


1468
01:14:53.340 --> 01:14:54.570
就是不怎么管用
...didn't really work.


1469
01:14:54.570 --> 01:14:55.470
不够好
It's not that good.


1470
01:14:55.470 --> 01:14:57.170
Greg!
Greg!


1471
01:14:57.180 --> 01:14:59.610
现在不是你说 "大家好 我是Greg 我好烂
Now is not the time for your "I'm Greg, I suck,


1472
01:14:59.610 --> 01:15:01.280
"我啥事都干不好" 的时候
"nothing I do is any good" thing.


1473
01:15:01.280 --> 01:15:02.580
我敢肯定你的电影很棒
I'm sure what you have is awesome


1474
01:15:02.580 --> 01:15:04.610
而且如果你早点搞完 给Rachel看的话
and I think she would really benefit...


1475
01:15:04.610 --> 01:15:06.510
她一定可以吸取正能量
...if you just got it done and gave it to her.


1476
01:15:07.680 --> 01:15:09.380
Madison 她停止化疗了
Madison, she stopped treatment.


1477
01:15:12.580 --> 01:15:13.580
她放弃了
She gave up.


1478
01:15:15.750 --> 01:15:17.250
她退出了
She quit.


1479
01:15:19.660 --> 01:15:21.190
那你就更应该
Well, I guess that's a really good reason


1480
01:15:21.190 --> 01:15:22.460
早点弄完你的电影
to just finish the fucking movie.


1481
01:15:22.460 --> 01:15:23.660
然后放给她看！
And give it to her.


1482
01:15:26.060 --> 01:15:27.230
不过无所谓了
But whatever.


1483
01:15:40.240 --> 01:15:41.470
亲爱的?
Honey?


1484
01:15:43.280 --> 01:15:44.310
干嘛?
What?


1485
01:15:50.350 --> 01:15:52.250
Rachel又住院了
Rachel's back in the hospital, honey.


1486
01:15:56.720 --> 01:15:58.620
等等 你是说她又开始化疗了?
Wait, is she starting treatment again?


1487
01:16:01.320 --> 01:16:03.190
不是的 亲爱的
It's not for treatment, honey.


1488
01:16:08.290 --> 01:16:09.030
哦
Oh.


1489
01:16:13.100 --> 01:16:14.400
妈 怎么了?
Mom, what?


1490
01:16:15.530 --> 01:16:17.100
我只是觉得我们应该过去
Well, I thought we could go and...


1491
01:16:17.100 --> 01:16:19.800
你要抓住这最后的机会 逼我跟她一起玩?
To force me to hang out with her?


1492
01:16:19.800 --> 01:16:21.300
Greg 别这样
Greg, come on.


1493
01:16:21.310 --> 01:16:22.500
别担心 妈 我肯定
Don't worry, Mom, I'm sure you can find


1494
01:16:22.510 --> 01:16:24.340
Rachel死后你会再给我找个患癌少女的
another girl with cancer after Rachel dies.


1495
01:16:26.040 --> 01:16:27.570
还有
Which, by the way...


1496
01:16:28.240 --> 01:16:29.710
这是她自己决定的
...she's decided to do.


1497
01:16:32.250 --> 01:16:34.750
她决定要死
She's just decided to die...


1498
01:16:34.750 --> 01:16:37.420
那我也可以决定不去看她
...so maybe I can decide not to visit her.


1499
01:16:43.090 --> 01:16:46.060
我保证 如果不去看她的话
I promise you, you will regret that...


1500
01:16:46.060 --> 01:16:47.060
你会后悔的
...if you don't visit her.


1501
01:16:48.460 --> 01:16:50.260
你会遗憾终生的
You'll regret it for the rest of your life.


1502
01:16:50.260 --> 01:16:52.060
妈 这你倒没说错
Mom, that's probably true.


1503
01:16:52.060 --> 01:16:53.290
但说真的 我还有一大堆破事
But honestly, I have a shitload of things


1504
01:16:53.300 --> 01:16:55.300
等着我去后悔
to regret right now.


1505
01:16:55.300 --> 01:16:57.560
我后悔明天的傻逼舞会没有舞伴
I regret not having a date for tomorrow's stupid prom.


1506
01:16:57.570 --> 01:17:00.300
我后悔我怪里怪气交不到朋友
I regret being too weird to make friends.


1507
01:17:00.300 --> 01:17:01.470
还有我超级超级后悔
I definitely regret making


1508
01:17:01.470 --> 01:17:03.130
跟Earl拍那堆烂电影
all those shitty films with Earl.


1509
01:17:03.140 --> 01:17:05.100
而且我猜你已经看到从匹茨堡大学 来的那封邮件了 是吧?
And I assume you saw the email I got today, from Pitt?


1510
01:17:06.540 --> 01:17:08.240
没有? 你偷看我东西的时候
Oh, no? You didn't see it


1511
01:17:08.240 --> 01:17:09.400
没看见吗? 看
while you're going though all my shit? Here.


1512
01:17:09.710 --> 01:17:11.640
看看
Have a look.


1513
01:17:11.640 --> 01:17:13.140
我绝对绝对会后悔
I'm definitely gonna regret


1514
01:17:13.140 --> 01:17:14.510
这一学年完全没去上学!
doing literally no school work this year!


1515
01:17:15.110 --> 01:17:16.410
天啊 Greg
Oh, my God, Greg.


1516
01:17:16.410 --> 01:17:18.440
我知道 录取取消
I know. Admission rescinded,


1517
01:17:18.450 --> 01:17:20.550
因为我这一年成绩飞流直下
due to significant change in my academic record.


1518
01:17:20.550 --> 01:17:22.410
太好了 明年没大学可上
Oh, well, no college next year.


1519
01:17:22.420 --> 01:17:24.350
我估计都要待在家里了 对你来说太烂了
I guess I'll just be home, which sucks for you...


1520
01:17:24.350 --> 01:17:25.320
因为这样 你就不能
...because it's gonna be so hard for you


1521
01:17:25.320 --> 01:17:27.120
偷看我的东西了
to go through all my stuff.


1522
01:17:27.120 --> 01:17:28.590
你能帮我个忙吗 妈?
Can you just do me a favor right now, Mom?


1523
01:17:28.590 --> 01:17:30.250
让我一个人静一静 好吗?
Just leave me alone. Okay?


1524
01:17:30.260 --> 01:17:31.850
让我坐在这儿后悔吧
Just let me sit here and regret stuff.


1525
01:17:31.860 --> 01:17:33.220
我要回想
I'm just gonna think about


1526
01:17:33.220 --> 01:17:34.320
我做过的和没做过的
all the things that I've ever done...


1527
01:17:34.330 --> 01:17:35.760
所有事情
...and all the things I haven't done


1528
01:17:35.760 --> 01:17:37.830
然后狠狠地后悔一场 行不?
and just regret the living shit out of it. Okay?


1529
01:17:43.300 --> 01:17:45.470
所有日期都截止了 Victor
All the deadlines have passed, Victor.


1530
01:17:45.470 --> 01:17:46.730
他明年要怎么办?
What's he gonna do next year?


1531
01:17:46.730 --> 01:17:48.200
他要浪费掉整整一年吗?
He's just gonna waste the year?


1532
01:17:48.200 --> 01:17:49.500
他在难过呢 亲爱的
He is grieving, honey.


1533
01:17:49.500 --> 01:17:50.800
你让他难过一下嘛
You have to let him grieve.


1534
01:17:50.800 --> 01:17:51.800
那我不能干坐着
But I can't just sit by


1535
01:17:51.810 --> 01:17:53.540
看他毁掉自己的生活啊
and just let him ruin his life.


1536
01:17:53.540 --> 01:17:56.740
宇宙又不会因为
The universe does not operate


1537
01:17:56.740 --> 01:17:58.340
一个大学申请而停转!
according to a college deadline!


1538
01:18:17.630 --> 01:18:18.730
我能问你件事吗?
Can I ask you something?


1539
01:18:20.230 --> 01:18:21.600
不行
Nope.


1540
01:18:21.600 --> 01:18:23.230
不 不是你想的那种问题
No. It's not what you think.


1541
01:18:23.230 --> 01:18:24.470
我只是想问 舞会就是今晚
It's just that prom is tonight and...


1542
01:18:24.470 --> 01:18:26.600
让我问问你吧 这是干嘛?
Let me ask you something. What is this?


1543
01:18:27.570 --> 01:18:29.470
你碰我胳膊干嘛?
What is up with the arm touching?


1544
01:18:29.470 --> 01:18:30.670
你只是想表现友好吗？
Are you just being friendly,


1545
01:18:30.670 --> 01:18:32.140
还是你耍的什么花招
or is this some calculated maneuver...


1546
01:18:32.140 --> 01:18:33.540
为了让我满足你的要求?
...to get me to do whatever you want?


1547
01:18:33.540 --> 01:18:34.770
你要知道 这种行为
'Cause you have to understand


1548
01:18:34.770 --> 01:18:36.540
当一个漂亮性感
what it does when a beautiful, sexy...


1549
01:18:36.540 --> 01:18:37.740
还很聪明的女孩
...otherwise thoughtful girl...


1550
01:18:37.740 --> 01:18:39.640
触碰一个瘦骨嶙峋 苍白的
...touches the arm of a scrawny, pasty


1551
01:18:39.640 --> 01:18:40.810
丑男生的手臂时 意味着什么
groundhog-faced kid.


1552
01:18:40.810 --> 01:18:41.910
这是一种残忍的行为
It's an act of cruelty.


1553
01:18:42.910 --> 01:18:44.410
你说完了?
Are you done?


1554
01:18:44.410 --> 01:18:45.610
是 我说完了
Yeah. Yeah, I'm done.


1555
01:18:45.620 --> 01:18:47.350
我受够你了
I'm done with you.


1556
01:18:47.350 --> 01:18:49.550
也受够了这部愚蠢的电影
I'm done with this stupid film.


1557
01:18:49.550 --> 01:18:50.920
行吗? 我受够了
All right? I'm done.


1558
01:18:52.520 --> 01:18:54.220
嘿! 咱俩还没完呢!
Yo! But you ain't done with me!


1559
01:18:54.220 --> 01:18:55.550
我回来复仇了！
I'm back for my revenge


1560
01:18:55.560 --> 01:18:56.820
直戳进你的鸡鸡
Stab you in the dick


1561
01:18:56.820 --> 01:18:58.560
抱歉说脏话了
Pardon my French


1562
01:18:58.560 --> 01:19:00.890
真的? 你要直戳我的鸡鸡? 来吧
Really? You're gonna stab me in the dick? Go ahead.


1563
01:19:00.890 --> 01:19:02.260
来直戳我的鸡鸡
Stab me in the dick.


1564
01:19:02.260 --> 01:19:04.930
只是别玩饶舌好吗?
Just no rapping. Okay? All right?


1565
01:19:04.930 --> 01:19:06.460
我要用我紧握的拳头
I'll break your eyeball


1566
01:19:06.460 --> 01:19:07.630
打碎你的眼球
with a fist I got clenched


1567
01:19:07.630 --> 01:19:09.430
把你摔倒在长凳下面
Shove your body under another bench


1568
01:19:09.430 --> 01:19:11.230
不要饶舌了!
Stop rapping!


1569
01:19:11.230 --> 01:19:13.230
用我紧握的拳头 把你一嘴牙都打掉
Knock your teeth out with the fist I got clenched


1570
01:19:13.240 --> 01:19:14.200
你要是一直饶舌的话 那我走人了
I can't do this if you're gonna rap the whole time.


1571
01:19:32.350 --> 01:19:33.480
啊!
Aw!


1572
01:19:36.320 --> 01:19:37.420
让开!
Break it up!


1573
01:19:37.420 --> 01:19:38.750
Earl!
Earl!


1574
01:19:38.760 --> 01:19:41.360
让开! 让开!
Break it up! Break it up!


1575
01:19:41.360 --> 01:19:42.360
你不是在McCarthy先生的办公室
I thought you were eating lunch


1576
01:19:42.360 --> 01:19:43.520
吃午饭吗
in Mr. McCarthy's office.


1577
01:19:43.530 --> 01:19:44.760
我是在吃午饭 但是他一直在唠唠叨叨
Man, I was, but he all sad talking


1578
01:19:44.760 --> 01:19:45.890
说一堆德国音乐之类的事情
about German music and shit.


1579
01:19:45.890 --> 01:19:48.190
真是无聊透了
That's boring as hell, man.


1580
01:19:48.200 --> 01:19:50.730
看到你们俩打架 我真是既惊喜又失望
I'm surprised and disappointed to see you two fighting.


1581
01:19:50.730 --> 01:19:52.460
我看到你回到学校
Phillip, And, Phillip, I'm surprised and disappointed


1582
01:19:52.470 --> 01:19:53.760
也是既惊喜又失望
to see you back on school grounds...


1583
01:19:53.770 --> 01:19:55.400
你已经被开除了!
...after being expelled!


1584
01:19:55.400 --> 01:19:56.670
好吧
All right, man.


1585
01:19:56.670 --> 01:19:57.500
请离开学校！
Please leave the premises.


1586
01:19:57.500 --> 01:19:58.830
回教室去吧
Back to class.


1587
01:19:58.840 --> 01:20:00.370
走吧
Let's go!


1588
01:20:00.370 --> 01:20:02.500
Maxwell, Ryan, Soledad
Maxwell, Ryan, Soledad,


1589
01:20:02.500 --> 01:20:04.770
别呆着不动了 走吧!

1590
01:20:09.640 --> 01:20:11.410
Greg!
Greg!


1591
01:20:11.410 --> 01:20:13.740
嘿 姑娘 你看见我打那个娘娘腔没?
Yo, babe! You see me pummel this bitch?


1592
01:20:13.750 --> 01:20:14.980
快滚
Come on and keep walking


1593
01:20:14.980 --> 01:20:16.680
小心我再打你
'fore I can whoop that ass again, man.


1594
01:20:16.680 --> 01:20:18.010
干嘛 Madison?
Madison, what?


1595
01:20:19.080 --> 01:20:20.550
今晚和我一起去舞会吧
Come to prom with me.


1596
01:20:22.980 --> 01:20:24.620
我知道拍电影这事
I know the whole movie situation


1597
01:20:24.620 --> 01:20:26.420
对你来说并不容易
was really difficult for you...


1598
01:20:26.420 --> 01:20:27.820
我总觉得这是我的错
...and I kind of feel like it was my fault.


1599
01:20:29.050 --> 01:20:30.450
所以 我只是想
So I just kind of wanted to


1600
01:20:30.460 --> 01:20:31.620
对你做点补偿
make it up to you a little bit.


1601
01:20:34.020 --> 01:20:35.820
你是可怜我才约我吗?
Is this a pity date?


1602
01:20:35.830 --> 01:20:37.090
不是
No.


1603
01:20:37.090 --> 01:20:38.630
我不是因为可怜你才约你
No, it's not a pity date.


1604
01:20:40.590 --> 01:20:41.790
Greg 和我一起去舞会吧
Greg, just come to prom with me.


1605
01:20:41.800 --> 01:20:42.930
我们一起会很好玩的
I think we'd have a good time.


1606
01:20:46.030 --> 01:20:47.930
跟你说了你会找到舞伴的吧
Told you you would get a date.


1607
01:20:48.800 --> 01:20:49.770
是
Yep.


1608
01:20:55.640 --> 01:20:58.470
西装什么的你就别谢我啦
So you're welcome. For the tux and everything.


1609
01:20:59.740 --> 01:21:00.910
谢谢了 妈
Thanks, Mom.


1610
01:21:16.360 --> 01:21:18.960
对于你大学的事情 我很生气
I'm very upset about this college thing.


1611
01:21:20.830 --> 01:21:22.460
但是你爸说可以等一等
But your father and I can wait


1612
01:21:22.460 --> 01:21:23.790
你准备好了我们再谈
till you're ready to talk about it.


1613
01:21:26.360 --> 01:21:27.630
谢谢
I appreciate that.


1614
01:21:30.670 --> 01:21:32.470
别忘了带女生的胸花
Don't forget your corsage.


1615
01:21:35.570 --> 01:21:36.500
好
All right.


1616
01:21:42.410 --> 01:21:44.740
我的帅儿子
My handsome boy...


1617
01:21:44.750 --> 01:21:46.380
要去舞会啦
...going to prom.


1618
01:21:49.120 --> 01:21:51.120
多拍几张照片 好吗?
Take lots of pictures, okay?


1619
01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:11.070
Halket街302号

1620
01:22:11.600 --> 01:22:13.030
什么?
What's that?


1621
01:22:13.040 --> 01:22:14.570
我说 Halket街302号
I said 302 Halket Street.


1622
01:22:15.040 --> 01:22:16.670
哈?
Huh?


1623
01:22:16.670 --> 01:22:18.070
Halket街302号

1624
01:22:18.070 --> 01:22:19.940
Halket街? 好吧 - 好
Halket? Okay. Okay.


1625
01:22:19.940 --> 01:22:21.610
知道了
You got it, baby.


1626
01:22:21.610 --> 01:22:23.070
你很喜欢这女孩吗?
So you love this girl?


1627
01:22:24.810 --> 01:22:26.710
呃 没有 还没到那一步
Uh, no. I wouldn't go that far.


1628
01:22:26.980 --> 01:22:28.410
什么?
What?


1629
01:22:28.410 --> 01:22:30.440
我- 没有啦
No. I... No.


1630
01:22:30.450 --> 01:22:31.510
这样 那你们会在我
Yeah, so you guys are gonna be getting busy


1631
01:22:31.510 --> 01:22:33.450
新换的托斯卡纳皮座上亲热吗?
on my brand new Tuscan leather?


1632
01:22:33.450 --> 01:22:35.480
- 不 我觉得 - 啥?
No. I think... Huh?


1633
01:22:35.480 --> 01:22:37.080
不 我们不会的
No, we're not. I don't think so.


1634
01:22:37.080 --> 01:22:39.020
没有啦 我只是逗你玩
Nah, I'm just playing with you.


1635
01:22:39.020 --> 01:22:41.020
但是我希望你有这个机会哟
But I do hope you get some.


1636
01:22:41.020 --> 01:22:42.950
嗯 一切都听她的
It's really gonna depend on what she wants to do.


1637
01:22:42.960 --> 01:22:43.960
如果你真心喜欢她的话
If you really love her, though,


1638
01:22:43.960 --> 01:22:45.520
那肯定有机会的
you definitely got a shot.


1639
01:22:45.530 --> 01:22:46.890
因为她会知道的
Because she'll know.


1640
01:22:47.860 --> 01:22:49.460
她挺好的吧?
She is fine though?


1641
01:22:50.990 --> 01:22:51.960
是吗?
Huh?


1642
01:23:18.690 --> 01:23:20.960
失败的友谊：第209天

1643
01:23:54.820 --> 01:23:55.920
嘿
Hey.


1644
01:23:59.860 --> 01:24:01.130
我知道 我帅极了
I know, I look amazing.


1645
01:24:06.060 --> 01:24:07.800
我能给你戴上花吗?
Can I put some flowers on you?


1646
01:24:22.950 --> 01:24:24.550
这样
Like that.


1647
01:24:32.520 --> 01:24:33.550
好的
Okay.


1648
01:24:34.620 --> 01:24:37.290
我们看这部片子之前
Before we watch this...


1649
01:24:37.290 --> 01:24:39.590
我想道歉 我花了太久了
...I'm sorry it took so long to make.


1650
01:24:39.590 --> 01:24:42.090
但是 是因为
But the reason is...


1651
01:24:42.100 --> 01:24:44.860
我只是想拍一部不烂的电影
...just couldn't figure out how to get it to not suck.


1652
01:24:46.230 --> 01:24:49.300
但是 到头来 我也没找到合适的方式
But... we never really did figure it out.


1653
01:24:49.300 --> 01:24:50.730
这片依旧很烂
It still sucks.


1654
01:24:55.570 --> 01:24:57.610
我不是真的想跟你说这些
It's not exactly what I wanted to say to you.


1655
01:25:04.210 --> 01:25:05.150
但是...
But...


1656
01:25:06.710 --> 01:25:08.580
...爱谁谁吧
...whatever.


1657
01:25:08.580 --> 01:25:10.280
我们还是先看片吧
Let's just watch this first, okay?


1658
01:28:24.010 --> 01:28:25.470
我该叫护士来吗?
Hey, should I get a nurse?


1659
01:28:27.480 --> 01:28:29.480
Denise! Denise!
Denise! Denise!


1660
01:29:41.980 --> 01:29:43.990
那是我最后一次见到Rachel
That was the last time I saw Rachel.


1661
01:29:45.290 --> 01:29:47.520
不久后 她昏迷了
She went into a coma shortly after that,


1662
01:29:47.520 --> 01:29:48.990
大概过了十个小时 她就死了
and died about 10 hours later.


1663
01:29:52.260 --> 01:29:54.130
我知道 我说过了她没有死
I know I told you she doesn't die.


1664
01:29:54.890 --> 01:29:56.160
很抱歉
And I'm sorry.


1665
01:29:56.900 --> 01:29:58.600
在我心里
Deep down...


1666
01:29:58.600 --> 01:30:01.160
我总觉得 她没有死
...somehow, I didn't think she would.


1667
01:30:02.930 --> 01:30:04.200
但是 她死了
But she did.


1668
01:32:59.930 --> 01:33:05.200
这是其他部分之后的最后尾声

1669
01:33:30.770 --> 01:33:32.700
亲爱的Greg 我听说了
Dear Greg, I heard what happened


1670
01:33:32.700 --> 01:33:34.170
在学校的事
with your class work.


1671
01:33:34.170 --> 01:33:35.500
还有你大学的事
And with Pitt State.


1672
01:33:36.410 --> 01:33:38.370
所以 我给他们写了一封信
So, I wrote them a letter,


1673
01:33:38.370 --> 01:33:40.140
想说服他们重新录取你
trying to convince them to let you back in.


1674
01:33:41.310 --> 01:33:44.440
如果你想读的话 这里有副本
There's a copy in here, if you want to read it.


1675
01:33:44.450 --> 01:33:46.240
真希望能管用 因为这说明
Hopefully, it works, because that would mean...


1676
01:33:46.250 --> 01:33:49.180
在坟墓下的我 有可以帮助你的灵力
...I have powers from beyond the grave.


1677
01:33:49.180 --> 01:33:51.250
但我觉得你也应该给他们写封信
But you should probably send them something too.


1678
01:33:53.080 --> 01:33:56.390
再见了 Greg 你是个好朋友
Goodbye, Greg. You're a good friend.


1679
01:33:56.390 --> 01:33:57.490
不过你如果不去上大学的话
Although if you don't go to college,


1680
01:33:57.490 --> 01:33:59.120
你还是个傻瓜
you're also an idiot.


1681
01:33:59.120 --> 01:34:00.660
不过这个你已经知道了
But you already knew that.


1682
01:34:01.660 --> 01:34:02.790
爱你的 Rachel
Love, Rachel.


1683
01:34:05.290 --> 01:34:08.660
又及 我还想送你几个我的枕头
I'd also like for you to take some of my pillows.


1684
01:34:08.660 --> 01:34:11.360
它们可能会想找个好人家 找到一个被爱的地方
They'll want a good home where they'll be loved.


1685
01:34:11.370 --> 01:34:13.330
又又及 不是因为你想的那个原因哦
Not in the way you're thinking,


1686
01:34:13.330 --> 01:34:14.170
那太恶心了
that's disgusting.


1687
01:37:49.610 --> 01:37:51.850
敬爱的匹茨堡州立大学招生部
Dear Pittsburgh State Admissions:


1688
01:37:51.850 --> 01:37:53.550
我代表这么个人 给你们写信
I'm writing on behalf of someone


1689
01:37:53.550 --> 01:37:55.320
他用自己生命中一年半的时间
who gave me half a year of his life...


1690
01:37:55.320 --> 01:37:56.580
在我最难以陪伴的时候
...at the time when I was at


1691
01:37:56.580 --> 01:37:58.820
一直陪着我
my most difficult to be around.


1692
01:37:58.820 --> 01:38:00.950
他对自己非常不自信
He has a very low opinion of himself,


1693
01:38:00.950 --> 01:38:02.020
所以我认为 你们能收到一个
which is why I think it's necessary...


1694
01:38:02.020 --> 01:38:03.490
能看到的真实的他的人的来信
...that you hear from someone


1695
01:38:03.490 --> 01:38:05.590
很有必要:
who sees him as he actually is:


1696
01:38:05.590 --> 01:38:07.860
他是个无限善良 贴心 甘于奉献
A limitlessly kind, sweet, giving,


1697
01:38:07.860 --> 01:38:09.890
并且真诚的人
and genuine person.


1698
01:38:09.890 --> 01:38:11.590
无论他自己怎么否认 都不能改变这一点
No matter how much he would deny it.


1699
01:38:12.760 --> 01:38:15.000
这一学年 他的成绩滑落
The drop in his academic performance this year...


1700
01:38:15.000 --> 01:38:16.000
主要是因为 这段时间
...is the consequence of all the time


1701
01:38:16.000 --> 01:38:19.900
他一直在试着让我开心
...and the time he spent making things for me...


1702
01:38:19.900 --> 01:38:22.030
而且这段时间让他很难过
...and how hard that was for him.


1703
01:38:22.040 --> 01:38:24.000
你可以向他求证
You can ask him about it...


1704
01:38:24.000 --> 01:38:26.040
但是他的自我厌恶
...but his sort of over-the-top humility


1705
01:38:26.040 --> 01:38:27.610
可能又要出来作怪了
will probably get in the way.


1706
01:38:27.610 --> 01:38:31.940
从没人能像他那样让我开心
No one has done more to make me smile than he has.


1707
01:38:31.940 --> 01:38:33.510
也再没有人能像他那样
And no one ever could.


1708
01:38:51.700 --> 01:38:52.930
Rachel的骨灰被抛洒在
Rachel's ashes were scattered


1709
01:38:52.930 --> 01:38:54.700
她家后面的一个公园里
in a park behind her house.


1710
01:38:55.830 --> 01:38:57.570
很显然 她曾离家出走过一次
Apparently, she ran away from home once


1711
01:38:57.570 --> 01:38:59.000
就想在那儿住来着
and tried to live there.


1712
01:39:00.870 --> 01:39:03.840
这个故事是她的姨姨在葬礼上讲的
It was this story her aunt told at the funeral.


1713
01:39:03.840 --> 01:39:05.770
她当时想成为一只松鼠
She was trying to become a squirrel.


1714
01:39:06.870 --> 01:39:08.040
所以她觉得 如果住在树林里
She thought she could turn into one


1715
01:39:08.040 --> 01:39:09.640
一直想着自己能变松鼠
just by being in the forest...


1716
01:39:09.640 --> 01:39:12.780
就真能变成松鼠
...and wanting it really bad.


1717
01:39:12.780 --> 01:39:15.880
我猜 这就是McCarthy先生所说的
I guess maybe that's what Mr. McCarthy meant...


1718
01:39:15.880 --> 01:39:18.480
一个人的一生 会不断地在你面前展开
...about someone's life continuing to unfold.


1719
01:39:19.920 --> 01:39:21.520
其实在Rachel死后 再听到她的新鲜事
It was weird to be learning something new


1720
01:39:21.520 --> 01:39:23.050
这感觉挺怪的
about Rachel after she died.


1721
01:39:24.650 --> 01:39:26.920
但是不知怎么 也让我感觉安心
But somehow, it was reassuring as well.
