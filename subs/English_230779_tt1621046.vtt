1
00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:27.382
I was born in Yuma, Arizona
in a ranch owned by my family


2
00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:29.861
but we lost it in the depression.

3
00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:35.110
Like many other families, we moved
to California to work in the fields.


4
00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:38.702
<i>But when we arrived, we found out that
there was more people than jobs.</i>


5
00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:42.984
<i>We went from being farm owners
to farm workers in one day.</i>


6
00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:47.502
<i>And at the age of 11,
I started working in the fields.</i>


7
00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:50.348
<i>That's where I witnessed,
for the first time,</i>


8
00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:54.266
<i>the injustice and the indignities
suffered by the farm workers.</i>


9
00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:58.707
<i>You see the problem is that in 1936
the country changed,</i>


10
00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:02.071
<i>because the National Labor Relations Act
went into effect.</i>


11
00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:06.988
And it gave most workers the right
to join the union and bargain collectively.


12
00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:09.469
Except the farm workers,

13
00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:14.023
they were excluded from this protection
and I was one of them.


14
00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:18.862
I wanted to do something, so I joined
the CSO, Community Services Organization.


15
00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:21.462
And that is where I learned
how to organize people.


16
00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:26.348
<i>We were working in the cities and I
realized that, to make a difference,</i>


17
00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:29.503
<i>I had to get out
and start organizing the workers.</i>


18
00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:33.665
<i>So, in 1962, I went back
to the fields to do just that.</i>


19
00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:38.423
Juan de la Cruz!

20
00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:43.665
I'm a friend of your cousin, Felipe.

21
00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:51.706
Are you Juan?

22
00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:53.381
Can we talk?

23
00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:56.186
Sure. But not here.

24
00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:03.740
I'm done in about four hours.

25
00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:15.390
You need to leave now. 
They're coming.

26
00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:27.550
Can I help you, sir?
Were you talking to those workers?


27
00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:30.426
Is there something I can do for you?

28
00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:33.184
I'm talking to you.

29
00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:42.381
Do you own anything?

30
00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:48.221
No.

31
00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:53.347
Can you read or write?

32
00:05:57.020 --> 00:05:58.465
Well... No.

33
00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:00.591
Of course not.

34
00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:10.347
Who in your family works?

35
00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:17.380
Me and my wife.

36
00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:22.505
And my kids. The older ones anyways.

37
00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:26.380
The other ones are still too young.

38
00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:31.421
Do you want more for your kids?

39
00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:34.944
Of course.

40
00:06:37.540 --> 00:06:38.871
But...

41
00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:46.341
Most of the people are afraid.

42
00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:51.583
They have to feed their kids.

43
00:06:58.740 --> 00:07:01.584
It's not easy doing it alone.

44
00:07:04.380 --> 00:07:09.068
I'll return in one month
to help you start organizing.


45
00:07:09.580 --> 00:07:12.629
But I need you to gather
everyone you can here.


46
00:07:17.540 --> 00:07:19.030
OK, that's fine.

47
00:07:20.060 --> 00:07:22.711
And you won't be alone anymore.

48
00:07:25.380 --> 00:07:27.223
If we want to organize farm workers,
if we're really serious,


49
00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:28.980
it's not gonna happen here, not with them.

50
00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:33.749
It's just one setback, Cesar, it takes a while
to build trust, you have to be patient.


51
00:07:33.820 --> 00:07:35.788
You know, they really don't care about
the farm worker, Fred.


52
00:07:35.900 --> 00:07:36.901
Gilbert, that's not true.

53
00:07:36.980 --> 00:07:40.348
See that's what I'm talking about, Fred,
see I have to be where it's happening.


54
00:07:40.420 --> 00:07:43.151
I have to get out of Los Angeles
and go back to the fields where I started.


55
00:07:43.220 --> 00:07:45.143
You know, we are doing this together, okay?

56
00:07:45.220 --> 00:07:47.382
You knew this could happen,
that is why we have a plan.


57
00:07:48.060 --> 00:07:49.346
But not in an office.

58
00:07:49.420 --> 00:07:50.706
It's not the time to walk out now.

59
00:07:50.780 --> 00:07:52.384
You know what it takes,
that is why I brought you in.


60
00:07:52.500 --> 00:07:55.947
The CSO will be behind you, no matter what,
but please at least sleep on it.


61
00:07:56.060 --> 00:07:57.266
I am not tired, Fred.

62
00:07:58.340 --> 00:07:59.830
I want to get my hands dirty.

63
00:08:00.660 --> 00:08:03.231
- Cesar...
- I'm with him. He's right.


64
00:08:05.380 --> 00:08:07.906
You will go to new schools
and make new friends.


65
00:08:09.420 --> 00:08:11.468
You're going to be fine.

66
00:08:12.500 --> 00:08:14.150
Your father and I
grew up on the fields.

67
00:08:14.220 --> 00:08:15.710
Which team plays for Delano?

68
00:08:15.780 --> 00:08:21.628
Your tio Ruc and tia Petra live in Delano,
so do our cousins. It's gonna be good.


69
00:08:22.100 --> 00:08:23.829
Okay, let's take a vote.

70
00:08:24.340 --> 00:08:26.422
Who wants to go to Delano?

71
00:08:37.660 --> 00:08:39.822
<i>...a wonderful day
in Southern California.</i>


72
00:08:39.940 --> 00:08:41.829
<i>- Sandy Koufax on the mound.
- No!</i>


73
00:08:41.940 --> 00:08:44.910
<i>Sandy coming off that
beautiful no-hitter last week.</i>


74
00:08:45.380 --> 00:08:48.065
<i>Caullison just waving that bat
back and forth.</i>


75
00:08:48.180 --> 00:08:50.148
<i>- Pare,</i> I <i>am trying</i> to listen to <i>the game.
- Koufax trying to keep</i>


76
00:08:50.220 --> 00:08:51.381
<i>his winning streak going.</i>

77
00:08:51.460 --> 00:08:54.191
Could you stop? Stop!

78
00:08:58.580 --> 00:09:01.345
<i>Top of the fourth,
Dodgers leading two to nothing.</i>


79
00:09:01.660 --> 00:09:06.188
<i>Koufax delivers and it's
a line drive down the left field line...</i>


80
00:09:06.300 --> 00:09:07.347
<i>Fair ball!</i>

81
00:09:13.540 --> 00:09:15.861
I can't hear. Can you turn it up?

82
00:09:16.460 --> 00:09:18.986
I think we, uh, lost the signal.

83
00:09:21.180 --> 00:09:22.466
You promised me a three-bedroom house.

84
00:09:22.540 --> 00:09:24.144
I said I would try, Mansi.
It was short notice.


85
00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:25.300
But I gave you two months.

86
00:09:25.660 --> 00:09:26.786
That's short notice!

87
00:09:26.860 --> 00:09:28.100
Uncle Cesar.

88
00:09:28.300 --> 00:09:30.780
- That goes in the bedroom, Chato.
- It doesn't fit.


89
00:09:30.860 --> 00:09:31.907
It doesn't fit.

90
00:09:31.980 --> 00:09:33.869
Hey, Cesar, we've lived in a lot worse.

91
00:09:33.940 --> 00:09:34.941
We'll be fine.

92
00:09:35.060 --> 00:09:36.346
Can you get the heavy stuff
in the truck please?


93
00:09:37.540 --> 00:09:40.510
If you put eight kids in that one car,
you can put them in that house!


94
00:09:41.100 --> 00:09:42.943
We can find a bigger one
in a couple of months.


95
00:09:43.060 --> 00:09:45.142
And then we gotta
move all over again?


96
00:10:12.540 --> 00:10:14.383
Forty-eight, forty-nine,

97
00:10:15.260 --> 00:10:16.750
fifty, fifty-one,

98
00:10:17.580 --> 00:10:18.945
fifty-two,

99
00:10:19.620 --> 00:10:20.985
fifty-three!

100
00:10:22.460 --> 00:10:23.461
That's all for today!

101
00:10:24.020 --> 00:10:26.181
I hear they are looking for bodies
at the onion fields.


102
00:10:54.300 --> 00:10:56.268
I found the same thing in Hanford.

103
00:10:56.900 --> 00:10:58.629
The workers are scared.

104
00:10:59.340 --> 00:11:03.709
Then we need to hold twice as many
house meetings than we did in Selma.


105
00:11:13.340 --> 00:11:15.707
- What's the matter?
- It's my back.


106
00:11:19.820 --> 00:11:21.470
You can't take real work anymore.

107
00:11:21.540 --> 00:11:23.622
It hurts even when I don't work.

108
00:11:23.700 --> 00:11:25.623
You should take it easy.

109
00:11:26.100 --> 00:11:29.024
What, and live on just
what Helen makes? No.


110
00:11:29.340 --> 00:11:32.549
We are going to make the kids work
on the weekends now.


111
00:11:37.580 --> 00:11:39.344
but she went and told everybody
at the church,


112
00:11:39.460 --> 00:11:40.825
and now everybody has...

113
00:11:41.340 --> 00:11:42.387
Look who is here.

114
00:11:43.020 --> 00:11:44.624
And very dirty.

115
00:11:45.580 --> 00:11:47.105
Did you walk here from Oxnard?

116
00:11:47.180 --> 00:11:48.227
Ola.

117
00:11:48.300 --> 00:11:49.901
I thought maybe you weren't coming back.

118
00:11:50.300 --> 00:11:52.302
- It's only been two weeks.
- It's been 18 days.


119
00:11:52.380 --> 00:11:53.381
Eighteen days...

120
00:11:54.180 --> 00:11:55.181
Cesar.

121
00:11:56.340 --> 00:11:57.387
Dolores!

122
00:11:59.100 --> 00:12:02.468
Look at you.
You definitely got your hands dirty.


123
00:12:03.060 --> 00:12:05.381
This is Angela. Say, "Hi, Cesar."

124
00:12:05.460 --> 00:12:06.791
Hey, mamita.

125
00:12:07.100 --> 00:12:08.101
I'm gonna put her to bed.

126
00:12:08.180 --> 00:12:09.989
How long are you guys visiting us?

127
00:12:10.060 --> 00:12:12.984
Oh, well, word is you can't
do this without me, so...


128
00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:15.341
You are staying?

129
00:12:15.460 --> 00:12:19.306
Well, of course. You think I'm going to
let you mess up what you've started here?


130
00:12:19.380 --> 00:12:23.066
But before you do anything,
you need to go talk to Fernando.


131
00:12:26.580 --> 00:12:28.264
I need to go talk to Fernando?

132
00:12:29.660 --> 00:12:30.707
Okay.

133
00:12:52.940 --> 00:12:54.066
Hi, Poli.

134
00:12:58.460 --> 00:13:00.144
What happened to your eye?

135
00:13:00.540 --> 00:13:01.746
Nothing.

136
00:13:05.260 --> 00:13:07.547
You wanna talk about this nothing?

137
00:13:07.620 --> 00:13:08.746
Nope.

138
00:13:13.580 --> 00:13:15.628
The kids here are idiots.

139
00:13:17.380 --> 00:13:19.269
They hate us, you know?

140
00:13:21.100 --> 00:13:23.865
<i>They came up on me and Chats,
a bunch of them.</i>


141
00:13:25.260 --> 00:13:27.740
They wouldn't stop calling us "beaners."

142
00:13:27.860 --> 00:13:31.069
Beaners? Is that the best they got?

143
00:13:33.620 --> 00:13:35.748
I've been called much worse.

144
00:13:38.780 --> 00:13:40.270
<i>â€œGreaser,</i>

145
00:13:41.860 --> 00:13:42.861
"wetback,

146
00:13:44.700 --> 00:13:45.906
"spic."

147
00:13:46.180 --> 00:13:48.547
That one doesn't even make sense.

148
00:13:49.220 --> 00:13:50.221
"Brown nigger."

149
00:13:51.100 --> 00:13:52.829
I never heard that one.

150
00:13:52.900 --> 00:13:53.981
Uh-huh.

151
00:13:54.060 --> 00:13:55.744
I learned a lot in the Navy.

152
00:13:58.300 --> 00:14:00.143
Here, put this on your eye.

153
00:14:04.020 --> 00:14:05.590
Who started it?

154
00:14:06.380 --> 00:14:08.269
I told you, they started calling us names.

155
00:14:08.620 --> 00:14:09.985
No, who started the fight?

156
00:14:12.460 --> 00:14:13.507
We didn't have a choice.

157
00:14:14.420 --> 00:14:16.422
You always have a choice.

158
00:14:20.900 --> 00:14:22.982
I knew you wouldn't get it.

159
00:14:39.860 --> 00:14:41.942
<i>although the
official military word is that</i>


160
00:14:42.020 --> 00:14:44.068
<i>these are only mopping up operations,</i>

161
00:14:44.180 --> 00:14:45.944
<i>in five separate actions...</i>

162
00:14:46.020 --> 00:14:48.307
We need to bring the
people together, like a convention.


163
00:14:48.380 --> 00:14:50.382
We need to get
everybody together in one place


164
00:14:50.500 --> 00:14:52.184
so they can see how strong we are.

165
00:14:52.260 --> 00:14:54.228
We should start a credit union.

166
00:14:54.340 --> 00:14:55.865
To loan people money?

167
00:14:55.940 --> 00:14:58.621
It'll give us credibility
and it will help people during the winter.


168
00:14:59.340 --> 00:15:01.866
<i>Hey, remember me? 
Eli Ordonez.</i>

169
00:15:02.340 --> 00:15:04.547
I saw you in Salinas at that other meeting
you were doing.


170
00:15:04.620 --> 00:15:06.702
If you want, I
can help pass those around.

171
00:15:07.100 --> 00:15:09.546
I have a cousin who has no papers.

172
00:15:09.660 --> 00:15:11.389
You tell your cousin,
if he works in the fields,


173
00:15:11.460 --> 00:15:13.508
he has the right to representation.

174
00:15:15.860 --> 00:15:17.703
What is happening here in Delano

175
00:15:18.020 --> 00:15:20.546
is the same thing that is happening
in Salinas or in Stockton.


176
00:15:21.340 --> 00:15:24.184
If we don't get organized,
the bosses are going to treat us like...


177
00:15:24.260 --> 00:15:25.591
Excuse me.

178
00:15:26.220 --> 00:15:27.426
Who are you?

179
00:15:28.660 --> 00:15:29.741
Cesar Chavez.

180
00:15:37.700 --> 00:15:38.940
How much are you
asking for, Chucho?


181
00:15:39.300 --> 00:15:40.586
Twenty-five dollars.

182
00:15:41.380 --> 00:15:42.506
How about 10, Chucho?

183
00:15:42.580 --> 00:15:44.821
Look at all these other people
who also want money.


184
00:15:46.460 --> 00:15:47.900
My daughter has some questionnaires.

185
00:15:48.100 --> 00:15:50.182
We want to know what concerns you.

186
00:15:50.380 --> 00:15:51.711
Come on, just do that for us.

187
00:16:01.900 --> 00:16:06.701
Here, people can put messages
to their family, or anyone, it's free.


188
00:16:08.900 --> 00:16:10.823
Want to see the union paper?

189
00:16:42.060 --> 00:16:43.425
Sheriff, every night this goes on.

190
00:16:43.500 --> 00:16:45.180
And I have to tell
my husband to rush home

191
00:16:45.220 --> 00:16:47.188
because I'm frightened
about what is going on over there.


192
00:16:47.260 --> 00:16:48.910
We are decent folk
and don't want any trouble.


193
00:16:48.980 --> 00:16:51.631
I'm terrified for my children
and who knows where...


194
00:16:51.700 --> 00:16:54.704
Okay... Okay... Ladies... Ladies...
Let me make sure I understand this.


195
00:16:54.780 --> 00:16:57.101
- You say they get together every night?
- Every night.


196
00:16:57.180 --> 00:16:58.181
And there is 50 of them?

197
00:16:58.260 --> 00:17:00.740
Fifty-seven. I count 57.

198
00:17:01.620 --> 00:17:02.746
Fifty-seven?

199
00:17:12.180 --> 00:17:13.341
Mr. Chavez?

200
00:17:15.020 --> 00:17:16.146
Yes?

201
00:17:16.220 --> 00:17:17.460
How are you doin' today?

202
00:17:17.540 --> 00:17:19.861
Fine. How can I help you?

203
00:17:20.220 --> 00:17:21.710
I just wanted to introduce myself.

204
00:17:21.820 --> 00:17:23.300
- I'm Sheriff...
- I know who you are.


205
00:17:26.380 --> 00:17:29.031
You seem to be gathering quite a crowd.

206
00:17:29.820 --> 00:17:30.941
Is there a law against that?

207
00:17:31.460 --> 00:17:33.861
No, not really.

208
00:17:34.900 --> 00:17:37.744
But I would like
to ask you some questions

209
00:17:38.220 --> 00:17:41.667
about some of the people around you
and their affiliations.


210
00:17:41.940 --> 00:17:43.101
Affiliations to what?

211
00:17:43.900 --> 00:17:45.709
Let's say the communist party.

212
00:17:46.220 --> 00:17:47.824
- Communists?
- Yes.


213
00:17:53.540 --> 00:17:55.269
Do you mind tellin' me what's so funny?

214
00:17:56.580 --> 00:17:58.389
It's that we are Catholic.

215
00:17:58.980 --> 00:18:00.391
How can Catholics be communists?

216
00:18:02.420 --> 00:18:04.229
I've seen stranger things.

217
00:18:04.460 --> 00:18:07.191
Mr. Chavez, do you mind
if we take a look around?


218
00:18:08.500 --> 00:18:09.661
Do you have a warrant?

219
00:18:14.260 --> 00:18:15.341
Not on me.

220
00:18:16.380 --> 00:18:17.745
So you're asking me for a favor?

221
00:18:18.340 --> 00:18:19.941
I think you'd be doing yourself a favor.

222
00:18:21.180 --> 00:18:23.751
Come on. There's nothing to see here.

223
00:18:24.900 --> 00:18:26.106
Come in.

224
00:18:27.380 --> 00:18:28.870
We have nothing to hide.

225
00:18:29.020 --> 00:18:31.421
So what they doin' here?

226
00:18:32.220 --> 00:18:33.900
You givin' away free pinatas or something?

227
00:18:34.820 --> 00:18:36.026
It's a credit union.

228
00:18:37.900 --> 00:18:38.981
No shit.

229
00:18:39.260 --> 00:18:40.466
Where's the money coming from?

230
00:18:40.540 --> 00:18:41.826
Donations.

231
00:18:46.020 --> 00:18:47.465
Here's a box if you're interested.

232
00:18:58.860 --> 00:19:01.704
I don't know exactly
what you're up to here

233
00:19:02.220 --> 00:19:04.222
but the citizens of Delano,

234
00:19:04.580 --> 00:19:06.867
they don't care much for subversives.

235
00:19:08.060 --> 00:19:09.869
They respect the law.

236
00:19:11.540 --> 00:19:12.826
So do we.

237
00:19:14.180 --> 00:19:16.421
Especially the Bill of Rights.

238
00:19:17.940 --> 00:19:19.829
Ever read the Bill of Rights?

239
00:19:30.060 --> 00:19:31.300
Let's go.

240
00:19:41.900 --> 00:19:43.940
<i>Listen up, all of you in there.</i>

241
00:19:43.980 --> 00:19:46.221
<i>You have 10 minutes
to vacate the premises.</i>


242
00:19:46.820 --> 00:19:51.382
<i>You are now trespassing and will be
prosecuted to the full extent of the law.</i>


243
00:19:51.460 --> 00:19:52.700
We are not moving!

244
00:19:54.220 --> 00:19:55.267
<i>Is that you, Larry?</i>

245
00:19:56.180 --> 00:19:58.148
Yeah. Yeah, it's me.

246
00:19:58.420 --> 00:20:01.469
<i>Larry, you get your people out of there now
and get back to work.</i>


247
00:20:01.740 --> 00:20:05.461
<i>I'll forget everything.
No blacklisting, no nothing.</i>


248
00:20:07.660 --> 00:20:10.140
Sorry, that's not good enough.

249
00:20:10.940 --> 00:20:12.988
You cut our wages too goddamn much.

250
00:20:13.060 --> 00:20:15.427
We starve on what you pay us anyhow.

251
00:20:16.460 --> 00:20:17.507
Go.

252
00:20:31.060 --> 00:20:32.141
Nobody leave!

253
00:20:34.020 --> 00:20:35.863
Stay together, stay strong!

254
00:20:36.820 --> 00:20:38.709
The growers cut their pay in half.

255
00:20:38.820 --> 00:20:41.107
Now they have barricaded themselves
in the camps.


256
00:20:41.180 --> 00:20:42.181
This thing is blowing up.

257
00:20:42.260 --> 00:20:43.830
- The Filipinos?
- Yeah.


258
00:20:43.900 --> 00:20:46.790
And now the growers are recruiting
our people to break the strikes.


259
00:20:47.460 --> 00:20:50.225
That's why Larry specifically asked
for you, Cesar.


260
00:20:50.540 --> 00:20:51.861
He knows he can't win without us.

261
00:20:52.500 --> 00:20:53.740
Oh, and by the way,

262
00:20:53.820 --> 00:20:56.391
who gives a shit about the Filipinos?

263
00:20:57.100 --> 00:21:00.786
No mames.
They undercut us left and right.


264
00:21:01.740 --> 00:21:03.629
Do you think they would strike for us?

265
00:21:03.700 --> 00:21:06.670
They play the races against each other,
that is their tactic.


266
00:21:08.300 --> 00:21:09.950
Are we a union or not?

267
00:21:27.220 --> 00:21:30.144
Our brother Cesar Chavez
will speak to us now.


268
00:21:35.620 --> 00:21:36.860
Brothers and sisters.

269
00:21:37.980 --> 00:21:42.463
Today our fellow Filipino workers
have taken a vital step


270
00:21:42.780 --> 00:21:46.148
towards the fight for freedom and dignity

271
00:21:46.700 --> 00:21:48.782
that poverty has denied us.

272
00:21:49.620 --> 00:21:55.946
And they have come to us
and asked a very important question.


273
00:21:56.420 --> 00:22:02.348
Whether we're prepared to set our
differences apart and join their strike.


274
00:22:07.820 --> 00:22:10.221
But the most important thing to consider

275
00:22:10.340 --> 00:22:14.823
is if news of this strike remains only in
Delano, then we will have been defeated.


276
00:22:15.580 --> 00:22:21.622
Because they not only own the land,
but also the police and judges.


277
00:22:22.540 --> 00:22:28.741
If we show the world
their abuse, greed, and brutality


278
00:22:29.140 --> 00:22:33.225
then our voice will be heard
and responded to.


279
00:22:34.460 --> 00:22:38.260
And when they see
that our actions are just

280
00:22:38.340 --> 00:22:42.186
they will understand
that our cause is just.


281
00:22:42.660 --> 00:22:46.665
Then we will prevail.
Yes we can!


282
00:22:52.340 --> 00:22:54.741
Strike! I

283
00:23:21.500 --> 00:23:22.626
The growers are going to be...

284
00:23:22.700 --> 00:23:24.748
Larry, now that we are together,
the growers are gonna have to...


285
00:23:24.820 --> 00:23:26.788
I'm not worried about them.

286
00:23:26.860 --> 00:23:28.669
My people are angry.

287
00:23:29.620 --> 00:23:31.668
This thing has been building for too long,
it's ready to explode.


288
00:23:31.820 --> 00:23:33.982
Everyone is angry, we just have
to manage our own people.


289
00:23:34.060 --> 00:23:36.870
I have people from Stockton to Coachella!

290
00:23:36.940 --> 00:23:37.987
I didn't say it
was going to be easy,

291
00:23:38.060 --> 00:23:40.631
but if you take care of your side,
I take care of mine, we'll be fine.


292
00:23:40.780 --> 00:23:43.989
- There are things we can't control.
- No, there are things we have to control.


293
00:23:52.620 --> 00:23:55.829
So who the hell is this Cesar Chavez?

294
00:23:58.660 --> 00:24:00.105
Nobody knows.

295
00:24:01.740 --> 00:24:03.583
Somebody said he was from Arizona.

296
00:24:03.660 --> 00:24:07.551
Word is he used to hang around Alinsky
and the other commies from the CSO.


297
00:24:07.620 --> 00:24:10.829
He's been up and down the valley,
stirring up trouble.


298
00:24:10.900 --> 00:24:12.470
I heard he's Mexican.

299
00:24:16.100 --> 00:24:18.944
Seems a safe bet.

300
00:24:19.420 --> 00:24:22.947
They've come out with this newspaper.

301
00:24:27.180 --> 00:24:29.831
Got this beaner character in there
named Don Sotaco.


302
00:24:32.700 --> 00:24:33.701
There he is.

303
00:24:35.780 --> 00:24:37.384
He's kinda funny.

304
00:24:38.940 --> 00:24:41.625
Well, it's a cartoon,
but I'm not sure it's funny.


305
00:24:42.820 --> 00:24:45.107
Who cares, most of our workers
are illiterate.


306
00:24:45.620 --> 00:24:49.306
Yeah, but you can understand a cartoon
without being able to read.


307
00:24:50.780 --> 00:24:52.464
So, this Don Sotaco,

308
00:24:53.820 --> 00:24:58.986
he, uh, informs the workers
about their rights.


309
00:25:01.620 --> 00:25:04.146
- And this is what, a weekly?
- Mmm-hmm.


310
00:25:06.340 --> 00:25:07.990
Thank God it isn't a daily.

311
00:25:08.060 --> 00:25:15.023
Although, 52 weeks a year,
that is a lot of rights, Sheriff.


312
00:25:15.100 --> 00:25:17.626
Long live the strike!

313
00:25:18.140 --> 00:25:20.586
Long live the farmworker!

314
00:25:21.500 --> 00:25:23.502
Long live our cause!

315
00:25:24.900 --> 00:25:27.187
Long live our farmworker movement!

316
00:25:27.580 --> 00:25:28.820
Did they confirm?

317
00:25:29.180 --> 00:25:30.306
- Of course.
- Anyone...


318
00:25:30.380 --> 00:25:33.702
Mostly local, but some are actually
coming down from San Francisco, Arizona...


319
00:25:33.860 --> 00:25:36.340
- Where are they?
- I don't know. They should be here by now.


320
00:25:38.340 --> 00:25:40.627
Get the hell off our property!

321
00:25:40.700 --> 00:25:41.826
Go back to Mexico!

322
00:25:41.900 --> 00:25:44.949
Stay calm, don't react.

323
00:25:45.020 --> 00:25:47.022
We don't need you. Wetbacks.

324
00:25:47.100 --> 00:25:48.750
- Get out of here!
- Don't react, just keep moving.


325
00:25:48.860 --> 00:25:50.430
We don't need you.
We want you out of our country.


326
00:25:50.500 --> 00:25:53.470
We want you back to Mexico.
Get the hell out of our country!


327
00:25:53.580 --> 00:25:55.548
What do you think
you are looking at, huh?

328
00:25:55.700 --> 00:25:59.261
Damn spics! We don't need you! Get out!

329
00:25:59.820 --> 00:26:03.461
Keep marching. 
Keep marching, please.

330
00:26:03.620 --> 00:26:06.226
- Get these sons of bitches off my land.
- Yes, sir.


331
00:26:06.300 --> 00:26:08.348
We aren't going anywhere,
we have the right to be here.


332
00:26:08.420 --> 00:26:09.421
Suit yourself.

333
00:26:10.020 --> 00:26:14.423
Deputies, now, you're witnesses.
This horde invaded my property


334
00:26:14.540 --> 00:26:17.589
and we are just defending ourselves.

335
00:26:18.300 --> 00:26:20.541
A man has a
duty to defend his property.

336
00:26:20.620 --> 00:26:22.190
You are damn right he does.

337
00:26:22.260 --> 00:26:24.228
Cesar, they will shoot.

338
00:26:24.420 --> 00:26:25.581
You get rid of them!

339
00:26:27.260 --> 00:26:28.750
Everybody move! Move back!

340
00:26:28.940 --> 00:26:30.988
Back to the main road,
everybody move back now!


341
00:26:33.220 --> 00:26:34.949
Move back! Move back! No, no, no!

342
00:26:38.300 --> 00:26:39.506
Are you going to do something?

343
00:26:42.780 --> 00:26:46.068
You hard of hearing?
The boss told you to clear out.


344
00:26:49.140 --> 00:26:50.790
He's not my boss.

345
00:26:50.900 --> 00:26:52.823
And our tax dollars pay
for this public road.


346
00:26:52.900 --> 00:26:54.106
Tax dollars?

347
00:26:54.580 --> 00:26:56.070
There's your tax dollars.

348
00:26:58.620 --> 00:27:00.429
Hey, Gilbert!

349
00:27:12.780 --> 00:27:18.423
Hey, that's enough now. Come on, that's
all. Let's go. Get on over here.


350
00:27:18.540 --> 00:27:21.510
Hello, you are late.

351
00:27:24.380 --> 00:27:26.181
<i>Farm workers
in Delano, California</i>


352
00:27:26.220 --> 00:27:28.029
<i>have begun an unprecedented strike</i>

353
00:27:28.100 --> 00:27:29.147
<i>in the central valley.</i>

354
00:27:29.620 --> 00:27:31.782
<i>Filipino and Mexican workers
have joined forces</i>


355
00:27:31.940 --> 00:27:35.501
<i>to demand fair wages and better working
conditions for their members.</i>


356
00:27:35.660 --> 00:27:39.062
<i>Would you say that most of
your workers are making a decent living?</i>


357
00:27:39.180 --> 00:27:42.662
<i>All I can say is that the men
have to be their judges of their own,</i>


358
00:27:42.780 --> 00:27:45.704
<i>what they want,
because they have chosen this way of life</i>


359
00:27:45.780 --> 00:27:47.908
<i>and, if they were not happy,
they wouldn't be here.</i>


360
00:27:48.020 --> 00:27:50.830
<i>How much have you been getting
for a day's work?</i>


361
00:27:50.980 --> 00:27:52.505
<i>Only two dollars.</i>

362
00:27:52.980 --> 00:27:54.505
<i>- Two dollars a day?
- Yes.</i>


363
00:27:57.060 --> 00:28:00.667
- Are you sure it's not broken?
- I'm sure.


364
00:28:07.500 --> 00:28:08.865
Dad?

365
00:28:08.980 --> 00:28:12.382
It's okay, Fernando.
Go back to sleep, please.


366
00:28:16.900 --> 00:28:20.063
I said go back to sleep, Fernando,
you have school tomorrow.


367
00:28:29.180 --> 00:28:32.662
Here. Put it on.

368
00:28:46.020 --> 00:28:47.943
Does this help?

369
00:28:52.860 --> 00:28:56.103
I told you five minutes ago
to sit down at the table.


370
00:28:58.580 --> 00:28:59.741
Mmm.

371
00:29:00.900 --> 00:29:04.791
To all the growers, their lawyers
and this garbage injunction.


372
00:29:07.220 --> 00:29:09.905
At least they finally got Fred
to come down here.


373
00:29:10.100 --> 00:29:12.910
This court ruling bans all mass picketing.

374
00:29:13.420 --> 00:29:15.070
Mmm. And the best part,

375
00:29:15.140 --> 00:29:18.622
they got a ban on saying
the word "Huelga" anywhere near the fields.


376
00:29:18.740 --> 00:29:19.821
- "Huelga f?"
<i>- "Huelga-"</i>


377
00:29:19.980 --> 00:29:21.744
Can you say "Strike"?

378
00:29:21.900 --> 00:29:23.550
As long as you don't translate it.

379
00:29:23.620 --> 00:29:26.191
You would think a bunch of lawyers
would have heard of the First Amendment.


380
00:29:26.260 --> 00:29:28.308
It's a joke.
They'll get it thrown out on appeal.


381
00:29:28.420 --> 00:29:30.548
Yeah, by the time the state court
hears the appeals,


382
00:29:30.620 --> 00:29:32.782
the grapes will be picked,
the growers know that.


383
00:29:32.900 --> 00:29:35.062
There's only one thing we can do.

384
00:29:35.140 --> 00:29:37.711
We have to get people
to violate the injunction,


385
00:29:37.780 --> 00:29:39.060
and make the Sheriff enforce it.

386
00:29:39.500 --> 00:29:40.786
You mean get arrested.

387
00:29:40.900 --> 00:29:42.823
Make them arrest us
and fill up the jails?

388
00:29:42.900 --> 00:29:46.029
And give the white press
exactly what they want? Hmm?


389
00:29:46.100 --> 00:29:47.625
Rowdy Mexicans in jail.

390
00:29:47.740 --> 00:29:50.186
Have you had your head in the dirt
this whole time?


391
00:29:50.260 --> 00:29:51.625
Things are changing.

392
00:29:51.740 --> 00:29:53.469
Okay, but who is gonna go?

393
00:29:54.300 --> 00:29:55.461
I'll do it.

394
00:29:55.580 --> 00:29:56.901
Once they get you in their jails,

395
00:29:56.940 --> 00:30:00.103
they can figure out ways of keeping
you there a long time, Cesar.


396
00:30:02.620 --> 00:30:03.667
So I'll do it.

397
00:30:04.300 --> 00:30:05.506
Do what?

398
00:30:07.500 --> 00:30:09.150
I'll get arrested.

399
00:30:10.540 --> 00:30:12.110
You can't get arrested.

400
00:30:12.940 --> 00:30:14.146
What? Why not?

401
00:30:14.340 --> 00:30:16.308
Well, who is going to
take care of the kids?


402
00:30:16.380 --> 00:30:17.950
The kids are fine.

403
00:30:18.100 --> 00:30:20.546
- They are big, they take care of themselves.
- No.


404
00:30:23.460 --> 00:30:25.144
Cesar, you are the one who says
we can't ask our members


405
00:30:25.220 --> 00:30:26.790
to do things we are not willing
to do ourselves.


406
00:30:26.860 --> 00:30:28.544
I said no.

407
00:30:33.660 --> 00:30:36.391
Dolores, what do you think?

408
00:30:37.620 --> 00:30:39.190
I think it's a good idea.

409
00:30:41.300 --> 00:30:43.507
I think it's a good idea, too.

410
00:30:44.180 --> 00:30:45.545
Come, let's eat.

411
00:30:46.220 --> 00:30:49.224
You know how it works,
they don't understand.


412
00:30:49.460 --> 00:30:50.746
Strike!

413
00:30:51.300 --> 00:30:52.825
Strike!

414
00:30:53.980 --> 00:30:55.664
Mrs. Chavez,

415
00:30:56.900 --> 00:31:00.507
we have a court order that forbids you
from saying the word "Huelga. <i>"</i>


416
00:31:00.820 --> 00:31:02.231
Strike!

417
00:31:03.980 --> 00:31:06.506
This is your first warning, Mrs. Chavez.

418
00:31:07.900 --> 00:31:09.709
This is your second!

419
00:31:39.060 --> 00:31:40.740
- Good morning to you.
- Good morning, sir.


420
00:31:40.780 --> 00:31:42.270
- Good morning, Grace.
- Good morning.


421
00:31:42.380 --> 00:31:44.542
Call my wife and tell her
I'm not going to be able to make lunch.


422
00:31:44.700 --> 00:31:46.384
Come on, let's go.

423
00:31:46.780 --> 00:31:50.546
I need you to take the trucks across
the border into Mexico,


424
00:31:50.620 --> 00:31:52.461
and I want y'all to bring me back
some illegals


425
00:31:52.540 --> 00:31:54.702
who are willing to work
for an honest day's pay.


426
00:31:54.780 --> 00:31:57.750
And I want you to bring them back here
by the truckload, you hear me.


427
00:31:58.140 --> 00:32:00.905
'Cause we are gonna break
this goddamn strike.


428
00:32:01.820 --> 00:32:03.424
You'll see what these sons of bitches do

429
00:32:03.540 --> 00:32:05.900
when they see their cousins
out there working on 'em fields.


430
00:32:17.020 --> 00:32:20.024
Everyone gather up.

431
00:32:28.300 --> 00:32:30.621
Who's thirsty?

432
00:32:32.380 --> 00:32:34.747
Here, have some cold water.

433
00:32:35.380 --> 00:32:36.620
It's free...

434
00:32:38.420 --> 00:32:42.664
I've been told that some union members

435
00:32:43.100 --> 00:32:46.991
affiliated with the communist party

436
00:32:48.860 --> 00:32:52.103
have been talking with you.

437
00:32:53.220 --> 00:32:57.623
Making promises.
These promises are nothing but lies.


438
00:32:57.700 --> 00:33:00.988
You could even end up in jail.

439
00:33:03.940 --> 00:33:05.669
And for what?

440
00:33:07.260 --> 00:33:09.388
What's wrong, Cruz?

441
00:33:10.180 --> 00:33:11.830
Aren't you thirsty?

442
00:33:13.740 --> 00:33:18.189
If any of you has a problem,
tell me about it.


443
00:33:19.260 --> 00:33:22.469
We don't want any problems here.

444
00:33:26.660 --> 00:33:29.664
- Jail was amazing?
- Yeah, it was.


445
00:33:29.740 --> 00:33:32.550
I got to meet so many amazing people.

446
00:33:32.620 --> 00:33:34.065
There was this woman, Irene,

447
00:33:34.140 --> 00:33:37.861
she was so smart, and I'm gonna
put her on the Credit Union.


448
00:33:38.540 --> 00:33:41.066
And also there was this man
who was laying next to me.


449
00:33:41.140 --> 00:33:42.551
Laying next to you?

450
00:33:42.660 --> 00:33:45.391
Yeah, I saw when he got arrested.

451
00:33:45.500 --> 00:33:48.231
The cops were beating him,
and they were calling him names,


452
00:33:48.340 --> 00:33:51.264
and they were trying to get him
to fight back and he wouldn't.


453
00:33:52.540 --> 00:33:54.383
Do you plan on seeing him again?

454
00:33:56.020 --> 00:33:57.385
Cesar, I don't know what
you are talking about.


455
00:33:57.500 --> 00:33:59.901
Well, you know what? Maybe we can
make him part of the team, you know?


456
00:34:00.020 --> 00:34:01.670
We are always looking for good men.
I mean amazing.


457
00:34:01.740 --> 00:34:03.265
'Cause it was amazing, right?

458
00:34:03.340 --> 00:34:05.820
- Cesar, don't be jealous.
- No.


459
00:34:05.900 --> 00:34:07.390
I'm not jealous.

460
00:34:07.500 --> 00:34:10.549
I'm just glad that you had
such a good time in jail.


461
00:34:14.540 --> 00:34:16.190
Cesar!

462
00:34:16.420 --> 00:34:21.870
Cesar! Hey, Cesar!
It's Jerry Cohen, remember me?


463
00:34:23.580 --> 00:34:25.742
- Who's that?
- He's a lawyer.


464
00:34:25.860 --> 00:34:27.066
You know that man?

465
00:34:27.220 --> 00:34:29.029
How much do you know about
what we are doing?


466
00:34:29.100 --> 00:34:31.626
I've been analyzing your strategy,
and one thing is clear,


467
00:34:31.700 --> 00:34:32.986
you have to stop these injunctions.

468
00:34:33.100 --> 00:34:36.263
I mean they are a catch-22,
the bail alone is going to bankrupt you.


469
00:34:36.340 --> 00:34:38.263
With all due respect,
I know you went to a fancy school,


470
00:34:38.340 --> 00:34:39.421
that doesn't make you an expert.

471
00:34:39.500 --> 00:34:41.980
Well, I also worked the California Rural
Legal Assistance.


472
00:34:42.060 --> 00:34:43.425
- For how long?
- Two years.


473
00:34:43.540 --> 00:34:46.066
Two years, huh? 
Why did you leave?

474
00:34:47.420 --> 00:34:48.501
Um...

475
00:34:48.580 --> 00:34:50.344
It's complicated.

476
00:34:50.420 --> 00:34:51.546
That's what I heard.

477
00:34:53.420 --> 00:34:54.660
You are hired.

478
00:34:55.900 --> 00:34:57.504
Hired?

479
00:34:57.580 --> 00:34:59.469
I want you full time, starting now.

480
00:34:59.580 --> 00:35:01.423
I thought maybe I'd do some consulting?

481
00:35:01.500 --> 00:35:05.027
No, as of now you are in charge
of the United Farm Workers' legal team.


482
00:35:05.100 --> 00:35:07.580
- Who else is on the team?
- Just you.


483
00:35:08.060 --> 00:35:10.586
Doesn't it take more than one person
to make a team?


484
00:35:10.740 --> 00:35:12.902
Oh, you'll be doing more work
than one person.


485
00:35:14.100 --> 00:35:15.784
Against one of the biggest
law firms in California.


486
00:35:15.900 --> 00:35:18.267
And you'll be getting paid
five dollars a week.


487
00:35:18.340 --> 00:35:19.830
Five dollars a week?

488
00:35:20.940 --> 00:35:23.864
You'll be happy to know that
makes you the highest paid employee.


489
00:35:25.020 --> 00:35:27.261
Also our lowest paid employee.

490
00:35:28.180 --> 00:35:29.944
Everybody makes five dollars a week?

491
00:35:30.340 --> 00:35:33.105
Hey! If you wanna make money,
go work for the growers.


492
00:35:43.620 --> 00:35:45.782
We're here to help.

493
00:35:46.460 --> 00:35:47.905
Don't be afraid.

494
00:35:49.060 --> 00:35:50.789
United we will stand.

495
00:35:50.860 --> 00:35:52.624
They will not defeat us.

496
00:35:52.860 --> 00:35:54.669
United we will stand.

497
00:35:54.780 --> 00:35:56.225
They will not defeat us.

498
00:35:56.380 --> 00:35:58.542
This movement is for you, the people.

499
00:36:00.540 --> 00:36:03.987
They will not defeat us.

500
00:36:05.980 --> 00:36:07.630
Long live the strike!

501
00:36:08.820 --> 00:36:10.629
Long live Cesar Chavez!

502
00:36:11.820 --> 00:36:13.982
Son! Son!

503
00:36:14.060 --> 00:36:17.667
They're not paying you enough!
Come join us!


504
00:36:18.380 --> 00:36:20.860
Join the cause!

505
00:36:21.340 --> 00:36:24.310
Son, they're not paying you enough.

506
00:36:25.060 --> 00:36:26.869
Don't betray your people.

507
00:36:27.340 --> 00:36:29.661
Hey, come join us!

508
00:36:30.260 --> 00:36:31.261
Come!

509
00:36:31.980 --> 00:36:33.425
Don't be afraid!

510
00:36:41.660 --> 00:36:42.707
Come on, come on, come on!

511
00:36:42.820 --> 00:36:44.663
Come!

512
00:36:47.100 --> 00:36:48.181
Get closer!

513
00:36:49.740 --> 00:36:52.107
- Closer together!
- Run, get together!


514
00:36:52.340 --> 00:36:54.502
Move back! Move back!

515
00:37:00.860 --> 00:37:02.783
We are not leaving!

516
00:37:03.620 --> 00:37:05.861
Don't move! Stay together.

517
00:37:20.620 --> 00:37:23.783
Pesticide! Helen!

518
00:37:24.340 --> 00:37:25.341
Helen!

519
00:37:27.980 --> 00:37:30.551
- it burns.
- I know.


520
00:37:32.020 --> 00:37:33.146
I almost got it.

521
00:37:36.060 --> 00:37:38.222
That was really scary, Cesar.

522
00:37:41.620 --> 00:37:43.907
What if something happened to us?

523
00:37:46.220 --> 00:37:48.461
What would happen to the kids?

524
00:37:55.620 --> 00:37:58.510
<i>People are starting to lose hope,
and I don't blame them.</i>


525
00:37:59.180 --> 00:38:02.104
They know the growers have broken
the strike with the illegal workers.


526
00:38:02.740 --> 00:38:05.630
And the sweetheart deal with the teamsters.

527
00:38:05.820 --> 00:38:10.303
We can't ask them to keep going when
they see people working in the fields.


528
00:38:11.300 --> 00:38:13.348
We have to take the next step.

529
00:38:13.620 --> 00:38:14.951
We are too weak.

530
00:38:15.940 --> 00:38:18.420
We have no laws to protect us here.

531
00:38:20.660 --> 00:38:23.470
With the boycott,
there are no laws to stop us.


532
00:38:24.300 --> 00:38:26.143
This is the moment, Cesar.

533
00:38:28.700 --> 00:38:31.021
This is what we came here to do.

534
00:38:34.420 --> 00:38:36.900
We just can't
boycott all the growers.


535
00:38:37.060 --> 00:38:41.668
We need to start small, we need a face,
a brand, that's what we need to focus on.


536
00:38:41.820 --> 00:38:43.504
And that face is Victorre Wines.

537
00:38:53.100 --> 00:38:56.024
<i>CESAR". Dolores Huerta will be recruiting
in the west counties,</i>


538
00:38:56.140 --> 00:38:58.580
<i>and Gilbert Padilla
will be recruiting in the southern cities.</i>


539
00:38:58.620 --> 00:39:00.861
<i>And the rest of the state we will
divide amongst each other.</i>


540
00:39:00.980 --> 00:39:03.824
Anybody that can travel, talk to Richard.

541
00:39:04.500 --> 00:39:06.468
My brother knows how to travel.

542
00:39:07.260 --> 00:39:08.830
To be successful,

543
00:39:08.940 --> 00:39:12.501
we have to have an army of boycotters,
willing to do the hard work.


544
00:39:13.140 --> 00:39:14.983
The bigger the army, the
bigger the success.


545
00:39:15.380 --> 00:39:17.303
You start small, you get wins.

546
00:39:18.380 --> 00:39:19.666
The army will get bigger.

547
00:39:20.980 --> 00:39:23.870
The people to best recruit
are the students.


548
00:39:25.300 --> 00:39:30.022
Civil rights groups, some church groups,
those are the best recruits.


549
00:39:30.140 --> 00:39:32.950
Well, any kind of recruit
is the best kind of recruit for us.


550
00:39:34.220 --> 00:39:37.702
So, we need to hit the streets
with aggressive leafleting.


551
00:39:38.220 --> 00:39:39.984
And make so much noise

552
00:39:40.060 --> 00:39:42.142
that they won't be able to ignore us.

553
00:39:42.300 --> 00:39:48.660
Picket lines, in churches,
entertainment venues, colleges, factories.


554
00:39:48.740 --> 00:39:50.742
Anywhere there's a large number of people.

555
00:39:50.860 --> 00:39:52.146
That's where you need to go.

556
00:39:52.300 --> 00:39:53.984
<i>Once we got their attention,</i>

557
00:39:55.380 --> 00:39:59.146
<i>we need to get on every radio show,
and every television show.</i>


558
00:39:59.260 --> 00:40:01.228
There's no bathrooms in the fields.
There's no minimum wage.


559
00:40:01.340 --> 00:40:03.700
The best thing that you can do,
the way we can put pressure,


560
00:40:04.380 --> 00:40:05.870
is to boycott.

561
00:40:06.580 --> 00:40:08.742
You can help by boycotting Victorre Grapes.

562
00:40:08.860 --> 00:40:09.907
Okay, thank you.

563
00:40:10.100 --> 00:40:12.341
<i>CESAR". And tell them personal stories.</i>

564
00:40:12.540 --> 00:40:16.101
<i>Firsthand, from the people
that have suffered in the fields.</i>


565
00:40:16.420 --> 00:40:19.230
<i>Because we are fighting
for basic human rights.</i>


566
00:40:21.060 --> 00:40:24.189
<i>The attention of national
legislators was focused on Delano</i>


567
00:40:24.260 --> 00:40:27.389
<i>when the Senate Subcommittee
on migrant labor conducted hearings</i>


568
00:40:27.580 --> 00:40:28.620
<i>in the Delano high school.</i>

569
00:40:29.180 --> 00:40:31.387
<i>Headed by New Jersey's Harrison Williams.</i>

570
00:40:31.620 --> 00:40:36.467
<i>It also included California's George
Murphy, and New York's Robert Kennedy.</i>


571
00:40:38.540 --> 00:40:40.304
Senator Kennedy
can be very supportive


572
00:40:40.380 --> 00:40:42.181
if he thinks the cause
can make a difference.


573
00:40:42.260 --> 00:40:45.707
So, when he comes, make sure you
walk with him so they can take pictures.


574
00:40:46.060 --> 00:40:47.107
How are you, sir?

575
00:40:47.860 --> 00:40:48.861
How are you? Thank you.

576
00:40:48.940 --> 00:40:49.941
Hi, how are you?

577
00:40:50.100 --> 00:40:52.706
Senator Kennedy, great to see you again.
I'd like to introduce Cesar Chavez.


578
00:40:52.780 --> 00:40:54.225
- It's a pleasure...
- It's likewise.


579
00:40:54.300 --> 00:40:55.790
Go, go, go.

580
00:40:55.940 --> 00:40:57.101
You were supposed to walk with him.

581
00:40:57.220 --> 00:40:59.541
Hi, John, how are you? 
Good to see you.

582
00:40:59.900 --> 00:41:01.709
Don't believe everything you hear today.

583
00:41:03.980 --> 00:41:06.790
Yeah, it looks like he is not even
talking to them either so...


584
00:41:10.900 --> 00:41:14.621
Do you write down the license
plate numbers of everyone in the city?


585
00:41:15.060 --> 00:41:17.984
I'm glad he came,
but I think it's just for show.


586
00:41:18.580 --> 00:41:19.991
I think you're wrong, Fred.

587
00:41:21.500 --> 00:41:22.661
I hope so.

588
00:41:22.940 --> 00:41:26.183
I also see complaints here
from Mr. Chavez that, uh,


589
00:41:26.940 --> 00:41:29.625
pesticides have been sprayed
on some of his picketers.


590
00:41:29.740 --> 00:41:31.469
I'm aware of no such incidents.

591
00:41:32.660 --> 00:41:35.311
What about shots being fired
in their general direction?


592
00:41:35.460 --> 00:41:38.748
We've looked into every one
of Mr. Chavez's complaints


593
00:41:38.860 --> 00:41:41.591
and haven't found an ounce
of truth to any of it.


594
00:41:43.620 --> 00:41:44.621
Lie.

595
00:41:45.420 --> 00:41:50.824
Is it true that you detained some
picketers as a preventive measure?


596
00:41:51.820 --> 00:41:53.629
Your arrest record seems to confirm it.

597
00:41:53.700 --> 00:41:56.544
If I have reason to believe that
there's going to be a riot started,


598
00:41:56.700 --> 00:42:00.500
and someone tells me there's going
to be trouble unless I stop them,


599
00:42:00.660 --> 00:42:02.503
it's my duty to stop them.

600
00:42:04.380 --> 00:42:05.900
You just go out there and arrest them?

601
00:42:05.940 --> 00:42:07.180
Absolutely.

602
00:42:07.300 --> 00:42:08.780
Who told you they were going to riot?

603
00:42:10.980 --> 00:42:12.186
The foremen.

604
00:42:13.380 --> 00:42:15.030
Right out there in the fields.

605
00:42:15.660 --> 00:42:17.867
The ones we were talking to,
said that if we didn't stop them,


606
00:42:18.020 --> 00:42:19.749
they were going to cut their hearts out.

607
00:42:19.820 --> 00:42:23.222
So, rather than let things get out of hand,
we just removed the cause.


608
00:42:23.340 --> 00:42:26.344
This is the most interesting
concept, I think,


609
00:42:27.140 --> 00:42:31.384
that you suddenly hear talk of
somebody who's gonna get out of order,


610
00:42:31.700 --> 00:42:33.225
perhaps violate the law,

611
00:42:33.660 --> 00:42:37.460
and so you go in and arrest
the intended victim of the crime,


612
00:42:37.540 --> 00:42:39.588
and they haven't done anything wrong.

613
00:42:40.740 --> 00:42:44.711
I want to thank Sheriff Smith
for his services to the citizens of Delano.


614
00:42:49.540 --> 00:42:52.191
We'll now take an hour recess for lunch.

615
00:42:52.260 --> 00:42:55.548
Excuse me, can I suggest...

616
00:42:55.660 --> 00:42:58.789
I would just like to suggest that,
in the interim period of time,


617
00:42:58.860 --> 00:43:00.669
in the luncheon period of time,

618
00:43:00.740 --> 00:43:03.664
that the Sheriff
and the Kern County District Attorney,


619
00:43:03.740 --> 00:43:06.949
read the Constitution
of the United States of America.


620
00:43:11.020 --> 00:43:12.749
I guess I was wrong.

621
00:43:27.740 --> 00:43:29.549
Hey! Fuck you!

622
00:43:30.020 --> 00:43:32.068
We are going to
get you, little beaner.


623
00:43:32.420 --> 00:43:33.706
Wetback!

624
00:43:35.220 --> 00:43:37.222
We are going to kick your ass.

625
00:43:45.260 --> 00:43:47.581
You should talk to
Fernando before you go.


626
00:43:48.020 --> 00:43:49.306
Hmm.

627
00:43:51.820 --> 00:43:53.822
He's having trouble with those kids again.

628
00:43:54.620 --> 00:43:55.746
Where is he?

629
00:43:55.820 --> 00:43:57.106
He's at Richard's.

630
00:43:58.420 --> 00:44:00.627
He's been spending a lot
of time there lately.


631
00:44:01.260 --> 00:44:02.944
Maybe that's not such a good idea.

632
00:44:04.060 --> 00:44:05.949
Maybe you should talk to him.

633
00:44:07.940 --> 00:44:09.942
I'll talk to him when I get back.

634
00:44:10.660 --> 00:44:13.470
Cesar, you know that boy
is as stubborn as you are.


635
00:44:16.660 --> 00:44:19.027
Your clean socks are on the top shelf.

636
00:44:21.980 --> 00:44:23.505
Take all of them.

637
00:44:24.500 --> 00:44:25.661
It's a lot of socks.

638
00:44:26.300 --> 00:44:27.825
It's a long walk.

639
00:44:51.980 --> 00:44:53.106
Cesar.

640
00:44:53.620 --> 00:44:55.463
You got a permit for this march?

641
00:44:55.540 --> 00:44:59.670
It's not a march, Sheriff. It's a
pilgrimage all the way to Sacramento.


642
00:44:59.780 --> 00:45:02.181
And our families are here
just to say goodbye.


643
00:45:03.380 --> 00:45:05.951
Do you hear that?

644
00:45:06.020 --> 00:45:12.744
They don't like working for a day's wage,
but they'll walk over 300 miles for free.


645
00:45:15.700 --> 00:45:18.704
Even pilgrims ain't allowed in the street
without a permit.


646
00:45:19.180 --> 00:45:22.582
Fine, we'll use the sidewalk.
It's open to the public.


647
00:46:02.340 --> 00:46:05.150
If we leave at 10 p.m.,
we can catch them in Modesto.


648
00:46:05.220 --> 00:46:06.460
Yeah, I know Dad.

649
00:46:08.900 --> 00:46:10.504
Fernando, what are you doing?

650
00:46:10.580 --> 00:46:11.701
I'm not going with you guys.

651
00:46:11.740 --> 00:46:14.346
We're going to see your dad
and from there we can go home.


652
00:46:14.420 --> 00:46:15.831
I don't want to see my Dad.

653
00:46:15.900 --> 00:46:17.504
He'll be happy to see you!

654
00:46:17.580 --> 00:46:18.740
He won't even know I'm there.

655
00:46:18.780 --> 00:46:20.782
He only cares about the Union.

656
00:46:23.460 --> 00:46:25.189
Check this out.

657
00:46:25.260 --> 00:46:28.946
Big article about the auto workers
standing down to show solidarity.


658
00:46:29.340 --> 00:46:30.341
Hmm.

659
00:46:30.420 --> 00:46:31.546
Front page?

660
00:46:31.620 --> 00:46:33.987
Page six, but we are moving up.

661
00:46:35.460 --> 00:46:37.622
And those longshore workers
are standing down too.


662
00:46:37.780 --> 00:46:38.906
Rookie!

663
00:46:39.460 --> 00:46:40.791
Mansi!

664
00:46:41.420 --> 00:46:43.422
I saw everybody on the news.

665
00:46:44.940 --> 00:46:48.945
I got tired of just sitting around,
watching a lot of TV, you know.


666
00:46:50.260 --> 00:46:52.262
I got some donations from
a department store.


667
00:46:57.740 --> 00:46:59.310
I am glad you came.

668
00:46:59.900 --> 00:47:01.026
I am glad you came.

669
00:47:02.780 --> 00:47:03.781
Donations.

670
00:47:04.140 --> 00:47:05.141
Boots.

671
00:47:06.460 --> 00:47:07.985
They're brand new.

672
00:47:09.580 --> 00:47:11.628
Yeah, about 150 miles too late.

673
00:47:29.140 --> 00:47:30.983
Boycott Victorre!

674
00:47:31.100 --> 00:47:34.502
<i>I am Chief Executive Officer
of the United Church of Christ.</i>

<i>My name is Rabbi Tannenbaum.

676

<i>We believe the United Farm Workers

677
00:47:41.860 --> 00:47:45.660
<i>the hope and aspirations
of a vast majority of farm workers.</i>


678
00:47:45.820 --> 00:47:50.030
<i>I think every American has a stake to bring
about social change within the system,</i>


679
00:47:50.180 --> 00:47:52.911
<i>because if nonviolent means fail,</i>

680
00:47:53.020 --> 00:47:56.024
<i>this becomes a setback for
the entire democratic process.</i>


681
00:47:57.660 --> 00:48:02.222
In colors, in colors,

682
00:48:02.340 --> 00:48:06.311
are the little birds
that come from outside.


683
00:48:07.020 --> 00:48:10.991
In colors, in colors,

684
00:48:11.060 --> 00:48:15.270
is the rainbow that we see shining.

685
00:48:15.460 --> 00:48:18.304
And that is why I love

686

for as long as it takes to win their strike.</i>


689
00:48:41.660 --> 00:48:44.266
The average farm worker only lives to 49.

690
00:48:44.780 --> 00:48:46.942
They say they won't
give you bathrooms in the fields


691
00:48:47.060 --> 00:48:49.347
because Mexicans don't know
how to use them.


692
00:48:50.420 --> 00:48:53.583
<i>I'm Jackie Stringer.
We just drove down from Portland.</i>

<i>CESAR". That's a long drive.</i>

694
00:48:55.260 --> 00:48:56.989
I've been watching the news.

695
00:48:57.060 --> 00:48:59.745
I saw pictures of the children
working in the fields...


696
00:48:59.900 --> 00:49:01.425
We'd like to help in some way.

697
00:49:01.540 --> 00:49:04.828
Well you can do this, don't buy
any more Victorre products.


698
00:49:04.900 --> 00:49:06.789
No more Victorre wine at dinner.

699
00:49:06.900 --> 00:49:09.790
- And then have your friends do the same.
- I will.


700
00:49:22.420 --> 00:49:23.945
Excuse me, sir, can I help you?

701
00:49:30.420 --> 00:49:33.981
You have to sit on your damn booze,
you hear me?


702
00:49:34.100 --> 00:49:36.546
I don't care if you have
to sit on it for a year.


703
00:49:36.620 --> 00:49:40.750
We need you to stay strong.
We need you to hold the line.


704
00:49:40.820 --> 00:49:42.902
We're all counting on you. All of us.

705
00:49:43.660 --> 00:49:45.071
Excuse us.

706
00:49:47.460 --> 00:49:52.307
Strong? Stay strong?
This boycott is killing us!


707
00:49:52.740 --> 00:49:54.390
Have you seen the headlines
they're getting?


708
00:49:54.460 --> 00:49:56.462
Not just in San Francisco,

709
00:49:56.580 --> 00:50:00.551
but in L.A. and San Diego
and Fresno and Sacramento.


710
00:50:00.620 --> 00:50:02.543
They're pulling our products
all over the damn state!


711
00:50:02.620 --> 00:50:06.750
That's costing us money, real money,
Mr. Bogdanovich.


712
00:50:06.820 --> 00:50:09.824
You wanna come in here and explain that
to our shareholders?


713
00:50:09.940 --> 00:50:13.547
You wanna reimburse us those losses
so our stock price doesn't dip?


714
00:50:17.260 --> 00:50:18.671
Can we sit?

715
00:50:18.860 --> 00:50:23.821
<i>A 340 mile pilgrimage

Cesar!

723
00:50:56.220 --> 00:50:59.190
There's a guy on the phone,
he says he's from Victorre.


724
00:51:00.140 --> 00:51:01.869
And he wants to negotiate.

725
00:51:03.580 --> 00:51:05.025
He's called three times.

726
00:51:09.380 --> 00:51:10.541
Get Jerry up here!

727
00:51:10.860 --> 00:51:12.021
Okay!

728
00:51:12.660 --> 00:51:15.584
Fine, you've got your deal,
but if we're gonna pay top dollar,


729
00:51:15.700 --> 00:51:17.429
we expect top dollar work.

730
00:51:17.580 --> 00:51:22.142
That means no one, and I mean no one, is
gonna cut unripe grapes to pad their lugs.


731
00:51:22.220 --> 00:51:23.551
Or stick them full
of god damn dirt clods.

732
00:51:23.660 --> 00:51:24.707
Objection.

733
00:51:25.260 --> 00:51:27.388
Objection? What do you mean?

734
00:51:27.540 --> 00:51:29.065
Well, it's a personal objection.

735
00:51:29.540 --> 00:51:32.749
You may not be aware but these people
have been doing this for a very long time.


736
00:51:32.860 --> 00:51:34.942
They don't need you to tell them
how to pick a grape.


737
00:51:35.100 --> 00:51:37.671
Well, you tell them that
when they're packing my grapes...


738
00:51:50.300 --> 00:51:53.224
Well that was the most eloquent piss
I've ever heard.


739

I'm standing up for my son.

749
00:52:22.780 --> 00:52:24.509
Because somebody has to.

750
00:52:46.180 --> 00:52:47.511
So what's your plan?

751
00:52:50.140 --> 00:52:52.791
You can't stay at your
grandparents' house forever.


752

Don't act like all of a sudden
you are interested in what I'm doing.


753
00:52:57.140 --> 00:52:58.790
Of course I'm interested.

754
00:53:00.820 --> 00:53:02.345
You're my son.

755
00:53:06.940 --> 00:53:09.341
Don't worry. I'll be fine.

756
00:53:12.380 --> 00:53:14.951

It's going to be fine.

760
00:54:04.860 --> 00:54:07.386
Aren't you going to eat something?

761
00:54:18.100 --> 00:54:20.546
You want some carrots or broccoli
that your grandpa grows?


762
00:54:21.380 --> 00:54:23.030
You still hungry? Carrot?

763
00:54:25.580 --> 00:54:27.184
I just got word.

764
00:54:28.060 --> 00:54:30.108
Chavez is going to target us next.

765
00:54:32.420 --> 00:54:33.945
Zucchini.

766

Dad? What should we do?

767
00:54:40.780 --> 00:54:42.111
I don't know, John.

768
00:54:42.220 --> 00:54:45.508
I'm not the one who went to college.
I'm not the one with the Master's Degree.


769
00:54:45.580 --> 00:54:47.503
I'm only the one
who invested a lot of money


770

in his only son,

771
00:54:50.100 --> 00:54:54.628
hoping that one day, he would be able
to answer one simple question.


772
00:54:56.420 --> 00:55:01.267
How do I not drive my father's business
into the fucking ground?


773
00:55:02.620 --> 00:55:07.786
I'll, um, talk to the Sheriff.

774
00:55:13.460 --> 00:55:14.746
You're a big man.

775
00:55:15.740 --> 00:55:17.583
Broccoli.

776
00:55:18.500 --> 00:55:19.626
Hmm?

777
00:55:23.220 --> 00:55:25.143
It's time for his nap, Sir.

778
00:55:26.660 --> 00:55:28.742
No, no. You can
leave him. He is fine.

779
00:55:32.780 --> 00:55:34.589
Yes, sir.

780
00:55:35.020 --> 00:55:40.982
Maria, you know about this Chavez, no?
Do you really think he's one of you?


781
00:55:44.500 --> 00:55:46.025
Yes, sir.

782
00:55:46.820 --> 00:55:48.106
Hmm.

783
00:55:48.180 --> 00:55:50.148
Well, I'm one of you too.

784
00:55:50.300 --> 00:55:52.621
I came from Croatia with nothing.

785
00:55:52.820 --> 00:55:57.462
Everything I got, I built with my own
hands, my own labor, and my own sweat.


786
00:55:57.540 --> 00:56:01.147
I don't see why anyone should be able
to take that away from me.


787
00:56:02.660 --> 00:56:04.264
So now you want me to help you?

788
00:56:04.340 --> 00:56:05.580
No, no. It's very simple.

789
00:56:05.660 --> 00:56:07.947
I want you to do your job.

790
00:56:08.060 --> 00:56:09.186
Patience.

791
00:56:09.900 --> 00:56:11.504
Is that what you told Victorre?

792
00:56:12.020 --> 00:56:15.024
Because this time we actually
need you to do something.


793
00:56:15.100 --> 00:56:19.662
You see, after the senate hearings,
I can't do nothing about nothing.


794
00:56:19.900 --> 00:56:21.186
Unless they break the law.

795
00:56:21.500 --> 00:56:23.389
Did you hear what I just said?

796
00:56:23.540 --> 00:56:27.864
They are targeting my family now.
Do you understand?


797
00:56:27.940 --> 00:56:30.989
Or do you need my father
to repeat it to you, hmm?


798
00:56:34.980 --> 00:56:36.550
I got too much heat on me.

799
00:56:38.860 --> 00:56:43.343
I can turn a blind eye,
but that's as far as I can go on this.


800
00:56:45.380 --> 00:56:47.030
You do that.

801
00:56:47.620 --> 00:56:49.224
Sit on your ass.

802
00:57:17.580 --> 00:57:19.821
Hey! You okay?

803
00:57:19.900 --> 00:57:21.345
Yes, I'm okay.

804
00:57:21.420 --> 00:57:22.421
Okay, don't move.

805
00:57:25.900 --> 00:57:27.425
Stop it! That's enough!

806
00:57:27.500 --> 00:57:29.821
I said stop! Leave him alone!

807
00:57:29.900 --> 00:57:32.267
You don't want to do this!
You don't wanna hurt this man!


808
00:57:32.340 --> 00:57:33.501
What are you doing, Cesar?

809
00:57:33.580 --> 00:57:35.105
Leave him alone.

810
00:57:35.220 --> 00:57:38.269
This son of a bitch needs to pay
right here, right now.


811
00:57:38.340 --> 00:57:39.341
No, no, no.

812
00:57:39.420 --> 00:57:42.947
The next person who lays a hand on him
is out of the Union!


813
00:57:43.780 --> 00:57:45.111
He's gone!

814
00:57:45.780 --> 00:57:47.020
You don't want to do this!

815
00:57:47.100 --> 00:57:50.388
Not like this!
This is not the way to do things.


816
00:57:51.700 --> 00:57:53.782
Get that piece of shit out of here.

817
00:57:53.940 --> 00:57:54.987
What did you say?

818
00:57:55.060 --> 00:57:57.347
Eli! Come on!

819
00:57:57.460 --> 00:57:59.189
- What?
- Stop it!


820
00:57:59.260 --> 00:58:02.389
I said get that piece of shit
out of here and throw him in the trash.


821
00:58:02.460 --> 00:58:04.940
Do you need
someone to translate that for you?


822
00:58:11.300 --> 00:58:15.385
Stop! You're out of the Union!
You're out of the Union! You hear me?


823
00:58:15.460 --> 00:58:17.986
You are out! Go! Get out!

824
00:58:45.420 --> 00:58:47.468
<i>CESAR". We have completely lost our way.</i>

825
00:58:48.340 --> 00:58:51.423
<i>How can we condemn
police brutalities in the inner cities,</i>


826
00:58:51.500 --> 00:58:53.980
<i>yet advocate violence
out here in the fields?</i>


827
00:58:54.820 --> 00:58:58.950
How can we criticize the carnage
in Vietnam, yet cry for blood here at home?


828
00:58:59.300 --> 00:59:01.348
This isn't about Vietnam,

829
00:59:02.180 --> 00:59:03.466
this is about Delano,

830
00:59:04.460 --> 00:59:06.428
this is about being a man,

831
00:59:07.180 --> 00:59:09.342
this is about enough is enough!

832
00:59:10.500 --> 00:59:12.104
No, no, no.

833
00:59:12.180 --> 00:59:15.343
Those of you running around,
destroying things,


834
00:59:15.980 --> 00:59:17.425
giving into your hatred

835
00:59:17.860 --> 00:59:19.862
and your chicken shit macho ideals

836
00:59:19.940 --> 00:59:22.261
are seriously sabotaging
the efforts of La Causa,


837
00:59:22.380 --> 00:59:23.870
and I will not stand for it!

838
00:59:31.460 --> 00:59:32.621
I failed you.

839
00:59:36.660 --> 00:59:38.662
I failed you as a leader.

840
00:59:40.180 --> 00:59:41.830
And I have something to tell you.

841
00:59:42.540 --> 00:59:44.508
Three days ago I stopped eating.

842
00:59:47.220 --> 00:59:50.622
I will continue to fast until everyone,

843
00:59:50.740 --> 00:59:53.471
and I mean everyone,
in our beautiful movement


844
00:59:54.660 --> 00:59:56.901
makes a pledge recommitting themselves

845
00:59:57.380 --> 00:59:58.711
to nonviolence.

846
00:59:59.820 --> 01:00:03.222
'Cause we move forward together,
or not at all.


847
01:00:09.980 --> 01:00:13.189
So that's your big solution?
Starvin' yourself?


848
01:00:13.260 --> 01:00:15.103
That helps them more than us!

849
01:00:15.180 --> 01:00:16.181
Settle down.

850
01:00:16.260 --> 01:00:18.501
Yes or no? Yes or no?

851
01:00:18.580 --> 01:00:19.741
- Yes!
- No!


852
01:00:19.860 --> 01:00:24.184
Settle down. Come on. Please sit down.
The meeting is not over.


853
01:01:29.020 --> 01:01:30.021
You okay?

854
01:01:33.620 --> 01:01:35.588
I had a bad dream.

855
01:01:36.460 --> 01:01:38.508
Dreamin' about food again?

856
01:01:38.580 --> 01:01:39.820
Mmm-mmm.

857
01:01:40.660 --> 01:01:42.503
No. The ranch...

858
01:01:44.300 --> 01:01:46.951
The horses were screaming.

859
01:01:50.300 --> 01:01:52.302
Like, when the bulldozer came.

860
01:01:53.260 --> 01:01:54.830
I couldn't move my legs

861
01:01:55.700 --> 01:01:57.350
and everyone left me behind.

862
01:02:00.420 --> 01:02:02.866
I haven't thought about that
bulldozer in years.


863
01:02:05.340 --> 01:02:07.024
What I remember most

864
01:02:08.700 --> 01:02:10.384
was that feeling,

865
01:02:11.620 --> 01:02:12.860
that feeling of

866
01:02:13.540 --> 01:02:14.621
impotence.

867
01:02:16.300 --> 01:02:18.541
When that bulldozer knocked over the farm.

868
01:02:19.140 --> 01:02:20.949
Dad couldn't look me in the eye.

869
01:02:22.780 --> 01:02:24.305
That look on his face...

870
01:02:25.220 --> 01:02:27.700
The shame behind his eyes...

871
01:02:29.900 --> 01:02:31.345
It never left him.

872
01:02:33.980 --> 01:02:36.221
It's the first time I
saw the old man cry.

873
01:02:40.820 --> 01:02:42.982
That's what I'm scared of, Rookie.

874
01:02:46.580 --> 01:02:49.504
To go back and face my family,

875
01:02:51.540 --> 01:02:53.861
after everything that
I've put them through,


876
01:02:54.580 --> 01:02:57.231
and tell them that it
was all for nothing...


877
01:03:00.900 --> 01:03:02.390
So this is how you face them?

878
01:03:05.540 --> 01:03:06.541
Mansi, listen,

879
01:03:07.380 --> 01:03:10.827
you know I've been with you.
Through thick and through thin.


880
01:03:12.860 --> 01:03:14.942
But we need a leader not a martyr.

881
01:03:15.940 --> 01:03:17.501
I need to understand what you're doing.

882
01:03:19.100 --> 01:03:20.261
I've lost my way...

883
01:03:20.580 --> 01:03:21.786
We all lost our way.

884
01:03:23.900 --> 01:03:26.187
The violence, the anger...

885
01:03:27.340 --> 01:03:28.785
I'm angry too!

886
01:03:29.260 --> 01:03:30.944
I'm angry that I live in a world

887
01:03:31.060 --> 01:03:33.222
where a man who picks your food
can't feed his family.


888
01:03:35.780 --> 01:03:37.191
I used to think

889
01:03:38.940 --> 01:03:40.271
the fight was with the growers.

890
01:03:43.060 --> 01:03:44.949
It's with ourselves.

891
01:03:47.060 --> 01:03:48.869
We need to stop acting like victims.

892
01:03:51.740 --> 01:03:52.980
I'm not going to stop,

893
01:03:55.220 --> 01:03:57.302
I'm going to see
it all the way through.

894
01:04:01.580 --> 01:04:02.820
Because if we lose...

895
01:04:03.820 --> 01:04:05.982
I won't be able
to look at my family in the eye.


896
01:04:09.140 --> 01:04:10.471
What if you die, Mansi?

897
01:04:11.580 --> 01:04:13.423
Who are we going to look to then?

898
01:04:27.980 --> 01:04:30.028
Get up there, it's a great shot.

899
01:04:35.340 --> 01:04:36.751
<i>If you are
just arriving, please,</i>


900
01:04:36.860 --> 01:04:38.669
<i>head to the registration table to check in</i>

901
01:04:38.780 --> 01:04:40.987
<i>and sign our pledge of non-violence.</i>

902
01:05:21.260 --> 01:05:22.466
Dear brothers and sisters.

903
01:05:22.540 --> 01:05:25.111
As we prepare to celebrate
the mystery of Christ's love,


904
01:05:25.180 --> 01:05:26.750
let us acknowledge our sins.

905
01:05:27.220 --> 01:05:29.222
I confess to almighty God

906
01:05:29.380 --> 01:05:33.305
and to you, my brothers and sisters,
that I have sinned through my own fault


907
01:05:33.380 --> 01:05:36.145
in my thoughts and in my words,
in what I have done and have failed to do.


908
01:05:36.220 --> 01:05:38.905
Through my fault, through my fault
through my most grievous fault.


909
01:06:22.620 --> 01:06:25.305
It's okay. It's okay, Cesar.

910
01:06:35.260 --> 01:06:37.627
<i>There is no
strike in the vineyards.</i>


911
01:06:37.740 --> 01:06:40.710
<i>Our workers have
sought to stay with us,</i>


912
01:06:40.780 --> 01:06:44.307
<i>and continue work without any interest
in this outside organization.</i>


913
01:06:44.380 --> 01:06:45.541
<i>They don't belong here</i>

914
01:06:45.620 --> 01:06:47.987
<i>and I wish they would all go back
to where they came from.</i>


915
01:06:48.300 --> 01:06:51.383
<i>The Chavez group are
seeking to force the growers</i>


916
01:06:51.460 --> 01:06:54.828
<i>to recognize their group
as the bargaining agent.</i>


917
01:06:57.620 --> 01:07:00.510
<i>WOMAN". And they've interfered
with our daily workers.</i>


918
01:07:02.340 --> 01:07:05.662
<i>And the only contracts that
were signed between Mr. Chavez's union</i>


919
01:07:05.780 --> 01:07:09.580
<i>and a few wineries that signed up
under the coercion of his threats...</i>


920
01:07:15.900 --> 01:07:17.501
<i>HELEN". What if something happens to us?</i>

921
01:07:18.500 --> 01:07:19.581
<i>I'm standing up for my son!</i>

922
01:07:19.660 --> 01:07:21.150
<i>What would happen to the kids?</i>

923
01:07:22.340 --> 01:07:23.830
<i>Mr. Chavez!</i>

924
01:07:45.460 --> 01:07:48.942
They've been coming in bigger numbers
ever since Chavez quit eating.


925
01:07:51.100 --> 01:07:52.943
How long can a man go without food?

926
01:07:54.540 --> 01:07:56.224
It depends on the man, John.

927
01:07:57.300 --> 01:07:59.382
Everything depends on the man.

928
01:08:00.700 --> 01:08:04.182
Maybe we let, uh, Chavez
starve himself to death,


929
01:08:05.540 --> 01:08:07.542
then we won't have to do anything.

930
01:08:10.220 --> 01:08:13.463
Unfortunately, I don't think
he is the suicidal type.


931
01:08:19.580 --> 01:08:21.662
Ma! I'm gonna leave
some more stuff here.


932
01:08:21.740 --> 01:08:23.742
Mostly clothes I don't wear anymore.

933
01:08:26.820 --> 01:08:29.551
Mom, what's wrong?

934
01:08:46.060 --> 01:08:48.062
Does he know what he's doing to you?

935
01:08:48.500 --> 01:08:50.104
No. He doesn't.

936
01:08:53.380 --> 01:08:55.701
Please go see your father before you leave.

937
01:09:01.100 --> 01:09:02.590
How is he?

938
01:09:05.100 --> 01:09:06.590
He's not good.

939
01:09:14.460 --> 01:09:16.462
Thank you. My brother appreciates it.

940
01:09:16.540 --> 01:09:18.702
- Hi.
- Hi Cruz, how're you doing?


941
01:09:18.780 --> 01:09:21.750
I brought my cousins to sign the pledge,
they just crossed the border.


942
01:09:21.940 --> 01:09:23.988
Well done, have them sign.

943
01:09:27.500 --> 01:09:28.706
Look.

944
01:09:28.860 --> 01:09:30.908
I brought Cesar some food.

945
01:09:31.140 --> 01:09:34.144
Please tell him to eat something
and stop being stubborn.


946
01:09:59.620 --> 01:10:01.588
- You wanna lie down?
- No.


947
01:10:01.660 --> 01:10:03.180
Come on. I'll fix your pillow for you.

948
01:10:03.340 --> 01:10:06.025
No, no. I'm okay.

949
01:10:09.180 --> 01:10:10.830
I'm going to go home now.

950
01:10:11.580 --> 01:10:13.150
Do you need anything?

951
01:10:14.460 --> 01:10:15.586
Did Fernando come?

952
01:10:18.780 --> 01:10:19.781
No.

953
01:11:11.100 --> 01:11:13.387
And he took bread in his hands

954
01:11:13.700 --> 01:11:14.986
blessed it

955
01:11:16.060 --> 01:11:18.745
and gave it to his disciples and said

956
01:11:19.540 --> 01:11:21.349
"Take this all of you, and eat it"

957
01:11:21.580 --> 01:11:23.821
"this is my body
which will be given up for you."


958
01:11:23.900 --> 01:11:26.301
- The body of Christ.
- Amen.


959
01:11:44.860 --> 01:11:46.066
Amen.

960
01:12:07.100 --> 01:12:09.785
I come as an American citizen

961
01:12:09.900 --> 01:12:12.301
to honor him for what he has done.

962
01:12:12.380 --> 01:12:15.702
Not just for you,
not just for the state.

963
01:12:15.820 --> 01:12:18.824
But for all of the United
States of America.


964
01:12:22.940 --> 01:12:25.227
I come here out of respect

965
01:12:25.300 --> 01:12:28.304
for one of the
heroic figures of our time,

966
01:12:28.980 --> 01:12:30.823
Cesar Chavez!

967
01:12:42.620 --> 01:12:44.907
<i>The consumer
has a tremendous interest</i>


968
01:12:44.980 --> 01:12:47.586
<i>and, I think, should support the
farm worker and support the farmer.</i>


969
01:12:47.660 --> 01:12:50.061
<i>And the farm workers are
in that field, in that ranch,</i>


970
01:12:50.140 --> 01:12:51.790
<i>they're working, they're not on strike.</i>

971
01:12:51.860 --> 01:12:56.946
<i>Meanwhile, Cesar Chavez has
organized his efforts to employ a new tactic,</i>


972
01:12:57.020 --> 01:12:59.148
<i>one that would have a national effect.</i>

973
01:12:59.460 --> 01:13:00.905
<i>One of the biggest facts is that</i>

974
01:13:00.980 --> 01:13:04.826
<i>the American public won't stand
for injustice as long as they know.</i>


975
01:13:05.740 --> 01:13:09.984
<i>And we are fighting for legitimate wages
in a legitimate way.</i>


976
01:13:10.060 --> 01:13:13.462
<i>One of the biggest weapons
we have is the boycott.</i>


977
01:13:13.540 --> 01:13:18.182
<i>Not only is it an economic weapon
but it's also a non-violent weapon.</i>


978
01:13:18.260 --> 01:13:19.500
<i>Picket lines
have been put around...</i>


979
01:13:19.580 --> 01:13:20.581
Prick.

980
01:13:20.660 --> 01:13:22.628
<i>Supermarkets in 23 major cities.</i>

981
01:13:22.700 --> 01:13:25.829
<i>Most supermarkets in the country
still stock grapes.</i>


982
01:13:25.900 --> 01:13:29.143
<i>But a significant number of shoppers,
mostly housewives,</i>


983
01:13:29.220 --> 01:13:30.426
<i>are not buying the grapes.</i>

984
01:13:30.500 --> 01:13:32.582
<i>They are observing the boycott.</i>

985
01:13:32.660 --> 01:13:36.551
<i>That's a report from Delano, California.
This is Charles Walker...</i>


986
01:13:48.100 --> 01:13:52.071
We know that your organization supported
us in the picket lines in Pittsburgh,


987
01:13:52.140 --> 01:13:53.187
and we were wondering if you could

988
01:13:53.260 --> 01:13:56.104
organize another team of people again
this coming week.


989
01:13:56.180 --> 01:13:57.944
What city are you in?

990
01:13:58.020 --> 01:13:59.101
Montreal?

991
01:13:59.180 --> 01:14:01.581
Wisconsin is next, okay?

992
01:14:01.660 --> 01:14:02.946
Okay, I'll tell everyone.

993
01:14:03.580 --> 01:14:04.820
Thank you, bye.

994
01:14:08.140 --> 01:14:10.746
Last report estimates that we've cost them

995
01:14:11.180 --> 01:14:13.581
$17 million to date!

996
01:14:18.300 --> 01:14:20.587
I wish they'd paid that in fair wages.

997
01:14:21.340 --> 01:14:25.061
What is your view
of the strike of the grape industry?


998
01:14:25.140 --> 01:14:26.426
The grape boycott...

999
01:14:26.500 --> 01:14:30.027
Well, I've classified that
in the past in a number of public occasions


1000
01:14:30.100 --> 01:14:32.467
as immoral. I think it is.

1001
01:14:33.540 --> 01:14:35.110
Get me John on the phone!

1002
01:14:35.180 --> 01:14:36.181
Yes, sir.

1003
01:14:45.180 --> 01:14:46.420
Did you see it?

1004
01:14:47.260 --> 01:14:48.830
Man of the year!

1005
01:14:49.180 --> 01:14:50.909
I thought they were going to make
him Pope.


1006
01:14:53.260 --> 01:14:55.911
I know... It's all right.

1007
01:14:57.500 --> 01:14:59.264
Well, let's get together on Sunday.

1008
01:15:04.540 --> 01:15:06.827
I saw her last week.
She told me and I forgot.


1009
01:15:07.980 --> 01:15:10.824
But she looks great. 
She looks great.

1010
01:15:10.900 --> 01:15:11.947
Yes, she does.

1011
01:15:12.020 --> 01:15:13.624
Gentlemen.

1012
01:15:15.020 --> 01:15:16.021
Look,

1013
01:15:17.060 --> 01:15:20.109
I say it's time for the families to
put their differences aside


1014
01:15:20.900 --> 01:15:22.948
and speak together with one voice.

1015
01:15:23.340 --> 01:15:24.341
I agree.

1016
01:15:25.540 --> 01:15:28.589
Let's sit down with these bastards
and settle this thing once and for all.


1017
01:15:34.260 --> 01:15:35.625
Jack, are you serious?

1018
01:15:35.700 --> 01:15:38.067
You want to sit down with these characters?

1019
01:15:39.700 --> 01:15:41.270
We can't hang on much longer.

1020
01:15:41.700 --> 01:15:43.748
This boycott is bleeding us to death.

1021
01:15:44.300 --> 01:15:48.350
If we sit down with them it won't
be a boycott, it will be an insurrection.


1022
01:15:49.580 --> 01:15:50.991
We still gotta negotiate.

1023
01:15:51.060 --> 01:15:54.781
We don't have to negotiate,
we have to dictate terms.


1024
01:15:55.740 --> 01:15:56.741
Look,

1025
01:15:58.100 --> 01:16:00.023
I hate dealing with these dirty foreigners,

1026
01:16:01.100 --> 01:16:03.910
but we can't keep
putting on fake labels forever.


1027
01:16:04.820 --> 01:16:06.709
I'm a dirty foreigner, Jack.

1028
01:16:09.540 --> 01:16:10.587
You know what I mean.

1029
01:16:11.260 --> 01:16:13.388
I'm not the only
one who feels like this.

1030
01:16:14.900 --> 01:16:17.790
You're not? Well, who else feels that way?

1031
01:16:18.860 --> 01:16:20.271
Jack's got a point.

1032
01:16:20.780 --> 01:16:25.422
It's time for us to cut our losses
and negotiate.


1033
01:16:25.940 --> 01:16:27.988
You don't negotiate with children.

1034
01:16:28.060 --> 01:16:31.542
You don't give children
every piece of candy in the store.


1035
01:16:32.260 --> 01:16:36.982
With children, you set the rules
and you make sure they obey them.


1036
01:16:45.140 --> 01:16:46.141
How you been?

1037
01:16:46.740 --> 01:16:49.505
I'm good. I broke 70.

1038
01:16:54.380 --> 01:16:57.021
You know, when the Chinese
came to America to build the rail roads,


1039
01:16:57.140 --> 01:16:58.981
you know what
they demanded of their overseers?


1040
01:17:00.100 --> 01:17:01.101
No.

1041
01:17:01.420 --> 01:17:03.821
Food. Good food.

1042
01:17:05.620 --> 01:17:06.985
And enough time to enjoy it.

1043
01:17:07.980 --> 01:17:10.460
And if the owners skimped on that,
they wouldn't lift a finger.


1044
01:17:11.900 --> 01:17:13.902
Give the Chinese a good meal every day

1045
01:17:13.980 --> 01:17:16.141
and they could
build the infrastructure of a continent.


1046
01:17:17.500 --> 01:17:20.424
Their meal is what gave
their lives dignity.


1047
01:17:21.700 --> 01:17:25.182
And to them, dignity was
more important than money.


1048
01:17:26.220 --> 01:17:28.268
That's nice, huh?

1049
01:17:28.980 --> 01:17:31.711
You have this annoying habit
of turning everything into a lesson.


1050
01:17:33.820 --> 01:17:35.390
I just like Chinese food.

1051
01:17:40.380 --> 01:17:41.461
How you doing?

1052
01:17:43.060 --> 01:17:44.824
I told you. I'm good.

1053
01:17:46.500 --> 01:17:48.070
With golf?

1054
01:17:48.900 --> 01:17:50.106
What's wrong with golf?

1055
01:17:55.500 --> 01:17:57.628
You are becoming a real American.

1056
01:17:59.300 --> 01:18:00.790
Golf is from Scotland.

1057
01:18:08.940 --> 01:18:12.342
<i>We interrupt to bring
you this bulletin from Los Angeles.</i>


1058
01:18:12.420 --> 01:18:15.788
<i>New York Senator Robert Kennedy
has been shot in the head,</i>


1059
01:18:15.860 --> 01:18:18.431
<i>minutes ago as he left the platform</i>

1060
01:18:18.500 --> 01:18:21.549
<i>from which he made his victory statement
in Los Angeles.</i>


1061
01:18:21.620 --> 01:18:24.863
<i>The detailed report
which we did receive initially</i>


1062
01:18:24.980 --> 01:18:28.985
<i>pictured Kennedy
on the floor of the hotel kitchen.</i>


1063
01:18:29.060 --> 01:18:33.110
<i>Blood streaming from his face,
his eyes open but unseeing.</i>


1064
01:18:33.580 --> 01:18:36.390
<i>He is on his way,
or perhaps has already arrived</i>


1065
01:18:36.460 --> 01:18:38.747
<i>at an unnamed hospital in Los Angeles.</i>

1066
01:18:39.700 --> 01:18:44.183
<i>The moment further word is received
we will pass it along to you immediately.</i>


1067
01:18:46.020 --> 01:18:50.150
<i>The final act in the
stunning tragedy of Robert Francis Kennedy</i>


1068
01:18:50.220 --> 01:18:52.222
<i>began this morning
with a touching ceremony</i>


1069
01:18:52.340 --> 01:18:55.549
<i>in St. Patrick's Cathedral
here in New York City.</i>


1070
01:18:55.620 --> 01:18:58.351
<i>The late senator was then
transported to his final resting place,</i>


1071
01:18:58.940 --> 01:19:02.786
<i>near his brother the late President
at Arlington National Cemetery.</i>


1072
01:19:05.220 --> 01:19:08.508
<i>I, Richard Milhous Nixon,
do solemnly swear...</i>


1073
01:19:11.220 --> 01:19:13.507
Everyone, stop working for a minute.

1074
01:19:13.900 --> 01:19:16.983
Come, join the strike.
Cesar Chavez wants to defend you!


1075
01:19:18.500 --> 01:19:22.744
<i>That I will faithfully execute the
office of President of the United States...</i>


1076
01:19:27.380 --> 01:19:29.781
<i>And will to the best of my ability...</i>

1077
01:19:32.300 --> 01:19:34.587
<i>Preserve, protect and defend...</i>

1078
01:19:36.740 --> 01:19:39.584
<i>The Constitution of the United States...</i>

1079
01:19:47.060 --> 01:19:48.789
<i>So help me God.</i>

1080
01:20:25.100 --> 01:20:27.148
Slow down!

1081
01:20:27.620 --> 01:20:30.146
Slow down! Slow down!

1082
01:20:37.460 --> 01:20:40.623
- Call an ambulance!
- Juan! Juan!


1083
01:20:42.060 --> 01:20:43.664
Help! Help!

1084
01:21:12.220 --> 01:21:14.746
<i>We thank you
for all that you are doing for us.</i>


1085
01:21:14.820 --> 01:21:16.584
<i>We very much appreciate it.</i>

1086
01:21:17.460 --> 01:21:18.461
Yes, sir.

1087
01:21:18.540 --> 01:21:20.508
Well, you're someone
who understands business


1088
01:21:20.580 --> 01:21:23.823
and you're a Californian,
we're all Californians here...


1089
01:21:24.340 --> 01:21:25.671
Yes, sir.

1090
01:21:26.380 --> 01:21:28.030
I'll do my best.

1091
01:21:28.100 --> 01:21:30.467
And thank you, thank you so much.

1092
01:21:31.980 --> 01:21:33.789
Take care, bye.

1093
01:21:35.620 --> 01:21:39.261
Nixon has promised
to sell our grapes in Europe.


1094
01:21:39.380 --> 01:21:40.791
And whatever's leftover

1095
01:21:40.860 --> 01:21:44.148
he'll have the Department of Defense
buy and feed to our soldiers.


1096
01:22:06.940 --> 01:22:08.351
<i>They're getting you
out in five days,</i>


1097
01:22:08.420 --> 01:22:10.229
but I'm not sure about the others.

1098
01:22:10.300 --> 01:22:11.711
It's all lies.

1099
01:22:12.220 --> 01:22:13.710
They're saying we provoked them.

1100
01:22:13.780 --> 01:22:17.068
That the strike is not legal, they are
painting us to look like criminals.


1101
01:22:17.260 --> 01:22:20.503
And ever since they dumped the grapes
in Europe, their sales have gone up there.


1102
01:22:23.660 --> 01:22:25.230
By 140%.

1103
01:22:35.620 --> 01:22:37.429
We're not gonna survive Nixon.

1104
01:22:43.260 --> 01:22:44.625
Then we have to go over there.

1105
01:22:46.700 --> 01:22:47.906
To Europe?

1106
01:22:49.980 --> 01:22:52.347
If they're running, we have to catch them.

1107
01:22:53.660 --> 01:22:56.140
We can barely keep things together here,
Mansi.


1108
01:22:56.220 --> 01:22:57.301
I know.

1109
01:23:19.820 --> 01:23:22.420
I never thought
I'd be saying this in my life.


1110
01:23:25.220 --> 01:23:28.349
To Richard Milhous Nixon!

1111
01:23:28.820 --> 01:23:30.026
To Nixon!

1112
01:23:45.340 --> 01:23:48.150
Focus on human law,
since it actually exists over in Europe.


1113
01:23:48.260 --> 01:23:50.706
The growers have completely
subverted the system here,


1114
01:23:50.780 --> 01:23:52.703
but Europe still defends workers' rights.

1115
01:23:52.780 --> 01:23:55.220
- - I hear they
get one month vacations there.


1116
01:23:55.740 --> 01:23:57.265
You might want to mention that

1117
01:23:57.340 --> 01:24:00.184
Vietnam is basically awash
in Bogdanovich's grapes and napalm.


1118
01:24:00.260 --> 01:24:01.989
I heard the food is terrible over there.

1119
01:24:02.060 --> 01:24:05.109
I don't care how bad the food is,
you're not starting a fast, Cesar.


1120
01:24:05.180 --> 01:24:06.261
Where is my coat?

1121
01:24:15.300 --> 01:24:16.461
<i>CESAR". Hey, Helen.</i>

1122
01:24:16.580 --> 01:24:18.309
You should see this place.

1123
01:24:18.580 --> 01:24:19.991
How are the kids?

1124
01:24:21.340 --> 01:24:22.580
And Fernando?

1125
01:24:25.380 --> 01:24:26.381
Okay.

1126
01:24:26.540 --> 01:24:29.020
<i>I'll see you in a couple of days.</i>

1127
01:24:30.380 --> 01:24:31.427
Fares please.

1128
01:24:31.700 --> 01:24:32.747
Yes, sir.

1129
01:24:32.820 --> 01:24:33.941
- Albert.
- 2p please.


1130
01:24:55.500 --> 01:24:57.867
- Mr. Chavez?
- Yes.


1131
01:24:58.900 --> 01:24:59.947
Lovely to meet you.

1132
01:25:00.060 --> 01:25:01.346
- Nice to meet you.
- Welcome.


1133
01:25:07.940 --> 01:25:10.261
We're here with Cesar Chavez,
the civil rights activist,


1134
01:25:10.340 --> 01:25:13.105
who has caused quite a stir in America
from his ongoing boycott


1135
01:25:13.260 --> 01:25:16.230
<i>that has meant millions of Americans
have stopped eating table grapes.</i>


1136
01:25:16.300 --> 01:25:17.426
Does that work for you, Mr. Chavez?

1137
01:25:17.540 --> 01:25:18.701
Thank you.

1138
01:25:21.260 --> 01:25:23.580
<i>We are making a plea
of common sense, to an industry</i>


1139
01:25:23.620 --> 01:25:26.783
<i>that refuses to recognize
the basic human rights of its workers.</i>


1140
01:25:26.940 --> 01:25:30.023
<i>Besides this boycott,
your movement has marched and striked</i>


1141
01:25:30.100 --> 01:25:32.307
<i>and you yourself have
done a 25 day fast.</i>

1142
01:25:32.420 --> 01:25:33.581
<i>Why has it gone this far?</i>

1143
01:25:33.740 --> 01:25:37.631
<i>Well, despite the success we had
against the growers in California,</i>


1144
01:25:38.300 --> 01:25:40.382
<i>they still refuse
to sit down and negotiate with us.</i>


1145
01:25:41.220 --> 01:25:43.461
And it's not
a question of economics anymore.


1146
01:25:44.660 --> 01:25:46.230
<i>It's more a stubbornness.</i>

1147
01:25:46.460 --> 01:25:48.667
<i>They want to show that
they're strong and not weak.</i>


1148
01:25:48.780 --> 01:25:50.384
<i>So they would
rather export the grapes</i>


1149
01:25:50.460 --> 01:25:51.985
<i>than sit down and negotiate with you?</i>

1150
01:25:52.300 --> 01:25:55.065
They'd rather sell their grapes to London,
or Stockholm


1151
01:25:55.260 --> 01:25:58.343
and think that that will erase all
the indignities that people have suffered.


1152
01:26:00.100 --> 01:26:02.660
<i>And what kind of support have you
received here in Great Britain?</i>


1153
01:26:02.820 --> 01:26:06.029
Here in Britain, we have the Transport and
General Workers Union support,


1154
01:26:07.300 --> 01:26:09.302
<i>and they have endorsed our boycott.</i>

1155
01:26:11.980 --> 01:26:13.982
<i>The dock loaders refuse to unload grapes.</i>

1156
01:26:14.300 --> 01:26:15.381
What are you saying to me now?

1157
01:26:15.460 --> 01:26:17.349
Wait a minute! 
We had a deal!

1158
01:26:17.460 --> 01:26:19.827
Which is a great endorsement
of our boycott.


1159
01:26:20.980 --> 01:26:24.985
<i>We're optimistic to have
similar support from other countries.</i>


1160
01:26:25.140 --> 01:26:29.304
<i>Diverse religious groups throughout the
continent have shown their support.</i>


1161
01:26:29.460 --> 01:26:32.589
<i>Even the Pope has agreed to meet us.</i>

1162
01:26:32.660 --> 01:26:35.140
I've got them grapes
halfway through the Atlantic.


1163
01:26:37.300 --> 01:26:38.461
Hello?

1164
01:26:38.820 --> 01:26:40.504
So, what are you hoping to achieve?

1165
01:26:43.340 --> 01:26:44.671
<i>Well, it's never been
about the grapes.</i>


1166
01:26:44.740 --> 01:26:46.101
<i>It's always been about the people.</i>

1167
01:26:46.300 --> 01:26:48.826
<i>The poorest of the poor, the marginalized.</i>

1168
01:26:49.220 --> 01:26:50.506
<i>The ones who have been ignored.</i>

1169
01:26:54.220 --> 01:26:56.826
<i>There would be no food on the table
without these people.</i>


1170
01:27:01.020 --> 01:27:04.547
<i>And these people have
names, faces, families.</i>


1171
01:27:07.700 --> 01:27:11.022
<i>And I guess what we want to accomplish
is to give these people a voice.</i>


1172
01:27:20.700 --> 01:27:23.829
<i>But will this be enough,
considering the amount of resistance?</i>


1173
01:27:24.660 --> 01:27:26.708
Once social change begins,

1174
01:27:27.740 --> 01:27:29.265
it can't be reversed.

1175
01:27:30.940 --> 01:27:33.386
<i>You can't uneducate someone
who has learned how to read.</i>


1176
01:27:35.060 --> 01:27:38.223
<i>You can't humiliate someone
who has pride.</i>


1177
01:27:43.740 --> 01:27:47.028
You can't oppress someone
who is not afraid anymore.


1178
01:27:48.060 --> 01:27:50.028
We have seen the future
and the future is ours.


1179
01:27:58.580 --> 01:27:59.581
Ready?

1180
01:29:03.460 --> 01:29:04.461
Don't answer it!

1181
01:29:04.660 --> 01:29:05.707
I'm right here.

1182
01:29:06.180 --> 01:29:09.548
Don't take three hours.
I have to drop this off.


1183
01:29:23.620 --> 01:29:24.667
What's wrong?

1184
01:29:25.460 --> 01:29:26.507
They want to sign.

1185
01:29:27.220 --> 01:29:28.221
Who?

1186
01:29:28.660 --> 01:29:32.062
All of them. All
the growers want to sign.

1187
01:30:03.860 --> 01:30:05.862
It's an interesting day
you choose to be late.


1188
01:30:07.220 --> 01:30:09.109
Come on, they are waiting inside.

1189
01:30:48.380 --> 01:30:51.101
You have to admit,
this old Croat put up a hell of a fight.


1190
01:30:51.780 --> 01:30:55.421
Yeah, I can do that, as long as you can
admit this little Mexican kicked your ass.


1191
01:31:00.900 --> 01:31:02.580
<i>Brothers and sisters of the fields,</i>

1192
01:31:04.780 --> 01:31:07.431
<i>all around us were those
who said it could never be done.</i>


1193
01:31:09.100 --> 01:31:12.627
<i>People said that
the growers were too powerful,</i>


1194
01:31:15.220 --> 01:31:16.904
<i>the police would be against us...</i>

1195
01:31:18.660 --> 01:31:20.469
And the courts would beat us down,

1196
01:31:21.780 --> 01:31:22.780
and that sooner or later

1197
01:31:22.820 --> 01:31:25.824
we would fall back into the poverty
and despair of our forefathers.


1198
01:31:26.500 --> 01:31:27.786
But we didn't!

1199
01:31:29.780 --> 01:31:30.941
We didn't

1200
01:31:31.740 --> 01:31:33.185
because our common suffering

1201
01:31:34.180 --> 01:31:36.467
and love for each other kept us together.

1202
01:31:39.980 --> 01:31:41.630
Five years we were on strike!

1203
01:31:45.180 --> 01:31:48.423
It kept us sacrificing and fighting
for a better tomorrow,


1204
01:31:49.580 --> 01:31:51.503
a better tomorrow that we all dream about

1205
01:31:52.300 --> 01:31:54.462
as we work among these beautiful vines.

1206
01:31:56.100 --> 01:31:59.149
And when millions and millions of
Americans stopped doing one thing,


1207
01:31:59.980 --> 01:32:01.186
eating grapes,

1208
01:32:02.300 --> 01:32:03.790
we won the strike!

1209
01:32:04.380 --> 01:32:05.541
We won!

1210
01:32:11.580 --> 01:32:13.070
Yes, we can!

1211
01:32:58.820 --> 01:33:01.710
<i>I know there is no way
to justify the things that I've done...</i>


1212
01:33:02.380 --> 01:33:04.189
<i>Or that I've not done for you.</i>

1213
01:33:05.020 --> 01:33:06.909
<i>It saddens me to think that</i>

1214
01:33:07.220 --> 01:33:09.541
<i>we never got a chance
to go fishing together</i>


1215
01:33:10.340 --> 01:33:12.104
<i>or catch a baseball game</i>

1216
01:33:12.780 --> 01:33:14.384
<i>or even go watch a movie.</i>

1217
01:33:16.380 --> 01:33:18.348
<i>There's no way to turn back the clock</i>

1218
01:33:19.060 --> 01:33:20.391
<i>and to make up for lost time.</i>

1219
01:33:22.780 --> 01:33:23.861
<i>But I want you to know that</i>

1220
01:33:23.900 --> 01:33:26.187
<i>your mother and I
miss you very much, Fernando.</i>


1221
01:33:28.180 --> 01:33:29.909
<i>It seems so ironic to think that,</i>

1222
01:33:30.020 --> 01:33:33.388
<i>because I've tried to do things that
my father could never do for us,</i>


1223
01:33:34.420 --> 01:33:36.070
<i>I'm now so distant from you.</i>

1224
01:33:38.780 --> 01:33:41.750
<i>Please know that
the day you came into this world</i>


1225
01:33:41.860 --> 01:33:44.466
<i>was also the day that I
received the clarity</i>


1226
01:33:45.260 --> 01:33:46.989
<i>that I so desperately needed.</i>

1227
01:33:48.900 --> 01:33:50.709
<i>You and your brothers and sisters</i>

1228
01:33:51.420 --> 01:33:53.149
<i>are the purpose for my struggle.</i>

1229
01:33:54.100 --> 01:33:55.590
<i>Everything I do is for you.</i>

1230
01:33:56.780 --> 01:33:58.623
<i>And I hope you remember that.</i>

1231
01:33:59.940 --> 01:34:02.420
<i>I also hope that one day</i>

1232
01:34:03.220 --> 01:34:05.826
<i>you can be as proud of
me as I am of you.</i>

1233
01:34:42.020 --> 01:34:43.988
<i>But I want
more than anything else,</i>


1234
01:34:44.060 --> 01:34:45.505
<i>I would like to see the poor</i>

1235
01:34:47.780 --> 01:34:50.511
<i>take a very direct part in shaping society.</i>

1236
01:34:50.620 --> 01:34:52.190
<i>And let them make the decisions.</i>

1237
01:34:52.980 --> 01:34:56.507
<i>And in our case, if the poor are not
involved, then change will never come.</i>
