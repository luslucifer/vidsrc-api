1
00:00:09.333 --> 00:00:12.684
Mitch: Really don't know
where to go from here.


2
00:00:12.728 --> 00:00:15.818
Maybe before I move forward,

3
00:00:15.861 --> 00:00:17.733
I got to understand
how I got here.


4
00:00:24.392 --> 00:00:26.872
Franco: They were headed to
the airport, boarding a plane.


5
00:00:26.916 --> 00:00:29.788
Mitch: So, where's Rinaldo?
He's in Cuba?


6
00:00:29.832 --> 00:00:33.183
They flew to, you know,
parts unknown, offshore.


7
00:00:33.227 --> 00:00:35.533
You should see the footage--

8
00:00:35.577 --> 00:00:38.623
hookers, bottle service,
you name it.


9
00:00:38.667 --> 00:00:40.930
He could be a dangerous man.

10
00:00:40.973 --> 00:00:42.540
Mike:
About our money here,


11
00:00:42.584 --> 00:00:44.151
the people that I deal with,
they're a bunch of mugs.


12
00:00:44.194 --> 00:00:45.978
These guys want
their money back.


13
00:00:46.022 --> 00:00:47.371
They feel they're getting
bamboozled all over the place,


14
00:00:47.415 --> 00:00:49.156
right, and they don't
like doing that.


15
00:00:49.199 --> 00:00:51.288
- Uh, no problem.
- Mike: It's not a problem?


16
00:00:51.332 --> 00:00:53.116
- It's not a problem
to me, my friend.


17
00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:54.857
So, why don't you tell me how
we're gonna get our money back?


18
00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:57.164
At Harvard, we learn about
how to be a bull-shitter,


19
00:00:57.207 --> 00:00:58.426
how to Harvard-bullshit.

20
00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:00.167
You know, it's like a course.

21
00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.604
So, let's hope your "trust me"
is a guaranteed "trust me"


22
00:01:02.647 --> 00:01:04.301
'cause I've heard it
a million times before.


23
00:01:04.345 --> 00:01:06.303
Okay, don't trust me,
but I'm not going anywhere.


24
00:01:06.347 --> 00:01:08.044
- Mike: Thank you.
- Mitch: Okay.


25
00:01:08.088 --> 00:01:09.524
Mike: I'm going to take you
as a man of your word.


26
00:01:09.567 --> 00:01:11.395
Franco: Who's funding
this guy's fantasy life?


27
00:01:11.439 --> 00:01:13.005
Did you give him any money?

28
00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:15.443
Rinaldo wants to do his project,
wherever that is.


29
00:01:15.486 --> 00:01:19.316
I'm running through the books as
we're investing in his project.


30
00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:22.145
I'm getting out of the country

31
00:01:22.189 --> 00:01:24.191
and I have some time

32
00:01:24.234 --> 00:01:26.889
to get to know his
beautiful wife, Julianne.


33
00:01:26.932 --> 00:01:30.545
Well, here I was thinking
I was in control.


34
00:01:35.071 --> 00:01:37.552
As you know,
it's a crumbling house of cards.


35
00:01:37.595 --> 00:01:40.337
I think our time is done here.

36
00:01:40.381 --> 00:01:43.688
Just be calm.
Pretend everything's all right.


37
00:01:43.732 --> 00:01:46.648
If, um-- if they start
seizing the equipment,


38
00:01:46.691 --> 00:01:50.782
just tell 'em we don't own it.
It's leased. They can't have it.


39
00:01:50.826 --> 00:01:53.176
So, we better,
like, move quickly.


40
00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.744
And I see the backstairs,
so let's move quickly.


41
00:01:55.787 --> 00:01:58.094
You should go,
and I'll talk to Doreen.


42
00:01:58.138 --> 00:01:59.574
I'll make sure
she gets out of here.


43
00:01:59.617 --> 00:02:01.184
Doreen? Doreen?

44
00:02:01.228 --> 00:02:02.446
[knocking]

45
00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:03.839
[whispering] You got to go.

46
00:02:03.882 --> 00:02:05.362
They're coming for us.
You got to go.


47
00:02:05.406 --> 00:02:06.929
Yeah, yeah. We got to go.

48
00:02:06.972 --> 00:02:08.844
I would go immediately
down the staircase.


49
00:02:08.887 --> 00:02:12.413
I'll bring my car around and
I'll see you in the alleyway.


50
00:02:12.456 --> 00:02:15.285
Put the equipment in my car
and we'll keep moving.


51
00:02:15.329 --> 00:02:18.984
Okay. Don't look back.
We're good.


52
00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:25.034
Could you help me
take the sign off, actually?


53
00:02:25.077 --> 00:02:27.297
We don't have time.
I got to go. I got to go, guys.


54
00:02:27.341 --> 00:02:29.604
Well, I thought
I was in control.


55
00:02:29.647 --> 00:02:31.214
I thought I was the king.

56
00:02:31.258 --> 00:02:33.869
I thought I was
running a studio;


57
00:02:33.912 --> 00:02:36.785
hiring, firing, making
decisions, getting money,


58
00:02:36.828 --> 00:02:39.179
handing money out.

59
00:02:42.617 --> 00:02:52.617
â™ª

60
00:03:20.176 --> 00:03:22.483
So, guys,
slight little wrinkle.


61
00:03:22.526 --> 00:03:24.441
Some funds didn't
come in as I'd like


62
00:03:24.485 --> 00:03:25.921
and our lease was up,

63
00:03:25.964 --> 00:03:27.488
and they were taking
some of our stuff.


64
00:03:27.531 --> 00:03:31.013
So, I thought we'd, um,
be on the move a little bit.


65
00:03:31.056 --> 00:03:34.886
We're gonna, you know, try to
pull together this season


66
00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:37.846
in sort of a really--
how would I put it?


67
00:03:37.889 --> 00:03:40.675
Low-cost,
but very cost-effective way.


68
00:03:40.718 --> 00:03:43.373
You know, we have
some really great actors that,


69
00:03:43.417 --> 00:03:45.157
you know, I've e-mailed out,

70
00:03:45.201 --> 00:03:46.985
and hopefully
will be joining us.


71
00:03:47.029 --> 00:03:50.815
And I think back and probably
my closest relationship


72
00:03:50.859 --> 00:03:53.427
throughout this whole project
was with Franco.


73
00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:58.127
So, I have an idea.

74
00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:00.521
I'm going to call Franco.

75
00:04:02.784 --> 00:04:04.133
I liked him,
I didn't like him.


76
00:04:04.176 --> 00:04:05.656
We're friends,
we're not friends.


77
00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:08.006
He relied up on me,
I relied upon him.


78
00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:09.791
We're not in our old studio,

79
00:04:09.834 --> 00:04:11.358
but we're moving into
another studio.


80
00:04:11.401 --> 00:04:13.229
But we thought we'd really
go guerrilla filmmaking,


81
00:04:13.273 --> 00:04:15.971
out on the street,
doing stuff together.


82
00:04:16.014 --> 00:04:18.495
So, you know-
- Franco?

83
00:04:18.539 --> 00:04:21.716
And I was just
his little bitch. Wow.


84
00:04:21.759 --> 00:04:23.892
I think one of the best ideas is
we're just gonna, like, wing it.


85
00:04:23.935 --> 00:04:25.633
And we have a few ideas.

86
00:04:25.676 --> 00:04:27.809
We're just going to, like,
stop people on the street.


87
00:04:27.852 --> 00:04:29.245
And these are
really great characters.


88
00:04:29.289 --> 00:04:30.899
These are, like,
the bedrock of society,


89
00:04:30.942 --> 00:04:32.335
hardworking entrepreneurs.

90
00:04:32.379 --> 00:04:34.859
Man: Security is coming.
We just saw security.


91
00:04:34.903 --> 00:04:36.687
Security is coming,

92
00:04:36.731 --> 00:04:38.907
so I think we're gonna have to
move on to another location.


93
00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:41.779
But thank you. We're moving
and we're having a good time.


94
00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:14.508
[playing mellow Latin music]

95
00:05:18.338 --> 00:05:22.342
I hope I will make you proud
and--


96
00:05:29.958 --> 00:05:34.832
It's hard.
We all miss you, and


97
00:05:34.876 --> 00:05:37.835
I just on keep hearing
that you are a nice--


98
00:05:37.879 --> 00:05:39.446
you are a nice guy.

99
00:05:39.489 --> 00:05:43.188
And I know you are a nice guy,

100
00:05:43.232 --> 00:05:45.756
and we just want you
with us


101
00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:49.151
and we miss you a lot.

102
00:05:49.194 --> 00:05:52.197
I love you.
Come back soon.


103
00:06:19.616 --> 00:06:23.272
From here,
where does this show go now?


104
00:06:23.315 --> 00:06:27.015
I mean, it's been-- it's been
some years and some work.


105
00:06:27.058 --> 00:06:30.018
A lot of years, a lot of money,
and admittedly,


106
00:06:30.061 --> 00:06:34.109
we're very low on money
and we're not stopping.


107
00:06:34.152 --> 00:06:37.286
We're going to figure this out,
beg, borrow or steal.


108
00:06:37.329 --> 00:06:40.724
And we may have
to leave the country, um...


109
00:06:40.768 --> 00:06:43.771
to escape predators,
and what better place to go--


110
00:06:43.814 --> 00:06:45.425
Predators or creditors?

111
00:06:45.468 --> 00:06:48.253
Predators and creditors.
Good reference there.


112
00:06:48.297 --> 00:06:50.865
There's a place
that I love to go to


113
00:06:50.908 --> 00:06:53.041
where it'd be tough
to extradite us,


114
00:06:53.084 --> 00:06:56.131
for one, would be Cuba.

115
00:06:56.174 --> 00:06:58.394
So, I mean, you've heard of
great shows like Narcos.


116
00:06:58.438 --> 00:07:00.091
- Yeah.
- We're inspired by that.


117
00:07:00.135 --> 00:07:02.180
And we have our own
Narcos-type guy.


118
00:07:02.224 --> 00:07:04.052
We have a guy, Don Punta.

119
00:07:04.095 --> 00:07:06.881
It's going to be his story.
That's one of our stories,


120
00:07:06.924 --> 00:07:09.057
the rise and fall of Don Punta.

121
00:07:09.100 --> 00:07:11.625
So, that's our show, but also,

122
00:07:11.668 --> 00:07:14.149
we have a reality
outside the show.


123
00:07:14.192 --> 00:07:16.194
And this Don Punta,
who has some of our money,


124
00:07:16.238 --> 00:07:17.848
is filming down there.

125
00:07:17.892 --> 00:07:20.503
We believe he may have
taken the $20 million.


126
00:07:20.547 --> 00:07:23.767
So, we have a mystery within
a mystery, within a mystery.


127
00:07:23.811 --> 00:07:27.162
We're gonna be dealing with one
of our guys who's filming,


128
00:07:27.205 --> 00:07:29.381
the least one you suspect,
the stupidest,


129
00:07:29.425 --> 00:07:31.253
the most ridiculous,

130
00:07:31.296 --> 00:07:34.996
the worst dressed,
and he may be the guy.


131
00:07:35.039 --> 00:07:38.173
Well, regardless,
when you come back from Cuba,


132
00:07:38.216 --> 00:07:40.088
if you come back alive,
let's get down--


133
00:07:40.131 --> 00:07:41.959
sit down and you
tell me about it again.


134
00:07:42.003 --> 00:07:43.613
- I'd love to do that.
- All right.


135
00:07:47.748 --> 00:07:50.751
Goran: You have guys like
these other characters,


136
00:07:50.794 --> 00:07:54.102
Mild Ricky and Lars
and all these guys,


137
00:07:54.145 --> 00:07:55.973
and what happened to them all?

138
00:07:56.017 --> 00:07:57.540
I am going in
a different direction.


139
00:07:57.584 --> 00:08:00.891
I was always, you know,
the quiet, prudish,


140
00:08:00.935 --> 00:08:04.504
no-drinking, no-cocaine
type of guy. No hookers.


141
00:08:04.547 --> 00:08:06.244
But I think I'm evolving.

142
00:08:06.288 --> 00:08:09.900
We have the booze and the drugs
and the cocaine and the opioids.


143
00:08:09.944 --> 00:08:11.772
Why the fuck not?

144
00:08:11.815 --> 00:08:14.688
I like to make
a total decadent scene.


145
00:08:14.731 --> 00:08:17.342
You know, making love
with these beautiful hookers


146
00:08:17.386 --> 00:08:19.562
or snorting coke
off of Rinaldo's ass.


147
00:08:19.606 --> 00:08:20.781
That'd be fabulous.

148
00:08:20.824 --> 00:08:22.522
[coughing]

149
00:08:22.565 --> 00:08:24.785
You know what?
Maybe you're brilliant.


150
00:08:24.828 --> 00:08:26.961
- Mitch: I know I'm brilliant.
- Maybe.


151
00:08:27.004 --> 00:08:28.963
So, I'm in this,
you're in this,


152
00:08:29.006 --> 00:08:31.008
Rinaldo's in this.
That's three.


153
00:08:31.052 --> 00:08:33.620
And there's a guy, Malik,
who's Cuban, my understanding.


154
00:08:33.663 --> 00:08:35.752
- Goran: Let's begin...
- Yes.


155
00:08:35.796 --> 00:08:38.625
...with a Pepto-Bismol.
Is there one around here?


156
00:08:38.668 --> 00:08:40.235
Mitch: You're going to be
a star as an actor,


157
00:08:40.278 --> 00:08:41.628
being a director,
being a character.


158
00:08:41.671 --> 00:08:42.977
Goran:
Just need a minute.


159
00:08:43.020 --> 00:08:44.935
Mitch:
We're going to be the new Cuba.


160
00:08:58.645 --> 00:08:59.950
We're coming to the end,

161
00:08:59.994 --> 00:09:03.301
coming to
the end of this journey.


162
00:09:20.623 --> 00:09:22.320
Mitch:
It's really just me.


163
00:09:22.364 --> 00:09:24.845
I have no more friends.

164
00:09:24.888 --> 00:09:26.455
Rick is not to be seen.

165
00:09:26.498 --> 00:09:30.111
I just have Miko.
And I don't know, though.


166
00:09:30.154 --> 00:09:34.419
Miko is a great dog.

167
00:09:34.463 --> 00:09:36.639
And I may not be around.

168
00:09:36.683 --> 00:09:38.902
I may not be around to see Miko.

169
00:09:38.946 --> 00:09:43.211
And Miko deserves
someone better:


170
00:09:43.254 --> 00:09:46.562
someone who, you know,
he could look up to,


171
00:09:46.606 --> 00:09:48.608
who could inspire him.

172
00:10:18.289 --> 00:10:19.900
It may be
the end of my journey,


173
00:10:19.943 --> 00:10:21.597
and you're not even two yet.

174
00:10:21.641 --> 00:10:23.077
Who's going to look after you?

175
00:10:23.120 --> 00:10:27.124
Who's going to be there
on your second birthday?


176
00:10:28.648 --> 00:10:29.823
I do have an idea.

177
00:10:29.866 --> 00:10:32.869
I think you'll like my choice.

178
00:10:35.524 --> 00:10:39.006
â™ª Ice weighs heavy
on my wings tonight â™ª


179
00:10:39.049 --> 00:10:43.706
Miko, you've been
a great dog and a good friend,


180
00:10:43.750 --> 00:10:47.754
my only friend.

181
00:10:47.797 --> 00:10:50.104
â™ª And if I could leave

182
00:10:50.147 --> 00:10:53.542
â™ª On a summer breeze

183
00:10:53.585 --> 00:10:58.547
â™ª I would surely leave
this place â™ª


184
00:10:58.590 --> 00:11:02.029
â™ª I would
surely leave this place â™ª


185
00:11:05.293 --> 00:11:08.296
I'll miss you, guy.
I'll miss you, boy.


186
00:11:13.344 --> 00:11:15.869
â™ª All the autumn days
have come and gone â™ª

â™ª Shadows lengthen on the wall

00:12:18.105 --> 00:12:19.933
I have another thing for them.

[crunching]

196
00:12:28.985 --> 00:12:32.380
This Mitch guy,
I should keep my eye on him.


197
00:12:32.423 --> 00:12:35.775
I have certain doubts.

198
00:12:35.818 --> 00:12:38.386
[no audio]

199
00:12:43.043 --> 00:12:45.306

but at home,

00:12:45.349 --> 00:12:48.483
some nice chick
waiting for us, man.


201
00:13:04.368 --> 00:13:08.982
Hey, chiquita,
can I have a toothpick?


202
00:13:09.025 --> 00:13:11.811
No. Toothpick?

203
00:14:17.398 --> 00:14:19.530
Rinaldo:
I love the chicas here, man.


204
00:14:19.574 --> 00:14:22.794
All the chicks.
The whole environment.


205
00:14:22.838 --> 00:14:24.840
Mmm...

206
00:14:30.715 --> 00:14:32.456
Mitch: Where is this guy?

207
00:14:35.895 --> 00:14:39.072
We just came from the airport.
I got the director. I got Malik.


208
00:14:39.115 --> 00:14:41.335
Like, we're supposed to
have a meeting. We're all ready.


209
00:14:41.378 --> 00:14:42.989
I got it, I got it.

210
00:14:43.032 --> 00:14:44.991
Look.
Everything is taken care of.


211
00:14:45.034 --> 00:14:48.864
Listen. The Spanish way, okay,

212
00:14:48.908 --> 00:14:52.215
is fun and work, fun and work.

213
00:14:52.259 --> 00:14:54.957
You know what I mean?
Now is fun time.


214
00:14:55.001 --> 00:14:56.959
Work time later.

215
00:14:57.003 --> 00:14:58.482
Mitch: All right.
We're going to come down.


216
00:14:58.526 --> 00:15:00.745
Rinaldo: These are
my friends here, man,


217
00:15:00.789 --> 00:15:02.356
and you, actually--
you can come and join me here.


218
00:15:02.399 --> 00:15:04.053
This is so unprofessional.

219
00:15:04.097 --> 00:15:07.187
I was telling
what a great visionary you were,


220
00:15:07.230 --> 00:15:09.276
that you're amazing.

221
00:15:09.319 --> 00:15:10.973
Just come over. Have fun.

222
00:15:11.017 --> 00:15:12.801
We're going to have
a little party later


223
00:15:12.844 --> 00:15:15.325
where there'll be dancing
and all that stuff, whatever.


224
00:15:15.369 --> 00:15:17.980
I guess we're not going to go
through a production meeting.


225
00:15:18.024 --> 00:15:20.896
We're not going to talk about
the script or anything tonight.


226
00:15:20.940 --> 00:15:23.725
Of course, man. We can
always go into the details


227
00:15:23.768 --> 00:15:25.770
later on in my office, right?

228
00:15:25.814 --> 00:15:29.383
You know what?
Like, he may have a point.


229
00:15:29.426 --> 00:15:33.082
Also, it's in the budget.
It's in the budget.


230
00:15:33.126 --> 00:15:35.606
We might as well, you know,
listen to him.


231
00:15:35.650 --> 00:15:38.174
We might as well,
like, shift gears.


232
00:15:38.218 --> 00:15:40.307
Are you convincing me
or yourself?


233
00:15:40.350 --> 00:15:42.265
I'm trying to convince myself.
Am I convincing you?


234
00:15:42.309 --> 00:15:43.745
I don't know. Come on, come on.

235
00:15:43.788 --> 00:15:45.138
I'm just going to go
do some work here.


236
00:15:45.181 --> 00:15:46.922
You're not going to join us?

237
00:15:46.966 --> 00:15:48.358
- I'm not going to join you.
- It's a little downtime.


238
00:15:48.402 --> 00:15:49.620
- That's fine with me.
- Thank you.


239
00:15:49.664 --> 00:15:51.013
You guys do what you got to do.

240
00:15:51.057 --> 00:15:52.797
- Okay.
- All right?


241
00:15:52.841 --> 00:15:54.408
- All right. You can go back.
Malik, are you with me, man?


242
00:15:54.451 --> 00:15:56.018
- Malik: Yeah.
- Mitch: Okay, Malik's with me.


243
00:15:56.062 --> 00:15:58.716
Good. I like that.
You come to an agreement, right?


244
00:15:58.760 --> 00:16:00.196
As you know, Rinaldo,

245
00:16:00.240 --> 00:16:03.460
Don Punta, this is Malik.
He's our host.


246
00:16:03.504 --> 00:16:05.245
He speaks Spanish, but also,

247
00:16:05.288 --> 00:16:07.638
I think he has a great career
as an actor


248
00:16:07.682 --> 00:16:09.727
or as a director.

249
00:16:09.771 --> 00:16:11.120
And I think it's worthwhile,

250
00:16:11.164 --> 00:16:13.209
since we have
these lovely actresses,


251
00:16:13.253 --> 00:16:15.211
that we're going to sort of
show them how--


252
00:16:15.255 --> 00:16:16.560
the auditioning process.

253
00:16:16.604 --> 00:16:18.040
Take advantage of that.

254
00:16:18.084 --> 00:16:19.476
I like that idea.
That's fine with me, man.


255
00:16:19.520 --> 00:16:21.435
You know,
we test the actresses out


256
00:16:21.478 --> 00:16:23.393
to see whether they can
cut the mustard, if you will.


257
00:16:23.437 --> 00:16:26.309
I'm Don Punta, man.
This is my town here. Okay?


258
00:16:26.353 --> 00:16:28.703
I'm taking care
of all of you guys.


259

- Cameraman: Yep.

Rinaldo:
Yeah. Give her a kiss.

Rinaldo:
Where's the music now?

Hey. Now, the music?

Hey, Malik, are you my host?

- Mitch: Okay, okay.

00:19:59.479 --> 00:20:02.046
Let's rename this Don Punta.

307
00:20:02.090 --> 00:20:05.267
Forget the Punta Brothers 'cause
no one wants to be your brother.


308
00:20:05.311 --> 00:20:08.357
You know? So, are we going to
change the title at least?


309
00:20:08.401 --> 00:20:09.489
Can we agree on that?

310
00:20:09.532 --> 00:20:11.055
â™ª I like it like that

311
00:20:11.099 --> 00:20:13.580
You know that song?
I love it, man.


312
00:20:13.623 --> 00:20:16.583
Listen. I'm going to
teach you something, okay?


313
00:20:16.626 --> 00:20:19.542
These are little step-by-step.

314
00:20:19.586 --> 00:20:22.893
I'm going to give a break
to these beautiful girls.


315
00:20:22.937 --> 00:20:24.547
They're going to freshen up
for me.


316
00:20:24.591 --> 00:20:27.115
Look at this toe.

317
00:20:27.158 --> 00:20:29.987
See? Gentle, nice.

318
00:20:30.031 --> 00:20:33.295
Look at the other one.
Look at this. See?


319
00:20:33.339 --> 00:20:35.819
One day, you're going to
get there, like me, man.


320
00:20:35.863 --> 00:20:39.040
Look at that.

321
00:20:39.083 --> 00:20:42.261
Just get the-- you know,
the tap, a bubble bath.


322
00:20:42.304 --> 00:20:45.786
In the meantime,
you can go ahead, okay?


323
00:20:55.186 --> 00:20:58.102
Malik:
Don Punta, here's Mitch.


324
00:20:58.146 --> 00:20:59.365
Rinaldo!

325
00:20:59.408 --> 00:21:00.627
Rinaldo:
Hey, Mitch.


326
00:21:00.670 --> 00:21:02.411
How are you, man?

327
00:21:02.455 --> 00:21:04.457
Rinaldo, my friend...

328
00:21:04.500 --> 00:21:05.936
Yeah? Speak up, man.

329
00:21:05.980 --> 00:21:07.242
Speak up?

330
00:21:07.286 --> 00:21:09.026
Yeah. What's your concern?

331
00:21:09.070 --> 00:21:12.421
My concern.
Remember I gave you $250,000?


332
00:21:12.465 --> 00:21:14.205
You came to me, to my office.

333
00:21:14.249 --> 00:21:16.033
You said you're an actor

334
00:21:16.077 --> 00:21:19.907
and you had a dream to do
a film called Punta Brothers.


335
00:21:19.950 --> 00:21:21.474
- Right.
- And...


336
00:21:21.517 --> 00:21:22.736
Yeah, and?

337
00:21:22.779 --> 00:21:24.520
It seems to be in trouble.

338
00:21:24.564 --> 00:21:26.217
What's going on?
Tell me what happened to--


339
00:21:26.261 --> 00:21:28.394
Trouble? See, that word
"trouble," I don't like it, man.


340
00:21:28.437 --> 00:21:31.919
"Trouble,"
it's out of my vocabulary.


341
00:21:31.962 --> 00:21:35.314
Malik come fresh. This guy...

342
00:21:35.357 --> 00:21:37.011
Mitch:
Malik come fresh?


343
00:21:37.054 --> 00:21:40.101
Malik is, uh-- he's my host.
He has no acting ability.


344
00:21:40.144 --> 00:21:43.931
Hey, I already talked to him.
He's taking care of it.


345
00:21:43.974 --> 00:21:45.236
What are you doing? Like...

346
00:21:45.280 --> 00:21:46.847
You fucked my wife.

347
00:21:46.890 --> 00:21:48.239
What does that have
to do with anything?


348
00:21:48.283 --> 00:21:49.719
Hey, you know what?

349
00:21:49.763 --> 00:21:51.330
- You owe me.
- Why do I owe you?


350
00:21:51.373 --> 00:21:53.375
Remember, you came to me, idiot.

351
00:21:53.419 --> 00:21:56.596
You came to me, said,
"I need you to help out my wife.


352
00:21:56.639 --> 00:21:58.380
She has a problem
with the immigration."


353
00:21:58.424 --> 00:22:00.556
I said I'll help her out,
and in order to help her out,


354
00:22:00.600 --> 00:22:02.253
she had to become my fake wife.

355
00:22:02.297 --> 00:22:05.082
I just experienced
a come-to-Jesus moment.


356
00:22:05.126 --> 00:22:08.738
So, what are you blaming me for?
I loved her.


357
00:22:08.782 --> 00:22:10.392
You didn't love her.
I wanted her,


358
00:22:10.436 --> 00:22:12.829
and she ended up sleeping
with everybody else.


359
00:22:12.873 --> 00:22:14.309
You owe me, man!

360
00:22:14.353 --> 00:22:15.397
No. You owe me, man.

361
00:22:15.441 --> 00:22:16.790
You owe me.

362
00:22:16.833 --> 00:22:20.010
Mitch:
I want to take down Rinaldo


363
00:22:20.054 --> 00:22:22.622
and I want to walk off
into the sunset.


364
00:22:46.646 --> 00:22:49.475
Rinaldo, you look
a little hung over there, man.


365
00:22:49.518 --> 00:22:52.042
Oh, yeah. You know, things.

366
00:22:52.086 --> 00:22:54.393
Uh, I gave him $250,000.

367
00:22:54.436 --> 00:22:57.352
He promised me a screenplay.

368
00:22:57.396 --> 00:22:58.571
It was called
the Punta Brothers.


369
00:22:58.614 --> 00:23:00.007
You're not well?

370
00:23:00.050 --> 00:23:01.617
If you're not well,
we'll get you a doctor.


371
00:23:01.661 --> 00:23:04.098
I have no idea what's going on.
I mean, what happened?


372
00:23:04.141 --> 00:23:06.405
It's a stomach flu? Is it
intestinal flu? What's going on?


373
00:23:06.448 --> 00:23:07.797
Rinaldo:
Your man's still alive,


374
00:23:07.841 --> 00:23:09.233
so that's what matters, right?

375
00:23:09.277 --> 00:23:12.454
Rinaldo, we have
a large investment in you.


376
00:23:12.498 --> 00:23:15.283
Maybe there's a novel
out of this.


377
00:23:15.326 --> 00:23:16.589
Maybe if it's a great
screenplay,


378
00:23:16.632 --> 00:23:17.981
we could novelize it.

379
00:23:18.025 --> 00:23:20.070
They don't have
cocaine here in Cuba, man.


380
00:23:20.114 --> 00:23:21.724
It's not a big thing here.

381
00:23:21.768 --> 00:23:24.074
A screenplay leads to a novel,
maybe leads to a play.


382
00:23:24.118 --> 00:23:25.467
Maybe do a Broadway play.

383
00:23:25.511 --> 00:23:27.382
There's all kinds
of possibilities.


384
00:23:27.426 --> 00:23:28.601
Or maybe a TV series.

385
00:23:28.644 --> 00:23:31.125
Goran, Rinaldo? 
Let's sit down.

386
00:23:31.168 --> 00:23:33.083
Goran:
He's got some kind of script


387
00:23:33.127 --> 00:23:35.259
that I have to shoot.

388
00:23:35.303 --> 00:23:37.348
He's never written
anything before,


389
00:23:37.392 --> 00:23:41.875
so that's really
a confidence-builder.


390
00:23:41.918 --> 00:23:43.920
He's a great director,
but he used to be an actor.


391
00:23:43.964 --> 00:23:45.182
Now, he's a director.

392
00:23:45.226 --> 00:23:46.706
So he'll be both
a director and an actor.


393
00:23:46.749 --> 00:23:48.359
It's like a combo.

394
00:23:48.403 --> 00:23:49.752
Mitch: So, Goran should be
an interesting guy.


395
00:23:49.796 --> 00:23:51.188
I've heard
some wonderful things about him.


396
00:23:51.232 --> 00:23:53.408
He was a big star
in the '70s and '80s,


397
00:23:53.452 --> 00:23:55.149
an action figure.

398
00:23:55.192 --> 00:23:57.717
- So, the guy is good, eh?
- Mitch: He's really good.


399
00:23:57.760 --> 00:24:00.154
Played with a lot of
the major players in Hollywood,


400
00:24:00.197 --> 00:24:03.592
and now, he's transformed
himself into a director.


401
00:24:03.636 --> 00:24:06.508
Let me look at this guy, man.
He's kind of...


402
00:24:06.552 --> 00:24:09.990
The eye is
the window to the souls.


403
00:24:10.033 --> 00:24:11.905
Goran: With this production,
it's always the same thing.


404
00:24:11.948 --> 00:24:13.776
I get there. It's a nightmare.

405
00:24:13.820 --> 00:24:16.866
Yeah. I can see
some potential in this guy.


406
00:24:16.910 --> 00:24:18.215
I like him.

407
00:24:18.259 --> 00:24:19.478
Goran: You know, no one listens.

408
00:24:19.521 --> 00:24:22.045
That's not how you direct, man.

409
00:24:22.089 --> 00:24:24.091
Gracias, seÃ±ora.

410
00:24:25.440 --> 00:24:28.182
Nice box. Hey.

411
00:24:28.225 --> 00:24:30.053
Okay, amigos.

412
00:24:30.097 --> 00:24:31.925
We going to celebrate
the new chapter


413
00:24:31.968 --> 00:24:33.187
in the Punta Brothers.

414
00:24:33.230 --> 00:24:34.710
- Salud.
- Salud.


415
00:24:34.754 --> 00:24:36.407
- Goran: Salud, guys.
- Salud. Salud.


416
00:24:36.451 --> 00:24:39.106
They think I'm stupid,
but I know what I'm doing here.


417
00:24:45.155 --> 00:24:47.114
Rinaldo: I'm still in
a hangover type of thing.


418
00:24:47.157 --> 00:24:49.856
You know,
that wasn't really me.


419
00:24:49.899 --> 00:24:52.380
I'm serious about this project.

420
00:24:52.423 --> 00:24:53.599
Mitch: Rinaldo has a passion
for what he's doing,


421
00:24:53.642 --> 00:24:54.948
but if it doesn't work out,

422
00:24:54.991 --> 00:24:56.863
then maybe
I'll do my own screenplay.


423
00:24:56.906 --> 00:24:58.995
Maybe I'll
take over the acting,


424
00:24:59.039 --> 00:25:00.736
because I really love
the acting.


425
00:25:00.780 --> 00:25:03.173
Goran: It's going to take me
hours to get to location.


426
00:25:03.217 --> 00:25:04.435
I don't know where they are,

427
00:25:04.479 --> 00:25:07.569
and I'm in no hurry,
like I told you.


428
00:25:07.613 --> 00:25:11.138
And I'm dreading it, frankly.
These people are out of control.


429
00:25:11.181 --> 00:25:13.444
The last couple of times

430
00:25:13.488 --> 00:25:17.013
I tried to direct
with these people,


431
00:25:17.057 --> 00:25:18.580
it was a nightmare.

432
00:25:18.624 --> 00:25:20.974
I almost changed profession.

433
00:25:22.932 --> 00:25:24.934
You know, this is
always a mystery to me.


434
00:25:38.948 --> 00:25:41.168
Mitch: I went by
the villa, and no one's there.


435
00:25:41.211 --> 00:25:43.431
Can't get in.

436
00:25:43.474 --> 00:25:45.955
So, I thought I'd just go to
a local cafeteria,


437
00:25:45.999 --> 00:25:48.436
N + A Cafeteria
around the corner,


438
00:25:48.479 --> 00:25:51.874
just to get in
Cuban sort of culture.


439
00:25:51.918 --> 00:25:54.137
And again, it's a great
opportunity to write,


440
00:25:54.181 --> 00:25:56.139
and I'm excited.

441
00:25:58.141 --> 00:25:59.578
Goran: You know, these
guys are a little better


442
00:25:59.621 --> 00:26:00.796
than the last batch.

443
00:26:00.840 --> 00:26:04.452
Rinaldo, he's a natural.

444
00:26:04.495 --> 00:26:07.498
If I had a restaurant,
he'd be working in my kitchen.


445
00:26:08.674 --> 00:26:11.198
Rinaldo:
Don Punta is my idea, man.


446
00:26:11.241 --> 00:26:14.027
If nobody agree with that,
fuck it.


447
00:26:14.070 --> 00:26:17.987
If they don't like the script,
I rip the whole thing.


448
00:26:18.031 --> 00:26:20.511
I use it for toilet paper.
So what?


449
00:26:20.555 --> 00:26:22.992
Fuck.

450
00:26:25.691 --> 00:26:27.997
Mitch:
This reminds me of Hemingway,


451
00:26:28.041 --> 00:26:29.303
his classic book
I read in high school,


452
00:26:29.346 --> 00:26:30.783
Old Man and the Sea.

453
00:26:30.826 --> 00:26:33.437
No jokes here, guys.
I still feel young.


454
00:26:33.481 --> 00:26:36.136
Wow.

455
00:26:49.932 --> 00:26:53.109
Goran: If you look at
the sequence of events,


456
00:26:53.153 --> 00:26:56.852
I show up
for a production meeting,


457
00:26:56.896 --> 00:26:58.201
and this guy's got

458
00:26:58.245 --> 00:27:00.813
women all over the place,
dancing.


459
00:27:00.856 --> 00:27:05.034
And I'm fully expecting
maybe a staff meeting.


460
00:27:05.078 --> 00:27:07.689
Instead, I've got these
beautiful women dancing around.


461
00:27:07.733 --> 00:27:10.910
I mean,
it was really bizarre.


462
00:27:10.953 --> 00:27:13.347
You know, I was assured
maybe this time it'll work.


463
00:27:13.390 --> 00:27:14.740
It'll be more professional.

464
00:27:16.132 --> 00:27:18.439
Mitch? He's something else, too.

465
00:27:18.482 --> 00:27:22.573
I mean, he's supposed
to be, like, an executive.


466
00:27:22.617 --> 00:27:24.706
He was very serious,
but soon as he saw the girls,


467
00:27:24.750 --> 00:27:27.056
he totally abandoned me.

468
00:27:27.100 --> 00:27:30.799
He's originally
a hotshot lawyer,


469
00:27:30.843 --> 00:27:32.845
and he's right in there
in the thick of things,


470
00:27:32.888 --> 00:27:34.411
dancing like--

471
00:27:34.455 --> 00:27:36.631
He's a pretty good dancer,
actually.


472
00:27:36.675 --> 00:27:38.111
It's unbelievable.

473
00:27:38.154 --> 00:27:39.765
I've never seen anything
like it, but you know,


474
00:27:39.808 --> 00:27:42.463
now, I can say I've
seen everything in production.


475
00:27:45.553 --> 00:27:47.642
I'm going to say, yeah,
that guy Don Punta,


476
00:27:47.686 --> 00:27:50.863
he's a real loose cannon,
this guy.


477
00:27:50.906 --> 00:27:52.386
You know, he's out of control.

478
00:27:52.429 --> 00:27:54.127
You don't know what
he's going to do next.


479
00:27:54.170 --> 00:27:57.608
This guy's swallowing cocaine,
just completely oblivious


480
00:27:57.652 --> 00:28:01.047
to what we're supposed
to be doing, you know?


481
00:28:01.090 --> 00:28:05.007
And I even went so far as
to block the script


482
00:28:05.051 --> 00:28:07.531
while they were partying.
I went through it.


483
00:28:07.575 --> 00:28:11.361
I came up with new ideas,
and it was all for nothing.


484
00:28:13.102 --> 00:28:16.889
I came on to this production
thinking that, uh,


485
00:28:16.932 --> 00:28:19.195
maybe I was going to do
something unique.


486
00:28:19.239 --> 00:28:20.588
It was a reality show.

487
00:28:20.631 --> 00:28:22.808
I guess that's the nature

488
00:28:22.851 --> 00:28:24.679
of this specific production,
anyway.


489
00:28:25.680 --> 00:28:26.942
Thinking about production,

490
00:28:26.986 --> 00:28:31.381
I can sort of compare it

491
00:28:31.425 --> 00:28:35.559
to Orson Welles's last project.

492
00:28:35.603 --> 00:28:37.083
You know, that psychedelic
thing he did,


493
00:28:37.126 --> 00:28:38.388
The Other Side of the Wind.

494
00:28:38.432 --> 00:28:40.173
That's what it reminds me of.

495
00:28:40.216 --> 00:28:44.307
Same type of chaos

496
00:28:44.351 --> 00:28:47.267
and smorgasbord
of actors and characters.


497
00:28:47.310 --> 00:28:50.009
You know, I mean, you get
an idea of what it was like


498
00:28:50.052 --> 00:28:52.011
being in that production.

499
00:28:52.054 --> 00:28:54.578
But you got to
give this guy credit.


500
00:28:54.622 --> 00:28:57.799
This is some interesting stuff,
interesting characters.


501
00:29:02.064 --> 00:29:05.633
Nothing can surprise me
after this.


502
00:29:16.905 --> 00:29:19.473
These Mickey Mouse actor,

503
00:29:19.516 --> 00:29:22.737
let's see who they are,
who they really are.


504
00:29:22.781 --> 00:29:24.304
How are you this morning?

505
00:29:24.347 --> 00:29:25.609
Well, we're having
a little controversy here.


506
00:29:25.653 --> 00:29:27.263
Long night?

507
00:29:27.307 --> 00:29:29.570
You're a little late
for this meeting, aren't you?


508
00:29:29.613 --> 00:29:32.486
I have an idea why you're late.

509
00:29:32.529 --> 00:29:34.880
Yeah? Well, I was working on
the script all night.


510
00:29:34.923 --> 00:29:36.142
Really? A script?

511
00:29:36.185 --> 00:29:38.013
No shit.

512
00:29:38.057 --> 00:29:39.885
You're going to really like
this. I think you guys--


513
00:29:39.928 --> 00:29:42.365
Rinaldo: Well, I know exactly
what you were doing last night,


514
00:29:42.409 --> 00:29:45.673
down here and everything.

515
00:29:45.716 --> 00:29:48.328
Maricon told me.

516
00:29:48.371 --> 00:29:49.982
- I'm the maricon who told him.
- Goran: Are you the maricon?


517
00:29:50.025 --> 00:29:51.679
I hate that name.

518
00:29:51.722 --> 00:29:53.637
I'd rather have Meyer, frankly.
But whatever. Go ahead.


519
00:29:53.681 --> 00:29:55.204
Meyer? Like Meyer Lansky?

520
00:29:55.248 --> 00:29:56.858
Mitch: Meyer Lansky.
I think that's very Spanish.


521
00:29:56.902 --> 00:30:00.644
You know, Mitch told me
how loyal you are to me, man.


522
00:30:00.688 --> 00:30:03.169
You were sleeping with my girl.

523
00:30:03.212 --> 00:30:07.216
So the two girls that were here,
they weren't with you?


524
00:30:07.260 --> 00:30:09.740
Oh, you're pretending not
to know anything about it, eh?


525
00:30:09.784 --> 00:30:13.005
Listen, uh, Don Punta,

526
00:30:13.048 --> 00:30:14.397
I'm really trying my hardest

527
00:30:14.441 --> 00:30:16.051
to stay on board
this production.


528
00:30:16.095 --> 00:30:18.532
I mean, first of all,
the script is horrifying.


529
00:30:18.575 --> 00:30:20.316
Rinaldo: If you only knew
what happened in Miami,


530
00:30:20.360 --> 00:30:22.753
you wouldn't be acting
like these guys, you know?


531
00:30:22.797 --> 00:30:24.320
I got rid of
a couple guys there,


532
00:30:24.364 --> 00:30:26.409
Just like this, all right?
[snapping fingers]


533
00:30:26.453 --> 00:30:29.760
So please, stay with me.
Be loyal to me.


534
00:30:29.804 --> 00:30:32.502
You treat me good,
I treat you better.


535
00:30:32.546 --> 00:30:36.419
I'm going to hire you the
best bitches here for you, man.


536
00:30:36.463 --> 00:30:39.683
You can choose.
And the maricon for you, okay?


537
00:30:39.727 --> 00:30:41.250
Not okay. It's all right.

538
00:30:41.294 --> 00:30:44.514
Rinaldo: So you all going
to be happy, all right?


539
00:30:44.558 --> 00:30:46.560
Is that okay? Clear? All good?

540
00:30:46.603 --> 00:30:47.866
- Okay.
- I like that.


541
00:31:01.749 --> 00:31:04.883
I actually ran into him
at the Nacional.


542
00:31:04.926 --> 00:31:06.885
- Are you serious?
- Yes.


543
00:31:06.928 --> 00:31:08.190
He's at the Nacional?

544
00:31:08.234 --> 00:31:09.452
Well, he was telling me
the place


545
00:31:09.496 --> 00:31:11.019
was a fucking piece-of-shit hole

546
00:31:11.063 --> 00:31:12.716
and he wanted to
get the hell out.


547
00:31:12.760 --> 00:31:14.240
That sounds like Rick.

548
00:31:14.283 --> 00:31:16.633
- It does sound like Rick.
- Wow.


549
00:31:16.677 --> 00:31:20.986
Well, this is my shirt.
This is great.


550
00:31:21.029 --> 00:31:23.292
Okay.
This is a Croatian shirt,


551
00:31:23.336 --> 00:31:24.946
my favourite Croatian shirt.
Okay.


552
00:31:24.990 --> 00:31:27.470
I'm going to try to find him.
He's at this Nacional.


553
00:31:27.514 --> 00:31:32.040
And wouldn't it be wonderful
that I reunite with Rick


554
00:31:32.084 --> 00:31:35.261
and the two of us
will ride off into the sunset


555
00:31:35.304 --> 00:31:39.743
underneath this
great tunnel here in Cuba?


556
00:31:56.760 --> 00:32:01.026
[man singing in Spanish]

he's doing all this blow and...

[inhaling]

Oh, man. [groaning]

562
00:32:30.751 --> 00:32:33.232
I just wanted to,
you know, call you outside.


563
00:32:33.275 --> 00:32:35.103
I want you to keep an eye
on those guys, all right?


564
00:32:35.147 --> 00:32:36.800
I will. I will.
Let's see how they do.


565
00:32:36.844 --> 00:32:39.847
Let's see how this
progresses in preproduction.


566
00:32:39.890 --> 00:32:41.414
- Ah.
- Here you go, buddy.


567
00:32:41.457 --> 00:32:43.416
You read my mind, man.

568
00:32:43.459 --> 00:32:45.374
- Thank you. Thank you.
- Jeez, man.


569
00:32:45.418 --> 00:32:47.028
- It's painful to watch.
- Thank you, man.


570
00:32:47.072 --> 00:32:48.812
I'm starting to sweat
watching you.


571
00:32:48.856 --> 00:32:50.162
A lot of residue here, man.

572
00:32:50.205 --> 00:32:51.728
A lot of shit
is still sticking there.


573
00:32:51.772 --> 00:32:54.601
You know what I mean, eh?

574
00:32:54.644 --> 00:32:56.733
Probably is getting back
in my-- all the way here.


575
00:32:56.777 --> 00:32:58.561
[sniffing]

576
00:32:58.605 --> 00:33:00.433
Can you see any shit here?
No. Really? No?


577
00:33:00.476 --> 00:33:01.695
Goran: There's a little bit
of shit there, yeah.


578
00:33:01.738 --> 00:33:03.784
Really? No. That's maybe...

579
00:33:03.827 --> 00:33:06.395
[blowing nose]

580
00:33:06.439 --> 00:33:10.312
Never seen that, ever,
in any production.


581
00:33:10.356 --> 00:33:12.053
So, I mean, it's the first.

582
00:33:12.097 --> 00:33:13.837
A lot of things
are a first here.


583
00:33:13.881 --> 00:33:17.885
That's nothing, man. I've got
unlimited, you know, supply.


584
00:33:17.928 --> 00:33:20.975
So, you know,
we're all good here.


585
00:33:21.019 --> 00:33:24.065
By the way, Goran,
you have to loosen up, man.


586
00:33:24.109 --> 00:33:27.329
I never see you dance, you know,
participate in the fun here.


587
00:33:27.373 --> 00:33:29.027
I want you to be part
of that fun, too.


588
00:33:29.070 --> 00:33:30.767
You can be too serious.

589
00:33:30.811 --> 00:33:35.120
Hey. Balance, man. Balance.
Fun is part of the business.


590
00:33:35.163 --> 00:33:38.079
And at the end,
I'm going to treat you, man.


591
00:33:38.123 --> 00:33:39.689
I'm going to treat you well,
all right?


592
00:33:39.733 --> 00:33:40.995
Goran: I'd like to see
how we get to that point.


593
00:33:41.039 --> 00:33:42.518
- Okay.
- Goran: But I appreciate it.


594
00:33:42.562 --> 00:33:44.172
- Beautiful, man.
- Goran: Thanks, brother.


595
00:33:44.216 --> 00:33:45.434
I'm counting on you, all right?

596
00:33:45.478 --> 00:33:46.696
- Yeah.
- Rinaldo: I really are.


597
00:33:46.740 --> 00:33:48.176
- Okay.
- Rinaldo: Bye.

Rick? It can't be Rick. No.

Rick? No. No.
Why aren't you answering me?

Rick. It's not Rick.

even started shooting.

I mean, you're really mocking
that stuff up pretty much.

- You okay?
- I'm perfectly fine.

Where are these guys, man?

612
00:38:07.783 --> 00:38:09.394
Supposed to be here
for this meeting.


613
00:38:09.437 --> 00:38:11.439
Guys? Hey.

614
00:38:13.833 --> 00:38:16.009
There you are.

615
00:38:16.052 --> 00:38:17.619
Goran:
We thought of this logically.


616
00:38:17.663 --> 00:38:19.752
Like, if we looked at it--

617
00:38:19.795 --> 00:38:21.362
Rinaldo:
Hold on. Hold on.


618
00:38:21.406 --> 00:38:22.842
One thing at a time, all right?

619
00:38:22.885 --> 00:38:25.366
Would you like some stuff
right here?


620
00:38:25.410 --> 00:38:27.107
No, no, no. No, thank you.

621
00:38:27.150 --> 00:38:30.545
So, you-- Should I--
Do you want me to continue here?


622
00:38:30.589 --> 00:38:31.807
Go on, man.

623
00:38:31.851 --> 00:38:34.419
Goran:
All right.


624
00:38:34.462 --> 00:38:36.246
So, I figure
this exterior scene here,


625
00:38:36.290 --> 00:38:37.726
this is my main concern.

626
00:38:37.770 --> 00:38:41.121
Rinaldo: Where is
my fucking cigar, man?


627
00:38:45.386 --> 00:38:47.910
See? No cut it. 
But it's fine.

628
00:38:47.954 --> 00:38:49.651
We can survive.

629
00:38:49.695 --> 00:38:52.132
Goran: Okay. So, look.

630
00:38:52.175 --> 00:38:53.873
- Yeah. You were saying?
- Yeah.


631
00:38:53.916 --> 00:38:55.353
Rinaldo:
But wait a minute.


632
00:38:55.396 --> 00:38:57.355
I need a blast, man.

633
00:38:58.443 --> 00:39:01.054
[exhaling]

634
00:39:01.097 --> 00:39:04.710
Goran: So, we do
have five exteriors here,


635
00:39:04.753 --> 00:39:06.451
and I don't know if, uh...

636
00:39:07.713 --> 00:39:08.931
[coughing]

637
00:39:08.975 --> 00:39:10.977
...if, uh... Ugh.

638
00:39:12.457 --> 00:39:14.110
Rinaldo:
This is so good, man.


639
00:39:14.154 --> 00:39:15.677
- This is magic.
- Yeah.


640
00:39:15.721 --> 00:39:18.071
You should get
some of this shit, man.


641
00:39:18.114 --> 00:39:19.681
Yeah. I just got some
on my pants. Listen.


642
00:39:19.725 --> 00:39:21.335
Rinaldo:
This is like a blessing, man.


643
00:39:21.379 --> 00:39:22.902
Goran:
We got a clear three-act--


644
00:39:22.945 --> 00:39:24.294
Give me the script.
Give me the script. Come on.


645
00:39:24.338 --> 00:39:25.861
- Give me that shit.
- Are you--


646
00:39:25.905 --> 00:39:27.559
Rinaldo:
Come on. Come on. Come on.


647
00:39:27.602 --> 00:39:30.039
Goran:
There you go. There's your--


648
00:39:30.083 --> 00:39:31.911
Rinaldo:
Fuck. This--


649
00:39:31.954 --> 00:39:34.392
- Goran: Rinaldo!
- This is garbage, man.


650
00:39:34.435 --> 00:39:38.091
It's no good anymore.
Your funny shit is garbage.


651
00:39:38.134 --> 00:39:41.964
It all change.
Change of course, plan.


652
00:39:42.008 --> 00:39:45.011
Everything is--
You know, start from scratch.


653
00:39:45.054 --> 00:39:48.710
[inhaling]

654
00:39:50.016 --> 00:39:51.974
Oh, fuck, man.

655
00:39:52.018 --> 00:39:56.544
My friend, maybe you'd better
go easy on the, uh, cocaine.


656
00:39:56.588 --> 00:39:57.806
There's something--
You're bleeding.


657
00:39:57.850 --> 00:39:58.981
What are you talking about, man?

658
00:39:59.025 --> 00:40:00.156
Goran:
You got blood all over.


659
00:40:00.200 --> 00:40:01.288
What are you talking about?

660
00:40:01.331 --> 00:40:02.724
Take a look, man. 
You got blood.

661
00:40:03.856 --> 00:40:05.553
Whoa.

662
00:40:05.597 --> 00:40:09.688
Rinaldo: Now, let me just
do some more shit here, man.


663
00:40:09.731 --> 00:40:11.994
I really like the shit.

664
00:40:12.038 --> 00:40:14.736
[inhaling]

665
00:40:17.522 --> 00:40:21.134
- Fuck, man.
- Goran: Hey.


666
00:40:21.177 --> 00:40:23.397
Okay, guys. I think it's time

667
00:40:23.441 --> 00:40:25.617
for me to go and
take a dump, man.


668
00:40:25.660 --> 00:40:27.227
And then I come back.

669
00:40:27.270 --> 00:40:28.837
Where are you going?

670
00:40:28.881 --> 00:40:31.492
- Rinaldo: To take a dump, man.
- Oh.


671
00:40:31.536 --> 00:40:33.146
Rinaldo: You want to come
and clean my ass later on?


672
00:40:33.189 --> 00:40:34.452
I call you, all right?

673
00:40:47.900 --> 00:40:57.900
â™ª

674
00:41:06.092 --> 00:41:16.092
â™ª

675
00:41:54.662 --> 00:42:04.662
â™ª

676
00:43:10.695 --> 00:43:12.871
Rinaldo:
I have to call you, guy.


677
00:43:12.914 --> 00:43:15.134
It's going down, man.

678
00:43:17.876 --> 00:43:19.181
Hey, Doug.

679
00:43:19.225 --> 00:43:22.532
Doug, listen.
Yeah, yeah, it's me.


680
00:43:22.576 --> 00:43:26.711
And this character
called Rinaldo,


681
00:43:26.754 --> 00:43:29.017
who I thought was one of us
and was honest and everything,


682
00:43:29.061 --> 00:43:31.454
he screwed me.

683
00:43:31.498 --> 00:43:34.414
Everything is over, man.
It's over.


684
00:43:34.457 --> 00:43:37.896
What do I mean?
[laughing]


685
00:43:37.939 --> 00:43:39.593
It's over, man.

686
00:43:39.637 --> 00:43:41.595
No, no, no.
Don't put me in that.


687
00:43:41.639 --> 00:43:43.728
Like, now, I'm accused
of, like, taking all the money.


688
00:43:43.771 --> 00:43:46.861
Rinaldo:
Final day is here.


689
00:43:46.905 --> 00:43:49.385
So you should return the money.

690
00:43:49.429 --> 00:43:52.693
Do everything that is,
you know, good.


691
00:43:52.737 --> 00:43:54.869
So, we have to talk about this,

692
00:43:54.913 --> 00:43:57.132
because I spoke
to you about a week ago.


693
00:43:57.176 --> 00:43:59.395
Rinaldo:
I'm cleaning my conscience,


694
00:43:59.439 --> 00:44:00.788
and take care of it.

695
00:44:00.832 --> 00:44:02.747
Do the right thing,
at least for once.


696
00:44:02.790 --> 00:44:05.750
Okay? That's all I can say now.

697
00:44:05.793 --> 00:44:09.536
And I trusted him,
and he stabbed me in the back.


698
00:44:09.579 --> 00:44:11.843
And everybody thought
that he was such a nice guy,


699
00:44:11.886 --> 00:44:13.235
but I guess right now,

700
00:44:13.279 --> 00:44:15.585
we know that
he's not such a nice guy.


701
00:44:15.629 --> 00:44:20.112
So you won't hear from me
anymore, okay?


702
00:44:20.155 --> 00:44:23.158
Blanquita is better for me...
[laughing]


703
00:44:23.202 --> 00:44:25.160
...if you know what I mean,
right?


704
00:44:25.204 --> 00:44:28.424
I'll be seeing you
somewhere up there, man.


705
00:44:28.468 --> 00:44:32.254
You have your days counted
as well, so face it, man.


706
00:44:32.298 --> 00:44:34.866
You can run,
but you cannot hide.


707
00:44:34.909 --> 00:44:37.825
Hasta la vista, bitch.

708
00:44:37.869 --> 00:44:39.871
Fuck you.

709
00:44:39.914 --> 00:44:43.962
Hey? He hung up.

710
00:44:44.005 --> 00:44:46.225
You know? What the fuck?

711
00:44:46.268 --> 00:44:48.270
Fuck, man.

712
00:44:50.664 --> 00:44:52.231
[gasping]

713
00:44:53.885 --> 00:44:57.192
And there was a lot of death
in this show.


714
00:44:57.236 --> 00:44:59.934
I'm lucky that I'm still
sitting here, that I'm not dead.


715
00:44:59.978 --> 00:45:02.415
Goran, Goran!

716
00:45:02.458 --> 00:45:05.592
Hey, Mitch.
Where are you guys?


717
00:45:05.635 --> 00:45:09.248
Mitch... Man, man.

718
00:45:09.291 --> 00:45:12.251
Anybody around?
Where is everybody, man?


719
00:45:12.294 --> 00:45:14.427
Where is everybody? Fuck.

720
00:45:14.470 --> 00:45:16.603
My final message
to you, Rinaldo?


721
00:45:16.646 --> 00:45:19.345
We've got a fix
on your cellphone,


722
00:45:19.388 --> 00:45:21.390
so I know where you are.

723
00:45:21.434 --> 00:45:24.654
I know that compound
where you are.


724
00:45:24.698 --> 00:45:26.439
Because I'm coming,

725
00:45:26.482 --> 00:45:29.181
and it's going to be like
George Bush and shock and awe.


726
00:45:29.224 --> 00:45:30.704
We're coming down.

727
00:45:30.748 --> 00:45:33.272
We're going to get you,
and there's no escape.


728
00:45:33.315 --> 00:45:38.277
Where is the fucking
everybody, man?


729
00:45:38.320 --> 00:45:40.888
Where is everybody?

730
00:45:40.932 --> 00:45:43.369
And I don't care if you're Don,
Rinaldo, Punta, or Escobar.


731
00:45:43.412 --> 00:45:45.545
All four of you,
we're going to get you.


732
00:45:45.588 --> 00:45:48.591
[moaning]

733
00:45:48.635 --> 00:45:51.029
Not even a fucking bitch
around, man.


734
00:46:09.830 --> 00:46:19.797
â™ª

735
00:46:27.108 --> 00:46:37.108
â™ª

736
00:47:39.964 --> 00:47:49.930
â™ª

737
00:48:28.316 --> 00:48:30.318
[coughing]

738
00:48:35.019 --> 00:48:37.108
Fuck, man.

739
00:48:37.151 --> 00:48:38.892
Fuck, man!

740
00:48:38.936 --> 00:48:41.068
[shouting incoherently]

741
00:48:41.112 --> 00:48:43.592
â™ª So fine and so gentle

742
00:48:46.030 --> 00:48:49.598
â™ª I came around

743
00:48:49.642 --> 00:48:53.167
â™ª And now I see

744
00:48:53.211 --> 00:48:55.778
â™ª Your face

745
00:48:55.822 --> 00:48:58.956
â™ª So sentimentally

746
00:49:02.698 --> 00:49:04.091
What, are you guys filming this?
What the--


747
00:49:04.135 --> 00:49:06.180
Hey, dude. You okay?

748
00:49:08.704 --> 00:49:10.184
What are you guys doing?
Let's go.


749
00:49:10.228 --> 00:49:12.230
Call 911.

750
00:49:12.273 --> 00:49:15.146
Jesus Christ, man.
Get the fucking ambulance.


751
00:49:15.189 --> 00:49:17.931
What are you guys doing?

752
00:49:17.975 --> 00:49:21.282
â™ª Angels call your name

753
00:49:21.326 --> 00:49:24.807
â™ª They do sing to me

754
00:49:26.635 --> 00:49:28.768
He's done, man. He's gone.

755
00:49:28.811 --> 00:49:30.944
Give him mouth-to-mouth, Mitch.

756
00:49:30.988 --> 00:49:32.380
- Are you serious?
- Yeah, I'm serious, man.


757
00:49:32.424 --> 00:49:33.686
Why you think I called you?

758
00:49:40.823 --> 00:49:43.522
Mitch: There's no pulse.
This was not supposed to happen.


759
00:49:43.565 --> 00:49:46.307
Goran: No. He must have took
just one big hit and went down.


760
00:49:46.351 --> 00:49:47.656
Mitch: We have to
make funeral arrangements.


761
00:49:47.700 --> 00:49:51.443
We have to call
his relatives or--


762
00:49:51.486 --> 00:49:54.185
You better get that coke off
your nose before the cops come.


763
00:49:54.228 --> 00:49:55.708
- I appreciate it.
- Get cleaned up.


764
00:49:55.751 --> 00:49:57.362
Well, I was trying
to help him out.


765
00:49:57.405 --> 00:49:59.538
Let's get Malik. Stand vigil
by the body, will you?


766
00:49:59.581 --> 00:50:00.800
Where is he?

767
00:50:00.843 --> 00:50:03.063
We need someone
to stand vigil here.


768
00:50:03.107 --> 00:50:07.589
Oh, I...I kind of...

769
00:50:07.633 --> 00:50:09.330
You know, I've been
through a lot with Rinaldo.


770
00:50:09.374 --> 00:50:11.419
I knew him
when he was just a doorman


771
00:50:11.463 --> 00:50:16.381
and then an aspiring filmmaker
and aspiring drug lord.


772
00:50:16.424 --> 00:50:18.992
And now, he's gone,

773
00:50:19.036 --> 00:50:21.734
and I think he'll be missed.

774
00:50:21.777 --> 00:50:24.389
But he'll be remembered.

775
00:50:24.432 --> 00:50:27.131
I'm not sure exactly for what,
but he will be remembered.


776
00:50:27.174 --> 00:50:29.263
â™ª To me and now

777
00:50:32.266 --> 00:50:35.226
â™ª I feel so thankfully

778
00:50:35.269 --> 00:50:37.706
â™ª That you have been
so good to me â™ª


779
00:50:37.750 --> 00:50:39.230
Mitch: I don't drink,
and I don't smoke.


780
00:50:39.273 --> 00:50:43.190
But I'm, you know,
shaking a little bit here. Okay.


781
00:50:43.234 --> 00:50:45.105
Well, guess what?
You're going to fucking drink,


782
00:50:45.149 --> 00:50:46.933
and you're going to smoke.

783
00:50:46.976 --> 00:50:49.066
Okay? You're at my table,
and you can't just sit there...


784
00:50:49.109 --> 00:50:50.806
- This is your table?
- ...like a dick, looking at me.


785
00:50:50.850 --> 00:50:52.634
Okay. But Wally--

786
00:50:52.678 --> 00:50:55.333
You got to drink some poison.
I don't want to drink this shit,


787
00:50:55.376 --> 00:50:56.638
but for you, it's okay.

788
00:50:56.682 --> 00:50:58.249
Okay.

789
00:50:58.292 --> 00:51:00.729
- L'chaim, my friend.
- Wally: Salud, boys.


790
00:51:00.773 --> 00:51:01.991
Mitch:
Oh, this is horrible.


791
00:51:02.035 --> 00:51:03.863
It is poison. Okay.

792
00:51:03.906 --> 00:51:06.039
- I don't smoke.
- Neither do I.


793
00:51:06.083 --> 00:51:07.780
- Okay.
- But it's this production.


794
00:51:07.823 --> 00:51:09.260
Okay. Here goes.

795
00:51:09.303 --> 00:51:11.610
You got to put it
in your mouth to light it.


796
00:51:11.653 --> 00:51:13.655
You can't fucking
just put the cigarette out.


797
00:51:18.225 --> 00:51:19.879
Hey, it's not bad.

798
00:51:19.922 --> 00:51:21.272
First time for everything.

799
00:51:21.315 --> 00:51:22.577
Mitch: There's a first time
for everything.


800
00:51:37.462 --> 00:51:40.204
Mitch: Malik,
I'm sorry it didn't work out.


801
00:51:40.247 --> 00:51:41.814
You know,
I was hoping you'd be an actor


802
00:51:41.857 --> 00:51:44.121
and, you know,
a major star in this project.


803
00:51:44.164 --> 00:51:47.167
But you know, it was out of
my control. I'm sorry.


804
00:51:47.211 --> 00:51:50.953
Okay. It just sucks that
it has to go down like this.


805
00:51:50.997 --> 00:51:52.825
I don't know
if he was really aware


806
00:51:52.868 --> 00:51:54.653
of his function in this film.

807
00:51:54.696 --> 00:51:56.524
He was the host.

808
00:51:56.568 --> 00:51:59.179
I don't know what that means.

809
00:51:59.223 --> 00:52:02.139
I'm sorry you didn't
get to meet Rick.


810
00:52:02.182 --> 00:52:04.315
Unfortunately.
His story is very inspiring.


811
00:52:04.358 --> 00:52:05.751
Mitch:
It is.


812
00:52:05.794 --> 00:52:07.013
I heard he's the type of guy

813
00:52:07.056 --> 00:52:08.841
that'll give you
the shirt off his back.


814
00:52:08.884 --> 00:52:12.888
Oh. Well, actually,
he actually did.


815
00:52:21.897 --> 00:52:23.464
Okay. Let me now address

816
00:52:23.508 --> 00:52:24.857
what's happened
the last three or four days.


817
00:52:24.900 --> 00:52:26.815
I was at this villa,

818
00:52:26.859 --> 00:52:28.513
and a lot of strange
things were happening.


819
00:52:28.556 --> 00:52:29.862
And I'm now, again,
piecing together.


820
00:52:29.905 --> 00:52:32.169
I mean, it's all coming at me,

821
00:52:32.212 --> 00:52:34.693
so stick with me.

822
00:52:42.353 --> 00:52:44.920
So, you thought
this Rick didn't exist.


823
00:52:44.964 --> 00:52:46.226
Goran:
Well, you know what?


824
00:52:46.270 --> 00:52:47.662
When I see it, 
I'll believe it.

825
00:52:47.706 --> 00:52:49.403
I mean, it's like I said.

826
00:52:49.447 --> 00:52:52.145
It's unlike anything
I've ever worked on.


827
00:52:52.189 --> 00:52:53.364
Mitch: Well, he is--
What's the expression?


828
00:52:53.407 --> 00:52:54.452
I'm not sure, but to paraphrase,

829
00:52:54.495 --> 00:52:56.802
he's, like, inscrutable.

830
00:52:56.845 --> 00:53:00.240
He's a riddle wrapped in a
mystery wrapped in a conundrum.


831
00:53:00.284 --> 00:53:01.981
Well, look.

832
00:53:02.024 --> 00:53:03.852
I mean, bottom line is,
we've been had.


833
00:53:03.896 --> 00:53:05.680
He's been pulling
the strings all along,


834
00:53:05.724 --> 00:53:08.248
and this is what
I find fascinating.


835
00:53:08.292 --> 00:53:09.771
You're telling me it was him

836
00:53:09.815 --> 00:53:11.469
who pulled the strings
for us to get here?


837
00:53:11.512 --> 00:53:13.732
It was.

838
00:53:13.775 --> 00:53:15.473
Goran: We're here in Cuba.
It wasn't you who--


839
00:53:15.516 --> 00:53:16.735
It wasn't me. No.

840
00:53:16.778 --> 00:53:18.824
He even pulled one over you.

841
00:53:18.867 --> 00:53:20.956
I'm sure he's pulled
more than one over me,


842
00:53:21.000 --> 00:53:22.262
but I believe in him,

843
00:53:22.306 --> 00:53:24.743
because he is a guy
with a vision.


844
00:53:24.786 --> 00:53:26.266
He's passionate,

845
00:53:26.310 --> 00:53:28.877
and whatever
he puts his mind to happens.


846
00:53:28.921 --> 00:53:30.966
And this is happening.

847
00:53:31.010 --> 00:53:34.143
What is it?
Rinaldo and Mitch--


848
00:53:34.187 --> 00:53:36.624
- Okay.
- Producer: Yeah.


849
00:53:36.668 --> 00:53:38.278
- One or two seconds.
- Goran: Yeah, you got it.


850
00:53:38.322 --> 00:53:40.280
Mitch: Yeah.
Okay. Let's go.


851
00:53:40.324 --> 00:53:41.803
Goran: I don't even believe
he's here, if he exists, man.


852
00:53:41.847 --> 00:53:43.240
He does exist. Okay.

853
00:53:43.283 --> 00:53:44.284
You guys are getting on my
nerves, man.


854
00:53:44.328 --> 00:53:45.503
What's up with this?

855
00:53:45.546 --> 00:53:46.939
He was supposed to
get us a permit.


856
00:53:46.982 --> 00:53:48.070
You know,
this is a very popular hotel.


857
00:53:48.114 --> 00:53:49.289
You bring me out
all the way here


858
00:53:49.333 --> 00:53:50.551
and you tell me
we're about to meet him.


859
00:53:50.595 --> 00:53:52.031
and they kick us out of there.

860
00:53:52.074 --> 00:53:53.902
Why? Because
there's some cameras with us?


861
00:53:53.946 --> 00:53:55.426
Let's get us a mojito. I'm sorry
to waste your time, my friend.


862
00:53:55.469 --> 00:53:57.341
- Let's get a mojito, man.
- Okay.


863
00:53:57.384 --> 00:53:59.081
This is getting
slightly painful.


864
00:53:59.125 --> 00:54:00.474
- Mitch: All right.
- Goran: Let's go.


865
00:54:07.481 --> 00:54:10.354
Mitch:
And wouldn't it be wonderful


866
00:54:10.397 --> 00:54:15.272
if I reunite with Rick
here in Cuba,


867
00:54:15.315 --> 00:54:18.666
and the two of us will
ride off into the sunset


868
00:54:18.710 --> 00:54:22.627
underneath this great tunnel?

869
00:54:44.388 --> 00:54:45.867
Goran:
Let me ask you something.


870
00:54:45.911 --> 00:54:47.347
Mitch:
Go ahead.


871
00:54:47.391 --> 00:54:50.307
Goran: This individual Rick,
that we're...


872
00:54:50.350 --> 00:54:53.875
- Yes.
- ...about to meet...


873
00:54:53.919 --> 00:54:55.312
What do you want to know
about him?


874
00:54:55.355 --> 00:54:57.879
Well, what I want to know is--

875
00:54:57.923 --> 00:54:59.185
I heard that he's difficult.

876
00:54:59.228 --> 00:55:01.230
Mitch:
Well, I disagree.


877
00:55:01.274 --> 00:55:02.667
I've known him for many years.

878
00:55:02.710 --> 00:55:07.193
He's a warm, compassionate guy,
really smart.


879
00:55:07.236 --> 00:55:09.369
He gets stuff done.

880
00:55:09.413 --> 00:55:11.458
Whatever it takes, he gets it
done.


881
00:55:11.502 --> 00:55:16.115
And he just has
done it his own way.


882
00:55:16.158 --> 00:55:17.508
He just breaks all the rules.

883
00:55:17.551 --> 00:55:18.813
He's like an entrepreneur,
in a sense.


884
00:55:18.857 --> 00:55:19.901
Very entrepreneur.
Like, forget--


885
00:55:19.945 --> 00:55:21.381
Goran:
Revolutionary.


886
00:55:21.425 --> 00:55:22.991
Mitch: Revolutionary.
I mean, you know--


887
00:55:23.035 --> 00:55:24.602
Goran:
I'm excited to meet this guy.


888
00:55:24.645 --> 00:55:28.388
I'm sure he's been watching us,
keeping tabs.


889
00:55:28.432 --> 00:55:32.218
I always sensed his presence,
but I didn't think it was here.


890
00:55:32.261 --> 00:55:34.655
But Wally confirmed he was here.

891
00:55:34.699 --> 00:55:36.788
This, in fact, is
a perfect time to meet him,


892
00:55:36.831 --> 00:55:39.747
because he operates best
in chaos.


893
00:55:39.791 --> 00:55:41.270
- And there is chaos.
- Oh, yeah. Yeah.


894
00:55:41.314 --> 00:55:42.489
Obviously,
our lead actor is gone, right?


895
00:55:42.533 --> 00:55:44.099
You know what?
That makes sense.


896
00:55:44.143 --> 00:55:45.362
That seems like the type of
personality that he is.


897
00:55:45.405 --> 00:55:47.102
He loves chaos.

898
00:55:47.146 --> 00:55:48.887
Yeah. Well, you're about to
bring it full force here.


899
00:55:48.930 --> 00:55:50.236
Mitch:
We're going to bring it on.


900
00:55:50.279 --> 00:55:51.803
Goran:
I've never been on a production


901
00:55:51.846 --> 00:55:53.805
where the guy
intentionally killed himself.


902
00:55:56.764 --> 00:55:58.375
Yeah. I'm Rick.

903
00:55:58.418 --> 00:55:59.767
Goran:
Hey, man. Nice to meet you.


904
00:55:59.811 --> 00:56:01.639
I thought he was bullshitting.
Yeah.


905
00:56:01.682 --> 00:56:03.510
- It is Rick.
- Okay.


906
00:56:03.554 --> 00:56:05.556
Where do you want to go, there,
Hemingway? Look at this guy.


907
00:56:05.599 --> 00:56:06.948
[horn honking]

908
00:56:06.992 --> 00:56:09.864
Wow. All right.

909
00:56:09.908 --> 00:56:13.694
Let's follow him, man.
Where's he going?


910
00:56:13.738 --> 00:56:15.217
- That's Rick. Out of nowhere.
- What a coinci--


911
00:56:15.261 --> 00:56:16.828
This guy is tailing us,
I'll tell you.


912
00:56:16.871 --> 00:56:18.351
He came out of nowhere.
What did I say?


913
00:56:18.395 --> 00:56:20.397
Wow.

914
00:56:22.050 --> 00:56:23.443
Wow.

915
00:56:23.487 --> 00:56:26.533
Goran:
I didn't know he had a beard.


916
00:56:35.760 --> 00:56:36.978
Rick, come over here.
Come over here.


917
00:56:37.022 --> 00:56:38.806
What? What, Mitch?

918
00:56:38.850 --> 00:56:41.461
I called you over. Man, I got
some bad news. I got some bad--


919
00:56:41.505 --> 00:56:42.723
- Hold on.
- What? Mitch, relax.


920
00:56:42.767 --> 00:56:43.985
- I can't relax.
- Mitch. Mitch.


921
00:56:44.029 --> 00:56:45.247
Rinaldo. Rinaldo.

922
00:56:45.291 --> 00:56:46.640
I don't want to
hear about Rinaldo.


923
00:56:46.684 --> 00:56:48.337
- We're going home tomorrow.
- No, no--


924
00:56:48.381 --> 00:56:49.687
- Mitch, we're done.
- No, no.


925
00:56:49.730 --> 00:56:52.864
So, while all this
is coming down,


926
00:56:52.907 --> 00:56:55.388
I went to the one person
I thought I could trust.


927
00:56:55.432 --> 00:56:56.955
Are you sitting down?
You're standing up.


928
00:56:56.998 --> 00:56:58.565
Take it easy.

929
00:56:58.609 --> 00:57:00.480
- He's dead.
- He's not dead, Mitch.


930
00:57:00.524 --> 00:57:02.047
- He is dead.
- Mitch.


931
00:57:02.090 --> 00:57:03.309
- He is dead.
- Mitch--


932
00:57:03.352 --> 00:57:04.615
- We saw him die.
- Calm down.


933
00:57:04.658 --> 00:57:05.703
- He's dead.
- He died. You saw him.


934
00:57:05.746 --> 00:57:07.139
- No, Mitch.
- He died.


935
00:57:07.182 --> 00:57:08.401
- He's gone.
- They were all fake deaths


936
00:57:08.445 --> 00:57:10.011
- in the show.
- Goran: No.


937
00:57:10.055 --> 00:57:11.448
I know there were fake deaths,
and this was supposed--


938
00:57:11.491 --> 00:57:12.710
We were supposed to
film him drinking and--


939
00:57:12.753 --> 00:57:13.798
- Goran: Yeah.
- Rick: No.


940
00:57:13.841 --> 00:57:15.103
--snorting coke and everything.

941
00:57:15.147 --> 00:57:17.105
He's gone, sir. He's gone.

942
00:57:17.149 --> 00:57:18.846
- This is Goran, our director.
- Goran?


943
00:57:18.890 --> 00:57:20.369
- You've never met him.
- It's a pleasure to meet you.


944
00:57:20.413 --> 00:57:21.414
- Goran, Rick.
- I heard a lot about you.


945
00:57:21.458 --> 00:57:22.981
Rick, Goran. I'm sorry.

946
00:57:23.024 --> 00:57:25.287
It's too bad we met
under these circumstances.


947
00:57:25.331 --> 00:57:27.507
I have to conclude-- I mean,
now, it's coming together.


948
00:57:27.551 --> 00:57:29.944
And still, there's a lot of,
you know, moving pieces,


949
00:57:29.988 --> 00:57:32.860
but he's an evil genius,
this guy.


950
00:57:32.904 --> 00:57:35.123
He's got no pulse.
They pulled him out of there.


951
00:57:35.167 --> 00:57:37.474
- I tried to give him CPR.
- Yeah, that actor is out.


952
00:57:37.517 --> 00:57:38.910
Seriously.
I tried to give him CPR.


953
00:57:38.953 --> 00:57:40.346
Rick:
No, no, you didn't, Mitch.


954
00:57:40.389 --> 00:57:41.826
He blew his brains out
with that cocaine.


955
00:57:41.869 --> 00:57:43.175
This guy went ballistic.

956
00:57:43.218 --> 00:57:46.526
Mitch,
I don't know if Goran knows.


957
00:57:46.570 --> 00:57:48.615
The show's not real.

958
00:57:48.659 --> 00:57:50.704
He's not dead.

959
00:57:50.748 --> 00:57:54.229
I arranged the ambulance.
I arranged the fake cocaine.


960
00:57:54.273 --> 00:57:55.883
- Come on, man.
- It's flour.


961
00:57:55.927 --> 00:57:58.669
- Don't tell me that.
- Okay? I arranged everything.


962
00:57:58.712 --> 00:57:59.931
[Goran laughing]

963
00:57:59.974 --> 00:58:02.107
This is all off-script.

964
00:58:02.150 --> 00:58:03.369
He's not dead, Mitch.

965
00:58:03.412 --> 00:58:04.849
- Don't tell me that.
- Mitch.


966
00:58:04.892 --> 00:58:08.809
I now realize, I guess,
I was played.


967
00:58:08.853 --> 00:58:12.726
I was a mark.
These were all actors.


968
00:58:12.770 --> 00:58:13.988
- I gave him CPR.
- Mitch.


969
00:58:14.032 --> 00:58:15.250
I'm sure
he didn't have a pulse.


970
00:58:15.294 --> 00:58:16.730
- Mitch--
- He had no pulse.


971
00:58:16.774 --> 00:58:17.775
- No, no, no.
- How did you stop his pulse?


972
00:58:17.818 --> 00:58:19.167
We lowered his blood rate.

973
00:58:19.211 --> 00:58:20.778
Tell me
you're telling me the truth.


974
00:58:20.821 --> 00:58:22.606
- I'm telling you the truth.
- He checked his pulse.


975
00:58:22.649 --> 00:58:24.259
- No.
- I wasn't by myself.


976
00:58:24.303 --> 00:58:25.522
- Mitch, he's alive and well.
- He checked his pulse.


977
00:58:25.565 --> 00:58:27.001
I didn't check it properly.

978
00:58:27.045 --> 00:58:29.917
He's an actor.
He's an actor. You're an actor.


979
00:58:29.961 --> 00:58:31.266
He was an actor.

980
00:58:31.310 --> 00:58:33.138
No, he is an actor.
You're an actor.


981
00:58:33.181 --> 00:58:36.010
- He's dead.
- He's not dead.


982
00:58:36.054 --> 00:58:38.622
It turns out they were actors.

983
00:58:38.665 --> 00:58:42.451
They weren't playing actors.
They weren't playing themselves.


984
00:58:42.495 --> 00:58:46.151
They weren't playing, you know,
the doorman or the concierge.


985
00:58:46.194 --> 00:58:50.503
They were actors,
and I was completely deceived.


986
00:58:50.547 --> 00:58:52.070
[laughing]

987
00:58:52.113 --> 00:58:53.985
- This is part of the show?
- Yes.


988
00:58:54.028 --> 00:58:56.683
Well, congratulations.
[laughing]


989
00:58:56.727 --> 00:58:58.511
Mitch, it's not real.

990
00:58:58.555 --> 00:59:02.036
And I'm still trying to piece
together my role in this,


991
00:59:02.080 --> 00:59:03.385
Rinaldo's role in this.

992
00:59:03.429 --> 00:59:05.126
I'm questioning Doug's role
in this.


993
00:59:05.170 --> 00:59:06.650
It is very confusing.

994
00:59:06.693 --> 00:59:08.173
- Rick: Yes, Mitch.
- Hey, wake up, man.


995
00:59:08.216 --> 00:59:09.609
Don't be in shock still.
It's okay.


996
00:59:09.653 --> 00:59:10.915
- Rick: Mitch.
- I believe him.


997
00:59:10.958 --> 00:59:12.438
Rick:
How was Rinaldo's acting?


998
00:59:12.481 --> 00:59:13.918
Can we use this guy again?

999
00:59:13.961 --> 00:59:17.269
It seems chaotic,
but I think Rick does have


1000
00:59:17.312 --> 00:59:20.620
some sort of method
to his madness.


1001
00:59:20.664 --> 00:59:23.318
I think he was really rocked,
Rick.


1002
00:59:23.362 --> 00:59:24.711
Rick:
But it's okay.


1003
00:59:24.755 --> 00:59:25.973
He thought, really,
this guy passed.


1004
00:59:26.017 --> 00:59:27.627
Rick:
Mitch, you're my friend.


1005
00:59:27.671 --> 00:59:29.455
This is the cost
of doing business.


1006
00:59:29.498 --> 00:59:31.065
Jesus Christ, do I need a drink.

1007
00:59:31.109 --> 00:59:34.025
In retrospect, I should
have seen these red flags.


1008
00:59:40.031 --> 00:59:41.946
Mitch.

1009
00:59:41.989 --> 00:59:46.820
Man, if that ain't
the ultimate mind-fuck...


1010
00:59:46.864 --> 00:59:49.910
- I still can't process.
- I'm sor--


1011
00:59:49.954 --> 00:59:52.870
Like, I'm still, like,
speechless,


1012
00:59:52.913 --> 00:59:54.872
which, you know,
is tough for me.


1013
00:59:54.915 --> 00:59:59.093
He was misdirecting us.
He was deflecting us.


1014
00:59:59.137 --> 01:00:00.355
He was, like,
putting up fake people,


1015
01:00:00.399 --> 01:00:02.314
fake, you know, villains.

1016
01:00:02.357 --> 01:00:03.707
Don't be so negative, man.

1017
01:00:03.750 --> 01:00:06.144
I know you thought
you lost Rinaldo,


1018
01:00:06.187 --> 01:00:08.407
but that's not the case, is it?

1019
01:00:08.450 --> 01:00:10.844
That's not the case.

1020
01:00:10.888 --> 01:00:12.672
- Mitch: I guess it's not.
- We sh--


1021
01:00:12.716 --> 01:00:15.501
[laughing]
Hey! This guy's everywhere.


1022
01:00:15.544 --> 01:00:19.418
Mitch, you sure you
don't need-- [laughing]


1023
01:00:19.461 --> 01:00:21.550
You going to be all right or
what, man? Doesn't look like--


1024
01:00:21.594 --> 01:00:23.030
I'm not going to be.

1025
01:00:23.074 --> 01:00:26.251
Well, here.
Cheers to Rinaldo being alive.


1026
01:00:26.294 --> 01:00:28.819
- Yes.
- Okay?


1027
01:00:28.862 --> 01:00:31.560
You know, this has been
really a draining experience.


1028
01:00:31.604 --> 01:00:33.737
It's taken a lot out of me
emotionally, physically,


1029
01:00:33.780 --> 01:00:35.695
mentally, financially.

1030
01:00:35.739 --> 01:00:39.351
I got nothing. 
I got nothing.

1031
01:00:41.048 --> 01:00:43.485
But I'm still standing.

1032
01:00:43.529 --> 01:00:45.966
Actually, still sitting, but
standing, if you want to get--


1033
01:00:46.010 --> 01:00:48.708
I guess I should have expected
the unexpected.


1034
01:00:48.752 --> 01:00:51.319
Well, I guess you should have,
and you should have prepared me.


1035
01:00:51.363 --> 01:00:53.060
I mean, I'm in shock, man.

1036
01:00:53.104 --> 01:00:54.583
Well, how could I prepare
you for something--


1037
01:00:54.627 --> 01:00:56.194
I've been through--

1038
01:00:56.237 --> 01:00:57.761
The adrenalin, watching
this guy drop in front of me.


1039
01:00:57.804 --> 01:00:59.023
I mean, I heard him
screaming and stuff.


1040
01:00:59.066 --> 01:01:00.372
That was--

1041
01:01:00.415 --> 01:01:02.635
You know, him
being taken out of there


1042
01:01:02.679 --> 01:01:06.726
as a cardiac arrest
or a dead body, whatever,


1043
01:01:06.770 --> 01:01:09.729
we thought he was a goner,
Don Punta.


1044
01:01:09.773 --> 01:01:12.732
And then Rick springs it on us
that no, it's part of the--


1045
01:01:12.776 --> 01:01:14.516
His game plan.

1046
01:01:14.560 --> 01:01:17.955
And that, in and of itself,

1047
01:01:17.998 --> 01:01:19.913
is what, you know,
rings parallels


1048
01:01:19.957 --> 01:01:22.089
with Orson Welles's
last production,


1049
01:01:22.133 --> 01:01:23.874
The Other Side of the Wind.

1050
01:01:23.917 --> 01:01:25.876
- You know what?
- I don't know.


1051
01:01:25.919 --> 01:01:27.704
You know what? Listen.

1052
01:01:27.747 --> 01:01:30.358
It's okay, man. Roll with the
punches. Roll with the punches.


1053
01:01:30.402 --> 01:01:31.925
I'm just...

1054
01:01:31.969 --> 01:01:33.100
Don't worry, man.
Let's roll with the punches.


1055
01:01:33.144 --> 01:01:34.493
- Okay.
- Let's see.


1056
01:01:34.536 --> 01:01:35.494
- Okay. I appreciate that.
- Come with me.


1057
01:01:35.537 --> 01:01:36.756
Let's take a little walk.

1058
01:01:36.800 --> 01:01:38.062
Mitch:
And you know what?


1059
01:01:38.105 --> 01:01:40.238
We still have
some great footage.


1060
01:01:40.281 --> 01:01:44.285
I think we could turn this into
a documentary about a film


1061
01:01:44.329 --> 01:01:46.070
being made of a documentary
being made of a film,


1062
01:01:46.113 --> 01:01:49.116
sort of like the Orson Welles
The Other Side of the Wind


1063
01:01:49.160 --> 01:01:51.031
but, you know, on steroids.

1064
01:01:51.075 --> 01:01:53.817
- I'll see you in Toronto.
- Goran: All right. [laughing]


1065
01:01:53.860 --> 01:01:55.862
Look where he is.
He's here again.


1066
01:01:55.906 --> 01:01:58.909
This guy's unbelievable.
Say hi, Mitch.


1067
01:01:58.952 --> 01:02:00.780
I have nothing
to say to him, actually.


1068
01:02:00.824 --> 01:02:02.173
- All right.
- Nothing to say to him.


1069
01:02:02.216 --> 01:02:03.609
Rick:
Mitch, you're not talking to me?


1070
01:02:03.652 --> 01:02:05.219
I'm not talking to you.

1071
01:02:05.263 --> 01:02:07.656
Goran: I wonder if
that was even cocaine


1072
01:02:07.700 --> 01:02:09.397
this guy was doing
in front of me.


1073
01:02:09.441 --> 01:02:11.965
All I can say is...

1074
01:02:12.009 --> 01:02:13.924
That guy's a hell of
an actor, I'll tell you.


1075
01:02:13.967 --> 01:02:15.664
I didn't think
he was that good an actor.


1076
01:02:15.708 --> 01:02:17.318
- I've never seen anyone...
- That was amazing.


1077
01:02:17.362 --> 01:02:20.060
...act like they're dead.
Completely convinced me.


1078
01:02:20.104 --> 01:02:23.803
Well, maybe it's restoring
my faith in acting.


1079
01:02:23.847 --> 01:02:26.066
And you know,
I thought I knew it all,


1080
01:02:26.110 --> 01:02:28.199
saw it all.

1081
01:02:28.242 --> 01:02:31.593
Maybe there's another film
or show left in me, so--


1082
01:02:31.637 --> 01:02:33.508
Oh, you know what, my friend?

1083
01:02:33.552 --> 01:02:36.120
Give me a little time. I think
I could, like, pick myself up.


1084
01:02:36.163 --> 01:02:37.643
Yeah, you can. Sure you can.

1085
01:02:37.686 --> 01:02:39.863
Mitch:
You know, I could fight it.


1086
01:02:39.906 --> 01:02:41.516
- Goran: Absolutely.
- Mitch: I'm down but not out.


1087
01:02:41.560 --> 01:02:43.127
Goran: That's how I see
you, my friend: a fighter.


1088
01:02:43.170 --> 01:02:44.389
I'm down but not out.

1089
01:02:44.432 --> 01:02:45.825
Don't let this throw you.

1090
01:02:45.869 --> 01:02:47.827
I'm sure he's thrown you
curveballs before.


1091
01:02:47.871 --> 01:02:51.744
[coughing]

1092
01:02:51.788 --> 01:02:54.007
Bad throat, though.
But I'm not dead.


1093
01:02:54.051 --> 01:02:56.705
I think I could come back.
I love film.


1094
01:02:56.749 --> 01:02:59.143
It's never over for me.

1095
01:02:59.186 --> 01:03:01.493
He always used to say, Rick,
"It's over. We're done.


1096
01:03:01.536 --> 01:03:03.147
This is the last scene.
We're done."


1097
01:03:03.190 --> 01:03:05.714
I say I don't want it to be
over. I love filmmaking.


1098
01:03:05.758 --> 01:03:08.413
I love acting.
I love producing, you know.


1099
01:03:08.456 --> 01:03:09.980
And I can't see it over.

1100
01:03:10.023 --> 01:03:12.939
I mean, you know,
I'm back for a little loop here


1101
01:03:12.983 --> 01:03:17.030
with this Rinaldo thing.

1102
01:03:17.074 --> 01:03:18.858
Anyway, let's go back
to the villa.


1103
01:03:18.902 --> 01:03:20.468
Here's the villa.
Let's see what goes down now.


1104
01:03:20.512 --> 01:03:22.383
Let's see what's here.

1105
01:03:22.427 --> 01:03:25.299
Goran:
You got to be shitting me.


1106
01:03:25.343 --> 01:03:28.563
Oh, my God.
You son of a bitch.


1107
01:03:28.607 --> 01:03:32.611
You made us think you were...
You going to let us in?


1108
01:03:32.654 --> 01:03:35.179
That OD stunt?

1109
01:03:35.222 --> 01:03:37.224
[chuckling]

1110
01:03:37.268 --> 01:03:39.183
You know, hey,
let me in on it, guys.


1111
01:03:39.226 --> 01:03:42.055
You know what you
put this guy through?


1112
01:03:42.099 --> 01:03:44.231
- That's unbelievable.
- Rinaldo, you were dead.


1113
01:03:44.275 --> 01:03:45.885
You were dead.
I felt your pulse.


1114
01:03:45.929 --> 01:03:47.408
Rinaldo: Maybe it was an
overdose or something.


1115
01:03:47.452 --> 01:03:49.149
There was no pulse.
You had no pulse.


1116
01:03:49.193 --> 01:03:51.151
How did you do that? That's
the best acting I've ever seen.


1117
01:03:51.195 --> 01:03:52.849
We thought you died.

1118
01:03:52.892 --> 01:03:54.894
I was, like, giving you
mouth-to-mouth resuscitation.


1119
01:03:54.938 --> 01:03:56.417
- Yeah, man. He really cared.
- And I care about you.


1120
01:03:56.461 --> 01:03:57.679
- Rinaldo: Thank you.
- I'm devastated.


1121
01:03:57.723 --> 01:03:59.203
Shut the fuck up! I don't care.

1122
01:03:59.246 --> 01:04:00.508
- Stay there. Stay there.
- See, right there.


1123
01:04:00.552 --> 01:04:02.119
- I'm going. I'm gone.
- Okay.


1124
01:04:02.162 --> 01:04:03.555
- You had a project with me.
- You made up your mind.


1125
01:04:03.598 --> 01:04:05.209
- You fuck yourself!
- It's your own choice.


1126
01:04:05.252 --> 01:04:06.906
Enough of this.
I'm tired. I'm done!


1127
01:04:06.950 --> 01:04:08.908
It's your own choice, man, okay?

1128
01:04:08.952 --> 01:04:10.344
It's your choice. Remember.

1129
01:04:10.388 --> 01:04:12.869
This guy, man,
he was broken down.


1130
01:04:12.912 --> 01:04:15.088
Now, are you with him, or no?
Are you in the same boat?


1131
01:04:15.132 --> 01:04:16.437
No, no. Let me in, buddy.

1132
01:04:16.481 --> 01:04:18.657
Come on. Come on before--

1133
01:04:18.700 --> 01:04:20.137
He's a hell of a guy, man.

1134
01:04:20.180 --> 01:04:21.529
He's such a nice guy.
I don't know why...


1135
01:04:21.573 --> 01:04:22.922
Before he comes in.

1136
01:04:22.966 --> 01:04:24.184
...you destroyed him
as an actor there.


1137
01:04:24.228 --> 01:04:26.143
But hey, you're alive, man.

1138
01:04:26.186 --> 01:04:27.927
Let me feel you.

1139
01:04:27.971 --> 01:04:30.843
There you are, eh?
Come on back, bro.


1140
01:04:30.887 --> 01:04:33.454
Come on in here, guys.
Get in here.


1141
01:04:33.498 --> 01:04:35.195
Give the guy a hug. Come on.

1142
01:04:35.239 --> 01:04:38.285
That's it. There you go.

1143
01:05:05.791 --> 01:05:09.621
[laughing]
See, Goran? He's real.


1144
01:05:09.664 --> 01:05:11.928
I'm not delusional.

1145
01:05:11.971 --> 01:05:14.539
[laughing] You're wrong.

1146
01:05:14.582 --> 01:05:16.715
You all thought I was crazy.

1147
01:05:16.758 --> 01:05:18.021
You thought
I was crazy. I'm not crazy.


1148
01:05:18.064 --> 01:05:19.761
I'm not crazy.

1149
01:05:19.805 --> 01:05:22.460
Goran, he's at the Nacional.

1150
01:05:22.503 --> 01:05:24.766
I saw him. I saw him.

1151
01:05:24.810 --> 01:05:26.551
I talked to him.

1152
01:05:26.594 --> 01:05:29.554
He's real. I touched him.
I talked to him.


1153
01:05:29.597 --> 01:05:31.860
I got it!

1154
01:05:31.904 --> 01:05:33.514
Oh, my God. I
got it. I got it.

1155
01:05:33.558 --> 01:05:35.473
Hey, Goran. Goran, I got it.

1156
01:05:35.516 --> 01:05:37.431
I got it. The tunnel.

1157
01:05:37.475 --> 01:05:40.652
Driving off into
the sunset. It's brilliant.


1158
01:05:40.695 --> 01:05:43.872
It's amazing. It came to me.
It was like a dream.


1159
01:05:43.916 --> 01:05:46.527
What is it, my friend? What is
it? What is it? What is it?


1160
01:05:46.571 --> 01:05:47.833
- He's here.
- Oh, okay. He's here, is he?


1161
01:05:47.876 --> 01:05:49.139
He's here. Rick's here in Cuba.

1162
01:05:49.182 --> 01:05:50.923
Okay. He's here in Cuba.

1163
01:05:50.967 --> 01:05:52.185
There is no Rick.
Just be honest.


1164
01:05:52.229 --> 01:05:53.621
I was told
at the boutique hotel.


1165
01:05:53.665 --> 01:05:54.622
- Be honest with me, Mitch.
- We were there.


1166
01:05:54.666 --> 01:05:55.623
We were there.

1167
01:05:55.667 --> 01:05:56.929
He had a room there.

1168
01:05:56.973 --> 01:05:58.409
We were supposed to
meet with him.


1169
01:05:58.452 --> 01:06:00.454
I was told initially
he went to the Nacional.


1170
01:06:00.498 --> 01:06:03.196
I went to the Nacional. Couldn't
find him. Went to Riviera.


1171
01:06:03.240 --> 01:06:05.024
- Yeah, I know. I was with you.
- And then--


1172
01:06:05.068 --> 01:06:07.418
They kicked us out of there
because someone had a camera.


1173
01:06:07.461 --> 01:06:08.897
- And then--
- Then we went


1174
01:06:08.941 --> 01:06:10.290
to the boutique hotel.
We couldn't even--


1175
01:06:10.334 --> 01:06:11.944
- But he was there.
- He was there, was he?


1176
01:06:11.988 --> 01:06:13.902
He was there. He was there.
He had a room there.


1177
01:06:13.946 --> 01:06:15.513
- We were going to--
- Didn't you tell me


1178
01:06:15.556 --> 01:06:18.951
that you saw his ghost
walking around Old Havana?


1179
01:06:18.995 --> 01:06:21.345
Do you remember telling me that?

1180
01:06:21.388 --> 01:06:24.304
How much more of this bullshit
do you want me to buy?


1181
01:06:24.348 --> 01:06:26.219
And not only that.
What kind of production is this?


1182
01:06:26.263 --> 01:06:27.829
You got no permits.

1183
01:06:27.873 --> 01:06:29.701
We get kicked out of
every place we've been at.


1184
01:06:29.744 --> 01:06:31.311
- Precisely.
- I'm up to here with this.


1185
01:06:31.355 --> 01:06:33.487
That's how Rick works.
We never use permits.


1186
01:06:33.531 --> 01:06:35.098
- We don't use permits.
- What Rick?


1187
01:06:35.141 --> 01:06:36.621
- It's guerrilla filmmaking.
- There is no Rick.


1188
01:06:36.664 --> 01:06:37.926
- There is Rick.
- No, there's--


1189
01:06:37.970 --> 01:06:39.450
He directed me.
He told me to do this.


1190
01:06:39.493 --> 01:06:41.713
I've been on this production
a couple of times,


1191
01:06:41.756 --> 01:06:43.280
and I've never met this Rick.

1192
01:06:43.323 --> 01:06:45.064
Don't you get it?

1193
01:06:45.108 --> 01:06:47.849
I'm the wing man. 
Rick is alive.

1194
01:06:47.893 --> 01:06:49.721
He's real, but he didn't want
to be the wing man.


1195
01:06:49.764 --> 01:06:52.332
I'm the wing man.
I morphed into the wing man.


1196
01:06:52.376 --> 01:06:53.812
I morphed into Rick.

1197
01:06:53.855 --> 01:06:56.162
You understand now?
You really understand?


1198
01:06:56.206 --> 01:06:57.511
Can I ask you a question?

1199
01:06:57.555 --> 01:06:58.947
You can ask me
anything you want.


1200
01:06:58.991 --> 01:07:00.819
Don't take this
in any wrong way,


1201
01:07:00.862 --> 01:07:04.083
but... have you ever had,
you know, therapy before?


1202
01:07:04.127 --> 01:07:07.260
Rick is alive,
but I've become Rick.


1203
01:07:07.304 --> 01:07:11.656
Does that make any sense?

1204
01:07:11.699 --> 01:07:14.615
Goran:
Good luck, pal.


1205
01:07:14.659 --> 01:07:16.617
Where you going? Goran, Goran.

1206
01:07:16.661 --> 01:07:20.882
Goran, it was a hero's
journey, man. I'm the hero.


1207
01:07:20.926 --> 01:07:23.059
Goran: The world
doesn't need another hero.


1208
01:07:23.102 --> 01:07:24.756
I hope you can live
with yourself.


1209
01:07:24.799 --> 01:07:26.888
You don't treat people
like that.


1210
01:07:26.932 --> 01:07:28.586
You know, we put our souls out
for your production,


1211
01:07:28.629 --> 01:07:30.327
and this is how you do it?

1212
01:07:30.370 --> 01:07:33.156
Dude, I don't think I ever
want to see you again.


1213
01:07:33.199 --> 01:07:34.853
And one more thing.

1214
01:07:34.896 --> 01:07:37.073
You morphing into Rick,
whether he's real or not,


1215
01:07:37.116 --> 01:07:39.945
it just implies
where you're going to end up.


1216
01:07:39.988 --> 01:07:42.121
You're going to
be all alone, all right?


1217
01:07:42.165 --> 01:07:44.123
Think that through.

1218
01:07:44.167 --> 01:07:45.951
And if that hurts,
I'm glad it does,


1219
01:07:45.994 --> 01:07:47.387
because you can't imagine
how I feel,


1220
01:07:47.431 --> 01:07:51.087
some of the others
on your production feel.


1221
01:08:13.065 --> 01:08:16.024
Mitch:
You smell the rain?


1222
01:08:16.068 --> 01:08:19.027
There's a storm coming.

1223
01:08:19.071 --> 01:08:20.725
Wow.

1224
01:08:20.768 --> 01:08:23.119
What a great way to go.

1225
01:08:39.178 --> 01:08:41.441
Rick: You know,
there's three types of people


1226
01:08:41.485 --> 01:08:43.139
in this world:
people that make things happen,


1227
01:08:43.182 --> 01:08:44.444
people that watch things happen,

1228
01:08:44.488 --> 01:08:46.229
and people
that wonder what happened.


1229
01:08:46.272 --> 01:08:49.188
And really, that moment--

1230
01:08:49.232 --> 01:08:51.495
Really, you have defining
moments in your life,


1231
01:08:51.538 --> 01:08:53.975
and that was really one of them.

1232
01:09:17.173 --> 01:09:19.436
Rick:
You know, he loved the rain.


1233
01:09:19.479 --> 01:09:21.394
And he's in the water,

1234
01:09:21.438 --> 01:09:24.397
and he's always having
this dream that he's drowning.


1235
01:09:24.441 --> 01:09:28.184
Because in the dream is--
he doesn't have enough time.


1236
01:09:28.227 --> 01:09:31.056
You know, he might have
had a day or two to live.


1237
01:09:31.099 --> 01:09:34.102
Because he had
something to say, so...


1238
01:09:41.806 --> 01:09:45.201
But he gave me
the greatest gift back.


1239
01:10:14.186 --> 01:10:17.320
Rick: You know,
then he died shortly after,


1240
01:10:17.363 --> 01:10:19.060
but he was a good man.

1241
01:10:19.104 --> 01:10:21.280
I mean, beautiful man,
beautiful man.
