1
00:00:04.048 --> 00:00:05.549
There's an old story,

2
00:00:05.582 --> 00:00:07.886
and it's used in
various cultures, where


3
00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:10.221
a group of blind men
approach an elephant


4
00:00:10.255 --> 00:00:11.823
and try to describe him.

5
00:00:11.855 --> 00:00:15.459
The first man approaches the
elephant, touches its side,


6
00:00:15.493 --> 00:00:17.996
and says, it feels like a wall.

7
00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:21.332
The next man touches
a tusk and says,


8
00:00:21.366 --> 00:00:23.669
the elephant must
be like a spear.


9
00:00:23.701 --> 00:00:27.371
Another blind man touches
the trunk and says,


10
00:00:27.404 --> 00:00:29.840
it feels like a snake.

11
00:00:29.874 --> 00:00:33.544
And that is quite often what
happens with our descriptions


12
00:00:33.578 --> 00:00:34.846
of the Black Panther Party.

13
00:00:34.879 --> 00:00:40.152
We know the party we were
in and not the entire thing.


14
00:00:40.185 --> 00:00:46.224
We were making history and
it wasn't nice and clean.


15
00:00:46.257 --> 00:00:47.993
It wasn't easy.

16
00:00:48.026 --> 00:00:50.861
It was complex.

17
00:00:50.895 --> 00:00:53.432
From Chicago, Illinois,
the mighty Chi-Lites.


18
00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:00.772
For
God's sake, you


19
00:01:00.804 --> 00:01:04.075
got to give more
power to the people.


20
00:01:04.108 --> 00:01:09.047
There's some people up
there hogging everything.


21
00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:11.048
The thing
that led to the Panthers


22
00:01:11.081 --> 00:01:14.218
was what we were seeing
on television every day...


23
00:01:14.252 --> 00:01:17.188
attack dogs, fire
hoses, bombings.


24
00:01:17.221 --> 00:01:21.226
We stand on the eve of a
black revolution, brothers.


25
00:01:21.259 --> 00:01:22.861
Now we
have the emergence


26
00:01:22.893 --> 00:01:25.963
of voices within the
community that were saying,


27
00:01:25.997 --> 00:01:29.568
we're not going to continue
to turn the other cheek.


28
00:01:29.601 --> 00:01:32.036
You tell them white
folk in Mississippi


29
00:01:32.069 --> 00:01:34.038
that all the scared
niggers are dead.


30
00:01:35.072 --> 00:01:37.041
We want black power.

31
00:01:37.074 --> 00:01:39.009
We want black power.

32
00:01:44.416 --> 00:01:46.551
This
was a revolutionary time.


33
00:01:46.583 --> 00:01:49.420
50 countries in the world
gained their independence


34
00:01:49.453 --> 00:01:53.057
in the decade before the
founding of the Black Panther


35
00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:54.259
Party.

36
00:01:54.292 --> 00:01:56.294
This was the time when
people are getting drafted


37
00:01:56.327 --> 00:01:59.297
to go and fight in Vietnam.

38
00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:01.133
So if somebody's
coming and saying well,


39
00:02:01.166 --> 00:02:02.600
if you're going
to fight, why not


40
00:02:02.634 --> 00:02:07.172
fight right here in LA
or Oakland, you know?


41
00:02:07.205 --> 00:02:09.940
That made a lot of sense.

42
00:02:09.974 --> 00:02:13.477
You couldn't be
absent and see what we saw.


43
00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:15.780
We couldn't unsee it.

44
00:02:15.814 --> 00:02:19.985
I was a cocktail waitress
in a white strip club


45
00:02:20.017 --> 00:02:22.953
two years before I joined
the Black Panther Party.


46
00:02:22.987 --> 00:02:24.923
How did that happen?

47
00:02:24.956 --> 00:02:26.925
The rage was in the streets.

48
00:02:26.957 --> 00:02:28.058
It was everywhere.

49
00:02:32.931 --> 00:02:34.866
We're
not gonna get nothing.


50
00:02:34.898 --> 00:02:36.867
Not by sitting around
here and just doing


51
00:02:36.901 --> 00:02:38.670
these sit-in
demonstrations and nothing.


52
00:02:38.702 --> 00:02:40.171
People are not going
to do anything.


53
00:02:40.205 --> 00:02:42.006
But how are
we going to do it?


54
00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:43.675
By violence.

55
00:02:43.707 --> 00:02:45.976
Violence.

56
00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:48.447
By uprising, having
a revolution.


57
00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:50.081
Just with blood, you know.

58
00:02:50.113 --> 00:02:52.283
Let everybody
bleed a little bit.


59
00:03:01.426 --> 00:03:02.761
Relations

60
00:03:02.794 --> 00:03:05.130
between police and Negroes
throughout the country


61
00:03:05.163 --> 00:03:05.897
are getting worse.

62
00:03:11.602 --> 00:03:14.039
One of the cities most
troubled by animosity


63
00:03:14.071 --> 00:03:16.175
between police and Negroes
is Oakland, California.


64
00:03:19.944 --> 00:03:23.982
People always talked about
freedom and what that means


65
00:03:24.015 --> 00:03:25.283
during that time period.

66
00:03:25.315 --> 00:03:28.719
Being black in America meant
that you didn't walk down


67
00:03:28.753 --> 00:03:31.857
the street with the
same sense of safety


68
00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:35.292
and the same sense of
privilege as a white person.


69
00:03:35.326 --> 00:03:36.727
There was absolutely
no difference


70
00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:39.897
in the way the police treated
us in Mississippi than they


71
00:03:39.931 --> 00:03:41.166
did in California.

72
00:03:41.199 --> 00:03:43.034
They may not have called
you nigger everyday,


73
00:03:43.066 --> 00:03:45.771
but they treated you the same
way they did in Mississippi.


74
00:03:49.172 --> 00:03:50.641
The
police jump on you,


75
00:03:50.675 --> 00:03:53.979
beat you up, put the
gun at your head.


76
00:03:54.011 --> 00:03:58.516
This is what we were going
through on a daily basis.


77
00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:00.451
When I
first met Huey and Bobby,


78
00:04:00.485 --> 00:04:05.290
they were in the process
of forming an organization


79
00:04:05.322 --> 00:04:06.891
for primarily self-defense.

80
00:04:09.927 --> 00:04:13.964
We didn't plan to have a
nationwide organization


81
00:04:13.997 --> 00:04:15.432
or anything like that.

82
00:04:15.465 --> 00:04:20.771
We were organizing, dealing
with the problems in Oakland.


83
00:04:20.804 --> 00:04:24.208
We use the
Black Panther as our symbol


84
00:04:24.242 --> 00:04:27.946
because the nature of panther,
panther doesn't strike anyone,


85
00:04:27.978 --> 00:04:32.349
but when he's assailed upon
that he'll back up first.


86
00:04:32.382 --> 00:04:36.654
But if the aggressor continues
then he'll strike out.


87
00:04:36.687 --> 00:04:39.658
Huey
had studied the law.


88
00:04:39.691 --> 00:04:41.593
In Oakland at that
particular time,


89
00:04:41.626 --> 00:04:46.530
anyone could carry a firearm
who did not have a felony


90
00:04:46.564 --> 00:04:48.333
conviction at the time.

91
00:04:48.365 --> 00:04:50.167
The firearm could
not be concealed.


92
00:04:50.201 --> 00:04:51.703
It had to be in the open.

93
00:04:51.735 --> 00:04:55.940
The California Penal Code,
section 12020 through 12027,


94
00:04:55.973 --> 00:04:58.309
and also the Second Amendment
of the Constitution,


95
00:04:58.343 --> 00:05:01.580
guarantees the citizen
a right to bear arms


96
00:05:01.612 --> 00:05:03.682
on public property.

97
00:05:03.715 --> 00:05:05.951
Huey said
we're going to carry our guns


98
00:05:05.984 --> 00:05:07.786
and we're going to
follow the police.


99
00:05:07.819 --> 00:05:11.956
And if they stop someone,
we're going to stop.


100
00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:14.692
We're going to maintain
a legal distance


101
00:05:14.725 --> 00:05:18.829
and we're going to observe
the so-called law officers


102
00:05:18.862 --> 00:05:21.098
in performance of their duties.

103
00:05:32.175 --> 00:05:34.345
We were in
the car and driving around,


104
00:05:34.379 --> 00:05:35.513
having fun.

105
00:05:35.545 --> 00:05:37.548
We would... we was looking
at the pretty women


106
00:05:37.581 --> 00:05:38.683
and chasing the sisters.

107
00:05:47.458 --> 00:05:51.429
Then something might happen, and
then all of a sudden the focus


108
00:05:51.461 --> 00:05:52.530
would just become serious.

109
00:05:57.235 --> 00:05:59.136
We're
coming around the corner.


110
00:05:59.170 --> 00:06:00.437
Stay facing where you are.

111
00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:01.639
We would stop.

112
00:06:01.672 --> 00:06:04.274
We would get out of the cars.

113
00:06:04.307 --> 00:06:08.946
We would walk up to the scene.

114
00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:12.083
Those who had rifles
would carry them


115
00:06:12.115 --> 00:06:14.318
in the open, clearly visible.

116
00:06:14.352 --> 00:06:17.622
We would stand at a,
a distance where


117
00:06:17.655 --> 00:06:19.791
the police couldn't say
that we were interfering


118
00:06:19.824 --> 00:06:23.862
with their arrest or their
detention of the individual


119
00:06:23.894 --> 00:06:26.897
and, make sure that
there was no brutality.


120
00:06:30.667 --> 00:06:33.672
We stood back with our
weapons, ready to throw down


121
00:06:33.704 --> 00:06:35.072
if necessary.

122
00:06:35.105 --> 00:06:40.244
They would, take the weapon
and pass it across like this,


123
00:06:40.278 --> 00:06:44.516
and it would sweep... pass
right over the officer.


124
00:06:44.549 --> 00:06:46.785
No
one would do anything


125
00:06:46.817 --> 00:06:52.790
until a policeman ejected
a round in the chamber.


126
00:06:52.824 --> 00:06:56.026
Then we would all eject
rounds in the chamber,


127
00:06:56.059 --> 00:06:58.396
and all up and
down the street you


128
00:06:58.429 --> 00:07:00.899
could hear this clackity-clack,
clack, clack, clack.


129
00:07:00.932 --> 00:07:05.437
And then when the traffic
stop or the incident's over,


130
00:07:05.470 --> 00:07:08.506
they'd bring the weapon
down across by you like this


131
00:07:08.538 --> 00:07:11.509
and get back in their
car and drive off.


132
00:07:11.542 --> 00:07:15.013
It was pretty intimidating.

133
00:07:15.045 --> 00:07:19.950
We referred to ourselves
as the vanguard,


134
00:07:19.984 --> 00:07:24.489
and we were setting, by example,
a new course that we wanted


135
00:07:24.521 --> 00:07:25.856
the entire community to follow.

136
00:07:31.261 --> 00:07:33.631
No one wants to touch
the legitimate hunter,


137
00:07:33.663 --> 00:07:37.167
but we've got to protect
society from nuts with guns.


138
00:07:37.201 --> 00:07:40.438
When bands of armed
people with loaded weapons


139
00:07:40.470 --> 00:07:44.208
can move about our streets,
intimidating and frightening


140
00:07:44.242 --> 00:07:46.410
citizens, then I
think we should act.


141
00:07:46.444 --> 00:07:48.580
And we intend to act.

142
00:07:48.612 --> 00:07:52.750
It's my intention to make it a
misdemeanor to have, loaded


143
00:07:52.783 --> 00:07:57.122
rifles and shotguns and
weapons in public places.


144
00:07:57.155 --> 00:07:58.556
The
police department


145
00:07:58.588 --> 00:08:01.358
had went to a local congressman
to get a bill written.


146
00:08:01.391 --> 00:08:03.827
So Huey called me up and says,
we have to go to Sacramento.


147
00:08:03.860 --> 00:08:05.730
It was conceived
as a media event


148
00:08:05.763 --> 00:08:10.468
that the press is always at
the California state capitol.


149
00:08:10.501 --> 00:08:13.905
No one really
wanted Huey himself to go,


150
00:08:13.937 --> 00:08:17.741
because Huey was kind of a
quick-tempered firebrand.


151
00:08:17.775 --> 00:08:21.679
Bobby was a little
more cautious.


152
00:08:21.711 --> 00:08:23.647
And it was like, look.

153
00:08:23.680 --> 00:08:26.550
You know, you've
been great so far,


154
00:08:26.584 --> 00:08:31.690
but you might blow it up there,
and bad things could happen.


155
00:08:39.730 --> 00:08:43.167
We caravaned to Sacramento.

156
00:08:43.201 --> 00:08:48.439
I think there were about 30 of
us altogether, and most of us


157
00:08:48.471 --> 00:08:49.507
had weapon.

158
00:08:52.442 --> 00:08:55.145
We was on the
state capitol on the lawn,


159
00:08:55.178 --> 00:08:57.749
and Ronald Reagan...
then the governor


160
00:08:57.782 --> 00:09:01.886
of the state of California...
was there about 10 feet away


161
00:09:01.918 --> 00:09:04.889
from us holding a
press conference


162
00:09:04.922 --> 00:09:10.161
with these young, like,
parochial school kids.


163
00:09:10.193 --> 00:09:13.897
And what happened, as
soon as the press seen us


164
00:09:13.931 --> 00:09:15.800
they gravitated
from Ronald Reagan


165
00:09:15.832 --> 00:09:18.068
over to where the Panthers was.

166
00:09:18.101 --> 00:09:19.837
The Black Panther
Party for Self Defense


167
00:09:19.870 --> 00:09:21.805
calls upon the American
people in general,


168
00:09:21.839 --> 00:09:23.273
and the black people
in particular,


169
00:09:23.307 --> 00:09:26.411
to take careful note of
the racist California


170
00:09:26.443 --> 00:09:29.947
legislature which is now
considering legislation aimed


171
00:09:29.980 --> 00:09:32.683
at keeping the black people
disarmed and powerless


172
00:09:32.716 --> 00:09:34.985
at the very same
time racist police


173
00:09:35.018 --> 00:09:38.556
agencies throughout the country
are intensifying the terror,


174
00:09:38.589 --> 00:09:41.792
brutality, murder, and
repression of black people.


175
00:09:41.826 --> 00:09:43.228
The
state assembly was


176
00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:45.762
in the midst of a heated debate
when the young Negroes, armed


177
00:09:45.796 --> 00:09:47.932
with loaded rifles,
shotguns and pistols,


178
00:09:47.965 --> 00:09:49.399
marched into the capital.

179
00:09:49.432 --> 00:09:51.836
When we got in
the halls, you have to imagine,


180
00:09:51.869 --> 00:09:55.373
there's 100 cameras... still
cameras, print media people...


181
00:09:55.406 --> 00:09:56.507
backing up.

182
00:09:56.539 --> 00:09:57.941
And I'm saying, where is
the spectator section?


183
00:09:57.975 --> 00:10:01.879
And the press says
this way, Bobby.


184
00:10:01.913 --> 00:10:04.816
Some party members got ahead
of me with shotguns, pistols


185
00:10:04.849 --> 00:10:08.419
and wound up on the actual
floor of the California State


186
00:10:08.451 --> 00:10:09.553
legislature.

187
00:10:09.586 --> 00:10:10.955
They're heavily armed.

188
00:10:10.988 --> 00:10:13.391
Whether their weapons are loaded
or not, nobody seems to know.


189
00:10:26.770 --> 00:10:28.305
The
armed group, who said


190
00:10:28.339 --> 00:10:30.275
they were members of
the Black Panther Party,


191
00:10:30.307 --> 00:10:32.242
retreated to a service
station several blocks


192
00:10:32.275 --> 00:10:33.443
from the capital.

193
00:10:33.476 --> 00:10:35.545
I remember this one cop
came down on a motorcycle,


194
00:10:35.579 --> 00:10:37.115
and he's seen all
these guns, and he


195
00:10:37.148 --> 00:10:39.550
got on the... on the thing.

196
00:10:39.582 --> 00:10:41.685
And that's when they
started to swoop down


197
00:10:41.719 --> 00:10:43.388
on us from everywhere.

198
00:10:43.421 --> 00:10:45.757
You have no right to
take my gun away from me.


199
00:10:45.789 --> 00:10:47.724
You don't know the
constitutional right?


200
00:10:47.758 --> 00:10:48.826
Sure we do.

201
00:10:48.859 --> 00:10:50.728
We're well aware of
the constitutionality.


202
00:10:50.760 --> 00:10:53.331
I would like to
have my gun back.


203
00:10:53.364 --> 00:10:55.600
Why do you believe the
legislature is racist?


204
00:10:55.633 --> 00:10:57.268
Because, you know,
you're a part of it.


205
00:10:57.301 --> 00:10:57.969
Isn't it obvious?

206
00:10:58.001 --> 00:10:59.736
This is a white system.

207
00:10:59.769 --> 00:11:02.139
The
news got to everyone


208
00:11:02.172 --> 00:11:05.509
in the black community who
had a television, everyone


209
00:11:05.542 --> 00:11:07.544
who had a radio.

210
00:11:07.577 --> 00:11:11.481
It was in every newspaper
across the nation.


211
00:11:11.514 --> 00:11:15.519
It put us on center stage.

212
00:11:15.552 --> 00:11:17.956
I don't think
that loaded guns is the way


213
00:11:17.989 --> 00:11:19.990
to solve a problem
that should be solved


214
00:11:20.023 --> 00:11:21.859
between people of good will.

215
00:11:21.892 --> 00:11:24.429
And anyone who would approve
of this kind of demonstration


216
00:11:24.461 --> 00:11:25.429
must be out of their mind.

217
00:11:31.167 --> 00:11:33.437
When I
heard about Sacramento,


218
00:11:33.470 --> 00:11:37.542
I was like, damn,
these brothers are bad.


219
00:11:37.575 --> 00:11:40.578
They're here up in Sacramento,
in the capital, packing?


220
00:11:48.251 --> 00:11:52.055
The boldness,
the courageousness about it,


221
00:11:52.089 --> 00:11:56.761
the arrogance of it... that put
a whole new face on things.


222
00:11:56.793 --> 00:11:59.463
I said man, I want to be part
of this, whatever that is.


223
00:12:04.100 --> 00:12:05.903
Yeah, I
walked into the office


224
00:12:05.936 --> 00:12:08.740
and told them I wanted to
join the Black Panther Party,


225
00:12:08.773 --> 00:12:11.942
and they kind of laughed.

226
00:12:11.975 --> 00:12:14.745
I didn't know that there
were any other women


227
00:12:14.778 --> 00:12:17.715
in the party at that time.

228
00:12:17.748 --> 00:12:19.850
But then I asked them,
could I have a gun?


229
00:12:22.286 --> 00:12:24.455
I was a
student at Lincoln University


230
00:12:24.488 --> 00:12:27.558
outside Philly when I first
heard about the Black Panther


231
00:12:27.590 --> 00:12:28.658
Party.

232
00:12:28.691 --> 00:12:32.730
I found my friend, John
Huggins, and I said,


233
00:12:32.763 --> 00:12:35.600
we need to leave
this stupid campus.


234
00:12:35.633 --> 00:12:37.067
We have work to do.

235
00:12:37.100 --> 00:12:40.538
We got in John Huggins'
little hooptie car


236
00:12:40.571 --> 00:12:44.075
and we drove across the
country from New York,


237
00:12:44.108 --> 00:12:45.710
and when we got
to the west coast


238
00:12:45.743 --> 00:12:49.647
we joined the Black
Panther Party.


239
00:12:49.680 --> 00:12:52.683
What we
want, what we believe.


240
00:12:52.715 --> 00:12:55.052
Point
number one, we want freedom.


241
00:12:55.086 --> 00:12:57.288
We
want decent housing.


242
00:12:57.321 --> 00:12:59.624
We want an
an education for our people.


243
00:12:59.657 --> 00:13:01.359
We
want an immediate end


244
00:13:01.392 --> 00:13:02.693
to police brutality.

245
00:13:02.725 --> 00:13:04.895
People joined
for all kinds of reasons,


246
00:13:04.928 --> 00:13:08.832
but the Panthers have a 10 point
platform or program that really


247
00:13:08.865 --> 00:13:12.302
was sort of like the fundamental
sort of organizing tool


248
00:13:12.336 --> 00:13:13.504
and orientation tool.

249
00:13:17.374 --> 00:13:19.576
The civil
rights movement was basically


250
00:13:19.610 --> 00:13:20.912
a southern movement.

251
00:13:20.945 --> 00:13:23.214
So when you had an
organization like the Panthers


252
00:13:23.246 --> 00:13:26.983
who were taking on things like
housing and welfare and health,


253
00:13:27.017 --> 00:13:28.619
that was stuff that
people in the north


254
00:13:28.652 --> 00:13:31.589
could relate to
and rally behind.


255
00:13:31.621 --> 00:13:33.056
Our attack was not

256
00:13:33.090 --> 00:13:35.359
only against white
supremacy, but it was also


257
00:13:35.392 --> 00:13:36.727
about capitalism.

258
00:13:36.759 --> 00:13:40.764
We actually thought that the
way in which capitalism created


259
00:13:40.797 --> 00:13:44.568
a working class that was
kept absolutely destitute...


260
00:13:44.601 --> 00:13:45.836
was that was wrong.

261
00:13:45.869 --> 00:13:48.873
So we took the position
that in order for us to free,


262
00:13:48.906 --> 00:13:50.408
that system had
to be dismantled.


263
00:13:50.441 --> 00:13:53.411
We could not be free in a
system that had oppressed us


264
00:13:53.443 --> 00:13:54.478
in the first place.

265
00:13:54.512 --> 00:13:55.980
So you have to get
rid of that system.


266
00:14:01.152 --> 00:14:03.287
We were
not after the church folks.


267
00:14:03.320 --> 00:14:05.089
We were not after
the Muslim folks.


268
00:14:05.121 --> 00:14:06.590
We wanted the brother
on the corner,


269
00:14:06.624 --> 00:14:09.159
the brother who's getting his
head banged in every weekend


270
00:14:09.192 --> 00:14:10.360
by the police.

271
00:14:10.393 --> 00:14:12.663
We wanted the brother who
was going to jail... just


272
00:14:12.696 --> 00:14:14.798
snatched out of this
car for a traffic ticket


273
00:14:14.831 --> 00:14:15.966
because he was black.

274
00:14:15.999 --> 00:14:16.934
That's who we were after.

275
00:14:19.637 --> 00:14:24.675
We get
calls from Atlanta, Nashville,


276
00:14:24.707 --> 00:14:29.646
Raleigh, North Carolina, from
Washington, DC, Bridgeport,


277
00:14:29.680 --> 00:14:33.084
Connecticut... every city,
small or large, you could think


278
00:14:33.116 --> 00:14:35.785
of wanted a chapter of
the Black Panther Party.


279
00:14:47.965 --> 00:14:51.035
We would send members
of the organization


280
00:14:51.067 --> 00:14:55.740
to help connect them to us.

281
00:14:55.773 --> 00:14:57.608
But it was destabilizing
in the sense


282
00:14:57.640 --> 00:15:01.077
that it was somewhat chaotic,
the way the party was growing.


283
00:15:01.110 --> 00:15:05.115
And it was too fast and too big.

284
00:15:05.148 --> 00:15:07.118
There
was no screening process.


285
00:15:07.150 --> 00:15:08.618
There was no, why are you here?

286
00:15:08.652 --> 00:15:10.788
What do you expect to have
happen while you're here?


287
00:15:10.821 --> 00:15:12.190
What are you trying
to accomplish?


288
00:15:12.222 --> 00:15:13.890
There was none of that.

289
00:15:13.923 --> 00:15:16.760
Members came from whoever
just came in off the street.


290
00:15:16.793 --> 00:15:19.263
The downside, of course,
was we had no idea who


291
00:15:19.296 --> 00:15:22.633
any of these people were.

292
00:15:22.666 --> 00:15:24.902
We didn't have time for a
whole lot of, who are you?


293
00:15:24.935 --> 00:15:26.304
What are you doing?

294
00:15:26.336 --> 00:15:27.672
We need... you want to do this?

295
00:15:27.705 --> 00:15:28.105
Fine.

296
00:15:28.138 --> 00:15:28.506
Here.

297
00:15:28.538 --> 00:15:28.939
Go.

298
00:15:33.711 --> 00:15:35.379
This week on
"Firing Line", my guest


299
00:15:35.412 --> 00:15:37.682
is Mr. Eldridge Cleaver,
the information minister


300
00:15:37.715 --> 00:15:40.651
of the Black Panthers.

301
00:15:40.683 --> 00:15:43.053
Eldridge Cleaver
comes out with this book,


302
00:15:43.086 --> 00:15:47.658
"Soul on Ice," a series
of his essays from prison,


303
00:15:47.691 --> 00:15:50.393
and the New York Times
says that it's brilliant,


304
00:15:50.427 --> 00:15:53.163
it gets on to
the best seller list.


305
00:15:53.196 --> 00:15:55.666
So when Eldridge
joined the Panthers,


306
00:15:55.698 --> 00:15:57.100
the Panthers had
gotten themselves


307
00:15:57.134 --> 00:15:59.003
a star, a literary star.

308
00:15:59.036 --> 00:16:00.404
I've been called

309
00:16:00.437 --> 00:16:03.608
by the National Review, the
of the Black


310
00:16:03.640 --> 00:16:04.874
Panther Party.

311
00:16:04.908 --> 00:16:07.912
And all of this is an attempt
to undermine the party


312
00:16:07.945 --> 00:16:12.883
or to give it a bad
presentation to the public.


313
00:16:12.916 --> 00:16:15.653
Huey Newton always
had this vision.


314
00:16:15.686 --> 00:16:17.922
He was the visionary
of the party.


315
00:16:17.955 --> 00:16:21.124
Bobby Seale, he had
the personality.


316
00:16:21.158 --> 00:16:23.393
Eldridge Cleaver
was the person who


317
00:16:23.427 --> 00:16:27.331
made the party credible
to black intellectuals,


318
00:16:27.364 --> 00:16:30.434
to the white, left
intellectuals.


319
00:16:30.466 --> 00:16:34.237
You know, all of them
loved Eldridge Cleaver.


320
00:16:34.270 --> 00:16:36.006
They understood what
he was talking about,


321
00:16:36.039 --> 00:16:38.842
or at least they
thought they did.


322
00:16:38.875 --> 00:16:41.312
Eldridge
had this incredible ability


323
00:16:41.345 --> 00:16:43.814
to encapsulate a thought
in a few sentences


324
00:16:43.846 --> 00:16:47.717
and form it into an artistic
statement that pointed right...


325
00:16:47.750 --> 00:16:49.886
that stabbed right into
the heart of the enemy,


326
00:16:49.919 --> 00:16:51.221
and he did that all of the time.

327
00:16:53.423 --> 00:16:54.891
Now, was he always correct?

328
00:16:54.924 --> 00:16:56.293
No.

329
00:16:56.326 --> 00:16:59.430
And I say that Ronald Reagan is
a punk, a sissy, and a coward,


330
00:16:59.462 --> 00:17:01.898
and I challenge him to a duel.

331
00:17:01.932 --> 00:17:03.901
I challenge him.

332
00:17:03.933 --> 00:17:08.638
I challenge him to a duel
to the death or until he


333
00:17:08.672 --> 00:17:11.142
says Uncle Eldridge.

334
00:17:11.174 --> 00:17:12.809
Was he insane?

335
00:17:12.843 --> 00:17:14.045
Fuck yeah.

336
00:17:14.077 --> 00:17:17.580
That boy was crazy, and he
got a lot of people hurt.


337
00:17:17.614 --> 00:17:20.017
And I give him his
choice of weapon.


338
00:17:20.049 --> 00:17:23.486
He could use a gun, a knife, a
baseball bat or a marshmallow,


339
00:17:23.519 --> 00:17:25.623
and I'll beat him to death
with the marshmallow.


340
00:17:25.655 --> 00:17:28.792
That's how I feel
about him, see?


341
00:17:28.826 --> 00:17:30.694
Now see,
they are not going


342
00:17:30.728 --> 00:17:34.532
to be able to control Eldridge.

343
00:17:34.565 --> 00:17:38.969
Eldridge was a Rottweiler,
uncontrollable personality.


344
00:17:39.001 --> 00:17:41.371
Who could be in an
organization with Eldridge


345
00:17:41.404 --> 00:17:43.340
and he not be the leader?

346
00:17:43.374 --> 00:17:43.775
Nobody.

347
00:17:46.910 --> 00:17:48.379
And that's basically
how it ended up.


348
00:18:01.157 --> 00:18:03.026
A pool of blood marks

349
00:18:03.059 --> 00:18:06.896
the spot where 23-year-old
officer John Frey was found


350
00:18:06.930 --> 00:18:09.467
fatally wounded
from four gunshots.


351
00:18:09.499 --> 00:18:11.434
The shooting happened
at 5:00 AM,


352
00:18:11.468 --> 00:18:14.538
approximately where I'm
standing, on 7th Street


353
00:18:14.570 --> 00:18:17.874
in the heart of
Oakland's Negro ghetto.


354
00:18:17.907 --> 00:18:20.377
The suspect, charged with
murder and attempted murder,


355
00:18:20.411 --> 00:18:23.514
is Huey Newton, 25-year-old
leader of the Black


356
00:18:23.547 --> 00:18:25.915
Panthers for Self Defense.

357
00:18:25.949 --> 00:18:28.318
Newton is hospitalized
in serious condition


358
00:18:28.352 --> 00:18:31.389
and under heavy guard.

359
00:18:31.422 --> 00:18:33.857
We went up to Highland
Hospital and it


360
00:18:33.891 --> 00:18:37.928
looked like every police
in America was there.


361
00:18:37.961 --> 00:18:43.867
We didn't know for sure
if Huey was dead or alive.


362
00:18:43.901 --> 00:18:45.102
We didn't sleep that night.

363
00:18:45.134 --> 00:18:46.671
Nobody slept that
night, I don't think.


364
00:18:50.473 --> 00:18:51.908
As
he was handcuffed


365
00:18:51.941 --> 00:18:55.913
to a gurney going into surgery,
he was arrested for murder


366
00:18:55.945 --> 00:18:57.682
and expected to face execution.

367
00:19:01.184 --> 00:19:02.787
A lot of the other Panthers were

368
00:19:02.819 --> 00:19:07.157
in jail because of the protests
that they'd done in Sacramento,


369
00:19:07.191 --> 00:19:11.729
so Eldridge was the only
available spokesperson


370
00:19:11.761 --> 00:19:14.097
for the Black Panther Party.

371
00:19:14.131 --> 00:19:15.800
The
Black Panther Party


372
00:19:15.833 --> 00:19:19.336
demands that
Huey P. Newton be set free,


373
00:19:19.368 --> 00:19:21.805
and we wish to
make it very clear


374
00:19:21.838 --> 00:19:23.973
that if he is
not set free, there


375
00:19:24.007 --> 00:19:27.076
is little hope of
avoiding open, armed war


376
00:19:27.109 --> 00:19:31.181
on the streets of California
and sweeping across this nation.


377
00:19:31.214 --> 00:19:32.982
We said, well, 
Huey's in jail.

378
00:19:33.016 --> 00:19:34.351
He's facing the death penalty.

379
00:19:34.384 --> 00:19:36.420
What can we do?

380
00:19:36.452 --> 00:19:39.690
I think the initial slogan
was Huey must be set free.


381
00:19:39.722 --> 00:19:43.693
Eventually it got
shortened to free Huey.


382
00:19:43.727 --> 00:19:46.197
Black is beautiful.

383
00:19:46.230 --> 00:19:47.198
Free Huey!

384
00:19:47.230 --> 00:19:49.666
Set our warrior free.

385
00:19:49.700 --> 00:19:50.668
Free Huey!

386
00:19:50.701 --> 00:19:53.136
Black is beautiful.

387
00:19:53.170 --> 00:19:54.605
Free Huey!

388
00:19:54.637 --> 00:19:56.573
Set our warrior free.

389
00:19:56.606 --> 00:19:58.174
Free Huey!

390
00:19:58.208 --> 00:20:00.445
It became a huge movement.

391
00:20:03.814 --> 00:20:04.949
Free Huey!

392
00:20:04.981 --> 00:20:07.417
Black is beautiful.

393
00:20:07.451 --> 00:20:08.885
Free Huey!

394
00:20:08.919 --> 00:20:11.355
Set our warrior free.

395
00:20:11.387 --> 00:20:12.355
Free Huey!

396
00:20:12.388 --> 00:20:14.824
Black is beautiful.

397
00:20:14.857 --> 00:20:15.792
Free Huey!

398
00:20:15.826 --> 00:20:17.760
Set our warrior free.

399
00:20:17.794 --> 00:20:18.729
Free Huey!

400
00:20:18.761 --> 00:20:19.829
Today there

401
00:20:19.863 --> 00:20:21.398
were a number of free
Huey Newton rallies


402
00:20:21.431 --> 00:20:22.766
across the nation.

403
00:20:22.798 --> 00:20:26.403
You did not have to be a member
of the Black Panther Party.


404
00:20:26.435 --> 00:20:28.739
All you had to be
was a human being.


405
00:20:28.771 --> 00:20:32.275
People of all kinds took
up that cry, Free Huey.


406
00:20:41.785 --> 00:20:44.021
The Examiner
made a report back here


407
00:20:44.054 --> 00:20:46.857
in the last Sunday's paper
that we were anti-white,


408
00:20:46.890 --> 00:20:49.259
that we hold no bones...
this is a quote... hold


409
00:20:49.293 --> 00:20:52.263
no, pick no bones
about being anti-white.


410
00:20:52.296 --> 00:20:54.899
This is a bold faced lie.

411
00:20:54.932 --> 00:20:57.300
We don't hate nobody
because of their color.


412
00:20:57.334 --> 00:20:59.370
We hate oppression.

413
00:20:59.403 --> 00:21:04.107
We hate murder of black
people in our communities.


414
00:21:04.141 --> 00:21:05.875
The people just turned out.

415
00:21:05.909 --> 00:21:08.212
They wanted to help us, they
wanted to give us money,


416
00:21:08.245 --> 00:21:09.513
they wanted us to come speak.

417
00:21:09.546 --> 00:21:14.418
It was this gathering
of connection


418
00:21:14.451 --> 00:21:17.086
to the Black Panthers that
was different to before.


419
00:21:17.120 --> 00:21:20.758
We've
got to free Huey.


420
00:21:20.790 --> 00:21:24.694
We've got to free Huey.

421
00:21:24.728 --> 00:21:28.132
We've got to free Huey.

422
00:21:28.164 --> 00:21:30.567
We've got to free Huey.

423
00:21:30.601 --> 00:21:32.036
Everybody!

424
00:21:32.068 --> 00:21:34.971
We've got to free Huey.

425
00:21:35.005 --> 00:21:36.374
We've got to free Huey.

426
00:21:42.378 --> 00:21:46.616
We were a phenomenon... the way

427
00:21:46.650 --> 00:21:51.088
that we walked and
talked and dressed.


428
00:21:51.121 --> 00:21:51.756
We had swagger.

429
00:22:00.163 --> 00:22:02.298
It was a rhythm.

430
00:22:02.332 --> 00:22:04.902
It was a rhythm to how we spoke.

431
00:22:04.934 --> 00:22:06.703
It was a rhythm
to how we walked,


432
00:22:06.737 --> 00:22:08.605
and the people recognized it.

433
00:22:08.638 --> 00:22:11.574
We stood out.

434
00:22:11.607 --> 00:22:14.677
Outside of that, on the street,
they'd... ooh that's a butt ugly


435
00:22:14.711 --> 00:22:15.245
person.

436
00:22:15.278 --> 00:22:16.480
Ooh, they ugly.

437
00:22:16.512 --> 00:22:20.917
But in the Party it was just
something that gave them


438
00:22:20.951 --> 00:22:22.519
this tremendous sex appeal.

439
00:22:28.525 --> 00:22:30.928
The Panthers
didn't invent the idea of black


440
00:22:30.961 --> 00:22:32.229
is beautiful.

441
00:22:32.261 --> 00:22:35.531
People had started wearing
afros and dashikis...


442
00:22:35.565 --> 00:22:37.101
but one of the things
the Panthers did


443
00:22:37.134 --> 00:22:40.970
was that urban
black is beautiful,


444
00:22:41.003 --> 00:22:45.108
and that look just
blew people away.


445
00:22:45.142 --> 00:22:47.678
If you were a young
black man living in the city


446
00:22:47.711 --> 00:22:49.646
anywhere, you wanted
to be like this.


447
00:22:49.680 --> 00:22:52.115
You wanted to dress like this,
you wanted to act like this,


448
00:22:52.149 --> 00:22:53.384
you wanted to talk like this.

449
00:22:53.416 --> 00:22:54.584
You wanted to be this.

450
00:22:54.617 --> 00:22:56.452
It's a standard of
aggressiveness, of militance,


451
00:22:56.486 --> 00:23:00.758
of just forcefulness that's
the sort of standard we


452
00:23:00.790 --> 00:23:01.725
haven't had in the past.

453
00:23:09.231 --> 00:23:11.000
But figuratively
speaking, you're


454
00:23:11.034 --> 00:23:12.903
not about to become a Panther.

455
00:23:12.935 --> 00:23:13.870
No.

456
00:23:13.903 --> 00:23:15.739
Not today or
tomorrow, at any rate.


457
00:23:15.771 --> 00:23:17.040
Maybe the day after.

458
00:23:29.051 --> 00:23:31.421
This brother here,
myself, all of us


459
00:23:31.454 --> 00:23:32.955
were born with
our hair like this,


460
00:23:32.989 --> 00:23:35.558
and we just wear it like this.

461
00:23:35.592 --> 00:23:37.127
The reason for it,
you might say,


462
00:23:37.160 --> 00:23:39.797
is like a new awareness
among black people


463
00:23:39.829 --> 00:23:41.932
that their own
natural appearance...


464
00:23:41.964 --> 00:23:44.268
physical appearance,
is beautiful.


465
00:23:44.300 --> 00:23:46.470
Black people are aware now.

466
00:23:46.502 --> 00:23:47.538
They're proud of it.

467
00:23:47.570 --> 00:23:49.172
It's pleasing to them.

468
00:23:49.205 --> 00:23:49.839
Dig it?

469
00:23:49.873 --> 00:23:51.040
Isn't it beautiful?

470
00:23:51.074 --> 00:23:52.042
All right.

471
00:24:06.957 --> 00:24:08.425
You're

472
00:24:08.458 --> 00:24:12.062
talking about people who
are teenagers... 17, 18, 19,


473
00:24:12.095 --> 00:24:15.399
20... that's the bulk of
the Panthers are teenagers.


474
00:24:15.432 --> 00:24:17.835
So the fact that
we were so young


475
00:24:17.867 --> 00:24:20.169
and the fact that this
hadn't happened before... I'm


476
00:24:20.202 --> 00:24:23.706
not certain that we
recognized how startling it


477
00:24:23.740 --> 00:24:25.209
looked to other people.

478
00:24:28.711 --> 00:24:30.146
Dear Mr. Newton,

479
00:24:30.180 --> 00:24:33.917
I'm a 13-year-old black girl and
I want to be a Black Panther.


480
00:24:33.950 --> 00:24:36.120
I wish you would fill me in.

481
00:24:36.153 --> 00:24:38.822
Does it matter what
your religion is?


482
00:24:38.855 --> 00:24:41.959
What are some qualifications
to be a Black Panther?


483
00:24:41.991 --> 00:24:45.695
PS... write me back personally.

484
00:24:45.729 --> 00:24:47.131
I was taught

485
00:24:47.163 --> 00:24:50.099
to be proper... behave yourself.

486
00:24:50.133 --> 00:24:52.502
You're going out in
public, to always know


487
00:24:52.536 --> 00:24:55.139
that the white
man was listening.


488
00:24:55.172 --> 00:24:58.307
With the Black Panthers
coming to the scene,


489
00:24:58.341 --> 00:25:02.513
it was just a completely
different message.


490
00:25:02.546 --> 00:25:05.849
As a 12-year-old,
you know... what?


491
00:25:05.882 --> 00:25:10.320
You had this whole
other portrayal of self,


492
00:25:10.353 --> 00:25:12.022
and just digging it.

493
00:25:17.928 --> 00:25:20.364
Photographers took advantage.

494
00:25:20.396 --> 00:25:21.664
I mean, they took our pictures.

495
00:25:21.698 --> 00:25:22.966
They put them on newspapers.

496
00:25:22.999 --> 00:25:24.567
They put them on magazines.

497
00:25:24.601 --> 00:25:27.905
And that look that we
projected... you know,


498
00:25:27.938 --> 00:25:30.374
the big Afro, the
leather jacket,


499
00:25:30.406 --> 00:25:32.675
the shades... that became a hit.

500
00:25:36.078 --> 00:25:40.650
And obviously, photographers
were drawn to the Panthers.


501
00:25:40.683 --> 00:25:43.487
Well, we hear a great deal
about the Black Panthers.


502
00:25:43.519 --> 00:25:44.453
Black Panthers.

503
00:25:44.487 --> 00:25:45.154
Black Panthers.

504
00:25:45.188 --> 00:25:46.223
The Black Panthers.

505
00:25:46.256 --> 00:25:49.526
The Black Panthers
were absolutely unique.


506
00:25:49.558 --> 00:25:50.626
The Black Panthers.

507
00:25:50.660 --> 00:25:51.628
The Black Panthers.

508
00:25:51.661 --> 00:25:52.763
Black Panthers.

509
00:25:52.796 --> 00:25:53.462
The Black Panther Party.

510
00:25:53.496 --> 00:25:54.565
Black Panther movement.

511
00:25:54.597 --> 00:25:55.566
Black Panther Party.

512
00:25:55.598 --> 00:25:57.134
Black Panthers.

513
00:25:57.166 --> 00:26:00.603
I think the Black Panthers
really understood the media.


514
00:26:00.636 --> 00:26:01.804
They knew what we were after.

515
00:26:01.837 --> 00:26:06.576
They knew what we
were focusing on.


516
00:26:06.609 --> 00:26:08.044
The Panthers has amounted to...

517
00:26:08.077 --> 00:26:09.278
The Black Panther Party.

518
00:26:09.311 --> 00:26:10.680
Many people know
of the Panthers.


519
00:26:10.713 --> 00:26:13.916
You might say
that we exploited the Black


520
00:26:13.950 --> 00:26:14.951
Panthers.

521
00:26:14.984 --> 00:26:16.686
But I think there's
a lot of evidence


522
00:26:16.720 --> 00:26:20.723
that they used us
to their advantage.


523
00:26:20.757 --> 00:26:24.795
They were able to
establish their legitimacy


524
00:26:24.827 --> 00:26:25.995
as a voice of protest.

525
00:26:26.028 --> 00:26:27.897
The Chairman of the
Black Panther Party.


526
00:26:27.931 --> 00:26:29.333
And here he is.

527
00:26:35.838 --> 00:26:37.974
We have a film of your
breakfast program.


528
00:26:38.008 --> 00:26:39.710
Is this without sound also?

529
00:26:39.742 --> 00:26:40.977
Yeah.

530
00:26:41.010 --> 00:26:41.478
I think so.

531
00:26:41.510 --> 00:26:42.511
All right.

532
00:26:42.545 --> 00:26:43.513
Would you... would
you comment on this?


533
00:26:43.546 --> 00:26:43.948
Yes.

534
00:26:50.487 --> 00:26:51.922
Yeah, this

535
00:26:51.954 --> 00:26:54.891
is a free breakfast
for children program,


536
00:26:54.924 --> 00:26:57.293
and they're preparing the food
there early in the morning.


537
00:26:57.326 --> 00:26:59.528
It's about two hours
work in the morning.


538
00:26:59.561 --> 00:27:01.931
These party members primarily
set this whole program up,


539
00:27:01.964 --> 00:27:04.233
and then we get involved as
many of the community people


540
00:27:04.267 --> 00:27:07.104
as we can.

541
00:27:07.136 --> 00:27:09.605
Who all wants tea?

542
00:27:09.638 --> 00:27:11.107
Put more tea in, little brother.

543
00:27:11.141 --> 00:27:12.242
Come on it, little sister.

544
00:27:12.275 --> 00:27:15.211
Y'all can sit down and
get something to eat.


545
00:27:15.245 --> 00:27:16.780
Studies
came out saying


546
00:27:16.813 --> 00:27:19.383
that children that didn't have
a good breakfast in the morning


547
00:27:19.415 --> 00:27:22.184
were less attentive at school
and less inclined to do well


548
00:27:22.218 --> 00:27:23.854
and suffered from fatigue.

549
00:27:23.886 --> 00:27:27.323
I mean, there was all
sorts of scientific reasons


550
00:27:27.356 --> 00:27:30.927
to have a good breakfast
in the morning.


551
00:27:30.961 --> 00:27:34.463
And we just simply
took that information,


552
00:27:34.497 --> 00:27:37.468
and a program was developed
serving breakfast to children.


553
00:27:40.836 --> 00:27:43.673
After my
father came home from Vietnam


554
00:27:43.707 --> 00:27:46.443
and was discharged from the
army and couldn't get work,


555
00:27:46.476 --> 00:27:48.745
we were going through
a very hard time.


556
00:27:48.778 --> 00:27:52.649
Food was kind of... you know,
just the everyday necessities


557
00:27:52.682 --> 00:27:54.183
were hard.

558
00:27:54.217 --> 00:27:56.987
I was embarrassed to
go, but when you went,


559
00:27:57.019 --> 00:28:00.790
you know, kids are all laughing,
and then all of a sudden


560
00:28:00.824 --> 00:28:03.125
the stigma... or
whatever you thought


561
00:28:03.159 --> 00:28:06.095
was the stigma... went
away, and you really


562
00:28:06.128 --> 00:28:09.832
got to see that yes, this is
what the Black Panthers are.


563
00:28:15.805 --> 00:28:18.174
We were showing
love for our people.


564
00:28:18.208 --> 00:28:20.711
You know, if you have a
child, if you'd know that hey,


565
00:28:20.743 --> 00:28:23.946
these men and women are going
to feed my child in the morning,


566
00:28:23.980 --> 00:28:24.847
that's a big deal.

567
00:28:31.755 --> 00:28:34.157
The breakfast
program actually really caught


568
00:28:34.190 --> 00:28:35.124
on.

569
00:28:35.157 --> 00:28:37.693
It served about

570
00:28:37.727 --> 00:28:40.998
to young people in 19
different communities.


571
00:28:41.030 --> 00:28:43.399
So it wasn't a fly
by night thing.


572
00:28:43.432 --> 00:28:45.836
It really, actually was
making a difference.


573
00:28:55.211 --> 00:28:57.748
Just at the moment
that the Panthers are turning


574
00:28:57.780 --> 00:29:00.549
toward survival programs...
towards free breakfast


575
00:29:00.583 --> 00:29:03.086
programs, free clinics,
and free food programs that


576
00:29:03.118 --> 00:29:05.121
will help them reconnect
with the black community


577
00:29:05.154 --> 00:29:08.959
and build their membership,
and repudiating this earlier


578
00:29:08.991 --> 00:29:12.095
advocacy of armed self
defense and police patrols...


579
00:29:12.127 --> 00:29:14.263
J Edgar Hoover
attacks the Panthers.


580
00:29:19.368 --> 00:29:23.639
Hoover saw any form of
black organizing as a threat


581
00:29:23.672 --> 00:29:26.442
to the status quo as he saw it.

582
00:29:26.476 --> 00:29:28.645
Change that would have
involved equality,


583
00:29:28.678 --> 00:29:30.747
that would have put power
in black people's hands,


584
00:29:30.779 --> 00:29:34.683
was very much a
threat to Hoover.


585
00:29:34.717 --> 00:29:37.821
He started something
called COINTELPRO,


586
00:29:37.854 --> 00:29:41.557
directed against what he called
black nationalist hate groups.


587
00:29:41.591 --> 00:29:45.295
COINTELPRO was the abbreviation
of Counter


588
00:29:45.327 --> 00:29:47.631
Intelligence Program.

589
00:29:47.663 --> 00:29:49.799
The purpose of this new

590
00:29:49.833 --> 00:29:54.638
counterintelligence endeavour is
to expose, disrupt, misdirect,


591
00:29:54.671 --> 00:29:57.974
discredit or otherwise
neutralize the activities


592
00:29:58.007 --> 00:30:00.544
of black nationalists.

593
00:30:00.576 --> 00:30:02.144
Neutralize could

594
00:30:02.178 --> 00:30:05.082
mean making somebody
an informant


595
00:30:05.115 --> 00:30:08.684
or putting somebody in jail
or having somebody killed.


596
00:30:13.088 --> 00:30:18.095
Hoover was sending
letters to various offices


597
00:30:18.127 --> 00:30:21.297
almost on a weekly basis
to come up with new ideas


598
00:30:21.330 --> 00:30:24.634
to go after members of
the Black Panther Party.


599
00:30:30.240 --> 00:30:34.344
245 of the

600
00:30:34.376 --> 00:30:37.346
were against the Black Panthers.

601
00:30:37.380 --> 00:30:40.717
One of the mandates was do
not make this program public.


602
00:30:40.749 --> 00:30:44.887
Do not tell anybody
that it exists.


603
00:30:44.921 --> 00:30:47.624
FBI has
a memo that states


604
00:30:47.656 --> 00:30:52.595
the objectives of
counterintelligence operations.


605
00:30:52.628 --> 00:30:55.164
One is to prevent
the rise of what


606
00:30:55.198 --> 00:30:58.368
they call the black messiah... a
single charismatic leader that


607
00:30:58.401 --> 00:31:00.537
could unify the movement.

608
00:31:00.569 --> 00:31:05.241
They want to prevent the appeal
of radical political movement


609
00:31:05.275 --> 00:31:09.513
to black youth, and
they wanted to isolate


610
00:31:09.546 --> 00:31:12.516
these groups to prevent them
from gaining respectability


611
00:31:12.548 --> 00:31:13.916
in the black community.

612
00:31:13.950 --> 00:31:18.688
And they were very explicit
in stating these goals.


613
00:31:18.720 --> 00:31:20.624
We were followed every day.

614
00:31:20.656 --> 00:31:21.824
We were harassed.

615
00:31:21.857 --> 00:31:24.426
Our phones were tapped.

616
00:31:24.460 --> 00:31:27.264
Our families were harassed.

617
00:31:27.297 --> 00:31:30.967
My parents were both
visited by the FBI.


618
00:31:30.999 --> 00:31:33.170
We must create suspicion

619
00:31:33.202 --> 00:31:35.704
with respect to their
respective spouses,


620
00:31:35.738 --> 00:31:37.974
and your imagination
and resourcefulness


621
00:31:38.007 --> 00:31:41.144
must be employed in order for
the Bureau to be successful.


622
00:31:43.845 --> 00:31:47.017
They would
send letters to my wife,


623
00:31:47.049 --> 00:31:49.185
and the letters
would say that Landon


624
00:31:49.219 --> 00:31:51.688
is sleeping with this woman
or sleeping with that woman


625
00:31:51.720 --> 00:31:54.223
or sleeping with
the other women.


626
00:31:54.257 --> 00:31:57.193
Then when I got arrested,
the FBI came to me and said,


627
00:31:57.227 --> 00:31:57.994
ha, look.

628
00:31:58.027 --> 00:31:59.196
We've got all this evidence.

629
00:31:59.229 --> 00:32:01.965
All these people are gonna
flip and turn on you.


630
00:32:01.998 --> 00:32:04.567
We're gonna execute you,
because we got you now.


631
00:32:04.601 --> 00:32:05.969
We're going to execute you.

632
00:32:06.001 --> 00:32:14.310
But if you will be an informant
for us, then we'll let you go.


633
00:32:14.344 --> 00:32:16.046
My
recruitment by the FBI


634
00:32:16.078 --> 00:32:19.448
was very efficient...
very simple, really.


635
00:32:19.481 --> 00:32:23.653
I'd stolen a car and went
joyriding over the state limit,


636
00:32:23.685 --> 00:32:27.122
and they had a potential
case against me,


637
00:32:27.155 --> 00:32:30.926
and I was looking for an
opportunity to work it out.


638
00:32:30.960 --> 00:32:33.797
And a couple of months
later that opportunity


639
00:32:33.829 --> 00:32:38.067
came when the FBI agent
Roy Mitchell asked me to,


640
00:32:38.101 --> 00:32:41.571
go down to the local office
of the Black Panther Party


641
00:32:41.604 --> 00:32:45.174
and try to, gain membership.

642
00:32:45.208 --> 00:32:47.777
The FBI wanted to
destroy the Panthers.


643
00:32:47.809 --> 00:32:52.615
They absolutely saw the
Panthers as the vanguard


644
00:32:52.649 --> 00:32:58.955
of a very, very threatening and
violent revolutionary movement.


645
00:32:58.988 --> 00:33:02.726
They absolutely wanted this
organization to be destroyed.


646
00:33:05.495 --> 00:33:10.367
The FBI was coming around
my mother-in-law and my wife,


647
00:33:10.400 --> 00:33:14.838
and for me to stop
that kind of activity,


648
00:33:14.871 --> 00:33:17.941
I stopped going home,
and a lot of other people


649
00:33:17.973 --> 00:33:21.845
did also, to protect
their families.


650
00:33:21.877 --> 00:33:24.880
You could kind of in a sense say
that we abandoned our families


651
00:33:24.913 --> 00:33:25.749
for the Panther Party.

652
00:33:28.351 --> 00:33:30.287
You might have a
three bedroom apartment


653
00:33:30.319 --> 00:33:32.489
that might have 10 Panthers
staying there and sharing


654
00:33:32.521 --> 00:33:33.656
bedrooms.

655
00:33:33.690 --> 00:33:36.459
The living room was
basically also a bedroom.


656
00:33:36.491 --> 00:33:38.427
We
called them Panther pads.


657
00:33:38.461 --> 00:33:41.096
Somebody would be
on 24 hour security.


658
00:33:41.130 --> 00:33:43.933
Somebody was responsible
for cleaning the place.


659
00:33:43.966 --> 00:33:48.638
Often it was a rotating
list of responsibilities.


660
00:33:48.671 --> 00:33:50.907
It was a sense of
community that we created.


661
00:34:11.127 --> 00:34:13.496
The rank and file was
the every day members


662
00:34:13.529 --> 00:34:16.766
that did the daily
work of the Party.


663
00:34:16.799 --> 00:34:18.567
They the ones that
made the Party,


664
00:34:18.600 --> 00:34:21.037
the back breakers, the ones
you put all the work on.


665
00:34:30.078 --> 00:34:32.381
Panthers realized
we have to live together


666
00:34:32.415 --> 00:34:34.284
to protect one
another, and we have


667
00:34:34.317 --> 00:34:38.388
to also be committed to
this thing, to this cause,


668
00:34:38.421 --> 00:34:42.125
to this movement,

669
00:34:42.158 --> 00:34:43.860
The rank and file...

670
00:34:43.892 --> 00:34:46.161
whatever orders that came
down from our captains


671
00:34:46.194 --> 00:34:49.665
and lieutenants, we did
that, because that spirit was


672
00:34:49.698 --> 00:34:53.602
in us to stay in this
movement to our death,


673
00:34:53.636 --> 00:34:55.372
or if it meant going to jail.

674
00:34:55.404 --> 00:34:57.640
So whatever they told
us to do, we did it.


675
00:35:13.622 --> 00:35:15.557
I was in
labor, cooking breakfast


676
00:35:15.591 --> 00:35:19.328
for the breakfast program.

677
00:35:19.361 --> 00:35:23.465
So I was between contractions
flipping pancakes.


678
00:35:23.499 --> 00:35:25.234
I would spend all the day

679
00:35:25.267 --> 00:35:28.637
answering the phones, even after
I had my son, when I came back


680
00:35:28.671 --> 00:35:29.906
to work.

681
00:35:29.939 --> 00:35:31.674
I used to have to jump him
up and down really heavy,


682
00:35:31.707 --> 00:35:33.176
because it just
wouldn't stop crying


683
00:35:33.209 --> 00:35:34.310
as I'm answering the phone.

684
00:35:34.343 --> 00:35:35.310
You name it.

685
00:35:35.343 --> 00:35:37.880
I cleaned freezers
with a toothpick.


686
00:35:37.913 --> 00:35:40.049
And that's how I'd answer
the phone... Black Panther


687
00:35:40.082 --> 00:35:41.350
Party national headquarters.

688
00:35:41.383 --> 00:35:42.351
Black Panther Party
central headquarters.


689
00:35:42.384 --> 00:35:42.919
Can I help you?

690
00:36:00.136 --> 00:36:01.504
Dear Huey, when

691
00:36:01.537 --> 00:36:04.207
I joined the party I was
thrilled about becoming part


692
00:36:04.240 --> 00:36:06.843
of an organization that
believes in the quality of men


693
00:36:06.875 --> 00:36:08.578
and women.

694
00:36:08.611 --> 00:36:11.980
It bothers me that there are
brothers who still view women


695
00:36:12.013 --> 00:36:14.349
as sexual objects.

696
00:36:14.383 --> 00:36:16.618
We should have no men in
the Black Panther Party


697
00:36:16.651 --> 00:36:19.522
who feel this way... or
women, for that matter.


698
00:36:22.191 --> 00:36:24.526
One of the
ironies of the Black Panther


699
00:36:24.560 --> 00:36:28.832
Party is that the image is
the black male with the jacket


700
00:36:28.865 --> 00:36:32.267
and the gun, but the reality
is the majority of the rank


701
00:36:32.301 --> 00:36:35.705
and file at, by the end
of the '60s are women.


702
00:36:35.738 --> 00:36:38.408
Everybody knows that all the
people don't have liberties,


703
00:36:38.441 --> 00:36:40.477
all the people
don't have freedom,


704
00:36:40.509 --> 00:36:42.345
all the people
don't have justice,


705
00:36:42.377 --> 00:36:45.013
and all the people don't have
power, so that means none of us


706
00:36:45.046 --> 00:36:47.082
do.

707
00:36:47.116 --> 00:36:49.018
The Black
Panther Party certainly


708
00:36:49.051 --> 00:36:52.221
had a chauvinist
tone, and so we tried


709
00:36:52.254 --> 00:36:55.959
to change some of the
clear gender roles


710
00:36:55.991 --> 00:37:02.231
so that women had guns and men
cooked breakfast for children.


711
00:37:02.265 --> 00:37:03.165
Did we overcome it?

712
00:37:03.198 --> 00:37:04.334
Of course we didn't.

713
00:37:04.366 --> 00:37:06.134
As I like to say, we
didn't get these brothers


714
00:37:06.167 --> 00:37:08.270
from revolutionary heaven.

715
00:37:08.303 --> 00:37:10.205
"Black Panther Newspaper"?

716
00:37:10.238 --> 00:37:11.106
Panther paper!

717
00:37:21.317 --> 00:37:23.586
The paper was
the lifeblood of the Party.


718
00:37:23.618 --> 00:37:24.887
That's why we survived.

719
00:37:24.921 --> 00:37:27.957
We sold the papers
at $0.25 back then.


720
00:37:27.990 --> 00:37:30.058
It cost maybe $0.12 to print it.

721
00:37:30.091 --> 00:37:32.361
The other 12 and 1/2 cent
went to the various chapters


722
00:37:32.395 --> 00:37:33.796
and branches.

723
00:37:33.828 --> 00:37:35.698
That's how we
basically survived.


724
00:37:35.730 --> 00:37:37.232
The Party paper went

725
00:37:37.265 --> 00:37:40.802
places Party members would never
get to go to, and be reaching


726
00:37:40.836 --> 00:37:42.471
people we would never see.

727
00:37:42.504 --> 00:37:44.907
But the paper get there
some kind of way or other.


728
00:37:44.941 --> 00:37:47.410
So it was very important
to get the paper out.


729
00:37:47.442 --> 00:37:50.046
Los Angeles, 2,850.

730
00:37:50.078 --> 00:37:51.346
New Haven, 3,000.

731
00:37:51.379 --> 00:37:53.649
When we were
loading boxes or bundling


732
00:37:53.683 --> 00:37:54.817
papers or whatever
we were doing,


733
00:37:54.850 --> 00:37:56.486
we did it in an
assembly line fashion,


734
00:37:56.518 --> 00:37:58.787
and we would just start
singing, you know it.


735
00:37:58.821 --> 00:38:01.824
Ain't no mountain high enough.

736
00:38:01.857 --> 00:38:05.595
Ain't no valley low
enough to keep me


737
00:38:05.627 --> 00:38:10.165
from getting this paper to
you... or whatever we would do.


738
00:38:10.198 --> 00:38:12.034
We would change the
lyric just a little bit.


739
00:38:12.067 --> 00:38:13.703
You know...
It's your thing.


740
00:38:13.736 --> 00:38:15.337
Do what you want to do.

741
00:38:15.370 --> 00:38:18.307
Why do you keep tell me
what the... and then


742
00:38:18.341 --> 00:38:20.676
we'd say what to do.

743
00:38:20.709 --> 00:38:21.944
Panther paper!

744
00:38:21.977 --> 00:38:26.548
This man needs some help
with human beings.


745
00:38:26.582 --> 00:38:30.185
In the paper
everything came together.


746
00:38:30.218 --> 00:38:32.688
We had the platform... the ten
point platform was in there.


747
00:38:32.721 --> 00:38:34.189
You know, it was
the first thing you


748
00:38:34.223 --> 00:38:35.491
see when you open up the paper.

749
00:38:35.524 --> 00:38:37.759
We want an end to the
robbery by the white man


750
00:38:37.792 --> 00:38:38.961
of our black community.

751
00:38:38.995 --> 00:38:40.797
That's what we talking
about, like number 3.


752
00:38:40.830 --> 00:38:43.466
Number 4, we want decent housing
fit to shelter human beings.


753
00:38:43.499 --> 00:38:44.033
You dig?

754
00:38:44.066 --> 00:38:46.134
I can dig that.

755
00:38:46.167 --> 00:38:49.071
And it explained who we were
and what... what we were about,


756
00:38:49.104 --> 00:38:50.105
what our goals were.

757
00:38:50.138 --> 00:38:51.240
Tell me, ma'am.

758
00:38:51.272 --> 00:38:53.041
Do you read the Black
Panther Party newspaper?


759
00:38:53.075 --> 00:38:53.843
Yes I do.

760
00:38:53.875 --> 00:38:54.776
Why?

761
00:38:54.810 --> 00:38:57.080
Because I'm black
and I'm proud.


762
00:38:57.113 --> 00:38:59.082
What do you
like best about the paper?


763
00:38:59.115 --> 00:39:01.283
Because they're a proud
people and I love them.


764
00:39:12.328 --> 00:39:14.297
For me
there was only one reason


765
00:39:14.330 --> 00:39:16.432
to read the Panther
newspaper, and that was


766
00:39:16.464 --> 00:39:19.067
to see Emory's illustrations.

767
00:39:19.100 --> 00:39:22.537
His paintings, his
caricatures, his illustrations


768
00:39:22.571 --> 00:39:24.540
literally gave us the story.

769
00:39:33.716 --> 00:39:36.618
Well to me, you
would respond to the artwork


770
00:39:36.651 --> 00:39:40.956
because it was a reflection
of them in the artwork itself,


771
00:39:40.990 --> 00:39:43.459
because you were putting them
on the stage as the characters


772
00:39:43.491 --> 00:39:46.129
and the heroes in the images.

773
00:39:46.162 --> 00:39:48.598
They could see their brother,
or they could see their uncle


774
00:39:48.631 --> 00:39:49.432
in the images.

775
00:39:58.540 --> 00:40:00.977
Through the breakfast programs,
through the other programs


776
00:40:01.009 --> 00:40:02.778
that we had, the
health clinics, people


777
00:40:02.812 --> 00:40:05.348
come in and talk about how
they can't pay their bills


778
00:40:05.381 --> 00:40:11.553
or they need child care... that
teardrop symbolized that pain


779
00:40:11.587 --> 00:40:14.023
that I observed.

780
00:40:14.055 --> 00:40:15.390
Even through their
pain there was


781
00:40:15.424 --> 00:40:18.194
this strength and
determination and conviction


782
00:40:18.227 --> 00:40:20.363
to still battle on.

783
00:40:20.395 --> 00:40:24.133
So we're trying to put that
into the artwork itself.


784
00:40:29.839 --> 00:40:32.041
Emory
was our social realism.


785
00:40:32.073 --> 00:40:36.511
He gave you a sense of
bravery, resilience, courage,


786
00:40:36.544 --> 00:40:38.447
and most of all, beauty.

787
00:40:38.480 --> 00:40:40.049
That was what I
loved about Emory.


788
00:40:50.558 --> 00:40:55.163
It was Huey and Bobby's idea
to draw a pig drawing that


789
00:40:55.196 --> 00:40:58.567
would symbolize the police.

790
00:40:58.600 --> 00:41:03.905
So the first pig I did
was one on the four hoofs.


791
00:41:03.939 --> 00:41:05.607
It just came to me
one night, why don't I


792
00:41:05.640 --> 00:41:07.843
stand it up on two hoofs?

793
00:41:07.877 --> 00:41:10.246
I'll put a bandolier...
a gun bandolier


794
00:41:10.279 --> 00:41:14.317
on with the holster and a
badge and the flies around it,


795
00:41:14.350 --> 00:41:17.018
and that became the
symbol... icon of the pig.


796
00:41:17.051 --> 00:41:18.687
It took on a life of its own.

797
00:41:18.721 --> 00:41:21.090
Revolution has come.

798
00:41:21.122 --> 00:41:22.090
Off the pigs!

799
00:41:22.124 --> 00:41:24.993
Time to pick up the guns.

800
00:41:25.026 --> 00:41:27.395
Off the pigs!

801
00:41:27.428 --> 00:41:29.865
That rhetoric
didn't bother us when


802
00:41:29.899 --> 00:41:33.368
it was spoken by the Panthers.

803
00:41:33.401 --> 00:41:36.338
Power to the people.

804
00:41:36.372 --> 00:41:37.006
Off the pigs!

805
00:41:37.038 --> 00:41:39.341
Power to the people.

806
00:41:39.375 --> 00:41:40.476
Off the pigs!

807
00:41:40.508 --> 00:41:44.713
But when it was picked
up by college students,


808
00:41:44.747 --> 00:41:49.252
them saying it, that
definitely bothered us.


809
00:41:49.285 --> 00:41:53.189
Power to
the people Off the pigs!


810
00:41:53.221 --> 00:41:55.658
Power to the people.

811
00:41:55.691 --> 00:41:57.727
Off the pigs!

812
00:41:57.759 --> 00:42:01.497
I was a sergeant
patrolling in the projects,


813
00:42:01.529 --> 00:42:05.066
and there was the
cutest little girl.


814
00:42:05.100 --> 00:42:07.837
So I stopped to say hello,
and I said hi, honey.


815
00:42:07.870 --> 00:42:08.971
How are you doing today.

816
00:42:09.004 --> 00:42:12.341
And she looked at me and
she said, fuck you, pig.


817
00:42:12.374 --> 00:42:14.810
And I thought, we
have lost it, man.


818
00:42:14.843 --> 00:42:16.345
We have flat lost it.

819
00:42:19.415 --> 00:42:21.017
Anybody that criticized

820
00:42:21.049 --> 00:42:24.653
the police, especially that
didn't have fear of saying it,


821
00:42:24.687 --> 00:42:27.022
probably made the police angry.

822
00:42:34.897 --> 00:42:36.566
It was us against them.

823
00:42:36.598 --> 00:42:37.533
That became the theme.

824
00:42:41.002 --> 00:42:43.104
We have
seen the pig on the scene.


825
00:42:43.138 --> 00:42:44.406
We know what he's like.

826
00:42:44.439 --> 00:42:46.875
We know what he's capable
of... just being a damn pig,


827
00:42:46.908 --> 00:42:50.712
oinking and beating
and walking the street.


828
00:42:50.745 --> 00:42:53.148
The police
must be brought under control


829
00:42:53.182 --> 00:42:54.950
by any means
necessary, including


830
00:42:54.984 --> 00:42:56.118
through force of arms.

831
00:42:56.151 --> 00:42:59.087
These racist, gestapo
pigs have to stop


832
00:42:59.120 --> 00:43:01.523
brutalizing our community or
we're going to take up guns,


833
00:43:01.557 --> 00:43:03.192
we're going to drive them out.

834
00:43:03.225 --> 00:43:05.161
That tendency to keep

835
00:43:05.194 --> 00:43:07.797
escalating the
rhetoric... that was


836
00:43:07.830 --> 00:43:09.565
a major part of the
growth of the party,


837
00:43:09.598 --> 00:43:11.834
but it was also a
destructive force,


838
00:43:11.866 --> 00:43:13.836
because you were
always upping the ante.


839
00:43:13.868 --> 00:43:16.805
I say
guns, pick up the guns,


840
00:43:16.839 --> 00:43:20.308
pick up the guns and
put the pigs on the run.


841
00:43:20.341 --> 00:43:21.810
Pick up the guns.

842
00:43:21.843 --> 00:43:24.279
Boom, boom,

843
00:43:24.312 --> 00:43:26.816
It brought
all the repression down on them


844
00:43:26.848 --> 00:43:29.852
before they were
prepared to handle it.


845
00:43:29.884 --> 00:43:32.821
I just want to deal with
black, and black liberation.


846
00:43:32.854 --> 00:43:34.990
My sin is picking
up my damn gun...


847
00:43:35.024 --> 00:43:38.160
and I'm a mother...
having my baby


848
00:43:38.192 --> 00:43:40.196
in one hand, my
gun in the other,


849
00:43:40.229 --> 00:43:42.999
and then I'm here motherfuckers
to get what's mine.


850
00:43:51.073 --> 00:43:52.441
The
voice that called


851
00:43:52.473 --> 00:43:55.377
for justice and brotherhood
has been stilled.


852
00:43:55.410 --> 00:44:00.448
Men of all races now must
join together in this hour


853
00:44:00.482 --> 00:44:03.052
to deny violence its
victory and to fulfill


854
00:44:03.084 --> 00:44:04.052
the vision of brotherhood.

855
00:44:10.825 --> 00:44:12.894
The effect of the
death of Martin Luther


856
00:44:12.928 --> 00:44:15.665
King on the Panthers was
overwhelming in the sense


857
00:44:15.698 --> 00:44:22.104
that once King was
assassinated, and the way


858
00:44:22.136 --> 00:44:28.410
he was assassinated so publicly,
it shattered many, many people.


859
00:44:30.779 --> 00:44:33.049
They'd killed
their last chance for me


860
00:44:33.082 --> 00:44:35.051
to be peaceful with them.

861
00:44:35.084 --> 00:44:38.587
They'd killed their last
chance for negotiation.


862
00:44:38.620 --> 00:44:40.823
They killed the man
who walked through hell


863
00:44:40.855 --> 00:44:45.127
to try to get along with
you, and you kill him?


864
00:44:45.160 --> 00:44:47.529
That was our champion.

865
00:44:47.562 --> 00:44:50.865
You killed whatever
hope I had in you,


866
00:44:50.899 --> 00:44:53.636
and I have no more
use for you... none.


867
00:45:07.116 --> 00:45:08.651
I believe that there

868
00:45:08.683 --> 00:45:12.520
was a decision made that
some response on the part


869
00:45:12.553 --> 00:45:14.256
of the Black Panther
Party has to be


870
00:45:14.288 --> 00:45:17.125
made to what happened to King.

871
00:45:17.158 --> 00:45:18.493
Eldridge Cleaver was

872
00:45:18.526 --> 00:45:21.629
worried that if the Panthers
didn't take decisive action


873
00:45:21.662 --> 00:45:23.465
they would cease
to be the vanguard.


874
00:45:23.499 --> 00:45:27.370
So we had this idea of actually
actively attacking the police.


875
00:45:30.138 --> 00:45:32.207
He goes and he approaches
members of the Party


876
00:45:32.241 --> 00:45:35.811
in Oakland, and all of the older
people refused to participate.


877
00:45:35.843 --> 00:45:37.746
They knew that this
would be suicide.


878
00:45:37.779 --> 00:45:40.281
But the youngest member of the
party, little Bobby Hutton,


879
00:45:40.314 --> 00:45:44.220
decides to follow
Eldridge into battle.


880
00:45:44.252 --> 00:45:46.654
Little Bobby called me...
Big Man,


881
00:45:46.687 --> 00:45:48.023
I need a weapon.

882
00:45:50.792 --> 00:45:55.765
I gave him a Winchester 12-gauge
pump shotgun that I had,


883
00:45:55.797 --> 00:46:01.069
and I told him, well, be
careful out there, you know.


884
00:46:01.102 --> 00:46:02.704
Watch yourself.

885
00:46:02.738 --> 00:46:07.308
And he said OK, I
will, and he left.


886
00:46:07.341 --> 00:46:11.479
And then first thing
in the morning, I,


887
00:46:11.513 --> 00:46:12.748
have the radio on.

888
00:46:12.781 --> 00:46:14.150
The Oakland
police stated


889
00:46:14.183 --> 00:46:16.485
that they were fired upon
during a routine investigation


890
00:46:16.517 --> 00:46:20.422
into a suspicious person, and
after a short search cornered


891
00:46:20.455 --> 00:46:24.626
Hutton and Eldridge Cleaver in
the basement of a nearby house.


892
00:46:24.660 --> 00:46:27.029
A tear
gas canister blew up,


893
00:46:27.062 --> 00:46:30.366
and the basement they were
hiding in caught on fire.


894
00:46:30.399 --> 00:46:32.401
They decided they didn't
want to burn to death.


895
00:46:32.433 --> 00:46:34.669
They would rather surrender.

896
00:46:34.703 --> 00:46:37.740
Eldridge told Bobby Hutton
to take off all your clothes


897
00:46:37.772 --> 00:46:40.008
so they can't see you're
concealing a weapon.


898
00:46:40.042 --> 00:46:42.578
When you surrender,
take off everything.


899
00:46:42.611 --> 00:46:47.049
But Bobby was embarrassed,
and he just took off his shirt


900
00:46:47.082 --> 00:46:48.051
and he kept on his pants.

901
00:46:50.685 --> 00:46:52.388
Bobby Hutton came
out with his hands


902
00:46:52.421 --> 00:46:56.725
in the air... first member
who walked out of the house


903
00:46:56.758 --> 00:46:57.759
and was gunned down.

904
00:47:03.232 --> 00:47:05.201
My heart sank.

905
00:47:05.234 --> 00:47:10.973
He was only 17 years old,
and one of the first people


906
00:47:11.006 --> 00:47:13.408
to get killed in the
party, and so young.


907
00:47:16.712 --> 00:47:20.015
In essence, I felt
that I went out and got


908
00:47:20.047 --> 00:47:22.951
my little brother killed.

909
00:47:22.984 --> 00:47:27.355
What if I'd not
given him the weapon?


910
00:47:27.388 --> 00:47:32.561
Those are some of the demons
that, were in my closet.


911
00:47:36.732 --> 00:47:40.503
Shot down like a common
animal, he died a warrior


912
00:47:40.535 --> 00:47:43.371
for black liberation.

913
00:47:43.404 --> 00:47:47.042
In the name of brotherhood
and survival, remember Bobby.


914
00:47:47.075 --> 00:47:51.980
That could have been
my son lying there,


915
00:47:52.013 --> 00:47:55.783
and I'm going to do
as much as I can.


916
00:47:55.817 --> 00:48:01.657
I'm going to start right now
to inform white people of what


917
00:48:01.689 --> 00:48:03.691
they don't know.

918
00:48:03.725 --> 00:48:07.328
For the Black Panther Party,
it was crisis and chaos,


919
00:48:07.361 --> 00:48:12.834
because this was the first time
that this had ever happened.


920
00:48:12.868 --> 00:48:18.674
There had been no Panther
murdered by police.


921
00:48:18.707 --> 00:48:20.241
We
want non-violence,


922
00:48:20.274 --> 00:48:23.345
just like Martin Luther King...
but non-violence on the part


923
00:48:23.377 --> 00:48:24.747
of who?

924
00:48:24.779 --> 00:48:30.051
To sit and watch ourselves to
be slaughtered like our brother?


925
00:48:30.084 --> 00:48:33.621
We must defend ourselves,
as Malcolm X said,


926
00:48:33.654 --> 00:48:34.490
by any means necessary.

927
00:48:41.229 --> 00:48:43.464
After
the loss of Bobby Hutton,


928
00:48:43.497 --> 00:48:46.768
Eldridge was ordered to
surrender to San Francisco


929
00:48:46.801 --> 00:48:51.740
police to go back to prison,
but on November 28, 1968,


930
00:48:51.772 --> 00:48:57.212
he didn't turn himself in,
and he was not to be found.


931
00:48:57.245 --> 00:48:59.647
Mrs. Cleaver, do you
know where your husband is?


932
00:48:59.680 --> 00:49:00.782
No.

933
00:49:00.816 --> 00:49:02.017
When was the
last time you saw him?


934
00:49:02.049 --> 00:49:03.384
Sunday night.

935
00:49:03.417 --> 00:49:05.086
It's rumored that
Eldridge is out of the country.


936
00:49:05.120 --> 00:49:06.355
Do you think this is possible?

937
00:49:06.388 --> 00:49:08.424
No, I don't think so.

938
00:49:08.457 --> 00:49:10.092
And so the mystery remains...

939
00:49:10.125 --> 00:49:12.294
where is Eldridge Cleaver?

940
00:49:12.326 --> 00:49:14.562
It's entirely possible that
his wife and lawyer really


941
00:49:14.596 --> 00:49:15.698
do not know.

942
00:49:15.730 --> 00:49:18.401
To the law, he is simply
a fugitive from justice.


943
00:49:24.973 --> 00:49:26.576
He
had gone to Algeria.


944
00:49:34.116 --> 00:49:36.018
There's nothing the
United States government


945
00:49:36.051 --> 00:49:37.553
can do to us in Algeria.

946
00:49:37.586 --> 00:49:40.788
They don't have diplomatic
relations with Algeria.


947
00:49:40.821 --> 00:49:44.826
We could function openly,
politically, in Algeria,


948
00:49:44.859 --> 00:49:47.562
so we opened our international
section of the Black Panther


949
00:49:47.596 --> 00:49:47.997
Party.

950
00:49:51.667 --> 00:49:53.134
The Black Panthers

951
00:49:53.167 --> 00:49:58.406
were welcomed by all sorts
of liberation movements.


952
00:49:58.439 --> 00:50:01.776
The North Vietnamese, who were
moving into a newer embassy,


953
00:50:01.810 --> 00:50:04.446
gave their old embassy
to the Panthers.


954
00:50:04.479 --> 00:50:07.482
And the Black Panthers,
of course,


955
00:50:07.515 --> 00:50:09.050
loved being accepted like this.

956
00:50:12.654 --> 00:50:14.990
In Eldridge
Cleaver's successful attempt


957
00:50:15.022 --> 00:50:16.658
to establish an
international wing,


958
00:50:16.692 --> 00:50:19.361
he's able to do some things
that are very important.


959
00:50:19.393 --> 00:50:21.196
Malcolm X and other
black nationalists


960
00:50:21.229 --> 00:50:24.198
had talked about forging
those types of alliances.


961
00:50:24.232 --> 00:50:26.634
The Panthers actually did it.

962
00:50:29.870 --> 00:50:32.106
We wish you
victory in your struggle.


963
00:50:32.140 --> 00:50:32.941
Thank you.

964
00:50:36.278 --> 00:50:37.879
And we
hope to receive you


965
00:50:37.912 --> 00:50:39.247
in liberated Saigon.

966
00:50:39.281 --> 00:50:42.151
And tell them that I hope to
receive them in Washington, DC.


967
00:50:42.183 --> 00:50:43.819
At that time America

968
00:50:43.852 --> 00:50:47.922
was being demonized considerably
because of the war in Vietnam.


969
00:50:47.955 --> 00:50:52.593
So here we are, black Americans
who are opposed to all of this.


970
00:50:52.627 --> 00:50:55.898
We're the counter to
the United States.


971
00:50:55.930 --> 00:50:59.167
We were able to connect
with North Koreans,


972
00:50:59.200 --> 00:51:01.836
with Vietnamese,
with the Chinese,


973
00:51:01.870 --> 00:51:04.540
and with also many African
liberation movements.


974
00:51:04.573 --> 00:51:07.509
And many people came
to see us there.


975
00:51:07.542 --> 00:51:08.977
We came over here

976
00:51:09.009 --> 00:51:12.480
to do what we can to
communicate to you


977
00:51:12.513 --> 00:51:15.517
what's happening in our
struggle in the United States.


978
00:51:15.549 --> 00:51:18.086
I think a lot of what
draws these groups together


979
00:51:18.120 --> 00:51:20.388
is a kind of
anti-American sentiment.


980
00:51:20.421 --> 00:51:23.458
If you want to really shake
the American establishment,


981
00:51:23.491 --> 00:51:26.160
you want them to think
that they are in danger,


982
00:51:26.194 --> 00:51:29.365
that a revolutionary
new world is on its way.


983
00:51:29.397 --> 00:51:31.066
The Panthers are
certainly the people


984
00:51:31.098 --> 00:51:32.801
you're going to support.

985
00:51:32.834 --> 00:51:34.636
Since the United
States of America


986
00:51:34.669 --> 00:51:37.038
is the backbone of
oppression in the world,


987
00:51:37.071 --> 00:51:41.376
the blows that we strike against
the empire there will also


988
00:51:41.410 --> 00:51:44.747
aid the liberation struggles
in Africa, Asia, and Latin


989
00:51:44.779 --> 00:51:46.448
America as we aid ourselves.

990
00:51:49.785 --> 00:51:52.687
Face the Nation...
a spontaneous and unrehearsed


991
00:51:52.721 --> 00:51:55.491
news interview with the chief
of staff of the Black Panther


992
00:51:55.524 --> 00:51:57.593
Party, David Hilliard.

993
00:51:57.625 --> 00:51:59.461
Your minister of
information is now


994
00:51:59.493 --> 00:52:01.629
in exile... Eldridge Cleaver.

995
00:52:01.662 --> 00:52:03.197
You speak with him
often on the phone.


996
00:52:03.230 --> 00:52:03.866
Is that correct?

997
00:52:03.899 --> 00:52:05.067
Well, you know I do.

998
00:52:05.100 --> 00:52:06.402
They tap the phones.

999
00:52:06.435 --> 00:52:08.737
The phone is probably hooked
up through the White House.


1000
00:52:08.770 --> 00:52:11.440
The leaders of the party,
its national leadership,


1001
00:52:11.473 --> 00:52:14.610
sits with David Hilliard.

1002
00:52:14.642 --> 00:52:17.145
Bobby Seale is in
and out of prison,


1003
00:52:17.178 --> 00:52:21.149
Huey Newton is in jail... at this
point for a number of years...


1004
00:52:21.183 --> 00:52:25.287
and Eldridge Cleaver
is in Algeria.


1005
00:52:25.319 --> 00:52:29.957
David was someone
who was considered


1006
00:52:29.991 --> 00:52:35.764
a... you can say he
was a sound storekeeper.


1007
00:52:35.796 --> 00:52:38.433
He kept the shop in order.

1008
00:52:38.466 --> 00:52:39.968
Richard Nixon is
the chief spokesman


1009
00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:43.071
of the American people,
and if the man is not


1010
00:52:43.104 --> 00:52:45.441
responsible for the
people in government


1011
00:52:45.473 --> 00:52:48.109
like the FBI agencies
or the local police,


1012
00:52:48.142 --> 00:52:51.546
then he should stand up and,
let the American people know


1013
00:52:51.580 --> 00:52:54.249
that they do not endorse the
kind of campaigns that's been


1014
00:52:54.281 --> 00:52:55.417
waged against black America.

1015
00:53:01.823 --> 00:53:05.828
Nixon is elected
with a sense of a mandate


1016
00:53:05.861 --> 00:53:08.964
to crack down, and
he feels that it


1017
00:53:08.997 --> 00:53:15.437
is his personal charge after
the '68 election to repress.


1018
00:53:15.470 --> 00:53:19.908
This is a nation of laws, and
as Abraham Lincoln has said,


1019
00:53:19.941 --> 00:53:23.278
no one is above the law,
no one is below the law,


1020
00:53:23.310 --> 00:53:25.180
and we're going to
enforce the law.


1021
00:53:25.212 --> 00:53:27.048
And Americans should
remember that if we're


1022
00:53:27.082 --> 00:53:28.283
going to have law and order.

1023
00:53:28.316 --> 00:53:29.884
The
Nixon administration


1024
00:53:29.917 --> 00:53:35.057
gives J. Edgar Hoover even
more of a sense that he can


1025
00:53:35.089 --> 00:53:38.326
repress without restriction.

1026
00:53:38.359 --> 00:53:40.962
Do you feel the
nation is in trouble?


1027
00:53:40.995 --> 00:53:42.631
I think very definitely it is.

1028
00:53:42.663 --> 00:53:43.832
But what is the answer?

1029
00:53:43.865 --> 00:53:47.301
The answer is vigorous
law enforcement.


1030
00:53:47.334 --> 00:53:48.302
That's the only answer.

1031
00:53:48.336 --> 00:53:49.471
That's the only answer.

1032
00:53:49.504 --> 00:53:50.706
How about justice?

1033
00:53:50.738 --> 00:53:53.508
You hear a lot about justice
with law enforcement.


1034
00:53:53.542 --> 00:53:57.346
Justice is merely
incidental to law and order.


1035
00:54:00.348 --> 00:54:02.451
FBI director
J. Edgar Hoover today


1036
00:54:02.484 --> 00:54:04.886
asserted that the Black
Panthers represent the greatest


1037
00:54:04.919 --> 00:54:06.587
internal threat to the nation.

1038
00:54:06.620 --> 00:54:09.124
Hoover said the Panthers have
perpetrated numerous assaults


1039
00:54:09.156 --> 00:54:11.759
on police and have engaged
in violent confrontations


1040
00:54:11.792 --> 00:54:13.127
throughout the country.

1041
00:54:13.160 --> 00:54:15.396
When Hoover
identified the Black Panther


1042
00:54:15.430 --> 00:54:18.799
Party as the number one threat
to the national security


1043
00:54:18.832 --> 00:54:20.234
of the United States
at a time when


1044
00:54:20.267 --> 00:54:25.273
they're fighting in Vietnam, you
know, of course that was crazy.


1045
00:54:25.307 --> 00:54:28.910
But it was politically
very effective,


1046
00:54:28.944 --> 00:54:32.881
and it says to law enforcement
at the local level,


1047
00:54:32.913 --> 00:54:34.415
we can take the gloves off now.

1048
00:54:34.448 --> 00:54:37.685
We don't have to respect
the civil liberties


1049
00:54:37.718 --> 00:54:39.621
and we can go after them
with everything we got.


1050
00:54:50.598 --> 00:54:52.968
One of the
executive orders of the Panther


1051
00:54:53.000 --> 00:54:55.937
Party was that we was
to defend ourselves


1052
00:54:55.971 --> 00:55:00.108
from unwanted attacks,
and not allow the police


1053
00:55:00.140 --> 00:55:02.343
to just forcibly come in.

1054
00:55:02.377 --> 00:55:05.180
If the tear gas
is thrown, here's


1055
00:55:05.212 --> 00:55:06.615
your water and your eye mask.

1056
00:55:06.647 --> 00:55:08.149
Keep this on you.

1057
00:55:08.183 --> 00:55:09.251
OK.

1058
00:55:09.283 --> 00:55:11.185
Nobody's coming in the
front door... nobody.


1059
00:55:11.218 --> 00:55:12.186
No gas.

1060
00:55:12.220 --> 00:55:14.555
Nobody gets on the
roof,.


1061
00:55:14.589 --> 00:55:16.325
Well, I just wish they
would come tonight.


1062
00:55:16.357 --> 00:55:17.692
Yeah, well, I
want them to come.


1063
00:55:24.399 --> 00:55:27.502
The Panthers were a
criminal organization,


1064
00:55:27.535 --> 00:55:30.605
were violent, and they
wanted to kill cops.


1065
00:55:30.638 --> 00:55:32.607
That's all I needed to know.

1066
00:55:32.640 --> 00:55:34.675
About 40 policemen
arrived on the scene


1067
00:55:34.709 --> 00:55:37.279
and began surrounding the
Black Panther headquarters.


1068
00:55:37.312 --> 00:55:41.149
They were trying to change
government as we know it


1069
00:55:41.182 --> 00:55:44.118
to terrorist activity.

1070
00:55:44.151 --> 00:55:48.689
We took a very proactive stance
in combating what we considered


1071
00:55:48.723 --> 00:55:52.127
a terrorist organization.

1072
00:55:52.160 --> 00:55:56.431
I think the FBI
manipulated the police,


1073
00:55:56.464 --> 00:55:58.767
and the FBI arranged
for the Black Panthers


1074
00:55:58.799 --> 00:56:02.803
to get guns through informants.

1075
00:56:02.837 --> 00:56:08.276
They would convince the police
that the Panthers had weapons.


1076
00:56:08.308 --> 00:56:10.245
They had to go in and
be ready to be shot at,


1077
00:56:10.278 --> 00:56:12.615
so the police went in
and shot at them first.


1078
00:56:15.683 --> 00:56:18.653
You'd hear
about raids taking place


1079
00:56:18.687 --> 00:56:21.288
against Black Panther offices.

1080
00:56:21.321 --> 00:56:22.723
They were coming to kill us.

1081
00:56:22.756 --> 00:56:24.325
Police say there

1082
00:56:24.359 --> 00:56:26.962
was sniper fire throughout
the early morning hours,


1083
00:56:26.995 --> 00:56:29.197
so they moved in cautiously
and then began shooting.


1084
00:56:29.229 --> 00:56:31.499
The
Black Panther police shootout


1085
00:56:31.533 --> 00:56:33.634
lasted 30 minutes.

1086
00:56:33.667 --> 00:56:35.102
It was obvious
that the government


1087
00:56:35.136 --> 00:56:39.775
had made a decision that this
was all-out attack on the Black


1088
00:56:39.808 --> 00:56:40.909
Panther Party.

1089
00:56:40.942 --> 00:56:42.577
Every significant office
is going to be raided.


1090
00:56:42.609 --> 00:56:43.678
It's going to be bombed.

1091
00:56:43.712 --> 00:56:45.180
It's going to be shot.

1092
00:56:45.212 --> 00:56:47.048
They're going to
be mass arrests.


1093
00:56:47.082 --> 00:56:49.651
In the
pre-dawn hours in Chicago


1094
00:56:49.683 --> 00:56:51.653
today, police and
Negroes fought a...


1095
00:56:51.685 --> 00:56:53.854
Police
and Black Panthers clash


1096
00:56:53.888 --> 00:56:55.656
in Houston, New Orleans,
and other cities.


1097
00:56:55.689 --> 00:56:58.325
For the Black Panther Party
it was a crisis situation,


1098
00:56:58.359 --> 00:57:00.996
because we didn't have
the resources to handle


1099
00:57:01.029 --> 00:57:02.865
all these arrests
and all these trials.


1100
00:57:17.145 --> 00:57:19.248
Contributions
to Panther Defense Fund?


1101
00:57:23.084 --> 00:57:26.421
Contributions to the
Panther Defense Fund?


1102
00:57:26.453 --> 00:57:29.057
They're trying to either
wipe out the Panther Party


1103
00:57:29.089 --> 00:57:33.562
by jailing all the members and
wiping them out economically,


1104
00:57:33.595 --> 00:57:36.365
financially, or violently,
through killing them.


1105
00:57:39.299 --> 00:57:43.904
After all, they're just...
they're just Negroes, you know.


1106
00:57:43.937 --> 00:57:48.175
In other cities the Panthers
were under physical attack


1107
00:57:48.209 --> 00:57:50.511
from police departments.

1108
00:57:50.544 --> 00:57:54.448
But New York City, it was going
to handle its Panther problem


1109
00:57:54.482 --> 00:57:56.084
differently.

1110
00:57:56.116 --> 00:57:58.854
They created a
conspiracy case that


1111
00:57:58.886 --> 00:58:03.524
allowed them to arrest the
entire leadership of the New


1112
00:58:03.558 --> 00:58:06.194
York City Black Panther Party.

1113
00:58:06.227 --> 00:58:09.765
A New York grand jury has
indicted 21 alleged Black


1114
00:58:09.797 --> 00:58:13.301
Panthers on charges of plotting
several bombings in the city


1115
00:58:13.334 --> 00:58:14.469
tomorrow.

1116
00:58:14.502 --> 00:58:16.605
On April 2, 1969,

1117
00:58:16.638 --> 00:58:20.174
in, pre-dawn raids,

1118
00:58:20.207 --> 00:58:24.145
were charged with all kinds
of terrorist activity.


1119
00:58:24.178 --> 00:58:26.580
These are some of
the men the police are accusing


1120
00:58:26.613 --> 00:58:28.082
of being involved
in the plot, which


1121
00:58:28.116 --> 00:58:31.018
could have wounded or killed
scores of busy New Yorkers.


1122
00:58:31.051 --> 00:58:33.888
12 men were arrested today,
two are already in jail,


1123
00:58:33.921 --> 00:58:35.756
and seven more are
still at large.


1124
00:58:35.790 --> 00:58:38.960
And so the Panther 21 started.

1125
00:58:38.993 --> 00:58:41.196
I had just
turned 16 years old,


1126
00:58:41.229 --> 00:58:43.964
but I had already
become a section leader.


1127
00:58:43.997 --> 00:58:46.467
When they first kicked in the
door of my grandmother's house


1128
00:58:46.500 --> 00:58:48.502
at 4 o'clock in the
morning, I thought wow,


1129
00:58:48.535 --> 00:58:50.004
I'm important enough
to be arrested.


1130
00:58:50.037 --> 00:58:52.940
I'm a real Panther now.

1131
00:58:52.973 --> 00:58:56.211
There was a feeling that
it was a badge of honor.


1132
00:58:56.243 --> 00:58:57.611
This

1133
00:58:57.645 --> 00:59:00.415
was the most important
place in the nation


1134
00:59:00.448 --> 00:59:02.817
at that time for the Party.

1135
00:59:02.850 --> 00:59:05.854
It was spreading all
over the east coast...


1136
00:59:05.886 --> 00:59:10.725
from New Haven, Baltimore,
everywhere, it was spreading.


1137
00:59:10.758 --> 00:59:14.830
This group, 21 people,
was the leadership


1138
00:59:14.863 --> 00:59:20.435
of the New York area, all tied
up in court with $100,000 bails


1139
00:59:20.468 --> 00:59:23.805
which none of them could make.

1140
00:59:23.837 --> 00:59:28.375
We were facing

1141
00:59:28.408 --> 00:59:33.247
and I began to feel
and accept the fact


1142
00:59:33.281 --> 00:59:35.683
that I was going to spend the
rest of my life in prison.


1143
00:59:35.716 --> 00:59:37.051
The Black Panther Party

1144
00:59:37.084 --> 00:59:39.353
is riddled with
informers who are


1145
00:59:39.386 --> 00:59:42.524
intent on creating
situations in order


1146
00:59:42.557 --> 00:59:46.194
to bring forth such indictments
in an attempt to destroy...


1147
00:59:46.227 --> 00:59:48.964
Are you saying that
they try to frame them?


1148
00:59:48.997 --> 00:59:50.464
No question about it.

1149
00:59:50.497 --> 00:59:53.367
I mean, I told the jury
that maybe the police


1150
00:59:53.401 --> 00:59:54.136
started the Party.

1151
00:59:58.305 --> 01:00:00.074
People who've come
back to New York


1152
01:00:00.107 --> 01:00:03.377
are going to work full
time until the Panther 21


1153
01:00:03.410 --> 01:00:07.581
and the people accused are
allowed to get a fair trial.


1154
01:00:07.615 --> 01:00:10.218
We spent a lot of
time building awareness


1155
01:00:10.250 --> 01:00:11.419
and doing fundraisers.

1156
01:00:11.451 --> 01:00:14.321
And then we had to have
high profile fundraisers,


1157
01:00:14.354 --> 01:00:16.223
because this kind of
money that we needed


1158
01:00:16.256 --> 01:00:17.792
couldn't come from
the black community.


1159
01:00:24.866 --> 01:00:26.935
We would wind up
doing fundraisers


1160
01:00:26.968 --> 01:00:29.638
at places like Jane
Fonda's townhouse


1161
01:00:29.671 --> 01:00:34.241
so that we could raise money
for the Legal Defense Fund.


1162
01:00:34.274 --> 01:00:35.776
We'd all be in our
leather jackets.


1163
01:00:35.810 --> 01:00:37.545
We all would have our berets.

1164
01:00:37.578 --> 01:00:38.947
Some of us would be packing.

1165
01:00:38.979 --> 01:00:42.082
Some of us wouldn't.

1166
01:00:42.116 --> 01:00:44.486
The only people that would
speak would be the two people


1167
01:00:44.518 --> 01:00:45.886
that was designated to speak.

1168
01:00:45.919 --> 01:00:47.221
They would speak.

1169
01:00:47.254 --> 01:00:49.990
The rest of us would just
line the walls, fold our arms,


1170
01:00:50.024 --> 01:00:52.794
and look like Black Panthers...
like, you know,


1171
01:00:52.826 --> 01:00:54.662
we was ready to kill somebody.

1172
01:00:54.696 --> 01:00:57.499
And them stars, they
loved that shit.


1173
01:00:57.531 --> 01:00:59.934
They just ate that
shit up, you know.


1174
01:01:06.174 --> 01:01:09.344
After a 13-month trial

1175
01:01:09.377 --> 01:01:11.279
where New York state
spent millions of dollars


1176
01:01:11.312 --> 01:01:15.317
and put dozens of witnesses and
hundreds of pieces of evidence,


1177
01:01:15.350 --> 01:01:19.654
a jury deliberated
for three hours.


1178
01:01:19.687 --> 01:01:23.692
The jury have
considered all the counts


1179
01:01:23.725 --> 01:01:26.728
and charges against
the defendants


1180
01:01:26.761 --> 01:01:29.364
and have found them not guilty.

1181
01:01:34.801 --> 01:01:38.573
There were

1182
01:01:42.042 --> 01:01:44.445
It was astonishing.

1183
01:01:44.479 --> 01:01:46.747
Courtroom erupted.

1184
01:01:46.781 --> 01:01:48.650
The city erupted.

1185
01:01:48.683 --> 01:01:53.188
There were people dancing in
the streets as word spread.


1186
01:01:53.221 --> 01:01:54.622
Come on over.

1187
01:01:54.654 --> 01:01:59.493
Jury, defendants, everybody,
we're all here... 640 Broadway.


1188
01:01:59.526 --> 01:02:01.595
Most of the
defendants have been in jail


1189
01:02:01.629 --> 01:02:03.732
for more than two
years, unable to raise


1190
01:02:03.765 --> 01:02:05.200
the high bail set for them.

1191
01:02:05.232 --> 01:02:07.201
The trial lasted eight months.

1192
01:02:07.234 --> 01:02:08.769
The jury
reached its verdict


1193
01:02:08.803 --> 01:02:11.473
of innocent on all counts
in less than four hours,


1194
01:02:11.506 --> 01:02:14.142
concluding the longest criminal
proceeding in New York state


1195
01:02:14.174 --> 01:02:15.209
history.

1196
01:02:15.243 --> 01:02:16.811
What it was on the
part of the jury to me...


1197
01:02:16.843 --> 01:02:20.080
I don't know how each individual
juror feels... but together they


1198
01:02:20.113 --> 01:02:23.784
have rejected, once and
for all, a society which


1199
01:02:23.817 --> 01:02:25.653
refuses to allow change.

1200
01:02:25.685 --> 01:02:28.789
They said, you must allow
people to get together and think


1201
01:02:28.823 --> 01:02:31.558
about changing life
and the way they live.


1202
01:02:31.591 --> 01:02:33.961
And it's a beautiful victory.

1203
01:02:39.866 --> 01:02:42.569
Even as the New
York 21 are being acquitted,


1204
01:02:42.602 --> 01:02:46.607
you're seeing smaller trials,
other trials pop up really


1205
01:02:46.640 --> 01:02:48.542
all over the country.

1206
01:02:48.575 --> 01:02:50.911
Some of them result in
acquittals, some of them


1207
01:02:50.944 --> 01:02:53.314
result in convictions,
but this really


1208
01:02:53.346 --> 01:02:55.716
consumes most of
the Party's energy.


1209
01:02:55.750 --> 01:02:58.219
People were afraid to join.

1210
01:02:58.252 --> 01:03:00.321
They knew that it
was infiltrated.


1211
01:03:00.354 --> 01:03:03.825
They knew that they would
be watched immediately.


1212
01:03:03.857 --> 01:03:07.796
They were afraid of being
prosecuted unjustly.


1213
01:03:07.828 --> 01:03:11.198
Nobody wants to go near such
an organization that's so hot.


1214
01:03:28.216 --> 01:03:29.616
I was
part of planning


1215
01:03:29.649 --> 01:03:32.586
a demonstration against
Vietnam at the 1968


1216
01:03:32.620 --> 01:03:36.223
Democratic Convention
in Chicago.


1217
01:03:36.256 --> 01:03:39.693
Bobby Seale was
invited to speak.


1218
01:03:39.727 --> 01:03:44.866
The revolution in this
country at the time


1219
01:03:44.899 --> 01:03:50.071
is in fact people coming
forth to demand freedom.


1220
01:03:53.674 --> 01:03:55.677
He then left and didn't
have anything


1221
01:03:55.709 --> 01:03:59.847
to do with the demonstrations
or riots or confrontations


1222
01:03:59.881 --> 01:04:05.252
in Chicago, but he was arrested
on the advice of the FBI,


1223
01:04:05.285 --> 01:04:10.057
and he was later
indicted for that speech.


1224
01:04:10.091 --> 01:04:11.558
Bobby
Seale asked to have


1225
01:04:11.591 --> 01:04:14.995
his... to postpone the trial
until his lawyer, Charles Gary,


1226
01:04:15.029 --> 01:04:16.498
could come to Chicago.

1227
01:04:16.531 --> 01:04:18.766
The judge refused,
and then Bobby said well,


1228
01:04:18.799 --> 01:04:20.401
I'll represent myself.

1229
01:04:20.433 --> 01:04:22.069
It started when Seale demanded

1230
01:04:22.102 --> 01:04:24.404
to cross examine a
prosecution witness,


1231
01:04:24.437 --> 01:04:27.474
accusing the judge of denying
his constitutional rights


1232
01:04:27.508 --> 01:04:29.377
to defend himself.

1233
01:04:29.410 --> 01:04:32.080
The judge ordered him to
sit down and be quiet,


1234
01:04:32.113 --> 01:04:35.350
but the fiery Black Panther
leader continued to cry out.


1235
01:04:51.399 --> 01:04:54.736
The judge told
the marshals to hold him down,


1236
01:04:54.768 --> 01:04:57.839
and that started several
days of insanity.


1237
01:04:57.872 --> 01:04:59.674
This
stuff is a lie.


1238
01:04:59.707 --> 01:05:01.643
We have a right to.

1239
01:05:01.676 --> 01:05:04.045
I'll represent myeslf.

1240
01:05:04.078 --> 01:05:06.814
He kept insisting on
his right to represent himself,


1241
01:05:06.846 --> 01:05:08.982
and the judge's
response to that was


1242
01:05:09.015 --> 01:05:13.187
to order the bailiffs to put
gaffer tape over his mouth


1243
01:05:13.221 --> 01:05:16.791
and tie him to his chair.

1244
01:05:16.823 --> 01:05:20.427
I mean, it couldn't have been
more definitive if they had


1245
01:05:20.461 --> 01:05:23.263
put a sign on him saying slave.

1246
01:05:23.296 --> 01:05:25.666
You know.

1247
01:05:29.870 --> 01:05:32.674
But it turned out
Bobby could make noise and say


1248
01:05:32.707 --> 01:05:35.076
things through the gag.

1249
01:05:53.194 --> 01:05:54.095
Stop the trial.

1250
01:05:54.127 --> 01:05:55.363
Stop the trial.

1251
01:05:55.395 --> 01:05:56.531
Stop the trial.

1252
01:05:56.564 --> 01:05:57.498
Stop the trial.

1253
01:05:57.531 --> 01:05:58.933
Stop the trial.

1254
01:05:58.966 --> 01:05:59.901
Stop the trial.

1255
01:05:59.933 --> 01:06:00.868
Stop the trial.

1256
01:06:00.901 --> 01:06:01.836
Stop the trial.

1257
01:06:01.868 --> 01:06:03.270
Stop the trial.

1258
01:06:03.303 --> 01:06:05.906
One of the most amazing
phenomena of that time


1259
01:06:05.939 --> 01:06:10.912
was outside the federal court
building there was a plaza.


1260
01:06:10.944 --> 01:06:13.448
It was right in
the heart of town,


1261
01:06:13.480 --> 01:06:15.582
right in the middle of the loop.

1262
01:06:15.616 --> 01:06:20.321
And these kids were coming down
from the courtroom, and they...


1263
01:06:20.354 --> 01:06:22.357
with fire in
their eyes, having just


1264
01:06:22.390 --> 01:06:24.459
seen that madness up there.

1265
01:06:24.491 --> 01:06:31.466
And all of a sudden, one
day this black orator...


1266
01:06:31.499 --> 01:06:34.035
who at that time
was 20 years old...


1267
01:06:34.067 --> 01:06:36.970
starts talking to these
people, and all of a sudden


1268
01:06:37.004 --> 01:06:38.506
it's like a magnet.

1269
01:06:38.538 --> 01:06:43.745
The deputy chairman of the
Illinois Black Panther Party,


1270
01:06:43.778 --> 01:06:44.712
Fred Hampton.

1271
01:06:52.086 --> 01:06:56.457
And I just want to tell you
that the chairman of the Black


1272
01:06:56.490 --> 01:06:59.426
Panther Party is
going to be ungagged


1273
01:06:59.459 --> 01:07:04.665
and they're going to have to
take those chains off him.


1274
01:07:04.698 --> 01:07:06.200
Bobby Seale's going
through all types


1275
01:07:06.232 --> 01:07:10.238
of physical and mental
torture, but that's all right,


1276
01:07:10.270 --> 01:07:13.473
because we said even before
this happened and we're


1277
01:07:13.506 --> 01:07:16.243
going to say it after this,
and after I'm locked up


1278
01:07:16.276 --> 01:07:17.979
and after everyone's
locked up, that you


1279
01:07:18.011 --> 01:07:22.716
can jail a revolutionary,
but you can't jail a revolution.


1280
01:07:22.750 --> 01:07:25.586
Right.

1281
01:07:25.618 --> 01:07:28.256
You may run a liberator like
Eldridge out the country,


1282
01:07:28.288 --> 01:07:31.359
but you can't run a
liberation out the country.


1283
01:07:31.392 --> 01:07:34.361
You might murder a freedom
fighter like Bobby Hutton,


1284
01:07:34.395 --> 01:07:36.297
but you can't murder
freedom fighting.


1285
01:07:36.330 --> 01:07:40.268
Whatever
It was, Fred had it.


1286
01:07:40.301 --> 01:07:42.870
When he got up in front
of a group of people,


1287
01:07:42.903 --> 01:07:46.107
the words just flowed.

1288
01:07:46.140 --> 01:07:49.210
You were awash in the words, OK?

1289
01:07:49.243 --> 01:07:50.411
It was like that.

1290
01:07:50.444 --> 01:07:52.613
And I don't care how many
people were there... it's


1291
01:07:52.645 --> 01:07:54.649
like he was talking to you.

1292
01:07:54.682 --> 01:07:58.151
That's a dangerous person.

1293
01:07:58.185 --> 01:08:00.654
He wasn't above us.

1294
01:08:00.687 --> 01:08:02.323
He was one of us.

1295
01:08:02.355 --> 01:08:05.026
I'm the deputy chairman of the
State of Illinois Black Panther


1296
01:08:05.058 --> 01:08:06.326
Party, Fred Hampton.

1297
01:08:06.359 --> 01:08:08.028
By
the time he was 17,


1298
01:08:08.062 --> 01:08:12.767
he was the head of the
NAACP youth branch.


1299
01:08:12.800 --> 01:08:17.538
He was already experienced
by the time the Illinois


1300
01:08:17.571 --> 01:08:20.174
chapter of the Panther
Party was formed,


1301
01:08:20.206 --> 01:08:24.811
so he was a natural
choice to lead it.


1302
01:08:24.844 --> 01:08:28.249
We say all power to all people.

1303
01:08:28.282 --> 01:08:30.084
Fred spoke in the
People's Church


1304
01:08:30.117 --> 01:08:33.855
in August of 1969, and
I was in the crowd.


1305
01:08:33.888 --> 01:08:37.158
Toward the end of his speech,
he said, everybody stand up,


1306
01:08:37.191 --> 01:08:38.158
and we did.

1307
01:08:38.192 --> 01:08:39.794
And he says, now
raise your right hand.


1308
01:08:39.827 --> 01:08:41.662
Say this... I am
a revolutionary.


1309
01:08:41.694 --> 01:08:43.965
I am a revolutionary.

1310
01:08:43.997 --> 01:08:46.334
And I couldn't say it,
because I thought to myself,


1311
01:08:46.367 --> 01:08:47.568
I'm a lawyer for the movement.

1312
01:08:47.600 --> 01:08:48.803
I'm not a revolutionary.

1313
01:08:48.835 --> 01:08:52.439
And then he said it again...
I am a revolutionary.


1314
01:08:52.473 --> 01:08:54.207
And by the third
or fourth time, I


1315
01:08:54.241 --> 01:08:56.310
was saying a
revolutionary as loud


1316
01:08:56.343 --> 01:09:00.581
as anybody else in the room.

1317
01:09:00.613 --> 01:09:03.017
We say white power
to white people.


1318
01:09:03.050 --> 01:09:04.485
White power
to white people.


1319
01:09:04.518 --> 01:09:05.920
Brown power to brown people.

1320
01:09:05.952 --> 01:09:07.388
Brown power
to brown people.


1321
01:09:07.420 --> 01:09:08.655
Yellow power to yellow people.

1322
01:09:08.688 --> 01:09:10.157
Yellow power
to yellow people.


1323
01:09:10.191 --> 01:09:11.392
Black power to black people.

1324
01:09:11.425 --> 01:09:13.227
Black power
to black people.


1325
01:09:13.260 --> 01:09:16.297
We say Panther power
to defend our Party.


1326
01:09:16.330 --> 01:09:17.665
A lot of us thought

1327
01:09:17.697 --> 01:09:20.901
that we were on the eve of
a revolutionary situation


1328
01:09:20.934 --> 01:09:23.270
here in the United States.

1329
01:09:23.304 --> 01:09:24.939
We used to call,
the Panther Party


1330
01:09:24.971 --> 01:09:27.774
the vanguard of the movement,
because they were out


1331
01:09:27.808 --> 01:09:28.810
in the forefront.

1332
01:09:28.843 --> 01:09:32.279
They were kind of
setting the pathway.


1333
01:09:32.313 --> 01:09:35.082
The things that
that we would


1334
01:09:35.115 --> 01:09:37.518
face some repression
for, they would face it


1335
01:09:37.550 --> 01:09:39.286
10 times as great.

1336
01:09:39.319 --> 01:09:42.956
They were, sacrificing
their... oftentimes


1337
01:09:42.990 --> 01:09:44.291
their lives in the struggle.

1338
01:09:44.325 --> 01:09:46.059
And these people, this class

1339
01:09:46.093 --> 01:09:47.161
have divided themselves.

1340
01:09:47.193 --> 01:09:48.528
They say I'm black and
I hate white people.


1341
01:09:48.562 --> 01:09:50.264
I'm white and I
hate black people.


1342
01:09:50.296 --> 01:09:52.265
I'm Latin American and
I hate hillbillies.


1343
01:09:52.299 --> 01:09:54.669
I'm a hillbilly
and I hate Indians.


1344
01:09:54.702 --> 01:09:56.571
So we're fighting
amongst each other.


1345
01:09:56.603 --> 01:09:58.405
Fred
Hampton, here in Chicago,


1346
01:09:58.438 --> 01:10:00.474
was the main voice
for racial unity.


1347
01:10:00.508 --> 01:10:02.009
The
Black Panther Party


1348
01:10:02.041 --> 01:10:04.946
stood up and said that we
don't care what anybody said.


1349
01:10:04.978 --> 01:10:06.546
We don't need to
fight fire with fire.


1350
01:10:06.580 --> 01:10:08.049
Yes, we better
fight fire with water.


1351
01:10:08.081 --> 01:10:09.517
Yes, we're going to fight
racisim not with racism,


1352
01:10:09.550 --> 01:10:11.352
but we're going to
fight with solidarity.


1353
01:10:11.385 --> 01:10:14.755
We worked with organizations
such as the Young Lords...


1354
01:10:14.787 --> 01:10:18.225
a Puerto Rican street gang
that had become political...


1355
01:10:18.259 --> 01:10:21.629
and the Young
Patriots, hillbillies,


1356
01:10:21.661 --> 01:10:23.063
Appalachian white boys.

1357
01:10:36.477 --> 01:10:39.846
Bob Lee, who was our
deputy field marshal,


1358
01:10:39.880 --> 01:10:41.816
had a meeting with them,
and he was explaining


1359
01:10:41.849 --> 01:10:43.151
why we should work together.

1360
01:10:59.166 --> 01:11:00.801
The
coalition that Fred


1361
01:11:00.834 --> 01:11:03.304
was building in
Chicago represented


1362
01:11:03.336 --> 01:11:06.439
the Latinos, the poor
whites and poor blacks.


1363
01:11:06.473 --> 01:11:08.876
But also, because he
had been in the NAACP,


1364
01:11:08.908 --> 01:11:11.645
he had linkages with folks who
in the congregations, or church


1365
01:11:11.679 --> 01:11:14.115
folks, and with
working class folks.


1366
01:11:14.148 --> 01:11:16.817
So Fred was building a
broad-based coalition


1367
01:11:16.849 --> 01:11:18.519
in Chicago, and
that was the threat.


1368
01:11:27.227 --> 01:11:30.464
J. Edgar Hoover most
feared young whites uniting


1369
01:11:30.496 --> 01:11:32.365
with the blacks' struggle.

1370
01:11:32.398 --> 01:11:35.102
And he was most
afraid of, what


1371
01:11:35.135 --> 01:11:40.341
he called a black messiah,
rising up out of this movement.


1372
01:11:43.611 --> 01:11:46.080
Fred Hampton
was very good at running


1373
01:11:46.112 --> 01:11:47.013
an organization.

1374
01:11:47.046 --> 01:11:48.982
He could delegate
responsibility.


1375
01:11:49.015 --> 01:11:50.550
He could spot talent.

1376
01:11:50.584 --> 01:11:52.486
The one thing that
he failed to spot,


1377
01:11:52.519 --> 01:11:57.391
however, was the FBI
plant... who was, of course,


1378
01:11:57.424 --> 01:11:58.259
his personal bodyguard.

1379
01:12:04.531 --> 01:12:06.000
I routinely supplied

1380
01:12:06.032 --> 01:12:11.471
whatever floor plans or diagrams
I could, to the FBI.


1381
01:12:11.505 --> 01:12:14.108
I... that started in June, 1969.

1382
01:12:14.140 --> 01:12:17.178
I mean, they had a floor plan
and keys to the Black Panther


1383
01:12:17.210 --> 01:12:17.644
headquarters.

1384
01:12:22.549 --> 01:12:26.653
December 3, 1969, there was
a rally at the People's Church


1385
01:12:26.687 --> 01:12:28.255
on the west side of Chicago.

1386
01:12:28.287 --> 01:12:30.124
And it was one of those
rallies where Fred


1387
01:12:30.157 --> 01:12:32.393
gave one of those speeches.

1388
01:12:32.425 --> 01:12:33.760
I don't believe I'm

1389
01:12:33.794 --> 01:12:35.229
going to die in a car wreck.

1390
01:12:35.261 --> 01:12:37.163
I don't believe I'm going
to die from slipping


1391
01:12:37.197 --> 01:12:38.132
on a piece of ice.

1392
01:12:38.165 --> 01:12:39.500
I don't believe that
I'm going to die


1393
01:12:39.532 --> 01:12:41.835
because I've got a bad heart.

1394
01:12:41.868 --> 01:12:43.638
Why don't you heal
for the people?


1395
01:12:43.670 --> 01:12:45.205
Why don't you struggle
for the people?


1396
01:12:45.238 --> 01:12:46.607
Why don't you die
for the people?


1397
01:12:50.109 --> 01:12:53.046
Close to 12 midnight,
William O'Neal


1398
01:12:53.080 --> 01:12:56.117
came and picked me up
and brought me back


1399
01:12:56.149 --> 01:12:58.952
to our apartment.

1400
01:12:58.986 --> 01:13:03.090
Chairman Fred had been running

1401
01:13:03.122 --> 01:13:04.325
so he fell asleep.

1402
01:13:07.327 --> 01:13:12.433
I was 8 and 1/2 months
pregnant with our son,


1403
01:13:12.465 --> 01:13:14.434
so I fell asleep too.

1404
01:13:17.438 --> 01:13:19.674
Police attached
to the Cook County State's


1405
01:13:19.706 --> 01:13:22.509
Attorney's office raided
a Chicago apartment


1406
01:13:22.542 --> 01:13:25.078
shared by two high ranking
members of the Black Panther


1407
01:13:25.112 --> 01:13:27.348
Party before dawn today.

1408
01:13:27.380 --> 01:13:29.950
The police were acting on a
tip that a supply of weapons


1409
01:13:29.983 --> 01:13:33.187
was in the apartment.

1410
01:13:33.219 --> 01:13:36.022
The state's
attorney recreated


1411
01:13:36.055 --> 01:13:39.259
the layout of the
Panther apartment


1412
01:13:39.292 --> 01:13:41.629
and, made
arrangements for them


1413
01:13:41.661 --> 01:13:44.731
to produce his version
of what happened.


1414
01:13:44.764 --> 01:13:45.765
He stands up.

1415
01:13:45.799 --> 01:13:48.602
I stepped over and
I put the machine...


1416
01:13:48.635 --> 01:13:49.937
In short bursts.

1417
01:13:49.969 --> 01:13:52.740
We realized that there are
still some people remaining...


1418
01:13:52.773 --> 01:13:54.709
And before I could
get past the threshold,


1419
01:13:54.742 --> 01:13:58.045
there were three shots
fired from the rear bedroom.


1420
01:13:58.077 --> 01:14:00.947
The immediate, violent,
criminal reaction


1421
01:14:00.980 --> 01:14:04.719
of the occupants in shooting
at announced police officers


1422
01:14:04.751 --> 01:14:06.986
emphasizes the
extreme viciousness


1423
01:14:07.019 --> 01:14:09.223
of the Black Panther Party.

1424
01:14:09.255 --> 01:14:12.692
So does their refusal to cease
firing at the police officers


1425
01:14:12.725 --> 01:14:15.462
when urged to do
so several times.


1426
01:14:15.496 --> 01:14:17.998
When the 15-minute
gun battle was over,


1427
01:14:18.031 --> 01:14:19.867
two Black Panthers were dead.

1428
01:14:19.899 --> 01:14:22.836
Police and Panthers differ
about what happened.


1429
01:14:27.140 --> 01:14:30.344
In the apartment, we
received no warning,


1430
01:14:30.376 --> 01:14:37.785
no tear gas... nothing to offer
us to surrender or come out.


1431
01:14:37.818 --> 01:14:42.422
Bullets start coming through
the walls... plaster flying.


1432
01:14:42.456 --> 01:14:44.091
Saw bullets coming,
I mean, looked


1433
01:14:44.124 --> 01:14:48.595
like the front of the apartment,
from the kitchen area.


1434
01:14:48.629 --> 01:14:52.767
They were... the police
were just shooting.


1435
01:14:52.800 --> 01:14:56.303
This cop stepped to the
door with a sub-machine gun


1436
01:14:56.335 --> 01:14:59.706
and you could see
was a silhouette.


1437
01:14:59.740 --> 01:15:05.513
And the muzzle flash
as he fired, you know,


1438
01:15:05.545 --> 01:15:09.316
a fully automatic
weapon into, a room


1439
01:15:09.349 --> 01:15:10.918
that was barely six feet wide.

1440
01:15:14.121 --> 01:15:16.090
I laid
on top of Chairman Fred,


1441
01:15:16.122 --> 01:15:20.294
and I could feel even through
him the mattress vibrating.


1442
01:15:20.327 --> 01:15:22.897
You could feel the
bullets gong into you.


1443
01:15:22.929 --> 01:15:26.933
I just knew we'd be
dead, everybody in there.


1444
01:15:26.966 --> 01:15:31.604
Cop stepped back in and,
fired off another round, hit me


1445
01:15:31.638 --> 01:15:33.040
in the hips.

1446
01:15:33.072 --> 01:15:37.076
Everything was like this,
it was just going so fast.


1447
01:15:37.109 --> 01:15:38.912
We told them we were
wounded, and they said


1448
01:15:38.946 --> 01:15:40.413
come out with your hands up.

1449
01:15:40.447 --> 01:15:44.251
One of them grabbed my robe
and they swung it open and say


1450
01:15:44.283 --> 01:15:44.919
what do you?

1451
01:15:44.952 --> 01:15:46.854
We got a broad here.

1452
01:15:46.886 --> 01:15:48.589
And then another
one grabbed my hair


1453
01:15:48.621 --> 01:15:52.425
and slung me into
the kitchen area.


1454
01:15:52.459 --> 01:15:56.197
I heard a voice say,
he's barely alive.


1455
01:15:56.229 --> 01:15:58.031
He's... he'll barely make it.

1456
01:15:58.064 --> 01:16:00.567
They started shooting again.

1457
01:16:00.600 --> 01:16:04.404
I heard a sister scream
and they stopped shooting.


1458
01:16:04.438 --> 01:16:07.175
Police said he's
good and dead now.


1459
01:16:20.953 --> 01:16:25.192
The police made what must
be a historic type of blunder


1460
01:16:25.224 --> 01:16:27.327
in leaving the apartment open.

1461
01:16:27.361 --> 01:16:31.665
So right away people
went in there.


1462
01:16:31.697 --> 01:16:38.905
I stepped into the
living room and there


1463
01:16:38.938 --> 01:16:42.575
was blood, Fred's blood,
pouring from... all the way


1464
01:16:42.608 --> 01:16:45.178
from the bedroom in
the very back of house,


1465
01:16:45.211 --> 01:16:49.950
out into... from the kitchen
into the living room.


1466
01:16:52.118 --> 01:16:53.687
It was
like a slaughterhouse


1467
01:16:53.719 --> 01:16:57.023
and there was blood
all over the place.


1468
01:16:57.057 --> 01:17:01.895
When we lifted the mattress
up to look underneath,


1469
01:17:01.929 --> 01:17:05.600
three 45-caliber machine gun
slugs fell out of the mattress.


1470
01:17:09.068 --> 01:17:12.171
Only one shot came
from a Panther weapon,


1471
01:17:12.205 --> 01:17:14.575
because Mark Clark,
a young kid who


1472
01:17:14.608 --> 01:17:17.578
answered the door
was shot in the heart


1473
01:17:17.611 --> 01:17:20.480
as he answered the
door and the gun


1474
01:17:20.514 --> 01:17:24.551
dropped and went off
through the ceiling.


1475
01:17:24.584 --> 01:17:27.988
All of the splinters were
coming into the apartment.


1476
01:17:28.020 --> 01:17:30.424
So we said, this was a shoot-in.

1477
01:17:30.456 --> 01:17:31.758
It wasn't a shootout.

1478
01:17:31.791 --> 01:17:33.359
There's gas that
the police department


1479
01:17:33.393 --> 01:17:35.529
uses as standard equipment
that nobody can stand


1480
01:17:35.562 --> 01:17:36.964
to stay in the room with it.

1481
01:17:36.996 --> 01:17:38.798
They could have shot
four canisters of gas


1482
01:17:38.831 --> 01:17:41.134
and then waited outside
for everybody to come out.


1483
01:17:41.167 --> 01:17:43.403
Then this was,
this was planned?


1484
01:17:43.437 --> 01:17:46.874
This was a plan to
get Fred Hampton?


1485
01:17:46.907 --> 01:17:49.243
All indications
to me personally


1486
01:17:49.276 --> 01:17:52.813
that this was, obviously
a political assassination.


1487
01:17:52.845 --> 01:17:56.517
I don't think anybody would
have expected the police


1488
01:17:56.550 --> 01:17:59.687
to commit just murder.

1489
01:17:59.719 --> 01:18:01.655
It takes a certain kind
of guy to carry that out.


1490
01:18:05.625 --> 01:18:08.295
They lied about what
happened that night.


1491
01:18:08.327 --> 01:18:10.263
Much of what they
said happened couldn't


1492
01:18:10.296 --> 01:18:12.866
have happened the way
they say that it happened.


1493
01:18:12.898 --> 01:18:14.734
Today many blacks
came to the house


1494
01:18:14.768 --> 01:18:17.404
where Fred Hampton was
killed to see for themselves.


1495
01:18:17.437 --> 01:18:18.872
Don't touch nothing.

1496
01:18:18.904 --> 01:18:21.908
Don't move nothing because
we want to keep everything


1497
01:18:21.942 --> 01:18:23.644
just the way it is.

1498
01:18:23.676 --> 01:18:25.712
They fired through the
door and hit the brother


1499
01:18:25.746 --> 01:18:26.779
through the door.

1500
01:18:26.813 --> 01:18:29.350
The brother was shot
four or five times,


1501
01:18:29.383 --> 01:18:31.385
though after they
came through the door,


1502
01:18:31.417 --> 01:18:33.687
they shot him again to
make sure he was dead.


1503
01:18:33.719 --> 01:18:37.090
This is where our chairman had
his brains blown out as he,


1504
01:18:37.124 --> 01:18:41.362
laying in bed sleeping
at 4:30 in the morning.


1505
01:18:41.394 --> 01:18:44.665
I do not intend to
quibble about that account.


1506
01:18:44.697 --> 01:18:46.433
Do you know
that it's the truth?


1507
01:18:50.269 --> 01:18:54.841
The account that we gave
of the events is the truth.


1508
01:18:54.875 --> 01:18:57.978
It was a death squad
that did this raid.


1509
01:18:58.010 --> 01:19:01.781
It was a police death
squad, and the whole thing


1510
01:19:01.814 --> 01:19:05.486
was set up by the FBI.

1511
01:19:05.519 --> 01:19:09.490
The FBI gave William
O'Neal a $300 bonus


1512
01:19:09.523 --> 01:19:13.493
because of his information being
so valuable and not available


1513
01:19:13.527 --> 01:19:15.529
for any other source.

1514
01:19:15.562 --> 01:19:19.599
Internally, the FBI was bragging
and taking credit for the raid.


1515
01:19:19.633 --> 01:19:22.202
Publicly they were denying any
knowledge or participation.


1516
01:19:39.719 --> 01:19:41.855
The funeral of
the slain Panther leader


1517
01:19:41.888 --> 01:19:44.491
was marked by angry
eulogies, including


1518
01:19:44.523 --> 01:19:47.560
one from Ralph Abernathy, head
of the non-violent Southern


1519
01:19:47.594 --> 01:19:49.630
Christian Leadership Conference.

1520
01:19:49.662 --> 01:19:52.598
Enjoy your peace,
Freddie, because there


1521
01:19:52.631 --> 01:20:00.040
will be no peace in this land
until freedom comes to all.


1522
01:20:00.072 --> 01:20:07.713
We are going to trample
these streets with our feet.


1523
01:20:15.421 --> 01:20:20.460
The last message that I
think that Fred would've,


1524
01:20:20.493 --> 01:20:24.197
wanted everybody to
hear... and that is I am...


1525
01:20:24.230 --> 01:20:25.599
I am.

1526
01:20:25.631 --> 01:20:26.799
A revolutionary.

1527
01:20:26.832 --> 01:20:28.734
A revolutionary.

1528
01:20:28.768 --> 01:20:29.435
I am.

1529
01:20:29.469 --> 01:20:34.608
I am a revolutionary.

1530
01:20:34.640 --> 01:20:40.947
I am a revolutionary.

1531
01:20:40.980 --> 01:20:44.785
I am...

1532
01:20:48.554 --> 01:20:51.124
We didn't know
when it was going to happen,


1533
01:20:51.157 --> 01:20:55.394
but we felt there was
something about to happen.


1534
01:20:55.428 --> 01:21:00.434
We were filling up sandbags,
fortifying the headquarters,


1535
01:21:00.466 --> 01:21:04.036
putting sand in the
walls, putting sandbags


1536
01:21:04.069 --> 01:21:08.040
around the entrance
to the office.


1537
01:21:08.073 --> 01:21:11.245
Well, we were actually trying
to build a tunnel to the sewer


1538
01:21:11.277 --> 01:21:13.546
line.

1539
01:21:13.580 --> 01:21:16.649
If the police
attacked us, we were


1540
01:21:16.683 --> 01:21:18.719
going to escape into the
sewers, and you know,


1541
01:21:18.751 --> 01:21:20.920
we were going to set
charges on the building


1542
01:21:20.953 --> 01:21:24.424
and blow the building
after we left.


1543
01:21:24.456 --> 01:21:26.626
It seemed like it was
more... it was more,


1544
01:21:26.660 --> 01:21:28.795
police presence around.

1545
01:21:28.827 --> 01:21:30.464
We were getting stopped more.

1546
01:21:30.496 --> 01:21:33.066
We were getting harassed more.

1547
01:21:33.099 --> 01:21:34.535
I think they found out

1548
01:21:34.568 --> 01:21:37.571
that it was a different
climate for them here.


1549
01:21:37.603 --> 01:21:41.207
We'd stop them, we'd search
them, we'd shake them down.


1550
01:21:41.241 --> 01:21:43.076
And I think we did
establish that we


1551
01:21:43.108 --> 01:21:44.444
were the dominating force.

1552
01:21:47.746 --> 01:21:50.183
The Special Weapons
and Tactics concept


1553
01:21:50.216 --> 01:21:52.752
was formed in 1966.

1554
01:21:52.786 --> 01:21:56.156
The original SWAT team in the
United States... or anywhere,


1555
01:21:56.188 --> 01:21:58.724
for that matter... was
the LAPD SWAT team.


1556
01:21:58.758 --> 01:22:03.596
And in, this particular
case, this was the first time,


1557
01:22:03.630 --> 01:22:08.969
the SWAT team was activated
to serve a high risk warrant.


1558
01:22:16.076 --> 01:22:19.346
It was decided that a no-knock
warrant would be utilized,


1559
01:22:19.379 --> 01:22:23.416
and surprise would be the
element that you would use.


1560
01:22:23.450 --> 01:22:27.854
A very close friend was working
intelligence, and he told me,


1561
01:22:27.886 --> 01:22:29.956
he said, Pat, these guys
think they're going up


1562
01:22:29.990 --> 01:22:31.657
against some street hoodlums.

1563
01:22:31.691 --> 01:22:32.693
He said, they're not.

1564
01:22:32.725 --> 01:22:34.493
They're fighters and
they're shooters.


1565
01:22:34.527 --> 01:22:37.764
Don't be at the door.

1566
01:22:37.796 --> 01:22:42.068
I am on watch on the roof,
and it's a real quiet night.


1567
01:22:42.102 --> 01:22:43.470
Everything is just still.

1568
01:22:43.502 --> 01:22:46.273
You don't hear anything.

1569
01:22:46.305 --> 01:22:48.774
The access to that roof
on the other side... pow!


1570
01:22:48.808 --> 01:22:49.776
It breaks open.

1571
01:22:49.809 --> 01:22:51.144
By the time I was
swinging around


1572
01:22:51.176 --> 01:22:52.478
I'm seeing the lights on me.

1573
01:22:52.511 --> 01:22:54.480
They had a big light,
and I'm hearing


1574
01:22:54.514 --> 01:22:56.283
the whole... freeze, freeze!

1575
01:22:56.316 --> 01:22:57.483
Still, drop it!

1576
01:22:57.517 --> 01:23:02.221
And the front door
blew open... went boom!


1577
01:23:02.255 --> 01:23:04.758
Well, Pat had went
in the gun room.


1578
01:23:04.791 --> 01:23:06.893
We had a Thompson
sub-machine gun,


1579
01:23:06.925 --> 01:23:09.763
put it down with that
Thompson... wa wa wa wa wa wa wa.


1580
01:23:09.795 --> 01:23:15.101
And he sprays across
the... across


1581
01:23:15.135 --> 01:23:16.236
the roof.

1582
01:23:16.269 --> 01:23:17.337
You could see it in the
light from the street.


1583
01:23:17.370 --> 01:23:19.006
And I was seeing, it
was like... at the time,


1584
01:23:19.038 --> 01:23:20.741
man, I'm going to
tell you, that instance,


1585
01:23:20.773 --> 01:23:22.808
it was the best
music I ever heard.


1586
01:23:22.841 --> 01:23:25.211
And then all of a sudden
my gun just went off.


1587
01:23:25.245 --> 01:23:26.446
I don't know what happened.

1588
01:23:26.478 --> 01:23:28.381
The gun just went off,
you know, so we had them


1589
01:23:28.415 --> 01:23:30.149
in flank in front.

1590
01:23:30.183 --> 01:23:32.352
And then Paul Redd got down.

1591
01:23:32.385 --> 01:23:36.256
He got busy, and we drove
them out the front door.


1592
01:23:36.288 --> 01:23:42.828
Three officers were
down and the gun fight


1593
01:23:42.862 --> 01:23:45.232
continued as the officers
were drug out of the way


1594
01:23:45.264 --> 01:23:48.602
by other officers.

1595
01:23:48.635 --> 01:23:52.539
Peaches and Tommy were two
sisters that were there.


1596
01:23:52.572 --> 01:23:54.541
They went into
the communication,


1597
01:23:54.573 --> 01:23:57.243
which is, you know, start
calling the news media


1598
01:23:57.277 --> 01:23:59.212
and calling national
headquarters


1599
01:23:59.245 --> 01:24:02.816
and calling everybody
they could call.


1600
01:24:02.849 --> 01:24:04.785
Five minutes after 10,

1601
01:24:04.818 --> 01:24:09.156
about four and 1/2 hours after
the original raid this morning.


1602
01:24:09.188 --> 01:24:10.289
All right.

1603
01:24:10.322 --> 01:24:13.359
Running down the street
now toward the building.


1604
01:24:13.393 --> 01:24:15.362
Going to see what's going on.

1605
01:24:15.394 --> 01:24:21.100
There are police officers, look
like Vietnam combat uniforms,


1606
01:24:21.134 --> 01:24:25.471
with automatic weapons,
calling us back.


1607
01:24:25.505 --> 01:24:27.507
Shotguns everywhere
you can look.


1608
01:24:27.540 --> 01:24:29.076
I looked at the TV.

1609
01:24:29.108 --> 01:24:33.145
Channel 5 had it on live.

1610
01:24:33.179 --> 01:24:35.849
So I'm feeling like I
can sneak in the back


1611
01:24:35.881 --> 01:24:40.120
and join them some kind of way...
it's crazy as I'm thinking.


1612
01:24:40.152 --> 01:24:43.089
There's a large
group of people right now.


1613
01:24:43.122 --> 01:24:44.857
They're putting the
pressure on the police


1614
01:24:44.890 --> 01:24:47.161
to allow us to stay so
we can witness this.


1615
01:24:50.162 --> 01:24:51.598
When the police was

1616
01:24:51.630 --> 01:24:53.299
trying to creep up
on the side, you


1617
01:24:53.332 --> 01:24:56.370
could see them, their reflection,
through the windows


1618
01:24:56.402 --> 01:24:57.136
across the street.

1619
01:24:59.773 --> 01:25:02.509
When they got close
enough, they would tell me,


1620
01:25:02.541 --> 01:25:03.910
OK, throw it now, throw it now.

1621
01:25:03.943 --> 01:25:06.480
Then they'd throw the damn bomb
out the window and the police,


1622
01:25:06.513 --> 01:25:08.247
they'd blow up and
they'd run back and shit.


1623
01:25:11.518 --> 01:25:16.089
We see this little cloud of
smoke come, and it just moved.


1624
01:25:16.121 --> 01:25:17.023
And that's the tear gas.

1625
01:25:20.193 --> 01:25:23.163
Back in those days everybody
smoked all the time.


1626
01:25:23.196 --> 01:25:27.768
So what we did was we put the
cigarette butts in our nose


1627
01:25:27.800 --> 01:25:31.237
to filter out the fumes.

1628
01:25:31.270 --> 01:25:34.206
We're looking right
at the Panther headquarters.


1629
01:25:34.240 --> 01:25:35.876
The devastation is astounding.

1630
01:25:35.908 --> 01:25:38.511
The whole front of the building
has been shot up... bullet holes


1631
01:25:38.545 --> 01:25:40.647
all over the place,
front door smashed down,


1632
01:25:40.679 --> 01:25:42.615
screens ripped out.

1633
01:25:42.648 --> 01:25:45.050
I got shot here,
got shot in the arm,


1634
01:25:45.084 --> 01:25:46.886
missed... they missed
my head here.


1635
01:25:46.920 --> 01:25:48.587
I got buckshot all in me.

1636
01:25:48.621 --> 01:25:50.223
They shot that
room up, you know.


1637
01:25:50.255 --> 01:25:51.524
So this arm was dead.

1638
01:25:51.558 --> 01:25:53.960
So now I'm up there
with just one arm,


1639
01:25:53.992 --> 01:25:55.562
bleeding all down
the face and stuff.


1640
01:25:58.430 --> 01:25:59.665
But I'm alive.

1641
01:25:59.698 --> 01:26:02.602
I felt free.

1642
01:26:02.635 --> 01:26:05.639
I felt absolutely free.

1643
01:26:05.671 --> 01:26:09.108
And I was a
free Negro, you know.


1644
01:26:09.142 --> 01:26:12.278
I was making my own rules.

1645
01:26:12.312 --> 01:26:13.212
You couldn't get in.

1646
01:26:13.246 --> 01:26:14.281
I couldn't get out.

1647
01:26:14.313 --> 01:26:18.484
But in my space, 
I was the king.

1648
01:26:18.518 --> 01:26:24.323
In that little space
I had, I was the king.


1649
01:26:24.357 --> 01:26:30.897
And that's what I
felt. You understand?


1650
01:26:30.929 --> 01:26:32.064
That's what I felt.

1651
01:26:37.437 --> 01:26:41.374
We had riflemen across
the street... on the roofs


1652
01:26:41.407 --> 01:26:42.709
across the street.

1653
01:26:42.742 --> 01:26:45.045
They were shooting
into the... well,


1654
01:26:45.077 --> 01:26:47.714
the shooting ports
of the building


1655
01:26:47.746 --> 01:26:49.148
that the Panthers had created.

1656
01:26:49.182 --> 01:26:52.251
Panthers, on the other hand,
were shooting back out.


1657
01:26:55.587 --> 01:27:00.759
Tommy had come downstairs
and she was laying behind me,


1658
01:27:00.792 --> 01:27:02.127
like in a T.

1659
01:27:02.161 --> 01:27:06.566
You could see, a sunbeam
went across her legs like that.


1660
01:27:06.599 --> 01:27:08.435
So like, you need to move.

1661
01:27:08.468 --> 01:27:11.136
And she... you know, she didn't,
she just kept talking and shit.


1662
01:27:11.170 --> 01:27:13.373
Next thing, you
hear a shot go off.


1663
01:27:13.406 --> 01:27:15.742
The bullet went through
both her legs, like that.


1664
01:27:15.774 --> 01:27:20.580
So you know, at this time we
had pretty much got shot out.


1665
01:27:20.612 --> 01:27:22.249
You know, we were
saving enough bullets


1666
01:27:22.282 --> 01:27:23.984
that when they came
in the door that we


1667
01:27:24.017 --> 01:27:27.086
would have some bullets to
shoot back with, you know.


1668
01:27:27.120 --> 01:27:28.622
And I mean, it
was like... it wasn't


1669
01:27:28.654 --> 01:27:31.224
like it took no brain
scientist to figure out,


1670
01:27:31.256 --> 01:27:32.959
well, this shit is over with.

1671
01:27:32.992 --> 01:27:37.364
We were talking about
giving up, and, you know,


1672
01:27:37.397 --> 01:27:39.198
all the brothers saying
well, man, I'm ain't


1673
01:27:39.232 --> 01:27:40.433
going out there, man.

1674
01:27:40.465 --> 01:27:41.535
I'm not giving up.

1675
01:27:41.568 --> 01:27:43.637
And for like 30 minutes,
it just want around.


1676
01:27:43.670 --> 01:27:45.038
I'm not going out first.

1677
01:27:45.071 --> 01:27:46.540
And I'm not going out first.

1678
01:27:46.572 --> 01:27:47.840
We'll die in this motherfucker.

1679
01:27:47.874 --> 01:27:49.709
I'm not going out first.

1680
01:27:49.742 --> 01:27:51.111
Peaches said I'll go out there.

1681
01:27:51.144 --> 01:27:52.445
And I said, Peaches.

1682
01:27:52.478 --> 01:27:54.214
She said, no, I'll go.

1683
01:27:54.246 --> 01:27:56.348
There's a white
flag coming out the door.


1684
01:27:56.381 --> 01:27:57.216
It's a woman.

1685
01:27:57.250 --> 01:27:59.019
She's holding her hands up.

1686
01:28:01.853 --> 01:28:06.025
And she went
outside and Peaches gave up.


1687
01:28:06.059 --> 01:28:08.395
And when they didn't
shoot Peaches there,


1688
01:28:08.428 --> 01:28:10.564
we came out one at a time.

1689
01:28:10.596 --> 01:28:12.032
That's how that went.

1690
01:28:17.903 --> 01:28:22.308
It was a big glorious shootout,
but after they raided us


1691
01:28:22.341 --> 01:28:25.711
they had all the
players locked up.


1692
01:28:25.745 --> 01:28:27.147
All of the main players
was in jail.


1693
01:28:33.118 --> 01:28:36.022
We
want Huey out today.


1694
01:28:36.054 --> 01:28:38.959
We want Huey out today.

1695
01:28:38.992 --> 01:28:40.427
For
about three years,


1696
01:28:40.460 --> 01:28:42.862
the Black Panthers have
used Huey Newton's name


1697
01:28:42.894 --> 01:28:45.297
for a rallying cry,
demanding that he


1698
01:28:45.331 --> 01:28:48.668
be freed from jail, where he
is held on a charge of killing


1699
01:28:48.701 --> 01:28:49.868
a police officer.

1700
01:28:49.902 --> 01:28:52.973
The words "free Huey
Newton" have been chalked


1701
01:28:53.005 --> 01:28:56.308
and spray painted on a
thousand fences and walls.


1702
01:28:56.341 --> 01:28:58.577
This spring, the
California Supreme Court


1703
01:28:58.611 --> 01:29:01.781
found some errors in his
trial and ordered a new trial.


1704
01:29:08.453 --> 01:29:10.857
When the case was
given to the jury,


1705
01:29:10.889 --> 01:29:13.826
they were sequestered for
four days to deliberate.


1706
01:29:24.269 --> 01:29:26.505
It was extremely tense.

1707
01:29:26.538 --> 01:29:30.910
You could feel the energy
and the tension in the air.


1708
01:29:30.943 --> 01:29:33.513
People were talking about doing
all types of things, you know.


1709
01:29:33.545 --> 01:29:36.249
And Oakland could
explode, you know.


1710
01:29:36.282 --> 01:29:39.319
Matter of fact, every
city across America


1711
01:29:39.352 --> 01:29:42.488
could explode that day.

1712
01:29:42.522 --> 01:29:46.059
The Panthers had been getting
ready for guerrilla warfare,


1713
01:29:46.091 --> 01:29:48.260
and they said
the sky's the limit


1714
01:29:48.294 --> 01:29:50.095
if the jury convicted him.

1715
01:29:50.129 --> 01:29:51.531
We want Huey!

1716
01:29:51.563 --> 01:29:52.999
We want Huey!

1717
01:29:53.032 --> 01:29:54.467
We want Huey!

1718
01:29:54.500 --> 01:29:55.902
We want Huey!

1719
01:29:55.934 --> 01:29:57.836
We want Huey!

1720
01:29:57.870 --> 01:30:00.073
Shouting
we want Huey now,


1721
01:30:00.105 --> 01:30:01.974
the crowd got their wish.

1722
01:30:02.008 --> 01:30:04.477
At this hour Huey
Newton is a free man.


1723
01:30:12.151 --> 01:30:16.055
Everybody
was just jubilant that day.


1724
01:30:16.089 --> 01:30:21.327
Finally he gets to walk out
of that jail a free man.


1725
01:30:21.359 --> 01:30:24.930
The sky was the limit
and the sky turned blue.


1726
01:30:35.407 --> 01:30:38.444
The image that was mobilized
to create the Free Huey movement


1727
01:30:38.478 --> 01:30:41.214
gave Huey almost mythic
status in the Party.


1728
01:30:41.246 --> 01:30:43.615
He had become an
image and not a man,


1729
01:30:43.648 --> 01:30:47.886
and that gave him power that
ultimately proved dangerous.


1730
01:30:47.920 --> 01:30:49.389
Come to the clinic

1731
01:30:49.421 --> 01:30:50.790
tomorrow for an appointment.

1732
01:30:56.328 --> 01:30:57.764
He
came out focusing


1733
01:30:57.796 --> 01:31:00.866
on returning to the survival
program, the breakfast


1734
01:31:00.899 --> 01:31:04.103
program, the free health
clinics, free food


1735
01:31:04.136 --> 01:31:07.040
program, and the sickle cell
anemia research program.


1736
01:31:10.175 --> 01:31:13.580
I remember Huey P. Newton
saying the Black Panther Party


1737
01:31:13.612 --> 01:31:15.547
was not going to last.

1738
01:31:15.581 --> 01:31:17.717
He said the organization
was going to get destroyed,


1739
01:31:17.750 --> 01:31:19.152
based on the way we were.

1740
01:31:19.184 --> 01:31:21.420
We were very aggressive,
and we kind of


1741
01:31:21.453 --> 01:31:23.389
realized that this wasn't
going to last long.


1742
01:31:26.492 --> 01:31:29.662
We know those are
not revolutionary programs.


1743
01:31:29.694 --> 01:31:32.131
They are, at best,
survival programs.


1744
01:31:32.165 --> 01:31:36.202
We know that the people are
in jeopardy of genocide,


1745
01:31:36.234 --> 01:31:39.005
and that if they
do not survive then


1746
01:31:39.037 --> 01:31:41.508
it won't be possible to
bring about revolution.


1747
01:31:41.541 --> 01:31:45.478
We were really
trying to connect more


1748
01:31:45.510 --> 01:31:48.313
with the people
in the community.


1749
01:31:48.346 --> 01:31:51.017
And this was,
this was a big push.


1750
01:31:51.050 --> 01:31:57.590
And there was probably some
people who were not happy.


1751
01:31:57.622 --> 01:32:00.359
We have a breakfast for
children program here.


1752
01:32:00.393 --> 01:32:02.962
But that's not what the Black
Panther Party is all about,


1753
01:32:02.995 --> 01:32:04.330
you see.

1754
01:32:04.362 --> 01:32:07.800
I don't agree with saying that
the Black Panther Party,


1755
01:32:07.834 --> 01:32:09.536
supports breakfast for
children and that's


1756
01:32:09.568 --> 01:32:10.836
all that we're about, you know.

1757
01:32:10.870 --> 01:32:12.538
Don't talk about
this other thing.


1758
01:32:12.572 --> 01:32:15.074
The Black Panther Party is for
overthrowing the United States


1759
01:32:15.107 --> 01:32:16.309
government.

1760
01:32:16.341 --> 01:32:18.812
Those people who were on
the other side of this issue


1761
01:32:18.844 --> 01:32:21.647
politically did not see
the Black Panther Party


1762
01:32:21.680 --> 01:32:23.782
as a vehicle for social service.

1763
01:32:23.816 --> 01:32:26.786
We saw it as a vehicle for
political transformation,


1764
01:32:26.818 --> 01:32:29.221
radical change...
for revolution.


1765
01:32:29.255 --> 01:32:31.424
So we couldn't get
excited about survival.


1766
01:32:37.229 --> 01:32:38.831
Eldridge Cleaver, who...

1767
01:32:38.865 --> 01:32:40.733
while sitting comfortably
in Algeria...


1768
01:32:40.765 --> 01:32:42.902
was assailing the Black Panther
Party as being weak,


1769
01:32:42.934 --> 01:32:45.071
and it didn't have
any more muscle,


1770
01:32:45.103 --> 01:32:48.874
and it was a reform
organization, a breakfast


1771
01:32:48.907 --> 01:32:51.844
for children club,
and he denounced the Party


1772
01:32:51.877 --> 01:32:54.046
and he denounced the
administrator... chief


1773
01:32:54.080 --> 01:32:55.881
administrator of the
Party at that time, who


1774
01:32:55.915 --> 01:32:57.216
was David Hilliard.

1775
01:32:57.250 --> 01:33:00.620
He wanted to have even more
blood shed, which was not


1776
01:33:00.652 --> 01:33:03.622
endearing us to the community.

1777
01:33:03.656 --> 01:33:06.059
There were also problems
with the Panther 21


1778
01:33:06.091 --> 01:33:06.759
case.

1779
01:33:06.791 --> 01:33:08.294
There were legal fees.

1780
01:33:08.327 --> 01:33:10.563
And there became questions
about how much of the money


1781
01:33:10.595 --> 01:33:12.631
that was raised
for the Panther 21


1782
01:33:12.665 --> 01:33:16.368
was actually getting back
to defend the Panther 21.


1783
01:33:16.402 --> 01:33:20.640
We wrote an open letter really
criticizing national leadership


1784
01:33:20.672 --> 01:33:23.276
and Huey P. Newton.

1785
01:33:23.309 --> 01:33:24.978
And the response of
national leadership...


1786
01:33:25.010 --> 01:33:26.578
and in particular
Huey P. Newton...


1787
01:33:26.612 --> 01:33:28.815
was to kick out the Panther 21.

1788
01:33:28.848 --> 01:33:32.252
They were expelled
from the Panther Party.


1789
01:33:32.285 --> 01:33:36.788
Eldridge came to the
defense of the Panther 21.


1790
01:33:36.822 --> 01:33:38.691
The Black Panther

1791
01:33:38.724 --> 01:33:42.194
Party has split it into two
factions, namely the Cleaver


1792
01:33:42.228 --> 01:33:44.964
and Newton supporters.

1793
01:33:44.996 --> 01:33:48.066
This dissension offers an
exceptional opportunity


1794
01:33:48.099 --> 01:33:50.736
to aggravate and
possibly neutralize


1795
01:33:50.769 --> 01:33:53.171
through counterintelligence.

1796
01:33:53.205 --> 01:33:56.876
The FBI was picking at Huey
and picking at Eldridge.


1797
01:33:56.908 --> 01:33:58.810
And I don't know who
else they were picking at


1798
01:33:58.844 --> 01:34:01.281
to create this
sense of distrust.


1799
01:34:01.313 --> 01:34:03.081
In the future,

1800
01:34:03.115 --> 01:34:06.352
submit counterintelligence
proposals against the Cleaver


1801
01:34:06.385 --> 01:34:09.355
faction in the Black
Panther Party designed


1802
01:34:09.388 --> 01:34:12.292
to widen the existing
rift, effectively


1803
01:34:12.325 --> 01:34:17.764
driving a wedge between
Newton and Eldridge Cleaver.


1804
01:34:17.796 --> 01:34:21.767
Ensure this mailing cannot
be traced to the Bureau.


1805
01:34:21.800 --> 01:34:24.002
What we thought
the FBI wanted to do


1806
01:34:24.036 --> 01:34:28.107
was kill us, blow up
our offices, shoot us.


1807
01:34:28.139 --> 01:34:31.209
I don't think we
understood exactly how


1808
01:34:31.242 --> 01:34:34.713
insidious their project was.

1809
01:34:34.746 --> 01:34:36.915
They created a
culture of paranoia


1810
01:34:36.948 --> 01:34:38.617
which was
incredibly destructive.


1811
01:34:38.651 --> 01:34:41.487
In this sense, it was the
ultimate intelligence success,


1812
01:34:41.519 --> 01:34:43.990
being able to pit the
Party against itself.


1813
01:34:44.023 --> 01:34:45.725
And the Panthers
internal conflict


1814
01:34:45.758 --> 01:34:48.694
would soon erupt in
the mainstream media.


1815
01:34:48.728 --> 01:34:50.330
Good morning.

1816
01:34:50.362 --> 01:34:52.965
Yes, it's AM all
right, and this is


1817
01:34:52.999 --> 01:34:55.335
Jim Dunbar with Nancy
Fleming and Gary Bentley.


1818
01:34:55.367 --> 01:34:58.136
We had become
aware of some sort


1819
01:34:58.170 --> 01:35:06.245
of a rift that had come to
pass between Huey and Eldridge.


1820
01:35:06.277 --> 01:35:10.582
We had booked Huey and
arranged the call from Eldridge


1821
01:35:10.616 --> 01:35:15.153
in Algeria to take
advantage of that.


1822
01:35:15.187 --> 01:35:18.291
We've got lots of things coming
up here on AM this morning...


1823
01:35:18.323 --> 01:35:19.892
lots of things that
you'll like to see,


1824
01:35:19.925 --> 01:35:22.428
and we're looking forward to
them too, right here on AM.


1825
01:35:22.460 --> 01:35:24.629
I'll not try to sugarcoat this.

1826
01:35:24.662 --> 01:35:28.166
We thought this is a wonderful
opportunity to build audience,


1827
01:35:28.200 --> 01:35:30.903
and so we decided to go
ahead and put the two of them


1828
01:35:30.935 --> 01:35:31.337
together.

1829
01:35:59.965 --> 01:36:02.835
Huey's goal in having
Eldridge on the show


1830
01:36:02.867 --> 01:36:06.438
was to show people that he and
Eldridge were on the same page.


1831
01:36:06.471 --> 01:36:09.809
And Eldridge sabotaged
that, so Huey was livid.


1832
01:36:09.841 --> 01:36:11.576
He was embarrassed.

1833
01:36:11.609 --> 01:36:13.345
He was furious.

1834
01:36:13.379 --> 01:36:16.783
And so within 10 minutes
or so he called back.


1835
01:37:01.193 --> 01:37:04.030
It was a split in the
party, and within days we


1836
01:37:04.063 --> 01:37:06.265
began to feel just
how bad it was.


1837
01:37:06.297 --> 01:37:09.734
Someone has to be disciplined,
and my recommendation


1838
01:37:09.768 --> 01:37:12.738
is to discipline
Eldridge Cleaver...


1839
01:37:12.770 --> 01:37:15.174
not for the criticism
itself, but,


1840
01:37:15.206 --> 01:37:18.611
the way in which
it was presented.


1841
01:37:18.644 --> 01:37:20.279
The
word got back to us


1842
01:37:20.312 --> 01:37:22.814
that Eldridge had put out the
edict that the streets were not


1843
01:37:22.848 --> 01:37:24.817
supposed to safe for Panthers.

1844
01:37:24.849 --> 01:37:28.987
Whether he said that or not...
he was in Algeria, we were here.


1845
01:37:29.020 --> 01:37:29.921
Who knows?

1846
01:37:29.955 --> 01:37:30.823
It was chaos.

1847
01:37:36.594 --> 01:37:40.599
It was certain chapters
that stayed with Huey.


1848
01:37:40.633 --> 01:37:43.568
Many of the people who followed
Eldridge leave the party


1849
01:37:43.602 --> 01:37:45.671
and go underground.

1850
01:37:45.703 --> 01:37:48.006
And then some people just
were confused and frustrated


1851
01:37:48.040 --> 01:37:49.341
and walked away.

1852
01:37:49.375 --> 01:37:51.676
They don't know which faction
of the Black Panther Party


1853
01:37:51.710 --> 01:37:55.247
to follow or if they should
deal with Panthers at all.


1854
01:37:58.550 --> 01:38:01.853
The Party
had leaders who at that point


1855
01:38:01.886 --> 01:38:05.191
were not worthy of the
dedication of their followers.


1856
01:38:05.224 --> 01:38:08.060
And I think that
that was probably


1857
01:38:08.093 --> 01:38:10.529
the worst aspect
of the Party, is


1858
01:38:10.563 --> 01:38:12.098
that I think some
of the followers


1859
01:38:12.130 --> 01:38:14.200
felt betrayed by their leaders.

1860
01:38:17.202 --> 01:38:22.541
And the split becomes so deep
that it erupts, in some cases,


1861
01:38:22.575 --> 01:38:25.810
into violence, into fights
and into shootings,


1862
01:38:25.844 --> 01:38:26.679
between Panthers.

1863
01:38:30.549 --> 01:38:32.818
This is exactly
what the Bureau, in fact,


1864
01:38:32.850 --> 01:38:35.453
wanted to see happen
in the first place.


1865
01:38:35.487 --> 01:38:38.791
This was part of what the
COINTELPRO operations were


1866
01:38:38.823 --> 01:38:39.791
really all about.

1867
01:38:42.428 --> 01:38:44.764
J. Edgar Hoover,
in particular, says


1868
01:38:44.796 --> 01:38:47.066
we've been pitting people
against each other.


1869
01:38:47.099 --> 01:38:48.768
That's all worked
out really well.


1870
01:38:48.800 --> 01:38:51.903
But you know, now we don't even
have to worry about it anymore.


1871
01:38:51.937 --> 01:38:54.540
Now they're just going to
keep it going on their own


1872
01:38:54.572 --> 01:38:56.575
and we can step
back a little bit


1873
01:38:56.608 --> 01:38:59.411
and just let them play it out.

1874
01:39:03.381 --> 01:39:04.884
In the midst of all
of this turmoil,


1875
01:39:04.916 --> 01:39:07.754
the Panthers decide to go in a
really radically new direction.


1876
01:39:10.622 --> 01:39:12.457
Bobby Seale, the
Black Panther leader,


1877
01:39:12.491 --> 01:39:14.961
has been in trouble with
the law for many years.


1878
01:39:14.993 --> 01:39:18.363
He's been in prison on some
charges, acquitted on others.


1879
01:39:18.397 --> 01:39:21.300
And now he's trying to make
a new career for himself.


1880
01:39:21.332 --> 01:39:23.568
He wants to be mayor
of Oakland, California,


1881
01:39:23.602 --> 01:39:25.938
where the Black
Panther movement began.


1882
01:39:25.970 --> 01:39:26.973
It
was nice meeting you.


1883
01:39:27.005 --> 01:39:28.173
OK,
nice meeting you.


1884
01:39:28.206 --> 01:39:28.807
All right, then.

1885
01:39:28.840 --> 01:39:29.142
How you all doing?

1886
01:39:36.247 --> 01:39:37.683
The Panthers decide

1887
01:39:37.715 --> 01:39:40.752
to call members to
Oakland in an effort


1888
01:39:40.786 --> 01:39:43.756
to run Bobby Seale for mayor
of Oakland and Elaine Brown


1889
01:39:43.788 --> 01:39:45.925
for city council.

1890
01:39:45.957 --> 01:39:48.393
Don Seale,
member of the central committee


1891
01:39:48.426 --> 01:39:50.763
of the Black Panther
Party, called me


1892
01:39:50.795 --> 01:39:53.765
at the Baltimore
chapter office and told


1893
01:39:53.799 --> 01:39:58.203
me to begin closing down
all of our programs.


1894
01:39:58.237 --> 01:40:04.310
So we were instructed to cease
and desist all Party operations


1895
01:40:04.343 --> 01:40:06.679
and to bring as
many Party members


1896
01:40:06.711 --> 01:40:08.848
from Baltimore out to
Oakland as possible.


1897
01:40:11.849 --> 01:40:13.486
Ultimately they roll the die.

1898
01:40:13.519 --> 01:40:17.456
They assume that if they're
successful in this campaign,


1899
01:40:17.488 --> 01:40:19.524
this might help to transform
one American city.


1900
01:40:19.558 --> 01:40:22.662
This might be the
blueprint for the future.


1901
01:40:22.694 --> 01:40:24.029
But they do roll the die.

1902
01:40:24.063 --> 01:40:26.832
The numbers were
dwindling, and therefore


1903
01:40:26.865 --> 01:40:29.468
the force of the
Party was dwindling.


1904
01:40:29.501 --> 01:40:33.239
So it only made sense to
consolidate everything


1905
01:40:33.272 --> 01:40:36.975
and to say, what can we
do with what we have?


1906
01:40:37.009 --> 01:40:38.611
We laid down the
guns two years ago.


1907
01:40:38.644 --> 01:40:40.246
We don't need guns,
we said, because we


1908
01:40:40.278 --> 01:40:42.747
knew we had the ability to
really organize and educate


1909
01:40:42.781 --> 01:40:45.017
the people and
show them, really,


1910
01:40:45.050 --> 01:40:48.120
some of the concrete things
we can do in the community.


1911
01:40:48.152 --> 01:40:49.888
Initially, the
idea of Bobby running for mayor


1912
01:40:49.921 --> 01:40:50.555
seemed ridiculous.

1913
01:40:53.192 --> 01:40:54.993
Black Panther
leader Bobby Seale


1914
01:40:55.027 --> 01:40:58.764
ran second in his race for
mayor of Oakland, California,


1915
01:40:58.796 --> 01:41:00.265
but Seale polled
just enough votes


1916
01:41:00.299 --> 01:41:03.169
to force a runoff with the
conservative incumbent John


1917
01:41:03.202 --> 01:41:04.236
Reading.

1918
01:41:04.269 --> 01:41:05.071
I think we were shocked

1919
01:41:05.103 --> 01:41:06.438
when he ended up in a runoff.

1920
01:41:06.471 --> 01:41:09.341
But as we got into
the campaign and as he


1921
01:41:09.375 --> 01:41:11.810
started doing his campaign
runs, as Elaine started


1922
01:41:11.844 --> 01:41:14.380
doing her campaign speeches,
as people started getting...


1923
01:41:14.412 --> 01:41:17.649
we started galvanizing
people's enthusiasm,


1924
01:41:17.683 --> 01:41:19.118
it started looking
like he might win.


1925
01:41:34.433 --> 01:41:37.002
Part of the
strategy for the campaign


1926
01:41:37.035 --> 01:41:39.904
was to increase the
number of black voters


1927
01:41:39.938 --> 01:41:42.408
on the rolls in Oakland.

1928
01:41:42.441 --> 01:41:45.077
We sent people out into the
community going door to door,


1929
01:41:45.109 --> 01:41:48.781
walking the streets,
registering people to vote en masse.


1930
01:41:48.813 --> 01:41:50.515
And we
went to the churches,


1931
01:41:50.549 --> 01:41:53.486
and we went to the dope houses,
and we went to the streets,


1932
01:41:53.519 --> 01:41:55.588
and we went everywhere
where the people were,


1933
01:41:55.621 --> 01:42:00.693
trying to organize people to
vote for Bobby and Elaine.


1934
01:42:04.595 --> 01:42:06.698
They run
an amazing campaign.


1935
01:42:06.732 --> 01:42:08.934
Bobby Seale used to
ride buses in Oakland


1936
01:42:08.966 --> 01:42:10.669
and do stump speaking
on the bus.


1937
01:42:10.702 --> 01:42:13.039
And they really took it to the
streets in a different way.


1938
01:42:16.008 --> 01:42:17.675
Bobby
had made a promise


1939
01:42:17.709 --> 01:42:20.412
that he was going to give
away 10,000 bags of groceries


1940
01:42:20.446 --> 01:42:22.415
with a chicken in every bag.

1941
01:42:22.447 --> 01:42:25.417
And that was a takeoff on
FDR's a chicken in every pot.


1942
01:42:27.652 --> 01:42:29.421
We counted
up and we found out


1943
01:42:29.455 --> 01:42:33.826
last night it was 6,882 bags we
actually gave away last night.


1944
01:42:33.858 --> 01:42:36.661
And I think that the
voter registration is


1945
01:42:36.694 --> 01:42:38.531
running neck and neck with it.

1946
01:42:38.563 --> 01:42:41.099
I'm sure of that, because of a
lot of... it blew our minds,


1947
01:42:41.133 --> 01:42:42.968
so many black people in
the black community's


1948
01:42:43.001 --> 01:42:43.836
unregistered to vote.

1949
01:42:46.537 --> 01:42:48.206
It was amazing, because they

1950
01:42:48.240 --> 01:42:50.675
were able to register between

1951
01:42:50.709 --> 01:42:51.810
to vote.

1952
01:42:51.844 --> 01:42:54.313
They basically turned
their survival programs


1953
01:42:54.345 --> 01:42:55.947
into a get out the
vote apparatus.


1954
01:43:07.125 --> 01:43:10.062
But in the end,
it wasn't enough.


1955
01:43:10.094 --> 01:43:12.697
Mayor John Reading
of Oakland, California


1956
01:43:12.730 --> 01:43:16.301
was reelected yesterday in a
runoff against Bobby Seale,


1957
01:43:16.335 --> 01:43:17.736
the Black Panther leader.

1958
01:43:17.769 --> 01:43:19.071
Don Oliver has that story.

1959
01:43:21.773 --> 01:43:23.809
Looking at the mood
in Bobby Seale's


1960
01:43:23.841 --> 01:43:25.877
headquarters, you would
have thought he won.


1961
01:43:25.911 --> 01:43:27.246
You know what somebody told me?

1962
01:43:27.278 --> 01:43:28.613
What did they tell us, Bobby?

1963
01:43:28.647 --> 01:43:31.283
They say, we don't care
how the election goes.


1964
01:43:31.316 --> 01:43:32.651
Bobby Seale is for.

1965
01:43:32.684 --> 01:43:34.286
And they told me
this, it blew my mind.


1966
01:43:34.318 --> 01:43:37.121
You're still our mayor, and
we're going to.


1967
01:43:40.125 --> 01:43:41.493
Power to the people.

1968
01:43:44.563 --> 01:43:47.433
Plan A was for
Bobby to win, Elaine to win,


1969
01:43:47.465 --> 01:43:49.767
and our slate to win.

1970
01:43:49.800 --> 01:43:55.073
There wasn't... as far as I
could remember... a plan B.


1971
01:43:55.107 --> 01:44:01.479
Once we lost the campaign
there was kind of a...


1972
01:44:01.513 --> 01:44:02.113
there was a void.

1973
01:44:05.250 --> 01:44:07.886
It was
in theory a great idea


1974
01:44:07.920 --> 01:44:10.623
that you could marshal
this army of organizers


1975
01:44:10.656 --> 01:44:11.924
to come to Oakland.

1976
01:44:11.956 --> 01:44:14.893
But for the most part, when
all the chapters come back


1977
01:44:14.926 --> 01:44:17.830
to Oakland, the Panthers
as a national phenomena


1978
01:44:17.862 --> 01:44:19.731
really, cease.

1979
01:44:24.969 --> 01:44:26.871
After the elections in Oakland,

1980
01:44:26.904 --> 01:44:30.776
Huey Newton is known to
have some erratic behavior.


1981
01:44:30.809 --> 01:44:32.144
People who were
very close to him


1982
01:44:32.176 --> 01:44:35.514
would say that it depends
on the day you meet him.


1983
01:44:35.546 --> 01:44:39.183
Some days Huey Newton could
be a brilliant, thoughtful


1984
01:44:39.216 --> 01:44:41.452
political strategist and
committed to the liberation


1985
01:44:41.486 --> 01:44:43.555
of the black people,
and another day he


1986
01:44:43.589 --> 01:44:45.323
could be self-serving
and thuggish.


1987
01:44:45.357 --> 01:44:49.094
I was one of the folks who
oriented new Panther members,


1988
01:44:49.126 --> 01:44:51.095
and I oriented them
by telling them


1989
01:44:51.129 --> 01:44:54.233
about what a wonderful
person Huey was


1990
01:44:54.265 --> 01:44:57.268
and about how he was
the leader of our party,


1991
01:44:57.301 --> 01:45:01.272
never knowing what
the hell he was.


1992
01:45:01.305 --> 01:45:05.910
We had created the cult of the
personality around a fucking


1993
01:45:05.943 --> 01:45:06.344
maniac.

1994
01:45:09.214 --> 01:45:11.283
He surrounded himself
with former prisoners,


1995
01:45:11.316 --> 01:45:14.687
and they became
his inner retinue.


1996
01:45:17.288 --> 01:45:23.027
Around 1973,
we created a special unit


1997
01:45:23.060 --> 01:45:26.497
that would protect
our leaders and do


1998
01:45:26.531 --> 01:45:29.868
other kinds of
activities related


1999
01:45:29.901 --> 01:45:34.238
to what Huey Newton called
the sterner stuff of politics.


2000
01:45:34.272 --> 01:45:35.908
We're going to take
over the underworld,


2001
01:45:35.941 --> 01:45:39.877
the underground apparatus
of the city of Oakland.


2002
01:45:39.911 --> 01:45:44.249
We were shaking down
the drug dealers, pimps.


2003
01:45:44.282 --> 01:45:47.819
Some people were
like, stick up men.


2004
01:45:47.853 --> 01:45:49.589
It was bringing in revenue.

2005
01:45:52.924 --> 01:45:55.594
As he became
more and more addicted


2006
01:45:55.626 --> 01:46:00.698
to multiple substances, I
don't think he wanted to live


2007
01:46:00.732 --> 01:46:04.202
and I don't think he wanted
the Party to live anymore.


2008
01:46:04.236 --> 01:46:09.174
From there on, you know, he was
less and less the Huey I knew,


2009
01:46:09.206 --> 01:46:15.613
and more and more
listening to his demons.


2010
01:46:15.647 --> 01:46:17.349
If
Huey wanted to see you


2011
01:46:17.381 --> 01:46:18.783
or you wanted to
see Huey, you had


2012
01:46:18.817 --> 01:46:21.754
to come to his penthouse,
which meant that you went up


2013
01:46:21.786 --> 01:46:24.155
in his elevator, which
meant that you were searched


2014
01:46:24.188 --> 01:46:25.390
before you got up there.

2015
01:46:25.424 --> 01:46:26.792
And when you got
up there then you


2016
01:46:26.825 --> 01:46:30.461
were confronted by this
maniac in his penthouse


2017
01:46:30.495 --> 01:46:35.166
who did all kinds of things
to people... physical assault,


2018
01:46:35.200 --> 01:46:39.037
sexual assault, pistol whipping,
threatening to kill.


2019
01:46:41.706 --> 01:46:45.111
He also became very abusive
to the people around him.


2020
01:46:48.045 --> 01:46:49.381
He abused people like Bobby.

2021
01:46:52.317 --> 01:46:55.854
There were changes
in the organization.


2022
01:46:55.886 --> 01:46:57.288
Bobby Seale left.

2023
01:46:57.322 --> 01:46:59.758
There were a lot of people who
had been in the organization


2024
01:46:59.791 --> 01:47:02.795
from the beginning,
and, and they left.


2025
01:47:04.830 --> 01:47:06.365
Then
there was a time


2026
01:47:06.398 --> 01:47:13.471
when he was violent with
me, and that was why


2027
01:47:13.505 --> 01:47:17.475
I left the Black Panther Party.

2028
01:47:17.509 --> 01:47:20.746
I said goodbye as
I left, but I left.


2029
01:47:24.116 --> 01:47:26.618
Dear Huey,
I've been in the party


2030
01:47:26.651 --> 01:47:29.321
for 9 and 1/2 years,
but I've come


2031
01:47:29.353 --> 01:47:31.456
to a crossroads in my life.

2032
01:47:31.490 --> 01:47:34.259
One path is the Party
and the other path


2033
01:47:34.291 --> 01:47:35.460
is my personal happiness.

2034
01:47:35.493 --> 01:47:37.295
I know you're busy,

2035
01:47:37.328 --> 01:47:39.497
but I see our
party falling apart


2036
01:47:39.531 --> 01:47:42.434
and nothing is being done
to stop this from happening.


2037
01:47:42.466 --> 01:47:44.202
It was absolutely devastating

2038
01:47:44.236 --> 01:47:47.740
for me to leave the
Black Panther Party.


2039
01:47:47.773 --> 01:47:50.542
I felt guilty that I
hadn't, you know,


2040
01:47:50.575 --> 01:47:52.678
stayed to do something...
I wasn't sure what.


2041
01:47:56.014 --> 01:47:57.149
There was no other life.

2042
01:47:57.182 --> 01:47:59.452
There was no other
thing greater.


2043
01:48:03.321 --> 01:48:04.790
Then I learned to
live in a world


2044
01:48:04.822 --> 01:48:09.927
where there was no
Black Panther Party.


2045
01:48:09.960 --> 01:48:11.896
Our
children are growing up.


2046
01:48:11.929 --> 01:48:14.265
Half the children don't
know their parents,


2047
01:48:14.299 --> 01:48:17.569
or their parents don't
know their children.


2048
01:48:17.602 --> 01:48:19.872
I want to spend more
time with my son.


2049
01:48:19.904 --> 01:48:22.508
So many are on
the verge of leaving because we


2050
01:48:22.541 --> 01:48:25.277
suffer from loneliness,
lack of personal lives


2051
01:48:25.309 --> 01:48:27.612
and extreme poverty.

2052
01:48:27.645 --> 01:48:29.615
Everybody wanted
this gun toting


2053
01:48:29.648 --> 01:48:34.620
image of the big black...
big bad black Shaft guy


2054
01:48:34.652 --> 01:48:36.287
jumping through the
window and then, you


2055
01:48:36.321 --> 01:48:38.422
know, beating everybody up.

2056
01:48:38.456 --> 01:48:45.564
I refute that as the image
that was put upon us.


2057
01:48:45.596 --> 01:48:47.698
I'm not Shaft.

2058
01:48:47.732 --> 01:48:51.069
You know, as a black
man, that's all I am.


2059
01:48:51.102 --> 01:48:54.773
I'm just a black man.

2060
01:48:54.805 --> 01:48:56.575
Dear Huey, you know

2061
01:48:56.608 --> 01:49:00.312
I trust that I have felt a
virtually infinite respect for,


2062
01:49:00.344 --> 01:49:04.415
belief in, support of
the Black Panther Party.


2063
01:49:04.448 --> 01:49:09.720
I meant well... God knows I
meant well and tried... them too.


2064
01:49:09.754 --> 01:49:13.158
Haven't we all,
one way or another?


2065
01:49:13.191 --> 01:49:15.760
The great strength of
the Black Panther Party


2066
01:49:15.794 --> 01:49:20.832
was its ideals and its
youthful vigor and enthusiasm.


2067
01:49:20.866 --> 01:49:22.401
The great weakness
of the Party was


2068
01:49:22.434 --> 01:49:26.505
its ideals and its youthful
vigor and its enthusiasm.


2069
01:49:26.537 --> 01:49:28.339
That sometimes can
be very dangerous,


2070
01:49:28.372 --> 01:49:30.474
especially when you're up
against the United States


2071
01:49:30.508 --> 01:49:31.910
government.

2072
01:49:55.934 --> 01:49:57.402
If there's anything

2073
01:49:57.434 --> 01:49:59.904
I can do that would truly
progress the people,


2074
01:49:59.938 --> 01:50:01.773
let me know.

2075
01:50:01.805 --> 01:50:04.308
I may not be a member of
the Black Panther Party,


2076
01:50:04.341 --> 01:50:07.879
but I will always
be a Black Panther.


2077
01:50:07.912 --> 01:50:09.647
All power to the people.

2078
01:50:09.680 --> 01:50:12.050
Peace and freedom to the world.

2079
01:50:16.587 --> 01:50:18.956
We made mistakes.

2080
01:50:18.990 --> 01:50:23.127
We charged ahead too fast and
were too arrogant sometimes.


2081
01:50:23.161 --> 01:50:29.067
We certainly underestimated
the police and the government


2082
01:50:29.099 --> 01:50:33.337
in terms of their response
to the Black Panther Party.


2083
01:50:33.371 --> 01:50:36.742
But I think what remains true,
the central guiding principle,


2084
01:50:36.774 --> 01:50:40.179
was an undying love
for the people.


2085
01:51:17.215 --> 01:51:19.217
The Black Panther Party platform

2086
01:51:19.250 --> 01:51:24.221
and program... what we
want, what we believe.


2087
01:51:24.255 --> 01:51:28.527
We want decent housing fit for
the shelter of human beings.


2088
01:51:32.529 --> 01:51:34.366
We want education
for our people.


2089
01:51:37.469 --> 01:51:39.604
We want an immediate end

2090
01:51:39.636 --> 01:51:42.707
to police brutality and
murder of black people.


2091
01:51:46.044 --> 01:51:51.450
We what land, bread, housing,
education, clothing, justice,


2092
01:51:51.483 --> 01:51:52.584
peace.
