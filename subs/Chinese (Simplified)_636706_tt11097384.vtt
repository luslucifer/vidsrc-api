[people applauding]


20
00:02:58.635 --> 00:03:04.385
我代表欧洲太空计划和捷克人民，
On behalf of the Euro Space Program and the Czech people,


21
00:03:04.468 --> 00:03:10.676
你独自旅行的第189天，

22
00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:13.176
欢迎回来，指挥官Procházka。
welcome back, Commander Procházka.


23
00:03:16.176 --> 00:03:19.051
Tuma专员。来自木星外围的你好。
Commissioner Tuma. Hello from the outskirts of Jupiter.


24
00:03:19.135 --> 00:03:21.676
我很高兴能在这里和你交谈。
I'm very excited to be talking to you from here.


25
00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:24.593
再次见到你真是太好了。你气色不错。
It's so great to see you again. You look well.


26
00:03:24.676 --> 00:03:28.051
看来漫长的等待即将结束。
It seems like the long wait is coming to an end.


27
00:03:28.135 --> 00:03:29.926
(轻声地笑)是的，没错。
[chuckles softly] Yes, that is correct.


28
00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:32.760
这次旅行的原因就在我面前。
The reason for this journey is right in front of me.


29
00:03:33.843 --> 00:03:37.426
我确信我传回来的照片并不能很好地展现它。
I'm sure the images I've sent back doesn't do it justice.


30
00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:41.635
但乔普拉云比你想象的更令人惊讶。
But the Chopra Cloud is more astonishing than what you could ever imagine.


31
00:03:42.385 --> 00:03:44.593
我希望你们都能像我一样看待它。
I wish you could all see it the way I do.


32
00:03:44.676 --> 00:03:48.260
这种现象在过去的四年里一直困扰着我们的天空，
[Tuma] This phenomenon has haunted our skies for the past four years,


33
00:03:48.343 --> 00:03:50.801
现在你的照片吸引了全世界。
and now your images have captivated the world.


34
00:03:51.385 --> 00:03:52.760
真正壮观。
Truly spectacular.


35
00:03:52.843 --> 00:03:53.760
(温柔的笑)
[chuckles softly]


36
00:03:53.843 --> 00:03:55.718
不到一个星期，
Well, in less than a week,


37
00:03:55.801 --> 00:03:59.551
我会收集并分析构成云层的粒子。
I will collect and analyze the particles that make up the cloud.


38
00:04:00.135 --> 00:04:02.510
我们仍然不知道它们是什么，也不知道它们来自哪里。
We still don't know what they are or where they come from.


39
00:04:02.593 --> 00:04:05.385
但当我进入乔普拉云时，
But as I enter the Chopra Cloud,


40
00:04:05.468 --> 00:04:09.260
我可能会解开宇宙的一些谜团。
I might just unravel some mysteries of the universe.


41
00:04:10.176 --> 00:04:13.510
指挥官，你介意回答几个问题吗
Commander, would you mind taking a few questions


42
00:04:13.593 --> 00:04:15.260
从世界人民那里?
from the people of the world?


43
00:04:15.843 --> 00:04:16.926
我会尽力的。
I'll do my best.


44
00:04:17.718 --> 00:04:20.093
[女孩]你好，我叫安娜。
[girl] Hello, my name is Anna.


45
00:04:20.176 --> 00:04:21.718
我上六年级了。
I'm in sixth grade.


46
00:04:21.801 --> 00:04:24.468
我读到你是世界上最孤独的人。
And I read that you're the loneliest man in the world.


47
00:04:25.718 --> 00:04:26.551
(温柔的笑)
[chuckles softly]


48
00:04:26.635 --> 00:04:29.676
我想安娜的意思是指挥官
I think what Anna here is saying is that the commander


49
00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:32.135
是历史上离任何人都最远的。
is the farthest away from anyone in history.


50
00:04:32.218 --> 00:04:33.760
你是这个意思吗?
Is that what you mean?


51
00:04:34.426 --> 00:04:36.635
这么远的地方会让你难过吗?
Does it make you sad to be so far away?


52
00:04:36.718 --> 00:04:39.968
我在5亿公里之外。
Well, I am some 500 million kilometers away.


53
00:04:40.635 --> 00:04:44.718
是的，这是一个单独的任务，但我知道我很快就会回来的。
And yes, this is a solo mission, but I know I'll be coming back soon.


54
00:04:44.801 --> 00:04:48.885
我已经接近预定返回地球的一半了，
I'm nearing the halfway mark for my scheduled return to Earth,


55
00:04:48.968 --> 00:04:50.510
我有很多工作要做
and I have so much work to do.


56
00:04:51.218 --> 00:04:53.510
我可以和来自世界各地的人交谈
And I get to talk to people from all over the world


57
00:04:53.593 --> 00:04:55.926
就像你和任务控制中心。
like you and Mission Control.


58
00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:57.635
当然还有你的妻子，伦卡。
And your wife, Lenka, of course.


59
00:05:01.968 --> 00:05:04.635
她和我可以通过CzechConnect量子网络聊天
She and I can talk over the CzechConnect Quantum


60
00:05:04.718 --> 00:05:06.510
比光速还快
faster than the Speed of Light Phone,


61
00:05:07.093 --> 00:05:09.051
这让我们保持联系。
which keeps us connected.


62
00:05:10.176 --> 00:05:11.468
我们每天都聊天。
We talk every day.


63
00:05:12.051 --> 00:05:15.551
我所做的一切都是为了家乡的每一个人，这让我非常自豪。
What I'm doing is for everyone back home, and that makes me very proud.


64
00:05:16.635 --> 00:05:19.426
不，我不是世界上最孤独的人。
No, I'm not the loneliest man in the world.


65
00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:21.010
谢谢你，安娜。
Thank you, Anna.


66
00:05:21.093 --> 00:05:22.635
谢谢你，指挥官。
And thank you, Commander.


67
00:05:23.468 --> 00:05:25.843
我们在这里休息一下，
We're going to take a short break here,


68
00:05:25.926 --> 00:05:30.135
我们将在慷慨的赞助商致辞后回来。
and we'll be back after a word from our generous sponsors.

[narrator] Non-drowsy Antiquease,

[忧郁的音乐播放]
[melancholy music playing]


74
00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:51.301
你会没事的，雅各布。
[Lenka] You'll be all right, Jakub.


75
00:05:52.093 --> 00:05:54.010
你不害怕独自一人。
You're not afraid to be on your own.


76
00:05:55.218 --> 00:05:56.426
我很害怕，
I was afraid,


77
00:05:58.051 --> 00:05:59.135
但我已经不是了。
but I'm not anymore.


78
00:06:02.135 --> 00:06:03.010
(抽泣)
[sniffles]


79
00:06:03.551 --> 00:06:04.635
(啜泣)我爱你。
[sobbing] I love you.


80
00:06:06.551 --> 00:06:07.885
但是人是会变的。
But people change.


81
00:06:09.301 --> 00:06:11.885
如果你不让他们改变，他们就会死。
And if you don't let them change, they die.


82
00:06:13.635 --> 00:06:14.510
(抽泣)
[sniffles]


83
00:06:16.885 --> 00:06:18.718
(哭)我必须离开你。
[cries] I have to leave you.


84
00:06:20.676 --> 00:06:24.010
我很抱歉必须是现在，但是
I'm so sorry it has to be now, but--


85
00:06:28.343 --> 00:06:29.176
(哔哔声)
[beeps]


86

(线响)
[line ringing]


87
00:06:32.801 --> 00:06:33.760
(人)是吗?
[man] Yes?


88
00:06:34.385 --> 00:06:35.426
Lenka问题。
Lenka problem.


89
00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:37.885
(机器转动)
[machine whirring]


90
00:06:45.718 --> 00:06:47.718
[呼呼声增强，停止]
[whirring intensifies, stops]


91
00:06:53.051 --> 00:06:58.885
彼得，你能同意再修一次厕所吗?
Peter, would you be so kind to approve another repair to the toilet?


92
00:06:58.968 --> 00:07:01.843
(叹气)让我看看能不能让工程部澄清一下。
[sighs] Let me see if I can get engineering to clear that.


93
00:07:01.926 --> 00:07:03.885
你按我们建议的换了o形圈了吗?
Did you replace the O-rings like we suggested?


94
00:07:03.968 --> 00:07:05.385
是的，我做了。
Yes, I did.


95
00:07:05.468 --> 00:07:06.968
它还在尖叫。
And it's still screaming.


96
00:07:07.051 --> 00:07:08.718
也许你和我以后可以解决这个问题。
Maybe you and I can troubleshoot it later.


97
00:07:08.801 --> 00:07:12.510
但命令是要优先处理坏掉的摄像头，所以…
But the orders are that the broken cameras take priority over the toilet, so…


98
00:07:13.926 --> 00:07:16.176
你昨晚什么时候吃的安眠药?
When did you take your sleep drops last night?


99
00:07:16.676 --> 00:07:18.135
8:30。为什么?

100
00:07:18.218 --> 00:07:20.635
你看起来不太好。你睡觉了吗?
You don't look so good. Did you sleep?


101
00:07:20.718 --> 00:07:21.843
我试过了。
I tried.


102
00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:24.343
但也许我看起来像坨屎
But just maybe I look like shit


103
00:07:24.426 --> 00:07:27.010
因为厕所总是搅乱我的夜晚。
because the toilet keeps fucking up my nights.


104
00:07:27.093 --> 00:07:28.551
[彼得]好的，我明白了。
[Peter] Okay, I hear you.


105
00:07:29.426 --> 00:07:32.468
但是尽量找时间打个盹。你需要休息。
But try to find time for a nap. You need rest.


106
00:07:35.843 --> 00:07:37.843
你们有Lenka的消息吗?
[Jakub] Have you guys heard from Lenka?


107
00:07:38.968 --> 00:07:40.468
不。为什么?
No. Why?


108
00:07:41.093 --> 00:07:42.843
[忧郁的音乐播放]

111
00:08:18.176 --> 00:08:19.135
(机器进入)
[machine whooshes]


112
00:08:20.343 --> 00:08:22.718
(Lenka对着笔记本电脑)我知道你能感觉到寂静。
[Lenka over laptop] I know you can feel the silence.


113
00:08:22.801 --> 00:08:23.676
(抽泣)
[sniffles]


114
00:08:23.760 --> 00:08:25.676
(叹气)天哪，天哪。
[sighs] Oh my, oh my.


115
00:08:25.760 --> 00:08:27.926
[Lenka]我们都在CzechConnect上…
[Lenka] We're both on the CzechConnect and…


116
00:08:29.343 --> 00:08:30.760
只有寂静。
there's just silence.


117
00:08:33.426 --> 00:08:34.676
那么重点是什么呢?
So what's the point?


118
00:08:36.718 --> 00:08:39.718
他承受着巨大的压力。他没有睡觉。
He is under tremendous pressure. He isn't sleeping.


119
00:08:43.218 --> 00:08:44.760
他听不懂这个信息。
He's not getting this message.


120
00:08:47.176 --> 00:08:48.926
-我们在隐瞒?——(Tuma)嗯。
-We're holding it back? -[Tuma] Hm.


121
00:08:50.635 --> 00:08:53.426
(叹气)他已经开始担心没有她的消息了。
[sighs] He's already concerned he hasn't heard from her.


122
00:08:53.510 --> 00:08:55.426
他听不懂这个信息。
He's not getting this message.


123
00:08:56.135 --> 00:08:58.135
我去和她谈谈。
I'll go talk to her.


124
00:09:00.218 --> 00:09:02.051
我会想办法告诉他的。
I'll think of something to tell him.


125
00:09:17.676 --> 00:09:19.051
(电话响了)
[phone ringing]


126

(手机嘀嘀声)

127
00:09:37.843 --> 00:09:41.635
[自动语音]Lenka不接电话。如果你想留言的话
[automated voice] Lenka is not answering. If you'd like to leave a message--


128
00:09:42.385 --> 00:09:44.468
CzechConnect让你保持联系。

[彼得]这太奇怪了。

183
00:14:08.676 --> 00:14:10.843
会不会有人黑了CzechConnect?
Could someone have hacked the CzechConnect?


184
00:14:11.385 --> 00:14:14.718
[彼得]嗯，不太可能。我们的系统很安全。
[Peter] Mmm, not likely. Our system is secure.


185

Was it Korean?


187
00:14:20.218 --> 00:14:21.593
[Jakub]为什么是韩语?
[Jakub] Why would it be Korean?


188
00:14:22.635 --> 00:14:25.843
(彼得叹了口气)有迹象表明韩国人正在逼近。
[Peter sighs] There are indications the South Koreans are closing in.


189
00:14:26.718 --> 00:14:28.301
不是韩语。

你有什么建议?

192
00:14:35.593 --> 00:14:37.468
(彼得叹了口气)我会调查的。
[Peter sighs] I'll look into it.

[Peter] But it's out. It was one of the first ones to go out.

雅各布，你为什么不回应?
Jakub, why aren't you responding?


215
00:17:35.635 --> 00:17:39.468

00:21:26.426 --> 00:21:29.093
我不需要心理医生。我…我很好。
I don't need a psychiatrist. I'm… I'm fine.


273
00:21:29.760 --> 00:21:32.885
我不希望你的精神状况影响到这次任务。
I don't want your mental well-being to call this mission into question.


274
00:21:35.385 --> 00:21:36.426
同意了。
Agreed.


275
00:21:38.385 --> 00:21:40.093
你不用担心我。
You don't need to worry about me.


276
00:21:40.176 --> 00:21:41.551
[彼得]这就是我的工作。
[Peter] That is what my job is.


277
00:21:44.051 --> 00:21:47.801
单独相处六个月，你开始想太多了。
Six months apart in isolation, you start thinking too much.


278
00:21:49.635 --> 00:21:53.343
[Jakub]是的，我需要回到那里，彼得。
[Jakub] Yeah, I need to get back out there, Peter.


279
00:21:53.426 --> 00:21:54.426
(彼得)好。
[Peter] Okay.


280
00:21:57.718 --> 00:21:59.218
[蜘蛛]我能感觉到你的恐惧。
[spider] I sense your fear.


281
00:22:04.010 --> 00:22:05.843
但我并不想伤害你。
But I do not mean you any harm.


282
00:22:13.260 --> 00:22:14.676
你不必担心。
You needn't worry.


283
00:22:15.426 --> 00:22:19.510
在与地球清洁剂的接触中，我没有感到任何痛苦。
I experienced no pain in my encounter with Earth's cleaning agents.


284
00:22:20.926 --> 00:22:21.926
只有……
Only…


285
00:22:22.468 --> 00:22:23.760
(打喷嚏)
[sneezes]


286
00:22:24.635 --> 00:22:26.426
(呼吸颤抖)
[breath trembling]


287
00:22:26.510 --> 00:22:27.968
[蜘蛛]对不起。
[spider] My apologies.


288
00:22:30.635 --> 00:22:32.676
你不需要你的保护壳。
You do not need your protective shell.


289
00:22:33.343 --> 00:22:36.260
我既不会消耗你，也不会污染你。
I will neither consume nor contaminate you.


290
00:22:40.385 --> 00:22:43.260
啊。你想知道我是否真实。
Ah. You wish to know if I am real.


291
00:22:44.635 --> 00:22:45.635
是吗?
Are you?


292
00:22:46.760 --> 00:22:49.676
[蜘蛛]我和你一样真实。
[spider] I am as real as you are.


293
00:22:50.676 --> 00:22:51.968
[Jakub]你不可能。
[Jakub] You can't be.


294
00:22:52.051 --> 00:22:53.593
[彼得]那是什么，雅各布?
[Peter] What was that, Jakub?


295
00:22:54.135 --> 00:22:55.551
不不不不不不。
No, no, no, no, no.


296
00:22:56.426 --> 00:22:57.760
彼得，没什么。
Peter, it's nothing.


297
00:23:06.010 --> 00:23:07.926
[蜘蛛]我希望你不要那样做。
[spider] I would prefer you do not do that.


298
00:23:08.426 --> 00:23:12.051
这不是我们部落的习惯。
It is not customary for my tribe.


299
00:23:12.135 --> 00:23:14.843
身体不能被侵犯。
The body must not be violated.


300
00:23:20.093 --> 00:23:22.885
(宇航服嘘声)
[spacesuit hisses]


301
00:23:22.968 --> 00:23:24.885
(呼吸颤抖)
[breath trembling]


302
00:23:42.343 --> 00:23:43.635
你为什么在这里?
Why are you here?


303
00:23:45.176 --> 00:23:48.051
[蜘蛛]我和你一样，是个探险家。
[spider] I am like you, an explorer.


304
00:23:50.760 --> 00:23:53.218
但你为什么在这艘船上?
But why are you on this vessel?


305
00:23:55.010 --> 00:23:57.218
[蜘蛛]我正在你们太阳系的边缘旅行
[spider] I was traveling to the edges of your solar system


306
00:23:57.301 --> 00:24:00.843
当我感受到人类的吸引力时
when I felt the pull of humans.


307
00:24:01.343 --> 00:24:05.385
我从轨道上观测了你们的地球，研究了你们的历史，
I surveyed your Earth from orbit, studied your history,


308
00:24:05.468 --> 00:24:06.843
学习你们的语言。
learned your languages.


309
00:24:06.926 --> 00:24:09.968
然而在获得了你的知识之后，
Yet having accessed your knowledge,


310
00:24:10.051 --> 00:24:12.218
我还是不明白。
I still did not understand.


311
00:24:13.885 --> 00:24:16.260
就在那时我遇到了你的船。
That is when I encountered your ship.


312
00:24:17.343 --> 00:24:22.301
你的孤独引起了我的兴趣。
Your loneliness intrigued me.


313
00:24:24.135 --> 00:24:27.926
我本来打算研究你一两天，但后来我想知道更多。
I intended to study you a day or two, but then I wished to know more.


314
00:24:29.051 --> 00:24:30.593
你强迫我。
You compelled me.


315
00:24:32.968 --> 00:24:37.218
我开始明白我也许能帮上忙。
I've come to understand that I might be of help.


316
00:24:38.260 --> 00:24:40.843
我必须……(颤抖地呼吸)
I have to… [breathes shakily]


317
00:24:47.885 --> 00:24:48.760
(蜘蛛)人吗?
[spider] Human?


318
00:24:53.010 --> 00:24:54.510
瘦小的人吗?
Skinny human?


319
00:25:06.093 --> 00:25:07.593
我不打扰你了。
I will leave you alone.


320
00:25:09.301 --> 00:25:10.926
我这是怎么了?
[Jakub] What's happening to me?


321
00:25:20.510 --> 00:25:22.093
[神秘音乐演奏]
[mystical music playing]


322
00:25:25.510 --> 00:25:27.510
[Lenka]这将是我们的家，Jakub。
[Lenka] This is going to be our home, Jakub.


323
00:25:27.593 --> 00:25:28.718
(喘息)
[gasps]


324
00:25:30.551 --> 00:25:32.385
[播放悬疑音乐]
[suspenseful music playing]


325
00:26:31.926 --> 00:26:34.343
当你爱上一个人，你就注定要截肢
When you love someone, you're meant to amputate


326
00:26:34.426 --> 00:26:37.010
把你的一部分，换成另一个人的一部分。
a piece of what is you and replace it with a piece of the other.


327
00:26:37.885 --> 00:26:39.468
[蜘蛛]不要害怕。
[spider] Do not be afraid.


328
00:26:42.135 --> 00:26:43.218
[Jakub]这是什么?
[Jakub] What is this?


329
00:26:44.301 --> 00:26:46.676
你知道我把自己割了那么多吗
Do you get that I fucking amputated so much of myself


330
00:26:46.760 --> 00:26:48.426
我都不知道自己是谁了?
I don't even know who I am anymore?


331
00:26:48.510 --> 00:26:50.635
-你放弃了吗?-不管。
-What have you given up, huh? -Whatever.


332
00:27:01.968 --> 00:27:03.926
你要这样对我吗?
Are you doing this to me?


333
00:27:04.010 --> 00:27:04.926
(对象卡嗒卡嗒响)
[objects clattering]


334
00:27:05.010 --> 00:27:07.760
我去哪儿你就去哪儿，你去哪儿我就去哪儿。宇航员?
You go where I go, and I go where you go. Right, Spaceman?


335
00:27:09.551 --> 00:27:12.676
[蜘蛛]我想帮助你摆脱精神上的痛苦。
[spider] I wish to assist you in your emotional distress.


336
00:27:13.551 --> 00:27:16.760
你的伴侣似乎在疏远你。
It seems your mate is pulling away.


337
00:27:18.593 --> 00:27:22.301
也许我的出现能减轻你的孤独。
Perhaps my presence can lessen your solitude.


338
00:27:25.551 --> 00:27:26.968
我不需要你的帮助。
I don't need your help.


339
00:27:27.635 --> 00:27:29.093
但你知道。
But you do.


340
00:27:36.343 --> 00:27:38.301
[忧郁的音乐播放]
[melancholy music playing]


341
00:27:57.301 --> 00:28:00.468
在这个国家有一个地方是为单身的孕妇准备的。
There's a place in the country for pregnant women who are alone.


342
00:28:01.343 --> 00:28:03.510
它们住在一起，吃在一起，
They live together, eat together,


343
00:28:04.426 --> 00:28:07.468
在分娩和最初的几周内互相支持。
support each other through the birth and the first few weeks.


344
00:28:07.551 --> 00:28:09.635
我…我不明白。
I… I don't understand.


345
00:28:11.343 --> 00:28:14.635
你宁愿在森林里被陌生人包围吗?
You'd rather be surrounded by strangers in a forest?


346
00:28:14.718 --> 00:28:16.801
我已经取消了在汉堡的演讲
I already canceled my lecture in Hamburg--


347
00:28:16.885 --> 00:28:18.760
请站在我这边。
Be on my side, please.


348
00:28:20.593 --> 00:28:21.593
我是。
I am.


349
00:28:23.885 --> 00:28:25.051
我一直都是。
I always am.


350
00:28:26.801 --> 00:28:30.218
但是，宝贝，现在做重大决定太疯狂了。
But, baby, this is a crazy time to make big decisions.


351
00:28:30.301 --> 00:28:32.260
现在离开他真是太疯狂了。
It's a crazy time to leave him.


352
00:28:33.593 --> 00:28:34.593
我知道。
I know.


353
00:28:36.260 --> 00:28:38.260
我早就该这么做了。
I should have done it a long time ago.


354
00:28:40.135 --> 00:28:41.760
[忧郁的音乐播放]
[melancholy music playing]


355
00:28:46.926 --> 00:28:47.926
(听不清)
[inaudible]


356
00:28:57.843 --> 00:28:59.260
[开门，打开]
[door unlocks, opens]


357
00:28:59.343 --> 00:29:01.051
[蜘蛛]瘦瘦的人?
[spider] Skinny human?


358
00:29:01.135 --> 00:29:03.093
-不!不!-[蜘蛛]我想问问你的伴侣。
-No! No! -[spider] I need to ask about your mate.


359
00:29:03.176 --> 00:29:04.635
这个房间禁止入内。
This room's off limits.


360
00:29:31.218 --> 00:29:32.760
(遥远的转动)
[distant whirring]


361

(呼呼继续)
[whirring continues]


362
00:29:41.801 --> 00:29:43.635
[蜘蛛]有一张你的照片。
[spider] There is a picture of you.


363
00:29:43.718 --> 00:29:46.218
你是你部落的光荣成员?
You are an honored member of your tribe?


364
00:29:47.218 --> 00:29:49.760
这个房间也是禁止进入的。
This room is also off limits.


365
00:29:51.051 --> 00:29:51.926
给我。
Give me those.


366
00:29:55.676 --> 00:29:59.301
你有很多底线，瘦子。
You have many boundaries, skinny human.


367
00:29:59.385 --> 00:30:02.843
也许他们是你孤独的原因。
Perhaps they are the cause of your loneliness.


368
00:30:05.385 --> 00:30:06.426
出去。
Get out.


369
00:30:26.051 --> 00:30:27.218
(叹息)
[sighs]


370
00:30:29.176 --> 00:30:31.051
[蜘蛛]你有卵子吗?
[spider] Do you have any ova?


371
00:30:33.385 --> 00:30:35.218
鸟类的变种。
Of the avian variety.


372
00:30:40.010 --> 00:30:41.885
瘦小的人吗?
Skinny human?


373
00:30:43.176 --> 00:30:44.801
你指的是鸡蛋吗?
Are you referring to eggs?


374
00:30:44.885 --> 00:30:47.510
[蜘蛛]是的，我想试一试。
[spider] Yes, I wish to sample them.


375
00:30:48.135 --> 00:30:50.093
你这样看待他们。
You set them in such regard.


376
00:30:51.760 --> 00:30:55.135
我没有。它们不适合旅行。
I don't have any. They don't travel well.


377
00:30:56.301 --> 00:30:57.260
(蜘蛛)哦。
[spider] Oh.


378
00:31:14.968 --> 00:31:16.593
你想试试这个吗?
Do you want to sample this?


379
00:31:37.510 --> 00:31:38.551
(蜘蛛)嗯。
[spider] Hmm.


380
00:31:46.676 --> 00:31:47.760
嗯。
Mmm.


381
00:31:48.510 --> 00:31:55.385
像家乡的shtoma幼虫一样浓郁柔滑。
Rich and creamy like the shtoma larvae back home.


382
00:31:58.176 --> 00:32:00.843
你的家到底在哪里?
Where is home for you exactly?


383
00:32:02.176 --> 00:32:03.468
[蜘蛛]丢了。
[spider] It is lost.


384
00:32:05.010 --> 00:32:07.510
戈罗姆人来找我们了。
The Gorompeds came for us.


385
00:32:08.801 --> 00:32:11.135
和你一样，我逃离了我的星球。
Just like you, I fled my planet.


386
00:32:11.760 --> 00:32:14.051
穿过星系，穿过黑洞。
Through galaxies, through black holes.


387
00:32:14.135 --> 00:32:19.176
我穿越宇宙，穿越时空，寻找慰藉。
I fled through the universe, through time, looking for solace.


388
00:32:19.801 --> 00:32:21.718
但后来我找到了你。
But then I found you.


389
00:32:28.093 --> 00:32:31.676
这就是你们这种人对待孤独的方式吗?
Is this how your kind treats your feelings of loneliness?


390
00:32:32.676 --> 00:32:34.343
我想这是一种方式。
It's one way I suppose.


391
00:32:36.218 --> 00:32:37.510
[旋翼叶片旋转]
[rotor blades whirring]


392
00:32:39.760 --> 00:32:41.510
[图玛]她知道自己嫁给了谁。
[Tuma] She knew who she married.


393
00:32:42.010 --> 00:32:48.468
所有这些品质都让他有能力独自在太空中度过一年
All the qualities that make him capable of spending a year alone in space


394
00:32:48.551 --> 00:32:49.676
这让他…
makes him, uh…


395
00:32:51.010 --> 00:32:51.843
特有的。
peculiar.


396
00:32:55.718 --> 00:32:57.218
她会跟你说话吗?
[woman] Will she even talk to you?


397
00:33:00.260 --> 00:33:02.843
她怀孕了，很孤独。
She's very pregnant and very alone.


398
00:33:04.135 --> 00:33:06.051
当你一个人的时候，你会想。
And when you're alone, you think.


399
00:33:09.010 --> 00:33:11.260
她想得太多了。
She's had too much time to think.


400
00:33:23.051 --> 00:33:24.760
[蜘蛛]我们有工作要做。
[spider] We have work to do.


401
00:33:26.676 --> 00:33:28.260
你有时间吗?
[Lenka] You have time for this?


402
00:33:31.551 --> 00:33:33.551
我还以为你会盯着天上的云呢。
Thought you'd be staring up at your cloud.


403
00:33:33.635 --> 00:33:34.718
(彼得)Jakub。
[Peter] Jakub.


404
00:33:37.343 --> 00:33:38.385
Jakub。
Jakub.


405
00:33:39.843 --> 00:33:41.093
怎么啦？
What?


406
00:33:41.176 --> 00:33:44.176
Peter:我们发现Lenka的CzechConnect存在一些问题。
[Peter] We've identified some issues with Lenka's CzechConnect.


407
00:33:46.926 --> 00:33:48.260
——(Jakub)好。——(蜘蛛)。
-[Jakub] Okay. -[spider] Come.


408
00:33:49.718 --> 00:33:51.135
[Jakub]什么时候修好?
[Jakub] When is it fixed?


409
00:33:51.218 --> 00:33:52.885
[彼得]我们的工程师正在处理。
[Peter] Our engineers are on it.


410
00:33:54.926 --> 00:33:57.676
是吗?谢谢你！
Yeah? Thank you.


411
00:33:57.760 --> 00:33:59.926
听着，彼得，我得回去了。
Look, Peter, I got to get back to it.


412
00:34:01.135 --> 00:34:02.301
[彼得]你去吧。
[Peter] You do that.


413
00:34:19.510 --> 00:34:20.760
[Jakub]这云……
[Jakub] This cloud…


414
00:34:21.926 --> 00:34:23.676
你也觉得很美吗?
it's beautiful to you too?


415
00:34:24.468 --> 00:34:28.010
它有很多智慧，瘦骨嶙峋的人。
[spider] It holds much wisdom, skinny human.


416
00:34:29.635 --> 00:34:33.051
我小的时候，舌头上沾过它的颗粒。
When I was young, I caught its grains on my tongue.


417
00:34:34.218 --> 00:34:36.718
它们来自太初。
They are from the Beginning.


418
00:34:37.510 --> 00:34:39.010
这些粒子……
These particles…


419
00:34:41.093 --> 00:34:43.468
它们来自宇宙的起源?
They are from the origin of the universe?


420
00:34:44.426 --> 00:34:46.510
这就是乔普拉吗?
Is that what Chopra is?


421
00:34:47.510 --> 00:34:48.635
(蜘蛛)。
[spider] Perhaps.


422
00:34:49.968 --> 00:34:51.468
你当时也在场?
And you were there?


423
00:34:54.385 --> 00:34:55.718
你多大了?
How old are you?


424
00:34:57.926 --> 00:34:59.510
你们这种人不会死吗?
Do your kind not die?


425
00:35:00.260 --> 00:35:03.718
[蜘蛛]有始必有终，瘦弱的人。
[spider] Everything that begins must end, skinny human.


426
00:35:04.635 --> 00:35:06.593
甚至宇宙本身。
Even the universe itself.


427
00:35:09.885 --> 00:35:11.426
它在把我们拉进去。
It's pulling us in.


428
00:35:12.635 --> 00:35:14.385
里面有东西吗?
Is there something inside?


429
00:35:15.468 --> 00:35:16.468
(蜘蛛)是的。
[spider] Yes.


430
00:35:18.176 --> 00:35:19.426
[Jakub]这是什么?
[Jakub] What is it?


431
00:35:21.135 --> 00:35:22.385
[蜘蛛]《开始》。
[spider] The Beginning.


432
00:35:24.176 --> 00:35:25.343
一个开始。
The Beginning.


433
00:35:28.510 --> 00:35:29.676
这是什么?
What is this?


434
00:35:38.885 --> 00:35:40.635
我有个提议。
I have a proposition for you.


435
00:35:42.051 --> 00:35:43.301
我去哪儿你就去哪儿。
You go where I go.


436
00:35:44.051 --> 00:35:45.676
你去哪儿我就去哪儿。
And I go where you go.


437
00:35:45.760 --> 00:35:46.801
交易吗?
Deal?


438
00:35:47.843 --> 00:35:48.968
-是的。- - - - - -[笑]
-Yeah. -[chuckles]


439
00:35:50.760 --> 00:35:53.760
-[Jakub]你要带我去哪里?-[Lenka笑]相信我!
-[Jakub] Where are you taking me? -[Lenka chuckles] Trust me!


440
00:35:55.760 --> 00:35:57.510
[Jakub]好吧，你去哪儿我就去哪儿。
[Jakub] Okay, I'll go where you go.


441
00:35:58.551 --> 00:36:00.135
[蜘蛛]我不明白。
[spider] I don't understand.


442
00:36:00.843 --> 00:36:04.135
如果一个承诺很容易被打破，为什么还要信守它呢?
Why commit to a promise if it can readily be broken?


443
00:36:04.885 --> 00:36:07.968
这样的承诺有什么目的呢?
What purpose does such a commitment serve?


444
00:36:08.051 --> 00:36:09.968
这些想法是你自己产生的吗?
Are you creating these thoughts?


445
00:36:10.801 --> 00:36:11.801
(蜘蛛)。
[spider] No.


446
00:36:13.426 --> 00:36:15.260
这些是你的想法。
These are your thoughts.


447
00:36:17.260 --> 00:36:19.968
我只是和你一起寻找它们。
I am simply finding them with you.


448
00:36:20.051 --> 00:36:21.510
不,不。
No, no.


449
00:36:23.093 --> 00:36:24.468
我不会允许的。
I'm not allowing that.


450
00:36:26.593 --> 00:36:28.051
停下你正在做的事。
Stop what you're doing.


451
00:36:29.218 --> 00:36:31.468
[蜘蛛]你为什么抗拒这种探索?
[spider] Why do you resist this exploration?


452
00:36:33.093 --> 00:36:34.426
让我来帮你。
Let me help you.


453
00:36:35.551 --> 00:36:36.885
我不喜欢水。
I don't love water.


454
00:36:38.385 --> 00:36:40.676
我是救生员。我可以当救生员。
I'm a lifeguard. I could be a lifeguard.


455
00:36:42.176 --> 00:36:43.676
我会救你的。
I will save you.


456
00:36:43.760 --> 00:36:47.635
[蜘蛛]只有当你的伴侣离开时，你才会渴望她。
[spider] You long for your mate only once she leaves.


457
00:36:47.718 --> 00:36:49.135
随便你。
Suit yourself.


458
00:36:49.718 --> 00:36:50.551
(蜘蛛)为什么?
[spider] Why?


459
00:36:52.468 --> 00:36:54.926
你们在一起时的思念在哪里?
Where was this yearning when you were together?


460
00:36:58.801 --> 00:37:00.760
我不知道该怎么回答你。
I don't have any answers for you.


461
00:37:13.968 --> 00:37:17.093
[蜘蛛]这与你的伦卡的冲突，
[spider] This strife with your Lenka,


462
00:37:18.301 --> 00:37:20.968
它在我心中激起了某种我不认识的东西。
it stirs something in me I do not recognize.


463
00:37:22.760 --> 00:37:24.843
你的回忆让我…
Your memories are making me…


464
00:37:26.635 --> 00:37:27.760
沮丧?
depressed?


465
00:37:30.218 --> 00:37:32.218
但是用榛子做的酱
But the spread made of hazelnut


466
00:37:32.301 --> 00:37:35.218
让我的意识没那么不愉快了。
did make my realization seem less unpleasant.


467
00:37:38.676 --> 00:37:41.218
也许我们得留点以后再用。
Maybe we need to save some for later then.


468
00:37:56.926 --> 00:37:59.301
有没有觉得你可能会蒸发?
Ever felt like you might evaporate?


469
00:38:04.343 --> 00:38:05.551
这就是我的感受。
That's how I felt.


470
00:38:09.385 --> 00:38:10.551
我有希望。
And I have hope.


471
00:38:15.010 --> 00:38:16.343
很快就会好起来的。
It'll get better soon.


472
00:38:20.135 --> 00:38:22.593
我来收拾。我不会蒸发。
I'll get it together. I'm not going to evaporate.


473
00:38:26.218 --> 00:38:27.301
只是……
It's just that…


474
00:38:28.968 --> 00:38:30.343
他看不见我。
he can't see me.


475
00:38:33.010 --> 00:38:35.218
不是真的。下面的世界……
Not really. The world down here…


476
00:38:37.343 --> 00:38:39.551
我们只是点。(抽泣)
We're just dots. [sniffles]


477
00:38:44.968 --> 00:38:46.260
你不是一个点。
You're not a dot.


478
00:38:46.760 --> 00:38:47.593
[伦卡]我知道。
[Lenka] I know.


479
00:38:49.051 --> 00:38:50.468
这就是我想出来的。
That's what I worked out.


480
00:38:52.135 --> 00:38:53.385
我确实存在。
I do exist.


481
00:38:57.343 --> 00:38:59.426
独自抚养一个孩子是很困难的。
Raising a kid alone is hard.


482
00:39:03.010 --> 00:39:04.510
(小鸟喳喳叫)
[birds chirping]


483
00:39:08.135 --> 00:39:10.135
[Lenka深深地叹了口气]
[Lenka sighs deeply]


484
00:39:12.301 --> 00:39:15.176
你想过要怎么跟孩子说吗?
Have you thought about what you're going to tell the baby?


485
00:39:17.843 --> 00:39:19.635
我会告诉我们的女儿真相。
I'll tell our daughter the truth.


486
00:39:23.551 --> 00:39:25.260
当我嫁给她父亲时……
When I married her father…


487
00:39:27.218 --> 00:39:28.176
我爱他。
I loved him.


488
00:39:31.510 --> 00:39:33.760
我喜欢他的雄心壮志。
I loved that he was ambitious.


489
00:39:40.551 --> 00:39:41.760
我错了。
I was wrong.


490
00:39:45.301 --> 00:39:47.301
年轻人总是错的。
Young people are wrong all the time.


491
00:39:48.718 --> 00:39:51.051
人们总是错的。
People are wrong all the time.


492
00:39:52.676 --> 00:39:53.718
(Lenka叹了口气)
[Lenka sighs]


493
00:40:10.260 --> 00:40:11.468
你有名字吗?
Do you have a name?


494
00:40:12.801 --> 00:40:14.385
我该怎么称呼你?
What am I supposed to call you?


495
00:40:15.093 --> 00:40:17.468
[蜘蛛]我从来没有名字。
[spider] I have never had a name.


496
00:40:18.385 --> 00:40:20.801
你能给我一个吗?
Would it help you to give me one?


497
00:40:20.885 --> 00:40:22.176
它会。
It would.


498
00:40:22.885 --> 00:40:24.718
[蜘蛛]那说出我的名字。
[spider] Then name me.


499
00:40:25.551 --> 00:40:27.968
你能想到一个适合我的吗?
Can you think of one that becomes me?


500
00:40:31.843 --> 00:40:32.968
哈努斯呢?
How about Hanuš?


501
00:40:33.926 --> 00:40:35.551
(蜘蛛)Hanuš……
[spider] Hanuš…


502
00:40:37.218 --> 00:40:39.051
[Jakub]我父亲跟我说过他。
[Jakub] My father told me about him.


503
00:40:40.635 --> 00:40:43.426
他在布拉格建造了天文钟。
He built the astronomical clock in Prague.


504
00:40:44.593 --> 00:40:48.343
它测量恒星和行星的运动。
It measured the movements of the stars and the planets.


505
00:40:48.426 --> 00:40:50.551
这是世界上绝无仅有的。
It was like nothing else in the world.


506
00:40:50.635 --> 00:40:52.968
[蜘蛛]你的哈努什怎么了?
[spider] What happened to your Hanuš?


507
00:40:53.593 --> 00:40:55.885
有个国王把他的眼睛戳出来了。
Some king poked his eyes out.


508
00:40:57.218 --> 00:41:00.885
我想是嫉妒吧。这威胁到了他的遗产。
Jealousy, I believe. It threatened his legacy.


509
00:41:02.093 --> 00:41:03.176
(蜘蛛)好奇。
[spider] Curious.


510
00:41:04.301 --> 00:41:06.343
计时机呢?
And the timekeeping machine?


511
00:41:06.426 --> 00:41:07.718
现在起作用了。
It works now.


512
00:41:09.426 --> 00:41:12.051
但我不确定这是否是哈努斯建造的……
But I'm not sure if Hanuš built it…


513
00:41:13.135 --> 00:41:15.093
或者如果别人做了……
or if someone else did…


514
00:41:16.926 --> 00:41:19.385
或者哈努斯是否存在
or if Hanuš even exists.


515
00:41:22.218 --> 00:41:24.468
我将被称为哈努斯。
I will be called Hanuš.


516
00:41:26.926 --> 00:41:27.968
好。
Good.


517
00:41:29.051 --> 00:41:30.260
Hanuš。
Hanuš.


518
00:41:32.926 --> 00:41:34.885
[通过扬声器播放歌剧音乐]
[operatic music playing over speakers]


519
00:41:36.843 --> 00:41:38.093
(呼呼)
[whirring]


520
00:41:56.468 --> 00:41:57.801
[音乐音量增大]
[music volume increases]


521
00:42:04.843 --> 00:42:06.176
(转动停止)
[whirring stops]


522
00:42:09.093 --> 00:42:12.260
[哈努什]这是一部悲剧?
[Hanuš] This is a tragic opera?


523
00:42:13.301 --> 00:42:14.468
是关于什么的?
What is it about?


524
00:42:15.135 --> 00:42:16.843
[Jakub]我是Rusalka。
[Jakub] This is Rusalka.


525
00:42:17.551 --> 00:42:20.718
爱上凡人的水仙。
A water nymph who falls in love with a mortal man.


526
00:42:21.676 --> 00:42:23.093
但他们不能在一起。
But they can't be together.


527
00:42:23.885 --> 00:42:27.135
哈努什:你在这对不幸的恋人身上看到了自己。
[Hanuš] You see yourself in the star-crossed lovers.


528
00:42:30.135 --> 00:42:31.260
[Lenka]别害怕。
[Lenka] Don't be scared.


529
00:42:32.426 --> 00:42:35.135
[Jakub]我是一名正在训练的宇航员。我从不害怕。
[Jakub] I'm a cosmonaut in training. I'm never scared.


530
00:42:36.551 --> 00:42:38.801
[Lenka]你一直想当宇航员吗?
[Lenka] Did you always want to be a cosmonaut?


531
00:42:39.635 --> 00:42:41.843
[Jakub]嗯，我应该养猪的。
[Jakub] Well, I was supposed to raise pigs.


532
00:42:42.635 --> 00:42:43.885
(Lenka)真的吗?
[Lenka] Really?


533
00:42:45.510 --> 00:42:48.426
但父亲去世后，我的梦想变得更大了。
But after my father died, my dreams got bigger.


534
00:42:50.718 --> 00:42:52.093
我父亲也死了。
My father's dead too.


535
00:42:55.468 --> 00:42:56.843
你要带我去哪里?
[Jakub] Where are you taking me?


536
00:42:57.843 --> 00:43:00.885
[Lenka]我想你可能想看些东西。
[Lenka] I thought you might want to see something.


537
00:43:01.468 --> 00:43:02.635
这是什么?
What is this?


538
00:43:03.385 --> 00:43:05.135
这是一个秘密的地方。
It's a secret place.


539
00:43:06.260 --> 00:43:08.968
[哈努斯]有太多的爱。
[Hanuš] There was so much love.


540
00:43:10.426 --> 00:43:11.718
它去哪儿了?
Where did it go?


541
00:43:12.301 --> 00:43:14.801
请不要再这样对我了。
Please stop doing this to me.


542
00:43:14.885 --> 00:43:18.301
我们必须坚持下去，瘦骨嶙峋的人。
[Hanuš] We must persist, skinny human.


543
00:43:46.760 --> 00:43:47.760
(尖叫)
[squeals]


544
00:43:47.843 --> 00:43:49.426
(喘息)
[gasps]


545
00:43:51.385 --> 00:43:53.593
(猪反常的)
[pigs squealing]


546
00:43:53.676 --> 00:43:57.426
(古斯塔夫·胡萨克，捷克语)同胞们，亲爱的同志们。
[Gustav Husak, in Czech] Fellow citizens, dear comrades.


547
00:43:58.051 --> 00:44:03.218
人民不再相信共产党的统治。
The people no longer trust in the rule of the Communist Party.


548
00:44:03.301 --> 00:44:09.135
今天，我向你们发表讲话，以确保我们能够避免一个无法无天的国家。
Today, I speak to you to ensure we can avoid a lawless state.


549
00:44:09.843 --> 00:44:15.926
我将辞去我作为捷克斯洛伐克社会主义共和国总统的职务。
I will abdicate my role as the president of the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic.


550
00:44:17.176 --> 00:44:22.135
我希望我们的国家和人民民主发展成功。
I hope for a successful democratic development of our state and its people.


551
00:44:25.801 --> 00:44:27.635
(机器转动)
[machine whirring]


552
00:44:44.218 --> 00:44:45.760
(转动停止)
[whirring stops]


553
00:44:49.260 --> 00:44:52.343
你整晚都在这儿听那个吗?
[in English] Were you just here listening to that all night?


554
00:44:52.426 --> 00:44:54.593
我觉得振动很舒缓。
I find the vibrations soothing.


555
00:44:55.426 --> 00:44:57.885
起初，我和你一起进入你的思想。
At first, I entered your thoughts with you.


556
00:44:57.968 --> 00:45:00.593
但我觉得不舒服。
But I felt uncomfortable.


557
00:45:01.135 --> 00:45:03.635
你们这种人背负着巨大的罪恶感。
Your kind carries a great deal of guilt.


558
00:45:04.343 --> 00:45:05.676
你的不?
Yours doesn't?


559
00:45:05.760 --> 00:45:07.885
不。我们为什么要这么做?
No. Why should we?


560
00:45:08.635 --> 00:45:11.260
宇宙就是它应该有的样子。
The universe is as it should be.


561
00:45:13.968 --> 00:45:17.176
我要解除你对这个房间的禁令，哈努斯。
I am removing your ban on this room, Hanuš.


562
00:45:18.468 --> 00:45:19.718
为了舒缓的目的。
For soothing purposes.


563
00:45:23.135 --> 00:45:25.510
(跑步机转动)
[treadmill whirring]


564
00:45:31.051 --> 00:45:33.593
[哈努斯]这有什么目的?
[Hanuš] What purpose does this serve?


565
00:45:33.676 --> 00:45:37.301
我每天必须做两个小时，以防止我的骨头腐烂。
I have to do this two hours a day to keep my bones from decaying.


566
00:45:41.468 --> 00:45:44.260
你选择逃离你的星球，
[Hanuš] You chose to flee your planet,


567
00:45:44.343 --> 00:45:46.551
但这种行为对你是有害的。
yet that act is destructive to you.


568
00:45:50.468 --> 00:45:53.176
你的父亲。我可以问一下他的情况吗?
Your father. May I ask about him?


569
00:45:53.260 --> 00:45:56.260
(猪反常的)
[pigs squealing]


570
00:45:59.801 --> 00:46:00.843
他怎么样了?
What about him?


571
00:46:01.468 --> 00:46:03.176
[哈努斯]他怎么了?
[Hanuš] What happened to him?


572
00:46:06.676 --> 00:46:09.260
他因为相信真相而被杀。
He was killed for what he believed was the truth.


573
00:46:10.010 --> 00:46:12.010
[哈努斯]你父亲是烈士?
[Hanuš] Your father was a martyr?


574
00:46:12.593 --> 00:46:14.885
他站在了历史错误的一边。
He was on the wrong side of history.


575
00:46:14.968 --> 00:46:15.926
爸爸!
Papa!


576
00:46:16.010 --> 00:46:18.635
[Jakub]我爸爸是个好人，但也做过坏事。
[Jakub] My dad was a good man who did bad things.


577
00:46:19.468 --> 00:46:21.510
他是党的线人。
He was an informant for the Party.


578
00:46:23.593 --> 00:46:27.968
你相信这个伟大的使命能弥补你父亲的罪过。
You believe this great mission will atone for the sins of your father.


579
00:46:30.218 --> 00:46:33.718
你应该多关注那些瘦骨嶙峋的活人。
You should focus more on the living, skinny human.


580
00:46:34.593 --> 00:46:37.635
现在该轮到你做父亲了。
It's your turn to be a father now.


581
00:46:46.385 --> 00:46:47.218
[敲门]
[knock at door]


582
00:47:00.843 --> 00:47:04.051
宝贝，有人来找你。
[softly] Baby, someone's here to see you.


583
00:47:10.343 --> 00:47:12.301
[图玛]你想离开你丈夫?
[Tuma] You want to leave your husband?


584
00:47:16.260 --> 00:47:17.760
我已经离开他了。
I have left him.


585
00:47:17.843 --> 00:47:21.051
[图玛]不，你给他留了言。
[Tuma] No, you left him a message.


586
00:47:21.760 --> 00:47:24.635
但问题是我还没给他。
But the thing is I haven't given it to him.


587
00:47:27.301 --> 00:47:28.468
当然可以。
Of course.


588
00:47:29.135 --> 00:47:31.593
我的工作是保护他。
My job is to protect him.


589
00:47:32.968 --> 00:47:35.468
我是在保护他孩子的母亲。
I'm trying to protect the mother of his child.


590
00:47:37.760 --> 00:47:39.301
你的任务很安全。
Your mission is safe.


591
00:47:39.385 --> 00:47:41.426
我向你保证雅各布不会有事的。
I assure you Jakub will be fine.


592
00:47:42.343 --> 00:47:44.010
他自己很好。
He's good on his own.


593
00:47:45.051 --> 00:47:47.260
我敢肯定他很难相处。
I'm sure that he's hard to live with.


594
00:47:48.801 --> 00:47:50.051
但是他做得不好。
But he's not doing well.


595
00:47:52.510 --> 00:47:54.718
"他做得不好"是什么意思?
What does that mean, "he's not doing well"?


596
00:47:56.135 --> 00:47:57.551
他想念他的妻子。
[Tuma] He misses his wife.


597
00:47:59.676 --> 00:48:01.176
那他就不该走。
Then he shouldn't have left.


598
00:48:04.718 --> 00:48:06.551
我不会给他留言的。
I'm not giving him your message.


599
00:48:07.093 --> 00:48:08.093
(椅子擦伤)
[chair scrapes]


600
00:48:09.635 --> 00:48:14.510
现在有人在你家里禁用CzechConnect。
[Tuma] There are people now at your home disabling the CzechConnect.


601
00:48:16.093 --> 00:48:18.676
如果你不保护雅各布，那我来。
If you won't protect Jakub, I will.


602
00:48:20.218 --> 00:48:22.801
现在，他需要相信
Right now, he needs to believe


603
00:48:22.885 --> 00:48:25.135
你们俩仍然是一个爱情故事。
that the two of you are still a love story.


604
00:48:25.218 --> 00:48:26.468
[Lenka]我不确定他知道。
[Lenka] I'm not sure he does.


605
00:48:29.843 --> 00:48:33.218
当你丈夫身处危险境地时，你不会离开他的。
You don't leave your husband when he's in a dangerous place.


606
00:48:33.301 --> 00:48:34.885
不是我让他去的。
I didn't put him there.


607
00:48:36.968 --> 00:48:39.218
你为什么不能等他回来呢?
Why can't you wait until he comes back?


608
00:48:40.510 --> 00:48:43.093
(深深地吸了口气)对不起。我帮不了你。
[inhales deeply] I'm sorry. I can't help you.


609
00:48:51.093 --> 00:48:55.385
你知道吗，伦卡，保持沉默才是关键。
You know, Lenka, the silence is the point.


610
00:48:57.926 --> 00:48:58.885
怎么啦？
What?


611
00:48:59.926 --> 00:49:03.093
“我们都上了CzechConnect，但却一片沉默，
"We're both on CzechConnect and there is silence,


612
00:49:03.176 --> 00:49:04.426
那有什么意义呢?”
so what is the point?"


613
00:49:05.718 --> 00:49:07.760
沉默才是关键。
The silence is the point.


614
00:49:09.218 --> 00:49:12.051
你们两个在一起
The two of you together,


615
00:49:12.135 --> 00:49:15.968
沉默，迷失，恐惧，在黑暗中，

616
00:49:16.593 --> 00:49:17.676
持有。

617
00:49:19.093 --> 00:49:20.676
这就是问题的关键。
That is the point.


618
00:49:33.343 --> 00:49:34.718
[Jakub]速度为零。

619
00:49:35.385 --> 00:49:37.010
[彼得]确认SSR。
[Peter] Confirm SSR.

[Jakub] SSR到达目标。旋转，12度。FSC订婚。
[Jakub] SSR on target. Rotation, 12 degrees. FSC engaged.

接触。完成了。

[Peter] FERDA Collection Simulation, Scenario Beta 3-3 concluded.


623
00:49:54.760 --> 00:49:56.510
太好了,指挥官。这是完美的。
Great, Commander. That's perfect.


624
00:49:57.801 --> 00:50:00.135
在这里待了六个月。我知道，彼得。
Six months in here. I know this, Peter.


625
00:50:00.801 --> 00:50:03.635
[彼得]我知道，但还有45个小时呢。
[Peter] I know, but 45 hours to go.


626
00:50:04.635 --> 00:50:06.010
你会先到的。
And you'll be there first.


627
00:50:07.343 --> 00:50:09.051
我们为你感到骄傲。
We're very proud of you down here.


628
00:50:09.760 --> 00:50:10.760
(Jakub)是的。
[Jakub] Yeah.


629
00:50:17.885 --> 00:50:18.843

[Lenka] Hello?


630

从地球到Jakub?

631
00:50:21.551 --> 00:50:25.718
你能停下来吗?我真的没有时间。
[Jakub] Will you stop? I really don't have time.


632
00:50:26.385 --> 00:50:28.135
[哈努斯]这不是我造成的。
[Hanuš] I am not the cause of this.


633
00:50:30.260 --> 00:50:31.385
[Lenka]你在吗?
[Lenka] Are you there?


634
00:50:34.218 --> 00:50:35.593
(通过扬声器)对不起。
[Jakub over speakers] I'm sorry.


635
00:50:36.843 --> 00:50:39.801
我只是又累又孤单。
I'm just tired and lonely.


636
00:50:40.510 --> 00:50:41.593
[伦卡]我能理解。
[Lenka] I can relate.


637
00:50:42.676 --> 00:50:43.676
[Jakub]我知道。

638
00:50:45.093 --> 00:50:47.051
也许你可以跟我谈谈。
Maybe you could just talk to me.


639
00:50:48.843 --> 00:50:50.510
[Jakub]你想谈什么?
[Jakub] What do you want to talk about?


640
00:50:51.718 --> 00:50:52.676
[Lenka]。
[Lenka] Anything.


641
00:50:52.760 --> 00:50:54.051
[哈努斯]这是什么?
[Hanuš] What is this?


642
00:50:54.593 --> 00:50:56.093
你应该告诉我一个秘密。
You should tell me a secret.


643
00:50:56.801 --> 00:50:57.718
[Jakub] Lenka，请接。
[Jakub] Lenka, please.


644
00:50:58.551 --> 00:51:01.385
这是几个月前的老话题了。
This is an old conversation from months ago.


645
00:51:01.468 --> 00:51:02.468
[Lenka]记得当你……
[Lenka] Remember when you…


646
00:51:03.635 --> 00:51:06.551
终于告诉我你小时候发生了什么事了吗?
finally told me what happened to you when you were a boy?


647
00:51:07.260 --> 00:51:08.426
[Jakub]怎么了?
[Jakub] What about it?


648
00:51:09.968 --> 00:51:13.760
他们怎么因为你爸爸把你扔进河里?
[Lenka] How they threw you in the river because of your dad?


649
00:51:15.760 --> 00:51:18.135
[Jakub]我还是不想谈论这件事。
[Jakub] And I still don't want to talk about it.


650
00:51:19.343 --> 00:51:21.968
我只是想搞清楚你是谁，雅各布。
I'm just trying to make sense of who you are, Jakub.


651
00:51:22.051 --> 00:51:23.926
[Jakub]这是怎么玩的?
[Jakub] How is this even playing?


652
00:51:24.010 --> 00:51:26.135
你认定我是谁了?
[Jakub over speakers] Who have you decided I am?


653
00:51:26.676 --> 00:51:30.093
我只知道你是一个说你想回家的人
All I know is that you're someone who says that you want to come home


654
00:51:30.885 --> 00:51:34.093
然后说他们想看看木星之外是什么。
and then says they want to see what's beyond Jupiter.


655
00:51:34.593 --> 00:51:36.301
我不能做梦吗?
[Jakub] Am I not allowed to dream?


656
00:51:37.176 --> 00:51:38.385
他妈的!
Fuck!


657
00:51:38.968 --> 00:51:42.718
当你做梦，你离开。
When you dream, you leave.


658
00:51:43.510 --> 00:51:44.510
(Jakub)等等。
[Jakub] Whatever.


659
00:51:46.176 --> 00:51:48.968
(开始震动)
[whirs]


660
00:51:56.260 --> 00:51:57.593
[Jakub]哈努斯，那是
[Jakub] Hanuš, is that--


661
00:51:57.676 --> 00:52:00.301
[哈努斯]一种来自起初的谷物!
[Hanuš] A grain from the Beginning!


662
00:52:01.343 --> 00:52:02.676
Chopra !
It's Chopra!


663
00:52:02.760 --> 00:52:03.676

00:52:39.176 --> 00:52:40.301
(颤音减少)

666
00:52:40.385 --> 00:52:41.926
难以置信!
Unbelievable!


667
00:52:42.426 --> 00:52:43.343
是的!
Yes!


668
00:52:43.426 --> 00:52:44.635
(喘着粗气)
[breathing heavily]


669
00:52:45.968 --> 00:52:47.343
(颤音加剧)
[warbling intensifies]


670
00:52:47.426 --> 00:52:51.010
哈努什:拿不住，瘦骨嶙峋的人。
[Hanuš] It cannot be held, skinny human.


671
00:52:54.676 --> 00:52:56.135
不!不!
No! No!


672
00:52:58.010 --> 00:53:00.468
[紧张的音乐播放]
[tense music playing]


673
00:53:15.218 --> 00:53:18.010
(机器转动)
[machine whirring]


674
00:53:25.718 --> 00:53:27.135
(很好的)
[rattling]


675

(巨大的)
[thumping]


676
00:53:33.218 --> 00:53:34.926
[哈努斯]你让我的电视静音了。
[Hanuš] You have silenced my tube.


677
00:53:44.260 --> 00:53:47.385
你那可耻的浪费不能满足你所寻求的。
Your shameful waste will not hold what you are looking for.

彼得，我觉得我们有麻烦了。
Peter, I think we have an issue here.


681
00:54:08.385 --> 00:54:09.385
彼得?
Peter?


682
00:54:14.801 --> 00:54:16.135
彼得，搞什么鬼?
Peter, what the fuck?


683

[不祥的音乐播放]

[Jakub]控制?
[Jakub] Control?


688
00:55:19.926 --> 00:55:22.176
彼得，你读书吗?

哈努斯，你看到了吗?
Hanuš, do you see that?


691
00:55:47.593 --> 00:55:50.010
[哈努斯]开端临近了。
[Hanuš] The Beginning approaches.


692
00:55:53.801 --> 00:55:55.218
我应该担心吗?
Should I be concerned?


693
00:55:56.385 --> 00:55:58.968
你没什么好怕的，瘦骨嶙峋的人类。
You have nothing to fear, skinny human.


694
00:56:00.135 --> 00:56:02.676
开端不会造成任何伤害。
The Beginning will not cause any harm.


695
00:56:03.801 --> 00:56:06.551
它仅仅是一个存储库。
It is merely a repository.


696
00:56:09.968 --> 00:56:10.885
的什么?
Of what?


697
00:56:11.760 --> 00:56:15.593
[哈努斯]你们部落的语言无法描述这一切。
[Hanuš] The words of your tribe cannot describe this.


698
00:56:16.843 --> 00:56:19.510
也许我们会经历……
Perhaps we will experience it…


699
00:56:21.218 --> 00:56:22.218
在一起。

控制中心，收到吗?
Control, do you read?


703
00:57:12.468 --> 00:57:13.843
[哈努斯]瘦削的人。
[Hanuš] Skinny human.


704
00:57:16.093 --> 00:57:19.093
我必须问一件可能让你不高兴的事。
I must ask something that may upset you.


705
00:57:20.301 --> 00:57:21.385
怎么啦？
What?


706
00:57:21.926 --> 00:57:24.885
你的后代即将到来，
The upcoming arrival of your offspring,


707
00:57:25.968 --> 00:57:28.760
为什么会让你的兰卡如此苦恼?
why should it cause your Lenka such distress?


708
00:57:29.260 --> 00:57:30.635
它不是。
It doesn't.


709
00:57:30.718 --> 00:57:34.885
[哈努斯]然而她的感觉是一种恐惧。
[Hanuš] Yet the flavor of her feelings is one of dread.


710
00:57:34.968 --> 00:57:38.551
你们再次交配产生了这个后代。
You mated again to create this offspring.


711
00:57:38.635 --> 00:57:41.093
你说起这个孩子时很兴奋。
You speak of this offspring with excitement.


712
00:57:41.176 --> 00:57:43.801
我们经历过可怕的事情。
We've experienced things to fear.


713
00:57:43.885 --> 00:57:46.051
[哈努斯]给我看看，瘦骨嶙峋的人。
[Hanuš] Show me, skinny human.


714
00:57:47.343 --> 00:57:48.593
我不在场。
I wasn't there.


715
00:57:50.551 --> 00:57:52.218
(呼呼)

[紧张的音乐播放]
[tense music playing]


717
00:58:19.968 --> 00:58:23.426
哈努斯，我怎么能看出来?
Hanuš, how can I even see this?


718
00:58:24.551 --> 00:58:26.301
-[Lenka呻吟]-[Jakub]我不在那里。
-[Lenka groaning] -[Jakub] I wasn't there.


719
00:58:28.051 --> 00:58:30.385
[哈努斯]你的思想一直在那里，不是吗?
[Hanuš] Your thoughts have been there, haven't they?


720
00:58:30.468 --> 00:58:31.301
(Lenka哭)
[Lenka crying]


721
00:58:31.385 --> 00:58:33.760
[哈努斯]你向他描述过这个事件吗?
[Hanuš] You had the event described to you?


722
00:58:33.843 --> 00:58:37.093
(歇斯底里地哭)
[crying hysterically]


723
00:58:40.135 --> 00:58:41.760
我只想让你回家。
I just want you to come home.


724
00:58:42.385 --> 00:58:43.926
但你知道我做不到。
But you know I can't do that.


725
00:58:44.010 --> 00:58:45.385
[Lenka]我打赌你可以。
[Lenka] I bet you could.


726
00:58:46.593 --> 00:58:49.926
[Jakub] Lenka, Cerný博士说什么?
[Jakub] Lenka, what is Dr. Cerný saying?


727
00:58:50.885 --> 00:58:54.760
[哈努斯]当你的伴侣失去第一个孩子时，你不在。
[Hanuš] You were absent when your mate lost your first offspring.


728
00:58:56.135 --> 00:58:58.468
从那以后你就缺席了。
You were absent thereafter.


729
00:59:00.301 --> 00:59:02.135
那伤透了我的灵魂。
That broke my soul.


730
00:59:03.551 --> 00:59:05.510
我只是觉得很孤单，雅各布。
I just feel so alone, Jakub.


731
00:59:05.593 --> 00:59:07.176
[Jakub]哦，该死!狗屎!
[Jakub] Oh shit! Shit!


732
00:59:08.551 --> 00:59:10.051
我有紧急情况。
I'm having an emergency.


733
00:59:10.135 --> 00:59:11.426
我再打给你。
Let me call you back.


734
00:59:12.176 --> 00:59:13.260
[伦卡]你去吧。
[Lenka] You do that.


735
00:59:13.843 --> 00:59:15.093
CzechConnect让我们保持联系
CzechConnect keeps us connect--


736
00:59:20.760 --> 00:59:24.510
她和你的孩子在一起，而你不在那里。
[Hanuš] Again, she is with your child, and you are not there.


737
00:59:26.801 --> 00:59:27.885
对什么?
What for?


738
00:59:29.135 --> 00:59:34.676
它带来的痛苦，对你有价值吗?
The pain that it causes, it is of value to you?


739

[忧郁的音乐播放]
[melancholy music playing]


740
00:59:49.593 --> 00:59:51.718
[女]你能和我们在一起是我们的荣幸。
[woman] It's an honor to have you with us.


741
00:59:51.801 --> 00:59:53.260
[Lenka]我确信我在这里
[Lenka] I'm sure my being here


742
00:59:53.343 --> 00:59:55.135
和其他人没什么不同，但是谢谢你。
is no different to anybody else, but thank you.


743
00:59:55.218 --> 01:00:00.385
嗯。当然，但我们对所有的顾客都这么说，我们是认真的。
Hm. Of course, but we say this to all our patrons, and we mean it.


744
01:00:01.176 --> 01:00:02.593
我们对自己的任务很谦虚。
We are humble to our task.


745
01:00:03.218 --> 01:00:05.260
无论是出于选择还是不得已，
Whether it's by choice or by necessity,


746
01:00:05.343 --> 01:00:07.760
这不是一件容易的事。
this is not an easy thing to carry on your own.


747
01:00:09.218 --> 01:00:12.760
Útočiště是你的避难所或腹地，
Útočiště is your sanctuary or hinterland,


748
01:00:13.551 --> 01:00:14.926
你想要什么都行。
whatever you need it to be.


749
01:00:15.635 --> 01:00:16.801
[Lenka]谢谢。
[Lenka] Thank you.

[紧张的音乐播放]
[tense music plays]


752
01:00:46.176 --> 01:00:48.010
[哈努斯]根据我们所有的发现，
[Hanuš] With all our findings,


753
01:00:48.093 --> 01:00:51.468
你仍然专注于你的伟大发现。
you are still focused on your great discovery.


754
01:00:52.260 --> 01:00:54.926
[Jakub]我正在想办法联系到任务控制中心。
[Jakub] I'm focused on a way to reach Mission Control.


755
01:00:57.051 --> 01:00:58.843
[哈努斯]我们还没有结束。
[Hanuš] We're not done.


756
01:01:00.968 --> 01:01:03.010
你至少为我感到高兴吧?
[Jakub] Are you at least happy for me?


757
01:01:03.093 --> 01:01:04.260
是的。
Yeah.


758
01:01:04.343 --> 01:01:06.385
我当然是。(抽泣)
Of course I am. [sniffles]


759
01:01:06.468 --> 01:01:09.468
我为你感到高兴和骄傲。(抽泣)
I'm happy and proud of you. [sniffles]


760
01:01:10.176 --> 01:01:11.426
他们选择了你。
They chose you.


761
01:01:13.051 --> 01:01:14.760
[Jakub]我们会成功的。
[Jakub] We'll make it work.


762
01:01:14.843 --> 01:01:17.760
-我们在一起。你和我。——(Lenka抽泣)
-We're together in this. You and me. -[Lenka sniffles]


763
01:01:19.176 --> 01:01:20.635
答应我一件事。
[Lenka] Promise me one thing.


764
01:01:21.260 --> 01:01:24.510
答应我，我们还会按照之前说好的去做。
Promise me we're still going to do all the things we talked about.


765
01:01:25.510 --> 01:01:28.551
[Jakub]当然。我保证。
[Jakub] Of course. I promise.


766
01:01:30.676 --> 01:01:33.010
她感觉到你的谎言在她心里。
[Hanuš] She feels your lies inside her.


767
01:01:34.176 --> 01:01:36.510
你不知道你在说什么。
[Jakub] You don't know what you're talking about.


768
01:01:38.843 --> 01:01:40.926
你欢迎她的悲伤。
[Hanuš] You welcomed her sadness.


769
01:01:42.426 --> 01:01:44.260
所有这些破碎的誓言
All these broken pledges


770
01:01:45.010 --> 01:01:48.301
除了你的伟大发现。
except for the one you made to your great discovery.


771
01:01:49.801 --> 01:01:51.968
你怎么会看不见呢
How could you fail to see


772
01:01:52.051 --> 01:01:55.051
有一天，她会失去对你的信任?
that she, one day, would lose the will to believe in you?


773
01:02:05.676 --> 01:02:07.885
(键盘哔哔声)
[keypad beeping]


774

(线响)
[line ringing]


775
01:02:15.385 --> 01:02:16.801
加油，加油，加油。
Come on, come on, come on.


776
01:02:20.426 --> 01:02:21.593
[彼得]我是彼得。
[Peter] This is Peter.


777
01:02:21.676 --> 01:02:24.301
彼得，我是雅各布。我是CzechConnect的。
Peter, it's Jakub. I'm calling from the CzechConnect.


778
01:02:24.385 --> 01:02:26.510
我找到了重新配置它的方法。
I found a way to reconfigure it.


779
01:02:26.593 --> 01:02:29.468
无线电坏了，但这个好像有用。
The radio's down, but this seems to work.


780
01:02:30.385 --> 01:02:33.176
我不知道你能不能听到。彼得?
I don't know if you can hear me. Peter?


781
01:02:33.260 --> 01:02:36.426
(彼得紧张地笑)我们以为我们失去了联系。
[Peter chuckles nervously] We thought we lost communication.


782
01:02:36.510 --> 01:02:38.885
自从你消失后，这里的每个人都在执勤。
Everyone here has been on comms duty since you went dark.


783
01:02:38.968 --> 01:02:41.218
你黑了CzechConnect?这是难以置信的。
And you hacked the CzechConnect? That's unbelievable.


784
01:02:41.301 --> 01:02:42.135
是的。
Yeah.


785
01:02:42.218 --> 01:02:45.135
你还好吗?船还好吗?
Are you okay? Is the ship okay?


786
01:02:45.218 --> 01:02:46.551
是的，一切都是
Yes, everything is--


787
01:02:46.635 --> 01:02:48.426
(静态)
[static]


788
01:02:53.385 --> 01:02:55.260
哈努什:我还想看更多的东西。
[Hanuš] There is more I want to see.


789
01:02:57.176 --> 01:02:59.885
请不要总是说一切都会好起来的。
[Lenka] Please don't keep saying everything will be fine.


790
01:03:00.385 --> 01:03:01.468
[Jakub]但它会的。
[Jakub] But it will.


791
01:03:02.510 --> 01:03:03.843
你想得太多了。
You think too much.


792
01:03:05.801 --> 01:03:09.343
我知道已经一年了，但我们知道该怎么做。
I know it's a year, but we know how to do this.


793
01:03:10.760 --> 01:03:12.551
[Lenka]当你一个人的时候，事情总会发生。
[Lenka] Things happen when you're alone.


794
01:03:16.176 --> 01:03:17.551
[Jakub]我们会熬过去的。
[Jakub] We'll get through it.


795
01:03:18.385 --> 01:03:19.718
这是最后一次。
This is the last time.


796
01:03:21.051 --> 01:03:22.801
[Lenka]你也一直这么说。
[Lenka] You keep saying that too.


797
01:03:25.635 --> 01:03:26.885
你害怕吗?
Are you frightened?


798
01:03:27.635 --> 01:03:30.593
[Jakub]我告诉过你没什么好怕的。
[Jakub] I told you there's nothing to be afraid of.


799
01:03:31.926 --> 01:03:33.801
[Lenka]你就没想过成本吗?
[Lenka] Don't you ever think about the cost?


800
01:03:35.426 --> 01:03:37.385
我们为这一切付出的代价?
The price we have to pay for it all?


801
01:03:38.135 --> 01:03:39.135
你和我。
You and me.


802
01:03:40.176 --> 01:03:42.718
我很担心你。我不知道前方会发生什么。
I'm worried. I don't know what lies ahead.


803
01:03:43.801 --> 01:03:44.926
你为什么不呢?
Why aren't you?


804
01:03:48.510 --> 01:03:49.760
[哈努斯]我深信，
[Hanuš] With great conviction,


805
01:03:49.843 --> 01:03:52.301
你甚至没有试着去理解你的伴侣。
you do not even try to understand your mate.


806
01:03:53.343 --> 01:03:54.510
目的是什么?
To what end?


807
01:03:55.051 --> 01:03:57.676
与人沟通是不可能的
It is impossible to connect with someone


808
01:03:57.760 --> 01:04:00.426
除了他自己什么都不想看到，
who does not want to see anything but himself,


809
01:04:00.510 --> 01:04:04.551
他只在对自己有利的时候才想要联系。
who only wants to connect when it serves him.


810
01:04:04.635 --> 01:04:07.176
一开始，我以为这是你们的本性，
At first, I thought it was your kind's nature,


811
01:04:07.260 --> 01:04:09.593
自私,短视。
selfishness, shortsightedness.


812
01:04:09.676 --> 01:04:12.426
但通过你的蓝卡，我看到了。
But through your Lenka, I now see it.


813
01:04:13.593 --> 01:04:14.718
是你。
It is you.


814
01:04:15.510 --> 01:04:18.468
你的孤独是自己造成的。
Your loneliness is self-inflicted.


815
01:04:21.426 --> 01:04:23.551
我就不打扰你了。
I will leave you to your mission.


816
01:04:25.010 --> 01:04:27.051
怎么啦？Hanuš!
What? Hanuš!


817
01:04:27.135 --> 01:04:29.635
我对你的兴趣已经过期了。
[Hanuš] My interest in you has expired.


818
01:04:30.385 --> 01:04:31.510
你不能离开我。
[Jakub] You can't leave me.


819
01:04:33.676 --> 01:04:34.885
我需要你。
I need you.


820
01:04:36.218 --> 01:04:38.176
你帮助!我在听你说!
You're helping! I'm listening to you!


821
01:04:38.260 --> 01:04:39.968
[哈努斯]你没办法。
[Hanuš] You can't be helped.


822
01:04:40.468 --> 01:04:41.801
不!
No!


823
01:04:41.885 --> 01:04:42.760
(砰砰声)
[thuds]


824
01:04:43.885 --> 01:04:46.343
我希望你不要把手放在我身上。
[Hanuš] I prefer you do not place your hands on me.


825
01:04:48.426 --> 01:04:50.426
(紧张)
[straining]


826
01:04:52.551 --> 01:04:55.010
(喘气)
[panting]


827
01:04:56.593 --> 01:04:57.843
你不能走。
You can't leave.


828
01:05:00.885 --> 01:05:01.760
我需要——
I need to--


829
01:05:01.843 --> 01:05:05.176
[哈努斯]你需要带着一个非常不同的发现回来，
[Hanuš] You need to come back with a very different discovery,


830
01:05:05.926 --> 01:05:08.301
但你只能看到你自己。
but all you can see is yourself.


831
01:05:09.301 --> 01:05:11.593
祝你好运，瘦骨嶙峋的人。
Good luck, skinny human.


832
01:05:13.510 --> 01:05:14.510
Hanuš。
Hanuš.


833
01:05:15.718 --> 01:05:18.051
不!等等!
No! Wait!


834
01:05:40.468 --> 01:05:41.468
Hanuš吗?
Hanuš?


835
01:06:02.135 --> 01:06:03.551
请Hanuš。
Hanuš, please.


836
01:06:05.260 --> 01:06:06.551
我愿意做任何事。
I'll do anything.


837
01:06:08.385 --> 01:06:10.968
请Hanuš。我保证。
Hanuš, please. I promise.


838
01:06:11.051 --> 01:06:12.593
[迷人的音乐播放]
[captivating music playing]


839
01:06:25.218 --> 01:06:26.385
[Jakub]这是什么?
[Jakub] What is this?


840
01:06:28.010 --> 01:06:29.426
这是一个秘密的地方。
It's a secret place.


841
01:06:30.426 --> 01:06:31.843
你觉得呢?
What do you think?


842
01:06:32.593 --> 01:06:34.385
我想住在这里。
I think I want to live here.


843
01:06:37.885 --> 01:06:40.551
[Lenka]也许你想一起去执行任务。
[Lenka] Maybe you'd like to go on a mission together.


844
01:06:42.135 --> 01:06:44.135
也许你想和我交换秘密。
Maybe you'd like to trade secrets.


845
01:06:48.093 --> 01:06:49.718
也许你想吻我。
Maybe you'd like to kiss me.


846
01:06:51.343 --> 01:06:52.426
我会的。
I would.


847
01:06:54.093 --> 01:06:55.176
好了。
Nice.


848
01:07:04.593 --> 01:07:06.218
[]音乐逐渐变强
[music crescendos]


849
01:08:31.718 --> 01:08:33.218
(轻声哭泣)
[cries softly]


850
01:08:37.343 --> 01:08:39.051
(音乐消失)
[music fades]


851
01:08:54.551 --> 01:08:58.135
(电话响了)
[phone ringing]


852
01:09:03.468 --> 01:09:04.468
[Jakub]彼得!
[Jakub] Peter!


853
01:09:04.551 --> 01:09:06.760
搞什么鬼?你去哪儿了?
What the hell? Where did you go?


854
01:09:07.301 --> 01:09:10.385
我相信你能想象，这里有各种各样的原因造成了严重的恐慌。
There is a severe panic down here for all reasons I'm sure you can imagine.


855
01:09:10.468 --> 01:09:12.218
彼得，一切都好。
Peter, everything is okay.


856
01:09:13.135 --> 01:09:15.093
一切都没有偏离计划。
Nothing is deviating from plan.


857
01:09:15.176 --> 01:09:17.843
这艘船在做它设计的任务。
The ship is doing what it was designed to do.


858
01:09:18.801 --> 01:09:22.551
当通信中断或通信中断时，有一个行动方案，
There's a course of action for when or if communications break down,


859
01:09:22.635 --> 01:09:25.093
我正在按照每一个排练过的步骤
and I am following each of those rehearsed steps,


860
01:09:25.176 --> 01:09:27.135
包括解决这个问题。
including fixing that problem.


861
01:09:27.218 --> 01:09:28.676
你他妈的冷静点。
Calm the fuck down.


862
01:09:29.551 --> 01:09:30.593
给我提个醒。
Give me a heads-up.


863
01:09:31.760 --> 01:09:35.426
在此之前，我要你先去看看兰卡。
Before anything, I want you to go and see Lenka.


864
01:09:37.218 --> 01:09:38.760
怎么啦？为什么?
What? Why?


865
01:09:38.843 --> 01:09:40.468
现在我们有很多事要做。
Right now we have a lot going on.


866
01:09:40.551 --> 01:09:42.926
彼得。-韩国人就在你后面。
-Peter. -The South Koreans are right behind you.


867
01:09:43.885 --> 01:09:45.218
你得走了。
You are gonna go.


868
01:09:45.718 --> 01:09:46.760
[彼得]做什么?
[Peter] To do what?


869
01:09:48.051 --> 01:09:51.968
[深深地呼吸]
[all breathing deeply]


870
01:09:52.051 --> 01:09:53.510
Lenka Prochazka吗?
Lenka Procházka?


871
01:10:11.635 --> 01:10:12.801
哦，他还活着。
Oh, he's alive.


872
01:10:13.718 --> 01:10:15.635
妈的，彼得!
For fuck's sake, Peter!


873
01:10:16.968 --> 01:10:17.926
[松了口气]
[sighs in relief]


874
01:10:19.051 --> 01:10:22.260
我得跟你谈谈，兰卡。请给我五分钟。
I need to talk to you, Lenka. Five minutes, please.


875
01:10:29.135 --> 01:10:30.760
我不是来干涉的。
I'm not here to interfere.


876
01:10:32.968 --> 01:10:35.551
不管发生了什么，那是你们俩之间的事。
Whatever is going on, that's between the two of you.


877
01:10:38.176 --> 01:10:41.426
但为了这次任务的安全考虑，
But in the interest of the safety of the mission and the stakes,


878
01:10:42.801 --> 01:10:46.260
我现在要尽我所能减轻雅各布的精神状态。
I need to do what I can to alleviate Jakub's mental state right now.


879
01:10:47.301 --> 01:10:48.885
我希望你能理解。
I hope you can understand that.


880
01:10:50.135 --> 01:10:51.176
彼得……
Peter…


881
01:10:53.301 --> 01:10:54.301
我不能。
I can't.


882
01:10:54.885 --> 01:10:57.593
他想让你听。这是所有。
He wants you to listen. That's all.


883
01:11:03.093 --> 01:11:05.426
[彼得深吸一口气]
[Peter breathes deeply]


884
01:11:06.635 --> 01:11:10.635
[电话键盘哔哔声]
[phone keypad beeping]


885
01:11:12.593 --> 01:11:14.260
(彼得低声说)我在外面。
[Peter whispers] I'll be outside.


886
01:11:19.468 --> 01:11:21.885
[Jakub] Lenka，我希望你在那里。
[Jakub] Lenka, I hope you're there.


887
01:11:27.718 --> 01:11:30.343
我现在明白了。我做的事。
I get it now. I do.


888
01:11:33.135 --> 01:11:36.885
你还记得我说过我想看看木星以外的地方吗?
Do you remember when I said I wanted to see beyond Jupiter?


889
01:11:38.135 --> 01:11:40.801
我想不出还有什么比这更糟的了。
I can't imagine anything worse now.


890
01:11:43.426 --> 01:11:45.010
我只想回家。
I just want to come home.


891
01:11:48.301 --> 01:11:52.010
当我们相遇时，我有生以来第一次感到安全。
When we met, I felt safe for the first time in my life.


892
01:11:56.260 --> 01:12:01.968
现在我怎么也弄不明白，为什么我一直把你抛在身后
And now I can't, for the life of me, understand why I kept leaving you behind


893
01:12:03.468 --> 01:12:05.760
当你是我唯一在乎的时候。
when you're the only thing that matters.


894
01:12:08.801 --> 01:12:10.760
你努力去了解我。
You tried hard to know me.


895
01:12:11.260 --> 01:12:14.926
我很抱歉我从来没有真正努力去了解你。
I am so sorry I never made a real effort to know you.


896
01:12:19.551 --> 01:12:22.926
你就在我面前，我却没看见你。
You were right there in front of me, and I didn't see you.


897
01:12:28.093 --> 01:12:31.010
我的一生都是为了错误的理由而活。
I have lived a life for all the wrong reasons.


898
01:12:34.260 --> 01:12:35.843
真是他妈的浪费。
What a fucking waste.


899
01:12:41.010 --> 01:12:42.426
我配不上你。
I don't deserve you.


900
01:12:44.510 --> 01:12:46.635
-我从来没有。——(叹息)
-And I never have. -[sighs]


901
01:12:48.010 --> 01:12:51.676
[Jakub]如果我能再来一次，我会做得更好。
[Jakub] If I could do it again, I'd do it better.


902
01:12:51.760 --> 01:12:52.843
(Lenka抽泣)
[Lenka sniffles]


903
01:12:53.885 --> 01:12:57.051
[雅库布]我永远不会违背这个承诺。
[Jakub] And that's a promise I would never ever break.


904
01:13:00.343 --> 01:13:03.760
如果我…如果我能再来一次。
If I… If I could do it again.


905
01:13:06.343 --> 01:13:07.593
我很抱歉。
I'm sorry.


906
01:13:08.551 --> 01:13:10.635
我很抱歉。
I'm so sorry.


907
01:13:11.676 --> 01:13:13.593
[忧郁的音乐播放]
[melancholy music playing]


908
01:13:28.135 --> 01:13:29.510
(哭)
[crying]


909
01:13:56.676 --> 01:13:59.760
[忧郁的音乐继续]
[melancholy music continues]


910
01:14:27.385 --> 01:14:29.260
(音乐消失)
[music fades]


911
01:14:38.385 --> 01:14:39.426
[Jakub] Hanuš吗?
[Jakub] Hanuš?


912
01:14:39.926 --> 01:14:41.510
我能感觉到你在到处乱摸。
I can feel you poking around.


913
01:14:42.426 --> 01:14:43.968
你还在这儿吗?
Are you still here?


914
01:14:48.551 --> 01:14:49.968
哈努斯:你现在应该休息了。
[Hanuš] You should rest now.


915
01:14:52.510 --> 01:14:53.926
我，我真的很乐意。
I-- I'd really like that.


916
01:14:54.801 --> 01:14:55.968
[Hanuš)休息。
[Hanuš] Rest.


917
01:15:08.968 --> 01:15:11.718
你被净化了，瘦弱的人类。
You have purged, skinny human.


918
01:15:12.635 --> 01:15:13.718
我看到了。
I saw it.


919
01:15:15.593 --> 01:15:16.551
休息。
Rest.


920
01:15:25.843 --> 01:15:28.301
[哈努斯喘着粗气]
[Hanuš breathing heavily]


921
01:15:32.010 --> 01:15:33.760
我不是故意吵醒你的。
I did not mean to wake you.


922
01:15:35.510 --> 01:15:37.093
别再那样对我了。
Don't do that to me again.


923
01:15:38.051 --> 01:15:39.218
别离开我。
Don't leave me.


924
01:15:40.301 --> 01:15:43.010
我不能让你独自面对起点。
[Hanuš] I cannot let you face the Beginning alone.


925
01:15:43.926 --> 01:15:48.468
我开始明白，我也不想一个人呆着。
I've come to understand that I don't want to be alone for that either.


926
01:15:56.885 --> 01:15:58.051
你还好吗?
Are you okay?


927
01:16:01.010 --> 01:16:03.718
[Hanuš喘息)
[Hanuš wheezing]


928
01:16:05.051 --> 01:16:08.218
你怎么了?
Wha-- What's happening to you?


929
01:16:10.593 --> 01:16:14.426
(哈努什颤抖地吸了口气)我之前没有对你完全诚实。
[Hanuš inhales shakily] I was not entirely honest with you before.


930
01:16:17.343 --> 01:16:18.593
关于什么?
About what?


931
01:16:19.176 --> 01:16:22.093
我跟你说了哥罗柏人来找我们了。
I told you the Gorompeds came for us.


932
01:16:22.760 --> 01:16:26.343
他们吞噬了我们的后代，我们的长辈。
They consumed our offspring, our elders.


933
01:16:26.426 --> 01:16:28.301
所以我逃离了我的世界。
So I fled my world.


934
01:16:28.385 --> 01:16:29.968
但我逃得太晚了。
But I fled too late.


935
01:16:30.968 --> 01:16:32.343
你吓到我了。
You're scaring me.


936
01:16:33.093 --> 01:16:35.093
[哈努斯]为什么害怕真相?
[Hanuš] Why fear a truth?


937
01:16:35.676 --> 01:16:37.885
这不是我的方式，
This is not the way of my kind,


938
01:16:38.551 --> 01:16:41.176
但这就是人类的生活方式。
but it is the way of humans.


939
01:16:43.010 --> 01:16:49.468
我开始明白为什么白日梦和噩梦，
I'm starting to understand why daydreams and nightmares,


940
01:16:49.551 --> 01:16:51.385
它们都是本质上的。
they are both of essence.


941
01:16:55.426 --> 01:16:57.426
你怎么什么都不说?
[Jakub] Why didn't you say anything?


942
01:17:00.093 --> 01:17:02.176
你从来没问过我。
You never asked about me.


943
01:17:03.551 --> 01:17:06.260

这让我想起了那件事。
This reminds me of that.

我去哪里你就去哪里，你去哪里我就去哪里。宇航员?
[Lenka] You go where I go, and I go where you go. Right, Spaceman?

我来了!
[boy] I'm coming!


1108
01:30:33.510 --> 01:30:37.968
一切都是永恒的，但没有什么是永恒的。
[Hanuš] Everything is permanent, yet nothing ever is.


1109
01:30:38.051 --> 01:30:40.260
(Jakub)真的吗?这是小?
[Jakub] Really? It's tiny?

[Lenka]你有没有想过

1113
01:30:46.926 --> 01:30:50.218
你在晚年学到了什么?
what you've learned a little bit late in life?


1114

Hanuš! Incredible!


1125
01:31:32.426 --> 01:31:37.635
[哈努斯]瘦弱的人类，宇宙就是它应该有的样子。
[Hanuš] Skinny human, the universe is as it should be.


1126
01:31:38.468 --> 01:31:40.218
[Jakub]是的。
[Jakub] Yes, it is.


1127
01:31:41.218 --> 01:31:42.801
我所知甚少。
How little I knew.


1128
01:31:47.551 --> 01:31:49.926
但有一件事我一直都很清楚。
But there's one thing I've always known.


1129
01:31:52.510 --> 01:31:54.135
来，我指给你看。
Come, let me show you.


1130
01:31:57.218 --> 01:31:58.801
[哈努斯]这是开始。
[Hanuš] This is the Beginning.


1131
01:31:59.468 --> 01:32:00.468
用你的蓝卡。
With your Lenka.


1132
01:32:01.843 --> 01:32:03.426
你没事吧，太空人?
You all right there, Spaceman?


1133
01:32:04.051 --> 01:32:09.468
[Jakub]我第一次见到她，就知道我希望她过得好。
[Jakub] The first moment I saw her, I knew I wanted good things for her.


1134
01:32:11.426 --> 01:32:13.801
就算我什么都不知道，我也知道。
If I don't know anything else, I know that.


1135
01:32:20.176 --> 01:32:23.801
要是我一直像那时那样看她就好了。
If only I saw her always like I saw her then.


1136
01:32:26.426 --> 01:32:29.635
[哈努斯]你能见到她已经是个奇迹了。
[Hanuš] That you saw her at all is a miracle.


1137
01:32:32.010 --> 01:32:36.343
[Jakub]我和她不太可能见面，
[Jakub] It's all so unlikely that she and I would meet,


1138
01:32:37.301 --> 01:32:38.885
你和我会见面
that you and I would meet.


1139
01:32:38.968 --> 01:32:41.926
[哈努斯]然而我们在这里。
[Hanuš] Yet here we are.

你以为这就是你想要的一切，
You thought this was everything you wanted,


1141
01:32:48.468 --> 01:32:50.926
这里没有什么，雅各布?
so what's not here, Jakub?


1142
01:32:52.426 --> 01:32:53.801
[Jakub]她不在这里。
[Jakub] She's not here.


1143
01:33:01.093 --> 01:33:02.926
时间到了，不是吗?
It's time, isn't it?


1144
01:33:07.426 --> 01:33:09.551
我感觉你在悄悄溜走。
I feel you slipping away.


1145
01:33:09.635 --> 01:33:13.885
[哈努斯]是的，这是不可避免的。
[Hanuš] Yes, it is inevitable.


1146
01:33:13.968 --> 01:33:16.093
这并非没有恐惧，
It's not without some fear,


1147
01:33:17.135 --> 01:33:20.176
但我现在可以离开你了。
but I can leave you now.


1148
01:33:22.635 --> 01:33:24.468
我给你带了点东西。
[Jakub] I brought something for you.


1149
01:33:26.468 --> 01:33:27.843
舒缓的。
For soothing.


1150
01:33:34.718 --> 01:33:35.843
[哈努斯]谢谢。
[Hanuš] Thank you.


1151
01:33:37.676 --> 01:33:41.510
我在这里开始，也在这里结束。
I begin and I end here.

Now I feel fear.

[哈努斯]跟你一样。
[Hanuš] As you do.


1155
01:34:07.926 --> 01:34:14.176
但你也对自己抱有希望，你的兰卡。
But you also feel hope for you, your Lenka.


1156
01:34:15.801 --> 01:34:19.843
这就是你们部落的智慧。
That is the wisdom of your tribe.


1157
01:34:22.468 --> 01:34:23.760
你能听到她说话吗?
Can you hear her?


1158
01:34:24.801 --> 01:34:26.426
[Jakub]我什么都听不见。
[Jakub] I can't hear anything.


1159
01:34:28.135 --> 01:34:30.135
[哈努斯]倾听寂静。
[Hanuš] Listen to the silence.


1160
01:34:35.885 --> 01:34:39.635
谢谢你，哈努斯。为我所做的一切。
Thank you, Hanuš. For everything.
