2
00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:54.290
Hey, watch where you're
going, you old klutz...


3
00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:56.790
- Sorry. Sorry.
- You gonna pick that up?


4
00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:58.790
Pervert.

5
00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:01.490
You're late. l've been
looking all over for you.


6
00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:04.790
l slept right through the alarm clock.
That baby kept me up all night.


7
00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:09.090
- What baby?
- l don't know. Our neighbors have a kid?


8
00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:11.790
Our neighbors are 90 years old.

9
00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:16.390
You want to try and get
the paint on the canvas.


10
00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:18.190
l like it messy.

11
00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:22.490
Oh, yeah?
l gotta go.


12
00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:26.890
Hey-

13
00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:38.290
l just start drinking
and doing a lot of,like, pills.


14
00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:41.690
'Cause then it just kills the pain,
and then l can just deal with it later.


15
00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:46.290
l'm just saying- l'm not
telling you to go drink.


16
00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:50.090
l know you go to meetings.
l'm just telling you what works for me, okay?


17
00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:54.490
lt's hard to deal with those feelings.
Well, drinking kills feelings. That's why.


18
00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:58.690
lt's gonna hail this afternoon.

19
00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:02.890
You think?
Looks pretty sunny to me.


20
00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:05.690
Who the fuck are you?

21
00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:08.690
l'm Dr. Sam Foster.
You must be Henry.


22
00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:11.190
Where's Dr. Levy?

23
00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:13.690
Didn't she get in touch with you?

24
00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:15.890
No.

25
00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:18.890
Oh, l'm sorry.
She's away for a while.


26
00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:21.690
- l'm covering for her.
- She's away where?


27
00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:24.890
She's not feeling well.
She'll be back in a couple of weeks.


28
00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:29.090
What are you-
a substitute shrink?


29
00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:33.790
l guess you could call me that.

30
00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:36.690
Oh.

31
00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:39.090
This is her office.

32
00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:43.890
Yeah, we share it. l'm only here
a few hours a week. Please take a seat.


33
00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:46.590
Oh, l see.

34
00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:50.490
So you treat the, uh...

35
00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:53.690
depressed investment bankers,
paranoid housewives all week?


36
00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:57.090
Come up here to do
a little pro bono work?


37
00:04:57.290 --> 00:04:59.090
lt's the other way around.

38
00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:03.090
The bankers are paranoid,
and the housewives are depressed.


39
00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:09.590
Now,you're a junior at the college.
ls that right? Majoring in fine art?


40
00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:16.590
She passed me off to you, huh?

41
00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:22.290
You get the hard cases.

42
00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:26.290
Does it make you uncomfortable
that l'm filling in for her?


43
00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:31.790
She was trying to help me.

44
00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:33.990
l'll try and help you too.

45
00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:39.290
She afraid of me?
ls that why she's gone?


46
00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:41.590
Did l scare her?

47
00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:44.390
Should she be afraid of you?

48
00:05:57.790 --> 00:05:59.890
l've read your file.

49
00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:02.490
And can l read your file?

50
00:06:04.290 --> 00:06:06.190
Tell me why you're here.

51
00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:08.490
l thought you read the file.

52
00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:12.390
You torched your car.
Why?


53
00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:16.790
l don't remember.
l just woke up...


54
00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:19.490
and l was in the car,
and it was on fire.


55
00:06:19.790 --> 00:06:23.490
ls that something you do-
set fires?


56
00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:29.290
l didn't mean to hurt anybody.

57
00:06:30.690 --> 00:06:33.590
Who did you hurt?

58
00:06:37.090 --> 00:06:39.990
l don't know.
l'm gonna go.


59
00:06:40.190 --> 00:06:42.590
No. Please, sit down.
We have more time.


60
00:06:42.790 --> 00:06:45.590
No, l, uh- l'm gonna go home
before this hail starts.


61
00:06:45.790 --> 00:06:49.990
The king of Poland goes hunting
in the woods with one ofhis assistants.


62
00:06:50.290 --> 00:06:52.090
And they're looking around...

63
00:06:52.390 --> 00:06:55.690
and suddenly on the other side
of the clearing a farmer walks by.


64
00:06:55.990 --> 00:06:58.390
Hold still.

65
00:06:58.490 --> 00:07:00.590
And the king raises his rifle,
and the farmer yells...


66
00:07:00.790 --> 00:07:02.690
''l'm not a moose.''

67
00:07:02.790 --> 00:07:05.490
The king shoots
and kills the guy...


68
00:07:05.790 --> 00:07:07.690
and the assistant's shocked.

69
00:07:07.690 --> 00:07:09.890
And he says...

70
00:07:10.090 --> 00:07:13.590
''Sire, the man said,
l'm not a moose.''


71
00:07:13.890 --> 00:07:17.690
''Oh, says the king.
l thought he said, l am a moose.''


72
00:07:21.590 --> 00:07:23.590
lt's a joke.

73
00:07:23.790 --> 00:07:26.190
No, l'm just trying
to figure out...


74
00:07:26.290 --> 00:07:29.290
if l'm the king or the farmer.

75
00:07:30.890 --> 00:07:33.890
You're the moose.

76
00:07:34.090 --> 00:07:37.890
- l'm the moose?
- Yeah.


77
00:07:41.190 --> 00:07:43.790
Well, l appear to be the moose.

78
00:07:45.390 --> 00:07:48.390
- lt's shit.
- lt's not shit.


79
00:07:49.790 --> 00:07:52.590
lt's not shit.

80
00:08:03.190 --> 00:08:05.690
Still there.

81
00:08:05.890 --> 00:08:08.490
Sometimes l forget.

82
00:08:11.790 --> 00:08:14.290
They're from another life.

83
00:08:30.590 --> 00:08:32.490
Oh, my God.

84
00:08:44.090 --> 00:08:46.390
l love this song.

85
00:08:56.290 --> 00:09:00.890
l know you. Psych 221.
Professor Azzopardi?


86
00:09:03.390 --> 00:09:06.490
You did that presentation on psychosis
and Tristan Reveur, right?


87
00:09:06.690 --> 00:09:09.690
No smoking on the train.

88
00:09:11.690 --> 00:09:14.390
Look at the sign, fella.
No smoking.


89
00:09:17.990 --> 00:09:20.890
Capisce? Put it out.

90
00:09:21.090 --> 00:09:23.390
''Capisce''?

91
00:09:26.290 --> 00:09:29.390
Put out the fucking cigarette.

92
00:09:41.090 --> 00:09:43.890
You oughta be locked up,
you asshole.


93
00:09:52.990 --> 00:09:56.090
Beth? Sam. l hope
you're getting some rest.


94
00:09:57.990 --> 00:10:00.990
Look, l met with your
patient today- Henry Letham.


95
00:10:01.190 --> 00:10:03.590
l'd really like
to talk to you about him.


96
00:10:03.790 --> 00:10:07.090
Give me a call, okay?
l wanna hear your voice.


97
00:10:08.990 --> 00:10:12.590
You don't think it's a little odd-
predicting a hailstorm like that?


98
00:10:12.890 --> 00:10:14.890
So he watches the Weather Channel.

99
00:10:15.090 --> 00:10:18.290
No. l looked in the newspaper.
There was nothing about hail today.


100
00:10:19.890 --> 00:10:21.790
How's Beth?

101
00:10:21.990 --> 00:10:25.490
l don't know.
She hasn't returned any of my calls.


102
00:10:25.690 --> 00:10:27.690
She always kinda
liked you, didn't she?


103
00:10:30.090 --> 00:10:32.490
What, are you jealous?

104
00:10:32.690 --> 00:10:34.490
Of Beth?

105
00:10:34.690 --> 00:10:37.490
- l'm just faking it.
- Your students love you.


106
00:10:37.690 --> 00:10:41.190
My students love me
'cause l give 'em all A's.


107
00:10:41.490 --> 00:10:45.490
l mean, what the fuck do l know?
This kid could be the next Rothko.


108
00:11:01.690 --> 00:11:03.790
Tell me l'm good.

109
00:11:03.990 --> 00:11:05.790
You're good.

110
00:11:05.990 --> 00:11:08.490
Tell me they'll remember me.

111
00:11:08.690 --> 00:11:11.090
Who's ''they''?

112
00:11:11.290 --> 00:11:13.690
The world.

113
00:11:13.890 --> 00:11:16.690
ls that what you want?

114
00:11:19.990 --> 00:11:22.090
The world will remember you.

115
00:11:25.190 --> 00:11:27.390
Now take off your clothes.

116
00:11:45.090 --> 00:11:46.290
Hey.

117
00:11:54.490 --> 00:11:56.990
Who did that?

118
00:11:57.190 --> 00:11:59.290
My girlfriend.

119
00:11:59.390 --> 00:12:01.690
Where'd you get that?

120
00:12:01.890 --> 00:12:04.990
This? l bought it.

121
00:12:11.190 --> 00:12:13.590
Henry, what are you
doing here? l-


122
00:12:13.790 --> 00:12:16.790
l wasn't expecting you.
l have someone coming in.


123
00:12:24.990 --> 00:12:27.990
So, have you considered
a career in meteorology?


124
00:12:28.390 --> 00:12:29.890
Hmm?

125
00:12:29.890 --> 00:12:33.490
The weatherman
said something about hail?


126
00:12:33.790 --> 00:12:36.390
The weatherman?

127
00:12:37.990 --> 00:12:39.790
No.

128
00:12:41.590 --> 00:12:44.590
You know, l can't even
listen to him anymore?


129
00:12:47.390 --> 00:12:50.190
l don't understand a word
that comes out of his mouth.


130
00:12:50.490 --> 00:12:52.590
You don't understand
the weatherman?


131
00:12:52.790 --> 00:12:54.590
No.

132
00:12:57.590 --> 00:13:00.090
But you do?

133
00:13:00.390 --> 00:13:03.190
Sure. He says rain,
l bring an umbrella.


134
00:13:09.990 --> 00:13:12.690
Henry, give me something.

135
00:13:14.590 --> 00:13:17.190
l'm good at what l do.

136
00:13:18.990 --> 00:13:21.390
Well, l'm hearing voices now.

137
00:13:23.490 --> 00:13:25.490
Voices?

138
00:13:28.390 --> 00:13:32.690
They come and they go,
but when they are there-


139
00:13:32.990 --> 00:13:35.590
You're hearing them now?

140
00:13:35.690 --> 00:13:37.790
Okay.

141
00:13:40.990 --> 00:13:43.790
Can you write down
what they're saying?


142
00:13:52.790 --> 00:13:55.190
- Yeah?
Hey, Dr. Foster. lt's Frederick.


143
00:14:04.290 --> 00:14:06.590
Can you read it to me?

144
00:14:07.890 --> 00:14:10.390
- Hmm?
- Can you read it to me?


145
00:14:12.590 --> 00:14:14.790
Uh, yeah.

146
00:14:14.990 --> 00:14:17.690
''Hey, Dr. Foster. lt's Frederick.''

147
00:14:19.390 --> 00:14:23.290
This is-This voice isn't in your head.
This is a real voice.


148
00:14:27.990 --> 00:14:31.490
Okay. Well, l don't know.

149
00:14:31.690 --> 00:14:34.590
Maybe you could show me
how to tell the difference?


150
00:14:36.190 --> 00:14:37.990
Go on.

151
00:14:38.290 --> 00:14:40.090
l don't know.

152
00:14:45.890 --> 00:14:49.190
''l didn't move him.
l know you're not supposed to move 'em.''


153
00:14:49.390 --> 00:14:52.290
''l can't watch anymore.''

154
00:14:52.590 --> 00:14:57.490
''Stay with me, Henry.
Stay with me.''


155
00:14:57.790 --> 00:15:01.890
Hey, guys. Sorry
to interrupt, but, uh-


156
00:15:02.190 --> 00:15:04.790
Hey, Frederick,
can you give me a minute?


157
00:15:04.990 --> 00:15:07.990
- l've got a conference call at 11:00.
-Just a minute. Thank you.


158
00:15:08.290 --> 00:15:10.490
Yeah, okay.

159
00:15:14.990 --> 00:15:17.890
Where's this from?

160
00:15:19.290 --> 00:15:21.990
Oh, l burned myself.

161
00:15:22.190 --> 00:15:24.690
You burned yourself? Why?

162
00:15:27.590 --> 00:15:29.590
Practicing for hell.

163
00:15:31.090 --> 00:15:33.190
Why do you think
you're going to hell?


164
00:15:33.390 --> 00:15:35.490
Um...

165
00:15:39.290 --> 00:15:41.090
'cause of what l did.

166
00:15:42.690 --> 00:15:44.890
What l'm gonna do.

167
00:15:45.090 --> 00:15:47.590
What are you gonna do?

168
00:15:54.590 --> 00:15:56.790
You're gonna try and kill yourself?

169
00:15:58.590 --> 00:16:00.890
And how seriously should l take that?

170
00:16:01.090 --> 00:16:03.690
Saturday at midnight
is when l'm gonna do it.


171
00:16:03.890 --> 00:16:06.390
You gotta know that
everything just changed.


172
00:16:06.590 --> 00:16:09.790
lf you talk to me about suicide,
l'm required to take certain actions.


173
00:16:09.990 --> 00:16:13.290
Hey, look.Just wait a second.
Wait a second.


174
00:16:13.490 --> 00:16:14.590
Just, you know, deal with him...

175
00:16:14.590 --> 00:16:17.490
Just, you know, deal with him...

176
00:16:17.790 --> 00:16:21.690
and, uh, we'll talk
about it next time.


177
00:16:21.890 --> 00:16:24.190
There's a next time?

178
00:16:24.390 --> 00:16:26.190
Yeah.

179
00:16:26.490 --> 00:16:28.490
Yeah.

180
00:16:31.090 --> 00:16:33.690
Yeah, we got three days.

181
00:16:37.090 --> 00:16:39.290
He's coming! He's coming!

182
00:16:39.490 --> 00:16:44.290
l am not a monster, goddamn you!
Get off of me!


183
00:16:44.690 --> 00:16:47.990
Nobody's calling you a monster,
Daisy. Come on now.


184
00:16:48.090 --> 00:16:51.290
Please! You said you would-
l don't deserve this!


185
00:16:51.490 --> 00:16:54.690
Well, if you'd just remember to take your pills,
you wouldn't have to go through this.


186
00:16:54.990 --> 00:16:58.790
- l'm not a monster. l'm lovable.
- l know you are.


187
00:16:58.990 --> 00:17:02.390
l'm lovable. Stop!

188
00:17:02.790 --> 00:17:05.590
- No, please! l'm lovable.
- Very lovable.


189
00:17:05.790 --> 00:17:08.490
He's coming!
l oughta know he's coming!


190
00:17:08.690 --> 00:17:11.990
l'll be good. l'll be good!
l don't want to- No!


191
00:17:12.390 --> 00:17:14.190
- Hey, Sammy.
- Hey.


192
00:17:14.390 --> 00:17:16.890
He's just a kid!
He's just a kid!


193
00:17:17.090 --> 00:17:19.790
Okay, now.
Let go, Daisy.


194
00:17:19.990 --> 00:17:22.190
He's just a kid!

195
00:17:22.390 --> 00:17:24.190
He's just a kid!

196
00:17:24.390 --> 00:17:26.890
Sorry about that.
You okay?


197
00:17:27.090 --> 00:17:30.790
Yeah. Yeah. l'm used to dealing
with neurotic stockbrokers.


198
00:17:31.090 --> 00:17:33.290
Neurotic stockbrokers pay better.

199
00:17:35.290 --> 00:17:37.690
So, uh, what brings you
to Club Meds?


200
00:17:37.890 --> 00:17:40.190
l have a student
threatening to kill himself.


201
00:17:40.390 --> 00:17:43.290
Christ. Well, tell him
to take a number.


202
00:17:43.590 --> 00:17:45.390
Look, you know how it works.

203
00:17:45.490 --> 00:17:48.090
lf he threatens to hurt
himself or someone else...


204
00:17:48.490 --> 00:17:51.490
then we can take him in,
but we can't hold him here forever.


205
00:17:51.690 --> 00:17:53.590
He said he's gonna
do it on Saturday.


206
00:17:53.790 --> 00:17:55.890
lf you take him in now,
he'll be out by then.


207
00:17:56.090 --> 00:17:58.790
Organized kid.
He's got it all scheduled.


208
00:17:58.990 --> 00:18:01.390
Saturday, midnight.
That's what he said.


209
00:18:02.990 --> 00:18:05.990
We can pick him up Friday,
hold him for the weekend.


210
00:18:06.190 --> 00:18:08.590
As you can see, it's
not a real fun process.


211
00:18:08.790 --> 00:18:11.390
Anything you could do to avoid it?

212
00:18:11.590 --> 00:18:13.990
- What have you got him on?
- He won't take any meds.


213
00:18:43.890 --> 00:18:46.390
Where's my man?

214
00:18:48.590 --> 00:18:50.990
You know what l've
been craving all day?


215
00:18:55.890 --> 00:18:58.390
Something to drink.

216
00:19:03.990 --> 00:19:06.490
What's the matter?
You're looking a little tense.


217
00:19:06.690 --> 00:19:08.990
lt's nothing.

218
00:19:09.190 --> 00:19:11.690
So tell me about nothing.

219
00:19:14.390 --> 00:19:16.190
l'm just tired.

220
00:19:16.390 --> 00:19:19.790
Let me make a call,
and then we can take a bath together.


221
00:19:22.990 --> 00:19:25.290
Beth, it's Sam again.

222
00:19:25.490 --> 00:19:28.090
Um, l hope
you're getting some rest.


223
00:19:28.190 --> 00:19:31.790
Everyone's been asking about you.
Look, give me a call.


224
00:19:32.190 --> 00:19:36.290
l want to speak to you about Henry Letham
and find out how you're feeling, okay?


225
00:19:37.690 --> 00:19:39.590
Bye.

226
00:19:42.290 --> 00:19:45.090
You sound like you're talking
to one of your patients.


227
00:19:45.290 --> 00:19:49.290
- ls she sick?
- She's exhausted.


228
00:19:49.590 --> 00:19:51.490
Exhausted?

229
00:19:52.990 --> 00:19:56.290
Come on. We live in New York City.
Everyone's exhausted.


230
00:19:56.490 --> 00:19:58.690
- What, is that a code word?

231
00:20:00.390 --> 00:20:02.190
Yeah.

232
00:20:04.290 --> 00:20:06.290
Yeah, l guess it is.

233
00:20:18.690 --> 00:20:22.290
How's the kid with the hail?

234
00:20:22.590 --> 00:20:24.790
Ever heard of
doctor-patient privilege?


235
00:20:24.990 --> 00:20:27.390
What's the prediction
tomorrow? Locusts?


236
00:20:27.590 --> 00:20:29.690
He's confused.

237
00:20:29.790 --> 00:20:33.190
Confused?
ls that like exhausted?


238
00:20:33.390 --> 00:20:35.490
l don't want to get
into this right now.


239
00:20:35.690 --> 00:20:39.390
You told me about the lawyer
who thought her cat was talking to her.


240
00:20:39.690 --> 00:20:41.690
l shouldn't have.

241
00:20:45.390 --> 00:20:47.790
He wants to kill himself.

242
00:20:47.990 --> 00:20:52.090
That's it, isn't it?
That's why you won't talk about it.


243
00:20:54.190 --> 00:20:57.490
- He has a right to confidential counseling.
- Come on, Sam.


244
00:21:02.690 --> 00:21:05.890
He wants to kill himself
on Saturday night.


245
00:21:07.490 --> 00:21:09.990
At midnight, like it's a date.

246
00:21:15.190 --> 00:21:17.190
What's so special about Saturday?

247
00:21:17.390 --> 00:21:20.190
l didn't have time to ask.

248
00:21:20.390 --> 00:21:23.790
Look, we can talk
about it, you know.


249
00:21:24.090 --> 00:21:25.990
lt doesn't scare me.

250
00:21:26.190 --> 00:21:29.290
- lt scares me.
- Yeah, l know.


251
00:21:29.490 --> 00:21:32.390
But you have to trust me.

252
00:21:33.990 --> 00:21:35.790
l do.

253
00:21:47.990 --> 00:21:50.790
- Up slow,Jerry.
- Got it.


254
00:21:50.990 --> 00:21:52.890
- Looking good, Mikey.
- Not  - Not so fast.


255
00:21:52.990 --> 00:21:54.890
- Stop that swaying.
- Come on, Mommy. Faster.


256
00:21:55.090 --> 00:21:58.490
Easy. Easy. Hold it!
Stay clear, you guys. Quick.


257
00:21:58.690 --> 00:22:01.890
Wait! Wait! My balloon!

258
00:22:02.090 --> 00:22:04.390
Sorry, kid.
lt's gone to balloon heaven.


259
00:22:04.690 --> 00:22:07.490
Oh, that's okay, sir.
We're gonna get another one at the park.


260
00:22:07.690 --> 00:22:09.990
- Go ahead, honey.
- Promise, Mommy?


261
00:22:10.190 --> 00:22:12.390
All right, you guys.
Comin' your way.


262
00:22:12.590 --> 00:22:14.590
Tristan Reveur once said...

263
00:22:14.790 --> 00:22:18.790
''lf we cannot see the wind,
we can see the wind's will.''


264
00:22:20.290 --> 00:22:24.490
Here, Pradilla Ortiz forces us
to imagine the wind...


265
00:22:24.790 --> 00:22:26.690
by showing its effect
on the smoke...


266
00:22:26.890 --> 00:22:30.190
the candle flames
and Dona Juana's veil.


267
00:22:32.490 --> 00:22:35.890
Only the victims' faces are
visible in Goya's masterwork.


268
00:22:37.490 --> 00:22:41.490
Our eyes are drawn
to the brightest spot on the canvas-


269
00:22:41.690 --> 00:22:46.490
the white shirt of a doomed man
pleading for his life.


270
00:22:46.790 --> 00:22:49.690
Behind him, the hill closing in...

271
00:22:49.890 --> 00:22:52.990
refusing a path to escape.

272
00:22:53.290 --> 00:22:57.290
- The Dead Toreador was originally
part of a larger painting...


273
00:22:57.590 --> 00:23:00.490
lncident in a Bullfight.

274
00:23:00.690 --> 00:23:04.990
After the painting was mocked
by critics and viewers...


275
00:23:05.290 --> 00:23:07.590
Manet angrily sliced it in half...

276
00:23:07.790 --> 00:23:09.990
removing the fallen hero
from his arena...


277
00:23:10.090 --> 00:23:11.690
removing the fallen hero
from his arena...


278
00:23:11.890 --> 00:23:16.690
and accidentally creating
one ofhis most enduring works.


279
00:23:16.990 --> 00:23:19.590
- Hey.
- Hey.


280
00:23:19.890 --> 00:23:22.190
How are you doing?

281
00:23:22.390 --> 00:23:24.190
Oh, you know.

282
00:23:24.390 --> 00:23:28.390
l didn't know if you'd still be coming
to class after what you told me.


283
00:23:28.690 --> 00:23:31.490
Yeah, well, where else
am l gonna go?


284
00:23:31.690 --> 00:23:33.490
Have you got a minute?

285
00:23:33.690 --> 00:23:35.590
Sure.

286
00:23:35.790 --> 00:23:39.090
Are any of these yours?

287
00:23:39.290 --> 00:23:41.090
Ouch.

288
00:23:41.390 --> 00:23:43.290
What?

289
00:23:43.490 --> 00:23:45.790
Well, these are bad, so-

290
00:23:45.990 --> 00:23:49.590
- Oh.

291
00:23:51.590 --> 00:23:55.490
Do you know that Tristan Reveur quote
about bad art?


292
00:23:55.690 --> 00:23:59.790
lt's ''Bad art is more tragically
beautiful than good art...


293
00:24:00.090 --> 00:24:02.490
because it documents
human failure.''


294
00:24:07.390 --> 00:24:09.690
Why'd do you want
to do it on Saturday?


295
00:24:11.590 --> 00:24:13.390
lt's my 21st birthday.

296
00:24:13.590 --> 00:24:16.990
l think the tradition
is to go out and get drunk.


297
00:24:17.290 --> 00:24:20.590
Well, um, Tristan started
a different tradition.


298
00:24:20.890 --> 00:24:22.690
What did he do?

299
00:24:24.190 --> 00:24:26.090
He died.

300
00:24:26.190 --> 00:24:28.290
What about your parents?

301
00:24:32.790 --> 00:24:35.290
What about 'em?

302
00:24:35.490 --> 00:24:37.790
Don't you think they care?

303
00:24:44.490 --> 00:24:45.990
No.

304
00:24:46.190 --> 00:24:48.490
Do they live around here?

305
00:24:50.190 --> 00:24:52.290
They're over in Mahlus Gardens.

306
00:24:52.490 --> 00:24:54.790
Mahlus Gardens-
Where is that?


307
00:24:54.990 --> 00:24:57.490
lt's a cemetery in Jersey.

308
00:25:00.890 --> 00:25:04.490
- l thought you read the file.
- l'm sorry.


309
00:25:04.690 --> 00:25:06.490
l did.
lt didn't mention that.


310
00:25:06.690 --> 00:25:09.490
lt's a little out of date.

311
00:25:09.690 --> 00:25:11.490
Do you have any other family?

312
00:25:11.690 --> 00:25:13.490
No.

313
00:25:13.690 --> 00:25:15.690
Girlfriend?

314
00:25:19.090 --> 00:25:21.290
You talked to her?

315
00:25:22.890 --> 00:25:24.790
No.

316
00:25:25.890 --> 00:25:27.690
Who is she?

317
00:25:33.190 --> 00:25:35.790
No, you're not talking to her.

318
00:25:38.490 --> 00:25:40.690
l thought you were talking
about this waitress...


319
00:25:40.890 --> 00:25:43.390
in this diner l used to go to
over on Canal Street.


320
00:25:43.590 --> 00:25:45.390
Tell me about her.

321
00:25:45.590 --> 00:25:49.990
When she filled up my cup of coffee,
she would ask me how l was doing.


322
00:25:50.290 --> 00:25:53.590
Waitress things, you know.
lt doesn't really constitute a girlfriend.


323
00:25:53.790 --> 00:25:56.390
Did you ever get her name?

324
00:25:56.590 --> 00:25:58.390
Yeah, it was Athena.

325
00:25:58.590 --> 00:26:00.890
l was gonna marry her.

326
00:26:02.890 --> 00:26:04.990
You were gonna marry her?

327
00:26:06.390 --> 00:26:08.690
Yeah. l bought her
a ring and everything.


328
00:26:12.890 --> 00:26:16.190
lt looked just like the one
that you got your girl.


329
00:26:21.390 --> 00:26:25.790
l didn't steal your ring,
Henry, okay? l promise.


330
00:26:32.590 --> 00:26:34.490
Yeah, l lost it.

331
00:26:36.790 --> 00:26:39.490
Anyway, she's gone.

332
00:26:39.690 --> 00:26:42.490
- She's gone?
- Yeah.


333
00:26:42.690 --> 00:26:44.990
- Or she's somewhere else?
- What do you mean?


334
00:26:45.190 --> 00:26:47.490
There is no somewhere else.

335
00:27:10.990 --> 00:27:12.790
He's not going to make it.

336
00:27:35.790 --> 00:27:38.390
- lt's beautiful.
- No.


337
00:27:38.590 --> 00:27:41.790
lt's like the crap
tourists buy on Fifth Avenue.


338
00:27:46.790 --> 00:27:50.490
- You talk with your student today?
- Mm-hmm.


339
00:27:52.490 --> 00:27:54.590
Still wants to do it?

340
00:27:54.790 --> 00:27:57.090
l don't feel right talking about it.

341
00:27:58.490 --> 00:28:00.690
Talking about it with me, you mean.

342
00:28:09.290 --> 00:28:11.590
You stopped taking your pills.

343
00:28:14.290 --> 00:28:16.890
l've been counting.
You haven't taken one in weeks.


344
00:28:17.090 --> 00:28:18.990
l don't need 'em anymore.

345
00:28:19.190 --> 00:28:21.990
Well, that's a decision
we should've made together.


346
00:28:22.190 --> 00:28:26.690
l can't paint on meds.

347
00:28:29.990 --> 00:28:31.990
l can't.

348
00:28:36.190 --> 00:28:39.090
- Well, it makes me nervous.

349
00:28:39.190 --> 00:28:41.990
l'm not happy
you did this in secret.


350
00:28:42.190 --> 00:28:46.790
Well, l'm not happy
you're counting my pills in secret.


351
00:28:47.090 --> 00:28:50.490
We have to trust each other.

352
00:28:56.290 --> 00:28:59.190
Hey, look at me.

353
00:29:04.190 --> 00:29:06.690
l can't make them disappear.

354
00:29:09.090 --> 00:29:10.990
l wish l could.

355
00:29:16.290 --> 00:29:18.490
l made you a promise.

356
00:29:20.190 --> 00:29:23.890
l gotta go.

357
00:29:26.990 --> 00:29:28.790
l'll see you at home.

358
00:29:31.690 --> 00:29:36.590
Henry?
Forgetting something?


359
00:29:39.590 --> 00:29:43.090
- What's the matter?
- You just called me Henry.


360
00:29:43.290 --> 00:29:47.690
- Baby, l think l know your name by now.
- Yeah, but you called me Henry.


361
00:29:47.990 --> 00:29:51.590
Sam, l know who you are.
l promise.


362
00:29:53.190 --> 00:29:54.990
Sorry.

363
00:29:58.490 --> 00:30:00.290
Okay.

364
00:30:15.990 --> 00:30:16.090
Do you get nervous?

365
00:30:16.090 --> 00:30:17.790
Do you get nervous?

366
00:30:17.890 --> 00:30:20.290
lt's a great part,
but she should resist more.


367
00:30:20.490 --> 00:30:23.890
- She just takes his abuse and walks into the river.
- You should use that.


368
00:30:24.190 --> 00:30:26.390
- All without a fight.
- Can we come and see you?


369
00:30:26.590 --> 00:30:28.590
- Henry, that would be nice, wouldn't it?
- Yeah, Mom.


370
00:30:28.790 --> 00:30:29.690
We could all go together.

371
00:30:29.690 --> 00:30:30.590
We could all go together.

372
00:30:33.690 --> 00:30:37.490
King's rook to E-3.

373
00:30:39.490 --> 00:30:41.290
Mm-hmm.

374
00:30:41.490 --> 00:30:43.990
How's Lila?

375
00:30:44.190 --> 00:30:47.790
She's good. Oh,
l got something for her.


376
00:30:48.090 --> 00:30:50.490
- Mm-hmm.
- Give me your hand.


377
00:30:52.590 --> 00:30:55.290
Ah.

378
00:30:55.490 --> 00:30:57.390
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.


379
00:30:57.590 --> 00:30:59.890
l hear she's a beautiful girl.

380
00:31:00.090 --> 00:31:03.590
How long have you
been carrying that around?


381
00:31:03.890 --> 00:31:05.390
A while.

382
00:31:05.590 --> 00:31:07.690
What are you waiting for?

383
00:31:07.890 --> 00:31:10.690
The fear to go away, l guess.

384
00:31:10.890 --> 00:31:13.090
Mm.

385
00:31:13.290 --> 00:31:15.790
How do l know she won't try again?

386
00:31:15.990 --> 00:31:17.890
You don't know, Sam.

387
00:31:17.990 --> 00:31:19.990
Does she make you happy?

388
00:31:20.190 --> 00:31:22.290
Oh, yes.

389
00:31:22.490 --> 00:31:25.090
Well, here's something that won't.

390
00:31:25.290 --> 00:31:27.990
Knight to C-3.
Check.


391
00:31:28.090 --> 00:31:30.090
- Oh, shit.

392
00:31:32.490 --> 00:31:37.190
Do you remember the dream
of the burning boy referred to by Freud?


393
00:31:37.490 --> 00:31:39.990
- Vaguely.
- Vaguely meaning no?


394
00:31:40.290 --> 00:31:42.090
- Right.
- Yeah.


395
00:31:42.290 --> 00:31:45.090
Well, he describes a man
whose child is dying.


396
00:31:45.290 --> 00:31:48.790
The father sits by the boy's bed
night after night...


397
00:31:49.090 --> 00:31:52.390
and after the boy is dead,
they give him a wake.


398
00:31:52.690 --> 00:31:57.690
And they set up a circle of candles
around the boy's body.


399
00:31:57.990 --> 00:32:01.290
And the father's exhausted.
He falls asleep.


400
00:32:01.590 --> 00:32:05.290
And he dreams that his son
is standing beside him...


401
00:32:05.490 --> 00:32:09.290
holding his arm
and whispering...


402
00:32:09.590 --> 00:32:12.090
''Father, can't you see
that l'm burning?''


403
00:32:12.290 --> 00:32:14.990
- You have a visitor?
- Henry.


404
00:32:15.290 --> 00:32:17.190
- l can come back.
- No, no. You're all right.


405
00:32:17.390 --> 00:32:19.290
- l don't mind.
- Do you know Dr. Patterson?


406
00:32:19.490 --> 00:32:22.390
- No.
- Pleased to meet you.


407
00:32:28.390 --> 00:32:31.290
What's the matter, Henry?

408
00:32:35.190 --> 00:32:37.090
What the fuck?

409
00:32:39.190 --> 00:32:41.390
What are you doing here?

410
00:32:41.490 --> 00:32:44.090
We're playing chess.

411
00:32:44.290 --> 00:32:46.390
You're dead.

412
00:32:46.590 --> 00:32:50.390
- Sam?
- l watched you die.


413
00:32:50.590 --> 00:32:53.090
Sam, we'll finish this game later.

414
00:32:53.290 --> 00:32:54.990
Sure.

415
00:32:55.190 --> 00:32:58.790
- Where are you going?
- Henry, take a seat.


416
00:32:58.990 --> 00:33:02.290
- Why'd you come back?
- Do you know Leon?


417
00:33:02.590 --> 00:33:05.390
What did he say to you?
Did he say something about me?


418
00:33:05.490 --> 00:33:08.490
No, he didn't say anything about you.
l don't think Leon even knows you.


419
00:33:10.290 --> 00:33:13.290
That's my father.

420
00:33:13.490 --> 00:33:15.390
He knows me.

421
00:33:15.590 --> 00:33:18.490
Now, listen, l've known Leon a long time.
He doesn't have any children.


422
00:33:18.690 --> 00:33:21.690
Don't say that! Don't
fuckin' say that to me!


423
00:33:21.990 --> 00:33:24.990
What are you doing?

424
00:33:25.290 --> 00:33:27.590
Do you think l don't
recognize my own father?


425
00:33:27.790 --> 00:33:30.690
- You told me your father was dead.
- He is dead.


426
00:33:30.790 --> 00:33:34.090
He's dead, and that's him
walkin' out the fuckin' door!


427
00:33:34.390 --> 00:33:36.890
The man walking out the door
is alive and well.


428
00:33:37.090 --> 00:33:39.990
What's happening?

429
00:33:40.190 --> 00:33:43.290
l saw all the blood,
and l watched him die.


430
00:33:45.490 --> 00:33:47.290
l did it.

431
00:33:47.490 --> 00:33:50.890
lt's my fault.

432
00:33:51.190 --> 00:33:53.890
Maybe you hurt someone,
but not Leon.


433
00:33:53.990 --> 00:33:56.590
Who did you hurt?
Your father?


434
00:33:56.790 --> 00:34:01.290
l don't remember.

435
00:34:01.590 --> 00:34:05.790
Sometimes we don't want to remember,
but l think you have to try.


436
00:34:07.190 --> 00:34:09.790
Fuck you! What the fuck
do you know!


437
00:34:09.990 --> 00:34:13.790
You don't know anything!
Everything you know is a fuckin' lie!


438
00:34:14.090 --> 00:34:16.890
- All right?
- Okay.


439
00:34:17.090 --> 00:34:19.690
Tell me what the truth is.

440
00:34:25.090 --> 00:34:28.390
Your troubles will cease,
and fortune will smile upon you.


441
00:34:32.990 --> 00:34:36.090
Your troubles will cease,
and fortune will smile upon you.


442
00:34:36.290 --> 00:34:38.290
Yes, Henry.

443
00:34:38.490 --> 00:34:41.290
Henry?

444
00:34:45.390 --> 00:34:46.690
Henry?

445
00:34:48.390 --> 00:34:50.690
Henry!

446
00:34:55.290 --> 00:34:57.990
Henry!

447
00:35:00.190 --> 00:35:02.290
Henry?

448
00:35:02.490 --> 00:35:04.690
Henry, are you there?

449
00:35:21.790 --> 00:35:24.190
Here we go.

450
00:35:56.190 --> 00:35:58.190
Trouble.

451
00:36:23.190 --> 00:36:25.590
- Henry, listen.

452
00:36:25.690 --> 00:36:28.190
Stay with me, okay?
Listen to my voice, Henry.


453
00:36:28.390 --> 00:36:31.990
- Stay with us here, all right?
- ls that your voice?


454
00:36:34.790 --> 00:36:37.590
l didn't leave that message.

455
00:36:37.790 --> 00:36:40.990
Probably someone who
sounds exactly like you.


456
00:36:41.190 --> 00:36:43.290
So what do we do now?

457
00:36:43.490 --> 00:36:45.290
Not much we can do
at this point.


458
00:36:45.590 --> 00:36:49.390
We don't have the resources or the manpower
for a stakeout or anything like that.


459
00:36:49.690 --> 00:36:52.090
l'll notify the police,
but they won't do anything.


460
00:36:52.190 --> 00:36:54.090
Why not?

461
00:36:54.190 --> 00:36:57.990
Because they've got more important things
to do than look for depressed college students.


462
00:36:58.190 --> 00:36:59.890
Then l'll find him.

463
00:36:59.990 --> 00:37:01.890
Well, if you do,
give me a call.


464
00:37:02.090 --> 00:37:04.490
We'll pick him up for you.
But do me a favor, Sammy.


465
00:37:04.690 --> 00:37:07.290
The kid hears voices
and carries a gun.


466
00:37:07.490 --> 00:37:09.190
Watch your back.

467
00:37:16.790 --> 00:37:19.890
Mommy, is that man
gonna die?


468
00:37:22.890 --> 00:37:24.990
Come on, Bobby.
We're gonna be late.


469
00:37:25.190 --> 00:37:27.990
You shouldn't run away from me like that,
you little monkey.


470
00:37:28.290 --> 00:37:30.190
But is he gonna die?

471
00:37:35.090 --> 00:37:36.990
Listen to this.

472
00:37:37.090 --> 00:37:39.890
''Henry Letham has a fertile,
powerful imagination.


473
00:37:40.090 --> 00:37:44.390
lf he maintains his concentration,
he will create new worlds with his art.''


474
00:37:44.690 --> 00:37:47.390
Jim O'Shea?

475
00:37:47.590 --> 00:37:49.590
Professor O'Shea, yeah.
How'd you know?


476
00:37:49.790 --> 00:37:53.290
'CauseJim wants to fuck
every cute boy in his class.


477
00:37:53.590 --> 00:37:57.590
- Did you ever hear of an artist
named Tristan Reveur?
- Yeah, of course.


478
00:37:57.890 --> 00:38:00.490
- Do you like his work?
- l've never seen it. Nobody has.


479
00:38:00.690 --> 00:38:03.090
He burned all his paintings
before he killed himself.


480
00:38:03.290 --> 00:38:05.090
- He killed himself?
- Mm-hmm.


481
00:38:05.290 --> 00:38:07.790
When he was 18, he told everyone
he'd live three more years...


482
00:38:07.990 --> 00:38:09.990
then go to New York
and kill himself.


483
00:38:10.190 --> 00:38:13.990
And that's exactly what he did.
Left a one-line note:


484
00:38:14.190 --> 00:38:18.490
''Un suicide elegant
est l'oeuvre d'art finale.''


485
00:38:18.790 --> 00:38:21.490
''An elegant suicide is
the ultimate work of art.''


486
00:38:21.690 --> 00:38:24.890
Ah,Jesus.
He's Henry's favorite artist.


487
00:38:25.190 --> 00:38:27.090
Of course he is.

488
00:38:32.790 --> 00:38:34.690
Let me talk to him.

489
00:38:34.790 --> 00:38:36.990
Talk to him?
First l've gotta find him.


490
00:38:37.190 --> 00:38:40.990
He'll find you. He knows you can help him.
That's exactly why he keeps coming back to you.


491
00:38:41.290 --> 00:38:43.690
Well, even if he does,
l can't let you talk to him.


492
00:38:43.990 --> 00:38:45.890
l'd violate every rule in the book.

493
00:38:45.990 --> 00:38:50.890
So violate them. You have something, Sam.
This kid trusts you.


494
00:38:51.290 --> 00:38:54.790
But you've never stood where
he's standing right now, and he knows that.


495
00:38:55.090 --> 00:38:59.490
Yeah, but l treat people every day
with conditions l've never experienced myself.


496
00:39:02.790 --> 00:39:05.390
You know, the day l did it...

497
00:39:05.590 --> 00:39:08.790
l took two razor blades
to the bathtub.


498
00:39:09.090 --> 00:39:12.190
You know why?

499
00:39:12.390 --> 00:39:16.690
Because l knew that
once l started to bleed, l'd get weak...


500
00:39:16.990 --> 00:39:21.290
and l didn't want to drop one blade
and leave myself half done.


501
00:39:23.390 --> 00:39:25.590
Can you imagine that?

502
00:39:25.790 --> 00:39:28.690
Can you imagine hating
your life so much...


503
00:39:28.890 --> 00:39:31.590
that you want to bring
a backup razor?


504
00:39:46.490 --> 00:39:48.390
So what do l tell him?

505
00:39:52.090 --> 00:39:54.890
There's too much beauty to quit.

506
00:39:56.890 --> 00:40:01.190
Tell him that.
There's too much goddamn beauty.


507
00:40:14.190 --> 00:40:15.990
Eat something.

508
00:40:16.190 --> 00:40:18.890
l'm not hungry.

509
00:40:19.190 --> 00:40:21.990
Eat your fortune cookie.

510
00:40:25.890 --> 00:40:28.090
lt's yours.

511
00:40:37.190 --> 00:40:41.890
''Your troubles will cease,
and fortune will smile upon you.''


512
00:40:42.290 --> 00:40:44.790
Not a moment too soon.

513
00:40:46.990 --> 00:40:48.890
What's the matter?

514
00:41:04.790 --> 00:41:07.690
- Beth, it's Sam.
-  l didn't touch him.


515
00:41:07.790 --> 00:41:10.590
- Beth? Beth?
- l know you're not supposed to move-


516
00:41:24.990 --> 00:41:27.790
Beth?

517
00:41:29.390 --> 00:41:31.390
Beth?

518
00:41:31.590 --> 00:41:33.490
lt's me.

519
00:41:33.690 --> 00:41:36.690
Are you okay?

520
00:41:39.590 --> 00:41:41.690
l'm gonna turn on the light, okay?

521
00:41:49.190 --> 00:41:52.890
l know Leon's been trying
to get through to you.


522
00:41:53.190 --> 00:41:54.990
And Toni.

523
00:41:59.490 --> 00:42:02.090
Oh,Jesus.

524
00:42:04.390 --> 00:42:08.390
- Beth, are you gonna talk to me?

525
00:42:08.590 --> 00:42:11.190
What do you want to talk about?

526
00:42:13.690 --> 00:42:15.590
How are you feeling?

527
00:42:15.790 --> 00:42:19.190
What do you really
wanna talk about?


528
00:42:20.890 --> 00:42:23.490
l'm worried about you...

529
00:42:23.690 --> 00:42:26.690
and l wanna know more
about Henry Letham.


530
00:42:27.090 --> 00:42:29.090
l didn't touch him.

531
00:42:29.290 --> 00:42:32.190
l know you're not
supposed to move them.


532
00:42:32.390 --> 00:42:34.090
What does that mean?

533
00:42:34.190 --> 00:42:35.090
What does that mean?

534
00:42:37.690 --> 00:42:40.690
l wanna kiss you.
Do you want to play a kissing game?


535
00:42:40.990 --> 00:42:42.290
Beth.

536
00:42:44.390 --> 00:42:47.090
No. You're loyal.

537
00:42:47.290 --> 00:42:51.490
You're a good dog.
Good, loyal dog, Sam.


538
00:42:53.190 --> 00:42:55.090
What's her name?

539
00:42:55.190 --> 00:42:56.990
Lila?

540
00:42:57.290 --> 00:43:00.290
You should've let her
bleed in the bathtub.


541
00:43:00.590 --> 00:43:03.790
- She had the right idea.
- What are you talking about?


542
00:43:03.990 --> 00:43:06.990
lt's highly inappropriate.

543
00:43:07.190 --> 00:43:11.090
You're not supposed to fuck your patients,
even the pretty ones.


544
00:43:11.390 --> 00:43:13.290
You know the rules.

545
00:43:13.490 --> 00:43:17.590
- You can't drink while you're taking these.
- Mm. Apparently l can.


546
00:43:17.790 --> 00:43:21.090
No, you can't. Come on, Beth.
l want you to come take a shower.


547
00:43:22.590 --> 00:43:24.190
Bathe the corpse.

548
00:43:24.290 --> 00:43:26.590
We won't really be corpses
though, will we?


549
00:43:26.790 --> 00:43:29.190
lt will be more
like a memory of nothing.


550
00:43:29.390 --> 00:43:31.690
What happened to you, Beth?

551
00:43:31.990 --> 00:43:36.090
- l need to sleep, please.
- No, you got too much crap in your system.


552
00:43:36.390 --> 00:43:38.390
Are you okay to shower?

553
00:43:38.490 --> 00:43:41.490
- He's watching us.
- No, we're alone.


554
00:43:41.690 --> 00:43:45.390
- He's watching.
- Are you still talking to him?


555
00:43:45.790 --> 00:43:48.190
- Do you know where he is?
- Ask the mother.


556
00:43:48.490 --> 00:43:51.290
- The mother's dead.
- ls she?


557
00:43:51.490 --> 00:43:53.290
Ask anyway.

558
00:43:53.490 --> 00:43:55.390
Hello? Hello? Yeah.

559
00:43:55.690 --> 00:43:57.790
This is Sam Foster,
Dr. Sam Foster.


560
00:43:57.990 --> 00:44:01.390
l'm a psychiatrist. Yeah.

561
00:44:01.690 --> 00:44:05.090
l'm calling about a student
named Henry Letham.


562
00:44:06.990 --> 00:44:09.090
He is?

563
00:44:09.290 --> 00:44:11.590
This is very strange, Mrs. Letham.

564
00:44:11.790 --> 00:44:15.790
He told me you had passed-
Hello? Hello?


565
00:44:15.990 --> 00:44:17.990
- Damn it.

566
00:44:21.690 --> 00:44:24.390
This is it.
l won't be long.


567
00:44:42.290 --> 00:44:45.890
- l've been waiting for you.

568
00:44:46.290 --> 00:44:48.090
Mrs. Letham?

569
00:44:48.290 --> 00:44:51.890
l'm Dr. Sam Foster.
l'm sorry to bother you at this hour.


570
00:44:52.090 --> 00:44:54.290
l thought you'd never come.

571
00:44:54.490 --> 00:44:58.390
l would have come earlier.
l didn't know you were here.


572
00:44:58.690 --> 00:45:01.790
lt's easy to forget about me...

573
00:45:01.990 --> 00:45:03.990
all alone up here.

574
00:45:04.190 --> 00:45:07.390
Your son's not well.
That's why l'm here.


575
00:45:07.690 --> 00:45:09.490
l'm trying to find him.

576
00:45:09.590 --> 00:45:12.990
l'm sorry to say he's threatened
to commit suicide.


577
00:45:13.290 --> 00:45:17.490
You came to see Olive,
didn't you? Not me.


578
00:45:17.690 --> 00:45:19.690
Olive?

579
00:45:19.990 --> 00:45:23.890
There she is.
She's been lonely.


580
00:45:24.090 --> 00:45:26.890
Me and Olive
keep each other company.


581
00:45:27.190 --> 00:45:30.690
We've been alone in this house
for a thousand years.


582
00:45:32.990 --> 00:45:35.390
Hey, Olive.

583
00:45:35.590 --> 00:45:37.890
How are you doing, girl?

584
00:45:38.090 --> 00:45:40.690
She doesn't remember you.

585
00:45:43.190 --> 00:45:46.690
- Are you hungry?
- No.


586
00:45:46.990 --> 00:45:49.090
Do you know
how to contact your son?


587
00:45:49.290 --> 00:45:51.790
Are there any relatives or friends
he might have gone to see?


588
00:45:54.590 --> 00:45:56.590
Let me fix you something to eat.

589
00:45:56.790 --> 00:46:00.290
You stay with Olive.
There's some leftovers in the fridge.


590
00:46:02.890 --> 00:46:05.890
Most days l don't say
a single word.


591
00:46:06.190 --> 00:46:09.890
Sometimes l'm silent so long,
l forget how to speak.


592
00:46:15.290 --> 00:46:18.290
Mrs. Letham,
we have an emergency here.


593
00:46:18.690 --> 00:46:20.490
You-

594
00:46:20.590 --> 00:46:23.290
Do you hate me?

595
00:46:24.990 --> 00:46:26.890
You must hate me.

596
00:46:28.390 --> 00:46:30.490
ls that why you did it?

597
00:46:30.690 --> 00:46:32.790
No, l don't hate you.

598
00:46:34.290 --> 00:46:36.990
l'm here because
your son needs help.


599
00:46:38.390 --> 00:46:41.190
l knew you'd come eventually.

600
00:46:41.390 --> 00:46:44.790
lt's been quiet without you.
Lonely.


601
00:46:45.090 --> 00:46:49.190
Mrs. Letham, who do you think l am?

602
00:46:49.490 --> 00:46:52.690
Don't play games.
Not anymore.


603
00:46:52.890 --> 00:46:54.890
Who am l?

604
00:46:55.090 --> 00:46:57.790
You think l don't
know you, Henry?


605
00:46:57.890 --> 00:47:00.890
You think l don't
recognize my only son?


606
00:47:01.090 --> 00:47:05.390
Oh, Lord, l've missed you.
l've missed you so much.


607
00:47:06.890 --> 00:47:09.690
l know you never
meant to hurt us.


608
00:47:09.990 --> 00:47:13.190
- Mom?
- Yes, baby.


609
00:47:13.390 --> 00:47:15.790
How did l hurt you?

610
00:47:15.990 --> 00:47:20.290
lt doesn't matter anymore.
l could never stay angry with you.


611
00:47:22.590 --> 00:47:24.390
What do l do on Saturdays?

612
00:47:26.890 --> 00:47:31.190
When you were a boy,
you used to go to the zoo.


613
00:47:31.390 --> 00:47:36.590
Remember? You loved
to watch the walrus swim.


614
00:47:36.990 --> 00:47:39.290
But l'm older now.

615
00:47:39.490 --> 00:47:43.490
lt's my 21st birthday tomorrow.
What'll l do for my birthday?


616
00:47:45.290 --> 00:47:49.990
Who knows?
You don't tell me anything these days.


617
00:47:50.290 --> 00:47:53.190
l guess you tell Athena
your secrets now.


618
00:47:53.390 --> 00:47:57.190
Athena?
Do you remember where Athena lives?


619
00:47:57.390 --> 00:47:59.590
Dogs are a big responsibility, darling.

620
00:47:59.790 --> 00:48:02.890
- Look at the mess l'm making.

621
00:48:03.090 --> 00:48:05.790
- l just have to clean it up.
- Let me see your head.


622
00:48:06.090 --> 00:48:07.990
- You don't want to see.
- Mrs. Letham.


623
00:48:08.090 --> 00:48:10.690
You didn't mean to hurt anyone.
You know you didn't.


624
00:48:10.990 --> 00:48:13.390
Let me look at your head.
That's a serious wound.


625
00:48:13.590 --> 00:48:17.090
- Don't look at me, darling. Don't-

626
00:48:17.290 --> 00:48:19.390
- Olive, off!.

627
00:48:19.690 --> 00:48:22.990
- Olive, off!.

628
00:48:23.290 --> 00:48:25.290
Let me fix you something to eat.

629
00:48:27.690 --> 00:48:30.390
You're a bleeder, huh?

630
00:48:30.690 --> 00:48:32.890
Here, maintain pressure on that.

631
00:48:35.390 --> 00:48:39.190
Dr. Foster?
Could l have a word with you?


632
00:48:42.590 --> 00:48:44.990
Yeah,you got bit up pretty good.

633
00:48:45.190 --> 00:48:48.290
- Get your rabies shot already?
- Yeah.


634
00:48:50.090 --> 00:48:54.590
Look, l'm, uh-
l'm Sheriff Kennelly.


635
00:48:54.890 --> 00:48:57.990
Now, l-l know you already
spoke with Deputy Carlyle...


636
00:48:58.190 --> 00:49:01.790
but l just wanted
to confirm a few things.


637
00:49:02.090 --> 00:49:06.790
You said the, uh- the assault took place
at 9625 Rickover Street?


638
00:49:07.090 --> 00:49:09.890
- That's right.
- The home belonging to the Letham family?


639
00:49:10.090 --> 00:49:13.490
Right. Her dog attacked me,
and... she needs some help.


640
00:49:13.790 --> 00:49:16.190
She has a severe head wound.
She should be in a hospital.


641
00:49:16.390 --> 00:49:18.490
l went to high school
with Maureen Letham.


642
00:49:18.690 --> 00:49:21.890
Oh, yeah? Maybe you know her son, Henry.
He's a patient of mine.


643
00:49:22.190 --> 00:49:25.490
l remember Henry.
Pale, skinny kid, always drawing pictures.


644
00:49:25.690 --> 00:49:28.690
- Yeah, that's him.
- He kind of gave me the creeps.


645
00:49:28.990 --> 00:49:31.390
What's strange, Doctor-

646
00:49:31.590 --> 00:49:33.890
What l'm trying to figure out is...

647
00:49:34.090 --> 00:49:37.690
who you were speaking with
over there at 9625 Rickover Street.


648
00:49:37.890 --> 00:49:40.890
l'm sorry. l thought we already
established Maureen Letham.


649
00:49:41.190 --> 00:49:43.790
She told you her name
was Maureen Letham?


650
00:49:43.990 --> 00:49:45.890
Yeah. We were talking
about her son.


651
00:49:46.190 --> 00:49:48.490
She wasn't entirely coherent.
She needs medical assistance.


652
00:49:48.690 --> 00:49:51.390
But why did you want to talk
to this woman at 1:00 in the morning?


653
00:49:51.590 --> 00:49:54.090
Look, l'm treating her son.
lt's an emergency situation.


654
00:49:54.290 --> 00:49:57.490
The- Sheriff, she needs help.
She's lost a lot of blood.


655
00:49:58.990 --> 00:50:02.390
l told you l went to school
with Maureen Letham.


656
00:50:02.590 --> 00:50:05.090
l also went to her funeral.

657
00:50:05.290 --> 00:50:08.190
She's been dead for months.

658
00:50:08.490 --> 00:50:10.890
Car wreck-
her and her husband.


659
00:50:11.090 --> 00:50:14.790
As far as l know, that house is empty still.
The family's trying to sell it.


660
00:50:14.990 --> 00:50:17.990
l spoke to Maureen Letham
an hour ago.


661
00:50:18.290 --> 00:50:21.590
lt's probably just
someone's confused.


662
00:50:23.790 --> 00:50:25.690
So how long they keeping you here?

663
00:50:25.990 --> 00:50:29.690
l don't know. l gotta head back into the city.
Look, 9625 Rickover Street.


664
00:50:29.990 --> 00:50:32.890
l was there.
Henry's mother was there.


665
00:50:33.090 --> 00:50:35.490
All right, Dr. Foster.

666
00:50:35.690 --> 00:50:38.290
We'll be in touch.
l've got your number.


667
00:50:43.390 --> 00:50:45.790
Sheriff?

668
00:50:48.290 --> 00:50:50.290
Sheriff?

669
00:50:50.490 --> 00:50:52.790
- Uh-huh.
- Mrs. Letham-


670
00:50:52.990 --> 00:50:54.890
Did she have brown eyes?

671
00:50:55.090 --> 00:50:58.490
Oh, no, sir.
Bluest eyes in town.


672
00:51:42.090 --> 00:51:47.090
No, no, no, no, no.

673
00:53:23.790 --> 00:53:27.590
- Doing good. Up slow,Jerry.
- Mommy, hurry up!


674
00:53:27.790 --> 00:53:30.090
- l got it.
- Not so fast.


675
00:53:30.290 --> 00:53:31.990
- Stop that sway. Easy.
- Come on, Mommy. Faster.


676
00:53:32.090 --> 00:53:32.690
- Stop that sway. Easy.
- Come on, Mommy. Faster.


677
00:53:32.790 --> 00:53:35.990
- Hold it. Stay clear, you guys.
- Oh! Wait. Wait!


678
00:53:36.290 --> 00:53:38.890
My balloon!

679
00:53:39.090 --> 00:53:40.990
Sorry, kid.
lt's gone to balloon heaven.


680
00:53:41.190 --> 00:53:43.990
That's okay, sir. We're gonna
get another one at the park.


681
00:53:44.190 --> 00:53:45.990
- Go ahead, honey.
- Promise, Mommy?


682
00:53:46.190 --> 00:53:49.190
Comin'at you, guys.
Comin'your way.


683
00:53:49.390 --> 00:53:52.990
You were here on Thursday, right?
You were moving the piano on Thursday too, right?


684
00:53:53.290 --> 00:53:55.690
-Can l help you with something?
-Yeah, the kid and the balloon-


685
00:53:55.890 --> 00:53:58.890
- The same thing happened on Thursday, right?
- We're a little busy here.


686
00:53:59.190 --> 00:54:00.990
Why don't you go bother
someone else, huh?


687
00:54:01.290 --> 00:54:05.190
Your way, guys! There you go.
Watch that thing. That's it.


688
00:54:10.190 --> 00:54:12.090
Christ!
Where have you been?


689
00:54:15.190 --> 00:54:17.190
What happened to you?

690
00:54:17.390 --> 00:54:20.590
l've been calling people all over the city,
looking for you.


691
00:54:20.790 --> 00:54:24.890
- l was about to call the police.
What happened to you?


692
00:54:25.190 --> 00:54:28.490
l've been calling people all over the city,
looking for you.


693
00:54:28.590 --> 00:54:30.890
Christ!
Where have you been?


694
00:54:31.090 --> 00:54:33.390
l've been calling people all over the city,
looking for you.


695
00:54:33.590 --> 00:54:36.690
l was about to call the police.
What's going on, Sam?


696
00:54:36.990 --> 00:54:39.890
- l don't know.
- No, you've gotta talk to me. l've been up all night.


697
00:54:40.090 --> 00:54:41.890
- What happened to your arm?
- Dog bite.


698
00:54:42.190 --> 00:54:44.290
- Dog bite?
- Yeah, l had the shots and the painkillers.


699
00:54:44.490 --> 00:54:47.090
- What dog? Where?
- Look, l'm seeing things
that don't make any sense...


700
00:54:47.290 --> 00:54:49.390
and l'm meeting people that
are supposed to be dead...


701
00:54:49.590 --> 00:54:51.390
and Beth's had
a nervous breakdown.


702
00:54:51.590 --> 00:54:54.390
The kid l'm treating knows
what's gonna happen before it happens.


703
00:54:54.590 --> 00:54:58.190
- Okay,just slow down.
- And l saw the same boy
lose the same balloon twice.


704
00:54:58.390 --> 00:55:01.090
- Baby, you're not making any sense.
- No, nothing makes any sense.


705
00:55:01.390 --> 00:55:03.590
- You're scaring me.
- Nothing makes any sense.


706
00:55:03.690 --> 00:55:06.790
Okay. You just need
to relax. Slow down.


707
00:55:06.990 --> 00:55:08.890
- Okay.
- Hey, you need to sleep.


708
00:55:09.090 --> 00:55:11.790
Yeah. No, l can't.

709
00:55:11.990 --> 00:55:14.290
- l gotta find him. l'm running out of time.
- No, no.


710
00:55:14.490 --> 00:55:16.890
-Just for a while. Lie down.
- You think?


711
00:55:17.090 --> 00:55:19.990
All right. All right.

712
00:55:20.190 --> 00:55:22.590
Maybe just for a little bit.

713
00:55:22.790 --> 00:55:25.490
- Okay.

714
00:55:25.790 --> 00:55:28.290
Maybe just a little bit.

715
00:56:15.690 --> 00:56:17.490
Jesus Christ.

716
00:56:21.590 --> 00:56:24.190
l've been looking all over for you.

717
00:56:25.990 --> 00:56:29.290
l want you to come uptown with me.
l want you to meet a friend of mine.


718
00:56:31.290 --> 00:56:33.190
l don't wanna go uptown.

719
00:56:37.890 --> 00:56:39.990
l met your mother last night.

720
00:56:41.690 --> 00:56:44.390
What do you mean,
you met my mother?


721
00:56:44.590 --> 00:56:46.790
You told me she was dead.

722
00:56:46.990 --> 00:56:48.990
She's okay?

723
00:56:49.190 --> 00:56:50.890
Yeah, everyone seems to think
your mother's dead...


724
00:56:51.090 --> 00:56:53.090
but l'm standing in a kitchen
talking to her.


725
00:56:53.290 --> 00:56:54.990
Sh
-She's gonna be okay?

726
00:56:55.190 --> 00:56:57.890
l don't know. She's sick.
She got hurt somehow. l don't know.


727
00:56:58.090 --> 00:57:00.290
ls she mad?

728
00:57:00.490 --> 00:57:02.890
- The dog seemed pretty fuckin' mad.
- What dog?


729
00:57:02.990 --> 00:57:06.790
- Olive.
- Olive?


730
00:57:07.090 --> 00:57:08.990
Yeah, we put Olive
to sleep when l was 12.


731
00:57:09.090 --> 00:57:10.890
She had a tumor in her liver.

732
00:57:11.190 --> 00:57:14.290
Well, Olive's not dead.
She is very much not dead.


733
00:57:14.490 --> 00:57:16.390
Yeah, she is.
But she was a good girl.


734
00:57:16.590 --> 00:57:19.190
Quit playing with me.
l wanna know what's going on.


735
00:57:19.390 --> 00:57:23.190
How do you know the future?
l wanna help you, but-


736
00:57:23.490 --> 00:57:25.190
- l need some fuckin' answers!
- What happened to your parents?


737
00:57:25.290 --> 00:57:26.690
- l need some fuckin' answers!
- What happened to your parents?


738
00:57:30.790 --> 00:57:35.390
Look, there are things that you have to tell me.
l mean, l mean...


739
00:57:35.690 --> 00:57:38.190
if you were just gonna
kill yourself, you'd have done it by now.


740
00:57:38.390 --> 00:57:41.290
So why haven't you?

741
00:57:41.490 --> 00:57:44.690
Why do you keep coming to me?

742
00:57:48.790 --> 00:57:51.090
'Cause you're the only one
that can help me.


743
00:57:53.990 --> 00:57:55.890
That's why.

744
00:58:06.190 --> 00:58:07.190
Henry? Henry?

745
00:58:07.290 --> 00:58:08.790
Henry? Henry?

746
00:58:08.890 --> 00:58:10.790
l've seen people go through
what you're going through.


747
00:58:12.690 --> 00:58:15.690
l've helped them come out
the other side.


748
00:58:15.890 --> 00:58:18.090
lf you work with me,
l can help you.


749
00:58:22.590 --> 00:58:25.190
The way you helped your girl?

750
00:58:26.790 --> 00:58:29.490
lt's Lila, right?

751
00:58:31.290 --> 00:58:34.890
l've seen the, uh,
scars on her wrists.


752
00:58:38.490 --> 00:58:40.890
Did you save her?

753
00:58:46.290 --> 00:58:48.090
She saved herself.

754
00:58:52.190 --> 00:58:54.690
Yeah, but you helped, right?

755
00:58:56.590 --> 00:59:00.990
No. Sometimes suicide is an attempt
for attention. With Lila it wasn't.


756
00:59:01.290 --> 00:59:04.290
She put three four-inch vertical slits
in each wrist.


757
00:59:04.490 --> 00:59:07.490
She split both sets of ulnar
and radial arteries.


758
00:59:07.790 --> 00:59:11.590
By the time l got to her,
she'd lost five pints of blood.


759
00:59:11.890 --> 00:59:15.090
l just pulled her out of the bathtub,
put tourniquets on both arms...


760
00:59:15.290 --> 00:59:18.090
and called an ambulance.

761
00:59:18.290 --> 00:59:20.490
Aren't you afraid
she's gonna do it again?


762
00:59:22.290 --> 00:59:24.390
No.

763
00:59:24.590 --> 00:59:26.390
Why?

764
00:59:28.290 --> 00:59:30.090
'Cause she loves me.

765
00:59:33.290 --> 00:59:37.690
lf she were here,
l know she'd say...


766
00:59:37.990 --> 00:59:40.390
to open your eyes a little wider.

767
00:59:43.190 --> 00:59:46.390
l know she'd tell you that
there's too much beauty to quit.


768
00:59:55.690 --> 00:59:58.090
She's probably right.

769
00:59:59.490 --> 01:00:03.290
Anyway... it's too late.

770
01:00:04.990 --> 01:00:06.890
Henry?

771
01:00:07.090 --> 01:00:08.890
l can't let you leave this time.

772
01:00:09.190 --> 01:00:11.390
You gotta stay with me.
l gotta take you uptown to meet this-


773
01:00:11.590 --> 01:00:13.490
- Get the fuck outta my way.
- No, you gotta come with me to the-


774
01:00:13.590 --> 01:00:16.490
- Get outta my way, all right? Move. Move.
- l can't.


775
01:00:16.790 --> 01:00:19.590
- l can't let you-
- Let me show you something.


776
01:00:24.990 --> 01:00:27.890
l killed my parents.

777
01:00:32.690 --> 01:00:34.690
l killed my mother and my father.

778
01:00:39.190 --> 01:00:41.090
l'm gonna go to hell.

779
01:00:44.390 --> 01:00:47.190
Or maybe l'm already there.
l don't know.


780
01:00:52.590 --> 01:00:54.390
l'm sorry, Sam.

781
01:00:59.790 --> 01:01:01.690
Don't follow me.

782
01:01:27.990 --> 01:01:29.990
Canal Street.
A diner.


783
01:01:30.190 --> 01:01:32.090
Canal Street. A diner. Yeah, which diner?
There's maybe 20.


784
01:01:32.290 --> 01:01:35.290
l don't know, pick one.
Keep the meter running.


785
01:01:49.990 --> 01:01:53.190
Excuse me.
Do you have an Athena working here?


786
01:01:53.390 --> 01:01:55.690
Yeah. Athena!

787
01:01:55.990 --> 01:01:58.190
- Yeah, what?
- Athena?


788
01:01:58.390 --> 01:02:00.990
What? What do you want?

789
01:02:01.190 --> 01:02:04.190
All right, next one.
All right, next one.


790
01:02:06.390 --> 01:02:08.190
All right, next one.

791
01:02:13.290 --> 01:02:15.190
All right.

792
01:02:15.390 --> 01:02:17.190
There's one more.

793
01:02:23.890 --> 01:02:26.490
We're running out of options here.
l really don't know what you want.


794
01:02:26.690 --> 01:02:29.190
All right.
Just try one more, please.


795
01:02:46.290 --> 01:02:49.190
Excuse me.
Do you have a waitress here named Athena?


796
01:02:49.390 --> 01:02:50.890
- Athena?
- Yeah.


797
01:02:50.990 --> 01:02:54.390
No, never heard of her.

798
01:02:55.790 --> 01:02:58.590
- Can l get a coffee, please?
- Sure.


799
01:03:13.690 --> 01:03:15.790
Planning on proposing to Athena?

800
01:03:18.490 --> 01:03:21.090
No. Do you know her?

801
01:03:21.290 --> 01:03:25.190
- Are we talking about the same girl?
- You a cop?


802
01:03:26.390 --> 01:03:28.790
No, l'm more of a matchmaker.

803
01:03:28.990 --> 01:03:32.390
Doesn't work here anymore.
But she's in my acting class.


804
01:03:33.790 --> 01:03:36.790
She is?
Could you tell me where she lives?


805
01:03:37.090 --> 01:03:38.790
What are you, her stalker?

806
01:03:38.890 --> 01:03:42.190
No. No.

807
01:03:42.490 --> 01:03:45.490
- l'm a psychiatrist.

808
01:03:45.690 --> 01:03:47.690
See?

809
01:03:47.890 --> 01:03:51.990
A psychiatrist, huh?
So you could write a Xanax prescription.


810
01:03:52.290 --> 01:03:54.890
l could write
a Xanax prescription...


811
01:03:55.090 --> 01:03:57.590
for one of my patients
who needed it, yeah.


812
01:03:57.790 --> 01:03:59.590
Okay.

813
01:03:59.890 --> 01:04:01.790
Good luck finding Athena.

814
01:04:05.290 --> 01:04:07.990
- Prison, my lord?
- Denmark's a prison.


815
01:04:08.190 --> 01:04:10.890
- Then is the world one?
- A goodly one...


816
01:04:11.190 --> 01:04:13.890
in which there are many confines,
wards and dungeons.


817
01:04:14.090 --> 01:04:16.590
Denmark being one of the worst.

818
01:04:16.790 --> 01:04:18.590
We think not so, my lord.

819
01:04:18.790 --> 01:04:21.590
Well, then 'tis none to you,
for there is nothing either good or bad...


820
01:04:21.690 --> 01:04:23.590
but thinking makes it so.

821
01:04:23.790 --> 01:04:26.290
To me, it is a prison.

822
01:04:26.490 --> 01:04:28.790
- Prison, my lord?
- Denmark's a prison.


823
01:04:28.890 --> 01:04:31.490
- We already had this conversation.
- Oh, um, uh, wait a minute.


824
01:04:31.690 --> 01:04:35.790
Uh, um-

825
01:04:35.990 --> 01:04:39.790
- ''Why then your ambition''-
- Why then your ambition makes it one.


826
01:04:39.990 --> 01:04:41.990
'Tis too narrow for your mind.

827
01:04:42.090 --> 01:04:43.990
l could be bounded
in a nutshell...


828
01:04:44.190 --> 01:04:46.490
and count myself
a king of infinite space...


829
01:04:46.690 --> 01:04:49.790
were it not
that l have bad dreams.


830
01:04:50.090 --> 01:04:53.990
- That's my favorite line in the whole play.
- lt's a good line.


831
01:04:54.190 --> 01:04:56.490
However, my favorite line
of the play is:


832
01:04:56.690 --> 01:05:00.390
''O what a rogue
and peasant slave am l.''


833
01:05:00.690 --> 01:05:04.390
l have no idea what any of it means,
but l love the word ''slave''.


834
01:05:04.690 --> 01:05:07.690
l love it. l gotta go.

835
01:05:07.890 --> 01:05:11.490
- l've got a solo in choir tomorrow morning.
- Thanks for reading with me.


836
01:05:11.690 --> 01:05:16.090
- You're a good Rosencrantz.
- l know. Bye.


837
01:05:18.990 --> 01:05:20.790
- Hello.
- Hi.


838
01:05:24.990 --> 01:05:28.390
l always pictured Hamlet as a man.

839
01:05:28.590 --> 01:05:31.390
That's a bit narrow-minded
of you, isn't it?


840
01:05:31.690 --> 01:05:34.690
This is the lesbian Hamlet.
All the parts are played by women.


841
01:05:34.890 --> 01:05:37.090
- Oh.
- l'm joking.


842
01:05:37.190 --> 01:05:40.690
l'm Ophelia.
l just get so sick of playing her.


843
01:05:40.990 --> 01:05:43.690
Things get tough,
she jumps in the drink.


844
01:05:43.990 --> 01:05:46.390
Hamlet hogs all the good lines.

845
01:05:46.590 --> 01:05:48.490
Well, he's notorious for that.

846
01:05:48.690 --> 01:05:50.890
We've met before, haven't we?

847
01:05:51.090 --> 01:05:54.190
No, l don't think so.
l'm Sam Foster.


848
01:05:54.390 --> 01:05:55.790
- Athena.
- Hi.


849
01:05:55.990 --> 01:05:58.490
Hi. Are you joining the class?

850
01:05:58.590 --> 01:06:01.090
No. l've been looking for you,
as a matter of fact.


851
01:06:01.290 --> 01:06:03.790
That's flattering. Why?

852
01:06:03.990 --> 01:06:08.090
l'm a psychiatrist,
and l have a patient who, uh...


853
01:06:08.390 --> 01:06:11.090
likes you very much.

854
01:06:11.290 --> 01:06:14.090
That's an unusual way
of trying to get a date.


855
01:06:15.690 --> 01:06:17.490
- What's his name?
- Henry Letham.


856
01:06:17.590 --> 01:06:20.190
- Sounds familiar.
- You served him coffee in a diner a couple of times.


857
01:06:20.490 --> 01:06:23.390
You were nice to him. But the way
he tells it, you're the one good thing...


858
01:06:23.490 --> 01:06:25.890
that ever happened to him.

859
01:06:26.090 --> 01:06:28.790
Henry.
ls he very pale, very thin?


860
01:06:29.090 --> 01:06:31.990
- His arms are scarred.
- Yeah, that's him.


861
01:06:32.190 --> 01:06:34.990
He always ate pecan pie with his coffee.
l remember that.


862
01:06:35.290 --> 01:06:37.090
But l never spoke to him
outside the diner.


863
01:06:37.190 --> 01:06:39.190
- Oh.
- Except-


864
01:06:39.390 --> 01:06:41.290
Yeah? What?

865
01:06:41.490 --> 01:06:44.190
l feel really stupid saying this stuff
to a psychiatrist.


866
01:06:44.390 --> 01:06:46.490
- You'll think l'm insane.
- No.


867
01:06:47.990 --> 01:06:50.090
l had the strangest feeling
about him.


868
01:06:50.290 --> 01:06:52.190
l mean, he's this
ragged-looking guy.


869
01:06:52.390 --> 01:06:55.790
Probably hasn't bathed in months,
but something about him.


870
01:06:55.990 --> 01:06:59.290
l'd seen him before.
Somewhere.


871
01:06:59.590 --> 01:07:02.090
l'd known him.

872
01:07:02.290 --> 01:07:06.190
- Yeah.
- What's wrong with him?


873
01:07:07.490 --> 01:07:09.290
He's going to kill himself.

874
01:07:09.490 --> 01:07:11.190
Why?

875
01:07:11.290 --> 01:07:14.590
He thinks he's done something terrible.
That's my guess anyway.


876
01:07:14.990 --> 01:07:18.190
l wish there was something
l could do to help.


877
01:07:18.390 --> 01:07:22.790
Actually, this probably won't help,
but l did run into him one time at A. Smith's.


878
01:07:23.190 --> 01:07:24.790
- A. Smith's?
- The art bookstore?


879
01:07:24.990 --> 01:07:26.890
He was sitting in the back, reading.

880
01:07:27.190 --> 01:07:28.990
l don't know.
Maybe he hangs out there.


881
01:07:29.190 --> 01:07:31.790
- Where is it?
- Nearby. Come on. l'll show you.


882
01:08:02.490 --> 01:08:05.290
Athena?

883
01:08:05.690 --> 01:08:07.990
Athena?

884
01:08:11.390 --> 01:08:14.090
Athena!

885
01:08:14.290 --> 01:08:16.390
Athena?

886
01:08:16.590 --> 01:08:19.790
Athena! Athena!

887
01:08:26.190 --> 01:08:29.290
l'm just trying
to figure out if l'm the king or the farmer.


888
01:08:40.690 --> 01:08:42.790
Still there.

889
01:09:04.490 --> 01:09:07.190
- Athena?
- We think not, my lord.


890
01:09:07.390 --> 01:09:10.190
Well, then 'tis none to you,
for there is nothing either good or bad...


891
01:09:10.390 --> 01:09:11.890
but thinking makes it so.

892
01:09:12.090 --> 01:09:15.090
- To me, it is a prison.
- Prison, my lord?


893
01:09:15.290 --> 01:09:17.690
Denmark's a prison.
We already had this conversation.


894
01:09:29.890 --> 01:09:32.990
Sonny Rollins. Hmm.

895
01:09:40.390 --> 01:09:42.090
Ah.

896
01:09:48.790 --> 01:09:51.390
- Are you lonely here?
- Who's that?


897
01:09:51.690 --> 01:09:54.590
- Who's there?

898
01:09:54.790 --> 01:09:57.990
- Why isn't Mom with you?

899
01:09:58.290 --> 01:10:00.590
l'll call the police.

900
01:10:00.790 --> 01:10:03.090
Put the phone down, Dad.

901
01:10:04.290 --> 01:10:06.290
lt's Henry.

902
01:10:06.390 --> 01:10:11.690
Henry?
What are you doing here?


903
01:10:11.990 --> 01:10:14.490
Just wanted to see you
one more time.


904
01:10:28.290 --> 01:10:30.390
Henry.

905
01:10:30.690 --> 01:10:33.090
l need you to leave now.

906
01:10:35.490 --> 01:10:38.590
You can't sneak
into people's homes.


907
01:10:41.390 --> 01:10:43.390
l don't wanna go, Dad.

908
01:10:43.690 --> 01:10:47.290
You've got the wrong man.

909
01:10:47.690 --> 01:10:50.590
l've told you before.

910
01:10:50.790 --> 01:10:52.590
l don't wanna die.

911
01:10:52.790 --> 01:10:57.490
You don't have to die.

912
01:10:57.790 --> 01:11:00.290
- Will you do something for me, Dad?
- What?


913
01:11:00.490 --> 01:11:03.290
- What are you doing?
- lt's okay. lt's okay.


914
01:11:05.290 --> 01:11:07.490
l want you to look at me, okay?

915
01:11:09.190 --> 01:11:11.090
Just look at me.

916
01:11:44.790 --> 01:11:47.190
- lt's just lightning.

917
01:11:49.190 --> 01:11:53.090
Remember that time we found
all those dead sparrows in the yard?


918
01:11:53.390 --> 01:11:57.490
Do you remember that?
They were in that tree that got hit by lightning.


919
01:12:00.090 --> 01:12:02.290
Who are you?

920
01:12:03.590 --> 01:12:05.390
l'm your son.

921
01:12:07.090 --> 01:12:10.090
No. No.

922
01:12:22.590 --> 01:12:24.490
Tell Mom l love her, all right?

923
01:12:46.190 --> 01:12:48.290
You should show your mother your paintings.

924
01:12:48.590 --> 01:12:50.990
- Yeah, well,you know...

925
01:12:51.190 --> 01:12:53.190
Doesn't Athena look beautiful tonight?

926
01:12:53.390 --> 01:12:56.090
- They remind me of us when
we met all those years ago.


927
01:12:56.390 --> 01:12:58.190
- Yeah.

928
01:12:58.390 --> 01:13:01.290
How have you guys stayed
so in love after all these years?


929
01:13:01.590 --> 01:13:02.390
- Well, it's simple-

930
01:13:02.390 --> 01:13:03.790
- Well, it's simple-

931
01:14:00.490 --> 01:14:02.290
We're closed.

932
01:14:02.490 --> 01:14:04.990
Ben, let him in.
See what he wants.


933
01:14:06.790 --> 01:14:09.690
- All right.

934
01:14:13.990 --> 01:14:15.790
Can l help you find something?

935
01:14:15.890 --> 01:14:17.490
Henry Letham.

936
01:14:17.690 --> 01:14:20.190
A book by Henry Letham
or on Henry Letham?


937
01:14:20.390 --> 01:14:22.490
No, l-l thought
he might be here.


938
01:14:22.690 --> 01:14:24.990
l was told he comes here sometimes.

939
01:14:25.290 --> 01:14:28.090
Nobody's here, man,
'cause the store is closed.


940
01:14:28.290 --> 01:14:30.690
How about you don't
fuck with me right now?


941
01:14:33.390 --> 01:14:37.190
- Smitty, you know a guy named Henry Letham?
- Sure.


942
01:14:37.490 --> 01:14:40.590
- Something happen to him?
- Yeah, l need to find him.


943
01:14:40.790 --> 01:14:42.990
l keep telling the kid
to get some sun.


944
01:14:43.190 --> 01:14:47.590
lt's not healthy spending all your time
in bookstores. Yeah, that's his.


945
01:14:47.890 --> 01:14:51.090
He didn't have any money to pay for the books
he wanted, so he gave me this.


946
01:14:51.390 --> 01:14:54.590
l think l got a pretty good deal.
The kid's got talent, huh?


947
01:14:54.790 --> 01:14:56.690
He traded the painting for some books?
Which books?


948
01:14:56.890 --> 01:14:58.690
Tristan Reveur.
What else?


949
01:14:58.890 --> 01:15:00.790
The kid's obsessed with Reveur.

950
01:15:00.990 --> 01:15:03.190
- You got any more of his books?
- No, he bought me out.


951
01:15:03.390 --> 01:15:06.090
lt's all secondhand,
out-of-print stuff.


952
01:15:06.290 --> 01:15:10.090
Right. Thanks.

953
01:15:10.490 --> 01:15:12.990
So, what do you think?
ls he gonna make it?


954
01:15:13.190 --> 01:15:15.190
What?

955
01:15:15.390 --> 01:15:18.890
You think he's got what it takes?

956
01:15:20.890 --> 01:15:24.090
Yeah. Yeah.

957
01:17:34.790 --> 01:17:36.590
- Hello?
- lt's me.


958
01:17:36.690 --> 01:17:39.490
Jesus, Sam, where are you?
Are you okay?


959
01:17:39.790 --> 01:17:43.290
l'm fine. Listen. Tristan Reveur killed himself
on his 21st birthday, right?


960
01:17:43.490 --> 01:17:47.090
Oh, God, it's that kid's

961
01:17:47.390 --> 01:17:49.590
Yeah.
How'd he kill himself?


962
01:17:49.790 --> 01:17:52.590
Um, he shot himself
on the Brooklyn Bridge.


963
01:17:52.790 --> 01:17:57.090
He said it was the best artwork
of the 19th century.


964
01:17:57.290 --> 01:17:59.890
- Hello?
- Lila, listen.


965
01:18:00.090 --> 01:18:02.590
l need you to know something.
l trust you.


966
01:18:02.790 --> 01:18:06.190
- l trust you more than anyone in the world.
- What's going on, Sam?


967
01:18:06.490 --> 01:18:08.690
Listen, if anything happens tonight,
you know l love you.


968
01:18:08.990 --> 01:18:10.690
lt's the one thing l know is real.

969
01:18:10.790 --> 01:18:12.690
l'm worried about you.

970
01:18:12.890 --> 01:18:15.790
Don't be.
l love you, Lila.


971
01:18:15.890 --> 01:18:17.790
- Sam?

972
01:18:21.490 --> 01:18:25.290
- Leon?
- l always thought you had brown eyes.


973
01:18:31.290 --> 01:18:34.390
- You can see.
- l can see everything.


974
01:18:34.690 --> 01:18:37.390
- For the first time, l can see everything.
- But how?


975
01:18:37.590 --> 01:18:39.390
Henry.
lt's all because of Henry.


976
01:19:13.690 --> 01:19:15.890
What's happening to us?

977
01:19:16.090 --> 01:19:18.490
The Buddhists had it right
all along.


978
01:19:18.690 --> 01:19:20.790
The world is an illusion.

979
01:19:22.390 --> 01:19:25.890
- What time is it?
- lt's 11:33.


980
01:19:26.090 --> 01:19:28.590
Check.

981
01:19:30.890 --> 01:19:32.190
Saturday night in the rain!

982
01:19:32.290 --> 01:19:32.990
Saturday night in the rain!

983
01:19:33.990 --> 01:19:35.890
You'll never find a cab.

984
01:19:58.690 --> 01:20:00.490
Damn it.

985
01:20:24.290 --> 01:20:27.990
Listen to my voice, Henry. 
Stay with me, okay?

986
01:20:47.990 --> 01:20:50.290
Mommy, is that man gonna die?

987
01:20:50.490 --> 01:20:53.990
Well, l hope not,
baby. l don't think so.

988
01:21:42.590 --> 01:21:46.390
- Brooklyn Bridge-

989
01:23:20.090 --> 01:23:21.890
Henry.

990
01:23:37.790 --> 01:23:40.690
One of the first times l met you...

991
01:23:40.890 --> 01:23:43.590
you said...

992
01:23:43.890 --> 01:23:45.290
that you didn't know
what was real anymore.


993
01:23:45.290 --> 01:23:46.690
that you didn't know
what was real anymore.


994
01:23:46.990 --> 01:23:48.790
And l said that l did.

995
01:23:48.990 --> 01:23:50.990
But l was wrong.

996
01:23:52.990 --> 01:23:55.890
l don't know what's real anymore.

997
01:23:57.690 --> 01:23:59.590
You are.

998
01:24:01.690 --> 01:24:03.790
You're real.

999
01:24:03.990 --> 01:24:06.790
And you're trying to save me.
You're just too late.


1000
01:24:08.690 --> 01:24:10.890
'Cause l gotta wake up.

1001
01:24:13.390 --> 01:24:15.190
You are awake.

1002
01:24:22.390 --> 01:24:25.390
Henry, look around you.

1003
01:24:29.390 --> 01:24:32.390
lf this is a dream,
the whole world's inside it.


1004
01:24:48.490 --> 01:24:50.290
This hurts too much.

1005
01:24:53.690 --> 01:24:56.490
- l wish you didn't have to see this.
- Henry.


1006
01:25:19.790 --> 01:25:23.090
lt happened in front of me. lt was right

Okay, maintain pressure on that.
Keep an eye on his pulse.

Hey, Henry, listen.
