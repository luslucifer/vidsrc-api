25
00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:47.520
很久没有看过这种大场面
Haven't been to such a big event in a while.


26

洪爷果然够派头
Boss Hung sure loved extravagance.


27
00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:53.390
那个疯子 真的从台北过来把他干掉了

28
00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:55.520
你说谁
Who?


29
00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:59.100
一个叫做桂林仔的人
They call him the "Kuilin Kid".


30
00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:02.640
什么桂林仔
Kuilin Kid?


31
00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:03.640
靠 我跟你说
I'm telling you.


32
00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:05.020
虽然他是个疯子
He might be a lunatic,


33
00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:07.190
但我真的觉得他挺猛的
but I think he's pretty awesome.


34
00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:11.021
你认识他
You know him?


35
00:03:14.021 --> 00:03:17.191
桂林仔 是中山区顶厝庄 任因九的细汉
The Kuilin Kid is a young gun from the streets of Zhongshan District.


36
00:03:17.981 --> 00:03:19.101
两个月前

37
00:03:19.731 --> 00:03:23.021
九哥到洪爷的赌场赢了八百多万
Brother Nine won NT$8 million at Boss Hung's casino.


38
00:03:23.101 --> 00:03:24.231
洪爷不认账
Boss Hung wouldn't pay up,


39
00:03:24.311 --> 00:03:27.141
九哥一怒之下 叫桂林仔去收债
so Brother Nine told Kuilin Kid to go collect the debt.


40
00:03:27.231 --> 00:03:28.481
你知道结果怎么样

桂林仔拿着手榴弹
Kuilin Kid brought a grenade.


44
00:03:35.601 --> 00:03:36.891
手榴弹喔
A grenade!


45
00:03:37.601 --> 00:03:38.561
到了那边
Once he got there,


46
00:03:38.641 --> 00:03:40.141
拿了八百万之后
and collected the NT$8 million,


47
00:03:40.231 --> 00:03:41.891
炸爆整个赌场
he blew up the casino.


48
00:03:43.641 --> 00:03:45.731
干掉洪爷 你说他屌不屌
Killed Boss Hung. Isn't he cool?


49
00:03:46.941 --> 00:03:48.891
-屌 -屌吼
- Cool. - Right?


50
00:03:53.601 --> 00:03:55.561
但是枪打出头鸟了
But he may have shot himself in the foot.


51
00:03:56.561 --> 00:03:58.891
铁头哥下了追杀令之后
Now that Ironhead has issued a kill order,


52
00:04:01.141 --> 00:04:03.311
看来桂林仔是凶多吉少
it looks like the odds are against Kuilin Kid.


53
00:04:10.101 --> 00:04:11.271

It's not too much. 


57
00:04:17.061 --> 00:04:18.891
几万块而已啊
Just a few grand.


58

64
00:04:40.021 --> 00:04:41.311
铁头哥来了

等等一起回台北
Let's go back to Taipei together.


67
00:04:44.731 --> 00:04:45.981
我叫陈桂林
I'm Chen Kui-lin.


68
00:04:46.061 --> 00:04:47.271
我有名有姓
I have a real name.


69
00:04:47.351 --> 00:04:48.891

你看这肺 都化白了

85
00:13:12.024 --> 00:13:13.734
恐怕也来不及

86
00:13:14.984 --> 00:13:16.024
换肺呢

贵卿

88
00:13:20.524 --> 00:13:21.734

这样的情况 你应该很清楚

90
00:13:51.694 --> 00:13:54.854
你奶奶出事了 赶快过来一下

00:14:01.484 --> 00:14:03.194
张小姐 怎么现在才来
Ms. Chang, what took you so long?


92

医生等你好久了

刚刚照了CT扫描

她整个腹腔胀得很严重

102
00:14:24.604 --> 00:14:26.194
手术要签同意书
I need a signed consent form.


103
00:14:27.024 --> 00:14:29.274
养老院那边的人不愿意签
The nursing home won't do it.


104
00:14:29.354 --> 00:14:31.814
你是她联络簿上唯一可以联络到的人
You're the only contact we could to get in touch with.


105
00:14:31.894 --> 00:14:33.524
所以要求你来签字

106
00:14:34.644 --> 00:14:36.524
还是她有其他亲人

107
00:14:40.524 --> 00:14:41.984
赶快做决定吧
Make a decision now.


108
00:14:42.064 --> 00:14:43.314
如果手术中
If her life is in danger


109
00:14:43.394 --> 00:14:44.734
奶奶有生命危险
during surgery,


110
00:14:44.814 --> 00:14:46.064
抢不抢救
do we resuscitate?


111
00:14:48.854 --> 00:14:50.274
插不插管
Do we intubate?


112
00:14:52.564 --> 00:14:54.694
我们就按照正常手术程序
We'll follow regular surgery procedures.


113

必要时

医生
Doctor.


117
00:15:03.524 --> 00:15:05.564
拜托不要插管
Please, no intubation.


118
00:15:11.144 --> 00:15:13.394
（手术中）

119
00:15:15.234 --> 00:15:17.354
这种手术成功率有多大
What are the chances of success?


120
00:15:26.854 --> 00:15:30.394
你是希望她手术成功还是不成功
Do you want her surgery to be successful?


121
00:15:36.524 --> 00:15:39.734
如果手术成功你能回来照顾她吗
If it is, will you be able to take care of her?


122
00:15:41.484 --> 00:15:43.814
她最多就是住几天医院
After a few days in hospital,


123
00:15:44.944 --> 00:15:47.144
最后还是要回到养老院
she still has to return to the nursing home.


124
00:16:05.895 --> 00:16:06.895
放学啦
You finished school?


125
00:16:07.695 --> 00:16:09.065
妈妈还在工作
Mommy is still working.


126
00:16:09.145 --> 00:16:10.815
你跟爸爸先吃
You eat with Daddy first.


127
00:16:40.445 --> 00:16:41.855
怎么样
How did it go?


128
00:16:58.235 --> 00:17:00.565
发生车祸的是一辆载满鸡蛋的货车
The accident was between a truck full of eggs


129
00:17:00.945 --> 00:17:02.605
以及一台运钞车
and a cash transport vehicle.


130
00:17:02.695 --> 00:17:03.895
两台车相撞之后
After the collision,


131
00:17:03.985 --> 00:17:05.145
鸡蛋散布满地

132
00:17:05.235 --> 00:17:07.315
而千元大钞全飞散出来

133
00:17:07.395 --> 00:17:09.485
警方也呼吁这些在现场的民众

134

主动将捡拾到的钞票

135
00:17:11.395 --> 00:17:13.695
尽快归还到邻近的派出所
to their nearest police station as soon as possible,


136
00:17:13.775 --> 00:17:16.485
同时也强调 如果将钞票占为己有
emphasizing that keeping the cash


137
00:17:16.565 --> 00:17:18.815
可能会触犯侵占遗失物的罪行
constitutes misappropriation of lost property.


138
00:17:18.895 --> 00:17:20.695
请民众主动自首投案 切勿以身试法 
Residents are advised to turn themselves in and not test the law.


139

143
00:17:30.445 --> 00:17:33.695
去年生日买了一只手表

00:30:22.199 --> 00:30:24.819
已经是二十年前的事了
was over 20 years ago.


289
00:30:26.359 --> 00:30:29.319
当天正是吴兴街枪战事件
It was the day of the Wuxing St. shootout.


290
00:30:29.399 --> 00:30:31.029
晚上十点
At 10:00 p.m.,


291
00:30:31.109 --> 00:30:32.859
几个小弟抬着他冲了进来
a few underlings carried him in,


292
00:30:32.949 --> 00:30:34.739
要我帮他抢救
asking me to save him.


293
00:30:34.819 --> 00:30:37.739
其中一颗子弹就打进了他的脑袋里
One bullet was lodged in his head.


294
00:30:38.779 --> 00:30:41.779
当时我手边没有做手术的仪器
I didn't have any surgery equipment with me.


295
00:30:42.739 --> 00:30:45.449
就算有我也不敢动手
I wouldn't dare operate even if I did.


296
00:30:46.319 --> 00:30:47.819
结果那颗子弹
That bullet is still


297
00:30:47.899 --> 00:30:51.109
就永远留在香港仔的脑袋里了
stuck in Hongkie's head.


298
00:30:52.109 --> 00:30:54.529
之后他几乎每天头痛
He has headaches almost every day.


299
00:30:55.359 --> 00:30:57.699
我只能帮他配一些止痛药
I can only prescribe him some painkillers,


300
00:30:58.569 --> 00:31:00.819
让他每个月派人来拿
which someone fetches for him every month.


301
00:31:01.399 --> 00:31:03.239
是谁帮他拿药
Who fetches his medicine?


302
00:31:04.149 --> 00:31:05.029
好
Okay.


303
00:31:06.609 --> 00:31:07.819
好 我知道了
Okay, I understand.


304
00:31:14.029 --> 00:31:15.319
从十年前开始
For about 10 years now,


305
00:31:15.399 --> 00:31:18.699
就有一个叫小美的女生来帮他拿药
a girl named Hsiao-mei has been getting his medicine.


306
00:31:20.199 --> 00:31:22.319
那时候她才十几岁
She was only a teenager back then.


307
00:31:23.109 --> 00:31:25.529
她是什么背景我都不知道
I know nothing about her background.


308
00:31:27.649 --> 00:31:28.989
叫小美
Her name is Hsiao-mei?


309
00:31:31.029 --> 00:31:32.489
程小美
Cheng Hsiao-mei.


310
00:31:33.989 --> 00:31:35.069
程小美

311
00:31:38.319 --> 00:31:39.739
我帮你拍张照
Let me take a photo.


312

一 二 三 耶
One, two, three, yeah.

你儿子这么喜欢吃冰
Your son sure loves ice cream.


314
00:31:51.280 --> 00:31:52.740
对牙齿应该不好
It's not good for his teeth.


315
00:31:55.530 --> 00:31:58.740
你绑架人还担心他牙齿好不好啊
You kidnapped him and you're worried about his teeth?


316
00:31:59.820 --> 00:32:00.950
林禄和呢
Where's Lin Lu-ho?


317
00:32:01.900 --> 00:32:04.110
这个人消失很久了
He disappeared a long time ago.


318
00:32:07.530 --> 00:32:11.070
十几年前 从我这里寄了一封信给他妈妈
Over a decade ago, he sent a letter from here to his mom.


319
00:32:12.700 --> 00:32:14.320
这是他妈妈的回信
This is her reply.


320
00:32:16.650 --> 00:32:18.650
（高雄市老人长期照顾中心 杨淑珍）

321
00:32:24.360 --> 00:32:26.070
（一失足成千古恨 再回头已百年身）

322
00:32:26.150 --> 00:32:27.610
（舍弃贪 嗔 痴 来生再做新的人）

323
00:32:27.780 --> 00:32:29.740
我知道的都已经告诉你了
I've told you everything I know.


324

我儿子在哪

见到程小美我就会告诉你

妈 好重喔
Mom, it's so heavy!


328
00:33:35.240 --> 00:33:37.030
你有没有怎样我看一下
Are you hurt? Let me take a look.


329
00:33:37.820 --> 00:33:39.200
没有
No.


330
00:34:35.740 --> 00:34:37.070
要住房吗
Would you like a room?


331
00:34:37.150 --> 00:34:38.360
有房间吗
Any vacancies?

334
00:35:32.741 --> 00:35:36.321
但他的货质量好
But his stuff is so cheap.


335
00:35:36.401 --> 00:35:37.451
你的手怎么了
What happened to your hand?


336
00:35:37.531 --> 00:35:39.071
没事
Nothing.


337
00:35:39.781 --> 00:35:41.901
那个老鼠明
That Rat Ming


338
00:35:41.991 --> 00:35:46.571
跟他拿些货 跟我算钱
was trying to haggle over every cent,


339
00:35:46.651 --> 00:35:48.491
捅了他几下
so I stabbed him a few times.


340
00:35:49.401 --> 00:35:51.531
你要不要我帮你擦药
Want me to put on some ointment?


341
00:35:52.031 --> 00:35:54.571
没事 小问题
I'm fine. No big deal.


342
00:35:55.321 --> 00:35:57.401
不然我帮你拿头痛药
You want your headache pills?


343
00:35:57.821 --> 00:35:58.821
不用
No need.


344
00:36:04.281 --> 00:36:05.651
把这洗干净
Clean this up.


345
00:36:07.861 --> 00:36:09.531
怎样 有什么吃

Shit.Pig blood and duck blood again.Don't you still think there's enough blood?


348
00:37:01.951 --> 00:37:03.491
抽支烟
Let's go for a smoke.


349
00:37:06.991 --> 00:37:09.241
你刚才笑什么
What were you laughing at?


350
00:37:10.071 --> 00:37:11.611
没有 老大
Nothing, boss.


351

我问你刚才笑什么
I asked you what were you laughing at.


352

对不起 老大
Sorry, boss.


353
00:37:16.241 --> 00:37:19.031
你想到了什么笑成这样
Something must have made you laugh.


354
00:37:30.901 --> 00:37:33.951
你说个原因出来 可能我会明白
If you give me a reason, maybe I'll understand.


355
00:37:35.901 --> 00:37:39.531
但你现在不说我就觉得很受伤
But not saying anything really hurts me.


356
00:37:41.741 --> 00:37:43.241
证明你
It means


357
00:37:44.321 --> 00:37:48.611
心里想着些脏东西 连说都不敢说
you have dirty thoughts you don't dare to say.


358
00:37:55.651 --> 00:37:57.781
喝了多少瓶

吃什么
What are you eating?


367
00:40:23.032 --> 00:40:26.072
今天我托人送了些东西给你妈妈
I got some stuff delivered to your mom today.


368
00:40:28.572 --> 00:40:31.612
现在监狱的规矩真麻烦

连椰子和百香果都不行

椰子不行我明白
Coconut I understand.


373
00:40:47.532 --> 00:40:50.072
打在头上真的会死人
You can kill someone with that.


374
00:40:50.152 --> 00:40:53.072
但百香果不行真的很奇怪
But banning passionfruit makes no sense.


375
00:40:53.152 --> 00:40:55.322
百香果怎么杀人呢
How can you kill someone with a passionfruit?


376
00:40:55.862 --> 00:40:57.362
呛死吗

Don't worry.


378

They're mostly calls to her husband,


382
00:42:21.783 --> 00:42:24.153
但是这两天有出现另外两个号码

其中一个是便利商店买的电话卡

另外一个是台中的店家

而在中南部地区阳光露脸

中午的温度在中南部的朋友
People in these areas,


390
00:42:39.863 --> 00:42:42.113
可以明显感觉到中午就热了起来

391
00:42:42.203 --> 00:42:44.363
到了30到31度的高温

00:43:17.953 --> 00:43:19.453
是来剪头发的吗
Are you here for a haircut?


397
00:43:20.153 --> 00:43:22.153
不然你先进去好了
Please go inside first.


398
00:43:29.743 --> 00:43:32.033
你今天想要剪头发还是修胡子
Do you want a cut or a shave?


399
00:43:34.493 --> 00:43:35.573
修胡子
Shave.


400
00:43:36.453 --> 00:43:38.703
你想要修一点还是全部刮掉

没关系 我们先修一点
It's okay. Let's trim a little bit,


402
00:43:42.533 --> 00:43:44.113

403
00:43:44.203 --> 00:43:45.033
好
Okay.


404
00:43:45.113 --> 00:43:46.203
等一下喔
Please wait.


405
00:44:23.283 --> 00:44:25.573
你看起来不像台中人
You don't look like you're from Taichung.


406
00:44:27.073 --> 00:44:29.243
来找朋友
I'm here to see friends.


407
00:44:31.113 --> 00:44:34.284
你这胡子很久没刮了吗
When was the last time you shaved?


408
00:44:35.154 --> 00:44:36.454
一两天吧

那你的生长激素很厉害耶
Your growth hormones are impressive.

跟你说过多少遍

修胡子 两边要对齐
The two sides need to be even.


414
00:45:18.614 --> 00:45:19.654
先生

一点点
A little.

00:45:23.824 --> 00:45:25.204
我帮你修一下好吗
How about I fix it for you?


418
00:45:26.704 --> 00:45:27.614
好
Sure.


419
00:45:29.534 --> 00:45:32.864
你上去帮我拿酒
Go upstairs and fetch my liquor.


420
00:45:37.074 --> 00:45:40.784
平常很少人只修胡子
Not many come in for just a beard trim.


421
00:45:40.864 --> 00:45:42.204
你挺特别的
You're quite unusual.


422

约了朋友在这边碰
I've got a friendly catch-up,


423
00:45:45.114 --> 00:45:46.654
所以想修一修

424
00:45:47.494 --> 00:45:49.784
朋友在这边开店吗
Your friend owns a store around here?


425
00:45:52.404 --> 00:45:53.454
没有
No.


426
00:45:55.404 --> 00:45:56.904
只是约在这边
We're just meeting here


427

428
00:46:00.034 --> 00:46:01.704
男的

Isn't it good to live without a purpose?


575
01:08:34.121 --> 01:08:36.831
目的是人脑想出来的
Purpose is invented by man,


576
01:08:36.911 --> 01:08:39.661
必然是关于世俗之物
so it must surely relate to worldly things.


577
01:08:39.751 --> 01:08:42.711
一昧地追求世俗的向往
Blindly pursuing worldly desires


578
01:08:42.791 --> 01:08:45.081
这是愚昧的事情
is a foolish thing.


579
01:08:47.291 --> 01:08:48.211
贪
Greed,


580
01:08:49.001 --> 01:08:49.871
嗔
anger,


581
01:08:50.751 --> 01:08:51.661
痴
and delusion


582
01:08:52.371 --> 01:08:54.121
是所有烦恼的根源
are the roots of all suffering.


583
01:08:54.911 --> 01:08:57.661
这些都是浪费生命的毒害
These are all life-wasting poisons.


584
01:08:57.751 --> 01:08:59.751
所以回过头来
So, looking back,


585
01:09:00.581 --> 01:09:03.541
也许生命的意义
perhaps the meaning of life


586
01:09:04.331 --> 01:09:06.501
是它根本没意义
is to have no meaning at all.

Did you know that?


611
01:10:57.122 --> 01:10:59.622
身体里有不干净的东西
There's something unclean inside you.

什么不干净
What's unclean?


613

我非常感谢尊者

627
01:12:47.332 --> 01:12:49.002
感谢他为我开悟

628
01:12:50.412 --> 01:12:51.912
他的开悟
His enlightenment


629
01:12:52.002 --> 01:12:54.792
胜过了无数次的手术
 is more effective than any surgery.


630
01:12:54.872 --> 01:12:56.252
是他
Because of him,


631
01:12:56.752 --> 01:12:59.832
让我成为了一个新造的人

但是悟到道理的人不是我

你为什么会来到这里
Why did you come here?


661
01:14:50.213 --> 01:14:51.963
我想找一个人
I'm looking for someone.


662

Who?


663
01:14:54.713 --> 01:14:56.213
他叫林禄和
His name is Lin Lu-ho.


664
01:14:58.253 --> 01:15:00.003
你是警察
You're a cop?


665
01:15:01.663 --> 01:15:03.583
我不是警察
I'm not a cop.


666
01:15:03.663 --> 01:15:05.873
那就是道上兄弟
Then you must be a gangster.


667
01:15:07.213 --> 01:15:09.293
有人托我把东西交给他
I was entrusted to give something to him.


668
01:15:10.413 --> 01:15:12.873
我得自己把东西给他
I must hand it to him myself.


669
01:15:24.963 --> 01:15:26.623
这就是你要找的人
This is who you're looking for.


670
01:15:30.083 --> 01:15:32.293
也许他不希望人家记得他
Perhaps he doesn't want to be remembered.


671
01:15:33.413 --> 01:15:34.833
他什么时候死的
When did he die?


672
01:15:35.163 --> 01:15:37.413
很久以前了
A long time ago.


673
01:15:37.503 --> 01:15:41.003
当时他好像是被通缉
I think he was a fugitive at the time.


674
01:15:41.163 --> 01:15:42.753
一直跑路
Constantly on the run.


675
01:15:44.373 --> 01:15:46.663
最后跑到了澎湖
He ended up in Penghu.

682

不用救我
Don't save me.


683

我是个罪人
I'm a sinner.


684
01:16:28.754 --> 01:16:30.834
不该得到救赎
I don't deserve salvation.


685
01:16:34.874 --> 01:16:37.044
这是上天的安排
It was God's plan


686
01:16:37.664 --> 01:16:40.124
让我在这里碰到几位
for me to meet you all here.


687
01:16:41.794 --> 01:16:42.964
我今晚
Tonight,


688
01:16:43.714 --> 01:16:45.834
就葬在这里
I shall be buried here.


689
01:16:46.004 --> 01:16:48.254
我看见了我的坟墓
I saw my grave,


690
01:16:50.714 --> 01:16:54.334
也看见了你们的坟墓
and I also saw your graves.


691
01:16:56.914 --> 01:17:00.334
我看到了宇宙诞生的那一刻
I saw the moment the universe was born.


692
01:17:02.544 --> 01:17:04.914
我看到了我的一生
I saw my life,


693
01:17:07.374 --> 01:17:10.544
也看到了你们的一生
and I also saw your lives.


694
01:17:26.374 --> 01:17:29.414
他知道我们每个人的姓名
He knew all of our names,


695
01:17:29.504 --> 01:17:31.414
出生地点
where we were born,


696
01:17:31.504 --> 01:17:33.714
能活到几岁
and at what age we will die.


697
01:17:33.794 --> 01:17:35.794
他是特异的人
He was an extraordinary person.


698
01:17:36.664 --> 01:17:38.254
最后
In the end,


699
01:17:38.334 --> 01:17:41.834
他吩咐我们在湖西乡找一个地点
he instructed us to find a spot in Huxi Township


700
01:17:41.914 --> 01:17:44.584
开设一所新心灵社
and establish the New Spiritual Society,


701
01:17:44.664 --> 01:17:46.834
让众生免于痛苦
to free all sentient beings from suffering.


702
01:17:48.664 --> 01:17:50.294
也许
Perhaps,


703
01:17:51.544 --> 01:17:53.914
你和林禄和有什么前世恩怨
you hold some grudge against Lin Lu-ho.


704
01:17:54.914 --> 01:17:57.584
但是如果你不抛开执着
But if you don't let go of your attachments,


705
01:17:58.214 --> 01:18:00.664
你的死期也将近
your death will be near.


706
01:18:00.874 --> 01:18:02.544
我会死在这
Will I die here?


707
01:18:03.044 --> 01:18:04.334
我不知道
I don't know.


708
01:18:04.664 --> 01:18:06.214
我不能帮助你永生
I can't make you live forever.


709
01:18:07.044 --> 01:18:08.464
只能帮你治病
I can only treat your illness.


710
01:18:10.294 --> 01:18:12.044
人的死
A person's death


711
01:18:12.124 --> 01:18:13.794
都是咎由自取的
is always the result of their own actions.


712
01:19:05.294 --> 01:19:07.084
待会我说一句
Every time I say a line,


713
01:19:07.164 --> 01:19:08.914
你跟着我说一句
you repeat after me.


714
01:19:13.874 --> 01:19:15.374
我感谢天地
I thank heaven and earth.


715
01:19:16.124 --> 01:19:17.794
我感谢天地
I thank heaven and earth!

I'm a sinner.


719
01:19:24.414 --> 01:19:26.374
我是罪人
I'm a sinner!


720
01:19:27.664 --> 01:19:29.084
我危害人间
I have harmed the world.


721
01:19:29.874 --> 01:19:31.544
我危害人间
I have harmed the world!


722
01:19:32.334 --> 01:19:33.915
我辜负苍生
I let the world down.


723
01:19:34.545 --> 01:19:36.165
我辜负苍生
I let the world down!


724
01:19:44.125 --> 01:19:46.005
我愿抛开一切
I'm willing to abandon everything.


725
01:19:47.215 --> 01:19:49.085
我愿抛开一切
I'm willing to abandon everything!


726
01:19:50.465 --> 01:19:52.215
消除名利权力
Forgo fame, fortune, and power.


727
01:19:52.415 --> 01:19:54.915
消除名利权力
Forgo fame, fortune, and power!


728
01:19:56.625 --> 01:19:58.465
舍弃金钱物质
Give up money and material possessions.


729
01:19:58.915 --> 01:20:01.255
舍弃金钱物质
Give up money and material possessions!


730
01:20:02.795 --> 01:20:04.375
归于真我
Return to my true self.


731
01:20:05.415 --> 01:20:07.465
归于真我
Return to my true self!


732
01:21:24.005 --> 01:21:25.005
我先过去
I'm heading over.


733
01:21:38.795 --> 01:21:42.545
上次你说要亲手交给林禄和的东西
You said you had to give something to Lin Lu-ho.


734
01:21:42.625 --> 01:21:43.755
是什么
What is it?


735
01:21:46.255 --> 01:21:47.755
他妈妈的骨灰
His mother's ashes.


736
01:21:51.045 --> 01:21:52.915
你认识他母亲
You knew his mother?


737
01:22:06.165 --> 01:22:08.005
你说你是末期肺癌
You said you have terminal lung cancer?


738
01:22:08.625 --> 01:22:09.465
对
Yes.


739
01:22:09.545 --> 01:22:10.665
第四期
Stage 4.


740
01:22:11.375 --> 01:22:12.375
第四期
Stage 4.


741
01:22:15.125 --> 01:22:16.875
可是按目前来看
But from what I can see,


742
01:22:16.965 --> 01:22:19.045
没有你说的那么严重
it's not as serious as you say.


743
01:22:20.545 --> 01:22:23.215
按照这个X光片来看的话
Based on this X-ray,


744
01:22:23.295 --> 01:22:25.835
我是没有办法断定是第四期
I can't confirm that you are stage 4.


745
01:22:27.335 --> 01:22:29.255
你看这个阴影的部分
This shadow here


746
01:22:30.165 --> 01:22:32.465
这有可能是癌细胞
could be cancer cells,


747
01:22:32.545 --> 01:22:35.665
不过还要抽取细胞化验会比较准确
but a biopsy would give us more certainty.


748
01:22:36.505 --> 01:22:38.375
然后还有这些白白的
There's also these white parts.


749
01:22:38.965 --> 01:22:40.965
有钙化的迹象
Signs of calcification.


750
01:22:41.045 --> 01:22:42.125
这个
This is


751
01:22:42.215 --> 01:22:43.916
是正在康复的组织
recovering tissue.


752
01:22:45.836 --> 01:22:46.966
如果你说
If you say


753
01:22:47.876 --> 01:22:50.716
你之前是癌症第四期
you had stage 4 cancer before,


754
01:22:51.716 --> 01:22:54.546
那代表你的癌细胞正在自我消灭
that means your cancer cells are self-destructing.


755
01:23:01.256 --> 01:23:03.756
你怎么把我光片给撕了你
How could you... rip up my X-ray?


756
01:23:04.796 --> 01:23:06.626
你把它撕破了
You ripped it.


757
01:23:09.586 --> 01:23:13.006
那能说他这样会好起来吗
Does that mean he'll recover?


758
01:23:13.756 --> 01:23:14.756
这个
That's...


759
01:23:15.376 --> 01:23:16.626
很难讲啊
hard to say.


760
01:23:17.416 --> 01:23:19.336
像这种奇迹
Such miracles


761
01:23:19.416 --> 01:23:20.836
不是不可能
aren't impossible.


762
01:23:20.916 --> 01:23:22.716
但万中无一
But it's very rare.


763
01:23:23.216 --> 01:23:24.166
我看
I think


764
01:23:24.256 --> 01:23:26.086
你还是要多观察一段时间
we need to observe for a little longer


765
01:23:26.166 --> 01:23:28.006
我们才能下结论
before reaching any conclusions.


766
01:24:12.126 --> 01:24:13.336
尊者
Your Holiness.


767
01:24:13.416 --> 01:24:15.086
这个我特别帮你做的
I made this especially for you.


768
01:24:15.166 --> 01:24:16.086
请坐
Please sit.


769
01:24:16.506 --> 01:24:18.666
这是林禄和母亲的骨灰
This is Lin Lu-ho's mother's ashes.


770
01:24:18.756 --> 01:24:20.466
这个是我带来的钱
This is the money I brought with me.


771
01:24:22.296 --> 01:24:24.006
这里有多少钱
How much money is in here?


772
01:24:25.336 --> 01:24:26.626
一百万
NT$1 million.


773
01:24:26.716 --> 01:24:28.086
放进去
Put it inside.


774
01:24:36.916 --> 01:24:38.506
银行还有存款吗
Any money in bank accounts?


775
01:24:40.166 --> 01:24:41.376
都在这
It's all here.


776
01:24:42.416 --> 01:24:44.666
手表也放进去
Put your watch in there too.


777
01:24:55.466 --> 01:24:57.086
这个不行
Not this.


778
01:25:00.086 --> 01:25:02.756
这个是我奶奶留给我的
My grandma left me this.


779
01:25:03.376 --> 01:25:07.216
我知道抛开世俗之物不是件容易的事
I know it's not easy letting go of worldly possessions.


780
01:25:08.216 --> 01:25:10.506
如果你现在还会犹豫
If you are still hesitant,


781
01:25:11.166 --> 01:25:13.256
那表示时机还没到
it means the timing is not right.


782
01:25:14.166 --> 01:25:15.336
没关系
That's okay,


783
01:25:16.256 --> 01:25:18.256
你可以都拿回去
you can take it all back.


784
01:26:51.717 --> 01:26:52.587
饭菜端出去
Serve the food,


785
01:26:52.667 --> 01:26:53.627
然后这盘给小胖
and give this to Pao.


786
01:26:53.717 --> 01:26:54.667
好 知道
Okay.


787
01:27:01.837 --> 01:27:03.967
是不是有小朋友一个人啊
Did you come here by yourself?


788
01:27:04.047 --> 01:27:05.587
没有 我跟妈妈来
No, I came with my mom.


789
01:27:05.667 --> 01:27:07.667
-你肚子饿吗 -饿
- Are you hungry? - Yes.


790
01:27:07.757 --> 01:27:09.297
-给你 -谢谢
- This is yours. - Thank you.


791
01:27:09.377 --> 01:27:10.337
不客气
Welcome.


792
01:27:11.047 --> 01:27:11.967
师姐
Senior sister.


793
01:27:12.377 --> 01:27:13.547
我再帮你拿一份饭菜
I'll get another serving for you.


794
01:27:13.627 --> 01:27:15.217
不用 我斋戒中
No need, I'm fasting.


795
01:27:15.297 --> 01:27:16.167
-好 -谢谢
 - Okay. - Thanks.


796
01:27:16.257 --> 01:27:17.967
那你如果还饿再告诉我
Let me know if you're hungry.


797
01:27:18.257 --> 01:27:19.877
好 谢谢
Okay, thank you.


798
01:27:19.967 --> 01:27:21.377
拜拜
Bye.


799
01:27:25.007 --> 01:27:27.757
你们有想过死了以后会去哪里吗
Where do you think you'll go when you die?


800
01:27:27.837 --> 01:27:29.007
天堂
Heaven.


801
01:27:30.587 --> 01:27:32.667
你怎么知道你是去天堂
How do you know you'll go to heaven?


802
01:27:32.757 --> 01:27:35.377
因为我乖没有做坏事情
Because I'm good and don't do bad things.


803
01:27:38.047 --> 01:27:39.717
你有伤害过小动物吗
Do you often hurt small animals?


804
01:27:39.797 --> 01:27:42.587
没有 我最爱小动物了
No, I love small animals.


805
01:27:43.297 --> 01:27:44.507
你有吃虾子吗
Do you eat shrimp?


806
01:27:44.587 --> 01:27:45.507
有
Yes.


807
01:27:47.337 --> 01:27:49.167
-鱼呢 -也有
- Fish? - Yes.


808
01:27:49.257 --> 01:27:51.297
虾子比鱼好吃
Shrimp tastes better than fish.


809
01:27:55.667 --> 01:27:56.837
小宝
Pao!


810
01:27:58.837 --> 01:27:59.757
小宝
Pao!


811
01:27:59.837 --> 01:28:01.007
小宝你怎么了
Pao, are you all right?


812
01:28:01.377 --> 01:28:03.297
小宝 怎么会这样
Pao, what's happening to you?


813
01:28:04.087 --> 01:28:06.337
-我看看 -怎么会这样
- Let me have a look. - What's happening?


814
01:28:06.417 --> 01:28:08.257
小宝
Pao...


815
01:28:08.337 --> 01:28:10.967
-要不要去医院 -妈妈你先冷静
Should we take him to the hospital? Ma'am, please calm down.


816
01:28:11.047 --> 01:28:12.547
-怎么会这样 -来让尊者看看
Let His Holiness take a look.


817
01:28:12.627 --> 01:28:14.587
-要不要去医院 -让他脸这样 让他躺一下
- Get him to the hospital. - Flip him over.


818
01:28:14.667 --> 01:28:15.667
来 让他躺一下
Let him lie down.


819
01:28:15.757 --> 01:28:16.837
要不要去医院
Get him to the hospital.


820
01:28:18.717 --> 01:28:20.257
可能是吃太快了
Perhaps he ate too quickly.


821
01:28:21.297 --> 01:28:22.257
他没事吗
Is he okay?


822
01:28:22.337 --> 01:28:23.377
-没事 -你干什么
He's fine.


823
01:28:23.587 --> 01:28:24.467
去医院
Hospital.


824
01:28:25.377 --> 01:28:26.257
去医院
Hospital.


825
01:28:27.507 --> 01:28:28.377
去医院
Hospital.


826
01:28:28.797 --> 01:28:31.717
去医院
Hospital. let's go to the hospital.


827
01:28:49.757 --> 01:28:50.917
关门
Close the door.


828
01:28:56.877 --> 01:28:58.627
你刚才药下太多了
You put too much in his food.


829
01:28:59.127 --> 01:29:00.217
我
Me?


830
01:29:00.297 --> 01:29:02.007
-就跟平常一样啊 -他多大
- It was the same as always. - He's a kid.


831
01:29:02.797 --> 01:29:04.587
小孩要那么多份量吗
Kids don't require such a big dose.


832
01:29:13.418 --> 01:29:15.758
刚才尊者治疗的时候你在乱什么
Why did you interrupt His Holiness?


833
01:29:17.168 --> 01:29:19.878
这小孩子出事你给我负全责
You're responsible if anything happens to this kid.


834
01:29:19.968 --> 01:29:21.008
回去
Get out.


835
01:29:41.008 --> 01:29:42.628
你儿子现在
Your son


836
01:29:42.758 --> 01:29:43.758
肺部感染了
has a chest infection.


837
01:29:45.418 --> 01:29:47.628
你看这个阴影的部分
You can see this shadow here.


838
01:29:48.008 --> 01:29:49.468
这有可能是肺积水
It might be pulmonary edema.


839
01:29:50.338 --> 01:29:53.508
然后这些白白的地方有没有
And you see these white areas?


840
01:29:54.168 --> 01:29:56.588
这可能是感染或是气胸
It may be an infection or pneumothorax.


841
01:29:56.668 --> 01:29:57.798
怎么会这样
How is that possible?


842
01:29:57.878 --> 01:29:59.418
他本来还好好的
He was perfectly fine before.


843
01:29:59.508 --> 01:30:00.338
你儿子过往
Does your son


844
01:30:00.418 --> 01:30:02.668
有没有什么慢性疾病史
have any history of chronic illness?


845
01:30:02.758 --> 01:30:05.128
没有 他一直身体都很好
No, he's always been in good health.


846
01:30:05.218 --> 01:30:07.338
只是脑子有点不灵活
He's just not very sharp.


847
01:30:07.418 --> 01:30:09.468
为什么会突然变这样
How could this happen all of a sudden?


848
01:30:10.048 --> 01:30:11.218
真的很奇怪
It's very strange.


849
01:30:11.298 --> 01:30:13.718
这种状况不可能是一天两天造成的
This isn't something that develops in a few days.


850
01:30:14.218 --> 01:30:15.128
尊者
Your Holiness.


851
01:30:15.588 --> 01:30:17.128
尊者大慈大悲
Please have mercy.


852
01:30:17.218 --> 01:30:20.008
求你救救我儿子 求求你
Please save my son. I beg you.


853
01:30:23.168 --> 01:30:25.128
他刚才腹吐黑水
He just vomited black water.


854
01:30:25.918 --> 01:30:28.338
应该是体内有不干净的东西
There's probably something unclean inside him.


855
01:30:30.218 --> 01:30:31.798
我来帮你们解决
I'll take care of it for you.


856
01:32:32.629 --> 01:32:34.339
绝对不能让他死
Don't let him die.


857
01:32:35.129 --> 01:32:36.049
是
Okay.


858
01:32:37.049 --> 01:32:38.799
也绝对不能让他好
But don't let him recover either.


859
01:32:43.129 --> 01:32:45.509
我希望他永远保持这样
I want to keep him like this forever.


860
01:32:46.919 --> 01:32:48.379
能做到吗
Can you do that?


861
01:33:36.379 --> 01:33:38.509
这是我特地帮你做的
I made this especially for you.


862
01:33:38.589 --> 01:33:40.219
来 这边坐

You're on the news every day.


1009
01:57:43.176 --> 01:57:45.267
你一定很开心喔
You must be happy.


1010
01:57:46.767 --> 01:57:49.057
我进来以后做了一次体检
I had a health check when I arrived here.


1011
01:57:51.977 --> 01:57:53.847
这里的医生告诉我
The doctor told me


1012
01:57:55.517 --> 01:57:57.427
我没有得过肺癌
I never had lung cancer.


1013
01:58:02.137 --> 01:58:04.227
这几天我就在想
I started thinking these last few days.


1014
01:58:05.927 --> 01:58:08.517
这世界上是不是有神迹啊
Could it really be a miracle?


1015
01:58:09.597 --> 01:58:12.267
到底是不是林禄和救了我
Did Lin Lu-ho really heal me?


1016
01:58:17.057 --> 01:58:20.267
如果你是得了肺癌突然好起来
If you had lung cancer and suddenly recovered,


1017
01:58:20.347 --> 01:58:22.227
那是神迹
then that's a miracle.


1018
01:58:23.427 --> 01:58:24.927
但要是你根本就没事
But if you never even had it,


1019
01:58:25.017 --> 01:58:26.637
那只是迷信
it's just superstition.


1020
01:58:29.807 --> 01:58:32.137
所以一开始那张X光片
So that X-ray


1021
01:58:33.807 --> 01:58:35.177
不是我的
wasn't mine.


1022
01:58:37.017 --> 01:58:38.477
那双肺是我的
That was my lung.


1023
01:58:41.347 --> 01:58:42.927
你为什么
Why?


1024
01:58:49.597 --> 01:58:52.017
我去医院拿报告那天
The day I got the report at the hospital,


1025
01:58:52.097 --> 01:58:54.267
我大学同学跟我说
my college classmate told me,


1026
01:58:55.517 --> 01:58:58.227
贵卿 你也是个医生
"Kuei-ching, you're a doctor too."


1027
01:58:59.427 --> 01:59:01.597
我突然觉得好羞愧
I suddenly felt so ashamed.


1028
01:59:02.677 --> 01:59:05.227
这些年我到底都在干嘛
What have I been doing all these years?


1029
01:59:06.347 --> 01:59:08.887
都在为你们道上的弟兄
Helping all you gangsters


1030
01:59:09.637 --> 01:59:10.727
拔子弹
extract bullets,


1031
01:59:10.807 --> 01:59:12.307
缝刀伤
stitch up knife wounds.


1032
01:59:13.347 --> 01:59:16.137
我到底是在救人还是在害人
Was I saving people or harming people?


1033
01:59:20.097 --> 01:59:22.557
本来我也只是想替自己积点阴德
I initially wanted to accumulate some good deeds


1034
01:59:22.637 --> 01:59:24.517
骗你去自首
by tricking you to turn yourself in.


1035
01:59:27.767 --> 01:59:30.767
从来没想过事情会变成现在这个样子
I never thought it would turn out like this.


1036
01:59:34.767 --> 01:59:36.557
但后来想一想
But come to think of it,


1037
01:59:37.887 --> 01:59:40.347
这也算一举三得吧
I did kill three birds with one stone.


1038
01:59:41.887 --> 01:59:43.637
我积到了阴德
I accumulated my good deeds,


1039
01:59:44.677 --> 01:59:46.517
你成了大人物
you became infamous,


1040
01:59:48.177 --> 01:59:51.227
社会从此又少了三个罪犯
and society has three less criminals.


1041
01:59:54.387 --> 01:59:56.517
这不是很好吗
Isn't that a good thing?


1042
01:59:59.057 --> 02:00:00.847
幸好我上了你的当
I'm glad I fell for it.


1043
02:00:05.137 --> 02:00:06.597
这个也许就是
Perhaps,


1044
02:00:09.227 --> 02:00:12.977
这个世界上最有价值的谎言
it was the world's most useful lie.


1045
02:00:57.678 --> 02:00:58.558
这个不行
Not this.


1046
02:01:00.558 --> 02:01:02.268
这个也不行
Not this either.


1047
02:01:07.518 --> 02:01:09.228
这两个不行
Not these two.


1048
02:01:10.558 --> 02:01:12.308
-都没了 -没了
- Is that all? - That's everything.


1049
02:01:13.388 --> 02:01:15.178
按规定这些都不行
These are all banned under the rules.


1050
02:01:24.888 --> 02:01:25.888
典狱长
Warden.


1051
02:01:26.518 --> 02:01:27.928
你看一下这个
Take a look at this.


1052
02:01:29.348 --> 02:01:31.018
这个自己用的
This is mine.


1053
02:01:31.098 --> 02:01:33.728
又旧又钝 完全没有杀伤力
It's old, blunt and harmless.


1054
02:01:34.558 --> 02:01:35.888
通融一下
Please allow it.


1055
02:04:35.889 --> 02:04:37.229
再见
Goodbye.


1056
02:04:37.979 --> 02:04:39.229
再见
Goodbye.


1057
02:05:20.929 --> 02:05:23.769
