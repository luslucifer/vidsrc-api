1
00:01:23.897 --> 00:01:25.498
You ready?

2
00:01:51.458 --> 00:01:54.329
- How am I doing?
- Sure you want to know?


3
00:01:54.429 --> 00:01:57.932
"Does your boyfriend
always get his way?"


4
00:01:58.032 --> 00:01:59.434
Yes.

5
00:02:00.134 --> 00:02:02.637
"Does he admit when he's wrong?"

6
00:02:02.737 --> 00:02:04.806
Never.

7
00:02:05.106 --> 00:02:07.225
Does your boyfriend know
how to build a fire with no matches?


8
00:02:07.325 --> 00:02:09.677
Answer is D, who cares.

9
00:02:09.977 --> 00:02:13.448
- A, yes. Very well.
- Sorry, that question's not on here.


10
00:02:13.548 --> 00:02:16.616
- It should be in there.
- Sorry. So you're still zero.


11
00:02:38.039 --> 00:02:41.241
- No!
- Yeah!


12
00:02:42.448 --> 00:02:46.839
<i>Never put your hat on the bed, son
Never put your hat on the bed</i>


13
00:02:46.939 --> 00:02:49.271
<i>Cuz if your hat's on the bed
You might wake up dead</i>


14
00:02:49.371 --> 00:02:52.201
<i>So don't you never put your hat
on the bed</i>


15
00:02:52.301 --> 00:02:56.807
<i>Always keep an edge on your knife, son
Always keep an edge on your knife</i>


16
00:02:56.907 --> 00:02:59.466
<i>Cuz a good sharp edge
Is a man's best hedge</i>


17
00:02:59.566 --> 00:03:01.885
<i>Against the vague uncertainties of life</i>

18
00:03:01.985 --> 00:03:04.183
<i>Yes, a good sharp edge
Is a man's best hedge</i>


19
00:03:04.283 --> 00:03:06.034
<i>Against the uncertain vagaries of life</i>

20
00:03:06.134 --> 00:03:09.203
- Get your hands on the wheel.
- <i>But I never could sharpen no knife</i>


21
00:03:09.303 --> 00:03:11.675
<i>Like the one give the advice</i>

22
00:03:11.775 --> 00:03:16.105
<i>Yodel-aye, yodel-aye, yodel-ooh</i>

23
00:03:16.975 --> 00:03:18.933
<i>Never sell the old .22...</i>

24
00:04:01.555 --> 00:04:03.791
- Hello?
- Hey.


25
00:04:03.891 --> 00:04:06.591
- Just give me a second, will you?
- Yeah, sure.


26
00:04:06.691 --> 00:04:08.763
- How you doin'?
- Good, good, good.


27
00:04:08.863 --> 00:04:10.632
We're reserved under Louis.

28
00:04:10.732 --> 00:04:13.265
- What's the name?
- Alex Louis.


29
00:04:15.102 --> 00:04:17.472
Yeah, sign in here. 
You're ready to go.

30
00:04:17.572 --> 00:04:20.074
Your canoe will be
right down there by the water.


31
00:04:20.174 --> 00:04:23.811
- Bring it back Monday at five.
- That's right, back to work Tuesday.


32
00:04:23.911 --> 00:04:26.878
- Need a map?
- No, I'm good.


33
00:04:27.781 --> 00:04:30.675
- You don't want a map?
- No. No. I know this park well.


34
00:04:30.775 --> 00:04:32.754
It's kinda end of the season, right?

35
00:04:32.854 --> 00:04:35.982
I mean, the weather can change on you...
just turn on a dime.


36
00:04:36.082 --> 00:04:39.160
- Less people.
- Amen to that.


37
00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:42.981
You mind me askin' you, Mr. No Map,
where you're headed?


38
00:04:43.081 --> 00:04:45.700
Blackfoot Trail.
I can't wait to show her.


39
00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:47.636
It's her first time here.
It's gonna be awesome.


40
00:04:48.336 --> 00:04:50.438
I got some bad news for you,
I'm really sorry about this


41
00:04:50.538 --> 00:04:52.490
but Blackfoot Trail's
closed for the season.


42
00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:54.175
- Why?
- Had to.


43
00:04:54.275 --> 00:04:56.605
I mean, so many yahoos, you know,

44
00:04:56.705 --> 00:05:00.781
trampin' around there, disrespecting
everything. This is a treasured site.


45
00:05:00.881 --> 00:05:05.186
I don't have to tell you I guess. And Parks
and Recreation want to keep it that way.


46
00:05:05.286 --> 00:05:09.424
Look, going to Blackfoot Trail
is kinda the whole point of this trip.


47
00:05:09.824 --> 00:05:13.361
It's 500 bucks
if you're caught up there. Each.


48
00:05:13.461 --> 00:05:17.295
That'll be a 1000 bucks
expensive little camping trip.


49
00:05:18.231 --> 00:05:19.801
Alright.

50
00:05:19.901 --> 00:05:21.876
- Jenn, you ready?
- Yeah.


51
00:05:21.976 --> 00:05:26.347
Hang on. Hey, rodeo, here's your
medical kit and there's a whistle in there,


52
00:05:26.447 --> 00:05:29.511
try to bring that back
and I'll try not to charge you.


53
00:05:29.711 --> 00:05:32.095
Thousand bucks?

54
00:05:32.195 --> 00:05:34.446
You're pretty good.

55
00:05:36.016 --> 00:05:40.018
- Bye. You have a nice trip.
- Thanks.


56
00:05:58.472 --> 00:06:01.008
- Really?
- Last one.


57
00:06:01.108 --> 00:06:03.311
- Come on, babe.
- No, this is really important.


58
00:06:03.411 --> 00:06:07.348
You know, we've been waiting
forever for this. I'm... just...


59
00:06:07.448 --> 00:06:10.349
They're all important.
Can't wait till we get back?


60
00:06:12.285 --> 00:06:14.264
Okay, I'm done. Okay?

61
00:06:14.364 --> 00:06:17.119
- Alright. I don't believe you, but...
- Well, putting it away, so it's...


62
00:06:17.219 --> 00:06:20.595
Hang on, hang on. Let's take a picture.
Just to mark the departure.


63
00:06:20.695 --> 00:06:24.262
- Put it to good use, right?
- Fine. Okay.


64
00:06:24.562 --> 00:06:26.600
Ready?

65
00:06:31.304 --> 00:06:33.569
- Good.
- Yeah. One of us looks good.


66
00:06:33.669 --> 00:06:35.740
Alright.

67
00:07:13.546 --> 00:07:16.048
- Hey, have a good one.
- Thanks a lot.


68
00:08:30.323 --> 00:08:32.026
- Fuck!
- You okay?


69
00:08:32.126 --> 00:08:35.429
Fuck, fuck that...
fuckin' hurt like a bitch.


70
00:08:35.529 --> 00:08:37.599
You sure you're okay?

71
00:08:37.699 --> 00:08:40.733
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, 
I'll just walk it off.

72
00:08:42.669 --> 00:08:45.070
This is for you.

73
00:08:46.306 --> 00:08:50.062
You look scared anyway. Feel safe.

74
00:08:50.376 --> 00:08:52.777
I probably won't need it.

75
00:08:53.380 --> 00:08:56.028
Got it taken care of already.

76
00:08:59.719 --> 00:09:02.465
- Look what I got.
- When did you get that?


77
00:09:02.565 --> 00:09:05.526
- I got it a few days ago.
- You're not gonna need it.


78
00:09:05.626 --> 00:09:08.299
Do you wanna have a good time on this trip
or do you want me to be freaking out?


79
00:09:08.609 --> 00:09:12.166
- This is what makes me feel safe.
- Okay. Okay.


80
00:09:12.266 --> 00:09:16.437
Well, if you can have it, it's useless
in your bag. Give it to me. Thanks.


81
00:09:16.537 --> 00:09:19.106
Just gonna clip it
to your belt, alright?


82
00:09:19.206 --> 00:09:21.740
And you're not gonna need it.

83
00:09:22.575 --> 00:09:24.709
Bear spray.

84
00:09:25.912 --> 00:09:27.281
Wonder what other goodies
you have in there.


85
00:09:27.381 --> 00:09:28.483
- Nothin'.
- Let's see.


86
00:09:28.583 --> 00:09:31.817
I don't have anything in there.
Hey, there's nothing.


87
00:09:33.286 --> 00:09:35.089
- Come on.
- What?


88
00:09:35.189 --> 00:09:39.027
- Seriously? This is a road flare.
- I know what it is.


89
00:09:39.127 --> 00:09:42.295
Yeah. This is for when your car
breaks down on the side of the highway.


90
00:09:42.395 --> 00:09:45.132
You know this. 
I know you know this.

91
00:09:45.232 --> 00:09:47.468
Jenn, come on, if you wanted a flare,
I could've picked up a pen flare.


92
00:09:47.568 --> 00:09:50.401
They sell them at any camping store.

93
00:09:52.472 --> 00:09:55.173
- Here's your flare.
- Thank you.


94
00:09:57.110 --> 00:09:59.280
- You ready?
- Think so.


95
00:09:59.380 --> 00:10:01.413
Okay.

96
00:10:03.516 --> 00:10:05.766
Oh, my God.

97
00:10:08.755 --> 00:10:10.797
- You good?
- Yes.


98
00:10:36.315 --> 00:10:38.686
What, sorry, what?

99
00:10:40.438 --> 00:10:44.288
Jenn, you know we'd be lucky to see
anything bigger than a chipmunk, right?


100
00:11:06.513 --> 00:11:08.680
- Hi.
- Hey.


101
00:11:32.701 --> 00:11:34.538
No!

102
00:11:38.478 --> 00:11:41.249
Hey, look at that. That's cute.

103
00:11:41.649 --> 00:11:43.217
We should take it.

104
00:11:43.317 --> 00:11:45.850
- Here's a good spot.
- Yeah.


105
00:11:48.422 --> 00:11:50.655
Counselor, back up, please.

106
00:12:08.608 --> 00:12:11.579
- Tryin' to turn me on right now?
- Is it working?


107
00:12:11.679 --> 00:12:14.946
Oh, yeah. It's pretty hot.

108
00:12:15.448 --> 00:12:17.549
Speaking of...

109
00:12:20.920 --> 00:12:22.840
do you remember the little
swimming hole we walked by?


110
00:12:22.940 --> 00:12:27.258
- Nope, I don't. No.
- Really?


111
00:12:28.061 --> 00:12:30.097
- You said you would.
- I didn't say that.


112
00:12:30.197 --> 00:12:31.815
- Yes, you did.
- I said maybe.


113
00:12:31.915 --> 00:12:35.203
No, no, no. You said yes.
Come on, babes.


114
00:12:35.303 --> 00:12:38.639
No. It's like when you say, "Do you
want to order Chinese food tonight?"


115
00:12:38.739 --> 00:12:41.876
And I go, "Maybe,"
and then we get Italian.


116
00:12:42.076 --> 00:12:43.377
It's like that.

117
00:12:43.477 --> 00:12:46.897
- I'm gonna be all lonely by myself.
- Well, no one's making you do this.


118
00:12:46.997 --> 00:12:48.480
Stop it!

119
00:12:52.452 --> 00:12:56.020
Oh, my God, please. 
What if there's...

120
00:12:57.590 --> 00:13:00.157
Don't leave me hangin', babe.

121
00:13:01.427 --> 00:13:03.961
Okay, okay. Fine.

122
00:13:18.145 --> 00:13:19.546
- You ready?
- No.


123
00:13:19.646 --> 00:13:21.698
Come on.

124
00:13:26.652 --> 00:13:30.089
5... 4... 3, 2, 1!

125
00:13:36.062 --> 00:13:38.838
- Jenn, come on!
- No!


126
00:13:38.938 --> 00:13:40.934
It's freezing.

127
00:13:51.211 --> 00:13:53.514
I'm gonna get some more wood
before it gets too dark.


128
00:13:53.614 --> 00:13:57.284
- Okay, I'll come help you.
- No, no, I'll be back in a second.


129
00:13:57.384 --> 00:13:59.817
Okay. Yeah.

130
00:14:42.428 --> 00:14:43.789
Hello.

131
00:15:04.684 --> 00:15:06.842
How long have you been...

132
00:15:06.942 --> 00:15:09.153
At this time...

133
00:15:10.556 --> 00:15:12.490
- What?
- No, I mean...


134
00:15:17.304 --> 00:15:19.526
- Really?
- Yeah.


135
00:15:35.381 --> 00:15:38.452
Hey. This is Alex. 
Alex this is Brad.

136
00:15:38.552 --> 00:15:40.754
- Brad, right?
- Yeah. Hi, how are you?


137
00:15:40.854 --> 00:15:43.220
I'm good. Thanks.

138
00:15:43.823 --> 00:15:46.659
- Were you just walkin' by or...
- Oh, yeah, I was comin' up the trail


139
00:15:46.759 --> 00:15:49.430
and I ran into your friend here
and she invited me over for a chat.


140
00:15:49.530 --> 00:15:53.567
Yeah. Turns out that he also
kind of grew up in a park, the woods.


141
00:15:53.667 --> 00:15:57.288
And he's got a ton of fish so I thought
maybe we could all have dinner tonight.


142
00:15:57.388 --> 00:16:01.442
Couldn't eat 'em all if I wanted to.
I mean, I could try, but...


143
00:16:01.542 --> 00:16:03.444
I just gotta put a shirt on, alright?

144
00:16:03.544 --> 00:16:05.943
- Okay.
- Yeah.


145
00:16:06.579 --> 00:16:09.013
So you were sayin'...

146
00:16:15.321 --> 00:16:17.024
- Jenn?
- Yeah?


147
00:16:17.124 --> 00:16:20.724
- Would you come help me here for a sec?
- Sure.


148
00:16:23.697 --> 00:16:25.766
- What's up?
- Come on in.


149
00:16:25.866 --> 00:16:27.932
Okay.

150
00:16:29.635 --> 00:16:33.073
- What's goin' on?
- You comfortable with this?


151
00:16:33.173 --> 00:16:37.111
- What? Him?
- Yeah, I don't know, this guy could be...


152
00:16:37.211 --> 00:16:39.613
I was talkin' to him for, like,

153
00:16:39.713 --> 00:16:43.096
- He's great. Well, he's a liar.
- Why is he a liar?


154
00:16:43.196 --> 00:16:45.580
Woods? What, the woods of Ireland?

155
00:16:45.680 --> 00:16:48.466
- Come on, come on.
- What does that have to do with anything?


156
00:16:50.191 --> 00:16:51.729
Did you invite him
or he invited himself?


157
00:16:51.829 --> 00:16:53.824
I did.

158
00:16:56.097 --> 00:16:58.534
- You want me to uninvite him?
- No, we can't do that.


159
00:16:58.634 --> 00:17:02.732
- I can do that. It'd be really awkward.
- You'd never be able to do that. I know you.


160
00:17:03.304 --> 00:17:06.540
- What do you need help with?
- I obviously don't need help.


161
00:17:06.640 --> 00:17:10.197
I guess it wasn't obvious because...
you told me to come in here.


162
00:17:12.645 --> 00:17:14.882
You know, I don't wanna
bother you all, so...


163
00:17:14.982 --> 00:17:17.751
Probably better if I just be
on my way and... have a nice trip.


164
00:17:17.851 --> 00:17:20.854
- No, no, no. Stay.
- No, no, no. You're gonna stay...


165
00:17:20.954 --> 00:17:23.156
and you're gonna have
some dinner with us.


166
00:17:23.256 --> 00:17:24.425
- Yeah?
- Of course.


167
00:17:24.525 --> 00:17:27.892
It was just... it was just
a misunderstanding, that's all.


168
00:17:29.762 --> 00:17:31.956
Well, alright, then. Let's do it.

169
00:17:51.884 --> 00:17:53.535
You wanted fish.

170
00:18:00.693 --> 00:18:02.821
I thought it was illegal
to fish these lakes.


171
00:18:05.197 --> 00:18:06.800
Grandfather law.

172
00:18:07.200 --> 00:18:10.738
So that's when... like an old law
applies to existing situations


173
00:18:10.838 --> 00:18:12.873
but then a new one
applies to all the future ones?


174
00:18:12.973 --> 00:18:17.044
- I know what a grandfather law is.
- Okay. Sorry.


175
00:18:17.344 --> 00:18:20.353
- Lawyer.
- Yeah, I got that.


176
00:18:23.115 --> 00:18:26.218
What about you, Alex? 
What do you do?

177
00:18:28.320 --> 00:18:30.190
Well... right now I'm...

178
00:18:30.290 --> 00:18:33.962
My buddy has a landscaping business
so I'm... I'm working with him.


179
00:18:35.162 --> 00:18:37.362
Are you Mexican?

180
00:18:37.462 --> 00:18:39.300
I didn't mean anything by that.

181
00:18:39.400 --> 00:18:42.903
I just thought that's a job
that the Mexicans do here.


182
00:18:43.003 --> 00:18:44.972
Well, what he does is pretty high end.

183
00:18:45.072 --> 00:18:48.175
And actually he's starting
a new company soon, so...


184
00:18:48.275 --> 00:18:50.744
It's great. He's really talented.

185
00:18:50.844 --> 00:18:53.520
Well done you, Alex.

186
00:18:58.284 --> 00:19:00.888
- Trout looks good.
- It does, right?


187
00:19:00.988 --> 00:19:05.826
Yeah, and lucky for me if I cannot find
any fish I got a license to kill a deer.


188
00:19:05.926 --> 00:19:06.906
Oh, cool.

189
00:19:07.006 --> 00:19:10.664
Fuck me tryin' to get a license
for that these days.


190
00:19:10.764 --> 00:19:13.200
You guys have anything
we can cook for sides with these?


191
00:19:13.300 --> 00:19:15.483
Yeah, you know, I could...

192
00:19:15.583 --> 00:19:19.086
- Maybe fry the veggies or potatoes?
- Yeah, veggies sound good.


193
00:19:19.186 --> 00:19:21.709
- Okay.
- Well, I say the potatoes.


194
00:19:22.109 --> 00:19:24.211
Why don't we do both?

195
00:19:24.311 --> 00:19:26.547
You know, Alex...

196
00:19:26.747 --> 00:19:29.224
let's eat the potatoes.

197
00:19:30.382 --> 00:19:32.475
I'll get 'em.

198
00:19:42.128 --> 00:19:43.931
So you're Irish?

199
00:19:44.231 --> 00:19:47.768
- County Tipperary.
- Is that near Mexico?


200
00:19:47.868 --> 00:19:51.438
That's a good one.
Actually south of Dublin.


201
00:19:51.538 --> 00:19:54.141
What do you do
for a livin' out here?

202
00:19:54.241 --> 00:19:58.178
I give backcountry Eco tours
to tourists that want...


203
00:19:58.278 --> 00:20:00.349
you know, like a deeper experience
of the wilderness you know,


204
00:20:00.449 --> 00:20:03.796
somethin' more than campin'
in a parking lot.


205
00:20:03.896 --> 00:20:05.102
Yeah? That's cool.

206
00:20:05.202 --> 00:20:08.923
I mean, you and Jenn are doin' it
so it must be cool, right?


207
00:20:09.623 --> 00:20:11.368
How much would somethin' like that cost?

208
00:20:13.293 --> 00:20:15.659
I wouldn't know.

209
00:20:16.696 --> 00:20:18.688
You don't know how much it costs?

210
00:20:21.033 --> 00:20:24.535
I only know how
much they pay me, Alex.

211
00:20:30.834 --> 00:20:35.123
Okay, so they're already parboiled, we just
need to put 'em on for a few minutes.


212
00:20:36.382 --> 00:20:37.575
Hang on.

213
00:20:46.659 --> 00:20:48.272
Oh, my...

214
00:20:51.564 --> 00:20:53.033
I'm sorry.

215
00:20:56.402 --> 00:20:59.360
Alright, then.
Let's see what we've got here.


216
00:21:01.007 --> 00:21:03.740
- I can do that.
- No, I got it.


217
00:21:04.310 --> 00:21:06.146
This smells delicious.

218
00:21:06.246 --> 00:21:10.618
Yeah. There's, garlic, rosemary
and there's some thyme.


219
00:21:11.218 --> 00:21:14.754
- You're a luck man, Alex.
- I know.


220
00:21:15.654 --> 00:21:16.990
So what are your plans?

221
00:21:17.090 --> 00:21:20.160
You guys gonna do some amazing hikes,
see some spots, what?


222
00:21:20.425 --> 00:21:23.597
- I think we can...
- You know, we live really hectic lives


223
00:21:23.697 --> 00:21:27.568
so I think we're just gonna... relax.
Stay around here for a few days.


224
00:21:27.868 --> 00:21:30.571
- Yep.
- Alright.


225
00:21:30.671 --> 00:21:33.905
You're really grabbin' life
by the balls, Alex, aren't ya?


226
00:21:35.774 --> 00:21:37.363
I'm just sayin'.

227
00:21:37.463 --> 00:21:40.748
You know, if... if I had a beautiful
woman here like Jenn, I'd...


228
00:21:41.048 --> 00:21:45.352
wanna take her to some spots that
weren't on the... the tourist trail, right?


229
00:21:45.452 --> 00:21:47.287
As a matter of fact, Jenn...

230
00:21:47.387 --> 00:21:52.426
there is this absolutely gorgeous
waterfall, I mean, really beautiful.


231
00:21:52.526 --> 00:21:55.496
- You've probably been there, right, Alex?
- Yeah, totally.


232
00:21:55.596 --> 00:21:59.833
Then you know which side
of the waterfall to climb down on.


233
00:22:00.433 --> 00:22:02.747
The right side.

234
00:22:04.103 --> 00:22:06.194
Right side.

235
00:22:07.807 --> 00:22:11.271
- Good guess, Alex.
- I wasn't guessing.


236
00:22:11.371 --> 00:22:14.081
You see these tourists are always
tryin' to go down the left side.


237
00:22:14.181 --> 00:22:16.950
I mean, they think it's safer.
Fuckin' idiots!


238
00:22:17.050 --> 00:22:19.086
There's also a...

239
00:22:19.186 --> 00:22:21.588
it's frozen... frozen arrow.

240
00:22:21.688 --> 00:22:24.157
In Blackfoot Trail.

241
00:22:24.257 --> 00:22:26.327
I mean, if it were me...

242
00:22:26.827 --> 00:22:30.030
I'd want to take
you to all those spots.

243
00:22:30.130 --> 00:22:32.799
You sure you don't need a guide?

244
00:22:32.899 --> 00:22:35.482
I already have one.

245
00:22:35.901 --> 00:22:37.925
Let's eat.

246
00:22:55.858 --> 00:22:57.751
Alright.

247
00:22:58.058 --> 00:23:01.563
- That was fun.
- Yeah, thanks for the fish.


248
00:23:05.597 --> 00:23:07.534
Alright.

249
00:23:07.634 --> 00:23:10.303
Well, now, I'm ready. Cheers.

250
00:23:10.403 --> 00:23:12.672
Goodnight.

251
00:23:12.772 --> 00:23:15.207
Say, Alex...

252
00:23:15.407 --> 00:23:17.644
you know, earlier...

253
00:23:17.744 --> 00:23:19.913
you said something.

254
00:23:20.013 --> 00:23:22.457
It was a misunderstanding.

255
00:23:23.783 --> 00:23:26.018
You wanna explain that to me?

256
00:23:26.130 --> 00:23:29.055
- It was nothing.
- Come on, he's a big boy.


257
00:23:29.155 --> 00:23:31.324
Let him answer.

258
00:23:31.424 --> 00:23:34.194
It's just a funny thing to say.

259
00:23:34.294 --> 00:23:35.862
What'd you mean by it?

260
00:23:35.962 --> 00:23:38.131
I'm not sure I understand
what you're getting at.


261
00:23:38.231 --> 00:23:40.898
Oh, yes, you do.

262
00:23:41.433 --> 00:23:45.652
What... was the misunderstanding?

263
00:23:52.011 --> 00:23:54.314
Is it important?

264
00:23:54.414 --> 00:23:56.316
I won't be fuckin' askin' if it wasn't.

265
00:23:56.416 --> 00:23:58.883
- It's on me, okay. I was just...
- Jenn.


266
00:24:04.456 --> 00:24:07.227
Well, I come back here...

267
00:24:07.327 --> 00:24:10.552
and I find my girlfriend
talkin' to this guy...


268
00:24:11.597 --> 00:24:13.869
and I'm not sure it's a good idea.

269
00:24:16.862 --> 00:24:18.872
That's all.

270
00:24:18.972 --> 00:24:21.637
I mean, I don't know you.

271
00:24:22.174 --> 00:24:25.236
So what was the misunderstanding?

272
00:24:28.781 --> 00:24:31.652
You can be some nut.

273
00:24:32.551 --> 00:24:35.335
She convinced me otherwise.

274
00:24:39.124 --> 00:24:41.885
Like I said, Alex...

275
00:24:45.297 --> 00:24:47.844
you're a lucky guy.

276
00:24:51.136 --> 00:24:52.906
I'm sorry.

277
00:24:53.006 --> 00:24:55.111
Jenn, I...

278
00:24:55.708 --> 00:24:58.124
- I think you dropped something.
- I got it.


279
00:25:00.779 --> 00:25:02.846
Thanks.

280
00:25:13.760 --> 00:25:16.162
Why don't you invite him to the house
next time. That'd be fun.


281
00:25:16.262 --> 00:25:18.846
I said I'm sorry.

282
00:25:20.366 --> 00:25:22.569
- Should we worry about him?
- What's that?


283
00:25:22.669 --> 00:25:26.573
Should we worry about him
comin' back, or I don't know...


284
00:25:27.085 --> 00:25:30.040
No, he's just... he's just weird.

285
00:25:33.212 --> 00:25:35.564
But I'm bringing my axe.
And I'm gonna sleep with it


286
00:25:35.664 --> 00:25:40.386
in case your fuckin' dinner guest wants
to come back for... dessert or something.


287
00:25:40.486 --> 00:25:42.919
You're mad.

288
00:25:44.756 --> 00:25:47.994
- Jenn, I don't understand you.
- What?


289
00:25:48.094 --> 00:25:52.299
You invite a total stranger to eat dinner
with us our first night on this trip.


290
00:25:52.399 --> 00:25:56.169
Okay, I... I didn't know what to do.

291
00:25:56.269 --> 00:25:59.512
I was just being kind.

292
00:26:00.640 --> 00:26:02.242
I'm sorry.

293
00:26:02.642 --> 00:26:06.645
Just stay here. If he turns around
and comes back, you yell for me.


294
00:26:45.751 --> 00:26:47.754
Oh, my God.

295
00:26:47.854 --> 00:26:50.426
That smells amazing.

296
00:26:53.125 --> 00:26:55.142
Thank you.

297
00:26:57.462 --> 00:27:00.100
Remember the survey that we took
on the way over here?


298
00:27:00.200 --> 00:27:01.705
The first question was about...

299
00:27:01.805 --> 00:27:04.604
how many times your boyfriend
has made breakfast in bed for you?


300
00:27:04.704 --> 00:27:05.905
- Remember that?
- Really?


301
00:27:06.005 --> 00:27:09.610
Yeah, and I had to write zero. I guess
I'll have to change that from zero to one.


302
00:27:10.110 --> 00:27:11.611
One?

303
00:27:11.711 --> 00:27:14.181
- Was it really zero?
- Yeah.


304
00:27:14.281 --> 00:27:16.016
- You embarrassed?
- Little bit.


305
00:27:16.116 --> 00:27:19.383
- This isn't even in bed...
- Believe me this counts.


306
00:27:21.620 --> 00:27:23.570
Thank you.

307
00:27:26.926 --> 00:27:29.362
What is it about this place
that's so amazing?


308
00:27:29.462 --> 00:27:33.299
- Blackfoot Trail?
- Yeah. Why's it called that anyway?


309
00:27:33.399 --> 00:27:35.468
The local tribes called it that
because when the trail ends


310
00:27:35.568 --> 00:27:40.206
it circles around this really small lake.
And the earth around the lake is black.


311
00:27:40.306 --> 00:27:42.684
So when they hunted they followed
animal tracks in the black earth


312
00:27:42.784 --> 00:27:44.711
and called it Blackfoot Trail.

313
00:27:44.811 --> 00:27:47.780
So what's the lake called?

314
00:27:47.880 --> 00:27:50.216
- I don't know.
- Seriously?


315
00:27:50.316 --> 00:27:52.853
No, no, no, picture it,
picture it, picture it, alright?


316
00:27:52.953 --> 00:27:55.155
You come up this steep rocky trail

317
00:27:55.255 --> 00:28:00.560
and then all of a sudden it levels off
and it's this beautiful, pristine lake.


318
00:28:00.660 --> 00:28:04.965
When I was a kid this was my favorite
place in the whole world.


319
00:28:05.565 --> 00:28:07.267
Now it looks so out of place
that high up.


320
00:28:07.367 --> 00:28:10.670
It's like out of some fantasy novel
or something, you know.


321
00:28:10.770 --> 00:28:13.073
Yeah, I have a feeling your geeky side
is about to come out.


322
00:28:13.173 --> 00:28:14.875
- What geeky side?
- What geeky side?


323
00:28:14.975 --> 00:28:17.177
The one that made me watch
"Legend" 4 times.


324
00:28:17.277 --> 00:28:19.346
"Just wait for the part where Tom Cruise
is waiting by the lake


325
00:28:19.446 --> 00:28:20.714
for the big white unicorn to come out."

326
00:28:20.814 --> 00:28:22.615
It's an awesome scene.
What are you talking about?


327
00:28:22.715 --> 00:28:25.460
Yeah, indeed.

328
00:28:31.990 --> 00:28:33.994
All good?

329
00:28:34.559 --> 00:28:36.591
Yeah.

330
00:28:50.976 --> 00:28:53.880
Of course, you're going that way.

331
00:28:53.980 --> 00:28:56.213
This is the way.

332
00:29:49.468 --> 00:29:50.807
Fuck.

333
00:30:42.120 --> 00:30:44.166
Fuck.

334
00:30:50.497 --> 00:30:52.490
Let me see it.

335
00:30:57.068 --> 00:30:59.803
Alex, it's disgusting.

336
00:31:02.408 --> 00:31:04.967
It's pretty bad.

337
00:31:23.228 --> 00:31:25.385
- Oh, fuck!
- Are you ready?


338
00:31:29.468 --> 00:31:31.151
Sorry.

339
00:31:32.304 --> 00:31:34.374
That's not good.

340
00:31:35.374 --> 00:31:39.276
- To think you're laughing about it.
- Oh, why not?


341
00:31:42.448 --> 00:31:45.918
Just don't touch the toe. Don't touch...
Here, let me... let me finish it.


342
00:31:46.018 --> 00:31:48.656
- It looks... it looks okay.
- It looks terrible.


343
00:31:50.156 --> 00:31:54.057
- What you got there?
- You could use some new socks.


344
00:31:54.493 --> 00:31:58.428
- Stupid place.
- Oh, thanks, babes.


345
00:31:58.697 --> 00:32:00.763
Okay.

346
00:32:58.490 --> 00:33:00.657
Alex.

347
00:33:00.792 --> 00:33:02.959
Alex.

348
00:33:12.438 --> 00:33:15.540
Alex. Alex.

349
00:33:15.640 --> 00:33:18.745
Alex, get up. Listen.

350
00:33:18.845 --> 00:33:20.980
- What?
- Just listen. What is that?


351
00:33:21.080 --> 00:33:23.179
What?

352
00:33:24.082 --> 00:33:27.553
- Someone's throwing shit at our tent.
- What?


353
00:33:27.653 --> 00:33:30.056
Just listen.

354
00:33:30.156 --> 00:33:33.059
- What is that?
- That?


355
00:33:33.159 --> 00:33:34.794
Oh, that's acorns.

356
00:33:34.894 --> 00:33:39.663
Just fallin' from the trees on our tent.
It's fine. Just go back to sleep.


357
00:33:51.643 --> 00:33:54.171
That's not an acorn.

358
00:33:57.249 --> 00:33:59.318
What is it?

359
00:33:59.618 --> 00:34:04.209
- Do you think it's him?
- Let's just listen for a bit, okay?


360
00:34:18.838 --> 00:34:20.740
Fuck! I swear,
now you got me all paranoid.


361
00:34:20.840 --> 00:34:23.309
Maybe he came back. He's throwing stones
at the tent or something stupid.


362
00:34:23.409 --> 00:34:26.152
No, no, no, it could be anything.

363
00:34:30.749 --> 00:34:33.983
Whatever it is, it stopped.

364
00:34:35.387 --> 00:34:38.928
So, let's just go back to sleep,
okay? It's fine.


365
00:34:39.257 --> 00:34:41.291
It stopped.

366
00:35:35.781 --> 00:35:38.417
That wasn't there last night, was it?

367
00:35:38.517 --> 00:35:40.220
No.

368
00:35:40.320 --> 00:35:43.155
I wanna go home.
I don't wanna be here anymore.


369
00:35:43.255 --> 00:35:47.507
- Jenn, come on, don't overreact, okay?
- An acorn did that?


370
00:35:48.995 --> 00:35:52.598
Come on, I've waited
so long for this trip.


371
00:35:52.698 --> 00:35:56.289
We're here and when you get there,

372
00:35:56.389 --> 00:35:58.632
you'll love it.

373
00:36:00.105 --> 00:36:02.260
I promise.

374
00:36:03.741 --> 00:36:05.611
Yeah, okay.

375
00:36:05.711 --> 00:36:08.048
- Can you do this for me?
- Yes.


376
00:36:08.748 --> 00:36:11.783
- Thank you.
- Alright.


377
00:36:16.923 --> 00:36:20.493
She's a very good artist. I have no idea
why you don't give her a chance.


378
00:36:20.593 --> 00:36:22.795
- What do you mean?
- And she's a great performer.


379
00:36:22.895 --> 00:36:24.931
You know, it's just not my thing.

380
00:36:25.031 --> 00:36:27.166
- I don't...
- Oh, hey.


381
00:36:27.266 --> 00:36:29.559
Hang on a second.

382
00:36:32.971 --> 00:36:34.202
What?

383
00:36:39.444 --> 00:36:41.899
This is wintergreen.

384
00:36:42.548 --> 00:36:44.951
And you can eat this.

385
00:36:48.118 --> 00:36:49.655
Tastes like spearmint gum.

386
00:36:49.755 --> 00:36:50.590
- You want some?
- No.


387
00:36:50.690 --> 00:36:54.023
- You sure?
- Yes. An animal probably peed on it.


388
00:36:54.560 --> 00:36:56.726
Your loss.

389
00:36:58.997 --> 00:37:01.264
What's that smell?

390
00:37:12.644 --> 00:37:14.777
It's nothin'.

391
00:37:23.922 --> 00:37:24.925
Babe.

392
00:37:43.341 --> 00:37:45.413
Oh, my God. Alex!

393
00:37:48.780 --> 00:37:51.313
I mean, what...

394
00:37:58.189 --> 00:38:00.256
No.

395
00:38:38.596 --> 00:38:41.564
Oh, God. Get off me.

396
00:38:45.137 --> 00:38:47.970
Oh, my God.

397
00:38:49.642 --> 00:38:51.477
I found it!

398
00:38:51.577 --> 00:38:53.843
Thank God!

399
00:39:07.592 --> 00:39:10.291
What is so funny?

400
00:39:10.730 --> 00:39:13.165
Looks like you have a little piece
of poo on your face.


401
00:39:13.265 --> 00:39:17.289
- Yeah, 'cause I just fell down on it.
- You fell? You okay?


402
00:39:17.389 --> 00:39:20.072
I'm fine. Shouldn't we be
saving that or something?


403
00:39:20.172 --> 00:39:24.073
No, we've got plenty of water
at the lake. I brought the drops.


404
00:39:24.173 --> 00:39:26.241
Here.

405
00:39:29.013 --> 00:39:31.517
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.


406
00:39:31.617 --> 00:39:34.053
- This is it?
- Yeah, just up there.


407
00:39:34.153 --> 00:39:36.489
It's a real bitch
to get up, isn't it?

408
00:39:36.589 --> 00:39:39.992
I know. But it's worth it.

409
00:39:40.092 --> 00:39:41.827
- Alright.
- Come on!


410
00:39:41.927 --> 00:39:44.954
- I'm comin'.
- Come on!


411
00:39:53.371 --> 00:39:55.474
Come on!

412
00:40:23.368 --> 00:40:25.334
Alex...

413
00:40:34.379 --> 00:40:36.582
Where's the lake?

414
00:40:36.682 --> 00:40:38.850
I can't believe this.

415
00:40:38.950 --> 00:40:42.104
- Alex... This can't be it, right?
- I don't... I don't understand.


416
00:40:42.204 --> 00:40:45.324
Fuck! I was sure. I was, like,
a fucking 100% sure. I was...


417
00:40:45.424 --> 00:40:47.561
- Can you look at me, please?
- Just let me think. Just let me think.


418
00:40:47.661 --> 00:40:49.400
Let me think. Let me think.

419
00:40:50.829 --> 00:40:54.764
Fuck! God damn it!
What the fuck is this?


420
00:40:58.203 --> 00:41:00.673
Please tell me you have
a map in your bag.


421
00:41:00.773 --> 00:41:03.709
- I never needed a map.
- Oh, we do now.


422
00:41:03.809 --> 00:41:06.344
I don't have one.

423
00:41:06.744 --> 00:41:09.281
- So, then, where are we?
- I obviously don't know, right?


424
00:41:09.381 --> 00:41:12.485
But you said that you've done this,
like, so many times...


425
00:41:12.585 --> 00:41:14.854
You said it was, like,
a few years ago you did this.


426
00:41:14.954 --> 00:41:16.856
Yeah, I've been to the park
a bunch of times!


427
00:41:16.956 --> 00:41:19.925
The trail, Alex.
You said you did the trail.


428
00:41:20.325 --> 00:41:22.060
Yeah.

429
00:41:22.160 --> 00:41:24.794
Not since high school, but...

430
00:41:35.206 --> 00:41:38.309
- It's not...
- I put it here. I...


431
00:41:38.409 --> 00:41:40.247
I put it right here.

432
00:41:44.749 --> 00:41:46.756
It's not...

433
00:41:49.120 --> 00:41:51.991
- I took it out.
- What?


434
00:41:52.091 --> 00:41:56.061
Your phone. I took it out.

435
00:41:56.161 --> 00:41:58.430
Where is it?

436
00:41:58.530 --> 00:42:01.066
- In the car.
- Why would you do that?


437
00:42:01.166 --> 00:42:05.504
I didn't want you on that thing
the whole time when we're here.


438
00:42:05.604 --> 00:42:09.809
I didn't reach for that once. I wanted
to bring it in case we needed it.


439
00:42:09.909 --> 00:42:12.278
Which we do.

440
00:42:12.378 --> 00:42:16.479
- You can't get reception out here anyway...
- Well, I would have loved to try.


441
00:42:29.394 --> 00:42:32.798
When was the last time
you were sure of where you were?


442
00:42:32.898 --> 00:42:37.435
- I was sure the whole time.
- No. Think, Alex.


443
00:42:37.535 --> 00:42:39.902
When was it?

444
00:42:41.272 --> 00:42:43.308
I don't...

445
00:42:43.708 --> 00:42:47.704
- Maybe the fork in the trail
- The first one, the second one?


446
00:42:53.584 --> 00:42:55.618
First one.

447
00:42:56.120 --> 00:42:58.891
- Are you serious?
- Just... come on, don't freak out.


448
00:42:58.991 --> 00:43:00.793
I don't want to be
freaking out right now.


449
00:43:00.893 --> 00:43:03.963
But we are in the middle
of fucking nowhere.


450
00:43:04.063 --> 00:43:07.316
We don't have anything. We don't have
a map. We don't have a cell phone.


451
00:43:07.416 --> 00:43:10.769
We don't have anything.
We haven't seen anyone in so long!


452
00:43:10.869 --> 00:43:12.771
- This is... it's okay.
- Why...


453
00:43:12.871 --> 00:43:15.908
Why did we have to come so far
on my first camping trip?


454
00:43:16.008 --> 00:43:17.843
Why couldn't it just have been
a regular trip?


455
00:43:18.143 --> 00:43:20.446
- Why do you always have to show off?
- I'm not showing off...


456
00:43:20.546 --> 00:43:23.007
- Why do you always try to impress me?
- I'm not trying to impress you.


457
00:43:23.107 --> 00:43:24.583
'Cause I'm not fucking impressed
right now!


458
00:43:24.683 --> 00:43:26.652
Good!

459
00:43:26.752 --> 00:43:30.189
- I'm not trying to fucking impress you!
- Alex, could we be honest for a second?


460
00:43:30.289 --> 00:43:33.555
I'd love to be honest for once.

461
00:43:34.225 --> 00:43:38.063
I wish I never came.
This whole thing was a mistake.


462
00:43:38.163 --> 00:43:41.200
- Come on, Jenn, don't...
- And we should be going home tomorrow.


463
00:43:41.300 --> 00:43:43.268
But you fucked it up.

464
00:43:43.368 --> 00:43:47.002
You always fuck it all up.
You're such a fucking loser.


465
00:43:50.909 --> 00:43:53.612
The stupid lake!
Why did we have to come here?


466
00:43:53.712 --> 00:43:56.063
I don't even care why.

467
00:44:00.985 --> 00:44:02.354
Why?

468
00:44:03.621 --> 00:44:06.255
I was gonna propose to you.

469
00:44:09.360 --> 00:44:11.427
God!

470
00:45:09.387 --> 00:45:11.920
I'm really sorry.

471
00:45:16.460 --> 00:45:18.994
I had no idea.

472
00:45:28.873 --> 00:45:30.875
It's okay.

473
00:45:31.877 --> 00:45:34.676
We should probably make camp.

474
00:45:35.176 --> 00:45:37.243
We're going tomorrow.

475
00:45:37.343 --> 00:45:39.251
- Okay.
- Okay.


476
00:45:39.351 --> 00:45:41.583
Sounds good.

477
00:48:30.521 --> 00:48:33.224
- Was that a...
- No, no, no, no. It was a raccoon.


478
00:48:33.324 --> 00:48:37.292
- You can tell me the truth.
- No, I saw the little shit last night.


479
00:48:43.568 --> 00:48:45.667
Shit.

480
00:48:54.411 --> 00:48:55.684
- Is this right?
- Yeah.


481
00:48:55.784 --> 00:48:58.722
We just need to take a
turn at that overgrown trail.


482
00:48:58.822 --> 00:49:03.085
- Didn't seem this far down.
- No, we're good. We're good.


483
00:49:03.654 --> 00:49:07.089
Watch your step. 
Watch your step there.

484
00:49:27.912 --> 00:49:31.632
- Sh... shit.
- Should we go back?


485
00:49:34.018 --> 00:49:36.089
I don't know.

486
00:49:36.189 --> 00:49:39.126
What are the chances this
leading to something?


487
00:49:41.126 --> 00:49:45.194
Pretty good. Right, it's provincial park.
It's gotta lead somewhere.


488
00:50:26.303 --> 00:50:28.370
Here.

489
00:50:29.974 --> 00:50:32.044
Thank you.

490
00:50:37.715 --> 00:50:39.121
What is that?

491
00:50:46.690 --> 00:50:48.764
Bear bed.

492
00:50:52.162 --> 00:50:54.129
Okay.

493
00:50:55.233 --> 00:50:57.135
Okay.

494
00:50:57.235 --> 00:50:59.838
Let's go as far
as we can before dark.

495
00:51:00.138 --> 00:51:02.207
Right?

496
00:51:02.707 --> 00:51:04.743
Come on.

497
00:51:05.243 --> 00:51:07.409
Let's go, Alex.

498
00:51:30.968 --> 00:51:32.667
I'm so sorry.

499
00:51:38.208 --> 00:51:41.141
Did you mean those things you said?

500
00:51:42.079 --> 00:51:44.346
No, I didn't.

501
00:51:46.384 --> 00:51:48.069
'Cause, Jenn, I mean,
if that's what you feel abo...


502
00:51:48.169 --> 00:51:50.186
No.

503
00:51:53.691 --> 00:51:56.661
I should have never said that.

504
00:51:56.761 --> 00:51:59.239
I was just really mad.

505
00:52:00.364 --> 00:52:02.626
I'm sorry.

506
00:52:05.369 --> 00:52:07.078
I love you.

507
00:52:10.975 --> 00:52:13.508
Do you wanna see it?

508
00:52:14.111 --> 00:52:15.980
The ring?

509
00:52:16.080 --> 00:52:17.957
Yeah.

510
00:52:19.416 --> 00:52:21.201
If you want to.

511
00:52:35.533 --> 00:52:39.319
No, no, no, no, don't.
No. Actually, just...


512
00:52:40.638 --> 00:52:42.649
wait.

513
00:52:46.777 --> 00:52:48.710
Okay.

514
00:52:56.320 --> 00:52:59.047
So hungry.

515
00:53:00.124 --> 00:53:05.427
I think I... I think I have
half a protein bar left in here.


516
00:53:06.697 --> 00:53:10.602
And this is all
we have? This is it?

517
00:53:10.702 --> 00:53:12.768
Yeah.

518
00:53:13.070 --> 00:53:14.773
Oh, wait a second.

519
00:53:14.873 --> 00:53:17.174
Except for...

520
00:53:23.747 --> 00:53:25.648
Ta-da.

521
00:53:25.748 --> 00:53:27.951
Come on.

522
00:53:28.051 --> 00:53:30.722
- Really?
- Yeah.


523
00:53:30.822 --> 00:53:33.360
- You want some?
- Yeah.


524
00:53:36.493 --> 00:53:38.627
Straight top.

525
00:53:42.165 --> 00:53:43.935
You first.

526
00:53:44.035 --> 00:53:46.060
Okay.

527
00:53:47.639 --> 00:53:49.771
To us.

528
00:53:50.273 --> 00:53:52.441
To us.

529
00:53:56.545 --> 00:54:01.349
That is so good. Have some. It's great.

530
00:54:05.022 --> 00:54:07.355
That is good.

531
00:54:12.897 --> 00:54:15.264
I know this sucks.

532
00:54:16.000 --> 00:54:18.136
Could be worse.

533
00:54:18.236 --> 00:54:20.505
How is that?

534
00:54:20.805 --> 00:54:23.571
At least we're together.

535
00:54:28.746 --> 00:54:31.045
I mean it.

536
00:54:37.721 --> 00:54:39.888
Come here.

537
00:55:18.028 --> 00:55:20.197
What is that, Alex?

538
00:55:20.297 --> 00:55:22.461
I don't know.

539
00:55:30.774 --> 00:55:33.609
Alex, do you think it's a bear?

540
00:55:35.379 --> 00:55:37.676
Hey!

541
00:55:51.695 --> 00:55:54.499
- Is it gone?
- Let's get back in the tent.


542
00:55:54.599 --> 00:55:56.132
Okay.

543
00:55:57.101 --> 00:55:59.754
Okay. Let's go.

544
00:56:20.958 --> 00:56:23.294
It's okay.

545
00:56:23.394 --> 00:56:26.454
We scared it off. We're good.

546
00:56:26.598 --> 00:56:29.464
Okay? We're good.

547
00:57:04.168 --> 00:57:07.307
- Hi.
- Hi.


548
00:57:07.504 --> 00:57:09.741
So, I was thinking...

549
00:57:09.841 --> 00:57:14.379
that I should phone down in the front desk
and order us some room service.


550
00:57:14.479 --> 00:57:16.445
Maybe a couples massage?

551
00:57:21.985 --> 00:57:24.319
Deep tissues.

552
00:57:28.725 --> 00:57:31.394
We're gonna be okay.

553
00:57:32.596 --> 00:57:34.765
I know.

554
00:57:41.605 --> 00:57:44.672
We should get going, okay?

555
00:57:59.824 --> 00:58:03.175
What? Alex.

556
00:58:03.895 --> 00:58:07.332
- What?
- Stay quiet.


557
00:58:07.432 --> 00:58:11.503
- You're scaring me. What?
- Stay quiet. Stay quiet.


558
00:58:12.003 --> 00:58:14.602
Did he come back?

559
00:58:19.376 --> 00:58:22.290
What the fuck is he doing?

560
00:58:23.047 --> 00:58:25.634
What the fuck is he doing?

561
00:58:31.655 --> 00:58:35.287
- Did it come back? Is it outside?
- Yeah.


562
00:58:41.665 --> 00:58:44.028
Please move on. Please move on.
Please move on.


563
00:58:44.128 --> 00:58:46.938
Please move on. Please move on.
Please move on.


564
00:58:47.038 --> 00:58:49.007
Please move on. Please move on.
Please move on.


565
00:58:49.107 --> 00:58:51.391
Please move on.

566
00:59:02.286 --> 00:59:03.655
- Oh, fuck!
- What?


567
00:59:03.755 --> 00:59:07.292
- Fuck! Fuck!
- Is it out there? Did it come back?


568
00:59:07.392 --> 00:59:08.727
What do we do?
We don't even have food in here.


569
00:59:08.827 --> 00:59:11.058
I know. Where's my axe?

570
00:59:15.455 --> 00:59:18.136
- What the fuck! Where's my axe?
- You put in your bag?


571
00:59:18.736 --> 00:59:21.703
I left my bag by the fire.

572
00:59:22.940 --> 00:59:26.644
I cannot believe this is happening.
What do we do?


573
00:59:26.744 --> 00:59:30.082
What do we do?
We don't even have food in here.


574
00:59:31.682 --> 00:59:33.648
Alex.

575
00:59:57.807 --> 00:59:59.873
Alex!

576
01:00:36.446 --> 01:00:38.718
Get behind me! 
Get behind me!

577
01:00:40.700 --> 01:00:42.921
Get the fuck out!

578
01:00:45.061 --> 01:00:48.856
Get the fuck out! Just get out!

579
01:00:56.366 --> 01:00:58.433
Spray it!

580
01:01:10.780 --> 01:01:13.916
I'm gonna wrap it. 
I know, just...

581
01:01:16.253 --> 01:01:20.058
Okay. Okay, okay.

582
01:01:20.158 --> 01:01:21.911
It's okay. It's okay.

583
01:01:22.760 --> 01:01:25.093
I'm gonna wrap it.

584
01:01:30.100 --> 01:01:33.506
- It's okay.
- Jenn. Jenn, I can't feel my foot.


585
01:01:37.541 --> 01:01:39.911
It's okay. It's okay.

586
01:01:40.041 --> 01:01:41.808
- I can't feel my foot.
- I'm gonna get you out of here.


587
01:01:41.908 --> 01:01:44.315
We're gonna crawl out of here
if we have to. You hear me?


588
01:01:44.415 --> 01:01:47.222
- My God! I'm gonna fucking die out here!
- No, you're not!


589
01:01:47.322 --> 01:01:50.788
- I'm gonna fucking die!
- Alex! You're fine!


590
01:01:50.888 --> 01:01:54.112
Alex, you're gonna be fine.

591
01:02:08.071 --> 01:02:11.272
- No!
- Alex!


592
01:02:34.030 --> 01:02:37.500
Run, Jenn! Run!

593
01:05:25.185 --> 01:05:26.809
Help!

594
01:05:28.438 --> 01:05:31.060
Help!

595
01:05:32.041 --> 01:05:35.517
Help! Anybody!

596
01:10:06.616 --> 01:10:10.308
Help! Help!

597
01:14:22.638 --> 01:14:24.705
Fuck!

598
01:15:11.487 --> 01:15:13.520
Fuck!
