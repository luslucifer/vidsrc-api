Yeah, I know.

Well, according to
Fish and Game,


46
00:02:01.858 --> 00:02:03.902
there was like four quarts of
brake fluid


47
00:02:03.904 --> 00:02:05.022
spilled on the ground
where those SUVs


48
00:02:05.024 --> 00:02:06.143
were parked last night.

49
00:02:06.145 --> 00:02:08.125
Yeah, probably hit a root,
or a stump, or something.


50
00:02:08.127 --> 00:02:10.941
Either way, if they hit
a downhill slope of any kind,


51

they won't make it.

What about the kids?

There's no way around that.

They can only be on the set
eight hours a day.

doesn't involve us

they can scream all they want.

Besides, it eats up
production time.

00:15:27.648 --> 00:15:30.494
Uh, Doggie 911, sweetie?

322
00:15:30.496 --> 00:15:33.951
The show is called,
"Doggie 911."


323
00:15:36.959 --> 00:15:39.679
Oh yeah. Murphy!

324
00:15:40.159 --> 00:15:41.788
We better get out of here
before they think we did it.


325
00:15:41.790 --> 00:15:43.675
But we did do it.

326
00:15:43.677 --> 00:15:45.564
Right, reason enough
to be gone.


327
00:15:45.566 --> 00:15:47.738
Second that.
Anyone get a good picture?


328
00:15:47.740 --> 00:15:49.627
I got a couple but they're
all blurry.


329
00:15:49.629 --> 00:15:51.195
That doggie moves fast.

330
00:15:51.197 --> 00:15:53.625
Mine's great.
Peter's going to love it.


331
00:15:53.627 --> 00:15:55.290
I wonder what happened
to Murphy?


332
00:15:55.292 --> 00:15:56.441
<i>[Murphy] Don't worry
about it Isaac,</i>


333
00:15:56.443 --> 00:15:59.001
<i>I got away safe and sound.</i>

334
00:15:59.003 --> 00:16:01.080
Huh? Who said that?

335
00:16:01.082 --> 00:16:02.168
Said what?

336
00:16:02.170 --> 00:16:05.466
Nothing. Come on.

337
00:16:05.850 --> 00:16:09.018
<i>[laughter] I'm back baby!</i>

338
00:16:10.520 --> 00:16:13.397
Last time I looked at
your contracts boys,


339
00:16:13.399 --> 00:16:16.181
you were supposed to be sole
security for Murphy,


340
00:16:16.183 --> 00:16:17.684
not card sharks
sitting around set


341
00:16:17.686 --> 00:16:19.509
playing canasta all day.

342
00:16:19.511 --> 00:16:20.981
- But...
- But nothing!


343
00:16:20.983 --> 00:16:23.796
You had one job,
and one job only,


344
00:16:23.798 --> 00:16:25.843
keep that dog safe and secure.

345
00:16:25.845 --> 00:16:27.123
You've done neither.

346
00:16:27.125 --> 00:16:28.274
But it wasn't our fault,

347
00:16:28.276 --> 00:16:29.810
somebody must have opened
the car door and let him loose.


348
00:16:29.812 --> 00:16:30.834
Who?

349
00:16:30.836 --> 00:16:33.138
You were both seated less
than five yards away.


350
00:16:33.140 --> 00:16:35.378
Who let him out? Tell me?

351
00:16:35.380 --> 00:16:36.401
Leo sure didn't.

352
00:16:36.403 --> 00:16:37.425
Pottman.

353
00:16:37.427 --> 00:16:38.866
I could have been Pottman,
the dogs trainer, right?


354
00:16:38.868 --> 00:16:39.793
Pottman could have done it.

355
00:16:39.795 --> 00:16:40.912
I doubt that.

356
00:16:40.914 --> 00:16:42.736
He's to invested in the dog
to do something so stupid.


357
00:16:42.738 --> 00:16:46.510
No, gentleman, as it stands
Murphy disappeared on your watch


358
00:16:46.512 --> 00:16:48.782
and the agency, meaning me,
is holding you both


359
00:16:48.784 --> 00:16:50.383
personally responsible.

360
00:16:50.385 --> 00:16:51.917
Should we call local shelters?

361
00:16:51.919 --> 00:16:53.677
If it were me I'd call
my lawyers and accountants,


362
00:16:53.679 --> 00:16:56.012
because if you don't
find that animal quickly


363
00:16:56.014 --> 00:16:57.580
QN Productions is gonna sue you

364
00:16:57.582 --> 00:16:59.565
for every penny you've got.

365
00:16:59.567 --> 00:17:00.396
Understand?

366
00:17:00.398 --> 00:17:01.707
We do Miss Smith.

367
00:17:01.709 --> 00:17:04.747
Good. Now get going. Find him.

368
00:17:04.749 --> 00:17:07.114
Yes, ma'am, will do.

369
00:17:07.116 --> 00:17:09.517
Go. Go.

370
00:17:11.372 --> 00:17:15.977
[sigh] So, what do we do now,
just close down?


371
00:17:15.979 --> 00:17:17.642
Of course not.

372
00:17:17.644 --> 00:17:19.465
Shoot around the dog until
we get him back.


373
00:17:19.467 --> 00:17:21.672
Mm. And if somehow that
doesn't happen?


374
00:17:21.674 --> 00:17:22.856
You remember Lassie, Jim?

375
00:17:22.858 --> 00:17:23.656
Yeah, sure.

376
00:17:23.658 --> 00:17:25.223
There were actually a dozen
Lassies,


377
00:17:25.225 --> 00:17:26.535
one for each trick.

378
00:17:26.537 --> 00:17:27.495
I'm going back to Hollywood,

379
00:17:27.497 --> 00:17:30.214
and put out a call for a
Jack Russell Terrier.


380
00:17:30.216 --> 00:17:32.359
If we can't have the original,
we'll hire a double.


381
00:17:32.361 --> 00:17:34.245
I don't know,
dog's pretty smart.


382
00:17:34.247 --> 00:17:36.356
You just leave it to me.

383
00:17:36.358 --> 00:17:39.236
My pleasure.

384
00:17:39.238 --> 00:17:41.829
Wow, that was so cool the way
your brother's app


385
00:17:41.831 --> 00:17:44.004
opened the car door.

386
00:17:44.006 --> 00:17:45.700
Yeah, he's gotten real good at
the computer


387
00:17:45.702 --> 00:17:47.874
ever since his accident.

388

<i>[Murphy] Ah, so it was these</i>

it wasn't anybody on set.</i>

Murphy's all right.


391

[Kyle] He sure took of running.

392
00:17:55.268 --> 00:17:57.345
He must not like the movie
business very much.


393

<i>[Murphy] No,
I didn't realize it showed.</i>

This is taking forever.

397
00:18:06.082 --> 00:18:08.702
Walking home seems twice as far.

398
00:18:08.704 --> 00:18:11.007
My dad says
that's called expectations.


399
00:18:11.009 --> 00:18:13.662
He gets the same way whenever
he goes to the race track.


400
00:18:13.664 --> 00:18:16.638
He claims coming home is
always long and tougher.


401
00:18:16.640 --> 00:18:19.999
Well, we could always
take the short-cut.

That's a death trap.

00:18:33.341 --> 00:18:35.417
It would get us home
in record time.


408
00:18:35.419 --> 00:18:37.913
That is if we actually
made it to the bottom.

never even go near it.

00:18:58.454 --> 00:19:00.723
the most structurally-stable
building.


418
00:19:00.725 --> 00:19:04.213

Half of me wants to try it out,

but the other half says,
definitely not.


425

[Kyle] Listen to
the other half, Ronnie.


426
00:19:26.322 --> 00:19:29.614
They closed this thing down for
a good reason.

[Isaac] Hey guys,
check this out.


428

What is it?

429
00:19:32.207 --> 00:19:33.935
Looks like a bunch of old
helmets and stuff.


430
00:19:33.937 --> 00:19:35.117
You think it's worth anything?

431
00:19:35.119 --> 00:19:38.060
I don't know, might be able to
get something for it online.


432
00:19:38.062 --> 00:19:39.149
Hardly worth the trouble.

433
00:19:39.151 --> 00:19:41.837
But at least we could actually
make the jump safely.


434
00:19:41.839 --> 00:19:44.652
Come on, let's just walk it,
we'll get home soon enough.

<i>Good idea Syd. 
Why risk it?</i>

You said it, Kyle. Why risk it?

Why risk what?

438
00:19:49.293 --> 00:19:51.242
You just said, "Why risk it?"

00:19:51.244 --> 00:19:53.194
No I didn't.

Well, I kinda figured finding
him here would be way too easy.


444
00:20:10.792 --> 00:20:12.583
Yeah, but it makes me sad
to see all those


445

other poor little dog
caged up like that.

Yeah, me too, Joe.

447
00:20:15.399 --> 00:20:17.414
But right now I'm interested in
finding one dog,


448
00:20:17.416 --> 00:20:19.364
the dog that's going to save
our jobs.


449
00:20:19.366 --> 00:20:20.996
You really think the studio's
going to come after us


450
00:20:20.998 --> 00:20:22.885
for all that money
if we don't find him?


451
00:20:22.887 --> 00:20:24.195
You bet they will.

452
00:20:24.197 --> 00:20:26.179
We'll be paying that debt off
for 20 years or more.

00:20:26.181 --> 00:20:27.844
What about Leo the driver?

454
00:20:27.846 --> 00:20:29.122
Maybe it was him
that let the mutt escape.


455
00:20:29.124 --> 00:20:31.426
- No, I don't think so.
- How so?


456
00:20:31.428 --> 00:20:32.324
Well, when you were packing up

457
00:20:32.326 --> 00:20:34.689
I gave Leo's limo a thorough
going over.


458
00:20:34.691 --> 00:20:35.618
Find anything?

459
00:20:35.620 --> 00:20:38.240
Uh-huh, the rear door
on the driver's side


460
00:20:38.242 --> 00:20:42.306
was unlocked, and the window
was completely rolled down.


461
00:20:42.308 --> 00:20:45.343
Mm. So?

462
00:20:45.345 --> 00:20:47.104
So, Leo loves
his air conditioning much,


463
00:20:47.106 --> 00:20:48.223
he'd never let that happen.

464
00:20:48.225 --> 00:20:50.271
Then who?

465
00:20:50.273 --> 00:20:51.934
I think someone hacked
the limo's computer


466
00:20:51.936 --> 00:20:53.629
from the outside,

467
00:20:53.631 --> 00:20:55.710
and helped that
little fellow escape.


468
00:20:55.712 --> 00:20:56.702
Seriously?

469
00:20:56.704 --> 00:20:57.758
Hm-hm.

470
00:20:57.760 --> 00:21:00.477
And I have a pretty good idea,
who too.


471
00:21:00.479 --> 00:21:02.587
PETA?

472
00:21:02.589 --> 00:21:03.260
No.

473
00:21:03.262 --> 00:21:05.692
- A rival network maybe?
- No.


474
00:21:05.694 --> 00:21:06.813
So who?

475
00:21:06.815 --> 00:21:08.859
Do you remember those kids
standing off to the side?


476
00:21:08.861 --> 00:21:11.131
No way, the oldest one
couldn't have been more than 10.


477
00:21:11.133 --> 00:21:13.019
My seven-year-old niece knows
more about hacking


478
00:21:13.021 --> 00:21:14.587

Tell me later,

But the man on the news
said he got away

and no one can find him.

632
00:26:54.681 --> 00:26:55.895
I'm worried, Mama.

633
00:26:55.897 --> 00:26:56.949
Well, don't you be afraid,

634
00:26:56.951 --> 00:26:59.798
I've got people out
looking for Murphy as we speak.


635
00:26:59.800 --> 00:27:04.213
We'll get him back
safe and sound, and soon too.


636
00:27:04.215 --> 00:27:05.556
Is Calomay getting you
ready for school?


637
00:27:05.558 --> 00:27:07.923
Yes, she's with me right here.

638
00:27:07.925 --> 00:27:10.068
[Candace] <i>Let me
speak to her, okay?</i>


639
00:27:10.070 --> 00:27:11.379
She wants to talk to you.

640
00:27:11.381 --> 00:27:12.661
Okay.

641
00:27:14.165 --> 00:27:15.633
Hi Mrs. Smith.

642
00:27:15.635 --> 00:27:17.617
Is it really on the news,
I mean about the dog?


643
00:27:17.619 --> 00:27:19.025
Yes, on every channel.

644
00:27:19.027 --> 00:27:20.561
Darn, I was hoping we could
keep this out of the press


645
00:27:20.563 --> 00:27:22.769
until we got him back.

646
00:27:22.771 --> 00:27:25.488
Well, the news is out there
now I'm afraid.


647
00:27:25.490 --> 00:27:27.984
I know how much she
loves that dog.


648
00:27:27.986 --> 00:27:29.168
So do my little ones.

649
00:27:29.170 --> 00:27:31.055
I mean the whole world
loves him.


650
00:27:31.057 --> 00:27:33.935
So, play things down on the
way to school, understand?


651
00:27:33.937 --> 00:27:35.086
Try to keep her mind off it.

652
00:27:35.088 --> 00:27:36.078
Okay.

653
00:27:36.080 --> 00:27:37.326
Well, I've got to run into
an early meeting.


654
00:27:37.328 --> 00:27:38.894
Tell her not to worry, okay?

655
00:27:38.896 --> 00:27:40.014
I'll be home around 9:00.

656
00:27:40.016 --> 00:27:42.605
Okay, I'll see you then.

657
00:27:42.607 --> 00:27:43.821
She didn't want to
say, goodbye?


658
00:27:43.823 --> 00:27:46.189
Oh no Honey,
she's just really busy,


659
00:27:46.191 --> 00:27:48.812
but she did say not to worry.

660
00:27:48.814 --> 00:27:52.106
I'm sorry, I can't help it.

661
00:27:52.108 --> 00:27:52.748
I'm with you.

662
00:27:52.750 --> 00:27:56.298
Let's get you off to school.

663
00:27:56.300 --> 00:27:59.082
According to insiders,
TV's most famous canine,


664
00:27:59.084 --> 00:28:00.744
Murphy the Wonder Dog,

665
00:28:00.746 --> 00:28:03.241
escaped from a movie set
in canyon country yesterday,


666
00:28:03.243 --> 00:28:04.744
and up until now has eluded,

667
00:28:04.746 --> 00:28:06.697
both his trainer,
security guards,


668
00:28:06.699 --> 00:28:08.744
and the public at large.

669
00:28:08.746 --> 00:28:11.271
A reward of $25,000,

670
00:28:11.273 --> 00:28:12.648
yes you heard right,

671
00:28:12.650 --> 00:28:15.046
has been offered for his
safe return.


672
00:28:15.048 --> 00:28:17.222
[TV Reporter] We now return to
our regularly scheduled program.


673
00:28:17.224 --> 00:28:18.949
Where is he?

674
00:28:18.951 --> 00:28:20.422
I don't know.
When I woke up he was gone.


675
00:28:20.424 --> 00:28:21.990
Do you think he
went outside to...


676
00:28:21.992 --> 00:28:22.885
You know?

677
00:28:22.887 --> 00:28:25.061
No, he's most likely afraid.

678
00:28:25.063 --> 00:28:25.860
Of what?

679
00:28:25.862 --> 00:28:27.652
Oh, because there's
a big reward out


680
00:28:27.654 --> 00:28:29.828
if anyone finds him and brings
him back to the studio.


681
00:28:29.830 --> 00:28:31.715
And if what he told us
is even half true,


682
00:28:31.717 --> 00:28:33.763
I would never want to go
back to that place.


683
00:28:33.765 --> 00:28:34.660
Whoah.

684
00:28:34.662 --> 00:28:38.176
Yeah, it's all over the TV,
and the net.


685
00:28:38.178 --> 00:28:39.362
I just hope he's all right.

686
00:28:39.364 --> 00:28:40.289
Me too.

687
00:28:40.291 --> 00:28:41.187
Come on big brother,

688

Mr. Kirkland will be here
any minute now,


689
00:28:43.202 --> 00:28:45.440
and you know how he hates
to be kept waiting.


690
00:28:45.442 --> 00:28:47.167
I'm so sick of home school.

691
00:28:47.169 --> 00:28:48.319
I wish I could go back to
normal class


692
00:28:48.321 --> 00:28:49.568
with you and the gang.

693

Well, why don't you?

694
00:28:50.977 --> 00:28:52.063
Because I can't.

695
00:28:52.065 --> 00:28:53.886
The doctor keeps telling mom
that you have the power


696
00:28:53.888 --> 00:28:56.735
to get up and walk,
so just do it.


697
00:28:56.737 --> 00:28:58.781
Believe me sis,
I try every day,


698
00:28:58.783 --> 00:29:01.438
but my legs still feel numb
like right after the accident.


699
00:29:01.440 --> 00:29:02.749
Well, let me help you.

700
00:29:02.751 --> 00:29:04.892
No. I got it. I got it.

701
00:29:04.894 --> 00:29:06.333
You really got this thing down.

702
00:29:06.335 --> 00:29:08.188
Yeah, you should see my
motorized one.


703
00:29:08.190 --> 00:29:11.067
I can go zero to 60
in under 15 seconds.


704
00:29:11.069 --> 00:29:13.050
Let's keep it under
the speed limit for now, okay?


705
00:29:13.052 --> 00:29:14.908
Okay, sis.

<i>[Engine sounds]</i>

707
00:29:21.340 --> 00:29:23.321
So, how'd she sound?

708
00:29:23.323 --> 00:29:25.561
Well, better than yesterday,
but still plenty angry.


709
00:29:25.563 --> 00:29:27.192
But we're still on the payroll,
right?


710
00:29:27.194 --> 00:29:28.632
Yeah, well, for today buddy,
but who knows what's


711
00:29:28.634 --> 00:29:30.583
going to happen tomorrow
if Murphy doesn't turn up.


712
00:29:30.585 --> 00:29:32.728
Do you think we could somehow
locate the dog today?


713
00:29:32.730 --> 00:29:34.295
We've got to find those kids,
see what they know.


714
00:29:34.297 --> 00:29:35.863
That's not going to be easy.

715
00:29:35.865 --> 00:29:37.014
There are probably
three or four schools


716
00:29:37.016 --> 00:29:38.261
in the area with kids that age,

717
00:29:38.263 --> 00:29:39.765
and who knows if they'll
come forward.


718
00:29:39.767 --> 00:29:40.917
We have to start somewhere.

719
00:29:40.919 --> 00:29:42.389
So how are we going to
recognize them?


720
00:29:42.391 --> 00:29:44.884
They were too far away
from set to ID.


721
00:29:44.886 --> 00:29:46.420
I have an idea.

722
00:29:46.422 --> 00:29:48.116
One of those kids
was doing yo-yo tricks.


723
00:29:48.118 --> 00:29:50.004
There are millions of kids
with yo-yos.


724
00:29:50.006 --> 00:29:52.339
Not anymore, you're living
in the past buddy.


725
00:29:52.341 --> 00:29:54.482
Today's all cellphones
and tablets.


726
00:29:54.484 --> 00:29:57.042
No, no, yo-yos went out with
hula hoops and 8-tracks.


727
00:29:57.044 --> 00:30:00.307
Eight tracks?
What are eight tracks?


728
00:30:00.309 --> 00:30:03.472
You know the, eight...

729
00:30:03.474 --> 00:30:05.679
This seems like
a job for Sherlock Holmes.


730
00:30:05.681 --> 00:30:06.639
Personally I think we need

731
00:30:06.641 --> 00:30:07.920
James Bond.

quite a spot for you.

Overall it's what we
talked about and agreed to, yes,


756
00:31:22.691 --> 00:31:23.552
but I'm a little worried

757
00:31:23.554 --> 00:31:25.985
about it being so close to
James Bond.


758

I don't want the people
in England

Maybe so,
but, but I'm concerned.

Sir, you need to
take a look at this.

I just got this text
from my wife.

What is it?

767
00:31:40.832 --> 00:31:41.981
Just read it, sir.

768
00:31:41.983 --> 00:31:45.916
Can it wait?
No sir, it can't.


769
00:31:45.918 --> 00:31:48.443
It says that Murphy the dog
was missing since this morning,


770
00:31:48.445 --> 00:31:49.724
the whole world
is looking for him,

and there's a big reward
on his head.

Is this true Candy?

773
00:31:53.309 --> 00:31:56.059
Well, he did get away
from us yesterday on set,


774
00:31:56.061 --> 00:31:57.690
but I have people out now
combing the area,


775
00:31:57.692 --> 00:31:59.642
looking to track him down
quickly.


776

This is no good.

00:32:01.818 --> 00:32:02.905
I know, sir.

779
00:32:02.907 --> 00:32:04.441
If that dog is missing
permanently


780
00:32:04.443 --> 00:32:05.560
the show goes down

and Alamo might as well
go with it.

With all our fan mail
we could lose our core audience.

I can see the reaction already,

00:32:10.745 --> 00:32:12.343
if they can't keep track
of their mascot,


785

how can they make
a decent dog food?

00:32:22.616 --> 00:32:23.989
this week and next week.

790
00:32:23.991 --> 00:32:24.789
We don't want the public

791
00:32:24.791 --> 00:32:26.580
thinking that Alamo
is insensitive


792
00:32:26.582 --> 00:32:28.020
to the loss of a dog.

793
00:32:28.022 --> 00:32:30.325
Yes sir, I'll keep you
informed of our progress.


794
00:32:30.327 --> 00:32:31.730
You do that.

795
00:32:31.732 --> 00:32:35.540
Gentlemen, let's head back.

796
00:32:38.676 --> 00:32:41.459
And the name is Candace.

797
00:32:47.923 --> 00:32:49.903
Okay you two,
let's get this show on the road,


798
00:32:49.905 --> 00:32:51.087
you're going to be late
for school again.


799
00:32:51.089 --> 00:32:53.711
I won't, I'm already in
class with Mr. Kirkland.


800
00:32:53.713 --> 00:32:54.671
That's right, bud.

801
00:32:54.673 --> 00:32:56.687
Why don't we get to the table,
and get started.


802
00:32:56.689 --> 00:32:57.710
Math first?

803
00:32:57.712 --> 00:32:58.542
You got it.

804
00:32:58.544 --> 00:33:00.238
Okay, sir.

805
00:33:00.240 --> 00:33:03.023
Oh my gosh, I almost forgot...

806
00:33:08.141 --> 00:33:09.356
Later, sis!

807
00:33:09.358 --> 00:33:10.410
Later, bro!

808
00:33:10.412 --> 00:33:12.971
Let me know if you run into
anyone special, okay?


809
00:33:12.973 --> 00:33:14.667
Oh, I will.

810
00:33:14.669 --> 00:33:16.427
What was that all about?

811
00:33:16.429 --> 00:33:17.355
You guys planning something?

812
00:33:17.357 --> 00:33:19.657
Yeah, it's a little
brother sister secret.


813
00:33:19.659 --> 00:33:21.258
Ah, I got you.

814
00:33:21.260 --> 00:33:22.187
I used to do the same thing

815
00:33:22.189 --> 00:33:23.497
with my little sister
when I was your age.


816
00:33:23.499 --> 00:33:24.745
You did?

817
00:33:24.747 --> 00:33:25.578
Yeah, I did.

818
00:33:25.580 --> 00:33:26.537
You know, contrary to
popular belief,


819
00:33:26.539 --> 00:33:29.256
I too was once a young person,
like yourself.


820
00:33:29.258 --> 00:33:30.983
Really?

821
00:33:30.985 --> 00:33:34.088
Yeah, really.

822
00:33:39.559 --> 00:33:41.030
Syd, here are the cookies
I made last night


823
00:33:41.032 --> 00:33:42.661
for the bake sale at school,

824
00:33:42.663 --> 00:33:44.420
and don't you and your friends
go eating all of them


825
00:33:44.422 --> 00:33:46.244
before you even
get to class, okay?


826
00:33:46.246 --> 00:33:48.357
Yes, mom.

827
00:33:48.359 --> 00:33:49.667
And here's $5
so you can buy something


828
00:33:49.669 --> 00:33:51.331
for tonight's desert.

829
00:33:51.333 --> 00:33:52.163
Yes, mom.

830
00:33:52.165 --> 00:33:53.539
Any kind of cake or pie
is all right,


831
00:33:53.541 --> 00:33:55.715
as long as it's not
mince or rhubarb.


832
00:33:55.717 --> 00:33:56.419
Yes, mom.

833
00:33:56.421 --> 00:33:57.284
Okay, off with you now.

834
00:33:57.286 --> 00:34:00.004
- Bye, mom.
- I'll see you after school.


835
00:34:01.156 --> 00:34:03.456
Michael, Peter, can I get
either of you


836
00:34:03.458 --> 00:34:04.736
a little toast or coffee?

837
00:34:04.738 --> 00:34:06.720
- We're good.
- No, I'm fine, thanks.


838
00:34:06.722 --> 00:34:08.223
Good, maybe I can relax a bit

839
00:34:08.225 --> 00:34:09.792
and catch up on the
morning news.


840
00:34:09.794 --> 00:34:12.063
There's only one thing
on the news this morning.


841
00:34:12.065 --> 00:34:13.566
Really? What?

842
00:34:13.568 --> 00:34:15.071
That missing dog
from Hollywood.


843
00:34:15.073 --> 00:34:17.184
He got lost around these parts
yesterday afternoon.


844
00:34:17.186 --> 00:34:18.973
You know, I heard on the radio
this morning,


845
00:34:18.975 --> 00:34:22.174
they upped the reward
to $50,000.


846
00:34:22.176 --> 00:34:27.103
You don't say,
we could really use that cash.


847
00:34:35.101 --> 00:34:36.476
I don't believe it.

848
00:34:36.478 --> 00:34:37.275
Neither do I.

849
00:34:37.277 --> 00:34:39.225
Come on Syd,
quick faking us out.


850
00:34:39.227 --> 00:34:40.601
It's true I tell you.

851
00:34:40.603 --> 00:34:42.841
He jumped through Peter's
bedroom window last night


852
00:34:42.843 --> 00:34:44.857
and just started talking.

853
00:34:44.859 --> 00:34:45.754
Do you mean like

854
00:34:45.756 --> 00:34:47.929
opening his mouth
and actually speaking?


855
00:34:47.931 --> 00:34:50.200
No, more like
we heard his voice in our heads.


856
00:34:50.202 --> 00:34:51.639
Oh, like telepathy.

857
00:34:51.641 --> 00:34:52.791
Yeah, like that.

858
00:34:52.793 --> 00:34:54.775
I saw aliens on TV
do that once,


859
00:34:54.777 --> 00:34:56.567
but they were from
another planet.


860
00:34:56.569 --> 00:34:59.478
Do you think Murphy's some
sort of dog from outer space?


861
00:34:59.480 --> 00:35:02.357
<i>[Murphy] Heck, I'm no alien,
I'm from right here on earth,</i>


862
00:35:02.359 --> 00:35:04.117
<i>born and bred [laughs].</i>

863
00:35:04.119 --> 00:35:05.269
Did you guys hear that?

864
00:35:05.271 --> 00:35:06.292
I think I did.

865
00:35:06.294 --> 00:35:07.893
I don't know.

866
00:35:07.895 --> 00:35:09.331
Hey, Murph, is that you?

867
00:35:09.333 --> 00:35:11.892
<i>You bet it is, actor, writer...</i>

868
00:35:11.894 --> 00:35:13.778
<i>But what I really want to do
is direct.</i>


869
00:35:13.780 --> 00:35:15.889
Wow, it's really him!

870
00:35:15.891 --> 00:35:17.361
I must be dreaming.

871
00:35:17.363 --> 00:35:18.002
Hey, Murph.

872
00:35:18.004 --> 00:35:19.729
<i>Hey Syd. Hey everybody.</i>

873
00:35:19.731 --> 00:35:21.714
My gosh, Syd, you were
telling the truth.


874
00:35:21.716 --> 00:35:22.577
What'd you think?

875
00:35:22.579 --> 00:35:24.754
But he can actually talk?

876
00:35:24.756 --> 00:35:26.257
I don't believe it.

877
00:35:26.259 --> 00:35:27.344
<i>Believe it Isaac.</i>

878
00:35:27.346 --> 00:35:29.424
<i>Believe it,
I've been talking for years.</i>


879
00:35:29.426 --> 00:35:31.728
So how come you don't
talk when you're on TV shows?


880
00:35:31.730 --> 00:35:33.807
<i>Well, for one thing
the scripts stink,</i>


881
00:35:33.809 --> 00:35:35.630
<i>they're not very good,
and for another,</i>


882
00:35:35.632 --> 00:35:36.815
<i>a talking dog might draw</i>

883
00:35:36.817 --> 00:35:38.959
<i>some unnecessary attention
from the government.</i>


884
00:35:38.961 --> 00:35:40.974
<i>They'd immediately want to know
what makes me so special.</i>


885
00:35:40.976 --> 00:35:42.701
So what does make you special?

886
00:35:42.703 --> 00:35:44.557
Yeah, how's it that you
can talk?


887
00:35:44.559 --> 00:35:45.645
<i>Well, how about you give me</i>

888
00:35:45.647 --> 00:35:47.308
<i>a couple of those cookies
you got there</i>


889
00:35:47.310 --> 00:35:48.588
<i>and we'll chat
on the way to school.</i>


890
00:35:48.590 --> 00:35:52.523
Yeah, we'll be late
if we don't hustle.


891
00:35:52.525 --> 00:35:54.315
Here you go, Murph.

892
00:35:54.317 --> 00:35:57.035
<i>Wow, freshly baked. Nice!</i>

893
00:35:57.037 --> 00:36:00.041
<i>I never get cookies
at the kennel.</i>


894
00:36:00.043 --> 00:36:01.482
The kennel?

895
00:36:01.484 --> 00:36:02.666
I saw on Celebrity Insider

896
00:36:02.668 --> 00:36:05.352
that you lived in a big house
in Hollywood.


897
00:36:05.354 --> 00:36:06.504
<i>Big house?</i>

898
00:36:06.506 --> 00:36:08.552
<i>My trainer lives in a big house
in Hollywood Isaac.</i>


899
00:36:08.554 --> 00:36:09.608
<i>Every night after work he</i>

900
00:36:09.610 --> 00:36:12.072
<i>locks in a private little kennel
in the backyard</i>


901
00:36:12.074 --> 00:36:13.159
<i>until the next morning.</i>

902
00:36:13.161 --> 00:36:16.839
Wow, that sounds awful,
doesn't he ever play with you?


903
00:36:16.841 --> 00:36:19.014
<i>Nah, the only time he ever
even speaks to me</i>


904
00:36:19.016 --> 00:36:21.189
<i>is when he wants to teach me
a new trick.</i>


905
00:36:21.191 --> 00:36:22.726
Gee, that stinks.

906
00:36:22.728 --> 00:36:24.901
<i>It kind of does, Ron.
Can I call you Ron?</i>


907
00:36:24.903 --> 00:36:27.365
<i>That whole la-la land bit
get's really old, really fast</i>


908
00:36:27.367 --> 00:36:28.262
<i>let me tell you.</i>

909
00:36:28.264 --> 00:36:31.300
So that's why you took of
when you did.


910
00:36:31.302 --> 00:36:32.356
<i>Exactly.</i>

911
00:36:32.358 --> 00:36:34.787
<i>You kids gave me an opportunity
and I took it!</i>


912
00:36:34.789 --> 00:36:36.964
So you knew it was
that freed you?


913
00:36:36.966 --> 00:36:39.490
<i>Kyle my boy, I'm not just
a pretty face,</i>


914
00:36:39.492 --> 00:36:41.410
<i>I got brains I haven't even
used yet.</i>


915
00:36:41.412 --> 00:36:43.425
<i>No, see, somebody hacked
the Wi-Fi in the limo</i>


916
00:36:43.427 --> 00:36:45.824
<i>to make that lock and door
bit happen.</i>


917
00:36:45.826 --> 00:36:48.768
<i>I just figured it was you four.</i>

918
00:36:48.770 --> 00:36:50.560
Guilty as charged,

919
00:36:50.562 --> 00:36:52.769
but now knowing how
they treated you,


920
00:36:52.771 --> 00:36:54.302
I'm kind of glad I did it.

921
00:36:54.304 --> 00:36:55.648
<i>You're not the only one, guy.</i>

922
00:36:55.650 --> 00:36:57.183
<i>I'm mighty grateful to you all.</i>

923
00:36:57.185 --> 00:36:59.261
<i>Now, come on,
let's get you guys to class</i>


924
00:36:59.263 --> 00:37:00.287
<i>before they make you,
I don't know,</i>


925
00:37:00.289 --> 00:37:01.278
<i>sit in a corner?</i>

926
00:37:01.280 --> 00:37:03.196
<i>Do they still do that,
by the way?</i>


927
00:37:03.198 --> 00:37:04.412
Hardly ever.

928
00:37:04.414 --> 00:37:06.172
<i>You see, I've been locked
away so long I've been...</i>


929
00:37:06.174 --> 00:37:08.156
<i>[Sneeze] I've been
behind the times.</i>


930
00:37:08.158 --> 00:37:11.036
<i>Here we go.</i>

931
00:37:11.038 --> 00:37:12.956
Then he just said,
kill all the commercials


932
00:37:12.958 --> 00:37:13.947
for at least two weeks.

933
00:37:13.949 --> 00:37:17.338
So we've got a missing dog,
and a missing dog


934
00:37:16.413 --> 00:37:17.467
means I've got a problem.

935
00:37:17.469 --> 00:37:18.875
And when I've got a problem
I start to think about


936
00:37:18.877 --> 00:37:22.649
how everyone is replaceable,
so...


937
00:37:22.651 --> 00:37:24.377
I have men out there looking
for him now,


938
00:37:24.379 --> 00:37:26.010
but so far nothing.

939
00:37:26.012 --> 00:37:26.969
And the TV show?

940
00:37:26.971 --> 00:37:28.217
The director is shooting
everything he can


941
00:37:28.219 --> 00:37:29.497
that doesn't include the animal.

942
00:37:29.499 --> 00:37:31.257
But Smith, that's a short
solution


943
00:37:31.259 --> 00:37:32.312
to a tall problem.

944
00:37:32.314 --> 00:37:35.800
What we need to look for
is the worst case scenario.


945
00:37:35.802 --> 00:37:36.823
And that is?

946
00:37:36.825 --> 00:37:39.351
That the dog is gone
and we won't get him back.


947
00:37:39.353 --> 00:37:41.590
And if we don't get him back
the show won't go on.


948
00:37:41.592 --> 00:37:43.637
And if the show doesn't go on
it will curtail


949
00:37:43.639 --> 00:37:47.539
certain life sustaining
revenue streams.


950
00:37:47.541 --> 00:37:48.725
And we could lose millions.

951
00:37:48.727 --> 00:37:51.540
And we could lose millions,
but not, N-O-T,


952
00:37:51.542 --> 00:37:54.258
not if we can find
a quick replacement.


953
00:37:54.260 --> 00:37:55.188
Sir?

954
00:37:55.190 --> 00:37:56.307
Look, Candice, the one thing
I've learned


955
00:37:56.309 --> 00:37:58.962
in my decades in the big time,

956
00:37:58.964 --> 00:38:01.169
surviving in
dog eat dog Hollywood,


957
00:38:01.171 --> 00:38:04.017
is that nothing, no one,
is irreplaceable.


958
00:38:04.019 --> 00:38:06.512
You, him, them, these, those,
nobody.


959
00:38:06.514 --> 00:38:10.447
I don't know, that dog is
loved by millions.


960
00:38:10.449 --> 00:38:12.464
There have been at least

961
00:38:12.466 --> 00:38:15.439
over the years, not to mention
Batman, Superman, and X-men.


962
00:38:15.441 --> 00:38:16.336
Put out a call,

963
00:38:16.338 --> 00:38:19.087
get some new dogs in here
this afternoon.


964
00:38:19.089 --> 00:38:20.654
This is Hollywood,
we should be able to find


965
00:38:20.656 --> 00:38:23.758
a couple hundred canines
anxious to be the next


966
00:38:23.760 --> 00:38:24.781
Murphy the Wonder Dog.

967
00:38:24.783 --> 00:38:25.580
Just get on it.

968
00:38:25.582 --> 00:38:27.053
But we can't just...

969
00:38:27.055 --> 00:38:28.653
No buts, just do it.

970
00:38:28.655 --> 00:38:30.636
I'll clear my schedule between

971
00:38:30.638 --> 00:38:32.651
I'm sure we can see
the best dogs


972
00:38:32.653 --> 00:38:36.459
Tinseltown has to offer
in under two hours.


973
00:38:36.461 --> 00:38:38.539
I guarantee you we'll find
the next Murphy


974
00:38:38.541 --> 00:38:41.354
by the end of the day.

975
00:38:41.356 --> 00:38:44.106
Yes, sir, I'll get right on it.

976
00:38:44.108 --> 00:38:45.865
I'm counting on you.

977
00:38:45.867 --> 00:38:48.937
The kids of the world
are counting on you.


978
00:38:48.939 --> 00:38:50.760
I'll bring the Alamo.

979
00:38:50.762 --> 00:38:55.207
Funny. Very funny.

980
00:38:55.209 --> 00:38:56.646
So Murphy, you still haven't
told us


981
00:38:56.648 --> 00:38:58.055
how you got the power to talk.

982
00:38:58.057 --> 00:38:59.014
<i>Oh, you don't want to</i>

983
00:38:59.016 --> 00:39:01.030
<i>hear that old story,
it's boring.</i>


984
00:39:01.032 --> 00:39:03.333
No, come on, tell us,
we all want to know.


985
00:39:03.335 --> 00:39:04.453
I do at least.

986
00:39:04.455 --> 00:39:05.446
Yeah, Murph, spill it.

987
00:39:05.448 --> 00:39:08.101
<i>Okay, okay,
you guys like cartoons?</i>


988
00:39:08.103 --> 00:39:09.091
I guess so.

989
00:39:09.093 --> 00:39:10.533
<i>Well then, I, I, I...</i>

990
00:39:10.535 --> 00:39:11.556
<i>Here's a flashback for you,</i>

991
00:39:11.558 --> 00:39:13.699
<i>short, sweet,
and right to the point.</i>


992
00:39:13.701 --> 00:39:15.394
<i>I was a loner, no family,
friends,</i>


993
00:39:15.396 --> 00:39:16.803
<i>just running around the
countryside</i>


994
00:39:16.805 --> 00:39:19.554
<i>picking up scraps wherever
I could.</i>


995
00:39:19.556 --> 00:39:21.123
<i>And one day I hopped
a train to Hollywood.</i>


996
00:39:21.125 --> 00:39:22.210
<i>I'm thinking fun
in the sun, right?</i>


997
00:39:22.212 --> 00:39:24.097
<i>Only thing, it's raining
when I get there.</i>


998
00:39:24.099 --> 00:39:24.865
<i>What's that about?</i>

999
00:39:24.867 --> 00:39:26.496
<i>So I'm thinking, maybe Vegas,</i>

1000
00:39:26.498 --> 00:39:29.375
<i>but just then lightning strikes
me on the head.</i>


1001
00:39:29.377 --> 00:39:30.560
<i>Twenty-four hours later,
I wake up</i>


1002
00:39:30.562 --> 00:39:31.903
<i>in an animal shelter
and I'm suddenly hearing</i>


1003
00:39:31.905 --> 00:39:34.879
<i>what everybody's thinking,
and understanding it as well.</i>


1004
00:39:34.881 --> 00:39:36.031
So what happened next?

1005
00:39:36.033 --> 00:39:37.887
<i>Well, some guy from Universal
comes in looking</i>


1006
00:39:37.889 --> 00:39:40.286
<i>to pick up dog extras
for "Beethoven 18."</i>


1007
00:39:40.288 --> 00:39:41.598
I never saw that one.

1008
00:39:41.600 --> 00:39:44.605
<i>Nobody did, old Beethoven's
contract was up, you see,</i>


1009
00:39:44.607 --> 00:39:46.238
<i>and like most movie dogs</i>

1010
00:39:46.240 --> 00:39:47.486
<i>he was tired
and just wanted out.</i>


1011
00:39:47.488 --> 00:39:49.564
<i>I should have listened
to that lovable St. Bernard.</i>


1012
00:39:49.566 --> 00:39:51.867
<i>But no, being a young, impulsive
pup</i>


1013
00:39:51.869 --> 00:39:53.115
<i>I made a fool out of myself</i>

1014
00:39:53.117 --> 00:39:55.644
<i>doing all these wild tricks
for the trainer on set.</i>


1015
00:39:55.646 --> 00:39:56.988
Then what?

1016
00:39:56.990 --> 00:39:58.810
<i>Well, next think you know,</i>

1017
00:39:58.812 --> 00:40:00.923
<i>I'm doing a pilot
for Doggie 911,</i>


1018
00:40:00.925 --> 00:40:03.928
<i>and the rest as they say,
is television history.</i>


1019
00:40:03.930 --> 00:40:05.594
<i>I got the number one show
on the tube,</i>


1020
00:40:05.596 --> 00:40:07.415
<i>and I hate every minute of it!</i>

1021
00:40:07.417 --> 00:40:09.240
<i>That's why I just had to
get away.</i>


1022
00:40:09.242 --> 00:40:10.680
You can stay with us
if you want.


1023
00:40:10.682 --> 00:40:12.023
There's plenty of room,

1024
00:40:12.025 --> 00:40:14.103
and you'd be perfect company
for my brother.


1025
00:40:14.105 --> 00:40:16.822
You know, he's housebound
ever since his accident.


1026
00:40:16.824 --> 00:40:19.254
<i>I really appreciate your
kindness Syd, I really do,</i>


1027
00:40:19.256 --> 00:40:20.823
<i>but you know,
there's a big reward out there</i>


1028
00:40:20.825 --> 00:40:22.197
<i>for anyone who finds me,</i>

1029
00:40:22.199 --> 00:40:23.702
<i>and you wouldn't want Peter
or your mom</i>


1030
00:40:23.704 --> 00:40:25.430
<i>to get accused of dog-napping.</i>

1031
00:40:25.432 --> 00:40:26.804
So where will you go?

1032
00:40:26.806 --> 00:40:28.054
<i>I'm not sure
about that Isaac.</i>


1033
00:40:28.056 --> 00:40:30.677
<i>I'm thinking either Okinawa
or the Belgian Congo.</i>


1034
00:40:30.679 --> 00:40:31.700
Never been there.

1035
00:40:31.702 --> 00:40:33.492
<i>Neither has anyone else,
I suspect.</i>


1036
00:40:33.494 --> 00:40:35.283
Will you be after school
at least?


1037
00:40:35.285 --> 00:40:36.403
<i>Sure, I'll wait for ya,</i>

1038
00:40:36.405 --> 00:40:37.970
<i>can't leave without
saying goodbye, right?</i>


1039
00:40:37.972 --> 00:40:39.986
<i>I'm right, right? 
Am I right?</i>

1040
00:40:39.988 --> 00:40:42.801
Okay then, I'll see you
when class lets out at 3:00.


1041
00:40:42.803 --> 00:40:45.233
<i>Righty-o! So long for now kids.</i>

1042
00:40:45.235 --> 00:40:46.192
<i>Oh, hey, kiddo,
you wouldn't happen</i>


1043
00:40:46.194 --> 00:40:48.112
<i>to have another cookie,
would ya?</i>


1044
00:40:48.114 --> 00:40:49.840
<i>Huh, I'm begging.
Look, I'm begging.</i>


1045
00:40:49.842 --> 00:40:51.665
Make it last
until end of school, okay?


1046
00:40:51.667 --> 00:40:53.328
<i>Most certainly.</i>

1047
00:40:53.330 --> 00:40:54.704
<i>Oh, yellow, 
I love yellow.</i>

1048
00:40:54.706 --> 00:40:57.168
<i>Man, have I been missing this?</i>

1049
00:40:57.170 --> 00:41:00.557
<i>[Murph mumbling]</i>

1050
00:41:00.559 --> 00:41:01.550
Later, Murph.

1051
00:41:01.552 --> 00:41:03.950
<i>[barking]</i>

1052
00:41:03.952 --> 00:41:04.973
Oh, hey, wait a minute...

1053
00:41:04.975 --> 00:41:06.765
Oh, hang on a second,
I buried a bone back here.


1054
00:41:06.767 --> 00:41:08.813
Yeah, I got to get the bone,
it's by the tree by the lake.


1055
00:41:08.815 --> 00:41:11.887
Tree by the lake.
Bone by the tree by the lake.


1056
00:41:12.493 --> 00:41:14.859
[Phone ringing]

1057
00:41:14.861 --> 00:41:16.426
Yeah, hello,
Principal Callahan's office.


1058
00:41:16.428 --> 00:41:17.771
May I help you?

1059
00:41:17.773 --> 00:41:18.827
<i>[Maurice] It's Maurice
in maintenance.</i>


1060
00:41:18.829 --> 00:41:19.658
<i>I gotta talk to him.</i>

1061
00:41:19.660 --> 00:41:21.450
I'm sorry, you'll have to
call back.


1062
00:41:21.452 --> 00:41:22.537
He's on the other line,
and he's got two


1063
00:41:22.539 --> 00:41:24.010
Hollywood people waiting.

1064
00:41:24.012 --> 00:41:25.098
<i>[Maurice] All right.</i>

1065
00:41:25.100 --> 00:41:27.177
Yeah, well, you gotta
ask yourself one question son.


1066
00:41:27.179 --> 00:41:27.690
<i>[Voiceover] What?</i>

1067
00:41:27.692 --> 00:41:28.842
Do you feel lucky?

1068
00:41:28.844 --> 00:41:29.992
<i>[Voiceover] I don't know.</i>

1069
00:41:29.994 --> 00:41:31.687
Well, do you punk?

1070
00:41:31.689 --> 00:41:32.584
<i>[Voiceover] Please let me
do it over.</i>


1071
00:41:32.586 --> 00:41:33.352
<i>Please.</i>

1072
00:41:33.354 --> 00:41:35.110
All right then,
come back Monday.


1073
00:41:35.112 --> 00:41:37.321
You can take the test over.

1074
00:41:39.016 --> 00:41:40.967
Let me see
if I've got this straight.


1075
00:41:40.969 --> 00:41:44.485
You two gentlemen
are missing a dog,


1076
00:41:44.487 --> 00:41:45.702
and you think one or more

1077
00:41:45.704 --> 00:41:47.269
of my student's
may have stolen it?


1078
00:41:47.271 --> 00:41:50.149
Is that about right?

1079
00:41:50.151 --> 00:41:51.045
Yeah.

1080
00:41:51.047 --> 00:41:52.932
But you don't have a shred
of evidence.


1081
00:41:52.934 --> 00:41:54.370
You're not sure which kids,
because you weren't


1082
00:41:54.372 --> 00:41:56.196
close enough to
make a positive ID.


1083
00:41:56.198 --> 00:41:58.499
Yet, the only thing
that you remember positively


1084
00:41:58.501 --> 00:42:01.025
is that one of the kids
may have had a yo-yo?


1085
00:42:01.027 --> 00:42:02.787
I'd stake my career on it.

1086
00:42:02.789 --> 00:42:04.320
- Yeah, me too.
- Yeah.


1087
00:42:04.322 --> 00:42:05.506
And now you want me to

1088
00:42:05.508 --> 00:42:06.882
give you free run of the school

1089
00:42:06.884 --> 00:42:10.528
so you can track down
this alleged kid with a yo-yo?


1090
00:42:10.530 --> 00:42:12.129
We'd appreciate that, yeah.

1091
00:42:12.131 --> 00:42:14.015
Yeah, if you don't mind, sir.

1092
00:42:14.017 --> 00:42:15.263
Yeah, well,
as a matter of fact


1093
00:42:15.265 --> 00:42:18.142
I do mind, strenuously.

1094
00:42:18.144 --> 00:42:21.278
You dudes get lost,
hear now?


1095
00:42:21.280 --> 00:42:21.951
But...

1096
00:42:21.953 --> 00:42:22.845
Drop it!

1097
00:42:22.847 --> 00:42:25.020
The only yo-yos around here

- [Harry] Yeah.</i>

Yes, um, he'll have to

1117
00:43:09.110 --> 00:43:13.139
So what do we do now?

1118
00:43:13.141 --> 00:43:14.037
Go get the car,

1119
00:43:14.039 --> 00:43:15.989
park it around the corner
out of sight.


1120
00:43:15.991 --> 00:43:17.138
We're going to wait
until school lets out


1121
00:43:17.140 --> 00:43:21.649
and then we're going to keep
our eyes peeled for a yo-yo.

No, help yourself.

Well now, despite you being
a talking dog and all,


1145
00:44:31.462 --> 00:44:34.724
that certainly does call
for a response.

<i>Mm, Jonathan, I can see

[Laughs] No silly.

Now that I'm conversing
with a checker playing dog

1254
00:48:19.834 --> 00:48:22.038
I, I'm sorry, I think Howdy's
just a little nervous today.


1255
00:48:22.040 --> 00:48:23.701
Yeah, it's okay,
I understand.


1256
00:48:23.703 --> 00:48:26.997
I have those days myself,
all the time actually.


1257
00:48:26.999 --> 00:48:28.757
We will let you know.

1258

Thank you from the both of us.

it is to finally


1262
00:48:38.453 --> 00:48:41.235
say goodbye to Howdy.

1263
00:48:41.237 --> 00:48:42.258
So, who do you like?

1264
00:48:42.260 --> 00:48:44.083
More like, who didn't I hate?

1265
00:48:44.085 --> 00:48:45.490
There was some cute ones.

1266
00:48:45.492 --> 00:48:47.410
Oh, Candace please,
they were dumb as a brick,

Some cute ones, but no one,
no one


1269
00:48:51.347 --> 00:48:53.329
holds a candle to Murphy.

1270
00:48:53.331 --> 00:48:54.288
So what do we do?

1271
00:48:54.290 --> 00:48:55.662
Not we, you.

1272
00:48:55.664 --> 00:48:57.167
I want you to get down
to the area


1273
00:48:57.169 --> 00:48:59.375
that Murphy got loose
and set up a command post.


1274
00:48:59.377 --> 00:49:01.519
I'm putting you in charge of
getting that dog back.

You understand?

1276
00:49:02.609 --> 00:49:04.846
But Quinn, I can't just go off
for who-knows-how-long


1277
00:49:04.848 --> 00:49:06.733
and leave Maitlin high and dry.

1278
00:49:06.735 --> 00:49:08.590
Okay, fine. Bring her along.

1279
00:49:08.592 --> 00:49:09.518
I couldn't do that.

1280
00:49:09.520 --> 00:49:10.126
Why not?

1281
00:49:10.128 --> 00:49:11.853
Next week is spring break.

1282
00:49:11.855 --> 00:49:14.252
I'm sure she'd like a little
mini-vacation with mama.


1283
00:49:14.254 --> 00:49:17.387
It'll give you some

Not so far.

1289
00:49:28.812 --> 00:49:30.153
Only glad my childhood
didn't consist


1290
00:49:30.155 --> 00:49:32.552
solely of texting on a
cellphone.


1291
00:49:32.554 --> 00:49:34.185
It's a whole new generation
out there, Joe.


1292
00:49:34.187 --> 00:49:35.591
It's not like when we grew up.

1293

These kids don't know
what they're missing.

Nobody talks anymore.

1295

At least the kid with the yo-yos
keeping it real.

You may have something
there, pal.

Don't answer that.

Principal Callahan


1307
00:50:03.844 --> 00:50:06.274
didn't catch you with that
in-between classes.


1308
00:50:06.276 --> 00:50:08.162
Yeah, he would've grabbed
it for sure.


1309
00:50:08.164 --> 00:50:09.089
I was careful.

1310
00:50:09.091 --> 00:50:11.968
He almost took my iPad
in the library once,


1311
00:50:11.970 --> 00:50:14.783
but I told him it I was using it
to look up a history question.

00:50:14.785 --> 00:50:16.288
Yeah, what were you
really doing?

00:50:18.593 --> 00:50:19.583
at the bake sale?

1316
00:50:19.585 --> 00:50:20.383
Sure did.

1317
00:50:20.385 --> 00:50:21.822
A dozen cream-filled cupcakes.
You?


1318
00:50:21.824 --> 00:50:23.455
Four blueberry pies.

1319
00:50:23.457 --> 00:50:24.573
My dad loves them.

1320

A double lemon

I got a bunch of Miss Miller's
chocolate eclairs for Peter.

So where's Murphy?

1326

You don't think he took
off or anything?


1327
00:50:38.909 --> 00:50:40.667
No, he promised
to stick around.


1328
00:50:40.669 --> 00:50:41.692
Someone could have grabbed him,

1329
00:50:41.694 --> 00:50:43.803
like the dog catcher
or the police.


1330

Oh, I hope not.

What do we do?

1351
00:51:26.227 --> 00:51:28.721
Let's pull around the back,
find a side road and wait.


1352
00:51:28.723 --> 00:51:30.800
Those kids will walk
right into our hands.


1353
00:51:30.802 --> 00:51:32.241
We won't have to do a thing.

Oh, my cheek.
Oh, the other cheek.


1572
01:00:45.093 --> 01:00:47.266
All right, I think that's about
enough for today,


1573
01:00:47.268 --> 01:00:48.833
why don't we pick it up again
Monday.


1574
01:00:48.835 --> 01:00:50.338
Thank Mr. Kirkland.

1575
01:00:50.340 --> 01:00:51.426
Absolutely.

1576
01:00:51.428 --> 01:00:53.632
You know, it's a real pleasure
for me to teach somebody


1577
01:00:53.634 --> 01:00:56.929
like you with such an open mind,
it really is.


1578
01:00:56.931 --> 01:00:58.177
All right, why don't I
help you into your room.


1579
01:00:58.179 --> 01:00:59.072
No, I got it.

1580
01:00:59.074 --> 01:00:59.969
All right.

1581
01:00:59.971 --> 01:01:01.311
You're getting pretty good
with that rig.


1582
01:01:01.313 --> 01:01:02.592
Yeah, you should see
my motorized one.


1583
01:01:02.594 --> 01:01:05.182
I can go 0 to 60 in under 15
second.


1584
01:01:05.184 --> 01:01:06.590
Really? Wow!

1585
01:01:06.592 --> 01:01:07.679
Well, you better keep it under

1586
01:01:07.681 --> 01:01:10.045
you don't want to put
any holes in these walls, right?


1587
01:01:10.047 --> 01:01:11.231
Yeah. See ya.

1588
01:01:11.233 --> 01:01:14.111
All right, see ya Monday.

1589
01:01:20.254 --> 01:01:21.436
How's he doing?

1590
01:01:21.438 --> 01:01:23.292
Academically, great.

1591
01:01:23.294 --> 01:01:24.251
No, I mean...

1592
01:01:24.253 --> 01:01:25.882
I know. I know.

1593
01:01:25.884 --> 01:01:27.131
I've tried to broach the subject

1594
01:01:27.133 --> 01:01:28.507
with him a couple
different times.


1595
01:01:28.509 --> 01:01:30.682
He just keeps saying
the same thing.


1596
01:01:30.684 --> 01:01:32.700
He can't do it.

1597
01:01:35.483 --> 01:01:37.720
<i>Hey, wait a minute here.</i>

1598
01:01:37.722 --> 01:01:39.352
Can't, or won't?

1599
01:01:39.354 --> 01:01:41.272
Honestly, I don't know.

1600
01:01:41.274 --> 01:01:42.328
His physical therapist
says there's nothing


1601
01:01:42.330 --> 01:01:44.982
radically wrong with his legs,
maybe just weakness


1602
01:01:44.984 --> 01:01:47.031
since the accident.

1603
01:01:47.033 --> 01:01:49.237
<i>Poor kid.</i>

1604
01:01:49.239 --> 01:01:51.798
they think more than likely
it's guilt keeping him


1605
01:01:51.800 --> 01:01:53.108
confined to that chair.

1606
01:01:53.110 --> 01:01:54.870
Guilt? I don't understand.

1607
01:01:54.872 --> 01:01:56.342
Guilt for not being able
to save his father


1608
01:01:56.344 --> 01:01:59.252
right after the accident.

1609
01:01:59.254 --> 01:02:00.499
[Groans]

1610
01:02:00.501 --> 01:02:02.709
Peter was thrown free,
John unfortunately wasn't.


1611
01:02:04.405 --> 01:02:05.620
It's been three years now
and he still hasn't


1612
01:02:05.622 --> 01:02:07.313
been able to bounce back.

1613
01:02:07.315 --> 01:02:09.523
Well, I hope he does soon,
because if he doesn't


1614
01:02:09.525 --> 01:02:11.794
his legs are going to
start to atrophy.


1615
01:02:11.796 --> 01:02:14.770
I pray you're right Michael.

1616
01:02:14.772 --> 01:02:16.176
To be honest with you,

1617
01:02:16.178 --> 01:02:17.936
my late husband's accident
insurance policy


1618
01:02:17.938 --> 01:02:20.400
will be running out shortly.

1619
01:02:20.402 --> 01:02:21.999
Without money coming in
we won't be able


1620
01:02:22.001 --> 01:02:25.264
to afford doctor visits,
or even you for that matter.


1621
01:02:25.266 --> 01:02:26.638
Oh, hey, hey, hey,
no, no, no.


1622
01:02:26.640 --> 01:02:28.687
Look, I've grown too
close to Pete and to you


1623
01:02:28.689 --> 01:02:31.437
to ever let money get in the way
of what I'm trying to do here,


1624
01:02:31.439 --> 01:02:33.101
so as far as I'm concerned,

1625
01:02:33.103 --> 01:02:35.725
you don't have to worry
about me, okay?


1626
01:02:35.727 --> 01:02:39.660
Michael, I just want him
to be well again.


1627
01:02:39.662 --> 01:02:42.638
<i>I got to do something
about this.</i>


1628
01:02:46.925 --> 01:02:48.522
How much longer, Mama?

1629
01:02:48.524 --> 01:02:49.770
Oh, about an hour or so.

1630
01:02:49.772 --> 01:02:52.138
It's nice around here,
reminds me


1631
01:02:52.140 --> 01:02:53.418
of when you and Dad used to

1632
01:02:53.420 --> 01:02:55.240
take vacations
when I was little.


1633
01:02:55.242 --> 01:02:57.064
Once upon a time.

1634
01:02:57.066 --> 01:02:58.984
Is this where they
film the show?


1635
01:02:58.986 --> 01:03:00.328
Most episodes.

1636
01:03:00.330 --> 01:03:02.248
The network loves the look.

1637
01:03:02.250 --> 01:03:04.072
Maybe that's why
Murphy ran away.


1638
01:03:04.074 --> 01:03:06.502
If I were a dog,
I'd love living here.


1639
01:03:06.504 --> 01:03:09.765
It's so open and peaceful.

1640
01:03:09.767 --> 01:03:11.590
Murphy lives in Hollywood,
Honey.


1641
01:03:11.592 --> 01:03:14.628
He's treated very well there,
he's got the best of everything.


1642
01:03:14.630 --> 01:03:16.484
Does he live in a big house
like we do?


1643
01:03:16.486 --> 01:03:19.076
A big private kennel, actually,

1644
01:03:19.078 --> 01:03:21.828
almost as big as
grandma's house in Maine.


1645
01:03:21.830 --> 01:03:25.091
Is there someone there
who really loves him?


1646
01:03:25.093 --> 01:03:27.715
Well, there are people there
who help him


1647
01:03:27.717 --> 01:03:29.761
with whatever he needs.

1648
01:03:29.763 --> 01:03:31.426
I guess that's okay,
but not really


1649
01:03:31.428 --> 01:03:34.338
if there's no one there
who truly cares.


1650
01:03:34.340 --> 01:03:37.504
Do you care, Mama?

1651
01:03:37.506 --> 01:03:39.647
Mama, I asked
if you care,


1652
01:03:39.649 --> 01:03:43.233
about Murphy I mean.

1653
01:03:43.235 --> 01:03:45.022
Of course I do, Honey.

1654
01:03:45.024 --> 01:03:47.807
Of course I do.

1655
01:03:47.809 --> 01:03:51.744
Not just because
of your job, right?


1656
01:03:55.006 --> 01:03:57.790
[phone ringing]

1657
01:03:58.686 --> 01:03:59.804
Yes?

1658
01:03:59.806 --> 01:04:02.268
Ma'am, we have a possible
address on the missing dog.


1659
01:04:02.270 --> 01:04:04.571
Call the police, go to it,
do your job.


1660
01:04:04.573 --> 01:04:06.587
Yeah, well, ma'am,
it's not that easy.


1661
01:04:06.589 --> 01:04:08.378
You see, we have reason
to believe


1662
01:04:08.380 --> 01:04:09.818
that the dog is in the
hands of some kids.


1663
01:04:09.820 --> 01:04:10.586
So?

1664
01:04:10.588 --> 01:04:12.666
Well, so it's getting
dark soon.


1665
01:04:12.668 --> 01:04:13.721
If we go out there loaded
for bear,


1666
01:04:13.723 --> 01:04:15.641
half a dozen black and whites,

1667
01:04:15.643 --> 01:04:17.465
those kids will take that dog
so deep into the woods


1668
01:04:17.467 --> 01:04:18.552
we may never get him back.

1669
01:04:18.554 --> 01:04:19.640
Then what do you suggest?

1670
01:04:19.642 --> 01:04:20.697
Wait until morning.

1671
01:04:20.699 --> 01:04:22.487
Joe and I will drive out there
real friendly like,


1672
01:04:22.489 --> 01:04:23.575
pay them a visit.

1673
01:04:23.577 --> 01:04:25.240
It's Saturday morning
and they won't be expecting us,


1674
01:04:25.242 --> 01:04:26.263
the parents and the kids
will be home,


1675
01:04:26.265 --> 01:04:29.335
we'll certainly get that dog
back in good order.


1676
01:04:29.337 --> 01:04:30.262
Okay.

1677
01:04:30.264 --> 01:04:31.030
Where are you staying?

1678
01:04:31.032 --> 01:04:32.853
Where at the
Horsey Manor Motel


1679
01:04:32.855 --> 01:04:35.030
off the 14 near Fairvale.

1680
01:04:35.032 --> 01:04:37.108
Go book a room for
my daughter and myself,


1681
01:04:37.110 --> 01:04:38.868
we'll be there in less
than a half.


1682
01:04:38.870 --> 01:04:40.756
Will do, ma'am.

1683
01:04:40.758 --> 01:04:41.779
She coming here?

1684
01:04:41.781 --> 01:04:42.740
With her kid!

01:04:42.742 --> 01:04:43.988
Oh, perfect!

1686
01:04:43.990 --> 01:04:45.716
What was I supposed to do?

1687
01:04:45.718 --> 01:04:46.611
I'll go book them a room.

1688
01:04:46.613 --> 01:04:48.531
One far away from ours,
if you don't mind.


1689
01:04:48.533 --> 01:04:50.673
Yeah, will do.

Can I come with you
tomorrow, Mama?


1692
01:04:57.491 --> 01:05:00.144
Without a babysitter
I guess I have no choice,


1693
01:05:00.146 --> 01:05:02.032
but why so much interest
in Murphy?


1694
01:05:02.034 --> 01:05:05.455
- I want to see who he picked.
- Picked? I don't understand.


1695
01:05:05.457 --> 01:05:07.663
I read in the book once,
that dogs choose their owners,


1696
01:05:07.665 --> 01:05:09.294
not the other way around.

1697
01:05:09.296 --> 01:05:11.501
And since Murphy really had
no one who loved him


1698
01:05:11.503 --> 01:05:14.382
he must have chosen
someone after he got away.


1699
01:05:14.384 --> 01:05:16.399
I'd like to see who.

1700
01:05:19.118 --> 01:05:21.806
Let's hope we get the chance.

1701
01:05:24.077 --> 01:05:25.867
I can't believe we got away.

1702

<i>Dangerous?</i>

So now what?

Yeah, really.

But it would mean telling
her about Murphy.


1727
01:06:06.246 --> 01:06:08.386
Hey, we should have told
her already.


1728

You're right, hopefully.

1729
01:06:09.988 --> 01:06:11.426
Murph, can you stay here
for a sec?


1730
01:06:11.428 --> 01:06:14.562
<i>Sure, you guys go ahead,
just leave the TV on.</i>

<i>I won't.</i>

01:06:37.087 --> 01:06:40.988
Yeah, what you doing?

1742
01:06:40.990 --> 01:06:42.845
Oh, kiddos, to be
quite honest with you,


1743
01:06:42.847 --> 01:06:44.764
I'm figuring who
I have to pay now


1744
01:06:44.766 --> 01:06:46.459
and who I can stall
for a couple of weeks.


1745
01:06:46.461 --> 01:06:48.347
Is our money really that low?

1746
01:06:48.349 --> 01:06:50.491
Mm, let's just say
it's a bit tight.

I'm sorry, you can have

1748

the money from my
piggy bank if you want.


1749
01:06:54.555 --> 01:06:55.449
Mine too.

1750

I love you guys for offering,

1751
01:06:56.860 --> 01:06:59.385
but it hasn't come to that
quite yet.


1752
01:06:59.387 --> 01:07:02.137
Now, what brings both you
out here at once?

Something must be up.

No, that's fine.

1756

We just wanted to ask you
a question.


1757

I'm honored.
What can I do for you?


1758
01:07:12.407 --> 01:07:15.029
You know that dog
who went missing


1759
01:07:15.031 --> 01:07:17.428
and is also on TV?

1760
01:07:17.430 --> 01:07:19.924
Yeah, Murphy?
He's in all the headlines.


1761
01:07:19.926 --> 01:07:24.630
Yeah, well, he's, um,
he's also in my bedroom.

[laughs] What? 
You're joking.

We're not.

1764
01:07:30.901 --> 01:07:32.754
You didn't dog-nap him
did you?


1765
01:07:32.756 --> 01:07:36.656
Not exactly, he just kind of
followed me home from the set


1766
01:07:36.658 --> 01:07:39.121
a couple days ago.

1767
01:07:39.123 --> 01:07:40.432
Well, Syd, we have to
return him to his

1769

Everyone's looking for him.

1770
01:07:44.114 --> 01:07:46.223
But his rightful owners
don't love him.


1771
01:07:46.225 --> 01:07:47.919
Yeah, they treat him awful.

1772
01:07:47.921 --> 01:07:49.871
They keep him locked
up in a cage,


1773
01:07:49.873 --> 01:07:52.493
don't play with him,
and the worst of all


1774
01:07:52.495 --> 01:07:54.319
they don't even pet him.

1775
01:07:56.655 --> 01:07:58.316
And just how do you
know all of this.

could easily fall in love,

Thanks, Gwen.

Next to loyalty,

Two of your men dropped by
yesterday and

01:09:12.608 --> 01:09:14.717
alerted me to your
missing dog problem.

That's right.

Well, this is the

That's wonderful Sherriff.

If you want to go over there
tonight

I can send a black and white

I think this can wait
until tomorrow.

Well, I think that's a wise
decision.

you over there myself.
