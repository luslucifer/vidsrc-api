1
00:00:44.388 --> 00:00:48.591
Miss Sally,
you asked me to remind you


2
00:00:48.659 --> 00:00:50.326
when we were 30 minutes out.

3
00:00:50.361 --> 00:00:51.828
Oh, so I did.

4
00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:54.364
Well...

5
00:01:15.986 --> 00:01:18.788
You will look after him,
won't you?


6
00:01:22.393 --> 00:01:24.327
Of course you will.

7
00:01:24.361 --> 00:01:27.897
Oh, you always have.

8
00:01:50.954 --> 00:01:53.856
Ma'am, she's here.

9
00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:04.133
Come in.

10
00:02:04.201 --> 00:02:07.904
.Anderson has arrived.

11
00:02:12.309 --> 00:02:18.448
I hear, um, St. Thomas is just
lovely this time of year.


12
00:02:18.482 --> 00:02:21.684
First things first, shall we?

13
00:02:21.719 --> 00:02:24.153
All right.

14
00:02:24.188 --> 00:02:26.289
Tell Mr. Colby
we're making every effort


15
00:02:26.323 --> 00:02:28.391
to settle his father's
estate expeditiously.


16
00:02:28.425 --> 00:02:31.894
I don't how much longer I can
keep him leashed before he sues.


17
00:02:31.929 --> 00:02:33.763
You might consider replacing
his leash with a choke chain.


18
00:02:33.831 --> 00:02:35.398
I take threats seriously.

19
00:02:35.432 --> 00:02:36.566
Here you go, Kelly.

20
00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:38.234
Thank you so much.

21
00:02:38.268 --> 00:02:40.036
- Well, take care.
- Thanks.


22
00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:42.438
Why, Kelly,
you look lovely!


23
00:02:42.473 --> 00:02:44.273
Thank you, miss Sally.

24
00:02:44.308 --> 00:02:46.442
It's so wonderful
to see you again.


25
00:02:46.477 --> 00:02:49.479
And that's for the office.

26
00:02:49.513 --> 00:02:54.217
So, tell me, have you found
Mr. right yet?


27
00:02:54.284 --> 00:02:57.620
Still looking.
No keepers yet.


28
00:02:57.654 --> 00:02:59.489
Oh.

29
00:02:59.523 --> 00:03:02.692
Oh, thank you.
I, uh, rode my bike in today.


30
00:03:02.726 --> 00:03:04.026
I...

31
00:03:04.061 --> 00:03:05.495
Oh, miss Sally.

32
00:03:05.529 --> 00:03:08.498
Always a treat!

33
00:03:08.532 --> 00:03:10.199
Yes.

34
00:03:10.234 --> 00:03:11.701
Mr. Hamilton
is expecting you.


35
00:03:11.735 --> 00:03:13.936
Thank you.

36
00:03:13.971 --> 00:03:15.638
- Well, later.
Bye-bye.


37
00:03:21.412 --> 00:03:24.247
I know you don't take cream.

38
00:03:24.281 --> 00:03:26.115
I remembered.

39
00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:27.650
Oh, wonderful.

40
00:03:27.684 --> 00:03:30.953
You do know
Mr. Hamilton is retired.


41
00:03:30.988 --> 00:03:33.156
Miss Sally,
you know that we'd been glad


42
00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:34.891
to come to you.

43
00:03:34.925 --> 00:03:38.594
We enjoy any excuse to
visit Anderson house.


44
00:03:38.662 --> 00:03:40.897
Well, nonsense.

45
00:03:40.931 --> 00:03:43.433
You know I enjoy getting out.

46
00:03:43.467 --> 00:03:46.202
Sister, what do we owe
this honor?


47
00:03:46.236 --> 00:03:49.939
Well, I'm afraid there's
no delicate way to put this.


48
00:03:49.973 --> 00:03:52.442
I've come to make
final arrangements.


49
00:03:54.278 --> 00:03:56.512
Uh, for Anderson house.

50
00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:59.482
I'd like it to go
to my grandson, Joey.


51
00:03:59.516 --> 00:04:00.883
You do know that Joey

52
00:04:00.951 --> 00:04:02.552
can't take care
of Anderson house.


53
00:04:02.619 --> 00:04:04.554
Now, now,
don't be so hard on the boy.


54
00:04:04.621 --> 00:04:08.057
Besides, I'm afraid
there's no time for debate.


55
00:04:08.091 --> 00:04:11.828
You see, I have been told...

56
00:04:11.862 --> 00:04:13.930
That I have less than a month.

57
00:04:13.997 --> 00:04:15.565
Excuse me?

58
00:04:15.599 --> 00:04:17.967
This comes as quite a shock.

59
00:04:18.035 --> 00:04:23.139
Joey can't possibly
manage Anderson house.


60
00:04:23.207 --> 00:04:27.844
Ted, Anderson house
doesn't need Joey.


61
00:04:27.911 --> 00:04:32.582
Why, hawthorne, Claudia, and
Oscar handle the day to day,


62
00:04:32.616 --> 00:04:35.051
but Joey does need
Anderson house,


63
00:04:35.118 --> 00:04:39.155
and he is our only link
to the family legacy.


64
00:04:39.189 --> 00:04:41.724
Your wishes
will be fulfilled.


65
00:04:41.758 --> 00:04:43.159
Thank you.

66
00:04:43.193 --> 00:04:45.228
Then the rest
is merely details.


67
00:04:45.262 --> 00:04:48.564
Everything is here.

68
00:04:48.599 --> 00:04:53.302
My final request of you
is that you make it legal.


69
00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:54.937
It's not
going to be easy.


70
00:04:54.972 --> 00:04:57.974
Thank you, Ted.

71
00:04:58.008 --> 00:04:59.775
Thank you.

72
00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:01.777
You're welcome.

73
00:05:01.812 --> 00:05:04.347
Thank you.

74
00:05:11.488 --> 00:05:13.322
Miss Hastings:

75
00:05:13.357 --> 00:05:16.225
Ah, I'll see you out,
miss Sally.


76
00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:18.494
Oh, that won't be
necessary, darling.


77
00:05:18.529 --> 00:05:22.331
Oh, and, uh,
when you do find a keeper,


78
00:05:22.366 --> 00:05:25.401
make sure he can keep up.

79
00:05:39.416 --> 00:05:41.851
I'm almost there.
Can you give me a biner?


80
00:05:41.885 --> 00:05:43.052
Yeah.

81
00:05:45.989 --> 00:05:47.823
- Hey, Joey.
- Yeah?


82
00:05:47.858 --> 00:05:49.191
I think
we got company, man.


83
00:05:49.226 --> 00:05:51.894
Oh, thanks, lino.

84
00:05:54.031 --> 00:05:56.766
Hey, lino, can you lower me?

85
00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:57.967
Lowering.

86
00:06:02.105 --> 00:06:04.607
On command?
I wish.


87
00:06:04.641 --> 00:06:06.776
I thought about it, though.

88
00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:08.344
Who is this guy?

89
00:06:08.412 --> 00:06:10.913
I don't know. Kgb?

90
00:06:10.948 --> 00:06:12.281
You serious?

91
00:06:12.316 --> 00:06:13.883
No, I'm not serious.

92
00:06:13.951 --> 00:06:15.184
I can't ever tell if
you're telling the truth.


93
00:06:15.218 --> 00:06:16.852
Dude, just stop talking.

94
00:06:16.887 --> 00:06:18.054
- Mr. Anderson.
- Yeah.


95
00:06:18.121 --> 00:06:19.522
I'm ulrik keel.

96
00:06:19.556 --> 00:06:20.990
Okay.

97
00:06:21.024 --> 00:06:23.593
You're needed
at Anderson house.


98
00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:25.394
Nobody called me.

99
00:06:25.429 --> 00:06:28.164
Your phone has been
disconnected.


100
00:06:28.198 --> 00:06:30.633
My phone's been disconnected.

101
00:06:32.569 --> 00:06:35.371
What's going on here?

102
00:06:35.405 --> 00:06:40.509
Mr. Anderson, your
grandmother has passed away.


103
00:06:43.947 --> 00:06:45.648
Oh.

104
00:06:45.682 --> 00:06:48.117
Uh, hey, guys,

105
00:06:48.151 --> 00:06:50.853
can you...

106
00:06:50.887 --> 00:06:52.989
Can you drive the jeep back
to the cabin for me?


107
00:06:53.023 --> 00:06:54.323
Thanks.

108
00:06:56.593 --> 00:07:00.229
Who are you exactly?

109
00:07:00.263 --> 00:07:02.531
Your grandmother
and I are...


110
00:07:02.566 --> 00:07:06.869
<i>Were</i> very close.

111
00:07:06.903 --> 00:07:10.139
I'm here to take you home.

112
00:07:12.275 --> 00:07:16.078
Yeah. Let's go.

113
00:07:16.113 --> 00:07:18.114
Hey, lino.

114
00:07:22.386 --> 00:07:22.918
Ohh!

115
00:07:22.953 --> 00:07:24.453
Chloe:

116
00:07:24.521 --> 00:07:27.657
Ohh! Oh. Ohh.

117
00:07:27.724 --> 00:07:30.259
Hey, hey, hey, are my
kids making messes again?


118
00:07:30.293 --> 00:07:31.761
Yes, we are!

119
00:07:33.063 --> 00:07:34.497
Hello.

120
00:07:34.564 --> 00:07:38.701
Oh, hi, Ted.
Uh, yes, he's right here.


121
00:07:41.038 --> 00:07:42.638
Hi, Ted.

122
00:07:44.141 --> 00:07:45.474
Yeah, yeah.

123
00:07:45.509 --> 00:07:47.677
No. I just got your text now.

124
00:07:47.711 --> 00:07:51.313
Yeah, of course, of course.
I'll be right there.


125
00:07:51.348 --> 00:07:52.481
Okay, bye.

126
00:07:54.851 --> 00:07:57.853
You have to go now?

127
00:07:57.888 --> 00:07:58.854
I'm sorry.

128
00:07:58.889 --> 00:08:00.423
Alexia:

129
00:08:00.457 --> 00:08:02.091
I'm sorry.
I'll be back soon.


130
00:08:02.125 --> 00:08:02.725
You better be.

131
00:08:04.094 --> 00:08:07.229
Jason, thank you
for joining us.


132
00:08:07.264 --> 00:08:09.131
Of course.

133
00:08:09.199 --> 00:08:14.236
Miss Sally mae
Anderson was my first referral.


134
00:08:14.238 --> 00:08:15.004
And many famous personalities.

135
00:08:15.038 --> 00:08:17.473
More humanitarian work

136
00:08:17.507 --> 00:08:21.110
was done around the dining room
table of Anderson house


137
00:08:21.178 --> 00:08:23.245
than any boardroom in the world.

138
00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:25.715
Sadly, she passed away.

139
00:08:25.749 --> 00:08:30.219
She left her grandson a
significant monetary legacy


140
00:08:30.253 --> 00:08:32.154
with a few stipulations.

141
00:08:32.222 --> 00:08:33.956
That sounds familiar.

142
00:08:33.990 --> 00:08:35.591
Hm.

143
00:08:35.625 --> 00:08:37.960
Poppy, why did you
call us in here?


144
00:08:37.994 --> 00:08:40.830
I didn't know miss Sally other
than what I heard from you.


145
00:08:40.864 --> 00:08:43.265
Or that she had a grandson.

146
00:08:43.300 --> 00:08:47.036
We need your help.

147
00:08:47.070 --> 00:08:49.338
Angelica, you and Kelly

148
00:08:49.372 --> 00:08:51.474
will handle the legal side.

149
00:08:51.508 --> 00:08:55.211
Jason, I know that you
have a foundation to run


150
00:08:55.245 --> 00:08:59.515
and that you're very busy,
but I have a unique request.


151
00:08:59.549 --> 00:09:03.385
I'd like you to be just
a little more... hands on.


152
00:09:03.420 --> 00:09:09.792
We know you three can do this.

153
00:09:15.432 --> 00:09:18.501
I'll do my best.

154
00:09:18.535 --> 00:09:19.969
Uh, Mr. Stevens,

155
00:09:20.003 --> 00:09:22.238
I look forward
to working with you.


156
00:09:22.305 --> 00:09:24.373
Likewise.
Just call me Jason.


157
00:09:24.407 --> 00:09:25.708
Okay.

158
00:09:27.410 --> 00:09:29.879
Jason, I'd like you
to be at the funeral


159
00:09:29.913 --> 00:09:35.684
so you can help Joey understand
his new circumstances.


160
00:09:35.719 --> 00:09:38.287
Once you read the documents,
you'll understand.


161
00:09:38.321 --> 00:09:40.456
Oh, I'm sure I will, poppy.

162
00:09:40.490 --> 00:09:42.391
Don't you ever call me
that in public.


163
00:09:42.425 --> 00:09:43.793
Never. Poppy.

164
00:09:43.827 --> 00:09:45.528
Now get out of here.

165
00:09:50.834 --> 00:09:51.066
Angelica:

166
00:09:53.103 --> 00:09:56.906
Entitled "cornerstones,"

167
00:09:56.940 --> 00:10:01.944
which she learned from our
mutual friend, red Stevens.


168
00:10:01.978 --> 00:10:08.584
"If I am to dream,
let me dream magnificently.


169
00:10:08.618 --> 00:10:15.191
Let me dream grand and lofty
thoughts and ideals


170
00:10:15.225 --> 00:10:18.994
that are worthy of me

171
00:10:19.029 --> 00:10:22.131
and my best efforts."

172
00:10:33.543 --> 00:10:35.611
Oh, dear.

173
00:10:35.645 --> 00:10:37.246
Ma'am, can I help you?

174
00:10:37.280 --> 00:10:38.747
Why, yes, yes.

175
00:10:38.782 --> 00:10:40.649
I have a flat tire.

176
00:10:40.684 --> 00:10:42.284
Yeah, I see that.

177
00:10:42.319 --> 00:10:44.920
I have no idea
where the, uh, the Jack is.


178
00:10:44.955 --> 00:10:47.189
I have never changed
a tire in my life.


179
00:10:47.257 --> 00:10:48.657
Well, neither have I,
but no worries,


180
00:10:48.692 --> 00:10:50.559
- I'll just search it.
- Okay.


181
00:10:50.627 --> 00:10:51.861
Where do you find
the Jack on a...


182
00:10:54.865 --> 00:10:57.233
Right.

183
00:10:57.267 --> 00:10:59.201
Can I borrow your phone?

184
00:10:59.236 --> 00:11:00.903
Yes, yes, my phone.

185
00:11:00.937 --> 00:11:03.405
It's right here.

186
00:11:05.141 --> 00:11:08.811
Okay, well,
so much for that.


187
00:11:10.413 --> 00:11:11.714
Where were you headed?

188
00:11:11.748 --> 00:11:13.482
A funeral.

189
00:11:25.328 --> 00:11:29.765
♪ Nearer, my God, to thee

190
00:11:29.833 --> 00:11:35.771
♪ nearer to thee

191
00:11:35.839 --> 00:11:42.278

00:11:42.312 --> 00:11:48.484
♪ that raiseth me

193
00:11:48.518 --> 00:11:52.454

194
00:11:52.489 --> 00:11:55.024
Dropped him off
to get his bike.


195
00:11:55.058 --> 00:11:56.792
Ahh.

196
00:11:56.826 --> 00:12:03.098
♪ Nearer, my God, to thee

197
00:12:03.166 --> 00:12:10.706

Gus:

202
00:12:30.727 --> 00:12:34.330
Miss Sally mae Anderson
lived an incredible life.


203
00:12:34.364 --> 00:12:39.101
She would want us
to celebrate her memory.


204
00:12:39.169 --> 00:12:41.704
But most of all,
she would want us


205
00:12:41.738 --> 00:12:45.107
to honor her legacy
by embracing the future


206
00:12:45.141 --> 00:12:49.111
with the same respect, love,

207
00:12:49.145 --> 00:12:53.182
hard work, and wisdom

208
00:12:53.249 --> 00:12:55.150
that are the foundation

209
00:12:55.185 --> 00:12:58.687
of Anderson house's
many successes.


210
00:13:09.799 --> 00:13:12.167
You must be Hamilton.

211
00:13:12.202 --> 00:13:14.903
It's "Mr. Hamilton" to you.

212
00:13:14.971 --> 00:13:18.440
Okay, Mr. Hamilton,
I'm Joey.


213
00:13:18.508 --> 00:13:20.242
I know who you are.

214
00:13:20.276 --> 00:13:22.678
All right, I understand
that my grandmother


215
00:13:22.712 --> 00:13:25.080
trusted the execution of
the estate to your firm.


216
00:13:25.115 --> 00:13:28.717
He's all yours.

217
00:13:30.887 --> 00:13:33.322
Well,<i>he's</i> charming.

218
00:13:33.356 --> 00:13:36.492
We'll be
handling all the legal affairs


219
00:13:36.526 --> 00:13:37.960
regarding the estate.

220
00:13:37.994 --> 00:13:40.462
Just tell me
what I need to do.


221
00:13:40.497 --> 00:13:42.398
We'll meet in two hours.

222
00:13:42.465 --> 00:13:45.200
Oscar will show you
to your room.


223
00:13:45.235 --> 00:13:46.702
I know where my room is.

224
00:13:54.010 --> 00:13:55.711
Can you tell me
what's going on here?


225
00:13:55.745 --> 00:13:58.147
We'll see you
in two hours.


226
00:14:01.885 --> 00:14:03.952
Before we go to my room,

227
00:14:03.987 --> 00:14:06.622
there's someone we need
to take care of.


228
00:14:13.029 --> 00:14:15.097
Thanks, buddy.

229
00:14:19.736 --> 00:14:21.236
All right.

230
00:14:21.271 --> 00:14:24.173
Just tell me what I need to sign
so I can leave.


231
00:14:24.207 --> 00:14:26.475
Unfortunately, Mr. Anderson,

232
00:14:26.509 --> 00:14:28.644
it's not that simple.

233
00:14:28.678 --> 00:14:33.348
Angelica will fill you in
all the legalities,


234
00:14:33.383 --> 00:14:38.387
and Jason Stevens here will
handle everything else.


235
00:14:42.058 --> 00:14:45.594
Joey, hi, I'm alexia.
I'm Jason's wife.


236
00:14:45.628 --> 00:14:47.729
I'm so sorry for your loss.

237
00:14:47.764 --> 00:14:49.231
Thank you.

238
00:14:50.834 --> 00:14:53.102
- Bye.
- See you later.


239
00:14:53.136 --> 00:14:54.470
I'll see you at home.

240
00:14:54.504 --> 00:14:55.804
Bye, baby girl.

241
00:14:55.839 --> 00:14:57.372
I'll see you later, okay?

242
00:15:02.946 --> 00:15:06.648
I truly am sorry
for your loss.


243
00:15:09.352 --> 00:15:12.554
Wait a second,
miss Hastings.


244
00:15:12.589 --> 00:15:16.291
I'm the only person
at this meeting


245
00:15:16.359 --> 00:15:20.095
who's an heir to
my family's estate, am I right?


246
00:15:20.130 --> 00:15:21.396
Your point?

247
00:15:21.431 --> 00:15:23.799
Is there
someone else listed


248
00:15:23.833 --> 00:15:25.634
in my grandmother's
will here?


249
00:15:25.668 --> 00:15:27.736
Is that why I'm getting
the runaround?


250
00:15:32.008 --> 00:15:34.209
There are over

251
00:15:34.277 --> 00:15:35.878
in this file.

252
00:15:35.945 --> 00:15:39.882
As partner in my grandfather,
Mr. Hamilton's, firm


253
00:15:39.916 --> 00:15:46.388
I'm charged with executing
this "legally binding" document.


254
00:15:46.422 --> 00:15:49.224
Okay, so, what?

255
00:15:49.259 --> 00:15:50.692
Are you charging by the hour,

256
00:15:50.727 --> 00:15:52.027
or how are you getting a piece
of this pie?


257
00:15:52.061 --> 00:15:53.462
Um, Mr. Anderson...

258
00:15:53.530 --> 00:15:55.464
Just Joey, actually.
What's your name?


259
00:15:55.498 --> 00:16:00.235
Uh, Kelly, but you can
call me miss James.


260
00:16:00.270 --> 00:16:04.039
Um, you actually haven't
inherited anything.


261
00:16:04.107 --> 00:16:05.841
Well, great, fine.

262
00:16:05.875 --> 00:16:09.144
Well, in that case,
I better be going.


263
00:16:09.179 --> 00:16:12.648
Excuse me, I have some
travel arrangements to make.


264
00:16:34.337 --> 00:16:34.369
Mr. Anderson just realized

265
00:16:36.139 --> 00:16:38.040
his credit cards
have been canceled.


266
00:16:38.107 --> 00:16:41.910
Well, at least
he's not on a date.


267
00:16:41.978 --> 00:16:44.012
Good luck.

268
00:16:44.047 --> 00:16:45.647
♪ Rain down on me

269
00:16:51.721 --> 00:16:53.555
good luck, dudes.

270
00:17:04.801 --> 00:17:06.435
Come in!

271
00:17:10.340 --> 00:17:11.773
Great sound!

272
00:17:11.808 --> 00:17:14.176
Yeah, I love this guy!

273
00:17:17.413 --> 00:17:21.416
Okay, my phone's dead,

274
00:17:21.484 --> 00:17:23.685
and all my credit cards
have been canceled.


275
00:17:23.720 --> 00:17:27.422
Your trust terminated
with miss Sally's passing.


276
00:17:27.457 --> 00:17:29.191
How do you figure
in all this?


277
00:17:29.225 --> 00:17:31.593
Uh, miss Sally
and my grandfather were close.


278
00:17:31.628 --> 00:17:33.462
I was asked to help.

279
00:17:33.496 --> 00:17:35.063
Help with what exactly?

280
00:17:35.098 --> 00:17:37.266
You'll receive
your inheritance


281
00:17:37.300 --> 00:17:39.701
if and only if you meet
all the stipulations


282
00:17:39.769 --> 00:17:41.503
outlined in this contract

283
00:17:41.537 --> 00:17:45.641
during a mandated one-year
residency at Anderson house


284
00:17:45.675 --> 00:17:48.176
overseen by Mr. Stevens.

285
00:17:48.211 --> 00:17:50.979
Here. For a year.

286
00:17:51.014 --> 00:17:52.414
Miss Sally was hoping

287
00:17:52.482 --> 00:17:55.684
you'd embrace
the Anderson house legacy.


288
00:17:55.718 --> 00:17:58.687
Right.

289
00:17:58.721 --> 00:18:01.390
Three weeks ago
I had $5 million.


290
00:18:01.424 --> 00:18:03.025
What happened to it?

291
00:18:03.059 --> 00:18:04.993
When miss Sally passed,

292
00:18:05.061 --> 00:18:07.596
your funds reverted to the
Anderson house corporate trust


293
00:18:07.630 --> 00:18:11.800
represented by myself and
Mr. Stevens here, respectively.


294
00:18:11.834 --> 00:18:15.637
She did this
to force me back here.


295
00:18:15.672 --> 00:18:19.708
No one is forcing you.
You can always walk away.


296
00:18:19.776 --> 00:18:21.843
And if I do?

297
00:18:21.878 --> 00:18:23.512
Well, then...

298
00:18:23.546 --> 00:18:25.414
Miss Sally made provisions

299
00:18:25.481 --> 00:18:28.150
to ensure the continued success
of her work.


300
00:18:28.184 --> 00:18:30.919
What happens
at the end of the year


301
00:18:30.953 --> 00:18:34.523
if I still want nothing
to do with... this?


302
00:18:34.557 --> 00:18:37.025
Then all
Anderson house assets revert


303
00:18:37.060 --> 00:18:39.094
to an irrevocable
charitable trust.


304
00:18:39.128 --> 00:18:40.896
And I get nothing.

305
00:18:40.930 --> 00:18:43.632
You will receive a payout
of $5 million.


306
00:18:43.666 --> 00:18:46.268
What used to be my trust.

307
00:18:48.171 --> 00:18:50.639
If you want
your money, sign it.


308
00:18:50.673 --> 00:18:53.508
I want my freedom.

309
00:18:58.314 --> 00:18:59.881
Anyone have a pen?

310
00:19:12.962 --> 00:19:15.097
Listen, I know what
you're going through.


311
00:19:15.131 --> 00:19:16.264
No.<i>You</i> listen.

312
00:19:16.299 --> 00:19:17.599
You don't know me!

313
00:19:17.633 --> 00:19:19.801
I signed that contract
to buy my escape!


314
00:19:19.836 --> 00:19:22.170
Once I'm done, I'm out.
Got it?


315
00:19:22.205 --> 00:19:25.374
Breakfast is at 7:00.

316
00:19:34.183 --> 00:19:36.017
So, let's say
after a year,


317
00:19:36.085 --> 00:19:38.687
I want to sell Anderson house
and be done with it.


318
00:19:38.721 --> 00:19:41.456
Hmm? Then what?

319
00:19:41.491 --> 00:19:44.359
I have first right
of refusal


320
00:19:44.394 --> 00:19:47.696
at a predetermined price.

321
00:19:47.730 --> 00:19:49.664
Who are you?

322
00:19:49.699 --> 00:19:53.402
What are you doing here,
and how much?


323
00:19:53.436 --> 00:19:55.203
Gus Caldwell.

324
00:19:55.238 --> 00:19:59.474
You're about to find out.
One dollar.


325
00:20:01.577 --> 00:20:04.613
Any other questions?

326
00:20:07.316 --> 00:20:08.984
Not at the moment.

327
00:20:09.018 --> 00:20:13.722
Hey, Mr. Stevens,
what's next on the agenda?


328
00:20:13.790 --> 00:20:15.824
The memorial garden.

329
00:20:15.858 --> 00:20:18.794
What memorial garden?

330
00:20:18.828 --> 00:20:21.663
The memorial garden
we're about to build


331
00:20:21.697 --> 00:20:25.100
in the honor of miss Sally.

332
00:20:29.605 --> 00:20:32.140
Well, this could be
interesting.


333
00:20:32.175 --> 00:20:34.176
You know what this
reminds me of, don't ya?


334
00:20:34.210 --> 00:20:35.811
Oh, please, please don't.

335
00:20:35.845 --> 00:20:37.846
Gus:

336
00:20:49.659 --> 00:20:52.027
All right,
the walkway up the slope


337
00:20:52.094 --> 00:20:53.728
will end right about here.

338
00:20:53.796 --> 00:20:57.132
This area will be surrounded
by a wrought-iron fence.


339
00:20:57.166 --> 00:21:00.469
They'll be benches here
so people can enjoy the view.


340
00:21:00.503 --> 00:21:02.070
Do you guys have a plan,

341
00:21:02.104 --> 00:21:05.240
or are you just making
this up as you go along?


342
00:21:05.274 --> 00:21:07.576
Plans are in the truck.

343
00:21:07.610 --> 00:21:09.911
Do you mind?

344
00:21:09.946 --> 00:21:12.214
No, go right ahead.

345
00:21:20.656 --> 00:21:22.491
We're burning daylight!

346
00:21:22.525 --> 00:21:24.326
It's not right.

347
00:21:24.360 --> 00:21:25.760
Why not?

348
00:21:25.795 --> 00:21:27.729
These plans were drawn up

349
00:21:27.797 --> 00:21:30.298
by the best landscape
architect in Texas!


350
00:21:30.333 --> 00:21:33.001
Did he physically
inspect the site?


351
00:21:34.537 --> 00:21:36.838
Never mind.

352
00:21:39.242 --> 00:21:41.009
What do you mean
"never mind"?


353
00:21:41.043 --> 00:21:43.712
Don't walk away like that!
Come back here and talk to us!


354
00:21:43.746 --> 00:21:45.213
Gus, Gus,
just give us a bit, all right?


355
00:21:45.248 --> 00:21:47.449
Will you, Gus?

356
00:21:47.483 --> 00:21:50.118
What's the problem, Joey?

357
00:21:50.152 --> 00:21:52.454
In general,
or specifically?


358
00:21:52.488 --> 00:21:54.189
Either. Both.

359
00:21:54.257 --> 00:21:56.625
Okay, well, I know
there's still something


360
00:21:56.659 --> 00:21:57.826
you're not telling me.

361
00:21:57.860 --> 00:21:59.528
I mean,
I've signed the contract.


362
00:21:59.595 --> 00:22:00.862
I'm here for the next year.

363
00:22:00.897 --> 00:22:04.399
But there's more
to this, right?


364
00:22:04.467 --> 00:22:07.235
All right, look.
I'll make you a deal.


365
00:22:07.303 --> 00:22:09.404
You tell me what's wrong
with the plans,


366
00:22:09.438 --> 00:22:11.506
and I'll answer some
of your questions.


367
00:22:11.541 --> 00:22:13.108
Deal.

368
00:22:16.946 --> 00:22:20.115
Oh, it's
getting warm out here.


369
00:22:20.149 --> 00:22:22.951
Maybe I should bring them
some refreshments.


370
00:22:22.985 --> 00:22:24.119
Oh, I can do that.

371
00:22:24.153 --> 00:22:25.854
Mm-hmm

372
00:22:25.922 --> 00:22:27.422
what?

373
00:22:27.456 --> 00:22:29.524
I'm just doing
my due diligence.


374
00:22:29.592 --> 00:22:32.527
Give me a minute, and I'll put
a tray together for you.


375
00:22:32.595 --> 00:22:34.696
Here, let me help.

376
00:22:36.399 --> 00:22:38.333
All right, now look at this.

377
00:22:38.367 --> 00:22:40.001
What am I looking at?

378
00:22:40.036 --> 00:22:42.737
An English terrace garden
with tombstone here.


379
00:22:42.772 --> 00:22:44.673
You got rectangles
here and here,


380
00:22:44.707 --> 00:22:46.341
and triangles here and here,

381
00:22:46.375 --> 00:22:49.010
and right-angle tension
everywhere you look.


382
00:22:49.045 --> 00:22:51.279
Well,
what's wrong with that?


383
00:22:51.314 --> 00:22:54.583
Nothing if there's never
more than three inches of rain.


384
00:22:54.617 --> 00:22:56.051
Anything over that,

385
00:22:56.085 --> 00:22:58.219
and then there's nowhere
for the runoff to go.


386
00:22:58.254 --> 00:23:00.822
Well, a French drain
would fix that.


387
00:23:00.856 --> 00:23:04.292
What's wrong with rectangles?
The headstone is a rectangle.


388
00:23:04.327 --> 00:23:06.795
Well, it's not just
any rectangle.


389
00:23:06.829 --> 00:23:08.029
What is it?

390
00:23:08.064 --> 00:23:09.631
It's a golden ratio.

391
00:23:09.665 --> 00:23:11.866
Ah, 1:1.618.

392
00:23:13.135 --> 00:23:15.503
Physics 101.

393
00:23:15.538 --> 00:23:19.007
You ever see
Da Vinci's "last supper"?


394
00:23:19.041 --> 00:23:21.943
It's 15 feet, 1 inch
by 29 feet.


395
00:23:22.011 --> 00:23:24.613
That's a ratio of 1:1.618.

396
00:23:24.647 --> 00:23:26.815
Same ratio as the headstones.

397
00:23:26.882 --> 00:23:29.884
So miss Sally based
her design off of a painting?


398
00:23:29.919 --> 00:23:33.622
No, she designed it after
a universal mathematical law.


399
00:23:33.656 --> 00:23:34.856
Here, come look.

400
00:23:37.593 --> 00:23:40.528
Excuse me.

401
00:23:40.563 --> 00:23:42.397
All right,
what am I looking at?


402
00:23:42.465 --> 00:23:43.698
Closer next to me.

403
00:23:43.733 --> 00:23:47.402
Oh, I see it.

404
00:23:47.470 --> 00:23:50.205
See how that bubble's
pushed up against that side?


405
00:23:50.239 --> 00:23:52.040
Now what this.

406
00:23:53.109 --> 00:23:57.379
As it now, water flows
around the gravesite.


407
00:23:57.413 --> 00:23:58.780
She set it up that way.

408
00:23:58.814 --> 00:24:00.949
Any more than ten inches
of rain,


409
00:24:00.983 --> 00:24:03.818
and Gus' garden is going
right into that pond.


410
00:24:05.821 --> 00:24:08.690
Well,
what do you suggest?


411
00:24:08.758 --> 00:24:11.526
I'm thinking
a Japanese-inspired design


412
00:24:11.594 --> 00:24:13.294
based off the golden ratio.

413
00:24:19.035 --> 00:24:20.735
Come here.

414
00:24:22.738 --> 00:24:24.739
Stand right here.

415
00:24:24.774 --> 00:24:26.174
Hold that.

416
00:24:26.208 --> 00:24:28.109
Thank you.

417
00:24:36.719 --> 00:24:39.521
15.1.

418
00:24:41.023 --> 00:24:44.025
15.1.

419
00:24:44.093 --> 00:24:45.026
Excuse me.

420
00:24:45.094 --> 00:24:47.195
Thank you.

421
00:24:47.229 --> 00:24:49.798
15.1.

422
00:24:49.832 --> 00:24:52.000
15.1.

423
00:24:52.034 --> 00:24:55.837
Do you think
that's an accident?


424
00:24:55.871 --> 00:24:57.739
Where did you learn this?

425
00:24:57.773 --> 00:25:00.008
Did you ever hear
of the Internet?


426
00:25:00.042 --> 00:25:03.445
Jason:

427
00:25:03.512 --> 00:25:06.648
Can you pull this off?

428
00:25:06.716 --> 00:25:08.116
Look, we have a deal.

429
00:25:08.150 --> 00:25:09.951
I explained why Gus' plan
won't work,


430
00:25:09.985 --> 00:25:11.419
and I showed you one that will.

431
00:25:11.454 --> 00:25:12.821
Mm.

432
00:25:12.855 --> 00:25:15.490
Makes total sense to me.

433
00:25:15.524 --> 00:25:18.159
Now, if you two will excuse me.

434
00:25:18.194 --> 00:25:21.629
Mr. Stevens. Mr. Anderson.

435
00:25:21.664 --> 00:25:23.732
Miss James.

436
00:25:27.570 --> 00:25:29.003
Now, I want to know the truth

437
00:25:29.038 --> 00:25:30.905
about what's going on
around here.


438
00:25:34.343 --> 00:25:36.344
Can I buy you lunch?

439
00:25:36.378 --> 00:25:38.480
Yeah. Let's go.

440
00:25:49.425 --> 00:25:51.292
You gents know
what you want?


441
00:25:51.327 --> 00:25:53.194
Two of whatever
he's having.


442
00:25:53.262 --> 00:25:55.363
Uh, two burgers.

443
00:25:55.397 --> 00:25:57.365
No onions. No onions?

444
00:25:57.399 --> 00:26:00.735
Uh, a couple of root beers.

445
00:26:00.803 --> 00:26:03.538
You promised me
information.


446
00:26:03.572 --> 00:26:08.343
The will details a series
of steps you have to take...


447
00:26:08.377 --> 00:26:09.611
Steps?

448
00:26:09.678 --> 00:26:11.946
Yeah.

449
00:26:11.981 --> 00:26:13.982
Thank you.

450
00:26:14.049 --> 00:26:16.985
Look, when my grandfather died,

451
00:26:17.052 --> 00:26:20.421
he left behind a series
of messages for me.


452
00:26:20.456 --> 00:26:24.125
He called them gifts,
leading up to the ultimate gift.


453
00:26:24.160 --> 00:26:26.995
Now, I had a number
of tasks to complete


454
00:26:27.029 --> 00:26:29.664
before I received
my inheritance.


455
00:26:29.698 --> 00:26:33.301
He wanted to ensure whoever
took over the estate


456
00:26:33.335 --> 00:26:35.069
understood and respected it.

457
00:26:35.137 --> 00:26:38.907
And he picked you.

458
00:26:38.941 --> 00:26:40.875
Look, he gave me a chance.

459
00:26:40.910 --> 00:26:43.211
The Stevens foundation
is now funded


460
00:26:43.245 --> 00:26:45.213
by the estate of red Stevens.

461
00:26:45.247 --> 00:26:47.248
And you're the c.E.O.

462
00:26:48.717 --> 00:26:51.052
And your grandfather
laid these steps.


463
00:26:51.086 --> 00:26:53.521
Not steps. Gifts.

464
00:26:53.589 --> 00:26:55.990
Right, right,
of course... gifts.


465
00:26:58.594 --> 00:27:00.829
Uh, Kim, do you have
a pen I could borrow?


466
00:27:00.863 --> 00:27:02.730
Mm-hmm.

467
00:27:02.798 --> 00:27:04.332
Thank you.

468
00:27:05.801 --> 00:27:07.335
Name 'em.

469
00:27:07.369 --> 00:27:08.803
Well, the first
is the gift of work...


470
00:27:08.838 --> 00:27:11.439
Briefly, please.

471
00:27:11.507 --> 00:27:16.211
Work, money, friends,

472
00:27:16.245 --> 00:27:19.047
learning, problems, family,

473
00:27:19.081 --> 00:27:22.617
laughter, dreams, giving,

474
00:27:22.651 --> 00:27:26.020
gratitude, a day, and love.

475
00:27:26.088 --> 00:27:29.190
Sounds like loyal, brave,
reverent, trustworthy,


476
00:27:29.258 --> 00:27:32.093
friendly, clean,
courteous, kind,


477
00:27:32.127 --> 00:27:35.163
helpful, cheerful, and honor.

478
00:27:35.197 --> 00:27:36.998
You a scout?

479
00:27:38.634 --> 00:27:42.136
So, I literally have to
complete the 12-step program?


480
00:27:42.171 --> 00:27:45.340
Look, we're all trying
to fulfill miss Sally's wish


481
00:27:45.374 --> 00:27:47.876
to protect the legacy
of the Anderson house.


482
00:27:47.910 --> 00:27:49.210
Legacy?

483
00:27:52.314 --> 00:27:54.449
What does that word mean
to you?


484
00:27:54.483 --> 00:28:00.255
I'm an only child,
and now they're all dead.


485
00:28:00.289 --> 00:28:04.626
I'm happy to let the Anderson
house legacy die with them.


486
00:28:06.195 --> 00:28:08.730
Is there something wrong
with your burgers?


487
00:28:08.797 --> 00:28:10.164
Not at all,

488
00:28:10.199 --> 00:28:11.966
but would you mind
boxing them up for us?


489
00:28:12.001 --> 00:28:13.735
Sure thing.

490
00:28:13.802 --> 00:28:16.070
Thank you.

491
00:28:20.242 --> 00:28:24.279
I think you and I got off
on the wrong foot.


492
00:28:24.313 --> 00:28:26.414
I want the original copy
of the will.


493
00:28:26.448 --> 00:28:27.916
You already have it.

494
00:28:27.950 --> 00:28:29.784
No, I'm talking
about the notebook.


495
00:28:29.818 --> 00:28:31.085
What notebook?

496
00:28:31.120 --> 00:28:32.620
Joey:

497
00:28:32.655 --> 00:28:35.623
Miss Sally
never used computers.


498
00:28:35.658 --> 00:28:38.459
And I seriously doubt
that she dictated


499
00:28:38.494 --> 00:28:40.094
300 pages of legalese.

500
00:28:40.129 --> 00:28:43.164
There's a notebook,
and I want it.


501
00:28:43.198 --> 00:28:45.199
All right.

502
00:28:52.341 --> 00:28:56.611
Yes, Mr. Anderson is requesting

503
00:28:56.679 --> 00:28:58.546
miss Sally's original copy
of the will.


504
00:28:58.580 --> 00:29:01.149
He believes it's in
a handwritten notebook.


505
00:29:01.216 --> 00:29:04.719
Oh, really?

506
00:29:04.753 --> 00:29:06.854
Well, we'll swing by
and pick it up.


507
00:29:06.922 --> 00:29:09.357
Thanks.

508
00:29:09.425 --> 00:29:11.659
Let's go.

509
00:29:11.694 --> 00:29:13.428
Great.

510
00:29:31.780 --> 00:29:35.116
You guys, uh, you hungry?

511
00:29:37.720 --> 00:29:39.420
Thank you.

512
00:29:39.455 --> 00:29:40.521
Of course.

513
00:29:40.589 --> 00:29:42.957
Enjoy.

514
00:29:42.992 --> 00:29:46.527
And by the way,
how much did you inherit?


515
00:29:46.595 --> 00:29:49.731
$100 million.

516
00:29:49.798 --> 00:29:51.899
Joey:

517
00:29:54.403 --> 00:29:56.004
What did you do with it?

518
00:29:56.038 --> 00:29:58.406
I gave it away.

519
00:29:58.440 --> 00:29:59.707
All of it?

520
00:29:59.742 --> 00:30:01.109
All of it.

521
00:30:01.176 --> 00:30:03.711
Well, in that case,
thanks for lunch.


522
00:30:15.791 --> 00:30:18.760
Why didn't you mention this
before I signed the contract?


523
00:30:18.794 --> 00:30:20.094
It contains a clause

524
00:30:20.129 --> 00:30:21.896
that states any heir who...

525
00:30:21.930 --> 00:30:23.798
Who contests the will is
automatically disinherited.


526
00:30:23.832 --> 00:30:24.999
Why didn't you mention this?

527
00:30:25.034 --> 00:30:26.601
It wasn't a stipulation.

528
00:30:42.451 --> 00:30:44.786
Something on your mind?

529
00:30:47.689 --> 00:30:49.924
What I can't quite
figure out


530
00:30:49.958 --> 00:30:52.093
is the connection
between my grandmother


531
00:30:52.127 --> 00:30:53.628
and red Stevens.

532
00:30:54.630 --> 00:30:57.932
I mean, something had to be
going on between those two


533
00:30:57.966 --> 00:30:59.667
for them to be so close.

534
00:30:59.701 --> 00:31:01.369
You think?

535
00:31:01.437 --> 00:31:04.005
I mean, why else would she
impose the same rules on me


536
00:31:04.039 --> 00:31:08.843
that your grandfather imposed
on you?


537
00:31:08.877 --> 00:31:12.380
Maybe they had a thing
for each other.


538
00:31:14.283 --> 00:31:16.184
What are you implying?

539
00:31:16.218 --> 00:31:19.220
They must have been very,

540
00:31:19.254 --> 00:31:22.123
very close.

541
00:31:22.157 --> 00:31:25.927
But probably closer
behind closed doors.


542
00:31:31.700 --> 00:31:34.001
What, are we walking
the rest of way?


543
00:31:36.505 --> 00:31:40.875
Those two people were
God's gift to the world!


544
00:31:40.909 --> 00:31:43.044
They did more than you could
ever hope to do.


545
00:31:43.078 --> 00:31:45.580
Hey, hey, hey. Relax.

546
00:31:45.647 --> 00:31:48.416
It's all good.

547
00:31:48.450 --> 00:31:50.251
You got yours.
I get that.


548
00:31:50.285 --> 00:31:52.086
I'm just trying to get mine.

549
00:31:55.991 --> 00:31:58.593
You said you understood what
I was going through, right?


550
00:31:58.627 --> 00:32:00.261
I didn't make that up!

551
00:32:03.799 --> 00:32:07.468
You feel that, right there?

552
00:32:07.503 --> 00:32:09.504
I can feel it.

553
00:32:09.538 --> 00:32:12.340
Heart racing, temples bounding,

554
00:32:12.374 --> 00:32:13.708
blood coursing through
your veins


555
00:32:13.742 --> 00:32:15.376
so you feel like
you're about to explode.


556
00:32:15.410 --> 00:32:16.644
You feel that?!

557
00:32:21.350 --> 00:32:23.851
Are you done?

558
00:32:27.556 --> 00:32:30.424
Try to imagine living
with that every day


559
00:32:30.459 --> 00:32:33.461
while everyone who is supposed
to love you


560
00:32:33.495 --> 00:32:36.230
wanders from one party
to the next...


561
00:32:36.265 --> 00:32:38.166
And you might have
a shadow of a clue


562
00:32:38.200 --> 00:32:41.035
of what I'm going through

563
00:32:41.103 --> 00:32:43.938
and why I don't trust you...

564
00:32:43.972 --> 00:32:46.340
Or anybody else.

565
00:33:14.803 --> 00:33:19.473
You know, I'm thinking
if I complete this


566
00:33:19.508 --> 00:33:22.210
12-step program
before the year's up,


567
00:33:22.244 --> 00:33:24.579
can I leave early?

568
00:33:24.646 --> 00:33:27.448
Let's just take it
a day at a time.


569
00:33:29.251 --> 00:33:32.086
Oh. Here.

570
00:33:34.256 --> 00:33:39.060
It's for the
memorial garden... only.


571
00:33:39.094 --> 00:33:41.996
Don't get any bright ideas.

572
00:33:42.064 --> 00:33:46.367
I'm full of bright
ideas, Mr. Stevens.


573
00:33:48.804 --> 00:33:51.806
Excuse me? Uh, excuse me.

574
00:33:51.840 --> 00:33:53.407
I already had these on hold.

575
00:33:53.442 --> 00:33:56.110
You see the little red tags
right here? They're...


576
00:33:56.178 --> 00:33:58.079
Kelly?

577
00:33:58.113 --> 00:34:01.649
I, uh, didn't
fancy you a green thumb.


578
00:34:01.717 --> 00:34:04.318
Oh, but you do fancy
me, then, huh?


579
00:34:04.386 --> 00:34:06.220
Ha ha.

580
00:34:06.255 --> 00:34:09.056
So, are you looking
to buy those?


581
00:34:09.091 --> 00:34:11.025
Why, do you want 'em?

582
00:34:11.093 --> 00:34:12.326
What, the trees?

583
00:34:12.361 --> 00:34:14.996
What else?

584
00:34:15.030 --> 00:34:19.133
You don't like me,
do you, Kelly?


585
00:34:19.167 --> 00:34:21.836
Or should I say, miss James?

586
00:34:21.870 --> 00:34:24.572
Do you care, Mr. Anderson?

587
00:34:26.241 --> 00:34:27.675
You gonna buy those
or not?


588
00:34:27.709 --> 00:34:29.210
Kelly:

589
00:34:29.244 --> 00:34:32.580
Are we only communicating
in questions now or...?


590
00:34:32.614 --> 00:34:35.616
You're different
off the clock.


591
00:34:35.651 --> 00:34:37.652
Oh? Most people are.

592
00:34:37.719 --> 00:34:39.987
Mr. world traveler.

593
00:34:40.055 --> 00:34:42.123
Oh! That was good.

594
00:34:43.692 --> 00:34:45.026
Ah, all right.

595
00:34:45.093 --> 00:34:46.594
How about you take that one,

596
00:34:46.628 --> 00:34:48.763
and I'll get the other one?

597
00:34:48.797 --> 00:34:51.465
Oh, I get it.
You want the big one.


598
00:34:51.500 --> 00:34:53.567
Yeah. Is that all right
with you?


599
00:34:53.635 --> 00:34:54.869
Oh, no, that's fine.

600
00:34:54.903 --> 00:34:57.705
I prefer the small feisty ones.

601
00:35:04.813 --> 00:35:06.781
There you go.

602
00:35:06.815 --> 00:35:10.418
Wait, there is one
Japanese maple too many here.


603
00:35:10.452 --> 00:35:12.086
No, no, no.

604
00:35:12.120 --> 00:35:14.655
Well, okay, these are the ones
that you ordered, uh?


605
00:35:14.690 --> 00:35:17.458
And that one there,
that one's a gift.


606
00:35:17.492 --> 00:35:19.193
A gift, huh?

607
00:35:19.261 --> 00:35:20.795
Mm-hmm.

608
00:35:25.033 --> 00:35:27.468
Well, that's very nice.
Thank you.

dragged me back here for a year.


727
00:40:37.112 --> 00:40:40.547
So, I did some digging.

728
00:40:45.153 --> 00:40:48.389
Well, she must have
had her reasons.


729
00:40:48.423 --> 00:40:50.658
How old were you
when your dad died?


730
00:40:53.628 --> 00:40:56.130
Not old enough.

731
00:40:59.100 --> 00:41:01.769
Did you two have
a good relationship?


732
00:41:03.004 --> 00:41:04.805
He loved me and my mom.

733
00:41:04.839 --> 00:41:09.677
We, uh...

734
00:41:09.711 --> 00:41:14.181
We moved back here
when my mom got sick,


735
00:41:14.215 --> 00:41:19.420
and when she died
everything changed.


736
00:41:19.487 --> 00:41:22.823
He started drinking.

737
00:41:22.857 --> 00:41:26.560
Couldn't stand it.

738
00:41:28.563 --> 00:41:30.297
Couldn't stand what?

739
00:41:32.734 --> 00:41:34.301
He couldn't stand that

740
00:41:34.369 --> 00:41:36.737
even though he had all the money
in the world


741
00:41:36.771 --> 00:41:39.673
he couldn't save my mother.

742
00:41:39.741 --> 00:41:43.210
So, uh, he put a bullet
through his head.


743
00:41:47.982 --> 00:41:49.450
I'm sorry.

744
00:41:49.484 --> 00:41:52.319
That is not gonna
happen to me.


745
00:42:00.295 --> 00:42:04.865
The gift of money
is next, right?


746
00:42:04.899 --> 00:42:06.967

781
00:44:15.697 --> 00:44:17.965
He offered a free weekend

782
00:44:18.032 --> 00:44:19.366
to the families of the men

783
00:44:19.400 --> 00:44:21.368
who provided labor
and materials.


784
00:44:21.402 --> 00:44:24.471
But I saw him
at the garden center.


785
00:44:24.505 --> 00:44:26.273

786
00:44:26.307 --> 00:44:30.010
No, but I bought a plant.

787
00:44:30.044 --> 00:44:32.846

Hmm. Interesting.

797

800
00:45:22.664 --> 00:45:25.799
I did.
Thank you, Mr. Anderson.


801
00:45:25.833 --> 00:45:28.568
Well, waking up
is more important


802
00:45:28.636 --> 00:45:30.037
than going to sleep.

803
00:45:30.071 --> 00:45:32.539
I think
they're both important.

00:46:04.472 --> 00:46:06.039
This is my friend Max.

819
00:46:06.074 --> 00:46:08.075
Nice to meet you.

820
00:46:08.109 --> 00:46:11.078
Joey, these men
are here at my request.


821
00:46:11.112 --> 00:46:13.246
Mr. Forbes knows
a lot about money,


822
00:46:13.281 --> 00:46:16.383
which is today's undertaking,
as you know.


823
00:46:16.417 --> 00:46:18.251
All we ask is that
you hear them out.


824
00:46:18.286 --> 00:46:19.820
Chloe:

825
00:46:19.887 --> 00:46:21.121
And on that note,

826
00:46:21.155 --> 00:46:23.290
we'll catch up with you guys
in a bit.


827
00:46:23.324 --> 00:46:24.825
All right, honey.

828
00:46:24.859 --> 00:46:26.593
Hey, there's
a whole bookshelf


829
00:46:26.627 --> 00:46:28.261
of my old books
in the library.


830
00:46:28.296 --> 00:46:30.530
You know what happens when
you give a mouse a cookie?


831
00:46:30.598 --> 00:46:32.532
Library, daddy!

832
00:46:32.567 --> 00:46:34.568
Okay. Okay, we'll go.

833
00:46:34.635 --> 00:46:36.403
Are you ready? Ugh.

834
00:46:36.471 --> 00:46:39.639
What happens when you
give a mouse a cookie?


835
00:46:41.376 --> 00:46:43.110
Sorry, please, continue.

836
00:46:43.177 --> 00:46:45.912
I toured non-stop
after my first hit record.


837
00:46:45.947 --> 00:46:47.914
My manager,
fearing I'd burn out,


838
00:46:47.949 --> 00:46:50.384
insisted I spend a week
at Anderson house.


839
00:46:50.418 --> 00:46:51.718
I met Steve right here.

840
00:46:51.753 --> 00:46:53.387
We sat across from each other,

841
00:46:53.421 --> 00:46:55.622
and miss Sally sat
right where you are.


842
00:46:55.656 --> 00:46:58.759
Miss Sally worried you
had a warped view of money.


843
00:46:58.793 --> 00:47:01.762
It costs money
to stay gone.


844
00:47:01.796 --> 00:47:03.163
That's my view.

845
00:47:03.197 --> 00:47:04.364
Can you say the money

846
00:47:04.432 --> 00:47:05.832
bought you freedom
from this place?


847
00:47:05.867 --> 00:47:07.901
You're trying to prove
I have no concept


848
00:47:07.969 --> 00:47:09.569
or idea of how
the economy works.


849
00:47:09.637 --> 00:47:12.305
I'm here out of respect
for your grandmother.


850
00:47:12.340 --> 00:47:15.075
You don't want to convince
me of your world view first?


851
00:47:15.109 --> 00:47:17.010
Steve:

852
00:47:17.045 --> 00:47:20.514
Oh, it's obvious that
you are the only person


853
00:47:20.548 --> 00:47:23.784
who can convince Joey Anderson
of anything.


854
00:47:23.818 --> 00:47:25.986
Oh, this guy knows me.

855
00:47:26.054 --> 00:47:29.256
So what's this money thing
we're doing?


856
00:47:29.290 --> 00:47:30.824
I'd like to stage a concert

857
00:47:30.858 --> 00:47:32.759
here on the grounds
in your riding hall.


858
00:47:32.794 --> 00:47:35.495
To benefit
wish for our heroes,


859
00:47:35.530 --> 00:47:37.330
a program we both support.

860
00:47:37.365 --> 00:47:40.000
Uh

861
00:47:40.034 --> 00:47:42.369
in... in the hall?

862
00:47:42.403 --> 00:47:44.971
It's a great space.
Perfect for a show.


863
00:47:45.006 --> 00:47:47.741
We want you
to organize the event,


864
00:47:47.775 --> 00:47:49.376
collect the proceeds,

865
00:47:49.410 --> 00:47:52.679
and determine how best to
present it to the soldiers.


866
00:47:52.713 --> 00:47:55.449
Uh, I've never done
anything like this before.


867
00:47:55.516 --> 00:47:57.050
I wouldn't know where to start.

868
00:47:57.085 --> 00:48:00.087
My advice...

869
00:48:00.121 --> 00:48:03.590
Focus on the people
you're serving...


870
00:48:03.624 --> 00:48:06.259
And take it one step at a time.

871
00:48:06.294 --> 00:48:08.161
I'd like to
check out the venue.


872
00:48:08.196 --> 00:48:10.597
Come on, Joey.
Let's go for a walk.


873
00:48:10.631 --> 00:48:13.366
You want to go look
at it right now?


874
00:48:13.401 --> 00:48:15.068
Got to figure up
power, staging,


875
00:48:15.136 --> 00:48:17.003
how big an audience...
Is there a problem?


876
00:48:17.038 --> 00:48:18.371
No, no, no.

877
00:48:18.406 --> 00:48:26.480
Yeah, let's go. Let's do it.
Let's go.


878
00:48:26.482 --> 00:48:28.115
Wow.

879
00:48:31.886 --> 00:48:34.688
Come on, Joey!

880
00:48:37.225 --> 00:48:40.727
Wow, killer space.

881
00:48:40.761 --> 00:48:42.596
Definitely going to need
more power, though.


882
00:48:42.630 --> 00:48:44.498
I also want to figure out
stage sizing,


883
00:48:44.532 --> 00:48:46.967
which I think should be
right here.


884
00:48:47.001 --> 00:48:48.201
Don't you think?

885
00:48:48.269 --> 00:48:49.836
Yeah.

886
00:48:49.871 --> 00:48:52.005
Come on, Chloe.
Let's help Max count.


887
00:48:52.039 --> 00:48:53.507
He needs help.

888
00:48:53.541 --> 00:48:56.476
Here, get on those feet!

889
00:48:56.511 --> 00:49:00.680
One, two, three, four.

890
00:49:00.715 --> 00:49:02.115
Count loud.

891
00:49:02.183 --> 00:49:03.617
Five, six...

892
00:49:03.684 --> 00:49:05.018
Seven, eight, nine!

893
00:49:06.454 --> 00:49:10.290
Hey, uh, what's this?

894
00:49:10.324 --> 00:49:13.093
Hey, Chloe,
you want me to show you


895
00:49:13.127 --> 00:49:15.395
my favorite secret spot
in the whole house?


896
00:49:15.429 --> 00:49:16.663
Yes.

897
00:49:16.697 --> 00:49:19.933
Um, miss James can come.

898
00:49:19.967 --> 00:49:23.436
Miss James,
you want to come with us?


899
00:49:23.471 --> 00:49:25.539
Here, go grab her hand.

900
00:49:27.909 --> 00:49:29.976
Well, that explains it.

901
00:49:30.011 --> 00:49:31.478
What?

902
00:49:31.512 --> 00:49:33.146
Joey's reluctance.

903
00:49:33.181 --> 00:49:35.348
That's a bullet hole,

904
00:49:35.383 --> 00:49:38.885
and with that hole comes a lot
of dark history and baggage.


905
00:49:41.522 --> 00:49:43.823
Come on under.
Here we go.


906
00:49:45.760 --> 00:49:49.129
Okay, so this is it.

907
00:49:49.163 --> 00:49:53.033
This is my very favorite secret
spot in the whole house.


908
00:49:53.100 --> 00:49:56.102
You see my initials?
Right there?


909
00:49:56.137 --> 00:50:00.240
J.A. What's that mean?

910
00:50:00.308 --> 00:50:01.908
Joey Anderson.

911
00:50:01.976 --> 00:50:03.510
Yeah, that's right.

912
00:50:03.544 --> 00:50:05.345
Joey Anderson.

913
00:50:05.379 --> 00:50:08.081
You want to put your initials
up there, too?


914
00:50:08.115 --> 00:50:12.352
Okay, you can go explore while
I carve your initials in there.


915
00:50:12.386 --> 00:50:16.223
All right, okay.

916
00:50:18.259 --> 00:50:20.460
Joey, what's this?

917
00:50:20.494 --> 00:50:21.928
What's what?

918
00:50:25.333 --> 00:50:27.834
What is that?

919
00:50:45.353 --> 00:50:47.387
I think someone's coming.

920
00:50:47.421 --> 00:50:49.756
Oh, let's get out!

921
00:50:49.790 --> 00:50:51.825
Come on. It's our secret spot!

922
00:50:54.795 --> 00:50:56.997
Quick, quick, quick, Chloe.
Push it in. Push it in.


923
00:50:57.031 --> 00:50:59.299
Hey, chlo.
Whatcha doing?


924
00:50:59.333 --> 00:51:01.101
Come here.
Come here, honey.


925
00:51:01.135 --> 00:51:02.702
Yeah, that's my girl.

926
00:51:02.770 --> 00:51:05.672
Why don't you go see what
Claudia has in the kitchen


927
00:51:05.706 --> 00:51:07.040
for ya, okay? Go ahead.

928
00:51:08.676 --> 00:51:11.511
And not too many cookies, okay?

929
00:51:18.052 --> 00:51:20.954
You saw it, huh?

930
00:51:21.022 --> 00:51:23.456
Joey, I...

931
00:51:23.491 --> 00:51:26.760
- Uh, I'll...
- No, hold on. Stay.


932
00:51:26.794 --> 00:51:29.129
You should hear this, too.

933
00:51:31.265 --> 00:51:36.803
My dad left the bullet hole in
the hall when he offed himself.


934
00:51:38.472 --> 00:51:40.240
Some legacy, huh?

935
00:51:40.308 --> 00:51:46.513
And you guys want me to throw
a feel-good concert there.


936
00:51:46.547 --> 00:51:50.183
Was that the gift of irony?

937
00:51:50.217 --> 00:51:53.453
I know what it's like
to lose someone you love.


938
00:51:53.521 --> 00:51:57.123
Alexia's daughter, Emily, died.

939
00:51:57.158 --> 00:52:00.927
I miss her, every day.

940
00:52:02.763 --> 00:52:07.000
That bullet hole
is part of your history.


941
00:52:07.034 --> 00:52:10.704
You are a composite of
miss Sally and your father


942
00:52:10.771 --> 00:52:13.673
and all the Andersons.

943
00:52:13.708 --> 00:52:16.509
Only you get to decide
what to do with that.


944
00:52:16.544 --> 00:52:21.614
Well, it's late.
I got to get chlo home.


945
00:52:21.682 --> 00:52:26.219
You call me if you need
anything, okay?


946
00:52:29.590 --> 00:52:32.625
Joey, I...

947
00:52:32.660 --> 00:52:35.295
I'm so sorry.

948
00:52:37.932 --> 00:52:40.934
How can I help?

949
00:52:44.038 --> 00:52:46.473
You can't.

950
00:52:46.507 --> 00:52:48.141
What could you do?

951
00:52:59.120 --> 00:53:00.787
What is she doing here?

952
00:53:00.855 --> 00:53:02.789
This is her idea.

953
00:53:02.823 --> 00:53:05.091
Where are we going?

954
00:53:05.126 --> 00:53:06.459
You'll find out.

955
00:53:19.173 --> 00:53:20.340
Hi.

956
00:53:20.374 --> 00:53:23.176
Hey, ange.

957
00:53:23.210 --> 00:53:25.178
Michael, this is Joey.

958
00:53:25.212 --> 00:53:28.181
He is heading up the wish
for our heroes concert.


959
00:53:28.215 --> 00:53:29.949
And Joey, this is Michael.

960
00:53:30.017 --> 00:53:33.086
He's one of the beneficiaries
of the program.


961
00:53:33.120 --> 00:53:34.921
Hey. Great to meet you.

962
00:53:34.955 --> 00:53:36.656
Nice to meet you.

963
00:53:36.724 --> 00:53:40.293
And I'm sure
you recognize this guy.


964
00:53:40.327 --> 00:53:41.561
How's it going, buddy?

965
00:53:41.595 --> 00:53:42.829
Hey, how you doing, mate?

966
00:53:42.897 --> 00:53:44.130
Good to see you.

967
00:53:44.165 --> 00:53:45.432
Courage, honor, duty.

968
00:53:45.466 --> 00:53:47.033
Hey, he played for my platoon,

969
00:53:47.101 --> 00:53:49.436
and he was so inspired
that he wrote a song


970
00:53:49.470 --> 00:53:50.937
for us right then and there.

971
00:53:50.971 --> 00:53:54.140
Yeah, that got me through
some pretty tough times.


972
00:53:54.175 --> 00:53:57.844
So, how are you doing,
my brother?


973
00:53:57.878 --> 00:54:01.247
You know,
just doing the best I can.


974
00:54:01.282 --> 00:54:03.950
Trying to rebuild
my arm strength,


975
00:54:04.018 --> 00:54:05.852
and waiting...

976
00:54:05.886 --> 00:54:08.254
Just waiting to heal like
the rest of these guys.


977
00:54:08.289 --> 00:54:10.423
Well, that's what
this concert's all about.


978
00:54:10.458 --> 00:54:12.926
Raising money.
Getting you guys what you need.


979
00:54:12.960 --> 00:54:15.428
Yeah, I'd just like

980
00:54:15.463 --> 00:54:18.264
to dance with my wife again.

981
00:54:22.136 --> 00:54:23.837
Hey, Michael.

982
00:54:23.871 --> 00:54:25.905
Yeah.

983
00:54:25.973 --> 00:54:28.141
Um, can I see your hands?

984
00:54:28.175 --> 00:54:29.476
I just wanna...

985
00:54:29.510 --> 00:54:30.844
He's a rock climber...

986
00:54:30.878 --> 00:54:32.212
With a head to match.

987
00:54:32.246 --> 00:54:33.847
I'm not trying to mess
with you.


988
00:54:33.881 --> 00:54:35.415
You said you've been working
on your arm strength.


989
00:54:35.449 --> 00:54:37.383
I just want to give you a little
isometric strength test,


990
00:54:37.418 --> 00:54:38.685
- all right?
- All right.


991
00:54:38.719 --> 00:54:40.220
So, just make a claw.

992
00:54:40.254 --> 00:54:41.454
Yeah, like that.

993
00:54:41.522 --> 00:54:43.756
Now, resist what I'm doing
to ya.


994
00:54:43.791 --> 00:54:47.126
That's really good. Push up.

995
00:54:47.161 --> 00:54:49.662
Same with the other hand.
Claw, resist.


996
00:54:49.730 --> 00:54:52.365
Mm-hmm.
- And again.


997
00:54:52.433 --> 00:54:54.701
Yeah, whatever you're doing
for your arms is working.


998
00:54:54.768 --> 00:54:56.769
He's a pretty weird
kid, isn't he?


999
00:54:59.073 --> 00:55:01.174
Hey, uh, do you mind
if I try something with you?


1000
00:55:01.208 --> 00:55:02.675
I just wanna...

1001
00:55:02.710 --> 00:55:05.345
Yeah, all I got is time.

1002
00:55:05.379 --> 00:55:08.214
Now, your arm strength
seems pretty good to me,


1003
00:55:08.249 --> 00:55:11.117
but we want to get you
out of this chair, right?


1004
00:55:11.185 --> 00:55:12.785
Right.

1005
00:55:12.853 --> 00:55:14.721
I'm going
to lock this up,


1006
00:55:14.755 --> 00:55:16.756
and we're going to use this.

1007
00:55:16.790 --> 00:55:20.326
The goal is to pull your elbows
back into your ribs.


1008
00:55:20.394 --> 00:55:22.629
Yeah, but what if
I pull myself out


1009
00:55:22.663 --> 00:55:23.796
and fall in the floor?

1010
00:55:23.831 --> 00:55:25.098
You'll figure it out.

1011
00:55:25.132 --> 00:55:26.833
Just a do a little bit
at a time.


1012
00:55:26.867 --> 00:55:28.301
Just reach up.

1013
00:55:28.335 --> 00:55:30.103
Lift your butt out of the chair,

1014
00:55:30.137 --> 00:55:31.638
and then set it back down.

1015
00:55:35.910 --> 00:55:38.077
I got ya.

1016
00:55:38.145 --> 00:55:40.747
Yes, look at that.
Whoa! There you go.


1017
00:55:40.781 --> 00:55:42.515
That was pretty good, though.

1018
00:55:42.550 --> 00:55:47.620
Yeah. Yeah, it feels
good to move again, you know?


1019
00:55:47.688 --> 00:55:50.089
Yeah, I bet. Good job.

1020
00:55:50.124 --> 00:55:51.624
Thanks, man.

1021
00:55:51.659 --> 00:55:54.594
You will dance
with your wife again.


1022
00:55:59.500 --> 00:56:02.835
You know, maybe we've
been wrong about this guy.


1023
00:56:02.870 --> 00:56:07.040
Yeah,
he's pretty impressive.


1024
00:56:07.074 --> 00:56:11.578
I don't think he's
the jerk poppy thinks he is,


1025
00:56:11.645 --> 00:56:14.681
but we still gotta
make this thing legal.

a prosthetic leg cost?


1028

They start at around
ten grand each.

01:03:12.232 --> 01:03:15.534
Nah, I... I can't count
when I'm drinking, man.


1140
01:03:15.569 --> 01:03:18.037
You can't count when
you haven't been drinkin'.


1141
01:03:18.071 --> 01:03:20.239
Well, I haven't gotten
any of your donations yet.


1142
01:03:20.273 --> 01:03:22.742
Oh, all right.

1143
01:03:22.776 --> 01:03:24.243
Cough it up, guys.

1144
01:03:26.580 --> 01:03:28.681
Carry the two, all right.

1145
01:03:28.715 --> 01:03:31.217
There you go, Joe.
Four hundo each.


1146
01:03:31.284 --> 01:03:34.153
Wow, I really
appreciate this.


1147
01:03:34.187 --> 01:03:35.621
You know that, anytime.

1148
01:03:36.823 --> 01:03:38.324
Just a sec.

1149
01:03:38.358 --> 01:03:40.760
It's going to a good cause.

1150
01:03:40.827 --> 01:03:42.528
Yeah, no problem, man.

1151
01:03:42.562 --> 01:03:43.929
Hey, can you hold this
for a second?


1152
01:03:43.997 --> 01:03:46.298
Yeah?

1153
01:03:46.366 --> 01:03:48.534
I've got it all, yes.

1154
01:03:50.037 --> 01:03:52.271
The facts?
Okay, here are the facts.


1155
01:03:52.305 --> 01:03:54.774
He is an arrogant,
self-centered idiot,


1156
01:03:54.808 --> 01:03:56.308
and so are his friends.

1157
01:03:56.343 --> 01:03:59.078
I can't wait for this
whole thing to be over.


1158
01:03:59.112 --> 01:04:01.947
Yeah, well,
as far as I'm concerned,


1159
01:04:01.982 --> 01:04:04.850
if foster Colby sues us
we will take him down.


1160
01:04:04.885 --> 01:04:06.952
Have a good night.

1161
01:04:06.987 --> 01:04:07.987
You deserve it, man.

1162
01:04:08.021 --> 01:04:09.422
Thanks, man.

1163
01:04:09.489 --> 01:04:11.724
Good job.
Have a good night, guys.


1164
01:04:11.758 --> 01:04:13.359
Take care.

1165
01:04:13.393 --> 01:04:14.894
All right.

1166
01:04:14.928 --> 01:04:17.196
All right.
Here's to us.


1167
01:04:17.230 --> 01:04:20.566
We're friends indeed,
and if by chance we disagree,


1168
01:04:20.600 --> 01:04:22.301
forget you guys, here's to me.

1169
01:04:23.370 --> 01:04:24.437
Cheers.

1170
01:04:24.471 --> 01:04:26.338
Cheers.

1171
01:04:26.406 --> 01:04:28.774
Guys, I think it's
about that time, yeah?


1172
01:04:28.809 --> 01:04:30.676
Yeah, probably.

1173
01:04:30.744 --> 01:04:32.311
Am I going to see you guys
tomorrow at Anderson house?


1174
01:04:32.345 --> 01:04:33.979
Nah, can't do it.
We got to catch the red eye.


1175
01:04:34.014 --> 01:04:36.048
But you should hang with us.

1176
01:04:36.116 --> 01:04:37.283
Yeah.

1177
01:04:37.317 --> 01:04:38.784
I, uh...

1178
01:04:38.819 --> 01:04:40.786
This gig's got me tied up
for a little while.


1179
01:04:40.821 --> 01:04:42.455
We'll catch you
on the next one.


1180
01:04:42.489 --> 01:04:44.056
Yeah. I really appreciate
you guys coming out.


1181
01:04:44.091 --> 01:04:45.157
Yeah, no problem, man.

1182
01:04:45.192 --> 01:04:46.759
Be good.

1183
01:04:46.827 --> 01:04:49.895

1184
01:05:05.245 --> 01:05:07.446
Kelly:

1185
01:05:12.119 --> 01:05:13.853
Hey, pal. Hey.

1186
01:05:13.887 --> 01:05:15.888
Looks like you and your buddies
had a real nice reunion.


1187
01:05:15.922 --> 01:05:17.356
Yeah, they must be rich

1188
01:05:17.390 --> 01:05:19.391
judging from all that money
they gave you.


1189
01:05:22.395 --> 01:05:23.729
Joey:

1190
01:05:23.763 --> 01:05:24.797
Hand it over!

1191
01:05:24.865 --> 01:05:26.699
Not mine to give.

1192
01:05:28.368 --> 01:05:31.403
Flip him over.

1193
01:05:31.438 --> 01:05:32.771
It's in his pocket.
Flip him over!


1194
01:05:32.806 --> 01:05:34.073
No!

1195
01:05:37.277 --> 01:05:39.778
- Aah!
- You're a feisty one!


1196
01:05:39.813 --> 01:05:41.313
Good to see you.

1197
01:05:41.348 --> 01:05:42.615
Nice to be seen.

1198
01:05:45.218 --> 01:05:47.653
Joey:

1199
01:05:50.457 --> 01:05:52.158
Good morning, everyone.

1200
01:05:52.225 --> 01:05:53.792
Good morning.

1201
01:05:53.827 --> 01:05:56.495
I trust the evening
was a success.


1202
01:05:58.598 --> 01:05:59.832
Let me rephrase.

1203
01:05:59.866 --> 01:06:02.535
I trust the concert
was a success?


1204
01:06:02.602 --> 01:06:04.904
How does about 350k sound?

1205
01:06:04.971 --> 01:06:06.405
Wonderful.

1206
01:06:06.473 --> 01:06:08.040
I take it that figure includes

1207
01:06:08.074 --> 01:06:10.209
the donations from
your friends, Joey.


1208
01:06:10.243 --> 01:06:11.644
Right.

1209
01:06:17.951 --> 01:06:20.119
Kelly:

1210
01:06:20.153 --> 01:06:22.321
It does.

1211
01:06:22.389 --> 01:06:23.789
Oh, thank God!

1212
01:06:26.426 --> 01:06:29.795
Yeah, okay, yeah.

1213
01:06:29.829 --> 01:06:35.601
I'll admit my view of money
was very jaded,


1214
01:06:35.635 --> 01:06:39.338
or warped, to put it
in my grandmother's terms.


1215
01:06:40.574 --> 01:06:42.374
You know, it's funny.

1216
01:06:42.409 --> 01:06:44.843
Money's never meant as much
to me as it does right now


1217
01:06:44.878 --> 01:06:47.012
when I intend to give it away.

1218
01:06:49.950 --> 01:06:52.284
And, uh, miss James,

1219
01:06:52.352 --> 01:06:56.322
I'd like to apologize on behalf
of my friends and myself


1220
01:06:56.389 --> 01:06:59.892
for being arrogant,
self-centered idiots.


1221
01:06:59.926 --> 01:07:01.327
What are you talking about?

1222
01:07:01.394 --> 01:07:03.362
I overheard
your conversation, okay?


1223
01:07:03.430 --> 01:07:06.498
That phone call had
nothing to do with you.


1224
01:07:06.533 --> 01:07:08.500
Then, who were you
talking about?


1225
01:07:08.535 --> 01:07:10.836
It sure sounded like
you were talking about me.


1226
01:07:10.870 --> 01:07:13.072
No, I was talking about...

1227
01:07:13.139 --> 01:07:15.207
She can't tell you that.

1228
01:07:15.242 --> 01:07:17.343
It's called
attorney-client privilege.


1229
01:07:17.377 --> 01:07:19.912
Speaking of attorneys,

1230
01:07:19.946 --> 01:07:23.048
I'd like to address
the additional steps


1231
01:07:23.083 --> 01:07:25.417
laid out in miss Sally's will.

1232
01:07:25.452 --> 01:07:26.885
I'm listening.

1233
01:07:26.920 --> 01:07:28.420
Yeah, me too.

1234
01:07:28.455 --> 01:07:32.658
Well, Joey has proven
that he can work.


1235
01:07:32.726 --> 01:07:36.528
He has friends, and he can laugh
at his own mistakes.


1236
01:07:39.466 --> 01:07:41.433
Go on.

1237
01:07:41.468 --> 01:07:45.904
He's exceeded every
goal that we've set forth.


1238
01:07:45.972 --> 01:07:48.841
What are you getting at?

1239
01:07:48.875 --> 01:07:51.410
I think
you've proven yourself.


1240
01:07:51.478 --> 01:07:54.947
I think that we should bundle
the rest of the steps.


1241
01:07:55.015 --> 01:07:58.417
We can't have
any legal missteps,


1242
01:07:58.451 --> 01:07:59.852
but miss Sally made it clear

1243
01:07:59.886 --> 01:08:01.954
that she didn't want
to overly burden anyone.


1244
01:08:01.988 --> 01:08:03.122
Well, we're good, then.

1245
01:08:03.156 --> 01:08:04.790
Not quite.

1246
01:08:04.824 --> 01:08:07.593
The one non-negotiable

1247
01:08:07.627 --> 01:08:09.428
the year-long residency.

1248
01:08:09.462 --> 01:08:11.964
You've only been here
four months.


1249
01:08:11.998 --> 01:08:13.699
That leaves you plenty of time

1250
01:08:13.767 --> 01:08:16.001
for complete the last

1251
01:08:16.036 --> 01:08:19.538
learning, dreams,
gratitude, and love.


1252
01:08:22.542 --> 01:08:24.710
Is that true?

1253
01:08:24.744 --> 01:08:27.913
You weren't talking about me
last night?


1254
01:08:31.284 --> 01:08:36.789
You know, I have no problem
with being here a year.


1255
01:08:36.823 --> 01:08:41.393
Great.
Let's move on, shall we?


1256
01:08:41.428 --> 01:08:43.462
Joey, the learning stipulation

1257
01:08:43.496 --> 01:08:45.931
requires that you
not only learn,


1258
01:08:45.965 --> 01:08:48.033
but just as importantly, teach.

1259
01:08:48.101 --> 01:08:49.668
I've run into
Mr. Anderson in the...


1260
01:08:49.703 --> 01:08:52.237
Joey, buddy.

1261
01:08:52.305 --> 01:08:56.542
All right, I run
into Joey in the library,


1262
01:08:56.576 --> 01:08:59.578
and he's asked my opinion
on some of his selections.


1263
01:08:59.612 --> 01:09:01.447
Oscar has read them all.

1264
01:09:01.514 --> 01:09:03.682
I'm a reader.

1265
01:09:03.717 --> 01:09:07.152
So, Mr. Anderson... Joey...

1266
01:09:07.220 --> 01:09:09.088
That's going to take
some getting used to.


1267
01:09:09.122 --> 01:09:13.892
So, Joey, Joe
-Joe, Jo mama!

1268
01:09:16.162 --> 01:09:17.930
Too much.

1269
01:09:17.964 --> 01:09:20.299
So, Joey told me to
choose any book


1270
01:09:20.333 --> 01:09:21.934
and tell him its setting.

1271
01:09:21.968 --> 01:09:24.169
I chose Conrad's
"under Western eyes."


1272
01:09:24.204 --> 01:09:26.071
Set in St. Petersburg.

1273
01:09:26.139 --> 01:09:29.475
Yeah, and Joey
then proceeded to regale me


1274
01:09:29.509 --> 01:09:31.210
with tales of his travels

1275
01:09:31.244 --> 01:09:33.779
through everything
from run-down eating houses


1276
01:09:33.847 --> 01:09:35.848
to ornate gilded palaces,

1277
01:09:35.882 --> 01:09:37.950
and this is stuff that I'd
only read about.


1278
01:09:38.017 --> 01:09:39.885
I selected
"heart of darkness,"


1279
01:09:39.919 --> 01:09:42.454
and he recounted his time
in the Congo.


1280
01:09:42.489 --> 01:09:44.323
I love their drums.

1281
01:09:44.391 --> 01:09:46.925
Those are congas.

1282
01:09:46.960 --> 01:09:48.293
Jason:

1283
01:09:48.328 --> 01:09:50.095
Can we check learning
off the list?


1284
01:09:50.130 --> 01:09:52.197
That brings us to dreams.

1285
01:09:52.265 --> 01:09:54.600
Great.
That's convenient.


1286
01:09:57.137 --> 01:10:00.706
Because my dream...

1287
01:10:00.740 --> 01:10:05.377
Is to see a man
dance with his wife.


1288
01:10:05.412 --> 01:10:10.115
A man hold
his baby daughter.


1289
01:10:10.183 --> 01:10:14.486
See a family make
their mortgage payment.


1290
01:10:16.823 --> 01:10:19.057
This is more than we made.

1291
01:10:19.092 --> 01:10:23.295
Hawthorne:

1292
01:10:23.329 --> 01:10:25.264
If I may,

1293
01:10:25.298 --> 01:10:30.803
Mr. maximillian was kind enough
to make a donation of his own.


1294
01:10:35.809 --> 01:10:39.111
You know, my grammy g.,
to me,


1295
01:10:39.179 --> 01:10:42.614
was, uh, my only real family.

1296
01:10:42.682 --> 01:10:45.017
But, for good and bad,

1297

Are you guys ready to go?

1456
01:21:39.271 --> 01:21:42.040
Yeah, yeah, we're going
to go have some fun, aren't we?


1457
01:21:42.074 --> 01:21:44.109
Yes, we are! Yes, we are!

1458
01:21:44.143 --> 01:21:46.611
You better be ready
to have some fun.


1459
01:21:46.645 --> 01:21:48.746
All right, you ready to go?

1460
01:21:57.156 --> 01:21:58.323
How's it going?

1461
01:22:02.228 --> 01:22:04.062
Kelly:

1462
01:22:06.365 --> 01:22:08.500
Very good, miss James.

1463
01:22:08.534 --> 01:22:10.535
Why, thank you.

1464
01:22:10.569 --> 01:22:12.203
You ready?

1465
01:22:12.238 --> 01:22:15.206
You bet, Mr. Anderson.

1466
01:22:17.610 --> 01:22:20.712
One thing, though.
I was, uh,


1467
01:22:20.746 --> 01:22:22.814
I was kind of hoping
I had your permission


1468
01:22:22.848 --> 01:22:24.149
to call you something else.

1469
01:22:24.183 --> 01:22:26.151
Why?
You sick of miss James?


1470
01:22:26.185 --> 01:22:28.286
No, no, no.
I think it's pretty cute.


1471
01:22:28.320 --> 01:22:30.088
But I was thinking of something

1472
01:22:30.122 --> 01:22:32.357
more along the lines of
Mrs. Anderson.


1473
01:22:32.391 --> 01:22:34.325
Kelly:

1474
01:22:34.360 --> 01:22:37.962
Well, there are certain steps

1475
01:22:37.997 --> 01:22:41.366
that should probably
be taken first.


1476
01:22:41.400 --> 01:22:44.235
Steps or gifts?

1477
01:22:44.270 --> 01:22:45.703
Both.

1478
01:22:45.738 --> 01:22:48.273
Don't worry.

1479
01:22:48.307 --> 01:22:50.241
You're pretty good at those.

1480
01:22:51.710 --> 01:22:53.211
All right, then.

1481
01:22:53.245 --> 01:22:54.579
Ready?

1482
01:22:54.613 --> 01:22:56.614
Yeah.

1483
01:22:56.649 --> 01:22:58.750
- Here we go.
- Oh, man.


1484
01:23:00.019 --> 01:23:01.319
I'll beat you down.

1485
01:23:01.353 --> 01:23:03.154
Oh, are you?
I don't know.


1486
01:23:03.189 --> 01:23:04.889
Catch me.
