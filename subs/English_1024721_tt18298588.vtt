00:00:53.089 --> 00:00:54.720
<i>I wanna tell you a story.</i>

2
00:00:57.308 --> 00:00:59.608
<i>Ever since I was young,</i>

3
00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:02.358
<i>there was something
different about my family.</i>


4
00:01:03.485 --> 00:01:04.730
<i>A secret.</i>

5
00:01:06.566 --> 00:01:10.900
<i>Mom reckoned she'd been
followed her whole life.</i>


6
00:01:10.941 --> 00:01:13.566
<i>Well, this one time,
we're at the beach,</i>


7
00:01:13.608 --> 00:01:17.816
<i>and Mom sees this guy
pointing a camera at us.</i>


8
00:01:17.858 --> 00:01:19.983
<i>She starts going off at him,</i>

9
00:01:20.025 --> 00:01:24.275
<i>but he's just
frozen watching us.</i>


10
00:01:24.316 --> 00:01:29.651
<i>He says, "I'm sorry, this is
just the way it has to be."</i>


11
00:01:30.214 --> 00:01:31.698
<i>And then he runs.</i>

12
00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:34.483
<i>Until slam!</i>

13
00:01:34.525 --> 00:01:36.878
<i>He jumps straight
in front of a car.</i>


14
00:01:37.095 --> 00:01:38.678
<i>Like it was deliberate.</i>

15
00:01:39.072 --> 00:01:40.526
<i>Dead on impact.</i>

16
00:01:42.871 --> 00:01:45.454
<i>After the ambulance
takes him away,</i>


17
00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:48.354
<i>I pick up the camera he dropped.</i>

18
00:01:48.379 --> 00:01:51.066
<i>It's a model I've never seen,</i>

19
00:01:51.108 --> 00:01:54.441
<i>and there are thousands
of photos on it,</i>


20
00:01:55.054 --> 00:01:58.096
<i>and every single photo</i>

21
00:01:58.121 --> 00:02:00.983
<i>is of Mom and our family.</i>

22
00:02:01.025 --> 00:02:03.650
<i>At the swimming pool,
outside our house,</i>


23
00:02:03.691 --> 00:02:05.417
<i>at the movies,
the supermarket...</i>


24
00:02:07.733 --> 00:02:09.775
<i>A photo of my brother
smoking a bong.</i>


25
00:02:09.816 --> 00:02:13.270
<i>Mom wasn't crazy.</i>

26
00:02:13.295 --> 00:02:17.434
<i>She had been followed her whole
life. But it was impossible...</i>


27
00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:18.925
<i>Do you think you can send me</i>

28
00:02:18.949 --> 00:02:20.233
<i>these photos, Jarad?</i>

29
00:02:20.275 --> 00:02:23.137
<i>See, we gave the
camera to the cops,</i>


30
00:02:23.162 --> 00:02:25.120
<i>but months later, they tell us,</i>

31
00:02:25.145 --> 00:02:27.956
<i>they have no record
of this stalker.</i>


32
00:02:27.981 --> 00:02:30.525
<i>Like, he never existed.</i>

33
00:02:30.566 --> 00:02:34.983
<i>And the camera just disappeared.</i>

34
00:02:35.025 --> 00:02:36.768
<i>So you don't have any evidence</i>

35
00:02:36.793 --> 00:02:38.799
<i>of any of this happening?</i>

36
00:02:38.824 --> 00:02:41.028
<i>Oh, don't you get it?</i>

37
00:02:41.053 --> 00:02:43.900
<i>This stalker was a secret
agent from the future,</i>


38
00:02:43.941 --> 00:02:46.566
<i>and our family play a
really important part</i>


39
00:02:46.608 --> 00:02:48.588
<i>in something that happens
in a future timeline.</i>


40
00:02:48.613 --> 00:02:50.983
<i>That's...</i>

41
00:02:51.025 --> 00:02:53.566
<i>That's a pretty big leap, Jarad.</i>

42
00:02:53.608 --> 00:02:55.941
<i>You don't believe me.</i>

43
00:02:56.949 --> 00:02:58.753
<i>I know you, lady.</i>

44
00:02:58.887 --> 00:03:00.346
<i>You think I'm a joke?</i>

45
00:03:00.371 --> 00:03:01.858
<i>You're the joke.</i>

46
00:03:02.224 --> 00:03:04.307
<i>I watched you online.</i>

47
00:03:04.332 --> 00:03:07.520
<i>I know the kind
of person you are.</i>


48
00:03:07.545 --> 00:03:11.651
<i>You're a fraud! After the shit
you pulled on your last gig,</i>


49
00:03:11.676 --> 00:03:13.358
<i>you should be working at
a fuckin' donut shop...</i>


50
00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:14.824
- <i>Jarad.
- Not making the news.</i>


51
00:03:14.849 --> 00:03:16.207
<i>I'm gonna hang up now, okay?</i>

52
00:03:16.232 --> 00:03:17.635
<i>I'm the chosen one, bitch!</i>

53
00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:19.284
<i>I'm freakin' 
Harry Pot...</i>

54
00:03:27.708 --> 00:03:31.083
<i>I wanna tell you a story.</i>

55
00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:34.035
<i>All you have to do</i>

56
00:03:34.623 --> 00:03:35.996
<i>is listen.</i>

57
00:03:37.483 --> 00:03:39.354
<i>I would like to
publicly apologize</i>


58
00:03:39.379 --> 00:03:41.770
<i>for my recent mistakes</i>

59
00:03:41.795 --> 00:03:45.612
<i>when I was reporting on the
history of David Langley.</i>


60
00:03:45.637 --> 00:03:49.457
<i>I failed to corroborate evidence</i>

61
00:03:49.482 --> 00:03:54.016
<i>and thoroughly investigate
my key source's background.</i>


62
00:03:54.041 --> 00:03:57.207
<i>And I would like to clarify that</i>

63
00:03:57.232 --> 00:04:00.833
<i>Mr. Langley was cleared
of any criminal offenses</i>


64
00:04:00.858 --> 00:04:04.613
<i>related to the
claims in my article.</i>


65

<i>The Evening Journal's objective

Thank you for your time.

70
00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:34.500
Chew and chew and chew.

71
00:04:34.525 --> 00:04:36.084
Peter Piper picked a
peck of pickled peppers.


72
00:04:36.108 --> 00:04:37.828
A peck of pickled... shit.

73
00:04:40.026 --> 00:04:42.526
Welcome to Beyond Believable,

74
00:04:42.551 --> 00:04:44.854
the podcast that investigates

75
00:04:44.879 --> 00:04:47.776
the unbelievable
firsthand accounts of...


76
00:04:47.801 --> 00:04:49.733
Beyond Believable,

77
00:04:50.192 --> 00:04:52.525
the show that unmasks
the mysteries...


78
00:04:55.525 --> 00:04:57.198
This is a clickbait podcast

79
00:04:57.223 --> 00:04:59.025
made for bored, lonely ball bags

80
00:04:59.066 --> 00:05:02.408
with IQ levels below a
lobotomized monkey. Enjoy.


81
00:05:02.433 --> 00:05:05.848
I want to expose the truth.

82
00:05:12.216 --> 00:05:14.434
<i>Hey, it's me.</i>

83
00:05:14.459 --> 00:05:16.137
<i>I just wanted to officially
welcome you to the team.</i>


84
00:05:16.162 --> 00:05:18.151
<i>We're so excited that
you're gonna jump on board.</i>


85
00:05:18.176 --> 00:05:19.339
<i>I know it's a little</i>

86
00:05:19.364 --> 00:05:20.698
<i>beneath what you're used to,</i>

87
00:05:20.723 --> 00:05:23.066
<i>a little mystery podcast, but...</i>

88
00:05:23.108 --> 00:05:25.169
<i>I figure with everything
going on, it could be</i>


89
00:05:25.194 --> 00:05:26.870
<i>a great opportunity for you.</i>

90
00:05:26.895 --> 00:05:28.316
<i>So, call me when you can.</i>

91
00:05:28.341 --> 00:05:29.307
<i>We can plan your first story...</i>

92
00:05:31.941 --> 00:05:35.150
<i>Oh, hey, just checking in
to see how you're going.</i>


93
00:05:35.191 --> 00:05:36.713
<i>I'm just, you know, I
know you're probably</i>


94
00:05:36.738 --> 00:05:38.025
<i>looking for the right story,</i>

95
00:05:38.066 --> 00:05:39.858
<i>something that
really sings to you.</i>


96
00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:40.760
<i>But to be honest, we
just need to get...</i>


97
00:05:43.278 --> 00:05:44.691
<i>Now, seriously.</i>

98
00:05:44.733 --> 00:05:46.824
<i>I've been nice up to this point,</i>

99
00:05:46.849 --> 00:05:48.308
<i>but I stuck my neck out for you</i>

100
00:05:48.333 --> 00:05:50.042
<i>when nobody else
would touch you.</i>


101
00:05:50.067 --> 00:05:51.481
<i>I'm getting a lot of heat here,</i>

102
00:05:51.506 --> 00:05:52.823
<i>and I need you to deliver
and deliver today...</i>


103
00:06:47.488 --> 00:06:48.831
<i>Hello?</i>

104
00:06:48.856 --> 00:06:52.525
Hi. Is this, uh, 
Floramae King?

105
00:06:52.566 --> 00:06:55.887
<i>Yes. Who is this, please?</i>

106
00:06:55.912 --> 00:06:59.893
I'm a journalist from a podcast
called Beyond Believable.


107
00:06:59.918 --> 00:07:01.753
It's about mysteries that...

108
00:07:01.778 --> 00:07:03.650
<i>Sorry, I can't
hear you well, hon.</i>


109
00:07:03.691 --> 00:07:05.483
<i>Hang on a tick, I'll
go into the other room.</i>


110
00:07:05.525 --> 00:07:07.192
<i>Mom.</i>
-No worries.

111
00:07:07.217 --> 00:07:09.077
<i>Put that back
before you break it!</i>


112
00:07:09.102 --> 00:07:10.643
<i>Sorry. Yes?</i>

113
00:07:10.668 --> 00:07:12.733
I received a, uh

114
00:07:12.775 --> 00:07:15.424
well, I guess you'd call
it an anonymous tip-off


115
00:07:15.449 --> 00:07:17.316
about a brick.

116
00:07:17.358 --> 00:07:18.983
<i>Is this about Paula's boy?</i>

117
00:07:19.008 --> 00:07:20.926
<i>I told him to stop
lobbing bricks</i>


118
00:07:20.951 --> 00:07:22.713
<i>into that empty house
on Hunter's Road.</i>


119
00:07:22.738 --> 00:07:24.584
Uh, no.

120
00:07:24.609 --> 00:07:27.026
Look. It's probably nothing,

121
00:07:27.051 --> 00:07:30.319
but I received an email
about some sort of


122
00:07:30.344 --> 00:07:32.707
specific brick, and you.

123
00:07:37.150 --> 00:07:40.150
Hello, Ms. King, are you there?

124
00:07:40.596 --> 00:07:42.721
The email wasn't very clear,

125
00:07:42.746 --> 00:07:44.831
but they gave me
your phone number.


126
00:07:44.856 --> 00:07:47.483
<i>Who gave you my phone number?</i>

127
00:07:48.008 --> 00:07:49.692
As I said, they were anonymous.

128
00:07:49.717 --> 00:07:52.043
<i>My daughter is over for lunch</i>

129
00:07:52.068 --> 00:07:54.276
<i>and I don't think that we
should be talking about this.</i>


130
00:07:54.301 --> 00:07:55.775
It won't take a moment.

131
00:07:55.816 --> 00:07:58.941
I just want to ask you a
couple of quick questions.


132
00:07:58.983 --> 00:08:01.049
<i>What's this for, again?</i>

133
00:08:01.074 --> 00:08:03.137
It's for a podcast.

134
00:08:03.162 --> 00:08:05.081
<i>I thought you said
you were a journalist.</i>


135
00:08:05.106 --> 00:08:06.733
I am.

136
00:08:06.775 --> 00:08:09.026
All I want is a little
background information,


137
00:08:09.051 --> 00:08:11.733
and then I will be on my way.

138
00:08:11.775 --> 00:08:14.426
Is there anything you
could tell me about it?


139
00:08:14.708 --> 00:08:18.378
<i>The brick was such
a long time ago.</i>


140
00:08:18.403 --> 00:08:19.733
When you say brick,

141
00:08:19.775 --> 00:08:21.483
I'm not sure I
understand what you mean.


142
00:08:21.525 --> 00:08:25.457
Like, a house brick,
or something...?


143
00:08:25.482 --> 00:08:28.364
<i>No. It</i>

144
00:08:28.592 --> 00:08:31.879
<i>it was like nothing
I'd ever seen.</i>


145
00:08:31.904 --> 00:08:36.091
<i>It... It changed my life.</i>
-How?

146
00:08:36.116 --> 00:08:39.176
<i>These aren't good memories.
I shouldn't talk about this.</i>


147
00:08:39.201 --> 00:08:41.018
<i>It's a very long time ago, and
I don't think I can help you.</i>


148
00:08:41.043 --> 00:08:42.458
Ms. King.

149
00:08:42.873 --> 00:08:44.746
Can I call you Floramae?

150
00:08:46.020 --> 00:08:48.025
<i>I guess.</i>

151
00:08:48.066 --> 00:08:51.400
I'm thinking that if I
got this anonymous email,


152
00:08:51.441 --> 00:08:54.307
I wouldn't be surprised if
other journalists have too.


153
00:08:54.332 --> 00:08:56.608
<i>- Really?</i>
- Mm.


154
00:08:56.650 --> 00:08:59.706
I don't want other people to
twist your words, Floramae.


155
00:08:59.731 --> 00:09:01.753
<i>No.</i>

156
00:09:01.778 --> 00:09:03.934
So let me tell your
story properly.


157
00:09:03.959 --> 00:09:07.020
It'll only take five
minutes, promise.


158
00:09:08.988 --> 00:09:11.115
<i>Okay. Five minutes.</i>

159
00:09:11.150 --> 00:09:13.702
I just wanna let you
know I'm recording this.


160
00:09:13.727 --> 00:09:15.137
Is that okay?

161
00:09:15.419 --> 00:09:17.410
<i>Mm-hm.</i>

162
00:09:17.983 --> 00:09:20.753
You said this happened
a long time ago.


163
00:09:20.778 --> 00:09:24.160
How long ago are we talking?

164
00:09:24.185 --> 00:09:27.643
<i>It's gotta be close on

165
00:09:27.676 --> 00:09:29.799
Can you tell me what your
life was like back then?


166
00:09:29.824 --> 00:09:31.483
<i>I worked for a family.</i>

167
00:09:31.525 --> 00:09:34.275
<i>Housework, cleaning,
looking after their kid.</i>


168
00:09:34.316 --> 00:09:38.034
<i>Nice people, but
a bit well-to-do.</i>


169
00:09:38.059 --> 00:09:39.674
<i>- You know the sort.</i>
- Sure.


170
00:09:39.699 --> 00:09:41.250
<i>But good employers.</i>

171
00:09:41.275 --> 00:09:42.858
<i>They were even
paying to put my girl</i>


172
00:09:42.910 --> 00:09:45.400
<i>on a scholarship
to a good school.</i>


173
00:09:45.441 --> 00:09:48.106
<i>They treated her like she
was their own daughter.</i>


174
00:09:48.131 --> 00:09:51.840
<i>We were so grateful for
everything they gave us.</i>


175
00:09:52.605 --> 00:09:54.998
But something went wrong?

176
00:09:55.150 --> 00:09:58.215
<i>One day, something
happened in the house that</i>


177
00:09:58.240 --> 00:10:00.111
<i>I still can't explain.</i>

178
00:10:00.136 --> 00:10:01.520
What do you mean?

179
00:10:03.011 --> 00:10:04.949
<i>I don't know if I can say it.</i>

180
00:10:05.900 --> 00:10:08.876
I'm not here to
judge you, Floramae.


181
00:10:08.901 --> 00:10:10.473
I just wanna listen.

182
00:10:12.310 --> 00:10:14.750
<i>Well, one day, 
I came in to find</i>

183
00:10:14.775 --> 00:10:17.260
<i>all this terrible damage
to their furniture.</i>


184
00:10:17.285 --> 00:10:19.483
<i>Big, awful scratches
across everything.</i>


185
00:10:19.525 --> 00:10:21.525
<i>The dining table was the worst.</i>

186
00:10:21.566 --> 00:10:23.941
<i>It was like somebody
was so angry,</i>


187
00:10:23.983 --> 00:10:25.501
<i>they grabbed the sharpest
knife they could find</i>


188
00:10:25.525 --> 00:10:28.400
<i>and stabbed and
stabbed at the table,</i>


189
00:10:28.441 --> 00:10:31.346
<i>making these big,
deep scratches.</i>


190
00:10:31.380 --> 00:10:33.541
Sounds really frightening.

191
00:10:33.566 --> 00:10:37.316
<i>It was, but... but it got worse.</i>

192
00:10:37.358 --> 00:10:40.307
<i>The family thought that
my girl Paula had done it.</i>


193
00:10:40.332 --> 00:10:42.483
<i>She was only a kid</i>

194
00:10:42.525 --> 00:10:44.924
<i>and she swore black
and blue she didn't,</i>


195
00:10:44.949 --> 00:10:47.629
<i>but they didn't believe her.</i>

196
00:10:48.034 --> 00:10:49.887
Did you think she did it?

197
00:10:51.353 --> 00:10:52.957
<i>It makes me ashamed.</i>

198
00:10:54.035 --> 00:10:56.750
<i>Paula never admitted it.</i>

199
00:10:56.775 --> 00:10:59.272
<i>There was a lot of pressure,</i>

200
00:10:59.297 --> 00:11:01.797
<i>and I didn't feel that I
could stand up to them.</i>


201
00:11:02.405 --> 00:11:05.202
<i>I didn't believe her.</i>

202
00:11:05.227 --> 00:11:08.046
<i>Over the years, I've
always wondered...</i>


203
00:11:10.878 --> 00:11:14.077
If she didn't destroy
the furniture, who did?


204
00:11:15.442 --> 00:11:17.275
<i>Exactly.</i>

205
00:11:17.316 --> 00:11:19.566
<i>It caused big
trouble in the house,</i>


206
00:11:19.608 --> 00:11:21.621
<i>and the family turned on us,</i>

207
00:11:21.646 --> 00:11:23.875
<i>turned on Paula.</i>

208
00:11:23.900 --> 00:11:26.025
<i>And I couldn't do
anything to stop it.</i>


209
00:11:26.059 --> 00:11:28.358
<i>I couldn't help my
little girl, and...</i>


210
00:11:28.400 --> 00:11:30.799
<i>I was such a terrible
mother, and...</i>


211
00:11:33.815 --> 00:11:37.565
<i>And that's when I received
the strangest thing.</i>


212
00:11:37.590 --> 00:11:40.603
<i>This black brick.</i>

213
00:11:40.955 --> 00:11:43.861
What do you mean, received it?

214
00:11:43.886 --> 00:11:45.229
How?

215
00:11:47.941 --> 00:11:49.789
<i>I... I don't remember.</i>

216
00:11:49.814 --> 00:11:51.566
You don't remember?

217
00:11:52.153 --> 00:11:54.653
<i>It was a long time ago.</i>

218
00:11:54.923 --> 00:11:56.228
It's okay.

219
00:11:56.511 --> 00:12:00.283
Can you tell me what
the brick was like?


220
00:12:02.025 --> 00:12:04.734
<i>It was darker than
anything I've ever seen</i>


221
00:12:04.759 --> 00:12:07.095
<i>and heavy.</i>

222
00:12:07.923 --> 00:12:09.733
<i>It was special.</i>

223
00:12:09.775 --> 00:12:11.926
<i>As soon as I held
it, I felt like</i>


224
00:12:11.951 --> 00:12:14.603
<i>something was changing.</i>

225
00:12:16.461 --> 00:12:18.337
<i>But then...</i>

226
00:12:19.681 --> 00:12:21.330
What happened?

227
00:12:22.384 --> 00:12:24.620
<i>The couple I was working for,</i>

228
00:12:24.705 --> 00:12:26.691
<i>their kid took it from me.</i>

229
00:12:26.733 --> 00:12:28.566
<i>And when the husband saw it,</i>

230
00:12:28.608 --> 00:12:30.648
<i>he thought he could
make some money.</i>


231
00:12:30.673 --> 00:12:33.156
<i>He told me it was art.</i>

232
00:12:33.181 --> 00:12:35.344
<i>I'll never forgive
him for selling it.</i>


233
00:12:35.369 --> 00:12:37.298
He sold it without
your permission?


234
00:12:37.323 --> 00:12:39.969
<i>After they decided my Paula
ruined their furniture,</i>


235
00:12:39.994 --> 00:12:42.041
<i>we had to pay for the damage.</i>

236
00:12:42.066 --> 00:12:44.984
<i>So they took the brick
as part of the payment.</i>


237
00:12:45.009 --> 00:12:47.024
<i>It makes me wild.</i>

238
00:12:47.049 --> 00:12:49.133
Who'd he sell it to?

239
00:12:49.158 --> 00:12:51.523
<i>Some art collector.</i>

240
00:12:51.611 --> 00:12:53.484
Do you remember a name?

241
00:12:53.509 --> 00:12:57.858
<i>Something German. 
Lang, maybe?</i>

242
00:12:57.900 --> 00:13:00.191
That must've made you
feel really awful.


243
00:13:00.233 --> 00:13:02.316
<i>I tried to stop it.</i>
-Mm.

244
00:13:02.358 --> 00:13:05.078
<i>I told the couple that
that brick was mine.</i>


245
00:13:05.103 --> 00:13:06.441
<i>You know, people can't go around</i>

246
00:13:06.483 --> 00:13:08.525
<i>selling what's not
theirs, can they?</i>


247
00:13:08.566 --> 00:13:10.733
<i>But as soon as the
family found out</i>


248
00:13:10.775 --> 00:13:13.191
<i>I wanted to go to
the authorities,</i>


249
00:13:14.033 --> 00:13:15.811
<i>they removed me.</i>

250
00:13:16.584 --> 00:13:18.250
They fired you.

251
00:13:18.275 --> 00:13:20.025
<i>Easy as you please.</i>

252
00:13:20.353 --> 00:13:23.061
<i>Years of service gone.</i>

253
00:13:23.941 --> 00:13:26.022
<i>I never heard from them again.</i>

254
00:13:26.858 --> 00:13:29.650
<i>I never saw the brick again.</i>

255
00:13:29.691 --> 00:13:33.747
What do you think this
brick was, Floramae?


256
00:13:33.772 --> 00:13:35.441
<i>I'm not sure.</i>

257
00:13:35.483 --> 00:13:37.983
<i>Maybe nothing.</i>

258
00:13:38.025 --> 00:13:40.115
Somebody thought it
was interesting enough


259
00:13:40.140 --> 00:13:42.775
to email me about.

260
00:13:42.816 --> 00:13:46.775
And you say the brick
was special, right?


261
00:13:47.369 --> 00:13:49.286
What'd it make you feel?

262
00:13:51.858 --> 00:13:55.046
<i>Sometimes, I think
I can still feel it.</i>


263
00:13:55.071 --> 00:13:57.036
<i>That power,</i>

264
00:13:57.061 --> 00:14:00.816
<i>like something unfinished.</i>

265
00:14:01.497 --> 00:14:03.497
<i>I can't explain it.</i>

266
00:14:03.522 --> 00:14:05.275
<i>I don't know.</i>

267
00:14:05.316 --> 00:14:08.663
<i>This was 20 years
ago, it's silly.</i>


268
00:14:08.688 --> 00:14:12.536
<i>I thought that there was
some kind of power over me.</i>


269
00:14:12.561 --> 00:14:14.833
<i>Yeah, it was probably
all in my head.</i>


270
00:14:14.858 --> 00:14:17.586
<i>Sorry if this is a dead-end.</i>

271
00:14:17.611 --> 00:14:19.361
It's okay.

272
00:14:19.386 --> 00:14:21.334
Maybe there's something that
will jog your memory. We can...


273
00:14:21.358 --> 00:14:23.775
<i>Mom, come on, lunch
is just sitting.</i>


274
00:14:23.816 --> 00:14:25.251
<i>I know, it's getting
cold.- Who is that?</i>


275
00:14:25.275 --> 00:14:26.626
<i>I'll pop it in the
microwave, hon.</i>


276
00:14:26.650 --> 00:14:27.867
<i>- Give it to me.
- Hang on a tick.</i>


277
00:14:27.892 --> 00:14:29.234
<i>Hang on, Paula.</i>

278
00:14:29.259 --> 00:14:31.358
<i>Hello, who is this?</i>

279
00:14:31.400 --> 00:14:33.525
Sorry, I was speaking
with Floramae...


280
00:14:33.564 --> 00:14:36.566
<i>Whatever you're selling,
leave Mom alone.</i>


281
00:14:36.608 --> 00:14:38.542
<i>- Paula! You don't...
- People need to stop calling.</i>


282
00:14:38.566 --> 00:14:41.650
<i>She doesn't need any
more crap in her house.</i>


283
00:14:41.691 --> 00:14:44.858
- No, of course.
<i>- Sorry, it's just...</i>


284
00:14:44.900 --> 00:14:46.334
<i>- You understand, right?
- Hang on. Paula!</i>


285
00:14:54.651 --> 00:14:56.564
<i>Godmorgen, mit barn.</i>

286
00:14:56.589 --> 00:14:58.376
<i>Just calling to let you
know we've made it to...</i>


287
00:14:58.400 --> 00:15:01.267
<i>Beautiful Copenhagen!</i>

288
00:15:01.292 --> 00:15:03.959
<i>We're alive and well in
our very lovely hotel.</i>


289
00:15:03.984 --> 00:15:06.572
<i>Why do the Danes have
to pickle everything?</i>


290
00:15:06.597 --> 00:15:08.739
<i>And your mother's already
complaining about all the fish.</i>


291
00:15:08.764 --> 00:15:10.642
<i>Darling, we can get you a
new jacket, if you like.</i>


292
00:15:10.667 --> 00:15:12.583
<i>She doesn't want a jacket.</i>

293
00:15:12.608 --> 00:15:14.441
<i>Don't be stupid,
of course she does.</i>


294
00:15:14.483 --> 00:15:15.805
<i>There's some leftovers
in the freezer.</i>


295
00:15:15.830 --> 00:15:16.775
<i>And don't forget,</i>

296
00:15:16.816 --> 00:15:18.066
<i>Ian's tank needs to be cleaned</i>

297
00:15:18.108 --> 00:15:20.650
<i>twice a week.</i>

298
00:15:20.691 --> 00:15:24.970
<i>We heard about the new
podcast. Sounds interesting.</i>


299
00:15:24.995 --> 00:15:27.287
<i>Good little diversion after
everything that's happened.</i>


300
00:15:27.312 --> 00:15:28.917
<i>Obviously, those bastards
at The Evening Journal</i>


301
00:15:28.941 --> 00:15:31.275
<i>had no right to
scapegoat you like that.</i>


302
00:15:31.316 --> 00:15:32.959
<i>You know you did the
right thing with Langley</i>


303
00:15:32.983 --> 00:15:34.340
<i>and you've got nothing
to apologize...</i>


304
00:15:46.691 --> 00:15:49.445
<i>Lang Contemporary. Frau
Schmidt. Guten tag.</i>


305
00:15:49.470 --> 00:15:50.695
Hallo,

306
00:15:50.720 --> 00:15:54.398
kann ich bitte mit
Klaus Lang sprechen?


307
00:15:54.423 --> 00:15:56.358
- Sorry.
<i>- Of course.</i>


308
00:15:56.740 --> 00:15:58.406
<i>May I ask why you are calling?</i>

309
00:16:03.066 --> 00:16:04.900
<i>I never thought I
would get a call</i>


310
00:16:04.941 --> 00:16:07.203
<i>about these funny
little objects of mine.</i>


311
00:16:07.228 --> 00:16:09.816
Hi, Mr. Lang.

312
00:16:09.858 --> 00:16:13.858
I, uh, work for a podcast
called Beyond Believable.


313
00:16:13.900 --> 00:16:17.316
It's about unsolved mysteries,
hoaxes, that kind of thing.


314
00:16:17.358 --> 00:16:22.025
I, uh, came across a
story about a black brick


315
00:16:22.066 --> 00:16:25.358
that you bought from an
Australian man many years ago,


316
00:16:25.400 --> 00:16:29.233
and I just wanna corroborate
a few details with you.


317
00:16:29.275 --> 00:16:32.445
<i>Most curious. A hoax?
I'm not so sure.</i>


318
00:16:32.470 --> 00:16:33.986
Before we go any further,

319
00:16:34.011 --> 00:16:36.617
I'm letting you know I'm
recording our conversation


320
00:16:36.642 --> 00:16:37.844
for the podcast.

321
00:16:37.869 --> 00:16:38.941
Do you mind?

322
00:16:38.983 --> 00:16:42.066
<i>You're already recording?</i>

323
00:16:42.108 --> 00:16:44.523
I've found it's always
better to ask for forgiveness


324
00:16:44.548 --> 00:16:45.398
than permission.

325
00:16:47.150 --> 00:16:49.733
<i>I agree entirely. Go ahead.</i>

326
00:16:49.775 --> 00:16:54.108
So you're telling me this
object really exists?


327
00:16:54.150 --> 00:16:57.566
<i>Yes, yes, in fact,
I have several.</i>


328
00:16:58.259 --> 00:16:59.775
What do you mean, several?

329
00:16:59.824 --> 00:17:01.860
<i>See, I am also very interested</i>

330
00:17:01.885 --> 00:17:03.791
<i>in this phenomenon.</i>

331
00:17:03.816 --> 00:17:05.976
<i>When I was a very young man,</i>

332
00:17:06.001 --> 00:17:08.358
<i>I also received a brick.</i>

333
00:17:08.784 --> 00:17:10.617
You're kidding me.

334
00:17:10.642 --> 00:17:12.900
<i>Not at all, not at all.</i>

335
00:17:12.941 --> 00:17:16.608
<i>And I've been fascinated
with them ever since.</i>


336
00:17:16.650 --> 00:17:18.469
So you're saying
there's more than one


337
00:17:18.494 --> 00:17:20.166
of these objects out there.

338
00:17:20.191 --> 00:17:22.351
<i>I know of at least a
dozen around the world,</i>


339
00:17:22.376 --> 00:17:24.708
<i>of which I have a few,</i>

340
00:17:25.166 --> 00:17:27.495
<i>each exactly the same.</i>

341
00:17:27.520 --> 00:17:29.666
<i>Most peculiar. 
Very collectible.</i>

342
00:17:31.355 --> 00:17:35.705
And how did you receive
your brick, Mr. Lang?


343
00:17:37.181 --> 00:17:41.541
<i>It was, uh, just,
uh, in my house.</i>


344
00:17:41.566 --> 00:17:45.445
Can you, uh, can you
describe these bricks?


345
00:17:45.470 --> 00:17:47.233
<i>They are black.</i>

346
00:17:47.275 --> 00:17:49.775
<i>About the size of a gold bar,</i>

347
00:17:49.816 --> 00:17:53.900
<i>but darker than any
other object I have seen.</i>


348
00:17:53.941 --> 00:17:57.914
<i>Very heavy, not manmade,
but not natural either.</i>


349
00:17:57.939 --> 00:18:00.047
It's either one
or the other, no?


350
00:18:00.072 --> 00:18:01.805
<i>I thought like this.</i>

351
00:18:01.830 --> 00:18:03.566
<i>So several years ago,</i>

352
00:18:03.608 --> 00:18:05.816
<i>I took these artifacts
to a friend of mine,</i>


353
00:18:05.858 --> 00:18:09.566
<i>and she made scans with
the new technology.</i>


354
00:18:09.608 --> 00:18:11.941
<i>They call it
volumetric scanning.</i>


355
00:18:11.983 --> 00:18:14.108
<i>You can make a
three-dimensional image</i>


356
00:18:14.150 --> 00:18:16.656
<i>of the interior
without opening it up.</i>


357
00:18:16.681 --> 00:18:19.191
<i>- Very cool, huh?</i>
- And?


358
00:18:19.233 --> 00:18:21.483
<i>I have never seen
anything like it.</i>


359
00:18:21.525 --> 00:18:23.566
<i>Uh, the interior of each brick</i>

360
00:18:23.608 --> 00:18:26.312
<i>is filled with
hundreds of symbols</i>


361
00:18:26.337 --> 00:18:27.837
<i>folded into each other.</i>

362
00:18:27.862 --> 00:18:29.945
Can you send me these scans?

363
00:18:29.970 --> 00:18:32.191
<i>It was years ago.</i>

364
00:18:32.233 --> 00:18:34.108
<i>I'll see if I can dig them up.</i>

365
00:18:34.133 --> 00:18:37.816
<i>Perhaps you can make
something of them.</i>


366
00:18:37.858 --> 00:18:41.316
And these symbols...
what alphabet is it?


367
00:18:41.358 --> 00:18:45.691
Latin, Arabic,
Cyrillic, hieroglyphic?


368
00:18:45.733 --> 00:18:49.441
<i>Each brick has its own
unique set of symbols.</i>


369
00:18:49.483 --> 00:18:53.025
<i>But in mine, I see a symbol
that reminds me of a scar</i>


370
00:18:53.066 --> 00:18:56.236
<i>that I have had since
I was a small boy.</i>


371
00:18:56.261 --> 00:19:01.603
<i>It makes me think this brick
is speaking directly to me.</i>


372
00:19:03.236 --> 00:19:05.150
What do you mean?

373
00:19:05.191 --> 00:19:09.058
<i>Well, you see, uh...</i>

374
00:19:09.185 --> 00:19:11.101
<i>You probably think I'm crazy.</i>

375
00:19:11.126 --> 00:19:13.691
No. G-go on, please.

376
00:19:13.733 --> 00:19:18.415
<i>For a while, I thought I
was completely verruckt,</i>


377
00:19:18.440 --> 00:19:19.565
<i>crazy as a cuckoo.</i>

378
00:19:22.400 --> 00:19:25.150
<i>Many... many years ago,</i>

379
00:19:25.191 --> 00:19:27.358
<i>just before I received my brick,</i>

380
00:19:27.400 --> 00:19:30.066
<i>I-I had a very strange,
uh, what do you call it,</i>


381
00:19:30.108 --> 00:19:32.861
<i>like a... like a dream
when you are awake.</i>


382
00:19:32.886 --> 00:19:35.283
Uh, daydream?

383
00:19:35.308 --> 00:19:39.072
<i>Yeah, but it felt real.</i>

384
00:19:39.097 --> 00:19:41.041
<i>A vision.</i>

385
00:19:41.066 --> 00:19:44.814
<i>This awful creature
appeared in my bathroom.</i>


386
00:19:44.839 --> 00:19:46.564
Sorry, did you... a creature?

387
00:19:50.126 --> 00:19:51.533
<i>It was a man,</i>

388
00:19:51.558 --> 00:19:55.650
<i>but grotesque, awful.</i>

389
00:19:56.003 --> 00:19:59.483
<i>A face like wet bread.</i>

390
00:19:59.525 --> 00:20:03.066
<i>And it was most
extraordinary, but somehow,</i>


391
00:20:03.108 --> 00:20:07.275
<i>I knew this creature
was my brother.</i>


392
00:20:07.316 --> 00:20:09.691
<i>An awful, ugly version of him,</i>

393
00:20:09.733 --> 00:20:13.566
<i>this thing would
never say a word.</i>


394
00:20:13.608 --> 00:20:16.900
<i>But I knew it was my
brother all the same.</i>


395
00:20:17.995 --> 00:20:19.441
How?

396
00:20:20.081 --> 00:20:22.650
<i>A feeling.</i>

397
00:20:22.691 --> 00:20:25.150
<i>It was connected
to me and I to it.</i>


398
00:20:27.525 --> 00:20:30.259
<i>My brother was a
teenager when he died.</i>


399
00:20:30.284 --> 00:20:32.416
<i>He had a bad heart.</i>

400
00:20:32.441 --> 00:20:36.066
<i>Time was always against us.</i>

401
00:20:36.108 --> 00:20:40.233
<i>That creature in my
bathtub watching me,</i>


402
00:20:40.275 --> 00:20:43.503
<i>telling me what I
have always known.</i>


403
00:20:49.135 --> 00:20:50.482
Which is?

404
00:20:52.486 --> 00:20:55.292
<i>A part of me wanted him to die.</i>

405
00:20:58.207 --> 00:21:03.916
<i>He was so clever and
strong and loved.</i>


406
00:21:03.941 --> 00:21:07.033
<i>I could never compete.</i>

407
00:21:07.058 --> 00:21:08.822
<i>But then, he died.</i>

408
00:21:08.847 --> 00:21:10.150
<i>I felt</i>

409
00:21:11.104 --> 00:21:12.315
<i>happy.</i>

410
00:21:13.013 --> 00:21:14.347
<i>Relieved.</i>

411
00:21:16.858 --> 00:21:20.483
<i>And after this
terrible vision,</i>


412
00:21:20.509 --> 00:21:24.675
<i>that's when I
received the brick.</i>


413
00:21:26.275 --> 00:21:29.541
But this vision was just
your imagination, right?


414
00:21:29.566 --> 00:21:31.425
It wasn't actually real.

415
00:21:31.450 --> 00:21:34.369
<i>The logical thinking part of
my brain knew it wasn't real,</i>


416
00:21:34.394 --> 00:21:37.625
<i>but in my heart, it
felt differently.</i>


417
00:21:37.650 --> 00:21:42.058
<i>It was like a hallucination.</i>

418
00:21:42.083 --> 00:21:45.251
<i>Even after I locked the brick
away all those years ago,</i>


419
00:21:45.276 --> 00:21:47.423
<i>it still haunts me.</i>

420
00:21:47.448 --> 00:21:51.441
<i>A little less, but it's there.</i>

421
00:21:51.483 --> 00:21:54.689
What makes you think
you're not crazy, Mr. Lang?


422
00:21:56.566 --> 00:21:58.900
<i>You're right, yeah.</i>

423
00:21:58.941 --> 00:22:01.242
<i>A madman never thinks he's mad.</i>

424
00:22:02.667 --> 00:22:04.400
<i>But I am normally</i>

425
00:22:04.441 --> 00:22:06.736
<i>a very straight-ahead
kind of guy.</i>


426
00:22:06.761 --> 00:22:08.439
<i>No drink, no drugs.</i>

427
00:22:08.464 --> 00:22:10.095
<i>I like reality very much.</i>

428
00:22:12.191 --> 00:22:15.947
And you think this vision
is connected to the brick?


429
00:22:15.972 --> 00:22:17.361
<i>I'm certain of it.</i>

430
00:22:20.150 --> 00:22:22.288
<i>You don't believe me.</i>

431
00:22:25.028 --> 00:22:28.111
- No.
<i>- Okay. Very good.</i>


432
00:22:28.136 --> 00:22:30.316
<i>You are an investigator
of the facts,</i>


433
00:22:30.358 --> 00:22:33.750
<i>not some silly
conspiracy cuckoo.</i>


434
00:22:34.359 --> 00:22:36.150
<i>But know this:</i>

435
00:22:36.175 --> 00:22:37.983
<i>I am a good man.</i>

436
00:22:38.025 --> 00:22:40.931
<i>I do believe in the
truth, in facts,</i>


437
00:22:40.956 --> 00:22:42.681
<i>and when I held this brick,</i>

438
00:22:42.706 --> 00:22:46.359
<i>it felt like
something or someone</i>


439
00:22:46.384 --> 00:22:48.650
<i>was trying to talk to me.</i>

440
00:22:49.318 --> 00:22:53.375
<i>A message from far away.</i>

441
00:22:53.400 --> 00:22:57.408
Are you saying you think
this brick is alien?


442
00:22:57.433 --> 00:23:00.608
<i>If you don't believe me, I
am happy to send you a brick.</i>


443
00:23:00.650 --> 00:23:04.691
- Really?
<i>- Ja. For a small fee.</i>


444
00:23:05.417 --> 00:23:07.250
You're selling them.

445
00:23:07.275 --> 00:23:09.383
<i>Of course! Of course.</i>

446
00:23:09.408 --> 00:23:11.150
<i>I'm a businessman, after all.</i>

447
00:23:11.191 --> 00:23:13.117
<i>I am willing to
offer a good deal</i>


448
00:23:13.142 --> 00:23:15.070
<i>to a smart girl like you.</i>

449
00:23:15.095 --> 00:23:18.525
Well, thank you, but, uh,

450
00:23:18.550 --> 00:23:20.851
I think I have
everything I need.


451
00:23:20.876 --> 00:23:23.191
<i>Very well.</i>

452
00:23:23.233 --> 00:23:26.398
<i>I hope you find what
you're looking for.</i>


453
00:23:28.191 --> 00:23:30.275
Mr. Lang, just...

454
00:23:30.316 --> 00:23:33.400
- Just one more thing.
<i>- Ja.</i>


455
00:23:33.441 --> 00:23:35.695
That brick from Australia,
the man you bought it from


456
00:23:35.720 --> 00:23:37.816
sold it without permission.

457
00:23:37.858 --> 00:23:40.809
It was his housekeeper's,
originally.


458
00:23:40.834 --> 00:23:42.439
Did you know that?

459
00:23:44.719 --> 00:23:47.302
<i>Throw a rock and you
will hit a gallery</i>


460
00:23:47.327 --> 00:23:50.233
<i>filled with stolen artwork.</i>

461
00:23:50.275 --> 00:23:53.066
<i>It was once a German pastime.</i>

462
00:23:53.108 --> 00:23:55.005
I'm sure it's challenging
to remain ethical


463
00:23:55.030 --> 00:23:57.650
in your industry.

464
00:23:57.691 --> 00:23:59.608
<i>I really am quite busy,</i>

465
00:23:59.650 --> 00:24:02.005
<i>so if you have nothing
else you need...</i>


466
00:24:02.030 --> 00:24:04.775
Yes, thank you, um

467
00:24:04.816 --> 00:24:06.740
thank you for your
time, Mr. Lang.


468
00:24:06.765 --> 00:24:07.650
<i>Guten tag.</i>

469
00:24:13.665 --> 00:24:17.567
<i>So you're telling me this
object really exists?</i>


470
00:24:17.592 --> 00:24:19.279
<i>It was like nothing
I'd ever seen.</i>


471
00:24:19.304 --> 00:24:21.983
<i>It changed my life.</i>

472
00:24:22.025 --> 00:24:23.816
<i>I never thought I
would get a call</i>


473
00:24:23.858 --> 00:24:26.441
<i>about these funny
little objects of mine.</i>


474
00:24:26.483 --> 00:24:28.888
<i>That's when I received
the strangest thing,</i>


475
00:24:28.913 --> 00:24:30.566
<i>this black brick.</i>

476
00:24:30.608 --> 00:24:32.608
<i>About the size of a gold bar,</i>

477
00:24:32.650 --> 00:24:35.216
<i>darker than any other
object I have seen.</i>


478
00:24:36.790 --> 00:24:38.910
<i>How did you
receive your brick?</i>


479
00:24:38.935 --> 00:24:41.566
<i>You probably think I'm crazy.</i>

480
00:24:41.608 --> 00:24:43.334
<i>The brick was such
a long time ago.</i>


481
00:24:43.366 --> 00:24:46.193
<i>It felt like
something or someone</i>


482
00:24:46.218 --> 00:24:47.716
<i>was trying to talk to me.</i>

483
00:24:49.047 --> 00:24:51.865
<i>I thought that there was
some kind of power over me.</i>


484
00:24:51.890 --> 00:24:54.816
<i>A message from far away.</i>

485
00:24:54.858 --> 00:24:56.622
<i>Yeah, it was probably
all in my head.</i>


486
00:24:58.441 --> 00:25:01.349
<i>Come on, it can't be that bad.</i>

487
00:25:01.374 --> 00:25:04.025
Honestly, it's bad, Scott.

488
00:25:04.066 --> 00:25:08.982
Anonymous emails and visions
and weird scratchings.


489
00:25:09.007 --> 00:25:10.966
Oh, and let's not
forget the brick.


490
00:25:10.991 --> 00:25:14.818
I mean, come on,
it's ridiculous.


491
00:25:14.843 --> 00:25:16.941
A brick.

492
00:25:16.983 --> 00:25:18.762
Even the woman says it herself,

493
00:25:18.787 --> 00:25:21.029
it was probably
"all in my head."


494
00:25:21.054 --> 00:25:24.372
<i>Oh yeah. I know.</i>

495
00:25:24.397 --> 00:25:26.191
I can't release this.

496
00:25:26.913 --> 00:25:28.724
Tyler is going to fire me.

497
00:25:28.749 --> 00:25:31.233
<i>Maybe that's not so bad.</i>

498
00:25:31.275 --> 00:25:34.775
<i>Maybe you need a rest. A reset.</i>

499
00:25:34.816 --> 00:25:37.568
Seriously? Seriously, you think
I should let Tyler fire me?


500
00:25:37.593 --> 00:25:39.400
<i>No... no.</i>

501
00:25:39.441 --> 00:25:41.725
<i>But after everything
that's happened</i>


502
00:25:41.750 --> 00:25:43.541
<i>and the whole Langley thing,</i>

503
00:25:43.566 --> 00:25:44.858
<i>did you ever wonder if maybe...</i>

504
00:25:44.900 --> 00:25:47.858
My career is
completely destroyed?


505
00:25:47.900 --> 00:25:51.161
<i>Maybe you need a break.</i>

506
00:25:52.483 --> 00:25:54.358
Why does everyone
keep saying this?


507
00:25:54.400 --> 00:25:56.520
I don't need a break.

508
00:25:56.545 --> 00:25:58.358
I need a story.

509
00:25:59.530 --> 00:26:02.138
I can't hide away like I
did something wrong, Scott.


510
00:26:02.163 --> 00:26:06.154
<i>No, but... these
things take a toll.</i>


511
00:26:06.179 --> 00:26:08.241
<i>I miss you.</i>

512
00:26:08.266 --> 00:26:11.798
<i>I know this isn't fair,
but the article and then...</i>


513
00:26:11.823 --> 00:26:14.318
That Langley article
was important.


514
00:26:14.343 --> 00:26:18.288
- It was the truth.
<i>- Okay, okay.</i>


515
00:26:18.313 --> 00:26:21.185
You know, Langley's cheer squad
is camped outside my flat now.


516
00:26:21.210 --> 00:26:23.244
<i>What? Jesus.</i>

517
00:26:23.269 --> 00:26:26.069
Yeah. Some hero
must have doxed me.


518
00:26:27.082 --> 00:26:30.916
I've gone back to Mom
and Dad's for a bit.


519
00:26:30.941 --> 00:26:33.108
I thought coming
back here would help.


520
00:26:33.150 --> 00:26:37.765
Some time alone,
find a story, but...


521
00:26:39.225 --> 00:26:41.775
I am stuck.

522
00:26:41.816 --> 00:26:44.638
<i>It's okay to admit
that you're exhausted.</i>


523
00:26:44.663 --> 00:26:47.733
I'm not exhausted.
I am humiliated.


524
00:26:47.775 --> 00:26:50.388
I tried to do the right thing,
and look where it got me.


525
00:26:50.413 --> 00:26:52.122
<i>I know. But...</i>

526
00:26:54.650 --> 00:26:57.171
<i>This kind of work
isn't for everyone.</i>


527
00:27:00.736 --> 00:27:03.611
I've just got to make a story
that will make people listen.


528
00:27:04.636 --> 00:27:06.077
That is it.

529
00:27:10.566 --> 00:27:13.819
<i>Sometimes, I think
I can still feel it,</i>


530
00:27:13.844 --> 00:27:15.669
<i>that power,</i>

531
00:27:15.694 --> 00:27:20.083
<i>like something unfinished.</i>

532
00:27:20.108 --> 00:27:23.191
<i>I can't explain
it. I don't know.</i>


533
00:27:23.233 --> 00:27:26.882
<i>This was 20 years
ago, it's silly.</i>


534
00:27:26.907 --> 00:27:30.532
<i>I thought that there was
some kind of power over me.</i>


535
00:27:30.733 --> 00:27:33.147
<i>Yeah, it was probably
all in my head.</i>


536
00:27:36.525 --> 00:27:38.685
<i>Yeah, it was probably
all in my head.</i>


537
00:27:42.515 --> 00:27:44.400
<i>I can't explain it.</i>

538
00:27:44.441 --> 00:27:47.960
<i>I don't know, this
was 20 years a...</i>


539
00:27:57.319 --> 00:27:59.934
<i>Something unfinished.</i>

540
00:27:59.959 --> 00:28:01.874
<i>Some kind of power over me.</i>

541
00:28:04.765 --> 00:28:07.995
<i>Something unfinished.</i>

542
00:28:08.020 --> 00:28:10.187
<i>Some kind of power over me.</i>

543
00:28:20.691 --> 00:28:23.263
<i>As I listen to
Floramae and Klaus</i>


544
00:28:23.288 --> 00:28:25.482
<i>describe their experiences</i>

545
00:28:25.507 --> 00:28:28.441
<i>with these powerful,
dark objects,</i>


546
00:28:28.483 --> 00:28:31.900
<i>I feel a kind of
terror creep over me.</i>


547
00:28:31.941 --> 00:28:34.691
<i>Who sent this anonymous email</i>

548
00:28:34.733 --> 00:28:36.968
<i>and what do they
want me to find?</i>


549
00:28:38.316 --> 00:28:41.691
<i>Floramae's words haunt me.</i>

550
00:28:41.733 --> 00:28:44.999
<i>An object filled with
unknowable power.</i>


551
00:28:46.098 --> 00:28:48.791
<i>What do these
bricks want from us?</i>


552
00:28:48.816 --> 00:28:51.358
<i>To solve this mystery,</i>

553
00:28:51.400 --> 00:28:54.583
<i>I need your help, listeners.</i>

554
00:28:55.444 --> 00:28:57.358
<i>I wanna know,</i>

555
00:28:57.400 --> 00:28:59.608
<i>is there anyone out there
that knows anything,</i>


556
00:28:59.650 --> 00:29:03.400
<i>anything at all,
about these bricks?</i>


557
00:29:04.022 --> 00:29:08.365
And can we uncover the
dark forces behind them


558
00:29:08.390 --> 00:29:10.377
before it's too late?

559
00:29:30.064 --> 00:29:31.390
Okay.

560
00:29:36.892 --> 00:29:38.317
What do you reckon, Ian?

561
00:29:38.342 --> 00:29:41.175
Good idea? Bad idea?

562
00:29:42.776 --> 00:29:44.692
Undecided, huh?

563
00:30:14.983 --> 00:30:16.430
<i>Happy birthday.</i>

564
00:30:40.400 --> 00:30:43.361
<i>Are you saying you also
have one of these objects?</i>


565
00:30:43.386 --> 00:30:45.875
<i>Yes, ma'am. I received
it two years ago.</i>


566
00:30:45.900 --> 00:30:48.275
And you don't know
Floramae or Klaus Lang?


567
00:30:48.316 --> 00:30:50.400
<i>Never heard of 'em.</i>

568
00:30:50.441 --> 00:30:52.626
<i>But when I listened
to your podcast,</i>


569
00:30:52.651 --> 00:30:55.125
<i>I thought, "Laura Sully,
that's that damned rock."</i>


570
00:30:55.150 --> 00:30:56.775
<i>It feels like I've
been waiting years</i>


571
00:30:56.816 --> 00:30:59.608
<i>to talk to somebody like you.</i>

572
00:30:59.650 --> 00:31:03.650
Okay, then, um...
how did it all start?


573
00:31:03.691 --> 00:31:07.858
<i>A bit over two years
ago, I got ill.</i>


574
00:31:07.900 --> 00:31:09.844
<i>Stopped eating. 
Felt like hell.</i>

575
00:31:09.869 --> 00:31:11.522
Did you see a doctor?

576
00:31:11.547 --> 00:31:13.172
<i>Every doctor in town,</i>

577
00:31:13.197 --> 00:31:15.361
<i>but no amount of scans</i>

578
00:31:15.386 --> 00:31:17.133
<i>or tests found a thing,</i>

579
00:31:17.158 --> 00:31:18.611
<i>but...</i>

580
00:31:18.636 --> 00:31:19.858
<i>I can't shake it,</i>

581
00:31:19.900 --> 00:31:23.025
<i>this weight hanging on me.</i>

582
00:31:23.066 --> 00:31:26.137
<i>It's the visions
that really get me.</i>


583
00:31:26.162 --> 00:31:27.579
You also get visions?

584
00:31:27.604 --> 00:31:28.750
<i>Yes, ma'am.</i>

585
00:31:28.775 --> 00:31:31.108
<i>I call it hijacking.</i>

586
00:31:31.133 --> 00:31:34.156
<i>It feels violent. Invasive.</i>

587
00:31:34.181 --> 00:31:36.158
And what do you see?

588
00:31:36.183 --> 00:31:38.703
<i>Well, it's hard to know
exactly when the vision starts</i>


589
00:31:38.728 --> 00:31:42.191
<i>and reality ends.</i>

590
00:31:42.233 --> 00:31:44.062
<i>It's always when
I'm coming to work.</i>


591
00:31:44.087 --> 00:31:46.441
<i>I'm a financial consultant.</i>

592
00:31:46.483 --> 00:31:49.962
<i>Work in one of the
tallest buildings in Ohio.</i>


593
00:31:49.987 --> 00:31:54.362
<i>I know I'm having this vision
because there's a smell.</i>


594
00:31:54.608 --> 00:31:57.355
<i>It's really weird, but
I can really smell it.</i>


595
00:31:57.380 --> 00:31:59.833
What kind of smell?

596
00:31:59.858 --> 00:32:03.858
<i>Um... best way I can
describe it is rotting meat,</i>


597
00:32:03.900 --> 00:32:07.984
<i>like, old, rancid meat
left out in the sun.</i>


598
00:32:11.191 --> 00:32:13.150
<i>As I walk through my floor,</i>

599
00:32:13.191 --> 00:32:17.312
<i>I realize the whole
office is empty.</i>


600
00:32:17.337 --> 00:32:18.816
<i>I'm spooked.</i>

601
00:32:18.858 --> 00:32:24.509
<i>It's just silent.
It's deathly silent.</i>


602
00:32:24.534 --> 00:32:28.375
<i>Except for this wind whistling
straight through the building.</i>


603
00:32:31.112 --> 00:32:34.875
<i>So I keep walking straight
into my beautiful office.</i>


604
00:32:34.900 --> 00:32:38.603
<i>View of the city, all
those streets below.</i>


605
00:32:38.628 --> 00:32:41.483
<i>There's a window, closed
tight but still this wind,</i>


606
00:32:41.508 --> 00:32:44.650
<i>and I know... don't ask
me how, but I just...</i>


607
00:32:44.691 --> 00:32:47.900
<i>I know the only
thing that could stop</i>


608
00:32:47.941 --> 00:32:50.823
<i>this awful, empty feeling
would be to keep walking</i>


609
00:32:50.848 --> 00:32:52.765
<i>straight out that window.</i>

610
00:32:55.064 --> 00:32:57.150
<i>So that's what I do.</i>

611
00:32:57.191 --> 00:32:58.730
<i>And just before
I hit the ground,</i>


612
00:32:58.755 --> 00:33:00.047
<i>I wake up and I'm at work.</i>

613
00:33:02.150 --> 00:33:04.400
<i>And people tell me
that I have been</i>


614
00:33:04.431 --> 00:33:06.733
<i>walking through the
building the whole time,</i>


615
00:33:06.775 --> 00:33:08.900
<i>talking to folks like
there is nothing wrong,</i>


616
00:33:08.941 --> 00:33:11.108
<i>as though none of
it ever happened.</i>


617
00:33:11.150 --> 00:33:14.400
<i>Like I just dreamt all of it up.</i>

618
00:33:14.441 --> 00:33:16.816
<i>And that's when
I stopped eating.</i>


619
00:33:16.858 --> 00:33:19.900
<i>That's when I received
the black rock.</i>


620
00:33:19.941 --> 00:33:22.330
Tell me about it.

621
00:33:23.753 --> 00:33:26.875
<i>This rock ain't like anything
I've ever seen or felt.</i>


622
00:33:26.900 --> 00:33:30.666
<i>It's more than just an object.</i>

623
00:33:31.113 --> 00:33:34.066
<i>It wants something from me.</i>

624
00:33:34.785 --> 00:33:37.400
Do you still have it?

625
00:33:37.441 --> 00:33:40.483
<i>It's sitting right
in front of me.</i>


626
00:33:40.525 --> 00:33:44.150
Could you, uh, could you
send me a photograph of it?


627
00:33:44.667 --> 00:33:46.637
<i>I don't see why not.</i>

628
00:33:47.910 --> 00:33:50.893
Have you ever tried
to get rid of it?


629
00:33:50.918 --> 00:33:52.775
Destroy it?

630
00:33:52.816 --> 00:33:55.449
<i>Yeah, of course, I've
thought about it,</i>


631
00:33:55.474 --> 00:33:57.362
<i>smashing the thing.</i>

632
00:33:57.785 --> 00:34:00.885
<i>Yeah. Anything to make it stop.</i>

633
00:34:00.910 --> 00:34:03.033
<i>But then, this</i>

634
00:34:03.058 --> 00:34:05.660
<i>this feeling hits me, and...</i>

635
00:34:08.934 --> 00:34:10.354
<i>It's trying to tell me something</i>

636
00:34:10.379 --> 00:34:11.784
<i>and I gotta listen.</i>

637
00:34:14.090 --> 00:34:17.191
What's it telling you?

638
00:34:17.233 --> 00:34:21.738
<i>Something awful is
coming, truly...</i>


639
00:34:23.528 --> 00:34:26.191
<i>Oh, I'm sorry, sorry.</i>

640
00:34:26.233 --> 00:34:30.441
<i>I'm sorry, I, uh, I
hope this is helpful.</i>


641
00:34:31.067 --> 00:34:33.096
How did you find it, Laura?

642
00:34:33.121 --> 00:34:34.858
<i>What do you mean?</i>

643
00:34:35.472 --> 00:34:37.284
Well, you say you received it,

644
00:34:37.309 --> 00:34:39.143
but how?

645
00:34:39.168 --> 00:34:42.260
Did it just turn up one day?

646
00:34:42.285 --> 00:34:45.066
Was it in a package
or something?


647
00:34:45.108 --> 00:34:48.629
<i>Uh, look, I... I
can't tell you that,</i>


648
00:34:48.654 --> 00:34:52.300
<i>it was just... it was
there, that's all.</i>


649
00:34:52.816 --> 00:34:55.108
I need you to tell me
everything, Laura, I...


650
00:34:55.150 --> 00:34:57.400
I need to be able to
verify your story.


651
00:34:57.441 --> 00:34:59.112
<i>Uh, you think I'm
making this up?</i>


652
00:34:59.137 --> 00:35:01.441
No, of course not.

653
00:35:01.483 --> 00:35:03.792
But it is important that I
have all the information.


654
00:35:03.817 --> 00:35:06.778
<i>Look, maybe you
can't understand,</i>


655
00:35:06.803 --> 00:35:10.007
<i>but there are some things
that I just can't talk about.</i>


656
00:35:10.032 --> 00:35:11.590
<i>Simple as that.</i>

657
00:35:13.004 --> 00:35:15.025
You can't or you won't, Laura?

658
00:35:15.066 --> 00:35:17.191
<i>Look, I... I have
told you what I can.</i>


659
00:35:17.233 --> 00:35:19.691
<i>Uh, my kids are coming
back from school</i>


660
00:35:19.733 --> 00:35:21.838
<i>and I just gotta go,
so I'm... I'm sorry...</i>


661
00:35:21.863 --> 00:35:24.400
- No, please, Laura.
<i>- Please!</i>


662
00:35:24.441 --> 00:35:26.650
<i>Please! Please just help me.</i>

663
00:35:26.691 --> 00:35:28.128
<i>I can't keep living
like this, please!</i>


664
00:35:28.153 --> 00:35:29.025
Laura!

665
00:35:52.140 --> 00:35:54.121
<i>This is Floramae King.</i>

666
00:35:54.146 --> 00:35:56.833
<i>My daughter Paula just
played me your podcast.</i>


667
00:35:56.858 --> 00:35:59.668
<i>You changed my words
around, and I...</i>


668
00:35:59.693 --> 00:36:02.901
<i>I don't want that family to
hear me say those things.</i>


669
00:36:02.926 --> 00:36:05.343
<i>They were so angry last
time.- My friend refuses</i>


670
00:36:05.368 --> 00:36:08.340
<i>to tell me where it came
from, like he is scared.</i>


671
00:36:08.365 --> 00:36:11.365
<i>The last we heard was
she's in a secure facility.</i>


672
00:36:11.390 --> 00:36:13.682
<i>Aliens are comin', and
they want to destroy...</i>


673
00:36:13.707 --> 00:36:16.062
<i>Eight months after, we
received this black rock.</i>


674
00:36:16.087 --> 00:36:17.396
<i>The operations manager
in Dubai received one...</i>


675
00:36:17.441 --> 00:36:18.983
<i>My father believed the stone</i>

676
00:36:19.025 --> 00:36:20.674
<i>was an omen sent from the dead.</i>

677
00:36:20.699 --> 00:36:22.660
<i>He won't tell me how he got it.</i>

678
00:36:22.685 --> 00:36:24.792
<i>We are all scared that
we will get one next.</i>


679
00:36:24.817 --> 00:36:28.263
<i>But why? What is this
rock? What does it want?</i>


680
00:36:28.288 --> 00:36:31.215
<i>Every civilization has
an end, and this is ours!</i>


681
00:36:31.240 --> 00:36:33.043
<i>Are you listening to me?</i>

682
00:36:37.805 --> 00:36:40.638
<i>You have to stop this podcast!</i>

683
00:36:40.663 --> 00:36:42.555
<i>When did your grandfather
receive the brick?</i>


684
00:36:42.580 --> 00:36:44.876
<i>You're making it worse.
The brick is spreading.</i>


685
00:36:44.900 --> 00:36:46.650
<i>We shouldn't be
talking about this.</i>


686
00:36:46.691 --> 00:36:49.192
<i>Just a couple more minutes.</i>

687
00:36:49.217 --> 00:36:53.690
<i>Did your grandfather ever
tell you how he received it</i>


688
00:36:53.715 --> 00:36:56.659
<i>or if someone gave it to him?</i>

689
00:36:56.684 --> 00:36:58.981
<i>He refused.</i>

690
00:36:59.006 --> 00:37:02.257
<i>He said we wouldn't believe
it. That he was ashamed.</i>


691
00:37:02.282 --> 00:37:05.551
<i>Other people talk
about getting visions.</i>


692
00:37:05.576 --> 00:37:09.375
<i>Has your grandfather ever
experienced anything like that?</i>


693
00:37:09.400 --> 00:37:12.331
<i>I told him I
wouldn't tell anyone.</i>


694
00:37:12.356 --> 00:37:14.400
<i>I only called to warn you!</i>

695
00:37:14.441 --> 00:37:17.525
I'm trying to understand
what these bricks are,


696
00:37:17.566 --> 00:37:21.699
but you have to tell
me what has happened.


697
00:37:24.557 --> 00:37:26.174
Let me help you.

698
00:37:26.199 --> 00:37:28.191
We can speak off the record.

699
00:37:30.685 --> 00:37:32.647
<i>You won't record us?</i>

700
00:37:34.729 --> 00:37:36.350
I won't record us.

701
00:37:37.944 --> 00:37:40.691
<i>Okay... okay.</i>

702
00:37:40.733 --> 00:37:44.005
<i>We can talk, but not for long.</i>

703
00:37:47.816 --> 00:37:52.775
<i>My grandfather has been
having these visions, yes?</i>


704
00:37:56.104 --> 00:37:57.810
<i>Many years ago,</i>

705
00:37:57.835 --> 00:38:00.066
<i>my grandfather had an affair</i>

706
00:38:00.108 --> 00:38:03.638
<i>and fathered a son
with another woman.</i>


707
00:38:03.663 --> 00:38:05.669
<i>We never knew.</i>

708
00:38:05.694 --> 00:38:07.941
<i>Years later,</i>

709
00:38:07.983 --> 00:38:11.691
<i>he sees this woman
at a shopping mall.</i>


710
00:38:11.733 --> 00:38:17.150
<i>She has her son,
his son, with her.</i>


711
00:38:17.191 --> 00:38:21.015
<i>But the boy looks at
him like a stranger.</i>


712
00:38:22.210 --> 00:38:24.341
<i>He never saw them again.</i>

713
00:38:27.275 --> 00:38:30.483
<i>One night a few months ago,</i>

714
00:38:30.525 --> 00:38:34.858
<i>I found my grandfather
in the dining room alone.</i>


715
00:38:34.900 --> 00:38:40.108
<i>I have never seen him
look so frightened.</i>


716
00:38:40.150 --> 00:38:42.858
<i>He was whispering to
an empty chair, saying,</i>


717
00:38:42.900 --> 00:38:49.483
<i>"I am sorry, I am sorry,"
over and over again.</i>


718
00:38:50.025 --> 00:38:53.900
<i>He told me that for
weeks, every night,</i>


719
00:38:53.941 --> 00:38:57.941
<i>a young boy had sat
eating dinner with us.</i>


720
00:38:57.983 --> 00:39:01.265
<i>Only my grandfather
could see him.</i>


721
00:39:02.358 --> 00:39:06.054
<i>He believed it was
his son haunting him.</i>


722
00:39:09.025 --> 00:39:13.419
<i>A few weeks ago, the
boy stopped coming.</i>


723
00:39:13.444 --> 00:39:15.650
<i>The brick is gone.</i>

724
00:39:15.691 --> 00:39:21.538
<i>But my grandfather has changed.</i>

725
00:39:23.303 --> 00:39:29.803
<i>Like he has been replaced
with something else.</i>


726
00:39:34.280 --> 00:39:35.608
<i>Hello?</i>

727
00:39:35.650 --> 00:39:38.171
<i>Are you there? Hello?</i>

728
00:39:38.196 --> 00:39:40.350
Um... yes, sorry.

729
00:39:41.900 --> 00:39:44.302
You said your grandfather's
brick has disappeared.


730
00:39:44.327 --> 00:39:46.400
<i>I told you, it's gone.</i>

731
00:39:46.441 --> 00:39:49.191
<i>And ever since, he's different.</i>

732
00:39:49.233 --> 00:39:51.099
Different how?

733
00:39:51.124 --> 00:39:54.052
<i>There's nothing behind his eyes.</i>

734
00:39:54.077 --> 00:39:56.941
<i>- No soul.</i>
- Right.


735
00:39:56.983 --> 00:39:59.400
<i>And now, my father
has been getting sick.</i>


736
00:39:59.425 --> 00:40:01.716
<i>The same sick as my grandfather.</i>

737
00:40:01.741 --> 00:40:03.691
<i>He won't eat. 
Can't work.</i>

738
00:40:03.733 --> 00:40:05.732
<i>I'm so scared he's
going to receive</i>


739
00:40:05.757 --> 00:40:07.816
<i>this object as well.</i>

740
00:40:07.858 --> 00:40:10.127
Is he also getting visions?

741
00:40:10.152 --> 00:40:12.505
<i>Yes. He is terrified.</i>

742
00:40:12.530 --> 00:40:13.966
<i>He knows what is coming.</i>

743
00:40:13.991 --> 00:40:15.233
<i>I could be next.</i>

744
00:40:15.275 --> 00:40:17.566
<i>Any of us could be next.</i>

745
00:40:17.608 --> 00:40:19.740
<i>It is spreading like a disease</i>

746
00:40:19.765 --> 00:40:22.858
<i>or an invasion.</i>

747
00:40:22.883 --> 00:40:27.054
<i>This is why it is dangerous
to keep doing the podcast.</i>


748
00:40:27.079 --> 00:40:28.991
<i>Don't you understand?</i>

749
00:40:30.647 --> 00:40:32.733
<i>Nobody listens to me.</i>

750
00:40:32.775 --> 00:40:34.505
<i>I go to the police,
to the doctors,</i>


751
00:40:34.530 --> 00:40:36.275
<i>to the government,</i>

752
00:40:36.316 --> 00:40:39.554
<i>but they all tell me I'm crazy.</i>

753
00:40:41.110 --> 00:40:44.708
<i>Do you think I am crazy?</i>

754
00:40:45.631 --> 00:40:47.827
No, I don't.

755
00:40:48.691 --> 00:40:53.483
I think you're
frightened and confused,


756
00:40:53.525 --> 00:40:55.608
and something is happening
that you don't understand,


757
00:40:55.633 --> 00:41:00.561
and you and your family
deserve the truth.


758
00:41:02.690 --> 00:41:04.608
<i>Thank you.</i>

759
00:41:05.671 --> 00:41:08.066
<i>But I'm warning you.</i>

760
00:41:08.108 --> 00:41:11.021
<i>You have to stop
what you're doing.</i>


761
00:41:11.046 --> 00:41:12.566
<i>You are in danger.</i>

762
00:41:12.608 --> 00:41:14.224
<i>What if the brick
comes after you?</i>


763
00:41:14.249 --> 00:41:15.566
I really don't think...

764
00:41:15.608 --> 00:41:17.650
<i>Please, end this now.</i>

765
00:41:17.691 --> 00:41:20.390
<i>That is all I am asking.</i>

766
00:42:41.878 --> 00:42:45.669
Mm-mm! Who's a lucky boy, Ian?

767
00:42:45.694 --> 00:42:48.382
Yeah, go on, go on!

768
00:42:49.420 --> 00:42:50.765
Eat it, Ian.

769
00:44:01.446 --> 00:44:05.071
<i>Hi. You've reached Scott
Evans, Linguistics, at MIT.</i>

<i>Leave a message and I'll
get back to you. Cheers.</i>

<i>Hey.</i>

00:44:09.358 --> 00:44:13.400
<i>Remember my crazy
little brick story?</i>


773
00:44:13.441 --> 00:44:17.671
<i>Well, it's blowing up, and, uh,</i>

774
00:44:17.696 --> 00:44:21.421
<i>I've got some scans I would
like you to take a look at.</i>


775
00:44:23.108 --> 00:44:27.900
It's, uh... it's pretty
wild, so, open mind, okay?


776
00:44:28.699 --> 00:44:31.358
Let me know. Speak soon.

777
00:45:08.925 --> 00:45:13.169
<i>Okay. What the hell
am I looking at?</i>


778
00:45:13.194 --> 00:45:14.944
<i>Where did you get these from?</i>

779
00:45:14.969 --> 00:45:16.427
<i>An art collector.</i>

780
00:45:16.452 --> 00:45:18.382
<i>What do you think?</i>

781
00:45:18.733 --> 00:45:20.669
<i>It's not a language
I recognize.</i>


782
00:45:20.694 --> 00:45:22.538
<i>And?</i>

783
00:45:22.563 --> 00:45:25.294
<i>Linguistically
speaking, they're quite</i>


784
00:45:25.319 --> 00:45:26.816
<i>unique.</i>

785
00:45:26.858 --> 00:45:28.983
- <i>But?</i>
<i>- Listen.</i>


786
00:45:29.025 --> 00:45:31.191
<i>Are you quite sure your
man the art collector...</i>


787
00:45:31.233 --> 00:45:33.200
<i>Klaus.</i>- <i>Right.</i>

788
00:45:33.225 --> 00:45:35.691
<i>Klaus the art collector.</i>

789
00:45:35.733 --> 00:45:37.865
<i>Are you quite sure
he's not having you on?</i>


790
00:45:37.890 --> 00:45:38.958
<i>What do you mean?</i>

791
00:45:38.983 --> 00:45:41.061
<i>Oh, come on.</i>

792
00:45:41.086 --> 00:45:43.083
<i>It wouldn't be the first time
somebody made something up</i>


793
00:45:43.108 --> 00:45:45.900
<i>for a bit of
notoriety, would it?</i>


794
00:45:45.941 --> 00:45:48.733
<i>Have you even seen
one of these bricks?</i>


795
00:45:48.775 --> 00:45:52.150
Not personally, but
I've got photographs.


796
00:45:52.191 --> 00:45:54.358
<i>Right.</i>

797
00:45:54.860 --> 00:45:56.968
These people...

798
00:45:59.275 --> 00:46:03.450
I believe they've all had
an experience of some kind


799
00:46:03.475 --> 00:46:06.291
- related to this artifact.
<i>- Mm-hm.</i>


800
00:46:06.316 --> 00:46:12.255
Whether it's an object from
Earth or somewhere else...


801
00:46:12.280 --> 00:46:13.816
<i>You're not serious! Listen...</i>

802
00:46:13.858 --> 00:46:16.247
I also found an article
about a phenomenon


803
00:46:16.272 --> 00:46:18.400
that matches these bricks.

804
00:46:18.441 --> 00:46:21.115
I think the UK government
was investigating this


805
00:46:21.140 --> 00:46:24.525
as far back as the '80s, Scott.

806
00:46:24.566 --> 00:46:26.911
<i>One article is hardly a
government conspiracy.</i>


807
00:46:26.936 --> 00:46:29.441
This is a good story.

808
00:46:29.483 --> 00:46:31.293
Could you just tell
me about the language


809
00:46:31.318 --> 00:46:34.208
on the scans, please?

810
00:46:34.233 --> 00:46:36.316
<i>It could be some sort of complex</i>

811
00:46:36.358 --> 00:46:38.218
<i>semantographic alphabet,</i>

812
00:46:38.243 --> 00:46:42.326
<i>but it feels untethered
from any language I know of.</i>


813
00:46:42.483 --> 00:46:45.255
What, like a completely
unknown language?


814
00:46:45.280 --> 00:46:46.983
<i>Not quite.</i>

815
00:46:47.025 --> 00:46:49.983
<i>You say each scan is different.</i>

816
00:46:50.025 --> 00:46:53.441
Yeah. Well, I mean, clearly
the same type of symbols,


817
00:46:53.483 --> 00:46:56.624
but each brick's
symbols are unique.


818
00:46:57.316 --> 00:47:00.272
On the surface, it
seems really random,


819
00:47:00.297 --> 00:47:04.093
but one theory is that
the symbols are related


820
00:47:04.118 --> 00:47:07.022
to the person who received it.

821
00:47:07.047 --> 00:47:10.775
Like a personal data set.

822
00:47:10.816 --> 00:47:13.775
Klaus seemed to think so. He...

823
00:47:13.816 --> 00:47:16.710
He recognized symbols that
meant something to him


824
00:47:16.735 --> 00:47:18.358
personally.

825
00:47:18.400 --> 00:47:20.275
At the time, I
thought he was nuts,


826
00:47:20.316 --> 00:47:21.983
- but now, I might actually...
<i>- Hang on.</i>


827
00:47:22.025 --> 00:47:24.149
<i>Even if this is what
you think it is,</i>


828
00:47:24.174 --> 00:47:27.608
<i>some kind of alien language
or data set or whatever,</i>


829
00:47:27.650 --> 00:47:29.691
<i>no university would touch it</i>

830
00:47:29.733 --> 00:47:32.274
<i>without some sort of
authenticity test.</i>


831
00:47:32.299 --> 00:47:35.452
<i>Can you imagine the amount of
conlangs we see every year?</i>


832
00:47:38.608 --> 00:47:41.516
<i>I don't want you to make
an idiot of yourself.</i>


833
00:47:41.541 --> 00:47:43.444
<i>What they did to you at The
Journal was rubbish, but...</i>


834
00:47:43.469 --> 00:47:46.186
This has got nothing
to do with that.


835
00:47:46.211 --> 00:47:47.733
<i>No?</i>

836
00:47:47.775 --> 00:47:49.850
This is nothing
like David Langley.


837
00:47:49.875 --> 00:47:50.858
<i>Isn't it?</i>

838
00:47:50.900 --> 00:47:52.679
<i>You believed he was guilty.</i>

839
00:47:52.704 --> 00:47:55.586
He was guilty. 
He's a criminal.

840
00:47:55.611 --> 00:47:57.542
<i>But you didn't background-check
your source properly</i>


841
00:47:57.566 --> 00:47:59.825
<i>because you wanted
to believe it,</i>


842
00:47:59.850 --> 00:48:01.297
<i>didn't you?</i>

843
00:48:02.816 --> 00:48:06.150
<i>You're right, Langley
probably was guilty.</i>


844
00:48:06.191 --> 00:48:08.163
<i>But you didn't have the
evidence to prove it.</i>


845
00:48:09.566 --> 00:48:11.900
The public needed
to know the truth.


846
00:48:11.941 --> 00:48:14.243
<i>And you needed to be
the one who told them.</i>


847
00:48:17.157 --> 00:48:20.566
<i>You know how much I respect you.</i>

848
00:48:21.008 --> 00:48:23.525
<i>But all I'm saying...</i>

849
00:48:23.805 --> 00:48:26.275
<i>Do you really believe this,</i>

850
00:48:26.316 --> 00:48:28.788
<i>or do you just
want to believe it?</i>


851
00:49:04.525 --> 00:49:05.811
<i>Knock-knock.</i>

852
00:50:00.110 --> 00:50:01.604

I'm ringing because
I need to know


899
00:53:44.731 --> 00:53:46.315
if you're fucking with me.

900

<i>I'm sorry?</i>

You seem very upset.</i>

00:53:49.856 --> 00:53:51.650
Yes, I'm very upset.

903
00:53:51.691 --> 00:53:54.191
I want to know why I
just received a symbol


904
00:53:54.233 --> 00:53:58.150
from your volumetric
scan in a fucking package


905
00:53:58.191 --> 00:54:00.706
accompanying a video of
me as a nine-year-old


906
00:54:00.731 --> 00:54:03.229
where I say I received
a black brick,


907
00:54:03.254 --> 00:54:06.924
which makes me think
you're fuckin' around,


908
00:54:06.949 --> 00:54:09.066
trying to spook me
for some reason.

<i>I don't know what
you're talking about.</i>


910
00:54:10.731 --> 00:54:12.528
<i>A symbol? You have a brick?</i>

911
00:54:12.553 --> 00:54:14.706
You can't do this to me.

912
00:54:14.731 --> 00:54:17.483
I will call the cops.

913
00:54:17.525 --> 00:54:20.150

<i>- I'm doing nothing.</i>

<i>I'm at the playground

<i>I'm telling you the truth.</i>

919
00:54:35.754 --> 00:54:37.090
<i>not so crazy, huh?</i>

920
00:54:37.115 --> 00:54:38.960
Be straight with me.
Are these bricks real?


921
00:54:38.985 --> 00:54:39.985
<i>Yes.</i>

00:54:52.192 --> 00:54:54.503
<i>You ask what is the difference</i>

926
00:54:54.528 --> 00:54:57.573
<i>between these
visions and reality.</i>


927
00:54:57.598 --> 00:55:00.275
<i>I really don't know.</i>

928
00:55:00.316 --> 00:55:03.393
<i>Depending on which
way you look at it,</i>


929
00:55:03.418 --> 00:55:05.858
<i>perhaps nothing.</i>

930
00:55:05.900 --> 00:55:10.223
Klaus, I want you to
show me the brick.


931
00:55:11.949 --> 00:55:13.775
Prove to me they're real.

932
00:55:13.816 --> 00:55:16.456
<i>Okay. Tomorrow.
I can go to my...</i>


933
00:55:16.481 --> 00:55:20.010
No. Not tomorrow, now.

934
00:55:20.035 --> 00:55:21.956
<i>I told you, 
I'm at a playground.</i>

935
00:55:21.981 --> 00:55:23.301
<i>My granddaughter just...</i>

936
00:55:23.326 --> 00:55:25.293
I'm sure the authorities
would be interested


937
00:55:25.318 --> 00:55:27.340
in checking the
provenance certificates


938
00:55:27.365 --> 00:55:29.448
of the artwork you sell.

939
00:55:29.473 --> 00:55:31.275
I can make the call

940
00:55:31.316 --> 00:55:34.753
and see just how
interested they might be.


941
00:55:34.778 --> 00:55:36.079
<i>Are you threatening me?</i>

942
00:55:36.104 --> 00:55:37.676
Yes, I am.

943
00:55:43.353 --> 00:55:46.113
You just have to help
me, Klaus, please.


944
00:55:48.195 --> 00:55:50.153
<i>Give me 30 minutes.</i>

945
00:56:14.657 --> 00:56:16.073
Hello?

946
00:56:18.783 --> 00:56:21.995
If anyone's out
there, I'm not scared.


947
00:56:52.935 --> 00:56:55.278
Eat.

948
00:56:56.278 --> 00:56:58.458
Eat. Come on, Ian.

949
00:56:58.483 --> 00:57:01.863
What is wrong with
you, stupid turtle?


950
00:57:16.354 --> 00:57:18.729
Klaus, what the fuck
took you so long?


951
00:57:18.754 --> 00:57:22.057
<i>I'm here in my vault.</i>

952
00:57:22.082 --> 00:57:23.409
- Just wait.
<i>- I haven't</i>


953
00:57:23.434 --> 00:57:25.064
<i>seen the brick for so long,</i>

954
00:57:25.089 --> 00:57:26.190
<i>but it looks how I remember.</i>

955
00:57:26.215 --> 00:57:28.233
Hold on, I need to record this.

956
00:57:28.275 --> 00:57:32.628
<i>After all these years,
it feels the same.</i>


957
00:57:32.653 --> 00:57:34.479
<i>That awful feeling.</i>

958
00:57:34.504 --> 00:57:36.292
You said you had a few bricks.

959
00:57:36.317 --> 00:57:38.316
You've got... you've got dozens.

960
00:57:38.358 --> 00:57:41.137
<i>I spent my life collecting,
trying to understand,</i>


961
00:57:41.162 --> 00:57:43.410
<i>but none of it matters now.</i>

962
00:57:43.442 --> 00:57:46.393
<i>My brother is here.</i>

963
00:57:49.394 --> 00:57:50.761
What?

964
00:57:50.786 --> 00:57:52.120
You can see him?

965
00:57:52.145 --> 00:57:54.317
<i>I can sense him.</i>

966
00:57:54.551 --> 00:57:56.566
<i>He's here.</i>

967
00:57:56.608 --> 00:58:00.690
<i>And this sound, all I
can hear is this sound.</i>


968
00:58:02.246 --> 00:58:04.206
Klaus, I can't see.

969
00:58:04.231 --> 00:58:06.816
You need to show me
what is happening.


970
00:58:06.858 --> 00:58:09.566
<i>Please, stop, stop, stop!</i>

971
00:58:09.608 --> 00:58:11.900
What are you doing?

972
00:58:11.941 --> 00:58:14.197
<i>It has to end. 
Yes, it must.</i>

973
00:58:14.222 --> 00:58:16.471
Klaus, can... can you hear me?

974
00:58:16.496 --> 00:58:18.705
Pick up the phone.

975
00:58:34.043 --> 00:58:35.710
Klaus.

976
00:58:35.735 --> 00:58:37.699
<i>There's nothing...</i>

977
00:58:41.259 --> 00:58:43.217
<i>Oh my god.</i>

978
00:58:48.059 --> 00:58:49.150
Fuck.

979
00:58:54.099 --> 00:58:55.753
<i>The number you have dialed</i>

980
00:58:55.778 --> 00:58:57.275
<i>is currently unavailable.</i>

981
00:58:57.316 --> 00:59:01.025
<i>Please leave a

982
00:59:01.066 --> 00:59:03.733

<i>And this sound, all I

986
00:59:15.025 --> 00:59:18.016
<i>Welcome to Beyond Believable.</i>

987
00:59:19.441 --> 00:59:21.983
<i>I believe my life is in danger.</i>

988
00:59:22.025 --> 00:59:24.345
<i>But why? What is this
rock? What does it want?</i>


989
00:59:24.370 --> 00:59:27.045
<i>Trying to understand, but
none of that matters now.</i>


990
00:59:27.070 --> 00:59:28.170
<i>Are you listening to me?</i>

991
00:59:28.195 --> 00:59:29.351
<i>What happened</i>

992
00:59:29.376 --> 00:59:31.320
<i>in Klaus Lang's art vault?</i>

993
00:59:31.345 --> 00:59:32.587
<i>Every civilization has...</i>

994
00:59:32.612 --> 00:59:34.626
<i>Thank you, thank you!</i>

995
00:59:34.651 --> 00:59:37.539
<i>And was I the last person
to speak to him alive?</i>


996
00:59:37.564 --> 00:59:38.689
<i>For fuck's sake.</i>

997
00:59:38.714 --> 00:59:40.959
<i>But it feels untethered
from any language I know of.</i>


998
00:59:40.983 --> 00:59:43.233
<i>I only called to warn you.</i>

999
00:59:43.275 --> 00:59:45.101
<i>Unlike anything I've
ever seen before.</i>


1000
00:59:46.483 --> 00:59:49.648
I have to continue this podcast.

1001
00:59:49.673 --> 00:59:51.064
I have to find the truth.

1002
00:59:51.089 --> 00:59:53.681
<i>All I can hear is this sound.</i>

1003
00:59:53.706 --> 00:59:58.541
<i>But my grandfather
has changed.</i>


1004
00:59:58.566 --> 01:00:02.212
<i>Something terrible is coming.</i>

1005
01:00:02.237 --> 01:00:03.586
<i>Something...</i>

1006
01:00:03.611 --> 01:00:05.281
<i>But it was me it chose.</i>

1007
01:00:05.306 --> 01:00:07.484
<i>Unbelievable.</i>

1008
01:00:18.734 --> 01:00:19.867
Dad?

1009
01:00:19.892 --> 01:00:22.139
<i>Ah, sorry, no.</i>

1010
01:00:22.164 --> 01:00:23.250
<i>Is it too early?</i>

1011
01:00:23.275 --> 01:00:24.481
Who is this?

1012
01:00:24.506 --> 01:00:26.173
<i>Shiloh Lowden.</i>

1013
01:00:27.361 --> 01:00:29.859
<i>You wanted to chat about
my article from yonks ago.</i>


1014
01:00:29.884 --> 01:00:31.650
Yeah, um...

1015
01:00:31.691 --> 01:00:34.531
Yeah, thank you, uh,
for calling me back.


1016
01:00:34.556 --> 01:00:36.150
Um...

1017
01:00:36.191 --> 01:00:39.695
Sorry, I've just had a
pretty weird couple of days.


1018
01:00:39.720 --> 01:00:41.691
<i>I can imagine.</i>

1019
01:00:41.733 --> 01:00:43.867
<i>I listened to your last episode.</i>

1020
01:00:43.892 --> 01:00:46.375
You listen to my podcast?

1021
01:00:47.118 --> 01:00:48.868
<i>I did my research.</i>

1022
01:00:49.174 --> 01:00:50.133
Yeah, um...

1023
01:00:51.017 --> 01:00:51.983
Right.

1024
01:00:52.025 --> 01:00:55.023
Then you would know that I think

1025
01:00:55.048 --> 01:00:57.859
what you wrote back in 1988

1026
01:00:57.884 --> 01:01:01.181
and what I'm investigating
are the same thing.


1027
01:01:01.206 --> 01:01:06.562
Uh, I'm trying to find patterns
to understand what's happening,


1028
01:01:06.587 --> 01:01:08.422
and I need to know
what you know.


1029
01:01:08.447 --> 01:01:09.775
<i>Right.</i>

1030
01:01:09.816 --> 01:01:12.603
And I thought as a more
experienced journalist,


1031
01:01:12.628 --> 01:01:15.552
you would be prepared
to share with me.


1032
01:01:15.577 --> 01:01:17.797
<i>I'm not certain I know
much that will help you,</i>


1033
01:01:17.822 --> 01:01:19.937
<i>but I'm happy to share.</i>

1034
01:01:19.962 --> 01:01:25.608
Great. Uh, please tell
me about the article.


1035
01:01:25.650 --> 01:01:27.978
<i>Well, back when I was
working at the Chronicle,</i>


1036
01:01:28.003 --> 01:01:30.478
<i>I had a mate who worked in a
hush-hush research department</i>


1037
01:01:30.503 --> 01:01:32.305
<i>at Oxford, government-funded,</i>

1038
01:01:32.330 --> 01:01:34.875
<i>something about international
threats, terrorism.</i>


1039
01:01:34.900 --> 01:01:36.914
<i>I mean, this is back in
the days of Russia, Reagan,</i>


1040
01:01:36.939 --> 01:01:39.025
<i>the decline of the West.</i>

1041
01:01:39.066 --> 01:01:42.025
<i>My paper would kill
for any Cold War scoop.</i>


1042
01:01:42.050 --> 01:01:44.244
<i>So we're out drinking
and I get him to tell me</i>


1043
01:01:44.269 --> 01:01:45.728
<i>about a study his team is doing</i>

1044
01:01:45.753 --> 01:01:47.650
<i>into this neurological illness</i>

1045
01:01:47.691 --> 01:01:49.441
<i>that had been detected
around the world,</i>


1046
01:01:49.483 --> 01:01:52.816
<i>accompanied by these
unexplained objects.</i>


1047
01:01:52.858 --> 01:01:55.691
What did they suspect the
objects were at the time?


1048
01:01:55.733 --> 01:01:57.641
<i>The department had
convinced themselves</i>


1049
01:01:57.666 --> 01:01:58.983
<i>it was the Russians,</i>

1050
01:01:59.025 --> 01:02:01.258
<i>absolutely besotted
with the idea.</i>


1051
01:02:01.283 --> 01:02:02.941
But you didn't think so?

1052
01:02:02.983 --> 01:02:04.984
<i>My mate fed me a
departmental memo</i>


1053
01:02:05.009 --> 01:02:06.691
<i>on the sly, and when I read it,</i>

1054
01:02:06.733 --> 01:02:08.859
<i>I mean, it seemed
completely bonkers.</i>


1055
01:02:08.884 --> 01:02:10.150
Why?

1056
01:02:10.191 --> 01:02:12.358
<i>Well, the study claimed that 70%</i>

1057
01:02:12.400 --> 01:02:14.316
<i>of the affected people
only developed symptoms</i>


1058
01:02:14.358 --> 01:02:16.108
<i>after hearing about this object,</i>

1059
01:02:16.150 --> 01:02:18.858
<i>whatever it was,
from someone else.</i>


1060
01:02:18.900 --> 01:02:22.250
You're talking about
a disease spreading


1061
01:02:22.275 --> 01:02:24.358
through people talking about it?

1062
01:02:24.400 --> 01:02:26.233
<i>It was the main line
of investigation</i>


1063
01:02:26.275 --> 01:02:28.608
<i>the government was
pursuing at the time,</i>


1064
01:02:28.650 --> 01:02:31.941
<i>a kind of viral disease
that traveled through sound.</i>


1065
01:02:31.983 --> 01:02:34.025
<i>Now I know the Russians
had a lot of tools</i>


1066
01:02:34.066 --> 01:02:35.209
<i>at their disposal, but
I don't think even they</i>


1067
01:02:35.233 --> 01:02:36.650
<i>were capable of that.</i>

1068
01:02:36.691 --> 01:02:39.141
Do you still have this memo?

1069
01:02:39.166 --> 01:02:41.816
<i>Sadly, long lost.</i>

1070
01:02:41.858 --> 01:02:44.775
What about your friend,
the department source?


1071
01:02:44.816 --> 01:02:47.492
<i>Posted to some faraway place.</i>

1072
01:02:47.517 --> 01:02:48.608
<i>But...</i>

1073
01:02:48.650 --> 01:02:51.066
<i>I did hear he got sick.</i>

1074
01:02:51.722 --> 01:02:53.805
The same sort of sickness.

1075
01:02:55.834 --> 01:02:57.439
<i>We lost touch.</i>

1076
01:02:58.867 --> 01:03:00.908
Did you ever form an opinion

1077
01:03:00.933 --> 01:03:04.636
about this illness
and these objects?


1078
01:03:05.191 --> 01:03:09.148
<i>To be honest, I didn't
think much of it back then.</i>


1079
01:03:09.173 --> 01:03:12.150
<i>Government jumping at shadows.</i>

1080
01:03:12.191 --> 01:03:16.391
<i>But now I've listened
to your podcast,</i>


1081
01:03:16.416 --> 01:03:19.275
<i>it's clearly compelling stuff.</i>

1082
01:03:19.316 --> 01:03:20.542
<i>But if my article and your story</i>

1083
01:03:20.566 --> 01:03:22.900
<i>are the same thing,</i>

1084
01:03:23.236 --> 01:03:25.233
<i>you need to be careful.</i>

1085
01:03:26.025 --> 01:03:28.102
What do you mean?

1086
01:03:28.127 --> 01:03:31.328
<i>We have a duty to
protect the public.</i>


1087
01:03:33.441 --> 01:03:36.119
<i>Not everything needs
to be published.</i>


1088
01:03:38.072 --> 01:03:39.941
Of course.

1089
01:03:40.119 --> 01:03:41.884
Thank you so much for your time.

1090
01:03:41.909 --> 01:03:43.890
I think I've got
everything I need.


1091
01:03:43.915 --> 01:03:45.126
<i>Good luck.</i>

1092
01:04:07.858 --> 01:04:10.191
<i>Holy shit, one
hell of an episode.</i>


1093
01:04:10.233 --> 01:04:13.025
<i>These numbers are nuts.
Seriously exciting.</i>


1094
01:04:13.050 --> 01:04:14.705
<i>Can't wait for the next
ep. Oh, well, listen!</i>


1095
01:04:14.730 --> 01:04:16.441
<i>And the publicity guys,</i>

1096
01:04:16.483 --> 01:04:18.233
<i>they want to know your schedule</i>

1097
01:04:31.405 --> 01:04:33.835
<i>Hey, I just wanted
to check in.</i>


1098
01:04:33.860 --> 01:04:35.141
<i>Is everything all right?</i>

1099
01:04:35.166 --> 01:04:37.363
Yeah. Why?

1100
01:04:37.388 --> 01:04:39.388
<i>I listened to the new episode,</i>

1101
01:04:39.413 --> 01:04:42.461
<i>and you sounded...
kind of messed up.</i>


1102
01:04:42.486 --> 01:04:44.859
Yeah, that was just, um,

1103
01:04:44.884 --> 01:04:46.875
dramatic license with podcasts.

1104
01:04:46.900 --> 01:04:49.625
Honestly, I am fine.

1105
01:04:49.650 --> 01:04:51.775
<i>- Uh-huh.</i>
- Never been better.


1106
01:04:52.209 --> 01:04:54.041
<i>- Right.</i>
- Mm.


1107
01:04:54.966 --> 01:04:57.258
I'm not gonna stop, Scott.

1108
01:04:57.283 --> 01:05:00.048
This is finally a
real story I've got.


1109
01:05:00.073 --> 01:05:02.517
I've got good numbers and
people are really listening.


1110
01:05:02.542 --> 01:05:04.758
<i>Yeah, look, 
I get that, but...</i>

1111
01:05:04.783 --> 01:05:08.025
There is something going on.

1112
01:05:08.066 --> 01:05:10.858
I feel like this story
could be career-defining.


1113
01:05:10.900 --> 01:05:13.816
<i>It's not that. 
I'm just, uh...</i>

1114
01:05:13.858 --> 01:05:16.358
What? You just think this
story's bullshit, huh?


1115
01:05:16.400 --> 01:05:17.733
<i>Well...</i>

1116
01:05:17.775 --> 01:05:18.733
You know, right from the start,

1117
01:05:18.758 --> 01:05:21.358
you hated this podcast.

1118
01:05:21.400 --> 01:05:23.858
Why... why do you
always do this? Hmm?


1119
01:05:23.900 --> 01:05:26.733
<i>That's unfair. I'm
just worried about you.</i>


1120
01:05:26.775 --> 01:05:28.816
Well, I don't need
your fucking sympathy,


1121
01:05:28.858 --> 01:05:31.400
- I need your support.
<i>- I am trying to.</i>


1122
01:05:31.441 --> 01:05:33.733
<i>But you're making it
really bloody hard.</i>


1123
01:05:33.775 --> 01:05:35.733
<i>Look, all these symbols</i>

1124
01:05:35.775 --> 01:05:37.525
<i>and videos in the
middle of the night,</i>


1125
01:05:37.566 --> 01:05:39.525
<i>have you ever thought
it might be someone</i>


1126
01:05:39.566 --> 01:05:43.162
<i>with a grudge trying
to mess with you, hmm?</i>


1127
01:05:45.212 --> 01:05:46.916
I don't see how.

1128
01:06:35.478 --> 01:06:38.774
"Murder cannot be hid long.

1129
01:06:38.799 --> 01:06:40.882
A man's son may, but

1130
01:06:40.907 --> 01:06:42.812
in the end, the truth will out."

1131
01:06:51.583 --> 01:06:53.625
"Property of FK."

1132
01:06:58.033 --> 01:06:59.441
<i>What do you mean, darling?</i>

1133
01:06:59.483 --> 01:07:01.733
<i>I got a black brick.
It's really pretty.</i>


1134
01:07:01.775 --> 01:07:04.530
<i>A really pretty brick? Wow.</i>

1135
01:07:04.555 --> 01:07:05.930
<i>The birthday...</i>

1136
01:07:50.441 --> 01:07:53.400
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Is this fun for you?


1137
01:07:53.441 --> 01:07:57.400
<i>- Who is this?</i>
- Fucking with me like this.


1138
01:07:57.441 --> 01:08:00.941
<i>No! Uh, is this the lady
who rang about the brick?</i>


1139
01:08:00.983 --> 01:08:03.773
Did you know you worked for
my family when we spoke?


1140
01:08:03.798 --> 01:08:07.233
<i>- What?</i>
- Did you know?


1141
01:08:07.275 --> 01:08:09.900
<i>I don't want to talk to
you. I heard your podcast.</i>


1142
01:08:09.941 --> 01:08:12.483
<i>I didn't say those
things like that.</i>


1143
01:08:12.508 --> 01:08:14.133
<i>You changed what I meant to say.</i>

1144
01:08:14.158 --> 01:08:16.858
What is this, some sort
of fucking revenge plot?


1145
01:08:16.900 --> 01:08:19.275
Payback for my family
taking the brick?


1146
01:08:19.316 --> 01:08:21.437
<i>It was you. 
You're the daughter?</i>

1147
01:08:21.462 --> 01:08:23.900
Yes, I'm the daughter. Jesus.

1148
01:08:23.941 --> 01:08:27.733
You sent me the email.
"The truth will out."


1149
01:08:27.775 --> 01:08:31.525
You're FK, Floramae King.
You wanted me to find you.


1150
01:08:31.566 --> 01:08:33.001
<i>I don't know what
you're talking about...</i>


1151
01:08:33.025 --> 01:08:35.672
- You sent me the video.
<i>- What video?</i>


1152
01:08:35.697 --> 01:08:37.570
The video of my
fucking birthday.


1153
01:08:37.595 --> 01:08:39.242
What other video
am I talking about?


1154
01:08:39.267 --> 01:08:41.726
<i>Stop harassing my mother.</i>

1155
01:08:44.161 --> 01:08:46.953
Is this some kind of sick joke?

1156
01:08:46.978 --> 01:08:49.358
Your family is the
one harassing me


1157
01:08:49.400 --> 01:08:51.900
over something that
happened 20 years ago.


1158
01:08:51.941 --> 01:08:54.626
- Over a fucking brick!
<i>- Why are you calling us?</i>


1159
01:08:54.651 --> 01:08:57.312
- You can't get away with this.
<i>- Get away with what, exactly?</i>


1160
01:08:57.337 --> 01:09:01.226
Emails. Videos. 
Terrorizing me.

1161
01:09:01.251 --> 01:09:02.945
<i>What are you talking about?</i>

1162
01:09:04.233 --> 01:09:06.351
You've made me
look like an idiot.


1163
01:09:06.376 --> 01:09:08.031
It's pathetic.

1164
01:09:08.056 --> 01:09:11.233
And if you don't
stop harassing me,


1165
01:09:11.275 --> 01:09:14.108
- I'm gonna call the cops.
<i>- Be my guest.</i>


1166
01:09:14.150 --> 01:09:15.983
<i>You're the people who
stole our property.</i>


1167
01:09:16.025 --> 01:09:19.140
Oh, you want an apology?
Is that what you want?


1168
01:09:19.165 --> 01:09:21.025
<i>No.</i>

1169
01:09:21.066 --> 01:09:23.168
Well, then tell me what I can
do to make you feel better


1170
01:09:23.193 --> 01:09:25.359
and get you out of my life.

1171
01:09:25.384 --> 01:09:27.650
You want some money?

1172
01:09:27.691 --> 01:09:29.726
<i>That's how you solve
everything, isn't it?</i>


1173
01:09:29.751 --> 01:09:32.039
For God's sake, stop
being so dramatic.


1174
01:09:32.064 --> 01:09:34.275
I've got money, you don't.

1175
01:09:34.316 --> 01:09:37.029
People like you always want
something from people like me.


1176
01:09:37.054 --> 01:09:38.846
I don't like it,
you don't like it,


1177
01:09:38.871 --> 01:09:40.467
but that is the way
the world works.


1178
01:09:44.504 --> 01:09:46.963
<i>You're right.</i>

1179
01:09:46.988 --> 01:09:49.598
<i>It's the way the world works.</i>

1180
01:09:53.941 --> 01:09:55.869
And I was just a kid. I didn't
have anything to do with


1181
01:09:55.894 --> 01:09:57.981
selling that brick.

1182
01:09:58.816 --> 01:10:01.559
<i>You told your parents a lie.</i>

1183
01:10:03.096 --> 01:10:04.846
<i>All those years ago.</i>

1184
01:10:04.871 --> 01:10:07.198
<i>It changed my life.</i>

1185
01:10:07.223 --> 01:10:08.917
What are you talking about?

1186
01:10:08.942 --> 01:10:11.473
<i>Even Mom thought I'd done it.</i>

1187
01:10:11.498 --> 01:10:13.959
<i>She just stood back and let
your family take everything.</i>


1188
01:10:13.983 --> 01:10:15.941
<i>It was her. 
She did it.</i>

1189
01:10:15.983 --> 01:10:20.691
Paula, I really don't know
what you're talking about.


1190
01:10:20.733 --> 01:10:24.535
<i>You sabotaged my life.</i>
-What?

1191
01:10:24.560 --> 01:10:26.604
<i>As soon as your parents
paid for that scholarship,</i>


1192
01:10:26.629 --> 01:10:28.198
<i>you hated me.</i>

1193
01:10:28.223 --> 01:10:31.441
<i>You were jealous. Scared.</i>

1194
01:10:31.483 --> 01:10:35.153
<i>I was better than you,
and your parents liked me.</i>


1195
01:10:35.178 --> 01:10:37.816
<i>You couldn't stand fighting
for their attention.</i>


1196
01:10:37.858 --> 01:10:40.608
<i>You wanted to be special.</i>

1197
01:10:40.650 --> 01:10:42.887
I don't know what
you're talking about.


1198
01:10:45.073 --> 01:10:46.270
<i>You do.</i>

1199
01:10:47.738 --> 01:10:49.588
You need to stop.

1200
01:10:49.613 --> 01:10:52.186
Please stop.

1201
01:10:53.653 --> 01:10:55.987
<i>Stop what?</i>

1202
01:10:59.650 --> 01:11:01.983
Nothing I've done
gives you the right


1203
01:11:02.025 --> 01:11:06.338
to play this game with me.

1204
01:11:06.363 --> 01:11:08.702
You're sick.

1205
01:11:08.727 --> 01:11:10.426
Oh, fucking hell,

1206
01:11:10.451 --> 01:11:13.338
something terrible could happen.

1207
01:11:14.483 --> 01:11:17.418
<i>Something terrible has happened.</i>

1208
01:11:27.112 --> 01:11:28.988
I don't remember.

1209
01:11:30.775 --> 01:11:33.125
<i>I really don't know
what to tell you.</i>


1210
01:11:36.441 --> 01:11:39.191
<i>People like you
feed off the world.</i>


1211
01:11:39.437 --> 01:11:41.562
<i>But one day you won't.</i>

1212
01:11:41.587 --> 01:11:43.528
<i>One day, you'll be gone.</i>

1213
01:11:45.566 --> 01:11:48.336
<i>This is your chance
to put things right.</i>


1214
01:11:48.361 --> 01:11:50.215
<i>To tell the truth.</i>

1215
01:11:53.010 --> 01:11:55.093
<i>Don't call here again.</i>

1216
01:12:17.191 --> 01:12:18.941
<i>Hey, sweetie, I
got your message.</i>


1217
01:12:18.983 --> 01:12:21.762
<i>What on earth are you
talking about? A video?</i>


1218
01:12:21.787 --> 01:12:23.128
I spoke to Floramae.

1219
01:12:23.153 --> 01:12:24.775
<i>Who?</i>

1220
01:12:25.417 --> 01:12:27.829
I know you stole the brick.

1221
01:12:27.854 --> 01:12:28.979
<i>What brick?</i>

1222
01:12:29.004 --> 01:12:31.323
The black brick.

1223
01:12:31.348 --> 01:12:33.237
When I was a kid.

1224
01:12:35.400 --> 01:12:37.608
<i>We don't need to
talk about this.</i>


1225
01:12:38.504 --> 01:12:40.191
Tell me the truth.

1226
01:12:40.216 --> 01:12:42.982
<i>Darling, look, it
was a long time ago.</i>


1227
01:12:43.007 --> 01:12:44.159
<i>It doesn't matter.</i>

1228
01:12:44.184 --> 01:12:47.025
<i>That brick was some art thing.</i>

1229
01:12:47.066 --> 01:12:49.650
<i>The woman didn't know
what she had in her hands.</i>


1230
01:12:49.691 --> 01:12:52.023
- So you stole it?
<i>- We didn't steal anything.</i>


1231
01:12:52.048 --> 01:12:53.548
<i>She was our employee.</i>

1232
01:12:53.573 --> 01:12:55.323
<i>She found it on our property.</i>

1233
01:12:55.348 --> 01:12:56.858
<i>And then on your birthday,</i>

1234
01:12:56.900 --> 01:12:58.667
<i>you picked it up and
thought it was yours.</i>


1235
01:12:58.692 --> 01:12:59.664
<i>A present.</i>

1236
01:12:59.689 --> 01:13:01.484
<i>And you weren't wrong.</i>

1237
01:13:01.509 --> 01:13:02.988
<i>It was ours.</i>

1238
01:13:05.318 --> 01:13:07.401
You fired her, Dad.

1239
01:13:09.584 --> 01:13:12.275
<i>Why are you so upset? Her
crazy kid knifed our furniture.</i>


1240
01:13:12.316 --> 01:13:13.866
<i>If that's not a
fire able offense,</i>


1241
01:13:13.891 --> 01:13:15.442
<i>I don't know what is.</i>

1242
01:13:16.753 --> 01:13:18.753
Why would she do that?

1243
01:13:18.778 --> 01:13:20.276
<i>Who knows?</i>

1244
01:13:20.301 --> 01:13:22.612
<i>Jealousy? Attention?</i>

1245
01:13:22.637 --> 01:13:24.650
How do you know it was her?

1246
01:13:25.113 --> 01:13:27.409
<i>Well, you told us, sweetie.</i>

1247
01:13:29.775 --> 01:13:32.231
<i>You were probably too
young to remember.</i>


1248
01:13:33.108 --> 01:13:34.858
- What...?
<i>- I mean</i>


1249
01:13:34.900 --> 01:13:36.770
<i>it was very brave
of you to speak up</i>


1250
01:13:36.795 --> 01:13:38.341
<i>with a girl so violent.</i>

1251
01:13:38.500 --> 01:13:40.875
<i>You were so scared.</i>

1252
01:13:40.900 --> 01:13:44.650
Um, no, that... that,
uh, that can't be right.


1253
01:13:44.691 --> 01:13:47.238
<i>I did what anyone would
do, and I protected us.</i>


1254
01:13:49.925 --> 01:13:51.300
Tell me what happened.

1255
01:13:52.559 --> 01:13:53.900
<i>Why?</i>

1256
01:13:53.941 --> 01:13:56.348
I want to understand, Dad, it's

1257
01:13:56.373 --> 01:13:58.645
it's really important.

1258
01:14:01.025 --> 01:14:03.775
<i>Floramae's kid was a nightmare.</i>

1259
01:14:03.816 --> 01:14:06.135
<i>As soon as we saw what
she'd done to the furniture,</i>


1260
01:14:06.160 --> 01:14:07.290
<i>we called the police.</i>

1261
01:14:07.315 --> 01:14:08.815
Police?

1262
01:14:08.840 --> 01:14:10.233
She was just a kid.

1263
01:14:10.258 --> 01:14:13.562
<i>It was thousands of
dollars of damage.</i>


1264
01:14:13.587 --> 01:14:15.035
<i>Thousands.</i>

1265
01:14:16.352 --> 01:14:17.964
What did the cops do?

1266
01:14:19.043 --> 01:14:21.433
<i>But this was years ago.</i>
-Dad.

1267
01:14:21.498 --> 01:14:23.684
Tell me what the cops did.

1268
01:14:25.316 --> 01:14:27.233
<i>They charged her
with property damage.</i>


1269
01:14:27.275 --> 01:14:28.858
<i>But because she was so young,</i>

1270
01:14:28.900 --> 01:14:30.650
<i>it was a slap on
the wrist, really.</i>


1271
01:14:30.691 --> 01:14:32.316
<i>She and her mother
had to pay us back</i>


1272
01:14:32.358 --> 01:14:34.233
<i>for the damage done
to the furniture.</i>


1273
01:14:34.275 --> 01:14:35.983
<i>And they didn't have
any money, of course.</i>


1274
01:14:36.025 --> 01:14:38.073
<i>So, when the brick came along...</i>

1275
01:14:38.098 --> 01:14:39.483
You took it.

1276
01:14:39.525 --> 01:14:42.449
<i>It was the only object
of value they had.</i>


1277
01:14:42.474 --> 01:14:44.501
<i>And with violent outbursts
like that, we didn't feel</i>


1278
01:14:44.525 --> 01:14:46.650
<i>we could continue supporting
a music scholarship.</i>


1279
01:14:46.675 --> 01:14:49.967
<i>I mean, what if she... what
if she hurt another student?</i>


1280
01:14:50.025 --> 01:14:53.441
All of this over some furniture?

1281
01:14:53.483 --> 01:14:56.650
<i>You don't understand
how scary it was.</i>


1282
01:14:56.691 --> 01:14:59.207
<i>You were terrified that
she might hurt you.</i>


1283
01:15:01.145 --> 01:15:03.940
<i>And the dining table is
my great-grandfather's.</i>


1284
01:15:03.965 --> 01:15:05.525
<i>It has emotional value.</i>

1285
01:15:05.566 --> 01:15:08.475
<i>We could never really
fix the damage.</i>


1286
01:15:10.066 --> 01:15:12.983
<i>After everything
we gave that kid...</i>


1287
01:15:13.025 --> 01:15:15.632
<i>We were glad to be
rid of both of them.</i>


1288
01:15:17.233 --> 01:15:19.275
<i>Darling, look, 
I don't know why</i>

1289
01:15:19.316 --> 01:15:20.849
<i>you're bringing up
such an unhappy memory.</i>


1290
01:15:20.874 --> 01:15:23.163
<i>Let's just...
let's just move on.</i>


1291
01:15:26.522 --> 01:15:27.748
I think...

1292
01:15:28.418 --> 01:15:29.765
I think you...

1293
01:15:31.435 --> 01:15:33.208
I think you got it wrong.

1294
01:15:34.170 --> 01:15:35.311
<i>What?</i>

1295
01:15:38.589 --> 01:15:41.093
About the furniture.
It wasn't Paula.


1296
01:15:42.233 --> 01:15:44.755
<i>Sweetie, I don't want
to hear about it.</i>


1297
01:15:47.171 --> 01:15:49.066
I'm serious, Dad.

1298
01:15:49.108 --> 01:15:52.816
<i>I said let's not
talk about it, okay?</i>


1299
01:15:52.858 --> 01:15:55.225
<i>No more talk about the past
and this ridiculous brick.</i>


1300
01:15:55.250 --> 01:15:56.616
<i>- Leave it alone.</i>
- Yeah, but I wanna talk


1301
01:15:56.641 --> 01:15:58.200
about it.

1302
01:15:58.358 --> 01:16:01.400
This brick just isn't
some "art thing."


1303
01:16:01.441 --> 01:16:04.344
It's more than that.

1304
01:16:04.369 --> 01:16:06.273
It means something.

1305
01:16:06.298 --> 01:16:08.047
My podcast is helping...

1306
01:16:08.072 --> 01:16:10.316
<i>Are you recording this?!</i>

1307
01:16:10.358 --> 01:16:12.619
<i>Turn that bloody thing off now.</i>

1308
01:16:14.392 --> 01:16:15.726
- Why, Dad?
<i>- You need to stop</i>


1309
01:16:15.751 --> 01:16:18.150
<i>this rubbish, okay?</i>

1310
01:16:18.191 --> 01:16:22.289
<i>You need to heal,
not drag up the past.</i>


1311
01:16:22.314 --> 01:16:24.358
<i>What's the plan?</i>

1312
01:16:24.400 --> 01:16:28.587
<i>Expose your family on
some ridiculous podcast?</i>


1313
01:16:29.542 --> 01:16:30.970
<i>Christ.</i>

1314
01:16:32.744 --> 01:16:34.275
I don't know.

1315
01:16:35.904 --> 01:16:38.469
<i>All families have secrets.</i>

1316
01:16:39.181 --> 01:16:41.583
<i>And they should stay that way.</i>

1317
01:16:42.361 --> 01:16:43.930
<i>Understood?</i>

1318
01:18:03.712 --> 01:18:05.691
<i>Kid was a nightmare.</i>

1319
01:18:05.733 --> 01:18:07.908
<i>As soon as we saw what
she'd done to the furniture,</i>


1320
01:18:07.933 --> 01:18:09.793
<i>we called the police.</i>

1321
01:18:12.449 --> 01:18:14.542
<i>About the furniture.
It wasn't Paula.</i>


1322
01:18:17.108 --> 01:18:19.551
<i>Sweetie, I don't want
to hear about it.</i>


1323
01:24:37.201 --> 01:24:38.201
Hello.

1324
01:25:41.217 --> 01:25:42.488
What are you?

1325
01:25:45.540 --> 01:25:47.722
Can you understand me?

1326
01:25:53.105 --> 01:25:54.688
I wanna know

1327
01:25:54.713 --> 01:25:56.463
why

1328
01:25:56.488 --> 01:25:57.775
you're here,

1329
01:25:58.425 --> 01:26:00.668
and what you want from me.

1330
01:26:03.190 --> 01:26:04.535
From us.

1331
01:27:31.022 --> 01:27:32.189
Shit.

1332
01:27:40.797 --> 01:27:42.297
Please.

1333
01:27:47.885 --> 01:27:49.340
The same.

1334
01:27:54.165 --> 01:27:56.790
Yes, we're the...
we're the same.


1335
01:28:12.863 --> 01:28:14.783
- Are you gonna hurt me?
- Are you gonna hurt me?


1336
01:28:16.756 --> 01:28:18.004
- Shit.
- Shit.


1337
01:30:34.103 --> 01:30:36.187
<i>I wanna tell you a story.</i>

1338
01:30:40.541 --> 01:30:42.983
<i>You might not believe it,</i>

1339
01:30:43.025 --> 01:30:46.892
<i>but that doesn't
mean it isn't true.</i>


1340
01:30:51.738 --> 01:30:53.994
<i>I need to tell it anyway.</i>

1341
01:30:59.826 --> 01:31:02.173
<i>I have a secret.</i>

1342
01:31:05.248 --> 01:31:08.447
<i>I'm the only one
who can share it.</i>


1343
01:31:11.983 --> 01:31:15.439
<i>The only one who is willing.</i>

1344
01:31:18.650 --> 01:31:21.358
<i>And when I tell this story,</i>

1345
01:31:21.634 --> 01:31:24.080
<i>I will change everything.</i>

1346
01:31:36.358 --> 01:31:38.525
<i>All you have to do</i>

1347
01:31:38.550 --> 01:31:40.095
<i>is listen.</i>
