1
00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:37.690
Just straight through there
and to the left, please.


2
00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:58.400
Okay.

3
00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:07.950
Would you like to...

4
00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:27.770
Who's this?

5
00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:29.560
Pardon me?

6
00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:32.040
That's not my father.

7
00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:37.500
Oh, shit, we've taken the wrong one.

8
00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:40.860
Really sorry about that, sir.
We'll go back and get him.


9
00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:42.290
Come on.

10
00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:50.550
Jesus.

11
00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:55.950
FarangSiam thanks you. Enjoy!

12
00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:18.650
They brought the wrong coffin.

13
00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:20.580
You're joking.

14
00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:24.750
Can you believe that?
It's a good job I checked.


15
00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:28.270
Could have been having a service
for some random member of the public.


16
00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:31.264
What kind of Mickey Mouse business are
these people running, anyway?


17
00:05:31.274 --> 00:05:32.074
My God!

18
00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:35.014
There's just so much to worry about,
you know. And Mum's in a state.


19
00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:37.760
Robert's clearly not gonna do anything
to help, assuming he gets here at all.


20
00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:39.320
Plus, this eulogy's just awful.

21
00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:42.960
- I'm sure it's not awful, Daniel.
- Yeah, it is. It is.


22
00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:45.470
Everyone's going to be thinking,
"Why isn't Robert doing the eulogy?


23
00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:47.700
"He's such a great writer."
Maybe I should just let him do it.


24
00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:50.884
You are every bit as good a writer
as your brother, Daniel, if not better.


25
00:05:50.894 --> 00:05:53.780
You've just got to let somebody else
read your novel.


26
00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:56.340
Yeah, everything's going to be okay.

27
00:05:56.420 --> 00:05:59.410
Once the funeral's over,
we've just got to focus


28
00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:03.150
on moving out of here
and starting our own lives properly.


29
00:06:07.230 --> 00:06:10.290
You did call them, didn't you, Daniel?

30
00:06:10.970 --> 00:06:15.570
- You did put the deposit on the flat?
- Yeah, I'll sort it out, I promise.


31
00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:23.450
God, I hate funerals. Don't you?
Really, they're just so depressing.


32
00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:26.010
I don't know,
it's just the death and everything.


33
00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:29.920
Do you know what I mean?
Do you agree, Justin? Justin?


34
00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:31.920
Yeah, they're all right.

35
00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:36.320
All right? Sorry, how could you
possibly think that they're all right?


36
00:06:36.390 --> 00:06:39.760
Why are you even coming to this?
Anyway, you don't even know Daniel.


37
00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:41.320
I do know Daniel.
I met him a couple of times.


38
00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:43.374
A couple of times.
But he's not a friend, is he?


39
00:06:43.384 --> 00:06:44.630
No, not a friend.

40
00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:46.430
Sorry, if you're going to smoke,

41
00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:48.370
would you please put that
out of the window?


42
00:06:48.380 --> 00:06:51.100
I'd really rather not get your cancer,
thank you very much.


43
00:06:51.180 --> 00:06:54.170
I've got enough of my own problems
to be worrying about.


44
00:06:54.250 --> 00:06:55.640
Yeah? Like what?

45
00:06:55.710 --> 00:07:00.620
Like the discoloration on my wrist that
I keep telling you about. Look at it.


46
00:07:01.190 --> 00:07:04.280
It's fucked. I'm fucked.

47
00:07:06.890 --> 00:07:08.920
Why are you even coming?

48
00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:12.750
It's because of Martha, isn't it?

49
00:07:15.130 --> 00:07:16.430
Justin.

50
00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:22.100
- Are you okay?
- Not too bad, thanks, Martha.


51
00:07:23.640 --> 00:07:26.730
- I'm a bit nervous.
- About seeing my dad?


52
00:07:26.810 --> 00:07:30.680
I just don't think I've ever been
so openly hated by anyone before.


53
00:07:30.750 --> 00:07:33.840
He just hates everyone.
You mustn't take it to heart.


54
00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:37.910
- You need to relax with him.
- I can't help it. He puts me on edge.


55
00:07:37.990 --> 00:07:40.350
He's going to be more concerned
that his sister's husband's just died.


56
00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:42.160
He's not going to be focused on you.

57
00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:46.220
Anyway, I'm sure when I tell him that
we're getting married then, you know,


58
00:07:46.300 --> 00:07:48.050
he'll start to learn to accept you.

59
00:07:48.210 --> 00:07:50.330
- You sure about that?
- Of course.


60
00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:53.430
I don't really see Victor
as the accepting type.


61
00:07:57.010 --> 00:08:01.370
We're on our way to a funeral,
you wanker! Don't you have any respect?


62
00:08:03.650 --> 00:08:06.940
Okay. Calm down.
It's all right, it's all right. Breathe.


63
00:08:07.450 --> 00:08:09.710
In through your nose, okay?

64
00:08:09.950 --> 00:08:11.580
Deep breaths. You all right?

65
00:08:11.650 --> 00:08:13.920
- Yeah.
- Fucking tosser.


66
00:08:23.770 --> 00:08:25.320
Okay, I'm going to go down.

67
00:08:25.400 --> 00:08:27.260
Hopefully they've brought
the right coffin this time.


68
00:08:27.270 --> 00:08:29.190
- I'll come with you.
- No, it's okay. I can do it.


69
00:08:29.200 --> 00:08:32.114
Oh, no, I know you can. I'm just going
to come check on the seating.


70
00:08:32.124 --> 00:08:34.190
Make sure there's enough room
for Uncle Alfie.


71
00:08:34.350 --> 00:08:36.980
Oh, shit. Shit! Shit!

72
00:08:38.650 --> 00:08:40.240
Hello?

73
00:08:40.310 --> 00:08:43.250
Hello, mate, how are you? All right?

74
00:08:43.320 --> 00:08:44.750
Yeah.

75
00:08:44.820 --> 00:08:47.790
Of course I remember Uncle Alfie. Yeah.

76
00:08:47.860 --> 00:08:51.290
Absolutely fine. Yeah, yeah.
No, not a problem at all.


77
00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:55.260
No. Of course I don't mind. All right.

78
00:08:55.330 --> 00:08:58.300
Yeah, don't worry. All right.
No, it's fine, I promise.


79
00:08:58.370 --> 00:09:00.960
All right, we'll see you soon.
Okay, bye.


80
00:09:01.040 --> 00:09:02.230
Shit!

81
00:09:18.150 --> 00:09:20.450
So, is this your father, sir?

82
00:09:24.590 --> 00:09:26.180
Yes, it is, yes.

83
00:09:39.410 --> 00:09:41.400
Hey, Mum. You all right?

84
00:09:41.470 --> 00:09:44.170
I just don't know
what I'm going to do without him.


85
00:09:44.240 --> 00:09:47.040
- What have I got to live for now?
- Mum, don't be silly.


86
00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:50.780
You've got your friends, family.
You've got me and Jane and Robert.


87
00:09:50.850 --> 00:09:52.590
Where is Robert?
Have you heard from him?


88
00:09:52.600 --> 00:09:55.650
His plane was just landed at 10:00,
but he'll be here, don't worry.


89
00:09:55.720 --> 00:09:58.210
Now, if there's anything
I can do, Sandra.


90
00:09:58.290 --> 00:10:01.690
Don't put your hand there, dear.
You'll leave smudge marks.


91
00:10:17.640 --> 00:10:20.540
All right.
No, I'll get them to you this evening.


92
00:10:20.610 --> 00:10:23.580
No, no can do this afternoon.
I've got a funeral.


93
00:10:23.650 --> 00:10:26.120
Yeah, my uncle died. Yeah, tragic.

94
00:10:26.190 --> 00:10:28.990
No, I'm telling you, mate,
this is really powerful stuff.


95
00:10:29.150 --> 00:10:31.680
Yeah, you really only need to take half.

96
00:10:31.890 --> 00:10:34.740
No, trust me, they're going to blow
your fucking head off.


97
00:10:35.560 --> 00:10:38.560
All right, I got to go. Sister's here.
I'll take them with me


98
00:10:38.720 --> 00:10:42.180
and drop them by after the funeral.
Okay, catch you later. Bye.


99
00:10:55.010 --> 00:10:56.980
Yeah, hang on.

100
00:11:02.750 --> 00:11:04.420
Hi. How's it going?

101
00:11:04.490 --> 00:11:06.180
Troy, you're not ready.
Come on, we're gonna be late.


102
00:11:06.190 --> 00:11:09.280
Just need to put on my trousers
and I'm done. You guys okay?


103
00:11:09.360 --> 00:11:11.882
Simon's a bit freaked out.
We just had some arsehole driver


104
00:11:11.892 --> 00:11:14.530
- almost ram us off the road.
- Really? Fucking bastards.


105
00:11:14.690 --> 00:11:17.090
Make yourselves comfy.
I'll be two minutes.


106
00:11:17.170 --> 00:11:21.120
- What are these pills all over the place?
- Troy's studying to be a pharmacist.


107
00:11:21.640 --> 00:11:24.200
- Are you okay?
- I'm a bit shaky.


108
00:11:24.910 --> 00:11:26.840
Not much, just a...

109
00:11:27.340 --> 00:11:28.740
Just a bit.

110
00:11:29.310 --> 00:11:32.040
Here, have one of these.

111
00:11:33.250 --> 00:11:36.150
- It'll calm you down.
- Are you sure?


112
00:11:36.220 --> 00:11:40.250
Absolutely. It's just Valium.
I used to take them all the time.


113
00:11:40.320 --> 00:11:42.810
It'll make you feel better, honestly.

114
00:11:42.890 --> 00:11:44.660
Come on, open wide.

115
00:11:52.870 --> 00:11:54.130
Ready.

116
00:11:59.240 --> 00:12:00.570
Thank you.

117
00:12:06.620 --> 00:12:07.910
Hello?

118
00:12:11.150 --> 00:12:13.620
- Hello?
- Robert?


119
00:12:14.390 --> 00:12:15.690
Robert.

120
00:12:15.890 --> 00:12:18.160
- Hi, Mum.
- Oh, darling.


121
00:12:18.230 --> 00:12:20.390
How are you, sweetheart?

122
00:12:23.030 --> 00:12:24.500
- Hey.
- Hey.


123
00:12:24.570 --> 00:12:27.270
- Hey, how are you doing? Yeah?
- Okay. Okay. I'm okay.


124
00:12:27.430 --> 00:12:29.570
- Okay. Hi.
- Hi, Robert.


125
00:12:29.640 --> 00:12:31.380
- How are you?
- Good. Good. How are you?


126
00:12:31.390 --> 00:12:32.970
- Great.
- How was the flight?


127
00:12:33.040 --> 00:12:35.430
Great. There was a lot of turbulence,
which was a bit worrying.


128
00:12:35.440 --> 00:12:37.832
But, I mean, I guess that's
the thing about first class.


129
00:12:37.842 --> 00:12:40.030
It doesn't matter how much you pay
for the ticket,


130
00:12:40.190 --> 00:12:43.490
if the plane crashes,
you're all gonna end up dead.


131
00:12:43.820 --> 00:12:45.080
Sorry.

132
00:12:45.850 --> 00:12:48.150
No, no, I'll... Don't worry.

133
00:12:52.230 --> 00:12:53.520
Oh, shit.

134
00:13:06.440 --> 00:13:07.970
That's him.

135
00:13:08.280 --> 00:13:11.880
Jesus, Howard, you didn't say he was
going to be in a fucking wheelchair.


136
00:13:25.090 --> 00:13:29.090
Uncle Alfie. Hello.
We're here to take you to the funeral.


137
00:13:29.160 --> 00:13:32.000
Where the fuck have you been?
You're late.


138
00:13:57.460 --> 00:13:59.550
This is bloody grim, isn't it?

139
00:13:59.630 --> 00:14:03.220
- It's not supposed to be fun, Robert.
- I know, but Jesus.


140
00:14:04.100 --> 00:14:06.690
I feel like my heart has been

141
00:14:07.130 --> 00:14:10.800
- wrenched out of my ribcage. It's awful.
- Well, that's grief for you.


142
00:14:11.040 --> 00:14:13.823
This is why I prefer not to have
close relationships with people.


143
00:14:13.833 --> 00:14:16.303
There's too much emotion involved.

144
00:14:18.580 --> 00:14:21.510
Well, I'm just glad that
you're gonna be here with Mum.


145
00:14:21.580 --> 00:14:25.180
Well, yeah. Well, not for long,
'cause Jane and I are moving out.


146
00:14:26.490 --> 00:14:30.440
- Well, what about Mum?
- I was thinking maybe she'd like to


147
00:14:31.020 --> 00:14:33.680
come to New York
with you for a bit.

148
00:14:34.330 --> 00:14:36.180
Well, don't be ridiculous.
I can't take her to New York.


149
00:14:36.190 --> 00:14:38.120
What am I gonna do with her,
take her to parties?


150
00:14:38.130 --> 00:14:40.739
But we've already decided.
We're putting a deposit on a flat.


151
00:14:40.749 --> 00:14:42.199
And I'm gonna need the money.

152
00:14:42.340 --> 00:14:45.400
- What money?
- The money for all this, for the funeral.


153
00:14:45.470 --> 00:14:47.170
You agreed to pay for half.

154
00:14:47.240 --> 00:14:48.930
- Did I?
- Yeah.


155
00:14:49.670 --> 00:14:51.640
- Oh, right.
- Yeah, so...


156
00:14:53.180 --> 00:14:55.280
Yeah, well, I don't
have it on me, Daniel.


157
00:14:55.440 --> 00:14:57.740
I can get it to
you in a few months.

158
00:14:57.820 --> 00:14:59.940
In a few months? Robert, I need it now.
I need the money now.


159
00:14:59.950 --> 00:15:01.940
Yeah, well, that's not gonna happen,
is it? 'Cause I'm totally skint.


160
00:15:01.950 --> 00:15:04.050
What do you mean you're skint?

161
00:15:04.120 --> 00:15:06.294
You're a successful novelist.
You live in New York.


162
00:15:06.360 --> 00:15:08.420
You've got a penthouse apartment
in New York. What do you mean?


163
00:15:08.430 --> 00:15:10.480
Yeah, and do you have any idea
how much it costs for the upkeep?


164
00:15:10.490 --> 00:15:14.190
Besides which, I've just had to lay out
a fortune for the flight over here.


165
00:15:14.260 --> 00:15:17.360
Do you know how much they're charging
for first class nowadays?


166
00:15:17.520 --> 00:15:19.310
It's a fucking disgrace!

167
00:15:21.370 --> 00:15:24.310
- So, poor old Uncle Eddie, eh?
- Yeah.


168
00:15:24.480 --> 00:15:25.570
Yes.

169
00:15:25.640 --> 00:15:28.310
Did you ever meet Uncle Eddie, Simon?

170
00:15:28.810 --> 00:15:30.110
Simon?

171
00:15:30.780 --> 00:15:33.270
Was there a dog in here just now?

172
00:15:33.520 --> 00:15:34.810
What?

173
00:15:36.020 --> 00:15:38.650
I'm sure there was a dog in here.

174
00:15:38.860 --> 00:15:41.480
What the hell are you talking about?

175
00:15:59.810 --> 00:16:02.440
There's just nowhere to park.

176
00:16:03.110 --> 00:16:05.310
- This is ridiculous.
- How about over there?


177
00:16:05.470 --> 00:16:07.480
That guy's coming out over there.

178
00:16:07.550 --> 00:16:09.100
- Oh, right.
- Take it, take it!


179
00:16:09.260 --> 00:16:10.060
All right!

180
00:16:10.120 --> 00:16:11.120
What are you doing?

181
00:16:13.060 --> 00:16:14.990
Are you mental?

182
00:16:18.800 --> 00:16:20.060
Sorry.

183
00:16:20.330 --> 00:16:22.960
Excuse me? Hi, sorry. Oh, hi, Martha.

184
00:16:23.030 --> 00:16:25.277
I was just about to park there, actually.

185
00:16:25.288 --> 00:16:27.640
Yeah, well, are you a relative, Howard?

186
00:16:27.700 --> 00:16:30.140
- No, I'm not, but...
- Hey, Martha.


187
00:16:31.640 --> 00:16:33.040
Who's that?

188
00:16:41.920 --> 00:16:43.280
- What's happening?
- Did you see that?


189
00:16:43.290 --> 00:16:44.551
She barely even looked at me.

190
00:16:44.621 --> 00:16:46.317
I said, what's happening? Are we there?

191
00:16:46.327 --> 00:16:48.456
Oh, my God,
we've got Uncle Alfie in the car.


192
00:16:48.550 --> 00:16:51.980
I cannot believe I forgot to say
we've got Uncle Alfie in the car.


193
00:16:52.960 --> 00:16:56.120
- All right! Keep your hair on!
- What the hell's going on?


194
00:16:57.270 --> 00:16:59.200
She barely even looked.

195
00:17:08.510 --> 00:17:11.770
It's very green here, isn't it?
It's very...


196
00:17:12.350 --> 00:17:14.440
- It's green!
- Simon.


197
00:17:15.450 --> 00:17:18.610
- What the hell is the matter with you?
- What do you mean?


198
00:17:18.690 --> 00:17:23.350
All this talking about phantom dogs
and things being green. What's going on?


199
00:17:23.690 --> 00:17:25.180
I don't know.

200
00:17:30.430 --> 00:17:31.520
Wow!

201
00:17:35.140 --> 00:17:36.430
Martha,

202
00:17:37.170 --> 00:17:41.130
- is Simon normally like this?
- Of course he's not normally like this.


203
00:17:41.210 --> 00:17:43.140
Something's not right.

204
00:17:44.650 --> 00:17:45.910
Hello.

205
00:17:53.650 --> 00:17:55.990
Oh, I think it must be the Valium.

206
00:17:56.060 --> 00:17:57.650
- Valium?
- Yeah.


207
00:17:58.560 --> 00:18:00.920
I gave him a Valium from your flat.

208
00:18:00.990 --> 00:18:03.460
I think he's just not used to it.

209
00:18:04.230 --> 00:18:05.600
Oh, right.

210
00:18:09.400 --> 00:18:11.670
Do you want to get any closer?

211
00:18:11.740 --> 00:18:13.090
You're going the wrong way.

212
00:18:14.210 --> 00:18:15.900
Stop the car, Howard.
I need to speak to Martha.


213
00:18:15.910 --> 00:18:17.510
- What?
- I need to speak to her.


214
00:18:17.670 --> 00:18:19.150
I need to speak to Martha.

215
00:18:19.210 --> 00:18:22.240
What about Alfie?
I need help with Uncle Alfie.


216
00:18:22.320 --> 00:18:25.380
- We're gonna be late!
- Ow! Could you please stop doing that?


217
00:18:33.190 --> 00:18:36.790
Thank you very much for coming. It's
lovely to see you. It won't be long.


218
00:18:37.560 --> 00:18:40.330
It's weird being back here.
I feel so out of it.


219
00:18:40.400 --> 00:18:43.950
Well, it's because you're living
in a different country, you lose touch.


220
00:18:44.110 --> 00:18:47.930
Who are these people, anyway?
I don't even recognize any of them.


221
00:18:48.010 --> 00:18:50.340
Who the hell's that guy?

222
00:18:50.810 --> 00:18:53.854
I have no idea. It's probably a friend
of Dad's from work or something.


223
00:18:53.864 --> 00:18:56.980
So listen, you're telling me that I
have to pay for this entire funeral?


224
00:18:57.050 --> 00:18:59.744
I can't draw money out of thin air,
Daniel.


225
00:18:59.755 --> 00:19:01.590
Oh, Jesus fucking Christ!

226
00:19:01.650 --> 00:19:05.320
- Daniel, how's everything going?
- Fine, thanks, Reverend Davidson.


227
00:19:05.390 --> 00:19:08.260
We're just waiting for everyone to
arrive, then we can get started.


228
00:19:08.270 --> 00:19:09.290
Great. Thank you.

229
00:19:09.960 --> 00:19:13.060
- Have you met my brother Robert?
- The writer, of course.


230
00:19:13.260 --> 00:19:16.670
It's a pleasure to meet you.
I've read several of your novels.


231
00:19:16.730 --> 00:19:19.700
- Really?
- You must be very proud of your brother.


232
00:19:19.770 --> 00:19:23.260
- Yes, very proud.
- And will you be making the eulogy today?


233
00:19:23.340 --> 00:19:25.940
No, Daniel will be doing the eulogy.

234
00:19:27.210 --> 00:19:28.470
Great.

235
00:19:28.810 --> 00:19:31.840
I'll just make sure I
have everything I need.


236
00:19:35.750 --> 00:19:38.020
Listen, I think you
should do the eulogy.


237
00:19:38.090 --> 00:19:41.308
Everyone's expecting you to do it,
and I'll just make a mess of it, anyway.


238
00:19:41.318 --> 00:19:42.948
Don't be silly. You'll be...

239
00:19:43.360 --> 00:19:44.950
You'll be fine.

240
00:19:46.260 --> 00:19:49.490
- All these can go through now.
- How's my little sister?


241
00:19:49.570 --> 00:19:53.470
Just very sad.
He was a wonderful husband, wasn't he?


242
00:19:53.540 --> 00:19:57.500
- So attentive. So devoted.
- Can I get you a cup of tea, Sandra?


243
00:19:57.570 --> 00:20:01.530
Tea can do many things, Jane,
but it can't bring back the dead.


244
00:20:07.350 --> 00:20:09.200
"My father was an exceptional man..."

245
00:20:09.360 --> 00:20:12.180
"My father...
My father was an exceptional man."


246
00:20:12.260 --> 00:20:14.920
Daniel, have you called yet
about the deposit?


247
00:20:14.990 --> 00:20:16.750
- No, I haven't yet, no.
- Why don't you give me the number,


248
00:20:16.760 --> 00:20:18.190
and I could do it?

249
00:20:18.260 --> 00:20:21.347
Jane, don't make it obvious, but you see
that guy standing by the table?


250
00:20:21.357 --> 00:20:24.600
See? Do you recognize him at all?
He's really staring at me.


251
00:20:24.670 --> 00:20:28.170
Are you listening to me at all?
We have to put the deposit on that flat


252
00:20:28.330 --> 00:20:30.930
- before it's too late. You understand?
- I know.


253
00:20:31.010 --> 00:20:32.370
All right.

254
00:20:43.020 --> 00:20:45.540
- Come on, get on with it.
- I am.


255
00:20:46.620 --> 00:20:48.780
You'll break it.

256
00:20:49.020 --> 00:20:50.990
Hurry up, we're late.

257
00:20:51.890 --> 00:20:53.160
Oh, God!

258
00:20:54.700 --> 00:20:57.290
"My father was an exceptional man."

259
00:20:58.230 --> 00:21:01.290
My God, that Katie's grown up a bit,
hasn't she?


260
00:21:01.370 --> 00:21:02.770
- What?
- Katie.


261
00:21:02.840 --> 00:21:05.860
She was like a little girl when I left,
and now she's...


262
00:21:05.970 --> 00:21:09.570
She's fit.
I might go and have a chat with her.


263
00:21:09.640 --> 00:21:11.810
Yeah, why don't you do that?

264
00:21:13.720 --> 00:21:16.010
"My father was an exceptional man."

265
00:21:16.080 --> 00:21:17.950
Hello there.

266
00:21:18.020 --> 00:21:19.280
Hello.

267
00:21:20.790 --> 00:21:23.620
I was really sorry to hear
about your father.


268
00:21:23.690 --> 00:21:24.690
Mmm.

269
00:21:25.230 --> 00:21:28.860
He always talked about you,
said you were a good son.


270
00:21:29.060 --> 00:21:30.430
Thank you.

271
00:21:31.630 --> 00:21:34.330
Did he ever mention me? Peter.

272
00:21:34.830 --> 00:21:37.530
Peter? No, I don't think so.
Were you friends with Dad?


273
00:21:37.610 --> 00:21:38.610
Mmm-hmm.

274
00:21:39.410 --> 00:21:42.870
Well, okay. Nice to meet you,
and thank you for coming.


275
00:21:48.320 --> 00:21:50.720
Come on. Put your back into it.

276
00:21:50.780 --> 00:21:52.250
Jesus!

277
00:21:54.320 --> 00:21:57.950
- Push the bloody thing!
- I am pushing.


278
00:21:59.890 --> 00:22:02.120
"My father was an exceptional man.
He was born..."


279
00:22:02.200 --> 00:22:05.290
Daniel, I really think we should be
calling everyone in now


280
00:22:05.370 --> 00:22:07.130
- to start the service.
- Sure.


281
00:22:07.200 --> 00:22:09.730
Really, I'm only supposed to be here
until 3:00.


282
00:22:09.800 --> 00:22:12.300
Sure. Do you mind though if we wait
just five minutes for my Uncle Alfie?


283
00:22:12.310 --> 00:22:14.810
We really shouldn't start without him,
if possible.


284
00:22:14.970 --> 00:22:17.140
Of course, of course.

285
00:22:21.620 --> 00:22:22.620
I'll go...

286
00:22:30.290 --> 00:22:31.420
Look.

287
00:22:32.190 --> 00:22:33.950
Isn't it beautiful?

288
00:22:35.230 --> 00:22:37.660
Martha, could I have a word? Excuse me.

289
00:22:37.860 --> 00:22:41.030
- What? What is it?
- Okay, I have to tell you something.


290
00:22:41.100 --> 00:22:44.500
And I warn you in advance,
you're not gonna like it.


291
00:22:45.100 --> 00:22:47.350
Good to see you.
Thank you for coming as well.


292
00:22:47.510 --> 00:22:49.830
- Daniel. Hello, Robert.
- Hello, Uncle Victor.


293
00:22:50.380 --> 00:22:52.900
- Uncle Victor, how are you?
- Well...


294
00:22:54.080 --> 00:22:56.010
- Sad day.
- Yeah.


295
00:22:56.120 --> 00:22:59.550
- So, how are things in New York?
- Great. Really good, yeah.


296
00:22:59.620 --> 00:23:03.050
What's all this nonsense I hear about
you not doing the eulogy?


297
00:23:03.120 --> 00:23:05.332
That's right.
Daniel's gonna do the eulogy.


298
00:23:05.343 --> 00:23:06.900
Well, that's a damn shame.

299
00:23:06.960 --> 00:23:09.260
I mean, I'm sure Daniel will be fine,

300
00:23:09.330 --> 00:23:12.660
but after all,
you are the writer in the family.


301
00:23:13.130 --> 00:23:15.600
Will you just excuse me a second?

302
00:23:16.400 --> 00:23:19.000
So, any new books coming out?

303
00:23:19.070 --> 00:23:21.540
- I'll just get my things together.
- Sure.


304
00:23:21.610 --> 00:23:23.130
You all right?

305
00:23:23.210 --> 00:23:26.470
Every single bloody person
wants Robert to do the eulogy.


306
00:23:26.540 --> 00:23:29.932
He was my father, too, wasn't he? I'm
just as entitled to do the bloody eulogy.


307
00:23:29.942 --> 00:23:32.610
Yes, of course you are.
Of course you are.


308
00:23:32.680 --> 00:23:35.880
And it's going to be the best
bloody eulogy anybody's ever heard.


309
00:23:36.040 --> 00:23:39.780
Did you hear? Apparently,
Robert won't be doing the eulogy.


310
00:23:43.690 --> 00:23:46.740
- What did you just say?
- I said the Valium you gave to Simon


311
00:23:46.900 --> 00:23:49.460
wasn't actually Valium.

312
00:23:49.530 --> 00:23:52.900
It's an hallucinogenic concoction.

313
00:23:52.970 --> 00:23:56.570
You know, stuff like acid, mescaline,
a little ketamine.


314
00:23:56.640 --> 00:23:57.940
This isn't funny, Troy.

315
00:23:58.010 --> 00:24:00.980
I'm not being funny.
Look at him. He's off his tits!


316
00:24:03.180 --> 00:24:05.740
You absolute little twat!

317
00:24:05.850 --> 00:24:08.040
What the hell are you doing
leaving this stuff around your flat?


318
00:24:08.050 --> 00:24:09.410
I didn't know someone was gonna take it,
did I?


319
00:24:09.420 --> 00:24:12.470
Who just goes into someone else's flat
and takes random pills?


320
00:24:12.630 --> 00:24:14.680
They were in a Valium bottle.

321
00:24:14.930 --> 00:24:16.690
Fuck, Troy!

322
00:24:16.760 --> 00:24:19.560
What the hell am I meant to do?
Should I tell him?


323
00:24:19.630 --> 00:24:23.120
No! Don't do that.
It'll just freak him out completely.


324
00:24:23.200 --> 00:24:25.418
I think we should just keep
a very close eye on him.


325
00:24:25.428 --> 00:24:27.300
Make sure he doesn't get out of control.

326
00:24:27.460 --> 00:24:30.950
And don't let him spend too long
talking to one person.


327
00:24:31.140 --> 00:24:32.140
Shit.

328
00:24:48.390 --> 00:24:50.290
Hey, Dad, how are you doing?

329
00:24:50.360 --> 00:24:51.830
- You're late.
- Hey, Dad.


330
00:24:51.890 --> 00:24:53.867
Hi, Troy. You missing university today?

331
00:24:53.878 --> 00:24:56.150
Yeah, not to worry, though. 
I'll catch up.

332
00:24:56.300 --> 00:25:00.800
I know, I'm not worried about you.
I see you've brought your friend along.


333
00:25:00.870 --> 00:25:05.240
His name's Simon. Simon. And of course
I brought him along, he's my boyfriend.


334
00:25:05.310 --> 00:25:08.110
Martha. So good to see you.

335
00:25:08.180 --> 00:25:11.270
I'm so sorry, Aunt Sandra.
We're gonna miss Uncle Edward terribly.


336
00:25:11.350 --> 00:25:13.080
- Thank you.
- He was a great guy.


337
00:25:13.150 --> 00:25:15.120
Yes. Yes, he was. Thank you, Troy.

338
00:25:15.180 --> 00:25:18.240
Simon, this is my...

339
00:25:18.320 --> 00:25:20.880
I'm so sorry about the death.

340
00:25:23.460 --> 00:25:26.480
I'm so sorry.

341
00:25:27.130 --> 00:25:29.430
- Thank you.
- And everything.


342
00:25:29.500 --> 00:25:31.060
Come on, Simon.

343
00:25:45.050 --> 00:25:47.310
- What are you gonna do?
- I don't know.


344
00:25:47.380 --> 00:25:51.680
I can't leave, can I? Aunt Sandra'll
never speak to me again. Oh, shit!


345
00:25:54.090 --> 00:25:55.680
Hey, Martha.

346
00:26:12.740 --> 00:26:16.180
- Hey, you look nice.
- I'm dressed for a funeral.


347
00:26:16.240 --> 00:26:18.140
Yeah, but still.

348
00:26:18.750 --> 00:26:22.080
So, I heard about the engagement.
What's that about?


349
00:26:22.480 --> 00:26:25.210
Who told you that?
I haven't even told my dad.


350
00:26:25.290 --> 00:26:27.310
Is that the guy you're gonna marry?

351
00:26:27.390 --> 00:26:30.620
You're gonna spend
the rest of your life with him?


352
00:26:30.890 --> 00:26:32.550
Yep, that's him.

353
00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:41.800
- Simon?
- Martha. Martha.


354
00:26:41.870 --> 00:26:43.930
You're slow. Come on!

355
00:26:47.310 --> 00:26:50.740
- Any chance of a hand, Justin?
- Hey, lift it, lift it!


356
00:26:51.110 --> 00:26:53.640
Lift it. Lift it. 
You got to lift it.

357
00:26:53.710 --> 00:26:58.080
Hi, Daniel. Actually, there's something
I really wanted to talk to you about


358
00:26:58.150 --> 00:27:00.150
- when you have a moment.
- Okay, that's great.


359
00:27:00.160 --> 00:27:01.250
Do you mind if
we do it later, though?

360
00:27:01.260 --> 00:27:03.350
'Cause my Uncle Alfie's
just arrived and I...


361
00:27:03.510 --> 00:27:04.800
Sure.

362
00:27:05.820 --> 00:27:06.980
Up!

363
00:27:08.230 --> 00:27:09.520
Come on!

364
00:27:11.330 --> 00:27:13.157
Thank you, Justin.
Thank you so much, mate.


365
00:27:13.177 --> 00:27:14.907
Hope it wasn't too much hassle.

366
00:27:14.987 --> 00:27:17.190
- How are you, Uncle Alfie?
- Terrible.


367
00:27:31.150 --> 00:27:35.480
Ladies and gentlemen,
if you could all kindly take your seats.


368
00:27:35.550 --> 00:27:38.020
We're about to begin the service.

369
00:27:43.030 --> 00:27:44.460
Simon, please.

370
00:27:44.530 --> 00:27:49.230
Move. Move.
Don't start yet. Don't start. Move.


371
00:28:36.580 --> 00:28:38.600
Jesus, Howard, you stink!

372
00:28:40.780 --> 00:28:43.510
Family and friends.

373
00:28:43.720 --> 00:28:47.520
Maybe, that's because you left me
to deal with Uncle Alfie on my own.


374
00:28:47.590 --> 00:28:51.240
- Not to mention taking all the credit.
- Howard, can you please be quiet?


375
00:28:51.400 --> 00:28:54.590
And I'd like to start
with a favorite passage of Edward's


376
00:28:54.660 --> 00:28:56.460
from the King James Bible.

377
00:28:56.530 --> 00:29:00.300
It's the First Book of
Samuel, Chapter 18.


378
00:29:02.200 --> 00:29:07.230
Actually, Martha, just so you know,
we had Uncle Alfie in the car with us,


379
00:29:07.310 --> 00:29:09.940
and you took my parking space,
and I had to push him


380
00:29:10.010 --> 00:29:14.010
about half a mile up a hill, by myself,
and we almost missed the service.


381
00:29:14.080 --> 00:29:15.410
That was my parking space.

382
00:29:15.480 --> 00:29:17.410
Listen, Howard, if you don't stop
poking me on the shoulder,


383
00:29:17.420 --> 00:29:19.750
I am going to take you outside and
kick the living shit out of you.


384
00:29:19.760 --> 00:29:21.250
- Do you understand me?
- What is going on?


385
00:29:21.260 --> 00:29:22.610
She stole my parking space.

386
00:29:22.680 --> 00:29:24.930
What do you mean
she stole your parking space?


387
00:29:25.090 --> 00:29:27.530
This is a funeral. 
Behave yourself.

388
00:29:28.760 --> 00:29:33.430
"Then Jonathan and David
made a covenant,"


389
00:29:33.500 --> 00:29:36.470
"because he loved him as his own soul."

390
00:29:37.470 --> 00:29:41.000
"And it came to pass
that the soul of Jonathan"


391
00:29:41.080 --> 00:29:46.210
"was knit with the soul of David.
And Jonathan stripped himself"


392
00:29:46.280 --> 00:29:50.380
"of the robe that was upon him
and gave it to David,"


393
00:29:51.050 --> 00:29:54.350
"and his garments, even to his sword,"

394
00:29:54.720 --> 00:29:56.990
"and to his bow,"

395
00:29:57.230 --> 00:29:59.490
"and to his girdle."

396
00:30:03.400 --> 00:30:07.560
And now, we'll have a few words
from Edward's son,


397
00:30:07.640 --> 00:30:08.930
Daniel.

398
00:30:22.720 --> 00:30:24.450
Hi, everyone.

399
00:30:24.520 --> 00:30:27.080
Thanks to so many of you for coming.

400
00:30:28.360 --> 00:30:30.920
I never realized Dad was so popular.

401
00:30:31.490 --> 00:30:34.590
In fact, it seems like he's got
more friends now that he's dead


402
00:30:34.750 --> 00:30:36.480
than when he was alive.

403
00:30:50.810 --> 00:30:53.180
"My father was an exceptional man."

404
00:30:53.250 --> 00:30:57.050
"He was born in 1938,
just a year before the war."


405
00:30:57.120 --> 00:30:59.710
"I'll never forget the time
when Dad took us to"


406
00:30:59.790 --> 00:31:04.310
"the place where he grew up, just
near a town called Crawley in Sussex."


407
00:31:05.090 --> 00:31:09.390
"It's changed a lot over the years, what
with the expansion of Gatwick airport,"


408
00:31:09.460 --> 00:31:12.410
"and it's actually become
something of a commuter town now,"


409
00:31:12.570 --> 00:31:15.900
"partly because of its
proximity to London."


410
00:31:17.100 --> 00:31:21.000
"But at the time when my dad was young,
it was really quite pastoral."


411
00:31:21.070 --> 00:31:23.100
"Lots of fields"

412
00:31:24.080 --> 00:31:27.530
"and greenery, and Dad would roam
around the countryside for hours"


413
00:31:27.610 --> 00:31:30.480
"with his close boyhood friend, Bob."

414
00:31:30.550 --> 00:31:34.650
"He told me how they spent
their summer days riding their bikes..."


415
00:31:35.050 --> 00:31:38.350
- Did you just see that?
- "...through the local cornfields..."


416
00:31:38.420 --> 00:31:41.920
- The coffin, it just moved.
- "...and swimming in the lake."


417
00:31:41.990 --> 00:31:43.320
"Dad's..."

418
00:31:43.930 --> 00:31:46.290
I'm telling you, 
I saw it move.

419
00:31:48.700 --> 00:31:51.650
"Dad's first job was working
after school as an apprentice,"


420
00:31:53.540 --> 00:31:57.300
- "for an electrician named Mr. Thomson."
- There! It happened again!


421
00:31:57.380 --> 00:32:00.810
- Simon, settle down.
- I'm telling you, the coffin is moving!


422
00:32:00.880 --> 00:32:03.040
Simon, just calm down.

423
00:32:03.750 --> 00:32:07.950
Please, God, the coffin is moving,
I tell you!


424
00:32:09.020 --> 00:32:12.390
- There's someone alive in there!
- Simon, where are you going?


425
00:32:13.120 --> 00:32:15.680
What the hell is wrong with you all?

426
00:32:15.760 --> 00:32:17.950
- Don't you look at me like that!
- Simon.


427
00:32:18.030 --> 00:32:21.590
Can't you see? 
Open your eyes!

428
00:32:21.670 --> 00:32:26.360
There's someone moving around in there!
Can't you see?


429
00:32:26.440 --> 00:32:28.200
- Simon!
- What are you doing?


430
00:32:28.270 --> 00:32:31.240
Simon, stop that! Simon,
don't touch that!


431
00:32:31.310 --> 00:32:33.710
- What are you doing?
- I'm going to let you out!


432
00:32:33.870 --> 00:32:35.420
What are you doing?

433
00:32:36.010 --> 00:32:37.540
Oh, God!

434
00:32:44.290 --> 00:32:46.850
Mum, it's all right, it's all right.

435
00:32:52.800 --> 00:32:54.230
It's okay.

436
00:32:55.870 --> 00:32:58.860
Put the kettle on. All
right, Mum, all right.


437
00:32:59.470 --> 00:33:01.400
All right. Help me.

438
00:33:03.940 --> 00:33:07.340
That was unbelievable, wasn't it?
All right.


439
00:33:08.010 --> 00:33:11.240
If you'd all like to have
some lovely tea and cake,


440
00:33:11.480 --> 00:33:14.110
we'll get back to you
as soon as we can.

441
00:33:17.820 --> 00:33:20.212
- What the fuck was that about?
- Daniel, I am so sorry.


442
00:33:20.222 --> 00:33:22.420
- I'm so sorry.
- The coffin was moving.


443
00:33:22.490 --> 00:33:25.520
Just go back inside and I'll
explain later. I am so sorry.


444
00:33:25.590 --> 00:33:30.030
- There was a definite scratching sound.
- Sorry. Oh, God, please, please.


445
00:33:31.300 --> 00:33:32.890
- Are you all right?
- No.


446
00:33:32.970 --> 00:33:35.420
No, I haven't made the call
about the deposit yet.


447
00:33:38.140 --> 00:33:39.500
I'll kill him!

448
00:33:39.570 --> 00:33:42.370
- Just calm down.
- I'm going to kill him!


449
00:33:42.960 --> 00:33:44.310
- Dad, leave it.
- Leave it?


450
00:33:44.380 --> 00:33:46.989
- He's completely wrecked the funeral!
- It wasn't his fault.


451
00:33:46.999 --> 00:33:48.969
What do you mean it wasn't his fault?

452
00:33:49.029 --> 00:33:50.850
Your Aunt Sandra is in tatters.

453
00:33:50.920 --> 00:33:53.750
I want him out of here right
this minute. Is that clear?


454
00:33:53.820 --> 00:33:58.050
Tell me you will have nothing to do
with that ridiculous man ever again.


455
00:33:58.130 --> 00:33:59.460
I'm sorry.

456
00:33:59.530 --> 00:34:02.190
No, I can't do that.

457
00:34:02.260 --> 00:34:03.860
Why not?

458
00:34:04.570 --> 00:34:07.330
Because we're moving in together.

459
00:34:07.400 --> 00:34:09.060
Dear God.

460
00:34:09.140 --> 00:34:12.110
Have you completely lost your senses?

461
00:34:12.170 --> 00:34:13.570
He isn't actually like this.

462
00:34:13.640 --> 00:34:16.970
He had some drugs
and they made him act all weird.


463
00:34:17.040 --> 00:34:20.310
Drugs? What drugs?

464
00:34:24.950 --> 00:34:28.410
He took some Valium
and he had a bad reaction.


465
00:34:31.660 --> 00:34:33.630
- Valium?
- Yeah.


466
00:34:40.330 --> 00:34:42.630
We'll talk about this later.

467
00:34:50.040 --> 00:34:52.140
- Simon.
- Martha.


468
00:34:52.210 --> 00:34:53.710
Yeah, okay. Come and sit down.

469
00:34:54.070 --> 00:34:56.670
Thank you, Janet, I appreciate that.
That's for sure.


470
00:34:56.750 --> 00:34:59.380
- All right, mate?
- Hey. Hello, mate.


471
00:34:59.850 --> 00:35:01.150
That was awful. Wasn't it?

472
00:35:01.220 --> 00:35:03.655
Landing in front of your mum like that
like a dead trout.


473
00:35:03.665 --> 00:35:06.260
- Yeah, Howard, please. Come on.
- Yeah, sorry.


474
00:35:06.330 --> 00:35:10.350
It's just... You just never know
when it's gonna happen to you.


475
00:35:10.430 --> 00:35:15.060
That's all. It's like with me, I've
got... It's like a weird patch of skin.


476
00:35:15.130 --> 00:35:18.130
I've had that a couple of weeks.
I've absolutely no idea what that is.


477
00:35:18.140 --> 00:35:21.120
Why don't you show it to my Uncle
Victor? You know, he's a doctor.


478
00:35:21.280 --> 00:35:22.580
Yes.

479
00:35:23.840 --> 00:35:25.110
Hello.

480
00:35:26.080 --> 00:35:27.810
I swear I saw it moving.

481
00:35:28.050 --> 00:35:31.880
I saw it moving. No one else saw.
No one else saw.


482
00:35:31.950 --> 00:35:34.780
I swear I saw it moving.
I must be going mad.


483
00:35:34.850 --> 00:35:37.520
Why are my hands so big?

484
00:35:37.590 --> 00:35:41.290
Simon, listen to me.
I need to tell you something.


485
00:35:42.930 --> 00:35:46.090
You know I gave you some Valium earlier?

486
00:35:46.870 --> 00:35:49.490
- Yes.
- Well,


487
00:35:50.040 --> 00:35:56.200
it turns out
that it wasn't actually Valium at all.


488
00:35:57.680 --> 00:35:59.230
Mmm-hmm.

489
00:36:00.350 --> 00:36:02.870
- Can you hear me?
- Hello?


490
00:36:03.250 --> 00:36:05.946
- Do you think we can start again now?
- I believe we can, yes.


491
00:36:05.956 --> 00:36:08.706
- How are you feeling, Sandra?
- Much better, thank you.


492
00:36:09.890 --> 00:36:10.910
Hello, Doctor.

493
00:36:10.990 --> 00:36:13.810
I've got this skin discoloration.
I've had it for a couple of weeks now.


494
00:36:13.820 --> 00:36:15.081
It's just not going anywhere.

495
00:36:15.091 --> 00:36:17.690
Now, I know it's just a small patch,
but it's weird.


496
00:36:17.760 --> 00:36:19.310
It does look weird, doesn't it?

497
00:36:19.470 --> 00:36:21.160
Victor, I'm going back now.

498
00:36:21.470 --> 00:36:23.470
You should probably go
and see a dermatologist.


499
00:36:23.480 --> 00:36:25.030
Why, what do you think it is?

500
00:36:25.100 --> 00:36:27.660
Looks like some kind
of pigment mutation.


501
00:36:27.740 --> 00:36:28.800
A pigment mutation?

502
00:36:28.870 --> 00:36:32.670
Could be an allergic reaction
to shellfish, nuts.


503
00:36:32.740 --> 00:36:34.400
Nuts? What kind of nuts?

504
00:36:34.480 --> 00:36:37.450
I don't know. Peanuts, almonds.
Excuse me.


505
00:36:42.620 --> 00:36:44.920
Do you see now?

506
00:36:45.590 --> 00:36:47.250
Yes.

507
00:36:50.130 --> 00:36:52.030
Hallucinogenic.

508
00:36:57.830 --> 00:37:01.400
Now, my advice is to relax
and just go with the flow.


509
00:37:01.470 --> 00:37:03.670
You know, try and enjoy it.

510
00:37:03.740 --> 00:37:05.170
You!

511
00:37:06.440 --> 00:37:07.500
Simon!

512
00:37:07.580 --> 00:37:11.950
- How long does it last?
- I don't know, about eight hours.


513
00:37:12.820 --> 00:37:15.550
- Eight hours of this?
- Simon, let go!


514
00:37:15.620 --> 00:37:16.850
You!

515
00:37:18.020 --> 00:37:21.290
- Simon?
- Oh, my God, I'm going to be sick!


516
00:37:21.360 --> 00:37:22.620
No.

517
00:37:24.430 --> 00:37:27.730
Simon, come back. Simon.

518
00:37:28.900 --> 00:37:31.390
- Hey, listen, Martha...
- Simon!


519
00:37:32.730 --> 00:37:35.670
Excuse me, sorry, he's going to be sick.
Excuse me.


520
00:37:35.740 --> 00:37:38.370
Sorry, mind out, mind out.
He's gonna be sick.


521
00:37:39.070 --> 00:37:41.370
Come up here. Quick.

522
00:37:46.210 --> 00:37:48.510
Do you want me... Simon?

523
00:37:52.290 --> 00:37:54.080
Simon, are you okay?

524
00:37:55.220 --> 00:37:56.490
Simon?

525
00:37:57.060 --> 00:37:59.030
Simon, let me in.

526
00:38:01.600 --> 00:38:03.460
- Simon.
- Martha.


527
00:38:04.200 --> 00:38:07.430
Did you happen to see a pill bottle?
Shit!


528
00:38:07.500 --> 00:38:08.990
- Simon?
- Right.


529
00:38:09.070 --> 00:38:11.370
- Are you okay? Simon?
- Keep it together.


530
00:38:11.440 --> 00:38:13.840
Keep it together. 
You can do this.

531
00:38:13.980 --> 00:38:16.270
- Simon.
- You're Simon Smith.


532
00:38:17.550 --> 00:38:19.710
You're a solicitor.

533
00:38:19.780 --> 00:38:21.650
You're a solicitor.

534
00:38:22.450 --> 00:38:24.940
Eight hours. It's no problem.

535
00:38:25.020 --> 00:38:27.320
- Please, open the door.
- Eight hours he said.


536
00:38:27.480 --> 00:38:30.110
- Simon?
- Where's my watch?


537
00:38:30.730 --> 00:38:33.250
- Please open the door.
- It's already been...


538
00:38:34.300 --> 00:38:36.860
- I took Valium.
- Simon, open the door.


539
00:38:37.870 --> 00:38:40.030
- Seven hours to go.
- Simon?


540
00:38:40.100 --> 00:38:43.040
God, Jesus, fuck!

541
00:38:43.100 --> 00:38:44.230
Fuck!

542
00:38:44.810 --> 00:38:46.830
It's nothing to worry about. It's fine.

543
00:38:46.910 --> 00:38:48.400
Jesus fuck!

544
00:38:49.040 --> 00:38:51.390
Grief does strange things to people,
doesn't it?


545
00:38:51.550 --> 00:38:53.140
Yeah. Yeah.

546
00:38:53.210 --> 00:38:56.310
If you remember, I had something
I wanted to talk to you about.


547
00:38:56.440 --> 00:38:57.240
Oh, yes, yes.

548
00:38:57.250 --> 00:38:59.450
- Is there someplace quiet we can go?
- Sure.


549
00:39:27.410 --> 00:39:29.350
- Are you writing a book?
- Yes.


550
00:39:29.420 --> 00:39:31.640
- Like your brother.
- Well, different from my brother, but...


551
00:39:31.650 --> 00:39:33.900
- He's a great writer, isn't he?
- Yes, he is.


552
00:39:34.060 --> 00:39:35.240
So, anyway?

553
00:39:35.320 --> 00:39:39.850
Yes, actually, I have some photos
I wanted to show you.


554
00:39:40.030 --> 00:39:41.320
Okay.

555
00:39:41.560 --> 00:39:43.530
- May I?
- Sure.


556
00:39:46.100 --> 00:39:50.000
We became quite close, your father
and I, in the last few months.


557
00:39:50.070 --> 00:39:52.370
Ended up spending
quite a lot of time together.


558
00:39:52.530 --> 00:39:53.330
Right.

559
00:39:53.670 --> 00:39:56.230
Here's me and your father
in Regent's Park.


560
00:39:56.310 --> 00:39:57.470
Oh, yeah.

561
00:39:57.540 --> 00:40:01.310
Here we are on top
of one of those London buses.


562
00:40:01.380 --> 00:40:03.180
It's a terrible picture of me.

563
00:40:03.250 --> 00:40:07.310
- So, where did you and my dad meet?
- Just around.


564
00:40:11.160 --> 00:40:12.320
Hello?

565
00:40:12.890 --> 00:40:14.150
Simon.

566
00:40:15.630 --> 00:40:16.650
Are you all right?

567
00:40:16.730 --> 00:40:19.460
Wow. Yes.

568
00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:25.590
Yes, yes. Keep coming.
You, join the others.


569
00:40:26.200 --> 00:40:29.900
Join the others. Oh, you.

570
00:40:30.910 --> 00:40:37.370
Oh, here, yes. Here we are
at a fancy costume party in Kensington.


571
00:40:37.450 --> 00:40:41.080
That's your dad dressed up
as a Roman centurion.


572
00:40:49.060 --> 00:40:51.713
Sorry, in what capacity
were you actually friends with my dad?


573
00:40:51.723 --> 00:40:54.850
I mean, I don't mean to be...
But he never mentioned you to me.


574
00:40:54.930 --> 00:40:59.600
And yet you have all these pictures
where you're going around like you're...


575
00:41:29.060 --> 00:41:32.260
Oh, God. Oh, my God. No.

576
00:41:35.270 --> 00:41:37.770
Now, I know this must come
as quite a shock to you.


577
00:41:37.840 --> 00:41:40.370
I'm sure he would have told you himself,

578
00:41:40.440 --> 00:41:43.310
but I guess he wasn't sure
how you'd react.


579
00:41:43.380 --> 00:41:45.280
- Does my mother know about this?
- No.


580
00:41:45.440 --> 00:41:46.340
- No.
- No, no.


581
00:41:46.420 --> 00:41:49.440
And there's really no reason
why she should find out.


582
00:41:49.520 --> 00:41:52.250
Just as long as I
get what's owed to me.

583
00:41:52.760 --> 00:41:53.850
What?

584
00:41:54.620 --> 00:41:57.150
Well, I think I deserve something.

585
00:41:58.060 --> 00:42:00.690
I mean, your father and I were lovers.

586
00:42:01.560 --> 00:42:04.620
No, he left me absolutely nothing
in his will.


587
00:42:05.770 --> 00:42:08.000
How do you think that makes me feel?

588
00:42:08.070 --> 00:42:11.060
I'll tell you how that makes me feel.
Cheap.


589
00:42:11.740 --> 00:42:13.400
Like a cheap slut.

590
00:42:14.180 --> 00:42:16.700
Don't you think I deserve something?

591
00:42:16.910 --> 00:42:18.540
What do you want?

592
00:42:19.550 --> 00:42:22.980
Well, I think about
£ 15,000 should do it.

593
00:42:23.820 --> 00:42:25.340
£ 15,000?

594
00:42:25.990 --> 00:42:29.290
- I'm supposed to be buying a flat.
- Well, that's up to you.


595
00:42:29.360 --> 00:42:31.120
Hang on, you hang on a minute.

596
00:42:31.190 --> 00:42:33.240
You think you can come in here
and show me


597
00:42:33.310 --> 00:42:36.610
a few pictures of you and my dad
on a bus and that counts as proof?


598
00:42:36.770 --> 00:42:39.090
That's not fucking proof of anything.

599
00:42:40.170 --> 00:42:41.640
What is that?

600
00:42:42.170 --> 00:42:43.640
Oh, Jesus!

601
00:42:44.370 --> 00:42:47.970
Now, I don't want to,
but I will go out there


602
00:42:48.040 --> 00:42:50.840
and I will show these photographs
to every single person.


603
00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:53.430
Do you really want me to do that?

604
00:42:56.280 --> 00:42:59.010
You wait here. Wait here.

605
00:43:02.790 --> 00:43:06.250
Daniel, I was just telling George here
how when we were boys together,


606
00:43:06.330 --> 00:43:10.630
your dad used to love to
make us all go skinny-dipping.


607
00:43:14.530 --> 00:43:16.260
I think she's fine.

608
00:43:27.280 --> 00:43:30.040
Simon, open the door.

609
00:43:31.920 --> 00:43:33.780
Anything I can do to help?

610
00:43:33.850 --> 00:43:36.880
- Not really, thanks.
- You got it all under control?


611
00:43:37.460 --> 00:43:38.750
Simon?

612
00:43:39.620 --> 00:43:42.490
So what are you doing next weekend?
I've got a couple of tickets...


613
00:43:42.500 --> 00:43:44.674
Look, Justin,
I've got a lot on my plate right now,


614
00:43:44.684 --> 00:43:46.350
and I just can't deal with your shit.

615
00:43:46.510 --> 00:43:50.440
Now, can you please just go away?
Please?


616
00:43:52.940 --> 00:43:54.570
Simon?

617
00:43:58.810 --> 00:44:00.730
Hi, Robert.
Can I talk to you for a second?


618
00:44:00.741 --> 00:44:01.547
Not now.

619
00:44:01.550 --> 00:44:04.550
- Just give me five minutes.
- It's important. It's ever so important.


620
00:44:04.560 --> 00:44:06.290
- Excuse me.
- Okay.


621
00:44:06.350 --> 00:44:08.510
- What are you doing?
- Robert, listen.


622
00:44:13.660 --> 00:44:17.920
You know that guy from before that we
didn't recognize? That little guy,


623
00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:21.350
you know, the short guy, yeah?
I've just been with him in the study.


624
00:44:21.510 --> 00:44:25.640
- Yeah?
- And he showed me these pictures.


625
00:44:26.240 --> 00:44:28.140
- Yeah? Right.
- Of him and dad.


626
00:44:29.470 --> 00:44:33.070
- Of him and dad together.
- Right.


627
00:44:33.410 --> 00:44:35.497
Of him and Dad together
at parties in Kensington.


628
00:44:35.527 --> 00:44:37.377
Look, Daniel, is this going anywhere?

629
00:44:37.537 --> 00:44:41.860
- For God's sake, he was shagging dad!
- Fuck off!


630
00:44:45.103 --> 00:44:45.973
Are you shitting me?

631
00:44:45.983 --> 00:44:47.809
No, I'm not shitting you, 
I'm telling you.

632
00:44:47.819 --> 00:44:49.880
He showed me the pictures. I feel sick.

633
00:44:49.960 --> 00:44:54.020
So, wait, wait, what are you saying?
That Dad was a gay?


634
00:44:54.370 --> 00:44:55.820
Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

635
00:44:57.230 --> 00:44:59.860
- And he was cheating on Mum?
- Well, evidently.


636
00:45:00.140 --> 00:45:03.600
- With that little...
- Yes.


637
00:45:03.840 --> 00:45:07.140
I know it's a bombshell, but the concern
right now is that he wants money.


638
00:45:07.210 --> 00:45:08.570
- What do you mean he wants money?
- He wants money.


639
00:45:08.580 --> 00:45:10.840
- He wants £ 15,000.
- Tell him to go and fuck himself!


640
00:45:10.850 --> 00:45:12.810
No, you don't understand.
He's got the pictures.


641
00:45:12.820 --> 00:45:15.010
And if we don't give him the money,
he's gonna tell everybody here


642
00:45:15.020 --> 00:45:16.890
the most intimate details
of their sex life.


643
00:45:16.910 --> 00:45:19.606
I don't wanna hear the most
intimate details of their sex life.


644
00:45:19.616 --> 00:45:21.846
Exactly. So what are we gonna do?

645
00:45:22.190 --> 00:45:25.180
- Oh, shit.
- Think, then.


646
00:45:26.530 --> 00:45:28.520
Okay, all right.

647
00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:36.087
This is a total fucking waste of time.
I don't know why I even bothered.


648
00:45:36.097 --> 00:45:38.240
I got dressed up and everything,
you know?


649
00:45:38.310 --> 00:45:41.006
I mean, how could she be more interested
in that idiot up there


650
00:45:41.016 --> 00:45:42.170
than she is in me?

651
00:45:42.250 --> 00:45:44.200
I'm telling you, Howard.
This world is severely fucked up.


652
00:45:44.210 --> 00:45:46.360
- Sounds really serious, doesn't it?
- What?


653
00:45:46.520 --> 00:45:48.610
Pigment mutation.

654
00:45:50.120 --> 00:45:53.050
Oh, will you taste this?
I think it's got almonds in it.


655
00:45:53.120 --> 00:45:55.250
- So?
- So? Daniel's uncle said I'm allergic


656
00:45:55.320 --> 00:45:57.020
- to almonds.
- Well, don't eat it.


657
00:45:57.070 --> 00:45:59.592
Go on, please. Be a mate. Taste it.
Tell me what you think.


658
00:45:59.602 --> 00:46:00.730
- No.
- Go on, try it.


659
00:46:00.800 --> 00:46:03.350
- I don't want to.
- Please. Come on, do me a favor.


660
00:46:03.510 --> 00:46:06.630
- Can't you just do me a favor?
- Please fuck off!


661
00:46:08.440 --> 00:46:10.745
You haven't seen a pill bottle
lying around, have you?


662
00:46:10.755 --> 00:46:12.130
Like a Valium pill bottle?

663
00:46:12.210 --> 00:46:14.610
- No.
- Shit. Shit. Shit.


664
00:46:26.920 --> 00:46:29.250
Shouldn't be long now.

665
00:46:36.830 --> 00:46:39.930
- Shall we go inside?
- In a minute.


666
00:46:47.610 --> 00:46:49.240
Doctor, you know you...

667
00:47:00.690 --> 00:47:05.790
Hello. Sorry about... 
Well, you know.

668
00:47:06.030 --> 00:47:07.990
- Thank you.
- Yeah, sorry.


669
00:47:08.460 --> 00:47:11.900
Oh, God, it must be terrible
losing a husband.


670
00:47:11.970 --> 00:47:14.760
Still, you're still so young.
Relatively.


671
00:47:16.740 --> 00:47:21.730
Do you think you'll marry again?
Probably too soon to say, isn't it?


672
00:47:21.810 --> 00:47:25.440
God, it's just terrible, isn't it,
that people die? Awful.


673
00:47:25.510 --> 00:47:28.500
There was a guy that I know,
he got stabbed to death.


674
00:47:28.580 --> 00:47:32.040
And he called this guy's mother a moose.
The guy just...


675
00:47:32.120 --> 00:47:36.380
Just stabbed him right in the neck,
hit like a major artery.


676
00:47:36.460 --> 00:47:40.150
And there was blood, just...
You honestly would not believe how much


677
00:47:40.230 --> 00:47:44.490
just spurting absolutely everywhere.
And ridiculous thing is


678
00:47:44.560 --> 00:47:46.810
that the guy that did it
told the police later


679
00:47:46.970 --> 00:47:49.740
he didn't even know what a moose was.

680
00:47:51.670 --> 00:47:56.570
Has that cake got almonds in it?
It's not important, doesn't matter.


681
00:48:00.010 --> 00:48:05.110
- Excuse me.
- Mmm. Nice talk.


682
00:48:15.690 --> 00:48:16.920
I just don't think
Mum can handle it.


683
00:48:16.930 --> 00:48:18.050
Let me rephrase the question.

684
00:48:18.060 --> 00:48:20.669
What do you mean, you think it's best
if I pay him the money?


685
00:48:20.770 --> 00:48:22.560
You've been living off Mum and Dad
for long enough.


686
00:48:22.570 --> 00:48:25.136
- You must have some money saved.
- I haven't been living...


687
00:48:25.146 --> 00:48:27.098
I've paid for this entire funeral, Robert.

688
00:48:27.109 --> 00:48:28.480
Now, wait a second.

689
00:48:28.540 --> 00:48:30.690
How do you know
this guy isn't bullshitting?


690
00:48:34.850 --> 00:48:36.210
Oh, my God!

691
00:48:39.050 --> 00:48:42.950
- Simon?
- Simon.


692
00:48:44.820 --> 00:48:50.230
- Simon? Simon?
- Simon. Simon.


693
00:48:52.500 --> 00:48:56.490
- Simon.
- Simon.


694
00:48:57.500 --> 00:49:00.960
- Si?
- Mon.


695
00:49:10.650 --> 00:49:12.610
I think we're just about ready
to resume the service, so...


696
00:49:12.620 --> 00:49:14.520
Would you mind giving us five minutes?

697
00:49:14.680 --> 00:49:16.440
- Of course.
- Thanks.


698
00:49:19.260 --> 00:49:22.350
Hey, Danny, what is going on?

699
00:49:22.430 --> 00:49:24.880
Listen, I'm really, really sorry,
but I'm afraid our moving out plans


700
00:49:24.890 --> 00:49:27.120
are gonna have to be
put on hold just for a little while.


701
00:49:27.130 --> 00:49:29.190
- What do you mean? Why?
- I haven't got time to explain right now,


702
00:49:29.200 --> 00:49:32.027
but you know I wouldn't do this
unless I had a really good reason.


703
00:49:32.037 --> 00:49:35.607
- No. What's the reason?
- I can't explain right now. Okay.


704
00:49:44.180 --> 00:49:46.080
So you're the blackmailing prick.

705
00:49:47.450 --> 00:49:49.580
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
What are you doing with that?


706
00:49:49.650 --> 00:49:51.810
This is my manuscript.
This is not ready to be read by anyone.


707
00:49:51.820 --> 00:49:53.422
Well, you shouldn't leave it lying around,
Daniel,


708
00:49:53.432 --> 00:49:55.170
if you don't want people to read it.

709
00:49:55.190 --> 00:49:58.420
- This is my office!
- Guys, can we just get to the point?


710
00:49:58.600 --> 00:50:00.220
Fine by me.

711
00:50:03.870 --> 00:50:06.160
Fine. If I write you this check, okay,
that's the end of it. Yes?


712
00:50:06.170 --> 00:50:08.429
You give us the photos,
then you stay out of our lives forever,


713
00:50:08.439 --> 00:50:09.396
that's the deal, yeah?

714
00:50:09.410 --> 00:50:10.770
That's the deal.

715
00:50:27.460 --> 00:50:30.320
- Is that your first attempt?
- What?


716
00:50:30.390 --> 00:50:33.465
The novel.
That's your first novel, isn't it?


717
00:50:33.476 --> 00:50:34.500
Yeah. So?

718
00:50:34.660 --> 00:50:36.130
No, nothing.

719
00:50:37.300 --> 00:50:40.170
I tried writing once.
It didn't work for me, either.


720
00:50:41.800 --> 00:50:45.030
I think it's like a gift.
You either have it or you don't.


721
00:50:46.410 --> 00:50:50.610
It must be hard for you though, Daniel,
living up to your brother's reputation.


722
00:50:50.680 --> 00:50:54.050
You know, always living
in the shadow of a sibling like that.


723
00:50:54.650 --> 00:51:01.050
By the way, I read your latest novel.
Wow. Really good stuff.


724
00:51:01.820 --> 00:51:03.520
Thanks.

725
00:51:05.330 --> 00:51:07.120
Right, that's it.

726
00:51:08.000 --> 00:51:09.800
Daniel, what the hell are you doing?

727
00:51:09.870 --> 00:51:13.030
There's no way I'm giving this twat
a single penny of my money.


728
00:51:13.170 --> 00:51:16.900
- Don't be ridiculous.
- No. Why should I? Why should I?


729
00:51:16.970 --> 00:51:19.600
He comes in here on the day of our
father's funeral, tries to blackmail us,


730
00:51:19.610 --> 00:51:22.002
and then he slags off my novel.
Who does he think he is?


731
00:51:22.102 --> 00:51:24.711
- He has the photos.
- Let him show the photos, I don't care.


732
00:51:24.721 --> 00:51:27.540
- Daniel, it'll...
- No, Robert, I give up, okay? I give up.


733
00:51:27.610 --> 00:51:31.410
I can't take anymore. If that's what
he's gonna do, then fine. Let him do it.


734
00:51:34.350 --> 00:51:36.080
- Fine.
- Fine.


735
00:51:36.820 --> 00:51:42.350
- What? Wait, wait, wait, wait.
- Please, get out of my way.


736
00:51:42.430 --> 00:51:45.680
- Let's just discuss this a minute.
- There is nothing to discuss.


737
00:51:46.870 --> 00:51:50.460
- Get out of my way! Get off!
- We can talk about this.


738
00:51:54.110 --> 00:51:55.870
Get up, Daniel! Daniel!

739
00:51:56.080 --> 00:51:57.080
Listen...

740
00:51:57.840 --> 00:51:59.600
What are you doing, Robert?
What are you doing?


741
00:51:59.610 --> 00:52:01.740
- Just get some rope or something.
- Rope? What do you mean rope?


742
00:52:01.750 --> 00:52:02.940
I haven't got any rope.

743
00:52:03.020 --> 00:52:06.280
Get some cord or something.
There, from the curtain.


744
00:52:07.650 --> 00:52:09.710
- Okay, here you go.
- Grab his legs.


745
00:52:12.420 --> 00:52:15.330
Oh, God, Jesus Christ, Robert,
this is a really bad idea.


746
00:52:15.830 --> 00:52:21.600
Twinkle, twinkle, little star

747
00:52:57.500 --> 00:53:00.440
- Fucking men.
- Tell me about it.


748
00:53:01.570 --> 00:53:05.130
- Daniel, get that tie. Just get that tie.
- Why?


749
00:53:05.280 --> 00:53:07.070
What am I supposed
to do with a tie?

750
00:53:07.150 --> 00:53:08.700
Do you want everybody to know
our dad is a poof?


751
00:53:08.710 --> 00:53:10.884
- Of course I don't.
- Stuff it in his mouth, then.


752
00:53:10.894 --> 00:53:13.510
- This is ridiculous.
- Daniel, you know that cake...


753
00:53:13.590 --> 00:53:15.990
Jesus Christ, Howard.
Shut the fucking door!


754
00:53:16.050 --> 00:53:18.110
What's going on? Who's that?

755
00:53:18.190 --> 00:53:20.040
- He's having a fit.
- It's a seizure.


756
00:53:20.110 --> 00:53:23.160
Oh, God, really? I've just found
some Valium. Would that help?


757
00:53:23.320 --> 00:53:25.820
- Yeah, brilliant. Bring them here.
- How many?


758
00:53:25.900 --> 00:53:28.520
- I don't know, a handful.
- Really? Okay.


759
00:53:32.040 --> 00:53:33.870
Are they all in? Dropped one.

760
00:53:33.940 --> 00:53:38.030
Here. Open his mouth.
It's okay. It's all right.


761
00:53:38.680 --> 00:53:40.024
You haven't seen
a little brown pill bottle.


762
00:53:40.034 --> 00:53:40.834
Shut the door!

763
00:53:40.910 --> 00:53:43.440
Jesus Christ, Howard!
I told you to lock the fucking door!


764
00:53:43.510 --> 00:53:46.210
- You said, "Shut the fucking door."
- What's going on?


765
00:53:46.370 --> 00:53:49.740
- Oh, he's having a fit.
- A fit? Then why is he all tied up?


766
00:53:59.630 --> 00:54:02.620
Hello. Hello.

767
00:54:02.900 --> 00:54:04.360
Hang on, he's blackmailing you
over what?


768
00:54:04.370 --> 00:54:06.890
- It's not important right now.
- What do you mean it's not important?


769
00:54:06.900 --> 00:54:08.118
- It's personal.
- Well, why?


770
00:54:08.128 --> 00:54:09.960
He said it's personal. 
That's enough.

771
00:54:10.040 --> 00:54:12.345
Just trust us, okay?
This is not a good guy, you know.


772
00:54:12.415 --> 00:54:14.175
- We can explain later.
- So, what are we gonna do with him?


773
00:54:14.185 --> 00:54:16.840
- I don't know. What are we gonna do?
- I don't know.


774
00:54:16.910 --> 00:54:18.510
What do you mean you don't know?

775
00:54:18.580 --> 00:54:20.680
How long are we gonna keep him
tied up for?


776
00:54:20.840 --> 00:54:22.850
How long's the Valium gonna last?

777
00:54:22.920 --> 00:54:24.080
- What?
- Valium?


778
00:54:24.150 --> 00:54:26.520
- Yeah.
- Oh, yeah, I found those Valium.


779
00:54:26.590 --> 00:54:29.290
We gave him a few to calm him down.
Thank you.


780
00:54:29.960 --> 00:54:31.320
I think he's all right.

781
00:54:31.390 --> 00:54:34.120
- Oh, fuck!
- What?


782
00:54:36.200 --> 00:54:39.430
- What is it?
- Oh, fuck!


783
00:54:40.940 --> 00:54:42.130
What?

784
00:54:45.210 --> 00:54:50.230
- What? What?
- The thing is, it's not actually Valium.


785
00:54:50.310 --> 00:54:54.010
It's acid, mostly. A little ketamine.
Simon took one these by mistake,


786
00:54:54.080 --> 00:54:56.510
- that's why he's been off his box.
- What are you doing with this stuff?


787
00:54:56.520 --> 00:54:58.610
- They're for a friend!
- Hang on a minute.


788
00:54:58.690 --> 00:55:02.450
You're telling us that Martha's boyfriend,
who knocked over our father's coffin,


789
00:55:02.520 --> 00:55:03.890
had just one of these things?

790
00:55:03.960 --> 00:55:05.482
- And you gave him how many?
- Five.


791
00:55:05.492 --> 00:55:07.660
- Oh, Howard.
- What do you mean, "Oh, Howard"?


792
00:55:07.820 --> 00:55:10.260
- You cannot blame me for this!
- Poor bastard.


793
00:55:10.400 --> 00:55:11.618
We should call an ambulance.

794
00:55:11.648 --> 00:55:13.170
You can't do that. 
I'll be screwed!

795
00:55:13.180 --> 00:55:16.950
He's right. They're gonna turn up and find
that he's been force fed with hard drugs.


796
00:55:17.050 --> 00:55:19.377
- Well, what's gonna happen? Is he gonna die?
- Hmm?


797
00:55:19.470 --> 00:55:22.270
No. Shouldn't think so.

798
00:55:23.680 --> 00:55:25.140
Daniel?

799
00:55:28.120 --> 00:55:29.640
Robert?

800
00:55:30.320 --> 00:55:32.010
Be out in a minute, Mum.

801
00:55:32.120 --> 00:55:33.250
Daniel.

802
00:55:33.320 --> 00:55:36.980
- We need to go outside.
- You two stay here and look after him.


803
00:55:39.030 --> 00:55:40.390
Hang on, look after him?

804
00:55:40.460 --> 00:55:43.026
What do you mean look after him?
What are we supposed to do?


805
00:55:43.036 --> 00:55:46.266
Just make sure he doesn't escape.
Lock the door behind us.


806
00:55:46.770 --> 00:55:48.960
- Daniel?
- Hey, Mum. How's it going?


807
00:55:49.040 --> 00:55:50.290
Reverend Davidson needs to speak to you.

808
00:55:50.300 --> 00:55:53.040
We were wondering if we might be able
to resume the service now.


809
00:55:53.050 --> 00:55:55.040
Really, I'm only meant to be here
until 3:00.


810
00:55:55.120 --> 00:55:56.903
That's great, but we
need to have a chat.

811
00:55:56.914 --> 00:55:58.610
Would you give us another five minutes?

812
00:55:58.620 --> 00:56:00.332
- Sure.
- Is there a problem?


813
00:56:01.950 --> 00:56:03.040
Christ.

814
00:56:05.990 --> 00:56:08.510
Why didn't you just pay him
the fucking money?


815
00:56:10.120 --> 00:56:11.590
It's your fault.

816
00:56:15.060 --> 00:56:16.490
Where's my tea?

817
00:56:19.500 --> 00:56:23.030
- What's your problem?
- Women.


818
00:56:24.870 --> 00:56:30.330
Women, women, women.
Let me tell you something about women.


819
00:56:30.410 --> 00:56:34.370
When I was a young man, I used to go out
with the most beautiful woman


820
00:56:34.450 --> 00:56:39.110
in the village. I mean, she'd walk into
the room and everyone's eyes would turn.


821
00:56:39.180 --> 00:56:41.150
Everyone wanted to fuck her.

822
00:56:41.220 --> 00:56:44.210
And of course she liked the attention,
because...


823
00:56:45.890 --> 00:56:47.380
I need a shit.

824
00:56:52.960 --> 00:56:55.990
Shit, I can't believe
you gave him five!


825
00:56:56.070 --> 00:56:57.470
Don't blame me for this.

826
00:56:57.540 --> 00:57:00.236
Even if they were Valium,
you should never have given him five.


827
00:57:00.246 --> 00:57:03.146
- Don't you know anything?
- No, not about giving people...


828
00:57:08.210 --> 00:57:11.710
- Hello?
- I need the toilet.


829
00:57:13.220 --> 00:57:16.820
- Can you use the one upstairs?
- I'm in a wheelchair, you fucking idiot!


830
00:57:16.980 --> 00:57:21.220
How am I supposed to get up the stairs?
Open the door.


831
00:57:21.490 --> 00:57:23.390
Hang on a minute.

832
00:57:23.460 --> 00:57:25.560
What are we gonna do?
What are we gonna do?


833
00:57:25.720 --> 00:57:27.370
We'll stick him behind the couch.

834
00:57:27.970 --> 00:57:31.530
- Come on, quickly.
- Just looking for the key.


835
00:57:31.770 --> 00:57:34.600
Quick! Shut up!

836
00:57:37.610 --> 00:57:39.870
- Hurry up!
- Got it!


837
00:57:45.220 --> 00:57:49.080
- Hello.
- What the hell is wrong with you people?


838
00:57:49.950 --> 00:57:52.550
I'm about to shit in my trousers.
Come on!


839
00:57:55.590 --> 00:57:58.620
- Hey.
- Oh, Justin, what do you want?


840
00:57:58.700 --> 00:58:00.320
I just wanna talk to you.

841
00:58:00.400 --> 00:58:02.500
Please don't make me
go through this again.


842
00:58:02.660 --> 00:58:04.960
What are you so afraid of, Martha?

843
00:58:05.030 --> 00:58:07.430
I know you feel the same way.
You can't fight what we had together.


844
00:58:07.440 --> 00:58:09.940
Justin, it was one night!
It was a massive mistake.


845
00:58:10.100 --> 00:58:13.130
I was drunk out of my mind.
You could have been a donkey!


846
00:58:13.280 --> 00:58:15.490
What's this guy got that I don't have?

847
00:58:15.501 --> 00:58:18.220
Okay. Well for one thing,
he's responsible.


848
00:58:18.280 --> 00:58:22.880
He's thoughtful. He's intelligent.
He's stable. Is that enough for you?


849
00:58:36.060 --> 00:58:38.360
Will you stop making out
that this is all my fault.


850
00:58:38.430 --> 00:58:39.990
I'm not the one who attacked the guy
and tied him up.


851
00:58:40.000 --> 00:58:42.660
- Someone had to look out for Mum.
- I've been looking out for Mum


852
00:58:42.670 --> 00:58:44.453
ever since you disappeared off
to New York


853
00:58:44.463 --> 00:58:46.550
to gallivant around
with your celebrity friends.


854
00:58:46.710 --> 00:58:50.610
You really are unbelievable.
You just can't get over it, can you?


855
00:58:50.680 --> 00:58:53.150
- Get over what?
- You're burning with jealousy


856
00:58:53.210 --> 00:58:56.480
because you've just spent three years
working on a novel,


857
00:58:56.550 --> 00:58:58.840
- and you won't even let anyone see it.
- Why should I? Why should I?


858
00:58:58.850 --> 00:58:59.880
What're you gonna do?

859
00:58:59.950 --> 00:59:03.720
- Are you gonna wait until you're dead...
- Rather than just a hack writing pulp...


860
00:59:03.790 --> 00:59:07.182
and hope it's published posthumously?
Crap, self-righteously. Least my novel...


861
00:59:07.192 --> 00:59:10.242
- You're a pompous arsehole!
- And you are the most selfish...


862
00:59:10.340 --> 00:59:11.600
Daniel?

863
00:59:12.270 --> 00:59:15.130
Daniel, what is going on?
This is your father's funeral.


864
00:59:15.200 --> 00:59:19.530
- Not now, Jane. Jane, not now. Not now.
- Why are you acting like this?


865
00:59:22.210 --> 00:59:26.270
It's the flat, isn't it? It's the flat.
You don't want to go, do you?


866
00:59:26.350 --> 00:59:29.210
- You don't want to leave.
- Just tell her, Daniel.


867
00:59:29.280 --> 00:59:31.440
Just tell me what?

868
00:59:35.920 --> 00:59:39.980
Jane, you remember that short man
that I pointed out to you earlier?


869
00:59:40.060 --> 00:59:41.120
- Remember the short...
- Yeah.


870
00:59:41.130 --> 00:59:43.565
Well, it turns out that
he was having an affair with Dad,


871
00:59:43.625 --> 00:59:45.930
and now he's blackmailing us
into giving him £ 15,000,


872
00:59:45.940 --> 00:59:48.680
otherwise he's gonna show everyone
pictures of them doing stuff.


873
00:59:48.870 --> 00:59:50.600
- Sex stuff.
- Yeah.


874
00:59:52.640 --> 00:59:56.240
- Is this some sort of a sick joke?
- No, of course it's not a sick joke.


875
01:00:00.310 --> 01:00:02.300
Your dad was a gay?

876
01:00:02.910 --> 01:00:05.540
- Hurry up. Hurry up. Hurry up.
- I am.


877
01:00:05.950 --> 01:00:08.250
It's touch and go. Hurry up.

878
01:00:08.320 --> 01:00:10.450
- Quick, quick, quick!
- Give me that. Here.


879
01:00:10.520 --> 01:00:13.173
- Lift, lift. Help me, help me.
- All right. I am helping you.


880
01:00:13.183 --> 01:00:15.233
- Put your arms around me then.
- Lift me.


881
01:00:15.290 --> 01:00:18.630
Jesus Christ! Fucking hell!
You weigh a ton.


882
01:00:18.650 --> 01:00:19.450
You got me? You got me?

883
01:00:19.455 --> 01:00:20.955
Yes, I've got you. 
Of course I've got you.

884
01:00:20.970 --> 01:00:22.520
- Quickly, quickly.
- All right.


885
01:00:22.590 --> 01:00:25.990
- I'm trying to see where the toilet is.
- Now get the trousers down.


886
01:00:26.150 --> 01:00:30.100
- Fuck. No. You do it, I'll hold you.
- How can I do it? I'm handicapped!


887
01:00:30.170 --> 01:00:32.940
- Get them down. Get them down.
- Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!


888
01:00:33.010 --> 01:00:36.600
- Quick! Quick!
- I am! Right. Okay.


889
01:00:36.680 --> 01:00:42.710
Underpants. Move! Move!
Quick! Quick! It's touch and go!


890
01:00:42.790 --> 01:00:45.980
- Fuck! They're all down!
- It's touch and go. Am I there?


891
01:00:46.060 --> 01:00:47.990
- I don't know. Yes!
- Am I there?


892
01:00:48.060 --> 01:00:50.490
- Am I there? Are you sure?
- Yes. Sit down! Yes!


893
01:00:50.560 --> 01:00:55.160
Just sit down. Sit down.
Fuck, hang on, hang on.


894
01:00:55.230 --> 01:00:58.070
That's better.

895
01:01:07.680 --> 01:01:10.880
- Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
- Jesus, how much noise do you wanna...


896
01:01:11.040 --> 01:01:14.060
- Oh, God!
- Fucking hell! Fuck! Poo!


897
01:01:15.620 --> 01:01:17.710
Fucking hell!

898
01:01:23.360 --> 01:01:24.360
Howard.

899
01:01:24.890 --> 01:01:26.330
Fuck! Fuck!

900
01:01:26.530 --> 01:01:29.050
- Fucking get it off!
- Howard.


901
01:01:29.130 --> 01:01:31.680
Something, please, get it off! Get it off!

902
01:01:31.691 --> 01:01:32.540
Howard!

903
01:01:32.670 --> 01:01:37.830
- What? What?
- You've missed a bit.


904
01:01:42.810 --> 01:01:49.080
Oh, fuck! It's in my mouth!
Fucking hell! I'm gonna be sick!


905
01:01:50.720 --> 01:01:54.680
You'll have a lot more to worry about
than shit in your mouth if we get caught!


906
01:01:54.960 --> 01:01:57.410
- It's in my mouth!
- It's gone. Leave the tap on!


907
01:01:59.160 --> 01:02:02.030
I'm gonna be sick! I'm gonna be sick!
Please! Please!


908
01:02:15.440 --> 01:02:18.880
Check him. Touch him or something.
Check him.


909
01:02:19.780 --> 01:02:22.050
You all right, mate?

910
01:02:23.520 --> 01:02:24.640
Try it again.

911
01:02:26.750 --> 01:02:30.750
- Mate? Mate?
- Wake him up.


912
01:02:31.730 --> 01:02:34.990
- Mate? What's his name?
- I don't know.


913
01:02:36.460 --> 01:02:37.900
Try Philip.

914
01:02:46.540 --> 01:02:49.600
- Philip?
- Shake him.


915
01:02:54.280 --> 01:02:56.980
Philip? Wake up, mate.
You all right?


916
01:02:58.520 --> 01:02:59.520
Philip?

917
01:03:03.890 --> 01:03:09.490
Maybe it's not Philip.
Maybe it's something else. Pinch him.


918
01:03:09.560 --> 01:03:11.190
Please, just pinch him.

919
01:03:15.270 --> 01:03:16.390
Mate?

920
01:03:19.740 --> 01:03:22.070
Shit, I don't think he's breathing.

921
01:03:23.740 --> 01:03:24.770
What?

922
01:03:24.840 --> 01:03:27.940
No, he must be breathing,
he must be breathing.


923
01:03:40.360 --> 01:03:41.520
Shit!

924
01:03:42.600 --> 01:03:44.760
- Is he all right?
- No.


925
01:03:47.170 --> 01:03:48.260
He's fucking dead.

926
01:03:53.470 --> 01:03:55.860
That's it, then, isn't it? We're just
gonna have to give him our money.


927
01:03:55.870 --> 01:03:58.270
Well, it's not gonna be
quite as simple as that.


928
01:03:58.340 --> 01:03:59.370
Well, why not?

929
01:03:59.440 --> 01:04:02.440
Daniel refused to pay,
so now we're completely fucked.


930
01:04:02.510 --> 01:04:04.760
- Just shut up. Just shut up.
- What happened?


931
01:04:18.660 --> 01:04:21.560
Hi. Sorry. Thanks.

932
01:04:24.700 --> 01:04:27.070
Hi. Sorry, can I?

933
01:04:30.770 --> 01:04:32.940
Can I just come through? Thank you.

934
01:04:41.920 --> 01:04:44.220
What the hell are you
grinning at, Howard?


935
01:04:46.720 --> 01:04:51.250
Wonder if I could ask you two
to pop into the study for a second?


936
01:04:55.730 --> 01:04:58.220
- Back soon.
- Yeah, okay.


937
01:05:01.870 --> 01:05:03.240
It's Howard.

938
01:05:10.980 --> 01:05:14.040
Hey, Jesus, what's this? What's this?

939
01:05:15.490 --> 01:05:17.440
- Call Uncle Victor.
- There's no point.


940
01:05:17.600 --> 01:05:20.950
- What do you mean there's no point?
- Look at him. He's stone dead.


941
01:05:24.490 --> 01:05:28.190
- What the hell did you do to him?
- We didn't do anything.


942
01:05:28.260 --> 01:05:31.700
- He hit his head on the corner.
- He hit his head on the corner?


943
01:05:31.800 --> 01:05:35.360
He hit his head. That's what happened.
Why, what do you think happened?


944
01:05:35.440 --> 01:05:38.136
This is really, really bad.
This is really, really, really bad.


945
01:05:38.210 --> 01:05:39.440
What are we gonna do?

946
01:05:39.510 --> 01:05:42.250
- Actually, I've really got to go.
- You are not going anywhere.


947
01:05:42.260 --> 01:05:43.770
Listen, I cannot go to prison.

948
01:05:43.850 --> 01:05:46.900
Do you have any idea what they do
to blokes like me in prison?


949
01:05:47.080 --> 01:05:50.210
- I cannot go to prison.
- Howard, just calm down.


950
01:05:59.090 --> 01:06:03.390
Now, nobody here knows who this guy is,
right? They don't even know his name.


951
01:06:03.470 --> 01:06:05.660
They probably didn't even notice him.

952
01:06:05.730 --> 01:06:08.280
They didn't notice him?
He's four fucking feet tall!


953
01:06:08.740 --> 01:06:12.190
All right, so we just get rid of the
body. It's like he came and left.


954
01:06:12.910 --> 01:06:15.930
Let's get rid of the body?
What are you talking about?


955
01:06:16.010 --> 01:06:18.980
Look at us. What do we know about
getting rid of bodies?


956
01:06:19.050 --> 01:06:22.400
What are you gonna do? Are you gonna
throw him out with the rubbish?


957
01:06:23.950 --> 01:06:27.150
Did any of you happen to notice
the size of Uncle Eddie's coffin?


958
01:06:29.760 --> 01:06:32.690
Are you suggesting that we bury him
with my father?


959
01:06:33.490 --> 01:06:36.400
Why not? I mean,
it's not like he's gonna know, is he?


960
01:06:37.670 --> 01:06:39.460
That's not the point.

961
01:06:42.370 --> 01:06:45.810
You have to admit it makes
sense, Daniel. Coffin's there.


962
01:06:45.870 --> 01:06:49.270
Hole in the ground's there.
He'll be gone. Finished. End of story.


963
01:06:49.340 --> 01:06:52.610
Unless you've got a better suggestion.

964
01:07:03.190 --> 01:07:04.490
No, I mean, come on, look.

965
01:07:04.560 --> 01:07:08.060
I mean, you gotta do whatever it is
in life that fires you up the most.


966
01:07:08.220 --> 01:07:11.920
Yes, but maybe I don't consider life
anymore as being about me, me, me.


967
01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:15.750
Maybe I've discovered there's something
outside of myself that I care about,


968
01:07:15.910 --> 01:07:17.800
and maybe you should too, Justin.

969
01:07:17.870 --> 01:07:21.640
Hey, well, that's a bit harsh,
'cause, look, I mean, I care about you.


970
01:07:21.710 --> 01:07:23.700
No, Justin, you care about you.

971
01:07:23.780 --> 01:07:27.130
You care about me in relation to
how I affect you. There's a difference.


972
01:07:27.190 --> 01:07:27.990
Uh-uh.

973
01:07:28.050 --> 01:07:31.380
No, that's not true, Martha.

974
01:07:31.750 --> 01:07:35.210
Justin, I don't know
what else I need to tell you.


975
01:07:36.120 --> 01:07:38.370
- I love you, Martha.
- No, Justin, you don't.


976
01:07:43.400 --> 01:07:45.330
- Jesus fucking Christ!
- Simon!


977
01:07:46.500 --> 01:07:47.660
Simon!

978
01:07:48.400 --> 01:07:50.960
Simon! Simon,
what the hell are you doing?


979
01:07:51.040 --> 01:07:53.345
Get back in here
and put your clothes on this instant!


980
01:07:53.355 --> 01:07:56.640
- I saw you kissing him.
- I wasn't kissing him, I promise you.


981
01:07:56.710 --> 01:07:59.140
What are you doing?
We're at a bloody funeral!


982
01:07:59.210 --> 01:08:01.580
- I'll jump.
- Simon, don't be silly.


983
01:08:01.650 --> 01:08:03.689
I'm gonna jump right now, 
I swear to you!

984
01:08:03.700 --> 01:08:05.010
Don't be silly, Simon.

985
01:08:05.160 --> 01:08:07.950
Don't be silly.
Remember, you've got drugs in you.


986
01:08:08.020 --> 01:08:13.080
Just calm down. Simon, look at me. Justin,
will you get the fuck out of here?


987
01:08:13.290 --> 01:08:16.820
- Simon, please...
- No, I'm going to do it. I'm going...


988
01:08:17.800 --> 01:08:19.550
- Simon, look at me.
- I swear I am!


989
01:08:19.710 --> 01:08:21.960
Simon. Please, just calm down.
Simon, please.


990
01:08:22.030 --> 01:08:23.800
I'm gonna jump. 
I'm gonna jump.

991
01:08:24.300 --> 01:08:28.260
I'm going to jump. I'm going to jump.
I'm going to jump!


992
01:08:29.310 --> 01:08:32.070
- This is impossible. We cannot do it.
- Just shut up.


993
01:08:32.140 --> 01:08:33.300
Howard? Is that you?

994
01:08:34.540 --> 01:08:36.240
- Shit!
- Howard, are you in there?


995
01:08:36.310 --> 01:08:37.310
Yeah.

996
01:08:38.180 --> 01:08:42.740
Quick, get him in the bathroom.
You've gotta move the table.


997
01:08:43.490 --> 01:08:44.680
Howard?

998
01:08:50.660 --> 01:08:52.360
- Oh, shit!
- What's that?


999
01:08:53.800 --> 01:08:56.235
Howard, what the fuck
is Uncle Alfie doing on the toilet?


1000
01:08:56.300 --> 01:08:58.460
- I forgot.
- How could you forget?


1001
01:08:58.540 --> 01:09:01.800
- What is wrong with you?
- Open the bloody door.


1002
01:09:03.140 --> 01:09:04.510
- What is it?
- Hey, Daniel.


1003
01:09:04.580 --> 01:09:05.980
- Where's Howard?
- I'm here.


1004
01:09:06.140 --> 01:09:09.740
Howard, come see this.
Simon's totally fucking lost it.


1005
01:09:12.620 --> 01:09:14.280
- What's going on?
- Nothing.


1006
01:09:14.350 --> 01:09:17.620
Listen, Simon's on the roof.
He's totally fucking starkers,


1007
01:09:17.690 --> 01:09:20.180
- and he's threatening to jump.
- Oh, Christ!


1008
01:09:20.260 --> 01:09:22.610
- Where are you going?
- I have to go out there.


1009
01:09:22.770 --> 01:09:26.000
- If he jumps, I'm fucked!
- Wait here.


1010
01:09:27.530 --> 01:09:29.000
Come on, hurry up.

1011
01:09:35.540 --> 01:09:37.470
Simon,
you are not going to jump.


1012
01:09:37.540 --> 01:09:40.270
No, I'm not listening to you.

1013
01:09:40.340 --> 01:09:42.810
Simon, get back in here.

1014
01:09:43.780 --> 01:09:46.270
Simon, come inside,
we'll have a cup of tea.


1015
01:09:46.780 --> 01:09:50.880
- No!
- Simon! Simon!


1016
01:09:52.820 --> 01:09:55.480
Simon? Simon?

1017
01:09:57.890 --> 01:09:59.160
Simon?

1018
01:10:05.700 --> 01:10:06.830
Simon!

1019
01:10:06.900 --> 01:10:09.170
Martha! What the hell are you doing?

1020
01:10:09.940 --> 01:10:10.940
Simon!

1021
01:10:13.310 --> 01:10:14.900
Stay there.

1022
01:10:16.710 --> 01:10:17.740
Martha!

1023
01:10:18.880 --> 01:10:19.910
Get down from there!

1024
01:10:23.150 --> 01:10:24.680
- What's happening?
- I think I can get rid of this guy,


1025
01:10:24.690 --> 01:10:27.690
but I need you to stay outside
and make sure nobody comes in.


1026
01:10:27.850 --> 01:10:28.850
Okay.

1027
01:10:29.490 --> 01:10:30.490
Martha!

1028
01:10:35.660 --> 01:10:37.790
- Who is it?
- It's Daniel. Let me in.


1029
01:10:38.030 --> 01:10:41.080
Everyone's in the garden.
Quick, we have to move the body now!


1030
01:10:41.240 --> 01:10:42.240
Brilliant.

1031
01:10:46.510 --> 01:10:48.700
Okay. Quick. Quick.

1032
01:10:48.780 --> 01:10:51.380
Howard, Howard, stay here.
Make sure no one comes in.


1033
01:10:51.540 --> 01:10:53.660
Okay, okay.

1034
01:10:55.280 --> 01:10:57.880
Hello, Reverend. Hi. Hi.

1035
01:10:58.890 --> 01:11:00.910
How is God today?

1036
01:11:07.790 --> 01:11:10.090
- God, he's a funny one, isn't he?
- Excuse me.


1037
01:11:10.250 --> 01:11:11.840
Yeah, okay. I'm sorry.

1038
01:11:12.700 --> 01:11:15.400
Daniel, we have to do this right.

1039
01:11:20.340 --> 01:11:23.384
I just wanted to ask you about religion
and how I could become a priest


1040
01:11:23.410 --> 01:11:26.106
if I wanted to, because I've seen
you today and you're amazing.


1041
01:11:26.116 --> 01:11:27.736
I'm delighted to hear that.

1042
01:11:28.080 --> 01:11:30.710
Oh, God, we can't leave him like that.

1043
01:11:35.760 --> 01:11:38.717
You know, in a strange way, maybe
this is what Dad would have wanted.


1044
01:11:38.727 --> 01:11:41.677
For God's sake, Robert,
can you not take anything seriously?


1045
01:11:41.837 --> 01:11:44.490
On Sundays, is it true

1046
01:11:44.560 --> 01:11:48.430
that wine is sweeter?

1047
01:11:50.070 --> 01:11:52.940
- Or not?
- Listen, we'll deal with this later on.


1048
01:11:53.010 --> 01:11:55.470
- I need to get to the phone.
- Yeah, but...


1049
01:11:57.980 --> 01:11:59.600
Why do you say
I can't take anything seriously?


1050
01:11:59.610 --> 01:12:02.340
I'll tell you why. Because you disappear
halfway around the world


1051
01:12:02.350 --> 01:12:04.240
without hardly ever coming back
to see your parents.


1052
01:12:04.250 --> 01:12:06.880
Because you spend your last remaining
money on a first-class plane ticket


1053
01:12:06.890 --> 01:12:08.910
when you know you were supposed
to give me half for the funeral.


1054
01:12:08.920 --> 01:12:10.980
And because you live your life
like you're on a fairground ride,


1055
01:12:10.990 --> 01:12:12.890
and because you have never, ever, ever

1056
01:12:13.050 --> 01:12:15.380
given a shit about anybody
except yourself.


1057
01:12:15.760 --> 01:12:19.060
No one's doing anything about this
disturbed young man on the roof.


1058
01:12:19.220 --> 01:12:22.400
I have a confession to make.
I have these thoughts about


1059
01:12:22.470 --> 01:12:26.400
- pushing a pen up my bum!
- I beg your pardon?


1060
01:12:27.410 --> 01:12:32.710
Simon, this is really dangerous.
Please.


1061
01:12:33.310 --> 01:12:37.340
- I saw you.
- Stay there.


1062
01:12:53.060 --> 01:12:57.870
You know, I'll never be good enough.

1063
01:12:58.970 --> 01:13:03.670
Not for your dad, not for you. I'll never
be rich enough. I'll never be cool enough.


1064
01:13:03.740 --> 01:13:06.500
Simon, stop talking this nonsense
and just come inside.


1065
01:13:06.580 --> 01:13:08.670
No, you go back inside!

1066
01:13:08.750 --> 01:13:10.740
- Come with me.
- No. Why?


1067
01:13:15.090 --> 01:13:17.520
Because we're gonna have a baby.

1068
01:13:21.430 --> 01:13:22.690
What?

1069
01:13:23.830 --> 01:13:26.990
We're gonna have a child together.

1070
01:13:31.770 --> 01:13:32.960
You're pregnant?

1071
01:13:33.040 --> 01:13:35.970
And I won't be able
to do it without you.


1072
01:14:02.930 --> 01:14:05.380
- What's that? Excuse me.
- I don't know. Go look.


1073
01:14:11.670 --> 01:14:13.140
Bye, Dad.

1074
01:14:25.020 --> 01:14:27.510
We're gonna have a baby!

1075
01:14:29.520 --> 01:14:31.750
Jesus Christ!

1076
01:14:37.670 --> 01:14:39.860
Hey, everyone, 
Simon's off the roof!

1077
01:14:41.440 --> 01:14:43.030
I'm going to kill him.

1078
01:14:56.320 --> 01:14:59.510
- Hey, has he gone?
- Yeah.


1079
01:14:59.590 --> 01:15:01.920
Thank God.

1080
01:15:03.990 --> 01:15:05.720
Careful, careful.

1081
01:15:08.830 --> 01:15:11.390
- Thank you.
- Martha.


1082
01:15:11.500 --> 01:15:13.830
Martha, will you open this door?

1083
01:15:17.100 --> 01:15:22.200
Thank God you're safe. You idiot!
What were you thinking?


1084
01:15:22.280 --> 01:15:24.570
I want you to stay away
from my daughter.


1085
01:15:24.650 --> 01:15:26.700
- Look, Dad...
- Martha, stay out of this.


1086
01:15:26.860 --> 01:15:29.140
- Dad, we're getting married.
- You're what?


1087
01:15:29.220 --> 01:15:31.980
We're getting married.

1088
01:15:33.590 --> 01:15:37.550
Martha, you don't have to marry this man
just because you're pregnant.


1089
01:15:37.620 --> 01:15:41.420
- We can deal with this, Martha.
- I'm marrying him because I love him.


1090
01:15:41.930 --> 01:15:43.660
- You can't.
- Yes, I can.


1091
01:15:43.730 --> 01:15:45.680
This is my life,
and this is my choice,

1092
01:15:45.840 --> 01:15:49.330
and I'm sorry if you don't like it,
but that's just tough.


1093
01:15:50.570 --> 01:15:54.770
And I will tell you something else.
If you don't sort out your attitude,


1094
01:15:54.840 --> 01:15:58.610
you're gonna end up
a very lonely, bitter old man.


1095
01:15:59.780 --> 01:16:01.750
- Simon.
- All right.


1096
01:16:05.490 --> 01:16:06.580
Dad!

1097
01:16:09.490 --> 01:16:12.750
Oh, darling,
we really must start again now.


1098
01:16:12.830 --> 01:16:15.850
- Daniel, have you seen Uncle Alfie?
- Shit!


1099
01:16:29.800 --> 01:16:32.400
- What the hell is going on in there?
- I'm so sorry.


1100
01:16:32.480 --> 01:16:35.524
Never mind that. What about that
dead body you were dragging over here?


1101
01:16:35.534 --> 01:16:37.380
- What dead body?
- Oh, don't fuck with me!


1102
01:16:37.450 --> 01:16:40.250
- I saw a dead body!
- Uncle Alfie must have dropped off.


1103
01:16:40.410 --> 01:16:44.090
Get me the hell off of
this fucking toilet!


1104
01:16:44.620 --> 01:16:45.920
Here they come.

1105
01:16:55.770 --> 01:16:57.430
Did you hear that? 
She's having a kid.

1106
01:16:57.500 --> 01:16:59.590
I never would've done anything
if I'd known she was having a kid.


1107
01:16:59.600 --> 01:17:01.166
I thought you were in love with her.

1108
01:17:01.176 --> 01:17:03.500
Yeah, but can you imagine me
bringing up a kid?


1109
01:17:03.570 --> 01:17:05.240
- No.
- Exactly.


1110
01:17:05.310 --> 01:17:07.960
- How's your skin thing?
- Oh, that. Probably nothing.


1111
01:17:08.120 --> 01:17:12.120
To be honest, I'm more concerned about
having had Uncle Alfie's shit in my mouth.


1112
01:17:23.160 --> 01:17:25.750
The door opened, I saw him.
He was dead.


1113
01:17:25.830 --> 01:17:30.030
Why won't you listen?
I tell you, I saw the guy. He was dead.


1114
01:17:30.100 --> 01:17:32.570
I know you did, Uncle Alfie.
We all did.


1115
01:17:32.640 --> 01:17:34.830
No, no, no, in the bathroom.

1116
01:17:34.910 --> 01:17:36.160
The door opened. I saw...

1117
01:17:36.320 --> 01:17:38.700
I can't believe what a nightmare
today has been.


1118
01:17:38.780 --> 01:17:41.130
- It's been sort of exciting, hasn't it?
- What?


1119
01:17:41.200 --> 01:17:44.300
- For a funeral, I mean, it's been...
- Listen, about the flat,


1120
01:17:44.460 --> 01:17:46.975
I promise that I will make the call.
I will.


1121
01:17:46.986 --> 01:17:48.270
We'll work it out.

1122
01:17:49.590 --> 01:17:51.380
Right, we're really going to have to
whiz through this now.


1123
01:17:51.390 --> 01:17:52.510
Sure, let's go.

1124
01:17:52.590 --> 01:17:54.721
- Do you want to have the casket open...
- No. No.


1125
01:17:54.731 --> 01:17:55.720
Fine. That's fine.

1126
01:17:55.790 --> 01:17:59.090
Right. Sit down, everybody.
As quick as you can. We're ready to go.


1127
01:17:59.360 --> 01:18:03.090
Come along. Come on, come on.
Come on. Right.


1128
01:18:04.400 --> 01:18:08.390
Quickly! Come on, come on,
come on, come on.


1129
01:18:09.410 --> 01:18:12.240
Come on, come on, come on!

1130
01:18:13.880 --> 01:18:16.840
Well, I'd like to apologize on behalf of
the family for all of the distractions.


1131
01:18:16.850 --> 01:18:19.370
I hope that everyone is settled
and ready to continue with the service,


1132
01:18:19.380 --> 01:18:21.859
and Daniel would like to say
a few words about his father.


1133
01:18:21.869 --> 01:18:24.099
Off you go, Daniel. Quickly.

1134
01:18:40.070 --> 01:18:43.970
"My father was an exceptional man."

1135
01:19:04.360 --> 01:19:07.850
"My father was an exceptional man."

1136
01:19:18.070 --> 01:19:21.970
"He was born in 1938, just a year before
the war, and I'll never forget the..."


1137
01:19:25.210 --> 01:19:28.180
- What the hell is going on?
- There's someone in there!


1138
01:19:28.250 --> 01:19:29.980
I knew it!

1139
01:19:39.160 --> 01:19:42.250
What the hell are you doing
in my dad's coffin?


1140
01:19:44.760 --> 01:19:47.860
- Edward!
- No! No!


1141
01:19:48.100 --> 01:19:49.570
No!

1142
01:19:49.640 --> 01:19:52.300
Edward! Edward!

1143
01:19:57.510 --> 01:19:59.380
No!

1144
01:20:12.430 --> 01:20:15.860
You little bastard!
He's been shagging you, you bastard.


1145
01:20:18.800 --> 01:20:20.230
Oh, dear God!

1146
01:20:20.570 --> 01:20:23.260
My father was an exceptional man!

1147
01:20:47.690 --> 01:20:52.390
He may not have been a perfect man,
but he was a good man.


1148
01:20:54.430 --> 01:20:55.800
And he loved us.

1149
01:21:01.040 --> 01:21:04.090
All I wanted to do today was to give him
a dignified send-off.


1150
01:21:04.250 --> 01:21:06.280
Is that really so much to ask?

1151
01:21:12.120 --> 01:21:13.120
So...

1152
01:21:15.990 --> 01:21:17.250
Maybe...

1153
01:21:19.690 --> 01:21:25.320
Maybe he had some things he liked to do.
Life isn't simple. It's complicated.


1154
01:21:28.470 --> 01:21:34.700
We're all just thrown in here together
in a world full of chaos and confusion,


1155
01:21:36.010 --> 01:21:40.880
a world full of questions and no answers.
Death always lingering around the corner.


1156
01:21:40.940 --> 01:21:42.540
And we do our best.

1157
01:21:45.180 --> 01:21:49.310
We can only do our best,
and my dad did his best.


1158
01:22:02.230 --> 01:22:04.760
He always tried to tell me that you
have to go for what you want in life,


1159
01:22:04.770 --> 01:22:07.370
because you never know
how long you're gonna be here.


1160
01:22:07.530 --> 01:22:11.200
And whether you succeed or you fail,

1161
01:22:11.270 --> 01:22:14.070
the most important thing
is to have tried.


1162
01:22:16.550 --> 01:22:19.050
A parent can only guide you
in the right direction.


1163
01:22:19.210 --> 01:22:22.040
In the end, you have
to learn for yourself.


1164
01:22:26.660 --> 01:22:28.850
You have to grow up yourself.

1165
01:22:34.760 --> 01:22:36.860
So when you all leave here today,

1166
01:22:38.300 --> 01:22:42.130
I would like you to remember my father
for who he really was,


1167
01:22:43.870 --> 01:22:46.900
a decent, loving man.

1168
01:22:51.580 --> 01:22:55.710
If only we could be as giving
and as generous and as


1169
01:22:55.780 --> 01:23:02.020
understanding as my father was, then
the world would be a far better place.


1170
01:23:41.860 --> 01:23:44.830
Hey. How's Mum doing?

1171
01:23:46.830 --> 01:23:48.600
She'll survive.

1172
01:23:52.040 --> 01:23:55.200
On the positive side,
now she knows why it's been so long


1173
01:23:55.280 --> 01:23:57.000
since she and Dad had sex.

1174
01:24:01.920 --> 01:24:04.910
I asked her to come to New York with me
for a while.


1175
01:24:05.390 --> 01:24:08.820
Give you and Jane a chance
to breathe a bit, you know.


1176
01:24:09.460 --> 01:24:13.360
- Get your flat.
- Wow.


1177
01:24:13.960 --> 01:24:14.960
Wow.

1178
01:24:16.860 --> 01:24:22.100
That was a pretty good speech you gave,
by the way. It was really


1179
01:24:27.070 --> 01:24:30.800
- impressive.
- Thanks.


1180
01:24:35.920 --> 01:24:40.750
Maybe when you've got time, you
wouldn't mind taking a look at my novel.


1181
01:24:41.290 --> 01:24:44.280
I'd love to, yeah.

1182
01:24:47.730 --> 01:24:49.630
Hey. Hey.

1183
01:24:51.600 --> 01:24:53.760
I'm exhausted, actually.

1184
01:24:53.830 --> 01:24:57.020
Uncle Alfie keeps going on
about the body in the bathroom.


1185
01:24:57.050 --> 01:24:58.900
I think it's best
if he stays here tonight.


1186
01:24:58.910 --> 01:24:59.710
Yeah.

1187
01:24:59.720 --> 01:25:02.850
- Do you think he'll be okay?
- Yeah. Yeah, he'll be fine.


1188
01:25:02.910 --> 01:25:05.710
I found him a couple of Valium,
put him to bed.


1189
01:25:09.250 --> 01:25:12.080
Everything's so fucking green!

1190
01:25:33.470 --> 01:25:35.130
And keep rolling.

1191
01:25:35.970 --> 01:25:37.700
What was that?

1192
01:25:44.950 --> 01:25:46.610
Cut, print, check it.

1193
01:25:53.320 --> 01:25:58.060
- That is so low. That's so low.
- What? Come on! You said cut!


1194
01:25:58.700 --> 01:26:02.150
Daniel, have... 
Oh, you bastard!

1195
01:26:03.100 --> 01:26:04.570
Jane Asher! Sorry.

1196
01:26:07.240 --> 01:26:10.100
Do that... Do that again, sorry.
Do that again, sorry.


1197
01:26:13.610 --> 01:26:16.580
Cut. Check it.
Very nice, though, guys.


1198
01:26:20.820 --> 01:26:22.790
Print. Check it.

1199
01:26:24.920 --> 01:26:28.580
Cut! Cut. Print it.

1200
01:26:30.760 --> 01:26:32.820
That was very good.

1201
01:26:34.760 --> 01:26:36.990
Anything else
you wanna do, Peter?


1202
01:26:37.470 --> 01:26:38.660
That's a cut.

1203
01:26:39.800 --> 01:26:40.890
Check it.
