2
00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:18.570
enough

3
00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:22.510
enough

4
00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.900
enough

5
00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:30.840
That's it Billy

6
00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:35.280
Billy that's it

7
00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:53.180
Billy...

8
00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:54.180
Good work Billy

9
00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:55.590
Wait a minute

10
00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:56.240
Hold it

11
00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.410
Now let's have some quiet
Hold it


12
00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:58.320
Now let's have some quiet

13
00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:01.630
That was a good gimmick Morgan
that kiss of death gag


14
00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:03.920
Oh, that's not a gimmick gentlemen

15
00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:06.830
I mean Billy Kiss is sincerely
interested in his fellow men


16
00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:11.150
These are just sudden impulses of love
that take hold of him


17
00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:13.870
I'm glad it's taken hold of him
rather than him take hold of me


18
00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:17.570
Was it one of those
sudden impulses of love


19
00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:19.400
That killed that man in Atlanta last year?

20
00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:21.430
Oh, no...
That was just an accident gentlemen


21
00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:23.930
I mean Billy Kiss just squeezed
a little too hard


22
00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:26.910
The man was just too brittle

23
00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:29.170
What about you Kiss what do you think?

24
00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:33.070
All I can say is, I'll be the last man
standing when it's all over


25
00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:34.320
in that town in Texas

26
00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:37.640
What about the...

27
00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:39.530
Another time, another time

28
00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:45.490
And that was the killer you will enter into
the Battle Creek brawl


29
00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:47.190
You save me the trouble

30
00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:50.290
Count it Maxim

31
00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:51.420
You needn't

32
00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:53.180
Good day

33
00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:59.590
I told you we shouldn't have stacked
them up against Kiss


34
00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:00.650
We learned something

35
00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:02.590
And it cost us 25 "g's"

36
00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:04.980
Just make your rounds David
Do your job


37
00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:46.960
Show off

38
00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:56.370
Hey, Batman! Come on

39
00:04:56.660 --> 00:04:59.170
We have to go see your brother
about the money


40
00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:00.840
It's time

41
00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:02.550
In a minute

42
00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:05.680
Ten more of those and you won't be
able to go tonight


43
00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:11.020
Hey! Is your brother still gonna marry
that girl from China?


44
00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:12.380
Pretty soon

45
00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:14.410
Even though they've never met?

46
00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:19.720
That's not unusual... for Chinese

47
00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:21.750
But they've only written to each other

48
00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:24.020
Ten thousand times

49
00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:27.330
Well it's a pretty strange way
to fall in love


50
00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:29.620
Licking stamps!

51
00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:11.370
Protect me from what?

52
00:06:11.470 --> 00:06:13.550
What you say I
need, I do not need

53
00:06:13.910 --> 00:06:16.210
There's not enough money to
pay my wages


54
00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:18.650
Sometimes they work hard for nothing

55
00:06:20.450 --> 00:06:22.670
I hate 'Chinks' that whine

56
00:06:24.010 --> 00:06:25.990
You are playing it too poor Kwan

57
00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:28.270
Go, go

58
00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:31.330
Get out of here

59
00:06:34.890 --> 00:06:35.830
Right here John

60
00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:38.010
Put his hand right here

61
00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:45.610
Count

62
00:06:46.030 --> 00:06:47.740
Count your fingers

63
00:06:48.420 --> 00:06:55.140
1... 2... 3... 4... 5

64
00:06:55.230 --> 00:06:56.040
Good

65
00:06:56.340 --> 00:06:58.290
You're doing really good with English

66
00:06:58.870 --> 00:07:02.120
Maybe next time you won't have
five fingers to count


67
00:07:03.910 --> 00:07:07.750
When you pickup a meat cleaver
you'd better be ready to use it


68
00:07:21.810 --> 00:07:23.440
They beat your father

69
00:07:25.020 --> 00:07:26.870
Dad, are you okay?

70
00:07:29.420 --> 00:07:30.870
Take care of him Nancy

71
00:07:31.490 --> 00:07:32.800
No...

72
00:07:38.830 --> 00:07:39.640
Hey!

73
00:07:50.200 --> 00:07:52.350
This place is my father's

74
00:07:53.470 --> 00:07:55.350
You hurt him

75
00:07:55.640 --> 00:07:57.380
Yeah, well he's okay

76
00:07:57.470 --> 00:07:59.890
Maybe just a little bit smart

77
00:08:03.140 --> 00:08:04.120
Jerry

78
00:08:04.580 --> 00:08:06.560
Jerry, you must not fight

79
00:08:29.930 --> 00:08:33.080
Jerry, you must not fight

80
00:08:40.100 --> 00:08:41.900
You must not hit anybody

81
00:08:42.010 --> 00:08:43.680
You promised me

82
00:08:44.070 --> 00:08:44.940
Jerry

83
00:08:45.410 --> 00:08:47.490
You promised your dead mother

84
00:09:09.820 --> 00:09:12.940
Jerry, you are fighting

85
00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:05.830
What is this?

86
00:10:05.920 --> 00:10:06.840
Jerry

87
00:10:49.490 --> 00:10:50.780
'Chink' bastard

88
00:10:58.830 --> 00:10:59.690
Are you all together?

89
00:10:59.790 --> 00:11:00.840
One piece

90
00:11:01.860 --> 00:11:03.140
Was it the same bunch?

91
00:11:03.230 --> 00:11:04.040
Yeah

92
00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:08.820
Take care, Dad's pretty upset

93
00:11:22.410 --> 00:11:25.010
One day they will get tired of
coming here


94
00:11:25.110 --> 00:11:25.880
Maybe

95
00:11:25.970 --> 00:11:28.350
It is my will against theirs

96
00:11:28.440 --> 00:11:29.880
You go up and take a nap

97
00:11:29.980 --> 00:11:31.390
I'll wash the dishes

98
00:11:31.980 --> 00:11:33.860
Will you be here this evening?

99
00:11:34.220 --> 00:11:36.000
I'm going to the race tonight

100
00:11:36.180 --> 00:11:39.200
A cash prize, $25

101
00:11:41.820 --> 00:11:44.800
Yes you need it for car payments

102
00:11:45.220 --> 00:11:46.160
Nancy

103
00:11:46.250 --> 00:11:49.460
Don't let Jerry go down the street
to his uncle's place


104
00:11:49.560 --> 00:11:51.350
It is very bad for him

105
00:11:51.460 --> 00:11:52.770
You can stop him

106
00:11:52.860 --> 00:11:54.550
He will listen to you

107
00:11:55.130 --> 00:11:57.280
All that fighting

108
00:11:57.660 --> 00:11:59.230
Training Dad

109
00:11:59.330 --> 00:12:01.170
Training for what?

110
00:12:03.300 --> 00:12:06.070
And my brother has never been worthy

111
00:12:06.170 --> 00:12:08.280
He's a fine chiropractor

112
00:12:08.670 --> 00:12:10.670
Your brother is the doctor

113
00:12:10.770 --> 00:12:12.810
Your uncle is a bone cracker

114
00:12:12.900 --> 00:12:15.060
And you could have been a doctor too

115
00:12:15.210 --> 00:12:16.180
Two years

116
00:12:16.270 --> 00:12:18.120
Such a waste

117
00:12:18.240 --> 00:12:21.620
It just didn't happen fast enough for me
Dad


118
00:12:22.450 --> 00:12:25.260
But you have time for all these things

119
00:12:26.420 --> 00:12:28.080
There's plenty of 'wonton'

120
00:12:28.180 --> 00:12:30.360
Get something hot in the stomach

121
00:12:30.450 --> 00:12:32.740
And take a clean handkerchief

122
00:12:36.960 --> 00:12:41.470
Hey, I know a way you can
double your money... on every dollar


123
00:12:49.760 --> 00:12:52.340
You need money
to enter that roller race


124
00:12:52.430 --> 00:12:53.810
Four bucks

125
00:12:55.040 --> 00:12:56.690
Double my money back?

126
00:12:57.500 --> 00:12:59.130
We'll chew'em up

127
00:13:09.380 --> 00:13:11.890
Oh! thank you

128
00:13:12.440 --> 00:13:15.180
Oh! I feel relieved

129
00:13:15.280 --> 00:13:17.580
Marvelous

130
00:13:17.690 --> 00:13:23.440
You have such marvelous hands
such strength


131
00:14:02.380 --> 00:14:03.400
Jerry

132
00:14:06.450 --> 00:14:07.740
On the square

133
00:16:35.920 --> 00:16:36.670
Get up

134
00:16:39.210 --> 00:16:40.520
Get up

135
00:17:41.490 --> 00:17:44.580
Sometimes you make me tremble
with disgust


136
00:17:45.730 --> 00:17:46.730
I'm sorry uncle

137
00:17:46.820 --> 00:17:48.710
I have but one pupil

138
00:17:48.820 --> 00:17:52.380
Because there is no one else
worth teaching except you


139
00:17:53.360 --> 00:17:54.650
You have a chance

140
00:17:55.240 --> 00:17:56.610
Yes, a chance

141
00:17:57.200 --> 00:17:59.110
Does your father know that
you are here?


142
00:17:59.370 --> 00:18:01.750
I told him that
I was going to the race


143
00:18:02.170 --> 00:18:02.910
Are you?

144
00:18:03.010 --> 00:18:04.190
Yes, but later

145
00:18:06.040 --> 00:18:07.190
To your father

146
00:18:07.800 --> 00:18:11.780
May he have toothache for
every grain of rice he sold today


147
00:18:11.880 --> 00:18:16.390
Ah, you cannot accept that
even in fun


148
00:18:16.750 --> 00:18:19.530
You love him despite his
foolish demands


149
00:18:19.750 --> 00:18:23.160
May his tea hold the sweetest leaves

150
00:18:49.390 --> 00:18:51.620
It will be interesting to hear
David's story


151
00:18:52.730 --> 00:18:56.050
When a man has no sons
and only one nephew


152
00:18:56.170 --> 00:18:58.550
He has to do the best he can

153
00:18:58.640 --> 00:19:02.730
I told your foolish sister
not to marry that Leggetti


154
00:19:03.010 --> 00:19:04.680
Now, now Mum

155
00:19:04.780 --> 00:19:06.660
At least David has the ambition

156
00:19:07.080 --> 00:19:09.920
I'm going to have to make a decision
by myself


157
00:19:12.780 --> 00:19:13.750
Well John

158
00:19:13.850 --> 00:19:14.930
We heard

159
00:19:15.210 --> 00:19:16.660
Not important

160
00:19:17.020 --> 00:19:18.330
I admire you

161
00:19:21.290 --> 00:19:23.070
John wants to kill him

162
00:19:23.250 --> 00:19:25.410
Him, the old Chinese

163
00:19:25.920 --> 00:19:28.440
No, the young one. The son

164
00:19:29.390 --> 00:19:30.890
Why would you want to do that?

165
00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:32.500
I want that 'chink'

166
00:19:32.590 --> 00:19:33.830
He don't fight right

167
00:19:33.930 --> 00:19:36.410
Are you saying
there was only one man?


168
00:19:36.600 --> 00:19:39.080
We assumed there was
a gang of Chinese


169
00:19:39.430 --> 00:19:40.780
But you David

170
00:19:40.970 --> 00:19:43.970
I would think that you'd be anxious
to break the young man's head


171
00:19:44.070 --> 00:19:45.480
I was on the corner

172
00:19:45.900 --> 00:19:47.740
I can still find him if you want

173
00:19:47.840 --> 00:19:51.290
You couldn't find a whore on Rush Street

174
00:19:51.540 --> 00:19:53.180
Now, now Grandmamma

175
00:19:53.270 --> 00:19:56.660
Don't Grandmamma me you lazy fart

176
00:19:56.940 --> 00:19:58.650
I think you'd better find him David

177
00:19:58.750 --> 00:19:59.990
He beat three of your men

178
00:20:00.080 --> 00:20:03.580
Including John here
and John isn't that easy


179
00:20:03.680 --> 00:20:05.470
Go out of your way to stop him

180
00:20:05.820 --> 00:20:07.290
Test him severely

181
00:20:07.790 --> 00:20:11.710
John, I don't want that boy killed

182
00:20:12.550 --> 00:20:13.810
Right David!

183
00:20:17.020 --> 00:20:19.440
You should have written it down for him

184
00:20:21.560 --> 00:20:24.980
Now Mum, you never know

185
00:20:25.530 --> 00:20:27.680
We may have found somebody

186
00:20:42.780 --> 00:20:46.530
Two minutes and counting

187
00:21:31.610 --> 00:21:32.240
Hey

188
00:21:32.580 --> 00:21:34.480
Hey, let's just skate. Hey, Jerry

189
00:21:34.570 --> 00:21:36.730
Hey, no harm, no fun

190
00:21:46.380 --> 00:21:50.500
What I want you to do
is take care of my friend Jerry there


191
00:21:54.180 --> 00:21:56.310
Alright, alright

192
00:22:08.800 --> 00:22:10.050
Give us the lead

193
00:22:10.200 --> 00:22:12.450
I'm gonna skate the crap
out of this place


194
00:23:49.630 --> 00:23:51.410
Get out of my way

195
00:24:23.350 --> 00:24:24.440
Throw it

196
00:24:32.400 --> 00:24:33.540
Creep

197
00:24:43.230 --> 00:24:44.070
Get out of the way

198
00:24:44.170 --> 00:24:44.800
What are you doing?

199
00:24:44.800 --> 00:24:45.770
Hey don't push me

200
00:24:45.870 --> 00:24:48.380
Come on, come on

201
00:24:55.910 --> 00:25:00.330
We have 'em breaking bones over here

202
00:26:53.320 --> 00:26:55.610
There's a fight over here

203
00:27:02.160 --> 00:27:03.070
Hold this

204
00:29:48.030 --> 00:29:49.330
25 bucks

205
00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:51.010
I love you

206
00:29:51.300 --> 00:29:52.310
Thanks Jug

207
00:29:52.400 --> 00:29:54.670
Hey Jug, we can drive you home?

208
00:29:54.770 --> 00:29:56.510
Nah, I'm too excited to sit

209
00:29:56.610 --> 00:29:58.440
But you can take my stuff home
Okay


210
00:29:58.530 --> 00:29:59.170
Okay

211
00:29:59.200 --> 00:30:00.590
See you later

212
00:30:01.140 --> 00:30:02.800
Listen don't do anything I wouldn't do

213
00:31:07.310 --> 00:31:08.230
John

214
00:33:03.190 --> 00:33:04.810
To be superior

215
00:33:05.230 --> 00:33:07.350
One must be pure

216
00:33:07.460 --> 00:33:12.480
Body, as well as mind

217
00:33:13.060 --> 00:33:17.850
This is essential to gain harmony
with one's soul


218
00:33:29.610 --> 00:33:32.420
It's about time you start meditation

219
00:33:49.290 --> 00:33:50.200
Hi kid

220
00:34:03.600 --> 00:34:05.080
Just a minute

221
00:34:09.610 --> 00:34:11.090
Here, sit down

222
00:34:14.480 --> 00:34:16.490
How'd the race go?

223
00:34:17.040 --> 00:34:19.350
I won $25

224
00:34:19.440 --> 00:34:21.790
Great, congratulations

225
00:34:21.880 --> 00:34:23.120
I double your money

226
00:34:23.220 --> 00:34:24.160
Nice

227
00:34:27.010 --> 00:34:28.450
Doctor, Doctor

228
00:34:28.540 --> 00:34:29.490
Hurry

229
00:34:52.270 --> 00:34:53.410
He's alive

230
00:34:53.740 --> 00:34:56.600
Christ! They look like razor cuts

231
00:34:56.700 --> 00:34:57.750
I'll get my car

232
00:34:58.000 --> 00:34:59.450
We'll take him to the clinic

233
00:35:05.900 --> 00:35:06.920
They're here

234
00:35:13.240 --> 00:35:14.960
You stupid fool

235
00:35:15.670 --> 00:35:18.170
Why did you hire those big guys
that kill?


236
00:35:18.550 --> 00:35:20.060
You're a slow learner

237
00:35:20.620 --> 00:35:22.760
How many times
did I get you out of jail?


238
00:35:23.020 --> 00:35:24.400
How many times?

239
00:35:24.760 --> 00:35:26.560
New clothes, new cars

240
00:35:26.650 --> 00:35:27.730
I gave you responsibility

241
00:35:27.820 --> 00:35:29.480
You don't know how to handle it

242
00:35:30.020 --> 00:35:31.740
All you know is the one thing

243
00:35:32.460 --> 00:35:36.340
Somebody outta take your wand out
and step on it


244
00:35:36.830 --> 00:35:38.550
It's okay I took his wallet

245
00:35:38.760 --> 00:35:41.950
It had $25 in
The police will think it's a robbery


246
00:35:44.040 --> 00:35:45.120
Get out

247
00:35:45.740 --> 00:35:47.740
I don't want to
see you for a while

248
00:35:47.830 --> 00:35:49.720
I don't know what I'd do
if I see you too soon


249
00:35:50.440 --> 00:35:51.810
You stay here John

250
00:35:53.910 --> 00:35:58.410
This Kwan kid handles himself
very well


251
00:35:58.510 --> 00:36:00.010
Actually he don't fight right

252
00:36:00.100 --> 00:36:01.460
He fights foreign

253
00:36:02.800 --> 00:36:04.830
I want to see him myself

254
00:36:05.050 --> 00:36:07.350
How about the Woo brothers?

255
00:36:07.440 --> 00:36:12.530
Those little yellow bastards fight like
a pack of foreign devils


256
00:36:13.780 --> 00:36:15.100
Mama's right

257
00:36:15.480 --> 00:36:17.040
Set it up, will you John?

258
00:36:19.550 --> 00:36:21.070
Oh look! Here's that fight thing

259
00:36:23.690 --> 00:36:26.300
Here's that Pittsburg fighter
He's going to Texas


260
00:36:26.390 --> 00:36:29.980
Yes, and his boss Morgan is a gangster

261
00:36:37.040 --> 00:36:37.670
Hello

262
00:36:37.770 --> 00:36:38.370
Kwan

263
00:36:38.370 --> 00:36:38.400
Are you the son, Jerry?
Kwan


264
00:36:38.400 --> 00:36:40.440
Are you the son, Jerry?

265
00:36:40.740 --> 00:36:41.580
Yes

266
00:36:41.860 --> 00:36:44.920
For a few bucks I can tell you about
your friend Jug


267
00:36:45.030 --> 00:36:46.520
How he got beat up

268
00:36:46.870 --> 00:36:48.820
It wasn't no robbery

269
00:36:49.670 --> 00:36:50.830
What do I do?

270
00:36:51.110 --> 00:36:53.760
I'll meet you at the Outdoor Theatre
in two hours


271
00:36:53.980 --> 00:36:56.660
Oh yeah
Don't bring anybody with you


272
00:36:57.380 --> 00:36:58.990
Okay, I...

273
00:37:03.750 --> 00:37:05.060
Who was that?

274
00:39:19.330 --> 00:39:20.130
Hi Dad

275
00:39:21.770 --> 00:39:23.550
I know what you have been doing

276
00:39:23.640 --> 00:39:24.560
Fighting

277
00:39:25.310 --> 00:39:27.290
I will bet you have not eaten

278
00:39:27.810 --> 00:39:28.450
Don't move

279
00:39:28.480 --> 00:39:29.170
What

280
00:39:36.880 --> 00:39:38.830
All I felt was a little wind

281
00:39:39.520 --> 00:39:40.960
You're very quick

282
00:39:41.050 --> 00:39:42.370
And accurate

283
00:39:43.150 --> 00:39:44.730
Indeed amazing

284
00:39:44.860 --> 00:39:46.540
What can you do with that?

285
00:39:46.730 --> 00:39:47.630
Kicking?

286
00:39:47.730 --> 00:39:48.910
Depends on myself

287
00:39:49.760 --> 00:39:51.480
Is there a great need for that?

288
00:39:52.020 --> 00:39:53.110
Sometimes

289
00:39:53.220 --> 00:39:54.580
It's an art too

290
00:39:55.360 --> 00:39:57.830
After your done with this training

291
00:39:57.940 --> 00:40:00.310
How do you support yourself with
this skill?


292
00:40:00.930 --> 00:40:04.970
How do you charge to defend yourself?

293
00:40:05.070 --> 00:40:07.340
You don't believe that it has value

294
00:40:07.430 --> 00:40:10.480
I'm only trying to understand
what you do with this


295
00:40:10.570 --> 00:40:11.950
Maybe I'll be a teacher

296
00:40:13.140 --> 00:40:16.950
This will be yours
It is something real


297
00:40:17.610 --> 00:40:20.520
And paying gangsters
to keep your doors open?


298
00:40:20.610 --> 00:40:24.600
I will not pay them
and you will not either


299
00:40:26.650 --> 00:40:27.360
Jug?

300
00:40:27.450 --> 00:40:29.470
Still the same Jerry

301
00:40:30.020 --> 00:40:33.140
Well Mae's arriving two days early

302
00:40:33.280 --> 00:40:35.550
The steam ship company notified me
the pier number


303
00:40:35.660 --> 00:40:36.670
Oh my!

304
00:40:37.320 --> 00:40:39.060
I won't be able to go meet her

305
00:40:39.150 --> 00:40:40.260
Can you go Jerry?

306
00:40:40.360 --> 00:40:41.110
When?

307
00:40:41.490 --> 00:40:42.330
Today

308
00:40:42.560 --> 00:40:43.530
Today!

309
00:40:43.630 --> 00:40:47.240
I've got rail tickets waiting for you and
Mae at the Chicago North Western


310
00:40:47.830 --> 00:40:49.500
There's nothing to stop you

311
00:40:49.600 --> 00:40:51.750
You're the only one
who has nothing to do


312
00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:52.870
Okay

313
00:40:53.870 --> 00:40:55.250
When does it leave?

314
00:40:55.540 --> 00:40:56.480
In an hour

315
00:40:56.640 --> 00:40:57.820
In an hour!

316
00:40:58.570 --> 00:40:59.450
Jerry

317
00:40:59.570 --> 00:41:01.400
The name of the boat
and pier number is in there


318
00:41:01.510 --> 00:41:02.750
Also where to pick

319
00:41:02.840 --> 00:41:03.890
up the train tickets

320
00:41:04.040 --> 00:41:05.190
Get a taxi

321
00:41:06.080 --> 00:41:07.590
There's one out on the street

322
00:41:08.050 --> 00:41:09.050
Call Nancy

323
00:41:09.140 --> 00:41:10.490
Tell her what is going on

324
00:41:11.110 --> 00:41:13.030
Take a clean handkerchief

325
00:41:18.580 --> 00:41:20.620
I have to get to the railroad station
Straight away


326
00:41:20.720 --> 00:41:21.790
Chicago Western?

327
00:41:21.880 --> 00:41:22.640
Yep

328
00:41:26.950 --> 00:41:29.360
It just so happens I know just
where that is


329
00:41:29.450 --> 00:41:30.980
Go, go, go, go

330
00:41:37.160 --> 00:41:37.840
Keep the change

331
00:41:37.930 --> 00:41:38.880
Thanks

332
00:41:39.270 --> 00:41:42.780
The city of San Francisco is about half
way through the station on your left


333
00:41:42.940 --> 00:41:45.190
Good luck with that girl coming in
from China


334
00:41:52.980 --> 00:41:55.110
Ah, that smells wonderful

335
00:41:55.210 --> 00:41:56.630
Yes

336
00:41:58.770 --> 00:41:59.410
Hello

337
00:41:59.440 --> 00:42:00.510
You wouldn't believe it

338
00:42:00.610 --> 00:42:02.150
I didn't even have to follow him

339
00:42:02.250 --> 00:42:03.720
He jumped right in the cab

340
00:42:03.810 --> 00:42:06.110
I got everything except his
morning mark


341
00:42:06.210 --> 00:42:06.840
Like what?

342
00:42:06.920 --> 00:42:09.330
Like he's going to San Francisco
to pick up some girl


343
00:42:09.420 --> 00:42:12.140
That's gonna marry his brother
Got her name, everything


344
00:42:13.180 --> 00:42:13.900
Good

345
00:42:14.080 --> 00:42:15.320
Come on in and
tell me all about it

346
00:42:15.420 --> 00:42:18.680
I'll catch a plane to the coast
get there one day ahead of them


347
00:42:18.890 --> 00:42:20.970
That's very interesting about the girl

348
00:42:21.420 --> 00:42:22.710
Could be useful

349
00:42:32.500 --> 00:42:35.910
So, you are Jerry

350
00:42:37.870 --> 00:42:39.440
Robert wrote a great deal about you

351
00:42:39.530 --> 00:42:41.720
You hit people, is that not true?

352
00:42:44.400 --> 00:42:45.670
I'm so happy

353
00:42:45.770 --> 00:42:47.850
It is wonderful to be in America

354
00:42:49.320 --> 00:42:50.400
Stop that thief!

355
00:42:52.180 --> 00:42:53.560
You could have stopped him

356
00:43:33.200 --> 00:43:34.220
You saw that girl

357
00:43:34.570 --> 00:43:35.750
Where did she go?

358
00:43:35.840 --> 00:43:38.530
Yeah I did Jerry,
but we'll need to talk

359
00:43:39.010 --> 00:43:40.160
Sit down

360
00:43:40.740 --> 00:43:41.960
She's safe

361
00:43:42.180 --> 00:43:43.830
But we still have to talk

362
00:43:49.720 --> 00:43:50.620
Beautiful day

363
00:43:52.650 --> 00:43:53.890
A bottle of Chablis, Harry

364
00:43:53.980 --> 00:43:57.320
And some of those wonderful
finger sandwiches that you make


365
00:43:57.420 --> 00:43:58.270
Yes Sir

366
00:44:03.090 --> 00:44:05.110
I've looked forward to meeting you
Jerry


367
00:44:06.590 --> 00:44:08.160
Now, I can see that you're worried

368
00:44:08.260 --> 00:44:11.870
And to that end, let me reassure you
the young lady is just fine


369
00:44:11.960 --> 00:44:14.620
She is having lunch at the moment
and eating heartily


370
00:44:14.760 --> 00:44:16.110
What are you after?

371
00:44:16.300 --> 00:44:18.320
I like that

372
00:44:18.600 --> 00:44:20.420
Straight away no nonsense

373
00:44:20.600 --> 00:44:24.380
Alright, you know the way Uncle Sam
sticks his finger out of the poster


374
00:44:24.470 --> 00:44:26.320
And says, 'I want you'

375
00:44:26.730 --> 00:44:28.470
Well, that's me Jerry I want you

376
00:44:28.570 --> 00:44:30.910
You're a great fighter Great

377
00:44:31.010 --> 00:44:33.010
Did you ever hear of Battle Creek Texas?

378
00:44:33.110 --> 00:44:34.760
There is going to be a fight there

379
00:44:35.110 --> 00:44:37.160
A very large and expensive fight

380
00:44:37.440 --> 00:44:39.260
I wanted a man of mine to participate

381
00:44:39.350 --> 00:44:42.920
But unfortunately he was severely
beaten recently


382
00:44:43.020 --> 00:44:45.050
I am not a man of yours

383
00:44:45.150 --> 00:44:47.440
Have you forgotten the young lady
so soon?


384
00:44:47.920 --> 00:44:49.210
Now my proposal is simple

385
00:44:49.590 --> 00:44:51.530
The fight is three weeks away

386
00:44:51.620 --> 00:44:54.600
We'll pay your entry fee
and take care of the expenses


387
00:44:54.690 --> 00:44:57.990
The young lady remains in my possession
until the winner is announced


388
00:44:58.090 --> 00:44:59.530
I'm betting it'll be you

389
00:44:59.630 --> 00:45:02.680
You'll have to return to Chicago immediately
to begin training


390
00:45:03.060 --> 00:45:06.300
There is no way I can go back
without the girl


391
00:45:06.400 --> 00:45:08.980
I couldn't face my family, my brother

392
00:45:09.160 --> 00:45:11.480
It's a disgrace that I've lost her

393
00:45:12.040 --> 00:45:14.220
I recognize that and I want to help

394
00:45:14.340 --> 00:45:16.410
I don't want
your concentration diminished


395
00:45:16.500 --> 00:45:19.940
After all, the thought that your brother is
waiting your return must be maddening


396
00:45:20.040 --> 00:45:22.490
And then having to come home
empty handed


397
00:45:22.610 --> 00:45:24.160
Now Mae and I have been talking

398
00:45:24.480 --> 00:45:27.420
It appears that she and your brother
have never actually met


399
00:45:27.520 --> 00:45:29.480
They've just exchanged pictures

400
00:45:29.580 --> 00:45:30.500
Hi guys

401
00:45:33.420 --> 00:45:38.120
We brought Miss Wong in from one of
our businesses here in San Francisco


402
00:45:38.220 --> 00:45:40.510
You mean fake this girl for Mae?

403
00:45:40.620 --> 00:45:41.600
Why not?

404
00:45:41.820 --> 00:45:44.080
It will relieve the pressure on you
and your brother


405
00:45:44.190 --> 00:45:49.760
A hoax, yes, but a humanitarian gesture
to ease the pain


406
00:45:49.860 --> 00:45:51.370
He will never buy it

407
00:45:51.470 --> 00:45:53.840
Mae is an educated classy girl

408
00:45:54.130 --> 00:45:56.110
She's even a trained nurse

409
00:45:56.500 --> 00:46:01.510
Miss Wong took first aid in high school
and she's studied life saving techniques


410
00:46:01.600 --> 00:46:03.890
Under a life guard last summer

411
00:46:04.100 --> 00:46:06.220
Mouth to mouth and all that

412
00:46:06.700 --> 00:46:08.650
She's been briefed on the situation

413
00:46:09.110 --> 00:46:10.910
It's a terrible disgrace

414
00:46:11.010 --> 00:46:15.850
If you don't go home soon your family
will have the police looking for you


415
00:46:16.850 --> 00:46:20.420
If I win, I keep the $15,000

416
00:46:20.520 --> 00:46:21.520
Absolutely

417
00:46:21.610 --> 00:46:25.880
And if I win you keep your men away
from my father's restaurant


418
00:46:25.980 --> 00:46:28.110
Or any place in the neighborhood

419
00:46:28.560 --> 00:46:30.160
How's that for a gentleman!

420
00:46:30.250 --> 00:46:30.930
Beautiful

421
00:46:31.030 --> 00:46:31.990
You've got it

422
00:46:32.090 --> 00:46:32.920
Forever

423
00:46:33.020 --> 00:46:34.110
Forever

424
00:46:43.770 --> 00:46:45.140
Here we go

425
00:46:48.100 --> 00:46:49.820
I'll wait here

426
00:47:16.450 --> 00:47:18.070
Get rid of the gum

427
00:47:38.500 --> 00:47:39.720
Dad, they're here

428
00:47:40.900 --> 00:47:42.110
Jerry, hi

429
00:47:42.200 --> 00:47:44.890
I think we'll never see the girl again
Gee, we were starting to get worried


430
00:47:47.510 --> 00:47:48.290
Mae

431
00:47:49.270 --> 00:47:50.790
Your bride to be

432
00:47:54.880 --> 00:47:58.380
Finally, my god finally

433
00:47:58.480 --> 00:48:01.140
Mae, this is my father

434
00:48:01.590 --> 00:48:03.020
Hi Dad

435
00:48:04.240 --> 00:48:07.980
Mae Chan welcome to our home

436
00:48:08.520 --> 00:48:10.240
We are very happy

437
00:48:12.620 --> 00:48:15.030
You two have a lot to talk over

438
00:48:15.480 --> 00:48:16.780
I'll see you later

439
00:48:28.500 --> 00:48:29.840
What do you think Uncle?

440
00:48:33.670 --> 00:48:38.940
I could make a guess
Robert's fiance is here in Chicago


441
00:48:39.510 --> 00:48:42.960
Dominici would not let her
get far from his side


442
00:48:43.270 --> 00:48:46.210
He has a big place in Lake Forest

443
00:48:46.310 --> 00:48:49.050
I guess it's stupid to suggest the police

444
00:48:49.140 --> 00:48:52.080
Stupid? No Wise? Yes

445
00:48:52.180 --> 00:48:55.120
If it is known that
Jerry has gone to the police


446
00:48:55.210 --> 00:48:57.400
I think we'll never see the girl again

447
00:48:58.080 --> 00:48:59.930
I have to try for her

448
00:49:00.960 --> 00:49:01.680
We

449
00:49:01.990 --> 00:49:04.100
'We' meaning the three of us

450
00:49:05.720 --> 00:49:10.940
That would be unwise and stupid

451
00:50:31.680 --> 00:50:33.830
Just keep on walking
the way you are going


452
00:50:47.860 --> 00:50:48.520
Hold it

453
00:50:49.250 --> 00:50:50.280
Wait a second

454
00:51:14.140 --> 00:51:14.780
Get 'em

455
00:51:22.210 --> 00:51:22.890
Try to get inside

456
00:51:29.550 --> 00:51:30.160
Behind you!

457
00:51:30.630 --> 00:51:31.160
I know

458
00:52:07.580 --> 00:52:08.150
Hey!

459
00:52:22.200 --> 00:52:23.000
Come on, come on

460
00:53:19.670 --> 00:53:20.910
Wonderful Jerry, Wonderful

461
00:53:21.450 --> 00:53:22.720
Come on into the living room

462
00:53:22.980 --> 00:53:25.750
Oh yes! Beautiful

463
00:53:40.120 --> 00:53:41.100
I knew you'd come here

464
00:53:41.660 --> 00:53:43.700
You'd have disappointed
if you hadn't tried


465
00:53:44.370 --> 00:53:45.500
I know she's here

466
00:53:45.700 --> 00:53:46.670
I want to see her

467
00:53:46.930 --> 00:53:49.700
I honestly believed that
we'd reached an agreement


468
00:53:49.930 --> 00:53:52.240
And here you are
trying to change everything


469
00:53:52.400 --> 00:53:55.040
My nephew doesn't know
if she's dead or alive


470
00:53:56.940 --> 00:53:58.140
He's very upset

471
00:53:59.370 --> 00:54:00.680
Well that's terrible

472
00:54:01.210 --> 00:54:03.190
Jerry shouldn't have to worry like this

473
00:54:03.450 --> 00:54:06.280
His mind should be free to train

474
00:54:07.480 --> 00:54:09.390
His opponents are going to be
quite formidable


475
00:54:10.020 --> 00:54:15.190
Billy Kiss from Pittsburg has entered
and another fellow from Morocco


476
00:54:15.750 --> 00:54:19.570
We're putting a lot of faith
not to say money


477
00:54:20.190 --> 00:54:22.570
In Jerry's ability
to win this thing in Texas


478
00:54:25.260 --> 00:54:28.400
I'm sorry Gentlemen
I can't grant your request


479
00:54:28.670 --> 00:54:29.800
But let me tell you this

480
00:54:30.040 --> 00:54:31.770
The young lady is quite well

481
00:54:32.000 --> 00:54:33.410
And in very good spirits

482
00:54:33.710 --> 00:54:36.010
A wonderful lively girl

483
00:54:42.040 --> 00:54:44.250
We have a fine gym
if you care to use it


484
00:54:44.450 --> 00:54:45.510
Completely equipped

485
00:54:46.280 --> 00:54:48.390
No!... you sure?

486
00:54:49.210 --> 00:54:51.530
Well if you need anything
please allow us to help


487
00:54:56.990 --> 00:54:59.730
It is best that you stay with me
during your training


488
00:54:59.990 --> 00:55:00.430
I will set

489
00:55:00.690 --> 00:55:01.360
up a cot

490
00:55:34.180 --> 00:55:36.390
Senor Leggetti, Mr. Morgan

491
00:55:37.380 --> 00:55:40.090
Come on kid, sit down

492
00:55:41.330 --> 00:55:42.200
How are you doing?

493
00:55:43.090 --> 00:55:43.830
Fine

494
00:55:44.950 --> 00:55:47.730
You know David
Pittsburg's not so far away


495
00:55:48.400 --> 00:55:51.300
We hear things, rumors

496
00:55:52.300 --> 00:55:53.110
Like what?

497
00:55:53.600 --> 00:55:54.770
A 'Chinaman'

498
00:55:56.370 --> 00:55:58.680
Lot's of 'Chinks' Which one?

499
00:55:58.970 --> 00:56:01.210
My boy Billy Kiss is very, very good

500
00:56:01.440 --> 00:56:05.580
But we've heard good things about
this 'Chinaman' that your uncle found


501
00:56:07.370 --> 00:56:08.370
He's alright

502
00:56:09.420 --> 00:56:11.110
Your uncle picks a lot of winners

503
00:56:11.650 --> 00:56:13.750
I don't like that
It worries me


504
00:56:13.950 --> 00:56:16.490
And worry puts wrinkles in my forehead

505
00:56:16.850 --> 00:56:18.060
I could take him

506
00:56:20.160 --> 00:56:21.750
Straight up or in an alley?

507
00:56:24.130 --> 00:56:25.490
Anywhere

508
00:56:27.030 --> 00:56:31.300
Yeah, I understand that your uncle's
been picking on you


509
00:56:31.670 --> 00:56:35.230
That he's been pushing you off
to one side


510
00:56:40.540 --> 00:56:43.140
I am family

511
00:56:43.210 --> 00:56:46.910
That's right
and you don't treat family like dirt


512
00:56:47.540 --> 00:56:52.920
I mean the Leggetti side of the family
is as legitimate as the Dominici side


513
00:56:53.180 --> 00:56:55.050
What is right, is right

514
00:56:56.790 --> 00:57:00.430
I'd be lying if I said I haven't been
thinking about that


515
00:57:00.660 --> 00:57:04.400
I mean what the hell
You're the rightful heir


516
00:57:05.360 --> 00:57:11.360
You help us, and I help you

517
00:57:12.130 --> 00:57:16.500
Pittsburg, Chicago, together

518
00:57:17.800 --> 00:57:19.370
I could like that

519
00:57:22.770 --> 00:57:27.310
That's fine, fine to everything
We'll talk some more


520
00:57:38.910 --> 00:57:40.150
It stinks

521
00:57:43.420 --> 00:57:44.590
Let's get out of here

522
00:57:49.090 --> 00:57:50.660
Ah, you must want to hate this

523
00:58:04.170 --> 00:58:09.120
So, everything is not as it seems
Your training has begun


524
00:58:09.580 --> 00:58:14.110
Every time you make a mistake this
brute will sleep with you in your small cot


525
01:00:15.170 --> 01:00:16.550
You are ready for Texas

526
01:01:35.710 --> 01:01:41.490
At the conclusion of the National Anthem
and at the sound of the siren


527
01:01:41.980 --> 01:01:45.980
You may do battle with anyone you wish

528
01:01:46.240 --> 01:01:50.820
When the bell tolls up there
in the courthouse


529
01:01:51.460 --> 01:01:59.960
Those of you who are still fit will be
paired off for the individual finals


530
01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:07.500
You know they can't use no guns
knives or hardware like that


531
01:05:30.200 --> 01:05:32.670
Stop 'em I say
right now. Stop the fight


532
01:05:41.070 --> 01:05:41.950
We're still in it

533
01:05:42.330 --> 01:05:44.710
Which is more than can be said
for most of them


534
01:05:46.310 --> 01:05:50.180
Don't walk Jerry, come, run with me
Cool off by warming up


535
01:05:52.580 --> 01:05:58.220
The first bout will be between Billy Kiss
of the United States and


536
01:05:58.450 --> 01:06:00.920
Buster Murphy of Jamaica

537
01:06:02.220 --> 01:06:04.700
Jerry looks very good doesn't he?
Mr. Leggetti


538
01:06:08.130 --> 01:06:09.330
Across the street there

539
01:06:14.930 --> 01:06:18.380
We don't want Morgan to surprise us
do we? David!


540
01:06:47.290 --> 01:06:49.070
Hey, you can't do that!

541
01:07:35.900 --> 01:07:45.900
"Kiss, Kiss, Kiss, Kiss, Kiss"

542
01:07:51.140 --> 01:07:53.940
I'm gonna kiss you goodbye tonight

543
01:08:38.710 --> 01:08:41.190
Next on the agenda
Ladies and Gentlemen


544
01:08:41.620 --> 01:08:51.620
Is a contest between Les Harris,
and from the city of Chicago, Jerry Kwan


545
01:08:53.190 --> 01:08:54.490
I mean Kwan

546
01:08:57.700 --> 01:09:05.440
Jerry

547
01:11:24.450 --> 01:11:25.450
Beautiful

548
01:11:29.050 --> 01:11:30.050
Hey! Where's Leggetti?

549
01:11:30.450 --> 01:11:33.020
Ah, I saw him go sneaking

550
01:11:34.920 --> 01:11:35.920
Left without a word

551
01:11:36.280 --> 01:11:37.520
Ah, it doesn't matter

552
01:11:39.120 --> 01:11:41.650
Morgan must be one worried bastard

553
01:11:44.230 --> 01:11:45.160
David Leggetti

554
01:11:45.400 --> 01:11:47.030
Yeah, yeah let him in

555
01:11:49.730 --> 01:11:50.870
We have to talk over here

556
01:11:52.540 --> 01:11:53.770
My uncle can see us from his room

557
01:11:54.130 --> 01:11:55.840
Yeah well I'm getting creases
in my forehead


558
01:11:56.070 --> 01:11:57.170
Your gonna have to drop a bomb
on that Chinaman...


559
01:11:57.370 --> 01:11:59.180
I can put a stop around the 'Chink'

560
01:11:59.970 --> 01:12:02.320
All I need is a little help
a few of your men


561
01:12:03.040 --> 01:12:05.950
Also I need someone to tell the uncle

562
01:12:08.150 --> 01:12:09.280
Sure Davy Boy

563
01:12:10.550 --> 01:12:12.250
I mean that's what partners are for, right

564
01:12:12.410 --> 01:12:20.840
The next match is between Aaron Johnson
of Liberia and Kyro Atashi of Japan


565
01:12:24.230 --> 01:12:30.500
Jerry...

566
01:12:30.700 --> 01:12:33.230
Jerry, you're a guy who's new
to this Battle Creek Brawl


567
01:12:33.470 --> 01:12:35.870
Nobody knows much about you
What do you think your chances are?


568
01:12:36.100 --> 01:12:38.980
I believe in myself
Some others believe in me


569
01:12:39.410 --> 01:12:42.380
$15,000 is a lot of money these days

570
01:12:42.580 --> 01:12:43.850
So what do you plan to do with it
if you win?


571
01:12:44.080 --> 01:12:46.020
I'm going to give it to my brother
in Chicago


572
01:12:46.280 --> 01:12:49.620
He has a clinic and he needs equipment
and all of that


573
01:12:50.010 --> 01:12:51.390
No one can argue with that

574
01:12:51.650 --> 01:12:54.530
Let's get back to action
Thank you Jerry Kwan


575
01:13:22.370 --> 01:13:25.180
The Jamaican fellow is dead
Kiss killed him


576
01:13:26.580 --> 01:13:27.350
An accident?

577
01:13:29.380 --> 01:13:30.110
Maybe

578
01:13:52.630 --> 01:13:54.160
Johnson is resourceful

579
01:13:54.570 --> 01:13:55.340
Vicious

580
01:13:55.770 --> 01:13:57.250
Then there's Billy Kiss

581
01:13:57.470 --> 01:13:58.410
I love it

582
01:13:58.570 --> 01:13:59.840
Come on let's run to the hotel

583
01:14:00.700 --> 01:14:06.880
Next fight at eight tonight
Aaron Johnson versus Jerry Kwan


584
01:14:35.930 --> 01:14:37.570
Come on Jerry

585
01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:19.270
Tomorrow the final bout between
Billy Kiss the man mountain of Pittsburg


586
01:17:19.490 --> 01:17:22.170
Against that amazing young man
from Chicago, Jerry Kwan


587
01:17:22.370 --> 01:17:25.140
It should be a
derby, the man mountain Kiss

588
01:17:25.370 --> 01:17:26.970
Against the little guy
with the windmill like moves


589
01:17:27.210 --> 01:17:29.610
How do you describe it? I'm in full view
Coast to Coast,


590
01:17:29.770 --> 01:17:31.110
tomorrow here from Battle Creek

591
01:17:31.500 --> 01:17:33.850
All right, we, we did it

592
01:17:41.280 --> 01:17:41.920
Jerry

593
01:17:42.350 --> 01:17:43.010
Herbert

594
01:17:44.480 --> 01:17:47.230
Nancy, what are you doing in there?

595
01:17:47.410 --> 01:17:48.520
I'm playing nurse

596
01:17:48.880 --> 01:17:50.230
Jerry's in the shower

597
01:17:51.720 --> 01:17:52.360
Let me in

598
01:17:52.590 --> 01:17:57.120
I can't, Jerry said nobody could come in
But nobody


599
01:17:57.330 --> 01:17:59.860
He must get to bed
He must sleep


600
01:18:00.560 --> 01:18:03.440
Don't worry
that's exactly what he's going to do


601
01:18:03.630 --> 01:18:05.000
As soon as I
put some bandages on him

602
01:18:06.540 --> 01:18:07.310
I will wait

603
01:18:21.450 --> 01:18:22.080
Sit here

604
01:18:29.250 --> 01:18:30.750
This won't take long

605
01:18:34.220 --> 01:18:37.030
Hey! You need to get some sleep

606
01:18:38.190 --> 01:18:40.130
We'll do some 'nice nice'

607
01:18:40.460 --> 01:18:42.170
Remember Billy Kiss

608
01:18:42.400 --> 01:18:42.870
Hey!

609
01:18:44.630 --> 01:18:46.790
Jerry, I can't get you ready this way

610
01:18:46.960 --> 01:18:48.280
I am ready this way

611
01:18:48.740 --> 01:18:50.830
Ah, no...

612
01:18:52.440 --> 01:18:56.580
Jerry...

613
01:19:02.370 --> 01:19:10.820
Waiting by a locked door while an open door
beckons is most foolish and futile


614
01:19:12.380 --> 01:19:16.190
Honest, you hear me

615
01:19:54.320 --> 01:20:02.130
Folks it's fifteen minutes until the final
bout between Billy Kiss & Jerry Kwan


616
01:20:04.530 --> 01:20:06.030
Uncle Herbert, he's an hour late

617
01:20:24.740 --> 01:20:28.660
Jerry...

618
01:20:29.680 --> 01:20:31.160
Somebody showed this in my hand

619
01:20:31.320 --> 01:20:32.190
Herbert's been kidnapped

620
01:20:32.790 --> 01:20:34.730
What! It must be a joke

621
01:20:34.920 --> 01:20:37.760
But this is his hat and it says
he won't be hurt if you lose


622
01:20:38.420 --> 01:20:39.490
But I must win

623
01:20:40.330 --> 01:20:41.060
I know

624
01:20:41.860 --> 01:20:45.770
We'll look, try to stall okay
and I'll see if I can find him


625
01:21:05.040 --> 01:21:05.990
Everything's fine

626
01:23:15.620 --> 01:23:16.980
Go easy, there's cops outside

627
01:24:26.370 --> 01:24:30.500
How about a little kiss, Kwan
a little kiss won't hurt you now


628
01:24:38.680 --> 01:24:40.620
You got no right up here
I'm in charge


629
01:24:41.020 --> 01:24:42.890
You're gonna have to get down

630
01:24:43.220 --> 01:24:45.320
Identify yourself

631
01:24:46.220 --> 01:24:47.850
Just a minute...

632
01:24:48.050 --> 01:24:52.030
Hey, Jerry... I'm okay

633
01:25:12.040 --> 01:25:14.520
I'm okay

634
01:25:49.240 --> 01:25:50.800
Get him into the movie house

635
01:25:55.040 --> 01:26:00.490
I've found David and good riddance

636
01:27:08.070 --> 01:27:10.270
Go and claim your prize Kiss

637
01:27:15.530 --> 01:27:17.010
They'll find Kwan here

638
01:27:19.480 --> 01:27:21.080
You're the one who beat up Jug

639
01:27:21.370 --> 01:27:24.690
Your friend? Maybe

640
01:30:12.620 --> 01:30:16.790
Be quiet... Be quiet now

641
01:30:17.180 --> 01:30:20.090
Come up and verify your opponent
can't continue


642
01:30:26.890 --> 01:30:28.130
Quiet please

643
01:30:34.730 --> 01:30:35.970
There he is

644
01:30:36.870 --> 01:30:39.570
There he is
