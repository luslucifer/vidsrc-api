Well, because it's pretty much
just us now.


305
00:23:05.148 --> 00:23:08.610
Our parents died in a car accident
a few years ago.


306

on Chris than it was on me.

got kicked off the circuit?

So we started running out of money
and that's how we ended up here.

death can be a positive thing.


317
00:23:41.851 --> 00:23:43.103
You know, because...

318
00:23:43.270 --> 00:23:47.440

makes you appreciate life.

Your sister's become

481
00:37:02.234 --> 00:37:05.571
Well, this--
This chick came into my house and--


482
00:37:05.738 --> 00:37:10.576
And she sprouted fangs and then she
turned into stone and exploded.


483
00:37:12.036 --> 00:37:14.372
Now, that's just ridiculous.

484
00:37:14.538 --> 00:37:17.291
Vampires don't just turn into stone
and then explode.


485
00:37:17.458 --> 00:37:20.920
They have to be pierced through the heart
with a sharp object.

You know, I guess
the antlers could have done that.


487

That's a myth. Any sharp object will do.

As a matter of fact,
it doesn't have to be sharp.


490
00:37:33.099 --> 00:37:35.810
It can be a blunt object,
as long as it pierces the heart.

You said my sister was one of them?

-One of two ways:

00:37:43.275 --> 00:37:47.279
...or B, she drank the blood
of the head vampire.

How do you know so much
about vampires?

and you give me comic books?

This poor sap's drinking the blood
of the head vampire.

They like to trick people
by putting it into wine bottles.

Dude, what are you drinking, man?

and now she's a vampire.

Half. She's only half vampire.

509

She won't make the transition to full
bloodsucker until she makes her first kill.
