to today's challenge?

-CARSON: Mm-hmm.

00:12:50.180 --> 00:12:52.940
PROBST:
Tribal immunity is no more.


315
00:12:53.050 --> 00:12:55.840
But we're not yet in
the individual part of the game,


316
00:12:55.940 --> 00:12:57.800
-so we don't have
individual immunity either.
-[groans]


317
00:12:57.910 --> 00:12:59.120
Here's how it's gonna work.

318
00:12:59.220 --> 00:13:00.740
For today's challenge,
you're gonna be


319
00:13:00.840 --> 00:13:03.360
randomly divided
into two teams of six.


320
00:13:04.980 --> 00:13:07.530
On my go, you're gonna
dig up a massive boulder,


321
00:13:07.630 --> 00:13:09.290
push it through
a series of obstacles,


322
00:13:09.390 --> 00:13:10.700
collecting a key along the way.

323
00:13:10.800 --> 00:13:13.080
You'll then work
together to get everybody


324
00:13:13.180 --> 00:13:14.530
to the top of a tall tower,

325
00:13:14.630 --> 00:13:16.630
where you will use that key

326
00:13:16.740 --> 00:13:19.360
to unlock the pieces
to a large tree puzzle.

♪ ♪

328
00:13:23.630 --> 00:13:26.430
The first team to finish
wins immunity.


329
00:13:26.530 --> 00:13:30.050
You'll get your Buff and
you will also get a merge meal,


330
00:13:30.150 --> 00:13:33.320
-your first proper food
in 13 days.
-Oh, man.

You'll be safe
tonight at Tribal Council.

00:13:45.980 --> 00:13:47.530
One of the six losers

336
00:13:47.630 --> 00:13:50.770
will be the seventh person
voted out of Survivor 44.

Danny, this
really is a turning point.


344

The people you end up
with right here will have a hand


345
00:14:07.940 --> 00:14:09.840
in whether or not
you have immunity and live


346

to see another day or whether
you go to Tribal Council.


347

This game is certainly
a lot of skill, but, uh,


348
00:14:14.740 --> 00:14:17.980
I don't think anybody would say
it doesn't have some luck to it.

-LAUREN: Come on, Yam Yam.


464
00:18:25.250 --> 00:18:27.050
-It is now orange in the lead.
-Your leg. Your leg.


465
00:18:27.150 --> 00:18:29.080
-PROBST: You got to get
everybody up and over.
-KANE: Come on, buddy.


466
00:18:29.180 --> 00:18:30.800
-Here comes Kane.
-KANE: Yes.


467
00:18:30.910 --> 00:18:33.290
With an assistant
from Danny and Josh.


468
00:18:33.390 --> 00:18:34.840
It is now purple.

469
00:18:34.940 --> 00:18:37.770
Trying to get Jaime up.
She has struggled.


470
00:18:37.870 --> 00:18:39.320
Carolyn giving her a hand.

471
00:18:39.430 --> 00:18:42.670
Once everybody's over,
you can move on to the puzzle.


472
00:18:42.770 --> 00:18:44.120
You're good, orange. Go!

473
00:18:44.220 --> 00:18:46.180
-Go, go, go, guys.
-PROBST: Orange now in the lead.


474
00:18:46.290 --> 00:18:48.770
-FRANNIE: I got you. I got you.
You're so strong, Jaime.
-PROBST: Jaime holding on.


475
00:18:48.870 --> 00:18:50.770
-Stay holding on, Jaime.
-Keep holding, keep holding.


476
00:18:50.870 --> 00:18:52.080
KANE:
Let's go, girls.


477
00:18:52.180 --> 00:18:53.320
-You guys got this.
-Look at the pieces.


478
00:18:53.430 --> 00:18:54.940
-Help, help, help.
-There you go.


479
00:18:55.050 --> 00:18:57.180
-You got it. You got it.
-You got it. Come on.


480
00:18:57.290 --> 00:18:58.740
Jaime, after a lot of effort,
is up.


481
00:18:58.840 --> 00:19:00.740
Here comes Carson.

482
00:19:00.840 --> 00:19:02.390
CAROLYN:
Yes! Carson's up.


483
00:19:02.490 --> 00:19:04.080
-Yes!
-PROBST: Brandon's waiting.
Brandon helped


484
00:19:04.180 --> 00:19:06.250
with everybody else.
Now Brandon's got to get up.


485
00:19:06.360 --> 00:19:07.940
Yeah.

486
00:19:08.050 --> 00:19:10.050
-He makes it look easy.
-Yeah!
-Yeah, Brandon! Yes!


487
00:19:10.150 --> 00:19:12.800
-Yes! Yeah!
-You're good, purple. Go!


488
00:19:12.910 --> 00:19:17.010
PROBST:
It's gonna be
Lauren and Heidi for orange,


489
00:19:17.120 --> 00:19:19.390
Matt and Carson for purple.

490
00:19:19.490 --> 00:19:20.530
Yes, that's it.

491
00:19:20.630 --> 00:19:21.940
FRANNIE:
There you go, Carson.


492
00:19:22.050 --> 00:19:23.630
PROBST:
Pressure position


493
00:19:23.740 --> 00:19:25.740
-for Matt, Carson,
Lauren and Heidi.
-JOSH: Come on, guys.


494
00:19:25.840 --> 00:19:27.840
-You got this.
-FRANNIE: Yes, Carson! Yes!


495
00:19:27.940 --> 00:19:29.670
Carson off
to a fast start for purple.


496
00:19:29.770 --> 00:19:32.180
-JOSH:
Keep going. You're doing great.
-You got it, ladies.


497
00:19:32.290 --> 00:19:34.150
PROBST:
You want to get to day 14,
it's happening right now.


498
00:19:34.250 --> 00:19:36.250
You want that Buff,
you want that food,


499
00:19:36.360 --> 00:19:37.630
-you want that security...
-BRANDON: Let's go, Carson.


500
00:19:37.740 --> 00:19:39.980
-...tonight at Tribal Council.
-We got this.


501
00:19:40.080 --> 00:19:42.150
PROBST:
Without it, somebody's dream
is coming to an end


502
00:19:42.250 --> 00:19:43.910
-in just a few hours.
-Let's go, Carson.


503
00:19:44.010 --> 00:19:46.150
-Yes!
-PROBST: Carson
with another piece.


504
00:19:46.250 --> 00:19:48.630
Carson is whipping
through this challenge.


505
00:19:48.740 --> 00:19:49.870
Think. Come on.

506
00:19:49.980 --> 00:19:51.940
PROBST:
Orange struggling,


507
00:19:52.050 --> 00:19:54.430
purple thriving.
You want to make the individual


508
00:19:54.530 --> 00:19:57.490
part of the game. As of right
now, you don't have a Buff.


509
00:19:57.600 --> 00:19:59.490
You're in limbo land right now.

510
00:19:59.600 --> 00:20:01.320
-Another piece by Carson.
-Yes!


511
00:20:01.430 --> 00:20:02.800
PROBST:
Wow.


512
00:20:02.910 --> 00:20:05.630
This looks like one that
orange cannot come back from.


513
00:20:05.740 --> 00:20:11.220
It is a runaway victory
for purple in the making.


514
00:20:11.320 --> 00:20:12.870
Carson with another piece.

515
00:20:12.980 --> 00:20:15.250
Down to two pieces left
for purple.


516
00:20:15.360 --> 00:20:16.980
An absolute blowout
with another piece.


517
00:20:17.080 --> 00:20:18.120
[indistinct chatter]

518
00:20:18.220 --> 00:20:19.530
BRANDON:
Let's go, Carson.


519
00:20:19.630 --> 00:20:20.840
PROBST: Carson
with the last piece for purple.


520
00:20:20.940 --> 00:20:22.630
-Yes. Yes. Yes!
-There it is.


521
00:20:22.740 --> 00:20:26.120
Purple wins immunity,

522
00:20:26.220 --> 00:20:29.290
safe tonight at Tribal Council.
All will make the next stage


523
00:20:29.390 --> 00:20:32.050
in this game.

524
00:20:32.150 --> 00:20:33.770
What a challenge.

525
00:20:33.870 --> 00:20:36.220
You were neck-and-neck
until the end.


526
00:20:36.320 --> 00:20:38.250
And it was over.

527
00:20:40.080 --> 00:20:41.870
Good job.

528
00:20:43.840 --> 00:20:46.320
Purple, a lot
of emotion down here.


529
00:20:46.430 --> 00:20:49.180
What's going on, Jaime?
There's a lot of tears.


530
00:20:49.290 --> 00:20:51.010
I just didn't want
to let my team down,


531
00:20:51.120 --> 00:20:52.460
especially with the wall.

532
00:20:52.560 --> 00:20:55.390
I'm so grateful
that they were there to catch me


533
00:20:55.490 --> 00:20:59.430
when I fell and to help me up
all the way. [crying]


534
00:20:59.530 --> 00:21:01.940
Carson, I'll give these to you.
You won that.


535
00:21:02.050 --> 00:21:04.490
-Yeah. Yeah...
-Take those Buffs, put them on.


536
00:21:04.600 --> 00:21:08.430
You have earned your way into
the next stage of this game.


537
00:21:08.530 --> 00:21:12.120
Nice job, everybody safe,
food coming for you.


538
00:21:12.220 --> 00:21:13.770
For the other six,

539
00:21:13.870 --> 00:21:15.670
one of you will be
the seventh person voted out.


540
00:21:15.770 --> 00:21:18.600
Grab your stuff, head out. See
you tonight at Tribal Council.


541
00:21:19.870 --> 00:21:22.670
CARSON:
I am just, like, beyond ecstatic


542
00:21:22.770 --> 00:21:24.670
because
all my hard work paid off.


543
00:21:24.770 --> 00:21:27.250
I have a 3D print
of this puzzle in my house,


544
00:21:27.360 --> 00:21:29.870
and put it together
probably a thousand times.


545
00:21:29.980 --> 00:21:32.940
I think it's a lesson that
you should always be prepared.


546
00:21:33.050 --> 00:21:35.180
And now I've made the merge.

547
00:21:35.290 --> 00:21:37.150
It's definitely one
of the best days of my life.


548
00:21:44.940 --> 00:21:47.120
If you want this, you got
to apply to be on Survivor.


549
00:21:56.050 --> 00:21:57.980
I wonder what they're eating.

550
00:21:58.080 --> 00:22:01.560
YAM YAM: So I come back
to the camp with the six losers,


551
00:22:01.670 --> 00:22:03.800
me being one of them.

552
00:22:03.910 --> 00:22:06.180
First thing I think is like,
"Oh, my God, I'm in trouble."


553
00:22:09.740 --> 00:22:12.320
And being one
of only six targets,


554
00:22:12.430 --> 00:22:15.120
I have no meal,
no Buff, no hope.


555
00:22:15.220 --> 00:22:17.080
What am I gonna do?

556
00:22:17.180 --> 00:22:18.530
What's your plan then, Yam?

557
00:22:18.630 --> 00:22:20.360
I have no idea 'cause
it's one of them, I think.


558
00:22:20.460 --> 00:22:23.220
-So, who are you thinking?
-Josh. It is what it is.


559
00:22:23.320 --> 00:22:25.700
It's always been me against him.

560
00:22:25.800 --> 00:22:28.600
Josh hasn't been talking to me
since we got to this beach.


561
00:22:28.700 --> 00:22:30.940
Who else am I gonna say?
It's obvious we don't get along.


562
00:22:31.050 --> 00:22:34.460
I'm gonna do whatever they...
whatever they come back and say.


563
00:22:34.560 --> 00:22:36.800
-Yeah.
-I mean, if they come back
and say, "Josh,"


564
00:22:36.910 --> 00:22:38.250
I'm in, so...
I mean, I would...


565
00:22:38.360 --> 00:22:39.840
If I was you,
I would be less worried


566
00:22:39.940 --> 00:22:41.600
about talking to me and Kane.

567
00:22:41.700 --> 00:22:44.630
YAM YAM:
Danny did not react
too well to the idea.


568
00:22:44.740 --> 00:22:46.180
He wanted to wait
for the six winners.


569
00:22:46.290 --> 00:22:48.180
I just opened my mouth
when I shouldn't have.


570
00:22:48.290 --> 00:22:51.220
I should have waited.
And here I go with


571
00:22:51.320 --> 00:22:54.360
my biggest Survivormistake
to date-- saying a name.


572
00:22:54.460 --> 00:22:56.250
I made a mistake.

573
00:22:56.360 --> 00:22:58.430
I swallow my words.

574
00:22:59.430 --> 00:23:00.530
Do you guys have a name?

575
00:23:00.630 --> 00:23:02.490
-I don't have a name.
-Me neither.


576
00:23:06.320 --> 00:23:09.050
-Yam Yam.
-I just have
a personal thing, you know?


577
00:23:09.150 --> 00:23:10.220
'Cause he was
against your number?


578
00:23:10.320 --> 00:23:11.670
Yeah.

579
00:23:11.770 --> 00:23:15.460
I'm down. He's not a number
for me, so, yeah.


580
00:23:15.560 --> 00:23:16.770
He's not a number for anybody.

581
00:23:16.870 --> 00:23:17.870
-All right.
-Yeah.


582
00:23:17.980 --> 00:23:19.120
JOSH: Right now,

583
00:23:19.220 --> 00:23:20.530
I don't have an idol

584
00:23:20.630 --> 00:23:22.220
so I want to get the target
on Yam Yam


585
00:23:22.320 --> 00:23:24.360
because Yam Yam and I don't have
a great history,


586
00:23:24.460 --> 00:23:26.120
I don't trust him.

587
00:23:26.220 --> 00:23:27.910
You know, he voted for me, so,

588
00:23:28.010 --> 00:23:29.150
I want to get him out
immediately.


589
00:23:31.320 --> 00:23:34.080
I just have a personal vendetta
against him, so, that's why


590
00:23:34.180 --> 00:23:36.120
I'm just like,
"Ugh! I can't trust him again."


591
00:23:36.220 --> 00:23:38.010
-Hey, I'm down.
-Me too.


592
00:23:38.120 --> 00:23:39.430
We have to survive today.

593
00:23:39.530 --> 00:23:40.980
-You and I have
to survive today.
-I know.


594
00:23:43.320 --> 00:23:44.870
I've heard that he does.

595
00:23:44.980 --> 00:23:46.530
-Me too.
-Yeah.


596
00:23:46.630 --> 00:23:48.600
-Wh-Which makes me wonder.
-Yeah.


597
00:23:48.700 --> 00:23:51.670
HEIDI: Right now,
the vote may be Yam Yam, but


598
00:23:51.770 --> 00:23:53.150
in all honesty, for my game,

599
00:23:53.250 --> 00:23:55.530
I think Josh going home is...
is the right thing.


600
00:23:55.630 --> 00:23:57.870
He survived Soka,
he survived Tika,


601
00:23:57.980 --> 00:24:01.490
even though he was going to be
the next voted out.


602
00:24:01.600 --> 00:24:04.220
But if he has an idol,
there may be a plan B, which


603
00:24:04.320 --> 00:24:07.430
could be Yam Yam, or maybe
it could change by tonight.


604
00:24:13.630 --> 00:24:16.120
[all whooping]

605
00:24:16.220 --> 00:24:17.600
-My God.
-[screaming]
-Here we go.


606
00:24:17.700 --> 00:24:20.490
We made it to the merge feast!

607
00:24:22.150 --> 00:24:23.800
-ALL: cheers!
-[whooping]
-Congratulations.


608
00:24:23.910 --> 00:24:27.600
The stakes were really high
for the challenge.


609
00:24:27.700 --> 00:24:29.250
We were playing for immunity,

610
00:24:29.360 --> 00:24:32.150
and we were getting
the merge feast.


611
00:24:32.250 --> 00:24:33.600
-Oh, my God.
-Okay, let's freaking eat.


612
00:24:33.700 --> 00:24:35.320
-Let's go!
-Yeah.


613
00:24:35.430 --> 00:24:36.840
JAIME:
And we did it.


614
00:24:36.940 --> 00:24:39.080
We hadn't eaten in 13 days.

615
00:24:39.180 --> 00:24:41.980
If you count worms
and some papaya,


616
00:24:42.080 --> 00:24:44.360
then great, but this was

617
00:24:44.460 --> 00:24:45.980
a true full-blown meal.

618
00:24:46.080 --> 00:24:47.740
-Wine?
-CAROLYN: Wine!


619
00:24:47.840 --> 00:24:49.360
[laughing]:
Let's go, let's go.


620
00:24:49.460 --> 00:24:51.630
JAIME:
The wand has been busy.


621
00:24:51.740 --> 00:24:53.740
Win the challenge.

622
00:24:53.840 --> 00:24:55.220
Bling! Get your Buff back.

623
00:24:55.320 --> 00:24:57.490
Bling! Win immunity?

624
00:24:57.600 --> 00:25:00.180
Ring, ring, ring! [laughs]
It's all happening.


625
00:25:00.290 --> 00:25:02.430
So who do you guys view...

626
00:25:03.430 --> 00:25:06.120
...as the biggest threat out
of those six that are up there?


627
00:25:06.220 --> 00:25:08.430
MATT:
I think Josh is
a pretty big threat


628
00:25:08.530 --> 00:25:10.010
-for sure, yeah.
-FRANNIE: He is a very


629
00:25:10.120 --> 00:25:12.250
-adept social player.
-MATT: Yeah.


630
00:25:12.360 --> 00:25:15.050
If he has an idol,
he's playing it tonight.


631
00:25:15.150 --> 00:25:16.740
So there has to be a vote
on someone else.


632
00:25:16.840 --> 00:25:18.600
BRANDON:
A lot of people want
to vote for Josh.


633
00:25:18.700 --> 00:25:20.320
The only issue is

634
00:25:20.430 --> 00:25:21.800
he told me that he has an idol.

635
00:25:21.910 --> 00:25:23.320
I mean, he's told other people

636
00:25:23.430 --> 00:25:25.120
that he doesn't have an idol,
so in the case


637
00:25:25.220 --> 00:25:27.800
that he does have an idol,
we need to have a plan B.


638
00:25:27.910 --> 00:25:29.430
-So who would be plan B then?
-[rolling thunder]


639
00:25:29.530 --> 00:25:31.460
Does anyone feel close to Kane?

640
00:25:31.560 --> 00:25:33.220
I wasclose with him,
but I just...


641
00:25:33.320 --> 00:25:35.150
You know how you can just tell
when somebody looks at you?


642
00:25:35.250 --> 00:25:36.530
'Cause the way
he looks at me sometimes,


643
00:25:36.630 --> 00:25:38.220
I'm like, "I just know that..."

644
00:25:38.320 --> 00:25:39.600
-Something else
is going on there.
-I'm so serious, though.


645
00:25:39.700 --> 00:25:41.430
Kane voted for me
at the first Tribal,


646
00:25:41.530 --> 00:25:42.530
and he's tried to,
you know, apologize


647
00:25:42.630 --> 00:25:44.050
to me and stuff like that.

648
00:25:44.150 --> 00:25:46.390
But I forgive,
but I don't forget, and I know


649
00:25:46.490 --> 00:25:47.770
that he's somebody who is gonna
come for me again.


650
00:25:47.870 --> 00:25:49.150
It's just a matter of when.

651
00:25:49.250 --> 00:25:51.670
We also need to be careful
about who we tell.


652
00:25:51.770 --> 00:25:53.050
'Cause we don't want Josh
to play his idol,


653
00:25:53.150 --> 00:25:54.670
-you know?
-MATT: Right.


654
00:25:54.770 --> 00:25:56.600
-He doesn't have one.
He does not have one.
-Yeah.


655
00:25:56.700 --> 00:25:58.740
CAROLYN:
He showed me the one
he got from the journey.


656
00:25:58.840 --> 00:26:00.390
He used that already.

657
00:26:00.490 --> 00:26:01.980
Then he tried to say

658
00:26:02.080 --> 00:26:05.080
that he had another idol,
so he whipped it out.


659
00:26:05.180 --> 00:26:06.460
And then Yam Yam goes,

660
00:26:06.560 --> 00:26:08.220
"You took that
from tree mail this morning."


661
00:26:08.320 --> 00:26:10.050
-Yeah.
-CAROLYN: Now, knowing
that information, does anybody


662
00:26:10.150 --> 00:26:11.600
here think
he actually has an idol?


663
00:26:13.220 --> 00:26:14.560
No.

664
00:26:14.670 --> 00:26:16.080
FRANNIE:
So I think we have to plan


665
00:26:16.180 --> 00:26:18.150
-just in case as if he does.
-Yeah. Right.


666
00:26:18.250 --> 00:26:21.840
CAROLYN:
The people at the merge feast


667
00:26:21.940 --> 00:26:23.840
are all worried about an idol,
and I know


668
00:26:23.940 --> 00:26:26.670
Josh does not have an idol.

669
00:26:26.770 --> 00:26:29.390
I tell them the story
of the fake idol.


670
00:26:29.490 --> 00:26:31.220
I tell them how he stole it
from tree mail,


671
00:26:31.320 --> 00:26:34.770
and they still
wouldn't believe me.


672
00:26:34.870 --> 00:26:37.940
Maybe Josh leaves fake,
takes real,


673
00:26:38.050 --> 00:26:39.320
but leaves the paper

674
00:26:39.430 --> 00:26:41.840
that says "This is a real
hidden immunity idol."


675
00:26:43.770 --> 00:26:45.220
What the ...?!

676
00:26:46.320 --> 00:26:48.390
They still are questioning it.

677
00:26:48.490 --> 00:26:50.180
I'm done.

JAIME:
At the merge meal, we...


689
00:27:33.390 --> 00:27:36.220
all came up with the vote
tonight being Josh.


690
00:27:36.320 --> 00:27:37.630
So,

691
00:27:37.740 --> 00:27:41.430
it sounds like
we have an easy Tribal Council.


692
00:27:41.530 --> 00:27:42.770
However,
that's not always the case,


693
00:27:42.870 --> 00:27:44.700
Knowing the game of Survivor.

694
00:27:44.800 --> 00:27:47.870
Tell us, did any names come up,
any of our names?


695
00:27:47.980 --> 00:27:50.290
-Is everyone... gone?
-Yes.


696
00:27:50.390 --> 00:27:54.560
JAIME:
So right now,
we are pretty unanimous on


697
00:27:54.670 --> 00:27:57.390
-Josh being the biggest threat.
-Okay.


698
00:27:57.490 --> 00:27:59.840
But the only thing is, I don't
know if any of you guys know


699
00:27:59.940 --> 00:28:02.010
if he has an idol.

700
00:28:02.120 --> 00:28:06.080
Because Josh might have an idol,
people threw Kane's name


701
00:28:06.180 --> 00:28:09.530
as a plan B so, we have a couple
of votes going on Kane.


702
00:28:09.630 --> 00:28:11.670
But hopefully,
our number-one plan works.


703
00:28:13.980 --> 00:28:16.010
...while we were eating.

704
00:28:23.490 --> 00:28:24.740
Okay.

705
00:28:24.840 --> 00:28:26.320
JOSH:
My first thought was, "Okay,


706
00:28:26.430 --> 00:28:27.870
Yam Yam's the vote,"
but Frannie came to me


707
00:28:27.980 --> 00:28:29.530
and said, "It seems that Kane

708
00:28:29.630 --> 00:28:31.630
was the primary vote
that they were going for."


709
00:28:31.740 --> 00:28:33.600
And I said, "Fine, I'm fine
with that. That's great."


710
00:28:33.700 --> 00:28:35.560
So this puts in my mind,
then, I need


711
00:28:35.670 --> 00:28:37.870
to squash everything
with Yam Yam


712
00:28:37.980 --> 00:28:39.120
and make this work.

713
00:28:43.740 --> 00:28:45.980
Instead of everyone
separating you and me.


714
00:28:46.080 --> 00:28:48.250
Ah.

715
00:28:50.800 --> 00:28:53.630
JOSH:
It makes sense for us both
to put Kane's name down


716
00:28:53.740 --> 00:28:55.700
because we know each other,
we don't really know Kane.


717
00:28:55.800 --> 00:28:58.460
And I think I can save
my personal vendetta


718
00:28:58.560 --> 00:29:00.490
against Yam Yam for another day.

719
00:29:00.600 --> 00:29:03.910
I just want to look into
your face and... We're good.


720
00:29:04.010 --> 00:29:05.800
I thought
you were gonna kiss me.


721
00:29:05.910 --> 00:29:07.530
I was like,
"Not here. I'm married."


722
00:29:07.630 --> 00:29:09.490
Can we do
the double-crossing hand?


723
00:29:09.600 --> 00:29:11.390
Girl.

724
00:29:11.490 --> 00:29:13.940
YAM YAM: Josh, the person
I'm trying to take out, he said,


725
00:29:14.050 --> 00:29:16.840
Kane as a vote,
which is a great idea.


726
00:29:16.940 --> 00:29:18.770
You know, but I like Kane.

727
00:29:18.870 --> 00:29:22.050
I don't want
to write Kane's name down.


728
00:29:22.150 --> 00:29:23.770
I want to write
Josh's name down


729
00:29:23.870 --> 00:29:26.530
and look at him and say,
"Bye, baby." You know?


730
00:29:27.560 --> 00:29:29.840
I want that gratification.

731
00:29:29.940 --> 00:29:31.700
Are you gonna play your idol?

732
00:29:31.800 --> 00:29:34.150
I probably have to.
I mean, yes.


733
00:29:34.250 --> 00:29:35.770
Give it to me.

734
00:29:35.870 --> 00:29:37.180
Why would I give... Girl...

735
00:29:37.290 --> 00:29:39.490
-'Cause we're making friends.
-Girl, no.


736
00:29:39.600 --> 00:29:41.050
YAM YAM:
But it's better Kane than me.


737
00:29:41.150 --> 00:29:44.600
So, do I have any hope
of working with Josh?


738
00:29:44.700 --> 00:29:46.290
I'm not gonna rule it out,

739
00:29:46.390 --> 00:29:48.840
but it's gonna
be my last option.


740
00:29:52.390 --> 00:29:54.120
Yeah.

741
00:29:54.220 --> 00:29:55.360
BRANDON: Part of me hopes
that Josh does go home,


742
00:29:55.460 --> 00:29:56.980
but then, part of me hopes

743
00:29:57.080 --> 00:29:59.430
that he doesn't, and then,
Kane goes home 'cause I really


744
00:29:59.530 --> 00:30:00.700
don't trust Kane.

745
00:30:03.080 --> 00:30:05.320
-He's played...
-He freaks out anyway.


746
00:30:05.430 --> 00:30:06.870
BRANDON:
But what could go wrong


747
00:30:06.980 --> 00:30:09.390
with this plan is
that Kane somehow finds out


748
00:30:09.490 --> 00:30:11.320
that he's a name.

749
00:30:11.430 --> 00:30:12.940
That's the scary part.
You know, we all


750
00:30:13.050 --> 00:30:16.530
seem so on the same page,
but it only takes one person


751
00:30:16.630 --> 00:30:19.870
to go tell the wrong person
some information,


752
00:30:19.980 --> 00:30:21.670
and everything could change.

753
00:30:21.770 --> 00:30:23.180
How are you feeling?

754
00:30:23.290 --> 00:30:26.600
Well, like, a little bit
nervous because my...


755
00:30:26.700 --> 00:30:29.390
Like, my ass is
technically on the line.


756
00:30:29.490 --> 00:30:31.430
But, like, did you hear anything
at the picnic or anything?


757
00:30:31.530 --> 00:30:32.910
Soka was pitching you.

758
00:30:33.010 --> 00:30:36.080
But everyone ended up
going to Josh.


759
00:30:36.180 --> 00:30:38.360
I'm just worried Josh is, like,
gonna play an idol.


760
00:30:38.460 --> 00:30:39.870
Then I don't know
what will happen.


761
00:30:39.980 --> 00:30:42.940
I disclosed Kane's name
being brought up because


762
00:30:43.050 --> 00:30:45.670
I legitimately feel like
I connect with Kane.


763
00:30:45.770 --> 00:30:47.700
On Ratu, Kane and I bonded

764
00:30:47.800 --> 00:30:49.740
because he's a nerd
and I'm a nerd, and


765
00:30:49.840 --> 00:30:51.290
I kind of did want
to work with him.


766
00:30:54.700 --> 00:30:56.460
Okay.

767
00:30:56.560 --> 00:30:58.910
My name is swirling.
That's a concerning thing.


768
00:30:59.010 --> 00:31:00.560
I don't want my name out there

769
00:31:00.670 --> 00:31:02.560
just so Josh doesn't play
his idol.


770
00:31:02.670 --> 00:31:05.320
Yam Yam seems like a perfectly
fine name to get out there.


771
00:31:05.430 --> 00:31:07.460
I don't understand why
we had to mix my name into it.


772
00:31:09.910 --> 00:31:11.800
I'm going for Yam.

773
00:31:11.910 --> 00:31:15.180
So I'm trying to get people
to vote Yam Yam instead of Josh


774
00:31:15.290 --> 00:31:19.080
because if Josh plays an idol,
whoever he votes for goes,


775
00:31:19.180 --> 00:31:21.120
and I certainly don't want it
to be me.


776
00:31:21.220 --> 00:31:22.530
But Josh wanted Yam Yam.

777
00:31:22.630 --> 00:31:24.180
Yeah.

778
00:31:24.290 --> 00:31:26.120
KANE:
Yam Yam is
a more chaotic player,


779
00:31:26.220 --> 00:31:28.800
so let's just get rid
of Yam Yam so that


780
00:31:28.910 --> 00:31:31.360
I'm still safe because I don't
know who all is gunning for me.


781
00:31:31.460 --> 00:31:32.600
I don't know these people.

782
00:31:32.700 --> 00:31:35.120
So thank God I talked to Carson.

783
00:31:35.220 --> 00:31:36.490
Yeah, that was a bad move,
Carson.


784
00:31:36.600 --> 00:31:39.430
-Why...?
-I did... He-he...


785
00:31:39.530 --> 00:31:41.560
-I know he is su... I think...
-First,


786
00:31:41.670 --> 00:31:43.740
he asked me. He's like,
"Did my name come to mind?"


787
00:31:43.840 --> 00:31:47.050
-I'm so sorry.
-This is gonna shake things up a
lot.


788
00:31:47.150 --> 00:31:50.290
So, I think Josh has
a real idol, which is scary.


789
00:31:50.390 --> 00:31:51.770
KANE:
Will you vote for Yam tonight?


790
00:31:51.870 --> 00:31:53.430
Yeah, Yam Yam goes home.

791
00:31:53.530 --> 00:31:55.700
-Yeah, I can do that.
I'll do that for sure.
-Yeah.


792
00:31:55.800 --> 00:31:58.180
MATT: Kane wants
to switch the vote to Yam Yam,


793
00:31:58.290 --> 00:32:01.600
and as of this moment,
I am interested


794
00:32:01.700 --> 00:32:06.250
in having a very large majority
because I do not have a vote,


795
00:32:06.360 --> 00:32:10.080
and I think that Yam Yam
is a pretty easy vote


796
00:32:10.180 --> 00:32:13.050
for most of the people
still in this game.


797
00:32:14.530 --> 00:32:16.080
Yeah.

798
00:32:16.180 --> 00:32:17.980
Mm-hmm.

799
00:32:18.080 --> 00:32:19.840
Yeah, I think so, too.

800
00:32:19.940 --> 00:32:22.080
MATT:
Yam Yam doesn't have
super strong relationships


801
00:32:22.180 --> 00:32:24.630
with almost anyone
in this game right now.


802
00:32:30.390 --> 00:32:33.050
MATT:
But even back in Soka, we were
trying to get rid of Josh,


803
00:32:33.150 --> 00:32:34.630
because nobody trusted him.

804
00:32:34.740 --> 00:32:37.010
And if he escapes
at tonight's Tribal Council,


805
00:32:37.120 --> 00:32:40.740
he is like Superman, you know,
bullets bouncing off his chest.


806
00:32:40.840 --> 00:32:42.800
If Josh has an idol,
he's playing it tonight.


807
00:32:43.840 --> 00:32:46.980
It's all a gamble.
You know, you have to make


808
00:32:47.080 --> 00:32:48.490
these calculated risks.

809
00:32:48.600 --> 00:32:51.120
-I don't know
what is going on here.
-Mm-hmm.


810
00:32:51.220 --> 00:32:53.940
Yeah, like, my eyes are gonna
jump out of my ... face.


811
00:32:54.050 --> 00:32:56.180
[Lauren laughs]

812
00:32:56.290 --> 00:32:59.150
MATT:
There are so many variables
in this game.


813
00:32:59.250 --> 00:33:01.150
Everyone on the same beach

814
00:33:01.250 --> 00:33:02.910
is honestly overwhelming.

815
00:33:03.010 --> 00:33:04.180
Yam Yam's nervous,
Kane's nervous.


816
00:33:04.290 --> 00:33:06.430
I don't know
what's about to happen.


817
00:33:06.530 --> 00:33:07.800
I'm getting confused.
I-I have no...


818
00:33:07.910 --> 00:33:09.490
Legit, things have changed.

819
00:33:09.600 --> 00:33:11.430
I... No idea.

820
00:33:11.530 --> 00:33:13.670
MATT:
There's so many people,
there's so many personalities,


821
00:33:13.770 --> 00:33:16.670
there's so many different bonds.

822
00:33:16.770 --> 00:33:20.980
The matrix of relationships is

823
00:33:21.080 --> 00:33:23.670
exponentially more complex
in a group of 12.


824
00:33:23.770 --> 00:33:25.490
So, my mind is spinning.

825
00:33:25.600 --> 00:33:29.120
So far, we have been playing
Survivor.


826
00:33:29.220 --> 00:33:31.670
Now we're playingSurvivor
with a capital S.


827
00:33:38.560 --> 00:33:40.910
♪ ♪

828
00:33:51.010 --> 00:33:53.010
♪ ♪

829
00:33:55.290 --> 00:33:57.670
All right.

830
00:33:57.770 --> 00:33:59.220
Carson, before we get into

831
00:33:59.320 --> 00:34:01.050
the nitty-gritty
of tonight's Tribal,


832
00:34:01.150 --> 00:34:02.980
what's the biggest difference

833
00:34:03.080 --> 00:34:05.630
having so many people living
together? Even looking tonight,


834
00:34:05.740 --> 00:34:09.320
we haven't had a Tribal
with everybody here until now.


835
00:34:09.430 --> 00:34:11.770
Yeah. I feel like
on your individual tribes,


836
00:34:11.870 --> 00:34:14.080
you're able to kind of
keep track of what's going on.


837
00:34:14.180 --> 00:34:17.800
But when we're all on one beach,
it's chaotic.


838
00:34:17.910 --> 00:34:20.120
You can't keep track
of what anyone's saying.


839
00:34:20.220 --> 00:34:23.770
So you almost have to rely
on the people you trust more


840
00:34:23.870 --> 00:34:26.600
because you don't know
what conversations they've had


841
00:34:26.700 --> 00:34:28.390
and what they could be
saying about you.


842
00:34:28.490 --> 00:34:30.390
PROBST:
Kane, how did
you approach today?


843
00:34:30.490 --> 00:34:32.630
Because there's so many
different things happening.


844
00:34:32.740 --> 00:34:34.180
You have
everybody living together,


845
00:34:34.290 --> 00:34:36.010
but you also have only half

846
00:34:36.120 --> 00:34:38.360
of the people
that are in trouble tonight


847
00:34:38.460 --> 00:34:39.910
-and could be voted out.
-KANE: Carson put it right.


848
00:34:40.010 --> 00:34:43.180
We need to operate from a place
of belief and trust.


849
00:34:43.290 --> 00:34:45.120
So I met some of these folks
one day ago,


850
00:34:45.220 --> 00:34:47.180
so I don't really know
what they're all about.


851
00:34:47.290 --> 00:34:49.290
And I met some
of these people 13 days ago,


852
00:34:49.390 --> 00:34:50.870
and I still don't really know
what they're all about.


853
00:34:50.980 --> 00:34:55.050
So, uh, I think that it's
really about the information


854
00:34:55.150 --> 00:34:56.630
that comes back to me,
whether it's true,


855
00:34:56.740 --> 00:34:58.010
whether it's false, if it's
from the people that I trust,


856
00:34:58.120 --> 00:35:00.460
that is my truth tonight.

857
00:35:00.560 --> 00:35:04.050
PROBST:
Yam Yam, how do you feel
given that Tika got so small--


858
00:35:04.150 --> 00:35:06.800
you, Josh, and Carolyn--
so you don't have a lot


859
00:35:06.910 --> 00:35:08.770
of numbers coming into this?

860
00:35:08.870 --> 00:35:10.910
YAM YAM:
We're coming into this tribe
at a disadvantage,


861
00:35:11.010 --> 00:35:14.150
and me and my big mouth
might be an even easier target.


862
00:35:14.250 --> 00:35:16.080
-So...
-PROBST: Is that real?


863
00:35:16.180 --> 00:35:18.870
Do you feel like you talk
too much or say the wrong thing?


864
00:35:18.980 --> 00:35:22.490
It's a thing that happens
in my normal life, you know?


865
00:35:22.600 --> 00:35:24.220
I just can't hold it in.

866
00:35:24.320 --> 00:35:26.980
I can see the faces when I speak
more than I have to speak,


867
00:35:27.080 --> 00:35:30.150
but I just can't stop. You know,
I mean, it keeps coming out.


868
00:35:30.250 --> 00:35:32.150
Now I can't stop, either.

869
00:35:32.250 --> 00:35:33.740
You keep looking at me.
I think you want more.


870
00:35:33.840 --> 00:35:35.250
You want more? I don't know.

871
00:35:35.360 --> 00:35:37.740
[laughter]

872
00:35:37.840 --> 00:35:39.430
PROBST:
Josh, you're a part
of this Tika three.


873
00:35:39.530 --> 00:35:43.390
Yeah, so, I come
from a little bit of a unique


874
00:35:43.490 --> 00:35:46.800
kind of background because
I did have a tribe before Soka


875
00:35:46.910 --> 00:35:49.360
that I started
establishing relationships


876
00:35:49.460 --> 00:35:51.390
and conversations with
in the beginning.


877
00:35:51.490 --> 00:35:53.630
And then, when we came back
together, that allowed me


878
00:35:53.740 --> 00:35:57.150
the opportunity to reconnect,
so for me, it was a benefit.


879
00:35:57.250 --> 00:36:01.250
Brandon, how much talk was there
amongst the group


880
00:36:01.360 --> 00:36:03.050
about who might have idols?

881
00:36:03.150 --> 00:36:05.460
Speculation,
stories heard on journeys?


882
00:36:05.560 --> 00:36:07.800
Yes, there was absolutely a lot
of talk about idols.


883
00:36:07.910 --> 00:36:10.530
You know, who might have them,
who might not have them, are...


884
00:36:10.630 --> 00:36:12.050
Is it a fake idol?
Is it a real idol?


885
00:36:12.150 --> 00:36:14.050
Like, there was a lot
of talk about idols today.


886
00:36:14.150 --> 00:36:16.600
PROBST:
So, Carolyn,
what do you do when


887
00:36:16.700 --> 00:36:18.700
you're cross-checking
all of that in your head


888
00:36:18.800 --> 00:36:20.460
-to keep it straight?
-There has been so much


889
00:36:20.560 --> 00:36:22.220
information going around,
the fear of idols,


890
00:36:22.320 --> 00:36:25.530
all of this speculation
about fake idols,


891
00:36:25.630 --> 00:36:28.320
and the cage, and we just...

892
00:36:28.430 --> 00:36:30.050
Getting together,
especially at the feast,


893
00:36:30.150 --> 00:36:32.700
and hearing
so many different stories,


894
00:36:32.800 --> 00:36:34.150
it's so much information.

895
00:36:34.250 --> 00:36:36.120
I'm used to talking
to two other people.


896
00:36:36.220 --> 00:36:38.120
This is insanity.

897
00:36:38.220 --> 00:36:41.490
PROBST:
So, Heidi, is the concern
always that I'm being


898
00:36:41.600 --> 00:36:44.770
told to vote this way,
but what might be happening is


899
00:36:44.870 --> 00:36:46.940
I'm the only one
that's gonna vote that way,


900
00:36:47.050 --> 00:36:48.940
and I'm not in on the vote?

901
00:36:49.050 --> 00:36:50.740
HEIDI:
Yeah, it's very scary.


902
00:36:50.840 --> 00:36:53.530
It's like I'm driving the car.
I pick one person,


903
00:36:53.630 --> 00:36:55.910
they tell me a story A
and plan A.


904
00:36:56.010 --> 00:36:59.840
I drop them, I pick up
person B. They tell me story B


905
00:36:59.940 --> 00:37:02.220
and plan B. And then it's like,
"Okay, A or B?"


906
00:37:02.320 --> 00:37:05.150
I pick up C,
and they-they have plan C.


907
00:37:05.250 --> 00:37:06.700
So it was
all over the place today.


908
00:37:06.800 --> 00:37:09.910
Yam Yam, when you're watching
Survivorat home,


909
00:37:10.010 --> 00:37:11.770
-you have all the information.
-Yeah.


910
00:37:11.870 --> 00:37:13.390
But when
you're sitting here tonight,


911

all the information,


912
00:37:15.250 --> 00:37:17.630
it really is
a terrifying thought.


913
00:37:17.740 --> 00:37:22.530
Every player is worried
at Tribal because they don't


914
00:37:22.630 --> 00:37:25.460

-YAM YAM: There hasn't been

been worried, like, for real.


916
00:37:28.080 --> 00:37:29.800
I'm really scared right now,
and I think


917
00:37:29.910 --> 00:37:31.980
the six of us
are feeling the same thing.


918
00:37:32.080 --> 00:37:34.390
Like, none of us are sure.

919
00:37:35.390 --> 00:37:37.770
Can we go back to the beach
and not do this tonight?

we vote two people next Tribal?

Matt, it is a rare opportunity

925
00:37:51.360 --> 00:37:54.430
to try to utilize
a little leverage


926
00:37:54.530 --> 00:37:56.250
and get just a little bit
of a foothold


927

the same leverage.

But at the same time,
it's overwhelming.


930

I-I think we all feel that
the game has turned a corner.


931
00:38:06.770 --> 00:38:08.430
You know, like, in our tribes,

932
00:38:08.530 --> 00:38:10.250
we're kind of going down
the bunny slopes,


933
00:38:10.360 --> 00:38:11.910
and then, we've turned a corner,
and suddenly,


934
00:38:12.010 --> 00:38:15.050
it's double black diamond,
and we're flying down.

And then, a confetti cannon
goes... [whooshing]

that you have to put together

00:38:20.250 --> 00:38:22.290
with all the little pieces
as you're going down the hill.

And then, you have to vote
based on this picture.
