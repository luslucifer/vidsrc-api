1
00:03:01.633 --> 00:03:03.783
I don't know the names.

2
00:03:03.993 --> 00:03:06.507
- And are you going back?
- Maybe.


3
00:03:06.713 --> 00:03:10.104
What crimes did you commit
during the war?


4
00:03:10.313 --> 00:03:12.623
I thought we weren't going
to talk about that.


5
00:03:12.833 --> 00:03:17.066
You don't have anything to worry about.
You can't be prosecuted, so why not?


6
00:03:17.273 --> 00:03:20.186
What crimes did you commit
during the war?


7
00:03:20.393 --> 00:03:23.192
They weren't crimes
when I committed them.


8
00:03:23.393 --> 00:03:26.112
They became crimes
when we lost the war.


9
00:03:26.313 --> 00:03:30.022
- Larry would like to see you, Nick.
- Can it wait?


10
00:03:30.233 --> 00:03:32.668
Why? What's up?

11
00:03:33.833 --> 00:03:36.552
- You got the job.
- In Athens?


12
00:03:36.753 --> 00:03:39.142
But you didn't hear it from me, OK?

13
00:03:39.353 --> 00:03:40.912
Hear what?

14
00:03:41.113 --> 00:03:42.626
Congratulations.

15
00:04:10.153 --> 00:04:13.589
The magic number is eight.
Any combination of eight wins...


16
00:04:13.793 --> 00:04:17.070
- Dad?
- ...and the Sox win the Eastern Division.


17
00:04:17.273 --> 00:04:23.463
Now turning to basketball. Last night
the Celtics won over the Rockets.


18
00:04:23.673 --> 00:04:27.109
A strong performance by Larry Bird...

19
00:04:33.393 --> 00:04:35.509
Nikki.

20
00:04:35.713 --> 00:04:41.629
Dad, if you always fall asleep
during the news, you'll never keep up.


21
00:04:41.833 --> 00:04:45.542
I know, but if I
stay awake for the news,

22
00:04:45.753 --> 00:04:50.543
I get so upset at what I hear,
I can't sleep at night.


23
00:04:52.753 --> 00:04:54.505
I'll make some coffee.

24
00:04:54.713 --> 00:04:58.388
My grandson's birthdays coming up.

25
00:04:58.593 --> 00:05:01.711
Does he want a bicycle?

26
00:05:01.913 --> 00:05:03.392
I don't know.

27
00:05:03.593 --> 00:05:06.585
He's a big boy. 
Nine years old.

28
00:05:07.553 --> 00:05:11.148
The same age as I was
when I left Greece.


29
00:05:11.353 --> 00:05:16.951
And I'm now the same age
as Mother was when she was killed.


30
00:05:17.153 --> 00:05:21.545
- I got that job in Athens.
- But you promised Eleni.


31
00:05:21.753 --> 00:05:27.510
Didn't she make you promise
that you'd never go back?


32
00:05:29.113 --> 00:05:31.502
Nick?

33
00:05:31.713 --> 00:05:34.148
Yes, I promised.

34
00:05:36.673 --> 00:05:41.793
I want to know why they tortured her,
why they killed her.


35
00:05:41.993 --> 00:05:45.782
What it was like
to suffer the way she did.


36
00:05:45.993 --> 00:05:48.507
Why do you want to know that?

37
00:05:48.713 --> 00:05:51.432
Because I can't think of anything else.

38
00:05:53.113 --> 00:05:57.391
Sometimes people say things
before they're killed or about to die,


39
00:05:57.593 --> 00:06:01.826
and I want to know
what her last words were.


40
00:06:02.033 --> 00:06:03.592
Everything-

41
00:06:03.793 --> 00:06:07.832
- Why now, all of a sudden?
- Things are converging.


42
00:06:08.033 --> 00:06:10.547
You should forget these things.

43
00:06:10.753 --> 00:06:12.073
I tried.

44
00:06:12.273 --> 00:06:14.947
But there is one thing I can't forget,

45
00:06:15.153 --> 00:06:19.545
this wonderful legal invention
called the statute of limitations.


46
00:06:19.753 --> 00:06:23.792
After a certain amount of time,
you're absolved of all your crimes.


47
00:06:23.993 --> 00:06:26.303
You committed atrocities during the war.

48
00:06:26.513 --> 00:06:31.462
If you wait long enough, as if by magic,
you become innocent again.


49
00:06:31.673 --> 00:06:35.348
In Greece,
you wait 30 years for innocence.


50
00:06:35.553 --> 00:06:37.988
Thirty years are up.

51
00:06:38.193 --> 00:06:43.472
The murderers, hiding in other countries,
are free to go back now.


52
00:06:43.673 --> 00:06:48.747
The man responsible for my mother's
death could be innocent now.


53
00:06:48.953 --> 00:06:52.662
And I sit here drinking coffee.

54
00:06:52.873 --> 00:06:57.629
Nikki, you have waited
all this time for that?


55
00:07:05.353 --> 00:07:06.866
Thanks.

56
00:07:07.073 --> 00:07:10.065
No pencils. Nick, is that you?

57
00:07:10.953 --> 00:07:12.227
Nick?

58
00:07:13.233 --> 00:07:14.871
Nick?

59
00:07:20.033 --> 00:07:23.389
Hey!

60
00:07:27.993 --> 00:07:29.472
Thank you.

61
00:07:45.073 --> 00:07:48.907
Dear Mother of God,
we thank you for these blessings.


62
00:07:49.113 --> 00:07:50.387
Dear Mother...

63
00:07:52.313 --> 00:07:54.543
l... We...

64
00:08:00.833 --> 00:08:02.665
Nick?

65
00:08:09.913 --> 00:08:12.746
There you go. One, two, three...

66
00:08:12.953 --> 00:08:17.231
- on!
- Bad luck. It's $2,000.


67
00:08:30.153 --> 00:08:31.632
Nikola!

68
00:09:08.113 --> 00:09:10.946
Christ is risen!

69
00:09:11.153 --> 00:09:13.667
Indeed He is risen.

70
00:09:24.793 --> 00:09:28.991
- Christ is risen.
- Indeed He is risen.


71
00:09:36.433 --> 00:09:40.825
- Does Father know that the war is over?
- Of course he knows.


72
00:09:41.033 --> 00:09:44.151
- Christ is risen!
- Indeed He is risen.


73
00:09:44.353 --> 00:09:48.870
You said when the war was over
he'd write to tell us when he's coming.


74
00:09:49.073 --> 00:09:52.031
You said by Easter we'd get a letter.

75
00:09:55.153 --> 00:09:57.588
The war, the bombs,

76
00:09:57.793 --> 00:10:00.626
they destroyed all the post offices.

77
00:10:00.833 --> 00:10:04.303
The ships that carry the letters
across the sea were sunk.


78
00:10:04.513 --> 00:10:08.746
All these things take time to rebuild.

79
00:10:08.953 --> 00:10:11.149
Like our schoolhouse.

80
00:10:11.353 --> 00:10:13.549
It just takes time.

81
00:10:38.033 --> 00:10:40.707
Christ is risen, cousin.

82
00:11:18.433 --> 00:11:21.551
You're old enough
to stand with the men now.


83
00:11:21.753 --> 00:11:23.551
Go on.

84
00:12:39.673 --> 00:12:41.391
Nick?

85
00:12:41.593 --> 00:12:44.028
Are you all right?

86
00:12:45.113 --> 00:12:47.389
No, I'm not.

87
00:13:02.193 --> 00:13:05.948
Your father called me
after you left the house today.


88
00:13:06.153 --> 00:13:08.110
I thought he might.

89
00:13:11.193 --> 00:13:16.427
He thinks I have some influence
over you, being your wife and all.


90
00:13:16.633 --> 00:13:20.103
Don't give me that look!
How am I supposed to understand?


91
00:13:20.313 --> 00:13:22.873
I don't want to argue with you.

92
00:13:27.353 --> 00:13:31.904
Why do you have to go back?
We can work it out together here.


93
00:13:32.113 --> 00:13:34.866
Here is not the problem.

94
00:13:36.153 --> 00:13:39.544
What are you going to do in Athens?

95
00:13:39.753 --> 00:13:42.586
What I normally do. 
I report stories.

96
00:13:42.793 --> 00:13:45.103
- What stories?
- All kinds.


97
00:13:45.313 --> 00:13:48.704
Yeah, about former Civil War criminals
returning after 30...


98
00:13:48.913 --> 00:13:50.904
I'm aware of that.

99
00:13:53.113 --> 00:13:56.344
Maybe they're all dead.

100
00:13:56.553 --> 00:13:59.671
Gosh, I hope not.

101
00:13:59.873 --> 00:14:03.025
If they aren't, what will you do
with these old men?


102
00:14:03.233 --> 00:14:06.271
Probe them a bit,
ask them a few questions.


103
00:14:06.473 --> 00:14:11.752
- What if they don't answer?
- Then I'll rephrase the question.


104
00:14:22.513 --> 00:14:29.032
Nick, is it a requirement of being
a bureau chief in Athens to carry a gun?


105
00:14:29.233 --> 00:14:30.871
Is it?

106
00:14:32.353 --> 00:14:36.984
It used to be in the study,
then it disappeared. Where is it?


107
00:14:40.953 --> 00:14:44.548
Is that how you'll ask questions,
with a gun?


108
00:14:47.233 --> 00:14:52.751
No, you're a reporter, you don't have
to answer questions, just ask them.


109
00:14:56.553 --> 00:15:01.753
- Nick, I know about your mother...
- I don't think you do.


110
00:15:01.953 --> 00:15:06.948
You want to ruin everything over
something from some 30 years ago?


111
00:15:07.153 --> 00:15:10.305
"Some 30 years ago"? "Some"?

112
00:15:11.233 --> 00:15:14.510
People don't get murdered
at "some" point in time.


113
00:15:14.713 --> 00:15:16.431
It wasn't "some" to her.

114
00:15:16.633 --> 00:15:23.232
It was a specific year,
month, day, hour, minute.


115
00:15:23.433 --> 00:15:25.993
A specific second
when the trigger was pulled.


116
00:15:26.193 --> 00:15:29.549
Even then she was alive
until a split second later.


117
00:15:29.753 --> 00:15:32.063
The bullet ended her life.

118
00:15:32.273 --> 00:15:34.150
It wasn't "some" to her.

119
00:15:34.353 --> 00:15:36.503
Not "some" at all.

120
00:15:41.313 --> 00:15:45.864
Before there was England,
there was Greece.


121
00:15:46.073 --> 00:15:50.067
Before there was America,
there was Greece.


122
00:15:50.273 --> 00:15:55.029
And long before Greece
was a monarchy,


123
00:15:55.233 --> 00:15:57.873
W6 WGFG a democracy.

124
00:15:59.673 --> 00:16:03.382
What is another name for a democracy?

125
00:16:05.073 --> 00:16:08.031
- Republic.
- That's right.


126
00:16:08.233 --> 00:16:12.943
And the Union of Soviet
Socialist Republics


127
00:16:13.153 --> 00:16:14.985
is a democracy.

128
00:16:15.193 --> 00:16:20.552
In a democracy,
all of us play an important part.


129
00:16:20.753 --> 00:16:22.426
We...

130
00:16:22.633 --> 00:16:25.352
We pass laws.

131
00:16:26.433 --> 00:16:28.310
And we obey them.

132
00:16:36.553 --> 00:16:40.433
If you went home after school,

133
00:16:40.633 --> 00:16:46.185
the doors were closed and your parents
wouldn't let you inside ever again,


134
00:16:46.393 --> 00:16:49.511
could you still believe
they really loved you?


135
00:16:49.713 --> 00:16:51.909
No.

136
00:16:52.113 --> 00:16:57.586
No. Well, the King,
from inside his palace,


137
00:16:57.793 --> 00:17:01.627
says he loves his people.

138
00:17:01.833 --> 00:17:03.107
Spiro!

139
00:17:41.353 --> 00:17:43.071
Where's your teacher?

140
00:17:43.273 --> 00:17:46.425
You, that way! Go that way!

141
00:18:10.953 --> 00:18:14.912
- Good evening, Eleni.
- Good evening, Katina.


142
00:18:17.113 --> 00:18:20.947
The government militia is arresting
all the communists.


143
00:18:21.153 --> 00:18:23.713
- Spiro is my cousin.
- I know that.


144
00:18:23.913 --> 00:18:28.032
I'd hide him in my house,
but that'd be the first place they'd look.


145
00:18:28.233 --> 00:18:30.793
- Sol beg you...
- And if they find him here?


146
00:18:30.993 --> 00:18:33.382
They won't search your house.

147
00:18:33.593 --> 00:18:37.109
Your father's a monarchist,
your husband's in America.


148
00:18:37.313 --> 00:18:40.032
Everyone knows
where your sympathies lie.


149
00:18:40.233 --> 00:18:41.871
My Sympathies?

150
00:18:42.073 --> 00:18:45.304
I have no sympathies, as you call them.

151
00:18:45.513 --> 00:18:50.792
Then I seek refuge in the only
neutral house in all of Greece.


152
00:18:57.273 --> 00:19:03.110
You'll have to stay in the cellar.
I have grown daughters, you understand.


153
00:19:14.513 --> 00:19:17.551
I'm sorry you're in trouble, Spiro.

154
00:19:17.753 --> 00:19:22.463
But I do enjoy this sneaking around
at night. It makes me feel young!


155
00:19:22.673 --> 00:19:24.903
Give me a kiss, cousin.

156
00:19:29.713 --> 00:19:32.182
Be careful, Eleni.

157
00:19:34.353 --> 00:19:37.072
He kisses very nice.

158
00:19:41.073 --> 00:19:43.223
I'm a teacher, Eleni.

159
00:19:43.433 --> 00:19:46.186
I'm not a revolutionary.

160
00:19:46.913 --> 00:19:51.225
They're turning me into one because
I want to teach that everyone is a king.


161
00:19:51.433 --> 00:19:54.107
And a king is just another human being.

162
00:19:54.313 --> 00:19:56.304
What's wrong with that?

163
00:19:56.513 --> 00:19:58.504
I don't know. Please.

164
00:20:01.513 --> 00:20:03.231
Thank you, Eleni.

165
00:21:15.513 --> 00:21:19.427
How did you find out about me?
I've only been here a week.


166
00:21:19.633 --> 00:21:23.342
It will only take a few minutes.
It's a wonderful story.


167
00:21:23.553 --> 00:21:27.547
A Greek boy goes to America, he returns
as the "New York Times" bureau chief


168
00:21:27.753 --> 00:21:29.983
to write about his native land.

169
00:21:30.193 --> 00:21:34.107
It would make me happy
if you'd appear with me on TV.


170
00:21:34.313 --> 00:21:36.987
Well, in that case...

171
00:21:37.193 --> 00:21:38.467
Gentlemen!

172
00:21:51.953 --> 00:21:53.591
Nikola!

173
00:21:53.793 --> 00:21:55.352
- Nikola!
- Yes!


174
00:21:55.553 --> 00:21:58.784
He's alive! Your father is alive!

175
00:21:58.993 --> 00:22:02.509
America! We're going to America!

176
00:23:05.553 --> 00:23:07.908
- Can I go, Mana?
- Whoa.


177
00:23:08.113 --> 00:23:09.831
Yes, go on.

178
00:23:16.953 --> 00:23:18.227
Georgia...

179
00:23:19.913 --> 00:23:22.712
Ana, for the baby.

180
00:23:29.753 --> 00:23:31.551
Open m

181
00:23:32.553 --> 00:23:35.511
- Open it!
- Where's she going?


182
00:23:37.193 --> 00:23:40.311
- What was that?
- Probably dollars.


183
00:23:40.513 --> 00:23:43.153
There's no telling
how many in one envelope.


184
00:24:06.833 --> 00:24:09.222
"My dear wife,

185
00:24:10.033 --> 00:24:12.468
"my dearest daughters,

186
00:24:13.833 --> 00:24:17.064
"and you, Nikola,

187
00:24:17.273 --> 00:24:20.550
"my son whom I have not seen..."

188
00:24:43.233 --> 00:24:48.228
"Business was good, then it was bad,
and soon I think it will be good again.


189
00:24:48.433 --> 00:24:52.063
"L will start looking
for a house for us all.


190
00:24:52.273 --> 00:24:54.913
"L have become a citizen of America..."

191
00:24:55.113 --> 00:24:59.311
- Imagine that!
- He's not Greek any more?


192
00:24:59.513 --> 00:25:02.551
It says,
"l have become a citizen of America.


193
00:25:02.753 --> 00:25:04.824
"L am no longer a foreigner

194
00:25:05.033 --> 00:25:09.664
"and I can now vote for President
and Mayor of New York.


195
00:25:09.873 --> 00:25:14.265
"Eleni, my beautiful and loving wife,

196
00:25:14.473 --> 00:25:20.264
"take good care of our children while
I work and save money for our home.


197
00:25:21.473 --> 00:25:23.942
"All of you live in my heart.

198
00:25:24.153 --> 00:25:27.589
"And soon I hope to see and embrace...

199
00:25:30.073 --> 00:25:33.464
"...and embrace each one of you.

200
00:25:33.673 --> 00:25:38.224
"L kiss your eyes
and those of my angel children.


201
00:25:39.393 --> 00:25:43.944
"L, your loving husband, write this."

202
00:25:47.713 --> 00:25:52.344
How will I speak to Father
when we go to America?


203
00:25:52.553 --> 00:25:54.669
What do you mean?

204
00:25:54.873 --> 00:25:56.193
I'm worried.

205
00:25:56.393 --> 00:26:00.352
He's been there a long time,
and maybe he only speaks American.


206
00:26:00.553 --> 00:26:05.468
- Maybe he forgot Greek.
- No, I wouldn't worry about that.


207
00:26:05.673 --> 00:26:08.950
I think we should go there soon,
just in case.


208
00:26:09.153 --> 00:26:13.067
Why don't we surprise him?
"Hello, Father, here we all are!"


209
00:26:15.433 --> 00:26:19.347
It's a long way, you know.
It's across the ocean.


210
00:26:19.553 --> 00:26:22.272
You have to have an invitation.

211
00:26:22.473 --> 00:26:27.229
When you get to America, they say,
"Who invited you to come?"


212
00:26:27.433 --> 00:26:29.071
Like to a wedding.

213
00:26:30.273 --> 00:26:34.949
But if he loves us,
why doesn't he send us an invitation?


214
00:26:35.153 --> 00:26:39.033
Because he's saving all his money
to build us a fine house


215
00:26:39.233 --> 00:26:41.588
with enough rooms for everybody.

216
00:26:41.793 --> 00:26:45.070
I know the problem:
there's too many of us.


217
00:26:45.273 --> 00:26:48.106
- You have too many children.
- No.


218
00:26:48.313 --> 00:26:50.350
I need all my children.

219
00:26:52.033 --> 00:26:53.990
But when we go to America,

220
00:26:54.193 --> 00:26:58.505
will Father call you
"my beautiful and loving wife"?


221
00:26:58.713 --> 00:27:01.910
- What, like in the letter?
- Yes.


222
00:27:02.113 --> 00:27:04.502
Well, I hope so.

223
00:27:07.313 --> 00:27:09.748
Maybe you will only love him.

224
00:27:09.953 --> 00:27:12.911
And you won't love me any more.

225
00:27:13.113 --> 00:27:14.626
No.

226
00:27:17.753 --> 00:27:20.142
I will always love you.

227
00:27:21.753 --> 00:27:23.312
Why?

228
00:28:30.313 --> 00:28:31.587
Nick!

229
00:28:33.833 --> 00:28:35.471
Hey, Nick, here it is.

230
00:28:35.673 --> 00:28:39.462
I never forget a funeral.
He died of cancer a few months ago.


231
00:28:39.673 --> 00:28:42.825
- Did you know him?
- Yeah, he was my school teacher.


232
00:28:43.033 --> 00:28:45.183
- Is this a coincidence or what?
- What?


233
00:28:45.393 --> 00:28:48.112
All these dudes were Civil War criminals.

234
00:28:48.313 --> 00:28:51.305
I'm thinking about doing an article
on their return to Greece.


235
00:28:51.513 --> 00:28:54.346
Oh, yeah? I already did that story.

236
00:28:54.553 --> 00:28:56.783
It's been out for a while.
You haven't read it?


237
00:28:56.993 --> 00:28:58.472
Idid.

238
00:28:58.673 --> 00:29:01.791
- Yeah? What was wrong with it?
- Too general.


239
00:29:01.993 --> 00:29:05.111
- Too general for whom?
- For me.


240
00:29:06.993 --> 00:29:09.906
- Were you really born in Greece?
- Yes.


241
00:29:10.113 --> 00:29:13.151
That explains your sunny
Mediterranean personality!


242
00:29:13.353 --> 00:29:16.505
This guy insists on talking to you, Nick.
He saw you on TV.


243
00:29:16.713 --> 00:29:21.105
That's great. The bureau chief of
the "New York Times" is a TV personality.


244
00:29:21.313 --> 00:29:23.190
Lay off. Who is it?

245
00:29:23.393 --> 00:29:27.990
He says you grew up together.
His name's Antoni Makos.


246
00:29:33.593 --> 00:29:35.630
Hello?

247
00:30:19.473 --> 00:30:22.192
This is my old friend,
Nikola Gatzoyiannis.


248
00:30:25.753 --> 00:30:28.745
We grew up in the same village.

249
00:30:28.953 --> 00:30:32.662
We used to have sword fights,
remember, Nikola?


250
00:30:34.393 --> 00:30:37.431
We saw our first aeroplane together.

251
00:30:39.113 --> 00:30:41.309
And now he's an American.

252
00:30:43.793 --> 00:30:45.272
Nikola!

253
00:30:53.673 --> 00:30:56.142
I thought we were going to talk
about old times.


254
00:30:56.353 --> 00:31:00.870
These are old times. I didn't know you'd
seen my mother when I came here.


255
00:31:01.073 --> 00:31:03.064
I'm sorry I mentioned it.

256
00:31:03.273 --> 00:31:07.426
Go on. You said you were drinking
water at the spring.


257
00:31:07.633 --> 00:31:11.024
She looked at me,
you know, in that way.

258
00:31:11.233 --> 00:31:13.349
What way?

259
00:31:15.593 --> 00:31:18.107
You know what children
meant to our mothers.


260
00:31:18.313 --> 00:31:23.911
They see a boy who's not even theirs
and they look at him in that way.


261
00:31:24.113 --> 00:31:26.184
That's how she...

262
00:31:27.193 --> 00:31:29.833
You're an educated man.

263
00:31:30.033 --> 00:31:33.913
Why do you think
our mothers loved us so much?


264
00:31:34.113 --> 00:31:38.983
I have children of my own,
but I find it hard to...


265
00:31:39.193 --> 00:31:41.707
Do you have children?

266
00:31:41.913 --> 00:31:45.349
Did my mother say anything to you?

267
00:31:47.153 --> 00:31:48.905
No.

268
00:31:54.913 --> 00:31:59.271
- Do you go to Lia often?
- I don't go back now.


269
00:31:59.473 --> 00:32:04.343
I went back once a few years ago.
Spent the night in loannina.


270
00:32:04.553 --> 00:32:06.908
- I saw that man.
- What man?


271
00:32:07.113 --> 00:32:11.152
That guerrilla who led the prisoners
to the execution site.


272
00:32:11.353 --> 00:32:17.907
- Are you sure it was him?
- He said he was stationed in our village.


273
00:32:18.113 --> 00:32:20.263
Do you know his name?

274
00:32:20.473 --> 00:32:24.387
Tasso Levendis.
He didn't remember me.


275
00:32:24.593 --> 00:32:27.107
Does he still live in loannina?

276
00:32:27.313 --> 00:32:28.712
Don't know.

277
00:32:28.913 --> 00:32:32.349
When I saw him,
he was in a bar, pimping,


278
00:32:32.553 --> 00:32:34.783
offering me women.

279
00:33:32.193 --> 00:33:33.911
Listen!

280
00:33:34.113 --> 00:33:35.467
Listen!

281
00:33:37.153 --> 00:33:38.712
Listen!

282
00:33:38.913 --> 00:33:42.031
The government is warning
all the people in this area


283
00:33:42.233 --> 00:33:44.873
that we can no longer protect you.

284
00:33:45.073 --> 00:33:50.068
Communist guerrillas are advancing.
Civil war has begun.


285
00:33:53.633 --> 00:33:55.943
Father, what should I do?

286
00:33:56.153 --> 00:33:59.191
You? What are you afraid of?
You're a woman!


287
00:33:59.393 --> 00:34:02.829
It's me they'll kill first.
They know I'm for the King.


288
00:34:03.033 --> 00:34:05.070
Long live the King.

289
00:34:05.273 --> 00:34:06.786
Goodbye.

290
00:34:09.593 --> 00:34:13.427
- Mother, should we go to loannina?
- Who'll look after your home?


291
00:34:13.633 --> 00:34:17.911
- It's your duty to look after your home.
- Yes, but my children...


292
00:34:18.113 --> 00:34:20.946
These aren't Germans,
Turks or Albanians.


293
00:34:21.153 --> 00:34:25.670
They're our own people.
They won't harm women and children.


294
00:34:30.793 --> 00:34:32.511
Lukas?

295
00:34:33.873 --> 00:34:35.864
- Lukas, are you staying?
- Yes.


296
00:34:36.073 --> 00:34:40.465
My wife has convinced me
I'm too worthless for the communists.


297
00:34:42.633 --> 00:34:46.513
If they kill me,
it'll prove how wrong she is!


298
00:34:46.713 --> 00:34:48.545
It's finally come to this.

299
00:34:48.753 --> 00:34:53.145
We've been invaded by everybody.
Now we're being invaded by ourselves.


300
00:34:58.713 --> 00:35:00.909
Go. Go quickly.

301
00:35:16.193 --> 00:35:17.866
People of Lia!

302
00:35:18.953 --> 00:35:20.512
People of Lia!

303
00:35:23.153 --> 00:35:26.589
You have nothing to be afraid of!

304
00:35:26.793 --> 00:35:29.751
We have come to liberate you...

305
00:35:31.633 --> 00:35:34.147
...in the name of the new Greece!

306
00:35:37.433 --> 00:35:39.663
Everybody in the house.

307
00:36:13.113 --> 00:36:14.547
Out!

308
00:36:19.593 --> 00:36:22.153
Everybody out! Out!

309
00:36:22.353 --> 00:36:24.549
- Come on, Mother.
- Come on!


310
00:36:24.753 --> 00:36:27.222
We won't see you in any harm.

311
00:36:28.313 --> 00:36:30.350
Outside!

312
00:36:30.553 --> 00:36:32.829
Everybody outside!

313
00:36:55.713 --> 00:36:58.512
Spiro. Thank God it's you.

314
00:36:58.713 --> 00:37:03.344
Major Spiro Skevis,
Democratic Army of Greece.


315
00:37:03.553 --> 00:37:07.148
I have the honour to inform you
this village has been liberated.


316
00:37:07.353 --> 00:37:13.031
Your house has been chosen
to be the HQ of the Army of Liberation.


317
00:37:13.233 --> 00:37:16.749
You'll be out of the house
by tomorrow morning.


318
00:37:16.953 --> 00:37:21.584
But Spiro, don't you remember
when Katina brought you here?


319
00:37:22.393 --> 00:37:23.906
I remember.

320
00:37:24.873 --> 00:37:28.548
Be out of the house
by tomorrow, Americana.


321
00:38:21.313 --> 00:38:23.953
It's only a house.

322
00:38:24.153 --> 00:38:27.225
It's just stone and mortar.

323
00:38:28.113 --> 00:38:30.866
And wood and glass.

324
00:38:33.353 --> 00:38:37.506
All of you were born here
and so that makes it special.


325
00:38:37.713 --> 00:38:41.308
Memories make it special.

326
00:38:41.513 --> 00:38:44.904
But we can take those wherever we go.

327
00:38:46.473 --> 00:38:48.749
Some day,

328
00:38:48.953 --> 00:38:52.628
we'll all be together like this,
all packed and ready.


329
00:38:52.833 --> 00:38:58.385
And instead of moving to Grandmother's,
we'll be leaving across the ocean


330
00:38:58.593 --> 00:39:01.551
where your father is waiting for us.

331
00:39:02.953 --> 00:39:06.025
It will feel just like this.

332
00:39:06.233 --> 00:39:10.704
We'll take our belongings
and our memories,


333
00:39:10.913 --> 00:39:14.031
and we'll leave this house for ever.

334
00:39:15.473 --> 00:39:19.432
But we won't be sad,
because we'll all be together.


335
00:39:20.673 --> 00:39:23.506
That's what's important.

336
00:39:23.713 --> 00:39:27.183
We mustn't be sad tomorrow.

337
00:39:30.353 --> 00:39:32.947
Take 'em in there!

338
00:39:46.073 --> 00:39:49.384
Animals and food stay behind.

339
00:39:53.433 --> 00:39:55.629
I have a family to feed.

340
00:39:55.833 --> 00:39:57.790
I have an army to feed.

341
00:39:59.753 --> 00:40:04.224
Anyone hiding food will be shot.
Those are our orders.


342
00:40:07.153 --> 00:40:11.465
- I will obey your orders.
- Mana, what will we eat?


343
00:40:22.033 --> 00:40:24.229
One thing more, Americana!

344
00:40:24.433 --> 00:40:27.710
All your able-bodied men have fled.

345
00:40:27.913 --> 00:40:30.109
I need soldiers.

346
00:40:30.313 --> 00:40:34.546
Each household will volunteer their
eldest daughter to fight for the army.


347
00:40:34.753 --> 00:40:37.552
Olga, you will have the privilege.

348
00:40:37.753 --> 00:40:39.391
Spiro...

349
00:40:39.593 --> 00:40:44.303
Major Skevis,
I gave you my house and food.


350
00:40:44.513 --> 00:40:48.871
But Olga knows nothing about fighting.
Please, I beg you.


351
00:40:49.073 --> 00:40:52.543
We will teach her. You've two days
together, then she's ours.


352
00:40:52.753 --> 00:40:54.152
- Mana...
- Sh!


353
00:40:55.473 --> 00:40:58.431
We're at war and those are orders.

354
00:40:58.633 --> 00:41:03.787
Anyone who disobeys will be
dealt with accordingly. Understood?


355
00:41:06.873 --> 00:41:09.547
We will obey your orders.

356
00:41:22.273 --> 00:41:23.547
Mana!

357
00:41:25.033 --> 00:41:28.151
Mana, don't let them take me away...!

358
00:41:28.353 --> 00:41:31.345
What do you think I can do?

359
00:41:54.633 --> 00:41:56.544
Olga.

360
00:41:56.753 --> 00:41:59.347
They had to do
this in the old days.

361
00:41:59.553 --> 00:42:04.229
The Ottoman Turks came
gathering all the boys for their armies.


362
00:42:04.433 --> 00:42:07.710
To save them,
their mothers cut off their fingers.


363
00:42:07.913 --> 00:42:11.190
Sometimes they gouged out
one of their eyes.


364
00:42:11.393 --> 00:42:15.273
I won't be a cripple, will I?
I'll never marry if...


365
00:42:21.753 --> 00:42:23.710
No, Mana!

366
00:42:28.433 --> 00:42:31.551
Where is your husband, Mother?

367
00:42:31.753 --> 00:42:34.905
Where is my father?

368
00:42:35.113 --> 00:42:40.506
Where is her father and my husband?
Where are our men?


369
00:42:41.873 --> 00:42:44.626
Have I been told lies all my life?

370
00:42:44.833 --> 00:42:48.747
Eleni! You're a woman,
you're forgetting your place!


371
00:42:48.953 --> 00:42:53.345
Is this my place, Mother,
to torture my own child?


372
00:42:53.553 --> 00:42:56.545
Is it my place to stay behind?

373
00:42:56.753 --> 00:42:59.984
Always to stay behind
when our men run off?


374
00:43:00.193 --> 00:43:02.184
In return for what?

375
00:43:02.393 --> 00:43:04.669
Mana!

376
00:43:04.873 --> 00:43:06.546
No!

377
00:43:10.593 --> 00:43:14.871
They put me in charge
of food supply, so I...


378
00:43:23.793 --> 00:43:27.502
- How could you?
- They were going to take her!


379
00:43:27.713 --> 00:43:30.512
They? What they?

380
00:43:30.713 --> 00:43:34.946
- I've tried to save my child!
- These are our own people.


381
00:43:35.153 --> 00:43:37.429
Don't! My child...

382
00:43:37.633 --> 00:43:41.831
Yes. But not some animal to be hobbled.

383
00:43:42.033 --> 00:43:46.425
Get out! Take your food
and your advice and get out!


384
00:44:11.073 --> 00:44:15.271
Olga Gatzoyiannis is requested to join
the People's Democratic Army.


385
00:44:15.473 --> 00:44:17.783
Major Skevis... please.

386
00:44:23.273 --> 00:44:28.109
My daughter is so clumsy,
she spilled boiling water on her leg.


387
00:44:29.433 --> 00:44:32.664
She can hardly stand.

388
00:44:53.193 --> 00:44:55.503
Remove the bandages.

389
00:45:23.873 --> 00:45:28.026
You should teach your daughter
to be more careful, Americana.


390
00:45:34.153 --> 00:45:41.071
All unmarried girls over 15 may
join the People's Democratic Army.


391
00:45:41.273 --> 00:45:44.743
Have your daughter Glykeria
prepare to leave.


392
00:45:44.953 --> 00:45:47.991
And be careful, Americana,
no more accidents.


393
00:46:42.073 --> 00:46:45.862
You must be the famous
Tasso Levendis.


394
00:46:46.073 --> 00:46:49.384
I hear that if you want a woman
you're the man to see.


395
00:46:49.593 --> 00:46:51.664
I know some women, yes.

396
00:46:51.873 --> 00:46:54.547
Money's no object.

397
00:46:54.753 --> 00:46:57.313
I know a lot of women.

398
00:46:57.513 --> 00:47:00.312
Let's get in my
car and take a drive.

399
00:47:01.513 --> 00:47:03.709
You have a car.

400
00:47:16.233 --> 00:47:21.103
- You've missed a turn there.
- I want to go home first for more money.


401
00:47:35.313 --> 00:47:37.429
Where's your home?

402
00:47:37.633 --> 00:47:40.512
A little village called Lia.

403
00:47:40.713 --> 00:47:44.786
Lia? Are you crazy?
It's over 50 kilometres from here!


404
00:47:44.993 --> 00:47:48.748
You know the place?
You've been there before?


405
00:47:50.273 --> 00:47:52.787
Hey, what's going on?

406
00:47:54.833 --> 00:47:57.347
Who the hell are you?

407
00:48:00.193 --> 00:48:04.152
I wouldn't do that if I were you,
unless you want to bounce.


408
00:48:06.393 --> 00:48:08.589
- I saw that man.
- What man?


409
00:48:08.793 --> 00:48:13.310
That guerrilla who led the prisoners
to the execution site.


410
00:48:13.513 --> 00:48:16.073
- Are you sure it was him?
- I really wasn't.


411
00:48:16.273 --> 00:48:19.868
So l talked to him and he said
he was stationed in our village.


412
00:48:20.073 --> 00:48:22.030
Do you know his name?

413
00:48:22.233 --> 00:48:24.827
Tasso Levendis.

414
00:48:41.753 --> 00:48:43.027
Get out.

415
00:49:03.393 --> 00:49:09.025
I was not on the execution squad.
I just brought the prisoners to the site.


416
00:49:09.233 --> 00:49:12.430
Your mother had a trial.
The judge ordered her confession.


417
00:49:12.633 --> 00:49:15.227
The judge sentenced her to death.
It was legal!


418
00:49:15.433 --> 00:49:18.312
- She was tortured.
- Torture, too, was legal!


419
00:49:18.513 --> 00:49:21.471
- Who gave the order?
- The same judge.


420
00:49:21.673 --> 00:49:25.223
- His name?
- His revolutionary name was Katis.


421
00:49:25.433 --> 00:49:27.868
- I don't know his name!
- Where is he?


422
00:49:28.073 --> 00:49:30.667
I don't even know if he's alive!

423
00:49:30.873 --> 00:49:36.027
- Where did he hide after the war?
- Czechoslovakia, when we lost the war.


424
00:49:36.233 --> 00:49:38.622
Some people from your village
went with us.


425
00:49:38.833 --> 00:49:42.792
- Where in Czechoslovakia?
- Bratislava!


426
00:49:51.793 --> 00:49:56.151
It's too late!
Even if you find him, you won't find him.


427
00:49:56.353 --> 00:49:58.822
You'll find an old man
who used to be Katis.


428
00:49:59.033 --> 00:50:05.143
Just like you found me, an old pimp,
who used to be a soldier!


429
00:50:05.353 --> 00:50:09.187
If you live long enough,
it seems you cease to exist!


430
00:50:09.393 --> 00:50:10.952
You're too late!

431
00:50:11.153 --> 00:50:14.111
We're all dead and gone!

432
00:50:23.073 --> 00:50:27.192
One, two, three, four...

433
00:50:44.313 --> 00:50:48.830
One, two, three, four...

434
00:50:49.033 --> 00:50:51.547
Quicker! Quicker!

435
00:50:51.753 --> 00:50:53.710
...three, four...

436
00:51:18.233 --> 00:51:20.031
Careful!

437
00:53:25.073 --> 00:53:26.950
Who are you?

438
00:53:27.153 --> 00:53:30.305
Eleni Gatzoyiannis,
wife of Christos, from Lia.


439
00:53:30.513 --> 00:53:34.472
- Come with us, you're saved.
- I can't. My children.


440
00:53:42.633 --> 00:53:46.263
No! No! My children!

441
00:54:36.793 --> 00:54:40.787
These people you're looking for,
they're relatives?


442
00:54:40.993 --> 00:54:44.987
Well, relatives and friends
from my village.


443
00:54:45.193 --> 00:54:49.744
I've been told that they fled here
after the Greek Civil War.


444
00:54:49.953 --> 00:54:52.866
Yes, we have many Greeks living here.

445
00:54:53.073 --> 00:54:54.427
Too many.

446
00:54:57.033 --> 00:55:01.027
First, we kept the records in order,
but as you can see...


447
00:55:01.233 --> 00:55:04.703
If you find any relatives,
take them with you.


448
00:55:54.321 --> 00:55:55.675
Next!

449
00:55:58.601 --> 00:56:00.194
Name?

450
00:56:00.401 --> 00:56:02.711
Gatzoyiannis.

451
00:56:02.921 --> 00:56:04.241
Go ahead.

452
00:56:04.441 --> 00:56:06.079
Next!

453
00:56:06.321 --> 00:56:07.994
Move on!

454
00:56:38.641 --> 00:56:40.678
Comrades.

455
00:56:40.881 --> 00:56:42.554
Comrades!

456
00:56:43.601 --> 00:56:48.801
I welcome you in the name
of the Democratic Army of Greece.


457
00:56:55.321 --> 00:56:57.198
Mothers of Lia,

458
00:56:58.601 --> 00:57:01.434
your children are in danger.

459
00:57:02.641 --> 00:57:07.431
The fascist government's attacks
on your village will continue.


460
00:57:08.681 --> 00:57:13.039
If your children are not killed
by bombs or bullets...


461
00:57:15.121 --> 00:57:18.079
they'll die slowly from starvation.

462
00:57:19.001 --> 00:57:25.031
What little food we have left
has to be rationed out to our fighters.


463
00:57:28.041 --> 00:57:33.673
But... because of
the party's great concern


464
00:57:34.721 --> 00:57:36.553
and love for your children,

465
00:57:36.761 --> 00:57:40.516
our leaders have found
a way to save them.


466
00:57:45.241 --> 00:57:48.472
We've called you all here today
to announce


467
00:57:48.681 --> 00:57:54.074
that the People's Democracies
of Albania and Czechoslovakia


468
00:57:54.281 --> 00:57:57.876
have opened their arms to your children.

469
00:57:58.081 --> 00:58:02.120
They will take them,
care for them, feed them well.


470
00:58:02.321 --> 00:58:07.395
And educate them to become
lawyers, doctors, engineers.


471
00:58:07.601 --> 00:58:09.592
Whatever their talents permit.

472
00:58:09.801 --> 00:58:13.351
And when the civil war is over
and the red flag flies,


473
00:58:13.561 --> 00:58:15.791
they will come back to you,

474
00:58:16.001 --> 00:58:19.312
tall, healthy, happy.

475
00:58:19.521 --> 00:58:23.480
Ready to take their place
in the new Greece.


476
00:58:24.921 --> 00:58:28.994
Who will be the first
to volunteer her children?


477
00:58:34.961 --> 00:58:37.350
Who will be the first?

478
00:58:41.161 --> 00:58:43.994
Katina, for the love of God!

479
00:58:45.921 --> 00:58:49.596
We have our first patriotic mother.

480
00:58:50.921 --> 00:58:53.276
Katina Skevis.

481
00:58:54.321 --> 00:58:56.881
You wish to volunteer, 
Comrade Skevis?

482
00:58:57.081 --> 00:58:58.913
Yes.

483
00:58:59.121 --> 00:59:03.558
I would like to volunteer some advice

484
00:59:03.761 --> 00:59:07.197
to you, Mr Comrade
-In
-A
-Blue
-Suit.

485
00:59:08.881 --> 00:59:14.479
My husband died in the war,
fighting for your cause.


486
00:59:14.681 --> 00:59:20.632
I carried on the dream
he whispered to me once in the night


487
00:59:20.841 --> 00:59:24.232
of a better life for my children.

488
00:59:27.041 --> 00:59:29.794
My children.

489
00:59:30.881 --> 00:59:33.555
Not yours.

490
00:59:33.761 --> 00:59:36.275
Not the party's.

491
00:59:36.481 --> 00:59:42.432
Not the People's Democracies
of Albania or anywhere.


492
00:59:43.321 --> 00:59:44.675
Mine.

493
00:59:46.641 --> 00:59:51.158
No mother will give up her children.

494
00:59:58.801 --> 01:00:05.480
There are no volunteers... here.

495
01:01:06.961 --> 01:01:09.760
Mothers of Lia,

496
01:01:09.961 --> 01:01:12.919
you know your children are hungry.

497
01:01:20.681 --> 01:01:24.390
Your children can eat like this...

498
01:01:26.241 --> 01:01:28.152
...every daw-

499
01:01:30.001 --> 01:01:32.470
...if you let them go.

500
01:01:40.281 --> 01:01:43.831
Any child who steps forward
at this moment...


501
01:01:44.761 --> 01:01:50.598
...can have as much bread and
marmalade as he or she can eat.


502
01:01:57.881 --> 01:02:00.555
- Mana, I'm so hungry.
- No.


503
01:02:03.041 --> 01:02:05.794
Left the country. Albania.

504
01:02:06.841 --> 01:02:08.832
Dead.

505
01:02:10.681 --> 01:02:13.400
Left the country. Soviet Union.

506
01:02:14.721 --> 01:02:19.670
She's still here.
Not as pretty as she was in the picture.


507
01:02:21.321 --> 01:02:22.914
Dead.

508
01:02:28.881 --> 01:02:31.953
Left the country.

509
01:02:32.161 --> 01:02:33.515
Where?

510
01:02:33.721 --> 01:02:35.359
It doesn't say.

511
01:02:35.561 --> 01:02:38.075
- When?
- It doesn't say.


512
01:02:38.281 --> 01:02:41.672
- Was he a friend or a relative?
- A friend of the family.


513
01:02:41.881 --> 01:02:45.920
It says here he had no identification
on him. What was his full name?


514
01:02:46.121 --> 01:02:48.192
I just remember him by Katis.

515
01:02:48.401 --> 01:02:50.358
He's probably dead.

516
01:02:50.561 --> 01:02:53.121
I'm going off duty.

517
01:02:53.321 --> 01:02:57.280
If you want, I can tell you
where to find that woman.


518
01:03:49.961 --> 01:03:51.554
Yes?

519
01:03:51.761 --> 01:03:55.391
I'm looking for Ana Katroubis.

520
01:03:55.601 --> 01:03:57.319
Who are you?

521
01:03:57.521 --> 01:04:00.081
Nick... Nikola Gatzoyiannis.

522
01:04:03.121 --> 01:04:06.239
- Eleni's son?
- Yes.


523
01:04:23.521 --> 01:04:26.400
What do you want from me?

524
01:04:26.601 --> 01:04:30.515
You must know I
didn't do it on purpose.

525
01:04:32.321 --> 01:04:37.441
I was forced to testify against
your mother. You must know that.


526
01:04:37.641 --> 01:04:39.552
Yes, l... l knew that.

527
01:04:39.761 --> 01:04:42.640
I didn't come here
to blame you for anything.


528
01:04:42.841 --> 01:04:45.594
I did it to save my son.

529
01:04:45.801 --> 01:04:51.001
The judge, he told me I had to join
the guerrillas, to be a soldier.


530
01:04:51.201 --> 01:04:55.832
My baby would have died.
There was nobody to look after him.


531
01:04:57.801 --> 01:05:03.319
So I sinned against my soul
to save my child.


532
01:05:03.521 --> 01:05:06.752
I understand that you had no choice.

533
01:05:08.801 --> 01:05:12.112
The judge, what was his name?

534
01:05:12.321 --> 01:05:16.280
- Stavros Petrakis.
- He called himself Katis at the time.


535
01:05:18.161 --> 01:05:23.679
The officials at the bureau told me
that he had died a few years ago.


536
01:05:24.721 --> 01:05:29.079
They don't know anything.
He's back in Greece!


537
01:05:29.281 --> 01:05:33.559
We're too ashamed to return,
but he's not?


538
01:05:35.241 --> 01:05:37.960
Where in Greece is he?

539
01:05:40.561 --> 01:05:43.280
Where in Greece is he?

540
01:06:23.801 --> 01:06:26.077
Mana! Mana!

541
01:06:27.001 --> 01:06:30.278
Mana! Mana! Mana!

542
01:06:42.001 --> 01:06:44.072
Eleni...

543
01:06:44.281 --> 01:06:45.555
Mana!

544
01:07:03.961 --> 01:07:05.440
Mana!

545
01:07:18.601 --> 01:07:21.434
They said "volunteers".

546
01:07:21.641 --> 01:07:25.077
We can only hope and pray.

547
01:07:25.281 --> 01:07:28.353
We must do more than hope, Mother.

548
01:07:38.841 --> 01:07:42.357
- If we do as we're told...
- No!


549
01:07:42.561 --> 01:07:47.874
Mother, you've brought me up
the best way you knew how.


550
01:07:49.041 --> 01:07:51.715
- The way I was raised.
- Yes.


551
01:07:52.881 --> 01:07:58.081
To obey and to know my place
and never to complain.


552
01:08:01.481 --> 01:08:04.599
And in all that sunshine of my life,

553
01:08:04.801 --> 01:08:09.159
I have lived in the shade
of somebody else's authority.


554
01:08:11.961 --> 01:08:14.953
There were flowers in my heart, Mother.

555
01:08:16.961 --> 01:08:21.512
But there are some flowers
that never blossom in the shade.


556
01:08:22.881 --> 01:08:25.839
It was the price I paid
to be like everyone else.


557
01:08:26.041 --> 01:08:29.318
I didn't complain,
and I'm not complaining now.


558
01:08:29.521 --> 01:08:33.071
But I am saying, "No more."

559
01:08:36.081 --> 01:08:38.641
They took our food.

560
01:08:38.841 --> 01:08:41.196
They took my home.

561
01:08:41.401 --> 01:08:43.438
They took my dignity.

562
01:08:43.641 --> 01:08:46.315
And I gave in at every turn.

563
01:08:46.521 --> 01:08:50.754
But I will not give them my children.

564
01:08:52.081 --> 01:08:55.278
They will not take them from me.

565
01:08:55.481 --> 01:08:58.200
Escape? Are you mad? 
With children?

566
01:08:58.401 --> 01:09:03.430
- There are guards and landmines!
- You know where the mines are.


567
01:09:03.641 --> 01:09:05.678
You know where the guards are.

568
01:09:05.881 --> 01:09:09.351
They've taken my Glykeria already.
I can't just wait.


569
01:09:09.561 --> 01:09:12.713
If we get caught, they'll kill us.

570
01:09:12.921 --> 01:09:16.118
If they take my children,
it'll be worse than dying.


571
01:09:16.321 --> 01:09:18.631
He doesn't understand. He's a man.

572
01:09:18.841 --> 01:09:21.594
Suddenly I'm promoted! I'm a man!

573
01:09:23.121 --> 01:09:27.080
- When were you planning?
- Tomorrow night.


574
01:09:27.281 --> 01:09:30.831
- I'm getting a headache.
- There's no time to lose.


575
01:09:31.041 --> 01:09:33.874
They might come for the children
at any moment.


576
01:09:34.081 --> 01:09:36.641
- Everyone would respect you.
- Please.


577
01:09:36.841 --> 01:09:39.833
No respect.
In Greece, only the dead are respected.


578
01:09:47.641 --> 01:09:50.360
Mana, soldiers are coming!

579
01:09:56.121 --> 01:09:59.079
Somebody betrayed us.

580
01:10:04.521 --> 01:10:08.355
We need a woman from your household
for a work detail.


581
01:10:08.561 --> 01:10:10.438
Yes, I'll come!

582
01:10:10.641 --> 01:10:13.838
Not now.
We're rounding everybody up first.


583
01:10:14.041 --> 01:10:17.079
Bring extra clothing
for three to four weeks.


584
01:10:17.281 --> 01:10:19.033
No, I can't!

585
01:10:19.241 --> 01:10:22.199
We leave in an hour. 
That's an order!

586
01:10:35.121 --> 01:10:39.752
They only want a woman to work.
I'll go in your place.


587
01:10:42.121 --> 01:10:45.591
They wouldn't take you, Mother,
you're too old.


588
01:10:48.201 --> 01:10:50.272
Oh, why now? Why today?

589
01:10:50.481 --> 01:10:53.758
We'll take care of everything
while you're gone.


590
01:10:53.961 --> 01:10:57.079
- When you come back...
- ...you'll be far away!


591
01:10:57.281 --> 01:10:59.875
You're all leaving tonight
just as we planned!


592
01:11:00.081 --> 01:11:04.518
Listen to me. We can't wait.
Three or four weeks is a long time.


593
01:11:04.721 --> 01:11:07.952
They could come
for Nikola or Fotini any day.


594
01:11:09.081 --> 01:11:10.833
Olga,

595
01:11:11.041 --> 01:11:13.191
listen to me.

596
01:11:13.401 --> 01:11:16.712
You are the oldest,
you must take my place.


597
01:11:17.641 --> 01:11:22.192
When you are safe, write to your father
and tell him what has happened.


598
01:11:22.401 --> 01:11:25.598
He will find a way to send for you.
He loves you.


599
01:11:25.801 --> 01:11:28.873
- Not like you, Mana.
- I'll be all right.


600
01:11:29.081 --> 01:11:32.551
It may be better this way.
I can help Glykeria escape.


601
01:11:32.761 --> 01:11:36.914
Then the two of us
will join you in America. We will!


602
01:11:39.041 --> 01:11:40.634
Come quickly!

603
01:11:40.841 --> 01:11:43.435
Gather round me
while we still have time.


604
01:11:43.641 --> 01:11:45.393
Sit down.

605
01:11:47.801 --> 01:11:50.236
Come on, sit down.

606
01:11:54.081 --> 01:11:57.676
You have never seen the sea.

607
01:11:57.881 --> 01:12:00.236
It's beautiful.

608
01:12:00.441 --> 01:12:04.833
It's big and blue
and endless as the sky.

609
01:12:06.321 --> 01:12:09.393
It makes you dream to look at it.

610
01:12:10.921 --> 01:12:16.473
And so you will dream of a new life
in your new home,


611
01:12:16.681 --> 01:12:18.638
and when you wake up,

612
01:12:18.841 --> 01:12:21.071
it will be there.

613
01:12:43.521 --> 01:12:46.195
You stay here.

614
01:12:46.401 --> 01:12:49.712
Don't let them see you cry.

615
01:12:56.601 --> 01:12:58.558
My children...

616
01:13:00.281 --> 01:13:02.716
...l bless you all.

617
01:14:08.481 --> 01:14:12.361
You must go away
and you must never come back.


618
01:14:14.121 --> 01:14:15.953
Do you understand me?

619
01:14:16.161 --> 01:14:17.515
Yes, Mana.

620
01:14:18.561 --> 01:14:20.950
Here, take this.

621
01:14:21.921 --> 01:14:25.118
When you are safe, throw it behind you.

622
01:14:25.321 --> 01:14:29.474
When you throw a black stone,
it means you will never return.


623
01:14:29.681 --> 01:14:32.150
Promise me you will do this.

624
01:14:32.361 --> 01:14:35.080
I promise.

625
01:14:36.961 --> 01:14:40.158
Kiss me this one time.

626
01:14:51.001 --> 01:14:53.595
My heart and blood.

627
01:16:20.801 --> 01:16:22.360
Sh!

628
01:17:03.721 --> 01:17:06.190
- You got a cigarette?
- No.


629
01:17:06.401 --> 01:17:08.199
Oh, all right.

630
01:19:08.521 --> 01:19:12.480
Dear Joan, I'm sorry
I haven't called or written.


631
01:19:14.641 --> 01:19:18.236
My dear Joan... 
My dear... children.

632
01:19:18.441 --> 01:19:21.559
Dear family...
I am back in my grandmother's house.


633
01:19:21.761 --> 01:19:24.753
I took my last walk
with my mother from here.


634
01:19:24.961 --> 01:19:26.998
Out the door and up the hill.

635
01:19:27.201 --> 01:19:31.115
She held my hand and made me
promise I'd never come back.


636
01:19:31.321 --> 01:19:37.351
We'd planned our escape here,
and I've only just realised something.


637
01:19:37.561 --> 01:19:40.235
Escape routes exist
when you're a child.


638
01:19:40.441 --> 01:19:43.354
All kinds of escape routes are possible.

639
01:19:43.561 --> 01:19:49.716
Then, when you grow up, they vanish,
and you have to live without them.


640
01:19:49.921 --> 01:19:53.630
Anyway, lkiss your eyes
and those of my darling children.


641
01:19:53.841 --> 01:19:56.310
Your husband sends these words.

642
01:20:53.241 --> 01:20:56.233
I'm looking
for Eleni Gatzoyiannis.


643
01:21:04.761 --> 01:21:06.081
Well?

644
01:21:06.281 --> 01:21:09.956
All the relatives of the escaped
have been locked up.


645
01:21:10.161 --> 01:21:12.721
Except for Eleni Gatzoyiannis.

646
01:21:12.921 --> 01:21:15.356
- The Americana?
- Yes, sir.


647
01:21:15.561 --> 01:21:18.280
This soldier allowed them to escape?

648
01:21:18.481 --> 01:21:22.714
Their escape route went past his post.
He stood on one of our mines.


649
01:21:22.921 --> 01:21:25.993
Lock him up.
Don't give medicine to traitors.


650
01:21:26.201 --> 01:21:27.760
Traitors?

651
01:21:27.961 --> 01:21:30.635
He was wounded while in pursuit.

652
01:21:30.841 --> 01:21:32.991
Peasants and children!

653
01:21:33.201 --> 01:21:36.398
Our army can be outwitted
by peasants and children?


654
01:21:36.601 --> 01:21:42.119
If so, the word of this escape
will inspire others in this territory.


655
01:21:43.161 --> 01:21:48.315
He was a collaborator. He was bribed
by the Americana and her dollars.


656
01:21:48.521 --> 01:21:51.673
He was wounded while trying to escape.

657
01:21:51.881 --> 01:21:55.556
Please, get me a signed confession
to that effect.


658
01:22:54.161 --> 01:22:56.835
We're going to have a trial, Americana.

659
01:22:59.241 --> 01:23:03.712
And at that trial,
in front of all the people,


660
01:23:03.921 --> 01:23:06.800
you're going to confess your crimes.

661
01:23:07.001 --> 01:23:10.039
What crimes? What have I done?

662
01:23:11.361 --> 01:23:13.750
You collaborated with the enemy.

663
01:23:13.961 --> 01:23:16.601
You transmitted vital military information.

664
01:23:16.801 --> 01:23:18.394
No!

665
01:23:18.601 --> 01:23:22.834
All I did was to help my children escape.
That's all.


666
01:23:23.041 --> 01:23:24.714
ESCape?

667
01:23:24.921 --> 01:23:27.913
This is a liberated village.

668
01:23:28.121 --> 01:23:31.113
What were they escaping from?

669
01:23:31.321 --> 01:23:34.279
Your village is loyal to our cause.

670
01:23:34.481 --> 01:23:39.271
I have sent reports to my superiors
stating that loyalty.


671
01:23:39.481 --> 01:23:43.440
How am I going to explain this escape
to my superiors?


672
01:23:43.641 --> 01:23:46.713
- Hm?
- I don't know.


673
01:24:13.561 --> 01:24:15.996
- Citizens of Lia!
- Sh!


674
01:24:19.681 --> 01:24:22.673
For some time now,

675
01:24:22.881 --> 01:24:28.593
there's been a fascist organisation
in existence in your own village.


676
01:24:30.121 --> 01:24:32.431
I am happy to inform you

677
01:24:32.641 --> 01:24:37.715
that thanks to the vigilance
of our guerrilla intelligence,


678
01:24:37.921 --> 01:24:41.630
this organisation has been uncovered.

679
01:24:41.841 --> 01:24:45.277
The criminals before you

680
01:24:45.481 --> 01:24:49.236
have endangered all our lives

681
01:24:49.441 --> 01:24:53.912
by passing on vital military information
to the enemy


682
01:24:54.121 --> 01:24:57.512
with the 20 traitors
who fled from Lia.


683
01:24:57.721 --> 01:25:01.237
All of you must abhor their treachery.

684
01:25:02.161 --> 01:25:03.993
There they are.

685
01:25:04.201 --> 01:25:06.317
Andreas Mikopoulos.

686
01:25:06.521 --> 01:25:09.513
Spiridon Mikopoulos.

687
01:25:09.721 --> 01:25:12.315
Vasili Nikou.

688
01:25:12.521 --> 01:25:14.592
Alexo Gatzoyiannis.

689
01:25:16.281 --> 01:25:18.158
Elias Gratos.

690
01:25:20.881 --> 01:25:23.236
Eleni Gatzoyiannis.

691
01:25:40.841 --> 01:25:42.354
The Americana!

692
01:25:44.641 --> 01:25:48.111
She was never one of you.

693
01:25:48.321 --> 01:25:51.712
How many of you
had packages from America?


694
01:25:52.881 --> 01:25:56.112
While you starved, she feasted.

695
01:25:57.041 --> 01:26:00.397
While you worked, she plotted.

696
01:26:03.841 --> 01:26:06.037
Americana,

697
01:26:06.241 --> 01:26:09.791
you are charged
with organising the escape


698
01:26:10.001 --> 01:26:13.790
and trying to bribe the citizens of Lia
with your American money.


699
01:26:14.001 --> 01:26:16.151
That's not true.

700
01:26:16.361 --> 01:26:20.116
I have done nothing wrong.

701
01:26:32.481 --> 01:26:35.234
I have done no harm.

702
01:26:36.281 --> 01:26:40.161
And I have wished no harm to anyone.

703
01:26:40.361 --> 01:26:45.117
All I wanted was for my children
to be safe with their father.


704
01:26:45.321 --> 01:26:48.473
By refusing to send her children
to socialist countries,


705
01:26:48.681 --> 01:26:52.436
she betrayed the goals of our revolution.

706
01:26:52.641 --> 01:26:56.236
By sending them to fascists,
she betrayed us all.


707
01:27:04.761 --> 01:27:07.992
Who will speak in her defence?

708
01:27:18.481 --> 01:27:23.032
It is against the law to withhold
information of guilt or innocence.


709
01:27:23.241 --> 01:27:29.510
So I ask, if any of you have proof
of the Americana's innocence or guilt,


710
01:27:30.881 --> 01:27:33.521
step forward now and speak.

711
01:27:38.841 --> 01:27:41.720
We have a witness. 
Comrade Katroubis.

712
01:27:46.441 --> 01:27:48.955
Yes, I have something to say.

713
01:27:49.161 --> 01:27:52.552
She, Eleni Gatzoyiannis...

714
01:27:55.881 --> 01:27:59.920
...the Americana, she tried to bribe me
with her American dollars


715
01:28:00.121 --> 01:28:03.557
to turn against you
and join the fascist cause.


716
01:28:03.761 --> 01:28:08.039
- Ana...
- You did, you tried to bribe me.


717
01:28:08.241 --> 01:28:10.755
But I wouldn't do it.

718
01:28:11.601 --> 01:28:13.478
I wouldn't do it.

719
01:28:19.841 --> 01:28:24.074
Katis, the children are leaving.

720
01:28:28.721 --> 01:28:30.871
Citizens of Lia,

721
01:28:32.121 --> 01:28:36.194
our children are about to leave
for Albania and Czechoslovakia.


722
01:28:37.601 --> 01:28:41.390
We will take a short pause
in the proceedings of this trial,


723
01:28:41.601 --> 01:28:44.673
in order to permit their parents
to say goodbye.


724
01:29:18.241 --> 01:29:20.039
Citizens of Lia,

725
01:29:21.401 --> 01:29:25.998
the People's Court, having found
the accused guilty of treason,


726
01:29:26.201 --> 01:29:29.239
is now ready to pass sentence.

727
01:29:31.681 --> 01:29:34.673
Andreas Mikopoulos,

728
01:29:34.881 --> 01:29:37.873
death by firing squad.

729
01:29:38.081 --> 01:29:40.470
Vasili Nikou,

730
01:29:40.681 --> 01:29:43.594
death by firing squad.

731
01:29:44.681 --> 01:29:47.400
Eleni Gatzoyiannis,

732
01:29:47.601 --> 01:29:49.478
death by firing squad.

733
01:30:02.441 --> 01:30:04.398
Spiro, when do we die?

734
01:30:04.601 --> 01:30:07.070
Tomorrow morning.

735
01:30:07.281 --> 01:30:10.797
Do you know where my daughter is?

736
01:30:11.761 --> 01:30:14.275
Can I see her?

737
01:30:14.481 --> 01:30:15.835
One last time?

738
01:30:18.841 --> 01:30:20.991
You, move!

739
01:30:24.761 --> 01:30:26.877
Please, Spiro.

740
01:31:02.841 --> 01:31:04.275
Open up.

741
01:31:15.361 --> 01:31:18.160
- Glykeria!
- Mana.


742
01:31:23.321 --> 01:31:25.232
Aah...

743
01:31:28.321 --> 01:31:30.676
Sh...!

744
01:31:31.921 --> 01:31:34.117
Sh! Don't cry.

745
01:31:35.401 --> 01:31:37.551
Don't cry.

746
01:31:42.041 --> 01:31:44.794
Oh, look, they've cut your hair.

747
01:31:45.761 --> 01:31:48.480
Never mind, it will grow back.

748
01:31:48.681 --> 01:31:51.958
It's been hard for you, I know.

749
01:31:53.041 --> 01:31:55.794
- But you must be strong.
- Mana!


750
01:31:57.401 --> 01:31:59.153
No.

751
01:32:01.241 --> 01:32:03.278
Listen,

752
01:32:03.481 --> 01:32:05.677
you must live.

753
01:32:05.881 --> 01:32:08.077
You must live.

754
01:32:08.281 --> 01:32:12.912
You have something wonderful
to look forward to.


755
01:32:14.281 --> 01:32:16.636
Some day,

756
01:32:16.841 --> 01:32:21.392
you will marry
and have children of your own.


757
01:32:23.921 --> 01:32:26.674
It is such a joy...

758
01:32:28.241 --> 01:32:30.835
...to be a mother.

759
01:32:31.041 --> 01:32:34.079
It is such a joy.

760
01:32:37.561 --> 01:32:41.270
And I thank God
for letting me know it.

761
01:32:50.081 --> 01:32:52.118
Go now.

762
01:32:54.881 --> 01:32:58.033
Don't wait for them to separate us.

763
01:32:58.241 --> 01:33:00.710
Goodbye, my child.

764
01:33:02.001 --> 01:33:05.710
May you live for me
as long as the mountains.


765
01:33:08.241 --> 01:33:10.471
Go... now.

766
01:35:49.241 --> 01:35:50.675
Load!

767
01:35:56.121 --> 01:35:57.953
Aim!

768
01:36:01.201 --> 01:36:02.475
My children!

769
01:36:02.681 --> 01:36:04.035
Fire!

770
01:36:05.561 --> 01:36:07.837
My children!

771
01:36:12.841 --> 01:36:16.675
- Those were her last words?
- "My children."


772
01:36:16.881 --> 01:36:20.511
I was hidden over there. I saw her.

773
01:36:27.681 --> 01:36:29.035
Mana...

774
01:36:51.481 --> 01:36:54.200
The judge, what was his name?

775
01:36:55.161 --> 01:36:56.993
Stavros Petrakis.

776
01:36:58.241 --> 01:37:01.916
He called himself Katis at the time.

777
01:37:02.841 --> 01:37:08.120
The officials at the bureau told
me that he had died a few years ago.


778
01:37:09.001 --> 01:37:11.720
They don't know anything.

779
01:37:11.921 --> 01:37:14.197
He's back in Greece!

780
01:37:14.401 --> 01:37:17.951
We're too ashamed to return,
but he's not?


781
01:37:20.001 --> 01:37:22.515
Where in Greece is he?

782
01:37:24.561 --> 01:37:26.757
Where in Greece is he?

783
01:37:28.801 --> 01:37:30.758
In the town.

784
01:37:30.961 --> 01:37:32.918
Saloniki.

785
01:37:49.041 --> 01:37:52.432
Yes? Can I help you?

786
01:37:52.641 --> 01:37:55.599
I think I have the wrong address.

787
01:37:55.801 --> 01:37:58.475
I am looking for Stavros Petrakis.

788
01:37:58.681 --> 01:38:01.434
I'm his wife.
ls it about the pension?


789
01:38:01.641 --> 01:38:04.201
No. My name is Nick Gage,
"New York Times".


790
01:38:04.401 --> 01:38:06.915
I have an appointment
with your husband.


791
01:38:07.121 --> 01:38:09.874
Appointment? He didn't say anything...

792
01:38:12.001 --> 01:38:17.792
Come in. You shouldn't open
the door by yourself! I told you before!


793
01:38:23.961 --> 01:38:27.192
- There's a man from New York.
- What?


794
01:38:27.401 --> 01:38:32.350
A man from New York. He says
he has an appointment with you.


795
01:38:45.881 --> 01:38:50.557
My wife says that
we've got an appointment of some kind.


796
01:38:50.761 --> 01:38:54.595
My name is Nick Gage,
"New York Times".


797
01:38:54.801 --> 01:38:57.031
"New York Times"?

798
01:39:00.441 --> 01:39:04.196
You didn't say "New York Times",
you just said New York!


799
01:39:04.401 --> 01:39:09.919
I'm doing an article about the evolution
of the Greek judicial system.


800
01:39:10.121 --> 01:39:14.354
The Minister of Justice in Athens
suggested I speak with you.


801
01:39:14.561 --> 01:39:16.791
Wait a minute!

802
01:39:18.801 --> 01:39:21.190
Now I remember.

803
01:39:21.401 --> 01:39:24.712
I saw you on the television.

804
01:39:25.681 --> 01:39:30.278
Well, apparently there's been
a little breakdown in communications.


805
01:39:30.481 --> 01:39:34.236
The Minister was supposed
to telephone you about this interview.


806
01:39:34.441 --> 01:39:39.038
Sorry to bother you. I can come back
at a more convenient time.


807
01:39:39.241 --> 01:39:41.391
Oh, please...

808
01:39:41.601 --> 01:39:46.232
Oh... all I have these days
is convenience.


809
01:39:48.201 --> 01:39:52.672
No, no, it's perfect. 
Please... sit down.

810
01:39:54.361 --> 01:39:58.150
Go and get our guest something to eat.

811
01:39:59.801 --> 01:40:02.475
Yeah, "New York Times".

812
01:40:07.321 --> 01:40:08.641
Oh, look...

813
01:40:08.841 --> 01:40:10.957
Let me just go and...

814
01:40:11.161 --> 01:40:13.550
I was taking a little nap.

815
01:40:15.321 --> 01:40:18.040
Had I known...

816
01:40:18.241 --> 01:40:22.599
I'll be right back. Sit. Sit!

817
01:41:34.681 --> 01:41:36.319
So...

818
01:41:37.761 --> 01:41:40.116
I'm all yours.

819
01:41:40.321 --> 01:41:43.154
I've ordered that
we should not be disturbed.


820
01:41:43.361 --> 01:41:46.001
I really appreciate your cooperation.

821
01:41:46.201 --> 01:41:51.401
On the contrary, I'm very grateful to you.
You've made me very happy.


822
01:41:51.601 --> 01:41:57.074
My wife and my daughter are sick
of my stories of the Civil War.


823
01:41:57.281 --> 01:42:03.277
And you come all this way,
The "New York Times" yet.


824
01:42:03.481 --> 01:42:09.318
They're in there now, plotting
how to deal with me when you leave.


825
01:42:09.521 --> 01:42:11.194
Please.

826
01:42:11.401 --> 01:42:13.551
Shall we start?

827
01:42:15.041 --> 01:42:16.873
Testing, one, two, three.

828
01:42:17.081 --> 01:42:19.550
Testing, one, two, three.

829
01:42:19.761 --> 01:42:21.957
Stavros Petrakis.

830
01:42:24.521 --> 01:42:27.195
Testing, one, tvvo, three.

831
01:42:29.201 --> 01:42:31.795
Which side were you on
in the Civil War?


832
01:42:32.001 --> 01:42:35.631
On the side of Greece, of course.

833
01:42:36.481 --> 01:42:40.634
It wasn't so much a war,
you understand, as a...


834
01:42:40.841 --> 01:42:44.550
No, it was a battle of ideas.

835
01:42:44.761 --> 01:42:49.471
To me, Greeks have always
clung to the notion


836
01:42:49.681 --> 01:42:54.755
that man's life is ruled by ideas.

837
01:42:56.401 --> 01:42:58.790
And the period in question...

838
01:43:00.361 --> 01:43:02.716
...it was an exhilarating time.

839
01:43:06.081 --> 01:43:08.595
Wonderful bread.

840
01:43:08.801 --> 01:43:10.758
Home-made.

841
01:43:10.961 --> 01:43:13.999
You must try it.

842
01:43:14.201 --> 01:43:17.717
- No, I'm not hungry.
- Please, you must.


843
01:43:17.921 --> 01:43:21.118
It's fresh.
The wheat comes from my village.


844
01:43:21.321 --> 01:43:25.872
You can't buy bread like this,
especially not in America.


845
01:43:26.081 --> 01:43:27.958
Please, Nick.

846
01:43:28.161 --> 01:43:32.439
No, no. You were born in Greece,
I shall call you Nikola.


847
01:43:32.641 --> 01:43:35.679
- If you don't mind?
- No, I don't mind.


848
01:43:35.881 --> 01:43:39.920
And your parents are in America?

849
01:43:41.201 --> 01:43:44.000
My father is, yes.

850
01:43:44.201 --> 01:43:48.718
- And your mother?
- My mother remained in Greece.


851
01:43:48.921 --> 01:43:54.678
Although I've heard some
wonderful things about America,


852
01:43:54.881 --> 01:43:57.634
some of our people chose to stay...

853
01:43:57.841 --> 01:44:00.196
My mother didn't actually choose to stay.

854
01:44:00.401 --> 01:44:03.280
She had some legal problems
during the Civil War.


855
01:44:03.481 --> 01:44:08.317
There was a trial, there were witnesses,
there was a judge.


856
01:44:09.841 --> 01:44:13.835
- What side was she on?
- She was on the civilian side.


857
01:44:14.041 --> 01:44:17.796
Were you ever involved
in trials of civilians?


858
01:44:18.001 --> 01:44:23.758
No, that's impossible.
There are no civilians in a civil war.


859
01:44:23.961 --> 01:44:30.116
If you're looking for your mother,
maybe I could be of some assistance.


860
01:44:30.321 --> 01:44:32.358
You see, I've got some friends...

861
01:44:32.561 --> 01:44:35.519
My mother was executed.
Death by firing squad.


862
01:44:35.721 --> 01:44:40.113
Her name was Eleni Gatzoyiannis.
Some called her Americana.


863
01:44:40.321 --> 01:44:42.551
Do you remember her?

864
01:44:44.521 --> 01:44:48.355
Remember her? I don't understand.

865
01:44:48.561 --> 01:44:52.919
About 800 kilometres away from here,
there's a village called Lia.


866
01:44:53.121 --> 01:44:56.352
Do you remember that village?

867
01:44:59.001 --> 01:45:00.560
- Lia?
- Lia.


868
01:45:05.761 --> 01:45:07.035
No.

869
01:45:07.241 --> 01:45:08.914
No, I...

870
01:45:09.121 --> 01:45:13.558
I don't think that I have ever been
to a village by that name.


871
01:45:13.761 --> 01:45:17.994
Some names change,
but this village is still called Lia.


872
01:45:18.201 --> 01:45:22.240
You, I believe,
were called Katis at that time.


873
01:45:25.601 --> 01:45:27.080
Katis?

874
01:45:28.201 --> 01:45:29.475
No.

875
01:45:29.681 --> 01:45:31.797
No, I was never...

876
01:45:56.841 --> 01:46:00.436
I think maybe you made a big mistake.

877
01:46:01.521 --> 01:46:03.797
Why are you still alive?

878
01:46:05.841 --> 01:46:09.550
How can you live,
knowing what you've done?


879
01:46:12.881 --> 01:46:18.274
I think you'd better leave.
I don't know what you're talking about.


880
01:46:18.481 --> 01:46:21.439
I'm talking about
Eleni Gatzoyiannis, my mother.


881
01:46:21.641 --> 01:46:24.838
I'm not interested in your mother!

882
01:46:27.361 --> 01:46:29.477
Sit down.

883
01:46:31.121 --> 01:46:33.032
Sit down.

884
01:46:34.321 --> 01:46:38.360
You don't deserve to die standing up.
Sit down!


885
01:46:54.601 --> 01:46:57.241
My children!

886
01:47:44.721 --> 01:47:47.156
Don't be afraid.

887
01:48:08.401 --> 01:48:11.792
My dear family,
I'm sending you this tape.


888
01:48:12.001 --> 01:48:14.561
I'll be coming home soon.

889
01:48:16.041 --> 01:48:19.397
The hunt for my mother's killer is over.

890
01:48:20.401 --> 01:48:25.350
I did not inherit the necessary hate
to end a human life.


891
01:48:26.481 --> 01:48:32.921
I am still mystified by the love
my mother felt for me and my sisters.


892
01:48:33.121 --> 01:48:37.399
The question of being worth it or not
is no longer applicable.


893
01:48:37.601 --> 01:48:41.276
I accept it as something she gave me.

894
01:48:41.481 --> 01:48:44.951
I accept her love as my inheritance.

895
01:48:46.401 --> 01:48:49.712
Imiss you and I love you.

896
01:48:49.921 --> 01:48:52.959
I miss and love my children.

897
01:48:54.721 --> 01:48:56.917
Ihope with all my heart

898
01:48:57.121 --> 01:49:00.512
the love I've discovered
is not for mothers alone.


899
01:49:00.721 --> 01:49:02.917
I want to feel it, too.

900
01:49:03.121 --> 01:49:05.874
Ihave a need to feel it.

901
01:49:06.081 --> 01:49:11.918
To share the inheritance my mother
left me with you and my children.


902
01:49:12.121 --> 01:49:14.954
I know that
they are not just my children.


903
01:49:15.161 --> 01:49:17.880
I know that they are ours.

904
01:49:18.081 --> 01:49:21.119
I may be late
in returning home to claim them,


905
01:49:21.321 --> 01:49:26.077
but I hope you can understand
my need to say those words.


906
01:49:28.121 --> 01:49:30.317
My children.
