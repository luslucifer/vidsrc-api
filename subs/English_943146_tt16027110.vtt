00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:20.286
- Mom, I promised my friends

2
00:01:20.286 --> 00:01:21.536
I'm going already, okay?
- I don't care!


3
00:01:21.536 --> 00:01:22.544
You're not going out.
- No!


4
00:01:22.544 --> 00:01:24.023
- You are grounded.
- No, I'm going.


5
00:01:24.023 --> 00:01:24.996
- Tylar!
- You can't stop me.


6
00:01:24.996 --> 00:01:26.986
- Stop!

7
00:01:26.986 --> 00:01:28.718
-  Get away from me!

8
00:01:28.718 --> 00:01:30.105
- Tylar!

9
00:01:30.105 --> 00:01:33.636
You are still grounded and
you are going to stay grounded


10
00:01:33.636 --> 00:01:37.109
until you find a way to fix
the things you've broken!


11
00:01:39.566 --> 00:01:43.329
- I said, I'm going out.

12
00:01:50.071 --> 00:01:51.488
-Tylar!

13
00:01:56.734 --> 00:02:00.569
- Ow, ow, ow! Mom, you're hurting me.

14
00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:06.206
What do you think, Mom? 
Should I call CPS?

15
00:02:06.206 --> 00:02:07.656
Seems like child abuse to me.

16
00:02:11.485 --> 00:02:12.318
- Tylar.

17
00:02:12.318 --> 00:02:14.340
- Stay out of it, Val.

18
00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:15.173
- Tylar.

19
00:02:15.173 --> 00:02:17.076
- We have to do something.

20
00:02:17.076 --> 00:02:18.326
-Get back here.

21
00:02:19.369 --> 00:02:20.202
- Val, Val.
- Stop.


22
00:02:20.202 --> 00:02:21.616
You are not going out.

23
00:02:21.616 --> 00:02:23.176
- Hey. Hey!
- Honey, please.


24
00:02:23.176 --> 00:02:24.009
Honey, come on.

25
00:02:24.009 --> 00:02:24.842
- No.

26
00:02:24.842 --> 00:02:25.796
- Hey, what the fuck, man?

27
00:02:25.796 --> 00:02:26.873
- She's being a bitch.

28
00:02:26.873 --> 00:02:27.986
Drive. Drive!
- Get out of the car.


29
00:02:27.986 --> 00:02:30.076
- Go. Go.
- Get out of...


30
00:02:30.076 --> 00:02:31.659
-  Fuck you!

31
00:02:39.454 --> 00:02:40.287
- Yes!

32
00:02:40.287 --> 00:02:41.833
- Like, so good.

33
00:02:41.833 --> 00:02:42.686
- Yo!
- Hey.


34
00:02:42.686 --> 00:02:44.812
- Yo! What up?

35
00:02:44.812 --> 00:02:46.312
- What's up?
- Hi.


36
00:02:47.807 --> 00:02:50.036
- So you escaped from Auschwitz, huh, Ty?

37
00:02:50.036 --> 00:02:52.606
- No prison walls can hold this, babe.

38
00:02:52.606 --> 00:02:54.566
Yes, please, please, please, please.

39
00:02:54.566 --> 00:02:56.256
- Graham, do you
think you could give me

40
00:02:56.256 --> 00:02:57.436
a ride to campus manana?

41
00:02:57.436 --> 00:02:59.066
My block cracked.

42
00:02:59.066 --> 00:03:00.116
- You got that right?

43
00:03:01.311 --> 00:03:02.954
- Totally. Hit me, bro.

44
00:03:02.954 --> 00:03:04.537
- That looks good.

45
00:03:10.543 --> 00:03:12.743
- You're loitering
unless you buy somethin'.


46
00:03:18.196 --> 00:03:20.496
-  I was just about to order.

47
00:03:20.496 --> 00:03:22.409
- Your parents know you're out this late?

48
00:03:26.996 --> 00:03:29.119
I'm gonna need to see some ID.

49
00:03:35.286 --> 00:03:37.969
- Geez, guys, he's just
bustin' your balls.


50
00:03:39.786 --> 00:03:42.156
This is my lover from another mother.

51
00:03:42.156 --> 00:03:43.649
Boston, Ty.

52
00:03:46.716 --> 00:03:48.209
- Hey, gimme your hand.

53
00:03:52.206 --> 00:03:55.419
- So, Ty. Like tie me up?

54
00:03:57.206 --> 00:03:58.603
- You wish. Tylar.

55
00:04:05.836 --> 00:04:08.962
Where'd you get Boston from?

56
00:04:08.962 --> 00:04:09.795
You from there?

57
00:04:13.436 --> 00:04:15.869
- No. It's personal.

58
00:04:20.476 --> 00:04:22.449
Maybe I'll tell you
if I know you better.

59
00:04:32.636 --> 00:04:33.579
- Don't answer it.

60
00:04:36.346 --> 00:04:37.912
- Ooh! What's up?

61
00:04:37.912 --> 00:04:39.736
-Hi, is Tylar there, please?

62
00:04:39.736 --> 00:04:42.016
- No, this is Squishy's bro.

63
00:04:42.016 --> 00:04:42.849
-Her bro?

64
00:04:42.849 --> 00:04:43.736
- Squishy can't come
to the phone right now


65
00:04:43.736 --> 00:04:47.622
'cause she's in the shower
with her best friend Tylar.


66
00:04:47.622 --> 00:04:48.455
-What do you
mean she's in the shower?


67
00:04:48.455 --> 00:04:50.319
Put Tylar on the phone right now.

68
00:04:50.319 --> 00:04:51.402
Who is this?

69
00:04:51.402 --> 00:04:52.235
Excuse me.
- No, no.


70
00:04:52.235 --> 00:04:53.068
And actually, you know what?

71
00:04:53.068 --> 00:04:56.514
I gotta go 'cause they want
me in there with them, so.


72
00:04:56.514 --> 00:04:58.315
-Put Tylar
on the phone right now!


73
00:04:58.315 --> 00:05:00.096
- I'm sorry, bye.

74
00:05:00.096 --> 00:05:02.369
- That's harsh, man. 
She's worried.

75
00:05:03.976 --> 00:05:06.349
- So we're having a threesome?

76
00:05:08.549 --> 00:05:11.079
You and me and your sister?

77
00:05:15.096 --> 00:05:16.924
- Yeah, I didn't think that part through.

78
00:05:18.409 --> 00:05:19.242
- No shit.

79
00:05:19.242 --> 00:05:20.616
- Can we get outta here?

80
00:05:20.616 --> 00:05:23.016
I have the need for some weed.

81
00:05:23.016 --> 00:05:24.786
- My crib. My dad's outta town.

82
00:05:24.786 --> 00:05:25.733
- As per uzh.

83
00:05:27.145 --> 00:05:28.680
- Let's go, then.

84
00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:30.636
Yeah, go. What are we waiting for?

85
00:05:30.636 --> 00:05:32.496
-  Come on! Let's go.

86
00:05:32.496 --> 00:05:34.646
- Ty, your phone.

87
00:05:34.646 --> 00:05:37.889
- Hurry up.

88
00:05:43.726 --> 00:05:44.875
- Maybe she's in the shower.

89
00:05:44.875 --> 00:05:46.376
- No.

90
00:05:46.376 --> 00:05:48.497
Squishy doesn't have a brother.

91
00:05:48.497 --> 00:05:49.806
Tylar's messing with me.

92
00:05:49.806 --> 00:05:53.919
I don't even know Squishy's
real name, or where she lives.


93
00:05:55.326 --> 00:05:57.133
- What do you wanna do?

94
00:06:04.826 --> 00:06:07.776
- So how long
is your dad outta town?

95
00:06:07.776 --> 00:06:11.009
- Trick question. 
When is he ever in town?

96
00:06:13.276 --> 00:06:15.216
- At least you got a dad.

97
00:06:15.216 --> 00:06:17.116
My mom won't even
tell me who mine is.

98
00:06:18.406 --> 00:06:20.506
- Well, in the
absence of a father figure,

99
00:06:21.496 --> 00:06:24.589
it's incumbent upon
you to invent your own.


100
00:06:25.807 --> 00:06:27.249
- Incumbent?

101
00:06:28.106 --> 00:06:30.501
- Community college smart guy talk.

102
00:06:31.954 --> 00:06:33.506
- Okay, okay, okay.

103
00:06:33.506 --> 00:06:37.796
Well, my dad is

104
00:06:41.976 --> 00:06:46.976
the El Chapo of the
biggest, baddest cartel


105
00:06:46.976 --> 00:06:48.769
in North America.

106
00:06:49.726 --> 00:06:51.521
He has bodies everywhere.

107
00:06:51.521 --> 00:06:52.913
- What?

108
00:06:52.913 --> 00:06:54.540
- Everywhere.

109
00:06:54.540 --> 00:06:59.540
And he took on the DEA
and the FBI and the CIA


110
00:07:02.116 --> 00:07:04.659
and the ATF.
- The KGB.


111
00:07:05.712 --> 00:07:06.869
- And the KGB,

112
00:07:08.052 --> 00:07:13.052
and a bunch of other letters,
and he won and they lost.


113
00:07:15.636 --> 00:07:17.413
But then he met my mom,

114
00:07:17.413 --> 00:07:19.906
and he knocked her up, and he realized

115
00:07:19.906 --> 00:07:23.429
she was the bitch-meister
from hell, so he bailed.


116
00:07:25.016 --> 00:07:26.919
- 'Cause she's a DEA agent.

117
00:07:27.856 --> 00:07:28.779
- County engineer.

118
00:07:30.016 --> 00:07:31.909
But we can go with that.

119
00:07:33.636 --> 00:07:34.469
- Ease up.

120
00:07:34.469 --> 00:07:37.446
Your mom'll get pissed if
you show up super stoned.


121
00:07:37.446 --> 00:07:38.888
- Okay, Grandpa Graham.

122
00:07:41.774 --> 00:07:44.206
Why don't we just stay here
and keep the party going?


123
00:07:44.206 --> 00:07:45.123
- For real.

124
00:07:48.316 --> 00:07:50.255
- You're staying, right?

125
00:07:50.255 --> 00:07:51.088
- Mm-hmm.

126
00:08:06.149 --> 00:08:07.749
-Just watch your step.

127
00:08:12.486 --> 00:08:13.656
- I know you don't wanna hear this,

128
00:08:13.656 --> 00:08:15.349
but it's tough love time.

129
00:08:17.356 --> 00:08:19.026
- She'll show up. 
She always does.

130
00:08:19.026 --> 00:08:20.586
- And what then?

131
00:08:20.586 --> 00:08:23.599
What happens when things
escalate like they already are?


132
00:08:25.856 --> 00:08:28.766
- I don't even know what
happened, it just...


133
00:08:31.949 --> 00:08:33.043
Am I a terrible mother?

134
00:08:33.043 --> 00:08:34.679
- You're a great mom.

135
00:08:36.736 --> 00:08:38.986
I just think it's time
you laid down the law.


136
00:08:40.026 --> 00:08:42.436
If I were you, 
I would change the locks.

137
00:08:42.436 --> 00:08:43.326
Take back control.

138
00:08:43.326 --> 00:08:45.926
- She'll run away again!

139
00:08:45.926 --> 00:08:47.686
- What is the alternative?

140
00:08:47.686 --> 00:08:50.239
That one of you ends up
in the hospital or worse?


141
00:08:51.438 --> 00:08:55.832
Thank you for helping.

142
00:08:55.832 --> 00:08:58.156
You should go. I don't
want Devon to be mad at me.


143
00:08:58.156 --> 00:08:58.989
- Tough love.

144
00:10:29.555 --> 00:10:30.816
- Tylar?

145
00:10:30.816 --> 00:10:31.866
- She's not home yet?

146
00:10:34.256 --> 00:10:37.309
- Hey, I'll buzz you in. Door's open.

147
00:10:56.917 --> 00:10:58.069
- Hey, girl.

148
00:10:58.069 --> 00:10:58.902
- Hey.

149
00:10:59.836 --> 00:11:01.886
- Want some coffee?
- Thank you.


150
00:11:01.886 --> 00:11:02.719
- Yep.

151
00:11:06.981 --> 00:11:07.814
Here ya go.

152
00:11:07.814 --> 00:11:09.316
- You haven't slept?

153
00:11:09.316 --> 00:11:12.506
- No, no. She stayed out all night.

154
00:11:12.506 --> 00:11:13.956
She's never done that before.

155
00:11:25.796 --> 00:11:27.046
- I'm really sorry, Mom.

156
00:11:28.920 --> 00:11:33.157
I'm so sorry.

157
00:11:33.157 --> 00:11:35.490
- Oh, okay, okay. It's okay.

158
00:11:36.917 --> 00:11:38.989
It's okay. All right?

159
00:11:43.896 --> 00:11:45.029
- Sorry. Hi, Val.

160
00:11:47.505 --> 00:11:48.338
- Hi.

161
00:11:49.303 --> 00:11:52.292
- You gotta wash this
glitter off your face.


162
00:11:52.292 --> 00:11:53.125
- I know.

163
00:11:55.466 --> 00:11:59.476
I should probably get ready
for school.


164
00:12:11.456 --> 00:12:12.289
- What?

165
00:12:14.726 --> 00:12:15.866
- That's an act.

166
00:12:15.866 --> 00:12:17.806
But as a credit card fraud investigator,

167
00:12:17.806 --> 00:12:20.769
I read people and their
motives and she is playing you.


168
00:12:22.236 --> 00:12:23.069
- Maybe.

169
00:12:25.139 --> 00:12:28.139
- Oh honey.

170
00:12:31.420 --> 00:12:33.236
You know her passcode?

171
00:12:33.236 --> 00:12:34.069
- Why?

172
00:12:36.096 --> 00:12:36.929
Why?

173
00:12:36.929 --> 00:12:37.946
- Because we're gonna
download a tracking app


174
00:12:37.946 --> 00:12:39.506
and the next time she
pulls a stent like this,


175
00:12:39.506 --> 00:12:40.966
we're gonna drag her ass back here-

176
00:12:40.966 --> 00:12:41.996
- Stop it.

177
00:12:41.996 --> 00:12:44.319
Absolutely not. Put it back.

178
00:12:45.166 --> 00:12:49.119
Please, put it back. Val.

179
00:12:49.976 --> 00:12:53.329
If she found out about
that, it would be over.


180
00:12:54.896 --> 00:12:56.949
Please, put it back.

181
00:12:58.616 --> 00:12:59.449
- Okay.

182
00:13:00.986 --> 00:13:03.926
But when you're ready, and you will be,

183
00:13:03.926 --> 00:13:05.176
I'll download it for you.

184
00:13:08.496 --> 00:13:09.329
-Deal.

185
00:13:40.136 --> 00:13:40.969
- Hey.

186
00:13:45.586 --> 00:13:46.539
- Sorry.
- Yeah.


187
00:13:56.346 --> 00:13:58.939
- Got a really big pile of blow.

188
00:14:05.186 --> 00:14:08.246
- Hi, Mom. This is Boston.

189
00:14:08.246 --> 00:14:09.726
He's gonna tutor me in algebra.

190
00:14:09.726 --> 00:14:11.086
- Good to meet you, Mrs. Witt.

191
00:14:11.086 --> 00:14:12.079
- Ms. Witt.

192
00:14:13.766 --> 00:14:14.599
Tylar, can you come and help me

193
00:14:14.599 --> 00:14:15.716
with the groceries, please?

194
00:14:15.716 --> 00:14:16.636
- I can help you.

195
00:14:16.636 --> 00:14:18.396
- No, let me tutor you.

196
00:14:18.396 --> 00:14:20.846
That's mom code for she
wants to talk in private.


197
00:14:22.456 --> 00:14:23.659
Kill the music, Boston.

198
00:14:31.186 --> 00:14:32.019
- Okay.

199
00:14:33.596 --> 00:14:35.836
Who's this Boston and
where did you meet him?


200
00:14:35.836 --> 00:14:37.126
- Seriously, Mom?

201
00:14:37.126 --> 00:14:39.486
You're always on my ass about my grades.

202
00:14:39.486 --> 00:14:41.096
How come the minute I
actually find someone


203
00:14:41.096 --> 00:14:43.416
to help me bring them up,
you gotta crap all over it?


204
00:14:43.416 --> 00:14:46.633
- Okay, I'm just asking
where you met, Tylar.


205
00:14:48.552 --> 00:14:51.556
He's obviously four or five
years older than you, right?


206
00:14:51.556 --> 00:14:52.409
In his 20s?

207
00:14:54.190 --> 00:14:56.186
Is there something going
on between the two of you?


208
00:14:56.186 --> 00:14:57.379
- God, Mom, no.

209
00:14:59.106 --> 00:15:01.006
Boston's just a friend.

210
00:15:01.006 --> 00:15:03.316
He goes to Folsom and he
wants to be a math teacher.


211
00:15:03.316 --> 00:15:05.989
- Sorry, Folsom Community College?

212
00:15:07.476 --> 00:15:09.239
- He offered to help. That's it.

213
00:15:11.156 --> 00:15:13.473
Besides, I'm pretty sure he's gay, so.

214
00:15:15.106 --> 00:15:16.049
- As a daffodil.

215
00:15:17.816 --> 00:15:20.476
But I get if it's weird.

216
00:15:20.476 --> 00:15:22.726
I can totally bounce if
you want me to leave.


217
00:15:26.340 --> 00:15:28.146
- No, it's okay. You can stay.

218
00:15:28.146 --> 00:15:30.046
- Only if I can help.

219
00:15:30.046 --> 00:15:31.346
I like cooking for people.

220
00:15:32.296 --> 00:15:33.486
- Okay, sure.

221
00:15:33.486 --> 00:15:35.279
- Okay, cool. I'm gonna wash up.

222
00:15:37.236 --> 00:15:38.319
- It's that way.

223
00:15:43.656 --> 00:15:46.036
Okay, let me understand this here.

224
00:15:46.036 --> 00:15:48.976
This guy shows up out of nowhere

225
00:15:48.976 --> 00:15:52.649
and apparently wants to tutor
you in math for no reason.


226
00:15:54.426 --> 00:15:58.896
Ty, this is a little too
good to be true, honey.


227
00:15:58.896 --> 00:15:59.869
I'm not stupid.

228
00:16:01.376 --> 00:16:03.249
- I swear, he's just a cool guy.

229
00:16:04.506 --> 00:16:07.006
His dad's never really
home, so I think he's just,


230
00:16:07.006 --> 00:16:08.929
I don't know, lonely or something.

231
00:16:11.035 --> 00:16:13.456
Hey, seriously?

232
00:16:13.456 --> 00:16:15.216
You were gonna change the locks?

233
00:16:15.216 --> 00:16:16.049
You were gonna lock me out?

234
00:16:16.049 --> 00:16:18.229
- No, Tylar.
- No, mine.


235
00:16:20.096 --> 00:16:20.929
Don't.

236
00:16:23.103 --> 00:16:25.253
- Tylar, things have
to change around here.


237
00:16:27.736 --> 00:16:31.299
- I know. And they will, I promise.

238
00:16:32.656 --> 00:16:34.109
- I make a mean rigatoni.

239
00:16:39.849 --> 00:16:41.599
Just gonna grab that.

240
00:17:41.736 --> 00:17:43.146
- You know, he offered to help renovate

241
00:17:43.146 --> 00:17:45.459
the rooms upstairs so
I can rent them out?

242
00:17:48.236 --> 00:17:50.356
- And he's offering out of
the goodness of his heart?


243
00:17:50.356 --> 00:17:53.826
- Well yeah. I offered
to pay, but he refused.


244
00:17:53.826 --> 00:17:56.456
I think he's just really
desperate for company.


245
00:17:56.456 --> 00:17:57.939
I feel really bad for him.

246
00:17:59.035 --> 00:18:01.086
- I thought you said he
was in a relationship.


247
00:18:01.086 --> 00:18:03.306
- He is, but you know, it's rocky.

248
00:18:03.306 --> 00:18:05.206
It's off and on.

249
00:18:05.206 --> 00:18:07.276
- Hmm, so that's
why he likes it here

250
00:18:07.276 --> 00:18:11.057
because he has yours and
Tylar's shoulders to cry on.


251
00:18:11.057 --> 00:18:14.976
- Val, he doesn't have
a good home life, okay?


252
00:18:14.976 --> 00:18:16.886
His dad's never around.
He travels all the time.


253
00:18:16.886 --> 00:18:18.359
- Well, what about his mom?

254
00:18:19.216 --> 00:18:20.566
- He's never mentioned her.

255
00:18:22.296 --> 00:18:25.826
Look, all I know is that
her grades in math are up.


256
00:18:25.826 --> 00:18:27.209
All of her grades are up.

257
00:18:28.206 --> 00:18:30.346
She's different when he's around.

258
00:18:30.346 --> 00:18:33.596
She smiles. We haven't fought.

259
00:18:33.596 --> 00:18:35.716
He's a good influence.

260
00:18:35.716 --> 00:18:38.209
He calls her his little
sister. It's adorable.


261
00:18:41.766 --> 00:18:43.246
- Look, I gotta go.

262
00:18:43.246 --> 00:18:45.666
I've got brunch with Devon's family.

263
00:18:45.666 --> 00:18:46.499
- Oh.

264
00:18:46.499 --> 00:18:47.332
- Shoot me now.

265
00:18:47.332 --> 00:18:48.456
- Oh yeah.

266
00:18:48.456 --> 00:18:49.926
- I'll see myself out.

267
00:18:49.926 --> 00:18:50.759
- Okay.

268
00:18:59.796 --> 00:19:03.366
Whoa. You were right.

269
00:19:03.366 --> 00:19:05.317
I love this color. It's perfect.

270
00:19:05.317 --> 00:19:06.150
- Yeah?
- Yeah.


271
00:19:06.150 --> 00:19:07.556
- It's lively, but it's neutral enough

272
00:19:07.556 --> 00:19:08.766
for whoever wants to rent the room.

273
00:19:08.766 --> 00:19:10.159
- Lively and neutral.

274
00:19:11.696 --> 00:19:13.356
I like that.

275
00:19:13.356 --> 00:19:15.376
Well, I just wanted to tell
you that I really appreciate


276
00:19:15.376 --> 00:19:19.456
all your help around here,
not just in the room.


277
00:19:19.456 --> 00:19:20.289
- It's cool.

278
00:19:20.289 --> 00:19:21.509
I liked hanging with you and Ty.

279
00:19:21.509 --> 00:19:24.186
- What do you mean "liked"?

280
00:19:24.186 --> 00:19:25.596
I hope you don't
think I'm just using you

281
00:19:25.596 --> 00:19:27.536
to fix the room up.

282
00:19:27.536 --> 00:19:31.946
I really, we really
like having you around.


283
00:19:31.946 --> 00:19:32.779
Yeah.

284
00:19:32.779 --> 00:19:34.589
- No, that's awesome, and thank you.

285
00:19:35.956 --> 00:19:39.326
The thing is, my dad sold the house,

286
00:19:39.326 --> 00:19:40.706
so I'm moving outta state.

287
00:19:40.706 --> 00:19:42.336
- Really?

288
00:19:42.336 --> 00:19:43.998
Wow, I'm sorry to hear that.

289
00:19:43.998 --> 00:19:45.586
- Yeah, it sucks.

290
00:19:45.586 --> 00:19:47.696
I mean, I'm used to switching schools

291
00:19:47.696 --> 00:19:48.529
in the middle of the term,

292
00:19:48.529 --> 00:19:51.926
but I feel like I finally
made good friends here.


293
00:19:51.926 --> 00:19:55.199
- What about your boyfriend. God, is it?

294
00:19:58.036 --> 00:19:58.869
Well, you're in college now.

295
00:19:58.869 --> 00:20:00.996
I mean, you can
get your own place, right?

296
00:20:00.996 --> 00:20:02.116
- I'm not a baller, J.

297
00:20:02.116 --> 00:20:04.956
I mean, even if I could get
more hours at La Cantina


298
00:20:04.956 --> 00:20:06.979
there's no way I could
afford rent around here.


299
00:20:09.456 --> 00:20:10.289
- Yeah.

300
00:20:23.216 --> 00:20:25.426
Hey, how about this?

301
00:20:25.426 --> 00:20:27.576
I gotta rent this room to someone.

302
00:20:27.576 --> 00:20:28.626
- Yeah, but I can't afford it.

303
00:20:28.626 --> 00:20:31.536
- I know, but you know
what you can't afford


304
00:20:31.536 --> 00:20:34.466
to pay me in rent you can
make up as a handyman.


305
00:20:34.466 --> 00:20:35.736
You're really helpful, Boston,

306
00:20:35.736 --> 00:20:38.646
and the room next door
needs to be renovated.


307
00:20:38.646 --> 00:20:39.556
- You serious?

308
00:20:41.186 --> 00:20:42.019
- I don't know.

309
00:20:42.906 --> 00:20:44.936
I mean, I don't
want it to be weird.

310
00:20:44.936 --> 00:20:45.769
-What do you mean?

311
00:20:45.769 --> 00:20:48.742
- Like, what if
I wanna have God over?

312
00:20:48.742 --> 00:20:51.646
And how would Ty feel about
having me around 24-7?


313
00:20:52.896 --> 00:20:55.146
- I think she would love
to have you next door


314
00:20:55.146 --> 00:20:56.796
as opposed to across the country.

315
00:20:59.056 --> 00:21:00.756
- Mind if I think about it?

316
00:21:00.756 --> 00:21:03.213
- Okay. Yeah.

317
00:21:03.213 --> 00:21:04.056
- Awesome.

318
00:21:04.056 --> 00:21:04.889
- Awesome.

319
00:21:05.926 --> 00:21:09.156
- I'm a complete mess.
I'm gonna go wash up.


320
00:21:09.156 --> 00:21:10.449
- Okay. Yeah.

321
00:21:28.926 --> 00:21:30.736
- She full-on begged me to move in.

322
00:21:30.736 --> 00:21:33.326
- Oh my God. It totally worked.

323
00:21:44.756 --> 00:21:46.673
- Wait, but she's right down the hall.

324
00:21:46.673 --> 00:21:47.526
- So?

325
00:21:47.526 --> 00:21:49.419
- It's too risky.
- No, come on.


326
00:21:50.886 --> 00:21:51.786
Don't you want to?

327
00:22:44.519 --> 00:22:46.067
- I gotta work.

328
00:22:46.067 --> 00:22:47.400
- What? Come on.

329
00:22:50.373 --> 00:22:52.319
Stay and party.

330
00:22:52.319 --> 00:22:54.879
- I can't. I gotta make
scratch for my lady.


331
00:22:57.203 --> 00:22:58.036
- Fine.

332
00:22:59.803 --> 00:23:02.696
But, I don't know, since
this is the last night


333
00:23:02.696 --> 00:23:04.876
at your old crib, shouldn't we give it

334
00:23:04.876 --> 00:23:08.309
a proper sendoff, you
know, in honor of your dad.


335
00:23:15.253 --> 00:23:17.126
- A fire extinguisher?

336
00:23:17.126 --> 00:23:19.215
- Look out.

337
00:23:19.215 --> 00:23:20.210
- Okay, okay.

338
00:23:23.704 --> 00:23:28.287
- What are you doing?

339
00:23:30.299 --> 00:23:31.132
-  Who's next?

340
00:23:31.132 --> 00:23:33.549
- Well, okay then.

341
00:23:35.462 --> 00:23:37.281
- Yeah, babe. Oh!

342
00:24:01.736 --> 00:24:03.746
- Whoa, whoa, Ty. What are you?

343
00:24:03.746 --> 00:24:05.580
Ty, Ty, stop, stop.

344
00:24:05.580 --> 00:24:07.325
Stop, stop, stop.

345
00:24:32.216 --> 00:24:33.466
- Is there anything special

346
00:24:33.466 --> 00:24:35.116
we can make for your friends, Ty?

347
00:24:36.596 --> 00:24:37.896
- Well, it's Memorial Day.

348
00:24:37.896 --> 00:24:40.781
So, hot dogs and chips?

349
00:24:40.781 --> 00:24:41.955
- Okay.

350
00:24:41.955 --> 00:24:44.086
- Unless you wanna make it a kegger.

351
00:24:44.086 --> 00:24:45.376
- Ha ha.

352
00:24:45.376 --> 00:24:46.609
- Yeah, didn't think so.

353
00:24:52.906 --> 00:24:57.111
- What about you, Boston,
you wanna bring anybody? God?


354
00:24:57.111 --> 00:24:59.849
- You know, I wasn't going
to, but if you'd be down.


355
00:25:00.896 --> 00:25:02.896
- Yeah, of course. 
The more the merrier.

356
00:25:06.746 --> 00:25:09.746
Sweetheart, you're leaving an
awful lot of silk on those.


357
00:25:09.746 --> 00:25:11.996
You just have to, yeah, I can...

358
00:25:13.756 --> 00:25:14.706
-  Whatever.

359
00:25:18.166 --> 00:25:19.736
- She's a good kid.

360
00:25:19.736 --> 00:25:21.736
Just like teenage hormones or somethin'.

361
00:25:27.096 --> 00:25:29.276
- What happened to her hand?

362
00:25:29.276 --> 00:25:31.326
- She said she
broke a glass doing dishes.

363
00:25:31.326 --> 00:25:33.526
- Yeah, that's what she told me, too.

364
00:25:33.526 --> 00:25:36.056
And I would believe that if I
could buy Tylar doing dishes,


365
00:25:36.056 --> 00:25:36.889
which I don't.

366
00:25:45.559 --> 00:25:46.559
Is she okay?

367
00:25:50.186 --> 00:25:52.236
Would you tell me if something was wrong?

368
00:25:55.266 --> 00:25:57.806
- Yeah. Yeah, I would.

369
00:25:57.806 --> 00:26:00.516
But I mostly just
work and go to school.

370
00:26:00.516 --> 00:26:02.236
I don't really have time to hang,

371
00:26:02.236 --> 00:26:03.736
except of course to tutor her.

372
00:26:08.746 --> 00:26:09.579
Let me help.

373
00:26:13.236 --> 00:26:14.069
I got it.

374
00:26:16.366 --> 00:26:21.309
Oh, smells good. Really good.

375
00:26:24.354 --> 00:26:26.506
I take it you've done this before.

376
00:26:26.506 --> 00:26:27.339
- Yeah.

377
00:27:00.753 --> 00:27:02.957
- Ty, what the hell are you doin'?

378
00:27:02.957 --> 00:27:04.387
- Um, you.

379
00:27:04.387 --> 00:27:06.896
- No, this is way risky.

380
00:27:06.896 --> 00:27:09.489
If your mom sees us in
here, she'll throw me out.


381
00:27:12.466 --> 00:27:13.379
- Got any X?

382
00:27:15.826 --> 00:27:17.476
Come on, where's your bag of fun?

383
00:28:03.406 --> 00:28:05.539
Have you ever been in love before?

384
00:28:08.155 --> 00:28:10.033
- No.

385
00:28:10.033 --> 00:28:12.419
-  Think this
is what it feels like?


386
00:28:16.084 --> 00:28:16.917
- Yeah.

387
00:28:20.631 --> 00:28:21.714
I think I do.

388
00:28:24.326 --> 00:28:25.433
I love you.

389
00:28:25.433 --> 00:28:27.419
-  I want
it to be like this.

390
00:28:29.176 --> 00:28:31.889
I want us to be like this forever.

391
00:28:41.916 --> 00:28:43.366
- Who's stopping us?

392
00:28:44.226 --> 00:28:45.726
-  Have you met my mom?

393
00:28:47.226 --> 00:28:49.486
- She's not that bad.

394
00:28:49.486 --> 00:28:53.916
I mean, maybe if we just tell her.

395
00:28:53.916 --> 00:28:55.719
- She wouldn't understand.

396
00:29:00.956 --> 00:29:02.506
- Has it always been like this?

397
00:29:07.122 --> 00:29:10.030
- We've had some good times.

398
00:29:10.030 --> 00:29:13.409
My 10th birthday.

399
00:29:14.466 --> 00:29:18.066
She surprised me, took me out to dinner

400
00:29:18.066 --> 00:29:22.263
to this castle restaurant
way up on a hill.


401
00:29:23.512 --> 00:29:25.095
- That's beautiful.

402
00:29:26.196 --> 00:29:28.349
- It was. Totally.

403
00:29:33.846 --> 00:29:36.216
I felt like a princess.

404
00:29:36.216 --> 00:29:38.619
I just couldn't believe
she did all that for me.


405
00:29:42.174 --> 00:29:43.374
But it was just one day.

406
00:29:47.886 --> 00:29:52.446
- Some day, I'm gonna buy
you a castle on a hill


407
00:29:54.496 --> 00:29:56.996
and I'm gonna treat you
like a princess every day.


408
00:29:58.626 --> 00:29:59.459
- I love you.

409
00:30:04.235 --> 00:30:06.819
- I love you.

410
00:30:26.175 --> 00:30:29.080
Come on, do it now.

411
00:30:31.226 --> 00:30:33.456
- So that's God? 
Boston's boyfriend?

412
00:30:33.456 --> 00:30:34.916
-Yeah, I guess
they're back together.


413
00:30:34.916 --> 00:30:36.496
- And allegedly this is the first time

414
00:30:36.496 --> 00:30:38.966
that Boston's meeting Tylar's friends.

415
00:30:38.966 --> 00:30:41.577
- Allegedly? What, are we on trial here?

416
00:30:41.577 --> 00:30:44.356
Oh, the
courtroom of Val Paladino


417
00:30:44.356 --> 00:30:46.263
is always in session, trust me.

418
00:30:47.240 --> 00:30:51.165
- I'm sorry, I just, I
don't trust that kid.


419
00:30:51.165 --> 00:30:53.016
There's somethin' about him.

420
00:30:55.976 --> 00:30:58.086
I just hope you didn't
pull the trigger too fast.


421
00:30:58.086 --> 00:31:00.286
You know, moving the
fox into the hen house.


422
00:31:02.406 --> 00:31:05.776
Come on, guys,
today's Memorial Day.


423
00:31:05.776 --> 00:31:07.714
Why don't we toast to my Uncle Beau

424
00:31:07.714 --> 00:31:09.758
and to the others
who fought for us, huh?

425
00:31:09.758 --> 00:31:10.591
Come on.

426
00:31:12.814 --> 00:31:14.086
- All right, ready?

427
00:31:14.086 --> 00:31:15.540
- No hard feelings.

428
00:31:24.734 --> 00:31:28.236
- So this thing with Boston,
it's like an actual thing?


429
00:31:28.236 --> 00:31:31.199
I mean, he's like old and gay.

430
00:31:32.096 --> 00:31:35.089
- He's bi and I thought
you were my friend.


431
00:31:36.056 --> 00:31:37.900
- I am it's just...

432
00:31:59.726 --> 00:32:03.906
But, I know you
don't mean to, it's just,

433
00:32:03.906 --> 00:32:05.799
I think you're messing
with his head a little bit.


434
00:32:06.676 --> 00:32:09.939
So what, you think I should
be with someone my own age?


435
00:32:10.866 --> 00:32:11.706
Got someone in mind?

436
00:32:11.706 --> 00:32:13.429
- No, come on, Ty. Not cool.

437
00:32:30.306 --> 00:32:31.406
- What's up with that?

438
00:32:33.086 --> 00:32:34.606
- I didn't wanna say anything,

439
00:32:34.606 --> 00:32:37.459
but he got a
little handsy in the pool.

440
00:32:53.296 --> 00:32:55.926
No, it's okay. 
I told him what's what.

441
00:33:35.405 --> 00:33:36.946
What are you doing?

442
00:33:36.946 --> 00:33:38.246
- Just using the restroom.

443
00:33:40.856 --> 00:33:41.689
- Right.

444
00:33:42.646 --> 00:33:43.626
- Took someone's credit card

445
00:33:43.626 --> 00:33:47.079
and bought $5,000 worth
of luggage in Paris.


446
00:33:47.952 --> 00:33:50.386
Ah, so this is the new project.

447
00:33:50.386 --> 00:33:51.606
- Yeah.

448
00:33:51.606 --> 00:33:54.336
We're gonna add some doors, paint,

449
00:33:54.336 --> 00:33:56.906
and Boston thinks it'll
be ready in about a month.


450
00:33:56.906 --> 00:33:58.034
- That's exciting.

451
00:33:58.034 --> 00:33:59.117
- I think so.

452
00:34:09.689 --> 00:34:12.688
Tylar's always leaving
her bags everywhere.


453
00:34:16.406 --> 00:34:18.536
-  Okay, but do
we really have to study?


454
00:34:18.536 --> 00:34:21.446
- No, but then you'll
fail your test tomorrow.


455
00:34:21.446 --> 00:34:24.752
I've invested way too much
into you to let that happen.


456
00:34:24.752 --> 00:34:25.919
- Oh, whatevs.

457
00:34:33.646 --> 00:34:34.846
Mom, what is all this stuff?

458
00:34:34.846 --> 00:34:36.336
- You tell me.

459
00:34:36.336 --> 00:34:38.181
- That's not mine!

460
00:34:38.181 --> 00:34:39.014
- Tylar.

461
00:34:40.876 --> 00:34:41.709
Tylar.

462
00:34:41.709 --> 00:34:44.309
Get back here now!

463
00:34:47.246 --> 00:34:48.079
- Hmm?

464
00:34:51.966 --> 00:34:54.736
Anything else you wanna accuse me of, Mom?

465
00:34:54.736 --> 00:34:56.016
- It's mine.

466
00:34:56.016 --> 00:34:56.849
-What?

467
00:34:56.849 --> 00:34:58.776
- I mean, it's God's, but
I let him keep it here.


468
00:34:58.776 --> 00:35:00.506
I would never hurt you or Ty.

469
00:35:00.506 --> 00:35:02.366
- I want you
to get outta my house.

470
00:35:02.366 --> 00:35:04.416
- No. No, Mom, you can't do that.

471
00:35:04.416 --> 00:35:05.423
- Yes I can and I will.

472
00:35:05.423 --> 00:35:07.646
- No, if you throw him
out, then I'm leaving, too.


473
00:35:07.646 --> 00:35:08.479
- It's okay, Ty.

474
00:35:08.479 --> 00:35:09.586
- What, do you
want me to call CPS?

475
00:35:09.586 --> 00:35:11.286
Huh? Is that what you really want?

476
00:35:12.656 --> 00:35:13.799
- Just go, please.

477
00:35:17.576 --> 00:35:18.409
Sweetheart.

478
00:35:21.566 --> 00:35:23.886
You swear to me those drugs aren't yours?

479
00:35:23.886 --> 00:35:26.499
- Why don't you ever just believe me!

480
00:35:27.666 --> 00:35:29.436
- Stay away from his room!

481
00:35:30.269 --> 00:35:32.889
- What? Joanne, you
can't let him stay here.


482
00:35:36.106 --> 00:35:37.289
- I'll lose her again.

483
00:35:39.096 --> 00:35:40.346
- What do you mean again?

484
00:35:54.889 --> 00:35:56.943
- When Tylar was a kid, uh,

485
00:35:59.206 --> 00:36:01.639
it was a really stressful time for me.

486
00:36:02.806 --> 00:36:05.329
I was working full-time,

487
00:36:06.506 --> 00:36:11.059
not making enough money
and raising her by myself.


488
00:36:14.899 --> 00:36:17.223
Tylar was a difficult child.

489
00:36:26.346 --> 00:36:30.379
One day I was driving her to
daycare and she was screaming,


490
00:36:31.356 --> 00:36:34.636
just mouthing off, out of control,

491
00:36:34.636 --> 00:36:37.049
just screaming and screaming.

492
00:36:38.826 --> 00:36:40.736
She wouldn't stop.

493
00:36:40.736 --> 00:36:45.616
And I just snapped.

494
00:36:45.616 --> 00:36:50.616
I turned around and I just,
I hit her really hard.


495
00:36:56.742 --> 00:36:58.342
I left my handprint on her face.

496
00:37:05.616 --> 00:37:09.739
And her teacher saw it and called CPS.

497
00:37:12.822 --> 00:37:15.439
And they took her away for six months.

498
00:37:22.309 --> 00:37:23.669
I thought I was going to die.

499
00:37:27.872 --> 00:37:29.439
And when I got her back,

500
00:37:29.439 --> 00:37:31.796
they told me if they ever
suspected abuse again


501
00:37:31.796 --> 00:37:32.786
I would lose her.

502
00:37:32.786 --> 00:37:35.269
- So that's why you're
afraid to discipline her now.


503
00:37:39.195 --> 00:37:40.695
- I'm so ashamed.

504
00:37:41.596 --> 00:37:43.596
Oh God, I'm so ashamed.

505
00:37:47.586 --> 00:37:48.609
It's my fault.

506
00:37:51.982 --> 00:37:53.149
It's my fault.

507
00:38:02.693 --> 00:38:04.616
- No, Tylar. Seriously.

508
00:38:04.616 --> 00:38:06.616
-  I missed you.

509
00:38:06.616 --> 00:38:09.429
- No, stop. Get out.

510
00:38:10.286 --> 00:38:11.862
Get out.

511
00:38:11.862 --> 00:38:16.862
- Mm-mm.

512
00:38:18.076 --> 00:38:19.049
- Ty, stop.

513
00:38:19.986 --> 00:38:21.309
- I thought you loved me.

514
00:38:22.506 --> 00:38:26.623
- You know I do, but your mom
seriously hates me right now.


515
00:38:26.623 --> 00:38:28.906
- Oh my God, you actually
care what she thinks?


516
00:38:28.906 --> 00:38:30.456
- I care about staying with you

517
00:38:30.456 --> 00:38:32.906
and that's not gonna happen
if she throws me out.


518
00:38:33.976 --> 00:38:36.559
Stop! What's wrong with you?

519
00:38:38.326 --> 00:38:39.606
- You sound like her.

520
00:38:39.606 --> 00:38:41.456
- You know that's
not how I meant it.

521
00:38:44.100 --> 00:38:45.450
- I just wanna be with you.

522
00:38:47.286 --> 00:38:50.306
Can't you call in sick to work tomorrow?

523
00:38:50.306 --> 00:38:51.296
I'll skip school.

524
00:38:51.296 --> 00:38:54.116
- No, Ty. You're not gonna do that.

525
00:38:54.116 --> 00:38:55.869
Okay, and I gotta make scratch.

526
00:38:57.186 --> 00:38:58.386
- Well, I'm not leaving.

527
00:39:00.086 --> 00:39:01.816
- Mom.
- Ty.


528
00:39:01.816 --> 00:39:04.879
Okay, okay. Okay, chill.

529
00:39:06.296 --> 00:39:07.129
Okay.

530
00:39:10.576 --> 00:39:12.016
- Tell me you love me.

531
00:39:12.016 --> 00:39:13.133
- You know I do.

532
00:39:14.723 --> 00:39:15.753
Now get out.

533
00:39:44.236 --> 00:39:45.316
- Right.

534
00:39:45.316 --> 00:39:47.776
Well, I'm recommending that
we close the Bridges case.


535
00:39:47.776 --> 00:39:49.876
It looks like a legitimate account hack.

536
00:39:49.876 --> 00:39:51.926
I still have some
legwork to do on Fehte.

537
00:39:52.776 --> 00:39:54.939
Okay, I'll talk to you soon. Bye.

538
00:39:56.676 --> 00:39:59.859
- Okay, Mrs. Kravitz,
stick to credit card fraud.


539
00:40:01.376 --> 00:40:03.096
- It's a school
day and Joanne's at work

540
00:40:03.096 --> 00:40:04.846
and they're having pizza delivered.

541
00:40:06.056 --> 00:40:08.286
You tell me what's going on.

542
00:40:08.286 --> 00:40:09.906
- Let's see.

543
00:40:09.906 --> 00:40:13.556
Boston's working on the
renovations and he got hungry.


544
00:40:13.556 --> 00:40:16.883
Ooh, another case solved. God, I'm good.

545
00:40:58.513 --> 00:40:59.606
- Boston!

546
00:41:17.359 --> 00:41:18.317
Boston?

547
00:41:32.843 --> 00:41:35.731
- Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

548
00:41:35.731 --> 00:41:36.564
Whoa!

549
00:41:36.564 --> 00:41:37.397
- Oh my God.

550
00:41:37.397 --> 00:41:38.230
- What the hell?

551
00:41:38.230 --> 00:41:39.106
- I am so sorry, Boston.

552
00:41:39.106 --> 00:41:40.316
I heard the music.

553
00:41:40.316 --> 00:41:41.766
- We broke up, I swear.

554
00:41:41.766 --> 00:41:42.599
- Sorry.
- But you're not gonna


555
00:41:42.599 --> 00:41:43.786
tell J, are you?

556
00:41:43.786 --> 00:41:44.619
Hey, wait!

557
00:41:45.926 --> 00:41:47.646
I said wait.

558
00:41:47.646 --> 00:41:49.556
You're not gonna tell J
about God and me, right?


559
00:41:49.556 --> 00:41:50.389
- I have to.

560
00:41:51.426 --> 00:41:53.506
- Maybe I'll get to her first.

561
00:41:53.506 --> 00:41:54.593
Tell her how you busted in here,

562
00:41:54.593 --> 00:41:57.146
came into my room to see me naked.

563
00:41:57.146 --> 00:41:59.861
- Come on, she
knows me better than that.

564
00:42:02.436 --> 00:42:03.783
- It ain't a lie, right?

565
00:42:06.453 --> 00:42:09.376
Maybe I didn't know what else to do,

566
00:42:09.376 --> 00:42:12.306
so I let you
take advantage of me, huh?

567
00:42:13.726 --> 00:42:18.319
Oh wait, plot twist, 
I'm gay, right?

568
00:42:20.066 --> 00:42:21.519
Oh, just too bad.

569
00:42:22.986 --> 00:42:25.939
'Cause I've always wanted
to fuck an older bitch.


570
00:42:26.956 --> 00:42:28.456
You feel me?

571
00:42:28.456 --> 00:42:29.719
Feel me? That's right.

572
00:42:30.707 --> 00:42:31.790
That's right.

573
00:42:33.096 --> 00:42:33.969
That's what's up.

574
00:42:54.486 --> 00:42:56.526
Thanks for the solid, bro.

575
00:42:56.526 --> 00:42:58.257
- I'm not your bro.

576
00:42:58.257 --> 00:43:01.016
I'm the guy that you
used to hook up with.

577
00:43:01.016 --> 00:43:04.089
- I know. Things change.

578
00:43:05.456 --> 00:43:07.689
And I still got
ya, so be chill, okay?

579
00:43:08.626 --> 00:43:09.786
- Chill?

580
00:43:09.786 --> 00:43:12.436
Okay, don't ask me to do this again.

581
00:43:12.436 --> 00:43:14.886
I don't wanna be a part
of whatever game this is.


582
00:43:15.849 --> 00:43:17.979
- It's not a game. It's love.

583
00:43:19.116 --> 00:43:20.999
- Okay. Whatever.

584
00:43:23.196 --> 00:43:24.029
Peace out.

585
00:43:28.097 --> 00:43:29.109
- That was way uncool.

586
00:43:29.109 --> 00:43:29.942
- Right?

587
00:43:37.996 --> 00:43:40.846
We should just take off somewhere.

588
00:43:40.846 --> 00:43:43.036
Go somewhere no one could find us

589
00:43:43.036 --> 00:43:45.925
and we could be together all the time.

590
00:43:45.925 --> 00:43:46.909
- How would we live?

591
00:43:47.836 --> 00:43:52.156
- We could go to L.
A. and be porn stars.

592
00:43:52.156 --> 00:43:54.666
- You're underage. 
I think they'd notice.

593
00:43:54.666 --> 00:43:58.244
- Okay, well, you could do it then.

594
00:43:58.244 --> 00:44:00.444
And I wouldn't care.
It's just a job, right?


595
00:44:01.846 --> 00:44:03.486
You could do gay stuff.

596
00:44:03.486 --> 00:44:04.649
It pays better.

597
00:44:05.551 --> 00:44:08.419
- I would never cheat on
you, not even for money.


598
00:44:11.389 --> 00:44:14.169
- Oh my God, I was just playing.

599
00:44:16.406 --> 00:44:18.046
Your ass is mine.

600
00:44:18.046 --> 00:44:19.889
Do you think I'd
ever let you sell it?

601
00:44:22.236 --> 00:44:23.486
- I love you, Tylar Witt,

602
00:44:24.836 --> 00:44:27.496
and I'll do whatever I have
to to keep us together.


603
00:44:33.636 --> 00:44:37.053
♪ Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh ♪

604
00:44:54.856 --> 00:44:55.906
- How was your shift?

605
00:44:58.976 --> 00:45:00.176
- What are you doin' up?

606
00:45:01.946 --> 00:45:02.796
- Couldn't sleep.

607
00:45:08.016 --> 00:45:08.929
- Everything okay?

608
00:45:16.142 --> 00:45:18.046
- I don't understand what you're saying.

609
00:45:18.046 --> 00:45:19.449
- He's not gay, Joanne.

610
00:45:20.626 --> 00:45:23.599
Or he's, what are they calling
it now? Sexually fluid.


611
00:45:25.786 --> 00:45:27.199
- Why are you saying this?

612
00:45:28.056 --> 00:45:29.106
- Think about it, Joanne.

613
00:45:29.106 --> 00:45:30.996
A guy shows up out of
nowhere and wants to spend


614
00:45:30.996 --> 00:45:33.426
all of his time with
your underage daughter.


615
00:45:33.426 --> 00:45:36.406
And then the next thing
you know he's moving in?


616
00:45:36.406 --> 00:45:37.816
- That was my idea.

617
00:45:37.816 --> 00:45:38.649
- Was it?

618
00:45:39.986 --> 00:45:42.806
Because now you have drugs and
condoms all over your house


619
00:45:42.806 --> 00:45:46.066
and he has an easy excuse
to explain them away.


620
00:45:46.066 --> 00:45:48.016
Oh, I'm just holding them for a friend?

621
00:45:49.306 --> 00:45:51.986
You don't think that as
the wife of a cop

622
00:45:51.986 --> 00:45:53.386
I haven't heard that before?

623
00:46:05.175 --> 00:46:06.008
- What?

624
00:46:10.980 --> 00:46:12.386
Oak Ridge High School.

625
00:46:12.386 --> 00:46:13.486
- Hi, I just got an alert

626
00:46:13.486 --> 00:46:15.493
that my daughter's been
absent from school today?


627
00:46:15.493 --> 00:46:16.976
Name, please.

628
00:46:16.976 --> 00:46:19.596
- Sorry, Tylar Witt.

629
00:46:19.596 --> 00:46:21.286
Yes. All week.

630
00:46:21.286 --> 00:46:22.249
- All week?

631
00:46:23.096 --> 00:46:24.823
Why is this the first
time I'm hearing of this?


632
00:46:24.823 --> 00:46:27.273
We've
sent multiple notices.


633
00:46:28.646 --> 00:46:31.029
- Okay. Thank you.

634
00:46:40.780 --> 00:46:41.613
Tylar?

635
00:46:44.919 --> 00:46:46.228
Tylar!

636
00:46:49.765 --> 00:46:52.235
-  I'm not here.
Leave a message, or don't.


637
00:46:52.235 --> 00:46:53.068
- Tylar!

638
00:46:59.926 --> 00:47:01.576
Boston, open the door. Now!

639
00:47:03.181 --> 00:47:04.479
What's up, J?

640
00:47:05.644 --> 00:47:07.556
-Tylar!

641
00:47:07.556 --> 00:47:09.576
- Why would Tylar be in here?

642
00:47:09.576 --> 00:47:11.169
She'd be at school, right?

643
00:47:13.266 --> 00:47:16.276
- You have two fucking seconds
to tell me where she is.


644
00:47:16.276 --> 00:47:17.661
- I swear I don't know.

645
00:47:28.376 --> 00:47:29.536
- You son of a bitch!

646
00:47:29.536 --> 00:47:30.662
She's just a kid!

647
00:47:30.662 --> 00:47:31.986
- It's not like that, J!

648
00:47:31.986 --> 00:47:33.156
Ty's not a kid anymore.

649
00:47:33.156 --> 00:47:34.786
We love each other!

650
00:47:34.786 --> 00:47:35.916
- You what?

651
00:47:35.916 --> 00:47:36.749
You fucking what?

652
00:47:36.749 --> 00:47:38.840
You love her?
- Mom, no, stop!


653
00:47:38.840 --> 00:47:40.368
- You fucking love her?
- Stop! Stop!


654
00:47:40.368 --> 00:47:42.063
You crazy bitch, stop it!
- Get the fuck outta here!


655
00:47:42.063 --> 00:47:44.122
- No, Boston, don't, don't.

656
00:47:44.122 --> 00:47:45.213
- Let go of me.

657
00:47:45.213 --> 00:47:46.567
- Tylar!
- Let go! Let go!


658
00:47:48.025 --> 00:47:48.985
- Go in the house!

659
00:47:49.968 --> 00:47:50.801
Don't!

660
00:47:50.801 --> 00:47:52.329
- Do it, do it. Hit me!

661
00:47:52.329 --> 00:47:53.966
Hit me. Hit me, Mom.

662
00:47:53.966 --> 00:47:55.719
- Go back inside, now!

663
00:47:57.826 --> 00:47:59.201
Go!

664
00:48:01.246 --> 00:48:03.266
- They fuckin' played me. Oh God.

665
00:48:03.266 --> 00:48:04.099
- Joanne!

666
00:48:06.789 --> 00:48:09.123
Please.

667
00:48:09.123 --> 00:48:10.185
- You on the phone?

668
00:48:10.185 --> 00:48:11.346
Give me the phone.
- Mom, no!


669
00:48:11.346 --> 00:48:13.806
No, please. He doesn't
have anywhere to go.


670
00:48:13.806 --> 00:48:14.639
Where is he gonna go?

671
00:48:14.639 --> 00:48:17.706
- He's going to prison, Tylar. To prison.

672
00:48:17.706 --> 00:48:18.539
-  No.

673
00:48:18.539 --> 00:48:20.666
- Listen to me. This is
what's gonna happen now.


674
00:48:20.666 --> 00:48:21.957
This is mine.

675
00:48:21.957 --> 00:48:22.790
- No!

676
00:48:22.790 --> 00:48:23.826
- I will take you to school,

677
00:48:23.826 --> 00:48:25.316
I will pick you up from school.

678
00:48:25.316 --> 00:48:27.826
You will come here and
you will go nowhere else


679
00:48:27.826 --> 00:48:30.409
until I decide you are ready to leave.

680
00:48:31.376 --> 00:48:33.025
Keep crying, Tylar.

681
00:48:33.025 --> 00:48:34.429
- No.
- I don't give a shit.


682
00:48:38.885 --> 00:48:40.635
-  I hate you!

683
00:48:42.209 --> 00:48:43.966
- I want that tracking app.

684
00:48:43.966 --> 00:48:45.766
I wanna monitor her calls, her texts,

685
00:48:45.766 --> 00:48:47.199
social media, everything.

686
00:48:50.446 --> 00:48:51.816
I wanna press charges.

687
00:48:51.816 --> 00:48:53.736
This is statutory rape, right?

688
00:48:53.736 --> 00:48:54.569
- Yes.

689
00:48:54.569 --> 00:48:56.888
And you should file charges,

690
00:48:56.888 --> 00:48:59.236
but it's gonna be difficult to prove

691
00:48:59.236 --> 00:49:02.316
unless you could somehow
get Tylar to testify.


692
00:49:02.316 --> 00:49:04.629
- I'll get proof. Trust me.

693
00:49:10.326 --> 00:49:11.159
Thanks.

694
00:49:28.576 --> 00:49:30.026
-  Hey, Squishy. Ready?

695
00:49:30.026 --> 00:49:31.776
- I was born ready, babe.

696
00:49:43.326 --> 00:49:45.426
- I had to borrow
money for a new uniform.

697
00:49:47.026 --> 00:49:48.976
- Where'd you sleep last night?

698
00:49:48.976 --> 00:49:52.436
- My car 'cause none of our
friends would let me crash.


699
00:49:52.436 --> 00:49:54.036
- Yeah, that's 'cause they suck.

700
00:49:59.176 --> 00:50:00.096
- You don't think your mom's actually

701
00:50:00.096 --> 00:50:01.496
gonna press charges, do you?

702
00:50:04.436 --> 00:50:05.596
I gotta bounce.

703
00:50:05.596 --> 00:50:06.429
- What? No.

704
00:50:06.429 --> 00:50:07.976
You can't bail on me.

705
00:50:07.976 --> 00:50:09.399
- I'm not bailing on you.

706
00:50:10.372 --> 00:50:12.326
Look, come with me, Ty.

707
00:50:12.326 --> 00:50:14.876
Let's just get the hell outta here.

708
00:50:14.876 --> 00:50:16.246
We can work on getting you the castle.

709
00:50:16.246 --> 00:50:17.836
- No, that'll just put you

710
00:50:17.836 --> 00:50:20.236
one Amber alert closer to a life sentence.

711
00:50:20.236 --> 00:50:21.136
- Okay, what then?

712
00:50:24.086 --> 00:50:27.569
- Lay low. They can't prove anything.

713
00:50:28.756 --> 00:50:30.146
It's her word against ours,

714
00:50:30.146 --> 00:50:32.466
and what do you think, I'd
throw you under the bus?


715
00:50:32.466 --> 00:50:35.823
- So I can't stay here,
and I got nowhere to go.


716
00:50:35.823 --> 00:50:38.066
- And you're saying it's my fault, right?

717
00:50:38.066 --> 00:50:39.043
That's what you're saying, right?

718
00:50:39.043 --> 00:50:39.906
- Hey chill, chill.

719
00:50:39.906 --> 00:50:41.076
- Don't tell me to chill.

720
00:50:41.076 --> 00:50:41.909
What do you think, 
I've ruined your life?

721
00:50:41.909 --> 00:50:42.742
- I didn't say that.

722
00:50:42.742 --> 00:50:45.566
I don't think that, but
I need you to sit down


723
00:50:45.566 --> 00:50:48.539
and chill out or
I'm gonna lose my job.

724
00:50:52.986 --> 00:50:53.819
- Sorry.

725
00:50:55.276 --> 00:50:56.176
I'm freaking, too.

726
00:50:59.912 --> 00:51:02.093
You're all I have.

727
00:51:02.093 --> 00:51:03.553
I can't lose you.

728
00:51:03.553 --> 00:51:04.386
- You won't.

729
00:51:07.976 --> 00:51:09.526
But I need to get back to work.

730
00:51:11.675 --> 00:51:12.508
- Okay.

731
00:51:33.991 --> 00:51:36.324
- I want you to see someone.

732
00:51:38.606 --> 00:51:40.586
- You mean I need to tell
someone he did something


733
00:51:40.586 --> 00:51:42.283
so you can use it against him.

734
00:51:48.076 --> 00:51:49.049
- I love you.

735
00:51:52.436 --> 00:51:55.446
And I want you to be happy again.

736
00:51:55.446 --> 00:51:56.369
- Again like when?

737
00:51:57.286 --> 00:51:58.536
Like when you beat me up?

738
00:51:59.696 --> 00:52:02.436
Like when you refused
to let me have a dad?


739
00:52:02.436 --> 00:52:05.049
To even know who he is?

740
00:52:17.661 --> 00:52:19.411
- I've made mistakes.

741
00:52:27.439 --> 00:52:30.579
I know that. Okay?

742
00:52:32.546 --> 00:52:35.806
But nothing justifies what he did to you.

743
00:52:35.806 --> 00:52:36.829
- Okay. Stop.

744
00:52:38.966 --> 00:52:43.869
He did not touch me.

745
00:52:44.876 --> 00:52:45.977
All right?

746
00:52:47.226 --> 00:52:50.556
And now he's gone, and you
got me nice and locked up


747
00:52:50.556 --> 00:52:53.666
in your prison here, so
you can just get over it.


748
00:52:53.666 --> 00:52:55.976
- The problem that we keep having

749
00:52:55.976 --> 00:52:58.816
is that you keep thinking
that I am stupid.


750
00:52:58.816 --> 00:53:01.716
- And you keep thinking
I'm a terrible person.


751
00:53:01.716 --> 00:53:02.576
- Where are you going?

752
00:53:02.576 --> 00:53:03.776
- To get some ice cream!

753
00:53:27.846 --> 00:53:29.376
Want some?

754
00:53:29.376 --> 00:53:30.209
-Sure.

755
00:53:32.606 --> 00:53:33.439
What's this?

756
00:53:45.093 --> 00:53:46.319
-Steven Colver.

757
00:53:47.506 --> 00:53:50.089
- Steven Colver is Boston's real name.

758
00:53:52.946 --> 00:53:54.936
- Wait a minute, you hacked
his credit card accounts?


759
00:53:54.936 --> 00:53:56.036
Are you nuts?

760
00:53:56.036 --> 00:53:59.196
This isn't some sort of
gray area, this is illegal.


761
00:53:59.196 --> 00:54:00.446
Oh, for Christ's sakes, Val.

762
00:54:00.446 --> 00:54:02.726
I'm a freakin' cop.

763
00:54:02.726 --> 00:54:04.666
- Devon, I have to find something.

764
00:54:04.666 --> 00:54:07.996
Listen to me, Boston is a rapist
and I'm going to prove it.


765
00:54:07.996 --> 00:54:09.636
Tylar needs to learn.

766
00:54:09.636 --> 00:54:11.779
This is not sex. It's rape.

767
00:54:19.206 --> 00:54:21.269
- You were 23 when we hooked up.

768
00:54:22.237 --> 00:54:24.459
I was 17. Underage.

769
00:54:26.006 --> 00:54:26.949
Was that rape?

770
00:54:34.966 --> 00:54:37.166
- I miss you so much.

771
00:54:37.166 --> 00:54:38.636
I don't know how much
longer I can do this,


772
00:54:38.636 --> 00:54:40.269
just seeing you an hour or two.

773
00:54:41.136 --> 00:54:44.856
- She's never gonna let us
be together, no matter what.


774
00:54:44.856 --> 00:54:45.756
- Yeah, what then?

775
00:54:47.316 --> 00:54:50.889
- If it's her
or you, I choose you.

776
00:54:53.606 --> 00:54:54.479
She has to go.

777
00:54:57.124 --> 00:54:58.224
- What do you mean go?

778
00:54:59.406 --> 00:55:01.306
- I mean, I need
to get away from her,

779
00:55:02.256 --> 00:55:04.966
and I think I
know how to do it

780
00:55:04.966 --> 00:55:07.166
- Ty, don't do anything-

781
00:55:07.166 --> 00:55:07.999
- Crazy?

782
00:55:09.096 --> 00:55:10.396
- I wasn't gonna say that.

783
00:55:12.203 --> 00:55:15.496
- All you need to know is
that I would do anything


784
00:55:15.496 --> 00:55:19.466
for us to be together, and
I know you'd do anything


785
00:55:19.466 --> 00:55:21.489
to be with me, right?

786
00:55:25.346 --> 00:55:26.246
- Do you trust me?

787
00:55:29.798 --> 00:55:30.631
- Yeah.

788
00:55:36.456 --> 00:55:37.516
- What are you
gonna do with his stuff?

789
00:55:37.516 --> 00:55:38.916
- I'm gonna fucking burn it.

790
00:55:39.886 --> 00:55:41.916
- Listen, Joanne, you know
that if you do anything


791
00:55:41.916 --> 00:55:43.229
to him or his stuff,

792
00:55:43.229 --> 00:55:45.226
it's only going to
inflame things with Tylar.


793
00:55:45.226 --> 00:55:48.146
- Okay, what are you
suggesting that I do then?


794
00:55:48.146 --> 00:55:50.656
- I'm suggesting that
you don't give up on her.


795
00:55:50.656 --> 00:55:52.056
Forget about Boston.

796
00:55:52.056 --> 00:55:53.646
Why don't you just concentrate

797
00:55:53.646 --> 00:55:55.536
on how the two
of you can move forward?

798
00:55:55.536 --> 00:55:57.326
- What are you saying, you
want me to drop the charges?


799
00:55:57.326 --> 00:55:58.956
- No, I'm saying that
you should ask yourself


800
00:55:58.956 --> 00:56:00.806
why you're this angry.

801
00:56:00.806 --> 00:56:03.496
Is it because of
what he did with Tylar,

802
00:56:03.496 --> 00:56:05.696
or is it because they
were able to fool you?


803
00:56:07.125 --> 00:56:08.786
Joanne, the harder you push this,

804
00:56:08.786 --> 00:56:11.319
the more you are going to push her.

805
00:56:12.746 --> 00:56:14.356
- I don't give a shit anymore.

806
00:56:27.886 --> 00:56:29.048
- Mom!

807
00:56:32.044 --> 00:56:33.619
What the hell are you doing?

808
00:56:34.749 --> 00:56:36.396
- Tylar, calm down, please.

809
00:56:36.396 --> 00:56:37.896
- That's not yours. 
You can't do that.

810
00:56:37.896 --> 00:56:40.382
- I'm not talking about this with you.

811
00:56:40.382 --> 00:56:42.313
- No!
- Ow! Stop it.


812
00:56:42.313 --> 00:56:43.146
Tylar, stop it!

813
00:56:43.146 --> 00:56:44.746
Stop it, you're hurting me.

814
00:56:44.746 --> 00:56:46.423
What is wrong with you?

815
00:56:46.423 --> 00:56:50.766
-  You're a disgusting bitch.

816
00:56:50.766 --> 00:56:53.316
No wonder my dad wanted
nothing to do with you.


817
00:56:53.316 --> 00:56:56.982
You're a loser. 
You're a pathetic loser.

818
00:56:56.982 --> 00:56:59.772
- Fuck!

819
00:56:59.772 --> 00:57:02.683
- Do it. Do it, Mom, do it.

820
00:57:02.683 --> 00:57:04.279
Hit me.

821
00:57:08.491 --> 00:57:10.291
- I'm not gonna hit you, baby, okay?

822
00:57:11.618 --> 00:57:14.535
You can call CPS if you want. Done.

823
00:57:37.196 --> 00:57:38.826
- Bitch.

824
00:57:51.003 --> 00:57:53.046
911. What's your emergency?

825
00:57:53.046 --> 00:57:54.606
- I need to report physical abuse.

826
00:57:54.606 --> 00:57:55.871
Name?

827
00:57:55.871 --> 00:57:56.704
- My name?

828
00:57:56.704 --> 00:57:57.537
Yes, your name.

829
00:57:57.537 --> 00:57:58.896
- Joanne Witt.

830
00:57:58.896 --> 00:58:00.546
My daughter Tylar attacked me.

831
00:58:00.546 --> 00:58:03.176
I can't take it anymore. I
need her to be taken away.


832
00:58:03.176 --> 00:58:06.136
Okay. Are
you in a safe place?


833
00:58:06.136 --> 00:58:08.821
- No, please hurry. I'm
bleeding really badly.


834
00:58:08.821 --> 00:58:12.876
Okay, okay.

835
00:58:12.876 --> 00:58:14.276
- Hello?

836
00:58:14.276 --> 00:58:15.459
This is Joanne Witt.

837
00:58:16.791 --> 00:58:18.296
That was my daughter.

838
00:58:18.296 --> 00:58:20.746
- That was your daughter?

839
00:58:20.746 --> 00:58:21.949
Are you injured?

840
00:58:21.949 --> 00:58:23.239
- Yeah.

841
00:58:23.239 --> 00:58:25.470
- Can you
describe the injury to me?


842
00:58:25.470 --> 00:58:27.887
- Why won't you let me leave?

843
00:58:30.049 --> 00:58:30.882
No!

844
00:58:42.579 --> 00:58:43.756
What do I have
to do to get removed

845
00:58:43.756 --> 00:58:45.406
and placed in foster care?

846
00:58:45.406 --> 00:58:46.876
- You admitted to attacking her.

847
00:58:46.876 --> 00:58:49.196
I can't risk the safety
of a foster family.


848
00:58:49.196 --> 00:58:51.886
- Well, then what do I have
to say to get outta here?


849
00:58:51.886 --> 00:58:53.856
- We'll finish
taking both of your statements,


850
00:58:53.856 --> 00:58:56.706
then if your mother
chooses to file charges,


851
00:58:56.706 --> 00:58:58.396
you'll be remanded to juvenile hall.

852
00:58:58.396 --> 00:59:01.209
-  Juvie? No, I can't do that.

853
00:59:02.176 --> 00:59:03.009
- Then I suggest you come

854
00:59:03.009 --> 00:59:04.726
to an understanding with your mother.

855
00:59:04.726 --> 00:59:06.173
- I wanna file charges.

856
00:59:08.286 --> 00:59:12.176
- What? No, you can't do that.

857
00:59:12.176 --> 00:59:13.169
You bitch!

858
00:59:14.326 --> 00:59:15.246
- Get her outta my sight.

859
00:59:15.246 --> 00:59:18.160
- No, no, Mom, please.

860
00:59:18.160 --> 00:59:19.794
Please, Mom, don't do this!

861
00:59:19.794 --> 00:59:22.018
Mom, Mom, please don't do this.

862
00:59:22.018 --> 00:59:23.768
Mom! No, Mom, please!

863
00:59:25.576 --> 00:59:26.409
Mom!

864
00:59:26.409 --> 00:59:29.282
- See whether a day or two
in there straightens her out,


865
00:59:29.282 --> 00:59:30.370
then we'll see.

866
01:02:16.426 --> 01:02:17.843
- Okay, got that.

867
01:02:19.246 --> 01:02:20.329
There you go.

868
01:02:22.246 --> 01:02:24.246
And let's see. This one.

869
01:02:30.281 --> 01:02:32.016
You need somethin'?

870
01:02:32.016 --> 01:02:33.269
- How about a confession?

871
01:02:35.306 --> 01:02:38.236
- I can't talk right
now, man. I'm at work.


872
01:02:38.236 --> 01:02:39.686
- You know, she kept a diary.

873
01:02:40.936 --> 01:02:42.146
- What?

874
01:02:42.146 --> 01:02:44.686
- With lots and lots of details

875
01:02:45.586 --> 01:02:48.489
of every twisted, disgusting
thing you two did together.


876
01:02:49.626 --> 01:02:52.669
Some of 'em I even had to
look up in the Kamasutra.


877
01:02:54.264 --> 01:02:56.856
Oh, to be that young and flexible again.

878
01:02:56.856 --> 01:02:57.946
- I don't know what you're talkin' about.

879
01:02:57.946 --> 01:03:01.009
- Speakin' of young, she's underage, man.

880
01:03:02.146 --> 01:03:05.516
You like having sex with
minors? You do that a lot?


881
01:03:05.516 --> 01:03:08.006
- It's not like that. I love her.

882
01:03:08.006 --> 01:03:09.279
- Oh, you love her.

883
01:03:10.457 --> 01:03:12.279
Well, let's hope she loves you, too,

884
01:03:13.126 --> 01:03:13.959
enough to wait for you,

885
01:03:13.959 --> 01:03:17.299
'cause it's gonna be a long
time before you see her again.


886
01:03:21.086 --> 01:03:22.236
- Are you arresting me?

887
01:03:24.936 --> 01:03:28.396
- I'm turning that diary
over to the sex crimes unit.


888
01:03:28.396 --> 01:03:29.409
They'll be in touch.

889
01:03:30.276 --> 01:03:33.079
In the meantime, you stay away from her.

890
01:03:34.816 --> 01:03:38.459
Or prison's gonna be the
least of your problems.


891
01:03:39.326 --> 01:03:40.159
You got me?

892
01:03:59.039 --> 01:04:01.872
- This is your last chance, Tylar.

893
01:04:03.506 --> 01:04:04.656
Do you understand that?

894
01:04:10.326 --> 01:04:13.806
I changed the code, so
if you leave the gate,


895
01:04:13.806 --> 01:04:15.416
make sure you have somewhere to go

896
01:04:15.416 --> 01:04:17.166
because you're not getting back in.

897
01:04:53.646 --> 01:04:54.509
- Give it back.

898
01:04:56.006 --> 01:04:56.839
- I can't.

899
01:04:58.256 --> 01:05:01.226
It's in an evidence locker
at the sheriff's station.


900
01:05:01.226 --> 01:05:02.686
- What?

901
01:05:02.686 --> 01:05:06.259
- Oh, you can have this back.

902
01:05:09.706 --> 01:05:10.832
You calling him?

903
01:05:12.399 --> 01:05:13.876
I don't think he's gonna answer.

904
01:05:13.876 --> 01:05:14.786
- Hello?

905
01:05:14.786 --> 01:05:16.699
Hey, just kidding. It's Boston.

906
01:05:16.699 --> 01:05:18.936
Can't get to the phone. 
Leave a message.

907
01:05:18.936 --> 01:05:21.679
- Don't you care that
you're ruining my life?


908
01:05:24.836 --> 01:05:27.806
- Dinner's gonna be
ready in about an hour.


909
01:05:27.806 --> 01:05:30.969
So you should clean the room.

910
01:05:34.487 --> 01:05:37.326
And leave this door open from now on.

911
01:05:39.916 --> 01:05:41.266
It's good to have you back.

912
01:06:34.841 --> 01:06:35.674
- Hi.

913
01:06:42.456 --> 01:06:44.148
I missed you so much.

914
01:06:44.148 --> 01:06:45.426
- I missed you, too.

915
01:06:45.426 --> 01:06:47.216
- Did you delete our text
and our call history?


916
01:06:47.216 --> 01:06:48.153
- Yeah, I did.

917
01:06:49.474 --> 01:06:50.896
But I think the phone
company still has 'em.


918
01:06:50.896 --> 01:06:52.128
- It doesn't matter.

919
01:06:52.128 --> 01:06:53.539
All they can prove is that we met.

920
01:06:53.539 --> 01:06:56.289
- That's all they need to
prove for me to go to prison.


921
01:06:59.366 --> 01:07:00.199
What?

922
01:07:01.356 --> 01:07:03.249
- Statutory rape's a felony, right?

923
01:07:04.703 --> 01:07:08.059
It means 20 years. Maybe
more, I don't know.


924
01:07:08.059 --> 01:07:09.936
But you're going to prison

925
01:07:10.916 --> 01:07:14.896
unless I say I made
everything up in my diary,


926
01:07:14.896 --> 01:07:16.726
that I was fantasizing.

927
01:07:16.726 --> 01:07:19.996
- It won't work. 
Your mom saw us.

928
01:07:19.996 --> 01:07:21.466
- Right.

929
01:07:21.466 --> 01:07:23.836
She would have to testify
for a jury to believe


930
01:07:23.836 --> 01:07:25.947
what's in the diary and convict.

931
01:07:25.947 --> 01:07:29.479
- You said it yourself, there's
no way she won't testify.


932
01:07:32.189 --> 01:07:33.729
- What if she can't testify?

933
01:07:37.257 --> 01:07:39.876
- No. No.

934
01:07:39.876 --> 01:07:40.709
- Yes.
- No, I'm not even


935
01:07:40.709 --> 01:07:41.542
gonna go there.

936
01:07:41.542 --> 01:07:42.959
- What choice do we have?

937
01:07:44.576 --> 01:07:48.666
Either you can go to prison
until you're middle-aged


938
01:07:48.666 --> 01:07:50.516
and we'll never see each other again,

939
01:07:51.366 --> 01:07:54.136
or we can be together forever

940
01:07:54.136 --> 01:07:55.566
and no one will get in the way.

941
01:07:55.566 --> 01:07:56.566
It's a no brainer.

942
01:07:56.566 --> 01:07:58.109
- No, that is not who we are.

943
01:07:59.196 --> 01:08:01.456
- She made us that.

944
01:08:06.363 --> 01:08:07.946
It's not our fault.

945
01:08:19.785 --> 01:08:21.452
- I love you, Tylar.

946
01:08:22.953 --> 01:08:25.079
- It can be like this always.

947
01:08:52.557 --> 01:08:54.606
- Need you at the register.

948
01:08:54.606 --> 01:08:56.986
- I'm not comfortable
going up front today.


949
01:08:56.986 --> 01:08:58.843
- Come on, I
let you keep your job.

950
01:09:00.305 --> 01:09:03.859
- I know, and that's cool of you,

951
01:09:03.859 --> 01:09:07.156
but I'd rather quit
than go out there today.


952
01:10:24.362 --> 01:10:25.279
- Come on.

953
01:10:30.603 --> 01:10:31.436
Is that them?

954
01:10:31.436 --> 01:10:33.106
- Let's just get outta here, okay?

955
01:10:33.966 --> 01:10:35.228
Come on, we can go to Belize.

956
01:10:35.228 --> 01:10:36.133
We can go anywhere.
- No we can't.


957
01:10:36.133 --> 01:10:38.876
I'm a minor, remember?

958
01:10:38.876 --> 01:10:41.249
I can't leave the country
without Satan's permission.


959
01:10:42.636 --> 01:10:44.953
This is the only
way we can be together.

960
01:10:47.114 --> 01:10:48.970
Here, let me see them.

961
01:11:13.918 --> 01:11:17.386
- What if she
wakes up before we can...

962
01:11:17.386 --> 01:11:20.336
- She might have had a
Valium or four in her wine.


963
01:11:22.529 --> 01:11:23.362
Come on.

964
01:12:05.553 --> 01:12:06.386
- Tylar!

965
01:13:40.018 --> 01:13:42.101
- Ty. What are you doing?

966
01:14:44.189 --> 01:14:45.929
- We're free.

967
01:14:45.929 --> 01:14:47.512
- Together forever.

968
01:15:30.586 --> 01:15:31.830
- I'm starving.

969
01:15:31.830 --> 01:15:36.247
- Go ahead and get started.
I'll be down in a minute.


970
01:16:27.849 --> 01:16:29.219
- So I was thinking.

971
01:16:31.521 --> 01:16:33.349
We can do whatever we want now, right?

972
01:16:36.696 --> 01:16:39.229
- Well what I
want is to marry you

973
01:16:42.213 --> 01:16:46.016
and start a family
as soon as it's legal.

974
01:16:46.016 --> 01:16:49.656
- Wait, are you proposing to me?

975
01:16:49.656 --> 01:16:51.687
- I wanna get you a ring.

976
01:16:51.687 --> 01:16:52.987
- Yes! Yes, yes, yes, yes.

977
01:17:00.216 --> 01:17:03.189
I didn't think
that I could be this happy.


978
01:17:04.336 --> 01:17:08.129
You make me so, so, so happy.

979
01:17:09.722 --> 01:17:11.006
- So it's official then?

980
01:17:11.006 --> 01:17:12.679
- Yes, my fiance.

981
01:17:13.696 --> 01:17:17.459
You're looking at the
future Mrs. Tylar Colver.


982
01:17:18.561 --> 01:17:19.394
- Oh.

983
01:17:23.686 --> 01:17:24.519
I like that.

984
01:17:44.316 --> 01:17:47.286
You
have one new message.


985
01:17:47.286 --> 01:17:49.256
- Hey, Jojo, I saw
your car in the driveway.


986
01:17:49.256 --> 01:17:50.566
Is everything okay?

987
01:17:50.566 --> 01:17:52.426
Let me know if
we're still on for lunch.

988
01:17:52.426 --> 01:17:53.586
Call me.

989
01:17:53.586 --> 01:17:55.236
- What do we do?

990
01:17:55.236 --> 01:17:56.069
- We stay calm.

991
01:18:03.696 --> 01:18:05.719
- Honey. Honey.

992
01:18:07.923 --> 01:18:09.506
- What. What is it?

993
01:18:11.058 --> 01:18:14.406
- It's 11 o'clock and Joanne
hasn't called me back yet.


994
01:18:14.406 --> 01:18:17.249
It's gonna be a hundred degrees
and they have a fire going.


995
01:18:19.413 --> 01:18:21.686
- You want me go to over there?

996
01:18:36.530 --> 01:18:37.613
There you go.

997
01:18:39.053 --> 01:18:40.086
- What are you doing?

998
01:18:40.086 --> 01:18:42.376
- Joanne says she's going back to bed.

999
01:18:42.376 --> 01:18:44.436
So am I.

1000
01:18:44.436 --> 01:18:47.086
Just be happy she and Tylar
are gettin' along, honey.


1001
01:18:51.631 --> 01:18:53.537
- You think she bought it?

1002
01:18:53.537 --> 01:18:54.386
- I don't know.

1003
01:18:54.386 --> 01:18:56.209
Val is a serious pain in my ass.

1004
01:18:58.668 --> 01:19:00.119
- What are you doing?

1005
01:19:01.036 --> 01:19:02.586
- Mom is emailing sick to work.

1006
01:19:03.606 --> 01:19:05.016
We should have done that hours ago.

1007
01:19:05.016 --> 01:19:06.316
We have to be more careful.

1008
01:19:06.316 --> 01:19:08.256
- Okay, so it's Friday.

1009
01:19:08.256 --> 01:19:10.259
What if she doesn't get better by Monday?

1010
01:19:11.316 --> 01:19:13.166
- We will worry about that on Monday.

1011
01:19:14.886 --> 01:19:17.326
Hey, you know what we should now?

1012
01:19:17.326 --> 01:19:18.866
Engagement party.

1013
01:19:18.866 --> 01:19:21.656
We'll invite all our friends over. Yeah?

1014
01:19:21.656 --> 01:19:23.381
- What friends?

1015
01:19:23.381 --> 01:19:25.696
- Come on, we're getting married.

1016
01:19:25.696 --> 01:19:28.379
They'll have to accept us now. You'll see.

1017
01:19:29.266 --> 01:19:30.916
How about you call God

1018
01:19:30.916 --> 01:19:34.006
and I'll call Squishy and Graham Cracker?

1019
01:19:35.886 --> 01:19:36.816
- Party?

1020
01:19:36.816 --> 01:19:37.716
-  Par-tay!

1021
01:19:42.146 --> 01:19:42.979
- Deal.

1022
01:19:48.216 --> 01:19:50.696
- Yeah, and maybe you could bring, like,

1023
01:19:50.696 --> 01:19:52.079
some beer or whatever?

1024
01:19:52.966 --> 01:19:55.226
If we leave, we can't get back in.

1025
01:19:55.226 --> 01:19:56.570
Long story.

1026
01:19:59.496 --> 01:20:00.496
Squishy, I gotta go.

1027
01:20:03.926 --> 01:20:06.276
Damn, I can't believe my
mom gave her the code.


1028
01:20:08.494 --> 01:20:10.426
- We gotta pretend not to be here.

1029
01:20:10.426 --> 01:20:12.396
- No, it won't work.

1030
01:20:12.396 --> 01:20:14.996
She's like a rabid dog.
She won't go away easily.


1031
01:20:14.996 --> 01:20:16.179
- Okay, what then?

1032
01:20:17.677 --> 01:20:19.022
- We have to be ready.

1033
01:20:19.855 --> 01:20:20.688
For anything.

1034
01:20:24.386 --> 01:20:25.986
- Hi, Val.

1035
01:20:25.986 --> 01:20:27.416
- No school today?

1036
01:20:27.416 --> 01:20:29.836
- Mom and I were up really late.

1037
01:20:29.836 --> 01:20:32.106
So she said it
was cool if I skipped.

1038
01:20:32.106 --> 01:20:35.376
- Yeah, I heard you patched things up.

1039
01:20:35.376 --> 01:20:36.776
- Started to.

1040
01:20:36.776 --> 01:20:37.689
- Sounds hopeful.

1041
01:20:39.216 --> 01:20:40.566
It's awfully dark in there.

1042
01:20:41.966 --> 01:20:44.296
- Yeah, Mom's got a migraine,

1043
01:20:44.296 --> 01:20:46.826
so the light really bothers her.

1044
01:20:46.826 --> 01:20:47.756
- I made soup.

1045
01:20:47.756 --> 01:20:49.076
It'll just take me a minute to microwave

1046
01:20:49.076 --> 01:20:50.286
and then I can take it to her.

1047
01:20:50.286 --> 01:20:53.086
- She's sleeping, so I'll
just take it to her later.


1048
01:20:53.086 --> 01:20:54.879
- It's okay. I'll do it.

1049
01:20:55.866 --> 01:20:57.016
I wanna see her myself.

1050
01:20:58.116 --> 01:20:59.779
- Okay, but she's resting.

1051
01:21:00.791 --> 01:21:02.339
- Joanne!

1052
01:21:05.496 --> 01:21:06.329
Hey, honey.

1053
01:21:08.226 --> 01:21:09.926
Oh God, I'm so sorry.

1054
01:21:09.926 --> 01:21:12.379
No. No, no, no, 
I'll go with you.

1055
01:21:15.490 --> 01:21:16.636
- Is something wrong?

1056
01:21:16.636 --> 01:21:18.766
- Yeah, Devon's mom was
just rushed to the hospital.


1057
01:21:18.766 --> 01:21:19.866
They think she had a stroke.

1058
01:21:19.866 --> 01:21:21.586
-  Oh no. I hope she's okay.

1059
01:21:21.586 --> 01:21:22.856
- Tell your mom to call me.

1060
01:21:22.856 --> 01:21:25.419
- I will. For sure.

1061
01:21:42.038 --> 01:21:44.176
- So you and Colton, huh?

1062
01:21:44.176 --> 01:21:46.096
- Yeah, I guess.

1063
01:21:46.096 --> 01:21:48.649
It's only been a couple
days, so we'll see.


1064
01:21:49.867 --> 01:21:50.767
- So we cool then?

1065
01:21:53.676 --> 01:21:55.219
- You really like her, huh?

1066
01:21:59.096 --> 01:21:59.979
- She's my life.

1067
01:22:04.346 --> 01:22:05.179
- Then yeah.

1068
01:22:07.286 --> 01:22:09.453
I'm happy that you're happy.

1069
01:22:14.606 --> 01:22:16.259
- So I guess your mom's chill now?

1070
01:22:17.166 --> 01:22:17.999
- Yeah.

1071
01:22:18.939 --> 01:22:20.626
I mean, took her a while, but...

1072
01:22:21.746 --> 01:22:24.116
Anyway, she's on board now.

1073
01:22:24.116 --> 01:22:25.988
- Everyone I know is getting married.

1074
01:22:25.988 --> 01:22:28.970
My dad is making
me go to Tahoe this weekend


1075
01:22:28.970 --> 01:22:30.293
to meet his new toy.

1076
01:22:30.293 --> 01:22:31.126
-  Ew.

1077
01:22:31.126 --> 01:22:32.846
- Awkward much?
- Yeah.


1078
01:22:32.846 --> 01:22:33.679
- Hey, babe?

1079
01:22:35.386 --> 01:22:36.219
Wanna go inside?

1080
01:22:37.313 --> 01:22:38.146
- One sec.

1081
01:22:55.643 --> 01:22:56.674
- No, no more.

1082
01:22:56.674 --> 01:22:57.589
Oh my God, do
not get my hair wet!

1083
01:23:07.536 --> 01:23:11.029
- So, you guys started
planning the wedding?


1084
01:23:12.145 --> 01:23:14.789
- Nah, we got plenty of
time to figure that out.


1085
01:23:16.465 --> 01:23:18.048
- What if we don't?

1086
01:23:19.745 --> 01:23:21.917
- What do you mean?

1087
01:23:21.917 --> 01:23:25.076
- Till death do us part, right?

1088
01:23:25.076 --> 01:23:26.641
- Yeah.

1089
01:23:26.641 --> 01:23:30.047
One way or another we're staying together.

1090
01:23:30.047 --> 01:23:31.136
What are you guys talking about?

1091
01:23:31.136 --> 01:23:35.236
I thought your mom said that
she was cool with you guys.


1092
01:23:35.236 --> 01:23:37.879
- Yeah, well she doesn't have
much to say about it anymore.


1093
01:23:38.926 --> 01:23:40.425
Why?

1094
01:23:40.425 --> 01:23:42.476
I thought that she
was on a business trip?

1095
01:23:42.476 --> 01:23:43.826
How long is it supposed to last?

1096
01:23:43.826 --> 01:23:46.459
- Dude, she's not coming back.

1097
01:23:48.446 --> 01:23:51.859
- You guys are, like, starting
to freak me out a little bit.


1098
01:23:55.664 --> 01:23:56.497
What?

1099
01:24:00.656 --> 01:24:01.606
- Oh my God.

1100
01:24:01.606 --> 01:24:03.128
- Seriously.

1101
01:24:03.128 --> 01:24:05.259
- Oh my God. What the fuck?

1102
01:24:06.409 --> 01:24:07.742
- What the hell?

1103
01:24:08.726 --> 01:24:10.296
They're having a party?

1104
01:24:10.296 --> 01:24:13.510
- She said they were
getting along better, but...


1105
01:24:13.510 --> 01:24:14.806
- Oh come on.

1106
01:24:14.806 --> 01:24:16.646
She's so sick she
can't get out of bed

1107
01:24:16.646 --> 01:24:18.196
and now she's throwing a party?

1108
01:24:20.585 --> 01:24:21.918
- What the fuck?

1109
01:24:26.446 --> 01:24:27.486
- She's not gonna go away.

1110
01:24:27.486 --> 01:24:28.661
- The hell she won't.
- Who?


1111
01:24:28.661 --> 01:24:29.494
- Boston, you can't.

1112
01:24:29.494 --> 01:24:30.818
She doesn't know you're here.

1113
01:24:33.705 --> 01:24:35.705
Hey, stop. Boston, wait!

1114
01:24:37.392 --> 01:24:39.891
- Fuck.

1115
01:24:42.026 --> 01:24:44.779
Oh fuck. Oh fuck.

1116
01:24:47.286 --> 01:24:48.146
- You're trespassing.

1117
01:24:48.146 --> 01:24:49.756
- Why are you even here?

1118
01:24:49.756 --> 01:24:50.796
Where's Joanne?

1119
01:24:50.796 --> 01:24:51.996
- You heard him.

1120
01:24:51.996 --> 01:24:53.346
You're on private property.

1121
01:24:54.256 --> 01:24:56.806
You broke through our
gate. That's illegal.


1122
01:24:56.806 --> 01:24:59.436
- That's not gonna fly. Where is she?

1123
01:24:59.436 --> 01:25:00.536
- All right, step aside.

1124
01:25:00.536 --> 01:25:01.436
-  You're not coming in.

1125
01:25:01.436 --> 01:25:03.406
- Nobody gets in without warrant.

1126
01:25:03.406 --> 01:25:06.156
- You got it. We'll be back.

1127
01:25:06.156 --> 01:25:07.376
And when we are,

1128
01:25:07.376 --> 01:25:10.226
she better be upstairs with
a cold compress on her head.


1129
01:25:12.496 --> 01:25:13.746
Come on, honey.

1130
01:25:25.940 --> 01:25:28.900
Hi.

1131
01:25:28.900 --> 01:25:30.317
Mm-mm, he's fine.

1132
01:25:31.890 --> 01:25:33.601
- So I guess your mom's chill now?

1133
01:25:33.601 --> 01:25:34.950
- Yeah.

1134
01:25:34.950 --> 01:25:37.706
I mean it took a while

1135
01:25:43.146 --> 01:25:44.605
- So nice to meet you.

1136
01:25:44.605 --> 01:25:46.837
- It's great meeting you. 
Congratulations.

1137
01:25:46.837 --> 01:25:47.670
- Bye!

1138
01:25:51.053 --> 01:25:52.429
- What, man?

1139
01:25:52.429 --> 01:25:54.226
What do you want, Boston?

1140
01:25:56.972 --> 01:26:01.139
- You're not gonna tell
anybody about this, right?


1141
01:26:04.976 --> 01:26:08.597
- What's gonna happen to you guys?

1142
01:26:08.597 --> 01:26:13.097
- We're gonna be together
and that's all that matters.


1143
01:26:14.173 --> 01:26:15.006
Okay?

1144
01:26:29.396 --> 01:26:31.404
- Okay, so how
long does a warrant take?

1145
01:26:31.404 --> 01:26:32.237
- I don't know.

1146
01:26:32.237 --> 01:26:33.156
I mean, it depends how fast

1147
01:26:33.156 --> 01:26:35.226
they can find a judge on the weekend.

1148
01:26:35.226 --> 01:26:36.856
- Okay, so we need
to move Mom like now.

1149
01:26:36.856 --> 01:26:38.116
- How? How?

1150
01:26:38.116 --> 01:26:40.146
The bitch next door is literally watching

1151
01:26:40.146 --> 01:26:41.319
every move we make.

1152
01:26:41.319 --> 01:26:44.096
I mean, even if we can
get the body out, which...


1153
01:26:45.856 --> 01:26:48.736
The gate is the only way
out, and if we leave,


1154
01:26:48.736 --> 01:26:50.109
it's open season on us.

1155
01:26:52.666 --> 01:26:57.666
- Okay, so everyone's against us.

1156
01:26:59.256 --> 01:27:01.306
They're never gonna let us live together.

1157
01:27:02.296 --> 01:27:03.576
- The only thing
we can do now is-

1158
01:27:03.576 --> 01:27:04.599
- Die together.

1159
01:27:14.456 --> 01:27:15.756
- I promised you a castle.

1160
01:27:17.424 --> 01:27:19.424
- I don't need a
castle if I've got you.

1161
01:27:26.605 --> 01:27:29.756
-You haven't said
much since we left the party.


1162
01:27:29.756 --> 01:27:31.449
What did Boston say to you?

1163
01:27:33.253 --> 01:27:35.493
- Nothing, nothing important.

1164
01:27:36.406 --> 01:27:37.529
God, are you okay?

1165
01:27:39.166 --> 01:27:40.229
You can talk to me.

1166
01:27:43.120 --> 01:27:44.220
- I need you to leave.

1167
01:27:45.114 --> 01:27:47.539
Why? Why?

1168
01:27:48.986 --> 01:27:50.406
- Just leave.

1169
01:27:50.406 --> 01:27:51.256
- You're serious.

1170
01:27:55.206 --> 01:27:56.039
Okay.

1171
01:28:18.606 --> 01:28:19.673
- God?
- Yeah.


1172
01:28:19.673 --> 01:28:20.522
- What's up?

1173
01:28:20.522 --> 01:28:22.849
- I need you guys to
come to La Cantina now.


1174
01:28:22.849 --> 01:28:23.682
- Now? Why?

1175
01:28:23.682 --> 01:28:25.908
- I can't, just come. I'll
tell you when you get here.


1176
01:28:25.908 --> 01:28:27.197
- Okay. Be there in 10.

1177
01:28:27.197 --> 01:28:28.197
- Okay. Bye.

1178
01:29:00.956 --> 01:29:02.546
- Fuck, fuck, fuck.

1179
01:29:02.546 --> 01:29:03.889
- Man, I hate that woman.

1180
01:29:15.924 --> 01:29:16.757
- Okay.

1181
01:29:34.829 --> 01:29:35.872
- Joanne?

1182
01:29:45.921 --> 01:29:46.754
Joanne?

1183
01:29:48.817 --> 01:29:49.650
Jo? No!

1184
01:29:51.500 --> 01:29:52.583
- V!
- No! No!


1185
01:29:53.671 --> 01:29:57.355
- It's me, it's me.

1186
01:29:57.355 --> 01:29:58.188
It's okay.

1187
01:29:59.235 --> 01:30:02.389
- No!

1188
01:30:02.389 --> 01:30:05.356
I told you.

1189
01:30:05.356 --> 01:30:06.189
- It's me.

1190
01:30:07.796 --> 01:30:09.603
- Why didn't you tell
us about this before?


1191
01:30:09.603 --> 01:30:12.743
- But seriously, why
are you telling us now?


1192
01:30:12.743 --> 01:30:15.056
You just made us accessories to murder!

1193
01:30:15.056 --> 01:30:18.896
- We need to call the police.

1194
01:30:18.896 --> 01:30:20.926
- No. No, man.

1195
01:30:20.926 --> 01:30:22.416
- What are you talking about?
- I did this.


1196
01:30:22.416 --> 01:30:23.946
They met because of me.

1197
01:30:23.946 --> 01:30:25.436
- We need to get our shit together.

1198
01:30:25.436 --> 01:30:29.156
Okay, we need to do something about this

1199
01:30:29.156 --> 01:30:31.316
before they do anything else.

1200
01:30:31.316 --> 01:30:32.149
- Like what?

1201
01:30:32.149 --> 01:30:33.726
- I don't know, man.

1202
01:30:33.726 --> 01:30:35.509
They were talking some crazy shit.

1203
01:30:36.645 --> 01:30:38.709
Till death do us part shit.

1204
01:31:15.876 --> 01:31:16.709
- Let's do this.

1205
01:31:20.543 --> 01:31:23.216
- Okay, the sooner
we go to the police,

1206
01:31:23.216 --> 01:31:25.799
the less we're a part of this, right?

1207
01:31:25.799 --> 01:31:27.416
- How do we
even know this is true?

1208
01:31:27.416 --> 01:31:29.489
Maybe they're just messing with your head.

1209
01:31:30.535 --> 01:31:32.406
- No man.

1210
01:31:32.406 --> 01:31:36.589
You weren't there, but they're
in some fucked mental place.


1211
01:31:38.746 --> 01:31:41.166
- I was supposed to be
in Tahoe two hours ago,


1212
01:31:41.166 --> 01:31:44.626
so as far as I'm concerned,
I never heard any of this.


1213
01:31:44.626 --> 01:31:46.326
- Even if they're really suicidal.

1214
01:31:51.776 --> 01:31:53.756
- What the hell are you guys doing?

1215
01:31:53.756 --> 01:31:55.326
- Eloping.

1216
01:31:55.326 --> 01:31:57.023
- To where?

1217
01:31:57.023 --> 01:31:57.916
- Look, it doesn't matter.

1218
01:31:57.916 --> 01:31:59.016
Okay, Squishy.

1219
01:31:59.016 --> 01:32:01.365
I left Ty's bag behind
your house in our spot.


1220
01:32:01.365 --> 01:32:02.707
You know what I'm talking about?

1221
01:32:02.707 --> 01:32:03.896
- Yeah, but...

1222
01:32:03.896 --> 01:32:06.307
- Go get it
and then call me, okay?

1223
01:32:06.307 --> 01:32:08.766
- Ty, don't do this.

1224
01:32:08.766 --> 01:32:11.099
Whatever you're doing,
we can figure a way out.


1225
01:32:11.099 --> 01:32:13.486
- I'm not looking
for a way out, Graham.

1226
01:32:13.486 --> 01:32:15.178
I already have one.

1227
01:32:15.178 --> 01:32:16.476
What does that mean?

1228
01:32:16.476 --> 01:32:19.286
- Please, just tell us where you're going.

1229
01:32:19.286 --> 01:32:20.486
-  To our castle.

1230
01:32:21.476 --> 01:32:22.339
- What castle?

1231
01:32:24.956 --> 01:32:26.123
What the fuck?

1232
01:32:33.777 --> 01:32:35.586
Liberty 25, code 6.

1233
01:32:35.586 --> 01:32:37.003
105 North Avenue.

1234
01:32:43.716 --> 01:32:46.666
- They won't get very far. 
There's a BOLO.

1235
01:32:46.666 --> 01:32:48.586
- Credit card purchases on the mom's card

1236
01:32:48.586 --> 01:32:50.210
point to maybe Tahoe.

1237
01:32:50.210 --> 01:32:51.360
- All right, thank you.

1238
01:32:52.356 --> 01:32:54.316
Well, are we done here?

1239
01:32:54.316 --> 01:32:56.496
I'd like to get
my wife home to rest.

1240
01:32:56.496 --> 01:32:57.329
- Of course.

1241
01:32:59.506 --> 01:33:00.763
- Come on, honey.

1242
01:33:01.946 --> 01:33:02.913
Come on, honey.

1243
01:33:09.856 --> 01:33:11.116
All right, what are you up to?

1244
01:33:11.116 --> 01:33:12.419
- Investigating fraud.

1245
01:33:13.896 --> 01:33:15.696
These are the purchases
made on Joanne's credit card


1246
01:33:15.696 --> 01:33:17.346
in the last five hours.

1247
01:33:17.346 --> 01:33:20.896
- Gas station, mini mart,
another gas station.


1248
01:33:20.896 --> 01:33:23.436
All in the direction of the mountains.

1249
01:33:23.436 --> 01:33:25.623
Could be headin' for Tahoe, maybe.

1250
01:33:25.623 --> 01:33:27.196
- Except look.

1251
01:33:27.196 --> 01:33:30.876
This mini mart is 20 miles
past the first gas station.


1252
01:33:30.876 --> 01:33:33.126
The second gas station
is 20 miles past that.


1253
01:33:34.866 --> 01:33:37.079
Who stops every 20 miles to get gas?

1254
01:33:38.323 --> 01:33:40.379
And make regular purchases?

1255
01:33:41.926 --> 01:33:43.366
- Somebody wants us to believe

1256
01:33:43.366 --> 01:33:44.754
they're heading for the mountains.

1257
01:33:52.836 --> 01:33:53.669
- I'm telling you,

1258
01:33:53.669 --> 01:33:55.146
they've got you on a wild goose chase.

1259
01:33:55.146 --> 01:33:57.506
- Listen to her. She knows
what she's talking about.


1260
01:33:57.506 --> 01:33:59.426
- Even if they did throw
us off their scent,


1261
01:33:59.426 --> 01:34:01.816
their plates will be caught
by the BOLO sooner or later.


1262
01:34:01.816 --> 01:34:04.216
- Do we want
'em found sooner or later?

1263
01:34:04.216 --> 01:34:05.916
- They ditch the
car, it's gonna be later,

1264
01:34:05.916 --> 01:34:07.096
maybe too much later.

1265
01:34:07.096 --> 01:34:08.386
- I need Joanne's phone.

1266
01:34:08.386 --> 01:34:09.456
- It's been bagged for evidence.

1267
01:34:09.456 --> 01:34:11.236
I can't let you handle it.

1268
01:34:11.236 --> 01:34:12.416
- Look, that phone'll have calls

1269
01:34:12.416 --> 01:34:13.849
to and from Colver's number.

1270
01:34:13.849 --> 01:34:14.682
- I get that.

1271
01:34:14.682 --> 01:34:16.336
- It's a shortcut to tracking his cell.

1272
01:34:16.336 --> 01:34:17.886
- Maybe we'll get lucky.

1273
01:34:17.886 --> 01:34:19.816
- I can't just
break the chain of custody.

1274
01:34:19.816 --> 01:34:21.366
We may need it to put him away.

1275
01:34:23.463 --> 01:34:26.686
- One of Tylar and Colver's
friends just called 911.


1276
01:34:26.686 --> 01:34:27.726
You were right.

1277
01:34:27.726 --> 01:34:29.526
They sent her phone and
the mom's credit card


1278
01:34:29.526 --> 01:34:30.726
off with someone else.

1279
01:34:30.726 --> 01:34:31.726
Get the vic's phone.

1280
01:34:33.026 --> 01:34:34.747
It's a good thing.

1281
01:34:49.487 --> 01:34:52.167
- It's cheesier than I remember.

1282
01:34:54.676 --> 01:34:57.409
- According to Yelp it's
been closed for years.


1283
01:34:58.596 --> 01:34:59.449
- That sucks.

1284
01:35:00.706 --> 01:35:03.106
But hey, at least I got
to see it one more time.


1285
01:35:05.246 --> 01:35:06.896
- They could be crossing a border

1286
01:35:06.896 --> 01:35:08.966
or hurting somebody else right now.

1287
01:35:08.966 --> 01:35:10.386
- So you're sure their
friend really doesn't know


1288
01:35:10.386 --> 01:35:11.586
where they're headed, huh?

1289
01:35:11.586 --> 01:35:13.176
- We shook him down pretty good.

1290
01:35:13.176 --> 01:35:14.576
I don't think he was lying.

1291
01:35:14.576 --> 01:35:17.756
All they told him was
something about a castle,


1292
01:35:17.756 --> 01:35:19.286
but he didn't know what that meant.

1293
01:35:19.286 --> 01:35:22.139
- A castle. Follow me.

1294
01:35:23.246 --> 01:35:24.396
- So what do we do now?

1295
01:35:27.176 --> 01:35:28.726
- Let's find somewhere to stay.

1296
01:35:41.546 --> 01:35:42.416
- The castle restaurant

1297
01:35:42.416 --> 01:35:44.516
Joanne took Tylar to for her birthday.

1298
01:35:44.516 --> 01:35:47.626
She said Tylar thought it
was the best day of her life.


1299
01:35:47.626 --> 01:35:48.576
Let's go.

1300
01:35:48.576 --> 01:35:49.610
- Where are you going?

1301
01:35:49.610 --> 01:35:54.610
- L.A.

1302
01:36:17.182 --> 01:36:18.182
- I'm sorry.

1303
01:36:20.016 --> 01:36:20.866
- Doesn't matter.

1304
01:36:26.366 --> 01:36:27.636
Place is perfect.

1305
01:37:20.786 --> 01:37:22.939
I promise I'll always be yours.

1306
01:37:25.866 --> 01:37:29.779
- You, Tylar
Witt, are my forever,


1307
01:37:30.956 --> 01:37:34.031
and I promise always to be yours.

1308
01:38:17.860 --> 01:38:22.326
- You never told me why
they call you Boston.


1309
01:38:24.579 --> 01:38:29.206
- When I was younger, I
had a speech impediment.


1310
01:38:29.206 --> 01:38:33.996
I couldn't say my Rs, so
people thought I sounded


1311
01:38:33.996 --> 01:38:36.119
like I had a Massachusetts accent.

1312
01:38:38.176 --> 01:38:42.659
So they called me Boston and it stuck.

1313
01:38:45.309 --> 01:38:48.736
- That's dumb.

1314
01:39:18.126 --> 01:39:18.959
- What did he say?

1315
01:39:18.959 --> 01:39:20.436
- They're confirming he's in L.A.,

1316
01:39:20.436 --> 01:39:23.036
triangulating his phone now
to get an exact location.


1317
01:39:23.036 --> 01:39:23.869
- To where?

1318
01:39:23.869 --> 01:39:25.156
- They're sending local units.

1319
01:39:25.156 --> 01:39:25.989
- Where?

1320
01:39:25.989 --> 01:39:27.519
- They asked us not to interfere.

1321
01:39:46.641 --> 01:39:49.273
- No, no, no, no.

1322
01:39:49.273 --> 01:39:51.586
No, you said you wouldn't leave me.

1323
01:40:11.196 --> 01:40:13.079
You swore you'd stay with me.

1324
01:40:13.079 --> 01:40:14.844
- Police, open up!
- Boston.


1325
01:40:14.844 --> 01:40:16.698
Don't leave me.

1326
01:42:02.774 --> 01:42:03.796
-Too bad you didn't consume

1327
01:42:03.796 --> 01:42:05.346
more of that rat poison.

1328
01:42:05.346 --> 01:42:08.126
So, now that you're gonna live, tell me,

1329
01:42:08.126 --> 01:42:09.469
did Tylar make you do it?

1330
01:42:10.516 --> 01:42:11.616
- I'm tellin' ya, man.

1331
01:42:12.766 --> 01:42:14.466
Ty had nothing to do with it.

1332
01:42:14.466 --> 01:42:17.316
- So you two made sure to get
your stories straight, huh?


1333
01:42:18.236 --> 01:42:21.999
Just in case death
didn't quite do you part.


1334
01:42:23.805 --> 01:42:25.373
Haven't heard that one before.

1335
01:42:27.016 --> 01:42:29.169
You two are a piece of work.

1336
01:42:30.646 --> 01:42:31.649
- I couldn't go in.

1337
01:42:32.676 --> 01:42:37.036
- It was all me. 
I stabbed her.

1338
01:42:37.036 --> 01:42:38.836
- I just curled up outside her door.

1339
01:42:40.666 --> 01:42:41.766
And she was screaming.

1340
01:42:42.876 --> 01:42:47.876
So, I put my hands over
my ears and I hummed.


1341
01:42:49.726 --> 01:42:50.559
- I killed her.

1342
01:42:53.066 --> 01:42:54.339
- Guess that's love.

1343
01:42:58.896 --> 01:43:00.339
You wanted her dead.

1344
01:43:01.686 --> 01:43:04.481
You've been quoted as
saying that many times.


1345
01:43:04.481 --> 01:43:07.909
- No. No, I loved my mom.

1346
01:43:09.516 --> 01:43:10.889
I miss her so much.

1347
01:43:14.986 --> 01:43:16.349
- 20 stab wounds.

1348
01:43:18.136 --> 01:43:20.386
The one to her neck
nearly took her head off.


1349
01:43:22.626 --> 01:43:26.299
That's not love. That's rage.

1350
01:43:41.646 --> 01:43:43.856
It's a tragedy that three
lives had to be ruined


1351
01:43:43.856 --> 01:43:47.636
just to save you the inconvenience
of a slap on the wrist.


1352
01:43:47.636 --> 01:43:50.856
- 20 years for felony rape
ain't a slap on the wrist, man.


1353
01:43:50.856 --> 01:43:53.356
- Neither's life in prison
or a stay on death row.


1354
01:43:55.781 --> 01:43:58.086
Boy, where'd you get 20 years?

1355
01:43:58.086 --> 01:43:59.656
Worst you woulda faced for statutory

1356
01:43:59.656 --> 01:44:03.316
is a misdemeanor charge,
most likely probation.


1357
01:44:03.316 --> 01:44:04.559
No jail time.

1358
01:44:06.216 --> 01:44:08.706
- You said I would go
away for a long time.


1359
01:44:08.706 --> 01:44:10.849
- I wanted you
to stay away from Tylar.

1360
01:44:12.216 --> 01:44:15.409
Who gave you the
idea you'd do 20 years?

1361
01:44:18.126 --> 01:44:23.126
- Ty, what'd you do to me?
♪ I need a lot of space ♪


1362
01:44:26.220 --> 01:44:28.687
No, Ty, tell me you love me.

1363
01:44:28.687 --> 01:44:30.194
Tylar, tell them that you love me.

1364
01:44:30.194 --> 01:44:31.198
Look at me, Ty.

1365
01:44:31.198 --> 01:44:32.550
Ty, fucking look at me!

1366
01:44:32.550 --> 01:44:34.290
Fucking look at me, Ty!

1367
01:44:34.290 --> 01:44:36.150
You fucking did this, Ty!

1368
01:44:36.150 --> 01:44:39.370
She fucking did it! 
She fucking did it!
