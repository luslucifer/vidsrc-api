00:05:06.673 --> 00:05:09.842
<i>A little white house...</i>

2
00:05:10.051 --> 00:05:13.638
<i>Lingers in my memory...</i>

3
00:05:13.888 --> 00:05:16.975
<i>Of that little white house...</i>

4
00:05:17.308 --> 00:05:20.186
<i>I dream each night...</i>

5
00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:23.731
<i>The windows of that little house...</i>

6
00:05:23.982 --> 00:05:27.276
<i>Beautifully shine in the sun...</i>

7
00:05:27.652 --> 00:05:30.863
<i>As if someone's eyes...</i>

8
00:05:31.155 --> 00:05:33.992
<i>Were filling with tears...</i>

9
00:05:34.367 --> 00:05:37.996
<i>There was so much happiness
in that little house...</i>


10
00:05:38.246 --> 00:05:40.581
<i>And so many joyous days...</i>

11
00:05:40.832 --> 00:05:44.252
<i>When I remember
those blissful moments...</i>


12
00:05:44.335 --> 00:05:47.463
<i>My heart trembles...</i>

13
00:05:47.839 --> 00:05:51.259
<i>A little white house...</i>

14
00:05:51.467 --> 00:05:54.512
<i>Lingers in my memory...</i>

15
00:05:55.096 --> 00:05:58.266
<i>Of that little white house...</i>

16
00:05:58.599 --> 00:06:01.269
<i>I dream each night...</i>

17
00:06:08.943 --> 00:06:10.403
<i>He was 13 1/2 years old.</i>

18
00:06:10.486 --> 00:06:14.532
<i>He had a lovely singing voice
and we heard him.</i>


19
00:06:14.615 --> 00:06:17.160
<i>A little white house...</i>

20
00:06:17.243 --> 00:06:19.787
<i>Lingers in my memory...</i>

21
00:06:20.038 --> 00:06:22.373
<i>Of that little white house...</i>

22
00:06:22.623 --> 00:06:25.376
<i>I dream each night...</i>

23
00:06:25.626 --> 00:06:28.463
<i>The windows of that little house...</i>

24
00:06:28.671 --> 00:06:31.507
<i>Beautifully shine in the sun...</i>

25
00:06:31.758 --> 00:06:34.886
<i>As if someone's eyes...</i>

26
00:06:34.969 --> 00:06:38.598
<i>Were filling with tears...</i>

27
00:06:51.152 --> 00:06:53.654
<i>When I heard him again,
my heart beat faster,</i>


28
00:06:53.738 --> 00:06:57.200
<i>because what happened
here... was a murder.</i>


29
00:06:58.034 --> 00:07:00.912
<i>I really relived what happened.</i>

30
00:08:03.391 --> 00:08:08.563
It's hard to recognize, but it was here.

31
00:08:12.567 --> 00:08:14.610
They burned people here.

32
00:08:14.944 --> 00:08:17.613
A lot of people were burned here.

33
00:08:28.457 --> 00:08:30.877
Yes, this is the place.

34
00:09:07.455 --> 00:09:11.125
No one ever left here again.

35
00:09:18.716 --> 00:09:21.052
The gas vans came in here...

36
00:09:21.302 --> 00:09:23.930
There were two huge ovens,

37
00:09:27.141 --> 00:09:31.145
and afterward,
the bodies were thrown


38
00:09:33.397 --> 00:09:34.899
into these ovens,

39
00:09:34.982 --> 00:09:37.652
and the ﬂames reached to the sky.

40
00:09:37.902 --> 00:09:39.528
<i>To the sky?</i>

41
00:09:44.575 --> 00:09:46.702
It was terrible.

42
00:09:57.713 --> 00:09:59.840
No one can describe it.

43
00:09:59.924 --> 00:10:02.260
No one can...

44
00:10:03.511 --> 00:10:07.640
recreate what happened here.

45
00:10:09.684 --> 00:10:12.436
Impossible!
And no one can understand it.


46
00:10:13.271 --> 00:10:15.982
Even I, here, now.

47
00:10:23.864 --> 00:10:26.284
<i>I can't believe I'm here.</i>

48
00:10:29.120 --> 00:10:31.914
<i>No, I just can't believe it.</i>

49
00:10:44.135 --> 00:10:46.929
<i>It was always this peaceful here.</i>

50
00:10:48.097 --> 00:10:54.103
<i>When they burned 2,000 people...
Jews... every day,</i>


51
00:10:54.353 --> 00:10:56.439
<i>it was just as peaceful.</i>

52
00:10:58.733 --> 00:11:02.528
<i>No one shouted.
Everyone went about his work.</i>


53
00:11:02.903 --> 00:11:05.031
<i>It was silent. Peaceful.</i>

54
00:11:05.781 --> 00:11:07.825
<i>Just as it is now.</i>

55
00:11:36.687 --> 00:11:40.399
<i>You, girl, don't you cry.</i>

56
00:11:40.483 --> 00:11:43.277
<i>Don't be so sad.</i>

57
00:11:43.611 --> 00:11:46.739
<i>For the dear summer is nearing...</i>

58
00:11:47.114 --> 00:11:49.033
<i>and I'll return with it.</i>

59
00:11:49.367 --> 00:11:52.620
<i>A mug of red
wine, a slice of roast,</i>

60
00:11:52.703 --> 00:11:55.956
<i>that's what the girls
give their soldiers.</i>


61
00:12:03.297 --> 00:12:06.384
<i>When the soldiers march along,</i>

62
00:12:06.717 --> 00:12:09.970
<i>the girls open their doors and windows.</i>

63
00:12:22.233 --> 00:12:26.320
<i>They thought the Germans
made him sing on the river.</i>


64
00:12:30.533 --> 00:12:32.993
<i>He was a toy to amuse them.</i>

65
00:12:34.495 --> 00:12:36.497
<i>He had to do it.</i>

66
00:12:36.831 --> 00:12:39.291
<i>He sang, but his heart wept.</i>

67
00:12:44.046 --> 00:12:47.425
<i>Do their hearts weep
thinking about that now?</i>


68
00:12:48.676 --> 00:12:50.219
<i>Certainly, very much so.</i>

69
00:12:57.184 --> 00:13:00.438
<i>They still talk about it
around the family table.</i>


70
00:13:03.399 --> 00:13:06.152
<i>It was public, so everyone knew of it.</i>

71
00:13:11.866 --> 00:13:15.202
<i>He said that was true German irony,</i>

72
00:13:18.080 --> 00:13:20.749
<i>people were being killed,
and he had to sing.</i>


73
00:13:22.418 --> 00:13:24.545
<i>That's what I thought.</i>

74
00:13:27.548 --> 00:13:30.301
What died in him in Chelmno?

75
00:13:39.643 --> 00:13:41.145
<i>Everything died.</i>

76
00:13:41.228 --> 00:13:44.231
<i>But he's only human,
and he wants to live.</i>


77
00:13:44.315 --> 00:13:46.650
<i>So he must forget.</i>

78
00:13:47.985 --> 00:13:51.697
__ The other survivor:
MICHAEL PODCHLEBNIK - ISRAEL


79
00:14:07.963 --> 00:14:12.510
<i>He thanks God for what remains
and that he can forget.</i>


80
00:14:12.593 --> 00:14:14.637
<i>And let's not talk about that.</i>

81
00:14:17.848 --> 00:14:20.392
Does he think it's good
to talk about it?


82
00:14:27.525 --> 00:14:29.777
<i>For me it's not good.</i>

83
00:14:34.448 --> 00:14:36.951
Then why is he talking about it?

84
00:14:53.133 --> 00:14:56.262
<i>Because you're insisting on it.</i>

85
00:14:56.470 --> 00:15:01.308
<i>He was sent books on the Eichmann trial,
where he was a witness,</i>


86
00:15:01.517 --> 00:15:03.978
<i>and he didn't even read them.</i>

87
00:15:09.483 --> 00:15:12.528
He survived,
but is he really alive, or...?


88
00:15:37.636 --> 00:15:40.806
<i>At the time, he felt
as if he were dead,</i>

89
00:15:40.889 --> 00:15:43.809
<i>because he never thought he'd survive,</i>

90
00:15:44.184 --> 00:15:47.021
<i>but... he's alive.</i>

91
00:15:51.775 --> 00:15:54.320
Why does he smile all the time?

92
00:16:03.912 --> 00:16:05.914
<i>What do you want him to do... cry?</i>

93
00:16:06.248 --> 00:16:08.250
<i>Sometimes you smile, sometimes you cry.</i>

94
00:16:10.210 --> 00:16:12.838
<i>And if you're alive,
it's better to smile.</i>


95
00:16:17.384 --> 00:16:21.847
Why was she so curious about this story?

96
00:16:22.222 --> 00:16:25.559
HAN NA ZATDL

97
00:16:25.893 --> 00:16:29.980
Daughter of Motke Za'l'dl,
survivor of Vilna (Lithuania)


98
00:17:08.936 --> 00:17:10.604
<i>It's a long story.</i>

99
00:17:10.688 --> 00:17:15.275
<i>As a child,
I had little contact with my father.</i>


100
00:17:15.359 --> 00:17:18.946
<i>He went out to work,
and I didn't see much of him.</i>


101
00:17:19.029 --> 00:17:22.658
<i>Besides, he was a silent man,
he didn 7 talk to me.</i>


102
00:17:22.741 --> 00:17:27.204
<i>And when I grew up
and was strong enough to face him,</i>


103
00:17:27.287 --> 00:17:30.916
<i>I questioned him.
I never stopped questioning him</i>


104
00:17:30.999 --> 00:17:35.212
<i>until I got at the scraps of truth
he couldn't tell me.</i>


105
00:17:35.295 --> 00:17:38.757
<i>It came out haltingly.</i>

106
00:17:39.133 --> 00:17:41.218
<i>I had to tear
the details out of him,</i>

107
00:17:41.301 --> 00:17:46.849
<i>and finally, when Mr. 
Lanzmann came,</i>

108
00:17:47.182 --> 00:17:51.895
<i>I heard the whole story
for the second time.</i>

BEN SHEMEN FOREST (ISRAEL)

111
00:18:20.507 --> 00:18:24.762
<i>The place resembles Ponary:
the forest, the ditches.</i>


112
00:18:24.845 --> 00:18:27.848
<i>It's as if the bodies were burned here.</i>

113
00:18:28.056 --> 00:18:30.976
<i>Except there were no stones in Ponary.</i>

114
00:18:32.102 --> 00:18:35.898
Ponary: forest where most
of the Vilna Jews were massacred


115
00:18:36.148 --> 00:18:37.983
But the Lithuanian forests

116
00:18:38.066 --> 00:18:41.320
are denser than the Israeli forest, no?

117
00:18:46.700 --> 00:18:48.202
<i>Of course.</i>

118
00:18:54.041 --> 00:18:58.170
<i>The trees are similar,
but taller and fuller in Lithuania.</i>

FOREST OF THE EXTERMINATION CAMP
AT SOBIBOR (POLAND)


120
00:19:03.717 --> 00:19:07.221
ls there still hunting
here in Sobibor forest?


121
00:19:20.901 --> 00:19:24.988
Yes, there are lots of animals
of all kinds.


122
00:19:27.991 --> 00:19:29.493
Was there hunting then?

123
00:19:34.790 --> 00:19:38.627
Only man hunting.

124
00:19:40.254 --> 00:19:41.964
JAN PIWONSKI

125
00:19:59.398 --> 00:20:01.650
Some victims tried to escape.

126
00:20:07.698 --> 00:20:10.450
But they didn't know the area.

127
00:20:15.122 --> 00:20:19.918
At times people heard explosions
in the minefield.


128
00:20:20.002 --> 00:20:22.754
Sometimes they'd find a deer

129
00:20:22.838 --> 00:20:26.341
and sometimes a poor Jew
who tried to escape.


130
00:20:50.032 --> 00:20:53.744
<i>That's the charm of our forests:
silence and beauty.</i>


131
00:21:08.258 --> 00:21:11.553
But it wasn't always so silent here.

132
00:21:21.772 --> 00:21:26.193
There was a time
when it was full of screams


133
00:21:26.276 --> 00:21:27.778
and gunshots,

134
00:21:30.238 --> 00:21:31.740
of dogs' barking.

135
00:21:43.752 --> 00:21:46.672
And that period especially

136
00:21:46.755 --> 00:21:49.466
is engraved on the minds of the people

137
00:21:49.549 --> 00:21:52.052
who lived here then.

138
00:22:03.897 --> 00:22:09.027
After the revolt, the Germans
decided to liquidate the camp,


139
00:22:09.111 --> 00:22:11.488
and early in the winter of 1943,

140
00:22:11.571 --> 00:22:15.534
they planted pines
that were three or four years old


141
00:22:15.617 --> 00:22:17.786
to camouﬂage all the traces.

142
00:22:17.869 --> 00:22:19.371
That screen of trees?

143
00:22:19.997 --> 00:22:20.664
Yes.

144
00:22:20.747 --> 00:22:22.916
That's where the mass graves were?

145
00:22:41.018 --> 00:22:44.229
When he first came here in 1944,

146
00:22:44.312 --> 00:22:48.191
you couldn't guess
what had happened here,


147
00:22:48.275 --> 00:22:53.113
that these trees were hiding
the secret of a death camp.


148
00:22:57.159 --> 00:23:00.912
How did he react,
the first time he unloaded corpses,


149
00:23:00.996 --> 00:23:03.832
when the gas van doors were opened?

150
00:23:17.554 --> 00:23:20.140
<i>What could he do? He cried.</i>

151
00:23:28.815 --> 00:23:31.943
<i>The 3rd day,
he saw his wife and children.</i>


152
00:23:52.964 --> 00:23:56.718
<i>He placed his wife
in the grave and asked to be killed.</i>


153
00:23:56.802 --> 00:23:59.721
<i>The Germans said
he was strong enough to work,</i>


154
00:23:59.805 --> 00:24:02.224
<i>that he wouldn't be killed yet.</i>

155
00:24:19.699 --> 00:24:21.785
<i>Was the weather very cold?</i>

156
00:24:30.919 --> 00:24:36.049
<i>It was in the winter of 1942,
in early January.</i>


157
00:24:39.636 --> 00:24:43.348
<i>At that time, the bodies
weren't burned, just buried?</i>


158
00:25:10.625 --> 00:25:14.880
<i>No, they were buried,
and each row was covered with dirt.</i>


159
00:25:14.963 --> 00:25:17.007
<i>They weren't being burned yet.</i>

160
00:25:17.090 --> 00:25:19.384
<i>There were around four or five layers.</i>

161
00:25:19.467 --> 00:25:22.304
<i>The ditches were funnel-shaped.</i>

162
00:25:31.146 --> 00:25:34.399
<i>They dumped the bodies
in these ditches,</i>


163
00:25:34.482 --> 00:25:38.570
<i>and they had to lay them out
like herrings, head to foot.</i>


164
00:25:49.080 --> 00:25:54.127
<i>So it was they who dug up
and burned all the Jews of Vilna?</i>


165
00:25:55.337 --> 00:25:56.546
<i>Yes.</i>

166
00:26:01.259 --> 00:26:04.888
<i>In early January 1944,
we began digging up the bodies.</i>


167
00:26:16.983 --> 00:26:19.819
<i>When the last mass grave was opened,</i>

168
00:26:20.320 --> 00:26:22.572
<i>I recognized my whole family.</i>

169
00:26:25.617 --> 00:26:28.662
Whom in his family did he recognize?

170
00:26:40.173 --> 00:26:43.385
<i>Mom and my sisters.

171
00:26:43.468 --> 00:26:45.720
<i>They were all in there.</i>

172
00:26:46.221 --> 00:26:48.556
How could he recognize them?

173
00:26:50.850 --> 00:26:53.395
ITZHAK DUGIN:
Survivor of Vilna


174
00:27:15.667 --> 00:27:18.503
<i>They'd been in the earth 4 months,</i>

175
00:27:18.586 --> 00:27:20.964
<i>and it was winter.</i>

176
00:27:21.047 --> 00:27:22.882
<i>They were very well preserved.</i>

177
00:27:22.966 --> 00:27:26.761
<i>I recognized their faces,
their clothes too.</i>


178
00:27:27.929 --> 00:27:31.057
They'd been killed relatively recently?

179
00:27:41.109 --> 00:27:43.194
And it was the last grave?

180
00:27:50.201 --> 00:27:54.080
The Nazi plan was for them
to open the graves


181
00:27:54.164 --> 00:27:55.874
starting with the oldest?

182
00:28:41.127 --> 00:28:44.130
<i>The last graves were the newest,</i>

183
00:28:44.214 --> 00:28:48.927
<i>and we started with the oldest,
those of the first ghetto.</i>


184
00:28:49.010 --> 00:28:51.971
<i>In the first grave,
there were 24,000 bodies.</i>


185
00:29:04.401 --> 00:29:08.530
<i>The deeper you dug,
the ﬂatter the bodies were.</i>


186
00:29:08.613 --> 00:29:11.282
<i>Each was almost a ﬂat slab.</i>

187
00:29:15.578 --> 00:29:19.332
<i>When you tried to grasp a body,
it crumbled,</i>


188
00:29:19.416 --> 00:29:21.668
<i>it was impossible to pick them up.</i>

189
00:29:29.968 --> 00:29:34.389
<i>We had to open the graves,
but without tools.</i>


190
00:29:34.472 --> 00:29:38.226
<i>They said, “Get used to working
with your hands.”</i>


191
00:29:38.309 --> 00:29:40.895
With just their hands?

192
00:30:04.669 --> 00:30:06.921
<i>When we first opened the graves,</i>

193
00:30:07.005 --> 00:30:10.467
<i>we couldn't help it,
we all burst out sobbing.</i>


194
00:30:10.550 --> 00:30:15.305
<i>But the Germans almost beat us to death.</i>

195
00:30:15.388 --> 00:30:19.184
<i>We had to work
at a killing pace for two days,</i>


196
00:30:19.267 --> 00:30:22.020
<i>beaten all the time, and with no tools.</i>

197
00:30:23.730 --> 00:30:25.940
They all burst out sobbing?

198
00:30:48.588 --> 00:30:51.049
<i>The Germans even forbade us</i>

199
00:30:51.132 --> 00:30:54.677
<i>to use the words
“corpse</i> ” <i>or “victim.</i> ”

200
00:30:54.761 --> 00:30:58.473
<i>The dead were blocks of wood, shit,</i>

201
00:30:58.556 --> 00:31:01.601
<i>with absolutely no importance...</i>

202
00:31:08.650 --> 00:31:12.278
<i>Anyone who said “corpse”
or “victim” was beaten.</i>


203
00:31:18.535 --> 00:31:23.623
<i>The Germans made us
refer to the bodies as “F (guren,</i> ”


204
00:31:23.706 --> 00:31:26.543
<i>that is, as puppets, as dolls,</i>

205
00:31:27.794 --> 00:31:29.921
<i>or as “Schmattes,”
which means “rags.”</i>


206
00:31:32.674 --> 00:31:34.717
<i>Were they told at the start</i>

207
00:31:34.801 --> 00:31:38.429
<i>how many “Figuren”
there were in all the graves?</i>


208
00:31:53.528 --> 00:31:56.489
<i>The head of the Vilna Gestapo told us,</i>

209
00:31:56.573 --> 00:32:00.201
<i>“There are 90,000 people lying there,</i>

210
00:32:00.285 --> 00:32:03.329
<i>and absolutely no trace
must be left of them.”</i>


211
00:32:10.378 --> 00:32:14.257
It was at the end of November 1942.

212
00:32:17.510 --> 00:32:21.055
They chased us away from our work

213
00:32:22.557 --> 00:32:25.351
and back to our barracks.

214
00:32:25.435 --> 00:32:27.353
Suddenly,

215
00:32:28.896 --> 00:32:36.321
from the part of the camp called

216
00:32:37.447 --> 00:32:42.076
the death camp,

217
00:32:44.203 --> 00:32:46.372
ﬂames shot up very high.

218
00:32:50.418 --> 00:32:54.297
In a ﬂash, the whole countryside,

219
00:32:54.380 --> 00:32:58.217
the whole camp seemed ablaze.

220
00:33:00.928 --> 00:33:02.847
It was already dark.

221
00:33:07.769 --> 00:33:10.104
We went into our barracks

222
00:33:11.856 --> 00:33:13.941
and ate...

223
00:33:14.442 --> 00:33:19.322
And from the window,

224
00:33:19.572 --> 00:33:25.411
we kept on watching
the fantastic backdrop of ﬂames


225
00:33:25.495 --> 00:33:27.997
of every imaginable color,

226
00:33:29.248 --> 00:33:32.877
red, yellow, green, purple.

227
00:33:33.086 --> 00:33:41.302
And suddenly one of us stood up.

228
00:33:42.095 --> 00:33:48.309
We knew he'd been
an opera singer in Warsaw.


229
00:33:50.269 --> 00:33:54.649
His name was Salve, and...

230
00:33:59.153 --> 00:34:03.116
facing that curtain of fire,

231
00:34:03.199 --> 00:34:07.453
he began chanting a song

232
00:34:07.537 --> 00:34:11.040
I didn't know:

233
00:34:11.916 --> 00:34:13.710
“My God, my God,

234
00:34:15.461 --> 00:34:17.964
why hast Thou forsaken us?”

235
00:34:18.381 --> 00:34:22.468
RICHARD GLAZAR -
BASEL (SWITZERLAND)


236
00:34:24.470 --> 00:34:29.058
<i>“We have been thrust
into the fire before,</i>


237
00:34:29.475 --> 00:34:34.981
<i>but we he ve ne ver denied
Thy Holy L a w. ”</i>


238
00:34:36.733 --> 00:34:40.361
<i>He sang in Yiddish,</i>

239
00:34:40.445 --> 00:34:42.822
<i>while, behind him,</i>

240
00:34:42.905 --> 00:34:47.952
<i>blazed the pyres</i>

241
00:34:48.661 --> 00:34:55.042
<i>on which they had begun
then, in November 1942,</i>


242
00:34:55.126 --> 00:34:58.254
<i>to burn the bodies in Treblinka.</i>

243
00:34:59.964 --> 00:35:04.969
<i>That was the first time it happened.</i>

244
00:35:06.512 --> 00:35:08.473
<i>We knew that night</i>

245
00:35:08.556 --> 00:35:12.769
<i>that the dead would no longer be buried,</i>

246
00:35:14.270 --> 00:35:16.272
<i>they'd be burned.</i>

247
00:35:16.773 --> 00:35:19.442
TREBLINKA

248
00:35:45.843 --> 00:35:50.556
<i>When things were ready,
they poured on fuel</i>


249
00:35:50.640 --> 00:35:52.558
<i>and touched off the fire.</i>

250
00:35:52.809 --> 00:35:55.186
<i>They waited for a high wind.</i>

251
00:35:55.269 --> 00:35:59.190
<i>The pyres usually burned
for 7 or 8 days.</i>


252
00:36:06.656 --> 00:36:10.868
<i>There was a concrete platform
some distance away,</i>


253
00:36:12.078 --> 00:36:15.122
<i>and the bones that hadn't burned,</i>

254
00:36:15.206 --> 00:36:17.875
<i>the big bones of the feet, for example,</i>

255
00:36:17.959 --> 00:36:20.378
<i>we took...</i>

256
00:36:21.546 --> 00:36:25.091
<i>There was a chest with two handles.</i>

257
00:36:25.174 --> 00:36:28.177
<i>We carried the bones there,</i>

258
00:36:28.261 --> 00:36:34.475
where others had to crush them.

259
00:36:34.559 --> 00:36:37.311
It was very fine,

260
00:36:38.563 --> 00:36:41.399
that powdered bone.

261
00:36:41.482 --> 00:36:44.735
Then it was put into sacks,

262
00:36:45.570 --> 00:36:49.782
and when there were enough sacks,

263
00:36:49.866 --> 00:36:54.662
we went to a
bridge on the Narew river

264
00:36:54.954 --> 00:36:57.498
and dumped the powder.

265
00:36:57.582 --> 00:36:59.375
The current carried it off.

266
00:37:01.794 --> 00:37:04.255
<i>It drifted downstream.</i>

267
00:38:38.432 --> 00:38:42.520
PAULA BIREN - CINCINNATI U.S.A.

THE JEWISH CEMETERY
IN LODZ TODAY


269
00:39:25.938 --> 00:39:28.274
AUSCHWITZ: THE TOWN

270
00:39:29.150 --> 00:39:32.820
<i>Mrs. Pietryra, you live in Auschwitz?</i>

271
00:39:36.574 --> 00:39:38.159
<i>Yes, I was born here.</i>

272
00:39:38.242 --> 00:39:40.494
<i>And you've never left Auschwitz?</i>

273
00:39:42.621 --> 00:39:44.248
<i>No, never.</i>

274
00:39:44.331 --> 00:39:47.293
<i>Were there Jews in Auschwitz
before the war?</i>


275
00:39:52.965 --> 00:39:55.551
<i>They made up 80% of the population.</i>

276
00:39:59.805 --> 00:40:01.974
They even had a synagogue here.

277
00:40:02.058 --> 00:40:03.059
Just one?

278
00:40:05.978 --> 00:40:06.937
Just one, I think.

279
00:40:07.021 --> 00:40:08.522
Does it still exist?

280
00:40:13.110 --> 00:40:15.071
No, it was wrecked.

281
00:40:15.154 --> 00:40:17.615
There's something else there now.

282
00:40:17.698 --> 00:40:20.117
Was there a Jewish cemetery
in Auschwitz?


283
00:40:26.540 --> 00:40:30.419
It still exists. it's closed now.

284
00:40:30.503 --> 00:40:32.797
- It still exists?
- Yes.


285
00:40:37.510 --> 00:40:39.303
<i>Closed? What does that mean?</i>

286
00:40:42.473 --> 00:40:44.975
<i>They don't bury there now.</i>

287
00:41:05.162 --> 00:41:07.373
<i>Was there a synagogue in Wlodawa?</i>

288
00:41:10.835 --> 00:41:13.337
Yes, and it's very beautiful.

289
00:41:18.175 --> 00:41:21.137
When Poland was ruled by the czars,

290
00:41:21.220 --> 00:41:23.806
that synagogue already existed.

291
00:41:26.475 --> 00:41:30.146
It's even older than the Catholic church.

292
00:42:00.843 --> 00:42:02.428
<i>It's no longer used.</i>

293
00:42:04.597 --> 00:42:06.557
<i>There's no one to go to it.</i>

294
00:42:13.939 --> 00:42:17.526
These buildings haven't changed?

295
00:42:22.781 --> 00:42:26.327
Not at all.
There were barrels of herrings here,


296
00:42:26.410 --> 00:42:28.120
and the Jews sold fish.

297
00:42:29.997 --> 00:42:32.875
There were stalls, small shops,

298
00:42:32.958 --> 00:42:35.920
Jewish business, as the gentleman says.

299
00:42:39.965 --> 00:42:41.634
That's Barenholz's house.

300
00:42:43.302 --> 00:42:45.137
He sold wood.

301
00:42:50.809 --> 00:42:53.854
Lipschitz's store was there.
He sold cloth.


302
00:42:54.897 --> 00:42:56.774
This was Lichtenstein's.

303
00:42:56.857 --> 00:42:58.859
What was there, opposite?

304
00:43:01.612 --> 00:43:03.739
A food store.

305
00:43:03.822 --> 00:43:05.658
A Jewish store?

306
00:43:09.787 --> 00:43:12.081
There was a notions shop here,

307
00:43:12.164 --> 00:43:15.834
it sold thread, needles, odds and ends,

308
00:43:19.171 --> 00:43:21.674
and there were also three barbers.

309
00:43:22.841 --> 00:43:25.261
PAN FILIPOWICZ

310
00:43:26.178 --> 00:43:29.598
- Was that fine house Jewish?
- It's Jewish.


311
00:43:29.682 --> 00:43:32.685
- And this small one?
- Also.


312
00:43:32.768 --> 00:43:34.270
And the one behind it?

313
00:43:35.479 --> 00:43:36.939
These were all Jewish.

314
00:43:37.022 --> 00:43:38.774
This one on the left, too?

315
00:43:41.026 --> 00:43:42.027
That one too.

316
00:43:44.071 --> 00:43:46.031
Who lived in it? Borenstein?

317
00:43:48.409 --> 00:43:51.620
He was in the cement business.

318
00:43:51.704 --> 00:43:54.248
He was very handsome, and cultivated.

319
00:43:58.168 --> 00:44:01.380
Here there was a blacksmith
named Tepper.


320
00:44:01.880 --> 00:44:03.549
It was a Jewish house.

321
00:44:04.675 --> 00:44:06.552
A shoemaker lived here.

322
00:44:06.635 --> 00:44:08.721
What was his name?

323
00:44:10.055 --> 00:44:12.141
- Yankel?
- Yes.


324
00:44:12.558 --> 00:44:16.061
You get the feeling Wlodawa
was a Jewish city.


325
00:44:20.607 --> 00:44:22.192
Yes, because it's true.

326
00:44:23.068 --> 00:44:27.072
The Poles lived farther out,
the center was wholly Jewish.


327
00:44:28.949 --> 00:44:31.327
<i>What happened to the Jews of Auschwitz?</i>

328
00:44:37.541 --> 00:44:40.669
<i>They were expelled and resettled,</i>

329
00:44:40.753 --> 00:44:42.838
<i>but I don't know where.</i>

330
00:44:42.921 --> 00:44:44.757
<i>What year was that?</i>

331
00:44:48.302 --> 00:44:53.515
<i>It began in 1940,
which was when I moved here.</i>


332
00:44:53.599 --> 00:44:56.060
<i>This apartment also belonged to Jews.</i>

333
00:44:56.894 --> 00:45:00.522
According to our information,

334
00:45:00.606 --> 00:45:05.027
the Auschwitz Jews
were “resettled,” as they say,


335
00:45:05.110 --> 00:45:09.531
nearby, in Benzin
and Sosnowiec, in Upper Silesia.


336
00:45:11.992 --> 00:45:14.661
Yes, because those were Jewish towns.

337
00:45:14.745 --> 00:45:19.541
Does she know what happened
to the Jews of Auschwitz?


338
00:45:25.089 --> 00:45:28.092
I think they all
ended up in the camp.

339
00:45:28.175 --> 00:45:30.219
That is, they returned to Auschwitz?

340
00:45:35.432 --> 00:45:39.478
AUSCHWITZ 
- BIRKENAU

341
00:45:52.366 --> 00:45:57.704
<i>All kinds of people from everywhere
were sent here.</i>


342
00:45:58.872 --> 00:46:01.667
<i>All the Jews came here... to die.</i>

343
00:46:10.050 --> 00:46:14.721
What did they think when Wlodawa's
Jews were all deported to Sobibor?


344
00:46:15.514 --> 00:46:19.601
Wlodawa 
- Sobibor: 10 miles

345
00:46:28.527 --> 00:46:30.779
What could we think?

346
00:46:30.863 --> 00:46:36.743
That it was the end of them,
but they had foreseen that.


347
00:46:36.827 --> 00:46:38.370
How so?

348
00:46:54.845 --> 00:46:58.015
Even before the war,
when you talked to the Jews,


349
00:46:58.098 --> 00:46:59.933
they foresaw their doom.

350
00:47:00.017 --> 00:47:01.477
He doesn't know how.

351
00:47:01.560 --> 00:47:04.396
Even before the war,
they had a premonition.


352
00:47:14.698 --> 00:47:17.242
<i>How were they taken to Sobibor? On foot?</i>

353
00:47:23.790 --> 00:47:26.627
<i>It was frightful. 
He watched it himself.</i>

354
00:47:30.422 --> 00:47:34.760
<i>They were herded on foot
to a station called Orkrobek.</i>


355
00:47:43.727 --> 00:47:49.775
<i>There, they put the old people first
into waiting cattle cars,</i>


356
00:47:52.945 --> 00:47:55.030
<i>then the younger Jews,</i>

357
00:47:58.784 --> 00:48:01.036
<i>and finally the kids.</i>

358
00:48:01.119 --> 00:48:05.832
<i>That was the worst:
They threw them on top of the others.</i>


359
00:48:42.995 --> 00:48:45.080
<i>Were there a lot of Jews in Kolo?</i>

360
00:48:48.542 --> 00:48:49.876
<i>A great many.</i>

361
00:48:51.461 --> 00:48:53.505
<i>More Jews than Poles.</i>

362
00:48:54.506 --> 00:48:57.509
<i>And what happened to the Kolo Jews?</i>

363
00:48:57.593 --> 00:48:59.511
<i>Was he an eyewitness?</i>

364
00:49:00.637 --> 00:49:04.057
PAN FALBORSKI

365
00:49:05.183 --> 00:49:07.394
Yes. It was frightful.

366
00:49:23.994 --> 00:49:25.162
Frightful to see.

367
00:49:25.245 --> 00:49:28.123
Even the Germans hid,
they couldn't see that.


368
00:49:28.206 --> 00:49:32.628
When the Jews were herded
to the station, they were beaten,


369
00:49:32.711 --> 00:49:34.171
some were even killed.

370
00:49:34.254 --> 00:49:39.801
A cart followed the convoy
to pick up the corpses.


371
00:49:40.218 --> 00:49:44.890
- Those who couldn't walk, the slain?
- Yes, those who'd fallen.


372
00:49:44.973 --> 00:49:47.059
Where did this happen?

373
00:50:07.579 --> 00:50:12.167
The Jews were collected
in the Kolo synagogue.


374
00:50:12.250 --> 00:50:15.504
Then they were herded to the station,

375
00:50:15.587 --> 00:50:19.633
where the narrow-gauge rail road
went to Chelmno.


376
00:50:28.058 --> 00:50:32.104
<i>It happened to all the Jews
in the area, not just in Kolo?</i>


377
00:50:39.611 --> 00:50:41.113
<i>Absolutely.</i>

378
00:50:41.947 --> 00:50:43.490
<i>Everywhere.</i>

379
00:50:48.078 --> 00:50:50.706
<i>Jews were also murdered
in the forests</i>


380
00:50:50.789 --> 00:50:53.291
<i>near Kalisz, not far from here.</i>

381
00:53:20.605 --> 00:53:24.693
ABRAHAM BOMBA - TEL AVIV, ISRAEL,
survivor of Treblinka


382
00:53:53.179 --> 00:53:57.225
TREBLINKA BY ROAD

383
00:55:54.217 --> 00:55:55.719
<i>He was born here</i>

384
00:55:57.303 --> 00:55:58.930
<i>in 1923</i>

385
00:55:59.556 --> 00:56:01.474
<i>and has been here even since.</i>

386
00:56:03.810 --> 00:56:05.687
<i>He lived at this very spot?</i>

387
00:56:05.979 --> 00:56:07.480
<i>Right here.</i>

388
00:56:07.564 --> 00:56:11.234
<i>Then he had a front-row seat
for what happened.</i>


389
00:56:17.115 --> 00:56:18.616
<i>Naturally.</i>

390
00:56:21.327 --> 00:56:26.041
<i>You could go up close
or watch from a distance.</i>


391
00:56:27.000 --> 00:56:30.045
CZESLAW BOROWI

392
00:56:33.923 --> 00:56:36.926
They had land
on the far side of the station.


393
00:56:37.010 --> 00:56:40.388
To work it, he
had to cross the track,

394
00:56:40.472 --> 00:56:42.474
so he could see everything.

395
00:56:47.645 --> 00:56:52.567
<i>Does he remember
the first convoy of Jews from Warsaw</i>


396
00:56:52.650 --> 00:56:55.278
<i>on July 22, 1942?</i>

397
00:56:58.782 --> 00:56:59.908
<i>Yes.</i>

398
00:57:03.828 --> 00:57:06.331
<i>He recalls the first convoy very well,</i>

399
00:57:07.874 --> 00:57:10.752
<i>and when all those Jews
were brought here,</i>


400
00:57:15.340 --> 00:57:19.344
<i>people wondered,
“What's to be done with them?”</i>


401
00:57:21.930 --> 00:57:26.017
<i>Clearly, they'd be killed,
but no one yet knew how.</i>


402
00:57:38.071 --> 00:57:42.534
When people began
to understand what was happening,


403
00:57:43.076 --> 00:57:44.577
they were appalled,

404
00:57:44.661 --> 00:57:49.833
and they commented privately
that since the world began,


405
00:57:49.916 --> 00:57:53.545
no one had ever murdered
so many people that way.


406
00:57:59.050 --> 00:58:02.470
<i>While all this was happening
before their eyes,</i>


407
00:58:02.554 --> 00:58:04.055
<i>normal life went on?</i>

408
00:58:04.139 --> 00:58:05.849
<i>They worked their fields?</i>

409
00:58:29.289 --> 00:58:31.082
Certainly they worked,

410
00:58:31.166 --> 00:58:35.920
but not as willingly as usual.

411
00:58:36.588 --> 00:58:38.506
<i>They had to work,</i>

412
00:58:38.590 --> 00:58:41.176
<i>but when they saw all this,
they thought,</i>


413
00:58:41.259 --> 00:58:44.679
<i>“What if our house is surrounded
and we're arrested?”</i>


414
00:58:47.432 --> 00:58:49.767
Were they afraid for the Jews, too?

415
00:59:21.799 --> 00:59:23.718
Well, he says it's this way:

416
00:59:23.801 --> 00:59:28.389
If I cut my
finger, it doesn't hurt him.

417
00:59:28.473 --> 00:59:30.808
They saw what happened to the Jews:

418
00:59:30.892 --> 00:59:35.521
The convoy came in
and then went to the camp,


419
00:59:36.272 --> 00:59:38.566
and the people vanished.

420
00:59:40.985 --> 00:59:46.324
He had a field
less than 100 yards from the camp.


421
00:59:47.992 --> 00:59:50.787
He also worked
during the German occupation.


422
00:59:50.870 --> 00:59:53.289
- He worked his field?
- Yes.


423
00:59:54.999 --> 00:59:58.503
He saw how they were asphyxiated,

424
00:59:58.586 --> 01:00:01.923
he heard them scream, he saw that.

425
01:00:02.006 --> 01:00:06.511
There's a small hill:
He could see quite a bit.


426
01:00:08.846 --> 01:00:10.515
What did he say?

427
01:00:14.560 --> 01:00:17.272
They couldn't stop and watch.

428
01:00:17.772 --> 01:00:20.775
It was forbidden.
The Ukrainians shot at them.


429
01:00:20.858 --> 01:00:25.697
But they could work a field

430
01:00:26.864 --> 01:00:29.909
They could.

431
01:00:31.160 --> 01:00:33.329
So occasionally he could steal a glance,

432
01:00:33.413 --> 01:00:35.665
if the Ukrainians weren't looking.

433
01:00:35.748 --> 01:00:37.792
He worked with his eyes lowered?

434
01:00:41.421 --> 01:00:42.714
Yes.

435
01:00:47.218 --> 01:00:51.055
He worked by the barbed wire
and heard awful screams.


436
01:00:51.139 --> 01:00:52.932
His field was there?

437
01:00:55.018 --> 01:00:56.894
Yes, right up close.

438
01:00:58.062 --> 01:01:00.481
It wasn't forbidden to work there.

439
01:01:01.441 --> 01:01:03.234
So he worked, he farmed there?

440
01:01:08.531 --> 01:01:09.782
Yes.

441
01:01:10.742 --> 01:01:14.954
Where the camp is now
was partly his field.


442
01:01:27.091 --> 01:01:30.011
It was off limits,
but they heard everything.


443
01:01:30.094 --> 01:01:33.348
It didn't bother him to work
so near those screams?


444
01:01:42.440 --> 01:01:45.985
At first it was unbearable.
Then you got used to it.


445
01:01:46.444 --> 01:01:48.279
You get used to anything?

446
01:01:52.116 --> 01:01:53.409
Yes.

447
01:01:56.496 --> 01:02:00.208
Now he thinks... it's impossible.

448
01:02:00.291 --> 01:02:01.959
Yet it was true.

449
01:02:30.822 --> 01:02:33.658
So he saw the convoys arriving.

450
01:02:34.158 --> 01:02:38.371
There were 60 to 80 cars
in each convoy,


451
01:02:38.663 --> 01:02:41.499
and there were two locomotives

452
01:02:41.582 --> 01:02:45.420
that took the convoys into the camp,

453
01:02:45.503 --> 01:02:49.465
taking 20 cars at a time.

454
01:02:50.341 --> 01:02:52.844
And the cars came back empty?

455
01:02:55.471 --> 01:02:57.682
- Yes.
- Does he remember...?


456
01:03:02.854 --> 01:03:04.397
Here's how it happened:

457
01:03:04.689 --> 01:03:07.191
The locomotive picked up 20 cars

458
01:03:08.901 --> 01:03:10.862
and took them to the camp.

459
01:03:11.195 --> 01:03:14.699
That took maybe an hour,

460
01:03:20.621 --> 01:03:22.707
and the empty cars came back here.

461
01:03:22.790 --> 01:03:24.917
Then the next 20 cars were taken,

462
01:03:25.001 --> 01:03:29.547
and meanwhile, the people
in the first 20 were already dead.


463
01:03:43.186 --> 01:03:45.062
<i>They waited, they wept,</i>

464
01:03:46.397 --> 01:03:49.233
<i>they asked for water, they died.</i>

465
01:03:51.277 --> 01:03:57.366
<i>Sometimes they were naked
in the cars, up to 170 people.</i>


466
01:03:59.911 --> 01:04:02.330
<i>This is where they gave
the Jews water, he says.</i>


467
01:04:02.413 --> 01:04:04.415
<i>Where was that?</i>

468
01:04:06.167 --> 01:04:10.671
Here. When the convoys arrived,
they gave water to the Jews.


469
01:04:10.755 --> 01:04:12.590
Who gave the Jews water?

470
01:04:14.759 --> 01:04:16.761
We did, the Poles.

471
01:04:18.012 --> 01:04:22.183
There was a tiny well,
we took a bottle and...


472
01:04:22.266 --> 01:04:24.644
Wasn't it dangerous to give them water?

473
01:04:26.938 --> 01:04:28.564
Very dangerous.

474
01:04:33.194 --> 01:04:38.366
You could be killed
for giving a glass of water.


475
01:04:38.449 --> 01:04:41.410
But we gave them water anyway.

476
01:04:46.123 --> 01:04:48.292
<i>Is it very cold here in winter?</i>

477
01:04:51.504 --> 01:04:52.838
<i>It depends.</i>

478
01:04:55.591 --> 01:04:58.094
<i>It can get to minus 15, minus 20.</i>

479
01:05:01.305 --> 01:05:04.725
<i>Which was harder on the Jews,
summer or winter?</i>


480
01:05:04.809 --> 01:05:06.602
<i>Waiting here, I mean.</i>

481
01:05:16.153 --> 01:05:19.198
<i>He thinks winter,
because they were very cold.</i>


482
01:05:23.744 --> 01:05:28.457
<i>They were so packed in the cars,
maybe they weren't cold.</i>


483
01:05:30.960 --> 01:05:34.171
<i>In summer they stiﬂed: It was very hot.</i>

484
01:05:35.172 --> 01:05:38.175
<i>The Jews were very thirsty.
They tried to get out.</i>


485
01:05:42.680 --> 01:05:46.017
Were there corpses
in the cars on arrival?


486
01:05:52.940 --> 01:05:54.442
Obviously.

487
01:06:08.122 --> 01:06:09.624
They were so packed in

488
01:06:09.707 --> 01:06:14.211
that even those still alive
sat on corpses for lack of space.


489
01:06:17.214 --> 01:06:20.426
Didn't people here
who went by the trains


490
01:06:20.509 --> 01:06:23.220
look through the cracks in the cars?

491
01:06:32.563 --> 01:06:36.067
Yes, they could look in sometimes
as they went by.


492
01:06:39.862 --> 01:06:43.908
When they were allowed,
they gave them water, too.


493
01:06:44.283 --> 01:06:46.452
How did the Jews try to get out?

494
01:06:46.535 --> 01:06:49.038
The doors weren't opened.
How'd they get out?


495
01:06:53.292 --> 01:06:55.086
Through the windows.

496
01:06:58.047 --> 01:06:59.674
They removed the barbed wire

497
01:07:01.759 --> 01:07:03.469
and came out of the windows.

498
01:07:03.552 --> 01:07:05.137
They jumped, of course.

499
01:07:10.768 --> 01:07:15.481
Sometimes they just deliberately
sat down on the ground,


500
01:07:15.981 --> 01:07:20.611
and the guards came
and shot them in the head.


501
01:07:31.288 --> 01:07:35.292
Theyjumped from the cars...
What a sight!


502
01:07:36.335 --> 01:07:38.129
Jumping from the windows.

503
01:07:40.131 --> 01:07:43.092
There was a mother and child.

504
01:07:43.175 --> 01:07:45.344
- Jewish?
- Yes.


505
01:07:45.428 --> 01:07:47.179
She tried to run away,

506
01:07:47.638 --> 01:07:51.183
and they shot her in the heart.

507
01:07:54.770 --> 01:07:57.481
- Shot who... the mother?
- Yes, the mother.


508
01:07:59.942 --> 01:08:04.488
This gentleman has lived here
a long time, he can't forget.


509
01:08:15.666 --> 01:08:18.878
He says that now he can't understand

510
01:08:18.961 --> 01:08:23.507
how a man can do that
to another human being.


511
01:08:24.341 --> 01:08:26.552
It's inconceivable,
beyond understanding.


512
01:08:29.013 --> 01:08:32.349
Once when the Jews asked for water,
a Ukrainian went by


513
01:08:33.350 --> 01:08:35.352
and forbade giving any.

514
01:08:38.272 --> 01:08:41.609
The Jewish woman
that had asked for water...


515
01:08:41.692 --> 01:08:47.031
threw her pot at his head.

516
01:08:55.998 --> 01:09:00.127
The Ukrainian moved back,

517
01:09:00.920 --> 01:09:05.508
maybe ten yards,
and opened fire on the car.


518
01:09:06.717 --> 01:09:09.553
<i>Blood and brains
were all over the place.</i>


519
01:09:12.973 --> 01:09:15.518
<i>Lots of people opened the doors</i>

520
01:09:18.395 --> 01:09:20.606
<i>or escaped through the windows.</i>

521
01:09:23.859 --> 01:09:29.490
<i>Sometimes the Ukrainians
fired through the car walls.</i>


522
01:10:02.273 --> 01:10:03.774
It happened chieﬂy at night.

523
01:10:03.858 --> 01:10:08.112
When the Jews talked to each other,
as he showed us,


524
01:10:08.195 --> 01:10:12.533
the Ukrainians wanted things quiet,

525
01:10:12.616 --> 01:10:15.911
and they asked...
yes, asked them to shut up.


526
01:10:15.995 --> 01:10:20.541
So the Jews shut up
and the guard moved off.


527
01:10:20.624 --> 01:10:24.378
Then the Jews started talking again,
in their language,


528
01:10:24.461 --> 01:10:26.338
as he says, ra-ra-ra, and so on.

529
01:10:26.422 --> 01:10:30.885
What's he mean, la-la-la?
What's he trying to imitate?


530
01:10:30.968 --> 01:10:33.304
- Their language.
- No, ask him.


531
01:10:37.474 --> 01:10:39.852
Was the Jews' noise something special?

532
01:10:40.978 --> 01:10:42.730
They spoke Jew.

533
01:10:44.398 --> 01:10:46.442
Does Mr. Borowi understand “Jew”?

534
01:10:47.985 --> 01:10:49.236
No.

535
01:12:32.965 --> 01:12:36.677
<i>Did he hear screams
behind his locomotive?</i>


536
01:12:43.726 --> 01:12:48.313
<i>Obviously, since the locomotive
was next to the camp.</i>


537
01:12:48.397 --> 01:12:50.941
<i>They screamed, asked for water.</i>

538
01:12:58.449 --> 01:13:03.203
<i>The screams from the cars
closest to the locomotive</i>


539
01:13:03.287 --> 01:13:05.914
<i>could be heard very well.</i>

540
01:13:09.877 --> 01:13:11.795
<i>Can one get used to that?</i>

541
01:13:18.302 --> 01:13:19.344
No.

542
01:13:23.474 --> 01:13:26.310
<i>It was extremely distressing to him.</i>

543
01:13:26.393 --> 01:13:31.648
<i>He knew that the people behind him
were human, like him.</i>


544
01:13:38.238 --> 01:13:44.912
<i>The Germans gave him
and the other workers vodka to drink.</i>


545
01:13:44.995 --> 01:13:47.873
<i>Without drinking,
they couldn't have done it.</i>


546
01:13:54.338 --> 01:13:56.173
<i>There was a bonus</i>

547
01:14:00.803 --> 01:14:04.890
<i>that they were paid
not in money, but in liquor.</i>


548
01:14:07.768 --> 01:14:11.522
<i>Those who worked on other trains
didn't get this bonus.</i>


549
01:14:14.983 --> 01:14:18.362
HENRIK GAWKOWSKI

550
01:14:25.202 --> 01:14:28.455
He drank every drop he got

551
01:14:28.539 --> 01:14:33.460
because without liquor
he couldn't stand the stench


552
01:14:33.544 --> 01:14:35.504
when he got here.

553
01:14:35.587 --> 01:14:39.967
They even bought more liquor
on their own


554
01:14:40.217 --> 01:14:42.219
to get drunk on.

555
01:15:50.787 --> 01:15:55.417
From the station
to the unloading ramp in the camp,


556
01:15:55.500 --> 01:15:57.836
how many miles?

557
01:16:10.599 --> 01:16:11.600
Foun

558
01:17:23.046 --> 01:17:25.090
AB RAHAM BC) M BA

559
01:17:49.156 --> 01:17:51.074
<i>We traveled for two days.</i>

560
01:17:53.035 --> 01:17:55.370
<i>On the morning of the second day</i>

561
01:17:55.454 --> 01:18:00.042
<i>we saw that
we had left Czechoslovakia</i>


562
01:18:00.125 --> 01:18:04.796
<i>and were heading east.</i>

563
01:18:09.593 --> 01:18:13.221
<i>It wasn't the SS guarding us,</i>

564
01:18:13.597 --> 01:18:17.642
<i>but the Schutzpolizei,</i>

565
01:18:17.726 --> 01:18:20.437
<i>the police, in green uniforms.</i>

566
01:18:23.607 --> 01:18:26.860
<i>We were in ordinary passenger cars.</i>

567
01:18:26.943 --> 01:18:28.945
<i>All the seats were filled.</i>

568
01:18:30.155 --> 01:18:32.491
<i>You couldn't choose.</i>

569
01:18:32.574 --> 01:18:35.327
<i>They were all numbered and assigned.</i>

570
01:18:37.371 --> 01:18:41.708
<i>In my compartment
there was an elderly couple.</i>


571
01:18:41.792 --> 01:18:43.585
<i>I still remember:</i>

572
01:18:43.668 --> 01:18:49.591
<i>The good man was always hungry
and his wife scolded him,</i>


573
01:18:49.674 --> 01:18:56.264
<i>saying they'd have no food left
for the future.</i>


574
01:19:00.143 --> 01:19:02.145
RICHARD GLAZAR

575
01:19:02.896 --> 01:19:06.066
<i>Then, on the second day,</i>

576
01:19:06.316 --> 01:19:09.403
<i>I saw a sign for Malkinia.</i>

577
01:19:09.820 --> 01:19:11.988
<i>We went on a little farther.</i>

578
01:19:12.489 --> 01:19:17.411
<i>Then, very slowly,</i>

579
01:19:17.494 --> 01:19:21.415
<i>the train turned off the main track</i>

580
01:19:21.498 --> 01:19:25.836
<i>and rolled at a walking pace
through a wood.</i>


581
01:19:25.919 --> 01:19:28.797
<i>While he looked out,</i>

582
01:19:29.673 --> 01:19:32.384
<i>we'd been able to open a window.</i>

583
01:19:32.467 --> 01:19:36.430
<i>The old man
in our compartment saw a boy...</i>


584
01:19:36.513 --> 01:19:40.058
<i>Cows were grazing...</i>

585
01:19:40.308 --> 01:19:44.146
<i>And he asked the boy in signs,</i>

586
01:19:44.229 --> 01:19:46.606
<i>“Where are we?”</i>

587
01:19:47.524 --> 01:19:50.527
And the kid made a funny gesture. This!

588
01:19:51.445 --> 01:19:53.155
Across the throat.

589
01:19:55.740 --> 01:19:57.951
- A Pole?
- A Pole.


590
01:19:58.034 --> 01:20:00.370
Where was this? 
At the station?

591
01:20:00.454 --> 01:20:06.334
It was where the train had stopped.

592
01:20:06.418 --> 01:20:08.295
On one side was the wood,

593
01:20:08.378 --> 01:20:11.423
and on the other were fields.

594
01:20:11.506 --> 01:20:13.800
And there was a farmer in a field?

595
01:20:13.884 --> 01:20:16.928
We saw cows

596
01:20:17.012 --> 01:20:20.765
watched over by a young man,

597
01:20:20.849 --> 01:20:25.854
a farmhand.

598
01:20:26.188 --> 01:20:28.273
And one of you questioned him?

599
01:20:28.356 --> 01:20:35.155
Not in words, but in signs, we asked,
“What's going on here?”


600
01:20:35.238 --> 01:20:38.241
And he made that gesture. Like this.

601
01:20:40.243 --> 01:20:43.246
We didn't really

602
01:20:44.164 --> 01:20:47.042
pay much attention to him.

603
01:20:47.125 --> 01:20:49.544
We couldn't figure out what he meant.

604
01:21:09.272 --> 01:21:11.858
Once there were foreign Jews...

605
01:21:12.400 --> 01:21:14.194
They were this fat...

606
01:21:14.486 --> 01:21:15.779
This fat?

607
01:21:16.279 --> 01:21:19.282
Riding in passenger cars.

608
01:21:19.533 --> 01:21:22.536
There was a dining car,
they could drink


609
01:21:22.619 --> 01:21:24.913
and walk around, too.

610
01:21:25.372 --> 01:21:28.959
They said they were going to a factory.

611
01:21:29.209 --> 01:21:33.797
On arrival, they saw
what kind of a factory it was.


612
01:21:37.968 --> 01:21:39.553
We'd gesture...

613
01:21:39.636 --> 01:21:41.137
Gesture how?

614
01:21:43.557 --> 01:21:45.392
That they'd be killed.

615
01:21:45.475 --> 01:21:47.143
These people made that sign?

616
01:21:47.227 --> 01:21:49.312
He says the Jews didn't believe it.

617
01:21:49.396 --> 01:21:51.648
But what does that gesture mean?

618
01:21:54.609 --> 01:21:56.778
That death awaited them.

619
01:22:08.999 --> 01:22:12.168
The people who had a chance
to get near the Jews


620
01:22:12.252 --> 01:22:14.546
did that to warn them...

621
01:22:14.629 --> 01:22:17.966
- He did it too?
- That they'd be hanged, killed, slain.


622
01:22:19.009 --> 01:22:20.010
Yes.

623
01:22:23.430 --> 01:22:27.434
Even foreign Jews
from Belgium, Czechoslovakia,


624
01:22:27.517 --> 01:22:29.853
from France too, surely.

625
01:22:31.021 --> 01:22:32.689
And from Holland...

626
01:22:35.275 --> 01:22:36.860
These didn't know,

627
01:22:44.451 --> 01:22:48.038
but the Polish Jews knew.

628
01:22:48.121 --> 01:22:53.877
In the small cities in the area,

629
01:22:54.085 --> 01:22:55.295
it was talked about.

630
01:22:55.378 --> 01:22:59.466
So the Polish Jews were forewarned,
but not the others.


631
01:22:59.549 --> 01:23:02.552
Who'd they warn,
Polish Jews or the others?


632
01:23:08.558 --> 01:23:11.353
All the Jews.

633
01:23:36.628 --> 01:23:40.173
He says the foreign Jews
arrived here in passenger cars,


634
01:23:40.256 --> 01:23:42.759
they were well dressed, in white shirts,

635
01:23:42.842 --> 01:23:47.222
there were ﬂowers in the cars,
and they played cards.


636
01:23:48.223 --> 01:23:52.268
From what I know, that was very rare,

637
01:23:52.519 --> 01:23:55.980
Jews shipped in passenger cars.

638
01:23:56.064 --> 01:24:00.360
Most arrived in cattle cars.

639
01:24:15.125 --> 01:24:17.043
It's not true.

640
01:24:18.128 --> 01:24:19.796
It's not true?

641
01:24:22.424 --> 01:24:24.217
What did Mrs. Gawkowska say?

642
01:24:24.300 --> 01:24:28.054
She said he may not
have seen everything.


643
01:24:29.973 --> 01:24:32.100
He says he did.

644
01:24:59.294 --> 01:25:02.422
Once, at the Malkinia station,
for example,


645
01:25:02.505 --> 01:25:05.842
a foreign Jew left the train

646
01:25:05.925 --> 01:25:08.261
to buy something at the bar.

647
01:25:09.554 --> 01:25:13.975
The train pulled out
and he ran after it...


648
01:25:14.058 --> 01:25:15.810
To catch up to it.

649
01:25:17.187 --> 01:25:22.400
So he went past these “Pullmans,”
as he calls them,


650
01:25:22.484 --> 01:25:27.614
those Jews who were calm, unsuspecting,

651
01:25:27.697 --> 01:25:30.200
and he made that gesture to them.

652
01:25:41.586 --> 01:25:43.797
To all the Jews, in principle.

653
01:25:43.880 --> 01:25:46.633
He just went along the platform.
Ask him.


654
01:25:53.765 --> 01:25:58.061
Yes. The road was as it is now.

655
01:26:00.271 --> 01:26:04.651
When the guard wasn't looking,

656
01:26:04.901 --> 01:26:07.362
he made that gesture.

657
01:26:12.367 --> 01:26:15.537
Ask Mr. Gawkowski why he looks so sad.

658
01:26:24.921 --> 01:26:27.757
Because I saw men
marching to their death.


659
01:26:30.718 --> 01:26:32.846
Precisely where are we now?

660
01:26:42.605 --> 01:26:47.485
It's not far...
a mile and a half from here.


661
01:26:47.569 --> 01:26:48.862
What, the camp?

662
01:26:55.618 --> 01:26:58.955
What's that dirt road he's indicating?

663
01:27:07.964 --> 01:27:11.134
That's where the rail line
into the camp was.


664
01:27:29.319 --> 01:27:33.156
<i>Did Mr. Gawkowski,
aside from the trains of deportees</i>


665
01:27:33.239 --> 01:27:38.870
<i>he drove from Warsaw or Bialystok
to the Treblinka station...</i>


666
01:27:38.953 --> 01:27:43.499
<i>Did he ever drive the deportee cars</i>

667
01:27:43.583 --> 01:27:46.502
<i>into the camp
from the Treblinka station?</i>


668
01:28:03.311 --> 01:28:05.104
<i>Did he do it often?</i>

669
01:28:09.025 --> 01:28:11.694
<i>Two or three times a week.</i>

670
01:28:12.445 --> 01:28:14.030
<i>Over how long a period?</i>

671
01:28:18.701 --> 01:28:20.912
<i>Around a year and a half.</i>

672
01:28:21.204 --> 01:28:25.124
<i>That is,
throughout the camp's existence?</i>


673
01:29:04.664 --> 01:29:06.374
<i>This is the ramp.</i>

674
01:29:07.750 --> 01:29:10.712
Here he is, he goes
to the end with his locomotive,


675
01:29:10.795 --> 01:29:14.048
and he has the 20 cars behind him.

676
01:29:20.304 --> 01:29:23.182
No, they're in front of him.

677
01:29:23.266 --> 01:29:24.892
He pushed them?

678
01:29:26.060 --> 01:29:27.729
That's right, he pushed them.

679
01:30:26.162 --> 01:30:28.247
<i>In February 1942,</i>

680
01:30:28.331 --> 01:30:31.459
<i>I began working here
as an assistant switchman.</i>


681
01:30:33.044 --> 01:30:36.380
The station building,
the rails, the platforms


682
01:30:36.464 --> 01:30:39.509
are just as they were in 1942?

683
01:30:39.592 --> 01:30:41.677
Nothing's changed?

684
01:30:45.431 --> 01:30:46.432
Nothing.

685
01:30:46.516 --> 01:30:49.393
Exactly where did the camp begin?

686
01:30:52.480 --> 01:30:54.607
JAN PIWONSKI

687
01:30:55.191 --> 01:30:57.860
I'll show you exactly.

688
01:31:17.296 --> 01:31:18.714
Here,

689
01:31:25.138 --> 01:31:29.308
there was a fence that ran
to those trees you see there.


690
01:31:36.232 --> 01:31:39.485
And another fence
that ran to those trees over there.


691
01:31:40.403 --> 01:31:44.907
So I'm standing
inside the camp perimeter, right?


692
01:31:48.744 --> 01:31:49.829
That's right.

693
01:31:49.912 --> 01:31:53.666
Where I am now
is 50 feet from the station,


694
01:31:53.749 --> 01:31:55.585
and I'm already outside the camp.

695
01:32:00.256 --> 01:32:01.424
Yes.

696
01:32:04.886 --> 01:32:07.847
So this is the Polish part,
and over there was death.


697
01:32:11.559 --> 01:32:12.226
Yes.

698
01:32:23.029 --> 01:32:27.783
<i>On German orders,
Polish railmen split up the trains.</i>


699
01:32:34.916 --> 01:32:36.876
<i>So the locomotive took 20 cars</i>

700
01:32:36.959 --> 01:32:40.046
<i>and headed toward Chelm.</i>

701
01:32:42.840 --> 01:32:45.259
<i>When it reached a switch,</i>

702
01:32:47.220 --> 01:32:53.684
<i>it pushed the cars into the camp
on the other track we can see.</i>


703
01:32:54.518 --> 01:32:55.770
The ramp began there.

704
01:32:55.853 --> 01:32:59.232
So here we're outside the camp,

705
01:32:59.315 --> 01:33:03.736
and back here we enter it.

706
01:33:03.819 --> 01:33:08.491
Unlike Treblinka,
the station here is part of the camp.


707
01:33:13.955 --> 01:33:18.459
And at this point,
we are inside the camp.


708
01:33:21.337 --> 01:33:24.173
This track was inside the camp.

709
01:33:25.007 --> 01:33:27.343
And it's exactly as it was?

710
01:33:32.390 --> 01:33:34.183
Yes, the same track.

711
01:33:34.642 --> 01:33:36.852
It hasn't changed since then.

712
01:33:36.936 --> 01:33:41.023
Where we are now
is what was called the ramp, right?


713
01:33:49.824 --> 01:33:54.620
Yes, those to be exterminated
were unloaded here.


714
01:33:54.704 --> 01:33:56.163
So where we're standing

715
01:33:56.247 --> 01:34:01.127
is where 250,000 Jews
were unloaded before being gassed.


716
01:34:05.631 --> 01:34:06.632
Yes.

717
01:34:12.221 --> 01:34:16.892
<i>Did foreign Jews arrive here
in passenger cars, too?</i>


718
01:34:26.068 --> 01:34:27.820
<i>Not always.</i>

719
01:34:32.408 --> 01:34:34.452
<i>Often the richest Jews,</i>

720
01:34:36.078 --> 01:34:38.331
<i>from Belgium, Holland, France,</i>

721
01:34:40.041 --> 01:34:42.293
<i>arrived in passenger cars,</i>

722
01:34:43.085 --> 01:34:45.338
<i>sometimes even in 1st class.</i>

723
01:34:49.383 --> 01:34:52.428
<i>They were usually better treated
by the guards.</i>


724
01:35:14.825 --> 01:35:18.329
Especially the convoys
of Western European Jews


725
01:35:18.412 --> 01:35:20.956
waiting their turn here,

726
01:35:23.793 --> 01:35:28.005
Polish railmen saw the women
putting on make-up, combing their hair,


727
01:35:28.089 --> 01:35:31.634
wholly unaware
of what awaited them minutes later.


728
01:35:32.468 --> 01:35:34.303
They dolled up.

729
01:35:45.314 --> 01:35:47.650
And the Poles
couldn't tell them anything:


730
01:35:47.733 --> 01:35:53.030
The guards forbad contact
with the future victims.


731
01:36:00.955 --> 01:36:03.499
<i>I suppose there were fine days
like today.</i>


732
01:36:11.173 --> 01:36:13.843
<i>Unfortunately, some were even finer.</i>

733
01:37:23.579 --> 01:37:26.665
RUDOLF VRBA - NEW YORK, USA,
survivor of Auschwitz


734
01:37:50.940 --> 01:37:54.026
AUSCHWITZ 
- BIRKENAU

735
01:42:47.736 --> 01:42:51.824
And suddenly it started:
the yelling and screaming.


736
01:42:52.825 --> 01:42:54.785
“AII out, everybody out!”

737
01:42:55.244 --> 01:42:59.373
All those shouts,
the uproar, the tumult!


738
01:42:59.915 --> 01:43:02.209
“Out! Get out!

739
01:43:04.920 --> 01:43:07.130
Leave the baggage!”

740
01:43:07.673 --> 01:43:11.426
We got out, stepping on each other.

741
01:43:18.600 --> 01:43:22.104
We saw men wearing blue armbands.

742
01:43:22.187 --> 01:43:26.817
Some carried whips.

743
01:43:28.986 --> 01:43:31.697
We saw some SS men.

744
01:43:31.780 --> 01:43:34.908
Green uniforms,

745
01:43:34.992 --> 01:43:40.080
black uniforms...

746
01:43:42.791 --> 01:43:44.793
<i>We were a mass,</i>

747
01:43:47.045 --> 01:43:50.549
<i>and the mass swept us along.</i>

748
01:43:50.632 --> 01:43:52.426
<i>It was irresistible.</i>

749
01:43:52.509 --> 01:43:55.846
<i>It had to move to another place.</i>

750
01:44:08.150 --> 01:44:10.652
<i>I saw the others undressing.</i>

751
01:44:12.154 --> 01:44:16.700
<i>And I heard, “Get undressed!
You're to be disinfected!”</i>


752
01:44:19.244 --> 01:44:22.831
<i>As I waited, already naked,</i>

753
01:44:22.915 --> 01:44:29.880
<i>I noticed the SS men
separating out some people.</i>


754
01:44:29.963 --> 01:44:32.299
<i>These were told to get dressed.</i>

755
01:44:34.217 --> 01:44:40.307
<i>A passing SS man
suddenly stopped in front of me,</i>


756
01:44:41.683 --> 01:44:45.270
<i>looked me over, and said,</i>

757
01:44:45.354 --> 01:44:50.108
<i>“Yes, you too, quick,
join the others, get dressed.</i>


758
01:44:50.359 --> 01:44:54.947
<i>You're going to work here,
and if you're good,</i>


759
01:44:55.030 --> 01:44:57.824
<i>you can be a
kapo... a squad leader. ”</i>

760
01:48:17.941 --> 01:48:20.861
BIRKENAUI THE RAMP

761
01:48:54.477 --> 01:48:58.440
<i>We were taken to the barracks.</i>

762
01:48:59.858 --> 01:49:03.361
<i>The whole place stank.</i>

763
01:49:05.614 --> 01:49:09.284
<i>Piled about five feet high</i>

764
01:49:09.659 --> 01:49:14.623
<i>in a jumbled mass,</i>

765
01:49:14.706 --> 01:49:19.628
<i>were all the things people
could conceivably have brought.</i>


766
01:49:21.046 --> 01:49:24.633
<i>Clothes, suitcases,</i>

767
01:49:24.716 --> 01:49:29.888
<i>everything stacked in a solid mass.</i>

768
01:49:30.972 --> 01:49:34.893
<i>On top of it,
jumping around like demons,</i>


769
01:49:34.976 --> 01:49:40.607
<i>people were making bundles</i>

770
01:49:41.024 --> 01:49:44.319
<i>and carrying them outside.</i>

771
01:49:45.237 --> 01:49:49.407
<i>I was turned over
to one of these men.</i>

772
01:49:49.491 --> 01:49:54.204
<i>His armband said, “Squad Leader.”</i>

773
01:49:54.871 --> 01:49:56.456
<i>He shouted,</i>

774
01:49:56.539 --> 01:50:02.629
<i>and I understood that I was also
to pick up clothing, bundle it,</i>


775
01:50:04.297 --> 01:50:09.970
<i>and take it somewhere.</i>

776
01:50:12.389 --> 01:50:15.934
<i>As I worked, 
I asked him,</i>

777
01:50:16.017 --> 01:50:20.605
<i>“What's going on?
The undressed ones... Where are they?”</i>


778
01:50:21.690 --> 01:50:26.736
<i>And he replied, “Dead! 
All dead!”</i>

779
01:50:29.114 --> 01:50:33.743
<i>But it still hadn't sunk in,
I didn't believe it.</i>


780
01:50:34.411 --> 01:50:36.246
<i>He'd used the Yiddish word.</i>

781
01:50:36.329 --> 01:50:41.960
<i>It was the first time
I'd heard Yiddish spoken.</i>


782
01:50:44.713 --> 01:50:48.967
He didn't say it very loud,

783
01:50:50.051 --> 01:50:54.931
and I saw he
had tears in his eyes.

784
01:50:55.974 --> 01:50:59.811
Suddenly he started shouting

785
01:50:59.894 --> 01:51:01.896
and raised his whip.

786
01:51:02.147 --> 01:51:07.193
Out of the corner of my eyes,
I saw an SS man coming.


787
01:51:07.277 --> 01:51:11.406
And I understood
that I was to ask no more questions,


788
01:51:11.656 --> 01:51:17.996
but just to rush outside
with the package.


789
01:52:41.204 --> 01:52:45.834
<i>All I could think of then
was my friend Care! Unger.</i>


790
01:52:47.544 --> 01:52:51.172
<i>He'd been at the rear of the train,</i>

791
01:52:51.256 --> 01:52:56.052
<i>in a section that had been uncoupled
and left outside.</i>


792
01:52:57.846 --> 01:53:02.767
<i>I needed someone.
Near me. With me.</i>


793
01:53:06.229 --> 01:53:10.275
<i>Then I saw him.
He was in the 2nd group.</i>


794
01:53:10.358 --> 01:53:13.027
<i>He'd been spared too.</i>

795
01:53:15.738 --> 01:53:20.994
On the way, somehow,
he had learned, he already knew.


796
01:53:21.077 --> 01:53:23.705
He looked at me,

797
01:53:25.123 --> 01:53:31.004
all he said was,
“Richard, my father, mother, brother...”


798
01:53:32.964 --> 01:53:36.176
He had learned on the way there.

799
01:53:38.887 --> 01:53:42.640
Your meeting with Carel:

800
01:53:42.724 --> 01:53:46.394
how long after your arrival
did it happen?


801
01:53:47.937 --> 01:53:54.652
It was... around 20 minutes
after we reached Treblinka.


802
01:54:01.701 --> 01:54:04.829
<i>Then I left the barracks</i>

803
01:54:04.913 --> 01:54:09.834
<i>and had my first
look at the vast space</i>

804
01:54:10.585 --> 01:54:17.759
<i>that I soon learned
was called “the sorting place.”</i>


805
01:54:18.927 --> 01:54:24.265
<i>It was buried under mountains
of objects of all kinds.</i>


806
01:54:25.016 --> 01:54:29.646
<i>Mountains of shoes,
of clothes, 30 feet high.</i>


807
01:54:32.440 --> 01:54:36.402
<i>I thought about it and said to Carel,</i>

808
01:54:36.486 --> 01:54:39.697
<i>“I! is a hurricane, a raging sea.</i>

809
01:54:39.781 --> 01:54:43.868
<i>We're shipwrecked.
And we're still alive.</i>


810
01:54:43.952 --> 01:54:46.412
<i>We must do nothing</i>

811
01:54:46.496 --> 01:54:49.707
<i>but watch for every new wave,</i>

812
01:54:49.791 --> 01:54:52.877
<i>ﬂoat on it,</i>

813
01:54:52.961 --> 01:54:58.883
<i>get ready for the next wave,</i>

814
01:54:58.967 --> 01:55:01.052
<i>and ride the wave at all costs.</i>

815
01:55:01.135 --> 01:55:03.555
<i>And nothing else.”</i>

816
01:57:44.215 --> 01:57:47.260
<i>Greenery, sand everywhere else.</i>

817
01:57:47.635 --> 01:57:50.763
<i>At night, we were put into barracks.</i>

818
01:57:50.847 --> 01:57:52.807
<i>It just had a sand ﬂoor.</i>

819
01:57:52.890 --> 01:57:55.351
<i>Nothing else.</i>

820
01:57:55.810 --> 01:58:01.232
<i>Each of us simply dropped
where he stood.</i>


821
01:58:01.983 --> 01:58:08.156
<i>Half asleep,
I heard some men hang themselves.</i>


822
01:58:08.364 --> 01:58:12.577
<i>We didn't react then.
It was almost normal.</i>


823
01:58:14.162 --> 01:58:16.247
Just as it was normal

824
01:58:16.330 --> 01:58:23.880
that for everyone behind whom
the gate of Treblinka closed,


825
01:58:24.338 --> 01:58:28.176
there was death, had to be death,

826
01:58:28.426 --> 01:58:35.224
for no one was supposed
to be left to bear witness.


827
01:58:37.018 --> 01:58:41.147
I already knew that,

828
01:58:41.230 --> 01:58:46.778
three hours after arriving at Treblinka.

829
02:00:56.824 --> 02:00:59.160
BERLIN

830
02:03:30.561 --> 02:03:33.856
INGE DEUTSCHKRON
Born in Berlin


831
02:03:34.148 --> 02:03:37.735
Lived there through the war

832
02:03:38.110 --> 02:03:42.156
(In hiding beginning in February 1943)

833
02:03:42.490 --> 02:03:46.368
Now lives in Israel

834
02:05:15.207 --> 02:05:18.836
FRANZ SUCHOMEL:
SS Unterscharfuhrer


835
02:05:21.046 --> 02:05:24.884
- <i>Are you ready?</i>
- <i>Yes.</i>


836
02:05:24.967 --> 02:05:27.636
- <i>Then we can...</i>
- <i>We can begin.</i>


837
02:05:31.307 --> 02:05:35.519
<i>How's your heart?
Is everything in order?</i>


838
02:05:36.729 --> 02:05:39.648
<i>Oh, my heart...
For the moment, ifs all right.</i>


839
02:05:39.732 --> 02:05:43.360
<i>If I have any pain, 
I'll tell you.</i>

840
02:05:43.444 --> 02:05:45.029
<i>We'll have to break off.</i>

841
02:05:45.112 --> 02:05:46.780
<i>Of course.</i>

842
02:05:48.824 --> 02:05:51.285
<i>But your health, in general, is...</i>

843
02:05:51.368 --> 02:05:55.289
<i>The weather today suits me fine.</i>

844
02:05:55.539 --> 02:06:00.252
<i>The barometric pressure is high:
That's good for me.</i>


845
02:06:00.461 --> 02:06:04.381
<i>You look to be in good shape, anyway.</i>

846
02:06:05.257 --> 02:06:09.094
<i>Let's begin with Treblinka.</i>

847
02:06:09.178 --> 02:06:10.387
<i>Certainly.</i>

848
02:06:10.471 --> 02:06:12.473
<i>I think that's best.</i>

849
02:06:12.848 --> 02:06:15.601
<i>If you could give us</i>

850
02:06:18.479 --> 02:06:22.441
<i>a description of Treblinka.</i>

851
02:06:23.150 --> 02:06:26.570
<i>How did it look when you arrived?</i>

852
02:06:26.654 --> 02:06:31.742
<i>I believe you got there in August?</i>

853
02:06:31.825 --> 02:06:34.995
<i>Was it August 20 or 24?</i>

854
02:06:35.829 --> 02:06:38.791
<i>The 18th?
- I don't know exactly.</i>


855
02:06:38.874 --> 02:06:42.253
<i>Around August 20.</i>

856
02:06:43.462 --> 02:06:47.424
<i>I arrived there with seven other men.</i>

857
02:06:48.050 --> 02:06:49.593
<i>From Berlin?</i>

858
02:06:49.677 --> 02:06:50.970
<i>From Berlin.</i>

859
02:06:51.053 --> 02:06:52.763
<i>From Lublin?</i>

860
02:06:53.555 --> 02:06:57.601
<i>From Berlin to Warsaw,
from Warsaw to Lublin,</i>


861
02:06:57.685 --> 02:07:03.065
<i>from Lublin back to Warsaw
and from Warsaw to Treblinka.</i>


862
02:07:03.357 --> 02:07:07.695
<i>What was Treblinka like then?</i>

863
02:07:08.362 --> 02:07:13.284
Treblinka then was operating
at full capacity.


864
02:07:13.867 --> 02:07:16.537
- Full capacity?
- Full capacity!


865
02:07:18.205 --> 02:07:20.541
Trains arrived...

866
02:07:21.834 --> 02:07:26.255
The Warsaw ghetto
was being emptied then.


867
02:07:28.048 --> 02:07:34.596
Three trains arrived in two days,

868
02:07:36.140 --> 02:07:43.272
each with three, four,
five thousand people aboard,


869
02:07:44.231 --> 02:07:46.734
all from Warsaw.

870
02:07:47.401 --> 02:07:52.573
But at the same time,
other trains came in


871
02:07:53.449 --> 02:07:58.245
from Kielce and other places.

872
02:07:59.246 --> 02:08:02.458
So three trains arrived,

873
02:08:03.417 --> 02:08:09.548
and since the offensive
against Stalingrad was in fear,


874
02:08:09.757 --> 02:08:14.636
the trainloads of Jews
were left on a station siding.


875
02:08:15.596 --> 02:08:20.768
What's more, the cars were French,

876
02:08:21.727 --> 02:08:23.812
made of steel.

877
02:08:24.063 --> 02:08:30.277
So that while 5,000 Jews
arrived in Treblinka,


878
02:08:30.903 --> 02:08:33.655
3,000 were dead.

879
02:08:34.323 --> 02:08:36.492
- In the...
- In the cars.


880
02:08:36.575 --> 02:08:39.119
They had slashed their wrists,

881
02:08:40.996 --> 02:08:44.500
or just died.

882
02:08:46.502 --> 02:08:50.881
The ones we unloaded
were half-dead


883
02:08:50.964 --> 02:08:55.886
and half-mad.

884
02:08:58.180 --> 02:09:03.852
<i>In the other trains from Kielce</i>

885
02:09:04.144 --> 02:09:06.647
<i>and elsewhere,</i>

886
02:09:07.356 --> 02:09:10.150
<i>at least half were dead.</i>

887
02:09:11.110 --> 02:09:15.239
We stacked them here, here,

888
02:09:17.282 --> 02:09:19.368
here and here.

889
02:09:19.952 --> 02:09:22.830
Thousands of people

890
02:09:23.831 --> 02:09:27.042
piled one on top of another.

891
02:09:29.169 --> 02:09:31.505
- On the ramp?
- On the ramp.


892
02:09:32.172 --> 02:09:35.342
Stacked like wood.

893
02:09:35.717 --> 02:09:36.969
In addition,

894
02:09:37.052 --> 02:09:42.766
other Jews, still alive,
waited there for two days:


895
02:09:42.850 --> 02:09:47.229
The small gas chambers
could no longer handle the number.


896
02:09:47.312 --> 02:09:54.236
They functioned
day and night in that period.


897
02:09:54.319 --> 02:09:58.866
Can you please describe, very precisely,

898
02:09:59.241 --> 02:10:03.328
your first impression of Treblinka?

899
02:10:03.412 --> 02:10:07.291
Very precisely. it's very important.

900
02:10:07.374 --> 02:10:11.879
My first impression of Treblinka,

901
02:10:12.504 --> 02:10:18.552
and that of some of the other men,
was catastrophic.


902
02:10:19.428 --> 02:10:22.389
For we had not been told

903
02:10:23.223 --> 02:10:28.395
how and what...
that people were being killed there.


904
02:10:28.770 --> 02:10:30.314
They hadn't told us.

905
02:10:30.397 --> 02:10:32.524
- You didn't know?
- No!


906
02:10:33.150 --> 02:10:35.819
Incredible!

907
02:10:36.069 --> 02:10:40.073
But true. I didn't want to go.

908
02:10:40.782 --> 02:10:43.368
That was proved at my trial.

909
02:10:43.577 --> 02:10:45.871
I was told,

910
02:10:45.954 --> 02:10:47.873
“Mr. Suchomel,

911
02:10:48.540 --> 02:10:52.669
there are big workshops there
for tailors and shoemakers,


912
02:10:52.920 --> 02:10:55.756
and you'll be guarding them.”

913
02:10:56.507 --> 02:11:00.928
Nothing more.
- But you knew it was a camp?


914
02:11:01.011 --> 02:11:03.472
Yes. We were told,

915
02:11:03.764 --> 02:11:09.895
“The Fuhrer ordered
a resettlement program.


916
02:11:10.103 --> 02:11:13.106
It's an order from the Fuhrer.”

917
02:11:13.982 --> 02:11:16.401
Understand?
- Resettlement program...


918
02:11:20.072 --> 02:11:22.741
No one ever spoke of killing.

919
02:11:24.117 --> 02:11:25.869
<i>I understand.</i>

920
02:11:25.953 --> 02:11:30.207
<i>Mr. Suchomel, we're not discussing you,</i>

921
02:11:30.290 --> 02:11:32.251
<i>only Treblinka.</i>

922
02:11:32.334 --> 02:11:35.754
<i>You are a very important eyewitness,</i>

923
02:11:35.837 --> 02:11:40.676
<i>and you can explain what Treblinka was.</i>

924
02:11:40.759 --> 02:11:42.886
<i>But don't use my name.</i>

925
02:11:42.970 --> 02:11:47.182
<i>No, I promise.</i>

926
02:11:49.017 --> 02:11:52.062
<i>All right, you've arrived at Treblinka.</i>

927
02:11:52.145 --> 02:11:55.649
<i>So Stadie, the sarge,</i>

928
02:11:56.149 --> 02:11:59.611
<i>showed us the camp</i>

929
02:12:01.280 --> 02:12:04.908
<i>from end to end.</i>

930
02:12:07.160 --> 02:12:10.956
<i>Just as we went by,</i>

931
02:12:11.039 --> 02:12:16.712
<i>they were opening the gas chamber doors,</i>

932
02:12:16.795 --> 02:12:21.383
<i>and people fell out like potatoes.</i>

933
02:12:24.678 --> 02:12:29.683
<i>Naturally, that horrified
and appalled us.</i>


934
02:12:30.183 --> 02:12:34.813
<i>We went back and sat down
on our suitcases</i>


935
02:12:34.896 --> 02:12:38.358
<i>and cried like old women.</i>

936
02:12:42.863 --> 02:12:47.534
<i>Each day, 100 Jews were chosen</i>

937
02:12:48.160 --> 02:12:52.205
<i>to drag the corpses to the mass graves.</i>

938
02:12:53.540 --> 02:13:01.423
<i>In the evening, the Ukrainians drove
those Jews into the gas chambers</i>


939
02:13:01.673 --> 02:13:03.300
<i>or shot them.</i>

940
02:13:03.383 --> 02:13:05.135
<i>Every day!</i>

941
02:13:07.554 --> 02:13:10.766
<i>It was in the hottest days of August.</i>

942
02:13:14.227 --> 02:13:19.066
The ground undulated like waves

943
02:13:19.274 --> 02:13:21.151
because of the gas.

944
02:13:21.234 --> 02:13:23.445
From the bodies?

945
02:13:23.779 --> 02:13:28.408
Bear in mind, the graves
were maybe 18, 20 feet deep,


946
02:13:29.242 --> 02:13:33.747
all crammed with bodies!

947
02:13:34.539 --> 02:13:38.960
A thin layer of sand
and the heat. You see?


948
02:13:39.211 --> 02:13:41.505
It was hell up there.

949
02:13:41.588 --> 02:13:42.923
You saw that?

950
02:13:43.006 --> 02:13:46.885
Yes, just once, the first day.

951
02:13:46.968 --> 02:13:49.930
We puked and wept.

952
02:13:50.013 --> 02:13:52.766
- You wept?
- We wept too, yes.


953
02:13:56.937 --> 02:13:59.648
The smell was infernal.

954
02:13:59.940 --> 02:14:04.194
Yes, because gas
was constantly escaping.


955
02:14:04.277 --> 02:14:08.740
It stank horribly, for miles around.

956
02:14:09.032 --> 02:14:11.243
- Miles?
- Miles!


957
02:14:11.326 --> 02:14:13.495
You could smell it all around,

958
02:14:14.287 --> 02:14:16.331
not just in the camp?

959
02:14:16.415 --> 02:14:20.585
Everywhere. It depended on the wind.

960
02:14:20.669 --> 02:14:23.630
The stink was carried on the wind.

961
02:14:24.631 --> 02:14:26.550
Understand?

962
02:14:34.641 --> 02:14:38.895
<i>More people kept coming, always more,</i>

963
02:14:38.979 --> 02:14:42.816
<i>whom we hadn't the facilities to kill.</i>

964
02:14:48.697 --> 02:14:54.035
<i>Those gents were in a rush
to clean out the Warsaw ghetto.</i>


965
02:14:57.372 --> 02:15:01.376
<i>The gas chambers
couldn't handle the load.</i>


966
02:15:01.460 --> 02:15:04.004
<i>The small gas chambers.</i>

967
02:15:20.687 --> 02:15:24.274
<i>The Jews had to wait their turn</i>

968
02:15:24.357 --> 02:15:28.862
<i>for a day, 2 days, 3 days.</i>

969
02:15:35.160 --> 02:15:37.537
<i>They foresaw what was coming.</i>

970
02:15:38.663 --> 02:15:41.208
<i>They foresaw it.</i>

971
02:15:42.542 --> 02:15:47.881
<i>They may not have been certain,
but many knew.</i>


972
02:15:52.719 --> 02:15:57.307
<i>There were Jewish women</i>

973
02:15:57.849 --> 02:16:01.645
<i>who slashed
their daughters' wrists at night,</i>


974
02:16:01.895 --> 02:16:05.232
<i>then cut their own.</i>

975
02:16:06.024 --> 02:16:08.735
<i>Others poisoned themselves.</i>

976
02:16:10.028 --> 02:16:15.575
<i>They heard the engine
feeding the gas chamber.</i>


977
02:16:18.703 --> 02:16:23.291
<i>A tank engine was used
in that gas chamber.</i>


978
02:16:25.085 --> 02:16:30.632
<i>At Treblinka, the only gas used
was engine exhaust.</i>


979
02:16:31.091 --> 02:16:33.510
<i>Zyklon gas, that was Auschwitz.</i>

980
02:16:40.267 --> 02:16:44.104
<i>Because of the delay,</i>

981
02:16:44.855 --> 02:16:49.651
<i>Eberl, the camp commandant,</i>

982
02:16:50.610 --> 02:16:54.948
<i>phoned Lublin and said,</i>

983
02:16:55.699 --> 02:16:59.870
<i>“We can't go on this way.
I can't do it any longer.</i>


984
02:16:59.953 --> 02:17:04.165
<i>We have to break off.”</i>

985
02:17:04.249 --> 02:17:07.961
<i>Overnight, Wirth arrived.</i>

986
02:17:09.087 --> 02:17:12.841
<i>He inspected everything and then left.</i>

987
02:17:12.924 --> 02:17:17.053
<i>He returned with people from Belzec,</i>

988
02:17:17.137 --> 02:17:19.472
<i>experts.</i>

989
02:17:20.640 --> 02:17:25.270
<i>Wirth arranged to suspend the trains.</i>

990
02:17:27.814 --> 02:17:33.278
<i>The corpses lying there
were cleared away.</i>


991
02:17:34.321 --> 02:17:38.950
That was the period
of the old gas chambers.


992
02:17:39.492 --> 02:17:44.581
Because there were so many dead

993
02:17:44.664 --> 02:17:47.417
that couldn't be gotten rid of,

994
02:17:48.001 --> 02:17:52.255
for days and days,

995
02:17:53.590 --> 02:17:58.678
the bodies piled up
around the gas chambers.


996
02:17:59.971 --> 02:18:04.351
Under this pile of bodies
was a cesspool:


997
02:18:05.101 --> 02:18:09.689
3 inches deep, full of blood, worms...

998
02:18:11.316 --> 02:18:13.526
and shit.

999
02:18:15.737 --> 02:18:18.823
- Where?
- In front of the gas chamber.


1000
02:18:21.451 --> 02:18:24.287
No one wanted to clean it out.

1001
02:18:24.371 --> 02:18:28.416
The Jews preferred to be shot

1002
02:18:29.542 --> 02:18:32.379
rather than work there.

1003
02:18:33.046 --> 02:18:35.548
Preferred to be shot?

1004
02:18:38.385 --> 02:18:44.307
It was awful. Burying
their own people, seeing it all...


1005
02:18:44.391 --> 02:18:48.728
The dead ﬂesh came off in their hands.

1006
02:18:49.854 --> 02:18:52.941
So Wirth went there himself

1007
02:18:53.984 --> 02:18:56.528
with a few Germans

1008
02:18:57.737 --> 02:19:01.741
and had long belts rigged up

1009
02:19:02.200 --> 02:19:06.788
that were wrapped
around the dead torsos to pull them...


1010
02:19:06.871 --> 02:19:09.332
- Who did that?
- SS men.


1011
02:19:09.416 --> 02:19:11.501
- Wirth?
- SS men and Jews.


1012
02:19:11.584 --> 02:19:13.378
SS men and Jews!

1013
02:19:14.170 --> 02:19:15.839
Jews too?

1014
02:19:15.922 --> 02:19:18.091
Jews too!

1015
02:19:20.051 --> 02:19:23.304
What did the Germans do?

1016
02:19:23.388 --> 02:19:26.850
They forced the Jews to...

1017
02:19:26.933 --> 02:19:29.185
They beat them?

1018
02:19:29.269 --> 02:19:34.691
Or they themselves helped
with the cleanup.


1019
02:19:34.774 --> 02:19:37.610
Which Germans did that?

1020
02:19:39.112 --> 02:19:45.285
Some of our guards
who were assigned up there.


1021
02:19:47.954 --> 02:19:49.497
The Germans themselves?

1022
02:19:49.581 --> 02:19:52.667
They had to.

1023
02:19:53.126 --> 02:19:54.586
They were in command!

1024
02:19:54.669 --> 02:20:00.133
They were in command,
but they were also commanded.


1025
02:20:00.216 --> 02:20:03.636
I think the Jews did it.

1026
02:20:04.888 --> 02:20:10.810
In that case,
the Germans had to lend a hand.


1027
02:20:12.645 --> 02:20:16.691
THE BLACK EXECUTION WALL
IN THE COURTYARD OF BLOCK II


1028
02:20:18.818 --> 02:20:22.947
AT AUSCHWITZ I,
THE ORIGINAL CAMP


1029
02:20:25.742 --> 02:20:29.746
<i>Filip, on that Sunday in May 1942,</i>

1030
02:20:29.829 --> 02:20:36.461
<i>when you first entered
the Auschwitz crematorium,</i>


1031
02:20:36.544 --> 02:20:38.338
<i>how old were you?</i>

1032
02:20:39.422 --> 02:20:41.216
<i>Twenty.</i>

1033
02:20:48.681 --> 02:20:51.684
<i>It was a Sunday in May.</i>

1034
02:20:59.359 --> 02:21:04.739
<i>We were locked
in an underground cell in Block 11.</i>


1035
02:21:06.282 --> 02:21:09.035
<i>We were held in secret.</i>

1036
02:21:13.331 --> 02:21:17.043
<i>Then some SS men appeared</i>

1037
02:21:18.878 --> 02:21:23.716
<i>and marched us
along a street in the camp.</i>


1038
02:21:33.977 --> 02:21:38.064
<i>We went through a gate,</i>

1039
02:21:44.529 --> 02:21:47.282
<i>and around 300 feet away,</i>

1040
02:21:48.241 --> 02:21:50.743
<i>300 feet from the gate,</i>

1041
02:21:51.327 --> 02:21:54.747
<i>I suddenly saw a building.</i>

1042
02:21:55.081 --> 02:22:00.795
<i>It had a ﬂat roof, and a smokestack.</i>

1043
02:22:09.679 --> 02:22:12.765
<i>I saw a door in the rear.</i>

1044
02:22:16.603 --> 02:22:22.275
<i>I thought they were taking us
to be shot.</i>


1045
02:22:24.569 --> 02:22:27.697
FILIP MULLER 
- CZECH JEW

1046
02:22:27.780 --> 02:22:32.660
Survivor of the 5 liquidations
of the Auschwitz “special detail”


1047
02:22:35.580 --> 02:22:39.459
<i>Suddenly, before a door</i>

1048
02:22:40.627 --> 02:22:46.299
<i>under a lamp
in the middle of this building,</i>


1049
02:22:46.382 --> 02:22:51.512
<i>a young SS man told us,</i>

1050
02:22:51.596 --> 02:22:54.724
<i>“Inside, filthy swine!”</i>

1051
02:22:54.807 --> 02:22:58.478
<i>We entered a corridor.</i>

1052
02:22:59.771 --> 02:23:02.649
<i>They drove us along it.</i>

1053
02:23:14.327 --> 02:23:20.333
<i>Right away, the stench,
the smoke choked me.</i>


1054
02:23:29.968 --> 02:23:32.679
<i>They kept on chasing us,</i>

1055
02:23:33.972 --> 02:23:38.351
<i>and then I made out the shapes</i>

1056
02:23:39.352 --> 02:23:42.855
<i>of the first two ovens.</i>

1057
02:23:47.986 --> 02:23:52.573
<i>Between the ovens,
some Jewish prisoners were working.</i>


1058
02:23:58.329 --> 02:24:03.418
<i>We were in the crematorium's
incineration chamber</i>


1059
02:24:03.876 --> 02:24:06.713
<i>in Camp I at Auschwitz.</i>

1060
02:24:13.219 --> 02:24:14.721
<i>From there,</i>

1061
02:24:15.221 --> 02:24:21.311
<i>they herded us to another big room,</i>

1062
02:24:25.565 --> 02:24:30.862
<i>and told us to undress the corpses.</i>

1063
02:24:33.573 --> 02:24:36.034
<i>I looked around me.</i>

1064
02:24:39.162 --> 02:24:42.749
<i>There were hundreds of bodies,</i>

1065
02:24:44.167 --> 02:24:46.544
<i>all dressed.</i>

1066
02:24:48.212 --> 02:24:50.965
<i>Piled with the corpses</i>

1067
02:24:52.258 --> 02:24:55.303
<i>were suitcases, bundles</i>

1068
02:24:56.012 --> 02:24:58.097
<i>and, scattered everywhere,</i>

1069
02:24:58.681 --> 02:25:02.810
<i>strange, bluish-purple crystals.</i>

1070
02:25:02.894 --> 02:25:06.147
<i>I couldn't understand any of it.</i>

1071
02:25:13.446 --> 02:25:19.369
<i>It was like a blow to the head...
as if you'd been stunned.</i>


1072
02:25:19.619 --> 02:25:22.872
<i>I didn't even know where I was.</i>

1073
02:25:22.955 --> 02:25:25.625
<i>Above all, I couldn't understand</i>

1074
02:25:25.708 --> 02:25:29.962
<i>how they managed
to kill so many people at once.</i>


1075
02:25:32.715 --> 02:25:36.177
<i>When we undressed some of them,</i>

1076
02:25:36.260 --> 02:25:40.139
<i>the order was given to feed the ovens.</i>

1077
02:25:44.644 --> 02:25:49.315
Suddenly, an SS man
rushed up and told me,


1078
02:25:49.399 --> 02:25:52.777
“Get out of here! 
Go stir the bodies!”

1079
02:25:53.152 --> 02:25:55.154
What did he mean,

1080
02:25:55.238 --> 02:25:57.615
“Stir the bodies”?

1081
02:25:58.157 --> 02:26:02.745
I entered the cremation chamber.

1082
02:26:02.829 --> 02:26:07.458
There was a Jewish prisoner,

1083
02:26:07.542 --> 02:26:11.629
Fischel, who later became
a squad leader.


1084
02:26:12.130 --> 02:26:13.881
He looked at me,

1085
02:26:14.549 --> 02:26:21.055
and I watched him
poke the fire with a long rod.


1086
02:26:21.639 --> 02:26:25.393
He told me, “Do as I'm doing

1087
02:26:25.476 --> 02:26:28.646
or the SS Will kill you.”

1088
02:26:29.272 --> 02:26:32.859
I picked up a poker

1089
02:26:32.942 --> 02:26:35.653
and did as he was doing.

1090
02:26:35.736 --> 02:26:38.072
A poker?

1091
02:26:38.156 --> 02:26:40.116
A steel poker.

1092
02:26:41.200 --> 02:26:44.620
I obeyed Fischel's order.

1093
02:26:44.704 --> 02:26:49.750
At that point I was in shock
as if I'd been hypnotized,


1094
02:26:50.501 --> 02:26:56.299
ready to do

1095
02:26:56.382 --> 02:26:58.885
whatever I was told.

1096
02:26:58.968 --> 02:27:05.683
I was so mindless, so horrified

1097
02:27:05.766 --> 02:27:13.858
that I did everything Fischel told me.

1098
02:27:14.400 --> 02:27:17.403
So the ovens were fed,

1099
02:27:18.154 --> 02:27:21.949
but we were so inexperienced

1100
02:27:22.992 --> 02:27:31.459
that we left the fans on too long.

1101
02:27:31.709 --> 02:27:34.754
- The fans?
- Yes.


1102
02:27:34.837 --> 02:27:39.133
There were fans
to make the fire hotter.


1103
02:27:39.592 --> 02:27:43.513
They worked too long...

1104
02:27:43.596 --> 02:27:48.893
The firebrick suddenly exploded,

1105
02:27:49.894 --> 02:27:55.107
blocking the pipes

1106
02:27:55.191 --> 02:27:58.611
linking the Auschwitz crematorium

1107
02:27:59.403 --> 02:28:02.698
with the smokestack.

1108
02:28:04.617 --> 02:28:08.829
<i>Cremation was interrupted.</i>

1109
02:28:09.455 --> 02:28:13.125
<i>The ovens were out of action.</i>

1110
02:28:15.711 --> 02:28:20.174
<i>That evening, some trucks came,</i>

1111
02:28:20.591 --> 02:28:22.885
<i>and we had to load the rest,</i>

1112
02:28:22.969 --> 02:28:26.055
<i>some 300 bodies,</i>

1113
02:28:26.138 --> 02:28:29.058
<i>into the trucks.</i>

1114
02:28:29.141 --> 02:28:34.146
<i>Then we were taken...</i>

1115
02:28:36.148 --> 02:28:39.235
<i>I still don't know where...</i>

1116
02:28:39.318 --> 02:28:44.282
<i>but probably to a field at Birkenau.</i>

1117
02:28:48.578 --> 02:28:55.001
<i>We were ordered
to unload the bodies</i>


1118
02:28:55.334 --> 02:29:01.716
<i>and put them in a pit.</i>

1119
02:29:02.300 --> 02:29:06.262
<i>There was a ditch, an artificial pit.</i>

1120
02:29:06.345 --> 02:29:09.890
<i>Suddenly, water gushed up
from underground</i>


1121
02:29:09.974 --> 02:29:13.185
<i>and swept the bodies down.</i>

1122
02:29:18.649 --> 02:29:23.571
<i>When night came,
we had to stop that horrible work.</i>


1123
02:29:24.530 --> 02:29:27.033
<i>We were loaded into the trucks</i>

1124
02:29:27.116 --> 02:29:31.537
<i>and returned to Auschwitz.</i>

1125
02:29:36.167 --> 02:29:37.835
<i>The next day,</i>

1126
02:29:38.127 --> 02:29:44.759
<i>we were taken to the same place.</i>

1127
02:29:52.558 --> 02:29:55.561
<i>But the water had risen.</i>

1128
02:29:57.229 --> 02:30:01.108
<i>Some SS men came
with a fire truck</i>


1129
02:30:01.192 --> 02:30:04.695
<i>and pumped out the water.</i>

1130
02:30:05.946 --> 02:30:09.992
<i>We had to go down
into that muddy pit</i>


1131
02:30:10.076 --> 02:30:13.788
<i>to stack up the bodies.</i>

1132
02:30:17.083 --> 02:30:18.834
But they were slimy.

1133
02:30:18.918 --> 02:30:23.339
For example, I grasped a woman,

1134
02:30:23.422 --> 02:30:25.758
but her hands...

1135
02:30:25.841 --> 02:30:28.177
Her hand was slippery, slimy.

1136
02:30:28.260 --> 02:30:30.846
I tried to pull her,

1137
02:30:30.930 --> 02:30:37.603
but I fell over backward,
into the water, the mud.


1138
02:30:39.188 --> 02:30:41.691
It was the same for all of us.

1139
02:30:41.774 --> 02:30:47.863
Up above, at the edge of the pit,
Aumeyer and Grabner yelled,


1140
02:30:47.947 --> 02:30:51.951
“Get cracking, you filth, you bastards!

1141
02:30:52.034 --> 02:30:56.706
We'll show you, you bunch of shits!”

1142
02:30:56.789 --> 02:30:59.959
These were the names they were calling us.

1143
02:31:00.292 --> 02:31:02.128
And in these...

1144
02:31:07.758 --> 02:31:10.344
how shall I say?
...circumstances,


1145
02:31:11.721 --> 02:31:16.642
2 of my “friends”
couldn't take any more.


1146
02:31:16.726 --> 02:31:19.478
One was a French student.

1147
02:31:21.480 --> 02:31:24.775
All Jews! They were exhausted.

1148
02:31:30.656 --> 02:31:33.826
They just lay there...

1149
02:31:34.660 --> 02:31:37.580
in the mud.

1150
02:31:37.830 --> 02:31:41.751
Aumeyer called one of his SS men.

1151
02:31:41.834 --> 02:31:45.671
“Go on, finish off those swine!”

1152
02:31:48.632 --> 02:31:53.179
They were exhausted.
And they were shot in the pit.


1153
02:31:59.143 --> 02:32:04.523
<i>There was no crematorium
at Birkenau then?</i>


1154
02:32:05.232 --> 02:32:09.695
<i>No, there weren't any there yet.</i>

1155
02:32:11.363 --> 02:32:14.366
<i>Birkenau still wasn't completely set up.</i>

1156
02:32:14.867 --> 02:32:20.289
<i>Only Camp BI, which was
the late women's camp, existed.</i>


1157
02:32:26.670 --> 02:32:30.466
<i>It wasn't until the spring of 1943</i>

1158
02:32:30.549 --> 02:32:36.055
<i>that skilled workmen
and unskilled laborers, all Jews,</i>


1159
02:32:36.138 --> 02:32:38.724
<i>must have gone to work here</i>

1160
02:32:38.808 --> 02:32:42.019
<i>and built the 4 crematorium.</i>

1161
02:32:45.564 --> 02:32:48.776
<i>Each crematorium had 15 ovens,</i>

1162
02:32:49.902 --> 02:32:54.740
<i>a big undressing room,
around 3,000 square feet,</i>


1163
02:32:55.574 --> 02:32:57.827
<i>and a big gas chamber</i>

1164
02:32:57.910 --> 02:33:02.540
<i>where up to 3,000 people at once
could be gassed.</i>


1165
02:33:05.251 --> 02:33:06.710
TREBLINKA

1166
02:33:06.794 --> 02:33:12.091
<i>The new gas chambers
were built in September 1942.</i>


1167
02:33:12.591 --> 02:33:14.927
<i>Who built them?</i>

1168
02:33:15.427 --> 02:33:23.185
<i>Hackenhold and Lambert supervised
the Jews who did the work,</i>


1169
02:33:23.435 --> 02:33:25.980
<i>the bricklaying, at least.</i>

1170
02:33:27.439 --> 02:33:33.737
<i>Ukrainian carpenters made the doors.</i>

1171
02:33:35.573 --> 02:33:39.285
<i>The gas chamber doors themselves</i>

1172
02:33:39.368 --> 02:33:43.497
<i>were armored bunker doors.</i>

1173
02:33:43.581 --> 02:33:47.501
<i>I think they were brought
from Bialystok,</i>


1174
02:33:47.585 --> 02:33:50.170
<i>from some Russian bunkers.</i>

1175
02:33:53.841 --> 02:33:55.926
FRANZ SUCHOMEL

1176
02:33:56.010 --> 02:34:00.180
What was the capacity
of the new gas chambers?


1177
02:34:00.264 --> 02:34:02.891
There were <i>2</i> of them, right?
- Yes.


1178
02:34:02.975 --> 02:34:09.148
But the old ones
hadn't been demolished.


1179
02:34:10.649 --> 02:34:14.945
When there were a lot of trains,
a lot of people,


1180
02:34:15.029 --> 02:34:18.574
the old ovens
were put back into service.


1181
02:34:20.409 --> 02:34:25.789
And here... the Jews say
there were 5 on each side.


1182
02:34:26.040 --> 02:34:28.250
I say there were 4,

1183
02:34:28.500 --> 02:34:30.753
but I'm not sure.

1184
02:34:30.836 --> 02:34:34.340
In any case, only the upper row,

1185
02:34:36.050 --> 02:34:37.968
on this side,

1186
02:34:38.844 --> 02:34:41.805
was in action.

1187
02:34:41.889 --> 02:34:44.266
Why not the other side?

1188
02:34:44.350 --> 02:34:51.065
Disposing of the bodies
would have been too complicated.


1189
02:34:51.774 --> 02:34:53.275
- Too far?
- Yes.


1190
02:34:53.359 --> 02:34:59.198
Up there,
Wirth had built the death camp,


1191
02:34:59.740 --> 02:35:06.246
assigning a detail
of Jewish workers to it.


1192
02:35:07.039 --> 02:35:10.668
The detail had a fixed number in it,

1193
02:35:10.751 --> 02:35:13.921
around 200 people,

1194
02:35:17.091 --> 02:35:21.178
who worked only in the death camp.

1195
02:35:21.261 --> 02:35:25.933
But what was the capacity
of the new gas chambers?


1196
02:35:27.101 --> 02:35:30.604
The new gas chambers... Let's see...

1197
02:35:31.438 --> 02:35:36.110
They could finish off 3,000 people
in two hours.


1198
02:35:38.821 --> 02:35:43.826
How many people at once
in a single gas chamber?


1199
02:35:44.118 --> 02:35:47.287
I can't say exactly.

1200
02:35:47.371 --> 02:35:49.748
The Jews say 200.

1201
02:35:50.290 --> 02:35:53.168
- 200?
- That's right, 200.


1202
02:35:54.420 --> 02:36:00.175
Imagine a room this size.

1203
02:36:00.259 --> 02:36:02.386
They put more in at Auschwitz.

1204
02:36:02.636 --> 02:36:05.139
Auschwitz was a factory!

1205
02:36:07.099 --> 02:36:09.393
And Treblinka?

1206
02:36:09.810 --> 02:36:12.813
<i>I'll</i> give you my definition.

1207
02:36:13.647 --> 02:36:15.357
Keep this in mind:

1208
02:36:15.441 --> 02:36:20.988
Treblinka was a primitive,

1209
02:36:21.655 --> 02:36:27.911
but efficient production line of death.

1210
02:36:28.245 --> 02:36:31.039
- A production line?
- Of death.


1211
02:36:31.999 --> 02:36:34.168
Understand?
- Yes.


1212
02:36:38.505 --> 02:36:42.968
But primitive...?
- Primitive, yes.


1213
02:36:43.844 --> 02:36:48.766
But it worked well,
that production line of death.


1214
02:36:49.016 --> 02:36:52.227
Was Belzec even more rudimentary?

1215
02:36:52.311 --> 02:36:55.731
Belzec was the laboratory.

1216
02:36:55.814 --> 02:37:00.194
Wirth was camp commandant.

1217
02:37:01.528 --> 02:37:06.200
He tried everything imaginable there.

1218
02:37:07.201 --> 02:37:10.746
He got off on the wrong foot.

1219
02:37:10.829 --> 02:37:12.831
The pits were overﬂowing,

1220
02:37:12.915 --> 02:37:18.670
and the cesspool seeped out
in front of the SS mess hall.


1221
02:37:18.754 --> 02:37:20.422
It stank...

1222
02:37:21.423 --> 02:37:24.802
in front of the mess-hall,
in front of their barracks.


1223
02:37:25.219 --> 02:37:28.055
- Were you at Belzec?
- No.


1224
02:37:28.680 --> 02:37:31.725
Wirth with his own men.

1225
02:37:32.351 --> 02:37:35.312
With Franz, with Oberhauser

1226
02:37:35.896 --> 02:37:37.648
and Hackenhold...

1227
02:37:37.731 --> 02:37:39.733
he tried everything there.

1228
02:37:40.734 --> 02:37:46.990
Those 3 had to put the bodies
in the pits themselves


1229
02:37:48.033 --> 02:37:53.914
so that Wirth could see
how much space he needed.


1230
02:37:54.915 --> 02:37:58.085
And when they rebelled...

1231
02:37:58.502 --> 02:37:59.711
Franz refused...

1232
02:37:59.795 --> 02:38:02.798
Wirth beat Franz with a whip.

1233
02:38:02.881 --> 02:38:05.634
He whipped Hackenhold, too. You see?

1234
02:38:05.717 --> 02:38:08.136
- Kurt Franz?
- Kurt Franz.


1235
02:38:10.055 --> 02:38:11.557
That's how Wirth was.

1236
02:38:11.640 --> 02:38:15.269
Then, with that experience behind him,

1237
02:38:16.687 --> 02:38:18.272
he came to Treblinka.

1238
02:39:57.996 --> 02:40:05.045
Excuse me. How many quarts
of beer a day do you sell?


1239
02:40:07.839 --> 02:40:10.092
You can't tell me?

1240
02:40:12.219 --> 02:40:15.889
I'd rather not.
I have my reasons.


1241
02:40:16.223 --> 02:40:17.724
But why not?

1242
02:40:18.558 --> 02:40:20.686
<i>Two Pilsners.</i>

1243
02:40:24.856 --> 02:40:31.113
How many quarts of beer a day
do you sell?


1244
02:40:33.198 --> 02:40:35.826
- Go on, tell him.
- Tell him what?


1245
02:40:35.909 --> 02:40:39.079
Just tell him approximately.

1246
02:40:39.329 --> 02:40:42.791
How many quarts of beer a day
do you sell?


1247
02:40:42.874 --> 02:40:44.001
400, 500 quarts.

1248
02:40:44.084 --> 02:40:46.712
- What?
- 400, 500 quarts.


1249
02:40:49.256 --> 02:40:50.799
That's a lot!

1250
02:40:57.264 --> 02:41:00.142
Have you worked here long?

1251
02:41:01.601 --> 02:41:04.396
Around 20 years.

1252
02:41:06.440 --> 02:41:09.735
- Why are you hiding...
- I have my reasons.


1253
02:41:09.818 --> 02:41:12.988
- Your face?
- I have my reasons.


1254
02:41:13.238 --> 02:41:15.157
What reasons?

1255
02:41:17.159 --> 02:41:20.328
- Never mind.
- Why not?


1256
02:41:33.633 --> 02:41:35.802
Do you recognize this man?

1257
02:41:38.346 --> 02:41:39.639
No?

1258
02:41:39.973 --> 02:41:41.767
Christian Wirth?

1259
02:41:41.850 --> 02:41:43.643
Mr. Oberhauser!

1260
02:41:44.144 --> 02:41:46.063
Do you remember Belzec?

1261
02:41:47.355 --> 02:41:49.983
No memories of Belzec?

1262
02:41:57.824 --> 02:42:05.165
Of the overﬂowing graves?

1263
02:42:16.218 --> 02:42:18.178
You don't remember?

1264
02:42:24.351 --> 02:42:29.231
MUNICH

1265
02:42:38.198 --> 02:42:40.659
WUPPERTALI ANTON SPIESS,

1266
02:42:40.867 --> 02:42:45.122
German state prosecutor
at the Treblinka trial (Frankfurt, 1960)


1267
02:42:50.710 --> 02:42:55.924
<i>When the Action itself
first got under way,</i>


1268
02:42:56.007 --> 02:42:59.052
<i>it was almost totally improvised.</i>

1269
02:43:02.222 --> 02:43:06.768
<i>At Treblinka, for example,</i>

1270
02:43:06.852 --> 02:43:11.940
<i>the commandant, Dr. Eberl,
let more trains come in</i>


1271
02:43:12.023 --> 02:43:16.570
<i>than the camp could handle.</i>

1272
02:43:17.195 --> 02:43:19.281
<i>It was a disaster!</i>

1273
02:43:19.364 --> 02:43:21.491
<i>Mountains of corpses!</i>

1274
02:43:22.075 --> 02:43:26.997
<i>Word of this foul-up</i>

1275
02:43:27.080 --> 02:43:31.168
<i>reached the head of the Reinhard Action,</i>

1276
02:43:31.251 --> 02:43:34.671
<i>00770 G/oboczn/k, in Lub//n.</i>

1277
02:43:34.754 --> 02:43:37.549
He went to Treblinka

1278
02:43:37.632 --> 02:43:42.512
to see what was happening.

1279
02:43:42.596 --> 02:43:46.683
There's a very concrete
account of the trip


1280
02:43:46.766 --> 02:43:50.854
by his former driver, Oberhauser.

1281
02:43:50.937 --> 02:43:53.982
Globocznik arrived
on a hot day in August.


1282
02:43:54.065 --> 02:43:59.070
The camp was permeated

1283
02:44:00.071 --> 02:44:03.867
with the stench of rotting ﬂesh.

1284
02:44:03.950 --> 02:44:10.790
Globocznik didn't even bother
to enter the camp.


1285
02:44:10.874 --> 02:44:13.752
He stopped here,
before the commandant's office,


1286
02:44:13.835 --> 02:44:15.921
sent for Dr. Eberl

1287
02:44:16.004 --> 02:44:20.425
and greeted him with these words,

1288
02:44:20.508 --> 02:44:24.638
“How dare you accept
so many every day


1289
02:44:24.721 --> 02:44:27.724
when you can only process 3,000?”

1290
02:44:35.982 --> 02:44:38.735
<i>Operations were suspended,</i>

1291
02:44:39.361 --> 02:44:42.864
<i>Eberl was transferred and Wirth came,</i>

1292
02:44:44.157 --> 02:44:46.910
<i>followed immediately by Stangl,</i>

1293
02:44:48.203 --> 02:44:52.374
<i>and the camp was completely reorganized.</i>

1294
02:45:02.092 --> 02:45:06.221
<i>The Reinhard Action
covered 3 extermination camps."</i>


1295
02:45:06.304 --> 02:45:09.849
<i>Treblinka, Sobibor and Belzec.</i>

1296
02:45:10.225 --> 02:45:15.063
<i>There's also talk of 3 death camps
on the Bug River,</i>


1297
02:45:15.146 --> 02:45:19.359
<i>for they were all located
on or near the Bug.</i>


1298
02:45:23.655 --> 02:45:27.534
<i>The gas chambers
were the heart of the camp.</i>


1299
02:45:29.494 --> 02:45:31.997
<i>They were built first,</i>

1300
02:45:32.372 --> 02:45:36.042
<i>in the woods, or in a field,
as at Treblinka.</i>


1301
02:45:36.710 --> 02:45:41.715
<i>The gas chambers were
the only stone buildings.</i>


1302
02:45:42.507 --> 02:45:46.052
<i>All the others were wooden sheds.</i>

1303
02:45:46.553 --> 02:45:50.056
<i>These camps weren't built to last.</i>

1304
02:45:51.391 --> 02:45:56.146
<i>Himmler was in a huny
to begin the 'final solution.</i> ”


1305
02:45:56.229 --> 02:46:00.525
<i>The Germans had to capitalize
on their eastward advance</i>


1306
02:46:00.608 --> 02:46:02.819
<i>and use this remote back-country</i>

1307
02:46:02.902 --> 02:46:10.285
<i>to carry out their mass murder
as secretly as possible.</i>


1308
02:46:15.373 --> 02:46:17.959
<i>So at first they couldn't
manage the perfection</i>


1309
02:46:18.043 --> 02:46:21.129
<i>they achieved 3 months later.</i>

1310
02:46:38.146 --> 02:46:40.940
<i>Near the end of March 1942,</i>

1311
02:46:47.155 --> 02:46:51.242
<i>sizeable groups of Jews
were herded here,</i>


1312
02:46:51.326 --> 02:46:53.453
<i>groups of 50 to 100 people.</i>

1313
02:46:58.917 --> 02:47:00.960
<i>Several trains arrived</i>

1314
02:47:08.259 --> 02:47:12.222
<i>with sections of barracks,
with posts, barbed wire, bricks...</i>


1315
02:47:19.646 --> 02:47:23.525
<i>and construction
of the camp as such began.</i>


1316
02:47:35.203 --> 02:47:37.497
<i>The Jews unloaded these cars</i>

1317
02:47:42.335 --> 02:47:45.672
<i>and carted the sections
of barracks to the camp.</i>


1318
02:47:54.848 --> 02:47:58.601
<i>The Germans made them
work extremely fast.</i>


1319
02:48:09.821 --> 02:48:13.366
<i>When we saw the pace they worked at...</i>

1320
02:48:21.708 --> 02:48:24.085
<i>It was extremely brutal.</i>

1321
02:48:32.594 --> 02:48:36.806
<i>When we saw the complex being built,
and the fence,</i>


1322
02:48:37.056 --> 02:48:40.143
<i>which, after all, enclosed a vast space,</i>

1323
02:48:48.193 --> 02:48:52.197
<i>we realized that
what the Germans were building</i>


1324
02:48:52.280 --> 02:48:54.991
<i>wasn't meant to aid mankind.</i>

1325
02:49:05.251 --> 02:49:07.545
<i>Early in June,</i>

1326
02:49:14.594 --> 02:49:16.763
<i>the first convoy arrived.</i>

1327
02:49:20.350 --> 02:49:22.936
<i>I'd say there were over 40 cars.</i>

1328
02:49:28.900 --> 02:49:32.654
<i>With the convoy
were SS men in black uniforms.</i>


1329
02:49:37.116 --> 02:49:40.912
<i>It happened one afternoon.
He had just finished work.</i>


1330
02:49:40.995 --> 02:49:45.166
JAN PIWONSKI

1331
02:49:45.667 --> 02:49:48.962
But he got on
his bicycle and went home.

1332
02:49:50.046 --> 02:49:51.464
Why?

1333
02:50:03.518 --> 02:50:05.353
I merely thought

1334
02:50:06.187 --> 02:50:09.899
these people had come to build the camp,

1335
02:50:10.608 --> 02:50:12.652
as the others had before them.

1336
02:50:14.362 --> 02:50:15.989
That convoy...

1337
02:50:17.532 --> 02:50:20.994
There was no way
of knowing that it was...


1338
02:50:24.998 --> 02:50:27.166
the first earmarked for extermination.

1339
02:50:28.585 --> 02:50:30.169
Besides,

1340
02:50:31.170 --> 02:50:34.507
he couldn't have known that Sobibor

1341
02:50:36.175 --> 02:50:40.847
would be a place for the mass
extermination of the Jews.


1342
02:50:51.274 --> 02:50:55.737
The next morning,
when I came here to work,


1343
02:50:55.987 --> 02:51:00.033
the station was absolutely silent,

1344
02:51:24.682 --> 02:51:29.103
and we realized,

1345
02:51:29.187 --> 02:51:34.901
after talking with the Poles
who worked at the station here,


1346
02:51:36.736 --> 02:51:41.449
that something utterly
incomprehensible had happened.


1347
02:51:47.580 --> 02:51:50.416
First of all, when the camp
was being built,


1348
02:51:56.589 --> 02:51:58.841
there were orders shouted in German,

1349
02:51:59.300 --> 02:52:01.010
there were screams,

1350
02:52:02.220 --> 02:52:05.973
Jews were working at the run,
there were shots,


1351
02:52:06.808 --> 02:52:09.936
and here there was that silence,

1352
02:52:15.274 --> 02:52:17.276
no work crews,

1353
02:52:20.780 --> 02:52:22.949
a really total silence.

1354
02:52:31.165 --> 02:52:34.961
40 cars had arrived,
and then... nothing.


1355
02:52:35.169 --> 02:52:37.964
It was all very strange.

1356
02:52:39.298 --> 02:52:41.551
<i>It was the silence that tipped them off?</i>

1357
02:52:41.634 --> 02:52:42.885
<i>That's right.</i>

1358
02:52:42.969 --> 02:52:44.971
<i>Can he describe that silence?</i>

1359
02:52:47.640 --> 02:52:49.475
<i>It was a silence...</i>

1360
02:52:50.601 --> 02:52:54.731
<i>Nothing was going on in the camp.
You heard nothing.</i>


1361
02:52:54.814 --> 02:52:56.649
<i>Nothing moved.</i>

1362
02:53:03.489 --> 02:53:06.492
<i>So then they began to wonder,</i>

1363
02:53:09.912 --> 02:53:13.207
<i>“Where have they put those Jews?”</i>

1364
02:53:17.920 --> 02:53:22.842
<i>Cell 13, Block 11 at Auschwitz 1,</i>

1365
02:53:22.925 --> 02:53:26.345
<i>is where
the Special Work Detail was held.</i>


1366
02:53:28.431 --> 02:53:32.018
<i>The cell was underground, isolated.</i>

1367
02:53:32.977 --> 02:53:36.397
<i>For we were...</i>

1368
02:53:37.940 --> 02:53:39.984
<i>“bearers of secrets,”</i>

1369
02:53:41.486 --> 02:53:43.863
<i>we were reprieved dead men.</i>

1370
02:53:45.865 --> 02:53:48.993
<i>We weren't allowed to talk to anyone,</i>

1371
02:53:49.202 --> 02:53:51.996
<i>or contact any prisoner,</i>

1372
02:53:52.538 --> 02:53:55.458
<i>even the SS.</i>

1373
02:53:55.708 --> 02:53:59.921
<i>Only those in charge of the “Action.”</i>

1374
02:54:03.925 --> 02:54:06.052
<i>There was a window.</i>

1375
02:54:06.886 --> 02:54:10.515
<i>We heard what happened in the courtyard.</i>

1376
02:54:12.225 --> 02:54:14.477
<i>The executions,</i>

1377
02:54:15.520 --> 02:54:18.773
<i>the victims' cries, the screams,</i>

1378
02:54:19.482 --> 02:54:21.651
<i>but we couldn't see anything.</i>

1379
02:54:27.532 --> 02:54:30.117
<i>This went on for several days.</i>

1380
02:54:31.494 --> 02:54:35.581
<i>One night an SS man came</i>

1381
02:54:36.499 --> 02:54:38.709
<i>from the political section.</i>

1382
02:54:40.503 --> 02:54:46.217
<i>It was around 4 A.M.</i>

1383
02:54:50.429 --> 02:54:55.726
<i>The whole camp was still asleep.</i>

1384
02:54:58.271 --> 02:55:01.148
<i>There wasn't a sound in the camp.</i>

1385
02:55:09.615 --> 02:55:14.871
<i>We were again taken out of our cell</i>

1386
02:55:16.914 --> 02:55:19.792
<i>and led to the crematorium.</i>

1387
02:55:25.172 --> 02:55:29.051
<i>There, for the first time,
I saw the procedure used</i>


1388
02:55:29.135 --> 02:55:33.264
<i>with those who came in alive.</i>

1389
02:55:34.390 --> 02:55:36.559
<i>We were lined up against a wall</i>

1390
02:55:36.642 --> 02:55:40.521
<i>and told, “No one may talk
to those people.”</i>


1391
02:55:44.483 --> 02:55:49.572
<i>Suddenly, the wooden door
to the crematorium courtyard opened,</i>


1392
02:55:49.655 --> 02:55:55.453
<i>and 250 to 300 people filed in:</i>

1393
02:55:55.536 --> 02:55:58.831
<i>old people, and women.</i>

1394
02:56:01.167 --> 02:56:04.962
<i>They carried bundles,
wore the Star of David.</i>


1395
02:56:06.964 --> 02:56:09.675
<i>Even from a distance, 
I could tell</i>

1396
02:56:09.759 --> 02:56:13.304
<i>they were Polish Jews,</i>

1397
02:56:14.889 --> 02:56:18.476
<i>probably from Upper Silesia,</i>

1398
02:56:18.684 --> 02:56:23.689
<i>from the Sosnowiec ghetto,
some 20 miles from Auschwitz.</i>


1399
02:56:25.900 --> 02:56:27.276
FILIP MULLER

1400
02:56:27.360 --> 02:56:32.573
I caught some of the things they said.

1401
02:56:33.699 --> 02:56:35.534
I heard “fachowitz,”

1402
02:56:35.618 --> 02:56:38.037
meaning “skilled worker.”

1403
02:56:38.454 --> 02:56:41.374
And “Malach-ha
-Mavis,”

1404
02:56:42.124 --> 02:56:45.169
which means
“the angel of death” in Yiddish.


1405
02:56:47.964 --> 02:56:51.258
Also, “harginnen”:
“They're going to kill us.”


1406
02:56:54.720 --> 02:56:58.641
From what I could hear,

1407
02:56:58.891 --> 02:57:03.145
I clearly understood
the struggle going on inside them.


1408
02:57:03.396 --> 02:57:05.648
Sometimes they spoke of work

1409
02:57:05.731 --> 02:57:10.236
probably hoping
that they'd be put to work.


1410
02:57:11.404 --> 02:57:15.741
Or they spoke of “Malach-ha-Mavis,”
the angel of death.


1411
02:57:17.326 --> 02:57:21.580
The conﬂicting words echoed
the conﬂict in their feelings.


1412
02:57:22.331 --> 02:57:25.876
Then a sudden silence

1413
02:57:26.419 --> 02:57:30.673
fell over those gathered
in the crematorium courtyard.


1414
02:57:33.300 --> 02:57:36.429
<i>All eyes converged</i>

1415
02:57:37.179 --> 02:57:40.725
<i>on the ﬂat roof of the crematorium.</i>

1416
02:57:44.437 --> 02:57:46.522
<i>Who was standing there?</i>

1417
02:57:46.605 --> 02:57:48.941
<i>Aumeyer, of the SS,</i>

1418
02:57:49.859 --> 02:57:52.653
<i>Grabner,
the head of the political section,</i>


1419
02:57:53.237 --> 02:57:55.948
<i>and Hossler, the SS officer.</i>

1420
02:57:57.074 --> 02:58:00.453
<i>Aumeyer addressed the crowd,</i>

1421
02:58:02.413 --> 02:58:06.042
<i>“You're here to work,</i>

1422
02:58:06.125 --> 02:58:11.047
<i>for our soldiers fighting at the front.</i>

1423
02:58:13.299 --> 02:58:16.260
Those who can work will be all right.”

1424
02:58:17.470 --> 02:58:25.061
it was obvious
that hope ﬂared in those people.


1425
02:58:25.144 --> 02:58:29.148
You could feel it clearly.

1426
02:58:30.399 --> 02:58:33.986
The executioners had gotten
past the first obstacle.


1427
02:58:34.987 --> 02:58:38.449
They saw it was succeeding.

1428
02:58:40.326 --> 02:58:42.661
Then Grabner spoke up,

1429
02:58:43.996 --> 02:58:48.667
“We need masons, electricians,

1430
02:58:49.335 --> 02:58:51.545
all the trades.”

1431
02:58:52.505 --> 02:58:56.842
Next, Hossler took over.

1432
02:58:58.010 --> 02:59:02.681
He pointed to a
short man in the crowd.

1433
02:59:02.765 --> 02:59:04.850
I can still see him.

1434
02:59:04.934 --> 02:59:06.769
“What's your trade?”

1435
02:59:06.852 --> 02:59:08.270
The man said,

1436
02:59:08.354 --> 02:59:11.690
“Mr. Officer, 
I'm a tailor.”

1437
02:59:12.483 --> 02:59:16.028
“A tailor? What kind of tailor?”

1438
02:59:17.238 --> 02:59:21.534
“A man's... No, for both men and women.”

1439
02:59:21.617 --> 02:59:26.872
“Wonderful! We need people
like you in our workshops.”


1440
02:59:29.041 --> 02:59:32.044
<i>Then he questioned a woman,</i>

1441
02:59:32.795 --> 02:59:35.464
<i>“What's your trade?”</i>

1442
02:59:36.090 --> 02:59:38.634
<i>“Nurse,” she replied.</i>

1443
02:59:38.717 --> 02:59:45.224
<i>“Splendid! We need nurses
in our hospitals for our soldiers.</i>


1444
02:59:45.558 --> 02:59:49.937
<i>We need all of you!
But first, undress.</i>


1445
02:59:50.813 --> 02:59:53.732
<i>You must be disinfected.</i>

1446
02:59:53.941 --> 02:59:57.153
<i>We want you healthy.”</i>

1447
02:59:59.655 --> 03:00:03.033
<i>I could see the people were calmer,</i>

1448
03:00:03.659 --> 03:00:07.913
<i>reassured by what they'd heard,</i>

1449
03:00:08.622 --> 03:00:11.750
<i>and they began to undress.</i>

1450
03:00:13.627 --> 03:00:16.088
<i>Even if they still had their doubts,</i>

1451
03:00:16.922 --> 03:00:19.925
<i>if you want to live, you must hope.</i>

1452
03:00:25.556 --> 03:00:29.143
<i>Their clothing remained
in the courtyard,</i>


1453
03:00:29.977 --> 03:00:32.646
<i>scattered everywhere.</i>

1454
03:00:33.856 --> 03:00:36.525
<i>Aumeyer was beaming,</i>

1455
03:00:36.609 --> 03:00:40.529
<i>very proud of how he'd handled things.</i>

1456
03:00:40.613 --> 03:00:45.159
<i>He turned to some of the SS men
and told them,</i>


1457
03:00:45.242 --> 03:00:48.412
<i>“You see? 
That's the way to do it!”</i>

1458
03:00:49.872 --> 03:00:51.999
<i>By this device,</i>

1459
03:00:52.249 --> 03:00:58.297
<i>a great leap fon/vard had been made:</i>

1460
03:00:58.923 --> 03:01:02.301
<i>Now the clothing could be used.</i>

1461
03:01:06.472 --> 03:01:09.767
RAUL H I LBERG, historian

1462
03:11:45.318 --> 03:11:48.446
FRANZ SCHALLING

1463
03:11:53.618 --> 03:11:57.122
<i>First, explain to me...</i>

1464
03:11:57.581 --> 03:12:02.002
<i>how you came to Kulmhof, to Chelmno.</i>

1465
03:12:02.794 --> 03:12:04.880
<i>You were at Lodz, right?</i>

1466
03:12:05.213 --> 03:12:07.048
<i>In Lodz, yes.</i>

1467
03:12:07.132 --> 03:12:08.842
<i>In Litzmannstadt.</i>

1468
03:12:09.467 --> 03:12:13.972
<i>We were on permanent guard duty.</i>

1469
03:12:14.806 --> 03:12:17.434
<i>Protecting military objectives: mills,</i>

1470
03:12:17.934 --> 03:12:21.563
<i>the roads,
when Hitler went to East Prussia.</i>


1471
03:12:22.272 --> 03:12:25.150
<i>It was dreary, and we were told,</i>

1472
03:12:25.483 --> 03:12:30.947
<i>“We're looking for men who want
to break out of this routine.”</i>


1473
03:12:31.031 --> 03:12:33.199
<i>So we volunteered.</i>

1474
03:12:34.826 --> 03:12:37.537
<i>We were issued winter uniforms,</i>

1475
03:12:37.996 --> 03:12:42.417
<i>overcoats, fur hats, fur-lined boots,</i>

1476
03:12:43.293 --> 03:12:47.839
<i>and 2 or 3 days later
we were told, “We're off!”</i>


1477
03:12:48.840 --> 03:12:52.427
<i>We were put aboard 2 or 3 trucks...
I don't know...</i>


1478
03:12:52.510 --> 03:12:56.765
<i>They had benches,</i>

1479
03:12:57.432 --> 03:12:59.267
<i>and we rode and rode.</i>

1480
03:12:59.517 --> 03:13:02.020
<i>Finally we arrived.</i>

1481
03:13:03.855 --> 03:13:07.317
<i>The place was crawling
with SS men and police.</i>


1482
03:13:07.400 --> 03:13:11.196
<i>Our first question was,
“What goes on here?”</i>


1483
03:13:11.696 --> 03:13:14.658
<i>They said, “You'll find out!”</i>

1484
03:13:14.741 --> 03:13:17.911
<i>- You'll find out?
- You'll find out.</i>


1485
03:13:20.038 --> 03:13:23.375
<i>- You weren't in the SS, you were...
- Police.</i>


1486
03:13:23.458 --> 03:13:27.128
- <i>Which police ?</i>
- <i>Security guards.</i>


1487
03:13:27.921 --> 03:13:32.175
We were ordered
to report to the Deutsche Haus,


1488
03:13:32.258 --> 03:13:36.388
the only big stone building
in the village.


1489
03:13:37.514 --> 03:13:39.474
We were taken into it.

1490
03:13:40.517 --> 03:13:42.852
An SS man immediately told us,

1491
03:13:42.936 --> 03:13:46.022
“This is a top secret mission!”

1492
03:13:46.231 --> 03:13:48.817
- Secret?
- “A top secret mission.”


1493
03:13:48.900 --> 03:13:50.485
“Sign this!”

1494
03:13:50.568 --> 03:13:52.570
We each had to sign.

1495
03:13:52.654 --> 03:13:56.449
There was a form
ready for each of us.

1496
03:13:59.411 --> 03:14:01.705
What did it say?

1497
03:14:01.788 --> 03:14:05.000
It was a pledge of secrecy.

1498
03:14:05.083 --> 03:14:07.836
We never even got to read it through.

1499
03:14:07.919 --> 03:14:10.213
You had to take an oath?

1500
03:14:10.296 --> 03:14:13.258
No, just sign,

1501
03:14:13.925 --> 03:14:17.012
promising to shut up
about whatever we'd see.


1502
03:14:17.095 --> 03:14:19.723
- Shut up?
- Not say a word.


1503
03:14:20.390 --> 03:14:24.519
After we'd signed, we were told,

1504
03:14:25.103 --> 03:14:26.896
“Final solution of the Jewish question.”

1505
03:14:26.980 --> 03:14:30.984
We didn't understand what that meant.

1506
03:14:31.067 --> 03:14:32.861
So someone said...

1507
03:14:32.944 --> 03:14:36.072
He told us what was going
to happen there.


1508
03:14:36.156 --> 03:14:39.993
Someone said, “the final solution
of the Jewish question.”


1509
03:14:40.076 --> 03:14:44.414
You'd be assigned to the “final solution”?

1510
03:14:44.497 --> 03:14:47.292
Yes, but what did that mean?

1511
03:14:47.375 --> 03:14:49.461
We'd never heard that before.

1512
03:14:49.669 --> 03:14:51.713
So it was explained to us.

1513
03:14:51.796 --> 03:14:54.007
Just when was this?

1514
03:14:54.090 --> 03:14:56.634
Let's see... when was it...?

1515
03:14:57.969 --> 03:15:00.972
<i>In the winter of 1941-42.</i>

1516
03:15:07.353 --> 03:15:10.356
<i>Then we were assigned to our stations.</i>

1517
03:15:10.607 --> 03:15:14.235
<i>Our guard post was
at the side of the road.</i>


1518
03:15:14.611 --> 03:15:17.363
<i>A sentry box in front of the castle.</i>

1519
03:15:17.822 --> 03:15:21.493
<i>So you were in the “castle detail”?</i>

1520
03:15:24.329 --> 03:15:26.206
<i>That's right.</i>

1521
03:15:27.373 --> 03:15:31.336
<i>Can you describe what you saw?</i>

1522
03:15:32.796 --> 03:15:35.924
<i>We could see.
We were at the gatehouse.</i>


1523
03:15:36.841 --> 03:15:41.554
<i>When the Jews arrived,
the way they looked:</i>


1524
03:15:41.638 --> 03:15:46.142
<i>half-frozen, starved, dirty,
already half-dead.</i>


1525
03:15:46.226 --> 03:15:49.062
<i>Old people, children.</i>

1526
03:15:50.188 --> 03:15:55.568
<i>Think of it! The long trip here
standing in a truck, packed in!</i>


1527
03:15:57.195 --> 03:16:00.156
<i>Who knows if they knew
what was in store!</i>


1528
03:16:00.907 --> 03:16:03.326
<i>They didn't trust anyone,
that's for sure.</i>


1529
03:16:03.409 --> 03:16:06.621
<i>After months in the ghetto,
you can imagine!</i>


1530
03:16:09.582 --> 03:16:12.335
<i>I heard an SS man shout at them,</i>

1531
03:16:12.544 --> 03:16:15.088
<i>“You're going to be deloused</i>

1532
03:16:15.880 --> 03:16:18.216
<i>and have a bath.</i>

1533
03:16:18.716 --> 03:16:20.718
<i>You're going to work here.”</i>

1534
03:16:21.219 --> 03:16:24.514
<i>The Jews consented.</i>

1535
03:16:24.597 --> 03:16:27.892
<i>They said,
“Yes, that's what we want to do.”</i>


1536
03:16:29.561 --> 03:16:31.980
<i>Was the castle big?</i>

1537
03:16:33.439 --> 03:16:36.401
<i>Pretty big, with huge front steps.</i>

1538
03:16:36.484 --> 03:16:41.322
<i>The SS man stood at
the top of the steps.</i>

1539
03:16:42.740 --> 03:16:45.201
<i>Then what happened?</i>

1540
03:16:45.577 --> 03:16:50.331
<i>They were hustled into

1541
03:16:50.957 --> 03:16:54.335
<i>They had to undress, give up everything:</i>

1542
03:16:54.419 --> 03:16:57.088
<i>rings, gold, everything.</i>

1543
03:16:59.924 --> 03:17:03.303
<i>How long did the Jews stay there?</i>

1544
03:17:03.761 --> 03:17:06.181
<i>Long enough to undress.</i>

1545
03:17:06.639 --> 03:17:09.058
<i>Then, stark naked,</i>

1546
03:17:09.142 --> 03:17:13.354
<i>they had to run down more steps</i>

1547
03:17:14.439 --> 03:17:16.524
<i>to an underground corridor</i>

1548
03:17:17.609 --> 03:17:21.279
<i>that led back up to the ramp,
where the gas van awaited them.</i>


1549
03:17:23.406 --> 03:17:27.827
<i>Did the Jews enter the van willingly?</i>

1550
03:17:29.454 --> 03:17:31.831
<i>No, they were beaten.</i>

1551
03:17:32.332 --> 03:17:36.377
<i>Blows fell everywhere,
and the Jews understood.</i>


1552
03:17:36.461 --> 03:17:38.004
<i>They screamed.</i>

1553
03:17:38.338 --> 03:17:40.215
<i>It was frightful!</i>

1554
03:17:40.965 --> 03:17:42.717
<i>F rightful!</i>

1555
03:17:44.802 --> 03:17:47.764
<i>I know, because
we went down to the cellar</i>


1556
03:17:47.847 --> 03:17:50.099
<i>when they were all in the van.</i>

1557
03:17:50.183 --> 03:17:56.064
<i>We opened the cells of the work detail,</i>

1558
03:17:56.147 --> 03:17:58.483
<i>the Jewish workers</i>

1559
03:17:58.566 --> 03:18:03.154
<i>who collected the things thrown out
of the 1st-ﬂoor window into there.</i>


1560
03:18:05.323 --> 03:18:07.742
<i>Describe the gas vans.</i>

1561
03:18:08.910 --> 03:18:11.079
<i>Like moving vans.</i>

1562
03:18:11.454 --> 03:18:13.373
<i>Very big?</i>

1563
03:18:13.456 --> 03:18:15.875
<i>They stretched, say,</i>

1564
03:18:16.167 --> 03:18:18.753
<i>from here to the window.</i>

1565
03:18:18.836 --> 03:18:20.922
<i>Just big trucks,</i>

1566
03:18:21.005 --> 03:18:24.342
<i>like moving vans, with 2 rear doors.</i>

1567
03:18:27.178 --> 03:18:29.722
What system was used?

1568
03:18:29.806 --> 03:18:33.851
How did they kill them?

1569
03:18:34.185 --> 03:18:37.355
- With exhaust fumes.
- Exhaust fumes?


1570
03:18:37.855 --> 03:18:42.986
It went like this:
A Pole yelled, “Gas!”


1571
03:18:43.069 --> 03:18:48.324
Then the driver got under the van
to hook up the pipe


1572
03:18:49.367 --> 03:18:54.455
that fed the gas into the van.

1573
03:18:54.539 --> 03:18:57.667
- Yes, but how?
- From the motor.


1574
03:18:57.750 --> 03:19:00.128
Yes, but through what?

1575
03:19:00.211 --> 03:19:02.505
A pipe... a tube.

1576
03:19:02.588 --> 03:19:05.425
He fiddled around under the truck.

1577
03:19:05.508 --> 03:19:07.719
I'm not sure how.

1578
03:19:08.803 --> 03:19:11.764
It was just exhaust gas?

1579
03:19:12.765 --> 03:19:14.475
That's all.

1580
03:19:18.229 --> 03:19:20.565
Who were the drivers?

1581
03:19:22.233 --> 03:19:23.943
SS men.

1582
03:19:24.027 --> 03:19:27.196
All those men were SS.

1583
03:19:27.280 --> 03:19:30.366
Were there many of these drivers?

1584
03:19:30.575 --> 03:19:32.118
I don't know.

1585
03:19:32.201 --> 03:19:34.829
Were there 2, 3, 5, 10?

1586
03:19:35.288 --> 03:19:38.750
Not that many.
<i>2</i> or 3, that's all.


1587
03:19:38.833 --> 03:19:41.252
I think there were <i>2</i> vans,

1588
03:19:41.878 --> 03:19:45.465
one big, one smaller.

1589
03:19:47.258 --> 03:19:51.929
Did the driver sit
in the cabin of the van?


1590
03:19:52.430 --> 03:19:54.349
- Mrs. Uwe?
- No.


1591
03:19:55.433 --> 03:19:59.937
He climbed into the cabin
after the doors were closed


1592
03:20:00.605 --> 03:20:02.899
and started the motor.

1593
03:20:03.524 --> 03:20:07.612
Did he race the motor?

1594
03:20:09.072 --> 03:20:11.783
I don't know.

1595
03:20:12.658 --> 03:20:17.330
Could you hear the sound of the motor?

1596
03:20:18.289 --> 03:20:22.377
Yes, from the gate
we could hear it turn over.


1597
03:20:22.460 --> 03:20:26.506
Was it a loud noise?

1598
03:20:26.589 --> 03:20:30.635
The noise of a truck engine.

1599
03:20:34.013 --> 03:20:38.184
The van was stationary
while the motor ran?


1600
03:20:39.352 --> 03:20:41.312
That's right.

1601
03:20:42.855 --> 03:20:45.650
Then it started moving.

1602
03:20:46.109 --> 03:20:50.238
We opened the gate,
and it headed for the woods.


1603
03:20:50.780 --> 03:20:53.366
Were the people already dead?

1604
03:20:53.449 --> 03:20:55.243
I don't know.

1605
03:20:55.535 --> 03:20:58.121
It was quiet. No more screams.

1606
03:20:58.413 --> 03:20:59.414
No screams.

1607
03:20:59.497 --> 03:21:02.667
You couldn't hear anything
as they drove by.


1608
03:21:16.389 --> 03:21:20.560
<i>He recalls: It was 1941,

1609
03:21:24.355 --> 03:21:26.941
<i>They were routed out at night,</i>

1610
03:21:30.153 --> 03:21:33.531
<i>and in the morning they reached Chelmno.</i>

1611
03:21:39.829 --> 03:21:42.039
<i>There was a castle there.</i>

1612
03:21:50.673 --> 03:21:53.050
<i>When he entered the castle courtyard,</i>

1613
03:21:55.011 --> 03:21:57.597
<i>he knew something awful was going on.</i>

1614
03:21:59.223 --> 03:22:01.309
<i>He already understood.</i>

1615
03:22:01.684 --> 03:22:03.728
THE SITE OF THE CASTLE

1616
03:22:08.065 --> 03:22:11.402
<i>They saw clothes and shoes</i>

1617
03:22:13.571 --> 03:22:15.740
<i>scattered in the courtyard.</i>

1618
03:22:20.244 --> 03:22:23.331
<i>Yet they were alone there.</i>

1619
03:22:23.748 --> 03:22:26.125
<i>He knew his parents
had been through there,</i>


1620
03:22:27.460 --> 03:22:30.671
<i>and there wasn't a Jew left.</i>

1621
03:22:36.260 --> 03:22:38.971
<i>They were taken down into a cellar.</i>

1622
03:22:43.601 --> 03:22:48.147
<i>On a wall was written,
“No one leaves here alive.”</i>


1623
03:22:49.273 --> 03:22:51.317
<i>Graffiti in Yiddish.</i>

1624
03:22:52.777 --> 03:22:55.112
<i>There were lots of names.</i>

1625
03:22:56.614 --> 03:23:00.368
<i>He thinks it was the Jews
from villages around Chelmno</i>


1626
03:23:00.451 --> 03:23:04.121
<i>who had come before him,
who had written their names.</i>


1627
03:23:13.923 --> 03:23:16.133
<i>A few days after New Year's,</i>

1628
03:23:18.803 --> 03:23:22.139
<i>the y heard people arrive
in a truck one morning.</i>


1629
03:23:23.641 --> 03:23:26.143
<i>The people were taken
out of the truck</i>


1630
03:23:28.312 --> 03:23:32.608
<i>and up to the
first ﬂoor of the castle.</i>

1631
03:23:33.484 --> 03:23:37.655
<i>The Germans lied,
saying they were to be deloused.</i>


1632
03:23:43.703 --> 03:23:46.914
<i>They were chased down the other side,</i>

1633
03:23:48.833 --> 03:23:50.751
<i>where a van was waiting.</i>

1634
03:23:57.049 --> 03:24:02.221
<i>The Germans pushed
and beat them with their weapons</i>


1635
03:24:02.513 --> 03:24:05.224
<i>to hustle them into the trucks faster.</i>

1636
03:24:22.992 --> 03:24:26.787
<i>He heard people praying, “Shma Israel, ”</i>

1637
03:24:29.957 --> 03:24:32.877
<i>and he heard
the van's rear doors being shut.</i>


1638
03:24:37.882 --> 03:24:40.051
<i>Their screams were heard,</i>

1639
03:24:40.259 --> 03:24:43.387
<i>becoming fainter and fainter,</i>

1640
03:24:46.140 --> 03:24:50.102
<i>and when there was total silence,</i>

1641
03:24:50.353 --> 03:24:52.438
<i>the van left.</i>

1642
03:25:06.035 --> 03:25:11.082
<i>He and the 4 others
were brought out of the cellar.</i>


1643
03:25:11.165 --> 03:25:13.250
<i>They went upstairs</i>

1644
03:25:22.426 --> 03:25:26.180
<i>and gathered up
the clothes remaining</i>


1645
03:25:26.472 --> 03:25:28.974
<i>outside the supposed baths.</i>

1646
03:25:38.442 --> 03:25:40.945
Did he understand then how they'd died?

1647
03:25:41.404 --> 03:25:43.614
MICHAEL PODCHLEBNIK,

1648
03:25:43.906 --> 03:25:48.869
the survivor of the 1st period
of extermination at Chelmno


1649
03:25:49.161 --> 03:25:51.455
(the castle period)

1650
03:25:58.129 --> 03:26:03.050
<i>Yes, first because
there had been rumors of it.</i>


1651
03:26:03.134 --> 03:26:06.303
<i>And when he went out,
he saw the sealed vans,</i>


1652
03:26:07.471 --> 03:26:08.764
<i>so he knew.</i>

1653
03:26:08.848 --> 03:26:14.645
He understood that people
were gassed in the vans?


1654
03:26:28.951 --> 03:26:31.912
<i>Yes, because he'd heard the screams</i>

1655
03:26:31.996 --> 03:26:34.999
<i>and heard how they weakened,</i>

1656
03:26:36.000 --> 03:26:40.421
<i>and later the vans
were taken into the woods.</i>


1657
03:26:40.713 --> 03:26:42.757
What were the vans like?

1658
03:27:10.910 --> 03:27:15.915
<i>Like the ones
that deliver cigarettes here.</i>


1659
03:27:16.415 --> 03:27:20.044
<i>They were enclosed,
with double-leaf rear doors.</i>


1660
03:27:20.127 --> 03:27:21.962
What color?

1661
03:27:27.843 --> 03:27:31.889
<i>The color the Germans used,
green, ordinary.</i>


1662
03:27:34.809 --> 03:27:36.393
MARTHA MICHELSOHN

1663
03:27:36.602 --> 03:27:42.608
How many German families
were there in Kulmhof (Chelmno)?


1664
03:27:42.691 --> 03:27:45.903
10 or 11, I'd say.

1665
03:27:47.988 --> 03:27:52.493
Germans from Volhynia
and <i>2</i> families from the Reich,


1666
03:27:52.576 --> 03:27:55.079
the Bauers and us.

1667
03:27:55.955 --> 03:27:58.249
- And you?
- Us, the Michelsohns.


1668
03:27:59.208 --> 03:28:03.254
How did you wind up in Kulmhof?

1669
03:28:06.549 --> 03:28:08.342
I was born in Laage,

1670
03:28:08.425 --> 03:28:12.179
and I was sent to Kulmhof.

1671
03:28:12.596 --> 03:28:18.018
They were looking for volunteer settlers,

1672
03:28:18.435 --> 03:28:20.229
and I signed up.

1673
03:28:20.312 --> 03:28:22.481
That's how I got there.

1674
03:28:22.731 --> 03:28:25.276
<i>First 'm Wafihbrucken (Ken),</i>

1675
03:28:25.609 --> 03:28:29.530
then Chelmno... Kulmhof.

1676
03:28:29.822 --> 03:28:32.032
Directly from Laage?

1677
03:28:32.116 --> 03:28:38.706
No, I left from Munster.

1678
03:28:38.789 --> 03:28:42.585
Did you opt to go to Kulmhof?

1679
03:28:42.668 --> 03:28:45.546
No, I asked for Wartheland.

1680
03:28:45.629 --> 03:28:46.964
Why?

1681
03:28:50.009 --> 03:28:52.303
A pioneering spirit.

1682
03:28:53.721 --> 03:28:57.725
- You were young!
- Oh, yes, I was young.


1683
03:28:57.808 --> 03:29:01.312
- You wanted to be useful?
- Yes.


1684
03:29:02.605 --> 03:29:08.152
What was your first impression
of Wartheland?


1685
03:29:08.819 --> 03:29:12.197
It was primitive. 
Super-primitive.

1686
03:29:12.281 --> 03:29:13.908
Meaning...?

1687
03:29:13.991 --> 03:29:15.910
Even worse,

1688
03:29:16.535 --> 03:29:18.454
worse than primitive.

1689
03:29:18.537 --> 03:29:21.832
Difficult to understand, right?

1690
03:29:24.376 --> 03:29:25.586
But why. . .?

1691
03:29:25.669 --> 03:29:30.841
The sanitary facilities were disastrous.

1692
03:29:31.133 --> 03:29:35.471
The only toilet was
in WarthbrUcken, in the town.


1693
03:29:35.554 --> 03:29:37.222
You had to go there.

1694
03:29:37.306 --> 03:29:41.769
The rest was a disaster.

1695
03:29:43.354 --> 03:29:47.399
- Why a disaster?
- There were no toilets at all!


1696
03:29:51.195 --> 03:29:54.198
There were privies.

1697
03:29:55.032 --> 03:29:57.409
I can't tell you

1698
03:29:58.035 --> 03:30:01.080
how primitive it was.

1699
03:30:02.998 --> 03:30:04.124
Astonishing!

1700
03:30:04.208 --> 03:30:09.129
Why did you choose
such a primitive place?


1701
03:30:09.213 --> 03:30:12.800
I was young, you know.

1702
03:30:12.883 --> 03:30:15.719
You can't imagine such places exist.

1703
03:30:15.803 --> 03:30:18.806
You don't believe it.
But that's how it was.


1704
03:30:23.727 --> 03:30:25.896
<i>This was the whole village.</i>

1705
03:30:26.730 --> 03:30:29.108
<i>A very small village,</i>

1706
03:30:31.527 --> 03:30:33.362
<i>straggling along the road.</i>

1707
03:30:33.445 --> 03:30:36.740
<i>Just a few houses.</i>

1708
03:30:38.283 --> 03:30:42.329
<i>There was the church, the castle,</i>

1709
03:30:42.413 --> 03:30:44.748
<i>a store, too,</i>

1710
03:30:45.082 --> 03:30:48.419
<i>the administrative building
and the school.</i>


1711
03:30:49.628 --> 03:30:52.381
<i>The castle was next to the church,</i>

1712
03:30:52.464 --> 03:30:55.926
<i>with a high board fence around both.</i>

1713
03:31:00.597 --> 03:31:04.601
<i>How far was your house from the church?</i>

1714
03:31:05.310 --> 03:31:09.106
<i>It was just opposite... 150 feet.</i>

1715
03:31:10.107 --> 03:31:13.694
Mrs. Michelsohn
was the Nazi teacher's wife


1716
03:31:16.280 --> 03:31:18.657
<i>Did you see the gas vans?</i>

1717
03:31:18.741 --> 03:31:19.867
No...

1718
03:31:20.367 --> 03:31:23.746
<i>Yes, from the outside.
They shuttled back and forth.</i>


1719
03:31:23.829 --> 03:31:28.125
<i>I never looked inside...
I didn't see Jews in them.</i>


1720
03:31:29.793 --> 03:31:31.920
<i>I only saw things from outside,</i>

1721
03:31:32.004 --> 03:31:35.466
<i>the Jews' arrival, their disposition,</i>

1722
03:31:36.008 --> 03:31:39.136
<i>how they were loaded aboard.</i>

1723
03:31:42.639 --> 03:31:44.600
<i>Since World War I,</i>

1724
03:31:44.683 --> 03:31:48.395
<i>the castle had been in ruins.</i>

1725
03:31:49.772 --> 03:31:52.983
<i>Only part of it could still be used.</i>

1726
03:31:53.984 --> 03:31:59.031
<i>That's where the Jews were taken.</i>

1727
03:32:05.162 --> 03:32:09.208
This ruined castle was used...

1728
03:32:09.291 --> 03:32:13.295
For housing and delousing
the Poles, and so on.


1729
03:32:13.378 --> 03:32:15.506
- The Jews!
- Yes, the Jews.


1730
03:32:16.590 --> 03:32:21.470
Why do you call them “Poles”
and not “Jews”?


1731
03:32:21.553 --> 03:32:24.181
Sometimes, I get them mixed up.

1732
03:32:25.015 --> 03:32:27.518
There's a difference
between Poles and Jews?


1733
03:32:27.601 --> 03:32:29.937
Oh, yes!

1734
03:32:30.020 --> 03:32:32.189
What difference?

1735
03:32:36.026 --> 03:32:39.238
The Poles weren't exterminated,

1736
03:32:39.696 --> 03:32:41.782
and the Jews were.

1737
03:32:41.865 --> 03:32:45.702
That's the difference.
An external difference, right?


1738
03:32:46.370 --> 03:32:48.288
And the inner difference?

1739
03:32:48.372 --> 03:32:50.624
I can't assess that.

1740
03:32:50.707 --> 03:32:56.672
I don't know enough
about psychology and anthropology.


1741
03:32:57.840 --> 03:33:00.926
The difference between
the Poles and the Jews?


1742
03:33:01.009 --> 03:33:03.887
Anyway, they couldn't stand each other.

1743
03:33:06.431 --> 03:33:08.767
On January 19, 1942,

1744
03:33:08.851 --> 03:33:11.979
the rabbi of Grabow, 
Jacob Schulmann,

1745
03:33:12.062 --> 03:33:15.899
wrote the following letter
to his friends in Lodz:


1746
03:33:17.025 --> 03:33:18.485
“My very dear friends,

1747
03:33:18.569 --> 03:33:23.490
I didn't write sooner:
I wasn't sure of what I'd heard.


1748
03:33:23.740 --> 03:33:27.786
Alas, to our great grief,
we now know all.


1749
03:33:28.412 --> 03:33:32.583
I've spoken to an eyewitness
who managed to escape.


1750
03:33:32.916 --> 03:33:34.751
He told me everything.

1751
03:33:34.835 --> 03:33:39.047
They're exterminated
in Chelmno, near Dombie,


1752
03:33:39.256 --> 03:33:42.259
and they're all buried
in the nearby Rzeszow forest.


1753
03:33:42.801 --> 03:33:47.598
The Jews are killed in <i>2</i> ways:
by shooting or gas.


1754
03:33:47.931 --> 03:33:52.644
It's just happened
to thousands of Lodz Jews.


1755
03:33:53.979 --> 03:33:58.150
Do not think that
this is being written by a madman.


1756
03:33:58.233 --> 03:34:02.029
Alas, it is the tragic, horrible truth.

1757
03:34:02.988 --> 03:34:07.534
Horror, horror.
Man, shed thy clothes,


1758
03:34:07.618 --> 03:34:10.621
cover thy head with ashes,
run in the streets


1759
03:34:10.913 --> 03:34:13.040
and dance in thy madness.

1760
03:34:14.583 --> 03:34:18.003
I am so weary that my pen
can no longer write.


1761
03:34:18.462 --> 03:34:21.965
Creator of the universe, help us!”

1762
03:34:23.008 --> 03:34:27.054
The creator did not help
the Jews of Grabow.


1763
03:34:27.429 --> 03:34:32.059
With their rabbi,
they all died in the gas van at Chelmno


1764
03:34:32.142 --> 03:34:34.061
a few weeks later.

1765
03:34:34.144 --> 03:34:38.190
Chelmno is only 12 miles from Grabow.

1766
03:35:25.529 --> 03:35:27.948
<i>Were there a lot
of Jews here in Grabow?</i>

1767
03:35:30.867 --> 03:35:33.036
<i>A lot, quite a few.</i>

1768
03:35:37.207 --> 03:35:38.792
<i>They were sent to Chelmno.</i>

1769
03:35:38.875 --> 03:35:41.920
Has she always lived near the synagogue?

1770
03:35:53.056 --> 03:35:55.892
- Yes.
- The Polish word is “Buzinica,” not synagogue.


1771
03:36:06.445 --> 03:36:09.364
She says it's now
a furniture warehouse


1772
03:36:09.448 --> 03:36:13.910
but they didn't harm it
from a religious point of view.


1773
03:36:13.994 --> 03:36:17.497
It hasn't been... desecrated.

1774
03:36:18.749 --> 03:36:21.251
Does she remember the rabbi
at the synagogue?


1775
03:36:23.962 --> 03:36:28.675
THE SYNAGOGUE IN GRABOW

1776
03:36:30.427 --> 03:36:35.057
<i>She says she's 80 now,
and her memory isn't too good,</i>


1777
03:36:35.140 --> 03:36:37.976
<i>and the Jews have been gone
for 40 years.</i>


1778
03:36:56.828 --> 03:37:00.165
Barbara, tell this couple
they live in a lovely house.


1779
03:37:03.794 --> 03:37:06.797
Do they agree?
Do they think it's a lovely house?


1780
03:37:17.140 --> 03:37:21.395
Tell me about the decoration
of this house, the doors,


1781
03:37:21.478 --> 03:37:23.230
what's it mean?

1782
03:37:30.112 --> 03:37:32.906
People used to do carvings like that.

1783
03:37:33.156 --> 03:37:35.200
Did they decorate it that way?

1784
03:37:38.120 --> 03:37:41.164
- No, it was the Jews again.
- The Jews did it!


1785
03:37:42.290 --> 03:37:44.626
The door's a good century old.

1786
03:37:45.335 --> 03:37:47.212
Did Jews own this house?

1787
03:37:50.507 --> 03:37:52.426
Yes, all these houses.

1788
03:37:52.509 --> 03:37:55.762
All these houses
on the square were Jewish?


1789
03:37:59.683 --> 03:38:05.105
Jews lived in all the ones in front,
on the street.


1790
03:38:06.189 --> 03:38:08.066
Where did the Poles live?

1791
03:38:11.278 --> 03:38:14.030
In the courtyards,
where the privies were.


1792
03:38:17.742 --> 03:38:20.787
There used to be a store here.

1793
03:38:20.871 --> 03:38:22.122
What kind?

1794
03:38:23.540 --> 03:38:25.459
A food store.

1795
03:38:25.542 --> 03:38:27.461
Owned by Jews?

1796
03:38:27.544 --> 03:38:28.587
Yes.

1797
03:38:29.087 --> 03:38:32.132
So the Jews lived in the front,

1798
03:38:32.215 --> 03:38:35.719
and the Poles in the courtyard
with the privies.


1799
03:38:45.228 --> 03:38:47.731
How long have these two lived here?

1800
03:38:54.779 --> 03:38:57.073
15 years.

1801
03:38:57.407 --> 03:38:59.326
Where'd they live before?

1802
03:39:02.120 --> 03:39:04.164
In a courtyard across the square.

1803
03:39:04.247 --> 03:39:06.124
They've gotten rich.

1804
03:39:06.208 --> 03:39:07.834
- Them?
- Yes.


1805
03:39:09.544 --> 03:39:10.670
Yes.

1806
03:39:11.254 --> 03:39:13.590
How did they get rich?

1807
03:39:17.260 --> 03:39:18.845
They worked.

1808
03:39:19.095 --> 03:39:21.014
How old is the gentleman?

1809
03:39:23.099 --> 03:39:24.476
He's 70.

1810
03:39:24.559 --> 03:39:26.645
He looks young and healthy.

1811
03:39:31.608 --> 03:39:34.361
Do they remember the Jews of Grabow?

1812
03:39:36.780 --> 03:39:37.989
Yes.

1813
03:39:38.073 --> 03:39:40.158
And when they were deported, too.

1814
03:39:40.242 --> 03:39:43.161
They recall the deportation
of the Grabow Jews?


1815
03:39:44.829 --> 03:39:46.706
He says he speaks “Jew” well.

1816
03:39:46.790 --> 03:39:48.542
He speaks “Jew”?

1817
03:39:50.961 --> 03:39:53.964
As a kid he played with Jews
so he speaks “Jew.”


1818
03:40:08.353 --> 03:40:12.232
First, they grouped them there,
where that restaurant is,


1819
03:40:12.315 --> 03:40:13.733
or in this square,

1820
03:40:13.817 --> 03:40:15.318
and took their gold.

1821
03:40:31.334 --> 03:40:35.046
An elder among the Jews
collected the gold


1822
03:40:35.130 --> 03:40:37.924
and turned it over to the police.

1823
03:40:38.258 --> 03:40:43.013
That done, the Jews were put
in the Catholic church.


1824
03:40:43.096 --> 03:40:44.764
A lot of gold?

1825
03:40:48.184 --> 03:40:50.729
Yes, the Jews had gold

1826
03:40:54.316 --> 03:40:57.110
and some handsome candelabras.

1827
03:41:07.787 --> 03:41:11.958
Did the Poles know the Jews
would be killed at Chelmno?


1828
03:41:19.257 --> 03:41:20.884
Yes, they knew.

1829
03:41:22.552 --> 03:41:24.387
The Jews knew it, too.

1830
03:41:26.097 --> 03:41:29.100
Did the Jews try to do
something about it,


1831
03:41:29.184 --> 03:41:31.645
to rebel, to escape?

1832
03:41:47.744 --> 03:41:49.746
The young tried to run away.

1833
03:41:52.916 --> 03:41:55.335
<i>But the Germans caught them</i>

1834
03:41:55.418 --> 03:41:59.297
<i>and maybe killed them
even more savagely.</i>


1835
03:42:08.598 --> 03:42:13.353
<i>In e very to wn and village,

1836
03:42:13.436 --> 03:42:15.105
<i>and the Jews were kept under guard.</i>

1837
03:42:15.188 --> 03:42:17.107
<i>They couldn't leave there.</i>

1838
03:42:23.571 --> 03:42:27.367
<i>Then they were locked
in the Polish church here in Grebe w</i>


1839
03:42:27.450 --> 03:42:29.953
<i>and later taken to Chelmno.</i>

1840
03:42:31.830 --> 03:42:35.500
BACKGROUND, THE SYNAGOGUE

1841
03:43:00.984 --> 03:43:04.696
The Germans threw children
as small as these


1842
03:43:05.029 --> 03:43:07.490
into the trucks by the legs.

1843
03:43:07.699 --> 03:43:09.492
She saw that?

1844
03:43:10.326 --> 03:43:13.079
- Old folks too.
- Threw kids into the trucks.


1845
03:43:13.997 --> 03:43:17.167
The Poles knew the Jews
would be gassed in Chelmno?


1846
03:43:17.751 --> 03:43:19.419
Did this gentleman know?

1847
03:43:29.137 --> 03:43:32.724
<i>Does he recall
the Jews' deportation from Grabow?</i>


1848
03:43:39.189 --> 03:43:41.775
<i>At that time, he worked in the mill.</i>

1849
03:43:41.858 --> 03:43:45.487
<i>- There, opposite?
- Yes, and they saw it all.</i>


1850
03:43:46.196 --> 03:43:49.699
What did he think of it?
Was it a sad sight?


1851
03:43:58.166 --> 03:43:59.667
Yes, it was...

1852
03:44:03.630 --> 03:44:07.967
Yes. How could you see that
without sadness?


1853
03:44:15.391 --> 03:44:17.435
What trades were the Jews in?

1854
03:44:25.235 --> 03:44:27.612
They were tanners, tradesmen,

1855
03:44:30.532 --> 03:44:31.908
tailors.

1856
03:44:39.123 --> 03:44:45.088
They sold things...
eggs, chickens, butter.


1857
03:44:48.424 --> 03:44:50.593
<i>There were a lot of tailors,</i>

1858
03:44:53.471 --> 03:44:55.306
<i>tradesmen, too.</i>

1859
03:44:56.391 --> 03:44:59.102
But most were tanners.

1860
03:45:02.814 --> 03:45:07.902
- They had beards and side locks.
- Yes.


1861
03:45:07.986 --> 03:45:10.238
He says they weren't pretty.

1862
03:45:10.321 --> 03:45:12.282
They weren't pretty?

1863
03:45:14.033 --> 03:45:16.619
- They stank, too.
- They stank?


1864
03:45:17.620 --> 03:45:19.163
Why did they stink?

1865
03:45:21.583 --> 03:45:25.461
Because they were tanners,
and the hides stink.


1866
03:45:29.507 --> 03:45:31.551
The Jewish women were beautiful.

1867
03:45:34.095 --> 03:45:36.639
The Poles liked to make love with them.

1868
03:45:36.931 --> 03:45:40.310
Are Polish women glad
there are no Jewesses left?


1869
03:45:48.818 --> 03:45:49.819
What'd she say?

1870
03:45:49.903 --> 03:45:54.532
That the women
who are her age now


1871
03:45:55.617 --> 03:45:57.785
also liked to make love.

1872
03:45:57.869 --> 03:46:00.872
So the Jewish women were competitors?

1873
03:46:04.500 --> 03:46:08.087
It's crazy how the Poles
liked the little Jewesses!


1874
03:46:08.171 --> 03:46:10.340
Do the Poles miss the little Jewesses?

1875
03:46:14.886 --> 03:46:17.847
Naturally, such beautiful women!

1876
03:46:18.056 --> 03:46:20.433
Why? What made them so beautiful?

1877
03:46:30.818 --> 03:46:33.988
Because they did nothing.
Polish women worked.


1878
03:46:34.072 --> 03:46:38.409
Jewish women only thought
of their beauty and clothes.


1879
03:46:38.701 --> 03:46:40.870
So Jewesses did no work!

1880
03:46:42.246 --> 03:46:44.582
- None at all.
- Why not?


1881
03:46:46.876 --> 03:46:48.461
They were rich.

1882
03:46:51.839 --> 03:46:55.301
The Poles had to serve them and work.

1883
03:46:55.385 --> 03:46:57.595
I heard her use the word “capital.”

1884
03:46:58.763 --> 03:47:01.391
The capital was
in the hands of the Jews.


1885
03:47:01.474 --> 03:47:03.643
Yes... You didn't translate that.

1886
03:47:04.560 --> 03:47:08.898
Ask her again. So the capital
was in the Jews' hands?


1887
03:47:11.943 --> 03:47:13.903
All Poland was in the Jews' hands.

1888
03:47:13.987 --> 03:47:17.407
Are they glad there are
no more Jews here, or sad?


1889
03:47:40.263 --> 03:47:41.764
It doesn't bother them.

1890
03:47:41.848 --> 03:47:46.769
As you know, Jews and Germans
ran all Polish industry before the war.


1891
03:47:46.853 --> 03:47:49.605
Did they like them on the whole?

1892
03:47:57.447 --> 03:48:04.203
<i>Not much.
Above all, they were dishonest.</i>


1893
03:48:06.456 --> 03:48:10.793
<i>Was life in Grabow more fun
when the Jews were here?</i>


1894
03:48:24.891 --> 03:48:27.060
He'd rather not say.

1895
03:48:27.769 --> 03:48:29.979
Why does he call them dishonest?

1896
03:48:40.782 --> 03:48:44.410
They exploited the Poles.
That's what they lived off.


1897
03:48:44.494 --> 03:48:46.496
How did they exploit them?

1898
03:49:01.344 --> 03:49:03.221
By imposing their prices.

1899
03:49:08.142 --> 03:49:10.228
Ask her if she likes her house.

1900
03:49:11.854 --> 03:49:12.855
Yes,

1901
03:49:14.023 --> 03:49:17.068
but her children live
in much better houses.


1902
03:49:17.860 --> 03:49:19.862
In modern houses!

1903
03:49:22.990 --> 03:49:25.451
They've all gone to college.

1904
03:49:25.535 --> 03:49:29.038
Great! That's progress!

1905
03:49:33.376 --> 03:49:38.339
Her children are
the best educated in the village.


1906
03:49:38.422 --> 03:49:41.717
Very good, Madam!
Long live education!


1907
03:49:44.804 --> 03:49:48.558
Isn't this a very old house?

1908
03:49:51.060 --> 03:49:53.020
Yes, Jews lived here before.

1909
03:49:53.104 --> 03:49:56.607
So Jews used to live here.
Did she know them?


1910
03:49:59.402 --> 03:50:00.653
Yes.

1911
03:50:00.736 --> 03:50:02.572
What was their name?

1912
03:50:08.578 --> 03:50:09.579
She doesn't know.

1913
03:50:09.662 --> 03:50:11.998
What was their trade?

1914
03:50:13.207 --> 03:50:16.169
Benkel, their name was.

1915
03:50:17.587 --> 03:50:19.755
And what was their trade?

1916
03:50:27.889 --> 03:50:29.932
They had a butcher shop.

1917
03:50:30.725 --> 03:50:33.144
A butcher shop.
Why is she laughing?


1918
03:50:35.938 --> 03:50:39.400
Because the gentleman said it was...

1919
03:50:40.776 --> 03:50:44.614
a butcher shop where
you could buy cheap meat. Beef!


1920
03:50:46.073 --> 03:50:49.285
What does he think about
them being gassed in trucks?


1921
03:50:58.419 --> 03:51:00.963
He says he doesn't like that at all.

1922
03:51:10.514 --> 03:51:14.602
If they'd gone to Israel
of their own free will,


1923
03:51:14.685 --> 03:51:16.229
he might have been glad.

1924
03:51:16.312 --> 03:51:20.107
But killing them was unpleasant.

1925
03:51:23.319 --> 03:51:25.404
Does he miss the Jews?

1926
03:51:37.291 --> 03:51:40.628
Yes, because there were
some beautiful Jewesses.


1927
03:51:40.711 --> 03:51:42.755
For the young, it was... fine.

1928
03:51:42.838 --> 03:51:47.885
Are they sorry the Jews
are no longer here or pleased?


1929
03:51:56.435 --> 03:52:01.232
How can I tell?
I never went to school.


1930
03:52:01.524 --> 03:52:05.736
I can only think of how I am now.
Now I'm fine.


1931
03:52:06.570 --> 03:52:08.531
Is she better off?

1932
03:52:15.246 --> 03:52:17.832
Before the war, she picked potatoes.

1933
03:52:17.915 --> 03:52:21.669
Now she sells eggs,
and she's much better off.


1934
03:52:21.752 --> 03:52:25.423
Because the Jews are gone
or because of socialism?


1935
03:52:31.220 --> 03:52:35.975
She doesn't care, she's happy
because she's doing well now.


1936
03:52:36.058 --> 03:52:40.062
How did he feel about
losing his classmates?


1937
03:52:48.237 --> 03:52:50.156
It still upsets him.

1938
03:52:51.073 --> 03:52:52.908
Does he miss the Jews?

1939
03:52:54.243 --> 03:52:55.202
Certainly.

1940
03:52:55.286 --> 03:52:57.705
They were good Jews, Madam says.

1941
03:53:00.041 --> 03:53:03.586
GRABOW IN WINTER

1942
03:53:49.423 --> 03:53:52.635
<i>The Jews came in trucks,</i>

1943
03:53:54.762 --> 03:53:58.682
<i>and later there was
a narrow-gauge railway</i>


1944
03:53:58.766 --> 03:54:01.310
<i>that they arrived on.</i>

1945
03:54:02.478 --> 03:54:07.191
<i>They were packed tightly in the trucks,</i>

1946
03:54:07.274 --> 03:54:10.986
<i>or in the cars
of the narrow-gauge railway.</i>


1947
03:54:12.321 --> 03:54:14.615
Lots of women and children.

1948
03:54:14.949 --> 03:54:18.452
Men too, but most of them were old.

1949
03:54:18.661 --> 03:54:23.374
The strongest were put in work details.

1950
03:54:23.833 --> 03:54:28.045
They walked with chains on their legs.

1951
03:54:28.129 --> 03:54:31.215
In the morning, they fetched water,

1952
03:54:31.298 --> 03:54:34.593
looked for food, and so on.

1953
03:54:36.137 --> 03:54:39.265
These weren't killed right away.

1954
03:54:39.348 --> 03:54:41.434
That was done later.

1955
03:54:41.517 --> 03:54:44.520
I don't know what became of them.

1956
03:54:44.728 --> 03:54:47.314
They didn't survive, anyway.

1957
03:54:47.398 --> 03:54:49.692
Two of them did.

1958
03:54:49.775 --> 03:54:51.444
Only two.

1959
03:54:51.777 --> 03:54:53.779
They were in chains?

1960
03:54:54.822 --> 03:54:56.824
- On the legs.
- All of them?


1961
03:54:56.907 --> 03:55:04.123
The workers, yes.
The others were killed at once.


1962
03:55:04.206 --> 03:55:09.462
The Jewish work squad
went through the village in chains.


1963
03:55:09.795 --> 03:55:11.422
Yes.

1964
03:55:13.007 --> 03:55:15.676
Could people speak to them?

1965
03:55:15.759 --> 03:55:20.139
No, that was impossible.

1966
03:55:20.222 --> 03:55:21.599
Why?

1967
03:55:22.641 --> 03:55:24.685
No one dared.

1968
03:55:25.394 --> 03:55:28.022
- What?
- No one dared.


1969
03:55:28.564 --> 03:55:30.274
Understand?

1970
03:55:30.900 --> 03:55:32.985
Yes... No one dared.

1971
03:55:33.068 --> 03:55:35.070
Why, was it dangerous?

1972
03:55:35.154 --> 03:55:42.244
Yes, there were guards.

1973
03:55:45.289 --> 03:55:48.959
Anyway, people wanted
nothing to do with all that.


1974
03:55:49.960 --> 03:55:51.420
Do you see?

1975
03:55:51.504 --> 03:55:55.758
Gets on your nerves,
seeing that every day.


1976
03:56:03.349 --> 03:56:08.145
<i>You can't force a whole village
to watch such distress.</i>


1977
03:56:09.647 --> 03:56:11.982
<i>When the Jews arrived,</i>

1978
03:56:12.066 --> 03:56:16.028
<i>when they were pushed
into the church or the castle...</i>


1979
03:56:16.779 --> 03:56:18.614
<i>And the screams!</i>

1980
03:56:18.697 --> 03:56:22.326
<i>It was frightful!
Depressing.</i>


1981
03:56:22.576 --> 03:56:26.622
<i>Day after day, the same spectacle!</i>

1982
03:56:30.584 --> 03:56:34.797
<i>It was terrible!
A sad spectacle!</i>


1983
03:56:35.673 --> 03:56:39.301
<i>They screamed.
They knew what was happening.</i>


1984
03:56:40.636 --> 03:56:44.723
<i>At first, the Jews thought
they were going to be deloused.</i>


1985
03:56:45.266 --> 03:56:48.936
<i>But they soon understood.</i>

1986
03:56:49.019 --> 03:56:51.814
<i>Their screams grew wilder and wilder.</i>

1987
03:56:53.649 --> 03:56:56.694
<i>Horrifying screams. 
Screams of terror.</i>

1988
03:56:56.777 --> 03:57:00.573
<i>Because they knew
what was happening to them.</i>


1989
03:57:03.325 --> 03:57:07.496
<i>Do you know how many Jews
were exterminated there?</i>


1990
03:57:09.331 --> 03:57:13.210
<i>Four something,

1991
03:57:13.294 --> 03:57:14.878
400, 000.

1992
03:57:16.130 --> 03:57:20.009
<i>400,000, yes.
I knew it had a 4 in it.</i>


1993
03:57:21.385 --> 03:57:23.929
<i>Sad, sad, sad!</i>

1994
03:57:26.140 --> 03:57:29.226
<i>When the soldiers march,</i>

1995
03:57:29.310 --> 03:57:32.855
<i>the girls open
their windows and doors...</i>


1996
03:57:41.196 --> 03:57:47.077
<i>Do you remember
a Jewish child, a boy of 13?</i>


1997
03:57:47.328 --> 03:57:50.205
<i>He was in the work squad.</i>

1998
03:57:50.581 --> 03:57:53.709
<i>He sang on the river.</i>

1999
03:57:53.792 --> 03:57:55.878
- <i>On the Narew River?</i>
- <i>Yes.</i>


2000
03:57:56.712 --> 03:57:59.048
- <i>Is he still alive ?</i>
- <i>Yes, he is alive.</i>


2001
03:57:59.632 --> 03:58:04.094
<i>He sang a German song</i>

2002
03:58:04.553 --> 03:58:09.975
<i>that the SS in Chelmno taught him.</i>

2003
03:58:10.059 --> 03:58:13.103
<i>“When the soldiers march,</i>

2004
03:58:13.187 --> 03:58:15.648
<i>the girls open
their windows and doors...”</i>


2005
03:58:30.245 --> 03:58:32.498
SIMON SREBNIK,

2006
03:58:32.790 --> 03:58:36.752
the survivor of the 2nd period
of extermination at Chelmno


2007
03:58:37.086 --> 03:58:39.588
(the church period)

2008
03:59:50.075 --> 03:59:52.369
So it's a holiday in Chelmno!

2009
03:59:55.706 --> 03:59:58.041
What holiday?
What's being celebrated?


2010
04:00:03.088 --> 04:00:06.884
The birth of the Virgin Mary.
It's her birthday.


2011
04:00:09.136 --> 04:00:11.513
It's a huge crowd, isn't it?

2012
04:00:17.853 --> 04:00:21.356
But the weather's bad...
it's raining.


2013
04:00:22.024 --> 04:00:25.235
Ask them if they're glad
to see Srebnik again.


2014
04:00:29.990 --> 04:00:31.617
Very. it's a great pleasure.

2015
04:00:31.700 --> 04:00:33.160
Why?

2016
04:00:37.414 --> 04:00:40.626
They're glad to see him again,

2017
04:00:43.253 --> 04:00:46.298
because they know
all he's lived through.


2018
04:00:46.381 --> 04:00:50.260
Seeing him as he is now,
they're very pleased.


2019
04:00:50.344 --> 04:00:52.054
They're pleased?

2020
04:00:52.846 --> 04:00:55.557
Why does the whole village
remember him?


2021
04:01:11.073 --> 04:01:13.534
They remember him well

2022
04:01:14.743 --> 04:01:18.831
because he walked
with chains on his ankles,


2023
04:01:18.914 --> 04:01:22.709
and he sang on the river.

2024
04:01:22.918 --> 04:01:24.628
He was young,

2025
04:01:25.254 --> 04:01:27.130
he was skinny,

2026
04:01:27.673 --> 04:01:31.260
he looked ready for his coffin.

2027
04:01:31.343 --> 04:01:34.304
Ripe for a coffin!

2028
04:01:34.388 --> 04:01:36.682
Did he seem happy or sad?

2029
04:01:45.774 --> 04:01:47.818
Even the lady,

2030
04:01:57.411 --> 04:02:00.956
when she saw that child,

2031
04:02:01.039 --> 04:02:04.543
she told the German,
“Let that child go!”


2032
04:02:04.626 --> 04:02:06.712
He asked her, “Where to?”

2033
04:02:06.795 --> 04:02:08.422
“To his father and mother.”

2034
04:02:08.505 --> 04:02:12.301
Looking at the sky, he said,
“He'll soon go to them.”


2035
04:02:12.384 --> 04:02:14.303
The German said that?

2036
04:02:15.304 --> 04:02:19.141
They remember when the Jews
were locked in this church?


2037
04:02:23.896 --> 04:02:25.689
Yes, they do.

2038
04:02:30.193 --> 04:02:32.446
They brought them
to the church in trucks.


2039
04:02:32.529 --> 04:02:34.698
At what time of day?

2040
04:02:40.370 --> 04:02:42.164
All day long and into the night.

2041
04:02:42.414 --> 04:02:46.710
What happened?
Can they describe it in detail?


2042
04:03:05.854 --> 04:03:08.774
At first, the Jews
were taken to the castle.


2043
04:03:08.857 --> 04:03:12.277
Only later were they put
into the church.


2044
04:03:12.361 --> 04:03:14.529
The second phase, right!

2045
04:03:15.405 --> 04:03:18.450
In the morning,
they were taken into the woods.


2046
04:03:18.533 --> 04:03:22.371
How were they taken into the woods?

2047
04:03:28.961 --> 04:03:31.713
In very big armored vans.

2048
04:03:41.682 --> 04:03:44.434
The gas came through the bottom.

2049
04:03:47.521 --> 04:03:50.816
Then they were carried
in gas vans, right?


2050
04:03:54.403 --> 04:03:56.321
Yes, in gas vans.

2051
04:03:57.531 --> 04:03:59.950
Where did the vans pick them up?

2052
04:04:00.951 --> 04:04:02.703
- The Jews?
- Yes.


2053
04:04:06.081 --> 04:04:08.000
Here, at the church door.

2054
04:04:08.083 --> 04:04:10.752
The trucks pulled up where they are now?

2055
04:04:12.129 --> 04:04:14.172
No, they went right to the door.

2056
04:04:14.256 --> 04:04:17.592
The vans came to the church door?

2057
04:04:19.886 --> 04:04:24.307
And they all knew these were death vans?

2058
04:04:30.939 --> 04:04:33.191
Yes, they couldn't help knowing.

2059
04:04:35.152 --> 04:04:37.738
They heard screams at night?

2060
04:04:42.784 --> 04:04:44.995
The Jews moaned, they were hungry.

2061
04:04:47.873 --> 04:04:49.958
They were shut in and starved.

2062
04:04:50.167 --> 04:04:52.127
Did they have any food?

2063
04:04:58.717 --> 04:05:03.138
You couldn't look there.
You couldn't talk to a Jew.


2064
04:05:10.145 --> 04:05:14.524
Even going by on the road,
you couldn't look there.


2065
04:05:14.608 --> 04:05:16.651
Did they look anyway?

2066
04:05:22.491 --> 04:05:25.494
Yes, vans came,

2067
04:05:25.702 --> 04:05:28.747
and the Jews were moved farther off.

2068
04:05:28.830 --> 04:05:30.832
You could see them, but on the sly.

2069
04:05:30.916 --> 04:05:33.293
- In sidelong glances.
- That's right.


2070
04:05:37.339 --> 04:05:40.217
That's right, in sidelong glances.

2071
04:05:41.051 --> 04:05:44.513
What kind of cries and moans
were heard at night?


2072
04:06:01.738 --> 04:06:05.450
They called on Jesus and Mary and God,

2073
04:06:05.534 --> 04:06:08.203
sometimes in German, as she puts it.

2074
04:06:10.580 --> 04:06:13.667
The Jews called on Jesus, Mary and God!

2075
04:06:17.838 --> 04:06:22.467
The presbytery was full of suitcases.

2076
04:06:22.551 --> 04:06:24.553
The Jews' suitcases?

2077
04:06:26.221 --> 04:06:29.266
Yes, and there was gold.

2078
04:06:32.435 --> 04:06:35.647
How does she know there was gold?

2079
04:06:42.654 --> 04:06:45.866
The procession! <i>We'll</i> stop now.

2080
04:09:25.150 --> 04:09:27.277
Were there as many Jews
in the church


2081
04:09:27.360 --> 04:09:29.821
as there were Christians today?

2082
04:09:38.038 --> 04:09:39.331
Almost.

2083
04:09:39.414 --> 04:09:43.126
How many gas vans
were needed to empty it out?


2084
04:09:53.762 --> 04:09:55.263
An average of 50.

2085
04:09:55.347 --> 04:09:57.891
It took 50 vans to empty it!

2086
04:09:58.767 --> 04:10:00.894
In a steady stream?

2087
04:10:04.606 --> 04:10:05.398
Yes.

2088
04:10:05.482 --> 04:10:07.400
The lady said before

2089
04:10:07.484 --> 04:10:11.613
that the Jews' suitcases
were dumped in the house opposite.


2090
04:10:15.033 --> 04:10:17.577
What was in this baggage?

2091
04:10:22.082 --> 04:10:25.543
Pots with false bottoms.

2092
04:10:25.794 --> 04:10:30.256
What was in the false bottoms?

2093
04:10:35.136 --> 04:10:37.764
Valuables... objects of value.

2094
04:10:40.100 --> 04:10:43.937
They also had gold in their clothes.

2095
04:10:48.066 --> 04:10:52.529
When given food, the Jews
sometimes threw them valuables


2096
04:10:52.612 --> 04:10:54.406
or sometimes money.

2097
04:10:55.073 --> 04:10:59.369
They said before
it was forbidden to talk to Jews.


2098
04:11:05.834 --> 04:11:08.044
Absolutely forbidden.

2099
04:11:11.256 --> 04:11:13.716
Ask them if they miss the Jews.

2100
04:11:20.515 --> 04:11:22.225
Of course.

2101
04:11:25.019 --> 04:11:28.857
We wept too, Madam says.

2102
04:11:32.193 --> 04:11:36.197
And Mr. Kantarowski
gave them bread and cucumbers.


2103
04:11:45.373 --> 04:11:49.377
Why do they think
all this happened to the Jews?


2104
04:11:56.801 --> 04:11:59.220
Because they were the richest!

2105
04:12:00.930 --> 04:12:05.810
Many Poles were also exterminated.

2106
04:12:05.894 --> 04:12:07.395
Even priests.

2107
04:12:07.479 --> 04:12:09.355
Mr. Kantarowski...

2108
04:12:15.028 --> 04:12:17.739
will tell us what a friend told him.

2109
04:12:17.822 --> 04:12:20.742
It happened in Myndjewyce, near Warsaw.

2110
04:12:20.825 --> 04:12:22.285
Go on.

2111
04:12:40.428 --> 04:12:44.641
The Jews were gathered in a square.

2112
04:12:44.891 --> 04:12:48.937
The rabbi asked an SS man,
“Can I talk to them?”


2113
04:12:49.395 --> 04:12:51.439
The guard said yes.

2114
04:13:04.953 --> 04:13:09.707
So the rabbi said
that around 2,000 years ago,


2115
04:13:09.791 --> 04:13:14.295
the Jews condemned
the innocent Christ to death.


2116
04:13:25.473 --> 04:13:28.893
And when they did that,
they cried out,


2117
04:13:28.977 --> 04:13:33.273
“Let his blood fall on our heads
and on our sons' heads.”


2118
04:13:47.453 --> 04:13:51.165
Then the rabbi told them,

2119
04:13:51.249 --> 04:13:56.671
“Perhaps the time has come for that,
so let us do nothing.


2120
04:13:57.130 --> 04:14:00.842
Let us go,
let us do as we're asked.”


2121
04:14:00.925 --> 04:14:03.970
He thinks the Jews expiated
the death of Christ?


2122
04:14:10.351 --> 04:14:13.938
He doesn't think so,
or even that Christ sought revenge.


2123
04:14:14.022 --> 04:14:17.525
He didn't say that.
The rabbi said it.


2124
04:14:20.653 --> 04:14:23.531
It was God's will, that's all!

2125
04:14:39.088 --> 04:14:41.466
- What'd she say?
- So Pilate washed his hands


2126
04:14:41.549 --> 04:14:46.638
and said, “Christ is innocent,”
he sent Barabbas.


2127
04:14:46.721 --> 04:14:48.806
But the Jews cried out,

2128
04:14:48.890 --> 04:14:51.893
“Let his blood fall on our heads.”

2129
04:14:54.854 --> 04:14:56.981
That's all. Now you know!

2130
04:16:21.065 --> 04:16:24.569
<i>Was the road between Chelmno,
the village</i>


2131
04:16:24.652 --> 04:16:26.738
<i>and the woods where the pits were,</i>

2132
04:16:26.821 --> 04:16:29.323
<i>was it asphalted as it is now?</i>

2133
04:16:45.423 --> 04:16:50.178
<i>The road was narrower then,
but it was asphalted.</i>


2134
04:16:59.771 --> 04:17:03.524
<i>How many feet
were the pits from the road?</i>


2135
04:17:28.216 --> 04:17:32.386
<i>They were around 1,600 feet,</i>

2136
04:17:32.470 --> 04:17:35.765
<i>maybe 1,900 or 2,200 feet away.</i>

2137
04:17:36.891 --> 04:17:41.395
<i>So even from the road,
you couldn't see them.</i>


2138
04:17:55.243 --> 04:17:57.745
How fast did the vans go?

2139
04:18:01.040 --> 04:18:04.252
PAN FALBORSKI

2140
04:18:04.585 --> 04:18:09.298
At moderate speed, kind of slow.

2141
04:18:27.108 --> 04:18:28.609
It was a calculated speed

2142
04:18:28.693 --> 04:18:34.073
because they had to kill
the people inside on the way.


2143
04:18:34.156 --> 04:18:35.950
When they went too fast,

2144
04:18:36.033 --> 04:18:40.454
the people weren't quite dead
on arrival in the woods.


2145
04:18:40.705 --> 04:18:47.128
By going slower, they had time
to kill the people inside.


2146
04:18:48.170 --> 04:18:52.425
Once a van skidded on a curve.

2147
04:19:05.146 --> 04:19:07.982
<i>Half an hour later, I arrived</i>

2148
04:19:08.065 --> 04:19:11.444
<i>at the hut of a forest warden
named Senajak.</i>


2149
04:19:22.622 --> 04:19:26.584
<i>He told me, “Too bad you were late.</i>

2150
04:19:26.667 --> 04:19:29.253
<i>You could have seen a van that skidded.</i>

2151
04:19:29.337 --> 04:19:32.632
<i>The rear of the van opened,</i>

2152
04:19:33.007 --> 04:19:35.843
<i>and the Jews fell out on the road.</i>

2153
04:19:38.930 --> 04:19:40.848
<i>They were still alive.</i>

2154
04:19:46.812 --> 04:19:52.360
<i>Seeing those Jews crawling,
a Gestapo man</i>


2155
04:19:52.443 --> 04:19:56.989
<i>took out his revolver and shot them.</i>

2156
04:20:09.126 --> 04:20:11.462
<i>He finished them all off.</i>

2157
04:20:13.130 --> 04:20:18.219
<i>Then they brought Jews
who were working in the woods.</i>


2158
04:20:22.181 --> 04:20:25.601
<i>They righted the van</i>

2159
04:20:26.310 --> 04:20:29.563
<i>and put the bodies back inside.”</i>

2160
04:20:39.073 --> 04:20:41.075
<i>This was the road</i>

2161
04:20:42.118 --> 04:20:47.081
<i>the gas vans used.</i>

2162
04:20:48.916 --> 04:20:52.545
<i>There were 80 people in each van.</i>

2163
04:20:57.758 --> 04:21:01.012
<i>When they arrived, the SS said,</i>

2164
04:21:01.095 --> 04:21:03.139
<i>“Open the doors!”</i>

2165
04:21:03.848 --> 04:21:09.145
<i>We opened them.
The bodies tumbled right out.</i>


2166
04:21:10.604 --> 04:21:13.149
<i>An SS man said, “2 men inside!”</i>

2167
04:21:13.524 --> 04:21:19.238
<i>These 2 men worked at the ovens.
They were experienced.</i>


2168
04:21:20.448 --> 04:21:22.867
<i>Another SS man screamed,</i>

2169
04:21:22.950 --> 04:21:28.122
<i>“Hurry up!
The other van's coming!”</i>


2170
04:21:28.998 --> 04:21:34.754
<i>We worked until
the whole shipment was burned.</i>


2171
04:21:39.508 --> 04:21:43.888
<i>That's how it went, all daylong.
So it went.</i>


2172
04:22:13.876 --> 04:22:18.339
<i>I remember
that once they were still alive.</i>


2173
04:22:21.425 --> 04:22:24.220
<i>The ovens were full,</i>

2174
04:22:26.388 --> 04:22:29.725
<i>and the people lay on the ground.</i>

2175
04:22:30.392 --> 04:22:33.354
<i>They were all moving,</i>

2176
04:22:33.437 --> 04:22:36.148
<i>they were coming back to life,</i>

2177
04:22:39.360 --> 04:22:42.738
<i>and when they were thrown
into the ovens,</i>


2178
04:22:42.822 --> 04:22:44.448
<i>they were all conscious. Alive.</i>

2179
04:22:44.532 --> 04:22:48.035
<i>They could feel the fire burn them.</i>

2180
04:23:09.640 --> 04:23:15.020
<i>When we built the ovens,
I wondered what they were for.</i>


2181
04:23:18.399 --> 04:23:20.776
<i>An SS man told me,</i>

2182
04:23:21.068 --> 04:23:25.948
<i>“To make charcoal.
For laundry irons.”</i>


2183
04:23:26.907 --> 04:23:29.410
<i>That's what he told me.
I didn't know.</i>


2184
04:23:32.580 --> 04:23:35.624
<i>When the ovens were completed,</i>

2185
04:23:37.751 --> 04:23:40.880
<i>the logs put in</i>

2186
04:23:40.963 --> 04:23:44.758
<i>and the gasoline poured on and lighted,</i>

2187
04:23:46.594 --> 04:23:49.597
<i>and when the first gas van arrived,</i>

2188
04:23:50.055 --> 04:23:55.102
<i>then we knew why the ovens were built.</i>

2189
04:24:04.862 --> 04:24:08.324
<i>When I saw all
that, it didn't affect me.</i>

2190
04:24:09.491 --> 04:24:14.205
<i>Neither did the 2nd or 3rd shipment.</i>

2191
04:24:17.124 --> 04:24:20.294
<i>I was only 13,</i>

2192
04:24:20.628 --> 04:24:24.548
<i>and all I'd ever seen until then</i>

2193
04:24:24.632 --> 04:24:28.135
<i>were dead bodies.</i>

2194
04:24:32.723 --> 04:24:34.892
Maybe I didn't understand.

2195
04:24:35.726 --> 04:24:41.315
Maybe if I'd been older
I'd have understood,


2196
04:24:41.398 --> 04:24:43.317
but the fact is, I didn't.

2197
04:24:43.525 --> 04:24:47.404
I'd never seen anything else.

2198
04:24:48.322 --> 04:24:53.077
In the ghetto, I saw...
in the ghetto in Lodz,


2199
04:24:53.160 --> 04:24:57.665
that as soon as anyone took a step,
he fell dead.


2200
04:24:57.998 --> 04:25:02.002
I thought that was
the way things had to be.


2201
04:25:02.378 --> 04:25:03.921
It was normal.

2202
04:25:04.004 --> 04:25:06.131
I'd walk the streets of Lodz,

2203
04:25:07.341 --> 04:25:11.845
maybe 100 yards,
and there'd be 200 bodies.


2204
04:25:14.848 --> 04:25:16.684
People were hungry.

2205
04:25:16.767 --> 04:25:20.229
They went into the street
and they fell, they fell...


2206
04:25:21.438 --> 04:25:24.358
Sons took their fathers' bread,

2207
04:25:24.441 --> 04:25:27.653
fathers took their sons'.

2208
04:25:27.736 --> 04:25:31.073
Everyone wanted to stay alive.

2209
04:25:33.200 --> 04:25:36.287
So when I came here, to Chelmno,

2210
04:25:36.787 --> 04:25:38.622
I was already...

2211
04:25:39.373 --> 04:25:42.376
I didn't care about anything.

2212
04:25:42.960 --> 04:25:48.424
I thought, if I survive,

2213
04:25:48.507 --> 04:25:50.718
I just want one thing:

2214
04:25:52.261 --> 04:25:54.596
5 loaves of bread to eat.

2215
04:25:54.680 --> 04:25:56.265
That's all.

2216
04:25:56.515 --> 04:25:59.059
That's what I thought.

2217
04:25:59.143 --> 04:26:00.936
But I dreamed, too,

2218
04:26:01.020 --> 04:26:04.440
that if I survived,
I'd be the only one left in the world,


2219
04:26:04.523 --> 04:26:07.192
not another soul. Just me. One.

2220
04:26:13.657 --> 04:26:17.745
<i>Only me left in the world,
if I get out of here.</i>


2221
04:26:34.511 --> 04:26:37.264
THE RUHR

2222
04:26:38.766 --> 04:26:43.979
<i>“Geheime Reichssache, ”
secret Reich business.</i>


2223
04:26:46.023 --> 04:26:49.610
<i>“Berlin, June 5, 1942.</i>

2224
04:26:52.613 --> 04:26:57.743
<i>Changes to be made
to special vehicles now in service</i>


2225
04:26:57.951 --> 04:27:00.287
<i>at Kulmhof (Chelmno)</i>

2226
04:27:00.662 --> 04:27:02.664
<i>and to those now being built.</i>

2227
04:27:08.170 --> 04:27:11.090
<i>Since December 1941,</i>

2228
04:27:11.965 --> 04:27:18.389
<i>97,000 have been processed
(verarbeitet in German)</i>


2229
04:27:19.306 --> 04:27:23.227
<i>by the 3 vehicles in service,
with no major incident.</i>


2230
04:27:25.521 --> 04:27:30.067
<i>In light of observations
made so far, however,</i>


2231
04:27:30.150 --> 04:27:33.445
<i>the following technical changes
are needed:</i>


2232
04:27:34.655 --> 04:27:35.989
<i>First,</i>

2233
04:27:36.865 --> 04:27:42.413
<i>the van's normal load
is usually 9 to 10 per square yard.</i>


2234
04:27:44.832 --> 04:27:48.836
<i>In Saurer vehicles,
which are very spacious,</i>


2235
04:27:50.003 --> 04:27:53.632
<i>maximum use of space is impossible,</i>

2236
04:27:54.341 --> 04:27:57.511
<i>not because of any possible overload,</i>

2237
04:27:58.846 --> 04:28:02.349
<i>but because loading to full capacity</i>

2238
04:28:02.433 --> 04:28:06.103
<i>would affect the vehicle's stability.</i>

2239
04:28:07.771 --> 04:28:11.984
<i>So reduction of the load space
seems necessary.</i>


2240
04:28:14.236 --> 04:28:17.656
<i>It must absolutely
be reduced by a yard,</i>


2241
04:28:17.739 --> 04:28:22.286
<i>instead of trying to solve the problem,
as hitherto,</i>


2242
04:28:22.369 --> 04:28:25.914
<i>by reducing the number
of pieces loaded.</i>


2243
04:28:29.126 --> 04:28:34.590
<i>Besides, this extends the operating time,</i>

2244
04:28:36.258 --> 04:28:40.637
<i>as the empty void must also
be filled with carbon monoxide.</i>


2245
04:28:42.389 --> 04:28:46.810
<i>On the other hand,
if the load space is reduced</i>


2246
04:28:47.436 --> 04:28:50.439
<i>and the vehicle is packed solid,</i>

2247
04:28:51.231 --> 04:28:55.486
<i>the operating time can be
considerably shortened.</i>


2248
04:28:56.945 --> 04:29:00.699
<i>The manufacturers told us
during a discussion,</i>


2249
04:29:01.283 --> 04:29:05.037
<i>that reducing the size
of the van's rear</i>


2250
04:29:05.621 --> 04:29:08.165
<i>would throw it badly off balance.</i>

2251
04:29:09.249 --> 04:29:13.128
<i>The front axle, they claim,
would be overloaded.</i>


2252
04:29:16.298 --> 04:29:21.970
<i>In fact, the balance
is automatically restored</i>


2253
04:29:23.180 --> 04:29:26.266
<i>because the merchandise aboard</i>

2254
04:29:27.434 --> 04:29:31.021
<i>displays, during the operation,</i>

2255
04:29:31.104 --> 04:29:35.442
<i>a natural tendency
to rush to the rear doors,</i>


2256
04:29:36.652 --> 04:29:41.698
<i>and are mainly found lying there
at the end of the operation.</i>


2257
04:29:44.284 --> 04:29:49.248
<i>So the front axle is not overloaded.</i>

2258
04:29:54.378 --> 04:29:55.963
<i>Secondly:</i>

2259
04:29:58.215 --> 04:30:03.887
<i>The lighting must be
better protected than now.</i>


2260
04:30:06.139 --> 04:30:09.434
<i>The lamps must be enclosed
in a steel grid</i>


2261
04:30:09.518 --> 04:30:12.437
<i>to prevent their being damaged.</i>

2262
04:30:14.523 --> 04:30:17.192
<i>Lights could be eliminated,</i>

2263
04:30:17.276 --> 04:30:20.821
<i>since they apparently are never used.</i>

2264
04:30:22.864 --> 04:30:27.119
<i>However, it has been observed</i>

2265
04:30:27.202 --> 04:30:29.746
<i>that when the doors are shut,</i>

2266
04:30:30.747 --> 04:30:36.753
<i>the load always
presses hard against them</i>


2267
04:30:36.837 --> 04:30:39.172
<i>(against the doors)</i>

2268
04:30:39.256 --> 04:30:41.967
<i>as soon as darkness sets in.</i>

2269
04:30:42.884 --> 04:30:46.179
<i>This is because the load</i>

2270
04:30:46.805 --> 04:30:49.850
<i>naturally rushes toward the light</i>

2271
04:30:51.393 --> 04:30:53.353
<i>when darkness sets in,</i>

2272
04:30:54.688 --> 04:30:57.816
<i>which makes
closing the doors difficult.</i>


2273
04:31:00.235 --> 04:31:05.907
<i>Also, because
of the alarming nature of darkness,</i>


2274
04:31:07.242 --> 04:31:13.081
<i>screaming always occurs
when the doors are closed.</i>


2275
04:31:15.375 --> 04:31:18.545
<i>It would therefore be useful
to light the lamp</i>


2276
04:31:19.546 --> 04:31:23.216
<i>before and during
the first moments of the operation.</i>


2277
04:31:26.303 --> 04:31:27.804
<i>Third:</i>

2278
04:31:30.057 --> 04:31:32.851
<i>For easy cleaning of the vehicle,</i>

2279
04:31:33.727 --> 04:31:38.774
<i>there must be a sealed drain
in the middle of the ﬂoor.</i>


2280
04:31:40.567 --> 04:31:45.947
<i>The drainage hole's cover,

2281
04:31:46.948 --> 04:31:49.534
<i>would be equipped with a slanting trap,</i>

2282
04:31:50.452 --> 04:31:53.538
<i>so that ﬂuid liquids</i>

2283
04:31:57.000 --> 04:32:00.253
<i>can drain off during the operation.</i>

2284
04:32:05.676 --> 04:32:07.552
<i>During cleaning,</i>

2285
04:32:07.761 --> 04:32:12.432
<i>the drain can be used
to evacuate large pieces of din'.</i>


2286
04:32:22.484 --> 04:32:25.612
<i>The aforementioned technical changes</i>

2287
04:32:25.696 --> 04:32:28.281
<i>are to be made
to vehicles in service</i>


2288
04:32:28.365 --> 04:32:32.035
<i>only when they come in for repairs.</i>

2289
04:32:34.621 --> 04:32:38.125
<i>As for the 10 vehicles
ordered from Saurer,</i>


2290
04:32:41.795 --> 04:32:47.718
<i>they must be equipped
with all innovations and changes</i>


2291
04:32:48.802 --> 04:32:52.097
<i>shown by use
and experience to be necessary.</i>


2292
04:32:54.975 --> 04:32:59.604
<i>Submitted for decision
to Gruppenleiter II D,</i>
