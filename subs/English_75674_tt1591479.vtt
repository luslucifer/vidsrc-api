Maybe eight to ten, bro, but we don't

00:19:52.505 --> 00:19:54.846
Senior, what kind of weapons-on-target
are we looking at?


304
00:19:54.971 --> 00:19:57.108
Heavy weapons.
These guys are narco-traffickers,


305
00:19:57.271 --> 00:19:59.374
so they can have anything
from Soviet-bloc DShKs.


306
00:19:59.538 --> 00:20:02.277
They could have M2HP,
.50-cals out there, we don't know.


307
00:20:02.438 --> 00:20:05.574
So if there is a weapons' emplacement up
there, I suggest you guys bring rockets.


308
00:20:05.738 --> 00:20:09.273
Of course, rockets and foliage don't match,
so make sure you got a clear shot.


309
00:20:09.438 --> 00:20:10.676
All right, what else?

310
00:20:10.804 --> 00:20:13.112
Any idea whether she's ambulatory or not?

311
00:20:13.271 --> 00:20:14.839
There was a ton
of blood on the scene,

312
00:20:15.004 --> 00:20:17.414
and a lot of it was Mr. Ross',
we confirmed that.


313
00:20:17.571 --> 00:20:20.606
Miss Morales may have bled there, too,
but these guys are savages,


314
00:20:20.771 --> 00:20:23.340
so you're gonna have to assume
that she is non-ambulatory,


315
00:20:23.505 --> 00:20:25.778
so you're gonna have
to bring stuff to carry her out.
