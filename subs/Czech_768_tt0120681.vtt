birth to the Twentieth Century.

[London, 1888]

4
00:02:17.059 --> 00:02:18.936
[Man]
You just get out of here!


5
00:02:19.061 --> 00:02:21.897
Oh, please!
I beg of you!


6
00:02:23.149 --> 00:02:25.068
That won't hold up.

7
00:02:25.151 --> 00:02:28.529
That's no good. You can throw
that right away. Start again.


8
00:02:32.408 --> 00:02:34.452
Easy!

[Whitechapel District]

10
00:02:46.881 --> 00:02:49.300
You're bloody drinkin'
all our money again!


11
00:02:49.425 --> 00:02:52.345
- I'll kick your bleedin' ass!
- All our bloody savings!


12
00:02:52.428 --> 00:02:54.347
What do you say, darling?

13
00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:57.350
Gonna have a hell of a holiday
identifying that!


14
00:03:03.564 --> 00:03:05.483
You needn't fear.

15
00:03:05.566 --> 00:03:08.486
That's it. You'll feel
better when you get to--


16
00:03:12.448 --> 00:03:14.325
We warned you!

17
00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:16.327
- What is this?

18
00:03:16.452 --> 00:03:19.330
This'll be
the last warning you get!


19
00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:26.128
- Good night, Polly.
- Gonna be a long night, Mary.


20
00:03:26.212 --> 00:03:28.131
Too bloody long.

21
00:03:34.053 --> 00:03:36.472
- It's quiet, isn't it?
- Like the devil's laugh.


22
00:03:36.555 --> 00:03:39.475
- You had any luck?
- No, not very much.


23
00:03:47.024 --> 00:03:49.944
- A penny for a suck.
- Piss off.


24
00:03:51.862 --> 00:03:53.781
- Where's Kate?
- Across the street.


25
00:03:55.074 --> 00:03:56.951
Take it easy, now.

26
00:03:57.076 --> 00:03:58.953
Here we are.

27
00:03:59.078 --> 00:04:01.455
Slow down.

28
00:04:01.497 --> 00:04:04.750
- Miss? Mary, isn't it?
- Yeah? What do you want?


29
00:04:04.875 --> 00:04:06.418
Shut your hole, bitch.

30
00:04:06.502 --> 00:04:10.006
I know you.
You're Geordie from Nichol Street.


31
00:04:10.131 --> 00:04:12.884
Do you remember me, Mary Kelly?

32
00:04:13.008 --> 00:04:15.010
I'd never forget you, McQueen.

33
00:04:18.055 --> 00:04:20.391
You stop that now.
Buttons are hard to come by.


34
00:04:22.643 --> 00:04:24.687
What does a whore
need buttons for?


35
00:04:24.812 --> 00:04:29.608
I warned you and your friends
payment was expected Monday.


36
00:04:29.692 --> 00:04:32.695
I'm working, ain't I?
We all are.


37
00:04:33.904 --> 00:04:36.615
And I ... am makin' sure ...

38
00:04:36.699 --> 00:04:40.244
that no one troubles you.

39
00:04:40.369 --> 00:04:42.746
I'm providing a service, 
Mary Kelly ...

40
00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:44.874
and I expect to be paid.

41
00:04:44.999 --> 00:04:48.419
Or else you will be
very troubled.


42
00:04:48.502 --> 00:04:50.546
Now, you tell ...

43
00:04:51.464 --> 00:04:53.591
your five friends ...

44
00:04:55.259 --> 00:04:57.928
to bring me my money
by tomorrow ... 


45
00:04:58.053 --> 00:05:01.765
or this friend ofmine here
will be your next customer.


46
00:05:35.132 --> 00:05:38.135
- It's gotten hard for me, and then--
- Oh, God.


47
00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:41.472
- You're bloody filthy this morning.
- I bleedin' stink.


48
00:05:41.555 --> 00:05:43.474
What'd you get up to
last night?


49
00:05:43.557 --> 00:05:46.477
You don't wanna know about it.

50
00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:48.604
Give us a look.

51
00:05:55.569 --> 00:05:57.696
Mary!

52
00:05:57.822 --> 00:06:00.616
Oh, thank God I found you.

53
00:06:00.741 --> 00:06:03.035
He's comin'.
Albert's comin' today.


54
00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:05.621
And, well, I need you
to look after the baby.


55
00:06:06.997 --> 00:06:09.249
Let's have a hold.
Ohh!


56
00:06:09.333 --> 00:06:11.961
I'm so proud ofher.
I love her to bits.


57
00:06:12.086 --> 00:06:14.046
She's the most gorgeous
little girl.


58
00:06:14.171 --> 00:06:16.882
-Isn't she beautiful?
-She's so beautiful.


59
00:06:16.966 --> 00:06:18.885
She's lovely, isn't she?

60
00:06:18.968 --> 00:06:20.803
I'll be seein' you in a bit.

61
00:06:20.928 --> 00:06:22.805
Get us ajar of gin, will ya?

62
00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:25.433
- Looks like me as well.
- You look fine, Ann.


63
00:06:25.516 --> 00:06:28.811
Must be nice havin'
a rich man lookin' after ya.


64
00:06:28.936 --> 00:06:32.106
She has your eyes and her father's brow.
Don't you think?


65
00:06:32.189 --> 00:06:34.566
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah.


66
00:06:34.692 --> 00:06:38.571
She is a perfect love. But, Ann,
we're all in a terrible way for money.


67
00:06:38.696 --> 00:06:41.115
- The Nichols gang--
- They want our blood.


68
00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:43.993
- Know what they said they're gonna do?
- Don't start that now.


69
00:06:44.076 --> 00:06:45.828
Or what?
What's she saying?


70
00:06:45.911 --> 00:06:48.330
They want a pound a week
from each of us.


71
00:06:48.455 --> 00:06:53.460
You count your self lucky that you got
a wealthy man to take care of ya.


72
00:06:53.586 --> 00:06:57.632
We're needing four pound to pay him,
so I can't spare the time.


73
00:06:57.756 --> 00:07:01.051
I'll get you the four pounds
from Albert.


74
00:07:01.135 --> 00:07:04.055
- He might say no.
- He won't.


75
00:07:04.180 --> 00:07:06.057
I know he won't.

76
00:07:06.182 --> 00:07:08.559
He's been in France on business.

77
00:07:08.642 --> 00:07:11.061
He wrote he sold
a lot ofhis paintings.


78
00:07:11.187 --> 00:07:14.065
He's sure to have full pockets
and feel generous.


79
00:07:14.190 --> 00:07:16.234
- To you, perhaps, but--
- I'll ask for meself.


80
00:07:16.358 --> 00:07:20.028
I'll get you the four pounds.
I promise, Mary.


81
00:07:29.788 --> 00:07:32.708
I'm not gonna hurt you, Netley.

82
00:07:32.791 --> 00:07:34.710
Remember me?

83
00:07:34.793 --> 00:07:36.712
Remember who I am?

84
00:07:38.172 --> 00:07:41.008
Your charge will be coming down
sooner than expected.


85
00:07:41.133 --> 00:07:44.011
Much sooner than expected.

86
00:07:44.136 --> 00:07:47.014
Be a good man, Netley.
Get him home quickly.


87
00:07:47.139 --> 00:07:50.184
Quickly and quietly.
Understood?


88
00:07:53.062 --> 00:07:54.981
Well said, Netley.

89
00:07:55.064 --> 00:07:57.984
Very well said.

90
00:08:37.022 --> 00:08:39.816
- Take them out.
- What is the meaning of this?


91
00:08:39.942 --> 00:08:44.363
- Kidney, what are you doing?
- Ohh! Albert! Aaah!


92
00:08:44.446 --> 00:08:46.573
Albert!
My baby!


93
00:08:46.699 --> 00:08:49.577
- I want this room in pieces.

94
00:08:49.702 --> 00:08:53.956
Oh, no! No!

95
00:08:55.332 --> 00:08:57.626
Release me at once!

96
00:08:57.751 --> 00:08:59.461
- I demandan explanation!
- It's Albert.


97
00:09:01.839 --> 00:09:03.466
Go!

98
00:09:05.885 --> 00:09:09.055
- Albert! Aaah!

99
00:09:09.180 --> 00:09:11.265
- Get off me! Get off me!

100
00:09:11.390 --> 00:09:13.100
Shh, shh, shh.

101
00:09:13.184 --> 00:09:15.103
- Please, no!
- Go!


102
00:09:15.186 --> 00:09:18.731
Get off!.

103
00:09:20.733 --> 00:09:22.610
Who knows?

104
00:09:24.028 --> 00:09:26.822
I didn't know.

105
00:09:26.947 --> 00:09:28.824
I swear I didn't.

106
00:09:28.949 --> 00:09:31.368
How could I tell anyone else?

107
00:09:31.452 --> 00:09:33.371
Tsk, tsk, tsk.

108
00:09:33.454 --> 00:09:35.373
Who knows?

109
00:09:39.376 --> 00:09:41.253
Who knows?

110
00:09:46.175 --> 00:09:49.261
I don't know.
I don't know who they could be.


111
00:09:49.345 --> 00:09:51.889
Albert must have mixed in
with something terrible.


112
00:09:51.972 --> 00:09:54.933
- She's hungry and cold, poor thing.

113
00:09:57.019 --> 00:10:01.190
I've got to take her to 'em.
I've got to take her to Ann's parents.


114
00:10:01.315 --> 00:10:04.401
All right, you go.
Leave Baby Alice with them.


115
00:10:04.443 --> 00:10:07.446
I'll get to work, and I'll
meet you later at the Ten Bells.


116
00:11:44.543 --> 00:11:46.295
Mostly Jews live here.

117
00:12:06.440 --> 00:12:08.817
Notice something, inspector?

118
00:12:23.916 --> 00:12:26.836
I paid.
I already paid.


119
00:12:26.919 --> 00:12:29.839
I'm not after you, Emperor.
Where is he?


120
00:12:31.924 --> 00:12:33.801
Move it!

121
00:12:33.926 --> 00:12:36.303
Hey!

122
00:12:41.267 --> 00:12:44.604
Get up.

123
00:12:46.772 --> 00:12:48.649
Get up!

124
00:12:51.443 --> 00:12:53.403
Hello, darling.

125
00:13:08.752 --> 00:13:10.671
Sergeant.

126
00:13:12.756 --> 00:13:14.675
It's night.

127
00:13:14.758 --> 00:13:18.178
Well spotted, inspector Abberline.
Indeed, it is night.


128
00:13:18.304 --> 00:13:20.223
The genius has returned to us.

129
00:13:20.306 --> 00:13:22.225
Thank you, gentlemen, and remember ...

130
00:13:22.308 --> 00:13:26.270
if you ever wish to escape the dreary
confines of your present duties ... 


131
00:13:26.395 --> 00:13:28.272
this never happened.

132
00:13:28.397 --> 00:13:30.274
Cut along, now.

133
00:13:32.485 --> 00:13:34.404
Have I lost a day?

134
00:13:34.487 --> 00:13:37.407
No, inspector. Indeed, it's only
four hours since you left here.


135
00:13:37.490 --> 00:13:41.911
Oh, deepest apologies
for the, uh, rude awakening.


136
00:13:41.994 --> 00:13:44.413
I suspect you enjoyed that.

137
00:13:44.538 --> 00:13:47.416
I must be cruel only to be kind,
as the poet said.


138
00:13:47.541 --> 00:13:51.211
Although I would happily wallop you
every time you chased the dragon.


139
00:13:51.337 --> 00:13:54.215
Well, I had a sneaking suspicion
you might interrupt.


140
00:13:54.340 --> 00:13:56.884
You've seen something.

141
00:13:57.009 --> 00:13:59.428
What did you see?

142
00:14:01.430 --> 00:14:03.933
Are her petticoats
saturated with blood?


143
00:14:05.476 --> 00:14:08.437
You know, they used to
burn men like you alive.


144
00:14:09.980 --> 00:14:12.983
Sometime this evening a bang-tail
was murdered in George Yard.


145
00:14:13.108 --> 00:14:16.111
That doesn't sound much
out of the ordinary.


146
00:14:16.195 --> 00:14:18.114
'Twas the way she was done,
inspector.


147
00:14:18.197 --> 00:14:20.533
'Twas the way
the bang-tail was done ... 


148
00:14:20.616 --> 00:14:23.536
that cries out
for a man of your talents.


149
00:14:33.337 --> 00:14:37.091
Her name was Martha Tabram. I don't
know what sort of name Tabram is.


150
00:14:38.676 --> 00:14:41.220
It sounds foreign to me.

151
00:14:41.345 --> 00:14:43.722
This is not what I saw.

152
00:14:43.806 --> 00:14:46.559
Not the woman of your dreams?

153
00:14:46.684 --> 00:14:48.728
- You sure?
- Yeah.


154
00:14:50.354 --> 00:14:52.523
- Show him.
- You show him.


155
00:14:52.606 --> 00:14:56.902
Why do I have to be exposed to this
degradation over and over again?


156
00:14:58.737 --> 00:15:00.864
I've looked at the mess twice!

157
00:15:05.452 --> 00:15:08.872
Before he cut
her throat, he removed her livelihood ... 


158
00:15:08.956 --> 00:15:10.875
as a keepsake.

159
00:15:20.676 --> 00:15:24.096
Gentlemen, we are indeed
fortunate today ... 


160
00:15:24.180 --> 00:15:27.100
to be able to observe
an entirely new approach ... 


161
00:15:27.224 --> 00:15:29.935
to the treatment of insanity.

162
00:15:30.019 --> 00:15:32.021
It is-
- Oh, Dr. Ferral.

163
00:15:32.146 --> 00:15:36.067
I was just saying, we're here
in the hope that you will permit us ... 


164
00:15:36.150 --> 00:15:38.069
to observe
this new treatment of yours.


165
00:15:38.152 --> 00:15:41.364
Well, I wasn't expecting such
distinguished visitors, Sir William.


166
00:15:41.447 --> 00:15:43.991
But you're all welcome, of course.

167
00:15:44.074 --> 00:15:45.826
I'm ready to begin right now.

168
00:15:45.910 --> 00:15:48.329
- Who is your patient?
- Ann Crook.


169
00:15:48.454 --> 00:15:50.831
An unfortunate, 
Sir William ...

170
00:15:50.956 --> 00:15:53.375
who's hysterical and violent ...

171
00:15:53.459 --> 00:15:55.878
and has severe delusions
of persecution.


172
00:15:55.961 --> 00:15:59.256
Oh, poor girl.
Uh, do please proceed, Dr. Ferral.


173
00:16:00.466 --> 00:16:03.219
Gentlemen.

174
00:16:51.058 --> 00:16:53.477
We have one tap above ...

175
00:16:57.565 --> 00:16:59.609
and one into the left lobe ...

176
00:17:03.404 --> 00:17:05.114
and ...

177
00:17:05.197 --> 00:17:07.116
one on the right ...

178
00:17:08.367 --> 00:17:11.537
and this unlucky patient's dementia ...

179
00:17:11.620 --> 00:17:13.664
will no longer takea violent form.

180
00:17:13.789 --> 00:17:17.209
Thanks to this simple procedure ...

181
00:17:17.293 --> 00:17:21.047
we can now permanently alleviate
the poor girl's suffering.


182
00:17:26.719 --> 00:17:30.139
What could I do? I had to
leave the baby with Ann's parents.


183
00:17:30.264 --> 00:17:32.141
Rich man. Thought he was
gonna take care of Ann.


184
00:17:32.266 --> 00:17:35.186
Knew that was
too bloody good to be true.


185
00:17:35.269 --> 00:17:37.646
They're gonna kill
every one of us.


186
00:17:37.771 --> 00:17:40.148
Who is this Albert, anyway?
Who is he?


187
00:17:40.232 --> 00:17:43.652
Oh, for God's sake, who cares
about Albert and Ann's troubles?


188
00:17:43.777 --> 00:17:47.781
What are we gonna do? We can't
stay clear of the Nichols boys forever.


189
00:17:47.907 --> 00:17:50.827
You know, they say
they held poor Martha down ... 


190
00:17:50.910 --> 00:17:54.831
and watched her bleed until she
passed out, and then cut her throat.


191
00:17:54.914 --> 00:17:57.458
- Oh! Shocking.
- McQueen is mad.


192
00:17:57.541 --> 00:17:59.460
He enjoys hurting women.

193
00:17:59.543 --> 00:18:03.422
That's insane. They want four pounds.
How we gonna get four pounds?


194
00:18:03.506 --> 00:18:06.718
Not with my old cunny.
I'd be lucky to get four pence.


195
00:18:08.010 --> 00:18:10.930
Oi, oi, oi!
Behave yourselves or bugger off!.


196
00:18:11.013 --> 00:18:12.932
Yeah, you can bugger off..

197
00:18:13.015 --> 00:18:15.434
We work, girls.

198
00:18:15.476 --> 00:18:18.437
We work the streets
harder than ever.


199
00:18:18.479 --> 00:18:21.065
Right? Right?

200
00:18:23.192 --> 00:18:26.070
All right, we can do it here.
But hurry up.


201
00:18:26.195 --> 00:18:28.072
The bobbies are fussing us tonight.

202
00:18:28.197 --> 00:18:31.075
All right. Gotta get
the old man off first, right?


203
00:18:31.200 --> 00:18:34.120
- Give it here. I'll put it in meself.
- Oh, that's ni--


204
00:18:34.203 --> 00:18:36.122
Ooh!

205
00:18:36.205 --> 00:18:38.124
- Eh?
- Yeah, yeah.


206
00:18:38.207 --> 00:18:40.584
- Is it in?
- Of course it is. Come on.


207
00:18:40.709 --> 00:18:43.587
No, it's not. You got it
stuck between your bleedin' legs.


208
00:18:43.712 --> 00:18:47.132
- No, I haven't. Come on, get a move on.
- I knows it when I feels it.


209
00:18:58.978 --> 00:19:01.856
- Oh!
- That's mine, Polly.


210
00:19:01.939 --> 00:19:04.525
That's my money.

211
00:19:08.362 --> 00:19:10.865
I could pop your eye out.

212
00:19:10.948 --> 00:19:12.450
Customers wouldn't mind.

213
00:19:12.533 --> 00:19:16.328
They don't mind
if a whore can't see.


214
00:19:17.663 --> 00:19:19.540
- What's that?

215
00:19:19.665 --> 00:19:21.709
What have I got here?

216
00:19:21.834 --> 00:19:24.503
What have I got here, Constable?
Only a little thing.


217
00:19:24.587 --> 00:19:28.007
Only a little thing to you,
but a great thing to me.


218
00:19:28.132 --> 00:19:31.385
Move, or I'll bash
that smart mouth.


219
00:19:33.345 --> 00:19:35.264
You're a dead woman.

220
00:19:43.439 --> 00:19:46.859
- He won't bother you again tonight.
- Yeah, that's right.


221
00:19:46.942 --> 00:19:49.862
Look, one for the Nichols. Yeah?

222
00:19:49.945 --> 00:19:52.698
- And one for me. Right?

223
00:19:52.781 --> 00:19:54.866
Oh. Come here. Come here.

224
00:19:54.950 --> 00:19:57.161
Hey. Shh.

225
00:19:57.286 --> 00:19:59.497
Hey, we work the streets together.

226
00:19:59.580 --> 00:20:01.999
I'll keep my eye on you, love, eh?

227
00:20:07.129 --> 00:20:09.214
Oh, you pig!

228
00:20:09.298 --> 00:20:11.217
You disgusting pig!

229
00:20:14.386 --> 00:20:16.430
Yeah, I'm a pig.

230
00:20:16.514 --> 00:20:19.434
I'm what's wrong with the world.

231
00:20:19.517 --> 00:20:21.394
Be on your own, then.

232
00:20:21.477 --> 00:20:23.729
Oh, no!

233
00:20:23.854 --> 00:20:26.732
You don't want the company of a pig!

234
00:20:28.067 --> 00:20:30.444
What the fuck are you lookin' at?

235
00:20:30.528 --> 00:20:32.447
I slept with you!

236
00:20:47.336 --> 00:20:49.255
Thirsty?

237
00:20:49.338 --> 00:20:51.257
Mmm.

238
00:20:54.343 --> 00:20:57.263
That was the thing
that was in my dream.


239
00:20:57.346 --> 00:20:59.265
What's it called again?

240
00:20:59.390 --> 00:21:01.434
Cleopatra's Needle.

241
00:21:01.517 --> 00:21:03.436
Mmm. Cleopatra.

242
00:21:03.519 --> 00:21:05.438
She was a beauty, wasn't she?

243
00:21:05.563 --> 00:21:11.152
It was carved 1 , 500 years
before the Son of God was born.


244
00:21:11.277 --> 00:21:13.196
Mmm.

245
00:21:13.279 --> 00:21:16.199
Six men died to
bring it here ...

246
00:21:16.282 --> 00:21:18.201
from Egypt.

247
00:22:20.387 --> 00:22:23.307
May the Good Lord have mercy.

248
00:22:36.654 --> 00:22:39.532
She was like that when I found her--
all murdered.


249
00:22:39.657 --> 00:22:42.535
What kind of monster did this?

250
00:22:42.660 --> 00:22:45.538
- Woman, I told you.
- Who was the first to see her?


251
00:22:48.207 --> 00:22:52.378
You go in. Keep to the streets.
Settle back, now.


252
00:22:54.255 --> 00:22:56.966
The boys have made their rounds of the
taverns and the delightful domiciles ... 


253
00:22:57.049 --> 00:22:59.760
that make up
this charming little street.


254
00:22:59.844 --> 00:23:02.263
Would it surprise you to learn
that nobody heard a sound?


255
00:23:02.346 --> 00:23:05.558
Throat was cut, but there's
no arterial spray on the wall.


256
00:23:05.683 --> 00:23:08.436
She was killed somewhere else.

257
00:23:12.523 --> 00:23:15.317
- It rained last night, didn't it?
- Mm-hmm.


258
00:23:17.653 --> 00:23:19.530
She's dry.

259
00:23:20.865 --> 00:23:23.409
She was brought here
in a carriage or something.


260
00:23:23.534 --> 00:23:25.953
Throat must have been cut
in the carriage.


261
00:23:26.036 --> 00:23:28.247
I imagine they stopped it
just over there.


262
00:23:28.372 --> 00:23:29.540
"They"?

263
00:23:29.540 --> 00:23:30.458
"They"?

264
00:23:30.583 --> 00:23:34.295
- There's more than one, then.
- Most definitely.


265
00:23:35.462 --> 00:23:37.589
This was all in your vision?

266
00:23:37.673 --> 00:23:40.467
-Take your missus home.

267
00:23:40.593 --> 00:23:42.929
Where were the coppers last night?

268
00:23:43.053 --> 00:23:45.264
Oh, Jesus.

269
00:23:45.347 --> 00:23:47.724
So ...

270
00:23:47.850 --> 00:23:49.727
definitely more than one person.

271
00:23:49.852 --> 00:23:52.730
Has to be a message from
the Nichols boys. Am I right?


272
00:23:55.232 --> 00:23:57.025
What the hell?

273
00:23:57.151 --> 00:23:59.111
That's grapes, isn't it?

274
00:23:59.236 --> 00:24:02.448
What the hell would a bang-tail
be doing with grapes?


275
00:24:46.742 --> 00:24:49.662
I'd like to give them an answer.

276
00:24:49.745 --> 00:24:52.164
- What are you talking about?
- The Nichols boys.


277
00:24:52.289 --> 00:24:54.166
I would welcome the opportunity ...

278
00:24:54.291 --> 00:24:57.169
to give them an answer
to their bloody message.


279
00:24:57.294 --> 00:24:59.630
There is most definitely
a message here.


280
00:24:59.755 --> 00:25:02.549
- You're right about that.
- And what am I wrong about?


281
00:25:04.343 --> 00:25:08.681
Martha Tabram was raped,
tortured and killed.


282
00:25:08.806 --> 00:25:10.683
That's cruel.

283
00:25:10.808 --> 00:25:13.686
But I've seen that sort of cruelty
in the East End before.


284
00:25:15.437 --> 00:25:18.023
This is methodical.

285
00:25:18.149 --> 00:25:20.068
The butchery's irrational ...

286
00:25:20.151 --> 00:25:22.528
yet meticulous and deliberate.

287
00:25:25.739 --> 00:25:28.158
Altogether a different
breed of killer.


288
00:25:30.619 --> 00:25:33.539
As soon as possible
I'd like to know what he took.


289
00:25:33.622 --> 00:25:36.917
What? What do you mean,
what he took?


290
00:25:37.001 --> 00:25:39.879
- Didn't you notice?
- What?


291
00:25:40.004 --> 00:25:42.381
He's taken at least one
ofher organs.


292
00:25:42.465 --> 00:25:44.384
Oh, no.

293
00:25:51.932 --> 00:25:55.477
I want every veterinarian,
butcher ... 


294
00:25:55.603 --> 00:25:58.481
and furrier in the district
interviewed.


295
00:25:58.606 --> 00:26:01.109
Furrier? What did he do, sir?
Skin her?


296
00:26:01.233 --> 00:26:03.944
- Pipe down, Withers.

297
00:26:04.069 --> 00:26:07.990
When the inspector is talking,
you are listening. Do you understand?


298
00:26:08.073 --> 00:26:10.075
Yes, Sergeant.

299
00:26:10.201 --> 00:26:13.079
He disemboweled her.

300
00:26:13.204 --> 00:26:16.582
After he cut her throat,
he stabbed her in the chest ... 


301
00:26:16.665 --> 00:26:18.584
cut open her stomach ...

302
00:26:18.667 --> 00:26:21.003
and, uh, took out her intestines.

303
00:26:24.340 --> 00:26:27.385
At least one
ofher organs was removed.


304
00:26:27.468 --> 00:26:30.888
I'm waiting for the police surgeon's
report for more details.


305
00:26:34.016 --> 00:26:35.601
I see.

306
00:26:36.894 --> 00:26:38.771
Well, one thing's for certain:

307
00:26:38.896 --> 00:26:40.689
an Englishman didn't do it.

308
00:26:43.442 --> 00:26:47.613
Maybe one of these red indians ...

309
00:26:47.738 --> 00:26:51.533
wandered into Whitechapel
and indulged his natural inclinations.


310
00:26:54.370 --> 00:26:56.455
With all due respect, sir ...

311
00:26:56.580 --> 00:26:58.457
I believe this was
done by someone ...

312
00:26:58.582 --> 00:27:00.834
with at least
a working knowledge of dissection.


313
00:27:00.960 --> 00:27:03.880
- An educated man, such as a doctor--
- An educated man?


314
00:27:03.963 --> 00:27:07.341
That's preposterous.
No well-bred man would do this.


315
00:27:08.676 --> 00:27:11.137
Probably a tradesman or a butcher.

316
00:27:11.220 --> 00:27:14.557
A tradesman is
a possibility, sir, yes.


317
00:27:15.766 --> 00:27:18.727
But there's a strong
indication against it.


318
00:27:18.811 --> 00:27:21.314
There was a sprig of grapes
found under her body.


319
00:27:21.397 --> 00:27:22.815
What are you driving at?

320
00:27:22.898 --> 00:27:27.027
No one in White chapel,
no matter what their trade ... 


321
00:27:27.153 --> 00:27:28.821
could afford grapes.

322
00:27:28.904 --> 00:27:31.198
Obviously they were
given to herby the killer.


323
00:27:31.282 --> 00:27:34.452
And it follows that
he must be someone with money.


324
00:27:34.577 --> 00:27:38.247
What about the Jews?
A Jew butcher.


325
00:27:38.372 --> 00:27:40.958
Or a Jew tailor
might have money.


326
00:27:41.083 --> 00:27:42.960
There are plenty of them
in Whitechapel.


327
00:27:43.085 --> 00:27:46.380
Well, sir, for the sake
of public safety in general ... 


328
00:27:46.464 --> 00:27:50.385
I'd like to be careful about spreading
the rumors that it might be a Jew.


329
00:27:51.760 --> 00:27:53.637
Inspector, I know your reputation ...

330
00:27:53.762 --> 00:27:56.640
for making brilliant guesses
that turn out to be right.


331
00:27:56.765 --> 00:28:00.394
Someone told me you claimed
to dream the answers.


332
00:28:00.436 --> 00:28:03.940
Frankly, it doesn't matter to me
what your methods are.


333
00:28:04.064 --> 00:28:07.192
But be certain you don't
proceed without proof.


334
00:28:07.318 --> 00:28:09.445
- Is that clear?
- Of course, sir.


335
00:28:09.528 --> 00:28:11.447
Personally, I don't care.

336
00:28:11.530 --> 00:28:14.408
The fewer pinch-pricks
on the streets, the better.


337
00:28:14.492 --> 00:28:18.871
But the sooner you find
this butcher or tailor, inspector ... 


338
00:28:18.996 --> 00:28:22.500
the sooner we can all
celebrate your promotion.


339
00:28:23.626 --> 00:28:25.878
Keep me informed.

340
00:28:28.798 --> 00:28:38.798
[ ... throat cut ...
distinct cuts being ... ]

341
00:28:40.976 --> 00:28:43.896
He didn't know nothin'!

342
00:28:43.979 --> 00:28:46.899
Bloody Jew did it!
It's gotta be!


343
00:28:46.982 --> 00:28:50.903
Murdering kikes!

344
00:28:50.986 --> 00:28:53.906
Every cellar!
Every stable!


345
00:28:53.989 --> 00:28:55.908
We'll find him out!

346
00:28:55.991 --> 00:28:57.910
Some bleedin' Jew! Come on!

347
00:28:57.993 --> 00:29:00.787
That's enough!
Let's burn 'em out!


348
00:31:00.574 --> 00:31:02.701
I have wonderful news.

349
00:31:02.827 --> 00:31:04.704
Tell me.

350
00:31:04.829 --> 00:31:07.498
Surely you, of all people,
can guess.


351
00:31:07.581 --> 00:31:10.501
I don't want to guess with you.

352
00:31:12.002 --> 00:31:13.921
Dr. Marbury says ...

353
00:31:16.632 --> 00:31:18.551
Dr. Marbury says?

354
00:31:20.219 --> 00:31:23.597
Dr. Marbury says
I'm going to have your child.


355
00:31:54.420 --> 00:31:57.465
Aye, to die ...

356
00:31:57.590 --> 00:31:59.592
and go we know not where ...

357
00:31:59.717 --> 00:32:02.595
but to lie in cold obstruction
and to rot.


358
00:32:05.347 --> 00:32:08.267
A simple"rest in peace"
would suffice, Godley.


359
00:32:08.350 --> 00:32:10.269
Yes, sir.

360
00:32:10.352 --> 00:32:13.272
In the midst of life
we are in death.


361
00:32:13.355 --> 00:32:16.900
Of whom may we seek for succor
but of thee, O Lord ... 


362
00:32:16.984 --> 00:32:19.945
who, for our sins,
are justly displeased?


363
00:32:20.070 --> 00:32:24.408
Yet, O Lord, Godmost holy,
O Lord most mighty--


364
00:32:38.881 --> 00:32:41.133
Good afternoon, ladies.

365
00:32:41.258 --> 00:32:44.136
I'm inspector Abberline.
This is Sergeant Godley.


366
00:32:44.261 --> 00:32:48.098
We're investigating the murders
of Polly Nichols and Martha Tabram.


367
00:32:48.182 --> 00:32:50.976
Yes, we understand that they
were both friends of you ladies.


368
00:32:51.101 --> 00:32:54.479
Close friends. We're rather hoping
you'dbe able to help us out.


369
00:32:54.563 --> 00:32:56.482
Don't know nothing.

370
00:32:56.565 --> 00:32:58.484
Me neither.

371
00:32:58.609 --> 00:33:01.737
Why you botherin' us?
You ought to be botherin' McQueen.


372
00:33:01.862 --> 00:33:04.782
- Is he the boss on Nichol Street?
- He's the heart and soul of the gang.


373
00:33:04.907 --> 00:33:07.827
Isn't it your job
to be knowin' that small detail?


374
00:33:10.329 --> 00:33:13.249
And what makes you think McQueen
did this to your friends?


375
00:33:13.332 --> 00:33:15.334
Can't prove nothing by me.

376
00:33:17.461 --> 00:33:20.005
- You're Mary Kelly. Is that right?
- That's right.


377
00:33:20.131 --> 00:33:23.801
Well, Mary Kelly, unless one of you
is willing to testify against McQueen ... 


378
00:33:23.926 --> 00:33:26.595
I can't do nothing.

379
00:33:26.720 --> 00:33:28.597
Surely, inspector ...

380
00:33:28.722 --> 00:33:30.849
a strong, handsome man like you ...

381
00:33:30.975 --> 00:33:33.853
you could do anything
you putyour brilliant mind to.


382
00:33:35.729 --> 00:33:39.733
I'm a coward and a weakling and I can't
help meself. What's your excuse?


383
00:33:39.859 --> 00:33:42.278
Why are you so bloody useless?

384
00:33:45.865 --> 00:33:48.826
Come on, Mary.
That won't help us.


385
00:34:12.183 --> 00:34:14.018
Is that you?

386
00:34:16.103 --> 00:34:19.398
Before my mother died,
back in Ireland.


387
00:34:19.482 --> 00:34:21.734
- Is that when you came here?
- Yeah.


388
00:34:21.859 --> 00:34:24.236
When I was eight.

389
00:34:24.320 --> 00:34:26.239
When things was good.

390
00:34:26.322 --> 00:34:30.243
We were starvin',
but we were starvin' in fresh air.


391
00:34:32.495 --> 00:34:34.914
I was thinking ...

392
00:34:34.997 --> 00:34:38.209
we ain't ever gonna earn enough
to satisfy the Nichols boys ... 


393
00:34:38.334 --> 00:34:40.086
and feed our own mouths.

394
00:34:42.213 --> 00:34:44.966
You said, right--
You said those men, yeah?


395
00:34:45.049 --> 00:34:48.427
The ones who took her rich artist man
and who took her as well.


396
00:34:48.552 --> 00:34:52.806
You said they was clean shaven
and their clothes was neat.


397
00:34:52.890 --> 00:34:55.976
- Yeah, right.
- Well, they weren't no criminals then.


398
00:34:56.101 --> 00:34:58.979
I mean, they weren't the likes
ofthe Nichols boys.


399
00:34:59.104 --> 00:35:00.856
They was unusual.

400
00:35:00.981 --> 00:35:02.900
Perhaps even official.

401
00:35:03.025 --> 00:35:04.735
What are you gettin' at, Annie?

402
00:35:06.737 --> 00:35:09.031
Maybe we could go with the papers.

403
00:35:09.156 --> 00:35:11.033
Get paid for the story, you know.

404
00:35:11.158 --> 00:35:13.494
"Where is Ann Crook?"
That sort of thing.


405
00:35:13.577 --> 00:35:16.163
The papers are always desperate
for things bad about the government.


406
00:35:16.288 --> 00:35:17.915
And it's a mystery to boot.

407
00:35:17.998 --> 00:35:20.334
It's not a bad plan.
What do you think, Mary?


408
00:35:20.417 --> 00:35:23.837
I'm thinkin' we should talk to that
inspector, the one at Polly's funeral.


409
00:35:23.921 --> 00:35:25.840
Oh, fuck me, no!

410
00:35:25.923 --> 00:35:29.844
If we go to the papers they might
hurt Ann or do something to her baby.


411
00:35:29.927 --> 00:35:33.597
What, worse than what'll happen to her
in Whitechapel when she sprouts teats?


412
00:35:33.722 --> 00:35:38.185
I don't know for sure, but I think we're
better off talkin' to that inspector.


413
00:35:38.310 --> 00:35:41.730
Lord, you are young after all.

414
00:35:44.275 --> 00:35:47.612
Four bitches.
That's what I thought.


415
00:35:47.736 --> 00:35:49.988
You only paid
for one bloody person.


416
00:35:50.114 --> 00:35:51.991
- They're my guests.
- Guests?


417
00:35:52.116 --> 00:35:54.660
Well, let me welcome your guests.

418
00:35:54.785 --> 00:35:57.579
- Go on, get out!

419
00:35:57.663 --> 00:35:59.582
Go on, get out!

420
00:35:59.707 --> 00:36:03.002
Get out ofhere, you bloody whores!
Go on!


421
00:36:03.085 --> 00:36:05.004
When you have four pence ...

422
00:36:05.087 --> 00:36:09.383
you can come back with your
ladies-in-waitin', Your Grace.


423
00:36:09.508 --> 00:36:11.385
Oh, shut up!

424
00:36:11.510 --> 00:36:13.387
Ow!

425
00:36:13.512 --> 00:36:15.389
Back to work, then.

426
00:36:15.514 --> 00:36:18.392
- Well, let's try and stay together.
- You know we can't.


427
00:36:18.517 --> 00:36:21.353
Then stay good and clear
of Nichol Street.


428
00:36:21.479 --> 00:36:23.356
Come on!

429
00:36:24.565 --> 00:36:26.484
- All right, Annie?
- Ehh.


430
00:36:26.609 --> 00:36:28.486
Bloody bastard.

431
00:36:28.611 --> 00:36:30.488
- How's your head?
- Oh, very funny!


432
00:37:46.689 --> 00:37:48.608
Hyah!

433
00:38:29.982 --> 00:38:32.359
Boo!

434
00:38:34.945 --> 00:38:36.822
I didn't frighten you, did I?

435
00:38:38.574 --> 00:38:40.451
I been lookin' for ya.

436
00:38:40.576 --> 00:38:42.495
I been lookin' all over for ya.

437
00:38:42.620 --> 00:38:44.831
You been looking for me?

438
00:38:44.955 --> 00:38:47.875
Not for me.
On behalf of my gentleman.


439
00:38:47.958 --> 00:38:50.878
A very fine gentleman.
He sent me to find ya.


440
00:38:50.961 --> 00:38:53.755
Your gentleman sent you to find me?

441
00:38:53.881 --> 00:38:57.760
Oh, get off. I might be unfortunate,
but I'm not a blitherin' idiot.


442
00:38:57.885 --> 00:39:00.304
It's the truth.
It's the God's truth.


443
00:39:01.514 --> 00:39:03.474
He seen ya.
He likes ya.


444
00:39:03.557 --> 00:39:06.685
And he said tonight only you'll do.

445
00:39:08.145 --> 00:39:11.023
So he said to find ya,
take ya to Hanover Street ... 


446
00:39:11.148 --> 00:39:13.442
where he's waitin' for ya.

447
00:39:13.567 --> 00:39:16.361
- You're very pretty.

448
00:39:18.572 --> 00:39:21.325
Go on, then, get in.
I'll take you there.


449
00:39:21.450 --> 00:39:23.744
Oh, I almost forgot.

450
00:39:23.869 --> 00:39:27.539
My gentleman got you a present.
You like grapes?


451
00:39:27.665 --> 00:39:29.542
Yeah.

452
00:39:32.086 --> 00:39:34.964
Whoa!

453
00:39:35.089 --> 00:39:39.135
Your gentleman,
he must be very refined.


454
00:39:39.260 --> 00:39:41.471
- Very refined indeed.
- Get in.


455
00:39:41.554 --> 00:39:44.807
- I'll take you there.
- All right.


456
00:39:54.900 --> 00:39:56.819
Here we are.

457
00:40:05.327 --> 00:40:08.205
- I'm like a lady.
- You are a lady.


458
00:40:08.330 --> 00:40:11.375
Your gaffer,
does he want anything special?


459
00:40:11.500 --> 00:40:14.378
Just the usual, I expect.

460
00:40:14.503 --> 00:40:17.756
Now, this alley
takes you to a yard.


461
00:40:17.840 --> 00:40:19.717
My gentleman, he's quiet.

462
00:40:19.800 --> 00:40:21.719
He doesn't like disturbances.

463
00:40:22.803 --> 00:40:24.888
What I wanna know, right ...

464
00:40:25.014 --> 00:40:28.559
is a toff like him,
how much is he offerin'?


465
00:40:30.269 --> 00:40:32.146
Here. Two florin.

466
00:40:32.271 --> 00:40:34.148
That'll do me.

467
00:40:34.273 --> 00:40:36.609
Let me see ya. Go on.

468
00:40:36.692 --> 00:40:38.611
- Down here?
- Yeah.


469
00:40:38.694 --> 00:40:42.072
Straight down.
Straight down to the door at the end.


470
00:40:42.156 --> 00:40:44.325
Shh.

471
00:40:44.366 --> 00:40:45.868
Shh.

472
00:40:45.993 --> 00:40:47.870
Straight down there, yeah?

473
00:40:49.997 --> 00:40:51.874
Oops.

474
00:40:54.460 --> 00:40:56.379
No!

475
00:41:16.816 --> 00:41:19.235
-Bugger off!.

476
00:41:19.318 --> 00:41:21.237
You watch your mouth!

477
00:41:22.696 --> 00:41:24.573
Anymore information?

478
00:41:24.698 --> 00:41:27.618
- My readers wanna know this stuff..
- Oh, do they?


479
00:41:27.701 --> 00:41:30.120
Found a piece of leather apron
in her mouth?


480
00:41:30.246 --> 00:41:32.415
No, Mr. Best,
but if it's your fancy ... 


481
00:41:32.540 --> 00:41:35.960
I'd be delighted to stuff your mouth
with a piece of leather.


482
00:41:36.085 --> 00:41:39.005
Come on, give us a tip.
Put your picture on the front page.


483
00:41:39.129 --> 00:41:40.881
Cover-up!

484
00:41:41.006 --> 00:41:44.176
You're supposed to do something
about it! This is ridiculous!


485
00:41:44.301 --> 00:41:46.929
There'sableeding
murderer on the loose!


486
00:41:47.054 --> 00:41:48.931
What about my wife?

487
00:42:20.796 --> 00:42:23.090
This is Annie.

488
00:42:23.215 --> 00:42:26.135
Yes. Another of
the circle of friends.


489
00:42:26.260 --> 00:42:29.305
Annie Chapman.
DarkAnnie, they called her.


490
00:42:29.346 --> 00:42:33.058
You still say this
isn't the Nichols boys?


491
00:42:34.977 --> 00:42:37.980
Did the constable show you the leather
they found down by the water spout?


492
00:42:38.063 --> 00:42:40.983
Could be part of a butcher's apron.

493
00:42:41.066 --> 00:42:43.986
Leatherapron. Dear God.

494
00:42:44.069 --> 00:42:46.863
We could be looking
for a butcher after all.


495
00:42:46.947 --> 00:42:49.575
I saw her.

496
00:42:49.700 --> 00:42:51.660
- This one?
- Yeah. Last night.


497
00:42:53.537 --> 00:42:55.205
I saw her face.

498
00:42:59.877 --> 00:43:02.213
Don't trample over this area.

499
00:43:02.296 --> 00:43:04.882
Let us see the body!

500
00:43:04.965 --> 00:43:07.676
- Come on, let us see!
- Oh, God.


501
00:43:07.802 --> 00:43:09.220
There's your typical Londoner ...

502
00:43:09.303 --> 00:43:12.223
imbued with the Christian spirit
of sym pathy for his fellow man.


503
00:43:12.306 --> 00:43:14.475
Or fellow whore, in this case.

504
00:43:14.600 --> 00:43:17.394
He's really out done himself
this time, hasn't he?


505
00:43:17.478 --> 00:43:19.397
He not only severed the intestines ...

506
00:43:19.522 --> 00:43:22.316
he carefully arranged them
around the neck and shoulders.


507
00:43:22.358 --> 00:43:25.570
I think he's taken
more organs this time.


508
00:43:31.742 --> 00:43:34.411
Grapes again. Why grapes?

509
00:43:35.621 --> 00:43:38.541
Only Polly and Dark Annie
were given grapes.


510
00:43:38.624 --> 00:43:42.128
Only they were disemboweled
in such a meticulous fashion.


511
00:43:42.253 --> 00:43:44.630
This ain't killing for profit.

512
00:43:46.257 --> 00:43:48.176
This is ritual.

513
00:43:48.300 --> 00:43:49.885
Yeah, but why grapes?

514
00:43:59.186 --> 00:44:01.021
So they'll trust whatever he offers.

515
00:44:12.575 --> 00:44:14.827
I've never fully understood
that tradition.


516
00:44:14.910 --> 00:44:16.370
They're for the ferryman ...

517
00:44:16.453 --> 00:44:20.332
who takes the body across the river
into the land of the dead.


518
00:44:20.416 --> 00:44:23.836
If she don't have
the money to pay him ... 


519
00:44:23.919 --> 00:44:27.881
she'd have to wander forever,
lost between the two worlds.


520
00:44:35.222 --> 00:44:37.766
I need to consult a doctor.

521
00:44:37.892 --> 00:44:39.519
Are you ill, inspector?

522
00:44:39.602 --> 00:44:41.854
A surgeon, to be specific.

523
00:44:41.979 --> 00:44:45.774
The killer removed the victim's uterus
and its attachments.


524
00:44:45.858 --> 00:44:48.652
My God.
He's out of his mind.


525
00:44:48.777 --> 00:44:51.280
That's very astute of you, sir.

526
00:44:51.405 --> 00:44:54.283
I don't appreciate sarcasm, inspector.

527
00:44:54.366 --> 00:44:56.785
I'm sorry, sir.
I meant nothing by it.


528
00:44:56.869 --> 00:44:59.622
You already have a surgeon
at your disposal.


529
00:44:59.747 --> 00:45:03.209
I need a man with a strong stomach
and a sober mind.


530
00:45:03.292 --> 00:45:05.336
The police surgeon has neither.

531
00:45:05.461 --> 00:45:08.339
- No. Request denied.
- Why?


532
00:45:08.464 --> 00:45:10.341
Are you questioning my decision?

533
00:45:10.466 --> 00:45:12.635
No, sir.
I simply want to know why.


534
00:45:12.760 --> 00:45:15.721
There's already too much nonsense
and gossip in the press.


535
00:45:15.805 --> 00:45:17.724
You start consulting doctors ...

536
00:45:17.807 --> 00:45:20.476
and all sorts of wild notions
will be printed.


537
00:45:20.601 --> 00:45:23.687
No one else is to see the bodies.

538
00:45:24.814 --> 00:45:26.691
It is my honor ...

539
00:45:26.816 --> 00:45:32.196
to present this ...
unique medical phenomenon.


540
00:45:32.279 --> 00:45:35.324
Until last week, Mr.
Joseph Merrick--

541
00:45:35.407 --> 00:45:37.326
John Merrick.

542
00:45:37.409 --> 00:45:39.328
I beg your pardon.

543
00:45:39.411 --> 00:45:41.288
Mr. John Merrick ...

544
00:45:41.372 --> 00:45:44.000
was an attraction at a sideshow.

545
00:45:44.124 --> 00:45:46.293
Now he's being cared for ...

546
00:45:46.418 --> 00:45:49.713
at England's leading hospital ...

547
00:45:49.797 --> 00:45:51.716
and with your generosity ...

548
00:45:51.799 --> 00:45:54.969
we will be able
to continue to do so.


549
00:45:56.137 --> 00:45:59.015
Ladies and gentlemen ...

550
00:45:59.140 --> 00:46:01.517
Mr.John Merrick.

551
00:46:04.979 --> 00:46:06.856
Turn around.

552
00:46:13.946 --> 00:46:15.865
Oh, please.

553
00:46:15.948 --> 00:46:17.867
I can't stand it.

554
00:46:17.950 --> 00:46:20.995
Oh! He should have
been killed at birth!


555
00:46:28.294 --> 00:46:30.004
- Good health!

556
00:46:38.304 --> 00:46:41.265
That'll be the last one,
Your Royal Highness.


557
00:46:54.236 --> 00:46:58.115
These hands are a gift from God.

558
00:46:58.199 --> 00:47:00.785
- The psychotic patient is--
- Pardon, sir.


559
00:47:00.910 --> 00:47:03.371
- You Dr. Ferral?
- I am, yes.


560
00:47:03.454 --> 00:47:06.582
I'm inspector Abberline,
assigned to Whitechapel.


561
00:47:06.707 --> 00:47:09.168
- My lord, you're the Ripper case.

562
00:47:09.251 --> 00:47:11.378
- Am I right?
- Yeah.


563
00:47:11.462 --> 00:47:14.382
Jolly good.
You've come to the perfect place.


564
00:47:14.465 --> 00:47:16.801
We've got butchers aplenty here.

565
00:47:16.884 --> 00:47:18.803
- I see.

566
00:47:18.886 --> 00:47:22.598
I could use the expertise of someone
like yourself to help solve this case.


567
00:47:22.723 --> 00:47:25.601
They tell me you're
the best young surgeon in London.


568
00:47:25.726 --> 00:47:27.728
Really?

569
00:47:27.853 --> 00:47:31.774
I don't see how a reputable surgeon
could know anything about it.


570
00:47:31.857 --> 00:47:34.318
This country's over run with foreigners.

571
00:47:34.443 --> 00:47:36.403
Orientals and ...

572
00:47:36.529 --> 00:47:38.614
Jews.

573
00:47:38.739 --> 00:47:43.285
Socialists trying to stir things up
against our monarchy.


574
00:47:43.410 --> 00:47:45.454
That's who you should be pursuing.

575
00:47:45.579 --> 00:47:47.456
Don't you think?

576
00:47:47.581 --> 00:47:49.625
Excuse me.

577
00:47:49.750 --> 00:47:51.835
You don't belong here, do you?

578
00:47:54.755 --> 00:47:57.675
I'm afraid Dr. Ferral suffers
from the surgeon's malady.


579
00:47:58.759 --> 00:48:00.594
And what's that, sir?

580
00:48:00.719 --> 00:48:02.846
Want of feeling.

581
00:48:02.972 --> 00:48:05.308
He knows everything
about anatomy ... 


582
00:48:05.349 --> 00:48:07.184
and nothing about the soul.

583
00:48:08.269 --> 00:48:10.730
How may I assist you, inspector?

584
00:48:10.813 --> 00:48:13.733
Well, forgive my ignorance,
sir, but, um ... 


585
00:48:13.858 --> 00:48:15.735
are you a surgeon?

586
00:48:15.860 --> 00:48:17.737
I was.

587
00:48:17.862 --> 00:48:20.615
Unfortunately, I suffered
a brain seizure six months ago.


588
00:48:20.698 --> 00:48:26.287
- Sorry to hear that, sir.
- These days I limit myself to teaching.


589
00:48:26.370 --> 00:48:29.456
So you see, I'm accustomed
to answering questions, inspector.


590
00:48:32.001 --> 00:48:34.128
Well, sir ...

591
00:48:34.253 --> 00:48:38.632
could you tell me what sort
of a knife, uh, would this be?


592
00:48:47.016 --> 00:48:49.894
I think you mean to
draw a Liston knife.


593
00:48:50.019 --> 00:48:52.897
It's named for Liston,
who was a surgeon in the Crimean War.


594
00:48:53.022 --> 00:48:55.399
Because there was no anesthetic
on the battlefield ... 


595
00:48:55.483 --> 00:48:57.944
he had to carry out these amputations
very quickly.


596
00:48:58.068 --> 00:48:59.903
Uh ...

597
00:49:00.029 --> 00:49:03.449
do you, by any chance, have
the police surgeon's report available?


598
00:49:03.574 --> 00:49:05.493
Yes, I do, sir.

599
00:49:05.576 --> 00:49:07.495
May I?

600
00:49:07.578 --> 00:49:10.498
- We must keep this confidential.
- Of course.


601
00:49:12.708 --> 00:49:14.585
- There it is.
- Thank you.


602
00:49:19.882 --> 00:49:21.801
Hmm.

603
00:49:24.011 --> 00:49:25.888
Yes.

604
00:49:29.517 --> 00:49:31.436
Wouldn't someone
have heard their screams?


605
00:49:31.519 --> 00:49:33.980
Not if you cut their throats first.

606
00:49:35.105 --> 00:49:36.982
Yes.

607
00:49:37.107 --> 00:49:41.236
And how can you be sure they wouldn't
react to seeing the Liston knife?


608
00:49:41.320 --> 00:49:42.905
Grapes.

609
00:49:44.198 --> 00:49:46.033
He offers them grapes first.

610
00:49:46.158 --> 00:49:49.578
- Ah.
- Grapes are very tempting.


611
00:49:49.703 --> 00:49:52.289
Yes, of course.
They'd gobble them up, wouldn't they?


612
00:49:52.373 --> 00:49:55.293
And he might offer them
a drink to ease them down.


613
00:49:55.376 --> 00:49:57.128
A drink laced with laudanum.

614
00:49:58.587 --> 00:50:00.464
How do you know that?

615
00:50:00.589 --> 00:50:03.467
I found a sprig of grapes
on both victims' bodies ... 


616
00:50:03.592 --> 00:50:05.928
and I smelled the laudanum
on their lips.


617
00:50:06.053 --> 00:50:09.765
Laudanum is a derivative of opium.

618
00:50:09.890 --> 00:50:13.477
Apart from doctors and addicts,
not many would recognize it.


619
00:50:17.356 --> 00:50:20.401
How long have you
chased the dragon, inspector?


620
00:50:24.155 --> 00:50:26.574
Well, these should help
with the headaches.


621
00:50:27.700 --> 00:50:29.410
And, um ...

622
00:50:30.578 --> 00:50:33.456
opium leeches minerals
out of the body ... 


623
00:50:33.581 --> 00:50:35.625
so I've also given
you a tonic ...

624
00:50:35.749 --> 00:50:37.668
that will help to
restore your appetite.


625
00:50:37.751 --> 00:50:39.962
Thank you very much, sir.

626
00:50:43.299 --> 00:50:45.176
I'm a fool.

627
00:50:45.301 --> 00:50:48.805
I don't think you're a fool.
Far from it.


628
00:50:48.929 --> 00:50:52.516
I ought to have known, sir, that you're
Physician Ordinary to the Royal Family.


629
00:50:52.600 --> 00:50:54.519
Well, yes, it's certainly an honor ...

630
00:50:54.602 --> 00:50:57.355
but it's an honor
best owed on many doctors.


631
00:50:57.438 --> 00:51:00.524
Now, about our friend here,
I can tell you this much:


632
00:51:00.608 --> 00:51:04.570
He cut their throats from left to right,
therefore he's right-handed.


633
00:51:04.695 --> 00:51:06.614
Excuse me.

634
00:51:06.697 --> 00:51:10.409
He had to slice through
four layers of tissue ... 


635
00:51:10.493 --> 00:51:12.912
and up to an inch
of subcutaneous fat.


636
00:51:13.037 --> 00:51:14.914
After that ...

637
00:51:15.039 --> 00:51:16.916
he entered the abdominal cavity ...

638
00:51:17.041 --> 00:51:20.294
so he would have had to use more
than just merely the Liston knife.


639
00:51:20.419 --> 00:51:24.506
Perhaps he was carrying a portable
amputation kit similar to this.


640
00:51:26.300 --> 00:51:27.843
What do you think?

641
00:51:35.684 --> 00:51:38.604
Is it possible, sir, that the killer
is an educated man ... 


642
00:51:38.687 --> 00:51:40.564
perhaps someone who studied medicine ...

643
00:51:40.648 --> 00:51:43.651
but who is, in fact,
not a surgeon himself?


644
00:51:44.735 --> 00:51:46.654
The intestines are simple enough.

645
00:51:46.737 --> 00:51:48.989
But, uh, the uterus?

646
00:51:49.114 --> 00:51:52.492
The liver, especially. Hard to locate,
unless you know what you're doing.


647
00:51:52.576 --> 00:51:54.912
And he was working quickly, in the dark.

648
00:51:55.037 --> 00:51:57.498
I had held out
hope that this ...

649
00:51:57.623 --> 00:51:59.542
monster was a veterinarian ...

650
00:51:59.625 --> 00:52:02.378
or a furrier or an ...

651
00:52:02.503 --> 00:52:05.131
especially well-educated butcher.

652
00:52:05.214 --> 00:52:08.801
No, I must admit, if
I were you ...

653
00:52:08.926 --> 00:52:11.971
I'd look for someone with
a thorough knowledge of human anatomy.


654
00:52:14.140 --> 00:52:16.059
Damn him.

655
00:52:44.670 --> 00:52:47.089
Do you want me to suck it?

656
00:52:47.214 --> 00:52:49.591
I can suck the Thames dry.

657
00:52:49.675 --> 00:52:52.094
Don't be frightened, dearie.

[Buckingham Palace]

659
00:53:08.360 --> 00:53:12.072
How far advanced
is our grandson's malady?


660
00:53:14.617 --> 00:53:18.079
Uh, no lesions have appeared, ma'am.

661
00:53:18.204 --> 00:53:21.833
There is some neural damage--
a slight trembling ofthe right hand.


662
00:53:21.957 --> 00:53:24.042
But I'm hopeful--
more than hopeful--


663
00:53:24.126 --> 00:53:26.045
that treatment will arrest the disease.

664
00:53:26.128 --> 00:53:31.050
He seems to us to be suffering
greatly in his mind.


665
00:53:31.133 --> 00:53:33.636
Is the disease affecting his emotions?

666
00:53:33.761 --> 00:53:36.722
Yes, well, of course
his mood is depressed ... 


667
00:53:36.847 --> 00:53:40.726
because ofthe news of the diagnosis.

668
00:53:40.851 --> 00:53:44.938
But that should improve
as he regains his strength.


669
00:53:45.022 --> 00:53:48.067
You are a true physician, Sir William.

670
00:53:48.192 --> 00:53:51.946
In all ways, you attend
to the health of our empire.

- Yes.


678
00:54:26.730 --> 00:54:29.775
This area would form a likely point.

679
00:54:29.859 --> 00:54:32.987
I want double shifts within
these streets until further notice.


680
00:54:33.112 --> 00:54:36.073
And don't only worry
about Jews and butchers.


681
00:54:36.198 --> 00:54:38.367

the Star of David has six points.

have to be killed.

killed your two friends.

- We're watching them.

00:56:51.167 --> 00:56:53.670
Can't arrest them without evidence,
so we watch them.

- What else can we do?
- I'll testify.

If you keep meself
and me friends alive, I'll testify.


718
00:57:00.759 --> 00:57:02.135
To what, precisely?

719
00:57:02.261 --> 00:57:05.264
That McQueen said he'd cut me
unless I pay him a pound a week.


720
00:57:05.347 --> 00:57:07.474
- No.
- What you mean, no?


721
00:57:07.600 --> 00:57:11.646
You asked me to testify.
Are you worried I'll let you down?


722
00:57:11.770 --> 00:57:14.439
I won't.
I promise I won't.


723
00:57:14.565 --> 00:57:17.693
You testify against McQueen,
maybe he goes in for a year or two.

their revenge on you and your friends.

a great big round woman ...

for a husband.

And a dozen plump children, I imagine.

00:57:48.933 --> 00:57:52.854
You think that's funny-- an unfortunate
like me being a decent mother?


732
00:57:52.978 --> 00:57:54.980
No, no, I didn't mean that.
I didn't mean that at all.

someday, Mary.

they would be after her, right?

Didn't say where.
Could be for the night.

and I should wait.

Where are you going, sir?

766
00:59:52.056 --> 00:59:53.933
He said I should wait in his office.

767
00:59:55.267 --> 00:59:57.978
And what floor
is Mr. Kidney's office on?

I don't know what floor,
you bloody idiot ... 


769
01:00:01.565 --> 01:00:03.859
because I haven't been to
his fucking office yet, have I?


770
01:00:03.943 --> 01:00:06.028
He told me to have
the desk man let me up.


771

But I'm more than happy
to stand here like a knob ...

Free Ireland!

781
01:02:07.942 --> 01:02:09.610
Get inside, sir!

782
01:02:20.871 --> 01:02:22.873
Just some gunpowder, sir.
That's all.


783
01:02:22.998 --> 01:02:24.917
Little more than a firework.

784
01:02:26.210 --> 01:02:28.212
Anyone go in or out?

785
01:02:28.295 --> 01:02:31.381
Yes, sir. I'm sorry, sir.
Yes, uh--


786
01:02:31.507 --> 01:02:33.384
There's an inspector Adderly
in your office.


787
01:02:44.311 --> 01:02:46.271
No, there's nothing missing here.

788
01:02:52.027 --> 01:02:55.656
The bastards have been in here, sir.
I can smell 'em.

[MARYLEBONE WORKHOUSE]

790
01:03:16.469 --> 01:03:18.388
- No.
- Yes.


791
01:03:18.471 --> 01:03:21.391
No, not together.
Too suspicious.


792
01:03:21.474 --> 01:03:25.228
You wait for me, and if she's in there
you can go and visit her on your own.


793
01:03:25.311 --> 01:03:27.230
I'm going with you right now ...

794
01:03:27.313 --> 01:03:29.232
or I'm going to the newspapers.

795
01:03:31.108 --> 01:03:32.985
I mean it.

796
01:03:40.326 --> 01:03:43.538
There's a number of mental disorders
for which it is necessary ... 


797
01:03:43.621 --> 01:03:47.333
to remove the front part of the brain.

798
01:03:47.416 --> 01:03:50.419
Her records indicate
that she was violent ... 


799
01:03:50.503 --> 01:03:53.965
threatening to do harm
to herself ... and others.


800
01:03:54.089 --> 01:03:55.966
Does she have any relations?

801
01:03:56.091 --> 01:03:58.218
No, she's a ward of the state.

802
01:03:58.302 --> 01:04:01.138
- That's a lie.
- Listen to me.


803
01:04:01.222 --> 01:04:03.349
You're under arrest.
You're here to assist my investigation.


804
01:04:03.474 --> 01:04:07.061
- Keep your mouth shut. Is that clear?
- Sorry, sir.


805
01:04:07.186 --> 01:04:09.313
Good.

806
01:04:09.438 --> 01:04:11.357
What else do you know about her?

807
01:04:11.440 --> 01:04:14.109
All we know is that
she was an unfortunate ... 


808
01:04:14.235 --> 01:04:17.697
who lived in
the Whitechapel district.


809
01:04:17.822 --> 01:04:20.199
I'd like to ask her
a few questions.


810
01:04:21.867 --> 01:04:23.869
You won't get any sense out of her.

811
01:04:25.287 --> 01:04:27.206
I'm used to that.

812
01:04:39.969 --> 01:04:43.931
Hello, Ann.
I brought Mary Kelly.


813
01:04:44.056 --> 01:04:48.894
- Do you remember Mary Kelly?
- Ann, you know me.


814
01:04:49.019 --> 01:04:52.231
I'm your best friend
in all the world.


815
01:04:52.273 --> 01:04:55.943
Go away. Go away. Go away.

816
01:04:57.361 --> 01:05:00.406
Ann, I'm gonna find Baby Alice.

817
01:05:00.531 --> 01:05:02.950
I'm gonna take care ofher.

818
01:05:03.075 --> 01:05:06.912
Alice is laughing to me.
Laughing to me.


819
01:05:06.996 --> 01:05:10.124
Laughing to me all day long.

820
01:05:10.207 --> 01:05:12.918
It's all right.
It's all right, darling.


821
01:05:13.043 --> 01:05:14.962
What about her father?

822
01:05:16.130 --> 01:05:18.007
Have you seen
Alice's father, Ann?


823
01:05:21.177 --> 01:05:25.556
He's a prince. A prince.

824
01:05:25.639 --> 01:05:29.226
A prince! A prince!
And I'm a queen.


825
01:05:29.268 --> 01:05:31.812
I'm a queen! I'm a queen!

826
01:05:34.273 --> 01:05:37.276
How do you know he was a painter?

827
01:05:37.401 --> 01:05:39.320
He hired us to pose as artist models.

828
01:05:39.445 --> 01:05:43.824
And what exactly does that entail?
"Artist models."


829
01:05:43.949 --> 01:05:47.035
We stood very still
so he could paint us.


830
01:05:47.161 --> 01:05:49.955
What's the matter?
You think I was born a whore?


831
01:05:50.080 --> 01:05:52.332
Oh, I'm sorry.
I'm an unfortunate, not a whore.


832
01:05:52.416 --> 01:05:54.335
England doesn't have whores.

833
01:05:54.418 --> 01:05:58.047
Just a great mass
of very unlucky women.


834
01:05:58.172 --> 01:06:00.758
So, Ann Crook ...

835
01:06:00.841 --> 01:06:03.177
and the painter became lovers--
is that it?


836
01:06:03.260 --> 01:06:07.806
He married her ... in a lovely
Catholic church-- Saint Savior's.


837
01:06:07.890 --> 01:06:10.059
I was a witness,
as a matter off act.


838
01:06:10.142 --> 01:06:12.144
He married her in a Catholic church.

839
01:06:13.604 --> 01:06:15.689
What doyou think
they've done to Baby Alice?


840
01:06:19.735 --> 01:06:22.321
Special Branch
dumped her in Bishops gate?


841
01:06:22.446 --> 01:06:25.157
Yeah, as an unknown.

842
01:06:25.241 --> 01:06:29.162
- But why?
- When I find out, I'll tell you.


843
01:06:29.203 --> 01:06:32.998
- Take me to her. You have to.
- No, not yet.


844
01:06:33.082 --> 01:06:35.042
I need to know more first.

845
01:06:37.211 --> 01:06:40.673
Look here, I promise ...

846
01:06:40.798 --> 01:06:43.259
that I'll help you
with Baby Alice, but not yet.


847
01:06:43.342 --> 01:06:46.470
You gotta trust me on that,
at least a little bit.


848
01:06:48.597 --> 01:06:51.558
I do. I do trust you.

849
01:06:51.642 --> 01:06:54.061
Good.

850
01:06:54.186 --> 01:06:57.231
Do you have little ones, inspector?

851
01:06:57.356 --> 01:07:00.568
No. No.

852
01:07:02.361 --> 01:07:06.198
A year ago--
No, two years--


853
01:07:06.282 --> 01:07:08.993
I'm sorry, more than two years--

854
01:07:09.118 --> 01:07:12.955
my wife, um, passed away ...

855
01:07:13.080 --> 01:07:15.874
giving birth to
what I'm told was a son.


856
01:07:15.958 --> 01:07:18.502
I'm sorry.

857
01:07:18.627 --> 01:07:20.671
Thanks.

858
01:07:25.509 --> 01:07:28.387
I wanna show you some paintings
on the way out, yeah?


859
01:07:28.512 --> 01:07:31.557
-Are you gonna take me into the gallery?
-Why not?


860
01:07:33.017 --> 01:07:34.894
Come on.

861
01:07:57.708 --> 01:08:01.128
- Did you see the look on her face?
- I think she stopped breathing.


862
01:08:05.841 --> 01:08:07.760
She's a fright.

863
01:08:07.843 --> 01:08:10.429
She has cold eyes.

864
01:08:10.554 --> 01:08:14.016
I feel like someone's
walking over my grave.


865
01:08:14.099 --> 01:08:17.019
There's one more painting
I want you to see.


866
01:08:35.120 --> 01:08:37.581
You know him, don't you?

867
01:08:37.665 --> 01:08:41.586
Those whom Godhas
joined together, let no man put a sunder.


868
01:08:41.710 --> 01:08:43.962
I pronounce ...

869
01:08:44.046 --> 01:08:46.423
that theybe man and wife.

870
01:08:46.549 --> 01:08:50.720
In nomine Patris, et Filii,
et Spiritus Sancti. Amen.


871
01:09:01.355 --> 01:09:04.316
- Sir William Gull, please.
- Sir William isn't receiving visitors.


872
01:09:06.527 --> 01:09:08.112
Uh--

873
01:09:08.195 --> 01:09:10.864
Sir William?
It's inspector Abberline.


874
01:09:10.990 --> 01:09:12.950
I need to speak with you, sir.

875
01:09:13.033 --> 01:09:15.702
Sir William is ill.
Can't receive any visitors.


876
01:09:18.455 --> 01:09:20.290
I said ...

877
01:09:20.416 --> 01:09:23.044
you can't go in.

878
01:09:23.169 --> 01:09:26.381
It's allright, Dr. Ferral.
I don't mind company.


879
01:09:26.464 --> 01:09:29.342
Have Anna bring us some tea,
would you, please?


880
01:09:34.680 --> 01:09:38.184
Ah, well, I wish
I could tell you, inspector ... 


881
01:09:38.267 --> 01:09:40.186
that your story was fantastical.

882
01:09:42.396 --> 01:09:45.399
Unhappily, I cannot.

883
01:09:45.524 --> 01:09:50.988
I know for a fact that the prince
has a taste in unfortunate women.


884
01:09:51.113 --> 01:09:53.490
And I suppose it's
more than possible that ... 


885
01:09:53.616 --> 01:09:56.452
he concocted this elaborate deception ...

886
01:09:56.577 --> 01:10:00.331
to have some privacy while
he indulgedin his secret life.


887
01:10:00.456 --> 01:10:03.876
But I know one reason
I have for stating ... 


888
01:10:03.959 --> 01:10:08.714
that Prince Edward being Jack the Ripper
is just incomprehensible.


889
01:10:08.839 --> 01:10:11.050
What's that, sir?

890
01:10:14.220 --> 01:10:18.099
If you repeat what I'm about to tell
you, both our lives are in jeopardy.


891
01:10:18.224 --> 01:10:20.810
Indeed, I hope for your sake
that what I'm about to say ... 


892
01:10:20.935 --> 01:10:23.771
will steer you clear of
the very real danger you're in.


893
01:10:23.896 --> 01:10:26.816
I think I'm well past the point
of safe return, sir.


894
01:10:29.109 --> 01:10:30.986
Prince Edward has syphilis.

895
01:10:33.614 --> 01:10:37.118
Not a pleasant state secret,
but a vital one.


896
01:10:37.201 --> 01:10:39.120
Well, then that proves it.

897
01:10:39.203 --> 01:10:43.457
I couldn't understand why the prince
was killing Ann Crook's friends ... 


898
01:10:43.582 --> 01:10:46.168
especially so savagely, but ...

899
01:10:46.293 --> 01:10:48.253
he's not merely killing them.

900
01:10:49.505 --> 01:10:51.382
He's punishing them.

901
01:10:51.507 --> 01:10:53.843
He wants revenge.
Don't you see, sir?


902
01:10:53.968 --> 01:10:57.346
No, inspector, I don't see.

903
01:10:57.429 --> 01:11:00.933
I'm afraid your wild speculations
about the prince's mental state ... 


904
01:11:01.058 --> 01:11:03.561
clever though they maybe ...

905
01:11:03.686 --> 01:11:05.605
cannot overcome
the physical impossibility ... 


906
01:11:05.688 --> 01:11:07.607
of his committing these crimes.

907
01:11:07.731 --> 01:11:10.317
The disease is
far enough along that ... 


908
01:11:10.442 --> 01:11:13.195
the prince's hands
tremble uncontrollably.


909
01:11:13.320 --> 01:11:15.948
He's very weak,
and the killings of Jack the Ripper ... 


910
01:11:16.073 --> 01:11:19.660
require sure hands
and considerable vigor.


911
01:11:21.120 --> 01:11:23.623
And have you forgotten
the most telling fact?


912
01:11:24.957 --> 01:11:26.876
Whatever else the prince may be ...

913
01:11:26.959 --> 01:11:29.753
he knows little or nothing
of human anatomy.


914
01:12:07.041 --> 01:12:11.462
Conduct the candidate to the center
ofthe lodge and cause him to kneel ... 


915
01:12:11.587 --> 01:12:13.547
for the benefit of prayer.

916
01:12:19.428 --> 01:12:22.848
Vouch safe thine aid,
Almighty Father of the universe ... 


917
01:12:22.973 --> 01:12:25.058
to this, our present convention.

918
01:12:26.852 --> 01:12:29.688
Who is this?

919
01:12:29.772 --> 01:12:32.316
A poor candidate
in a state of darkness ... 


920
01:12:32.441 --> 01:12:35.361
who comes of his
own free will ...

921
01:12:35.444 --> 01:12:38.530
perfectly prepared,
humbly soliciting ... 


922
01:12:38.656 --> 01:12:43.202
to be admitted into
the my steries and privileges.


923
01:12:43.285 --> 01:12:46.538
In all cases of
danger and distress ...

924
01:12:46.664 --> 01:12:49.041
in whom do you put your trust?

925
01:12:49.124 --> 01:12:50.876
In God.

926
01:12:50.960 --> 01:12:54.755
How did he find out about
the unfortunate and her child?


927
01:12:54.880 --> 01:12:57.216
Well, he has
that kind of cleverness ... 


928
01:12:57.341 --> 01:13:00.135
you'll sometimes find
in the middle classes.


929
01:13:00.219 --> 01:13:03.389
A cheap sort of intelligence,
but effective nevertheless.


930
01:13:04.932 --> 01:13:08.602
Hmm. Thank God that's not
something you're burdened by.


931
01:13:08.727 --> 01:13:10.604
Yes, thank God.

932
01:13:10.729 --> 01:13:13.398
Recite the solemn oath.

933
01:13:13.524 --> 01:13:15.568
Never to reveal our secrets ...

934
01:13:15.693 --> 01:13:18.196
under no less a penalty than ...

935
01:13:18.279 --> 01:13:20.865
my throat be cut across ...

936
01:13:20.990 --> 01:13:23.826
my tongue be torn out
by its root ...

937
01:13:23.909 --> 01:13:26.912
and that I be
buried in sand ...

938
01:13:27.037 --> 01:13:28.914
a cable's length from shore.

939
01:13:30.749 --> 01:13:33.335
You don't think Gull
is confiding in him, do you?


940
01:13:33.460 --> 01:13:36.088
The old fellow isn't as far gone
as all that, is he?


941
01:13:37.214 --> 01:13:40.259
No. He's not that foolish.

942
01:13:44.763 --> 01:13:47.474
Let the brother receive the light.

943
01:14:03.032 --> 01:14:07.745
'Another beautiful
murder will be committed by me."


944
01:14:07.870 --> 01:14:10.247
"Fear me.Jack the Ripper."

945
01:14:10.372 --> 01:14:13.667
- They're rubbish, you know that.
- Yes, I agree. They're rubbish.


946
01:14:13.792 --> 01:14:17.713
Though why you persist in believing that
red-haired jezebel, I'll never know.


947
01:14:17.838 --> 01:14:21.008
Have you considered that she's the sort
of woman who likes to make up stories ... 


948
01:14:21.133 --> 01:14:23.010
particularly about men?

949
01:14:23.135 --> 01:14:25.137
She is, after all, a whore.
She's a woman who--


950
01:14:28.557 --> 01:14:32.352
"A rose by any other name."
Is that it?


951
01:14:34.355 --> 01:14:37.650
Frederick, my dear chum, no one
is more delighted than I am ... 


952
01:14:37.733 --> 01:14:40.736
that you've decided to resume
your interest in the fairer sex ... 


953
01:14:40.820 --> 01:14:42.780
but please remember ...

954
01:14:42.905 --> 01:14:45.741
a woman like that can make a man feel
whatever she wants him to feel.


955
01:14:45.825 --> 01:14:48.036
- Sergeant Godley.
- Yes, sir.


956
01:14:48.160 --> 01:14:49.745
Arrest the Nichol Street gang.

957
01:14:49.829 --> 01:14:52.206
- Right away, inspector.
- I tried to stop them, inspector.


958
01:14:52.248 --> 01:14:54.709
This arrived with this afternoon's post.

959
01:14:54.834 --> 01:14:56.753
Open it up!

960
01:14:56.877 --> 01:15:00.506
"I send you half the kidney I took
from one woman, preserved for you.


961
01:15:00.631 --> 01:15:04.593
T'other piece I fried and ate.
It was very nice."


962
01:15:04.677 --> 01:15:07.638
We demand something be done,
and done tonight.


963
01:15:07.721 --> 01:15:10.557
"From Hell."

964
01:15:10.683 --> 01:15:13.394
Well, at least
they got the address right.


965
01:15:13.519 --> 01:15:16.689
It can't be.
Are you sure he was the same?


966
01:15:16.772 --> 01:15:19.608
I know him.
I posed for him twice meself.


967
01:15:19.733 --> 01:15:22.819
I stood there naked as a babe
watching him paint me for hours.


968
01:15:22.945 --> 01:15:25.197
And he was with Ann for what--
over a year?


969
01:15:25.281 --> 01:15:28.242
- Nearly two.

970
01:15:30.202 --> 01:15:32.913
Ah, here you are.
Hello, girls.


971
01:15:33.038 --> 01:15:35.415
Where have you been?
I told you to wait for me.


972
01:15:35.499 --> 01:15:38.711
I can't stay in a pub
and not have a drink.


973
01:15:38.836 --> 01:15:41.672
That's cruel.
But look who I bumped into.


974
01:15:41.755 --> 01:15:43.840
Remember Ada?

975
01:15:45.176 --> 01:15:47.845
- She's from France.
- Bruxelles.


976
01:15:49.889 --> 01:15:52.141
- Bruxelles.
- Yes.


977
01:15:52.183 --> 01:15:54.185
Oh, she is pretty, isn't she?

978
01:15:55.853 --> 01:15:59.440
Not in public, love.
Not in public.


979
01:15:59.565 --> 01:16:02.943
Would you give us a minute alone?
We need to speak with Liz.


980
01:16:03.027 --> 01:16:06.489
No, Ada, you stay where you are.

981
01:16:06.614 --> 01:16:08.574
Come, Mary.
Get a drinksy.


982
01:16:08.657 --> 01:16:11.910
- Mary.

983
01:16:20.002 --> 01:16:22.880
You don't have to worry
about Nichol Street for at least a week.


984
01:16:22.963 --> 01:16:25.841
- I can keep 'em that long.
- Well, that's something, anyway.


985
01:16:25.966 --> 01:16:28.385
- Thank you.
- Yeah.


986
01:16:28.511 --> 01:16:32.056
- Baby Alice, she's all right?
- Yeah, she's all right.


987
01:16:32.181 --> 01:16:34.058
We'll get her out after this is over.

988
01:16:34.183 --> 01:16:36.143
"We'll get her."

989
01:16:36.185 --> 01:16:38.145
Listen.

990
01:16:38.229 --> 01:16:41.065
I want you and your friends off the
streets until I can sort this thing out.


991
01:16:41.190 --> 01:16:43.901
- Off the streets? For how long?
- A few days, at least.


992
01:16:44.026 --> 01:16:45.903
Well, you better
throw us in jail then ... 


993
01:16:46.028 --> 01:16:48.656
'cause we have no money for food
and no money for a doss.


994
01:16:48.781 --> 01:16:51.575
All right. You take this.

995
01:16:51.700 --> 01:16:54.411
Buy some food,
get a room and stay there.


996
01:16:54.537 --> 01:16:58.291
Don't tell anyone where you're going.
I don't want to know.


997
01:16:58.374 --> 01:17:01.586
In three days, come to the Ten Bells.

998
01:17:01.710 --> 01:17:03.962
I'll leave a message
with the barkeep.


999
01:17:07.174 --> 01:17:10.427
What? It's not enough?

1000
01:17:10.553 --> 01:17:15.016
I wish I could show you
the little village where I was born.


1001
01:17:15.099 --> 01:17:17.351
It's so lovely there.

1002
01:17:17.476 --> 01:17:21.146
It's by the sea,
the way you said you saw me.


1003
01:17:21.230 --> 01:17:24.400
I used to think it too small
to spend a life in ... 


1004
01:17:24.525 --> 01:17:27.028
but now I'm not so sure.

1005
01:17:32.783 --> 01:17:35.035
Don't. Don't.

1006
01:17:35.161 --> 01:17:38.706
What? Do you think
I'm paying you back?


1007
01:17:38.831 --> 01:17:41.250
I didn't mean it as business.

1008
01:17:41.375 --> 01:17:43.961
I'm still a woman.
They haven't taken that away from me.


1009
01:17:44.044 --> 01:17:45.963
Not yet, anyways.

1010
01:17:58.642 --> 01:18:00.519
- Enough of that.

1011
01:18:02.021 --> 01:18:04.482
Now, lad, at least take--

1012
01:18:06.650 --> 01:18:08.569
Sorry, sir.

1013
01:18:27.671 --> 01:18:32.050
There, milady.
One more time.


1014
01:18:34.512 --> 01:18:36.431
And curtsy.

1015
01:18:38.307 --> 01:18:40.267
And we're done.

1016
01:18:49.860 --> 01:18:53.405
Oh, don't be modest, girl.
They don't care what we do.


1017
01:19:01.664 --> 01:19:04.208
I paid for your supper, remember.

1018
01:19:04.333 --> 01:19:07.086
Stop shaking your head at me,
you slag!


1019
01:19:07.169 --> 01:19:09.088
Leave her alone.

1020
01:19:09.171 --> 01:19:11.173
She is my business.
She's not yours.


1021
01:19:11.298 --> 01:19:13.175
Liz, just be quiet for one bloody night.

1022
01:19:13.300 --> 01:19:15.302
No, I fucking won't keep my voice down!

1023
01:19:15.427 --> 01:19:17.346
Calm down!
They'll call the land lord on us.


1024
01:19:17.429 --> 01:19:19.389
Don't go out.
It's not safe.


1025
01:19:19.515 --> 01:19:22.393
I need something to sustain myself.

1026
01:19:22.476 --> 01:19:24.728
- I will be right back.
- Liz, don't be so fucking stupid!


1027
01:19:24.854 --> 01:19:27.231
- Do without for a night.
- No.


1028
01:19:27.314 --> 01:19:29.775
- I want a fucking drink.
- Liz!


1029
01:19:33.028 --> 01:19:35.697
Here we are.
Service records.


1030
01:19:35.823 --> 01:19:39.368
Grenadier Guards.
Lieutenant Benjamin Kidney.


1031
01:19:41.120 --> 01:19:44.373
There, just as you suspected.

1032
01:19:45.875 --> 01:19:47.794
Before he joined Special Branch ...

1033
01:19:47.918 --> 01:19:50.212
Ben Kidney served
in the Grenadier Guards.


1034
01:19:50.337 --> 01:19:54.049
Part of his duties included
assisting the field surgeon.


1035
01:19:54.175 --> 01:19:56.844
Let me tell you something, inspector,
of which I'm absolutely certain.


1036
01:19:56.969 --> 01:20:01.015
Assisting an expert is different--
very, very different--


1037
01:20:01.140 --> 01:20:03.059
from doing it oneself.

1038
01:20:03.142 --> 01:20:05.853
Think about it. Someone's
gotta clean up after the prince.


1039
01:20:05.978 --> 01:20:09.148
And whose job is it
to take care of the widow's messes?


1040
01:20:09.231 --> 01:20:11.483
You've turned into Othello.
Do you know that?


1041
01:20:11.609 --> 01:20:13.694
Everything is a suspicion.

1042
01:20:13.777 --> 01:20:15.195
And like that tragic Moor ...

1043
01:20:15.279 --> 01:20:17.573
all your suspicions
will end up in your own demise.


1044
01:20:17.698 --> 01:20:20.826
For heaven's sake, man,
these women aren't just being silenced.


1045
01:20:20.951 --> 01:20:24.580
They're being murdered most brutally.
Why would Ben Kidney do that?


1046
01:20:24.705 --> 01:20:27.833
To scare people.
To keep their mind off the real point.


1047
01:20:27.958 --> 01:20:29.168
Which is?

1048
01:20:29.210 --> 01:20:31.462
Think what's at stake
for Special Branch.


1049
01:20:31.587 --> 01:20:35.049
Prince Edward married Ann Crook,
a commoner and a Catholic.


1050
01:20:35.174 --> 01:20:37.843
Married her in a Catholic church.
They had a baby.


1051
01:20:37.927 --> 01:20:42.306
A legitimate baby, who is, in fact,
heir to the throne of England.


1052
01:20:42.431 --> 01:20:44.683
All these women were there.

1053
01:20:44.809 --> 01:20:48.980
All these women
were eyewitnesses to an event ... 


1054
01:20:49.104 --> 01:20:51.565
that could rip the empire to pieces.

1055
01:20:58.823 --> 01:21:02.160
When she starts drinking,
she'll go all night. You know that.


1056
01:21:02.284 --> 01:21:04.328
But she knows how dangerous it is.

1057
01:21:04.453 --> 01:21:06.580
She don't believe you
about the prince.


1058
01:21:06.705 --> 01:21:11.376
She thinks you're feeding that copper
candies to keep him interested.


1059
01:21:17.633 --> 01:21:19.802
Hello, sir.

1060
01:21:19.927 --> 01:21:22.638
Is anything wrong, my dear?

1061
01:21:22.721 --> 01:21:27.017
No, sir. For a moment,
I thought you were someone else.


1062
01:21:27.143 --> 01:21:29.771
Oh.

1063
01:21:29.895 --> 01:21:31.772
Thirsty?

1064
01:21:38.904 --> 01:21:42.032
Always parched, sir.

1065
01:21:42.158 --> 01:21:45.244
Perhaps there is somewhere nearby
that we might go ... 


1066
01:21:45.369 --> 01:21:49.039
while my coach man keeps watch.

1067
01:21:49.123 --> 01:21:51.917
Oh, yeah.

1068
01:21:52.042 --> 01:21:55.045
Yeah. This way.

1069
01:21:55.129 --> 01:21:57.048
Follow me.

1070
01:22:25.284 --> 01:22:28.954
Yeah, it's this way.
Follow me.


1071
01:22:32.166 --> 01:22:35.169
I dropped my grapes.

1072
01:22:35.211 --> 01:22:37.296
Oh!

1073
01:22:48.265 --> 01:22:50.517
No!

1074
01:22:55.564 --> 01:22:57.649
What the fuck
are you looking at, Lipski?


1075
01:23:01.946 --> 01:23:04.615
Shut up! Shut up!

1076
01:23:28.013 --> 01:23:30.432
- I hear someone coming, sir.

1077
01:23:30.516 --> 01:23:32.435
- Sir!

1078
01:23:55.040 --> 01:23:56.959
All right, George, that's enough.

1079
01:23:58.085 --> 01:24:00.713
It's one of them, isn't it?

1080
01:24:00.838 --> 01:24:03.049
Throat's cut the same way.

1081
01:24:03.132 --> 01:24:05.384
Yeah.

1082
01:24:05.468 --> 01:24:07.887
He didn't finish.

1083
01:24:08.012 --> 01:24:10.389
Well, she's no less dead for that.

1084
01:24:11.974 --> 01:24:14.143
He won't be satisfied by this.

1085
01:24:18.522 --> 01:24:20.357
Wilkins?

1086
01:24:21.942 --> 01:24:25.446
Fetch the ambulance.
Go on, run along.


1087
01:25:08.697 --> 01:25:10.741
Excuse me, miss.

1088
01:25:51.907 --> 01:25:55.786
You could be dead ... right now.

1089
01:25:55.911 --> 01:25:59.331
But then there wouldbe
too many bloody questions.


1090
01:26:02.293 --> 01:26:05.963
Ignore the old man's blathering.
Find a scape goat.


1091
01:26:06.088 --> 01:26:09.133
Or next time we won't
care who asks ...

1092
01:26:09.216 --> 01:26:12.177
"Whatever happened
to inspector Abberline?"


1093
01:26:38.787 --> 01:26:41.373
We should hurry up, sir.
It's clearin' up.


1094
01:26:43.375 --> 01:26:46.712
Do you have a piece of chalk, Netley?

1095
01:26:46.837 --> 01:26:48.714
Chalk, sir?

1096
01:26:48.839 --> 01:26:51.800
-They found another one in Mitre Square!

1097
01:27:03.604 --> 01:27:06.273
Bastards! They did another one!

1098
01:27:13.113 --> 01:27:15.032
I heard he cut
off her nose this time.

1099
01:27:17.117 --> 01:27:20.621
Nice work, inspector. You've
encouraged him to do two a night now.


1100
01:27:20.746 --> 01:27:22.665
Out ofthe fucking way, cunt.

1101
01:27:31.298 --> 01:27:34.009
Katherine Eddowes.

1102
01:27:34.135 --> 01:27:36.512
There's some writing on a wall
just down the road there.


1103
01:27:36.595 --> 01:27:38.514
You should have a look at it.

1104
01:27:40.099 --> 01:27:44.437
"The 'Juwes'are the men
that will not be blamed for nothing."


1105
01:27:44.562 --> 01:27:46.814
It's hardly Shakespeare, but it'll do.

1106
01:27:49.984 --> 01:27:51.903
I was busy with the children--

1107
01:27:52.027 --> 01:27:54.821
Madame, slow down. Slow down.

1108
01:27:54.947 --> 01:27:57.825
Make sure you get
the apron as well, yeah?


1109
01:28:08.127 --> 01:28:10.504
It was written by the killer, sir.

1110
01:28:10.629 --> 01:28:12.923
And how do you know that?

1111
01:28:13.048 --> 01:28:15.467
I was here three-quarters
of an hour ago.


1112
01:28:17.178 --> 01:28:19.681
This building-- mostly Jews
live here, is that right?


1113
01:28:19.763 --> 01:28:22.557
- Yeah, that's right.
- Ready now, sir.


1114
01:28:22.641 --> 01:28:24.726
Put that away and get out of here
immediately.


1115
01:28:27.354 --> 01:28:29.231
- Abberline.
- Yeah?


1116
01:28:29.356 --> 01:28:30.732
Wash that off.

1117
01:28:30.858 --> 01:28:32.568
- What?
- You heard me.


1118
01:28:32.651 --> 01:28:35.362
- It's evidence, sir.
- Listen to me.


1119
01:28:35.446 --> 01:28:39.909
In another hour, there will be
a thousand people poking about in here.


1120
01:28:39.992 --> 01:28:43.579
If those words are seen,
not a Jew in London will be safe.


1121
01:28:43.704 --> 01:28:47.124
We'll have may hem on the streets.
So wash it off!.


1122
01:28:47.208 --> 01:28:51.796
That's an educated hand, sir.
An educated man wrote that.


1123
01:28:51.921 --> 01:28:54.340
- Look for yourself.
- I don't have to look. I've seen it.


1124
01:28:55.549 --> 01:28:59.136
An educated man
knows how to spell "Jews."


1125
01:28:59.220 --> 01:29:01.514
I don't know what this refers to,
but I'm sure it's got nothing to do ... 


1126
01:29:01.597 --> 01:29:03.516
with the people who live around here.

1127
01:29:07.311 --> 01:29:11.649
Sergeant, I want two constables
to wash that off.


1128
01:29:11.732 --> 01:29:16.403
What are you looking to him for?
Wash it off!.


1129
01:29:16.487 --> 01:29:18.280
Yes, sir.

1130
01:29:20.157 --> 01:29:22.951
Half a dozen men have seen it already.
The sergeant has copied it down.


1131
01:29:23.077 --> 01:29:26.080
I'll remember these words
for as long as I live.


1132
01:29:26.163 --> 01:29:29.792
So all you're doing
is destroying its value as evidence.


1133
01:29:29.917 --> 01:29:32.711
No, all I'm doing is taking
charge of an investigation ... 


1134
01:29:32.837 --> 01:29:36.132
that you have bungled
to the point of gross inefficiency ... 


1135
01:29:36.215 --> 01:29:38.342
and I've had enough.

1136
01:29:38.467 --> 01:29:41.053
You are suspended from duty, Abberline.

1137
01:29:42.346 --> 01:29:45.224
Inspector Abberline is suspended.

1138
01:29:46.517 --> 01:29:50.062
- All his privileges are cancelled.
- Yes, sir.


1139
01:30:05.369 --> 01:30:08.205
You've not seen her, then?

1140
01:30:08.330 --> 01:30:10.958
Well, if she comes around,
give her this.


1141
01:30:13.294 --> 01:30:15.254
Long letter, eh?

1142
01:30:16.881 --> 01:30:18.800
This is for your trouble.

1143
01:30:19.967 --> 01:30:22.511
The letter's private.
You understand?


1144
01:30:22.636 --> 01:30:25.514
- I understand.
- Right.


1145
01:31:15.189 --> 01:31:18.109
Where's this?

1146
01:31:21.862 --> 01:31:24.114
Recite the solemn oath.

1147
01:31:24.198 --> 01:31:27.910
Never to reveal our secrets--

1148
01:31:46.095 --> 01:31:48.014
Grapes again.

1149
01:31:49.473 --> 01:31:51.558
Why grapes?

1150
01:31:51.642 --> 01:31:53.561
This ain't killing for profit.

1151
01:31:53.644 --> 01:31:55.813
-He's not that foolish.
-You oughta be botherin' McQueen.


1152
01:31:55.938 --> 01:31:58.566
-Are you questioning my decision?
-Find a scape goat.


1153
01:32:01.944 --> 01:32:04.071
This is ritual.

1154
01:33:12.890 --> 01:33:17.103
"Jubela, Jubelo, Jubelum."

1155
01:33:19.104 --> 01:33:20.981
"Juwes."

1156
01:33:51.470 --> 01:33:54.181
- It's me, Ada. Me. Only me.

1157
01:33:55.307 --> 01:33:57.726
I bring everything for supper.

1158
01:34:00.437 --> 01:34:03.357
You little thief.
I need this money.


1159
01:34:03.440 --> 01:34:06.526
I just take some money
and buy food for me and for you.


1160
01:34:06.652 --> 01:34:09.530
Is that bad, Marie?

1161
01:34:09.655 --> 01:34:12.616
It's fine, dear.
You're a good person, but listen.


1162
01:34:12.741 --> 01:34:16.620
Until I go away from London,
it's not safe for you to go out.


1163
01:34:16.704 --> 01:34:19.457
Understand?

1164
01:34:19.582 --> 01:34:23.252
I stay with Marie.
Beautiful Marie.


1165
01:34:23.377 --> 01:34:26.922
It's all right, darling.
You don't have to pay for your food.


1166
01:34:27.047 --> 01:34:28.966
Pardon?

1167
01:34:31.969 --> 01:34:33.929
Here's to our feast.

1168
01:35:08.589 --> 01:35:12.551
I'm so sorry to greet you
like this, inspector, but--


1169
01:35:12.676 --> 01:35:14.595
but I'm rather late
for an appointment.


1170
01:35:14.678 --> 01:35:16.805
Will you excuse me
if I finish dressing while we talk?


1171
01:35:16.889 --> 01:35:18.808
No, no. Please, go on.

1172
01:35:18.891 --> 01:35:20.476
Thank you.

1173
01:35:22.186 --> 01:35:25.981
I'd like to speak to you about
the Freemasons if I might, sir.


1174
01:35:27.733 --> 01:35:32.404
The arrangement of the coins
at Dark Annie's feet ... 


1175
01:35:32.530 --> 01:35:36.117
and also the locations
of the bodies ...

1176
01:35:37.284 --> 01:35:39.161
form apentacle star.

1177
01:35:39.286 --> 01:35:42.331
A pentacle star is a symbol
of the Freemasons, is it not, sir?


1178
01:35:42.456 --> 01:35:44.375
Yes.

1179
01:35:46.335 --> 01:35:50.798
And the way that all these women were
killed-- throats cut left to right ... 


1180
01:35:52.258 --> 01:35:54.135
organs removed.

1181
01:35:56.095 --> 01:35:58.055
They're reenactments,
aren't they, sir?


1182
01:36:01.308 --> 01:36:03.185
Reenactments of what?

1183
01:36:03.310 --> 01:36:06.522
The Juwes.

1184
01:36:06.605 --> 01:36:09.108
The traitors who killed Hiram Abiff,
founder of the Masons--


1185
01:36:09.233 --> 01:36:11.944
that's how they were executed.

1186
01:36:12.027 --> 01:36:16.031
Ah, yes.
So the great book tells us.


1187
01:36:16.115 --> 01:36:20.328
So Jack the Ripper
isn't just merely killing whores.


1188
01:36:21.704 --> 01:36:23.581
He's executing traitors.

1189
01:36:23.706 --> 01:36:26.876
He's a Mason fulfilling a duty.

1190
01:36:27.001 --> 01:36:29.462
Yes, I'm afraid, inspector ...

1191
01:36:29.587 --> 01:36:31.589
that you won't be permitted
to arrest him.


1192
01:36:31.714 --> 01:36:34.467
I don't want to arrest him.

1193
01:36:37.511 --> 01:36:40.305
The Ripper has
one more traitor yet to kill ... 


1194
01:36:40.431 --> 01:36:43.225
and I will stop him.

1195
01:36:48.105 --> 01:36:50.566
Did they come to you, sir ...

1196
01:36:50.691 --> 01:36:52.735
as a loyal Mason?

1197
01:36:54.528 --> 01:36:57.906
Did they ask you to help them cover up
the prince's secret marriage?


1198
01:37:01.702 --> 01:37:03.913
That's how it started, yes.

1199
01:37:04.038 --> 01:37:07.667
And then you discovered
the prince had syphilis.


1200
01:37:08.876 --> 01:37:11.170
He's going to die of it, inspector.

1201
01:37:13.297 --> 01:37:16.091
Would you like a tour
of the syphilis wards?


1202
01:37:19.303 --> 01:37:22.306
You're a physician ordinary
to the queen ... 


1203
01:37:24.266 --> 01:37:28.061
entrusted with the well-being
of the heir to the throne.


1204
01:37:28.145 --> 01:37:30.814
Only you ...

1205
01:37:30.940 --> 01:37:34.318
had reason to believe
that these unfortunates ... 


1206
01:37:34.443 --> 01:37:36.654
these whores ...

1207
01:37:36.779 --> 01:37:39.240
these ... traitors ...

1208
01:37:40.866 --> 01:37:42.826
destroyed your life's work.

1209
01:37:51.794 --> 01:37:55.256
Below the skin of history ...

1210
01:37:55.339 --> 01:37:57.299
are London's veins.

1211
01:37:57.383 --> 01:38:02.972
These symbols--
the mitre, the pentacle star--


1212
01:38:03.055 --> 01:38:05.558
even someone as ignorant ...

1213
01:38:05.641 --> 01:38:09.228
and degenerate as you ...

1214
01:38:09.353 --> 01:38:13.649
can sense that they course
with energy and meaning.


1215
01:38:17.278 --> 01:38:20.531
I am that meaning.

1216
01:38:20.656 --> 01:38:23.617
I am that energy.

1217
01:38:31.792 --> 01:38:34.253
One day, men will look back ...

1218
01:38:36.255 --> 01:38:39.467
and say I gave birth
to the 20th century.


1219
01:38:46.557 --> 01:38:49.060
You're not going to see
the 20th century.


1220
01:39:30.309 --> 01:39:33.312
Roll up his sleeve.

1221
01:39:36.106 --> 01:39:38.942
- Don't struggle.

1222
01:39:40.653 --> 01:39:42.572
You'll only make this more painful.

1223
01:41:05.613 --> 01:41:08.116
You all right, mate?

1224
01:43:10.446 --> 01:43:13.240
-Dr. Gull.
-Yes!


1225
01:43:13.365 --> 01:43:15.826
You were describing
the human heart.


1226
01:43:17.536 --> 01:43:19.455
Yes.

1227
01:43:20.956 --> 01:43:23.667
Yes.

1228
01:43:23.751 --> 01:43:26.295
The human heart ...

1229
01:43:26.420 --> 01:43:29.089
is a dense and powerful muscle ...

1230
01:43:30.591 --> 01:43:33.761
much like the organic
equivalent of mahogany.


1231
01:43:34.845 --> 01:43:38.349
And notoriously difficult ...

1232
01:43:38.474 --> 01:43:40.309
to burn.

1233
01:43:43.521 --> 01:43:45.440
About the size of a fist ...

1234
01:43:47.066 --> 01:43:49.652
it provides the motor power
for the circulatory system.


1235
01:43:52.196 --> 01:43:56.033
The heart contains two atria,
two ventricles ... 


1236
01:43:56.116 --> 01:43:58.035
and fourvalves.

1237
01:43:59.203 --> 01:44:03.165
It is, in eff.ect, asingle pump ...

1238
01:44:03.249 --> 01:44:05.460
powering a double circuit.

1239
01:44:08.087 --> 01:44:12.508
In the adult the heart rate
averages 70 to 80 beats a minute.


1240
01:44:15.678 --> 01:44:19.265
Such is the force
of the heartbeat ... 


1241
01:44:19.348 --> 01:44:23.978
that if the body's largest artery,
the aorta, is severed ... 


1242
01:44:26.063 --> 01:44:30.442
-a six-footjet of blood ...

1243
01:44:30.526 --> 01:44:32.903
is released.

1244
01:45:06.770 --> 01:45:09.815
Let the brother receive the light.

1245
01:45:13.360 --> 01:45:18.240
For you fear no God, arise.

1246
01:45:19.450 --> 01:45:21.619
Your faith is well founded.

1247
01:46:01.575 --> 01:46:04.244
Don't. Don't go in there.
There's no need.


1248
01:46:04.328 --> 01:46:07.164
How bad is it?

1249
01:46:07.289 --> 01:46:10.334
She's
-She's in pieces, sir.

1250
01:46:10.459 --> 01:46:12.336
Sergeant, he can go in.

1251
01:46:25.182 --> 01:46:28.102
- Give him to me!
- He'll be taken care of, I swear to it.


1252
01:46:28.227 --> 01:46:31.605
- I want him.
- He's done. I give you my word.


1253
01:46:31.689 --> 01:46:35.943
Fuck your word! I'll bring every
last one of you fucking cunts down.


1254
01:46:36.068 --> 01:46:37.945
You and your fucking brothers!

1255
01:46:38.070 --> 01:46:39.863
Now, listen to me, Abberline.

1256
01:46:39.947 --> 01:46:42.324
Your situation--
your difficult situation--


1257
01:46:42.408 --> 01:46:44.327
has been thoroughly discussed.

1258
01:46:44.410 --> 01:46:48.497
You are reinstated.
Indeed, you are promoted.


1259
01:46:50.416 --> 01:46:52.460
- No! No.

1260
01:46:52.585 --> 01:46:55.421
Come on. This is not helping anything.
Come on! Come on.


1261
01:46:55.546 --> 01:46:59.050
Don't be a fool, inspector.

1262
01:46:59.133 --> 01:47:03.054
You will be very closely watched.

1263
01:47:03.137 --> 01:47:05.056
Yeah, you're all there now, ain'tya?

1264
01:47:05.139 --> 01:47:07.058
Where were you
when this was happening?


1265
01:47:07.183 --> 01:47:10.269
It's all right for you, standing
around there chatting. What about us?


1266
01:47:10.394 --> 01:47:13.522
Inspector Abberline is in charge.

1267
01:47:13.647 --> 01:47:16.692
Give him all the assistance
he requires.


1268
01:47:23.157 --> 01:47:25.076
No!

1269
01:47:25.159 --> 01:47:27.995
Remember, you're being watched.

1270
01:47:28.078 --> 01:47:30.706
All right, come on, you men.
Clear this passage.


1271
01:47:30.831 --> 01:47:33.667
- Come on. Move 'em away.
- Move back! Back!


1272
01:47:41.425 --> 01:47:43.344
Shall we proceed, inspector?

1273
01:48:03.239 --> 01:48:06.033
Body lies in middle of bed.

1274
01:48:06.075 --> 01:48:11.205
Shoulders flat,
but axis of body inclined toward right.


1275
01:48:11.330 --> 01:48:13.415
The left arm is close
to the body ...

1276
01:48:13.499 --> 01:48:15.418
the forearm flexed at
a right angle ...

1277
01:48:15.501 --> 01:48:18.212
resting across the abdomen.

1278
01:48:18.337 --> 01:48:23.008
The right arm
is slightly abducted from the body.


1279
01:48:23.092 --> 01:48:25.720
It rests on the mattress
with the elbow bent ... 


1280
01:48:25.845 --> 01:48:27.764
and the forearm supine.

1281
01:48:29.849 --> 01:48:34.270
The fingers are clenched,
indicating as truggle as she died.


1282
01:48:34.395 --> 01:48:36.689
Notice something, inspector?

1283
01:48:37.940 --> 01:48:40.651
No.

1284
01:48:40.776 --> 01:48:43.654
No, go on.

1285
01:48:47.700 --> 01:48:49.619
Came in not long before dawn.

1286
01:48:49.702 --> 01:48:52.246
A bit of a rush.
Left this for ya.


1287
01:49:00.337 --> 01:49:02.464
I know you asked me to wait.

1288
01:49:02.548 --> 01:49:07.386
If I'm to be murdered,
I'd like at least to die in my village.


1289
01:49:07.511 --> 01:49:10.347
I'm going to the orphanage
to collect Baby Alice.


1290
01:49:10.473 --> 01:49:13.059
Here's an address where you can find us.

1291
01:49:13.184 --> 01:49:15.061
We'll wait for you eagerly.

1292
01:49:15.186 --> 01:49:17.605
I know-
- I knowi n my heart ...

1293
01:49:17.730 --> 01:49:20.191
we can be happy living
by the sea ...

1294
01:49:20.274 --> 01:49:22.902
just as you saw.

1295
01:49:23.027 --> 01:49:25.696
I hope to be with you soon, dearest.

1296
01:49:25.821 --> 01:49:28.032
All my love, Mary.

1297
01:49:40.169 --> 01:49:43.422
We are deeply distressed, 
Lord Hallsham.

1298
01:49:43.547 --> 01:49:48.635
We asked Sir William to remove a threat
to our family and to our throne ... 


1299
01:49:48.761 --> 01:49:52.223
not to engage
in these ghastly rituals.


1300
01:49:52.348 --> 01:49:56.644
Oh, no, of course not, Your Majesty.
That was unexpected.


1301
01:49:56.727 --> 01:49:59.605
On the other hand,
he has fulfilled his duties.


1302
01:49:59.688 --> 01:50:02.149
The threat is passed, Your Majesty.

1303
01:50:02.274 --> 01:50:06.111
In his way Sir William
has been loyal ...

1304
01:50:06.237 --> 01:50:08.823
and we are grateful for that.

1305
01:50:08.948 --> 01:50:11.492
The rest is in your hands,
Lord Hallsham.


1306
01:50:11.617 --> 01:50:15.162
We wish to hear nothing further of this.

1307
01:50:16.288 --> 01:50:18.582
Knight of the East ...

1308
01:50:18.707 --> 01:50:21.084
we are gathered here
beneath the God of love ... 


1309
01:50:21.168 --> 01:50:25.214
and before the sight of
the Great Architect to judge this case.


1310
01:50:25.339 --> 01:50:30.386
You standa ccused of mayhems that have
placed our brotherhood in jeopardy.


1311
01:50:30.511 --> 01:50:34.181
You stand before your peers--
Masons and doctors both.


1312
01:50:34.265 --> 01:50:38.686
- I have no peers present here.
- What?


1313
01:50:38.769 --> 01:50:42.356
No man amongst you
is fit to judge ... 


1314
01:50:42.481 --> 01:50:45.484
the mighty art that I have wrought.

1315
01:50:45.609 --> 01:50:49.321
Your rituals are empty oaths
you neither understand ... 


1316
01:50:49.446 --> 01:50:51.365
nor live by.

1317
01:50:54.618 --> 01:50:57.788
The Great Architect speaks to me.

1318
01:50:57.913 --> 01:51:00.999
He is the balance where my deeds
are weighed and judged ... 


1319
01:51:03.544 --> 01:51:05.421
not you.

1320
01:51:05.546 --> 01:51:07.673
Knight of the East ...

1321
01:51:07.798 --> 01:51:09.675
hear our judgement.

1322
01:52:00.810 --> 01:52:02.687
Well, they're not watching you anymore.

1323
01:52:07.900 --> 01:52:10.069
I'm telling you, it's
safe to go to her.

1324
01:52:11.320 --> 01:52:13.239
They think she's dead.

1325
01:52:13.322 --> 01:52:16.534
If I disappear or
change my routine suddenly ... 


1326
01:52:16.659 --> 01:52:19.412
they might wonder why.

1327
01:52:19.495 --> 01:52:21.414
You know who you're gonna
turn into, don't you?


1328
01:52:21.497 --> 01:52:24.917
That boring old bugger in the pub
that nobody wants to sit beside.


1329
01:52:25.000 --> 01:52:27.044
'Cause as soon as he's had
a few drinks, he goes on and on ... 


1330
01:52:27.127 --> 01:52:29.254
about the girl that got away.

1331
01:52:29.338 --> 01:52:33.467
Do you want to live
the rest of your life like a ghost?


1332
01:52:34.593 --> 01:52:36.470
No.

1333
01:52:38.055 --> 01:52:41.475
What I want is to go to her.

1334
01:52:41.600 --> 01:52:44.645
But at the slightest hint that she's
a live, they will spare no expense--


1335
01:52:44.770 --> 01:52:47.773
no expense and no trouble.

1336
01:52:47.898 --> 01:52:51.860
So I stay ... and watch them.

1337
01:53:28.939 --> 01:53:32.234
Alice! Alice!

1338
01:53:32.359 --> 01:53:34.319
Come in, darling.

1339
01:53:39.116 --> 01:53:41.118
Coming, Mother.

1340
01:54:24.829 --> 01:54:27.749
Get up.

1341
01:54:27.873 --> 01:54:30.209
Get up! Come on.

1342
01:55:20.009 --> 01:55:22.220
Good night, sweet prince.

1343
01:55:36.400 --> 01:55:46.400
