Nice to meet you.

504
00:51:03.780 --> 00:51:06.700
I mean,
we saw each other already.


505
00:51:07.580 --> 00:51:09.340
But it's great you could come.

506
00:51:12.100 --> 00:51:13.180
You look identical.

507
00:51:14.580 --> 00:51:16.540
Mother has such a great style.

508
00:51:17.020 --> 00:51:18.380
That's true.

509
00:51:19.020 --> 00:51:22.740
Welcome and
make yourself at home.


510
00:51:23.100 --> 00:51:24.820
Isn't this a lovely house?

511
00:51:24.900 --> 00:51:26.940
It's a bit of
a fixer-upper, but...


512
00:51:28.140 --> 00:51:29.420
Hi.

513
00:51:31.100 --> 00:51:32.540
Do you want to see your room?

514
00:51:32.620 --> 00:51:34.220
[baby crying]

515
00:51:34.940 --> 00:51:36.820
Let's go meet Helmi first.

516
00:51:36.900 --> 00:51:39.340
[Mother]
Come, let's go.


517
00:51:42.300 --> 00:51:44.300
[crying continues]

518
00:51:46.660 --> 00:51:49.300
[Mother]
Who do we have here?


519
00:51:51.860 --> 00:51:53.860
Isn't she sweet?

520
00:51:54.460 --> 00:51:57.700
A little princess.

521
00:51:58.380 --> 00:52:01.340
You're so well-behaved
and beautiful.


522
00:52:03.500 --> 00:52:05.020
Tero is a widower.

523
00:52:05.100 --> 00:52:07.340
Helmi's mother
died in childbirth.


524
00:52:07.420 --> 00:52:09.780
But you have us now,
don't you?


525
00:52:09.860 --> 00:52:11.140
Yeah.

526
00:52:12.420 --> 00:52:14.100
Oh.

527
00:52:14.900 --> 00:52:16.900

Everything's okay.

[baby cooing]

537
00:53:23.780 --> 00:53:25.820
[Mother] Move your hands
into the shot.


538
00:53:27.340 --> 00:53:28.820
That's it.

539
00:53:29.300 --> 00:53:31.660
[Tero] Do you really have to
photograph everything?


540
00:53:33.540 --> 00:53:36.060
I might not want to show
my house to the whole world.


541
00:53:36.140 --> 00:53:38.500
No one will know
I took these here.


542
00:53:38.580 --> 00:53:40.860
Look. I cropped you out.

543
00:53:42.300 --> 00:53:43.660
[baby cooing]

544
00:53:43.740 --> 00:53:47.180
Are you a sweet little princess?
Are you?


545
00:53:47.620 --> 00:53:50.100
Here we go.
Let's put this on you.


546
00:53:50.180 --> 00:53:54.500
You're so cute
in this lovely outfit.


547

[chuckling]

548
00:53:56.140 --> 00:53:57.980
- Yes, you are.
- [phone buzzing]


549
00:54:02.860 --> 00:54:04.140
Hi.

550
00:54:07.300 --> 00:54:08.500
Yes?

551
00:54:09.700 --> 00:54:11.300
Eat, by all means.

552
00:54:13.260 --> 00:54:14.660
[Mother] Yes.

553
00:54:17.860 --> 00:54:19.500
[Mother] Where?

554
00:54:25.980 --> 00:54:27.980
- You like it?
- Yeah.


555
00:54:29.980 --> 00:54:32.620
Oh, don't worry about it.

556
00:54:34.620 --> 00:54:37.300
Look. What if I do like this?

557
00:54:37.380 --> 00:54:38.780
- Oops.
- [Mother] Yeah.


558
00:54:38.860 --> 00:54:40.940
Oh, my gosh.

559
00:54:42.620 --> 00:54:45.860
Helmi, let's show her
our table manners.


560
00:54:46.220 --> 00:54:47.700
Oops.

561
00:54:48.020 --> 00:54:51.860
I see.
I mean, that's terrible.

- [gasping]
- [screaming]


566
00:55:50.100 --> 00:55:52.620
That's so awful,

567
00:55:52.700 --> 00:55:54.540
with the competition
coming and all.


568
00:55:55.380 --> 00:55:56.820
But the most important thing

569
00:55:56.900 --> 00:55:58.980
is that you don't let this
affect you.

Why did you do that? Why?

00:56:43.420 --> 00:56:45.580
Let me go, Alli!

575
00:56:45.660 --> 00:56:46.980
Let me go!

What's on your mind?

581
00:58:06.180 --> 00:58:09.580
I was just looking at
the chair.


582
00:58:09.660 --> 00:58:10.660
It's nice.

583
00:58:10.740 --> 00:58:12.980
Yeah. I found it in a dumpster.

584
00:58:13.460 --> 00:58:16.860
People don't treat their things well.

585
00:58:17.220 --> 00:58:22.260
I like fixing them,
broken things like this.


586
00:58:27.060 --> 00:58:28.580
Hey. Um...

587
00:58:29.260 --> 00:58:33.300
I was going to
give you these later,


588
00:58:33.380 --> 00:58:35.820
but I'll give them to you now,

589
00:58:35.900 --> 00:58:37.340
since the competition is
coming and all.


590
00:58:37.420 --> 00:58:38.900
Thank you.

595
00:58:59.300 --> 00:59:00.940
- Are you okay?
- Yes.


596
00:59:02.860 --> 00:59:04.420
Wait, I'll do it again.

597
00:59:10.820 --> 00:59:13.940
- I can do better.
- You don't have to do it now.

What do you mean?

601
00:59:26.100 --> 00:59:28.460
Tinja, do you really like
gymnastics?


602
00:59:28.540 --> 00:59:31.620
- It's a good sport.
- Yes...


603
00:59:33.300 --> 00:59:35.260
I guess it's important
for your mother


604
00:59:35.340 --> 00:59:36.620
that you do well in it.

605

I packed already.

01:01:43.020 --> 01:01:45.540
I can leave when Mother comes
or...


632
01:01:49.100 --> 01:01:52.100
I can take the bus home
if you want.

You'll never have to
see me again.

No one's going anywhere now.

You must think
I'm a horrible person.

You're not a horrible person.

637

I mean, you were a bit
a moment ago.

I'm sorry.

Apology accepted.

01:02:26.900 --> 01:02:29.700
Maybe you've had a bit too much
to process lately.


643
01:02:34.180 --> 01:02:35.980
We'll talk about this
with your mother.


644
01:02:36.060 --> 01:02:37.740
No, don't tell her.

645
01:02:37.820 --> 01:02:41.620
Don't say anything to her.
I'll do anything.


646
01:02:44.060 --> 01:02:46.780
Was that because of the competition?

647

No. I mean...

648
01:02:55.140 --> 01:02:56.420
You can tell me.

649
01:02:59.860 --> 01:03:02.420
Hi! Are you ready?

650
01:03:03.660 --> 01:03:06.380
Let's check your poses,
and then we'll go.


651
01:03:07.100 --> 01:03:09.860
I'll start filming
when you start stretching.

What happened to your hand?

[Tero] I had an accident
in the workshop.

Honey, I've told you to be
careful with your tools.


655
01:03:22.300 --> 01:03:23.780
All right, let's go.

656
01:03:25.980 --> 01:03:29.060
Remember to point your toes
like you showed me.


657
01:03:33.140 --> 01:03:34.780
Cover your ears.

658
01:03:34.860 --> 01:03:37.020
Hey, seriously.

659
01:03:37.100 --> 01:03:40.020
Tinja, you can do better. Hey.

660
01:03:46.860 --> 01:03:49.940
Tinja, it's only a question of focus.

I'm sorry, honey.

Did we wake you up?

664
01:03:58.900 --> 01:04:02.500
Was Tinja too loud? Was she?

665
01:04:04.740 --> 01:04:07.900
Who's Mother's darling baby?
Who?


666
01:04:08.300 --> 01:04:09.420
Who?

667
01:04:12.580 --> 01:04:14.340
All right, Tinja, we gotta go.

668
01:04:16.500 --> 01:04:18.300
Good luck!
