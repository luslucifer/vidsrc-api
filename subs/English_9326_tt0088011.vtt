1
00:00:55.916 --> 00:00:58.169
What's it gonna be, Angelina?

2
00:00:58.252 --> 00:01:03.298
<i>It was Grogan - the filthiest, dirtiest, dumbest</i>
<i>excuse for a man west of the Missouri River.</i>


3
00:01:03.381 --> 00:01:05.760
You can die two ways, angel.

4
00:01:05.843 --> 00:01:08.137
Quick, like the tongue of a snake,

5
00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:11.307
or slower than the molasses in January.

6
00:01:13.267 --> 00:01:17.480
<i>- But it was October...</i>
- I'll kill ya, damn it, if it's the Fourth of July.


7
00:01:17.563 --> 00:01:19.857
Where is it?

8
00:01:25.237 --> 00:01:27.782
Get over there.

9
00:01:32.203 --> 00:01:36.040
<i>I told him to get out,</i>
<i>now that he had what he came for.</i>


10
00:01:36.165 --> 00:01:38.543
Not quite, angel.

11
00:01:39.461 --> 00:01:42.214
Take 'em off. Do it.

12
00:01:55.936 --> 00:01:58.021
Come on.

13
00:02:14.413 --> 00:02:17.791
<i>That was the end of Grogan,</i>
<i>the man who killed my father,</i>


14
00:02:17.874 --> 00:02:20.961
<i>raped and murdered my sister,</i>
<i>burned my ranch,</i>


15
00:02:21.044 --> 00:02:24.381
<i>shot my dog and stole my Bible.</i>

16
00:02:39.104 --> 00:02:41.648
<i>But if there was
one law of the West,</i>

17
00:02:41.732 --> 00:02:44.609
<i>bastards had brothers</i>

18
00:02:45.277 --> 00:02:48.155
<i>who seemed to ride forever.</i>

19
00:02:50.365 --> 00:02:54.494
<i>But suddenly there he was,</i>
<i>my beloved Jessie.</i>


20
00:03:04.589 --> 00:03:08.509
<i>He was the one man
I trusted, the only man.</i>

21
00:03:10.928 --> 00:03:14.307
<i>My heart leapt as
I watched him ride near.</i>

22
00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:17.810
<i>I could barely wait to feel</i>
<i>the warmth of his touch.</i>


23
00:03:38.873 --> 00:03:44.087
<i>At the moment his lips met mine,</i>
<i>I knew that we would never again be apart.</i>


24
00:03:56.265 --> 00:04:00.103
<i>I knew then that we would spend</i>
<i>the rest of our lives together.</i>


25
00:04:01.354 --> 00:04:03.439
Forever.

26
00:04:05.108 --> 00:04:07.652
Oh, God, that's good.

27
00:04:17.203 --> 00:04:19.498
The...

28
00:04:19.581 --> 00:04:21.667
...End.

29
00:05:11.592 --> 00:05:15.512
I finished, sweetheart. 
You wanna celebrate?

30
00:05:18.182 --> 00:05:20.100
So do I.

31
00:05:56.596 --> 00:06:00.016
Romeo, Romeo. Where art thou, Romeo?

32
00:06:03.144 --> 00:06:05.063
It's Bumble Bee, kiddo.

33
00:06:05.146 --> 00:06:09.067
Just so you know,
I spare no expense when I celebrate.


34
00:06:53.737 --> 00:06:56.406
Here's looking at you, Jessie.

35
00:06:57.824 --> 00:06:59.910
Whoever you are.

36
00:07:13.049 --> 00:07:15.176
Are you finished?

37
00:07:15.593 --> 00:07:17.219
Thank you.

38
00:07:24.602 --> 00:07:27.605
Come here, Romeo.

39
00:08:17.196 --> 00:08:19.282
Hello?

40
00:08:27.666 --> 00:08:30.210
Oh, my God, Romeo. 
Is that the time?

41
00:08:30.335 --> 00:08:33.380
Gloria. I'm gonna be late.

42
00:08:52.733 --> 00:08:55.068
- Hi.
- Hi, pumpkin.


43
00:08:57.070 --> 00:09:00.282
Mrs Irwin, why won't you take the elevator?

44
00:09:00.365 --> 00:09:04.995
Oh, pumpkin, I never get in an elevator alone.
You know - rapists.


45
00:09:05.078 --> 00:09:09.333
- Where are you running off to?
- I've got to get to my publisher's.


46
00:09:10.125 --> 00:09:16.381
By the way, the mailman couldn't fit this
into your box, so I told him I'd give it to you.


47
00:09:16.548 --> 00:09:18.634
Some love letter.

48
00:09:21.470 --> 00:09:25.724
- Mrs Irwin, you're a tease.
- I know, but I keep hoping for you, pumpkin.


49
00:09:36.693 --> 00:09:39.237
Hey, lady.
How about a monkey for your nephew?


50
00:09:39.363 --> 00:09:42.325
I'll give you it for $10. Great deal.

51
00:09:42.408 --> 00:09:45.912
It's really nice.
Your boyfriend'll love it. It's kinda kinky.


52
00:09:46.746 --> 00:09:49.290
$9. $8, bottom line.

53
00:09:49.415 --> 00:09:52.293
Thank you, but I
really don't need a monkey.

54
00:09:52.377 --> 00:09:54.671
But, lady, it's kinda cute...

55
00:09:59.050 --> 00:10:01.678
Hey. That's Miss Wilder's apartment.

56
00:10:02.095 --> 00:10:04.180
Can I help you?

57
00:10:09.686 --> 00:10:11.771
Excuse me.

58
00:10:12.605 --> 00:10:15.316
Get away from that door.

59
00:10:15.400 --> 00:10:17.944
What's this?

60
00:10:23.700 --> 00:10:26.577
Wimp. Wimp.

61
00:10:26.828 --> 00:10:30.248
Loser. Loser.

62
00:10:30.331 --> 00:10:32.417
Major loser.

63
00:10:34.419 --> 00:10:36.963
Too angry. Too vague.

64
00:10:37.714 --> 00:10:41.551
Too desperate. 
God, too happy.

65
00:10:42.552 --> 00:10:45.471
Look at this guy.
Mr Mondo-dizmo. I used to date him.


66
00:10:45.555 --> 00:10:48.016
Total sleaze bucket.

67
00:10:48.099 --> 00:10:50.184
Wait a minute.

68
00:10:50.268 --> 00:10:54.314
Hold everything. 
Get a load of this character.

69
00:10:54.605 --> 00:10:56.899
Now what about him?

70
00:10:56.983 --> 00:10:59.861
No, he's just not...

71
00:10:59.944 --> 00:11:02.197
Who? Jessie?

72
00:11:02.489 --> 00:11:07.161
Maybe it's silly, but I know that
there is somebody out there for me.


73
00:11:07.578 --> 00:11:10.039
Oh, yeah? Where?

74
00:11:10.706 --> 00:11:13.417
Certainly not here.

75
00:11:13.500 --> 00:11:16.712
Gloria, why do we always
have to have this same conversation?


76
00:11:16.795 --> 00:11:19.965
Because I like you, Joan,
and I hate to see you all alone,


77
00:11:20.049 --> 00:11:23.177
waiting for somebody
who's not gonna show up.


78
00:11:23.260 --> 00:11:26.138
OK, Gloria.

79
00:11:28.641 --> 00:11:30.726
Here it is.

80
00:11:32.645 --> 00:11:35.856
Read it and weep. I always do.

81
00:11:37.983 --> 00:11:41.737
- I'll call you, OK?
- Come on. Have another grasshopper.


82
00:11:41.862 --> 00:11:45.699
- I can't.
- I'm your publisher. I'm ordering you to.


83
00:11:47.326 --> 00:11:52.289
I'm sorry I even dragged you to this place.
I just wanted you to get out.


84
00:11:52.373 --> 00:11:56.877
I know how hard you've been working.
I know you're upset about your sister.


85
00:11:56.961 --> 00:11:59.421
How is she? Have you heard from her?

86
00:11:59.505 --> 00:12:03.926
Elaine? I spoke to her last week.
She's still in Colombia.


87
00:12:04.009 --> 00:12:07.680
Have they found her husband's body yet?

88
00:12:08.597 --> 00:12:11.558
Just the one piece.

89
00:12:12.142 --> 00:12:16.689
You know what's creepy?
I got this package from Eduardo.


90
00:12:16.772 --> 00:12:19.566
Must have been mailed just before he...

91
00:12:20.818 --> 00:12:22.612
God.

92
00:12:22.696 --> 00:12:25.740
Can you imagine?
Having your husband murdered.


93
00:12:25.824 --> 00:12:27.909
How is she holding up?

94
00:12:27.993 --> 00:12:32.497
Oh, she'll be fine. 
Elaine always manages.

95
00:12:33.915 --> 00:12:37.043
CARTAGENA, COLOMBIA

96
00:14:24.610 --> 00:14:26.696
Hey, Ira.

97
00:14:28.239 --> 00:14:31.742
The kid's here with the broad.
They're taking her to the boat.


98
00:14:31.867 --> 00:14:33.953
Look at these snappers, will ya?

99
00:14:35.955 --> 00:14:38.249
We shoulda just rifled her room.

100
00:14:38.332 --> 00:14:42.169
Ralph, how many times do I have to tell you?
It's not in the country.


101
00:14:42.253 --> 00:14:45.256
This kidnapping stuff makes me real nervous.

102
00:14:47.633 --> 00:14:50.928
It's a piss-poor idea. 
It's nothing but trouble.

103
00:14:51.012 --> 00:14:54.515
Look. We've stolen enough
of these antique trinkets


104
00:14:54.640 --> 00:14:57.727
to keep us living comfortably
for the rest of our lives.


105
00:14:57.810 --> 00:14:59.937
Let's kiss off this Third World toilet.

106
00:15:00.021 --> 00:15:03.317
One last big one. Trust me, Ralph.

107
00:15:04.192 --> 00:15:07.863
Did you see that? That ugly,
striped son of a bitch down there?


108
00:15:07.946 --> 00:15:11.992
Somebody's gonna get killed, and you
fart around with prehistoric animals.


109
00:15:12.075 --> 00:15:16.455
Come on, Ira. Let's forget this one.
I got a real bad feeling about it.


110
00:15:16.538 --> 00:15:19.249
Will you stop worrying?
Have I ever hurt you?


111
00:15:19.333 --> 00:15:23.337
I will never hurt you. I can't hurt you.
We got the same blood.


112
00:15:23.420 --> 00:15:28.467
We're not two people. We are one person.
Would I hurt me?


113
00:15:30.552 --> 00:15:32.429
Look at those snappers.

114
00:16:11.885 --> 00:16:14.972
Romeo. Oh, baby.

115
00:16:20.185 --> 00:16:22.647
- Hello?
- Hello, Joan?


116
00:16:22.772 --> 00:16:25.525
- <i>Can you hear me?</i>
- Elaine? I can't talk right now.


117
00:16:25.608 --> 00:16:29.278
Listen to me. Listen very carefully.

118
00:16:29.404 --> 00:16:32.824
- I'm in trouble.
- Elaine, please.


119
00:16:32.907 --> 00:16:37.328
<i>- Joanie, I am in real trouble.</i>
- What's the matter?


120
00:16:37.412 --> 00:16:41.749
<i>Has any mail been forwarded to you</i>
<i>with Eduardo's handwriting on it?</i>


121
00:16:41.833 --> 00:16:43.918
<i>Any big envelope?</i>

122
00:16:44.002 --> 00:16:46.045
- Yes.
<i>- Oh. Honey...</i>


123
00:16:46.129 --> 00:16:49.882
<i>See if there's some kind</i>
<i>of treasure map inside.</i>


124
00:16:51.676 --> 00:16:54.512
It says <i>El Coraz√≥n.</i>

125
00:16:54.595 --> 00:16:58.516
I need you to bring that map
to me in Colombia.


126
00:16:59.934 --> 00:17:02.020
Colombia?

127
00:17:04.314 --> 00:17:06.441
My God. What kind
of trouble are you in?

128
00:17:06.524 --> 00:17:08.484
Joanie, please...

129
00:17:08.568 --> 00:17:12.947
Get to the Hotel Cartagena in Cartagena.

130
00:17:13.031 --> 00:17:15.325
<i>When you arrive, call this number.</i>

131
00:17:15.450 --> 00:17:18.411
<i>64-58-24.</i>

132
00:17:18.494 --> 00:17:20.580
<i>- Are you writing this down?</i>
- Yes.


133
00:17:20.663 --> 00:17:24.083
And remember, you mustn't tell anybody.

134
00:17:26.377 --> 00:17:29.589
Elaine, I can't go to Colombia.

135
00:17:31.924 --> 00:17:33.009
Joanie?

136
00:17:33.092 --> 00:17:36.387
<i>They'll cut me. 
They'll hurt me.</i>

137
00:17:41.601 --> 00:17:47.066
Do you know what it's like in Colombia? I do.
You sell very well in these macho countries.


138
00:17:47.149 --> 00:17:51.195
They have jungles there, Joanie.
Insects the size of sanitation trucks.


139
00:17:51.278 --> 00:17:55.115
- Revolutionaries. Have you had your shots?
- Shots? What shots?


140
00:17:55.240 --> 00:17:58.077
See? You're completely unprepared.
Wait a minute.


141
00:17:58.160 --> 00:18:02.539
Would you tell me what's going on?
Why are you doing this?


142
00:18:02.623 --> 00:18:05.000
Elaine is in some trouble.

143
00:18:05.125 --> 00:18:07.836
She has a little domestic problem.

144
00:18:07.920 --> 00:18:12.591
Elaine's last domestic problem was
finding her husband cut into small pieces.


145
00:18:12.675 --> 00:18:15.719
I'm not gonna let you do this. 
You cannot go!

146
00:18:15.803 --> 00:18:22.726
Here's Romeo. I want you to promise me
to feed him and hold him at least once a day.


147
00:18:25.771 --> 00:18:28.399
You'll need something stronger than that.

148
00:18:28.482 --> 00:18:32.611
Listen to me. You get bus sick,
seasick, plane sick, train sick.


149
00:18:32.695 --> 00:18:36.448
You practically puke
riding on the escalator at Bloomingdale's!


150
00:18:36.573 --> 00:18:39.451
Well, a lot of people
get sick in department stores.


151
00:18:39.535 --> 00:18:41.704
Joanie, please. Don't go.

152
00:18:43.247 --> 00:18:46.834
You're not up to this, 
Joan, and you know it.

153
00:18:46.959 --> 00:18:50.129
I know, but she's my sister.

154
00:18:52.381 --> 00:18:55.759
I'll feed him, but
I'm not picking him up.

155
00:19:06.730 --> 00:19:08.815
You're crazy.

156
00:19:59.991 --> 00:20:03.745
The plane from New
York, has it arrived yet?

157
00:20:13.088 --> 00:20:16.049
Is this the bus to Cartagena?

158
00:20:24.057 --> 00:20:26.102
Cartagena?

159
00:20:26.185 --> 00:20:28.813
Oh, you speak English. Good.

160
00:20:28.896 --> 00:20:33.484
Can you tell me,
is this bus going to Cartagena?


161
00:20:34.318 --> 00:20:36.779
Yes. Cartagena.

162
00:20:36.904 --> 00:20:39.365
Great. Thank you.

163
00:20:44.829 --> 00:20:46.664
Thank you.

164
00:21:09.562 --> 00:21:12.440
Hey, you're on the wrong bus!

165
00:21:12.523 --> 00:21:15.776
Miss Wilder!
She got on the wrong bus. This is terrible.


166
00:22:19.257 --> 00:22:21.343
Excuse me.

167
00:22:36.108 --> 00:22:38.193
Excuse me.

168
00:22:42.197 --> 00:22:45.409
I'm very sorry. 
I'm really sorry.

169
00:22:53.083 --> 00:22:56.003
I'm sorry to bother you.

170
00:22:56.086 --> 00:22:59.589
Can you tell me
what time we get to Cartagena?


171
00:23:00.382 --> 00:23:02.592
Is this the bus to Cartagena?

172
00:23:02.718 --> 00:23:04.845
I need to get to Cartagen...

173
00:23:44.093 --> 00:23:46.471
What are we gonna do now?

174
00:23:48.097 --> 00:23:50.141
Where's my suitcase?

175
00:24:06.616 --> 00:24:09.869
You don't have to walk.
Another bus will come along.


176
00:24:11.204 --> 00:24:12.872
What?

177
00:24:12.956 --> 00:24:16.084
They know nothing. 
They are peasants.

178
00:24:16.167 --> 00:24:18.503
Another bus? Really?

179
00:24:18.586 --> 00:24:20.254
Of course.

180
00:24:20.338 --> 00:24:22.715
There are schedules to be maintained,

181
00:24:22.840 --> 00:24:25.969
even in Colombia.

182
00:25:15.853 --> 00:25:17.855
- What?
- The purse.


183
00:25:17.938 --> 00:25:20.316
What do you...

184
00:26:38.728 --> 00:26:41.773
What the hell...?

185
00:26:42.482 --> 00:26:46.319
Jesus Christ!
What the hell happened to my birds?


186
00:26:48.738 --> 00:26:50.824
Son of a bitch!

187
00:27:08.301 --> 00:27:10.386
Hi.

188
00:27:18.352 --> 00:27:21.856
<i>I demand this car in
the name of the law.</i>

189
00:27:21.939 --> 00:27:23.649
<i>Turn the car around. Let's go!</i>

190
00:27:23.733 --> 00:27:26.527
Oh, no. Talk about breaks.

191
00:27:40.124 --> 00:27:42.460
Don't I know you?

192
00:27:45.129 --> 00:27:47.214
You are American.

193
00:27:52.720 --> 00:27:57.767
I spit on 'em. I hate <i>americanos.</i>
They're scumo. Scum.


194
00:27:59.602 --> 00:28:01.562
<i>Are you French?</i>

195
00:28:12.073 --> 00:28:16.160
Well, honey, looks like we're gonna
have to wait just a little longer.


196
00:28:21.499 --> 00:28:25.252
Excuse me. Could you please
tell me how to get to a telephone?


197
00:28:26.879 --> 00:28:31.301
- No, lady. I don't have any idea. I'm sorry.
- It's very important that I get one.


198
00:28:31.385 --> 00:28:34.930
Well, we've all got
our problems today, don't we?


199
00:28:35.013 --> 00:28:37.391
Can you tell me
where the nearest town is?

200
00:28:37.474 --> 00:28:41.395
- How about Miami?
- Will there be another bus?


201
00:28:41.520 --> 00:28:45.273
This is it. You got rush hour.

202
00:28:46.191 --> 00:28:49.695
- I have to get to Cartagena.
- Cartagena?


203
00:28:49.820 --> 00:28:54.574
Angel, you are hell and gone from Cartagena.
Cartagena's over there on the coast.


204
00:28:54.658 --> 00:28:57.786
- But they told me this bus...
- Who told you that?


205
00:28:58.161 --> 00:29:01.456
- That man that...
- That nice man who pulled a gun on you.


206
00:29:02.624 --> 00:29:04.751
What else did he tell you?

207
00:29:06.295 --> 00:29:09.506
- Please, I need your help.
- That's my new career, huh?


208
00:29:09.589 --> 00:29:12.050
- It's very imp...
- Lady.


209
00:29:12.134 --> 00:29:15.721
Half a year's work just flew south
for the winter, all right?


210
00:29:15.846 --> 00:29:17.931
My Jeep is totalled.

211
00:29:18.015 --> 00:29:22.811
In about five minutes, everything I own
is gonna be wet. So could you lighten up?


212
00:29:23.270 --> 00:29:28.608
I'll pay you. You don't understand.
It's a matter of life and death...


213
00:29:28.692 --> 00:29:30.694
How much?

214
00:29:32.404 --> 00:29:34.489
$50?

215
00:29:36.950 --> 00:29:39.661
You said you lost everything you owned.

216
00:29:39.745 --> 00:29:44.041
- Not my sense of humour.
- I'll pay you $100.


217
00:29:44.124 --> 00:29:46.209
200.

218
00:29:53.009 --> 00:29:55.094
I'll do it.

219
00:29:56.429 --> 00:29:59.474
- For five.
- What?


220
00:30:01.142 --> 00:30:03.603
I'll pay you $250.

221
00:30:04.604 --> 00:30:08.274
Now, I ain't cheap,
but I can be had.

222
00:30:09.859 --> 00:30:14.739
My minimum price for taking
a stranded woman to a telephone is $400.


223
00:30:16.157 --> 00:30:19.577
- Will you take 375 in traveller's cheques?
- American Express?


224
00:30:19.661 --> 00:30:22.497
- Of course.
- You got a deal.


225
00:30:22.580 --> 00:30:24.374
Good.

226
00:31:04.247 --> 00:31:06.416
<i>- Assemble your men!</i>
<i>- Yes, sir!</i>


227
00:31:40.034 --> 00:31:42.286
You got any valuables in that suitcase?

228
00:31:42.369 --> 00:31:45.789
No. Yes, all my clothes and things.

229
00:31:45.914 --> 00:31:49.293
- You got an umbrella?
- No.


230
00:31:50.044 --> 00:31:54.214
- You got a good pair of walking shoes?
- They're all like these.


231
00:32:09.396 --> 00:32:11.774
OK, let's make some time.

232
00:32:12.691 --> 00:32:14.485
You ba...!

233
00:33:03.994 --> 00:33:06.705
Goddamn it, what a ride, huh?

234
00:33:08.540 --> 00:33:12.585
I'm telling you, this is turning out
to be one hell of a morning.


235
00:33:14.379 --> 00:33:17.048
You OK?

236
00:33:17.132 --> 00:33:19.092
I said, are you hurt?

237
00:33:19.175 --> 00:33:22.804
What's the matter? Paralysed
from the neck up? Are you hurt?


238
00:33:22.887 --> 00:33:25.348
- No.
- Good.


239
00:33:25.432 --> 00:33:28.310
What's your name?

240
00:33:28.393 --> 00:33:30.687
I'm Joan Wilder.

241
00:33:31.563 --> 00:33:34.649
Joan Wilder, welcome to Colombia.

242
00:33:44.784 --> 00:33:46.286
Ira...

243
00:33:46.369 --> 00:33:48.747
Oh, hi, Ma. It's me, Irving.

244
00:33:48.872 --> 00:33:53.169
<i>- Ralph, you little twerp, where are you?</i>
- Calm down, Ma. Who says I never call?


245
00:33:53.252 --> 00:33:55.338
<i>For Christ's sake, tell me the story.</i>

246
00:33:55.421 --> 00:33:59.550
All right, cousin. As usual,
you got us in some serious shit here.


247
00:33:59.634 --> 00:34:02.803
First of all, the stupid dame
got on the wrong bus.


248
00:34:02.887 --> 00:34:07.099
Now I'm stuck in some kind
of spicko military compound.


249
00:34:08.392 --> 00:34:11.103
They're mobilising for lwo Jima here.

250
00:34:11.896 --> 00:34:14.857
<i>- Do they know who you are?</i>
- What do you think?


251
00:34:14.940 --> 00:34:18.944
I'm going up, introducing
myself to every cop in the <i>pueblo?</i>


252
00:34:19.779 --> 00:34:22.698
And another little tidbit, cousin.

253
00:34:22.782 --> 00:34:25.326
Guess who else is here?

254
00:34:25.409 --> 00:34:29.080
- Zolo.
- Well, give the man a cigar.


255
00:34:29.163 --> 00:34:32.667
You're goddamned right, Zolo.
He got in my car.


256
00:34:32.750 --> 00:34:37.546
Not only are we kidnappers, but I'm about
to have a close encounter with a cattle prod.


257
00:34:37.630 --> 00:34:40.174
<i>- Has he got his boys with him?</i>
- No, no, no.


258
00:34:40.299 --> 00:34:42.468
He's making do with the local yo-yos.

259
00:34:43.970 --> 00:34:47.056
Oh, no.

260
00:34:47.556 --> 00:34:50.559
- Look.
<i>- Goddamn it, Ralph. Get that map.</i>


261
00:34:50.643 --> 00:34:52.770
Don't yell at me, Ira. 
Don't yell at me.

262
00:34:52.853 --> 00:34:54.855
Look, you wanna kill me?

263
00:34:54.939 --> 00:34:59.735
Take me back to Queens and kill me. Don't let
me die in a jungle like a goddamned snake.


264
00:34:59.860 --> 00:35:04.031
<i>Ralph, goddamn it, I don't care</i>
<i>what you gotta do. Just get me that map.</i>


265
00:35:08.869 --> 00:35:12.040
Little sister took the wrong road.

266
00:35:12.124 --> 00:35:17.337
And that third party I told you about,
he's tagging along.


267
00:35:17.462 --> 00:35:22.342
- The man who killed my husband?
- The butcher who killed your husband.


268
00:35:22.467 --> 00:35:26.305
A very powerful man with
his own private army to back him up.


269
00:35:26.430 --> 00:35:30.851
And whether he calls himself
Dr Zolo, Minister of Antiquities,


270
00:35:30.934 --> 00:35:34.771
or Colonel Zolo,
Deputy Commander of the Secret Police,


271
00:35:34.896 --> 00:35:37.357
he's still just a butcher.

272
00:35:41.486 --> 00:35:44.531
Look at those snappers, will ya?

273
00:35:57.127 --> 00:36:02.049
- What's the matter? You sick?
- No. I lost my button.


274
00:36:02.758 --> 00:36:07.179
- You lost what?
- I lost my button.


275
00:36:07.262 --> 00:36:10.390
You're gonna lose a lot more than that.

276
00:36:26.531 --> 00:36:29.493
- These were Italian.
- Now they're practical.


277
00:36:29.576 --> 00:36:32.914
Is nothing that I own sacred to you?

278
00:36:33.039 --> 00:36:35.583
Only your $375.

279
00:36:41.839 --> 00:36:44.133
Cops.

280
00:36:44.717 --> 00:36:47.261
What the hell do they want?

281
00:36:47.387 --> 00:36:49.847
I haven't done anything lately.

282
00:36:57.438 --> 00:36:59.983
I'm shooting at a cop.

283
00:37:01.901 --> 00:37:04.529
Wait a minute. 
He's after you.

284
00:37:05.822 --> 00:37:09.993
- Who the hell are you?
- I'm a romance novelist.


285
00:37:10.076 --> 00:37:12.161
You're what?

286
00:37:13.204 --> 00:37:17.458
- What are you doing here?
- I told you. My sister's life depends on me.


287
00:37:17.542 --> 00:37:22.672
Don't give me that shit. I thought
you were donating a kidney or something.


288
00:37:23.047 --> 00:37:24.924
Christ, here they come.

289
00:37:25.008 --> 00:37:28.177
This may be a good time
to try on those shoes.


290
00:37:35.560 --> 00:37:38.271
- Wait.
- Deal's off, lady.


291
00:37:39.897 --> 00:37:41.357
Wait!

292
00:37:47.238 --> 00:37:49.907
Lady, you are bad news.

293
00:37:54.955 --> 00:37:57.750
What'd you do?
Wake up this morning and say,


294
00:37:57.833 --> 00:38:00.669
"Today I'm gonna ruin a man's life"?

295
00:38:13.891 --> 00:38:17.061
- Do you know where you're going?
- Looks like a trail.


296
00:38:17.144 --> 00:38:19.521
This is a trail?

297
00:38:33.994 --> 00:38:36.205
Lady, you are a jinx.

298
00:38:37.915 --> 00:38:40.000
What about the bridge?

299
00:38:40.918 --> 00:38:43.963
That ain't a bridge.
It's goddamn pre-Columbian art.


300
00:38:44.046 --> 00:38:46.256
We can't get across that.

301
00:38:50.928 --> 00:38:52.930
All right.

302
00:38:53.013 --> 00:38:57.351
We're gonna hold them off right from here.
You just stay right behind me.


303
00:38:58.602 --> 00:39:02.022
Goddamn it.
I knew I should've listened to my mother.


304
00:39:24.337 --> 00:39:28.967
I could've been a cosmetic surgeon.

305
00:39:42.814 --> 00:39:44.941
Lady, I hope you're taking notes,

306
00:39:45.025 --> 00:39:48.945
cos you got a real-live death scene
going on right here.


307
00:39:59.581 --> 00:40:01.791
Romantic novelist, my ass.

308
00:40:40.331 --> 00:40:42.416
Holy shit.

309
00:41:33.009 --> 00:41:37.054
<i>- We can't cross.</i>
<i>- We won't catch them up.</i>


310
00:41:37.096 --> 00:41:39.432
What the hell are you doing?

311
00:41:40.141 --> 00:41:44.061
Drinkin'? I could've been killed,
and you're drinkin'?


312
00:41:49.317 --> 00:41:50.318
Wait.

313
00:41:50.693 --> 00:41:53.237
<i>Oh, yes. I will
catch them up. Let's go!</i>

314
00:42:15.010 --> 00:42:17.095
Are we stopping?

315
00:42:27.272 --> 00:42:29.483
Be my guest.

316
00:43:27.333 --> 00:43:29.419
You OK?

317
00:43:39.429 --> 00:43:41.514
Come on.

318
00:44:03.119 --> 00:44:05.997
- Is anybody else in there?
- No.


319
00:44:06.080 --> 00:44:08.958
No, it's a cargo plane.

320
00:44:10.460 --> 00:44:12.712
What is all this?

321
00:44:12.795 --> 00:44:17.800
All this? About five to life in the States.
A couple of centuries down here.


322
00:44:17.884 --> 00:44:20.178
Oh, marijuana.

323
00:44:20.261 --> 00:44:22.347
Oh, you smoke it?

324
00:44:23.348 --> 00:44:25.892
I went to college.

325
00:44:26.017 --> 00:44:27.477
Sure.

326
00:45:04.848 --> 00:45:07.226
All right. OK.

327
00:45:10.771 --> 00:45:13.899
Oh, God, do I love those flyboys.

328
00:45:33.043 --> 00:45:35.587
What?

329
00:45:35.671 --> 00:45:38.799
This is Elaine's favourite drink.

330
00:45:48.058 --> 00:45:51.186
You gonna tell me
about that sister of yours?

331
00:45:53.480 --> 00:45:55.567
I already did.

332
00:46:00.947 --> 00:46:06.786
Her husband died and
I've come down here to comfort her.


333
00:46:10.915 --> 00:46:13.001
It's the truth.

334
00:46:18.506 --> 00:46:21.635
Right. Yeah, it's the truth.

335
00:46:25.221 --> 00:46:28.433
All right. I'm gonna make a fire.

336
00:46:33.188 --> 00:46:36.024
You got any dry matches in here?

337
00:46:39.778 --> 00:46:41.863
Well, looky here.

338
00:46:44.991 --> 00:46:47.285
Oh, no, don't!

339
00:46:51.706 --> 00:46:54.376
You and I ought to have a talk.

340
00:46:57.504 --> 00:46:59.589
All right.

341
00:47:07.514 --> 00:47:10.976
Yeah, that's what I call a campfire.

342
00:47:19.485 --> 00:47:24.073
So they're ransoming your sister
for this <i>El Coraz√≥n.</i>


343
00:47:24.991 --> 00:47:28.119
That's Spanish for "the heart".

344
00:47:28.911 --> 00:47:32.289
This map here leads to the heart.

345
00:47:33.499 --> 00:47:36.293
But the heart of what?

346
00:47:37.086 --> 00:47:39.171
I don't care.

347
00:47:43.175 --> 00:47:49.098
You see here where it says this <i>El Coraz√≥n</i>
is hidden in C√≥rdoba province?


348
00:47:49.181 --> 00:47:52.351
So we're sitting right
in the middle of it.

349
00:47:52.435 --> 00:47:56.355
All I care about is my sister.
And that map is her life.


350
00:47:57.189 --> 00:48:00.943
Like hell it is. Whatever's at the end
of this map is your sister's life.


351
00:48:01.068 --> 00:48:04.822
Now, we get our
hands on this <i>El Coraz√≥n,</i>

352
00:48:04.947 --> 00:48:08.075
then you got something to bargain with.

353
00:48:08.826 --> 00:48:12.413
- I knew it would happen.
- You knew what would happen?


354
00:48:12.496 --> 00:48:16.751
All you care about is yourself. I knew that
from the moment I laid eyes on you.


355
00:48:16.834 --> 00:48:19.712
Oh, was that the first moment
when I saved your ass?


356
00:48:19.837 --> 00:48:25.384
You see? There you go.
You have no finesse, no style.


357
00:48:25.468 --> 00:48:29.639
A real man doesn't have to
draw attention to his actions.


358
00:48:29.722 --> 00:48:33.726
You're just... 
You're a mondo-dizmo.

359
00:48:35.478 --> 00:48:37.522
What am I?

360
00:48:37.606 --> 00:48:41.193
You're a man who takes money
from stranded women.


361
00:48:41.276 --> 00:48:46.031
A real man is honest and forthright,

362
00:48:46.114 --> 00:48:47.991
and trustworthy.

363
00:48:50.619 --> 00:48:55.374
Would you please do me the courtesy of
looking at me when I'm speaking to you?


364
00:48:55.457 --> 00:48:58.585
I mean, this is
exactly what I'm talking about.

365
00:48:58.669 --> 00:49:01.046
If you had any kind of manners...

366
00:49:26.822 --> 00:49:29.533
Goddamn bushmaster.

367
00:49:29.616 --> 00:49:31.702
Is it poisonous?

368
00:49:31.785 --> 00:49:34.079
Yeah...

369
00:49:34.162 --> 00:49:37.290
But very tasty.

370
00:50:20.793 --> 00:50:24.631
See, you gotta figure
sulphur-crested cockatoos,


371
00:50:24.756 --> 00:50:28.343
they go for about 800 a shot.

372
00:50:28.426 --> 00:50:32.972
Then you got gentle red-tails.
They're close to 2,000 each.


373
00:50:34.849 --> 00:50:39.354
I figure I lost close to 15,000 bucks
in that bus crash.


374
00:50:39.979 --> 00:50:42.065
Wow.

375
00:50:43.650 --> 00:50:45.735
You want to know something crazy?

376
00:50:45.818 --> 00:50:49.030
- What?
- I don't even know your name.


377
00:50:49.113 --> 00:50:51.741
Well, you never asked me.

378
00:50:54.619 --> 00:51:00.792
- Excuse me. I'd really like to know.
- Colton. Jack T Colton.


379
00:51:01.834 --> 00:51:04.379
- What does the T stand for?
- Goddamn it, man.


380
00:51:04.504 --> 00:51:07.256
The Doobie Brothers broke up.

381
00:51:07.340 --> 00:51:11.886
- When did that happen?
- How long have you been down here?


382
00:51:13.429 --> 00:51:16.432
Forever. I don't know.

383
00:51:16.516 --> 00:51:19.937
Were you always into birds?

384
00:51:20.020 --> 00:51:23.107
No, no. I was...

385
00:51:24.900 --> 00:51:27.778
I was into shortcuts.

386
00:51:27.861 --> 00:51:30.823
Birds just seemed to be
a fast way to get what I wanted.


387
00:51:30.906 --> 00:51:34.326
And a hell of a lot healthier
than dealing in this crap.


388
00:51:35.452 --> 00:51:37.997
What is it you want?

389
00:51:42.209 --> 00:51:47.339
- I think I'll throw another key on the fire.
- No, please. I'm getting dizzy.


390
00:51:49.591 --> 00:51:53.012
What do you want, seriously?

391
00:51:53.095 --> 00:51:55.472
I'd really like to know.

392
00:52:00.144 --> 00:52:04.315
Came down here on a coffee boat
about a year and a half ago, right?


393
00:52:05.024 --> 00:52:07.776
Christ, what a job that was.

394
00:52:09.111 --> 00:52:12.489
But I couldn't get
over that ocean, you know.

395
00:52:13.407 --> 00:52:16.744
Yeah, I love the ocean.

396
00:52:17.453 --> 00:52:22.666
You know, you just gotta
get out there all by yourself.


397
00:52:22.791 --> 00:52:25.336
Nobody else around.

398
00:52:25.461 --> 00:52:27.546
It's beautiful.

399
00:52:29.715 --> 00:52:31.800
So that's what I want.

400
00:52:31.884 --> 00:52:36.347
Try to get enough money together,
buy a boat, sail around the world.


401
00:52:37.723 --> 00:52:41.561
So you're just gonna sail away,
all by yourself?


402
00:52:44.147 --> 00:52:46.608
Yeah.

403
00:52:46.691 --> 00:52:49.402
Sounds lonely, 
Jack T Colton.

404
00:53:01.873 --> 00:53:03.875
Well,

405
00:53:03.958 --> 00:53:07.087
what does the T stand for?

406
00:53:09.422 --> 00:53:11.508
Trustworthy.

407
00:53:27.816 --> 00:53:31.569
Man, I tell ya...
one hell of a morning.

408
00:53:32.362 --> 00:53:35.490
It's turned into a bitch of a day.

409
00:53:56.136 --> 00:53:58.221
<i>Tenedor del Diablo.</i>

410
00:54:02.143 --> 00:54:04.228
The Devil's Fork.

411
00:54:30.171 --> 00:54:31.005
Zolo.

412
00:54:55.029 --> 00:54:58.366
- Friendly, aren't they?
- Drug runners.


413
00:54:59.200 --> 00:55:01.494
Just try to look mean.

414
00:55:09.919 --> 00:55:11.962
- What's the matter?
- Nothing.


415
00:55:36.363 --> 00:55:38.448
- OK, here we go.
- What?


416
00:55:38.532 --> 00:55:41.576
I knew I should
have listened to my mother.

417
00:55:43.704 --> 00:55:45.789
You ready?

418
00:55:48.333 --> 00:55:52.671
Excuse me.
Gentlemen, we are in need of a car.


419
00:55:56.925 --> 00:56:00.053
Can any of you lovely gentlemen
tell me where...


420
00:56:01.638 --> 00:56:05.642
Only one car in village. 
Juan, the bell maker.

421
00:56:07.102 --> 00:56:09.479
The bell maker.

422
00:56:10.397 --> 00:56:12.482
Thank you.

423
00:56:17.529 --> 00:56:22.576
Bell maker, my ass. That fuselage we slept in
is probably one of Juan's lost shipments.


424
00:56:22.701 --> 00:56:26.371
- You mean he's a drug de...?
- Don't say that word out loud, OK?


425
00:56:26.455 --> 00:56:29.499
- A dope...?
- Come on, let's go.


426
00:56:46.684 --> 00:56:50.146
You hold back. This one, I'll handle.

427
00:57:06.537 --> 00:57:10.667
- What do you want, <i>gringo?</i>
- You speak English? That's great.


428
00:57:10.750 --> 00:57:14.796
We understand that you have a car.
We would like to rent or buy it.


429
00:57:14.879 --> 00:57:17.090
We have to get to a town.

430
00:57:17.173 --> 00:57:20.343
What do you call this
I'm livin' in? A pigsty?

431
00:57:21.427 --> 00:57:23.680
No. This is lovely...

432
00:57:23.763 --> 00:57:27.350
- Hit the road.
- <i>Amigo,</i> you don't understand...


433
00:57:27.475 --> 00:57:30.812
- Hit the road.
<i>- Se√±or,</i> I'd...


434
00:57:36.651 --> 00:57:38.945
It's cool.

435
00:57:39.070 --> 00:57:41.698
It's no problem.

436
00:57:50.665 --> 00:57:53.334
OK, Joan Wilder. 
Write us out of this one.

437
00:57:53.459 --> 00:57:55.294
Joan Wilder?

438
00:57:56.212 --> 00:57:59.215
Joan Wilder? The Joan Wilder?

439
00:58:02.678 --> 00:58:06.265
- You are Joan Wilder, the novelist?
- Yes, I am.


440
00:58:07.099 --> 00:58:11.020
I read your books.
I read all your books. Come in.


441
00:58:11.145 --> 00:58:15.733
<i>This is Juanita Wilder, who writes</i>
<i>the books I read to you on Saturdays.</i>


442
00:58:20.946 --> 00:58:23.240
Come in.

443
00:58:23.324 --> 00:58:26.618
I can't believe you're here. Joan Wilder.

444
00:58:27.786 --> 00:58:30.247
I've been reading your books all these years.

445
00:58:30.372 --> 00:58:33.000
I'm so honoured to have you here.

446
00:58:33.083 --> 00:58:35.252
Welcome to my humble house.

447
00:58:38.464 --> 00:58:42.676
I'm sorry. I haven't introduced myself.
I'm Juan. I live here.


448
00:58:45.429 --> 00:58:49.600
The greatest novelist. 
Get the door, please.

449
00:59:44.197 --> 00:59:47.242
Come in. Make yourself at home.

450
00:59:47.325 --> 00:59:49.703
- Ever read <i>The Return of Angelina?</i>
- No.


451
00:59:49.828 --> 00:59:52.288
That woman makes me hungry.

452
00:59:53.331 --> 00:59:56.751
- How about <i>Love's Wicked Kiss?</i>
- I haven't read that either.


453
00:59:56.876 --> 01:00:00.005
Take it. I have many copies.
I have here <i>The Ravagers</i>


454
01:00:00.088 --> 01:00:02.882
and I am waiting for
<i>Angelina's Savage Secret.</i>


455
01:00:02.966 --> 01:00:08.388
I am so glad you're here in Colombia. I want
to show you all around my beautiful village.


456
01:00:08.471 --> 01:00:13.268
We have colourful tile roofs, typical
cobblestone streets, and very rich fields.


457
01:00:13.351 --> 01:00:18.064
- I was born here, and so was my poor family.
- What I really want is a phone.


458
01:00:18.148 --> 01:00:21.901
No phones. I hate phones.
I don't have a phone.


459
01:00:21.985 --> 01:00:24.529
But have a drink. 
Let's hang out.

460
01:00:24.654 --> 01:00:26.239
Look.

461
01:00:26.323 --> 01:00:29.284
Like it? I can be
in one of your books.

462
01:00:29.367 --> 01:00:32.787
Oh, your drink. 
I got Southern Comfort.

463
01:00:32.912 --> 01:00:39.502
Or Michelob, Kirin, Becks, Dos Equis,
Perrier, Anchor Steam, Doctor Brown...


464
01:00:39.586 --> 01:00:42.840
- How about a Xerox machine?
- Yes, but she is broken.


465
01:00:47.928 --> 01:00:52.016
- Where is the nearest phone?
- Many miles from here.


466
01:00:52.099 --> 01:00:55.728
- Can we get there in your car?
- Who told you I had a car?


467
01:00:55.811 --> 01:00:57.897
The men in the village.

468
01:00:57.980 --> 01:01:00.858
They told you I had a car?
They're such comedians.


469
01:01:00.941 --> 01:01:03.486
They meant my little mule, Pepe.

470
01:01:16.290 --> 01:01:18.376
Not bad for a little mule, eh?

471
01:01:21.337 --> 01:01:23.881
Now Pepe's warming up.

472
01:01:27.802 --> 01:01:31.639
- What are we stopping for?
- I can't hurt my favourite pig.


473
01:01:45.820 --> 01:01:47.905
Look out!

474
01:01:55.579 --> 01:01:59.125
See over there by the fence?
That's where my mother was born.


475
01:01:59.208 --> 01:02:03.130
See that tree? The third tree up the ridge?
My brother planted that tree.


476
01:02:10.387 --> 01:02:13.140
OK, Pepe, let's lose 'em.

477
01:02:21.857 --> 01:02:24.609
- This guy's crazier than I am.
<i>- Gracias.</i> Yeah.


478
01:02:51.511 --> 01:02:56.725
- What the hell ya doin'? That field was cover.
- I wanted to show you this other field.


479
01:03:00.687 --> 01:03:03.940
This guy who's following you,
he's very persistent.


480
01:03:22.042 --> 01:03:25.463
No problem. My little mule is fireproof.

481
01:03:31.761 --> 01:03:34.889
- See that river?
- The one without the bridge?


482
01:03:36.182 --> 01:03:40.770
- It is the water supply for many villages.
- What do you mean, without the bridge?


483
01:03:40.853 --> 01:03:44.440
- It feeds into the Amazon.
- The one without the bridge.


484
01:03:44.524 --> 01:03:49.153
- Where the hell you going?
- Lupe's Escape. I used it often in the past.


485
01:04:29.819 --> 01:04:31.946
You're OK now.

486
01:04:32.071 --> 01:04:35.450
You need little mule to use Lupe's Escape.

487
01:04:35.533 --> 01:04:39.704
That river is impossible to cross
for 200 miles in either direction.


488
01:04:40.747 --> 01:04:46.670
In fact, over that mountain
the river becomes wild. <i>Muy peligroso.</i>


489
01:04:46.754 --> 01:04:48.964
Waterfalls, rapids.

490
01:04:49.840 --> 01:04:52.217
Angelina country. Right, Joan?

491
01:04:52.301 --> 01:04:55.179
Whatever happened to Lupe?

492
01:04:55.804 --> 01:04:58.891
- Terrible disappointment to family.
- I can imagine.


493
01:04:58.974 --> 01:05:02.186
He entered the priesthood.
So I took over the business.


494
01:05:02.269 --> 01:05:04.480
Is for the best. 
I'm not so reckless.

495
01:05:04.563 --> 01:05:07.858
He might have ended up hanging
from <i>El Tenedor del Diablo</i> there.


496
01:05:07.941 --> 01:05:11.236
- It used to happen to <i>bandidos.</i>
<i>- El Tenedor del Diablo?</i>


497
01:05:15.199 --> 01:05:18.035
Hey, let's hit it. 
We're on a roll.

498
01:05:18.118 --> 01:05:22.873
I'm sorry I cannot take you to Cartagena.
Beyond this town I am a wanted man.


499
01:05:22.956 --> 01:05:26.210
But the bus will
take you in the morning.

500
01:05:35.094 --> 01:05:38.180
Of all the things
you can say to me right now,


501
01:05:38.263 --> 01:05:43.477
"I've lost her", Ralph, is gonna get
the most teeth broken in your mouth.


502
01:05:43.602 --> 01:05:47.356
If they're hiking through the jungle,
there's nothin' I can do about it.


503
01:05:47.481 --> 01:05:50.275
I have a car. I am not Tarzan.

504
01:05:50.359 --> 01:05:54.947
I have been through every one-horse shithole
for a 200-mile radius.


505
01:05:55.906 --> 01:05:59.118
You shoulda seen the river
I had to traverse this morning.


506
01:05:59.201 --> 01:06:02.121
So don't give me any of your crap,
you gutless wonder.


507
01:06:02.204 --> 01:06:06.626
You have been an embarrassment to me and
the whole family ever since you were born.


508
01:06:06.710 --> 01:06:09.379
And one more thing, Ira...

509
01:06:10.672 --> 01:06:15.010
You are the luckiest son of a bitch that
walked the face of the earth. She's here.


510
01:06:15.719 --> 01:06:18.680
- She's there?
- She's right here.


511
01:06:19.848 --> 01:06:22.642
She's coming right toward the phone booth.

512
01:06:23.435 --> 01:06:25.562
She's with some guy.

513
01:06:25.645 --> 01:06:29.774
How do I know? She likes guys.
So do you, <i>maric√≥n.</i>


514
01:06:43.621 --> 01:06:49.586
- Yeah, all the rooms have baths.
- That's great. You speak English too.


515
01:06:50.962 --> 01:06:54.799
You wouldn't have a Xerox machine
around here, would ya?


516
01:06:54.924 --> 01:06:58.053
Yeah. We have one in the back.

517
01:06:58.970 --> 01:07:02.265
And it's big enough to take map size?

518
01:07:02.349 --> 01:07:04.434
Yeah. Complete.

519
01:07:05.560 --> 01:07:08.313
Yes, I understand. I'll do that.

520
01:07:12.442 --> 01:07:16.738
Elaine is all right.
They'll wait for me to take the bus tomorrow.


521
01:07:16.821 --> 01:07:22.369
- That's great. Slide, man. You're covered.
- I don't know. He sounded so smug.


522
01:07:22.452 --> 01:07:24.621
- Who?
- That bastard that's got Elaine.


523
01:07:24.705 --> 01:07:27.750
Sure he is.
You're bringing him what he wants - the map.


524
01:07:28.709 --> 01:07:30.795
Yeah.

525
01:07:32.546 --> 01:07:36.384
Well, I guess this is it.

526
01:07:39.845 --> 01:07:41.931
I guess so.

527
01:07:44.266 --> 01:07:48.604
- $375. That was the contract, right?
- Yeah. That was it.


528
01:07:56.529 --> 01:08:00.574
The least I can do is buy you dinner.
Looks like it's gonna be a helluva party.


529
01:08:00.658 --> 01:08:02.827
I'd like that.

530
01:08:02.910 --> 01:08:05.037
Listen, I got a room in the hotel.

531
01:08:05.121 --> 01:08:08.708
Why don't you go get cleaned up?
I'll buy us some new rags.


532
01:08:08.791 --> 01:08:12.420
- Number seven.
- Seven? That's my lucky number.


533
01:08:14.547 --> 01:08:16.007
Mine too.

534
01:08:53.128 --> 01:08:55.964
It's just beautiful.

535
01:08:56.048 --> 01:08:58.091
Thank you, Jack.

536
01:09:14.191 --> 01:09:17.402
I think your writing's hot. It's great.

537
01:09:17.486 --> 01:09:20.489
I mean it. I'm tellin'
ya, I'm impressed. I am.

538
01:09:20.989 --> 01:09:25.494
- You've never even read the book.
- I know.


539
01:09:26.244 --> 01:09:28.622
I suppose...

540
01:09:28.705 --> 01:09:32.084
it's my way of living in another age.

541
01:09:32.167 --> 01:09:35.295
If you did that, 
I never would have met you.

542
01:09:37.214 --> 01:09:39.675
I got you something.

543
01:09:48.558 --> 01:09:50.852
<i>El Coraz√≥n?</i>

544
01:10:17.755 --> 01:10:20.842
- Let's dance.
- I can't.


545
01:10:20.925 --> 01:10:23.219
I'll show you.

546
01:11:10.808 --> 01:11:13.269
I lost my <i>langostino.</i>

547
01:12:49.284 --> 01:12:51.661
Someday, if I had the money,

548
01:12:51.786 --> 01:12:56.499
I'd take you and sail away.

549
01:12:56.583 --> 01:12:58.710
Just the two of us.

550
01:12:59.627 --> 01:13:02.422
Around the world and back again.

551
01:13:05.342 --> 01:13:08.928
I promise you we'd do that.

552
01:13:17.437 --> 01:13:20.899
Why haven't you taken
the map away from me?


553
01:13:23.818 --> 01:13:25.904
What are you talking about?

554
01:13:27.030 --> 01:13:30.617
I saw that tree today,
the Devil's Fork, that's on the map.


555
01:13:31.493 --> 01:13:36.289
- You know how close we are?
- Sure, but what's that got to do with it?


556
01:13:36.373 --> 01:13:40.126
I was thinking about what you said,
about having more to bargain with.


557
01:13:40.251 --> 01:13:43.338
Yeah. Your best way to help Elaine
is to get that treasure.


558
01:13:43.421 --> 01:13:47.092
Then you could waltz into Cartagena.
You're holding all the cards.


559
01:13:49.260 --> 01:13:52.097
I'd love to see you on that boat.

560
01:13:53.682 --> 01:13:57.435
But, Jack, if we have to give it up
to save Elaine...


561
01:13:57.560 --> 01:13:59.813
Then we give it up. 
It's your sister.

562
01:13:59.896 --> 01:14:04.192
Hell, yeah. Of course we give it up.
But at least we've got the leverage to do it.


563
01:14:15.746 --> 01:14:17.957
Let's go for it.

564
01:15:11.218 --> 01:15:13.679
He just won't quit.

565
01:15:28.612 --> 01:15:31.406
- What are you doing?
- I'm hot-wiring the car.


566
01:15:31.531 --> 01:15:33.825
Try the key.

567
01:16:02.145 --> 01:16:04.856
There it is. That's the shrine.

568
01:16:04.940 --> 01:16:06.900
Let's go.

569
01:16:37.472 --> 01:16:40.517
This can't be all.
There's gotta be another clue.


570
01:16:40.600 --> 01:16:45.605
Well, landmarks change, things grow.
All that stuff, you know.


571
01:16:48.650 --> 01:16:50.737
You hear that?

572
01:16:51.696 --> 01:16:53.781
Waterfall.

573
01:16:53.865 --> 01:16:55.950
Look, Jack.

574
01:16:58.119 --> 01:16:59.203
All right!

575
01:17:20.767 --> 01:17:23.227
- You all right?
- Yeah.


576
01:17:27.690 --> 01:17:30.151
This has got to be it.

577
01:17:32.070 --> 01:17:36.074
What does <i>Leche de la Madre</i> mean?

578
01:17:37.492 --> 01:17:41.329
<i>- Leche de la Madre?</i>
- Yeah. It's on the map.


579
01:17:42.705 --> 01:17:44.791
It means "mother's milk".

580
01:17:44.874 --> 01:17:46.959
Mother's milk?

581
01:18:02.475 --> 01:18:04.560
I'll be goddamned.

582
01:18:05.937 --> 01:18:08.064
Mama, I'm home.

583
01:18:14.196 --> 01:18:17.074
- I can't believe I'm doing this.
- What?


584
01:18:17.866 --> 01:18:20.869
Digging for treasure with you.

585
01:18:22.705 --> 01:18:25.165
Jack?

586
01:18:25.290 --> 01:18:27.668
Yeah?

587
01:18:27.793 --> 01:18:30.921
You're the best time I've ever had.

588
01:18:34.008 --> 01:18:37.845
Never been anybody's best time before.

589
01:19:12.671 --> 01:19:14.923
It's a priceless statue.

590
01:19:20.137 --> 01:19:23.307
Somebody out there's got
a really sick sense of humour.


591
01:19:23.390 --> 01:19:27.478
Wait a minute.
My first book, <i>Treasures of Lust,</i>


592
01:19:27.561 --> 01:19:30.690
I hid the treasure inside the statue.

593
01:19:52.962 --> 01:19:56.091
Jesus Christ, we're in a lot of trouble.

594
01:19:57.217 --> 01:20:00.345
Understatement of the year, asshole.

595
01:20:02.013 --> 01:20:05.141
Is there anybody who isn't following you?

596
01:20:06.184 --> 01:20:09.312
Put the goods in the bag.

597
01:20:13.733 --> 01:20:15.986
Now move it, before Batman comes home.

598
01:20:16.069 --> 01:20:19.489
It's time I had a chauffeur, Miss Wilder.

599
01:20:20.407 --> 01:20:25.912
- Back off me, creep. Just back off.
- Oh, I'm the creep, huh? At least I'm honest.


600
01:20:25.996 --> 01:20:30.083
I'm stealin' this stone. I'm not tryin'
to romance it out from under her.


601
01:20:30.417 --> 01:20:33.920
Wait a minute.
Going for the stone was my idea.


602
01:20:35.338 --> 01:20:38.508
That's what all the good
con artists want you to think.


603
01:20:38.591 --> 01:20:40.885
He made you think
you needed it, you sap.

604
01:20:40.969 --> 01:20:44.306
Get in and drive. Move it.

605
01:20:47.350 --> 01:20:49.436
Move it.

606
01:20:49.728 --> 01:20:52.398
See how you like being stuck in...

607
01:20:52.481 --> 01:20:54.567
Holy shit!

608
01:20:58.070 --> 01:20:59.947
Get in.

609
01:21:03.826 --> 01:21:06.370
- Which way do we go?
- Follow that stone.


610
01:21:23.846 --> 01:21:26.057
Mounties!

611
01:21:35.566 --> 01:21:37.652
Hit it.

612
01:21:59.382 --> 01:22:02.510
- Where the hell are you goin'?
- Where am I goin'?


613
01:22:03.928 --> 01:22:07.181
How about Lupe's Escape?

614
01:22:26.827 --> 01:22:30.122
Where you goin'? Quit steering.
You're not going anywhere.


615
01:22:40.298 --> 01:22:43.093
What are we gonna do now?

616
01:22:43.176 --> 01:22:45.262
Jump.

617
01:23:18.503 --> 01:23:21.923
Joan Wilder! What a comeback!

618
01:23:25.510 --> 01:23:27.596
Man, I thought you drowned.

619
01:23:27.679 --> 01:23:29.765
I did.

620
01:23:30.390 --> 01:23:33.561
- You OK?
- Sure.


621
01:23:33.645 --> 01:23:36.606
I'm great. I'm fine.

622
01:23:36.689 --> 01:23:38.775
Only you're on that side.

623
01:23:39.567 --> 01:23:43.321
- There's no way across this sucker.
- You did this on purpose.


624
01:23:43.446 --> 01:23:46.616
What the hell you talkin' about?
We went over a waterfall.


625
01:23:46.699 --> 01:23:51.746
Admit it. You planned this all along.
I knew I couldn't depend on you.


626
01:23:56.250 --> 01:23:58.544
What's the name of that hotel in Cartagena?

627
01:23:58.753 --> 01:24:01.673
Hotel Cartagena. 
What do you care?

628
01:24:01.756 --> 01:24:07.804
All right. Now you just head towards the
sunset and you'll make it. And I'll be there.


629
01:24:07.887 --> 01:24:12.892
Yeah, sure. With <i>El Coraz√≥n</i>
in your pocket. What about my sister?


630
01:24:12.976 --> 01:24:16.396
Well, they don't have to know about this.

631
01:24:16.521 --> 01:24:19.565
- You got the map.
- Well, you've got the stone.


632
01:24:26.072 --> 01:24:29.117
I'll meet you there. Trust me.

633
01:24:29.200 --> 01:24:30.994
What?

634
01:25:10.701 --> 01:25:13.245
So you made it finally.

635
01:25:14.496 --> 01:25:18.334
- Got the map?
- Yes. I brought it. I want to talk to Elaine.


636
01:25:18.459 --> 01:25:22.212
No, you can't talk to
her till I get it.

637
01:25:22.296 --> 01:25:24.381
Look out your window.

638
01:25:25.382 --> 01:25:29.303
<i>See the fort across the bay? 
The tower?</i>

639
01:25:29.386 --> 01:25:32.890
You take a water
taxi right outside your hotel.

640
01:25:32.973 --> 01:25:36.143
You meet me there in two hours,

641
01:25:36.226 --> 01:25:38.395
all by yourself.

642
01:25:57.206 --> 01:26:01.585
- Has Jack Colton checked in?
- <i>In the last two minutes, no.</i>


643
01:27:22.709 --> 01:27:24.794
Over here.

644
01:27:35.514 --> 01:27:37.600
Stop right there.

645
01:27:38.517 --> 01:27:41.687
- Let me see the map.
- Where are you?


646
01:27:41.771 --> 01:27:46.275
- Let me see the map.
- Let me see Elaine.


647
01:27:48.361 --> 01:27:50.446
Joanie?

648
01:28:00.289 --> 01:28:03.417
Drop the map and back off.

649
01:28:12.301 --> 01:28:14.845
If this isn't genuine...

650
01:28:17.348 --> 01:28:20.309
If you've pulled a fast one...

651
01:28:37.368 --> 01:28:39.453
Joan Wilder,

652
01:28:39.537 --> 01:28:42.915
you and your sister...

653
01:28:44.709 --> 01:28:46.419
can go.

654
01:28:52.967 --> 01:28:55.053
It's OK.

655
01:29:06.398 --> 01:29:09.276
I missed you at the hotel.

656
01:29:13.488 --> 01:29:15.574
We all did.

657
01:29:24.958 --> 01:29:27.919
You brainless broad.
You let him follow you here.


658
01:29:34.301 --> 01:29:36.553
This map is nothing.

659
01:29:36.636 --> 01:29:39.097
They already have the stone.

660
01:29:44.019 --> 01:29:47.064
I had it in my hands, Ira.

661
01:29:47.147 --> 01:29:51.485
These hands that are gonna break
every bone in your body.


662
01:29:55.989 --> 01:29:58.075
Later.

663
01:30:09.044 --> 01:30:11.755
Where is it?

664
01:30:11.838 --> 01:30:14.383
I don't know.

665
01:30:14.466 --> 01:30:18.221
- Where is the stone?
- I don't...


666
01:30:21.933 --> 01:30:25.061
We dug. We didn't find anything.

667
01:30:57.093 --> 01:30:59.929
Crocodiles shed tears
when they eat their prey.


668
01:31:00.013 --> 01:31:02.849
You have heard of
these tears, I am sure.

669
01:31:02.932 --> 01:31:05.727
But have you seen them?

670
01:31:07.186 --> 01:31:08.813
Stop it!

671
01:31:27.540 --> 01:31:30.418
Look at those snappers.

672
01:31:31.836 --> 01:31:36.216
You can forego this agony.
Simply tell me, where is <i>El Coraz√≥n?</i>


673
01:31:36.300 --> 01:31:39.970
Where is the heart? 
Where is the stone?

674
01:31:40.095 --> 01:31:42.639
All right. Just let her go, will ya?

675
01:31:42.765 --> 01:31:46.810
- She doesn't know where it is. I've got it.
- Where is it?


676
01:31:51.315 --> 01:31:54.276
- In a safe place.
- Where is it?


677
01:31:59.114 --> 01:32:01.200
Where is it?

678
01:32:42.825 --> 01:32:43.909
Choke on it.

679
01:32:56.506 --> 01:32:57.507
Thank you.

680
01:33:10.603 --> 01:33:12.480
Get down!

681
01:33:28.288 --> 01:33:30.248
Come on.

682
01:33:53.772 --> 01:33:55.273
Hurry.

683
01:33:59.152 --> 01:34:02.530
All right, <i>muchachos.</i> Bring the boat around!

684
01:34:02.614 --> 01:34:06.993
Hold them down! 
Let me get to the boat!

685
01:34:43.406 --> 01:34:45.324
Just a little more.

686
01:35:04.760 --> 01:35:06.429
Ira!

687
01:35:08.556 --> 01:35:12.059
- Come back here, Ira.
- Jump, Ralph.


688
01:35:12.143 --> 01:35:16.272
- I can't swim. You know that, Ira.
- I'll come back for you.


689
01:35:16.355 --> 01:35:20.026
- You promise?
- I'll send the boat back for you, Ralph.


690
01:35:20.109 --> 01:35:22.069
- When?
- Soon.


691
01:35:22.153 --> 01:35:25.656
- How soon?
- Very soon.


692
01:35:32.371 --> 01:35:34.165
No!

693
01:35:39.755 --> 01:35:43.508
Where do you think you're going, pal?
Come on. Cough it up.


694
01:35:43.967 --> 01:35:45.886
Wait.

695
01:35:51.308 --> 01:35:53.393
Joanie?

696
01:35:56.063 --> 01:35:59.066
How will you die, Joan Wilder?

697
01:35:59.149 --> 01:36:02.778
Slow like a snail?

698
01:36:03.779 --> 01:36:06.406
Or fast like a shooting star?

699
01:36:41.400 --> 01:36:43.151
Jack!

700
01:36:59.961 --> 01:37:03.089
Come on, you bastard. 
Give me a break.

701
01:37:11.305 --> 01:37:12.849
Damn it.

702
01:38:31.303 --> 01:38:32.846
Jack.

703
01:38:36.016 --> 01:38:38.060
It's OK.

704
01:38:38.143 --> 01:38:39.979
Come on back, Ira.

705
01:38:40.062 --> 01:38:42.773
You're my cousin, Ira. 
Don't you remember?

706
01:38:42.856 --> 01:38:46.110
Your mother, my mother.

707
01:38:47.444 --> 01:38:50.322
That way. He's gettin' away.

708
01:38:50.864 --> 01:38:53.200
He's got it all. Go that way.

709
01:38:53.575 --> 01:38:55.160
Joanie?

710
01:38:55.244 --> 01:38:59.665
OK. Here's what we gotta do. Get to
the American consulate. Tell 'em everything.


711
01:38:59.748 --> 01:39:02.626
- Where are you going?
- They might even believe you.


712
01:39:02.710 --> 01:39:06.547
Don't mention my name.
Cartagena cops and I go way back.


713
01:39:06.630 --> 01:39:11.468
- Elaine, it's been a pleasure.
- You're leaving? You're leaving me?


714
01:39:24.523 --> 01:39:27.568
You're gonna be all right, Joan Wilder.

715
01:39:45.754 --> 01:39:47.839
You always were.

716
01:39:56.931 --> 01:39:59.017
Jack Colton!

717
01:40:06.358 --> 01:40:08.443
Damn.

718
01:40:31.049 --> 01:40:34.302
Well, that is far
and away your best book.

719
01:40:34.386 --> 01:40:37.347
I can't believe how
fast you cranked this out.

720
01:40:37.430 --> 01:40:41.184
- So you really like it?
- Like it? Look at me. I'm a mess.


721
01:40:41.267 --> 01:40:44.521
It made me cry.
Don't tell anybody or I'll cut your heart out.


722
01:40:44.604 --> 01:40:47.357
I love the end where he
dives in and swims away.


723
01:40:47.440 --> 01:40:52.737
Then he meets her at the airport.
They sail off around the world together.


724
01:40:52.821 --> 01:40:56.032
God, I can't believe
how this got to me.

725
01:40:56.116 --> 01:40:59.662
Well, I was inspired.

726
01:40:59.745 --> 01:41:04.417
Joanie, you are now
a world-class hopeless romantic.


727
01:41:04.500 --> 01:41:07.169
No. Hopeful.

728
01:41:11.716 --> 01:41:13.801
Hopeful romantic.

729
01:41:19.140 --> 01:41:21.225
No, thank you.

730
01:41:22.476 --> 01:41:24.562
Never wear 'em.

731
01:42:12.693 --> 01:42:14.779
I like your boots.

732
01:42:14.862 --> 01:42:19.659
That poor old yellow-tailed guy
developed a fatal case of indigestion.


733
01:42:19.743 --> 01:42:22.120
Died right in my arms.

734
01:42:22.245 --> 01:42:26.667
I can't blame him. If I were to die,
there's nowhere else on earth I'd rather be.


735
01:42:26.958 --> 01:42:31.588
I couldn't stop thinking about you.
I even read one of your books.


736
01:42:32.756 --> 01:42:35.801
Then you know how they all end.
