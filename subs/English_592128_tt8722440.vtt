[man on TV] Police raid an organized
crime meeting at a home in Apalachin,

where an estimated 100 mob
members are rumored to be present.

00:00:38.222 --> 00:00:40.956
Rumors about this day have
been passed down for decades,

4
00:00:40.958 --> 00:00:43.192
but how much of that information is true?

5
00:00:43.194 --> 00:00:44.927
On this day, was Apalachin, New York,

6
00:00:44.929 --> 00:00:47.162
the center of the organized crime world?

Can I see your license and registration, please?

41
00:03:47.711 --> 00:03:50.345
Joseph Palermo? Yeah.

42
00:03:51.949 --> 00:03:55.817
It says here you're 5'11", 155 pounds.

43
00:03:55.819 --> 00:03:58.153
Yeah, and? And you're not.

44
00:04:01.125 --> 00:04:03.792
Are you Joseph Palermo?

45
00:04:03.794 --> 00:04:06.061
Yeah.

46
00:04:06.063 --> 00:04:07.929
I really gotta be on my way, officer.

47
00:04:07.931 --> 00:04:10.132
Is there any way we could, um,

48
00:04:10.134 --> 00:04:12.501
take care of this
between the two of us?

49
00:04:14.938 --> 00:04:16.905
That's a lot of money.

50
00:04:16.907 --> 00:04:18.807
Sure would go a long way,

51
00:04:18.809 --> 00:04:21.943
but it's not worth my badge.

52
00:04:21.945 --> 00:04:25.247
Now, if you were to offer
me this car, on the other hand...

Excuse me?

54
00:04:26.917 --> 00:04:29.184
I'm just sayin', if you
were to offer me this car,

55
00:04:29.186 --> 00:04:32.521
I'd actually consider it.

56
00:04:32.523 --> 00:04:35.691
Like I said, maybe we could take
care of it between the two of us.

Are you Joseph Palermo?

58

Yeah, I said that.

59
00:04:41.799 --> 00:04:43.999
I'm gonna need you
to step outside the car.

60
00:04:47.805 --> 00:04:50.038
Don't make any sudden moves.

61

Put your hands on the car.

These are some very serious charges.

00:05:26.076 --> 00:05:28.276
All right. So be it.

70
00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:33.215
Make yourself comfortable, but not that comfortable.

[rings] Hello?

00:05:35.419 --> 00:05:37.352
Hey, Margie.

73
00:05:37.354 --> 00:05:39.554
Yeah, that's what I thought.

74
00:05:39.556 --> 00:05:41.323
Thanks so much. 
You're a peach.

75
00:05:51.902 --> 00:05:55.704
What's your association with Mr. Barbara?

76
00:05:55.706 --> 00:05:58.340
Who? Mr. Joseph Barbara?

77
00:05:58.342 --> 00:06:00.275
Never heard of him.

78
00:06:00.277 --> 00:06:03.011
Really? That's odd. 
Because according to the High Way Inn,

79
00:06:03.013 --> 00:06:06.748
Mr. Barbara is responsible for
taking care of your lodging.

80
00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:10.886
Oh, that Mr. Barbara. 
I'm one of his distributors.

81
00:06:10.888 --> 00:06:14.523
And you drove all the way up here
from New York City, just to meet a client?

82
00:06:18.562 --> 00:06:21.463
Well, at least you're talkin'. 
Here, you can have that back.

The '55. Chevy Bel Air?

Oh. That V8 is pretty solid, right?

88
00:06:40.951 --> 00:06:43.585
Most people like the Rocket 88,

89
00:06:43.587 --> 00:06:48.290
but honestly, I prefer
a slightly smaller engine block.

00:06:48.292 --> 00:06:53.295
I mean, 265-cubic-square-inch overhead-valve V8?

Oh! [whistles]

goin' when you need it, right?

Am I right?

94
00:07:02.439 --> 00:07:05.307
I shoulda gone into the soda pop business.

How long have you worked for Joseph Barbara?

96
00:07:11.615 --> 00:07:13.482
You're makin' a big mistake, pal.

97
00:07:13.484 --> 00:07:16.084
Yeah? How so? [knock at door]

98
00:07:17.154 --> 00:07:19.488
Officer Croswell.

99
00:07:21.758 --> 00:07:23.492
Sergeant Croswell. Who are you?

100
00:07:23.494 --> 00:07:27.429
Who am I? I'm Irving Boseman, Esquire.

101
00:07:27.431 --> 00:07:30.832
And you know what I got here? 
I got a writ of habeas corpus

102
00:07:30.834 --> 00:07:33.768
from Judge Etkin in Binghamton!

103
00:07:33.770 --> 00:07:35.537
For who? For who?

104
00:07:36.373 --> 00:07:38.006
Mr. Carmine Galante,

105
00:07:38.008 --> 00:07:40.842
who you are holding here without any charges.

106
00:07:40.844 --> 00:07:44.946
Oh, there's charges, counselor. 
Serious charges.

107

Why don't you read
that, Sergeant? Open it up.

110
00:07:52.456 --> 00:07:55.056
Did you go to
school for habeas corpus yet?

111
00:07:55.058 --> 00:07:57.158
Or were you chasin' deer around this county?

112
00:07:57.160 --> 00:08:00.795
Judge Etkin? He's not even from our county.

113
00:08:00.797 --> 00:08:03.331
Excuse me. State of New York Supreme Court.

114
00:08:03.333 --> 00:08:05.333
This is New York, right, Sergeant?

115
00:08:05.335 --> 00:08:07.202
You gotta be kiddin' me. [door opens]

116
00:08:07.204 --> 00:08:10.505
What's all the noise out here? Hey, 
Lieutenant, how you doin'?

117
00:08:10.507 --> 00:08:14.409
I'm just here with my client. 
Uh, he's being released now, habeas corpus.

118
00:08:14.411 --> 00:08:16.711
I don't know what the Sergeant's problem is. 
Just take the cuffs off.

119
00:08:16.713 --> 00:08:18.980
Everything in order, Croswell? 
There's no problem, sir.

120
00:08:18.982 --> 00:08:22.751
[Irving] Take the cuffs off him, okay? 
There's no more charges, all right?

121
00:08:23.854 --> 00:08:26.221
Looks like it's your lucky day, Mr. Galante.

122
00:08:26.223 --> 00:08:28.723
Make sure you take your money, your keys.

123
00:08:31.361 --> 00:08:35.530
It's Galante. Ga-lan-tay.

124
00:08:35.532 --> 00:08:38.833
[spits] Puttana. 
I needed those shined anyway.

125
00:08:38.835 --> 00:08:41.736
Thank you, Sergeant, park ranger, whatever you are.

126
00:08:41.738 --> 00:08:43.638
Go chase some squirrels. 
Have a good day.

127
00:08:44.841 --> 00:08:47.442
Yes, sir, Mr. Esquire. [door closes]

128
00:08:52.883 --> 00:08:55.383
I can't believe this. 
It's the Supreme Court of New York.

129
00:08:55.385 --> 00:08:57.752
I thought we're supposed to
be on the same team.

130
00:09:05.596 --> 00:09:07.696
Ed, always workin', huh?

131
00:09:07.698 --> 00:09:09.564
What do you got here?

132
00:09:09.566 --> 00:09:12.467
He was visiting Joe Barbara.
The soda guy? So what?

133
00:09:12.469 --> 00:09:14.603
Wake up and smell the coffee, Vince.

134
00:09:14.605 --> 00:09:16.605
I am. That's why I'm drinkin' it.

135
00:09:16.607 --> 00:09:20.809
Joe Barbara represents everything that is bad.

136
00:09:20.811 --> 00:09:23.612
I mean, he-he fronts this beverage company,

137
00:09:23.614 --> 00:09:25.313
but...

138
00:09:25.315 --> 00:09:27.716
I think he's connected to the Scranton mob.

139
00:09:27.718 --> 00:09:30.251
There's a mob in Scranton? Come on, Ed.

140
00:09:30.253 --> 00:09:31.720
I'm tellin' you.

141
00:09:32.956 --> 00:09:35.156
Got my first collar in Scranton. Yeah?

142
00:09:35.158 --> 00:09:38.627
I pulled Barbara over in 1942.

143
00:09:38.629 --> 00:09:41.296
He was drivin' a Cadillac Fleetwood,

144
00:09:41.298 --> 00:09:43.498
flathead V8.

145
00:09:43.500 --> 00:09:46.234
I got him for
the illegal sale of gasoline.

146
00:09:46.236 --> 00:09:48.169
A war rations violation.

147
00:09:48.171 --> 00:09:51.272
Ed, how is it that you remember
arrests that you made 15 years ago?

148
00:09:51.274 --> 00:09:53.141
You got some mind on you, my friend.

149
00:09:53.143 --> 00:09:55.543
Because he's the reason why
I'm stuck in this shit-hole town.

150
00:09:57.648 --> 00:10:00.115
Sorry. I didn't mean it
like that. No, I know. Hey.

151
00:10:00.117 --> 00:10:03.351
He gets released, and I mysteriously get reassigned.

152
00:10:03.353 --> 00:10:05.820
And you think Barbara had
somethin' to do with it? Yeah.

153
00:10:05.822 --> 00:10:09.190
They own politicians, they
own judges, they own cops.

154
00:10:09.192 --> 00:10:11.826
Wait, who's "they"? The Mafia, Vince.

155
00:10:11.828 --> 00:10:14.496
Well, yeah, I know, I know. All right.

156
00:10:14.498 --> 00:10:15.997
Good stuff, Sarge.

157
00:10:15.999 --> 00:10:17.866
Let me know if you need anything.

158
00:10:29.212 --> 00:10:31.579
This fuckin' Anastasia.

159
00:10:33.383 --> 00:10:36.317
Vincent, I thought I told

Same as last time. 
Told me to go fuck myself. 
Pardon my language.

a top New York City kingpin,

183
00:12:40.076 --> 00:12:41.976
was shot last night as he returned home

184
00:12:41.978 --> 00:12:45.246
to his swank Central Park West apartment building.

185
00:12:45.248 --> 00:12:46.981
The bullet grazed Costello's ear,

186
00:12:46.983 --> 00:12:49.617
and he was checked in
and out of the hospital.

What was that? "This is for you, Frank."

Costello told the DA he didn't see nobody. 
He's not gonna testify.

00:13:39.369 --> 00:13:41.069
Plus, he's hung up his hat.

He's fine. Okay. 
Thank you so much.

It's my pleasure. Thank you.

320
00:21:01.411 --> 00:21:03.110
I'll figure out how to
get a grate on there,

That'd be great.

Don't start with me.

[car engine revving] [cheering]

475
00:30:54.036 --> 00:30:56.603
[girl 1] You did
it! [girl 2] Go, Billy!

476
00:30:56.605 --> 00:30:58.906
Baby, you did it!

477
00:30:58.908 --> 00:31:00.674
Wow! Well, what was wrong with it?

478
00:31:00.676 --> 00:31:02.876
Uh, it just wasn't gettin' enough air.

479
00:31:02.878 --> 00:31:04.845
Oh. The carburetor.

480
00:31:04.847 --> 00:31:06.713
Oh, okay.

481
00:31:06.715 --> 00:31:09.750
Well, all right, kids. 
Come on, inside now. 
Wash up for supper.

482
00:31:09.752 --> 00:31:11.919
Go ahead, hurry up!

483
00:31:11.921 --> 00:31:14.521
All right, what do I owe you? Really, 
I appreciate it.

484
00:31:14.523 --> 00:31:17.391
Oh, come on. Nothin'. 
It's on the house.

485
00:31:17.393 --> 00:31:19.092
No, no, Ed. Mm.

486
00:31:19.094 --> 00:31:21.361
Are you hungry? 
At least let me feed you.

487
00:31:21.363 --> 00:31:24.231
I should really get goin'. No, 
I'm not gonna take no for an answer.

488
00:31:24.233 --> 00:31:27.034
You just have to clean up a little. 
Let me clean up a little, okay?

489
00:31:27.036 --> 00:31:28.535
Okay, okay.

490
00:31:30.706 --> 00:31:33.140
So, how did you
get so good with cars?

491
00:31:33.142 --> 00:31:35.108
My dad loved cars.

492
00:31:35.110 --> 00:31:38.378
We started rebuilding our first hot
rod when I was ten years old.

493
00:31:38.380 --> 00:31:39.947
What's a hot rod?

494
00:31:39.949 --> 00:31:42.749
Uh, it's a car that
you build from the ground up.

495
00:31:42.751 --> 00:31:46.820
Why don't you just buy one? 
Yeah, why don't you just buy one that's already built?

496
00:31:46.822 --> 00:31:48.956
Excuse me. Why so rude?

497
00:31:48.958 --> 00:31:51.425
No, that's actually a good question.

498
00:31:51.427 --> 00:31:53.060
It's 'cause it's fun.

499
00:31:53.062 --> 00:31:55.329
You know, buildin' somethin'
with your hands. It's like

500
00:31:55.331 --> 00:31:57.631
playin' with wood blocks or Tinker Toys.

501
00:31:57.633 --> 00:32:01.802
We have wooden blocks. You do? 
And don't you like to build stuff with 'em?

502
00:32:01.804 --> 00:32:05.939
Yeah. I built a big castle the other day. 
It was this tall.

503
00:32:05.941 --> 00:32:08.608
[Billy] No, it wasn't. Yes, it was.

504
00:32:08.610 --> 00:32:11.078
I used every single block we had.

505
00:32:11.080 --> 00:32:13.747
Well, that's impressive. 
And it was fun, wasn't it?

506
00:32:14.984 --> 00:32:16.850
Where is it, your hot rod?

507
00:32:16.852 --> 00:32:19.519
Oh, that car? It's long gone.

508
00:32:19.521 --> 00:32:23.023
Oh. Well, you can borrow some
of my blocks if you'd like.

509
00:32:24.360 --> 00:32:27.995
Aw, thanks. That's awfully sweet, June.

510
00:32:27.997 --> 00:32:30.764
I'm done, Mommy. 
Can I be excused?

511
00:32:30.766 --> 00:32:33.633
Yes, but get ready for bed. All right.

512
00:32:33.635 --> 00:32:36.837
I'm done too, Mommy. Yeah, me too.

513
00:32:36.839 --> 00:32:39.339
[Natalie] Remember to brush your teeth. 
Good night, guys.

514
00:32:39.341 --> 00:32:40.707
[Billy] Bye.

515
00:32:47.116 --> 00:32:50.951
So, hot rods, huh?

516
00:32:50.953 --> 00:32:54.354
[chuckles] Yeah. I love cars.

517
00:32:56.692 --> 00:32:58.392
You still close with your folks?

518
00:32:58.394 --> 00:33:00.260
Nah, they're not around anymore.

519
00:33:01.530 --> 00:33:04.131
My dad never made
it back from the war,

520
00:33:04.133 --> 00:33:07.567
and my mom-- let's just say she...

521
00:33:07.569 --> 00:33:09.503
she wasn't good at being alone.

522
00:33:09.505 --> 00:33:11.905
I'm sorry. It's all right.

523
00:33:11.907 --> 00:33:15.342
Well, grief has a
way of lingering, I guess.

524
00:33:15.344 --> 00:33:17.377
Well, for me anyway.

525
00:33:17.379 --> 00:33:19.012
Yeah.

526
00:33:19.014 --> 00:33:21.048
How are you doin' with that?

527
00:33:21.050 --> 00:33:23.750
I'm okay. Yeah.

528
00:33:23.752 --> 00:33:27.087
As long as the kids
are happy, then I'm happy.

529
00:33:30.826 --> 00:33:32.726
You still living in the barracks, Ed?

530
00:33:32.728 --> 00:33:34.528
How did you know
I live in the barracks?

531
00:33:34.530 --> 00:33:36.830
Well, it's a small town, Ed.

532
00:33:36.832 --> 00:33:39.499
Oh, yeah.

533
00:33:39.501 --> 00:33:42.736
Yeah. I like it there. It's-
- It's convenient.

534
00:33:42.738 --> 00:33:45.238
Yeah, convenient. Yeah.

535
00:33:45.240 --> 00:33:47.841
There's not much of a morning commute.

536
00:33:47.843 --> 00:33:49.443
No.

537
00:33:49.445 --> 00:33:51.078
But convenient? What about...

538
00:33:51.080 --> 00:33:53.747
Is it comfortable? 
Don't you miss this?

539
00:33:53.749 --> 00:33:57.717
Well, you know, 
I'm not sure about comfort.

540
00:33:57.719 --> 00:34:00.754
I think it makes you soft. 
I want to be ready.

541
00:34:00.756 --> 00:34:04.091
Just ready, on call if somethin' goes down.

542
00:34:04.093 --> 00:34:07.694
On call. [chuckles] For this little town?

543
00:34:07.696 --> 00:34:11.231
Now, you'd be surprised. 
I'm workin' on a really big case right here.

544
00:34:11.233 --> 00:34:13.366
Probably the biggest thing that's
ever happened in this town.

545
00:34:13.368 --> 00:34:16.436
Really? Well, do tell.

546
00:34:16.438 --> 00:34:18.738
Can't say. It's official police business.

547
00:34:18.740 --> 00:34:23.243
Oh, you with your "official police business."

548
00:34:23.245 --> 00:34:26.713
I have reason to believe that
there is a network of organized crime

549
00:34:26.715 --> 00:34:29.049
running in and out of this area.

550
00:34:29.051 --> 00:34:32.619
What? What does even organized crime mean?

551
00:34:32.621 --> 00:34:33.887
Well...

552
00:34:35.457 --> 00:34:37.557
Right here.

553
00:34:37.559 --> 00:34:40.827
"He died in the chair." What does
this have to do with our little town?

554
00:34:40.829 --> 00:34:44.131
Well, we happen to
have a very significant associate

555
00:34:44.133 --> 00:34:48.135
of a major crime syndicate
living right here in Apalachin.

556
00:34:48.137 --> 00:34:49.669
Mr. Gerimotta.

557
00:34:49.671 --> 00:34:52.639
He lives up the block, 
I knew he was a crook.

558
00:34:56.678 --> 00:34:59.312
Oh... Oh, you're serious, Ed?

559
00:34:59.314 --> 00:35:01.715
I'm dead serious. 
Nobody believes me.

560
00:35:03.185 --> 00:35:04.951
But wait a second.

561
00:35:04.953 --> 00:35:08.588
How did you know Mr. 
Gerimotta was a kingpin?

562
00:35:08.590 --> 00:35:09.990
Oh...

563
00:35:09.992 --> 00:35:12.259
No, but I am serious.

564
00:35:12.261 --> 00:35:14.861
Now, I'm still puttin' the pieces together,

565
00:35:14.863 --> 00:35:16.563
but once I do...

566
00:35:20.035 --> 00:35:23.436
I wanna thank you. This was-
- This was delicious.

567
00:35:23.438 --> 00:35:26.273
I can't tell you the last
time I had a home-cooked meal.

568
00:35:26.275 --> 00:35:29.242
Oh, well, good. 
I'm glad you liked it.

569
00:35:31.113 --> 00:35:33.046
Are you done? I'll take it. Okay. Yeah.

570
00:35:33.048 --> 00:35:35.515
Let me help you. 
Oh, no, not at all. 
You've already done too much.

571
00:35:35.517 --> 00:35:37.150
Come on.

572
00:35:37.152 --> 00:35:39.152
Oh, no. Let me get those, Ed.

573
00:35:39.154 --> 00:35:41.621
Are you sure you don't
need more help? No, no, no.

574
00:35:41.623 --> 00:35:43.657
You've already done so much. Thank you.

575
00:35:43.659 --> 00:35:45.725
Oh, all right. Thank you. 
It was really wonderful.

576
00:35:45.727 --> 00:35:48.028
Oh.

577
00:35:48.030 --> 00:35:51.298
All right, good night. Oh, 
Ed, the kids are upstairs.

578
00:35:51.300 --> 00:35:53.066
Of course. I'm sorry.

579
00:35:53.068 --> 00:35:56.570
No, I don't know what I was thinkin'. Really. 
Oh, it's okay.

580
00:35:56.572 --> 00:35:59.506
Okay, um, I'll see you then.

581
00:35:59.508 --> 00:36:01.775
Thanks-
- Thanks again.

582
00:36:04.846 --> 00:36:07.180
I understand.

583
00:36:07.182 --> 00:36:08.915
Okay. [speaks Italian].

584
00:36:11.753 --> 00:36:14.421
So, how we lookin'?

585
00:36:14.423 --> 00:36:16.489
Everyone so far is very honored,

586
00:36:16.491 --> 00:36:18.658
looking forward to sitting down with you.

587
00:36:19.761 --> 00:36:22.195
Good. How many we got so far?

588
00:36:22.197 --> 00:36:23.863
Thirty-six confirmed,

589
00:36:23.865 --> 00:36:26.600
still another... at least another 20 to go.

590
00:36:27.703 --> 00:36:29.936
You better call Joe the Barber back.

591
00:36:29.938 --> 00:36:32.138
Tell him he's gonna
need a lot of ice.

[music stops]

594
00:37:05.874 --> 00:37:07.140
Hello, Joe.

595
00:37:08.810 --> 00:37:11.711
How you doin'? 
I'm good, how you doin'? Listen.

596
00:37:11.713 --> 00:37:15.582
I'm havin' a few people over at the house next week. 
I need some fuckin' fish.

597
00:37:15.584 --> 00:37:17.817
How many people you talkin'? 
Twenty, 30 people.

598
00:37:17.819 --> 00:37:19.619
Joe, that's a lot of people.

599
00:37:19.621 --> 00:37:21.655
I have all my top salespeople coming.

600
00:37:21.657 --> 00:37:25.091
Oh, you call them salesmen. 
[chuckles] I'm sorry. I was kidding. Uh--

601
00:37:25.093 --> 00:37:28.395
Uh, cod. We'll get some cod.

602
00:37:28.397 --> 00:37:29.996
Code? Yeah, cod.

603
00:37:29.998 --> 00:37:32.265
You don't want the cod, Joe. 
Why don't I want cod?

604
00:37:32.267 --> 00:37:34.768
[sighs] It's a beautiful fish.

605
00:37:34.770 --> 00:37:37.737
But it's not good for the grill. It's too soft. 
It's gonna fall apart.

606
00:37:37.739 --> 00:37:39.506
You know what? 
I didn't think about that. Yeah.

607
00:37:39.508 --> 00:37:42.008
All right, let me get, uh, perch. 
Let me get some perch.

608
00:37:42.010 --> 00:37:45.312
Perch? Joe, I'm sorry. 
It's out of season.

609
00:37:45.314 --> 00:37:47.781
Out of season? Yeah.

610
00:37:47.783 --> 00:37:51.184
All right. All right, uh,
let me get some salmon here.

611
00:37:51.186 --> 00:37:53.853
Please don't get mad. 
Don't get mad at me, Joe.

612
00:37:53.855 --> 00:37:56.589
The salmon's crossed off on the board. 
I haven't had salmon in six months.

613
00:37:56.591 --> 00:38:00.293
What the fuck do you have? 
No salmon, no cod, no perch!

614
00:38:00.295 --> 00:38:02.662
I'm sorry. But I know what you need.

615
00:38:02.664 --> 00:38:04.197
What? I know what you need, Joe.

616
00:38:04.199 --> 00:38:05.765
What? Swordfish.

617
00:38:05.767 --> 00:38:07.534
Swordfish? Swordfish is what you need.

618
00:38:07.536 --> 00:38:09.202
Nah, I don't want fuckin' swordfish. 
It's too fuckin' dry.

619
00:38:09.204 --> 00:38:11.638
Trust me. I sell fish. 
You want swordfish.

620
00:38:11.640 --> 00:38:14.774
It's the king of the sea. 
You cook it on the grill, low and slow.

621
00:38:14.776 --> 00:38:16.943
Your guests are gonna love it, Joe.

622
00:38:16.945 --> 00:38:18.812
Wow. Okay. Uh, all right.

623
00:38:18.814 --> 00:38:21.348
Give me fuckin' swordfish. 
Give me, uh, 35 pounds of swordfish.

624
00:38:21.350 --> 00:38:25.151
Thirty-five pounds? Thirty-
- What do I look like?

625
00:38:25.153 --> 00:38:27.987
What do you mean? 
You fuckin' sell fish, 
I need fish, 35 pounds.

626
00:38:27.989 --> 00:38:30.824
Yeah, but 35 pounds is a lot of fish. 
What do I look like, the ocean?

627
00:38:30.826 --> 00:38:33.526
All right, listen, listen.

628
00:38:33.528 --> 00:38:36.329
[bills rustling] Here's $300.

629
00:38:36.331 --> 00:38:39.366
Get me my fuckin'
35 pounds of swordfish, okay?

630
00:38:39.368 --> 00:38:41.201
I'll call you. 
I need it delivered to the house.

631
00:38:41.203 --> 00:38:43.370
Joe, you're getting 40 pounds. That's right, Joe.

632
00:38:43.372 --> 00:38:45.872
Anything for you, Joe.
Joe the king! All right.

636
00:39:13.702 --> 00:39:15.101
Okay.

637
00:39:16.338 --> 00:39:18.371
Okay, I'm sorry too, Meyer.

638
00:39:18.373 --> 00:39:20.340
We would be honored to have you.

639
00:39:23.578 --> 00:39:26.746
So? Says he thinks it's a bad idea.

640
00:39:30.218 --> 00:39:32.118
You agree with him? No.

641
00:39:32.120 --> 00:39:36.723
I mean, I understand what
he's sayin', but it's Meyer.

642
00:39:36.725 --> 00:39:38.792
You think this is a bad idea.

643
00:39:38.794 --> 00:39:42.295
Not at all, Don. 
I would've said somethin' if I thought that.

644
00:39:42.297 --> 00:39:46.032
I'm just sayin', 
I understand what he's thinking.

645
00:39:51.807 --> 00:39:54.140
I trust that you
know how important this is.

646
00:39:54.142 --> 00:39:55.408
I do.

647
00:39:55.410 --> 00:39:57.477
The most important thing I ever did.

648
00:40:05.220 --> 00:40:07.320
How many we got now?

649
00:40:07.322 --> 00:40:08.855
About 50.

650
00:40:09.724 --> 00:40:13.126
[chuckles] That's good.

651
00:40:13.128 --> 00:40:16.629
Yeah, I know, Mike-
- I know you're gonna handle this. 
I know you're gonna do it.

652
00:40:19.134 --> 00:40:20.800
You know what? 
You call this, uh,

653
00:40:20.802 --> 00:40:23.236
this here Meyer back
in a couple of days.

654
00:40:23.238 --> 00:40:26.406
Maybe he's gonna change his mind, you know?

655
00:40:26.408 --> 00:40:28.741
We're gonna give Lucky a call in Italy.

656
00:40:28.743 --> 00:40:30.710
Put some pressure on him.

[phone ringing] Fuck. Hello?

659
00:40:40.522 --> 00:40:42.689
[Mike] So we're up to about 50.

660
00:40:42.691 --> 00:40:45.692
You okay with that? 
Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
It's no problem.

661
00:40:45.694 --> 00:40:49.195
Good. And get some
rooms somewhere the night before.

662
00:40:49.197 --> 00:40:51.631
That gonna be a problem? No problem. 
I'll take care of it.

663
00:40:51.633 --> 00:40:53.366
Good. And remember,

664
00:40:53.368 --> 00:40:56.169
Don Vitone needs some
time with the other guys,

665
00:40:56.171 --> 00:40:58.438
a private room away from everybody.

666
00:40:58.440 --> 00:41:00.373
Mike, I got the perfect room for him.

667
00:41:00.375 --> 00:41:02.809
Sure you can handle this, Joe?

668
00:41:02.811 --> 00:41:04.511
It's a huge opportunity, you know.

669
00:41:04.513 --> 00:41:06.679
Absolutely.

670
00:41:06.681 --> 00:41:09.816
And we're very honored to
host Don Vito in our home.

671
00:41:09.818 --> 00:41:11.651
Good. See you in a couple days.

672
00:41:11.653 --> 00:41:13.720
All right, thanks, Mike.

673
00:41:16.858 --> 00:41:19.025
[chuckles] What?

674
00:41:19.027 --> 00:41:21.794
Fifty. Fifty?

675
00:41:21.796 --> 00:41:24.464
Oh, my God.

676
00:41:24.466 --> 00:41:25.865
Fifty people?

677
00:41:25.867 --> 00:41:29.068
That's a lot of fuckin' people, Joe.

678
00:41:29.070 --> 00:41:30.703
I know.

679

Galante.

681
00:42:18.086 --> 00:42:21.220
Ed, come on. What are
you doin'? Let it go.

682
00:42:21.222 --> 00:42:23.056
Come on. Lieutenant Lane--
the guy's a wet rag.

683
00:42:23.058 --> 00:42:24.357
Yeah.

684
00:42:25.694 --> 00:42:27.594
How come you aren't our lieutenant?

685
00:42:27.596 --> 00:42:29.696
Huh? You been with
the force, what, 15 years?

686
00:42:30.599 --> 00:42:32.532
It's not as easy as you think, Vince.

687
00:42:32.534 --> 00:42:34.434
Why?

688
00:42:34.436 --> 00:42:36.536
I got Lane breathing down my neck.

689
00:42:36.538 --> 00:42:39.205
There you go. It
is a little odd, Ed,

690
00:42:39.207 --> 00:42:41.074
that you're always doing all this research.

691
00:42:41.076 --> 00:42:43.276
Really? Really.

692
00:42:44.746 --> 00:42:47.447
You know what? I gotta-
- I gotta make a phone call.

693
00:42:47.449 --> 00:42:49.782
To who?

694
00:42:49.784 --> 00:42:53.219
Okay, what do we feel like tonight, gang?

695
00:42:54.489 --> 00:42:56.289
Tom Sawyer.

696
00:42:56.291 --> 00:42:59.125
[Sarah] Not again, please, Mommy?

697
00:42:59.127 --> 00:43:01.494
Can you read Kate's First Mate?

698
00:43:01.496 --> 00:43:04.831
[June] Yeah, please, Mommy.

699
00:43:04.833 --> 00:43:07.333
[Billy] Ew. That's a girls' book.

700
00:43:07.335 --> 00:43:09.569
No, Billy. It's not a girls' book

701
00:43:09.571 --> 00:43:12.338
just because the main character is a girl.

702
00:43:12.340 --> 00:43:14.440
I think you would like it.

703
00:43:14.442 --> 00:43:16.409
But how 'bout we
let the girls pick tonight?

704
00:43:16.411 --> 00:43:18.411
We read Tom Sawyer last night.

705
00:43:18.413 --> 00:43:22.782
But Dad always used to
read Tom Sawyer to me.

706
00:43:22.784 --> 00:43:24.817
Oh, I know.

707

Let's-
- Let's...

708

Is everything okay?

Yeah, everything's fine. Okay.

What's up?

719
00:44:24.579 --> 00:44:26.846
I just wanted to apologize for last night.

720

No, no, no. No. No. You don't-
- You don't have to apologize.

721
00:44:31.252 --> 00:44:33.586
Yeah, well, you know...

722
00:44:38.660 --> 00:44:40.660
Is there anything else?

723
00:44:41.429 --> 00:44:42.929
Yeah, um...

724
00:44:44.032 --> 00:44:45.932
I'd like to maybe

725
00:44:45.934 --> 00:44:49.368
take you out to
dinner sometime, to a restaurant.

726
00:44:49.370 --> 00:44:53.139
Yes, yes. Um, yeah. 
I would like that.

727
00:44:54.542 --> 00:44:56.542
Okay, good.

728
00:44:56.544 --> 00:44:58.911
You have somewhere in mind?

729
00:44:58.913 --> 00:45:00.546
Yeah, how about Lupo's?

730
00:45:00.548 --> 00:45:03.549
Yeah, haven't been there in quite a while.

731
00:45:03.551 --> 00:45:06.586
How does tomorrow work?

732
00:45:06.588 --> 00:45:08.554
Say, 6:00?

733
00:45:08.556 --> 00:45:11.124
Um, yeah. That-
- That sounds great.

734
00:45:11.126 --> 00:45:12.692
All right.

735
00:45:12.694 --> 00:45:16.295
Well, um, I'll pick you up at 5:30.

736

Yeah, okay. Okay, 
I'll see you tomorrow.

I'm wholesale.

There's ten pounds in each box.

It's pork chops in there, and you can't have 'em.

00:47:29.764 --> 00:47:32.431
Don't blow smoke up my ass, Croswell.

784
00:47:32.433 --> 00:47:34.166
We both know why you were up there.

785
00:47:34.168 --> 00:47:36.869
You think you got somethin'
on Joe Barbara, don't you?

786
00:47:36.871 --> 00:47:39.772
Yes. He's got numerous mob associations

787
00:47:39.774 --> 00:47:42.942
in Scranton, Pittston, 
New York City.

788
00:47:42.944 --> 00:47:46.245
And you remember that Carmine Galante? 
He's one of the biggest.

789
00:47:46.247 --> 00:47:48.347
Yes, we know all that, Sergeant,

790
00:47:48.349 --> 00:47:51.217
but what has Joe Barbara actually done?

791
00:47:51.219 --> 00:47:55.588
He's got a 1952 Cadillac Fleetwood.

792
00:47:55.590 --> 00:47:57.590
That retails for $4,000.

793
00:47:57.592 --> 00:48:01.560
He's also got a Chrysler Imperial convertible. 
That's another $4,000.

794
00:48:01.562 --> 00:48:04.130
He's got a mansion on 18 acres

795
00:48:04.132 --> 00:48:06.966
with four buildings on
it and an outdoor barbecue.

796
00:48:06.968 --> 00:48:10.436
You're telling me that he gets
all this from selling ginger ale?

797
00:48:10.438 --> 00:48:13.272
You seem to know
a lot about Joe Barbara.

798
00:48:13.274 --> 00:48:15.808
But I'll have you know Mr. Barbara

799
00:48:15.810 --> 00:48:18.477
happens to be a pillar in this community.

800
00:48:18.479 --> 00:48:20.880
You're doin' this without my sanction and approval,

801
00:48:20.882 --> 00:48:23.416
which I can assure
you will not be forthcoming

802
00:48:23.418 --> 00:48:27.219
without a little something called evidence.

803
00:48:27.221 --> 00:48:28.955
Am I makin' myself clear?

804
00:48:28.957 --> 00:48:30.790
Yes sir.

805
00:48:30.792 --> 00:48:32.825
Good.

806
00:48:32.827 --> 00:48:35.761
Here. I want you
to follow up on this.

807
00:48:35.763 --> 00:48:38.397
Break-in at a bakery in Binghamton last night.

808
00:48:43.604 --> 00:48:46.439
Do me a favor, watch the fuckin' ladder? 
I don't wanna break my neck here.

809
00:48:46.441 --> 00:48:48.407
Yeah. You got it, boss.

810
00:48:49.644 --> 00:48:51.944
What are you doing? 
You said to watch it.

811
00:48:51.946 --> 00:48:54.246
Hold the fuckin' ladder, would you?

812
00:48:58.319 --> 00:49:02.221
Hey boss, I can see
you're connectin' the wrong wires.

813
00:49:02.824 --> 00:49:04.657
Mind your own business.

814
00:49:04.659 --> 00:49:06.492
Josephine! What?

815
00:49:06.494 --> 00:49:08.494
Come here for a second. I'm busy.

816
00:49:08.496 --> 00:49:10.029
Jo, five seconds.

817
00:49:10.031 --> 00:49:11.664
I need you to do somethin'. What?

818
00:49:11.666 --> 00:49:13.532
Turn that light on
for me, please. Which one?

819
00:49:13.534 --> 00:49:15.901
That one right there. Turn it on. 
It should be working.

820
00:49:19.674 --> 00:49:22.641
What the fuck was that? What'd you do? 
I did what you told me to do.

821
00:49:22.643 --> 00:49:25.378
You're fuckin' drivin' me crazy! Help me down!

822
00:49:25.380 --> 00:49:26.912
Oh, my God.

823
00:49:29.017 --> 00:49:30.416
I'll be right back.

824
00:49:32.854 --> 00:49:34.787
What are you in the mood for?

825
00:49:34.789 --> 00:49:37.356
Uh, hmm.

826
00:49:37.358 --> 00:49:40.026
Well, I'm thinking the spaghetti tarantina,

827
00:49:40.028 --> 00:49:42.895
although I'll probably be disappointed.

828
00:49:42.897 --> 00:49:45.531
[chuckles] Why disappointed?

829
00:49:45.533 --> 00:49:47.933
Oh-
- Oh, that came out wrong.

830
00:49:49.137 --> 00:49:51.971
I'm not a snob, I promise. 
Oh, it's okay.

831
00:49:51.973 --> 00:49:56.042
It's just that I come from
a long line of Tuscan food aficionados.

832
00:49:56.044 --> 00:49:58.310
I didn't know you were Italian. Mm-hmm.

833
00:49:58.312 --> 00:50:01.380
Well, I know with a name like Passatino...

834
00:50:01.382 --> 00:50:04.750
Yeah, um... No, my maiden name is DiVincenzo.

835
00:50:04.752 --> 00:50:07.520
Well, that is certainly Italian, yeah.

836
00:50:07.522 --> 00:50:09.822
Italian. Yeah.

837
00:50:09.824 --> 00:50:14.093
It's actually Tuscano. 
Um, my family comes from Luca.

838
00:50:14.095 --> 00:50:16.595
Mm. You have no idea
where that is, do you?

839
00:50:16.597 --> 00:50:18.431
No.

840
00:50:18.433 --> 00:50:21.233
My family hails from Nebraska, so...

841
00:50:21.235 --> 00:50:23.736
Good evening. Hi.

842
00:50:23.738 --> 00:50:26.272
Do you have any questions about the menu?

843
00:50:26.274 --> 00:50:27.573
N
-No. No?

844
00:50:27.575 --> 00:50:30.009
Um, I think I'll just have the calamari

845
00:50:30.011 --> 00:50:31.710
and then, uh, spaghetti tarantina.

846
00:50:31.712 --> 00:50:34.547
Excellent choice. 
And for you, sir?

847
00:50:34.549 --> 00:50:36.248
I'm gonna have the steak.

848
00:50:36.250 --> 00:50:38.517
I'm so sorry, sir, but
we're actually out of the steak.

849
00:50:38.519 --> 00:50:41.053
Oh. Well,

850
00:50:41.055 --> 00:50:43.522
in that case, I'll take the pork chops.

851
00:50:43.524 --> 00:50:47.393
My deepest apologies, sir, but we're actually
out of the pork chop as well.

852
00:50:47.395 --> 00:50:49.195
Really?

853
00:50:49.197 --> 00:50:51.730
Yes. There seems to be
an issue with our meat distributor.

854
00:50:51.732 --> 00:50:53.566
Oh.

855
00:50:53.568 --> 00:50:58.070
Okay, well, um... just, 
I'll have the spaghetti.

856
00:50:58.072 --> 00:51:02.074
Excellent choice. 
Any appetizers for you? 
No, thank you.

857
00:51:02.076 --> 00:51:03.509
Very well.

858
00:51:09.917 --> 00:51:12.251
You okay, Ed?

859
00:51:12.253 --> 00:51:14.019
Yeah. Uh...

860
00:51:15.323 --> 00:51:17.957
I was just really
looking forward to a steak.

861
00:51:19.727 --> 00:51:22.061
Who doesn't love spaghetti? Yeah.

862
00:51:26.834 --> 00:51:29.301
How's the wine?

863
00:51:29.303 --> 00:51:31.337
It's very good, thank you.

864
00:51:31.339 --> 00:51:33.772
Why didn't you tell me you
know how to fix the electricity?

865
00:51:33.774 --> 00:51:36.342
I tried to, boss, but you
told me to mind my own business.

866
00:51:36.344 --> 00:51:38.677
Just fix the fuckin' fuse, would you?

867
00:51:38.679 --> 00:51:41.147
Yeah, no problem, boss.

868
00:51:41.149 --> 00:51:44.950
Do you have any idea what's gonna happen
if this house is not ready for the barbecue?

869
00:51:44.952 --> 00:51:48.787
They ransack the house, and then
they shoot us in cold blood.

870
00:51:48.789 --> 00:51:52.491
No, they shoot us in cold
blood, and then they ransack the house.

871
00:51:52.493 --> 00:51:55.327
Are you fuckin' kidding
me right now? Most likely,

872
00:51:55.329 --> 00:51:58.430
if they do it, they're gonna
do it with a model Remington 870.

873
00:51:58.432 --> 00:52:01.300
I'll shove the Remington up your ass! 
Fix the fuckin' fuse!

874
00:52:01.302 --> 00:52:03.802
[Jo] Joe, I need you. I'm coming!

875
00:52:03.804 --> 00:52:06.505
I'll be right fuckin' back. 
This shit better be fuckin' fixed.

876
00:52:06.507 --> 00:52:08.440
So, how's that big case going?

877
00:52:10.311 --> 00:52:13.512
Not great. Oh, no. Why?

878
00:52:13.514 --> 00:52:15.848
The lieutenant shut me down.

879
00:52:15.850 --> 00:52:17.983
Oh, dear. Yeah.

880
00:52:17.985 --> 00:52:19.185
Why did he do that?

881
00:52:19.987 --> 00:52:22.154
He just doesn't see what I see.

882
00:52:22.156 --> 00:52:26.292
What is it that you see? 
It's just a feeling.

883
00:52:26.294 --> 00:52:28.360
I know that something big

884
00:52:28.362 --> 00:52:30.829
is gonna go down right here in Apalachin.

885
00:52:30.831 --> 00:52:32.698
Really? Yeah.

886
00:52:32.700 --> 00:52:35.467
And if the lieutenant
would just back me up...

887
00:52:35.469 --> 00:52:38.637
Well, I believe in you, Ed. 
You keep fighting.

888
00:52:52.920 --> 00:52:54.553
[engine stops]

889
00:53:05.366 --> 00:53:07.299
Oh, wait. Wait.

890
00:53:11.272 --> 00:53:14.340
Uh, I gotta go back inside. I gotta-
- Okay?

891
00:53:14.342 --> 00:53:17.676
I understand. Thank you for dinner.

892
00:53:17.678 --> 00:53:20.212
I'd really like to
take you out again sometime.

893
00:53:20.214 --> 00:53:22.414
Yes. Yeah.

894
00:53:22.416 --> 00:53:24.617
Okay. Let me walk you to the door.

895
00:53:54.081 --> 00:53:56.048
[engine starts]

896
00:54:01.822 --> 00:54:04.723
Really? Uh, how many, Marge?

897
00:54:04.725 --> 00:54:06.992
Oh, I don't know. 
Maybe two dozen.

898
00:54:06.994 --> 00:54:10.296
Well, listen, I'm gonna send Ed over
to take a look at it, okay?

899
00:54:10.298 --> 00:54:13.532
That would be great if you
could send somebody over. All right, Margie.

900
00:54:14.635 --> 00:54:16.902
Hmm. What can I do for you, boss?

901
00:54:16.904 --> 00:54:20.739
Gettin' several reports of bad checks
over at the High Way Motel.

902
00:54:22.843 --> 00:54:26.912
I want you to, uh, go over
there and sort it all out, okay?

903
00:54:26.914 --> 00:54:29.415
Yes sir, but I really...

904
00:54:29.417 --> 00:54:32.484
I need to talk to you. 
I think I'm onto something big here.

905
00:54:32.486 --> 00:54:35.521
So? What's the latest with you and Natalie?

906
00:54:35.523 --> 00:54:38.090
That's really none of your business, Vince.

907
00:54:38.092 --> 00:54:40.459
I'm sorry, Ed. 
I didn't mean to pry.

908
00:54:40.461 --> 00:54:42.328
That's all right. It's just...

909
00:54:44.131 --> 00:54:46.131
We're doin' just fine. That's great.

910
00:54:46.133 --> 00:54:48.801
Hey, Ed, I'm happy to hear that. Thanks.

911
00:54:48.803 --> 00:54:50.703
Are you gonna marry her? Vince!

912
00:54:50.705 --> 00:54:53.339
No, I'm... Look, Ed, I'm sorry.

913
00:54:53.341 --> 00:54:56.675
I'm just asking 'cause my girl
keeps badgering me about gettin' hitched.

914
00:54:56.677 --> 00:54:59.111
Yeah, and what's the problem? I just...

915
00:54:59.113 --> 00:55:01.680
I don't know if I'm
ready for all that, you know?

916
00:55:01.682 --> 00:55:04.283
Still a little bit
of a tomcat, right? [chuckles]

917
00:55:04.285 --> 00:55:06.952
If it ain't broke, why fix it? 
But, no, no, that's not good enough for her.

918
00:55:06.954 --> 00:55:10.823
She wants the ring and
the flowers and the dress.

919
00:55:10.825 --> 00:55:13.892
Well, it sounds like she wants a
wedding more than she wants to be married.

920
00:55:13.894 --> 00:55:15.661
Yeah-
- Ed, yes.

921
00:55:15.663 --> 00:55:18.630
That's it exactly. 
So what am I supposed to do now?

922
00:55:18.632 --> 00:55:21.500
Why are you askin' me? 
Well, 'cause you've been through all this.

923
00:55:21.502 --> 00:55:23.402
You know, I was divorced, Vince.

924
00:55:23.404 --> 00:55:25.237
Ed, that's what makes you an expert, right?

925
00:55:25.239 --> 00:55:27.639
You know better than anybody else, so...

926
00:55:27.641 --> 00:55:29.575
Is being married hard?

927
00:55:29.577 --> 00:55:32.144
Uh, it's harder than getting divorced.

928
00:55:32.146 --> 00:55:34.079
That's what...

929
00:55:34.081 --> 00:55:35.381
Oh.

930
00:55:45.326 --> 00:55:46.925
[door bells jangle]

931
00:55:46.927 --> 00:55:49.395
Hey, Margie. Hi, Mr. Barbara. 
What can I do for you?

932
00:55:49.397 --> 00:55:51.897
I need some rooms. Sure. How many?

933
00:55:51.899 --> 00:55:53.899
How many you got? Pardon?

934
00:55:53.901 --> 00:55:56.735
I need a lot of rooms. 
How many you got? Um...

935
00:55:56.737 --> 00:55:58.737
I think we have 17 available.

936
00:55:58.739 --> 00:56:00.272
I'll take 'em.

937
00:56:00.274 --> 00:56:01.940
Okay, and for how many nights?

938
00:56:01.942 --> 00:56:03.375
Just one night. All right.

939
00:56:03.377 --> 00:56:05.344
You gonna be puttin' down a deposit?

940
00:56:05.346 --> 00:56:07.279
No, I'll pay cash right now. How much?

941
00:56:07.281 --> 00:56:10.282
Um, that comes to 482, even.

942
00:56:13.587 --> 00:56:16.388
Do you know whose car that is? 
No, whose is it?

943
00:56:16.390 --> 00:56:18.257
That's Joe Barbara's Cadillac.

944
00:56:18.259 --> 00:56:19.958
[Vince] That's his?

945
00:56:24.298 --> 00:56:26.365
Here's 500. Keep the change.

946
00:56:26.367 --> 00:56:29.635
Oh, thanks, Mr. Barbara. 
Yeah, no problem.

947
00:56:37.912 --> 00:56:39.111
[whispers] Come on!

948
00:56:40.481 --> 00:56:42.281
I don't have all
the rooms ready just yet,

949
00:56:42.283 --> 00:56:44.383
so you have to pick
up the keys tomorrow morning.

950
00:56:44.385 --> 00:56:46.418
Are you serious? 
You're killin' me.

951
00:56:46.420 --> 00:56:49.721
Uh, could you just leave the
keys over here for me? Oh, sure.

952
00:56:49.723 --> 00:56:52.224
You can just fill out one of
these forms with all the guests' names,

953
00:56:52.226 --> 00:56:53.592
and I'll get everything sorted for you.

954
00:56:53.594 --> 00:56:55.427
Nah, I can't remember the names.

955
00:56:55.429 --> 00:56:59.064
Uh, can I have an
associate come pick 'em up?

956
00:56:59.066 --> 00:57:01.733
[Margie] That'll work. 
All right, then I'll send somebody.

957
00:57:01.735 --> 00:57:04.470
Put it under Galante, Carmine.

958
00:57:04.472 --> 00:57:06.605
Okay.

959
00:57:06.607 --> 00:57:08.507
Fuckin' flies.

960
00:57:08.509 --> 00:57:10.642
All right, he'll be here 11:30, 12:00.

961
00:57:10.644 --> 00:57:12.344
You'll be here, right? I will.

962
00:57:12.346 --> 00:57:14.413
I have 17 rooms. I've got it.

963
00:57:14.415 --> 00:57:17.282
I appreciate it. 
Good to see you, Margie. Bye, Mr. Barbara.

964
00:57:17.284 --> 00:57:19.151
Bye. [door bells jangle]

965
00:57:19.153 --> 00:57:21.053
[door closes]

966
00:57:26.093 --> 00:57:28.861
Okay.

967
00:57:28.863 --> 00:57:32.030
Marge. Geez! Ed, you scared
the bejesus out of me.

968
00:57:32.032 --> 00:57:35.667
I'm sorry about that. 
Uh, can I see this, uh, booking slip?

969
00:57:35.669 --> 00:57:38.036
Oh, sure. Thank you.

970
00:57:38.038 --> 00:57:40.205
What are you lookin' for?

971
00:57:40.207 --> 00:57:43.342
Mr. Barbara is booking up every room tomorrow?

972
00:57:43.344 --> 00:57:46.111
Yeah. Well, don't you
find that to be strange?

973
00:57:46.113 --> 00:57:49.615
Not really. Mr. 
Barbara's always bookin' rooms here.

974
00:57:49.617 --> 00:57:52.985
Never this many though. 
He must be havin' a big party.

975
00:57:52.987 --> 00:57:54.887
[chuckles]

976
00:57:54.889 --> 00:57:57.789
Uh, Margie, can I keep this booking slip? 
I'll get it back to you.

977
00:57:57.791 --> 00:58:00.626
Oh, sure thing, Ed. 
Hey, what about the bounced checks?

978
00:58:00.628 --> 00:58:02.661
Oh, yeah. Um, do
you have those bounced checks?

979
00:58:02.663 --> 00:58:04.196
Oh, gosh. Yeah.

980
00:58:04.198 --> 00:58:07.132
Uh, Vince here's gonna fill out a report.

981
00:58:07.134 --> 00:58:08.734
I'll be right back. 
But I've never actually--

982
00:58:08.736 --> 00:58:10.702
I gotta go to the station. No, 
I really have no idea--

983
00:58:10.704 --> 00:58:12.538
You can do this, man. Come on.

984
00:58:13.874 --> 00:58:16.875
Hi. Hey, Margie.

985
00:58:16.877 --> 00:58:19.211
Kind of a lot. 
No, that's okay. It's, uh--

986
00:58:19.213 --> 00:58:21.547
Policeman's job is never done, right?

987
00:58:21.549 --> 00:58:23.682
I don't wanna waste
too much of your time.

988
00:58:23.684 --> 00:58:26.818
No, it's fine. 
I'm happy to do it. Hey, 
I like the, uh...

989
00:58:26.820 --> 00:58:28.887
What? The polka dot, um-
- What is that called, actually?

990
00:58:28.889 --> 00:58:31.823
It's just a scarf. Just a scarf. That's all-
- [laughs]

991
00:58:31.825 --> 00:58:34.560
It's just a hat. I like it!

992
00:58:34.562 --> 00:58:37.529
Yeah. Ah, thanks. 
Yeah, it's a real... Just got it. 
It's a real wing-dinger.

993
00:58:37.531 --> 00:58:39.865
Sir. Sir. What now?

994
00:58:39.867 --> 00:58:43.068
I know you told me to drop
this, but I'm workin' on somethin' big.

995
00:58:43.070 --> 00:58:45.671
Oh, Christ. What is it? It's Barbara.

996
00:58:45.673 --> 00:58:48.907
He's workin' on somethin' that's gonna be huge.

997
00:58:48.909 --> 00:58:50.742
Are you kidding me? '
Cause I thought I told you

998
00:58:50.744 --> 00:58:52.711
to forget about all this, didn't I?

999
00:58:52.713 --> 00:58:54.680
I know, but Barbara's runnin' around town,

1000
00:58:54.682 --> 00:58:57.683
buying up all the fish and
meat he can get his hands on.

1001
00:58:57.685 --> 00:59:00.686
I mean, I went to Lupo's last night. 
I couldn't even get a steak.

1002
00:59:00.688 --> 00:59:02.854
There is no meat
left in this whole town.

1003
00:59:02.856 --> 00:59:06.558
So what? Maybe he's
throwin' a... wedding or somethin'.

1004
00:59:06.560 --> 00:59:08.894
But he's buying directly from the distributor.

1005
00:59:08.896 --> 00:59:12.297
That's illegal. 
We can open up a case based on that alone.

1006
00:59:12.299 --> 00:59:16.568
Please tell me you got something
more than a fish and game violation.

1007
00:59:16.570 --> 00:59:19.438
I do. I just got
back from the High Way Motel,

1008
00:59:20.874 --> 00:59:24.409
and Barbara has booked up
every room for tomorrow night.

1009
00:59:24.411 --> 00:59:26.378
And guess who he's
got pickin' up the keys.

1010
00:59:26.380 --> 00:59:28.780
Who? Galante.

1011
00:59:31.051 --> 00:59:32.818
Carmine Galante?

1012
00:59:32.820 --> 00:59:35.220
That gangster I picked
up about six months ago.

1013
00:59:35.222 --> 00:59:39.324
Remember, he got mysteriously bailed
out by some state judge?

1014
00:59:41.428 --> 00:59:42.828
[sighs] Listen, we all know

1015
00:59:42.830 --> 00:59:45.263
that Barbara's got ties to organized crime.

1016
00:59:45.265 --> 00:59:47.799
But Carmine Galante's just one of 'em.

1017
00:59:48.469 --> 00:59:50.302
I...

1018
00:59:50.304 --> 00:59:53.071
can't believe I'm gonna say this, but fine.

1019
00:59:53.073 --> 00:59:55.273
Sit on Barbara

1020
00:59:55.275 --> 00:59:57.809
and come up with some goddamn evidence!

1021
00:59:57.811 --> 01:00:00.679
Yes, sir. I'll come
up with some solid evidence.

1022
01:00:00.681 --> 01:00:03.949
Thank you, sir. 
Solid evidence.

1023
01:00:03.951 --> 01:00:07.953
It's a real hoot
talkin' to you, Margie. [giggling]

1024
01:00:07.955 --> 01:00:09.988
Well, it is. Wow.

1025
01:00:09.990 --> 01:00:12.858
Yeah. I was always wondering how
long have you been a cop.

1026
01:00:12.860 --> 01:00:15.494
Oh, right. Well, about, uh, seven years now.

1027
01:00:15.496 --> 01:00:17.462
Yeah, my uncle got me
the job. Yeah. Oh, wow.

1028
01:00:17.464 --> 01:00:19.831
You've never had to use
your gun on anybody, though, right?

1029
01:00:19.833 --> 01:00:21.633
Oh, you betcha, sure. 
Plenty of times, yeah.

1030
01:00:21.635 --> 01:00:23.869
Really? Yeah. One time, actually,

1031
01:00:23.871 --> 01:00:26.371
to help save a pretty girl like you.

1032
01:00:26.373 --> 01:00:28.340
Oh! Wow. Yeah, well...

1033
01:00:28.342 --> 01:00:30.809
[door bells jangle] So,
these checks look very fishy.

1034
01:00:30.811 --> 01:00:33.145
We gotta go. What about
the bounced checks here, though?

1035
01:00:33.147 --> 01:00:35.280
Bring 'em with you. Come on, 
Vince, let's go. Okay.

1036
01:00:35.282 --> 01:00:37.382
All right, Margie. Oh, okay, yep. Be safe.

1037
01:00:39.019 --> 01:00:41.153
We got the green light. For what?

1038
01:00:41.155 --> 01:00:44.389
Listen closely, Vince. 
This is how it's gonna go down.

1039
01:00:44.391 --> 01:00:47.192
I need you to show up at
that motel first thing in the morning.

1040
01:00:47.194 --> 01:00:50.362
Ed, are you sure? 
You think somethin' big is gonna happen in our town?

1041
01:00:50.364 --> 01:00:52.464
I'm positive. Really?

1042
01:00:52.466 --> 01:00:54.366
You can tell. How?

1043
01:00:54.368 --> 01:00:57.135
You look around. 
Look at Joe Barbara. 
Look at the way he's acting.

1044
01:00:57.137 --> 01:00:59.871
He's buying up all the
meat in town. It's just...

1045
01:00:59.873 --> 01:01:02.207
There's too many coincidences. 
That Carmen Galante.

1046
01:01:02.209 --> 01:01:04.142
Oh, that guy doesn't
seem like a nice fellow.

1047
01:01:04.144 --> 01:01:06.144
Well, he's up to
no good. I know it.

1048
01:01:06.146 --> 01:01:08.246
[piano playing]

1049
01:01:11.652 --> 01:01:14.486
Are we over our head over here? Shh!

1050
01:01:14.488 --> 01:01:16.254
[chuckles]

1051
01:01:16.256 --> 01:01:18.623
It's gonna be one for the ages.

1052
01:01:19.860 --> 01:01:22.894
From your mouth to God's ears. 
Oh, he's listening.

1053
01:01:26.533 --> 01:01:29.901
Thank you... for all this.

1054
01:01:29.903 --> 01:01:31.737
Really appreciate it.

1055
01:01:33.440 --> 01:01:35.107
One shot.

1056
01:01:44.718 --> 01:01:45.984
Salute.

1057
01:01:50.457 --> 01:01:52.924
Look at this fuckin' place.

1058
01:01:52.926 --> 01:01:56.128
We're gonna have 100 people over here in a couple days. 
Can you believe this shit?

1059
01:01:56.130 --> 01:01:57.496
I'm ready.

1060
01:01:58.966 --> 01:02:01.066
We better be fuckin' ready.

1061
01:02:01.068 --> 01:02:03.201
We're not ready, we're dead. Relax.

1062
01:02:04.571 --> 01:02:06.271
[chuckles]

1063
01:02:08.575 --> 01:02:10.342
See what happens.

1064
01:02:21.722 --> 01:02:23.555
They're delicious.

1065
01:02:29.596 --> 01:02:33.265
I made you sandwiches to take today. 
Just, you know,

1066
01:02:33.267 --> 01:02:36.067
who knows when you're gonna
get to eat, and so...

1067
01:02:36.069 --> 01:02:37.869
Thank you. I'll get 'em.

1068
01:02:44.812 --> 01:02:46.444
It's gonna be all right.

1069
01:02:46.446 --> 01:02:48.013
I hope so.

1070
01:02:50.584 --> 01:02:52.184
Thanks for lunch.

1071
01:03:41.802 --> 01:03:43.535

1073
01:04:23.076 --> 01:04:25.944
Vince, you there? 
[radio static]

1074
01:04:26.346 --> 01:04:27.913
Vince.

1075
01:04:27.915 --> 01:04:30.248
[Vince] Hey, Ed. 
How's it lookin' up there?

1076
01:04:32.185 --> 01:04:35.620
Yeah, nobody's out here. 
It's still early though.

1077
01:04:35.622 --> 01:04:39.591
How 'bout you? Yeah, same. 
Not much happenin'.

1078
01:04:39.593 --> 01:04:42.928
All right, well, stay alert.

1079
01:04:44.064 --> 01:04:45.830
They'll be showin' up soon.

1080
01:04:48.235 --> 01:04:50.268
And if you see
anything, give me a call.

1081
01:04:50.270 --> 01:04:52.003
All right, copy that.

1082
01:04:53.040 --> 01:04:55.140

[engine stops]

1086
01:05:40.320 --> 01:05:42.887
How we lookin'? Watch me.

1087
01:05:45.625 --> 01:05:48.026
Where have you been?

1088
01:05:48.028 --> 01:05:50.028
You said 12:00, boss.

1089
01:05:50.030 --> 01:05:51.763
It's 12:01! You're a minute late!

1090
01:05:51.765 --> 01:05:53.665
Do me a favor,
start settin' up the bar.

1091
01:05:53.667 --> 01:05:56.167
Please. They're gonna be all
here in about a minute.

1092
01:05:56.169 --> 01:05:58.203
Everything's good. 
Outta my kitchen.

1093
01:05:58.205 --> 01:06:00.538
Okay. Let me know if you need me.

1094
01:06:00.540 --> 01:06:02.941
Ang, how's the caponata?

1095
01:06:02.943 --> 01:06:05.176
It's almost ready. All right. 
Maria, gnocchi?

1096
01:06:05.178 --> 01:06:07.012
Ready. Right over here, drying.

1097
01:06:07.014 --> 01:06:09.180
All right, but put it in the fridge. 
It'll melt in this heat.

1098
01:06:09.182 --> 01:06:10.849
There's no room in the fridge.

1099
01:06:10.851 --> 01:06:13.284
Well, put it in the fridge
in the garage. You got it.

1100
01:06:15.722 --> 01:06:19.124
Dominick? Dominick, why is
that table not set up?

1101
01:06:19.126 --> 01:06:21.159
Didn't I tell you to
set up the fuckin' table?

1102
01:06:21.161 --> 01:06:24.963
Vito Genovese is gonna be here in an hour. 
Why is the table not set up?

1103
01:06:24.965 --> 01:06:27.198
What about the bar? What bar?

1104
01:06:27.200 --> 01:06:30.235
The bar. You said you'd
drown me in the Susquehanna River

1105
01:06:30.237 --> 01:06:32.837
if I didn't set up the bar first.

1106
01:06:32.839 --> 01:06:35.340
You kidding me right now? 
Stop busting my balls about the bar!

1107
01:06:35.342 --> 01:06:36.975
Can you please set up the fuckin' table?

1108
01:06:36.977 --> 01:06:39.077
I need plates, drinks,
everything set up. Would you?

1109
01:06:39.079 --> 01:06:41.312
What about the bar? 
Stop with the fuckin' bar!

1110
01:06:41.314 --> 01:06:43.415
Go set up the fuckin' goddamn table!

1111
01:06:45.519 --> 01:06:48.153
Joe, I need you. 
Come try the sauce.

1112
01:06:48.155 --> 01:06:50.321
What the fuck is wrong with this guy?

1113
01:06:50.323 --> 01:06:52.657
How, how, how.

1114
01:06:52.659 --> 01:06:54.692
It's unbelievable. 
It's unbelievable?

1115
01:06:54.694 --> 01:06:57.429
Yeah, it's unbelievable. 
Better be unbelievable.

1116
01:07:15.282 --> 01:07:16.915
[engine stops]

1117
01:07:19.386 --> 01:07:20.785
[door closes]

1118
01:07:25.692 --> 01:07:28.626
Yeah, I know. The guy hasn't
fuckin' called me back in two days.

1119
01:07:28.628 --> 01:07:30.728
What am I supposed to fuckin' do? 
[knock at door]

1120
01:07:30.730 --> 01:07:32.197
Wait, hold on.

1121
01:07:32.199 --> 01:07:35.467
Oh, God. I gotta go.
I gotta go. I gotta go.

1122
01:07:35.469 --> 01:07:37.435
Door? I told him.

1123
01:07:39.139 --> 01:07:42.040
Where have you been? 
Put it in the freezer. Let's go!

1124
01:07:43.777 --> 01:07:46.077
Where's this fish guy? Relax.

1125
01:07:46.079 --> 01:07:49.414
Relax? I may be the first guy to get
whacked for not havin' enough fish at a party.

1126
01:07:49.416 --> 01:07:51.816
You know that, right? 
Everything will be fine.

1127
01:07:51.818 --> 01:07:53.718
I hope so. You,
any more ice? Yes, sir.

1128
01:07:53.720 --> 01:07:55.320
Go get it. I gotta call Frankie.

[yawns]

1130
01:08:32.259 --> 01:08:34.826
[women chattering] Miss Jo!

1131
01:08:34.828 --> 01:08:37.896
Oh, God. Thank God. 
Joe, fish guy!

1132
01:08:40.834 --> 01:08:42.834
What took you so long? I'm sorry. 
You look beautiful.

1133
01:08:42.836 --> 01:08:45.103
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

1134
01:08:45.105 --> 01:08:47.805
Where the fuck have you been?
Are you crazy? I told you--

1135
01:08:47.807 --> 01:08:49.107
Put it down. Put it down.

1136
01:09:07.060 --> 01:09:10.862
[chief over radio] Croswell, what's your status?

1137
01:09:10.864 --> 01:09:13.798
Just waiting, sir. Waiting? For what?

1138
01:09:15.202 --> 01:09:18.303
For people to arrive. 
How many so far?

1139
01:09:20.006 --> 01:09:22.640
No one, sir. You'd
better be right about this,

1140
01:09:22.642 --> 01:09:24.475
or else it's your badge!

1141
01:09:27.247 --> 01:09:28.646
Copy that.

1142
01:10:07.254 --> 01:10:08.853
Mm.

[sucks teeth, whistles]

1144
01:10:46.226 --> 01:10:48.626
Vasisko, are you there? Hey, Ed. What's up?

1145
01:10:48.628 --> 01:10:50.428
Where have you been? 
I'm at the motel.

1146
01:10:50.430 --> 01:10:52.764
And you didn't see
any cars go by? Nope.

1147
01:10:52.766 --> 01:10:54.966
Well, get your tail up
here as soon as you can!

1148
01:10:54.968 --> 01:10:56.567
Roger that.

1149
01:11:11.451 --> 01:11:14.452
[knock at door] Yeah, I'm comin',
I'm comin', I'm comin', I'm comin'.

1150
01:11:14.454 --> 01:11:15.586
Hey.

1151
01:11:16.489 --> 01:11:17.755
We're all set up.

1152
01:11:22.095 --> 01:11:23.861
Hey, how you doin'? 
Good to see you.

1153
01:11:26.132 --> 01:11:27.865
There's drinks in the living room. 
Please come on in.

1154
01:11:27.867 --> 01:11:29.233
Good to see you.

1155

[horn honking]

1156
01:11:36.543 --> 01:11:38.743
How are you? Good to see you.

1157

[indistinct chatter]

01:11:48.121 --> 01:11:51.389
All right, ladies. Show time.
Let's go. Come here, Stephanie...

1160
01:11:52.792 --> 01:11:55.126
[overlapping chatter]

Hey, how you doin'? 
Good to see you.

Hey, how are ya? 
Good to see you.

Frankie, what's up? How you doin', Joe?

1164
01:12:06.906 --> 01:12:08.806
Good, good, good. Carmine.

1165
01:12:08.808 --> 01:12:11.476
What do you need? You all right? How are you? 
Good to see you.

1166
01:12:11.478 --> 01:12:13.311
You guys know each other, right? Frankie, Mario.

1167
01:12:13.313 --> 01:12:14.712
Good to see you. 
Carmine Galante over here.

Shh! The door! 
[whispers] Sorry.

1171
01:12:33.933 --> 01:12:36.067
What? What's goin' down, Ed?

1172
01:12:36.069 --> 01:12:39.003
Did you not see Carmine
Galante's car back at the motel?

1173
01:12:39.005 --> 01:12:41.139
Um, no.

1174
01:12:43.276 --> 01:12:45.343
Somethin's goin' down. I know it.

1175
01:12:52.585 --> 01:12:54.952
Lieutenant, you there?

1176
01:12:54.954 --> 01:12:56.587
I'm here.

1177
01:12:56.589 --> 01:12:59.056
It's time to call in reinforcements.

1178
01:12:59.058 --> 01:13:01.225
Why? What's goin' on up there?

1179
01:13:01.227 --> 01:13:03.928
The guests have just started to arrive.

1180
01:13:03.930 --> 01:13:05.596
What are they doing?

1181
01:13:05.598 --> 01:13:08.366
Not sure, but there
are more on the way.

1182
01:13:08.368 --> 01:13:11.602
The call went out already. 
Stand by and keep me posted.

1183
01:13:11.604 --> 01:13:13.304
10-4.

1184
01:13:13.306 --> 01:13:16.374
What's the plan, Ed? 
We're waitin' for reinforcements.

1185
01:13:16.376 --> 01:13:18.576
Reinforcements? Yeah.

1186
01:13:18.578 --> 01:13:20.445
Lane's callin' in the FBI.

1187
01:13:20.447 --> 01:13:22.280
Wait, you're tellin' me we're raidin' the place?

1188
01:13:22.282 --> 01:13:25.716
No, just a friendly visit
from the New York State Police.

1189
01:13:25.718 --> 01:13:27.552
[chuckles]

1190
01:13:27.554 --> 01:13:30.888
What do you think
they're doin' in there, Ed?

1191
01:13:30.890 --> 01:13:34.425
I'm not sure, but they're
definitely up to no good. Right.

1192
01:13:34.427 --> 01:13:36.727
Grab my notepad. Ed, 
I gotta tell you somethin'.

1193
01:13:36.729 --> 01:13:38.663
What?

1194
01:13:38.665 --> 01:13:41.365
I lied to you. 
I fell asleep in the cruiser. 
I didn't see a thing.

1195
01:13:42.068 --> 01:13:43.835
I kinda figured.

1196
01:13:46.606 --> 01:13:49.607
Thanks, Ed. That's why you're a good cop.

1197

Come on, Mama, take this out. Let's go!

Let's go, ladies, let's go! 
I need more people to serve! Come on!

I'll tell ya that shit.

[mouths words]

1204
01:14:07.260 --> 01:14:09.193
You guys need anything, you
let me know, all right?

1205
01:14:09.195 --> 01:14:11.295
Have some drinks. 
The big guy will be here in a little bit.

1206
01:14:11.297 --> 01:14:13.965
Thank you, Joe. All
right. Stop smokin'. No smokin'.

01:14:19.973 --> 01:14:22.273
Delta.

1211
01:14:22.275 --> 01:14:25.009
[chuckles] I wrote Delta, Nancy. I just...

1212
01:14:25.011 --> 01:14:28.312
It's just a D and an N.
Ed, I'm so excited. We got 'em!

1213
01:14:28.314 --> 01:14:30.114
It's not over yet though.

1214
01:14:30.116 --> 01:14:33.818
[rock 'n' roll music plays]

1215
01:14:33.820 --> 01:14:36.954
Gentlemen, please come in. Joey Gallo.

1216
01:14:36.956 --> 01:14:38.723
Welcome to our home. 
It's beautiful.

1217
01:14:38.725 --> 01:14:40.625
Thank you. Right in there.

1218
01:14:40.627 --> 01:14:43.127
Please help yourself. 
Food, beverages, anything you might need.

1219
01:14:48.134 --> 01:14:51.068
You guys want a drink? 
You wanna eat somethin'? 
We got a bunch of food.

1220
01:14:51.070 --> 01:14:53.204
Yeah. All right. 
I'll make sure I take care of you.

1221
01:14:53.206 --> 01:14:55.306
Come here. I wanna
talk to you a second.

1222
01:14:55.308 --> 01:14:57.408
[whispering, indistinct]

1223
01:15:02.549 --> 01:15:05.316
Good job, what you guys did back there. 
Truly amazing.

1224
01:15:05.318 --> 01:15:08.286
I tell ya, this kid, he don't miss.

1225
01:15:09.489 --> 01:15:12.089
That's what they say. 
Glad to be of service.

1226
01:15:14.260 --> 01:15:15.893
Oh, here we go.

1227
01:15:17.997 --> 01:15:19.664
Hey, Bill. Guys.

1228
01:15:19.666 --> 01:15:21.532
Steve. Good to see you,
Bill. How are you? Hey, Steve.

1229
01:15:21.534 --> 01:15:23.701
Thanks for comin' out. 
Yeah, sure thing.

1230
01:15:23.703 --> 01:15:26.938
So I think we need to set up
a roadblock about a quarter mile down the road.

1231
01:15:26.940 --> 01:15:29.173
A roadblock? For what? 
There is only one road

1232
01:15:29.175 --> 01:15:32.009
that leads in and out of this town.

1233
01:15:32.011 --> 01:15:33.578
We're gonna create a bottleneck for 'em.

1234
01:15:33.580 --> 01:15:36.948
Once they get settled here,
as they start to leave,

1235
01:15:36.950 --> 01:15:39.350
we'll herd 'em like
cattle right into the pen.

1236
01:15:39.352 --> 01:15:42.353
Buy some time before the feds show up.

1237
01:15:42.355 --> 01:15:44.722
Wait, the-the feds? [Vince] Yeah, 
Lane called in the feds.

1238
01:15:44.724 --> 01:15:46.757
It's really happening.

1239
01:15:46.759 --> 01:15:49.860
[excited chattering]

1240
01:15:49.862 --> 01:15:52.863
Out of my kitchen! I
got it, I got it, I--

1241
01:15:56.869 --> 01:16:00.204
Joe, we're starvin' over here! 
Five more minutes, the guy will be here.

1242
01:16:00.206 --> 01:16:02.873
Put some steaks on the grill, Come on! 
Stop bustin' my fuckin' balls!

1243
01:16:02.875 --> 01:16:06.310
Let's get a drink. 
I'll take you to the kitchen. 
You eat my wife's food.

1244
01:16:06.312 --> 01:16:08.879
[Carmine] Joe, steaks. 
What are you doin'?

1245
01:16:08.881 --> 01:16:10.715
Come on, guys, 
I'll take you to the kitchen.

1246
01:16:12.318 --> 01:16:14.852
Don't tell me this is the cavalry.

1247
01:16:17.991 --> 01:16:19.991
Sergeant Croswell? Yeah?

1248
01:16:19.993 --> 01:16:22.893
Major Ruston. This is Agent Brown. 
We're with ATU.

1249
01:16:24.330 --> 01:16:26.764
ATU? Alcohol and Tax Unit.

1250
01:16:26.766 --> 01:16:28.833
Who called the Department of Treasury?

1251
01:16:28.835 --> 01:16:32.403
Apparently, you did. No. 
There must be a mistake.

1252
01:16:32.405 --> 01:16:34.105
Who were you expecting?

1253
01:16:34.107 --> 01:16:35.840
Well, I don't know. 
Maybe the FBI?

1254
01:16:35.842 --> 01:16:37.341
The FBI?

1255
01:16:38.344 --> 01:16:40.077
Why would the FBI have any interest

1256
01:16:40.079 --> 01:16:42.446
in a small family gathering
out in the middle of nowhere?

1257
01:16:42.448 --> 01:16:46.183
Who the heck is this guy? 
A family gathering?

1258
01:16:46.185 --> 01:16:49.754
Would you guys care to elaborate
what exactly is going on here?

1259
01:16:49.756 --> 01:16:52.923
Are you two blind? 
Do you not see those cars right there?

1260
01:16:55.028 --> 01:16:57.528
Yeah, we do. They look great.

1261
01:16:58.598 --> 01:17:00.598
So what?

1262
01:17:00.600 --> 01:17:03.868
Inside that house is the
top brass of the American Mafia.

1263
01:17:03.870 --> 01:17:05.503
And this is all you got?

1264
01:17:14.280 --> 01:17:16.681
Good to see you. 
Thank you so much. Hey, guys!

1265
01:17:18.284 --> 01:17:20.384
I wanna make a little speech, all right?

1266
01:17:20.386 --> 01:17:21.952
I just got a call.

1267
01:17:21.954 --> 01:17:24.321
The man himself will
be here in ten minutes.

1268
01:17:24.323 --> 01:17:26.857
In the meantime, have
some food, have some drinks.

1269
01:17:26.859 --> 01:17:28.893
You did good, Joe. Thank you.

1270
01:17:28.895 --> 01:17:30.728
All right, salute! [all] Salute.

1271
01:17:30.730 --> 01:17:34.165
All right, fellas, come on. Gather around. Yeah?

1272
01:17:34.167 --> 01:17:37.201
Let's set up that
roadblock on McFall Street Road.

1273
01:17:52.985 --> 01:17:55.453
What's this? Good luck, guys.

1274
01:18:01.828 --> 01:18:04.161
You see this? See this car? 
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1275
01:18:12.105 --> 01:18:14.705
It's him. [Vince] Who's him?

1276
01:18:14.707 --> 01:18:17.274
Vito Genovese. He's here?

1277
01:18:17.276 --> 01:18:20.511
Yeah, he's here. Take a look.

1278
01:18:20.513 --> 01:18:22.847
Maybe you've seen him
on a poster or two.

1279
01:18:25.885 --> 01:18:29.687
Jesus Christ. Now maybe you can get
some of your boys on the horn.

1280
01:18:35.128 --> 01:18:36.761
Sergeant, come in.

1281
01:18:36.763 --> 01:18:39.463
I'm here. Vito Genovese is here.

1282
01:18:41.400 --> 01:18:43.267
Oh shit. Excuse me.

1283
01:18:46.305 --> 01:18:48.139
Don Vitone, good to see you.

1284
01:18:49.208 --> 01:18:50.441
He's here. He's here?

1285
01:18:50.443 --> 01:18:51.909
Just walked in. Come on. Seriously?

1286
01:18:51.911 --> 01:18:53.144
Mm-hmm. Who's he with?

1287
01:18:53.146 --> 01:18:54.612
Two guys. All right, I love you.

1288
01:18:54.614 --> 01:18:56.046
Don Vito.

1289
01:19:00.286 --> 01:19:03.320
Don Vito, what a pleasure
to have you in my home.

1290
01:19:03.322 --> 01:19:06.423
You got a beautiful place here, Joe. 
Thank you for having us.

1291
01:19:06.425 --> 01:19:08.826
Thank you so much. 
This is my beautiful wife, Josephine.

1292
01:19:08.828 --> 01:19:10.661
Hi. Ah. Lovely to meet you.

1293
01:19:10.663 --> 01:19:14.165
Nice to meet you. Here, 
I got a little somethin' for you.

1294
01:19:14.167 --> 01:19:15.666
Oh. This is for you.

1295
01:19:15.668 --> 01:19:17.434
Thank you. Thank you.

1296
01:19:17.436 --> 01:19:19.436
And, Joe, I give you my hand,

1297
01:19:19.438 --> 01:19:21.472
in friendship, whenever you need.

1298
01:19:21.474 --> 01:19:24.175
What an honor. 
Thank you so much. 
We have a special room ready for you.

1299
01:19:24.177 --> 01:19:27.611
All right, Bill. 
I need you to head down that road about two and a half miles.

1300
01:19:27.613 --> 01:19:30.347
If there's not a roadblock already, establish one.

1301
01:19:30.349 --> 01:19:32.416
You got it, boss. 
I want you to cover the perimeter.

1302
01:19:32.418 --> 01:19:35.186
The back of the woods. 
Take Steve with you, okay? You got it, Ed.

1303
01:19:35.188 --> 01:19:36.987
Make sure no one gets out. All right.

1304
01:19:36.989 --> 01:19:39.857
You two stay with me. 
I'm gonna see if we got some backup.

1305
01:19:39.859 --> 01:19:42.259
Hey. Thank you so much.

1306
01:19:42.261 --> 01:19:44.528
[Jo] Go on in. Thank you.

1307
01:19:47.834 --> 01:19:50.968
I appreciate that you're all here

1308
01:19:50.970 --> 01:19:53.370
and everything you've done for me.

1309
01:19:53.372 --> 01:19:55.539
And I wanna thank Joe again.

1310
01:19:55.541 --> 01:19:58.876
I'm not gonna say much. 
He's made this great feast, you know?

1311
01:19:58.878 --> 01:20:00.811
You got meat? Yes, sir. Yeah, yeah.

1312
01:20:00.813 --> 01:20:02.780
I'll go get it. 
Yeah, of course.

1313
01:20:04.150 --> 01:20:07.384
Some, uh, mountains have fallen down on us.

1314
01:20:08.988 --> 01:20:12.356
Charlie will never step
foot on these shores again.

1315
01:20:13.392 --> 01:20:15.960
Albert, may he rest in peace.

1316
01:20:15.962 --> 01:20:18.896
And our good friend Frank Costello,

1317
01:20:18.898 --> 01:20:20.764
he has decided to retire.

1318
01:20:22.034 --> 01:20:23.500
Now we have a void.

1319
01:20:23.502 --> 01:20:25.703
I'm gonna have to take a closer look.

1320
01:20:25.705 --> 01:20:28.372
Write down the rest of these license plates.

1321
01:20:28.374 --> 01:20:30.507
Why don't you check on that backup?

1322
01:20:30.509 --> 01:20:32.710
Roger that.

1323
01:20:32.712 --> 01:20:36.146
Men stumble on stones, not mountains.

1324
01:20:38.517 --> 01:20:41.886
How many of you around
here know their way around stones,

1325
01:20:41.888 --> 01:20:44.622
to keep everybody earning, and I mean everybody?

1326
01:20:46.893 --> 01:20:50.127
Who knows the old ways? 
The La Cosa Nostra?

1327
01:20:59.939 --> 01:21:01.739
Joseph!

1328
01:21:01.741 --> 01:21:02.940
Joe! [Joe] What?

1329
01:21:02.942 --> 01:21:04.174
Come here. What?

1330
01:21:04.176 --> 01:21:05.576
Come here!

1331
01:21:06.445 --> 01:21:07.611
Look!

1332
01:21:11.050 --> 01:21:12.516
Oh, God.

1333
01:21:16.255 --> 01:21:18.622
I'll be right back. 
Don't say anything. Mm-hmm.

1334
01:21:22.628 --> 01:21:24.995
[speaking Italian]

1335
01:21:27.133 --> 01:21:30.267
I want you to make sure that
all the bosses and all the captains,

1336
01:21:30.269 --> 01:21:32.970
all the families...

1337
01:21:32.972 --> 01:21:34.872
I want their loyalty.

1338
01:21:34.874 --> 01:21:36.707
I want their support.

1339
01:21:38.811 --> 01:21:40.711
Boss of bosses.

1340
01:21:40.713 --> 01:21:43.580
Mm. [footsteps]

1341
01:21:43.582 --> 01:21:46.050
What is it? There's police outside.

1342
01:21:48.454 --> 01:21:50.621
Boss.

1343
01:21:50.623 --> 01:21:52.656
It'd be best for us to go.

1344
01:21:52.658 --> 01:21:54.325
Everybody scram!

1345
01:21:55.728 --> 01:21:58.362
[panicked chattering]

1346
01:22:01.400 --> 01:22:03.300
[horn honks]

1347
01:22:08.507 --> 01:22:10.674
[horns honking]

1348
01:22:22.121 --> 01:22:24.221
[honking continues]

1349
01:22:28.527 --> 01:22:31.028
[horse whinnies]

1350
01:22:34.867 --> 01:22:37.534
We got a bunch of
guys headin' into the woods!

1351
01:22:37.536 --> 01:22:39.169
Circle around and grab 'em.

1352
01:22:49.815 --> 01:22:51.582
[grunts]

1353
01:23:04.530 --> 01:23:06.530
[panting] Son of a bitch.

1354
01:23:06.532 --> 01:23:08.999
Frankie, gimme a hand here, will ya?

1355
01:23:09.001 --> 01:23:12.636
Jesus fuckin' Christ, Mario. 
I can't run anymore.

1356
01:23:12.638 --> 01:23:15.539
What the fuck? Come on! Come on, Frankie!

1357
01:23:34.527 --> 01:23:36.994
[phone ringing]

1358
01:23:43.536 --> 01:23:45.669
[ringing continues]

1359
01:23:45.671 --> 01:23:48.505
It's okay. I got it, Ed.

1360
01:23:48.507 --> 01:23:52.242
Hello? [woman] Good morning. Is Mr. 
Croswell available?

1361
01:23:52.244 --> 01:23:55.446
Uh, yes. Hold on one second. 
Ed, it's for you.

1362
01:23:57.183 --> 01:23:58.649
Thank you.

1363
01:24:00.553 --> 01:24:02.553
Hello? Mr. Croswell?

1364
01:24:02.555 --> 01:24:04.855
Speaking. This is the White House.

1365
01:24:04.857 --> 01:24:07.591
Are you available to speak with the president?

1366
01:24:07.593 --> 01:24:09.426
Yeah, of course.

1367
01:24:09.428 --> 01:24:12.162
Mr. Croswell, we have
the president on the line.

1368
01:24:13.265 --> 01:24:14.965
[President Eisenhower] Sergeant Ed Croswell?

1369
01:24:14.967 --> 01:24:17.734
Yes, Mr. President. 
I just wanted to give you a call

1370
01:24:17.736 --> 01:24:20.737
and personally congratulate you
for all your hard work.

1371
01:24:20.739 --> 01:24:23.440
I didn't want you to
think that it's gone unnoticed.

1372
01:24:23.442 --> 01:24:25.209
Thank you, sir.

1373
01:24:25.211 --> 01:24:27.277
Now, I know those convictions didn't stick,

1374
01:24:27.279 --> 01:24:30.047
but I wanted you to
hear this from me first.

1375
01:24:30.049 --> 01:24:32.483
I've instructed Director Hoover to publicly denounce

1376
01:24:32.485 --> 01:24:35.919
this organized crime syndicate in
a speech this upcoming week,

1377
01:24:35.921 --> 01:24:38.489
and it's all thanks to
you and your hard work.

1378
01:24:39.625 --> 01:24:42.926
Why, thank you, sir. 
Keep up the good work, son.

1379
01:24:42.928 --> 01:24:44.628
Will do.

1380
01:24:48.501 --> 01:24:50.367
Ed, is everything okay?

1381
01:24:52.138 --> 01:24:53.470
Yeah.

1382
01:24:55.841 --> 01:24:57.541
Everything's fine.

1383
01:25:07.319 --> 01:25:09.419
[music plays]
