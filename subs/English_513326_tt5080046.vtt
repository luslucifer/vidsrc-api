ROBOTAXI: Good
morning, Edward.

You are 103 miles from
your point of origin.

I am reaching the boundaries
of my operating range.

00:00:30.467 --> 00:00:31.901
My apologies.

EDWARD: Dammit, all right.

8
00:00:33.871 --> 00:00:37.106
Yeah, there's a platform
coming up on the left.

00:00:37.108 --> 00:00:38.142

murder police at my age.

My tender years were spent

as grease monkey
to Babbage Boxes.

tell us why you've done

- I didn't do anything.

CARTER: But it's inhumane.

39
00:02:53.777 --> 00:02:55.310
EDWARD: It's the very
definition of humane.


40
00:02:55.312 --> 00:02:56.578
This is what human feels
like. You don't remember?

- East, is it?

- I went west into the park.
- Are you sure?


55
00:03:13.664 --> 00:03:15.364
Yes, I went west into the park

56
00:03:15.366 --> 00:03:16.765
and then I stopped
at the fountain.


57
00:03:16.767 --> 00:03:18.701
I wiped the fountain
with my handkerchief.

59

LAUREL: On the fountain?

61
00:03:21.772 --> 00:03:22.771
My right.

62
00:03:22.773 --> 00:03:25.374
Turn the knob and then I sipped.

63
00:03:25.376 --> 00:03:26.309
LAUREL: How many swallows?

64
00:03:26.311 --> 00:03:27.577
Are you kidding?

65
00:03:27.579 --> 00:03:28.376

up the synapses, Carter.


66
00:03:28.378 --> 00:03:29.578
I don't know, four?

67
00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:31.947
Seven swallows. 16
seconds slurp, slurping.


68
00:03:31.949 --> 00:03:33.649
Okay. And then
I headed toward-


69
00:03:33.651 --> 00:03:34.750
- EDWARD: You were thirsty?

70
00:03:34.752 --> 00:03:36.018
I guess?

71
00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:37.252
EDWARD: I thought the
Tangle had cured thirst.


72
00:03:37.254 --> 00:03:38.588
I know when to drink,
I like the feeling


73
00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:39.822
- on my tongue.
- He knows when to drink.


74

I went to the pier and then
I looked out at Echo Lake.

00:03:45.163 --> 00:03:46.429
- No.
- Yes.


78

LAUREL: You took
a beat on the lawn.


79
00:03:47.132 --> 00:03:48.364
I did?

80
00:03:48.366 --> 00:03:49.165
EDWARD: Stop
screwing with us!


81
00:03:49.167 --> 00:03:50.098
I don't remember!

82
00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:51.199
EDWARD: Then remember!

83
00:03:51.201 --> 00:03:53.803
Okay, I paused on the lawn

84
00:03:53.805 --> 00:03:55.604
- and then I went lake-ward.
- No!


85
00:03:55.606 --> 00:03:57.072
- Yes.
- Again!

00:03:57.074 --> 00:03:59.142
Car dumps me on the corner
of Park and Echo Park.

00:03:59.144 --> 00:04:00.342
I head west into the park.

88
00:04:00.344 --> 00:04:01.543
I stop at the water fountain.

89
00:04:01.545 --> 00:04:03.478
With my right hand,
I turn the knob.


90
00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:04.412
I drink seven swallows...

91
00:04:04.414 --> 00:04:05.982
EDWARD: Before you drink.

92
00:04:05.984 --> 00:04:08.518
I, uh, I, I wiped
off the fountain.


93
00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:09.452
EDWARD: Why?

94
00:04:09.454 --> 00:04:10.286
Germs.

95
00:04:10.288 --> 00:04:11.120
EDWARD: Germs?

96
00:04:11.122 --> 00:04:12.388
Habit.

97
00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:13.722
EDWARD: I have three
years of your behavior.


98
00:04:13.724 --> 00:04:16.092
Macro, micro, dramatic, mundane.

99
00:04:16.094 --> 00:04:17.359
No hint of a clean freak.

100
00:04:17.361 --> 00:04:18.660
Old habit from before.

101
00:04:18.662 --> 00:04:20.061
- Just kicked in again?
- Maybe you're playing


102
00:04:20.063 --> 00:04:21.196
for time, Carter?

103
00:04:21.198 --> 00:04:22.297
I used to be a
germophobe from before.


104
00:04:22.299 --> 00:04:23.532
EDWARD: Not when we knew you.

105
00:04:23.534 --> 00:04:24.734
CARTER: Long time
ago when I was a kid.


106
00:04:24.736 --> 00:04:25.667
LAUREL: Maybe you
were loitering a little.


107
00:04:25.669 --> 00:04:26.835
CARTER: Just a nervous habit.

108
00:04:26.837 --> 00:04:27.802
EDWARD: You were nervous?

109
00:04:27.804 --> 00:04:29.071
- No.
- Why were you nervous?


110
00:04:29.073 --> 00:04:30.138
- I wasn't nervous!
- You were excited.


111
00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:31.040
- No!
- You were looking


112
00:04:31.042 --> 00:04:32.107
- for someone.
- No.

length of every breath,

now you simply want me

about Cleopatra?

Is she a-okay?

be why you're here.

hand on knob, I twist.

I drink. Seven
swallows, apparently.

Go ahead.

chain and rub it

- Yeah.

Why?

Habit.

You got a lot of habits.

Nothing.

157

I'm looking at
your lying eyes.


158

Why were you in the park?

159

Just going for a
walk. A constitutional.

To Kodak the moment. I hadn't
seen it since the election.

15 times larger than the
Luxor Obelisk in Paris.

The paperweight?

Who is it right here?

That's a device
called a paperweight.

Belonged to my
grandfather, actually.

You tell me. I don't know.

drinking, you follow her.

She stops, you stop, or
you pull out your key chain.

You look directly at her.

So distortion
of your eyeballs,

0.3 millimeters, which
means you were focused

6.3 meters in front of you.

at her, Carter?

She says, "Cleo,"
she turns and looks


204
00:07:32.823 --> 00:07:34.657
in your direction, you
look at each other.


205

Immediately. Reflex takes over.

323
00:11:51.481 --> 00:11:54.148
The Tangle just adds
another layer of reflex.


324
00:11:54.150 --> 00:11:56.018
I go to touch a
hot stove. I can't.

rolls me to safety.

It's why we don't need

I go to strike someone,
my arms would freeze.

turn off your overrides


346
00:12:38.395 --> 00:12:40.162
so you could kill Margot Foster?

347

What?

348
00:12:41.598 --> 00:12:43.364
Did she send little signals
to our microscopic pals,


349
00:12:43.366 --> 00:12:44.899
tell them to stand down

350
00:12:44.901 --> 00:12:46.768
so you could put a crater
in your enemy's forehead?


351
00:12:46.770 --> 00:12:48.338
I didn't kill Margot.

The Tangle is to the internet

356
00:13:02.053 --> 00:13:04.552
what the HAL 9000
is to the abacus.

Internet of Things,

our cars, our coffee-makers,

our parking meters.

Everything we make connected
together in a weave.


363
00:13:21.005 --> 00:13:23.705
Then Cleo created the Tangle.

364
00:13:23.707 --> 00:13:26.508
The Tangle connects the
trillion-trillion-fold swarm

Within days of the

00:24:14.891 --> 00:24:16.593
Repeated impact to the face.

647

You're one of the few people

648

technical ability


649
00:24:22.432 --> 00:24:25.533
to kill Margot and you
had the motivation.

Well, they don't use the
Tangle, but they're on it.


657
00:24:36.780 --> 00:24:38.512
Some of them do daily X-rays

658
00:24:38.514 --> 00:24:40.181
to eliminate the microdrones.

659
00:24:40.183 --> 00:24:41.883
Then they're immediately
infected again.

662

Oh, I'm a Tangle

666

She still in the Watchtower?

Yeah.

669

Is it locked down, sealed
up, watched, and warded?


670

Whoever killed Margot
might want Cleo.


671

It's still hidden
away, Carter.

what they're guarding.

He said he thought I killed
Margot on Cleo's orders.

Yeah, Margot
strongly supported


675
00:25:11.447 --> 00:25:13.448
relieving Cleo of some
of her responsibilities.

to kill Margot.

You and Cleo both with motives,

capabilities with motives.

understood Cleopatra.

You always said that.

Only you grokked Cleopatra,

689
00:25:41.344 --> 00:25:43.310
yet she's never
surprised me once.


690
00:25:43.312 --> 00:25:45.412
Door was deadbolted
with the chair


691
00:25:45.414 --> 00:25:47.649
secured under the door.

692
00:25:47.651 --> 00:25:49.416
Yeah, we had to
bust the door down.


693
00:25:49.418 --> 00:25:50.718
Why would she
barricade the door?


694
00:25:50.720 --> 00:25:51.952
Maybe she didn't.

695
00:25:51.954 --> 00:25:54.055
Maybe the killer didn't
wanna be interrupted.


696
00:25:54.057 --> 00:25:57.025
All this evidence strongly
suggests that she was alone.

All this evidence
but her dead body.

What's with the
radiation wear?


700
00:26:02.665 --> 00:26:05.866
Margot was a field agent,
the only one of us on Tangle.


701
00:26:05.868 --> 00:26:07.501
That's called a ghost suit.

702
00:26:07.503 --> 00:26:08.670
It's invisible to the Tangle,

703
00:26:08.672 --> 00:26:10.939
it's our out-on-the-town
dresswear.


704
00:26:10.941 --> 00:26:14.041
Nano-impermeable, so
we don't get infected.


705
00:26:14.043 --> 00:26:16.478
You wear one of these,
you drop off Tangle?


706
00:26:16.480 --> 00:26:19.180
The suit generates a
static algorithmic field.


707
00:26:19.182 --> 00:26:21.281
It neutralizes the microdrones.

708
00:26:21.283 --> 00:26:23.284
Wherever we go,
microdrones report


709
00:26:23.286 --> 00:26:24.585
empty space to the Tangle.

710
00:26:24.587 --> 00:26:26.254
But it's visible to the eye.

711
00:26:26.256 --> 00:26:28.189
Who uses their
naked eyes anymore?


712
00:26:28.191 --> 00:26:29.490
So you wear one of these,

713
00:26:29.492 --> 00:26:30.924
and you can walk
through the city


714
00:26:30.926 --> 00:26:34.028
in plain view and no
one knows you're there.

Wait, Margot was on Tangle,

718
00:26:40.904 --> 00:26:42.569
why would she need
one of these suits?


719
00:26:42.571 --> 00:26:44.204
LAUREL: Well, she had
to wear the ghost suits


720
00:26:44.206 --> 00:26:47.342
in the saferoom so the
saferooms remained safe.

off the helmet.

There's no damage
to that at all.


724
00:26:52.281 --> 00:26:54.283
No, she wouldn't
do that voluntarily.


725
00:26:55.751 --> 00:26:58.720

microdrones infected the room.

We formed a tech
collective of sorts.

We cashed out our options,
put it all in a big bucket,

It's an art, not a science,

878

because right after
the connection,


879

the excitement slowly changed

into something more
muted, more serious.


881

anything from the Tangle.

made me through and through.


1749

I am fashioning a world designed

just as you wanted.

But it had to be
one of those agents.

only places I can't see.

CLEOPATRA: I want you
to find whoever did it.

make them very dangerous.

said about the Tangle, right?

Will you talk back?

CLEOPATRA: Yes, but
it might be subtle.


1765
01:28:17.830 --> 01:28:19.566
Like tea leaves, hexagrams,

1766
01:28:20.733 --> 01:28:23.970
and yarrow stalks, the
lines on your palms.
