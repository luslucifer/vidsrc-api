Doug?

6
00:04:21.131 --> 00:04:23.338
Honey, are you all right?

7
00:04:25.631 --> 00:04:28.380
You were dreaming. Doug?

8
00:04:29.464 --> 00:04:31.421
Was it about Mars?

9
00:04:37.131 --> 00:04:39.296
- Is that better?
- Hmm.


10
00:04:41.631 --> 00:04:43.296
My poor baby.

11
00:04:44.422 --> 00:04:46.796
This is getting to be an obsession.

12
00:04:54.714 --> 00:04:56.130
Was she there?

13
00:04:58.297 --> 00:05:00.130
Who?

14
00:05:01.797 --> 00:05:04.421
The one you told me about.
The brunette.


15
00:05:05.297 --> 00:05:06.921
Oh, Lori.

16
00:05:09.881 --> 00:05:12.755
I can't believe
you're jealous of a dream.


17
00:05:13.631 --> 00:05:16.296
- Who is she?
- Nobody.


18
00:05:16.464 --> 00:05:18.755
"Nobody"? What's her name?

19
00:05:18.922 --> 00:05:21.421
- I don't know.
- (LAUGHS)


20
00:05:21.589 --> 00:05:23.463
- Tell me!
- I don't know!


21
00:05:23.631 --> 00:05:25.588
You better tell me!

22
00:05:25.756 --> 00:05:29.421
It's not funny, Doug.
You dream about her every night.


23
00:05:29.589 --> 00:05:32.171
And I'm always back
in the morning.


24

Let me go!

25

Come on, baby.

26
00:05:38.672 --> 00:05:41.338
You know you're the girl
of my dreams.

28

- Do what?

a perfectly wonderful morning?

Just think about it.

51
00:07:24.964 --> 00:07:28.463
Sweetheart, we've been through this
a million times. You'd hate it on Mars.

00:07:28.631 --> 00:07:31.463
It's dry, it's ugly, it's boring.

You believe him?

56
00:07:47.297 --> 00:07:49.588
Okay. Forget about it.

57
00:07:52.464 --> 00:07:56.921
<i>Absolutely not. Mars was colonised by

Lori, don't you understand?

76
00:09:03.797 --> 00:09:06.630
I feel like I was meant
for something more than this.

I want to be somebody.

Now, help me out here, Doug.

- You were interested in a memory of...
- Of Mars.


126

Yeah. Mars.

- Is there a problem?
- Uh...


128
00:13:05.547 --> 00:13:08.630
To be perfectly honest with you, Doug,
if outer space is your thing,


129
00:13:08.797 --> 00:13:11.713
you'd be much happier
with one of our Saturn cruises.


130
00:13:11.881 --> 00:13:13.296
Everybody raves about them.

131
00:13:13.464 --> 00:13:16.296
No. I'm not interested in Saturn.
I said Mars.


132
00:13:17.214 --> 00:13:19.296
Okay. You're the boss.

133
00:13:20.047 --> 00:13:21.963
Mars it is.

134
00:13:22.714 --> 00:13:24.380
Now, let me see.

135
00:13:24.547 --> 00:13:29.880
The basic Mars package
will run you 899 credits.


136
00:13:30.047 --> 00:13:33.338
Now, that's for two full weeks
of memories, complete in every detail.


137
00:13:33.506 --> 00:13:36.963
If you want a longer trip, that'll cost you
more cos it's a deeper implant.


138
00:13:37.131 --> 00:13:39.421
What's in the two-week package?

139
00:13:39.589 --> 00:13:43.130
When you go Rekall, you get nothing
but first-class memories.


140
00:13:44.422 --> 00:13:48.171
Private cabin on the shuttle, deluxe suite
at the Hilton, all the major sights:


141
00:13:48.339 --> 00:13:53.171
Mount Pyramid, the Grand Canals
and of course, Venusville.


142
00:13:53.339 --> 00:13:55.088
But how real does it seem?

143
00:13:55.256 --> 00:13:59.338
- As real as any memory in your head.
- Come on. Don't bullshit me.


144
00:13:59.506 --> 00:14:02.296
No. I'm telling you, Doug.
Your brain will not know the difference.


145
00:14:02.464 --> 00:14:04.463
And that's guaranteed
or your money back.


146
00:14:04.631 --> 00:14:08.005
What about the guy you lobotomised?
Did he get a refund?


147
00:14:11.714 --> 00:14:13.671
You're talking ancient history.

Check out those statistics.

150
00:14:19.922 --> 00:14:23.463
Besides, a real holiday
is a pain in the butt.


151
00:14:23.631 --> 00:14:28.338
You got lost luggage, lousy weather,
crooked taxi drivers.


152
00:14:28.506 --> 00:14:33.755
When you travel with Rekall,
everything is perfect.


153
00:14:33.922 --> 00:14:36.005
So, what do you say?

154
00:14:37.131 --> 00:14:39.755
- All right.
- Smart move.

All right,
while you fill out this questionnaire,


156
00:14:43.381 --> 00:14:45.796
I'm going to familiarise you
with some of our options.


157
00:14:45.964 --> 00:14:47.546
No options.

158
00:14:48.422 --> 00:14:51.921
Whatever you say.
Can I ask you just one question?


159
00:14:52.922 --> 00:14:54.838
What is that is exactly the same

160
00:14:55.006 --> 00:14:58.005
about every single vacation
you have ever taken?


161
00:14:59.006 --> 00:15:00.213
I give up.

162
00:15:00.381 --> 00:15:03.005
You. You're the same.

163
00:15:03.172 --> 00:15:05.755
No matter where you go, there you are.
It's always the same old you.


164
00:15:06.714 --> 00:15:10.588
Let me suggest that you take
a vacation from yourself.


165
00:15:10.756 --> 00:15:12.380
I know, it sounds wild.

166
00:15:12.547 --> 00:15:15.255
It is the latest thing in travel.
We call it the Ego Trip.


167
00:15:15.422 --> 00:15:17.463
No. I'm not interested in that.

168

You're gonna love this, Doug.

169

We offer you a choice of
alternate identities during your trip.


170
00:15:23.256 --> 00:15:26.755
Why go to Mars as a tourist,
when you can go as a playboy?


171
00:15:26.922 --> 00:15:29.880
- Or a famous jock or...?
- "Secret agent."


172
00:15:30.047 --> 00:15:31.755
How much is that?

173
00:15:33.089 --> 00:15:36.296
A-ha! Let me tantalise you.

174
00:15:37.464 --> 00:15:42.130
You are a top operative under deep cover
on your most important mission.

People are trying to kill you.
Left and right!


176
00:15:44.964 --> 00:15:47.921
You meet this beautiful,
exotic woman.


177

Go on.

I don't wanna spoil it for you, Doug,

179
00:15:52.131 --> 00:15:54.171
but by the time the trip is over,

180
00:15:54.339 --> 00:15:58.255
you get the girl, kill the bad guys
and save the entire planet.


181
00:15:58.422 --> 00:16:03.130
Now, you tell me.
Isn't that worth a measly 300 credits?

Well, don't worry. Things hardly ever
fuck up around here.

Good evening... Doug.

to integrate some alien stuff?

Sure. Why not?

- Two-headed monsters?
- Don't you keep up with the news?


191
00:16:42.464 --> 00:16:46.046
- We're doing alien artefacts now.
- It's wild.


192
00:16:46.214 --> 00:16:48.796
Yeah, they date back a million years.

- That's a new one.

- Blue sky on Mars.
- Been married long?

- Eight years.
- Oh, I see.

Slipping away for
a little hanky-panky.

- No. I'm fascinated with Mars.
- All systems go.

so we can fine-tune the Ego program.


201
00:17:13.089 --> 00:17:15.921
You answer honestly,
you'll enjoy yourself a whole lot more.


202
00:17:16.089 --> 00:17:18.838
- Your sexual orientation.
- Hetero.

Blonde? Brunette? Redhead?

205
00:17:30.172 --> 00:17:31.546
Brunette.

206
00:17:33.881 --> 00:17:38.171

- Use your head, you dumb bitch.

He's just acting out the "secret agent"
portion of his ego trip.

Because we haven't implanted it yet.

00:40:02.464 --> 00:40:05.130
<i>All my life I've worked
for Mars Intelligence.</i>


458
00:40:05.297 --> 00:40:07.505
<i>I did Cohaagen's dirty work.</i>

459
00:40:07.672 --> 00:40:10.505
<i>But a few weeks ago
I met somebody, a woman,</i>


460
00:40:10.672 --> 00:40:12.671
<i>and I learned a few things.</i>

461
00:40:12.839 --> 00:40:15.421
<i>Like I've been playing
for the wrong team.</i>


462
00:40:16.714 --> 00:40:19.796
<i>All I can do now is try
to make up for it.</i>


463
00:40:20.589 --> 00:40:23.921
<i>There's enough shit in here
to fuck Cohaagen good.</i>


464
00:40:24.089 --> 00:40:28.130
<i>Unfortunately, if you're listening to
this, that means he has got to me first.</i>


465
00:40:29.089 --> 00:40:30.838
<i>Here comes the hard part,
old buddy.</i>


466
00:40:31.006 --> 00:40:33.130
<i>Now it is all up to you.</i>

467
00:40:33.297 --> 00:40:34.505
Great.

468
00:40:46.381 --> 00:40:48.171
- What have we got?
- Nothing here.


469
00:40:48.339 --> 00:40:50.588
- He's gone.
- I got a weak signal over there.


470
00:40:50.756 --> 00:40:52.171
Split up. Find him.

471
00:40:52.339 --> 00:40:55.255
<i>First let's get rid
of that bug in your head.</i>


472
00:40:55.422 --> 00:40:59.088
<i>Take this thing out of the case
and stick it up your nose.</i>


473
00:40:59.256 --> 00:41:01.296
<i>Don't worry. it's self-guiding.</i>

474
00:41:07.214 --> 00:41:09.255

00:41:18.547 --> 00:41:20.338
<i>Just pull it out.</i>

479
00:41:20.506 --> 00:41:22.671
<i>Be careful. 
It's my head too.</i>

480
00:41:22.839 --> 00:41:25.463
Ah! Ah!

481
00:41:44.714 --> 00:41:48.421
- I've got a lock.
- Up. Let's go.

<i>then go to the Hilton and flash
the Brubaker ID at the desk.</i>


485
00:41:57.172 --> 00:41:58.880
<i>That's all there's to it.</i>

486
00:41:59.047 --> 00:42:00.671
<i>Just do what I tell you.</i>

487
00:42:00.839 --> 00:42:04.796
<i>And we can nail that son of the bitch
who fucked you and me.</i>


488
00:42:04.964 --> 00:42:06.880
<i>I'm counting on you, buddy.</i>

489
00:42:07.047 --> 00:42:08.713
<i>Don't let me down.</i>

(SQUEAKING)

491
00:42:37.506 --> 00:42:38.713
Straight ahead.

492
00:42:42.797 --> 00:42:44.380
In there.

493
00:42:52.672 --> 00:42:54.171
There!

495

Mr. Cohaagen wants to see you
right away.


511
00:44:48.714 --> 00:44:50.255
Any news of Quaid?

512
00:44:50.422 --> 00:44:53.380
- Not since you lost him.
- Watch your mouth, Captain...


513
00:44:54.464 --> 00:44:57.463
- So how long do you plan to stay?
- Two weeks.


514
00:44:58.047 --> 00:45:00.338
Look at that shit.

515
00:45:00.506 --> 00:45:04.005
- What the hell's this?
- The Martians love Kuato.


516
00:45:04.172 --> 00:45:06.171
They think he's fuckin'
George Washington.


517
00:45:06.339 --> 00:45:07.963
Kill the bastard.

518

Nobody knows who he is.

519

Have you brought
any fruits or vegetables?


520

Two weeks.

521
00:45:16.881 --> 00:45:18.255
Excuse me?

522
00:45:18.422 --> 00:45:20.880
Two weeks.

523
00:45:22.047 --> 00:45:24.296

took over the refinery last night.


526
00:45:32.922 --> 00:45:34.838
No terbinium is going out.

527
00:45:35.006 --> 00:45:36.505

- That's Quaid!
- Where?

The woman!
Get him... her!


533
00:46:04.006 --> 00:46:05.463
Arrest that woman!

534
00:46:05.631 --> 00:46:07.130
Get that woman. Grab her!

535
00:46:36.881 --> 00:46:37.963
Catch!

536
00:46:40.214 --> 00:46:42.255

- Open the goddamn door!
- I can't!


544
00:47:55.256 --> 00:47:56.463
Open it!

They're all connected!

That's terrible.

547
00:48:09.214 --> 00:48:11.130
A few days ago
Cohaagen raised the price of air.

00:48:11.297 --> 00:48:12.463
Again?

549
00:48:12.631 --> 00:48:14.921
Nobody on Earth gives a damn
what happens up here.


550
00:48:15.089 --> 00:48:17.546
They just want our terbinium
so they can fight their war.


551
00:48:17.714 --> 00:48:19.630
Excuse me. What's that?

552
00:48:19.797 --> 00:48:21.838
You mean the Pyramid Mine?

553
00:48:22.006 --> 00:48:25.463
I used to work there until
they found that alien shit inside.


554
00:48:25.631 --> 00:48:27.463
Well, that's a rumour, isn't it?

555
00:48:28.131 --> 00:48:29.380
Think so?

556
00:48:59.006 --> 00:49:00.421
Mr. Cohaagen.

557
00:49:07.922 --> 00:49:09.838
You wanted to see me, sir?

558
00:49:13.422 --> 00:49:14.838
Richter...

559
00:49:16.131 --> 00:49:18.088
Do you know why
I'm such a happy person?


560
00:49:18.256 --> 00:49:19.588
No, sir.

561
00:49:21.714 --> 00:49:24.963
Because I've got the greatest job
in the solar system.


562
00:49:25.131 --> 00:49:28.505
As long as the terbinium keeps flowing,
I can do anything I want.


563
00:49:29.339 --> 00:49:30.921
Anything.

564
00:49:32.339 --> 00:49:35.421
In fact, the only thing
that I ever worry about


565
00:49:35.589 --> 00:49:40.921
is that one day, if the rebels win,
it all might end...


566
00:49:42.172 --> 00:49:43.671
and you're fucking making it happen!

567
00:49:44.839 --> 00:49:47.713
First you try to kill Quaid,
then you let him get away.


568
00:49:47.881 --> 00:49:50.130
He had help from our side, sir.

569
00:49:51.214 --> 00:49:52.380
I know that.

570
00:49:54.714 --> 00:49:56.755
- But I thought...
- Who told you to think?


571
00:49:56.922 --> 00:49:59.921
I don't give you enough information
to think.


572
00:50:02.047 --> 00:50:05.130
You do what you're told.
That's what you do.


573
00:50:07.589 --> 00:50:09.005
Yes, sir.

574
00:50:09.714 --> 00:50:11.630
Now...

575
00:50:13.922 --> 00:50:15.546
Let's get to business.

576
00:50:17.297 --> 00:50:19.588
We've got a tricky situation here.

577
00:50:19.756 --> 00:50:21.963
Kuato wants what's in Quaid's head.

578
00:50:23.714 --> 00:50:26.755
And he might be able to get it,
cos they say he's psychic.


579
00:50:28.297 --> 00:50:31.338
And I have a plan
to keep this from happening.


580
00:50:34.839 --> 00:50:36.380
Do you think you could play along?

581
00:50:36.547 --> 00:50:38.588
- Yes, sir.
- Great.


582
00:50:38.756 --> 00:50:41.130
Cos otherwise, 
I'll erase your ass.

identification? Yeah, you too.

I got magazines, music, whisky.

Yes, I would like
to have a room, please.

Nice to have you back, Mr. Brubaker.
Would you like the same suite?


590
00:51:43.714 --> 00:51:45.380
Oh, definitely.

591
00:51:47.381 --> 00:51:49.505
Seems you've left something
in our safe.

Could you get it, please?

- I'll encode your room key.
- Thank you.

- Suite 610 in the east wing.
- Thank you.

- Could I borrow your pen, please?
- Certainly.

- What's wrong with this one?
- He ain't got five kids to feed.

00:52:58.047 --> 00:53:01.171
- Where's yours?
- Right over there, man.

Are you fucking married?

- Oh, she isn't?

How stupid of me.
She was Hauser's wife?

How much is Cohaagen
paying you for this?

Think about it. Your dream started
in the middle of the implant procedure.

Everything after that,

Just as you specified.
Is that coincidence?

She's real. I dreamt about her
before I even went to Rekall.

Ha, Mr. Quaid.

She's real because you dreamed her?

That's why you tried to kill me.

I want you to come back to me.

764
01:03:30.922 --> 01:03:34.088
- Bullshit.
- What's bullshit, Mr. Quaid?


765
01:03:34.256 --> 01:03:36.088
That you're having
a paranoid episode


766
01:03:36.256 --> 01:03:38.838
triggered by acute
neurochemical trauma?


767
01:03:39.006 --> 01:03:42.880
Or that you're really an invincible
secret agent from Mars,


768
01:03:43.047 --> 01:03:47.088
who's the victim of an interplanetary
conspiracy to make him think


769
01:03:47.256 --> 01:03:49.171
he's a lowly construction worker?

770
01:03:56.756 --> 01:03:58.963
Stop punishing yourself, Doug.

771
01:03:59.131 --> 01:04:02.046
You're a fine, upstanding man.
You have a beautiful wife who loves you.


772
01:04:03.589 --> 01:04:05.546
- Your whole life is ahead of you.
- I do.


773
01:04:07.589 --> 01:04:10.171
But you've got to want
to return to reality.


774
01:04:12.547 --> 01:04:15.130
Let's assume I do. Then what?

775
01:04:18.047 --> 01:04:21.088
- Swallow this.
- What is it?


776
01:04:21.256 --> 01:04:24.463
It's a symbol of your desire
to return to reality.


777
01:04:25.381 --> 01:04:27.963
Inside your dream, you'll fall asleep.

778
01:04:31.589 --> 01:04:36.255
All right, let's say you're telling
the truth and this is all a dream.


779
01:04:36.422 --> 01:04:38.380
Then I could pull this trigger
and it won't matter.


780
01:04:38.547 --> 01:04:41.505
- Doug, don't.
- It won't make a difference to me.


781
01:04:41.672 --> 01:04:46.088
But the consequences to you would be
devastating. In your mind I'll be dead.


782
01:04:46.256 --> 01:04:49.546
With no one to guide you out,
you'll be stuck in permanent psychosis.


783
01:04:49.714 --> 01:04:51.921
Doug, let Dr Edgemar help you.

784
01:04:52.089 --> 01:04:54.171
The walls of reality
will come crashing down.


785
01:04:54.339 --> 01:04:56.505
One minute you'll be
the saviour of the rebel cause,

you'll be Cohaagen's bosom buddy.

You'll even have fantasies about
alien civilisations, as you requested,


788
01:05:04.381 --> 01:05:07.005
but in the end, back on earth
you'll be lobotomised!


789
01:05:09.547 --> 01:05:13.463
So get a grip on yourself, Doug,
and put down that gun!


790
01:05:19.131 --> 01:05:22.630
Good. Now take the pill
and put it in your mouth.


791
01:05:26.922 --> 01:05:29.046
Swallow it!

792

Go ahead, sweetheart.

Yes, you do.
That's why we brought you here.


922
01:18:36.214 --> 01:18:38.755
Cohaagen's big secret
is buried in that black hole


923
01:18:38.922 --> 01:18:40.963
you call a brain.

924
01:18:43.589 --> 01:18:45.380
And Kuato's gonna dig it out.

925
01:18:45.547 --> 01:18:48.296
- You're Kuato, right?
- Wrong.


926
01:18:49.089 --> 01:18:52.963
Kuato's a mutant,
so don't get upset when you see him.


927
01:18:57.589 --> 01:18:59.421
Ah!

928
01:19:31.506 --> 01:19:33.588
What do you want, Mr. Quaid?

929
01:19:34.672 --> 01:19:36.380
The same as you. To remember.

930
01:19:36.547 --> 01:19:38.713
But why?

931
01:19:39.339 --> 01:19:42.588
- To be myself again.
- You are what you do.


932
01:19:46.006 --> 01:19:49.213
A man is defined by his actions...

933
01:19:49.381 --> 01:19:51.505
not his memory.

934
01:19:52.672 --> 01:19:55.713
Please take my hands.

935
01:19:57.964 --> 01:19:59.796
Ah!

936
01:20:01.464 --> 01:20:03.921
Now open your mind to me.

937
01:20:05.047 --> 01:20:06.921
Please.

938
01:20:09.256 --> 01:20:11.963
Open your mind.

939
01:20:14.006 --> 01:20:16.505
Open your mind.

940
01:20:18.714 --> 01:20:22.380
Open your mind.

941
01:20:23.839 --> 01:20:27.505
Open your mind.

942
01:20:29.339 --> 01:20:32.963
Open your mind.

943
01:21:04.589 --> 01:21:06.838
We should blow the thing up
before the rebels turn it on.


944
01:21:07.006 --> 01:21:09.296
I say we throw the switch
and see what happens.


945
01:21:09.464 --> 01:21:11.421
- Don't be an idiot.
- We can't risk it.


946
01:21:11.589 --> 01:21:14.421
The chain reaction could spread
to all the terbinium in the planet.


947
01:21:14.589 --> 01:21:17.421
That means a meltdown,
a meltdown on a planetary scale.


948
01:21:17.589 --> 01:21:19.921
Don't you think whoever
built this thing thought of that?


949
01:21:20.089 --> 01:21:23.088
Who knows what the hell they thought?
They weren't human.


950
01:21:23.256 --> 01:21:25.713
Maybe it's a trap.
Maybe they want a meltdown.


951
01:21:25.881 --> 01:21:27.963
We don't even know
if this piece of junk will work.


952
01:21:28.131 --> 01:21:30.630
What is it?
A million? Half a million?


953
01:21:30.797 --> 01:21:33.755
- About half a million.
- Half a million years old.


954
01:21:33.922 --> 01:21:35.796
Let's make sure Kuato...

955
01:22:01.506 --> 01:22:03.255
(HEAVY RUMBLING)

956
01:22:06.714 --> 01:22:10.046
Wake up! Wake up!
Come on, wake up!


957
01:22:11.464 --> 01:22:14.005
They found us! Shit! Let's go!

958
01:22:15.256 --> 01:22:17.880
Wake up! Snap out of it now!
Come on!


959
01:22:22.131 --> 01:22:24.963
- They found us! Everybody out!
- Melina!


960
01:22:25.131 --> 01:22:26.963
KUATO: Get moving! Get out!

961
01:22:28.464 --> 01:22:30.130
Get out!

962
01:22:39.172 --> 01:22:41.213
Everybody out! Get out!

963
01:22:46.881 --> 01:22:49.171
Get to the air lock! Follow me!

964
01:22:50.964 --> 01:22:52.505
Benny, come on!

965
01:22:56.589 --> 01:22:59.255
- Benny!
- I'm coming!


966
01:23:11.381 --> 01:23:12.713
- Ah!
- This way!


967
01:23:18.422 --> 01:23:22.046
Put these spacesuits on!
We're going outside!


968
01:23:24.714 --> 01:23:26.713
Benny, hurry.

969
01:23:34.339 --> 01:23:38.338
Congratulations, Quaid.
You led us right to him.


970
01:23:38.506 --> 01:23:41.255
How can you do this?
You're a mutant.


971
01:23:42.547 --> 01:23:46.296
- I got four kids to feed.
- So what happened to number five?


972
01:23:48.214 --> 01:23:51.421
(LAUGHS) Oh, shit, man. You got me.

973
01:23:51.589 --> 01:23:53.171
I ain't even married.

974
01:23:53.339 --> 01:23:55.463
Now put your fucking hands
in the air!


975
01:24:01.256 --> 01:24:03.255
KUATO: Quaid.

976
01:24:04.839 --> 01:24:06.838
Quaid.

977
01:24:08.422 --> 01:24:12.005
Forget it, man.
His fortunetelling days are over.


978
01:24:14.714 --> 01:24:17.421
Start the reactor.

979
01:24:17.589 --> 01:24:19.421
Free Mars.

980
01:24:19.589 --> 01:24:20.921
(GUNSHOT)

981
01:24:24.589 --> 01:24:27.171
Mr. Cohaagen
would like to talk to you.


982
01:24:35.172 --> 01:24:37.963
So this is the great man.

983
01:24:42.506 --> 01:24:44.630
No wonder he kept out of sight.

984
01:24:46.589 --> 01:24:48.796
Well, my boy...

985
01:24:51.089 --> 01:24:53.005
- You're a hero.
- Fuck you.


986
01:24:53.172 --> 01:24:56.838
Uh? Don't be modest.
Kuato is dead.


987
01:24:57.006 --> 01:25:01.213
The resistance is completely wiped out,
and you were the key to the whole thing.


988
01:25:01.381 --> 01:25:02.713
He's lying.

989
01:25:03.714 --> 01:25:06.380
You two-faced bastard.

990
01:25:07.381 --> 01:25:11.213
Ha, ha. You can't blame him, angel.
He's innocent.


991
01:25:13.089 --> 01:25:16.921
You see, Quaid, none of my people
could get close to Kuato.


992
01:25:17.506 --> 01:25:20.255
Fucking mutants
could always sniff us out.


993
01:25:20.422 --> 01:25:24.505
So Hauser and I sat down
and invented you, the perfect mole.


994
01:25:24.672 --> 01:25:27.755
You know you're lying.
Hauser turned against you.


995
01:25:31.839 --> 01:25:33.588
That's what we wanted
you to think.


996
01:25:34.506 --> 01:25:37.671
The fact is, Hauser volunteered
to become Doug Quaid.


997
01:25:38.964 --> 01:25:40.796
It was the only way
to fool the psychics.


998
01:25:40.964 --> 01:25:42.421
Get your story straight.

999
01:25:42.589 --> 01:25:46.005
This idiot here has been trying to kill me
ever since I went to Rekall.


1000
01:25:46.172 --> 01:25:48.380
You don't kill somebody
you're trying to plant.


1001
01:25:48.547 --> 01:25:51.796
He wasn't in on it.
You set him off by going to Rekall.


1002
01:25:52.547 --> 01:25:55.380
- So why am I still alive?
- We gave you lots of help.


1003
01:25:55.547 --> 01:25:57.338
- Benny here.
- My pleasure, man.


1004
01:25:57.506 --> 01:26:01.005
The guy with the suitcase,
the mask, the money,


1005
01:26:01.172 --> 01:26:05.005
the message from Hauser,
all of that was set up by us.


1006
01:26:05.172 --> 01:26:07.588
Sorry. Too perfect.

1007
01:26:07.756 --> 01:26:09.338
Perfect, my ass!

1008
01:26:09.506 --> 01:26:12.088
You pop your memory cap
before we can activate you.


1009
01:26:12.256 --> 01:26:16.213
Richter goes hog-wild, screwing up
everything I spent a year planning.


1010
01:26:16.381 --> 01:26:20.130
Frankly, I'm amazed it worked.

1011
01:26:20.297 --> 01:26:21.630
Well, Cohaagen,

1012
01:26:21.797 --> 01:26:25.338
I have to hand it to you.
It's the best mind-fuck yet.


1013
01:26:26.672 --> 01:26:29.338
Well, don't take my word for it.

1014
01:26:31.172 --> 01:26:36.296
- Someone you trust wants to talk to you.
- Who is it this time? My mother?


1015
01:26:38.381 --> 01:26:39.713
<i>Howdy, Quaid.</i>

1016
01:26:39.881 --> 01:26:43.338
<i>If you're listening to this,
it means that Kuato is dead</i>


1017
01:26:43.506 --> 01:26:45.713
<i>and you have led us to him.</i>

1018
01:26:45.881 --> 01:26:47.838
<i>I knew you wouldn't let me down.</i>

1019
01:26:48.006 --> 01:26:52.630
<i>Sorry for the shit I've put you through,
but hey, what are friends for?</i>


1020
01:26:52.797 --> 01:26:56.005
<i>I would like to wish you
happiness and long life, old buddy,</i>


1021
01:26:56.172 --> 01:26:59.005
<i>but unfortunately,
this is not gonna happen.</i>


1022
01:26:59.172 --> 01:27:03.338
<i>You see, it's my body
you've got there and I want it back.</i>


1023
01:27:03.506 --> 01:27:07.630
<i>Sorry to be an Indian giver,
but I was here first.</i>


1024
01:27:07.797 --> 01:27:10.338
<i>So adios, amigo.</i>

1025
01:27:10.506 --> 01:27:13.630
<i>And thanks for not
getting yourself killed.</i>


1026
01:27:13.797 --> 01:27:16.380
<i>Hey, maybe we'll meet
in our dreams.</i>


1027
01:27:20.006 --> 01:27:22.005
<i>You never know.</i>

1028
01:27:26.672 --> 01:27:28.796
QUAID: You bastards!

1029
01:27:46.881 --> 01:27:48.380
Let go of me!

1030
01:28:04.506 --> 01:28:06.505
MAN #1: Ready?
MAN #2: Auto.


1031
01:28:06.672 --> 01:28:09.588
- Check.
- Ready to go, sir.


1032
01:28:11.589 --> 01:28:13.713
Relax, Quaid.

1033
01:28:13.881 --> 01:28:17.213
- You'll like being Hauser.
- The guy's a fucking asshole.


1034
01:28:17.381 --> 01:28:20.505
Not true.
He's one of my best friends.


1035
01:28:20.672 --> 01:28:23.505
Besides, he's got
a big house and a Mercedes.


1036
01:28:23.672 --> 01:28:27.630
And you like Melina, right?
You'll get to fuck her every night.


1037
01:28:27.797 --> 01:28:30.671
That's right.
She's going to be Hauser's babe.


1038
01:28:30.839 --> 01:28:33.005
I'll bust his balls.

1039
01:28:35.297 --> 01:28:37.505
Uh-uh, princess.

1040
01:28:37.672 --> 01:28:40.005
We're having you fixed.

1041
01:28:40.172 --> 01:28:43.338
You're going to be
respectful, compliant


1042
01:28:43.506 --> 01:28:46.921
and appreciative,
the way a woman should be.


1043
01:28:50.797 --> 01:28:52.880
Mr. Cohaagen, telephone.

1044
01:28:55.589 --> 01:28:57.213
Yes? What is it?

1045
01:28:57.381 --> 01:29:00.005
<i>The oxygen level
is bottoming out in Sector G.</i>


1046
01:29:00.172 --> 01:29:02.338
<i>What do you want me
to do about it?</i>


1047
01:29:02.506 --> 01:29:06.505
- Don't do anything.
- <i>But they won't last an hour, sir.</i>


1048
01:29:06.672 --> 01:29:09.046
Fuck 'em. it'll be a good lesson
to the others.


1049
01:29:09.214 --> 01:29:13.005
Come on, you got what you want.
Give these people air.


1050
01:29:13.172 --> 01:29:16.921
My friend, in five minutes
you won't give a shit about the people.


1051
01:29:17.089 --> 01:29:18.213
Fire it up, Doc.

1052
01:29:18.381 --> 01:29:20.421
Excuse me, Doctor.

1053
01:29:20.589 --> 01:29:22.630
- Is he gonna remember any of this?
- Not a thing.


1054
01:29:23.672 --> 01:29:24.880
Oh, really?

1055
01:29:35.381 --> 01:29:38.713
Quaid, I'm having a party tonight.
Why don't you and Melina drop by?


1056
01:29:38.881 --> 01:29:40.380
- Remind him, Doc.
- Sure.


1057
01:29:40.547 --> 01:29:42.130
See you at the party.

1058
01:29:56.797 --> 01:29:59.296
Keep still.
Fighting just makes it hurt.


1059
01:30:12.089 --> 01:30:14.880
If you don't keep still,
you'll end up psychotic.


1060
01:30:19.089 --> 01:30:20.588
Hey, don't!

1061
01:30:27.506 --> 01:30:29.171
Melina, hold on!

1062
01:30:52.089 --> 01:30:55.338
Are you all right?
Are you still you?


1063
01:30:55.506 --> 01:30:58.880
I'm not sure, dear.
What do you think?


1064
01:31:01.797 --> 01:31:04.171
Let's get the hell out of here.

1065
01:31:30.422 --> 01:31:32.755
You have to make a decision, sir.

1066
01:31:43.256 --> 01:31:44.546
Kill him.

1067
01:31:45.756 --> 01:31:47.755
It's about goddamn time.

1068
01:32:40.047 --> 01:32:42.671
- Where are you going?
- To the reactor.


1069
01:32:42.839 --> 01:32:46.463
- What reactor?
- The one in the mines. Come on!


1070
01:32:46.631 --> 01:32:50.588
People are dying, Quaid!
Stop! We've got to get air!


1071
01:32:50.756 --> 01:32:53.880
The reactor makes air.
That's Cohaagen's secret. Let's go.


1072
01:32:54.047 --> 01:32:55.463
Where's this reactor come from?

1073
01:32:55.631 --> 01:32:57.588
- Aliens built it.
- Aliens?


1074
01:32:57.756 --> 01:33:01.130
- Are you sure about this?
- It's just up ahead.


1075
01:33:03.756 --> 01:33:05.963
What the hell?

1076
01:33:29.422 --> 01:33:33.463
Quaid! Hey, Quaid,
you remember me?


1077
01:33:33.631 --> 01:33:35.880
Benny! Benny's the name!

1078
01:33:50.131 --> 01:33:51.630
Oh, that's good!

1079
01:33:57.422 --> 01:34:01.588
I'm gonna drill you, sucker!
I'm gonna grind you up!


1080
01:34:07.297 --> 01:34:10.546
Ha-ha! I'm coming!

1081
01:34:10.714 --> 01:34:12.546
I'm coming for you, baby!

1082
01:34:28.047 --> 01:34:30.088
What the fuck is this?

1083
01:34:36.631 --> 01:34:38.713
Damn this piece of Martian junk!

1084
01:34:41.131 --> 01:34:43.546
Hey, Quaid,
I'm gonna squash you!


1085
01:34:44.839 --> 01:34:46.713
Benny, here!

1086
01:34:49.922 --> 01:34:51.546
Where the fuck are you?

1087
01:34:57.214 --> 01:34:58.921
Screw you!

1088
01:35:05.047 --> 01:35:08.921
- Quaid, get over here!
- What is it?


1089
01:35:09.922 --> 01:35:13.713
- There's an opening.
- I knew it.


1090
01:35:42.547 --> 01:35:45.755
This whole thing is one big reactor
made out of terbinium.


1091
01:35:45.922 --> 01:35:49.171
Cohaagen knows it makes air.
The bastard won't turn it on.


1092
01:35:49.339 --> 01:35:53.630
Of course not. If Mars had
an atmosphere, he'd lose control.


1093
01:35:54.839 --> 01:35:56.213
See down there?

1094
01:35:57.339 --> 01:35:59.671
It's a glacier.

1095
01:35:59.839 --> 01:36:02.880
The whole core of Mars is ice.

1096
01:36:03.047 --> 01:36:07.255
The reactor melts it
and it releases the oxygen.


1097
01:36:07.422 --> 01:36:08.671
Come on.

1098
01:36:08.839 --> 01:36:11.755
- Enough for everyone to breathe?
- Sure.


1099
01:36:11.922 --> 01:36:14.755
Enough for the whole planet.

1100
01:36:14.922 --> 01:36:17.213
If we turn it on in time.

1101
01:36:23.839 --> 01:36:25.838
Come on. Come on!

1102
01:36:42.756 --> 01:36:44.005
Hold on.

1103
01:37:15.339 --> 01:37:16.213
Now!

1104
01:37:46.589 --> 01:37:47.838
Son of a bitch.

1105
01:37:55.714 --> 01:37:57.296
Move!

1106
01:38:00.131 --> 01:38:02.130
He's got a hologram!

1107
01:38:24.131 --> 01:38:26.838
You think this is
the real Quaid? It is.


1108
01:39:46.256 --> 01:39:48.505
You're coming with me!

1109
01:40:02.214 --> 01:40:04.421
See you at the party, Richter.

1110
01:40:42.714 --> 01:40:47.130
- Don't touch that! Get back!
- What are you afraid of?


1111
01:40:47.297 --> 01:40:49.588
- Turn it on.
- Impossible!


1112
01:40:49.756 --> 01:40:52.880
Once the reaction starts, it'll spread
to all the terbinium in the planet.


1113
01:40:53.047 --> 01:40:55.296
Mars will go into global meltdown.

1114
01:40:55.464 --> 01:40:57.963
That's why the aliens
never turned it on.


1115
01:40:58.131 --> 01:41:00.088
And you expect me to believe you?

1116
01:41:00.256 --> 01:41:04.880
Who gives a shit what you believe?
In 30 seconds you'll be dead.


1117
01:41:05.047 --> 01:41:08.255
Then I'll blow this place up
and be home in time for cornflakes.


1118
01:41:11.964 --> 01:41:15.921
I didn't want it to end this way.
I wanted Hauser back. But no.


1119
01:41:17.256 --> 01:41:19.255
You had to be Quaid!

1120
01:41:19.422 --> 01:41:21.755
- I am Quaid.
- You're nothing!


1121
01:41:21.922 --> 01:41:25.005
You're nobody!
You're a stupid dream.


1122
01:41:25.172 --> 01:41:29.130
Well, all dreams come to an end.

1123
01:42:43.922 --> 01:42:46.171
Melina, hold on!

1124
01:42:46.339 --> 01:42:49.880
Don't do it! We'll all die!

1125
01:42:50.839 --> 01:42:53.338
Everybody will die!

1126
01:43:56.422 --> 01:43:57.755
Quaid!

1127
01:44:28.089 --> 01:44:30.546
(GASPING AND GROANING)

1128
01:44:59.256 --> 01:45:01.713
(DISTANT, LOW RUMBLING)

1129
01:46:47.756 --> 01:46:50.213
(GASPING AND GROANING)

1130
01:49:12.589 --> 01:49:14.963
I can't believe it.
It's like a dream.


1131
01:49:16.297 --> 01:49:17.796
What's wrong?

1132
01:49:17.964 --> 01:49:21.796
I just had a terrible thought.
What if this is a dream?


1133
01:49:23.297 --> 01:49:26.380
Well, then kiss me quick
before you wake up.
