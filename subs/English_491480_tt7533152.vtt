MAN: [in English] <i>No one is responsible
for the death of this man.</i>


14
00:02:59.588 --> 00:03:04.255
God alone has decided
to take John Kamkwamba.


15
00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:10.921
When God has decided, then we will
know the man by what remains.


16
00:03:11.755 --> 00:03:14.835
By the fruit shall we know the tree.

17
00:03:14.838 --> 00:03:15.877
[murmurs of agreement]

18
00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:17.463
And we have fruit here.

19
00:03:18.296 --> 00:03:24.546
The fruit of the land farmed by John
and his younger brother, Trywell,


20
00:03:25.005 --> 00:03:28.421
since they returned from Dowa
nearly 20 years ago,


21
00:03:28.796 --> 00:03:32.460
and worked this land together
side by side, these two brothers.


22
00:03:32.463 --> 00:03:35.043
[murmurs of agreement]

23
00:03:35.046 --> 00:03:37.338
But there are other fruits
from John Kamkwamba,


24
00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:40.005
many offspring born to him.

25
00:03:40.463 --> 00:03:44.880
His children,
led by his eldest son, Jeremiah,


26
00:03:45.421 --> 00:03:48.838
who must now take over the work
of his departed father.


27
00:03:49.671 --> 00:03:53.668
And if the fruit is good, then it must...

William.

35
00:06:14.671 --> 00:06:15.911
[in Chichewa] Give me my radio.

36
00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:22.296
Did you fix Mr. Bamusi's?

37
00:06:23.213 --> 00:06:24.796
No, sir. Not yet.

38
00:06:26.546 --> 00:06:28.127
Go and check the roof.

[continuing indistinctly in Chichewa]

Bad dreams again?
Yes, hardly slept.

[dog barking]

52
00:08:02.255 --> 00:08:05.046
William! You want Shabani to help you?

53
00:08:05.921 --> 00:08:07.838
No, Ma. I'm fine.

54
00:08:09.838 --> 00:08:11.880
[in English] William, where's my radio?

55
00:08:13.755 --> 00:08:16.543
[in English] Mr. Bamusi, please,
just a few more days.


56
00:08:16.546 --> 00:08:18.585
I'm finding the problem.
It's not the condenser.


57
00:08:18.588 --> 00:08:21.668
I've told your father.
I'm missing my programs, William.


58
00:08:21.671 --> 00:08:23.585
William, if you can't fix it,

59
00:08:23.588 --> 00:08:25.713
you have to give Mr. Bamusi
back his money.


60
00:08:26.005 --> 00:08:28.043
A few days, Mr. Bamusi. I promise.

61
00:08:28.046 --> 00:08:31.460
He's forcing me to come back from work
and talk to my wife and children.


62
00:08:31.463 --> 00:08:32.960
[chuckles] William.

63
00:08:32.963 --> 00:08:35.627
[in Chichewa] Make sure you wash
before you go inside.


64
00:08:35.630 --> 00:08:36.630
[in Chichewa] Yes, Ma.

65
00:09:28.588 --> 00:09:30.921
WILLIAM: Papa! Papa!

66
00:09:31.213 --> 00:09:32.460
TRYWELL: Hey!

67
00:09:32.463 --> 00:09:34.463
[laughing]

68
00:09:36.546 --> 00:09:38.630
[in Chichewa] Thank you, Papa!
Thank you!


69
00:09:39.505 --> 00:09:43.877
Oh, my God! Where is my son?
Who has taken my son?


70
00:09:43.880 --> 00:09:46.210
Look at the trousers!
It's okay. It's okay.


71
00:09:46.213 --> 00:09:48.421
Who brought this man here?

72
00:09:49.005 --> 00:09:51.213
Doesn't he know that I love my husband?

73
00:09:51.463 --> 00:09:52.838
Leave the boy alone.

74
00:09:53.255 --> 00:09:57.171
Is he a doctor from Lilongwe
or an engineer from Chimamba?


75
00:09:57.421 --> 00:09:59.630
It's not too big?
It's perfect.


76
00:09:59.838 --> 00:10:01.505
Dear Father,

77
00:10:02.213 --> 00:10:06.463
we thank you for all the blessings
you have laid on this family.


78
00:10:07.338 --> 00:10:11.963
Please continue to fight for us,
so we may endure any hardship.


79
00:10:12.171 --> 00:10:14.171
In Jesus's name, Amen.
Amen.


80
00:10:21.255 --> 00:10:22.630
[chuckling]

81
00:10:23.796 --> 00:10:30.630
When I was a boy, the elders sometimes
hadn't recorded everyone's exact age.


82
00:10:31.046 --> 00:10:32.463
But there was a simple test.

83
00:10:33.713 --> 00:10:39.210
If you could touch your left ear
over your head with your right hand,


84
00:10:39.213 --> 00:10:41.130
you could go to school. [chuckles]

85
00:10:42.255 --> 00:10:45.338
The first time I tried, 
I was too small.

86
00:10:46.546 --> 00:10:47.546
I couldn't reach.

87
00:10:50.255 --> 00:10:51.255
Do it.

88
00:10:52.963 --> 00:10:55.460
That was for you to go
to primary school, Papa.


89
00:10:55.463 --> 00:10:56.880
[all chuckling]

90
00:10:58.005 --> 00:11:00.130
Of course I can do it.
I know.


91
00:11:03.713 --> 00:11:05.005
[laughs]

92
00:11:10.213 --> 00:11:11.213
Go to school.

93
00:11:11.838 --> 00:11:13.838
[indistinct chatter]

94
00:11:16.921 --> 00:11:17.921
Gilbert.

95
00:11:20.130 --> 00:11:21.130
Gilbert.

96
00:11:23.838 --> 00:11:25.338
Hey!
[both chuckling]


97
00:11:26.005 --> 00:11:28.671
[in English] Looking sharp, man.
You too, man. [laughs]


98
00:11:29.838 --> 00:11:31.588
[both chuckling]

99
00:11:31.713 --> 00:11:33.585
GILBERT: I think this is
a bit too loose for you.


100
00:11:33.588 --> 00:11:35.713
WILLIAM: Room to grow,
room to grow. [both laugh]


101
00:11:40.130 --> 00:11:42.171
[in Chichewa]
One phosphorus, one more organic.


102
00:11:42.588 --> 00:11:45.838
You want an ox cart?
No, I brought the bike.


103
00:11:48.296 --> 00:11:49.880
There's flooding in Mozambique.

104
00:11:50.880 --> 00:11:51.880
Mozambique?

105
00:11:53.088 --> 00:11:54.505
I've heard it on the radio.

106
00:11:54.796 --> 00:11:57.213
[women chatter indistinctly in Chichewa]

107
00:12:02.171 --> 00:12:06.088
[in Chichewa] Justina's relatives found
her a job at the agricultural ministry.


108
00:12:06.546 --> 00:12:07.880
Don't worry.

109
00:12:09.046 --> 00:12:15.296
After university,
you'll have no problem finding a job.


110
00:12:16.546 --> 00:12:21.380
You'll do things
even I didn't think women could do.


111
00:12:21.630 --> 00:12:26.921
[crowd chanting in Chichewa]
N.U.P. government! N.U.P. government!


112
00:12:27.130 --> 00:12:29.171
Another six months of this bullshit.

113
00:12:32.588 --> 00:12:35.296
You know the president
is even coming to Kasungu.


114
00:12:35.963 --> 00:12:37.963
[chanting continues]

115
00:12:39.005 --> 00:12:40.005
Democracy.

116
00:12:42.255 --> 00:12:44.713
Democracy is just like imported cassava.

117
00:12:48.463 --> 00:12:49.546
It rots quickly.

118
00:12:51.005 --> 00:12:53.046
[chanting continues]

119
00:13:25.171 --> 00:13:29.046
[in English] Of course, Kachokolo is not
the wealthiest school in the district,


120
00:13:29.171 --> 00:13:34.005
but it's down to each one of you
to decide your own level of commitment.


121
00:13:34.546 --> 00:13:37.296
Your own level of what?
PUPILS: Commitment!


122
00:13:43.380 --> 00:13:46.960
We have had students excel
in their junior certificate


123
00:13:46.963 --> 00:13:49.755
and some of them
have even gone on to university.


124
00:13:50.255 --> 00:13:52.002
Did these people have two heads?

125
00:13:52.005 --> 00:13:54.168
PUPILS: No, Mr. Headmaster.
[thunder rumbling]


126
00:13:54.171 --> 00:13:57.255
What did they not have?
PUPILS: Two heads!


127
00:13:58.130 --> 00:14:02.338
HEADMASTER: They worked hard.
Simple as that. What did they do?


128
00:14:02.546 --> 00:14:03.796
PUPILS: Worked hard.

129
00:14:03.963 --> 00:14:06.796
When we have received
the full payment for the term,


130
00:14:06.921 --> 00:14:09.921
you will receive your library card
from Mrs. Sikelo.


131
00:14:10.338 --> 00:14:12.130
[wind whistling]
What will I give you?


132
00:14:12.421 --> 00:14:14.130
PUPILS: Library cards.

133
00:14:14.755 --> 00:14:16.630
[thunder rumbling]

134
00:14:17.838 --> 00:14:21.796
Your library cards will allow you
to take some books home overnight.


135
00:14:22.046 --> 00:14:25.046
So, with dedication,
there's no reason...


136
00:14:25.213 --> 00:14:27.421
Everybody, go to your form rooms.

137
00:14:27.796 --> 00:14:31.460
Your form teachers will take you through
the rest of the day's activities.


138
00:14:31.463 --> 00:14:33.463
[excited shouts, chatter]

[rain drums on metal roof]

140
00:14:35.880 --> 00:14:38.671
MAN: Everybody, find your seat.
Find your seat.


141
00:14:44.046 --> 00:14:46.505
Your first day of school
and the rains have come.


142
00:14:46.713 --> 00:14:48.338
A good sign, I wonder.

143
00:14:48.546 --> 00:14:50.838
My name is Mr. Kachigunda.

144
00:14:52.380 --> 00:14:56.588
I will be your form tutor
and science teacher for the year.


145
00:14:56.713 --> 00:15:00.963
Good morning.
PUPILS: Good morning, Mr. Kachigunda.


146
00:15:01.255 --> 00:15:02.380
Take your seats.

147
00:15:03.130 --> 00:15:07.755
Okay, let's get right on with it.
Basic algebra: <i>X</i> and <i>Y.</i>


148
00:15:11.088 --> 00:15:12.128
[in Chichewa] Mr. Godsten.

149
00:15:12.796 --> 00:15:14.838
Mama said that Justina
left for Lilongwe.


150
00:15:15.380 --> 00:15:16.380
Yes, she's gone.

[thunder rumbles]

152
00:15:18.671 --> 00:15:20.296
Do you need help here?

153
00:15:21.463 --> 00:15:22.588
Not any we can afford.

154
00:15:23.255 --> 00:15:24.377

[murmurs in Chichewa]

156
00:15:25.963 --> 00:15:28.835
Will you let me know
if you hear of any work in the market?


157
00:15:28.838 --> 00:15:29.838
Of course.

00:15:46.963 --> 00:15:50.046
[in English] It's from my sister, Annie,
for her university placement.

00:15:52.130 --> 00:15:53.505
You're William Kamkwamba?

163
00:15:54.005 --> 00:15:55.005
Yes, sir.

164
00:15:58.380 --> 00:16:00.088
Tell your father to pay the fees.

165
00:16:01.546 --> 00:16:02.546
He's paid, sir.

166
00:16:03.213 --> 00:16:05.505
Only the down payment.
There's no grace period here.


167
00:16:06.671 --> 00:16:09.631
Tell your father to pay the rest or you
won't be allowed to come to school.


168
00:16:12.130 --> 00:16:13.546
Yes, sir. He'll pay, sir.

169
00:16:15.671 --> 00:16:16.671
Good.

170
00:16:22.755 --> 00:16:25.421
William, look who's been waiting.

[in Chichewa] William, it's too dark.

174
00:17:07.505 --> 00:17:08.963
We have a science test.

175
00:17:09.671 --> 00:17:13.421
Can I use kerosene?
There's not enough for studying.


176
00:17:14.421 --> 00:17:16.213
Go and help your father plant.

177
00:17:21.588 --> 00:17:22.796
[in English] That's okay.

178
00:17:23.838 --> 00:17:25.421
You need to see me after class.

179
00:17:26.505 --> 00:17:29.463
William, you can do better.
Gilbert, I'm not so sure.

That's good.

GILBERT: At least you passed.
WILLIAM: Sixty-two is not enough.


182
00:17:35.921 --> 00:17:39.463
We need to go to the junkyard.
We need to find a way to study at night.

GILBERT: Anything new?

187
00:18:12.671 --> 00:18:13.671
It's a pump.

192
00:18:39.338 --> 00:18:44.588
And then they took the trees to burn
to dry their tobacco leaves.

Who said you could come to the meeting?

200
00:19:07.546 --> 00:19:08.588
Gilbert is allowed.

Let the chief speak.

Of course, the estates know
that the rains came late this year,


208
00:19:27.963 --> 00:19:29.421
and they have come heavy.

209
00:19:29.713 --> 00:19:32.380
They know that there has been flooding
in Mozambique.


210
00:19:32.755 --> 00:19:37.088
They know that without finances,
we can't build proper defenses,


211
00:19:37.213 --> 00:19:39.046
and so we rely on the trees.

212
00:19:39.463 --> 00:19:43.130
They watch for every pressure
on us small people,


213
00:19:43.380 --> 00:19:45.046
so they can take from us.

214
00:19:46.963 --> 00:19:50.418
The only power we
have is to say no.

[scattered applause,

your father never sold them?

We'll make more money this way.

You keep spending your money
educating your kids,

when I have enough money to go,

251
00:21:44.963 --> 00:21:46.088
I'll give you my land.

252

I don't want your land.

253
00:21:55.130 --> 00:21:57.380
Then my father was right...

254
00:21:59.463 --> 00:22:00.630
not to leave it to you.

255
00:22:03.171 --> 00:22:05.005
There's nothing wrong with gambling.

316
00:28:06.380 --> 00:28:08.130
It's dead.
Let me check.


317
00:28:11.255 --> 00:28:13.713
Is that how
she was able to attend senior classes?


318
00:28:14.171 --> 00:28:15.171
What do you mean?

319
00:28:17.588 --> 00:28:18.588
He was her teacher.

320
00:28:20.213 --> 00:28:21.421
He must have helped her.

321
00:28:23.338 --> 00:28:25.585
That's why she got the grades
for university,


322
00:28:25.588 --> 00:28:28.005
and we're struggling even to get
a junior certificate.


323
00:28:29.338 --> 00:28:31.755
She got good grades
because she studied at night.


324
00:28:32.630 --> 00:28:35.255
I remember.
We had had money for kerosene back then.


325
00:28:40.213 --> 00:28:41.338
You could use this.

326
00:28:42.713 --> 00:28:43.755
To do what?

327
00:28:44.755 --> 00:28:47.921
If you break his bike, you think
he'll walk all the way to the village?


328
00:28:55.338 --> 00:28:56.838
It's this one.
Yeah, that's it.


329
00:29:02.838 --> 00:29:04.796
I can't.
Huh?


330
00:29:07.505 --> 00:29:08.588
Take the light.

331
00:29:09.463 --> 00:29:12.380
Take it, and then you'll
be able to study at night.


332
00:29:23.088 --> 00:29:24.213
It's not coming off.

333
00:29:39.713 --> 00:29:40.713
Turn the pedal.

334
00:29:51.046 --> 00:29:52.046
Stop.

335
00:29:57.338 --> 00:29:58.338
Start again.

336
00:30:32.463 --> 00:30:33.463
[whispers] Khamba.

337
00:30:43.963 --> 00:30:47.421
[in Chichewa] I had 5,200.
Is that everything?


338
00:30:50.296 --> 00:30:51.463
William's schooling?

339
00:30:53.005 --> 00:30:54.213
TRYWELL: After the harvest.

340
00:30:54.755 --> 00:30:56.546
MOTHER: He needs
schooling, Trywell.


341
00:30:57.255 --> 00:31:00.171
You want him spending time
with those useless boys?


342
00:31:01.630 --> 00:31:03.255
His mind is just like Annie's.

343
00:31:04.463 --> 00:31:08.838
Like my mother's.
TRYWELL: Your mother's? That mad woman.


344
00:31:09.671 --> 00:31:12.421
Was it madness
when she came and built the extension?


345
00:31:12.921 --> 00:31:15.671
Making bricks all day at her age
is what killed her.


346
00:31:16.713 --> 00:31:17.921
And we still use it.

347
00:31:19.463 --> 00:31:21.630
The children get it from her.

348
00:31:22.880 --> 00:31:23.880
From my side.

349
00:31:26.755 --> 00:31:27.755
Not from mine?

350
00:31:28.796 --> 00:31:32.213
You're clever enough.
You found me, didn't you?


351
00:31:33.296 --> 00:31:34.630
[both laugh]

352
00:31:36.546 --> 00:31:38.880
That was just luck. [chuckling]

353
00:31:40.046 --> 00:31:42.793
Just because you were
in the marketplace that time.


354
00:31:42.796 --> 00:31:43.880
[laughing]

355
00:31:48.671 --> 00:31:51.046
We need to save everything we can.

356
00:31:52.213 --> 00:31:53.880
There's no money for school fees.

357
00:31:55.171 --> 00:31:56.171
Not right now.

Kamkwamba, and Nkhoma.

If your name has been called,
please stay here.


363
00:32:27.796 --> 00:32:30.088
Everyone else, go to class.

364
00:32:44.880 --> 00:32:47.088
Your school fees have
still not been paid.


365
00:32:47.546 --> 00:32:49.005
There is no grace period.

366
00:32:50.213 --> 00:32:54.463
Please go home and collect the fees
if you wish to continue your studies.

Trywell.

370
00:34:07.255 --> 00:34:10.213
[in Chichewa] I'll go to the
auction house. I'll talk to Daniel Ngwata.


371
00:34:10.713 --> 00:34:11.713
Daniel?

372
00:34:13.255 --> 00:34:14.838
You haven't seen him for years.

373
00:34:15.880 --> 00:34:18.130
Maybe he can talk to the estate.

374
00:35:04.463 --> 00:35:06.463
[people chattering]

375

[in Chichewa]
How do you know this man, Papa?


376
00:35:15.171 --> 00:35:16.338
An old friend.

377
00:35:22.005 --> 00:35:23.005
MAN: Trywell.

378
00:35:24.505 --> 00:35:26.588
[in English] So long. Too long.
Good to see you.


379
00:35:26.713 --> 00:35:29.835
Is this big man William?
Wow. It's been too long.

[chuckling]

This way, please.

382
00:35:35.088 --> 00:35:39.380
I have some small savings
from when we were in business in Dowa.


383
00:35:40.255 --> 00:35:43.668
But I can use some of it
to buy back the trees on Kamkwamba land


384
00:35:43.671 --> 00:35:45.210
for the price they were bought for.

385
00:35:45.213 --> 00:35:46.293
They won't do that.

386
00:35:46.296 --> 00:35:49.505
No, if you tell them
the land is flooding.


387
00:35:51.338 --> 00:35:52.463
We're losing the harvest.

388
00:35:52.713 --> 00:35:56.463
Trywell, they won't do that.
Why would they do that?


389
00:35:59.463 --> 00:36:01.671
Jeremiah sold the trees.

390
00:36:03.671 --> 00:36:05.838
Why didn't your brother
leave you that land?


391
00:36:07.505 --> 00:36:09.921
You worked hard on that land.
I don't know.


392
00:36:10.755 --> 00:36:12.995
He should have left it to you
to take care of the family.


393
00:36:13.255 --> 00:36:20.130
It was John's land to leave
to whoever he wants to leave it to.


394
00:36:24.963 --> 00:36:26.505
The Pope. [laughing]

395
00:36:27.671 --> 00:36:28.671
The Pope.

396
00:36:29.463 --> 00:36:31.921
That's what we used to call your father
back then.


397
00:36:32.255 --> 00:36:35.046
The most honest man in
all of Dowa market.


398
00:36:36.463 --> 00:36:37.630
We used to laugh at him

399
00:36:37.838 --> 00:36:40.546
because what good can come
from an honest businessman?


400
00:36:41.463 --> 00:36:43.960
We used to laugh at him,
until he had carried off


401
00:36:43.963 --> 00:36:46.380
the most beautiful woman
in the whole place.

00:36:50.088 --> 00:36:51.128
[in Chichewa] For farming.

404
00:36:54.671 --> 00:36:55.921
[in English] How is Agnes?

405
00:37:03.546 --> 00:37:04.880
Can you help us, Daniel?

406
00:37:10.005 --> 00:37:11.171
[sighs]

407
00:37:15.380 --> 00:37:16.505
The rains, Trywell.

408
00:37:20.505 --> 00:37:22.588
What can anybody do about these rains?

409
00:37:23.838 --> 00:37:27.713
This year, the land is too wet.
Next year, too dry.


410
00:37:28.921 --> 00:37:30.546
You can't do business like that.

411
00:37:33.213 --> 00:37:35.671
All indications have been
that the grain harvest


412
00:37:35.796 --> 00:37:37.046
would be good this year.

413
00:37:37.380 --> 00:37:40.421
Even the International Monetary Fund,
the World Bank,


414
00:37:41.046 --> 00:37:43.460
told the government
to sell all the excess grain


415
00:37:43.463 --> 00:37:44.588
to Mozambique and Kenya.

416
00:37:45.755 --> 00:37:46.838
And so they did.

417
00:37:47.463 --> 00:37:49.588
Now what's happened?
The floods have come.


418
00:37:50.838 --> 00:37:53.418
And no one knows if there is
enough grain in this whole country


419
00:37:53.421 --> 00:37:54.838
to protect the farmers.

420
00:37:55.463 --> 00:37:57.463
The government will protect the farmers.

421
00:38:00.505 --> 00:38:02.755
Terrorists have attacked America.

422
00:38:04.421 --> 00:38:05.588
You must have heard it.

423
00:38:06.755 --> 00:38:08.421
All the markets are in free fall.

424
00:38:09.380 --> 00:38:11.963
All these government
debts being recalled.


425
00:38:15.588 --> 00:38:16.796
Forget about the trees.

426
00:38:18.630 --> 00:38:19.796
Forget about the savings.

427
00:38:21.796 --> 00:38:25.546
When these rains stop
and the sun returns,


428
00:38:26.505 --> 00:38:30.380
Malawi is preparing
for a very long hungry season.

434
00:39:17.546 --> 00:39:18.755
You could say something.

We can't threaten the president.

TRYWELL: [in Chichewa]
It's not threats.

We have to protect ourselves.

that we know what is happening.

will leave everyone here to die?

waiting to find out?


442

[in Chichewa] There was a

He saved a lot of people.

it doesn't get that bad again.

But it needs to charge.
It needs electricity.

With electricity, we can fix the pump.

00:42:23.880 --> 00:42:25.046
MR. KACHIGUNDA: William.

474
00:42:25.755 --> 00:42:28.755
When you turn the wheel on your bike,
the light shines.


475
00:42:29.546 --> 00:42:31.296
Yes.
How?


476
00:42:32.296 --> 00:42:33.380
A dynamo.

477
00:42:34.671 --> 00:42:36.713
How does a dynamo work?

478
00:42:37.088 --> 00:42:41.296
There's a little man on the inside
who rubs his hands together...


479
00:42:43.130 --> 00:42:44.671
It's, uh, magnets.

480
00:42:44.921 --> 00:42:48.421
Where can I find a dynamo?
You should try the trading center.


481
00:42:49.338 --> 00:42:52.505
I'm not sure if they'll have one there.
Mine came from Lilongwe.


482
00:42:52.963 --> 00:42:56.380
Well, what would I need to make one?

483
00:42:56.963 --> 00:42:59.421
I'm not sure exactly. A few things.

484
00:43:00.296 --> 00:43:04.213
Uh, a magnet, wiring,
something to break the magnetic field.


485
00:43:04.713 --> 00:43:07.088
If you try the library,
maybe you will find something there.


486
00:43:09.880 --> 00:43:11.296
I don't have a library card.

487
00:43:13.921 --> 00:43:15.630
Because your parents haven't paid.

488
00:43:19.463 --> 00:43:22.713
How do you know I will not tell Mr. Ofesi
that you're coming to my class?


489
00:43:26.796 --> 00:43:28.380
Because I can keep a secret, sir.

490
00:43:29.338 --> 00:43:30.338
A secret?

491
00:43:30.588 --> 00:43:31.588
Yes, sir.

492
00:43:33.421 --> 00:43:36.921
There is a man who comes to my village
to see my sister...


493
00:43:39.046 --> 00:43:40.046
sir.

494
00:43:45.880 --> 00:43:46.880
[knocking]

495
00:43:49.463 --> 00:43:51.338
WOMAN: Mr. Kachigunda.
Mrs. Sikelo.


496
00:43:52.505 --> 00:43:55.171
This is William Kamkwamba.
He's part of my science class.


497
00:43:56.005 --> 00:43:57.293
He's no longer a student here,

498
00:43:57.296 --> 00:43:59.585
but he and I have been working
on various experiments,


499
00:43:59.588 --> 00:44:02.148
and I'd like for him to continue
his studies here in the library.


500
00:44:07.630 --> 00:44:10.380
Does Mr. Ofesi know about this?
Of course.


501
00:44:10.671 --> 00:44:12.127
Mr. Ofesi's only stipulation

502
00:44:12.130 --> 00:44:16.380
is the boy is not to be taught or
assisted by you or any other teacher.


503
00:44:16.963 --> 00:44:19.252
It's important to him
that the boy working here


504
00:44:19.255 --> 00:44:20.463
is not common knowledge.

505
00:44:20.921 --> 00:44:23.713
He himself would prefer
not to be reminded of the fact.


506
00:44:25.380 --> 00:44:26.380
Of course.

507
00:44:28.005 --> 00:44:29.421
Good luck.
Thank you, sir.


508
00:44:32.255 --> 00:44:36.380
Perhaps you should sit
away from the window.


509
00:44:50.130 --> 00:44:51.130
Ms. Sikelo.

510
00:44:53.505 --> 00:44:54.671
Mr. Kamkwamba.

511
00:44:56.088 --> 00:44:58.671
Are there any books on dynamos?

512
00:44:59.088 --> 00:45:00.088
Dynamos?

513
00:45:01.338 --> 00:45:02.838
Magnets and electricity?

514
00:45:03.755 --> 00:45:05.171
Is this in your class grade?

515
00:45:07.713 --> 00:45:09.463
Maybe I can work with a dictionary.

516
00:45:09.588 --> 00:45:12.588
All the senior textbooks
are on the bottom shelf on the left.


517
00:45:51.630 --> 00:45:54.713
MRS. SIKELO: Mr. Kamkwamba?
Did you find what you were looking for?

[crowd cheering]
[rapid drumming]


519
00:46:46.213 --> 00:46:49.210
Welcome, Mr. President.
Thank you very much. How are you?


520
00:46:49.213 --> 00:46:50.880
[cheering continues]

521
00:47:01.671 --> 00:47:04.255
Thank you for coming Mr. President.
Welcome.


522
00:47:06.296 --> 00:47:08.671
[in Chichewa] Thank you, thank you.

523
00:47:09.046 --> 00:47:12.210
Clap your hands and cheer.

524

[crowd cheering]

525
00:47:14.713 --> 00:47:17.546
People, I'm saying N.U.P.

526
00:47:17.671 --> 00:47:19.421
CROWD: Government!

527
00:47:19.588 --> 00:47:22.130
Say it three times.

528
00:47:22.671 --> 00:47:27.210
CROWD: N.U.P.!
N.U.P.! N.U.P.! Government!


529
00:47:27.213 --> 00:47:29.213
[crowd cheering]

530
00:47:30.171 --> 00:47:33.505
[in English] Uh, but first of all,
I'd like to thank you, Your Excellency,


531
00:47:33.880 --> 00:47:36.838
for honoring the inauguration
of Chief Mamba.


532
00:47:36.963 --> 00:47:38.296
[cheers and applause]

533
00:47:38.921 --> 00:47:40.505
Can you please stand, Chief?

534
00:47:40.630 --> 00:47:43.046
Yeah! Yeah!

535
00:47:44.713 --> 00:47:47.168
[in Chichewa] And now I'll
leave the mic to Chief Wimbe.


536
00:47:47.171 --> 00:47:49.505

[crowd chanting in Chichewa]

538
00:48:02.130 --> 00:48:03.921
[in English] Your Excellency,

539
00:48:04.255 --> 00:48:09.380
may I first congratulate you
on your achievements in government,


540
00:48:09.630 --> 00:48:12.127
and state that I hope
in the coming election,


541
00:48:12.130 --> 00:48:14.088
you will emerge victorious.

542
00:48:14.296 --> 00:48:16.005
[cheers and applause]

543
00:48:18.171 --> 00:48:22.796
You have been a key factor
in our peace and stability,


544
00:48:24.213 --> 00:48:27.671
when we have seen
the responsibility of government


545
00:48:27.838 --> 00:48:30.793
devolve into chaos across Africa.

546
00:48:30.796 --> 00:48:32.796
[crowd cheering]

547
00:48:35.380 --> 00:48:39.088
However, the recent floods
have created a dangerous situation.


548
00:48:41.046 --> 00:48:45.005
In many regions,
we already know the harvest will fail.


549
00:48:45.296 --> 00:48:47.546
[shouts of agreement]

550
00:48:49.171 --> 00:48:54.255
We know the economic machinery
is not pointed towards us,


551
00:48:55.338 --> 00:48:58.296
but we are now a democracy.

552
00:48:58.671 --> 00:49:02.755
We are prepared to make our voices heard
in the ballot box.


553
00:49:03.671 --> 00:49:07.463
What is this man trying to do?
We need an assurance of emergency grain.


554
00:49:07.838 --> 00:49:13.335
We need to know any food issue
will be slaughtered in its infancy.


555
00:49:13.338 --> 00:49:15.752
[scattered shouts of approval]

556
00:49:15.755 --> 00:49:19.796
We need a government
prepared to support its people.


557
00:49:21.046 --> 00:49:24.255
I want to vote for this government,

558
00:49:25.796 --> 00:49:28.671
but cannot vote for any man

559
00:49:29.588 --> 00:49:33.213
who will turn two blind eyes
to a catastrophe.

MAN: Democracy at work.
Freedom of expression.


563
00:49:42.338 --> 00:49:45.880
Well, His Excellency
will address this misunderstanding,


564
00:49:46.713 --> 00:49:49.130
but for now, let's have some music.

00:51:33.255 --> 00:51:35.215
[in Chichewa]
Why don't they take him to a clinic?


579
00:51:35.546 --> 00:51:36.546
He's safer here.

580
00:51:38.171 --> 00:51:39.380
Would they come back?

00:51:39.671 --> 00:51:40.838
[sighs]

582
00:51:41.755 --> 00:51:43.338
We don't know.

583
00:51:45.755 --> 00:51:47.671
You have to be a man now, William.

584
00:51:49.713 --> 00:51:51.380
No one is coming to help us.

585
00:51:52.921 --> 00:51:54.921
I need you to work with me
on this harvest.


586
00:51:56.546 --> 00:51:58.505
For every piece of grain we can get.

587
00:52:01.505 --> 00:52:02.505
Yes, sir.

588
00:52:03.630 --> 00:52:04.630
MAN: Trywell.

589
00:52:35.546 --> 00:52:36.588
Thank you.

590
00:52:40.213 --> 00:52:41.796
[in Chichewa] Is that all there is?

591
00:52:42.630 --> 00:52:43.880
It's not even five bags.

592
00:52:44.921 --> 00:52:46.171
Sixty days.

593
00:52:47.588 --> 00:52:49.088
TRYWELL: Sixty to seventy.

594
00:52:50.421 --> 00:52:52.546
AGNES: With a year
till the next harvest.


595
00:52:53.463 --> 00:52:54.463
It's not enough.

596
00:52:55.338 --> 00:52:56.630
We have savings.

597
00:52:57.880 --> 00:52:58.880
Trywell.

598
00:52:59.880 --> 00:53:00.880
It's not enough.

[in Chichewa]
The government is denying a food crisis.


602
00:53:47.005 --> 00:53:48.005
What?

603
00:53:48.713 --> 00:53:52.085
They won't admit it's happening.

[indistinct arguing]

610
00:54:11.463 --> 00:54:13.918
There's an opposition
rally in Nkhata Bay.


611
00:54:13.921 --> 00:54:15.963
They're getting a truck.
Another rally?


612
00:54:16.213 --> 00:54:18.668
The opposition can put pressure
on the government.


613
00:54:18.671 --> 00:54:22.502
Where can we get the best price?
I'll take care of it.

00:54:22.505 --> 00:54:24.252
Uh-huh.
AGNES: You're going?

ANNIE: Papa!

616
00:54:25.171 --> 00:54:27.460
The government doesn't want us
to make noise.


617
00:54:27.463 --> 00:54:30.130
The opposition people need our support.

618
00:54:30.713 --> 00:54:34.380
Make noise here if you want to make noise.
Stay with your family.


619
00:54:34.630 --> 00:54:37.255
We'll be back tonight.
Tomorrow at the latest.


620
00:54:39.546 --> 00:54:42.213

MRS. SIKELO: [in English] So, you use
the windmill to charge the battery?


623
00:55:21.046 --> 00:55:22.546
And the battery powers a pump.

624
00:55:23.255 --> 00:55:26.213
We can plant in the dry season.
Two harvests.


625
00:55:26.880 --> 00:55:29.130
We can plant now
and we won't run out of food.


626
00:55:30.755 --> 00:55:33.046
With Mr. Kachigunda's
dynamo, I can do it.


627
00:55:36.588 --> 00:55:37.588
Go to his class.

628
00:55:38.546 --> 00:55:39.546
Ask him.

629
00:55:41.755 --> 00:55:44.171
I don't want you staying
in this village anymore.


630

Not with all of these problems.

00:55:47.630 --> 00:55:49.005
Where do you want me to go?

632
00:55:49.796 --> 00:55:51.130
I have people in Mangochi.

633
00:55:51.755 --> 00:55:55.213
We can travel there and marry.

634
00:56:00.921 --> 00:56:02.296
You want me to run away?

635
00:56:02.963 --> 00:56:05.002
You want me to disgrace my family?

636
00:56:05.005 --> 00:56:07.252
I love you. I don't know
what's more important than this.


637
00:56:07.255 --> 00:56:09.835
We can come back
when I can pay them a bride price.


638
00:56:09.838 --> 00:56:12.338
We'll do everything right then.
I promise.


639
00:56:16.463 --> 00:56:18.296
Can you pay them a bride price now?

640
00:56:21.171 --> 00:56:22.671
There's no money for teachers.

641
00:56:23.755 --> 00:56:26.380
So many students are leaving
because of the harvest.


642
00:56:27.338 --> 00:56:28.671
They may close the school.

643
00:56:29.296 --> 00:56:32.171
There's nothing here for us.
There's nothing in Wimbe.


644
00:56:32.546 --> 00:56:33.546
Nothing for you.

645
00:56:35.296 --> 00:56:38.213
You should go back to school.
I don't care about school.


646
00:56:39.755 --> 00:56:41.880
We can leave now. I can arrange it.
Annie.


647
00:56:42.713 --> 00:56:44.713
Annie.
How can I go to Mangochi?


648
00:56:45.380 --> 00:56:46.921
I can't even speak Yao.

649
00:56:47.880 --> 00:56:50.755
They speak English in Mangochi,
and you can learn Yao.


650
00:56:56.296 --> 00:56:59.338
[pupils murmuring indistinctly]

651
00:57:00.630 --> 00:57:03.921
MR. OFESI: Class, I'll be taking
your science lesson this morning.

00:57:10.171 --> 00:57:11.296
William Kamkwamba.

653
00:57:13.713 --> 00:57:14.713
Stand up.

654
00:57:18.421 --> 00:57:19.505
My father will pay, sir.

655
00:57:19.838 --> 00:57:24.168
You are stealing from the family of
every remaining student in this school.


656
00:57:24.171 --> 00:57:25.460
My father will pay, sir.

657
00:57:25.463 --> 00:57:28.630
You're stealing from myself
and from every member of faculty.


658
00:57:29.171 --> 00:57:30.171
My father will pay.

659
00:57:30.296 --> 00:57:31.880
You're expelled from Kachokolo,

660
00:57:32.088 --> 00:57:34.338
and you will never be allowed
to study here again


661
00:57:34.505 --> 00:57:36.088
or any school in this district.

662
00:57:36.546 --> 00:57:39.005
Collect your things and go.
Mr. Ofesi.


663
00:57:39.713 --> 00:57:40.880
Collect your things and go!

664
00:57:53.505 --> 00:57:55.838
MR. OFESI: <i>There's nothing
I can do about it, Mrs. Sikelo.</i>


665
00:57:55.963 --> 00:57:58.338
I cannot ignore him
sneaking into the school.


666
00:57:58.921 --> 00:58:02.255
But he was not sneaking into the school.

667
00:58:02.838 --> 00:58:04.088
Don't you see, Mr. Ofesi?

668
00:58:05.130 --> 00:58:08.463
Can you not see that he's been
sneaking out of the fields?


669
00:58:43.796 --> 00:58:45.755
AGNES: [in Chichewa]
Have you seen your sister?


670
00:58:46.588 --> 00:58:47.588
No.

671
00:58:49.130 --> 00:58:50.630
They caught you at school?

672
00:58:52.588 --> 00:58:55.171
You knew I was going?
Of course.


673
00:58:57.921 --> 00:58:58.921
They expelled me.

674
00:58:59.880 --> 00:59:00.880
AGNES: Oh!

675
00:59:01.380 --> 00:59:02.380
William.

[Agnes calling out in Chichewa]

What's happening? They're taking
grain to Chamama. To sell.

[panting]

680
00:59:24.921 --> 00:59:27.880
It's a government truck.
They're not leaving us to starve.

00:59:28.671 --> 00:59:30.671
[people shouting]

682
00:59:39.380 --> 00:59:42.046
Buy grain. As much as you can.

683
00:59:42.380 --> 00:59:45.960
It's government price, not market price.
It's cheaper.


684
00:59:45.963 --> 00:59:47.546
Aah! No, take the bike.

685
00:59:48.796 --> 00:59:50.671
Take the bike. [panting]

[in Chichewa] Where were you?
ANNIE: Seeing a friend.


696
01:01:26.505 --> 01:01:27.588
Which friend?

697
01:01:28.505 --> 01:01:30.838
You think I don't see you
sneaking out of here?


698

At night even?

699
01:01:33.255 --> 01:01:34.713
I've told you...
AGNES: I know.


700

What?

701
01:01:36.880 --> 01:01:38.463
There's no one for me in Wimbe.

702

There's nothing for me in Wimbe.

703
01:01:41.130 --> 01:01:44.713
So if there's nothing for me in Wimbe,
why should I stay in Wimbe?


704
01:01:44.838 --> 01:01:45.880

Who are you going with?
That's not what I'm saying.


707
01:02:06.921 --> 01:02:08.588
You want to disgrace your family?

You don't understand.

I need you to speak to Mr. Kachigunda.

I know you're talking to Mr. Kachigunda.

01:14:09.213 --> 01:14:11.213
I need to use
the dynamo from his bike.

The dynamo?
You have to help me, Annie.

Tell him he has to let
me use the dynamo.

01:14:17.338 --> 01:14:19.546
I can fix a water pump.
I know how to do it.


801
01:14:19.963 --> 01:14:21.880
I can bring water. 
I can make rain.

802

No.

that we would never pray for rain
like our ancestors.

In America, electricity made from wind.

01:28:48.421 --> 01:28:49.546
WILLIAM: [in english] Wait.

951
01:28:51.005 --> 01:28:52.963
[in Chichewa]
Come with us, William. Let's leave.


952
01:28:59.046 --> 01:29:00.213
WILLIAM: [in english] I can't.

953
01:29:09.005 --> 01:29:10.005
I have to go home.

954
01:29:11.213 --> 01:29:12.630
I need to be with my father.

955
01:29:35.171 --> 01:29:37.171
[wind howling]

956
01:30:20.630 --> 01:30:21.671
[in english] Khamba, come.

957
01:30:31.338 --> 01:30:32.338
Khamba.

958
01:30:45.046 --> 01:30:46.130
[voice trembles] Khamba.

TRYWELL: [in Chichewa]
<i>He tried to fight me,</i>


961
01:31:44.838 --> 01:31:45.838
with his friends,

962
01:31:46.671 --> 01:31:48.255
for the bike.

963
01:31:49.630 --> 01:31:50.963
Will you give it to him?

964
01:31:52.755 --> 01:31:53.880
Of course not.

965
01:32:14.963 --> 01:32:16.963
How much should I lose, Trywell?

966
01:32:20.171 --> 01:32:21.171
Huh?

967
01:32:22.796 --> 01:32:24.713
Everywhere I followed you,

968
01:32:25.796 --> 01:32:26.838
I lost something.

969
01:32:29.338 --> 01:32:30.338
My parents,

970
01:32:31.463 --> 01:32:32.880
when I came here.

971
01:32:35.296 --> 01:32:36.296
Then the land.

972
01:32:39.255 --> 01:32:40.296
Then we lost Annie.

973
01:32:43.505 --> 01:32:44.588
You're blaming me?

974
01:32:47.880 --> 01:32:50.046
I'm not blaming you.

975
01:32:52.671 --> 01:32:53.671
I'm asking you.

976
01:32:56.338 --> 01:32:59.421
When do we stop losing?

977
01:33:02.213 --> 01:33:04.046
Nothing we have done has worked.

978
01:33:58.588 --> 01:34:00.588
[bike rattling in distance]

979
01:34:24.046 --> 01:34:25.963
[in Chichewa] John said we'd grow tobacco.

980
01:34:29.255 --> 01:34:33.296
Tobacco that looked like milk chocolate,

981
01:34:35.713 --> 01:34:37.338
for 2,000 kwacha a kilo.

982
01:34:37.463 --> 01:34:38.463
[chuckles]

983
01:34:41.005 --> 01:34:42.005
I'm sorry, Papa.

984
01:34:43.963 --> 01:34:45.255
Sometimes it's dreams,

985
01:34:47.630 --> 01:34:49.588
and sometimes it's just lies.

986
01:34:52.005 --> 01:34:53.463
It's not a dream, Papa.

987
01:34:56.713 --> 01:34:58.046
I'm not dreaming.

988
01:35:03.046 --> 01:35:05.505
That's why he didn't
leave the land to me.


989
01:35:09.255 --> 01:35:10.671
He didn't trust me.

990
01:35:12.005 --> 01:35:13.005
He never did.

991
01:35:15.630 --> 01:35:18.588
He knew I'd fail.

992
01:35:20.380 --> 01:35:21.921
Like I have.

993
01:35:24.630 --> 01:35:27.588
You didn't fail me. Never.

994
01:35:29.171 --> 01:35:30.296
I went to school.

995
01:35:43.671 --> 01:35:44.713
Water?

996
01:35:46.296 --> 01:35:47.296
Yes, sir.

997
01:35:51.338 --> 01:35:52.338
From wind?

998
01:35:54.713 --> 01:35:55.921
It can work,

999
01:35:58.005 --> 01:35:59.421
if you help me.

1000
01:36:11.088 --> 01:36:12.088
Okay.

You can bring it up. I'm ready.


1005
01:38:00.505 --> 01:38:02.025
TRYWELL: [in Chichewa]
Have you got it?


1006
01:38:09.505 --> 01:38:10.630
Be careful, William.

1007
01:38:43.505 --> 01:38:45.505
[squeaking]

1008
01:39:42.755 --> 01:39:45.171
[in english] It needs to charge.
The battery needs to charge.

[indistinct chatter in Chichewa]

1014
01:41:05.838 --> 01:41:10.338
[in Chichewa] Go to the chief's house
and bring seeds. We'll plant vegetables.


1015
01:41:17.546 --> 01:41:20.671
We'll get through
while we wait for the grain to grow.

[in english] Go to them, Gilbert.

1023
01:44:30.296 --> 01:44:33.463
[in Chichewa] Mrs. Sikelo wants to bring
the new government's representative


1024
01:44:34.046 --> 01:44:36.255
for the schools district
to see the windmill.


1025
01:44:38.463 --> 01:44:41.380
She says there may be a scholarship
for a school in Madisi.


1026
01:44:44.921 --> 01:44:47.546
I think I should stay here.

1027
01:44:48.796 --> 01:44:52.421
At least till Annie comes back.

1028
01:44:53.088 --> 01:44:55.588
I think I should stay
and help you with the land.


1029
01:45:01.755 --> 01:45:04.005
I've been thinking about this machine,
William.


1030
01:45:06.588 --> 01:45:09.168
I've been thinking about
how it will carry you away


1031
01:45:09.171 --> 01:45:10.921
and keep you here at the same time.

1032
01:45:13.005 --> 01:45:15.755
Because no one can see this thing
and not think of you.


1033
01:45:17.338 --> 01:45:19.463
No one would want to.

1034
01:45:21.921 --> 01:45:23.380
Wherever you are.

1035
01:45:30.421 --> 01:45:31.421
Go to school.
