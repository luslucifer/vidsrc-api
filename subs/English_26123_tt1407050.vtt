What? Like, here? At the dance?

Well, there's always the library.

-Yeah, the library.
-I'm kidding.

and I don't know what your father
has told you about things,

but I think it's important to discuss
everything, you know?

00:17:21.958 --> 00:17:23.749
Like about sex.

-Mom, I don't wanna talk about this.

00:18:30.904 --> 00:18:34.439
and separating the ruined ones.
l'll be checking on you.

-Rob.

No. This is real. 
This goes back decades.

277

Okay. So what?

278
00:19:49.736 --> 00:19:52.310
This is exactly what we need
to finally get laid.


279

''She used a breath mint.''

the minty-ness makes your asshole twitch.

on the internet anyway.

to get laid been working out so far?

You know, I got so drunk last weekend

773
00:52:17.493 --> 00:52:20.936
that I nailed my cock to a table,
then set it on fire.

00:52:21.361 --> 00:52:22.867
Wanna check it out?

775
00:52:22.959 --> 00:52:24.848
The table or your cock?

God, I love that accent.

777
00:52:27.162 --> 00:52:29.003
Could you do me
a favour and just say,

778
00:52:29.096 --> 00:52:32.957
''Spank me, Stifler.
Spank me wee little bum.''

So where's this boyfriend Richard you keep
talking about non-stop all the time?


782

He doesn't attend high-school parties.

Sounds like you might be in the market
for some home-grown American beef.

just a little bit out of your league?

you've been at it for years.

in the cards for you.

I thought I had the answers.

960
01:03:32.267 --> 01:03:35.968
It's too bad that 99% of the bible's
completely unreadable.


961
01:03:37.899 --> 01:03:39.227
That's it.

962
01:03:39.944 --> 01:03:42.065
We need to reconstruct the bible.

963
01:03:42.152 --> 01:03:43.233
Why?

964
01:03:43.321 --> 01:03:44.732
The secrets are in there.

965
01:03:44.823 --> 01:03:47.739
I mean, there's no one single answer
to getting laid.


966
01:03:47.824 --> 01:03:49.782
Right? We need the whole book
to understand.


967
01:03:49.868 --> 01:03:51.945
Probably has a lot of crap in there
that we need to know, too,


968
01:03:52.037 --> 01:03:55.039
like positions, techniques,
angle of insertion.


969
01:03:55.124 --> 01:03:59.335
Exactly. That's what the bible was
created for, to help guys like us.


970
01:03:59.504 --> 01:04:02.623
And we owe it to the others.
I ruined the bible.


971
01:04:02.964 --> 01:04:05.502
I owe it to future generations
to restore its wisdom.


972

<i>I'm calling from</i>
<i>East Great Falls High School</i>


985
01:04:50.094 --> 01:04:54.139
NOAH: lt was the summer
of my junior year, 1969,


986
01:04:54.223 --> 01:04:56.975
and my buddies and I,
we take this trip to Amsterdam,


987
01:04:57.060 --> 01:05:00.974
where we run into a group
of semi-attractive Dutch nymphos


988
01:05:01.064 --> 01:05:05.274
who were willing to trade their bodies
for a handful of Jimi Hendrix LPs.


989
01:05:05.360 --> 01:05:09.856
Well, needless to say, we had ourselves
one super weekend with those gals,


990
01:05:10.073 --> 01:05:12.776
sexually speaking, if you get my drift.

991
01:05:13.576 --> 01:05:16.446
But the sad news was,
we had no idea what we were doing.


992
01:05:16.537 --> 01:05:18.281
We had no technique.

993
01:05:18.665 --> 01:05:21.416
And then one day, we were out sight-seeing,

994
01:05:21.500 --> 01:05:24.454
and we run into this Dutch hooker
in the red-light district,


995
01:05:24.545 --> 01:05:26.952
and she tells us about this book.

996
01:05:28.133 --> 01:05:33.174
It was a sex manual, evidently written
in the 19th century by some priest.


997
01:05:33.263 --> 01:05:35.634
Well, we read that thing cover to cover,

998
01:05:35.722 --> 01:05:38.178
and then when we got back
to East Great Falls,


999
01:05:38.266 --> 01:05:41.017
I had the bright idea
to write my own book

1000
01:05:41.102 --> 01:05:45.149
and add my own observations
and experiences and advice


1001
01:05:45.232 --> 01:05:49.147
and leave it in the library for some
other hapless virgin in the class below us.


1002
01:05:49.237 --> 01:05:53.315
But I had no idea it had been
passed down for 40 years.


1003
01:05:53.532 --> 01:05:56.154
Your book is a legend, 
Mr Levenstein.

1004

This is a real piece of history here.

1011
01:06:17.473 --> 01:06:19.264
What happened to it?

1012
01:06:19.432 --> 01:06:21.176
Well, that's why we're here.

1013
01:06:21.268 --> 01:06:22.513
The bible kinda got ruined,

1014
01:06:22.603 --> 01:06:26.552
so we wanna call everyone on the list
and try to reconstruct it.

Oh.

1016

Well, I think you boys might need
some help.


1017
01:06:35.949 --> 01:06:39.863
Well, girls have the advantage,
because girls talk to each other,


1018
01:06:39.952 --> 01:06:42.657
and don't kid yourself,
they talk about the penis.


1019
01:06:42.747 --> 01:06:46.162
Penis size, penis shape,
the angle of the bend.


1020
01:06:46.501 --> 01:06:48.209
Whether it winks at you. They talk.

1021
01:06:48.294 --> 01:06:52.209
Now, to really make love to a woman,
you gotta really care about her.


1022
01:06:52.298 --> 01:06:56.247
But... Hey, sex is great, but sex with
someone you love? That's awesome.


1023
01:06:56.342 --> 01:06:58.086

1024

Telling you.

1025
01:06:59.430 --> 01:07:01.303

of different food groups.

to a peanut-butter sandwich?

NOAH: Guys don't talk to each other

1039
01:07:32.504 --> 01:07:34.414
because they view each other
as competitors,


1040

which I think is crazy. You know?

I've been married 35 years
because I love my wife

01:09:48.344 --> 01:09:51.270
and I respect my wife.

1080

And whether it's Amsterdam
or East Great Falls,


1081
01:09:54.368 --> 01:09:56.081
it all comes down to this.

If you're honest and
treat a girl with respect,

then whatever happens is meant to happen,
because it's all perfectly natural.

the biggest test of your lives.

Thanks for the flowers.

1112
01:12:55.030 --> 01:12:58.479
I'm sorry about being a jerk.
And, for the record, I've learned my lesson.


1113
01:12:58.573 --> 01:13:01.526
I'm ready to respect you

I'm not in it just to have sex.


1116

Well, I realised that
I'm in this for you,

1117
01:13:13.206 --> 01:13:17.036
and if the pledge gets in the way of that,
then how good can it really be?

Sounds like a good basis for the two of us
to just relax and see what happens.

So you almost had sex with Stifler
so you'd be ready for me.


1235
01:22:00.359 --> 01:22:01.438
Yeah.

1236
01:22:02.361 --> 01:22:05.197
That's the dumbest thing I've ever heard.

1237
01:22:06.282 --> 01:22:08.856
Well, I heard you got some practise.

1238
01:22:09.536 --> 01:22:12.452
You know, the truth is,
is nothing happened.


1239
01:22:14.415 --> 01:22:17.202
l didn't want it
to be random like that.

1240
01:22:17.418 --> 01:22:18.618
And...

1241
01:22:21.381 --> 01:22:25.426
I couldn't picture my first time
being with anybody else but you.


1242
01:22:45.907 --> 01:22:47.401
What was that?

1243
01:22:48.159 --> 01:22:49.784
I don't know.

1244
01:22:53.122 --> 01:22:55.080
-Looks like we're stuck.
-Yeah.


1245
01:23:01.005 --> 01:23:04.339
You know, we could be
up here for a while.

1246
01:23:04.424 --> 01:23:05.505
Yeah.

1247
01:23:31.621 --> 01:23:33.412
LUBE: Hey, can I ask you a question?

1248
01:23:33.498 --> 01:23:35.205
Yeah, sure. Whatever.

1249
01:23:35.290 --> 01:23:37.829
Why do you hook up with assholes
like Scott Stifler anyway?


1250
01:23:37.918 --> 01:23:40.208
Excuse me, but you don't know me.

1251
01:23:40.296 --> 01:23:43.463
(SCOFFS) You know,
you're just the same as all the rest.


1252
01:23:43.549 --> 01:23:44.711
I'm just some sort of trophy to you.

1253
01:23:44.801 --> 01:23:47.258
You don't care about me.
You just wanna sleep with me,


1254
01:23:47.345 --> 01:23:50.180
because you think
it's some sort of status symbol.


1255
01:23:50.264 --> 01:23:51.427
Sorry.

How long are we gonna be up here?

l'll get help.

ASHLEY: What are you doing?

1261
01:24:05.323 --> 01:24:08.074
It's not that far down,
and there's, like, 20 feet of snow.


1262
01:24:08.158 --> 01:24:10.151
What, is this supposed to impress me?

1263
01:24:10.246 --> 01:24:12.283
The thought had crossed my mind.

1264
01:24:12.373 --> 01:24:14.446
Absolutely not. 
First of all, it's just wrong.

1265
01:24:14.541 --> 01:24:16.829
Second of all,
you're not even supposed to touch the door.


1266
01:24:16.918 --> 01:24:21.164
And third, it's just really dangerous, okay?
So just get away from there.


1267
01:24:21.255 --> 01:24:23.710
Right. What was I thinking?

1268
01:24:27.636 --> 01:24:28.717
Whoa!

(ASHLEY SCREAMING)

1270
01:24:32.225 --> 01:24:33.601
Are you okay?

1271
01:24:33.684 --> 01:24:35.181
I think I hurt my leg.

1273
01:24:36.730 --> 01:24:37.844
Idiot.

1274

Are you okay?

1275
01:24:55.624 --> 01:24:57.167
Are you crazy?

1276
01:24:58.335 --> 01:24:59.796
Are you okay?

1277
01:25:00.422 --> 01:25:03.626
Yeah, I'm fine. No, I'm fine. I'm fine.

1278
01:25:03.717 --> 01:25:07.251
About what you said
about how I don't care about you


1279
01:25:07.345 --> 01:25:10.098
and you're just a trophy,
that's actually not true.


1280
01:25:10.181 --> 01:25:14.725
l really like you.
We went to elementary school together.


1281
01:25:15.021 --> 01:25:18.188
I remember when you sang <i>Hey Ya!</i>
in the sixth-grade talent show.


1282
01:25:18.273 --> 01:25:22.403
I remember when you fell off the pyramid
at the homecoming game, freshman year.


1283
01:25:22.486 --> 01:25:25.357
You were so embarrassed, but I didn't care.

1284
01:25:25.530 --> 01:25:29.231
I just liked how you played it off
like it was all part of the routine.


1285
01:25:29.326 --> 01:25:35.912
I mean, yeah, sure, you're a super-hot babe,
but I actually like you for you.


1286
01:25:38.087 --> 01:25:40.790
Look, this may be a shock to you,

1287
01:25:40.880 --> 01:25:45.128
but I have no idea
what I'm doing with girls.

1288
01:25:46.679 --> 01:25:50.012
But I really wanna learn.
You just give me a chance.


1289
01:25:50.934 --> 01:25:52.806
That's all I'm asking.

1290
01:25:53.518 --> 01:25:57.516
And I guarantee that
l will make it my life's mission


1291
01:25:57.606 --> 01:26:00.941
to satisfy you in every way possible.

1292
01:26:37.566 --> 01:26:40.185
-Let's go back to the...
-to the cabin.


1293

Dude. You forgot to sign it.

1294
01:27:47.803 --> 01:27:50.378
You sure we can't just keep it
for one more year?


1295
01:27:50.474 --> 01:27:52.466
No, guys, it's someone else's turn.
