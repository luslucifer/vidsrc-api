1
00:00:32.531 --> 00:00:33.531
Can you stop that?

2
00:00:33.532 --> 00:00:35.274
I can't think of questions.

3
00:00:42.274 --> 00:00:44.242
You're not gonna
get sunburned, Matt.


4
00:00:44.243 --> 00:00:45.250
Just...
Just relax.


5
00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:52.917
- Anything.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah...


6
00:00:52.918 --> 00:00:55.753
Hold on, hold on!
Let me think of it.


7
00:00:55.754 --> 00:00:57.622
Umm.

8
00:00:57.623 --> 00:00:58.689
Do you...?

9
00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:00.558
Do you ever get..?
I mean...


10
00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:02.993
On tour,
it's day in and day out.


11
00:01:02.994 --> 00:01:03.995
Umm.

12
00:01:03.996 --> 00:01:05.329
Do you ever get...?

13
00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:08.466
Does that ever make you
sleepy on stage?


14
00:01:08.467 --> 00:01:10.501
Umm.
Or tired?


15
00:01:10.502 --> 00:01:13.304
Tired on stage?
That's my question.


16
00:01:13.305 --> 00:01:14.906
Question number one is that.

17
00:01:14.907 --> 00:01:20.611
Have you ever woken up
in a nightmare, on a bus?


18
00:01:20.612 --> 00:01:21.679
Because the movement.

19
00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:22.747
What kind of nightmares,

20
00:01:22.748 --> 00:01:24.482
have people talked about
of having?


21
00:01:24.483 --> 00:01:26.617
Don't act like
it was a dumb question!


22
00:01:26.618 --> 00:01:28.719
I'm following up
on my first question!


23
00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:29.720
Do you have a notebook?

24
00:01:29.721 --> 00:01:32.958
With questions
written down that you, like...


25
00:01:33.958 --> 00:01:36.727
Do you have any
kind of organization and plan


26
00:01:36.728 --> 00:01:38.304
for this film?

27
00:01:45.304 --> 00:01:46.571
<i>Our guests today in the studio</i>

28
00:01:46.572 --> 00:01:48.206
<i>are The National.</i>

29
00:01:48.207 --> 00:01:49.207
<i>We're about to talk
to a band called The National.</i>


30
00:01:49.208 --> 00:01:50.007
<i>They've been critical darlings,</i>

31
00:01:50.008 --> 00:01:52.008
<i>for the last ten years or so;</i>

32
00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:53.578
<i>but now they are
finally achieving</i>


33
00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:55.713
<i>some commercial success.</i>

34
00:01:55.714 --> 00:01:57.081
<i>Yes, the secret is out.</i>

35
00:01:57.082 --> 00:01:58.583
<i>This is one of the most
talked about bands</i>


36
00:01:58.584 --> 00:01:59.917
<i>on the planet right now.</i>

37
00:01:59.918 --> 00:02:01.719
<i>Please welcome to the program,</i>

38
00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:02.754
The National.

39
00:02:02.755 --> 00:02:04.155
<i>Your applause for...
The National.</i>


40
00:02:05.057 --> 00:02:06.591
You're the smartest dressed band

41
00:02:06.592 --> 00:02:07.390
on the red carpet today.

42
00:02:07.391 --> 00:02:08.592
Are we?

43
00:02:08.593 --> 00:02:09.426
Maybe we...?
Did we over do it?


44
00:02:09.427 --> 00:02:10.728
No, not at all.

45
00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:12.330
This is our first red carpet,

46
00:02:12.331 --> 00:02:14.831
so you are going to see
a lot of waistcoats.


47
00:02:14.832 --> 00:02:16.533
<i>So the new record is blowing up.</i>

48
00:02:16.534 --> 00:02:17.769
<i>Number three on the charts.</i>

49
00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:21.639
<i>And you've been profiled
in Rolling Stone, GQ.</i>


50
00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:22.806
<i>You were recently the subject</i>

51
00:02:22.807 --> 00:02:26.544
<i>of a ten-page spread
in the New York Times.</i>


52
00:02:26.545 --> 00:02:28.778
<i>The Times piece mentions you
guys are a band of brothers.</i>


53
00:02:28.779 --> 00:02:30.014
<i>Two sets of brothers.</i>

54
00:02:30.015 --> 00:02:31.081
<i>Bryan and Scott are brothers.</i>

55
00:02:31.082 --> 00:02:34.718
<i>And Aaron and Bryce
are twins actually.</i>


56
00:02:34.719 --> 00:02:36.721
<i>But then, there's you, Matt.</i>

57
00:02:36.722 --> 00:02:38.855
<i>You're the guy in the band
who doesn't have a brother.</i>


58
00:02:38.856 --> 00:02:41.391
I... I do have a brother.

59
00:02:41.392 --> 00:02:45.562
Um. But he's nine years
younger and lives in Cincinnati.


60
00:02:45.563 --> 00:02:47.203
<i>What does your brother
think of the band?</i>


61
00:02:48.933 --> 00:02:49.933
Aaaa?

62
00:02:49.934 --> 00:02:51.102
That's a good ques-
- Aaa?

63
00:02:51.103 --> 00:02:54.572
I don't think he does think
of it that much actually.


64
00:02:54.573 --> 00:02:57.574
He's more of a metal head.

65
00:02:57.575 --> 00:02:59.710
So... I think he thinks,

66
00:02:59.711 --> 00:03:01.964
Indie rock
is pretentious bullshit.


67
00:03:19.964 --> 00:03:22.599
And here we are.

68
00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:26.637
That's me, my sister,
my dad, and my mom.


69
00:03:26.638 --> 00:03:28.605
And there's Matt.

70
00:03:28.606 --> 00:03:30.574
And this was
at our grandma's funeral.


71
00:03:30.575 --> 00:03:32.009
And uh... I don't know?

72
00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:33.616
I'm looking pretty good there.

73
00:03:37.616 --> 00:03:40.617
Two weeks ago, Matt called.

74
00:03:40.618 --> 00:03:43.554
He said the band is ready
to go out on tour again.


75
00:03:43.555 --> 00:03:46.056
And they're going to need
extra help.


76
00:03:46.057 --> 00:03:48.192
So he asked if
I wanted to go on tour


77
00:03:48.193 --> 00:03:49.597
and be a roadie.

78
00:03:51.597 --> 00:03:53.030
A year on tour with my brother,

79
00:03:53.031 --> 00:03:54.465
I think, is going to be awesome.

80
00:03:54.466 --> 00:03:57.001
I don't ever
get to see him so...


81
00:03:57.002 --> 00:03:59.604
I think it's going to be fun.

82
00:03:59.605 --> 00:04:00.805
I'm taking a camera along

83
00:04:00.806 --> 00:04:03.674
to make a documentary
on the band.


84
00:04:03.675 --> 00:04:04.875
Making movies is something

85
00:04:04.876 --> 00:04:06.777
I've always really loved to do.

86
00:04:06.778 --> 00:04:10.214
A Primarily
horror-action movies.


87
00:04:10.215 --> 00:04:12.685
<i>It's not The National but...</i>

88
00:04:14.685 --> 00:04:16.087
This is my first movie,

89
00:04:16.088 --> 00:04:19.190
<i>From The Dirt Under His Nails.</i>

90
00:04:19.191 --> 00:04:21.491
It's about an insane
animal trapper


91
00:04:21.492 --> 00:04:23.994
who resurrects from the dead.

92
00:04:23.995 --> 00:04:27.664
And goes on a rampage.

93
00:04:27.665 --> 00:04:32.703
<i>And this one is Wages Of Sin!</i>

94
00:04:32.704 --> 00:04:37.041
This one's about a barbarian
with an identity crisis,


95
00:04:37.042 --> 00:04:40.148
who also goes through
a murderous rampage.


96
00:04:43.148 --> 00:04:45.015
I'm filming down here!

97
00:04:45.016 --> 00:04:47.150
Oh. I didn't know
that, sorry.


98
00:04:47.151 --> 00:04:49.720
I don't leave until
eight o' clock tomorrow night.


99
00:04:49.721 --> 00:04:51.257
Okay.

100
00:05:10.809 --> 00:05:12.275
Hi.

101
00:05:12.276 --> 00:05:15.279
Hey, we were just talking
to the fella upstairs.


102
00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:16.580
We're just making
a small documentary


103
00:05:16.581 --> 00:05:17.580
<i>on The National.</i>

104
00:05:17.581 --> 00:05:20.717
He said it was okay
if we do a little shooting.


105
00:05:20.718 --> 00:05:22.127
- Okay.
- Alright. Thank you.


106
00:05:29.127 --> 00:05:31.529
<i>Have you ever heard of
The National?</i>


107
00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:32.796
They're from here.

108
00:05:32.797 --> 00:05:33.998
Right. Right.

109
00:05:33.999 --> 00:05:36.002
I'm his brother
and I'm about to go on tour.


110
00:05:38.002 --> 00:05:41.905
Have you ever been on a tour bus
or anything like that?


111
00:05:41.906 --> 00:05:43.708
- No.
- I'm supposed to go on their tour bus,


112
00:05:43.709 --> 00:05:47.912
and I don't know what to expect.

113
00:05:47.913 --> 00:05:49.880
I think I'm going to
get together with him.


114
00:05:49.881 --> 00:05:51.649
I'm going to be making
this rock doc.


115
00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:53.966
I thank you for letting me
into your beautiful store.


116
00:06:08.966 --> 00:06:09.967
Hey!

117
00:06:09.968 --> 00:06:11.937
Hey!

118
00:06:12.937 --> 00:06:13.937
How's it going?

119
00:06:13.939 --> 00:06:14.938
Good. Good.

120
00:06:14.939 --> 00:06:15.974
Like my new camera?

121
00:06:15.975 --> 00:06:17.140
You're not supposed to
do that in here.


122
00:06:17.141 --> 00:06:18.042
I know. I know.

123
00:06:18.043 --> 00:06:21.645
Hey, guys! Good,
the whole band is here.


124
00:06:21.646 --> 00:06:24.013
It's about to be confiscated
by the TSA.


125
00:06:24.014 --> 00:06:25.316
No, it's not.

126
00:06:25.317 --> 00:06:26.660
I don't think so?

127
00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:38.831
Your cord's touching me.

128
00:06:39.831 --> 00:06:42.018
I had no idea you've never
been to Europe.


129
00:07:00.018 --> 00:07:01.284
Welcome to Paris!

130
00:07:01.285 --> 00:07:03.888
Oooh! This doesn't even
look like my arm!


131
00:07:03.889 --> 00:07:04.989
Looks like another--
oh, there we go.


132
00:07:04.990 --> 00:07:07.291
Looks like another person
in the room when I do this.


133
00:07:07.292 --> 00:07:08.860
Who is that?

134
00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:12.763
I'm... This is cool.

135
00:07:12.764 --> 00:07:14.298
I'm psyched you are here.

136
00:07:14.299 --> 00:07:16.734
It's good to be here.

137
00:07:16.735 --> 00:07:20.703
<i>We have. We've been here--</i>

138
00:07:20.704 --> 00:07:22.405
Matt is on a phone interview

139
00:07:22.406 --> 00:07:26.309
with a French newspaper.

140
00:07:26.310 --> 00:07:29.647
Talking,
So let's just listen in.


141
00:07:29.648 --> 00:07:31.381
<i>In fact, it was
our first show in Europe.</i>


142
00:07:31.382 --> 00:07:32.650
<i>It was a hundred people.</i>

143
00:07:32.651 --> 00:07:35.719
<i>But it was our first taste
of what it would be like</i>


144
00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:38.255
<i>to be a real band, I think.</i>

145
00:07:38.256 --> 00:07:40.724
<i>We all are
in a really weird moods</i>


146
00:07:40.725 --> 00:07:42.426
<i>just 'cause we're nervous.</i>

147
00:07:42.427 --> 00:07:46.363
<i>That has never gone away.</i>

148
00:07:46.364 --> 00:07:50.234
<i>We've learned to channel, I
think, whatever anxieties we have</i>


149
00:07:50.235 --> 00:07:52.944
<i>into just the songs, I guess.</i>

150
00:07:58.944 --> 00:08:03.283
Stop. How fast can you play?

151
00:08:06.283 --> 00:08:07.684
Well, who's faster?

152
00:08:07.685 --> 00:08:09.352
Should I go to Bryce for this?

153
00:08:09.353 --> 00:08:11.989
Who's faster, you or Bryce?

154
00:08:11.990 --> 00:08:15.025
Well, if I play
with my fingers in scales,


155
00:08:15.026 --> 00:08:16.926
I can play pretty fast.

156
00:08:16.927 --> 00:08:19.796
But Bryce is
the faster guitarist?


157
00:08:19.797 --> 00:08:22.299
Technically, yeah.

158
00:08:22.300 --> 00:08:25.768
Do you want me to turn around?

159
00:08:25.769 --> 00:08:27.241
Actually, bend down and come up.

160
00:08:29.241 --> 00:08:30.911
Yeah.

161
00:08:33.131 --> 00:08:35.011
Now act like you're
just picking up your glasses


162
00:08:35.012 --> 00:08:37.347
and not even paying
attention to me.


163
00:08:37.348 --> 00:08:38.415
No, this is good.

164
00:08:38.416 --> 00:08:40.785
This is going to be
perfect for your intro shot.


165
00:08:41.785 --> 00:08:42.785
Yeah.

166
00:09:14.031 --> 00:09:14.952
Like, basically I have,

167
00:09:14.953 --> 00:09:16.819
your job description right here.

168
00:09:16.820 --> 00:09:17.987
You've seen the rider, right?

169
00:09:17.988 --> 00:09:19.188
Uh-huh. No.

170
00:09:19.189 --> 00:09:22.226
No I haven't actually.

171
00:09:22.227 --> 00:09:23.327
I thought I emailed it to you?

172
00:09:23.328 --> 00:09:24.328
But, regardless...

173
00:09:24.930 --> 00:09:26.230
Oh. Okay.

174
00:09:26.231 --> 00:09:27.831
Maybe I did see that.
Yeah.


175
00:09:27.832 --> 00:09:29.232
It's basically
just a list of food.


176
00:09:29.233 --> 00:09:30.467
Okay.

177
00:09:30.468 --> 00:09:32.535
I just want you to
make sure that it's all there.


178
00:09:32.536 --> 00:09:33.670
Okay.

179
00:09:33.671 --> 00:09:34.704
I'd like to
say it is simple, but it's not.


180
00:09:34.705 --> 00:09:37.006
Is there anything,
like, in particular


181
00:09:37.007 --> 00:09:38.042
for, like, Bryce or Aaron?

182
00:09:38.043 --> 00:09:38.842
Well, you know them well enough

183
00:09:38.843 --> 00:09:41.145
- to figure that out.
- Yeah. Okay.


184
00:09:41.146 --> 00:09:43.047
You know, just moving down
the list,


185
00:09:43.048 --> 00:09:44.314
as far as the show time
is concerned,


186
00:09:44.315 --> 00:09:46.250
you need to assemble the band

187
00:09:46.251 --> 00:09:47.851
five minutes before the show.

188
00:09:47.852 --> 00:09:49.053
So you got to make sure

189
00:09:49.054 --> 00:09:51.155
everybody's gone
to the bathroom, you know.


190
00:09:51.156 --> 00:09:53.289
Bryan's usually in
the bathroom for, like, forever.


191
00:09:53.290 --> 00:09:54.290
And then during the show,

192
00:09:54.959 --> 00:09:57.227
I just want you to stay
on radio communication.


193
00:09:57.228 --> 00:09:58.429
Okay?

194
00:09:58.430 --> 00:09:59.362
So, I just want you to make sure

195
00:09:59.363 --> 00:10:00.497
you're available,

196
00:10:00.498 --> 00:10:03.299
in the event that something
horribly wrong goes down.


197
00:10:03.300 --> 00:10:07.004
Why I'm saying that,
is because you're here,


198
00:10:07.005 --> 00:10:09.472
because we need someone
to do this stuff.


199
00:10:09.473 --> 00:10:11.475
- Right.
- And, you know,


200
00:10:11.476 --> 00:10:13.242
you just need to be
careful about...


201
00:10:13.243 --> 00:10:15.478
not partying.

202
00:10:15.479 --> 00:10:17.079
And, you know,
you're not a band member,


203
00:10:17.949 --> 00:10:19.583
you're a crew member.

204
00:10:19.584 --> 00:10:22.290
- Right.
- This shit has to get done.


205
00:10:25.290 --> 00:10:26.900
Don't step backwards.

206
00:10:35.900 --> 00:10:36.900
Hey, Tom. I can't do this

207
00:10:36.934 --> 00:10:37.834
right now, dude.

208
00:10:37.835 --> 00:10:40.440
You got
to leave me alone. Seriously.


209
00:10:43.440 --> 00:10:45.275
Can you stop!

210
00:10:45.276 --> 00:10:46.342
Terry!

211
00:10:46.343 --> 00:10:48.282
You need to tell me
if this is getting brighter?


212
00:10:52.282 --> 00:10:53.283
<i>Go for Tom Berninger.</i>

213
00:10:53.284 --> 00:10:54.418
<i>Do you copy?</i>

214
00:10:54.419 --> 00:10:56.153
I copy. Go ahead.

215
00:10:56.154 --> 00:10:58.054
<i>Ready for your brother
down here.</i>


216
00:10:58.055 --> 00:10:59.558
Copy that.

217
00:11:00.558 --> 00:11:02.294
He's already angry at me.

218
00:11:03.294 --> 00:11:04.361
It's day one.

219
00:11:04.362 --> 00:11:05.862
Everyone's grumpy.

220
00:11:05.863 --> 00:11:07.964
<i>Tom. Do you copy?</i>

221
00:11:07.965 --> 00:11:09.632
Matt!

222
00:11:09.633 --> 00:11:12.612
He... I just
saw him go downstairs actually.


223
00:11:21.612 --> 00:11:22.679
Matt, this is awesome!

224
00:11:22.680 --> 00:11:25.015
Have you ever played
for this many people before?


225
00:11:25.016 --> 00:11:27.184
Nope. No, it's going to be...

226
00:11:27.185 --> 00:11:28.522
It's going to be weird.

227
00:11:31.522 --> 00:11:32.522
It's going to be fun.

228
00:11:35.193 --> 00:11:36.994
Why don't you just scream,
like, ahhh!


229
00:11:36.995 --> 00:11:38.429
Like...

230
00:11:38.430 --> 00:11:39.429
Yeah, maybe.

231
00:11:39.430 --> 00:11:41.398
Go in the bathroom
and shut the door.


232
00:11:41.399 --> 00:11:43.034
I'll go in here.

233
00:11:56.246 --> 00:11:57.246
I was thinking, you know,

234
00:11:57.247 --> 00:11:58.448
Lynyrd Skynyrd, when he died?

235
00:11:58.449 --> 00:11:59.449
Well, I don't know-- the guy,

236
00:11:59.450 --> 00:12:00.953
not "Leonard" himself.

237
00:12:01.953 --> 00:12:04.922
They had his brother
take over for the band.


238
00:12:04.923 --> 00:12:08.232
So...
This could be a...


239
00:12:14.232 --> 00:12:15.232
He is my...

240
00:12:16.101 --> 00:12:19.135
Seriously, man, talk about
riding his coattails.


241
00:12:19.136 --> 00:12:21.270
Literally, right now,

242
00:12:21.271 --> 00:12:23.539
I'm riding about
eight coattails.


243
00:12:23.540 --> 00:12:25.513
Two minutes, everyone!

244
00:14:38.642 --> 00:14:41.849
So yeah.
Are you rolling?


245
00:14:45.849 --> 00:14:47.361
Double decker bus.

246
00:14:56.361 --> 00:14:57.732
Hello?

247
00:15:00.732 --> 00:15:02.819
London.

248
00:15:21.819 --> 00:15:24.455
So, how famous
do you think you are?


249
00:15:25.455 --> 00:15:27.156
Aaa...

250
00:15:27.157 --> 00:15:29.525
Not very famous.

251
00:15:29.526 --> 00:15:32.194
Like, this famous.

252
00:15:32.195 --> 00:15:33.063
What was that?

253
00:15:33.064 --> 00:15:34.030
What were you holding
in your hands?


254
00:15:34.031 --> 00:15:39.369
No, I meant, like,
a small amount of fame.


255
00:15:39.370 --> 00:15:42.338
Are you asking
in terms of US Weekly fame?


256
00:15:42.339 --> 00:15:44.174
Like celebrity?

257
00:15:44.175 --> 00:15:46.208
Because we're not,
we're not, really famous...


258
00:15:46.209 --> 00:15:51.814
You are way more famous
than any of my friends.


259
00:15:51.815 --> 00:15:54.752
That's? Okay, I--

260
00:15:55.752 --> 00:15:56.886
Just stand right there.

261
00:15:56.887 --> 00:15:58.924
Okay.

262
00:15:59.924 --> 00:16:01.558
You know,
this is good too because I need


263
00:16:01.559 --> 00:16:03.727
more handsome shots
of you in the hood.


264
00:16:03.728 --> 00:16:05.395
Whose chairs are those?

265
00:16:05.396 --> 00:16:06.496
Umm? Not sure.

266
00:16:06.497 --> 00:16:08.668
I just want to move them
over there for now.


267
00:16:10.668 --> 00:16:13.372
Just like over here?

268
00:16:15.372 --> 00:16:17.310
Aaaannnd good.

269
00:16:20.310 --> 00:16:21.880
Don't sit on that.

270
00:16:22.880 --> 00:16:23.882
Just 'cause...

271
00:16:24.882 --> 00:16:27.616
<i>Where do you see The National
in 50 years?</i>


272
00:16:27.617 --> 00:16:30.353
Fifty years?

273
00:16:30.354 --> 00:16:32.823
I think, forty years.

274
00:16:32.824 --> 00:16:34.624
I think, I don't know...

275
00:16:34.625 --> 00:16:37.526
in 40 years,
I think we will be done.


276
00:16:37.527 --> 00:16:38.627
Really?

277
00:16:38.628 --> 00:16:40.764
In 40 years from right now?

278
00:16:40.765 --> 00:16:41.664
That would be, like,
being a band


279
00:16:41.665 --> 00:16:43.333
for 50 years, I think.

280
00:16:43.334 --> 00:16:46.602
I don't know if any band
has been a band for 50 years.


281
00:16:46.603 --> 00:16:47.804
The Rolling Stones.

282
00:16:47.805 --> 00:16:50.943
Well, okay, but, like seriously.

283
00:16:51.943 --> 00:16:56.313
I always kinda wondered,
do you have wallets?


284
00:16:56.314 --> 00:16:57.881
Do you carry wallets
on stage with you?


285
00:16:57.882 --> 00:17:00.984
Your ID when you're playing?

286
00:17:00.985 --> 00:17:02.319
Do you have your ID on you?

287
00:17:02.320 --> 00:17:03.620
Actually I do, yes.

288
00:17:03.621 --> 00:17:05.989
That's just weird to me.

289
00:17:18.302 --> 00:17:19.302
Warm up.

290
00:17:19.303 --> 00:17:20.303
I am.

291
00:17:20.304 --> 00:17:21.304
Why don't you button up?

292
00:17:21.305 --> 00:17:22.875
I'm trying to.

293
00:17:24.875 --> 00:17:27.744
Here, I'll take
your jackets, everybody.


294
00:17:27.745 --> 00:17:29.345
Tom said he'll take the jackets.

295
00:17:29.346 --> 00:17:30.717
On my arm.

296
00:17:32.717 --> 00:17:34.019
Thank you.

297
00:17:36.019 --> 00:17:39.355
I stock the buses every night.

298
00:17:39.356 --> 00:17:42.825
But there's always something
one band member doesn't have.


299
00:17:42.826 --> 00:17:45.562
Like a stick of
"Toberone" chocolate.


300
00:17:45.563 --> 00:17:46.963
You know?
It's like, what?


301
00:17:46.964 --> 00:17:49.533
You didn't ask
for Toberone last week.


302
00:17:49.534 --> 00:17:53.335
You know. And it's not even on the rider.
But I was supposed to pick--


303
00:17:53.336 --> 00:17:57.474
Even though that venue had
Toberone on the counter,


304
00:17:57.475 --> 00:17:59.315
I didn't know you really
wanted it in the bus.


305
00:17:59.943 --> 00:18:03.580
And I'm not going to take
every single piece of food


306
00:18:03.581 --> 00:18:04.381
that's in your dressing room

307
00:18:04.382 --> 00:18:06.615
and also put Reynold's Wrap
over it,


308
00:18:06.616 --> 00:18:08.354
and stick it on the bus.

309
00:18:11.354 --> 00:18:14.690
I like how he always says--
He acts all impatient,


310
00:18:14.691 --> 00:18:17.727
and acts like he doesn't like
going to these photo shoots,


311
00:18:17.728 --> 00:18:19.064
but I know he actually does.

312
00:18:20.064 --> 00:18:21.468
Look at him.

313
00:18:24.468 --> 00:18:25.728
I swear.

314
00:18:50.728 --> 00:18:52.610
I like a good tuck.

315
00:19:05.610 --> 00:19:07.410
It's nice in here, isn't it?

316
00:19:58.129 --> 00:19:59.129
Good show, Matt.

317
00:20:14.010 --> 00:20:14.843
It's been amazing.

318
00:20:14.844 --> 00:20:18.183
But it's just
that I'm feeling...


319
00:20:20.183 --> 00:20:21.584
It's just weird.

320
00:20:21.585 --> 00:20:24.187
It's not what I thought
it would be.


321
00:20:24.188 --> 00:20:25.958
And sometimes,
Matt walks off stage,


322
00:20:26.958 --> 00:20:28.658
and doesn't even recognize me.

323
00:20:28.659 --> 00:20:32.027
He's got this glazed over
look in his eyes.


324
00:20:32.028 --> 00:20:37.033
I think he has to go to
this weird zone sometimes,


325
00:20:37.034 --> 00:20:39.002
to deliver the show.

326
00:20:39.003 --> 00:20:42.805
You should never
take it personally.


327
00:20:42.806 --> 00:20:47.509
It's the job.

328
00:20:47.510 --> 00:20:49.116
Yeah, I know, it's a job.

329
00:20:53.116 --> 00:20:56.553
Ohhh! Nice one!

330
00:20:56.554 --> 00:20:57.554
That's how you do it.

331
00:21:06.130 --> 00:21:07.096
I don't know.

332
00:21:07.097 --> 00:21:09.899
I think we should all
be hanging out more.


333
00:21:09.900 --> 00:21:12.502
We might want to make this
a hard alcohol night.


334
00:21:12.503 --> 00:21:14.141
No, no, no!
That's verboten.


335
00:21:17.141 --> 00:21:19.141
We got some Jager in there.

336
00:21:19.142 --> 00:21:20.543
No, no.

337
00:21:20.544 --> 00:21:22.845
You've got the allergy.

338
00:21:22.846 --> 00:21:23.880
No, I don't.

339
00:21:23.881 --> 00:21:25.148
You've got the fucking allergy.

340
00:21:25.149 --> 00:21:26.216
Have I had the allergy--

341
00:21:26.217 --> 00:21:27.316
Yes!

342
00:21:27.317 --> 00:21:29.785
Have I been on this tour
and had the allergy?


343
00:21:29.786 --> 00:21:32.756
Have you fallen down
in a bodega,


344
00:21:32.757 --> 00:21:39.597
and knocked over the chips rack.

345
00:21:40.597 --> 00:21:42.765
Guilty. Guilty.

346
00:21:42.766 --> 00:21:45.768
That's why you have
to stay away from the whiskey.


347
00:21:45.769 --> 00:21:48.204
Tip your head over
the top of the thing.


348
00:21:48.205 --> 00:21:49.605
Yes.

349
00:21:49.606 --> 00:21:51.775
It doesn't leave a lot
to the imagination,


350
00:21:51.776 --> 00:21:52.842
but we can always blur it out.

351
00:21:52.843 --> 00:21:54.212
Don't worry about that.

352
00:21:56.212 --> 00:21:58.982
You and Scott seem to be
the two members of the band


353
00:21:58.983 --> 00:22:01.817
who actually live
a Rock & Roll lifestyle,


354
00:22:01.818 --> 00:22:03.652
from my observations.

355
00:22:03.653 --> 00:22:05.257
What's the question?

356
00:22:06.257 --> 00:22:10.159
How many like-- how--
What kind of...


357
00:22:10.160 --> 00:22:11.928
if you've done drugs?

358
00:22:11.929 --> 00:22:13.063
What kind of drugs
and how many drugs


359
00:22:13.064 --> 00:22:14.532
have you done?

360
00:22:17.168 --> 00:22:19.034
I don't mean to pry.

361
00:22:19.035 --> 00:22:21.571
Okay. Umm...

362
00:22:21.572 --> 00:22:25.880
They seem so coffee house
and yet you seem more metal.


363
00:22:29.801 --> 00:22:31.081
I just want to have fun on tour.

364
00:22:31.082 --> 00:22:34.249
I just want to...
you know.


365
00:22:34.250 --> 00:22:36.986
I mean, I'm with a rock band,
I kinda want to feel...


366
00:22:36.987 --> 00:22:39.988
It kind of disappoints me

367
00:22:39.989 --> 00:22:41.824
that there isn't
more crazy stuff going on.


368
00:22:41.825 --> 00:22:43.330
Yeah.

369
00:23:54.331 --> 00:23:57.936
You know how, yesterday,

370
00:23:58.936 --> 00:24:02.405
we asked for more beer
and a bottle of tequila?


371
00:24:02.406 --> 00:24:05.073
I just want you to know
we pay for all that.


372
00:24:05.074 --> 00:24:08.378
I know. I'm aware. I'm--

373
00:24:08.379 --> 00:24:09.746
Just keep it in mind

374
00:24:09.747 --> 00:24:11.214
that everything we use,
we pay for.


375
00:24:11.215 --> 00:24:13.816
Okay.

376
00:24:13.817 --> 00:24:14.784
Just keep that in mind.

377
00:24:14.785 --> 00:24:16.084
That's all I wanted to say.

378
00:24:16.085 --> 00:24:17.085
Party's over.

379
00:24:17.086 --> 00:24:19.824
Gotcha. Good, good call.

380
00:24:20.824 --> 00:24:23.726
Have you done the towels?

381
00:24:23.727 --> 00:24:25.027
Yes. I got all those
ready for ya.


382
00:24:25.028 --> 00:24:26.329
- Wine bucket?
- Yup.


383
00:24:26.330 --> 00:24:27.330
- Water bottles?
- Yup.


384
00:24:27.931 --> 00:24:30.269
- Everything's cool?
- Everything's cool.


385
00:24:33.269 --> 00:24:34.408
<i>Brandon for Tom.</i>

386
00:24:37.408 --> 00:24:38.978
I need towels and water bottles.

387
00:24:40.978 --> 00:24:42.099
<i>Tom, I thought you did this.</i>

388
00:24:42.947 --> 00:24:44.881
Brandon
just yelled at me earlier.


389
00:24:44.882 --> 00:24:46.882
I know he's got to be stressed.

390
00:24:46.883 --> 00:24:49.084
Why did he yell at you?

391
00:24:49.085 --> 00:24:50.085
For doing this.

392
00:24:50.086 --> 00:24:52.121
For just filming.

393
00:24:52.122 --> 00:24:54.858
I feel like the only reason
why he thinks I'm on tour,


394
00:24:54.859 --> 00:24:56.063
is because I'm your brother.

395
00:24:59.063 --> 00:25:00.296
Here's the truth,

396
00:25:00.297 --> 00:25:03.733
the only reason you are here
is because you're my brother.


397
00:25:03.734 --> 00:25:04.333
That's not tr--

398
00:25:04.334 --> 00:25:05.901
Well, that is true,

399
00:25:05.902 --> 00:25:07.136
but there are other reasons
why I'm here, too!


400
00:25:07.137 --> 00:25:08.103
Here's my point.

401
00:25:08.104 --> 00:25:10.073
You wouldn't be here
if you weren't my brother.


402
00:25:10.074 --> 00:25:15.378
But we need you here
and I'm glad you're here.


403
00:25:15.379 --> 00:25:16.313
You just have to make sure

404
00:25:16.314 --> 00:25:20.115
that all that other stuff
is taken care of.


405
00:25:20.116 --> 00:25:21.016
You're like the new guy,

406
00:25:21.017 --> 00:25:22.451
that doesn't really know
what he is doing,


407
00:25:22.452 --> 00:25:23.285
to be perfectly honest.

408
00:25:23.286 --> 00:25:25.021
I know what I'm... I'm just...

409
00:25:25.022 --> 00:25:27.390
Why are you taking
his side over mine?


410
00:25:27.391 --> 00:25:29.292
I'm not taking sides, Tom.

411
00:25:29.293 --> 00:25:31.303
Just turn the camera off.

412
00:25:39.303 --> 00:25:41.207
This whole thing is...

413
00:25:43.207 --> 00:25:46.409
It's weird that I'm even here.

414
00:25:46.410 --> 00:25:48.875
I don't even know
what I'm doing here.


415
00:27:58.875 --> 00:28:01.044
I think that's Moby's house?

416
00:28:01.045 --> 00:28:02.044
Where?

417
00:28:02.045 --> 00:28:04.080
Up on that hill.

418
00:28:04.081 --> 00:28:05.148
That castle-y looking thing,

419
00:28:05.149 --> 00:28:08.418
with the white turrets
and stuff.


420
00:28:08.419 --> 00:28:09.619
How do you know?

421
00:28:09.620 --> 00:28:17.427
There was a New York
Times online real estate tour.


422
00:28:17.428 --> 00:28:19.667
I swear that's it.
Looks super familiar.


423
00:28:23.667 --> 00:28:25.402
Hey, Moby!

424
00:28:26.402 --> 00:28:27.945
Don't
yell at the fucking neighbors!


425
00:28:51.094 --> 00:28:52.628
You drink all the time!

426
00:28:52.629 --> 00:28:54.530
But when you get started,
you don't stop.


427
00:28:54.531 --> 00:28:56.232
I'm just saying be careful.

428
00:28:56.233 --> 00:28:58.467
You get on the slope,
and you slide down the slope,


429
00:28:58.468 --> 00:29:00.436
and you don't turn around.

430
00:29:00.437 --> 00:29:03.371
That's why I was telling you
before we left on tour...


431
00:29:03.372 --> 00:29:06.441
Whatever.
You seem fine, but slow down.


432
00:29:06.442 --> 00:29:07.342
You've got the allergy.

433
00:29:07.343 --> 00:29:08.343
Okay.

434
00:29:36.340 --> 00:29:37.540
Not from me.

435
00:29:37.541 --> 00:29:39.740
All of our guests are out there?

436
00:30:10.740 --> 00:30:13.676
Okay. We are still
figuring out our bass guitar.


437
00:30:13.677 --> 00:30:16.420
Don't worry.
We'll get it together.


438
00:30:24.420 --> 00:30:25.490
What's wrong?

439
00:30:27.490 --> 00:30:28.490
Nothing.

440
00:30:32.328 --> 00:30:35.363
Did somebody say something
to you?


441
00:30:35.364 --> 00:30:37.533
Nothing. It's fine.

442
00:30:37.534 --> 00:30:41.469
Can I have,
literally, two minutes?


443
00:30:41.470 --> 00:30:43.672
The show sucked...

444
00:30:43.673 --> 00:30:44.673
It was fine.

445
00:30:44.674 --> 00:30:46.441
I thought it was okay.

446
00:30:46.442 --> 00:30:47.689
No, it sucked.

447
00:30:58.689 --> 00:31:00.824
Do you want to go get
something to eat?


448
00:31:01.824 --> 00:31:03.512
Matt!

449
00:31:22.512 --> 00:31:23.713
I need to see the footage

450
00:31:23.714 --> 00:31:24.746
of this film you're working on.

451
00:31:24.747 --> 00:31:26.114
Okay. Yeah.

452
00:31:26.115 --> 00:31:27.149
I'll get it to you.
I'll get it to you.


453
00:31:27.150 --> 00:31:29.217
Okay.

454
00:31:29.218 --> 00:31:34.756
Is it for any clearances
or anything? Or is it just...


455
00:31:34.757 --> 00:31:36.492
I think we're all
a little concerned.


456
00:31:36.493 --> 00:31:37.293
I mean, I'd like to make sure

457
00:31:37.294 --> 00:31:38.494
we don't have
any clearance issues.


458
00:31:38.495 --> 00:31:39.794
But we're also
a little concerned


459
00:31:39.795 --> 00:31:43.431
how the band is going
to come off looking in this.


460
00:31:43.432 --> 00:31:45.133
Who's been asking about me?

461
00:31:45.134 --> 00:31:46.602
Nobody. Nobody yet.

462
00:31:46.603 --> 00:31:48.304
Okay.

463
00:31:48.305 --> 00:31:50.139
Okay.

464
00:31:50.140 --> 00:31:51.140
You know, I'm just concerned.

465
00:31:51.141 --> 00:31:52.140
No worries. No worries.

466
00:31:52.141 --> 00:31:53.575
You'll see a cut ASAP.

467
00:31:53.576 --> 00:31:55.878
- Okay.
- Alright.


468
00:31:55.879 --> 00:31:57.780
I've been hearing
that there's been some doubt,


469
00:31:57.781 --> 00:32:01.417
or concern about my abilities.

470
00:32:01.418 --> 00:32:02.584
I want to show you
my chops here.


471
00:32:02.585 --> 00:32:05.220
This is just something simple
I did a little while ago.


472
00:32:05.221 --> 00:32:07.290
I don't want to tell you
too much about it now.


473
00:32:07.291 --> 00:32:09.240
We'll talk about it afterwards.

474
00:33:06.315 --> 00:33:08.383
<i>And now, I have the pleasure
of introducing</i>


475
00:33:08.384 --> 00:33:11.720
<i>one of our great
musical guests tonight.</i>


476
00:33:11.721 --> 00:33:15.304
<i>Give it up for The National!</i>

477
00:33:53.462 --> 00:33:55.398
Guys, we have to move
everyone out.


478
00:33:55.399 --> 00:33:56.399
Anyone who is not
getting a click


479
00:33:56.400 --> 00:33:58.574
has to move down the hall.

480
00:34:04.574 --> 00:34:05.574
See you later, guys.

481
00:34:14.951 --> 00:34:16.885
Was that him?

482
00:34:16.886 --> 00:34:18.454
I can't stand here?

483
00:34:18.455 --> 00:34:20.689
Can I stand right here?

484
00:34:20.690 --> 00:34:22.791
They don't want anybody
in front of these doors.


485
00:34:22.792 --> 00:34:24.795
Damn it.

486
00:34:25.795 --> 00:34:27.729
I'm sorry you didn't get
to meet the president.


487
00:34:27.730 --> 00:34:28.863
They only vetted the five of us

488
00:34:28.864 --> 00:34:31.032
for whatever reason.

489
00:34:31.033 --> 00:34:34.970
It's not like
we could complain about that.


490
00:34:34.971 --> 00:34:37.276
If-- whatever.

491
00:34:39.276 --> 00:34:41.510
If there's an opportunity
again in the future,


492
00:34:41.511 --> 00:34:43.845
I will try to get you
to meet the President.


493
00:34:43.846 --> 00:34:46.448
Did they even do
a background check?


494
00:34:46.449 --> 00:34:47.650
They probably did
a background check


495
00:34:47.651 --> 00:34:52.921
and found I had a DUI
from ten years ago.


496
00:34:52.922 --> 00:34:54.823
No, they didn't do that.

497
00:34:54.824 --> 00:34:55.825
They didn't even
check you at all.


498
00:34:55.826 --> 00:34:59.561
And I'm sure it had
nothing to do with your DUI.


499
00:34:59.562 --> 00:35:00.963
I feel like
I'm on the outside of his world,


500
00:35:00.964 --> 00:35:03.298
looking in, you know?

501
00:35:03.299 --> 00:35:05.733
And even though there was
a huge age difference


502
00:35:05.734 --> 00:35:09.572
growing up,
it was never like that.


503
00:35:09.573 --> 00:35:13.809
I know he likes me
as his little brother.


504
00:35:13.810 --> 00:35:16.345
And he would do
fun things with me.


505
00:35:16.346 --> 00:35:22.084
He would take me to movies
and force me to go fishing.


506
00:35:22.085 --> 00:35:23.690
Anyway's...It's...

507
00:35:26.690 --> 00:35:30.027
Sometimes I think,
he never really understood me.


508
00:35:32.027 --> 00:35:34.329
You were the weird, artsy kid.

509
00:35:34.330 --> 00:35:35.697
Yeah. I was more-
- I was like...

510
00:35:35.698 --> 00:35:37.499
And he was like
the golden boy, the quarterback.


511
00:35:37.500 --> 00:35:38.733
Yes. Exactly.

512
00:35:38.734 --> 00:35:41.604
I felt like,
I think differently.


513
00:35:41.605 --> 00:35:42.805
Matt has it easy.

514
00:35:42.806 --> 00:35:44.039
He's got thousands of people
reminding him


515
00:35:44.040 --> 00:35:45.440
of how brilliant
he is every night.


516
00:35:45.942 --> 00:35:49.915
Of course, you might feel
a little jealous of that.


517
00:35:51.915 --> 00:35:53.816
Maybe your relationship
is suffering.


518
00:35:53.817 --> 00:35:55.953
But I think Matt's got
a lot in his life.


519
00:35:56.953 --> 00:36:02.490
He's gone from working a job
to being a rock star.


520
00:36:02.491 --> 00:36:04.793
There's a shift there.

521
00:36:04.794 --> 00:36:06.061
It's hard to know,

522
00:36:06.062 --> 00:36:08.030
I always say
that what he has to do,


523
00:36:08.031 --> 00:36:10.131
is a lot harder
than what we have to do.


524
00:36:10.132 --> 00:36:12.968
- Are you okay?
- Are you comfortable with these--


525
00:36:12.969 --> 00:36:14.436
Yeah, it's cool.

526
00:36:14.437 --> 00:36:18.706
I mean, I'm a little,
sort of, perplexed


527
00:36:18.707 --> 00:36:21.577
because you guys said
you wanted to get me


528
00:36:21.578 --> 00:36:23.778
into the movie
and talk about me.


529
00:36:23.779 --> 00:36:24.579
But it seems like you're just...

530
00:36:24.580 --> 00:36:25.613
Yes!

531
00:36:25.614 --> 00:36:28.483
...want to talk about Matt.

532
00:36:28.484 --> 00:36:29.684
It's normal.

533
00:36:29.685 --> 00:36:31.019
Most people, a lot of people,

534
00:36:31.020 --> 00:36:33.055
just ask questions about Matt.

535
00:36:33.056 --> 00:36:39.774
No, that's okay.
No, you're-- I'm-- Alright.


536
00:36:51.774 --> 00:36:55.443
You kinda got to get
your shit together a little bit.


537
00:36:55.444 --> 00:36:56.912
I'm happy
you're on tour with us.


538
00:36:56.913 --> 00:36:57.913
I have no problem...

539
00:37:01.265 --> 00:37:02.985
I'm happy you are trying
to make this movie.


540
00:37:02.986 --> 00:37:05.854
But, you got to remember
you're not--


541
00:37:05.855 --> 00:37:07.095
I'm just getting exposure here.

542
00:37:10.547 --> 00:37:12.427
I have no problem sharing
a hotel room with you,


543
00:37:12.428 --> 00:37:15.863
but for example,

544
00:37:15.864 --> 00:37:19.635
when I get up
in the middle of the night


545
00:37:19.636 --> 00:37:24.072
and go to the bathroom,
and there's cereal and milk


546
00:37:24.073 --> 00:37:27.508
on the floor
of the fucking bathroom,


547
00:37:27.509 --> 00:37:29.144
of the hotel room.

548
00:37:29.145 --> 00:37:30.646
Wait, are we going to do a--

549
00:37:30.647 --> 00:37:31.847
It's irritating.

550
00:37:31.848 --> 00:37:33.615
You couldn't wipe it up
with a towel?


551
00:37:33.616 --> 00:37:35.150
I did wipe it up with a towel!

552
00:37:35.151 --> 00:37:38.621
Why did I go in there
at one in the morning,


553
00:37:38.622 --> 00:37:41.689
and I'm stepping
and almost fall in milk?


554
00:37:41.690 --> 00:37:43.124
Were you eating in the dark?

555
00:37:43.125 --> 00:37:45.660
Your wet bathing suit
was hanging off the table


556
00:37:45.661 --> 00:37:46.829
in the lounge of the bus.

557
00:37:46.830 --> 00:37:48.963
Like, 12 people
live on this bus.


558
00:37:48.964 --> 00:37:50.633
You can't hang
your wet bathing suit.


559
00:37:50.634 --> 00:37:52.700
Where were you swimming?

560
00:37:52.701 --> 00:37:53.869
Where are you going?

561
00:37:53.870 --> 00:37:54.903
I'm just standing up.

562
00:37:54.904 --> 00:37:58.039
I'm just..
I'm a little..


563
00:37:58.040 --> 00:38:02.244
I feel like I'm free falling
a little bit here.


564
00:38:02.245 --> 00:38:05.113
Well then, pull out of it!

565
00:38:05.114 --> 00:38:06.014
You have to come up

566
00:38:06.015 --> 00:38:08.786
with some kind of idea
for this movie.


567
00:38:09.745 --> 00:38:10.985
Okay, here's what I'm thinking.

568
00:38:10.986 --> 00:38:15.124
I just need a shot of you.
Can you look up?


569
00:38:15.125 --> 00:38:17.226
Look away.

570
00:38:17.227 --> 00:38:19.196
Look intense into the camera!

571
00:38:21.196 --> 00:38:23.564
Look away.

572
00:38:23.565 --> 00:38:26.535
Okay now act like you just
got a really good idea!


573
00:38:26.536 --> 00:38:27.903
Have a thought like...

574
00:38:27.904 --> 00:38:31.072
Wait a second!
Do that.


575
00:38:31.073 --> 00:38:33.842
And say, wait a second.

576
00:38:33.843 --> 00:38:35.177
Wait a second!

577
00:38:35.178 --> 00:38:36.211
He's not perfect, you know.

578
00:38:36.212 --> 00:38:40.182
Yeah, no, he's not perfect.

579
00:38:40.183 --> 00:38:41.182
I don't know.

580
00:38:41.183 --> 00:38:44.586
He frustrates me at times,

581
00:38:44.587 --> 00:38:47.856
and then other times,
he surprises you.


582
00:38:47.857 --> 00:38:50.025
And it's like anybody.
Nobody's perfect.


583
00:38:50.026 --> 00:38:50.858
Has he ever blown up?

584
00:38:50.859 --> 00:38:53.861
Has he ever lost
his temper with you?


585
00:38:53.862 --> 00:38:55.664
Yes.

586
00:38:55.665 --> 00:38:59.867
I'm going to grab myself
some wine.


587
00:38:59.868 --> 00:39:01.102
Explain into the camera
how much--


588
00:39:01.103 --> 00:39:02.637
I'll have some wine.

589
00:39:02.638 --> 00:39:04.773
Explain in the camera
how much...


590
00:39:04.774 --> 00:39:06.678
And I'm listening.

591
00:39:08.678 --> 00:39:13.682
<i>Well, when we were trying
to finish Boxer.</i>


592
00:39:13.683 --> 00:39:15.718
<i>It was the song,
Apartment Story.</i>


593
00:39:15.719 --> 00:39:19.188
This is what caused it.

594
00:39:19.189 --> 00:39:22.960
The original vocal was
the first scratch vocal


595
00:39:23.960 --> 00:39:29.865
that had this real
effortless, almost sleepy...


596
00:39:29.866 --> 00:39:31.633
Thanks.

597
00:39:31.634 --> 00:39:33.735
...vibe to it.

598
00:39:33.736 --> 00:39:37.840
And he re-did the vocal
one day,


599
00:39:37.841 --> 00:39:40.742
and I really in my heart
it was like, "It's wrong."


600
00:39:40.743 --> 00:39:42.845
And I couldn't shut up about it.

601
00:39:42.846 --> 00:39:44.880
I didn't realize
how angry he was getting,


602
00:39:44.881 --> 00:39:47.215
and at some point,
a switch flipped,


603
00:39:47.216 --> 00:39:49.617
and I saw blood in his eyes.

604
00:39:49.618 --> 00:39:51.153
And he just tore my head off

605
00:39:51.154 --> 00:39:53.354
and it's actually frightening
when he gets angry.


606
00:39:53.355 --> 00:39:55.090
It's terribly frightening.

607
00:39:55.091 --> 00:39:57.161
Because he steam rolls you.

608
00:39:59.161 --> 00:40:00.931
Go ahead.
I'm sorry, go ahead.


609
00:40:02.886 --> 00:40:04.166
I don't want to pile it on Matt.

610
00:40:04.167 --> 00:40:06.702
But anyway's, so I left.

611
00:40:06.703 --> 00:40:08.035
No, pile it on.

612
00:40:08.036 --> 00:40:11.206
It's too loaded,
you guys as brothers.


613
00:40:11.207 --> 00:40:16.677
You're too set in your
ancient patterns of behavior


614
00:40:16.678 --> 00:40:18.380
as brothers.

615
00:40:18.381 --> 00:40:19.782
You're the underdog.

616
00:40:19.783 --> 00:40:22.684
He's the dominating alpha male.

617
00:40:22.685 --> 00:40:24.357
You're not going to win.

618
00:40:28.357 --> 00:40:33.695
Do you want me to just
bring them drinks and then--


619
00:40:33.696 --> 00:40:34.436
No, no, no.

620
00:40:34.437 --> 00:40:36.197
They're not going to
want to walk into a room


621
00:40:36.198 --> 00:40:37.198
with a camera on.

622
00:40:37.199 --> 00:40:38.400
So I don't think
you should film.


623
00:40:38.401 --> 00:40:39.401
Put the camera down.

624
00:40:39.402 --> 00:40:40.401
That's bullshit!

625
00:40:40.402 --> 00:40:41.403
Just for tonight.

626
00:40:41.404 --> 00:40:42.371
I'm fucking filming them!

627
00:40:42.372 --> 00:40:45.206
I've been on tour for,
like, eight months.


628
00:40:45.207 --> 00:40:46.374
Nothing's fucking happened

629
00:40:46.375 --> 00:40:49.311
until some television stars
on TV show that I watch...


630
00:40:49.312 --> 00:40:51.313
It's going to be fucking awesome

631
00:40:51.314 --> 00:40:52.414
to put them in the movie!

632
00:40:52.415 --> 00:40:54.816
When people who are
getting spotted all the time,


633
00:40:54.817 --> 00:40:56.318
celebrities, walk into a room,

634
00:40:56.319 --> 00:40:58.220
And, without them knowing,

635
00:40:58.221 --> 00:41:02.925
there is a live camera on them,
it's just--


636
00:41:02.926 --> 00:41:04.059
I'm fucking filming them, Matt.

637
00:41:04.060 --> 00:41:06.360
- I'm filming them.
- They just want to relax.


638
00:41:06.361 --> 00:41:08.896
I just want to relax.

639
00:41:08.897 --> 00:41:11.727
Please, does that make sense?

640
00:41:37.727 --> 00:41:40.362
Tom! How's it going?
We met outside.


641
00:42:21.103 --> 00:42:23.738
We're almost
two hours out of town


642
00:42:23.739 --> 00:42:26.140
and Brandon, wakes me up
and says,


643
00:42:26.141 --> 00:42:27.441
"Dude!
Your brother's not here!"


644
00:42:27.442 --> 00:42:28.943
You were an hour
out of town actually.


645
00:42:28.944 --> 00:42:31.280
Don't film this!
Put the camera down!


646
00:42:31.281 --> 00:42:35.284
Somebody looks in your bunk
and Tom's not in there!


647
00:42:35.285 --> 00:42:37.955
We looked.
Nobody has any idea.


648
00:42:38.955 --> 00:42:41.490
Brandon was furious.
I was super worried!


649
00:42:41.491 --> 00:42:42.791
Where were you?

650
00:42:42.792 --> 00:42:43.592
Who were you with?

651
00:42:43.593 --> 00:42:45.226
I was with Bryan and Scott!

652
00:42:45.227 --> 00:42:46.294
They were on the bus!

653
00:42:46.295 --> 00:42:48.030
They made it back for bus call

654
00:42:48.031 --> 00:42:49.831
like you're supposed to.

655
00:42:49.832 --> 00:42:50.631
Put the camera down!

656
00:42:50.632 --> 00:42:51.666
Who leaves friends at a bar?

657
00:42:51.667 --> 00:42:53.334
They should have been,
"Hey Tom, we're leaving."


658
00:42:53.335 --> 00:42:54.202
No one did that.

659
00:42:54.203 --> 00:42:55.871
You're not their responsibility!

660
00:42:55.872 --> 00:42:57.005
You're a fucking adult!

661
00:42:57.006 --> 00:42:58.888
I was just having a good time!

662
00:43:11.888 --> 00:43:13.055
What did he say?

663
00:43:13.056 --> 00:43:14.958
I'm sorry. We have to go.

664
00:43:15.958 --> 00:43:17.129
Am I fired or what?

665
00:43:20.129 --> 00:43:22.863
Technically yes.

666
00:43:22.864 --> 00:43:25.032
Don't put it
through that filter.


667
00:43:25.033 --> 00:43:26.334
Please. Just think of
this as an opportunity.


668
00:43:26.335 --> 00:43:27.836
Now you can...

669
00:43:27.837 --> 00:43:29.839
Why are you filming this?

670
00:43:30.839 --> 00:43:32.974
Are you sure
you want to film this?


671
00:43:32.975 --> 00:43:33.843
If you don't mind,

672
00:43:33.844 --> 00:43:36.845
I would like
to have this on record.


673
00:43:36.846 --> 00:43:41.416
We hoped that this would be
the right fit.


674
00:43:41.417 --> 00:43:46.253
And it isn't working.

675
00:43:46.254 --> 00:43:50.837
This is when it gets
a little more depressing.


676
00:46:40.997 --> 00:46:42.063
What's this one called?

677
00:46:42.064 --> 00:46:44.231
- This one?
- Yeah.


678
00:46:44.232 --> 00:46:45.666
It's just going through
the garden or something.


679
00:46:45.667 --> 00:46:47.468
Looks like a palm tree in there.

680
00:46:47.469 --> 00:46:49.604
No.

681
00:46:49.605 --> 00:46:51.439
- That's my favorite one.
- Which one?


682
00:46:51.440 --> 00:46:53.073
This one.
This one?


683
00:46:53.074 --> 00:46:55.142
Yeah. I like this one.

684
00:46:55.143 --> 00:46:59.146
These are some of my pastels.

685
00:46:59.147 --> 00:47:00.581
Well, I got some questions.

686
00:47:00.582 --> 00:47:01.582
Let me sit down.

687
00:47:04.220 --> 00:47:05.220
Off the top of your head,

688
00:47:05.221 --> 00:47:06.901
how do you think
Matt and I are different?


689
00:47:10.459 --> 00:47:12.029
Growing up. Growing up.

690
00:47:14.029 --> 00:47:16.631
How were Matt and I
different from each other?


691
00:47:16.632 --> 00:47:20.735
Matt was
a lot easier to raise than you.


692
00:47:20.736 --> 00:47:21.802
What was that laugh all about?

693
00:47:21.803 --> 00:47:24.104
Well, I mean,

694
00:47:24.105 --> 00:47:27.608
you were a hard kid to...
you know that!


695
00:47:27.609 --> 00:47:29.376
For instance,
you wouldn't do things.


696
00:47:29.377 --> 00:47:32.079
You wouldn't get in
the pool down at swim lessons.


697
00:47:32.080 --> 00:47:34.816
You cried all the time
in first grade.


698
00:47:34.817 --> 00:47:37.052
If you were going to
football practice,


699
00:47:37.053 --> 00:47:39.554
I had to wait in the car,
I couldn't leave.


700
00:47:39.555 --> 00:47:40.454
I just didn't like
football practice.


701
00:47:40.455 --> 00:47:42.389
I didn't like getting told
what to do.


702
00:47:42.390 --> 00:47:44.758
When I didn't even
want to do that.


703
00:47:44.759 --> 00:47:47.662
But you needed to do
something, complete something.


704
00:47:47.663 --> 00:47:49.497
You always wanted
to quit things.


705
00:47:49.498 --> 00:47:51.233
No, I didn't.

706
00:47:51.234 --> 00:47:52.770
Like what?

707
00:47:54.770 --> 00:47:56.470
What do you mean?

708
00:47:56.471 --> 00:47:59.840
I think you didn't--
Well, did you start baseball?


709
00:47:59.841 --> 00:48:01.242
Did you ever play baseball?

710
00:48:01.243 --> 00:48:02.577
Yeah, but I quit that.

711
00:48:02.578 --> 00:48:04.278
Yeah, that's what I said.
You quit that.


712
00:48:04.279 --> 00:48:06.180
We use to let you quit things
every now and again


713
00:48:06.181 --> 00:48:07.416
if you didn't like it.

714
00:48:07.417 --> 00:48:10.751
But then it got to the point
you were quitting everything.


715
00:48:10.752 --> 00:48:14.322
Well, I thought that's not
a good habit to get into.


716
00:48:14.323 --> 00:48:16.557
Who was a better artist?

717
00:48:16.558 --> 00:48:18.726
Well, we can look at that.

718
00:48:18.727 --> 00:48:20.561
You were both very different.

719
00:48:20.562 --> 00:48:25.867
Look, look!
These are my inspirations.


720
00:48:25.868 --> 00:48:30.537
This was Matt's art which was
very abstract and minimal.


721
00:48:30.538 --> 00:48:31.538
And this is all you work!

722
00:48:33.475 --> 00:48:35.644
Take some shot of that.
I think that's really cool.


723
00:48:35.645 --> 00:48:36.644
Yeah, this is pretty good.

724
00:48:36.645 --> 00:48:37.646
Yeah, this is great.

725
00:48:37.647 --> 00:48:39.381
This is the type of work
you did.


726
00:48:39.382 --> 00:48:40.881
Really wonderful.

727
00:48:40.882 --> 00:48:43.151
What's this guy doing?
Is he sawing a leg?


728
00:48:43.152 --> 00:48:44.718
He's making a leg.

729
00:48:44.719 --> 00:48:47.322
Near an empty creek.

730
00:48:47.323 --> 00:48:51.629
And then he's dreaming
about new legs.


731
00:48:53.629 --> 00:48:56.798
And then same guy
in a school bus,


732
00:48:56.799 --> 00:48:58.602
and he's thinking
about eating a leg.


733
00:49:00.602 --> 00:49:02.281
What's not to love about that?

734
00:49:12.281 --> 00:49:13.280
What other differences

735
00:49:13.281 --> 00:49:15.249
do you see between me and Matt?

736
00:49:15.250 --> 00:49:17.218
I think, Matt really,

737
00:49:17.219 --> 00:49:19.320
just has a great deal
of self confidence.


738
00:49:19.321 --> 00:49:21.756
And I don't think that you have

739
00:49:21.757 --> 00:49:24.825
that kind of confidence
that he has.


740
00:49:24.826 --> 00:49:27.628
Because you obviously
haven't had


741
00:49:27.629 --> 00:49:28.896
the same kind of success.

742
00:49:28.897 --> 00:49:32.935
He's well known
in the Indie rock circles


743
00:49:33.935 --> 00:49:37.204
and the band is doing very well.

744
00:49:37.205 --> 00:49:38.413
In your personality--

745
00:49:44.413 --> 00:49:46.949
Matt could get angry
a little bit easier,


746
00:49:47.949 --> 00:49:50.418
and sometimes,
he seemed to be more moody


747
00:49:50.419 --> 00:49:52.354
when we was younger.

748
00:49:52.355 --> 00:49:56.191
Mom used to worry
about him being moody.


749
00:49:56.192 --> 00:50:00.260
You never seemed to worry
a whole lot about things.


750
00:50:00.261 --> 00:50:02.634
You just took it as it came.

751
00:50:05.634 --> 00:50:06.633
Whatever you were doing,

752
00:50:06.634 --> 00:50:08.302
if that's what you wanted to do,

753
00:50:08.303 --> 00:50:09.204
that was fine.

754
00:50:09.205 --> 00:50:11.405
- I was always happy.
- Oh God, I know.


755
00:50:11.406 --> 00:50:12.340
You were happy.

756
00:50:12.341 --> 00:50:16.244
Until now, I'm the depressed one

757
00:50:16.245 --> 00:50:17.912
and Matt's all happy again.

758
00:50:17.913 --> 00:50:21.349
Because he's successful.
Right?


759
00:50:21.350 --> 00:50:22.916
You're successful.

760
00:50:22.917 --> 00:50:24.985
No, I'm not.
You will be.


761
00:50:24.986 --> 00:50:26.787
I'm telling you I know that.

762
00:50:26.788 --> 00:50:28.722
I'm positive of it.

763
00:50:28.723 --> 00:50:30.227
What have I always told you?

764
00:50:32.227 --> 00:50:33.528
I'm your most creative.

765
00:50:33.529 --> 00:50:35.829
Most talented.

766
00:50:35.830 --> 00:50:36.870
You were my most talented.

767
00:50:36.931 --> 00:50:37.798
And I've said that

768
00:50:37.799 --> 00:50:40.535
from the time
you were a little kid.


769
00:50:40.536 --> 00:50:43.304
And I believe it.
I still believe it.


770
00:50:43.305 --> 00:50:45.402
I mean it!
You don't believe it.


771
00:51:13.402 --> 00:51:14.601
Move that up.

772
00:51:14.602 --> 00:51:16.908
All the way up,
right back to the wall.


773
00:51:19.908 --> 00:51:22.876
You don't think she'll
mind me living in here, do you?


774
00:51:22.877 --> 00:51:25.350
Well, this is her play room.

775
00:51:28.350 --> 00:51:30.418
What kind of job
do you think I'll get?


776
00:51:30.419 --> 00:51:32.921
You think I'll be a movie maker?

777
00:51:32.922 --> 00:51:35.055
No!

778
00:51:35.056 --> 00:51:40.461
Do you think I will be dating

779
00:51:40.462 --> 00:51:41.462
a hot movie star someday?

780
00:51:41.931 --> 00:51:43.564
No!

781
00:51:43.565 --> 00:51:45.368
No way.

782
00:51:47.368 --> 00:51:48.369
My phone.

783
00:51:48.370 --> 00:51:49.903
My phone!

784
00:51:49.904 --> 00:51:51.574
My phone!

785
00:51:52.574 --> 00:51:54.876
Let it go!

786
00:51:54.877 --> 00:51:55.982
Fine.

787
00:51:59.982 --> 00:52:01.983
Can I use a pizza slicer
on your head?


788
00:52:01.984 --> 00:52:04.017
Tom, you can stay with us
as long as you want.


789
00:52:04.018 --> 00:52:05.519
I think it will be fun.

790
00:52:05.520 --> 00:52:06.524
Okay. Thanks. Good.

791
00:52:08.524 --> 00:52:09.590
You can close the door,

792
00:52:09.591 --> 00:52:10.892
and you can do nothing

793
00:52:10.893 --> 00:52:14.729
but focus on
finishing the movie.


794
00:52:14.730 --> 00:52:15.963
After that,
then we can figure out


795
00:52:15.964 --> 00:52:16.964
what you are going to do.

796
00:52:28.511 --> 00:52:30.644
This is the movie

797
00:52:30.645 --> 00:52:32.012
in no particular order.

798
00:52:32.013 --> 00:52:35.383
But it's scene and ideas
that I'm dealing with,


799
00:52:35.384 --> 00:52:36.721
I'm working on.

800
00:52:38.721 --> 00:52:40.988
Let me tell you,
the color coding


801
00:52:40.989 --> 00:52:43.825
has a lot to do
with how it's set up.


802
00:52:43.826 --> 00:52:48.829
We have the pink stuff--
is tour.


803
00:52:48.830 --> 00:52:51.733
On the road.
The road going by.


804
00:52:51.734 --> 00:52:53.867
You know, the asphalt going by.

805
00:52:53.868 --> 00:52:57.037
The blue ones
are sentimental, you know.


806
00:52:57.038 --> 00:53:03.077
Something that will touch
their hearts in some way.


807
00:53:03.078 --> 00:53:06.814
The purple ones are scenes
with just band guys in them.


808
00:53:06.815 --> 00:53:09.684
This is basically
all new stuff I just found,


809
00:53:09.685 --> 00:53:11.686
just recently.

810
00:53:11.687 --> 00:53:12.720
I see yellow dots,

811
00:53:12.721 --> 00:53:14.622
I see pink dots,
I see green dots.


812
00:53:14.623 --> 00:53:15.889
They're all the same.

813
00:53:15.890 --> 00:53:18.159
Well, except for the green dots.

814
00:53:18.160 --> 00:53:20.894
Wait. Tom, these aren't
in any sort of order?


815
00:53:20.895 --> 00:53:22.162
No. Well, somewhat.

816
00:53:22.163 --> 00:53:25.935
They're not in.
No. Not yet.


817
00:53:26.935 --> 00:53:28.802
But it's for me
when I'm at my computer,


818
00:53:28.803 --> 00:53:31.673
and I figure out
what comes next.


819
00:53:31.674 --> 00:53:32.773
What's something
that comes next.


820
00:53:32.774 --> 00:53:37.445
Then I have a reference.
It's more like a reference.


821
00:53:37.446 --> 00:53:38.479
No, that's cool.

822
00:53:38.480 --> 00:53:40.615
All I'm saying is
that it's impossible for me


823
00:53:40.616 --> 00:53:43.851
to give you any feedback
on the movie at all,


824
00:53:43.852 --> 00:53:45.619
by just looking
at these post-it notes.


825
00:53:45.620 --> 00:53:46.921
It looks interesting.

826
00:53:46.922 --> 00:53:48.456
It looks like you have
an interesting movie.


827
00:53:48.457 --> 00:53:50.124
You have skinny dipping Iggy.

828
00:53:50.125 --> 00:53:51.092
Is that Iggy Pop?

829
00:53:51.093 --> 00:53:52.492
Yes.

830
00:53:52.493 --> 00:53:53.860
You got him skinny dipping?

831
00:53:53.861 --> 00:53:55.729
No. I didn't get him
skinny dipping.


832
00:53:55.730 --> 00:53:56.898
He was playing in the background

833
00:53:56.899 --> 00:54:00.535
and there were skinny dippers
at that festival in Germany.


834
00:54:00.536 --> 00:54:01.903
But don't fall in love with it,

835
00:54:01.904 --> 00:54:05.974
because I did not get
the skinny dippers releases.


836
00:54:05.975 --> 00:54:08.075
Tom, this does look exciting.

837
00:54:08.076 --> 00:54:10.445
No, no. Tom, I'm not
trying to be discouraging.


838
00:54:10.446 --> 00:54:12.847
I'm totally encouraging.

839
00:54:12.848 --> 00:54:16.217
So all you wanted is for me
to understand your system?


840
00:54:16.218 --> 00:54:17.218
- Yes.
- Okay. Cool.


841
00:54:19.154 --> 00:54:20.088
Tom, what's this?

842
00:54:20.089 --> 00:54:22.590
That's actually a self portrait

843
00:54:22.591 --> 00:54:24.892
that I messed up on.

844
00:54:24.893 --> 00:54:26.069
And I just put horns on it.

845
00:54:35.069 --> 00:54:37.239
Can we go through it real quick?

846
00:55:17.879 --> 00:55:21.548
When you embark on a
new album like this right here,


847
00:55:21.549 --> 00:55:22.816
how do you deal with that?

848
00:55:22.817 --> 00:55:25.820
Just tell me
about your struggles


849
00:55:25.821 --> 00:55:28.555
with the creative process
a little bit.


850
00:55:28.556 --> 00:55:29.990
I mean, the most stressful
thing for me


851
00:55:29.991 --> 00:55:32.526
is before you have an idea.

852
00:55:32.527 --> 00:55:34.996
<i>Like, I need to write
National songs,</i>


853
00:55:34.997 --> 00:55:36.597
and I can't think of anything.

854
00:55:36.598 --> 00:55:37.698
And that's really stressful.

855
00:55:37.699 --> 00:55:38.979
But the minute you have an idea,

856
00:55:39.935 --> 00:55:42.040
the making of the thing
is really fun.


857
00:55:46.040 --> 00:55:48.642
I would say that 90 percent
of everything you do


858
00:55:48.643 --> 00:55:51.912
is either bad,
rejected, or overlooked,


859
00:55:51.913 --> 00:55:53.581
and that's just to be expected.

860
00:55:53.582 --> 00:55:54.782
Look at us.
We're making records


861
00:55:54.783 --> 00:55:58.186
and it's like 40 to 45 minutes
of sound.


862
00:55:58.187 --> 00:56:00.253
And that takes us,
like, two years!


863
00:56:00.254 --> 00:56:02.889
With five people
and people helping us.


864
00:56:02.890 --> 00:56:04.559
People working and producing,

865
00:56:04.560 --> 00:56:06.727
everyone in the studio
and all that stuff.


866
00:56:06.728 --> 00:56:09.764
And then finally,
at the end of all that,


867
00:56:09.765 --> 00:56:13.609
there's 45 minutes
of sound coming out of speakers.


868
00:56:21.609 --> 00:56:23.577
So how do you think
it's going to go?


869
00:56:23.578 --> 00:56:27.917
Well, I think
it's going to go pretty well.


870
00:56:29.917 --> 00:56:31.753
I think people are
going to be surprised


871
00:56:31.754 --> 00:56:32.893
at what they see.

872
00:56:37.539 --> 00:56:39.059
I mean, it doesn't have
a twist ending,


873
00:56:39.060 --> 00:56:40.100
but it's going to be good.

874
00:56:43.065 --> 00:56:45.270
It's fast paced.
It's colorful.


875
00:56:49.270 --> 00:56:50.872
I put some of my music in there,

876
00:56:50.873 --> 00:56:52.206
<i>as well as some National music.</i>

877
00:56:52.207 --> 00:56:53.673
I don't want to know
too much about it.


878
00:56:53.674 --> 00:56:54.674
I know.

879
00:56:56.044 --> 00:56:57.884
Tom, did you ever
get in touch with that girl?


880
00:56:59.748 --> 00:57:01.051
Actually-
- No, no.

881
00:57:04.051 --> 00:57:05.820
I don't want a girlfriend
just right now.


882
00:57:05.821 --> 00:57:08.856
I don't have the clothes to wear

883
00:57:08.857 --> 00:57:12.093
that they probably want me
to go out and wear.


884
00:57:12.094 --> 00:57:15.266
I don't have the bed
that they probably want.


885
00:57:18.266 --> 00:57:19.834
I don't have the shit.

886
00:57:19.835 --> 00:57:21.640
Like, I don't have any dishes.

887
00:57:24.640 --> 00:57:25.840
I don't have fucking anything.

888
00:57:28.009 --> 00:57:29.142
You have dishes.

889
00:57:29.143 --> 00:57:31.746
No, I don't have dishes.

890
00:57:31.747 --> 00:57:33.648
I thought you did.

891
00:57:33.649 --> 00:57:34.849
Yeah, it's expensive here.

892
00:57:34.850 --> 00:57:36.918
Don't you eat the stuff
in the fridge?


893
00:57:36.919 --> 00:57:38.519
No, I don't really
fix stuff for myself.


894
00:57:40.154 --> 00:57:41.923
Well, where do you eat?

895
00:57:41.924 --> 00:57:44.090
Other than our food?

896
00:57:44.091 --> 00:57:49.262
Well, you can get slices
of pizza pretty cheap.


897
00:57:49.263 --> 00:57:51.666
Here and there.
Pizza slice here.


898
00:57:51.667 --> 00:57:52.770
Pizza slice there.

899
00:57:55.770 --> 00:57:57.872
Chinese food every couple days.

900
00:57:57.873 --> 00:58:00.708
I don't know.

901
00:58:00.709 --> 00:58:02.309
It's going to be good.

902
00:58:02.310 --> 00:58:03.310
It's going to be good.

903
00:58:05.948 --> 00:58:08.319
I'm not feeling very good
at the moment.


904
00:58:10.319 --> 00:58:11.519
I think I'm going to throw up.

905
00:58:13.989 --> 00:58:16.090
No. It will be good.
It'll be over in an hour,


906
00:58:16.091 --> 00:58:17.992
<i>and everybody will go
get to see The National.</i>


907
00:58:17.993 --> 00:58:19.193
Which they came to see anyway.

908
00:58:23.131 --> 00:58:24.698
It's just a rough cut.

909
00:58:24.699 --> 00:58:27.001
I spent about six months
to about eight months,


910
00:58:27.002 --> 00:58:28.101
traveling with these guys.

911
00:58:28.102 --> 00:58:29.970
And this is my impression
of the band.


912
00:58:29.971 --> 00:58:33.006
Thank you, everybody,
and, yeah, that's it.


913
00:58:33.007 --> 00:58:34.844
Thank you!

914
00:58:58.366 --> 00:58:59.366
Oops!

915
00:59:01.069 --> 00:59:02.274
Why is this happening to me?

916
00:59:06.274 --> 00:59:07.242
I don't know.

917
00:59:07.243 --> 00:59:10.245
The digital projector
keeps stopping and--


918
00:59:12.013 --> 00:59:13.792
It's not over.

919
00:59:23.792 --> 00:59:26.459
You should have been in there,

920
00:59:26.460 --> 00:59:27.994
hours and hours ahead.

921
00:59:27.995 --> 00:59:29.030
Or, you should have gone
the day before


922
00:59:29.031 --> 00:59:31.331
to make sure
everything was working.


923
00:59:31.332 --> 00:59:33.800
I felt terrible for you.

924
00:59:33.801 --> 00:59:37.137
But I was also
totally pissed off.


925
00:59:37.138 --> 00:59:40.474
How did you let bad luck
stop you again?


926
00:59:40.475 --> 00:59:41.844
Everyone has bad luck.

927
00:59:42.844 --> 00:59:43.977
It's easier for you to say

928
00:59:43.978 --> 00:59:47.514
when everything seems to be
going right in your life.


929
00:59:47.515 --> 00:59:50.084
But it doesn't.

930
00:59:50.085 --> 00:59:55.423
Stuff goes as wrong for me
as it does for you.


931
00:59:55.424 --> 00:59:56.893
I have been lucky.

932
00:59:57.893 --> 01:00:00.894
Maybe I have been luckier
than you have.


933
01:00:00.895 --> 01:00:02.095
The worst thing that can happen

934
01:00:02.096 --> 01:00:06.968
is that you let this
paralyze you again.


935
01:00:06.969 --> 01:00:09.070
And suck all your air out.

936
01:00:09.071 --> 01:00:10.470
I'm seeing this

937
01:00:10.471 --> 01:00:15.379
as a fortuitous opportunity
to re-cut a few things.


938
01:00:17.379 --> 01:00:19.579
And I'm not depressed.

939
01:00:19.580 --> 01:00:20.580
Okay. Good.

940
01:00:24.352 --> 01:00:25.852
Tom, are you depressed
right now?


941
01:00:25.853 --> 01:00:28.255
Yeah. Well, of course!

942
01:00:28.256 --> 01:00:29.088
I always am.

943
01:00:29.089 --> 01:00:31.194
And it's really hard
to be creative.


944
01:00:33.194 --> 01:00:36.337
I did shoot myself crying
last night.


945
01:00:42.337 --> 01:00:45.171
For the movie?

946
01:00:45.172 --> 01:00:46.273
I needed something--

947
01:00:46.274 --> 01:00:48.575
I don't know, it was real...

948
01:00:48.576 --> 01:00:51.144
Raw emotion that I felt like--

949
01:00:51.145 --> 01:00:53.213
I'm feeling this now...

950
01:00:53.214 --> 01:00:56.050
I might as well get my camera.

951
01:00:56.051 --> 01:00:58.218
You were crying about the movie?

952
01:00:58.219 --> 01:00:59.922
Yeah.

953
01:01:01.922 --> 01:01:03.923
You don't have to cry
about the movie.


954
01:01:03.924 --> 01:01:06.193
It's just a rock documentary.

955
01:01:06.194 --> 01:01:08.229
I'm sorry.

956
01:01:08.230 --> 01:01:09.229
See what I'm saying?

957
01:01:09.230 --> 01:01:10.398
I know it's been
super stressful.


958
01:01:10.399 --> 01:01:13.200
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

959
01:01:13.201 --> 01:01:15.635
I've never seen him cry at all.

960
01:01:15.636 --> 01:01:17.972
He's probably seen me cry,
like, four times.


961
01:01:17.973 --> 01:01:19.572
I've seen you cry, like,
a hundred times.


962
01:01:19.573 --> 01:01:21.145
I've never seen you cry.

963
01:01:23.145 --> 01:01:24.580
I cry.

964
01:01:26.580 --> 01:01:28.051
I just want to make
something good.


965
01:01:30.051 --> 01:01:31.985
For him.

966
01:01:31.986 --> 01:01:35.655
For the band, to believe in me.

967
01:01:35.656 --> 01:01:39.641
As well as myself.

968
01:01:53.641 --> 01:01:55.175
Welcome to Paris.

969
01:01:55.176 --> 01:01:56.736
Oh. This doesn't even look
like my arm.


970
01:01:59.214 --> 01:02:01.334
Looks like another person
in the room when I do this.


971
01:02:02.417 --> 01:02:03.857
All right.
Sit down, Matt. Sit down.


972
01:02:06.187 --> 01:02:08.354
What's it like--
I mean...


973
01:02:08.355 --> 01:02:10.090
Tonight, you're
going to be playing


974
01:02:10.091 --> 01:02:13.260
in front of 5,000?

975
01:02:13.261 --> 01:02:17.131
I can't believe...
I can't imagine playing--


976
01:02:17.132 --> 01:02:19.339
I don't think I ever met
more than 5,000 people.


977
01:02:25.339 --> 01:02:27.140
That's amazing!

978
01:02:27.141 --> 01:02:29.242
Yeah. I know it is amazing.

979
01:02:29.243 --> 01:02:32.216
It's pretty nerve-racking
but it's awesome.


980
01:02:35.216 --> 01:02:38.651
For so long, we would go on tour

981
01:02:38.652 --> 01:02:39.733
and no one would be coming.

982
01:02:41.623 --> 01:02:44.090
It was so humiliating for us.

983
01:02:44.091 --> 01:02:46.093
And that happened a lot!

984
01:02:46.094 --> 01:02:49.963
And I remember the first time
we played at Mercury Lounge.


985
01:02:49.964 --> 01:02:52.465
And there was nobody there.

986
01:02:52.466 --> 01:02:55.001
After that show,
I went straight home,


987
01:02:55.002 --> 01:02:57.276
closed the door
and started crying.


988
01:03:01.276 --> 01:03:05.044
I think when we started
putting tension and anxiety


989
01:03:05.045 --> 01:03:10.450
and fear and humiliation
into the music,


990
01:03:10.451 --> 01:03:11.623
just putting it out there,

991
01:03:14.623 --> 01:03:16.624
it made us closer to each other.

992
01:03:16.625 --> 01:03:19.226
And for the people
that did come to the shows,


993
01:03:19.227 --> 01:03:20.227
that was the connection.

994
01:03:37.212 --> 01:03:39.345
<i>Where were you?
Who were you with?</i>


995
01:03:39.346 --> 01:03:40.613
<i>I was with Bryan and Scott!</i>

996
01:03:40.614 --> 01:03:42.219
<i>They were on the bus!</i>

997
01:03:44.980 --> 01:03:46.220
<i>But you needed to do something</i>

998
01:03:46.221 --> 01:03:48.122
<i>and complete something.</i>

999
01:03:48.123 --> 01:03:49.596
<i>You always wanted
to quit things.</i>


1000
01:03:54.382 --> 01:03:55.662
<i>The worst thing that can happen</i>

1001
01:03:55.663 --> 01:04:01.068
<i>is if you let this
paralyze you again</i>


1002
01:04:01.069 --> 01:04:02.446
<i>and suck all your air out.</i>

1003
01:04:11.446 --> 01:04:13.350
Having Matt as my older brother

1004
01:04:16.350 --> 01:04:18.785
kind of sucks.

1005
01:04:18.786 --> 01:04:24.062
Because he's a rock star
and I am not.


1006
01:04:27.062 --> 01:04:28.342
And it has always been that way.

1007
01:04:32.067 --> 01:04:34.235
But there was this one time

1008
01:04:34.236 --> 01:04:36.403
when I was in high school

1009
01:04:36.404 --> 01:04:38.137
and he was in New York.

1010
01:04:38.138 --> 01:04:39.606
And he called me up,

1011
01:04:39.607 --> 01:04:41.742
because he had
a horrible nightmare.


1012
01:04:41.743 --> 01:04:43.843
And his nightmare was awesome.

1013
01:04:43.844 --> 01:04:45.613
He was being attacked

1014
01:04:45.614 --> 01:04:47.814
by some crazy guy on the street.

1015
01:04:47.815 --> 01:04:51.785
And he said that I came
out of nowhere with an axe


1016
01:04:51.786 --> 01:04:54.324
and I just axed
this crazy guy to death.


1017
01:04:57.324 --> 01:04:58.324
I mean, I saved his life!

1018
01:05:02.129 --> 01:05:04.764
It's just
that that made me realize


1019
01:05:04.765 --> 01:05:08.302
that my brother sees
something in me


1020
01:05:08.303 --> 01:05:11.745
that I, you know,
sometimes don't see in myself.


1021
01:05:16.745 --> 01:05:19.380
I want you to wipe
right across your eyes


1022
01:05:19.381 --> 01:05:20.901
so I can get a good shot
of your eyes.


1023
01:05:22.683 --> 01:05:24.385
- Across the mirror.
- Yeah.


1024
01:05:24.386 --> 01:05:27.820
And you got to have that look
of you don't know who--


1025
01:05:27.821 --> 01:05:29.289
you don't know
who you are anymore.


1026
01:05:29.290 --> 01:05:30.791
Okay?

1027
01:05:30.792 --> 01:05:32.559
Okay.

1028
01:05:32.560 --> 01:05:33.703
And action.

1029
01:05:42.703 --> 01:05:43.703
Hold on.
Let me zoom in.


1030
01:05:46.241 --> 01:05:50.476
<i>Say I am not The National.</i>

1031
01:05:50.477 --> 01:05:52.313
<i>The National is everybody's now.</i>

1032
01:05:52.314 --> 01:05:53.514
Say that!
Actually, that's good!


1033
01:05:53.515 --> 01:05:54.548
Just say it.

1034
01:05:54.549 --> 01:05:56.886
You don't think I sound
like a total asshole?


1035
01:05:57.886 --> 01:06:00.725
I'll say it.
I will say it.


1036
01:06:03.338 --> 01:06:04.858
<i>The National belongs
to everybody now.</i>


1037
01:06:04.859 --> 01:06:06.665
Nope. No.

1038
01:06:10.665 --> 01:06:12.633
- Look at me.
- Okay.


1039
01:06:12.634 --> 01:06:13.634
<i>The National...</i>

1040
01:06:16.504 --> 01:06:18.819
<i>The National belongs
to everybody now.</i>


1041
01:06:30.819 --> 01:06:32.625
Keep doing that!
Keep doing that!


1042
01:06:37.625 --> 01:06:39.665
I zoomed in on your face!

1043
01:06:43.544 --> 01:06:44.865
This might be good
for the ending!


1044
01:06:44.866 --> 01:06:46.634
Do one more of those!

1045
01:06:47.634 --> 01:06:51.338
Tom, you focus on
the wrong stuff.


1046
01:06:51.339 --> 01:06:52.905
It's true.

1047
01:06:52.906 --> 01:06:55.843
You are terrible
at a lot of things.


1048
01:06:55.844 --> 01:06:57.910
But there are a couple of things

1049
01:06:57.911 --> 01:07:01.715
that nobody else does
as well as you do.


1050
01:07:01.716 --> 01:07:03.349
It drives me bananas

1051
01:07:03.350 --> 01:07:05.885
that you will throw yourself
away completely


1052
01:07:05.886 --> 01:07:07.988
because of one or two things

1053
01:07:07.989 --> 01:07:10.495
that you think
are wrong about you.


1054
01:07:13.495 --> 01:07:14.616
That's what breaks my heart.

1055
01:07:16.598 --> 01:07:20.633
You got to ignore those,
and lean towards the things


1056
01:07:20.634 --> 01:07:22.535
that make you like yourself.

1057
01:07:22.536 --> 01:07:23.771
Forget everything else.

1058
01:07:23.772 --> 01:07:26.413
Fake it.
Fake your way upwards.


1059
01:07:32.413 --> 01:07:33.413
Hey, Tom.

1060
01:07:33.948 --> 01:07:35.983
Tom!

1061
01:07:35.984 --> 01:07:37.254
Will you get out of here!

1062
01:07:39.254 --> 01:07:40.753
Is it off?

1063
01:07:40.754 --> 01:07:41.755
I turned it off.

1064
01:07:41.756 --> 01:07:43.322
I'm leaving!

1065
01:07:43.323 --> 01:07:44.462
Put the camera down.

1066
01:07:47.462 --> 01:07:48.628
It's off.

1067
01:07:48.629 --> 01:07:50.703
- Alright. It's off.
- Is it off?


1068
01:07:55.703 --> 01:07:57.503
I'm just checking the progress.

1069
01:07:57.504 --> 01:07:58.671
I'm getting close.

1070
01:07:58.672 --> 01:07:59.807
Alright.

1071
01:07:59.808 --> 01:08:01.448
Just let me figure it out, okay?
