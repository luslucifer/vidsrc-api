Even I want to have.

1308
02:04:23.171 --> 02:04:23.838
What about sugar and tea-leaves?

1309
02:04:29.171 --> 02:04:29.755
Here you go.

1310
02:04:53.005 --> 02:04:56.421
Raja, they are 50-60 policemen.

1311
02:04:58.963 --> 02:04:59.880
We can fight with 20 each.

1312
02:05:15.463 --> 02:05:18.880
Raja, they have arrested our uncle.

1313
02:05:32.005 --> 02:05:33.171
Uncle will be killed.

1314
02:05:47.463 --> 02:05:47.880
[GUN SHOT]

1315
02:05:51.380 --> 02:05:55.713
Raja, he shot our uncle.

1316
02:05:56.213 --> 02:05:57.921
He wasn't ours, he was a stranger.

1317
02:05:58.796 --> 02:05:59.421
What do you mean?

1318
02:06:00.380 --> 02:06:01.046
He was a cheater.

1319
02:06:09.588 --> 02:06:13.463
My mom used to say, friendship of a
bad man can put your life in danger.


1320
02:06:15.963 --> 02:06:18.463
Raja, we are about to die.

1321
02:06:19.213 --> 02:06:21.963
Till we are alive, time is ours.

1322
02:06:26.213 --> 02:06:28.338
We should let fox taste the grapes.

1323
02:06:44.963 --> 02:06:46.255
When fox isn't eating the grapes

1324
02:06:47.296 --> 02:06:51.380
then take back the grapes from it.

1325
02:08:11.380 --> 02:08:13.505
Teere...Teere...

1326
02:08:14.380 --> 02:08:15.255
Shishi...

1327
02:08:18.755 --> 02:08:19.380
Raja

1328
02:08:29.505 --> 02:08:30.255
Raja

1329
02:08:31.463 --> 02:08:33.088
They are asking us to surrender.

1330
02:09:28.130 --> 02:09:30.338
Raja, you are doing wrong.

1331
02:09:31.130 --> 02:09:32.921
Raja has done wrong all his life.

1332
02:09:33.921 --> 02:09:36.963
First mistake to be
born in the poor family.

1333
02:09:37.296 --> 02:09:38.005
[GUN SHOT]

1334
02:09:42.713 --> 02:09:47.671
Second mistake to dream for
winning national competition.


1335
02:09:49.130 --> 02:09:54.338
Third mistake, to trust friendship.

1336
02:09:57.171 --> 02:10:00.921
Fourth mistake, Raja knows that
earth is into wrong hands.


1337
02:10:01.088 --> 02:10:01.796
[GUN SHOT]

1338
02:10:08.755 --> 02:10:10.255
Till when this toy is in the hand

1339
02:10:11.463 --> 02:10:14.005
earth also bears me happily.

1340
02:10:15.880 --> 02:10:17.963
And sky also ready to bow.

1341
02:10:20.088 --> 02:10:21.796
Tell me if you have any last wish?

1342
02:10:24.213 --> 02:10:25.588
I want to win a race from you.

1343
02:10:27.463 --> 02:10:28.380
By cheating?

1344
02:10:29.130 --> 02:10:29.630
No.

1345
02:10:30.838 --> 02:10:31.713
It'll be honest.

1346
02:10:38.171 --> 02:10:40.671
Ask your men not to interfere.

1347
02:10:41.338 --> 02:10:42.380
They won't.

1348
02:11:00.171 --> 02:11:01.630
From here to Kiln bridge.

1349
02:13:17.505 --> 02:13:18.213
[GUN SHOT]

1350
02:13:43.796 --> 02:13:45.588
Again you lost the
race at the winning line.

1351
02:13:57.796 --> 02:13:58.630
I didn't lose.

1352
02:14:00.255 --> 02:14:00.796
You lost.

1353
02:14:04.505 --> 02:14:06.421
You were behind me
in the race of life,

1354
02:14:07.713 --> 02:14:08.505
in college.

1355
02:14:10.838 --> 02:14:11.546
and in uniform too.

1356
02:14:13.880 --> 02:14:19.171
I'm ahead of you
in the race of death.

1357
02:14:20.546 --> 02:14:21.130
[GUN SHOT]

1358
02:15:51.463 --> 02:15:52.213
[DOOR KNOCK]

1359
02:15:52.713 --> 02:15:53.463
I'm coming.

1360
02:16:05.088 --> 02:16:06.213
Who are you?

1361
02:16:07.380 --> 02:16:08.505
I didn't recognise you.

1362
02:16:09.088 --> 02:16:10.588
Raja has sent me.

1363
02:16:13.838 --> 02:16:16.213
This house has a bad omen
over happiness.


1364
02:16:17.796 --> 02:16:19.213
Don't crack jokes like that.

1365
02:16:26.088 --> 02:16:27.130
What do you want?

1366
02:16:29.713 --> 02:16:33.255
This Medal belongs to Raja, as
much it belongs to me.


1367
02:17:21.380 --> 02:17:22.755
Mr Raja can you see me?

1368
02:17:23.588 --> 02:17:31.088
If you will get a chance to run
for Punjab. Will you?


1369
02:17:31.880 --> 02:17:32.921
I was born to run.

1370
02:17:33.880 --> 02:17:35.505
This is syestem's problem.

1371
02:17:36.963 --> 02:17:40.171
Can you tell us your current location?

1372
02:17:40.171 --> 02:17:42.088
Weather you in India or abroad?

1373
02:17:43.463 --> 02:17:44.213
You'll be informed soon.
