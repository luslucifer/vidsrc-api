1
00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:58.120
My gratitude to you all.

2
00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:02.360
Many years have passed since your prince
has tread upon his native soil.


3
00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:07.440
So let us now welcome home
T'Challa, the son of Wakanda.


4
00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:14.560
- They hate me.
- Give it time.


5
00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:18.480
Intruders! Intruders!

6
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.680
Father, you are in no condition
to deal with this.


7
00:01:29.715 --> 00:01:32.360
I implore you to listen
to the prince, Your Highness.


8
00:01:32.395 --> 00:01:34.680
You have yet to heal
from the previous attacks!


9
00:01:34.715 --> 00:01:36.365
- The royal guard should...
- No, Nakinda.


10
00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:41.200
- We cannot afford to lose any more.
- Father, please, don't go. Not now.


11
00:01:41.235 --> 00:01:45.320
I've missed you, son.
We will have our time together.


12
00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:46.525
I promise.

13
00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.200
At least allow me to go with you.

14
00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.840
As you will one day come to accept...

15
00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.760
this responsibility belongs
only to the king.


16
00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:40.080
Your prowess in battle
never fails to entertain.


17
00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:43.420
But after so many performances...

18
00:02:43.455 --> 00:02:46.720
I am here to insure your retirement.

19
00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:02.240
Father!

20
00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:06.280
So, the prodigal prince has returned.

21
00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:10.600
Now the royal bloodline
can finally end here.


22
00:03:10.635 --> 00:03:13.857
All over the jungle floor.

23
00:03:13.892 --> 00:03:17.080
You will not touch my son!

24
00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:25.080
Father!

25
00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:36.000
Father.

26
00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:49.720
No!

27
00:05:58.640 --> 00:05:59.840
Father.

28
00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:09.520
Your Highness.

29
00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:13.320
Come with me.

30
00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:20.280
The Eye of Kings.

31
00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:26.400
The right of access has now been
handed down to you.


32
00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:19.400
- You were supposed to call for backup.
- I didn't need it.


33
00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:21.600
This is the last time
you do this to me.


34
00:08:21.635 --> 00:08:23.840
And look! You're wounded again.

35
00:08:23.880 --> 00:08:27.920
Steve, I know what you're doing.
Believe me, I have been there.


36
00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:31.840
You cannot fill your life with this.
It will kill you.


37
00:08:32.080 --> 00:08:33.440
Then let it.

38
00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:49.440
So what are we now?
A one man army?


39
00:08:49.480 --> 00:08:51.125
You left me no choice.

40
00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:55.360
I'm just doing my job, General. That's
why you thawed me out for, isn't it?


41
00:08:55.520 --> 00:08:58.920
You wanna be back on ice? Is that it?
Because that's where you're headed.


42
00:08:58.955 --> 00:09:01.520
- Feet first, with a toe tag.
- If you'll excuse me, Sir,


43
00:09:01.555 --> 00:09:03.880
I'm signed on with Bravo team
for a warehouse raid.


44
00:09:03.915 --> 00:09:05.240
Not any more.

45
00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:07.680
What's happened to you, son?

46
00:09:07.960 --> 00:09:10.680
- Why are you such a mess?
- I'm fine, Sir, really.


47
00:09:10.715 --> 00:09:13.400
No, you're not.
You need R and R like anyone else.


48
00:09:13.435 --> 00:09:15.205
- I'm a super soldier!
- You're a man!


49
00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:18.240
Now be straight with me.
Why are you dodging the downtime?


50
00:09:18.275 --> 00:09:19.805
I'd just rather keep busy,
that's all.


51
00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:22.160
You got something against
having a personal life?


52
00:09:22.195 --> 00:09:24.445
It hurts less when
you're fighting, doesn't it?


53
00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:28.180
- You don't know anything about me.
- I know that you are afraid of peace.


54
00:09:28.215 --> 00:09:31.880
Because the moment you have it,
a normal life seems within your grasp,


55
00:09:31.920 --> 00:09:34.200
and you don't want
to lose that again.


56
00:09:34.360 --> 00:09:37.300
Steve, listen. You got a right
to be a little screwed up


57
00:09:37.335 --> 00:09:40.287
after a sixty-year deep freeze.
But that's the past.


58
00:09:40.322 --> 00:09:43.240
You killed the Chitaurii,
you made the world safe again.


59
00:09:43.275 --> 00:09:45.440
It's time to start letting go.

60
00:09:45.800 --> 00:09:46.880
Yes, General.

61
00:09:49.640 --> 00:09:52.660
He will not listen, you know.
He never does.


62
00:09:52.695 --> 00:09:55.680
He'd better,
or I'll lock him up with Banner.


63
00:10:00.880 --> 00:10:05.440
Dr. Banner, please
stay focused on the video.


64
00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:09.280
That's good. Very good.

65
00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:12.920
At which point
did you lose control over Hulk?


66
00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:16.400
Was it here...
Dr. Banner?


67
00:10:16.640 --> 00:10:18.120
I think so!

68
00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:21.400
- Elaborate, please.
- We've been over this!


69
00:10:21.640 --> 00:10:25.720
You do want the court to have a clear
picture of what went on, don't you?


70
00:10:26.280 --> 00:10:28.240
Don't you, Dr. Banner?

71
00:10:28.360 --> 00:10:30.240
Now let's start again.

72
00:10:30.360 --> 00:10:33.400
You made a conscious decision
to become the Hulk.


73
00:10:33.435 --> 00:10:34.565
Why?

74
00:10:34.600 --> 00:10:36.805
We were under attack by aliens.

75
00:10:36.840 --> 00:10:40.840
- Elaborate, please.
- It was the only way to stop them!


76
00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:43.125
The only way?

77
00:10:43.160 --> 00:10:45.600
Are we being honest, Dr. Banner?

78
00:10:45.720 --> 00:10:47.760
Weren't others involved?

79
00:10:47.795 --> 00:10:49.800
The Avengers, perhaps.

80
00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:53.320
Yet when they came to assist,
you turned on them.


81
00:10:53.355 --> 00:10:54.520
Why is that?

82
00:10:54.840 --> 00:10:57.005
Please answer the question.

83
00:10:57.040 --> 00:11:00.860
Here's a question for you, Oiler.
Did you ask for this job?


84
00:11:00.895 --> 00:11:04.680
I mean, I'm the guy who booted
you off the SSP team last year.


85
00:11:04.715 --> 00:11:07.357
- So this is payback, right?
- Dr. Banner!


86
00:11:07.392 --> 00:11:10.000
Attacking others is what you do!
Not me.


87
00:11:10.120 --> 00:11:11.800
I want to see Betty Ross.

88
00:11:12.040 --> 00:11:14.640
She has been made aware
of your request.


89
00:11:14.675 --> 00:11:16.480
Get her down here now!

90
00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:18.880
Hit him with the sedative.

91
00:11:29.720 --> 00:11:33.960
We'll start again once
you've had a chance to... relax.


92
00:11:34.040 --> 00:11:37.320
Keep the video on a continuous loop.

93
00:11:37.600 --> 00:11:38.800
Yes, Doctor.

94
00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:03.280
Who are you?

95
00:13:05.640 --> 00:13:07.760
He's called the Black Panther.

96
00:13:09.160 --> 00:13:12.800
All right, everyone, I got this.
Return to your posts.


97
00:13:12.835 --> 00:13:14.040
You heard him, move it!

98
00:13:18.720 --> 00:13:20.800
A little far from home, aren't you?

99
00:13:23.640 --> 00:13:25.320
Where's T'Challa?

100
00:13:25.880 --> 00:13:29.240
He is... I, am king
of Wakanda now.


101
00:13:29.480 --> 00:13:31.925
And I demand to speak alone
with Captain America.


102
00:13:31.960 --> 00:13:35.160
Now look, your father and I never
got off on the right foot. Why don't


103
00:13:35.195 --> 00:13:38.080
- you and I do things differently?
- It is a private matter.


104
00:13:38.200 --> 00:13:42.000
- I keep no secrets from General Fury.
- My father was killed, four days ago.


105
00:13:42.040 --> 00:13:43.200
By this man.

106
00:13:43.400 --> 00:13:44.440
Kleiser!

107
00:13:45.680 --> 00:13:48.040
I thought he died in 1945.

108
00:13:51.560 --> 00:13:53.600
- I must know how to stop him.
- You can't.


109
00:13:53.635 --> 00:13:54.365
Why?

110
00:13:54.400 --> 00:13:57.200
Because I killed him twice,
and he always comes back.


111
00:13:57.235 --> 00:13:59.085
You need to open your borders.

112
00:13:59.120 --> 00:14:02.000
The Avengers are your only chance
of defeating the Chitaurii.


113
00:14:02.035 --> 00:14:04.085
No. Outsiders are forbidden.

114
00:14:04.120 --> 00:14:06.440
You're the king now,
change that law.


115
00:14:06.480 --> 00:14:09.160
I've betrayed my people enough
just by coming here.


116
00:14:11.560 --> 00:14:13.440
There's nothing you can tell me?

117
00:14:21.960 --> 00:14:23.560
Assemble the Avengers.

118
00:14:38.680 --> 00:14:40.000
You're looking good, hon'!

119
00:14:49.680 --> 00:14:51.920
Just a minor spike
in your insulin levels.


120
00:14:57.080 --> 00:15:00.400
Up the plasma I.G.F.
concentration to 850 u.


121
00:15:03.800 --> 00:15:05.720
Muscular composition is fluctuating.

122
00:15:06.680 --> 00:15:08.600
We're getting a dip
in lean body mass!


123
00:15:11.360 --> 00:15:13.840
Lumbar spine density
is at 84 and rising!


124
00:15:17.440 --> 00:15:20.640
Pulsatile and diurnal outputs
are off the charts!


125
00:15:20.880 --> 00:15:23.360
Hank, you're crashing,
we have to terminate!


126
00:15:23.395 --> 00:15:26.200
No, no! Just get me to 61 ft.

127
00:15:28.440 --> 00:15:29.605
Stabilize him.

128
00:15:29.640 --> 00:15:32.680
Anabolic levels are too erratic,
he's gonna stroke out!


129
00:15:34.800 --> 00:15:36.440
Bring him down, slowly.

130
00:15:36.680 --> 00:15:37.560
Yeah.

131
00:15:44.880 --> 00:15:46.640
You just blew two months of work!

132
00:15:46.675 --> 00:15:48.357
We were beyond the safety margin.

133
00:15:48.392 --> 00:15:50.005
Hank, this is not worth your life!

134
00:15:50.040 --> 00:15:53.320
- My life, my risks!
- No, it's your ego!


135
00:15:53.440 --> 00:15:56.525
60 ft, it's the maximum strain
your body can endure.


136
00:15:56.560 --> 00:16:00.160
Let's just put a pin in it, and refocus
on the other phase of the project.


137
00:16:00.195 --> 00:16:02.720
Other phase?
What, you mean shrinking?


138
00:16:03.240 --> 00:16:05.240
You can put a
pin in that too, Janet.

139
00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:08.140
If we don't start
reconditioning your body,


140
00:16:08.175 --> 00:16:10.280
it will never handle
the reduction in size!


141
00:16:10.315 --> 00:16:11.200
Forget it!

142
00:16:11.480 --> 00:16:14.040
I'm not going back to being
a two-inch superhero.


143
00:16:22.280 --> 00:16:24.960
Janet, you have a call
from General Fury's office.


144
00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:42.800
Tell her we refuse to supply
any transitional hardware


145
00:16:42.835 --> 00:16:45.277
unless their programming is compatible.

146
00:16:45.312 --> 00:16:47.685
Oh and, Jarvis, send her flowers too.

147
00:16:47.720 --> 00:16:50.440
With an apology for...
Well, she'll know.


148
00:16:50.475 --> 00:16:53.085
Certainly, Sir.
And on another matter,


149
00:16:53.120 --> 00:16:56.480
<i>shall I reschedule your meeting
with the company's vice presidents?</i>


150
00:16:56.515 --> 00:16:59.240
No need, I brought them with me.

151
00:17:06.920 --> 00:17:09.280
Sir, I've got General Fury for you.

152
00:17:09.840 --> 00:17:11.600
I have to call him back.

153
00:17:23.400 --> 00:17:24.520
Come on!

154
00:17:35.960 --> 00:17:36.800
Sir?

155
00:17:36.840 --> 00:17:39.320
- What, Jarvis?
- The team is gathering.


156
00:17:39.355 --> 00:17:40.837
Tell Fury to sit tight.

157
00:17:40.872 --> 00:17:42.320
I'll be there when I can.

158
00:17:43.760 --> 00:17:46.520
OK, rest time is over.
Let's go.


159
00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:38.440
Professor Ross!

160
00:18:38.880 --> 00:18:41.600
What could have made it so brittle?

161
00:18:51.520 --> 00:18:56.440
- Hey, Betty!
- Hey, you!


162
00:18:58.360 --> 00:19:00.320
So, how are things going?

163
00:19:01.800 --> 00:19:03.360
We're working things out.

164
00:19:04.080 --> 00:19:06.165
What about you? How's Bruce?

165
00:19:06.200 --> 00:19:08.800
I... haven't been to see him yet.

166
00:19:10.640 --> 00:19:11.920
Daddy's home!

167
00:19:12.680 --> 00:19:14.880
What? No hug for me?

168
00:19:15.800 --> 00:19:18.240
- How about you, big guy?
- Shut up, Stark.


169
00:19:18.880 --> 00:19:21.240
Ah! It's good to be back.

170
00:19:30.400 --> 00:19:32.240
- Bruce?
- Betty!


171
00:19:32.600 --> 00:19:35.640
I'm so glad you're here.
Do you know what's been going on?


172
00:19:35.675 --> 00:19:38.137
Fury has brought me up on charges.

173
00:19:38.172 --> 00:19:40.600
I know. I've been called as a witness.

174
00:19:40.640 --> 00:19:44.960
I realize the Hulk made a disaster of
things, but he did get rid of the aliens.


175
00:19:44.995 --> 00:19:47.085
- No, he didn't.
- What?


176
00:19:47.120 --> 00:19:49.360
- What are you saying?
- They're still out there.


177
00:19:50.080 --> 00:19:52.120
I just thought you should know.

178
00:19:52.600 --> 00:19:55.680
- Wait! What's Fury doing about it?
- Nothing that concerns you.


179
00:19:55.715 --> 00:19:58.480
Please, Betty,
I need something to think about.


180
00:19:58.515 --> 00:20:00.360
Something besides guilt.

181
00:20:02.840 --> 00:20:05.280
We're analyzing the alien wreckage
from the battle.


182
00:20:05.315 --> 00:20:06.480
What have you found?

183
00:20:06.600 --> 00:20:10.720
Not much, but sections of the Vibranium
hull have become brittle.


184
00:20:10.760 --> 00:20:13.080
- We don't know why.
- Can I see a piece of it?


185
00:20:13.115 --> 00:20:14.725
- If we work together...
- Are you insane?


186
00:20:14.760 --> 00:20:17.440
No one wants your help,
and no one trusts you any more.


187
00:20:17.475 --> 00:20:19.200
Betty, don't go, Betty!

188
00:20:27.120 --> 00:20:32.165
Steve, I know about Kleiser.
So, if you'd like to talk...


189
00:20:32.200 --> 00:20:35.560
There's nothing to talk about.
When I find him, I'm going to kill him.


190
00:20:35.680 --> 00:20:36.920
Once and for all.

191
00:20:36.955 --> 00:20:38.160
OK, listen up.

192
00:20:41.480 --> 00:20:45.920
Herr Kleiser, commander of Nazi Germany
covert Totenkopf Division.


193
00:20:47.200 --> 00:20:50.240
Only Kleiser's allegiance
wasn't to the third Reich.


194
00:20:50.440 --> 00:20:53.720
In reality, he was
a Chitaurii shape-shifter.


195
00:20:53.755 --> 00:20:55.560
The only one we know of.

196
00:20:55.680 --> 00:20:57.840
Kind of their super soldier.

197
00:21:04.400 --> 00:21:07.325
He was assumed killed on May 2nd, 1945,

198
00:21:07.360 --> 00:21:10.720
when his nuclear warhead was
sabotaged above the North Atlantic.


199
00:21:19.840 --> 00:21:22.800
So like our Captain,
Kleiser has survived.


200
00:21:22.920 --> 00:21:26.640
We know this because he just
assassinated the king of Wakanda.


201
00:21:26.800 --> 00:21:30.400
That tells me there's some kind
of alien agenda still in play.


202
00:21:30.435 --> 00:21:32.160
What do we know about Wakanda?

203
00:21:32.280 --> 00:21:33.445
Very little.

204
00:21:33.480 --> 00:21:36.720
They're an isolationist nation
we're unable to take a look at.


205
00:21:36.840 --> 00:21:40.360
Satellite surveillance is blocked.
And undercover efforts have failed.


206
00:21:40.520 --> 00:21:43.320
Bottom line:
they don't want us in there.


207
00:21:43.480 --> 00:21:45.840
Sounds like a reason
to pay them a visit.


208
00:21:46.200 --> 00:21:47.920
General, I want to go in alone.

209
00:21:48.120 --> 00:21:50.040
- No one knows Kleiser and...
- Sorry, Cap',


210
00:21:50.080 --> 00:21:52.480
- this one is a team effort.
- He'll kill everyone!


211
00:21:52.515 --> 00:21:54.240
Just let him go, Fury!

212
00:21:54.280 --> 00:21:57.760
If old Stars and Stripes is nursing
a grudge against that alien Nazi,


213
00:21:57.795 --> 00:21:59.045
why drag us into it?

214
00:21:59.080 --> 00:22:01.600
Like I said, it's a team effort.

215
00:22:01.760 --> 00:22:05.060
We go in under the radar, gather
information, and get out fast.


216
00:22:05.095 --> 00:22:08.360
I don't need an international
incident in the middle of all this.


217
00:22:08.400 --> 00:22:10.525
All the more reason
to send me in alone.


218
00:22:10.560 --> 00:22:13.280
This one needs a clear head
in the lead, Captain.


219
00:22:13.315 --> 00:22:15.080
You're carrying too much baggage.

220
00:22:15.115 --> 00:22:17.400
Widow, you'll be in command.

221
00:22:18.240 --> 00:22:19.645
Demoted!

222
00:22:19.680 --> 00:22:22.440
I guess that makes him
Private America, huh?


223
00:22:22.640 --> 00:22:23.885
This is for certain.

224
00:22:23.920 --> 00:22:27.040
The Chitaurii wouldn't assassinate
a king just for kicks.


225
00:22:27.200 --> 00:22:28.960
They're up to something over there.

226
00:22:29.160 --> 00:22:31.000
And I want to know what it is.

227
00:23:12.680 --> 00:23:14.400
- Father?
- T'Challa.


228
00:23:14.435 --> 00:23:16.085
What are you doing here?

229
00:23:16.120 --> 00:23:18.400
I heard you arguing with the elders.

230
00:23:19.360 --> 00:23:21.885
We do not always see eye to eye.

231
00:23:21.920 --> 00:23:24.280
They don't want you to send me
away to school, do they?


232
00:23:24.315 --> 00:23:25.597
No, they do not.

233
00:23:25.632 --> 00:23:26.845
Then why do it?

234
00:23:26.880 --> 00:23:29.660
Because I believe
the future king of Wakanda


235
00:23:29.695 --> 00:23:32.440
should know something
of the outside world.


236
00:23:32.475 --> 00:23:33.725
I do not understand.

237
00:23:33.760 --> 00:23:35.805
Changes are on the horizon, son.

238
00:23:35.840 --> 00:23:38.360
Our nation must know
how to change with it.


239
00:23:38.400 --> 00:23:41.600
- But if the elders believe...
- A good king knows what is right.


240
00:23:41.635 --> 00:23:43.837
Even when others tell him it is wrong.

241
00:23:43.872 --> 00:23:46.040
I do not ever
want to be king, Father.

242
00:23:46.520 --> 00:23:49.640
Some day, T'Challa,
you will be a great leader.


243
00:24:11.160 --> 00:24:14.120
Fan out, 20 meters spread.
And report what you find.


244
00:24:17.920 --> 00:24:19.880
Wasp, check above the canopy.

245
00:24:20.160 --> 00:24:21.040
Got it!

246
00:24:25.120 --> 00:24:29.240
Hey, Cap', you know, ever since
I first learned about you in school,


247
00:24:29.280 --> 00:24:32.800
- there's something I've wanted to know.
- Is this really the best time, Tony?


248
00:24:32.835 --> 00:24:35.445
- Well, there may not be another time.
- What is it?


249
00:24:35.480 --> 00:24:38.520
When you decided to jump out
of this rocket, back in 1945,


250
00:24:38.555 --> 00:24:40.200
did you think
you'd come out of it alive?


251
00:24:40.800 --> 00:24:41.800
Non.

252
00:24:42.160 --> 00:24:45.620
- Really? You're a better man than me.
- That's not true.


253
00:24:45.655 --> 00:24:49.080
Hey, I'm fine with it. You got
the guts, I go for the glory.


254
00:24:49.115 --> 00:24:51.005
I'm not interested
in posthumous awards.


255
00:24:51.040 --> 00:24:53.080
You'll never really know
until the time comes.


256
00:25:02.200 --> 00:25:04.000
Taylor, report. Taylor!

257
00:25:13.440 --> 00:25:14.600
I'm sorry, Cap'!

258
00:25:52.840 --> 00:25:54.640
- Stop!
- Panther!


259
00:25:54.720 --> 00:25:57.120
- You should not be here.
- It's all right.


260
00:25:57.155 --> 00:25:58.645
You must leave immediately!

261
00:25:58.680 --> 00:26:02.560
We came for answers, and we're not
going anywhere until we get them.


262
00:26:07.240 --> 00:26:09.040
I will not warn you again.

263
00:26:09.080 --> 00:26:10.885
Please, you wanted my help,

264
00:26:10.920 --> 00:26:13.120
- I'm here to give it to you.
- I sought your advice.


265
00:26:13.155 --> 00:26:14.325
Not your involvement.

266
00:26:14.360 --> 00:26:17.045
This man, Kleiser,
he killed your father,


267
00:26:17.080 --> 00:26:19.560
but he also killed
many people very close to me.


268
00:26:19.600 --> 00:26:22.000
You and I, we're after the same thing.

269
00:26:22.080 --> 00:26:27.240
All right, come with me. But only you.
The others must return to their ship.


270
00:26:35.560 --> 00:26:36.440
Come.

271
00:26:38.320 --> 00:26:40.680
- You must not be seen.
- Why?


272
00:26:41.720 --> 00:26:44.480
Wouldn't your people understand
if you told them we were here to help?


273
00:26:44.515 --> 00:26:46.960
No. Because we never needed any help.

274
00:27:07.200 --> 00:27:08.920
Is that a Chitaurii ship?

275
00:27:09.040 --> 00:27:12.640
Yes, shot down in 1942.
Come this way.


276
00:27:12.675 --> 00:27:13.800
Wait...

277
00:27:16.080 --> 00:27:17.520
Your people shot it down?

278
00:27:17.760 --> 00:27:21.080
There's more to Wakanda
than what appears on the surface.


279
00:28:04.240 --> 00:28:05.720
What is this place?

280
00:28:05.840 --> 00:28:10.560
The Hall of Kings. All of
our past leaders are interred here.


281
00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:12.840
This one holds my grandfather.

282
00:28:13.040 --> 00:28:18.200
Azari the Wise. It was during his reign
that the Chitaurii first arrived.


283
00:28:18.440 --> 00:28:21.640
My grandfather met with their leader
in hope of advancing peace.


284
00:28:21.680 --> 00:28:25.280
That leader... was Kleiser.
But Kleiser didn't want peace.


285
00:28:25.320 --> 00:28:28.360
He wanted war,
and the very life blood of our land.


286
00:28:28.395 --> 00:28:29.440
Life blood?

287
00:28:30.040 --> 00:28:34.960
Our most sacred possession.
We call it the Heart of Wakanda.


288
00:28:36.080 --> 00:28:38.520
Kleiser sought to take it by force.

289
00:28:42.480 --> 00:28:43.845
The Wakandans rose up,

290
00:28:43.880 --> 00:28:47.680
and eventually defeated them.
But our nation was deeply scarred.


291
00:28:47.720 --> 00:28:51.760
We became an untrusting people, and
all trespassers became our enemy.


292
00:28:51.795 --> 00:28:55.285
So, what could Kleiser be planning now?
Do you have any idea?


293
00:28:55.320 --> 00:29:00.320
No. But I believe my father did. He had
been preparing me for this very time.


294
00:29:00.640 --> 00:29:02.960
I intend to avenge his death, Captain.

295
00:29:03.320 --> 00:29:05.485
I understand.
More than you know.


296
00:29:05.520 --> 00:29:08.320
- Sire! Intruders have been...
- Nakinda!


297
00:29:08.360 --> 00:29:10.000
What have you done?

298
00:29:13.360 --> 00:29:15.080
They have found your friends.

299
00:29:19.040 --> 00:29:21.360
Come out, come out!
Wherever you are!


300
00:29:31.960 --> 00:29:33.560
Don't make me hurt you!

301
00:29:38.080 --> 00:29:40.440
Knock it...
Knock it off!


302
00:29:46.320 --> 00:29:47.720
Get away from him!

303
00:30:03.600 --> 00:30:06.480
Spears? I'm afraid you'll have
to do better than that!


304
00:30:07.800 --> 00:30:08.840
Or not.

305
00:30:15.080 --> 00:30:16.680
Well, that's embarrassing.

306
00:30:23.040 --> 00:30:24.640
End this fighting now!

307
00:30:28.800 --> 00:30:34.120
I said stop! It is I who allowed
these outsiders to be here.


308
00:30:36.320 --> 00:30:37.925
Hank's been poisoned!

309
00:30:37.960 --> 00:30:39.800
I will provide him with an antidote,

310
00:30:39.835 --> 00:30:41.760
but only if you leave here now.

311
00:30:43.720 --> 00:30:47.160
And if you return, they will kill you.

312
00:30:56.640 --> 00:30:59.520
I recommend regrouping with
additional forces, General.


313
00:30:59.555 --> 00:31:00.645
Then we can return...

314
00:31:00.680 --> 00:31:03.480
I'm not picking a fight with
Wakanda, not until I have to.


315
00:31:03.520 --> 00:31:04.325
But, General...

316
00:31:04.360 --> 00:31:07.720
- Return to base for Cap's debriefing.
- Yes, Sir.


317
00:31:08.440 --> 00:31:11.520
General, Prof. Ross is still waiting
for you in the hangar.


318
00:31:11.555 --> 00:31:14.560
Tell her I'm on my way.
Any progress on locating Thor?


319
00:31:14.595 --> 00:31:15.525
Sorry, Sir.

320
00:31:15.560 --> 00:31:18.560
He's been a no show at every
environmental protest on the planet.


321
00:31:18.600 --> 00:31:21.560
Keep checking every hippy rally
you can think of.


322
00:31:29.200 --> 00:31:31.920
Father, I seek your guidance.

323
00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:48.520
The death vision I have been given...

324
00:31:48.760 --> 00:31:52.480
Reveal to me...
what does it portend?


325
00:31:52.515 --> 00:31:54.520
What befalls the Avengers?

326
00:32:00.840 --> 00:32:02.080
I must warn them!

327
00:32:02.120 --> 00:32:05.040
Midgaard has turned
its back on the gods.


328
00:32:05.075 --> 00:32:07.960
You are not to become involved, my son.

329
00:32:07.995 --> 00:32:09.645
But I am involved.

330
00:32:09.680 --> 00:32:13.400
You have meddled in the affairs
of man far too often.


331
00:32:13.435 --> 00:32:15.677
Now leave them to their fate.

332
00:32:15.712 --> 00:32:17.920
Father, I must do what is right.

333
00:32:17.960 --> 00:32:20.280
I forbid you from aiding them.

334
00:32:21.200 --> 00:32:23.720
Return to Asgaard, at once.

335
00:32:23.755 --> 00:32:26.360
I cannot. Forgive me.

336
00:33:01.640 --> 00:33:03.520
Prof. Ross.
What do you have?


337
00:33:03.680 --> 00:33:07.000
This. The inner core of each ship
possessed a block


338
00:33:07.035 --> 00:33:09.400
of Vibranium denser
than any I've seen yet.


339
00:33:09.435 --> 00:33:11.080
Some kind of power source?

340
00:33:11.115 --> 00:33:12.280
I think so.

341
00:33:12.360 --> 00:33:15.640
We know Vibranium absorbs energy.
So, it makes sense.


342
00:33:16.080 --> 00:33:18.760
Now, watch what happens
when I try to tap into it.


343
00:33:34.320 --> 00:33:36.565
There's probably enough energy
stored in that cube


344
00:33:36.600 --> 00:33:40.080
to power New-York for six months.
I can't even get a reading.


345
00:33:40.200 --> 00:33:42.400
What about
the brittle sections of the hull?


346
00:33:42.440 --> 00:33:44.280
- Any connection?
- I doubt it.


347
00:33:44.360 --> 00:33:48.080
But they do seem to be concentrated
in one general area.


348
00:33:57.640 --> 00:34:03.200
Now, when you developed the super soldier
formula only for yourself,


349
00:34:03.240 --> 00:34:05.720
did you feel remorse
over the deception?


350
00:34:06.120 --> 00:34:08.125
I need to see Professor Ross.

351
00:34:08.160 --> 00:34:10.580
Please answer the question, Dr. Banner.

352
00:34:10.615 --> 00:34:13.000
No, look! That's the answer!
Right there!


353
00:34:13.040 --> 00:34:15.205
Dr. Banner, try to stay focused...

354
00:34:15.240 --> 00:34:18.080
Shut up, you pandering quack,
and get me Betty Ross!


355
00:34:20.360 --> 00:34:23.760
No! I have to tell her!
I have the answer! I...


356
00:34:25.600 --> 00:34:28.485
Dr. Oiler, isn't that an unsafe dosage?

357
00:34:28.520 --> 00:34:32.200
What's unsafe is letting that man
get too angry again.


358
00:34:46.880 --> 00:34:48.560
There's a Chitaurii down there.

359
00:34:52.640 --> 00:34:55.440
There's nothing we can do.
We've been ordered back to base.


360
00:35:02.360 --> 00:35:04.160
Steve, don't do this!

361
00:35:14.280 --> 00:35:16.560
- Follow that shuttle!
- Let him go!


362
00:35:17.040 --> 00:35:20.400
I mean it! If the guy wants to go rogue,
who are we to stop him?


363
00:35:20.435 --> 00:35:23.177
Are you serious?
You'd leave him down there to die?


364
00:35:23.212 --> 00:35:25.920
Hey, if you ask me,
he'd be doing this team a favor.


365
00:35:26.720 --> 00:35:28.440
I can't believe you just said that.

366
00:35:28.480 --> 00:35:31.760
OK, this ship's suddenly
gotten very small.


367
00:35:32.360 --> 00:35:34.645
You know what, Hank?
I'm done with this!


368
00:35:34.680 --> 00:35:39.200
I'm done massaging your ego,
I'm done defending you to everyone!


369
00:35:39.235 --> 00:35:41.040
And I'm done supporting you!

370
00:35:41.080 --> 00:35:44.400
Supporting me?
You have been holding me back!


371
00:35:47.360 --> 00:35:48.760
Don't tempt me.

372
00:35:50.560 --> 00:35:52.325
Honoring the past,

373
00:35:52.360 --> 00:35:55.760
pledging your life to defend
the secrets of our land,


374
00:35:55.795 --> 00:35:58.605
protecting Wakanda
from the outside world.


375
00:35:58.640 --> 00:36:01.240
These are the sacred decrees
you have betrayed!


376
00:36:01.275 --> 00:36:02.765
The decrees are obsolete.

377
00:36:02.800 --> 00:36:05.600
Blindly adhering to them will only
lead to our downfall.


378
00:36:05.635 --> 00:36:08.677
Nakinda, as advisor to the royal family,

379
00:36:08.712 --> 00:36:11.720
do you wish to dispute these charges?

380
00:36:12.080 --> 00:36:14.200
No. I cannot.

381
00:36:14.560 --> 00:36:17.160
These western philosophies...

382
00:36:17.200 --> 00:36:19.485
were learnt beyond our borders.

383
00:36:19.520 --> 00:36:23.245
We warned your father
such ideals would corrupt you.


384
00:36:23.280 --> 00:36:27.580
- My father was a wise man.
- Who made an unwise decision.


385
00:36:27.615 --> 00:36:31.880
As such, we are forced to relieve you
of your royal authority.


386
00:36:31.915 --> 00:36:36.000
The elders hereby assume
the mantel of leadership.


387
00:36:58.120 --> 00:37:00.800
- Panther!
- Why have you returned?


388
00:37:00.920 --> 00:37:03.280
For that thing.
I want answers from it.


389
00:37:03.320 --> 00:37:05.680
I have tried.
It offers nothing.


390
00:37:06.440 --> 00:37:09.760
However, perhaps S.H.I.E.L. D
has more successful methods.


391
00:37:09.795 --> 00:37:11.720
We might, let us try.

392
00:37:13.720 --> 00:37:16.040
Agreed, but only if I go with you.

393
00:37:20.840 --> 00:37:24.000
General, the transport ship
is returning to Wakandans airspace.


394
00:37:24.035 --> 00:37:25.400
Patch me through to it.

395
00:37:31.840 --> 00:37:33.885
I arrive with news of the Chitaurii.

396
00:37:33.920 --> 00:37:36.365
You're a little late,
we already know about them.


397
00:37:36.400 --> 00:37:41.080
The real danger is not upon the ground,
but in the northern sky.


398
00:37:41.440 --> 00:37:43.400
Reposition the orbital scope.

399
00:38:01.840 --> 00:38:03.560
Have you lost your mind?

400
00:38:04.200 --> 00:38:06.480
We have to find out
what this thing knows.


401
00:38:06.520 --> 00:38:10.000
But by bringing it onboard,
you put all of us at risk!


402
00:38:10.035 --> 00:38:11.800
She's right, you know.

403
00:38:35.920 --> 00:38:37.600
Fire at this position!

404
00:39:05.400 --> 00:39:06.600
No!

405
00:39:21.160 --> 00:39:23.720
Alert the infirmary to expect wounded.

406
00:39:23.800 --> 00:39:25.000
I'll take her.

407
00:39:29.760 --> 00:39:34.000
- Stark, do you need a medic?
- Only if he moonlights as a mechanic.


408
00:39:34.360 --> 00:39:36.200
Just send Jarvis for me.

409
00:39:39.600 --> 00:39:43.440
General, the warship remains
in orbit above Africa.


410
00:39:43.600 --> 00:39:46.760
And now, some kind of energy field
is spreading out from it.


411
00:39:47.440 --> 00:39:49.760
How long before
it encompasses the planet?


412
00:39:50.560 --> 00:39:52.280
Within minutes, Sir.

413
00:40:05.600 --> 00:40:07.285
<i>Somewhere in the African continent,</i>

414
00:40:07.320 --> 00:40:10.040
<i>a translucent membrane
now spreading across the sky,</i>


415
00:40:10.080 --> 00:40:12.000
<i>dimming the light over the entire land.</i>

416
00:40:12.040 --> 00:40:14.765
<i>...apparently flowing from
the enormous alien craft</i>


417
00:40:14.800 --> 00:40:18.720
<i>that remains in a geosynchronous
orbit, eye above Africa.</i>


418
00:40:43.200 --> 00:40:46.480
You're quite correct, Sir.
A most alarming development.


419
00:40:46.515 --> 00:40:48.845
So much for Iron Man, version 6.7.

420
00:40:48.880 --> 00:40:51.320
Shall I prepare
a memorial service, Sir?


421
00:40:51.360 --> 00:40:53.640
Nice to see you
so broken up about it.


422
00:40:53.675 --> 00:40:55.445
It was my favorite model.

423
00:40:55.480 --> 00:40:58.320
They were all your favourites
at one time, Sir.


424
00:40:58.355 --> 00:41:01.200
True. Now let's pick up
my next favorite.


425
00:41:06.520 --> 00:41:10.560
I've always fancied the design and
colour scheme of the tailwind model.


426
00:41:10.595 --> 00:41:12.840
Nah, I believe
heavy equipment is in order.


427
00:41:14.160 --> 00:41:17.260
The War Machine,
sturdy, impervious...


428
00:41:17.295 --> 00:41:20.360
And handles like ten tons of tractor.

429
00:41:20.480 --> 00:41:22.920
Yeah, but it's got some sweet guns.

430
00:41:24.680 --> 00:41:25.960
Indeed, Sir.

431
00:41:33.520 --> 00:41:34.400
Bruce!

432
00:41:37.320 --> 00:41:39.920
I was told you had something
urgent to tell me.


433
00:41:48.360 --> 00:41:51.520
- There! You see?
- What?


434
00:41:51.560 --> 00:41:54.040
When the Hulk strikes
the Vibranium hull,


435
00:41:54.075 --> 00:41:55.920
it flashes, just before breaking.

436
00:41:56.800 --> 00:41:59.080
Are those the same areas
that became brittle?


437
00:42:02.760 --> 00:42:04.000
They are!

438
00:42:04.240 --> 00:42:05.440
What's its meaning?

439
00:42:05.475 --> 00:42:06.365
It's gamma!

440
00:42:06.400 --> 00:42:09.560
The Hulk radiates it. I think that's
what weakens the Vibranium.


441
00:42:11.360 --> 00:42:13.920
- That could be it!
- You need to run tests.


442
00:42:13.960 --> 00:42:14.765
How?

443
00:42:14.800 --> 00:42:17.040
There's a small gamma
generator in my lab.


444
00:42:17.075 --> 00:42:18.525
Betty, just get me out of here.

445
00:42:18.560 --> 00:42:21.480
I can't. Fury is the only one
with the release thumb.


446
00:42:21.520 --> 00:42:25.120
- And he doesn't...
- I know. He doesn't trust me.


447
00:42:48.080 --> 00:42:50.040
I'm going to make things right, Jan.

448
00:42:50.840 --> 00:42:52.240
I promise.

449
00:42:53.040 --> 00:42:56.440
I... I can't be the man
you wanted me to be.


450
00:42:58.440 --> 00:42:59.880
What are you doing here?

451
00:42:59.915 --> 00:43:00.845
I am sorry, Hank.

452
00:43:00.880 --> 00:43:03.800
Save it! You know, Jan thought
you were some kind of great hero.


453
00:43:03.835 --> 00:43:06.800
Well thanks, hero! Because of you,
she's in a coma.


454
00:43:06.960 --> 00:43:08.325
Look, I just wanted to...

455
00:43:08.360 --> 00:43:11.040
Get out of here,
before I throw you out!


456
00:43:15.680 --> 00:43:18.960
Move! Get inside!
Seek shelter! Quick!


457
00:44:23.480 --> 00:44:26.360
Stay here until we get
our final orders.


458
00:44:26.395 --> 00:44:27.800
Do you understand?

459
00:44:29.560 --> 00:44:33.440
Do you see now? We will never need
the help of outsiders.


460
00:44:33.475 --> 00:44:35.480
I do not share your confidence.

461
00:45:06.240 --> 00:45:10.080
<i>There is chaos in the streets,
as immense mechanical creatures...</i>


462
00:45:10.120 --> 00:45:12.485
<i>The sky is darkening
over the city as we speak,</i>


463
00:45:12.520 --> 00:45:15.140
<i>releasing an army of unstoppable
machines to the ground.</i>


464
00:45:15.175 --> 00:45:17.760
- General, Wakanda is contacting us.
- Put them through.


465
00:45:18.840 --> 00:45:22.440
General Fury, I am personally
requesting S.H.I.E.L.D.'s assistance.


466
00:45:22.475 --> 00:45:25.317
You and everyone else!
The whole world is under attack.


467
00:45:25.352 --> 00:45:28.160
Yes, but what the aliens are after
is here, in Wakanda.


468
00:45:28.880 --> 00:45:32.040
No more secrets, T'Challa.
What does Kleiser want?


469
00:45:32.075 --> 00:45:34.197
It is what you call Vibranium.

470
00:45:34.232 --> 00:45:36.320
- How much of it?
- A mountain.


471
00:45:36.480 --> 00:45:39.400
An ancient meteorite buried
beneath our land.


472
00:45:39.600 --> 00:45:42.480
And extending to depths
we cannot even imagine.


473
00:45:43.960 --> 00:45:46.045
It has given us protection.

474
00:45:46.080 --> 00:45:50.360
For in its unrefined state, we can
forge it into any weapon we choose.


475
00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:18.180
Without assistance, 
Wakanda will fall.

476
00:46:18.215 --> 00:46:20.360
And so will the rest of the world.

477
00:46:20.960 --> 00:46:24.485
You have betrayed your country
for the last time.


478
00:46:24.520 --> 00:46:28.440
If we do not get help, there will be
nothing left of our country.


479
00:46:53.640 --> 00:46:56.440
They're using our technology
to power their weapons!


480
00:46:56.475 --> 00:46:57.680
Destroy the ship!

481
00:47:28.080 --> 00:47:30.360
- I thought you were all dead.
- Not yet.


482
00:47:36.400 --> 00:47:37.440
Kill them!

483
00:47:52.400 --> 00:47:55.520
I have commanded you to end
your involvement, Thor!


484
00:47:55.560 --> 00:47:58.040
Humanity may have abandoned us, father,

485
00:47:58.075 --> 00:48:00.320
but I will not abandon them!

486
00:49:18.760 --> 00:49:21.560
Now, you die, for the last time.

487
00:49:21.600 --> 00:49:23.160
My words exactly!

488
00:49:45.360 --> 00:49:46.720
Oh no!

489
00:50:03.760 --> 00:50:05.080
It works!

490
00:50:48.520 --> 00:50:49.480
Come on!

491
00:51:00.720 --> 00:51:01.800
No!

492
00:51:15.560 --> 00:51:17.520
Don't kill me, please,
don't kill me!


493
00:51:19.240 --> 00:51:21.000
What? You want that opened?

494
00:51:21.600 --> 00:51:22.720
I can't!

495
00:51:24.040 --> 00:51:27.080
Wait! Wait!
I can kill him for you.


496
00:51:28.120 --> 00:51:29.720
What? No...

497
00:51:31.880 --> 00:51:33.400
No!

498
00:52:14.080 --> 00:52:15.040
Bruce!

499
00:52:21.280 --> 00:52:22.240
Bruce!

500
00:52:23.720 --> 00:52:26.920
That gamma generator...
It worked.


501
00:52:27.080 --> 00:52:30.240
- You were right!
- You have to get it to Fury.


502
00:52:30.275 --> 00:52:32.245
No! We have to get you
out of here!


503
00:52:32.280 --> 00:52:34.720
- It's too late for me.
- Don't say that!


504
00:52:34.960 --> 00:52:38.320
Just turn into the Hulk.
Smash your way out!


505
00:52:38.355 --> 00:52:39.680
I can't.

506
00:52:39.760 --> 00:52:41.720
I won't leave you like this!

507
00:52:42.160 --> 00:52:44.320
Betty, I am sorry...

508
00:52:44.640 --> 00:52:47.400
I am sorry for hurting you.

509
00:52:47.640 --> 00:52:48.960
I love you!

510
00:52:49.400 --> 00:52:51.280
I love you...

511
00:52:52.640 --> 00:52:53.720
Bruce!

512
00:52:57.960 --> 00:52:59.640
We have to go, Betty.

513
00:52:59.720 --> 00:53:02.000
We have to get to the hangar
and get out of here.


514
00:53:46.600 --> 00:53:49.640
This is Widow.
How far out are you?


515
00:53:49.920 --> 00:53:51.080
We'll be ready.

516
00:53:51.120 --> 00:53:52.120
Iron Man!

517
00:53:58.200 --> 00:54:00.000
Sorry for the delay, Natalia.

518
00:54:00.160 --> 00:54:01.600
Got it. On my way.

519
00:54:16.800 --> 00:54:19.360
Be patient! You are next.

520
00:54:46.080 --> 00:54:47.800
We need that distraction now.

521
00:54:49.320 --> 00:54:51.320
Warriors, attack!

522
00:54:54.560 --> 00:54:55.600
Fire!

523
00:54:58.720 --> 00:54:59.680
Fire!

524
00:55:07.440 --> 00:55:09.440
Again! Fire!

525
00:55:12.440 --> 00:55:13.400
Fire!

526
00:55:33.520 --> 00:55:34.960
Nice work, Betty.

527
00:55:35.960 --> 00:55:39.440
It's not the most stylish accessory,
but strap it on.


528
00:55:42.480 --> 00:55:43.440
Janet!

529
00:55:48.760 --> 00:55:50.000
Are you all right?

530
00:55:50.120 --> 00:55:51.640
I'm OK, Hank.

531
00:55:52.880 --> 00:55:55.440
Once you get into the ship,
find the center core.


532
00:55:55.475 --> 00:55:57.440
The Vibranium power source
should be there.


533
00:55:57.475 --> 00:55:59.245
Can you get through its defenses?

534
00:55:59.280 --> 00:56:02.560
Hey, piece of cake!
Except for that big canon.


535
00:56:03.000 --> 00:56:05.000
Not a fan of the big canon.

536
00:56:05.600 --> 00:56:08.365
- Leave that one to me.
- It's all you, buddy!


537
00:56:08.400 --> 00:56:11.680
Hold on! You gonna need someone
watching your back inside that ship.


538
00:56:11.715 --> 00:56:13.280
Hank, what are you doing?

539
00:56:13.520 --> 00:56:16.280
Sorry, big guy,
I've got no room for a passenger.


540
00:56:16.315 --> 00:56:17.600
I know how to make room.

541
00:56:17.640 --> 00:56:19.845
No! Your body can't handle it.

542
00:56:19.880 --> 00:56:22.400
Shrinking now will tear you up inside.

543
00:56:22.435 --> 00:56:24.920
Honey, I'll be fine.
I need to do this.


544
00:56:36.720 --> 00:56:38.080
OK then.

545
00:56:38.320 --> 00:56:39.960
Hank, please.

546
00:56:40.000 --> 00:56:41.660
I told you I'd be fine.

547
00:56:41.695 --> 00:56:43.320
So stop babying me, huh?

548
00:56:49.040 --> 00:56:51.520
Nothing like flying first class!

549
00:57:00.520 --> 00:57:04.760
So, er... If Thor misses, can we
survive a hit form that canon?


550
00:57:04.840 --> 00:57:06.800
Let's just say you won't feel a thing.

551
00:57:07.360 --> 00:57:09.120
OK, we're going in!

552
00:57:20.560 --> 00:57:22.000
- Close your ears, Hank!
- What?


553
00:57:43.680 --> 00:57:45.280
So what are we hoping to find?

554
00:57:45.315 --> 00:57:46.480
The power core.

555
00:58:37.880 --> 00:58:39.880
- Can you make it?
- Yeah.


556
00:58:42.040 --> 00:58:46.360
Foolish boy. Do you think the power
of the Panther will serve you


557
00:58:46.395 --> 00:58:48.200
any better than it did you father?

558
00:58:48.280 --> 00:58:51.520
- You can't kill me.
- He's right.


559
00:58:52.920 --> 00:58:54.800
I don't have to
kill him to stop him.

560
00:58:54.835 --> 00:58:56.680
I just need you
to get him over there.

561
00:58:59.520 --> 00:59:00.325
OK.

562
00:59:00.360 --> 00:59:02.765
<i>Military efforts are failing
while alien forces</i>


563
00:59:02.800 --> 00:59:05.400
<i>continue driving the population
to the center of New-York...</i>


564
00:59:05.435 --> 00:59:07.160
They're coming from
the south and the east.


565
00:59:48.800 --> 00:59:50.640
We have to flood the chamber!

566
00:59:56.920 --> 00:59:59.880
It's not enough!
Break off the nozzles!


567
01:00:20.080 --> 01:00:21.240
We're close.

568
01:00:22.640 --> 01:00:25.440
With these energy readings,
the core must be enormous.


569
01:00:25.480 --> 01:00:27.120
You mean like that thing?

570
01:00:27.155 --> 01:00:28.280
Exactly.

571
01:00:37.200 --> 01:00:38.325
What are you doing?

572
01:00:38.360 --> 01:00:42.000
I'll be all right! Go!
I'll hold them off!


573
01:01:11.600 --> 01:01:13.000
No! No!

574
01:01:51.200 --> 01:01:53.720
Hank! Wake up!

575
01:01:57.040 --> 01:01:58.120
Hank!

576
01:02:09.040 --> 01:02:10.280
I got you, buddy.

577
01:02:31.040 --> 01:02:32.880
Hank! Hank!

578
01:02:33.840 --> 01:02:34.840
No!

579
01:02:38.440 --> 01:02:42.160
See? I told...
I told you I could be...


580
01:02:42.480 --> 01:02:44.400
the man you always...
wanted me to be.


581
01:02:44.435 --> 01:02:46.840
You are, Hank. You are.

582
01:02:56.640 --> 01:02:58.400
It's going to hit the city!

583
01:03:03.400 --> 01:03:06.160
- I think I can deflect it.
- But can you survive that?


584
01:03:06.195 --> 01:03:08.560
If not, I'll take
that posthumous award.


585
01:03:16.600 --> 01:03:19.800
<i>Warning: Fuel cell at 2% and falling.</i>

586
01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:23.000
Divert power from life support.

587

<i>Total system failure in:

01:04:23.760 --> 01:04:25.720
You really are a god.

590
01:04:27.200 --> 01:04:28.680
Your Highness.

591
01:04:34.480 --> 01:04:36.400
What shall we do with Kleiser?

592
01:04:36.600 --> 01:04:37.760
Bury him.

593
01:04:39.280 --> 01:04:40.480
It's over.

594
01:05:16.800 --> 01:05:18.320
Betty...

595
01:05:34.880 --> 01:05:37.200
At least he's still out there, Betty.

596
01:05:45.080 --> 01:05:46.000
Hey!

597
01:06:24.120 --> 01:06:28.680
Steve. Things have been strained
between us lately, and I...


598
01:06:29.960 --> 01:06:34.880
That's in the past. I think we should
start focusing on our future.


599
01:06:43.080 --> 01:06:46.640
Come on, Goldy Locks!
I'll buy you a pint of mead.


600
01:06:50.240 --> 01:06:52.240
It's not every day we save the world.

601
01:06:56.520 --> 01:07:00.400
Actually, General, I have saved
Midgaard on several occasions.


602
01:07:00.435 --> 01:07:03.640
Did you not hear of my victory
over the fire demon Sirta?


603
01:07:03.675 --> 01:07:06.160
They speak of it still
in the halls of Valhalla.
