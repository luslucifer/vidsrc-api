00:00:34.577 --> 00:00:37.583
Tom this is
ground control, over.


3
00:00:37.616 --> 00:00:41.057
Hearing you
loud and clear, over.


4
00:00:42.425 --> 00:00:44.429
We're picking up some
unusual readings down here.


5
00:00:44.464 --> 00:00:47.435
Can you check your
radiation levels?


6
00:00:49.207 --> 00:00:52.213
I'm suddenly detecting
extremely high degrees.


7
00:00:52.245 --> 00:00:53.414
Please advise.

8
00:01:01.531 --> 00:01:05.105
Tom from ground
control do you copy?

00:01:05.139 --> 00:01:07.610
Ground control come in.

10
00:01:07.643 --> 00:01:09.412
Do you read me, over.

11
00:03:42.019 --> 00:03:43.556
Come on, come on.

12
00:03:58.785 --> 00:03:59.787
Jane, Jane.

13
00:04:14.083 --> 00:04:17.689
Breathe.

14
00:04:19.293 --> 00:04:20.729
Breathe, breathe.

15
00:05:02.312 --> 00:05:04.817
Spare some change mate?

16
00:05:13.569 --> 00:05:17.009

cutlery for you alright?


17
00:05:28.798 --> 00:05:30.135
- Alright.
- Right.


18
00:05:30.168 --> 00:05:31.370

19
00:05:31.404 --> 00:05:32.640
A latte.

20
00:05:32.674 --> 00:05:33.808
Latte lovely, do you
fancy anything to eat?


21
00:05:33.841 --> 00:05:34.843
- No.
- No.


22
00:05:39.019 --> 00:05:40.489
Sorry I'll be with
you in a second alright?


23
00:05:40.523 --> 00:05:42.059
Yeah that's alright,
have you got a pen?


24
00:05:42.092 --> 00:05:43.361
- Yes.
- Thanks.


25
00:05:45.566 --> 00:05:49.340
- Heatherfield really?
- Yeah, you know it?


26
00:05:49.373 --> 00:05:51.578
Yeah, yeah my parents
are out that way.


27
00:05:51.611 --> 00:05:53.214
Why Heatherfield?

28
00:05:53.247 --> 00:05:55.285
I'm here to see
some relatives.


29
00:05:55.318 --> 00:05:56.722
Oh nice.

30
00:05:56.755 --> 00:05:59.159
Plus I think I could do
with a bit of peace and quiet.


31
00:05:59.193 --> 00:06:02.032
I can't handle
another late night.


32
00:06:05.372 --> 00:06:07.209
So what can I get you?

33
00:06:07.242 --> 00:06:10.750
Four coffees,
four strong coffees.


34
00:06:10.783 --> 00:06:13.187
I'll tell you what you need.

35
00:06:13.221 --> 00:06:15.526
You need a full
English breakfast.


36
00:06:15.559 --> 00:06:17.697
Trust me, a fry up is the
best thing I could do.


37
00:06:17.730 --> 00:06:21.937
She's right you know, you
can't beat a good old fry up.


38
00:06:21.971 --> 00:06:23.542
Okay we'll take four of them.

39
00:06:23.575 --> 00:06:24.943

40
00:06:24.977 --> 00:06:26.648

41
00:06:28.217 --> 00:06:29.286
Full works.

42
00:06:34.062 --> 00:06:35.833
- Pete?
- Yeah.


43
00:06:35.866 --> 00:06:37.870
Make it slow taste will you?

44
00:06:37.904 --> 00:06:39.072
I'm going on a break in five.

45
00:06:39.106 --> 00:06:41.076
You are one
cheeky mare ain't ya?


46
00:06:41.110 --> 00:06:42.212
Thank you.

47
00:06:42.245 --> 00:06:44.048
Yeah thank you and all.

48
00:06:44.082 --> 00:06:47.055
- No longer though yeah?
- Yeah.


49
00:06:48.459 --> 00:06:50.128
- Are there beans in this?
- I don't know...


50
00:06:50.161 --> 00:06:51.397
I don't like beans.

51
00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:53.936
- Me too.
- They make you fart.


52
00:06:57.275 --> 00:06:59.079
Did she give you her number?

53
00:06:59.112 --> 00:07:01.417
No it's the way
to Heatherfield.


54
00:07:01.451 --> 00:07:02.520
- Oh.
- Great.


55
00:07:03.922 --> 00:07:05.860
You know you don't have
to come with me right?


56
00:07:05.893 --> 00:07:07.061
I can meet you back
here in a few days.


57
00:07:07.095 --> 00:07:08.264
No we all came to
England to support you


58
00:07:08.297 --> 00:07:11.505
so we're all going
with you, right guys?


59
00:07:15.245 --> 00:07:16.948
Here we go guys.

60
00:07:16.982 --> 00:07:18.919
Big gasp.

61
00:07:18.952 --> 00:07:22.425
- If that's okay.
- It is thank you.


62
00:07:22.460 --> 00:07:24.263

63
00:07:24.296 --> 00:07:26.433
- Thank you.
- Okay.


64
00:07:33.347 --> 00:07:34.751
Hey Nicole.

65
00:07:34.784 --> 00:07:36.621
Are you at work?

66
00:07:36.655 --> 00:07:37.657
Okay.

67
00:07:38.458 --> 00:07:39.994
Yeah I'm shattered.

68
00:07:40.863 --> 00:07:43.000
You know I need the money.

69
00:07:44.637 --> 00:07:45.906
Oh yeah yeah yeah,

70
00:07:45.940 --> 00:07:48.444

be there this weekend.


71
00:07:48.478 --> 00:07:49.981
Yeah it'll be nice
to see you all.


72
00:07:50.014 --> 00:07:52.352
Jim I really think it's
gonna be great for you


73
00:07:52.385 --> 00:07:56.595
to finally meet them
especially after everything.


74
00:07:56.628 --> 00:08:00.435
Yeah man in all seriousness
I'm happy to be here with you.


75
00:08:00.469 --> 00:08:03.007
- Well cheers to that.
- Thanks.


76
00:08:04.644 --> 00:08:05.646
Okay.

77
00:08:07.717 --> 00:08:09.019
It falls apart.

78
00:08:13.227 --> 00:08:15.264
Excuse me what's this?

79
00:08:15.298 --> 00:08:16.635
Black pudding.

80
00:08:16.668 --> 00:08:17.903
What's in it?

81
00:08:19.039 --> 00:08:20.943
Pig's blood.

82
00:08:24.082 --> 00:08:26.153
Ah it's not bad.

83
00:08:26.186 --> 00:08:28.157
- I don't want it.
- Oh my god that's disgusting.


84
00:08:28.190 --> 00:08:29.994
Come here.

85
00:08:32.165 --> 00:08:33.735
That is gross.

86
00:08:33.769 --> 00:08:36.908
I will eat you also.

87
00:08:36.941 --> 00:08:39.112
Ooh what's that?

88
00:08:40.048 --> 00:08:41.383
Ooh what's that?

89
00:09:07.102 --> 00:09:09.339
Do they
have earthquakes here?


90
00:09:09.372 --> 00:09:10.943
Oh god run!

91
00:09:19.392 --> 00:09:21.931
Guys you need to move.

92
00:09:23.267 --> 00:09:27.442
What was that?

93
00:09:28.812 --> 00:09:30.949
Guy, guys you
need to move quick.


94
00:09:30.983 --> 00:09:32.887
Move away from the windows now.

95
00:09:32.920 --> 00:09:35.225
Just move, move, come on.

96
00:09:35.259 --> 00:09:36.594
Go go go go.

97
00:09:36.628 --> 00:09:38.465
Come on, come on.

98
00:09:38.498 --> 00:09:39.500
Come on.

99
00:09:40.401 --> 00:09:41.805
Come on, come on.

100
00:09:54.429 --> 00:09:57.235
Do your phones have news?

101
00:09:57.269 --> 00:09:59.607
- Is everyone okay?
- Yep.


102
00:10:10.329 --> 00:10:13.668
- Everyone...
- What's going on out there?


103
00:10:14.604 --> 00:10:16.808
- Did you see anything?
- I...


104
00:10:16.841 --> 00:10:18.578
What's outside?

105
00:10:18.612 --> 00:10:19.847
Is it terrorists or something?

106
00:10:19.881 --> 00:10:21.618
- I don't know.
- Shut up.


107
00:10:21.651 --> 00:10:22.953
What, I don't...

108
00:10:50.409 --> 00:10:52.446
Maybe she's shaken.

109
00:10:52.479 --> 00:10:54.784
We need some water.

110
00:10:54.817 --> 00:10:55.819
Okay.

111
00:10:59.694 --> 00:11:01.296
It's okay.

112
00:11:01.331 --> 00:11:03.100
- Quick.
- She's really shaken.


113
00:11:03.133 --> 00:11:04.302
Thank you.

114
00:11:04.337 --> 00:11:07.810
Alright take some
of this for us now.


115
00:11:07.843 --> 00:11:08.845
Just a sip.

116
00:11:12.886 --> 00:11:14.390
Well done.

117
00:11:14.423 --> 00:11:15.425
Hey.

118
00:11:16.594 --> 00:11:18.097
It's okay darling.

119
00:11:19.032 --> 00:11:20.902
It's okay sweetheart.

120
00:11:20.936 --> 00:11:22.873
Come on Grace.

121
00:11:25.912 --> 00:11:27.048
It's gonna be okay,

122
00:11:27.081 --> 00:11:30.490
it's fine, it's
fine, she's in shock.


123
00:11:30.555 --> 00:11:32.659
Can't get reception.

124
00:11:38.438 --> 00:11:42.011
Dude I can't see
anything, it's just people.


125
00:11:42.045 --> 00:11:43.482
I don't know what to do.

126
00:11:43.516 --> 00:11:44.383
It's gonna be
okay, it's gonna be okay.


127
00:11:44.417 --> 00:11:46.219
She's in shock, it's okay.

128
00:11:48.391 --> 00:11:52.534
Hey guys, guys quick
there's something on the news.


129
00:11:52.566 --> 00:11:55.405
I don't think
I should leave her.


130
00:11:55.439 --> 00:11:56.874
She'll be fine.

131
00:11:56.908 --> 00:11:58.177
The greater
London metropolitan area.


132
00:11:58.210 --> 00:12:00.550
While those services are
struggling to respond


133
00:12:00.582 --> 00:12:02.085
governmental authorities caution

134
00:12:02.118 --> 00:12:04.524
to avoid all areas of impact.

135
00:12:04.558 --> 00:12:07.996
Reports around the world
including the United States


136
00:12:08.030 --> 00:12:10.702
have similar claims of
people getting sick.


137
00:12:12.439 --> 00:12:13.240
Grace?

138
00:12:13.273 --> 00:12:14.275
Help!

139
00:12:14.309 --> 00:12:16.582
- You guys I need help.
- Benny.


140
00:12:17.749 --> 00:12:19.018
Out of the way,
out of the way.


141
00:12:20.121 --> 00:12:21.458
Turn her around.

142
00:12:22.893 --> 00:12:25.866
Turn her over, turn
her over, Grace, Grace.


143
00:12:25.899 --> 00:12:27.402
Jeez.

144
00:12:27.436 --> 00:12:29.707
Turn her on her side.

145
00:12:29.740 --> 00:12:32.412
- Whoa whoa.
- Such aggression.


146
00:12:35.752 --> 00:12:36.721
Give me the keys,
give me the keys!


147
00:12:36.754 --> 00:12:38.459
What are you doing?

148
00:12:38.492 --> 00:12:39.760
We can't
let anyone else in.


149
00:12:39.793 --> 00:12:41.764
Dude just let her
in she needs help.


150
00:12:41.797 --> 00:12:43.233
Whatever that is
it's making them sick.


151
00:12:43.267 --> 00:12:45.906
Well of
course they're sick.


152
00:12:45.939 --> 00:12:47.544
- They're not just sick.
- Oh god.


153
00:12:47.577 --> 00:12:51.416
They're not just
sick, give me the keys.


154
00:13:37.843 --> 00:13:38.911
She's dead.

155
00:13:40.014 --> 00:13:41.518
What are we gonna do now?

156
00:13:41.551 --> 00:13:43.020
We stay put.

157
00:13:43.053 --> 00:13:45.124
Whatever happened,
it happened outside.


158
00:13:45.157 --> 00:13:48.831
Then why did she
bite it in here?


159
00:13:48.865 --> 00:13:51.202
No one else gets in.

160
00:14:13.080 --> 00:14:15.885
(panting heavily

161
00:15:12.600 --> 00:15:13.968
Look my car's near by.

162
00:15:14.001 --> 00:15:15.404
We can get you some help
okay, we'll go get some help.


163
00:15:15.437 --> 00:15:17.107
I need some water.

164
00:15:19.747 --> 00:15:20.950
- He's got it.
- Got what?


165
00:15:20.982 --> 00:15:21.918
- What?
- He's got it.


166
00:15:21.952 --> 00:15:22.620
- Got what?
- What?


167
00:15:22.653 --> 00:15:23.922
Pete.

168
00:15:28.096 --> 00:15:28.899
What're you doing?

169
00:15:28.932 --> 00:15:29.934
Stay back.

170
00:15:30.803 --> 00:15:31.638
Please.

171
00:15:31.671 --> 00:15:33.675
You need to leave now.

172
00:15:35.244 --> 00:15:37.984
Just leave.

173
00:15:38.016 --> 00:15:39.988
Pete!

174
00:15:40.020 --> 00:15:42.927
Christ, okay let's
go, let's go, everybody.


175
00:15:42.960 --> 00:15:44.195
Pete.

176
00:15:46.701 --> 00:15:48.036
Come on.

177
00:16:24.911 --> 00:16:25.913
Which way?

178
00:16:28.017 --> 00:16:29.185
Where is it?

179
00:16:29.218 --> 00:16:31.090
I'm just thinking
about the best way okay.


180
00:16:31.155 --> 00:16:33.527
- This way, okay.
- Are you sure?


181
00:16:33.561 --> 00:16:34.797
- I think so.
- You think?


182
00:16:34.831 --> 00:16:36.432
- You think?
- Yes.


183
00:16:49.158 --> 00:16:50.996
I'm sorry I'm sorry.

184
00:16:52.532 --> 00:16:54.301
Hey, hey.

185
00:16:57.877 --> 00:16:59.079
Go go go.

186
00:17:50.413 --> 00:17:54.222
- Which one's yours?
- The one at the back.


187
00:18:21.510 --> 00:18:25.184
Go go.

188
00:18:52.105 --> 00:18:53.474
She has a baby.

189
00:18:59.486 --> 00:19:00.956
We gotta save it.

190
00:19:01.824 --> 00:19:04.329
It doesn't even look alive.

191
00:19:13.013 --> 00:19:14.382
Is it infected?

192
00:19:15.384 --> 00:19:16.988
Is it?

193
00:19:17.021 --> 00:19:19.459
I think it moved.

194
00:19:19.492 --> 00:19:21.129
We need to leave.

195
00:19:23.400 --> 00:19:26.139
There's no way we're
leaving her with that baby.


196
00:19:26.173 --> 00:19:27.675
She's right.

197
00:19:27.709 --> 00:19:30.214
We can't leave without it.

198
00:19:35.993 --> 00:19:36.995
Go.

199
00:19:38.230 --> 00:19:40.735
Go!

200
00:20:09.192 --> 00:20:10.862
Astrophysicists are reporting

201
00:20:10.896 --> 00:20:14.169
that intense electro
magnetic storms on the sun


202
00:20:14.202 --> 00:20:16.673
have triggered deep fissures
and enormous eruptions


203
00:20:16.706 --> 00:20:20.614
violently blasting
solar matter into space.


204
00:20:20.648 --> 00:20:22.251
Thousands of times more powerful

205
00:20:22.285 --> 00:20:25.324
than has ever been detected.

206
00:20:25.357 --> 00:20:28.197
The solar debris has pierced
the Earth's magnetic field


207
00:20:28.230 --> 00:20:32.705
and ozone layer and caused
widespread destruction.


208
00:20:32.738 --> 00:20:35.344
Human exposure to the vast
amounts of solar radiation


209
00:20:35.377 --> 00:20:39.385
has resulted in alarming
DNA cellular mutations.


210
00:20:40.889 --> 00:20:42.725
Response by the police and
military around the world


211
00:20:42.758 --> 00:20:45.698
have been dissipating as the
effects of the radioactivity


212
00:20:45.731 --> 00:20:50.241
have been spreading beyond
any conceivable rate.


213
00:20:50.274 --> 00:20:53.581
It's imperative to avoid
all human interaction


214
00:20:53.615 --> 00:20:56.887
including physical contact
with friends or family members


215
00:20:56.921 --> 00:20:59.726
who might of been contaminated.

216
00:20:59.759 --> 00:21:03.133
Symptoms include
dark bloodshot eyes,


217
00:21:03.167 --> 00:21:07.208
protruding veins, unusually
aggressive behavior


218
00:21:07.241 --> 00:21:09.547
and an insatiable
craving to attack


219
00:21:09.580 --> 00:21:11.883
and feed on other people.

220
00:21:19.132 --> 00:21:21.102
I don't have a spare.

221
00:21:29.385 --> 00:21:31.457
Look clearly nobody wants to
talk about what's happening.


222
00:21:31.490 --> 00:21:33.227
Yeah I don't want
to talk about it.


223
00:21:33.260 --> 00:21:35.064
We all saw what happened.

224
00:21:37.134 --> 00:21:40.642
Gabe!

225
00:21:40.675 --> 00:21:43.313
Get out, get out, get out!

226
00:21:49.859 --> 00:21:53.000
Hey, hey.

227
00:22:29.573 --> 00:22:33.748
- So what are we gonna do now?
- We keep going, on foot.


228
00:22:35.518 --> 00:22:36.986
But where?

229
00:22:37.021 --> 00:22:38.825
Okay well let's just start
by getting out of London.


230
00:22:38.890 --> 00:22:40.994
Okay let's go to the airport.

231
00:22:41.029 --> 00:22:43.400
I don't know, it could
be full of infected people.


232
00:22:43.433 --> 00:22:46.239
- Well where are we gonna go?
- I don't know.


233
00:22:46.272 --> 00:22:48.143
Dude she's right okay.

234
00:22:48.176 --> 00:22:49.345
Let's just get out of the city.

235
00:22:49.379 --> 00:22:53.688
We can figure out what
we're doing after that.


236
00:22:53.721 --> 00:22:57.395
Do you think we'll
ever make it back home?


237
00:22:59.899 --> 00:23:03.440
What do you think
is going on back home?


238
00:23:03.474 --> 00:23:04.576
Same thing.

239
00:23:06.614 --> 00:23:07.616
What?

240
00:23:08.618 --> 00:23:11.222
It's on the news,
we were hit too.


241
00:23:18.136 --> 00:23:20.675
She didn't need
to know about it.


242
00:24:06.500 --> 00:24:08.103
Guys come on.

243
00:24:08.136 --> 00:24:11.777
- Benny come on.
- Not my running shoes.


244
00:25:09.526 --> 00:25:11.497
Come on now, come on.

245
00:25:25.491 --> 00:25:27.027
- Guys?
- Guys?


246
00:26:36.567 --> 00:26:40.741
We gotta find them.

247
00:26:42.278 --> 00:26:43.747
Where are they?

248
00:26:43.781 --> 00:26:45.484
God damn it.

249
00:26:45.518 --> 00:26:47.655
We blew it guys.

250
00:26:47.689 --> 00:26:48.958
No we didn't.

251
00:26:48.991 --> 00:26:50.227
Alright guys.

252
00:26:50.261 --> 00:26:51.463
Come this way okay, okay?

253
00:27:01.717 --> 00:27:02.719
Jim.

254
00:27:03.621 --> 00:27:05.358
I'm glad you're okay.

255
00:27:31.677 --> 00:27:33.681
Guys guys guys
we gotta go go go.


256
00:27:33.714 --> 00:27:35.216
Come on, come on, come on.

257
00:27:37.956 --> 00:27:39.359
Go go go.

258
00:27:41.496 --> 00:27:43.232
Oh god, go go go, go.

259
00:27:45.838 --> 00:27:46.840
- No.
- Gabe!


260
00:27:49.813 --> 00:27:51.383
- Let go.
- Gabe!


261
00:27:51.416 --> 00:27:54.188
Get him out, get him out.

262
00:28:03.072 --> 00:28:04.274
Are you okay?

263
00:28:05.276 --> 00:28:06.380
Are you okay?

264
00:28:07.582 --> 00:28:08.851
I'm okay.

265
00:28:54.274 --> 00:28:55.945
We gotta go back in.

266
00:28:57.114 --> 00:28:58.585
I'm not
going back in there.


267
00:28:58.617 --> 00:29:00.353
Well you really
want to stay on this roof?


268
00:29:09.104 --> 00:29:11.544
Hey guys, this is good.

269
00:29:11.577 --> 00:29:13.279
We gotta go back in.

270
00:29:50.854 --> 00:29:53.092
They're still out there.

271
00:30:23.854 --> 00:30:26.091
It's gonna get dark soon.

272
00:30:27.227 --> 00:30:29.799
We should probably
stay the night.


273
00:32:07.629 --> 00:32:08.631
You okay?

274
00:32:10.635 --> 00:32:11.637
Yeah.

275
00:32:12.973 --> 00:32:13.975
Are you?

276
00:32:14.977 --> 00:32:15.979
I'm okay.

277
00:32:19.753 --> 00:32:22.290
You trying to contact someone?

278
00:32:22.323 --> 00:32:24.160
I have done.

279
00:32:24.194 --> 00:32:26.634
My mom, my dad and my sister.

280
00:32:27.969 --> 00:32:30.842
I'm really worried
about my sister.


281
00:32:36.385 --> 00:32:40.561
Well if she's anything like
you I'm sure she'll be fine.


282
00:32:41.964 --> 00:32:43.533
Whereabouts is she?

283
00:32:44.770 --> 00:32:47.608
She works in the
hospital near by.


284
00:32:52.786 --> 00:32:57.796
What about you, have you
tried to contact anyone?


285
00:32:57.829 --> 00:32:58.831
- No.
- No?


286
00:33:06.311 --> 00:33:09.384
My sister died
about a month ago.


287
00:33:09.417 --> 00:33:10.419
Sorry.

288
00:33:12.993 --> 00:33:14.495
Our parents died
when we were young


289
00:33:14.528 --> 00:33:17.367
so it was always
just us you know?


290
00:33:19.505 --> 00:33:21.542
And then about a year ago

291
00:33:22.912 --> 00:33:26.019
she finds these guys
in Heatherfield.


292
00:33:27.689 --> 00:33:31.697
And she'd always wanted
to come over and see it.


293
00:33:33.198 --> 00:33:34.703
We'll get there.

294
00:33:35.738 --> 00:33:36.740
I promise.

295
00:33:41.348 --> 00:33:44.220
You said your sister
was in the hospital right?


296
00:33:44.254 --> 00:33:45.256
Yeah.

297
00:33:47.027 --> 00:33:49.364
Then we'll go there first.

298
00:33:50.433 --> 00:33:51.435
Thank you.

299
00:33:54.041 --> 00:33:55.043
Thank you.

300
00:34:48.616 --> 00:34:51.689
Run run.

301
00:35:04.682 --> 00:35:06.285
Move.

302
00:36:04.468 --> 00:36:05.470
Come on.

303
00:36:19.098 --> 00:36:20.500
Gabe it's okay.

304
00:36:20.533 --> 00:36:22.004
Okay Gabe?

305
00:36:41.342 --> 00:36:42.844
But we gotta go.

306
00:37:11.903 --> 00:37:13.474
Guys fire escape.

307
00:37:17.247 --> 00:37:21.722
Come on, you're
okay, come on, come on.


308
00:37:21.755 --> 00:37:22.757
Come on.

309
00:37:33.813 --> 00:37:34.815
Gabe.

310
00:37:41.596 --> 00:37:43.266
Gabe, come on buddy.

311
00:37:45.103 --> 00:37:46.739
We gotta go.

312
00:37:46.772 --> 00:37:50.146
Come on you're okay, you're
okay, come on, you got it buddy.


313
00:37:50.180 --> 00:37:54.354
You got it, you got it, you
got it, come on, come on.


314
00:37:55.491 --> 00:37:56.759
Gabe come on.

315
00:37:56.792 --> 00:37:59.731
Gabe, Gabe, Gabe
you've got this.


316
00:38:00.601 --> 00:38:01.937
Whoa jeez, Gabe.

317
00:38:03.005 --> 00:38:05.945
Gabe, Gabe, Gabe
listen, listen to me.


318
00:38:05.978 --> 00:38:06.980
Gabe, guys!

319
00:38:13.759 --> 00:38:15.263
Get back, Gabe, Gabe.

320
00:38:18.035 --> 00:38:19.037
Gabe?

321
00:38:22.043 --> 00:38:23.614
Gabe?

322
00:38:23.647 --> 00:38:24.682
Gabe wake up.

323
00:38:25.618 --> 00:38:26.620
Gabe!

324
00:38:29.391 --> 00:38:32.864
I'm sorry.

325
00:38:32.897 --> 00:38:36.973
I am so sorry.

326
00:39:16.385 --> 00:39:17.555
I don't like it.

327
00:39:17.588 --> 00:39:18.989
It's a little quiet
don't you think?


328
00:39:19.024 --> 00:39:20.661
Where is everyone?

329
00:39:20.694 --> 00:39:21.929
Inside maybe?

330
00:39:22.897 --> 00:39:24.569
Guys we shouldn't go in there.

331
00:39:24.602 --> 00:39:26.003
I don't know.

332
00:39:26.038 --> 00:39:27.374
Maybe there are people
trapped that need our help.


333
00:39:27.407 --> 00:39:30.848
Yeah or maybe it's
crawling with infected.


334
00:39:30.880 --> 00:39:33.352
Look I don't think it's
worth taking the chance.


335
00:39:33.386 --> 00:39:34.555
It's not safe.

336
00:39:35.923 --> 00:39:38.996
You guys just wait here
yeah, I'm gonna go by myself.


337
00:39:39.030 --> 00:39:41.335
Whoa whoa whoa that is crazy.

338
00:39:41.368 --> 00:39:44.241
No come on Benny's
right, we'll go with you.


339
00:39:44.274 --> 00:39:46.446
Wait that's not what I meant.

340
00:39:46.479 --> 00:39:47.380
Come on.

341
00:39:47.414 --> 00:39:49.951
Babes I'm not going in there.

342
00:41:35.831 --> 00:41:40.373
Benny are you alright?

343
00:41:40.406 --> 00:41:41.876
Oh my god, please leave it.

344
00:41:41.909 --> 00:41:43.012
It's okay, it's okay.

345
00:41:43.045 --> 00:41:45.484
Get it around there.

346
00:41:45.517 --> 00:41:48.556
It's gonna be okay,
it's gonna be okay.


347
00:41:48.590 --> 00:41:50.560
We're gonna get help.

348
00:41:50.594 --> 00:41:51.696
We can get help.

349
00:41:51.729 --> 00:41:53.332
We're getting help.

350
00:41:53.365 --> 00:41:55.336
You're okay.

351
00:41:55.369 --> 00:41:58.008
Don't worry you're fine, really.

352
00:42:58.295 --> 00:42:59.598
Did I propose?

353
00:43:01.269 --> 00:43:03.606
I honestly can't remember.

354
00:43:03.640 --> 00:43:06.245
You were going to propose?

355
00:43:06.279 --> 00:43:08.650
On the top of the London Eye

356
00:43:08.683 --> 00:43:11.087
overlooking the whole city.

357
00:43:11.121 --> 00:43:14.093
It was gonna be really romantic.

358
00:43:26.953 --> 00:43:28.756
Will you marry me?

359
00:43:28.790 --> 00:43:30.760
Of course I will.

360
00:43:37.608 --> 00:43:38.676
It's perfect.

361
00:43:46.124 --> 00:43:47.961
You gonna put it on?

362
00:43:49.965 --> 00:43:51.936
I love it.

363
00:43:51.969 --> 00:43:54.475
Good I got a hell of a deal.

364
00:43:54.508 --> 00:43:56.646
- You did?
- Yeah.


365
00:43:56.679 --> 00:43:58.483
- Nice work.
- Thanks.


366
00:44:03.058 --> 00:44:04.461
She's not here.

367
00:44:06.332 --> 00:44:08.670
We're gonna find her okay?

368
00:44:10.407 --> 00:44:11.409
Yeah.

369
00:44:12.344 --> 00:44:13.346
Yeah.

370
00:44:14.481 --> 00:44:16.017
We will find her.

371
00:44:17.921 --> 00:44:20.192
- Yeah I know.
- 14th floor.


372
00:44:22.296 --> 00:44:23.466
Doors opening.

373
00:45:07.687 --> 00:45:09.858
How are you feeling?

374
00:45:09.892 --> 00:45:11.061
Don't worry.

375
00:45:26.560 --> 00:45:27.394
Let's go, let's go.

376
00:45:27.427 --> 00:45:29.865
You shouldn't be here.

377
00:45:29.898 --> 00:45:32.437
The hospital was
evacuated hours ago.


378
00:45:32.472 --> 00:45:33.706
You should leave.

379
00:45:33.739 --> 00:45:35.375
There are still infected
people in this building.


380
00:45:35.410 --> 00:45:36.612
It's not safe.

381
00:45:36.645 --> 00:45:38.048
Look my sister Nicole
Davis, she works here...


382
00:45:38.081 --> 00:45:40.252
No I'm sorry, I'm
sorry, I don't know her.


383
00:45:40.285 --> 00:45:44.026
Look some people got
infected, some got killed.


384
00:45:44.060 --> 00:45:45.730
Others got out in time.

385
00:45:45.763 --> 00:45:46.932
You need to leave.

386
00:45:46.966 --> 00:45:48.402
Okay look my friend
was bitten okay.


387
00:45:48.436 --> 00:45:49.572
You have to help him.

388
00:45:49.606 --> 00:45:51.476
I'm sorry I can't,
it's too late.


389
00:45:51.510 --> 00:45:53.980
You don't understand do you?

390
00:45:54.013 --> 00:45:57.086
We're all going to die, you, me.

391
00:45:57.119 --> 00:45:58.121
I'm sorry.

392
00:45:59.190 --> 00:46:00.461
We're all dead.

393
00:46:15.355 --> 00:46:16.959
Benny no.

394
00:47:41.563 --> 00:47:42.665
Benny.

395
00:47:52.618 --> 00:47:53.620
Benny?

396
00:47:54.555 --> 00:47:55.557
Breathe.

397
00:47:57.025 --> 00:47:58.730
Benny, breathe honey.

398
00:48:02.772 --> 00:48:03.774
Breathe.

399
00:48:05.811 --> 00:48:08.449
You're okay.

400
00:48:08.482 --> 00:48:09.484
God.

401
00:48:13.794 --> 00:48:15.764
- Okay, come with us.
- I can't.


402
00:48:15.798 --> 00:48:17.332
You're safer than
with us than you are...


403
00:48:17.366 --> 00:48:21.274
I can't leave, I still got
one more patient to see to.


404
00:48:21.307 --> 00:48:24.649
Besides none of us
are going to survive.


405
00:48:29.156 --> 00:48:30.661
You need to leave.

406
00:48:33.264 --> 00:48:35.368
You can't stay here.

407
00:48:35.402 --> 00:48:37.272
I have to stay.

408
00:48:47.059 --> 00:48:49.263
Baby, Daddy's here darling.

409
00:48:50.734 --> 00:48:55.075
It's okay, it's okay,
everything's going to be okay.


410
00:48:55.108 --> 00:48:57.112
I love you my love.

411
00:48:57.145 --> 00:49:01.320
I love you so much, it's
okay baby.


412
00:49:08.368 --> 00:49:09.872
Just go, please.

413
00:49:12.142 --> 00:49:13.947
Before it's too late.

414
00:49:14.782 --> 00:49:16.117
Benny, please.

415
00:49:17.721 --> 00:49:19.156
Just stay back.

416
00:49:31.048 --> 00:49:32.885
You have to leave now.

417
00:49:38.161 --> 00:49:41.167
- You don't have to do this.
- Just go.


418
00:49:41.200 --> 00:49:44.642
You don't have to do
this, don't have to do this.


419
00:49:44.675 --> 00:49:45.476
- Go.
- You don't!


420
00:49:45.509 --> 00:49:46.578
- No.
- Benny!


421
00:50:14.100 --> 00:50:15.671
Where's Benny?

422
00:50:15.704 --> 00:50:18.174
- What's wrong?
- Where's Benny?


423
00:50:18.207 --> 00:50:20.546
- Say it.
- He wants to stay.


424
00:50:30.533 --> 00:50:32.202
Keep her safe Jim.

425
00:50:35.375 --> 00:50:38.214
Go, go.

426
00:50:39.383 --> 00:50:40.385
Go!

427
00:51:00.059 --> 00:51:01.595
We have to go.

428
00:51:06.906 --> 00:51:07.908
You're okay.

429
00:52:09.965 --> 00:52:12.303
Can we just take a moment?

430
00:52:16.544 --> 00:52:19.985
Okay but we need
to keep going.


431
00:52:20.019 --> 00:52:22.023
We're out
of the city okay.


432
00:52:24.661 --> 00:52:26.331
Did you hear that?

433
00:52:41.394 --> 00:52:43.165
We need to go okay?

434
00:52:46.071 --> 00:52:48.008
Katie, come on.

435
00:53:56.311 --> 00:53:57.313
Katie!

436
00:53:58.281 --> 00:53:59.283
Katie!

437
00:54:49.451 --> 00:54:50.687
Katie, Katie.

438
00:56:08.041 --> 00:56:09.377
She's gone okay.

439
00:56:13.385 --> 00:56:14.387
I'm sorry.

440
00:57:17.780 --> 00:57:18.782
Nicole.

441
00:57:25.997 --> 00:57:30.338
I thought you were...

442
00:57:30.372 --> 00:57:32.442
And Mom and Dad are they inside?

443
00:57:32.477 --> 00:57:33.479
No.

444
00:57:35.282 --> 00:57:36.919
Don't go in.

445
00:57:38.522 --> 00:57:39.524
No.

446
00:57:40.626 --> 00:57:41.628
I'm sorry.

447
00:57:43.465 --> 00:57:45.469
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

448
00:57:45.503 --> 00:57:47.104
We can't go inside.

449
00:57:49.778 --> 00:57:50.947
I'm sorry.

450
00:58:09.651 --> 00:58:10.720
This is

451
00:58:10.753 --> 00:58:13.224
the emergency
broadcasting service.


452
00:58:13.257 --> 00:58:16.197
Communications have been
severely interrupted.


453
00:58:16.230 --> 00:58:17.667
The number of casualties

454
00:58:17.700 --> 00:58:20.873
and the extent of the
damage are not yet known.


455
00:58:20.906 --> 00:58:23.646
If you live in an area
where radiation has occurred


456
00:58:23.679 --> 00:58:26.485
stay in your shelter
until you are told


457
00:58:26.518 --> 00:58:27.987
it is safe to come out.

458
00:58:28.021 --> 00:58:30.157
When the immediate
danger has passed


459
00:58:30.191 --> 00:58:34.033
the sirens' all clear
message will be given.


460
00:58:34.066 --> 00:58:36.203
You shall be on the air...

461
00:58:46.558 --> 00:58:47.560
Hello?

462
00:58:53.539 --> 00:58:54.541
Hello?

463
00:58:58.449 --> 00:58:59.451
Owen?

464
00:59:08.434 --> 00:59:09.436
Owen?

465
00:59:13.912 --> 00:59:15.549
Jane?

466
00:59:22.262 --> 00:59:23.732
So you made it.

467
00:59:37.660 --> 00:59:40.733
I'm surprised you got through

468
00:59:40.766 --> 00:59:43.906
with everything
that's been going on.


469
00:59:52.590 --> 00:59:54.326
It's a two way radio.

470
00:59:56.096 --> 00:59:57.633
Can't pick up much.

471
00:59:58.602 --> 01:00:00.405
A few cries for help.

472
01:00:02.643 --> 01:00:03.946
You never know.

473
01:00:10.793 --> 01:00:15.336
I suppose you want a cup
of tea or something huh?


474
01:00:15.368 --> 01:00:17.707
I'll knock you something up.

475
01:00:22.215 --> 01:00:23.485
Where's Jane?

476
01:00:31.334 --> 01:00:33.137
She didn't make it.

477
01:01:14.721 --> 01:01:18.027
Thank you for
getting my sister home.


478
01:01:22.035 --> 01:01:24.540
She did her share, trust me.

479
01:01:26.444 --> 01:01:28.548
Yeah she's a tough one.

480
01:01:58.074 --> 01:01:59.276
It won't work.

481
01:02:03.618 --> 01:02:04.854
Eddie.

482
01:02:08.563 --> 01:02:10.866
Eddie don't make me do this.

483
01:02:10.899 --> 01:02:12.001
Eddie.

484
01:03:23.310 --> 01:03:25.014
We need to talk.

485
01:03:38.808 --> 01:03:42.983
She got infected.

486
01:03:43.017 --> 01:03:44.655
She became violent.

487
01:03:48.995 --> 01:03:50.331
She attacked me.

488
01:03:53.404 --> 01:03:57.178
I just, I couldn't bring
myself to, you know.


489
01:04:03.858 --> 01:04:06.430
You should've said something.

490
01:04:08.233 --> 01:04:09.402
We just met.

491
01:04:10.939 --> 01:04:13.210
Didn't seem the right time.

492
01:04:16.618 --> 01:04:19.658
So what happens when that
thing decides to attack us?


493
01:04:19.691 --> 01:04:21.695
That thing is my wife.

494
01:04:30.277 --> 01:04:32.883
That's not your wife anymore.

495
01:04:34.052 --> 01:04:36.692
Too dangerous
to keep her here.


496
01:04:39.129 --> 01:04:41.568
I'm not gonna kill my wife.

497
01:04:50.986 --> 01:04:54.761
You're so young, so
naive, so quick to judge.


498
01:05:01.875 --> 01:05:05.449
Have you even thought
about a possible cure?


499
01:05:06.819 --> 01:05:09.155
No, you're too busy killing.

500
01:05:13.330 --> 01:05:16.471
You're murdering these people.

501
01:05:16.504 --> 01:05:19.275
Owen you've
killed, we saw you.


502
01:05:21.615 --> 01:05:23.116
In self defense.

503
01:05:27.024 --> 01:05:30.364
Eddie was my neighbor
for over 20 years.


504
01:05:32.837 --> 01:05:34.305
He's been wandering
around outside


505
01:05:34.339 --> 01:05:36.778
the cottage since this begun.

506
01:05:37.947 --> 01:05:41.353
I killed him when he
became a threat to us.


507
01:05:45.127 --> 01:05:46.129
You.

508
01:05:48.468 --> 01:05:51.039
You're family, don't forget it.

509
01:05:53.846 --> 01:05:55.783
I look after my family.

510
01:06:01.293 --> 01:06:03.230
My wife is not a threat.

511
01:08:11.587 --> 01:08:13.257
We've got company.

512
01:08:14.293 --> 01:08:16.597
Stay away from the windows.

513
01:08:27.854 --> 01:08:29.388
Nicole!

514
01:09:52.122 --> 01:09:54.894
Get ready,
they're breaking in.


515
01:09:59.736 --> 01:10:02.842
Take the radio and
leave out the back.


516
01:10:02.877 --> 01:10:04.914
They're everywhere.

517
01:10:04.947 --> 01:10:06.583
Not for long.

518
01:10:06.617 --> 01:10:08.854
I'll lure them at the front.

519
01:10:08.889 --> 01:10:10.792
No, we stay together.

520
01:10:30.298 --> 01:10:32.470
I can feel it inside me.

521
01:10:44.460 --> 01:10:45.929
You're family, go.

522
01:10:54.646 --> 01:10:55.916
Owen no.

523
01:10:55.949 --> 01:10:58.622
Go!

524
01:11:03.932 --> 01:11:05.368
Jim come on.

525
01:13:07.579 --> 01:13:08.414
Hello?

526
01:13:28.320 --> 01:13:31.092
I can't believe
this happening.


527
01:13:32.563 --> 01:13:33.565
I know.

528
01:13:36.970 --> 01:13:41.146
The others they, they
came down for me and now...


529
01:13:42.081 --> 01:13:44.118
This is not your fault.

530
01:13:44.152 --> 01:13:47.493
You can't blame
yourself Jim, you can't.


531
01:13:49.027 --> 01:13:52.368
I wonder if there's
somewhere safe.


532
01:13:52.401 --> 01:13:55.274
Jim are we gonna
be safe in here?


533
01:13:57.111 --> 01:14:00.284
If you get that
thing working maybe.


534
01:14:01.487 --> 01:14:03.892
Owen said we gotta be
as high as possible.


535
01:14:03.925 --> 01:14:06.464
Yeah well the church tower.

536
01:14:06.497 --> 01:14:08.333
Yeah, okay let's go.

537
01:14:26.704 --> 01:14:27.773
Come on.

538
01:14:31.647 --> 01:14:33.751
Damn it we need a key.

539
01:14:33.785 --> 01:14:36.356
Well it must be
here somewhere.


540
01:14:52.355 --> 01:14:54.325
Guys I've got a key.

541
01:15:00.404 --> 01:15:01.907
Here try that one.

542
01:15:06.851 --> 01:15:08.454
Just go.

543
01:15:08.488 --> 01:15:09.490
Go!

544
01:15:17.739 --> 01:15:18.741
Go!

545
01:15:34.172 --> 01:15:35.007
Jim?

546
01:15:39.415 --> 01:15:40.417
Jim!

547
01:15:41.286 --> 01:15:42.421
Go!

548
01:16:07.438 --> 01:16:08.440
Susan.

549
01:16:14.586 --> 01:16:16.222
Keep going.

550
01:16:28.180 --> 01:16:29.415
Jim!

551
01:16:42.309 --> 01:16:45.315
No wait for him, wait no no.

552
01:16:45.347 --> 01:16:46.917
Jim!

553
01:16:46.951 --> 01:16:49.756
No he's coming, no he's coming.

554
01:16:49.790 --> 01:16:51.192
Listen for him.

555
01:17:37.986 --> 01:17:39.221
Susan!

556
01:17:55.688 --> 01:17:56.690
Susan!

557
01:17:59.195 --> 01:18:01.533
Susan it's me open the door.

558
01:18:17.732 --> 01:18:21.907
That door won't hold.

559
01:18:49.763 --> 01:18:51.265
What do we do now?

560
01:18:56.544 --> 01:18:57.779
Are you okay?

561
01:19:00.150 --> 01:19:01.588
Jim are you okay?

562
01:19:06.930 --> 01:19:08.667
Have you been bitten?

563
01:19:10.137 --> 01:19:11.907
Have you been bitten?

564
01:19:12.909 --> 01:19:13.911
No.

565
01:19:17.453 --> 01:19:18.754
Guys.

566
01:20:58.887 --> 01:21:02.830
This is Delta

567
01:21:02.862 --> 01:21:07.337
We have eyes on three civilians
on top of a church tower.


568
01:21:07.371 --> 01:21:11.547
Hard to determine if they're
contaminated or survivors.


569
01:21:12.683 --> 01:21:15.153
Targets are locked,
awaiting orders.


570
01:21:15.186 --> 01:21:17.224
Extract or shoot to kill.

571
01:21:32.021 --> 01:21:37.021
