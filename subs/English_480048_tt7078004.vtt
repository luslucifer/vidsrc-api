1
00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:17.375
We're losing altitude quickly. We'll crash.

2
00:00:50.109 --> 00:00:52.974
Are you okay? 
-I'm okay.

3
00:00:54.344 --> 00:00:56.011
Get you to the trees?

4
00:00:59.265 --> 00:01:05.230
GERMANY 1944

5
00:01:17.199 --> 00:01:18.599
Al.

6
00:01:20.745 --> 00:01:22.289
Friend.

7
00:01:22.414 --> 00:01:24.833
Did you come down hard? No, Captain.

8
00:01:24.958 --> 00:01:27.294
It was a beautiful landing. 
That should see you.

9
00:01:27.419 --> 00:01:31.757
I was hit by shrapnel. 
-Let me have a look.

10
00:01:31.882 --> 00:01:34.320
I only suffered a hard blow.

11
00:01:36.344 --> 00:01:37.744
How I'm ready?

12
00:01:38.513 --> 00:01:40.473
It's just a scratch. Come on.

13
00:01:40.599 --> 00:01:42.184
We you again tinker.

14
00:01:50.191 --> 00:01:51.592
Style.

15
00:01:54.863 --> 00:01:56.490
I hit hard, huh?

16
00:02:02.329 --> 00:02:03.914
I want to go home.

17
00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:07.101
I want to go home. 
-We will take you home.

18
00:02:08.918 --> 00:02:10.795
I want to go home. 
-Quiet.

19
00:02:10.921 --> 00:02:12.714
Everything will be fine.

20
00:02:12.839 --> 00:02:16.009
I want to go home. 
-It will be all right.

21
00:02:16.134 --> 00:02:18.946
I'll help you. 
I'll see that you can go home.

22
00:02:21.306 --> 00:02:22.706
Everything will be fine.

23
00:02:32.192 --> 00:02:35.736
And now? 
-We have to go.

24
00:02:36.695 --> 00:02:38.405
We can not ... 
-Come him.

25
00:02:41.033 --> 00:02:42.994
We have to go. Hurry up.

26
00:03:01.262 --> 00:03:04.391
Stay seated. I go exploring.

27
00:03:31.125 --> 00:03:32.526
Quiet.

28
00:03:42.387 --> 00:03:44.680
This is one of those pilots.

29
00:03:54.982 --> 00:03:56.609
My mother ...

30
00:04:01.155 --> 00:04:02.824
and my sister.

31
00:04:06.411 --> 00:04:09.205
You.

32
00:04:22.385 --> 00:04:24.387
Hello, American.

33
00:04:24.513 --> 00:04:26.515
For you the war is over.

34
00:05:06.846 --> 00:05:08.597
Magnificent.

35
00:05:10.349 --> 00:05:11.749
For you.

36
00:05:13.019 --> 00:05:14.646
What is it called?

37
00:05:15.647 --> 00:05:17.709
What do you think of '
Across the Sky'?

38
00:05:19.775 --> 00:05:21.174
Not bad.

39
00:05:26.866 --> 00:05:29.368
'A Long Way across the Sky'.

40
00:05:32.663 --> 00:05:34.540
Play it again.

41
00:05:55.561 --> 00:05:59.186
Do not worry. We
bring you guys back home.

42
00:06:04.404 --> 00:06:05.966
To your new home.

43
00:06:08.282 --> 00:06:10.366
To get off.

44
00:06:15.414 --> 00:06:16.814
Fast.

45
00:06:20.211 --> 00:06:21.611
Thank you.

46
00:06:36.227 --> 00:06:39.771
You are now prisoners of the German Reich.

47
00:06:43.274 --> 00:06:46.695
Despite your attempts to destroy our country ...

48
00:06:48.531 --> 00:06:52.868
you will be treated very decently ...

49
00:06:52.993 --> 00:06:56.831
according to the Geneva Convention.

50
00:06:58.456 --> 00:07:03.211
If you can abide by the
rules, we also, to the rules.

51
00:07:04.839 --> 00:07:07.299
But if you do not ...

52
00:07:07.425 --> 00:07:10.428
will you stay a lot more unpleasant.

53
00:07:13.596 --> 00:07:18.060
Prisoners go to your barracks. Hurry up.

54
00:07:23.148 --> 00:07:24.549
Stop.

55
00:07:40.207 --> 00:07:42.168
You want to say something?

56
00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:02.103
You must salute.

57
00:08:02.228 --> 00:08:06.942
Only when the last few
days have been promoted several times.

58
00:08:07.067 --> 00:08:10.446
You must salute 
-No.

59
00:08:10.571 --> 00:08:12.383
I am higher in rank than you.

60
00:08:19.412 --> 00:08:24.084
I'm not going to greet a
sergeant major, but George tries every day.

61
00:08:24.209 --> 00:08:26.337
Welcome to the madhouse. 
I'm Larry Packer.

62
00:08:26.462 --> 00:08:30.132
Is one of you accidentally higher
in rank than a lieutenant colonel?

63
00:08:30.257 --> 00:08:31.342
Nee, sir.

64
00:08:31.467 --> 00:08:34.260
I first lieutenant and
second lieutenant is my copilot.

65
00:08:34.385 --> 00:08:38.056
I'm still here, the top American officer.

66
00:08:38.181 --> 00:08:42.686
The sleeves still bring down a colonel. 
-Second Lieutenant Vincent Petrolini.

67
00:08:42.811 --> 00:08:44.980
Board mechanic. 
-Vinny, from New York.

68
00:08:45.105 --> 00:08:46.816
Clair Cline, Minnesota.

69
00:08:46.941 --> 00:08:49.025
So, what a beautiful name.

70
00:08:49.150 --> 00:08:52.278
Call him but Cline. Reed Whitaker, Albuquerque.

71
00:08:52.403 --> 00:08:54.656
I'm so rude. Sit down.

72
00:08:54.781 --> 00:08:56.450
Show me your leg see.

73
00:08:57.618 --> 00:08:58.994
McReady. 
-Yes, sir?

74
00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:01.162
Give your crutch.

75
00:09:01.287 --> 00:09:04.749
Fortunately is not broken. 
You sprained your ankle.

76
00:09:04.873 --> 00:09:08.336
It appeals. Every morning and every afternoon.

77
00:09:08.461 --> 00:09:10.088
Come on, we'll help you up.

78
00:09:10.213 --> 00:09:11.881
Hurry up, gentlemen.

79
00:09:12.006 --> 00:09:14.092
Whitman, Frederick.

80
00:09:15.911 --> 00:09:18.622
Zimmerman, Raymond.

81
00:09:18.747 --> 00:09:20.374
Dismissed.

82
00:09:20.499 --> 00:09:22.311
Klaus did you know already.

83
00:09:23.960 --> 00:09:26.296
You'd better stay away from him.

84
00:09:26.421 --> 00:09:30.675
That's Bernd Weber. 
We call him the lifeguard.

85
00:09:33.052 --> 00:09:34.971
They read the camp newspaper.

86
00:09:35.096 --> 00:09:37.057
From the Allied camp.

87
00:09:37.182 --> 00:09:40.226
Which comes daily from
the camp in the north.

88
00:09:40.351 --> 00:09:43.104
They can make carbon paper there.

89
00:09:43.229 --> 00:09:45.940
Vinny has even built a radio.

90
00:09:46.066 --> 00:09:47.735
Here?

91
00:09:48.694 --> 00:09:51.362
With what? 
-With of anything and everything.

92
00:09:51.487 --> 00:09:55.240
You'd be amazed what you can
get here, if you just pay.

93
00:09:55.365 --> 00:09:59.412
If you can get your cigarettes or coffee,
which acts here are as a kind of gold.

94
00:09:59.537 --> 00:10:01.331
It'll also be an end with chocolate.

95
00:10:01.456 --> 00:10:04.167
And you have built a radio? 
-If they find ever ...

96
00:10:04.292 --> 00:10:08.422
I disappeared in isolation for a week. 
-At least.

97
00:10:08.547 --> 00:10:10.506
Gentlemen, we're home.

98
00:10:15.218 --> 00:10:17.555
Guys, this is Jack Findlay.

99
00:10:17.680 --> 00:10:21.976
He thinks he's Jack Dempsey, 
I think he's spying for the RAF.

100
00:10:22.101 --> 00:10:24.062
It's all part of.

101
00:10:24.187 --> 00:10:28.274
Whit, you are lying there. 
Cline, that's your bed.

102
00:10:28.399 --> 00:10:31.110
And Frank.

103
00:10:32.195 --> 00:10:35.657
No idea what Frank does. 
He lies all day on his nest.

104
00:10:35.782 --> 00:10:39.494
He cuts things out. Nevertheless, Frank?

105
00:10:42.955 --> 00:10:46.124
All that are needed to prevent boredom.

106
00:10:46.250 --> 00:10:50.171
I could use some boredom. 
-Otherwise I do.

107
00:10:50.296 --> 00:10:54.050
Because you're stupid. 
You still never know.

108
00:10:54.175 --> 00:10:56.887
It's like Chinese torture with water.

109
00:10:57.012 --> 00:11:00.765
You will be bound. 
They always drop a drop of water.

110
00:11:00.890 --> 00:11:03.475
Right on your forehead. 
Endlessly long.

111
00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:05.394
At first you think:

112
00:11:06.645 --> 00:11:09.107
If all this is, come on then.

113
00:11:10.984 --> 00:11:13.069
Because you're stupid ...

114
00:11:13.194 --> 00:11:14.882
and never knows.

115
00:11:16.488 --> 00:11:20.493
But not long after you all
want to exchange or say anything ...

116
00:11:20.618 --> 00:11:23.618
in order to be able
to hold back the next drop.

117
00:11:25.582 --> 00:11:27.125
But it does not stop.

118
00:11:28.710 --> 00:11:31.962
And then you hear things
that are not there ...

119
00:11:32.087 --> 00:11:36.466
and you see things that are not there. 
And finally...

120
00:11:37.427 --> 00:11:38.827
you become crazy.

121
00:11:39.762 --> 00:11:42.932
Every day here ...

122
00:11:43.057 --> 00:11:44.475
is a drop.

123
00:11:45.435 --> 00:11:46.835
Drip.

124
00:11:48.187 --> 00:11:49.897
Whatever.

125
00:11:50.023 --> 00:11:53.085
Size of us in
the second northern camp ...

126
00:11:53.650 --> 00:11:57.488
walked to the fence
wire to about to climb.

127
00:11:58.448 --> 00:12:02.198
He was shot when
he was not even halfway.

128
00:12:23.013 --> 00:12:25.140
Guys, we got company. 
-What now, captain?

129
00:12:25.265 --> 00:12:28.102
We crash. To jump.

130
00:12:28.227 --> 00:12:30.146
I am hit.

131
00:12:49.332 --> 00:12:52.707
Come on, Cline. 
Let's see what you got.

132
00:12:57.798 --> 00:12:59.199
I will go.

133
00:13:08.935 --> 00:13:10.894
I just grabbed the ball.

134
00:13:12.062 --> 00:13:13.462
Come on.

135
00:13:20.822 --> 00:13:22.448
You go in the hole.

136
00:13:23.324 --> 00:13:25.993
Three days. 
-I just grabbed the ball but.

137
00:13:26.118 --> 00:13:28.621
Enough, Lieutenant.

138
00:13:28.746 --> 00:13:32.040
All right then. 
Where are we going?

139
00:13:32.165 --> 00:13:33.792
Until later then.

140
00:13:41.843 --> 00:13:45.155
If you stick to the
rules, there is nothing wrong.

141
00:13:46.346 --> 00:13:49.785
If you do not follow
the rules, you have a problem.

142
00:13:53.938 --> 00:13:55.562
And you'll now pass it?

143
00:14:05.198 --> 00:14:07.618
What did Hermann? 
-He insists.

144
00:14:07.743 --> 00:14:11.289
He can do anything. 
Whit remains three days in solitary.

145
00:14:11.414 --> 00:14:14.167
But you might find this interesting.

146
00:14:14.292 --> 00:14:15.691
Boys.

147
00:14:21.632 --> 00:14:24.635
If we were to
bomb, he always did so.

148
00:14:24.760 --> 00:14:26.823
These stores are fine through.

149
00:14:28.055 --> 00:14:30.016
So my mother sings.

150
00:14:38.941 --> 00:14:40.342
The enemy.

151
00:14:55.707 --> 00:14:57.251
Do you want this one?

152
00:14:57.376 --> 00:14:58.919
That's mine.

153
00:14:59.044 --> 00:15:00.445
I want him.

154
00:15:28.824 --> 00:15:30.326
You do good, Whit.

155
00:15:31.286 --> 00:15:32.869
You're doing a good job.

156
00:15:41.962 --> 00:15:43.839
Peter? 
-Klaus.

157
00:15:46.842 --> 00:15:48.969
What are you doing here?

158
00:15:49.094 --> 00:15:52.557
Leave a week. I am going to mother.

159
00:15:52.682 --> 00:15:55.809
Then I thought: I'll
surprise you with a visit.

160
00:15:55.934 --> 00:15:57.351
That you succeeded.

161
00:15:58.603 --> 00:16:01.607
Man, you're my big brother. Do not Cry.

162
00:16:02.566 --> 00:16:05.277
Please, sit down. 
-I was all right?

163
00:16:05.402 --> 00:16:06.802
Why do not you sit.

164
00:16:10.072 --> 00:16:11.473
Seven days?

165
00:16:12.534 --> 00:16:16.246
Leave to the homeland. 
Did you do anything to the forefront?

166
00:16:16.371 --> 00:16:17.873
I earned to leave.

167
00:16:19.458 --> 00:16:20.859
Is it that bad?

168
00:16:24.838 --> 00:16:27.131
The Firer in his infinite wisdom ...

169
00:16:27.256 --> 00:16:30.551
surely something up his sleeve.

170
00:16:33.597 --> 00:16:36.308
And how are your daughters?

171
00:16:36.433 --> 00:16:37.833
Good.

172
00:16:38.810 --> 00:16:41.189
They are still at Uncle Fritz in Lubeck.

173
00:16:42.522 --> 00:16:46.108
Look, these are Dora and Gisela.

174
00:16:46.234 --> 00:16:47.734
They will soon be six.

175
00:16:49.237 --> 00:16:50.571
I have something for you. 
-What?

176
00:16:50.696 --> 00:16:52.324
And.

177
00:16:52.449 --> 00:16:57.412
I can get hold after an attack.

178
00:16:58.829 --> 00:17:02.000
A souvenir of your time at the enemy.

179
00:17:03.126 --> 00:17:05.671
To you I have nothing at all.

180
00:17:05.796 --> 00:17:08.632
Maybe you can make a curtain.

181
00:17:51.592 --> 00:17:52.992
Splendid.

182
00:17:58.849 --> 00:18:01.768
How did it decorated?

183
00:18:05.563 --> 00:18:08.126
I really do not
know what she was thinking.

184
00:18:16.742 --> 00:18:18.577
The evening before my departure ...

185
00:18:21.579 --> 00:18:25.416
I played her a song on the violin.

186
00:18:28.210 --> 00:18:30.210
I had written for her.

187
00:18:31.297 --> 00:18:33.611
Have you written a song for her?

188
00:18:36.469 --> 00:18:38.054
She loved it.

189
00:18:39.221 --> 00:18:41.140
When I was ready...

190
00:18:42.225 --> 00:18:44.538
she asked me to play it again.

191
00:18:45.938 --> 00:18:47.648
But I did not.

192
00:18:47.773 --> 00:18:49.172
I could not do it.

193
00:18:55.071 --> 00:18:58.196
Remember what they said when we were arrested?

194
00:19:02.203 --> 00:19:05.749
"For you the war is over."

195
00:19:07.751 --> 00:19:09.627
But that's not true.

196
00:19:09.752 --> 00:19:12.002
The war has only become different.

197
00:19:12.380 --> 00:19:13.798
I think...

198
00:19:16.342 --> 00:19:19.280
that more war is in our heads. 
Do you understand?

199
00:19:21.430 --> 00:19:24.685
Guys like you and Vinny
see the humor there on in.

200
00:19:27.311 --> 00:19:29.624
I just want to
make the best of it.

201
00:19:35.279 --> 00:19:37.341
We're only gone twice.

202
00:19:41.741 --> 00:19:43.327
I tell you one thing.

203
00:19:45.663 --> 00:19:47.832
She's the one.

204
00:19:47.957 --> 00:19:51.752
And when I get home, 
I'm going to marry her.

205
00:19:58.301 --> 00:19:59.701
Look.

206
00:20:00.636 --> 00:20:02.885
When this is finished, 
I let him go around.

207
00:20:04.140 --> 00:20:05.828
Someone had to do it.

208
00:20:06.809 --> 00:20:08.209
Goodnight.

209
00:20:57.985 --> 00:21:00.488
Can you do a little lightly?

210
00:21:03.615 --> 00:21:05.243
Can you draw a violin?

211
00:21:08.037 --> 00:21:10.915
So you're going to build a violin? 
-Why not?

212
00:21:11.040 --> 00:21:13.919
I make everything from wood. 
-Have you ever built a violin?

213
00:21:14.044 --> 00:21:17.088
I tried at school. 
-And, did it?

214
00:21:17.213 --> 00:21:20.799
And now you think that you succeed here? 
In a prison camp?

215
00:21:20.924 --> 00:21:23.426
I can try it. 
-There's no hardware store here.

216
00:21:23.551 --> 00:21:25.596
How to get tools?

217
00:21:34.815 --> 00:21:37.877
Can I help you? 
-I just admire your work.

218
00:21:39.068 --> 00:21:40.735
What do you want that glass?

219
00:21:41.861 --> 00:21:44.030
Nothing. The glass is not for sale.

220
00:21:44.156 --> 00:21:46.450
Negotiate not you agree?

221
00:21:46.576 --> 00:21:49.078
I can trade. 
-The playtime is over.

222
00:21:49.203 --> 00:21:51.497
Toe. 
-Unless...

223
00:21:52.872 --> 00:21:54.936
You have a dakkonijn for me.

224
00:21:55.960 --> 00:21:57.837
A what? 
-Cline, we should go.

225
00:21:57.962 --> 00:22:01.048
A dakkonijn. Such an.

226
00:22:01.173 --> 00:22:03.092
Want a cat?

227
00:22:03.217 --> 00:22:05.717
Get me a cat and get the glass.

228
00:22:18.460 --> 00:22:19.860
Over there.

229
00:22:20.860 --> 00:22:22.486
Where is he going?

230
00:22:33.496 --> 00:22:34.897
He's upstairs.

231
00:22:38.461 --> 00:22:40.212
Can I use the clothesline?

232
00:22:43.048 --> 00:22:44.987
If you are hanging it back again.

233
00:23:05.238 --> 00:23:07.615
If the cat is
playing with the bait ...

234
00:23:09.033 --> 00:23:12.870
the alarm sounds. 
I firmly pull the cord ...

235
00:23:12.995 --> 00:23:14.788
and crate falls.

236
00:23:15.869 --> 00:23:19.497
In theory, I have a roof rabit.

237
00:23:24.798 --> 00:23:26.362
It may take a while.

238
00:23:43.400 --> 00:23:46.319
And here come the f-holes. 
One on each side.

239
00:23:46.444 --> 00:23:49.698
F-holes? Oh, the S-type things.

240
00:23:49.823 --> 00:23:51.950
Precisely that S-like things.

241
00:24:11.136 --> 00:24:12.536
You're doing a good job.

242
00:24:13.305 --> 00:24:16.267
Where did you learn that? 
-Here and there.

243
00:24:17.750 --> 00:24:20.877
I did not know you were so religious. 
-Are I do not.

244
00:24:20.979 --> 00:24:22.480
So hot my son.

245
00:24:23.899 --> 00:24:25.299
I understand.

246
00:24:26.569 --> 00:24:28.863
How old is your son?

247
00:24:28.988 --> 00:24:30.388
What do you want?

248
00:24:33.825 --> 00:24:37.120
How did you come to that tool? 
I need a few things.

249
00:24:37.245 --> 00:24:38.914
I give my sources, not price.

250
00:24:39.039 --> 00:24:41.458
I can not hire you
stuff if you do not use?

251
00:24:41.583 --> 00:24:43.126
I always use them.

252
00:24:55.055 --> 00:24:57.807
McReady, get a bag.

253
00:25:08.109 --> 00:25:12.155
Here, you dakkonijn. 
Good luck to him to calm.

254
00:25:12.280 --> 00:25:14.699
Since I'm not so busy.

255
00:25:14.824 --> 00:25:16.224
This is our dinner.

256
00:25:19.455 --> 00:25:22.624
Fun anyway, they want a pet? 
-I suspected of not.

257
00:25:22.749 --> 00:25:24.833
All the effort that thing.

258
00:25:56.366 --> 00:25:58.118
THE NECK

259
00:25:59.202 --> 00:26:00.602
What about that?

260
00:26:01.454 --> 00:26:04.207
They are not thick enough
and the wood is bad.

261
00:26:04.332 --> 00:26:06.042
Do you sometimes need glue?

262
00:26:09.838 --> 00:26:11.423
Wood glue sure?

263
00:26:11.548 --> 00:26:14.422
Preferably, but ... 
-There can I get.

264
00:26:15.175 --> 00:26:16.760
If we make a deal.

265
00:26:17.721 --> 00:26:19.097
What did you have in mind?

266
00:26:19.222 --> 00:26:23.310
For starters, if I
give my source price ...

267
00:26:23.435 --> 00:26:25.770
it remains my source.

268
00:26:25.895 --> 00:26:27.523
Okay.

269
00:26:27.648 --> 00:26:31.192
What else? Somethings I want.

270
00:26:32.736 --> 00:26:34.135
What do you want?

271
00:26:35.070 --> 00:26:36.470
Fight me.

272
00:26:40.327 --> 00:26:43.121
Do you want to fight? Here?

273
00:26:45.748 --> 00:26:47.041
In the ring.

274
00:26:47.166 --> 00:26:48.752
That has already happened before.

275
00:26:48.877 --> 00:26:51.421
Those bullies even give us gloves.

276
00:26:51.546 --> 00:26:53.131
I can ask.

277
00:26:54.299 --> 00:26:57.678
Come on, Lieutenant. 
-How much do you want that violin?

278
00:26:58.720 --> 00:27:02.264
First I want to see that
glue to see or too sticky.

279
00:27:02.389 --> 00:27:05.726
Yes, Findlay. First make but for the glue.

280
00:27:05.851 --> 00:27:07.770
Turn your chair, chump.

281
00:27:07.896 --> 00:27:09.296
You're sitting on it.

282
00:27:14.319 --> 00:27:15.779
How do you mean?

283
00:27:48.270 --> 00:27:49.670
Before.

284
00:27:51.480 --> 00:27:53.605
Tonight we have a fisticuffs.

285
00:27:55.234 --> 00:27:57.695
Keep your gloves up and keep moving.

286
00:27:57.820 --> 00:28:00.009
Is that all you have to say?

287
00:28:00.699 --> 00:28:02.951
And success.

288
00:28:08.748 --> 00:28:11.310
I know how to
get wood for your neck.

289
00:28:12.376 --> 00:28:13.460
For the violin?

290
00:28:13.586 --> 00:28:17.336
I'll need a minute, so
keep at it until I'm back.

291
00:28:20.802 --> 00:28:22.202
Put it on, Cline.

292
00:28:24.179 --> 00:28:26.098
Cline, take him to graze.

293
00:28:31.605 --> 00:28:35.858
Guys, I want a fair fight. 
Findlay, honestly.

294
00:28:35.983 --> 00:28:37.383
Hail each other.

295
00:29:14.146 --> 00:29:15.546
Are you down?

296
00:29:21.488 --> 00:29:22.888
You're down, Cline.

297
00:29:53.102 --> 00:29:55.312
One two...

298
00:29:55.437 --> 00:29:57.648
three four...

299
00:29:57.773 --> 00:30:03.320
five, six, seven, eight, nine.

300
00:30:12.163 --> 00:30:15.249
One two...

301
00:30:15.374 --> 00:30:19.627
three four five...

302
00:30:19.752 --> 00:30:21.213
six ... 
-Aside.

303
00:30:21.338 --> 00:30:23.591
seven ... 
-Plenty.

304
00:30:37.062 --> 00:30:39.939
One two...

305
00:30:40.064 --> 00:30:41.150
three ... 
-Look.

306
00:30:41.275 --> 00:30:43.527
four ... 
-No problem, a breeze.

307
00:30:43.652 --> 00:30:46.864
six, seven, eight ...

308
00:30:46.989 --> 00:30:49.491
Stand up. - nine, ten.

309
00:30:52.912 --> 00:30:55.247
Everthing allright? 
Are you still there?

310
00:30:56.123 --> 00:30:57.523
That was amazing.

311
00:30:59.919 --> 00:31:02.922
You keep surprising me, Lieutenant.

312
00:31:03.797 --> 00:31:07.091
Whit, scraping glue but the list.

313
00:31:07.216 --> 00:31:08.616
I will do it.

314
00:31:13.223 --> 00:31:16.435
That was fun, friend. 
-Yes, great.

315
00:31:16.560 --> 00:31:19.438
I have with the RAF
guys in camp seven spoken.

316
00:31:19.563 --> 00:31:22.734
If we need more material, 
I can scratch it from their seats.

317
00:31:22.859 --> 00:31:25.319
Especially after our first-rate performance.

318
00:31:25.444 --> 00:31:27.318
There you busy for a while with it.

319
00:31:29.072 --> 00:31:30.572
Then I have to do something.

320
00:31:40.458 --> 00:31:42.253
Before.

321
00:31:42.378 --> 00:31:43.941
I think it will succeed.

322
00:31:44.421 --> 00:31:47.049
Thank you, Vinny. 
-You deserve it, champ.

323
00:31:47.174 --> 00:31:50.469
You look terrible. 
If a piece of meat at the butcher.

324
00:31:50.594 --> 00:31:52.054
But what can you do.

325
00:31:53.764 --> 00:31:55.974
Five half. 
-On the side?

326
00:31:56.099 --> 00:31:58.393
I think so. On both sides.

327
00:32:00.728 --> 00:32:02.648
I use this not.

328
00:32:02.773 --> 00:32:04.173
You can borrow him.

329
00:32:39.018 --> 00:32:42.938
It's called off-white, but
I think it's just white.

330
00:32:46.149 --> 00:32:47.549
I miss you.

331
00:32:48.902 --> 00:32:50.302
Do you see me?

332
00:33:06.878 --> 00:33:08.278
Are you succeeding?

333
00:33:09.797 --> 00:33:12.801
It's just great to keep working at it.

334
00:33:15.638 --> 00:33:19.349
It can be published.

335
00:33:20.266 --> 00:33:23.354
So I'm at my best

336
00:33:23.479 --> 00:33:26.232
The camp boys make copies of it ...

337
00:33:26.357 --> 00:33:28.295
to distribute them afterwards.

338
00:33:32.571 --> 00:33:36.070
We know someone with
has access to Hermann's office?

339
00:33:37.742 --> 00:33:39.142
What do you want?

340
00:33:40.703 --> 00:33:42.331
His blind.

341
00:33:44.875 --> 00:33:48.170
Someone from west knows the
Russian who are cleaning Hermann's office.

342
00:33:48.295 --> 00:33:51.482
How many roller blinds do you want? 
-Four is enough.

343
00:33:52.883 --> 00:33:54.282
Please.

344
00:34:06.896 --> 00:34:08.565
Enter.

345
00:34:30.253 --> 00:34:32.942
You like American coffee, if I understand?

346
00:34:42.724 --> 00:34:44.124
And?

347
00:34:48.479 --> 00:34:49.879
Never mind.

348
00:34:52.400 --> 00:34:53.903
What is it?

349
00:34:54.028 --> 00:34:58.527
I found something in the camp. 
I thought you would like it.

350
00:34:59.991 --> 00:35:01.492
Well, for the day with them.

351
00:35:08.583 --> 00:35:10.293
You think this is funny?

352
00:35:12.336 --> 00:35:13.737
Obviously not.

353
00:35:17.842 --> 00:35:19.242
The enemy.

354
00:35:34.484 --> 00:35:36.486
Who drew this?

355
00:35:43.076 --> 00:35:45.286
You signed this.

356
00:35:45.411 --> 00:35:48.411
No sir. I really do
not know who has drawn anything.

357
00:35:51.918 --> 00:35:53.419
Search his bed.

358
00:36:05.014 --> 00:36:06.702
How do these get there?

359
00:36:19.904 --> 00:36:21.303
In solitary.

360
00:36:27.495 --> 00:36:28.895
Stop.

361
00:37:54.499 --> 00:37:56.376
Herr, I know something.

362
00:37:57.961 --> 00:38:00.254
Well, boys. Just slide.

363
00:38:03.423 --> 00:38:06.928
How long has he to stay in solitary? 
-Ten.

364
00:38:07.053 --> 00:38:08.972
Ten days? 
-Sir.

365
00:38:09.097 --> 00:38:11.596
He needed some stuff. Please.

366
00:38:15.310 --> 00:38:18.815
Here. 
-Well, I'll give it to him ...

367
00:38:18.940 --> 00:38:22.565
if you give me something. 
-You just got some.

368
00:38:24.570 --> 00:38:26.072
Do you contribute also?

369
00:38:27.364 --> 00:38:29.864
Lieutenant Romero. 
-Is it an order, sir?

370
00:38:33.203 --> 00:38:34.746
No, not a command.

371
00:38:34.871 --> 00:38:36.708
No, the box.

372
00:38:38.876 --> 00:38:40.670
Here our food is in.

373
00:38:43.256 --> 00:38:45.193
I will give it to him. 
-Wait.

374
00:38:48.677 --> 00:38:50.077
This also.

375
00:39:13.660 --> 00:39:15.060
Cline.

376
00:39:25.797 --> 00:39:27.736
What's the problem, Lieutenant?

377
00:39:30.011 --> 00:39:34.698
Then do at least a little effort
to get along with the other boys.

378
00:39:35.015 --> 00:39:37.684
Do it if necessary for your country.

379
00:39:37.809 --> 00:39:39.269
For my country?

380
00:39:39.394 --> 00:39:42.332
I'm one day after Pearl Harbor enlisted.

381
00:39:42.814 --> 00:39:45.484
Do not look so surprised.

382
00:39:45.609 --> 00:39:48.235
I wanted the Japs do give their miserably.

383
00:39:49.696 --> 00:39:52.446
But no, she informed me as bombardier.

384
00:39:53.450 --> 00:39:55.077
I had to go to Europe.

385
00:39:56.453 --> 00:39:58.790
That was my duty to the fatherland.

386
00:39:58.915 --> 00:40:01.291
Throwing bombs on German families.

387
00:40:01.416 --> 00:40:02.816
Hold on, son.

388
00:40:03.835 --> 00:40:07.214
We not bomb civilians. 
-If your bombardier was better than I ...

389
00:40:07.339 --> 00:40:09.839
have no fixed houses demolished.

390
00:40:11.510 --> 00:40:13.762
When we were brought down ...

391
00:40:13.887 --> 00:40:15.287
and imprisoned.

392
00:40:16.808 --> 00:40:18.808
I've seen what we inflict.

393
00:40:20.937 --> 00:40:24.481
I saw a boy
about age as my son.

394
00:40:25.524 --> 00:40:26.900
Death.

395
00:40:27.025 --> 00:40:28.777
In the arms of his mother.

396
00:40:34.116 --> 00:40:36.741
I thought we were on the right side.

397
00:40:46.712 --> 00:40:49.173
This war is not black and white.

398
00:40:50.340 --> 00:40:52.134
But I know, Frank ...

399
00:40:53.176 --> 00:40:55.175
that this war ever ends.

400
00:40:56.262 --> 00:41:00.517
And how we look against
it here will be really important.

401
00:41:26.876 --> 00:41:28.420
Here with the charcoal.

402
00:41:41.725 --> 00:41:43.124
One week there.

403
00:42:16.217 --> 00:42:18.804
Captain? 
-Day, Al.

404
00:42:22.599 --> 00:42:24.101
I could not sleep.

405
00:42:24.226 --> 00:42:27.104
That is quite normal for you first.

406
00:42:28.772 --> 00:42:31.733
And for eight apparently.

407
00:42:31.858 --> 00:42:33.651
This is your eighth mission?

408
00:42:34.527 --> 00:42:37.965
You know I'm first lieutenant? Yes, Captain.

409
00:42:40.284 --> 00:42:44.913
Exactly one year ago I was
sitting in math to dream ...

410
00:42:45.038 --> 00:42:47.291
to be here.

411
00:42:47.416 --> 00:42:49.501
In the air.

412
00:42:49.626 --> 00:42:51.962
To throw bombs on the Nazis.

413
00:42:54.171 --> 00:42:56.882
It's a dream come true.

414
00:43:04.016 --> 00:43:05.766
Sir?

415
00:43:05.891 --> 00:43:07.518
If we now ...

416
00:43:07.643 --> 00:43:11.899
We are talking about
tomorrow, when we get back.

417
00:43:14.443 --> 00:43:16.570
But if we ... 
-Alistair.

418
00:43:16.695 --> 00:43:19.633
If we do not come back? 
-If we are back.

419
00:43:22.158 --> 00:43:23.993
Yes, Captain?

420
00:43:24.118 --> 00:43:25.518
Yes, Captain.

421
00:43:28.164 --> 00:43:32.002
Whit, I'm glad you're there again. 
-I want water.

422
00:43:33.503 --> 00:43:34.903
I rule.

423
00:43:37.090 --> 00:43:39.509
Thanks. 
-You must salute.

424
00:43:39.635 --> 00:43:41.035
Forget it.

425
00:43:56.359 --> 00:43:58.778
Come, let me.

426
00:44:04.993 --> 00:44:06.392
Cline.

427
00:44:07.370 --> 00:44:09.559
I do not remember what she looks like.

428
00:44:15.795 --> 00:44:18.233
I could always remember every detail me.

429
00:44:21.385 --> 00:44:23.635
And now I do not
know what she looks like.

430
00:44:26.597 --> 00:44:28.599
You must persevere, friend.

431
00:44:30.977 --> 00:44:33.040
You'll remember everything.

432
00:44:35.106 --> 00:44:36.506
Okay?

433
00:44:37.191 --> 00:44:38.591
Everything.

434
00:44:40.112 --> 00:44:42.155
But you have to persevere.

435
00:44:45.950 --> 00:44:48.494
You'll remember everything.

436
00:44:48.619 --> 00:44:50.020
I promise.

437
00:44:56.377 --> 00:44:57.877
Man, you're ugly.

438
00:45:00.047 --> 00:45:02.860
How did you ever get all the girls?

439
00:45:32.788 --> 00:45:34.188
Backwards.

440
00:45:37.293 --> 00:45:38.693
Do you hear me?

441
00:45:40.422 --> 00:45:41.822
Backwards.

442
00:45:44.634 --> 00:45:48.071
If I tell you
to reverse, you step backwards.

443
00:45:50.556 --> 00:45:53.059
That's an order.

444
00:45:53.184 --> 00:45:54.977
Whit, what are you doing?

445
00:45:56.354 --> 00:45:58.147
Let's go inside.

446
00:45:58.272 --> 00:46:00.817
He's not as good since ...

447
00:46:04.153 --> 00:46:05.553
Thank you, Findlay.

448
00:47:38.915 --> 00:47:40.416
Whit, nee.

449
00:47:44.754 --> 00:47:46.153
Cline.

450
00:47:57.016 --> 00:47:58.415
Stand still.

451
00:48:03.022 --> 00:48:04.422
Stop.

452
00:48:49.734 --> 00:48:51.134
Wait.

453
00:48:52.613 --> 00:48:54.615
You were with him.

454
00:48:54.740 --> 00:48:57.115
He tried to stop him. 
-Yes.

455
00:49:14.343 --> 00:49:16.679
You know what I learned English?

456
00:49:18.222 --> 00:49:19.622
In Amerika.

457
00:49:20.557 --> 00:49:21.975
Boston College.

458
00:49:22.935 --> 00:49:24.769
I studied mathematics.

459
00:49:28.315 --> 00:49:29.941
I'm a fan of the Red Sox.

460
00:49:31.860 --> 00:49:33.613
I hate the Yankees.

461
00:50:17.072 --> 00:50:20.075
Here they come. 
-We have become.

462
00:50:20.200 --> 00:50:22.575
What now? Two engine is stopped.

463
00:50:26.081 --> 00:50:29.042
Get outta here. To jump.

464
00:50:29.167 --> 00:50:31.586
'A Long Way across the Sky'.

465
00:51:35.567 --> 00:51:36.967
We go.

466
00:51:40.989 --> 00:51:42.389
This is Bernd.

467
00:51:44.409 --> 00:51:45.810
Come on.

468
00:52:05.805 --> 00:52:08.430
Those bastards have moved his mattress.

469
00:52:09.392 --> 00:52:10.936
Until someone comes back.

470
00:52:43.926 --> 00:52:46.555
TERRIBLE NEWS,  THIS WHIT
HAD TO BE WITH YOU

471
00:52:46.680 --> 00:52:48.890
FROM THE HOUSE

472
00:53:29.263 --> 00:53:34.476
CLINE PLAYS FOR HIS GIRL ROMANTIC

473
00:53:45.821 --> 00:53:47.407
I need resin.

474
00:53:51.369 --> 00:53:53.829
All around us are trees around.

475
00:53:54.788 --> 00:53:56.977
With the resin is so good.

476
00:54:30.741 --> 00:54:34.554
We could have done something more fun. 
A baseball bat or something.

477
00:55:28.883 --> 00:55:30.802
STRINGING BOW 

478
00:55:30.927 --> 00:55:32.344
I'm perplexed.

479
00:55:32.469 --> 00:55:33.869
Does anyone have an idea?

480
00:55:35.180 --> 00:55:36.723
I'll ask around.

481
00:55:43.689 --> 00:55:48.069
Your new home. 
-You are now captives of the Reich.

482
00:55:52.239 --> 00:55:57.285
Have you ever seen Gary Cooper
in baseball movie as Lou Gehrig?

483
00:55:57.411 --> 00:56:00.164
No. 
-No? A good movie.

484
00:56:00.289 --> 00:56:01.689
Come on.

485
00:56:05.711 --> 00:56:07.797
Does it happen to have a ...

486
00:56:09.256 --> 00:56:10.925
bow?

487
00:56:12.134 --> 00:56:13.822
Then you must be Brian.

488
00:56:17.056 --> 00:56:18.457
Are you?

489
00:56:19.768 --> 00:56:22.561
Yes, apparently. 
That was here when I got here.

490
00:56:22.686 --> 00:56:25.230
Do you use the bow
to keep the window open?

491
00:56:25.355 --> 00:56:27.775
Well, if it stinks. How so?

492
00:56:27.900 --> 00:56:29.300
Come along.

493
00:56:30.069 --> 00:56:31.757
And take that bow with.

494
00:56:36.158 --> 00:56:37.493
Damn, man.

495
00:56:37.618 --> 00:56:39.830
What do you want for that bow?

496
00:56:39.955 --> 00:56:41.705
You'll get it from me.

497
00:56:42.873 --> 00:56:44.273
Have fun with it.

498
00:56:45.917 --> 00:56:47.377
Thanks.

499
00:56:47.502 --> 00:56:49.004
Are we lucky.

500
00:56:50.256 --> 00:56:51.924
Unbelievable.

501
00:57:00.975 --> 00:57:02.977
Guys, we got company.

502
00:57:05.521 --> 00:57:06.921
I'll help you.

503
00:57:07.773 --> 00:57:09.858
Do you want this one? 
-I want that.

504
00:57:11.485 --> 00:57:13.319
What do you want?

505
00:57:13.444 --> 00:57:16.114
You did not saluted? 
-From his life day.

506
00:57:16.239 --> 00:57:18.617
No, he had something else in mind.

507
00:57:20.244 --> 00:57:24.498
Does he want alcohol? 
No, he wants the distillation apparatus.

508
00:57:24.623 --> 00:57:26.792
Sir, I can't ... 
-Sorry.

509
00:57:26.917 --> 00:57:28.317
It's okay.

510
00:57:32.089 --> 00:57:34.713
Help me to build a new one.

511
00:57:38.052 --> 00:57:41.640
Packer will not play. 
He will not lose.

512
00:57:42.683 --> 00:57:47.395
You may be the highest-ranking here,
you are the worst card player ever.

513
00:57:47.520 --> 00:57:49.084
I don't argue.

514
00:57:54.445 --> 00:57:58.114
Sir, can you hand me the bow? 
-Of course. Please.

515
00:57:58.239 --> 00:57:59.640
Thank you.

516
00:58:06.539 --> 00:58:08.207
Attention.

517
00:58:08.333 --> 00:58:10.586
Packer, come along.

518
00:58:24.224 --> 00:58:25.624
Wrong lot.

519
00:58:26.392 --> 00:58:30.581
German troops have surrounded the majority of Americans.

520
00:58:33.776 --> 00:58:36.486
This is a big blow for the Allies.

521
00:58:36.611 --> 00:58:39.448
Yesterday it was thought that
the war would soon end.

522
00:58:39.573 --> 00:58:41.575
That, today, is completely different.

523
00:58:41.700 --> 00:58:47.413
The war effort has been thrown
back a year, possibly even longer.

524
00:58:47.538 --> 00:58:49.852
I don't want another year to sit here.

525
00:58:54.712 --> 00:58:56.525
You have heard it all.

526
00:58:57.006 --> 00:59:01.262
The authorities make changes to the protocol.

527
00:59:01.387 --> 00:59:03.389
Food rations can be reduced.

528
00:59:03.514 --> 00:59:08.101
All deliveries of the Red
Cross be discontinued until further notice.

529
00:59:17.569 --> 00:59:19.989
Give your ID tags once. 
-Why so?

530
00:59:20.114 --> 00:59:21.907
Come on, it's Christmas Eve.

531
00:59:28.079 --> 00:59:29.479
Thank you.

532
00:59:39.257 --> 00:59:43.303
My father dreamed that you would
be home in about nine days.

533
00:59:44.470 --> 00:59:46.097
I don't know.

534
00:59:46.222 --> 00:59:48.558
I think every time:

535
00:59:48.683 --> 00:59:52.521
Peace on earth to men of good will.

536
00:59:52.646 --> 00:59:55.774
Again and again.

537
01:00:57.001 --> 01:00:58.503
Crikey, Cline.

538
01:00:59.837 --> 01:01:01.382
That was beautiful.

539
01:01:02.423 --> 01:01:03.823
More.

540
01:01:25.405 --> 01:01:26.968
McReady, I can't hear.

541
01:01:35.081 --> 01:01:36.916
Again.

542
01:01:53.933 --> 01:01:55.333
Colonel.

543
01:01:56.269 --> 01:01:59.397
I thought you would leave on Christmas?

544
01:01:59.522 --> 01:02:01.065
I was on leave.

545
01:02:01.190 --> 01:02:03.003
I received this message.

546
01:02:04.277 --> 01:02:05.778
I'm so sorry.

547
01:02:09.781 --> 01:02:12.619
I know you were
very fond of your brother.

548
01:02:12.744 --> 01:02:16.289
I know this isn't the right time ...

549
01:02:16.414 --> 01:02:21.039
but you wouldn't appreciate if withheld the information.

550
01:02:23.963 --> 01:02:25.363
No that...

551
01:02:27.841 --> 01:02:29.241
You have done well.

552
01:02:34.140 --> 01:02:35.540
Thank you.

553
01:02:53.159 --> 01:02:54.827
Another song, Cline.

554
01:04:27.754 --> 01:04:29.339
Merry Christmas, sir.

555
01:04:34.051 --> 01:04:36.053
Give me the violin. 
-No sir.

556
01:04:37.262 --> 01:04:41.225
Give me the violin.

557
01:04:42.559 --> 01:04:47.023
Stop. Give me the violin.

558
01:04:47.148 --> 01:04:48.733
No. 
- Let it go.

559
01:04:48.858 --> 01:04:52.486
Give me the violin. 
-Okay.

560
01:04:52.611 --> 01:04:54.113
Here.

561
01:04:54.238 --> 01:04:55.822
Please.

562
01:06:00.178 --> 01:06:05.018
1st Lieutenant Cline has attacked a German officer.

563
01:06:05.143 --> 01:06:09.271
Thus he remains locked
until further notice in solitary.

564
01:06:13.733 --> 01:06:15.527
Klaus doesn't allow anybody.

565
01:06:16.820 --> 01:06:20.445
Georg negotiates even extra food or blankets.

566
01:06:20.949 --> 01:06:22.512
None of these bastards.

567
01:07:20.550 --> 01:07:22.218
Everything will be fine.

568
01:07:30.143 --> 01:07:35.064
According Eisenhower, the Russians will be
in a few weeks in Berlin.

569
01:07:37.734 --> 01:07:40.737
Come on, Frankie. Laugh again.

570
01:07:40.862 --> 01:07:44.908
Do you really think the
Krauts let us free the Russians?

571
01:07:45.784 --> 01:07:48.745
They'll shoot us out before the Russians there.

572
01:07:48.870 --> 01:07:51.205
Come on, Frankie. 
We are going home.

573
01:07:51.330 --> 01:07:52.707
Home, Frankie.

574
01:07:52.832 --> 01:07:54.707
Guys, he's right.

575
01:07:55.961 --> 01:07:59.381
They will undoubtedly bring us if they withdraw.

576
01:07:59.506 --> 01:08:02.259
Either way, a death sentence.

577
01:08:04.386 --> 01:08:05.787
The enemy.

578
01:08:10.433 --> 01:08:11.833
Help him, boys.

579
01:08:20.986 --> 01:08:25.031
Cline, do you know what they say on the radio? 
That the Russians are close.

580
01:08:25.156 --> 01:08:27.075
They're talking about that weeks.

581
01:08:40.046 --> 01:08:41.446
This is yours.

582
01:09:06.907 --> 01:09:08.617
Sergeant Major.

583
01:09:59.585 --> 01:10:01.147
I'm not asleep.

584
01:10:03.629 --> 01:10:05.339
Here please.

585
01:10:14.932 --> 01:10:17.518
I was hoping I
could hear you play again.

586
01:10:18.561 --> 01:10:20.936
If you want, I'll help with the repairs.

587
01:10:22.231 --> 01:10:26.294
I had hoped that someone
would help me to the latrine.

588
01:10:29.031 --> 01:10:30.991
I got it.

589
01:10:31.116 --> 01:10:34.785
I'll help you there, but
the rest is up to you.

590
01:10:36.412 --> 01:10:37.812
Come on.

591
01:10:55.306 --> 01:10:56.724
I need help.

592
01:11:00.854 --> 01:11:02.253
Friend.

593
01:11:03.356 --> 01:11:04.815
How are you?

594
01:11:06.858 --> 01:11:08.922
You look like a newborn baby.

595
01:11:10.321 --> 01:11:13.699
They are nervous. 
The Russians are very close.

596
01:11:13.824 --> 01:11:17.161
That's soon over, our
hard wheat soup and bread.

597
01:11:17.286 --> 01:11:18.687
For you.

598
01:11:23.167 --> 01:11:24.710
Hold on, friend.

599
01:11:39.767 --> 01:11:45.606
If the Russians are approaching,
the Germans will drain us.

600
01:11:45.731 --> 01:11:48.732
What do they do
to prisoners who can't walk?

601
01:11:49.111 --> 01:11:51.070
Don't worry about that.

602
01:11:51.195 --> 01:11:53.281
We really won't leave you behind.

603
01:11:54.990 --> 01:11:56.803
Just make sure that you get better.

604
01:12:15.468 --> 01:12:16.970
How long do you think?

605
01:12:18.096 --> 01:12:19.932
Maybe another week.

606
01:12:21.434 --> 01:12:22.834
And then...

607
01:12:27.355 --> 01:12:29.231
We follow our orders.

608
01:12:35.740 --> 01:12:37.742
We are ten times as much.

609
01:12:37.867 --> 01:12:41.204
If everyone participates, we have a chance. 
-Then they will be many deaths.

610
01:12:41.329 --> 01:12:43.039
With all due respect, sir.

611
01:12:43.164 --> 01:12:46.541
If we don't do anything we'll
soon run into a death march ...

612
01:12:46.666 --> 01:12:49.605
According to the BBC it's
the equally in other camps also.

613
01:12:50.463 --> 01:12:54.675
Some boys from barrack
7 have quite a few.

614
01:12:54.800 --> 01:12:56.238
I can arrange more.

615
01:12:57.053 --> 01:12:59.928
If I perish go, I'm fighting.

616
01:13:05.101 --> 01:13:07.604
I'm with him, sir.

617
01:13:07.729 --> 01:13:09.130
It worth.

618
01:13:11.192 --> 01:13:14.195
I understand you. 
-Frank. Stop that.

619
01:13:14.320 --> 01:13:16.112
It's okay, Vinny.

620
01:13:18.490 --> 01:13:21.661
To begin, we need glue.

621
01:14:38.445 --> 01:14:40.740
Anthony Baker. 
-Hyee!

622
01:14:42.782 --> 01:14:44.826
Oscar Grey.

623
01:14:46.202 --> 01:14:48.371
William C. Bryant.

624
01:14:49.873 --> 01:14:52.001
Jack Findlay.

625
01:14:54.336 --> 01:14:56.129
Allan O'Clark.

626
01:14:58.757 --> 01:15:01.510
Marion Collins.

627
01:15:01.636 --> 01:15:03.054
Day captain.

628
01:15:03.179 --> 01:15:06.098
Lester R. Evans.

629
01:15:23.532 --> 01:15:24.932
What did I say?

630
01:15:25.910 --> 01:15:28.847
We would talk about
it when we got back.

631
01:15:30.038 --> 01:15:31.726
And we're back, Captain.

632
01:15:32.749 --> 01:15:35.001
I have important advice for you.

633
01:15:35.126 --> 01:15:37.045
Always trust your pilot.

634
01:15:37.170 --> 01:15:39.506
And if I just want to go home?

635
01:15:40.590 --> 01:15:42.385
I want to go home.

636
01:15:43.885 --> 01:15:46.137
Clair Cline.

637
01:15:46.263 --> 01:15:47.663
Here.

638
01:15:49.266 --> 01:15:50.666
Here I am.

639
01:15:58.108 --> 01:15:59.507
I have something for you.

640
01:16:08.827 --> 01:16:11.828
You should not look at me. 
This is Frankies' work.

641
01:16:12.498 --> 01:16:14.250
I've had a lot of help.

642
01:16:15.500 --> 01:16:17.125
Hopefully he still does it.

643
01:16:25.343 --> 01:16:28.468
Thank you, Frank. 
-Then I had to do something.

644
01:16:30.348 --> 01:16:32.517
Why'm not going to vote?

645
01:16:33.435 --> 01:16:35.312
Listen how it sounds.

646
01:16:35.437 --> 01:16:38.773
Not now, guys.

647
01:16:40.775 --> 01:16:42.320
But thanks anyway.

648
01:16:59.085 --> 01:17:00.485
You.

649
01:17:01.296 --> 01:17:05.091
Lieutenant Colonel Packer, the
commander wants to see you.

650
01:17:10.346 --> 01:17:11.973
Now it's going to happen.

651
01:17:13.266 --> 01:17:14.810
We have more blades.

652
01:17:14.935 --> 01:17:18.605
In the camp are men
ready to fight if necessary.

653
01:17:18.730 --> 01:17:21.107
If the Germans come
back, they will experience something.

654
01:17:21.232 --> 01:17:22.567
Not yet.

655
01:17:22.692 --> 01:17:26.154
We need to hear what Pack has to say. 
We are waiting for him.

656
01:17:26.279 --> 01:17:27.679
If he comes back.

657
01:17:40.751 --> 01:17:45.507
Lieutenant Colonel Packer. 
You're the top American officer.

658
01:17:45.632 --> 01:17:48.844
I must inform you that
Russian troops are approaching the camp.

659
01:17:48.969 --> 01:17:51.763
In two days they'll be here.

660
01:17:53.765 --> 01:17:56.768
I have been ordered from above to ...

661
01:17:56.893 --> 01:18:00.020
to evacuate the camp immediately.

662
01:18:00.145 --> 01:18:04.025
Within two hours the prisoners
should be ready to go.

663
01:18:04.150 --> 01:18:07.028
We will bring you to a safe place.

664
01:18:09.406 --> 01:18:11.156
We're not going anywhere.

665
01:18:11.282 --> 01:18:13.451
Leaving with you?

666
01:18:13.577 --> 01:18:15.077
It is a death march.

667
01:18:16.037 --> 01:18:19.499
Shoot us, because my men aren't going nowhere.

668
01:18:19.624 --> 01:18:21.418
We stay here to wait for the Russians.

669
01:18:21.543 --> 01:18:25.213
This is of no use
for you and the prisoners.

670
01:18:26.213 --> 01:18:28.007
They don't want to die.

671
01:18:29.800 --> 01:18:32.177
We crash. Leap.

672
01:18:53.033 --> 01:18:55.327
Stop. Stand still.

673
01:18:55.452 --> 01:18:57.621
Stop, no.

674
01:19:27.192 --> 01:19:29.903
I follow ... 
-In a few hours, the Russians here.

675
01:19:30.028 --> 01:19:33.405
But if you ... 
-It's over. It's too late.

676
01:21:17.301 --> 01:21:18.701
Who...

677
01:21:19.303 --> 01:21:21.241
wrote this music?

678
01:21:25.352 --> 01:21:26.751
I.

679
01:21:28.020 --> 01:21:29.420
For my wife.

680
01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:51.752
Good luck with the Russians.
