1
00:00:04.105 --> 00:00:06.983
What I loved about them
from the minute I saw the video,


2
00:00:07.776 --> 00:00:09.402
I knew they were driven.

3
00:00:09.486 --> 00:00:12.655
I knew they were artists.
I knew they were passionate.


4
00:00:12.739 --> 00:00:15.617
They had this incredible, goal.

5
00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:17.368
And they were making it happen.

6
00:00:19.871 --> 00:00:22.957
You just called out
the grandaddy of visual entertainment.


7
00:00:23.041 --> 00:00:24.751
This is absolutely groundbreaking.

8
00:00:24.834 --> 00:00:26.961
We had never done anything
like that before.


9
00:00:27.045 --> 00:00:28.880
<i>Iwájú</i> is set in Lagos, Nigeria.

10
00:00:28.963 --> 00:00:31.174
Lagos has a certain audacity as a place.

11
00:00:31.257 --> 00:00:34.594
Look at you smiling. You know! You know
you're giving me a high price!


12
00:00:34.677 --> 00:00:37.430
There's a way it just
wills itself to be what it wants to be.


13
00:00:37.514 --> 00:00:41.726
I want people to see the good, the bad,
the ugly. You know, all the quirks.


14
00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:42.852
Puff puff!

15
00:00:42.936 --> 00:00:45.063
We've tried to be authentic
in every layer.


16
00:00:45.146 --> 00:00:47.023
You know,
I've been living in Lagos all my life.


17
00:00:47.107 --> 00:00:50.568
The indigo fabric is special to Nigeria.

18
00:00:50.652 --> 00:00:53.113
The voices you're going to hear
are homegrown.


19
00:00:53.196 --> 00:00:55.698
She's pretty much me in animated form.

20
00:00:55.782 --> 00:00:58.034
This is not us making up a world.

21
00:00:58.118 --> 00:01:03.123
This is us doing our best
to portray a very real world.


22
00:01:03.206 --> 00:01:05.250
Seeing the story come to life…

23
00:01:05.333 --> 00:01:09.796
It was just really the three of us
who had a dream that we believed in


24
00:01:09.879 --> 00:01:11.589
and worked very hard.

25
00:01:15.009 --> 00:01:16.970
<i>There is that weight</i>
<i>of responsibility.</i>


26
00:01:17.053 --> 00:01:18.221
<i>What if I fail?</i>

27
00:01:18.304 --> 00:01:22.642
As an African mam,
drawing or doing art is nothing.


28
00:01:22.725 --> 00:01:24.477
That's Nigerian mentality.

29
00:01:24.561 --> 00:01:27.814
But I think it's important
to take a leap of faith.


30
00:01:30.066 --> 00:01:31.276
We run the show here.

31
00:01:31.359 --> 00:01:33.111
No. You don't wanna
work with me anymore, Ziki?


32
00:01:33.194 --> 00:01:34.654
Love me, come on!

33
00:01:34.738 --> 00:01:39.617
- I'm starting to see how big it will be.
- Are you ready for Africa?


34
00:01:39.701 --> 00:01:43.037
Yeah!

35
00:01:52.255 --> 00:01:59.179
<i>Iwájú</i> is actually inspired by
a story that happened to a friend of mine.


36
00:01:59.721 --> 00:02:02.515
She was driving back home
from the airport one day


37
00:02:02.599 --> 00:02:08.271
and suddenly armed men tried to block
her car and she did something crazy.


38
00:02:08.354 --> 00:02:14.110
She jumped into the water and…
…she was actually able to swim to safety.


39
00:02:14.611 --> 00:02:18.531
So I always knew that I wanted
to revisit that story at some point.


40
00:02:18.615 --> 00:02:23.536
But "some point" came
a lot sooner than I thought it would


41
00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:26.372
in a way that I never saw coming.

42
00:02:31.628 --> 00:02:35.799
I talk a lot
about Walt Disney's belief


43
00:02:35.882 --> 00:02:40.220
that we should be evolving as storytellers
all the time. I think about it a lot.


44
00:02:41.054 --> 00:02:44.641
I remember meeting with Bob Iger
when I accepted this role


45
00:02:45.225 --> 00:02:48.520
and his permission to be fearless.

46
00:02:49.229 --> 00:02:50.522
I set a goal right away,

47
00:02:50.605 --> 00:02:54.192
which is that I want us to not just
tell the stories of the world,


48
00:02:54.275 --> 00:02:56.111
but by the people of the world.

49
00:02:56.194 --> 00:03:01.116
And I really was excited to connect
with artists from around the world,


50
00:03:01.199 --> 00:03:04.119
and do kinds of collaborations
we'd never done before.


51
00:03:05.328 --> 00:03:08.623
Jenn and I had a meeting
and we were talking about the studio


52
00:03:08.706 --> 00:03:10.667
and, really, her vision for it.

53
00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:14.671
And she started to go into an example
of where she had read this article


54
00:03:14.754 --> 00:03:18.216
about this comic book company in Africa.

55
00:03:18.299 --> 00:03:20.218
I was lying in bed one morning

56
00:03:20.301 --> 00:03:22.470
and every morning,
I read the news on my phone,


57
00:03:22.554 --> 00:03:24.097
and I go to the different newspapers,

58
00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:28.435
and I was on the BBC
and they had this headline, um,


59
00:03:28.518 --> 00:03:33.481
"Pan-African comic book company
wants to kick Disney's…" you-know.


60
00:03:33.565 --> 00:03:36.067
So I was like, "This looks fun."

61
00:03:36.151 --> 00:03:39.738
<i>I think that there is a sort</i>
<i>of cultural revolution at the moment.</i>


62
00:03:39.821 --> 00:03:43.992
<i>People are hungry for content</i>
<i>from other sources.</i>


63
00:03:44.075 --> 00:03:45.326
<i>There's an opportunity for them…</i>

64
00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:46.411
It was a video,

65
00:03:46.494 --> 00:03:49.164
and so I got to see the guys,
I got to see their love of comics,


66
00:03:49.247 --> 00:03:53.960
their love of recognizing
all the different artists across Africa


67
00:03:54.043 --> 00:03:56.379
in the different countries,
and their different kinds of stories,


68
00:03:56.463 --> 00:04:00.008
and wanting to make sure the world, um,
saw those stories.


69
00:04:00.091 --> 00:04:03.845
<i>Most of what you find</i>
<i>out there about Africa</i>


70
00:04:03.928 --> 00:04:07.056
<i>is being told by non
-Africans</i>

71
00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:11.019
<i>and it was very important to us</i>
<i>that Africans tell their own stories.</i>


72
00:04:11.102 --> 00:04:14.397
This is incredible. This is exactly
what we do. It's all about storytelling.


73
00:04:14.481 --> 00:04:19.277
Jenn Lee came bursting into
the <i>Frozen II</i> production pod,


74
00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:21.696
and she was, like, "I was list--
I read this interview of this--


75
00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:23.031
Have you heard of this company Kugali?"

76
00:04:23.114 --> 00:04:24.949
and she was just talking,
talking, talking. I was like,


77
00:04:25.033 --> 00:04:26.826
"Slow down. What are you saying?"

78
00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:31.414
And she was like, "I read this interview
with this company, and this one guy said…"


79
00:04:31.498 --> 00:04:34.042
<i>We're gonna kick Disney's a** in Africa.</i>

80
00:04:34.125 --> 00:04:35.251
<i>I know that's gonna happen.</i>

81
00:04:35.335 --> 00:04:38.004
He wasn't saying it as a joke.
He was saying it sincerely.


82
00:04:38.088 --> 00:04:41.341
And it intrigued me so much.
And she said, "What do you think?"


83
00:04:41.424 --> 00:04:43.510
And I said, "Well, I think
we pick up the phone."


84
00:05:14.124 --> 00:05:16.584
- Used to be Kugali's…
- It started with Tolu and I,


85
00:05:16.668 --> 00:05:18.878
who had known each other
since primary school.


86
00:05:18.962 --> 00:05:22.215
We were those kids
who would always watch anime


87
00:05:22.298 --> 00:05:27.429
play video games,
watch superhero content, read comics,


88
00:05:27.512 --> 00:05:30.223
but we're from Nigeria. 
We're Nigerian.

89
00:05:30.306 --> 00:05:33.768
Everything we watch
is American and Japanese.


90
00:05:33.852 --> 00:05:37.439
Where's the Nigerian, um, content?

91
00:05:37.981 --> 00:05:41.943
There was a comic con in Lagos,
here in Freedom Park,


92
00:05:42.026 --> 00:05:46.740
and when I came here and I saw
a small group of creators creating comics


93
00:05:46.823 --> 00:05:51.953
that were inspired by our own culture,
mythology and folklore,


94
00:05:52.036 --> 00:05:53.955
it was a lightbulb moment.
I was like, "Okay!


95
00:05:54.038 --> 00:05:56.875
This is new, this is original,
and here's an opportunity."


96
00:05:56.958 --> 00:05:58.793
<i>Welcome to</i> Kugali Spotlight

97
00:05:58.877 --> 00:06:03.006
<i>where we look at your favorite creators</i>
<i>from across Africa and beyond.</i>


98
00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:07.927
We originally
just started out as a podcast,


99
00:06:08.011 --> 00:06:09.929
so it was just Ziki and I.

100
00:06:10.013 --> 00:06:11.973
We added a blog, a YouTube channel.

101
00:06:12.474 --> 00:06:17.812
I live in Lagos, he doesn't anymore.
He spends way more time in the UK now.


102
00:06:17.896 --> 00:06:24.444
<i>Today I have Gbenle Maverick</i>
<i>and Hafeez Oluwa, the co-creators of</i> Orò<i>…</i>


103
00:06:24.527 --> 00:06:27.322
And then it became clear that

104
00:06:27.405 --> 00:06:32.160
what was needed was a company
that could create a platform


105
00:06:32.243 --> 00:06:36.081
for talented artists and storytellers
to showcase their stories.


106
00:06:36.164 --> 00:06:39.584
So we decided we'd transition
to being a publisher


107
00:06:39.667 --> 00:06:43.213
where we were bringing together
some of these people we had discovered


108
00:06:43.296 --> 00:06:46.382
and putting their work together
with our own work.


109
00:06:50.261 --> 00:06:53.389
You know,
the quality of the work was world-class.


110
00:06:53.473 --> 00:06:56.226
It's good quality by anybody's standards
anywhere in the world.


111
00:06:57.268 --> 00:06:58.853
I was not a big comic book person.

112
00:06:58.937 --> 00:07:02.148
I read the popular comic books,
but I had very bold visions,


113
00:07:02.232 --> 00:07:03.566
there were things I really wanted to do.

114
00:07:03.650 --> 00:07:05.402
In terms of Tolu
and Ziki as a team,

115
00:07:05.485 --> 00:07:08.738
it worked really well for me because, one,
we're all very different personalities,


116
00:07:08.822 --> 00:07:10.573
and we came from
very different backgrounds,


117
00:07:10.657 --> 00:07:11.825
and then from there,

118
00:07:12.909 --> 00:07:14.536
the rest is history.

119
00:07:21.292 --> 00:07:25.046
When Hamid and I first met,
we were both living in London at the time.


120
00:07:25.130 --> 00:07:27.882
He's from Uganda.

121
00:07:27.966 --> 00:07:30.969
I was living with Ziki,
so it was a little co-founders' house.


122
00:07:31.052 --> 00:07:33.221
So, like, right there.

123
00:07:33.304 --> 00:07:36.349
It's that building,
but it's that window down over there.


124
00:07:36.433 --> 00:07:39.686
I think we were sitting
just by the living room.


125
00:07:40.270 --> 00:07:44.607
An executive from Disney Animation
reached out to us.


126
00:07:44.691 --> 00:07:48.069
Just imagine you're sitting there,
young creative, right?


127
00:07:48.153 --> 00:07:51.364
You just called out
the grandaddy of visual entertainment.


128
00:07:51.448 --> 00:07:53.825
You just called them out
and say you're gonna kick their a****.


129
00:07:53.908 --> 00:07:55.702
And then somebody reaches out
saying, "Hi,"


130
00:07:55.785 --> 00:07:57.287
that they're from Disney, "Want to talk?"

131
00:07:57.370 --> 00:07:59.330
First things first,
you don't believe it's them.


132
00:07:59.414 --> 00:08:01.040
You're like, "Pfft, can't be them."

133
00:08:01.124 --> 00:08:06.379
So I was super-skeptical about the--
like, whether or not it was valid.


134
00:08:06.463 --> 00:08:09.841
Then after that we're like, "Let's talk
to them. Let's just see where it goes."


135
00:08:09.924 --> 00:08:13.428
We said perhaps what we'll do
is an anthology of shorts


136
00:08:13.511 --> 00:08:18.141
that are from some of the comics,
and we'll turn them into animation


137
00:08:18.224 --> 00:08:20.351
and that was kind of our idea.

138
00:08:20.435 --> 00:08:23.146
And, of course, they came in
and said, "How about this instead?"


139
00:08:29.819 --> 00:08:33.031
<i>Iwájú</i> is a futuristic
sci-fi story set in Lagos, Nigeria,


140
00:08:33.114 --> 00:08:35.575
about a young girl from the island,

141
00:08:35.658 --> 00:08:38.828
which is the richer
and more affluent part of Lagos,


142
00:08:38.912 --> 00:08:41.581
that befriends a young boy
from the mainland,


143
00:08:41.664 --> 00:08:45.835
which is the poorer and less-developed
part of the city.


144
00:08:47.295 --> 00:08:48.588
But things get complicated

145
00:08:48.671 --> 00:08:53.218
when a crime boss who runs a kidnapping
ring decides to make her his next target.


146
00:08:54.052 --> 00:08:56.805
Ziki really talked about
how he wanted each episode


147
00:08:56.888 --> 00:08:58.056
to focus on a different character

148
00:08:58.139 --> 00:08:59.099
at the very beginning.

149
00:08:59.182 --> 00:09:02.185
Olabode, why did you take that money?

150
00:09:02.268 --> 00:09:03.395
Why?

151
00:09:03.478 --> 00:09:04.979
I just loved it.

152
00:09:05.063 --> 00:09:09.442
It's me, Omotola Abike Martins.

153
00:09:10.443 --> 00:09:13.863
Tola is this
aspirational young lady


154
00:09:13.947 --> 00:09:17.575
who refuses to accept the world
for the way it is and, rather,


155
00:09:17.659 --> 00:09:20.787
wants to see it
for how it should be.

156
00:09:20.870 --> 00:09:24.416
And she ultimately inspires
the people around her.


157
00:09:26.459 --> 00:09:27.502
Let's see if that did it.

158
00:09:27.585 --> 00:09:30.130
Tunde is Tola's father.

159
00:09:30.213 --> 00:09:35.176
He is a wealthy tech executive.

160
00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:41.182
Tunde's arc in the story is a journey
of remembering where he came from.


161
00:09:42.308 --> 00:09:45.478
My people. I am here for you?

162
00:09:45.562 --> 00:09:51.109
Bode grew up
in relatively poor circumstances


163
00:09:51.192 --> 00:09:55.238
and so he developed a sort of
Robin Hood complex,


164
00:09:55.321 --> 00:09:59.534
but it's somewhat false because,
you know, he just takes from the rich and


165
00:09:59.617 --> 00:10:01.494
that's the end of the story.

166
00:10:04.789 --> 00:10:06.166
Kole!

167
00:10:06.750 --> 00:10:08.334
Madam.

168
00:10:08.418 --> 00:10:11.129
Kole is Tola's best friend

169
00:10:11.212 --> 00:10:16.468
and he's also born
in relatively poor circumstances


170
00:10:16.551 --> 00:10:19.763
where you're earning such little money

171
00:10:19.846 --> 00:10:24.100
that it actually ends up pushing you
further and further into poverty.


172
00:10:24.184 --> 00:10:27.729
And so he's ultimately backed
into a corner.


173
00:10:28.813 --> 00:10:31.441
It really looked like
a powerful series.


174
00:10:31.524 --> 00:10:34.652
Long-form series. It is 20--
you know, 20-minute episodes.


175
00:10:34.736 --> 00:10:36.946
We had never done anything
like that before.


176
00:10:37.030 --> 00:10:40.033
Disney Animation as a studio
has done features,


177
00:10:40.116 --> 00:10:41.409
and has done short films,

178
00:10:41.493 --> 00:10:43.745
but we haven't actually done series here.

179
00:10:43.828 --> 00:10:47.791
It just felt like, for all of us,
it would give us something really new


180
00:10:47.874 --> 00:10:49.292
to build together.

181
00:10:49.793 --> 00:10:52.837
You know, Disney Animation has
never partnered with an outside company


182
00:10:52.921 --> 00:10:57.634
in its 100 years of filmmaking,
and so this is absolutely groundbreaking.


183
00:10:58.218 --> 00:11:03.598
Kugali, a full-on production
of this scale


184
00:11:03.681 --> 00:11:08.853
was, quite frankly, something
that was a little bit out of our depth.


185
00:11:08.937 --> 00:11:13.608
And is our creativity
going to be swallowed by this behemoth?


186
00:11:14.275 --> 00:11:17.946
But I think it's important
to take a leap of faith.


187
00:11:18.029 --> 00:11:22.367
Walt Disney himself believed
in taking risks, innovating all the time,


188
00:11:22.450 --> 00:11:25.286
and so I don't
think that for a second

189
00:11:25.370 --> 00:11:27.872
we said we can't take this risk,
or shouldn't.


190
00:11:27.956 --> 00:11:32.168
I have secretly dubbed this project,
"the virgin suicides".


191
00:11:32.252 --> 00:11:36.464
'Cause that's what it is!
'Cause it's like everybody's first time.


192
00:11:36.548 --> 00:11:38.258
Everyone is a first-time leader,

193
00:11:38.341 --> 00:11:41.261
and everyone wants
to put their best foot forward.


194
00:11:41.344 --> 00:11:43.221
Everyone's leaning on each other
to amplify.


195
00:11:43.304 --> 00:11:45.265
You were hired for a reason,
I was hired for a reason.


196
00:11:45.348 --> 00:11:47.142
We all know what we're doing individually

197
00:11:47.225 --> 00:11:48.935
so how do we bring that collectively?

198
00:11:49.018 --> 00:11:51.396
This is either gonna end really well

199
00:11:51.479 --> 00:11:54.816
or it's gonna end really badly.
Let's start by saying that, right?


200
00:11:54.899 --> 00:11:56.693
Let's see what happens!

201
00:11:56.776 --> 00:11:59.779
He'll like all of this, right?

202
00:12:11.166 --> 00:12:13.168
One of the things
I've always wanted to do,


203
00:12:13.251 --> 00:12:15.462
particularly living here in the UK,

204
00:12:15.545 --> 00:12:21.384
is to try to give people
a more accurate understanding


205
00:12:21.468 --> 00:12:25.013
of what life is like back home.

206
00:12:25.096 --> 00:12:31.519
<i>Iwájú</i> is a love letter to Lagos,
but there's a degree of imposter syndrome.


207
00:12:31.603 --> 00:12:36.316
This is my first time as a screenwriter,
as a director.


208
00:12:37.358 --> 00:12:41.821
What if, you know, I don't do a good job.
What if I fail?


209
00:12:46.076 --> 00:12:49.287
My father was an entrepreneur.

210
00:12:49.370 --> 00:12:54.751
You know, he started a bank
in Nigeria in the '90s.


211
00:12:54.834 --> 00:12:57.295
And a lot of his achievements
have been met


212
00:12:57.378 --> 00:12:59.756
with a lot of praise and critical acclaim.

213
00:12:59.839 --> 00:13:03.093
You know, in many respects,
he's always been my hero.


214
00:13:03.176 --> 00:13:07.013
He's always been the person
I've wanted to be most like.


215
00:13:07.097 --> 00:13:09.349
Um, you know, it hasn't been all smooth.

216
00:13:09.432 --> 00:13:12.811
There's definitely been
a lot of emotional conflict.


217
00:13:13.728 --> 00:13:15.730
Do you like living in this house,

218
00:13:15.814 --> 00:13:16.689
eating this food

219
00:13:16.773 --> 00:13:19.692
And wearing nice clothes?

220
00:13:21.069 --> 00:13:24.280
Omotola Martins, 
I am speaking to you.

221
00:13:26.908 --> 00:13:27.909
Good.

222
00:13:28.660 --> 00:13:31.246
Because mediocrity is not an option.

223
00:13:37.627 --> 00:13:42.674
There are many elements of my dad
in Tunde in the sense of his philosophy


224
00:13:42.757 --> 00:13:48.221
which is you need to be able
to stand on your own two feet


225
00:13:48.304 --> 00:13:52.684
and provide for yourself.
That's the most important thing.


226
00:13:56.938 --> 00:14:03.278
And the price for that is to work
extremely hard and to be very focused.


227
00:14:05.697 --> 00:14:08.283
When that's drilled into you,
you know, constantly


228
00:14:08.366 --> 00:14:11.327
and you're just a little child
trying to, sort of, play around


229
00:14:11.411 --> 00:14:14.956
and it's like,
"No. Discipline. Fortitude."


230
00:14:15.039 --> 00:14:18.001
There's almost a sort of, like,
militaristic component.


231
00:14:18.084 --> 00:14:23.047
My father's constant attempts to instill
the value of discipline upon me


232
00:14:23.131 --> 00:14:28.344
is what allowed me to thrive
doing martial arts.


233
00:14:29.053 --> 00:14:33.141
It just really resonated with me
because that was already a philosophy


234
00:14:33.224 --> 00:14:36.561
that had been baked into me
from a very young age.


235
00:14:41.107 --> 00:14:43.151
But on a deeper level,

236
00:14:43.234 --> 00:14:46.279
martial arts is just another
form of artistry and creative expression.


237
00:14:46.362 --> 00:14:51.034
There's something about
being able to move and expel force


238
00:14:51.117 --> 00:14:53.745
really helps me to face my creativity

239
00:14:53.828 --> 00:14:57.248
with as much enthusiasm and passion
as I can muster.


240
00:15:07.008 --> 00:15:10.637
Think what always helps in--
especially for the team all the time,


241
00:15:10.720 --> 00:15:12.889
and we kind of say it's like,
"what's the true north?" Which is…


242
00:15:12.972 --> 00:15:15.308
Working with Jenn Lee,

243
00:15:15.391 --> 00:15:18.812
I have an opportunity to watch
a master in action.


244
00:15:18.895 --> 00:15:22.941
I used to play a lot of video games
when I was younger


245
00:15:23.024 --> 00:15:28.238
and in video games, in a lot of them, you
have a character that kind of levels up


246
00:15:28.321 --> 00:15:30.615
and you gain what's called EXP points,

247
00:15:30.698 --> 00:15:34.702
so working with Jenn Lee has been--
has given me a lot of EXP points


248
00:15:34.786 --> 00:15:36.913
that I probably otherwise
wouldn't have gotten.


249
00:15:37.622 --> 00:15:42.502
So, I mean, I think the most important
things, for me and the story thematically,


250
00:15:43.002 --> 00:15:47.799
is, or are, exploring income inequality…

251
00:15:47.882 --> 00:15:50.552
As a writer and a director,
he has vision.


252
00:15:50.635 --> 00:15:53.555
He knows character, he knows emotion.

253
00:15:54.139 --> 00:15:58.560
He comes with storytelling talent
that's very deep but also very original


254
00:15:58.643 --> 00:16:00.979
and that's another thing
that I think is critical.


255
00:16:02.397 --> 00:16:04.691
That there's a point of view
that stands out.


256
00:16:04.774 --> 00:16:07.152
That's incredible, so I mean, 
I literally…

257
00:16:07.777 --> 00:16:13.658
So it's like if someone
with her credentials is saying it's good,


258
00:16:13.742 --> 00:16:17.704
then maybe some of my self-doubt
is actually just me being


259
00:16:17.787 --> 00:16:19.706
a little too self-indulgent.

260
00:16:19.789 --> 00:16:24.169
I feel like in my career,
um, folks took risks on me.


261
00:16:24.252 --> 00:16:27.255
Bob Iger included,
when he gave me this position


262
00:16:27.338 --> 00:16:30.550
and we've had multiple conversations
about that responsibility.


263
00:16:30.633 --> 00:16:34.429
When you see talent, you have
a responsibility to nurture it.


264
00:16:34.512 --> 00:16:38.725
You have a responsibility
to give folks opportunities


265
00:16:38.808 --> 00:16:44.272
to push them into a place where
they get to grow and learn their craft.


266
00:16:45.648 --> 00:16:48.777
My role in <i>Iwájú</i> is one of
the creators and the production designer.


267
00:16:48.860 --> 00:16:52.322
I'm in charge of all the visuals coming
from the show, and the world-building.


268
00:16:52.405 --> 00:16:56.076
When I say "world,"
I mean every single thing.


269
00:16:56.159 --> 00:16:58.286
So I mean the plants
that are gonna be there,


270
00:16:58.369 --> 00:17:00.789
what kind of building it is,
the architectural type,


271
00:17:00.872 --> 00:17:02.040
what they use to build.

272
00:17:02.123 --> 00:17:05.710
How the people dress, how the people look.
The different skin tones.


273
00:17:08.546 --> 00:17:10.048
I don't live in Lagos, right?

274
00:17:10.131 --> 00:17:14.427
Although Uganda and Lagos have a lot of
similarities in the way we look at things,


275
00:17:14.511 --> 00:17:17.013
so that tends to help my vision
a little bit as well.


276
00:17:17.972 --> 00:17:21.893
It's also making sure you present it
in a very interesting way


277
00:17:21.976 --> 00:17:24.104
that will kind of stick to people's minds.

278
00:17:29.317 --> 00:17:31.736
- Hello!
- Hello.


279
00:17:31.820 --> 00:17:34.239
- Mom has been living in the UK.
- How are you?


280
00:17:34.322 --> 00:17:36.866
- Fine, thank you. How are you?
- I'm all right, thank you.


281
00:17:36.950 --> 00:17:37.784
How have you been?

282
00:17:37.867 --> 00:17:41.371
I grew up with my grandma looking after
us. Grandma, big, big family home.


283
00:17:41.454 --> 00:17:43.790
Whole bunch of aunties and uncles
looking after us.


284
00:17:44.416 --> 00:17:46.000
I moved to the UK in 2011

285
00:17:46.084 --> 00:17:50.672
because I was just about to turn 18
and the visa I got was a child visa.


286
00:17:51.297 --> 00:17:58.179
So I got about two weeks' notice
that I'm gonna move from Uganda to London.


287
00:18:00.932 --> 00:18:03.351
I remember the day his visa was through.

288
00:18:04.018 --> 00:18:07.397
When I rang him and told him,
he was really happy.


289
00:18:07.480 --> 00:18:11.484
It was such a big relief for me
'cause I was really missing him.


290
00:18:11.568 --> 00:18:15.071
As a mother, you do want, of course,
all your children to be with you.


291
00:18:15.905 --> 00:18:18.908
He came in, we settled in well.

292
00:18:18.992 --> 00:18:23.163
We were really happy and comfortable,
although we were a bit squeezed.


293
00:18:23.246 --> 00:18:25.206
I didn't even think we're poor,
that's the funny thing.


294
00:18:25.290 --> 00:18:27.333
But in my head, I was like,
"we're fine. We got food.


295
00:18:27.417 --> 00:18:28.460
We're happy. We're laughing."

296
00:18:28.543 --> 00:18:30.128
To me it felt like we were fine.

297
00:18:30.211 --> 00:18:33.965
The first thing was look for a college
for him to go to.


298
00:18:34.048 --> 00:18:36.634
So I told him, "Let's go
to a STEM college."


299
00:18:36.718 --> 00:18:41.514
When we went there, he had all his
certificates and all his other drawings.


300
00:18:41.598 --> 00:18:44.809
The teacher was asking,
"What would you like to study?"


301
00:18:44.893 --> 00:18:50.732
So, I said, "I think he would like
to do some engineering or some, you know,"


302
00:18:51.232 --> 00:18:54.402
but they said, "No, stop.
I'm asking Hamid.


303
00:18:54.486 --> 00:18:56.571
It's him who should tell me
what he wants."


304
00:18:57.614 --> 00:19:02.744
When Hamid was about six years old,
whenever I would be cleaning the house


305
00:19:02.827 --> 00:19:05.288
I would find some small little books.

306
00:19:05.371 --> 00:19:07.415
And there are some drawings in them.

307
00:19:07.499 --> 00:19:08.583
I would throw them away.

308
00:19:08.666 --> 00:19:12.128
"You always cutting your books and making
some drawings here. What are you drawing?"


309
00:19:12.670 --> 00:19:16.549
Because in my head, as an African mam,

310
00:19:16.633 --> 00:19:19.636
the drawing or doing art is nothing.

311
00:19:19.719 --> 00:19:24.015
He should study how to become a doctor,
engineer, you know, those other things.


312
00:19:24.599 --> 00:19:27.227
I was so surprised
and he was really happy

313
00:19:27.310 --> 00:19:29.354
because he chose
what he really wanted to do.


314
00:19:29.437 --> 00:19:32.607
And that's what made him to be
where he is now.


315
00:19:32.690 --> 00:19:37.529
I'm very proud of him.
I'm happy for him to be where he is.


316
00:19:51.042 --> 00:19:55.755
On <i>Iwájú</i>, I'm a creator
and the cultural consultant.


317
00:19:57.382 --> 00:20:00.009
There are certain things
that if we don't get right,


318
00:20:00.093 --> 00:20:03.263
or if it's not
100% accurate to real life,

319
00:20:03.346 --> 00:20:06.349
people are going to come for me
in particular,


320
00:20:06.433 --> 00:20:09.227
because they're like,
"Tolu, you had one job."


321
00:20:11.312 --> 00:20:16.818
I'd never had dreams of going
into animation or working with Disney.


322
00:20:16.901 --> 00:20:19.738
I had dreams of making video games.

323
00:20:19.821 --> 00:20:21.156
I love games.

324
00:20:21.239 --> 00:20:24.784
I love <i>The Legend of Zelda</i>,
<i>Super Smash Bros</i>.


325
00:20:24.868 --> 00:20:26.536
I love <i>Metal Gear Solid</i>.

326
00:20:27.203 --> 00:20:29.831
I love playing these things.

327
00:20:30.749 --> 00:20:34.377
I've ended up doing even more
than what I intended


328
00:20:34.461 --> 00:20:37.672
because now I'm-- I've done comics,
I've done animation.


329
00:20:37.756 --> 00:20:39.507
I'm still going to do games.

330
00:20:43.303 --> 00:20:50.226
So my dad is a very traditional person
in certain areas


331
00:20:50.310 --> 00:20:54.439
but he's also very individualistic.

332
00:20:54.522 --> 00:20:57.650
He doesn't, you know, follow the crowd.

333
00:20:59.736 --> 00:21:01.529
Whoo!

334
00:21:01.613 --> 00:21:02.614
Tolu.

335
00:21:03.531 --> 00:21:06.367
What Tolu was like a boy, well,

336
00:21:06.451 --> 00:21:12.457
he was very curious.
He studied everything.


337
00:21:12.540 --> 00:21:17.128
Whatever he had a passion for,
I gave him some support there.


338
00:21:17.212 --> 00:21:20.673
He's okay with me
doing certain things


339
00:21:20.757 --> 00:21:25.261
that I know that many other
Yoruba parents would just not allow.


340
00:21:25.345 --> 00:21:29.474
It is a very Nigerian thing.
You had to have very good education.


341
00:21:29.557 --> 00:21:33.061
This is the engineer, you know.
This is the doctor.


342
00:21:33.144 --> 00:21:37.774
You know, this is the chartered
accountant. This is the professor.


343
00:21:37.857 --> 00:21:40.402
You know, that's Nigerian mentality.

344
00:21:40.485 --> 00:21:42.195
He wanted me
to be able to just, you know,


345
00:21:42.278 --> 00:21:44.447
get an engineering job or something.

346
00:21:44.531 --> 00:21:49.119
But he still supported me
when I was chasing my dream.


347
00:21:49.202 --> 00:21:50.328
He didn't stop me.

348
00:21:52.997 --> 00:21:55.708
And I learned from my father

349
00:21:55.792 --> 00:21:59.504
not to force children to do things.

350
00:22:00.213 --> 00:22:04.134
I also thought it was a great idea.
I also thought he had the talent.


351
00:22:04.217 --> 00:22:05.718
And so I said, "Let's see."

352
00:22:09.597 --> 00:22:11.057
- Game.
- Yeah.


353
00:22:17.439 --> 00:22:20.984
Africa has some of the best stories,
some of the most diverse stories.


354
00:22:21.067 --> 00:22:23.027
So many cultures with so many of us.

355
00:22:23.111 --> 00:22:24.738
It's the birthplace of humanity.

356
00:22:29.200 --> 00:22:35.039
There is just this expectation people have
of the media coming out of Nigeria,


357
00:22:35.123 --> 00:22:37.000
coming out of Africa,

358
00:22:37.083 --> 00:22:42.380
and right from when we started Kugali,
one of our goals was to break that.


359
00:22:42.464 --> 00:22:48.219
You know, as Kugali, we are-- we're
inherently innovative in our approach.


360
00:22:48.303 --> 00:22:53.558
That audacity to really approach
storytelling on our own terms


361
00:22:53.641 --> 00:22:55.226
and in our own way,

362
00:22:55.310 --> 00:22:58.480
I think is going to make
this project quite different.


363
00:22:59.105 --> 00:23:01.649
There's this thing
they say in Nigeria,


364
00:23:01.733 --> 00:23:04.152
"You tried, sha." Or, "They tried, sha."

365
00:23:04.235 --> 00:23:09.783
"Sha" is kind of like, um,
"Well, it's not so bad. It's okay."


366
00:23:10.700 --> 00:23:14.412
Nobody's going to look at my work
and say, "They tried, sha."


367
00:23:18.500 --> 00:23:21.586
My role as a producer on the show
is very much like curling.


368
00:23:25.423 --> 00:23:29.469
You're furiously, furiously sweeping
against the stone to carve a path


369
00:23:29.552 --> 00:23:31.054
but you can't actually touch the stone.

370
00:23:31.137 --> 00:23:34.516
So, similar to how
I can't write the dialogue,


371
00:23:34.599 --> 00:23:37.727
I can't animate the characters
and I can't light the scenes.


372
00:23:37.811 --> 00:23:42.148
But it's effectively doing as much as
you can around the actual creative entity


373
00:23:42.232 --> 00:23:45.485
without being able to do
the actual creative work yourself.


374
00:23:51.282 --> 00:23:53.576
<i>The biggest thing right now</i>
<i>is just gonna be the choreography.</i>


375
00:23:53.660 --> 00:23:58.832
I've always been interested in films,
whether it be feature films, or television


376
00:23:58.915 --> 00:24:00.250
and even any type of storytelling.

377
00:24:00.917 --> 00:24:04.170
I lucked out
and started on the finance side


378
00:24:04.254 --> 00:24:07.924
from <i>Big Hero Six</i> to Moana,
then to <i>Frozen II</i>.


379
00:24:08.007 --> 00:24:10.385
And then this fantastic opportunity
came up


380
00:24:10.468 --> 00:24:12.220
and there was no way
I could turn it down,

381
00:24:12.303 --> 00:24:14.222
- <i>Take care. Talk to you later. Bye.</i>
- <i>Ciao.</i>


382
00:24:16.182 --> 00:24:19.269
We have artists in Africa,
we're working with people in Montreal


383
00:24:19.352 --> 00:24:22.981
and in London and in Paris
and in Los Angeles.


384
00:24:24.315 --> 00:24:25.817
It's definitely not normal.

385
00:24:36.327 --> 00:24:38.455
Outside of the Zoom box
and everything!


386
00:24:38.538 --> 00:24:39.372
I know, right?

387
00:24:39.456 --> 00:24:40.874
- My goodness.
- How are you doing?


388
00:24:40.957 --> 00:24:42.834
- So good to see you.
- Really good to see you too.


389
00:24:42.917 --> 00:24:44.753
- Good.
- Yeah. It's crazy. It's crazy.


390
00:24:44.836 --> 00:24:46.045
I can't even believe it.

391
00:24:46.129 --> 00:24:50.049
So we've been working
a little over six months together


392
00:24:50.133 --> 00:24:52.218
on Zoom before we actually met in person.

393
00:24:52.302 --> 00:24:54.888
- How are you doing?
- My goodness.


394
00:24:54.971 --> 00:24:57.682
Ziki in the flesh. 
Can we do a hug?

395
00:24:58.266 --> 00:25:00.477
It's good to see you.
It's good to meet you.


396
00:25:00.560 --> 00:25:01.644
Yeah, it's good to meet you too.

397
00:25:01.728 --> 00:25:04.189
I think for us,
the biggest struggle's always time.


398
00:25:04.272 --> 00:25:07.150
It's the time zones,
it's everyone being separated.


399
00:25:07.233 --> 00:25:09.069
Everyone's coming
from not only a different time zone,


400
00:25:09.152 --> 00:25:11.529
but a different location
and different mind-set.


401
00:25:11.613 --> 00:25:14.407
And we're still trying to maintain
that level of quality


402
00:25:14.491 --> 00:25:15.950
at filmmaking and storytelling.

403
00:25:18.328 --> 00:25:22.540
Of everyone in the team,
Tolu has the closest ties to Lagos.


404
00:25:22.624 --> 00:25:26.711
He was born there, he's grown up there
and continues to live there today.


405
00:25:26.795 --> 00:25:29.923
So he really provided insights

406
00:25:30.006 --> 00:25:35.512
as to how to make the show
as culturally accurate as possible.


407
00:25:35.595 --> 00:25:41.935
As the cultural consultant,
I am saying this thing is very Lagos.


408
00:25:42.018 --> 00:25:43.603
This way of doing things.

409
00:25:43.686 --> 00:25:48.191
This is so Lagos and I want it to be in
the story, like, it has to come through.


410
00:25:48.274 --> 00:25:51.569
<i>Let's get right into</i>
<i>whatever questions are ready…</i>


411
00:25:51.653 --> 00:25:54.948
One of the ways
that he's doing this


412
00:25:55.031 --> 00:25:59.494
is by having a weekly segment
called <i>Wetin Dey Happen?</i>


413
00:25:59.577 --> 00:26:04.374
"Wetin dey happen?" just means
"What's happening?" or "What's popping?"


414
00:26:04.457 --> 00:26:05.542
"What's going on?"

415
00:26:05.625 --> 00:26:10.839
It's pidgin. It's pidgin English,
which is spoken widely in Lagos.


416
00:26:10.922 --> 00:26:13.925
Tolu's <i>Wetin Dey Happen</i>
meetings are incredible.


417
00:26:14.008 --> 00:26:18.471
Anyone can ask any question.
He is our eyes into Lagos, Nigeria.


418
00:26:18.555 --> 00:26:24.102
<i>What is different about going to school,</i>
<i>specifically for, like, a ten-year-old</i>


419
00:26:24.185 --> 00:26:26.146
<i>on the island versus the mainland?</i>

420
00:26:26.229 --> 00:26:30.984
It's one of the most fun sessions.
It's very unstructured.


421
00:26:31.067 --> 00:26:33.862
It's more like, "What do you guys
want to know?"


422
00:26:33.945 --> 00:26:35.864
And then I tell them wetin dey happen.

423
00:26:35.947 --> 00:26:38.575
<i>Are young people worried</i>
<i>about their outward appear…</i>


424
00:26:38.658 --> 00:26:41.286
<i>Do you see kids, sort of, walking</i>
<i>in like a group to…</i>


425
00:26:41.369 --> 00:26:43.496
<i>…any coming-of-age type traditions?</i>

426
00:26:43.580 --> 00:26:44.706
<i>I was wondering if there is any…</i>

427
00:26:44.789 --> 00:26:49.127
They've asked way more questions
than most people ever bother to ask,


428
00:26:49.210 --> 00:26:50.837
even about their own cultures.

429
00:26:51.337 --> 00:26:54.758
And Tolu eventually started filming
everything that he saw outside of his car


430
00:26:54.841 --> 00:26:56.885
while he was driving around the city.

431
00:26:56.968 --> 00:27:00.013
<i>What you're seeing now</i>
<i>is, like, blocks of flats,</i>


432
00:27:00.096 --> 00:27:03.224
<i>plazas and schools…</i>

433
00:27:03.308 --> 00:27:06.603
This is what kekes really look like,
this is what puff puff looks like.


434
00:27:06.686 --> 00:27:09.064
This is what people in the markets
sound like.


435
00:27:09.147 --> 00:27:11.608
<i>Of course somebody's going</i>
<i>in the wrong direction.</i>


436
00:27:11.691 --> 00:27:12.859
<i>Of course. I mean, why not.</i>

437
00:27:12.942 --> 00:27:14.903
<i>Are we not in Lagos.</i>

438
00:27:14.986 --> 00:27:17.072
Here's what a gatesman's house looks like.

439
00:27:17.155 --> 00:27:21.659
<i>This is the gatesman's</i>
<i>house. Always right next to the gate.</i>


440
00:27:21.743 --> 00:27:24.329
He's like, literally, like,
boots on the ground.


441
00:27:24.412 --> 00:27:26.831
This is not us making up a world.

442
00:27:26.915 --> 00:27:31.753
This is us doing our best
to portray a very real world


443
00:27:31.836 --> 00:27:34.923
and we wanna get
every single detail right.


444
00:27:35.590 --> 00:27:37.675
You know,
the little things like


445
00:27:37.759 --> 00:27:42.472
the biggest mall in the world is in
Nigeria. It's in the streets of Lagos.


446
00:27:42.555 --> 00:27:44.516
It's the traffic in Lagos.

447
00:27:44.599 --> 00:27:45.975
Phone charger!

448
00:27:46.059 --> 00:27:46.893
Come here, yes.

449
00:27:47.477 --> 00:27:48.353
'Ey!

450
00:27:48.436 --> 00:27:50.063
People
sell things in traffic.


451
00:27:50.146 --> 00:27:53.733
Look at you smiling, you know! You know
you're giving me a high price!


452
00:27:53.817 --> 00:27:56.236
Pay? For a lizard?

453
00:27:56.319 --> 00:28:01.616
Those type of little details, those are
the things I'm trying to put out there.


454
00:28:01.699 --> 00:28:05.787
I want people to see the good, the bad,
the ugly, you know. All the quirks.


455
00:28:06.413 --> 00:28:08.748
The particular scene
I'm working on now,


456
00:28:08.832 --> 00:28:14.796
Tola and Kole visit the market place
for the first time.


457
00:28:14.879 --> 00:28:21.803
As a story artist, trying to bring that
authenticity to a project about Nigeria,


458
00:28:21.886 --> 00:28:26.850
somewhere I've never been,
Tolu has been really helpful with that.


459
00:28:26.933 --> 00:28:30.228
Tolu's input is absolutely vital.

460
00:28:30.311 --> 00:28:33.481
I think you remove that,
<i>Iwájú</i> would not be <i>Iwájú.</i>


461
00:28:34.107 --> 00:28:36.651
<i>And there's more art</i>
<i>that's gonna be coming for it as well</i>


462
00:28:36.735 --> 00:28:38.820
<i>that we'll be sure to pass along</i>
<i>to the story team.</i>


463
00:28:38.903 --> 00:28:44.617
With animation, you are part of a
humongous creative collaboration team.


464
00:28:44.701 --> 00:28:46.202
And that is fantastic.

465
00:28:46.786 --> 00:28:47.704
At some point,

466
00:28:47.787 --> 00:28:50.540
these contributions
that the animators are making,


467
00:28:50.623 --> 00:28:54.043
the layout artists are making,
they all end up in the cutting room.


468
00:28:55.170 --> 00:28:57.672
I am the lead editor on <i>Iwájú</i>,

469
00:28:57.756 --> 00:29:01.718
helping the director create the story
in the cutting room.


470
00:29:02.844 --> 00:29:03.678
- Hi.
- Hi, Ziki.


471
00:29:03.762 --> 00:29:05.096
- How's it going?
- Good.


472
00:29:05.180 --> 00:29:06.181
- Hello.
- Hey, hi.


473
00:29:06.264 --> 00:29:07.974
Working with her, 
I've learned a lot.

474
00:29:08.057 --> 00:29:12.062
I find it really easy
to relate with her as well.


475
00:29:12.645 --> 00:29:14.689
Yeah, if we went basically from "-"

476
00:29:14.773 --> 00:29:17.692
and lost all this
table-flying-around business.


477
00:29:18.902 --> 00:29:22.614
And then this would all work.
Then he could fling him across the room.


478
00:29:23.198 --> 00:29:25.408
Yeah. I think if we just
get rid of the table


479
00:29:25.492 --> 00:29:28.745
and, you know, all the other tantrums,
this might work.


480
00:29:28.828 --> 00:29:32.165
So Ziki is rather stoic character.

481
00:29:32.248 --> 00:29:35.960
He will absorb everything
and he thinks about it.


482
00:29:36.044 --> 00:29:39.214
Maybe when he's on the phone,
he's like scanning the room


483
00:29:39.297 --> 00:29:41.091
and then he has his eyes on Sunday.

484
00:29:41.966 --> 00:29:45.553
And then it's a much more narrow focus.

485
00:29:46.137 --> 00:29:48.765
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
I think that's a good idea.


486
00:29:48.848 --> 00:29:51.309
It's the safest place,
I think, on the show.


487
00:29:51.392 --> 00:29:53.561
We can try anything, do anything.

488
00:29:53.645 --> 00:29:55.480
This just-
- It's such a…

489
00:29:55.563 --> 00:29:58.650
Laugh, joke, whatever.
And I try and cultivate that


490
00:29:58.733 --> 00:29:59.901
as much as possible.

491
00:30:01.361 --> 00:30:02.779
What's up, Ziki. How are you?

492
00:30:02.862 --> 00:30:04.781
- <i>Yeah, I'm good. How are you doing?</i>
- I'm all right. I've…


493
00:30:04.864 --> 00:30:08.326
Working with Halima
has been interesting.


494
00:30:08.410 --> 00:30:13.581
I've never really worked
with anyone as a co-writer.


495
00:30:13.665 --> 00:30:17.585
<i>As far as, like, a structure,</i>
<i>I think it makes sense.</i>


496
00:30:17.669 --> 00:30:20.880
She's been essential
because it's a lot of responsibility,


497
00:30:20.964 --> 00:30:24.217
carrying both the directorial
and writing responsibilities,


498
00:30:24.300 --> 00:30:27.679
so I think she's taking
a huge load off of my shoulders.


499
00:30:27.762 --> 00:30:31.516
<i>What I did is I put</i>
<i>some options of what Dami said…</i>


500
00:30:31.599 --> 00:30:34.686
He's been really great
about making himself available


501
00:30:34.769 --> 00:30:36.396
to answer any questions

502
00:30:36.479 --> 00:30:39.023
and give really thoughtful notes on pages

503
00:30:39.107 --> 00:30:43.903
explaining why from a cultural lens,
it would need to be a certain way.


504
00:30:43.987 --> 00:30:46.531
<i>All right, all right, I've got</i>
<i>your back. We'll get through it.</i>


505
00:30:46.614 --> 00:30:47.741
Thank you.

506
00:30:48.491 --> 00:30:50.910
I have known Halima's writing
for a long time


507
00:30:50.994 --> 00:30:54.873
and she's a phenomenal writer,
especially with character.


508
00:30:54.956 --> 00:30:57.167
- This is my Shakespeare pen…
- Your Shakespeare pen?


509
00:30:57.250 --> 00:31:02.380
Jenn and I began at the studio
at the same time, and on the same project.


510
00:31:02.464 --> 00:31:03.798
She was writing for <i>Wreck
-It Ralph</i>.

511
00:31:03.882 --> 00:31:05.633
I was the production secretary
for <i>Wreck-It Ralph</i>.


512
00:31:05.717 --> 00:31:07.677
So I told her
I was a writer and,

513
00:31:07.761 --> 00:31:10.764
you know, we just kinda started
a relationship like that.


514
00:31:10.847 --> 00:31:14.517
Okay. I love what you're going for.
Here's the thing. I love…


515
00:31:15.018 --> 00:31:17.020
You know, I always
was checking in with her, like,


516
00:31:17.103 --> 00:31:19.064
"I'm writing this,
can you read it? What do you think?"


517
00:31:19.147 --> 00:31:21.691
And she would give notes on scripts
that I was writing, give advice.


518
00:31:22.275 --> 00:31:23.359
I have a couple suggestions…

519
00:31:24.486 --> 00:31:25.987
…just of some stuff. Don't sigh.

520
00:31:26.988 --> 00:31:30.116
You heard that?
I thought that was an internal…


521
00:31:30.825 --> 00:31:34.871
On Zoom, the sighs are more subtle,
but not in person.


522
00:31:36.206 --> 00:31:39.334
This is all happening in real time
and so it's just like,


523
00:31:39.417 --> 00:31:42.587
"Okay, we're gonna try this and
if it doesn't work, we're gonna pivot."


524
00:31:42.670 --> 00:31:46.424
You know what I mean, and I think
it's just been learning as we go.


525
00:31:46.508 --> 00:31:50.637
And that's been stressful.
And fun. But stressful.


526
00:31:51.179 --> 00:31:53.765
And fun.

527
00:31:59.604 --> 00:32:02.732
Nigeria has
over 300 languages


528
00:32:02.816 --> 00:32:07.445
but the major language is Yoruba.
Igbo. Hausa.


529
00:32:08.321 --> 00:32:11.366
Lagos just happens to be a Yoruba state.

530
00:32:12.867 --> 00:32:17.205
When we wanted to name the show, just like
when we wanted to name our company,


531
00:32:17.288 --> 00:32:20.250
we wanted a name
that would be easy to pronounce.


532
00:32:20.333 --> 00:32:23.711
Ziki wanted the title
to reflect the future.


533
00:32:24.295 --> 00:32:27.090
"Future" in Yoruba would be <i>Ojo Iwájú</i>

534
00:32:27.173 --> 00:32:30.885
which translates to, "The day in front"
or, "The day ahead."


535
00:32:30.969 --> 00:32:34.806
We just took out the <i>Ojo</i>
and called it <i>Iwájú</i>.


536
00:32:34.889 --> 00:32:39.227
This story allows us
to envision a future for Lagos.


537
00:32:39.310 --> 00:32:42.021
To envision a way forward.

538
00:32:42.105 --> 00:32:43.440
Wow!

539
00:32:43.523 --> 00:32:46.693
The average person in Lagos
speaks English,


540
00:32:48.236 --> 00:32:51.114
probably a bit of Yoruba
and then pidgin English.


541
00:32:51.197 --> 00:32:55.410
I no fit go where I dey stay,
and with my oga. Lie lie.


542
00:32:55.493 --> 00:32:59.831
Pidgin English is the one language
that unites the whole of West Africa.


543
00:32:59.914 --> 00:33:00.790
Not just Nigeria.

544
00:33:00.874 --> 00:33:04.419
My madam don turn ten. 
How I go forget?

545
00:33:04.502 --> 00:33:06.880
Almost all of us can speak pidgin English.

546
00:33:06.963 --> 00:33:08.089
There is no way,

547
00:33:08.173 --> 00:33:13.470
no way I am going to let us do a story
in Lagos and they don't speak pidgin.


548
00:33:13.553 --> 00:33:15.138
I get plenty work to do.

549
00:33:15.221 --> 00:33:16.473
I no fit play today.

550
00:33:17.056 --> 00:33:19.392
The language in <i>Iwájú</i> is very intentional

551
00:33:19.476 --> 00:33:22.812
because we want to make sure
that everyone has a Yoruba dialect


552
00:33:22.896 --> 00:33:24.939
and have it be
really true to the people.

553
00:33:25.023 --> 00:33:28.693
So that when Nigerians are watching it
they can feel a level of kinship there.


554
00:33:28.777 --> 00:33:32.447
Even if we get voice actors
who are Nigerian, per se,


555
00:33:32.530 --> 00:33:37.243
if they've spent too much time in the US
or UK, they will not sound Nigerian.


556
00:33:37.327 --> 00:33:41.706
I mean, even Ziki doesn't sound Nigerian.
He sounds British.


557
00:33:41.790 --> 00:33:44.084
The casting process is really fun.

558
00:33:44.167 --> 00:33:49.881
We're working with a freelance
casting director in Lagos,


559
00:33:49.964 --> 00:33:51.299
Lala Akindoju.

560
00:33:51.382 --> 00:33:57.097
The beautiful thing about <i>Iwájú</i>
is that it's very relatable to Nigeria.


561
00:33:57.180 --> 00:34:01.142
So to find a project
that tells a story that is us,


562
00:34:01.226 --> 00:34:03.603
that is authentic to us,
it's such a big deal.


563
00:34:03.686 --> 00:34:08.358
For Nigeria. And for the Nigerian movie
industry, popularly called "Nollywood".


564
00:34:08.441 --> 00:34:11.820
Most of our cast,
I would say, over 90 percent,


565
00:34:11.903 --> 00:34:13.863
is actually based in Lagos, Nigeria.

566
00:34:13.947 --> 00:34:15.490
They are homegrown talents,

567
00:34:15.573 --> 00:34:18.535
grew up here, trained here,
have been working here,


568
00:34:18.618 --> 00:34:21.037
and it feels like it's a time
to announce them.


569
00:34:22.664 --> 00:34:26.000
Now, our lead is a young-- young child.

570
00:34:26.084 --> 00:34:31.965
Tola. Ten years old. Has two friends.
Short. Has big hair.


571
00:34:32.048 --> 00:34:34.634
Goes to a private school.
That's such an important detail.


572
00:34:34.717 --> 00:34:39.639
So I had to reach out
to many schools' drama clubs.


573
00:34:39.722 --> 00:34:42.392
You never know when
you're going to stumble on magic.


574
00:34:42.475 --> 00:34:48.022
And I was very, I don't know, lucky
to have found Simi.


575
00:34:48.106 --> 00:34:50.400
<i>Hello,</i>
<i>my name is Simisola Gbadamosi</i>


576
00:34:50.483 --> 00:34:52.736
<i>and I'm reading the character of Tola.</i>

577
00:34:52.819 --> 00:34:56.114
I was like, "Okay, girl.
Okay, okay, okay!"


578
00:34:56.197 --> 00:34:58.616
I was smiling the entire time.

579
00:34:58.700 --> 00:35:00.869
Tola, you just had to go.

580
00:35:00.952 --> 00:35:03.413
If you had just waited
until Daddy took you…


581
00:35:04.289 --> 00:35:06.458
I'm like, "This is her. 
This is Tola."

582
00:35:06.541 --> 00:35:08.251
"Yes! I won!"

583
00:35:08.334 --> 00:35:11.004
She's pretty much me in animated form.

584
00:35:11.087 --> 00:35:13.006
She's got sass.

585
00:35:13.089 --> 00:35:16.259
Cute, if this was yesterday.

586
00:35:16.342 --> 00:35:18.803
She's also kind of bossy sometimes.

587
00:35:18.887 --> 00:35:21.639
No games. All work.

588
00:35:21.723 --> 00:35:25.060
And it's my birthday, so no arguments.

589
00:35:25.143 --> 00:35:27.604
Simi, it was really fun
working with her.


590
00:35:27.687 --> 00:35:29.022
All right. Let's record.

591
00:35:29.105 --> 00:35:31.524
She takes directions extremely well.

592
00:35:31.608 --> 00:35:34.110
I have never done voice acting before.

593
00:35:34.194 --> 00:35:38.114
When I was three, I played a sheep
in my Christmas play.


594
00:35:38.198 --> 00:35:39.032
All right, Simi.

595
00:35:39.115 --> 00:35:42.660
For the last two reads, just add
a little bit of emphasis on "any".


596
00:35:42.744 --> 00:35:44.037
So, "any."

597
00:35:44.120 --> 00:35:49.167
I don't know why I'm here or what
you need. But I will not be any trouble.


598
00:35:49.250 --> 00:35:51.795
It took us a long time to find Tola
and everybody else,


599
00:35:51.878 --> 00:35:54.339
but it took us
extra time to find Kole.

600
00:35:55.006 --> 00:35:59.344
Casting boys, I find, is more difficult,

601
00:35:59.427 --> 00:36:00.678
especially in Nigeria.

602
00:36:00.762 --> 00:36:04.808
There's just a handful and you don't have
a wide range. I find there are more women.


603
00:36:04.891 --> 00:36:10.313
When you wan give person
big, big things, but life say you no fit?


604
00:36:10.397 --> 00:36:15.819
When Siji came my way, he has a
laid-back kind of voice but it just works,


605
00:36:15.902 --> 00:36:18.905
and then when we place his voice
next to Simi's.


606
00:36:19.697 --> 00:36:20.698
It was perfect.

607
00:36:20.782 --> 00:36:23.743
You should be a lawyer
when you grow up.


608
00:36:23.827 --> 00:36:25.995
Daddy would actually love that.

609
00:36:26.788 --> 00:36:31.668
I see different elements of myself
in all of the characters.


610
00:36:31.751 --> 00:36:36.631
Kole, who has a bit of a
social awkwardness to him,


611
00:36:36.714 --> 00:36:39.175
I can definitely relate to that.

612
00:36:39.259 --> 00:36:41.553
Kole is a complex person.

613
00:36:41.636 --> 00:36:47.809
He is a, kind of, shy individual. But when
he is given the opportunity to shine,


614
00:36:47.892 --> 00:36:51.312
or, kind of, relax with Tola,
he becomes a new person.


615
00:36:51.396 --> 00:36:52.772
Not bad.

616
00:36:53.440 --> 00:36:55.567
But you need to loosen your shoulder.

617
00:36:55.650 --> 00:36:58.820
I definitely see
that part of myself within Kole.


618
00:36:59.487 --> 00:37:03.867
This project, it's a big deal for
the Nigerian industry, for Nollywood.


619
00:37:03.950 --> 00:37:05.326
I'm very proud.

620
00:37:05.410 --> 00:37:08.246
The voices you're going to hear
are homegrown.


621
00:37:08.329 --> 00:37:11.040
I say I'm so honored
to be a part of Nollywood


622
00:37:11.124 --> 00:37:13.835
and I say the world should
look out for Nollywood.


623
00:37:13.918 --> 00:37:15.170
We're coming.

624
00:37:19.883 --> 00:37:21.259
So, for us and the story,

625
00:37:21.342 --> 00:37:23.636
we're always trying to balance
the creative piece


626
00:37:23.720 --> 00:37:25.263
in terms of what's driving
the characters forward,


627
00:37:25.346 --> 00:37:27.515
as well as a cultural authenticity.

628
00:37:27.599 --> 00:37:29.100
And this came up consistently

629
00:37:29.184 --> 00:37:32.604
because as Halima's rewriting,
as she's taking her approach to it,


630
00:37:32.687 --> 00:37:35.648
and then Tolu, our cultural consultant,
will then look at the script


631
00:37:35.732 --> 00:37:38.735
and there are moments
when he does look at scenes


632
00:37:38.818 --> 00:37:42.405
and he, off the bat, will go,
"That doesn't feel Nigerian enough."


633
00:37:42.489 --> 00:37:47.869
I want every part of it to feel Nigerian,
feel like it was created by Nigerians,


634
00:37:47.952 --> 00:37:53.583
and not feel like it's Americans
doing the story


635
00:37:53.666 --> 00:37:55.794
and then just consulting Nigerians
here and there.


636
00:37:55.877 --> 00:37:59.714
To create a story
that is a good story,

637
00:37:59.798 --> 00:38:03.676
that people, no matter where they are,
will resonate with and love,


638
00:38:03.760 --> 00:38:08.431
but is so culturally specific,
and so you wanna keep it accurate,


639
00:38:08.515 --> 00:38:10.558
is not an easy dance.

640
00:38:10.642 --> 00:38:15.563
It is a dance where I am doing the tango,
and you are over here cha-cha sliding.


641
00:38:15.647 --> 00:38:16.689
We're not doing it together.

642
00:38:16.773 --> 00:38:20.402
And so it becomes just like,
what's the battle


643
00:38:20.485 --> 00:38:23.738
and what's the most important thing
that we're trying to say in this moment.


644
00:38:24.322 --> 00:38:27.909
Three, two, one. Record.

645
00:38:28.701 --> 00:38:33.248
<i>Starting at line one.</i>
<i>So you'll be, "Kole abi, Tunde."</i>


646
00:38:33.331 --> 00:38:36.584
"She must be following broda Sunday
to Bode's hideout."


647
00:38:36.668 --> 00:38:38.086
<i>"Have you been there?"</i>

648
00:38:38.169 --> 00:38:41.923
Halima would translate
certain things directly,


649
00:38:42.674 --> 00:38:44.717
the way it would work in America,

650
00:38:44.801 --> 00:38:47.137
and I'll be like,
"This just does not work."


651
00:38:47.220 --> 00:38:51.141
There was a line where I have

652
00:38:51.224 --> 00:38:55.562
Kole gets into the car with Tunde,
and he says,


653
00:38:55.645 --> 00:38:56.980
No, <i>Oga</i>.

654
00:38:57.063 --> 00:38:59.399
<i>Oga</i> means "boss," right.

655
00:38:59.482 --> 00:39:02.193
And so we have Kole calling him that
throughout the whole series.


656
00:39:02.277 --> 00:39:04.112
And Tunde looks at him,

657
00:39:04.195 --> 00:39:07.615
and this is after he's found out
he's been a part of the kidnapping,


658
00:39:07.699 --> 00:39:10.785
and he says, "Don't call me that anymore."

659
00:39:10.869 --> 00:39:13.872
As to say, "I
am not your boss anymore."

660
00:39:13.955 --> 00:39:17.333
And Kole looks down
and he says, "Sorry Sa."


661
00:39:17.417 --> 00:39:18.835
As in, "Sorry, sir."

662
00:39:18.918 --> 00:39:21.171
"Sorry. Sa."

663
00:39:21.254 --> 00:39:22.464
<i>Perfect.</i>

664
00:39:22.547 --> 00:39:24.841
And I'm like,
"That's gonna be a great moment,"


665
00:39:24.924 --> 00:39:27.927
because then later in the wrap-up,
and we're all happy again


666
00:39:28.011 --> 00:39:33.099
and everybody's friends, I had
written it that Kole says, "Thank you Sa,"


667
00:39:33.183 --> 00:39:36.853
and Tunde says, "Don't you mean Oga?"

668
00:39:37.812 --> 00:39:39.939
I thought it was great and then…

669
00:39:40.023 --> 00:39:41.274
…enter Tolu.

670
00:39:41.357 --> 00:39:44.194
The feeling Halima
wanted to pass across there is,


671
00:39:44.277 --> 00:39:46.237
"No. Don't call me that. Not now."

672
00:39:46.321 --> 00:39:51.034
Because Tunde's angry at Kole for being
partly responsible for Tola's kidnapping.


673
00:39:51.117 --> 00:39:55.288
So Halima wanted to portray that.
"No. Don't call me that. Not now."


674
00:39:55.371 --> 00:39:57.791
But I told her, that doesn't track

675
00:39:57.874 --> 00:40:02.670
because Tunde will expect Kole
to call him <i>Oga</i> no matter the situation.


676
00:40:02.754 --> 00:40:04.756
It's not going to be like,
"I'm not happy with you now,

677
00:40:04.839 --> 00:40:06.007
so don't call me <i>Oga</i>."

678
00:40:06.091 --> 00:40:08.218
So I have to push
back and tell her that,

679
00:40:08.301 --> 00:40:12.680
"The emotion you're trying to portray
here, it won't work in Nigeria."


680
00:40:12.764 --> 00:40:15.517
Let me tell you one thing
I want you to be doing.


681
00:40:15.600 --> 00:40:20.188
If you think,
"Na. The houseboy wouldn't say that.


682
00:40:20.271 --> 00:40:21.689
This is the way he would say it,"

683
00:40:21.773 --> 00:40:23.525
you can say it how
it is in the script

684
00:40:23.608 --> 00:40:29.030
and then tell them, "I want to make
a suggestion. I want to do an alt."


685
00:40:29.114 --> 00:40:32.700
Because you know, at the end of the day,
they are Americans.


686
00:40:32.784 --> 00:40:37.497
They don't know how we say certain things
or how we interpret certain things.


687
00:40:37.580 --> 00:40:39.499
You do. You understand it.

688
00:40:39.582 --> 00:40:43.253
Feel free to make
suggestions or corrections.


689
00:40:44.254 --> 00:40:47.173
There has been a few lines
that I've really fought for


690
00:40:47.257 --> 00:40:50.009
but then ultimately it had to be, like,
it doesn't serve the story.


691
00:40:50.093 --> 00:40:51.428
So I have to let it go.

692
00:40:51.511 --> 00:40:55.515
Sometimes authenticity trumps stories.

693
00:40:55.598 --> 00:40:57.267
I have had to learn

694
00:40:57.350 --> 00:41:02.856
for it to not impact it
in such a way that the story suffers.


695
00:41:02.939 --> 00:41:05.859
<i>Great. Perfect. 
Line seven.</i>

696
00:41:05.942 --> 00:41:09.154
- So you want to see the real Lagos?
- Yes.


697
00:41:09.237 --> 00:41:11.865
No wahala.
But you have to do what I say.


698
00:41:11.948 --> 00:41:13.366
Deal.

699
00:41:22.834 --> 00:41:25.044
Ehen. You want my fine cap?

700
00:41:25.128 --> 00:41:29.340
Ajegunle is one
of the major locations in the story.


701
00:41:29.424 --> 00:41:32.886
It's where Tunde is from, it's where
Kole is from, it's where Bode is from


702
00:41:32.969 --> 00:41:39.017
and it is actually a real place
on the mainland in Lagos.


703
00:41:48.401 --> 00:41:53.281
It's got the Boundary Market
which is beautiful in many, many ways.


704
00:41:54.365 --> 00:41:59.829
And it's got the real
authentic Nigerian feel as well.


705
00:41:59.913 --> 00:42:01.498
And it's got the chaos as well,

706
00:42:01.581 --> 00:42:06.961
so it was a great place for Tola
to go on a journey of discovery.


707
00:42:14.719 --> 00:42:18.264
I knew that I wanted the scenes
to take place in a market


708
00:42:18.348 --> 00:42:23.311
and then you just said, "Given
the geography of-- of, what makes sense,


709
00:42:23.395 --> 00:42:26.356
Ajegunle would be a good location
to have everything


710
00:42:26.439 --> 00:42:27.649
and then I was like, "Sure. Why not."

711
00:42:27.732 --> 00:42:29.859
- Really? I did?
- Yeah, you did.


712
00:42:29.943 --> 00:42:31.820
- I see--
- See, I give credit where credit is due.


713
00:42:31.903 --> 00:42:33.988
- I don't even know--
- I was gonna say.


714
00:42:34.072 --> 00:42:37.200
The majority of kidnappings
don't really happen on the island


715
00:42:37.283 --> 00:42:40.703
because the security is a lot more robust.

716
00:42:41.579 --> 00:42:44.499
It had to be a place
that was relatively dangerous


717
00:42:44.582 --> 00:42:46.668
and had a, you know, dangerous reputation.

718
00:42:46.751 --> 00:42:48.336
Go!

719
00:42:48.420 --> 00:42:52.132
So here, you know,
it's a lot easier to get lost


720
00:42:52.215 --> 00:42:55.301
and then to be found by the kidnappers,

721
00:42:55.385 --> 00:42:59.180
so it just made a lot of sense
to stage it in this particular area.


722
00:42:59.264 --> 00:43:01.808
And also, everyone's--
Even though there's people,


723
00:43:01.891 --> 00:43:06.062
everyone's so busy that no one's really
paying attention to what's going on.


724
00:43:06.855 --> 00:43:10.150
Kidnapping is a real issue in Nigeria.

725
00:43:13.945 --> 00:43:18.908
In Falomo Bridge
there are a series of murals


726
00:43:18.992 --> 00:43:23.037
which are dedicated to the Chibok girls,

727
00:43:23.121 --> 00:43:27.041
who are a group of young girls
that were kidnapped


728
00:43:27.125 --> 00:43:31.796
several years ago by a group
known as Boko Haram.


729
00:43:32.380 --> 00:43:37.677
I picked kidnapping because
I thought it would shine a lens


730
00:43:37.761 --> 00:43:41.264
at the whole host of problems
that we don't like.


731
00:43:42.265 --> 00:43:44.517
On the political side of things,

732
00:43:44.601 --> 00:43:49.689
kidnappings are just often used
as a way for rebels or insurgents


733
00:43:49.773 --> 00:43:51.775
or people who call themselves
freedom fighters


734
00:43:51.858 --> 00:43:56.988
to combat what they believe is injustice
on the part of the government.


735
00:44:01.326 --> 00:44:03.536
Omotola Martins,

736
00:44:04.245 --> 00:44:07.916
your daddy has done well for himself.

737
00:44:09.626 --> 00:44:14.047
In <i>Iwájú</i>, the villain Bode believes

738
00:44:14.130 --> 00:44:18.343
that the wealthy have been hoarding
the wealth amongst themselves.


739
00:44:18.426 --> 00:44:23.389
And so he really thinks
that he's owed this money


740
00:44:23.473 --> 00:44:26.267
and it is meant to mirror

741
00:44:26.351 --> 00:44:31.231
what I imagine
a lot of Lagosian criminals are thinking.


742
00:44:32.148 --> 00:44:37.987
It is kind of a dark subject
and, actually,


743
00:44:38.071 --> 00:44:44.119
Disney Animation in particular
are quite good at more mature themes.


744
00:44:44.202 --> 00:44:46.621
Throughout history
in Disney fairy tales,


745
00:44:46.704 --> 00:44:49.124
they put us in great jeopardy
all the time.


746
00:44:50.208 --> 00:44:51.418
And fairy tales are there

747
00:44:51.501 --> 00:44:55.380
for us to learn to cope with situations
in life in a safe space


748
00:44:56.172 --> 00:45:00.635
and so <i>Iwájú</i>, for me, has always
been just like our other films


749
00:45:00.718 --> 00:45:05.056
and for the children in the audience,
we want to make sure they can feel safe


750
00:45:05.140 --> 00:45:07.600
to understand the focus of this story.

751
00:45:07.684 --> 00:45:13.064
So, especially with Tola's character,
in terms of every shot that she's in,


752
00:45:13.148 --> 00:45:17.026
when we're working with the kidnapping,
what kind of energy are we creating?


753
00:45:17.902 --> 00:45:22.615
I think we found ways
of presenting that kind of subject matter


754
00:45:22.699 --> 00:45:25.201
in a manner that isn't too traumatic.

755
00:45:25.285 --> 00:45:27.954
It's part of what we do,

756
00:45:28.037 --> 00:45:32.333
and we can create a discourse together

757
00:45:32.417 --> 00:45:36.379
to talk about these scary things
in life at times.


758
00:45:45.138 --> 00:45:47.599
♪ <i>I've got gizmos and gadgets a-plenty</i> ♪

759
00:45:47.682 --> 00:45:50.060
♪ <i>I've got whozits and whatzits galore</i> ♪

760
00:45:50.143 --> 00:45:54.397
<i>The Little Mermaid</i>, I can sing
many of the songs word for word right now.


761
00:45:54.481 --> 00:45:59.986
♪ <i>Wish I could be
part of that world</i> ♪

762
00:46:00.487 --> 00:46:03.114
When I watch Disney's movies,

763
00:46:03.198 --> 00:46:07.660
I mean, many of them you see, <i>Hercules</i>,
Greek legends, <i>Mulan</i>, China.


764
00:46:07.744 --> 00:46:11.915
They explore so many different cultures
and, to be honest,


765
00:46:11.998 --> 00:46:14.959
as a kid I think my introduction
to many of those cultures


766
00:46:15.043 --> 00:46:16.169
were from Disney movies.

767
00:46:16.252 --> 00:46:20.715
But, I mean, <i>The Lion King</i>
is Disney's big African story, right?


768
00:46:20.799 --> 00:46:26.721
And most of the actors and the writers,
they're mostly not African.


769
00:46:26.805 --> 00:46:32.560
But with our story the people
coming up with the ideas are African.


770
00:46:32.644 --> 00:46:36.272
We're Nigerian. Coming up
with the idea of a Nigerian story.


771
00:46:36.356 --> 00:46:38.858
And other songs are so much fun.

772
00:46:41.945 --> 00:46:44.155
The reason I got into animation,
which is funny,


773
00:46:44.239 --> 00:46:45.407
was <i>Lion King</i>.

774
00:46:45.490 --> 00:46:48.326
And that's what inspired me
to fall in love with animation, right?


775
00:46:48.410 --> 00:46:53.206
Both the story it tells,
i.e. becoming who you're meant to be.


776
00:46:53.289 --> 00:46:56.126
That was one of
a pivotal thing in my life.


777
00:46:56.209 --> 00:47:00.380
And funny enough, Marlon West,
who is our VFX supervisor in <i>Iwájú</i>,


778
00:47:00.463 --> 00:47:01.840
worked on the original <i>Lion King</i>.

779
00:47:01.923 --> 00:47:07.387
I remember the first Zoom meeting I had
with him and I come on the screen


780
00:47:07.470 --> 00:47:12.475
and he looks at my square
and then he looks to his other monitor,


781
00:47:12.559 --> 00:47:15.770
and I could see him, like, IMDb me

782
00:47:15.854 --> 00:47:19.107
and he looks back, goes ""

783
00:47:19.649 --> 00:47:24.320
And so I was like, "Okay,
I cut mustard with this fellow."


784
00:47:24.904 --> 00:47:26.573
- Hey.
- What's going on, man?


785
00:47:26.656 --> 00:47:27.991
- It's good to see you.
- Good to see you.


786
00:47:28.074 --> 00:47:30.618
You meet him and he's
just a normal person. Really cool guy.


787
00:47:30.702 --> 00:47:33.288
Like just another person,
just another human being, right?


788
00:47:33.371 --> 00:47:34.497
I still don't believe it.

789
00:47:34.581 --> 00:47:36.916
You know, when you're seeing people
and you're like, "Is it really them?"


790
00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:38.334
- Actually don't believe it.
- It is.


791
00:47:38.918 --> 00:47:41.296
I've always wanted to make movies.

792
00:47:41.379 --> 00:47:44.716
I got a movie camera, like,
for my 12th birthday.


793
00:47:44.799 --> 00:47:49.429
And also really into monster movies,
so I started doing stop motion animation.


794
00:47:49.929 --> 00:47:53.057
I mean, I've been at Disney for
a long time. Upwards of 30 years.


795
00:47:53.141 --> 00:47:55.560
I started here in the hand-drawn era

796
00:47:55.643 --> 00:47:58.897
and have been
head of effects since <i>Atlantis</i>


797
00:47:58.980 --> 00:48:00.732
all the way up through <i>Encanto</i>.

798
00:48:00.815 --> 00:48:04.402
Marlon's been
a part of our studio for decades.


799
00:48:04.486 --> 00:48:08.615
On a personal level, I had worked very
closely with him on <i>Frozen</i> and Frozen II


800
00:48:08.698 --> 00:48:09.783
as our head of effects.

801
00:48:10.492 --> 00:48:12.827
He's a very important leader
in our studio.


802
00:48:13.328 --> 00:48:15.830
- What was that? Ooh.
- Turn around. Turn around.


803
00:48:15.914 --> 00:48:17.665
I don't know what's in the outside.

804
00:48:19.292 --> 00:48:21.127
So I first heard about <i>Iwájú</i>

805
00:48:21.211 --> 00:48:24.130
from a studio update we had
with Clark and Jenn.


806
00:48:24.214 --> 00:48:28.259
And it just kinda started checking a lot
of boxes for me as a creative person.


807
00:48:28.343 --> 00:48:31.721
It was science fiction.
It was set in Africa.


808
00:48:31.805 --> 00:48:34.390
It was a crime story of sorts.

809
00:48:34.474 --> 00:48:40.480
He is someone, as a leader and a mentor,
who wants to help you get your vision out.


810
00:48:40.563 --> 00:48:43.191
He's the perfect person
to be there for Ziki,


811
00:48:43.274 --> 00:48:45.860
to help him and Hamid and Tolu,

812
00:48:45.944 --> 00:48:48.571
and help them understand our process.
He knew everything about it.


813
00:48:48.655 --> 00:48:50.156
As visual effects supervisor,

814
00:48:50.240 --> 00:48:54.869
I'm creatively and artistically,
technically working with our filmmakers


815
00:48:54.953 --> 00:48:57.288
to figure out exactly
how to make our film

816
00:48:57.372 --> 00:49:00.417
in the most efficient
and most beautiful way possible.


817
00:49:00.500 --> 00:49:02.252
So, if they are closer to the house,

818
00:49:03.002 --> 00:49:06.840
you know, we could either assume
that they've walked into that position


819
00:49:06.923 --> 00:49:10.051
from some other place or we can
actually show them, kind of, approach.


820
00:49:10.135 --> 00:49:11.344
To kinda take this in.

821
00:49:11.428 --> 00:49:13.346
I know I'm gonna learn
a lot from him.


822
00:49:13.430 --> 00:49:15.557
And it really--
it kind of reflects <i>Lion King</i>,


823
00:49:15.640 --> 00:49:17.809
i.e. the circle of life.

824
00:49:18.309 --> 00:49:19.728
<i>That's it. Everybody get that?</i>

825
00:49:19.811 --> 00:49:21.229
- Yep.
- Yes, thanks.


826
00:49:32.073 --> 00:49:35.160
When we started working
on <i>Iwájú</i>, I'd never been to Lagos.


827
00:49:41.916 --> 00:49:46.254
The best way I can describe it is, Lagos
has a certain audacity as a place.


828
00:49:46.337 --> 00:49:49.215
An example I'll give is you see
a really tall, beautiful building.


829
00:49:49.299 --> 00:49:51.092
Right next to it
is, like, a goat farm.

830
00:49:51.718 --> 00:49:53.011
And the energy's always high.

831
00:49:54.262 --> 00:49:58.975
But Lagos is so different in the way
there is that pushing yourself forward.


832
00:49:59.058 --> 00:50:01.811
There's a way it just wills itself to be
what it wants to be.


833
00:50:09.027 --> 00:50:11.905
It was really nice working with artists
who lived in Lagos,


834
00:50:11.988 --> 00:50:14.365
because it helped me have a starting point

835
00:50:14.449 --> 00:50:16.785
which is from people
who knew what Lagos was


836
00:50:16.868 --> 00:50:18.787
versus what people think Lagos is.

837
00:50:18.870 --> 00:50:23.083
We have a whole bunch of Africans
working on the project.


838
00:50:23.166 --> 00:50:26.836
Bill Masuku in Zimbabwe and Jason Lamy.

839
00:50:26.920 --> 00:50:29.339
Joy Alunga from Kenya.

840
00:50:29.422 --> 00:50:32.550
But then we have people
like Godwin, Bimpe.


841
00:50:32.634 --> 00:50:37.680
We have Victor, John Zino, Segun.
Those are all Lagosians.


842
00:50:38.640 --> 00:50:40.767
You know, I've been living in Lagos
all my life


843
00:50:40.850 --> 00:50:43.478
so definitely there is always traffic

844
00:50:43.561 --> 00:50:47.982
and people hawking bottled water
or maybe snacks.


845
00:50:48.066 --> 00:50:50.652
As I give them direction on what to draw,
they give me something.


846
00:50:50.735 --> 00:50:52.529
They give me the reason.
We have that back and forth.


847
00:50:52.612 --> 00:50:54.781
I think Hamid being from Uganda,

848
00:50:54.864 --> 00:50:55.824
I think it allows him

849
00:50:55.907 --> 00:50:59.202
to actually approach being
a production designer for this series


850
00:50:59.285 --> 00:51:01.037
with the idea of what's really gettable

851
00:51:01.121 --> 00:51:03.039
and digestible for an audience standpoint

852
00:51:03.123 --> 00:51:05.291
and while also being
very culturally relevant.


853
00:51:05.375 --> 00:51:08.795
You know, I think I really like it,
because one, as you know,


854
00:51:08.878 --> 00:51:11.673
like, we're trying to make this to be
like a love letter to Lagos, right?


855
00:51:13.466 --> 00:51:17.512
I like to think of it as I'm kind of,
like, leading an orchestra


856
00:51:17.595 --> 00:51:18.888
of amazing artists.

857
00:51:33.486 --> 00:51:39.117
Lagos is a melting pot. Everyone from
all over Nigeria is in Lagos.


858
00:51:39.200 --> 00:51:42.829
One of the ways a lot of people
identify themselves as African


859
00:51:42.912 --> 00:51:45.331
is from what they wear,
which would be like traditional wear.


860
00:51:45.415 --> 00:51:47.083
A lot of them
would wear the Ankara design

861
00:51:47.167 --> 00:51:49.043
which is patterns with
a lot of color in them.


862
00:51:49.127 --> 00:51:52.922
The show
had to depict our culture,


863
00:51:53.006 --> 00:51:55.842
our way of life or, like,
our way of clothing.


864
00:51:55.925 --> 00:51:58.094
If you look at
all the costumes of the characters,


865
00:51:58.178 --> 00:52:00.388
wanted to make them
not just visually interesting.


866
00:52:00.472 --> 00:52:04.350
For them to make sense for people who
are from Lagos as well was very important.


867
00:52:04.434 --> 00:52:07.562
I wanted it to have that identity
embedded inside it.


868
00:52:07.645 --> 00:52:09.647
So I added that expertise from Bimpe

869
00:52:09.731 --> 00:52:12.358
because she has a deep knowledge
in the fashion world.


870
00:52:16.112 --> 00:52:22.911
And we wanted to portray people
from different tribes of the country.


871
00:52:26.664 --> 00:52:31.795
Because we're talking about
different kinds of textiles.


872
00:52:31.878 --> 00:52:38.843
Some are woven, some are spun,
so they come with different textures.


873
00:52:42.430 --> 00:52:44.265
Tola. We're here.

874
00:52:49.437 --> 00:52:53.942
that Tola had to go to Ajegunle,

875
00:52:54.025 --> 00:52:57.695
I thought it wasn't
a scene for a dress.

876
00:52:58.196 --> 00:53:00.615
And she also still has to be cute,

877
00:53:00.698 --> 00:53:04.953
you know, so I thought
what would be nice would be a jumpsuit.


878
00:53:06.579 --> 00:53:12.919
The indigo fabric that I suggested
for her outfit is special to Nigeria.


879
00:53:13.002 --> 00:53:16.631
The particular designs that I chose,

880
00:53:16.714 --> 00:53:20.593
a cowrie shell is significant
in so many ways.


881
00:53:20.677 --> 00:53:21.636
It's from the sea.

882
00:53:21.719 --> 00:53:26.391
Lagos is called the place
of aquatic splendor, center of excellence,


883
00:53:26.474 --> 00:53:32.021
but the cowrie was also
a former legal tender in Nigeria.


884
00:53:32.105 --> 00:53:36.609
And, hey, she's the daughter
of a billionaire.


885
00:53:39.195 --> 00:53:41.698
Oya, who wan chop?

886
00:53:44.367 --> 00:53:48.663
Hamid wanted Bode in <i>agbada</i>.

887
00:53:48.747 --> 00:53:53.209
<i>Agbada</i> is basically a
three-piece suit. Quite stately, it's big.


888
00:53:53.293 --> 00:53:59.132
You wouldn't, on a normal day,
just be wearing that on the street.


889
00:53:59.215 --> 00:54:02.135
You would be wearing it
maybe for a function.


890
00:54:02.218 --> 00:54:06.598
Everything about him had to be big.
Jumbo coral beads. Who wears that,


891
00:54:06.681 --> 00:54:11.436
you know, like, on a normal day. You have
to be a chief or a king or something.


892
00:54:11.519 --> 00:54:13.146
So many rings.

893
00:54:13.229 --> 00:54:15.148
I mean, his watch can buy you--

894
00:54:15.231 --> 00:54:18.318
maybe he even orders
from Rolex ahead of time.


895
00:54:18.401 --> 00:54:21.654
You know, just to show that,
"Well, we run the show here."


896
00:54:25.784 --> 00:54:28.912
Ziki, as he was writing
the story about class and division,


897
00:54:28.995 --> 00:54:31.372
in Lagos itself we have the mainland
and the island,


898
00:54:31.456 --> 00:54:34.292
and there's an actual water body
separating the two bodies, right.


899
00:54:34.375 --> 00:54:38.379
And one side of Lagos is full
of the most wealthy people


900
00:54:38.463 --> 00:54:41.466
where the other side is not as wealthy
as the other one.


901
00:54:41.549 --> 00:54:44.052
There's something a little bit dystopian
about the fact


902
00:54:44.135 --> 00:54:48.932
that you have a body of water separating
the wealthy from those who are not.


903
00:54:49.015 --> 00:54:52.310
That was something you could really sink
your teeth in as visual storytelling


904
00:54:52.394 --> 00:54:56.231
that we could build this world
on one side of the water


905
00:54:56.314 --> 00:55:01.486
versus this other world
and have this very clear difference


906
00:55:01.569 --> 00:55:03.196
between haves and have-nots.

907
00:55:04.322 --> 00:55:06.116
I was trying to show
the wealthy side of Africa.


908
00:55:06.199 --> 00:55:08.952
And I was trying to think of where
to show that that's, one, unique


909
00:55:09.035 --> 00:55:11.162
and, two, would speak
to the culture of Lagos.


910
00:55:11.788 --> 00:55:15.500
For example, if you come
to the main town part of the island,


911
00:55:15.583 --> 00:55:17.043
which is a more affluent area,

912
00:55:17.127 --> 00:55:20.296
they have the sculpture buildings
which are buildings made out of sculptures


913
00:55:20.380 --> 00:55:23.258
where the rich people of Lagos
would live inside,


914
00:55:23.341 --> 00:55:26.428
and it's almost like they're living
in an art piece that represents Lagos.


915
00:55:26.511 --> 00:55:29.806
Whereas when you come to the mainland,
we go all the way to the extreme


916
00:55:29.889 --> 00:55:33.601
where we have houses made out of what
would be containers,


917
00:55:33.685 --> 00:55:35.895
maybe travel containers. And they
were kind of modified to be houses.


918
00:55:35.979 --> 00:55:41.693
So if you look at the design here,
there is just so much density.


919
00:55:41.776 --> 00:55:44.988
I tried as much as possible
to integrate everything


920
00:55:48.241 --> 00:55:52.829
So we have Lagos today and then <i>Iwájú</i>
is just an amplification of that.


921
00:55:52.912 --> 00:55:54.330
In a futuristic sense.

922
00:55:55.832 --> 00:55:57.292
Happy birthday.

923
00:55:58.042 --> 00:56:00.420
This is Otin.

924
00:56:01.755 --> 00:56:03.298
At some point,

925
00:56:03.381 --> 00:56:08.928
I realized that we needed
an animal character in the show.


926
00:56:09.012 --> 00:56:11.723
And I didn't wanna do just any animal.

927
00:56:11.806 --> 00:56:14.517
I just had this eureka moment
of an agama lizard.


928
00:56:14.601 --> 00:56:17.812
Something that every Nigerian watching
would be like, "Wow."


929
00:56:18.938 --> 00:56:21.149
That's the lizard in my backyard.

930
00:56:22.275 --> 00:56:26.279
They're very common in West Africa.

931
00:56:27.906 --> 00:56:31.743
The whole idea
is Tola dislikes agama lizards,


932
00:56:31.826 --> 00:56:37.040
and Tunde has this idea or sense
that children love lizards.


933
00:56:37.123 --> 00:56:39.084
You once asked for a pet,

934
00:56:39.167 --> 00:56:42.587
and research shows
that children love lizards.


935
00:56:43.671 --> 00:56:47.342
So I thought what better way to show
how little he knows


936
00:56:47.425 --> 00:56:50.386
about the tastes of children
or even about lizards.


937
00:56:51.012 --> 00:56:54.099
It's great. <i>E se baba.</i>

938
00:56:54.182 --> 00:56:58.603
In Nigeria, children would not
have agama lizards as pets.


939
00:57:03.691 --> 00:57:06.236
Yo, we know that sound.
Puff puff! Puff puff!


940
00:57:10.115 --> 00:57:15.578
In the story there are a few
key moments with respect to food.


941
00:57:15.662 --> 00:57:18.248
We have puff puff, for example.

942
00:57:18.331 --> 00:57:21.167
- Let us, like, ten pieces.
- Ten pieces, yeah?


943
00:57:21.251 --> 00:57:23.711
Think of it as a Nigerian doughnut.

944
00:57:23.795 --> 00:57:29.092
The main difference is the mix of spices
that are used to give it its flavor.


945
00:57:29.175 --> 00:57:30.385
Thank you.

946
00:57:30.468 --> 00:57:31.511
Ooh!

947
00:57:35.390 --> 00:57:41.271
Tola's a lot more fascinated
by the local authentic food.


948
00:57:43.565 --> 00:57:48.069
It is actually incredibly delicious,
you know, it's full of flavor.


949
00:57:48.153 --> 00:57:49.738
It's visually striking.

950
00:57:49.821 --> 00:57:54.075
If Tola was so interested
in eating mainland food,


951
00:57:54.159 --> 00:57:56.619
Kole would definitely want
to take Tola to a mama puts.


952
00:58:06.671 --> 00:58:07.922
Yes.

953
00:58:08.757 --> 00:58:10.884
They call these places "mama puts"

954
00:58:10.967 --> 00:58:13.845
because usually the person serving
would be a lady.


955
00:58:13.928 --> 00:58:18.558
It's usually run by women
and they're like, "Mama puts three eba."


956
00:58:18.641 --> 00:58:21.978
"Puts one fish", "puts one ponmo".

957
00:58:22.062 --> 00:58:25.523
Yeah, so Ziki, have you ever actually
eaten at a mama puts before?


958
00:58:25.607 --> 00:58:29.903
Yeah. Last time was maybe when I was,
like, ten or 11 years old.


959
00:58:29.986 --> 00:58:32.614
What! That is forever ago.

960
00:58:32.697 --> 00:58:34.074
I really like the energy of the place

961
00:58:34.157 --> 00:58:37.660
in terms of just, like,
I like the feeling of it.


962
00:58:37.744 --> 00:58:41.748
This type of food is affordable
to the mass populous you find here.


963
00:58:41.831 --> 00:58:47.462
And that's why I felt like in the story
we needed to have the mainland characters


964
00:58:47.545 --> 00:58:50.590
eat at mama puts
because it's natural to them.


965
00:58:50.673 --> 00:58:53.426
And they're not going to go to,
like, a fancy restaurant


966
00:58:53.510 --> 00:58:57.013
and order non
-Nigerian food.

967
00:58:58.306 --> 00:59:00.266
I'm eating with my hands.

968
00:59:00.350 --> 00:59:02.811
My hands, Kole.

969
00:59:02.894 --> 00:59:06.439
Primarily we have
the characters eating swallow


970
00:59:06.523 --> 00:59:10.652
which is, the closest western analogy
I can think of is, mashed potato


971
00:59:10.735 --> 00:59:11.945
but it's a little bit different.

972
00:59:12.028 --> 00:59:17.826
Swallow is some sort of tuber
that is mashed up and cooked,


973
00:59:18.493 --> 00:59:21.329
eaten alongside what we would call soup,

974
00:59:21.413 --> 00:59:24.541
but it's not like the typical soup
you eat with a spoon.


975
00:59:24.624 --> 00:59:27.210
It has a little
bit more texture to it

976
00:59:27.293 --> 00:59:32.549
and you mix the soup with some
fried meat, vegetables, spices,


977
00:59:32.632 --> 00:59:33.842
and then you eat that all together

978
00:59:33.925 --> 00:59:38.346
and that is one of the most authentically
Nigerian dining experiences.


979
00:59:38.430 --> 00:59:40.682
I just tasted the soup and I was like,
"Okay, I'm not--


980
00:59:40.765 --> 00:59:42.559
That's not my level of pepper."

981
00:59:43.268 --> 00:59:47.939
West African food in general
is very different from East African food.


982
00:59:48.022 --> 00:59:50.734
But the biggest difference would be
the amount of spices.


983
00:59:50.817 --> 00:59:53.403
When I was a kid, they…

984
00:59:53.486 --> 00:59:56.030
When they were cooking, I could…

985
00:59:56.114 --> 00:59:58.575
I would already be sweating.
Like, I'm not even eating it.


986
00:59:58.658 --> 01:00:03.580
And then the-- the aromas emanating
from the kitchen were pretty difficult.


987
01:00:03.663 --> 01:00:06.708
I would say they don't really care
about the taste of their food.


988
01:00:06.791 --> 01:00:08.960
They just wanna burn your tongue.
That's my perspective.


989
01:00:09.043 --> 01:00:10.754
Humble opinion. Right?

990
01:00:10.837 --> 01:00:13.965
So someone who's not used to that is,
you know…


991
01:00:14.048 --> 01:00:16.259
I would recommend they stay safe.

992
01:00:19.137 --> 01:00:21.556
Bring on the pepper!

993
01:00:21.639 --> 01:00:24.434
This party has to be perfect.

994
01:00:27.729 --> 01:00:29.856
This music is gonna be
a big part of the show


995
01:00:29.939 --> 01:00:31.858
because it's very big part of the culture.

996
01:00:37.864 --> 01:00:41.576
Ré Olunuga is a musical composer.

997
01:00:44.537 --> 01:00:47.457
More than anything,
I consider myself a storyteller.


998
01:00:47.540 --> 01:00:52.670
The medium I use most often is music,
but the compulsion is to tell stories.


999
01:00:54.923 --> 01:00:58.218
The passion for the work
really just shows. It's very infectious.


1000
01:00:58.301 --> 01:01:01.679
Yeah. I think overall it's-- it's solid.
I mean, it's completely different sound.


1001
01:01:03.389 --> 01:01:06.643
Just what he reaches for
in his storytelling,


1002
01:01:06.726 --> 01:01:09.604
um, similar things to what I reach for.

1003
01:01:09.687 --> 01:01:13.775
More than anything we share an excitement
to tell this type of story.


1004
01:01:13.858 --> 01:01:15.276
He's from Nigeria,

1005
01:01:15.360 --> 01:01:21.157
so he has a very clear
and direct understanding of the culture.


1006
01:01:30.083 --> 01:01:33.920
So most of the music is orchestral.

1007
01:01:34.838 --> 01:01:39.050
But Lagos is a unique city.
It's a city like no other city.


1008
01:01:39.134 --> 01:01:42.720
So it's probably not gonna evolve
in the ways that people expect.


1009
01:01:45.181 --> 01:01:51.980
We have harp duets,
and we have this fusion of


1010
01:01:52.063 --> 01:01:54.899
African instruments
and African performers.


1011
01:01:54.983 --> 01:02:00.488
From Afrobeats to highlife
that feels recognizable and familiar,


1012
01:02:00.572 --> 01:02:06.077
but also feels representative of
an imagined future.


1013
01:02:06.161 --> 01:02:11.124
Um, I'm super excited for today because
we're doing some special cues today.


1014
01:02:11.666 --> 01:02:14.294
Um, I hope that you all have fun.

1015
01:02:14.377 --> 01:02:15.628
It's gonna be awesome.

1016
01:02:15.712 --> 01:02:18.173
So, thank you again.
I'm looking forward to it.


1017
01:02:18.256 --> 01:02:19.299
Thank you.

1018
01:02:23.928 --> 01:02:26.765
The first time we were
on that scoring stage


1019
01:02:27.348 --> 01:02:31.770
and the conductor gives them the cue…

1020
01:02:32.979 --> 01:02:34.230
…and they start…

1021
01:02:37.609 --> 01:02:40.904
is one of the most special moments
a person, a human can experience


1022
01:02:40.987 --> 01:02:43.990
because it's your dreams coming to life.

1023
01:02:52.415 --> 01:02:57.462
The process of recording an orchestra,
especially for a Disney project,


1024
01:02:57.545 --> 01:02:59.756
is unlike any other thing

1025
01:02:59.839 --> 01:03:03.134
because you're working with
some of the best musicians in the world.


1026
01:03:04.260 --> 01:03:07.305
Crescendo for two bars,
to mezzo-piano beginning of 18.


1027
01:03:07.388 --> 01:03:11.643
And then you crescendo for one bar
at the-- all of 19. And that's a forte.


1028
01:03:20.819 --> 01:03:23.321
<i>She dey tear out the pages</i>
<i>and throw them like ninja stars.</i>


1029
01:03:23.405 --> 01:03:25.532
Like…

1030
01:03:25.615 --> 01:03:26.825
Stop this.

1031
01:03:26.908 --> 01:03:28.410
Sorry, sa.

1032
01:03:34.249 --> 01:03:35.959
Okay.

1033
01:03:45.343 --> 01:03:47.345
…not enough.

1034
01:03:57.772 --> 01:04:00.275
I should hold on to everything they say.

1035
01:04:02.902 --> 01:04:06.781
We're an army
to just help tell the story of <i>Iwájú</i>


1036
01:04:09.701 --> 01:04:11.202
You know,
this has been our heartbeat


1037
01:04:11.286 --> 01:04:14.706
for the best part of about three years.

1038
01:04:14.789 --> 01:04:19.461
And so to think that, you know, all of it
is coming to an end soon, it's crazy.


1039
01:04:20.754 --> 01:04:22.380
It's
one of those things where


1040
01:04:23.131 --> 01:04:27.635
the impact and effect,
I'm starting to see how big it will be.


1041
01:04:28.553 --> 01:04:30.388
There is that
weight of responsibility.


1042
01:04:30.472 --> 01:04:33.391
It has to live up to the legacy
of what it is.


1043
01:04:33.475 --> 01:04:36.978
Because it's such a huge--
it's a very strong, big move


1044
01:04:37.062 --> 01:04:38.438
in African visual storytelling.

1045
01:04:47.113 --> 01:04:54.120
The D23 Expo is this incredible gathering
of, you know, the greatest Disney fans.


1046
01:04:56.581 --> 01:04:57.582
Hi!

1047
01:04:58.333 --> 01:05:00.668
And for us, it means a lot.

1048
01:05:00.752 --> 01:05:04.923
We actually keep a lot of things secret
just to launch here.


1049
01:05:05.006 --> 01:05:07.133
It's an opportunity for us

1050
01:05:07.217 --> 01:05:09.511
as filmmakers to share
what are we working on,


1051
01:05:09.594 --> 01:05:13.640
to give a little glimpse into
behind the scenes of what's happening


1052
01:05:13.723 --> 01:05:15.225
at Walt Disney Animation Studios.

1053
01:05:15.308 --> 01:05:18.603
And the story of <i>Iwájú</i>
starts to become part of the world.


1054
01:05:22.065 --> 01:05:28.738
It feels very cathartic
because I'm here with Tolu and Hamid,


1055
01:05:28.822 --> 01:05:32.242
and I remember when we were
just starting Kugali,


1056
01:05:32.325 --> 01:05:36.579
it was just really the three of us
who had a dream that we believed in


1057
01:05:36.663 --> 01:05:38.998
and worked very hard.

1058
01:05:39.082 --> 01:05:43.336
We have not been
able to talk about our projects much.


1059
01:05:43.420 --> 01:05:46.172
We've been working on it
for almost four years.


1060
01:05:46.673 --> 01:05:49.217
It's the first chance
that we'll actually get


1061
01:05:49.300 --> 01:05:52.011
to share what we've been working on
for so long with the world.


1062
01:05:52.095 --> 01:05:54.556
When you're working on something,
you think you know what it is


1063
01:05:54.639 --> 01:05:56.266
but you don't know
how the world is gonna receive it,


1064
01:05:56.349 --> 01:05:58.226
so I'm looking forward
to the world seeing this.


1065
01:05:59.102 --> 01:06:01.563
It's gonna be great
to actually finally share it


1066
01:06:01.646 --> 01:06:05.483
and let everyone see the beauty
and amazement of <i>Iwájú</i>.


1067
01:06:10.447 --> 01:06:12.824
For a guy,
you look pretty.


1068
01:06:12.907 --> 01:06:15.118
- I know.
- Boy.


1069
01:06:28.047 --> 01:06:30.467
I'm really just
trying to stay present.


1070
01:06:30.550 --> 01:06:35.472
You know, there is obviously a little part
of me that is a little bit nervous


1071
01:06:35.555 --> 01:06:38.725
because this is the largest
crowd of people


1072
01:06:38.808 --> 01:06:41.853
I will have ever addressed in my life.

1073
01:06:41.936 --> 01:06:44.189
It's been absolutely crazy
and I cannot wait to get on stage.


1074
01:06:44.272 --> 01:06:46.483
It's like 7,000 people,
first time doing this.


1075
01:06:48.026 --> 01:06:51.196
Please welcome to the stage
the Kugali founders.


1076
01:06:53.531 --> 01:06:54.407
Disney!

1077
01:06:54.491 --> 01:06:56.701
Hey, D23!

1078
01:06:57.410 --> 01:06:58.870
How you guys doing?

1079
01:06:59.454 --> 01:07:02.707
- Hello, D23.
- Are you ready for Africa?


1080
01:07:02.791 --> 01:07:05.668
Yeah!

1081
01:07:13.259 --> 01:07:17.055
To be here, and to have Ziki
and Hamid and Tolu all here,


1082
01:07:17.138 --> 01:07:19.557
in front of 7,000 people,

1083
01:07:19.641 --> 01:07:23.895
talking about a project that
just a couple years ago did not exist,


1084
01:07:24.604 --> 01:07:28.358
because of a phone call,
is an incredible moment in time.


1085
01:07:28.441 --> 01:07:31.820
We are really excited
to be working alongside Disney Animation


1086
01:07:31.903 --> 01:07:34.614
to bring you a special story.

1087
01:07:34.697 --> 01:07:37.033
A story from Africa.

1088
01:07:37.117 --> 01:07:40.370
And to see them…

1089
01:07:41.621 --> 01:07:45.625
Sorry. Um, you know.

1090
01:07:46.751 --> 01:07:48.753
To see them up there was really special.

1091
01:07:49.337 --> 01:07:51.673
My hopes for <i>Iwájú</i>
is it's just a beginning.


1092
01:07:51.756 --> 01:07:53.883
Getting stories from around the world

1093
01:07:53.967 --> 01:07:58.012
and being exposed
to different kinds of storytelling.


1094
01:07:58.096 --> 01:07:59.681
We're gonna always evolve as storytellers.

1095
01:07:59.764 --> 01:08:01.516
We are going to keep pushing ourselves.

1096
01:08:01.599 --> 01:08:06.521
I hope that people just see
true and authentic relationship


1097
01:08:06.604 --> 01:08:11.401
between this girl and her father,
this girl and her friend,


1098
01:08:12.026 --> 01:08:16.114
through this very, very,
very, very, very Nigerian lens.


1099
01:08:16.197 --> 01:08:19.784
You know what I mean? And it's just
like, that they get all of the culture.


1100
01:08:19.868 --> 01:08:22.537
Just the richness of that,
but that they relate to it.


1101
01:08:22.620 --> 01:08:27.959
I think when people see Tola
in her mansion in Lagos


1102
01:08:28.042 --> 01:08:31.504
that gets up and jumps on her hoverboard
and makes puff puffs,


1103
01:08:31.588 --> 01:08:36.259
I think people will go, like, "I had
no idea how much I needed to see that."


1104
01:08:36.342 --> 01:08:39.679
Whether it's some kid in Lagos
who sees themselves in the character,


1105
01:08:39.763 --> 01:08:42.182
or someone who's never been to Lagos

1106
01:08:42.265 --> 01:08:43.933
or maybe have never even heard of Lagos,

1107
01:08:44.017 --> 01:08:46.394
and they see a bit of themselves
in the characters,


1108
01:08:46.478 --> 01:08:48.730
because I think
that if something resonates,


1109
01:08:48.813 --> 01:08:51.274
it means it's universal enough
to illicit a feeling.


1110
01:08:51.357 --> 01:08:54.444
And I think that's all
we're really ever trying to do


1111
01:08:54.527 --> 01:08:56.696
whenever we tell these stories at Disney.

1112
01:08:56.780 --> 01:08:58.907
I've seen a story come to life,

1113
01:08:58.990 --> 01:09:04.913
I've seen a beautiful story
just emerge out of artistic ambition


1114
01:09:04.996 --> 01:09:08.666
and… but I'm really, really
excited for the audience.


1115
01:09:08.750 --> 01:09:11.920
I'm hoping that
they find it as special as we do.


1116
01:09:12.003 --> 01:09:15.840
What this is doing,
it's saying there are possibilities.


1117
01:09:15.924 --> 01:09:18.426
You can tell all kinds of stories

1118
01:09:18.510 --> 01:09:20.929
and the world will see it
and celebrate it.


1119
01:09:21.012 --> 01:09:24.349
They say people from Africa, you have
a lot of spice and pepper to their food.


1120
01:09:24.432 --> 01:09:27.143
I think we're the spice and pepper
to Disney that they needed.


1121
01:09:27.227 --> 01:09:30.480
I hope <i>Iwájú</i> launches
the next generation of artists.


1122
01:09:30.563 --> 01:09:34.234
I hope it's a point of inspiration
for artists all over the continent.


1123
01:09:34.317 --> 01:09:35.985
All over the world as well.

1124
01:09:36.069 --> 01:09:40.156
Just to dare to tell stories differently.
To dare to do things in a different way.


1125
01:09:40.240 --> 01:09:46.204
I feel like life is going to change
permanently for myself, Hamid and Tolu.


1126
01:09:46.287 --> 01:09:50.792
And it's somewhat surreal
and, honestly, a little bit daunting.


1127
01:09:50.875 --> 01:09:55.255
There is nothing in the 100-year
portfolio of Disney Animation


1128
01:09:55.338 --> 01:09:57.090
that feels like our show.

1129
01:09:57.173 --> 01:09:58.716
It feels very different.

1130
01:09:58.800 --> 01:10:02.053
You don't think,
"I'm going to make a video game


1131
01:10:02.137 --> 01:10:05.181
or a movie with Disney."

1132
01:10:05.849 --> 01:10:11.146
Most people from Africa and Nigeria
in particular do not dream that way


1133
01:10:11.229 --> 01:10:13.314
because it just
doesn't seem realistic to them.


1134
01:10:13.398 --> 01:10:16.526
I've never been realistic
and I think it's worked out very well,


1135
01:10:16.609 --> 01:10:20.447
but I hope that now I can
help other people to realize


1136
01:10:20.530 --> 01:10:22.157
their dreams don't turn to dust.
