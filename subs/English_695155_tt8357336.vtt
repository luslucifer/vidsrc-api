Thank you.

22
00:04:58.615 --> 00:05:01.198
Your mother or father around?

23
00:05:02.198 --> 00:05:03.698
I didn't think so.

24
00:05:04.531 --> 00:05:05.365
You'd better hurry.

25
00:05:05.365 --> 00:05:07.448
Sky's gonna open up soon.

26
00:05:11.906 --> 00:05:14.865
You know, I've always
liked that expression.


27
00:05:14.865 --> 00:05:17.115
Can I help you with something?

28
00:05:17.115 --> 00:05:18.365
You sure can.

29
00:05:19.365 --> 00:05:23.073
Can you tell me
what that is out there?

30
00:05:23.073 --> 00:05:25.115
Oh, that old thing.

31
00:05:25.115 --> 00:05:27.906
Daddy doesn't want anyone going near it.

32
00:05:27.906 --> 00:05:30.573
He doesn't want them to fall in.

33
00:05:32.906 --> 00:05:33.990
To fall in?

00:06:21.573 --> 00:06:22.406

Well, hello there, gentlemen.

45
00:07:40.198 --> 00:07:41.698
Look at that motherfucker, Gabe,

46
00:07:41.698 --> 00:07:43.448
shit eating grin.

47
00:07:43.448 --> 00:07:47.698
You mind telling me what
you're doing on my land?


48
00:07:50.406 --> 00:07:52.323
Well, it appears Uncle
Sam's got me filling in


49
00:07:52.323 --> 00:07:53.823
on surveying duties today.

50
00:07:53.823 --> 00:07:54.948
Surveying, Gabe?

51
00:07:54.948 --> 00:07:55.990
Charting out the boundaries--

52
00:07:55.990 --> 00:07:56.781
The land--

53
00:07:56.781 --> 00:07:57.615
Of the neighboring reservation--

54
00:07:57.615 --> 00:07:58.448
Again?

55
00:07:58.448 --> 00:08:00.240
Actually just measuring
that last feature over there.


56
00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:01.406
Then I'm gone.

57
00:08:05.198 --> 00:08:08.031
Thing is my readings
are all off on it,

58
00:08:08.031 --> 00:08:11.281
so I've got to
take another look at it.

59
00:08:11.281 --> 00:08:13.990
Seems to form the northeastern boundary.

60
00:08:13.990 --> 00:08:15.156
Is that right?

61
00:08:17.823 --> 00:08:20.573
You fellas been shooting
trap or something?


62
00:08:20.573 --> 00:08:23.073
The neighbor's fucking dogs.

[man sighing]

64
00:08:28.115 --> 00:08:32.781
Fellas, honest, there's
nothing to worry about here.


65
00:08:32.781 --> 00:08:34.948
To be straight, 
I'm just an archeologist

66
00:08:34.948 --> 00:08:36.740
with the Bureau of Land Management.

67

BLM.

68
00:08:37.823 --> 00:08:38.656
Fuck, Gabe.

69
00:08:38.656 --> 00:08:40.281
This isn't even really my thing.

70
00:08:40.281 --> 00:08:42.531
If you're a fed,
let me see some ID.

71
00:08:42.531 --> 00:08:44.406
Sure thing.

72
00:08:44.406 --> 00:08:45.531
Easy.

73
00:08:45.531 --> 00:08:46.365
Thank you.

74
00:08:46.365 --> 00:08:48.115
So as I was saying,

75
00:08:49.073 --> 00:08:51.490
what we're trying to
determine here is where--


76
00:08:51.490 --> 00:08:53.115
You ain't the first
that's been sent out here.


77
00:08:53.115 --> 00:08:55.156
You know that right?

78
00:08:55.156 --> 00:08:56.573
Oh no?

79
00:08:56.573 --> 00:08:58.073
And what happened?

80
00:08:58.948 --> 00:09:00.990
The other guy just didn't
take a look at that.

83
00:09:02.906 --> 00:09:04.281
Why the hell did you do that--

84
00:09:04.281 --> 00:09:05.115
I had to.

85
00:09:05.115 --> 00:09:06.406
[mumbling]

86
00:09:06.406 --> 00:09:07.240

You fucked up, Michael.

90
00:09:27.531 --> 00:09:28.365
You fucked him up,

91
00:09:28.365 --> 00:09:29.198
and you fucked up.

92
00:09:29.198 --> 00:09:32.115
They're all gonna be over here now.

93
00:09:33.698 --> 00:09:35.740
Gabe, what are we gonna do?

94
00:09:35.740 --> 00:09:38.240
What are we gonna do with him?

[insects chirping]

96

Let's just get him in the truck.

00:09:48.990 --> 00:09:50.323
And then what?

98
00:09:50.323 --> 00:09:52.615
Gabe, and then what?

99
00:09:52.615 --> 00:09:55.031
You're not gonna take
him into town, are you?


100

Gabe.

101

He will.

He'll take you out into the field

105
00:10:04.323 --> 00:10:07.448
and flatten your head while
you're still breathing.

Gabriel.

There's a shit storm coming our way.

108
00:10:11.740 --> 00:10:14.323
Get up on that hill over yonder.

109
00:10:14.323 --> 00:10:15.990
They'll protect you.

were just doing your job.

00:16:23.906 --> 00:16:26.156
I'm just doing my job.

180
00:16:26.156 --> 00:16:27.490
You were saying?

181
00:16:29.490 --> 00:16:31.156
Just doing my job.

182
00:16:33.531 --> 00:16:34.990
Hey, can I get some sugar over here?

183
00:16:34.990 --> 00:16:36.490
Sure can, sugar.

184
00:16:39.656 --> 00:16:41.448
And so all these good old boys,

185
00:16:41.448 --> 00:16:42.823
they try to find some cause

186
00:16:42.823 --> 00:16:45.490
to take umbrage with your trespassing

187
00:16:45.490 --> 00:16:46.656
on their land?

188
00:16:50.490 --> 00:16:52.573
Just a small farm.

I don't even know
if they own the place,

00:16:54.323 --> 00:16:56.490
but they came at me and...

191
00:17:00.156 --> 00:17:02.740
Hey, where did I park my truck?

192
00:17:07.698 --> 00:17:10.156
Have you seen my truck?

193
00:17:10.156 --> 00:17:11.448
Easy.

194
00:17:11.448 --> 00:17:13.906
It's outside the motel.

195
00:17:13.906 --> 00:17:14.906
The motel.

00:17:18.198 --> 00:17:19.365

you say you found something out there.

Yes.

00:18:00.406 --> 00:18:02.240
Ben, how are my girls?

I had three beautiful

Oh, them.

That was a long time ago, Tom.

They're not your girls anymore.

This is not whatever
you wanted to use it for.

not a public bathroom.

This is a library.

So who does one see
about getting a card?


235
00:21:31.656 --> 00:21:35.656
No, really, I just need
to call into my office.

What are you, a professional drifter?

in the community area downstairs.

Use it, and leave.

Sure did.

a little culture around here.

around with Gabe and Mike.

see a guy out there, did you,

Strange man, huh?

He might have had a slight
injury to the head right here.

00:38:10.740 --> 00:38:11.698
That's okay, Tiny.

515
00:38:11.698 --> 00:38:12.948
I don't think this gentleman's here

516
00:38:12.948 --> 00:38:15.490
to indulge in our delicacies.

517
00:38:15.490 --> 00:38:18.156
By the way, that's a
nasty gash you got there.


518
00:38:18.156 --> 00:38:19.365
Given state health code,

519
00:38:19.365 --> 00:38:22.740
I'd steer clear of the frying vats,

520
00:38:22.740 --> 00:38:24.948
so what can I do you for?

521
00:38:24.948 --> 00:38:26.531
You Roger, Roger Person?

522
00:38:27.531 --> 00:38:28.990
Sure, why not?

523
00:38:28.990 --> 00:38:32.906
Roger Person with the
Bureau of Land Management?


524
00:38:32.906 --> 00:38:34.615
It's ancient history, man.

525
00:38:34.615 --> 00:38:35.448
Back in my day,

526
00:38:35.448 --> 00:38:39.031
we were known as
the Bureau of Lonely Men.

527
00:38:39.031 --> 00:38:41.906
I contract as an archeologist.

528
00:38:41.906 --> 00:38:42.740
Oh, good for you.

529
00:38:42.740 --> 00:38:45.281
Your parents must be proud.

530
00:38:45.281 --> 00:38:48.198
I'd like to ask you some
questions about the town records.


531
00:38:48.198 --> 00:38:50.323
Your surveys are incomplete.

532
00:38:50.323 --> 00:38:53.740
These are highly irregular hours.

533
00:38:53.740 --> 00:38:57.490
Why don't you come back, say, Tuesday?

534
00:38:57.490 --> 00:38:59.781
Plan to get a
jump on a weekend bender

535
00:38:59.781 --> 00:39:02.448
and duck out of here early.

536
00:39:02.448 --> 00:39:05.281
Do you know anything about 'them'?

537
00:39:07.698 --> 00:39:08.531
'Them'?

538
00:39:09.573 --> 00:39:10.573
Just 'them'.

539
00:39:11.823 --> 00:39:14.073
Geez, this is circuitous.

540
00:39:14.073 --> 00:39:16.115
Why don't we go someplace else?

00:39:20.490 --> 00:39:21.573

545
00:39:27.490 --> 00:39:31.281
Can't we go somewhere a
little less conspicuous?


546
00:39:31.281 --> 00:39:34.865
No one's paying us
any attention up here.


547
00:39:35.948 --> 00:39:36.906
No thanks.

548
00:39:36.906 --> 00:39:40.406
I've got little girls
I'd like to see grow up.

one of the last remaining.

555
00:39:54.865 --> 00:39:57.156
Wouldn't be surprised
if it were one big cult.


556
00:39:57.156 --> 00:39:58.448
It is one big cult,

557
00:39:58.448 --> 00:40:02.948
all of them, every single
one, even the kids.


558

You're kidding.

00:40:04.406 --> 00:40:05.656
You're serious?

560
00:40:06.615 --> 00:40:09.990
These people seem so, what's the word?

561
00:40:09.990 --> 00:40:11.573
Normal?

Yeah, a bunch of
providential natalists.

That's why there's so many of them.

564
00:40:14.448 --> 00:40:17.573
They keep popping them out
to keep the faith going.

Going where?

566
00:40:19.823 --> 00:40:21.281
Where the hell is anything going?

567
00:40:21.281 --> 00:40:22.323
Just round and round

568
00:40:22.323 --> 00:40:24.240
and back to the ground.

569
00:40:25.115 --> 00:40:26.198
We all come from the earth

570
00:40:26.198 --> 00:40:28.240
and like fools reach out to the stars,

571

572
00:40:30.073 --> 00:40:33.698
Eternal life, the stairway to heaven?

573
00:40:33.698 --> 00:40:34.698
When it's all said and done,

574
00:40:34.698 --> 00:40:36.615
we end up right back where we started,

575
00:40:36.615 --> 00:40:38.656
in the good old Mother
Earth 10 feet under,


576
00:40:38.656 --> 00:40:40.656
just more food for
the gods to take in

577
00:40:40.656 --> 00:40:41.531
and spit out

and start this whole fucked
up cycle all over again,

travel all this way

just to hear all my philosophical
horse shit, did you?


581
00:40:52.781 --> 00:40:54.073
You got that right.

582
00:40:54.073 --> 00:40:56.865
What happened to the records, Roger?

583
00:40:56.865 --> 00:40:58.656
Records were fudged,

584
00:40:58.656 --> 00:41:00.698
maybe to keep you boys out of here,

585
00:41:00.698 --> 00:41:01.531
keep them out of reach

587
00:41:03.823 --> 00:41:05.865
Well, that didn't work.

588
00:41:05.865 --> 00:41:06.698
No, it didn't.

00:41:06.698 --> 00:41:08.990
State kept coming.

590
00:41:08.990 --> 00:41:11.573
So I guess I caught
you in a fib there.

00:41:11.573 --> 00:41:13.073
I guess you did.

592
00:41:14.698 --> 00:41:19.115
I read another name on
the survey, Wolcraftson.


593
00:41:19.115 --> 00:41:22.031
Wolcraftson, oh, that son of a,

where did you get his name?

595

I'm a bookish sort.

596
00:41:24.948 --> 00:41:28.823
Wolfcraftson was my
illustrious predecessor.


597
00:41:28.823 --> 00:41:31.406
Died of a heart attack, as I recall,

598
00:41:31.406 --> 00:41:32.990
and on that ranch, I think.

599
00:41:32.990 --> 00:41:35.240
He died on the Caster farm?

600
00:41:35.240 --> 00:41:37.073
Something like that.

601
00:41:38.115 --> 00:41:40.323
Wolfcraftson made the
only complete survey.

I've got the original
right here in my pocket.


603
00:41:42.531 --> 00:41:44.615
Only thing is, 
Wolfcraftson was wrong.

604
00:41:44.615 --> 00:41:47.365
He put the top of that
hill 100 feet underground.


605
00:41:47.365 --> 00:41:50.531
That's not something that just happens.

606
00:41:50.531 --> 00:41:54.490
Some alternative
science might explain it.

No.

I got the same readings.

Oh, what did you do?

01:06:39.115 --> 01:06:40.240
Did what I had to do.

1028
01:06:40.240 --> 01:06:41.656
He didn't see what I saw.

1029
01:06:41.656 --> 01:06:42.906
Had to put him in a time out

like pretty boy over there.

No, no, he wasn't, was he?

He was doing just that.

1033
01:06:47.740 --> 01:06:49.115
But he wouldn't.

1034

He wouldn't.

He's so good.

Lucky thing for you

I was out trolling the woods this morning.

but the pulse is still okay.

This fucker deserves a good laceration.

Yeah, no signal.

I can't call for help around here, man.

Well, would you look at that?

You tricked me out here.

What's gonna happen to him?

1057
01:07:56.531 --> 01:07:58.615
That man is a dead man.

1058
