1
00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:09.550
The village shop and post office
had come up for sale.


2
00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:14.350
Someone suggested that I would be
the perfect person to take it over.


3
00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:20.030
I started my first job
as a postman back in 1965.


4
00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:24.390
and in 1994,
I took over the post office.


5
00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:30.110
I passed my interview, so, yeah,
I was given the position.


6
00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:31.710
And everything was perfect.

7
00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:36.190
We had a group of pensioners
who would come in


8
00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:38.030
to get their pension every week.

9
00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.030
Very much part of a community.

10
00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.950
28p, please, love.
How much?


11
00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:46.830
You do get to know your locals.

12
00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:49.630
We'd have a good banter,
a good laugh with all the customers.


13
00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:51.470
It was really good.

14
00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:53.670
You're not only their postmaster.

15
00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.430
You were also an adviser to people.

16
00:00:57.710 --> 00:00:59.070
It was lovely.

17
00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.550
You felt like you were actually
the heart of the village.


18
00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:03.270
Morning. With you in a minute.
No rush.


19
00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.870
'It was idyllic.'

20
00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:09.310
I felt that I'd managed
to get myself a good position.


21
00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:10.910
As a postmistress, it's not easy.

22
00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:15.830
'The idea was it would be
my retirement business.'


23
00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:18.670
'I thought I was gonna
spend the rest of my life there.'


24
00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:22.030
But I didn't know
what was ahead of me.


25
00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:23.990
I went through hell.

26
00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:28.070
'It was diabolical.'

27
00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:30.110
Something had to be done about it.

28
00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:43.430
'Look, Alan!'

29
00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:45.950
'Look what we did,
look what you did!'


30
00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:48.230
'Should the Post Office bosses
go to prison, too?'


31
00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:49.590
'No. No, no.

32
00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:52.310
'Hit them in their pockets.'

33
00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:54.110
Hit them in their pockets.

34
00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:55.910
That's what you want to do.

35
00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:58.350
That's... That's what's gonna
hurt them.


36
00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:01.150
This is the story
of a saga that began


37
00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:03.670
nearly 25 years ago.

38
00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:05.390
We were not mad, were we?

39
00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:07.190
Dealing with Post Office
has been harder


40
00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:08.750
than dealing with the mafia.

41
00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:10.350
It's like fighting a steam roller.

42
00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:13.910
A group of subpostmasters
from all over the UK


43
00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:17.710
fought to expose one of the widest
miscarriages of justice


44
00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:19.030
in British legal history.

45
00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:22.110
We want answers now
to know who's actually done this


46
00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:24.990
to so many people, and why.

47
00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:30.990
'There begins
the long chain of accounting,


48
00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:34.190
'and every ha'penny
of every transaction accounted for.'


49
00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:38.790
The Post Office was established
in 1660,


50
00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:42.910
and had always used paper and pen
to balance the books.


51
00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:49.310
But in 1999, management introduced
something completely new...


52
00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:55.190
..a computer system called Horizon.

53
00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:58.150
It was the biggest IT roll-out
in Europe.


54
00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:02.550
The Post Office connected 40,000
terminals across the country


55
00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:05.030
to one central hub.

56
00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:07.710
'An engineer arrived.'

57
00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:10.030
He screwed it on the desk,
and I asked him what it was,


58
00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:12.510
and he goes, "That's Horizon.

59
00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:15.750
"It's going live shortly,
you'll hear all about it."


60
00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:19.510
It was great,
I was really enthusiastic.


61
00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:23.950
I'd been involved with developing
bespoke software packages


62
00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:26.470
where I'd worked before,
and I was all for it.


63
00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:31.710
Basically, I never had a problem
balancing until that was installed,


64
00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:34.510
and then a couple of months
after that,


65
00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:37.110
I had a very big shortfall
at the end of the week.


66
00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:40.350
It said I was minus £2,000.

67
00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:46.030
Just overnight,
£11,000 of stamps had gone missing.


68
00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:50.230
I suddenly found
I had £6,000 shortfall,


69
00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:52.390
and I couldn't understand
where that had gone.


70
00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:54.470
That was a ridiculous amount.

71
00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:58.350
There was no way of going back
and checking stuff


72
00:03:58.350 --> 00:03:59.710
like you did with the paper,

73
00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:02.630
cos once you pressed that button,
it had gone.


74
00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:08.750
I rang the help desk,

75
00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:11.310
and they told me
to do various things,


76
00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:14.110
which doubled the shortfall
to minus £4,000.


77
00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:15.710
When I rang the helpline,

78
00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:19.630
I was told that there was
nobody else having these problems.


79
00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:21.950
Oh, yes, the helpline
was telling you,


80
00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:24.070
"Nobody else has got a problem.

81
00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:25.590
"You're the only one."

82
00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:27.710
"You're the only one
this is happening to."


83
00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:30.590
"You're the only one."
That's what they kept saying.


84
00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:34.710
Then I started feeling
like I was going mad.


85
00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:38.510
I knew I wasn't computer-literate,
but I wasn't stupid either.


86
00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:41.230
In the end,
you were totally confused,


87
00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:42.750
and nothing was done.

88
00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:47.830
Under the terms of their contracts,

89
00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:52.230
the 20,000 subpostmasters
were liable for any shortfall,


90
00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:54.030
whatever the cause.

91
00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:58.630
When it got to about £9,000 short,

92
00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:02.550
I told my parents and my husband,
and I said,


93
00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:04.670
"Can we re-mortgage
and put the money in?


94
00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:06.670
"Cos I've got no idea
what's happening,


95
00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:09.030
"but I've got to make it good."

96
00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:11.110
My mum went down
to the building society


97
00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:12.430
and drew it out,

98
00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:15.390
and we put it into -
the money into the safe.


99
00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:19.030
Every week, I was
putting money in myself.


100
00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:23.550
So, we basically went through
the cash until it all ran out


101
00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:26.350
to try and make up the balance
every day.


102
00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:28.190
It was just up and down,
up and down.


103
00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:29.630
It was never, ever right.

104
00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:32.710
And on the end of the month when
we had to do the main balance...


105
00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:37.390
..that's when it all
used to come out, like...


106
00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:39.670
Where's this money gone?

107
00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:41.110
And the amount kept growing,

108
00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:44.430
so I then didn't say anything.

109
00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:48.350
I kept quiet and let it grow
to £36,000.


110
00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:50.870
Terrified of what was gonna happen.

111
00:05:57.710 --> 00:05:59.390
In North Wales,

112
00:05:59.390 --> 00:06:03.270
one subpostmaster
took a different approach.


113
00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:09.830
I had £1,000 of shortfall,

114
00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:12.350
and I've never been
accepting the figure


115
00:06:12.350 --> 00:06:14.550
that Horizon had
thrown up each week.


116
00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:16.550
Because I always felt
that if I cleared it,


117
00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:20.390
I was accepting
the Horizon system's figures.


118
00:06:20.390 --> 00:06:22.750
And I wasn't prepared to do that.

119
00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:25.030
Eventually,
they got round to telling me


120
00:06:25.030 --> 00:06:27.630
I had to do it or else.

121
00:06:27.630 --> 00:06:31.870
And I said, "I won't do it, not
until I have access to the system."


122
00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:36.190
And eventually, they decided
just to terminate my contract


123
00:06:36.190 --> 00:06:39.870
without giving me any reason,
and that was it.


124
00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:42.670
So, they walked off
with my life savings


125
00:06:42.670 --> 00:06:45.870
and they decided to give
my post office to somebody else.


126
00:06:47.750 --> 00:06:50.550
Horizon just created
a whole batch of worry,


127
00:06:50.550 --> 00:06:51.950
not just for me,

128
00:06:51.950 --> 00:06:54.630
but for subpostmasters
all over the country.


129
00:07:08.110 --> 00:07:12.510
I shall probably clean
at least till I'm 70-ish.


130
00:07:13.590 --> 00:07:18.670
I'm resigned to the fact
that I only have the state pension,


131
00:07:18.670 --> 00:07:24.510
and unless I sell my house,
I need to keep working.


132
00:07:29.470 --> 00:07:33.310
The Post Office used
their sweeping powers


133
00:07:33.310 --> 00:07:36.470
to bring private prosecutions
against their own employees.


134
00:07:36.470 --> 00:07:38.750
In 2003,

135
00:07:38.750 --> 00:07:42.830
they went after Jo for the money
they said she'd stolen.


136
00:07:42.830 --> 00:07:45.110
I was originally charged
with theft,


137
00:07:45.110 --> 00:07:46.550
and I pleaded not guilty.

138
00:07:46.550 --> 00:07:49.150
And we almost got to trial,

139
00:07:49.150 --> 00:07:52.230
and they offered up a plea bargain
at the 11th hour,


140
00:07:52.230 --> 00:07:55.030
And said, "Well, if you plead guilty
to false accounting,


141
00:07:55.030 --> 00:07:58.910
"we'll drop the theft charge,
provided you repay the money."


142
00:07:58.910 --> 00:08:01.830
That meant Jo was forced to borrow

143
00:08:01.830 --> 00:08:06.870
in order to pay back the £36,000
the computer said was missing.


144
00:08:08.190 --> 00:08:11.950
I could only raise £30,000
on the house,


145
00:08:11.950 --> 00:08:14.190
so we had a village meeting.

146
00:08:14.190 --> 00:08:16.470
And I had to explain to everybody

147
00:08:16.470 --> 00:08:19.550
that I was in trouble
in the Post Office.


148
00:08:19.550 --> 00:08:22.830
And someone put up their hand
and they said,


149
00:08:22.830 --> 00:08:25.310
cos it was November, they said,

150
00:08:25.310 --> 00:08:28.630
"Well, couldn't Jo have
an early Christmas present?"


151
00:08:28.630 --> 00:08:31.190
And from the moment I told them,

152
00:08:31.190 --> 00:08:34.910
I thought they were all gonna think
I'd stolen money, and they didn't,


153
00:08:34.910 --> 00:08:38.230
it was quite the opposite,
and, erm... yeah.


154
00:08:38.230 --> 00:08:40.190
It was very humbling.

155
00:08:40.190 --> 00:08:45.070
Literally thousands of pounds
went through the letterbox.


156
00:08:45.070 --> 00:08:49.830
I think we'd reached it
in about two weeks, and... Yeah.


157
00:08:49.830 --> 00:08:52.070
Wow.
My village.


158
00:08:58.510 --> 00:09:02.190
When she went to court,
the village showed up again.


159
00:09:03.830 --> 00:09:05.070
I just looked at the judge,

160
00:09:05.070 --> 00:09:08.070
and he goes, "Well I'm not
considering a custodial sentence."


161
00:09:08.070 --> 00:09:10.350
Well, I was literally...

162
00:09:10.350 --> 00:09:12.950
Just the tears were
streaming down my face.


163
00:09:14.230 --> 00:09:18.510
Jo was sentenced
to a 12-month supervision order.


164
00:09:22.070 --> 00:09:26.150
But there were other people whose
ordeals left an even greater mark.


165
00:09:29.950 --> 00:09:32.270
'We had a lot
of happy memories here.'


166
00:09:33.670 --> 00:09:36.430
Especially when the children
used to come off the bus.


167
00:09:36.430 --> 00:09:38.950
We used to look forward
to seeing them after school.


168
00:09:38.950 --> 00:09:41.630
They used to come running
across this road.


169
00:09:41.630 --> 00:09:43.190
Yeah.

170
00:09:43.190 --> 00:09:45.590
'They enjoyed being here as well.

171
00:09:45.590 --> 00:09:47.670
'Would've handed it over to them.

172
00:09:49.550 --> 00:09:50.990
'A lot of happy memories.'

173
00:09:52.790 --> 00:09:54.390
But they all got broken.

174
00:09:55.950 --> 00:10:02.990
In 2009, the Post Office charged
Jess with the theft of £5,000.


175
00:10:02.990 --> 00:10:06.350
And her face was splashed
across the local papers.


176
00:10:07.990 --> 00:10:10.790
Family members actually went
round to the shops, local shops,


177
00:10:10.790 --> 00:10:13.910
and gathered as many papers
as they could.


178
00:10:13.910 --> 00:10:18.030
It was also in one
of the Punjabi papers as well.


179
00:10:18.030 --> 00:10:23.190
So, basically, everybody read
that story and pointed fingers.


180
00:10:25.590 --> 00:10:28.350
We had somebody come in
and spit on the floor as well.


181
00:10:29.630 --> 00:10:31.750
We had car windows broken.

182
00:10:31.750 --> 00:10:36.550
You know, they did try and,
like, traumatise us, really.


183
00:10:39.390 --> 00:10:42.150
I got this feeling
that everybody else is thinking


184
00:10:42.150 --> 00:10:44.190
that "she's a thief".

185
00:10:44.190 --> 00:10:48.670
And thinking about it day and night,
day and night.


186
00:10:48.670 --> 00:10:50.270
I just wanted to end my life.

187
00:10:59.910 --> 00:11:01.910
I'm showing you the box.

188
00:11:03.230 --> 00:11:05.030
We can cross quickly.

189
00:11:06.350 --> 00:11:08.990
And this is where
the Post Office was.


190
00:11:08.990 --> 00:11:12.830
Noel Thomas became a postman
at the age of 17.


191
00:11:12.830 --> 00:11:16.070
In 2005, when his nightmare began,

192
00:11:16.070 --> 00:11:18.910
he had only ever worked
for the Post Office.


193
00:11:18.910 --> 00:11:21.190
There we are.

194
00:11:21.190 --> 00:11:24.150
We're by the box
which was the Post Office


195
00:11:24.150 --> 00:11:30.310
that my wife and I ran for,
erm, 36 years.


196
00:11:31.510 --> 00:11:35.870
You know, it was a betrayal,
wasn't it, when we lost this?


197
00:11:37.590 --> 00:11:40.350
At half past seven,
there was a knock on the door,


198
00:11:40.350 --> 00:11:44.110
and, er, there was a lady
and a gentleman in the door,


199
00:11:44.110 --> 00:11:48.150
and said they were Post Office
auditors, and so I let them in,


200
00:11:48.150 --> 00:11:52.390
made them a cup of tea, and I told
them straightaway that I was,


201
00:11:52.390 --> 00:11:58.390
erm, about £52,000 down,
so all hell let loose.


202
00:12:00.830 --> 00:12:04.790
Noel was arrested and questioned
at a police station.


203
00:12:06.350 --> 00:12:09.910
She was just, "Where was the money?
Where was the money?


204
00:12:09.910 --> 00:12:11.190
"And what did you do with it?"

205
00:12:11.190 --> 00:12:13.750
You know,
it was really aggressive.


206
00:12:15.390 --> 00:12:17.510
Then the Post Office did to Noel

207
00:12:17.510 --> 00:12:20.510
what they did
to many other subpostmasters.


208
00:12:20.510 --> 00:12:22.870
They offered
to drop the theft charge


209
00:12:22.870 --> 00:12:26.350
if he agreed to plead guilty
to false accounting.


210
00:12:29.630 --> 00:12:32.910
I remember me telling him,
"Will it keep me out of jail?"


211
00:12:32.910 --> 00:12:34.390
And he said, "Yes."

212
00:12:41.550 --> 00:12:44.830
But unfortunately,
when I went into court,


213
00:12:44.830 --> 00:12:48.150
er, the judge, erm,
came to his sentencing words,


214
00:12:48.150 --> 00:12:53.310
and he said, erm, "Nine months,"
and he sort of paused.


215
00:12:53.310 --> 00:12:57.390
And I waited
for a suspended sentence.


216
00:12:57.390 --> 00:13:00.710
But he said, erm, "Take him down."

217
00:13:02.110 --> 00:13:04.910
'I'd been a councillor,
I'd been a postmaster,


218
00:13:04.910 --> 00:13:08.150
'I'd been a postman and,
er, highly thought of.'


219
00:13:10.110 --> 00:13:13.230
All of a sudden, er,
it was all taken away from me,


220
00:13:13.230 --> 00:13:16.230
like taking a mat
from under your feet, if you like.


221
00:13:19.350 --> 00:13:21.350
It was bloody horrible.

222
00:13:38.590 --> 00:13:41.270
'My journalistic life
has been dominated by this.'


223
00:13:41.270 --> 00:13:43.550
I mean, it's the biggest story
I've worked on.


224
00:13:43.550 --> 00:13:45.750
It's probably the biggest story
I'll ever work on.


225
00:13:47.790 --> 00:13:52.190
In 2009, the story hadn't
hit the press yet.


226
00:13:52.190 --> 00:13:55.470
Social media was in its infancy.

227
00:13:55.470 --> 00:13:59.230
Even though many subpostmasters
were being prosecuted,


228
00:13:59.230 --> 00:14:02.950
each one of them thought
they were the only one.


229
00:14:04.270 --> 00:14:07.030
But that was about to change.

230
00:14:07.030 --> 00:14:09.710
This particular article began

231
00:14:09.710 --> 00:14:13.990
because we were contacted by
a subpostmaster about his problems.


232
00:14:13.990 --> 00:14:16.470
Often when you get contacted
by a single person,


233
00:14:16.470 --> 00:14:17.870
it's very hard to stand up a story.

234
00:14:17.870 --> 00:14:20.950
But one of my former colleagues,
an alarm bell rang in his head,


235
00:14:20.950 --> 00:14:22.950
and he thought,
"I've heard this before."


236
00:14:22.950 --> 00:14:25.110
And I think
it was four years earlier,


237
00:14:25.110 --> 00:14:29.030
he'd been contacted by Alan Bates,
who'd had the same problems.


238
00:14:29.030 --> 00:14:31.870
Then they started
to build up a picture.


239
00:14:31.870 --> 00:14:33.230
People having the same problems,

240
00:14:33.230 --> 00:14:35.550
people being told the same thing
from the Post Office,


241
00:14:35.550 --> 00:14:38.190
which eventually led to them
gathering information


242
00:14:38.190 --> 00:14:41.310
about four other subpostmasters
and doing this first story.


243
00:14:41.310 --> 00:14:44.430
But we were so worried
about legal action.


244
00:14:44.430 --> 00:14:46.030
We didn't publish it for a year.

245
00:14:47.310 --> 00:14:50.630
This was the response
from the Post Office.


246
00:15:02.750 --> 00:15:04.430
That was an outright lie.

247
00:15:04.430 --> 00:15:07.310
We knew of seven postmasters
who had complained,


248
00:15:07.310 --> 00:15:09.590
and also, we know that computers
have problems,


249
00:15:09.590 --> 00:15:10.830
especially complex systems.

250
00:15:11.950 --> 00:15:15.550
Suddenly,
subpostmasters who had problems


251
00:15:15.550 --> 00:15:18.310
were seeing the story,
contacting each other,


252
00:15:18.310 --> 00:15:20.150
which then started the campaign.

253
00:15:25.590 --> 00:15:27.430
That's the seven
from Computer Weekly,


254
00:15:27.430 --> 00:15:31.590
then there's, er,
two that came via our website.


255
00:15:31.590 --> 00:15:33.630
But where are all the others?

256
00:15:33.630 --> 00:15:36.590
So we thought, "Let's see
if we can get people together,


257
00:15:36.590 --> 00:15:39.910
"and let's see
how big the problem actually is."


258
00:15:39.910 --> 00:15:41.390
Somewhere central.

259
00:15:44.150 --> 00:15:47.310
Fenny...
Compton.


260
00:15:51.910 --> 00:15:55.030
We didn't know if anyone
was gonna turn up, but, er,


261
00:15:55.030 --> 00:15:57.630
slowly but surely, people turned up.

262
00:16:00.790 --> 00:16:06.430
We all sat round in a circle
telling our stories,


263
00:16:06.430 --> 00:16:10.510
and you almost felt embarrassed
about having to say,


264
00:16:10.510 --> 00:16:14.030
"Oh, I'm Jo,
and I've been done for £36,000."


265
00:16:14.030 --> 00:16:18.470
But I realised, "Oh, my God,
we're all exactly the same."


266
00:16:18.470 --> 00:16:20.310
That's when the stories...

267
00:16:20.310 --> 00:16:23.470
A jigsaw started coming together,
if you know what I mean.


268
00:16:23.470 --> 00:16:26.550
And we'd all had our lives
completely tipped upside down.


269
00:16:26.550 --> 00:16:30.910
People had been losing houses,
cashing in their pensions,


270
00:16:30.910 --> 00:16:33.310
they'd been borrowing money
off relatives,


271
00:16:33.310 --> 00:16:35.110
marriages were splitting up.

272
00:16:36.790 --> 00:16:40.510
We all looked like
we'd been in a war


273
00:16:40.510 --> 00:16:43.830
and just weary with the stress
that we'd been put through,


274
00:16:43.830 --> 00:16:45.430
and the shame of it.

275
00:16:45.430 --> 00:16:47.950
It was diabolical.

276
00:16:47.950 --> 00:16:52.350
But that's when we knew
something had to be done about it.


277
00:16:53.550 --> 00:16:56.910
And that's when we picked
Alan Bates as chairman.


278
00:16:56.910 --> 00:16:58.990
That was really
the start of everything,


279
00:16:58.990 --> 00:17:00.790
and that's where the JFSA,

280
00:17:00.790 --> 00:17:04.670
Justice For Subpostmasters Alliance,
was born.


281
00:17:04.670 --> 00:17:09.750
It was like a switch got turned,
and the Post Office was the enemy.


282
00:17:11.070 --> 00:17:15.590
They'd gone from this trusted brand
to a monster.


283
00:17:15.590 --> 00:17:18.110
And it was like,
"We are gonna get them."


284
00:17:40.790 --> 00:17:43.910
This is the view I have of him
most of the time.


285
00:17:43.910 --> 00:17:46.550
I mean, most mornings,
this is what he's doing,


286
00:17:46.550 --> 00:17:49.230
and as you can see,
he's still in his dressing gown.


287
00:17:52.190 --> 00:17:55.910
For the past 20 years,
Alan and his partner, Suzanne,


288
00:17:55.910 --> 00:17:59.550
have had their lives dominated
by one thing.


289
00:17:59.550 --> 00:18:03.670
The whole of this Post Office issue
has, er, turned into probably


290
00:18:03.670 --> 00:18:07.550
the worst unpaid full-time job
you can imagine.


291
00:18:10.230 --> 00:18:12.550
I'm gonna do the cat,

292
00:18:12.550 --> 00:18:15.150
and I'll have her sitting down
on the carpet here,


293
00:18:15.150 --> 00:18:16.390
looking up at him as if to say,

294
00:18:16.390 --> 00:18:18.550
"Well, when are you gonna finish,
you know?


295
00:18:18.550 --> 00:18:20.550
"When are you gonna take a break?"

296
00:18:22.510 --> 00:18:27.710
Because you are hearing stories
of such distress and family ruin.


297
00:18:27.710 --> 00:18:31.750
So you couldn't give up
working on something like this


298
00:18:31.750 --> 00:18:34.430
because it developed
a life of its own.


299
00:18:34.430 --> 00:18:36.470
And it wasn't just me.

300
00:18:36.470 --> 00:18:38.950
Other people were
chasing their own MPs.


301
00:18:43.030 --> 00:18:46.110
The good thing about being an MP is,

302
00:18:46.110 --> 00:18:50.470
if you contact someone like
the Chairman of the Post Office


303
00:18:50.470 --> 00:18:53.150
and say, "I'd like to meet you
to talk this through,"


304
00:18:53.150 --> 00:18:55.190
they tend to respond.

305
00:18:55.190 --> 00:18:58.110
Erm, Mrs Hamilton?
That's me.


306
00:18:58.110 --> 00:19:00.830
James Arbuthnot.
Thank you for coming.


307
00:19:00.830 --> 00:19:04.510
'He came out to the shop
and met my parents.'


308
00:19:04.510 --> 00:19:08.070
And he was just
a thoroughly decent guy.


309
00:19:08.070 --> 00:19:10.950
There are two other cases
in my constituency alone.


310
00:19:10.950 --> 00:19:13.710
Wow, really?
It's very odd, isn't it?


311
00:19:13.710 --> 00:19:17.070
I thought, "There's something
obviously not right."


312
00:19:17.070 --> 00:19:19.750
'And so I went to see

313
00:19:19.750 --> 00:19:23.150
'the then Chief Executive
of the Post Office, Paula Vennells.'


314
00:19:24.510 --> 00:19:26.950
We're the ones who are going
to keep the Post Office


315
00:19:26.950 --> 00:19:30.310
as relevant and as loved
and as trusted in the communities


316
00:19:30.310 --> 00:19:32.150
that it is today.

317
00:19:32.150 --> 00:19:36.670
Paula Vennells was hired
by the Post Office in 2007.


318
00:19:36.670 --> 00:19:40.350
By 2012, she'd worked her way up
to the top job,


319
00:19:40.350 --> 00:19:43.270
and used her in-house PR

320
00:19:43.270 --> 00:19:46.310
to highlight her commitment
to subpostmasters.


321
00:19:46.310 --> 00:19:48.550
I say this very specifically,
actually,


322
00:19:48.550 --> 00:19:50.150
putting our subpostmasters

323
00:19:50.150 --> 00:19:53.390
and the colleagues
who work in our agency branches


324
00:19:53.390 --> 00:19:55.990
right at the forefront
of everything we think about.


325
00:19:58.550 --> 00:20:03.150
It was Paula Vennells who suggested
that what we needed


326
00:20:03.150 --> 00:20:07.510
was forensic accountants
to go into the allegations,


327
00:20:07.510 --> 00:20:10.870
and we said,
"That's exactly what we need.


328
00:20:10.870 --> 00:20:12.870
"Who would you recommend?"

329
00:20:14.470 --> 00:20:18.470
Ron Warmington runs Second Sight.

330
00:20:18.470 --> 00:20:20.070
I was Head of Investigations

331
00:20:20.070 --> 00:20:22.190
for one of the world's biggest banks
for many years.


332
00:20:22.190 --> 00:20:23.670
And now I'm meant to be retired.

333
00:20:23.670 --> 00:20:26.110
The only reason I'm not retired
is because of this case.


334
00:20:27.510 --> 00:20:31.630
Ron's investigation was paid for
by the Post Office itself.


335
00:20:33.710 --> 00:20:37.310
But, obviously, we had
very serious concerns that


336
00:20:37.310 --> 00:20:38.830
it's gonna be a bit of a whitewash.

337
00:20:39.990 --> 00:20:45.350
So Alan and the MPs brought in
their own top forensic accountant.


338
00:20:45.350 --> 00:20:48.910
Kay Linnell flew at me
like a tigress.


339
00:20:48.910 --> 00:20:51.830
I don't doubt
your paper qualifications,


340
00:20:51.830 --> 00:20:55.750
I have them here in front of me,
but I see nothing to persuade me


341
00:20:55.750 --> 00:20:59.070
that Second Sight
is remotely capable


342
00:20:59.070 --> 00:21:01.390
of producing
a truly independent report.


343
00:21:01.390 --> 00:21:05.790
Clearly suspecting that either
we were hired to do a whitewash


344
00:21:05.790 --> 00:21:08.430
or that
we'd be hopelessly incompetent -


345
00:21:08.430 --> 00:21:09.870
probably, she thought both.

346
00:21:10.870 --> 00:21:13.790
The involvement
with the Post Office


347
00:21:13.790 --> 00:21:17.070
started with Jo Hamilton,
my local subpostmistress.


348
00:21:17.070 --> 00:21:20.630
Kay volunteered
to help the subpostmasters.


349
00:21:20.630 --> 00:21:23.110
I had no idea
how long it would take,


350
00:21:23.110 --> 00:21:26.670
but I knew we had a room of people
who had lost everything


351
00:21:26.670 --> 00:21:28.510
or were losing everything,

352
00:21:28.510 --> 00:21:32.510
and people were still being
prosecuted almost on a daily basis.


353
00:21:32.510 --> 00:21:34.910
And I knew we had to do something

354
00:21:34.910 --> 00:21:38.310
to try and stop the tide
or raise the profile.


355
00:21:40.510 --> 00:21:44.390
She clearly was exactly
the person we needed.


356
00:21:44.390 --> 00:21:47.070
Having had that meeting
with Ron and Ian,


357
00:21:47.070 --> 00:21:49.030
which I suspect they will remember,

358
00:21:49.030 --> 00:21:52.070
I was satisfied
they would do an independent job.


359
00:21:58.030 --> 00:22:02.190
Ron's team began their investigation
in 2012.


360
00:22:02.190 --> 00:22:04.790
At that time,
the Post Office continued


361
00:22:04.790 --> 00:22:07.270
to prosecute subpostmasters.

362
00:22:11.470 --> 00:22:14.870
Basically, I was told I was going
to get two years in prison.


363
00:22:17.550 --> 00:22:18.990
In the West Midlands,

364
00:22:18.990 --> 00:22:22.910
Jess was convinced a faulty PIN pad
on her Horizon terminal


365
00:22:22.910 --> 00:22:25.270
had caused the shortfall.

366
00:22:25.270 --> 00:22:29.750
And she pleaded not guilty to theft.

367
00:22:29.750 --> 00:22:33.230
But the case dragged on
for three years.


368
00:22:35.110 --> 00:22:37.990
Went to numerous courts
up and down the country.


369
00:22:37.990 --> 00:22:39.990
In Wolverhampton Crown Court,

370
00:22:39.990 --> 00:22:41.910
the judge said,
"Where's the PIN pad?"


371
00:22:41.910 --> 00:22:44.150
And the Post Office said,

372
00:22:44.150 --> 00:22:47.070
"The PIN pad's been taken away
for repair."


373
00:22:47.070 --> 00:22:49.190
And so the judge said, "Well...

374
00:22:49.190 --> 00:22:51.790
"If it's gone for repair,
it was faulty."


375
00:22:51.790 --> 00:22:55.310
That's when it all got thrown out,
basically.


376
00:22:56.550 --> 00:23:00.110
By then, the damage had been done.

377
00:23:00.110 --> 00:23:02.150
The stress that we'd been through,

378
00:23:02.150 --> 00:23:06.750
the trauma that we'd been through,
lied to, bullied,


379
00:23:06.750 --> 00:23:09.550
it all mounted up,
and I ended up in hospital.


380
00:23:09.550 --> 00:23:11.710
And I
-I went to commit suicide.

381
00:23:16.190 --> 00:23:18.750
I even tried to commit suicide
in hospital.


382
00:23:23.790 --> 00:23:25.430
Jess was so ill,

383
00:23:25.430 --> 00:23:29.310
the doctors decided to treat her
with electroconvulsive therapy.


384
00:23:32.670 --> 00:23:34.670
All I remember
is they used to put this...


385
00:23:34.670 --> 00:23:36.950
Like a helmet type thing on my head.

386
00:23:36.950 --> 00:23:39.190
And the shockwaves
were going through my brain.


387
00:23:39.190 --> 00:23:42.830
So I had... I think I had

388
00:23:46.030 --> 00:23:48.430
After that, I lost all my memory.

389
00:23:50.990 --> 00:23:54.070
I don't remember anything
from my childhood.


390
00:23:55.950 --> 00:23:58.590
I couldn't sleep
unless I had sleeping tablets.


391
00:23:58.590 --> 00:24:01.110
Put me on numerous medication...

392
00:24:03.230 --> 00:24:05.190
..which I'm still on today.

393
00:24:05.190 --> 00:24:08.070
And it's all down
to the Post Office.


394
00:24:16.390 --> 00:24:19.790
During Ron's investigation,
it became clear


395
00:24:19.790 --> 00:24:23.310
the Post Office had
some serious questions to answer.


396
00:24:25.470 --> 00:24:29.510
There were documents which
looked extremely suspicious,


397
00:24:29.510 --> 00:24:33.750
very poor investigative processes
that were directed


398
00:24:33.750 --> 00:24:37.790
blatantly at simply
recovering assets


399
00:24:37.790 --> 00:24:42.550
by trying to get
the easiest conviction possible,


400
00:24:42.550 --> 00:24:44.390
which generally
was false accounting,


401
00:24:44.390 --> 00:24:50.590
using as a cudgel,
bluffing that they had a theft case.


402
00:24:52.710 --> 00:24:55.950
I'm pretty used to being able
to detect crooks.


403
00:24:55.950 --> 00:24:57.590
But when I really dug deeper,

404
00:24:57.590 --> 00:24:59.830
I didn't find any evidence
of theft at all.


405
00:25:08.630 --> 00:25:11.750
We didn't know whether
the investigation would work,


406
00:25:11.750 --> 00:25:15.790
but the very fact that they had
access to Post Office's data,


407
00:25:15.790 --> 00:25:17.870
erm, seemed quite promising.

408
00:25:17.870 --> 00:25:21.270
And at that time, we did understand

409
00:25:21.270 --> 00:25:25.030
that Post Office... did actually
want to get to the truth.


410
00:25:26.590 --> 00:25:28.430
I felt we were getting somewhere.

411
00:25:30.430 --> 00:25:35.470
Ha, little did I know
how long the journey was gonna be.


412
00:25:48.630 --> 00:25:53.710
Remote access to the system
was always a huge concern.


413
00:25:53.710 --> 00:25:55.470
And the reason why

414
00:25:55.470 --> 00:26:00.550
was it meant that someone else
could be accessing your accounts


415
00:26:00.550 --> 00:26:04.470
on your counter in your Post Office,
and you did not know about it.


416
00:26:09.270 --> 00:26:12.430
When the Post Office rolled out
their new computer system,


417
00:26:12.430 --> 00:26:17.630
every subpostmaster's computer
was hard-wired to a central hub.


418
00:26:17.630 --> 00:26:20.430
This was located at the headquarters
of the company


419
00:26:20.430 --> 00:26:24.510
who designed and managed Horizon,
Fujitsu.


420
00:26:26.790 --> 00:26:29.030
Post Office were quite adamant
that no-one else


421
00:26:29.030 --> 00:26:33.470
could ever access the systems
or do anything like this at all.


422
00:26:33.470 --> 00:26:34.750
And that was something

423
00:26:34.750 --> 00:26:37.630
that we wanted Second Sight
to prove had occurred,


424
00:26:37.630 --> 00:26:38.990
or how it had occurred.

425
00:26:45.230 --> 00:26:49.710
I went to Fujitsu headquarters
with the intention of helping


426
00:26:49.710 --> 00:26:51.790
and looking at the system,

427
00:26:51.790 --> 00:26:56.630
and how we accounted for
bureau de change within branches.


428
00:26:58.910 --> 00:27:01.190
Er, Michael Rudkin
to see George Delph.


429
00:27:01.190 --> 00:27:03.470
That was the purpose of my visit.

430
00:27:05.630 --> 00:27:08.430
'I arrived, as scheduled,
about ten o'clock in the morning.'


431
00:27:08.430 --> 00:27:10.510
Cheers.
'Went into reception.'


432
00:27:10.510 --> 00:27:13.190
Mr Rudkin, George Delph, hi.

433
00:27:13.190 --> 00:27:15.910
'Within a few minutes,
my chaperone arrived.'


434
00:27:15.910 --> 00:27:19.750
I was really taken aback
by the number of security doors


435
00:27:19.750 --> 00:27:21.150
that we had to pass through.

436
00:27:22.870 --> 00:27:27.270
I was encouraged to enter into
the boiler room by my chaperone.


437
00:27:27.270 --> 00:27:30.990
And in doing so, I then recognised
to the right-hand side of me,


438
00:27:30.990 --> 00:27:34.670
there's two Horizon terminals
on this workbench.


439
00:27:34.670 --> 00:27:38.710
One of the guys not happy with
my presence gets up and walks out.


440
00:27:38.710 --> 00:27:40.470
My chaperone said,

441
00:27:40.470 --> 00:27:45.230
"This is my covert operations team
and my covert operations room."


442
00:27:45.230 --> 00:27:48.270
He proceeded to enter into
this particular account,


443
00:27:48.270 --> 00:27:51.310
and he started, er,
altering figures,


444
00:27:51.310 --> 00:27:54.350
which I said to him,
"Is this real-time?"


445
00:27:54.350 --> 00:27:55.910
He says,
"Look, I'll just prove it."


446
00:27:55.910 --> 00:27:59.230
He says, "I'll alter the Euro
figures in this branch's accounts."


447
00:27:59.230 --> 00:28:04.470
You're inside some subpostmaster's
Horizon, and he doesn't know?


448
00:28:04.470 --> 00:28:06.270
In total disbelief, I said,

449
00:28:06.270 --> 00:28:09.430
"Are you sure you can
alter these figures in real time?"


450
00:28:09.430 --> 00:28:11.270
And he said, "Yes."

451
00:28:11.270 --> 00:28:13.470
I said,
"Well, for your information..."


452
00:28:13.470 --> 00:28:16.430
I've been telling my members
for years,


453
00:28:16.430 --> 00:28:19.110
no-one else has access
to their branch accounts.


454
00:28:19.110 --> 00:28:23.150
' "And here you are proving
that you've got remote access." '


455
00:28:23.150 --> 00:28:26.830
At which there was an immediate look
of disdain on his face,


456
00:28:26.830 --> 00:28:28.270
and then ushered me out,

457
00:28:28.270 --> 00:28:30.750
and more or less thrown out
as though I was...


458
00:28:32.510 --> 00:28:33.550
..a thief.

459
00:28:35.030 --> 00:28:38.710
I said to Michael, "Your story
is really, really interesting.


460
00:28:38.710 --> 00:28:41.710
"But Post Office, of course,

461
00:28:41.710 --> 00:28:44.630
"will ask for evidence
to support what you're saying.


462
00:28:44.630 --> 00:28:47.430
"So we need to find
the visitors book."


463
00:28:47.430 --> 00:28:51.590
The so-called visitors book
that I signed,


464
00:28:51.590 --> 00:28:55.790
ironically, is the only
visitors book that's disappeared.


465
00:28:55.790 --> 00:29:00.870
"So, Michael, you need to have
a look through your email records


466
00:29:00.870 --> 00:29:03.950
"to see if you can find the
invitation that came through to you,


467
00:29:03.950 --> 00:29:07.390
"so get to it, Michael,
I need it, and I need it quickly."


468
00:29:07.390 --> 00:29:09.630
I had a telephone conversation
with Ron.


469
00:29:09.630 --> 00:29:13.430
I said, "I have the evidence.
Are you in front of your computer?"


470
00:29:13.430 --> 00:29:15.350
He said, "Yes."

471
00:29:15.350 --> 00:29:17.870
I said, "Well,
I'm pressing send now." I did.


472
00:29:19.710 --> 00:29:21.870
The reply came back.

473
00:29:21.870 --> 00:29:26.710
"Oh, my effing good God.

474
00:29:26.710 --> 00:29:30.990
"They are now going to become
a hostage to fortune."


475
00:29:32.150 --> 00:29:35.430
The day after Michael's visit
to Fujitsu,


476
00:29:35.430 --> 00:29:38.070
Post Office officials
paid him a visit.


477
00:29:38.070 --> 00:29:40.990
What come as an even greater shock

478
00:29:40.990 --> 00:29:43.950
was the orders that then came
into my bedroom at 8:30


479
00:29:43.950 --> 00:29:47.990
that following morning,
sat on the edge of my bed, and said,


480
00:29:47.990 --> 00:29:50.950
"You've got a £44,000 shortage
in your office."


481
00:29:50.950 --> 00:29:52.950
My wife, Susan,
who's managing the branch,


482
00:29:52.950 --> 00:29:57.030
ended up being convicted
with 300 hours community service,


483
00:29:57.030 --> 00:29:59.830
electronically tagged
for six months.


484
00:29:59.830 --> 00:30:03.270
She had to live through
and endure that experience.


485
00:30:09.110 --> 00:30:14.950
In 2013, Second Sight
published their initial findings.


486
00:30:20.270 --> 00:30:23.870
With Ron's report
in the public domain,


487
00:30:23.870 --> 00:30:26.710
Post Office management
changed their approach.


488
00:30:28.310 --> 00:30:31.470
Paula Vennells rang me up to say,

489
00:30:31.470 --> 00:30:34.310
"What we're proposing
is a mediation scheme


490
00:30:34.310 --> 00:30:38.670
"between the subpostmasters
and the Post Office,


491
00:30:38.670 --> 00:30:42.350
"with a senior judge
as the mediator.


492
00:30:42.350 --> 00:30:46.070
"And that will be able to get
to the bottom of all these cases."


493
00:30:46.070 --> 00:30:49.150
And I said,
"Well, that sounds right and proper.


494
00:30:49.150 --> 00:30:50.710
"Let's go ahead with that."

495
00:30:56.670 --> 00:31:00.470
Alan put forward 150 cases
for the new scheme.


496
00:31:05.390 --> 00:31:10.030
The whole process was only meant
to take X amount of months in total.


497
00:31:10.030 --> 00:31:12.230
It was running into years.

498
00:31:12.230 --> 00:31:15.670
You're supposed to go to mediation
with a willingness to settle,


499
00:31:15.670 --> 00:31:18.470
but it appeared that the Post Office
was sending two lawyers


500
00:31:18.470 --> 00:31:19.750
who turned up and said,

501
00:31:19.750 --> 00:31:23.710
"You're out of time to make a claim,
it's over six years old. Forget it."


502
00:31:23.710 --> 00:31:25.950
I think they were actually
uncovering the real truth


503
00:31:25.950 --> 00:31:27.150
of what had been going on,

504
00:31:27.150 --> 00:31:29.310
and they didn't want
to come forward with it.


505
00:31:33.670 --> 00:31:37.030
The Post Office has spent
public money on a mediation scheme


506
00:31:37.030 --> 00:31:40.790
which they themselves
have set out to sabotage.


507
00:31:40.790 --> 00:31:43.270
In Westminster, 
James Arbuthnot

508
00:31:43.270 --> 00:31:46.790
was working hard to keep the case
in the public eye.


509
00:31:46.790 --> 00:31:50.990
And they've broken their word
to Members of Parliament


510
00:31:50.990 --> 00:31:54.030
in so many different respects
that it is frankly bewildering.


511
00:31:58.110 --> 00:32:01.510
If you could just introduce yourself
for voice transcription purposes.


512
00:32:01.510 --> 00:32:03.990
Paula Vennells,
Chief Executive of Post Office.


513
00:32:03.990 --> 00:32:07.310
And then Paula was called in
to face MPs.


514
00:32:07.310 --> 00:32:11.190
'People do not like appearing
in front of select committees.'


515
00:32:11.190 --> 00:32:15.670
Because the select committee
may get to the bottom of things


516
00:32:15.670 --> 00:32:18.470
that the witnesses may prefer
that they didn't.


517
00:32:18.470 --> 00:32:19.990
Before the hearing,

518
00:32:19.990 --> 00:32:24.470
Paula Vennells asked colleagues
to help clarify what she should say.


519
00:32:24.470 --> 00:32:26.390
Here we go.

520
00:32:26.390 --> 00:32:30.070
A copy of her email
has since come to light.


521
00:32:30.070 --> 00:32:32.590
"Urgent: Accessing Horizon.

522
00:32:32.590 --> 00:32:35.830
"Dear both, your help,
please, in prep for the SC,


523
00:32:35.830 --> 00:32:37.710
"the select committee hearing."

524
00:32:43.950 --> 00:32:46.110
That's obviously the question
she's being warned


525
00:32:46.110 --> 00:32:47.990
she's gonna have to answer.

526
00:33:06.390 --> 00:33:08.710
This is a system that works well,

527
00:33:08.710 --> 00:33:10.950
and it works well
for the vast majority of people.


528
00:33:10.950 --> 00:33:14.270
For those it doesn't work for,
we are doing our utmost.


529
00:33:14.270 --> 00:33:17.350
I've got Nadhim,
and then I've got Brian...


530
00:33:17.350 --> 00:33:21.550
The MPs wanted to know why
the Post Office had been obstructive


531
00:33:21.550 --> 00:33:24.830
during Second Sight's investigation.

532
00:33:24.830 --> 00:33:27.470
Paula, why don't you
give those files over?


533
00:33:27.470 --> 00:33:29.870
What's the problem?
Erm, so, I...


534
00:33:29.870 --> 00:33:32.190
I think the point I want
to pick up first, if I may...


535
00:33:32.190 --> 00:33:34.790
No, just...
No, answer my question first.


536
00:33:34.790 --> 00:33:37.430
Why won't you give Ian Henderson
those files? Why?


537
00:33:37.430 --> 00:33:39.510
We have...
As far as I'm aware, Mr Zahawi,


538
00:33:39.510 --> 00:33:42.470
we have shared whatever information
was appropriate on every single...


539
00:33:42.470 --> 00:33:44.110
That's not what
Ian Henderson's saying.


540
00:33:44.110 --> 00:33:46.110
It is the first time personally
I have heard that.


541
00:33:46.110 --> 00:33:47.910
You're the head of the organisation.

542
00:33:47.910 --> 00:33:49.630
Will you provide it? Yes or no?
Simple.


543
00:33:49.630 --> 00:33:51.670
I'm not prepared,
on behalf of the Post Office...


544
00:33:51.670 --> 00:33:53.550
Right, I've got my answer,
so you won't...


545
00:33:53.550 --> 00:33:56.390
No, you haven't got your answer,
you haven't heard a yes or no.


546
00:33:56.390 --> 00:33:58.470
I'm simply saying
that at the moment,


547
00:33:58.470 --> 00:34:00.710
I'm not able to answer
your question.


548
00:34:00.710 --> 00:34:03.270
'It was pointed out to her
time after time


549
00:34:03.270 --> 00:34:06.390
'that she was in charge
and the decisions were with her.'


550
00:34:06.390 --> 00:34:10.750
But it just seemed to wash over her.

551
00:34:10.750 --> 00:34:12.710
Well, this sounds like a shambles
to me.


552
00:34:12.710 --> 00:34:15.830
You came in here, opened by saying
the system's working beautifully.


553
00:34:15.830 --> 00:34:19.430
You now realise why you're in front
of the committee, is that right?


554
00:34:19.430 --> 00:34:22.350
The system... The reason...
Ian said...


555
00:34:22.350 --> 00:34:25.950
I just couldn't understand
why, even after that,


556
00:34:25.950 --> 00:34:29.430
she didn't take things on board
and actually be honest and own up


557
00:34:29.430 --> 00:34:31.230
and actually try and resolve it,

558
00:34:31.230 --> 00:34:33.030
which she should've done
far earlier.


559
00:34:33.030 --> 00:34:35.870
I'm very sorry
that I can't answer that. It's..


560
00:34:37.150 --> 00:34:41.030
When I listened to the evidence
from Paula Vennells...


561
00:34:42.470 --> 00:34:46.910
..I realised
what we were gonna be up against,


562
00:34:46.910 --> 00:34:48.750
and just what it looks like.

563
00:34:48.750 --> 00:34:50.990
I have been told that
we're providing information.


564
00:34:50.990 --> 00:34:55.070
It looks like
it's a massive corporate cover-up.


565
00:34:57.550 --> 00:35:00.990
Then, a few weeks after
the select committee hearing,


566
00:35:00.990 --> 00:35:04.590
the Post Office
changed their approach again.


567
00:35:04.590 --> 00:35:08.710
Post Office dynamited
the mediation working group


568
00:35:08.710 --> 00:35:10.190
and fired everybody.

569
00:35:10.190 --> 00:35:12.910
I think at that stage,

570
00:35:12.910 --> 00:35:19.030
she decided it was preferable
to cover up the injustice


571
00:35:19.030 --> 00:35:24.750
and to allow these subpostmasters
to go to the wall.


572
00:35:24.750 --> 00:35:27.150
And I think that's shocking.

573
00:35:33.310 --> 00:35:36.590
We were growing information,
we were growing data.


574
00:35:38.510 --> 00:35:40.830
For more than ten years,

575
00:35:40.830 --> 00:35:43.350
Alan Bates and his team
of campaigners


576
00:35:43.350 --> 00:35:46.230
had been carefully
gathering evidence bit by bit


577
00:35:46.230 --> 00:35:48.390
against the Post Office.

578
00:35:48.390 --> 00:35:50.470
Because we had those documents,

579
00:35:50.470 --> 00:35:55.030
there was a possibility then
of starting some sort of litigation


580
00:35:55.030 --> 00:35:58.310
in the civil courts
against the Post Office.


581
00:35:58.310 --> 00:36:03.390
If we could find a legal firm
to take it on board for us.


582
00:36:05.590 --> 00:36:07.350
'The headlines this morning.

583
00:36:07.350 --> 00:36:09.950
'A report has criticised
the Post Office for sacking


584
00:36:09.950 --> 00:36:11.550
'or prosecuting subpostmasters

585
00:36:11.550 --> 00:36:14.790
'without establishing the cause
of cash shortfalls


586
00:36:14.790 --> 00:36:16.190
'at their branches.'

587
00:36:16.190 --> 00:36:19.310
Driving into work, normal day,
into Leeds,


588
00:36:19.310 --> 00:36:23.390
and I heard a BBC radio programme.

589
00:36:23.390 --> 00:36:25.910
'If the cash recorded
by the computer system


590
00:36:25.910 --> 00:36:30.310
'does not match up with the cash
that's actually held at the branch,


591
00:36:30.310 --> 00:36:33.190
'then they are held responsible
for it.'


592
00:36:33.190 --> 00:36:35.870
I thought, "There may be something
we could do about this to help,"


593
00:36:35.870 --> 00:36:39.750
because it didn't sound right,
so I contacted Alan Bates.


594
00:36:39.750 --> 00:36:41.470
I explained the case to him,

595
00:36:41.470 --> 00:36:44.430
I showed him the type of evidence
that we had at the time.


596
00:36:44.430 --> 00:36:47.070
And I explained we had no money
at all,


597
00:36:47.070 --> 00:36:48.830
but we felt there was a case there.

598
00:36:48.830 --> 00:36:51.790
So I needed to weigh up
whether or not


599
00:36:51.790 --> 00:36:55.190
we could raise the necessary
litigation funding.


600
00:36:55.190 --> 00:36:59.990
There are specialist funders
who are willing to take the risk,


601
00:36:59.990 --> 00:37:02.230
but only if there are enough of you.

602
00:37:02.230 --> 00:37:06.110
Because otherwise we knew
that Post Office would outspend us


603
00:37:06.110 --> 00:37:07.350
and we would lose.

604
00:37:07.350 --> 00:37:09.990
The only way that we were gonna
be able to break through this


605
00:37:09.990 --> 00:37:13.590
and uncover it
was a full-scale group action.


606
00:37:13.590 --> 00:37:18.510
Group litigation orders are used
when you've got very poor claimants


607
00:37:18.510 --> 00:37:21.630
and they've got enough similarity
in their cases


608
00:37:21.630 --> 00:37:23.870
that you can literally fund one case

609
00:37:23.870 --> 00:37:26.470
and solve a lot
of people's problems.


610
00:37:26.470 --> 00:37:28.710
It was the only
way, and to do that,

611
00:37:28.710 --> 00:37:31.430
we needed a much larger group
of postmasters.


612
00:37:31.430 --> 00:37:33.430
How many would you need?

613
00:37:33.430 --> 00:37:36.030
At least 500.

614
00:37:40.990 --> 00:37:43.750
The meeting kicked off
a nationwide search


615
00:37:43.750 --> 00:37:45.430
to find subpostmasters

616
00:37:45.430 --> 00:37:48.350
who'd had problems with Horizon.

617
00:37:48.350 --> 00:37:53.750
Eventually, 555 people pursued
a group litigation order


618
00:37:53.750 --> 00:37:55.750
against the Post Office.

619
00:37:55.750 --> 00:37:59.750
The case against Post Office
was very much to expose


620
00:37:59.750 --> 00:38:02.990
the way individuals had
been mistreated in there.


621
00:38:02.990 --> 00:38:07.150
The lack of information
that was available from Post Office.


622
00:38:07.150 --> 00:38:10.430
The flaws in the system
they'd never owned up to.


623
00:38:10.430 --> 00:38:15.110
The denial that had happened,
the bullying that had gone on.


624
00:38:15.110 --> 00:38:20.830
The abuse of individuals, the way
that they'd raided people's houses.


625
00:38:20.830 --> 00:38:25.070
The way they'd been so high-handed,
God almighty, didn't give a damn,


626
00:38:25.070 --> 00:38:27.430
their Post Office
and they can do what they want -


627
00:38:27.430 --> 00:38:29.590
that's what we wanted exposing.

628
00:38:30.870 --> 00:38:33.990
Alan had found the lawyers,
they'd got the funding.


629
00:38:33.990 --> 00:38:35.430
And we were on.

630
00:38:37.630 --> 00:38:40.710
Alan and the Justice
For Subpostmasters Alliance


631
00:38:40.710 --> 00:38:45.630
finally took the Post Office
to court to seek financial redress.


632
00:38:47.390 --> 00:38:50.350
Well, I went four days
after my mum died.


633
00:38:51.670 --> 00:38:55.390
She'd said to me,
"Please don't stop."


634
00:38:55.390 --> 00:38:57.270
And she said, "I'll be with you.

635
00:38:58.910 --> 00:39:01.230
"Wherever you are,
I'll be with you."


636
00:39:01.230 --> 00:39:04.030
And, erm, yeah, four days later,
I went to court.


637
00:39:07.150 --> 00:39:11.470
Among Alan's group
of 555 subpostmasters


638
00:39:11.470 --> 00:39:15.470
were people whose lives had been
devastated by the Post Office.


639
00:39:15.470 --> 00:39:20.270
Many had been bankrupted,
prosecuted or imprisoned.


640
00:39:20.270 --> 00:39:24.070
Gathering enough evidence
at the beginning of the case


641
00:39:24.070 --> 00:39:27.110
was challenging because
Post Office had the evidence,


642
00:39:27.110 --> 00:39:29.550
which meant we were having
to build the case


643
00:39:29.550 --> 00:39:31.710
with one arm tied behind our backs.

644
00:39:32.910 --> 00:39:37.150
But during the case, the Post Office
was forced to disclose evidence


645
00:39:37.150 --> 00:39:40.470
they'd always claimed
was irrelevant.


646
00:39:40.470 --> 00:39:43.590
So, what we've got here
is a known-error log.


647
00:39:43.590 --> 00:39:46.990
So what this records is the fact
that there were internet problems,


648
00:39:46.990 --> 00:39:48.590
network problems,

649
00:39:48.590 --> 00:39:51.550
which were causing the error
in the system,


650
00:39:51.550 --> 00:39:53.790
which in turn were messing up
the figures


651
00:39:53.790 --> 00:39:55.950
and causing a financial discrepancy.

652
00:39:55.950 --> 00:40:01.270
This particular example showed that
the transaction that had gone wrong


653
00:40:01.270 --> 00:40:03.150
needed to be manually corrected.

654
00:40:03.150 --> 00:40:08.590
They had teams and teams of people
doing it all day long, year on year.


655
00:40:08.590 --> 00:40:13.230
Quite often in litigation cases,
in court cases, lawyers will say,


656
00:40:13.230 --> 00:40:15.990
"Well, very rarely are we ever
gonna find a smoking gun."


657
00:40:15.990 --> 00:40:18.030
These were smoking guns.

658
00:40:18.030 --> 00:40:22.030
Not just one smoking gun,
multiple smoking guns,


659
00:40:22.030 --> 00:40:25.150
which prove to us
and prove to the court


660
00:40:25.150 --> 00:40:27.790
that there were multiple problems
in the system,


661
00:40:27.790 --> 00:40:31.270
there had been from day one
when it was installed.


662
00:40:31.270 --> 00:40:34.750
And that was why Post Office
lost the court case.


663
00:40:36.950 --> 00:40:39.230
At the end of the court hearings,

664
00:40:39.230 --> 00:40:43.550
Justice Fraser delivered
a 330-page judgement


665
00:40:43.550 --> 00:40:47.030
outlining his findings
on the Horizon system.


666
00:40:47.030 --> 00:40:50.430
On the day the judgement
was handed down,


667
00:40:50.430 --> 00:40:54.030
our side was totally crammed
with people.


668
00:40:54.030 --> 00:40:57.510
The other side of the court,
there were just two people.


669
00:40:57.510 --> 00:40:59.990
They knew what was gonna happen,

670
00:40:59.990 --> 00:41:04.550
they knew which way this judgement
was going to land, and it did.


671
00:41:04.550 --> 00:41:09.750
Mr Justice Fraser's
Horizon Issues judgement:


672
00:41:09.750 --> 00:41:11.750
"This approach by the Post Office

673
00:41:11.750 --> 00:41:16.510
"has amounted, in reality,
to bear assertions and denials..."


674
00:41:16.510 --> 00:41:18.790
"..that ignore
what has actually occurred."


675
00:41:18.790 --> 00:41:22.070
"It amounts to
the 21st-century equivalent


676
00:41:22.070 --> 00:41:25.150
"of maintaining
that the Earth is flat."


677
00:41:25.150 --> 00:41:28.190
Good old Justice Fraser.

678
00:41:28.190 --> 00:41:31.390
The judge said there seemed
to be a culture of secrecy


679
00:41:31.390 --> 00:41:34.830
and excessive confidentially
within the Post Office.


680
00:41:37.070 --> 00:41:40.030
We couldn't be more happy
with the judgement from the court.


681
00:41:40.030 --> 00:41:43.190
This has been the result
of many years' work


682
00:41:43.190 --> 00:41:47.830
to achieve justice
for over 550 people.


683
00:41:47.830 --> 00:41:51.470
It was overwhelming. It was utterly,
utterly damning of Post Office,


684
00:41:51.470 --> 00:41:54.630
and it just vindicated everything
we'd ever said about them.


685
00:41:54.630 --> 00:41:58.630
The win was one of the best days
of my life.


686
00:41:58.630 --> 00:42:02.390
The civil justice system in the UK
had got to the truth.


687
00:42:04.150 --> 00:42:07.710
But the win came
at huge financial cost.


688
00:42:07.710 --> 00:42:12.990
Although the Post Office agreed
to pay £57.5 million in damages,


689
00:42:12.990 --> 00:42:14.510
after legal costs,

690
00:42:14.510 --> 00:42:18.990
the subpostmasters were left
with around £20,000 each.


691
00:42:21.910 --> 00:42:25.790
But the civil court win
did enable the subpostmasters


692
00:42:25.790 --> 00:42:28.270
to appeal
their criminal convictions.


693
00:42:28.270 --> 00:42:31.510
These subpostmasters have not only
had their convictions quashed,


694
00:42:31.510 --> 00:42:34.870
but they've been exonerated
by the Court of Appeal.


695
00:42:37.830 --> 00:42:40.470
I'm not a criminal any more,
I'm a victim.


696
00:42:42.430 --> 00:42:47.870
To date,

697
00:42:47.870 --> 00:42:50.310
have had their names cleared.

698
00:42:53.550 --> 00:42:58.070
The sun was shining, and I was free.

699
00:43:00.790 --> 00:43:03.990
How do you feel now?
Very happy.


700
00:43:03.990 --> 00:43:07.750
At last, you could go home
and tell people you were innocent.


701
00:43:10.790 --> 00:43:13.430
That emotion will...

702
00:43:13.430 --> 00:43:16.750
It was like lifting
that big rucksack


703
00:43:16.750 --> 00:43:20.590
with rocks on your back for years,
and getting rid of it.


704
00:43:21.870 --> 00:43:25.150
Thank you, all.
Let him through, please.


705
00:43:25.150 --> 00:43:27.630
You know,
you could just throw it away.


706
00:43:27.630 --> 00:43:30.750
It was such a big, big relief,

707
00:43:30.750 --> 00:43:34.990
cos the Post Office did a lot
of damage, really, to him.


708
00:43:38.430 --> 00:43:43.790
It's something that we couldn't
fathom that was gonna happen to him.


709
00:43:43.790 --> 00:43:46.870
I didn't have this many people
at my wedding.


710
00:43:46.870 --> 00:43:52.190
But I'm seeing my dad coming back
now, you know, bit by bit.


711
00:43:52.190 --> 00:43:54.870
So we are really grateful,

712
00:43:54.870 --> 00:43:58.990
you know, that we've had this chance
to see that, cos not many have.


713
00:44:00.510 --> 00:44:02.310
Well done. Well done.

714
00:44:07.590 --> 00:44:09.630
God's got me through everything.

715
00:44:09.630 --> 00:44:13.670
I just thought I wanted to
bring you here to show you as well.


716
00:44:17.270 --> 00:44:19.550
I've built myself up.

717
00:44:19.550 --> 00:44:21.790
I've made myself stronger,

718
00:44:21.790 --> 00:44:27.030
and I want everybody to know
that I wasn't a thief.


719
00:44:27.030 --> 00:44:30.150
I didn't rob the Post Office,
as they say.


720
00:44:30.150 --> 00:44:32.910
That's what matters to me,
my name cleared.


721
00:44:34.910 --> 00:44:38.550
And it needs to be told.
Our stories do need to be out there.


722
00:44:40.350 --> 00:44:42.710
It's not just...

723
00:44:42.710 --> 00:44:46.190
a little group of people,
it's hundreds.


724
00:44:47.630 --> 00:44:50.430
Hundreds of people
have been through this.


725
00:44:58.030 --> 00:44:59.630
Everybody ready?

726
00:44:59.630 --> 00:45:04.830
A statutory inquiry has been set up
to find out what went wrong.


727
00:45:06.070 --> 00:45:08.870
Would you not remember
something that significant?


728
00:45:08.870 --> 00:45:10.470
I'm afraid I don't.

729
00:45:10.470 --> 00:45:13.470
I'm sorry, I don't have
an awful lot of memory on that.


730
00:45:13.470 --> 00:45:16.550
I don't remember that at all.

731
00:45:16.550 --> 00:45:18.590
I know who should be
held to account.


732
00:45:18.590 --> 00:45:25.550
I mean, it's the people
who have had a very cushy lifestyle


733
00:45:25.550 --> 00:45:30.550
on vast quantities of money,

734
00:45:30.550 --> 00:45:37.430
whilst they've made hundreds, if not
thousands of individuals suffer,


735
00:45:37.430 --> 00:45:41.710
whilst knowing the real truth
of what's been going on


736
00:45:41.710 --> 00:45:45.830
and denying the truth
to all these individuals.


737
00:45:45.830 --> 00:45:49.350
Those are the people
who should be held responsible.


738
00:46:58.110 --> 00:47:00.150
