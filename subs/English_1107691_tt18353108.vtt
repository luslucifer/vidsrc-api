00:00:47.278 --> 00:00:47.862
Hey, girls!

2
00:00:47.946 --> 00:00:52.116
- Go, go, go baby!
- Eh, eh, eh!


3
00:02:38.723 --> 00:02:41.768
Leaving already?

4
00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:44.771
It's work.

5
00:02:45.855 --> 00:02:47.565
I didn't want to wake you.

6
00:02:48.524 --> 00:02:49.942
‪Why are you so sweet?

7
00:02:51.652 --> 00:02:52.652
How are you feeling?

8
00:02:54.781 --> 00:02:58.201
I feel better... because of you.

9
00:02:59.327 --> 00:03:01.537
- Aw, it's nothing.
- Thank you for last night.


10
00:03:02.538 --> 00:03:04.874
It's nothing, it's the least I could do.

11
00:03:06.834 --> 00:03:08.044
I have to get going.

12
00:03:08.961 --> 00:03:10.755
Right... um...

13
00:03:11.547 --> 00:03:13.633
- I'll walk you out.
- No. It's fine.


14
00:03:14.258 --> 00:03:17.261
That won't be necessary.
I know my way out.


15
00:03:17.345 --> 00:03:18.429
Besides, you need to rest.

16
00:03:18.513 --> 00:03:22.100
- No, but I... I just...
- No. Rest, Boma. Rest.


17
00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:24.811
I'll see you.

18
00:03:25.812 --> 00:03:26.813
Today?

19
00:03:27.855 --> 00:03:30.733
Um... I have work till very late.

20
00:03:31.275 --> 00:03:32.485
So I can't really say.

21
00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:37.573
But I'll come tomorrow,
you know, spend the whole day with you.


22
00:03:39.158 --> 00:03:40.159
Would you like that?

23
00:03:43.287 --> 00:03:46.958
I should get going
before my boss bites my head off.


24
00:03:48.918 --> 00:03:49.918
Alright.

25
00:03:50.503 --> 00:03:52.713
- Be safe.
- Yeah. See you.


26
00:03:53.423 --> 00:03:54.424
- Bye.
- Bye.


27
00:04:12.442 --> 00:04:15.486
Hi, so you know,
I'm so glad that you came down.


28
00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:18.614
‪lt's just like... so for me,
‪it's all about making money, right?


29
00:04:21.033 --> 00:04:25.538
Thank you. Thank you
very much. I try. I try my best.


30
00:04:25.621 --> 00:04:32.503
- You know, to make things work and er...
- Boma!


31
00:04:32.587 --> 00:04:38.092
- Hey, Boma! Hey, girl!
- Sorry, excuse me.


32
00:04:38.176 --> 00:04:40.511
- Hey, hey, hey!
- Oh my God, Fade!


33
00:04:41.554 --> 00:04:42.930
‪Hey, honey!

34
00:04:43.014 --> 00:04:45.850
What is this? Is this
a "disco" we're having?


35
00:04:45.933 --> 00:04:48.769
Well, I heard "mingle"
so I dressed the part.


36
00:04:48.853 --> 00:04:50.706
Nobody is going
to take you seriously, you this girl.


37
00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:53.191
I don't want to be taken seriously.
I just want the men


38
00:04:53.274 --> 00:04:56.360
to stare.
Let them drop saliva. That's all.


39
00:04:56.444 --> 00:04:59.697
- You are crazy.
- Thank you, honey. So why do I start?


40
00:05:00.281 --> 00:05:02.575
There's drinks over here
and there's food over here.


41
00:05:02.658 --> 00:05:03.201
‪Food first.

42
00:05:03.284 --> 00:05:07.914
- Alright baby. Let's go.
- Alright, thank you. Food first.


43
00:05:10.333 --> 00:05:12.793
- Who do we have here?
- Silly girl.


44
00:05:12.877 --> 00:05:14.378
‪-You can go.
‪-Thank you.


45
00:05:15.129 --> 00:05:20.176
Wow! Guys, guys give
it up, give it up!

46
00:05:20.259 --> 00:05:22.929
Thank you so much baby girl.

47
00:05:23.513 --> 00:05:25.157
- Mwah, you did amazing.
- You are welcome.


48
00:05:25.181 --> 00:05:30.478
Thanks so much. Um, guys
give it up for my awesome friend, Mimz.


49
00:05:34.982 --> 00:05:40.238
Oh my gosh. So I don't know how much you
were going to tell them but...


50
00:05:41.322 --> 00:05:42.531
Hey you.

51
00:05:46.035 --> 00:05:49.830
- You!
- I was just messing with you a little.


52
00:05:49.914 --> 00:05:52.291
- Where's Azeem?
- He went for a quick trip. Um,


53
00:05:52.375 --> 00:05:53.855
‪I came with a friend if that's okay.

54
00:05:53.918 --> 00:05:57.546
It's my eat-and-mingle, girl.
I'm ready to serve everyone. Where is she?


55
00:05:57.630 --> 00:05:59.048
- He.
- A he?


56
00:05:59.131 --> 00:06:01.467
- Yes, a friend from uni.
- A he?


57
00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:04.512
We ran into each other and erm...

58
00:06:04.595 --> 00:06:07.890
There he is.
Xavier, this is my friend, Boma.


59
00:06:07.974 --> 00:06:08.683
Hi.

60
00:06:08.766 --> 00:06:11.644
‪Er... I'm actually her husband's friend.

61
00:06:11.727 --> 00:06:13.980
I snatched her from him.

62
00:06:15.314 --> 00:06:16.691
Xavier. Builder.

63
00:06:17.566 --> 00:06:19.151
Um, Boma, consultant.

64
00:06:19.735 --> 00:06:22.238
Ah, nice to meet you. 
Is this your place?

65
00:06:22.321 --> 00:06:25.533
- Yes.
- Good build. Must have cost a fortune.


66
00:06:26.242 --> 00:06:28.911
- Well...
- Don't let her humility daze you.


67
00:06:28.995 --> 00:06:30.538
‪She has money, alright.

68
00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:32.164
Girl, where is the food?

69
00:06:32.248 --> 00:06:35.334
Erm, ah, there's drinks
over here and food is...


70
00:06:35.418 --> 00:06:37.962
‪Alright, enjoy.
‪I'll be right back. I'm coming.


71
00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:43.759
- Would you like a tour of the house?
- Sure, yeah. I'd like that.


72
00:06:43.843 --> 00:06:45.553
- Okay. Let's do this.
- After you.


73
00:06:49.598 --> 00:06:50.598
‪Boy!

74
00:07:15.207 --> 00:07:16.876
Hey, this one!

75
00:07:18.544 --> 00:07:22.298
‪I have this one locked down,
‪you ain't going nowhere.


76
00:07:24.550 --> 00:07:28.721
Xavier. Such a hunk.

77
00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:33.643
‪Okay, when?
‪Alright, that's fine. Set it up.


78
00:07:33.726 --> 00:07:37.104
I'll be at the office shortly. Bye-bye.

79
00:07:41.901 --> 00:07:45.529
Hmm. Good morning, sunshine.

80
00:07:46.197 --> 00:07:48.407
- Good morning, wife.
- Good morning, husband.


81
00:07:49.325 --> 00:07:52.036
- Gosh, you look so beautiful.
- Aww, thank you.


82
00:07:52.119 --> 00:07:55.122
- Whew! So sexy.
- Thank you.


83
00:07:55.665 --> 00:07:59.293
Come on to daddy. Ooh!

84
00:08:09.720 --> 00:08:13.015
Okay, okay, okay. Stop...

85
00:08:13.557 --> 00:08:16.060
before you eat
"burnt offering" for breakfast.


86
00:08:16.143 --> 00:08:17.478
‪I want you for breakfast.

87
00:08:17.561 --> 00:08:18.688
Okay.

88
00:08:19.397 --> 00:08:20.648
‪I wan't you right here.

89
00:08:20.731 --> 00:08:25.361
- Okay fine.
- Okay fine. I'll let you be.


90
00:08:25.444 --> 00:08:27.405
- Thank you.
- So you can make breakfast.


91
00:08:28.280 --> 00:08:29.299
‪I'll be waiting for you
‪in the room though.


92
00:08:29.323 --> 00:08:31.742
- In the room?
- Erm, the living room.


93
00:08:31.826 --> 00:08:35.454
- Better.
- Cool. Damn, baby girl.


94
00:08:38.958 --> 00:08:40.358
So what are your plans today, baby?

95
00:08:41.127 --> 00:08:42.127
‪What do you mean?

96
00:08:42.586 --> 00:08:44.755
I mean are you expecting any clients over?

97
00:08:44.839 --> 00:08:47.007
‪I told you
‪I'm taking a break from all of that.


98
00:08:47.550 --> 00:08:51.429
Hmm. Uh, that's true. I was just checking,
in case you changed your mind.


99
00:08:51.512 --> 00:08:52.930
‪Why would I change my mind?

100
00:08:53.013 --> 00:08:55.975
- Babe. Says the workaholic.
- Really?


101
00:08:56.058 --> 00:08:58.477
- Yes!
- Like you don't work hard.


102
00:09:03.232 --> 00:09:06.485
- Who's that?
- I don't know, unknown number.


103
00:09:07.570 --> 00:09:10.364
Why would somebody I do not know
call me early in the morning


104
00:09:10.448 --> 00:09:11.448
‪with an unknown number?

105
00:09:11.991 --> 00:09:13.743
This fool will sleep there.

106
00:09:13.826 --> 00:09:15.786
‪Ah no, just... 
Oh, for real...

107
00:09:17.997 --> 00:09:19.457
Why are you laughing?

108
00:09:19.540 --> 00:09:21.667
‪You trying to speak Pidgin is funny.

109
00:09:21.751 --> 00:09:25.755
- But I try.
- Don't try. It just doesn't enter, please.


110
00:09:28.048 --> 00:09:31.135
Why don't we ever
eat at the dining table?

111
00:09:31.218 --> 00:09:36.724
Um... well, maybe when the baby
comes, then we would be more civil.


112
00:09:36.807 --> 00:09:38.017
‪I am civil.

113
00:09:39.810 --> 00:09:45.441
- Baby, what are you trying to say? Baby?
- You, you're the hooligan actually.


114
00:09:45.524 --> 00:09:49.487
- You're...
- I'm not gonna say anything.


115
00:09:51.405 --> 00:09:54.825
Babe, are you okay? 
Come, come, come.

116
00:09:54.909 --> 00:09:57.244
- Here, take. Take some water.
- No, no, I'm...


117
00:09:57.328 --> 00:09:58.328
‪Sorry, are you okay?

118
00:09:59.038 --> 00:10:00.289
- Yeah.
- What's wrong?


119
00:10:01.624 --> 00:10:04.627
The food. It went
down the wrong pipe, that's all.


120
00:10:04.710 --> 00:10:06.921
- Ah. okay.
- Yeah...


121
00:10:07.004 --> 00:10:09.048
- Please don't choke on me now.
- I won't.


122
00:10:14.386 --> 00:10:16.388
- Hey, what's up?
- Don't.


123
00:10:18.057 --> 00:10:20.643
Look whatever this is,
it has got to stop.

124
00:10:21.560 --> 00:10:23.062
I don't mind losing a friend,

125
00:10:23.145 --> 00:10:25.356
‪but I definitely
‪do not want to lose my marriage.


126
00:10:26.023 --> 00:10:27.233
Where's all this coming from?

127
00:10:28.400 --> 00:10:30.611
Get your act together. Okay?

128
00:10:31.153 --> 00:10:34.907
Look, we were done
a long time ago and now we are done.


129
00:10:35.658 --> 00:10:38.244
- Donna...
- Don't text me. Do not call me.


130
00:10:38.327 --> 00:10:39.328
Donna.

131
00:10:40.913 --> 00:10:43.332
Tell her the truth. 
She deserves it.

132
00:10:45.417 --> 00:10:47.127
- Alright, can I just...
- Good night.


133
00:10:47.753 --> 00:10:49.588
And Xavier, goodbye.

134
00:10:55.386 --> 00:10:57.638
‪Check me, check
me. I see you dancing on...


135
00:10:58.973 --> 00:11:01.308
Stop it. Stop.

136
00:11:03.185 --> 00:11:05.437
‪Yeah I like it
when you check on that boy...


137
00:11:12.152 --> 00:11:14.947
Hi Donna, it's me, Xavier.

138
00:11:16.240 --> 00:11:20.244
I know we're not exactly
on good terms right now, I understand.


139
00:11:20.327 --> 00:11:23.455
But this isn't about me,
it's about your friend.


140
00:11:23.539 --> 00:11:24.623
I love you.

141
00:11:25.165 --> 00:11:28.586
You know I love you.
And I love you too, my baby.


142
00:11:28.669 --> 00:11:30.379
Mwah!

143
00:11:33.924 --> 00:11:38.554
Baby, please are you sure... you know, I'm
just... See, I don't have to go to work.


144
00:11:38.637 --> 00:11:40.740
- I can just reschedule.
- Baby, okay, okay, you need to go to work.


145
00:11:40.764 --> 00:11:43.004
- Please, can I just stay home?
- You need to go to work.


146
00:11:44.351 --> 00:11:46.103
- I love you.
- I love you!


147
00:11:46.186 --> 00:11:48.480
- One more. For the road.
- Okay.


148
00:11:52.735 --> 00:11:53.611
Bye.

149
00:11:53.694 --> 00:11:56.155
‪lf I don't go now,
‪trust me, I won't go to work.


150
00:11:56.238 --> 00:11:57.906
- I know.
- Whew!


151
00:12:08.834 --> 00:12:11.003
<i>Hi Donna, it's me, Xavier.</i>

152
00:12:11.962 --> 00:12:14.298
<i>I know we're
not exactly on good terms right now</i>


153
00:12:14.381 --> 00:12:16.300
<i>and I completely understand.</i>

154
00:12:17.134 --> 00:12:19.803
<i>But this isn't about me,
it's about your friend.</i>


155
00:12:21.430 --> 00:12:25.267
<i>I don't know when you last spoke to her
but she needs you now more than ever.</i>


156
00:12:25.893 --> 00:12:28.771
<i>She's been going through a lot.
She may not have enough time.</i>


157
00:12:32.858 --> 00:12:34.401
I don't know what to do, Donna.

158
00:12:37.863 --> 00:12:41.158
- I'm beautiful...
- Yes, you are.


159
00:12:41.659 --> 00:12:43.994
Successful...

160
00:12:45.162 --> 00:12:47.665
I don't look for anybody's trouble...

161
00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:54.046
I love "love." I'm such a romantic.
But why can't I find love?


162
00:12:55.172 --> 00:12:56.173
It is not you.

163
00:12:56.840 --> 00:13:01.345
- It's me. Donna, it's me.
- Shh.


164
00:13:01.970 --> 00:13:05.057
Babe, stop. Don't do this to yourself.

165
00:13:08.143 --> 00:13:10.771
I'm tired of being alone.

166
00:13:12.189 --> 00:13:14.608
‪-Come here. Come here.
‪-Babe.


167
00:13:17.903 --> 00:13:19.071
Try again.

168
00:13:19.154 --> 00:13:22.741
‪I don't have the heart for it,
‪I don't have the heart for it.


169
00:13:22.825 --> 00:13:28.163
Listen to me, if you don't try
again, the man will not find you.


170
00:13:28.247 --> 00:13:30.374
I don't want to try.

171
00:13:31.208 --> 00:13:34.253
Like, this is draining. It's tiring.

172
00:13:34.336 --> 00:13:36.880
The emotional roller coaster is too...

173
00:13:38.132 --> 00:13:41.093
Hey, come here.
Let me tell you something. Okay, fine.


174
00:13:41.927 --> 00:13:46.432
Let's not think
of relationships, men, nothing.


175
00:13:47.808 --> 00:13:50.561
Let's just let loose, have fun

176
00:13:51.437 --> 00:13:54.148
Boma okay, focus on yourself.

177
00:13:54.940 --> 00:13:57.484
Maybe then, a man will come.

178
00:13:58.444 --> 00:13:59.695
Hmm?

179
00:14:00.821 --> 00:14:01.822
Are you sure?

180
00:14:02.865 --> 00:14:04.158
I'm sure.

181
00:14:05.284 --> 00:14:07.286
Are you sure, sure, sure?

182
00:14:07.369 --> 00:14:09.288
Boma, I am sure, sure, sure.

183
00:14:09.788 --> 00:14:12.124
Love will definitely come.

184
00:14:12.750 --> 00:14:16.754
- I should be paying you for your sessions.
- Girl, I charge in dollars.


185
00:14:17.296 --> 00:14:19.423
Here, have your ice cream, okay?

186
00:15:30.619 --> 00:15:32.746
Hey...

187
00:15:36.792 --> 00:15:38.168
Hello?

188
00:15:38.919 --> 00:15:40.045
Ehen. Ehen. Ehen.

189
00:15:40.129 --> 00:15:40.963
‪Please...

190
00:15:41.046 --> 00:15:43.715
Don't patronize me
with that elongated hello.


191
00:15:44.299 --> 00:15:45.339
Where were you last night?

192
00:15:45.926 --> 00:15:47.636
Last night, as in yesterday?

193
00:15:48.137 --> 00:15:51.640
<i>No. Last night as in
the afternoon of tomorrow.</i>


194
00:15:51.723 --> 00:15:53.350
Rubbish, where were you anyway?

195
00:15:53.433 --> 00:15:54.473
I was at home, where else?

196
00:15:56.061 --> 00:15:58.772
Oh my gosh, the party!

197
00:15:58.856 --> 00:16:02.985
<i>Oh my God, the party.
So you forgot we made plans?</i>


198
00:16:03.861 --> 00:16:08.699
Oh sorry, Fade, it's not like that.
Something just came up.


199
00:16:09.616 --> 00:16:11.076
See if you want to lie,

200
00:16:11.160 --> 00:16:12.953
‪you should at
least tell a meaningful lie.


201
00:16:13.036 --> 00:16:14.956
What do you mean,
"something came up last night"?


202
00:16:15.664 --> 00:16:17.374
<i>Fade... calm down.</i>

203
00:16:18.417 --> 00:16:23.005
Okay Boma tell me,
what's the thing that came up last night?


204
00:16:23.672 --> 00:16:25.132
I can't tell you over the phone.

205
00:16:25.841 --> 00:16:27.050
Ahn-ahn.

206
00:16:28.260 --> 00:16:29.803
What?

207
00:16:30.470 --> 00:16:31.889
I'm listening.

208
00:16:31.972 --> 00:16:34.474
You know what?
Just come over and I'll gist you.


209
00:16:34.558 --> 00:16:38.020
I should come over? Ahn-ahn.

210
00:16:38.687 --> 00:16:39.687
<i>Yes.</i>

211
00:16:40.355 --> 00:16:42.441
Is it that serious?

212
00:16:42.524 --> 00:16:43.817
‪Just come!

213
00:16:44.318 --> 00:16:45.319
<i>Okay, okay, okay.</i>

214
00:16:45.402 --> 00:16:46.403
‪Let me just rush home,

215
00:16:46.987 --> 00:16:48.307
get dressed and I'll be with you.

216
00:16:48.572 --> 00:16:50.574
Get home and get dressed?
But I thought you were...


217
00:16:51.241 --> 00:16:53.452
Hey! Fadela, Fadula!

218
00:16:54.119 --> 00:16:55.913
Fadela, Fadula!

219
00:16:55.996 --> 00:16:58.248
‪Miss, shut your mouth.

220
00:16:58.332 --> 00:17:00.125
Shut your mouth. 
My Uber is here.

221
00:17:00.209 --> 00:17:01.418
‪I should close my mouth?

222
00:17:01.501 --> 00:17:04.880
When all your mouth, all your opening,
everything was open yesterday,


223
00:17:04.963 --> 00:17:06.858
you're telling me that
I should close my own mouth.


224
00:17:06.882 --> 00:17:08.091
Fadela, Fadula!

225
00:17:09.009 --> 00:17:10.844
Just come let me tell you.

226
00:17:12.679 --> 00:17:13.722
Yeah.

227
00:17:17.142 --> 00:17:20.312
Ah gosh. So good.

228
00:17:21.355 --> 00:17:24.650
I'm going to stay here,
I won't bathe till tomorrow.


229
00:17:25.817 --> 00:17:27.152
I don't understand.

230
00:17:28.195 --> 00:17:30.989
You said she's
not feeling well, what do you mean?


231
00:17:31.490 --> 00:17:35.035
- I'm not entirely sure.
<i>- You are not entirely sure?</i>


232
00:17:35.118 --> 00:17:37.996
You sent me a voice note
saying she doesn't have much time left.


233
00:17:38.080 --> 00:17:38.956
What does that mean?

234
00:17:39.039 --> 00:17:41.458
She's not exactly
being straight forward with me.


235
00:17:41.541 --> 00:17:44.261
You know how she likes to act
like she's stronger than everyone else.


236
00:17:44.586 --> 00:17:46.421
<i>I've been visiting her
for a few days and...</i>


237
00:17:47.339 --> 00:17:49.859
<i>I thought since you guys
are friends you know, I'd let you know.</i>


238
00:17:50.342 --> 00:17:51.343
Were.

239
00:17:52.052 --> 00:17:55.013
Were friends. She's not exactly
my biggest fan right now.


240
00:17:56.682 --> 00:17:58.767
- And you?
<i>- Me?</i>


241
00:17:58.850 --> 00:18:01.979
Yes. The last time I checked
you guys were not in the best place


242
00:18:02.646 --> 00:18:03.939
How did you find out?

243
00:18:04.022 --> 00:18:07.401
No. I mean, I just ran into her a few
weekends ago and you know...


244
00:18:08.068 --> 00:18:10.153
you know, we sort of... yeah.

245
00:18:10.654 --> 00:18:12.990
Anyway erm,
does she still live in that her estate?


246
00:18:13.073 --> 00:18:15.701
Yeah. Erm, Ajayi Estate, why?

247
00:18:16.410 --> 00:18:17.953
Are you planning on heading there now?

248
00:18:18.036 --> 00:18:19.514
Planning? I'm heading there right away.

249
00:18:19.538 --> 00:18:20.956
<i>Now? Like, as in now?</i>

250
00:18:21.039 --> 00:18:22.874
Yes, you said you left her at home.

251
00:18:22.958 --> 00:18:24.167
Alright, alright. No,

252
00:18:24.251 --> 00:18:26.938
I just thought that you'd have clients
you were attending to, you know that.


253
00:18:26.962 --> 00:18:28.672
I'm not, okay?

254
00:18:28.755 --> 00:18:30.632
Erm, I'll be on my way. Bye.

255
00:18:31.717 --> 00:18:34.678
Hello? It's fine.

256
00:18:36.888 --> 00:18:41.143
So in a nutshell, it's an app that
helps users, in this case single people...


257
00:18:41.226 --> 00:18:43.270
- Yeah.
- find happily-ever-after...


258
00:18:43.353 --> 00:18:44.980
‪-Exactly.
‪-... that leads to matrimony.


259
00:18:45.522 --> 00:18:48.483
Exactly. Users just
need to download the app


260
00:18:48.567 --> 00:18:51.153
and, they're well
on their way to finding love.


261
00:19:03.248 --> 00:19:08.962
Hey babe, erm... Yeah sorry,
I was in, um... are you on the road?


262
00:19:09.046 --> 00:19:10.797
Azeem. Azeem, it's Boma.

263
00:19:11.381 --> 00:19:13.467
- She, she's not feeling well.
- Woah.


264
00:19:14.009 --> 00:19:17.387
Okay, you need to relax okay? Please.

265
00:19:17.929 --> 00:19:21.975
Re-lax. Take it easy. 
Are you driving?

266
00:19:22.059 --> 00:19:22.768
Yes.

267
00:19:22.851 --> 00:19:26.313
<i>- Ah. So where are you going?</i>
- Where else? To her house of course.


268
00:19:26.396 --> 00:19:28.857
<i>Wait, which Boma are you talking about?</i>

269
00:19:28.940 --> 00:19:31.109
Ah, which other Boma do we know, babe?

270
00:19:31.193 --> 00:19:33.403
Babe calm down, just
calm down, calm down...


271
00:19:33.487 --> 00:19:37.449
I mean, I thought you and Boma
were not on talking terms so I um...


272
00:19:38.450 --> 00:19:40.577
<i>Yes, we don't speak but</i>

273
00:19:40.660 --> 00:19:43.014
<i>Xavier called me and told me
that she might not have enough time.</i>


274
00:19:43.038 --> 00:19:44.581
Did I just hear you say Xavier?

275
00:19:45.457 --> 00:19:46.041
Why is he calling you?

276
00:19:46.124 --> 00:19:48.668
<i>Azeem, that is not the issue right now.</i>

277
00:19:48.752 --> 00:19:50.712
<i>The issue is our friend might be dying.</i>

278
00:19:50.796 --> 00:19:52.130
<i>I thought to tell you.</i>

279
00:19:52.214 --> 00:19:56.301
But babe... hello, babe.

280
00:20:02.307 --> 00:20:04.351
Um, so sorry.

281
00:20:06.103 --> 00:20:07.103
Boy.

282
00:20:07.562 --> 00:20:10.357
That was my wife.
It's an emergency. She's pregnant so...


283
00:20:10.440 --> 00:20:13.402
- Congratulations.
- Yeah. Um, go ahead.


284
00:20:14.111 --> 00:20:16.780
- Yes, so...
- So your app is it subscription based?


285
00:20:16.863 --> 00:20:20.325
Yes, we actually
have a healthy subscription base, erm...


286
00:20:20.409 --> 00:20:24.162
But right now we are focused on
protecting the back-end of our platform


287
00:20:24.246 --> 00:20:25.831
and that's where you come in.

288
00:20:25.914 --> 00:20:29.584
We are counting on your solutions
to tie up our back-end.


289
00:20:31.795 --> 00:20:35.424
I'm sorry. Er, so sorry.
I apologise, I'm a bit distracted.


290
00:20:35.966 --> 00:20:38.510
Like I said it was
an emergency call from my wife and erm...


291
00:20:39.094 --> 00:20:42.472
Do you mind if we cut short
this meeting? Next time. okay? Please,


292
00:20:42.556 --> 00:20:45.809
- my assistant will help me see you out.
- Alright.


293
00:20:45.892 --> 00:20:47.252
- Thank you.
- Yeah. So um... yeah.


294
00:20:48.854 --> 00:20:51.231
I'm coming! This babe...

295
00:20:51.314 --> 00:20:53.316
Do you want to spoil my door?

296
00:20:53.400 --> 00:20:55.485
This... do you want to spoil my door?

297
00:21:03.452 --> 00:21:04.453
What are you doing here?

298
00:21:04.536 --> 00:21:06.538
Come here.

299
00:21:14.754 --> 00:21:15.755
Why?

300
00:21:16.590 --> 00:21:17.799
Why didn't you tell me?

301
00:21:19.509 --> 00:21:22.095
Look, I know that you and I,
we had our differences.


302
00:21:22.679 --> 00:21:23.889
But come on.

303
00:21:24.723 --> 00:21:26.808
You tell me everything.

304
00:21:26.892 --> 00:21:28.351
Why didn't you tell me?

305
00:21:30.353 --> 00:21:31.730
Were you embarrassed?

306
00:21:33.064 --> 00:21:35.609
What are you talking about?

307
00:21:37.611 --> 00:21:39.946
Erm... Xavier...

308
00:21:40.697 --> 00:21:43.617
He told me about... about the illness.

309
00:21:44.367 --> 00:21:47.078
I told him not to tell anyone.

310
00:21:51.249 --> 00:21:52.792
And that includes me?

311
00:22:09.976 --> 00:22:12.979
- Boma, I know the last time you and I...
- Yeah.


312
00:22:13.480 --> 00:22:14.480
A year ago.

313
00:22:15.941 --> 00:22:17.692
Yes, a year ago.

314
00:22:20.195 --> 00:22:23.615
We didn't exactly
end things on a great note.


315
00:22:24.783 --> 00:22:28.286
And I take full responsibility for that.

316
00:22:31.957 --> 00:22:34.542
Look, I've thought
hard and long about my...


317
00:22:34.626 --> 00:22:35.626
‪Donna...

318
00:22:35.961 --> 00:22:36.962
Please.

319
00:22:37.754 --> 00:22:38.755
I'd really appreciate it

320
00:22:39.547 --> 00:22:41.883
if you don't speak
to me like I'm one of your clients.


321
00:22:42.425 --> 00:22:43.425
Right.

322
00:22:44.844 --> 00:22:47.347
You are right,
um, you are not one of my clients.


323
00:22:48.640 --> 00:22:51.309
But Boma, this is
me and you we're talking about here.


324
00:22:52.811 --> 00:22:54.980
We tell each other everything.

325
00:22:56.147 --> 00:23:00.860
Boma, if you are going through something
as painful as this, you should come to me.


326
00:23:01.486 --> 00:23:05.073
I don't have to hear it
from Xavier of all people.


327
00:23:06.491 --> 00:23:07.867
So he called you.

328
00:23:08.410 --> 00:23:09.411
Yes he did.

329
00:23:10.996 --> 00:23:12.664
He was worried about you.

330
00:23:14.958 --> 00:23:17.377
And he said he spent the night here.

331
00:23:17.460 --> 00:23:19.546
It's not what you think,
he was just being nice.


332
00:23:19.629 --> 00:23:23.174
‪Right, let's not
‪call it what it really is.


333
00:23:24.009 --> 00:23:26.511
- Babe, that's guilty conscience.
- Donna, come on.


334
00:23:28.013 --> 00:23:29.180
Fine.

335
00:23:32.309 --> 00:23:33.310
Boma...

336
00:23:34.019 --> 00:23:36.146
- What did they say the problem is?
- Huh?


337
00:23:36.813 --> 00:23:41.192
- The doctors. What was the diagnosis?
- Oh. Um... yeah... err...


338
00:23:42.068 --> 00:23:45.447
I think, I think he said...
I think he said it was leukemia.


339
00:23:47.324 --> 00:23:49.200
You think?

340
00:23:50.869 --> 00:23:53.538
- I should go get that.
- No, no, no. Please sit. Sit.


341
00:23:54.039 --> 00:23:55.582
I'll get the door, okay?

342
00:23:55.665 --> 00:23:57.025
You don't have to stress yourself.

343
00:24:04.466 --> 00:24:06.051
- Hey, baby.
- Babe.


344
00:24:06.134 --> 00:24:09.054
- How are you, my love? Mwah!
- Fuck. Azeem.


345
00:24:09.137 --> 00:24:10.221
What are you doing here?

346
00:24:10.305 --> 00:24:12.390
What do you mean? 
You called me.

347
00:24:12.474 --> 00:24:14.017
Yes I did. What about your meeting?

348
00:24:14.100 --> 00:24:16.061
Oh, I rescheduled. Where is she?

349
00:24:17.395 --> 00:24:19.898
- Boma.
- Azeem.


350
00:24:20.648 --> 00:24:21.876
I'm sorry, I called
him on my way here.

351
00:24:21.900 --> 00:24:23.818
And rightfully so.

352
00:24:24.486 --> 00:24:27.405
- What happened to you
- Doctor says it's leukemia.


353
00:24:28.031 --> 00:24:30.283
Great God! Leukemia.?

354
00:24:31.618 --> 00:24:32.869
Boma, you have leukemia?

355
00:24:34.037 --> 00:24:35.163
For how long?

356
00:24:35.872 --> 00:24:37.916
Erm, about two to three months.

357
00:24:38.458 --> 00:24:39.458
For that long?

358
00:24:40.752 --> 00:24:42.629
Huh? And you didn't tell anybody?

359
00:24:43.838 --> 00:24:46.216
I know you are not
talking to my wife, but at least,


360
00:24:46.299 --> 00:24:47.592
you, you could have come to me.

361
00:24:48.176 --> 00:24:49.302
We were friends first!

362
00:24:50.053 --> 00:24:53.431
Come on, Boma,
we're talking about your health here.


363
00:24:53.515 --> 00:24:56.059
- I... I know. I just... I just didn't...
- Azeem stop okay.


364
00:24:56.142 --> 00:24:58.311
This is not the time to interrogate her.

365
00:24:58.395 --> 00:24:59.938
She's going through a lot.

366
00:25:00.939 --> 00:25:03.525
I'm sorry.
I'm... I'm sorry, I didn't mean to...


367
00:25:03.608 --> 00:25:05.944
to, to get at you like that.

368
00:25:08.446 --> 00:25:10.156
Boy. Are you treating it?

369
00:25:12.075 --> 00:25:13.326
How long?

370
00:25:13.910 --> 00:25:15.954
Erm, about a month now.

371
00:25:18.623 --> 00:25:22.961
- A month. Chemo?
- Who's catering to you?


372
00:25:26.714 --> 00:25:27.757
Are you sure?

373
00:25:28.716 --> 00:25:29.717
Why?

374
00:25:31.052 --> 00:25:34.639
I'm sorry but I mean you don't
look like someone going through chemo.


375
00:25:34.722 --> 00:25:36.850
You're not experiencing hair loss.

376
00:25:37.559 --> 00:25:40.979
- Your skin looks perfect.
- No, no, I'm wearing a wig.


377
00:25:41.062 --> 00:25:42.981
I have make up on and erm,

378
00:25:43.064 --> 00:25:47.026
you know it's more
memory loss and loss of appetite for me.


379
00:25:49.154 --> 00:25:55.452
Look Azeem, her body is clearly responding
to treatment well. That's a good sign.


380
00:25:55.994 --> 00:25:57.912
- Glory to God.
- Stop fussing, eh?


381
00:25:58.788 --> 00:25:59.581
Are you okay?

382
00:25:59.664 --> 00:26:01.207
- Are you okay?
- Are you alright?


383
00:26:01.291 --> 00:26:01.791
Water.

384
00:26:01.875 --> 00:26:03.018
Please baby, get water for her, please.

385
00:26:03.042 --> 00:26:04.103
- Okay, I'll get water for her.
- Sorry.


386
00:26:04.127 --> 00:26:09.382
Sorry.

387
00:26:10.800 --> 00:26:11.843
Are you expecting someone?

388
00:26:23.062 --> 00:26:25.940
Azeem, I didn't realize you were here too.

389
00:26:26.691 --> 00:26:28.067
You called my wife, didn't you?

390
00:26:28.651 --> 00:26:30.862
Yes, I did. But I thought...

391
00:26:32.739 --> 00:26:36.868
Someone was hoping to get
some alone time with my woman.


392
00:26:37.619 --> 00:26:38.828
Hmm.

393
00:26:40.371 --> 00:26:43.041
Sorry to burst your bubble.

394
00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:45.835
Shut the door behind you.

395
00:26:54.636 --> 00:26:57.055
- Hi.
- Hi. How are you?


396
00:26:57.722 --> 00:26:58.932
How are you feeling?

397
00:26:59.432 --> 00:27:01.059
Babe, I'm so sorry,

398
00:27:02.143 --> 00:27:03.228
Hey.

399
00:27:11.402 --> 00:27:12.402
Hey.

400
00:27:15.490 --> 00:27:17.492
‪-Hi baby, sit here. Alright.
‪-Okay.


401
00:27:18.159 --> 00:27:23.873
Erm, so what are you doing here?
You said...


402
00:27:23.957 --> 00:27:26.042
you were going to
be busy today, all day.

403
00:27:26.626 --> 00:27:28.836
Yeah I was. I
mean I am, you know.

404
00:27:28.920 --> 00:27:30.713
But then I passed by that

405
00:27:31.381 --> 00:27:32.549
chicken place by the bridge.

406
00:27:33.091 --> 00:27:34.691
You know, and I thought you'd want some.

407
00:27:35.260 --> 00:27:37.679
They make the best
chicken pepper soup in Lagos.


408
00:27:37.762 --> 00:27:41.182
You're so sweet and I'm actually starving.

409
00:27:41.266 --> 00:27:44.185
I got some for you as well,
just in case you were hungry.


410
00:27:44.769 --> 00:27:47.355
- You did?
- Yeah, you know.


411
00:27:47.438 --> 00:27:50.817
I told them, err, zero pepper,
just the way you like it.


412
00:27:50.900 --> 00:27:51.818
‪Um...

413
00:27:51.901 --> 00:27:54.237
Well, that's old information.
She eats pepper now.


414
00:27:55.321 --> 00:27:58.992
Yeah, when we had a conversation
you know, she said erm, she was...


415
00:27:59.075 --> 00:28:01.494
When was that? A year ago?

416
00:28:01.578 --> 00:28:03.788
Well, that's long enough to know that...

417
00:28:03.871 --> 00:28:06.165
‪I'm referring to
‪the ulcer incident back in the day.


418
00:28:06.249 --> 00:28:10.336
- Remember? In school? When I had to...
- That's old information, sir!


419
00:28:10.420 --> 00:28:13.965
What? Are you daft or you just fail to
understand that my wife now eats pepper?


420
00:28:14.048 --> 00:28:16.134
- I was just saying...
- Hey, Xavier.


421
00:28:16.801 --> 00:28:17.927
Rest.

422
00:28:19.554 --> 00:28:23.725
The lady's husband
says she eats pepper now, so she does.


423
00:28:23.808 --> 00:28:25.560
Yeah but I'm just trying to say that

424
00:28:25.643 --> 00:28:26.519
- ulcer doesn't magically disapp...
- Are you fuck... honestly,


425
00:28:26.603 --> 00:28:27.770
‪are you fucking kidding me?!

426
00:28:27.854 --> 00:28:29.147
Can both of you just stop?!

427
00:28:29.647 --> 00:28:30.647
Please.

428
00:28:32.483 --> 00:28:34.819
We are here for our friend.

429
00:28:35.612 --> 00:28:38.406
Not to fight and argue
about whether or not I eat pepper!


430
00:28:39.908 --> 00:28:40.908
Please.

431
00:28:42.785 --> 00:28:45.038
And for the record,
Xavier, I eat pepper now.


432
00:28:48.166 --> 00:28:49.166
Azeem...

433
00:28:53.338 --> 00:28:57.300
Boma! Abobo! Fade in the building!

434
00:28:59.260 --> 00:29:01.054
- Is that...?
- Yes, Fade.


435
00:29:01.679 --> 00:29:02.680
You guys still talk?

436
00:29:03.181 --> 00:29:04.265
Yeah, once in a while.

437
00:29:04.849 --> 00:29:06.059
Yes.

438
00:29:06.726 --> 00:29:11.689
Boma, come on, open door and download
all the gist for me. I can't wait.


439
00:29:14.025 --> 00:29:17.695
Be quick or else I'll sit down here
and drink all these drinks by myself.


440
00:29:17.779 --> 00:29:20.031
You know I'm not just talk without action.

441
00:29:20.114 --> 00:29:21.114
Drinks?

442
00:29:21.532 --> 00:29:23.743
Does she know you
can't take alcohol with your meds?


443
00:29:25.620 --> 00:29:26.788
It's fine, I'll get it.

444
00:29:26.871 --> 00:29:29.040
- No, don't worry I'll...
- I said I'll get it!


445
00:29:31.334 --> 00:29:33.211
Madam, I'm not joking.

446
00:29:35.380 --> 00:29:38.299
One... two...

447
00:29:38.383 --> 00:29:39.383
three...

448
00:29:40.468 --> 00:29:43.012
- Azeem?
- Hi


449
00:29:43.554 --> 00:29:45.474
I didn't know you...
I didn't know you were here.


450
00:29:46.057 --> 00:29:47.057
Well, I'm here.

451
00:29:47.392 --> 00:29:49.018
And so is my wife.

452
00:29:49.644 --> 00:29:50.644
Oh.

453
00:29:51.562 --> 00:29:54.649
Hi, everyone! Hey, Boma baby.

454
00:29:54.732 --> 00:29:56.401
How're you doing?

455
00:29:57.568 --> 00:29:58.987
Aunty Life Coach.

456
00:30:00.822 --> 00:30:02.490
What's this thing doing here?

457
00:30:02.573 --> 00:30:04.826
- Hello, Fa...
- Please, please, please.


458
00:30:04.909 --> 00:30:08.913
I don't ever want to hear my name
come out from that your filthy mouth.


459
00:30:09.497 --> 00:30:10.123
Ahn-ahn.

460
00:30:10.206 --> 00:30:11.499
Boma, what's going on?

461
00:30:11.582 --> 00:30:15.211
How can you allow this half-baked
human being into this house?


462
00:30:15.294 --> 00:30:17.088
Despite everything
that he put you through!


463
00:30:17.839 --> 00:30:19.340
- Fade, come on...
- What?!


464
00:30:19.424 --> 00:30:22.969
Ahn-ahn, is it not
the same fool, the same fool


465
00:30:23.052 --> 00:30:25.138
that was using
your heart to be playing softball,


466
00:30:25.221 --> 00:30:27.515
because he was clearly
still in love with someone else?


467
00:30:27.598 --> 00:30:29.058
‪Fade, come on...

468
00:30:33.813 --> 00:30:36.524
Wait. Why is everybody looking like this?

469
00:30:37.650 --> 00:30:38.943
Eh, did somebody die?

470
00:30:40.028 --> 00:30:41.788
- Did someone die?
- She really doesn't know?


471
00:30:42.780 --> 00:30:43.780
Know what?

472
00:30:48.036 --> 00:30:49.076
Boma, you didn't tell her?

473
00:30:49.620 --> 00:30:50.913
Tell her what?

474
00:30:51.789 --> 00:30:57.462
- Erm, I... I... I wanted to tell you...
- Ahn-ahn,


475
00:30:57.545 --> 00:31:00.173
‪Miss, open you mouth!

476
00:31:00.256 --> 00:31:02.759
You called me this morning.
You said there is gist.


477
00:31:02.842 --> 00:31:04.010
I've come to hear gist.

478
00:31:04.093 --> 00:31:05.779
Now you are behaving like
your tongue was caught in a mousetrap.


479
00:31:05.803 --> 00:31:07.805
- What happened?
- For God sakes, are you blind?


480
00:31:09.098 --> 00:31:13.478
What?! She clearly is blind if
she cannot see that her friend is in pain.


481
00:31:13.561 --> 00:31:16.272
Erm, sorry. Excuse me, which friend?

482
00:31:16.355 --> 00:31:18.816
- You have only one friend here.
- Donna.


483
00:31:19.317 --> 00:31:20.318
Boma?

484
00:31:22.153 --> 00:31:24.947
She has cancer. Leukemia.

485
00:31:25.615 --> 00:31:32.246
And the doctors say it's terminal,
meaning she might die.


486
00:31:32.330 --> 00:31:34.290
No, that will not happen. Look...

487
00:31:34.373 --> 00:31:36.125
We're going to fight this, okay?

488
00:31:36.209 --> 00:31:37.585
We cannot lose you.

489
00:31:45.843 --> 00:31:47.362
You need to see
the look on your faces.

490
00:31:47.386 --> 00:31:49.388
‪-What's funny?
‪-Your own is the funniest.


491
00:31:49.931 --> 00:31:52.767
One minute. You guys are funny.

492
00:31:53.643 --> 00:31:58.147
You're asking me what's funny.
It's you people. Boma, what's going on?


493
00:31:58.689 --> 00:32:02.610
- Because...
- Wait. Okay, you need to stop, okay?


494
00:32:02.693 --> 00:32:04.445
This is serious. 
Stop laughing.

495
00:32:05.071 --> 00:32:07.406
I should stop laughing?
You are the one making me laugh.


496
00:32:07.490 --> 00:32:09.802
Boma, please can you tell them they
don't know what they are talking about,


497
00:32:09.826 --> 00:32:10.826
because I'm confused.

498
00:32:13.287 --> 00:32:14.622
I wanted to tell you.

499
00:32:15.331 --> 00:32:16.916
Hey!

500
00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:21.420
But you know, I just...
I just couldn't really find the time.


501
00:32:21.504 --> 00:32:23.548
That was why
I said you should come, so that...


502
00:32:24.257 --> 00:32:25.716
that I had gist for you.

503
00:32:27.343 --> 00:32:29.345
When? Cancer? How?

504
00:32:29.428 --> 00:32:31.556
Look, she was diagnosed few months ago.

505
00:32:32.181 --> 00:32:33.891
Few months ago.

506
00:32:34.559 --> 00:32:37.770
Ahn-ahn. Wait, there's something
I don't understand in this place.


507
00:32:37.854 --> 00:32:43.401
Because this Boma and myself, last
week Friday we were still in the club.


508
00:32:44.402 --> 00:32:46.821
Or are you discussing another
Boma that I don't know about?


509
00:32:48.114 --> 00:32:49.114
Club?

510
00:32:49.782 --> 00:32:50.782
Boma?

511
00:33:12.180 --> 00:33:14.557
You guys don't understand.

512
00:33:17.602 --> 00:33:22.356
Everything is just weighing on me.
I just needed to get away from medication.


513
00:33:23.149 --> 00:33:24.817
- From...
- Wait a minute, wait a minute.


514
00:33:27.278 --> 00:33:30.364
Last week Friday you told me you went
to church. I called you, remember?


515
00:33:30.448 --> 00:33:35.119
Ahn-ahn. Not only church,
how about mosque too.


516
00:33:35.203 --> 00:33:37.788
I said this Boma and
I were in the club.

517
00:33:37.872 --> 00:33:40.666
Had it been
you were there, inside the club,


518
00:33:40.750 --> 00:33:43.127
we were just flooding
our throats with vodka, champagne...


519
00:33:43.211 --> 00:33:44.851
You should have seen how she was dancing.

520
00:33:44.879 --> 00:33:46.047
‪Huh?

521
00:33:46.130 --> 00:33:46.923
Boma, are you okay?

522
00:33:47.006 --> 00:33:48.424
- Boma?
- Are you alright?


523
00:33:48.507 --> 00:33:49.860
- Boma?
- You see what you've caused?


524
00:33:49.884 --> 00:33:51.594
Oh, please, don't talk to me.

525
00:33:51.677 --> 00:33:54.722
Little Miss I-Got-Married-Early-So-
I'm-Better-Than-Everybody. Please!


526
00:33:54.805 --> 00:33:57.201
- Is she talking to... are you talking to me?
- Baby, calm down.


527
00:33:57.225 --> 00:33:59.225
Tell her to calm down.
She's the noise maker there.


528
00:33:59.268 --> 00:34:00.937
Who's a noise maker?

529
00:34:01.020 --> 00:34:02.456
- Can you see what you have caused?
- Boma!


530
00:34:02.480 --> 00:34:04.440
- Rubbish. Hey, don't try it.
- Baby, baby.


531
00:34:04.523 --> 00:34:05.876
- I'll take care of my friend, please.
- Is she...


532
00:34:05.900 --> 00:34:09.946
Baby, baby, baby! Please just sit down.
Please, I beg you.


533
00:34:10.029 --> 00:34:11.989
No need for all this. Please.

534
00:34:13.366 --> 00:34:15.117
My goodness.

535
00:34:30.091 --> 00:34:31.091
Yo, babes.

536
00:34:31.592 --> 00:34:32.592
Babes, it's Fade.

537
00:34:33.511 --> 00:34:36.472
Hello? Boma, are you okay?

538
00:34:37.807 --> 00:34:40.101
Boma, come on.

539
00:34:40.643 --> 00:34:43.479
Boma? Jesus!

540
00:34:43.562 --> 00:34:44.814
Do you want to remove my arm?

541
00:34:44.897 --> 00:34:47.316
I will remove
your arm and every other body part


542
00:34:47.400 --> 00:34:50.528
if you ruin this my plan.
What's wrong with you?


543
00:34:54.198 --> 00:34:55.198
Boma.

544
00:34:55.533 --> 00:34:56.575
Where is the vomit?

545
00:34:59.662 --> 00:35:03.833
Ah. Eh? Boma?

546
00:35:06.335 --> 00:35:07.712
Wow. Wow.

547
00:35:08.379 --> 00:35:11.716
Ah. Boma.

548
00:35:15.720 --> 00:35:16.720
Sorry.

549
00:35:21.434 --> 00:35:22.434
So you...

550
00:35:54.592 --> 00:35:55.843
Stop it.

551
00:36:05.436 --> 00:36:08.522
Er, I want to go get something,
to drink. Would you want any...


552
00:36:08.606 --> 00:36:10.286
- No, we are fine. Thank you.
- Actually...


553
00:36:11.275 --> 00:36:12.276
I don't mind.

554
00:36:17.531 --> 00:36:18.741
Really?

555
00:36:20.451 --> 00:36:23.746
Let me see if I understand
everything going on here.


556
00:36:24.413 --> 00:36:26.290
So, none of this is true?

557
00:36:29.043 --> 00:36:31.003
- No leukemia?
- God forbid.


558
00:36:31.796 --> 00:36:33.214
Church on Friday?

559
00:36:34.006 --> 00:36:35.174
Is God not in the house?

560
00:36:35.257 --> 00:36:37.635
So in short you are not sick?

561
00:36:39.470 --> 00:36:41.764
- No, I am not.
- Ah, then you are sick.


562
00:36:42.723 --> 00:36:45.763
- Yes. For chasing that guy, you are sick.
- Why are you being like this now?


563
00:36:46.394 --> 00:36:49.105
No Boma,
you're the one that is being like this.


564
00:36:49.939 --> 00:36:51.774
You're the one that is being like this.

565
00:36:52.316 --> 00:36:54.235
This was the same guy...

566
00:36:54.318 --> 00:36:58.155
that treated you like a second class
citizen when you guys were dating.


567
00:36:58.239 --> 00:37:01.951
The same guy that forgot
to call you for two weeks.


568
00:37:02.034 --> 00:37:03.536
He said he's looking for a charger.

569
00:37:03.619 --> 00:37:04.703
The same guy that

570
00:37:04.787 --> 00:37:07.415
‪-did not call you on your birthday...
‪-It's okay.


571
00:37:07.498 --> 00:37:08.666
Ah, it's okay.

572
00:37:09.542 --> 00:37:12.128
I know all these things
that he did in the past. Calm down.


573
00:37:12.211 --> 00:37:13.855
So you are telling me now
that he has changed?


574
00:37:13.879 --> 00:37:16.382
‪Yes. Babe, he has changed.

575
00:37:17.758 --> 00:37:19.343
I'm telling you he has changed.

576
00:37:20.177 --> 00:37:23.180
So you genuinely believe all this crap
you're telling yourself, huh?


577
00:37:23.264 --> 00:37:24.264
‪lt's not crap.

578
00:37:25.224 --> 00:37:27.518
Look, you've not been with us
these past few weeks, like,


579
00:37:27.601 --> 00:37:30.229
he is different.
It's like the old times, but better.


580
00:37:31.188 --> 00:37:34.400
Like he's really changed, 
I'm telling you.

581
00:37:34.483 --> 00:37:36.152
Did you just say, 'weeks'?

582
00:37:38.028 --> 00:37:40.448
So you've been putting up
this charade for weeks


583
00:37:40.531 --> 00:37:42.450
‪and you didn't say a thing?

584
00:37:42.533 --> 00:37:44.719
How will I talk, when you're behaving
like an abnormal person.


585
00:37:44.743 --> 00:37:46.328
No, you're the one that is not normal.

586
00:37:46.412 --> 00:37:47.955
Boma, you're not normal.

587
00:37:48.038 --> 00:37:49.358
Are there no other men out there?

588
00:37:50.082 --> 00:37:51.876
Show me the men that are out there!

589
00:37:52.835 --> 00:37:54.604
- Show me, because I'm not seeing anyone.
- Hmm.


590
00:37:54.628 --> 00:37:55.856
- But you see this hunk?
- Mm-hmm.


591
00:37:55.880 --> 00:37:59.467
‪-This guy? My Xavier? My professor X.
‪-Mm-hmm.


592
00:38:00.009 --> 00:38:01.051
He is mine and I am his.

593
00:38:01.927 --> 00:38:05.097
Like he's the one for...
Like he's the one for me.


594
00:38:05.890 --> 00:38:07.224
I like him a lot.

595
00:38:08.392 --> 00:38:10.060
- No.
- I'm gonna die on the... yes.


596
00:38:10.144 --> 00:38:11.604
- I said no!
- I said yes!


597
00:38:11.687 --> 00:38:14.648
Ahn-ahn. I know
what I'm talking about Boma. I said no.


598
00:38:15.274 --> 00:38:17.359
The very moment I walked into that room,

599
00:38:17.443 --> 00:38:21.489
I discovered that,
that your almighty punk, that thing,


600
00:38:21.572 --> 00:38:25.034
is not over that thing. 
Can you not see?

601
00:38:25.659 --> 00:38:27.888
Who? Who are you talking about?
Who are the two of them, what's that?


602
00:38:27.912 --> 00:38:28.912
Who?

603
00:38:29.079 --> 00:38:31.679
Please, who was the reason
you people broke up in the first place?


604
00:38:34.585 --> 00:38:35.585
Look...

605
00:38:36.170 --> 00:38:37.171
Fade...

606
00:38:37.963 --> 00:38:42.718
- All of this is in the past.
- Aww.


607
00:38:42.801 --> 00:38:45.346
Guy, believe me,
he's a different person now.


608
00:38:45.429 --> 00:38:47.181
‪Aww, what a shame.

609
00:38:47.264 --> 00:38:51.143
He's a different person now. Still yet,
he called her to come here.


610
00:38:51.227 --> 00:38:52.603
Can't you see?

611
00:38:52.686 --> 00:38:56.106
He called her here because he cares
about me, and he was worried about me.


612
00:38:56.815 --> 00:38:58.984
- He was worried about you?
- Yes.


613
00:38:59.610 --> 00:39:00.610
Boma?

614
00:39:00.778 --> 00:39:04.448
Can you not open your eyes and
see what is actually happening here?


615
00:39:04.532 --> 00:39:05.699
Fade, my eyes are open.

616
00:39:05.783 --> 00:39:08.786
They are fully open. Like they
are clear, like a bulb. They are open.


617
00:39:10.871 --> 00:39:14.333
Ah, you are running
a temperature. It's cancer right?


618
00:39:14.959 --> 00:39:17.711
Have you selected the type
you want? Let's go.


619
00:39:18.796 --> 00:39:20.339
My friend with the cancer!

620
00:39:20.422 --> 00:39:21.799
- Let's go there.
- You are mad.


621
00:39:21.882 --> 00:39:25.094
- Cancer-Boma, Boma-cancer, huh?
- You will have cancer. I will slap you


622
00:39:25.177 --> 00:39:27.888
You know cancer patients don't fight.

623
00:39:27.972 --> 00:39:30.724
So you need to be practicing
how to be a "canceric" person.


624
00:39:30.808 --> 00:39:32.768
‪God, which kind of human being is this?

625
00:39:32.851 --> 00:39:35.271
Are you seriously
not going to talk to me right now?


626
00:39:35.354 --> 00:39:37.674
I wasn't planning on it
but now that you've suggested it...


627
00:39:38.399 --> 00:39:40.818
Baby, I was only trying.
To calm things down. You're pregnant


628
00:39:40.901 --> 00:39:42.361
‪By telling me to shut up?

629
00:39:42.444 --> 00:39:45.906
I didn't mean sh... Come on now,
you know Fade would not listen to me.


630
00:39:45.990 --> 00:39:49.076
The only person that
will listen to me here is you, my wife.


631
00:39:49.577 --> 00:39:50.577
Come on.

632
00:39:51.120 --> 00:39:52.705
Fade is a stubborn he-goat!

633
00:39:53.289 --> 00:39:54.456
Glad you mentioned.

634
00:39:56.625 --> 00:39:58.377
Come on, baby, I'm sorry.

635
00:39:58.460 --> 00:40:00.713
- I'm sorry. You know I'll be...
- Leave me!


636
00:40:00.796 --> 00:40:02.506
I'll never do anything to hurt you.

637
00:40:03.048 --> 00:40:06.468
I didn't want to make
you feel like this. I would not do that.


638
00:40:08.429 --> 00:40:09.430
Baby...

639
00:40:10.514 --> 00:40:11.515
My husband.

640
00:40:12.266 --> 00:40:16.854
- Leave me! Leave me, stop.
- My husband, my husband.


641
00:40:16.937 --> 00:40:19.523
You know I won't
stop until you answer me.

642
00:40:19.607 --> 00:40:21.233
- I will not say it
- You won't say it?


643
00:40:21.317 --> 00:40:22.735
- Mm-mm.
- Okay, I'll continue.


644
00:40:22.818 --> 00:40:24.361
- Stop. Stop.
- My husband. Say it.


645
00:40:25.195 --> 00:40:25.946
No.

646
00:40:26.030 --> 00:40:27.823
- My...
- Fine.


647
00:40:28.532 --> 00:40:31.160
- My wife.
- Say it again.


648
00:40:31.243 --> 00:40:34.079
- No.
- Come on.


649
00:40:34.163 --> 00:40:37.625
- My wife, okay?
- Uh! I love you.


650
00:40:37.708 --> 00:40:39.960
I swear our child
is going to come out confused,


651
00:40:40.044 --> 00:40:44.006
- hearing us call ourselves these names.
- Whatever. But listen,


652
00:40:44.089 --> 00:40:45.942
when we get
to that bridge, we'll cross it, okay?


653
00:40:45.966 --> 00:40:49.970
Right now, my husband,
alright come, come, come.


654
00:40:50.054 --> 00:40:52.097
Come to daddy. 
Come here now.

655
00:40:52.765 --> 00:40:53.765
Get some sugar.

656
00:40:57.269 --> 00:40:58.812
I'm worried about Boma.

657
00:40:59.772 --> 00:41:01.982
- What if she doesn't make it?
- Ahn-ahn, babe.


658
00:41:02.066 --> 00:41:04.109
God willing,
she's going to make it, okay?


659
00:41:09.365 --> 00:41:10.908
She's going to be fine.

660
00:41:10.991 --> 00:41:13.994
- I'm just really worried.
- Don't worry. It'll be fine.


661
00:41:16.538 --> 00:41:18.207
Wow.

662
00:41:18.290 --> 00:41:19.875
I know. She's impressive.

663
00:41:19.958 --> 00:41:22.678
I mean, does she know that
you're selling her like goods in a market?


664
00:41:23.212 --> 00:41:27.132
- I think that is my time...
- Sorry, sorry. Listen, just joking.


665
00:41:29.093 --> 00:41:32.137
- You know I don't have to do this, right?
- I know.


666
00:41:32.221 --> 00:41:33.514
You made quite an impression.

667
00:41:33.597 --> 00:41:36.600
She doesn't
get attracted to people so easily.


668
00:41:37.101 --> 00:41:38.268
I know.

669
00:41:38.352 --> 00:41:39.978
That's the "Xavier effect."

670
00:41:40.771 --> 00:41:43.148
Hmm, you are just a naughty person.

671
00:41:43.816 --> 00:41:44.816
Hit me again.

672
00:41:45.693 --> 00:41:48.195
If you flirt with me one more time,

673
00:41:48.278 --> 00:41:49.571
I am going to leave.

674
00:41:49.655 --> 00:41:51.532
Alright, sorry, sorry.

675
00:41:53.450 --> 00:41:54.660
But why though?

676
00:41:55.160 --> 00:41:56.160
Why what?

677
00:41:56.370 --> 00:41:58.872
Why are you so hell-bent
on getting me a girlfriend?


678
00:41:59.832 --> 00:42:01.500
You asked for my help.

679
00:42:02.209 --> 00:42:03.752
No.

680
00:42:04.795 --> 00:42:06.130
No. I asked for you, Donna.

681
00:42:09.550 --> 00:42:12.094
I've told you one million times, Xavier,

682
00:42:13.554 --> 00:42:16.890
Miss Donna Okafor, now Mrs. Jabal.

683
00:42:16.974 --> 00:42:19.309
- I am married.
- Don't remind me.


684
00:42:20.769 --> 00:42:23.188
I still can't get over how fast
he snatched you from me.


685
00:42:23.856 --> 00:42:27.526
Um. Well, if you didn't let
a good thing go in the first place,


686
00:42:27.609 --> 00:42:28.609
who knows.

687
00:42:28.986 --> 00:42:29.987
Yeah.

688
00:42:30.738 --> 00:42:33.031
It's something that
I regret it every day of my life.


689
00:42:33.782 --> 00:42:37.578
- Azeem is a lucky man.
- And you will be after this date okay?


690
00:42:37.661 --> 00:42:39.538
Just go on this date. 
Give it a shot.

691
00:42:40.038 --> 00:42:42.166
I have a feeling
that you two will hit it off.


692
00:42:42.249 --> 00:42:43.584
‪Yeah, whatever.

693
00:42:44.293 --> 00:42:46.295
- Cheers.
- Cheers.


694
00:42:46.378 --> 00:42:51.759
- Whatever.
- Xavier.


695
00:42:53.594 --> 00:42:55.471
I'll have that, thank you.

696
00:43:00.642 --> 00:43:01.435
- Boma.
- Boma.


697
00:43:01.518 --> 00:43:02.936
- I'm fine now.
- Are you okay?


698
00:43:03.687 --> 00:43:05.689
- Are you fine?
- Yeah.


699
00:43:05.773 --> 00:43:09.443
She's fine now.
You know, just a little throw-up.


700
00:43:09.526 --> 00:43:10.861
Although, very messy. Ah.

701
00:43:10.944 --> 00:43:14.198
- I had to clean the toilet...
- Ah, how did you know I want it?


702
00:43:14.281 --> 00:43:16.881
- It was actually for...
- No, no, just give it to her, it's fine.


703
00:43:16.909 --> 00:43:17.909
Give it to her.

704
00:43:18.994 --> 00:43:20.287
You can have it.

705
00:43:20.370 --> 00:43:22.456
No, no, no. Take.

706
00:43:22.539 --> 00:43:23.582
No, you can have it.

707
00:43:23.665 --> 00:43:26.144
Since you are the one that was thirsty
and he brought it for you.


708
00:43:26.168 --> 00:43:29.213
She said she does not want.
Aunty, carry your drink and go.


709
00:43:29.296 --> 00:43:32.633
- What? What's exactly is it?
- Guys, guys, guys, please.


710
00:43:32.716 --> 00:43:36.553
Please, calm down. Ha!

711
00:43:38.597 --> 00:43:41.266
Boma, I'm sure you must be hungry.

712
00:43:41.975 --> 00:43:42.975
How?

713
00:43:43.519 --> 00:43:46.039
I mean, you just threw up.
And you spent a lot of time in there.


714
00:43:46.730 --> 00:43:48.130
- Yeah, actually.
- You need to eat.


715
00:43:48.607 --> 00:43:51.735
Thinking about it, now that
you say it, I think I'm a little...


716
00:43:53.821 --> 00:43:55.322
I'm a little hungry now.

717
00:43:55.405 --> 00:43:59.034
Yeah, you need to eat
so that you can regain your strength.


718
00:43:59.117 --> 00:44:01.537
- Okay.
- And I have so much discomfort but,


719
00:44:01.620 --> 00:44:04.998
- you know, I...
- Sorry guys, I have to take this call.


720
00:44:05.082 --> 00:44:07.459
How about I warm up
the pepper soup for you, okay?


721
00:44:07.960 --> 00:44:10.021
- Thank you very much.
- You're welcome. That's fine.


722
00:44:10.045 --> 00:44:12.798
Yeah, I'll help. You know,
I mean you always need another hand...


723
00:44:12.881 --> 00:44:13.966
‪Fade will help with that.

724
00:44:14.508 --> 00:44:16.468
She said she was
going to do it already.

725
00:44:17.719 --> 00:44:20.973
- She did? When?
- Right now. Right, Fade?


726
00:44:21.765 --> 00:44:22.808
Eh? You say?

727
00:44:23.392 --> 00:44:26.395
You said you were going
to help Donna warm my food for me.


728
00:44:26.478 --> 00:44:30.065
I did? Oh yeah,
yeah, I did. I did.

729
00:44:30.691 --> 00:44:34.736
- Well, she's going in now so...
- Oh, of course, of course.


730
00:44:43.662 --> 00:44:46.999
Bowls, bowls, bowls. 
Where are the bowls?

731
00:44:52.254 --> 00:44:54.965
- Do you need some help?
- No, thank you.


732
00:45:20.032 --> 00:45:21.074
Are you okay?

733
00:45:22.117 --> 00:45:23.117
Yeah, why?

734
00:45:24.494 --> 00:45:25.662
You look upset.

735
00:45:26.496 --> 00:45:29.666
- No, I'm fine. And you? Are you...
- Sorry about that.


736
00:45:33.795 --> 00:45:35.589
It's okay, man. Work, right?

737
00:45:35.672 --> 00:45:39.384
Yes, work. Can you imagine? I've not
even left this people for one hour,


738
00:45:39.468 --> 00:45:41.762
and they are
already disturbing me. One hour.


739
00:45:41.845 --> 00:45:45.390
These guys can't do the
simple thing they were paid to do.


740
00:45:45.474 --> 00:45:47.893
Really? But it's fine, 
I sorted it out.

741
00:45:48.393 --> 00:45:49.770
Sorry, don't mind them.

742
00:45:50.562 --> 00:45:52.314
You know you don't have to stay, right?

743
00:45:54.274 --> 00:45:56.985
Boma, I can see
you're feeling better but, listen...


744
00:45:57.819 --> 00:45:59.196
In case you don't know,

745
00:46:01.657 --> 00:46:03.200
you're my guy. 
You know that.

746
00:46:03.825 --> 00:46:07.496
And I am not leaving here until
I'm sure you're well taken care of.


747
00:46:08.246 --> 00:46:09.331
- Aww.
- Yeah.


748
00:46:09.915 --> 00:46:12.334
By the way,
I texted an oncologist friend of mine.


749
00:46:12.417 --> 00:46:13.043
‪Ha.

750
00:46:13.126 --> 00:46:15.545
Mm-hmm. He said
he will get back to me in a few minutes.


751
00:46:16.046 --> 00:46:17.526
You have your medical records, right?

752
00:46:18.924 --> 00:46:24.930
Err I... I...
I honestly don't know what to say.


753
00:46:25.013 --> 00:46:26.807
No. MM-mm. You've started.

754
00:46:26.890 --> 00:46:29.976
You don't have to say anything, okay?

755
00:46:30.060 --> 00:46:31.561
That's what friends are for.

756
00:46:36.108 --> 00:46:37.150
‪Oh.

757
00:46:37.234 --> 00:46:38.402
What's wrong with you?

758
00:46:39.528 --> 00:46:40.904
Nothing, I'm good.

759
00:46:44.908 --> 00:46:46.827
So. You didn't know?

760
00:46:50.122 --> 00:46:51.498
About Boma's situation.

761
00:46:53.250 --> 00:46:54.251
No, I did.

762
00:46:54.334 --> 00:46:57.295
- You both are terrible liars.
- And how do you mean?


763
00:46:59.256 --> 00:47:00.256
You know...

764
00:47:00.924 --> 00:47:04.094
I know all about that erm,
meeting you had in the bathroom.


765
00:47:06.680 --> 00:47:10.016
We used to have
those cute moments when we were...


766
00:47:19.901 --> 00:47:20.902
Humor me.

767
00:47:21.445 --> 00:47:26.700
You knew all about her sickness
yet you pretended you don't know.


768
00:47:26.783 --> 00:47:28.660
But she told you it was
okay, so you know...


769
00:47:29.828 --> 00:47:30.829
Am I right?

770
00:47:34.291 --> 00:47:37.419
Spot on. Perfectly, absolutely.

771
00:47:38.211 --> 00:47:41.631
Right. For what it's worth...

772
00:47:42.632 --> 00:47:45.802
I didn't mean for things
to end up the way it ended between us.


773
00:47:46.470 --> 00:47:47.929
Between us?

774
00:47:48.013 --> 00:47:49.013
Boma and I.

775
00:47:49.473 --> 00:47:52.184
Oh come on,
I know she told you all about it.


776
00:47:52.768 --> 00:47:53.852
Yeah, she told me.

777
00:47:54.436 --> 00:47:58.982
She told me how you introduced
her to a guy you already dated...


778
00:47:59.566 --> 00:48:00.734
No, scratch that.

779
00:48:00.817 --> 00:48:04.154
You introduced her to a
guy you had a relationship with,


780
00:48:04.237 --> 00:48:07.407
and you knew still had feelings for you.

781
00:48:07.491 --> 00:48:09.409
Yes, she did.

782
00:48:15.373 --> 00:48:16.373
And the best thing

783
00:48:17.209 --> 00:48:22.297
that you could do was to introduce me
to a man who is still clearly into you.


784
00:48:22.964 --> 00:48:26.301
Because as we all know, nobody loves Boma.

785
00:48:26.384 --> 00:48:29.137
Boma is alone. 
Boma is charity.

786
00:48:29.221 --> 00:48:31.073
Boma is the one that
deserves your hand-me-downs.


787
00:48:31.097 --> 00:48:33.141
That's not true. Boma, I...

788
00:48:34.267 --> 00:48:36.645
I wanted to help. Okay?

789
00:48:37.562 --> 00:48:40.357
You were lonely.
You connected with Xavier so,


790
00:48:40.440 --> 00:48:42.818
I didn't think
it was necessary for me to tell you.


791
00:48:44.110 --> 00:48:47.781
Babe, you should have seen yourself,
you looked so happy. You were in love.


792
00:48:51.868 --> 00:48:52.869
Donna?

793
00:48:54.496 --> 00:48:55.497
Fuck you.

794
00:48:57.249 --> 00:48:58.250
Fuck off.

795
00:48:59.209 --> 00:49:00.502
Go to hell.

796
00:49:01.253 --> 00:49:02.546
Stay in hell.

797
00:49:03.380 --> 00:49:05.215
I don't ever want to see you again.

798
00:49:05.882 --> 00:49:10.887
And please just go before I say
extra things that we will both regret.


799
00:49:11.388 --> 00:49:12.389
I beg you in God's name.

800
00:49:13.139 --> 00:49:16.351
Just go. I made a mistake.
I made a mistake inviting you here.


801
00:49:23.483 --> 00:49:24.985
Babe, I'm sorry, okay?

802
00:49:26.152 --> 00:49:29.781
I'm extremely sorry.
Honestly, I don't know what else to say.


803
00:49:29.865 --> 00:49:30.865
‪Goodbye will suffice.

804
00:49:39.332 --> 00:49:41.209
Well, I mean...

805
00:49:42.460 --> 00:49:43.461
You're here now.

806
00:49:44.921 --> 00:49:48.174
It's the time she needs
you the most. She's not feeling so great.


807
00:49:48.258 --> 00:49:50.552
And you're here
trying to help so, I believe


808
00:49:50.635 --> 00:49:52.596
that should count for something.

809
00:49:54.431 --> 00:49:55.599
How long have you known?

810
00:49:57.017 --> 00:49:58.143
Erm...

811
00:49:58.768 --> 00:50:00.061
About six months now.

812
00:50:02.731 --> 00:50:05.942
She told me she was
diagnosed three months ago.


813
00:50:06.860 --> 00:50:10.739
Yeah, erm, yeah... 
You know she...

814
00:50:11.406 --> 00:50:14.743
She started showing
symptoms about six months ago.


815
00:50:14.826 --> 00:50:15.827
Oh.

816
00:50:17.621 --> 00:50:18.288
For what it's worth,

817
00:50:18.371 --> 00:50:22.626
I'm so sorry that you have to go through
this again with someone you love.


818
00:50:23.376 --> 00:50:24.377
I don't get it?

819
00:50:25.420 --> 00:50:28.214
Oh, I heard about
your mother's diabetic shock last year.


820
00:50:31.968 --> 00:50:38.600
My mom died ten years ago,
of a stroke. Way before I met you.


821
00:50:40.560 --> 00:50:43.772
Wait, where did you get
that information from?


822
00:50:45.774 --> 00:50:46.775
Donna?

823
00:50:49.194 --> 00:50:53.323
I'm sorry, I must have mixed you up
with someone else. Apologies.


824
00:50:59.579 --> 00:51:01.039
Here you go.

825
00:51:01.998 --> 00:51:05.585
- Thank you.
- Be careful, it's still very hot.


826
00:51:06.169 --> 00:51:08.964
You ought to blow it a little bit.
You can still blow, right?


827
00:51:09.047 --> 00:51:10.047
‪You know how to do that.

828
00:51:12.092 --> 00:51:16.596
Er baby, I was just telling Boma
that I spoke to Dr. Ken


829
00:51:16.680 --> 00:51:18.760
- and he's willing to take up her case.
- Great news.


830
00:51:19.557 --> 00:51:21.309
Can I see you in the kitchen, please?

831
00:51:23.687 --> 00:51:28.400
Kitchen, please. 
Kitchen, please.

832
00:51:28.483 --> 00:51:31.486
- What's wrong?
- Azeem! Kitchen, now. Please.


833
00:51:34.656 --> 00:51:37.701
- That was awkward. Even for them.
- Shut up.


834
00:51:38.410 --> 00:51:39.411
What?

835
00:51:50.213 --> 00:51:51.923
I'm here. What's going on?

836
00:51:54.384 --> 00:51:59.014
Okay, you're scaring me now.
What's up, what's happening?


837
00:52:06.062 --> 00:52:07.355
You love me, don't you?

838
00:52:09.190 --> 00:52:12.986
Baby, of course I love you.
I mean, is that really a question?


839
00:52:13.611 --> 00:52:16.364
And you will not deliberately lie to me?

840
00:52:17.574 --> 00:52:19.200
No. Not intentionally.

841
00:52:20.201 --> 00:52:23.747
Intentionally and deliberately are
the same thing. So you would not do that?


842
00:52:24.873 --> 00:52:25.873
Right?

843
00:52:27.250 --> 00:52:29.669
Donna, is there something
you want to say to me?


844
00:52:29.753 --> 00:52:32.047
Or there's something you want to ask me?

845
00:52:39.721 --> 00:52:40.722
Fade...

846
00:52:45.143 --> 00:52:46.143
Fade?

847
00:52:46.561 --> 00:52:50.273
Remember the only time
last year that you came home late?


848
00:52:51.399 --> 00:52:54.402
You came at
about 1:00 a.m., past midnight.


849
00:52:56.071 --> 00:52:58.490
And you told me

850
00:52:59.115 --> 00:53:00.992
that you were at Fade's house.

851
00:53:01.076 --> 00:53:04.329
‪That her mother had developed
‪some sort of diabetic shock,


852
00:53:04.954 --> 00:53:08.833
- and you were there to help.
- Mm-hmm.


853
00:53:19.344 --> 00:53:23.348
You know it's funny because
Fade and I, we had a conversation.


854
00:53:25.308 --> 00:53:27.977
And she revealed something quite unusual.

855
00:53:29.854 --> 00:53:30.854
Hmm.

856
00:53:34.317 --> 00:53:38.238
She revealed that
her mother had died ten years ago.


857
00:53:40.115 --> 00:53:46.496
Oh, exactly my reaction when she told me.

858
00:53:50.792 --> 00:53:54.963
I... I don't... I mean,
these things happen. Babe, I mean...


859
00:53:55.046 --> 00:53:58.007
You really didn't...
are we having a conversation about this?


860
00:53:58.091 --> 00:54:00.176
This thing could have
been anything. Probably,


861
00:54:00.260 --> 00:54:04.597
- I meant her aunt, not her mom.
- Exactly what I thought!


862
00:54:04.681 --> 00:54:06.808
‪I thought there was a miscommunication.

863
00:54:07.517 --> 00:54:11.062
You might have meant her mother,
or her aunty, right? Her aunty.


864
00:54:12.021 --> 00:54:14.649
I thought the exact same thing.

865
00:54:15.567 --> 00:54:20.155
But then I remembered I had a conversation
with Boma, and she had told me that Fade


866
00:54:20.238 --> 00:54:24.826
does not have any
other relative except her mother.


867
00:54:27.579 --> 00:54:28.579
Hmm.

868
00:54:29.455 --> 00:54:33.042
I mean, is there something
you're trying to ask me?


869
00:54:37.130 --> 00:54:39.257
Al
-Azeem Jabal.

870
00:54:42.177 --> 00:54:44.846
What exactly happened that night?

871
00:54:47.640 --> 00:54:51.394
I don't remember. I don't know
what you are talking about. What night?


872
00:54:52.187 --> 00:54:53.855
What, exactly?!

873
00:54:56.274 --> 00:54:59.128
- What exactly happened that night, Jabal?
- What do you want me to say to...


874
00:54:59.152 --> 00:55:00.236
You're a fucking...!

875
00:55:02.655 --> 00:55:07.827
The truth. The truth, Jabal.
What exactly happened that night?


876
00:55:09.412 --> 00:55:11.372
- The truth?
- The truth.


877
00:55:11.456 --> 00:55:17.128
Donna, come on, are you really
doing this right here? Right now?


878
00:55:18.171 --> 00:55:19.797
I mean, we're here to support a friend.

879
00:55:19.881 --> 00:55:21.299
‪-Our friend.
‪-Okay.


880
00:55:21.799 --> 00:55:25.261
Who might be dying, by the way,
and all you can think about


881
00:55:25.345 --> 00:55:30.058
is... is asking for details
of one random night.


882
00:55:30.600 --> 00:55:32.727
- Really?
- Don't you dare!


883
00:55:33.269 --> 00:55:37.815
Don't you dare, Jabal!
Don't you ever make me feel unreasonable!


884
00:55:37.899 --> 00:55:42.946
Don't you dare! Don't try me!
Don't test me, Jabal! Don't try it.


885
00:55:43.029 --> 00:55:43.863
‪I'm not... you're doing this to yourself.

886
00:55:43.947 --> 00:55:47.116
You are the one being unreasonable, not
telling me exactly what happened.


887
00:55:47.200 --> 00:55:50.203
What happened that night Jabal?
Don't play with me.


888
00:55:50.286 --> 00:55:52.431
‪-Don't play with...!
‪-Do you want me to tell you something...?


889
00:55:52.455 --> 00:55:53.855
‪What happened that fucking night?!

890
00:55:56.084 --> 00:55:58.753
Something that fucking
happened 12, 13 months ago?


891
00:55:58.836 --> 00:56:01.714
‪-What do you mean my money to play, or...
‪-What happened?!


892
00:56:02.840 --> 00:56:03.841
It's delicious.

893
00:56:04.926 --> 00:56:06.803
Tell me what happened that night?

894
00:56:07.303 --> 00:56:10.598
- Sorry, what did you say?
- The pepper soup, it's...


895
00:56:12.642 --> 00:56:15.937
- It's delicious, thank you.
- You're welcome.


896
00:56:16.020 --> 00:56:17.689
‪You don't have amnesia.

897
00:56:17.772 --> 00:56:22.026
You know what, Donna, I'm not doing this.
Not here, not right now, and not today.


898
00:56:22.110 --> 00:56:23.712
- I'm not...
- You know exactly what you what to do?


899
00:56:23.736 --> 00:56:27.240
- You don't want to tell me what happened...
- I already... I told you.


900
00:56:28.408 --> 00:56:30.493
Listen, I think someone
should go check up on them.


901
00:56:30.576 --> 00:56:32.662
I think you should mind your business.

902
00:56:32.745 --> 00:56:38.251
Guys, guys, they are a couple.
Couples argue all the time.


903
00:56:39.043 --> 00:56:42.338
I think it's normal.
Let's not just... you know...


904
00:56:42.880 --> 00:56:43.880
Yeah, you're right.

905
00:56:45.717 --> 00:56:51.973
- That was long time ago!
- Jabal, what happened that night?


906
00:56:53.433 --> 00:56:54.433
Who is that?!

907
00:57:01.316 --> 00:57:04.652
Wow. Why am I not surprised?

908
00:57:05.695 --> 00:57:06.237
Really?

909
00:57:06.321 --> 00:57:08.924
‪I heard some shouting outside so
‪I wanted to know if everything is cool.


910
00:57:08.948 --> 00:57:10.992
- Ah...
- Thank you, Mr. Clown. Now, get out!


911
00:57:11.075 --> 00:57:12.594
- Azeem!
- No, no, it's fine. It's fine.


912
00:57:12.618 --> 00:57:15.496
I mean, as long as everyone is okay...

913
00:57:16.039 --> 00:57:21.377
Well, as you can see,
everyone is okay, Mr. Super Hero.


914
00:57:22.086 --> 00:57:25.381
She's having
a conversation with her husband.


915
00:57:25.465 --> 00:57:27.884
If you don't mind, get out!

916
00:57:27.967 --> 00:57:31.304
- Is everything fine?
- This guy...


917
00:57:31.387 --> 00:57:35.600
Can you be more shameless?
Don't you have any sort of shame?


918
00:57:36.851 --> 00:57:38.311
Are you okay?

919
00:57:39.062 --> 00:57:44.776
No, no no. Are you okay or did you develop
some form of trauma growing up as a child,


920
00:57:44.859 --> 00:57:48.613
that has made you develop
some sort of fetish for married women?


921
00:57:48.696 --> 00:57:50.615
Or is my wife just
one of the lucky ones?

922
00:57:50.698 --> 00:57:53.117
- Azeem, stop it!
- Don't tell me to stop it.


923
00:57:53.660 --> 00:57:55.495
Let's call a spade a spade.

924
00:57:55.578 --> 00:58:00.708
This guy, this bastard is obsessed
with you, and it's pathetic to watch!


925
00:58:01.334 --> 00:58:03.127
- Azeem.
- Ah Donna, come on.


926
00:58:03.211 --> 00:58:05.213
‪You can do better than this broke...

927
00:58:05.296 --> 00:58:07.882
- Argh!
- Ah!


928
00:58:08.466 --> 00:58:11.469
‪Please. Please. 
What is wrong with you?!

929
00:58:12.261 --> 00:58:16.391
What is wrong with you, Azeem?!
What exactly is wrong with you?


930
00:58:17.058 --> 00:58:19.102
Really? What is wrong with me?

931
00:58:19.185 --> 00:58:21.437
‪What is wrong with you?
‪What is wrong with you?


932
00:58:21.521 --> 00:58:25.858
You would pick sides?
With that fool? Over me?


933
00:58:26.484 --> 00:58:30.405
Because I decided to skip one
very tiny detail of a random night?


934
00:58:30.488 --> 00:58:32.657
‪-I am not picking sides.
‪-So what are you doing?


935
00:58:32.740 --> 00:58:35.576
I am not picking sides, Azeem.
What is wrong with you?!


936
00:58:37.286 --> 00:58:40.957
Fine, you wanna find out?
No, you wanna know the truth? Then, fine.


937
00:58:41.874 --> 00:58:48.256
- I'll lead you directly to the answer.
- Azeem! Azeem, where are you... Azeem!


938
00:58:48.339 --> 00:58:49.757
- Don't tell me to stop!
- Stop.


939
00:58:49.841 --> 00:58:53.010
Don't, don't. You wanna know the truth?

940
00:58:53.094 --> 00:58:55.012
Then let's settle
this thing once and for all.


941
00:58:55.096 --> 00:58:56.305
‪Guys, what's going on?

942
00:58:56.389 --> 00:58:58.725
- Ahn-ahn. Fade.
- Er... Azeem.


943
00:58:59.517 --> 00:59:02.019
Do you remember one time
when you stayed over at my office?


944
00:59:02.103 --> 00:59:03.688
- Yeah.
- I mean, we had some work to do


945
00:59:03.771 --> 00:59:05.051
‪and you stayed the whole night?

946
00:59:05.148 --> 00:59:10.528
Er... Yeah. I think so, when I came to you
for help on my job interview, right?


947
00:59:10.611 --> 00:59:11.611
Yes.

948
00:59:11.988 --> 00:59:13.406
Oh wait, she thought...

949
00:59:17.493 --> 00:59:18.493
Woah!

950
00:59:18.911 --> 00:59:22.206
Hey Aunty, I'm not
doing anything with your husband.


951
00:59:22.790 --> 00:59:26.711
I had a job interview, I had to seek help
from him, and I had to wait


952
00:59:26.794 --> 00:59:28.671
until he was done with work.

953
00:59:28.755 --> 00:59:30.555
Hence the reason
we finished so late at night.


954
00:59:31.048 --> 00:59:32.091
And that's all.

955
00:59:32.175 --> 00:59:34.677
‪That doesn't change the fact
‪that you lied to me about it.


956
00:59:34.761 --> 00:59:36.929
- Why?
- Because of this.


957
00:59:37.430 --> 00:59:40.600
Because of this. I knew you wouldn't
believe if I told you the truth.


958
00:59:40.683 --> 00:59:43.728
So I had to tell you something that
you wouldn't be able to counter, Donna.


959
00:59:44.395 --> 00:59:45.104
Ahn-ahn.

960
00:59:45.188 --> 00:59:49.275
That's my problem with you,
you get paranoid at the slightest thing.


961
00:59:49.901 --> 00:59:52.821
Please you need to stop with this
your insecurity issues. I'm tired of it.


962
00:59:52.862 --> 00:59:54.697
- Oh, now I'm insecure.
- Yes!


963
00:59:54.781 --> 00:59:57.617
- I'm insecure?
- Who would have thought that little miss...


964
00:59:57.700 --> 01:00:00.703
- Hey, shut up. Shut it.
- No, no, darling!


965
01:00:00.787 --> 01:00:03.790
- Do not caution your whore! No need.
- Huh?!


966
01:00:03.873 --> 01:00:05.124
- Who is a whore?
- You!


967
01:00:05.208 --> 01:00:07.335
- Who's talking? Hold her!
- My darling, you!


968
01:00:07.418 --> 01:00:09.962
‪-I will scratch you! What?!
‪-Can you just stop it now?


969
01:00:10.046 --> 01:00:11.398
- No need for all this. Just sit down.
- You and who? Please!


970
01:00:11.422 --> 01:00:13.022
‪-You'll do nothing.
‪-Just stop, please.


971
01:00:13.049 --> 01:00:13.966
You won't dare.

972
01:00:14.050 --> 01:00:15.635
- Stop it.
- I know about you two.


973
01:00:16.302 --> 01:00:17.302
- Rubbish.
- I do!


974
01:00:17.720 --> 01:00:20.932
But I chose to keep quiet
because of my insecurities, right?


975
01:00:21.015 --> 01:00:25.144
Maybe that night you two did not sleep
with each other but I know, Jabal,


976
01:00:25.228 --> 01:00:27.730
that you two
have been fucking. Right, Boma?


977
01:00:27.814 --> 01:00:30.817
- Really? Abom-bom, right?
- Oh, shut up!


978
01:00:30.900 --> 01:00:32.235
‪Ah, I'll beat this girl up.

979
01:00:33.361 --> 01:00:34.904
‪-Boma?
‪-I'll beat this girl up.


980
01:00:35.404 --> 01:00:38.533
Did you tell my wife
that Fade and I were fucking?


981
01:00:57.635 --> 01:00:58.636
Boma?

982
01:00:59.720 --> 01:01:01.722
You told my wife
I was sleeping with Fade?

983
01:01:06.727 --> 01:01:11.899
Azeem, how can you ask me that type
of question? Are you sleeping with Fade?


984
01:01:11.983 --> 01:01:16.988
Guys listen, I think the civil thing is to
not have this conversation here and now.


985
01:01:17.071 --> 01:01:20.575
Says the wildling who just tried
to punch me a few minutes ago.


986
01:01:20.658 --> 01:01:22.338
You almost beat up
your wife in the kitchen


987
01:01:22.410 --> 01:01:24.954
‪and look at you seated there
‪intimidating a sick woman.


988
01:01:25.037 --> 01:01:25.705
And you call me a wildling?

989
01:01:25.788 --> 01:01:27.331
- Excuse me...
- No, no, no, listen.


990
01:01:28.040 --> 01:01:31.335
Now I know you do not
deserve Donna. You don't deserve her.


991
01:01:31.419 --> 01:01:32.795
I mean, it's obvious.

992
01:01:33.504 --> 01:01:37.633
No one asked for your opinion,
you bald-headed looking monkey.


993
01:01:38.634 --> 01:01:42.555
All I'm trying to say is that you do
not address your wife in public like that.


994
01:01:43.222 --> 01:01:44.473
Have some respect.

995
01:01:47.643 --> 01:01:49.937
I could have really
taken your opinion to heart, only...


996
01:01:50.897 --> 01:01:55.318
Um, the only problem here is that I know
it's coming from a place of desperation.


997
01:01:56.360 --> 01:01:58.112
- Desperation?
- Yes.


998
01:01:58.195 --> 01:01:59.655
You call me desperate?

999
01:01:59.739 --> 01:02:05.411
As desperate as a man who tried to pay his
wife's ex, six million to leave her alone?


1000
01:02:05.494 --> 01:02:08.454
Because she could obviously not do
it herself, is that what you are saying?


1001
01:02:10.833 --> 01:02:14.211
Wait, Azeem did you pay him
just so that he could stay away from me?


1002
01:02:15.713 --> 01:02:19.759
- Azeem?
- Here's how things are gonna play out.


1003
01:02:20.509 --> 01:02:22.136
You'll stop talking to my wife.

1004
01:02:23.429 --> 01:02:25.723
You'll stop texting my wife.

1005
01:02:25.806 --> 01:02:29.560
In fact, you will end every
form of communication you have with her.


1006
01:02:30.645 --> 01:02:32.647
And I mean every form of communication.

1007
01:02:32.730 --> 01:02:35.024
‪You will not mistakenly
‪bump into my wife at the mall.


1008
01:02:35.107 --> 01:02:36.776
You will stop that nonsense.

1009
01:02:37.610 --> 01:02:40.905
You will not like
her pictures on social media. In fact...


1010
01:02:41.697 --> 01:02:45.785
she does not exist to you.
Does that make sense?


1011
01:02:48.704 --> 01:02:49.705
What if I say no?

1012
01:02:50.539 --> 01:02:51.999
You won't.

1013
01:02:53.084 --> 01:02:54.669
And you know this because?

1014
01:03:00.675 --> 01:03:01.968
Because I have what you need.

1015
01:03:08.015 --> 01:03:09.225
But I refused.

1016
01:03:09.809 --> 01:03:10.809
Why?

1017
01:03:12.520 --> 01:03:13.560
Why, what do you mean why?

1018
01:03:14.021 --> 01:03:16.482
- Why didn't you collect it?
- Boma, really?


1019
01:03:19.151 --> 01:03:21.737
Six million naira is a lot of money.

1020
01:03:21.821 --> 01:03:25.574
And if I remember clearly,
you weren't exactly swimming in cash.


1021
01:03:25.658 --> 01:03:28.869
So why didn't you collect it
to stay away from her?


1022
01:03:29.578 --> 01:03:31.264
Well, I thought it was
the right thing to do, I guess.


1023
01:03:31.288 --> 01:03:31.872
‪Hey!

1024
01:03:31.956 --> 01:03:33.916
Or is it because
you are still in love with her?


1025
01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:35.376
‪I'm not in love with her.

1026
01:03:35.960 --> 01:03:37.878
- I'm not.
- Eh? Uncle, do like this.


1027
01:03:39.005 --> 01:03:41.125
Exactly. There's lie there.
There's lie in your mouth.


1028
01:03:41.632 --> 01:03:43.926
You think we are blind?
You think we cannot see?


1029
01:03:44.427 --> 01:03:47.179
Hello, you are still
obsessed with this woman.


1030
01:03:47.263 --> 01:03:48.848
‪I am not obsessed with anybody.

1031
01:03:50.683 --> 01:03:54.812
Ahn-ahn. So how do you explain when
yourself and Boma, you are on the bed,


1032
01:03:54.895 --> 01:03:57.565
you're doing "jiggy-down"
and you're still there shouting,


1033
01:03:57.648 --> 01:03:59.275
"Donna, Donna, 
Donna." Explain.

1034
01:04:02.570 --> 01:04:06.657
Donna. Donna.

1035
01:04:08.909 --> 01:04:13.914
- Donna.
- Get the fuck off me! What the F?!


1036
01:04:16.959 --> 01:04:19.879
What the actual fuck?!

1037
01:04:21.338 --> 01:04:25.593
No, I can't believe this.
I can't believe this.


1038
01:04:25.676 --> 01:04:27.053
‪-Baby.
‪-I can't believe this.


1039
01:04:27.136 --> 01:04:29.180
- Baby listen, I can explain.
- Explain?!


1040
01:04:31.140 --> 01:04:32.140
You can explain what?

1041
01:04:33.309 --> 01:04:36.604
That you are calling my best friend's
name right in the middle of coitus!


1042
01:04:37.188 --> 01:04:38.230
It was just a slip.

1043
01:04:38.314 --> 01:04:42.735
‪lt was just a slip of what?
‪Slip of fucking tongue?!


1044
01:04:45.654 --> 01:04:48.074
Wow, you must think
I'm a fool. Get off!

1045
01:04:48.616 --> 01:04:50.216
- You must think I'm a fool, right?
- No.


1046
01:04:50.910 --> 01:04:56.916
Xavier. Xavier, a slip of tongue is when
you call your teacher "mummy" at school.


1047
01:04:56.999 --> 01:05:00.628
A slip of tongue
is when you are drunk,

1048
01:05:00.711 --> 01:05:02.797
‪and you forget the lyrics
‪to your favorite song.


1049
01:05:02.880 --> 01:05:04.465
A slip of tongue

1050
01:05:04.548 --> 01:05:07.802
is when you greet your neighbour
good morning as opposed to good afternoon.


1051
01:05:08.469 --> 01:05:09.470
But this?

1052
01:05:11.305 --> 01:05:14.809
What you have just done,
what you just said...


1053
01:05:18.646 --> 01:05:22.858
Just shows what is really on your mind.

1054
01:05:23.400 --> 01:05:25.736
- Better still, who...
- Boma...


1055
01:05:26.779 --> 01:05:29.865
It's Donna, Donna, Donna!

1056
01:05:37.998 --> 01:05:38.998
What?!

1057
01:05:39.375 --> 01:05:44.296
Boma, I thought
I begged you not to tell anybody?


1058
01:05:44.380 --> 01:05:46.048
- Hello, hello?
- I didn't.


1059
01:05:46.132 --> 01:05:48.217
Hello? Wait. No, just calm down.

1060
01:05:48.300 --> 01:05:51.470
Look here Mr.,
she owes you no explanation.


1061
01:05:51.554 --> 01:05:54.515
She can tell
anybody anything that she wants.


1062
01:05:54.598 --> 01:05:55.349
She can tell her mommy,

1063
01:05:55.432 --> 01:05:58.978
she can tell her sister, she can even tell
her motherfucking pastor. You!


1064
01:05:59.061 --> 01:06:00.688
This same human being,

1065
01:06:00.771 --> 01:06:03.458
you'll be lying next to you in bed
and you'll still be texting this one!


1066
01:06:03.482 --> 01:06:06.861
And that one too will just lie there
like a vegetable, waiting to be touched!


1067
01:06:06.944 --> 01:06:07.945
This same you...

1068
01:06:09.655 --> 01:06:10.990
You cancel dates on her,

1069
01:06:11.073 --> 01:06:13.325
just because you want to
go and hang out. Just to hang.


1070
01:06:13.409 --> 01:06:15.119
Uncle, hang in there then. No problem.

1071
01:06:15.202 --> 01:06:17.830
- Fade, come on.
- Ah. Okay, I should not say it?


1072
01:06:18.497 --> 01:06:21.750
So Donna, you two were seeing each other?

1073
01:06:21.834 --> 01:06:23.127
‪But babe...

1074
01:06:24.420 --> 01:06:28.424
Babe, listen to me.
He... he... it was, it was...


1075
01:06:28.507 --> 01:06:32.261
It was just... he booked a session.

1076
01:06:33.262 --> 01:06:36.223
Hmm. Session? Or "sessions-es"?

1077
01:06:36.307 --> 01:06:42.396
He booked a life
coaching session. That's all.


1078
01:06:44.190 --> 01:06:47.651
Sorry, Aunty,
the life coaching "sessions-es,"


1079
01:06:47.735 --> 01:06:50.654
does it include him texting you,
begging you to take him back?


1080
01:06:50.738 --> 01:06:51.822
‪Fade, shut up!

1081
01:06:51.906 --> 01:06:52.531
- What?!
- Shut up!


1082
01:06:52.615 --> 01:06:54.200
I should shut up?

1083
01:06:54.283 --> 01:06:56.535
Oh. Is that how
you speak to a woman that is


1084
01:06:56.619 --> 01:06:58.913
‪constantly satisfying your sexual palate?

1085
01:07:00.164 --> 01:07:01.164
Please.

1086
01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:04.001
Please!

1087
01:07:04.835 --> 01:07:05.836
What?

1088
01:07:06.462 --> 01:07:10.841
Azeem. Please, enlighten me.

1089
01:07:11.967 --> 01:07:15.512
This "palate" is lost on me.
What's she talking about?


1090
01:07:16.305 --> 01:07:20.559
- Baby, you don't need to...
- Start talking.


1091
01:07:21.560 --> 01:07:24.396
Don't listen to what Fade has to say.
Just focus on us, okay? Please.


1092
01:07:24.480 --> 01:07:25.522
‪Boma.

1093
01:07:26.232 --> 01:07:29.318
You were going through
my phone? You read my messages?


1094
01:07:29.944 --> 01:07:31.320
Please what's wrong with him?

1095
01:07:31.403 --> 01:07:33.364
Why are you trying
to make this about her?

1096
01:07:33.447 --> 01:07:37.451
All of this won't be happening if you
were honest with her from the start!


1097
01:07:38.035 --> 01:07:39.035
Get out of my sight.

1098
01:07:40.537 --> 01:07:44.291
- So you were still talking to this guy?
- Oh, I can explain.


1099
01:07:44.375 --> 01:07:45.375
Can you?

1100
01:07:45.834 --> 01:07:48.939
But you told me he was the one disturbing
you and that you didn't care about him.


1101
01:07:48.963 --> 01:07:50.464
He was. I don't care.

1102
01:07:52.091 --> 01:07:56.387
- So all the work stuff... the work stuff...
- It was work.


1103
01:07:57.304 --> 01:08:01.016
- It was work.
- Really? Work stuff.


1104
01:08:02.017 --> 01:08:04.144
Work stuff, I swear.

1105
01:08:04.853 --> 01:08:07.958
Well pardon me if I don't believe any word
that comes out of your mouth right now.


1106
01:08:07.982 --> 01:08:09.775
It is the truth, unlike you.

1107
01:08:12.069 --> 01:08:13.070
And you!

1108
01:08:15.197 --> 01:08:17.199
- Azeem.
- What kind of man are you?


1109
01:08:17.283 --> 01:08:17.908
- Azeem.
- Eh?


1110
01:08:17.992 --> 01:08:19.994
‪What kind of man pines
‪after another man's wife?


1111
01:08:20.995 --> 01:08:22.454
Don't you have any shame?

1112
01:08:23.414 --> 01:08:26.458
- Azeem.
- Don't "Azeem" me. Don't!


1113
01:08:27.459 --> 01:08:30.188
What is it that you talking with
this guy that you couldn't talk with me?


1114
01:08:30.212 --> 01:08:31.672
Your husband.

1115
01:08:34.216 --> 01:08:38.012
You know what? I'm done with your...
your...


1116
01:08:38.095 --> 01:08:39.221
nonsense side comments.

1117
01:08:39.888 --> 01:08:43.076
What's your problem? If you have anything
to say, open your dirty mouth and say it.


1118
01:08:43.100 --> 01:08:48.439
No! Do not say
a word. Don't talk. Eh?

1119
01:08:49.773 --> 01:08:55.571
Please. Azeem, let's go.
Let's go. Oh my goodness. Let's go.


1120
01:08:56.405 --> 01:09:00.826
- Azeem... Azeem.
- Wow. You can actually be silent.


1121
01:09:03.871 --> 01:09:07.291
You know, I honestly
took you for a whole lot of things but...


1122
01:09:08.167 --> 01:09:09.167
A coward?

1123
01:09:09.460 --> 01:09:10.460
No.

1124
01:09:13.213 --> 01:09:16.091
- As cowardly as you hitting your wife?
- Ah!


1125
01:09:18.302 --> 01:09:21.221
- What is he talking about?
- Xavier.


1126
01:09:23.932 --> 01:09:25.768
- What is he talking about?
- Huh?


1127
01:09:25.851 --> 01:09:29.563
He's not saying anything. Xavier.

1128
01:09:29.646 --> 01:09:34.151
He didn't say anything. He doesn't know
what he's saying. He's talking nonsense.


1129
01:09:34.234 --> 01:09:37.255
No, I'm talking about you hitting your
wife, and her coming to me for comfort.


1130
01:09:37.279 --> 01:09:38.279
You keep quiet.

1131
01:09:39.698 --> 01:09:42.659
- Azeem... is it true?
- Hmm.


1132
01:09:46.497 --> 01:09:50.876
Azeem. Is it true?

1133
01:09:50.959 --> 01:09:53.295
Boma, Boma, Boma, you know me.

1134
01:09:53.379 --> 01:09:55.756
You know me longer
than anybody in this room.


1135
01:09:55.839 --> 01:09:57.591
You know I wouldn't do anything like that.

1136
01:09:57.674 --> 01:09:59.676
I would not. It's not in my character.

1137
01:09:59.760 --> 01:10:03.180
This guy is just talking nonsense.
He's just trying to score cheap points.


1138
01:10:03.263 --> 01:10:05.849
I'm not talking nonsense,
I'm saying everything as...-


1139
01:10:05.933 --> 01:10:06.850
‪Shut up! Shut up

1140
01:10:06.934 --> 01:10:09.770
Shut up, shut up. Shut up.

1141
01:10:10.938 --> 01:10:12.272
I know what I'm talking about.

1142
01:10:12.898 --> 01:10:16.110
I mean, all I'm saying is that your wife
came to me and she told me everything.


1143
01:10:17.861 --> 01:10:18.861
So it's true?

1144
01:10:19.780 --> 01:10:23.617
You hit Donna, like how?
It's unaccepta... how?


1145
01:10:24.827 --> 01:10:28.372
I know, I'm sorry.
But it was a mistake. It was just once.


1146
01:10:28.455 --> 01:10:33.293
I promise you, just once.
And I apologized immediately it happened.


1147
01:10:34.586 --> 01:10:38.549
Are you... just once.
Are you... you don't do that.


1148
01:10:40.509 --> 01:10:42.344
My God.

1149
01:10:43.220 --> 01:10:44.221
Donna.

1150
01:10:47.850 --> 01:10:51.728
- What the fuck?
- He's never beaten me.


1151
01:10:52.646 --> 01:10:54.314
Fade, shut up.

1152
01:10:58.944 --> 01:11:01.363
- Hey.
- Don't you dare!


1153
01:11:02.614 --> 01:11:04.908
You know I would
never do anything to hurt you.


1154
01:11:04.992 --> 01:11:06.618
‪ls that what we're talking about?

1155
01:11:12.124 --> 01:11:15.127
- Fade and I happened a long time ago.
- When?


1156
01:11:16.128 --> 01:11:20.174
Before you and I...
before we became serious.


1157
01:11:20.257 --> 01:11:22.301
- And after?
- Nothing.


1158
01:11:22.843 --> 01:11:25.387
Nothing, totally.
We are just friends. I swear.


1159
01:11:26.930 --> 01:11:28.390
Why would you say that I'm insecure?

1160
01:11:29.475 --> 01:11:31.727
We both know who the guilty party is.

1161
01:11:33.187 --> 01:11:34.307
I was just talking nonsense.

1162
01:11:35.898 --> 01:11:37.191
I am the insecure bagger.

1163
01:11:39.193 --> 01:11:43.614
You know I can't even believe that you'd
pay off Xavier just to stay away from me.


1164
01:11:44.698 --> 01:11:47.826
- But I did it because I wanted...
- Don't you dare say for me.


1165
01:11:47.910 --> 01:11:50.704
We both know
you did it for yourself, for your ego!


1166
01:11:51.872 --> 01:11:52.872
Not for me.

1167
01:11:55.042 --> 01:11:56.043
No.

1168
01:11:57.461 --> 01:12:01.089
Baby, I did it because...
because I love you.


1169
01:12:01.715 --> 01:12:03.634
I love you so much.

1170
01:12:05.594 --> 01:12:06.594
I'm sorry.

1171
01:12:09.056 --> 01:12:10.056
Please.

1172
01:12:20.984 --> 01:12:22.945
Sorry.

1173
01:12:32.287 --> 01:12:33.288
Azeem...

1174
01:12:34.122 --> 01:12:35.123
Hmm?

1175
01:12:39.586 --> 01:12:41.129
Talk to me, please.

1176
01:12:55.269 --> 01:12:56.270
Erm...

1177
01:13:01.024 --> 01:13:02.526
There's something else.

1178
01:13:05.654 --> 01:13:08.174
Did I send you to go and be telling all
those things you were telling err, Donna?


1179
01:13:08.198 --> 01:13:09.198
Did I send you?

1180
01:13:09.992 --> 01:13:11.994
Please don't be angry. Please.

1181
01:13:13.370 --> 01:13:14.955
It's okay, sweetie.

1182
01:13:15.038 --> 01:13:17.874
That girl she's a very
shameful girl. Very shameless.


1183
01:13:17.958 --> 01:13:18.709
‪Fade!

1184
01:13:18.792 --> 01:13:20.460
- What? What do you mean?
- It's okay.


1185
01:13:20.544 --> 01:13:22.522
All those things that she's talking
about, that's since last year.


1186
01:13:22.546 --> 01:13:26.300
And I'm even over the guy,
unlike some people. Mario!


1187
01:13:26.383 --> 01:13:27.884
They will rather die than leave!

1188
01:13:30.095 --> 01:13:31.305
- Fade!
- Ahn-ahn.


1189
01:13:32.222 --> 01:13:35.017
Wait, these people... 
Two times in one day?

1190
01:13:37.352 --> 01:13:38.353
Fade.

1191
01:13:39.146 --> 01:13:40.832
Come and sit down.
It's none of your business.


1192
01:13:40.856 --> 01:13:41.940
‪These guys, they're angry.

1193
01:13:43.775 --> 01:13:44.775
Come and sit down.

1194
01:13:45.193 --> 01:13:46.695
- Fade.
- Boma, are you okay?


1195
01:13:48.905 --> 01:13:49.906
Wow.

1196
01:13:50.657 --> 01:13:51.867
Now, you see me.

1197
01:13:52.534 --> 01:13:54.077
Now, you notice me.

1198
01:13:54.870 --> 01:13:55.871
Good morning.

1199
01:13:57.497 --> 01:13:58.665
Do you want me to leave?

1200
01:13:58.749 --> 01:14:00.917
Goodness!

1201
01:14:01.001 --> 01:14:02.961
Ladies and gentlemen,

1202
01:14:03.045 --> 01:14:06.965
‪the first smart thing that will
‪come out of this cow-tail's mouth!


1203
01:14:07.049 --> 01:14:09.384
To God be the glory!

1204
01:14:09.885 --> 01:14:11.613
You know what?
I'm leaving, that's it. Okay, I'm...


1205
01:14:11.637 --> 01:14:13.472
‪-No one is leaving anywhere!
‪-Eh?!


1206
01:14:14.806 --> 01:14:16.725
- If I slap you!
- Sub-Zero!


1207
01:14:17.643 --> 01:14:19.394
‪-Please, eh!
‪-Ah! Azeem! It's okay.


1208
01:14:19.478 --> 01:14:23.065
‪-Azeem! Stop!
‪-Give it to him! Hit him!


1209
01:14:23.148 --> 01:14:27.861
‪-Azeem!
‪-See blood!


1210
01:14:32.074 --> 01:14:35.952
So "Sub-Zero" and "Liu King,"
what caused the fight?


1211
01:14:38.038 --> 01:14:41.875
- Erm, I think it's time for us to leave.
- Eh, to where?


1212
01:14:41.958 --> 01:14:44.002
Nobody is going nowhere.

1213
01:14:44.086 --> 01:14:46.254
We know this fight is because of you.

1214
01:14:46.338 --> 01:14:48.215
What we wanna know is why?

1215
01:14:49.675 --> 01:14:51.051
She slept with Xavier.

1216
01:14:54.054 --> 01:14:55.054
You told her?

1217
01:14:55.138 --> 01:14:57.599
- What?!
- You just confirmed it, Azeem.


1218
01:14:58.642 --> 01:15:00.852
So I wasn't paranoid after all.

1219
01:15:02.396 --> 01:15:05.565
I knew something was going on
but I just couldn't place it.


1220
01:15:07.150 --> 01:15:11.113
What I don't understand right now
is why you, Donna? Tell me.


1221
01:15:12.072 --> 01:15:15.117
What kick do you derive

1222
01:15:16.618 --> 01:15:19.204
in sleeping with the man
that has had both of us?


1223
01:15:21.039 --> 01:15:23.500
- Boma.
- No, don't "Boma" me.


1224
01:15:24.751 --> 01:15:26.962
Do not even try
to "Boma" me at all.

1225
01:15:27.963 --> 01:15:32.050
You know very well
that Xavier was not over you.


1226
01:15:33.719 --> 01:15:38.390
But you had to come back
to remind him of what he was missing.


1227
01:15:39.599 --> 01:15:42.978
You have a great guy, my home boy Azeem.
You have a great man but no,


1228
01:15:43.729 --> 01:15:49.568
the "long-throat" in you had to come
for the one man that you introduced me to.


1229
01:15:49.651 --> 01:15:53.196
The one man
that you know I was in love with.


1230
01:15:54.239 --> 01:15:55.907
You stole him from me.

1231
01:15:55.991 --> 01:15:58.618
‪You know, I think
‪it's time that we cleared the air.


1232
01:15:59.870 --> 01:16:03.165
I have been keeping quiet
for you out of respect..


1233
01:16:04.207 --> 01:16:08.170
First of all,
I didn't steal nothing from you, Boma.


1234
01:16:08.253 --> 01:16:09.254
But you did!

1235
01:16:09.337 --> 01:16:12.299
‪Oh, when I talk you,
‪don't breath you stupid slut!


1236
01:16:12.382 --> 01:16:14.593
- Say it one more time.
- I said freaking slut.


1237
01:16:14.676 --> 01:16:16.195
- Shut your mouth!
- I said I'll beat this girl.


1238
01:16:16.219 --> 01:16:19.181
‪-No, I'll beat this girl. Ahn-ahn.
‪-Guys, please!


1239
01:16:19.264 --> 01:16:22.350
Secondly... you begged me

1240
01:16:22.434 --> 01:16:25.729
‪to introduce you
‪to Xavier because you liked him.


1241
01:16:26.938 --> 01:16:29.608
I cajoled him
into going on a date with you.


1242
01:16:30.442 --> 01:16:32.861
Yet you fabricated all sort of lies,

1243
01:16:32.944 --> 01:16:37.282
saying how great your relationship was
and how he loved you too well.


1244
01:16:37.866 --> 01:16:42.120
And every time Xavier talked
about you, it was the exact opposite.


1245
01:16:42.746 --> 01:16:43.746
Huh?

1246
01:16:43.872 --> 01:16:47.959
You told me how amazing
your sex life was. And the only time,


1247
01:16:48.043 --> 01:16:51.505
the one time you two got
down together, he was screaming my name.


1248
01:16:51.588 --> 01:16:53.608
- Eh, take your medal of achievement.
- Oh, take several seats, my darling.


1249
01:16:53.632 --> 01:16:55.926
Donna and I had sex
months after you and I did.


1250
01:16:56.009 --> 01:16:57.779
‪-Will you just shut up!
‪-Please, keep quiet.


1251
01:16:57.803 --> 01:16:59.137
I didn't ask you to step in.

1252
01:17:00.472 --> 01:17:02.658
You were not interested in Boma,
yet you didn't tell her.


1253
01:17:02.682 --> 01:17:03.682
- Hmm.
- Huh?


1254
01:17:04.100 --> 01:17:06.770
I even offered to tell her
on your behalf, you said no!


1255
01:17:07.395 --> 01:17:10.816
- Why didn't you tell her?
- Why would he? No, he can't!


1256
01:17:10.899 --> 01:17:15.320
Because this broke-ass motherfucker
was taking advantage of her generosity.


1257
01:17:15.904 --> 01:17:18.698
This same Boma here
paid for his studies in China.


1258
01:17:18.782 --> 01:17:20.422
We don't even know what he studied there.

1259
01:17:20.492 --> 01:17:22.285
The car you are driving, she bought it!

1260
01:17:22.369 --> 01:17:24.830
This same idiot is feeding on Boma

1261
01:17:24.913 --> 01:17:28.166
- every blessed day. He's so broke!
- I never asked her for anything!


1262
01:17:28.250 --> 01:17:31.336
Really? But you never refused either.

1263
01:17:32.170 --> 01:17:33.964
The only thing
you never ask me for was sex.


1264
01:17:34.047 --> 01:17:35.340
‪Oh, how generous.

1265
01:17:35.423 --> 01:17:37.259
No, no, listen guys. 
Please, listen.

1266
01:17:37.342 --> 01:17:39.262
‪I'm not on trial here.
‪I am not the guilty one.


1267
01:17:39.761 --> 01:17:41.513
Boma and I never defined what we had.

1268
01:17:42.347 --> 01:17:43.547
I never took advantage of you.

1269
01:17:43.598 --> 01:17:47.185
You in turn tried to buy me with
everything you did, so let us be clear.


1270
01:17:48.019 --> 01:17:51.106
Whatever you think we had,
was all in your head. Alright?


1271
01:17:52.148 --> 01:17:55.569
You painted me black in front of everybody
and I took it in good stride, so please.


1272
01:17:58.947 --> 01:17:59.948
What's funny?

1273
01:18:01.157 --> 01:18:04.619
Oh my goodness, this
guy is just a clown.

1274
01:18:04.703 --> 01:18:06.496
Guy, if I were you, 
I would shut up.

1275
01:18:06.580 --> 01:18:08.248
- No, you shut the fuck up.
- Excuse you?


1276
01:18:08.331 --> 01:18:10.101
- No, no, you shut up!
- Don't tell me to shut up!


1277
01:18:10.125 --> 01:18:12.836
You shut up!
How different are you from me?


1278
01:18:12.919 --> 01:18:15.755
We all know that your wealth
is daddy's money, so please.


1279
01:18:15.839 --> 01:18:17.900
- Hey, you guys, please just wait.
- It's like what I did to you


1280
01:18:17.924 --> 01:18:20.302
‪-is not enough? You want some more, right?
‪-That's okay!


1281
01:18:20.385 --> 01:18:22.929
That is okay!
Look, I'll pour pepper on you.


1282
01:18:23.013 --> 01:18:24.848
Look, let's drink!

1283
01:18:26.600 --> 01:18:28.440
- Don't mess with me, bastard!
- Shut up. Shut.


1284
01:18:32.230 --> 01:18:37.485
So guys, the room is about
to become lighter. Step one, done.


1285
01:18:38.820 --> 01:18:40.655
Step two...

1286
01:18:42.908 --> 01:18:44.451
Step two.

1287
01:18:45.285 --> 01:18:47.621
Are you actually blind or deaf?

1288
01:18:48.288 --> 01:18:51.041
- Alcohol and meds do not go together.
- Look, carry on.


1289
01:18:51.625 --> 01:18:52.876
- Fade.
- What?


1290
01:18:52.959 --> 01:18:55.837
‪So this small one ‪she wants to
drink now, it will kill her?


1291
01:18:57.297 --> 01:18:58.577
My dear, are you done with that?

1292
01:18:59.382 --> 01:19:01.426
Hmm. Good.

1293
01:19:02.218 --> 01:19:06.139
- Exactly what we needed.
- Boma, don't.


1294
01:19:08.558 --> 01:19:09.935
It's all in my head.

1295
01:19:13.521 --> 01:19:14.856
‪Oh, right.

1296
01:19:19.861 --> 01:19:20.861
Donna.

1297
01:19:24.407 --> 01:19:26.034
I slept with Azeem.

1298
01:19:27.369 --> 01:19:28.369
‪Oops.

1299
01:19:30.664 --> 01:19:31.706
‪What?

1300
01:19:32.916 --> 01:19:36.127
- Boma. Stop.
- What?!


1301
01:19:36.211 --> 01:19:38.004
- Stop.
- When?


1302
01:19:38.088 --> 01:19:40.423
Babe. Baby, baby...

1303
01:19:41.091 --> 01:19:46.179
Listen, just listen to me. It's not what
you think, okay? I can... Baby, please.


1304
01:19:46.262 --> 01:19:47.490
- Don't touch me.
- Wait please, I'm sorry.


1305
01:19:47.514 --> 01:19:50.225
‪-I can... Baby, just...
Please hear me out. ‪-You?


1306
01:19:50.308 --> 01:19:55.605
If... Boma, what are you...
I-... I... baby, just listen to me...


1307
01:19:55.689 --> 01:19:58.149
‪-Don't touch me!
‪-Baby, please just listen to me.


1308
01:19:58.233 --> 01:20:00.235
- You slept with Boma?
- Just listen to me.


1309
01:20:00.318 --> 01:20:01.379
‪You say she's your best friend,

1310
01:20:01.403 --> 01:20:02.320
‪-you slept with her?
‪-Just listen to me.


1311
01:20:02.404 --> 01:20:05.532
- You slept with your best friend?
- Baby, just please,


1312
01:20:05.615 --> 01:20:07.677
‪-listen to me, I'm begging you. I'm s...
‪-You slept with your...


1313
01:20:07.701 --> 01:20:08.827
Babe please just...

1314
01:20:08.910 --> 01:20:11.371
‪I'm sorry but I won't
‪let you go until you just at least...


1315
01:20:11.454 --> 01:20:13.474
- Hey! Leave her alone what's your problem?
- Leave me alone!


1316
01:20:13.498 --> 01:20:16.459
- The lady says you should leave her alone.
- Are you crazy?


1317
01:20:16.543 --> 01:20:18.586
- Are you crazy? What's your problem?
- Hey! Hey!


1318
01:20:18.670 --> 01:20:19.295
‪-Are you okay?
‪-Hey, you guys!


1319
01:20:19.379 --> 01:20:21.232
‪-What do you want to do to me?!
‪-That is okay!


1320
01:20:21.256 --> 01:20:22.483
- What do you want to do, move back!
- You want to hit me?


1321
01:20:22.507 --> 01:20:25.427
‪-Xavier! Azeem! I said...
‪-Yes, get out there! What d'you wanna do?


1322
01:20:25.510 --> 01:20:27.029
‪-What do you wanna do about it?
‪-Hey listen...


1323
01:20:27.053 --> 01:20:31.891
I said, "Stop fighting." Stop right there.

1324
01:20:31.975 --> 01:20:34.144
- Oh my goodness.
- Remember I told you guys


1325
01:20:34.227 --> 01:20:35.562
‪we have pepper in this house.

1326
01:20:35.645 --> 01:20:37.313
I will pour pepper on your faces!

1327
01:20:37.397 --> 01:20:39.524
And Mr. Xavier, what is your own problem?

1328
01:20:39.607 --> 01:20:42.777
Allow the couple settle
their differences. What's wrong with you?


1329
01:20:43.486 --> 01:20:44.863
- Fuck you!
- That's okay.


1330
01:20:48.283 --> 01:20:50.785
- Baby...
- Don't touch me!


1331
01:20:51.786 --> 01:20:53.621
- You slept with Boma?
- I... I...


1332
01:20:54.664 --> 01:20:56.544
‪-That's your best friend!
‪-Please just listen.


1333
01:20:56.750 --> 01:20:58.752
- You slept with her!
- Listen to me.


1334
01:20:58.835 --> 01:21:01.296
- Listen to what?!
- Baby, just listen, I know you're mad.


1335
01:21:01.379 --> 01:21:06.968
- Just listen to what I have to say.
- Boma, Boma.


1336
01:21:07.802 --> 01:21:12.974
But wait, this equation is not balanced.
No, this life is not balanced.


1337
01:21:13.058 --> 01:21:16.644
- What do you mean by life isn't balanced?
- Are you not seeing what I'm seeing?


1338
01:21:16.728 --> 01:21:21.858
In the spirit of sleeping with one another
look at how heated this conversation is.


1339
01:21:21.941 --> 01:21:25.070
It's now looking like it's only me
and Xavier that have not...


1340
01:21:25.153 --> 01:21:26.446
‪Do you get what I mean?

1341
01:21:26.529 --> 01:21:28.698
Hello Xavier, are you
in the mood for some sex, please?


1342
01:21:28.782 --> 01:21:29.782
‪Fade, shut up!

1343
01:21:30.492 --> 01:21:31.492
Shut up!

1344
01:21:32.494 --> 01:21:33.995
Shut your mouth!

1345
01:21:34.829 --> 01:21:38.625
I don't care about you but I'm worried
about the way you've been acting all day.


1346
01:21:39.542 --> 01:21:42.712
You are close to menopause
and you're acting like a child. Yes!


1347
01:21:43.880 --> 01:21:47.550
You better stop playing with sand
and freaking grow up because


1348
01:21:47.634 --> 01:21:50.345
all of this, all this is not funny!

1349
01:21:50.428 --> 01:21:51.447
- Ahn-ahn
- Before I get that


1350
01:21:51.471 --> 01:21:52.806
‪stupid wig off your head!

1351
01:21:52.889 --> 01:21:55.201
- Please, is this one normal?
- You are the one that is not normal!


1352
01:21:55.225 --> 01:21:56.368
‪-Is this one normal?
‪-You're the one.


1353
01:21:56.392 --> 01:21:58.728
- Is she normal at all?
- No wonder you guys are friends.


1354
01:21:58.812 --> 01:22:00.188
‪-She's right.
‪-Please, Fade.


1355
01:22:00.271 --> 01:22:03.233
- She's right. It's not funny.
- Oh my goodness.


1356
01:22:03.316 --> 01:22:05.652
You need to cut it out please.
It's not funny at all.


1357
01:22:05.735 --> 01:22:07.362
Coming from you?!

1358
01:22:09.322 --> 01:22:12.075
No! You need to freaking grow up!

1359
01:22:12.784 --> 01:22:13.784
Why are we here?

1360
01:22:14.577 --> 01:22:18.706
Our secrets would have been
safe with us, but you just had to do this!


1361
01:22:20.458 --> 01:22:22.001
- What are doing?
- Fade, stop.


1362
01:22:22.085 --> 01:22:25.380
- No Boma, what is this?
- Fade. Stop.


1363
01:22:25.463 --> 01:22:27.090
"Stopinatu" indeed! You and who?

1364
01:22:27.924 --> 01:22:31.845
Look at you?
What are you doing, for God's sake?!


1365
01:22:31.928 --> 01:22:33.346
You were over this guy.

1366
01:22:33.429 --> 01:22:37.517
The next moment you set your eyes
on this thing and you lost focus!


1367
01:22:37.600 --> 01:22:40.562
Take a look at the mirror,
Boma, you are a catch!


1368
01:22:40.645 --> 01:22:45.275
- You deserve better than this goat!
- Hey, hey, Fade. Watch it, Fade!


1369
01:22:45.358 --> 01:22:47.026
- Eh? Eh?
- Fade.


1370
01:22:47.110 --> 01:22:49.487
No, no. That means
you want to beat me.

1371
01:22:49.571 --> 01:22:52.240
Look, you are a goat
and she is a cow!

1372
01:22:52.907 --> 01:22:55.994
Because only a cow
that will lie that she has cancer,


1373
01:22:56.077 --> 01:22:59.289
just to get some
cheap attention from a goat like you.


1374
01:22:59.372 --> 01:23:00.474
- Hey, don't let me disrespect you!
- What?! Boma?


1375
01:23:00.498 --> 01:23:03.001
You didn't even say malaria.

1376
01:23:03.668 --> 01:23:07.463
Boma, you did not choose typhoid.
You went to carry it from top...


1377
01:23:07.547 --> 01:23:09.465
Cancer! Best dreaded disease.

1378
01:23:09.549 --> 01:23:12.093
Guys, she's drunk. She's drunk.

1379
01:23:12.177 --> 01:23:13.404
Fade, you are drunk and you need

1380
01:23:13.428 --> 01:23:14.220
‪-to sleep it off.
‪-Excuse me?


1381
01:23:14.304 --> 01:23:17.849
I can hold a glass. 
I am clear as day.

1382
01:23:17.932 --> 01:23:20.935
This guy here... this goat, I mean..

1383
01:23:21.769 --> 01:23:27.442
He doesn't deserve all this attention
and argument we've been on all day.


1384
01:23:27.525 --> 01:23:30.987
Look at me.
Desperation is good. Yes it is.


1385
01:23:31.070 --> 01:23:33.740
But you see
in this case... misplaced priority


1386
01:23:34.824 --> 01:23:35.992
Boma.

1387
01:23:37.202 --> 01:23:39.037
- What is wrong with her?
- Boma.


1388
01:23:40.121 --> 01:23:43.041
- Wait, is there garlic in the soup?
- I don't know, I think there was.


1389
01:23:43.124 --> 01:23:44.852
- I'm not sure.
- Oh my gosh. She's allergic to garlic!


1390
01:23:44.876 --> 01:23:46.878
‪I don't know but... Boma!

1391
01:23:46.961 --> 01:23:48.838
Boma. Boma!

1392
01:23:50.048 --> 01:23:51.841
Boma, Boma.

1393
01:23:52.675 --> 01:23:57.889
Jesus! Oh my God! Jesus.

1394
01:23:57.972 --> 01:24:01.184
‪Hey. Jesus, Jesus.

1395
01:24:01.267 --> 01:24:05.480
- Oh my God, oh my God!
- Boma...


1396
01:24:05.563 --> 01:24:07.982
‪-Why are you still there?
‪-Please have some water.


1397
01:24:11.611 --> 01:24:12.779
<i>I mean...</i>

1398
01:24:12.862 --> 01:24:13.655
Okay, bye-bye.

1399
01:24:13.738 --> 01:24:15.418
- <i>It wasn't like I planned to.</i>
- Thank you.


1400
01:24:15.448 --> 01:24:17.242
<i>It just happened, out of nowhere.</i>

1401
01:24:18.034 --> 01:24:20.245
<i>I looked like a mess.</i>

1402
01:24:20.328 --> 01:24:22.538
<i>And I couldn't
let him see me like that.</i>


1403
01:24:23.289 --> 01:24:25.625
<i>‪I wasn't going to
‪be the ex that let herself go.</i>


1404
01:24:25.708 --> 01:24:27.710
<i>So I tried to hide.</i>

1405
01:24:27.794 --> 01:24:30.255
Boma? Boma?

1406
01:24:31.339 --> 01:24:33.925
I knew it was you! 
How are you doing?

1407
01:24:34.592 --> 01:24:39.847
- Hi. Xavier. How are you doing?
- Hey. So good to see you.


1408
01:24:39.931 --> 01:24:40.931
<i>And as we spoke,</i>

1409
01:24:40.974 --> 01:24:44.769
<i>I realised he was in a much better space
than the last time we saw.</i>


1410
01:24:44.852 --> 01:24:48.106
I wasn't too sure
but I just, you know...

1411
01:24:48.189 --> 01:24:51.818
I actually came to get stuff and I forgot
something so that's why I quickly...


1412
01:24:51.901 --> 01:24:53.581
- turned, cause I remembered...
- Oh, yeah.


1413
01:24:54.654 --> 01:24:55.363
Okay, but are you sure you're okay?

1414
01:24:55.446 --> 01:25:00.952
- Are you sure you are...
- Erm... I'm strong in Jesus' name.


1415
01:25:02.203 --> 01:25:03.913
I'm strong.

1416
01:25:03.997 --> 01:25:06.124
<i>I was happy for him genuinely,</i>

1417
01:25:06.874 --> 01:25:09.460
<i>But a part of me
felt like I'd missed out.</i>

1418
01:25:10.420 --> 01:25:14.007
<i>Either way, I honestly assumed
that day would be the last I'd see of him.</i>


1419
01:25:14.799 --> 01:25:18.219
<i>And I was actually
okay with it, then this happened:</i>


1420
01:25:20.805 --> 01:25:21.889
<i>I couldn't believe it.</i>

1421
01:25:22.682 --> 01:25:24.183
<i>It was you.</i>

1422
01:25:25.601 --> 01:25:26.601
Hello?

1423
01:25:27.061 --> 01:25:28.061
Who is this, please?

1424
01:25:28.896 --> 01:25:30.606
<i>Hi, Boma, it's Xavier.</i>

1425
01:25:31.983 --> 01:25:36.654
Oh... hey, Xavier. Erm, I'm sorry.

1426
01:25:37.322 --> 01:25:40.450
<i>It's cool. I would delete
my number too if I were you.</i>


1427
01:25:41.451 --> 01:25:42.952
<i>Okay so...</i>

1428
01:25:43.578 --> 01:25:46.664
<i>I know this is a random question,
but how are you doing, really?</i>


1429
01:25:46.748 --> 01:25:47.915
Erm...

1430
01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:52.003
I'm fine, I guess. Why?

1431
01:25:52.962 --> 01:25:54.005
<i>So you're fine?</i>

1432
01:25:54.839 --> 01:25:56.090
Mm-hmm, I am.

1433
01:25:57.717 --> 01:25:58.634
<i>Okay great, because I...</i>

1434
01:25:58.718 --> 01:26:02.555
<i>Turns out he had been thinking about
the day he ran into me at the supermarket</i>


1435
01:26:02.638 --> 01:26:04.307
<i>and was worried about how I looked.</i>

1436
01:26:04.974 --> 01:26:07.852
<i>I assumed this was him
actually caring about me.</i>


1437
01:26:09.854 --> 01:26:10.897
<i>Boma?</i>

1438
01:26:10.980 --> 01:26:12.207
<i>And that was when it came to me.</i>

1439
01:26:12.231 --> 01:26:15.860
<i>- Boma, are you crying?</i>
- You know what?


1440
01:26:17.612 --> 01:26:23.409
I just... you know what? I just can't.

1441
01:26:24.202 --> 01:26:26.746
- I can't take it any more.
<i>- It's fine, it's fine,</i>


1442
01:26:26.829 --> 01:26:28.831
<i>‪Boma, just calm down. 
Breath in, out.</i>

1443
01:26:34.462 --> 01:26:37.131
<i>- You know what? I'm coming over.</i>
- No. You really don't have to.


1444
01:26:37.799 --> 01:26:39.050
<i>I want to.</i>

1445
01:26:39.801 --> 01:26:43.930
‪No. Okay, if you insist.

1446
01:26:47.558 --> 01:26:51.062
I'll be home. I'll be home soon.

1447
01:26:52.063 --> 01:26:53.314
Alright, bye.

1448
01:27:15.545 --> 01:27:18.965
‪What will I do?

1449
01:27:36.315 --> 01:27:38.651
I don't even know what to do.

1450
01:27:54.333 --> 01:27:56.043
‪I don't even...

1451
01:27:57.295 --> 01:28:00.423
I'm supposed to be an
actress not a consultant.


1452
01:28:11.809 --> 01:28:14.729
Erm, Xavier...

1453
01:28:15.229 --> 01:28:18.107
- I didn't even know I left my door open.
- Yeah.


1454
01:28:19.942 --> 01:28:21.110
I brought comfort food.

1455
01:28:24.155 --> 01:28:25.323
You know...

1456
01:28:26.282 --> 01:28:30.119
- You didn't have to.
- I know, but I wanted to.


1457
01:28:33.164 --> 01:28:34.624
Look Boma, I...

1458
01:28:35.500 --> 01:28:38.461
I know I hurt you
so much in the past.

1459
01:28:39.754 --> 01:28:43.174
I'm really sorry for what
I put you through and how I made you feel.


1460
01:28:45.134 --> 01:28:48.304
And I want to believe
that we've put that behind us.


1461
01:28:49.931 --> 01:28:53.267
So please, tell me
what exactly is going on.


1462
01:28:54.477 --> 01:28:56.187
<i>And that's exactly what I did.</i>

1463
01:29:00.983 --> 01:29:07.114
- They said it might be cancer.
- Boma?


1464
01:29:08.741 --> 01:29:09.741
‪Cancer?

1465
01:29:11.118 --> 01:29:12.370
I don't know what to do.

1466
01:29:14.038 --> 01:29:15.998
This thing is eating me deep inside me.

1467
01:29:17.333 --> 01:29:23.297
I don't have anyone to call my own.
I don't know what to do.


1468
01:29:23.881 --> 01:29:27.343
‪Oh Xavier, I don't know what to do.
‪There's nobody I can call my own.


1469
01:29:28.135 --> 01:29:31.847
It's alright. I'm here, it's okay.
Hey, it's okay.


1470
01:29:33.516 --> 01:29:34.516
Coming.

1471
01:29:39.897 --> 01:29:42.692
<i>I'm just wondering
if this is how it'll end for me.</i>


1472
01:29:42.775 --> 01:29:43.775
<i>‪Hey, hey, hey.</i>

1473
01:29:44.318 --> 01:29:46.237
<i>Don't talk like that.</i>

1474
01:29:46.904 --> 01:29:47.905
But it's the truth.

1475
01:29:50.241 --> 01:29:55.162
I never got married.
I don't have any children.


1476
01:29:56.080 --> 01:29:58.374
<i>Well, the only thing
going for me is my business.</i>


1477
01:29:59.625 --> 01:30:04.797
<i>And the one good relationship
I had turned out to be...</i>


1478
01:30:06.465 --> 01:30:09.260
For the record, 
I'm sorry for everything.

1479
01:30:10.219 --> 01:30:12.513
If I could take it
all back, you know I will.


1480
01:30:17.018 --> 01:30:18.602
Please don't tell anyone.

1481
01:30:20.271 --> 01:30:21.314
I...

1482
01:30:22.815 --> 01:30:24.608
I'm not ready to share it yet.

1483
01:30:25.401 --> 01:30:29.030
And I'm also just coming
to terms with all of this.


1484
01:30:29.113 --> 01:30:31.782
I don't want anyone
putting pressure on me.


1485
01:30:31.866 --> 01:30:32.992
‪lt's okay, it's okay.

1486
01:30:33.909 --> 01:30:36.537
I completely understand.
Whenever you're ready.


1487
01:30:36.620 --> 01:30:39.540
But you went ahead and did it anyway.

1488
01:30:39.623 --> 01:30:42.126
Even after I had told you
not to tell anyone.


1489
01:30:43.836 --> 01:30:46.589
You went to tell her because
you knew she was going to come rushing.


1490
01:30:48.382 --> 01:30:50.134
So contrary to what you all believe,

1491
01:30:50.217 --> 01:30:52.762
he came here to see you, not me.

1492
01:30:53.387 --> 01:30:55.014
Am I right or am I right?

1493
01:30:55.097 --> 01:30:58.392
‪That still does not justify
‪you lying about cancer.


1494
01:30:59.185 --> 01:31:02.146
That is very serious.
It is cancer we are talking about here.


1495
01:31:03.606 --> 01:31:05.524
You know, if Fade
had done something like this,


1496
01:31:05.608 --> 01:31:07.735
‪I probably won't be surprised.

1497
01:31:07.818 --> 01:31:11.614
But coming from you,
pretending to have cancer...


1498
01:31:12.239 --> 01:31:16.744
- Really? How desperate can you be?
- Is this guy okay?


1499
01:31:16.827 --> 01:31:19.080
- Please.
- Do you know how worried I was?


1500
01:31:20.581 --> 01:31:23.084
Well, excuse me if me lying about cancer

1501
01:31:23.167 --> 01:31:25.961
is going to make you remember
someone you once called friend,


1502
01:31:26.045 --> 01:31:27.045
so be it.

1503
01:31:28.422 --> 01:31:34.053
After you knowingly lied
and you didn't even think to apologise...


1504
01:31:34.136 --> 01:31:35.513
Why?

1505
01:31:35.596 --> 01:31:39.308
Because you are the almighty Donna Jabal.

1506
01:31:39.392 --> 01:31:41.102
That is not true and you know that.

1507
01:31:42.561 --> 01:31:44.146
Boma, so you deceived me.

1508
01:31:47.650 --> 01:31:50.778
It hurts to be on
the other side of the fence, right?


1509
01:31:50.861 --> 01:31:55.074
No Boma, this is not a joking matter.
Like, what are you laughing about?


1510
01:31:55.157 --> 01:31:57.410
Is this something
we should give you an award for? Lying?


1511
01:31:58.119 --> 01:32:02.289
Lying that you have cancer?
Come on, man. Stop it.


1512
01:32:02.373 --> 01:32:03.373
Stop it!

1513
01:32:03.707 --> 01:32:06.001
- You need help!
- Azeem?


1514
01:32:06.710 --> 01:32:08.337
- I need help!
- Yes!


1515
01:32:08.421 --> 01:32:10.172
Azeem, from you, I need help?

1516
01:32:10.256 --> 01:32:16.095
Coming from someone who cheats,
who bribes and who hits his wife?


1517
01:32:16.178 --> 01:32:21.142
Azeem, I beg you, sorry,
just remove the log in your eye,


1518
01:32:21.225 --> 01:32:22.143
Before you come for me...

1519
01:32:22.226 --> 01:32:25.312
- You lied. That's the point.
- Why did you lie?


1520
01:32:25.396 --> 01:32:27.958
- She's sitting there trying to justify it.
- And you are sitting down there...


1521
01:32:27.982 --> 01:32:30.502
‪-What about all the other lies you told?
‪-I was still with my husband.


1522
01:32:30.526 --> 01:32:31.735
‪You play ball up and down...

1523
01:32:31.819 --> 01:32:33.088
‪-Yet you lied...
‪-You slept with my husband...


1524
01:32:33.112 --> 01:32:35.781
Shut up! Shut up!

1525
01:32:37.158 --> 01:32:38.158
What's that?

1526
01:32:38.617 --> 01:32:40.494
- What?
- Can't you hear?


1527
01:32:41.162 --> 01:32:43.914
Boma has cancer!

1528
01:32:46.000 --> 01:32:47.126
Ahn-ahn.

1529
01:32:48.002 --> 01:32:49.336
Are they fighting outside?

1530
01:32:50.296 --> 01:32:52.882
- Hey, Boma!
- Who would be fighting here?


1531
01:32:52.965 --> 01:32:55.092
‪What kind of problem
‪is this? What's going on?


1532
01:32:55.759 --> 01:33:01.140
Ah, Fade! Boma.

1533
01:33:02.183 --> 01:33:05.311
Boma has cancer!

1534
01:33:06.896 --> 01:33:08.522
- No, come on.
- What is it?


1535
01:33:09.315 --> 01:33:13.986
What sort of trouble is this? See... God.

1536
01:33:14.069 --> 01:33:15.946
- Are those...?
- My family.


1537
01:33:16.030 --> 01:33:18.449
Ahn-ahn.. Who called them?

1538
01:33:18.532 --> 01:33:21.952
- I don't know. I didn't call them.
- I did.


1539
01:33:23.787 --> 01:33:26.624
- Donna, Donna.
- Hello? Lara?


1540
01:33:27.291 --> 01:33:32.755
Ah! Mom!

1541
01:33:32.838 --> 01:33:38.886
- Why are you shouting? What happened?
- Oh God!


1542
01:33:39.386 --> 01:33:45.392
- Oh God!
- What happened? What happened?


1543
01:33:46.435 --> 01:33:50.105
- Cancer!
- For who?


1544
01:33:50.856 --> 01:33:55.653
- Boma.
- My Boma has cancer?


1545
01:33:55.736 --> 01:34:00.824
- Yes. She will die soon.
- My Boma has cancer?


1546
01:34:00.908 --> 01:34:06.121
She has cancer. lye? lye? lye!

1547
01:34:06.205 --> 01:34:09.875
- I only called Lara and I guess...
- It spread.


1548
01:34:09.959 --> 01:34:13.254
Yes. And in my defense,
I didn't know it was a lie.


1549
01:34:13.337 --> 01:34:16.966
Who sent you?
Who sent you, Madam Know-It-All?


1550
01:34:17.049 --> 01:34:18.968
- Why did you go and call?
- Why did you lie?


1551
01:34:19.051 --> 01:34:21.029
- Do not talk to my wife like that.
- Why did you lie?


1552
01:34:21.053 --> 01:34:23.365
‪-Boma, do not speak to my wife like that.
‪-Why did you lie?


1553
01:34:23.389 --> 01:34:25.057
‪-Madam Therapy.
‪-It's okay now.


1554
01:34:25.140 --> 01:34:26.368
‪-It's a liar.
‪-Do you want to handle them?


1555
01:34:26.392 --> 01:34:27.476
‪Because you are a liar.

1556
01:34:27.560 --> 01:34:29.579
‪Because none of this
‪would have happen, Madam Abibi.


1557
01:34:29.603 --> 01:34:31.831
‪Mr. I'm-In-Love-With-You,
‪what kind of rubbish is this?


1558
01:34:31.855 --> 01:34:34.400
- Ladies and gentlemen!
- What kind of rubbish is that?!


1559
01:34:34.483 --> 01:34:36.527
We're going to tell them the truth.

1560
01:34:36.610 --> 01:34:38.445
- Eh?
- What truth?


1561
01:34:38.529 --> 01:34:40.906
At least what they think is the truth.

1562
01:34:40.990 --> 01:34:41.991
Which is?

1563
01:34:42.074 --> 01:34:46.078
We started with a lie, isn't it? So we
can as well just finish it with the lie.


1564
01:34:46.161 --> 01:34:47.037
- Yes!
- Look..


1565
01:34:47.121 --> 01:34:49.521
‪-I don't think that is a good idea.
‪-It doesn't make sense.


1566
01:34:49.582 --> 01:34:51.262
What you are saying doesn't make any sense

1567
01:34:52.293 --> 01:34:54.044
My friend come back.

1568
01:34:54.128 --> 01:34:55.689
‪-What kind of nons... What are you doing?
‪-Ahn-ahn!


1569
01:34:55.713 --> 01:34:57.423
We'll tell them the truth now!

1570
01:35:00.634 --> 01:35:02.261
‪Fade. Fade.

1571
01:35:02.344 --> 01:35:03.220
- Fade
- Fade, mind yourself.


1572
01:35:03.304 --> 01:35:05.240
‪Fade what type of rubbish
‪is this one you are doing?


1573
01:35:05.264 --> 01:35:06.765
Azeem, stand up. Go and...

1574
01:35:06.849 --> 01:35:07.766
‪-What are you doing? You're looking at me.
‪-What do you want me to do?


1575
01:35:07.850 --> 01:35:09.059
Hold her how, why can't you

1576
01:35:09.143 --> 01:35:10.060
‪Why can't you go and hold her?

1577
01:35:10.144 --> 01:35:11.246
- Why would I hold her?
- Please leave me alone.


1578
01:35:11.270 --> 01:35:16.442
Boma is dead!

1579
01:35:17.359 --> 01:35:21.488
‪-Oh, Mum!
‪-Where's my child?


1580
01:35:22.114 --> 01:35:24.134
- You better go and deal with your mess.
- Wait, let us all cry.


1581
01:35:24.158 --> 01:35:25.427
‪-How can I go and
‪-Let us all cry.


1582
01:35:25.451 --> 01:35:27.178
‪-She's about to die. She has cancer.
‪-No idea what you are talking about.


1583
01:35:27.202 --> 01:35:28.221
‪-She's about to die.
‪-I don't even know why you are here.


1584
01:35:28.245 --> 01:35:30.080
You are the one that will die, Donna.

1585
01:35:30.164 --> 01:35:32.017
- But you're...
- You are the one whose death is coming.


1586
01:35:32.041 --> 01:35:34.269
‪-You're the one that has cancer.
‪-It is death that is coming for you.


1587
01:35:34.293 --> 01:35:35.854
- It's not coming for me.
- And it's not everyone that has cancer


1588
01:35:35.878 --> 01:35:37.087
‪that dies, but you will die.

1589
01:35:37.171 --> 01:35:42.343
- Ah, God! Boma is a good girl.
- Mum.


1590
01:35:42.426 --> 01:35:44.678
‪Boma is a fine girl!

1591
01:35:44.762 --> 01:35:47.681
‪Boma is a perfect example of a child!

1592
01:35:48.223 --> 01:35:49.743
