00:16:12.580 --> 00:16:14.910
<i>No, Seiya. Don't!</i>

00:16:17.620 --> 00:16:19.580
<i>Led me right to your doorstep.</i>
<i>指引我到了你家门口</i>


140
00:16:19.870 --> 00:16:22.700
检测到能量资源
目标


141
00:16:24.340 --> 00:16:26.470
Saved me so much trouble.

142
00:16:30.430 --> 00:16:31.260
Let's go!
我们走吧

00:16:31.850 --> 00:16:32.680
Let's go!

144
00:16:32.760 --> 00:16:35.270
You can't use it. Only the Pegasus can!
你用不了的 只有天马座才可以


145
00:16:35.350 --> 00:16:36.980
That's why you're coming with us.
这就是为什么你要跟我们走


146
00:17:02.710 --> 00:17:03.750
Relax.
放松


147
00:17:05.050 --> 00:17:06.460
Relax, we're safe now.
放松, 我们现在安全了


148
00:17:07.420 --> 00:17:08.450
Safe?
安全？


149
00:17:08.550 --> 00:17:10.300
First I get attacked by ninja cyborgs,
我先被忍者机器人袭击


150
00:17:10.350 --> 00:17:12.020
then I got a spaceship shooting at me.

151
00:17:12.180 --> 00:17:14.350
And then that freak in a suit drugs me!
再然后那个穿西装的怪胎给我下了药


152
00:17:14.670 --> 00:17:16.970
Allow me to rephrase it.
请允许我换一种说法


153
00:17:17.060 --> 00:17:19.100
You're safer here than with Guraad.
你在这里会比跟着古拉杜更安全


154
00:17:19.250 --> 00:17:21.730
She has already captured many kids like you,
她已经抓走了很多像你一样的孩子


155
00:17:21.810 --> 00:17:23.070
drained them of their Cosmo.
吸干了他们的小宇宙


156
00:17:23.110 --> 00:17:25.410
Stop talking nonsense and tell me what's going on!
别再胡说八道了, 告诉我到底怎么回事！


157
00:17:26.070 --> 00:17:27.650
- Prepare for landing. - What?
- 准备着陆 - 什么？


158
00:17:27.740 --> 00:17:30.030
You might want to buckle up.

159
00:17:30.110 --> 00:17:31.280
No, I want answers now!
不, 我现在就要答案！


160
00:17:32.070 --> 00:17:33.160
Oh, shit.
哦, 该死


161
00:17:40.120 --> 00:17:41.380
There's no runway!
没跑道啊


162
00:17:44.630 --> 00:17:46.210
I said, you might want to buckle up.
我说过, 你最好系上安全带


163
00:17:56.720 --> 00:17:59.230
You couldn't just tell me this thing lands vertically?
你就不能告诉我这东西是垂直降落的吗？


164
00:18:06.150 --> 00:18:07.990
Let's start afresh, shall we?
让我们重新开始, 好吗？


165
00:18:08.610 --> 00:18:10.530
My name is Alman Kido.
我叫城户光政


166
00:18:10.610 --> 00:18:13.320
Once upon a time, I was a businessman.
从前, 我是一个商人


167
00:18:13.400 --> 00:18:15.860
Mylock, let her know our guest has arrived, please.
晨己, 请告诉她我们的客人到了


168
00:18:15.950 --> 00:18:17.120
Yes, sir.
是的, 先生


169
00:18:17.620 --> 00:18:19.620
Should I believe you went bust?
我应该相信你破产了吗？


170
00:18:19.750 --> 00:18:24.090
I won't hide the fact I've been quite successful in my trade.
不瞒你说, 我的生意做得相当成功


171
00:18:24.370 --> 00:18:27.160
But the one thing money can't buy is purpose.
但有一样东西是金钱买不到的, 那就是使命


172
00:18:27.500 --> 00:18:30.000
So this is where you store your "purpose"?
这就是你存放"使命"的地方？


173
00:18:30.550 --> 00:18:31.550
Yes.
是的


174
00:18:34.950 --> 00:18:36.750
Tell me, Seiya, what do you see?
告诉我, 星矢, 你看到了什么？


175
00:18:40.200 --> 00:18:41.360
I'm not sure.
我不确定


176
00:18:41.950 --> 00:18:44.460
A whole bunch of real old stuff, I guess.
一大堆真正的古董 我猜


177
00:18:45.520 --> 00:18:47.150
I see stories.
我看到的是故事


178
00:18:47.390 --> 00:18:51.880
Ancient heroes were defined by their monumental deeds
古代英雄是由他们的不朽事迹


179
00:18:51.900 --> 00:18:53.950
as much as by their tragic ends.
和他们的悲剧结局所定义的


180
00:18:54.990 --> 00:18:59.540
I always admired the formidable magnitude of their fate.
我一直钦佩他们命运的伟大


181
00:18:59.910 --> 00:19:05.290
I envied it. I used to think the ancient lore held no secret for me.
我很羡慕 我曾经以为古老的传说对我来说没有什么秘密


182
00:19:07.090 --> 00:19:08.860
I'm afraid that was my hubris.
恐怕是我太傲慢了


183
00:19:10.550 --> 00:19:12.420
What do you know about Athena?
你对雅典娜了解多少？


184
00:19:12.510 --> 00:19:15.380
- She was a god of war. - And wisdom.
- 她是战争之神 - 也是智慧之神


185
00:19:15.550 --> 00:19:18.640
What if I told you Athena had returned in human form
如果我告诉你 雅典娜重回人间了


186
00:19:18.810 --> 00:19:22.980
and you are destined to become one of her guardian knights?
而你注定要成为她的守护圣斗士之一呢？


187
00:19:23.420 --> 00:19:25.790
I'd say your therapist isn't worth his paycheck.
我得说, 你的心理医生配不上你付他的薪水


188
00:19:26.940 --> 00:19:29.090
Things happen for a reason, Seiya.
事出必有因, 星矢


189
00:19:29.380 --> 00:19:31.090
Your Cosmo brought you here.
是你的小宇宙把你带到这里来的


190
00:19:31.140 --> 00:19:33.810
Actually, I was brought here on a very expensive aircraft.
事实上, 我是乘坐一架非常昂贵的飞机来的


191
00:19:34.450 --> 00:19:36.450
And now I'm leaving on my own two feet.
现在, 我要靠自己的双脚离开了


192
00:19:38.700 --> 00:19:40.660
You know the truth in your heart, Seiya.
你心底知道真相, 星矢


193
00:19:41.120 --> 00:19:42.620
Your sister knew it too.
你姐姐也知道


194
00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:52.760
What do you know about my sister?
你对我姐姐了解多少？


195
00:19:52.850 --> 00:19:56.850
Ten years ago, 
Guraad detected a strong Cosmo

196
00:19:56.930 --> 00:19:59.050
at your location. She thought it was Patricia.
在你家那里 她以为是星华


197
00:19:59.080 --> 00:20:00.410
What did she do to her?
她对她做了什么？


198
00:20:00.520 --> 00:20:03.750
I don't know, but your sister gave herself up
我不知道, 但你姐姐拿自己顶上了


199
00:20:03.850 --> 00:20:05.880
so that Guraad wouldn't find you.
这样古拉杜就不会去找你


200
00:20:06.220 --> 00:20:08.810
She knew what you were to become.
她知道你的天命所归


201
00:20:08.900 --> 00:20:11.730
A warrior of Athena. The Pegasus Knight.
雅典娜的战士 天马座圣斗士


202
00:20:12.350 --> 00:20:13.630
The Pegasus Knight?
天马座圣斗士？


203
00:20:14.290 --> 00:20:15.880
You're really out of your mind.
你真是疯了


204
00:20:17.200 --> 00:20:18.950
That doesn't bode well.
这可不是什么好兆头


205
00:20:19.290 --> 00:20:20.540
This is Sienna.
这是沙织


206
00:20:21.740 --> 00:20:24.000
Guraad is after her too.
古拉杜也在追杀她


207
00:20:24.090 --> 00:20:25.670
Your mission is to protect her.
你的任务是保护她


208
00:20:25.790 --> 00:20:27.170
I can take care of myself.
我能照顾好自己


209
00:20:27.200 --> 00:20:29.870
Why would I ever want to risk my neck to protect some rich girl?
我为什么要冒着生命危险去保护一个富家千金？


210
00:20:31.290 --> 00:20:35.230
Because our little Sienna here is the reincarnation of the goddess Athena.
因为我们的小沙织就是雅典娜女神转世


211
00:20:35.260 --> 00:20:38.300
- Dad. - Don't you have something for our guest?
- 爸爸 - 你不是有东西要给我们的客人吗？


212
00:20:38.460 --> 00:20:40.880
Sure, a toilet, so he can flush himself out.
当然, 给个厕所, 这样他就能把自己冲走了


213
00:20:41.090 --> 00:20:43.380
Wow, spoken like a true goddess.
哇, 说得像个真正的女神


214
00:20:43.570 --> 00:20:47.530
Dad, come on. This moron can't seriously be the Pegasus Knight.
爸爸, 别这样，这个白痴不可能真的是天马座圣斗士


215
00:20:48.940 --> 00:20:49.940
Go on.
去吧


216
00:20:53.580 --> 00:20:54.700
Fine.
很好


217
00:20:55.040 --> 00:20:57.250
You might recognize this, Seiya.
你可能认得这个, 星矢


218
00:21:11.420 --> 00:21:12.500
This is Patricia's.
这是星华的


219
00:21:13.420 --> 00:21:16.090
That is the key to the Pegasus armor.
这就是天马圣衣的钥匙


220
00:21:16.170 --> 00:21:18.920
Without it, you don't stand a chance against Guraad's army.
没有圣衣, 想要对抗古拉杜的大军, 你根本没有机会


221
00:21:19.080 --> 00:21:20.360
I could've handled those guys.
我可以对付那些家伙


222
00:21:20.680 --> 00:21:22.180
That's not what Mylock said.
晨己可不是这么说的


223
00:21:25.620 --> 00:21:28.140
So how's this supposed to help me find my sister?
这个要怎么才能帮我找到我姐姐？


224
00:21:28.230 --> 00:21:30.690
You give me a little present and expect me to help you out?
给我一个小礼物, 就指望我会帮你？


225
00:21:30.730 --> 00:21:32.730
My plan is to trust you to do what is right.
我的计划是相信你会做正确的事


226
00:21:32.770 --> 00:21:33.980
And what would that be?
那是什么呢？


227
00:21:34.150 --> 00:21:37.440
I suppose you've never heard of Marin, the Silver Knight.
我想你从未听说过白银圣斗士魔铃吧


228
00:21:37.520 --> 00:21:39.270
God, another one of your old legends?
天哪, 又一个你的古老传说？


229
00:21:39.360 --> 00:21:41.660
Marin can teach you how to reveal
魔铃可以教你如何揭示


230
00:21:41.740 --> 00:21:43.470
the hidden secret of the pendant.
那个吊坠的秘密


231
00:21:43.670 --> 00:21:46.460
So you can protect Sienna, and yourself, against your enemies.
这样你就能保护沙织, 和你自己, 对抗敌人


232
00:21:46.640 --> 00:21:48.540
And maybe even help you find your sister.
也许还能帮你找到你姐姐


233
00:21:48.600 --> 00:21:50.260
Ancient gods. Magic knights.
古代诸神 魔法斗士


234
00:21:50.330 --> 00:21:52.830
Do you have any idea how totally insane you sound?
你知道你听起来有多疯狂吗？


235
00:21:52.960 --> 00:21:56.510
I know, it is a lot to take in, isn't it?
我知道, 这很难接受, 不是吗？


236
00:21:56.590 --> 00:22:00.430
So why don't we have breakfast, take the day off and...
那么, 我们为什么不吃点早餐, 休息一天, 然后...


237
00:22:01.440 --> 00:22:03.610
revisit this tomorrow. Yeah.
明天再看 嗯


238

Well, I am hungry, but...
我饿了, 但是...


239
00:22:08.850 --> 00:22:11.110
A goddess's fate is on the line, but sure.
女神的命运岌岌可危, 但是好吧


240
00:22:11.150 --> 00:22:12.960
Let's eat pancakes.
我们去吃煎饼吧


241
00:22:14.510 --> 00:22:15.350
Yeah.
对


242
00:22:25.990 --> 00:22:27.910
Get off my ring, you scum.
从我的擂台上滚开, 你这个人渣


243
00:22:28.750 --> 00:22:29.960
Get out of my ring!
滚出我的擂台


244
00:22:31.370 --> 00:22:32.960
You moron.
你个白痴


245
00:22:33.040 --> 00:22:35.070
You were supposed to keep a low profile.
你应该保持低调


246
00:22:35.710 --> 00:22:36.920
And I did.
我做到了


247
00:22:37.170 --> 00:22:39.210
We need to shut this place down.
我们得把这地方关掉


248
00:22:39.300 --> 00:22:42.720
- You don't get to decide that! - That's right. I do.
- 这不是你能决定的 - 没错 我可以


249
00:22:42.790 --> 00:22:44.380
Guraad, come on.
古拉杜, 别


250
00:22:45.140 --> 00:22:46.600
We have a great partnership.
我们合作得很好


251
00:22:46.730 --> 00:22:48.560
Yes. We did.
是的 是的


252
00:22:49.640 --> 00:22:51.560
How's the boy's Cosmo?
那小子的小宇宙怎么样？


253
00:22:51.640 --> 00:22:52.980
It's legit.

All the better.
那就更好了


257
00:22:59.860 --> 00:23:02.850
Nobody needs a loser who gets his ass kicked by a scrawny little kid.
没有人会需要一个 被一个小毛孩子打得屁滚尿流的失败者


258
00:23:02.930 --> 00:23:04.590
He got a lucky break.
他很走运


259
00:23:04.820 --> 00:23:06.980
No man gets lucky twice with Cassios.

260
00:23:07.070 --> 00:23:09.570
I can beat anyone, anytime.

261

Well, let's see if that's true.

Something wrong?
有什么问题吗？

I just don't know how you can breathe while you're eating like that.
我真不知道就你那种吃法怎么还能呼吸的

在我们那里, 有东西吃的时候, 能吃多少就吃多少

271
00:24:13.730 --> 00:24:15.060
Please excuse me.
请原谅


272
00:24:25.430 --> 00:24:26.430
So...
所以...


273
00:24:28.010 --> 00:24:29.840
How does it feel to be a goddess?
成为女神的感觉如何？


274
00:24:32.450 --> 00:24:35.620
Well, I'm not a goddess yet.
好吧, 我还不是女神


275
00:24:36.890 --> 00:24:38.060
Just Sienna.
只是沙织


276
00:24:38.080 --> 00:24:40.880
But her Cosmo is getting stronger by the day,
但她的小宇宙一天比一天强大


277
00:24:40.960 --> 00:24:43.550
and someday soon I will become Athena.
不久之后, 我将成为雅典娜


278
00:24:48.510 --> 00:24:50.680
Most people would be excited

279
00:24:51.440 --> 00:24:53.460
to have breakfast with a future goddess.
与未来的女神共进早餐


280
00:24:56.420 --> 00:24:57.840
Guess I'm not most people, then.
看来我不是大多数人


281
00:24:59.480 --> 00:25:01.230
Well, then maybe you should...
那么, 也许你应该...


282
00:25:04.900 --> 00:25:06.320
Maybe I should what?
也许我应该什么？


283
00:25:13.790 --> 00:25:15.080
You should back off.
你应该退后


284
00:25:15.790 --> 00:25:17.080
Jeez, don't be so sensitive.
哎呀, 别这么敏感嘛


285
00:25:19.250 --> 00:25:20.540
Just get away from me, okay?
离我远点, 好吗？


286
00:25:20.630 --> 00:25:22.170
- Okay, I'm sorry. - Just get away...
- 好吧, 对不起 - 走开...


287
00:25:30.890 --> 00:25:31.720
Hey!
嘿！


288
00:25:33.760 --> 00:25:35.220
Dad!
爸爸


289
00:25:35.770 --> 00:25:36.640
Hey!
嘿！


290
00:25:37.270 --> 00:25:39.230
- Are you okay? - Wait!
- 你还好吗？ - 等等


291
00:25:43.070 --> 00:25:44.440
What's going on?
怎么了？


292
00:25:45.110 --> 00:25:46.820
She could kill you right now.
她现在就能杀了你


293
00:25:47.320 --> 00:25:49.490
I'm here, sweetheart, just relax.
我在这里, 亲爱的, 放轻松


294
00:25:57.790 --> 00:25:58.910
What just happened?
刚才发生了什么？


295
00:26:03.540 --> 00:26:06.550
She bears a goddess's Cosmo in the body of a mortal.
她以凡人之躯承载着一个女神的小宇宙


296
00:26:13.430 --> 00:26:17.220
When our sensors detect a potential Cosmo burst,
当我们的传感器检测到潜在的小宇宙爆发时


297
00:26:17.930 --> 00:26:20.600
the building automatically blocks the signal.
建筑物就会自动屏蔽信号


298
00:26:21.690 --> 00:26:24.940
It's the only way we can keep Sienna hidden from Guraad.
只有这样才能不让古拉杜发现沙织


299
00:26:25.220 --> 00:26:28.060
Which is why I am stuck here like a prisoner.
这就是我像囚犯一样被困在这里的原因


300
00:26:32.070 --> 00:26:33.080
Excuse me.
打扰一下


301
00:26:34.550 --> 00:26:37.340
Wait. Wait, so... So you really are...?
等等, 那么...你真的是...


302
00:26:48.300 --> 00:26:50.840
You really think this guy could beat the Pegasus Knight?
你真的认为这家伙能打败天马座圣斗士？


303
00:26:51.470 --> 00:26:54.090
Perhaps. If we give him the prototype.
也许吧 如果我们给他一套暗黑圣衣的话


304
00:27:07.650 --> 00:27:09.150
Next candidate?
下一个候选人？


305
00:27:13.660 --> 00:27:14.660
You giving up already?
你已经放弃了？


306
00:27:25.580 --> 00:27:27.380
What the hell are you made of?
你到底是什么做的？


307
00:27:28.800 --> 00:27:29.760
Disengage.
别打了


308
00:27:34.330 --> 00:27:35.790
We ain't done yet.
我们还没完呢


309
00:27:41.480 --> 00:27:43.810
You made your point, Cassios.
你说得很清楚, 卡西欧士


310
00:27:43.870 --> 00:27:45.170
You're a strong man.
你是个坚强的人


311
00:27:45.900 --> 00:27:48.230
But you're just a man.
但你只是个人


312
00:27:53.400 --> 00:27:54.700
I have a problem.
我有个麻烦


313
00:27:55.240 --> 00:27:56.950
You met him in your ring.
你在你的擂台上见过他


314
00:27:57.470 --> 00:27:58.310
The kid.
那个孩子


315
00:27:58.430 --> 00:28:00.260
His power's a liability.
他的力量是个负担


316
00:28:00.760 --> 00:28:04.550
Once he learns to control it, no living man will be able to stop him.
一旦他学会控制它, 任何活人都无法阻止他


317
00:28:05.750 --> 00:28:07.710
What, you think I could, though?
怎么, 你觉得我可以吗？


318
00:28:08.290 --> 00:28:10.630
You know, with your prototype thing?
穿上你那暗黑圣衣？


319
00:28:11.500 --> 00:28:12.500
I have a good ear.
我的耳朵很灵


320
00:28:13.590 --> 00:28:14.930
So, what's your price?
那么, 你想要多少钱？


321
00:28:17.330 --> 00:28:18.590
Well, that depends.
那要看情况了


322
00:28:19.860 --> 00:28:21.030
Can I kill him?
我能杀了他吗？


323
00:28:21.060 --> 00:28:22.720
That's kind of the point.
这才是重点


324
00:28:23.730 --> 00:28:25.170
I'll do it for free.
我免费帮你


325
00:28:51.040 --> 00:28:53.340
- You all right? - I'm better.
- 你还好吗？ - 我好多了


326
00:28:54.510 --> 00:28:57.430
- You? - I'm good. I guess.
- 你呢？ - 我很好 我想


327
00:28:59.300 --> 00:29:01.970
It's just that I can't believe you really are a...
只是我不敢相信你真的是一个...


328
00:29:02.060 --> 00:29:03.060
A goddess?
女神？


329
00:29:05.180 --> 00:29:06.980
I'm never gonna call you that.
我永远不会那样叫你的


330
00:29:07.370 --> 00:29:09.080
That's fine with me.
我没意见


331
00:29:10.060 --> 00:29:13.860
So how do people usually react when they learn you're Athena?
那么, 当人们知道你是雅典娜时, 通常会有什么反应呢？


332
00:29:14.970 --> 00:29:15.810
Varies.
各不相同


333
00:29:16.610 --> 00:29:19.530
Like, the day after I was born, someone tried to kill me.
比如, 我出生的第二天, 就有人想杀我


334
00:29:19.710 --> 00:29:20.720
No.
不


335
00:29:22.490 --> 00:29:25.620
Not even you could annoy someone that much in just one day.
即使是你, 也不可能在一天之内就那样惹恼一个人


336
00:29:26.540 --> 00:29:29.830
I was told a knight in gold armor gave his life to save mine.
他们告诉我, 一位穿着黄金圣衣的圣斗士为救我献出了生命


337
00:29:31.290 --> 00:29:33.830
When they found him, he was still holding me in his arms.
当他们找到他时, 他还抱着我


338
00:29:33.920 --> 00:29:35.920
Who found you? Alman?
谁找到你的？光政？


339
00:29:36.840 --> 00:29:37.840
And Guraad.
还有古拉杜


340
00:29:40.380 --> 00:29:42.880
Though she was a little more into the gold armor.
虽然她更喜欢黄金圣衣


341
00:29:43.930 --> 00:29:47.560
Used it to develop technology far beyond anything you could imagine.
利用它开发出来的技术远远超出你的想象


342
00:29:48.790 --> 00:29:49.830
Look at the bright side.
往好的方面看


343
00:29:51.220 --> 00:29:53.260
Half your foster family is great.
你的寄养家庭至少有一半还不错


344
00:29:54.360 --> 00:29:56.990
When Alman's around you, he almost looks like a real dad.
当光政在你身边时, 他几乎就像一个真正的父亲


345
00:29:58.450 --> 00:30:01.700
Alman is my dad, and I love him more than anything in the world.
光政就是我的父亲, 我爱他胜过世界上的一切


346
00:30:03.360 --> 00:30:07.240
Although that might be hard for you to understand, street boy.
虽然你可能很难理解, 街头小子


347
00:30:08.750 --> 00:30:09.750
I do.
我能理解


348
00:30:12.820 --> 00:30:14.650
I had someone like that once.
我曾经也有过这样的亲人


349
00:30:16.340 --> 00:30:17.340
Your sister?
你姐姐？


350
00:30:20.050 --> 00:30:21.300
What was she like?
她是个什么样的人？


351
00:30:23.310 --> 00:30:24.770
She was kind.
她很善良


352
00:30:26.950 --> 00:30:28.160
<i>And strong.</i>
<i>也很强大</i>


353
00:30:29.390 --> 00:30:31.940
And protected me when I couldn't protect myself.
在我还不能保护自己的时候保护着我


354
00:30:33.460 --> 00:30:35.420
And you won't stop until you find her.
不找到她, 你是不会罢休的


355
00:30:35.900 --> 00:30:38.860
You really don't care that I've become your bodyguard, do you?
你真的不在乎我当不当你的保镖，是吗？


356
00:30:39.460 --> 00:30:41.670
I will someday become Athena.
总有一天, 我会成为雅典娜


357
00:30:42.200 --> 00:30:43.620
I don't have a choice.
我别无选择


358
00:30:43.700 --> 00:30:46.370
But that doesn't mean you have to become the Pegasus Knight.
但这并不意味着你必须成为天马座圣斗士


359
00:30:46.400 --> 00:30:48.070
Alman said it's my destiny.
光政说这是我的命运


360
00:30:48.500 --> 00:30:50.500
Nobody's destiny is written in stone.
没有人的命运是一成不变的


361
00:30:51.770 --> 00:30:52.860
Except yours.
除了你的


362
00:30:54.330 --> 00:30:56.170
Your Cosmo bursts,
你的小宇宙爆发时


363
00:30:56.260 --> 00:30:58.010
do they come with visions?
会有幻象出现吗？


364
00:30:58.710 --> 00:31:00.050
You have visions too?
你也有幻象？


365
00:31:00.130 --> 00:31:01.300
What does it matter?
这有什么意义吗？


366
00:31:01.400 --> 00:31:05.570
Cosmo visions are a window into the universe.
小宇宙幻象是一扇通往宇宙的窗户


367
00:31:06.930 --> 00:31:08.540
They can show us things.
可以向我们展示一些事情


368
00:31:11.520 --> 00:31:14.190
So that Silver Knight your dad mentioned...?
你爸爸提到的那个白银圣斗士....？


369
00:31:14.270 --> 00:31:15.900
- Who, Marin? - Marin.
- 谁, 魔铃？ - 魔铃


370
00:31:15.980 --> 00:31:18.530
Do you think if he could teach me to control my Cosmo,
你觉得如果他能教我控制我的小宇宙的话


371
00:31:18.560 --> 00:31:20.320
I could use it to find my sister?
我可以用它找到我姐姐吗？


372
00:31:21.430 --> 00:31:22.470
Maybe.
也许吧


373
00:31:24.410 --> 00:31:25.620
If that's what you want.
如果这就是你想要的


374
00:32:00.650 --> 00:32:02.950
He's drained of Cosmo, Guraad.
他的小宇宙被吸干了, 古拉杜


375
00:32:06.250 --> 00:32:07.790
Won't get another dose.
不用再来一轮了


376
00:32:10.070 --> 00:32:12.610
The prototype procedure has started.
暗黑圣衣程序已启动


377
00:32:13.080 --> 00:32:14.580
It'll be ready tomorrow.
明天就好了


378
00:32:15.290 --> 00:32:16.380
Any issues?
有问题吗？


379
00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:18.000
Just one.
只有一个


380
00:32:19.090 --> 00:32:20.420
Why Cassios?
为什么是卡西欧士？


381
00:32:21.050 --> 00:32:22.460
'Cause you failed.
因为你失败了


382
00:32:24.640 --> 00:32:28.100
You know, the target was assisted by Alman Kido.
要知道, 目标有城户光政的协助


383
00:32:28.210 --> 00:32:30.170
A personal bad penny.
私人旧债


384
00:32:31.890 --> 00:32:33.730
Athena's growing stronger by the day,
雅典娜越来越强大了


385
00:32:33.820 --> 00:32:36.660
and now she'll have the Pegasus Knight by her side.
现在, 她将由天马座圣斗士守护着


386
00:32:36.730 --> 00:32:40.730
I reckon the boy's got some Cosmo. Doesn't mean he's a knight yet.
我觉得这孩子是有点小宇宙了 并不意味着他已经是圣斗士了


387
00:32:40.940 --> 00:32:42.740
I don't need cold comfort, Nero.
我不需要冷冰冰的安慰, 尼禄


388
00:32:42.860 --> 00:32:45.530
I need to know where on Earth Alman is hiding the girl.
我要知道光政到底把那女孩藏在哪儿了


389
00:32:45.620 --> 00:32:48.170
So we can neutralize her before she becomes Athena
这样我们就能在她变成雅典娜并毁灭世界之前


390
00:32:48.200 --> 00:32:49.570
and destroys the world.
解除她的威胁


391
00:32:51.160 --> 00:32:52.200
Beats me.
难住我了


392
00:32:54.120 --> 00:32:56.080
But you could always ask our prisoner.
不过, 你可以问问我们的囚犯


393
00:32:59.130 --> 00:33:00.500
We have a prisoner?
我们抓了一个囚犯？


394
00:33:36.650 --> 00:33:37.480
Hey!
嘿！


395
00:33:38.540 --> 00:33:39.670
Hey, wait up.
嘿, 等等


396
00:33:40.420 --> 00:33:41.460
Yeah?
怎么了？


397
00:33:42.710 --> 00:33:46.510
I...I just figured you could focus more on your training if you weren't
我只是在想, 你应该可以更专注于你的训练


398
00:33:46.590 --> 00:33:49.090
worried about where your next meal was coming from.
如果不用担心下一顿饭从哪里来的话


399
00:33:51.130 --> 00:33:52.040
Thanks.
谢谢


400
00:33:59.650 --> 00:34:00.780

401
00:34:01.920 --> 00:34:02.860
I guess.

402
00:34:05.780 --> 00:34:06.780
Seiya!
星矢


403
00:34:07.790 --> 00:34:08.910
Time to go.
该走了


404
00:34:11.660 --> 00:34:12.660
See you.
再见


405
00:34:15.870 --> 00:34:16.870
Take a seat.
请坐


406
00:34:21.730 --> 00:34:23.560
Don't get any big ideas.
不要想法太多


407

A knight's power comes from within.

You give up?

The Pegasus armor is...

You must calm down.

So much trouble for one little girl.

是啊, 我都不知道那是什么意思

意思就是 你拿棍棒敲两下就想拆除核弹 那是不可能的

No! No, you don't wanna do that.

You don't understand.

He did it because of me.

我只记得当时她抱着我, 而我毁了她的手臂

下一秒, 她就奄奄一息, 而这一切都是我的错

光政用黄金圣衣的力量救了她

但自从事故发生后, 古拉杜就需要靠小宇宙来维持生命

01:01:00.100 --> 01:01:02.180
So what? You've got plenty of it.

Athena's Cosmo's too powerful. It would kill her.
雅典娜的小宇宙力量太强大了 会杀了她的

Once Guraad figured that out, she let her go.

665
01:01:23.710 --> 01:01:25.540
That's why she never came back.

她开始相信雅典娜重生就是为了结束这个世界

Your sister wasn't the only one.

We left them all behind.

How many kids did your family take?

We don't stand a chance.
