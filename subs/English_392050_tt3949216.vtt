00:00:02.151 --> 00:00:06.722
Hey, hey! You're listening to
Doc George on WAGG The wag!


2
00:00:24.305 --> 00:00:25.775
I know it's only Thursday,

3
00:00:25.808 --> 00:00:28.710
but my phone's ringing off the
hook about a full moon party


4
00:00:28.744 --> 00:00:32.481
tonight out at the old cotton
gin. That means there's going to


5
00:00:32.513 --> 00:00:35.584
be juvenile delinquents all over
town trying to get us to buy


6
00:00:35.618 --> 00:00:38.321
them liquor. So remember
if one approaches you,


7
00:00:38.354 --> 00:00:39.854
don't be a complete
douche! Buy it


8
00:00:39.887 --> 00:00:43.192
for them. It's tough enough
being a teenager without having


9
00:00:43.225 --> 00:00:46.628
to go to lame parties with no
freaking booze!


10
00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.350
Speaking of getting arrested.
Marion High is sending some


11
00:01:07.383 --> 00:01:09.952
students to our historical jail
house, where they'll stay


12
00:01:09.984 --> 00:01:12.954
overnight while people post
bail money for their release.


13
00:01:12.987 --> 00:01:16.691
So... so basically our public
school system


14
00:01:16.725 --> 00:01:19.494
is forcing students to spend
the night in a formally


15
00:01:19.528 --> 00:01:21.963
condemned murder scene... out in
the middle of nowhere...


16
00:01:21.996 --> 00:01:24.366
because apparently,
the public school


17
00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:27.403
system wasn't already
dangerous enough?


18
00:01:53.895 --> 00:01:55.698
What's up? You're
on the air with Doc. George...


19
00:01:55.731 --> 00:01:59.467
Yeah, Doc, so my buddy got
dumped by this cheerleader...


20
00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:00.735
but he can't let it go.

21
00:02:00.768 --> 00:02:03.472
Is the trampy
Cheerleader seeing someone new?


22
00:02:03.505 --> 00:02:05.640
Yeah only,
like, our star jock...


23
00:02:05.674 --> 00:02:07.410
This jock
have a nice car?


24
00:02:07.443 --> 00:02:08.611
Yeah...

25
00:02:08.643 --> 00:02:10.479
Okay... here's what
I got to say about this...


26
00:02:10.511 --> 00:02:11.779
Okay...

27
00:02:11.813 --> 00:02:12.747
Stop calling into the
station...


28
00:02:12.781 --> 00:02:15.284
I'm not a
real doctor, pinheads!


29
00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:48.750
So what exactly did she say?

30
00:02:50.351 --> 00:02:53.622
The worst three words in
the English language, Cliff.


31
00:02:55.523 --> 00:02:57.026
"I'm pregnant?"

32
00:02:57.058 --> 00:03:00.462
That's two words.

33
00:03:00.496 --> 00:03:04.300
"I-am-pregnant."
It just sounds really formal


34
00:03:04.332 --> 00:03:05.500
like that, you know?

35
00:03:05.533 --> 00:03:06.968
"Like a brother."

36
00:03:08.403 --> 00:03:10.105
Man.

37
00:03:10.605 --> 00:03:12.407
She said I couldn't
be in a relationship


38
00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:15.912
with her because I'm
"like a brother" to her.


39
00:03:17.345 --> 00:03:19.448
That sucks man, I'm sorry.

40
00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:21.550
It's worse than
the "friend zone."


41
00:03:22.617 --> 00:03:24.652
It's pretty much
the same thing, right?


42
00:03:24.686 --> 00:03:28.924
No! No, it's not! Because
best friends will make


43
00:03:28.956 --> 00:03:31.593
stupid mistakes and get drunk
and make out.


44
00:03:31.627 --> 00:03:34.730
But "like a brother?"

45
00:03:34.762 --> 00:03:37.432
You don't make out with your
brother, man.


46
00:03:37.466 --> 00:03:40.869
You really, really shouldn't.

47
00:03:57.051 --> 00:03:59.087
Man I really liked her.

48
00:03:59.121 --> 00:04:02.091
Hey. There's plenty
of fish in the sea, bro.


49
00:04:02.123 --> 00:04:04.392
Don't call me bro.

50
00:04:04.426 --> 00:04:05.861
I'm sorry, is it too soon?

51
00:04:05.893 --> 00:04:07.028
Cliff...

52
00:04:07.062 --> 00:04:10.131
No, just listen. I'm
gonna piss. Then we're gonna


53
00:04:10.164 --> 00:04:12.634
find some
girls. Kapeesh?


54
00:04:14.535 --> 00:04:15.437
Kyle?

55
00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:17.039
What?

56
00:04:17.072 --> 00:04:25.047
Take me to pound town. Take me
to pound town, Kyle! Woo-Wooo!


57
00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:27.950
Be right back...

58
00:04:34.823 --> 00:04:37.693
Hey.

59
00:04:53.575 --> 00:04:55.711
C'mon.

60
00:04:58.447 --> 00:05:01.717
C'mon, you've got
to pump harder than that.


61
00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:06.855
I know, I know..."That's what
she said." But it's true. Here.


62
00:05:17.032 --> 00:05:18.967
Sorry... I've
never actually...


63
00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:20.436
operated... one of
these before.


64
00:05:20.469 --> 00:05:23.439
Well, you never
forget your first time.


65
00:05:23.472 --> 00:05:25.640
That's what she said.

66
00:05:25.674 --> 00:05:27.176
Nice...

67
00:05:27.209 --> 00:05:29.879
So you've done
this before, obviously.


68
00:05:29.912 --> 00:05:32.181
Yeah, well, sneaking
around and drinking beer


69
00:05:32.214 --> 00:05:35.551
is pretty much the
only thing to do in Greenwood.


70
00:05:35.584 --> 00:05:38.621
That's a drive. Do
you have friends here?


71
00:05:38.654 --> 00:05:43.791
No, but Rusty does. I
just came along for the ride.


72
00:05:43.825 --> 00:05:47.496
Rusty, so. He's, like...
your boyfriend?


73
00:05:47.529 --> 00:05:52.166
No! He's, like, my brother.

74
00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:55.170
And what is so funny?

75
00:05:55.202 --> 00:05:57.705
Those are the
three best words


76
00:05:57.738 --> 00:05:59.541
in the English
language.


77
00:05:59.808 --> 00:06:02.945
Well, technically, four?

78
00:06:02.977 --> 00:06:05.079
Never mind.

79
00:06:05.113 --> 00:06:06.749
C'mon...

80
00:06:06.782 --> 00:06:08.017
You don't want any beer?

81
00:06:08.049 --> 00:06:11.986
I brought my own. You
finish that foamy piss-beer


82
00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:13.955
and I'll get you some of the
good stuff.


83
00:06:13.988 --> 00:06:17.493
You brought your own beer?
What'd you come to the keg for?


84
00:06:17.525 --> 00:06:21.663
Why did I
come to the keg...?


85
00:06:30.606 --> 00:06:34.944
Here ya go. You're not going
to need this where we're going.


86
00:06:36.979 --> 00:06:38.180
Rusty. Clark.

87
00:06:38.212 --> 00:06:40.015
Rusty.

88
00:07:00.301 --> 00:07:02.804
Here.

89
00:07:02.837 --> 00:07:05.808
Wha... Ok.

90
00:07:09.645 --> 00:07:12.880
So where'd you get beer?

91
00:07:12.914 --> 00:07:16.250
Rusty's looked 21
since he was, like, 12.


92
00:07:16.284 --> 00:07:20.089
That's... convenient...

93
00:07:21.022 --> 00:07:24.325
Kyle! Dude! We're playing
truth or dare! You in?


94
00:07:24.359 --> 00:07:26.794
No, man. I'm good.

95
00:07:26.827 --> 00:07:30.065
Awesome.
I dare you to kiss that chick.


96
00:07:30.097 --> 00:07:32.634
Aha...

97
00:07:32.667 --> 00:07:37.705
Come on! Just do it!

98
00:07:37.738 --> 00:07:39.241
Don't you want to?

99
00:07:52.020 --> 00:07:54.356
Yea! That's what
I'm talking about.


100
00:07:54.388 --> 00:07:57.158
Alright. Now you,
girl. What's your name?


101
00:07:57.191 --> 00:07:58.993
Hey, yeah, what is your...

102
00:07:59.027 --> 00:08:00.128
Dare.

103
00:08:00.162 --> 00:08:06.000
Brave! Ok, Brave Girl.
I dare you to go


104
00:08:06.034 --> 00:08:09.705
into the woods and see if you
can spot the Jail Ghost.


105
00:08:09.738 --> 00:08:12.307
The what ghost?

106
00:08:12.339 --> 00:08:17.212
The Marion County Jail
ghost. It's an old wives' tale...


107
00:08:17.245 --> 00:08:23.385
What, the old Jail Ghost? Naw,
it's real. And, technically,


108
00:08:23.417 --> 00:08:26.254
it's an urban legend not a
wive's tale.


109
00:08:26.287 --> 00:08:27.188
It's the same thing.

110
00:08:27.222 --> 00:08:30.726
It's not. And it's real.

111
00:08:35.263 --> 00:08:36.265
Girl shouldn't go
out into the woods


112
00:08:36.298 --> 00:08:41.671
alone. Not without... a...
protection.


113
00:08:42.036 --> 00:08:43.237
What are you doing?

114
00:08:43.270 --> 00:08:44.673
All right, let's go.

115
00:08:44.706 --> 00:08:45.707
What?

116
00:08:45.741 --> 00:08:46.942
Go for it.

117
00:08:49.111 --> 00:08:56.117
Kyle! Go for it,
buddy. Be a hero. Go!


118
00:08:57.149 --> 00:08:57.786
Come on.

119
00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:02.223
[whispered He's
going to poundtown.


120
00:09:14.336 --> 00:09:16.904
You fall a lot.

121
00:09:16.938 --> 00:09:18.439
It's been, like, two miles.

122
00:09:18.472 --> 00:09:20.775
It's barely been a mile.

123
00:09:22.043 --> 00:09:25.279
I knew that. I
was just testing you.


124
00:09:25.313 --> 00:09:28.049
So, a "jail" ghost? Scary.

125
00:09:28.082 --> 00:09:31.853
There's no Jail Ghost.
It's just some bullshit story


126
00:09:31.886 --> 00:09:34.323
about a family who got murdered
by some crazy guy.


127
00:09:34.356 --> 00:09:35.758
Have you ever even been there?

128
00:09:35.790 --> 00:09:39.827
No. It's condemned or being
rebuilt. The school's hosting a


129
00:09:39.861 --> 00:09:42.431
lock-in to get some kids to stay
there overnight, though.


130
00:09:42.463 --> 00:09:45.800
I love that kind of
creepy stuff, don't you?


131
00:09:45.833 --> 00:09:47.803
What? No.

132
00:09:47.836 --> 00:09:52.106
So... Can we go see the jail?

133
00:09:52.140 --> 00:09:56.010
See, that's the thing.
It's really not that close.


134
00:09:56.044 --> 00:09:58.746
And... I think we're headed
towards the lake.


135
00:09:58.779 --> 00:10:03.184
Lake? well I guess we'll

136
00:10:03.217 --> 00:10:06.454
just have to settle for a
swim, then.


137
00:10:06.487 --> 00:10:10.525
What? Are you crazy?
It's like 10 degrees out...


138
00:10:13.194 --> 00:10:16.198
Swimming it is then.

139
00:10:27.976 --> 00:10:29.378
C'mon, Kyle!

140
00:10:38.252 --> 00:10:41.389
So this... is pound town.

141
00:10:41.423 --> 00:10:42.892
C'mon, Kyle!

142
00:10:44.959 --> 00:10:45.960
Did you hear that?

143
00:10:47.261 --> 00:10:50.531
Kyle, girls don't get
any more naked than this,


144
00:10:50.564 --> 00:11:00.564
Right! Okay. Lake. Smoking
hot chick. This happens, right?


145
00:11:00.976 --> 00:11:03.979
Hey you haven't even
told me your name yet...


146
00:11:04.411 --> 00:11:06.514
It's "Marie."

147
00:11:16.991 --> 00:11:20.161
Rusty... right?

148
00:11:23.298 --> 00:11:25.500
Look, I wasn't going
to try anything. She made


149
00:11:25.533 --> 00:11:28.404
me follow her out here, and
she's really insistent.


150
00:11:39.146 --> 00:11:42.150
Rusty!? Were you following me?

151
00:11:42.183 --> 00:11:44.952
Dude! What's your problem, man?

152
00:11:44.986 --> 00:11:46.288
You didn't even know her name?

153
00:11:46.321 --> 00:11:48.390
What kind of a desperate
sleaze are you?


154
00:11:48.423 --> 00:11:50.458
God, Rusty,
leave him alone...


155
00:11:50.491 --> 00:11:52.493
Get out of the water and
get your clothes on. Now!


156
00:11:52.526 --> 00:11:55.229
You always do this! You
ruin every party we ever go to


157
00:11:55.263 --> 00:11:58.200
Party's over anyway.
Everyone's leaving. C'mon!


158
00:11:58.232 --> 00:12:01.335
Look, Rusty, she told me
that you weren't her boyfriend.


159
00:12:01.369 --> 00:12:03.972
I know it sucks that you
couldn't seal the deal,


160
00:12:04.005 --> 00:12:05.374
but that's not my fault.

161
00:12:05.406 --> 00:12:09.143
Here we go...

162
00:12:11.212 --> 00:12:13.649
What did you say?

163
00:12:17.952 --> 00:12:19.587
No, What I meant was...

164
00:12:19.621 --> 00:12:22.558
That's my baby sister!

165
00:12:23.357 --> 00:12:25.626
Why didn't you tell me that?

166
00:12:25.659 --> 00:12:28.496
I did! I said
"He's, like, my brother!"


167
00:12:28.529 --> 00:12:31.065
I thought you meant he
was "like" your brother...


168
00:12:31.098 --> 00:12:32.333
What?

169
00:12:32.366 --> 00:12:35.036
What?

170
00:12:38.606 --> 00:12:39.975
Rusty, stop!

171
00:12:42.544 --> 00:12:45.948
Stop hitting him and
give me my shirt, you asshole!


172
00:12:47.615 --> 00:12:50.952
Alright, you know what,
fine. I'll get it myself.


173
00:13:27.054 --> 00:13:28.424
The hell was that?

174
00:13:43.337 --> 00:13:49.111
Marie? Damnit.

175
00:13:50.111 --> 00:13:52.448
Marie Come on. We're getting the
hell outta...


176
00:13:54.982 --> 00:13:58.386
Marie? Marie!

177
00:14:11.366 --> 00:14:21.366
Hey! Hey! No, come on!
Why would you...? Damn it!


178
00:14:34.222 --> 00:14:37.159
"Party's moving to Katie's.
Can you get a ride


179
00:14:37.192 --> 00:14:40.395
back with that chick
and her brother?"


180
00:14:40.428 --> 00:14:42.731
Was I the only person
who didn't know that


181
00:14:42.764 --> 00:14:45.334
douche was her brother?

182
00:14:47.135 --> 00:14:50.371
Hey, this is Cliff. Remember,
my mom checks my messages.


183
00:14:50.404 --> 00:14:54.409
If you've have something
bad to say, say it in code.


184
00:14:54.442 --> 00:14:57.546
Look, get your ass back
here right now and pick me up!


185
00:14:57.578 --> 00:15:00.448
That chick's brother
is a total sociopath...


186
00:15:01.249 --> 00:15:05.187
Look I'm wet I'm cold,
I lost my frickin shirt,


187
00:15:05.220 --> 00:15:07.823
and I smell like... wet dog.

188
00:15:08.590 --> 00:15:17.732
Please. Cliff. Look. I just...
I want to get the hell out of


189
00:15:17.765 --> 00:15:24.438
here. This night took the
biggest turn for the worst, and


190
00:15:24.472 --> 00:15:28.443
I just I can't deal with it. ok
I really need you to come pick


191
00:15:28.476 --> 00:15:33.048
me up. I'm scared and I'm
stranded out here. Please.


192
00:15:33.081 --> 00:15:35.284
Just. Call me
back.


193
00:15:42.689 --> 00:15:47.095
Rusty, I swear to God,
I didn't touch her.


194
00:17:54.688 --> 00:17:55.890
Yeah, at the old Gin & Smooch.

195
00:17:55.923 --> 00:17:58.492
2 Yeah, I've been there
once, that's where they're


196
00:17:58.525 --> 00:17:59.693
having the party.

197
00:17:59.726 --> 00:18:00.996
I like beer!

198
00:18:04.431 --> 00:18:05.733
Hey, Crystal.

199
00:18:05.766 --> 00:18:10.838
Hey. Hi. Donny.
What's up?


200
00:18:10.871 --> 00:18:12.841
So, I hear you're
off to the jail tonight?


201
00:18:12.873 --> 00:18:18.612
Yeah. Yeah, hard
time for hard cash.


202
00:18:18.646 --> 00:18:21.683
Beats a candy sale,
I guess, right?


203
00:18:21.716 --> 00:18:23.918
Right yeah. Listen,
I hear Chase is in?


204
00:18:23.950 --> 00:18:27.354
Chase.

205
00:18:27.388 --> 00:18:29.457
Yeah, she's going, right?
I mean, you know,


206
00:18:29.489 --> 00:18:30.558
To represent
the cheerleaders?


207
00:18:31.892 --> 00:18:33.794
Well, you know
the bail money goes


208
00:18:33.828 --> 00:18:35.363
to the whole school, overall.

209
00:18:35.396 --> 00:18:37.699
So she she's not so much
representing the "cheerleaders"


210
00:18:37.732 --> 00:18:40.601
as she is raising
money for the entire school...


211
00:18:40.634 --> 00:18:42.970
Awesome, Awesome, Awesome.
Talk to you later!


212
00:18:43.004 --> 00:18:46.474
Right. Okay.
You're welcome.


213
00:18:46.506 --> 00:18:50.010
And... thanks for totally
validating my angsty teenaged


214
00:18:50.044 --> 00:18:53.849
bitterness toward jocks and
cheerleaders.


215
00:18:56.984 --> 00:18:58.654
Mr. Howell?

216
00:18:59.786 --> 00:19:01.422
Mr. Howell?

217
00:19:01.688 --> 00:19:04.692
Well, hello.

218
00:19:04.726 --> 00:19:08.396
I'm Donny. I play
for the basketball team.


219
00:19:08.428 --> 00:19:11.365
Our basketball
team. Here. At school.


220
00:19:11.399 --> 00:19:14.268
I'm aware of the team.
I've just never seen you play.


221
00:19:14.302 --> 00:19:16.871
Well, yeah, I'm not first
string, but I play in scrimmages


222
00:19:16.903 --> 00:19:20.407
Sorry, I mean I never go to
games. I find sports very dull.


223
00:19:20.440 --> 00:19:24.312
But fostering a competitive
spirit, now that's exciting.


224
00:19:24.344 --> 00:19:28.816
Competition, rivalry. Keys to
evolution and survival.


225
00:19:28.850 --> 00:19:30.118
Right...

226
00:19:30.151 --> 00:19:31.585
Every living creature
participates in some form of


227
00:19:31.619 --> 00:19:34.621
sport, whether it's to pass
along their genetic code,


228
00:19:34.655 --> 00:19:39.528
claim the best territory or
find their next meal...


229
00:19:40.794 --> 00:19:41.996
You coming?

230
00:19:42.028 --> 00:19:43.630
yeah, yeah.

231
00:19:43.663 --> 00:19:45.467
So I actually wanted
to talk to you about


232
00:19:45.499 --> 00:19:46.700
your fundraiser...
the jail thing?


233
00:19:46.734 --> 00:19:47.901
Bail Out Our School!

234
00:19:47.935 --> 00:19:48.703
Right, yeah.

235
00:19:48.736 --> 00:19:49.771
Made the flyer myself.

236
00:19:49.803 --> 00:19:50.638
Did you?

237
00:19:50.670 --> 00:19:51.538
Photoshop.

238
00:19:52.406 --> 00:19:53.174
Beats a candy sale?

239
00:19:53.207 --> 00:19:55.043
That's what people are saying.

240
00:19:55.075 --> 00:19:56.777
Really, people are saying that?

241
00:19:56.811 --> 00:19:58.746
Listen, Marty Marshall
said he was going to


242
00:19:58.780 --> 00:20:00.048
represent
the athletics department.


243
00:20:00.082 --> 00:20:02.383
Marty Marshall.
Basketball team. First-string.


244
00:20:02.417 --> 00:20:04.319
I thought you didn't...

245
00:20:04.351 --> 00:20:06.487
I read the student
paper. Very thorough reporting.


246
00:20:06.521 --> 00:20:08.056
Apparently He's quite the
athlete.


247
00:20:08.089 --> 00:20:11.359
Right, anyway. Marty said
something came up, or something,


248
00:20:11.391 --> 00:20:14.795
Really? Well that's disappointing.
Really won't


249
00:20:14.829 --> 00:20:15.996
draw the same kind of
attention...


250
00:20:16.030 --> 00:20:18.533
Well, I asked him if
I could take his place,


251
00:20:18.565 --> 00:20:19.767
and I wanted to make sure,
that was okay with you


252
00:20:19.801 --> 00:20:20.936
you know, that it was that's
cool.


253
00:20:20.968 --> 00:20:24.605
Yes, Donny.
That would be very cool.


254
00:20:24.639 --> 00:20:26.174
Of course you can participate.

255
00:20:26.207 --> 00:20:28.743
Meet us at the gym at
six p.m. bring an overnight bag,


256
00:20:28.775 --> 00:20:29.643
and a sense of adventure!

257
00:20:29.677 --> 00:20:30.812
Thank you.

258
00:20:30.844 --> 00:20:34.481
Okay. Great.
Should be fun! Marty's gonna


259
00:20:34.515 --> 00:20:36.851
regret giving up his spot!

260
00:20:37.951 --> 00:20:39.219
You gave up your spot?!

261
00:20:39.254 --> 00:20:42.357
Yeah. I never wanted to
do that stupid lock-in crap


262
00:20:42.390 --> 00:20:43.658
in the first place.

263
00:20:43.691 --> 00:20:46.093
Of course you didn't want
to do the stupid lock-in crap!


264
00:20:46.127 --> 00:20:49.664
Want has nothing to do with it,
Marty. We are role models. We


265
00:20:49.697 --> 00:20:53.668
have a responsibility...
plus you promised you'd do it, too.


266
00:20:53.700 --> 00:20:56.136
Babe, I didn't.
I didn't promise I'd do it, ok,


267
00:20:56.169 --> 00:20:58.840
I "said" I'd do it. There's a
big difference.


268
00:20:58.872 --> 00:21:00.808
How is there a difference?

269
00:21:00.842 --> 00:21:02.610
When you promise you'll
do something, you actually want


270
00:21:02.642 --> 00:21:04.746
to do it. When you say you'll
do something, you're


271
00:21:04.778 --> 00:21:05.780
just being nice.

272
00:21:06.647 --> 00:21:08.483
Who's taking your place?

273
00:21:08.515 --> 00:21:08.949
Donny.

274
00:21:08.983 --> 00:21:09.517
Donny.

275
00:21:09.550 --> 00:21:10.051
Yeah.

276
00:21:10.083 --> 00:21:10.717
Donny Harlan?

277
00:21:10.751 --> 00:21:12.053
Yeah. Donny.

278
00:21:12.085 --> 00:21:14.721
You know, most guys who found
out their girlfriend was going


279
00:21:14.755 --> 00:21:17.559
to an overnight with her ex...
boyfriend wouldn't be so...


280
00:21:17.592 --> 00:21:19.526
nonchalant.

281
00:21:19.560 --> 00:21:22.030
Babe, I don't even know what
that means. Okay? And it's not


282
00:21:22.063 --> 00:21:24.666
like you and donny still have a
thing, So it's cool, right?


283
00:21:24.698 --> 00:21:26.000
I guess so...

284
00:21:26.034 --> 00:21:28.803
Besides, it's not even like
a date. That Crystal chick is


285
00:21:28.835 --> 00:21:30.838
going too, She can be
your... what do you call it?


286
00:21:30.871 --> 00:21:32.140
A chaperone?

287
00:21:32.173 --> 00:21:36.143
Not a chaperone, more like
like a wingman, except a girl.


288
00:21:36.177 --> 00:21:39.546
A wingman is
someone who-never mind.


289
00:21:39.580 --> 00:21:41.149
Look, just call me when you get
bailed out, and I can probably


290
00:21:41.181 --> 00:21:43.817
come pick you up, alright,
we'll hit the Gin.


291
00:21:43.851 --> 00:21:46.588
Damn it. Fine.

292
00:21:46.621 --> 00:21:49.756
I'm still mad at you, though. I
swear you've managed to leave me


293
00:21:49.790 --> 00:21:51.559
stranded in the middle of
nowhere,


294
00:21:51.592 --> 00:21:53.527
with two rejects
and a weirdo teacher.


295
00:21:53.561 --> 00:21:54.795
I swear, I think I'd rather be

296
00:21:54.829 --> 00:21:56.030
Dead?

297
00:21:56.063 --> 00:22:02.070
What? No, morbid much?
I was going to say grounded.


298
00:22:12.846 --> 00:22:16.450
something bad is coming.
Something very bad, I'm afraid.


299
00:22:17.851 --> 00:22:20.955
Right, Mortimer. Like the time
you thought the government


300
00:22:20.987 --> 00:22:22.623
hid cameras on your farm to

301
00:22:22.657 --> 00:22:26.628
learn your secret organic
growing techniques.


302
00:22:26.660 --> 00:22:29.730
No... this is not like that.

303
00:22:29.764 --> 00:22:32.934
More like the time you thought
genetically-enhanced Emus were


304
00:22:32.967 --> 00:22:35.903
breeding unchecked in the hollow
outside your property?


305
00:22:35.937 --> 00:22:38.505
Yes! Thank you,
Sheriff. This is much more along


306
00:22:38.538 --> 00:22:40.240
that kinda line,
Right, Duncan?


307
00:22:41.641 --> 00:22:48.082
These two, do not
need your encouragement.


308
00:22:48.114 --> 00:22:52.120
Well... Good
morning, everyone...


309
00:22:55.221 --> 00:22:59.660
Could you deal with those old
fools, please, Deputy Marcus.


310
00:22:59.694 --> 00:23:02.063
Happy to.
Could you Old fools give me


311
00:23:02.095 --> 00:23:03.197
just one moment?

312
00:23:03.229 --> 00:23:04.265
Certainly.

313
00:23:04.297 --> 00:23:05.566
By all means, Deputy.

314
00:23:07.668 --> 00:23:09.102
Sheriff fanning
the flames again?


315
00:23:09.136 --> 00:23:11.039
Of course...

316
00:23:11.072 --> 00:23:14.008
Well, you know how he
loves a good campfire story.


317
00:23:16.544 --> 00:23:21.015
So... Mortimer,
Duncan... Evans


318
00:23:21.047 --> 00:23:23.517
Deputy, this is
a legitimate concern.


319
00:23:23.551 --> 00:23:25.086
There's something
going on in those woods.


320
00:23:25.986 --> 00:23:26.920
Has been for years.

321
00:23:26.954 --> 00:23:27.789
Decades!

322
00:23:27.822 --> 00:23:29.223
Decades and years!

323
00:23:29.255 --> 00:23:30.525
Exactly!

324
00:23:31.626 --> 00:23:33.595
Sorry... what exactly
is the point, here?


325
00:23:33.628 --> 00:23:36.130
Do you know what
tonight is, Deputy?


326
00:23:36.162 --> 00:23:38.565
The night before
I get to sleep in.


327
00:23:38.599 --> 00:23:44.072
Tonight is the anniversary
of the the Jail House Massacre.


328
00:23:46.207 --> 00:23:48.976
Real quick... do
we feel that "massacre"


329
00:23:49.009 --> 00:23:50.644
is a bit strong of
a strong word?


330
00:23:50.678 --> 00:23:52.813
It was just that
one small family.


331
00:23:53.848 --> 00:23:56.050
the youngest boy did.
Survive...


332
00:23:56.082 --> 00:23:58.753
See. Three deaths. I mean, I
don't know the textbook minimum


333
00:23:58.785 --> 00:24:01.755
for a massacre, but it's got to
be closer to... seven?


334
00:24:01.788 --> 00:24:04.625
They did once hang
people in those cells, deputy.


335
00:24:04.659 --> 00:24:08.563
They hung one person
Mortimer. So... "people"...


336
00:24:08.595 --> 00:24:10.030
little bit of an
exaggeration.


337
00:24:10.063 --> 00:24:11.099
"Person." More
accurate.


338
00:24:11.131 --> 00:24:13.101
Don't go throwing
facts around, deputy...


339
00:24:13.133 --> 00:24:14.801
we're talking folklore
here.


340
00:24:14.834 --> 00:24:16.903
That's right.
Ain't that right Duncan?


341
00:24:16.937 --> 00:24:22.909
It was a night...
just like tonight...


342
00:24:22.942 --> 00:24:24.811
There was a moon...

343
00:24:24.844 --> 00:24:28.248
No!

344
00:24:28.282 --> 00:24:33.822
No, no. I am not
listening to this again.


345
00:24:35.221 --> 00:24:37.224
Go on...

346
00:24:40.960 --> 00:24:43.864
The sheriff and deputy Marcus
will be sure to prevent


347
00:24:43.898 --> 00:24:46.266
any further massacres.
In fact


348
00:24:46.300 --> 00:24:49.337
We'll make that
official sheriff-policy each and


349
00:24:49.370 --> 00:24:53.274
every full moon. Will that
satisfy you, gentleman?


350
00:24:53.306 --> 00:24:54.909
I just want to make
sure that he understands


351
00:24:54.941 --> 00:24:56.810
how serious the situation is...

352
00:24:58.411 --> 00:25:00.914
You're a deplorable
man, Sheriff.


353
00:25:00.948 --> 00:25:03.184
Come on, Arielle.
That's the charm of sheriffing.


354
00:25:03.217 --> 00:25:05.652
Townsfolk with their crazy
stories that we


355
00:25:05.686 --> 00:25:07.021
can't to take seriously.

356
00:25:07.053 --> 00:25:10.891
Was it just me, or did they seem
particularly spirited today?


357
00:25:10.925 --> 00:25:15.296
Villagers are restless
with rumors, Deputy.


358
00:25:15.329 --> 00:25:16.764
What's this?

359
00:25:16.796 --> 00:25:19.666
Missing person reports.
A brother and sister


360
00:25:19.699 --> 00:25:22.102
out of Greenwood, and
a local boy.


361
00:25:22.136 --> 00:25:26.808
Really? I mean... that's
terrible, I hope they're ok.


362
00:25:26.841 --> 00:25:29.944
How do we know they didn't just
go back to Greenwood together.


363
00:25:29.976 --> 00:25:34.181
Brother's truck was left at
the gin. They may have left with


364
00:25:34.215 --> 00:25:37.318
other kids, but so far
family hasn't heard from them...


365
00:25:37.351 --> 00:25:40.420
So... we have to investigate?

366
00:25:40.454 --> 00:25:43.024
Well before you get too worked
up. Remember, a missing person


367
00:25:43.056 --> 00:25:45.860
isn't a missing person till
they've been gone 48 hours.


368
00:25:45.892 --> 00:25:47.361
That's actually not true.

369
00:25:47.393 --> 00:25:49.262
24?

370
00:25:49.295 --> 00:25:50.765
Nope,
just a movie myth.


371
00:25:50.797 --> 00:25:51.765
Is it?

372
00:25:51.798 --> 00:25:53.433
Yes, sheriff.

373
00:25:53.467 --> 00:25:56.303
That's a good myth. We
should make that a real rule.


374
00:25:56.336 --> 00:25:57.804
Sir, these are kids...

375
00:25:57.839 --> 00:26:00.707
No... they're teenagers... who
are likely somewhere hung over,


376
00:26:00.740 --> 00:26:03.009
or high, or on their way back
from New Orleans


377
00:26:03.043 --> 00:26:04.812
with a bad tattoo.

378
00:26:04.844 --> 00:26:07.848
Well just to be proactive, maybe
we should go out and do some of


379
00:26:07.881 --> 00:26:11.017
that sheriff stuff. Just to
shake things up a bit.


380
00:26:11.051 --> 00:26:14.021
Alright Ellen, You are right.
And if I was a prudent


381
00:26:14.053 --> 00:26:17.390
and efficient sheriff,
when might I do all that?


382
00:26:17.423 --> 00:26:19.459
You'll have it done by the time
you get back from wherever it is


383
00:26:19.493 --> 00:26:22.163
you're going right now. Which,
you hope, is to take a shower.


384
00:26:22.196 --> 00:26:25.699
Spent the night working on the
cabin. Almost got her done.


385
00:26:27.168 --> 00:26:30.871
What? I'm serious... This time.
She's going to be great.


386
00:26:30.905 --> 00:26:35.109
The tall-tales get more and
more outlandish every moment.


387
00:26:35.141 --> 00:26:38.111
Laugh it up. We'll see who has
the laughing last when I'm


388
00:26:38.144 --> 00:26:41.148
living off the proverbial grid
and you two are living on...


389
00:26:41.181 --> 00:26:44.384
the grid... Proverbially.

390
00:26:44.418 --> 00:26:46.987
Be sure to do whatever it is I'm
supposed to do with


391
00:26:47.021 --> 00:26:50.158
those reports. And don't
worry, Marcus. Those


392
00:26:50.190 --> 00:27:00.190
kids will turn up... See ya!

393
00:27:01.835 --> 00:27:03.871
I'm sure there's
nothing to worry about.


394
00:27:03.903 --> 00:27:06.173
There never is.

395
00:27:09.008 --> 00:27:13.847
No, I'm serious. he gave
up his spot!. I know, right?


396
00:27:13.880 --> 00:27:17.919
Now I'm stuck there until who
knows when, No one to talk to!


397
00:27:17.951 --> 00:27:18.952
Sounds like she's
stuck hanging out with


398
00:27:18.986 --> 00:27:20.787
some real losers tonight.

399
00:27:20.821 --> 00:27:22.022
She's just dramatic.

400
00:27:22.055 --> 00:27:27.894
Shakespeare is dramatic.
Chase is just... loud.


401
00:27:27.928 --> 00:27:30.231
Because he is
a silly, silly boy.


402
00:27:30.264 --> 00:27:32.533
She's always been loud.

403
00:27:32.565 --> 00:27:34.134
I didn't know you
guys were friends.


404
00:27:35.069 --> 00:27:40.274
What? Well. We aren't.
Anymore.


405
00:27:40.306 --> 00:27:42.075
What happened?

406
00:27:42.109 --> 00:27:46.047
High school.

407
00:27:46.080 --> 00:27:47.782
You sure you're
bringing enough books?


408
00:27:47.814 --> 00:27:49.516
Just figured I'd get
some studying knocked out.


409
00:27:49.550 --> 00:27:54.255
Gonna be a long night.
Not bringing anything?


410
00:27:54.287 --> 00:27:56.356
Just my sense of adventure.

411
00:27:58.525 --> 00:28:02.295
Hey, Crystal... you're a girl...

412
00:28:02.329 --> 00:28:04.298
Look who paid
attention in sex ed...


413
00:28:04.331 --> 00:28:08.502
What's the best present
a guy ever gave you?


414
00:28:08.534 --> 00:28:12.239
That's easy, actually.
Last year, when I was on


415
00:28:12.273 --> 00:28:14.942
paper staff, I got this.

416
00:28:14.975 --> 00:28:16.177
A pen?

417
00:28:16.209 --> 00:28:19.546
It's a really nice pen!

418
00:28:19.580 --> 00:28:23.251
Romantic... wait, did you
get this from Mr. Neiman?


419
00:28:23.284 --> 00:28:25.820
The english teacher?!
You and him...


420
00:28:25.852 --> 00:28:31.825
What? No! God Donny, thats
disgusting. He's a teacher.


421
00:28:31.859 --> 00:28:32.894
You asked me what
the best present


422
00:28:32.927 --> 00:28:34.528
I ever got from
a guy was. And this is it.


423
00:28:34.561 --> 00:28:40.534
Okay, okay, I'm sorry.
It's a nice pen.


424
00:28:40.566 --> 00:28:42.202
It's useful!

425
00:28:47.440 --> 00:28:50.076
So what'd you
get for Chase?


426
00:28:50.110 --> 00:28:53.147
What? Nothing. I was just...
making conversation.


427
00:28:53.179 --> 00:28:55.048
Really? 'Cus you know If you
want, I can ask again louder!


428
00:28:55.082 --> 00:28:57.552
Okay! Jeez! Just
keep it down, all right?


429
00:29:03.990 --> 00:29:06.192
It's real silver.

430
00:29:06.226 --> 00:29:08.462
Nice?

431
00:29:08.495 --> 00:29:12.065
Sure it's not for you?

432
00:29:12.099 --> 00:29:15.937
It's meant to represent
my name. So that, I'll always


433
00:29:15.969 --> 00:29:17.137
be close to
her heart. And her...


434
00:29:17.170 --> 00:29:20.207
No! That's not egocentric
at all...


435
00:29:20.239 --> 00:29:21.875
The jewelry store was
out of "C"s! I was in a rush!


436
00:29:21.909 --> 00:29:23.210
I panicked.

437
00:29:23.244 --> 00:29:24.611
Panic and egotism? You
know that's the one-two punch


438
00:29:24.644 --> 00:29:26.446
to make a girl
all weak in the knees.


439
00:29:30.516 --> 00:29:31.952
I like it.

440
00:29:34.521 --> 00:29:37.025
All right, prisoners. Fall in!

441
00:30:27.341 --> 00:30:31.312
Here we are, kids, the oldest
standing jail in the state.


442
00:30:31.344 --> 00:30:35.015
Closed for decades, recently
refurbished, and graciously on


443
00:30:35.048 --> 00:30:37.584
loan for all our
fund-raising needs.


444
00:30:37.618 --> 00:30:40.487
You know that's the problem
with traditional fund-raisers


445
00:30:40.521 --> 00:30:43.257
Not creepy enough.

446
00:30:45.426 --> 00:30:47.328
There's your creepy.

447
00:30:49.295 --> 00:30:51.765
Excellent.

448
00:30:53.667 --> 00:30:55.369
Seriously? There
are still places we


449
00:30:55.401 --> 00:30:57.071
can't get bars on our
cells?!


450
00:30:57.103 --> 00:30:59.973
Don't worry, Chase. You'll
have plenty of "cell-bars"


451
00:31:00.006 --> 00:31:04.144
tonight. If you follow my...
You know the cells...


452
00:31:04.178 --> 00:31:08.582
with the... bars?
Right... so. The Marion


453
00:31:08.614 --> 00:31:12.752
Country Jail house. Built
around the turn of the


454
00:31:12.785 --> 00:31:15.622
century it was originally
intended as a small


455
00:31:15.656 --> 00:31:18.492
slaughterhouse for pigs
and chickens,


456
00:31:18.525 --> 00:31:21.094
but the livestock proved
difficult to protect from


457
00:31:21.128 --> 00:31:28.702
local predators. Thankfully the
design converted easily to...


458
00:31:28.735 --> 00:31:36.110
Right, history's boring. I'll follow
you guys into the-yeah, good.


459
00:31:54.428 --> 00:31:58.498
And this would be the
"minimum security" wing?


460
00:31:58.532 --> 00:32:02.570
This is the "house" part. Jails
used to be owned and run by


461
00:32:02.602 --> 00:32:06.739
regular families. Like a
bed and breakfast. With bars.


462
00:32:06.773 --> 00:32:09.677
That's right. Hence the term
"jail house" or "big house."


463
00:32:09.709 --> 00:32:11.778
Hurry. we gotta get
you kids locked up so


464
00:32:11.812 --> 00:32:13.481
we can keep things moving...

465
00:32:48.814 --> 00:32:50.884
You can't be serious...

466
00:33:07.501 --> 00:33:09.503
I'd rather sleep
in the creepy forest.


467
00:33:09.535 --> 00:33:16.177
Feel free. See, this is
why I wanted to do a car wash.


468
00:33:16.209 --> 00:33:19.145
In the middle of winter.
Brilliant.


469
00:33:20.714 --> 00:33:26.553
So, each of these cells
has its own "special charm."


470
00:33:27.821 --> 00:33:33.561
So we're not going to
have... y'know, cell mates?


471
00:33:33.593 --> 00:33:36.663
No, lucky for you kids,
there are exactly three fully


472
00:33:36.697 --> 00:33:40.200
refurbished... well, partially
refurbished...


473
00:33:40.234 --> 00:33:42.236
well three usable cells.

474
00:33:46.640 --> 00:33:55.416
Donny, you get the 'deluxe'
cell... Indoor plumbing!


475
00:33:55.716 --> 00:33:59.652
Don't get excited. I'm not sure
that it works.


476
00:33:59.686 --> 00:34:01.188
I'll try to contain myself.

477
00:34:01.220 --> 00:34:07.928
Please do. And you, Chase...

478
00:34:07.960 --> 00:34:10.597
What's with the caution tape?

479
00:34:10.631 --> 00:34:14.535
Right, well. This cell never did
get any indoor plumbing, so some


480
00:34:14.568 --> 00:34:19.607
of the floorboards are a little
rotten due to... water damage.


481
00:34:19.639 --> 00:34:23.309
Water...? Hell no.

482
00:34:23.343 --> 00:34:23.944
Is that a rat?

483
00:34:23.977 --> 00:34:25.479
My God where?!

484
00:34:26.912 --> 00:34:29.882
Don't worry, they'll
stay out of your cell...


485
00:34:29.916 --> 00:34:32.519
I think the smell
bothers them.


486
00:34:32.552 --> 00:34:36.691
Frickin car wash
was a better idea...


487
00:34:40.427 --> 00:34:43.264
Now, Crystal...
you get the vintage cell!


488
00:34:43.296 --> 00:34:44.430
Vintage?

489
00:34:44.463 --> 00:34:46.499
No renovations, no damage...

490
00:34:47.867 --> 00:34:49.636
They wanted to
preserve the death cell


491
00:34:49.669 --> 00:34:51.372
just as it's always been.

492
00:34:53.939 --> 00:34:55.575
Death cell?

493
00:35:15.394 --> 00:35:16.963
Did you lose
something Mr. Howell?


494
00:35:16.997 --> 00:35:20.434
No I just thought
I had three locks on me.


495
00:35:20.467 --> 00:35:22.869
I'll be right back.

496
00:35:36.048 --> 00:35:38.686
Aren't you supposed
to be chaperoning us?


497
00:35:38.718 --> 00:35:41.954
Right, well. I'll be back in
a moment, in the meanwhile,


498
00:35:41.988 --> 00:35:44.625
don't destroy any public
property, touch anyone of the


499
00:35:44.657 --> 00:35:46.893
opposite sex, or die.

500
00:35:52.631 --> 00:35:54.401
Well, there go my best options.

501
00:35:57.403 --> 00:35:59.505
Don't worry, Donny.
If you want to go and die,


502
00:35:59.539 --> 00:36:01.275
I promise not to tell.

503
00:36:01.307 --> 00:36:03.343
Yeah, You'd just go grab
the first rich, stupidly good...


504
00:36:03.376 --> 00:36:05.044
looking point guard you could
find to take my place.


505
00:36:05.077 --> 00:36:07.780
Please, Donny.
That's not what happened...


506
00:36:07.814 --> 00:36:09.516
So he wasn't the first...

507
00:36:09.548 --> 00:36:12.352
My gosh... do you
guys really insist on


508
00:36:12.385 --> 00:36:14.521
re-hashing the entire
tortured relationship...


509
00:36:14.553 --> 00:36:17.490
Relationship? We
only dated for two weeks!


510
00:36:17.523 --> 00:36:18.891
18 days!

511
00:36:18.925 --> 00:36:21.861
And I wouldn't call it "dating."
To go on dates, you need a car!


512
00:36:21.894 --> 00:36:25.698
Why does it always come back to
the car, you know I can't drive.


513
00:36:25.731 --> 00:36:28.302
Yes, Donny, I'm well aware
of that fact, and believe it or


514
00:36:28.334 --> 00:36:30.470
not, I don't like it when your
mother chaperones us...


515
00:36:30.503 --> 00:36:31.971
My mother is a nice lady!

516
00:36:32.005 --> 00:36:34.073
I agree, she's very
nice... but that doesn't mean


517
00:36:34.106 --> 00:36:37.477
I want her to go take us to see
like puppet shows or something.


518
00:36:37.510 --> 00:36:39.545
Puppet shows? Is that
what we did in our spare time?


519
00:36:39.579 --> 00:36:40.647
Watch puppet shows?

520
00:36:40.680 --> 00:36:42.082
Yes, I actually
recall her taking us to a


521
00:36:42.115 --> 00:36:44.351
Children's Library one time,
and it was the worst date


522
00:36:44.383 --> 00:36:45.418
I have ever been on.

523
00:36:45.452 --> 00:36:47.787
Okay, I get that.
I get that.


524
00:36:47.820 --> 00:36:48.988
Yeah, I know you thought
it was like romantic and like


525
00:36:49.021 --> 00:36:52.992
nostalgic, but that's not really
want girls want. Surprise!


526
00:36:53.026 --> 00:36:54.995
Well I thought, maybe,
hey "The Three Little Pigs."


527
00:36:55.028 --> 00:36:57.097
I said that could be her
favorite book.


528
00:36:57.130 --> 00:37:00.968
Right! Right,
SO unromantic, Donny.


529
00:37:01.001 --> 00:37:02.602
You going to let me talk for
a second? You gonna let me talk?


530
00:37:02.635 --> 00:37:03.836
Useful gift.

531
00:37:03.871 --> 00:37:05.805
I was thinking that hey, maybe
you could relate to one of those


532
00:37:05.838 --> 00:37:07.106
little pigs because
they were friendly.


533
00:37:07.140 --> 00:37:09.742
Well I was thinking that
maybe you think of me as a pig.


534
00:37:09.776 --> 00:37:12.379
Okay, because that's what goes
through a girl's mind when you


535
00:37:12.412 --> 00:37:14.348
bring her to go see the three
little pigs with your mother!


536
00:37:14.381 --> 00:37:16.850
Ok so then what, you
just find someone who can


537
00:37:16.883 --> 00:37:18.452
take you on his own time?

538
00:37:18.485 --> 00:37:19.986
Look Donny, I need someone
who can take care of me,


539
00:37:20.019 --> 00:37:21.487
you clearly, can not
do that.


540
00:37:21.521 --> 00:37:24.457
You get together with
Marty freakin' Marshall, then?


541
00:37:24.490 --> 00:37:27.628
Donny, if you mention that
one more time, I swear to God


542
00:37:27.660 --> 00:37:29.128
I'm going to scream...

543
00:37:42.476 --> 00:37:43.778
What's happening?

544
00:37:43.811 --> 00:37:48.414
I don't know... part of the
show? Trying to scare us...?


545
00:37:48.447 --> 00:37:52.819
No no way... he wouldn't...

546
00:37:52.852 --> 00:37:53.988
Chase? Are you okay?

547
00:37:54.021 --> 00:37:57.890
This isn't funny! I
want out of here right now!


548
00:37:57.923 --> 00:37:59.159
Stay calm...
I'm sure it's just...


549
00:38:02.963 --> 00:38:04.965
What was that?!

550
00:38:14.073 --> 00:38:19.746
Mr. Howell? Is that you?

551
00:38:20.881 --> 00:38:22.683
I think he's hurt...

552
00:38:23.782 --> 00:38:30.657
Mr. Howell?
Are you hurt?


553
00:38:32.659 --> 00:38:35.496
Crystal you need
to go check on him


554
00:38:35.528 --> 00:38:37.463
Crystal, he could be really
hurt! You're the only


555
00:38:37.497 --> 00:38:38.131
one who could help him.

556
00:38:38.164 --> 00:38:42.969
Okay. I know...

557
00:39:16.269 --> 00:39:18.772
What is going on?

558
00:39:24.110 --> 00:39:28.749
Chase! What is it?

559
00:39:39.092 --> 00:39:43.664
My door's not locked.
My door's not locked!


560
00:39:43.697 --> 00:39:48.834
Chase! You have to help
her! Chase Can you help her?!


561
00:39:48.867 --> 00:39:50.737
Help me!

562
00:39:54.039 --> 00:39:55.141
Crystal!

563
00:40:13.126 --> 00:40:15.595
No, no, no!

564
00:40:29.309 --> 00:40:31.678
Crystal!

565
00:41:17.890 --> 00:41:19.860
Chase!

566
00:41:33.773 --> 00:41:35.776
Come on!

567
00:41:52.392 --> 00:41:54.061
Death cell...

568
00:41:54.360 --> 00:41:56.030
Crystal!

569
00:42:17.282 --> 00:42:18.918
Donny!

570
00:42:18.952 --> 00:42:21.655
Guys? Is that you?

571
00:42:22.789 --> 00:42:23.622
Crystal?

572
00:42:23.657 --> 00:42:25.659
Yeah... I got Chase, too...

573
00:42:25.691 --> 00:42:28.195
How?

574
00:42:28.227 --> 00:42:30.697
Capital punishment and
drunken prisoners with no


575
00:42:30.729 --> 00:42:32.733
bladder control!

576
00:42:32.765 --> 00:42:34.800
Right, can we get out?

577
00:42:34.834 --> 00:42:36.002
It looks like it.

578
00:42:36.035 --> 00:42:38.338
Great.

579
00:42:45.878 --> 00:42:46.979
Get me out of here?

580
00:42:47.014 --> 00:42:55.088
Yeah. Yeah, ok.
Stand back... Chase.


581
00:42:58.490 --> 00:43:01.460
Be careful.

582
00:43:01.494 --> 00:43:04.164
Take your time.

583
00:43:06.298 --> 00:43:08.968
But, you know... hurry.

584
00:43:11.436 --> 00:43:13.239
Damn it...

585
00:43:14.139 --> 00:43:17.410
I think they
renovated too well...


586
00:43:18.410 --> 00:43:22.416
So... I'm stuck in here,

587
00:43:23.015 --> 00:43:27.887
-Can you see it?
-Is it still here?


588
00:43:32.057 --> 00:43:42.034
It has to be... Either of
you have a signal on your phone?


589
00:43:42.068 --> 00:43:43.771
Hold on...

590
00:43:47.907 --> 00:43:49.543
No...

591
00:43:51.211 --> 00:43:52.779
What?

592
00:43:52.811 --> 00:43:53.947
Check your phone.

593
00:43:53.979 --> 00:43:55.081
I didn't bring a phone.

594
00:43:55.113 --> 00:43:57.983
You didn't bring a phone?

595
00:43:58.017 --> 00:43:59.085
I didn't think I would need one.

596
00:43:59.117 --> 00:44:00.286
You seriously
didn't bring a phone?


597
00:44:00.320 --> 00:44:01.488
Come on I didn't
think we were gonna be


598
00:44:01.521 --> 00:44:02.889
eaten tonight!

599
00:44:02.923 --> 00:44:05.959
All right, well... there has to
be a phone in the house, right?


600
00:44:05.992 --> 00:44:07.394
Is there a way out
of where you are?


601
00:44:07.427 --> 00:44:11.298
Yeah... But what if
that thing is still out there?


602
00:44:11.331 --> 00:44:13.800
No way we go out there.
Just...


603
00:44:13.832 --> 00:44:17.436
we'll just wait here.
Mr. Howell will go get


604
00:44:17.470 --> 00:44:21.073
help. I mean, He wouldn't
just leave us here.


605
00:44:21.106 --> 00:44:22.842
What if he can't help us?

606
00:44:22.876 --> 00:44:24.544
What do you mean?

607
00:44:24.577 --> 00:44:26.780
You heard him
screaming, Chase.


608
00:44:26.813 --> 00:44:30.082
So... we heard you
screaming too and you got away,


609
00:44:30.115 --> 00:44:32.017
maybe he got away.

610
00:44:32.050 --> 00:44:35.287
Yeah. Maybe.

611
00:44:35.320 --> 00:44:38.157
Chase is right.
Maybe he went for help.


612
00:44:38.191 --> 00:44:40.127
We'll just have to
wait for...


613
00:44:44.229 --> 00:44:45.398
what is that?

614
00:44:47.332 --> 00:44:48.869
What is what?

615
00:44:48.901 --> 00:44:49.903
Cameras.

616
00:44:52.104 --> 00:44:53.305
Cameras?

617
00:44:53.338 --> 00:44:54.573
A bunch of them. Like,

618
00:44:54.606 --> 00:44:57.177
surveillance cameras or
something.


619
00:45:00.113 --> 00:45:03.082
There's one in my cell, too.

620
00:45:03.115 --> 00:45:04.550
Maybe...

621
00:45:04.584 --> 00:45:06.319
Maybe this is
one of those shows...


622
00:45:06.352 --> 00:45:09.589
where they scare people
as a prank!


623
00:45:09.622 --> 00:45:12.425
My God!

624
00:45:12.457 --> 00:45:13.827
If you were in on this,

625
00:45:13.860 --> 00:45:16.162
I swear I
will never forgive you ever!


626
00:45:19.064 --> 00:45:20.467
Stop being nuts.

627
00:45:20.499 --> 00:45:22.869
If it's a security camera,
maybe someone is watching us.


628
00:45:22.901 --> 00:45:31.110
Hello! Hey! Hello! Hey! Help us!
Can you see me!? Hello?


629
00:45:31.144 --> 00:45:35.082
Hello can you see us? Hello?

630
00:45:36.381 --> 00:45:39.151
Run for the door!

631
00:45:39.184 --> 00:45:40.186
Come on!

632
00:46:02.608 --> 00:46:06.947
Ready? Go!

633
00:46:40.246 --> 00:46:41.548
Open the door!

634
00:46:41.581 --> 00:46:42.314
We're trying...

635
00:46:42.347 --> 00:46:43.382
Help us!

636
00:47:41.173 --> 00:47:44.276
What. The Hell. Was that?

637
00:47:44.309 --> 00:47:46.378
I don't know. Bear?
Escaped gorilla from the zoo?


638
00:47:46.412 --> 00:47:47.280
You know that's not it.

639
00:47:47.313 --> 00:47:48.381
I know, but you gotta say those

640
00:47:48.414 --> 00:47:52.386
things. When you say "monster",
you just sound crazy.


641
00:47:53.352 --> 00:47:54.654
Be careful!

642
00:47:54.686 --> 00:47:58.357
Relax. I'm just taking a peek.
Maybe we can find a way to...


643
00:48:02.628 --> 00:48:04.698
signal for help...

644
00:48:05.731 --> 00:48:07.534
What kind of room
is this? And What is that?


645
00:48:11.704 --> 00:48:13.539
Is it a phone?

646
00:48:13.572 --> 00:48:16.442
Some kind of... security room?

647
00:48:16.476 --> 00:48:18.077
It is a jail. Makes sense.

648
00:48:18.110 --> 00:48:20.246
It doesn't make any
sense. It's not a working jail...


649
00:48:20.278 --> 00:48:22.148
Who cares? See
if it has facebook.


650
00:48:22.180 --> 00:48:25.050
Right, maybe we can
update our status to "help".


651
00:48:25.084 --> 00:48:29.122
Right! How do you close this...

652
00:48:29.155 --> 00:48:32.092
God, I don't care! Just get
on facebook, you piece of...


653
00:48:33.159 --> 00:48:35.128
That's right
outside the door.


654
00:48:37.497 --> 00:48:40.600
Damn it, stop! Go away!

655
00:48:40.633 --> 00:48:42.635
I'd really rather
come in there. Please.


656
00:48:42.668 --> 00:48:44.704
Mr. Howell!

657
00:48:44.736 --> 00:48:47.039
Quickly!

658
00:48:47.072 --> 00:48:50.509
Hold on... it's
like Fort Knox in here...


659
00:48:50.543 --> 00:48:52.711
Careful...

660
00:48:52.744 --> 00:48:54.713
My God, are you okay?

661
00:48:54.747 --> 00:48:59.385
Yes... yes, I'm fine.
God, you should all still


662
00:48:59.418 --> 00:49:01.488
be in your
cells. This is all wrong...


663
00:49:01.521 --> 00:49:03.055
We thought you were dead!

664
00:49:03.088 --> 00:49:07.392
Yes. So did I. But
I'm fine. And you're all fine.


665
00:49:07.425 --> 00:49:09.628
So as long as we all just
stay calm.


666
00:49:09.662 --> 00:49:12.332
We should be safe in here.

667
00:49:12.365 --> 00:49:13.633
What was that out there?

668
00:49:13.666 --> 00:49:15.669
I'll be happy
to show you Donny, I...


669
00:49:16.769 --> 00:49:19.606
Did any of you
touch this computer?


670
00:49:19.639 --> 00:49:22.342
We were going
to try to get help...


671
00:49:22.374 --> 00:49:24.543
You didn't click
anything? Didn't close anything?


672
00:49:24.577 --> 00:49:27.380
We tried to get on facebook...

673
00:49:27.412 --> 00:49:28.481
No, no, no, no...

674
00:49:28.514 --> 00:49:32.218
What did you do? What did you

675
00:49:32.251 --> 00:49:34.187
exactly do?

676
00:49:34.220 --> 00:49:35.755
Nothing! I closed the program...

677
00:49:35.787 --> 00:49:36.588
Did you save it?

678
00:49:36.622 --> 00:49:37.223
I don't know! I...

679
00:49:37.256 --> 00:49:40.460
No! Dammit!

680
00:49:40.492 --> 00:49:41.427
This is going to sound crazy,

681
00:49:41.459 --> 00:49:42.662
but I don't think we should be
in here.


682
00:49:42.695 --> 00:49:45.265
You'd rather be out
there with that thing?


683
00:49:45.298 --> 00:49:47.433
I don't think
it's out there anymore.


684
00:49:47.465 --> 00:49:49.535
Mr. Howell disappears.
That thing shows up.


685
00:49:49.568 --> 00:49:51.470
Ok that thing disappears,
Mr. Howell shows up.


686
00:49:51.503 --> 00:49:52.538
That doesn't mean anything!

687
00:49:52.572 --> 00:49:53.539
Just hear me out...

688
00:49:53.572 --> 00:49:55.507
Back up not found!

689
00:49:55.541 --> 00:49:58.343
You are in a beautiful
scenic shopping mall.


690
00:49:58.376 --> 00:50:00.479
It's a full moon, that
thing let me go because


691
00:50:00.512 --> 00:50:02.614
I stabbed its hand
with silver...


692
00:50:02.648 --> 00:50:07.720
Will you kids please
just shut up for one second!


693
00:50:07.753 --> 00:50:10.557
No, it's ok, I can
fix this, I can fix this.


694
00:50:10.590 --> 00:50:12.392
Mr. Howell, what
happened to your hand?


695
00:50:12.425 --> 00:50:15.662
What? Slammed
it in door of the car.


696
00:50:15.695 --> 00:50:17.162
The car?

697
00:50:17.195 --> 00:50:20.265
Yes. The car. The beast
attacked me I hid in the car.


698
00:50:20.298 --> 00:50:22.467
I popped in the back seat
I hid in the trunk.


699
00:50:22.501 --> 00:50:23.468
What do you doing?

700
00:50:23.501 --> 00:50:25.337
Go!

701
00:50:25.371 --> 00:50:27.840
Wait! Wait, Wait!

702
00:50:29.175 --> 00:50:30.577
You'll ruin everything!

703
00:50:34.780 --> 00:50:37.784
Go, go, go!. Go, go!

704
00:50:53.666 --> 00:50:55.202
Wait for me!

705
00:51:13.885 --> 00:51:17.590
Wait! Someone tell me
why we are in the woods?!


706
00:51:17.622 --> 00:51:20.193
Chase... stop and think about
what is going on for a second.


707
00:51:20.226 --> 00:51:21.593
I have no idea what's going on!

708
00:51:21.626 --> 00:51:22.527
Chase...

709
00:51:22.561 --> 00:51:23.329
Don't slap me!

710
00:51:23.361 --> 00:51:24.463
Then stop freaking out!

711
00:51:24.497 --> 00:51:25.799
I'm not freaking out...

712
00:51:25.831 --> 00:51:28.233
You are totally freaking out...
just like at your fourth


713
00:51:28.267 --> 00:51:29.636
grade birthday party,
when your parents had the


714
00:51:29.668 --> 00:51:30.502
guy in the mouse suit...

715
00:51:30.537 --> 00:51:31.704
Shut up about the mouse suit!

716
00:51:31.736 --> 00:51:34.539
Guys! Focus! Silver,
full moon, big, hairy.


717
00:51:34.572 --> 00:51:36.642
We're talking about
a werewolf here.


718
00:51:36.675 --> 00:51:39.311
Not helping with
the freaking out!


719
00:51:39.345 --> 00:51:43.816
Look, if we admit we're dealing
with a werewolf, we can make a


720
00:51:43.849 --> 00:51:47.419
plan! Now, what do we know about
werewolves?


721
00:51:47.452 --> 00:51:50.422
Ok right, also known
as a lycanthrope, or


722
00:51:50.456 --> 00:51:52.925
loup-garou in French.
Primarily appears in


723
00:51:52.957 --> 00:51:54.793
European folklore,
but sometimes in Greek


724
00:51:54.827 --> 00:51:57.729
mythology, the story of Lycan,
who I believe


725
00:51:57.762 --> 00:51:59.931
turned into a wolf
as a result of


726
00:51:59.965 --> 00:52:03.937
eating human flesh.

727
00:52:05.338 --> 00:52:08.041
I could be a little
fuzzy on that point.


728
00:52:08.640 --> 00:52:11.376
Why would anyone know
so much useless information?


729
00:52:11.410 --> 00:52:13.780
Not all of us can get by
on a C-average and the ability


730
00:52:13.813 --> 00:52:15.981
to stack ourselves into a human
pyramid every night.


731
00:52:16.014 --> 00:52:18.350
Some of us have to read.

732
00:52:18.383 --> 00:52:19.952
You know, I got an A in physics.

733
00:52:19.985 --> 00:52:21.354
Your mom's the physics teacher!

734
00:52:21.387 --> 00:52:22.889
She doesn't give
me special treatment.


735
00:52:22.921 --> 00:52:27.492
Okay, stop. Werewolves. Only
a few things can hurt it, right?


736
00:52:27.526 --> 00:52:35.468
Right. Like silver bullets.
Silver-silver can hurt it.


737
00:52:35.501 --> 00:52:38.271
Do we have any silver?

738
00:52:38.303 --> 00:52:41.407
Only a little...
What else?


739
00:52:41.439 --> 00:52:44.744
I don't know... fire maybe?

740
00:52:44.776 --> 00:52:47.646
Start a forest fire.
Great idea.


741
00:52:47.680 --> 00:52:49.015
Should we gather dry
twigs? Because


742
00:52:49.048 --> 00:52:50.816
I think I saw some over there
by the other completely


743
00:52:50.849 --> 00:52:52.384
useless information you are
giving us.


744
00:52:52.418 --> 00:52:54.954
Look, the moon is covered.
So all we have to do is


745
00:52:54.986 --> 00:52:55.988
wait it out 'til morning.

746
00:52:56.021 --> 00:52:57.689
I'm not sure about this plan...

747
00:52:57.722 --> 00:53:01.427
Do you guys hear that?

748
00:53:01.459 --> 00:53:06.733
God, is it Mr. Howell?

749
00:53:06.765 --> 00:53:10.035
I think it's... 
Jimmy Buffett?

750
00:53:10.068 --> 00:53:12.537
It's pronounced "buffet."

751
00:53:12.570 --> 00:53:14.373
I don't think anyone's
ever been eaten alive


752
00:53:14.407 --> 00:53:16.008
while listening to
Jimmy Buffett.


753
00:53:16.041 --> 00:53:20.580
"Buffet." You sound like a
moron when you say it like that.


754
00:53:26.117 --> 00:53:27.320
Should we knock?

755
00:53:27.352 --> 00:53:28.387
I don't know. We have no...

756
00:53:28.421 --> 00:53:30.990
Hello? Hey! Hello?

757
00:53:31.023 --> 00:53:32.791
Guess we're knocking.

758
00:53:32.825 --> 00:53:35.861
Children in peril out here!

759
00:53:35.894 --> 00:53:36.762
Hey!

760
00:53:36.796 --> 00:53:37.697
I don't think anyone's in there.

761
00:53:37.729 --> 00:53:39.064
Anyone alive, at least.

762
00:53:39.097 --> 00:53:42.701
Why do you feel the need
to keep saying things like that?


763
00:53:45.137 --> 00:53:48.608
Hey. Let's check
the truck, ok? Maybe


764
00:53:48.640 --> 00:53:49.709
we can just get the
hell out of here.


765
00:53:50.675 --> 00:53:52.378
I'd have listened to
the girl. That would've


766
00:53:52.410 --> 00:53:54.713
just been vandalism. Now
Grand Theft Auto?


767
00:53:54.747 --> 00:53:56.482
That's serious.

768
00:53:56.514 --> 00:53:58.550
'Specially if it's
the Sheriff's truck.


769
00:53:58.584 --> 00:53:59.819
Thank God...

770
00:53:59.852 --> 00:54:01.421
Sorry I couldn't
answer the door,


771
00:54:01.454 --> 00:54:04.524
plumbing doesnt work if
you catch my drift.


772
00:54:04.557 --> 00:54:06.058
Sheriff! We think
someone's chasing us...


773
00:54:06.090 --> 00:54:08.560
Hold on son... What
happened to your hand?


774
00:54:08.593 --> 00:54:10.061
Our teacher tried to eat us...

775
00:54:10.095 --> 00:54:13.032
Warn us that an
animal might eat us...


776
00:54:13.064 --> 00:54:13.698
And it did.

777
00:54:13.733 --> 00:54:15.034
Well, it tried.

778
00:54:20.706 --> 00:54:25.445
Well then, let's not stand
around out here like a buffet.


779
00:54:25.477 --> 00:54:28.881
Let's get you kids someplace
safe, ok?


780
00:54:30.515 --> 00:54:33.485
"Safe" like, "inside" maybe?

781
00:54:33.519 --> 00:54:34.986
You wouldn't like
it in there. First,


782
00:54:35.019 --> 00:54:41.059
no plumbing,
second, no back wall.


783
00:54:41.093 --> 00:54:43.863
I just gotta grab my stuff, and
we can head into town.


784
00:54:44.563 --> 00:54:46.164
We don't have time for this!

785
00:54:46.197 --> 00:54:48.800
Can't leave this lying
out in the woods with you kids


786
00:54:48.834 --> 00:54:51.102
running around, anybody else
out here with you tonight?


787
00:54:51.135 --> 00:54:53.773
Just our teacher. But
he's... back at the jail.


788
00:54:53.805 --> 00:54:54.673
Hopefully.

789
00:54:54.706 --> 00:54:56.441
What You were
the lock-in kids?


790
00:54:56.474 --> 00:54:58.477
Unfortunately...

791
00:54:58.510 --> 00:55:00.045
Well good for you,
gettin' outta early.


792
00:55:00.079 --> 00:55:02.682
I wouldn't want to
run into Alexander Drake.


793
00:55:03.715 --> 00:55:05.183
Who?

794
00:55:05.217 --> 00:55:09.122
Alexander Drake? Y'know,
the ghost that haunts...


795
00:55:11.490 --> 00:55:15.127
don't you kids appreciate a
good campfire story anymore?


796
00:55:15.160 --> 00:55:18.030
Alexander Drake's the reason
that jail's closed.


797
00:55:18.063 --> 00:55:19.631
Back when that was a
working jail,


798
00:55:19.664 --> 00:55:21.800
town was still pretty sleepy.

799
00:55:21.834 --> 00:55:25.137
Not really any crime, just
drunk and disorderly cases


800
00:55:25.169 --> 00:55:29.575
mostly. no one ever really
dangerous. Not until old


801
00:55:29.608 --> 00:55:32.077
Alexander Drake. He was linked
to a string of murders


802
00:55:32.110 --> 00:55:37.682
all across the state. Old
Drake, he was a biter.


803
00:55:37.715 --> 00:55:39.718
Jailor's kid
nearly lost his finger


804
00:55:39.751 --> 00:55:42.588
trying to pass him
his dinner. Gimme a sec.


805
00:55:43.988 --> 00:55:47.526
Don't touch the truck.

806
00:55:50.028 --> 00:55:52.097
Marcus, are you out there
at the gin?


807
00:55:55.133 --> 00:55:57.102
So how are we
supposed to get in?


808
00:55:57.135 --> 00:55:59.237
I don't know, I
can clear the front?


809
00:55:59.271 --> 00:56:01.573
Go clear out the cabin
and we can fit in there.


810
00:56:01.606 --> 00:56:02.675
Teenagers out here
at the cabin. I'm gonna


811
00:56:02.707 --> 00:56:04.976
run 'em on into town.
Listen. Might be nothing,


812
00:56:05.010 --> 00:56:06.946
but you see any kids
out there,


813
00:56:06.979 --> 00:56:09.814
send 'em on home, okay?
Thanks.


814
00:56:09.847 --> 00:56:12.684
Hey, hey, that's stuck.
Someone's gotta


815
00:56:12.718 --> 00:56:14.553
ride in the
back...


816
00:56:14.586 --> 00:56:17.055
Anyway, Drake was
scheduled to ship off to the


817
00:56:17.088 --> 00:56:20.258
state correctional facility.

818
00:56:20.291 --> 00:56:24.029
But the morning of the
transport,


819
00:56:24.063 --> 00:56:28.166
when the police showed up,
the jailor and his whole family


820
00:56:28.200 --> 00:56:34.674
all gone. Nothing but shredded
clothes, and blood everywhere.


821
00:56:34.706 --> 00:56:41.580
All gone but the youngest boy,
who they found hunkered down


822
00:56:41.613 --> 00:56:45.818
in the hayloft under the cells.
Scared, tired, beat up.


823
00:56:45.851 --> 00:56:47.852
But still alive.
And ole, Drake...


824
00:56:47.885 --> 00:56:51.157
he was still locked
in his cell, ranting like a


825
00:56:51.189 --> 00:56:55.860
madman. Swore it was some kind
of wild animal done it.


826
00:56:55.894 --> 00:56:58.798
Well, he never made it to trial.

827
00:56:58.831 --> 00:57:01.033
They hung him right there
in his cell.


828
00:57:01.066 --> 00:57:04.037
Death Cell...

829
00:57:05.169 --> 00:57:09.675
Anyway after that, the state
closed down the jail


830
00:57:09.707 --> 00:57:12.311
and old Joshua Howell, he
got shipped off


831
00:57:12.343 --> 00:57:13.778
to the children's
home.


832
00:57:13.811 --> 00:57:15.247
Joshua Howell?

833
00:57:19.684 --> 00:57:20.885
Quiet!

834
00:57:20.919 --> 00:57:22.755
Please shoot it a lot.

835
00:57:22.787 --> 00:57:25.190
You gotta let
go of my arm first.


836
00:57:26.592 --> 00:57:28.961
Take these. Get in the
truck. Close the doors.


837
00:57:28.994 --> 00:57:30.229
What are you going to do?

838
00:57:30.262 --> 00:57:34.033
Sheriff stuff. Investigate.
Don't worry. If anything


839
00:57:34.066 --> 00:57:35.901
happens, I got this big gun.

840
00:57:37.068 --> 00:57:38.670
You have the keys, right?

841
00:57:38.704 --> 00:57:40.171
I don't know how to drive!
Do we have to keep


842
00:57:40.204 --> 00:57:41.139
bringing this up?

843
00:57:41.173 --> 00:57:43.209
Give me the damn keys...

844
00:57:49.347 --> 00:57:53.985
This is the Sheriff. If you're
a hunter or a hiker with an


845
00:57:54.019 --> 00:57:56.856
injury, shout...
so I can find you.


846
00:58:00.758 --> 00:58:03.028
You should... get in the front.

847
00:58:03.061 --> 00:58:05.697
No thats fine, I
can ride in the back.


848
00:58:05.731 --> 00:58:08.267
No, no, I'm, ok here.

849
00:58:12.637 --> 00:58:16.241
If you're a psychopath
with a chainsaw... in need of a


850
00:58:16.275 --> 00:58:25.284
shooting... the shouting
thing still stands.


851
00:58:25.316 --> 00:58:27.653
Maybe we can both fit... yeah...

852
00:58:29.088 --> 00:58:30.289
Get in, get in.

853
00:58:32.124 --> 00:58:33.359
What are you doing?

854
00:58:33.392 --> 00:58:35.194
I'm going to
check on the sheriff.


855
00:58:37.963 --> 00:58:39.631
Do you see anything?

856
00:58:39.664 --> 00:58:40.465
No.

857
00:58:41.800 --> 00:58:44.102
Go go go go go!

858
00:58:45.336 --> 00:58:46.905
Why aren't we going?

859
00:58:46.939 --> 00:58:48.007
I don't know how to drive stick!

860
00:58:48.039 --> 00:58:49.207
Are you serious?

861
00:58:49.240 --> 00:58:51.309
You don't get to make fun of me!

862
00:58:51.343 --> 00:58:54.280
Go go go go go!

863
00:58:55.981 --> 00:58:57.249
Why aren't we moving?

864
00:58:57.282 --> 00:58:58.918
She doesn't know
how to drive stick!


865
00:58:58.950 --> 00:59:00.753
What kind of
teenager can't drive?


866
00:59:00.785 --> 00:59:02.021
I know, it's nuts, right?

867
00:59:02.053 --> 00:59:03.689
Shut up!

868
00:59:08.093 --> 00:59:09.262
Woah!

869
00:59:13.131 --> 00:59:14.867
Shift up! Shift up!

870
00:59:14.900 --> 00:59:16.769
I don't know how!

871
00:59:23.041 --> 00:59:24.110
Slam on the breaks!

872
00:59:24.142 --> 00:59:25.278
What?

873
00:59:29.314 --> 00:59:30.483
Do it!

874
01:00:10.756 --> 01:00:12.058
What are you doing?

875
01:00:16.994 --> 01:00:19.064
Buying you some time.

876
01:00:22.334 --> 01:00:24.904
Now no matter what you see
or what you hear,


877
01:00:24.936 --> 01:00:28.339
you keep going.

878
01:00:28.372 --> 01:00:30.175
We're not going to
just leave you here...


879
01:00:30.209 --> 01:00:40.209
Go no matter what! Go!
Tell campfire stories about me!


880
01:00:44.356 --> 01:00:48.294
Should we go back?

881
01:00:48.327 --> 01:00:49.294
Keep going.

882
01:01:17.555 --> 01:01:19.492
Probably not a good Idea.

883
01:01:51.889 --> 01:01:55.260
Are you freaking kidding me?
What in the name of all that's


884
01:01:55.293 --> 01:01:57.061
holy in the freaking
world is the


885
01:01:57.095 --> 01:02:01.500
freaking deal damn
freaking shit!


886
01:02:01.532 --> 01:02:03.034
No, you're right.

887
01:02:09.541 --> 01:02:14.513
Excellent! guys look!
We're by the Gin'n'Smooch!


888
01:02:14.546 --> 01:02:15.514
Yes!

889
01:02:15.546 --> 01:02:16.581
Gin and "smooch?"

890
01:02:16.615 --> 01:02:18.517
Yeah. The old Cotton Gin.

891
01:02:18.550 --> 01:02:21.352
Where kids go to park and do...
stuff.


892
01:02:21.385 --> 01:02:23.221
What kind of stuff?

893
01:02:23.255 --> 01:02:25.323
Seriously?

894
01:02:26.325 --> 01:02:27.860
Come on...

895
01:02:27.892 --> 01:02:31.863
Wait, Crystal how do you
know about the Gin & Smooch?


896
01:02:31.896 --> 01:02:33.932
Come on, does it
matter, there's people...


897
01:02:35.032 --> 01:02:38.336
Seriously... guys...
what kind of stuff?


898
01:02:42.374 --> 01:02:44.977
Thank God... come on...

899
01:02:49.414 --> 01:02:52.184
Hey... help us, please!
There's something out...


900
01:02:52.217 --> 01:02:52.952
We gotta leave now!

901
01:02:52.985 --> 01:02:54.586
here.

902
01:02:55.320 --> 01:02:56.988
What?

903
01:02:57.021 --> 01:02:59.224
My Gosh, what?

904
01:02:59.256 --> 01:03:01.927
I know
this car.


905
01:03:01.959 --> 01:03:03.494
What the hell do you
assholes think you're doing?


906
01:03:03.528 --> 01:03:05.965
Marty.

907
01:03:05.997 --> 01:03:07.599
Chase?

908
01:03:08.532 --> 01:03:11.602
Are you freaking serious,
Marty, do you have any idea


909
01:03:11.635 --> 01:03:13.338
what I have been
through tonight?!


910
01:03:13.372 --> 01:03:14.406
Baby, I told you
to call me when you got...


911
01:03:14.439 --> 01:03:15.507
Who is this tramp?

912
01:03:15.539 --> 01:03:18.409
Hi, I'm Chase, pleasure...

913
01:03:18.443 --> 01:03:20.512
Who is this tramp that you're
making out with


914
01:03:20.544 --> 01:03:24.148
with while I'm out here
being eaten?


915
01:03:24.182 --> 01:03:28.620
You brainless bastard dill hole
horny little... No!


916
01:03:28.653 --> 01:03:35.294
I swear I hate you and I hate
these woods and take me home


917
01:03:35.327 --> 01:03:41.167
right now, I'm serious,
take me home...


918
01:03:45.704 --> 01:03:48.640
Get in the stupid car!

919
01:03:58.717 --> 01:04:01.619
Hey, Donny. Crystal.

920
01:04:01.653 --> 01:04:03.088
Charity...

921
01:04:03.121 --> 01:04:13.121
Hey, Charity.

922
01:04:13.664 --> 01:04:17.003
Jesus, what the
hell did you guys do?


923
01:04:22.039 --> 01:04:24.342
Hi, there... Sorry to have to
be the annoying law enforcement


924
01:04:24.376 --> 01:04:25.377
type, but I'm afraid I'm gonna
have to ask


925
01:04:25.410 --> 01:04:26.979
you minors to stop
engaging in illicit activities


926
01:04:27.012 --> 01:04:28.414
and leave the premises
immediately.


927
01:04:28.447 --> 01:04:29.715
For your own safety,
of course.


928
01:04:29.747 --> 01:04:31.249
Ma'am, we saw the Sheriff...

929
01:04:31.282 --> 01:04:32.517
The Sheriff? What are
you talking about?


930
01:04:32.550 --> 01:04:34.419
We were at his cabin
earlier when he called you.


931
01:04:34.452 --> 01:04:35.186
Where is he now?

932
01:04:35.220 --> 01:04:36.255
We think he's dead, ma'am.

933
01:04:36.287 --> 01:04:37.655
What?

934
01:04:37.689 --> 01:04:39.224
Listen, he saved our lives...
we were being attacked by...


935
01:04:39.256 --> 01:04:40.425
Something
We think it might have...


936
01:04:40.459 --> 01:04:45.197
Shut up for a second.
Marcus to Evans, you copy?


937
01:04:46.564 --> 01:04:48.434
Marcus to Evans,
do you copy?


938
01:04:49.434 --> 01:04:51.736
That thing got him, ma'am.
Please believe us.


939
01:04:51.769 --> 01:04:53.139
Marcus to
dispatch, come in.


940
01:04:53.805 --> 01:04:55.474
Go ahead, Deputy.

941
01:04:55.506 --> 01:04:57.742
Has anyone heard
from the Sheriff?


942
01:04:57.776 --> 01:05:01.246
He's off-duty, Deputy.
Probably down at his shed.


943
01:05:01.278 --> 01:05:02.780
Alright look. Send someone
to check on him, would you?


944
01:05:02.814 --> 01:05:06.118
Alright. I need someone tell me
what is going on right now.


945
01:05:06.151 --> 01:05:07.553
Look officer, All I
know is these three come


946
01:05:07.586 --> 01:05:09.221
running up to my car,
they try to tear it up,


947
01:05:09.253 --> 01:05:10.655
like they were trying to
car-jack it or something.


948
01:05:10.689 --> 01:05:13.559
My God, really? Lie much
about everything, Marty?


949
01:05:13.592 --> 01:05:15.160
No, wait, he's right. We're

950
01:05:15.193 --> 01:05:18.162
carjackers. Yeah.
We're...


951
01:05:18.195 --> 01:05:20.565
grand theft auto! You
have to take us to jail, right


952
01:05:20.599 --> 01:05:22.668
now. The new jail!
Not the old jail!


953
01:05:22.700 --> 01:05:25.103
Yes! And Marty,
you two just park


954
01:05:25.137 --> 01:05:27.106
in the woods
and look delicious.


955
01:05:27.139 --> 01:05:28.740
Baby, I don't even
know what that means!


956
01:05:28.773 --> 01:05:31.610
Come on listen we
need to go somewhere now.


957
01:05:31.642 --> 01:05:33.678
Ok I need to know what
happened to the Sheriff.


958
01:05:33.711 --> 01:05:36.648
Ok I know it sounds crazy but
we were attacked by this-this...


959
01:05:36.680 --> 01:05:38.516
It's a werewolf.

960
01:05:38.550 --> 01:05:40.084
Werewolf.

961
01:05:40.117 --> 01:05:41.652
Yeah and if we get
in your car we could leave


962
01:05:41.686 --> 01:05:43.287
and get the hell out of here and
explain it later


963
01:05:43.320 --> 01:05:44.589
Look, if you guys
have been drinking...


964
01:05:44.622 --> 01:05:46.390
We need to get
into the gin right now.


965
01:05:46.423 --> 01:05:48.259
What?

966
01:05:48.293 --> 01:05:49.561
You guys been drinking gin?

967
01:05:49.593 --> 01:05:52.798
No no no, the cotton gin.
We need to get in the gin


968
01:05:52.831 --> 01:05:54.133
right now before it sees us.

969
01:05:54.166 --> 01:05:57.202
It?

970
01:05:57.235 --> 01:06:03.242
Okay... let's get
to the gin. Run!


971
01:06:42.514 --> 01:06:47.686
Finally, someplace
safe and not at all scary...


972
01:06:47.718 --> 01:06:49.387
We need to get
into those catwalks...


973
01:06:49.421 --> 01:06:52.658
best place to see
that thing coming.


974
01:06:54.559 --> 01:06:56.528
You don't see
this thing coming...


975
01:07:04.535 --> 01:07:08.606
God today sucks.

976
01:07:11.675 --> 01:07:13.478
Marcus to
dispatch, do you copy?


977
01:07:14.211 --> 01:07:15.412
Go ahead Deputy.

978
01:07:15.447 --> 01:07:17.215
Need immediate assistance
at the Abandoned Cotton Gin,


979
01:07:17.249 --> 01:07:18.850
possible wild animal.

980
01:07:18.883 --> 01:07:20.752
What kind of animal, deputy?

981
01:07:20.785 --> 01:07:22.521
Hairy.

982
01:07:22.553 --> 01:07:23.689
Scary.

983
01:07:23.722 --> 01:07:24.622
Pissed.

984
01:07:24.655 --> 01:07:27.892
large. Tell
them "large."


985
01:07:27.925 --> 01:07:29.193
Copy, that.

986
01:07:29.227 --> 01:07:30.862
Bring appropriate guns.

987
01:07:30.894 --> 01:07:32.496
How long till they get here?

988
01:07:32.530 --> 01:07:37.970
Not fast enough...
Come on. Careful.


989
01:07:50.914 --> 01:07:52.817
This isn't going to
keep it from getting up here.


990
01:07:52.851 --> 01:07:54.820
No, but it will slow it down.

991
01:07:54.852 --> 01:07:58.289
This will keep it
from getting up here.


992
01:08:36.827 --> 01:08:38.696
Don't guess those
are silver bullets?


993
01:08:42.433 --> 01:08:45.503
Okay! Enough! Loud!

994
01:08:45.536 --> 01:08:46.804
You're wasting your
time, you can't kill it.


995
01:08:46.838 --> 01:08:48.372
I'm just trying to scare it off.

996
01:08:48.406 --> 01:08:50.309
That's exactly
what it's trying to do.


997
01:08:50.342 --> 01:08:52.844
No, Okay, wait
wait, see I can explain.


998
01:08:52.876 --> 01:08:54.513
There's no need...
we know all about it...


999
01:08:54.545 --> 01:08:56.881
You're the little
boy, aren't you...


1000
01:08:56.915 --> 01:08:58.517
The one who survived
the Alexander Drake


1001
01:08:58.549 --> 01:08:59.617
jail house
massacre.


1002
01:08:59.651 --> 01:09:00.919
He bit you and now...

1003
01:09:00.951 --> 01:09:05.023
you're a werewolf!

1004
01:09:08.992 --> 01:09:12.430
I'm... I'm a what, now?

1005
01:09:12.464 --> 01:09:17.803
You're... a werewolf...?

1006
01:09:19.336 --> 01:09:21.439
Yeah. No. Not a
werewolf.


1007
01:09:21.473 --> 01:09:26.411
Believe it or not, no such
thing.


1008
01:09:26.443 --> 01:09:29.281
But I stabbed it with my silver
necklace and it hurt... it...


1009
01:09:29.313 --> 01:09:30.648
And the full moon...

1010
01:09:30.682 --> 01:09:32.884
It primarily hunts by
the full moon and silver or no,


1011
01:09:32.916 --> 01:09:36.021
being stabbed hurts.

1012
01:09:36.054 --> 01:09:37.923
Then what is that thing?

1013
01:09:37.955 --> 01:09:43.661
That thing is your basic,
adult North American Sasquatch.


1014
01:09:45.796 --> 01:09:50.067
Officer, would you please
watch my... cover me, with your...


1015
01:09:50.101 --> 01:09:51.870
Don't let it eat me. Thank you.

1016
01:09:51.902 --> 01:09:53.237
A Sasquatch?

1017
01:09:53.271 --> 01:09:55.674
Commonly known as a "big
foot"... characterized by its


1018
01:09:55.706 --> 01:09:57.909
isolated nature, its
territorial aggression,


1019
01:09:57.942 --> 01:10:00.746
and, if anybody had actually
paid attention...


1020
01:10:00.778 --> 01:10:03.447
its great big feet!

1021
01:10:03.481 --> 01:10:07.451
Hard to believe, I know. Nobody
believed my Grandfather either.


1022
01:10:07.485 --> 01:10:10.021
He spent his entire life trying
to convince people of


1023
01:10:10.054 --> 01:10:12.491
what he saw that night.

1024
01:10:12.523 --> 01:10:16.561
We spent years in these woods,
trying to find proof. We'd find


1025
01:10:16.594 --> 01:10:19.765
hair. Prints. Nothing
conclusive.


1026
01:10:19.798 --> 01:10:22.567
But the evidence seemed to
suggest that


1027
01:10:22.599 --> 01:10:25.003
the creature
was territorial.


1028
01:10:25.036 --> 01:10:28.407
So I thought I might be able
to lure it back to the jail


1029
01:10:28.439 --> 01:10:30.776
house given
proper incentive.


1030
01:10:30.808 --> 01:10:34.345
I hoped it would show up
during the renovations,


1031
01:10:34.379 --> 01:10:36.415
but it proved too shy.

1032
01:10:36.447 --> 01:10:38.048
Shy my ass...

1033
01:10:38.081 --> 01:10:39.316
You used us as bait.

1034
01:10:39.349 --> 01:10:42.454
I'm sorry. I honestly
thought you would be safe


1035
01:10:42.487 --> 01:10:45.557
in those cells. It was a
miscalculation. But now we've


1036
01:10:45.589 --> 01:10:48.092
antagonized the Beast,
It's moved outside of it's


1037
01:10:48.125 --> 01:10:50.661
territory. now we have to
capture it, or more


1038
01:10:50.695 --> 01:10:52.030
people could be killed.

1039
01:10:52.062 --> 01:10:53.397
Capture it how?

1040
01:10:53.430 --> 01:10:54.433
Come over here.

1041
01:10:56.934 --> 01:10:59.504
Now... it stands
here, right? When it leans


1042
01:10:59.536 --> 01:11:01.539
over to look into the cage,
we activate


1043
01:11:01.572 --> 01:11:04.375
the chain, snare
the Beast, and lower it into the


1044
01:11:04.409 --> 01:11:06.411
cage until the men with the
tranqs arrive.


1045
01:11:06.443 --> 01:11:09.113
Ok, so how are we going
to get it to look into the cage?


1046
01:11:09.147 --> 01:11:11.149
How many bullets
do you have in your gun?


1047
01:11:11.182 --> 01:11:14.186
Well I fired
three, so-Aahh!


1048
01:11:15.452 --> 01:11:18.456
I'm sorry... it's for science!

1049
01:11:19.656 --> 01:11:22.660
Don't worry, don't worry.
There's a gate at the bottom


1050
01:11:22.693 --> 01:11:25.563
of the cage. Once we snare
the Beast, we'll drag her out.


1051
01:11:25.597 --> 01:11:27.064
You're insane.

1052
01:11:27.098 --> 01:11:28.767
I'm not insane... 
I'm committed.

1053
01:11:28.799 --> 01:11:30.568
You should be committed...

1054
01:11:30.602 --> 01:11:33.872
You know, if some kids hadn't
destroyed my video footage


1055
01:11:33.905 --> 01:11:36.474
and run from the "werewolf"
we'd all still be


1056
01:11:36.508 --> 01:11:39.077
locked up safely in the jail
cell right now!


1057
01:11:55.192 --> 01:11:56.928
Move, move!

1058
01:11:57.161 --> 01:11:59.498
You know it'll
be up here in no time.


1059
01:11:59.531 --> 01:12:01.700
Then we need to find
a way to get down there.


1060
01:12:01.732 --> 01:12:03.000
Come on we'll have to jump.

1061
01:12:06.638 --> 01:12:08.974
No way.

1062
01:12:09.006 --> 01:12:19.006
Think of it as one of
your fancy cheerleader moves.


1063
01:12:22.053 --> 01:12:27.157
Look at it! So
emaciated, maybe diseased.


1064
01:12:27.191 --> 01:12:29.728
No wonder it's
so aggressive.


1065
01:12:34.531 --> 01:12:36.735
Chase, chase come
on, you will be fine.


1066
01:12:36.768 --> 01:12:38.637
Come on, you
gotta get over here.


1067
01:12:38.670 --> 01:12:48.670
I did not have to do
this at cheer try outs.


1068
01:12:50.781 --> 01:12:52.683
I got you. I gotcha!

1069
01:13:01.058 --> 01:13:03.227
So Calculating!

1070
01:13:03.260 --> 01:13:08.599
Yeah It's only a matter of
time before it...


1071
01:13:09.933 --> 01:13:13.170
Right. We should
find a way...


1072
01:13:16.840 --> 01:13:18.276
right. Good work.

1073
01:13:29.720 --> 01:13:30.722
Are you okay?

1074
01:13:30.755 --> 01:13:32.122
I don't know... I
think my arm is broke.


1075
01:13:32.156 --> 01:13:34.192
Can you open the grate?

1076
01:13:34.224 --> 01:13:35.293
It's locked.

1077
01:13:35.326 --> 01:13:36.528
Can you unlock it please?

1078
01:13:36.561 --> 01:13:39.764
Yeah... everyone
look for a latch!


1079
01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:43.602
We can't find
one, is it in there?


1080
01:13:43.634 --> 01:13:44.201
Why would
it be in here?!


1081
01:13:44.236 --> 01:13:45.470
I don't know!

1082
01:13:45.504 --> 01:13:47.738
Excellent. Keep distracting
it... I'll get the...


1083
01:13:47.772 --> 01:13:49.073
Shut up you crazy jackass!

1084
01:13:49.107 --> 01:13:50.809
Right...

1085
01:13:56.880 --> 01:13:58.650
Winch...
winch... winch...


1086
01:14:20.271 --> 01:14:22.006
Damn it!

1087
01:14:47.865 --> 01:14:50.168
Holy shit. I
can't believe that worked.


1088
01:14:52.937 --> 01:14:54.640
Found the latch.

1089
01:15:08.018 --> 01:15:09.820
Power...

1090
01:15:19.664 --> 01:15:20.732
Power!

1091
01:15:44.722 --> 01:15:45.990
What are you doing?

1092
01:15:46.023 --> 01:15:47.892
Don't worry... this
isn't the first wild animal I've


1093
01:15:47.924 --> 01:15:52.129
handled... it knows I'm not
going to hurt it...


1094
01:15:52.162 --> 01:16:01.939
It's magnificent, isn't it?
The first live Sasquatch


1095
01:16:01.973 --> 01:16:06.311
in captivity. I know we've
both had a rough night...


1096
01:16:06.344 --> 01:16:10.281
but tomorrow,
we'll be famous.


1097
01:16:10.313 --> 01:16:13.485
Mr. Howell I really
don't think you should do that.


1098
01:16:14.719 --> 01:16:17.422
Where are you going?
This is the biggest discovery


1099
01:16:17.455 --> 01:16:20.092
since the dinosaurs!

1100
01:16:24.027 --> 01:16:26.997
Tomorrow morning, this
photograph is going to be


1101
01:16:27.031 --> 01:16:30.035
on the cover of every magazine
in the world.


1102
01:16:51.789 --> 01:16:53.325
Crystal!

1103
01:16:58.929 --> 01:17:01.365
Crystal!

1104
01:17:09.206 --> 01:17:10.407
Chase, the gun!

1105
01:17:16.880 --> 01:17:20.017
Let go of my ex-boyfriend!

1106
01:17:49.045 --> 01:17:52.015
Up close it doesn't look
anything like a werewolf.


1107
01:17:52.049 --> 01:17:57.923
No. Definitely a Sasquatch.

1108
01:18:01.192 --> 01:18:05.363
More like half-squatch...

1109
01:18:05.396 --> 01:18:08.900
I was going
to say "tear-wolf"...


1110
01:18:08.933 --> 01:18:13.071
That would have
been funny, too.


1111
01:18:13.103 --> 01:18:16.106
You guys are losers...

1112
01:18:44.567 --> 01:18:47.170
What's going on? You're
eating up air with Doc George.


1113
01:18:47.204 --> 01:18:50.140
So a bunch of kids are
going down to the gin'n'smooch


1114
01:18:50.174 --> 01:18:51.375
for a full moon party.

1115
01:18:51.409 --> 01:18:53.044
Why the hell would
anyone go back out there?


1116
01:18:53.076 --> 01:18:55.178
I don't know. I guess
because there's liquor


1117
01:18:55.211 --> 01:18:56.947
and a good chance
you'll get lucky?


1118
01:18:56.981 --> 01:19:00.585
Seriously kids,
stop bleep'in calling in,


1119
01:19:00.617 --> 01:19:03.053
you are making me stupid.

1120
01:19:04.388 --> 01:19:06.224
Y'know, I like this trip
to the Gin n' Smooch better


1121
01:19:06.256 --> 01:19:07.357
than our last one.

1122
01:19:07.390 --> 01:19:08.593
Good thing I have a car.

1123
01:19:09.927 --> 01:19:12.897
Geez, girls never
let anything go do they?


1124
01:19:12.929 --> 01:19:16.034
Hey, Donny! You seen Chase?

1125
01:19:16.067 --> 01:19:18.569
Haven't really been looking...

1126
01:19:18.602 --> 01:19:22.941
She's tutoring tonight.
She's a total pedagogue now.


1127
01:19:22.973 --> 01:19:25.209
Sure-right...

1128
01:19:27.611 --> 01:19:29.314
You know he has no
idea what that means.


1129
01:19:29.347 --> 01:19:33.285
I know. That's what
makes it so satisfying.


1130
01:19:44.161 --> 01:19:47.298
That's a big foot.

1131
01:20:09.387 --> 01:20:11.054
It was a creature
once thought to exist


1132
01:20:11.088 --> 01:20:13.957
only in myths and
nightmares.


1133
01:20:13.991 --> 01:20:16.461
It burst from the woods
of a sleepy


1134
01:20:16.494 --> 01:20:20.264
Mississippi town that may
never sleep well again.


1135
01:20:20.296 --> 01:20:22.232
But while the world is
focused on the monster


1136
01:20:22.265 --> 01:20:25.068
itself, it's easy to
overlook the impact


1137
01:20:25.102 --> 01:20:29.006
This discovery has had on
the people of Marion County.


1138
01:20:29.040 --> 01:20:32.343
I'm Earnest Henderson,
join us now as we take a


1139
01:20:32.375 --> 01:20:35.445
closer look at some of
the lesser known heroes


1140
01:20:35.478 --> 01:20:40.284
who played a large hand in
bringing down a big foot.


1141
01:20:40.317 --> 01:20:42.420
Here's Irene Moffit.

1142
01:20:42.452 --> 01:20:45.289
There's no nice way
to put it. Mortimer Lefleur


1143
01:20:45.321 --> 01:20:49.059
is a conspiracy nut. The
classic local back-woodsman


1144
01:20:49.093 --> 01:20:52.964
who always had an amazing story
about lights in the sky,


1145
01:20:52.996 --> 01:20:56.299
ghosts in the attic or
mysterious creatures


1146
01:20:56.332 --> 01:20:59.103
roaming through the woods
that inevitable brought


1147
01:20:59.135 --> 01:21:00.470
laughs of
skepticism.


1148
01:21:00.504 --> 01:21:03.341
I guess you want to
know more about the Emus right?


1149
01:21:03.374 --> 01:21:05.576
You know, maybe later...

1150
01:21:05.608 --> 01:21:10.514
But as the world now knows,
Mortimer has had the last laugh.


1151
01:21:10.548 --> 01:21:14.352
The Mississippi monster, the
Southern Sasquatch, the


1152
01:21:14.384 --> 01:21:18.121
Marion Man Beast, the creature
that once stalked these woods


1153
01:21:18.155 --> 01:21:21.526
has been given many nicknames,
but Mortimer Lefleur long ago


1154
01:21:21.558 --> 01:21:26.296
had a name for the animal, that
to date has been credited with


1155
01:21:26.330 --> 01:21:30.402
the disappearances and the
deaths of nearly a dozen people.


1156
01:21:30.733 --> 01:21:34.405
I call it "The Bad Thing". or
just Bad Thing, I don't always


1157
01:21:34.437 --> 01:21:38.375
say "The Bad Thing" because "The
Bad Thing" sounds more formal


1158
01:21:38.409 --> 01:21:42.580
and I think that well, frankly,
formality when addressing


1159
01:21:42.612 --> 01:21:46.049
a creature that is basically
a, cold blooded killer, is


1160
01:21:46.082 --> 01:21:49.219
somewhat disrespectful to those
people that were consumed


1161
01:21:49.253 --> 01:21:51.755
previously.

1162
01:21:51.789 --> 01:21:54.692
Actually, autopsies on the
creature revealed that it did


1163
01:21:54.724 --> 01:21:58.728
not eat any of it's victims,
in fact, they believe that it


1164
01:21:58.762 --> 01:22:01.165
was largely
a vegetarian.


1165
01:22:01.197 --> 01:22:05.335
See now, that is just what
it wanted you to think


1166
01:22:05.702 --> 01:22:08.138
The creature wanted us to
believe that it didn't eat


1167
01:22:08.171 --> 01:22:09.240
people?

1168
01:22:09.272 --> 01:22:12.342
Yes! Exactly, Thank you.
They are just waiting for


1169
01:22:12.375 --> 01:22:16.146
us to display them in our
zoos, to, to... cart them


1170
01:22:16.179 --> 01:22:19.249
around to fairs, to take them
to petting zoos or even breed


1171
01:22:19.282 --> 01:22:23.320
them like pets. Well then,
that's when we'll discover


1172
01:22:23.353 --> 01:22:28.325
to late... that we have let
the hen into the wolfhouse.


1173
01:22:28.358 --> 01:22:29.559
Mr. Lefleur...

1174
01:22:29.594 --> 01:22:31.295
I meant to say the wolf
into the henhouse.


1175
01:22:31.327 --> 01:22:32.396
Can I say that again?

1176
01:22:32.429 --> 01:22:33.531
Well, we're live so...

1177
01:22:33.563 --> 01:22:36.166
The Wolf into the henhouse!

1178
01:22:36.834 --> 01:22:41.238
Mr. Lefleur, it's been said
that you were the first person


1179
01:22:41.272 --> 01:22:44.075
to raise awareness about the
beast being in these woods,


1180
01:22:44.107 --> 01:22:46.343
now have you seen the monster
before the first attack?


1181
01:22:46.376 --> 01:22:48.411
I don't know why you people
always want to ask questions


1182
01:22:48.445 --> 01:22:50.814
about the bad thing.

1183
01:22:50.848 --> 01:22:52.617
You want me to ask you about the
Emus don't you?


1184
01:22:52.650 --> 01:22:57.554
Genetic Mutations! And an
Abomination that if not stopped


1185
01:22:57.588 --> 01:23:00.590
will sweep across this great
state like the black plague


1186
01:23:00.624 --> 01:23:02.593
through Europe, right Duncan?

1187
01:23:05.429 --> 01:23:09.200
The three teens who with the
help of local law enforcement


1188
01:23:09.232 --> 01:23:11.568
trapped and killed the beast
have become overnight


1189
01:23:11.602 --> 01:23:15.339
celebrities, with talks of a big
budget movie already under


1190
01:23:15.371 --> 01:23:18.808
way. But there was another hero
from the Sherriff's dept.


1191
01:23:18.842 --> 01:23:22.812
Involved that night. One whose
story has not been told.


1192
01:23:22.845 --> 01:23:28.785
That is until... tonight.
Don Wrightwood has story.


1193
01:23:28.818 --> 01:23:33.423
Erin Bachmer is a career
law enforcement professional


1194
01:23:33.456 --> 01:23:36.459
But she's never carried a
gun and she'snever made an


1195
01:23:36.492 --> 01:23:40.564
arrest and until that fateful
winter Arielle Bach had


1196
01:23:40.598 --> 01:23:43.734
never saved a life. But that was
before she received a radio


1197
01:23:43.767 --> 01:23:46.737
distress call from her
co-worker and lifelong friend,


1198
01:23:46.769 --> 01:23:50.907
Deputy Ellen Marcus, Tell us
about that fateful night...


1199
01:23:50.941 --> 01:23:53.778
Tell us about the distress
call that forever changed your


1200
01:23:53.811 --> 01:23:57.881
life and the life of everyone
here at Marion County.


1201
01:23:57.915 --> 01:24:04.322
Our office uses a central
dispatching service


1202
01:24:04.354 --> 01:24:05.723
Go On.

1203
01:24:08.791 --> 01:24:14.698
I'm the office manager, I
file and organize reports.


1204
01:24:14.732 --> 01:24:17.768
Radio communications come in and
go out through a third party


1205
01:24:17.800 --> 01:24:20.804
service

1206
01:24:20.838 --> 01:24:23.441
There you were. Grossly
untrained for this kind of


1207
01:24:23.473 --> 01:24:26.910
thing, unsure of what to do, the
life of your friend and the


1208
01:24:26.943 --> 01:24:30.414
lives of three young children on
the line, what was going through


1209
01:24:30.446 --> 01:24:32.249
your mind?

1210
01:24:32.282 --> 01:24:37.554
I remember thinking, "My
God!" Why is deputy


1211
01:24:37.588 --> 01:24:42.492
Marcus calling me, the office
manager, at my home...


1212
01:24:42.526 --> 01:24:44.894
On my personal
phone, when she


1213
01:24:44.928 --> 01:24:48.366
should have been using
her radio to call into


1214
01:24:48.398 --> 01:24:50.700
central dispatch, who has the

1215
01:24:50.733 --> 01:24:55.740
capability of dispatching the
required services.


1216
01:24:55.772 --> 01:25:01.845
Centrally. Hence the name
Central Dispatch.


1217
01:25:03.546 --> 01:25:06.983
It must have been very hard for
you to deal with that.


1218
01:25:07.017 --> 01:25:09.653
Get out of my house.

1219
01:25:09.687 --> 01:25:10.755
I'm sorry?

1220
01:25:10.787 --> 01:25:16.526
And you were also wrong about my
not carrying a gun.


1221
01:25:18.795 --> 01:25:20.932
I think we should leave...

1222
01:25:21.965 --> 01:25:24.302
Come On Let's go!

1223
01:25:24.335 --> 01:25:28.272
And abandoned jailhouse, a
gruesomely murdered family.


1224
01:25:28.304 --> 01:25:31.775
And the restless spirit of a
crazed criminal. These were


1225
01:25:31.808 --> 01:25:35.512
the elements of a decades old
camp fire story inspired by


1226
01:25:35.545 --> 01:25:39.282
the creature, Duncan Toose is
best known for recounting


1227
01:25:39.316 --> 01:25:42.353
this local folktale...
Hello Mr. Toose.


1228
01:25:42.385 --> 01:25:43.420
Hi.

1229
01:25:43.454 --> 01:25:45.356
I understand you tell the most
accurate and frankly


1230
01:25:45.388 --> 01:25:48.425
chilling version of the jail
house massacre...


1231
01:25:49.626 --> 01:25:51.795
Would you mind sharing your
account of that harrowing


1232
01:25:51.829 --> 01:25:54.064
incident.

1233
01:25:55.866 --> 01:26:02.540
It was a night, just like
tonight. Moon was full


1234
01:26:02.973 --> 01:26:04.642
And out of the woods...

1235
01:26:04.674 --> 01:26:08.044
Mr. Toose, I'm very sorry we
have to break in here, we


1236
01:26:08.077 --> 01:26:10.714
have live on the phone Sherriff
Bran Evans,


1237
01:26:10.747 --> 01:26:11.915
Hi, Ernest.

1238
01:26:11.948 --> 01:26:13.951
Sherriff Evans, how did you
manage to live through your


1239
01:26:13.983 --> 01:26:16.387
face to face showdown with the
beast?


1240
01:26:16.420 --> 01:26:19.357
Well, to be honest, I think it
was just a combination of


1241
01:26:19.389 --> 01:26:21.791
dumb luck and old fashioned
playing opposum.


1242
01:26:21.825 --> 01:26:24.662
Amazing, well that
clears everything up perfectly.


1243
01:26:24.695 --> 01:26:27.331
And I see no reason to ask any
futher questions.


1244
01:26:27.363 --> 01:26:28.564
I appreciate it

1245
01:26:28.598 --> 01:26:32.102
Coming up after the break,
Mr. Toose, your still with us...


1246
01:26:32.635 --> 01:26:35.473
Well Mr. Toose if your still
willing, we'd very much like


1247
01:26:35.505 --> 01:26:39.543
for you to share with us your
version of the legendary


1248
01:26:39.576 --> 01:26:43.881
jailhouse massacre.

1249
01:26:43.914 --> 01:26:51.988
It was a night, just
like tonight, the moon was


1250
01:26:52.022 --> 01:26:56.794
the moon was full. And the
monster come out of them


1251
01:26:56.826 --> 01:27:01.398
woods and attacked people!

1252
01:27:07.905 --> 01:27:11.041
That's it.

1253
01:27:12.080 --> 01:27:15.608
