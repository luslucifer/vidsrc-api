1
00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:51.940
Los Angeles is considered as a
city of dreams around the world.

2
00:01:07.413 --> 00:01:11.834
Surfing, sunbathing, -

3
00:01:11.918 --> 00:01:14.754
beautiful women, -

4
00:01:16.256 --> 00:01:19.551
Hollywood, Rodeo Drive, -

5
00:01:20.802 --> 00:01:24.931
celebrities, glamor and movie stars.

6
00:01:32.063 --> 00:01:36.025
For me, LA is a face-lift.

7
00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:42.490
Before the houses of well-manicured lawns, -

8
00:01:42.574 --> 00:01:46.995
golf courses and skyscrapers -

9
00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:52.333
the place was just plain desert.

10
00:01:58.756 --> 00:02:01.676
We see only the surface.

11
00:02:02.677 --> 00:02:06.097
L.A. does not have to be cool.

12
00:02:06.181 --> 00:02:09.350
Suffice it to pretend to be.

13
00:02:09.434 --> 00:02:12.270
His eyes not to believe.

14
00:02:12.353 --> 00:02:15.231
Here, image is everything.

15
00:02:28.036 --> 00:02:32.582
Those who lead the city, write laws -

16
00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.295
and are trained -

17
00:02:37.378 --> 00:02:41.633
not a moral than a guy
who is looking for dumpster -

18
00:02:41.716 --> 00:02:44.427
cans and bottles.

19
00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:53.353
They just get themselves to sound as such.

20
00:02:53.436 --> 00:02:59.025
They fall down on their
own paskapuheisiinsa and are fooling themselves.

21
00:03:00.026 --> 00:03:03.238
Packaging is important product.

22
00:03:37.105 --> 00:03:41.442
California is the so-called three
-Hut law.

23
00:03:41.526 --> 00:03:45.905
It may at first glance seem fair. 
Like a baseball.

24
00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:48.950
Three strikes, and the player gets out.

25
00:03:49.033 --> 00:03:54.330
It of course depends on which
side of the street is born.

26
00:04:24.319 --> 00:04:27.906
- Juanito? 
- Juan?

27
00:04:43.129 --> 00:04:45.757
What has happened?

28
00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:49.510
Say something. Juan?

29
00:04:52.305 --> 00:04:56.309
- Hands. 
- What is going on?

30
00:04:56.392 --> 00:04:59.229
- Say something, Juan. 
- Stand back.

31
00:05:01.397 --> 00:05:05.151
- Back up! 
- What's going on here?

32
00:05:08.571 --> 00:05:13.243
I urge you to tell us. 
You have no right ...

33
00:05:35.473 --> 00:05:37.642
Around it went.

34
00:05:56.411 --> 00:06:01.624
- Tell me now what happened. 
- About it went. Really.

35
00:06:01.708 --> 00:06:07.338
Think about yourself in my place
and listen to the story carefully.

36
00:06:07.422 --> 00:06:12.343
exported from the bank the money
and the other suspects are missing.

37
00:06:12.427 --> 00:06:14.929
You know me.

38
00:06:16.222 --> 00:06:19.350
I thought that I also Manny-uncle.

39
00:06:19.434 --> 00:06:21.811
It's been a long time.

40
00:06:21.895 --> 00:06:25.190
Sergeant Veritas, 
I do not lie to you.

41
00:06:33.489 --> 00:06:37.619
And this would be the first
time that I am wrong about someone.

42
00:06:39.412 --> 00:06:43.750
What else can I say? 
I swear that I am speaking the truth.

43
00:06:49.547 --> 00:06:51.674
I understand.

44
00:06:52.926 --> 00:06:55.845
I just do not
know, no one else understands.

45
00:06:57.805 --> 00:07:00.433
- Do you understand? 
- I understand.

46
00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:31.714
Open the trunk.

47
00:07:36.511 --> 00:07:39.097
Come out.

48
00:07:47.522 --> 00:07:50.024
Email this letter.

49
00:07:50.108 --> 00:07:53.903
- A neat jacket! 
- Be quiet. Take the letter box at that.

50
00:08:10.295 --> 00:08:13.882
- He thinks he's Kobe. 
- But she is cute.

51
00:09:04.682 --> 00:09:07.101
Run! Come on. Start the car.

52
00:09:08.394 --> 00:09:10.772
Step on it now!

53
00:09:15.860 --> 00:09:18.905
Keep hands visible at all times

54
00:09:32.126 --> 00:09:35.838
Manny died. I am a ghost.

55
00:09:35.922 --> 00:09:38.341
We do not have time for that.

56
00:09:38.424 --> 00:09:43.888
Manny is gone, but you, me, and
the mother of Diana we are a family.

57
00:09:45.849 --> 00:09:47.976
What is Diana think about this?

58
00:09:48.059 --> 00:09:50.228
He misses you.

59
00:09:50.311 --> 00:09:52.063
He is curious.

60
00:09:53.398 --> 00:09:58.027
I'm trying to find a
great moment to tell him.

61
00:09:58.111 --> 00:10:01.990
- Now let's talk about you. 
- I could be accused of Manny's death.

62
00:10:04.033 --> 00:10:08.121
I can get a more lenient
sentence if the calves of myself.

63
00:10:09.664 --> 00:10:14.460
- We need someone who cares about you. 
- Hiring someone in the workplace.

64
00:10:14.544 --> 00:10:18.381
They are party lawyers. 
The story is complex.

65
00:10:21.718 --> 00:10:28.057
I do not have time to explain now. 
Did Manny never attorney Alan Hartford?

66
00:10:28.141 --> 00:10:31.728
- I do not believe. 
- Pine was his business card.

67
00:10:31.811 --> 00:10:36.149
- Do not you know him? 
- The lawyer that Manny felt.

68
00:10:36.232 --> 00:10:39.235
Hiring him immediately.

69
00:10:43.990 --> 00:10:49.495
Fear of Spain can not be understood
by the fact that the adhesive label.

70
00:10:50.997 --> 00:10:55.293
The zoo visitors have
seen the caged animal -

71
00:10:55.376 --> 00:10:58.713
is less than half
of its own by itself.

72
00:11:03.051 --> 00:11:08.389
Man's heart does not get to
know, if you steal from her youth.

73
00:11:09.390 --> 00:11:12.936
Your brother drove the getaway car.

74
00:11:13.019 --> 00:11:17.398
He is the owner of a
car, the deceased Manny Garcia, a relative.

75
00:11:17.482 --> 00:11:21.444
Abduction can not be used in defense.

76
00:11:21.528 --> 00:11:25.823
The boy also has previous infractions. 
Little crimes most part, -

77
00:11:25.907 --> 00:11:28.910
but they cancel out an unlucky chance alone.

78
00:11:28.993 --> 00:11:33.665
- He is only a child. 
- According to law, an adult.

79
00:11:33.748 --> 00:11:37.961
LA County tuomitsemisprosentti a jury trial is 78.

80
00:11:38.044 --> 00:11:43.299
- 93% if calculated according to the complaints. 
- Sounds like you do not want a story.

81
00:11:43.383 --> 00:11:48.471
If he's supposed to win,
no one will take this.

82
00:11:48.555 --> 00:11:51.724
- How much do I owe you? 
- Angie, sit down.

83
00:11:51.808 --> 00:11:54.435
- Mr. Hartford. 
- Alan.

84
00:11:54.519 --> 00:11:57.230
I do not want
to waste your time, Alan.

85
00:11:57.313 --> 00:12:02.026
Angie, I just want
to be honest. Miss Garcia!

86
00:12:02.110 --> 00:12:05.613
Can you sit down?

87
00:12:11.077 --> 00:12:13.204
Angie.

88
00:12:22.380 --> 00:12:27.176
As I said, your uncle was my client. 
I knew him as a friend -

89
00:12:27.260 --> 00:12:33.266
but I trusted his word. 
I was upset by the fact that he was involved in this.

90
00:12:33.349 --> 00:12:35.810
He just flop down.

91
00:12:35.894 --> 00:12:40.273
- I do not think about a simple answer. 
- Once a criminal, always a criminal.

92
00:12:40.356 --> 00:12:44.068
Understand it, if you lived
in the same area as me.

93
00:12:45.987 --> 00:12:49.073
Do you understand this?

94
00:12:49.157 --> 00:12:52.285
This is a $ 10 000 advance payment.

95
00:12:52.368 --> 00:12:55.997
Manny-enoltasi.

96
00:12:56.080 --> 00:12:59.751
Postmark is a robbery by day.

97
00:13:05.798 --> 00:13:08.509
I think your brother's story.

98
00:13:11.679 --> 00:13:15.475
You said that no lawyer take the case.

99
00:13:15.558 --> 00:13:19.812
When I began to represent Mannya,
he was gaining the third sentence.

100
00:13:19.896 --> 00:13:24.526
The end of life in prison. 
Manny was released less than 11 months.

101
00:14:22.542 --> 00:14:25.628
Hei, Juan. Olen Alan Hartford.

102
00:14:25.712 --> 00:14:29.841
- Your sister Angie hired me. 
- I know.

103
00:14:34.679 --> 00:14:38.850
We are sitting here because
of an unusual chain of events.

104
00:14:38.933 --> 00:14:43.730
I knew your uncle, so I
think that this is a good reason.

105
00:14:43.813 --> 00:14:47.066
Initial treatment is tomorrow.

106
00:14:47.150 --> 00:14:49.277
Prompted me something there?

107
00:14:49.360 --> 00:14:54.657
The prosecution calls witnesses
to appear before the judge.

108
00:14:54.741 --> 00:15:00.288
Take it easy. I stand where I
do not call you or anyone else.

109
00:15:00.371 --> 00:15:03.666
- I was slaughtered. 
- The preliminary hearing -

110
00:15:03.750 --> 00:15:09.547
Judge to decide whether the evidence for trial.

111
00:15:09.631 --> 00:15:13.384
Criminal record is pretty short.

112
00:15:13.468 --> 00:15:16.971
- Double
-FI card, no convictions. 
- E-cards?

113
00:15:20.600 --> 00:15:23.645
Have you told the
police, with whom you exercise?

114
00:15:23.728 --> 00:15:26.898
Did he jutellessanne a small green card?

115
00:15:26.981 --> 00:15:29.984
Filled, but there is a long time.

116
00:15:30.068 --> 00:15:33.947
- How long? 
- Four or five years.

117
00:15:34.030 --> 00:15:36.616
I was 12. Did I do something wrong?

118
00:15:36.699 --> 00:15:40.328
You do not as
bad as I do. Listen.

119
00:15:40.411 --> 00:15:43.998
Manny was a good guy. 
I respected him.

120
00:15:44.082 --> 00:15:46.042
Now we have to think of you.

121
00:15:46.125 --> 00:15:49.963
I told you, I do not know anything. 
Manny promised that I get to drive.

122
00:15:56.844 --> 00:16:00.348
This will be a 20-year cake, shithead.

123
00:16:07.146 --> 00:16:10.608
- Is there someone at the door? 
- I just.

124
00:16:24.497 --> 00:16:28.418
- You're a great actor. 
- Let it be. That was all bullshit.

125
00:16:28.501 --> 00:16:33.298
- Yes. The movie will be the world's best. 
- Shut up. Let's go.

126
00:16:33.381 --> 00:16:36.009
I do not have a license yet.

127
00:16:36.092 --> 00:16:39.053
So what? Drive now only.

128
00:16:50.315 --> 00:16:54.194
- You said that the honor is the most important thing. 
- Forget about it and listen.

129
00:16:54.277 --> 00:16:59.032
- It must respect. 
- Respect and winning are a different matter.

130
00:16:59.115 --> 00:17:03.328
- My friends are involved in ... 
- It did not never get rid of.

131
00:17:04.329 --> 00:17:10.001
That is right. 
Angie, your mother, Diana. 
It is your family.

132
00:17:10.084 --> 00:17:14.130
5th Street Muertos speaks of brotherhood. 
We received them.

133
00:17:14.214 --> 00:17:17.258
It's bullshit, if not sit in jail.

134
00:17:17.342 --> 00:17:22.055
And the worst suffering from a life sentence. 
They do not have anything to do.

135
00:17:22.138 --> 00:17:27.685
They just want a bit of
money and a girl, fuck that.

136
00:17:27.769 --> 00:17:31.981
They use to us, and I'm
going to come back to them.

137
00:17:32.065 --> 00:17:37.445
- I do not get it. 
- I do not give to forget my crime.

138
00:17:37.529 --> 00:17:40.615
- You're an actor. 
- I'm not.

139
00:17:40.698 --> 00:17:43.952
Starred in only mobsters who I am.

140
00:17:47.038 --> 00:17:51.167
My allegedly telling secrets in order to
get the role of the Gang of Five.

141
00:17:51.251 --> 00:17:55.588
They want to play a role. 
In this way, with me can be maintained.

142
00:17:56.881 --> 00:18:00.260
Smile now. Enollasi have a plan.

143
00:18:00.343 --> 00:18:03.638
This is an important day behind the wheel.

144
00:18:03.721 --> 00:18:06.933
It should smells wonderful.

145
00:18:12.605 --> 00:18:15.900
He is a good
boy, but he has E-cards.

146
00:18:15.984 --> 00:18:19.612
Field Identification Cards of years ago.

147
00:18:19.696 --> 00:18:23.032
Among them is a long
time, and he was still innocent.

148
00:18:23.116 --> 00:18:27.537
However, it does not matter. 
He says they belong Muertos -

149
00:18:27.620 --> 00:18:30.456
and the only tattoo reveal it.

150
00:18:30.540 --> 00:18:33.918
- He is only a child. 
- I understand.

151
00:18:34.002 --> 00:18:38.631
However, refer to the small
cards into a big word. Gang.

152
00:18:45.013 --> 00:18:47.390
Choices.

153
00:18:47.473 --> 00:18:50.894
In my childhood -

154
00:18:50.977 --> 00:18:54.981
The future was as bright
as the bottom of the pit.

155
00:18:57.442 --> 00:19:00.486
The slave, who cut someone else's lawn, -

156
00:19:00.570 --> 00:19:05.700
clean up someone else's toilets, breaking
their backs, so that others may eat.

157
00:19:05.783 --> 00:19:10.622
And what it gives to pay? 
Other residues.

158
00:19:11.748 --> 00:19:15.501
I chose the only logical option.

159
00:19:15.585 --> 00:19:17.629
I live for this day.

160
00:19:24.677 --> 00:19:27.555
Only the present moment is the matter.

161
00:19:36.731 --> 00:19:39.609
- What do you want? 
- I'm with Javier.

162
00:19:39.692 --> 00:19:43.363
I can not let you in. Sorry. 
It is not just a visit.

163
00:19:43.446 --> 00:19:46.032
What the hell?

164
00:19:52.705 --> 00:19:54.958
You're cute.

165
00:20:25.822 --> 00:20:28.199
- Get out! 
- Out of here.

166
00:20:42.672 --> 00:20:46.509
There it is.

167
00:20:46.593 --> 00:20:49.512
I think wearing a
pink soft spot for you.

168
00:20:49.596 --> 00:20:54.058
- Does not like. 
He laughed at you. 
- For you, he laughed.

169
00:20:54.142 --> 00:20:58.730
- Go talk to him. 
- Point. The night is still young.

170
00:20:58.813 --> 00:21:02.108
And I need to catch up.

171
00:21:03.860 --> 00:21:05.904
What the hell?

172
00:21:09.490 --> 00:21:14.120
- What's wrong with him? 
- The girls are queuing up at least.

173
00:21:14.204 --> 00:21:16.789
- Javier? 
- Yes.

174
00:21:16.873 --> 00:21:22.253
- She is think of winning the lottery. 
- Ink does it.

175
00:21:22.337 --> 00:21:24.464
He invites us.

176
00:21:25.840 --> 00:21:28.551
What's up, Javi? Introduce us.

177
00:21:28.635 --> 00:21:32.764
These are my friends. 
You know Juan?

178
00:21:32.847 --> 00:21:34.974
- I do not. 
- Manny will feel at least.

179
00:21:35.058 --> 00:21:37.477
Juan is Manny's sister's son.

180
00:21:37.560 --> 00:21:42.065
Are you Manny's sister's son? 
You do not look anything from him, koulupoju.

181
00:21:42.148 --> 00:21:46.945
I have a little catching up to do. 
You will be the first night of dreams short.

182
00:21:49.781 --> 00:21:53.409
I'm thirsty. Searching for something to drink.

183
00:21:59.165 --> 00:22:03.127
I'm going to do it.
Two tattoo. Do you mess?

184
00:22:03.211 --> 00:22:07.173
Without a tattoo may not be the hive.

185
00:22:18.059 --> 00:22:23.106
Damn, girl. It is a good melons.

186
00:22:25.275 --> 00:22:28.111
Do not do that. Please.

187
00:22:29.404 --> 00:22:34.534
That's a new one. Sukiyaki-style. Awesome.

188
00:22:54.846 --> 00:22:58.224
- Hey honey. 
- Hey, grandma.

189
00:22:59.392 --> 00:23:03.730
- How was school? 
- How nice. We put the play food.

190
00:23:03.813 --> 00:23:07.525
- Is Juan your home? 
- Is. He came half an hour ago.

191
00:23:16.326 --> 00:23:20.163
Say Juan for that, 
I need to speak. 
He is allowed to have an evening at home.

192
00:23:20.246 --> 00:23:23.291
- Is not she at home? 
- He's gone again.

193
00:23:23.374 --> 00:23:28.463
- Is something wrong? 
- Yes. I just need to go on time.

194
00:23:28.546 --> 00:23:31.090
Be nice.

195
00:23:31.174 --> 00:23:35.094
- Can I have a cookie? 
- You know where they are. 
I will come soon.

196
00:23:54.614 --> 00:23:56.866
Do you have threes?

197
00:23:58.785 --> 00:24:01.120
- Is. 
- I won!

198
00:24:01.204 --> 00:24:04.874
- That's not fair. I lead. 
- I am very well.

199
00:24:04.958 --> 00:24:08.711
- Are not I, Grandma? 
- You are well, princess.

200
00:24:08.795 --> 00:24:13.466
- Mother. Call a doctor. 
- Do you need medicine? Small or big?

201
00:24:13.550 --> 00:24:17.345
- Great. 
- Quickly, doctor. 
We're losing him.

202
00:24:17.428 --> 00:24:21.057
You remind me very much Manny-enoasi.

203
00:24:21.140 --> 00:24:24.102
- What? 
- Are there any other here?

204
00:24:24.185 --> 00:24:28.815
- How so? 
- That, as he had before.

205
00:24:38.741 --> 00:24:41.661
You did it again, Doctor. Thank you.

206
00:24:41.744 --> 00:24:46.332
- Did you see that? 
I rescued him. 
- You will become the world's best doctor.

207
00:24:46.416 --> 00:24:49.502
- Leikitäänkö next with dolls? 
- I will come soon.

208
00:24:49.586 --> 00:24:51.880
I raise my bed dolls.

209
00:24:55.925 --> 00:24:58.928
What did you mean when you
said "kind of like he was before?"

210
00:25:00.263 --> 00:25:03.266
Manny uncle was a patron Helene-aunt.

211
00:25:03.349 --> 00:25:06.102
He enjoyed receipt to
take care of Helen Block.

212
00:25:06.186 --> 00:25:09.022
They were playing like you and Dianakin.

213
00:25:09.105 --> 00:25:13.276
Fortunately. I do not want to
have anything to do with your aunt.

214
00:25:13.359 --> 00:25:17.322
I was crazy about boys. Foolish.

215
00:25:17.405 --> 00:25:20.408
Was your mother's already dead?

216
00:25:20.491 --> 00:25:22.243
It was.

217
00:25:22.327 --> 00:25:24.829
Thankfully pine.

218
00:25:24.913 --> 00:25:27.373
He was a 16-year-old, like you now.

219
00:25:27.457 --> 00:25:33.296
He still seemed to know what your aunt needed. 
And he's been fighting, then.

220
00:25:34.297 --> 00:25:38.801
- Hard to believe. 
- Of course it is. 
He was sensitive.

221
00:25:38.885 --> 00:25:43.306
He helped mother in cooking, when
you noticed this tired at work.

222
00:25:43.389 --> 00:25:48.353
- And he did not care for the father's bullying. 
- Mannyko? Really?

223
00:25:48.436 --> 00:25:50.605
Of course it is.

224
00:25:51.606 --> 00:25:53.858
What happened?

225
00:25:55.068 --> 00:25:58.696
This is a tough area. 
You know that.

226
00:25:59.697 --> 00:26:02.534
Manny-enoasi beaten.

227
00:26:02.617 --> 00:26:05.620
He came home in tears.

228
00:26:05.703 --> 00:26:09.749
And then ukkisi slapped him because of crying.

229
00:26:11.751 --> 00:26:15.129
He was a miserable man.

230
00:26:20.009 --> 00:26:23.096
- What's the matter? 
- I'm angry at myself -

231
00:26:23.179 --> 00:26:27.141
- When I did not do anything. 
- He was a drunk. 
There is growing.

232
00:26:27.225 --> 00:26:29.769
Let it be.

233
00:26:31.145 --> 00:26:33.773
What happened to the pine?

234
00:26:33.857 --> 00:26:37.318
What made him change?

235
00:26:37.402 --> 00:26:40.488
Manny-uncle was fast.

236
00:26:40.572 --> 00:26:43.575
He always got away.

237
00:26:43.658 --> 00:26:47.370
But one day ukkisi caught him.

238
00:26:47.453 --> 00:26:50.623
Manny lay on the floor.

239
00:26:50.707 --> 00:26:54.794
Ukkisi punched and slapped.

240
00:26:55.795 --> 00:27:00.133
Your uncle was a small kerana
and protected himself with his hands.

241
00:27:00.216 --> 00:27:03.261
However, he did not hit back.

242
00:27:03.344 --> 00:27:06.681
And Dad just hit.

243
00:27:08.308 --> 00:27:14.022
Eventually Manny arms were bruised so
that they remain at the top.

244
00:27:15.940 --> 00:27:18.568
Although the arms flashed in the country,

245
00:27:19.652 --> 00:27:21.905
Dad did not stop.

246
00:27:26.993 --> 00:27:29.287
Manny's face ...

247
00:27:29.370 --> 00:27:31.748
I will never forget it.

248
00:27:31.831 --> 00:27:34.834
I did not recognize him.

249
00:27:34.918 --> 00:27:36.878
Tikit ...

250
00:27:38.504 --> 00:27:41.049
He looked like Frankenstein evening.

251
00:27:47.764 --> 00:27:50.517
Come here.

252
00:27:53.645 --> 00:27:56.523
We'll be fine.

253
00:28:03.363 --> 00:28:07.867
Life is a game with rules.

254
00:28:09.369 --> 00:28:12.580
the purpose of the rules is
to make the game more fair.

255
00:28:15.124 --> 00:28:18.127
Second place means nothing.

256
00:28:18.211 --> 00:28:22.131
If you only have
to overcome the matter -

257
00:28:24.175 --> 00:28:27.637
life becomes circumvention and breach of the rules.

258
00:28:40.483 --> 00:28:43.361
You lost the battle. 
Do you want to discard and war?

259
00:28:43.444 --> 00:28:47.657
- Figure this out now. 
- Come on, sunshine.

260
00:28:52.245 --> 00:28:55.540
- Draws the menacing just because you're a cop. 
- You'd better leave.

261
00:28:55.623 --> 00:28:58.001
Hello, sunshine.

262
00:29:04.507 --> 00:29:07.719
Such dogs are dangerous only in the herd.

263
00:29:07.802 --> 00:29:10.180
Bark is worse than bite.

264
00:29:13.516 --> 00:29:16.853
- Have you seen him before? 
- I do not.

265
00:29:16.936 --> 00:29:19.480
- Do not you? 
- I do not.

266
00:29:19.564 --> 00:29:24.903
- It seemed that the two know each other. 
- He's gone.

267
00:29:27.822 --> 00:29:33.703
- Maybe he's just afraid of sharing our best to play it. 
- Are yours skills in a safe place, old man.

268
00:29:33.786 --> 00:29:37.540
Jormani after all works yet.

269
00:29:37.624 --> 00:29:43.421
- You were born to play. 
- I have had a good coach.

270
00:29:45.131 --> 00:29:47.342
Visit the re-qualifiers.

271
00:29:47.425 --> 00:29:52.055
You were years away, but you needed.

272
00:29:52.138 --> 00:29:57.560
I do not like this any longer. 
And I'm sick of this for commanding.

273
00:30:03.233 --> 00:30:07.070
Excuse me. You are right. 
I like my mouth shut.

274
00:30:07.153 --> 00:30:10.823
A nice just to get you back.

275
00:30:10.907 --> 00:30:14.661
- Glad you're here. 
- Home again. It feels good.

276
00:30:16.287 --> 00:30:19.374
- The team affiliation always feels. 
- Sgt.

277
00:30:19.457 --> 00:30:24.379
That's why those morons fighting for second instead.

278
00:30:24.462 --> 00:30:27.090
Let go.

279
00:30:29.717 --> 00:30:33.096
- Hey, koulupoju. 
- Hey, the street girl.

280
00:30:33.179 --> 00:30:35.932
- Pretty cool. 
- You are hot.

281
00:30:36.015 --> 00:30:39.644
- Let's go. 
- The moment valkku.

282
00:30:42.021 --> 00:30:44.732
- You better go. 
- Is the lesson over?

283
00:30:44.816 --> 00:30:48.570
Now that you are a tough guy. 
Nice movements, by the way.

284
00:30:48.653 --> 00:30:52.448
You have not seen anything yet. 
I am a better man to man.

285
00:30:52.532 --> 00:30:55.952
- Come on, Juan. 
- Are you here, when I have won?

286
00:30:56.035 --> 00:31:00.707
Hurry up. Like me girl
has a lot to do.

287
00:31:02.250 --> 00:31:06.254
- Come on. 
- Then let's begin.

288
00:31:47.462 --> 00:31:50.423
What is going on?

289
00:32:12.278 --> 00:32:14.572
Time-out.

290
00:32:16.449 --> 00:32:18.618
51-50.

291
00:32:18.701 --> 00:32:23.248
Listen. This is a sphere, not his ass.

292
00:32:23.331 --> 00:32:28.670
Do you not see that he is hustling you? 
If you get a chance, take it.

293
00:33:09.002 --> 00:33:11.421
- Need a ride home? 
- I do not.

294
00:33:11.504 --> 00:33:15.091
You were a good peak. 
You do not need the rest of us.

295
00:33:15.174 --> 00:33:17.552
And you're her.

296
00:33:17.635 --> 00:33:20.263
You lied. He is good.

297
00:33:20.346 --> 00:33:23.141
- The guy is a chump! 
- Of course.

298
00:33:24.642 --> 00:33:27.437
- Buy donuts. 
- For me the muffin.

299
00:33:27.520 --> 00:33:32.066
- You really needs a ride home? 
- I do not. See you later.

300
00:33:46.831 --> 00:33:52.045
- Lower the drink. 
You have a lot of catching up to do. 
- Rosa is a party. 
Let's go there.

301
00:33:52.128 --> 00:33:55.381
We both know that we
do not go there ever again.

302
00:33:55.465 --> 00:33:58.343
You may need you. I get to.

303
00:33:58.426 --> 00:34:02.222
we go up to Rosa, even though we
may not even get to join the party?

304
00:34:02.305 --> 00:34:05.683
- Stupid jerk. 
- We already have some beer.

305
00:34:05.767 --> 00:34:09.020
Relax and get a bit of hay.

306
00:34:11.856 --> 00:34:15.443
Do not be afraid. 
I'm not your mother.

307
00:34:15.527 --> 00:34:20.323
- Throw it will dilute the crap elsewhere. 
- This is strong.

308
00:34:20.406 --> 00:34:25.495
- 100 per cent alcohol Mexico. 
- You will be able, therefore, to read?

309
00:34:29.958 --> 00:34:32.252
Whittier Boulevard!

310
00:34:41.803 --> 00:34:44.931
You will become increasingly cooler, of
course, when you get your tattoo.

311
00:34:45.014 --> 00:34:47.684
What is wrong with you? 
Do you want to burn?

312
00:34:47.767 --> 00:34:54.023
After all, this not even a cloud. 
Strip club, you can see the condition of women.

313
00:34:56.067 --> 00:34:58.653
It is a moron out there.

314
00:35:16.963 --> 00:35:19.841
Have fun.

315
00:35:44.073 --> 00:35:46.534
Do you like that?

316
00:35:49.787 --> 00:35:51.706
Veritas guy.

317
00:36:27.325 --> 00:36:31.788
I'll suddenly tobacco. 
I make your images ready then.

318
00:36:31.871 --> 00:36:34.624
Just let go.

319
00:36:36.042 --> 00:36:38.836
Pure teeth together. 
You know that it will sting.

320
00:36:38.920 --> 00:36:41.130
Nynny.

321
00:36:43.591 --> 00:36:47.762
- Look. You like this for sure. 
- Do not Cry.

322
00:36:52.225 --> 00:36:54.769
Next stop tussukaupunki.

323
00:36:54.853 --> 00:36:58.731
- We are the next generation. 
- Go with your head up or not at all.

324
00:36:58.815 --> 00:37:02.026
The last turn. 
Show them what you have. 
Muertos forever!

325
00:37:02.110 --> 00:37:05.280
Three friends drive with pride. 
And in the cloud!

326
00:37:17.125 --> 00:37:19.711
Wait.

327
00:37:22.005 --> 00:37:24.299
What now? What is going on?

328
00:37:24.382 --> 00:37:28.970
No goddamn it. Not now.

329
00:37:32.015 --> 00:37:34.893
Manny plays. Emergency situation.

330
00:37:34.976 --> 00:37:41.983
- No can do. Let's go. 
- Not to answer the phone.

331
00:37:45.069 --> 00:37:49.407
- Over there. 
- How are you? 
That son of a bitch just took off.

332
00:37:52.410 --> 00:37:55.997
You know what to do. Let's go.

333
00:38:46.339 --> 00:38:50.969
- Cop devil. 
- Calm down. Think about it.

334
00:38:51.052 --> 00:38:55.640
If'll deal with that
asshole, follow the shit storm.

335
00:38:55.723 --> 00:38:59.644
The best option is to
get an extract from pine.

336
00:39:04.232 --> 00:39:06.860
I have a plan.

337
00:39:18.746 --> 00:39:23.334
The perfect technique. 
Two steps, period.

338
00:39:23.418 --> 00:39:26.087
I take credit for.

339
00:39:26.170 --> 00:39:29.132
- What are you doing here? 
- We are at work.

340
00:39:29.215 --> 00:39:31.676
- What about you? 
- Nothing.

341
00:39:32.844 --> 00:39:36.472
- Change your mind and you want to include? 
- I moved.

342
00:39:36.556 --> 00:39:39.100
What enthusiasm.

343
00:39:39.184 --> 00:39:41.394
I'm serious.

344
00:39:41.477 --> 00:39:44.689
You can not lie properly. 
It's not a bad thing.

345
00:39:44.772 --> 00:39:48.484
- I was not trying to lie. 
- I know.

346
00:39:48.568 --> 00:39:52.071
- Girl Problems? 
- Maybe.

347
00:39:53.072 --> 00:39:57.994
I asked, did you know they are gang members in the audience. 
They have Muertos.

348
00:39:58.077 --> 00:40:01.664
Not here. Tops of many, as your uncle.

349
00:40:01.748 --> 00:40:04.959
- The girl is their property. 
- What's the matter with you and Mannya?

350
00:40:09.672 --> 00:40:14.928
For some things can be
turned back on. They did not.

351
00:40:15.011 --> 00:40:19.891
I'm tired of it, that the commandments
of me all the time. Paskat it.

352
00:40:23.811 --> 00:40:27.899
You are right. 
Who am I to advise?

353
00:40:29.734 --> 00:40:32.111
You will become a man, you
like it or you do not.

354
00:40:32.195 --> 00:40:36.407
And the man is responsible for their choices.

355
00:40:37.742 --> 00:40:42.205
This is your choice. 
You can be a man or a slave.

356
00:40:45.041 --> 00:40:47.544
Consider carefully.

357
00:40:49.337 --> 00:40:51.798
Whatever.

358
00:41:04.519 --> 00:41:08.815
"You can be a
man or a slave." Devil.

359
00:41:30.295 --> 00:41:33.631
Please do not take offense.

360
00:42:56.214 --> 00:42:58.174
What is this?

361
00:43:00.260 --> 00:43:02.929
- Cut! 
- Aborting.

362
00:43:05.932 --> 00:43:08.810
Considered a ten-minute break.

363
00:43:08.893 --> 00:43:12.021
It does not mean
quarters of an hour ago!

364
00:43:16.818 --> 00:43:19.821
- Mr. Garcia. 
- Say Manny only.

365
00:43:19.904 --> 00:43:23.533
Okay, Manny. Listen.

366
00:43:23.616 --> 00:43:27.161
You go straight to the point. Like me.

367
00:43:27.245 --> 00:43:34.127
It is my duty to say
that the Avatar needs more rage.

368
00:43:34.210 --> 00:43:37.922
You're a gang member and a murderer.

369
00:43:38.006 --> 00:43:41.968
Viewers must see the rage. 
Otherwise they will not be afraid.

370
00:43:42.051 --> 00:43:47.098
You are face to face with the competitor. 
You want to scare him.

371
00:43:47.182 --> 00:43:51.102
You need to flail your hands.

372
00:43:51.186 --> 00:43:56.399
You can scream and poke him with a finger. 
Nudge although a little breast.

373
00:43:56.482 --> 00:44:01.571
Viewers do not be afraid,
if only looking at your opponent.

374
00:44:01.654 --> 00:44:05.491
I'll tell you this, because I
believe that you have a potential.

375
00:44:05.575 --> 00:44:12.290
Trust me. If I do not afraid
of you, the public can not be afraid.

376
00:44:13.708 --> 00:44:16.419
Barking dogs belong to far.

377
00:44:16.502 --> 00:44:20.089
Why uhkailisin type, which is my way?

378
00:44:20.173 --> 00:44:23.801
If he does not respect
me, väännän him node -

379
00:44:23.885 --> 00:44:26.763
by taking from him everything
that is important to him.

380
00:44:26.846 --> 00:44:32.936
Then I'll go after him. 
When I get him, and he prays to die.

381
00:44:34.812 --> 00:44:38.066
It's real. I'm acting.

382
00:44:39.692 --> 00:44:45.156
Tell him to describe the near -

383
00:44:45.240 --> 00:44:48.743
and let me make my case.

384
00:44:48.826 --> 00:44:51.579
You are right.

385
00:44:51.663 --> 00:44:55.166
You are genuine. 
Therefore, the fastener you.

386
00:44:57.418 --> 00:44:59.587
Do me a favor.

387
00:44:59.671 --> 00:45:04.259
Return to Trailer and practice
the scene, according to my counsel.

388
00:45:04.342 --> 00:45:08.805
For a moment only. 
We practice with the other guy -

389
00:45:08.888 --> 00:45:12.433
when the cameras are still in place. 
I want to see how he reacts.

390
00:45:12.517 --> 00:45:17.146
- It does not look like the real thing. 
- No worries. Cameras are then transferred.

391
00:45:17.230 --> 00:45:21.359
Then we describe a
scene the way you do.

392
00:45:21.442 --> 00:45:25.071
Source for ten minutes. 
Then we describe.

393
00:45:25.154 --> 00:45:28.157
In fact, for six minutes.

394
00:45:28.241 --> 00:45:32.161
Terrible, angry, mad.

395
00:45:32.245 --> 00:45:35.874
- You scared him. 
- Some days are better than others.

396
00:45:40.336 --> 00:45:45.091
Shoot, when I say: "Practicing the beginning."

397
00:45:46.718 --> 00:45:50.180
It was scary. Too scary to watch it.

398
00:45:50.263 --> 00:45:52.640
Juice. I want juice.

399
00:45:53.892 --> 00:45:57.979
Say it Angiellekin. 
You make the decisions.

400
00:45:58.062 --> 00:46:02.108
He is sometimes right. 
More often than wrong.

401
00:46:02.192 --> 00:46:06.696
He just grind on how I and
my friends are on our way suckers.

402
00:46:06.779 --> 00:46:11.618
But this bus ... No. 
This limousine is the way to Hollywood mirrien creates.

403
00:46:12.827 --> 00:46:16.706
Take it easy. The
world is hard and cruel.

404
00:46:16.789 --> 00:46:20.126
Without training you stay howling moon.

405
00:46:20.210 --> 00:46:24.422
You know what happens when
a group of bored howling?

406
00:46:24.505 --> 00:46:27.592
Banshee is stopped.

407
00:46:33.097 --> 00:46:35.141
Naughty girl.

408
00:46:35.225 --> 00:46:37.977
I will come soon. 
Do not start without me.

409
00:46:38.061 --> 00:46:40.647
What did you talk howling? 
Can you get him, do you?

410
00:46:40.730 --> 00:46:44.442
- Perhaps. 
- You need to learn to share.

411
00:46:44.526 --> 00:46:47.695
Women want to be governed.

412
00:46:47.779 --> 00:46:51.783
- They do not tolerate weakness. 
- I realize. Self-confidence.

413
00:46:51.866 --> 00:46:54.327
And continuous movement.

414
00:46:55.495 --> 00:46:59.749
Haikin die if it stops swimming in water.

415
00:46:59.832 --> 00:47:05.088
Hollywood is a different world than el
barrio, but both are full of sharks.

416
00:47:05.171 --> 00:47:08.049
I, Norman and Jose,
we have swum a little.

417
00:47:08.132 --> 00:47:12.554
What about your sister? he seeing anyone? 
He will never tell you anything.

418
00:47:12.637 --> 00:47:14.973
He has high standards, believe it or not.

419
00:47:15.056 --> 00:47:17.767
It is a good thing.

420
00:47:17.851 --> 00:47:21.187
He is smart, and
it scares full of guys.

421
00:47:22.730 --> 00:47:27.026
He can not worry about the fact
that it found some pregnant white kundille.

422
00:47:27.110 --> 00:47:30.905
He becomes only the bitter,
if he area to have fun.

423
00:47:30.989 --> 00:47:33.741
He will only make it work.

424
00:47:33.825 --> 00:47:37.078
- Working is good. 
- Between the need to have fun.

425
00:47:37.161 --> 00:47:40.039
And to strike women.

426
00:47:42.166 --> 00:47:45.295
You are nicely decorated, Manny.

427
00:47:49.173 --> 00:47:53.011
- Wait outside. 
- Do not need to. 
We are a family.

428
00:47:53.094 --> 00:47:55.430
Right.

429
00:47:55.513 --> 00:47:58.725
He is about time
to get to know us.

430
00:48:01.269 --> 00:48:05.023
Get me a soda. No hurry.

431
00:48:11.112 --> 00:48:14.949
We've missed you. 
The family needs to keep in touch.

432
00:48:15.033 --> 00:48:17.410
Täälläpä homely smells.

433
00:48:19.287 --> 00:48:22.165
You are always as much fun.

434
00:48:22.248 --> 00:48:26.586
- There is also a shit storm. 
- I'm not against the wind.

435
00:48:29.297 --> 00:48:32.133
You are right. 
He is the right man for the job.

436
00:48:45.563 --> 00:48:48.525
I know you're up there!

437
00:49:08.044 --> 00:49:11.881
- You're smart, you want to be. 
- It fell by only half a point.

438
00:49:11.965 --> 00:49:15.885
Have fallen B C student's student. 
What is going on?

439
00:49:15.969 --> 00:49:20.014
- Nothing. 
- How comfortable I can help you?

440
00:49:21.015 --> 00:49:26.062
Your formula are formed now. 
Modify the future.

441
00:49:26.145 --> 00:49:28.898
Who cares the future?

442
00:49:28.982 --> 00:49:33.111
If I live now, I live ever.

443
00:49:33.194 --> 00:49:36.948
- Sounds like your uncle jutuilta. 
- He may be right.

444
00:49:37.031 --> 00:49:42.036
I do not feel like a slave
for 50 years, when mimmit run over, -

445
00:49:42.120 --> 00:49:46.082
and then worry about the
lost lives of other old beards.

446
00:49:46.165 --> 00:49:51.546
He was released a year ago. 
Number began to fall, and you will not show up at home.

447
00:49:51.629 --> 00:49:55.967
- Does he try to train you? 
- You do not know anything.

448
00:49:56.050 --> 00:50:00.263
He does not want to repeat his mistakes. 
He tells you to listen to you.

449
00:50:00.346 --> 00:50:04.642
- I see that you are listening to. 
- You know only what you think you see an.

450
00:50:05.894 --> 00:50:10.356
- You're young. 
I'm just trying to help. 
- Will? You do not know me.

451
00:50:10.440 --> 00:50:13.526
- You want that I am the same as you. 
- You have a son.

452
00:50:13.610 --> 00:50:17.780
Of which grows up in man. 
Enoasi track, which is a man.

453
00:50:17.864 --> 00:50:22.076
We are not with their mother may have
similar role models, and he has good intentions.

454
00:50:22.160 --> 00:50:25.371
He is, however, what is.

455
00:50:25.455 --> 00:50:30.752
I do not want that his style of
life cling to you. So it can be.

456
00:50:30.835 --> 00:50:34.505
You will not go shooting,
before the number to get better.

457
00:50:34.589 --> 00:50:38.593
- What? 
- You get to meet Mannya the right place.

458
00:50:38.676 --> 00:50:40.428
- That is here. 
- Yes.

459
00:50:40.511 --> 00:50:45.558
- Why can not I go to his place of employment. 
- Hollywood money is the most important thing.

460
00:50:45.642 --> 00:50:48.561
It glorifies crime, violence, sex and drugs.

461
00:50:48.645 --> 00:50:53.274
It looks of the
comrades uneducated, gang members, -

462
00:50:53.358 --> 00:50:56.819
peasants, immigrants, and such.

463
00:50:56.903 --> 00:51:02.075
If the prison does not count, it
is the worst place to get role models.

464
00:51:37.402 --> 00:51:40.989
He was Candy Oklahoma City.

465
00:51:41.072 --> 00:51:44.117
Remember to give the girls a tip.

466
00:51:44.200 --> 00:51:46.744
Next Nightingale.

467
00:51:51.124 --> 00:51:53.751
The record time.

468
00:51:55.587 --> 00:51:59.924
I hope you do not have enemies. 
You're getting predictable.

469
00:52:00.925 --> 00:52:04.137
I thought you were sometimes amusing. 
It has indeed been a long time.

470
00:52:05.555 --> 00:52:08.683
- Perhaps you crave a drink. 
- I do not laughing.

471
00:52:10.185 --> 00:52:13.104
And I'm joking. 
I'll have a new one.

472
00:52:18.484 --> 00:52:23.114
It is said that the
convicted man's last visits All -

473
00:52:23.198 --> 00:52:26.743
nostalgic place where he became man.

474
00:52:30.580 --> 00:52:34.626
Where you took the first step
and then a thousand paces, -

475
00:52:34.709 --> 00:52:37.795
which can only lead to one place.

476
00:52:37.879 --> 00:52:40.173
Now you have arrived.

477
00:52:40.256 --> 00:52:42.800
Do not judge, that you be not judged.

478
00:52:45.720 --> 00:52:48.264
We had a deal.

479
00:52:50.350 --> 00:52:53.019
What now? Did the cat take your tongue?

480
00:52:53.102 --> 00:52:59.400
Only a dreamer believes, that
the blind hunting dog stops barking.

481
00:52:59.484 --> 00:53:02.862
I see everything.

482
00:53:02.946 --> 00:53:08.451
And even a blind dog can
smell the shit in your own backyard.

483
00:53:09.536 --> 00:53:13.665
Just you and me. 
Think carefully still.

484
00:53:18.294 --> 00:53:22.215
What the script reads, Hollywood? 
Or do not you remember?

485
00:53:23.675 --> 00:53:27.178
See poliisivideoitasi more detail.

486
00:53:27.262 --> 00:53:31.182
Mr. Hollywood describes the important close-up tomorrow.

487
00:53:31.266 --> 00:53:36.896
My eyes do not swell
with tears that pour hurt you.

488
00:53:37.981 --> 00:53:40.525
Fight over a second day.

489
00:54:27.780 --> 00:54:32.327
- How long they are asleep? 
- I do not know. 
Movie started at 20.

490
00:54:34.662 --> 00:54:37.415
He's just proud of.

491
00:54:38.875 --> 00:54:43.421
Night owl goes to bed at 20
on the third night in a row.

492
00:54:43.504 --> 00:54:46.341
This is about more.

493
00:54:46.424 --> 00:54:49.719
- I do not want that he dislikes me. 
- He just wants to be a man.

494
00:54:49.802 --> 00:54:55.433
I also want it. 
Sometimes it seems that the measures vice versa.

495
00:54:56.434 --> 00:54:59.354
I'm just tired.

496
00:54:59.437 --> 00:55:02.899
I know, sweetie.

497
00:55:02.982 --> 00:55:05.610
And I'm proud of you.

498
00:55:08.905 --> 00:55:12.158
Thank you mother. 
Work and school ...

499
00:55:12.242 --> 00:55:15.411
You're a good role model Juanito.

500
00:55:15.495 --> 00:55:20.667
- I hope so. 
- I will handle this. You rest.

501
00:55:20.750 --> 00:55:24.796
No dice. The sauce will
need to get the campfire tonight.

502
00:55:24.879 --> 00:55:27.257
Can you take Diana's sleep?

503
00:55:44.023 --> 00:55:47.110
No one knows what the future holds.

504
00:55:48.111 --> 00:55:51.281
But we all see our past.

505
00:55:51.364 --> 00:55:55.660
All the joys and sorrows, gains
and losses in the middle -

506
00:55:56.870 --> 00:56:00.748
One thing shines brightly. Family.

507
00:56:01.958 --> 00:56:07.463
If you betray his family, works
against the blood of the law.

508
00:56:48.755 --> 00:56:51.299
What kind of grades you received?

509
00:56:52.800 --> 00:56:55.929
- Dessert? 
- It's good to eat.

510
00:56:56.012 --> 00:56:57.764
I'll take.

511
00:57:00.517 --> 00:57:03.978
- What is your mother put us? 
- It is a surprise.

512
00:57:04.062 --> 00:57:07.857
- Or is it a surprise. 
- I like surprises.

513
00:57:16.282 --> 00:57:19.369
- Excuse me. 
- Thank you.

514
00:57:19.452 --> 00:57:23.456
- I'm sorry I laughed. 
- Shame, Manny.

515
00:57:23.540 --> 00:57:27.252
- That was a spontaneous reaction. 
- He has been in the kitchen all day.

516
00:57:27.335 --> 00:57:30.338
I'm sorry, but I
refuse to be ashamed of.

517
00:57:30.421 --> 00:57:35.593
- You do not have to excuse me. 
- Have I been to thee?

518
00:57:35.677 --> 00:57:38.179
- Was it funny? 
- Guess what.

519
00:57:38.263 --> 00:57:43.101
- The atmosphere is incredibly tight. 
- Do not start, Manny.

520
00:57:43.184 --> 00:57:46.145
It my imagination, or are you always angry?

521
00:57:46.229 --> 00:57:48.898
Although I did not laugh, 
I'm still not angry.

522
00:57:48.982 --> 00:57:51.609
- I did not even come for the food. 
- Why then?

523
00:57:51.693 --> 00:57:54.904
I want to be with Juan.

524
00:57:54.988 --> 00:57:57.866
Your rules, if you remember.

525
00:58:06.416 --> 00:58:11.546
- Cleaning up our table. 
- Let's do it.

526
00:58:15.425 --> 00:58:18.720
Do not you understand
what I'm trying to do?

527
00:58:18.803 --> 00:58:21.931
- Go back in. 
- I do not. We need to talk.

528
00:58:23.725 --> 00:58:26.436
You need to respect me.

529
00:58:27.604 --> 00:58:30.732
You can not solve problems with violence.

530
00:58:30.815 --> 00:58:34.861
I want him to be the best. 
I can teach him things.

531
00:58:34.944 --> 00:58:37.238
- What's that? 
- I can teach him to laugh.

532
00:58:37.322 --> 00:58:40.408
Is the life a joke?

533
00:58:40.491 --> 00:58:44.662
- Juan's ratings are falling. 
- Is it my fault?

534
00:58:44.746 --> 00:58:48.875
- Is. Listen to me. 
- I'm not listening.

535
00:58:48.958 --> 00:58:51.836
Do you think that
I would like him myself?

536
00:58:51.920 --> 00:58:55.340
I do not wish it to anyone. 
But I had no choice.

537
00:58:55.423 --> 00:58:58.635
Bullshit. Everyone has.

538
00:58:58.718 --> 00:59:02.555
Easy for you to say. 
You're smart, beautiful ...

539
00:59:02.639 --> 00:59:05.433
- You were smart. 
- I'm not in school.

540
00:59:05.517 --> 00:59:09.229
- Do not constantly make excuses for. 
- I can not think that.

541
00:59:09.312 --> 00:59:12.023
Yes biscuits.

542
00:59:12.106 --> 00:59:15.235
The awe may not be required. 
It must be earned.

543
00:59:15.318 --> 00:59:18.780
In your world can use his head.

544
00:59:18.863 --> 00:59:23.201
- Here you are required fists. 
- Is that what the world hoped for Juan?

545
00:59:23.284 --> 00:59:26.496
- I did not ask for this. 
- That's what I mean.

546
00:59:26.579 --> 00:59:30.250
If we do not change
the world, who will do it?

547
00:59:30.333 --> 00:59:34.921
- What you want from me? 
- Juan did not get to see just violence.

548
00:59:35.004 --> 00:59:39.050
You're a woman. 
You do not understand what it is like to be a man.

549
00:59:39.133 --> 00:59:41.970
We are a competitive-minded. We compete.

550
00:59:42.053 --> 00:59:45.348
It was then playing cash or fists.

551
00:59:45.431 --> 00:59:49.853
Do we not able to compete with
the white man's world, yet at the time.

552
00:59:49.936 --> 00:59:52.856
That is, hares and choose the easy route?

553
00:59:52.939 --> 00:59:57.318
Hakkaatko a white man to get respect?

554
00:59:57.402 --> 01:00:00.280
Is it worth the prize prison?

555
01:00:00.363 --> 01:00:04.033
A coward dies a thousand times. Ask Veritas.

556
01:00:04.117 --> 01:00:09.914
We had two options. 
The police or criminal career.

557
01:00:09.998 --> 01:00:13.459
And believe me, 
I had my options more difficult.

558
01:00:17.088 --> 01:00:20.592
Do not worry, babe. 
I'm outta here.

559
01:00:58.087 --> 01:01:02.175
If I nurkillani turned the other cheek, -

560
01:01:02.258 --> 01:01:05.595
received only the first melodious bruise.

561
01:01:07.805 --> 01:01:11.100
Violence was everywhere.

562
01:01:11.184 --> 01:01:14.270
When I got home
and opened the telly -

563
01:01:14.354 --> 01:01:17.524
saw more of the same.

564
01:01:18.733 --> 01:01:23.780
When you get back often enough,
will do anything to make it disappear.

565
01:01:27.325 --> 01:01:33.081
Only after joining the gang realizes
that the choice affects all around.

566
01:01:36.751 --> 01:01:42.298
The loss of loved ones happens
a thousand times more than any spanking.

567
01:01:42.382 --> 01:01:45.927
And then it is ready to sacrifice
everything in order to get things corrected.

568
01:01:57.272 --> 01:02:00.942
Come back, assholes!

569
01:02:03.736 --> 01:02:08.783
Are these not the Norman and Jose? 
I thought that they are friends.

570
01:02:11.411 --> 01:02:16.541
In the case of the
girls, yes they are sufficient.

571
01:02:16.624 --> 01:02:19.669
Look at me when I'm talking to you.

572
01:02:19.752 --> 01:02:22.755
It is said that the calves of friends.

573
01:02:22.839 --> 01:02:25.550
You would do that. Would you?

574
01:02:25.633 --> 01:02:28.136
Depends on who you ask.

575
01:02:28.219 --> 01:02:34.434
I told only a pair
of Hollywood-producer of my life.

576
01:02:35.476 --> 01:02:39.272
I do not about money. 
I just wanted to tell you the truth.

577
01:02:39.355 --> 01:02:42.108
The film is based on true events?

578
01:02:42.192 --> 01:02:46.070
The prison supreme types think that the calves.

579
01:02:46.154 --> 01:02:52.327
They think that factor in business. 
I did not tell any details.

580
01:02:53.620 --> 01:02:56.206
My believed in breach of the rules.

581
01:02:56.289 --> 01:02:59.250
But they only come
up with their own regulations.

582
01:02:59.334 --> 01:03:03.713
Same thing here. decision-making positions
will come up with the rules.

583
01:03:05.131 --> 01:03:08.843
- What happens now? 
-Minulleko? Nothing.

584
01:03:10.637 --> 01:03:15.058
Enosi survives everything, what they come up with.

585
01:03:16.184 --> 01:03:18.603
Did you do this for me?

586
01:03:19.979 --> 01:03:24.526
I'm proud of you, but I
do not want you feel like it.

587
01:03:24.609 --> 01:03:28.279
You need to get yourself a better life.

588
01:03:31.491 --> 01:03:35.495
I owe you a shirt. 
What the hell?

589
01:03:35.578 --> 01:03:38.456
Oh, brother, Juan.

590
01:03:38.540 --> 01:03:41.876
Now they own a piece of you.

591
01:03:53.596 --> 01:03:57.725
"All thirst for life, for
which they can not afford."

592
01:03:57.809 --> 01:04:00.979
It is a song verse.

593
01:04:01.062 --> 01:04:06.109
It is not related in any
way to money, riches or poverty.

594
01:04:10.488 --> 01:04:15.285
Healthy. You look at a man who has
spent a long time in the desert without water.

595
01:04:15.368 --> 01:04:18.246
- Damn. 
- Nice to see you again.

596
01:04:18.329 --> 01:04:21.374
- Is this good? 
- It will be even better.

597
01:04:21.457 --> 01:04:25.962
I'll take you now
frequent contact, so be ready.

598
01:04:29.340 --> 01:04:33.303
Think although telly. 
Life is exciting.

599
01:04:35.597 --> 01:04:37.974
Life is like Disneyland.

600
01:04:38.057 --> 01:04:41.060
Until the telly closes.

601
01:04:41.144 --> 01:04:43.771
Open the trunk.

602
01:04:47.275 --> 01:04:49.861
Out of the car.

603
01:04:56.951 --> 01:04:59.245
- Email this. 
- A fine coat.

604
01:04:59.329 --> 01:05:02.540
Shut up. Export letter to that mailbox.

605
01:05:31.319 --> 01:05:35.365
Let it go. Start the car. 
Step on it now!

606
01:05:48.670 --> 01:05:51.798
If Manny could testify, he would be released.

607
01:05:51.881 --> 01:05:55.677
- I do not get it. Manny died. 
- If Juan did not know robbery, -

608
01:05:55.760 --> 01:05:59.305
He is also not designed for it.

609
01:05:59.389 --> 01:06:01.808
I do not understand.

610
01:06:01.891 --> 01:06:06.646
Case Michele Jordan. 
Michele kuskasi boyfriend and his friends.

611
01:06:06.729 --> 01:06:11.776
Boyfriend was hungry. 
Stop by the restaurant's house. 
We are looking for something.

612
01:06:11.860 --> 01:06:16.698
However, keep the car running. 
We take food by. 
They ransacked the place.

613
01:06:16.781 --> 01:06:21.786
They came out and jumped into the car. 
The boyfriend told Michele to run.

614
01:06:21.870 --> 01:06:27.458
She was domineering and physically
stronger MICHEL, so Michele obeyed.

615
01:06:27.542 --> 01:06:31.754
Do you think it was
part of the plan for Manny?

616
01:06:31.838 --> 01:06:35.091
I know that Manny
Muertos gang was behind Manny.

617
01:06:35.174 --> 01:06:38.803
Manny was nothing more than bait. 
The guy took the money.

618
01:06:38.887 --> 01:06:42.307
Why did he messed up the yuan it?

619
01:06:42.390 --> 01:06:44.726
Manny was a ticking time bomb.

620
01:06:44.809 --> 01:06:48.229
He believed that to live to 30 years. 
Or 40 or 50 years old.

621
01:06:48.313 --> 01:06:53.109
How kind you can manage? 
Starting after their families.

622
01:06:53.193 --> 01:06:57.989
It's no secret that the life sentence
dominate the streets in such a way.

623
01:06:58.072 --> 01:07:01.326
Sergeant Veritas know everything Muertos.

624
01:07:01.409 --> 01:07:04.787
He lived as a
child next door to Manny.

625
01:07:04.871 --> 01:07:08.625
I know, Manny was dating her mother.

626
01:07:10.919 --> 01:07:14.589
I should have guessed. 
They are the same corners.

627
01:07:16.299 --> 01:07:19.469
This may be good news.

628
01:07:22.722 --> 01:07:25.600
I need to go. I'll
walk you to the car.

629
01:07:25.683 --> 01:07:29.812
- Thank you for agreeing to this meeting. 
- You're welcome.

630
01:07:29.896 --> 01:07:33.650
I was anyway have to meet repeat customers.

631
01:08:46.222 --> 01:08:49.684
Approaching the gates of heaven, Al. 
I need an answer.

632
01:08:49.767 --> 01:08:52.687
The offer is valid
only up to the door.

633
01:08:52.770 --> 01:08:56.816
The offer is one-way
ticket to hell without compassion.

634
01:08:56.900 --> 01:09:00.570
Compassion? abandonment of prosecutions would be merciful.

635
01:09:00.653 --> 01:09:04.282
Facts destroying son. 
You know I do not want it.

636
01:09:04.365 --> 01:09:08.077
Is five and ten years for something different?

637
01:09:08.161 --> 01:09:11.873
He becomes a half
years society of ignorance victim.

638
01:09:11.956 --> 01:09:14.709
I admire your idealism -

639
01:09:14.792 --> 01:09:18.838
but you do not think rationally,
because you want to help the boy.

640
01:09:18.922 --> 01:09:21.716
The thing is clear as day.

641
01:09:21.799 --> 01:09:25.929
If we receive the annulment of the
evidence of belonging to a gang, -

642
01:09:26.012 --> 01:09:29.974
the obvious thing to sink into
the swamp, which it is built.

643
01:09:30.058 --> 01:09:33.061
I know that you hate
when I do so -

644
01:09:33.144 --> 01:09:36.439
but A princes drove off
the scene of the crime -

645
01:09:36.523 --> 01:09:41.361
ride back with his uncle, who waved
one site CoR was only seconds before.

646
01:09:41.444 --> 01:09:44.322
B: dead uncle, an accomplice, -

647
01:09:44.405 --> 01:09:48.451
the only person capable of annulment
of the story, is Muertos leaders.

648
01:09:48.535 --> 01:09:51.246
C princes ignorance is not credible -

649
01:09:51.329 --> 01:09:55.166
because the uncle took the
gun up against the rulers.

650
01:09:55.250 --> 01:09:58.211
D: princes motive was money.

651
01:09:58.294 --> 01:10:02.215
Monthly payroll on one site always waiting
for the last day of the month.

652
01:10:03.800 --> 01:10:09.138
You have gifts of
customer service answering machine tone.

653
01:10:09.222 --> 01:10:12.725
A preliminary treatment spawned more questions than answers.

654
01:10:12.809 --> 01:10:16.688
B: other accomplices are on
the loose with the money.

655
01:10:16.771 --> 01:10:19.691
C: You've just been informed about this.

656
01:10:19.774 --> 01:10:24.070
And D are afraid that I
pull an ace on the sleeve -

657
01:10:24.153 --> 01:10:28.283
and an affront to you when you
do not manage to overcome all self-evident juttuasi.

658
01:10:38.376 --> 01:10:42.130
We may have a problem. 
It would be good if the Veritas would be here.

659
01:10:42.213 --> 01:10:45.466
The referee will return after ten minutes.

660
01:10:45.550 --> 01:10:49.053
Would you like to post Malibu?

661
01:10:57.812 --> 01:11:01.232
Good afternoon everyone.

662
01:11:01.316 --> 01:11:04.360
Defence has requested to encrypt -

663
01:11:04.444 --> 01:11:08.865
the trial of the accused gang connections.

664
01:11:08.948 --> 01:11:12.660
I want the jury hears the evidence.

665
01:11:12.744 --> 01:11:16.706
Act 402 the number of law -

666
01:11:16.789 --> 01:11:20.210
to tell the grounds of the judgment.

667
01:11:20.293 --> 01:11:26.007
Sergeant Veritas opinion on the preliminary reading -

668
01:11:26.090 --> 01:11:30.136
provide sufficient grounds for the adoption of evidence.

669
01:11:30.220 --> 01:11:32.680
Prosecutor?

670
01:11:32.764 --> 01:11:37.227
Madam Judge. The prosecution
would like to stress -

671
01:11:37.310 --> 01:11:40.563
the gravity of the action
brought against Mr Garcia indictment -

672
01:11:40.647 --> 01:11:44.275
in terms of catch four
million still missing to be.

673
01:11:44.359 --> 01:11:48.655
The prosecutor also wants to point out that Mr. 
Garcia is unwilling -

674
01:11:48.738 --> 01:11:54.536
to share information about
the robbery of other factors.

675
01:11:54.619 --> 01:11:59.541
I refer to the sergeant Veritas
opinion of a confidentiality provision -

676
01:11:59.624 --> 01:12:04.546
on the 5th Street Muertos initaatioriitin undergone.

677
01:12:04.629 --> 01:12:07.173
Anything else?

678
01:12:08.341 --> 01:12:10.802
- Where is Veritas? 
- I do not know.

679
01:12:10.885 --> 01:12:13.680
I have asked four times. 
You know belongs.

680
01:12:24.858 --> 01:12:26.734
That's all.

681
01:12:26.818 --> 01:12:30.488
Mr. Hartford. I assume that
you want to say something.

682
01:12:30.572 --> 01:12:33.366
Yes, Your Honor.

683
01:12:33.449 --> 01:12:39.122
The prosecutor spoke very impressively speculative evidence.

684
01:12:39.205 --> 01:12:43.334
I can not speak on behalf
of the judge, but I feel refreshed.

685
01:12:43.418 --> 01:12:49.757
I would not forgive myself if
this evidence can be considered as self-evident.

686
01:12:49.841 --> 01:12:53.303
- Carry on. 
- I rely on reasoning.

687
01:12:53.386 --> 01:12:57.515
Would it be a gang of evidence
weight of evidence of more judgment than himself?

688
01:12:57.599 --> 01:13:01.186
The word "gang" echoed in the mind
of the jury throughout the trial -

689
01:13:01.269 --> 01:13:04.355
and would affect all the other evidence.

690
01:13:04.439 --> 01:13:09.152
It causes the bias but does not
say anything about the guilt of the accused.

691
01:13:09.235 --> 01:13:14.032
The word "gang" and latinotausta make
him guilty, contrary to the evidence.

692
01:13:14.115 --> 01:13:20.121
I guess that defenses are "in
the wrong place at the wrong time".

693
01:13:20.205 --> 01:13:25.543
The accused fled the scene of the crime and
sentenced to ride back with a criminal gang leader.

694
01:13:25.627 --> 01:13:29.380
It tells us something, 
I think guilt.

695
01:13:29.464 --> 01:13:34.260
Your Honor, our environment
and our experiences shape us.

696
01:13:34.344 --> 01:13:40.099
Juan believed that my uncle had
come across the old enemies, and fled.

697
01:13:40.183 --> 01:13:45.563
The right to rely on gang expert's conclusions.

698
01:13:45.647 --> 01:13:49.692
The boy grew up
without a father figure, -

699
01:13:49.776 --> 01:13:53.279
and he admired enoaan, which trusted blindly.

700
01:13:53.363 --> 01:13:58.243
Sergeant Veritas can also confirm -

701
01:13:58.326 --> 01:14:04.582
that Manny had left
Muertos work as an actor.

702
01:14:04.666 --> 01:14:07.752
He was a respected actress.

703
01:14:07.835 --> 01:14:13.258
The whole neighborhood knew about it. 
Why would he be pushed Juan was down that path?

704
01:14:14.634 --> 01:14:18.388
The Heads drove the
getaway car after the robbery.

705
01:14:18.471 --> 01:14:21.766
If you have evidence of life change -

706
01:14:21.850 --> 01:14:25.770
they tell the jury.

707
01:14:25.854 --> 01:14:28.565
That's what I intend to do.

708
01:14:28.648 --> 01:14:35.029
But if the slender figure of gang life created
by the Jury are indoctrinated in the media, -

709
01:14:35.113 --> 01:14:39.033
my client is seen as
a movie set-wielding figure -

710
01:14:39.117 --> 01:14:41.911
and the dazed teenager,
like the one he has.

711
01:14:41.995 --> 01:14:45.832
Principals have only one tattoo.

712
01:14:45.915 --> 01:14:51.337
It connects him to the
gang, led by his uncle.

713
01:14:51.421 --> 01:14:54.757
The tattoo was a day old,
when the robbery was carried out.

714
01:14:54.841 --> 01:14:59.387
And Juan tattooing is just a tombstone. 
No Muertos symbols.

715
01:14:59.470 --> 01:15:04.851
Without it, the member shall not contents
first, that is, coming up with ghosts.

716
01:15:04.934 --> 01:15:08.271
Sergeant Veritas testified that
the gang want to -

717
01:15:08.354 --> 01:15:12.609
committing serious crimes and increase
its position in the gang.

718
01:15:12.692 --> 01:15:15.737
Sergeant Veritas can also prove -

719
01:15:15.820 --> 01:15:21.618
that without the symbols of
high-level crimes can not participate.

720
01:15:21.701 --> 01:15:27.540
We have the E-card, which proves that
the accused has access to the same gang.

721
01:15:27.624 --> 01:15:30.543
Madam Judge. What would
happen if a child -

722
01:15:30.627 --> 01:15:34.797
11 to 12-year-old is said
to deny the connection Muertos -

723
01:15:34.881 --> 01:15:37.133
in consultation with their friends?

724
01:15:37.217 --> 01:15:41.930
In this area of ​​the brain
are not respected, but the muscles.

725
01:15:42.013 --> 01:15:45.975
Our power is in our
world intellect and economical strength.

726
01:15:46.059 --> 01:15:51.064
- In their world of physical strength. 
- This is the sociology, not legal issues.

727
01:15:52.190 --> 01:15:57.111
I am different from
us that economic efforts -

728
01:15:57.195 --> 01:16:00.698
do not apply to
those whose-economic resources are limited.

729
01:16:00.782 --> 01:16:05.662
The economic aspiration is quite
different from a bank robbery.

730
01:16:07.747 --> 01:16:11.417
Once again, the sergeant testified Veritas -

731
01:16:11.501 --> 01:16:16.506
Bank robbery to be a
common way to fund gang activity.

732
01:16:16.589 --> 01:16:19.092
If you just want to
gangs of easy money -

733
01:16:19.175 --> 01:16:23.054
a flock of gorgeous girls in
mini-skirts and falskeissa smiles waiting for -

734
01:16:23.137 --> 01:16:28.643
Polo Lounge Veritas sergeant
and his unit appear '.

735
01:16:30.144 --> 01:16:35.400
Mr. Hartford. Defense representation to
conceal the evidence is denied.

736
01:16:39.988 --> 01:16:44.534
In court, not to engage in
a philosophical debate about human nature.

737
01:16:44.617 --> 01:16:47.745
Yes underway. Prejudices are common opinions.

738
01:16:47.829 --> 01:16:52.000
Blue bandanna on a black
man in Compton means Cripin members.

739
01:16:52.083 --> 01:16:56.004
- Turban Arab inhabitants of mean terrorists. 
- The representative!

740
01:16:57.171 --> 01:17:00.800
Defense representation to conceal the evidence is denied.

741
01:17:02.218 --> 01:17:04.596
I've made my decision.

742
01:17:04.679 --> 01:17:10.768
If the jury is of the opinion that
this young man is pedannut his bed, -

743
01:17:11.853 --> 01:17:16.733
it is only fair that
she lay there for some time.

744
01:17:17.775 --> 01:17:20.862
If not, he is free to leave.

745
01:17:21.988 --> 01:17:24.949
So the system works.

746
01:17:35.877 --> 01:17:38.796
They do not worry
about it, I made it.

747
01:17:38.880 --> 01:17:42.967
Real culprits can not
be found, so I slated.

748
01:17:43.051 --> 01:17:45.720
- It is not that simple. 
- It is.

749
01:17:45.803 --> 01:17:49.766
Manny was right. 
Gringos invented all the time new rules.

750
01:17:49.849 --> 01:17:53.645
- Gringos? 
- They are afraid, and we pressed down.

751
01:17:53.728 --> 01:17:58.900
The system weighs us down at
all times, and you muscle men -

752
01:17:58.983 --> 01:18:02.237
bear with it rather
than against the way down.

753
01:18:02.320 --> 01:18:06.616
In order to be hard? Lead in jail?

754
01:18:08.493 --> 01:18:11.788
If Manny would have been
as smart as even strong -

755
01:18:11.871 --> 01:18:15.041
he might not have been the castle.

756
01:18:15.124 --> 01:18:18.419
Really? What could higher education do you have?

757
01:18:18.503 --> 01:18:20.838
You make vague crap days' pay.

758
01:18:20.922 --> 01:18:24.259
Spending your life waiting for you
to be seen as an equal?

759
01:18:24.342 --> 01:18:27.470
You will want to see
just leaning over the water coolers.

760
01:18:27.554 --> 01:18:31.391
Defend even the white guys -

761
01:18:31.474 --> 01:18:35.728
who put you in a
thick and not its responsibility.

762
01:18:35.812 --> 01:18:37.772
Are you finished?

763
01:18:37.856 --> 01:18:41.860
You do not know their
rules, so you have to pretend.

764
01:18:41.943 --> 01:18:45.572
- Some of their rules. 
- You know how to, huh?

765
01:18:45.655 --> 01:18:49.158
Let's say that you get a judgment here.

766
01:18:49.242 --> 01:18:52.453
- Then you're the right tough guy. 
- Hell yeah.

767
01:18:54.289 --> 01:18:58.293
During the first week someone will challenge you.

768
01:18:58.376 --> 01:19:01.880
- What are you doing? 
- I will beat him in the sight of all.

769
01:19:01.963 --> 01:19:04.382
Street rules.

770
01:19:04.465 --> 01:19:08.011
They calved from you. 
You know that.

771
01:19:09.012 --> 01:19:12.265
Aggravated assault.

772
01:19:12.348 --> 01:19:15.977
Another tough guys miss.

773
01:19:16.060 --> 01:19:19.981
Prison time doubles. 
Eight years in the state prison.

774
01:19:20.064 --> 01:19:23.151
Double glazed, it is 16 years.

775
01:19:23.234 --> 01:19:27.822
You will have to sit about
85%, even though kiillottaisit Director of shoes.

776
01:19:29.490 --> 01:19:33.703
California Penal Code punishes the streets of rules.

777
01:19:35.580 --> 01:19:39.042
And if you ever get out -

778
01:19:39.125 --> 01:19:43.463
you do not even spit on the sidewalk
or open beer cans on the street corner.

779
01:19:43.546 --> 01:19:47.425
It would mean a third strikes.

780
01:19:47.508 --> 01:19:51.179
Then you're in trouble. Life.

781
01:20:01.272 --> 01:20:04.484
Man to man on the street -

782
01:20:05.485 --> 01:20:10.782
can not speak for what one wants. 
The words do not matter.

783
01:20:10.865 --> 01:20:14.160
Only deeds.

784
01:20:14.244 --> 01:20:18.456
Skyscrapers in the world must
take into account the structure.

785
01:20:18.540 --> 01:20:22.293
The organization, which is built on ideas.

786
01:20:22.377 --> 01:20:25.129
Ideas are built from words.

787
01:20:25.213 --> 01:20:30.760
It acts will be just as important
as what is said to have made.

788
01:20:42.105 --> 01:20:45.859
I'm getting too middle of next week.

789
01:20:45.942 --> 01:20:49.362
I can then pay the remaining rent.

790
01:20:53.074 --> 01:20:57.787
I need someone qualified who can come
to the scene a couple of times.

791
01:21:00.123 --> 01:21:04.335
I can call the footman, but I
rather someone who knows what to do.

792
01:21:07.755 --> 01:21:11.426
Work at increasing your car by hand?

793
01:21:11.509 --> 01:21:17.348
The works are in the front seat. 
Behind a pillow and a blanket.

794
01:21:20.476 --> 01:21:23.771
- Do you think so? 
- You know what I think.

795
01:21:23.855 --> 01:21:26.941
You are undervalued talent.

796
01:22:02.310 --> 01:22:05.313
Take personal injury.

797
01:22:05.396 --> 01:22:07.690
So human rights.

798
01:22:12.403 --> 01:22:16.741
Both the Criminal Law, which
does not have the money.

799
01:22:16.824 --> 01:22:21.329
- If a criminal success. 
- And then he need a lawyer.

800
01:22:21.412 --> 01:22:23.915
That's right.

801
01:22:31.798 --> 01:22:34.050
Hey.

802
01:22:35.176 --> 01:22:40.056
I have represented Hispanics over 20 years.

803
01:22:40.139 --> 01:22:46.688
I know them. They cut off
their hands rather than sacrifice his pride.

804
01:22:48.857 --> 01:22:52.068
Is this a gang expert,
which you were talking about?

805
01:22:53.319 --> 01:22:57.407
Veritas. Sergeant Veritas -

806
01:22:57.490 --> 01:23:02.954
was 10-12 years old when
my client uncle Manny -

807
01:23:03.037 --> 01:23:08.585
Eva's mother took the Veritas
Veritas 5th Street Muertos party.

808
01:23:08.668 --> 01:23:11.170
Mother shot past the ajavasta car.

809
01:23:13.840 --> 01:23:16.676
Veritas. Truth.

810
01:23:16.759 --> 01:23:20.013
If only his truth the same as ours.

811
01:23:24.893 --> 01:23:28.646
I respect him. Really.

812
01:23:29.647 --> 01:23:33.902
But at stake is the boy's whole life.

813
01:23:33.985 --> 01:23:38.364
A couple of friendly words, a
pair of expert conclusion is less.

814
01:23:38.448 --> 01:23:41.993
The prisons are full of innocent people.

815
01:23:44.787 --> 01:23:48.625
Have you thought about all the
stupid, what we did at his age?

816
01:23:48.708 --> 01:23:51.669
We could be in his place.

817
01:23:51.753 --> 01:23:54.881
And we could have been sentenced
on the basis of the postcode.

818
01:23:54.964 --> 01:23:59.052
That's what we do. 
Here, the loaded gun is a teenage mistake -

819
01:23:59.135 --> 01:24:02.096
there it gets up to life in prison.

820
01:24:02.180 --> 01:24:06.601
What if he is released? 
He returns to the same neighborhood -

821
01:24:06.684 --> 01:24:09.395
and at the same shit. 
Where are we then we have to?

822
01:24:09.479 --> 01:24:12.649
Back to square one. 
Wake up already.

823
01:24:26.079 --> 01:24:28.206
Sorry.

824
01:24:32.293 --> 01:24:35.338
Have you ever wondered -

825
01:24:35.421 --> 01:24:40.009
Why are sent to us immediately
after the adoption of the exam -

826
01:24:40.093 --> 01:24:43.304
a pile of brochures telling about detoxification?

827
01:24:53.815 --> 01:24:56.568
Are you well?

828
01:24:58.111 --> 01:25:00.613
It's a boy ...

829
01:25:03.825 --> 01:25:07.078
- I'm not qualified. 
- You are you.

830
01:25:23.219 --> 01:25:27.307
You're too hard on yourself. 
You always have been.

831
01:25:42.655 --> 01:25:45.241
I would like to ask you a question.

832
01:25:46.284 --> 01:25:48.369
Pyramid.

833
01:25:48.453 --> 01:25:51.998
What is the most important of the stones?

834
01:25:53.958 --> 01:25:56.878
Listen now only.

835
01:25:56.961 --> 01:26:03.092
What is the main pyramid of stones? 
The chief or the bottom?

836
01:26:04.719 --> 01:26:07.263
Neither.

837
01:26:08.556 --> 01:26:10.975
The chief gets all the credit.

838
01:26:12.852 --> 01:26:15.104
But the bottom ...

839
01:26:15.188 --> 01:26:18.441
It is the foundation. Strong.

840
01:26:21.861 --> 01:26:24.948
If it takes off, -

841
01:26:25.031 --> 01:26:27.492
the whole pyramid collapses.

842
01:26:31.538 --> 01:26:33.748
The law is the same.

843
01:26:46.094 --> 01:26:48.805
Mother. I have missed you.

844
01:26:48.888 --> 01:26:52.433
- Juliana said that you will soon. 
- Did?

845
01:26:52.517 --> 01:26:54.936
Quiet Bunny did not have any sure.

846
01:26:55.019 --> 01:26:59.023
Quiet bunny has had too much sun.

847
01:27:00.108 --> 01:27:03.862
- I change clothes. 
Let's play then. 
- When Juan comes home?

848
01:27:09.367 --> 01:27:16.082
Growing slowly. 
You do not have time to be a child, if you cast down all the time.

849
01:27:16.165 --> 01:27:20.837
I'll tell adult things only when it is necessary. 
It's not always fun.

850
01:27:20.920 --> 01:27:24.299
Is Juan lost?

851
01:27:24.382 --> 01:27:26.593
No.

852
01:27:26.676 --> 01:27:30.430
People who do not know him,
they think he did something wrong.

853
01:27:30.513 --> 01:27:33.183
We know that he is not.

854
01:27:34.893 --> 01:27:37.645
Soon they, too, know it.

855
01:27:37.729 --> 01:27:41.566
I can save him. 
I give him the medicine.

856
01:27:41.649 --> 01:27:44.944
It would help if he had a sore. 
But he is not.

857
01:27:45.028 --> 01:27:47.363
He needs a lawyer.

858
01:27:47.447 --> 01:27:51.576
- Is he a Doctor of Law? 
- Is. You are so smart.

859
01:27:52.911 --> 01:27:57.332
If I dream that the law
Doctor to save her, so it really.

860
01:27:59.375 --> 01:28:02.545
I change my clothes and then
I will read you a fairy tale.

861
01:28:02.629 --> 01:28:07.342
- I want to go to sleep. 
- This early? Are you tired?

862
01:28:07.425 --> 01:28:12.138
No. I want to see quickly a
dream, so I can tell you about it.

863
01:28:37.664 --> 01:28:41.209
Faster. That is right.

864
01:28:42.377 --> 01:28:46.339
- What were you doing? 
- Do not worry about it. Jack.

865
01:28:46.422 --> 01:28:50.009
- What has happened? 
- Everything will be allright. 
You do not know anything.

866
01:28:50.093 --> 01:28:52.929
Left.

867
01:28:55.139 --> 01:28:58.935
- I do not get it. 
- This is part of the plan. 
Let me explain yes.

868
01:28:59.018 --> 01:29:02.272
- Speak only the truth. 
- Why?

869
01:29:02.355 --> 01:29:05.483
- I had to. 
- Who made it?

870
01:29:05.567 --> 01:29:08.236
I made this for you.

871
01:29:50.737 --> 01:29:53.990
A striking young woman.

872
01:29:54.073 --> 01:29:58.620
- You seem to be home. 
- I feel ancient.

873
01:30:01.206 --> 01:30:04.042
The most striking Speaking of which ...

874
01:30:04.125 --> 01:30:08.046
You did not come to see the show?

875
01:30:08.129 --> 01:30:10.048
Your neighborhood?

876
01:30:10.131 --> 01:30:13.301
It was. I'm trying to
keep things the same track.

877
01:30:16.179 --> 01:30:20.642
Tulipa quick judgment, or what, the representative?

878
01:30:21.684 --> 01:30:25.146
Tony Sopranolla on Bada Bing.

879
01:30:25.230 --> 01:30:29.359
Coochie Coo seems to Veritas. 
Withstands be proud of.

880
01:30:29.442 --> 01:30:32.529
We are not here
to talk about my motives.

881
01:30:32.612 --> 01:30:37.700
I can not educate every Ivy League -idioottia.

882
01:30:40.036 --> 01:30:44.415
I'm not being sarcastic. 
I admire your position in earnest.

883
01:30:46.251 --> 01:30:50.964
I need a little awareness or
even incomplete information as to the -

884
01:30:51.047 --> 01:30:57.345
which define how to behave in this region.

885
01:31:01.182 --> 01:31:03.852
I like your style.

886
01:31:03.935 --> 01:31:07.939
However, we both know that it
does not mean anything in court.

887
01:31:08.022 --> 01:31:10.358
Let's get straight to the point.

888
01:31:10.441 --> 01:31:15.113
Fact. New members show their claws
pain of facing up the gang hierarchy.

889
01:31:15.196 --> 01:31:17.240
Fact.

890
01:31:17.323 --> 01:31:21.286
Muertos is leading a gang
of bank robbery in the field.

891
01:31:21.369 --> 01:31:24.914
Juan will feel personally.

892
01:31:28.918 --> 01:31:32.463
I am a gang expert, 
I do not the nature of the witness.

893
01:31:32.547 --> 01:31:35.466
Then should go to another home.

894
01:31:35.550 --> 01:31:38.887
That is, one rotten
apple spoils the whole crop?

895
01:31:38.970 --> 01:31:41.931
Angie? His mother? 
Do not they have a role?

896
01:31:42.015 --> 01:31:45.810
- They are women. 
- I know.

897
01:31:48.229 --> 01:31:51.316
I'll tell you how
to work with young people.

898
01:31:51.399 --> 01:31:57.071
For them, can speak mouths and eyes full. 
The most important thing is what they see.

899
01:31:57.155 --> 01:32:00.742
They do not recognize it, but they see
on the basis of class division of the race.

900
01:32:02.577 --> 01:32:07.290
He has a son. He
likes cars, money and women.

901
01:32:09.042 --> 01:32:11.377
How you survived?

902
01:32:12.378 --> 01:32:15.465
- I guess I was lucky. 
- I disagree.

903
01:32:15.548 --> 01:32:20.386
- You are exceptional. 
- I am an ordinary man.

904
01:32:20.470 --> 01:32:25.183
I think you and Manny
are like above the other.

905
01:32:25.266 --> 01:32:30.605
Do not mention our
names in the same sentence.

906
01:32:32.148 --> 01:32:35.860
And kaunasi Mannya to blur your judgment?

907
01:32:35.944 --> 01:32:39.739
You were sometimes friends. 
You're from the same neighborhood.

908
01:32:40.782 --> 01:32:45.537
Two nights before the robbery
Manny came here. Your region.

909
01:32:45.620 --> 01:32:48.831
Do you believe it to be a coincidence?

910
01:32:48.915 --> 01:32:50.917
Fact.

911
01:32:51.000 --> 01:32:56.047
Manny is not standing for the first time
in one site all the money in her arms.

912
01:32:56.130 --> 01:33:00.635
Fact. Manny is always thinking only of himself.

913
01:33:00.718 --> 01:33:05.765
Fact. Muertos is leading a gang
of bank robbery in the field.

914
01:33:05.849 --> 01:33:08.184
Leading.

915
01:33:09.185 --> 01:33:14.691
Fact. Muertos not starting. Fact. 
Manny was waiting for one site to two minutes -

916
01:33:14.774 --> 01:33:17.402
Another factor that got away.

917
01:33:17.485 --> 01:33:22.365
Fact. A postulated with driver, Juan has -

918
01:33:25.326 --> 01:33:28.288
does not even have a driver's license.

919
01:33:30.164 --> 01:33:34.210
Think about the son
they are character traits -

920
01:33:34.294 --> 01:33:38.506
which could make him the victim's own neighborhood.

921
01:33:40.633 --> 01:33:44.470
My job is not to judge.

922
01:33:53.855 --> 01:33:57.692
Hey ago, a representative. 
Do not crash into the tisseihin departure.

923
01:35:15.895 --> 01:35:19.274
Start the car. Come on.

924
01:35:19.357 --> 01:35:21.901
Pedal to the metal!

925
01:35:25.446 --> 01:35:27.574
- Faster. 
- What has happened?

926
01:35:27.657 --> 01:35:30.535
- Everything will be allright. 
- I do not get it.

927
01:35:30.618 --> 01:35:32.662
I did this because of you.

928
01:36:41.356 --> 01:36:43.525
Away from the door.

929
01:36:43.608 --> 01:36:46.653
The door opens.

930
01:36:51.491 --> 01:36:54.577
We are all equal in
the eyes of the law.

931
01:36:57.038 --> 01:37:01.834
Therefore the right balance, which is
holding a woman's eyes are tied.

932
01:37:04.712 --> 01:37:10.552
The argument is not very convincing, when we
talk about the different parts of the city.

933
01:37:12.762 --> 01:37:17.392
What does your future look like if
you had after the first judgment -

934
01:37:17.475 --> 01:37:20.520
University of criminals?

935
01:37:20.603 --> 01:37:22.981
It's ready.

936
01:37:38.288 --> 01:37:40.999
We assume that the law is fair.

937
01:37:42.584 --> 01:37:45.837
We assume that prisons are for criminals.

938
01:37:47.463 --> 01:37:52.176
We assume that bankers
are greedy lawyers and cheats.

939
01:37:52.260 --> 01:37:54.846
That old man driving
a Maserati is rich -

940
01:37:54.929 --> 01:38:01.060
and that pretty blonde next
to her just wants money.

941
01:38:02.353 --> 01:38:05.023
We assume a lot of things.

942
01:38:07.108 --> 01:38:09.777
We see only the surface.

943
01:38:10.987 --> 01:38:14.824
And the assumptions not always been true.

944
01:38:29.214 --> 01:38:33.218
At the end all becomes clear.

945
01:38:33.301 --> 01:38:36.346
At the end of
all of it makes sense.

946
01:38:37.847 --> 01:38:41.851
Open your mind. 
Open your heart.

947
01:38:41.935 --> 01:38:46.397
You shall love your neighbor as yourself.

948
01:38:52.278 --> 01:38:56.324
