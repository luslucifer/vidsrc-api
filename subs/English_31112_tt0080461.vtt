1
00:01:47.281 --> 00:01:49.762
Quiet, everybody.

2
00:01:49.805 --> 00:01:52.069
We have two new students here

3
00:01:52.112 --> 00:01:53.940
that I'd like to have you meet.

4
00:01:53.984 --> 00:01:56.290
They are exchange students from Europe.

5
00:01:56.334 --> 00:01:58.640
It is my great
honor to introduce to you

6
00:01:58.684 --> 00:02:00.555
Babette and Jacques.

7
00:02:00.599 --> 00:02:02.383
Yay! Whoo! Yay!

8
00:02:04.168 --> 00:02:06.170
Babette and Jacques will be spending

9
00:02:06.213 --> 00:02:07.954
two weeks here in America.

10
00:02:07.998 --> 00:02:10.087
As part of this exchange program,

11
00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:12.219
two of our more fortunate,

12
00:02:12.263 --> 00:02:14.526
and I think
most deserving students,


13
00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:16.049
will be going to France.

14
00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:18.443
What's he talking about?

15
00:02:18.486 --> 00:02:20.184
Who's going to France?

16
00:02:20.227 --> 00:02:21.881
The two students from our school

17
00:02:21.925 --> 00:02:23.839
who have been chosen

18
00:02:23.883 --> 00:02:25.363
are Charlie Brown and myself.

19
00:02:25.972 --> 00:02:27.582
Boo! Me?

20
00:02:27.626 --> 00:02:30.107
Hiss! I've been chosen?
Me?


21
00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:31.543
We have accepted this great honor.

22
00:02:33.066 --> 00:02:35.373
We have?

23
00:02:35.416 --> 00:02:36.872
Great, Linus.
Good luck, Charlie Brown.


24
00:02:36.896 --> 00:02:38.158
Have a good trip.

25
00:02:38.202 --> 00:02:39.943
Have a good trip.
Have fun!


26
00:02:39.986 --> 00:02:41.422
Good for you, Charles!

27
00:02:41.466 --> 00:02:42.380
You deserve it, Linus.

28
00:02:42.423 --> 00:02:43.685
Boy, what luck!

29
00:02:50.954 --> 00:02:52.694
Guess what?

30
00:02:52.738 --> 00:02:55.175
I've been selected to leave town.

31
00:02:55.219 --> 00:02:57.090
I guess I'm going to Europe.

32
00:02:57.134 --> 00:02:59.310
If you want to come along,

33
00:02:59.353 --> 00:03:01.873
maybe you'd better start thinking
about what you'd like to take.


34
00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:13.498
Hey! There's a letter in the mailbox.

35
00:03:15.587 --> 00:03:17.023
Wow! I've got a letter!

36
00:03:21.767 --> 00:03:23.508
It's written in...

37
00:03:23.551 --> 00:03:24.683
Some strange language.

38
00:03:29.601 --> 00:03:31.820
I see you got a letter, big brother.

39
00:03:31.864 --> 00:03:34.823
Uh-huh. This is the first
letter I've ever received,


40
00:03:34.867 --> 00:03:36.303
but I can't read it.

41
00:03:36.347 --> 00:03:37.739
Here, let me see it.

42
00:03:37.783 --> 00:03:39.785
No! You might lose it!

43
00:03:39.828 --> 00:03:42.092
I don't want anything to
happen to my first letter


44
00:03:42.135 --> 00:03:43.535
before I get the chance to read it.

45
00:03:49.447 --> 00:03:50.709
Hello?

46
00:03:50.752 --> 00:03:51.752
Hi, Chuck.

47
00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:53.886
This is Peppermint Patty.

48
00:03:53.929 --> 00:03:55.931
I have great news.

49
00:03:55.975 --> 00:03:59.587
A beautiful honor has been
bestowed on my friend Marcie


50
00:03:59.631 --> 00:04:02.068
and upon yours truly.

51
00:04:02.112 --> 00:04:05.202
Have you ever heard of a student
exchange program, Chuck?


52
00:04:05.245 --> 00:04:07.769
It's for outstanding students.

53
00:04:07.813 --> 00:04:09.747
But you wouldn't know about that,
would you, Chuck?


54
00:04:09.771 --> 00:04:11.556
I wouldn't?

55
00:04:11.599 --> 00:04:13.036
Of course you wouldn't, Chuck!

56
00:04:13.079 --> 00:04:14.994
Anyway, as I was saying,

57
00:04:15.038 --> 00:04:16.822
Marcie and I have been honored

58
00:04:16.865 --> 00:04:19.825
by being selected to go to
Europe, representing our school.


59
00:04:19.868 --> 00:04:22.001
What do you think of that, Chuck?

60
00:04:22.045 --> 00:04:24.134
Well, as a matter of fact,

61
00:04:24.177 --> 00:04:25.961
Linus and I also have been selected

62
00:04:26.005 --> 00:04:27.005
to represent our school.

63
00:04:27.354 --> 00:04:28.660
What?

64
00:04:28.703 --> 00:04:30.488
Linus and I have been chosen

65
00:04:30.531 --> 00:04:32.651
to go to Europe as part of a
student exchange program.


66
00:04:32.968 --> 00:04:34.579
Huh.

67
00:04:34.622 --> 00:04:36.929
I guess it's not such a
great honor after all.


68
00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:26.718
Always travel light, Marcie.

69
00:05:26.761 --> 00:05:28.372
That's my motto.

70
00:05:28.415 --> 00:05:30.809
That sounds like a good motto, sir.

71
00:05:30.852 --> 00:05:33.420
My only problem is

72
00:05:33.464 --> 00:05:37.250
trying to decide how many
pairs of sandals to take.


73
00:05:37.294 --> 00:05:41.080
My French guidebook doesn't say
anything about sandals, sir.


74
00:05:41.124 --> 00:05:43.691
I think I should
take along a black pair

75
00:05:43.735 --> 00:05:45.175
in case we have to dress for dinner.

76
00:05:59.794 --> 00:06:01.796
Ahh!

77
00:06:03.450 --> 00:06:06.540
Now I know why you travel light, sir...

78
00:06:06.584 --> 00:06:08.673
In case your luggage
falls on top of you.

79
00:06:19.074 --> 00:06:21.338
Good morning, fellow exchange student.

80
00:06:21.381 --> 00:06:23.296
I see you're all packed.

81
00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:25.385
Good morning, fellow exchange student.

82
00:06:25.429 --> 00:06:27.344
I, too, am all set to go.

83
00:06:27.387 --> 00:06:29.737
If I had my way,
I'd exchange both of you.


84
00:06:38.703 --> 00:06:40.792
You can't take all this stuff with you.

85
00:06:40.835 --> 00:06:42.715
You're going to have to
leave some of it behind.


86
00:06:51.368 --> 00:06:53.805
Why can't I have a normal
dog like everyone else?


87
00:07:17.871 --> 00:07:20.178
Now don't go over to Europe

88
00:07:20.222 --> 00:07:22.267
and embarrass us, big brother.

89
00:07:22.311 --> 00:07:24.748
If you're going to represent our school,

90
00:07:24.791 --> 00:07:26.967
try to do things right for a change.

91
00:07:27.011 --> 00:07:28.795
Goodbye, everybody.

92
00:07:28.839 --> 00:07:30.710
Take care of the old ball field, Schroeder.

93
00:07:30.754 --> 00:07:32.190
I'm going to miss it.

94
00:07:32.234 --> 00:07:34.497
The last time you went away, big brother,

95
00:07:34.540 --> 00:07:36.194
your team won three games in a row.

96
00:07:56.997 --> 00:07:59.870
Bon voyage, Charlie Brown!

97
00:07:59.913 --> 00:08:01.132
And don't come back!

98
00:08:27.419 --> 00:08:28.594
Oh, no!

99
00:08:28.638 --> 00:08:30.117
Ahh!
Ahh!


100
00:08:30.944 --> 00:08:31.944
Ahh!

101
00:08:35.166 --> 00:08:36.950
What a trip.

102
00:08:36.994 --> 00:08:38.517
We haven't even left the airport,

103
00:08:38.561 --> 00:08:40.127
and I'm already sick.

104
00:08:40.171 --> 00:08:41.477
Tickets, please.

105
00:08:43.653 --> 00:08:46.133
Ah, yes.
First class.


106
00:08:46.177 --> 00:08:48.310
Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.
Have a nice trip.


107
00:08:48.353 --> 00:08:49.963
First class?

108
00:08:50.007 --> 00:08:51.878
Proceed to the VIP lounge, sir.

109
00:08:52.401 --> 00:08:54.316
VIP lounge?

110
00:08:54.359 --> 00:08:56.230
How come he goes first class,

111
00:08:56.274 --> 00:08:57.667
and we go tourist?

112
00:08:58.885 --> 00:09:00.365
He's your dog, 
Charlie Brown.

113
00:09:53.766 --> 00:09:55.265
Have you made
your selection, sir?


114
00:10:02.819 --> 00:10:05.430
Hey, Marcie.
This is real nice.


115
00:10:05.474 --> 00:10:06.866
It's a whole lot better

116
00:10:06.910 --> 00:10:08.651
than peanut butter sandwiches, sir.

117
00:10:08.694 --> 00:10:11.218
What do you think
they'll feed us in France?

118
00:10:11.262 --> 00:10:13.395
Probably peanut butter on French bread, sir.

119
00:10:22.360 --> 00:10:23.381
Coffee, tea, or milk?

120
00:10:23.405 --> 00:10:24.710
Coffee, tea, or milk?

121
00:10:27.670 --> 00:10:29.454
Coffee, tea, or milk, sir?

122
00:10:47.951 --> 00:10:49.231
Finished, sir?

123
00:11:15.979 --> 00:11:17.676
Hi, Chuck.

124
00:11:17.720 --> 00:11:19.809
We just came down the
aisle to check you out.

125
00:11:19.852 --> 00:11:21.375
What are you guys reading?

126
00:11:21.419 --> 00:11:23.813
Well, before we left home,

127
00:11:23.856 --> 00:11:25.056
I got this letter from France,

128
00:11:26.119 --> 00:11:27.251
but I can't read it.

129
00:11:27.294 --> 00:11:28.731
You're in luck, Chuck.

130
00:11:28.774 --> 00:11:30.646
Marcie here can help you.

131
00:11:30.689 --> 00:11:32.430
Marcie has been studying French.

132
00:11:35.172 --> 00:11:36.695
Here, Marcie.

133
00:11:36.739 --> 00:11:38.299
Look this over and
tell us what it says.


134
00:11:41.570 --> 00:11:43.876
"C'est adresse a monsieur Brown."

135
00:11:43.920 --> 00:11:46.096
"It's addressed to Mr. Brown."

136
00:11:46.139 --> 00:11:47.139
Is that you, Chuck?

137
00:11:48.011 --> 00:11:49.621
Yes, I guess it is.

138
00:11:49.665 --> 00:11:52.015
Mr. Charles Brown.
That's me.


139
00:11:52.058 --> 00:11:53.146
"MonsieurBrown..."

140
00:12:00.284 --> 00:12:02.242
"Mr. Charles Brown,

141
00:12:02.286 --> 00:12:04.767
"I am writing to greet you

142
00:12:04.810 --> 00:12:06.610
"and wish you a
happy journey to my country."

143
00:12:17.083 --> 00:12:18.523
"I have known about you all my life,

144
00:12:19.738 --> 00:12:21.378
"and I'm looking forward to meeting you."

145
00:12:28.007 --> 00:12:30.227
"You'll be welcome to stay at my home

146
00:12:30.270 --> 00:12:32.490
"at the Chateau Mal Voisin."

147
00:12:33.578 --> 00:12:36.015
Mal Voisin?
What does it mean?


148
00:12:36.059 --> 00:12:38.540
I think it means bad neighbor.

149
00:12:38.583 --> 00:12:40.890
The Chateau of the Bad Neighbor, Chuck.

150
00:12:51.814 --> 00:12:53.642
"I hope you enjoy your stay

151
00:12:53.685 --> 00:12:56.340
"and benefit from the experience.

152
00:12:56.383 --> 00:12:59.169
"Yours in expectation, 
Violette Honfleur."

153
00:12:59.778 --> 00:13:01.606
Violette Honfleur?

154
00:13:01.650 --> 00:13:03.695
Have you been holding out on us, Chuck?

155
00:13:03.739 --> 00:13:06.132
Who's this Honfleur girl?

156
00:13:06.176 --> 00:13:08.134
I don't have the slightest idea.

157
00:13:08.178 --> 00:13:10.136
I don't even know where we're going.

158
00:13:10.180 --> 00:13:14.532
This letter is written from l'Heron, Chuck.

159
00:13:14.576 --> 00:13:17.883
That's a bird, a big bird.

160
00:13:17.927 --> 00:13:21.147
You're going to be staying at
the Chateau of the Bad Neighbor


161
00:13:21.191 --> 00:13:22.540
in l'Heron.

162
00:13:22.584 --> 00:13:24.411
I think I should've stayed home.

163
00:13:24.455 --> 00:13:25.606
Ladies and gentlemen,

164
00:13:25.630 --> 00:13:27.676
we're about to start our in-flight films.

165
00:13:27.719 --> 00:13:29.286
In the front and rear section,

166
00:13:29.329 --> 00:13:31.593
the filmLaughing Bunnies will be shown

167
00:13:31.636 --> 00:13:33.856
plusNaughty Marietta in the center section.

168
00:13:33.899 --> 00:13:36.946
So long, Chuck.
I'm going to the center section.


169
00:13:36.989 --> 00:13:38.861
I'll leave the kid stuff
for the likes of you.


170
00:14:20.554 --> 00:14:22.252
Hey, Linus!
I see land.


171
00:14:31.826 --> 00:14:34.393
Wow! Look at that, Linus.

172
00:14:34.437 --> 00:14:37.222
That should be either
Dornoch Firth or Moray Firth.


173
00:14:37.266 --> 00:14:39.660
It's probably Moray Firth.

174
00:14:39.703 --> 00:14:41.139
I think that's Inverness Bridge!

175
00:14:43.664 --> 00:14:46.797
See? We are just approaching
the Firth of Forth,


176
00:14:46.841 --> 00:14:48.886
and there in the distance,
you can see Glasgow.


177
00:14:54.457 --> 00:14:57.678
That's Scotland we're flying over,
the way I figure it.


178
00:14:57.721 --> 00:15:00.071
We should be landing
in London within the hour.


179
00:15:00.115 --> 00:15:01.203
Hey, Chuck!

180
00:15:02.639 --> 00:15:05.120
Hey, Chuck, we'll be landing pretty soon!

181
00:15:05.860 --> 00:15:07.557
You okay, kid?

182
00:15:07.600 --> 00:15:09.864
I'll take care of you, kid!

183
00:15:09.907 --> 00:15:11.909
If you have any problems,
I'll be here!


184
00:15:13.781 --> 00:15:15.236
Ladies and gentlemen,

185
00:15:15.260 --> 00:15:18.568
we'll be landing soon
in London's Heathrow Airport.


186
00:15:18.611 --> 00:15:21.223
Will you please bring all seats
to their upright positions,


187
00:15:21.266 --> 00:15:23.138
return folding trays
to their locked position,


188
00:15:23.181 --> 00:15:24.705
and fasten seat belts?

189
00:16:01.959 --> 00:16:03.613
Hey, Chuck, how about this?

190
00:16:03.656 --> 00:16:05.354
We're in England!

191
00:16:05.397 --> 00:16:07.197
Did you ever think you'd
be in England, Chuck?


192
00:16:09.010 --> 00:16:10.011
Who does he think he is,

193
00:16:10.620 --> 00:16:11.752
the prime minister?

194
00:16:14.624 --> 00:16:15.864
Passport, please.

195
00:16:18.149 --> 00:16:19.542
Mmm.
Staying on holiday?


196
00:16:22.153 --> 00:16:23.153
Hmm.

197
00:16:26.114 --> 00:16:27.724
Passport, please.

198
00:16:27.768 --> 00:16:29.247
Yes, sir.

199
00:16:29.291 --> 00:16:31.162
We're just passing through.

200
00:16:31.206 --> 00:16:32.729
We're on our way to France, sir.

201
00:16:33.686 --> 00:16:36.124
I have nothing to declare, sir.

202
00:16:36.167 --> 00:16:38.779
I throw myself on
the mercy of the court!

203
00:16:38.822 --> 00:16:40.693
We've only been here two minutes,

204
00:16:40.737 --> 00:16:42.434
and already he's embarrassing us.

205
00:16:48.876 --> 00:16:50.312
Whoa! No!

206
00:16:50.355 --> 00:16:51.400
Ooh! Ow!

207
00:16:51.443 --> 00:16:52.836
Ooh! Ahh!

208
00:16:53.489 --> 00:16:55.056
Oh, good grief!

209
00:16:55.099 --> 00:16:56.187
Oh, no!

210
00:16:56.492 --> 00:16:57.492
Ahh!

211
00:18:26.234 --> 00:18:28.714
Now where does he think he's going?

212
00:18:28.758 --> 00:18:30.629
Where are you going?
We can't leave you here.


213
00:18:33.632 --> 00:18:34.677
Wimbledon?

214
00:18:35.286 --> 00:18:37.071
Good grief!

215
00:18:37.114 --> 00:18:38.637
Okay, but don't forget.

216
00:18:38.681 --> 00:18:40.726
The train leaves at 5:30.

217
00:18:40.770 --> 00:18:42.337
We'll meet you at Victoria Station.

218
00:19:45.835 --> 00:19:46.967
Play, please.

219
00:19:53.147 --> 00:19:54.365
Love-15.

220
00:19:55.976 --> 00:19:56.976
Play, please.

221
00:20:10.642 --> 00:20:12.514
Love-30.
Play, please.


222
00:20:24.613 --> 00:20:25.701
Love-40!

223
00:20:27.398 --> 00:20:28.398
Play, please.

224
00:20:34.797 --> 00:20:36.668
The ball was in!

225
00:20:36.712 --> 00:20:38.235
Love-40!

226
00:20:38.279 --> 00:20:39.367
Play, please!

227
00:20:54.121 --> 00:20:55.731
Mr. Snoopy!

228
00:21:32.115 --> 00:21:33.464
All right, governor.

229
00:21:33.508 --> 00:21:34.683
You ready to order?

230
00:21:34.726 --> 00:21:36.901
Can you help us with the menu?

231
00:21:36.945 --> 00:21:39.861
For the gentlemen,
I recommend the beef and kidney pie.


232
00:21:39.904 --> 00:21:42.342
Shepherd's pie is rather
nice for the ladies.


233
00:21:42.385 --> 00:21:44.265
The cheddar and pickle
sandwich is rather top-o.


234
00:21:44.300 --> 00:21:45.321
What be your pleasure, mate?

235
00:21:45.345 --> 00:21:47.782
What is...
What did he say?


236
00:21:47.825 --> 00:21:50.001
Perhaps I should have studied English,
not French.


237
00:22:04.799 --> 00:22:05.863
Where to, Governor?

238
00:22:08.890 --> 00:22:11.980
Blimey, it's a bit dicey
understanding these yanks.


239
00:22:12.023 --> 00:22:15.026
Bit odd, mate.
I feel proper Charlie not understanding,


240
00:22:15.070 --> 00:22:17.246
but can you say it slow once more?

241
00:22:24.819 --> 00:22:25.819
Great lunch, Chuck.

242
00:22:26.342 --> 00:22:27.604
I like your style.

243
00:22:28.605 --> 00:22:29.911
I wish I knew what we ate.

244
00:22:31.347 --> 00:22:33.828
Well, let's get on a bus and
get to Victoria Station.


245
00:23:46.901 --> 00:23:48.685
We go to Dover.

246
00:23:48.729 --> 00:23:50.557
It'll take a couple hours, Chuck.

247
00:25:03.847 --> 00:25:05.414
We're approaching Dover.

248
00:25:05.458 --> 00:25:08.287
Here we get into a hovercraft.

249
00:25:08.330 --> 00:25:10.289
It's a big boat
that takes us to France

250
00:25:11.072 --> 00:25:12.726
in just 45 minutes, Chuck.

251
00:26:37.854 --> 00:26:40.117
We'd like to rent a car, sir.

252
00:26:40.161 --> 00:26:42.990
Location de voiture, monsieur.

253
00:26:45.209 --> 00:26:47.009
He wants to know who's going
to drive the car.


254
00:26:50.258 --> 00:26:51.912
S'il vous plait.

255
00:27:01.704 --> 00:27:04.359
He says it's the blue car
in the parking lot.


256
00:27:04.403 --> 00:27:07.014
That was good translating, Marcie.

257
00:27:07.057 --> 00:27:08.755
You would have been a great GI.

258
00:27:44.704 --> 00:27:46.053
Hang a right to Rouen, Snoopy.

259
00:27:49.796 --> 00:27:51.188
Qu'est-ce que tu as dans le crane?

260
00:27:52.842 --> 00:27:54.148
Ouh! Les cornes!

261
00:27:56.150 --> 00:27:58.065
Qu'est-ce que tu veux que je fasse?

262
00:27:58.805 --> 00:27:59.893
Que dalle!

263
00:28:02.504 --> 00:28:04.288
Le pied de nez...

264
00:28:04.332 --> 00:28:05.899
Du menu fretin!

265
00:28:23.699 --> 00:28:26.354
Where do we turn next?

266
00:28:26.397 --> 00:28:28.965
Do we follow the red lines
or the black lines?


267
00:28:29.009 --> 00:28:30.924
I think we're following the dotted lines.

268
00:28:42.762 --> 00:28:45.286
Here's Morville.
You girls get off.


269
00:28:45.329 --> 00:28:48.201
Linus and I go on to l'Heron,

270
00:28:48.244 --> 00:28:50.725
and the Chateau de la Mal Voisin.

271
00:28:50.769 --> 00:28:52.727
Le Heron, Chuck.

272
00:28:52.771 --> 00:28:54.990
The Chateau.
The Chateau of the bad neighbor.


273
00:28:57.036 --> 00:28:59.560
We drive to "Abbyville, Blangy,

274
00:28:59.604 --> 00:29:02.389
"Neuf Chatel en
-Bray."

275
00:29:02.432 --> 00:29:04.434
Abbeville, Blanzy

276
00:29:04.478 --> 00:29:05.827
Neufchatel-en
-Bray.

277
00:29:06.698 --> 00:29:08.526
Well, whatever.

278
00:29:08.569 --> 00:29:11.180
When we reach a river called Andelle,

279
00:29:11.224 --> 00:29:12.864
we'll be very close to where we're going.

280
00:29:25.760 --> 00:29:28.807
Hey, this is it.
That's the river,


281
00:29:28.850 --> 00:29:31.505
and our first stop is Morville sur Andelle.

282
00:29:47.565 --> 00:29:49.915
That's it!
That's it!


283
00:29:49.958 --> 00:29:52.961
"Turn right from highway
to the central de ville.


284
00:29:53.005 --> 00:29:54.789
"Turn right at the first intersection.

285
00:29:57.575 --> 00:30:00.142
"Drive through town to
the first farm on the right."


286
00:30:01.666 --> 00:30:04.538
Wow! Look at those old buildings.

287
00:30:20.685 --> 00:30:22.817
Hey, Chuck, the old car's collapsed on us.

288
00:30:24.471 --> 00:30:26.560
A fine mess you've gotten us in, Chuck.

289
00:30:28.214 --> 00:30:30.477
And just when I
was beginning to get hungry.

290
00:30:33.567 --> 00:30:36.352
Hey, Chuck, look at that.
A bakery.


291
00:30:36.396 --> 00:30:38.116
We could get some bread
and make sandwiches.


292
00:30:39.051 --> 00:30:42.402
Great idea.
Run over and get us some bread.


293
00:30:42.445 --> 00:30:45.535
Come on, Chuck, hop to it.
We're hungry.


294
00:30:45.579 --> 00:30:47.886
Get some hot dogs, mustard,
and ketchup, Chuck.


295
00:30:50.018 --> 00:30:52.542
Oon loaf de bread, sil-voo play.

296
00:30:54.544 --> 00:30:55.545
Merci.

297
00:31:08.907 --> 00:31:09.907
Argh!

298
00:31:15.435 --> 00:31:16.479
Ah-choo!

299
00:31:19.918 --> 00:31:21.746
Oon loaf de bread, sil-voo play.

300
00:31:24.009 --> 00:31:25.010
Merci!

301
00:31:40.199 --> 00:31:41.199
Argh!

302
00:31:45.726 --> 00:31:47.685
This is great, Chuck.

303
00:31:47.728 --> 00:31:49.774
Very generous of you to
give your share to the car.


304
00:31:51.776 --> 00:31:53.865
Notice how well the car is running

305
00:31:53.908 --> 00:31:55.214
since you gave it some bread.

306
00:32:18.585 --> 00:32:22.458
Bonjour.
C'est ca la ferme de San Simeon?


307
00:32:23.590 --> 00:32:25.026
Good afternoon.

308
00:32:25.070 --> 00:32:26.510
Are you Peppermint Patty and Marcie?

309
00:32:29.552 --> 00:32:31.467
The way he drives,

310
00:32:31.511 --> 00:32:34.035
Marcie and I are glad to be here.

311
00:32:34.079 --> 00:32:37.386
I am Pierre.
I'm very pleased to meet you.


312
00:32:37.430 --> 00:32:40.172
I wish to welcome you to my country.

313
00:32:40.215 --> 00:32:41.956
This is my friend Marcie.

314
00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:44.219
She can speak French pretty good.

315
00:32:44.263 --> 00:32:45.873
Enchantee, Pierre.

316
00:32:45.917 --> 00:32:47.832
How nice to know you.

317
00:32:47.875 --> 00:32:50.051
We're pleased to welcome someone

318
00:32:50.095 --> 00:32:53.011
who has made an effort to
learn our beautiful language.


319
00:32:53.054 --> 00:32:54.839
Thank you.

320
00:32:54.882 --> 00:32:57.406
We look forward to
a nice visit in France.

321
00:32:57.450 --> 00:32:59.495
These are our friends.

322
00:32:59.539 --> 00:33:01.323
You'll meet them later.

323
00:33:01.367 --> 00:33:03.195
They must be going.

324
00:33:03.238 --> 00:33:05.501
So long.
We're on our way to the chateau.


325
00:33:05.545 --> 00:33:06.720
See you tomorrow at school.

326
00:33:06.764 --> 00:33:07.765
See ya.

327
00:33:12.900 --> 00:33:14.467
Did he say chateau?

328
00:33:14.510 --> 00:33:16.251
Surely they're not staying

329
00:33:16.295 --> 00:33:17.775
at the chateau of the bad neighbor?

330
00:33:17.818 --> 00:33:20.734
Yes, they are.
Mal voisin.


331
00:33:20.778 --> 00:33:22.388
But that is terrible.

332
00:33:22.431 --> 00:33:23.868
They cannot stay there.

333
00:33:23.911 --> 00:33:25.826
Why not, Pierre?

334
00:33:25.870 --> 00:33:27.175
They could be in great danger.

335
00:33:27.219 --> 00:33:28.568
Danger?

336
00:33:28.611 --> 00:33:30.526
No one, absolutely no one,

337
00:33:30.570 --> 00:33:32.746
goes to that chateau.

338
00:33:32.790 --> 00:33:35.880
If you're from another country,
that's even worse.


339
00:33:35.923 --> 00:33:38.447
But Chuck received
a letter from the chateau.


340
00:33:38.491 --> 00:33:41.276
But that, too, is impossible.

341
00:33:41.320 --> 00:33:44.192
The baron would never allow such a thing.

342
00:33:44.236 --> 00:33:46.238
The baron?
What baron?


343
00:33:46.281 --> 00:33:48.370
We must see if we can do something.

344
00:33:50.459 --> 00:33:52.244
Stay on this road, Snoopy.

345
00:33:52.287 --> 00:33:53.607
We should run into the town soon.

346
00:33:54.986 --> 00:33:57.118
I sure hope we find the
chateau before dark.


347
00:34:09.478 --> 00:34:11.829
Look for a sign that says Le Heron.

348
00:34:11.872 --> 00:34:13.918
It's only four or five kilometers.

349
00:34:32.675 --> 00:34:34.852
Look at that.
The wipers are stuck.


350
00:35:00.051 --> 00:35:02.009
Hey, here we come to a village.

351
00:35:02.053 --> 00:35:03.445
Slow down, Snoopy.

352
00:35:04.969 --> 00:35:07.667
This is the town.
This is le Heron.


353
00:35:07.710 --> 00:35:10.017
I saw the sign.
And look,


354
00:35:10.061 --> 00:35:11.584
that must be our school.

355
00:35:27.121 --> 00:35:30.690
A kilometer or so past the
town, there's the nursery.


356
00:35:30.733 --> 00:35:33.432
After the nursery,
the next road is it.


357
00:35:34.389 --> 00:35:35.869
There it is.

358
00:35:35.913 --> 00:35:37.653
There it is!

359
00:35:37.697 --> 00:35:39.394
See the greenhouses past the nursery?

360
00:35:39.438 --> 00:35:40.438
Slow up, Snoopy.

361
00:35:42.658 --> 00:35:44.225
Now look for the road to the left.

362
00:35:55.497 --> 00:35:57.499
This must be it, 
Charlie Brown.

363
00:35:57.543 --> 00:35:59.805
Although I can't see any chateau.

364
00:35:59.848 --> 00:36:01.502
Boy, it's getting darker.

365
00:36:01.546 --> 00:36:02.677
It's getting spooky.

366
00:36:04.592 --> 00:36:07.073
Well, let's go on.
We have no choice.


367
00:36:22.349 --> 00:36:23.698
Ha!

368
00:36:32.925 --> 00:36:34.971
This is it, Linus.

369
00:36:35.014 --> 00:36:36.334
This is where
we're going to stay.


370
00:36:45.285 --> 00:36:47.505
Are you sure, madam?

371
00:36:47.548 --> 00:36:49.507
You're sure there is no answer?

372
00:36:49.550 --> 00:36:51.552
All right, thank you. Merci.

373
00:36:51.596 --> 00:36:52.989
No answer?

374
00:36:53.032 --> 00:36:54.816
Shouldn't they have been there by now?

375
00:36:54.860 --> 00:36:56.775
Now what do we do?

376
00:36:56.818 --> 00:36:58.820
There's nothing we can do.

377
00:36:58.864 --> 00:37:01.693
We must wait until morning
and hope they're okay.


378
00:37:01.736 --> 00:37:04.087
I don't like this, sir.

379
00:37:04.130 --> 00:37:06.210
Chuck didn't fly all the way
over here to get mugged.


380
00:37:17.622 --> 00:37:19.493
Boy, this place sure looks gloomy.

381
00:37:20.755 --> 00:37:22.192
Nobody seems to be home.

382
00:37:22.235 --> 00:37:23.628
Knock on the door,
Charlie Brown.


383
00:37:58.706 --> 00:38:00.317
That's Snoopy's yipe.

384
00:38:00.360 --> 00:38:02.014
Maybe he needs help.
Let's go.


385
00:38:08.499 --> 00:38:09.630
Aah!
Aah!


386
00:38:13.982 --> 00:38:15.549
He's inside.
I heard him.


387
00:38:22.513 --> 00:38:23.514
Aah!
Aah!


388
00:38:29.302 --> 00:38:30.347
Yipe!
Yipe!


389
00:38:39.486 --> 00:38:40.574
I can't believe it.

390
00:38:41.314 --> 00:38:43.360
There's no one home.

391
00:38:43.403 --> 00:38:45.797
Why would they invite us clear over here

392
00:38:45.840 --> 00:38:46.972
and then not be home?

393
00:38:50.976 --> 00:38:52.760
We can't stay out here all night.

394
00:38:52.804 --> 00:38:54.893
We'll have to find a place that's dry.

395
00:39:02.988 --> 00:39:04.990
There's a dry-looking spot.

396
00:39:05.773 --> 00:39:07.210
Let's get out of this rain.

397
00:39:16.088 --> 00:39:18.438
This looks like a stable or something.

398
00:39:18.482 --> 00:39:19.787
Let's camp here.

399
00:39:22.007 --> 00:39:23.748
This is terrible.

400
00:39:23.791 --> 00:39:26.316
Here we are, strangers
in a strange place,


401
00:39:26.359 --> 00:39:28.448
nobody knows we're here,

402
00:39:28.492 --> 00:39:30.842
and it looks like nobody cares.

403
00:39:30.885 --> 00:39:34.106
Snoopy, you'll have to be our watchdog.

404
00:39:34.150 --> 00:39:36.848
You stand out here and guard everything.

405
00:39:36.891 --> 00:39:39.024
If anybody comes around,
you let us know.


406
00:43:54.539 --> 00:43:57.063
Hey, where did these blankets come from?

407
00:43:57.107 --> 00:43:58.978
Linus, wake up.

408
00:43:59.022 --> 00:44:01.024
Huh? Huh?
What? What?


409
00:44:01.372 --> 00:44:02.373
Look!

410
00:44:05.637 --> 00:44:07.030
Linus, look there.

411
00:44:09.859 --> 00:44:11.469
Where did all that food come from?

412
00:44:18.607 --> 00:44:20.652
And where's Snoopy?
Where's our guard dog?


413
00:44:22.437 --> 00:44:24.308
Do you think he's been dognapped?

414
00:44:27.180 --> 00:44:28.220
Good grief!

415
00:44:31.141 --> 00:44:33.273
Where have you been?

416
00:44:33.317 --> 00:44:35.188
We could have been mugged,
for all you care.


417
00:44:52.945 --> 00:44:55.078
Look at the time.

418
00:44:55.121 --> 00:44:57.123
We're going to be late
for our first day of school.


419
00:44:57.167 --> 00:44:58.821
Come on, Charlie Brown.

420
00:44:58.864 --> 00:45:01.737
What are we going
to do about the chateau?

421
00:45:01.780 --> 00:45:04.043
None of this makes sense.

422
00:45:04.087 --> 00:45:06.742
This place is giving me the creeps.

423
00:45:06.785 --> 00:45:09.440
We'll deal with the chateau later.
Come on.


424
00:45:11.181 --> 00:45:13.444
It's sure spooky, Linus.

425
00:45:13.488 --> 00:45:15.185
I hope it all works out soon.

426
00:45:26.326 --> 00:45:29.112
Gee, I sure hope
Chuck and Linus are okay.

427
00:45:29.155 --> 00:45:31.114
I think everything must be all right,

428
00:45:32.289 --> 00:45:33.569
or we will have heard from them.

429
00:45:34.291 --> 00:45:36.554
If they do not show up at school,

430
00:45:36.598 --> 00:45:38.600
then we'll go to the chateau

431
00:45:38.643 --> 00:45:40.558
to be sure they're okay.

432
00:45:40.602 --> 00:45:42.821
Hey, Marcie, this is hard work.

433
00:45:42.865 --> 00:45:45.041
Where do we go for chow?

434
00:45:45.084 --> 00:45:47.391
Ask Pierre when we eat
and what we're having.


435
00:45:48.697 --> 00:45:51.177
Now that we're in France,

436
00:45:51.221 --> 00:45:53.484
maybe we can have some good French toast

437
00:45:53.528 --> 00:45:56.313
or French fries for breakfast.

438
00:45:56.356 --> 00:46:00.665
Pierre, a quelle heure on
prend le petit dejeuner?


439
00:46:00.709 --> 00:46:03.712
I think it's time now.
Let's go and find out.


440
00:46:03.755 --> 00:46:06.149
I could sure use some cakes and syrup.

441
00:46:06.192 --> 00:46:08.455
Maybe some bacon and eggs on the side.

442
00:46:08.499 --> 00:46:10.545
Come on.
Pierre says we can go eat now.


443
00:46:12.503 --> 00:46:13.548
Great!
Let's go get it.


444
00:46:17.073 --> 00:46:19.292
I hope he said we get
French pancakes. Wow!


445
00:46:20.511 --> 00:46:22.818
Marcie, I'm worried about Pete.

446
00:46:22.861 --> 00:46:24.646
I think he's fallen for me.

447
00:46:24.689 --> 00:46:27.344
Are you certain, sir?
Are you sure?


448
00:46:27.387 --> 00:46:30.565
What can I do?
I hate to let him down.


449
00:46:30.608 --> 00:46:32.697
I guess I have to be polite.

450
00:46:32.741 --> 00:46:34.351
Don't worry about it, sir.

451
00:46:39.791 --> 00:46:43.490
Cheese, sausages, soup...
For breakfast?


452
00:46:43.534 --> 00:46:46.102
We're in France, sir.
We have to adjust.


453
00:46:46.145 --> 00:46:47.538
Pass the sausages.

454
00:46:50.672 --> 00:46:52.848
What's that you're putting on?

455
00:46:52.891 --> 00:46:57.069
Pierre says we got to wear
tabliers over our clothes,


456
00:46:57.113 --> 00:47:00.812
and this backpack is for our
books and school papers.


457
00:47:00.856 --> 00:47:02.727
We're going to look weird, Marcie.

458
00:47:02.771 --> 00:47:04.903
But if we all look weird,

459
00:47:04.947 --> 00:47:06.383
maybe none of us will look weird.

460
00:47:07.993 --> 00:47:11.431
I've never carried
books to school in my life.


461
00:47:11.475 --> 00:47:13.390
That's why you get all
those Cs and Ds, sir.


462
00:47:21.224 --> 00:47:23.443
Hi, Chuck.
Hi, Linus.


463
00:47:23.487 --> 00:47:26.011
Hey, Chuck, where's your
tablier and backpack?


464
00:47:26.055 --> 00:47:27.970
My what?

465
00:47:28.013 --> 00:47:31.016
Are you going to embarrass
us on our first day?


466
00:47:31.060 --> 00:47:32.757
I don't know what you're talking about.

467
00:47:32.801 --> 00:47:34.977
Nobody's told us anything.

468
00:47:35.020 --> 00:47:37.762
All I know is,
we had a terrible time.


469
00:47:37.806 --> 00:47:40.460
Nobody met us,
we got caught in the rain,


470
00:47:40.504 --> 00:47:42.680
the lightning scared us,

471
00:47:42.724 --> 00:47:45.683
and we slept in
the stable at the chateau.

472
00:47:45.727 --> 00:47:47.903
Le chateaux de le Mal Voisin?

473
00:47:47.946 --> 00:47:49.731
C'est impossible!

474
00:47:49.774 --> 00:47:52.734
Nobody go to the chateau
of the bad neighbor.


475
00:47:52.777 --> 00:47:55.562
The baron is a recluse
and hates everybody.


476
00:47:55.606 --> 00:47:57.826
He do not allow visitors.

477
00:47:57.869 --> 00:48:00.089
Then why did they invite us?

478
00:48:00.132 --> 00:48:03.092
See? I got a letter from V. Honfleur.

479
00:48:03.135 --> 00:48:05.094
She invited us.

480
00:48:05.137 --> 00:48:08.967
Violette?
She's a ward of the baron's.


481
00:48:09.011 --> 00:48:12.144
If she invited you, the baron
did not know about it.


482
00:48:12.188 --> 00:48:14.407
The baron do not invite anyone.

483
00:48:15.626 --> 00:48:18.324
The baron is a very violent person.

484
00:48:18.368 --> 00:48:20.413
He hates everybody.

485
00:48:20.457 --> 00:48:22.720
That doesn't make sense.

486
00:48:22.764 --> 00:48:24.330
Why did she invite you, 
Charlie Brown?

487
00:48:30.685 --> 00:48:32.948
C'est avec grand plaisir

488
00:48:32.991 --> 00:48:35.080
que j'introduis nos amis d'Amerique

489
00:48:35.124 --> 00:48:36.865
Charlie Brown,

490
00:48:36.908 --> 00:48:39.215
Marcie, Peppermint Patty,

491
00:48:39.258 --> 00:48:40.738
and Linus van Pelt.

492
00:48:44.133 --> 00:48:47.440
Mess amiss, we're glad to be here.

493
00:48:47.484 --> 00:48:51.444
We bring you greetings from
across the sea or the ocean.


494
00:48:51.488 --> 00:48:53.446
As someone once said,

495
00:48:53.490 --> 00:48:54.491
"Lafayette, we are here!"

496
00:48:57.146 --> 00:48:58.408
Who is Lafayette?

497
00:48:59.888 --> 00:49:02.325
Did you notice the nice
way Pete talked about me?


498
00:49:02.368 --> 00:49:05.589
The poor kid's fallen for me.

499
00:49:05.632 --> 00:49:07.330
Don't worry about it, sir.

500
00:49:07.373 --> 00:49:08.373
I have to worry about it.

501
00:49:09.724 --> 00:49:12.291
I don't want to
let the poor kid down.

502
00:49:12.335 --> 00:49:14.685
In honor of our American guests,

503
00:49:14.729 --> 00:49:16.513
we'll conduct classes

504
00:49:16.556 --> 00:49:19.081
both in English and French.

505
00:49:19.124 --> 00:49:21.518
In the morning,
it'll be English,


506
00:49:21.561 --> 00:49:24.913
and the afternoon,
it'll be in French.


507
00:49:24.956 --> 00:49:27.611
Great. That way, nobody knows
what's going on.


508
00:49:27.654 --> 00:49:29.047
Peppermint Patty?

509
00:49:29.091 --> 00:49:30.614
Yes, ma'am?

510
00:49:30.657 --> 00:49:33.225
Please sit next to your friend Chuck.

511
00:49:33.269 --> 00:49:35.097
Marcie, will you sit with Pierre?

512
00:49:37.229 --> 00:49:39.318
I'd sort of hoped to sit
with my good friend Pierre,


513
00:49:39.362 --> 00:49:41.538
but that's okay.

514
00:49:41.581 --> 00:49:43.670
Pierre will be disappointed, Marcie.

515
00:49:43.714 --> 00:49:45.281
Be polite and nice to him.

516
00:49:45.324 --> 00:49:47.457
Don't worry, sir.

517
00:49:47.500 --> 00:49:49.380
I'll go sit with Chuck.
He needs help, you know.


518
00:49:51.591 --> 00:49:53.550
Hey, Chuck, we get to sit together.

519
00:49:59.251 --> 00:50:02.559
Be careful, Chuck. Pierre may get
jealous if you sit too close to me.


520
00:50:05.475 --> 00:50:08.913
Okay, Chuck, this is
the way we're going to work.


521
00:50:08.957 --> 00:50:11.133
As long as we're sitting
at the same desk,


522
00:50:11.176 --> 00:50:12.961
we might as well be a team.

523
00:50:14.963 --> 00:50:16.921
Your hip is touching my hip, Chuck.

524
00:50:18.793 --> 00:50:20.838
If you know an answer and I don't,

525
00:50:20.881 --> 00:50:22.708
you tell me what it is, Chuck.

526
00:50:23.840 --> 00:50:25.842
If I know an answer and you don't,

527
00:50:25.886 --> 00:50:28.802
I'll tell you what it is, okay?

528
00:50:28.845 --> 00:50:31.195
What happens if neither
of us knows the answer?


529
00:50:31.979 --> 00:50:33.937
We'll punt.

530
00:50:33.981 --> 00:50:37.811
Peppermint, what was
the significance of 1066?


531
00:50:39.073 --> 00:50:40.596
What happened in 1066?

532
00:50:45.253 --> 00:50:46.732
Well, it all depends.

533
00:50:48.082 --> 00:50:49.735
Is it a date or an address?

534
00:50:55.437 --> 00:50:57.613
False? Why did you put down false, Chuck?

535
00:50:59.397 --> 00:51:02.400
The answer is true.
Put down true, Chuck.


536
00:51:03.271 --> 00:51:05.490
What's true is true.

537
00:51:05.534 --> 00:51:08.276
Put down true, Chuck,
or I'll never speak to you again.


538
00:51:09.146 --> 00:51:10.844
Children! Charles!

539
00:51:11.714 --> 00:51:12.758
Ma'am?

540
00:51:14.325 --> 00:51:17.024
Is Peppermint giving you the answers?

541
00:51:17.067 --> 00:51:19.461
Oh, no, ma'am,
she's not giving me the answers.


542
00:51:20.549 --> 00:51:22.290
Forcing, maybe, but not giving.

543
00:51:40.134 --> 00:51:41.526
Children!

544
00:51:41.570 --> 00:51:44.094
Charles?
Patricia?


545
00:51:44.138 --> 00:51:49.143
How many times does 25 go into 75?

546
00:51:49.186 --> 00:51:51.754
Charles?
Charles, did you hear my question?


547
00:51:51.797 --> 00:51:54.583
Ma'am?
Oh, no, ma'am.


548
00:51:54.626 --> 00:51:57.847
I guess there was an airplane
flying over or something.


549
00:51:57.891 --> 00:51:59.936
Patricia?

550
00:51:59.980 --> 00:52:02.896
Patricia, are you asleep?

551
00:52:02.939 --> 00:52:07.901
How many times does 25 go into 75?

552
00:52:07.944 --> 00:52:10.338
I'm awake! I'm awake!
The answer is 12.


553
00:52:11.208 --> 00:52:13.558
No, that is not correct.

554
00:52:13.602 --> 00:52:16.170
The answer is six.
Three.


555
00:52:16.213 --> 00:52:17.519
Three is correct.

556
00:52:19.390 --> 00:52:21.697
You contradicted me, Chuck.

557
00:52:21.740 --> 00:52:24.482
You made a fool out of me
in front of the whole class.


558
00:52:26.136 --> 00:52:28.704
Well, six was the wrong answer.
I had to say three.


559
00:52:29.705 --> 00:52:31.576
You don't like me,
do you, Chuck?


560
00:52:34.275 --> 00:52:37.582
Move your elbow, Chuck.
It's in my way.


561
00:52:37.626 --> 00:52:40.237
I can't write with your
elbow in my way, Chuck.


562
00:52:40.281 --> 00:52:42.152
And stop wriggling around so much.

563
00:52:42.196 --> 00:52:44.154
You make the whole desk move.

564
00:52:49.116 --> 00:52:51.118
Sighs can start arguments, too, Chuck.

565
00:52:52.858 --> 00:52:55.165
Move over, Chuck.
You're taking too much room.


566
00:52:56.993 --> 00:52:58.342
Children!

567
00:52:58.386 --> 00:53:00.605
Sorry, ma'am.

568
00:53:00.649 --> 00:53:03.391
My desk partner here isn't very coordinated.

569
00:53:12.139 --> 00:53:14.706
Don't chew on your eraser, Chuck.
It bugs me.


570
00:53:18.014 --> 00:53:21.409
Stop drumming your fingers on the desk, Chuck.
That grosses me out.


571
00:53:25.282 --> 00:53:27.545
And don't hassle me with your sighs, Chuck.

572
00:53:30.635 --> 00:53:33.638
Don't breathe through your mouth, Chuck.

573
00:53:33.682 --> 00:53:36.206
Don't lick your fingers when
you turn the pages, Chuck,


574
00:53:36.250 --> 00:53:38.121
and don't scrape your feet on the desk.

575
00:53:38.165 --> 00:53:39.949
Will you stop criticizing me?

576
00:53:43.387 --> 00:53:46.042
Another fine mess you've
gotten me into, Chuck.


577
00:53:57.836 --> 00:54:00.665
I dread going back to the
chateau after what Pierre said.


578
00:54:02.319 --> 00:54:06.323
I caution you to be very
careful with the Baron.


579
00:54:06.367 --> 00:54:08.673
If he knows you are there...

580
00:54:08.717 --> 00:54:11.372
I could invite you to the
farm to stay with us, Chuck,


581
00:54:11.415 --> 00:54:13.548
but I'm afraid Pierre might get jealous.

582
00:54:13.591 --> 00:54:15.419
He's fallen for me, Chuck.

583
00:54:15.463 --> 00:54:17.291
Maybe you shouldn't walk so close to me.

584
00:54:56.895 --> 00:54:59.420
Snoopy, who set the table?

585
00:54:59.463 --> 00:55:01.770
Our beds are made.

586
00:55:01.813 --> 00:55:03.685
Who did it?
Did you see who did it?


587
00:55:07.210 --> 00:55:08.342
Who did it?

588
00:55:12.389 --> 00:55:14.087
I'm not getting any answers.

589
00:55:35.325 --> 00:55:36.674
Oh!

590
00:55:43.420 --> 00:55:46.597
Maybe we ought to take turns on
watch tonight, Charlie Brown.


591
00:55:46.641 --> 00:55:48.643
I'll take the first watch,

592
00:55:48.686 --> 00:55:50.601
and then you take it from midnight.

593
00:55:50.645 --> 00:55:52.864
I'm worried about the Baron.

594
00:55:52.908 --> 00:55:55.389
Pierre said he was a very mean man.

595
00:56:00.350 --> 00:56:02.396
I hope Chuck and Linus
got into the chateau tonight.


596
00:56:03.179 --> 00:56:05.138
It's cold outside.

597
00:56:05.181 --> 00:56:08.271
Nobody is going to the Mal Voisin.

598
00:56:08.315 --> 00:56:11.753
I remember Violette often
spoke of her grandmother


599
00:56:11.796 --> 00:56:14.059
and an American friend.

600
00:56:14.103 --> 00:56:17.889
During World War II, many Americans
were stationed around here,


601
00:56:17.933 --> 00:56:20.501
and in the Chateau Mal Voisin.

602
00:56:20.544 --> 00:56:23.156
I wish your friends
would leave the chateau.


603
00:56:23.199 --> 00:56:24.809
They could be in danger.

604
00:56:44.089 --> 00:56:46.179
Wake up, Charlie Brown.

605
00:56:46.222 --> 00:56:48.920
It's your turn to stand watch.

606
00:56:48.964 --> 00:56:51.271
Wha, wha, what?
Stand what?


607
00:56:51.314 --> 00:56:53.838
What, what time is it?
Who's on first?


608
00:56:53.882 --> 00:56:56.450
Come on, Charlie Brown, wake up.

609
00:56:56.493 --> 00:56:58.756
It's very quiet.
Nothing has happened.


610
00:56:58.800 --> 00:57:01.150
Okay, I'll take over.

611
00:57:02.020 --> 00:57:04.240
Good night, Linus.

612
00:57:39.274 --> 00:57:43.278
Now, remember.
I'll be at the cafe for an hour or two.


613
00:57:43.322 --> 00:57:45.759
You are not to invite those boys in.

614
00:57:45.802 --> 00:57:48.283
I will just take food to the boys.

615
00:57:48.327 --> 00:57:50.720
I told you, I didn't want any visitors.

616
00:57:50.764 --> 00:57:52.940
Why can't we have peace?

617
00:57:52.983 --> 00:57:56.465
Uncle, you know how mama
felt about Americans.


618
00:57:56.509 --> 00:57:59.294
We have to be hospitable.
No, it's foolish.


619
00:57:59.338 --> 00:58:00.948
You must get rid of them.

620
00:58:00.991 --> 00:58:03.211
I don't want strangers here.

621
00:58:04.865 --> 00:58:06.867
All right, Uncle.

622
00:58:06.910 --> 00:58:09.391
I warn you, get rid of them tomorrow.

623
00:58:09.435 --> 00:58:11.959
I shall return soon.

624
00:59:02.009 --> 00:59:04.272
Argh!
Argh!


625
00:59:59.109 --> 01:00:01.764
I tell you, Francois,
I must get rid of them.


626
01:00:03.549 --> 01:00:06.290
Out! Out!
They must be gotten rid of!


627
01:00:07.857 --> 01:00:12.209
I warned Violette, I didn't
want strangers in the chateau.


628
01:00:12.253 --> 01:00:14.647
If they aren't out tomorrow,

629
01:00:14.690 --> 01:00:18.825
I will have to take some drastic steps.

630
01:00:18.868 --> 01:00:22.829
Yes, tomorrow they will
take the consequences.


631
01:00:23.438 --> 01:00:24.483
Heh, heh.

632
01:00:39.106 --> 01:00:41.804
That Charlie Brown fell asleep,

633
01:00:41.848 --> 01:00:44.590
but I'm going to find out
what's going on in that chateau


634
01:00:44.633 --> 01:00:45.939
once and for all.

635
01:02:08.674 --> 01:02:09.675
Ahhh!

636
01:02:10.632 --> 01:02:12.547
And you must be Miss Violette.

637
01:02:12.591 --> 01:02:15.158
Oh! You should not be here.

638
01:02:15.202 --> 01:02:17.813
But you invited my friend Charlie Brown.

639
01:02:17.857 --> 01:02:20.120
Yes, yes, I know,
but it was a mistake.


640
01:02:20.163 --> 01:02:22.122
You must leave quickly.

641
01:02:22.165 --> 01:02:23.993
But we need to know what's going on.

642
01:02:24.037 --> 01:02:27.170
If my uncle returns and finds you here,

643
01:02:27.214 --> 01:02:28.868
you could be in great danger.

644
01:02:29.608 --> 01:02:31.914
You must leave quickly.

645
01:02:31.958 --> 01:02:34.351
Not until you tell me what's happening.

646
01:02:34.395 --> 01:02:37.485
Well, I have to speak fast.

647
01:02:37.529 --> 01:02:40.836
This started a long time ago.

648
01:02:40.880 --> 01:02:42.925
My grandmother often told me the story.

649
01:02:43.970 --> 01:02:46.581
Here, I'll show you.

650
01:02:46.625 --> 01:02:49.192
This bag belonged to Silas Brown,

651
01:02:49.236 --> 01:02:52.108
Charles Brown's grandfather.

652
01:02:52.152 --> 01:02:55.808
When Monsieur Brown was in
France during the Great War,


653
01:02:55.851 --> 01:02:57.766
he was stationed here at ma maison.

654
01:02:59.072 --> 01:03:01.944
He became good friends with our family.

655
01:03:01.988 --> 01:03:04.077
Especially my grandmother
liked him very much.


656
01:03:05.600 --> 01:03:08.298
As you can see,
he was very handsome.


657
01:03:08.342 --> 01:03:10.779
He looks a little
like Charlie Brown.


658
01:03:10.823 --> 01:03:13.477
And when he finally left the chateau,

659
01:03:13.521 --> 01:03:15.828
Monsieur Brown and my grandmother

660
01:03:15.871 --> 01:03:17.525
wrote letters to each other.

661
01:03:19.658 --> 01:03:21.098
Finally, the letters stopped coming,

662
01:03:21.921 --> 01:03:23.966
and my grandmother married,

663
01:03:24.010 --> 01:03:25.925
and she had a family,

664
01:03:25.968 --> 01:03:28.231
but she never forgot the charming American.

665
01:03:29.755 --> 01:03:32.584
If they are still at the chateau tomorrow,

666
01:03:32.627 --> 01:03:34.803
I will have to take steps
and do something.


667
01:03:36.239 --> 01:03:40.504
I am going to have to get
rid of them in my way!


668
01:03:42.898 --> 01:03:46.119
Francois, something drastic has to be done.

669
01:03:46.162 --> 01:03:47.903
I shall return to the chateau.

670
01:03:48.774 --> 01:03:49.818
Goodbye.

671
01:03:56.303 --> 01:03:58.522
My uncle, the Baron,
hates strangers


672
01:03:58.566 --> 01:04:00.220
and would be very upset if...

673
01:04:01.787 --> 01:04:03.789
Oh, la, la!
He's back!


674
01:04:03.832 --> 01:04:05.442
He mustn't find you here.

675
01:04:14.582 --> 01:04:17.846
Help! Help! Help! Help!

676
01:04:17.890 --> 01:04:20.893
Charlie Brown! Charlie Brown!
Help, please!


677
01:04:21.589 --> 01:04:23.852
Help! Help! Help!

678
01:04:23.896 --> 01:04:27.160
Charlie Brown, help!
Help! Help! Help!


679
01:04:28.857 --> 01:04:32.469
Charlie Brown!
Charlie Brown, help! Help!


680
01:04:32.818 --> 01:04:33.818
Fire!

681
01:04:34.950 --> 01:04:36.212
Charlie Brown!

682
01:04:38.519 --> 01:04:39.912
Help! Help!
Fire!


683
01:04:40.652 --> 01:04:42.044
Ahhh!
Help!


684
01:04:42.523 --> 01:04:44.393
Help!
Help!


685
01:04:44.437 --> 01:04:45.786
Au secours! Au secours!

686
01:04:45.830 --> 01:04:48.006
Fire!
Help! Fire!


687
01:04:48.049 --> 01:04:49.485
Au secours!
Au secours!


688
01:04:49.529 --> 01:04:50.878
Fire! Help! Fire!

689
01:04:51.879 --> 01:04:54.839
Help! Help! Fire!

690
01:05:00.453 --> 01:05:03.325
Help!
Fire at the chateau!


691
01:05:03.369 --> 01:05:06.067
Fire! Fire!
Help! Fire!


692
01:05:06.589 --> 01:05:07.765
The chateau!

693
01:05:08.243 --> 01:05:10.550
Fire!
Help!


694
01:05:11.072 --> 01:05:12.204
Help!
Help!


695
01:05:22.475 --> 01:05:24.259
Help! Help! Help!

696
01:05:24.303 --> 01:05:26.044
Fire at the chateau!

697
01:05:26.087 --> 01:05:28.089
Fire! Fire! Help!

698
01:05:28.133 --> 01:05:30.701
Fire! Fire!
Help! Fire!


699
01:05:31.179 --> 01:05:33.094
The chateau!

700
01:05:34.269 --> 01:05:37.272
Fire! Fire! Help!
The chateau!


701
01:05:37.316 --> 01:05:39.666
Fire! Fire! Fire!

702
01:05:39.710 --> 01:05:43.017
Somebody help!
The chateau is on fire!


703
01:05:43.931 --> 01:05:45.672
Somebody save the chateau!

704
01:05:46.151 --> 01:05:47.892
Fire!
Fire!


705
01:05:47.935 --> 01:05:49.415
I must call the pompiers!

706
01:06:02.036 --> 01:06:03.037
Ahhh!

707
01:06:22.840 --> 01:06:25.451
Au secours! Au secours!
Au secours!


708
01:06:25.494 --> 01:06:27.366
Au secours! Au secours!
Ma petite Violette!


709
01:06:28.367 --> 01:06:30.673
Help! Help!

710
01:06:30.717 --> 01:06:32.850
Au secours! Au secours!
Jump, Linus! Jump!


711
01:06:33.676 --> 01:06:36.070
Jump?
Are they crazy?


712
01:06:36.114 --> 01:06:37.855
Au secours!

713
01:06:37.898 --> 01:06:40.161
Alors, ma petite.
Merci, Monsieur.


714
01:06:52.695 --> 01:06:55.263
Jump, Linus! Jump!

715
01:06:55.307 --> 01:06:58.005
The pompiers are on the way.
Is Linus safe?


716
01:06:58.049 --> 01:06:59.224
Jump, jump!

717
01:07:02.183 --> 01:07:04.925
Use my blanket to catch us.

718
01:07:07.319 --> 01:07:08.668
Jump! Jump!

719
01:07:10.148 --> 01:07:11.366
Ahhh!

720
01:07:28.557 --> 01:07:30.298
Charlie Brown, help!

721
01:07:30.342 --> 01:07:31.822
Help! Help! Help!

722
01:07:32.431 --> 01:07:34.389
Help!
Help!


723
01:07:43.529 --> 01:07:45.444
Help! Help! Help!

724
01:07:48.273 --> 01:07:49.274
Ahhh!

725
01:08:10.251 --> 01:08:11.296
Ahhh!

726
01:09:21.235 --> 01:09:24.064
The Baron is so happy
that we saved the chateau,


727
01:09:24.108 --> 01:09:26.675
he says he'll never be unfriendly again.

728
01:09:26.719 --> 01:09:31.158
This is the first time any outsider
has been in the Chateau Mal Voisin.


729
01:09:31.202 --> 01:09:33.204
You should be proud, Chuck.

730
01:09:33.247 --> 01:09:35.946
Not only did you help save the chateau,

731
01:09:35.989 --> 01:09:38.687
but that's quite a story
about your grandfather, Chuck.


732
01:09:40.907 --> 01:09:43.562
Yes, my grandmother never
forgot the charming American.


733
01:09:44.737 --> 01:09:47.044
Charming?
Wow!


734
01:09:47.087 --> 01:09:50.134
Years went by until they heard the news,

735
01:09:50.177 --> 01:09:52.397
that Silas had married and had a family.

736
01:09:53.224 --> 01:09:54.224
Wow!

737
01:09:54.877 --> 01:09:57.576
Golly!
What a romance.


738
01:09:57.619 --> 01:10:00.796
Things like this don't happen
to gals with big noses.


739
01:10:05.932 --> 01:10:10.023
I heard about MonsieurSilas'
grandson through a friend.


740
01:10:10.067 --> 01:10:13.026
That's you, Chuck.
You're the grandson.


741
01:10:13.070 --> 01:10:16.464
This friend was in America. Wow!

742
01:10:16.508 --> 01:10:20.425
He stopped in this small
village to have his hair cut.


743
01:10:20.468 --> 01:10:22.905
The barber was your dad, Chuck.

744
01:10:22.949 --> 01:10:26.257
Wow.
Did my dad speak French?


745
01:10:26.300 --> 01:10:29.086
I doubt it, Chuck.
Most likely the Frenchman spoke English.


746
01:10:30.870 --> 01:10:33.307
Well, that's how I found out
about Charles Brown.


747
01:10:34.656 --> 01:10:36.615
Not knowing how upset Uncle would be,

748
01:10:37.964 --> 01:10:40.619
I wrote MonsieurBrown the letter,

749
01:10:40.662 --> 01:10:44.666
inviting him to stay with us
during his trip to France.


750
01:10:44.710 --> 01:10:48.061
You never answered her, Chuck.
You never even answered her.


751
01:10:50.977 --> 01:10:52.631
The story's too romantic.

752
01:10:53.284 --> 01:10:54.633
I'm all overcome.

753
01:10:55.634 --> 01:10:57.462
Chuck, this is all wasted on you.

754
01:10:58.550 --> 01:11:00.682
Wasted?
Now, look here...


755
01:11:00.726 --> 01:11:02.989
I guess it's okay, though.

756
01:11:03.033 --> 01:11:05.296
Some of us appreciate a good romantic story.

757
01:11:06.732 --> 01:11:09.474
Some of us understand a pining heart, Chuck.

758
01:11:11.519 --> 01:11:13.652
Linus was the hero, Chuck.

759
01:11:13.695 --> 01:11:15.610
He saved the chateau and Violette.

760
01:11:18.048 --> 01:11:20.920
Boy, am I happy.
I was getting tired of the stable.


761
01:11:20.963 --> 01:11:24.054
Chuck, you have no romance.

762
01:11:27.970 --> 01:11:29.798
Thank you for your hospitality.

763
01:11:29.842 --> 01:11:32.236
This last week has been great.

764
01:11:32.279 --> 01:11:34.020
Au revoir, mon Charles.

765
01:11:35.326 --> 01:11:37.328
This memento is now for you, Charles.

766
01:11:40.200 --> 01:11:41.680
Uh, well, uh, heh, heh.

767
01:11:54.562 --> 01:11:56.520
Boy, not bad.

768
01:11:56.563 --> 01:11:58.174
Too bad I can't
give the kid a tumble.

769
01:11:59.044 --> 01:12:01.264
Hey, Pete, you sly dog.

770
01:12:01.960 --> 01:12:04.136
You kiss pretty good.

771
01:12:04.180 --> 01:12:06.312
Sorry I can't get too serious

772
01:12:06.356 --> 01:12:08.097
about these summertime romances.

773
01:12:10.316 --> 01:12:13.711
That was some experience
at your place, Pete.


774
01:12:13.754 --> 01:12:17.236
Working every day really
got me into great shape.


775
01:12:17.280 --> 01:12:20.065
The kid here had
a good time, too, Pete.

776
01:12:20.109 --> 01:12:21.980
She's just too bashful to say so.

777
01:12:22.894 --> 01:12:24.983
Marcie, show some manners.

778
01:12:25.026 --> 01:12:26.898
Shake Pete's hand.

779
01:12:26.941 --> 01:12:28.639
Tell him you had a good time.

780
01:12:31.337 --> 01:12:33.600
Look at that, Chuck.

781
01:12:33.644 --> 01:12:36.212
Poor Marcie's all broke up about Pete.

782
01:12:36.255 --> 01:12:39.432
Poor kid.
Too bad Pete has fallen for me.


783
01:12:40.825 --> 01:12:43.262
I couldn't give the kid a tumble, though.

784
01:12:43.306 --> 01:12:45.090
He'll just have to get over it.

785
01:12:47.136 --> 01:12:49.877
Okay, okay!
Break it up!


786
01:12:49.921 --> 01:12:52.576
Marcie, stop blubbering.

787
01:12:52.619 --> 01:12:55.179
Pete, you're an okay guy, but we're
going to have to say goodbye.


788
01:12:57.189 --> 01:12:59.974
I know you're all racked up
about my leaving you,


789
01:13:00.018 --> 01:13:01.138
but that's how it has to be.

790
01:13:01.802 --> 01:13:03.935
You'll get over it, kid.

791
01:13:03.978 --> 01:13:06.590
These summer romances aren't for me.

792
01:13:06.633 --> 01:13:09.419
Sorry, kid.
You'll just have to get over it.


793
01:13:10.681 --> 01:13:13.379
Get in the car, Marcie.
Let's go! Let's go!


794
01:13:15.033 --> 01:13:17.166
Goodbye, Pierre.

795
01:13:17.209 --> 01:13:19.298
You've been a great help,
and we appreciate it.


796
01:13:19.342 --> 01:13:21.779
I hope you will come to America someday.

797
01:13:21.822 --> 01:13:25.652
We'll try to be as
hospitable as you have been.


798
01:13:25.696 --> 01:13:28.394
Thank you, Violette, for
inviting us to stay with you.


799
01:13:28.438 --> 01:13:30.744
And thank the Baron
for allowing us to stay


800
01:13:30.788 --> 01:13:33.225
in the chateau this last week.

801
01:13:33.269 --> 01:13:35.706
I'm glad we didn't burn the place down.

802
01:13:35.749 --> 01:13:37.882
Au revoir, Monsieur Linus.
A bientot.


803
01:13:40.798 --> 01:13:41.929
Au revoir, Snoopy.
