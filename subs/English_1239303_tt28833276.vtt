00:08:25.330 --> 00:08:26.497
There's some shoes in here.

165
00:08:26.622 --> 00:08:28.497
She has shoes! Oh my gosh.

166
00:08:28.580 --> 00:08:29.955
Thank you Rebel.

167
00:08:30.038 --> 00:08:31.038
Thank you.

168
00:08:31.122 --> 00:08:33.288
I'm going to go sit
down and put these on.


169
00:08:33.372 --> 00:08:34.955
Oh! Here's my purse.

170
00:08:35.080 --> 00:08:39.580
Let me see if I have a phone
in here that's not shattered.


171
00:08:44.247 --> 00:08:45.455
Please pretty please.

172
00:08:45.538 --> 00:08:46.913
[Sharell] Anything?
Is it working?


173
00:08:46.997 --> 00:08:50.204
No, I don't have one bar.

174
00:08:50.205 --> 00:08:51.913
And it's about to die.

175
00:08:51.955 --> 00:08:55.330
Before it dies, Andre would
want me to document this. Can I?


176
00:08:55.413 --> 00:08:57.872
Yeah. Of course.

177
00:08:57.955 --> 00:08:59.848
[Joli] I'm glad one of us is
married to a lawyer because


178
00:08:59.872 --> 00:09:02.663
we need to sue the crap out
of this private plane company.


179
00:09:02.747 --> 00:09:04.872
[Karla]
Yeah, we do.


180
00:09:04.955 --> 00:09:07.747
Where is the pilot, anyway.
Have you guys seen him?


181
00:09:07.830 --> 00:09:10.538
Rebel was flirting
with him, not me.


182
00:09:10.622 --> 00:09:12.181
I don't even remember
what he looks like.


183
00:09:12.205 --> 00:09:13.830
Well, if he's
underneath that mess


184
00:09:13.955 --> 00:09:16.413
then he doesn't look good.

185
00:09:16.497 --> 00:09:17.747
[Karla]
No he doesn't.


186
00:09:17.830 --> 00:09:20.622
Oh, look at. Rebel even
stuck pills in a shoe.


187
00:09:20.705 --> 00:09:21.913
You have another bottle.

188
00:09:21.955 --> 00:09:23.163
I'll take them. Thanks.

189
00:09:23.247 --> 00:09:24.247
[they both laugh]

190
00:09:24.288 --> 00:09:26.205
[Karla] I'm going to
go look for something


191
00:09:26.288 --> 00:09:27.747
to keep us warm for later.

192
00:09:27.788 --> 00:09:29.288
[Sharell]
You guys...


193
00:09:32.080 --> 00:09:35.497
I know it's tacky, but should
I take pictures of Rebel?


194
00:09:35.622 --> 00:09:38.580
[Joli] No, I get it.
You should do it.


195
00:09:38.663 --> 00:09:40.413
I think so. Right?

196
00:09:40.538 --> 00:09:42.663
We should.

197
00:09:46.913 --> 00:09:48.997
[Karla]
I found one blanket.


198
00:10:00.538 --> 00:10:03.288
[Mark] Head down to the
basement. I'll be right there.


199
00:10:08.663 --> 00:10:10.413
Gentlemen.

200
00:10:10.497 --> 00:10:11.747
So...

201
00:10:11.788 --> 00:10:14.163
What do we think
of the new digs?


202
00:10:14.247 --> 00:10:16.056
[Mark] It's the ultimate
man cave. Just like Vegas.


203
00:10:16.080 --> 00:10:19.455
All night, all the time.
Right?


204
00:10:22.122 --> 00:10:24.872
[Mark] You know, I'm really
glad you guys came by.


205
00:10:24.955 --> 00:10:28.413
I feel like I have,
what I would consider,


206
00:10:28.455 --> 00:10:31.955
the ultimate in reality TV.

207
00:10:32.038 --> 00:10:35.080
You brought us here for
another show launch?


208
00:10:35.205 --> 00:10:36.413
[chuckles]

209
00:10:36.497 --> 00:10:38.205
Not quite.

210
00:10:38.288 --> 00:10:40.205
I mean, you guys know that
I flew the ladies out


211
00:10:40.288 --> 00:10:42.287
to the Whistling
Pines Spa, right?


212
00:10:42.288 --> 00:10:47.080
What you don't know, is
that it doesn't exist.


213
00:10:50.205 --> 00:10:53.413
You want some clarification?
A little more info?


214
00:10:53.455 --> 00:10:54.580
[Mark]
Yeah?


215
00:10:54.663 --> 00:10:56.580
Andre...

216
00:10:56.663 --> 00:10:59.080
Did you know that Sharell was
planning to blackmail you?


217
00:10:59.163 --> 00:11:00.580
Pardon?

218
00:11:00.663 --> 00:11:02.264
[Mark] Yeah, I mean, you've been
giving her the life of luxury


219
00:11:02.288 --> 00:11:03.913
for the last 20 years.

220
00:11:03.997 --> 00:11:07.122
She decides she only wants to
be the political wifey if you


221
00:11:07.247 --> 00:11:12.038
fund her wellness retreat to
the tune of 50 million dollars.


222
00:11:12.122 --> 00:11:14.913
How could you possibly
know all this?


223
00:11:14.955 --> 00:11:18.163
[Mark]
Private detective.


224
00:11:18.288 --> 00:11:19.205
And Jared...

225
00:11:19.288 --> 00:11:20.455
Yeah?

226
00:11:20.580 --> 00:11:22.780
Did you know that Joli recorded
our private conversation


227
00:11:22.830 --> 00:11:27.538
about the trade?

228
00:11:27.622 --> 00:11:29.247
No way.

229
00:11:29.288 --> 00:11:30.830
Way.

230
00:11:30.913 --> 00:11:32.580
She's only going to
make it disappear


231
00:11:32.663 --> 00:11:35.247
if you blow up the prenup.

232
00:11:35.330 --> 00:11:37.497
And my boy Evan.

233
00:11:37.622 --> 00:11:40.830
When are you going to stop Rebel
from making a fool of you?


234
00:11:40.913 --> 00:11:42.954
What are you talking about?

235
00:11:42.955 --> 00:11:44.475
She only wants your
for your trust fund


236
00:11:44.622 --> 00:11:46.497
and she cheats on
you constantly.


237
00:11:46.580 --> 00:11:47.705
No she doesn't.

238
00:11:47.788 --> 00:11:49.747
Ohhh, she sure does.

239
00:11:49.872 --> 00:11:51.163
All the time, man.

240
00:11:51.247 --> 00:11:53.705
All the time.

241
00:11:53.788 --> 00:11:58.372
And my boys, my Karla
has betrayed me.


242
00:11:58.455 --> 00:12:00.788
Unforgivably.

243
00:12:00.872 --> 00:12:02.454
[laughs]

244
00:12:02.455 --> 00:12:06.455
But boy or boy, do I have a
solution to our problems.


245
00:12:20.455 --> 00:12:21.872
What is that?

246
00:12:21.955 --> 00:12:23.455
[Mark]
That?


247
00:12:24.455 --> 00:12:25.955
That's payback!

248
00:12:26.080 --> 00:12:27.497
[Andre]
Is that my Sharell?


249
00:12:27.622 --> 00:12:28.913
That's your Sharell.

250
00:12:28.955 --> 00:12:32.163
And your Joli, and my
Karla and your Rebel.


251
00:12:32.288 --> 00:12:36.455
One plane accident,
four tough lessons!


252
00:12:36.538 --> 00:12:37.913
[Jared]
Joli?


253
00:12:39.788 --> 00:12:41.580
[Evan]
Where's Rebel?


254
00:12:41.663 --> 00:12:43.538
I don't see her.

255
00:12:43.622 --> 00:12:44.913
[Mark] Ah, that's right Evan.

256
00:12:44.955 --> 00:12:48.455
You won the bonus pool.

257
00:12:48.538 --> 00:12:50.622
Rebel died on impact.

258
00:12:59.788 --> 00:13:03.955
Ho ho ho ho.
You got me!


259
00:13:04.080 --> 00:13:05.580
[Evan]
Oh, you got me.


260
00:13:07.122 --> 00:13:09.038
You know I thought you
seriously just told me


261
00:13:09.122 --> 00:13:11.080
that you killed my wife.

262
00:13:11.122 --> 00:13:13.580
[Andre laughs] That's good.
That's good. I was scared too.


263
00:13:13.622 --> 00:13:15.122
[they laugh]

264
00:13:15.288 --> 00:13:18.247
Who did you get to play Joli?
That looks just like her!


265
00:13:18.330 --> 00:13:21.288
That's because it is Joli.
It's not a joke.


266
00:13:23.580 --> 00:13:25.080
You guys!

267
00:13:25.122 --> 00:13:27.413
Come on! I just did
you all a favor!


268
00:13:27.497 --> 00:13:28.538
You sick bastard!

269
00:13:28.622 --> 00:13:29.872
[struggle]

270
00:13:29.955 --> 00:13:31.413
Get your hands off me!

271
00:13:31.497 --> 00:13:34.122
[shouting] I don't think
you guys understand.


272
00:13:34.205 --> 00:13:36.330
We're all in this together now.

273
00:13:36.455 --> 00:13:38.622
We've all just let
our marriages fail.


274
00:13:38.705 --> 00:13:40.872
We all want something different.
We want a change.


275
00:13:40.955 --> 00:13:42.788
Some of us have moved
onto different people.


276
00:13:42.872 --> 00:13:44.098
So you're adding
blackmail to murder?


277
00:13:44.122 --> 00:13:46.413
[shouts]
It's called hedging!


278
00:13:47.872 --> 00:13:51.580
We all do it in
business, every day.


279
00:13:51.663 --> 00:13:53.205
You!

280
00:13:53.330 --> 00:13:55.788
You need a woman to
stand by your side.


281
00:13:55.872 --> 00:13:57.080
And Joli...

282
00:13:57.205 --> 00:13:59.663
She's a ticking time
bomb with that recording.


283
00:13:59.747 --> 00:14:01.497
That recording needs to go away.

284
00:14:01.580 --> 00:14:03.163
And unfortunately...

285
00:14:03.288 --> 00:14:04.747
So do you.

286
00:14:04.830 --> 00:14:06.497
You need to go away.

287
00:14:06.622 --> 00:14:08.330
Walk.

288
00:14:09.413 --> 00:14:10.663
Really?

289
00:14:14.205 --> 00:14:16.330
You shouldn't of lunged at me.

290
00:14:20.122 --> 00:14:22.497
We got to get out
of here right now.


291
00:14:22.580 --> 00:14:23.788
We can't leave Evan.

292
00:14:23.872 --> 00:14:25.672
Mark is going to find a
way to pin this on us.


293
00:14:25.747 --> 00:14:26.622
You want to stick
around for that?


294
00:14:26.747 --> 00:14:27.955
And then we wait.

295
00:14:28.038 --> 00:14:30.997
We got to find a way to
help Sharell and Joli.


296
00:14:32.122 --> 00:14:33.622
[Jared]
And Karla.


297
00:14:35.997 --> 00:14:37.955
Poor Karla.

298
00:14:40.830 --> 00:14:42.580
[Mark]
Come on, buddy.


299
00:14:42.705 --> 00:14:45.872
I know. Let's go. Walk a
little faster too, if you want.


300
00:14:45.955 --> 00:14:47.872
I can't believe you, man.

301
00:14:47.955 --> 00:14:50.247
[chuckles]
It's not that deep.


302
00:14:50.330 --> 00:14:52.330
Have a juice box, a
little relax in there.


303
00:14:52.413 --> 00:14:53.497
You'll be fine.

304
00:14:53.622 --> 00:14:54.830
[beeping]

305
00:14:54.955 --> 00:14:57.412
No no no no. No peeking.

306
00:14:57.413 --> 00:15:00.247
[beeping]

307
00:15:01.205 --> 00:15:02.580
[door squeaks open]

308
00:15:02.622 --> 00:15:05.455
Yeah, the door's for you.
Go ahead. Come on!


309
00:15:06.622 --> 00:15:07.747
Thank you, buddy.

310
00:15:10.663 --> 00:15:11.705
[Mark]
Go on!


311
00:15:12.872 --> 00:15:14.871
Here we go.

312
00:15:14.872 --> 00:15:18.372
Ah, what do you think?

313
00:15:18.455 --> 00:15:21.122
I just want to show you our new
state of the art panic room.


314
00:15:21.247 --> 00:15:23.997
It's pretty sweet, huh?
Check it out.


315
00:15:25.538 --> 00:15:26.997
And check this out.

316
00:15:27.080 --> 00:15:30.330
Do these look familiar?
Of course they don't.


317
00:15:30.413 --> 00:15:34.372
That is what your wife
is sending to other men.


318
00:15:34.455 --> 00:15:37.205
Take some time in here.
Reflect.


319
00:15:37.288 --> 00:15:40.997
Come to grips with what we
know about our precious wives.


320
00:15:41.122 --> 00:15:42.872
Yeah...

321
00:15:42.955 --> 00:15:44.580
Just chill out in
here for a bit.


322
00:15:44.747 --> 00:15:46.288
Have a snack.

323
00:15:46.372 --> 00:15:47.997
No. No no.

324
00:15:52.622 --> 00:15:53.747
Bye.

325
00:15:53.830 --> 00:15:54.830
Wait!

326
00:15:54.913 --> 00:15:55.913
[door slams shut]

327
00:15:58.663 --> 00:16:00.080
Let me out!

328
00:16:02.622 --> 00:16:05.580
[beeping]

329
00:16:07.955 --> 00:16:12.122
[indistinct whispering]

330
00:16:13.163 --> 00:16:14.663
Evan is taking a moment.

331
00:16:21.622 --> 00:16:23.122
[Mark]
Come on.


332
00:16:23.205 --> 00:16:26.121
Let's talk this through.
Have a drink.


333
00:16:26.122 --> 00:16:28.122
[Mark]
You will see the benefits.


334
00:16:31.288 --> 00:16:32.663
Yeah. Yeah, you're right.

335
00:16:32.747 --> 00:16:36.288
Let's have a drink.
We're not going anywhere.


336
00:16:37.372 --> 00:16:40.122
You sound like you really
thought this through.


337
00:16:40.205 --> 00:16:41.955
[Mark]
Absolutely.


338
00:16:42.038 --> 00:16:44.098
How many times have we all said
that we feel like something


339
00:16:44.122 --> 00:16:45.663
is missing in our lives?

340
00:16:45.747 --> 00:16:49.913
That we can't move on because
these women are bleeding us dry.


341
00:16:49.955 --> 00:16:51.455
[Mark]
Huh?


342
00:16:52.747 --> 00:16:55.247
Yeah... Right.

343
00:16:55.330 --> 00:16:56.455
[Mark]
So have a drink.


344
00:16:58.163 --> 00:17:03.080
[Andre] So, ah, bring
us up to speed.


345
00:17:03.163 --> 00:17:04.497
What's the plan.

346
00:17:20.622 --> 00:17:22.913
Don't you guys think
that it's weird


347
00:17:22.997 --> 00:17:24.830
that nobody's come
looking for us?


348
00:17:24.913 --> 00:17:27.372
But we're meant to be at a
surrender your phone spa


349
00:17:27.455 --> 00:17:30.580
weekend, so nobody
knows anything's wrong.


350
00:17:30.705 --> 00:17:33.913
I know Mark, he must be
going crazy right now.


351
00:17:33.997 --> 00:17:35.580
He always has me check in.

352
00:17:35.705 --> 00:17:38.247
And always wants to make
sure that I'm okay.


353
00:17:45.913 --> 00:17:47.747
Ah, I knew it.

354
00:17:47.788 --> 00:17:50.663
I knew these bastards were
stealing from the company.


355
00:17:51.997 --> 00:17:53.788
Babe!

356
00:17:53.913 --> 00:17:57.247
Are you allowed to record
them without them knowing?


357
00:17:57.330 --> 00:17:59.122
I can do whatever I
want to ensure that


358
00:17:59.205 --> 00:18:00.580
my assets are protected.

359
00:18:00.622 --> 00:18:02.538
Even at the cost
of privacy because


360
00:18:02.622 --> 00:18:04.871
I'm pretty sure that
it might be illegal.


361
00:18:04.872 --> 00:18:07.455
Don't be so naive.

362
00:18:07.538 --> 00:18:09.580
While you sit around
doing nothing,


363
00:18:09.663 --> 00:18:13.580
myself and these assets
pay for everything.


364
00:18:13.622 --> 00:18:16.872
I don't sit around
doing nothing.


365
00:18:16.955 --> 00:18:19.247
I take care of the kids.

366
00:18:19.330 --> 00:18:21.955
And they're your kids too!

367
00:18:22.122 --> 00:18:23.913
Yeah, and you do it
all without breaking


368
00:18:24.038 --> 00:18:26.329
a beautifully manicured nail.

369
00:18:26.330 --> 00:18:29.247
Yeah, it's a skill that I have.

370
00:18:33.788 --> 00:18:35.830
I don't ever break a nail.

371
00:18:37.122 --> 00:18:39.580
Okay. I have to be more
proactive than this.


372
00:18:41.872 --> 00:18:44.163
Go. Keep an eye on her.

373
00:18:44.247 --> 00:18:46.247
I'm okay. I'm okay.

374
00:18:55.080 --> 00:18:56.247
[Sharell]
I wish we knew


375
00:18:56.330 --> 00:18:58.413
how far away from
civilization we were.


376
00:18:58.455 --> 00:19:01.080
There could literally be a
strip mall a few miles away.


377
00:19:01.205 --> 00:19:03.580
This is America,
not the freaking Amazon.


378
00:19:03.622 --> 00:19:05.371
Yeah, I agree.

379
00:19:05.372 --> 00:19:06.788
You know what I'm thinking?

380
00:19:06.872 --> 00:19:10.538
We need to find, we need
to find some lights. Right?


381
00:19:10.622 --> 00:19:13.413
How are we going to
see lights in a forest?


382
00:19:13.455 --> 00:19:17.830
Well, we're going to have
to climb up really high.


383
00:19:19.122 --> 00:19:21.247
Like that high?

384
00:19:23.247 --> 00:19:25.913
[Karla] Yeah. I think so.

385
00:19:28.163 --> 00:19:29.913
[Karla] And not we. You.

386
00:19:40.497 --> 00:19:41.913
[Sharell]
Whoo!


387
00:19:42.038 --> 00:19:45.997
Who knew that those climbing
lessons I took would pay off.


388
00:19:46.122 --> 00:19:49.163
I can't believe how
high you climbed!


389
00:19:49.288 --> 00:19:52.038
I can't believe that I
didn't see not one light.


390
00:19:52.122 --> 00:19:53.538
So you didn't see anything?

391
00:19:53.622 --> 00:19:58.747
Nope. There is nothing
around for miles.


392
00:19:58.830 --> 00:20:02.330
I just don't remember being
in the plane that long.


393
00:20:02.413 --> 00:20:04.913
I know. I actually don't
remember a lot either.


394
00:20:05.038 --> 00:20:07.747
But, I mean, we were doing
shots, though, right?


395
00:20:07.830 --> 00:20:08.830
Yeah, we were.

396
00:20:08.913 --> 00:20:09.955
[Joli and Karla chuckle]

397
00:20:10.038 --> 00:20:12.747
I don't remember anything.

398
00:20:12.830 --> 00:20:15.538
[Sharell] Like, I remember
seeing the treetops.


399
00:20:16.705 --> 00:20:21.330
And then nothing.
Like I don't remember anything.


400
00:20:21.413 --> 00:20:23.330
[fluttering sounds]

401
00:20:23.413 --> 00:20:25.580
Sharell, you were
in a plane crash.


402
00:20:25.622 --> 00:20:26.955
[Sharell]
Do you all hear that?


403
00:20:28.122 --> 00:20:29.580
[fluttering sounds]

404
00:20:29.622 --> 00:20:31.455
[Joli] I hope my Zoe
and David are okay.


405
00:20:31.538 --> 00:20:34.497
I know. I always worry when
Mark's alone with Jason.


406
00:20:34.580 --> 00:20:35.413
Why?

407
00:20:35.497 --> 00:20:37.162
Oh, I don't know.
I don't know.


408
00:20:37.163 --> 00:20:38.455
I think it's just because

409
00:20:38.538 --> 00:20:39.598
he doesn't know his
routine, you know.


410
00:20:39.622 --> 00:20:40.622
[fluttering sounds]

411
00:20:40.747 --> 00:20:42.121
[Joli] But he has Janet
with him, right?


412
00:20:42.122 --> 00:20:43.788
Yeah, he has help.

413
00:20:43.872 --> 00:20:45.497
Yeah, so does Jared.

414
00:20:45.622 --> 00:20:49.455
But Zoe gets a little anxious
when I'm away for a few days.


415
00:20:49.538 --> 00:20:51.580
I was going to call her later.

416
00:20:51.663 --> 00:20:53.872
Actually, I had a burner
phone in my luggage.


417
00:20:53.955 --> 00:20:56.247
Yeah, for when the
spa confiscated ours.


418
00:20:56.372 --> 00:20:58.705
Joli! I would have
totally borrowed it.


419
00:20:58.788 --> 00:21:01.997
[Sharell screams]
Ahh! A bat!


420
00:21:03.372 --> 00:21:05.872
What kind of animals
are out there?


421
00:21:05.955 --> 00:21:07.747
[Mark]
So many.


422
00:21:10.038 --> 00:21:11.830
[Andre]
I need another drink.


423
00:21:11.913 --> 00:21:14.997
Maybe two. Anyone else?

424
00:21:15.080 --> 00:21:16.080
[Mark]
I'm good.


425
00:21:17.288 --> 00:21:20.080
Maybe they'll get
eaten by a bear.


426
00:21:20.205 --> 00:21:21.205
[Mark and Jared laugh]

427
00:21:21.247 --> 00:21:22.955
I knew you'd get it.

428
00:21:23.955 --> 00:21:24.955
[glasses clink together]

429
00:21:26.413 --> 00:21:28.788
Yeah, if you're referring
to Evan, I mean, yeah,


430
00:21:28.872 --> 00:21:31.288
I think you just
blindsided him there.


431
00:21:31.372 --> 00:21:32.872
He'll come around.

432
00:21:34.080 --> 00:21:36.038
[Mark]
Yeah, I hope so.


433
00:21:36.122 --> 00:21:38.580
Honestly, I just thought
they'd all die on impact.


434
00:21:38.663 --> 00:21:41.413
That's what the research
said would happen.


435
00:21:42.830 --> 00:21:45.913
Aren't you at all concerned
about them getting out alive?


436
00:21:46.955 --> 00:21:48.872
[Mark]
No.


437
00:21:48.955 --> 00:21:51.038
[Jared]
Why not?


438
00:21:51.122 --> 00:21:53.663
Because I took out a
little insurance policy.


439
00:22:01.205 --> 00:22:02.705
[beeping]

440
00:22:33.455 --> 00:22:36.288
Good night moon.

441
00:22:36.413 --> 00:22:38.622
Good night bats.

442
00:22:39.455 --> 00:22:41.580
Goodnight Rebel.

443
00:23:07.205 --> 00:23:08.405
[twigs crash loudly on ground]

444
00:23:09.622 --> 00:23:13.455
I've never been this happy
to see the sun come up.


445
00:23:13.538 --> 00:23:15.497
[Sharell]
How's your leg?


446
00:23:15.580 --> 00:23:18.663
[Joli] It hurts,
but it's not worse.


447
00:23:18.747 --> 00:23:21.227
[Sharell yawning] The last thing
that you need is an infection.


448
00:23:22.663 --> 00:23:24.830
[Karla]
Get up, I got a plan!


449
00:23:24.913 --> 00:23:28.288
Why are you so perky? Like,
do you have secret coffee?


450
00:23:28.372 --> 00:23:29.747
Or did you actually sleep?

451
00:23:29.788 --> 00:23:31.122
[Karla] No, I didn't
sleep at all.


452
00:23:31.288 --> 00:23:34.330
But it actually gave me time
to really think about this.


453
00:23:34.413 --> 00:23:35.912
No sleep for me either.

454
00:23:35.913 --> 00:23:38.288
Not like this sleeping
beauty right here.


455
00:23:38.372 --> 00:23:40.038
[Sharell stretching]
What?


456
00:23:40.122 --> 00:23:43.080
My trainer says the most
important thing about health


457
00:23:43.247 --> 00:23:44.538
is sleep.

458
00:23:44.622 --> 00:23:46.497
He's had me sleep
training for months.


459
00:23:46.580 --> 00:23:48.413
Hmmm. I'll bet he has.

460
00:23:48.497 --> 00:23:50.080
[Sharell]
Shut your face.


461
00:23:50.205 --> 00:23:52.913
You guys, shut up! Please.

462
00:23:52.997 --> 00:23:55.538
We have to stay unified
if we have any hope


463
00:23:55.622 --> 00:23:58.329
of getting the hell
out of this place.


464
00:23:58.330 --> 00:24:00.913
What? You think we're not
going to make it out of here?


465
00:24:00.997 --> 00:24:03.955
I don't know. I'm not
saying that we won't, but...


466
00:24:04.080 --> 00:24:05.473
[Karla] Do you want
to hear my plan?


467
00:24:05.497 --> 00:24:07.997
Yes. We're sorry.
Of course we do.


468
00:24:08.080 --> 00:24:09.288
Thank you.

469
00:24:09.455 --> 00:24:12.080
Okay, so our husbands, they
think we're at a spa, right?


470
00:24:12.205 --> 00:24:14.580
The spa knows we're not there.

471
00:24:14.622 --> 00:24:16.413
They're going to be
calling our husbands.


472
00:24:16.497 --> 00:24:19.872
[Karla] And then they're going
to come looking for us, right?


473
00:24:19.955 --> 00:24:21.122
Hopefully.

474
00:24:21.205 --> 00:24:22.705
We need to start a fire.

475
00:24:22.788 --> 00:24:25.056
And we need to keep a fire going
because where there's smoke,


476
00:24:25.080 --> 00:24:27.330
there's going to
be rescuers, right?


477
00:24:27.413 --> 00:24:28.747
Oh my God!

478
00:24:28.913 --> 00:24:30.848
Do we literally have to rub

00:32:37.122 --> 00:32:38.913
You know, when you
think about it,


638
00:32:38.997 --> 00:32:41.580
the survival diet
is basically Paleo.


639
00:32:41.622 --> 00:32:42.872
Yeah, that's true.

640
00:32:42.955 --> 00:32:45.264
Except we'd probably have to
kill an animal for the protein.


641
00:32:45.288 --> 00:32:47.538
The only one who's
doing that is Rebel.


642
00:32:47.622 --> 00:32:48.622
Uh huh.

643
00:32:48.663 --> 00:32:50.497
She would be like,
"Rebel versus beast."


644
00:32:50.580 --> 00:32:52.247
"Guess who's gonna
win, bitch?"


645
00:32:52.330 --> 00:32:53.663
My money's on Rebel.

646
00:32:53.747 --> 00:32:56.288
Mine too.

647
00:32:56.372 --> 00:32:57.705
Rebel...

648
00:32:59.122 --> 00:33:01.622
[Karla] Does the smoke
make my skin look good.


649
00:33:01.705 --> 00:33:02.997
Ravishing, darling.

650
00:33:03.122 --> 00:33:05.247
[they laugh]

651
00:33:05.372 --> 00:33:07.330
Man, the sound is garbage
on these cameras.


652
00:33:07.413 --> 00:33:08.538
I can't hear anything.

653
00:33:11.122 --> 00:33:13.830
He's not going to call this
thing off any time soon.


654
00:33:13.913 --> 00:33:14.997
Ya think?

655
00:33:15.080 --> 00:33:16.913
Are we having fun?

656
00:33:16.997 --> 00:33:20.913
Oh yeah yeah.
Hey new place, very luxe.


657
00:33:20.997 --> 00:33:22.663
I know, right?

658
00:33:22.747 --> 00:33:24.413
Yeah, I bought it for Karla.

659
00:33:24.455 --> 00:33:25.872
She just never
wanted to come here.


660
00:33:25.997 --> 00:33:28.830
Yeah, maybe it's got a little
bit too much of a man cave vibe.


661
00:33:28.913 --> 00:33:32.413
How long do you think they
can survive on berries only?


662
00:33:32.497 --> 00:33:36.413
Sharell goes days without
food, all the time.


663
00:33:36.455 --> 00:33:39.497
They are always on some
kind of weird cleanse.


664
00:33:42.122 --> 00:33:43.830
Let me ask you something...

665
00:33:46.622 --> 00:33:49.663
What happens if search
and rescue finds them?


666
00:33:49.788 --> 00:33:51.580
Oh, that's when we say,

667
00:33:51.663 --> 00:33:54.705
Oh my God, honey, I can't
believe this happened!


668
00:33:54.788 --> 00:33:55.997
I'm so sorry.

669
00:33:56.080 --> 00:33:58.163
Had we known we would
have called in for help.


670
00:33:58.247 --> 00:33:59.288
[Jared laughs]

671
00:33:59.413 --> 00:34:01.247
[Jared]
Andre, they're at the spa.


672
00:34:01.413 --> 00:34:03.622
We're not supposed to call.

673
00:34:04.622 --> 00:34:07.080
And you've got the spa
details locked down?


674
00:34:07.122 --> 00:34:09.413
Oh yeah. Oh yeah.

675
00:34:09.497 --> 00:34:12.538
It's a carefully crafted facade.

676
00:34:12.622 --> 00:34:16.247
What if the ladies
wish to visit said spa?


677
00:34:16.288 --> 00:34:18.663
Oh, it's just so exclusive

678
00:34:18.788 --> 00:34:21.069
that they'll never be able to
piece together the location.


679
00:34:21.122 --> 00:34:22.663
And besides...

680
00:34:22.788 --> 00:34:25.913
Do you really think they're
getting on a plane anytime soon?


681
00:34:25.997 --> 00:34:29.205
[Jared]
Come on, Andre.


682
00:34:29.288 --> 00:34:31.014
[Jared] Just enjoy the fact
you might be rid of that


683
00:34:31.038 --> 00:34:32.830
harebrained wife of yours.

684
00:34:32.913 --> 00:34:36.330
[Jared and Mark snicker]

685
00:34:36.413 --> 00:34:40.122
You'll get the sympathy
vote in the next election.


686
00:34:40.205 --> 00:34:42.122
[Mark]
Yeah, he's right, you know.


687
00:34:42.247 --> 00:34:44.622
Women love a widower situation.

688
00:34:44.747 --> 00:34:48.580
You'd be a lock in the

689
00:34:48.663 --> 00:34:50.413
Hmmm?

690
00:34:54.122 --> 00:34:56.163
You're right.

691
00:34:56.247 --> 00:34:57.622
You're absolutely right.

692
00:34:57.747 --> 00:35:00.580
I'm sorry, I just, I just
lost it for a minute there.


693
00:35:02.788 --> 00:35:05.038
I get it.

694
00:35:05.122 --> 00:35:07.287
You're looking at
all the angles.


695
00:35:07.288 --> 00:35:09.247
You're the smartest guy I know.

696
00:35:09.330 --> 00:35:11.538
I wouldn't expect anything less.

697
00:35:14.247 --> 00:35:15.497
Do you guys see that?

698
00:35:15.622 --> 00:35:16.455
What?

699
00:35:16.580 --> 00:35:18.747
It's a bear.

700
00:35:18.788 --> 00:35:20.288
[Mark]
Nice!


701
00:35:20.372 --> 00:35:22.580
That sucker could
do some damage.


702
00:35:42.455 --> 00:35:45.622
[computer boots up]

703
00:35:56.913 --> 00:36:01.747
[airplane roars in sky]

704
00:36:01.788 --> 00:36:04.080
[cries of help]

705
00:36:04.163 --> 00:36:06.080
Oh!

706
00:36:06.205 --> 00:36:07.912
It's so far away.

707
00:36:07.913 --> 00:36:09.455
I know!

708
00:36:09.538 --> 00:36:11.955
You do realize that was the
first plane we've seen all day?


709
00:36:13.122 --> 00:36:14.455
We have to change your bandage.

710
00:36:14.538 --> 00:36:15.913
We don't have another one.

711
00:36:15.997 --> 00:36:17.080
[growling sounds]

712
00:36:17.247 --> 00:36:18.788
What was that?

713
00:36:18.872 --> 00:36:20.122
Oh God, you guys.

714
00:36:20.205 --> 00:36:22.205
I can't deal with anymore bats.

715
00:36:22.288 --> 00:36:24.622
Ah, that didn't sound like bats.

716
00:36:24.705 --> 00:36:26.830
What else is out
here in the woods?


717
00:36:26.955 --> 00:36:29.080
I told you guys I saw a bear.

718
00:36:29.163 --> 00:36:30.372
Oh, Jesus.

719
00:36:30.455 --> 00:36:31.455
Yeah, Jesus was right.

720
00:36:31.538 --> 00:36:32.639
I read about this somewhere.

721
00:36:32.663 --> 00:36:33.872
What?

722
00:36:33.955 --> 00:36:35.455
I'm sure it was
covered in one of your


723
00:36:35.538 --> 00:36:36.747
micro-dosing nature walks.

724
00:36:36.830 --> 00:36:38.080
Joli!

725
00:36:38.205 --> 00:36:39.580
Girl Scouts!

726
00:36:39.622 --> 00:36:41.580
They taught us how
to deal with bears.


727
00:36:41.622 --> 00:36:43.580
Oh, great. Now our
lives depend on


728
00:36:43.663 --> 00:36:45.872
Sharell's distant
childhood memory.


729
00:36:45.955 --> 00:36:48.413
Don't run! Be big!

730
00:36:50.080 --> 00:36:52.122
Okay...

731
00:36:52.247 --> 00:36:53.413
Okay. Wait wait wait.

732
00:36:53.497 --> 00:36:57.621
Don't try to run, be
as big as possible...


733
00:36:57.622 --> 00:36:59.747
Hmmm... That's sounds simple.

734
00:36:59.830 --> 00:37:02.913
Yeah, you know what? I'll
throw you on my shoulders.


735
00:37:02.955 --> 00:37:04.413
[Sharell]
Oh! I got it!


736
00:37:04.497 --> 00:37:07.747
Make noise! Make as
much noise as possible.


737
00:37:07.788 --> 00:37:10.747
Big noises.
The louder the better!


738
00:37:10.788 --> 00:37:12.413
That's comforting.

739
00:37:13.622 --> 00:37:17.372
Good old Girl Scouts
came in handy. [laughs]


740
00:37:17.455 --> 00:37:20.204
I actually hope is
doesn't come in handy.


741
00:37:20.205 --> 00:37:22.747
God, I would kill for a s'mores.

742
00:37:22.788 --> 00:37:23.913
Oh yeah.

743
00:37:23.955 --> 00:37:27.372
Is it time that we eat
our last protein bar?


744
00:37:27.455 --> 00:37:29.122
It's time.

745
00:37:29.205 --> 00:37:30.247
[Sharell]
Yeah.


746
00:37:30.372 --> 00:37:31.455
Okay.

747
00:37:40.413 --> 00:37:42.330
Make it last.

748
00:37:42.413 --> 00:37:44.413
Isn't it strange
that there's been


749
00:37:44.497 --> 00:37:48.455
no sign of any
search and rescue?


750
00:37:51.247 --> 00:37:53.705
Okay, I have to say my peace.

751
00:37:53.788 --> 00:37:54.788
Okay.

752
00:37:54.872 --> 00:37:57.247
Here's the thing.
Today's plan was good,


753
00:37:57.330 --> 00:37:59.287
but we can't do the same
thing again tomorrow.


754
00:37:59.288 --> 00:38:02.122
We need to at least
try and find help.


755
00:38:02.205 --> 00:38:06.163
Okay, so I think that one of
us walks and looks for help


756
00:38:06.247 --> 00:38:08.288
and then the other
one stays with you.


757
00:38:08.372 --> 00:38:10.830
Uh uh. That's not safe.
Out there is unknown.


758
00:38:10.955 --> 00:38:13.747
You need each other.
I'll be fine here.


759
00:38:13.830 --> 00:38:17.330
I'll, I don't know,
just hang out.


760
00:38:17.413 --> 00:38:18.413
[mosquitoes buzzing]

761
00:38:18.455 --> 00:38:20.247
Keep Rebel company.

762
00:38:20.330 --> 00:38:24.247
[chokes] You almost
made that sound fun.


763
00:38:24.330 --> 00:38:25.997
So you'll do it?

764
00:38:26.080 --> 00:38:27.497
I mean, if you're okay with it,

765
00:38:27.580 --> 00:38:30.330
I think that makes
the most sense, right?


766
00:38:30.455 --> 00:38:31.788
Yeah, okay.

767
00:38:39.372 --> 00:38:40.913
We need to move Rebel.

768
00:38:41.038 --> 00:38:42.747
Ah, yeah!

769
00:38:43.747 --> 00:38:45.788
[Karla]
I am so sorry, Joli.


770
00:38:45.913 --> 00:38:49.663
But tomorrow is day three
and she's going to start


771
00:38:49.747 --> 00:38:53.122
attracting animals and that is
not going to be good for us.


772
00:38:54.122 --> 00:38:55.163
I'm going to puke.

773
00:38:55.247 --> 00:38:57.122
I know, but...

774
00:38:57.205 --> 00:39:01.413
It's either that or we move
Joli to another campsite


775
00:39:01.455 --> 00:39:03.746
and build a different fire.

776
00:39:03.747 --> 00:39:08.330
Either way, we can't have a
dead body by the campsite. Dude!


777
00:39:08.413 --> 00:39:11.247
Yeah, I know.

778
00:39:11.372 --> 00:39:12.538
No we can't.

779
00:39:20.122 --> 00:39:21.205

780

[struggling sounds]

781
00:39:39.163 --> 00:39:40.830
I actually, you know what?

782
00:39:40.955 --> 00:39:44.330
I think this is, this
is far enough. Okay?


783
00:39:44.413 --> 00:39:46.997
No. Right over there.

784
00:39:48.038 --> 00:39:50.288
All right. Well...

785
00:39:50.372 --> 00:39:51.913
Thank God for your workouts.

786
00:39:53.372 --> 00:39:54.247
[Karla]
You know what I'm thinking?


787
00:39:54.330 --> 00:39:55.496
No what?

788
00:39:55.497 --> 00:39:57.038
I think we need to
have a memorial.


789
00:39:57.122 --> 00:39:58.247
[Sharell struggles]

790
00:39:58.288 --> 00:40:01.830
So that Joli has
closure with her.


791
00:40:03.247 --> 00:40:04.247
[panting]
Yeah.


792
00:40:04.288 --> 00:40:05.622
Yeah.

793
00:40:07.205 --> 00:40:08.330
- Okay.
- Yeah, okay.


794
00:40:08.413 --> 00:40:09.955
- All right.
- Great.


795
00:40:10.038 --> 00:40:10.872
Okay.

796
00:40:10.955 --> 00:40:12.181
Okay. Let's go,
let's go get her.


797
00:40:12.205 --> 00:40:13.288
[Karla]
Okay.


798
00:40:13.372 --> 00:40:14.788
[Sharell]
Oh God!


799
00:40:14.872 --> 00:40:17.032
[Karla] Thank you for carrying
her the rest of the way.


800
00:40:19.205 --> 00:40:21.038
They do know that the animals

801
00:40:21.122 --> 00:40:22.997
are going to come
for the body, right?


802
00:40:23.122 --> 00:40:26.705
That's probably why they dragged
it away from the crash site.


803
00:40:26.788 --> 00:40:29.497
[Jared] Why are they just
standing there?


804
00:40:31.122 --> 00:40:33.997
[Andre] I think they're
having a funeral.


805
00:40:35.205 --> 00:40:36.747
Go start.

806
00:40:40.122 --> 00:40:42.497
Oh Rebel.

807
00:40:42.622 --> 00:40:46.330
You were such a force
to be reckoned with.


808
00:40:46.455 --> 00:40:48.247
[Karla] You had
the best parties,


809
00:40:48.372 --> 00:40:50.747
the most fabulous wardrobe.

810
00:40:50.872 --> 00:40:52.997
And I think the best thing
about being your friend was


811
00:40:53.080 --> 00:40:56.372
we never knew what was going
to come out of your mouth.


812
00:40:56.455 --> 00:40:59.038
You didn't have a filter.

813
00:40:59.122 --> 00:41:02.080
[Karla] I'm going to send
you off with cedar


814
00:41:02.163 --> 00:41:05.955
because I don't know if
there's moths in the afterlife.


815
00:41:06.038 --> 00:41:09.163
But I know how much
you frickin' hate them.


816
00:41:14.830 --> 00:41:18.288
"The enemy of
cashmere," as she'd say.


817
00:41:18.413 --> 00:41:21.080
[Karla]
Rest in peace, Rebel.


818
00:41:23.205 --> 00:41:24.955
Your turn.

819
00:41:25.038 --> 00:41:26.247
All right.

820
00:41:26.372 --> 00:41:33.580
Ah, Rebel, I know you thought
that my spirituality stuff


821
00:41:33.663 --> 00:41:36.413
was totally bogus.

822
00:41:36.455 --> 00:41:38.830
Maybe it is.

823
00:41:38.955 --> 00:41:45.788
Ah, who knows what happens when
we go off to the afterlife.


824
00:41:45.872 --> 00:41:50.747
I know you also thought that
crystals were designed for


825
00:41:50.830 --> 00:41:54.663
people who couldn't
afford real jewelry.


826
00:41:56.247 --> 00:42:01.497
But I'm going to send you off
with this protection crystal,


827
00:42:01.580 --> 00:42:03.580
nevertheless.

828
00:42:05.913 --> 00:42:07.955
Rest in peace, bitch.

829
00:42:08.955 --> 00:42:11.830
That was nice that
you gave that to her.


830
00:42:11.913 --> 00:42:14.455
Rebel, you were the best friend.

831
00:42:14.538 --> 00:42:17.163
And I want you to
know you were right.


832
00:42:17.247 --> 00:42:22.871
Jared's totally dirty, taking
insider tips, and all of it.


833
00:42:22.872 --> 00:42:24.913
So I did what
you told me to do.

834
00:42:24.955 --> 00:42:27.788
I recorded him giving
illegal information


835
00:42:27.872 --> 00:42:30.080
and I'm going to use it
against him as leverage


836
00:42:30.122 --> 00:42:32.288
to make him to rip up
that stupid prenup.


837
00:42:34.705 --> 00:42:36.622
[Joli] You always give
the best advice.


838
00:42:36.705 --> 00:42:39.080
And the best caviar.

839
00:42:39.205 --> 00:42:43.622
Oh gosh, what am I'm
going to do without you?


840
00:42:43.705 --> 00:42:45.955
Especially over the summer.

841
00:42:46.038 --> 00:42:50.038
[sobbing] Oh gosh, how could
you do this to me?


842
00:42:50.122 --> 00:42:54.163
I'm sorry. It's not about me.

843
00:42:54.247 --> 00:42:57.747
I love you,
and I miss you already.


844
00:42:59.288 --> 00:43:01.330
Rosé all day!

845
00:43:01.413 --> 00:43:03.913
[liquid pouring onto ground]

846
00:43:06.122 --> 00:43:10.372
I am living my best life, Joli!

847
00:43:10.455 --> 00:43:12.580
And looking fabulous doing it.

848
00:43:12.705 --> 00:43:14.913
[laughs]
Put that on my headstone.


849
00:43:14.955 --> 00:43:18.580
That is so morbid.
I will not.


850
00:43:18.622 --> 00:43:24.038
Let's spill more about Karla
and that mogul husband of hers.


851
00:43:24.122 --> 00:43:27.288
My God, they are so
attached at the hip.


852
00:43:27.372 --> 00:43:29.122
[laughs] You do sound jealous!

853
00:43:29.247 --> 00:43:31.372
I am not. Me?

854
00:43:31.455 --> 00:43:32.913
That is so sickening.

855
00:43:32.997 --> 00:43:35.872
I would not have a man all
up in my business like that.


856
00:43:35.955 --> 00:43:38.538
Oh, and what business
is that exactly?


857
00:43:38.663 --> 00:43:41.037
[laughs] Enough about me.

858
00:43:41.038 --> 00:43:44.663
Are you going to tell me
what's going on with you?


859
00:43:44.747 --> 00:43:49.913
I just feel like I've lost me.

860
00:43:49.997 --> 00:43:50.997
Hmmm...

861
00:43:51.038 --> 00:43:55.080
We have to take care
of ourselves. Always.


862
00:43:56.038 --> 00:43:59.288
You are so good at
being in control.


863
00:43:59.413 --> 00:44:05.579
I feel like I have no control
with the kids, the school stuff.


864
00:44:05.580 --> 00:44:10.372
Mostly I just want
to feel alive again.


865
00:44:10.455 --> 00:44:14.247
Is that husband of yours not
giving you what you need?


866
00:44:14.330 --> 00:44:16.788
No, he is.

867
00:44:16.872 --> 00:44:20.205
I just feel empty sometimes.

868
00:44:21.330 --> 00:44:22.330
[splashing sound]

869
00:44:23.330 --> 00:44:25.705
[gulping]

870
00:44:25.788 --> 00:44:27.497
We don't have...

871
00:44:27.580 --> 00:44:29.413
Anymore...

872
00:44:33.122 --> 00:44:35.872
[Joli sobs]

873
00:44:35.955 --> 00:44:38.413
[Karla] Okay, let's go.

874
00:44:38.497 --> 00:44:41.747
[Karla] I actually think
that was really nice.


875
00:44:41.788 --> 00:44:42.788
[Joli]
It was good...


876
00:44:42.872 --> 00:44:44.080
[Sharell]
It was good, yeah.


877
00:44:44.163 --> 00:44:46.038
[Karla] Do you feel like
you had closure, Joli?


878
00:44:46.122 --> 00:44:48.830
[Joli] I'm so traumatized
by it all.


879
00:44:55.830 --> 00:44:58.413
I mean, this is
all very touching,


880
00:44:58.455 --> 00:44:59.931
but it doesn't change
the fact that these women


881
00:44:59.955 --> 00:45:01.830
are evil incarnate.

882
00:45:03.122 --> 00:45:06.872
Do you want to know what
Karla was doing when we met?


883
00:45:08.372 --> 00:45:10.663
She was a barmaid.

884
00:45:10.788 --> 00:45:12.913
Somewhere on the
Upper West Side?


885
00:45:12.997 --> 00:45:14.288
She lived there a long time.

886
00:45:14.372 --> 00:45:17.413
Oh no no no.
A few notches below that.


887
00:45:17.455 --> 00:45:20.038
Yeah, some dive bar in
the meat packing district.


888
00:45:20.122 --> 00:45:22.955
You know, the kind that
have bras hanging from


889
00:45:23.080 --> 00:45:27.538
the old dusty antlers, there's
no doors on the bathroom stalls.


890
00:45:27.622 --> 00:45:31.955
But she was just, so beautiful.

891
00:45:32.038 --> 00:45:35.247
She didn't belong there.

892
00:45:35.288 --> 00:45:37.913
[Mark] So I walk in,
pretending I wanted a drink,


893
00:45:37.997 --> 00:45:41.580
and I just said, Hi.

894
00:45:41.663 --> 00:45:43.038
I thought,

895
00:45:43.163 --> 00:45:48.038
that was my chance to change
someone's life forever.


896
00:45:48.122 --> 00:45:52.080
Well, how come we never
heard this story before?


897
00:45:52.163 --> 00:45:55.122
Because we gave a different
story to our friends.


898
00:45:55.247 --> 00:45:57.413
You know, she was
new to the city,


899
00:45:57.455 --> 00:46:00.080
she lived in a great place
in the Upper West Side.


900
00:46:00.205 --> 00:46:05.955
I did not want to tell you guys
that she lived in a flophouse.


901
00:46:07.330 --> 00:46:14.330
So I molded her, into exactly
who I wanted her to be.


902
00:46:14.413 --> 00:46:22.413
The perfect girlfriend, the
perfect wife, perfect mother.


903
00:46:22.872 --> 00:46:25.913
We had genuine chemistry.

904
00:46:25.997 --> 00:46:29.747
She loved me. I loved her.

905
00:46:29.788 --> 00:46:32.997
It was perfect until...

906
00:46:35.372 --> 00:46:37.080
Until what?

907
00:46:40.622 --> 00:46:43.330
Until she betrayed me.

908
00:46:43.913 --> 00:46:45.288
[glass shatters]

909
00:46:47.455 --> 00:46:50.163
[Mark V.O.] I wasn't
going to have that.


910
00:46:50.247 --> 00:46:53.788
So I came up with
the plan of all plans.


911
00:46:53.872 --> 00:46:57.413
A way to make her pay
for trying to hurt me.


912
00:46:57.497 --> 00:47:02.080
I gave her everything.
Everything!


913
00:47:02.163 --> 00:47:06.288
And she thought she
could just leave?


914
00:47:17.413 --> 00:47:19.372
[Mark V.O.] I wasn't
going to have that


915
00:47:19.455 --> 00:47:22.497
so I came up with
a brilliant plan.


916
00:47:28.538 --> 00:47:30.455
Well, I got to take a leak.

917
00:47:31.580 --> 00:47:34.163
Bing bing...
Bing.


918
00:47:41.538 --> 00:47:45.038
Joli, I understand why
you threatened Jared.


919
00:47:45.122 --> 00:47:46.622
[Sharell]
Me too.


920
00:47:46.705 --> 00:47:49.247
You do everything
for those kids.


921
00:47:49.288 --> 00:47:52.580
You're like his rock.
He doesn't deserve you.


922
00:47:52.622 --> 00:47:55.413
I mean, it does feel harsh
holding this over him.


923
00:47:55.497 --> 00:47:58.413
But Rebel got in my head and
made me think I need to,


924
00:47:58.497 --> 00:48:00.830
you know, think about
my future more.


925
00:48:00.913 --> 00:48:03.163
I gave up my real
estate career for him.


926
00:48:03.247 --> 00:48:05.372
You know, it's not fair.

927
00:48:05.455 --> 00:48:07.538
No, it's not.

928
00:48:11.788 --> 00:48:16.205
Andre is financing my spa

929
00:48:16.288 --> 00:48:19.372
because I threatened to
blow up his campaign.


930
00:48:19.455 --> 00:48:21.622
[Joli]
What?


931
00:48:21.705 --> 00:48:25.162
Oh come on. You suspected.

932
00:48:25.163 --> 00:48:27.538
You are going to
have a great spa.


933
00:48:27.622 --> 00:48:29.747
Yeah, I am.

934
00:48:29.830 --> 00:48:32.872
I just got so sick of him

935
00:48:32.955 --> 00:48:35.747
not factoring me into
his grand plans.


936
00:48:35.830 --> 00:48:38.413
Like I'm over it.

937
00:48:38.497 --> 00:48:40.997
Well, we have to do
what we have to do.


938
00:48:41.080 --> 00:48:42.955
We've got to survive somehow.

939
00:48:43.038 --> 00:48:46.747
Clearly, in more ways than one.

940
00:48:51.080 --> 00:48:55.080
You know, Mark sometimes
gets so angry at me.


941
00:48:55.122 --> 00:48:58.080
To the point where...

942
00:48:59.455 --> 00:49:02.622
To the point where I
can't get him to stop.


943
00:49:04.747 --> 00:49:07.330
What do you mean by stop?

944
00:49:11.538 --> 00:49:12.580
I don't know.

945
00:49:12.663 --> 00:49:16.872
Sometimes I'm afraid,
I'm afraid of him.


946
00:49:16.955 --> 00:49:18.580
Mama, that's not good.

947
00:49:18.622 --> 00:49:20.455
I know. I know.

948
00:49:20.538 --> 00:49:24.247
What are you saying?
Is he violent?


949
00:49:30.788 --> 00:49:33.747
I honestly don't know what
he would do if I left him.


950
00:49:33.788 --> 00:49:35.497
I really don't.

951
00:49:35.580 --> 00:49:39.122
I don't know how I would even
be able to keep the kids safe.


952
00:49:39.205 --> 00:49:40.955
You know, with his resources,

953
00:49:41.038 --> 00:49:43.080
he would be able to
find us anywhere.


954
00:49:43.122 --> 00:49:44.913
He really would.

955
00:49:44.997 --> 00:49:46.162
[Joli] So sorry.

956
00:49:46.163 --> 00:49:49.622
We're here for you, Karla.

957
00:49:49.788 --> 00:49:51.247
We are.

958
00:49:51.330 --> 00:49:53.705
I know you are. Thank you.

959
00:49:56.122 --> 00:49:57.663
Well anyway,

960
00:49:57.747 --> 00:50:01.163
we have got to come up with
a plan and get out of here.


961
00:50:02.580 --> 00:50:04.538
We have to.

962
00:50:07.413 --> 00:50:08.830
Okay, this isn't working.

963
00:50:08.955 --> 00:50:11.872
We got to get out of here
right now and save our wives.


964
00:50:11.955 --> 00:50:15.080
He's not going to
let us out of here.


965
00:50:15.205 --> 00:50:17.038
We have to take him out.

966
00:50:17.122 --> 00:50:18.913
What are we? Mafia?

967
00:50:18.955 --> 00:50:20.330
Take him out. Come on.

968
00:50:20.413 --> 00:50:22.454
Do you even care about Joli?

969
00:50:22.455 --> 00:50:25.830
If we don't get out of here,
Sharell, Joli, Karla,


970
00:50:25.913 --> 00:50:28.205
they're going to die out there.

971
00:50:28.288 --> 00:50:32.162
Okay. We take him out.

972
00:50:32.163 --> 00:50:34.497
How do we take him out?

973
00:50:57.288 --> 00:50:58.872
[Joli]
Just in case. Okay.


974
00:50:58.955 --> 00:51:01.413
Thank you.
Be safe, be safe.


975
00:51:01.455 --> 00:51:03.205
Don't let this
fire go out, okay?


976
00:51:03.288 --> 00:51:05.455
I won't. It's my only source
of entertainment, okay.


977
00:51:06.788 --> 00:51:07.788
[Joli]
Oww!


978
00:51:07.872 --> 00:51:09.080
- So sorry.
- It's okay.


979
00:51:09.122 --> 00:51:11.288
Okay, don't die, okay?

980
00:51:11.372 --> 00:51:13.997
I can't handle another
one of us dying.


981
00:51:14.080 --> 00:51:16.122
You guys be safe
out there, okay.


982
00:51:16.247 --> 00:51:17.747
[Karla]
You too!


983
00:51:17.830 --> 00:51:20.139
You're going to find help before
nightfall. I just know it.


984
00:51:20.163 --> 00:51:21.663
Okay. Bye.

985
00:51:26.788 --> 00:51:28.580
[loud flapping sounds]

986
00:51:28.622 --> 00:51:30.830
[bird cries out]

987
00:51:37.330 --> 00:51:38.913
[Jared]
Are you seeing this?


988
00:51:38.955 --> 00:51:40.247
[Mark]
How's the morning viewing?


989
00:51:40.288 --> 00:51:42.163
I got breakfast beers.

990
00:51:43.247 --> 00:51:44.767
[Andre] They're leaving
the crash site.


991
00:51:44.872 --> 00:51:46.455
This doesn't worry you?

992
00:51:46.580 --> 00:51:48.288
Not at all.

993
00:51:48.372 --> 00:51:52.038
I don't understand
your confidence.


994
00:51:52.122 --> 00:51:53.747
You don't actually
think I wouldn't have


995
00:51:53.872 --> 00:51:57.122
a back up plan, do you?

996
00:51:57.247 --> 00:51:58.580
Come on.

997
00:52:01.997 --> 00:52:04.580
[Karla] Is Andre really
going to run for senator?


998
00:52:04.705 --> 00:52:07.455
Ah, he's been talking about it
nonstop for like two years,


999
00:52:07.538 --> 00:52:09.913
so he's ready to
pull the trigger.


1000
00:52:09.997 --> 00:52:11.580
Is Evan helping him?

1001
00:52:11.663 --> 00:52:15.455
Yeah. Evan's been working
his connections in D.C.,


1002
00:52:15.538 --> 00:52:18.247
taking him to all
these fancy events.


1003
00:52:18.372 --> 00:52:20.413
He's been spending
a lot of time there.


1004
00:52:20.455 --> 00:52:21.855
Are you going to
have to move there?


1005
00:52:21.913 --> 00:52:24.705
Oh God! That's part of the
discussion, you know, like,


1006
00:52:24.788 --> 00:52:27.308
where are we going to live, are
we going to live in both places,


1007
00:52:27.372 --> 00:52:29.163
what's best for the
kids, you know.


1008
00:52:29.247 --> 00:52:32.913
I just, I just don't really
want this to disrupt my life.


1009
00:52:32.997 --> 00:52:34.139
Well, what would
you have to change


1010
00:52:34.163 --> 00:52:35.372
with your life if he wins?

1011
00:52:35.455 --> 00:52:38.121
Ugh! Everything
is scrutinized!


1012
00:52:38.122 --> 00:52:41.788
I'm talking about everything.
Every manicure, every haircut.


1013
00:52:41.913 --> 00:52:44.455
And forget about flying private.

1014
00:52:44.622 --> 00:52:47.122
I thought every single
politician flies private?


1015
00:52:47.205 --> 00:52:50.455
Only for official
government business.


1016
00:52:50.538 --> 00:52:52.747
Well, you know what?
Maybe we can use Mark's jet


1017
00:52:52.788 --> 00:52:54.913
because he's been in a
really good mood lately.


1018
00:52:54.997 --> 00:52:56.788
Oh, my God, you're so sweet.

1019
00:52:56.872 --> 00:52:58.538
But it gets worse.

1020
00:52:58.622 --> 00:53:01.997
He wants to put Jake
in public school.


1021
00:53:02.122 --> 00:53:04.038
Public? Why?

1022
00:53:04.122 --> 00:53:06.455
He's afraid that he's going
to look like an elitist


1023
00:53:06.538 --> 00:53:08.122
by his constituents.

1024
00:53:08.247 --> 00:53:09.122
But he is an elitist.

1025
00:53:09.205 --> 00:53:11.247
I know!

1026
00:53:13.580 --> 00:53:15.205
Forget about me, though.

1027
00:53:15.288 --> 00:53:16.681
I'm really worried
about you, Karla.


1028
00:53:16.705 --> 00:53:19.747
Oh don't be. I shouldn't
have told you all that stuff.


1029
00:53:19.788 --> 00:53:23.663
I mean, are you really
thinking about leaving him?


1030
00:53:23.747 --> 00:53:26.205
I'm terrified.
I'm really terrified.


1031
00:53:26.288 --> 00:53:29.413
I don't know what Mark would do
if he knew I was leaving him.


1032
00:53:29.497 --> 00:53:31.747
Well, what do you
think he would do?


1033
00:53:31.830 --> 00:53:34.247
[bugs buzzing]

1034
00:53:34.330 --> 00:53:35.955
Let's keep going.

1035
00:53:44.288 --> 00:53:46.872
Come on.

1036
00:53:46.955 --> 00:53:50.497
Somebody please look down.

1037
00:53:56.788 --> 00:53:58.598
[Sharell] How long do you
think we've been walking?


1038
00:53:58.622 --> 00:54:02.205
My feet hurt worse than
the last years Met Gala.


1039
00:54:02.288 --> 00:54:04.080
[Karla] Hours...

1040
00:54:05.038 --> 00:54:07.538
[Sharell] How far do you
think that we've come?


1041
00:54:07.622 --> 00:54:09.997
I've no idea. Everything
looks the same around here.


1042
00:54:10.122 --> 00:54:12.663
[Sharell] Oh God, I'd give
anything for a Starbucks.


1043
00:54:12.747 --> 00:54:15.372
[Karla] Or I would kill to
find a ranger's station.


1044
00:54:15.455 --> 00:54:16.913
I'd kill to find a ranger.

1045
00:54:17.038 --> 00:54:18.872
[they both laugh]

1046
00:54:18.955 --> 00:54:20.080
[arrow shot]

1047
00:54:20.122 --> 00:54:22.497
Ah! What the hell!
What the hell!


1048
00:54:22.622 --> 00:54:25.247
[shouting] Hey hunter!
We're not deer!


1049
00:54:25.330 --> 00:54:26.497
[shouting]
Hey you!


1050
00:54:26.580 --> 00:54:28.122
There's no way he
doesn't hear us.


1051
00:54:28.205 --> 00:54:29.205
[shouting]
Hey!


1052
00:54:29.288 --> 00:54:30.431
He can hear us!
[shouts] Hey you!


1053
00:54:30.455 --> 00:54:31.997
[arrow shot]

1054
00:54:32.080 --> 00:54:34.038
Oh my God! Oh!

1055
00:54:34.122 --> 00:54:35.830
- I'm hit!
- [Karla] He got Sharell!


1056
00:54:37.288 --> 00:54:39.330
What the hell is that?

1057
00:54:39.455 --> 00:54:41.247
That's my back up plan.

1058
00:54:41.372 --> 00:54:43.538
[yells]
You hired someone to hunt them?


1059
00:54:46.955 --> 00:54:51.122
You know. You're starting to
sound a little bit like Evan.


1060
00:54:51.247 --> 00:54:53.080
[Mark]
Do we need to go for a walk?


1061
00:54:53.163 --> 00:54:54.747
No no. I just...

1062
00:54:56.455 --> 00:54:58.372
[Andre]
What is the plan here?


1063
00:54:58.455 --> 00:55:00.622
How long is this going to go on?

1064
00:55:01.747 --> 00:55:04.247
[Andre] Can't we let them
live at this point?


1065
00:55:04.372 --> 00:55:06.330
Just call it a big accident.

1066
00:55:06.413 --> 00:55:10.288
Do you think I got to be where I
am by doing things half-assed?


1067
00:55:10.372 --> 00:55:11.848
[Andre] No, no,
it's not that, it's...


1068
00:55:11.872 --> 00:55:14.247
[Mark] How can you not see
that they're traitors?


1069
00:55:14.330 --> 00:55:15.848
[Mark yells]
How were you both not furious


1070
00:55:15.872 --> 00:55:18.663
when you found out what they
were doing behind your backs?


1071
00:55:19.580 --> 00:55:22.205
[Andre]
I already knew.


1072
00:55:22.288 --> 00:55:24.372
Sharell told me weeks before.

1073
00:55:24.455 --> 00:55:26.830
[Jared] Me too.

1074
00:55:26.955 --> 00:55:29.080
We got a lawyer to
work on the prenup.


1075
00:55:31.038 --> 00:55:33.413
What is wrong with you two?

1076
00:55:34.830 --> 00:55:38.913
I mean, have you
no sense of pride?


1077
00:55:38.997 --> 00:55:41.330
[Andre] It's not like
I'm a model husband.


1078
00:55:41.413 --> 00:55:43.080
I've had affairs...

1079
00:55:45.622 --> 00:55:47.413
Can't we just call
this thing off?


1080
00:55:49.913 --> 00:55:52.497
Call this off?

1081
00:55:55.080 --> 00:55:58.872
You know, it's not a bad idea.

1082
00:56:00.580 --> 00:56:04.413
That way, I become the victim.

1083
00:56:04.455 --> 00:56:08.788
And you two become
the prime suspects.


1084
00:56:08.872 --> 00:56:12.122
Oh, I couldn't have
written this better myself.


1085
00:56:17.372 --> 00:56:18.830
You know what?

1086
00:56:20.622 --> 00:56:22.247
[Mark]
I'm not drinking this trash.


1087
00:56:22.372 --> 00:56:24.913
I deserve top shelf. Always.

1088
00:56:43.163 --> 00:56:43.997
[Karla]
Okay!


1089
00:56:44.122 --> 00:56:45.080
[Karla] I know, I know.

1090
00:56:45.122 --> 00:56:46.329
[Sharell whimpers]

1091
00:56:46.330 --> 00:56:47.538
I know, I know, I know...

1092
00:56:49.038 --> 00:56:52.413
[Sharell sobs]

1093
00:56:52.497 --> 00:56:53.830
Oh my God.

1094
00:56:53.913 --> 00:56:55.996
Bitch, you are a drama queen!

1095
00:56:55.997 --> 00:56:57.413
It didn't even go
through your bag.


1096
00:56:57.497 --> 00:56:58.413
- What?
- No.


1097
00:56:58.455 --> 00:56:59.912
No?

1098
00:56:59.913 --> 00:57:01.913
[Karla yells] Come and show
your face, you bastard!


1099
00:57:03.955 --> 00:57:06.163
What the hell?

1100
00:57:06.247 --> 00:57:08.788
There's a camera in the tree!

1101
00:57:08.913 --> 00:57:10.913
This is why we
don't buy knockoffs.


1102
00:57:10.955 --> 00:57:11.955
[smooch]

1103
00:57:22.080 --> 00:57:23.080
Let me try.

1104
00:57:23.122 --> 00:57:24.122
Okay.

1105
00:57:24.247 --> 00:57:25.639
I took a rock throwing
class in Alaska once.


1106
00:57:25.663 --> 00:57:26.747
Of course you did.

1107
00:57:34.413 --> 00:57:35.288
[smashing sound]

00:57:35.372 --> 00:57:36.372
Oh yeah!

1109
00:57:36.413 --> 00:57:37.538
[laughing]

1110
00:57:37.622 --> 00:57:38.913
Good job!

1111
00:57:40.997 --> 00:57:43.455
What is happening?

1112
00:57:43.538 --> 00:57:44.788
I hired the pilot.

1113
00:57:44.872 --> 00:57:46.662
He said he was a
good shot, you know.


1114
00:57:46.663 --> 00:57:48.288
No I didn't know.

1115
00:57:48.455 --> 00:57:49.806
I just want to make
sure everyone gets


1116
00:57:49.830 --> 00:57:51.663
what they want here.

1117
00:57:54.122 --> 00:57:56.080
Sharell...

1118
00:57:56.163 --> 00:57:58.580
Do you think this is
part of a nature study?


1119
00:57:58.705 --> 00:58:00.788
I mean I guess so.
They use them all the time.


1120
00:58:01.913 --> 00:58:03.288
Help!

1121
00:58:03.372 --> 00:58:05.872
Help us please! Help!

1122
00:58:05.955 --> 00:58:08.163
Honestly, I don't that
this is a live feed.


1123
00:58:08.247 --> 00:58:11.705
And even if it is, I doubt
they watch it all day long.


1124
00:58:11.788 --> 00:58:14.080
Oh my God. Sharell...

1125
00:58:16.122 --> 00:58:17.122
Mark's company?

1126
00:58:17.205 --> 00:58:18.205
Shhh!

1127
00:58:20.122 --> 00:58:21.163
What?

1128
00:58:21.288 --> 00:58:23.247
He could be watching us.

1129
00:58:23.372 --> 00:58:24.872
Mark?

1130
00:58:24.955 --> 00:58:26.747
Dude, you're freaking me out.

1131
00:58:26.788 --> 00:58:28.747
Either this was a
location he used


1132
00:58:28.830 --> 00:58:32.372
for one of his survivor shows
and they left the camera, or...


1133
00:58:32.455 --> 00:58:33.955
What?

1134
00:58:34.038 --> 00:58:38.497
Or this whole
thing was a set up!


1135
00:58:38.580 --> 00:58:41.580
I'm sorry, what?

1136
00:58:42.872 --> 00:58:44.038
[Mark]
Come on, Karla!


1137
00:58:44.122 --> 00:58:48.122
Just do it one more
time and better, please.


1138
00:58:48.205 --> 00:58:49.830
Please! Can't we just go?

1139
00:58:49.955 --> 00:58:54.163
I mean, we've gone to so many
black tie events and we're pros.


1140
00:58:54.247 --> 00:58:55.913
We're a power couple.

1141
00:58:55.997 --> 00:58:58.705
Yeah. But it doesn't
hurt to practice.


1142
00:58:58.788 --> 00:59:01.247
Well, I have practiced
so many times for you.


1143
00:59:01.330 --> 00:59:02.913
And you can still improve.

1144
00:59:02.997 --> 00:59:05.288
And besides, the camera
picks up so many details


1145
00:59:05.372 --> 00:59:06.872
that a mirror doesn't.

1146
00:59:08.038 --> 00:59:12.747
Okay, so, uh, what is your
camera picking up on?


1147
00:59:12.872 --> 00:59:17.122
I mean, those earrings.

1148
00:59:19.163 --> 00:59:22.247
What about my earrings?

1149
00:59:22.330 --> 00:59:25.872
You don't really think they
fit your face shape, do you?


1150
00:59:25.955 --> 00:59:28.663
Umm... I don't know.

1151
00:59:28.747 --> 00:59:32.413
I mean I guess I could
try a different pair.


1152
00:59:32.497 --> 00:59:34.413
[Karla] But I do like them.

1153
00:59:34.497 --> 00:59:36.830
Oh, you like them?

1154
00:59:36.913 --> 00:59:41.913
Well, what you like and
what you do reflects on me.


1155
00:59:41.955 --> 00:59:44.348
And if you don't wear the three
carat stud diamonds I bought you


1156
00:59:44.372 --> 00:59:48.497
well I just, I look cheap.

1157
00:59:48.580 --> 00:59:49.872
And that's embarrassing.

1158
00:59:49.955 --> 00:59:51.598
I mean, you wouldn't want
to embarrass me, right?


1159
00:59:51.622 --> 00:59:53.413
Of course not, honey...

1160
00:59:53.497 --> 00:59:54.788
Let's do it again.

1161
00:59:54.872 --> 00:59:55.997
You know the part where you

1162
00:59:56.080 --> 00:59:58.662
introduce yourself to
the board members.


1163
00:59:58.663 --> 01:00:00.372
You like talking to the guys.

1164
01:00:00.455 --> 01:00:02.538
They like talking to you.
Let's do it again. Go!


1165
01:00:02.622 --> 01:00:04.872
Action baby!

1166
01:00:07.288 --> 01:00:08.663
Just give me a second.

1167
01:00:08.788 --> 01:00:10.330
[Mark]
Action!


1168
01:00:16.247 --> 01:00:20.121
Seventeen, eighteen,
nineteen, twenty.


1169
01:00:20.122 --> 01:00:23.997
Okay, Mark, he likes the cameras
to be about twenty feet apart.


1170
01:00:24.080 --> 01:00:26.996
So if he's tracking me, or us,

1171
01:00:26.997 --> 01:00:28.877
there is going to be
another camera around here.


1172
01:00:28.913 --> 01:00:31.122
Okay, wait. Hold on
here one second.


1173
01:00:31.247 --> 01:00:32.830
I got to catch up.

1174
01:00:32.955 --> 01:00:35.913
So you're trying to say that
your husband, Mark Dodds,


1175
01:00:36.038 --> 01:00:40.205
king of reality TV, has
wired an entire forest


1176
01:00:40.288 --> 01:00:44.913
to capture his wife's
survival of a plane crash?


1177
01:00:44.997 --> 01:00:47.372
How did he know the
plane was going to crash?


1178
01:00:47.455 --> 01:00:49.205
Umm...

1179
01:00:53.205 --> 01:00:54.287
Oh!

1180
01:00:54.288 --> 01:00:55.747
Yeah!

1181
01:00:55.872 --> 01:00:59.872
You think that he tried to
kill us for a reality show?


1182
01:00:59.955 --> 01:01:03.747
I know they're out of fresh
ideas, but that is, like,


1183
01:01:03.830 --> 01:01:05.705
taking it a little too far.

1184
01:01:05.788 --> 01:01:08.247
Sharell, it's not for a TV show.

1185
01:01:08.288 --> 01:01:09.663
Okay?

1186
01:01:09.747 --> 01:01:11.955
It's a murder plot.

1187
01:01:12.955 --> 01:01:15.747
Why would Mark try to kill you?

1188
01:01:15.830 --> 01:01:17.830
Ah, maybe there are some
things I haven't told you


1189
01:01:17.913 --> 01:01:19.497
about my marriage.

1190
01:01:19.580 --> 01:01:22.621
You think? Like what?

1191
01:01:22.622 --> 01:01:25.872
Well, how's your
marriage to Andre?


1192
01:01:26.663 --> 01:01:27.747
Good point.

something in the bush


1196
01:01:50.122 --> 01:01:51.288
heading towards Joli!

1197
01:01:51.372 --> 01:01:52.538
[Jared]
What?


1198
01:01:52.622 --> 01:01:54.663
They got bears up there, right?

1199
01:01:54.747 --> 01:01:58.413
Whoa. Joli. Baby,
come on, fight it.


1200
01:01:58.497 --> 01:01:59.829
[Mark]
What'd I miss?


1201
01:01:59.830 --> 01:02:01.681
We don't know. Maybe a
bear headed towards Joli.


1202
01:02:01.705 --> 01:02:03.038
Nice!

1203
01:02:03.122 --> 01:02:04.913
There's no way she's
going to escape that.


1204
01:02:04.997 --> 01:02:07.455
Get em, my furry friend.
Chow down.


1205
01:02:10.997 --> 01:02:13.413
Oh, hey, there! Camera!

1206
01:02:13.497 --> 01:02:15.622
Good eye! Oh good!

1207
01:02:15.705 --> 01:02:17.538
I knew it! I knew it!

1208
01:02:17.622 --> 01:02:22.205
Okay, I went to go visit him on
one of his dumbass TV shows and


1209
01:02:22.288 --> 01:02:24.913
one of the guys there, he
told me how they do this.


1210
01:02:24.955 --> 01:02:27.330
There is going to be a
transmitter somewhere.


1211
01:02:27.413 --> 01:02:28.913
We need to find it.

1212
01:02:28.997 --> 01:02:30.538
If it's around here.

1213
01:02:32.288 --> 01:02:33.455
What the...?

1214
01:02:36.205 --> 01:02:37.830
Don't worry.

1215
01:02:37.913 --> 01:02:40.413
I'm a green light stage three.

1216
01:02:41.747 --> 01:02:44.622
There's a stage three?

1217

Okay, it's going
to be around here.


1220
01:02:58.205 --> 01:03:00.622
It'll be around here somewhere.

1221
01:03:00.705 --> 01:03:02.913
Huh! I think I found it!

1222
01:03:02.997 --> 01:03:04.122
This is a big one.

1223
01:03:04.205 --> 01:03:06.122
[Karla]
Let me see.


1224
01:03:06.205 --> 01:03:08.663
Yeah, this is definitely
the transmitter.

[Rebel] You have
to get your mojo back.


1235
01:03:41.330 --> 01:03:43.455
You make that sound so easy.

1236
01:03:43.538 --> 01:03:47.163
It is. You've got to go
out and do something.


1237
01:03:47.247 --> 01:03:50.080
Go skydiving or go on a safari.

1238

Ah... Yeah. Can I do something
a little more relaxed?

Yes! You have to take
control of your destiny.

No, I'm not.

What I'm going to do, is I'm
going to go over there...

He's going to follow me, okay?

1248
01:04:26.205 --> 01:04:28.497
I'm going to come
back around to you.


1249
01:04:28.580 --> 01:04:30.288
You are going to find a rock

and you are going to hit
him on the head with it.

Are we really doing this?

Yes, we're really doing this.

1253
01:04:37.997 --> 01:04:39.389
But first we've got to
get rid of the cameras


1254
01:04:39.413 --> 01:04:41.497
because he's probably
watching us right now.

How do we do that?

1269
01:06:21.122 --> 01:06:22.330
[Sharell]
I'm scared!


1270
01:06:23.330 --> 01:06:26.247
We got this.
We have this. Okay?


1271
01:06:26.288 --> 01:06:28.747
What if he shoots you?
And then he shoots me?


1272
01:06:28.788 --> 01:06:29.913
Well, then we're dead.

1273
01:06:29.997 --> 01:06:31.038
What?

1274
01:06:31.122 --> 01:06:32.287
We're not going to die, okay!

1275
01:06:32.288 --> 01:06:33.889
I'm going to go over
there, come back around.


1276
01:06:33.913 --> 01:06:35.288
Just have your rock ready, okay?

1277
01:06:35.372 --> 01:06:36.580
- Okay.
- And Sharell...


1278
01:06:36.622 --> 01:06:37.580
Yeah?

1279
01:06:37.622 --> 01:06:39.330
Don't miss!

1280
01:07:01.122 --> 01:07:03.538
Come out come out
wherever you are!


1281
01:07:05.788 --> 01:07:08.955
[laughs]

1282
01:07:09.038 --> 01:07:10.622
Nowhere to run now!

1283
01:07:10.705 --> 01:07:11.747
Sharell now!

1284
01:07:19.288 --> 01:07:20.288
What's happening?

1285
01:07:20.372 --> 01:07:21.288
[Karla]
I'm not quite sure.


1286
01:07:21.372 --> 01:07:22.288
[Sharell]
Is he going to fall?


1287
01:07:22.372 --> 01:07:24.913
Should I push him down?

1288
01:07:24.997 --> 01:07:26.157
[Karla]
Okay, well that works.


1289
01:07:27.580 --> 01:07:28.622
[Sharell]
Look for a phone.


1290
01:07:28.705 --> 01:07:29.705
Oh, okay.

1291
01:07:34.747 --> 01:07:36.913
Oh, got it. Okay...

1292
01:07:36.955 --> 01:07:38.455
Oh, it's locked.

1293

The pilot!

face to unlock it.

Okay.

01:07:49.038 --> 01:07:50.955
[Karla chuckles]
He's such an idiot.


1298
01:07:51.038 --> 01:07:52.913
He put Mark's real
name in there.


1299
01:07:52.955 --> 01:07:54.038
Okay.

1300
01:07:54.122 --> 01:07:55.122
Ah...

1301
01:07:55.163 --> 01:07:56.747

Yes!

Up!

1311

So what do we do now?

We celebrate! Yes!

1313

Mark's sending a car for him.

1314
01:08:41.872 --> 01:08:43.764
How are we supposed to know
where he's sending a car?


1315
01:08:43.788 --> 01:08:44.788
I don't know...

[phone buzzes]

1317

Got the location... Let's go.

I conquer all.

1322
01:09:49.330 --> 01:09:50.497
You ready?

1323
01:09:50.580 --> 01:09:52.913
Ready. Let's do it.

1324

Hey!
[Sharell cocks the gun]


1325
01:10:02.038 --> 01:10:03.872
Are you waiting for someone?

1326
01:10:05.038 --> 01:10:08.913
Okay. I want you to put your
phone and the keys in the car


1327
01:10:08.997 --> 01:10:10.663
and step over there.

Yeah, this bitch is serious.

1330
01:10:14.622 --> 01:10:16.038
Step over there and don't move.

1331
01:10:17.080 --> 01:10:18.997
Thanks for rescuing us.

[Karla]
Oh my God, girl!


1336
01:10:33.872 --> 01:10:35.412
You're such a badass!

1337
01:10:35.413 --> 01:10:36.622
I don't believe it.

1338
01:10:36.705 --> 01:10:38.329
I totally didn't mean
for the gun to go off.


1339
01:10:38.330 --> 01:10:40.247
I almost killed that guy!

1340
01:10:40.288 --> 01:10:41.955
[laughing] You probably
should have.


1341
01:10:42.038 --> 01:10:43.163
Okay okay, all right.

1342
01:10:43.247 --> 01:10:45.413
Let me see where was
the car last. Uh...


1343
01:10:45.497 --> 01:10:49.830
548 Baker Terrace,
Port Credit, New York.


1344
01:10:49.913 --> 01:10:51.205
Where the hell is that?

1345
01:10:51.288 --> 01:10:53.788
[chuckles]
I know exactly where that is.


1346
01:10:53.872 --> 01:10:55.247
Where?

1347
01:10:55.288 --> 01:10:57.580
It's mine and Mark's
country house.


1348
01:10:57.705 --> 01:11:00.580
Whoa. So this really is Mark!

1349
01:11:00.622 --> 01:11:01.705
Yup.

1350
01:11:01.788 --> 01:11:03.014
Okay, call the cops.
Give them the address.


1351
01:11:03.038 --> 01:11:05.163
And then we have to
tell them where Joli is


1352
01:11:05.288 --> 01:11:06.473
so that we can get
her picked up.


1353
01:11:06.497 --> 01:11:07.580
Okay, okay, okay.

1354
01:11:08.288 --> 01:11:09.955
What a prick.

1355
01:11:22.288 --> 01:11:23.997
[Sharell]
Why are we stopping?


1356
01:11:24.080 --> 01:11:26.080
[Karla] Because I don't
want them to hear the car.


1357
01:11:26.122 --> 01:11:28.348
[Sharell] Okay, so what? We're
going to wait here for the cops?


1358
01:11:28.372 --> 01:11:29.913
[Karla]
Well, you can.


1359
01:11:29.955 --> 01:11:31.872
[Karla] I have a score
I need to settle.


1360
01:11:37.788 --> 01:11:38.955
- Karla?
- Yeah?


1361
01:11:39.080 --> 01:11:41.205
[Sharell] Why don't we know
about this house?


1362
01:11:41.288 --> 01:11:42.580
[Karla]
Well, I know about it.


1363
01:11:42.663 --> 01:11:44.622
Mark bought it a long time ago

1364
01:11:44.705 --> 01:11:47.080
to impress his
business partners.


1365
01:11:47.163 --> 01:11:49.372
I haven't been here in months.

1366
01:11:49.455 --> 01:11:51.580
I know where the key is.

1367
01:11:51.663 --> 01:11:54.538
Oh, there it is.
It's in a rock.


1368
01:11:54.622 --> 01:11:56.454
[Karla]
He keeps it right here.


1369
01:11:56.455 --> 01:11:59.372
Okay. Let's go down over here

1370
01:12:00.580 --> 01:12:02.413
[Mark]
Congratulations gentlemen.


1371
01:12:02.455 --> 01:12:03.872
You are now free
to live your lives


1372
01:12:03.955 --> 01:12:06.372
without the shackles of bondage.

1373
01:12:06.455 --> 01:12:08.830
[Jared and Andre]
To freedom!


1374
01:12:08.913 --> 01:12:10.288
That's Andre!

1375
01:12:10.372 --> 01:12:12.580
Shhh!

1376
01:12:12.663 --> 01:12:15.247
We need to get to
the gun safe, okay?


1377
01:12:15.288 --> 01:12:16.288
It's in the panic room.

1378
01:12:16.330 --> 01:12:17.413
Hang on.

1379
01:12:19.288 --> 01:12:22.497
[beeping]

1380

[door opens]

1381
01:12:26.122 --> 01:12:27.122
Come on!

1382
01:12:32.330 --> 01:12:33.997
Evan?

1383
01:12:34.080 --> 01:12:35.080
What are you doing here?

1384
01:12:35.122 --> 01:12:36.080
You're alive!

1385
01:12:36.122 --> 01:12:37.163
Okay...

1386
01:12:37.247 --> 01:12:38.622
Back up.

1387
01:12:38.705 --> 01:12:40.247
You all tried to kill us!

1388
01:12:40.330 --> 01:12:42.705
Your wife is dead!

1389
01:12:42.788 --> 01:12:43.872
No no no!

1390
01:12:43.955 --> 01:12:46.622
I didn't know anything
about this, I swear.


1391
01:12:46.705 --> 01:12:49.580
He threw me in here when I
didn't go along with the plan.


1392
01:12:49.663 --> 01:12:53.163
So Mark did order
the plane crash?


1393
01:12:53.288 --> 01:12:56.122
Yeah.

1394
01:12:56.205 --> 01:12:58.788
Is Rebel really gone?

1395
01:13:00.455 --> 01:13:03.497
He's telling the truth.
He's on our side.


1396
01:13:04.580 --> 01:13:07.413
Evan, I am so sorry.

1397
01:13:07.455 --> 01:13:09.580
She is gone.

1398
01:13:09.663 --> 01:13:13.038
Look, Mark will kill us
all if he finds us in here.


1399
01:13:13.122 --> 01:13:14.830
I know he will.

1400
01:13:15.747 --> 01:13:17.455
Evan...

1401
01:13:18.372 --> 01:13:20.455
Is Andre and Jared
involved in this?


1402
01:13:20.580 --> 01:13:23.455
No. I don't think so.

1403
01:13:23.538 --> 01:13:26.080
He told us all together
in this big reveal.


1404
01:13:32.413 --> 01:13:34.080
Let's go.

1405
01:13:44.913 --> 01:13:46.747
We got to get Evan
out of the panic room.


1406
01:13:46.788 --> 01:13:48.413
Tell him it's all over.

1407
01:13:48.497 --> 01:13:50.955
If it's all over why do
you still need the gun?


1408
01:13:51.080 --> 01:13:53.955
Hasn't any of this
taught you about B plans?


1409
01:13:55.413 --> 01:13:57.955
Okay, go get him. We'll just...

1410
01:13:58.038 --> 01:13:59.622
We'll be right here.

1411
01:14:00.788 --> 01:14:02.747
No!

1412
01:14:02.788 --> 01:14:04.830
We're in this together.
Let's do it together!


1413
01:14:04.913 --> 01:14:08.288
Come on! Go!

1414
01:14:13.872 --> 01:14:16.038
[door opens]

1415
01:14:16.122 --> 01:14:17.122
Evan!

1416
01:14:23.788 --> 01:14:26.163
Okay, there's no way
he got out of here.


1417
01:14:27.872 --> 01:14:29.038
The ducts.

1418
01:14:36.747 --> 01:14:39.622
Hold on hold on hold on.

1419
01:14:47.122 --> 01:14:49.413
He's taken the guns.

1420
01:14:49.455 --> 01:14:51.205
[Mark]
That mother...


1421
01:14:54.872 --> 01:14:57.955
Okay, well he's probably back
at the screens. Let's go!


1422
01:14:58.038 --> 01:14:59.931
[Jared] He's really big and
he's got all the guns.


1423
01:14:59.955 --> 01:15:01.080
You said he has all of them!

1424
01:15:06.122 --> 01:15:07.580
[Jared shrieks]

1425
01:15:08.413 --> 01:15:09.955
Dammit.

1426
01:15:15.455 --> 01:15:17.288
