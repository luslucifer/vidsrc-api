1
00:01:52.766 --> 00:01:54.007
Somebody's looking for you.

2
00:01:55.227 --> 00:01:56.434
Oh, Miss Jeffries.

3
00:01:58.438 --> 00:02:01.647
Good morning, Marcia. I think
we have just what you're looking for.


4
00:02:01.733 --> 00:02:03.816
We always get a good haul
over the Fourth of July.


5
00:02:03.902 --> 00:02:05.234
Good, come on, let's go.

6
00:02:10.867 --> 00:02:12.403
Here she comes, Bill.

7
00:02:21.211 --> 00:02:23.248
Won't you come in?
We'll see what we've got.


8
00:02:23.338 --> 00:02:25.671
Oh, wait a minute,
I forgot my tape recorder.


9
00:02:35.016 --> 00:02:38.509
- Boys, this is Miss Marcia Jeffries.
- How do you do?


10
00:02:38.603 --> 00:02:41.641
Her uncle owns a radio station
here in town. KGRK.


11
00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:44.023
She's been doing
a roving-reporter progranา.


12
00:02:44.109 --> 00:02:46.567
Maybe you've been listening to it.
<i>A Face in the Crowd?</i>


13
00:02:46.653 --> 00:02:48.690
And a mighty nice
little program it is, too.


14
00:02:50.449 --> 00:02:52.441
I know this is a little unusual.

15
00:02:52.534 --> 00:02:55.151
But this morning, she's gonna do
her program from right in here.


16
00:02:55.829 --> 00:02:59.698
So, Miss Jeffries, the jail of
Tomahawk County is at your disposal.


17
00:02:59.791 --> 00:03:04.252
It's very simple. We just talk into
this little microphone in a natural voice.


18
00:03:04.337 --> 00:03:08.627
We just sort of chat back and forth.
Now, look, it's completely informal.


19
00:03:08.717 --> 00:03:15.385
So, if anybody wants to sing a song
or tell an anecdote or funny story...


20
00:03:18.977 --> 00:03:21.720
Let me see, now.
Hey, Beanie, last time you were in here,


21
00:03:21.813 --> 00:03:23.770
seems to me I heard you singing something.

22
00:03:23.857 --> 00:03:26.065
I ain't got my
teeth with me this time.

23
00:03:26.151 --> 00:03:29.269
This is radio KGRK,
the voice of Northeast Arkansas,


24
00:03:29.362 --> 00:03:32.400
bringing you its morning feature,
<i>A Face in the Crowd.</i>


25
00:03:32.491 --> 00:03:34.653
Whose face? Why, it could be yours.

26
00:03:34.743 --> 00:03:38.953
Or yours or yours, because people
are fascinating wherever you find them.


27
00:03:39.372 --> 00:03:42.365
This is Marcia Jeffries,
looking for more faces in the crowd.


28
00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:45.668
This time from the Tomahawk County Jail.
Okay, say something.


29
00:03:45.754 --> 00:03:47.666
Don't worry, Ma, everything's fine.

30
00:03:47.756 --> 00:03:50.544
Nicest jail I've been in
in this part of the country.


31
00:03:56.473 --> 00:03:58.840
Hey, you. You can do something.

32
00:03:59.392 --> 00:04:01.679
Just because I got black skin,
I ain't no minstrel, man.


33
00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:04.934
I'm sorry, Miss Jeffries,
but they're just an ornery bunch.


34
00:04:05.023 --> 00:04:07.811
Say, where's the drunk we taked in
last night with the guitar?


35
00:04:07.901 --> 00:04:10.609
- What's his name?
- Rhodes. That's him lying over there in...


36
00:04:10.695 --> 00:04:12.527
Well, go over there and wake him up.

37
00:04:14.032 --> 00:04:15.364
Better watch him, he's mean.

38
00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:17.470
Miss Jeffries would like to speak
with him. Wake him up.


39
00:04:17.494 --> 00:04:18.610
Hey, wake up!

40
00:04:25.544 --> 00:04:27.752
Morning, Mr. Rhodes, 
I'm from radio KG...

41
00:04:27.838 --> 00:04:30.296
- Get away! Get away!
- The sheriff's here.


42
00:04:30.382 --> 00:04:33.045
I don't care if the President
of the United States is here.


43
00:04:33.134 --> 00:04:35.922
A man can't get
a little decent sleep in jail...


44
00:04:37.848 --> 00:04:38.848
Who are you?

45
00:04:39.391 --> 00:04:41.348
I'd like to introduce you
to our radio audience


46
00:04:41.434 --> 00:04:43.972
- and have you sing a song and spin a yarn.
- Radio?


47
00:04:44.062 --> 00:04:46.874
- Join me in a little back-fence talkin'—
- Wait a minute, wait a minute!


48
00:04:46.898 --> 00:04:48.389
Quit racing your motor.

49
00:04:50.193 --> 00:04:51.434
What do I get out of this?

50
00:04:52.445 --> 00:04:54.937
I mean Mr. Me
-Myself-and
-I.

51
00:04:56.283 --> 00:04:58.696
- Sheriff?
- What's he in here for?


52
00:04:58.785 --> 00:05:00.697
A week. Drunk and disorderly.

53
00:05:01.454 --> 00:05:03.696
I think if you'd cooperate,
I might see my way clear


54
00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:05.601
to let you out of here
first thing in the morning.


55
00:05:05.625 --> 00:05:07.082
Me, too, Sheriff? 
I'm his manager.

56
00:05:08.753 --> 00:05:12.667
Sheriff, the boys in here says
you don't keep your word any too good.


57
00:05:12.757 --> 00:05:15.716
You live up to your end of the bargain,
and I'll live up to mine.


58
00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:20.680
Well, okay. It's a deal. 
Tomorrow morning.

59
00:05:22.225 --> 00:05:23.636
I'll sing you a song.

60
00:05:25.729 --> 00:05:29.643
When I went east to Sarah Lawrence—
that's a college— I majored in music.


61
00:05:29.733 --> 00:05:32.976
And I learned that the real American music
comes from the bottom up.


62
00:05:33.069 --> 00:05:36.688
When George Gershwin played in New York,
it was black-tie music.


63
00:05:36.781 --> 00:05:39.740
But the real beginning of it
was in folks who never owned a tie.


64
00:05:39.826 --> 00:05:43.069
Now, I just bumped into a fella
you never heard of, name of Rhodes.


65
00:05:43.163 --> 00:05:46.372
- Hey, what's your first name?
- Jack or Mac, what's the difference?


66
00:05:47.125 --> 00:05:49.538
Calls himself "Lonesome" Rhodes.

67
00:05:50.962 --> 00:05:51.962
Lonesome?

68
00:05:56.927 --> 00:05:57.927
Hey!

69
00:06:02.265 --> 00:06:05.133
Hey, now, don't be rushing me.
Cut that thing off a minute.


70
00:06:05.936 --> 00:06:08.098
Give me a chance to lubricate
my Adam's apple.


71
00:06:13.151 --> 00:06:14.151
Ah!

72
00:06:15.487 --> 00:06:17.854
Nothing like a little snake medicine
to put you in the mood.


73
00:06:18.448 --> 00:06:19.529
Ain't Mama a beauty?

74
00:06:20.116 --> 00:06:23.530
Oh, a guitar beats a woman every time.

75
00:06:25.121 --> 00:06:28.660
You know, I never have seen a woman
I could trust like this old guitar.


76
00:06:29.501 --> 00:06:31.333
Love my Mama guitar.

77
00:06:33.004 --> 00:06:36.042
She's always there, waiting for me
to pick her up and hold her.


78
00:06:36.132 --> 00:06:39.751
Never asks me for money or goes
cheating around when I ain't looking.


79
00:06:40.387 --> 00:06:44.222
And if she gets a little sour, why,
I just give her a little twist like so,


80
00:06:44.307 --> 00:06:46.390
and we're back in tune together.

81
00:06:46.476 --> 00:06:49.844
- Hey, Lonesome, sing "Rye Whiskey."
- Lonesome.


82
00:06:49.938 --> 00:06:51.429
"Hallelujah, I'm a Bum."

83
00:06:51.523 --> 00:06:53.810
Oh, she can see that plain enough.

84
00:06:55.485 --> 00:06:58.068
You know, ma'am,
whenever a bunch of fellas like us...


85
00:06:58.154 --> 00:07:02.364
outcasts, hoboes, nobodies,
gentlemen loafers,


86
00:07:02.450 --> 00:07:05.409
one-time or all-time losers,
call us what you want to...


87
00:07:06.079 --> 00:07:08.696
whenever we get together,
we tell our funny stories.


88
00:07:08.790 --> 00:07:12.283
Me and Beanie and the rest of these
hand-to-mouth tumbleweed boys


89
00:07:12.377 --> 00:07:13.538
like you see in here.

But deep down,

00:07:33.732 --> 00:07:37.225
when we get ready to tuck our heads
under our wings and go to sleep,


96
00:07:38.153 --> 00:07:39.940
we ain't kidding ourselves.

97
00:07:40.697 --> 00:07:42.814
We're so low-down lonely,

98
00:07:42.907 --> 00:07:46.446
the fella we couldn't stand the sight of
this morning,


99
00:07:47.203 --> 00:07:51.789
tonight, when they get ready to douse
the lights and plunge us into darkness,


100
00:07:53.043 --> 00:07:57.413
why, that same fella seems like
our nearest, dearest buddy.

No, I ain't crying, because I'm gonna be
a free man in the morning.


105
00:08:19.319 --> 00:08:23.063
Ha! You hear that, fellas? A free man!

106
00:08:23.156 --> 00:08:25.022
The sheriff's gonna open this cage,

107
00:08:25.116 --> 00:08:28.860
and I'm gonna be as free as a bird
in the morning!


108
00:08:29.662 --> 00:08:32.905
Hey, maybe I can try
putting a couple of rhymes together.


109
00:08:32.999 --> 00:08:36.117
Ah, sing something dependable,
like "Home on the Range."


110
00:08:36.211 --> 00:08:38.419
I ain't gonna sing
no "Home on the Range."


111
00:08:38.505 --> 00:08:41.873
No, sir, not if it means I rot in here
another month.

00:08:41.966 --> 00:08:44.003

that was just fine.

136
00:10:09.971 --> 00:10:11.803
- You like him?
- Yes, sir.


137
00:10:12.765 --> 00:10:15.849
By golly, Marcia, I think you've
got yourself quite a fella there.


138
00:10:15.935 --> 00:10:17.597
Yep, quite a fella.

139
00:10:17.687 --> 00:10:21.055
I sure would like to use him
on our early-bird show from 7:00 to 8:00.


140
00:10:21.149 --> 00:10:22.640
Would you let me do that, Uncle J.B.?

141
00:10:23.276 --> 00:10:26.735
<i>- Number please, Mr. Jeffries.</i>
- Hello. Get me the jail, Gladys.


142
00:10:26.821 --> 00:10:28.904
<i>- The jail?</i>
- That's right, the sheriff.


143
00:10:29.949 --> 00:10:32.066
Or should I say "our future mayor"?

144
00:10:34.412 --> 00:10:38.122
You know, that boy may be bashful, Marcia,
but he's pretty sweet on you.


145
00:10:38.208 --> 00:10:40.165
The only thing I'm interested in right now

146
00:10:40.251 --> 00:10:42.914
is running the best radio program
in Northeast Arkansas.


147
00:10:44.923 --> 00:10:45.959
Hello, Big Jeff?

148
00:10:48.259 --> 00:10:50.000
- Rhodes?
<i>- Yeah.</i>


149
00:10:50.094 --> 00:10:51.710
That was the agreement, J.B.

150
00:10:51.804 --> 00:10:54.091
I was only holding him
on a drunk and disorderly.


151
00:10:54.182 --> 00:10:56.640
I guess you got no idea
which way he was headed?


152
00:10:56.726 --> 00:10:59.844
There's only two ways out of this town,
and I can't hardly see him going west,


153
00:10:59.938 --> 00:11:02.021
<i>because he just come from jail
over in West Pickett.</i>


154
00:11:02.106 --> 00:11:03.938
<i>You'll likely find him on the east road.</i>

155
00:11:04.442 --> 00:11:05.558
Let's go after him.

156
00:11:08.529 --> 00:11:09.770
There he is.

157
00:11:13.243 --> 00:11:14.529
Hey!

158
00:11:15.536 --> 00:11:18.028
Hi. Morning!

159
00:11:18.957 --> 00:11:22.746
- We've been looking for you.
- Yeah? What for?


160
00:11:22.835 --> 00:11:27.250
Listen, this is my uncle, Mr. Jeffries,
who owns our radio station.


161
00:11:27.340 --> 00:11:30.128
Well, how's it feel to be a free man
in the morning?


162
00:11:32.595 --> 00:11:35.338
- Where you headed now?
- Port St. Joe, Florida.


163
00:11:35.431 --> 00:11:38.390
Well, that's a long walk.
What's down there?


164
00:11:38.476 --> 00:11:42.345
Oh, plenty of water
and plenty of fishing bridges


165
00:11:42.438 --> 00:11:45.397
and snapper boats and tarpon rolling.

166
00:11:45.483 --> 00:11:49.227
You know, I've always wanted
to catch me a tarpon.


167
00:11:49.320 --> 00:11:50.561
What's to stop you?

168
00:11:50.655 --> 00:11:55.867
I can't afford it. I got a radio station,
newspaper, printing business,


169
00:11:55.952 --> 00:11:59.320
president of the Kiwanis.
I can't afford it.


170
00:12:00.248 --> 00:12:02.490
- Come on, Beanie.
- Wait, we wanna talk to you.


171
00:12:02.583 --> 00:12:05.417
Listen, I ain't got but four or five days
to make it to St. Joe.


172
00:12:07.213 --> 00:12:09.330
Unless I steal somebody's car.

173
00:12:09.424 --> 00:12:11.757
Now, you just wait a minute.
We got a job for you.


174
00:12:11.843 --> 00:12:14.836
Every morning on our station,

175
00:12:14.929 --> 00:12:17.012
I don't want no job.

176
00:12:17.098 --> 00:12:20.182
- Why not?
- It's too much like work, man.


177
00:12:20.268 --> 00:12:21.600
You got any money?

178
00:12:21.686 --> 00:12:27.023
Oh, Mama will always get me a little meal.
If it rains, I can sleep in a jail.


179
00:12:27.108 --> 00:12:28.474
Come on, try it for a day.

180
00:12:29.277 --> 00:12:31.735
How about if you had a plane ticket
to Florida?


181
00:12:32.280 --> 00:12:35.569
You can put it in your pocket.
If you ever wanna go, you just go.


182
00:12:39.829 --> 00:12:40.829
Well...

183
00:12:42.165 --> 00:12:45.658
okay. I'll try it for one day.

184
00:12:45.752 --> 00:12:47.334
- I'll turn around.
- Let's go.


185
00:12:52.884 --> 00:12:55.672
Marcia, take him over to the hotel
and get him a room.


186
00:12:55.762 --> 00:12:57.879
Maybe we better clean
him up a little bit.

187
00:12:59.891 --> 00:13:01.098
See you around, Beanie.

188
00:13:06.689 --> 00:13:07.850
Get in the back.

189
00:13:21.913 --> 00:13:24.826

193
00:13:38.805 --> 00:13:41.764
My goodness, ain't we fussy.

194
00:13:43.017 --> 00:13:46.761
Look, this wardrobe you got, I think
I better send it to the laundry for you.


195
00:13:46.854 --> 00:13:50.518
Nah, I'll wash it out myself. That way,
I can cut out anytime I feel like it.


196
00:13:52.443 --> 00:13:53.775
So early in the morning?

197
00:13:54.487 --> 00:13:56.820
How'd you like to come over here
and sort of, uh,

00:13:57.657 --> 00:13:59.093
get acquainted early in the morning?

199
00:13:59.117 --> 00:14:00.824
We really do have to hurry.

200
00:14:01.786 --> 00:14:05.325
I bet you never sat on a hotel bed
with a man before, did you?


201
00:14:05.415 --> 00:14:08.579
Oh, really?
Look, I'll meet you downstairs.

203

Ladies, or I guess I should say "girls,"

204
00:14:25.977 --> 00:14:29.061
boss lady of this here program
just shoved a piece of paper at me


205
00:14:29.147 --> 00:14:30.854
says I ain't got but three more minutes.

206
00:14:31.649 --> 00:14:33.140
That's what I got against working.

207
00:14:33.234 --> 00:14:35.772
It's all tangled up
with that word "hurry."


208
00:14:36.529 --> 00:14:40.022
You know, back in my little old town
of Riddle, we had a cousin named Harry.


209
00:14:40.575 --> 00:14:44.569
We called him Cousin "Hurry"
because he was always running someplace.


210
00:14:44.662 --> 00:14:48.326
Till one day he fell down
a flight of steps and broke his fool neck.


211
00:14:49.834 --> 00:14:51.951
We put a sign on his grave says:

212
00:14:52.044 --> 00:14:54.787
"He was in such a hurry,
he just couldn't wait to get here."


213
00:14:58.050 --> 00:14:59.962
Shucks, I was getting ready
to add on a verse


214
00:15:00.052 --> 00:15:02.009
about being a free woman in the morning.

215
00:15:02.597 --> 00:15:05.010
I bet a whole lot of you
dream about that sometimes


216
00:15:05.099 --> 00:15:07.807
with all them breakfast dishes piling up
in the sink


217
00:15:07.894 --> 00:15:10.432
and them cranky husbands
to get off to work.


218
00:15:10.521 --> 00:15:13.685
Ain't it a shame the way they get on you
about every little old thing


219
00:15:13.774 --> 00:15:16.983
<i>just 'cause they ain't got gumption enough
to take it out on the boss?</i>


220
00:15:17.069 --> 00:15:19.436
Well, good-bye, dear. 
I'm late for work.

221
00:15:19.530 --> 00:15:21.772
<i>I hate to talk against my own kind,</i>

222
00:15:21.866 --> 00:15:24.449
but I never have seen a man yet

223
00:15:24.535 --> 00:15:26.822
could appreciate how hard
you women has to work.


224
00:15:27.288 --> 00:15:30.747
Why, they think running a little water
over a dish is all there is to it.


225
00:15:30.833 --> 00:15:33.291
They never see you cleaning
the grease out of the sink


226
00:15:33.377 --> 00:15:36.165
or wiping out of
the oven the beef gravy

227
00:15:36.255 --> 00:15:39.464
<i>or the apple juice that sizzles over
the side of the dish onto your grill.</i>


228
00:15:39.550 --> 00:15:41.758
Now, how would he ever know that?

229
00:15:42.678 --> 00:15:47.924
Listen to this one. "Dear Lonesome,
though I never set eyes on you..."


230
00:15:48.017 --> 00:15:51.476
Hey, listen. "I know you must be
a saintly-looking man.


231
00:15:51.562 --> 00:15:54.555
Only a saint could understand
the burdens of a housewife like you do."


232
00:15:55.567 --> 00:15:57.432
They all say the same thing. Morning, Bob.

233
00:15:57.527 --> 00:16:00.395
They love his voice, they love his guitar,
they love his ideas.


234
00:16:00.488 --> 00:16:01.899
They should know some of his ideas.

235
00:16:01.989 --> 00:16:03.855
You're not fooling me,
you're proud of him.


236
00:16:03.950 --> 00:16:05.316
Let's work in my office.

237
00:16:05.409 --> 00:16:08.209
Listen, there hasn't been mail like this
since you started the station.


238
00:16:20.216 --> 00:16:21.832
- Hello?
- Shh!


239
00:16:23.886 --> 00:16:25.422
Oh, hello, Wayne.

240
00:16:27.390 --> 00:16:30.508
Huh? Oh, so, you liked the fella, huh?

241
00:16:30.601 --> 00:16:34.220
Okay, I guess we could put you down
for three one-minute spots.


242
00:16:35.773 --> 00:16:37.560
Thanks for calling. Good-bye.

243
00:16:37.650 --> 00:16:40.438
What do you know? Advertisers actually
calling in to buy time.


244
00:16:40.528 --> 00:16:43.145
Looks like this station's liable
to make a little money yet.


245
00:16:43.239 --> 00:16:46.357
I'd go easy on that advertising, Unc,
'cause I don't think he wants to stay.


246
00:16:46.450 --> 00:16:48.988
Marcia, you found him.
Now it's your job to keep him here.


247
00:16:58.504 --> 00:16:59.915
That's the time, honey.

248
00:17:00.006 --> 00:17:03.420
Every time you see this well run dry,
just come over here and prime her again.


249
00:17:03.509 --> 00:17:05.091
That's right, Lonesome.

250
00:17:05.177 --> 00:17:06.977
I'm afraid
that's gonna be your name.


251
00:17:10.975 --> 00:17:13.217
My real intimate friends call me Larry.

252
00:17:14.353 --> 00:17:15.764
You call me Larry, huh?

253
00:17:19.525 --> 00:17:20.686
That's a good chaser.

254
00:17:22.069 --> 00:17:23.560
You always drink like that?

255
00:17:24.447 --> 00:17:27.531
Not always.
Back in Riddle, they was pretty strict.


256
00:17:27.617 --> 00:17:30.234
Didn't allow us to touch hard liquor
till we was 10 or 11.


257
00:17:31.454 --> 00:17:33.411
Now, is there really a town called Riddle?

258
00:17:34.832 --> 00:17:39.167
Well, tell you the flat truth,
it's just a sort of a whatchacallit, a...


259
00:17:39.253 --> 00:17:42.121
- Composite?
- Compost heap's more like it.


260
00:17:43.924 --> 00:17:45.460
Where do you come from?

261
00:17:45.551 --> 00:17:46.883
Oh, from all over.

262
00:17:51.140 --> 00:17:54.554
Any town you mention for 500 miles,
I bet I lived in it a day or two.


263
00:17:55.061 --> 00:17:58.600
- What'd your father do?
- He was a spieler with a two-bit con.


264
00:17:59.857 --> 00:18:03.021
"Now, if each and every one of you
will hand me up your one-dollar bills,


265
00:18:03.110 --> 00:18:06.649
I'm gonna favor you
with a five-dollar gift."


266
00:18:09.075 --> 00:18:10.566
You still loved him, didn't you?

267
00:18:11.160 --> 00:18:13.777
Ran off and left us
when I was knee-high to a beer barrel.


268
00:18:14.997 --> 00:18:16.704
Your mother had to take care of you?

269
00:18:17.875 --> 00:18:19.116
Never mind about her.

270
00:18:21.420 --> 00:18:23.815
What about all those aunts and uncles
you're always talking about?


271
00:18:23.839 --> 00:18:25.080
Uncles?

272
00:18:26.008 --> 00:18:28.421
I wish I had a nickel
for every time I fell asleep


273
00:18:28.511 --> 00:18:30.377
waiting for my old lady to come home.

274
00:18:30.471 --> 00:18:34.010
When I'd wake up, she'd say,
"Shh. Your uncle's sleeping."


275
00:18:34.642 --> 00:18:39.012
I'd say, "Uncle Lou?"
She'd say, "No, this is your Uncle Mike."


276
00:18:39.105 --> 00:18:40.346
Or, "Uncle Moe."

277
00:18:41.399 --> 00:18:45.268
Seems like there wasn't a town in Arkansas
or Missouri I didn't have an uncle in.


278
00:18:47.446 --> 00:18:51.861
Yes, ma'am, my old lady sure was generous
about taking in relatives.


279
00:18:53.160 --> 00:18:55.277
Yet you grew up so happy-go-lucky.

280
00:19:03.254 --> 00:19:05.371
You put your whole self into that laugh,
don't you?


281
00:19:07.341 --> 00:19:11.255
Marcia,
I put my whole self into everything I do.


282
00:19:19.437 --> 00:19:22.680
You mean you turned down an invite from me
to go out with this tramp?


283
00:19:22.773 --> 00:19:26.813
- Why, you wanna fight?
- No, stop it! Stop it!


284
00:19:28.446 --> 00:19:30.529
Mmm!

285
00:19:33.284 --> 00:19:35.150
Thanks for them pies, gals.

286
00:19:36.078 --> 00:19:37.364
You're gonna spoil me.

287
00:19:38.456 --> 00:19:41.290
Well, I reckon I've sung at you enough
for one morning,


288
00:19:41.375 --> 00:19:44.709
so, uh, maybe I ought to wind up
with a joke.


289
00:19:45.296 --> 00:19:46.912
Let's see, um...

290
00:19:48.048 --> 00:19:50.882
Yeah. I got one.

291
00:19:52.094 --> 00:19:53.835
Sheriff Big Jeff Bess.

292
00:19:56.307 --> 00:19:57.718
You say that ain't no joke?

293
00:19:58.350 --> 00:20:01.138
<i>The fact he's running for mayor
strikes me as kind of funny.</i>


294
00:20:02.062 --> 00:20:04.850
You know,
back in my little old town of Riddle,


295
00:20:05.357 --> 00:20:07.770
the way we elect fellas to office is,

296
00:20:07.860 --> 00:20:12.104
<i>we try to figure which fella can best
be spared from useful labor.</i>


297
00:20:12.198 --> 00:20:15.532
Like, you take the village half-wit.

298
00:20:16.076 --> 00:20:19.490
Now, in most places,
he's gonna be put on town relief,


299
00:20:19.997 --> 00:20:22.614
but, now, in Riddle,
why, as economy measure,


300
00:20:22.708 --> 00:20:24.199
we make him the dogcatcher.

301
00:20:24.668 --> 00:20:27.786
But now, uh, this sheriff of yours,

302
00:20:27.880 --> 00:20:30.088
now, of course,
I don't wanna say nothing agin him,


303
00:20:30.174 --> 00:20:33.463
but if you got any mutts around
you wanna get rid of,


304
00:20:33.552 --> 00:20:37.762
just take them over to his place
to see if he can handle the job.


305
00:20:38.474 --> 00:20:40.090
Here, Whitey. Here, Whitey.

306
00:20:53.864 --> 00:20:55.651
Hey, look at that fool!

307
00:21:05.835 --> 00:21:07.667
How does it feel?

308
00:21:07.753 --> 00:21:09.210
How does what feel?

309
00:21:09.296 --> 00:21:11.066
Just saying anything
that comes into your head


310
00:21:11.090 --> 00:21:13.082
and being able to sway people like this.

311
00:21:13.175 --> 00:21:14.791
Yeah, I guess I can.

312
00:21:25.229 --> 00:21:26.595
Yeah, I guess I can.

313
00:21:27.481 --> 00:21:31.930
And now an amusing example
of grassroot democracy in action.


314
00:21:32.027 --> 00:21:34.610
It seems there's a small-town
radio personality


315
00:21:34.697 --> 00:21:38.156
called, uh, Lonesome Rhodes
out in Arkansas


316
00:21:38.242 --> 00:21:41.280
who literally sent a mayoralty candidate
to the dogs.


317
00:21:42.496 --> 00:21:44.704
Larry? Larry?

318
00:21:45.958 --> 00:21:49.076
Listen, just plow right through them.
Keep going and leave the rest to me.


319
00:21:50.087 --> 00:21:52.170
Thanks for bringing up my breakfast,
Laureen.


320
00:21:54.091 --> 00:21:57.175
Mr. Steiner. Larry, this is Mr. Steiner.

321
00:21:57.261 --> 00:21:58.905
He's come all the way from Memphis
to see you.


322
00:21:58.929 --> 00:22:00.090
Mr. Rhodes.

323
00:22:00.180 --> 00:22:03.344
I'm one of the oldest theatrical agents
in the Mid-South.


324
00:22:03.934 --> 00:22:06.301
I book a lot of acts
for the Grand Ole Opry.


325
00:22:07.021 --> 00:22:10.685
I discovered Hank Snow and Webb Pierce.

326
00:22:10.774 --> 00:22:12.731
And the first morning I heard you,

327
00:22:12.818 --> 00:22:15.856
I said to myself,
"Abe Steiner, that man's got power.


328
00:22:16.614 --> 00:22:19.698
Not just catchy songs and funny stories.
Power."


329
00:22:20.659 --> 00:22:23.026
How would you like
to come to Memphis, son?


330
00:22:23.120 --> 00:22:24.120
Memphis?

331
00:22:26.457 --> 00:22:30.326
Mr. Rhodes, you put me in mind of
Will Rogers when he first came to Memphis.


332
00:22:30.961 --> 00:22:34.375
I can make you a star, boy,
if you put yourself in my hands.


333
00:22:36.634 --> 00:22:39.172
Shucks, mister, 
I'm just a country boy.

334
00:22:39.261 --> 00:22:42.504
I ain't even sure I wanna stay
in this danged old radio business.


335
00:22:43.140 --> 00:22:47.601
I'm not one of these high-pressure fellas.
But do you mind if I call you again?


336
00:22:47.686 --> 00:22:48.767
No.

337
00:22:52.024 --> 00:22:53.060
Miss Jeffries.

338
00:22:57.363 --> 00:22:59.696
Grand Ole Opry. 
That's the big time.

339
00:22:59.782 --> 00:23:04.618
It never hurt none to play hard-to-get.
You ought to know about that.


340
00:23:06.205 --> 00:23:08.913
You don't seem to be pining
for lack of company.


341
00:23:09.875 --> 00:23:11.958
I get extra hungry in the morning.

342
00:23:17.007 --> 00:23:20.091
You cold-fish respectable girls.

343
00:23:20.177 --> 00:23:24.091
Inside, you crave the same thing
as the rest of them.


344
00:23:24.890 --> 00:23:29.100
- Tell old Lonesome the truth.
- You're on in eight minutes.


345
00:23:30.437 --> 00:23:32.679
Ooh-wee!

346
00:23:32.773 --> 00:23:35.015
It's so hot this morning,
the creek just give up.


347
00:23:35.609 --> 00:23:39.398
I mean it was bone dry.

348
00:23:40.072 --> 00:23:43.065
So, I think the young 'uns figure
they ain't got no place to swinา.


349
00:23:43.701 --> 00:23:46.489
But my boss, old J.B. Jeffries,

350
00:23:46.578 --> 00:23:50.037
<i>he's got a fine swimming pool
right here in town.</i>


351
00:23:50.124 --> 00:23:53.333
<i>So, why don't all you kids just go on over
to his place for a ducking?</i>


352
00:23:53.711 --> 00:23:56.124
<i>J. B. will be proud to have you.</i>

353
00:24:04.346 --> 00:24:05.962
Jeffries' big day!

354
00:24:07.224 --> 00:24:09.056
...personality, 
Lonesome Rhodes!

355
00:24:09.143 --> 00:24:11.931
You hear them?
You hear them splashing and a-yelling?


356
00:24:13.230 --> 00:24:15.347
That's your curly-headed little darlings

357
00:24:15.441 --> 00:24:19.276
enjoying J.B. Jeffries' kind hospitality.

358
00:24:20.404 --> 00:24:23.238
- Mr. Rhodes. The phone for you.
- Shh! He's on the air.


359
00:24:23.323 --> 00:24:25.406
- That's all right. Who is it?
- Who is it?


360
00:24:26.702 --> 00:24:28.702
It's the program manager
at the Memphis TV station.


361
00:24:28.787 --> 00:24:31.621
- He said Mr. Steiner told him about you.
- Well, shucks.


362
00:24:31.707 --> 00:24:34.074
I can talk to him
right here on the air.

363
00:24:34.168 --> 00:24:36.080
Since all these folks out here
are my friends,


364
00:24:36.170 --> 00:24:38.412
I ain't got nothing to hide from you.

365
00:24:38.505 --> 00:24:39.586
Yeah?

366
00:24:39.673 --> 00:24:41.209
Hello there, partner!

367
00:24:42.801 --> 00:24:47.216
What's that? You want me
to come on your TV in Memphis?


368
00:24:47.306 --> 00:24:52.472
With this kisser of mine? Ha ha!
All I gotta say is, you're a brave man.


369
00:24:53.187 --> 00:24:55.179
Five hundred dollars a week, huh?

370
00:24:55.814 --> 00:24:57.459
- Confederate?
- Five hundred dollars a week?


371
00:24:57.483 --> 00:24:59.190
Shh. We can do better than that.

372
00:25:00.694 --> 00:25:04.313
Partner, leaving Pickett's like leaving
my own flesh-and-blood kin.


373
00:25:04.948 --> 00:25:07.816
Now, if I got to take leave
of these good folks,


374
00:25:07.910 --> 00:25:11.950
why, I'd rather try it gratis,
for nothing, for a couple of weeks.


375
00:25:12.039 --> 00:25:16.158
And if you ain't satisfied,
or if I get homesick for Arkansas,


376
00:25:16.251 --> 00:25:18.493
why, back I come, and nobody gets hurt.

377
00:25:19.296 --> 00:25:22.380
But now, if we find we get along,

378
00:25:23.300 --> 00:25:27.089
you make it, oh, $1,000 a week.

379
00:25:28.639 --> 00:25:30.471
Yeah, you get the idea.

380
00:25:31.767 --> 00:25:36.137
Oh, yeah, and transportation
for yours truly and my little gal Friday...


381
00:25:36.230 --> 00:25:39.689
not to mention Monday, Tuesday,
Wednesday and Thursday— Marcia Jeffries.


382
00:25:46.573 --> 00:25:49.907
I'm glad you're going with him.
Take good care of him for me.


383
00:25:49.993 --> 00:25:52.736
- I'll sure try.
- Take good care of yourself.


384
00:25:53.455 --> 00:25:54.741
Board!

385
00:25:56.500 --> 00:25:57.581
Marcia!

386
00:25:59.253 --> 00:26:02.166
Come on, honey.
Come on, we'll be late. Come on.


387
00:26:02.256 --> 00:26:05.499
- Come on, the train will leave. Come on.
- Board!


388
00:26:06.426 --> 00:26:10.420
Bye! Bye, Lucy. So long, Luther.
You write to me, now.


389
00:26:10.514 --> 00:26:12.380
I'll be thinking of you good people.

390
00:26:12.474 --> 00:26:14.511
Boy, am I glad to shake that dump.

391
00:26:15.727 --> 00:26:17.684
I was only kidding, honey.

392
00:26:17.771 --> 00:26:20.730
You ought to know me better
than to believe everything I say.


393
00:26:21.817 --> 00:26:27.859
Ha! Bye! Bye! Good-bye
and God bless you, good people!


394
00:26:57.394 --> 00:27:00.387
If I'd known you was gonna put lipstick
on me, I'd have never come.


395
00:27:00.480 --> 00:27:03.439
Stop complaining, you look beautiful.
Lonesome, this is Mel Miller.


396
00:27:03.525 --> 00:27:05.205
The station's assigned him as your writer.

397
00:27:05.903 --> 00:27:08.896
Writer? You're gonna have
the easiest job in the world


398
00:27:08.989 --> 00:27:10.855
because I never learned much reading.

399
00:27:10.949 --> 00:27:13.111
I'll just block out
the continuity for you.


400
00:27:14.203 --> 00:27:15.990
What are you, Eastern college?

401
00:27:16.079 --> 00:27:18.446
No, as a matter of fact,
I went to school over in Nashville.


402
00:27:18.540 --> 00:27:20.076
I was Vanderbilt '44.

403
00:27:20.918 --> 00:27:23.285
Okay, Vanderbilt '44.

404
00:27:24.004 --> 00:27:25.916
Mr. Rhodes, we're ready for you now.

405
00:27:27.674 --> 00:27:29.586
Hey, what are you doing to that makeup?

406
00:27:32.638 --> 00:27:34.004
Now, this way, please.

407
00:27:37.643 --> 00:27:41.262
Foot up here, look at the camera.
And relaxed, like this.


408
00:27:44.274 --> 00:27:46.857
Ten seconds. Ready on one. 
Stand by, two.

409
00:27:47.444 --> 00:27:51.233
And just be perfectly natural,
easy and relaxed, and real country.


410
00:27:51.323 --> 00:27:54.691
Now, when that red light is on,
that camera is on you.


411
00:27:54.785 --> 00:27:56.492
Now, put this in your mouth.

412
00:27:58.830 --> 00:28:01.288
I think that straw
is gonna be a very nice touch.


413
00:28:04.044 --> 00:28:07.208
And here he is, ladies and gentlemen,
a newcomer to Memphis television


414
00:28:07.297 --> 00:28:09.254
but sure to become an old friend.

415
00:28:09.341 --> 00:28:13.460
<i>A Face in the Crowd,</i> starring that
Arkansas traveler Lonesome Rhodes.


416
00:28:15.389 --> 00:28:16.470
What do you want?

417
00:28:19.309 --> 00:28:20.309
Howdy.

418
00:28:22.145 --> 00:28:25.104
You know, I never have seen myself
on one of these things before.


419
00:28:25.899 --> 00:28:31.520
So, if I stop and admire myself
on this, uh... what do you call it?


420
00:28:32.364 --> 00:28:34.276
- Monitor.
- Yeah, monitor.


421
00:28:34.992 --> 00:28:36.949
Show the folks what I'm talking about,
will you?


422
00:28:43.458 --> 00:28:46.872
You know, the, uh...
the director said all I had to do was...


423
00:28:46.962 --> 00:28:47.962
Well.

424
00:28:48.380 --> 00:28:51.623
He said all I had to do was act
like I was looking straight at you.


425
00:28:53.593 --> 00:28:56.336
But what he forgot to say
was there'd be a great big, old red eye


426
00:28:56.430 --> 00:28:57.887
looking straight at me.

427
00:28:59.349 --> 00:29:02.057
You know, that old eye does look
kind of familiar, though.


428
00:29:03.103 --> 00:29:04.719
Reminds me of my old Uncle Abernathy

429
00:29:04.813 --> 00:29:08.397
after a night of drinking
that fine old five-star corn liquor.


430
00:29:10.485 --> 00:29:13.102
He put a star on the bottle
for every day it aged.


431
00:29:19.411 --> 00:29:24.031
<i>♪ If a ocean was moonshine
And I was a duck ♪</i>


432
00:29:24.124 --> 00:29:25.615
<i>♪ I'd dive... ♪</i>

433
00:29:27.336 --> 00:29:30.500
I got too hot a fire in my boiler
to sing this morning.


434
00:29:31.423 --> 00:29:33.756
What's the matter
with you big-city fellas, anyhow?


435
00:29:33.842 --> 00:29:36.835
Hey. Don't you all ever go to bed
around here?


436
00:29:37.429 --> 00:29:40.797
Last night I settled down
for my 12-hour nap in the hotel,


437
00:29:40.891 --> 00:29:43.679
and "moly hoses," what a honking

438
00:29:43.769 --> 00:29:46.807
and lights flashing on and off
and gals giggling on the street.


439
00:29:46.897 --> 00:29:50.732
So, I called down to the desk
on this telephone they got in every room.


440
00:29:50.817 --> 00:29:52.729
"What's going on here?"
I says to the clerk.


441
00:29:52.819 --> 00:29:54.776
"It ain't New Year's Eve by any chance?"

442
00:29:55.447 --> 00:30:00.317
"No," he said.
"It's just 10:00 at night in Memphis."


443
00:30:00.410 --> 00:30:02.117
So I pulled back on my duds

444
00:30:02.204 --> 00:30:04.947
and I went outdoors to take a look-see
what all the commotion was.


445
00:30:05.582 --> 00:30:09.246
Hey. Hey, Mr. Cameraman,
move that old red eye a little closer.


446
00:30:09.336 --> 00:30:11.522
He's only been on two minutes
and already telling us what to do.


447
00:30:11.546 --> 00:30:14.334
I wanna talk face-to-face
with them friends of mine out there.


448
00:30:16.009 --> 00:30:18.171
Hey, which one of
these holes I look in?

449
00:30:19.096 --> 00:30:20.096
Yeah.

450
00:30:22.516 --> 00:30:25.850
You know, one thing I could see right off
about a big city,


451
00:30:26.686 --> 00:30:29.599
there's a whole lot of people in trouble
out there.


452
00:30:30.273 --> 00:30:31.889
You don't see it much in the daytime

453
00:30:31.983 --> 00:30:34.145
when everybody's hustling
and bustling around,


454
00:30:34.236 --> 00:30:36.728
rushing from where they is
to where they ain't.


455
00:30:37.239 --> 00:30:39.606
But it's at night, you know,
late at night,


456
00:30:39.699 --> 00:30:43.318
around 4:00 in the morning
is what I call the "dividing line."


457
00:30:44.454 --> 00:30:47.197
All you got left
then is folks in trouble.

458
00:30:48.250 --> 00:30:51.288
I wanna tell you good people something
that happened to me this morning


459
00:30:51.378 --> 00:30:53.210
just before the sun
was ready to come up.

460
00:30:54.423 --> 00:30:55.914
I'm gonna tell it to you,

461
00:30:56.007 --> 00:30:58.420
and see if it don't happen to you
the way it happened to me.


462
00:30:59.052 --> 00:31:01.419
If it don't move your hearts
the way I think it will,


463
00:31:01.513 --> 00:31:03.926
then you're just a bunch
of big-city pickle-hearts.


464
00:31:04.015 --> 00:31:07.179
And I'm gonna pack up my one shirt
and the old Bible my daddy give me


465
00:31:07.269 --> 00:31:11.058
and my cigar-box guitar,
and I'll just get me on home to Riddle.


466
00:31:11.982 --> 00:31:15.942
He's telling the truth about one shirt,
but I have yet to see the Bible.


467
00:31:16.027 --> 00:31:19.316
When he talks about walking the night,
I couldn't write it that well.


468
00:31:19.865 --> 00:31:21.151
Now, come on out here.

469
00:31:21.241 --> 00:31:24.234
Don't be scared of this thing,
least any more than I am.


470
00:31:24.327 --> 00:31:25.568
This one?

471
00:31:25.662 --> 00:31:28.655
Hey, a colored woman.
In Memphis, that takes nerve.


472
00:31:29.124 --> 00:31:31.241
I told you, he's his own man.

473
00:31:31.334 --> 00:31:33.997
Now, you just tell the folks
the same thing you told me.


474
00:31:34.087 --> 00:31:36.204
Well, you see, it's my house.

475
00:31:36.923 --> 00:31:40.166
It burnt down. She's got seven young 'uns
and there ain't no insurance.


476
00:31:40.260 --> 00:31:45.881
Oh, Hilda, look who they're having
on television now. It's about time.


477
00:31:45.974 --> 00:31:48.216
So she just walked around and around

478
00:31:48.310 --> 00:31:50.518
because she didn't have
no place else to go.


479
00:31:50.604 --> 00:31:53.347
I didn't know a single living soul
in Memphis.


480
00:31:53.982 --> 00:31:55.769
Are you kidding?

481
00:31:55.859 --> 00:31:59.148
What do you gonna bet
you got 20,000 friends out there?


482
00:31:59.237 --> 00:32:01.194
And each one of them's ready
to prove it to you


483
00:32:01.281 --> 00:32:04.024
by sending in half a buck
so you can get on back to Millington


484
00:32:04.117 --> 00:32:06.575
and build a decent house
for them brats that are yours.


485
00:32:07.287 --> 00:32:10.280
Now, please,
nobody send in more than four bits


486
00:32:10.373 --> 00:32:12.865
<i>because you may not be able
to spare it yourself.</i>


487
00:32:13.543 --> 00:32:15.876
<i>Miss Cooley, maybe you think you just...</i>

488
00:32:15.962 --> 00:32:18.750
Every pot over $10,
let's cut a half for that house of hers.


489
00:32:18.840 --> 00:32:22.504
<i>And they gonna be a-looking out for you.
Ain't you, folks?</i>


490
00:32:26.431 --> 00:32:28.297
Yeah. Come in, door's open.

491
00:32:28.391 --> 00:32:30.508
Lonesome, you should see
how the money's pouring in!


492
00:32:30.602 --> 00:32:31.704
They need five girls to count it.

493
00:32:31.728 --> 00:32:33.720
Young man,
you've graduated from sustaining.


494
00:32:33.813 --> 00:32:35.054
You've got a client.

495
00:32:35.148 --> 00:32:37.585
- What in the ever-loving world is that?
- It's a mattress company.


496
00:32:37.609 --> 00:32:41.819
- That means you get your 1,000 a week.
- Get his shirt. Stand still, you slob.


497
00:32:41.905 --> 00:32:43.897
- Here. Get your hand in here.
- There you go.


498
00:32:44.407 --> 00:32:45.818
Yeah, yonder she comes.

499
00:32:46.368 --> 00:32:47.368
Mmm!

500
00:32:54.334 --> 00:32:57.498
Sure is prettier music
than a cigar-box guitar.


501
00:32:57.587 --> 00:33:04.175
There's 18,541 of these things so far,

502
00:33:04.261 --> 00:33:05.797
and we ain't hardly started yet.

503
00:33:06.889 --> 00:33:10.177
Miss Cooley says thank you.
You're good people.


504
00:33:11.184 --> 00:33:13.267
You folks are building a house.

505
00:33:13.353 --> 00:33:15.390
Ain't nothing in this world you can't do

506
00:33:15.480 --> 00:33:17.642
when you let the best side of you
take over.


507
00:33:19.442 --> 00:33:22.025
Oh, I see my old clock-watcher
going this a-way.


508
00:33:22.737 --> 00:33:25.150
He wants me to make sure
I leave time for the commercial.


509
00:33:25.907 --> 00:33:27.547
You didn't know I
had a sponsor, did you?

510
00:33:28.243 --> 00:33:30.280
Neither did I till they woke me up
this morning.


511
00:33:32.163 --> 00:33:33.950
He's a good-looking scoundrel, ain't he?

512
00:33:34.040 --> 00:33:35.497
Hmm.

513
00:33:36.293 --> 00:33:41.755
Heh! What? Yeah, I got the commercial
on me somewhere. Let's see, yeah.


514
00:33:43.550 --> 00:33:48.386
See, it's... "Johnny Longshot's tip
for the daily double."


515
00:33:48.972 --> 00:33:51.965
No, no, that ain't it. Let's see.

516
00:33:54.811 --> 00:34:00.273
"Lonesome, darling, you ain't forgetting
your little Arkansas Annie?"


517
00:34:00.358 --> 00:34:02.975
No, that surely ain't it.

518
00:34:07.115 --> 00:34:08.401
This is it, this is it.

519
00:34:09.618 --> 00:34:14.738
"Friends, comma, why not invest
in sleep insurance, question mark?


520
00:34:14.831 --> 00:34:17.039
That is what you will be doing

521
00:34:17.125 --> 00:34:21.335
when you buy your Luffler
Easy Rest Mattress, period.


522
00:34:21.421 --> 00:34:24.539
<i>Comes in six tasty flavors..."</i>

523
00:34:24.633 --> 00:34:27.341
- Isn't he wonderful?
<i>- That's our next commercial.</i>


524
00:34:30.847 --> 00:34:33.885
<i>Personally, when I'm dog-tired,
I can sleep on the floor.</i>


525
00:34:33.975 --> 00:34:36.968
One of the best night's sleep I ever had
was in a boxcar.


526
00:34:38.188 --> 00:34:42.182
They say that a firm mattress
is better for your spine.


527
00:34:42.275 --> 00:34:44.187
But if you're gonna follow that
all the way,


528
00:34:44.277 --> 00:34:46.519
ain't it better to just go ahead
and sleep on the floor?


529
00:34:46.613 --> 00:34:48.024
Hmm.

530
00:34:48.907 --> 00:34:51.695
But if some of you softies
insist on sleeping on a bed,


531
00:34:51.785 --> 00:34:54.243
I reckon you can do worse
than a Luffler Easy Rest.


532
00:34:55.205 --> 00:34:56.321
End of commercial.

533
00:34:57.375 --> 00:34:59.707
Maybe also the end of Lonesome Rhodes.

534
00:35:03.880 --> 00:35:06.953
Seriously, I was on the phone
with Mr. Luffler for half an hour.


535
00:35:07.550 --> 00:35:10.418
I'm sure he's seen us,
and he hasn't even looked around.


536
00:35:10.512 --> 00:35:13.425
He says he's got a loophole
in his contract,


537
00:35:13.515 --> 00:35:16.633
and if you kid his commercial once more,
he's going to walk right through it.


538
00:35:21.856 --> 00:35:23.313
- Hey, hiya, Lonesome.
- Hi.


539
00:35:23.400 --> 00:35:26.984
Oh, hey, hey. Boy, 
I almost forgot. Ha ha!

540
00:35:27.070 --> 00:35:29.278
I got you a month's food ticket
at the White Owl


541
00:35:29.364 --> 00:35:31.258
- for the plug you gave them this morning.
- Yeah?


542
00:35:31.282 --> 00:35:34.491
Yeah. Guess you didn't know I do
a little "schlock-meistering" on the side.


543
00:35:34.577 --> 00:35:35.943
Schlock-meistering?

544
00:35:36.037 --> 00:35:38.745
You slip in a remark, innocent-like,
about one of these products,


545
00:35:38.832 --> 00:35:40.073
and they pay off in kind.

546
00:35:40.166 --> 00:35:43.830
A case of beer, free drinks
at the Yellow Rose Café, all that jazz.


547
00:35:43.920 --> 00:35:45.661
I tell you, boy, it mounts up.

548
00:35:45.755 --> 00:35:48.919
Isn't that illegal,
stealing time from regular sponsors?


549
00:35:49.008 --> 00:35:53.048
Illegal? Honey, nothing's illegal
if they don't catch you.


550
00:35:54.806 --> 00:35:57.093
- See you around, Joey.
- Okay, Lonesome, see you around.


551
00:35:57.183 --> 00:35:59.971
- Who was that?
- Joey DePalma, Luffler's office boy.


552
00:36:00.061 --> 00:36:01.552
He won't be an office boy long.

553
00:36:04.107 --> 00:36:07.851
Mr. Luffler told me he don't like me
to talk nasty about his mattress.


554
00:36:07.944 --> 00:36:11.233
Shucks, I said you could get
a good night's sleep on one of them.


555
00:36:12.282 --> 00:36:13.773
If you was real tired.

556
00:36:17.370 --> 00:36:18.486
There I go again.

557
00:36:19.247 --> 00:36:23.708
But I just can't get my mouth around
some of them things they wanted me to say.


558
00:36:25.128 --> 00:36:26.619
Well, I'll try.

559
00:36:33.052 --> 00:36:35.544
"And now a message of importance."

560
00:36:39.893 --> 00:36:43.557
Now, you good people ain't so dumb
you don't know what's important.


561
00:36:43.646 --> 00:36:46.810
Atom bomb's important,
and things like that.


562
00:36:47.400 --> 00:36:49.892
I don't reckon a Luffler mattress
will break your back,


563
00:36:49.986 --> 00:36:52.854
but it sure ain't
no world-shaking message.


564
00:36:56.034 --> 00:36:58.242
Just in case you
won't be seeing me again...


565
00:36:58.328 --> 00:36:59.569
Hey, fellas, come on.

566
00:37:00.205 --> 00:37:02.322
Here's a little song to remember me by.

567
00:37:08.254 --> 00:37:09.254
Give me a "E."

568
00:37:10.299 --> 00:37:14.212

Yeah?

578
00:38:08.022 --> 00:38:09.513
Who? Who is it?

579
00:38:10.149 --> 00:38:12.562
It's me, Lonesome. Larry.

580
00:38:13.194 --> 00:38:14.560
Thought I'd say good-bye.

581
00:38:16.656 --> 00:38:17.988
Just a minute.

582
00:38:19.659 --> 00:38:21.901
Just thought I'd tell you
I'm gonna hit the road.


583
00:38:21.995 --> 00:38:24.453
- Where to?
- Oh, what's the difference?


584
00:38:25.206 --> 00:38:26.663
For Mr. Luffler.

585
00:38:26.749 --> 00:38:31.039
He wants to fire me unless I promise
to show him my scripts in advance.


586
00:38:31.129 --> 00:38:33.587
There ain't no scripts.
It's just me.


587
00:38:34.340 --> 00:38:36.423
- It was me.
- Larry, stay, even on sustaining.


588
00:38:36.509 --> 00:38:38.171
- Nah.
- What you did for Miss Cooley...


589
00:38:38.261 --> 00:38:41.379
- No, I'm not my brother's keeper.
- You are, and you don't know it.


590
00:38:41.472 --> 00:38:43.930
No, I don't kowtow to no mattress company.

591
00:38:45.560 --> 00:38:47.267
See you in jail sometime.

592
00:38:52.609 --> 00:38:53.609
Well...

593
00:38:54.444 --> 00:38:56.106
we shook them up a little bit.

594
00:38:56.946 --> 00:38:59.188
- Got a ride for our money.
- Larry.


595
00:39:02.452 --> 00:39:03.943
You come here.

596
00:39:29.312 --> 00:39:32.601
Did I call you a cold fish, Marcia?

597
00:39:35.026 --> 00:39:36.187
Marcia.

598
00:39:39.072 --> 00:39:41.029
It's short for "marshmallow."

599
00:39:43.159 --> 00:39:45.276
My marshmallow.

600
00:39:49.707 --> 00:39:51.198
This way, please.

601
00:40:03.930 --> 00:40:08.766
Move it along.
Come on, move it, move it, move it.


602
00:40:13.064 --> 00:40:14.771
Joey, the boss wants you.

603
00:40:19.487 --> 00:40:20.728
That's terrible.

604
00:40:24.575 --> 00:40:26.737
- Mr. Luffler...
- No more phone calls.


605
00:40:26.828 --> 00:40:29.348
From the day that you hired Rhodes,
up to and including yesterday,


606
00:40:29.372 --> 00:40:32.331
- our sales have increased 55 percent.
- I smell smoke.


607
00:40:36.462 --> 00:40:39.455
Mr. Luffler, I know he's hurt
your feelings, but as a merchandise man,


608
00:40:39.549 --> 00:40:43.839
I must say that a 55-percent jump in sales
is quite a painkiller.


609
00:40:43.928 --> 00:40:45.906
- I'll think it over.
- You called for me, Mr. Luffler?


610
00:40:45.930 --> 00:40:48.547
Yes. I can always get him back.

611
00:40:49.267 --> 00:40:51.850
- They're for the credit department.
- Oh, yes, sir.


612
00:40:53.021 --> 00:40:56.640
Joey. You're a smart lad.

613
00:40:57.400 --> 00:40:59.892
Do you think I
acted hasty in the firing?

614
00:40:59.986 --> 00:41:02.524
If it were my product,
I wouldn't let anybody ridicule it.


615
00:41:02.613 --> 00:41:05.071
- Now what?
- Your wife on one.


616
00:41:05.950 --> 00:41:07.157
Yes, dear?

617
00:41:08.411 --> 00:41:10.573
Would you mind your own business, dear?

618
00:41:10.663 --> 00:41:13.906
And would you tell the ladies' garden club
to mind its own business.


619
00:41:14.584 --> 00:41:15.916
Credit department.

620
00:41:16.002 --> 00:41:18.564
Get me Browning, Schlagel and McNally
in New York City right away.


621
00:41:18.588 --> 00:41:19.874
Don't worry, it's kosher.

622
00:41:19.964 --> 00:41:22.707
- Mr. Luffler gave me a message for them.
- Know the number?


623
00:41:22.800 --> 00:41:24.680
It's the biggest advertising agency
in New York.


624
00:41:24.761 --> 00:41:26.718
Browning, Schlagel and McNally.

625
00:41:26.804 --> 00:41:28.045
Now, try Information, huh?

626
00:41:29.307 --> 00:41:32.516
Browning, Schlagel and McNally.
Long-distance from Memphis?


627
00:41:32.602 --> 00:41:36.346
Just a moment.
A Mr. Joseph DePalma from Memphis.


628
00:41:36.439 --> 00:41:38.647
He represents Lonesome Rhodes.

629
00:41:39.734 --> 00:41:41.726
What a crazy business we're in.

630
00:41:41.819 --> 00:41:44.527
This is about some joker
called Lonesome Rhodes


631
00:41:44.614 --> 00:41:46.822
on a local Memphis sta...

632
00:41:46.908 --> 00:41:50.902
Hey. He topped both CBS
and NBC down there.


633
00:41:52.121 --> 00:41:54.488
Hello? Mr. DePalma?

634
00:41:55.041 --> 00:41:57.579
Yeah, hello, I just thought
I ought to let you know


635
00:41:57.668 --> 00:42:01.503
that Lonesome Rhodes
is being flooded with offers. Yeah.


636
00:42:02.298 --> 00:42:05.632
Yeah, if you happen to be interested,

637
00:42:06.260 --> 00:42:09.378
Uh-huh. Right. 
I'll call you back at 5:00.

638
00:42:09.472 --> 00:42:10.838
Fine.

639
00:42:10.932 --> 00:42:14.972
- Well, pleasure, baby.
- I caught that show on my vacation.


640
00:42:15.061 --> 00:42:16.973
He's a living doll.

641
00:42:17.647 --> 00:42:19.058
Well, could be.

642
00:42:19.148 --> 00:42:20.935
E.B.D. and O. in New York City.

643
00:42:31.787 --> 00:42:32.947
Marcia.

644
00:42:35.748 --> 00:42:36.829
Marcia?

645
00:42:40.169 --> 00:42:42.752
Marcia, you told me to pick you up
in time for the show.


646
00:43:00.148 --> 00:43:03.266
- Oh, hey, have you seen Lonesome?
- You may find him in there.


647
00:43:03.359 --> 00:43:04.645
Where? Here?

648
00:43:06.988 --> 00:43:09.776
- Oh, you mean in here?
- Wait a minute, sir.


649
00:43:09.866 --> 00:43:12.483
- I wouldn't barge in there if I were you.
- I'm not you.


650
00:43:12.577 --> 00:43:15.945
Hey, hey, Lonesome. Lonesome boy. Hey.

651
00:43:16.038 --> 00:43:17.449
Yeah, yeah, who is it?

652
00:43:17.540 --> 00:43:20.829
It's destiny, that's who it is.
It's your destiny.


653
00:43:20.918 --> 00:43:22.284
- Who is it?
- Hi.


654
00:43:22.378 --> 00:43:25.212
- What? What?
- Honey child, I sold your show.


655
00:43:26.382 --> 00:43:28.123
- To who?
- To the big time.


656
00:43:29.927 --> 00:43:32.322
You ever hear of Browning, Schlagel
and McNally? No, you wouldn't know.


657
00:43:32.346 --> 00:43:33.803
The advertising company.

658
00:43:33.890 --> 00:43:37.224
Boy, I got them bidding
against the Cutner Agency, MCA...


659
00:43:37.310 --> 00:43:39.347
- MC who?
- And a dozen others you wouldn't know.


660
00:43:39.437 --> 00:43:42.805
Look, BS and M wants you
for <i>The Vida Jakes Hour.</i>


661
00:43:42.899 --> 00:43:47.109
Eight o'clock, coast-to-coast. I told them
we'd let them know at 1700 hours.


662
00:43:47.195 --> 00:43:50.154
- Boy, I tell you, we're on to New York.
- We are?


663
00:43:50.239 --> 00:43:51.901
They asked if you
had a New York agent.

664
00:43:51.991 --> 00:43:53.948
Would you like to meet
your New York agent?


665
00:43:55.286 --> 00:44:00.498
A bum out of jail in Pickett, Arkansas,
and a Memphis office boy! Hey.

Thank you. Oh, thank you.

674
00:44:19.560 --> 00:44:23.930
Now, in the last quarter, gentlemen,
and Miss Valerie,


675
00:44:24.690 --> 00:44:28.559
we have spent over $300,000
of General Haynesworth's money


676
00:44:29.320 --> 00:44:31.937
to make this country Vitajex-conscious.

677
00:44:32.031 --> 00:44:35.365
And all we've succeeded in doing—
next chart, please...


678
00:44:35.826 --> 00:44:39.069
is dropping from ten percent
of the market to seven.


679
00:44:39.163 --> 00:44:40.370
Now, I...

680
00:44:40.456 --> 00:44:42.994
Mr. Macey,
I'm late for the dog-food meeting now.


681
00:44:43.084 --> 00:44:46.293
- Can I say my say and go?
- Yes, Doctor.


682
00:44:46.379 --> 00:44:47.379
Miss.

683
00:44:48.130 --> 00:44:52.170
Now, I've gone over this product
pretty carefully in the lab.


684
00:44:52.260 --> 00:44:56.675
Vitajex has a few grains of aspirin.

685
00:44:56.764 --> 00:44:59.507
A little sugar
that might give you some energy.


686
00:44:59.600 --> 00:45:05.096
But, well, frankly, general or no general,
we have nothing to sell.


687
00:45:05.189 --> 00:45:07.806
Will you strike that from the transcript,
Miss Murray?


688
00:45:08.985 --> 00:45:13.070
You know that General Haynesworth
always reads the product group reports.


689
00:45:13.155 --> 00:45:16.148
I can't help it.
I was hired as a research chemist.


690
00:45:16.242 --> 00:45:19.360
Dr. Wylie, there's nothing wrong
with Vitajex, is there?


691
00:45:19.453 --> 00:45:21.695
It won't kill you,
if that's what you mean.


692
00:45:22.749 --> 00:45:25.602
I'd say it's relatively harmless,
like a lot of the old patent medicines.


693
00:45:25.626 --> 00:45:28.710
Thank you, Doctor. Now let's get
this train back on the tracks.


694
00:45:28.796 --> 00:45:29.796
Miss Mills.

695
00:45:29.798 --> 00:45:34.258
With all due respect
to our estimable television department.


696
00:45:35.636 --> 00:45:37.172
He hates our guts.

697
00:45:37.263 --> 00:45:42.509
And its sudden enthusiasm
for, uh, Lonesome Rhodes.


698
00:45:43.060 --> 00:45:46.303
I think we need a dignified sell.

699
00:45:46.981 --> 00:45:50.895
I'd like to see a 15-minute participation
on the Ed Murrow show.


700
00:45:53.154 --> 00:45:54.736
Mr. Rhodes is here, sir.

701
00:45:55.573 --> 00:46:01.319
Jim boy, don't you think it?
Well, I mean, it's irregular.


702
00:46:01.412 --> 00:46:04.996
Well, I just thought if you and the boys
got a look at him, Mace,


703
00:46:05.082 --> 00:46:07.165
you'd see why the TV
shop is sold on him.

704
00:46:07.877 --> 00:46:11.541
- Gentlemen, Lonesome Rhodes.
- Hiya, folks.


705
00:46:13.090 --> 00:46:14.090
Howdy.

706
00:46:14.800 --> 00:46:18.339
I come to help you sell these little
kidney pills, whatever the heck they are.


707
00:46:29.815 --> 00:46:33.525
Hey, what's the matter?
Ain't you got no spittoons around here?


708
00:46:34.737 --> 00:46:38.526
Denise,
would you bring the gentleman a spittoon?


709
00:46:40.534 --> 00:46:43.277
Now, what's your particular problem,
Mr. Fuzzy-Lip?


710
00:46:43.788 --> 00:46:48.158
Sit down, Mr. Rhodes. You may as well know
Vitajex is the sixth sister


711
00:46:48.250 --> 00:46:49.957
in the international drug family.

712
00:46:50.044 --> 00:46:52.773
They're even getting ready
to put out a smaller pill and to cut the...


713
00:46:52.797 --> 00:46:56.256
Jim boy,
before we make any hasty decisions,


714
00:46:56.342 --> 00:46:57.799
- I'd recommend—
- Shh, shh!


715
00:46:59.428 --> 00:47:03.012
Look at these poor little white pills
you're trying to peddle.


716
00:47:04.183 --> 00:47:07.597
Look kind of pale.
There's no charge to thenา.


717
00:47:09.271 --> 00:47:12.230
Hey, I got an idea.
Let's make them yellow.


718
00:47:12.817 --> 00:47:15.025
Yellow's the color of sunshine and energy.

719
00:47:15.111 --> 00:47:18.445
Gives a fella that get-up-and-go
that sets him up solid with the ladies.


720
00:47:18.531 --> 00:47:20.898
You get the idea? Like this:

721
00:47:20.991 --> 00:47:24.701
"If you wanna be bright-eyed
and bushy-tailed,


722
00:47:24.787 --> 00:47:28.406
why, just gobble up a handful of Vitajex,
and your battery's charged."


723
00:47:28.499 --> 00:47:29.499
Watch.

724
00:47:38.092 --> 00:47:42.587
Ahh! Ha ha!

725
00:47:42.680 --> 00:47:46.139
Whoo-wee! I am ready!

726
00:47:46.225 --> 00:47:49.969
I mean, I'm in the mood!

727
00:47:50.062 --> 00:47:54.602
My personality undergoes
a startling change.


728
00:47:54.692 --> 00:47:55.808
I have a spittoon...

729
00:48:00.281 --> 00:48:05.777
Oh, I'm gonna get you,
you little redheaded filly, you.


730
00:48:08.038 --> 00:48:11.952
That's what Vitajex does to me,
and I ain't even swallowed them yet.


731
00:48:13.544 --> 00:48:17.037
And you college geniuses
want dignity on your progranา.


732
00:48:17.131 --> 00:48:19.498
Back where I come from,
if a fella looks too dignified,


733
00:48:19.592 --> 00:48:21.754
we figure he's looking
to steal your watch.


734
00:48:21.844 --> 00:48:24.052
I'll move your merchandise.

735
00:48:25.890 --> 00:48:29.383
Shh, shh, shh. Peace.

This is General Haynesworth.

767
00:50:32.266 --> 00:50:35.350
I've just seen Lonesome what's-his-name
on the television,


768
00:50:35.436 --> 00:50:36.552
and I like him.

769
00:50:38.522 --> 00:50:44.189
Why don't you take Vitajex
like Lonesome Rhodes does.


770
00:50:45.029 --> 00:50:48.989
She's talking about
the new large economy size.


771
00:50:52.911 --> 00:50:56.450
I bought my boyfriend a ten-year supply.

772
00:50:57.958 --> 00:51:01.247
- And now, the soft sell.
- Oomph.


773
00:51:01.337 --> 00:51:03.124
Keep your eye on the rating.

774
00:51:03.213 --> 00:51:07.082
- Vitajex, Vitajex, Vitajex.
- Vitajex, what you're doing to me.


775
00:51:07.176 --> 00:51:10.465
- Now, the hard sell.
- Vitajex, Vitajex.


776
00:51:12.598 --> 00:51:14.339
Vitajex, 39.8.

777
00:51:24.526 --> 00:51:26.609
General,
I-I'm willing to put myself on record.


778
00:51:27.237 --> 00:51:30.355
I say he's a risk.
Uncooperative and unpredictable.


779
00:51:30.908 --> 00:51:32.774
Why, we've spent
tens of thousands of dollars


780
00:51:32.868 --> 00:51:36.452
to find out the key words
like "bracing" and "zestful."


781
00:51:37.122 --> 00:51:40.741
Rhodes has the audacity to tear our copy
to shreds right in front of the audience.


782
00:51:40.834 --> 00:51:42.746
Thirty-nine-point-eight.

783
00:51:43.253 --> 00:51:44.733
Hey, General, where the heck are you?

784
00:51:44.797 --> 00:51:48.290
General, if you'll forgive us,
we have to get back to town.


785
00:51:48.384 --> 00:51:50.967
Why, hello, girls.

786
00:51:51.053 --> 00:51:54.091
How's Princeton '28
and old eight for the stump?


787
00:51:59.478 --> 00:52:01.845
Afraid I make these Madison Avenue fellas
kind of unhappy.


788
00:52:01.939 --> 00:52:04.352
I'm not in the business
to make those fellows happy.


789
00:52:04.441 --> 00:52:07.855
I'm in the business of putting the public
in a frame of mind to buy Vitajex.


790
00:52:07.945 --> 00:52:10.028
- Exactly.
- Excuse us, dear.


791
00:52:10.114 --> 00:52:11.525
- Of course.
- Poor old Mace.


792
00:52:11.615 --> 00:52:15.108
He's already had one heart attack.
You're winding him up to another one.


793
00:52:15.202 --> 00:52:17.910
- Well, General, that's his hard luck.
- Hello, Senator.


794
00:52:17.996 --> 00:52:21.740
- Did you have a fine flight?
- Splendid, splendid.


795
00:52:21.834 --> 00:52:24.167
I'll join you
when I get freshened up a bit.


796
00:52:24.253 --> 00:52:25.869
That's my houseguest, 
Senator Fuller.

797
00:52:25.963 --> 00:52:28.244
That's the sort of man I'd like to see
in the White House.


798
00:52:28.298 --> 00:52:30.193
Don't they call him
the last of the isolationists?


799
00:52:30.217 --> 00:52:33.085
Oh, maybe in some of those left-wing
New York papers.


800
00:52:33.178 --> 00:52:35.966
Rhodes, I want you
to get to know people like that.


801
00:52:36.056 --> 00:52:39.220
I'd like to sort of take you under my wing
and educate you.


802
00:52:39.309 --> 00:52:42.768
Heh. Shucks, General,
I'm just a country boy.


803
00:52:42.855 --> 00:52:45.472
Young man, never forget Will Rogers.

804
00:52:45.566 --> 00:52:48.980
He was just a gum-chewing,
rope-twirling cowboy.


805
00:52:49.069 --> 00:52:52.358
But he got to where he was
telling off presidents and kings.


806
00:52:52.948 --> 00:52:56.032
General, my thinking is the second section
of the same train.


807
00:52:57.161 --> 00:53:00.074
I've always gone in
for long-range planning.


808
00:53:00.164 --> 00:53:04.124
Right now, Lonesome is merely popular.
Oh, very popular.


809
00:53:04.209 --> 00:53:09.170
But Lonesome Rhodes could be made
into an influence, a wielder of opinion.


810
00:53:09.256 --> 00:53:12.715
An institution positively sacred
to this country,


811
00:53:12.801 --> 00:53:14.667
like the Washington Monument.

812
00:53:14.762 --> 00:53:18.176
I suspect your idealistic young lady
disagrees with me.


813
00:53:18.265 --> 00:53:21.224
But my study of history has convinced me

814
00:53:21.310 --> 00:53:24.769
that in every strong and healthy society
from the Egyptians on,


815
00:53:24.855 --> 00:53:28.064
the mass had to be guided
with a strong hand


816
00:53:28.150 --> 00:53:29.857
by a responsible elite.

817
00:53:29.943 --> 00:53:34.233
Let us not forget that in TV
we have the greatest instrument


818
00:53:34.323 --> 00:53:37.191
for mass persuasion
in the history of the world.


819
00:53:37.284 --> 00:53:38.845
General,
I don't mean to flatter you, sir...


820
00:53:38.869 --> 00:53:41.953
What? Oh, yes.
Let's have a go at it, shall we?


821
00:53:42.039 --> 00:53:44.326
Roger. Roger!

822
00:53:45.709 --> 00:53:47.496
Are you jotting this down?

823
00:53:48.587 --> 00:53:53.457
First, I'll see if I can sell him
on the idea of a <i>Life</i> cover.


824
00:53:53.550 --> 00:53:55.507
Remind me to call him for lunch.

825
00:54:10.317 --> 00:54:15.233
I proudly dedicate to you
the latest hybrid iris


826
00:54:15.322 --> 00:54:17.905
of our horticultural laboratory,

827
00:54:17.991 --> 00:54:20.984
the <i>unusfloratorum.</i>

828
00:54:21.078 --> 00:54:26.790
We girls call it the Lonesome Rhodes iris.

829
00:54:26.875 --> 00:54:30.915
I christen thee the USS <i>Rhodes.</i>

830
00:54:37.261 --> 00:54:40.470
And so, in behalf
of our great commonwealth,


831
00:54:40.556 --> 00:54:44.015
I'm proud to dedicate
one of nature's wonders,


832
00:54:44.101 --> 00:54:48.971
henceforth and forever
to be known as Mount Rhodes.


833
00:54:53.902 --> 00:54:58.237
And now, Lonesome,
back in those difficult days,


834
00:54:58.907 --> 00:55:00.773
you had a pal.

835
00:55:01.869 --> 00:55:03.906
We flew him to New York tonight

836
00:55:03.996 --> 00:55:08.286
to help recall the struggle and joys
of times gone by.


837
00:55:08.959 --> 00:55:12.418
Because, Lonesome Rhodes, you lived it.

838
00:55:15.465 --> 00:55:18.549
Hey, Lonesome! Ha ha!

839
00:55:18.635 --> 00:55:20.342
Beanie!

840
00:55:22.347 --> 00:55:24.259
Good to see you.

841
00:55:24.349 --> 00:55:27.683
You ugly scoundrel.
Where you been anyhow, huh?


842
00:55:27.769 --> 00:55:30.056
We gotta go out and get you
some good-looking clothes.


843
00:55:30.147 --> 00:55:32.434
You've been looking ugly
about as long as I can stand.


844
00:55:33.400 --> 00:55:36.814
White Plains, New York.
Thank you, thank you.


845
00:55:38.030 --> 00:55:40.568
Yeah. Hey, listen to this, listen to this.

846
00:55:40.657 --> 00:55:44.071
"Dear Lonesome, the boys in our ward
at the veterans' hospital


847
00:55:44.161 --> 00:55:47.905
just got together and donated $9.75."

848
00:55:47.998 --> 00:55:51.287
You ask me how I can keep going 17 hours
without sleep?


849
00:55:51.376 --> 00:55:53.584
Man, this is better than sleep.

850
00:55:53.670 --> 00:55:56.253
Didn't I tell you, kid? 
Didn't I tell you?

851
00:55:56.340 --> 00:55:58.081
Do you still want
me to hold this sign?

852
00:55:59.885 --> 00:56:04.596
As general manager of the Sherry Towers,
it's my honor to present you a gold key


853
00:56:04.681 --> 00:56:07.970
to the two top floors
of New York's finest hotel.


854
00:56:10.520 --> 00:56:14.230
- To the very top, boy.
- Yeah, you can't go much higher than that.


855
00:56:24.117 --> 00:56:25.153
Oh.

856
00:56:28.497 --> 00:56:30.830
Hello? Oh, Larry.

857
00:56:31.667 --> 00:56:33.249
Oh, what? What time is it?

858
00:56:35.295 --> 00:56:37.127
Marcia, you gotta come over.

859
00:56:37.673 --> 00:56:39.630
I never should've let Joey
sell me on the idea


860
00:56:39.716 --> 00:56:41.799
of living in a penthouse over the offices.

861
00:56:41.885 --> 00:56:43.968
Twenty-five rooms to be alone in.

862
00:56:44.054 --> 00:56:47.764
I feel like a shipwrecked fella
on an island.


863
00:56:47.849 --> 00:56:49.681
Oh, Larry, I know that island.

864
00:56:49.768 --> 00:56:52.351
It's populated by a tribe
of friendly girls.


865
00:56:52.437 --> 00:56:56.306
Marcia, honey, do you believe me when
I say it's a matter of life and death?


866
00:56:58.944 --> 00:57:00.480
Call me soon, doll.

867
00:57:02.614 --> 00:57:04.230
Huh? Larry?

868
00:57:04.825 --> 00:57:07.613
If you don't come,
I'll dive off this balcony into the park,


869
00:57:07.703 --> 00:57:09.490
and I'm ten blocks from the lake.

870
00:57:17.212 --> 00:57:19.499
Marcia, come out here a minute.

871
00:57:31.852 --> 00:57:33.764
I had a girl up here tonight.

872
00:57:35.897 --> 00:57:37.104
I get restless.

873
00:57:38.025 --> 00:57:42.611
Well, I lied to you, but when it's over,
I'm more lonely than I was before.


874
00:57:45.407 --> 00:57:47.007
Marcia, will you come out here a minute?

875
00:57:51.288 --> 00:57:54.747
Look at all them TV aerials sticking up
like branches down there.


876
00:57:55.333 --> 00:57:59.077
There's a whole forest of them
from here to San Diego.


877
00:58:00.380 --> 00:58:02.918
All of them waiting to hear
what I got to say.


878
00:58:03.008 --> 00:58:06.046
Is that what you woke me up
in the middle of the night for?


879
00:58:06.636 --> 00:58:08.753
Marcia, what I'm trying to say is,

880
00:58:08.847 --> 00:58:11.180
all of them millions of people
believing in me,


881
00:58:11.725 --> 00:58:13.182
doing what I tell them to,

882
00:58:14.853 --> 00:58:15.853
scares me.

883
00:58:16.605 --> 00:58:20.519
Honest. General and all them big shots
trying to educate me.


884
00:58:21.068 --> 00:58:22.684
Educate you or use you?

885
00:58:23.111 --> 00:58:26.479
That's it, see?
The general says our country needs me.


886
00:58:26.573 --> 00:58:28.360
I'm supposed to be an influence.

887
00:58:32.120 --> 00:58:34.328
That's mighty tall grass, Marcia.

888
00:58:38.835 --> 00:58:41.122
We're getting in deep, Marcia.

889
00:58:42.422 --> 00:58:46.211
A thousand times deeper than we dreamed
when we were starting out in Arkansas.


890
00:58:49.137 --> 00:58:51.094
I know on the
set I'm beginning to act

891
00:58:51.181 --> 00:58:54.015
like I just ate the western hemisphere
for breakfast.


892
00:58:55.477 --> 00:58:58.436
Then, down here in the boiler room,
I know I need advice.


893
00:58:59.523 --> 00:59:02.937
Not the kind I get from Joey
or the Madison Avenue high-domes


894
00:59:03.026 --> 00:59:06.645
who say <i>"gesundheit"</i>
before I even pucker up to sneeze.


895
00:59:07.489 --> 00:59:11.358
No. And now, when I'm coming
to the top of the mountain,


896
00:59:12.577 --> 00:59:16.321
I need you, because you level with me.

897
00:59:17.666 --> 00:59:20.204
You're my lifeline to truth, and...

898
00:59:22.546 --> 00:59:23.546
well...

899
00:59:25.882 --> 00:59:27.339
marry me, Marcia.

900
00:59:28.385 --> 00:59:29.385
Will you?

901
00:59:30.428 --> 00:59:32.545
That's what I called you over here for.

902
00:59:49.865 --> 00:59:51.902
Can't keep anything alive up here.

903
00:59:53.326 --> 00:59:55.318
Dust in this city kills everything.

904
01:00:02.210 --> 01:00:03.210
Larry.

905
01:00:10.677 --> 01:00:11.793
Don't play with me.

906
01:00:13.847 --> 01:00:15.054
Don't hurt me.

907
01:00:21.897 --> 01:00:22.978

Marcia, there's a lady to see you.

912
01:00:42.792 --> 01:00:45.956
- A lady?
- I guess so, she's got a dress on.


913
01:00:46.046 --> 01:00:48.208
I don't wanna see anybody up here.

914
01:00:48.298 --> 01:00:50.790
Okay, I'll tell her to pick it up
and move it out.


915
01:00:53.303 --> 01:00:55.670
- I'm sorry, ma'am—
- I... I... I...

01:00:55.764 --> 01:00:58.427
I... I... Ahh.

<i>You know,

918

Are you the...

919
01:01:05.732 --> 01:01:07.849
I am Mrs. Rhodes.

920
01:01:11.154 --> 01:01:13.897
You related to Mr. Rhodes?

921
01:01:14.616 --> 01:01:15.857
Mm-hmm.

922
01:01:18.203 --> 01:01:20.069
But you're not his mother.

923
01:01:22.374 --> 01:01:23.706
His wife.

924
01:01:27.295 --> 01:01:28.411
All right, Beanie.

925
01:01:29.047 --> 01:01:31.664
<i>You know, the other day,
I was talking about divorce...</i>


926
01:01:35.428 --> 01:01:38.387
Ohh. Isn't he something?

927
01:01:38.932 --> 01:01:41.595
You mind if I
mute this brass a little?

928
01:01:47.774 --> 01:01:48.774
So...

929
01:01:51.695 --> 01:01:54.062
you're Lonesome's new tootsie, huh?

930
01:01:56.491 --> 01:01:58.904
Lonesome. That's a hot one.

931
01:01:59.744 --> 01:02:03.488
I hope you have better luck
keeping him lonesome than I did.


932
01:02:04.541 --> 01:02:08.785
I think you should understand I'm just
a business associate of Mr. Rhodes.


933
01:02:08.878 --> 01:02:11.712
Ain't you the whole box top, though?

934
01:02:12.382 --> 01:02:17.218
The floor manager of your program
is my brother-in-law's first cousin.


935
01:02:17.304 --> 01:02:19.546
He told me where I could find you.

936
01:02:20.056 --> 01:02:23.515
So you come off it, little lady.

937
01:02:24.352 --> 01:02:25.843
You mind if I do?

938
01:02:26.855 --> 01:02:28.062
I'm through with it.

939
01:02:32.861 --> 01:02:35.979
I must say, Mr. Rhodes might have done me
the courtesy of telling me himself.


940
01:02:36.072 --> 01:02:40.282
Oh, Mr. Rhodes don't do
no courtesies to nobody.


941
01:02:40.368 --> 01:02:42.610
I could write a book about him.

942
01:02:43.538 --> 01:02:46.531
Is that the purpose of your visit,
to collect some more material?


943
01:02:46.624 --> 01:02:49.116
Oh, I came to collect,

944
01:02:49.753 --> 01:02:51.415
but it ain't material.

945
01:02:52.380 --> 01:02:55.873
Unless you get Larry to pay me
three grand a month,


946
01:02:55.967 --> 01:02:58.835
not only will I not divorce him,

947
01:02:58.928 --> 01:03:02.012
but I will make it plenty hot
for the both of you.


948
01:03:03.600 --> 01:03:08.061
I already got some feelers
from <i>Confidential</i> magazine.


949
01:03:12.692 --> 01:03:15.230
I'm not engaged to your husband.

950
01:03:15.320 --> 01:03:16.401
Ah.

951
01:03:17.155 --> 01:03:21.149
Larry, he thinks he has to take a bite
out of every broad he comes across.


952
01:03:22.202 --> 01:03:24.945
Then he calls them a tramp,
and he drops them, and...


953
01:03:25.538 --> 01:03:29.327
All sort of psycho-something-or-other,
you know?


954
01:03:30.335 --> 01:03:33.578
I caught him red-handed
with my best girlfriend.


955
01:03:34.130 --> 01:03:35.462
He broke my jaw.

956
01:03:36.216 --> 01:03:38.708
Seems to be working quite effectively now.

957
01:03:38.802 --> 01:03:39.802
Mm-hmm.

958
01:03:40.512 --> 01:03:44.381
Mrs. Rhodes, if you'll excuse me,
I'm very busy this morning.


959
01:03:47.894 --> 01:03:52.309
Well, tell Larry, three-G a month,
then he's yours.


960

we wanted to show you this.

Lonesome Rhodes designed it himself.

Mechanical laughter, mechanical applause?
What are we coming to?


983
01:05:14.689 --> 01:05:17.049

the various departments.

989
01:05:31.831 --> 01:05:34.685
Marcia, you're wound tighter than a clock
this morning. What's the matter?


990
01:05:34.709 --> 01:05:35.978
Next time you propose to somebody,

991
01:05:36.002 --> 01:05:37.914
you might consider
getting unmarried first.


992
01:05:39.797 --> 01:05:43.256
Listen, Beanie told me.
It ain't as bad as you think.


993
01:05:43.343 --> 01:05:46.336
See, I got a divorce
a couple of years ago in Mexico,


994
01:05:46.429 --> 01:05:48.421
but the judge got indicted for fraud.

995
01:05:48.515 --> 01:05:51.635
- So my ex claimed that the divorce—
- Here are the latest ratings, Mr. Rhodes.


996
01:05:53.144 --> 01:05:56.228
Whoo! Hallelujah!

997
01:05:56.314 --> 01:06:01.150

998
01:06:02.612 --> 01:06:05.320
Boy, that other fella's gonna be
jumping out of windows.


999
01:06:06.115 --> 01:06:09.904
Oh, so, like I say, the ex claimed
the divorce was a fraud, too.


1000
01:06:09.994 --> 01:06:12.361
I got a good lawyer
working it out for me in Juárez.


1001
01:06:12.455 --> 01:06:15.323
He said if I come down there,
he'd get her off my back in 24 hours.


1002
01:06:16.251 --> 01:06:18.959
Larry, don't play with me.
I'm not one of your girls.


1003
01:06:19.420 --> 01:06:22.128
On a stack of bibles, Marcia.

1004
01:06:22.215 --> 01:06:24.298
Look, Saturday,
I'm going to be down in Pickett


1005
01:06:24.384 --> 01:06:26.626
judging the Arkansas
Drum Majorette Contest.


1006
01:06:26.719 --> 01:06:28.881
I'll go straight from there to Mexico.

1007
01:06:29.472 --> 01:06:33.386
The next time you hear from me,
it'll be from Juárez. Believe me.


1008
01:06:33.977 --> 01:06:37.596
- Dreadful. That is just dreadful.
- "Classics adapted while you wait.


1009
01:06:37.689 --> 01:06:40.227
We also take in laundry."
Yeah. That's a new one.


1010
01:06:40.316 --> 01:06:43.525
Hey, welcome to
the Black Hole of Calcutta.


1011
01:06:43.611 --> 01:06:47.446
- One place they didn't show the general.
- Naturally. Here you see the lepers


1012
01:06:47.532 --> 01:06:50.946
of the great television industry.
Men without faces.


1013
01:06:51.035 --> 01:06:53.072
Why, they even slide our paychecks
under the door


1014
01:06:53.162 --> 01:06:55.074
so they can pretend we're not here.

1015
01:06:55.164 --> 01:06:57.247
Ha ha ha.

1016
01:06:57.333 --> 01:06:59.825
But think of the satisfaction
of being even a small cog


1017
01:06:59.919 --> 01:07:03.253
in the great wheel of humanity
known as Lonesome Rhodes.


1018
01:07:03.339 --> 01:07:04.875
Ha ha ha.

1019
01:07:04.966 --> 01:07:07.504
Get her. Sounds like she's
coming over to our side.


1020
01:07:07.594 --> 01:07:09.176
Ha ha ha.

1021
01:07:10.430 --> 01:07:12.922
- Why don't you quit?
- Why don't you quit?


1022
01:07:13.850 --> 01:07:15.591
Because I'm deeply involved with him.

1023
01:07:16.561 --> 01:07:17.927
Spoken like a lady.

1024
01:07:19.188 --> 01:07:20.520
You got his introduction ready?

1025
01:07:21.232 --> 01:07:24.691
The hometown boy, not only making good,
but making everybody.


1026
01:07:25.612 --> 01:07:27.604
For a mild man, you sound vicious.

1027
01:07:27.697 --> 01:07:30.235
Didn't you know? 
All mild men are vicious.

1028
01:07:30.325 --> 01:07:33.614
They hate themselves for being mild
and hate the windy extroverts


1029
01:07:33.703 --> 01:07:37.367
whose violence seems to have
a strange attraction for nice girls...


1030
01:07:37.457 --> 01:07:38.538
who should know better.

1031

<i>Where America's favorite country cousin</i>

1035

<i>first got his humble start,</i>

1036
01:07:56.351 --> 01:07:58.684

1037
01:07:58.770 --> 01:08:00.432

<i>And here's the man you've been

<i>Look at them. 
Look at them!</i>

1044
01:08:17.830 --> 01:08:19.321
<i>Ain't they the most?</i>

1045
01:08:19.415 --> 01:08:25.582
<i>I mean the most! Corn-fed gals.
Country people.</i>

<i>The heart of America.

Hey, Beanie, Beanie! "L.R."

"We love L.R."

Hi, Lonesome!

1050

Hi, you all!

1051
01:09:05.169 --> 01:09:08.253
- It's dangerous.
- What, baton twirling?


1052
01:09:08.339 --> 01:09:10.547
No. Power.

1053
01:09:10.633 --> 01:09:14.126
You gotta be a saint to stand off
the power that little box can give you.


1054
01:09:18.015 --> 01:09:20.553
I got a button!

fellow Arkansasians, fellow Americans.

1075
01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:10.993
I know I should start off
with a funny story


1076
01:11:11.087 --> 01:11:12.874
about them kinfolk of mine in Riddle,

1077

but I just feel too humble this afternoon

1078
01:11:16.843 --> 01:11:20.382
as I look out upon
this fine representative body


1079
01:11:20.471 --> 01:11:22.884
<i>of wholesome young American womanhood.</i>

<i>I think it's a honest-to-God
American art form.</i>


1082
01:11:30.398 --> 01:11:33.687
Here's a little number I just wrote
and recorded for the Gold Oak label.


1083
01:11:33.776 --> 01:11:36.109
Thought you kids might enjoy
twirling to it.


1084
01:11:36.195 --> 01:11:39.029
Here she goes, "Mama Guitar."

Oh. I'm so excited.

You're my idol, honest.

1123
01:15:10.034 --> 01:15:12.697
I pasted your picture

Well, bless your heart.

- Hey, that was a great show today.


1127
01:15:23.297 --> 01:15:25.505
Better make mine milk.
I have a family, you know.


1128
01:15:25.591 --> 01:15:26.957
- Hello, Faye, Sam.
- Mace.


1129

- Good show, Dad.
- Yes, I think it had size.

Hi, Burl, Virginia.

- Mace, that baton bit was the living end.
- Thanks, Betty.

1133
01:15:39.355 --> 01:15:40.812
Glass of water, Joe.

Oh.

1135
01:15:43.818 --> 01:15:46.105
- Peach of a show, Miss Jeffries.
- Thank you.


1136
01:15:46.195 --> 01:15:47.936
Should boost the rating.

Poor Macey.

1138
01:15:53.160 --> 01:15:57.621
He lives on a diet of nitroglycerin
and Trendex ratings.


1139
01:15:57.706 --> 01:16:02.167
Call it a Bible, but it's really
a death warrant with decimal points.


1140
01:16:02.920 --> 01:16:04.627
- Hello, Bennett.
- Mr. Cerf?

1142

Miss J, just came for you.

1143
01:16:09.218 --> 01:16:12.058
One thing about being in this place,
it's just like being in the office.


1144
01:16:12.096 --> 01:16:15.180
Not quite. Joe, two more, please.

1145
01:16:15.266 --> 01:16:18.555
And this time, would you just
let the vermouth blow a kiss at the gin?


1146
01:16:19.687 --> 01:16:22.976
Oh, fine, our barefoot boy
won't be flying in tonight.


1147
01:16:23.482 --> 01:16:24.643
"Hopping over to Juárez.

1148

1149

Tell him I'll do the same for him someday.
Counting on you to hold the fort."


1150
01:16:31.031 --> 01:16:34.866
Boy, this shoulder's getting
a permanent callus from holding that fort.


1151
01:16:34.952 --> 01:16:36.284
What's in Juárez?

1152
01:16:38.038 --> 01:16:39.074
Bars.

1153
01:16:40.833 --> 01:16:42.790
Lawyers, quick marriages,

1154
01:16:44.420 --> 01:16:45.581
quick divorces.

1155
01:16:47.256 --> 01:16:48.463
Then this is it?

1156
01:16:53.137 --> 01:16:54.137
You're blushing.

1157
01:16:54.555 --> 01:16:56.672
It's these 60-to-1 martinis.

1158
01:16:59.226 --> 01:17:02.515
I suppose I should be a gentleman,
wish you all the happiness.


1159
01:17:05.274 --> 01:17:08.813
I think I'll just be a cad
and hope he chokes on a Vitajex pill.


1160
01:17:31.467 --> 01:17:32.674
You look nice.

1161
01:17:50.320 --> 01:17:51.480
Larry!

1162
01:18:09.546 --> 01:18:12.914
- Looks like he's found an all-original.
- Let's make a spot for the bride.


1163
01:18:13.008 --> 01:18:14.374
Bride? Who?

1164
01:18:14.468 --> 01:18:16.881
Listen carefully,
this is front-page stuff.


1165
01:18:27.106 --> 01:18:29.268
Officer, I'm his fiancée.

1166
01:18:29.358 --> 01:18:31.224
- Did he say "married"?
- Sure did.


1167
01:18:31.318 --> 01:18:34.482
Hey, fellas. This little lady
has just done me the honor


1168
01:18:34.571 --> 01:18:36.563
of becoming Mrs. 
Lonesome Rhodes.

1169
01:18:36.657 --> 01:18:39.024
We do'd it in Juárez!

1170
01:18:56.385 --> 01:18:58.502
Easy, fellas, I just got her.

1171
01:19:00.889 --> 01:19:02.005
They eloped.

1172
01:19:13.319 --> 01:19:16.403
- Stand back, guys.
- Go ahead, smile at them.


1173
01:19:16.488 --> 01:19:18.730
Miss. Miss, I'm Earl Wilson.

1174
01:19:18.824 --> 01:19:20.440
- What are your measurements?
- Oh!


1175
01:19:22.578 --> 01:19:25.867
What are you trying to do down there?
You out of your mind?


1176
01:19:26.707 --> 01:19:28.869
- Get it up there a little.
- That's it.


1177
01:19:28.959 --> 01:19:31.372
Their names are Tico and Pico.

1178
01:19:31.462 --> 01:19:33.203
Tico and Pico, kids.

1179
01:20:26.934 --> 01:20:29.472
Well, sir, here she is.

1180
01:20:29.978 --> 01:20:33.688
That's my little Arkansas sweet potato,
Betty Lou.


1181
01:20:35.901 --> 01:20:37.688
I ain't been so happy since the day

1182
01:20:37.778 --> 01:20:40.441
I fell into Grandpa Baskim's
hogshead of corn liquor


1183
01:20:40.531 --> 01:20:43.274
and just guzzled my
way down to dry land.

1184
01:20:43.367 --> 01:20:44.448
Ha ha!

1185
01:20:45.369 --> 01:20:48.077
I don't reckon I'll be a free man
tomorrow morning.


1186
01:20:48.705 --> 01:20:53.075
But if this ain't freedom, man,
it's the next best thing.


1187
01:21:17.192 --> 01:21:23.405
Hey. And now you wanna see
what first caught my eye?


1188
01:21:23.991 --> 01:21:25.402
Ooh!

1189
01:21:25.993 --> 01:21:28.485
And what second caught my eye.

1190
01:21:30.038 --> 01:21:31.324
Ooh!

1191
01:21:31.415 --> 01:21:36.911
And what keeps on
and on catching my eye.

1192
01:21:40.174 --> 01:21:41.381
Ladies and gentlemen,

1193
01:21:42.551 --> 01:21:46.135
I give you Mrs. 
Lonesome Rhodes

1194
01:21:46.221 --> 01:21:51.808
doing her unbelievable double-fire
baton-twirling dance


1195
01:21:51.894 --> 01:21:54.978
to the scherzo from the Seventh Symphony

1196
01:21:55.063 --> 01:21:58.022
by Ludwig van Beethoven.

1197
01:22:08.494 --> 01:22:10.907
- Mr. Rhodes.
- Tico and Pico.


1198
01:22:10.996 --> 01:22:13.534
- I could eat you up.
- Could I talk to you for a few minutes?


1199
01:22:13.624 --> 01:22:16.662
- I don't want agency jokers nagging—
- This is desperately important.


1200
01:22:16.752 --> 01:22:19.586
I've been with Browning, Schlagel
and McNally for 17 years,


1201
01:22:19.671 --> 01:22:22.084
in full charge of the international
drug account.


1202
01:22:22.174 --> 01:22:25.008
And the general just told me
that he's taking his business away.


1203
01:22:25.093 --> 01:22:28.086
Your young Mr. DePalma
has wormed his way...


1204
01:22:28.180 --> 01:22:31.014
Look, Macey, Joey DePalma's
doing one heck of a job for me.


1205
01:22:31.099 --> 01:22:33.933
But you know this business.
It's cutthroat. If a...


1206
01:22:34.019 --> 01:22:35.476
Look, Macey...

1207
01:22:35.562 --> 01:22:39.647
Well, if a rating nosedives,
or if you lose a client,


1208
01:22:39.733 --> 01:22:43.477
even if it isn't your fault,
the account executive is the goat.


1209
01:22:44.196 --> 01:22:48.190
Mr. Rhodes, if I lose this account,
I'll be fired.


1210
01:22:49.201 --> 01:22:50.487
I've got a son at Princeton.

1211
01:22:51.161 --> 01:22:54.996
Mr. Rhodes, you've seen my...
you've seen my office.


1212
01:22:56.124 --> 01:22:58.912
A corner office with four windows.

1213
01:22:59.878 --> 01:23:03.212
You know how long it takes at Browning,
Schlagel and McNally to get a corner...


1214
01:23:13.141 --> 01:23:15.884
I was afraid to marry you,
and that's the truth.


1215
01:23:15.978 --> 01:23:17.935
The dirt-root, cotton-picking truth.

1216
01:23:19.189 --> 01:23:21.602
Last time,
you said you were afraid not to.


1217
01:23:23.235 --> 01:23:24.396
Both were true.

1218
01:23:25.654 --> 01:23:27.270
You sort of overawe me.

1219
01:23:28.323 --> 01:23:29.734
You know more than I do.

1220
01:23:30.367 --> 01:23:33.155
I can feel you being
so goldarned critical all the time.


1221
01:23:33.870 --> 01:23:35.611
You and that smart-alecky Mel.

1222
01:23:36.373 --> 01:23:38.615
And you don't really approve of me.
That's so, ain't it?


1223
01:23:40.919 --> 01:23:43.957
You're getting to be all the things
you used to harpoon.


1224
01:23:44.047 --> 01:23:45.413
See what I mean?

1225
01:23:47.092 --> 01:23:50.005
The bigger I get,
the smaller you make me feel.


1226
01:23:52.014 --> 01:23:55.303
- You take Betty Lou...
- Larry, don't try to explain.


1227
01:23:57.311 --> 01:23:58.802
Betty Lou is your public,

1228
01:23:59.396 --> 01:24:02.355
all wrapped up with yellow ribbons
into one cute little package.


1229
01:24:03.400 --> 01:24:06.734
She's the logical culmination
of the great 20th-century love affair


1230
01:24:06.820 --> 01:24:09.233
between Lonesome Rhodes
and his mass audience.


1231
01:24:15.078 --> 01:24:16.078
Well...

1232
01:24:16.788 --> 01:24:18.199
I wish you wasn't so bitter.

1233
01:24:18.999 --> 01:24:20.115
I'm not bitter.

1234
01:24:21.585 --> 01:24:26.046
If I sound stridently female about
Miss Drum Majorette, I don't mean to be.


1235
01:24:26.131 --> 01:24:28.874
I knew you married her
just as a way of not marrying me.


1236
01:24:41.897 --> 01:24:43.013
Look, Marcia,

1237
01:24:43.732 --> 01:24:45.564
I'm not forgetting what I owe you.

1238
01:24:46.985 --> 01:24:49.568
I'm gonna give you a healthy slice
of our whole operation.


1239
01:24:50.072 --> 01:24:51.859
Say, ten percent of my end.

1240
01:24:51.948 --> 01:24:55.316
And you won't have to lift your finger
with what I'm giving you.


1241
01:24:55.827 --> 01:25:00.242
Giving me? Giving me?
You're not giving me anything.


1242
01:25:00.332 --> 01:25:04.121
And you're not throwing me off the train
like poor Abe Steiner, either.


1243
01:25:04.211 --> 01:25:06.203
<i>A Face in the Crowd</i> was my idea.

1244
01:25:06.296 --> 01:25:09.664
The whole idea of Lonesome Rhodes
belongs to me.


1245
01:25:09.758 --> 01:25:14.048
I always should've been an equal partner.
Well, now I'm gonna be an equal partner.


1246
01:25:14.137 --> 01:25:15.924
I'm gonna get something I deserve.

1247
01:25:16.515 --> 01:25:20.099
- Doesn't sound like you, Marcia.
- And I want it on paper!


1248
01:25:20.727 --> 01:25:22.764
Okay. All right.

1249
01:25:23.980 --> 01:25:26.097
I'll tell Joey to draw up the papers.

1250
01:25:28.485 --> 01:25:30.192
Look at yourself in the mirror, Marcia.

1251
01:25:31.238 --> 01:25:32.524
You'll see a millionaire.

1252
01:25:39.454 --> 01:25:41.161
There's always Vanderbilt '44.

1253
01:25:42.082 --> 01:25:44.870
He's gone back to Memphis.
I think he wants to forget us both.


1254
01:25:47.546 --> 01:25:51.586
I thought he'd wait for you
till there was ice on the equator.


1255
01:25:55.470 --> 01:25:57.086
That's how long he did wait.

1256
01:26:26.918 --> 01:26:30.582
When newspaper people ask me,
"Walter, where do you get all that news?"


1257
01:26:30.672 --> 01:26:34.541
I invariably tell them, "I usually get it
from an awful lot of people


1258
01:26:34.634 --> 01:26:36.717
who promised somebody else
they'd keep it secret."


1259
01:26:36.803 --> 01:26:38.339
As for example:

1260
01:26:38.430 --> 01:26:43.425
Just what is Lonesome Rhodes going
to talk to General Haynesworth about?


1261
01:26:44.102 --> 01:26:45.183
"Oh, General."

1262
01:26:45.687 --> 01:26:47.428
"Oh, Lonesome Rhodes."

1263
01:26:47.522 --> 01:26:51.015
And now Mike Wallace
interviews Senator Worthington Fuller.


1264
01:26:51.109 --> 01:26:52.712
Senator Fuller, you mean to tell me, sir,

1265
01:26:52.736 --> 01:26:56.605
that you are not infected
with the presidential itch?


1266
01:26:56.698 --> 01:26:57.779
The itch?

1267
01:27:00.494 --> 01:27:04.955
Senator, is it not a fact
that you have a date tomorrow night


1268
01:27:05.040 --> 01:27:09.250
for what is known as "Madison Avenue
coaching" from Lonesome Rhodes


1269
01:27:09.753 --> 01:27:13.042
in General Haynesworth's
private projection room?


1270
01:27:14.216 --> 01:27:18.005
<i>I have said it calls
for the closest scrutiny.</i>


1271
01:27:18.553 --> 01:27:20.966
<i>I am unable to persuade myself</i>

1272
01:27:21.640 --> 01:27:27.181
<i>and to believe in the belief that flagrant
squandering of American wealth</i>


1273
01:27:27.729 --> 01:27:31.598
<i>at home and abroad
is a road to a sound peace.</i>


1274
01:27:33.902 --> 01:27:37.441
<i>Thank you, all, and good evening, all.</i>

1275
01:27:38.615 --> 01:27:40.072
Lights!

1276
01:27:55.257 --> 01:27:58.091
I know that's not what
the American people want to hear.


1277
01:27:58.176 --> 01:28:01.135
- But I think I know what's best for them.
- We think so, too.


1278
01:28:01.221 --> 01:28:02.803
That's why everyone in this room

1279
01:28:02.889 --> 01:28:06.053
wants you to be the next President
of the United States.


1280
01:28:06.142 --> 01:28:09.601
But your problem is getting
the voters to listen to you,


1281
01:28:09.688 --> 01:28:12.601
getting them to like you enough
to listen to you.


1282
01:28:12.691 --> 01:28:14.603
Senator, I've got to be blunt.

1283
01:28:14.693 --> 01:28:18.733
Your TV appearances have been,
well, catastrophes.


1284
01:28:18.822 --> 01:28:20.108
Wouldn't you say so, Lonesome?

1285
01:28:20.740 --> 01:28:23.073
By the way, Beanie,
I asked you to check the ratings


1286
01:28:23.159 --> 01:28:25.116
when the senator was on <i>Face the People.</i>

1287
01:28:25.203 --> 01:28:26.410
Brutal.

1288
01:28:28.123 --> 01:28:30.035
Oh, excuse me. 4.2.

1289
01:28:32.294 --> 01:28:34.581
- Go right ahead, General.
- We've got to face it.


1290
01:28:34.671 --> 01:28:37.960
Politics have entered a new stage,
a television stage.


1291
01:28:38.049 --> 01:28:42.089
Instead of long-winded public debates,
the people want capsule slogans.


1292
01:28:42.178 --> 01:28:45.012
"Time for a change."
"The mess in Washington."


1293
01:28:45.098 --> 01:28:48.887
More bang for a buck.
Punch lines and glamour.


1294
01:28:48.977 --> 01:28:51.469
Yes, Mr. Pervis, even glamour.

1295
01:28:51.563 --> 01:28:54.397
General, my papers
have supported Worthington Fuller


1296
01:28:54.482 --> 01:28:56.599
from the first day he ran
for public office.


1297
01:28:56.693 --> 01:28:59.857
He's not a grandstander,
a backslapper or a baby-kisser.


1298
01:28:59.946 --> 01:29:02.359
That's exactly what he's got to become.

1299
01:29:02.449 --> 01:29:05.487
A majority in this country
don't see eye-to-eye with hinา.


1300
01:29:05.577 --> 01:29:07.785
We've got to find 35 million buyers

1301
01:29:07.871 --> 01:29:10.329
for the product we call
Worthington Fuller.


1302
01:29:10.415 --> 01:29:13.749
- I think you underestimate the respect—
- Respect?


1303
01:29:14.336 --> 01:29:16.419
Did you ever hear of anyone
buying any product...


1304
01:29:16.504 --> 01:29:20.669
beer, hair rinse, tissue—
because they respect it?


1305
01:29:21.509 --> 01:29:24.297
You gotta be loved, man.

1306
01:29:25.221 --> 01:29:26.382
Loved.

1307
01:29:27.265 --> 01:29:30.053
Well, I may be a bit old-fashioned,
but it seems to me


1308
01:29:30.143 --> 01:29:34.979
there is still a distinction between
politics and, well, the field you're in.


1309
01:29:35.065 --> 01:29:38.183
- Bull.
- I beg your pardon, sir.


1310
01:29:38.276 --> 01:29:41.064
Sorry if I tread on your corns,
but I said "bull."


1311
01:29:41.154 --> 01:29:42.520
Politics is people.

1312
01:29:42.614 --> 01:29:44.776
- Mr. Rhodes—
- Now, John...


1313
01:29:44.866 --> 01:29:48.109
The general asked me to cut
my rehearsal short to come here.


1314
01:29:48.203 --> 01:29:50.820
- If you don't wanna hear my thinking...
- Do go on, Mr. Rhodes.


1315
01:29:50.914 --> 01:29:53.452
I'm sorry to make a disturbance,
but, General...


1316
01:29:53.541 --> 01:29:57.581
Senator, I'm a professional.
I have to look at the image on that screen


1317
01:29:57.671 --> 01:29:59.913
same as I'd look at a performer
on my show.


1318
01:30:00.548 --> 01:30:05.168
And I'll have to say
he'll never get over to my audience.


1319
01:30:05.261 --> 01:30:08.299
Not to the 65 million people

1320
01:30:08.390 --> 01:30:11.133
who welcome me
into their living rooms each week.


1321
01:30:11.685 --> 01:30:16.271
And if I wouldn't buy him,
do you realize what that means?


1322
01:30:17.065 --> 01:30:18.556
If I wouldn't buy him,

1323
01:30:18.650 --> 01:30:22.314
the people of this country
aren't ready to buy him for that big job


1324
01:30:22.404 --> 01:30:23.861
on Pennsylvania Avenue.

1325
01:30:25.156 --> 01:30:27.318
Look, I got a fella here,
know where I found him?


1326
01:30:27.409 --> 01:30:29.526
I don't think he'll mind my saying it.

1327
01:30:29.619 --> 01:30:31.986
In jail. He's stupid.

1328
01:30:32.080 --> 01:30:35.244
He's got no mentality.
He thinks with his feet.


1329
01:30:36.960 --> 01:30:39.577
But I trust those feet.

1330
01:30:39.671 --> 01:30:43.711
Now, if he don't laugh,
if he don't think the show is any good,


1331
01:30:44.342 --> 01:30:46.379
then I know there's
something wrong with it,


1332
01:30:46.970 --> 01:30:50.509
something people
just ain't a-gonna take to.


1333
01:30:50.598 --> 01:30:51.759
You see what I mean?

1334
01:30:53.685 --> 01:30:54.685
Now, Beanie...

1335
01:30:56.062 --> 01:30:59.100
what did you think of the personality
you just saw on the screen?


1336
01:31:01.818 --> 01:31:06.153
- Well, I—
- Come on, give it to us straight.


1337
01:31:07.157 --> 01:31:09.365
Flatter than last night's beer.

1338
01:31:12.037 --> 01:31:13.824
You see your problem now, Senator?

1339
01:31:15.123 --> 01:31:18.787
How you gonna get this man,
this bush monkey, to vote for you?


1340
01:31:29.054 --> 01:31:30.386
Frankly, I don't know.

1341
01:31:31.347 --> 01:31:32.804
Well, maybe I do.

1342
01:31:33.933 --> 01:31:36.300
Do you know what you need
to lift your rating


1343
01:31:36.394 --> 01:31:39.978
from 4.2 to 51.7?

1344
01:31:41.399 --> 01:31:45.769
You need...
Now, hold on to your hat, my friend.


1345
01:31:47.447 --> 01:31:52.693
You need a whole new personality.

1346
01:31:52.786 --> 01:31:56.370
A new personality?
But, frankly, that's impossible.


1347
01:31:56.456 --> 01:31:58.038
Now, wait just a moment.

1348
01:31:59.417 --> 01:32:01.249
For instance, do you have a pet?

1349
01:32:01.920 --> 01:32:04.663
My wife and I have a Siamese cat.

1350
01:32:05.340 --> 01:32:06.340
Beanie?

1351
01:32:06.342 --> 01:32:08.458
Hmm.

1352
01:32:09.928 --> 01:32:12.341
My public love dogs.

1353
01:32:12.430 --> 01:32:16.219
One pitch with a hound
is worth 10,000 words.


1354
01:32:16.726 --> 01:32:20.811
That mutt didn't do Roosevelt any harm,
did it? Dick Nixon, either.


1355
01:32:21.857 --> 01:32:23.893
- That's good.
- No, I'm sure you're right.


1356
01:32:24.484 --> 01:32:26.726
How about a nickname?

1357
01:32:29.489 --> 01:32:33.699
Only dishonest thing about "Curly" Fuller
is the way he combs his hair.


1358
01:32:34.787 --> 01:32:36.118
Curly.

1359
01:32:36.204 --> 01:32:38.537
- That's rather amusing.
- See?


1360
01:32:38.623 --> 01:32:42.116
Shows you got a sense of humor about
that fine head of skin you got there.


1361
01:32:43.169 --> 01:32:45.912
No hard feelings now,
we're talking television.


1362
01:32:46.631 --> 01:32:50.295
Don't press your lips together so much.
Gives you kind of a sissy look.


1363
01:32:50.385 --> 01:32:53.048
Keep your mouth relaxed, so you can say...

1364
01:32:56.683 --> 01:32:58.140
Once in a while.

1365
01:32:59.435 --> 01:33:02.473
Uh-huh. Sounds sort of crazy
to you, doesn't it?


1366
01:33:02.564 --> 01:33:06.057
No. I realize it's a new technique,
and I've got to face it.


1367
01:33:06.151 --> 01:33:09.144
- That's why I came.
- That's a boy, Curly.


1368
01:33:09.237 --> 01:33:11.570
You just put yourself in my hands.

1369
01:33:11.656 --> 01:33:16.196
I'll have them loving him.
I mean loving him!


1370
01:33:16.286 --> 01:33:19.074
You know,
that's just what he did for Vitajex.


1371
01:33:19.914 --> 01:33:21.371
He ought to be in the cabinet.

1372
01:33:26.171 --> 01:33:27.878
I'll be going to bed now, sir.

1373
01:33:28.339 --> 01:33:32.003
Good night, Sidney. Lonesome,
I don't know anyone in the country


1374
01:33:32.093 --> 01:33:34.676
who could've won the senator
the way you did tonight.


1375
01:33:34.762 --> 01:33:37.095
- It was a brilliant piece of—
- Shut up, I'm thinking.


1376
01:33:38.016 --> 01:33:42.056
Lonesome.
Listen to me, as your adopted father.


1377
01:33:42.145 --> 01:33:47.015
You have only one flaw, the way you've
begun to suddenly shoot out of control.


1378
01:33:47.567 --> 01:33:50.310
Like this evening,
almost walking out on the senator.


1379
01:33:50.945 --> 01:33:54.313
And you're beginning to antagonize
the press. You'll grate.


1380
01:33:54.407 --> 01:33:55.523
<i>Cracker Barrel.</i>

1381
01:33:57.076 --> 01:34:00.035
<i>Lonesome Rhodes' 
Cracker Barrel.</i>

1382
01:34:00.121 --> 01:34:01.157
What's that?

1383
01:34:01.247 --> 01:34:03.455
My new show.
I want you to set it up right away.


1384
01:34:04.125 --> 01:34:07.038
Get me a whole bunch of colorful
country-looking characters


1385
01:34:07.128 --> 01:34:08.710
all sitting around,

1386
01:34:09.422 --> 01:34:12.790
listening to Lonesome Rhodes
sound off about everything


1387
01:34:12.884 --> 01:34:15.672
from the price of popcorn
to the hydrogen bomb.


1388
01:34:19.557 --> 01:34:20.923
You don't like it?

1389
01:34:22.602 --> 01:34:25.436
Well, just forget it.

1390
01:34:28.983 --> 01:34:31.225
All I've gotta do
is pick up the phone

1391
01:34:31.319 --> 01:34:33.436
and I can get Tim Andrews
of National Motors


1392
01:34:33.529 --> 01:34:35.395
to back it for me in a minute.

1393
01:34:36.032 --> 01:34:40.242
I'm not just an entertainer.
I'm an influence, a wielder of opinion.


1394
01:34:40.912 --> 01:34:42.278
A force.

1395
01:34:43.122 --> 01:34:44.613
A force.

1396
01:34:46.584 --> 01:34:49.497
<i>Now Shelton Cigarettes,
Best Friend Dog Food and Vitajex</i>


1397
01:34:49.587 --> 01:34:52.421
<i>bring you the voice of grassroot wisdom:</i>

1398
01:34:52.507 --> 01:34:55.250
<i>Lonesome Rhodes on The Cracker Barrel.</i>

1399
01:34:56.344 --> 01:35:00.588
You know, boys, what really bugs me
about our limey cousins


1400
01:35:00.682 --> 01:35:04.346
is the way they keep on trying to act
like a first-class outfit,


1401
01:35:04.435 --> 01:35:08.054
when their store is having to close up
its branches all over the world.


1402
01:35:08.147 --> 01:35:11.265
- That's telling them, Lonesome.
- That's telling 'em.


1403
01:35:12.193 --> 01:35:14.025
He's getting more global every minute.

1404
01:35:15.571 --> 01:35:17.563
That's the Lord's truth.

1405
01:35:21.577 --> 01:35:24.945
Well, look who's stopping by
to chew the fat with us


1406
01:35:25.039 --> 01:35:29.409
around the old cracker barrel.
Senator Worthington Fuller.


1407
01:35:30.461 --> 01:35:34.671
- Hey! Howdy, Curly, how's my old bunkmate?
- How are you?


1408
01:35:34.757 --> 01:35:36.419
<i>Fine. It's a real pleasant surprise.</i>

1409
01:35:36.509 --> 01:35:39.468
<i>- Come on in and meet the boys here.
- Hello, men. How are you?</i>


1410
01:35:39.554 --> 01:35:42.797
<i>Sit down here on the cracker barrel
and get your feet up on the stove.</i>


1411
01:35:42.890 --> 01:35:45.007
<i>That's a boy, now you look at home.</i>

1412
01:35:45.101 --> 01:35:47.809
<i>Well, here we are, all set for real...</i>

1413
01:35:47.895 --> 01:35:50.558
Hello, Mr. Miller.
Long time no see, et cetera, et cetera.


1414
01:35:50.648 --> 01:35:52.105
- The usual?
- Oh, yeah.


1415
01:35:52.191 --> 01:35:54.899
And just let the vermouth
blow a kiss at the gin.


1416
01:35:55.903 --> 01:35:59.487
<i>Yes, in just a little while,
I'm gonna be tossing some questions</i>


1417
01:35:59.574 --> 01:36:01.110
<i>at old Curly Fuller here.</i>

1418
01:36:01.200 --> 01:36:04.113
<i>I should say,
Senator Worthington Fuller...</i>


1419
01:36:05.246 --> 01:36:08.865
- You waiting for someone?
- No. I'm just having a quiet drink.


1420
01:36:12.378 --> 01:36:14.119
I don't remember your doing that before.

1421
01:36:15.131 --> 01:36:17.418
Well, I have to talk to
a thousand people a day.


1422
01:36:17.508 --> 01:36:19.249
This gives me a chance to unwind.

1423
01:36:19.344 --> 01:36:21.280
...<i>got from guzzling
too much rye whiskey.</i>


1424
01:36:21.304 --> 01:36:24.672
<i>We didn't know that swallowing
too much raw politics</i>


1425
01:36:24.766 --> 01:36:26.098
<i>can put a crease in your head</i>

1426
01:36:26.184 --> 01:36:29.302
<i>a whole lot deeper than that
homemade Kickapoo joy juice</i>


1427
01:36:29.395 --> 01:36:32.684
<i>that we used to concoct
back in Arkansas. Heh.</i>


1428
01:36:33.316 --> 01:36:37.276
<i>I wished you'd give me the real
cotton-picking truth about how you feel</i>


1429
01:36:37.362 --> 01:36:41.902
<i>on the subject of more and more
and more Social Security.</i>


1430
01:36:42.992 --> 01:36:45.279
<i>I'm glad you asked me that question,
Lonesome.</i>


1431
01:36:46.454 --> 01:36:49.447
<i>I'd say that people today are obsessed...</i>

1432
01:36:49.540 --> 01:36:50.826
<i>Huh?</i>

1433
01:36:50.917 --> 01:36:54.877
<i>I mean, real gone for security.</i>

1434
01:36:54.962 --> 01:36:59.081
<i>They want protection, coddling
from the cradle to the grave.</i>


1435
01:36:59.175 --> 01:37:01.337
<i>I say that weakens the moral fiber.</i>

1436
01:37:02.095 --> 01:37:05.054
<i>Why, Daniel Boone wasn't looking
for unemployment insurance</i>


1437
01:37:05.139 --> 01:37:06.721
<i>and old-age pension.</i>

1438
01:37:07.392 --> 01:37:09.759
<i>All he needed was
his ax and his gun</i>

1439
01:37:09.852 --> 01:37:14.142
<i>and a chance to hew a living
out of the forest with his own hands.</i>


1440
01:37:14.607 --> 01:37:17.475
- Real woodsy, ain't he?
<i>- That's telling them, Senator.</i>


1441
01:37:17.568 --> 01:37:20.902
<i>You heard one that time.
Ha ha! That's a boy.</i>


1442
01:37:20.988 --> 01:37:23.196
<i>That's the spirit
that built this country.</i>


1443
01:37:23.282 --> 01:37:25.945
Joe, would you turn that sound down
a little bit, please?


1444
01:37:26.661 --> 01:37:28.573
<i>Not big government.</i>

1445
01:37:28.663 --> 01:37:31.872
I'll say one thing for him,
he's got the courage of his ignorance.


1446
01:37:34.335 --> 01:37:36.327
Well, how's our old station in Memphis?

1447
01:37:37.505 --> 01:37:41.715
I didn't go near it.
I've been writing a book about...


1448
01:37:43.469 --> 01:37:45.711
I call it <i>Demagogue in Denim.</i>

1449
01:37:49.475 --> 01:37:51.341
Never had such a
good time in my life.

1450
01:37:54.063 --> 01:37:55.850
Well, you look wonderful.

1451
01:37:56.607 --> 01:38:01.022
All those months he was calling me
Vanderbilt '44 and Frontal Lobe...


1452
01:38:02.155 --> 01:38:05.148
when I should've been
punching him in the nose.


1453
01:38:05.825 --> 01:38:08.568
Well, now I got the book
to punch him in the nose.


1454
01:38:09.579 --> 01:38:10.911
Is it gonna be published?

1455
01:38:15.251 --> 01:38:19.040
Came up to sign the contracts.
Publishers are real high on it.


1456
01:38:19.130 --> 01:38:21.747
They think the time is right
to pull the mask off him.


1457
01:38:21.841 --> 01:38:24.128
Let the public see what a fraud
he really is.


1458
01:38:24.218 --> 01:38:25.880
Mel, I wouldn't say that.

1459
01:38:28.222 --> 01:38:29.554
What would you say?

1460
01:38:30.433 --> 01:38:33.301
Well, it's just that it's harder for him
to be as simple as he was


1461
01:38:33.394 --> 01:38:35.886
with all those generals and senators

1462
01:38:35.980 --> 01:38:38.188
and political big shots
hanging around him all the time.


1463
01:38:39.066 --> 01:38:40.273
You're still with him.

1464
01:38:43.696 --> 01:38:46.734
Well, at least I tone down
some of the crazier notions


1465
01:38:46.824 --> 01:38:48.281
he wants to spout on the air.

1466
01:38:48.367 --> 01:38:50.984
And I seem to be the only person
he can talk to anymore.


1467
01:38:51.829 --> 01:38:54.242
I keep a lot of people
from getting fired, and...


1468
01:38:56.876 --> 01:38:59.118
well, there's an awful lot of money
at stake.


1469
01:38:59.962 --> 01:39:02.670
Our agency, the one we started
with International Drug Account,


1470
01:39:02.757 --> 01:39:05.170
is doing a gross business
of over 100 million a year.


1471
01:39:05.259 --> 01:39:07.376
- And how are the Mama Guitars selling?
- Mm.


1472
01:39:13.559 --> 01:39:15.175
Mel, I found him.

1473
01:39:18.022 --> 01:39:21.982
He's mine for better or worse, and I keep
doing my small bit to make him better.


1474
01:39:23.611 --> 01:39:25.694
Marcia, you know what you are?
You're the locker room


1475
01:39:25.780 --> 01:39:29.194
where he eases up after the fight,
win or lose.


1476
01:39:29.283 --> 01:39:33.027
You're the shock absorber for collisions
with ex-wives and models


1477
01:39:33.120 --> 01:39:35.612
and new wives and assorted tramps.

1478
01:39:36.332 --> 01:39:37.948
You're the little wheel of efficiency

1479
01:39:38.042 --> 01:39:40.830
without which the great
streamlined express called Lonesome Rhodes


1480
01:39:40.920 --> 01:39:43.754
plunges off the track
and leaps to destruction.


1481
01:39:43.839 --> 01:39:46.252
I can hardly wait to read that book.

1482
01:39:47.760 --> 01:39:51.720
Don't you worry, I've spared you
more than you've spared yourself.


1483
01:39:54.392 --> 01:39:55.428
I know.

1484
01:39:57.311 --> 01:39:58.347
I know.

1485
01:40:04.277 --> 01:40:07.861
I'll call you again sometime,
when I think you're ready.


1486
01:40:16.914 --> 01:40:20.578
Hey, Betty Lou,
take a look at this Gallup Poll.


1487
01:40:21.544 --> 01:40:24.833
I got Curly up from 3 percent
of the voters to 11.


1488
01:40:24.922 --> 01:40:29.883
Heh! Eleven! That's a lucky number.
He's gonna be in.


1489
01:40:31.012 --> 01:40:32.378
Hey, sweet patootie,

1490
01:40:33.139 --> 01:40:35.847
look who's home, your big papa man.

1491
01:40:35.933 --> 01:40:36.969
Ha ha!

1492
01:40:53.743 --> 01:40:55.279
You're not going to hit me.

1493
01:40:56.746 --> 01:41:00.114
Don't play the noble defender
of the sanctity of marriage with me.


1494
01:41:00.207 --> 01:41:01.768
I know where you've been
some of those nights


1495
01:41:01.792 --> 01:41:03.328
when Betty was waiting up for you.

1496
01:41:04.003 --> 01:41:05.915
You hit me,
and it'll be all over the papers.


1497
01:41:06.005 --> 01:41:07.774
As much as the people love you tonight,
they can hate you...


1498
01:41:07.798 --> 01:41:09.710
You're fired.
You're through with Lonesome...


1499
01:41:09.800 --> 01:41:12.588
I've got news that'll move you
and shake you.


1500
01:41:12.678 --> 01:41:15.386
I'm president
of Lonesome Rhodes Enterprises.


1501
01:41:15.473 --> 01:41:19.012
I own 51 percent of the voting stock.

1502
01:41:19.644 --> 01:41:23.103
You're in bed with me, Larry. In bed.

1503
01:41:44.085 --> 01:41:45.121
Get me Beanie.

1504
01:41:46.253 --> 01:41:48.495
Think I'll just freshen up my soda.

1505
01:41:48.589 --> 01:41:49.589
Beanie.

1506
01:41:50.174 --> 01:41:53.042
Get Mrs. Rhodes a "broomette"
on the next train to Little Rock.


1507
01:41:53.928 --> 01:41:56.636
You don't own 51 percent of the stock.
You're fired.


1508
01:41:56.722 --> 01:41:57.722
Fired?

1509
01:41:58.099 --> 01:42:02.810
Oh, Lonesome. Lonesome, nothing...
nothing happened, really.


1510
01:42:09.026 --> 01:42:12.066
<i>This program 's being
brought to you by Shelton cigarettes.</i>


1511
01:42:12.113 --> 01:42:14.730
<i>And ooh, Vitajex...</i>

1512
01:42:14.824 --> 01:42:17.862
I'm gonna treat you like any performer
on my show that flops.


1513
01:42:18.869 --> 01:42:20.610
I got a contract with you.

1514
01:42:21.163 --> 01:42:24.497
You'll get your money every week
as long as you stay in Arkansas.


1515
01:42:26.502 --> 01:42:28.243
But I don't wanna go home.

1516
01:42:28.963 --> 01:42:31.797
Besides, Ed Sullivan wants me to do
my double-fire baton dance


1517
01:42:31.882 --> 01:42:33.339
on his show Sunday night.

1518
01:42:33.426 --> 01:42:36.385
You can do your double-fire
baton-twirling dance


1519
01:42:36.470 --> 01:42:39.429
in the ladies' room
of the Little Rock depot.


1520
01:42:40.891 --> 01:42:42.098
No!

1521
01:42:52.153 --> 01:42:54.153
Marcia, can you hear me?

1522
01:42:54.196 --> 01:42:55.937
Get up! Wake up!

1523
01:42:56.490 --> 01:42:58.857
It's me, big me! The king!

1524
01:42:59.535 --> 01:43:01.367
Come on, Marcia, open up.

1525
01:43:01.454 --> 01:43:04.117
I said, hurry up on this door, Marcia.

1526
01:43:04.206 --> 01:43:05.742
Lonesome's back.

1527
01:43:10.880 --> 01:43:14.339
Just got rid of Betty Lou.
Sweet-talking little floozy.


1528
01:43:14.425 --> 01:43:16.587
She'd have ruined me,
that's what she'd have done.


1529
01:43:17.178 --> 01:43:19.670
- Fix me a drink.
- What are you doing?


1530
01:43:19.764 --> 01:43:22.256
We'll have to be more careful
than we used to be.


1531
01:43:22.349 --> 01:43:25.057
I'll have to stay married
till I get my new appointment.


1532
01:43:25.728 --> 01:43:28.141
- Your what?
- This is still top-secret.


1533
01:43:28.606 --> 01:43:30.438
The general's been talking to Fuller.

1534
01:43:31.150 --> 01:43:34.359
He's selling him on the idea
of creating a new cabinet post for me.


1535
01:43:35.404 --> 01:43:40.115
"In time of imminent crisis and danger."
That's the way the general puts it.


1536
01:43:40.201 --> 01:43:42.614
Who could rally the people
better than I could?


1537
01:43:42.703 --> 01:43:45.320
Hold them in line
right behind the government.


1538
01:43:46.165 --> 01:43:48.999
If we put Fuller across
the way I know we're gonna,


1539
01:43:49.084 --> 01:43:50.666
he's gonna owe me that.

1540
01:43:51.462 --> 01:43:54.421
Secretary for National Morale.

1541
01:43:55.132 --> 01:43:59.297
How's that sound to you, Marcia?
Secretary for National Morale.


1542
01:44:01.639 --> 01:44:03.972
General's asking Fuller
to shake hands on it with me


1543
01:44:04.058 --> 01:44:05.952
after the big banquet I'm throwing
tomorrow night,


1544
01:44:05.976 --> 01:44:07.217
launching Fighters for Fuller.

1545
01:44:08.395 --> 01:44:10.978
- Fighters for Fuller.
- Yeah, Fighters for Fuller.


1546
01:44:11.065 --> 01:44:13.978
How do you like that name, huh?
Huh? Huh? Huh?


1547
01:44:14.068 --> 01:44:16.606
I made it up. Everybody's nuts about it.

1548
01:44:16.695 --> 01:44:18.732
I got 20 of the biggest men
in this country


1549
01:44:18.823 --> 01:44:21.259
coming to my banquet tomorrow night
to get Fighters for Fuller rolling.


1550
01:44:21.283 --> 01:44:23.775
I got a retired admiral
from the Joint Chiefs, two governors,


1551
01:44:23.869 --> 01:44:27.453
some of them big investment-house boys,
and a cabinet minister.


1552
01:44:27.540 --> 01:44:30.658
- Which one?
- I don't know.


1553
01:44:30.751 --> 01:44:32.788
I told the general to
pick one out for me.

1554
01:44:32.878 --> 01:44:34.790
And they're coming to your party?

1555
01:44:34.880 --> 01:44:38.214
Oh, honey. If I
ask them, they gotta come.

1556
01:44:38.801 --> 01:44:41.339
Baby, they'd be afraid not to come.

1557
01:44:41.428 --> 01:44:44.512
I could murder them like this:

1558
01:44:49.937 --> 01:44:51.473
I'm afraid it's true.

1559
01:44:52.231 --> 01:44:53.438
What's true?

1560
01:44:55.568 --> 01:45:00.609
Right here, tonight,
you might have that much power.


1561
01:45:00.698 --> 01:45:02.018
See the new ratings this morning?

1562
01:45:02.783 --> 01:45:07.448
Fifty-three-point-seven.

1563
01:45:07.538 --> 01:45:09.655
Just picked up another million.

1564
01:45:09.748 --> 01:45:13.241
This whole country's
just like my flock of sheep.


1565
01:45:13.961 --> 01:45:15.953
- Sheep.
- Rednecks,


1566
01:45:16.046 --> 01:45:20.541
crackers, hillbillies, hausfraus,
shut-ins, pea-pickers.


1567
01:45:20.634 --> 01:45:24.048
Everybody that's got to jump
when somebody else blows the whistle.


1568
01:45:25.431 --> 01:45:29.971
They don't know it yet, but they're
all gonna be Fighters for Fuller.


1569
01:45:30.060 --> 01:45:33.553
They're mine. I own them.
They think like I do.


1570
01:45:35.316 --> 01:45:38.855
Only they're even more stupid than I am,
so I gotta think for them.


1571
01:45:39.445 --> 01:45:41.482
Marcia, you just wait and see.

1572
01:45:41.572 --> 01:45:43.859
I'm gonna be the power
behind the president,


1573
01:45:43.949 --> 01:45:45.941
and you'll be the power behind me.

1574
01:45:55.169 --> 01:45:56.831
You made me, Marcia.

1575
01:45:57.671 --> 01:45:58.912
You made me.

1576
01:46:00.132 --> 01:46:01.418
I always say that.

1577
01:46:03.010 --> 01:46:04.592
I owe it all to you.

1578
01:46:05.930 --> 01:46:07.922
I owe it all to you.

1579
01:46:09.391 --> 01:46:11.053
All to you.

1580
01:46:12.519 --> 01:46:15.478
I know it. I know it.

1581
01:46:16.690 --> 01:46:17.897
I know it.

1582
01:46:27.242 --> 01:46:28.653
Turn the light out.

1583
01:46:41.757 --> 01:46:42.873
I'm tired.

1584
01:46:44.802 --> 01:46:46.134
Big day tomorrow.

1585
01:46:48.055 --> 01:46:49.546
Real big day.

1586
01:46:55.729 --> 01:46:57.140
Real big day.

1587
01:47:08.742 --> 01:47:11.450
Come on, come on,
I got to get some sleep.


1588
01:47:17.543 --> 01:47:18.704
Marcia!

1589
01:47:19.670 --> 01:47:21.206
Marcia, where you going?

1590
01:47:44.945 --> 01:47:47.688
Well, all I can say is,
tonight's show is gonna be a mess.


1591
01:47:47.781 --> 01:47:51.149
Now you tell me the show's in a mess.
Now you tell me.


1592
01:47:51.243 --> 01:47:54.327
Yes, but you see,
Marcia never showed up all day.


1593
01:47:54.413 --> 01:47:58.908
- She's the only one who can coordinate.
- Coordinate, hell.


1594
01:47:59.001 --> 01:48:01.084
You mean to tell me
the success of my show

1595
01:48:01.170 --> 01:48:05.540
depends on one self-important,
neurotic, temperamental female?


1596
01:48:05.632 --> 01:48:10.218
I'm fed up with the whole lot of you
incompetents, nincompoops, bootlickers.


1597
01:48:10.304 --> 01:48:13.092
Would you like some hot coffee,
Mr. Rhodes?


1598
01:48:16.727 --> 01:48:21.643
Is that your subtle way
of trying to tell me I'm swacked?


1599
01:48:22.399 --> 01:48:25.392
Well, I'm not drunk, just disgusted!

1600
01:48:26.862 --> 01:48:29.024
- Okay, I'll handle it.
- Of course you will.


1601
01:48:29.114 --> 01:48:32.903
Ad-lib. Just keep up with me.

1602
01:48:33.744 --> 01:48:35.326
I've saved the show before.

1603
01:48:36.663 --> 01:48:39.872
Well, I just wonder what they do
with their afternoons.


1604
01:48:39.958 --> 01:48:41.699
- Wives and all.
- Ready, two.


1605
01:48:41.794 --> 01:48:45.128
- One more day like this, and I'm...
- Here she comes now.


1606
01:48:45.214 --> 01:48:47.877
Where've you been?
We've been trying to find you all day.


1607
01:48:47.966 --> 01:48:49.832
Take two.

1608
01:48:49.927 --> 01:48:51.821
- You know how important that is.
- I don't care.


1609
01:48:51.845 --> 01:48:54.508
We still haven't got
our commercials routine.


1610
01:48:54.598 --> 01:48:55.598
Take three.

1611
01:48:56.141 --> 01:48:59.100
I know that's kind of gone out of style,
like the corset.


1612
01:48:59.978 --> 01:49:01.765
But every once in
a while, I ask myself,

1613
01:49:02.272 --> 01:49:06.812
"Lonesome,
where's that un-modern uncomplicated,


1614
01:49:06.902 --> 01:49:11.522
un-liberated,
but oh-so-happy one-man woman gone?"


1615
01:49:13.617 --> 01:49:17.281
Ain't no use getting ourselves all het up
about something we can't change.


1616
01:49:18.372 --> 01:49:20.785
Curly and I was out duck-shooting
over the weekend.


1617
01:49:20.874 --> 01:49:24.788
Brought my little movie camera along
to show you folks what it was like.


1618
01:49:25.879 --> 01:49:27.541
- Roll the film.
- Roll film.


1619
01:49:28.715 --> 01:49:29.715
Hit it.

1620
01:49:30.509 --> 01:49:34.048
Hey, you lunkheads up there in
the projection room, show us the movie!


1621
01:49:34.138 --> 01:49:36.178
You're off the air, Mr. Rhodes.
They can't hear you.


1622
01:49:40.602 --> 01:49:41.718
It's about time.

1623
01:49:42.479 --> 01:49:44.391
I wanna talk to you.

1624
01:49:44.481 --> 01:49:47.565
I can't tonight because
I gotta rush over to the banquet.


1625
01:49:47.651 --> 01:49:52.021
But first thing in the morning.
In my office, in the morning.


1626
01:49:52.114 --> 01:49:54.606
Twenty seconds, Mr. Rhodes.
Twenty seconds.


1627
01:49:54.700 --> 01:49:57.534
Who can take this? I quit today.

1628
01:49:59.788 --> 01:50:01.683
<i>Even after the senator
had bagged his limit,</i>


1629
01:50:01.707 --> 01:50:03.539
<i>how he hated to leave that blind.</i>

1630
01:50:04.084 --> 01:50:06.497
<i>He says to me, he says, "Lonesome..."</i>

1631
01:50:06.587 --> 01:50:08.078
Keep the door clear.

1632
01:50:08.172 --> 01:50:11.006
I'm surrounded by a lot of
dim-witted sons of...


1633
01:50:11.633 --> 01:50:14.922
Hey, you redneck scoundrels still here?

1634
01:50:15.012 --> 01:50:16.924
Why ain't you out working someplace?

1635
01:50:17.014 --> 01:50:20.974
Ha! Ain't that Curly Fuller
a duck-shooting fool?


1636
01:50:21.059 --> 01:50:22.345
- Real man.
- Sure is.


1637
01:50:22.978 --> 01:50:26.312
You know, when we was standing there
shoulder to shoulder in that cold water,


1638
01:50:26.398 --> 01:50:27.934
belly-button high,

1639
01:50:28.025 --> 01:50:30.483
and the sun is commencing
to smile in on us,


1640
01:50:31.445 --> 01:50:33.937
Curly looked at me, and he says,
"Lonesome,


1641
01:50:34.031 --> 01:50:37.399
<i>the family that prays together
stays together."</i>


1642
01:50:38.577 --> 01:50:39.909
<i>That's what he said.</i>

1643
01:50:39.995 --> 01:50:43.363
I tell you, that man is an inspiration.

1644
01:50:43.457 --> 01:50:45.449
<i>A man among men.</i>

1645
01:50:46.877 --> 01:50:51.247
<i>The Cracker Barrel, starring
that irrepressible Arkansas traveler.</i>


1646
01:50:52.507 --> 01:50:53.466
You're off.

1647
01:50:53.468 --> 01:50:55.049
Whew!

1648
01:50:55.135 --> 01:50:56.546
I'm glad that's over.

1649
01:50:57.304 --> 01:50:59.887
I'm gonna start shooting people
instead of ducks.


1650
01:50:59.973 --> 01:51:03.307
<i>For relaxation and for health.</i>

1651

<i>The cigarette that cleans your tobacco
without a filter.</i>


1652
01:51:07.272 --> 01:51:10.606
<i>- And by Best Friend Dog Food...</i>
- Take one.


1653
01:51:10.692 --> 01:51:12.558
<i>...your dog's best friend.</i>

1654
01:51:12.653 --> 01:51:16.613
<i>And by Vitajex, that old
"Vitajex, what you doing to me" pill.</i>


1655
01:51:19.701 --> 01:51:23.365
Well, hurry back, you all.
Remember what old Uncle Lonesome said.


1656
01:51:23.789 --> 01:51:27.282
The family that prays together
stays together.


1657
01:51:32.798 --> 01:51:35.461
All right, super, one,
and start the crawl.


1658
01:51:35.926 --> 01:51:38.384
<i>This has been an FBN production.</i>

1659
01:51:39.930 --> 01:51:42.263
Fuller, the great hunter. Heh!

1660
01:51:42.349 --> 01:51:44.636
He's shaking like this.

1661
01:51:45.352 --> 01:51:48.766
Oh, if they ever heard the way
that psycho really talks.


1662
01:51:48.855 --> 01:51:51.188
<i>Choreography, 
Don Krantz.</i>

<i>Costumes by Robert Hodes.</i>

<i>Unit manager, George K. George.</i>

1666
01:51:59.241 --> 01:52:01.483
Can you really sell that stiff
as a man among men?


1667
01:52:01.576 --> 01:52:03.408
To those morons out there?

1668
01:52:04.288 --> 01:52:08.874
Shucks, I can take chicken fertilizer
and sell it to them for caviar.


1669
01:52:10.043 --> 01:52:12.501
I can make them eat dog food,
and they'll think it's steak.


1670
01:52:13.588 --> 01:52:16.706
Sure, I got them like this.

<i>You know what the public's like?
A cage full of guinea pigs.</i>

<i>Good night, you stupid idiots.</i>

1673
01:52:27.185 --> 01:52:30.428
<i>Good night, you miserable slobs.</i>

1674
01:52:31.857 --> 01:52:34.065
<i>They're a lot of trained seals.</i>

<i>I toss them a dead fish,

<i>♪ Well, just a
closer walk with thee ♪</i>

1677
01:52:46.330 --> 01:52:48.913
No!

1678
01:52:49.708 --> 01:52:51.495
Why, he's a monster!

1679
01:52:51.585 --> 01:52:54.828
I'm gonna call the station
and give them a piece of my mind.


1680
01:52:55.882 --> 01:52:58.498
We'll fix you, jerk.

1681
01:52:59.676 --> 01:53:04.387
I knew he'd open his big yap
once too often and blow my three Gs.


1682
01:53:04.473 --> 01:53:07.511
Mr. Macey, I can hardly believe
that's the same Lonesome Rhodes.


1683
01:53:07.601 --> 01:53:11.766
It is, only this time
his personality finally came through.


1684
01:53:13.023 --> 01:53:14.059
Give me a drink.

1685
01:53:16.193 --> 01:53:18.685
Gotta hurry, boys.
Heap-big important date.


1686
01:53:19.404 --> 01:53:22.693
You better come in strong tomorrow,
I'll be loaded for bear.


1687
01:53:22.783 --> 01:53:23.783
Come on, Beanie.

1688
01:53:31.041 --> 01:53:34.910
Held the elevator for you, Mr. R.
The Lonesome Rhodes Express, going down.


1689
01:53:35.003 --> 01:53:37.495
- All the way down, lad.
- Yes, sir.


1690
01:53:43.303 --> 01:53:46.671
Federal Broadcasting Network.
That line is busy.


1691
01:53:46.765 --> 01:53:50.384
You can just tell him I'll never listen
to his filthy program again.


1692
01:53:52.604 --> 01:53:56.063
So we're slobs, are we?
You can tell Lonesome Rhodes for me...


1693
01:53:56.149 --> 01:53:57.230
FBN.

1694
01:54:00.570 --> 01:54:03.187
I said, are we paying your network

1695
01:54:03.281 --> 01:54:05.739
to build up our business or destroy it?

1696
01:54:05.826 --> 01:54:08.694
Now, just a minute, General.
Get DePalma on the phone.


1697
01:54:08.787 --> 01:54:12.747
Remember, it was your advertising company
that brought Lonesome Rhodes to FBN.


1698
01:54:15.752 --> 01:54:18.586
I'd like keep this candle
from rubbing off on Vitajex.


1699
01:54:18.672 --> 01:54:20.834
I mean dissociate ourselves.

1700
01:54:20.924 --> 01:54:23.291
Lonesome Rhodes. 
That line is busy.

1701
01:54:26.012 --> 01:54:27.378
Board's burning up. 
What'd he say?

1702
01:54:27.472 --> 01:54:29.158
I don't know,
but it must have been a whopper.


1703
01:54:29.182 --> 01:54:31.515
Better come up fast
with a good replacement.


1704
01:54:33.937 --> 01:54:35.018
I got you down in a hurry.

1705
01:54:35.105 --> 01:54:37.768
Give him a buck for not stopping
to pick up the peasants.


1706
01:54:37.858 --> 01:54:39.144
How's your rating, Page?

1707
01:54:40.694 --> 01:54:42.731
No, I'm sorry.
Mr. Rhodes has left for the day.


1708
01:54:42.821 --> 01:54:45.234
No, I'm sorry,
there's no one in the studio.


1709
01:54:45.323 --> 01:54:48.361
That's right, DePalma, you know
your contract, the morals clause.


1710
01:54:48.452 --> 01:54:50.569
Any act abusing public confidence.

1711
01:54:50.662 --> 01:54:52.654
I think I've got just the boy
to fill the gap.


1712
01:54:53.331 --> 01:54:55.744
Yeah, Barry Mills. Mm-hmm.

1713
01:54:56.835 --> 01:54:59.498
He's a young Lonesome Rhodes
and a lot easier to handle.


1714
01:54:59.588 --> 01:55:01.625
Buddy, I'm just a country boy.

1715
01:55:03.383 --> 01:55:04.499
Don't spare the horses.

1716
01:55:04.593 --> 01:55:06.960
I've only got 30 minutes
to get into my dinner clothes.


1717
01:55:16.688 --> 01:55:19.305
"L.R.'s Blooper Tops Unk Don's."

1718
01:55:20.192 --> 01:55:23.776
I never seen what people saw in that guy,
but whatever it was, he's had it.


1719
01:55:28.408 --> 01:55:30.845
Like the sinking of the <i>Titanic.</i>
A night to remember. What happened?


1720
01:55:30.869 --> 01:55:32.781
Marcia, she went, uh...

1721
01:55:32.871 --> 01:55:35.079
- Where is she?
- She's still in the booth.


1722
01:55:50.430 --> 01:55:52.638
I hear you just wrote the ending
to my book.


1723
01:55:59.898 --> 01:56:00.898
Yeah?

1724
01:56:03.485 --> 01:56:05.101
Just a minute, 
I'll see if she's here.

1725
01:56:07.781 --> 01:56:08.781
It's him.

1726
01:56:09.574 --> 01:56:11.315
I've got her. I've got her.

1727
01:56:11.409 --> 01:56:12.445
Marcia.

1728
01:56:13.328 --> 01:56:18.198
Oh, Marcia, I need you.
Come over right away.


1729
01:56:18.291 --> 01:56:22.956
Nobody's come, everybody canceled out.
Fuller didn't even send me a wire.


1730
01:56:23.046 --> 01:56:25.003
The general sent me a wire.

1731
01:56:25.090 --> 01:56:27.707
<i>The Secretary of the Interior
sent me a wire.</i>


1732
01:56:27.801 --> 01:56:30.965
<i>"Regret to inform you."
"Unavoidably detained."</i>


1733
01:56:31.054 --> 01:56:32.636
<i>"Unable to attend."</i>

1734
01:56:32.722 --> 01:56:35.180
<i>All of a sudden, everybody's too busy.</i>

1735
01:56:35.267 --> 01:56:37.509
All of a sudden, I'm... I'm poison.

1736
01:56:47.404 --> 01:56:48.485
You laughing at me?

1737
01:56:49.656 --> 01:56:52.694
<i>Huh? You laughing at me?</i>

1738
01:56:53.827 --> 01:56:55.489
<i>You think I'm washed up, don't you?</i>

1739
01:56:55.996 --> 01:56:58.909
<i>The same way I lost them,
I'll get them back again.</i>


1740
01:56:58.999 --> 01:57:00.831
<i>I'm gonna make them love me.</i>

1741
01:57:01.960 --> 01:57:03.246
You're gonna love me.

1742
01:57:04.087 --> 01:57:07.080
Say you're gonna love me.
Say you're gonna love me.


1743
01:57:07.841 --> 01:57:10.834
You're gonna love me.
You're gonna love me.


1744
01:57:11.636 --> 01:57:13.798
<i>All right, say you're gonna love me.</i>

1745
01:57:13.888 --> 01:57:16.255
<i>All right, you, say you're gonna love me.</i>

1746
01:57:16.349 --> 01:57:18.932
Say you're gonna love me!
You're gonna love me!


1747
01:57:19.019 --> 01:57:20.806
- What's your name?
- Francis.


1748
01:57:20.895 --> 01:57:23.763
Francis, you're gonna love me!
Francis, you're gonna love me!


1749
01:57:23.857 --> 01:57:25.644
Love me, love me!

1750
01:57:26.735 --> 01:57:31.150
Get out. Get out. Get out,
you dressed-up black monkeys.


1751
01:57:31.239 --> 01:57:33.947
You turn my stomach. Get out!

1752
01:57:34.993 --> 01:57:36.985
He sounds like he's finally
gone through the roof.


1753
01:57:37.912 --> 01:57:40.279
Marcia. Marcia, how soon can you get here?

1754
01:57:40.373 --> 01:57:41.784
I'm surrounded by traitors.

1755
01:57:41.875 --> 01:57:44.413
That engineer, wait till I get him.

1756
01:57:44.502 --> 01:57:47.791
<i>I'll fire him.
I'll burn him over a slow fire.</i>


1757
01:57:48.590 --> 01:57:52.675
Marcia, if you don't come right away,
I'll jump!


1758
01:57:53.094 --> 01:57:57.179
<i>- I'll jump! I'll jump!</i>
- Jump. Jump!


1759
01:57:57.265 --> 01:57:59.052
Get out of my life!

1760
01:57:59.643 --> 01:58:01.851
Get out of everybody's life.

1761
01:58:02.604 --> 01:58:03.640
Jump.

1762
01:58:04.522 --> 01:58:05.522
Jump.

1763
01:58:06.816 --> 01:58:07.977
Jump.

1764
01:58:15.992 --> 01:58:17.073
I don't believe you.

1765
01:58:17.786 --> 01:58:19.527
- In an hour, you'll be up there.
- Oh, Mel.


1766
01:58:19.621 --> 01:58:21.515
Why didn't you tell him on the phone
that it was you?


1767
01:58:21.539 --> 01:58:23.622
- Because it's hard to.
- Let's make it harder.


1768
01:58:24.584 --> 01:58:26.544
I think you should go up
and tell him face to face


1769
01:58:26.628 --> 01:58:28.585
before he blames it on 20 other guys.

1770
01:58:29.130 --> 01:58:31.292
Face to face,
and then maybe I'll believe you.


1771
01:58:31.883 --> 01:58:33.545
It's never as simple as that.

1772
01:58:33.635 --> 01:58:38.346
Finally, you gotta force complicated
things into simple channels like this.


1773
01:58:39.474 --> 01:58:41.452
Either you go up there
and tell him it was you who did it


1774
01:58:41.476 --> 01:58:43.468
and chop it off clean

1775
01:58:43.561 --> 01:58:45.473
so he never comes crying to you again,

1776
01:58:46.064 --> 01:58:49.728
or you hold his hand,
wipe his poor, perspiring brow,


1777
01:58:49.818 --> 01:58:53.858
fan his smoldering, dampened ego
so it can burst up into flames and burn...


1778
01:58:57.867 --> 01:59:00.985
Secretary for National Morale

1779
01:59:01.079 --> 01:59:04.698
is a job that I was born for.

1780
01:59:04.791 --> 01:59:06.231
Somebody ought to send for a doctor.

1781
01:59:06.292 --> 01:59:08.249
He's been screaming like that
for 20 minutes.


1782
01:59:09.212 --> 01:59:11.625
In a time of crisis,

1783
01:59:11.715 --> 01:59:15.925
who else could rally the people
like Lonesome Rhodes?


1784
01:59:16.010 --> 01:59:21.802
Who else could move the people to action
like Lonesome Rhodes?


1785
01:59:21.891 --> 01:59:27.512
Ha! You are looking at America's answer

1786
01:59:27.605 --> 01:59:31.690
to the crying need for national...

1787
01:59:31.776 --> 01:59:33.062
What you doing that for?

1788
01:59:33.153 --> 01:59:35.395
- He likes lots of applause.
- Beanie.


1789
01:59:43.663 --> 01:59:45.950
Maybe I'm just a country boy.

1790
01:59:47.584 --> 01:59:49.621
But if the president tries to stop me,

1791
01:59:50.295 --> 01:59:54.164
I'll flood the White House
with millions of telegrams.


1792
01:59:55.133 --> 01:59:58.501
I made him, and I can break him.

1793
01:59:58.595 --> 02:00:00.837
Yeah! Ha!

1794
02:00:00.930 --> 02:00:02.796
Yeah, you know I can.

1795
02:00:04.017 --> 02:00:07.431
Because the people listen
to Lonesome Rhodes.


1796
02:00:07.520 --> 02:00:12.015
Because the people love Lonesome Rhodes.

1797
02:00:12.108 --> 02:00:15.943
Lonesome Rhodes is the people.

1798
02:00:16.029 --> 02:00:19.773
The people is Lonesome Rhodes.

1799
02:00:19.866 --> 02:00:23.576
Beanie. More. Yeah, yeah.

1800
02:00:23.661 --> 02:00:25.653
Go, go!

1801
02:00:50.897 --> 02:00:56.734
<i>♪ Ten thousand miles away from home ♪</i>

1802
02:00:57.737 --> 02:01:03.529
<i>♪ And I don't
even know my name ♪</i>

1803
02:01:19.008 --> 02:01:20.089
Marcia.

1804
02:01:21.219 --> 02:01:23.632
Oh, Marcia.

1805
02:01:25.265 --> 02:01:26.265
Yeah.

1806
02:01:27.725 --> 02:01:28.725
Marcia.

1807
02:01:30.186 --> 02:01:33.350
I knew you'd come. 
I knew you'd get here.

1808
02:01:34.107 --> 02:01:36.269
Listen, Marcia, I lost them.

1809
02:01:36.359 --> 02:01:38.726
But all I gotta do is talk with them
one more time.


1810
02:01:39.195 --> 02:01:43.530
Yeah, I'll tell them I just said that
to see how many is really listening.


1811
02:01:45.827 --> 02:01:49.821
Yeah. Sure, I'll have them eating out
of my hands again just like old times.


1812
02:01:49.914 --> 02:01:52.827
- Larry, it was me.
- Then I'm back on top again.


1813
02:01:52.917 --> 02:01:57.457
First thing I do when I'm back on top,
I'll get that sound man.


1814
02:01:57.547 --> 02:02:01.086
I'll get that dirty,
stinking little mechanical genius.


1815
02:02:01.175 --> 02:02:02.256
It was me.

1816
02:02:05.013 --> 02:02:06.094
Huh?

1817
02:02:07.640 --> 02:02:08.721
Huh?

1818
02:02:12.145 --> 02:02:13.181
It was.

1819
02:02:15.899 --> 02:02:16.980
It was me.

1820
02:02:19.777 --> 02:02:21.143
I held the key open.

1821
02:02:22.447 --> 02:02:23.654
On purpose.

1822
02:02:26.618 --> 02:02:28.860
I'm telling you this
so you'll never call me again.


1823
02:02:31.539 --> 02:02:32.700
Never again.

1824
02:02:34.167 --> 02:02:35.203
Okay.

1825
02:02:36.127 --> 02:02:37.413
Okay, Marcia.

1826
02:02:40.882 --> 02:02:42.373
My marshmallow.

1827
02:02:45.261 --> 02:02:46.468
Good luck.

1828
02:02:47.764 --> 02:02:48.925
Good luck with Mel.

1829
02:02:49.807 --> 02:02:51.014
Let me alone.

1830
02:02:59.317 --> 02:03:00.853
Larry, I'm sorry. Forgive me.

1831
02:03:01.861 --> 02:03:02.861
Go on.

1832
02:03:12.914 --> 02:03:16.749
Listen, I'm not through yet.
You know what's gonna happen to me?


1833
02:03:16.834 --> 02:03:19.747
Suppose I tell you exactly
what's gonna happen to you.


1834
02:03:21.881 --> 02:03:23.622
You're gonna be back in television.

1835
02:03:24.467 --> 02:03:26.880
Only it won't be quite the same
as it was before.


1836
02:03:27.512 --> 02:03:29.629
There'll be a reasonable
cooling-off period,


1837
02:03:29.722 --> 02:03:33.887
and somebody will say, "Why don't we
try him again in an inexpensive format?


1838
02:03:33.977 --> 02:03:36.060
People's memories aren't too long."

1839
02:03:37.188 --> 02:03:39.430
And you know, in
a way, he'll be right.

1840
02:03:39.524 --> 02:03:41.891
Some of the people will forget,
and some of them won't.


1841
02:03:42.735 --> 02:03:44.442
Oh, you'll have a show.

1842
02:03:44.529 --> 02:03:47.693
Maybe not the best hour
or, you know, top ten.


1843
02:03:47.782 --> 02:03:49.523
Maybe not even in the top 35.

1844
02:03:50.076 --> 02:03:51.567
But you'll have a show.

1845
02:03:52.370 --> 02:03:54.908
It just won't be quite the same
as it was before.


1846
02:03:55.665 --> 02:03:57.907
Then a couple of new fellas
will come along.


1847
02:03:58.001 --> 02:04:01.119
And pretty soon, a lot of your fans
will be flocking around them.


1848
02:04:01.796 --> 02:04:07.337
And then one day, somebody will ask,
"Whatever happened to... what's-his-name?


1849
02:04:07.427 --> 02:04:09.464
You know, the one who was so big.

1850
02:04:09.971 --> 02:04:12.384
The number-one fella
a couple of years ago.


1851
02:04:12.473 --> 02:04:15.432
He was famous.
How can we forget a name like that?


1852
02:04:15.518 --> 02:04:18.431
Oh, by the way,
have you seen, uh, Barry Mills?


1853
02:04:18.521 --> 02:04:21.889
I think he's the greatest thing
since Will Rogers."


1854
02:04:31.617 --> 02:04:32.983
Beanie!

1855
02:05:04.233 --> 02:05:06.691
- Marcia!
- Mel.


1856
02:05:07.820 --> 02:05:10.153
Don't leave me!

1857
02:05:13.618 --> 02:05:15.575
I don't figure him for a suicide.

1858
02:05:16.204 --> 02:05:18.366
Marcia!

1859
02:05:18.456 --> 02:05:20.539
Mel, if I'd only left him
in that jail in Pickett.


1860
02:05:20.625 --> 02:05:24.915
Marcia, stop it. You were taken in,
just like we were all taken in.


1861
02:05:26.130 --> 02:05:29.498
But we get wise to them,
and that's our strength.


1862
02:05:29.592 --> 02:05:33.427
- Come back, Marcia!
- We get wise to them.


1863
02:05:34.263 --> 02:05:36.880
Marcia!

1864
02:05:36.974 --> 02:05:39.216
Come back!

1865
02:05:41.771 --> 02:05:44.889
Don't leave me!

1866
02:05:45.817 --> 02:05:49.026
Don't leave me!

1867
02:05:49.904 --> 02:05:52.738
Don't leave me!

1868
02:05:54.075 --> 02:05:56.408
Marcia!

1869
02:05:56.494 --> 02:05:58.281
Don't leave me!

1870
02:05:59.622 --> 02:06:01.989
Come back!

1871
02:06:02.083 --> 02:06:04.245
Come back!

1872
02:06:04.836 --> 02:06:06.828
Come back!
