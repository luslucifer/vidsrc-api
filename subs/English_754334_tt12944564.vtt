00:10:10.041 --> 00:10:14.583
of more generously
applying the Jeffersonian idea


159
00:10:14.667 --> 00:10:16.833
that everybody gets a chance.

160
00:10:17.541 --> 00:10:18.999
Thomas Jefferson wrote,

161
00:10:19.083 --> 00:10:21.625
"We hold these truths
to be self-evident,


162
00:10:21.708 --> 00:10:24.833
that all men are created equal
and are endowed by their Creator


163
00:10:24.917 --> 00:10:28.249
with certain inalienable
rights, among them life, liberty,


164
00:10:28.333 --> 00:10:30.208
and the pursuit of happiness."

165
00:10:30.999 --> 00:10:33.333
Jefferson didn't mean everybody

166
00:10:33.416 --> 00:10:37.999
when he sat down to
write that in June of 1776.


167
00:10:38.083 --> 00:10:39.625
He didn't mean women.

168
00:10:39.708 --> 00:10:41.625
He didn't mean people of color.

169
00:10:41.708 --> 00:10:43.166
He meant white men.

170
00:10:44.750 --> 00:10:47.083
But the story of the country

171
00:10:47.166 --> 00:10:51.458
is one in which we have
more generously understood


172
00:10:51.541 --> 00:10:53.249
what that sentence meant.

173
00:10:54.541 --> 00:10:58.541
Where we were opening our
arms and not clenching our fists.

On Saturday, one day after
the presidential inauguration,

00:11:09.083 --> 00:11:12.500
thousands of women are expected

many in pink
knitted "pussyhats,"


179
00:11:16.166 --> 00:11:17.500
gathered in the National Mall.

180
00:11:17.583 --> 00:11:20.166
An estimated half a
million people turned out.


181
00:11:20.249 --> 00:11:22.267
I really believed that we were

182
00:11:22.291 --> 00:11:25.208
moving toward a world
where there was equality,


183
00:11:25.291 --> 00:11:29.875
and I guess I was really
disappointed that, um...


184
00:11:29.958 --> 00:11:32.208
the election showed that maybe,

185
00:11:32.291 --> 00:11:34.333
I don't know, maybe
there was a backlash.


186

For those who think that
the country can't change,


187
00:11:37.750 --> 00:11:41.458
I sometimes submit
that a hundred years ago,


188
00:11:41.541 --> 00:11:44.083
more than half the
population couldn't vote.


189
00:11:46.750 --> 00:11:50.041
To exclude women from
voting was to move them


190
00:11:50.124 --> 00:11:53.625
to second- or even
third-class citizenship.


191
00:11:53.708 --> 00:11:57.500
Our better angels tell us that
if all men are created equal,


192
00:11:57.583 --> 00:12:00.458
then all men and
women are created equal.


193

To make that real is a
victory for those better angels.

out of which the
suffrage movement arises


197
00:12:18.041 --> 00:12:19.792
really starts in the
antebellum period


198
00:12:19.875 --> 00:12:22.958
in the United States,
so in the 1830s, 1840s.


199

By 1913 or so, there's
this phenomenon

00:12:26.958 --> 00:12:28.333
called the "New Woman."

201

And the New Woman is this
young, independent woman

who works for a while,
forestalls marriage,

sometimes has a fair
degree of education.

And people hold up the
New Woman all the time


205
00:12:39.333 --> 00:12:40.333
to say, you know,

206
00:12:40.416 --> 00:12:42.249
"Woman has all the
rights she could need.

Why would she need the vote?"

208
00:12:44.792 --> 00:12:45.833
In the suffrage movement,

209
00:12:45.917 --> 00:12:48.291
the person who most
emblemized this New Woman


210
00:12:48.375 --> 00:12:49.875
was Alice Paul.

211
00:13:01.249 --> 00:13:02.750
She had gone to college.

212
00:13:02.833 --> 00:13:03.958
She was a social worker.

213
00:13:04.041 --> 00:13:05.958
She went to England.
And while she was there,


214
00:13:06.041 --> 00:13:08.999
she became associated
with the suffrage movement


215
00:13:09.083 --> 00:13:11.249
in Britain, which
was quite militant.


216
00:13:11.333 --> 00:13:13.208
And then she would
come back to the US,


217
00:13:13.291 --> 00:13:15.792
and launch a new chapter
of the suffrage movement


218
00:13:15.875 --> 00:13:19.416
that was in your
face and unrelenting.


219
00:13:29.291 --> 00:13:33.416
Alice Paul launched a
very direct campaign,


220
00:13:33.500 --> 00:13:35.917
focused on the White House,
trying to get Woodrow Wilson


221
00:13:35.999 --> 00:13:38.166
to endorse the
suffrage movement.


222
00:13:38.249 --> 00:13:42.333
When he arrived in Washington
in 1913 for his inauguration,


223
00:13:42.416 --> 00:13:45.124
he actually asked,
"Where are all the people?"


224
00:13:45.208 --> 00:13:47.917
And all the people were
at the suffrage march.


225
00:13:47.999 --> 00:13:49.792
There were floats
and delegations


226
00:13:49.875 --> 00:13:52.291
from suffragists all
around the nation.


227
00:13:52.375 --> 00:13:55.083
It's the largest parade
to take to the streets


228
00:13:55.166 --> 00:13:57.249
in American
history at that point.

But the crowd becomes incensed

230
00:14:00.750 --> 00:14:01.667
because, of course,

231
00:14:01.750 --> 00:14:03.500
good, respectable
women don't do this,


232
00:14:03.583 --> 00:14:06.416
and the crowd starts
attacking the marchers.

If you're a white man

appeal of the Klan


235
00:14:12.999 --> 00:14:15.583
in the second decade
of the 20th century,


236
00:14:15.667 --> 00:14:18.166
"My God, immigrants
are taking my job.

Catholics are trying
to change my culture.

And now women want
to vote. What's next?"


239
00:14:23.792 --> 00:14:26.583
You know, that was the view.

240
00:14:26.667 --> 00:14:28.541
People are sent to the hospital,

241
00:14:28.625 --> 00:14:30.249
people have broken bones.

And the police turn a blind eye.

243

But Alice Paul keeps up
this tactic of direct action.


244
00:14:44.291 --> 00:14:48.249
One of the things she does
is start stationing picketers

silently outside the
White House gates.


250

We now think of this
as a familiar tactic.

That was brand new.

252
00:15:14.375 --> 00:15:17.500
Alice Paul made a
point of having people


253
00:15:17.583 --> 00:15:18.999
at every gate of
the White House,


254

so that the president
would have to see them

She was determined to
take the fight directly to him.


257
00:15:28.333 --> 00:15:30.625
At first, Woodrow Wilson is

258
00:15:30.708 --> 00:15:32.124
cheerfully tolerant of them.

259
00:15:32.208 --> 00:15:35.458
"Oh, these cute little women,
they'll go away after a while."


260
00:15:35.541 --> 00:15:37.458
And then winter comes,
and they're still there.


261
00:15:37.541 --> 00:15:39.667
And then summer comes,
and they're still there.


262
00:15:39.750 --> 00:15:41.875
And then World War I breaks out.

263
00:15:41.958 --> 00:15:44.375
And you do not picket
a wartime president.


264
00:15:44.458 --> 00:15:46.124
That is unpatriotic.

265
00:16:01.249 --> 00:16:04.416
The problem is that they
are not breaking any laws,


266
00:16:04.500 --> 00:16:06.792
so they trump up a
reason to arrest them,


267
00:16:06.875 --> 00:16:08.999
and they say that they
have obstructed traffic.


268
00:16:09.083 --> 00:16:10.625
And they start to
round up these women,


269
00:16:10.708 --> 00:16:13.792
throw them into paddy wagons,
and assume they'll go away.


270
00:16:13.875 --> 00:16:16.416
They go to court, they
refuse to pay their court fines,


271
00:16:16.500 --> 00:16:17.917
they go to the workhouse.

They go to the workhouse.

00:16:21.875 --> 00:16:23.291
So you start to have a huge crop

276
00:16:23.375 --> 00:16:26.208
of political prisoners in
Occoquan Workhouse.


277
00:16:37.375 --> 00:16:39.792
There were hunger
strikes in prison.


278
00:16:39.875 --> 00:16:41.750
They were willing
to risk everything.


279
00:16:43.124 --> 00:16:44.726
The prison staff
thought they could


280
00:16:44.750 --> 00:16:45.917
stop this hunger strike

281
00:16:45.999 --> 00:16:47.833
by force-feeding these women.

282
00:16:47.917 --> 00:16:51.583
They would put them in
chairs and literally strap them in.


283
00:16:52.375 --> 00:16:53.999
And then you would have a tube

284
00:16:54.083 --> 00:16:57.124
forced down your throat.

285
00:16:57.208 --> 00:16:58.726
And then they would put a funnel

286
00:16:58.750 --> 00:16:59.958
at the top of the tube,

287
00:17:00.041 --> 00:17:01.559
and they would whip up
eggs or whatever it might be,


288
00:17:01.583 --> 00:17:03.392
and then they would
just pour it into the funnel


289
00:17:03.416 --> 00:17:04.500
and it would come down.

290
00:17:04.583 --> 00:17:05.583
The women would vomit.

291
00:17:05.625 --> 00:17:07.416
They had bloody noses routinely.

292
00:17:12.500 --> 00:17:14.100
Alice Paul had stomach problems

293
00:17:14.124 --> 00:17:15.583
for the rest of her life.

294
00:17:16.333 --> 00:17:17.833
But the National Woman's Party

295
00:17:17.917 --> 00:17:19.476
knows what's going on
inside the prison, right,


296
00:17:19.500 --> 00:17:21.249
and they start publicizing
what's happening.


297
00:17:26.375 --> 00:17:28.309
And this creates a
great deal of sympathy


298
00:17:28.333 --> 00:17:32.208
in the American public
because it was so brutal.


299
00:17:32.291 --> 00:17:35.041
But really it's a
million things over time


300
00:17:35.124 --> 00:17:37.667
that eventually tip the scales.

301
00:17:37.750 --> 00:17:40.208
A bunch of suffragists
go state by state


302
00:17:40.291 --> 00:17:42.583
and get "male" taken
out of the constitution.


303
00:17:42.667 --> 00:17:44.041
That is a dual strategy

304
00:17:44.124 --> 00:17:46.184
working at the state level
and working at the federal level.


305
00:17:46.208 --> 00:17:48.124
You've got two branches
of the movement.


306
00:17:51.458 --> 00:17:52.625
The state movement

307
00:17:52.708 --> 00:17:54.291
starts to win a
lot of victories.


308
00:17:54.375 --> 00:17:56.708
States out west and
states in other places


309
00:17:56.792 --> 00:17:58.083
start enfranchising women

310
00:17:58.166 --> 00:17:59.999
and allowing them
access to the ballot.


311
00:18:01.291 --> 00:18:05.583
It started to have a kind of
insurmountable momentum to it


312
00:18:05.667 --> 00:18:07.625
that I think Wilson
eventually joined.


313
00:18:21.416 --> 00:18:24.249
In 1918, Congress
takes up a vote,


314
00:18:24.333 --> 00:18:26.625
and it narrowly fails.

315
00:18:26.708 --> 00:18:28.416
And what the National
Woman's Party decide


316
00:18:28.500 --> 00:18:30.166
is they're gonna
go to those states,


317
00:18:30.249 --> 00:18:31.917
to those legislators
who voted against,


318
00:18:31.999 --> 00:18:33.999
and they're gonna try
to get them out of office.


319
00:18:34.917 --> 00:18:36.083
And by 1919,

320
00:18:36.166 --> 00:18:38.999
they've gotten a lot of
those men out of office.


321
00:18:39.083 --> 00:18:41.625
They take a second vote in
the House and the Senate,


322
00:18:41.708 --> 00:18:43.291
and it passes both.

323
00:18:48.166 --> 00:18:49.958
Change in America comes

324
00:18:50.041 --> 00:18:52.166
when the powerful take notice

325
00:18:52.249 --> 00:18:54.999
of what the people
have been saying.


326
00:19:00.291 --> 00:19:02.333
And when those
two things intersect,


327
00:19:02.416 --> 00:19:04.166
that's how history is made.

328
00:19:05.041 --> 00:19:07.541
♪

329
00:19:14.041 --> 00:19:15.875
But the thing that
we can't forget


330
00:19:15.958 --> 00:19:19.333
is that while this
suffrage story is unfolding,


331
00:19:19.416 --> 00:19:22.208
there is simultaneously a
suppression of democracy


332
00:19:22.291 --> 00:19:23.875
going on in the United States.

333
00:19:28.625 --> 00:19:31.500
During that massive

334
00:19:31.583 --> 00:19:33.917
the great Ida B.
Wells, journalist,


335
00:19:33.999 --> 00:19:36.375
anti-lynching crusader,
feminist activist,


336
00:19:36.458 --> 00:19:39.667
comes in with her Illinois
delegation from Chicago.


337
00:19:39.750 --> 00:19:42.166
But they're in D.C.,
which is a southern city,


338
00:19:42.249 --> 00:19:44.601
and there are gonna be southern
congresspeople watching this.


339
00:19:44.625 --> 00:19:45.833
And so Alice Paul says,

340
00:19:45.917 --> 00:19:48.416
"No, we can't have you
march with white women."


341
00:19:48.500 --> 00:19:50.166
And that's one
example of the ways


342
00:19:50.249 --> 00:19:52.416
in which Alice Paul
was willing to embrace


343
00:19:52.500 --> 00:19:55.375
and perpetuate racism in
the service of the movement.


344
00:19:55.458 --> 00:19:57.625
And I think the suffrage
movement reminds us


345
00:19:57.708 --> 00:19:59.583
that we really have to
be thinking constantly


346
00:19:59.667 --> 00:20:02.999
about the ways in which justice
movements can do damage


347
00:20:03.083 --> 00:20:04.999
while they're also doing good.

348
00:20:05.083 --> 00:20:06.999
And I think that's a
caution to us today


349
00:20:07.083 --> 00:20:08.375
because we're no different.

350
00:20:23.458 --> 00:20:25.291
I grew up on Missionary Ridge,

351
00:20:25.375 --> 00:20:27.999
a battlefield in
Chattanooga, Tennessee.


352
00:20:32.958 --> 00:20:36.375
When I was little, you could
still find Civil War bullets


353
00:20:36.458 --> 00:20:38.667
on Missionary Ridge and around.

354
00:20:38.750 --> 00:20:42.083
So, to me, the history
was just right there.


355
00:20:45.625 --> 00:20:48.208
I met Jon when he was 19,

356
00:20:48.291 --> 00:20:52.166
and he seemed to me like
he was 30 when I met him.


357
00:20:52.249 --> 00:20:54.416
He was just very
much an old soul,


358
00:20:54.500 --> 00:20:56.041
and he was very wise.

359
00:20:56.124 --> 00:20:58.500
He was sort of someone
who got on really well


360
00:20:58.583 --> 00:21:00.208
with older people.

361
00:21:00.291 --> 00:21:01.917
You could tell that
this was someone


362
00:21:01.999 --> 00:21:05.124
who, at a very young
age, was really engaged


363
00:21:05.208 --> 00:21:07.041
in the life of the mind.

364
00:21:08.833 --> 00:21:12.958
At age ten, he
campaigned for Reagan.


365
00:21:13.041 --> 00:21:16.291
And he was fascinated
by Reagan as a man.


366
00:21:16.375 --> 00:21:18.291
We, as Americans,

367
00:21:18.375 --> 00:21:22.083
have the capacity now,
as we've had in the past,


368
00:21:22.166 --> 00:21:25.041
to do whatever needs to be done

369
00:21:25.124 --> 00:21:29.041
to preserve this last and
greatest bastion of freedom.


370
00:21:29.124 --> 00:21:31.875
I could have fairly
easily ended up


371
00:21:31.958 --> 00:21:35.792
in some sort of young
conservative ethos.


372
00:21:35.875 --> 00:21:40.416
But because I started in
journalism when I was 18


373
00:21:40.500 --> 00:21:44.333
at the Chattanooga Times,
I almost immediately saw


374
00:21:44.416 --> 00:21:46.833
that the world was a hell
of a lot more complicated


375
00:21:46.917 --> 00:21:49.375
than either a
conservative ideology


376
00:21:49.458 --> 00:21:51.583
or a liberal ideology
would have it.


377
00:21:53.875 --> 00:21:55.958
By the time we
really got together,


378
00:21:56.041 --> 00:21:57.833
he was at the
Washington Monthly,


379
00:21:57.917 --> 00:22:01.124
which was like boot
camp for journalism.


380
00:22:01.208 --> 00:22:03.833
We would have Friday
night dates that got cancelled


381
00:22:03.917 --> 00:22:06.166
because we had to
drive up to the printer


382
00:22:06.249 --> 00:22:08.750
because somebody
was late filing their stories.


383
00:22:09.999 --> 00:22:13.458
And then Jon ended up
getting an offer from Newsweek.


384
00:22:13.541 --> 00:22:16.083
I was an editor at Newsweek,

385
00:22:16.166 --> 00:22:19.166
and the young Jon
Meacham walked in,


386
00:22:19.249 --> 00:22:20.792
25 years old, maybe.

387
00:22:20.875 --> 00:22:23.833
We talked for a little bit,
and I realized right away


388
00:22:23.917 --> 00:22:26.166
that I'd be working
for him soon.


389
00:22:26.249 --> 00:22:27.333
You are how old?

390
00:22:27.416 --> 00:22:29.166
- I'm 29.
- Twenty-nine?


391
00:22:29.249 --> 00:22:31.500
What's it like to be a

392
00:22:31.583 --> 00:22:33.458
- Closing in on 30.
- Okay.


393
00:22:33.541 --> 00:22:35.708
What's it like to be a,
uh, closing-in-on-30,


394
00:22:35.792 --> 00:22:38.750
uh, managing editor of, uh,
one of the big news magazines?


395
00:22:38.833 --> 00:22:42.041
My guest tonight, the editor
of Newsweek magazine.


396
00:22:42.124 --> 00:22:44.833
Please welcome back to
the show, Jon Meacham. Jon?


397
00:22:46.416 --> 00:22:47.643
I remember thinking

398
00:22:47.667 --> 00:22:49.166
he was a slightly
ridiculous figure


399
00:22:49.249 --> 00:22:52.541
at Newsweek because
people usually dress sloppily,


400
00:22:52.625 --> 00:22:56.166
and Meacham always
wore kind of a neat suit.


401
00:22:56.249 --> 00:22:58.166
His hair was carefully combed.

402
00:22:58.249 --> 00:23:01.375
He had this slight waddle
as he went down the hallway.


403
00:23:01.458 --> 00:23:04.541
He was kind of prematurely
old and... an old-fashioned figure


404
00:23:04.625 --> 00:23:06.541
surrounded by a lot of
people trying to be hip.


405
00:23:06.625 --> 00:23:08.291
And I think he took
some grief for it.


406
00:23:08.375 --> 00:23:10.833
I think people kind of
laughed at it a little bit.


407
00:23:10.917 --> 00:23:12.958
But they weren't laughing
when he was working on...


408
00:23:13.041 --> 00:23:14.667
When he was
working on their copy.


409
00:23:17.375 --> 00:23:19.017
You know, I've
written about people


410
00:23:19.041 --> 00:23:20.583
about whom much
has been written.


411
00:23:20.667 --> 00:23:22.541
Thomas Jefferson,
Andrew Jackson.


412
00:23:22.625 --> 00:23:23.917
And I've written about people

413
00:23:23.999 --> 00:23:25.100
where it's kind of the beginning

414
00:23:25.124 --> 00:23:27.458
of the conversation,
George H. W. Bush.


415
00:23:30.291 --> 00:23:33.541
On the primary campaign
trail in New Hampshire once,


416
00:23:33.625 --> 00:23:36.375
he grabbed the hand of a
department store mannequin,


417
00:23:36.458 --> 00:23:37.999
asking for votes.

418
00:23:40.124 --> 00:23:43.291
When he realized
his mistake, he said,


419
00:23:43.375 --> 00:23:45.291
"Never know, gotta ask."

420
00:23:49.124 --> 00:23:51.750
I've spent most of my life...

421
00:23:51.833 --> 00:23:53.958
thinking about the past,

422
00:23:54.041 --> 00:23:59.833
and thinking about how
the past became something


423
00:23:59.917 --> 00:24:03.875
either worth emulating
or worth avoiding.


424
00:24:05.458 --> 00:24:09.333
♪

425
00:24:16.833 --> 00:24:19.291
In the course of
a year, I can do


426
00:24:19.375 --> 00:24:22.708
between sixty and a hundred
speaking engagements...


427
00:24:23.667 --> 00:24:26.500
with people who
care about the country,


428
00:24:26.583 --> 00:24:27.750
who care about history,

429
00:24:27.833 --> 00:24:30.208
and are trying to
connect these dots.


430
00:24:35.999 --> 00:24:39.291
So, one sign of consistency
in challenging times


431
00:24:39.375 --> 00:24:41.625
is I appear to be
wearing the same necktie.


432
00:24:43.875 --> 00:24:44.999
So...

433
00:24:45.999 --> 00:24:47.625
My hair is grayer, however,

434
00:24:47.708 --> 00:24:50.291
so that may be because
of the 2016 election.


435
00:24:50.375 --> 00:24:55.500
Uh, so 2016, uh,
how did it happen?


436
00:24:55.583 --> 00:24:56.917
Two numbers, I think.

437
00:24:58.667 --> 00:25:01.041
One is 17 percent.

438
00:25:01.124 --> 00:25:03.208
That's the percentage
of Americans who say


439
00:25:03.291 --> 00:25:04.958
they have trust in the
federal government


440
00:25:05.041 --> 00:25:07.583
to do the right thing
some or most of the time.


441
00:25:08.792 --> 00:25:12.750
That's down from 77
percent in the mid-1960s.


442
00:25:12.833 --> 00:25:15.416
So that's a huge trust gap.

443
00:25:16.124 --> 00:25:18.708
The other is $130,000.

444
00:25:18.792 --> 00:25:21.458
That's the number that
some economists believe


445
00:25:21.541 --> 00:25:24.750
a family of four needs in
annual household income


446
00:25:24.833 --> 00:25:26.999
to lead what they would think of

447
00:25:27.083 --> 00:25:29.667
as a classic post-World
War II middle-class life.


448
00:25:29.750 --> 00:25:31.667
Annual income
for a family of four


449
00:25:31.750 --> 00:25:33.958
is about 56,000
dollars right now.


450
00:25:34.041 --> 00:25:37.958
So in that missing income
gap and in that trust gap,


451
00:25:38.041 --> 00:25:39.792
you have the ingredients

452
00:25:39.875 --> 00:25:42.958
for a kind of populist
moment like this...


453
00:25:44.458 --> 00:25:47.833
where someone says,
"Those people are to blame


454
00:25:47.917 --> 00:25:50.124
for the fact that you
don't have this money."


455
00:25:50.208 --> 00:25:54.166
We are sick and tired
of people disrespecting,


456
00:25:54.249 --> 00:25:56.166
coming over by the thousands.

457
00:25:56.249 --> 00:25:58.750
We wanna make sure
that our borders are secure.


458
00:26:00.041 --> 00:26:01.750
The US government is releasing

459
00:26:01.833 --> 00:26:04.333
new video of the
child detention centers.


460
00:26:04.416 --> 00:26:06.375
This shows children walled in

461
00:26:06.458 --> 00:26:07.875
by a chain-link fence.

462
00:26:07.958 --> 00:26:10.541
Mommy.

463
00:26:13.708 --> 00:26:17.124
And so often, people
in American history


464
00:26:17.208 --> 00:26:19.708
have felt that they
were on a precipice,


465
00:26:19.792 --> 00:26:22.124
- and so they lash out.

623
00:35:13.833 --> 00:35:15.416
particularly along
the West Coast,


624
00:35:15.500 --> 00:35:19.249
that Japanese Americans
might serve as agents


625
00:35:19.333 --> 00:35:21.708
of the Japanese
imperial government,


626
00:35:21.792 --> 00:35:23.416
an enemy force.

627
00:35:23.500 --> 00:35:25.917
Word has just come
that some 91 Japanese


628
00:35:25.999 --> 00:35:28.291
have been taken into
custody in Northern California


629
00:35:28.375 --> 00:35:29.833
by the FBI.

630
00:35:29.917 --> 00:35:32.917
In Fresno, California, two
Japanese were arrested,


631
00:35:32.999 --> 00:35:34.958
their automobile
seized by police.


632
00:35:35.041 --> 00:35:38.958
Within a day, the
Secret Service, the FBI


633
00:35:39.041 --> 00:35:42.083
sweeps into cities
and urban areas


634
00:35:42.166 --> 00:35:44.375
from Seattle to Arizona,

635
00:35:44.458 --> 00:35:48.500
arresting community
leaders, martial arts instructors,


636
00:35:48.583 --> 00:35:51.500
Japanese school language
teachers, Buddhist priests.


637
00:35:51.583 --> 00:35:53.291
Our West Coast became

638
00:35:53.375 --> 00:35:56.041
a potential combat zone.

639
00:35:56.124 --> 00:35:58.750
Living in that zone were
more than 100,000 persons


640
00:35:58.833 --> 00:36:00.208
of Japanese ancestry,

641
00:36:00.291 --> 00:36:02.458
two thirds of them
American citizens,


642
00:36:02.541 --> 00:36:04.500
one third aliens.

643
00:36:04.583 --> 00:36:06.999
My parents met in Los Angeles

644
00:36:07.083 --> 00:36:09.124
and they married there.

645
00:36:09.208 --> 00:36:14.249
I turned five years
old on April 20th, 1942.


646
00:36:14.333 --> 00:36:18.500
I'm the oldest, and my brother
was next, a year younger,


647
00:36:18.583 --> 00:36:21.249
and my baby sister, Nancy.

648
00:36:21.333 --> 00:36:23.958
Here we were in
the United States,


649
00:36:24.041 --> 00:36:28.416
and the country was at
war with our ancestral land,


650
00:36:28.500 --> 00:36:33.792
and so there was great concern
about what might happen to us.


651
00:36:33.875 --> 00:36:36.083
♪

652
00:36:39.416 --> 00:36:41.667
The Attorney General
of California, Earl Warren,


653
00:36:41.750 --> 00:36:46.291
and others argued that
people of foreign descent


654
00:36:46.375 --> 00:36:49.875
were dangerous, were
potentially enemies of the country.


655
00:36:49.958 --> 00:36:51.750
No one knew what would happen

656
00:36:51.833 --> 00:36:53.792
among this
concentrated population


657
00:36:53.875 --> 00:36:56.792
if Japanese forces
should invade our shores.


658
00:36:57.500 --> 00:36:59.833
By February 1942,

659
00:36:59.917 --> 00:37:04.208
President Roosevelt
signs Executive Order 9066,


660
00:37:04.291 --> 00:37:08.041
and this empowered
the military to take control


661
00:37:08.124 --> 00:37:10.416
of the eight most
western states.


662
00:37:12.541 --> 00:37:14.792
General DeWitt is
placed in command


663
00:37:14.875 --> 00:37:17.375
of that whole western region.

664
00:37:17.458 --> 00:37:20.541
General DeWitt, uh, said
that Japanese Americans


665
00:37:20.625 --> 00:37:21.958
are an enemy race.

666
00:37:22.041 --> 00:37:25.500
He said very emphatically,
"A Jap's a Jap.


667
00:37:25.583 --> 00:37:28.124
And a scrap of paper
attesting to his citizenship


668
00:37:28.208 --> 00:37:29.833
doesn't alter that fact."

669
00:37:29.917 --> 00:37:32.333
He began issuing
public proclamations


670
00:37:32.416 --> 00:37:34.833
singling out Japanese Americans.

671
00:37:37.458 --> 00:37:38.750
A curfew came down.

672
00:37:38.833 --> 00:37:41.792
Japanese Americans had
to be home by eight o'clock


673
00:37:41.875 --> 00:37:46.208
and stay home until

674
00:37:46.291 --> 00:37:48.833
The government
froze our bank account.


675
00:37:48.917 --> 00:37:51.583
Rents couldn't be paid.

676
00:37:51.667 --> 00:37:55.917
My father's dry cleaning
business fell apart.


677
00:37:55.999 --> 00:37:58.708
Everything was lost. Everything.

678
00:38:02.500 --> 00:38:04.999
And then the soldiers came.

679
00:38:08.875 --> 00:38:12.917
One morning, my parents
got me up very early,


680
00:38:12.999 --> 00:38:16.583
together with my brother
and my baby sister,


681
00:38:16.667 --> 00:38:19.083
and dressed us, uh, hurriedly.

682
00:38:20.999 --> 00:38:23.875
And suddenly, we
saw two soldiers


683
00:38:23.958 --> 00:38:25.708
marching up our driveway,

684
00:38:25.792 --> 00:38:29.249
carrying rifles with
shiny bayonets.


685
00:38:30.333 --> 00:38:32.458
And they stomped
onto the front porch


686
00:38:32.541 --> 00:38:33.833
and with their fists,

687
00:38:33.917 --> 00:38:37.166
began pounding on the door.

688
00:38:37.249 --> 00:38:41.541
Uh, that sound still
resonates in my mind.


689
00:38:43.416 --> 00:38:45.792
My father came out,
answered the door,


690
00:38:45.875 --> 00:38:48.500
and we were ordered
out of our home.


691
00:38:50.458 --> 00:38:52.041
We stood on the driveway

692
00:38:52.124 --> 00:38:54.958
waiting for our
mother to come out.


693
00:38:55.041 --> 00:38:56.333
And when she came out,

694
00:38:56.416 --> 00:38:58.958
she had our baby
sister in one arm,


695
00:38:59.041 --> 00:39:03.166
a huge, heavy-looking
duffel bag in the other,


696
00:39:03.249 --> 00:39:06.917
and tears were streaming
down her cheeks.


697
00:39:10.917 --> 00:39:13.291
♪

698
00:39:21.333 --> 00:39:23.917
We were taken by truck

699
00:39:23.999 --> 00:39:26.124
to, uh, the, uh, 
Buddhist temple

700
00:39:26.208 --> 00:39:29.249
in downtown Los
Angeles in Little Tokyo.


701
00:39:31.583 --> 00:39:34.583
And that's where we
were all assembled.


702
00:39:35.667 --> 00:39:37.500
The heads of the families

703
00:39:37.583 --> 00:39:39.583
were ordered to report,

704
00:39:39.667 --> 00:39:43.833
and we were given our
family number and tag.


705
00:39:58.917 --> 00:40:02.999
And a row of buses
took us to Santa Anita,


706
00:40:03.083 --> 00:40:04.541
where we were unloaded

707
00:40:04.625 --> 00:40:06.875
and herded over
to the stable areas,


708
00:40:06.958 --> 00:40:12.291
and each family was assigned
a horse stall to sleep in...


709
00:40:14.917 --> 00:40:18.667
still pungent with the
stink of horse manure.


710
00:40:24.583 --> 00:40:27.458
We were there about
three or four months...


711
00:40:30.792 --> 00:40:33.416
And then we were
loaded onto trains


712
00:40:33.500 --> 00:40:37.999
with armed soldiers at
both ends of each car.


713
00:40:49.249 --> 00:40:52.792
We were transported two thirds
of the way across the country


714
00:40:52.875 --> 00:40:55.124
to the swamps of Arkansas.

715
00:40:57.249 --> 00:40:59.416
There were ten camps altogether.

716
00:40:59.500 --> 00:41:02.833
Rohwer, Arkansas,
was the farthest east.


717
00:41:04.249 --> 00:41:07.041
The camps were not
camps, they were prisons.


718
00:41:08.708 --> 00:41:10.708
They lived in dusty barracks.

719
00:41:10.792 --> 00:41:12.541
There were cracks in the walls,

720
00:41:12.625 --> 00:41:14.375
so they had to
stuff newspaper in


721
00:41:14.458 --> 00:41:16.333
to stop the wind
from blowing in.


722
00:41:17.208 --> 00:41:19.917
They had common
latrines without doors.


723
00:41:19.999 --> 00:41:23.208
The food was terrible,
inadequate medical care.


724
00:41:25.166 --> 00:41:26.541
I did go to school,

725
00:41:26.625 --> 00:41:29.625
and I remember we
began every school day


726
00:41:29.708 --> 00:41:32.958
with the Pledge of
Allegiance to the Flag.


727
00:41:33.041 --> 00:41:35.792
I could see the barbed wire
fence and the sentry tower


728
00:41:35.875 --> 00:41:38.291
right outside my
schoolhouse window


729
00:41:38.375 --> 00:41:40.124
as I recited the words,

730
00:41:40.208 --> 00:41:43.958
"With liberty and
justice for all."


731
00:41:47.875 --> 00:41:49.667
By the end of 1942,

732
00:41:49.750 --> 00:41:53.124
you had almost

733
00:41:53.208 --> 00:41:55.041
people like my
mother and my father


734
00:41:55.124 --> 00:41:59.208
who were born in California,
who are citizens by birth,


735
00:41:59.291 --> 00:42:02.583
who had lost their property,
they lost their freedom,


736
00:42:02.667 --> 00:42:05.041
some had even lost their lives

737
00:42:05.124 --> 00:42:07.667
without any trial,
without any charges,


738
00:42:07.750 --> 00:42:09.291
and for no offense.

739
00:42:14.541 --> 00:42:17.416
We were incarcerated
for the duration of the war,


740
00:42:18.208 --> 00:42:19.416
four years.

741
00:42:21.583 --> 00:42:24.583
When we were
freed, we had nothing.


742
00:42:24.667 --> 00:42:26.041
For my parents,

743
00:42:26.124 --> 00:42:29.291
everything that they had
worked for was taken away.


744
00:42:33.208 --> 00:42:36.375
We know now that
if we lose this war,


745
00:42:36.458 --> 00:42:39.375
it will be generations
or even centuries


746
00:42:39.458 --> 00:42:43.667
before our conception of
democracy can live again.


747
00:42:45.083 --> 00:42:48.333
It's one of our most
shameful episodes.


748
00:42:48.416 --> 00:42:51.541
And a reminder
that even in the midst


749
00:42:51.625 --> 00:42:55.541
of a global campaign
to defend liberty,


750
00:42:55.625 --> 00:42:59.500
someone as otherwise
remarkable as Franklin Roosevelt


751
00:42:59.583 --> 00:43:02.625
was able to make a
decision that violated


752
00:43:02.708 --> 00:43:06.667
fundamental principles of both
human and American rights.


753
00:43:11.541 --> 00:43:13.999
The internment's
a cautionary tale.


754
00:43:15.166 --> 00:43:17.708
When we give in
to the worst in us,


755
00:43:18.750 --> 00:43:22.833
we exclude, we
oppress, we marginalize.


756
00:43:24.667 --> 00:43:26.958
Are we gonna look back
at the child separation


757
00:43:27.041 --> 00:43:29.291
on the southern border in
the same way we look back


758
00:43:29.375 --> 00:43:33.750
on slavery and segregation and
Japanese American internment?


759
00:43:33.833 --> 00:43:35.500
I'd bet yes.

I didn't wanna disturb you.

All the youngsters

Excellent.

772
00:44:29.375 --> 00:44:31.833
The other day when
you were on MSNBC,


773
00:44:31.917 --> 00:44:35.875
you were talking about
Trump being so emotional


774
00:44:35.958 --> 00:44:38.500
and the Democrats sort
of trying to talk reason.


775
00:44:38.583 --> 00:44:40.667
- Right.
- It was such a simple...


776
00:44:40.750 --> 00:44:42.225
- Reason versus passion.
- Yeah,


777
00:44:42.249 --> 00:44:45.249
such a simple statement
that you don't hear that.


778
00:44:45.333 --> 00:44:48.833
- I specialize in those.
- You don't hear those.


779
00:44:48.917 --> 00:44:50.833
I try to be as
simpleminded as possible.


780
00:44:50.917 --> 00:44:53.416
- It was so wonderful.
- Well, thank you.


781
00:44:58.416 --> 00:44:59.500
As Madison said,

782
00:44:59.583 --> 00:45:02.416
"Ambition must be made
to counteract ambition."


783
00:45:03.333 --> 00:45:05.999
And reason was our best bet.

784
00:45:06.083 --> 00:45:10.500
That insight forms the core
of what made this country


785
00:45:10.583 --> 00:45:13.375
and what makes this
country, when we get it right,


786
00:45:13.458 --> 00:45:14.625
truly great.

787
00:45:20.958 --> 00:45:24.124
Shh. I like this, shh.

788
00:45:24.208 --> 00:45:25.625
Hey, how are y'all?

789
00:45:25.708 --> 00:45:27.267
- Hey, how are you?
- Jon Meacham, how are you?


790
00:45:27.291 --> 00:45:29.331
- Hey, I'm Keith.
- Keith, glad to see you.


791
00:45:30.124 --> 00:45:31.875
Do we need a mic,
or are we okay?


792
00:45:31.958 --> 00:45:33.249
We're gonna mic you up.

793
00:45:35.667 --> 00:45:36.934
So, just be careful
when you get up.


794
00:45:36.958 --> 00:45:39.078
I have this microphone up top.

795
00:45:39.375 --> 00:45:41.041
Okay.

796
00:45:41.124 --> 00:45:42.833
We're at a moment in our history

797
00:45:42.917 --> 00:45:47.875
where we react to things
because of where we stand,


798
00:45:47.958 --> 00:45:49.875
not because of what they are.

799
00:45:49.958 --> 00:45:54.291
And the issue becomes
that the partisan reactions,


800
00:45:54.375 --> 00:45:57.917
the passionate
reactions to incoming data


801
00:45:57.999 --> 00:46:01.083
are so strong,
they're tsunami-like,


802
00:46:01.166 --> 00:46:05.667
that it's almost impossible
for people to sort out


803
00:46:05.750 --> 00:46:08.833
in a reasonable way,
in a data-driven way,


804
00:46:08.917 --> 00:46:11.249
what to make of a given report.

805
00:46:11.333 --> 00:46:13.833
One of the most significant
shifts we've lived through


806
00:46:13.917 --> 00:46:18.458
is the move from a
literate, reading print culture,


807
00:46:18.541 --> 00:46:21.083
which was the world
of Jefferson and Lincoln,


808
00:46:21.166 --> 00:46:23.625
to radio, which was
FDR and Churchill,


809
00:46:23.708 --> 00:46:26.041
to television, which was
Kennedy and Reagan,


810
00:46:26.124 --> 00:46:29.750
and now digital and
cable, which is Trump.


811
00:46:29.833 --> 00:46:31.750
It is increasing the likelihood

812
00:46:31.833 --> 00:46:35.249
that people will not
engage with texts,


813
00:46:35.333 --> 00:46:37.792
they will simply
engage emotionally.


814
00:46:37.875 --> 00:46:40.291
And that creates a
political marketplace


815
00:46:40.375 --> 00:46:45.958
that is ever farther from reason
and ever closer to passion,


816
00:46:46.041 --> 00:46:49.541
which is exactly what the
Founders were worried about.


817
00:46:50.792 --> 00:46:53.875
We can learn a lot by
studying the McCarthy era.


818
00:46:53.958 --> 00:46:55.291
I think the fall of McCarthy

819
00:46:55.375 --> 00:46:57.375
is an incredibly
important case study


820
00:46:57.458 --> 00:47:01.541
in how reason can ultimately
triumph over passion.


821
00:47:05.416 --> 00:47:08.667
Socialism has spread the
shadow of human regimentation


822
00:47:08.750 --> 00:47:11.249
over most of the
nations of the earth,


823
00:47:11.333 --> 00:47:15.792
and the shadow is encroaching
upon our own liberty.


824
00:47:15.875 --> 00:47:18.667
In many ways, the
conservative movement


825
00:47:18.750 --> 00:47:21.458
that has a connection
with conspiracy theories


826
00:47:21.541 --> 00:47:24.541
begins in the aftermath
of the second World War.


827
00:47:26.667 --> 00:47:28.875
The Communist fifth
columnists among us


828
00:47:28.958 --> 00:47:31.208
are working for
world dictatorship.


829
00:47:31.291 --> 00:47:33.708
There was anxiety about the way,

830
00:47:33.792 --> 00:47:36.083
uh, FDR had handled Yalta.

831
00:47:36.166 --> 00:47:39.041
Eisenhower was seen
as a dedicated agent


832
00:47:39.124 --> 00:47:41.708
of the Communist conspiracy.

833
00:47:41.792 --> 00:47:43.958
George Marshall,
the army chief of staff


834
00:47:44.041 --> 00:47:47.083
during World War II, was
seen as a Communist agent.


835
00:47:47.166 --> 00:47:49.667
Thousands of good, loyal
Americans have been duped


836
00:47:49.750 --> 00:47:52.333
into actually aiding
the Communists.


837
00:47:52.416 --> 00:47:55.917
There was this ferment
which plays in, yet again,


838
00:47:55.999 --> 00:48:00.750
to this recurring theme
that there is some force,


839
00:48:00.833 --> 00:48:03.999
foreigners, powerful
people, rich people,


840
00:48:04.083 --> 00:48:06.833
who are trying to
undo the America


841
00:48:06.917 --> 00:48:09.249
that is most familiar
and most beloved


842
00:48:09.333 --> 00:48:12.249
to those who are listening
to the conspiracy theories.


843
00:48:13.333 --> 00:48:14.833
Joseph R. McCarthy,

844
00:48:14.917 --> 00:48:16.792
the junior senator
from Wisconsin.


845
00:48:16.875 --> 00:48:18.375
He was obscure in the halls

846
00:48:18.458 --> 00:48:20.124
where senators
advise and consent


847
00:48:20.208 --> 00:48:22.333
until February the 9th, 1950.

848
00:48:22.416 --> 00:48:24.208
Even if there were
only one Communist


849
00:48:24.291 --> 00:48:26.166
in the State Department,
that would still be


850
00:48:26.249 --> 00:48:27.999
one Communist too many.

851
00:48:28.083 --> 00:48:29.625
Joe McCarthy gives a speech

852
00:48:29.708 --> 00:48:30.917
saying he has the names

853
00:48:30.999 --> 00:48:33.625
of 205 Communists in
the Department of State.


854
00:48:33.708 --> 00:48:36.291
That discovery propelled
him into the headlines.


855
00:48:36.375 --> 00:48:40.625
There is no remote
possibility of this war


856
00:48:40.708 --> 00:48:44.917
which we're in today
ending except by victory


857
00:48:44.999 --> 00:48:47.667
or by death for
this civilization.


858
00:48:47.750 --> 00:48:50.833
He then starts this
campaign executed


859
00:48:50.917 --> 00:48:53.416
in the Senate through
different committees,


860
00:48:53.500 --> 00:48:56.249
but mainly in the newspapers.

861
00:48:56.333 --> 00:48:59.667
McCarthy understood
that headlines


862
00:48:59.750 --> 00:49:01.999
spoke louder than details.

863
00:49:02.999 --> 00:49:05.583
He would have loved Twitter.

864
00:49:05.667 --> 00:49:09.750
He is the master of making
the sensational charge,


865
00:49:09.833 --> 00:49:12.166
often with very
little basis to it,


866
00:49:12.249 --> 00:49:14.625
and the press amplifies it.

867
00:49:14.708 --> 00:49:18.375
And here is our guest,
Senator Joseph R. McCarthy.


868
00:49:18.458 --> 00:49:20.333
If you had to do
this all over again,


869
00:49:20.416 --> 00:49:22.291
would you have changed
any of your tactics?


870
00:49:22.375 --> 00:49:24.416
I'm not, uh, equipped to use

871
00:49:24.500 --> 00:49:26.958
lace-handkerchief
type of tactics.


872
00:49:27.041 --> 00:49:28.958
Uh, we may have to
use lumberjack tactics,


873
00:49:29.041 --> 00:49:31.291
bare-knuckle tactics. If
those are the only kind


874
00:49:31.375 --> 00:49:33.375
of tactics the
Communists understand,


875
00:49:33.458 --> 00:49:35.375
then those are the
tactics we'll use.


876
00:49:35.458 --> 00:49:37.178
There's an enormous
number of lives


877
00:49:37.208 --> 00:49:39.792
that were wrecked
because of these charges.


878
00:49:39.875 --> 00:49:43.458
Senator McCarthy's
charges and insinuations


879
00:49:43.541 --> 00:49:47.667
are not only false,
but utterly irresponsible


880
00:49:47.750 --> 00:49:52.333
and, under the circumstances,
reveal a shocking disregard


881
00:49:52.416 --> 00:49:54.458
for the interests
of our country.


882
00:49:54.541 --> 00:49:57.667
McCarthy, his own
lawyer Roy Cohn said,


883
00:49:57.750 --> 00:49:59.291
was an opportunist.

884
00:49:59.375 --> 00:50:02.583
He wasn't really
interested in the end


885
00:50:02.667 --> 00:50:04.458
of fighting Communism.

886
00:50:04.541 --> 00:50:07.792
He was interested in the
means of fighting Communism,


887
00:50:07.875 --> 00:50:10.208
because the means
made him more popular,


888
00:50:10.291 --> 00:50:12.166
made him more powerful.

889
00:50:13.750 --> 00:50:16.166
McCarthy's political base

890
00:50:16.249 --> 00:50:18.166
was a source of fear,

891
00:50:18.249 --> 00:50:20.583
particularly for other
Republican senators.


892
00:50:20.667 --> 00:50:22.375
McCarthy gave the impression

893
00:50:22.458 --> 00:50:24.667
that he was leading
this vast army.


894
00:50:24.750 --> 00:50:26.875
His other fellow
senators weren't sure


895
00:50:26.958 --> 00:50:29.249
how big that army
was, but if it was big,


896
00:50:29.333 --> 00:50:32.208
they sure as hell didn't
wanna run afoul of it.


897
00:50:34.416 --> 00:50:36.750
Acclaimed as an
anti-Communist hero


898
00:50:36.833 --> 00:50:38.553
and denounced as a
threat to civil liberties


899
00:50:38.625 --> 00:50:40.500
for his conduct of
Senate investigations,


900
00:50:40.583 --> 00:50:43.291
Joseph R. McCarthy
became the most controversial


901
00:50:43.375 --> 00:50:45.249
political figure of the period.

902
00:50:47.124 --> 00:50:48.559
There was a huge
amount of debate


903
00:50:48.583 --> 00:50:49.875
during the McCarthy era

904
00:50:49.958 --> 00:50:52.999
about whether a
journalistic institution


905
00:50:53.083 --> 00:50:55.041
should simply
report what was said


906
00:50:55.124 --> 00:50:57.625
without assessing its validity.

907
00:50:57.708 --> 00:51:00.208
It's the same kind of
debate that goes on today.


908
00:51:00.291 --> 00:51:03.833
Just because someone in
power says something crazy,


909
00:51:03.917 --> 00:51:06.041
do you have to
report what that is?


910
00:51:06.124 --> 00:51:08.792
If you report it, do
you say it's crazy?


911
00:51:08.875 --> 00:51:12.041
Or does that somehow violate
the neutrality of the news?


912
00:51:12.124 --> 00:51:14.541
So, in the midst of
the McCarthy scare,


913
00:51:14.625 --> 00:51:16.875
Palmer Hoyt, who was
the editor and publisher


914
00:51:16.958 --> 00:51:20.375
of the Denver Post,
issued a statement saying,


915
00:51:20.458 --> 00:51:23.166
"We are no longer
simply going to report


916
00:51:23.249 --> 00:51:26.249
what Joe McCarthy says,
unless we can confirm it."


917
00:51:26.333 --> 00:51:28.667
Hoyt's view was
widely discussed,


918
00:51:28.750 --> 00:51:32.166
huge debates in
newsrooms about what to do.


919
00:51:32.249 --> 00:51:34.625
Tonight's See It Now
devotes its entire half hour


920
00:51:34.708 --> 00:51:36.792
to a report on Senator
Joseph R. McCarthy,


921
00:51:36.875 --> 00:51:39.541
told mainly in his own
words and pictures.


922
00:51:39.625 --> 00:51:42.708
Did the Civil Liberties Union
supply you with an attorney?


923
00:51:42.792 --> 00:51:44.249
They did supply an attorney.

924
00:51:44.333 --> 00:51:46.708
Edward R. Murrow's
program would say,


925
00:51:46.792 --> 00:51:49.375
"The senator has said this,
but he has no evidence."


926
00:51:49.458 --> 00:51:51.875
Do you know the Civil
Liberties Union has been listed


927
00:51:51.958 --> 00:51:55.249
as a front for and doing the
work of the Communist Party?


928
00:51:55.333 --> 00:51:57.917
The Attorney General's list
does not and has never listed


929
00:51:57.999 --> 00:51:59.583
the ACLU as subversive,

930
00:51:59.667 --> 00:52:03.583
nor does the FBI or any other
federal government agency.


931
00:52:03.667 --> 00:52:05.583
I think when Palmer Hoyt,

932
00:52:05.667 --> 00:52:07.166
when Edward R. Murrow said,

933
00:52:07.249 --> 00:52:09.166
"This is what we
think the truth is,"


934
00:52:09.249 --> 00:52:12.333
they were living up
to the best tradition


935
00:52:12.416 --> 00:52:13.541
of those better angels.

936
00:52:13.625 --> 00:52:16.458
The line between
investigating and persecuting


937
00:52:16.541 --> 00:52:17.625
is a very fine one.

938
00:52:17.708 --> 00:52:19.875
And the junior
senator from Wisconsin


939
00:52:19.958 --> 00:52:21.917
has stepped over it repeatedly.

940
00:52:21.999 --> 00:52:23.958
This is no time for
men who oppose


941
00:52:24.041 --> 00:52:26.249
Senator McCarthy's
message to keep silent,


942
00:52:26.333 --> 00:52:28.375
or for those who approve.

943
00:52:28.458 --> 00:52:30.833
We can deny our
heritage and our history,


944
00:52:30.917 --> 00:52:33.917
but we cannot escape
responsibility for the result.


945
00:52:35.917 --> 00:52:37.416
If you're a journalist today

946
00:52:37.500 --> 00:52:40.166
trying to figure out what to
do about a demagogic figure


947
00:52:40.249 --> 00:52:42.333
who makes
outlandish statements...


948
00:52:43.249 --> 00:52:46.625
studying the McCarthy
era is instructive.


949
00:52:46.708 --> 00:52:49.458
In Washington, a Senate
committee recommends


950
00:52:49.541 --> 00:52:51.375
censure for Joseph McCarthy.

951
00:52:51.458 --> 00:52:53.667
It took a long time, four years.

952
00:52:53.750 --> 00:52:56.375
But ultimately,
McCarthy is censured.


953
00:52:56.458 --> 00:52:58.833
McCarthy becomes the
fourth senator in history


954
00:52:58.917 --> 00:53:00.041
to be disciplined.

955
00:53:00.124 --> 00:53:03.875
McCarthy rose on
screaming headlines:


956
00:53:04.917 --> 00:53:07.124
"Reds under the bed."

957
00:53:07.208 --> 00:53:13.041
He fell when some reporters,
including Edward R. Murrow,


958
00:53:13.124 --> 00:53:16.375
began assessing the
validity of those claims.


959
00:53:23.333 --> 00:53:25.375
Purists versus pragmatists.

960
00:53:26.667 --> 00:53:30.333
In politics, we tend to want

961
00:53:30.416 --> 00:53:34.583
candidates to be principled,

962
00:53:34.667 --> 00:53:39.041
coherent, uh, absolutely
devoted to a certain platform,


963
00:53:39.124 --> 00:53:40.684
and they're gonna
do everything they can


964
00:53:40.708 --> 00:53:42.792
to enact that platform, right?

965
00:53:42.875 --> 00:53:46.750
The issue is, if you're
in a position of power,


966
00:53:46.833 --> 00:53:52.750
if you are totally devoted
to that purist principle,


967
00:53:52.833 --> 00:53:55.583
you have less of a chance
of getting through the day


968
00:53:55.667 --> 00:53:56.958
and getting something done.

969
00:53:57.041 --> 00:53:59.708
I would argue some of
the greatest moments


970
00:53:59.792 --> 00:54:02.875
in American political
life have resulted


971
00:54:02.958 --> 00:54:06.166
when people in power
have changed their minds.


972
00:54:07.124 --> 00:54:08.375
Hmm.

973
00:54:08.458 --> 00:54:11.083
Abraham Lincoln on emancipation.

974
00:54:11.166 --> 00:54:13.458
Ronald Reagan
on the Soviet Union.


975
00:54:13.541 --> 00:54:15.750
Richard Nixon on China.

976
00:54:15.833 --> 00:54:18.249
The country was built by people

977
00:54:18.333 --> 00:54:20.750
who were willing to
learn from their mistakes.


978
00:54:20.833 --> 00:54:23.917
We looked the facts in the face,

979
00:54:23.999 --> 00:54:25.458
and we thought, "You know what?

980
00:54:25.541 --> 00:54:28.166
What we thought was
true and good yesterday


981
00:54:28.249 --> 00:54:30.500
is not true and good today."

Thank you, all.

983

That's not a partisan point.

984
00:54:33.958 --> 00:54:36.875
It's about the capacity to say,

00:54:36.958 --> 00:54:41.416

that looks and feels like this."

1007
00:55:47.999 --> 00:55:52.041
What's your best advice
for folks in the arena today?


1008
00:55:52.124 --> 00:55:55.124
I think a part of the
direction is to go the way


1009
00:55:55.208 --> 00:55:59.500
of the Rosa Parks, Martin
Luther King movement.


1010
00:55:59.583 --> 00:56:01.458
Because love is powerful.

1011
00:56:01.541 --> 00:56:05.500
Love is not an
empty, uh, quiet force.


1012
00:56:05.583 --> 00:56:11.041
It's a force that we have not
yet begun to really explore.


1013
00:56:11.792 --> 00:56:12.833
And so,

1014
00:56:12.917 --> 00:56:16.917
that nonviolent movement
was rooted in that.


1015
00:56:16.999 --> 00:56:20.917
So I think that that's one of
the things that I would push,


1016
00:56:20.999 --> 00:56:24.375
so that we can be
pushed hard to recognize


1017
00:56:24.458 --> 00:56:27.625
that we are people on a journey,

1018
00:56:28.500 --> 00:56:31.625
and that that
journey does demand


1019
00:56:31.708 --> 00:56:33.458
a certain kind of behavior.

1020
00:56:35.583 --> 00:56:37.500
Anything doesn't go.

1021
00:56:43.667 --> 00:56:46.041
The hundred years from
the end of the Civil War


1022
00:56:46.124 --> 00:56:47.917
through the civil
rights movement


1023
00:56:47.999 --> 00:56:51.083
is a vivid case
study in the struggle


1024
00:56:51.166 --> 00:56:53.792
between our worst instincts
and our better angels.


1025
00:56:55.083 --> 00:56:58.875
In the civil rights
legislation of '64 and '65,


1026
00:56:58.958 --> 00:57:00.541
our better angels won...

1027
00:57:03.375 --> 00:57:07.041
in a ferocious struggle
with our worst instincts.


1028
00:57:09.708 --> 00:57:13.041
And if we want a model
for how to move ahead,


1029
00:57:13.124 --> 00:57:16.375
looking at those
years is instructive.

1031

During the '60s, we felt
the stain of segregation


1032
00:57:32.708 --> 00:57:34.667
and racial discrimination.

1033

We cannot continue to accept

these conditions of oppression,

1037

for this is not a struggle
for ourselves alone,


1038

it is a struggle to save
the soul of America.


1039
00:57:55.041 --> 00:57:57.225
When I participated
in the movement,


1040
00:57:57.249 --> 00:57:58.583
I was 15.

1041
00:57:58.667 --> 00:58:00.667
It would not have
been successful


1042

had it not been for
ordinary little nobodies


1043

doing their part
to make it happen.


1044
00:58:07.333 --> 00:58:11.375
By 1963, the full
panoply of segregation


1045
00:58:11.458 --> 00:58:12.958
was under attack.

1046
00:58:13.041 --> 00:58:16.458
It begins to culminate
on the streets of Alabama.


1047
00:58:16.541 --> 00:58:17.981
The campaign was directed

1048
00:58:18.041 --> 00:58:20.291
against racial
discrimination in Birmingham,


1049
00:58:20.375 --> 00:58:22.792
the most totally segregated
big city in the south.


1050
00:58:22.875 --> 00:58:25.667
I had a made-up
mind that I could handle


1051
00:58:25.750 --> 00:58:28.917
whatever was coming,
and be nonviolent.


1052
00:58:30.708 --> 00:58:32.508
In May, thousands
of children marched


1053
00:58:32.583 --> 00:58:34.583
against segregation
in Birmingham.


1054
00:58:34.667 --> 00:58:37.333
The city is determined
to maintain order.


1055
00:58:37.416 --> 00:58:40.249
They're attacked by fire hoses,

1056
00:58:40.333 --> 00:58:42.541
by police dogs.

1057
00:58:42.625 --> 00:58:45.416
To see children
treated like this,


1058
00:58:45.500 --> 00:58:47.958
the whole nation
rose up in arms.


1059

The events in Birmingham

1060
00:58:49.750 --> 00:58:52.166
have sent a chill
through most Americans.


1061
00:58:52.249 --> 00:58:54.541
What the movement
did is dramatize


1062
00:58:54.625 --> 00:58:56.958
the stakes between
good and evil.


1063

who attempts to enroll at
the University of Alabama.


1066
00:59:04.124 --> 00:59:08.625
All of these incidents have
a slow, cascading effect


1067
00:59:08.708 --> 00:59:10.625

And honestly, the opinion
of President Kennedy.


1070
00:59:17.041 --> 00:59:20.375
I remember President
Kennedy saying to us


1071
00:59:20.458 --> 00:59:24.333
on one occasion,
"We now understand."


1072
00:59:24.416 --> 00:59:26.667
This nation was
founded on the principle


1073
00:59:26.750 --> 00:59:28.708
that all men are created equal,

1074
00:59:28.792 --> 00:59:31.208
and that the rights of
every man are diminished


1075
00:59:31.291 --> 00:59:34.124
when the rights of one
man are threatened.

Kennedy and Johnson propose

a far-reaching Civil Rights Act.

It was not going
particularly well.


1081

I do solemnly swear...

Johnson takes the oath
of office on Air Force One,


1089
01:00:05.999 --> 01:00:07.208
becomes president.

1090
01:00:07.291 --> 01:00:11.583
We have suffered a loss

1094
01:00:19.124 --> 01:00:21.667
That night, Johnson
is lying in bed,


1095
01:00:21.750 --> 01:00:24.375
and he's listing off
things he wants to do:


1096
01:00:24.458 --> 01:00:26.249
foreign leaders that
need to be called,


1097
01:00:26.333 --> 01:00:27.750
funeral arrangements.

1098
01:00:27.833 --> 01:00:31.500
But in the midst of this,
he says he wants to pass


1099
01:00:31.583 --> 01:00:34.083
the administration's
civil rights bill


1100
01:00:34.166 --> 01:00:35.875
without changing a comma.

1101
01:00:37.625 --> 01:00:39.291
And it was kind of a
remarkable moment


1102
01:00:39.375 --> 01:00:43.375
because Johnson had a
presidential race coming up.


1103
01:00:44.583 --> 01:00:47.416
No more political
man ever drew breath


1104
01:00:47.500 --> 01:00:49.208
than Lyndon Baines Johnson.

1105
01:00:49.291 --> 01:00:53.291
Johnson had been a senator
from Texas, a segregated state.


1106
01:00:53.375 --> 01:00:56.041
A lot of debate about to
what extent he watered down


1107
01:00:56.124 --> 01:00:58.708
civil rights legislation
in the '50s, but he did.


1108
01:00:59.958 --> 01:01:03.917
He was in no way a
leading progressive.


1109
01:01:03.999 --> 01:01:07.458
And so, you wouldn't have
bet that Lyndon Johnson


1110
01:01:07.541 --> 01:01:10.625
was gonna try to finish
the work of Lincoln.


1111
01:01:10.708 --> 01:01:15.999
Everything about that moment
would have led him politically


1112
01:01:16.083 --> 01:01:18.999
to have made all
kinds of promises,


1113
01:01:19.083 --> 01:01:21.625
all kinds of rhetorical nods

1114
01:01:21.708 --> 01:01:23.708
to the civil rights legislation,

1115
01:01:23.792 --> 01:01:25.583
but not to pursue it.

1116
01:01:27.083 --> 01:01:31.083
There was something
in Johnson's soul


1117
01:01:32.249 --> 01:01:34.416
that led him to believe

1118
01:01:34.500 --> 01:01:36.750
that this was the
moment to strike.


1119
01:02:13.750 --> 01:02:16.875
Lyndon Johnson was
a strong, strong leader.


1120
01:02:16.958 --> 01:02:19.124
He made a commitment
to those of us


1121
01:02:19.208 --> 01:02:21.041
in the civil rights movement,

1122
01:02:21.124 --> 01:02:25.166
that he would pick up where
President Kennedy left off.


1123
01:02:26.458 --> 01:02:27.625
And he did.

1124
01:02:27.708 --> 01:02:30.708
Lyndon Johnson risked
just about everything


1125
01:02:30.792 --> 01:02:32.166
for civil rights.

1126
01:02:32.249 --> 01:02:33.625
As he later put it,

1127
01:02:33.708 --> 01:02:36.291
"What the hell is
the presidency for


1128
01:02:36.375 --> 01:02:40.166
if not to do the big things
that other men might not?"


1129
01:02:42.833 --> 01:02:45.249
Ladies and gentlemen,
we're going to pass


1130
01:02:45.333 --> 01:02:47.750
the civil rights bill
because it's morally right.


1131
01:02:47.833 --> 01:02:51.083
What Johnson then
did from '63 to '64


1132
01:02:51.166 --> 01:02:53.833
is he created a
remarkable coalition


1133
01:02:53.917 --> 01:02:56.083
of Republicans and Democrats

1134
01:02:56.166 --> 01:02:59.249
to pass a law that
would finally undo


1135
01:02:59.333 --> 01:03:01.917
what had been
the racist reaction


1136
01:03:01.999 --> 01:03:03.917
to the verdict of the Civil War.

1137
01:03:03.999 --> 01:03:05.750
I promise you here and now

1138
01:03:05.833 --> 01:03:09.041
that we are going to
pass a civil rights bill.


1139
01:03:09.124 --> 01:03:11.750
Lyndon Johnson was
one of the great persuaders


1140
01:03:11.833 --> 01:03:12.833
in American politics.

1141
01:03:12.917 --> 01:03:14.667
The "Johnson
treatment," it was called.


1142
01:03:14.750 --> 01:03:17.708
We will pass the
strongest civil rights bill


1143
01:03:17.792 --> 01:03:19.792
in American history.

1144
01:03:19.875 --> 01:03:23.124
The trade-offs, the deals cut

1145
01:03:23.208 --> 01:03:25.458
to get to a legislative solution

1146
01:03:25.541 --> 01:03:26.958
is the work of politics.

1147
01:03:27.041 --> 01:03:31.458
July 2nd, 1964, President
Lyndon B. Johnson


1148
01:03:31.541 --> 01:03:34.458
signed the civil
rights bill into law.


1149
01:03:34.541 --> 01:03:37.124
I urge every American

1150
01:03:37.208 --> 01:03:39.291
to join in this effort

1151
01:03:39.375 --> 01:03:43.625
to bring justice and
hope to all our people


1152
01:03:43.708 --> 01:03:46.583
and to bring peace to our land.

and the Voting Rights Act,

taken together in '64 and '65,

1155
01:03:55.958 --> 01:04:01.541
represent what concentrated
acts of citizenship can do


1156
01:04:01.625 --> 01:04:04.708
when they intersect
with the attention


1157
01:04:04.792 --> 01:04:07.375
and the skill of those in power.

1158
01:04:08.999 --> 01:04:12.917
Lyndon Johnson heeded
the work of Martin Luther King,


1159
01:04:12.999 --> 01:04:16.041
the work of Rosa Parks,
the work of John Lewis,


1160
01:04:16.124 --> 01:04:19.792
the work of innumerable people
whose names we will never know,

about economic inequality,

I'm gonna disagree with you.

But here's the difference.

1202
01:06:31.249 --> 01:06:34.291
If you get up and
I listen and I think,


1203

"Huh, maybe you have a point,"

happens when you say,
"Huh, maybe you have a point."

The second is humility.

1207

Humility in the sense of
being able to acknowledge


1208
01:06:48.875 --> 01:06:50.958
a mistake and learn from it.

Most of us wouldn't

the Bay of Pigs
in April of 1961.

There are from this
sobering episode


1213
01:07:00.166 --> 01:07:02.249
useful lessons
for us all to learn.


1214
01:07:02.333 --> 01:07:04.458
After the disaster in Cuba,

1215

Kennedy reaches out to
the one person on Earth


1216
01:07:07.249 --> 01:07:09.375
before whom he
least wished to appear


1217
01:07:09.458 --> 01:07:12.583
to be in need of tutelage,
and that was Eisenhower.


1218
01:07:13.750 --> 01:07:15.559
Eisenhower walked him
through what had happened,


1219
01:07:15.583 --> 01:07:17.875
he realized that Kennedy
had never held a meeting


1220
01:07:17.958 --> 01:07:19.041
with all the stakeholders,

1221
01:07:19.124 --> 01:07:21.750
so he couldn't weigh
their arguments.


1222
01:07:21.833 --> 01:07:23.750
He said, "You have to do that."

1223

Cut to October 1962.

offensive missile sites

1226
01:07:33.291 --> 01:07:35.625
The purpose of these
bases can be none other


1227
01:07:35.708 --> 01:07:38.541
than to provide a
nuclear strike capability


1228
01:07:38.625 --> 01:07:40.416
against the western hemisphere.

1229
01:07:40.500 --> 01:07:43.291
Kennedy remembered what
Eisenhower had told him,


1230
01:07:43.375 --> 01:07:44.625
and he held what became

1231
01:07:44.708 --> 01:07:46.375
the world's longest
committee meeting.


1232
01:07:46.458 --> 01:07:48.124
It lasted 13 days.

1233
01:07:52.500 --> 01:07:54.750
We came through that crisis,

1234
01:07:54.833 --> 01:07:58.291
not least because Jack
Kennedy had the power to admit


1235
01:07:58.375 --> 01:08:00.625
he had screwed up
and needed to learn.


1236
01:08:02.500 --> 01:08:04.500
And if we can't find a way

1237
01:08:04.583 --> 01:08:06.750
to admit that we
changed our mind,


1238
01:08:08.249 --> 01:08:09.958

1240

able to see the world


1241
01:08:15.958 --> 01:08:17.291
through other people's eyes.

1242
01:08:17.375 --> 01:08:19.999
Cut to November 1989.

1243
01:08:20.083 --> 01:08:22.667
Good evening. Live
from the Berlin Wall


1244
01:08:22.750 --> 01:08:25.291
on the most historic
night in this wall's history.


1245
01:08:25.375 --> 01:08:27.559
The most vivid symbol
of the deadliest standoff


1246
01:08:27.583 --> 01:08:29.583
in human history,
the Berlin Wall, falls.


1247
01:08:29.667 --> 01:08:32.166
To Acknowledge the
tremendous significance


1248
01:08:32.249 --> 01:08:34.917
of the symbolic destruction
of the Berlin Wall,


1249
01:08:34.999 --> 01:08:39.375
I urge President Bush
to travel to West Berlin.


1250
01:08:39.458 --> 01:08:41.142
Democrats, everybody's
pounding on Bush


1251
01:08:41.166 --> 01:08:43.500
to go to Berlin and
declare a great victory.


1252
01:08:43.583 --> 01:08:45.541
It clearly is a good development

1253
01:08:45.625 --> 01:08:47.083
in terms of human rights.

1254
01:08:47.166 --> 01:08:48.333
Bush won't go.

1255
01:08:48.416 --> 01:08:50.208
Lesley Stahl is pounding on him.

1256
01:08:50.291 --> 01:08:51.833
You don't seem elated,

1257
01:08:51.917 --> 01:08:53.437
and I'm wondering
if you're thinking...


1258
01:08:53.500 --> 01:08:56.333
I'm elated. I'm just not
an emotional kinda guy.


1259
01:08:56.416 --> 01:08:58.750
He was thinking about
Mikhail Gorbachev,


1260
01:08:58.833 --> 01:09:00.750
who had a hardcore right wing

1261
01:09:00.833 --> 01:09:03.375
that did not wanna see
Soviet greatness go away,


1262
01:09:03.458 --> 01:09:06.041
and if you doubt me, I refer you

1263
01:09:06.124 --> 01:09:09.416
to a young KGB officer
named Vladimir Putin,


1264
01:09:09.500 --> 01:09:11.917
who was part of that right wing.

1265
01:09:11.999 --> 01:09:13.291
Bush knew that if he showed up,

1266
01:09:13.375 --> 01:09:16.166
it was gonna make
Gorbachev's life harder.


1267
01:09:16.249 --> 01:09:17.750
And so, he took the hit.

1268
01:09:17.833 --> 01:09:20.958
His low-key reaction of
yesterday was another case


1269
01:09:21.041 --> 01:09:23.249
of what critics have
called timid leadership.


1270
01:09:23.333 --> 01:09:26.583
Christmas Day, 1991, the
Soviet Union disappears


1271
01:09:26.667 --> 01:09:28.041
without a shot being fired.

1272
01:09:29.458 --> 01:09:31.875
He was empathetic enough to know

1273
01:09:31.958 --> 01:09:34.792
that our national
interest was being served


1274
01:09:34.875 --> 01:09:38.124
by his seeing the world
through Gorbachev's eyes.


1275
01:09:41.166 --> 01:09:45.792
We have to create a climate
that gives enough permission

for people who are in office

1277
01:09:47.750 --> 01:09:50.958
to actually make that
compromise or two.


1278
01:09:52.083 --> 01:09:53.583
I mean, that's on us.

there is a way out,

we've done this again

that the American experiment
is flawed but ultimately


1297

better than anything else
we've seen anywhere else.

it is he believes in.

The work of citizenship

at this particular moment,

1302
01:10:56.124 --> 01:10:58.917
if you believe that
we need a change


1303
01:10:58.999 --> 01:11:00.833
in the presidency
of the United States,


1304
01:11:00.917 --> 01:11:04.917
the work becomes convincing

and they need to agree with you.

1307
01:11:09.333 --> 01:11:12.833
And so, the work of
citizenship now is, in fact,


1308
01:11:12.917 --> 01:11:15.541
the work of democracy
in its purest sense.


1309
01:11:16.999 --> 01:11:22.166
I think our role as citizens is
to become civically engaged.


1310

If the Japanese Americans

from the American ideal today

than it was three
or four years ago.


1322

People think the
other side is evil


1323

and must be stopped.

1324
01:11:54.999 --> 01:11:57.541
The internment
that we went through


1325
01:11:57.625 --> 01:12:00.999
is history now, 75 years old,

1326

is current news.

These facilities have
now been repurposed


1328
01:12:08.208 --> 01:12:10.833
as detention
centers for families.

What's happening on
our southern borders

Lock her up! Lock her up!

Lock her up! Lock her up!

1333
01:12:22.041 --> 01:12:23.416
She was warned.

1334
01:12:23.500 --> 01:12:25.333
She was given an explanation.

1335
01:12:25.416 --> 01:12:27.999
Nevertheless, she persisted.

1336
01:12:28.083 --> 01:12:30.059
One of the things that
the women's movement

01:12:30.083 --> 01:12:32.041
fought for in that
early incarnation


1338
01:12:32.124 --> 01:12:34.333
was the idea that women
should just be able to


1339
01:12:34.416 --> 01:12:36.708
stand up and speak of politics.

hate and division.

what Thomas Jefferson
