We'd been stationed
to Gévaudan.

They were plagued
by a wolf.


911
01:00:21.352 --> 01:00:24.346
Two people had been killed
in the first week,


912
01:00:24.388 --> 01:00:26.423
six the following.

913
01:00:27.725 --> 01:00:29.727
That's when the army
had been drafted in.


914
01:00:32.830 --> 01:00:36.233
There was talk
that the wolf was a curse,


915
01:00:37.301 --> 01:00:39.336
and if people need to know.

916
01:00:42.439 --> 01:00:44.742
The first time I saw it,

917
01:00:45.342 --> 01:00:47.912
it was covered
in fresh blood,


918
01:00:48.379 --> 01:00:50.381
just outside our village.

919
01:00:51.215 --> 01:00:54.919
By the time I got back there,
it was... too late.


920
01:00:56.220 --> 01:00:59.190
Thirteen people
had been killed by the beast.


921
01:01:00.324 --> 01:01:02.893
My wife and daughter
were among them.


922

I'm so sorry.

923
01:01:25.482 --> 01:01:28.185
Did they ever catch
this wolf?


924
01:01:31.222 --> 01:01:33.348
Shortly after that,

925
01:01:33.390 --> 01:01:36.393
a band of traveling gypsies
came to Gévaudan.


926
01:01:37.394 --> 01:01:40.122
They said the curse
had had its revenge


927
01:01:40.164 --> 01:01:43.234
and was to be contained
in gypsy silver.


928
01:01:44.134 --> 01:01:45.528
They then traveled northwest,

929
01:01:45.570 --> 01:01:48.005
but the trail went cold
in Le Malzieu.


930
01:01:49.206 --> 01:01:52.309
Well, the gypsies had a claim
on my husband's land.


931
01:01:52.843 --> 01:01:54.436
My husband and the elders...

932
01:01:54.478 --> 01:01:55.379
That's enough!

933
01:02:01.553 --> 01:02:03.053
That's enough.

934
01:02:04.355 --> 01:02:06.056
I want no more talk
of curses.


935
01:02:06.991 --> 01:02:08.259
We've locked everybody
in a church,


936
01:02:08.459 --> 01:02:10.352
and I have nobody
working the fields.


937
01:02:10.394 --> 01:02:12.963
If you're here to help,
then please help.
