1
00:01:38.269 --> 00:01:42.189
Yes, ladies and gentlemen,
we are in luck today here in Los Angeles.


2
00:01:42.482 --> 00:01:44.775
Through the years,
the Bullwinkle Galleries...


3
00:01:44.984 --> 00:01:46.568
...have brought up for auction...

4
00:01:46.778 --> 00:01:50.948
...many collections of the personal effects
of your famous movie stars.


5
00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.369
But today is indeed a red-letter day.

6
00:01:55.578 --> 00:01:58.413
The personal effects of Tony Hunter!

7
00:01:58.790 --> 00:01:59.915
Lot 94.

8
00:02:00.124 --> 00:02:04.002
Ladies and gentlemen,
let's start out with Lot 94.


9
00:02:04.629 --> 00:02:09.091
Some of the potpourri
of Mr. Hunter's own personal costumes...


10
00:02:09.467 --> 00:02:13.053
...that he used in his famous
dancing-singing pictures.


11
00:02:13.263 --> 00:02:16.306
Remember this?
Perhaps the most famous top hat...


12
00:02:16.516 --> 00:02:18.308
...and stick of our generation.

13
00:02:18.518 --> 00:02:22.312
Yes, the one he used
in Swinging Down to Panama...


14
00:02:22.522 --> 00:02:24.606
...and all his other famous pictures.

15
00:02:24.983 --> 00:02:28.610
Let's start with $5. Do I hear $5?

16
00:02:29.153 --> 00:02:31.071
It's worth a lot more.

17
00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:33.824
All right. Let's start with 2.

18
00:02:34.367 --> 00:02:37.411
Well? Fifty cents?

19
00:02:39.455 --> 00:02:40.747
Anything?

20
00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:52.592
Just one more for the road.
About 20 minutes to New York.


21
00:02:52.802 --> 00:02:54.094
Bottoms up.

22
00:02:57.432 --> 00:03:00.142
- So you're from California?
- That's right. Sunny Cal.


23
00:03:00.351 --> 00:03:02.728
- Sunny Cal?
- Yeah. Sunny Cal.


24
00:03:03.021 --> 00:03:06.648
Say, you're from Sunny Cal. I bet
you know a lot of movie stars out there.


25
00:03:06.858 --> 00:03:08.984
I got to confess. 
I'm just like you and me.

26
00:03:09.193 --> 00:03:11.486
- Only get to see them in the movies.
- Ha, ha.


27
00:03:11.696 --> 00:03:14.281
But I read about them.
I know all about them.


28
00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:18.410
Boy, I'd sure like to meet
that Ava Gardner.


29
00:03:18.786 --> 00:03:21.413
- You're a little late. She's married.
- Yeah.


30
00:03:21.914 --> 00:03:23.749
- You know this one?
- Who's that?


31
00:03:23.958 --> 00:03:27.127
- Tony Hunter.
- Oh, him. The singing-dancing fella.


32
00:03:27.378 --> 00:03:31.381
My wife used to go see all his pictures.
Almost broke up our home.


33
00:03:31.591 --> 00:03:33.633
"Tony Hunter! Tony Hunter!"

34
00:03:34.135 --> 00:03:35.969
He was good 12 or 15 years ago...

35
00:03:36.179 --> 00:03:38.430
...but the columnists out there
say he's through.


36
00:03:39.265 --> 00:03:42.809
Through? He's washed up.
Hasn't made a picture in three years.


37
00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:45.979
- Did you say something, mister?
- I said I agreed with you.


38
00:03:46.189 --> 00:03:47.647
That Tony Hunter's a has-been.

39
00:03:47.857 --> 00:03:49.483
- Got a match?
- Yeah.


40
00:03:49.692 --> 00:03:52.861
I wouldn't go to see him
if they gave away $5 bills with the ticket.


41
00:03:54.489 --> 00:03:55.614
Yeah.

42
00:03:57.784 --> 00:03:59.701
We should be pulling...

43
00:04:00.036 --> 00:04:04.706
The funny thing about what you're saying,
boys, is that it's absolutely true.


44
00:04:04.999 --> 00:04:07.417
Here. Have an exploding cigar.

45
00:04:23.309 --> 00:04:25.560
- This the last of the bags, Mr. Hunter?
- Yeah.


46
00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:28.563
Say, porter, um, could you see that
they get put in a taxi...


47
00:04:28.773 --> 00:04:32.818
...and taken up to the, uh, Plaza Hotel?
- Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.


48
00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:35.362
Everybody's getting off, sir.

49
00:04:35.571 --> 00:04:38.824
If you don't mind,
I'll just sit for a minute or two.


50
00:04:39.033 --> 00:04:42.119
You couldn't just, uh, make up my berth
for the night here, could you?


51
00:04:42.328 --> 00:04:44.413
No, sir. I couldn't do that.

52
00:04:56.092 --> 00:04:58.802
There's a mob of reporters
and photographers out there.


53
00:04:59.011 --> 00:05:02.097
Yep. There must be some big shot aboard.
Maybe the president.


54
00:05:02.306 --> 00:05:05.392
No, too many for that.
Probably a movie star.


55
00:05:11.858 --> 00:05:14.443
- Hi, fellas.
- Tony Hunter! Hello, Mr. Hunter!


56
00:05:14.777 --> 00:05:17.279
Thanks for the red-carpet bit.
I didn't expect it.


57
00:05:17.488 --> 00:05:20.699
- What brings you to New York?
- Just fooling around.


58
00:05:20.908 --> 00:05:23.034
- Between pictures, Tony?
- In a manner of speaking.


59
00:05:23.244 --> 00:05:26.121
Didn't I read something in Variety
about you going into a show?


60
00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:29.749
Lily and Les Marton had something
planned for me. I haven't decided yet.


61
00:05:29.959 --> 00:05:33.879
I haven't been on the stage in a long time.
And you get into a different medium.


62
00:05:34.088 --> 00:05:35.839
- What it actually is...
- Here she is!


63
00:05:36.048 --> 00:05:37.924
- Excuse me, Mr. Hunter.
- See you later.


64
00:05:38.134 --> 00:05:39.217
Hi, Miss Gardner.

65
00:05:39.427 --> 00:05:41.803
Miss Gardner, hold it, please?
Smile pretty. Thanks.


66
00:05:42.013 --> 00:05:45.474
- How long you going to be in town?
- I have no definite plans.


67
00:05:45.683 --> 00:05:48.059
Tony! I had no idea
you were on the train.

68
00:05:48.269 --> 00:05:50.187
This is a surprise.
You going to be here long?


69
00:05:50.396 --> 00:05:52.606
- Perhaps a week or two...
- Excuse me, Miss Gardner.


70
00:05:52.815 --> 00:05:55.525
Could the boys get one more shot of you
coming out the door?


71
00:05:55.735 --> 00:05:58.278
Honestly, isn't all this stuff an awful bore?

72
00:05:58.488 --> 00:06:00.447
- Good to see you, Tony.
- It's nice to see you.


73
00:06:00.656 --> 00:06:04.409
By the door, please, Miss Gardner.
Once more! Here we go! Thank you.


74
00:06:04.619 --> 00:06:08.538
Miss Gardner, my paper would like
to do a Sunday feature on you.


75
00:06:09.916 --> 00:06:13.335
Those poor movie stars.
People just won't let them alone, will they?


76
00:06:13.544 --> 00:06:15.962
No. I don't know how they stand it.

77
00:06:19.509 --> 00:06:23.929
I'll go my way by myself

78
00:06:25.264 --> 00:06:28.850
Like walking under the clouds

79
00:06:30.853 --> 00:06:34.940
I'll go my way by myself

80
00:06:36.025 --> 00:06:39.611
All alone in a crowd

81
00:06:41.781 --> 00:06:45.784
I'll try to apply myself

82
00:06:46.994 --> 00:06:50.288
And teach my heart how to sing

83
00:06:52.542 --> 00:06:56.461
I'll go my way by myself

84
00:06:57.505 --> 00:07:01.174
Like a bird on the wing

85
00:07:03.177 --> 00:07:06.972
I'll face the unknown

86
00:07:08.266 --> 00:07:12.477
I'll build a world of my own

87
00:07:13.688 --> 00:07:18.149
No one knows better than I, myself

88
00:07:18.859 --> 00:07:25.865
I'm by myself alone

89
00:07:41.841 --> 00:07:44.759
Tony Hunter! There's Tony Hunter!

90
00:07:46.012 --> 00:07:52.434
Rah-rah, Tony, Tony Hunter
Sis-boom-bah, yay


91
00:07:52.643 --> 00:07:54.769
Did you kids paint
those signs just for me?

92
00:07:54.979 --> 00:07:57.022
That's cute. Piggy.

93
00:07:58.232 --> 00:07:59.858
Let's get rid of this stuff.

94
00:08:00.568 --> 00:08:02.777
This is the biggest surprise I've had.

95
00:08:07.116 --> 00:08:10.785
- Mister, can I have your autograph?
- You certainly can, gal, come here!


96
00:08:10.995 --> 00:08:12.287
That's my wife. Let go.

97
00:08:12.496 --> 00:08:14.748
Don't worry.
I'll get around to you in a minute.


98
00:08:14.957 --> 00:08:16.791
- Who's he?
- Never saw him before in my life.


99
00:08:17.001 --> 00:08:19.753
- Hello, piggy!
- Hello, yourself, you two-headed creep!


100
00:08:19.962 --> 00:08:21.546
Why didn't you say
when you were coming?


101
00:08:21.756 --> 00:08:22.922
We had to ask your agent.

102
00:08:23.132 --> 00:08:25.967
- Why didn't you send us a wire?
- I wanted to sneak in quietly.


103
00:08:26.177 --> 00:08:30.138
Believe me, I didn't have any trouble.
I want to see if you've changed in a year.


104
00:08:30.348 --> 00:08:33.642
No, Les, you haven't changed a bit.
You look desperately ill, as usual.


105
00:08:33.851 --> 00:08:35.977
- What'd you have to say that for?
- Just kidding.


106
00:08:36.187 --> 00:08:37.562
I've been feeling terrible all day.

107
00:08:37.772 --> 00:08:41.941
Kind of faint, lightheaded,
a lot of pressure here, queasy inside...


108
00:08:42.151 --> 00:08:43.568
...my pulse...
- You look great.


109
00:08:43.778 --> 00:08:47.322
As for you, that New York pallor
is like a breath of fresh air.


110
00:08:47.531 --> 00:08:51.618
You're too pretty to be a successful writer
and much too pretty to be married to that.


111
00:08:51.827 --> 00:08:53.912
That's the prettiest compliment
I've had all day!


112
00:08:54.121 --> 00:08:56.790
Come on, you two-headed lovebirds,
there's work to be done!


113
00:08:56.999 --> 00:09:00.377
- Now I have here a script of a show!
- Les, you didn't bring it.


114
00:09:00.586 --> 00:09:02.837
It's great. It's the best thing
we've ever written.


115
00:09:03.047 --> 00:09:05.340
Take it, boy. Smell it!
You can tell it's good.


116
00:09:05.549 --> 00:09:08.385
There's a great part in it for you,
nice little parts for us.


117
00:09:08.594 --> 00:09:11.346
Wait. This boy must be starving.
Let's take him to Sardi's.


118
00:09:16.435 --> 00:09:18.353
Only two blocks more, then Sardi's.

119
00:09:18.562 --> 00:09:21.439
- Shall we tell him, Lil, the big surprise?
- You tell him, Les.


120
00:09:21.649 --> 00:09:23.608
Who do you think is
going to do the show?

121
00:09:23.818 --> 00:09:27.904
Only the greatest director-producer
in town, Jeffrey Cordova.


122
00:09:28.114 --> 00:09:29.948
- Who?
- Jeff Cordova.


123
00:09:30.157 --> 00:09:32.826
We're meeting him tonight, backstage,
right after the show.


124
00:09:33.035 --> 00:09:35.537
- What did you say his name was?
- Jeffrey Cordova!


125
00:09:35.746 --> 00:09:36.830
You're not serious.

126
00:09:37.039 --> 00:09:39.165
I don't think he
ever heard of this fella.

127
00:09:39.375 --> 00:09:42.252
What's the matter? Don't you
get newspapers back in California?


128
00:09:42.461 --> 00:09:44.796
This genius directed Man in a Mousetrap...

129
00:09:45.005 --> 00:09:49.384
...The Lost Nymph, and did them both
while starring in Oedipus Rex.


130
00:09:49.593 --> 00:09:52.095
He's got three hits running,
and he's starring in one of them.


131
00:09:52.304 --> 00:09:53.513
Only one?

132
00:09:53.723 --> 00:09:57.642
This fella's fabulous, phenomenal,
fantastic! He can do anything.


133
00:09:57.852 --> 00:09:59.519
- Has he ever directed a musical?
- Oh...


134
00:09:59.729 --> 00:10:01.688
What's the difference? 
He can do anything.

135
00:10:01.897 --> 00:10:04.816
He's theater.
He's a new kind of theater man, Tony.


136
00:10:05.025 --> 00:10:07.277
The theater's changed.
Lots of things have changed.


137
00:10:07.486 --> 00:10:08.987
They certainly have.

138
00:10:10.322 --> 00:10:12.615
What's happened to 42nd Street?

139
00:10:13.534 --> 00:10:17.162
I just can't get over it.
I just can't understand it.


140
00:10:17.371 --> 00:10:20.790
This used to be the great theater street
of the town. The New Amsterdam.


141
00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.877
I had one of my biggest successes there.
Ran a year and a half.


142
00:10:24.086 --> 00:10:27.005
Noel Coward and Gertie
were here in Private Lives in the Selwyn.


143
00:10:27.214 --> 00:10:29.174
Strictly carriage trade,
nothing but the finest.


144
00:10:29.383 --> 00:10:33.428
First show I ever did was at the Eltinge,
and I don't believe that's here anymore.


145
00:10:33.637 --> 00:10:35.722
- Oh! Oh! Oh!
- What's the matter?


146
00:10:35.931 --> 00:10:38.516
- I think he broke my leg.
- Can you put your weight on it?


147
00:10:38.726 --> 00:10:40.769
- I'll try.
- I'm sorry! I didn't mean it.


148
00:10:40.978 --> 00:10:43.146
- Okay, forget it.
- Let's get him a cab.


149
00:10:43.355 --> 00:10:44.564
Taxi!

150
00:10:46.025 --> 00:10:47.108
Here, let me carry you.

151
00:10:47.318 --> 00:10:50.779
My dear man, it's entirely my fault
and I apologize.


152
00:10:50.988 --> 00:10:52.572
Here's for your trouble.

153
00:10:52.782 --> 00:10:55.241
- Ow! Ow! Ow!
- Lean on me.


154
00:10:55.451 --> 00:10:58.453
- I can stand anything but pain.
- You'll be all right.


155
00:10:58.662 --> 00:11:02.749
It's swelling. I'm getting a hematoma.
The blood is spurting out.


156
00:11:03.334 --> 00:11:06.795
I want some cold compresses!
Not hot, but cold.


157
00:11:07.004 --> 00:11:09.255
Listen, you go over to Sardi's.
I'll see you later.


158
00:11:09.465 --> 00:11:11.299
Driver, take them on over.
Order me a steak.


159
00:11:11.509 --> 00:11:12.842
I'll see you in a few minutes.

160
00:11:22.269 --> 00:11:23.311
Excuse me.

161
00:11:23.521 --> 00:11:27.023
I'm just a little bit fuzzy.
Wasn't this formerly the Eltinge theater?


162
00:11:34.448 --> 00:11:36.574
What are you doing in there?

163
00:13:23.557 --> 00:13:27.226
When you feel as low
As the bottom of a well


164
00:13:27.686 --> 00:13:30.021
And can't get out of the mood

165
00:13:31.482 --> 00:13:34.484
Do something to perk yourself up

166
00:13:34.693 --> 00:13:37.236
And change your attitude

167
00:13:38.322 --> 00:13:41.699
Give a tug to your tie
Put a crease in your pants


168
00:13:42.201 --> 00:13:44.661
But if you really want to feel fine

169
00:13:45.829 --> 00:13:50.166
Give your shoes a shine

170
00:13:53.379 --> 00:13:56.589
When there's a shine on your shoes

171
00:13:56.799 --> 00:13:58.800
There's a melody in your heart

172
00:13:59.259 --> 00:14:04.222
With a singable happy feeling
A wonderful way to start


173
00:14:04.431 --> 00:14:06.891
To face the world every day

174
00:14:07.643 --> 00:14:09.644
With the deedle-dum-dee-dah-dah

175
00:14:09.853 --> 00:14:14.649
A little melody that is making
The worrying world go by


176
00:14:14.858 --> 00:14:17.110
When you walk down the street

177
00:14:17.611 --> 00:14:19.737
With the happy-go-lucky beat

178
00:14:20.781 --> 00:14:24.409
You'll find a lot in what I'm repeating

179
00:14:24.660 --> 00:14:27.495
When there's a shine on your shoes

180
00:14:27.871 --> 00:14:30.164
There's a melody in your heart

181
00:14:30.374 --> 00:14:33.960
What a wonderful way to start the day

182
00:14:35.462 --> 00:14:38.297
Now there's a shine that you get
In the barbershop


183
00:14:40.467 --> 00:14:43.302
There's a shine that you get
In the Pullman car


184
00:14:45.514 --> 00:14:48.516
There's a shine that you get
In the pool room


185
00:14:50.519 --> 00:14:53.438
There's a shine that you get
In the school room


186
00:14:55.566 --> 00:14:57.859
But it doesn't matter where you get it

187
00:14:58.277 --> 00:15:00.987
It'll do a lot of
good if you let it

188
00:15:01.196 --> 00:15:04.240
A little bit of polish will abolish
What's bothering you


189
00:15:05.034 --> 00:15:08.077
When there's a shine on your shoes

190
00:15:08.662 --> 00:15:13.124
Melody in your heart
Singable happy feeling


191
00:15:13.709 --> 00:15:15.376
Wonderful!

192
00:15:47.493 --> 00:15:50.495
Got a shine on my shoes
Got a shine on my shoes


193
00:15:50.704 --> 00:15:53.664
Got a shine on my shoes
Got a shine on my shoes


194
00:15:53.957 --> 00:15:57.168
Got a shine on my shoes
Got a shine on my shoes


195
00:15:57.377 --> 00:16:00.505
Got a shine on my shoes
Got a shine on my shoes


196
00:16:00.964 --> 00:16:04.175
Shiny shoes! Shiny shoes!
Shiny shoes! Shiny shoes!


197
00:16:04.384 --> 00:16:07.428
Shiny shoes! Shiny shoes!
Shiny shoes! Shiny shoes!


198
00:16:07.638 --> 00:16:10.973
I got a shine shoes
Shiny shoes! Shiny shoes! Shiny shoes!


199
00:16:11.183 --> 00:16:13.976
Shine, shine, shine, shine on my shoes

200
00:16:15.395 --> 00:16:17.396
I got a shine on my shoes
I got a shine on my shoes


201
00:16:17.564 --> 00:16:20.608
I got a shine on my shoes
I got a shine on my shoes


202
00:16:20.818 --> 00:16:22.443
Got a shoeshine
Got a shoeshine


203
00:16:22.653 --> 00:16:24.112
Got a shoeshine
Got a shoeshine


204
00:16:24.321 --> 00:16:25.988
Got a shoeshine
Got a shoeshine


205
00:16:26.198 --> 00:16:28.199
Got a shoeshine
Got a shoeshine


206
00:16:57.980 --> 00:16:59.939
Yeah! Hooray!

207
00:17:51.283 --> 00:17:55.119
In such a time, indeed
You must reap doubly


208
00:17:55.621 --> 00:17:58.456
With a twofold pain

209
00:17:58.665 --> 00:18:02.543
Kind friend, you alone are faithful to me.

210
00:18:02.836 --> 00:18:04.212
Blind though I am...

211
00:18:04.421 --> 00:18:08.257
...I know that you are here,
and your voice is known to me.


212
00:18:10.010 --> 00:18:14.805
Oh, man of dark deed
How did you find the heart to blind yourself


213
00:18:15.015 --> 00:18:17.099
But deliver to all?

214
00:18:17.309 --> 00:18:20.311
Apollo, friends! Apollo!

215
00:18:22.064 --> 00:18:25.983
Come near me.
Lay your hand upon a wretched man.


216
00:18:26.652 --> 00:18:28.319
Do not fear.

217
00:18:28.528 --> 00:18:32.490
My plague can touch no one but me.

218
00:18:33.450 --> 00:18:35.743
Seize me and drive me out!

219
00:18:35.953 --> 00:18:39.330
Send me, for God's sake,
to some distant spot!


220
00:18:39.581 --> 00:18:41.916
Conceal me! Kill me!

221
00:18:42.834 --> 00:18:45.836
This guy is going to direct a musical?

222
00:18:47.172 --> 00:18:49.340
This guy can do anything.

223
00:18:53.762 --> 00:18:57.682
Therefore plan
For to death shall watch life's hand


224
00:18:58.600 --> 00:19:05.481
And can't all happy till thee pass
The earth away


225
00:19:07.234 --> 00:19:09.235
Sweetie, we start on the left foot!

226
00:19:09.444 --> 00:19:12.238
Always the left!
The whole exit depends upon...


227
00:19:12.447 --> 00:19:14.073
Lily, darling! How are you?

228
00:19:14.283 --> 00:19:15.574
Lester, how am I doing?

229
00:19:15.784 --> 00:19:17.785
- Jeff, this is Tony...
- Excuse me.


230
00:19:19.371 --> 00:19:21.414
Underneath it all, very simple.

231
00:19:21.623 --> 00:19:23.291
Isn't he wonderful?

232
00:19:28.213 --> 00:19:30.965
Listen. Order me
a corned-beef sandwich, will you?


233
00:19:31.174 --> 00:19:34.802
Lean, now, no fat, no gristle.
And a cream soda and a pickle.


234
00:19:35.804 --> 00:19:38.639
- Mr. Cordova wants a...
- Stay right here. It's all right.


235
00:19:38.849 --> 00:19:41.142
That maniac. Honestly! Say, Hal?

236
00:19:41.351 --> 00:19:43.394
- Yes, Miss Marton.
- The maestro wants his, uh...


237
00:19:43.603 --> 00:19:46.188
I know. The corned beef.
It's in his dressing room already.


238
00:19:46.398 --> 00:19:47.440
Hal, this is Mr. Hunter.

239
00:19:47.649 --> 00:19:50.067
- This is Hal Benton, Jeff's manager.
- Nice to meet you.


240
00:19:50.277 --> 00:19:51.944
- I'm a great admirer of yours.
- Thank you.


241
00:19:52.154 --> 00:19:55.406
- When did you get in town?
- I got off the train a couple of hours ago.


242
00:19:55.615 --> 00:19:58.576
- Wasn't that curtain slower tonight?
- It was my fault. I'm sorry.


243
00:19:58.785 --> 00:20:02.455
No, don't change it. Keep it that way.
It's wonderful. Doubles the applause.


244
00:20:02.664 --> 00:20:04.498
- This is Tony Hunter.
- How do you do?


245
00:20:04.708 --> 00:20:08.294
Sorry, kids. Be with you soon as I get out
of this sackcloth and ashes...


246
00:20:08.503 --> 00:20:12.131
Max, what happened to that amber spot?
It was way off.


247
00:20:12.341 --> 00:20:13.674
Must have more light on me there.

248
00:20:13.884 --> 00:20:15.968
Don't let us keep it a secret
I'm in the show.


249
00:20:16.178 --> 00:20:17.386
- Excuse me.
- Hello, sweetheart.


250
00:20:17.596 --> 00:20:19.221
- You look wonderful.
- Thank you.


251
00:20:19.431 --> 00:20:23.225
Hal, call a full dialogue rehearsal, will you?
Friday, for the full company.


252
00:20:23.435 --> 00:20:26.520
Sloppy diction. The original was in Greek,
but this is in English.


253
00:20:26.730 --> 00:20:30.900
Don't let us keep it a secret it's in English.
I want to catch the matinee tomorrow...


254
00:20:31.109 --> 00:20:33.736
...of Man in a Mousetrap.
- Can't do. We got a drama lecture...


255
00:20:33.945 --> 00:20:35.529
Never mind. We'll work it out somehow.

256
00:20:35.739 --> 00:20:37.740
Jeff, this is Tony Hunter.

257
00:20:37.949 --> 00:20:39.825
Yeah, I know. We just met.

258
00:20:41.745 --> 00:20:42.787
Mr. Hunter.

259
00:20:42.996 --> 00:20:44.830
- I beg your pardon.
- I'm glad to know you.


260
00:20:45.040 --> 00:20:46.207
So happy to meet you.

261
00:20:46.416 --> 00:20:49.168
You have no idea
how delighted I am to see you.


262
00:20:49.378 --> 00:20:51.128
- Delighted and thrilled.
- Thank you.


263
00:20:52.798 --> 00:20:55.091
We need our theater greats right here.

264
00:20:55.300 --> 00:20:58.719
So when Lily and Lester said they were
doing a show with Tony Hunter...


265
00:20:58.929 --> 00:21:00.763
...that's all I had to know.

266
00:21:00.972 --> 00:21:04.642
I'm dropping every other project,
and there are plenty, believe me.


267
00:21:05.477 --> 00:21:09.897
That's wonderful, Mr. Cordova,
but all this... The classics...


268
00:21:10.524 --> 00:21:14.527
- Do you really want to do a musical?
- Musical, musical!


269
00:21:14.736 --> 00:21:18.614
I'm sick of these artificial barriers
between the musical and the drama.


270
00:21:18.949 --> 00:21:22.535
In my mind, there is no difference
between the magic rhythms...


271
00:21:22.744 --> 00:21:26.414
...of Bill Shakespeare's immortal verse
and the magic rhythms...


272
00:21:26.623 --> 00:21:28.999
...of Bill Robinson's immortal feet.

273
00:21:29.668 --> 00:21:32.211
Hal, write that down.
I'll use it at Princeton.


274
00:21:32.421 --> 00:21:34.213
It's already down. 
You used it last week.

275
00:21:34.423 --> 00:21:36.966
I tell you, if it moves you,
if it stimulates you...


276
00:21:37.175 --> 00:21:39.260
...if it entertains you, it's theater.

277
00:21:39.469 --> 00:21:42.638
When the right combination gets together
and it spells theater...


278
00:21:42.848 --> 00:21:46.016
...I got to be right
in there up to my armpits.

279
00:21:46.685 --> 00:21:48.060
That's higher than usual.

280
00:21:48.270 --> 00:21:50.604
Now, that's what I wanted
Tony to hear you say.


281
00:21:50.814 --> 00:21:55.151
I tried to tell him how you feel, but I knew
that you could say it so beautifully.


282
00:21:55.360 --> 00:21:57.695
Lily, you splendid animal.

283
00:21:57.904 --> 00:22:00.739
Take your hands off my wife
and let's get down to business.


284
00:22:00.949 --> 00:22:03.951
Now I have here a script.
It's great. It's ready to roll.


285
00:22:04.161 --> 00:22:07.621
Jeff, I want you to take this home.
I want you to read it tonight...


286
00:22:07.831 --> 00:22:10.875
But before I do,
give me a rough idea of the plot.


287
00:22:11.084 --> 00:22:13.627
- Now?
- Throw it at me for a quick impression.


288
00:22:13.837 --> 00:22:15.713
- I'm dying to hear it.
- You tell it.


289
00:22:15.922 --> 00:22:18.048
- You do it so much better.
- Lester, honestly.


290
00:22:18.258 --> 00:22:20.718
- Please, Lily, tell them.
- Lester, honestly.


291
00:22:21.553 --> 00:22:25.556
With Tony in mind, we naturally
visualize a light and intimate show.


292
00:22:25.765 --> 00:22:29.643
We want to give him a chance to play
a charming guy, with just enough plot...


293
00:22:29.853 --> 00:22:32.730
...to make him do lots
of gay and varied numbers.


294
00:22:33.148 --> 00:22:36.484
He's a writer and illustrator
of children's books...


295
00:22:36.693 --> 00:22:38.152
...but to get in the real dough...

296
00:22:38.361 --> 00:22:41.322
...on the side,
he writes lurid murder mysteries...


297
00:22:41.531 --> 00:22:43.824
...full of violence and buckets of blood.

298
00:22:44.576 --> 00:22:47.244
The success of these
makes him feel he's sort of...


299
00:22:47.454 --> 00:22:50.039
...sold his soul to the devil,
but he keeps on doing it.


300
00:22:50.248 --> 00:22:53.459
There's lots of comedy implications
with his friends, played by us.


301
00:22:53.668 --> 00:22:56.295
- With his girl.
- I love this. Terrific possibilities.


302
00:22:56.505 --> 00:22:58.631
And some of the best numbers
we've ever written!


303
00:22:58.840 --> 00:23:02.968
Children's playground, a reform school,

304
00:23:03.178 --> 00:23:06.388
- And a number about a murder mystery!
- You two are the end.


305
00:23:06.640 --> 00:23:10.226
- Tony, I'm so glad!
- Some of the best lines we've written.


306
00:23:11.603 --> 00:23:13.604
What do you think, Jeff?

307
00:23:21.696 --> 00:23:23.572
Kids, you're geniuses.

308
00:23:23.782 --> 00:23:26.575
The whole thing
is a brilliantly imaginative idea.


309
00:23:26.785 --> 00:23:28.077
Why, Jeff!

310
00:23:28.286 --> 00:23:31.789
You've hit on something
that's not only great as a musical...


311
00:23:31.998 --> 00:23:34.708
...but valid in terms
of today, of modern life.

312
00:23:34.918 --> 00:23:36.627
Jeff, I'm so glad!

313
00:23:36.836 --> 00:23:40.381
Of course, these modern thrillers,
he's got to keep turning them out.


314
00:23:40.590 --> 00:23:42.466
They make him fame, money. He's caught.

315
00:23:42.676 --> 00:23:44.176
It's a funny situation.

316
00:23:44.386 --> 00:23:48.013
Of course! It's brilliant,
contemporary, perceptive.


317
00:23:48.265 --> 00:23:51.392
This story's a modern version of Faust.

318
00:23:52.978 --> 00:23:55.187
- Faust?
- You're kidding, Jeff.


319
00:23:56.273 --> 00:23:59.733
I guess I didn't tell it right.
I didn't bring out the point.


320
00:23:59.943 --> 00:24:04.113
But you did bring out the point admirably.
You used the phrase:


321
00:24:04.322 --> 00:24:06.657
"He sells his soul to the devil."

322
00:24:07.033 --> 00:24:10.202
Now, that's the line you have to follow
straight through.


323
00:24:10.453 --> 00:24:13.038
Just like Faust,
this man is tempted by the devil...


324
00:24:13.248 --> 00:24:17.626
...and his compromise, his sellout,
must end in eternal damnation.


325
00:24:18.295 --> 00:24:20.129
That'll leave them laughing.

326
00:24:20.338 --> 00:24:24.258
Kids, you've got a choice here
between a nice little musical comedy...


327
00:24:24.467 --> 00:24:27.177
...and a modern musical morality play...

328
00:24:27.387 --> 00:24:29.722
...with meaning and stature!

329
00:24:30.432 --> 00:24:34.101
- But we don't want to write Faust.
- You're taking me too literally.


330
00:24:34.311 --> 00:24:36.645
I want to do
your story. I love it!

331
00:24:36.980 --> 00:24:39.565
But I want to angle it
to bring out the analogy...


332
00:24:39.774 --> 00:24:42.443
...between the Faust legend
and this man's story.


333
00:24:43.028 --> 00:24:46.655
Won't this make it heavy?
Is this a box-office idea?


334
00:24:46.865 --> 00:24:48.157
Is Faust box-office?

335
00:24:48.366 --> 00:24:51.493
Listen, Faust by Christopher Marlowe,
Faust by Goethe, Faust by Gounod...


336
00:24:51.703 --> 00:24:52.953
...Faust by Hector Berlioz.

337
00:24:53.163 --> 00:24:57.041
I tell you, anyone who's touched this
legend has turned it into a gold mine.


338
00:24:57.250 --> 00:24:58.834
It's got to be a smash.

339
00:24:59.919 --> 00:25:02.671
It could still have all the fun in it,
couldn't it?


340
00:25:02.881 --> 00:25:06.717
- Yeah, and some stature thrown in.
- Now, kids, I'm happy about this.


341
00:25:07.010 --> 00:25:09.470
- Really happy.
- So are we, Jeff.


342
00:25:09.679 --> 00:25:11.013
This publisher you mentioned...

343
00:25:11.222 --> 00:25:14.058
...obviously, he could be
the counterpart of the devil.


344
00:25:18.855 --> 00:25:20.898
Evil personified!

345
00:25:21.524 --> 00:25:25.653
Leading all mankind
into the paths of temptation!


346
00:25:26.404 --> 00:25:29.823
- But nobody could play it like you.
- Nobody's going to.


347
00:25:30.033 --> 00:25:32.076
You mean you're going to play it?

348
00:25:32.410 --> 00:25:35.245
The part of the girl... 
Somebody fresh.

349
00:25:35.455 --> 00:25:39.166
Somebody with fire, charm, grace, beauty.
Gabrielle Gerard.


350
00:25:39.376 --> 00:25:42.670
- Gerard? She's a ballet dancer.
- She doesn't want to do a show.


351
00:25:42.879 --> 00:25:45.255
- She turns them all down.
- Nobody ever turns me down.


352
00:25:45.465 --> 00:25:48.175
Do you really think you could get her?
What a cast!


353
00:25:48.385 --> 00:25:52.888
Tony Hunter, Jeff Cordova,
Gabrielle Gerard! Tony! Isn't this exciting?


354
00:25:53.098 --> 00:25:54.264
Yeah.

355
00:25:54.683 --> 00:25:58.435
Now, look, this is going to be
a sort of modern Faust story.


356
00:25:59.104 --> 00:26:03.357
I play the Faust character. You play
the Devil. It'll have stature, importance.


357
00:26:03.775 --> 00:26:06.610
- I have to dance with this ballet dancer?
- She's wonderful.


358
00:26:06.820 --> 00:26:07.903
It'll be great.

359
00:26:08.113 --> 00:26:11.365
It'll be great for somebody.
I'll pick up my marbles and go home.


360
00:26:11.574 --> 00:26:14.368
Fellas, bless you and good luck,
but this just ain't for me.


361
00:26:14.577 --> 00:26:16.453
I know what I can do,
and I'm sticking to it.


362
00:26:16.663 --> 00:26:19.665
That's the trouble. You've stuck to it,
and you're stuck with it.


363
00:26:19.874 --> 00:26:22.292
- What?
- Nobody admires you more than I.


364
00:26:22.502 --> 00:26:25.504
I've seen every show
and every movie you've ever done...


365
00:26:25.714 --> 00:26:27.297
...but let's face some brutal facts.

366
00:26:27.507 --> 00:26:30.509
Times have changed, Tony.
You haven't changed with them.


367
00:26:30.719 --> 00:26:34.722
- You've gone stale.
- Then you certainly don't need me.


368
00:26:35.682 --> 00:26:37.057
Yes, we do!

369
00:26:37.267 --> 00:26:39.560
Because you can be greater
than you ever were!


370
00:26:39.769 --> 00:26:43.272
We are going to make you explode
on the theater scene like a skyrocket!


371
00:26:43.481 --> 00:26:46.400
Not just the old trademark,
with the top hat, tie, and tails...


372
00:26:46.609 --> 00:26:48.569
...but a great artist
at the peak of his powers.


373
00:26:48.778 --> 00:26:52.406
The new Tony Hunter. 
Tony Hunter, 1953!

374
00:26:52.615 --> 00:26:55.617
- But can I do it?
- It's a challenge to all of us...


375
00:26:55.827 --> 00:26:58.287
...but that's what the theater's about:
a challenge.


376
00:26:58.496 --> 00:27:00.748
Whatever I am,
whether it's a new me or an old me...


377
00:27:00.915 --> 00:27:02.624
...remember, I'm still just an entertainer.

378
00:27:02.834 --> 00:27:05.210
What do you think I am?
What do you think they are?


379
00:27:05.420 --> 00:27:07.963
What do you think the theater is?
It's all entertainment!


380
00:27:08.173 --> 00:27:11.175
Believe me, there is no difference
between the magic rhythms...


381
00:27:11.384 --> 00:27:13.969
...of Bill Robinson's immortal feet...
- You said that before.


382
00:27:14.179 --> 00:27:17.765
All right, what did Bill Robinson do?
He danced on the stairs, didn't he?


383
00:27:17.974 --> 00:27:20.517
Now I happen to play Oedipus the king
on the same stairs.


384
00:27:20.727 --> 00:27:23.187
What's the difference? 
We're all theater.

385
00:27:24.272 --> 00:27:25.814
Show me the greatest tragic actor...

386
00:27:26.024 --> 00:27:28.108
...or the lowest red-nosed comic
in burlesque...


387
00:27:28.318 --> 00:27:30.736
...and I'll show you an entertainer. We're all...

388
00:27:32.697 --> 00:27:34.698
Jeff, are you all right?

389
00:27:35.366 --> 00:27:37.826
Everything that happens in life

390
00:27:38.036 --> 00:27:40.412
Can happen in a show

391
00:27:40.997 --> 00:27:44.208
You can make 'em laugh
You can make 'em cry


392
00:27:44.626 --> 00:27:48.670
Anything, anything can go

393
00:27:51.382 --> 00:27:54.510
The clown with his pants falling down

394
00:27:54.719 --> 00:27:58.096
Or the dance that's a dream of romance

395
00:27:58.306 --> 00:28:02.309
Or the scene where the villain is mean

396
00:28:03.061 --> 00:28:05.646
That's entertainment

397
00:28:06.105 --> 00:28:09.149
The lights on the lady in tights

398
00:28:09.359 --> 00:28:12.986
Or the bride with
the guy on the side

399
00:28:13.196 --> 00:28:17.324
Or the ball where
she gives him her all

400
00:28:17.784 --> 00:28:20.369
That's entertainment!

401
00:28:20.954 --> 00:28:24.164
The plot can be hot
Simply teeming with sex


402
00:28:24.666 --> 00:28:27.668
A gay divorcée who is after her ex

403
00:28:28.962 --> 00:28:31.338
It could be Oedipus Rex

404
00:28:31.548 --> 00:28:35.467
Where a chap kills his father
And causes a lot of bother


405
00:28:35.677 --> 00:28:38.679
The clerk who is thrown out of work

406
00:28:38.888 --> 00:28:42.307
By the boss who
was thrown for a loss

407
00:28:42.517 --> 00:28:46.019
By the skirt who is doing him dirt

408
00:28:46.354 --> 00:28:48.355
The world is a stage

409
00:28:48.565 --> 00:28:52.317
The stage is a world of entertainment

410
00:29:05.456 --> 00:29:07.708
That's entertainment!

411
00:29:14.924 --> 00:29:16.592
All right!

412
00:29:19.804 --> 00:29:22.139
That's entertainment!

413
00:29:29.981 --> 00:29:31.773
Look what I can do.

414
00:29:40.867 --> 00:29:42.409
It's still me!

415
00:29:57.258 --> 00:30:00.344
The doubt while the jury is out

416
00:30:00.553 --> 00:30:03.931
Or the thrill when they're reading the will

417
00:30:04.140 --> 00:30:07.726
Or the chase for
the man with the face

418
00:30:08.853 --> 00:30:11.188
That's entertainment!

419
00:30:11.898 --> 00:30:14.816
The dame who is known as the flame

420
00:30:15.026 --> 00:30:18.487
Of the king of an underworld ring

421
00:30:18.696 --> 00:30:22.532
He's an ape who won't let her escape

422
00:30:23.534 --> 00:30:25.827
That's entertainment!

423
00:30:26.621 --> 00:30:29.706
It might be a fight
Like you see on the screen


424
00:30:30.333 --> 00:30:33.794
A swain getting slain
For the love of a queen


425
00:30:34.671 --> 00:30:39.299
Some great Shakespearean scene
Where a ghost and a prince meet


426
00:30:39.509 --> 00:30:41.134
And everyone ends in mincemeat

427
00:30:41.344 --> 00:30:44.346
The gag may be waving that flag

428
00:30:44.555 --> 00:30:48.016
That began with a Mr. Cohan

429
00:30:48.226 --> 00:30:51.979
Hip hooray, the American way

430
00:30:52.188 --> 00:30:53.939
The world is a stage

431
00:30:54.524 --> 00:30:59.695
The stage is a world of entertainment

432
00:31:03.199 --> 00:31:06.284
- You gone yet, Hal?
- I'm in here, Jeff, on the phone.


433
00:31:06.494 --> 00:31:08.996
Drama desk? Hello, Mike. It's Hal.

434
00:31:09.205 --> 00:31:12.624
You know that item Mr. Cordova sent you
about signing Gabrielle Gerard...


435
00:31:12.834 --> 00:31:13.875
...for the Marton show?

436
00:31:14.085 --> 00:31:17.546
There's been a mistake.
I wonder if there's still time to kill it.


437
00:31:17.755 --> 00:31:20.549
- Yeah. I'd appreciate it. Thanks, kid.
- Why did you do that?


438
00:31:20.758 --> 00:31:23.218
To save you from making an idiot
of yourself in print.


439
00:31:23.428 --> 00:31:25.721
- You know you can't get Gerard.
- Why?


440
00:31:25.930 --> 00:31:29.307
Because Paul Byrd won't let her
do a show. He's a tough customer.


441
00:31:29.517 --> 00:31:32.019
He's not only her choreographer,
he's also her boyfriend.


442
00:31:32.186 --> 00:31:33.603
She doesn't make a move without him.

443
00:31:35.023 --> 00:31:36.064
That will be Paul Byrd now.

444
00:31:36.274 --> 00:31:39.609
- It's 3 in the morning.
- Let him in, Hal, will you?


445
00:31:44.323 --> 00:31:45.741
- Hello, Paul.
- Where are they?


446
00:31:45.950 --> 00:31:47.409
He's in there.

447
00:31:47.785 --> 00:31:48.869
Hello, Paul.

448
00:31:49.078 --> 00:31:50.328
- Where is he?
- Who?


449
00:31:50.538 --> 00:31:52.998
- Oscar Hammerstein.
- Home in bed, I hope, at this hour.


450
00:31:53.207 --> 00:31:55.709
- Who is it? Dick Rodgers?
- What are you talking about?


451
00:31:55.918 --> 00:31:58.378
Didn't you say the greatest producer
of musicals today...


452
00:31:58.546 --> 00:31:59.880
...was here and wanted to see me?

453
00:32:00.089 --> 00:32:03.925
- That's me. I'm doing a musical.
- Did you get me out of bed...


454
00:32:07.722 --> 00:32:09.181
I see what this is all about.

455
00:32:09.390 --> 00:32:13.143
You needn't go any further because
the answer is no on Gabrielle Gerard.


456
00:32:13.352 --> 00:32:15.645
Gabrielle... Paul, 
I don't follow you.

457
00:32:15.855 --> 00:32:18.940
Gabrielle is not going to do a show.
She's too important to ballet.


458
00:32:19.150 --> 00:32:20.817
This has nothing to do with Gabrielle.

459
00:32:21.360 --> 00:32:25.530
Paul, I want you to do the choreography
for the greatest musical in years.


460
00:32:25.907 --> 00:32:27.824
Oh. Oh.

461
00:32:28.034 --> 00:32:30.077
- I'm sorry...
- That's why I wakened you, Paul.


462
00:32:30.286 --> 00:32:34.039
I'm so keyed up I just can't sleep.
You know how brilliant the Martons are.


463
00:32:34.248 --> 00:32:35.874
This time, they've excelled themselves.

464
00:32:36.084 --> 00:32:38.877
This show is a choreographer's dream,
and only you can do it.


465
00:32:39.087 --> 00:32:41.671
- I wouldn't say that.
- No time for false modesty.


466
00:32:41.881 --> 00:32:44.758
You're the greatest, and we know it.
This is just your meat.


467
00:32:44.967 --> 00:32:49.554
A great classic theme.
The story of Faust in a modern setting.


468
00:32:51.432 --> 00:32:54.226
Say, that sounds interesting.

469
00:32:54.435 --> 00:32:57.187
I've never been so excited
about a project in my life.


470
00:32:57.396 --> 00:33:00.982
Now, there's Tony Hunter, myself,
a great score by the Martons.


471
00:33:01.192 --> 00:33:03.443
Wonderful. My brain's beginning
to churn already.


472
00:33:03.653 --> 00:33:07.405
Good. Now we must comb the country
for a wonderful singer for the girl.


473
00:33:07.698 --> 00:33:11.284
Singer? Jeff, don't you think we ought
to stress the dancing in that role?


474
00:33:11.494 --> 00:33:12.619
No, Paul.

475
00:33:12.829 --> 00:33:17.374
This girl has to be a virtuoso performer,
with fire, charm, beauty...


476
00:33:17.583 --> 00:33:21.545
...a great lady with a gamine quality.
You know no dancer can give you that.


477
00:33:21.754 --> 00:33:25.674
Wait. Of course I wouldn't let her do it,
but Gabrielle has all that and more.


478
00:33:25.883 --> 00:33:29.010
Gabrielle? Paul, 
I feel a little embarrassed.

479
00:33:29.220 --> 00:33:32.013
I think she's charming,
within her limitations. Charming.


480
00:33:32.223 --> 00:33:33.849
She's a great artist, and you know it.

481
00:33:34.058 --> 00:33:37.435
- Sorry. I know how fond of her you are.
- That has nothing to do with it!


482
00:33:37.645 --> 00:33:39.896
She can be one of the greatest
stars in the theater.


483
00:33:40.106 --> 00:33:41.481
Everybody's been trying to get her.

484
00:33:41.691 --> 00:33:43.817
For the right vehicle,
something light and fluffy.


485
00:33:44.026 --> 00:33:45.569
Light and fluffy? Now, see here, Jeff.

486
00:33:45.778 --> 00:33:49.197
I'm not gonna do this show
unless Gabrielle Gerard plays that part!


487
00:33:49.407 --> 00:33:53.034
Now, Paul, this throws a little
monkey wrench into things, doesn't it?


488
00:33:53.244 --> 00:33:56.079
Never mind.
You and I will work together sometime...


489
00:33:56.289 --> 00:33:59.416
Wait. At least do this. You come
and see her in the ballet tomorrow.


490
00:33:59.625 --> 00:34:02.002
- Bring Hunter, bring the Martons.
- No. Impossible.


491
00:34:02.211 --> 00:34:04.713
I have a performance.
But I'll gladly send the Martons.


492
00:34:04.922 --> 00:34:08.341
We can get together afterwards and talk.
Mind you, I'm promising nothing.


493
00:34:08.551 --> 00:34:10.302
Good night, sweetie.

494
00:34:12.722 --> 00:34:13.889
Drama desk?

495
00:34:14.098 --> 00:34:17.601
Mike. Hal again.
Better print that item after all.


496
00:34:17.810 --> 00:34:22.147
And, Mike, after this, if Mr. Cordova tells
you he's casting Tallulah...


497
00:34:22.356 --> 00:34:24.900
...for Little Eva, believe him.

498
00:35:44.188 --> 00:35:45.230
Well?

499
00:35:45.439 --> 00:35:48.525
She's fabulous, sensational,
loveliest thing I've ever seen.


500
00:36:25.229 --> 00:36:26.980
A little tall, isn't she?

501
00:36:28.065 --> 00:36:29.607
Stage illusion.

502
00:37:06.312 --> 00:37:07.979
So you didn't care for it much?

503
00:37:08.189 --> 00:37:09.981
The girl's fantastic, beautiful...

504
00:37:10.191 --> 00:37:11.566
...but I can't dance with her.

505
00:37:11.776 --> 00:37:13.234
Stop worrying!

506
00:37:16.781 --> 00:37:19.491
It isn't that I don't appreciate
what she does.


507
00:37:19.700 --> 00:37:22.494
I tell you, I know she's magnificent.
That's what scares me.


508
00:37:22.703 --> 00:37:26.331
But I haven't done ballet
since I was a kid. I'd look silly.


509
00:37:26.665 --> 00:37:29.334
Hello, Lil. You look wonderful.
Put your things over there.


510
00:37:29.543 --> 00:37:30.835
Hello, Mr. Hunter. How are you?

511
00:37:31.045 --> 00:37:32.879
- Hello, Les. Glad to see you.
- How are you?


512
00:37:33.089 --> 00:37:35.298
What is this?
The annual fur trappers' convention?


513
00:37:35.508 --> 00:37:37.634
- The boss is inside with big money.
- His backers?


514
00:37:37.843 --> 00:37:40.178
- They're raising money for the show.
- What show, ours?


515
00:37:40.388 --> 00:37:42.180
- Sure.
- He hasn't read the script yet.


516
00:37:42.390 --> 00:37:44.015
- I better go back...
- Sorry, Mr. Marton.


517
00:37:44.225 --> 00:37:47.268
You disturb the water, you scare the fish.
They're biting tonight.


518
00:37:47.478 --> 00:37:49.979
- What's he telling them?
- Whatever it is, it's going over big.


519
00:37:50.147 --> 00:37:51.815
- Come on, Lil.
- Please don't go in yet.


520
00:37:51.982 --> 00:37:53.608
Wait here.
He's saving you for the finale.


521
00:37:55.069 --> 00:37:56.111
Excuse me.

522
00:37:56.320 --> 00:37:58.196
- Lester, isn't this wonderful?
- Yeah.


523
00:37:58.406 --> 00:38:00.573
- This is going to be great, Tony.
- Why?


524
00:38:00.783 --> 00:38:02.909
Cordova. The dough for the show.
No problems.


525
00:38:03.119 --> 00:38:05.412
How many times did we have to audition
the last time?


526
00:38:05.621 --> 00:38:07.455
- Fifty.
- A hundred, maybe more.


527
00:38:07.665 --> 00:38:11.626
Jeff might raise the backing tonight.
We'll be ready to rehearse in three weeks.


528
00:38:12.920 --> 00:38:14.796
- Hello, Hal.
- Hello, Paul. How are you?


529
00:38:15.005 --> 00:38:16.548
How nice to see you. 
Come right in.

530
00:38:16.757 --> 00:38:18.675
Hal, this is Miss Gerard. Mr. Benton.

531
00:38:18.884 --> 00:38:20.969
How do you do?
Jeff's inside with the backers.


532
00:38:21.178 --> 00:38:22.971
Why don't you wait in the library?

533
00:38:23.180 --> 00:38:24.597
- Excuse me.
- Thanks.


534
00:38:29.395 --> 00:38:30.437
Paul.

535
00:38:31.021 --> 00:38:33.231
Let's wait in here a minute, huh?

536
00:38:34.400 --> 00:38:36.651
Now, wait a second. 
I'm not ready yet.

537
00:38:36.861 --> 00:38:38.611
There's a lot to be cleared up first.

538
00:38:38.821 --> 00:38:41.156
This girl Gerard, it's not just her dancing.

539
00:38:41.365 --> 00:38:44.617
On top of everything, she's too tall for me.
This girl is a giantess.


540
00:38:44.827 --> 00:38:46.786
She's not too tall for you. 
I know this girl.

541
00:38:46.996 --> 00:38:49.080
She comes up to here,
maybe 2 inches shorter.


542
00:38:49.290 --> 00:38:51.541
You know I'm the perfect height for you.
Now look...


543
00:38:51.750 --> 00:38:54.043
...turn around. Measure. Look.
You see? Isn't that fine?


544
00:38:54.253 --> 00:38:59.048
Listen. Gabrielle Gerard in her
stocking feet is at the most 3-feet tall.


545
00:38:59.508 --> 00:39:03.344
Now relax. I'm going to find you a drink,
and you can stop worrying about her.


546
00:39:03.554 --> 00:39:06.139
Jeff only wants her in the show
because she's the best.


547
00:39:06.348 --> 00:39:08.683
We all gotta go along
with him too, Tony.


548
00:39:08.893 --> 00:39:10.935
In the show, one guy's got to be
at the helm...


549
00:39:11.145 --> 00:39:13.563
...and in Jeff, we got someone
we can trust to...


550
00:39:13.772 --> 00:39:17.275
...it is the Devil, come to claim the soul
of the modern Faust man.


551
00:39:17.485 --> 00:39:20.278
With flapping wings
and grinning evil eyes...


552
00:39:20.488 --> 00:39:23.239
...he points the way
to the yawning pits of Hades.


553
00:39:26.827 --> 00:39:27.952
Hallelujah.

554
00:39:29.163 --> 00:39:31.331
- I'm embarrassed.
- Don't be childish.


555
00:39:31.540 --> 00:39:33.958
I'm sure Tony Hunter doesn't want me
in this show.


556
00:39:34.168 --> 00:39:36.920
- What makes you say that?
- Did he come backstage to see me...


557
00:39:37.129 --> 00:39:38.171
...after the performance?

558
00:39:38.380 --> 00:39:40.173
He knew he was
going to meet you here.

559
00:39:40.382 --> 00:39:44.093
- I'm just a ballet dancer...
- You're a famous leading ballerina.


560
00:39:44.303 --> 00:39:47.514
What does he want with me?
He's a famous movie and stage actor.


561
00:39:47.723 --> 00:39:50.350
He's practically a historical character
by now.


562
00:39:50.559 --> 00:39:53.853
Dancing with him is like dancing
with a statue of General Grant.


563
00:39:54.063 --> 00:39:55.563
Now look, Gaby.

564
00:39:55.981 --> 00:39:59.484
You know, this is a Cordova show.
It's an important step for you.


565
00:39:59.693 --> 00:40:03.655
I'm going to do the choreography,
so there's nothing for you to worry about.


566
00:40:03.864 --> 00:40:06.658
But I still think he doesn't want me
in the show.


567
00:40:06.867 --> 00:40:08.201
Your nose is shiny.

568
00:40:08.410 --> 00:40:10.620
- Where's the, uh?
- Maybe this is it.


569
00:40:12.206 --> 00:40:16.918
He passes by all the writhing souls
in torment paying for their deadly sins.


570
00:40:17.127 --> 00:40:18.920
Gluttony, avarice...

571
00:40:20.881 --> 00:40:22.382
It must be upstairs.

572
00:40:40.150 --> 00:40:41.943
Lester, what have we got ourselves into?

573
00:40:42.152 --> 00:40:45.488
The story he's telling them has nothing
to do with the story we wrote.


574
00:40:45.698 --> 00:40:48.116
This will mean months of rewriting.

575
00:40:48.325 --> 00:40:51.536
He expects us to go into rehearsal
in three weeks?


576
00:40:55.791 --> 00:41:00.545
Brimstone and flames. Save me.

577
00:41:07.720 --> 00:41:12.557
Corrupter of children.
Purveyor of evil. Dungeon...


578
00:41:14.059 --> 00:41:18.479
...bubbling cauldrons.
Fiery furnaces of doom.


579
00:41:26.572 --> 00:41:28.948
- You're...
- And you're... How do you do?


580
00:41:29.158 --> 00:41:30.825
How do you do? 
It's certainly a...

581
00:41:31.035 --> 00:41:33.953
- We've been waiting for you in there.
- We just got here.


582
00:41:34.163 --> 00:41:36.372
We just got here ourselves,
about five minutes ago.


583
00:41:36.582 --> 00:41:38.583
A little early, I guess. Mr. 
Cordova's busy.

584
00:41:38.792 --> 00:41:41.210
Yes, I know, and I
rushed so to get here.

585
00:41:41.420 --> 00:41:43.880
- I'm a mess.
- No. You look wonderful.


586
00:41:45.424 --> 00:41:48.468
- Will you have a cigarette?
- No, thanks. I don't smoke.


587
00:41:48.677 --> 00:41:51.638
- Never?
- I don't think a dancer should smoke.


588
00:41:51.847 --> 00:41:52.972
I see.

589
00:41:54.099 --> 00:41:56.976
- Is anything wrong?
- No.


590
00:41:57.728 --> 00:41:59.771
- Pretty shoes.
- Thank you.


591
00:42:00.064 --> 00:42:01.648
You always wear high heels?

592
00:42:01.857 --> 00:42:04.317
No. Not always. 
Sometimes toe shoes.

593
00:42:04.818 --> 00:42:06.110
Toe shoes.

594
00:42:06.320 --> 00:42:08.154
I'm afraid I've been awfully rude.

595
00:42:08.364 --> 00:42:10.865
I haven't told you how wonderful
you were tonight.


596
00:42:11.075 --> 00:42:13.743
Thank you.
I'm a great admirer of yours too.


597
00:42:13.952 --> 00:42:16.621
- I didn't think you'd ever even heard of me.
- Heard of you?


598
00:42:16.830 --> 00:42:19.457
I used to see all your pictures
when I was a little girl.


599
00:42:19.667 --> 00:42:23.127
I'm still a fan. I recently went to see
a revival of them at the museum.


600
00:42:23.337 --> 00:42:24.379
Museum?

601
00:42:24.588 --> 00:42:26.339
"Step right this way,
ladies and gentlemen.


602
00:42:26.548 --> 00:42:28.341
"Egyptian mummies, extinct reptiles...

603
00:42:28.550 --> 00:42:31.177
...and Tony Hunter,
the grand old man of the dance."


604
00:42:31.387 --> 00:42:32.428
I didn't mean...

605
00:42:32.638 --> 00:42:36.474
I want you to know that I can still
thread a needle without my eyeglasses...


606
00:42:36.684 --> 00:42:39.394
...and still occasionally do
a soft-shoe shuffle.


607
00:42:39.603 --> 00:42:41.062
Nothing balletic, of course.

608
00:42:41.271 --> 00:42:43.064
You're not a ballet devotee, are you?

609
00:42:43.273 --> 00:42:45.775
Yes. I was going to the ballet
before you were born.


610
00:42:45.984 --> 00:42:49.028
I saw Pavlova, Karsavina,
all the real ballet greats.


611
00:42:49.238 --> 00:42:51.823
You don't see dancing like that nowadays.
I'm sorry.


612
00:42:52.032 --> 00:42:54.575
That's okay. I don't expect you
to class me with Pavlova.


613
00:42:54.785 --> 00:42:55.952
In fact, if she were around...

614
00:42:56.161 --> 00:42:58.287
...I doubt if she'd be good enough
to dance with you.


615
00:42:58.497 --> 00:43:00.456
You'd probably insist on an audition first.

616
00:43:00.666 --> 00:43:03.292
I sure would.
I'd audition my own grandmother.


617
00:43:03.502 --> 00:43:07.004
Then why don't you audition mine?
She'd be just about right for you.


618
00:43:07.214 --> 00:43:09.257
- I'm terribly sorry.
- No, you're not.


619
00:43:09.466 --> 00:43:10.842
- No, I'm not.
- Neither am I.


620
00:43:11.051 --> 00:43:12.093
Good.

621
00:43:16.807 --> 00:43:19.517
- Paul, I'm leaving.
- What's the matter, darling?


622
00:43:19.727 --> 00:43:21.769
I can't work with that man.
He's impossible.


623
00:43:21.979 --> 00:43:23.563
We just got here. 
It'll look funny...

624
00:43:23.772 --> 00:43:26.357
The whole thing is off.
This girl is a monster.


625
00:43:26.567 --> 00:43:28.443
I have definitely had it.

626
00:43:29.903 --> 00:43:33.948
And now, ladies and gentlemen,
the brains, the talent, the artists.


627
00:43:34.575 --> 00:43:36.993
Wonderful. Aren't they wonderful?

628
00:43:43.417 --> 00:43:45.585
You have no idea
how well things are going.


629
00:43:45.794 --> 00:43:47.503
It's really wonderful.

630
00:43:48.589 --> 00:43:50.381
Ladies and gentlemen.

631
00:43:50.591 --> 00:43:52.884
I want you all to meet
the happy little group...


632
00:43:53.051 --> 00:43:54.510
...that's responsible for the show...

633
00:43:54.720 --> 00:43:57.847
...that everyone will be clamoring
to get seats for next season.


634
00:43:58.056 --> 00:44:00.683
The celebrated choreographer Paul Byrd.

635
00:44:03.228 --> 00:44:07.315
The authors you know:
Lily and Lester Marton.


636
00:44:07.524 --> 00:44:09.192
Take a bow, Lily.

637
00:44:09.818 --> 00:44:11.694
And, ladies and gentlemen...

638
00:44:11.904 --> 00:44:14.030
...my star, Tony Hunter.

639
00:44:14.239 --> 00:44:17.658
A name, a talent.
Mr. Show Business himself.


640
00:44:20.370 --> 00:44:23.539
And, ladies and gentlemen,
his new leading lady.


641
00:44:23.749 --> 00:44:27.710
That glamorous, delightful dancer
from the magical world of ballet.


642
00:44:27.920 --> 00:44:31.923
Mr. Hunter's own personal choice,
Gabrielle Gerard.


643
00:44:34.426 --> 00:44:38.012
I think, gentlemen, you will agree
your investment is safe, yes?


644
00:44:38.222 --> 00:44:41.015
Now let's relax and
have a drink, shall we?

645
00:44:42.601 --> 00:44:46.521
My dear, how do you authors
ever think of these brilliant ideas?


646
00:44:46.730 --> 00:44:49.816
That damnation scene.
Did you ever in your life hear...


647
00:44:50.025 --> 00:44:53.986
My boy. I had the pleasure
of backing your last show too.


648
00:44:54.404 --> 00:44:57.156
Jeffrey. How about?

649
00:45:12.464 --> 00:45:14.924
There it is, folks. 
The work light.

650
00:45:15.133 --> 00:45:17.969
Only an electric bulb, perhaps,
but for the next four weeks...


651
00:45:18.178 --> 00:45:20.930
...that will be our
sun, our moon, our stars.

652
00:45:21.139 --> 00:45:24.433
These four walls will be our universe,
our private world.


653
00:45:24.643 --> 00:45:27.770
We enter with nothing but a dream,
but when we leave...


654
00:45:27.980 --> 00:45:29.564
...we'll have a show.

655
00:45:29.773 --> 00:45:34.026
In between, there will be enthusiasms,
frustrations, hot tempers...


656
00:45:34.236 --> 00:45:35.444
...ha, ha, cold coffee.

657
00:45:35.654 --> 00:45:38.155
Some of us will
fight, some fall in love...

658
00:45:38.365 --> 00:45:40.741
...but all of us
will work and adore it...

659
00:45:40.951 --> 00:45:43.786
...because all of us are inspired
by the same thing.


660
00:45:43.996 --> 00:45:47.707
The night that curtain goes up,
it will go up on a smash hit.


661
00:45:47.916 --> 00:45:49.792
And believe me, kids...

662
00:45:50.043 --> 00:45:53.004
...there's nothing in the world as soothing...

663
00:45:53.213 --> 00:45:55.131
...as a smash hit.

664
00:46:47.935 --> 00:46:50.978
What do you think this is,
summer stock or something?


665
00:47:12.376 --> 00:47:13.417
Go!

666
00:47:14.920 --> 00:47:19.215
That's it. That's wonderful.
Why didn't you do it before?


667
00:47:19.424 --> 00:47:20.800
Good, men.

668
00:47:21.009 --> 00:47:23.552
Honey, would you try
that cross, please, again for me?


669
00:47:23.762 --> 00:47:26.889
"The same kind of opportunistic snake
that he is."


670
00:47:27.140 --> 00:47:29.850
"You got me wrong. 
I'm a self-made snake.

671
00:47:30.060 --> 00:47:33.312
"Listen, baby, we all live by the jungle:
Eat or be eaten.


672
00:47:33.522 --> 00:47:37.566
"I just realized that I like to eat,
and to eat caviar whenever possible.


673
00:47:37.776 --> 00:47:39.819
"Anything wrong with that?"

674
00:47:40.153 --> 00:47:42.822
"Anything wrong with that?" A bad line.

675
00:47:43.031 --> 00:47:47.493
What we need is some quick image,
like "spreading ideals on a cracker."


676
00:47:47.703 --> 00:47:50.538
You all like that?
"Ever try spreading ideals on a cracker?"


677
00:47:50.747 --> 00:47:52.081
Let me hear it, Tony.

678
00:47:52.290 --> 00:47:54.583
Did you ever try spreading ideals
on a cracker?


679
00:47:54.793 --> 00:47:57.545
- Jeff. I don't...
- Honey, just try that cross again for me.


680
00:47:57.754 --> 00:48:00.881
"The same kind of opportunistic snake
that he is."


681
00:48:01.508 --> 00:48:04.093
"You got me wrong. 
I'm a self-made snake.

682
00:48:04.302 --> 00:48:07.013
"Listen, baby.
We all live by the law of the jungle..."


683
00:48:07.222 --> 00:48:09.015
- Excuse me, Tony.
- "...eat or be eaten."


684
00:48:09.224 --> 00:48:10.808
Pardon me, folks.

685
00:48:17.899 --> 00:48:19.608
You know about icebergs, don't you?

686
00:48:19.818 --> 00:48:22.653
One-eighth above the surface,
seven-eighths below. That's you.


687
00:48:22.863 --> 00:48:25.740
You're giving me only that one-eighth.
I'm greedy. I want more.


688
00:48:25.949 --> 00:48:27.616
All eight-eighths. Now let it rip, Tony.

689
00:48:27.826 --> 00:48:31.912
Give it too much. Go way over.
Come along. The whole eight-eighths!


690
00:48:32.205 --> 00:48:33.497
Okay, Gaby. Same place.

691
00:48:33.707 --> 00:48:35.833
"The same kind of opportunistic snake
that he is."


692
00:48:36.043 --> 00:48:37.960
You got me wrong. 
I'm a self-made snake!

693
00:48:38.170 --> 00:48:41.297
Listen, baby. We all live by
the law of the jungle: Eat or be eaten!


694
00:48:41.506 --> 00:48:45.176
And I realized that I like to eat,
and eat caviar whenever possible.


695
00:48:45.385 --> 00:48:48.137
Did you ever try spreading ideals
on a cracker?


696
00:48:48.346 --> 00:48:51.098
Good boy, Tony. That's it. 
Eight-eighths.

697
00:49:03.528 --> 00:49:05.988
- Sorry. Butterfingers.
- No. It's not your fault, Tony.


698
00:49:06.198 --> 00:49:08.115
It's an awkward pattern.
I have a better idea.


699
00:49:08.325 --> 00:49:10.493
You hold your position right here,
and Jimmy...


700
00:49:10.702 --> 00:49:13.996
...suppose you pick up Gaby like that,
and put her down...


701
00:49:14.206 --> 00:49:16.248
...right here next to Tony?
Now you see, Tony...


702
00:49:16.458 --> 00:49:18.667
I'd like to practice it with her
two or three times.


703
00:49:18.877 --> 00:49:19.919
I think I could handle it.

704
00:49:20.128 --> 00:49:21.796
Do you mind if
he tries it with Barbara?

705
00:49:22.005 --> 00:49:23.798
These are new toe shoes.
They're killing me.


706
00:49:24.007 --> 00:49:26.509
Sure. You go ahead and rest.
Barbara, come here. Try it.


707
00:49:26.718 --> 00:49:28.719
I think this is what's throwing you off.

708
00:49:28.929 --> 00:49:32.014
If you hold your balance so, like this,
then grab her here by the...


709
00:49:32.224 --> 00:49:34.975
Paul, I think we're making a mistake here.

710
00:49:38.647 --> 00:49:40.481
I think we're wasting Tony in this scene.

711
00:49:40.690 --> 00:49:43.818
He's got the first-act finale right after this.
The damnation scene.


712
00:49:44.027 --> 00:49:46.028
I don't want to dissipate
his impact in that.


713
00:49:46.238 --> 00:49:50.407
Now, why not let him exit into the house
and watch it from his balcony?


714
00:49:50.617 --> 00:49:52.034
- How'd that be?
- Wonderful idea.


715
00:49:52.244 --> 00:49:54.620
See what that would do?
Save your sock for the finale.


716
00:49:54.830 --> 00:49:55.913
Much better that way.

717
00:49:56.123 --> 00:49:58.290
Let's go back
to the beginning positions. Gaby.


718
00:49:58.500 --> 00:50:00.376
Boys, get around up here,
and the girls, yes.


719
00:50:00.585 --> 00:50:03.045
You were down here in the line like that.
Not too close.


720
00:50:03.255 --> 00:50:04.964
This group's down here,
you're up there.


721
00:50:05.173 --> 00:50:06.799
- Let's try it this way.
- No!


722
00:50:07.008 --> 00:50:09.844
Let's not try it this
way or any other way.

723
00:50:11.596 --> 00:50:15.641
I have had enough. I've had
three weeks of these lovely rehearsals...


724
00:50:15.851 --> 00:50:19.228
...three weeks of Chinese torture.
I don't know what you're trying to do...


725
00:50:19.437 --> 00:50:22.022
...except make me look like a complete fool.
A clumsy idiot.


726
00:50:22.232 --> 00:50:25.442
I've tried. For three weeks, I've tried.
I've taken everything.


727
00:50:25.652 --> 00:50:29.196
I've watched my part being changed,
my numbers being cut out day after day...


728
00:50:29.364 --> 00:50:30.531
...and I haven't said a word.

729
00:50:30.740 --> 00:50:33.075
Got to be cooperative,
think of the good of the show.


730
00:50:33.285 --> 00:50:35.202
Let's get this straight:

731
00:50:35.579 --> 00:50:39.165
I am not Nijinsky. 
I am not Marlon Brando.

732
00:50:39.374 --> 00:50:42.710
I am Mrs. Hunter's little boy, Tony,
song-and-dance man.


733
00:50:42.919 --> 00:50:45.838
I'm supposed to have entertained
millions of people in my time.


734
00:50:46.047 --> 00:50:50.759
And I am not entertained by
this little ballerina's snide insinuations...


735
00:50:50.969 --> 00:50:52.720
...that I am a no-talent hoofer.

736
00:50:52.929 --> 00:50:55.848
I am sick of her superior smirk.
I'm sick of her.


737
00:50:56.057 --> 00:50:59.894
I'm sick of Faust. I am sick of this show.
Never mind saying it!


738
00:51:00.103 --> 00:51:02.855
Tony Hunter, 1953.

739
00:51:03.315 --> 00:51:05.691
I hereby declare my independence.

740
00:51:05.901 --> 00:51:09.111
Tony Hunter, 1776.

741
00:51:09.487 --> 00:51:10.821
Bless you.

742
00:51:25.670 --> 00:51:28.380
- Lester, where are you going?
- I don't know. I was...


743
00:51:28.590 --> 00:51:32.718
What's happening to us? Let's try
to keep our heads. It's only a show.


744
00:51:32.928 --> 00:51:34.595
I know. I'm sorry, baby.

745
00:51:34.804 --> 00:51:37.848
So am I. Let's try
to be sensible about it.

746
00:51:38.058 --> 00:51:41.852
- Do you think we should try to find Tony?
- I don't know. What do you think?


747
00:51:42.062 --> 00:51:44.230
- Maybe we should.
- But Jeff said not to.


748
00:51:44.439 --> 00:51:46.982
And, of course,
you mustn't disobey teacher.


749
00:51:47.192 --> 00:51:50.152
Right or wrong,
someone has got to be at the helm.


750
00:51:50.362 --> 00:51:52.821
But to you, he's
100 percent right every time.

751
00:51:53.031 --> 00:51:56.408
If you say one more word to me
about Jeff's hypnotic influence on me...


752
00:51:56.618 --> 00:51:58.452
...I'll scream.
- He's got you so bulldozed...


753
00:52:00.038 --> 00:52:01.747
Someone's liable to think we're quarreling.

754
00:52:01.915 --> 00:52:03.999
We're not quarreling.
We're in complete agreement.


755
00:52:04.209 --> 00:52:05.918
- We hate each other.
- Unh!


756
00:52:16.596 --> 00:52:20.808
Joe, tell Mrs. 
Marton I've gone to Tahiti...

757
00:52:21.393 --> 00:52:22.643
...to paint.

758
00:52:56.761 --> 00:53:00.097
- Hello, Mr. Hunter.
- You must have the wrong apartment.


759
00:53:00.307 --> 00:53:03.434
No. I came to see you.
May I come in a minute?


760
00:53:03.643 --> 00:53:04.810
Please.

761
00:53:06.229 --> 00:53:09.940
I, uh, was just about to slip
into my bed of nails.


762
00:53:13.737 --> 00:53:14.778
Oh.

763
00:53:16.072 --> 00:53:17.406
I'm terribly sorry.

764
00:53:17.615 --> 00:53:21.535
That's all right. You couldn't have done it
if I hadn't softened it up for you.


765
00:53:21.745 --> 00:53:23.203
- What?
- Nothing.


766
00:53:24.164 --> 00:53:25.581
- Cigarette?
- No, thanks.


767
00:53:25.790 --> 00:53:27.916
That's right. Dancers shouldn't smoke.

768
00:53:28.126 --> 00:53:30.919
- You mind if I do?
- Yes. I mean, it's all right.


769
00:53:31.129 --> 00:53:32.296
Thanks.

770
00:53:36.176 --> 00:53:37.509
How lovely.

771
00:53:38.511 --> 00:53:41.472
I've never seen such wonderful prints
in a hotel.


772
00:53:41.681 --> 00:53:44.725
They don't belong to the hotel yet.
They're mine, and they're originals.


773
00:53:44.934 --> 00:53:45.976
Oh.

774
00:53:46.186 --> 00:53:47.269
Don't let that throw you.

775
00:53:47.479 --> 00:53:51.440
I don't know any more about art than I do
about dancing. I'm just a Hollywood actor.


776
00:53:51.649 --> 00:53:53.859
I call my agent and say,
"I've got a wall to cover.


777
00:53:54.069 --> 00:53:57.529
"Send me over 20 feet's worth of paintings
in assorted colors."


778
00:53:59.240 --> 00:54:01.784
That's a very early Degas, isn't it?

779
00:54:02.786 --> 00:54:04.620
"1877."

780
00:54:06.373 --> 00:54:10.125
Yeah. I swiped it from his desk in school.
Was he sore.


781
00:54:13.380 --> 00:54:14.630
What can I do for you?

782
00:54:14.839 --> 00:54:18.133
I know. You demand an apology.
Okay, let's cut it short. I apologize.


783
00:54:18.343 --> 00:54:21.428
No, don't do that.
I'm supposed to apologize to you.


784
00:54:22.013 --> 00:54:23.138
- Oh...
- I mean...


785
00:54:23.348 --> 00:54:26.016
I see, the fellows got together,
stuck a gun in your back...


786
00:54:26.226 --> 00:54:29.228
No, it was all my idea.
I just wanted to tell you that...


787
00:54:29.437 --> 00:54:31.563
All right. It was Paul's idea.

788
00:54:31.773 --> 00:54:33.565
Why do I let him push me around?

789
00:54:33.775 --> 00:54:36.360
What do I want to apologize
to you for anyway?


790
00:54:36.569 --> 00:54:38.320
You've been mean to me.

791
00:54:38.530 --> 00:54:41.740
You didn't want me in the show
in the first place.


792
00:54:41.950 --> 00:54:42.991
What?

793
00:54:43.201 --> 00:54:45.661
And you think
I'm a dime-a-dozen ballet dancer.


794
00:54:45.870 --> 00:54:46.912
No.

795
00:54:47.122 --> 00:54:50.541
And this whole thing's making me
a nervous wreck and no show is worth it.


796
00:54:50.750 --> 00:54:53.752
I wouldn't apologize to you
in a million years.


797
00:54:53.962 --> 00:54:58.048
Now, don't do that. Please, just
calm down. Now take it easy. Look.


798
00:54:58.258 --> 00:55:00.843
I thought I was the only nervous wreck
around here...


799
00:55:01.052 --> 00:55:02.845
...and all this time you've been behaving...

800
00:55:03.054 --> 00:55:05.681
I've behaved horribly to
you, and I know it.

801
00:55:05.890 --> 00:55:09.726
I'm not used to behaving horribly.
It's a big strain.


802
00:55:10.728 --> 00:55:14.106
You just misunderstood me, that's all.
I think you're terrific.


803
00:55:14.315 --> 00:55:17.860
I think everything in the show
is probably terrific, except me.


804
00:55:18.069 --> 00:55:20.279
I've been scared to death of you...

805
00:55:20.488 --> 00:55:23.740
...and scared to death
of every last kid in the chorus.


806
00:55:26.953 --> 00:55:28.787
Don't be nice to me.

807
00:55:29.873 --> 00:55:32.916
It just makes me seem twice as ugly.

808
00:55:36.296 --> 00:55:39.840
I'd say you were more plain than ugly...

809
00:55:40.175 --> 00:55:42.885
...but at least you've got talent.
- Thanks.


810
00:55:43.636 --> 00:55:45.804
Now look, Gaby. 
It's just plain silly...

811
00:55:46.014 --> 00:55:48.223
...that we have never sat down
and talked this out.


812
00:55:48.433 --> 00:55:51.518
We are the only animals given
the greatest means of communication...


813
00:55:51.728 --> 00:55:52.769
...human speech.

814
00:55:52.979 --> 00:55:56.190
- And all we do is snarl at each other.
- I know.


815
00:55:56.399 --> 00:55:59.234
We're from two different worlds,
two eras...


816
00:55:59.444 --> 00:56:02.404
...but yet we're supposed
to dance together, work together.


817
00:56:02.614 --> 00:56:04.156
No one consulted us...

818
00:56:04.365 --> 00:56:07.493
...but we're the only things that matter
in this whole thing.


819
00:56:07.827 --> 00:56:11.163
Not those geniuses out there,
telling us what to do.


820
00:56:11.664 --> 00:56:15.167
You're right.
We have to do the performing.


821
00:56:15.710 --> 00:56:18.170
We're the ones
that have to get up on that stage...


822
00:56:18.379 --> 00:56:22.716
...and make idiots out of ourselves.
- Tony, is that what's going to happen?


823
00:56:22.926 --> 00:56:25.928
No. Of course not.
Things are going to be fine.


824
00:56:26.137 --> 00:56:29.556
I have a feeling that everything
is going to be much better from now on.


825
00:56:29.766 --> 00:56:31.475
Yes, I know, but...

826
00:56:33.186 --> 00:56:35.729
Can you and I really dance together?

827
00:56:36.606 --> 00:56:38.065
I don't know.

828
00:56:39.192 --> 00:56:40.692
Let's find out.

829
00:56:46.032 --> 00:56:47.991
- Taxi, sir?
- Yes, please.


830
00:56:53.665 --> 00:56:55.624
- El Morocco, please.
- No.


831
00:56:56.334 --> 00:56:57.459
Stork? Waldorf?

832
00:56:57.669 --> 00:57:00.170
No. I'm not dressed.
I just came from rehearsal.


833
00:57:00.380 --> 00:57:03.090
- I can't go to any of those places.
- You look fine to me.


834
00:57:03.299 --> 00:57:05.509
- Never mind. Thanks.
- Thank you.


835
00:57:11.224 --> 00:57:14.226
- Where to, sir?
- Leave it to the horse.


836
00:57:23.945 --> 00:57:25.737
Look, trees.

837
00:57:26.447 --> 00:57:29.408
Yes, I remember now, dimly. Trees.

838
00:57:30.368 --> 00:57:32.494
And isn't that called grass?

839
00:57:33.371 --> 00:57:35.414
And, look, there's the sky.

840
00:57:36.249 --> 00:57:37.708
This has all been here...

841
00:57:37.917 --> 00:57:41.295
...the whole time we have been
shut up in our little sweatbox of the arts.


842
00:57:41.504 --> 00:57:43.255
Really? Amazing.

843
00:57:43.715 --> 00:57:47.009
Do you know what those are
on those benches? People.


844
00:57:47.343 --> 00:57:48.427
Happy people.

845
00:57:48.636 --> 00:57:50.554
Would you believe it?
They don't even care...


846
00:57:50.763 --> 00:57:54.057
...whether we have a damnation scene
in our show or not.


847
00:57:55.560 --> 00:57:57.019
Neither do I.

848
01:02:41.178 --> 01:02:42.971
You can't get it into the elevators.

849
01:02:43.180 --> 01:02:46.641
And you take this one here,
and it won't fit the finale.


850
01:02:46.851 --> 01:02:49.269
- How are we doing?
- It's a disaster.


851
01:02:49.478 --> 01:02:52.439
We're in terrible trouble.
We just can't open in three days.


852
01:02:52.648 --> 01:02:56.192
I told you from the beginning,
you are overloading the show.


853
01:02:56.402 --> 01:02:58.653
You can't get all this scenery
in the theater.


854
01:02:58.863 --> 01:03:01.698
- Why isn't this hung?
- We've been hanging all night.


855
01:03:01.908 --> 01:03:04.242
You've got more scenery in this show...

856
01:03:04.452 --> 01:03:06.536
...than there is in Yellowstone National Park.

857
01:03:06.746 --> 01:03:09.497
Never mind. Get your blueprints.
We'll go have a conference.


858
01:03:09.707 --> 01:03:12.125
Everything will work out all right.

859
01:03:17.006 --> 01:03:20.258
Hold it. I scored for brass,
and all I hear is flute.


860
01:03:20.468 --> 01:03:22.052
I don't want so many long bows.

861
01:03:22.261 --> 01:03:25.221
Lester, I gotta cut 16 bars
out of that dance.


862
01:03:25.806 --> 01:03:27.682
Sixteen bars! Hey, Lil.

863
01:03:28.225 --> 01:03:31.019
All right, I'll make
the cut. Page to page.

864
01:03:31.228 --> 01:03:33.605
Would you ask Lily
if she approves the cut?


865
01:03:33.814 --> 01:03:36.066
- Lil, how about this cut?
- It's fine.


866
01:03:36.275 --> 01:03:37.901
Okay, Lester. Let's give it to her.

867
01:03:38.110 --> 01:03:41.279
This'll sound like hash.
I better put some chords in for transition.


868
01:03:41.489 --> 01:03:44.658
Wait, just a minute.
Sublime, time, dime, slime...


869
01:03:44.867 --> 01:03:46.868
You can't hear Tony in Lovelier Than You.

870
01:03:47.078 --> 01:03:50.664
- I'm already holding down the orchestra.
- Maybe the key's too low.


871
01:03:51.374 --> 01:03:53.625
Ask Lester if Tony can
take it a key higher.

872
01:03:53.834 --> 01:03:55.710
About Lovelier Than You,
Les, a key higher?


873
01:03:55.920 --> 01:03:58.505
Don't you see I'm trying to make a cut?
The key's perfect.


874
01:03:58.714 --> 01:04:02.050
- But Lily said you'd make the change.
- The key is...


875
01:04:05.429 --> 01:04:08.056
Everyone on their toes
for the transformation scene.


876
01:04:08.265 --> 01:04:10.934
- We're not ready.
- Perfectly all right. Next.


877
01:04:11.143 --> 01:04:13.186
Watch it.
I'll cue you for the transition music.


878
01:04:13.396 --> 01:04:14.980
Isn't it great? Herman.

879
01:04:15.189 --> 01:04:16.940
Everybody ready back there?

880
01:04:17.149 --> 01:04:19.192
We got to have more time
to make the change.


881
01:04:19.402 --> 01:04:22.821
- I've got to have 16 more men.
- I got elevators...


882
01:04:23.030 --> 01:04:24.072
Do the best you can.

883
01:04:24.281 --> 01:04:25.865
All right, everybody. This is it.

884
01:04:26.075 --> 01:04:28.827
Men in the elevators,
watch the signal lights for your cues.


885
01:04:29.036 --> 01:04:32.080
Switchboards. Stand by to come down
your number one batten on cue.


886
01:04:32.289 --> 01:04:35.125
Girls on stairs, take your positions,
but don't be frightened.


887
01:04:35.334 --> 01:04:37.502
Men in armor, light your chandeliers.

888
01:04:37.712 --> 01:04:41.923
All right, make this great, everybody.
Don't forget, it's the first-act finale.


889
01:04:43.551 --> 01:04:46.261
Are you guys all right in there?
Now, watch your cue.


890
01:04:47.513 --> 01:04:48.888
Light change.

891
01:04:49.098 --> 01:04:50.265
Revolve.

892
01:04:54.895 --> 01:04:57.147
This is going to be beautiful.

893
01:04:57.565 --> 01:05:00.108
It will be a memorable moment.

894
01:05:00.484 --> 01:05:01.818
Memorable.

895
01:05:02.445 --> 01:05:03.695
Ah, yes.

896
01:05:03.904 --> 01:05:05.822
This is real theater.

897
01:05:06.032 --> 01:05:09.534
Everything's smooth as silk.

898
01:05:12.163 --> 01:05:16.833
No, Herman, that doesn't go up,
it goes down. Take it down.


899
01:05:17.668 --> 01:05:19.627
What is this? Herman!

900
01:05:20.296 --> 01:05:22.922
I don't think
you've got your cues right!


901
01:05:23.132 --> 01:05:24.674
No, stop!

902
01:05:25.176 --> 01:05:29.304
That one doesn't go down, it goes up.
Take it up.


903
01:05:30.765 --> 01:05:33.600
For heaven's sake, look at your cue sheet.

904
01:05:35.811 --> 01:05:39.939
Take it up. No, not me.

905
01:05:40.900 --> 01:05:43.943
Herman, this cable has fouled.

906
01:05:57.958 --> 01:05:59.751
Calm down. Don't let us lose our heads.

907
01:05:59.960 --> 01:06:02.629
This is a setback,
but that's what we come out of town for.


908
01:06:02.838 --> 01:06:03.880
We'll never make it work.

909
01:06:04.090 --> 01:06:07.383
Of course it will. You boys get together,
think of something brilliant.


910
01:06:07.593 --> 01:06:10.720
You can't put Gaby on that thing.
It's dangerous. I won't allow it.


911
01:06:10.930 --> 01:06:13.848
It's all right. After all, we expected
to strike a snag or two.


912
01:06:14.058 --> 01:06:16.810
Get the full company in the lounge
for dialogue rehearsal...


913
01:06:17.019 --> 01:06:20.647
...while they're clearing the stage.
We can't afford to waste a moment.


914
01:06:38.541 --> 01:06:41.209
Here. I'm sorry. I forgot.

915
01:06:47.591 --> 01:06:49.050
That help?

916
01:06:49.969 --> 01:06:51.469
All right?

917
01:06:54.807 --> 01:06:56.766
If you've quite finished, let's try this.

918
01:06:56.976 --> 01:06:59.519
We're going to get the stage soon.
You don't know it yet.


919
01:06:59.728 --> 01:07:04.357
Paul, I'm afraid Gaby's kind of beat.
Nobody's had any sleep for two nights.


920
01:07:04.567 --> 01:07:05.900
Can't you let her rest a while?

921
01:07:06.110 --> 01:07:08.778
If you don't mind, Tony,
I've worked with her for many years.


922
01:07:08.988 --> 01:07:11.322
I happen to know her a good deal
better than you do.


923
01:07:11.532 --> 01:07:12.782
All right, Gaby. Come on.

924
01:07:12.992 --> 01:07:14.492
Madame, may I have this dance?

925
01:07:14.702 --> 01:07:17.662
Cut the clowning. It's not going to seem
so funny tomorrow night.


926
01:07:17.872 --> 01:07:19.205
All right, Adam.

927
01:07:28.549 --> 01:07:32.093
Okay, Paul, they're ready for you on-stage.
Come on.


928
01:07:37.141 --> 01:07:40.894
This is the big moment.
Hal, come on. Take it over there.


929
01:07:41.103 --> 01:07:45.148
Tony, Gaby, this is it.
I want it to be outstanding.


930
01:07:45.524 --> 01:07:50.653
It must be beautiful, fabulous,
warm, and fiery.


931
01:07:54.074 --> 01:07:56.951
Your cue is, "Dance, fools, dance!"

932
01:07:58.746 --> 01:08:04.459
You and the night and the music

933
01:08:04.627 --> 01:08:07.045
Fill me with flaming desire

934
01:08:10.591 --> 01:08:15.386
Setting my being completely

935
01:08:15.554 --> 01:08:21.184
On fire, fire, fire

936
01:08:21.352 --> 01:08:24.062
You and the night and the music

937
01:08:26.690 --> 01:08:30.026
Thrill me but will we

938
01:08:30.194 --> 01:08:32.445
Be one

939
01:08:33.822 --> 01:08:37.700
After the night and the music

940
01:08:37.868 --> 01:08:42.247
Are done?

941
01:08:42.414 --> 01:08:45.667
Until the pale light

942
01:08:45.834 --> 01:08:48.544
Of dawning and daylight

943
01:08:48.712 --> 01:08:53.049
Our hearts will be throbbing guitars

944
01:08:56.345 --> 01:09:00.265
Hal, it seems to be a little too much,
doesn't it?


945
01:09:01.433 --> 01:09:02.684
Yes.

946
01:09:04.687 --> 01:09:07.689
Are we really supposed
to open tomorrow night?


947
01:09:13.237 --> 01:09:15.530
"Dance, fools, dance!"

948
01:09:37.803 --> 01:09:40.513
Hello, there! It's a big night.

949
01:09:42.766 --> 01:09:46.060
Everybody is here from New York.
Simply everybody.


950
01:09:46.270 --> 01:09:49.188
Do you hear that, my dear?
Everybody from New York is here.


951
01:09:50.065 --> 01:09:52.775
Come on. Don't want you
to miss the overture.


952
01:09:53.694 --> 01:09:55.528
Think we should get ready, boys?

953
01:09:55.738 --> 01:09:58.906
No, we can finish this hand.
Nobody's made a pep talk yet.


954
01:09:59.366 --> 01:10:00.450
Pep talk?

955
01:10:01.035 --> 01:10:03.828
Yeah. I never seen an opening night yet
without some guy...


956
01:10:04.038 --> 01:10:07.623
...gets all the poor actors together
and makes them a long speech:


957
01:10:07.833 --> 01:10:09.542
"They should be brilliant."

958
01:10:09.877 --> 01:10:12.378
On-stage, please. 
Everybody on-stage.

959
01:10:14.840 --> 01:10:16.716
Mr. Cordova wants to say
a few words.


960
01:10:16.925 --> 01:10:20.261
Come on, girls. Hurry up. Let's go.
Step right along.


961
01:10:26.685 --> 01:10:30.521
Company, a final word.
You've all been just wonderful.


962
01:10:30.731 --> 01:10:32.231
Thanks for your cooperation.

963
01:10:32.441 --> 01:10:35.401
Tonight, we're about to perform
before an audience in a theater.


964
01:10:35.611 --> 01:10:38.321
It's not only a temple of the arts,
but a place of business.


965
01:10:38.530 --> 01:10:41.699
And I feel we have here a venture
that is successful on both counts.


966
01:10:41.909 --> 01:10:45.161
Nothing to be nervous about.
We've got to keep our wits and do a show.


967
01:10:45.371 --> 01:10:47.747
There will be rough spots,
but we'll smooth them out.


968
01:10:47.956 --> 01:10:50.375
Remember, that's what
we came out of town for.


969
01:10:50.584 --> 01:10:53.503
Up to now,
I've been giving you orders as director...


970
01:10:54.088 --> 01:10:57.507
...but when next you see me,
I shall be just as one of you...


971
01:10:57.716 --> 01:11:00.468
...an eager ham, anxious to make good.

972
01:11:01.053 --> 01:11:03.846
Actors, let's go.

973
01:11:04.056 --> 01:11:06.474
All right, people.
Get ready for the tableau, girls.


974
01:11:06.683 --> 01:11:09.268
Finish your make-up.
Come on, girls. Let's go.


975
01:11:10.979 --> 01:11:12.897
I'm so glad you folks could come.

976
01:11:13.107 --> 01:11:16.025
And don't forget the big party
at the hotel after the show.


977
01:11:16.235 --> 01:11:18.444
The whole cast will be there.
You'll meet them all.


978
01:11:18.654 --> 01:11:21.656
Of course, I have to go backstage
to congratulate them afterwards.


979
01:11:23.117 --> 01:11:25.326
I'll see you all at the party.

980
01:11:25.536 --> 01:11:27.328
All New York is here.

981
01:11:28.247 --> 01:11:30.164
Big party at the hotel after the show.

982
01:11:30.374 --> 01:11:33.709
I'll look for you. Big party, big show.
Come on, now.


983
01:11:35.796 --> 01:11:38.714
We don't want to miss a thing.
Now, don't forget the party.


984
01:11:38.924 --> 01:11:42.510
Evelyn, big party at the hotel
after the show.


985
01:11:42.719 --> 01:11:44.303
I'll look for you.

986
01:11:45.764 --> 01:11:47.432
Champagne's on me.

987
01:12:33.479 --> 01:12:36.647
Shall I drive you to the hotel, sir,
to the party?


988
01:12:38.108 --> 01:12:39.317
No. Drive me to the station.

989
01:12:39.526 --> 01:12:42.320
Maybe I can still make the 11:40
back to New York.


990
01:12:42.529 --> 01:12:43.738
Yes, sir.

991
01:13:16.021 --> 01:13:19.565
- Good evening.
- I was looking for The Band Wagon party.


992
01:13:19.775 --> 01:13:21.317
This is it, sir.

993
01:13:39.795 --> 01:13:41.796
This way, please.

994
01:14:14.288 --> 01:14:17.081
- Are you leaving, sir?
- Yes. Good night.


995
01:14:18.917 --> 01:14:21.043
We must do this more often.

996
01:14:25.424 --> 01:14:30.636
Oh, give me something
To remember you by


997
01:14:32.598 --> 01:14:37.101
When you are far away from me

998
01:14:39.938 --> 01:14:41.897
Some little something

999
01:14:42.107 --> 01:14:43.941
It's all Annie's fault.

1000
01:14:45.110 --> 01:14:47.945
I should have listened to my mother.
She told me only to be in hit shows.


1001
01:14:51.992 --> 01:14:53.534
Hi, I don't want to barge in.

1002
01:14:53.744 --> 01:14:56.203
I just want to tell you all
how great I think you are.


1003
01:14:56.413 --> 01:14:58.247
I didn't get a chance
to know you very well.


1004
01:14:58.457 --> 01:15:03.252
- I'm sorry I messed up the show for you.
- Wait a minute, come on in, have a drink.


1005
01:15:03.462 --> 01:15:06.505
- I don't want to crash the party.
- Give Mr. Hunter a drink.


1006
01:15:06.715 --> 01:15:09.300
- What do you say, Scotch, rye, or beer?
- Beer's fine.


1007
01:15:09.509 --> 01:15:12.178
- One beer, coming up.
- Want some pizza pie?


1008
01:15:12.387 --> 01:15:15.264
How about a sandwich?
We've got ham and deviled egg.


1009
01:15:15.474 --> 01:15:17.391
I've had enough of both for one night.

1010
01:15:23.357 --> 01:15:27.652
Far away
Me, oh, my


1011
01:15:27.861 --> 01:15:31.572
Only yesterday

1012
01:15:35.535 --> 01:15:38.412
There we were, the whole act,
the 10 Tapping Troubadours.


1013
01:15:38.622 --> 01:15:40.581
The 10 Tapping Troubadours?

1014
01:15:40.791 --> 01:15:42.083
Yeah, believe it or not...

1015
01:15:42.292 --> 01:15:44.585
...we were stranded in Pittsburgh
with $3 between us...


1016
01:15:44.795 --> 01:15:47.755
...crammed into one room
the size of that closet.


1017
01:15:49.049 --> 01:15:52.134
Gaby, come on in.
We're having a good old-fashioned wake.


1018
01:15:53.387 --> 01:15:55.054
I've been looking all over for you.

1019
01:15:55.263 --> 01:15:56.305
Where is Paul?

1020
01:15:56.515 --> 01:15:59.350
He's at a very exclusive wake
with Jeff and the Martons.


1021
01:15:59.559 --> 01:16:01.727
Can I get you a drink, Gaby?
How about a beer?


1022
01:16:01.937 --> 01:16:03.771
How about some popcorn?

1023
01:16:03.980 --> 01:16:05.398
Tony!

1024
01:16:06.858 --> 01:16:08.859
Lily, Lester, come on in.

1025
01:16:09.695 --> 01:16:12.947
Are you sure? Don't you remember?
We wrote that thing.


1026
01:16:13.156 --> 01:16:15.741
This is a wonderful party. Come on in.

1027
01:16:16.368 --> 01:16:19.620
Who's going to go out and get the beer?
Okay, Sis, you're elected.


1028
01:16:19.830 --> 01:16:21.706
Tony, watch this!

1029
01:16:24.418 --> 01:16:25.793
More beer!

1030
01:16:26.920 --> 01:16:29.255
I'll never forget.
You blew a gasket.


1031
01:16:29.464 --> 01:16:31.632
You were really gone. Come on.

1032
01:16:34.720 --> 01:16:36.554
Come on, Tony. 
Come on, get with it.

1033
01:16:37.973 --> 01:16:40.141
How I love the glass of beer

1034
01:16:40.350 --> 01:16:41.976
More beer

1035
01:16:42.561 --> 01:16:47.189
- Beer goes very good with beer
- More beer


1036
01:16:47.399 --> 01:16:52.027
When I'm drinking beer I'm thinking
"Ach, life is dear"


1037
01:16:52.237 --> 01:16:57.074
But there's someone I love
Even more than beer


1038
01:16:58.827 --> 01:17:03.289
I love Louisa
Louisa loves me


1039
01:17:03.707 --> 01:17:08.169
When we rode on the merry-go-round
I kissed Louisa


1040
01:17:08.378 --> 01:17:12.423
And then Louisa
Louisa kissed me


1041
01:17:12.966 --> 01:17:17.428
We were so happy
So happy and free


1042
01:17:17.721 --> 01:17:21.891
Ach! Ach! But she's a
Beautiful Louisa


1043
01:17:22.058 --> 01:17:24.018
Ach! When I choose 'em

1044
01:17:24.227 --> 01:17:26.645
I never want to lose 'em

1045
01:17:26.855 --> 01:17:31.317
Someday Louisa
Louisa will be


1046
01:17:31.526 --> 01:17:34.487
More als just a Fräulein to me

1047
01:17:38.325 --> 01:17:42.536
- Frenchmen love a glass of wine
- More beer


1048
01:17:42.746 --> 01:17:47.166
- The English think the whiskey's fine
- More beer


1049
01:17:47.375 --> 01:17:51.754
But when I comb off all the foam off
I drink a toast


1050
01:17:51.963 --> 01:17:54.673
To the Germans and the Mädchen

1051
01:17:54.883 --> 01:17:58.344
I love most

1052
01:18:16.947 --> 01:18:21.367
Ach! Ach! But she's a
Beautiful Louisa


1053
01:18:21.576 --> 01:18:26.205
Ach! When I choose 'em
I never want to lose 'em


1054
01:18:43.849 --> 01:18:48.143
Ach! Ach! But she's a
Beautiful Louisa


1055
01:18:48.353 --> 01:18:52.523
Ach! When I choose 'em
I never want to lose 'em


1056
01:18:52.732 --> 01:18:56.944
Someday Louisa
Louisa will be


1057
01:18:57.153 --> 01:19:00.239
More than just a Fräulein to me

1058
01:19:00.448 --> 01:19:04.660
More beer!
More beer!


1059
01:19:04.870 --> 01:19:08.539
More beer!

1060
01:19:24.222 --> 01:19:27.808
Gosh, with all this raw talent around,
why can't us kids get together...


1061
01:19:28.018 --> 01:19:29.351
...and put on ourselves a show?

1062
01:19:29.561 --> 01:19:33.314
Maybe we can find ourselves
a barn or something, and maybe...


1063
01:19:36.902 --> 01:19:39.403
I could stand anything but failure.

1064
01:19:40.822 --> 01:19:43.240
- Where's the telephone?
- In there.


1065
01:19:50.749 --> 01:19:53.292
Give me Jeff Cordova's room, please.

1066
01:19:54.461 --> 01:19:57.922
Hello, Jeff. This is Tony.
Now, don't say anything. Just listen.


1067
01:19:58.131 --> 01:20:00.674
I'm here with all the kids,
and we've come to a decision.


1068
01:20:00.884 --> 01:20:04.678
We're not closing this show,
if you can call it a show. We're going on.


1069
01:20:04.888 --> 01:20:08.182
We're going to keep it on the road
and redo it from top to bottom.


1070
01:20:08.391 --> 01:20:10.184
It won't be a modern version of Faust...

1071
01:20:10.393 --> 01:20:12.937
...Pilgrim's Progress, or the Book of Job
in swing time.


1072
01:20:13.146 --> 01:20:15.773
It'll be our show,
the show we started out to do...


1073
01:20:15.982 --> 01:20:18.525
...the book the Martons wrote,
with the songs you threw out.


1074
01:20:18.735 --> 01:20:21.570
It'll have laughs and entertainment.
You remember entertainment?


1075
01:20:21.780 --> 01:20:23.697
Look, we'd love to
have you with us, Jeff.

1076
01:20:23.907 --> 01:20:25.950
But if you're not,
it won't make any difference.


1077
01:20:26.159 --> 01:20:27.534
We're going ahead just the same.

1078
01:20:27.744 --> 01:20:30.579
We're going to put this thing across,
aren't we, kids?


1079
01:20:30.789 --> 01:20:32.164
All right. What do you say?

1080
01:20:32.374 --> 01:20:33.958
Hello? Nobody here.

1081
01:20:34.167 --> 01:20:37.127
This is the chambermaid, but if you want...

1082
01:20:37.337 --> 01:20:40.422
...I'll leave a message for Mr. Cordova.
- Thank you, madam.


1083
01:20:40.966 --> 01:20:42.383
He isn't in.

1084
01:20:53.895 --> 01:20:56.313
Jeff, did you hear what I said?

1085
01:20:57.983 --> 01:21:01.318
Tony, I've learned one thing in the theater,
and it's this:


1086
01:21:01.528 --> 01:21:04.780
one man has to be at the helm,
the rest take orders.


1087
01:21:05.657 --> 01:21:09.410
I believe in what you said.
I got carried away in the wrong direction.


1088
01:21:09.619 --> 01:21:14.331
You've got to be the boss, Tony.
I think you can pull this off brilliantly...


1089
01:21:15.583 --> 01:21:17.918
...and I'd like to
be a part of it.

1090
01:21:20.005 --> 01:21:21.088
Jeff, you're all right.

1091
01:21:21.297 --> 01:21:23.424
I must tell you one thing.
There isn't any money.


1092
01:21:23.633 --> 01:21:26.760
Colonel Todd and the backers
have stolen away into the night.


1093
01:21:26.970 --> 01:21:28.012
- We've got backers.
- Who?


1094
01:21:28.221 --> 01:21:30.305
A bunch of painters.
A fellow named Degas from...


1095
01:21:30.515 --> 01:21:33.434
- You wouldn't sell your paintings.
- Sure, they love the theater.


1096
01:21:33.643 --> 01:21:37.604
I figure we need five or six weeks on tour
to do what we have to do with this show.


1097
01:21:37.814 --> 01:21:40.232
- Jeff, would you help us with bookings?
- Of course.


1098
01:21:40.442 --> 01:21:43.736
Hal, have you got paper and pencil?
We can send a telegram.


1099
01:21:46.114 --> 01:21:48.198
- Washington? Washington's open.
- And Boston.


1100
01:21:48.408 --> 01:21:49.450
Boston's very good.

1101
01:21:49.659 --> 01:21:52.828
Can we go to Philadelphia, Detroit,
then come on back to New York?


1102
01:21:53.038 --> 01:21:56.665
- Paul, aren't you excited?
- Yeah. It's wonderful.


1103
01:21:57.709 --> 01:21:59.710
I wish them a lot of luck.

1104
01:22:01.212 --> 01:22:04.548
- This kind of leaves us out.
- Why?


1105
01:22:05.008 --> 01:22:08.177
With Tony doing the dances,
it's not going to be my kind of show.


1106
01:22:08.386 --> 01:22:11.138
Yours, either. 
I don't want you to do it.

1107
01:22:12.891 --> 01:22:15.142
I wouldn't think of leaving the show, Paul.

1108
01:22:15.351 --> 01:22:20.064
- I've worked too hard on your career to...
- It's my career, and I want to stay.


1109
01:22:21.775 --> 01:22:24.902
I'm taking the 9:00 train
tomorrow morning for New York.


1110
01:22:25.111 --> 01:22:27.071
I expect you to be there.

1111
01:22:28.823 --> 01:22:30.741
Have a nice trip, Paul.

1112
01:22:36.039 --> 01:22:38.665
Dancers, singers, the sketches.

1113
01:22:42.712 --> 01:22:46.006
Listen, kids,
it's going to mean rehearsing every day...


1114
01:22:46.424 --> 01:22:48.509
...all day, right up to curtain time.

1115
01:22:48.718 --> 01:22:51.970
We're going to put in new numbers,
and learn them as fast as we can...


1116
01:22:52.180 --> 01:22:54.973
...and we're going to
yank out all that junk.

1117
01:22:56.434 --> 01:22:59.812
We've got our schedule all worked out,
and it looks pretty good now.


1118
01:23:00.021 --> 01:23:03.023
Philadelphia, Boston, Pittsburgh...

1119
01:23:03.233 --> 01:23:05.526
...Washington, Baltimore...

1120
01:23:21.417 --> 01:23:26.296
I see a new sun
up in a new sky

1121
01:23:26.506 --> 01:23:31.135
And my whole horizon
Has reached a new high


1122
01:23:31.761 --> 01:23:36.348
Yesterday my heart sang a blue song

1123
01:23:36.558 --> 01:23:41.353
But today hear it
hum a cheery new song

1124
01:23:41.563 --> 01:23:46.275
I dreamed a new dream
I saw a new face


1125
01:23:46.484 --> 01:23:51.363
And I'm spreading sunshine
All over the place


1126
01:23:51.573 --> 01:23:56.451
With a new point of view
Here's what greets my eye


1127
01:23:57.203 --> 01:23:59.329
- New love
- New love


1128
01:23:59.539 --> 01:24:01.540
- New luck
- New luck


1129
01:24:01.749 --> 01:24:06.420
- New sun
- And there's a new sun


1130
01:24:06.629 --> 01:24:11.550
In the sky

1131
01:24:21.019 --> 01:24:24.938
I guess I'll have to change my plan

1132
01:24:25.982 --> 01:24:30.110
I should've realized
There'd be another man


1133
01:24:30.653 --> 01:24:34.990
I overlooked that point completely

1134
01:24:35.491 --> 01:24:39.745
Until the big affair began

1135
01:24:40.246 --> 01:24:43.999
Before I knew where I was at

1136
01:24:45.126 --> 01:24:49.171
I found myself up on the shelf
And that was that


1137
01:24:49.923 --> 01:24:54.718
I tried to reach the moon
But when I got there


1138
01:24:55.845 --> 01:24:59.097
All that I could get was the air

1139
01:24:59.307 --> 01:25:03.393
My feet are back upon the ground

1140
01:25:04.103 --> 01:25:08.941
I've lost the one girl I found

1141
01:26:15.800 --> 01:26:18.719
Get goin', Louisiana hayride

1142
01:26:18.928 --> 01:26:23.765
Get goin', we all is ready
Start somethin', Louisiana hayride


1143
01:26:24.017 --> 01:26:26.184
No use for callin' the roll

1144
01:26:26.394 --> 01:26:29.438
Oh, I like that sport
Sittin' in the hay


1145
01:26:29.647 --> 01:26:31.773
Lovin' it away, oh, oh

1146
01:26:31.983 --> 01:26:34.985
For the time is short
Crack your little whip


1147
01:26:35.194 --> 01:26:37.195
Get your little ship to go

1148
01:26:37.780 --> 01:26:40.741
Start somethin', 
Louisiana hayride

1149
01:26:40.950 --> 01:26:45.787
No foolin', we all is happy
Get goin', Louisiana hayride


1150
01:26:46.164 --> 01:26:48.290
No use for callin' the roll

1151
01:26:48.791 --> 01:26:51.335
- Jasmine Washington
- I is here


1152
01:26:51.544 --> 01:26:54.129
- Sweet Pea Oglethorpe
- I is here


1153
01:26:54.339 --> 01:26:56.757
- Jonquil Jezebel
- Here


1154
01:26:56.966 --> 01:26:59.426
- Lemon Verbena
- I is here


1155
01:26:59.635 --> 01:27:02.387
Mo and Freddy
Lily and Lettie


1156
01:27:02.597 --> 01:27:05.140
We is here
We all here


1157
01:27:05.350 --> 01:27:10.228
- Zeke and Lemuel, Hiram and Samuel
- We is here, we all here


1158
01:27:10.438 --> 01:27:13.065
- Primrose Paradise
- I am here


1159
01:27:13.274 --> 01:27:15.567
- Daisy Dandelion
- I is here


1160
01:27:15.777 --> 01:27:18.653
We all here
We all here


1161
01:27:18.863 --> 01:27:19.905
Can't you see?

1162
01:27:20.114 --> 01:27:22.866
If you is really ready
And you're goin' steady


1163
01:27:23.076 --> 01:27:25.619
Get goin', Louisiana hay

1164
01:27:25.828 --> 01:27:29.623
Louisiana hayride

1165
01:27:29.832 --> 01:27:34.503
Start something, Louisiana hay
And no use to call, no use to call


1166
01:27:34.712 --> 01:27:38.382
- It's no use
- No use to bother to call the roll


1167
01:27:38.591 --> 01:27:40.342
Get goin', get goin'

1168
01:27:40.551 --> 01:27:45.806
I like that sport, sittin' in the hay
Lovin' it away, ow, ow


1169
01:27:46.015 --> 01:27:49.768
The time is short, crack your little whip
Get your little ship


1170
01:27:49.977 --> 01:27:54.231
- Get your little ship
- Get your little ship to go


1171
01:27:54.440 --> 01:27:57.317
Get goin'
Louisiana hayride


1172
01:27:57.527 --> 01:28:01.988
Clear the way
Watch out, kindly step aside


1173
01:28:02.490 --> 01:28:05.909
Get goin'

1174
01:28:06.119 --> 01:28:13.125
Louisiana hayride

1175
01:28:22.260 --> 01:28:26.847
The scene's only about two minutes.
You won't have time to make the change.


1176
01:28:28.850 --> 01:28:32.144
I know it's a rough deal,
but we won't make New York if we don't.


1177
01:28:32.353 --> 01:28:36.231
- As much rehearsal time as possible.
- Better call them at 10:00.


1178
01:28:36.899 --> 01:28:40.735
Don't forget, everybody.
Rehearsal, 10:00 on the dot, Baltimore.


1179
01:28:40.945 --> 01:28:44.489
That case is important.
Tell you what we'll do, when we start.


1180
01:28:44.699 --> 01:28:46.741
Say, who's the pretty girl?

1181
01:28:47.201 --> 01:28:49.703
Why, this couldn't be
the mousy little Miss Gerard.


1182
01:28:49.912 --> 01:28:53.415
You've been with the firm for years.
I've never seen you with glasses on.


1183
01:28:53.624 --> 01:28:57.335
Say, you are beautiful. How are you, Gaby?

1184
01:28:57.545 --> 01:28:59.921
- I'm all right. Thanks.
- Good.


1185
01:29:02.008 --> 01:29:03.091
Oh!

1186
01:29:06.762 --> 01:29:08.096
I'm sorry.

1187
01:29:08.973 --> 01:29:12.100
- You must be tired.
- Yes, I am, a little.


1188
01:29:12.685 --> 01:29:15.854
- Bet you are too.
- A little.


1189
01:29:22.737 --> 01:29:26.156
Lester, look, I've got a problem
with these two numbers.


1190
01:29:26.365 --> 01:29:29.034
The murder mystery has a jazz beat
and I don't want it to...


1191
01:29:29.243 --> 01:29:33.705
- Anyone heard from Paul Byrd?
- No, I haven't heard.


1192
01:29:33.915 --> 01:29:37.042
As a matter of fact, nobody has.
At least they haven't mentioned it.


1193
01:29:37.251 --> 01:29:39.461
- Wasn't he going to...
- What a rat.


1194
01:29:39.670 --> 01:29:42.339
Rat? Lester, wait a second.

1195
01:29:43.341 --> 01:29:46.218
He's a wonderful guy,
wonderful and talented.


1196
01:29:46.427 --> 01:29:49.930
He's written... Listen, don't sell him short.
That boy has got a lot...


1197
01:29:50.139 --> 01:29:53.808
He may be a little young, yes.
He needs a little more experience.


1198
01:29:54.018 --> 01:29:56.269
- Just give him a few more years.
- Yeah.


1199
01:29:56.479 --> 01:29:59.481
Probably when he settles down
and gets married.


1200
01:30:01.108 --> 01:30:05.487
- You think he'll make a good husband?
- And how. Great.


1201
01:30:05.696 --> 01:30:07.739
He'll make a great husband. Sure.

1202
01:30:07.949 --> 01:30:09.574
Listen, this kid is solid.

1203
01:30:09.784 --> 01:30:12.661
He knows all... 
It isn't gonna be easy. No.

1204
01:30:12.870 --> 01:30:17.415
Marriage and the theater and two careers.
Problems. It isn't all skittles.


1205
01:30:17.625 --> 01:30:20.293
- It's no bed of...
- Is that why you never got married?


1206
01:30:20.503 --> 01:30:25.298
Who, me? You know, 
I'm the kind of fella...

1207
01:30:25.508 --> 01:30:29.010
You got the right slant.
You're pretty happy as you are.


1208
01:30:29.470 --> 01:30:32.556
I like to kick around
and have a lot of laughs.


1209
01:30:44.986 --> 01:30:47.821
Lester, I'm very much
in love with this girl.

1210
01:30:48.030 --> 01:30:52.784
It's ridiculous, I know,
things being as they are, but there it is.


1211
01:30:54.704 --> 01:30:57.789
Look, Tony, uh,
I don't know what the chances are...


1212
01:30:58.124 --> 01:31:01.001
...but wait till we get to New York,
and see how you stand.


1213
01:31:01.210 --> 01:31:03.545
Personally, I think the girl's crazy
about you...


1214
01:31:03.754 --> 01:31:08.216
...but what you can see in a beautiful,
young and talented girl is beyond me.


1215
01:31:30.197 --> 01:31:31.865
Three little unexpected children

1216
01:31:32.074 --> 01:31:33.617
Simultaneously the doctor brought us

1217
01:31:33.826 --> 01:31:36.828
And you can see that
We'll be three forever and A


1218
01:31:37.038 --> 01:31:40.957
E, I, O, You wouldn't know how agonizing
Being triple can be


1219
01:31:41.167 --> 01:31:44.753
Each one is individually the victim
Of the clinical day


1220
01:31:44.962 --> 01:31:49.549
E, I, O, Every summer we go away
To Baden-Baden-Baden


1221
01:31:49.759 --> 01:31:53.011
Every winter we come back home
To Walla Walla Walla


1222
01:31:55.056 --> 01:31:58.058
We do everything alike
We look alike


1223
01:31:58.267 --> 01:31:59.851
We dress alike
We walk alike


1224
01:32:00.061 --> 01:32:01.686
We talk alike
And what is more


1225
01:32:01.896 --> 01:32:05.357
We hate each other very much
We hate our folks


1226
01:32:05.566 --> 01:32:08.902
We're sick of jokes
On what an art it is to tell us apart


1227
01:32:09.111 --> 01:32:12.489
- If one of us gets the measles
- Another one gets the measles


1228
01:32:12.698 --> 01:32:15.784
Then all of us gets the measles
And mumps and croup


1229
01:32:16.327 --> 01:32:19.663
How I wish I had a gun
A wittle gun


1230
01:32:19.872 --> 01:32:23.583
It would be fun to shoot the other two
And be only one!


1231
01:32:25.336 --> 01:32:28.797
Mrs. Wifflepoofer loves
To talk to Mrs. Hildendorfer


1232
01:32:29.006 --> 01:32:32.509
Of the fatal natal day
She had her silly Willy


1233
01:32:32.718 --> 01:32:36.054
Mrs. Hassencooper loves to talk
To Mrs. Goldenwasser


1234
01:32:36.263 --> 01:32:39.641
Of her major operation
When she had her twins


1235
01:32:39.850 --> 01:32:43.228
But when Mother comes along
She silences the others


1236
01:32:43.437 --> 01:32:47.023
She accomplished something
That is very rare in mothers


1237
01:32:47.233 --> 01:32:50.568
MGM has got a Leo
But Mama has got a trio


1238
01:32:50.778 --> 01:32:53.321
She is proud
But says three is a crowd


1239
01:32:54.448 --> 01:32:58.493
We do everything alike
We look alike, we dress alike


1240
01:32:58.703 --> 01:33:01.121
We walk alike, we talk alike
And what is more


1241
01:33:01.330 --> 01:33:03.373
We hate each other very much

1242
01:33:03.582 --> 01:33:05.625
We hate our folks
We're sick of jokes


1243
01:33:05.835 --> 01:33:08.294
On what an art it
is to tell us apart

1244
01:33:08.504 --> 01:33:10.088
We eat the same kind of vittles

1245
01:33:10.297 --> 01:33:13.550
We drink the same kind of bottles
We sit in the same kind of highchair


1246
01:33:13.759 --> 01:33:15.468
Highchair, highchair

1247
01:33:30.526 --> 01:33:33.111
Oh, I wish I had
a gun, a wittle gun

1248
01:33:33.320 --> 01:33:40.326
It would be fun to shoot the other two
And be only one


1249
01:34:10.399 --> 01:34:13.485
- It's raining cats and dogs.
- A rainy opening is good luck...


1250
01:34:13.694 --> 01:34:15.987
...when it rains on opening night.

1251
01:34:16.405 --> 01:34:18.364
Good luck, Tony.

1252
01:34:18.574 --> 01:34:22.160
Sweetie, I just want to say that no matter
what happens tonight, it's been...


1253
01:34:22.369 --> 01:34:24.120
I know. It's been that for me too.

1254
01:34:24.330 --> 01:34:27.499
If this turns out to be a hit,
you'll get sick of the sight of me...


1255
01:34:27.708 --> 01:34:30.502
...six nights a week, two matinees.
No escape.


1256
01:34:30.711 --> 01:34:33.630
Course, if it isn't,
you won't have to see me at all.


1257
01:34:35.591 --> 01:34:38.009
Gaby, I've been wanting
to ask you something.


1258
01:34:38.219 --> 01:34:42.597
It's been...
I felt there's been an obstacle between us.


1259
01:34:43.265 --> 01:34:46.768
I wanted to... 
Is Paul coming tonight?

1260
01:34:47.228 --> 01:34:50.104
- Why, I think so.
- I see.


1261
01:34:50.439 --> 01:34:52.899
What I wanted to ask...

1262
01:34:55.444 --> 01:34:56.945
Perhaps, I better not.

1263
01:34:57.154 --> 01:34:59.113
I wish you wouldn't, Tony.

1264
01:35:00.825 --> 01:35:04.702
- Tony, good luck tonight.
- Good luck, Gaby.


1265
01:35:12.211 --> 01:35:17.131
I see a new sun
up in a new sky

1266
01:35:17.299 --> 01:35:20.844
- If one of us gets the measles
- Another one gets the measles


1267
01:35:21.011 --> 01:35:22.971
Then all of us gets the measles

1268
01:35:23.597 --> 01:35:25.932
Get goin', Louisiana hayride

1269
01:35:26.141 --> 01:35:28.601
Get goin', we all is ready

1270
01:36:06.181 --> 01:36:09.225
The city was asleep.
The joints were closed.


1271
01:36:09.685 --> 01:36:12.979
The rats, the hoods,
and the killers were in their holes.


1272
01:36:13.689 --> 01:36:15.273
I hate killers.

1273
01:36:16.108 --> 01:36:19.652
My name is Rod Riley.
I'm a detective.


1274
01:36:21.822 --> 01:36:24.616
Somewhere in a furnished room...

1275
01:36:24.825 --> 01:36:27.702
...some guy was practicing on a horn.

1276
01:36:28.162 --> 01:36:30.204
It was a lonesome sound.

1277
01:36:31.999 --> 01:36:34.083
It crawled on my spine.

1278
01:36:35.794 --> 01:36:40.089
I had just finished a tough case.
I was ready to hit the sack.


1279
01:36:46.889 --> 01:36:50.892
I can smell trouble a mile off,
and this poor kid was in trouble.


1280
01:36:51.477 --> 01:36:52.852
Big trouble.

1281
01:36:53.103 --> 01:36:57.190
She's scared,
scared as a turkey in November.


1282
01:37:18.212 --> 01:37:23.132
There was nothing left of the guy,
nothing at all, except...


1283
01:37:24.510 --> 01:37:29.180
...a rag, a bone,
and a hank of hair.

1284
01:37:30.099 --> 01:37:33.559
The guy had been trying
to tell me something, but what?


1285
01:37:52.788 --> 01:37:55.456
So that's the way
they wanted to play. All right.


1286
01:37:55.666 --> 01:37:58.751
Somewhere in the city there was
a killer and that was bad.


1287
01:37:58.961 --> 01:38:01.295
Bad for the killer,
because I shoot hard.


1288
01:38:02.172 --> 01:38:04.090
And I hate hard.

1289
01:38:14.685 --> 01:38:17.270
I was playing a hunch.

1290
01:39:00.606 --> 01:39:02.815
She came at me in sections.

1291
01:39:03.484 --> 01:39:05.818
More curves than a scenic railway.

1292
01:39:08.155 --> 01:39:11.115
She was bad, she was dangerous.

1293
01:39:11.325 --> 01:39:14.243
I wouldn't trust her any farther
than I could throw her.


1294
01:39:14.453 --> 01:39:17.747
She was selling hard,
but I wasn't buying.


1295
01:40:06.505 --> 01:40:09.882
This had to be Mr. Big.
Get him and you get them all.


1296
01:40:38.412 --> 01:40:43.499
There was something about this kid
that made you want to protect her for life.


1297
01:42:00.953 --> 01:42:02.870
That bullet was meant for me.

1298
01:42:06.625 --> 01:42:10.753
Maybe this was a long shot,
but I've seen some funny ones pay off.


1299
01:42:32.276 --> 01:42:35.236
I was beginning to see daylight.

1300
01:42:50.002 --> 01:42:53.838
These mugs were smart,
but they made one mistake.


1301
01:42:55.924 --> 01:42:57.425
They got me mad.

1302
01:45:32.080 --> 01:45:35.875
All the pieces fitted together.
I knew how the crime had been done.


1303
01:45:36.084 --> 01:45:39.086
The high note on the trumpet
had shattered the glass.


1304
01:45:57.272 --> 01:45:59.607
The glass with the nitroglycerin.

1305
01:46:01.651 --> 01:46:04.778
Now I knew who the killer was,
but it didn't matter anymore.


1306
01:46:04.988 --> 01:46:06.822
Killers have to die.

1307
01:46:44.152 --> 01:46:47.488
Another page in the casebook
of Rod Riley was finished.


1308
01:46:47.822 --> 01:46:51.325
The city was asleep.
The joints were closed.


1309
01:46:51.535 --> 01:46:54.912
The rats, the hoods,
and the killers were in their holes.


1310
01:46:56.248 --> 01:46:59.208
I felt good,
but something was missing.


1311
01:47:01.461 --> 01:47:04.880
She was bad, she was dangerous.

1312
01:47:05.090 --> 01:47:08.175
I wouldn't trust her any farther
than I could throw her.


1313
01:47:08.843 --> 01:47:11.720
But she was my kind of woman.

1314
01:47:44.421 --> 01:47:46.964
- Who's that? Somebody come in?
- No one, Mr. Hunter.


1315
01:47:47.173 --> 01:47:50.718
- You sure? Did you look out in the hall?
- Not a soul, Mr. Hunter.


1316
01:47:51.386 --> 01:47:55.472
I can't understand it.
Are you sure this show's a hit?


1317
01:47:55.974 --> 01:47:58.642
A very big hit, Mr. Hunter.
Congratulations.


1318
01:47:58.852 --> 01:48:00.561
It certainly doesn't feel like one.

1319
01:48:00.770 --> 01:48:04.106
I didn't expect them to pull my carriage
through the streets or hurl flowers at me...


1320
01:48:07.027 --> 01:48:09.320
- Hal, come on, boy. Have a drink.
- No, thanks.


1321
01:48:09.529 --> 01:48:12.573
- Got any notes for the cast for tomorrow?
- No.


1322
01:48:12.782 --> 01:48:14.158
- Good night.
- Say, look.


1323
01:48:14.367 --> 01:48:17.328
Doesn't anybody come backstage anymore
on opening nights?


1324
01:48:17.537 --> 01:48:21.248
No. It's considered old-fashioned.
Have a good night's rest, Tony.


1325
01:48:24.085 --> 01:48:25.794
Did Gaby go out with Paul?

1326
01:48:26.004 --> 01:48:29.131
Gaby? I don't know. I guess so.
Good night, Tony.


1327
01:48:32.469 --> 01:48:34.637
Bobby, you know what I'm going to do?

1328
01:48:34.846 --> 01:48:37.139
I'm going out to the biggest nightclub
I can find.


1329
01:48:37.349 --> 01:48:39.600
I'm going to get a glass of champagne
and celebrate.


1330
01:48:39.809 --> 01:48:41.226
Fine idea, sir.

1331
01:48:51.571 --> 01:48:54.823
I'll go my way by myself

1332
01:48:55.909 --> 01:48:59.036
All alone in a crowd

1333
01:49:00.330 --> 01:49:03.332
I'll try to apply myself

1334
01:49:04.542 --> 01:49:07.252
And teach my heart how to sing

1335
01:49:08.922 --> 01:49:12.341
I'll go my way by myself

1336
01:49:12.967 --> 01:49:15.969
Like a bird on the wing

1337
01:49:17.472 --> 01:49:20.474
I'll face the unknown

1338
01:49:21.518 --> 01:49:24.770
I'll build a world of my own

1339
01:49:29.109 --> 01:49:33.696
He's a jolly good fellow
He's a jolly good fellow


1340
01:49:33.947 --> 01:49:37.199
He's a jolly good fellow

1341
01:49:37.450 --> 01:49:41.704
That nobody can deny
That nobody can deny


1342
01:49:42.163 --> 01:49:44.331
That nobody can deny

1343
01:49:44.541 --> 01:49:47.876
For he's a jolly good fellow

1344
01:49:48.086 --> 01:49:51.088
That nobody can deny

1345
01:49:54.134 --> 01:49:56.218
Tony, the whole company got together.

1346
01:49:56.428 --> 01:49:59.638
We all chipped in,
and we bought you... nothing.


1347
01:50:00.432 --> 01:50:02.182
So we have nothing to give you...

1348
01:50:02.392 --> 01:50:05.602
...but our gratitude, our admiration...

1349
01:50:06.396 --> 01:50:08.188
...and our love.

1350
01:50:08.523 --> 01:50:10.399
The show's a hit, but we all feel...

1351
01:50:10.608 --> 01:50:14.611
...no matter what might've happened to it,
it was wonderful knowing you...


1352
01:50:15.822 --> 01:50:17.448
...working with you.

1353
01:50:17.741 --> 01:50:20.993
Maybe some of us didn't see eye to eye
with you at the beginning.


1354
01:50:21.202 --> 01:50:23.912
Maybe we thought
we wouldn't work out together...


1355
01:50:24.581 --> 01:50:25.956
...but we have.

1356
01:50:26.916 --> 01:50:29.501
Yes, there were obstacles between us...

1357
01:50:31.337 --> 01:50:33.630
...but we've kissed them good-bye.

1358
01:50:34.841 --> 01:50:39.136
We've come to love you, Tony.
We belong together.


1359
01:50:41.014 --> 01:50:43.223
The show's going to run a long time.

1360
01:50:44.309 --> 01:50:48.437
As far as I'm concerned,
it's going to run forever.


1361
01:50:58.323 --> 01:51:01.158
- Tony.
- May we say something?


1362
01:51:01.659 --> 01:51:04.745
A show that is really a show

1363
01:51:04.954 --> 01:51:08.415
Sends you out with
a kind of a glow

1364
01:51:08.625 --> 01:51:12.377
And you say as
you go on your way

1365
01:51:13.505 --> 01:51:16.089
"That's entertainment!"

1366
01:51:16.925 --> 01:51:19.676
A song that is winging along

1367
01:51:19.886 --> 01:51:23.430
Or a dance with a touch of romance

1368
01:51:23.640 --> 01:51:27.226
Is the art that appeals to the heart

1369
01:51:28.436 --> 01:51:31.271
That's entertainment!

1370
01:51:31.481 --> 01:51:35.067
Admit we're a hit
And we'll go on from there


1371
01:51:35.276 --> 01:51:38.320
We played a charade
That was lighter than air


1372
01:51:39.489 --> 01:51:42.199
A good old-fashioned affair

1373
01:51:42.408 --> 01:51:45.953
As we sing this finale
We hope it was up your alley


1374
01:51:46.162 --> 01:51:49.373
No death like you get in Macbeth

1375
01:51:49.582 --> 01:51:52.960
No ordeal like the end of Camille

1376
01:51:53.169 --> 01:51:56.964
This good-bye brings a tear to the eye

1377
01:51:57.173 --> 01:52:00.801
The world is a stage
The stage is a world


1378
01:52:01.010 --> 01:52:07.724
Of entertainment
