1
00:00:25.397 --> 00:00:27.356
Sam? I thought that was you!

2
00:00:27.486 --> 00:00:29.227
Dr. Goodman!
How lovely to see you!


3
00:00:30.707 --> 00:00:32.535
Everything alright my lovelies?

4
00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:36.234
What can I get you?

5
00:00:36.365 --> 00:00:37.777
- I'll have a cup of tea please.
- Hmm.


6
00:00:37.801 --> 00:00:38.801
Make that two.

7
00:00:40.978 --> 00:00:42.826
Rachel and Sam have been seeing
each other for years.


8
00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:45.722
I... I assumed you knew.

9
00:00:45.853 --> 00:00:47.439
- I'll see you tonight?
- I'll try and swing by


10
00:00:47.463 --> 00:00:48.986
if I don't get
any better offers!


11
00:00:49.117 --> 00:00:51.641
Stay away from my daughter.
Do you understand?


12
00:00:51.772 --> 00:00:52.642
Rachel!

13
00:00:52.773 --> 00:00:53.338
Sorry.

14
00:00:53.469 --> 00:00:55.863
No, I am.

15
00:00:55.993 --> 00:00:57.690
I am sorry
that you left me here.


16
00:00:57.821 --> 00:01:00.650
Please, Sam. Please join us?

17
00:01:01.782 --> 00:01:03.827
You need to get your head
out of the clouds, boy.


18
00:01:03.958 --> 00:01:05.611
Get involved in real life.

19
00:01:05.742 --> 00:01:07.004
I have a real life!

20
00:01:09.702 --> 00:01:11.008
But where were you running to?

21
00:01:12.749 --> 00:01:14.901
You have to put this behind you
if you're going to get better.


22
00:01:14.925 --> 00:01:16.318
Solomon had sinned.

23
00:01:16.448 --> 00:01:18.929
Solomon had turned his back
on God.


24
00:01:20.278 --> 00:01:22.237
Don't tell me
you knew about this, dad?


25
00:01:24.021 --> 00:01:27.720
I'm not an idiot, Sam!
I can smell the sex on you!


26
00:01:28.896 --> 00:01:30.593
You do realise
what needs to be done,


27
00:01:30.723 --> 00:01:31.723
don't you, Alan?

28
00:01:35.641 --> 00:01:37.382
Are you alright, Sam?

29
00:01:37.513 --> 00:01:40.124
Yeah, sort of it.

30
00:01:40.255 --> 00:01:41.517
It's been a weird day.

31
00:06:05.911 --> 00:06:08.000
Captain, tell them to prepare
for the attack.


32
00:06:08.131 --> 00:06:09.176
Sir.

33
00:06:20.839 --> 00:06:23.059
Um sir, he says
that we should actually


34
00:06:23.190 --> 00:06:25.714
leave this place immediately.

35
00:06:38.596 --> 00:06:39.902
He says it's dangerous, sir.

36
00:06:40.032 --> 00:06:43.035
That this mask
is somehow cursed.


37
00:06:43.166 --> 00:06:44.726
That it can't be removed
from this place


38
00:06:44.820 --> 00:06:47.562
without unleashing
some sort of evil spirit.


39
00:06:49.303 --> 00:06:51.000
If we're all found here sir,
then...


40
00:06:53.002 --> 00:06:56.614
- Well? Spit it out, man!
- We're dead. Sir.


41
00:06:58.573 --> 00:07:01.793
You tell him from me
that we will do no such thing!


42
00:07:01.924 --> 00:07:03.578
You tell him I've been searching

43
00:07:03.708 --> 00:07:05.884
for this place for the best part
of two years,


44
00:07:06.015 --> 00:07:10.150
and I will absolutely not leave
without what I came for!


45
00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:12.413
- Curse or not!
- Sir.


46
00:07:31.649 --> 00:07:34.304
Now, get your men together,
captain!


47
00:07:34.435 --> 00:07:36.480
That mask belongs to me now.

48
00:08:56.821 --> 00:08:58.040
Charge!

49
00:12:36.519 --> 00:12:39.174
♪ There you are
Across the room ♪


50
00:12:40.392 --> 00:12:42.482
♪ Looking beautiful...

51
00:12:44.658 --> 00:12:46.573
- Whoa!
- What?


52
00:12:46.703 --> 00:12:47.703
Come on, Mary!

53
00:12:47.748 --> 00:12:48.986
Your parents
are in the other room.


54
00:12:49.010 --> 00:12:50.770
We're not even supposed
to have the door closed!


55
00:12:50.794 --> 00:12:53.101
Come on, Johnny.
You know you want to.


56
00:13:00.021 --> 00:13:03.590
- Even if I do, God doesn't.
- God?


57
00:13:05.679 --> 00:13:08.159
You're unbelievable!

58
00:13:08.638 --> 00:13:10.422
You're meant to be my first.

59
00:13:14.905 --> 00:13:16.143
You know
if you're not careful, Johnny,


60
00:13:16.167 --> 00:13:17.995
you're gonna lose me.

61
00:13:19.214 --> 00:13:21.782
I... I just think
that we should wait


62
00:13:21.912 --> 00:13:23.348
until we're married.

63
00:13:23.479 --> 00:13:27.004
Pre-marital relations
are the devil's work.


64
00:13:27.135 --> 00:13:28.615
I just wanna be like
your parents.


65
00:13:28.745 --> 00:13:32.270
Married? Johnny, I'm 18.
I won't be marrying.


66
00:13:34.664 --> 00:13:37.885
Look, the last thing
I want to be like is my parents.


67
00:13:40.452 --> 00:13:41.976
Go home, Johnny.

68
00:14:31.852 --> 00:14:35.420
- Yes?
- Oh, hi, yeah, um...


69
00:14:35.551 --> 00:14:37.271
I'm looking for anything
that you might have


70
00:14:37.379 --> 00:14:38.989
that looks African...

71
00:14:40.208 --> 00:14:43.428
or vintage,
or African vintage?


72
00:14:45.213 --> 00:14:46.997
Or, or just interesting?

73
00:14:47.128 --> 00:14:50.479
So, because I'm Black,
I should have something African?


74
00:14:50.610 --> 00:14:54.265
No, no, no, no, no, no.
I, uh, er...


75
00:14:54.396 --> 00:14:56.050
I'll just have a look around.

76
00:14:58.574 --> 00:15:01.185
Todd! Get in here!

77
00:15:18.289 --> 00:15:20.117
Yeah, look, I gotta go.

78
00:15:21.902 --> 00:15:23.207
Can I help you?

79
00:15:23.338 --> 00:15:26.950
Uh, yes, I was just telling
your, er...


80
00:15:28.604 --> 00:15:31.563
- Oh, my boss?
- Yes! Your boss.


81
00:15:31.694 --> 00:15:33.324
Um, I'm looking for anything
you might have


82
00:15:33.348 --> 00:15:34.871
that looks African?

83
00:15:36.090 --> 00:15:40.398
What kinda thing?
I mean, what for?


84
00:15:40.529 --> 00:15:44.925
Well, um,
just between you and me,


85
00:15:45.055 --> 00:15:48.972
I work in the film business,
the adult film business.


86
00:15:50.452 --> 00:15:53.760
And, uh, we're doing
a parody version of Tarzan,


87
00:15:53.890 --> 00:15:57.067
and I need props and stuff
to make it look authentic.


88
00:16:00.810 --> 00:16:04.161
So, Todd?

89
00:16:06.424 --> 00:16:08.296
Have you got anything?

90
00:16:08.426 --> 00:16:12.213
Necklace? Tribal shield?

91
00:16:12.343 --> 00:16:15.129
- Bit of illegal ivory?
- No.


92
00:16:15.259 --> 00:16:17.392
We don't really have anything
like that I'm afraid.


93
00:16:17.522 --> 00:16:21.613
Oh, that's a shame Todd.
I could have done you an offer.


94
00:16:21.744 --> 00:16:25.052
You know, maybe, uh,
a trip to the set?


95
00:16:25.182 --> 00:16:27.837
Meet some of the performers?

96
00:16:27.968 --> 00:16:30.753
In return for anything that
might have worked, you know?


97
00:16:33.408 --> 00:16:34.888
Wait!

98
00:16:36.454 --> 00:16:39.196
I do have something
that might work.


99
00:16:42.460 --> 00:16:44.288
Meet me out in the alley
in ten minutes.


100
00:16:44.419 --> 00:16:48.292
She's got something, a mask,

101
00:16:48.423 --> 00:16:50.512
but she says
it's never for sale,


102
00:16:50.642 --> 00:16:53.645
so we gotta keep it quiet,
you know?


103
00:17:17.234 --> 00:17:19.394
Take dinner out of the oven,
I'll be there in a minute.


104
00:17:35.470 --> 00:17:36.470
How's it looking?

105
00:17:51.442 --> 00:17:53.967
Where are you off to
this evening, sweetie?


106
00:17:54.097 --> 00:17:56.665
There's a party at Chad's house.

107
00:17:56.796 --> 00:18:00.103
Uh, you're not going anywhere
dressed like that, young lady.


108
00:18:00.234 --> 00:18:02.236
- Dad?!
- No arguments!


109
00:18:02.366 --> 00:18:04.629
- But Dad, Todd's going!
- Todd's a boy!


110
00:18:04.760 --> 00:18:06.283
He can look after himself.

111
00:18:06.414 --> 00:18:07.197
You're not leaving this house

112
00:18:07.328 --> 00:18:09.069
looking like
some two-bit jezebel,


113
00:18:09.199 --> 00:18:10.984
do you understand me, young
lady?


114
00:18:11.114 --> 00:18:12.794
- But dad...
- While you live under my roof,


115
00:18:12.899 --> 00:18:15.727
and I pay the rent,
what I say goes!


116
00:18:15.858 --> 00:18:17.729
Now, go and get some
proper clothes on!


117
00:18:17.860 --> 00:18:19.533
What you mean is
you don't want me to have fun?


118
00:18:19.557 --> 00:18:23.039
That's right! No fun!
Not in my house!


119
00:18:30.438 --> 00:18:32.179
What?

120
00:18:33.310 --> 00:18:35.486
That's right! My house.

121
00:18:40.013 --> 00:18:41.425
And don't slam the doors
in my house!


122
00:18:41.449 --> 00:18:43.886
I'll get my own damned place!

123
00:18:48.630 --> 00:18:50.719
You know I don't like carrots!

124
00:18:56.768 --> 00:18:58.509
Yo! What's up, dickcheeese?

125
00:18:58.640 --> 00:19:01.077
Go fuck yourself.
Already did.


126
00:19:01.208 --> 00:19:03.427
Gotta clean the pipes
before a big night out.


127
00:19:04.951 --> 00:19:07.736
Look...

128
00:19:07.867 --> 00:19:10.870
You know what your problem is?
Respect.


129
00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:13.002
You ain't got none
'cause you don't give none.


130
00:19:14.177 --> 00:19:16.614
He was the same with me
'til I got a job.


131
00:19:18.399 --> 00:19:21.184
I'll, er... tell everyone
you said hi.


132
00:20:10.190 --> 00:20:14.846
- Jerry, no.
- No, Jerry!


133
00:20:16.109 --> 00:20:20.417
I know you're trying,
but listen, but...


134
00:20:20.548 --> 00:20:24.856
Listen, I don't wanna do
another one of these movies.


135
00:20:24.987 --> 00:20:26.728
Because they're tired.

136
00:20:29.687 --> 00:20:34.779
Yeah, but the last one
barely sold 5,000 copies.


137
00:20:34.910 --> 00:20:37.826
And Bunny's way past her best,
I mean way past.


138
00:20:39.436 --> 00:20:40.872
And to be honest,
I'm sick to death


139
00:20:41.003 --> 00:20:44.137
of seeing Frank's ginger cock
and balls


140
00:20:44.267 --> 00:20:46.313
in my edit suite every day.

141
00:20:47.401 --> 00:20:50.012
But can't you get me
another gig?


142
00:20:57.541 --> 00:20:59.065
A TV spot
for incontinence pads?!


143
00:20:59.195 --> 00:21:00.980
Are you taking the piss?

144
00:21:02.155 --> 00:21:04.461
No! That's not what I wanted!

145
00:21:07.073 --> 00:21:11.294
Look, Jerry, I gotta go.

146
00:21:11.425 --> 00:21:15.603
Yeah, I, uh, got...
I got an interview today


147
00:21:15.733 --> 00:21:16.778
with a new girl.

148
00:21:16.908 --> 00:21:18.388
Yeah, alright.

149
00:21:24.481 --> 00:21:28.529
Hi! Uh, I'm not really sure
I'm in the right place?


150
00:21:28.659 --> 00:21:30.966
Literally,
or metaphorically, honey?


151
00:21:41.629 --> 00:21:44.458
Take a seat, you're here
for the interview, right?


152
00:21:44.588 --> 00:21:45.807
Good.

153
00:21:46.590 --> 00:21:48.418
My name's Ken,

154
00:21:48.549 --> 00:21:50.638
but everyone around here
calls me Roosh.


155
00:21:51.508 --> 00:21:53.641
- And you are...?
- Mary.


156
00:21:53.771 --> 00:21:55.904
Mary. Good, at least
you got that right.


157
00:21:56.035 --> 00:21:57.969
And you know this is just
a fluffer's position for now?


158
00:21:57.993 --> 00:21:59.777
Er, yeah.

159
00:22:00.952 --> 00:22:04.304
But I don't really know
what you'll be needing.


160
00:22:05.087 --> 00:22:07.002
I've never really
done this before.


161
00:22:10.049 --> 00:22:12.181
Good.

162
00:22:12.312 --> 00:22:15.793
Well, you'll be helping out
in all departments.


163
00:22:15.924 --> 00:22:19.710
Lending a hand or a mouth,
wherever necessary.


164
00:22:26.891 --> 00:22:30.069
- And you are 18?
- Yeah. Uh, yeah.


165
00:22:39.165 --> 00:22:43.299
Good. Right, I can offer

166
00:22:43.430 --> 00:22:45.084
but you have to start tomorrow.

167
00:22:47.303 --> 00:22:50.567
- Any questions?
- Yeah, uh, Ken...


168
00:22:50.698 --> 00:22:52.656
- Roosh.
- Roosh, that is a phallic.


169
00:22:52.787 --> 00:22:58.532
Look, adult films.
For adults.


170
00:23:01.361 --> 00:23:03.521
Look, you'll never be seen,
it's purely a fluffing gig.


171
00:23:05.495 --> 00:23:06.975
And the money's really good.

172
00:23:07.106 --> 00:23:08.890
Especially for someone your age.

173
00:23:13.895 --> 00:23:16.506
- I'm not sure...
- Look, they're just films.


174
00:23:18.465 --> 00:23:21.076
They're there to serve
a particular audience.


175
00:23:23.557 --> 00:23:25.646
They are proper films.

176
00:23:29.084 --> 00:23:31.086
And no one will ever find out.

177
00:23:32.783 --> 00:23:35.177
At least that's what
I keep telling myself.


178
00:23:37.701 --> 00:23:41.618
Okay?
See you at 07:00 am tomorrow.


179
00:23:44.230 --> 00:23:45.816
- Don't be late.
- Thank you. Thank you, Ken.


180
00:23:45.840 --> 00:23:47.146
- Roosh.
- Roosh.


181
00:23:47.276 --> 00:23:49.322
- Don't let me down.
- Thank you.


182
00:23:49.452 --> 00:23:52.890
Oh, and, uh, wear something
comfortable, no push up bras.


183
00:23:53.021 --> 00:23:54.738
Some of the lads can get
a little bit over excited


184
00:23:54.762 --> 00:23:57.678
if you look good, okay?

185
00:24:08.863 --> 00:24:10.256
Fucking newbies.

186
00:24:18.742 --> 00:24:21.528
Hello, sweetie. 
How was school?

187
00:24:21.658 --> 00:24:27.098
Uh, great, Mum. Guess what?

188
00:24:28.709 --> 00:24:31.494
I got a job.

189
00:24:31.625 --> 00:24:34.193
At a film production company.

190
00:24:34.323 --> 00:24:36.325
I'm the assistant.

191
00:24:36.456 --> 00:24:40.460
Is that a good idea, honey,
with your exams coming up?


192
00:24:40.590 --> 00:24:42.636
And what's your father
going to say?


193
00:24:42.766 --> 00:24:43.985
I'll be fine.

194
00:24:45.639 --> 00:24:47.554
I just wanna get him
off my back.


195
00:24:48.859 --> 00:24:50.948
He said that when I can start
paying my own way,


196
00:24:51.079 --> 00:24:52.602
he'd let me do what I want.

197
00:24:55.910 --> 00:24:58.086
How exciting.

198
00:24:59.218 --> 00:25:01.176
I sometimes wish
that I'd had a job,


199
00:25:01.307 --> 00:25:04.135
but your father
would never allow it.


200
00:25:04.266 --> 00:25:07.400
Too much to do around the home
all the time.


201
00:25:07.530 --> 00:25:09.750
I want the independence.

202
00:25:09.880 --> 00:25:12.231
I wanna get out,
I wanna see the world.


203
00:25:13.623 --> 00:25:16.496
I can't let him control me
forever.


204
00:25:18.541 --> 00:25:20.804
I understand, darling.

205
00:25:23.024 --> 00:25:26.201
So, what will you have to do?
What film are they making?


206
00:25:28.856 --> 00:25:31.032
It's a bit vague.

207
00:25:31.162 --> 00:25:34.340
Ah, just helping out
whenever anybody needs me to,


208
00:25:34.470 --> 00:25:35.863
that sort of thing.

209
00:25:37.734 --> 00:25:39.823
Just gotta suck it and see.

210
00:25:41.085 --> 00:25:42.522
But there might be some content

211
00:25:42.652 --> 00:25:46.743
that you might not approve of
or dad.


212
00:25:46.874 --> 00:25:49.442
Oh, baby!

213
00:25:49.572 --> 00:25:51.444
Your father and I have seen
all sorts of films


214
00:25:51.574 --> 00:25:53.533
over the years.

215
00:25:53.663 --> 00:25:54.901
Some of them
that we could never tell


216
00:25:54.925 --> 00:25:56.710
our church friends about!

217
00:25:58.015 --> 00:26:00.322
Your father thought
that "Brokeback Mountain"


218
00:26:00.453 --> 00:26:04.718
was a masterpiece but, you know,
he could never say anything.


219
00:26:06.197 --> 00:26:10.550
He thinks that makes him sound
like a, you know, a "gay."


220
00:26:12.726 --> 00:26:16.817
Well, I'm sure
if it's God's will,


221
00:26:16.947 --> 00:26:19.254
you'll take to it like a duck
to water.


222
00:26:22.170 --> 00:26:23.582
And no need to say anything
to your father about it


223
00:26:23.606 --> 00:26:25.347
just yet.

224
00:26:25.478 --> 00:26:29.699
Maybe don't mention it
to him ever?


225
00:26:35.618 --> 00:26:38.578
And here love,
get your hair done


226
00:26:38.708 --> 00:26:40.188
for your first day.

227
00:27:42.381 --> 00:27:44.252
- Oh. Oh.
- Oh, shit!


228
00:27:44.383 --> 00:27:45.688
I'm sorry!

229
00:27:53.783 --> 00:27:56.656
You must be Chardonnay's
replacement?


230
00:27:57.657 --> 00:27:59.223
Mary, right?

231
00:28:06.492 --> 00:28:07.884
Good.

232
00:28:08.015 --> 00:28:10.191
So, let's grab all this shit
you just made me drop


233
00:28:10.321 --> 00:28:12.106
and put it on that table
over there.


234
00:28:29.863 --> 00:28:31.560
You okay?

235
00:28:37.479 --> 00:28:40.917
Come on, let me introduce you
to the gang.


236
00:28:41.048 --> 00:28:43.485
You ever done this before?

237
00:28:43.616 --> 00:28:48.011
- Uh, no. No.
- Don't worry.


238
00:28:48.142 --> 00:28:49.336
Everyone's gotta start
somewhere.


239
00:28:49.360 --> 00:28:51.537
Thing's you gotta remember,

240
00:28:51.667 --> 00:28:55.018
that whatever you see here
today, we're making art.


241
00:28:55.149 --> 00:28:58.369
Like art for commerce,
for a very specific audience,


242
00:28:58.500 --> 00:29:00.633
namely white, middle-income boys

243
00:29:00.763 --> 00:29:03.592
aged 14 to 25
with little imagination,


244
00:29:03.723 --> 00:29:04.898
and less intelligence.

245
00:29:05.028 --> 00:29:06.682
I mean, if they had
any of those things,


246
00:29:06.813 --> 00:29:09.076
they wouldn't be watching
this shit, would they?


247
00:29:09.206 --> 00:29:10.860
And quick and easy
gratification,


248
00:29:10.991 --> 00:29:12.427
that's why we're all here.

249
00:29:12.558 --> 00:29:13.863
Simple plot.

250
00:29:13.994 --> 00:29:16.475
Performers
that people recognise.


251
00:29:16.605 --> 00:29:19.478
No challenge intellectually,

252
00:29:19.608 --> 00:29:23.482
and all culminating in gallons
of bodily fluids.


253
00:29:23.612 --> 00:29:29.444
No subtext,
no incredible dialogue.


254
00:29:29.575 --> 00:29:32.229
You got it?

255
00:29:32.360 --> 00:29:37.496
Right, so this is Milo,
he deals with lights and camera.


256
00:29:39.541 --> 00:29:45.068
And Mike. Sound man
and total fucking pervert.


257
00:29:45.199 --> 00:29:48.115
Stay away from him
unless absolutely necessary.


258
00:29:50.073 --> 00:29:53.642
- Sorry, what's that?
- Uh, this is Mary, the new girl.


259
00:29:53.773 --> 00:29:56.471
Oh, hello Mary,
good to meet you.


260
00:29:56.602 --> 00:29:58.821
If you want to join us
for a beer after work,


261
00:29:58.952 --> 00:30:00.649
we'd really enjoy that?

262
00:30:03.434 --> 00:30:05.219
Fucking lesbian!

263
00:30:13.009 --> 00:30:15.446
Billie and Debbie,
makeup and talent.


264
00:30:15.577 --> 00:30:16.926
Hey honey, welcome!

265
00:30:23.150 --> 00:30:24.997
You're gonna have to get used
to seeing a lot more of her


266
00:30:25.021 --> 00:30:26.501
than that, sweetie!

267
00:30:28.634 --> 00:30:30.766
Julius and Otto, male talent.

268
00:30:37.207 --> 00:30:38.576
Yeah, never a good idea
to get involved


269
00:30:38.600 --> 00:30:40.167
with the male talent,
so probably best


270
00:30:40.297 --> 00:30:43.344
you don't make eye contact
when you're, uh... working.


271
00:30:45.564 --> 00:30:47.304
I'm not sure about this, Kimmy.

272
00:30:47.435 --> 00:30:49.263
Mary, Mary.

273
00:30:49.393 --> 00:30:51.308
Listen, just block it out.

274
00:30:51.439 --> 00:30:52.839
How much are you getting
paid today?


275
00:30:52.875 --> 00:30:56.357
- Three hundred.
- Three hundred? That's amazing!


276
00:30:56.487 --> 00:30:58.838
What you gonna spend that on?

277
00:30:58.968 --> 00:31:02.102
I, uh... I want to move out
of my parents' house.


278
00:31:02.232 --> 00:31:04.887
Move out? That's amazing!

279
00:31:05.018 --> 00:31:07.150
I'm so proud of you,
standing on your own two feet.


280
00:31:07.281 --> 00:31:09.370
Sticking it to your dad, I bet?

281
00:31:09.500 --> 00:31:10.893
Good for you!

282
00:31:11.894 --> 00:31:13.766
Oh, uh, you've met Ken,
haven't you?


283
00:31:13.896 --> 00:31:17.552
Yes, so, Ken told me
to tell you that Chardonnay,


284
00:31:17.683 --> 00:31:19.423
who used to do your job.

285
00:31:19.554 --> 00:31:22.992
Well, she kinda did get involved
with the male talent,


286
00:31:23.123 --> 00:31:28.737
so yeah... just don't make
eye contact, okay? Okay?


287
00:31:28.868 --> 00:31:30.609
Right, any questions?

288
00:31:32.480 --> 00:31:35.135
- Kimmy?
- Hey, sweetie!


289
00:31:35.265 --> 00:31:37.528
Ready for your time to shine?

290
00:31:38.878 --> 00:31:43.491
Uh, I... me... I didn't realise
that I was...


291
00:31:43.622 --> 00:31:47.060
Sure, but you know
what you're doing, right?


292
00:31:48.017 --> 00:31:51.717
I mean, you've, you know?

293
00:31:53.414 --> 00:31:56.199
Oh! Yeah! Yeah. Loads, loads.

294
00:31:56.330 --> 00:31:58.221
You know, you only have to do it
for a minute or two


295
00:31:58.245 --> 00:32:00.073
- before each take? Okay?
- Mm-hmm.


296
00:32:00.203 --> 00:32:03.554
And the money's good, right?
Really good!


297
00:32:05.687 --> 00:32:07.863
You might wanna do
a quick trial run.


298
00:32:07.994 --> 00:32:11.040
Some of these guys,
they can get pretty eager.


299
00:32:37.458 --> 00:32:38.783
So, I managed to get some
pretty cool props.


300
00:32:38.807 --> 00:32:39.807
Okay.

301
00:32:43.725 --> 00:32:45.858
Perfect.

302
00:32:45.988 --> 00:32:48.010
And I thought maybe we could put
one of the guys in this


303
00:32:48.034 --> 00:32:50.123
for the first part
of the opening scene?


304
00:33:08.228 --> 00:33:09.882
Kimmy, how much did you spend
on all this?


305
00:33:10.012 --> 00:33:12.058
- Oh, 200 for the lot.
- Two hundred?


306
00:33:12.188 --> 00:33:14.625
Jesus Christ what are we gonna
do with all this shit?!


307
00:33:15.278 --> 00:33:16.865
Well, you're the one
who wanted production value?


308
00:33:16.889 --> 00:33:19.152
No one give a shit
about production value!


309
00:33:19.282 --> 00:33:24.070
All they wanna see is dick,
pussies, tits and arseholes.


310
00:33:25.201 --> 00:33:27.482
- What about the mise-en-scene?
- Fuck your mise-en-scene!


311
00:33:27.595 --> 00:33:30.511
We're not making
Jurassic fucking Park here!


312
00:33:30.641 --> 00:33:33.470
Get this shit out of my office,
especially that!


313
00:33:34.689 --> 00:33:36.778
Come on, move it!

314
00:33:38.693 --> 00:33:41.435
And make sure Debbie's lubed up
and ready in ten.


315
00:33:42.697 --> 00:33:44.830
I'm not paying
another fucking doctor's bill


316
00:33:44.960 --> 00:33:46.614
for friction burn!

317
00:34:00.367 --> 00:34:01.760
Fuck.

318
00:34:02.717 --> 00:34:04.893
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.


319
00:34:20.735 --> 00:34:22.998
When are we gonna get this
fuck party started?!


320
00:34:23.129 --> 00:34:26.436
- Oh, fuck off, Mike!
- Fucking lesbian!


321
00:34:31.485 --> 00:34:33.226
Look, I'm sorry.

322
00:34:33.356 --> 00:34:35.315
Can you just take this box

323
00:34:35.445 --> 00:34:37.012
and put it in the green room
please?


324
00:34:50.330 --> 00:34:51.940
Come!

325
00:35:05.736 --> 00:35:09.262
Uh, Kimmy asked me
to put these in here?


326
00:35:09.392 --> 00:35:11.438
Oh? Uh, anywhere will do.

327
00:36:21.812 --> 00:36:24.032
Get yourself together.

328
00:36:24.163 --> 00:36:26.556
Get yourself together.

329
00:36:39.830 --> 00:36:42.355
No. No. No.

330
00:36:53.932 --> 00:36:56.847
Hey beautiful,
how's your first day?


331
00:36:56.978 --> 00:37:01.113
Hey! Um, I don't think
this is the right job for me.


332
00:37:01.243 --> 00:37:02.897
Why? What's up?

333
00:37:03.811 --> 00:37:08.511
Nothing... yet.

334
00:37:09.556 --> 00:37:10.731
That's the issue.

335
00:37:13.038 --> 00:37:15.301
Look, sometimes
we just gotta do these things.


336
00:37:15.431 --> 00:37:17.781
You know, like...
it's God's will.


337
00:37:17.912 --> 00:37:19.958
Are you playing a fucking game?

338
00:37:20.088 --> 00:37:24.179
- Uh, who, me?
- No, no baby, I just... take that!


339
00:37:24.310 --> 00:37:26.703
You're playing
a fucking computer game,


340
00:37:26.834 --> 00:37:29.184
and you're not even listening
to what I'm saying!


341
00:37:29.315 --> 00:37:33.014
- Look, no, no, babe, I mean...
- I, I paused it now.


342
00:37:33.145 --> 00:37:34.276
What's wrong?

343
00:37:34.407 --> 00:37:35.625
Arsehole!

344
00:38:31.812 --> 00:38:33.640
Oh, hey, tea's up!

345
00:38:47.610 --> 00:38:49.308
Mary, isn't it?

346
00:38:50.787 --> 00:38:54.313
- Do you have a boyfriend?
- Yeah. Yes, Johnny.


347
00:38:55.183 --> 00:38:56.402
Only if she insists!

348
00:38:56.532 --> 00:38:57.652
Isn't that right everybody?!

349
00:39:02.886 --> 00:39:04.975
Do you also have a little lamb?

350
00:39:07.195 --> 00:39:09.197
You know, fleece
as white as snow?


351
00:39:14.333 --> 00:39:19.425
Because I'm a big, bad wolf.

352
00:39:20.339 --> 00:39:22.167
My fucking balls!

353
00:39:27.694 --> 00:39:29.696
Oh, that's what they're for!

354
00:39:34.527 --> 00:39:37.095
- Thank you.
- No need.


355
00:39:37.225 --> 00:39:38.637
It's degrading enough
working here already,


356
00:39:38.661 --> 00:39:40.663
without fraternising
with the fanboys too.


357
00:39:42.143 --> 00:39:44.493
Ginger nut?

358
00:39:45.233 --> 00:39:49.107
- Sorry?
- Would you like a ginger nut?


359
00:39:50.108 --> 00:39:52.371
Uh, no thank you.

360
00:39:52.501 --> 00:39:54.895
We're not all wrong 'uns,
you know?


361
00:39:56.375 --> 00:39:59.813
My kids. Max, Liam, and Cody.

362
00:40:00.944 --> 00:40:02.685
We're all just here
to make a bit of money.


363
00:40:09.518 --> 00:40:11.651
- Woowoo! Haaa!
- Wait.


364
00:40:16.003 --> 00:40:17.874
Can you just...?

365
00:40:24.490 --> 00:40:25.795
Whoo ha!

366
00:40:25.926 --> 00:40:28.711
Okay. That's all I can do
for you I'm afraid, Otto.


367
00:40:33.325 --> 00:40:36.154
Do you want a water or anything?

368
00:40:36.284 --> 00:40:39.679
- Otto does not need fluids.
- Okay.


369
00:41:14.801 --> 00:41:17.325
Come on people,
turn 'em off, hand 'em in!


370
00:41:28.815 --> 00:41:30.991
Come on, you too "“fresh meat."”

371
00:41:34.124 --> 00:41:36.388
They fuck up the sound honey.

372
00:46:02.436 --> 00:46:04.264
Okay, right. Listen up.

373
00:46:04.394 --> 00:46:05.657
You hearing me?

374
00:46:05.787 --> 00:46:07.678
Okay, so what I think we'll do
is we'll start off


375
00:46:07.702 --> 00:46:10.183
with missionary first.

376
00:46:10.313 --> 00:46:12.490
And then we'll go to cowgirl,
okay?


377
00:46:12.620 --> 00:46:15.580
And then I want reverse cowgirl.

378
00:46:15.710 --> 00:46:18.626
And then after that
I want some... yeah doggy.


379
00:46:18.757 --> 00:46:19.995
After that we need
to definitely make sure


380
00:46:20.019 --> 00:46:22.021
we get this.

381
00:46:22.151 --> 00:46:23.239
Are you listening?

382
00:46:23.370 --> 00:46:24.980
Definitely make sure
we get this, okay?


383
00:46:26.068 --> 00:46:30.508
And then I want to go to...
a bit of spooning.


384
00:46:30.638 --> 00:46:34.729
After that...
I want piledriver.


385
00:46:35.948 --> 00:46:39.429
Then I want oyster, eagle,
and then you splash the cash.


386
00:46:40.866 --> 00:46:41.866
Got it?

387
00:46:41.910 --> 00:46:44.957
Uh, yeah. Yeah, boss.

388
00:46:47.133 --> 00:46:49.918
- Sure?
- Sure.


389
00:46:58.144 --> 00:46:59.624
You changed your hair?

390
00:47:02.148 --> 00:47:04.106
Julius? You're up.

391
00:47:10.330 --> 00:47:12.332
Well, come on!
He's not gonna blow himself!


392
00:48:29.322 --> 00:48:32.194
Alright! Let's roll!

393
00:49:20.416 --> 00:49:22.636
Ready? Everyone ready?

394
00:49:22.767 --> 00:49:25.073
- Turn over.
- Sound's speed.


395
00:49:25.204 --> 00:49:26.945
And action!

396
00:49:29.469 --> 00:49:31.149
Come on. Come on, let's get you
some water.


397
00:49:31.210 --> 00:49:32.646
Slow it down.

398
00:49:34.779 --> 00:49:36.171
Oh, fuck!

399
00:49:37.129 --> 00:49:38.696
Julius, go deeper.

400
00:49:40.785 --> 00:49:42.569
Go on, hit her.

401
00:49:52.144 --> 00:49:54.102
And cut!

402
00:49:54.233 --> 00:49:57.018
Right, everyone take five.
Stay wet and warm!


403
00:50:01.631 --> 00:50:03.721
- You gonna be okay?
- I think so.


404
00:50:07.376 --> 00:50:10.292
- What the fuck was that?
- I'm sorry.


405
00:50:10.423 --> 00:50:12.077
Do you want that 300 quid
or what?


406
00:50:12.207 --> 00:50:15.297
I do, I do. I just...
I didn't realise...


407
00:50:15.428 --> 00:50:18.997
While I pay the bills
around here, you do as I say.


408
00:50:19.867 --> 00:50:20.999
- Yeah.
- You got it?


409
00:50:21.129 --> 00:50:22.565
Yes sir.

410
00:50:25.655 --> 00:50:29.268
Right. Go outside, have a smoke,
and when you're ready


411
00:50:29.398 --> 00:50:32.750
and you've sorted your shit out,
get your arse back on my set.


412
00:50:37.624 --> 00:50:40.061
I hate to say it,
but he's kinda right, you know?


413
00:50:41.236 --> 00:50:42.368
If you've got bills to pay,

414
00:50:42.498 --> 00:50:43.586
you've just gotta do it,

415
00:50:43.717 --> 00:50:46.372
leave your integrity
at the door, you know?


416
00:50:46.502 --> 00:50:47.828
And I won't be around
the whole time


417
00:50:47.852 --> 00:50:49.505
to look after you.

418
00:50:56.512 --> 00:51:00.908
Hey! Need a hand getting ready
for the scene deep throat?


419
00:51:08.698 --> 00:51:10.526
Yeah. Fucking lesbian!

420
00:52:23.251 --> 00:52:24.905
What is it?

421
00:52:26.254 --> 00:52:27.952
What the fuck?!

422
00:52:28.082 --> 00:52:29.682
I don't know.
Debbie found her like this.


423
00:52:34.523 --> 00:52:38.397
Well, where's Otto, and Kimmy?
Has anyone called an ambulance?


424
00:52:38.527 --> 00:52:40.007
Oh, for fucks sake,
the fucking phones


425
00:52:40.138 --> 00:52:42.836
are on the fucking set! Pillock!

426
00:52:44.142 --> 00:52:45.621
What's going on?
Oh, my God!


427
00:52:45.752 --> 00:52:47.536
Shut up!

428
00:52:53.934 --> 00:52:55.327
I'll get the phones.

429
00:52:55.457 --> 00:52:58.069
You guys stay here,
and lock the door.


430
00:53:02.334 --> 00:53:06.381
- What are you doing?
- I'm locking the fucking door!


431
00:53:06.512 --> 00:53:08.383
Why?

432
00:53:08.514 --> 00:53:10.864
Because she didn't do it
to herself, did she?


433
00:53:10.995 --> 00:53:12.779
You stupid fucking cum dump!

434
00:53:59.260 --> 00:54:00.479
Oh, God!

435
00:54:18.453 --> 00:54:20.368
Otto. That motherfucker.

436
00:54:20.499 --> 00:54:23.110
Now Mike,
we don't know for sure.


437
00:54:23.719 --> 00:54:25.765
Are you kidding me?

438
00:54:26.722 --> 00:54:29.073
- What's taking Milo so long?
- Yeah.


439
00:54:29.203 --> 00:54:32.685
Fucking phones were right
at the top of the fucking bag!


440
00:54:32.815 --> 00:54:35.949
- We should all go.
- No! You are kidding me?


441
00:54:36.080 --> 00:54:37.124
Mike.

442
00:54:37.255 --> 00:54:39.561
Otto is out there
with a fucking knife!


443
00:54:39.692 --> 00:54:41.650
- Mike.
- Too many god damned 'roids!


444
00:54:41.781 --> 00:54:43.739
Mike.

445
00:54:43.870 --> 00:54:48.266
He's gonna fucking, like,
fucking gonna kill us,


446
00:54:48.396 --> 00:54:49.832
that's what he's gonna do.

447
00:54:51.269 --> 00:54:52.574
I can't believe this.

448
00:54:52.705 --> 00:54:56.317
I'm gonna fucking die
on a piece of shit porn shoot.


449
00:54:57.884 --> 00:55:02.715
I've worked on real sets,
you know?


450
00:55:02.845 --> 00:55:06.893
And I do not wanna die
on a fucking liquid,


451
00:55:07.024 --> 00:55:10.288
fucking, lovecheese,
fucking, production!


452
00:55:10.418 --> 00:55:12.159
- Mike!
- What?


453
00:55:12.290 --> 00:55:14.161
You need to be cool.

454
00:55:14.292 --> 00:55:17.599
Nobody else is gonna die.
Whoever did this is long gone.


455
00:55:17.730 --> 00:55:20.254
Just shut the fuck up, Ken!

456
00:55:20.385 --> 00:55:23.214
No one gives a fuck
about what you think!


457
00:55:23.344 --> 00:55:26.043
You miserable piece of shit!

458
00:55:29.002 --> 00:55:31.874
You know, what I fucking hate
about this industry?


459
00:55:32.005 --> 00:55:35.400
- What?
- Motherfuckers like you!


460
00:55:35.530 --> 00:55:37.271
And what's that supposed
to mean?


461
00:55:39.621 --> 00:55:41.710
What the fuck!

462
00:55:42.015 --> 00:55:43.364
Otto?

463
00:55:51.633 --> 00:55:53.200
Where the hell is Milo?!

464
00:55:54.245 --> 00:55:58.162
Look the power just tripped.
There's a breaker in my office.


465
00:55:58.292 --> 00:56:00.425
So?

466
00:56:00.555 --> 00:56:03.689
So, you go with Jules
and check the back door.


467
00:56:03.819 --> 00:56:05.082
I'll go to my office.

468
00:56:05.212 --> 00:56:10.174
Girls, you stay here.
Lock the door, okay?


469
00:56:10.304 --> 00:56:13.046
I ain't fucking going nowhere.

470
00:56:14.047 --> 00:56:17.050
- Yeah, laugh it up, fuzzball.
- Fine.


471
00:56:20.488 --> 00:56:22.055
Jules, you got this.

472
00:57:01.877 --> 00:57:03.183
Hello?

473
00:59:42.255 --> 00:59:44.779
I just wanna make movies.

474
00:59:57.096 --> 00:59:59.968
Please leave a message
after the tone.


475
01:00:00.099 --> 01:00:03.320
Ken, Rooshy baby! Great news.

476
01:00:03.450 --> 01:00:05.017
It's Jerry, by the way,

477
01:00:05.147 --> 01:00:07.019
I sent your script
for "Big Tables"


478
01:00:07.149 --> 01:00:10.457
over to a few people I know
at Tiger Hole Productions in LA,


479
01:00:10.588 --> 01:00:12.241
and guess what?

480
01:00:12.372 --> 01:00:13.721
They love it!

481
01:00:13.852 --> 01:00:15.419
They want an option
for five years,


482
01:00:15.549 --> 01:00:17.334
they're gonna pay you
half a mil now,


483
01:00:17.464 --> 01:00:18.784
and another three
if it gets made!


484
01:00:28.301 --> 01:00:30.172
They should be back by now.

485
01:00:30.303 --> 01:00:31.503
Why aren't the lights back on?

486
01:00:31.609 --> 01:00:33.611
Oh shut up, you fucking whore!

487
01:00:33.741 --> 01:00:35.741
Why don't you shut the fuck up,
you fucking coward?


488
01:00:57.504 --> 01:00:59.680
Fuck!

489
01:00:59.811 --> 01:01:01.378
Fuck.

490
01:01:03.467 --> 01:01:05.251
Come on!

491
01:01:30.319 --> 01:01:31.669
It's been ten minutes.

492
01:01:32.539 --> 01:01:33.888
Oh!

493
01:01:37.022 --> 01:01:39.111
Oh, fuck.

494
01:01:41.722 --> 01:01:44.159
Let's all go together.

495
01:01:45.030 --> 01:01:46.684
Are you fucking crazy?

496
01:01:46.814 --> 01:01:48.860
Otto's out there,
he's gonna kill us all!


497
01:01:50.644 --> 01:01:53.168
Debbie, did you notice
anything unusual


498
01:01:53.299 --> 01:01:54.779
about Otto this morning?

499
01:01:54.909 --> 01:01:56.911
Anything out of the ordinary?

500
01:02:03.222 --> 01:02:05.224
You?

501
01:02:05.354 --> 01:02:07.748
Just another pumped up
testosterone Tuesday


502
01:02:07.879 --> 01:02:09.315
for that fucking motherfucker!

503
01:02:11.796 --> 01:02:15.756
- Kimmy?
- It's the mask, it's the mask!


504
01:02:17.802 --> 01:02:24.286
Okay, stay close.
We'll head out the back door.


505
01:02:24.417 --> 01:02:26.201
That's what she said.

506
01:04:58.745 --> 01:05:00.442
What are we gonna do?

507
01:05:07.928 --> 01:05:10.757
The phones.
I can see them.


508
01:05:24.553 --> 01:05:26.338
Just...

509
01:06:08.859 --> 01:06:12.993
Listen to me,
you're gonna roll out


510
01:06:13.124 --> 01:06:15.996
and run for the door,
and I'll get the phones


511
01:06:16.127 --> 01:06:17.911
and call the police, okay?

512
01:06:18.042 --> 01:06:22.263
Yes, Kimmy
It's the only chance we've got!


513
01:06:22.394 --> 01:06:25.266
We've got to get those phones.

514
01:06:25.397 --> 01:06:27.442
You gonna run like hell
to the makeup room


515
01:06:27.573 --> 01:06:29.793
and lock yourself in, okay?

516
01:06:31.185 --> 01:06:33.840
It's the only chance we've got!

517
01:06:35.102 --> 01:06:36.102
Okay.

518
01:06:38.105 --> 01:06:40.760
On the count of three.

519
01:06:40.891 --> 01:06:43.589
One, two, tree.

520
01:07:06.873 --> 01:07:08.657
No!

521
01:07:14.315 --> 01:07:18.450
- Mary, it's me!
- What do we do?!


522
01:07:18.580 --> 01:07:20.713
- Where is he?
- Come on.


523
01:07:25.674 --> 01:07:28.634
Wait! Wait!

524
01:07:28.765 --> 01:07:31.419
I can hear a car,
someone's here.


525
01:07:33.160 --> 01:07:35.597
See? We're saved!

526
01:07:35.728 --> 01:07:36.749
We've gotta get out of here.

527
01:07:36.773 --> 01:07:38.165
- Get in.
- What?


528
01:07:38.296 --> 01:07:40.733
Get in.

529
01:07:40.864 --> 01:07:43.083
- What the fuck? No!
- Get in the cupboard!


530
01:07:43.214 --> 01:07:45.433
- We've gotta get outside.
- Get in!


531
01:07:45.564 --> 01:07:47.914
- Get the fuck in!
- Oh, fuck's sake!


532
01:07:48.045 --> 01:07:49.829
In! In!

533
01:07:53.877 --> 01:07:56.183
Yeah, I don't know man.

534
01:07:56.314 --> 01:07:58.882
Just doing some porno thing
that this chick set up for me.


535
01:08:00.187 --> 01:08:02.059
She, uh, kinda wants my balls,
you know?


536
01:08:04.017 --> 01:08:08.282
Yeah, I don't know like 40?

537
01:08:08.413 --> 01:08:09.675
She's pretty hot though.

538
01:08:12.504 --> 01:08:15.420
Yeah, I sold her some old mask
from the store.


539
01:08:18.423 --> 01:08:20.729
Yeah, definitely man.

540
01:08:20.860 --> 01:08:23.341
Cool. Yeah, yeah.
I'll speak to you later. Bye.


541
01:09:28.580 --> 01:09:30.321
- Come on.
- Is he gone?


542
01:09:44.683 --> 01:09:46.511
Come on.

543
01:10:36.387 --> 01:10:42.001
Okay. I'm, uh, here
to see Kimmy.


544
01:10:47.702 --> 01:10:50.749
I, uh, don't remember
this scene in Tarzan?


545
01:11:49.938 --> 01:11:52.724
You motherfucker!

546
01:14:14.605 --> 01:14:16.911
Fuck! Fuck!

547
01:14:34.451 --> 01:14:38.716
Where is it? The mask!

548
01:14:53.948 --> 01:14:55.602
I need to know
where the mask is.


549
01:14:55.733 --> 01:14:57.387
What the fuck?

550
01:14:58.692 --> 01:15:01.260
It's Otto. He's in there.

551
01:15:01.391 --> 01:15:04.394
Now listen to me girl,
that is not your friend.


552
01:15:04.524 --> 01:15:07.310
It's the mask,
the mask of the devil!


553
01:15:07.440 --> 01:15:08.572
And it's found it's way

554
01:15:08.702 --> 01:15:11.009
into this den
of inequity somehow,


555
01:15:11.139 --> 01:15:14.012
and it will kill anyone
who isn't a virgin,


556
01:15:14.142 --> 01:15:16.232
or anyone who stands in its way.

557
01:15:17.145 --> 01:15:19.017
It's cursed.

558
01:15:20.148 --> 01:15:21.976
Are you?

559
01:15:22.847 --> 01:15:24.240
Good.

560
01:15:26.720 --> 01:15:30.158
Yeah. I am.

561
01:15:30.289 --> 01:15:34.641
Then you're safe,
unless you stand in its way.


562
01:15:34.772 --> 01:15:39.037
I am the guardian,
leave this to me.


563
01:16:00.232 --> 01:16:02.103
Sweet baby Jesus!

564
01:16:06.194 --> 01:16:08.022
Todd!

565
01:16:10.764 --> 01:16:14.202
- How do you know him?
- He's my brother.


566
01:16:14.333 --> 01:16:19.251
He worked at my store.
That's it!


567
01:16:19.382 --> 01:16:20.861
What?

568
01:16:20.992 --> 01:16:23.777
He must have been the one
that sold these people the mask.


569
01:16:23.908 --> 01:16:25.562
Oh, God!

570
01:16:39.750 --> 01:16:42.883
- What is the mask?
- The mask is pure evil.


571
01:16:43.014 --> 01:16:45.321
It consumes the weak minded.

572
01:16:45.451 --> 01:16:47.540
The seekers of quick
and cheap thrills


573
01:16:47.671 --> 01:16:51.675
and turns them into
something... evil.


574
01:16:54.547 --> 01:16:57.724
Evil has no reasons.

575
01:16:57.855 --> 01:16:59.465
I have been guarding
that conduit


576
01:16:59.596 --> 01:17:01.902
for over a hundred years.

577
01:17:04.427 --> 01:17:07.343
The demon was in me.

578
01:18:12.408 --> 01:18:16.934
It's yours now, keep it safe.

579
01:18:17.064 --> 01:18:20.154
Keep it...

580
01:18:20.285 --> 01:18:22.418
Your curse is...

581
01:18:24.942 --> 01:18:28.815
No, no, no. No, no, no.

582
01:18:58.018 --> 01:18:59.846
Suck on this!

583
01:19:36.709 --> 01:19:39.538
You're not going anywhere
dressed like that, young lady!


584
01:19:39.669 --> 01:19:41.845
Your father and I have seen
all sorts of things


585
01:19:41.975 --> 01:19:44.151
over the years!

586
01:19:44.282 --> 01:19:45.152
Come on, Mary!

587
01:19:45.283 --> 01:19:46.066
Your parents
are in the other room.


588
01:19:46.197 --> 01:19:47.764
My house!

589
01:19:47.894 --> 01:19:49.176
Pre-marital relations
are the devil's work.


590
01:19:49.200 --> 01:19:50.897
Two-bit jezebel!

591
01:19:51.028 --> 01:19:52.745
And you know this is just
a fluffer's position for now?


592
01:19:52.769 --> 01:19:53.769
Lending a hand...

593
01:19:53.813 --> 01:19:55.467
What's up dickcheese?

594
01:19:55.598 --> 01:19:57.948
While I pay the bills
around here, you do as I say.


595
01:19:59.384 --> 01:20:00.492
What's your father going to say?

596
01:20:00.516 --> 01:20:03.649
That's right, no fun!

597
01:20:03.780 --> 01:20:05.912
I can't let him control me
forever.
