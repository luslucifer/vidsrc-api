1
00:00:33.407 --> 00:00:37.335
During the Civil War, the only
lawmen in Southern Texas...


2
00:00:37.375 --> 00:00:42.939
the Texas Rangers... disbanded
to fight for the Confederacy.


3
00:00:42.975 --> 00:00:47.099
Ranger Captain LeanderMcNelly
was also the local preacher.


4
00:00:47.134 --> 00:00:52.404
He left his family and ministry
to fight alongside his men.


5
00:00:52.446 --> 00:00:56.440
After the war, McNelly
returned to a defeated Texas


6
00:00:56.478 --> 00:00:59.478
and found his wife
and three sous gone...


7
00:00:59.518 --> 00:01:02.486
taken by bandits.

8
00:01:02.527 --> 00:01:04.948
In the ten years
since the war's end


9
00:01:04.991 --> 00:01:07.096
bandits have overrun
southern Texas.


10
00:01:07.135 --> 00:01:10.484
Now, the governor
is looking for McNelly.


11
00:01:10.526 --> 00:01:14.836
They say he wants to
recommission the Texas Rangers.


12
00:02:12.286 --> 00:02:13.334
Leander...

13
00:02:13.375 --> 00:02:15.262
you know,
that's a right pretty spot


14
00:02:15.295 --> 00:02:16.921
for a resting place.

15
00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:18.682
Who's the grave for?

16
00:02:18.719 --> 00:02:21.239
The grave's for me.

17
00:02:21.278 --> 00:02:22.707
Wait too long

18
00:02:22.751 --> 00:02:24.474
ground'll be froze.

19
00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:28.122
Leander, come spend the winter
at my ranch.


20
00:02:28.159 --> 00:02:30.428
You rode down,
we'd have a place for you.


21
00:02:30.462 --> 00:02:31.891
Be like old times.

22
00:02:31.934 --> 00:02:34.836
I don't reckon
I'll last the winter.


23
00:02:34.879 --> 00:02:37.017
Governor said
he sent some of his men.


24
00:02:37.055 --> 00:02:38.843
You wouldn't show at the door.

25
00:02:38.879 --> 00:02:40.821
Said maybe you'd auswer for me.

26
00:02:40.863 --> 00:02:43.863
The governor
just wants to talk with you.


27
00:02:43.902 --> 00:02:45.396
You don't got to say

28
00:02:45.439 --> 00:02:47.860
yes or no
or it's a cold September.


29
00:02:47.902 --> 00:02:50.684
All you got to do is see him,
Leander.


30
00:03:18.591 --> 00:03:20.827
Hyah! Hyah!

31
00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:35.030
And never underestimate
the importance of the name


32
00:03:35.071 --> 00:03:36.598
that you choose for a product.

33
00:03:36.639 --> 00:03:37.719
"The Dunnison and Sous

34
00:03:37.758 --> 00:03:39.547
"Automatic Drawer

35
00:03:39.582 --> 00:03:41.437
for the Tabulation
of Financial Trausactious."


36
00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:43.194
That just about tells the story,
doesn't it?


37
00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:45.085
Every shopkeeper in the country
will want one


38
00:03:45.119 --> 00:03:46.680
...Before they even see it.

39
00:03:46.718 --> 00:03:48.955
Well, that's good, because
the prototype doesn't work.


40
00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:51.129
It's a prototype, son,
it's not supposed to work.


41
00:03:51.166 --> 00:03:52.759
That's why they call it
a prototype.


42
00:03:52.799 --> 00:03:54.228
Look at this.

43
00:03:54.271 --> 00:03:55.864
I've already come np
with a solution


44
00:03:55.902 --> 00:03:57.593
to the prob...

45
00:04:01.695 --> 00:04:03.320
It's for your mother.

46
00:04:03.359 --> 00:04:06.206
Why didn't you mail it
while we were in Austin?


47
00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:07.995
You'll see.

48
00:04:33.342 --> 00:04:34.455
Past 4:00, Marshall.

49
00:04:34.495 --> 00:04:35.673
We should get started

50
00:04:35.711 --> 00:04:38.078
before these buyers
get even more nervous.


51
00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:39.288
I got a bad feeling.

52
00:04:39.326 --> 00:04:41.596
You just got to border
country today, Marshall.


53
00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:42.710
You'll get used to it.

54
00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:44.059
Coming down.

55
00:04:44.095 --> 00:04:46.910
There you go.

56
00:04:48.318 --> 00:04:49.318
Lincoln!

57
00:04:50.494 --> 00:04:52.469
Mother? Jake?

58
00:04:53.279 --> 00:04:54.522
Oh, thank goodness.

59
00:04:54.558 --> 00:04:55.600
Oh...

60
00:04:57.202 --> 00:04:58.482
Look how tall you've gotten.

61
00:04:58.622 --> 00:05:00.989
Nice hat.
...Little brother.


62
00:05:01.023 --> 00:05:02.616
What? You're going
to be a lawyer?


63
00:05:02.654 --> 00:05:04.410
I just might.
...How beautiful.


64
00:05:04.447 --> 00:05:05.461
Oh, you still quick?

65
00:05:05.502 --> 00:05:07.641
Come on, boy.

66
00:05:13.118 --> 00:05:14.460
I'd like to thank

67
00:05:14.494 --> 00:05:16.567
all of you for coming here today
for the first


68
00:05:16.606 --> 00:05:18.100
of what we hope

69
00:05:18.143 --> 00:05:19.264
will be many cattle auctious

70
00:05:19.294 --> 00:05:20.855
here in Las Coli...

71
00:05:24.351 --> 00:05:26.260
King Fisher.

72
00:05:39.007 --> 00:05:40.894
What's your business here,
Fisher?


73
00:05:40.927 --> 00:05:42.617
Come for my beeves.

74
00:05:42.655 --> 00:05:44.989
This here's an auction.

75
00:05:45.023 --> 00:05:47.292
You're welcome to bid
when the time comes.


76
00:05:47.326 --> 00:05:49.148
I bid 50.

77
00:05:49.182 --> 00:05:50.458
50 what?

78
00:05:50.494 --> 00:05:51.574
50 of them.

79
00:06:40.542 --> 00:06:42.452
Marshall, I don't
think you understand.


80
00:06:42.494 --> 00:06:45.909
Around here, I'm the law.

81
00:06:49.343 --> 00:06:51.764
Now, I'm taking my beeves home.

82
00:06:54.110 --> 00:06:56.761
I can't let you
take these cattle.


83
00:08:03.198 --> 00:08:04.573
All right, all of you,
fan out!


84
00:08:04.606 --> 00:08:07.323
Come on! Come on!

85
00:08:09.854 --> 00:08:11.032
Hyah!

86
00:08:12.830 --> 00:08:15.699
Come on, let's get out of here!

87
00:09:42.590 --> 00:09:44.859
Is anyone here?

88
00:09:58.174 --> 00:09:59.319
Don't move and I'll shoot!

89
00:10:00.446 --> 00:10:02.747
Don't move and you'll shoot?

90
00:10:02.782 --> 00:10:03.829
What does that mean?

91
00:10:03.870 --> 00:10:05.845
If I don't move,
you're going to shoot me?


92
00:10:05.886 --> 00:10:07.741
Who are you?
What are you doing here?


93
00:10:07.774 --> 00:10:10.424
My name is
Lincoln Rogers Dunnison.


94
00:10:10.462 --> 00:10:14.455
You understand, I'm not
one of the men who did this...


95
00:10:14.494 --> 00:10:17.941
so I'll be on my way.

96
00:10:24.350 --> 00:10:26.870
I can't lift it free.

97
00:10:26.910 --> 00:10:29.049
I can help you.

98
00:10:32.670 --> 00:10:34.907
Put down the gun.

99
00:10:37.918 --> 00:10:39.380
I'm from Missouri.

100
00:10:39.422 --> 00:10:41.309
We was on a cattle drive

101
00:10:41.342 --> 00:10:44.986
and stopped for supplies,
and we got ambushed.


102
00:10:45.022 --> 00:10:48.470
They stole all the cattle
and killed everybody.


103
00:10:48.510 --> 00:10:49.971
Didn't kill you.

104
00:10:50.014 --> 00:10:51.191
I was trapped...

105
00:10:51.230 --> 00:10:52.342
and they didn't see me

106
00:10:52.382 --> 00:10:54.008
and I'm damn lucky
that was the case


107
00:10:54.046 --> 00:10:55.639
otherwise, I'd be dead too.

108
00:10:55.678 --> 00:10:57.816
So, where you headed?

109
00:10:57.854 --> 00:10:59.064
Browusville.

110
00:10:59.102 --> 00:11:01.558
Browusville?
What's there?


111
00:11:01.598 --> 00:11:03.900
Texas Rangers are recruiting.

112
00:11:03.934 --> 00:11:05.625
Texas Rangers?!

113
00:11:05.662 --> 00:11:07.834
I'm going with you.

114
00:11:07.870 --> 00:11:09.593
We'll get them bandits.

115
00:11:09.630 --> 00:11:12.347
It's a long way to Browusville.

116
00:11:12.382 --> 00:11:14.487
I got a horse.

117
00:11:19.482 --> 00:11:21.587
Name's George Durham.

118
00:11:46.074 --> 00:11:47.536
Not so used

119
00:11:47.578 --> 00:11:49.520
to sleeping under the stars,
are you?


120
00:11:56.570 --> 00:12:01.077
Well...
there's nothing to it, really.


121
00:12:01.114 --> 00:12:03.536
Just, dig yourself
a little hip hole


122
00:12:03.578 --> 00:12:04.788
and then you fill a bandanna

123
00:12:04.826 --> 00:12:06.386
full of saw grass

124
00:12:06.426 --> 00:12:09.721
and stick that
underneath your head.


125
00:12:09.754 --> 00:12:12.721
It's the Lord's country,
Lincoln.


126
00:12:12.762 --> 00:12:16.656
Yeah... Lord's country.

127
00:12:16.697 --> 00:12:19.545
Land this beautiful...

128
00:12:19.577 --> 00:12:21.847
ain't no wonder

129
00:12:21.882 --> 00:12:23.889
everybody's killing over her.

130
00:12:28.154 --> 00:12:31.285
She's been here
a long time before us.


131
00:12:31.322 --> 00:12:32.467
She'll be here

132
00:12:32.506 --> 00:12:35.889
a long time to come.

133
00:12:35.930 --> 00:12:39.443
You are a philosopher,
George Durham.


134
00:12:42.394 --> 00:12:43.539
Hyah!

135
00:12:50.650 --> 00:12:51.927
Brownsville.

136
00:12:59.930 --> 00:13:01.840
We're going
to protect


137
00:13:01.882 --> 00:13:04.467
you people, least you can do

138
00:13:04.506 --> 00:13:05.880
is contribute supplies.

139
00:13:05.914 --> 00:13:07.440
You want a starving army?

140
00:13:07.482 --> 00:13:09.548
Who's going to keep
the crops safe then?


141
00:13:09.582 --> 00:13:10.678
You fellas there

142
00:13:10.713 --> 00:13:12.274
grab all the grub
you can carry.


143
00:13:12.314 --> 00:13:13.558
Get your irons and fall in.

144
00:13:13.593 --> 00:13:15.219
We're riding south
to kill bandits!


145
00:13:28.697 --> 00:13:30.520
Afternoon, Rangers.

146
00:13:32.602 --> 00:13:34.642
What's your business here?

147
00:13:34.682 --> 00:13:36.024
By order of the community

148
00:13:36.058 --> 00:13:38.131
I've got a vigilance committee
formed.


149
00:13:38.170 --> 00:13:40.537
Nary a Yankee, nigger
or Mexican among us.


150
00:13:40.570 --> 00:13:42.643
Unless you have
the authority of the state


151
00:13:42.682 --> 00:13:44.176
disband and disarm these men.

152
00:13:44.218 --> 00:13:45.744
They won't have it.

153
00:13:45.786 --> 00:13:47.193
We aim to protect our land.

154
00:13:47.226 --> 00:13:49.015
Men who want to protect
their land


155
00:13:49.050 --> 00:13:50.741
they can apply to hire from me.

156
00:13:50.777 --> 00:13:52.665
Governor's commissioned
the Rangers


157
00:13:52.697 --> 00:13:54.585
to do the protecting, mister.

158
00:13:54.617 --> 00:13:57.465
Now, you disband these men.

159
00:13:59.417 --> 00:14:01.719
You from San Antone?

160
00:14:02.714 --> 00:14:04.404
'Cause you sure as hell

161
00:14:04.442 --> 00:14:07.737
remind me
of this preacher there.


162
00:14:07.770 --> 00:14:10.225
It was some years ago...

163
00:14:10.266 --> 00:14:12.121
some preacher man.

164
00:14:12.153 --> 00:14:15.285
I don't recall no time
in San Antone.


165
00:14:15.322 --> 00:14:17.297
No, I suppose you don't.

166
00:14:23.321 --> 00:14:27.380
Men, you can keep your guns
to guard your homes


167
00:14:27.418 --> 00:14:30.352
but that means go home.

168
00:14:31.866 --> 00:14:34.648
I'll give you one minute
to take a vote.


169
00:14:51.354 --> 00:14:52.947
Hey, Preacher...

170
00:14:52.986 --> 00:14:54.327
vote's in.

171
00:15:00.218 --> 00:15:01.811
Preacher...

172
00:15:03.354 --> 00:15:04.547
say me last rites, Preacher

173
00:15:04.586 --> 00:15:05.695
before he takes me.

174
00:15:05.738 --> 00:15:07.609
I ain't no preacher.

175
00:15:12.250 --> 00:15:14.246
Company's making camp,
two nights in Brownsville.


176
00:15:14.282 --> 00:15:16.782
Any of you men interested
in taking on the star?


177
00:15:17.522 --> 00:15:20.186
West end of town's
where you'll find us.


178
00:15:20.722 --> 00:15:22.893
You look for me,
Leander McNelly


179
00:15:22.930 --> 00:15:24.042
or my associates

180
00:15:24.082 --> 00:15:26.122
Sergeant John Armstrong

181
00:15:26.162 --> 00:15:27.536
or Frank Bones.

182
00:15:36.402 --> 00:15:38.409
Hyah, hyah!

183
00:15:54.054 --> 00:15:56.836
Whoa-whoa. Whoa.

184
00:16:01.082 --> 00:16:02.489
?Habla ingles?

185
00:16:02.522 --> 00:16:04.693
?Mexicano?

186
00:16:04.729 --> 00:16:06.518
The big villas are north, yes?

187
00:16:06.553 --> 00:16:08.179
You asking or telling?

188
00:16:08.217 --> 00:16:10.673
That is what we want.

189
00:16:10.714 --> 00:16:12.983
I thought the cattles,
you drive them north, too.


190
00:16:13.017 --> 00:16:14.676
With many peoples.

191
00:16:14.714 --> 00:16:16.208
With iron trains.

192
00:16:16.249 --> 00:16:17.249
That is what we want.

193
00:16:17.274 --> 00:16:18.751
These beeves
don't speak ingles.


194
00:16:18.990 --> 00:16:21.990
They speak...
espanol.


195
00:16:22.842 --> 00:16:24.882
What do you want for her?

196
00:16:24.922 --> 00:16:26.962
The tigre is not for sale,
senor.


197
00:16:27.002 --> 00:16:28.017
What about her?

198
00:16:28.985 --> 00:16:31.669
She is my wife, senor.

199
00:16:31.705 --> 00:16:32.753
What's she do?

200
00:16:34.393 --> 00:16:35.637
What's she do?!

201
00:16:35.674 --> 00:16:37.332
She acrobat, senor.

202
00:16:37.369 --> 00:16:39.204
She spins and balances
and juggles.


203
00:16:39.237 --> 00:16:41.261
Well, if she can juggle
three balls in the air


204
00:16:41.498 --> 00:16:43.953
without dropping one of them,
you can keep your tomcat.


205
00:16:48.058 --> 00:16:50.960
Perdita, andele.

206
00:17:01.017 --> 00:17:02.326
Mas alto.

207
00:17:02.362 --> 00:17:03.409
Mas alto, Perdita.

208
00:17:11.417 --> 00:17:12.595
Catch it!

209
00:17:21.658 --> 00:17:22.738
Hyah!

210
00:17:37.786 --> 00:17:39.030
Name?

211
00:17:39.065 --> 00:17:40.592
Lincoln Rogers Dunnison.

212
00:17:41.689 --> 00:17:43.544
Where you from,
Mr. Dunnison?


213
00:17:43.578 --> 00:17:45.007
From Philadelphia, sir, as a boy

214
00:17:45.050 --> 00:17:47.701
but I spent the last three years
traveling with my father


215
00:17:47.738 --> 00:17:48.818
a salesman and inventor.

216
00:17:48.857 --> 00:17:50.101
Where's he now?

217
00:17:50.137 --> 00:17:51.447
He's dead, sir.

218
00:17:51.482 --> 00:17:53.369
He was shot down by bandits.

219
00:17:53.402 --> 00:17:54.962
Ain't no revenge riding,
Mr. Dunnison.


220
00:17:55.002 --> 00:17:56.824
Yes, sir.

221
00:17:56.857 --> 00:17:58.232
Saddle up.

222
00:18:02.682 --> 00:18:04.242
When Frank here says
draw, you draw.


223
00:18:04.281 --> 00:18:05.656
Takes longer than
a half a second


224
00:18:05.689 --> 00:18:06.900
means you're dead.

225
00:18:08.282 --> 00:18:10.737
That Ranger badge
is your target.


226
00:18:24.633 --> 00:18:25.975
Sarsaparilla.

227
00:18:28.762 --> 00:18:30.191
Most boys draw on sarsaparilla.

228
00:18:31.673 --> 00:18:32.917
Draw, damn it.

229
00:18:37.625 --> 00:18:39.186
The gun doesn't seem
to be loaded, sirs.


230
00:18:39.193 --> 00:18:41.233
Son, you might want
to cock the hammer.


231
00:18:45.978 --> 00:18:47.603
How'd he do?

232
00:18:47.642 --> 00:18:49.070
Nine seconds.

233
00:18:49.114 --> 00:18:50.121
Seen worse.

234
00:18:50.153 --> 00:18:52.460
Gentlemen, you've been gracious
to grant me your time.


235
00:18:52.602 --> 00:18:54.082
I wish you the best
in your endeavors.


236
00:18:55.257 --> 00:18:56.664
Give my best to Philadelphia.

237
00:18:59.738 --> 00:19:02.771
Just so there are
no hard feelings either way


238
00:19:02.810 --> 00:19:05.231
I didn't come here
for a mouth's pay


239
00:19:05.273 --> 00:19:06.550
or to execute some bandits

240
00:19:06.585 --> 00:19:07.731
like they did my family.

241
00:19:07.770 --> 00:19:09.592
I came here
because you sent out for men


242
00:19:09.626 --> 00:19:11.186
who wanted to protect
their land.


243
00:19:11.225 --> 00:19:13.200
I have no land but the patch

244
00:19:13.241 --> 00:19:14.518
my own two feet stand on

245
00:19:14.553 --> 00:19:16.822
but I would want that land
to be lawful, sir.


246
00:19:16.858 --> 00:19:20.119
You put that down in writing,
Mr. Dunnison?


247
00:19:20.154 --> 00:19:21.496
Sir?

248
00:19:21.529 --> 00:19:23.056
That high-minded talk.

249
00:19:23.097 --> 00:19:24.821
You write like that, too?

250
00:19:24.857 --> 00:19:28.152
In English, French or Latin?

251
00:19:28.186 --> 00:19:30.674
Well, shit, Mr. Dunnison.

252
00:19:30.714 --> 00:19:33.299
I only know Spanish,
Cherokee and Comanche.


253
00:19:33.338 --> 00:19:36.338
$40 a mouth in a state scrip
and found.


254
00:19:36.377 --> 00:19:38.450
You'll get your pay
from Sergeant Armstrong.


255
00:19:38.490 --> 00:19:39.951
You'll get your orders from me.

256
00:19:39.994 --> 00:19:41.936
We'll sell you the boots,
sell you a gun


257
00:19:41.978 --> 00:19:43.156
sell you a steed.

258
00:19:43.194 --> 00:19:44.983
But it'll run you $40,
Mr. Dunnison


259
00:19:45.017 --> 00:19:47.384
so you better last a mouth...

260
00:19:47.418 --> 00:19:50.451
'cause you're in debt to me
already.


261
00:19:52.634 --> 00:19:54.095
Here you are.

262
00:19:54.138 --> 00:19:55.250
Thanks.

263
00:19:57.465 --> 00:19:59.091
Wear it proud, son.

264
00:20:10.618 --> 00:20:12.723
Sergeant.

265
00:20:15.001 --> 00:20:16.976
Name's Sam from
S-S-San Antone.


266
00:20:17.017 --> 00:20:18.992
I never been
to S-S-San Antone.


267
00:20:19.033 --> 00:20:20.408
Randolph Douglas Scipio

268
00:20:20.441 --> 00:20:22.263
from around the Texarkana way.

269
00:20:22.298 --> 00:20:23.923
My daddy staked
some land out there.


270
00:20:23.962 --> 00:20:25.784
Turned out to find himself
a copper mine


271
00:20:25.817 --> 00:20:27.640
so they killed my daddy.

272
00:20:27.673 --> 00:20:29.844
You shouldn't be able
to just shoot a man


273
00:20:29.882 --> 00:20:30.897
and claim his land.

274
00:20:30.938 --> 00:20:32.182
Yeah.

275
00:20:32.217 --> 00:20:33.362
Yeah, I aim to change that.

276
00:20:33.402 --> 00:20:34.831
So, Sergeant say

277
00:20:34.874 --> 00:20:37.459
whether he'll use you as
a rifleman or a scout?


278
00:20:37.498 --> 00:20:40.051
A rifleman or a scout?

279
00:20:40.090 --> 00:20:42.326
Well, every white boy I met yet

280
00:20:42.362 --> 00:20:44.882
says Sergeant
made him a rifleman.


281
00:20:44.922 --> 00:20:46.994
Every colored, like me

282
00:20:47.033 --> 00:20:49.717
Sergeant made a scout.

283
00:20:49.753 --> 00:20:51.062
Well, every war I ever heard of

284
00:20:51.098 --> 00:20:52.623
scouts get killed
before the shooters


285
00:20:52.662 --> 00:20:54.998
'cause they're the stupid son
of a bitches sent out front.


286
00:20:55.034 --> 00:20:56.921
And if I don't meet
some white boy scouts soon


287
00:20:56.954 --> 00:20:59.572
President Grant's
going to be hearing from me.


288
00:20:59.609 --> 00:21:01.016
Sure.

289
00:21:01.050 --> 00:21:03.188
A strongly worded letter's
always best.


290
00:21:03.226 --> 00:21:05.877
They say I'm a scout?

291
00:21:05.913 --> 00:21:08.182
You see this star here?

292
00:21:09.850 --> 00:21:12.599
I'm gonna show them
I'm a shooter.


293
00:21:12.633 --> 00:21:14.967
Dunnison.

294
00:21:16.506 --> 00:21:17.913
What do you think?

295
00:21:19.097 --> 00:21:20.886
George!

296
00:21:20.921 --> 00:21:22.776
Lincoln! Lincoln!

297
00:21:22.809 --> 00:21:23.809
Lincoln!

298
00:21:23.834 --> 00:21:25.011
We're Rangers!

299
00:21:25.050 --> 00:21:26.064
We made it!

300
00:21:27.897 --> 00:21:29.686
We're not sleeping
under the stars.


301
00:21:29.721 --> 00:21:30.801
We got a tent.

302
00:21:30.841 --> 00:21:32.118
Oh, it's nice, too.

303
00:21:32.153 --> 00:21:33.680
You got to see it.

304
00:21:34.713 --> 00:21:35.957
It's a tent!

305
00:21:35.993 --> 00:21:38.132
I got my be...
I'm on the left!


306
00:21:38.169 --> 00:21:40.341
Fisher's been splitting

307
00:21:40.377 --> 00:21:41.806
his men into several bands.

308
00:21:41.849 --> 00:21:43.410
They've been raiding ranches

309
00:21:43.450 --> 00:21:45.359
all along this trail
on the way to Mexico.


310
00:21:45.401 --> 00:21:47.823
Captain? Mr. Dunnison's reporting, sir.

311
00:21:47.865 --> 00:21:49.043
Send him in.

312
00:21:49.081 --> 00:21:50.423
Captain.

313
00:21:50.458 --> 00:21:52.051
Sergeant said
you wanted to see me.


314
00:21:52.090 --> 00:21:53.366
Thanks, Frank.

315
00:21:55.801 --> 00:21:59.063
Take a seat, Mr. Dunnison.

316
00:21:59.098 --> 00:22:01.301
Notebook and pen are yours.

317
00:22:05.145 --> 00:22:07.698
Every word I say,
you write it down.


318
00:22:07.738 --> 00:22:10.127
Something slips by,
slow me down.


319
00:22:10.170 --> 00:22:12.079
Understood, sir.

320
00:22:12.121 --> 00:22:14.739
October 26.

321
00:22:14.777 --> 00:22:16.566
Company now fully outfitted

322
00:22:16.601 --> 00:22:18.543
with 30 men, orphans mostly.

323
00:22:18.585 --> 00:22:20.047
Youngest 15.

324
00:22:20.089 --> 00:22:23.188
We'll leave tomorrow
and train on the trail.


325
00:22:23.225 --> 00:22:26.040
Fisher split his men
into smaller raiding parties.


326
00:22:26.073 --> 00:22:28.692
Lord hope that we're
not attacked directly.


327
00:22:30.361 --> 00:22:32.750
Scant trail experience

328
00:22:32.793 --> 00:22:35.281
weakness with weapons...

329
00:22:35.321 --> 00:22:38.071
Expect desertions along the way.

330
00:22:38.106 --> 00:22:42.361
Expect... expect most of
these boys will not survive.


331
00:22:48.730 --> 00:22:49.974
Sir?

332
00:22:51.673 --> 00:22:53.167
I'm capable of writing

333
00:22:53.209 --> 00:22:55.446
my reports to the government,
Mr. Dunnison.


334
00:22:55.481 --> 00:22:57.489
But there will come a time
when I am not.


335
00:22:57.529 --> 00:23:00.017
I'd rather have you
in the habit.


336
00:23:20.537 --> 00:23:24.083
The Lord is coming for me,
Mr. Dunnison.


337
00:23:24.121 --> 00:23:27.863
Sir, then why ride?

338
00:23:27.897 --> 00:23:31.509
I figure it's better
I walk to meet Him...


339
00:23:32.921 --> 00:23:36.020
than sit and wait.

340
00:23:38.873 --> 00:23:41.012
Hey.

341
00:23:41.049 --> 00:23:43.471
What'd the captain want?

342
00:23:48.185 --> 00:23:51.219
He's dying.

343
00:23:51.257 --> 00:23:55.283
Our captain is dying.

344
00:23:55.705 --> 00:23:56.982
Rangers!

345
00:23:57.017 --> 00:24:00.432
Our mission is to stop

346
00:24:00.474 --> 00:24:02.645
the outlaw John King Fisher.

347
00:24:02.681 --> 00:24:05.267
Fisher and his men
have been burning ranches


348
00:24:05.305 --> 00:24:07.858
thieving cattle and
driving them into Mexico


349
00:24:07.898 --> 00:24:09.905
where he sells them
to the Mexican army.


350
00:24:09.945 --> 00:24:12.084
More than a million
beeves stolen.


351
00:24:12.121 --> 00:24:14.325
More than 400 men murdered.

352
00:24:14.362 --> 00:24:16.696
We'll be patrolling
border country


353
00:24:16.729 --> 00:24:18.489
to find these animals,
bring them to justice.


354
00:24:18.521 --> 00:24:20.528
U.S. Cavalry's
got a mandate


355
00:24:20.569 --> 00:24:22.479
to settle Indian matters.

356
00:24:22.521 --> 00:24:24.910
Leaves us to protect
the Texan way.


357
00:24:24.953 --> 00:24:26.546
It's our home, Rangers

358
00:24:26.585 --> 00:24:28.920
and we got right on our side.

359
00:24:28.953 --> 00:24:30.863
Ain't no outlaw
stands a fighting chance!


360
00:25:48.153 --> 00:25:49.647
Back up, recruit!

361
00:25:49.689 --> 00:25:51.347
This ain't no
goddamn pony ride.


362
00:25:51.385 --> 00:25:52.911
Who you calling recruit?

363
00:25:52.953 --> 00:25:54.162
You're a Browusville sign-up.

364
00:25:54.197 --> 00:25:55.923
I seen you. I been a Ranger
since Franklin.


365
00:25:55.961 --> 00:25:57.522
That's a week and two days.

366
00:25:57.561 --> 00:25:58.916
I know about life on the trail.

367
00:25:58.949 --> 00:26:01.105
One more week, you'll be
eligible for retirement.


368
00:26:01.241 --> 00:26:02.321
Watch it, recruit.

369
00:26:02.361 --> 00:26:03.790
I'll shoot that lip off
at 40 paces.


370
00:26:03.833 --> 00:26:06.516
Name's Berry.
Berry Smith.


371
00:26:06.553 --> 00:26:08.625
Berry? Like blueberry?

372
00:26:08.665 --> 00:26:09.941
Like elderberry to you.

373
00:26:09.977 --> 00:26:11.570
Sergeant sent me
to fill out the dab.


374
00:26:11.609 --> 00:26:13.813
Dab's a usual
three or four Rangers.


375
00:26:13.849 --> 00:26:15.191
We eat together, scout together.

376
00:26:15.225 --> 00:26:17.778
It's us three and Sandoval.

377
00:26:17.817 --> 00:26:18.929
He's dab leader.

378
00:26:18.970 --> 00:26:20.496
Means we care for his horse

379
00:26:20.537 --> 00:26:21.781
care for his weapons.

380
00:26:45.017 --> 00:26:47.635
Boy rides a horse like
he's riding his sister.


381
00:26:47.673 --> 00:26:49.527
He knows he's doing
something wrong.


382
00:26:49.561 --> 00:26:52.594
Ten cents says
he's saddle sore.


383
00:26:52.633 --> 00:26:54.738
20 cents says he's
dead by Sunday.


384
00:26:54.777 --> 00:26:56.206
Ain't taking that bet.

385
00:27:00.857 --> 00:27:03.010
Anybody see the way this scout
killed those bandits?


386
00:27:03.049 --> 00:27:04.509
Anybody see the way this scout

387
00:27:04.633 --> 00:27:06.062
killed those bandits?

388
00:27:11.705 --> 00:27:13.461
Damn!

389
00:27:13.497 --> 00:27:15.122
Sam, I'll bet you I can draw

390
00:27:15.161 --> 00:27:16.897
faster than you can say
"peppercorn."


391
00:27:16.933 --> 00:27:17.961
Peppercorn.

392
00:27:17.997 --> 00:27:19.195
Just say it.

393
00:27:19.333 --> 00:27:20.894
Pep-pep-pep-pep-pep...

394
00:27:24.568 --> 00:27:25.568
Fast!

395
00:27:25.593 --> 00:27:27.186
I'm fast, I'm fast

396
00:27:27.225 --> 00:27:29.200
I'm fast!
...So fast you're six feet under.


397
00:27:29.241 --> 00:27:31.183
Missed that target
every time, Mr. Durham.


398
00:27:31.225 --> 00:27:33.461
Gun's no good unless
you got smarts with it.


399
00:27:33.497 --> 00:27:34.511
Yes, sir, Captain.

400
00:27:34.553 --> 00:27:35.568
Frank, from now on

401
00:27:35.609 --> 00:27:38.097
Mr. Durham pays
for his ammunition.


402
00:27:38.137 --> 00:27:39.796
A penny a miss.

403
00:27:39.833 --> 00:27:41.043
Yes, sir, Captain.

404
00:27:58.873 --> 00:28:02.168
Peppercorn.

405
00:28:02.201 --> 00:28:05.943
I'm telling you,
General Cortinas


406
00:28:05.977 --> 00:28:08.246
the Republic of Texas
is there for the taking.


407
00:28:08.281 --> 00:28:11.477
What you're suggesting
is full-scale war.


408
00:28:11.513 --> 00:28:13.400
The union Army's up north,
fighting the Indians.


409
00:28:13.433 --> 00:28:15.058
Hell, there ain't no law
south of Austin.


410
00:28:15.097 --> 00:28:16.373
We heard McNelly's
been commissioned


411
00:28:16.409 --> 00:28:17.336
to start up the Rangers.

412
00:28:17.369 --> 00:28:19.474
McNelly's got 30 men,
General, 30.


413
00:28:19.513 --> 00:28:20.561
We'd have an army.

414
00:28:22.585 --> 00:28:27.255
For the next shipment, senor...

415
00:28:27.289 --> 00:28:29.623
we will meet you.

416
00:28:32.281 --> 00:28:34.037
Shit!
...Damn, Dunnison.


417
00:28:34.073 --> 00:28:35.797
Ain't there anything
you're good at?


418
00:28:35.833 --> 00:28:37.674
I'd love to show you, Scipio,
but I don't think


419
00:28:37.689 --> 00:28:39.347
we'll be meeting any women
along the way.


420
00:28:39.385 --> 00:28:41.207
Dunnison, you rope
yourself a woman


421
00:28:41.241 --> 00:28:44.340
I'll drink the Rio Grande.

422
00:28:56.313 --> 00:28:58.800
you want something, Sam?

423
00:28:58.841 --> 00:29:01.939
When you're wri-wri-writing

424
00:29:01.977 --> 00:29:03.984
for the Captain in his tent

425
00:29:04.025 --> 00:29:08.116
you see any ma-ma-maps in there?

426
00:29:08.153 --> 00:29:09.680
Maps?

427
00:29:09.721 --> 00:29:14.543
I seen the ma-maps he s-studies
with the s-sergeant


428
00:29:14.585 --> 00:29:15.894
and they're pretty b-b-b...

429
00:29:15.929 --> 00:29:18.198
Bad, Sam?

430
00:29:19.833 --> 00:29:21.972
My pa-pa-papa taught me

431
00:29:22.009 --> 00:29:25.871
how to blaze t-t-trails
and k-k-keep maps.


432
00:29:25.913 --> 00:29:28.215
Might be
wo-wo-worthwhile


433
00:29:28.249 --> 00:29:30.704
having somebody
to ma-ma-make maps


434
00:29:30.745 --> 00:29:32.239
of the t-t-territory

435
00:29:32.281 --> 00:29:34.104
while we ride.

436
00:29:34.137 --> 00:29:36.526
Captain, Mr. Walters
was speaking to me


437
00:29:36.569 --> 00:29:38.609
about the charts and maps
you're working with


438
00:29:38.649 --> 00:29:40.210
and he wanted to present you

439
00:29:40.249 --> 00:29:42.551
with what we think
is a preferable scenario.


440
00:29:42.585 --> 00:29:44.014
Sam.

441
00:29:44.056 --> 00:29:47.286
W
-W
-Well...

442
00:29:47.321 --> 00:29:50.038
Captain, I w-w-wanted

443
00:29:50.073 --> 00:29:52.920
to s-s-see...

444
00:29:52.952 --> 00:29:55.952
I w-wanted to s-see

445
00:29:55.993 --> 00:29:57.302
if you're the kind of man

446
00:29:57.337 --> 00:29:59.061
who'd beg for his
life like a dog


447
00:29:59.097 --> 00:30:01.585
or swallow the bullet
like a sorry soldier.


448
00:30:04.057 --> 00:30:06.512
Stay down!
Stay down, you son of a bitch.


449
00:30:08.440 --> 00:30:09.440
Well...

450
00:30:09.465 --> 00:30:11.920
Captain Cutthroat McNelly...

451
00:30:11.961 --> 00:30:14.710
the man the whole union
Army conldn't kill.


452
00:30:14.745 --> 00:30:17.134
Shot down by Sam Walters

453
00:30:17.177 --> 00:30:18.322
of San Antone.

454
00:30:18.361 --> 00:30:19.605
Fisher knows

455
00:30:19.641 --> 00:30:21.266
you're riding the Rangers,
Captain.


456
00:30:21.305 --> 00:30:22.895
He's put a sweet price
on your sad hide.


457
00:30:25.173 --> 00:30:26.394
Suck my spurs, you secretary!

458
00:30:26.425 --> 00:30:28.661
I brought a bullet
for you, too.


459
00:30:29.849 --> 00:30:31.158
Turn around, McNelly.

460
00:30:31.193 --> 00:30:32.884
And stop your shifting
or I'll shoot.


461
00:30:32.920 --> 00:30:36.914
Brave Sam Walters...
shot McNelly in the back.


462
00:30:38.169 --> 00:30:40.406
How's that for a storybook?

463
00:30:40.441 --> 00:30:42.710
Turn around, McNelly.

464
00:30:42.745 --> 00:30:44.720
Right in the back,
Sam shot him.


465
00:30:44.761 --> 00:30:46.102
Right in the back.

466
00:30:46.137 --> 00:30:47.479
I said

467
00:30:47.513 --> 00:30:48.528
turn around!

468
00:31:31.353 --> 00:31:33.873
you riding somewheres,
Mr. Dunnison?


469
00:31:35.129 --> 00:31:37.038
Riding out
of Ranger Company, sir.


470
00:31:37.081 --> 00:31:39.318
Company's captain

471
00:31:39.353 --> 00:31:41.524
was nearly killed
due to my conduct.


472
00:31:41.561 --> 00:31:44.561
I don't presume myself welcome
to wear this anymore.


473
00:31:47.417 --> 00:31:50.865
Were you set to ride off
with that horse, Mr. Dunnison?


474
00:31:50.905 --> 00:31:52.760
That's a Ranger's horse.

475
00:31:52.793 --> 00:31:55.314
I was hoping I would not be
sent away without a horse, sir.


476
00:31:55.353 --> 00:31:57.076
But hoping to be sent away?

477
00:31:57.113 --> 00:32:01.782
You were nearly killed,
and I was the reason.


478
00:32:01.817 --> 00:32:03.759
I hired Sam Walters on,
Mr. Dunnison.


479
00:32:03.801 --> 00:32:05.295
He stood my scrutiny.

480
00:32:05.336 --> 00:32:07.889
He could've taken his shot at me
at any time.


481
00:32:07.929 --> 00:32:10.318
He had 30 Rangers shined on,
not just you.


482
00:32:10.361 --> 00:32:12.368
Rangers' horse,
Mr. Dunnison.


483
00:32:12.408 --> 00:32:15.256
You ride out,
that horse is stolen.


484
00:32:15.288 --> 00:32:17.328
My men will hunt you down.

485
00:32:17.369 --> 00:32:20.598
Rangers' boots, Rangers'
clothes, Rangers' weapons.


486
00:32:20.633 --> 00:32:23.088
You walk out,
makes them stolen, too.


487
00:32:23.129 --> 00:32:24.852
So it seems to me,
Mr. Dunnison


488
00:32:24.888 --> 00:32:26.743
the only way you
escape a warrant


489
00:32:26.777 --> 00:32:28.370
is to remain a Ranger.

490
00:32:50.521 --> 00:32:53.303
Fisher keeps an outpost
around this mesa.


491
00:32:53.336 --> 00:32:56.151
Freshwater spring
on the other side.


492
00:32:56.185 --> 00:32:59.316
Water for the horses when
they come from raids.


493
00:32:59.352 --> 00:33:02.069
But do we know how many?

494
00:33:02.105 --> 00:33:03.566
Shouldn't we know how many?

495
00:33:03.609 --> 00:33:04.918
Round that mesa

496
00:33:04.952 --> 00:33:06.513
they'll spot us well too soon.

497
00:33:06.553 --> 00:33:07.862
Need to send a patrol.

498
00:33:07.897 --> 00:33:11.759
Berry, Durham, Dunnison

499
00:33:11.801 --> 00:33:13.077
ride with Sandoval and me.

500
00:33:13.113 --> 00:33:15.731
Taking a scout, Captain?

501
00:33:17.273 --> 00:33:18.866
Get yourself shot.

502
00:33:18.904 --> 00:33:21.174
Scipio, go get yourself shot.

503
00:33:21.209 --> 00:33:23.926
And don't get shot second;
get shot first, Scipio.


504
00:33:23.960 --> 00:33:25.935
In fact, shoot yourself, Scipio.

505
00:33:25.976 --> 00:33:27.635
Get it over with.

506
00:33:27.673 --> 00:33:30.007
That's the Rangers' way.

507
00:33:53.560 --> 00:33:55.502
Five men. Fisher's men, sir.

508
00:33:55.545 --> 00:33:58.000
Armed, and they got
a supply wagon.


509
00:33:59.001 --> 00:34:00.790
Sandoval.
...Yes, sir.


510
00:34:01.721 --> 00:34:03.859
Our mission is

511
00:34:03.897 --> 00:34:05.490
to capture these men
at all costs.


512
00:34:05.529 --> 00:34:07.733
But I want the cost
to be on their side.


513
00:34:07.768 --> 00:34:09.327
When the shooting starts,
these targets


514
00:34:09.365 --> 00:34:11.223
will be shooting back...
not like practice, men.


515
00:34:11.261 --> 00:34:12.721
Anyone surrenders,
we question them


516
00:34:12.760 --> 00:34:14.287
then send them to
Austin for trial.


517
00:34:14.328 --> 00:34:15.473
Remember...

518
00:34:15.513 --> 00:34:17.684
you hesitate, you're dead.

519
00:34:31.256 --> 00:34:33.460
Where are you wandering
off to?


520
00:34:33.497 --> 00:34:34.707
Cheval?

521
00:34:34.744 --> 00:34:36.435
What woman

522
00:34:36.473 --> 00:34:37.683
lost hold of you?

523
00:34:37.720 --> 00:34:40.022
Drop your guns! Stay down!

524
00:34:40.056 --> 00:34:41.366
Texas Rangers!

525
00:34:43.544 --> 00:34:45.039
Say your prayers,
sons of bitches!


526
00:34:45.081 --> 00:34:46.081
Ambush!

527
00:35:18.617 --> 00:35:21.966
Someone throw me a cartridge!
I'm out!


528
00:35:22.009 --> 00:35:23.732
Someone throw me

529
00:35:23.769 --> 00:35:24.946
a cartridge!

530
00:35:29.849 --> 00:35:31.507
Found one.

531
00:35:39.224 --> 00:35:40.785
Wha...

532
00:35:56.409 --> 00:35:57.652
...Get down!

533
00:36:12.249 --> 00:36:15.216
You said there were
five men! Five!


534
00:36:15.257 --> 00:36:16.566
I ain't no scout!

535
00:36:16.600 --> 00:36:17.942
You hear me?
I ain't no scout!


536
00:36:17.976 --> 00:36:19.220
I'm a dag-blasted shooter!

537
00:36:19.257 --> 00:36:20.271
Give me that!

538
00:36:29.209 --> 00:36:30.965
We surrender.

539
00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:32.822
We surrender.

540
00:36:36.953 --> 00:36:39.855
So, ladies, where to next?

541
00:36:41.337 --> 00:36:42.744
Say your names.

542
00:36:42.776 --> 00:36:44.631
Anton Marsele,
from New Orleans.


543
00:36:44.665 --> 00:36:46.574
Jean-Pierre Marsele.
Son frere.


544
00:36:46.616 --> 00:36:49.169
Marsele brothers.

545
00:36:49.208 --> 00:36:51.761
Horse thievery and livestock

546
00:36:51.801 --> 00:36:53.743
extortion of
merchants and widows


547
00:36:53.784 --> 00:36:55.410
kidnapping...

548
00:36:55.449 --> 00:36:57.751
destruction of property.

549
00:36:57.784 --> 00:36:59.410
You boys should've stayed
in New Orleans.


550
00:36:59.448 --> 00:37:01.368
Why don't you give us
some more to write in here?


551
00:37:04.729 --> 00:37:06.151
Attendez! Attendez! Attendez!

552
00:37:06.184 --> 00:37:07.433
We rode for King Fisher.

553
00:37:07.576 --> 00:37:08.918
The saddles were stole

554
00:37:08.952 --> 00:37:10.610
from Sutter Ranch in Austin.

555
00:37:10.649 --> 00:37:12.242
With cattle, 400 head.

556
00:37:12.280 --> 00:37:14.614
Ten ranch hands died
at the Sutter Ranch.


557
00:37:14.649 --> 00:37:15.794
We kill no one.

558
00:37:15.832 --> 00:37:17.109
Fisher did.

559
00:37:17.144 --> 00:37:18.157
We work for you now.

560
00:37:18.196 --> 00:37:19.245
For you.
...Oui.


561
00:37:19.289 --> 00:37:21.077
You work for the Rangers
as a spy?


562
00:37:21.087 --> 00:37:22.527
Oui.
...Oui. Oni, for the Rangers.


563
00:37:22.552 --> 00:37:23.567
For the Rangers.

564
00:37:23.608 --> 00:37:24.983
Ca va marcher, ca va marcher.

565
00:37:25.016 --> 00:37:26.377
Ils savent pas
a propos des antres.


566
00:37:26.392 --> 00:37:27.799
C'etait pas marqne
daus le mandat.


567
00:37:27.833 --> 00:37:29.491
Mr. Dunnison?

568
00:37:29.528 --> 00:37:31.568
Sir?
...What'd they say?


569
00:37:31.609 --> 00:37:33.878
They said, "This will work,
this will work."


570
00:37:33.912 --> 00:37:35.734
"They don't know
about the others.


571
00:37:35.769 --> 00:37:37.776
It wasn't in the warrants."

572
00:37:40.601 --> 00:37:41.811
Sandoval.

573
00:37:51.192 --> 00:37:53.363
These bandits
went down shooting.


574
00:37:53.401 --> 00:37:54.862
Surrender never crossed
their minds.


575
00:37:54.905 --> 00:37:56.847
Their rules, not mine.

576
00:37:56.889 --> 00:37:58.350
But I'll play by them.

577
00:37:58.393 --> 00:38:00.149
We're Rangers, men.

578
00:38:00.184 --> 00:38:03.446
We got right on our side.

579
00:38:06.392 --> 00:38:08.847
Scipio.

580
00:38:12.824 --> 00:38:15.213
Treat her fine...

581
00:38:15.256 --> 00:38:16.718
rifleman.

582
00:38:21.144 --> 00:38:23.926
You said we would take
those men prisoner


583
00:38:23.961 --> 00:38:26.382
take them to Austin,
take them to trial.


584
00:38:26.424 --> 00:38:28.846
We did the trial.

585
00:38:28.888 --> 00:38:30.449
That was no trial.

586
00:38:30.489 --> 00:38:34.318
A trial can run a long
time, Mr. Dunnison.


587
00:38:34.360 --> 00:38:36.368
Some can run up to a year.

588
00:38:40.056 --> 00:38:42.642
A year is something
I do not have.


589
00:38:42.680 --> 00:38:44.436
In the state of Texas,
killers hang.


590
00:38:44.473 --> 00:38:46.960
And if they're not killers,
but we think they're killers


591
00:38:47.001 --> 00:38:49.586
and we don't even stop
to check the warrants?


592
00:38:49.625 --> 00:38:51.959
How long will the war go on...

593
00:38:51.992 --> 00:38:53.967
preacher?

594
00:38:58.104 --> 00:39:00.243
Until the wicked are dead

595
00:39:00.280 --> 00:39:02.452
and the meek shall
inherit the earth.


596
00:39:02.488 --> 00:39:04.692
Are we the meek?

597
00:39:04.728 --> 00:39:07.958
The meek will inherit the earth,
Mr. Dunnison.


598
00:39:07.992 --> 00:39:11.341
Someone's got to go
and get it ready for them.


599
00:39:11.384 --> 00:39:13.424
There are bodies

600
00:39:13.464 --> 00:39:15.799
to be buried.

601
00:39:15.832 --> 00:39:17.458
Bury them.

602
00:39:49.368 --> 00:39:51.277
Some kind of work, ain't it?

603
00:39:51.321 --> 00:39:55.314
We done killed six men dead.

604
00:39:55.352 --> 00:39:58.931
We ain't even got our $40 yet.

605
00:40:14.296 --> 00:40:18.290
< <

606
00:40:38.232 --> 00:40:40.883
Cattle come through here.

607
00:40:40.920 --> 00:40:43.124
100, maybe 200.

608
00:40:48.632 --> 00:40:51.796
Whoa, now! Get on back!

609
00:40:56.280 --> 00:40:59.728
Rangers got
the Marsele brothers.


610
00:40:59.768 --> 00:41:01.426
What about the gun?

611
00:41:01.464 --> 00:41:03.602
McNelly destroyed it.

612
00:41:04.824 --> 00:41:06.253
Damn.

613
00:41:12.440 --> 00:41:14.033
30 men and horses.

614
00:41:14.072 --> 00:41:15.982
About a hundred beeves.

615
00:41:16.024 --> 00:41:18.479
You know that's
marshland prairie, Captain.


616
00:41:18.520 --> 00:41:21.554
Might want to track them
to a little better terrain.


617
00:41:21.592 --> 00:41:24.014
No better terrain for 20 miles.

618
00:41:24.056 --> 00:41:26.641
And better for us
means better for them.


619
00:41:26.680 --> 00:41:27.825
Might be better to wait.

620
00:41:27.864 --> 00:41:30.253
Wait till what,
they reach reinforcements?


621
00:41:30.296 --> 00:41:31.573
Sandoval??

622
00:41:31.608 --> 00:41:36.365
30 of them, 30 of us.

623
00:41:36.408 --> 00:41:40.303
We wait...
they may have 300.


624
00:41:47.608 --> 00:41:50.510
We'll ride at full gallop.

625
00:41:50.552 --> 00:41:52.046
They'll see us on the prairie

626
00:41:52.089 --> 00:41:53.583
and take defensive positions.

627
00:41:53.624 --> 00:41:55.180
Shoot at the target
forward of you only


628
00:41:55.217 --> 00:41:56.365
and you keep shooting

629
00:41:56.408 --> 00:41:58.797
till you taste that
outlaw's blood.


630
00:41:58.840 --> 00:42:01.175
No prisoners, Rangers.

631
00:42:31.416 --> 00:42:32.416
Fire!

632
00:42:51.480 --> 00:42:52.887
Hyah!

633
00:42:55.096 --> 00:42:56.273
Get every last one!

634
00:43:04.984 --> 00:43:07.089
Get the others out of hiding.

635
00:43:13.816 --> 00:43:15.704
Let's go, boys!

636
00:43:29.368 --> 00:43:30.710
Jesus Christ.

637
00:43:47.608 --> 00:43:49.364
We don't have the manpower.

638
00:43:49.400 --> 00:43:51.124
They set us up!
We're trapped!


639
00:44:06.040 --> 00:44:07.828
Goddamn.

640
00:44:15.768 --> 00:44:17.077
God, not me.

641
00:44:17.112 --> 00:44:19.795
Oh, please God!

642
00:44:19.832 --> 00:44:21.261
Oye, muchacho, por aca.

643
00:44:23.447 --> 00:44:24.447
Stand back!

644
00:44:24.472 --> 00:44:25.716
Stand back!

645
00:44:27.512 --> 00:44:28.919
Don't move!

646
00:44:31.544 --> 00:44:33.966
Oh, God! Oh, God! Get up!

647
00:44:45.048 --> 00:44:47.088
Leave them alone!

648
00:44:47.128 --> 00:44:48.557
Their dead alone!

649
00:45:03.128 --> 00:45:04.176
No!

650
00:45:09.400 --> 00:45:11.025
Sergeant!

651
00:45:11.064 --> 00:45:12.373
I'm getting you out of here.

652
00:45:12.408 --> 00:45:14.645
Help me! I surrender!

653
00:45:14.680 --> 00:45:15.727
Help me!

654
00:45:15.768 --> 00:45:16.780
I surrender!

655
00:45:16.820 --> 00:45:17.814
Help me!

656
00:45:17.848 --> 00:45:19.735
I surren...

657
00:45:21.528 --> 00:45:22.804
Retreat, Rangers!

658
00:45:22.840 --> 00:45:24.050
Retreat!

659
00:45:43.448 --> 00:45:44.837
Durham:
Thank God!


660
00:45:44.872 --> 00:45:46.120
We're retreating!

661
00:45:46.264 --> 00:45:48.086
Come on!
We're retreating!


662
00:45:48.120 --> 00:45:49.364
We're retreating!

663
00:45:49.400 --> 00:45:50.513
Giddup! Let's go!

664
00:45:59.480 --> 00:46:01.684
Next time you train your Rangers

665
00:46:01.720 --> 00:46:03.094
train them how to run!

666
00:46:03.128 --> 00:46:04.983
Go with God, McNelly.

667
00:46:05.016 --> 00:46:07.700
If the son of a bitch
will have you.


668
00:46:09.880 --> 00:46:12.083
Ride.

669
00:46:46.200 --> 00:46:49.135
Thank you very much.

670
00:47:01.848 --> 00:47:05.164
Fisher will have
ridden on by dusk.


671
00:47:05.208 --> 00:47:07.891
We'll return to Palo Alto...

672
00:47:07.928 --> 00:47:10.383
get our men.

673
00:47:10.424 --> 00:47:13.009
We'll resupply
and get new recruits


674
00:47:13.048 --> 00:47:14.935
at the ranch of my old friend

675
00:47:14.968 --> 00:47:16.212
Richard Dukes.

676
00:47:32.728 --> 00:47:34.703
What'd they do with our men?

677
00:47:35.832 --> 00:47:37.970
Cap...

678
00:47:56.183 --> 00:47:59.031
Cut my men down.

679
00:47:59.063 --> 00:48:01.519
Cut them down.

680
00:48:12.536 --> 00:48:14.641
Jesus...

681
00:48:25.720 --> 00:48:26.865
Captain!

682
00:48:26.903 --> 00:48:28.445
Or favor...

683
00:48:28.488 --> 00:48:29.715
kill me.

684
00:48:29.848 --> 00:48:30.927
Captain!

685
00:48:30.968 --> 00:48:32.244
Kill me now.

686
00:48:32.280 --> 00:48:33.490
Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa!

687
00:48:33.527 --> 00:48:35.699
Slow and easy,
?comprende?


688
00:48:35.736 --> 00:48:37.809
Nice and easy, little lady.

689
00:48:37.848 --> 00:48:39.092
Your war's over.

690
00:48:41.496 --> 00:48:43.351
Slow and easy.

691
00:49:01.336 --> 00:49:02.863
Riders coming in!

692
00:49:02.904 --> 00:49:04.148
Ready yourselves!

693
00:49:04.184 --> 00:49:06.486
Begging your pardon,
Mrs. Dukes.


694
00:49:06.519 --> 00:49:08.178
There's riders, Captain.

695
00:49:19.863 --> 00:49:22.580
Whoa.

696
00:49:28.376 --> 00:49:30.318
Are those the Rangers, Daddy?

697
00:49:30.360 --> 00:49:32.531
Caroline,
take your sisters inside.


698
00:49:32.568 --> 00:49:34.128
Come on, girls.
There's going to be


699
00:49:34.168 --> 00:49:35.662
a lot of dirty cowboys around.

700
00:49:42.008 --> 00:49:44.626
Got 12 men to bury.

701
00:50:05.943 --> 00:50:09.107
You want to say
some words, Leander?


702
00:50:30.360 --> 00:50:31.734
you're welcome, sir.

703
00:50:37.879 --> 00:50:40.149
Oh, thank you, ma'am.

704
00:50:40.184 --> 00:50:42.093
No, no.

705
00:50:48.439 --> 00:50:50.195
Thank you, ma'am.

706
00:50:50.232 --> 00:50:51.693
Tom?

707
00:50:54.936 --> 00:50:56.823
Wouldn't be so bad
to be a ranch hand


708
00:50:56.856 --> 00:50:58.001
around here, would it?

709
00:50:58.039 --> 00:50:59.534
Probably don't
get shot at much.


710
00:50:59.576 --> 00:51:00.983
I wouldn't even mind, as long

711
00:51:01.015 --> 00:51:02.739
as it was her
doing the shooting.


712
00:51:04.055 --> 00:51:05.844
Durham:
up there earlier


713
00:51:05.880 --> 00:51:09.295
she was studying me
like an encyclopedia.


714
00:51:09.336 --> 00:51:12.183
I hate to disappoint you,
George, but she was eyeing me.


715
00:51:12.216 --> 00:51:13.345
The hell she was!

716
00:51:13.388 --> 00:51:15.117
She was. She was
studying me like a Bible.

717
00:51:15.159 --> 00:51:17.134
Well, you study an encyclopedia
a lot harder


718
00:51:17.175 --> 00:51:18.469
than you study a Bible, Lincoln.

719
00:51:18.512 --> 00:51:20.304
Get all that buckshot
out of your ass yet?


720
00:51:20.344 --> 00:51:21.904
Ten more minutes.

721
00:51:21.943 --> 00:51:23.405
Ten more minutes
is about how long


722
00:51:23.447 --> 00:51:24.808
you got to live,
unless you give up


723
00:51:24.848 --> 00:51:26.706
that bath to the man who
could've killed you


724
00:51:26.743 --> 00:51:27.820
when he met you.

725
00:51:27.855 --> 00:51:29.750
George, you couldn't kill
a bottle of mescal


726
00:51:29.792 --> 00:51:31.632
with a pack of Mexicans.
...Give up the bath.


727
00:51:31.672 --> 00:51:32.948
What the hell are you doing?

728
00:51:32.984 --> 00:51:35.056
Get the hell out of here!
...Give up the bath!


729
00:51:35.096 --> 00:51:37.616
Have a seat, sonny.
Just stay on your side!


730
00:51:46.552 --> 00:51:47.697
Oh, you had to see that.

731
00:51:47.736 --> 00:51:49.623
She was eyeing me.

732
00:51:56.535 --> 00:51:58.128
Come in.

733
00:52:00.056 --> 00:52:01.965
Mr. Dunnison.

734
00:52:12.471 --> 00:52:15.122
November 17.

735
00:52:15.160 --> 00:52:18.324
The men fought bravely,
but I believe it was my mistake


736
00:52:18.360 --> 00:52:20.749
to lead them into a battle
on such arduous terrain.


737
00:52:22.423 --> 00:52:24.693
With no natural defencements,
they were unprepared


738
00:52:24.728 --> 00:52:26.637
to withstand
such a pitched encounter.


739
00:52:26.680 --> 00:52:29.200
I had believed that the numbers
were in our favor.


740
00:52:29.239 --> 00:52:30.832
I had believed that the raiders

741
00:52:30.872 --> 00:52:32.279
would not be as
well-disciplined


742
00:52:32.311 --> 00:52:34.286
as they were.

743
00:52:36.311 --> 00:52:39.159
It was a disastrous decision.

744
00:52:45.880 --> 00:52:48.181
Would you agree with that,
Mr. Dunnison?


745
00:52:50.936 --> 00:52:52.910
It's awfully kind of you, Miss

746
00:52:52.952 --> 00:52:54.959
to be taking care of
such wrecks like us.


747
00:52:54.999 --> 00:52:56.177
Awfully kind.

748
00:52:56.215 --> 00:52:57.971
Well, it must've been hard.

749
00:52:58.008 --> 00:52:59.977
Were many young like you?

750
00:53:00.001 --> 00:53:02.406
Rest assured, Miss, we didn't
go down without a fight.


751
00:53:02.456 --> 00:53:04.398
I killed two raiders
myself at close range.


752
00:53:04.440 --> 00:53:06.545
I may have killed a couple
more in the charge.


753
00:53:08.632 --> 00:53:10.006
What were their names?

754
00:53:10.040 --> 00:53:11.731
Pardon?

755
00:53:11.768 --> 00:53:13.426
You had warrants for them,
I trust.


756
00:53:13.464 --> 00:53:15.351
Well, the raiders opened
fire on us, Miss.


757
00:53:15.384 --> 00:53:17.358
There wasn't time to
consult the warrants.


758
00:53:17.399 --> 00:53:18.709
Well, it's just as well.

759
00:53:18.743 --> 00:53:20.234
You know a man's name,
makes it harder


760
00:53:20.271 --> 00:53:21.519
to kill him, now, doesn't it?

761
00:53:21.560 --> 00:53:23.120
They're outlaws, Miss.

762
00:53:23.159 --> 00:53:24.654
We're Rangers.

763
00:53:24.696 --> 00:53:26.801
When you kill a man
for stealing some cattle


764
00:53:26.839 --> 00:53:29.425
you are saying that his life
is worth as much as that steer.


765
00:53:29.463 --> 00:53:31.852
Leaves you a whole state
full of men thinking that way


766
00:53:31.895 --> 00:53:33.651
and treating other men
the same.


767
00:53:33.688 --> 00:53:37.136
We ride to protect
the state of Texas.


768
00:53:37.176 --> 00:53:39.281
You ride to balance
the blood on the scales.


769
00:53:39.319 --> 00:53:42.221
But some of you...

770
00:53:42.264 --> 00:53:44.173
like your friend...

771
00:53:44.215 --> 00:53:46.484
I look into his eyes,
and I can see it clear.


772
00:53:46.520 --> 00:53:47.730
He's no killer.

773
00:53:47.767 --> 00:53:50.484
George? You looked in his eyes?

774
00:53:51.832 --> 00:53:53.971
George?!

775
00:53:56.824 --> 00:53:58.798
Durham:
Miss.


776
00:53:58.840 --> 00:54:00.334
Ladies.

777
00:54:00.375 --> 00:54:01.520
Hey.

778
00:54:01.559 --> 00:54:02.737
You talking to her?

779
00:54:02.775 --> 00:54:05.492
I got nowhere, George.

780
00:54:05.528 --> 00:54:06.902
Gunslingers.

781
00:54:06.936 --> 00:54:09.041
She likes gunslingers.

782
00:54:20.216 --> 00:54:22.255
Sergeant, what's going on?

783
00:54:22.296 --> 00:54:24.881
Training exercises,
it looks like.


784
00:54:24.920 --> 00:54:26.261
Who organized this?

785
00:54:26.295 --> 00:54:27.539
Philadelphia did.

786
00:54:27.575 --> 00:54:28.786
About damn time.

787
00:54:30.520 --> 00:54:32.046
Peppercorn.

788
00:54:37.591 --> 00:54:39.958
State'll pay you $40 a mouth.

789
00:54:39.991 --> 00:54:41.780
Four men to a dab.

790
00:54:41.815 --> 00:54:43.473
Seven dabs to a company.

791
00:54:43.512 --> 00:54:45.486
You get your pay
from Sergeant Armstrong.


792
00:54:46.904 --> 00:54:48.627
You get your orders from me.

793
00:54:48.664 --> 00:54:49.664
Fire!

794
00:55:29.975 --> 00:55:32.397
Senorita.

795
00:55:35.864 --> 00:55:37.773
Si.

796
00:55:40.279 --> 00:55:42.384
La Senora wanted you
to have these.


797
00:55:42.424 --> 00:55:43.885
They're yours to keep.

798
00:55:43.927 --> 00:55:46.775
You're safe now.

799
00:55:46.807 --> 00:55:48.596
You're with the Rangers.

800
00:55:48.631 --> 00:55:50.290
Those devils
can't hurt you anymore.


801
00:55:50.327 --> 00:55:52.018
Who say they cannot hurt me
no more?


802
00:55:52.055 --> 00:55:54.422
John Armstrong says.

803
00:55:59.671 --> 00:56:01.165
Senora is...

804
00:56:01.207 --> 00:56:03.029
very kind.

805
00:56:10.903 --> 00:56:12.561
Who were those men?

806
00:56:12.600 --> 00:56:15.218
Name to me
the devils that hurt you.


807
00:56:17.015 --> 00:56:19.765
We're after those men.

808
00:56:21.303 --> 00:56:23.670
I heard them say they were going
to Amargosa


809
00:56:23.704 --> 00:56:27.052
to do a raid at
the Logan ranch.


810
00:56:37.015 --> 00:56:39.087
Thank you.

811
00:56:44.126 --> 00:56:46.367
Come on, recruits,
let's get ready to move out!


812
00:56:46.392 --> 00:56:48.595
Come on, pack it up!

813
00:56:48.631 --> 00:56:51.566
Let's get ready
to move out, boys.


814
00:56:53.175 --> 00:56:54.997
Let's pack her up!

815
00:56:58.328 --> 00:57:00.215
Saying good-bye?

816
00:57:02.775 --> 00:57:04.182
We...

817
00:57:04.215 --> 00:57:06.997
shot five bandits
over at Palo Alto.


818
00:57:07.031 --> 00:57:09.714
Well, I mean...

819
00:57:09.751 --> 00:57:11.311
I killed.

820
00:57:11.351 --> 00:57:12.529
Judy didn't.

821
00:57:13.815 --> 00:57:16.532
But I was riding Judy.

822
00:57:16.568 --> 00:57:19.055
Hell, they was dead before they
even saw me draw. Blam, blam!


823
00:57:19.095 --> 00:57:22.095
George, sell it
in the dime stores.


824
00:57:26.999 --> 00:57:30.861
She'd... make
a good ranch horse.


825
00:57:30.903 --> 00:57:34.482
I think you'd make
a good ranch hand.


826
00:57:37.335 --> 00:57:38.895
Dunnison:
Miss Dnkes


827
00:57:38.935 --> 00:57:40.790
hope he hasn't tired you
with all his stories:


828
00:57:40.823 --> 00:57:43.212
all the bad men he's killed,
the hangings, the shoot-outs.


829
00:57:43.255 --> 00:57:45.011
It's so hard to keep track.

830
00:57:45.047 --> 00:57:47.055
Actually, we were speaking
of a horse.


831
00:57:47.095 --> 00:57:49.648
He killed a horse?

832
00:57:50.807 --> 00:57:52.182
Miss Dukes.

833
00:57:56.888 --> 00:57:58.895
Amargosa's a 40-mile ride

834
00:57:58.935 --> 00:58:00.845
but we'll make it by nightfall.

835
00:58:00.887 --> 00:58:02.065
Send a man into Shepardton.

836
00:58:02.103 --> 00:58:03.477
Get a telegram to Victor Logan.

837
00:58:03.511 --> 00:58:05.299
Tell him to get his
family out of there.


838
00:58:05.335 --> 00:58:06.579
And the Rangers are coming.

839
00:58:13.623 --> 00:58:15.990
I made the lady a
promise, Captain.


840
00:58:16.023 --> 00:58:18.838
We're taking her to Carmargo.

841
00:58:23.223 --> 00:58:24.433
Hyah.

842
00:59:07.127 --> 00:59:08.850
Another hour

843
00:59:08.888 --> 00:59:10.676
and it's sunup.

844
00:59:10.711 --> 00:59:13.460
Any sign over there?

845
00:59:13.495 --> 00:59:15.437
Dust, Captain.

846
00:59:15.479 --> 00:59:17.650
Dust and sky.

847
00:59:17.687 --> 00:59:19.891
Night... why
wouldn't they


848
00:59:19.927 --> 00:59:21.137
raid at night?

849
00:59:28.503 --> 00:59:30.096
She wasn't dead.

850
00:59:32.375 --> 00:59:33.521
I don't follow.

851
00:59:33.559 --> 00:59:35.414
The rest were dead.

852
00:59:35.447 --> 00:59:37.651
And she wasn't.

853
00:59:37.688 --> 00:59:39.062
So why'd they leave her behind?

854
00:59:41.847 --> 00:59:43.734
Hey, Captain!

855
00:59:43.767 --> 00:59:45.374
Captain, wait up!

856
00:59:47.848 --> 00:59:49.075
They let you live! Why?

857
00:59:49.208 --> 00:59:50.702
To say what? What?!

858
00:59:50.743 --> 00:59:52.270
Stop! You're scaring her!
...Amargosa?


859
00:59:52.311 --> 00:59:53.489
Le diije qne no se!

860
00:59:53.527 --> 00:59:55.469
Captain, she told you
what she heard them say!


861
00:59:55.511 --> 00:59:57.683
What they wanted her to hear!

862
00:59:57.719 --> 01:00:00.719
What they wanted her to say!

863
01:00:02.327 --> 01:00:05.327
Rangers!

864
01:00:09.975 --> 01:00:11.535
Men, we are riding back
to Dukes.


865
01:00:11.575 --> 01:00:12.917
Dunnison, Donavan, Scipio

866
01:00:12.951 --> 01:00:14.740
stay behind
with Sergeant Armstrong.


867
01:00:14.775 --> 01:00:16.717
Take Perdita as our prisoner.

868
01:00:16.759 --> 01:00:18.515
Yeah, but what if
they still raid?


869
01:00:18.551 --> 01:00:19.980
We're not at the raid,
goddamn it!


870
01:00:20.023 --> 01:00:21.965
The raid can only be
at the Dukes Ranch!


871
01:00:22.007 --> 01:00:23.916
Hyah. Hyah!

872
01:00:53.623 --> 01:00:56.657
Perdita.

873
01:00:56.695 --> 01:00:58.037
You didn't know.

874
01:00:58.071 --> 01:01:00.177
You conldn't have.

875
01:01:03.063 --> 01:01:05.780
Please forgive me.

876
01:01:18.903 --> 01:01:21.324
Hyah! Hyah!

877
01:01:21.367 --> 01:01:22.796
Andale, mas rapido!

878
01:01:22.839 --> 01:01:24.627
Ho! Ho!

879
01:01:26.487 --> 01:01:28.625
Rapido, ho!

880
01:01:30.167 --> 01:01:31.727
Duncan!

881
01:01:41.591 --> 01:01:43.500
Scipio!

882
01:01:43.543 --> 01:01:45.267
Hyah!

883
01:01:45.303 --> 01:01:46.481
Hyah! Hyah!

884
01:01:48.343 --> 01:01:51.409
Hyah! Hyah! Hyah!

885
01:01:51.447 --> 01:01:53.138
Yo, andale.

886
01:01:55.607 --> 01:01:57.844
Yo, andale.

887
01:01:59.223 --> 01:02:00.223
1Andale!

888
01:02:01.719 --> 01:02:02.734
1Arriba, arriba!

889
01:02:04.567 --> 01:02:06.542
1Andale!

890
01:02:08.343 --> 01:02:09.750
Hyah! Hyah!

891
01:02:09.783 --> 01:02:10.993
Hyah!

892
01:02:11.031 --> 01:02:12.558
Hyah!

893
01:02:16.567 --> 01:02:19.698
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

894
01:02:21.143 --> 01:02:22.419
Kill me, teijano.

895
01:02:22.454 --> 01:02:23.627
You want to kill me, kill me!

896
01:02:23.667 --> 01:02:25.593
Or do you want to have me first?
...I don't want


897
01:02:25.731 --> 01:02:28.304
to kill you and I don't want to
hurt you... I want to know why.


898
01:02:28.343 --> 01:02:30.831
They know I'm from Carmargo.
They are riding to Los Cuevas.


899
01:02:30.871 --> 01:02:33.238
They say if I don't say
Amargosa, they kill mi familia.


900
01:02:33.271 --> 01:02:34.929
Tonight?
They ride tonight?


901
01:02:34.967 --> 01:02:37.040
I say Amargosa for
mi padre, mi madre...


902
01:02:37.079 --> 01:02:38.153
...Where are they?

903
01:02:38.187 --> 01:02:39.335
They're riding for Mexico

904
01:02:39.479 --> 01:02:40.908
crossing at Los Cuevas.

905
01:02:40.951 --> 01:02:42.060
Tell George to get word

906
01:02:42.095 --> 01:02:43.244
to the company.

907
01:02:43.287 --> 01:02:44.364
We're taking to the trail.

908
01:02:44.403 --> 01:02:45.468
Who taking the trail??

909
01:02:45.507 --> 01:02:46.581
You and I... Mexico.

910
01:02:57.622 --> 01:02:58.866
Richard!

911
01:03:00.311 --> 01:03:02.515
Richard!

912
01:03:15.191 --> 01:03:16.849
Where's Richard?

913
01:03:45.111 --> 01:03:46.769
Rangers!

914
01:03:50.327 --> 01:03:51.472
Drive the herd!

915
01:03:58.039 --> 01:03:59.949
These are Mexican beeves now!

916
01:03:59.991 --> 01:04:01.071
And the man is

917
01:04:01.111 --> 01:04:03.794
a Mexican man.

918
01:04:38.519 --> 01:04:40.592
Captain Leander McNelly.

919
01:04:41.591 --> 01:04:43.347
I've been waiting for you.

920
01:04:43.383 --> 01:04:45.139
The young soldier there

921
01:04:45.175 --> 01:04:46.997
has been talking my
ear off since dawn


922
01:04:47.031 --> 01:04:49.965
trying to work himself a trade.

923
01:04:50.007 --> 01:04:51.829
One Mexican juggler

924
01:04:51.862 --> 01:04:53.455
for one Texas clown.

925
01:04:53.495 --> 01:04:56.145
You send Captain Dukes
across that river


926
01:04:56.183 --> 01:04:58.452
we'll send your girl.

927
01:04:58.486 --> 01:04:59.861
You have my word.

928
01:04:59.894 --> 01:05:01.520
I could use a man
like you, Captain...


929
01:05:01.559 --> 01:05:05.137
a man who can shoot,
a man of his word.


930
01:05:05.175 --> 01:05:08.590
Man could live like a king
in Mexico.


931
01:05:08.631 --> 01:05:10.541
If I was your wife and boys

932
01:05:10.583 --> 01:05:13.201
Mexico's where I would have
hightailed it by now


933
01:05:13.238 --> 01:05:16.402
instead of waiting
for a killer like you.


934
01:05:16.439 --> 01:05:19.373
Maybe they're here now,
McNelly...


935
01:05:19.415 --> 01:05:22.415
living like kings in Mexico.

936
01:05:22.455 --> 01:05:25.270
Captain Dukes for the girl.

937
01:05:25.303 --> 01:05:28.020
He means nothing to you.

938
01:05:28.055 --> 01:05:29.713
But he means something
to you.


939
01:05:36.407 --> 01:05:38.414
Richard!

940
01:05:38.454 --> 01:05:40.429
Now we send her!

941
01:05:40.470 --> 01:05:42.859
No!
...Stand down, Mr. Dunnison.


942
01:05:42.902 --> 01:05:45.074
What she did was
to save her family.


943
01:05:45.111 --> 01:05:46.672
She's a victim, not an outlaw.

944
01:05:46.711 --> 01:05:48.849
Stand down...

945
01:05:48.887 --> 01:05:50.709
or be shot.

946
01:05:50.743 --> 01:05:52.979
This is not what Rangers do.

947
01:05:53.015 --> 01:05:54.924
Captain, show them

948
01:05:54.967 --> 01:05:57.782
the difference between them
and us.


949
01:06:02.198 --> 01:06:04.686
Stand down, Dunnison.

950
01:06:26.263 --> 01:06:28.946
The state of Texas commands you

951
01:06:28.982 --> 01:06:32.016
to leave its lands
now and forever.


952
01:06:32.054 --> 01:06:35.088
You will be prosecuted
and imprisoned


953
01:06:35.127 --> 01:06:37.298
should you ever return.

954
01:06:43.990 --> 01:06:47.187
May God have mercy on your sonl.

955
01:07:14.550 --> 01:07:16.525
I did what you say!

956
01:07:16.567 --> 01:07:18.989
Yeah, and you'll do what I say
tonight, and you'll do


957
01:07:19.031 --> 01:07:20.209
what I say tomorrow.

958
01:07:20.247 --> 01:07:22.287
Maybe one day
we'll charge admission.


959
01:07:42.519 --> 01:07:45.137
Don't know which
I want to do worse:


960
01:07:45.174 --> 01:07:48.142
kill the son of
a bitch up there...


961
01:07:48.183 --> 01:07:51.478
or go teach him how to play.

962
01:07:51.511 --> 01:07:54.194
McNELLY:
Take up your pen, Mr. Dunnison.


963
01:07:55.990 --> 01:07:57.070
No notebook, sir?

964
01:07:57.111 --> 01:07:58.867
Take up your pen.

965
01:08:01.750 --> 01:08:05.099
November 19.

966
01:08:05.142 --> 01:08:08.852
I, Leander McNelly,
being of sound mind


967
01:08:08.887 --> 01:08:11.276
do hereby bequeath
my land and property


968
01:08:11.319 --> 01:08:15.280
to the Texas Rangers

969
01:08:15.319 --> 01:08:17.458
to do as they see fit.

970
01:08:17.495 --> 01:08:19.862
The following items excepted:

971
01:08:19.894 --> 01:08:22.350
my Navy Colts, field glasses

972
01:08:22.391 --> 01:08:27.093
and books
on military strategy...


973
01:08:27.127 --> 01:08:28.850
to Lincoln Rogers Dunnison...

974
01:08:31.127 --> 01:08:34.902
a soldier fit to lead.

975
01:08:34.934 --> 01:08:38.895
My Bible I would like
to be buried with.


976
01:08:38.934 --> 01:08:40.756
That is all.

977
01:08:47.703 --> 01:08:49.044
Sir...

978
01:08:49.079 --> 01:08:52.308
In that fort will be
far more than 30 men.


979
01:08:52.343 --> 01:08:54.546
They'll never expect us
to cross


980
01:08:54.583 --> 01:08:56.143
into Mexico.

981
01:08:56.183 --> 01:08:59.249
They'll be well-armed
and well-provisioned.


982
01:08:59.287 --> 01:09:00.847
They've been riding
for weeks, sir.


983
01:09:00.887 --> 01:09:02.196
It's their first night back.

984
01:09:02.230 --> 01:09:04.751
The women, the liquor...
they'll crave sleep.


985
01:09:20.918 --> 01:09:23.569
Bones, start your men
at the front gates.


986
01:09:35.190 --> 01:09:36.190
Baker.

987
01:09:36.215 --> 01:09:37.425
Yes, sir.

988
01:09:37.463 --> 01:09:38.892
Take you men high to the ridge.

989
01:09:38.935 --> 01:09:39.935
Come on.

990
01:10:11.446 --> 01:10:15.090
Armstrong, Durham, take your men
low to the back gates.


991
01:10:15.127 --> 01:10:16.654
Dunnison and I

992
01:10:16.694 --> 01:10:17.938
will take the front.

993
01:10:17.974 --> 01:10:19.665
Now let's wake them np.

994
01:10:30.327 --> 01:10:33.294
Caballeros, the tunnels!
Come on!


995
01:10:33.334 --> 01:10:34.861
Let's get in the tunnels!
Move!


996
01:10:37.782 --> 01:10:40.816
Rangers!

997
01:11:02.871 --> 01:11:04.758
Vamonos, apurate!

998
01:11:08.662 --> 01:11:10.091
Charge!

999
01:11:14.070 --> 01:11:15.958
We're in, Rangers!

1000
01:11:15.990 --> 01:11:17.168
Oh, shit!

1001
01:11:18.518 --> 01:11:19.518
We're surronnded!

1002
01:11:19.543 --> 01:11:21.747
What the hell??!

1003
01:11:28.183 --> 01:11:29.776
We're surronnded in the back!

1004
01:12:38.934 --> 01:12:40.308
I'm out of cartridges!

1005
01:12:40.342 --> 01:12:42.197
Someone throw me a cartridge!

1006
01:12:58.071 --> 01:12:59.893
Vamos, rapido!

1007
01:13:02.070 --> 01:13:04.852
Heard you were fast.

1008
01:13:07.446 --> 01:13:09.519
Faster than that.

1009
01:13:25.238 --> 01:13:27.213
This is only gonna hurt

1010
01:13:27.254 --> 01:13:28.629
for a second.

1011
01:13:28.662 --> 01:13:30.801
Maybe two.

1012
01:13:34.358 --> 01:13:37.107
Kill him, Mr. Dunnison.

1013
01:13:37.142 --> 01:13:39.084
Kill him.

1014
01:13:39.126 --> 01:13:40.687
You kill me, I'll kill him.

1015
01:14:38.582 --> 01:14:41.037
Go!

1016
01:14:48.854 --> 01:14:50.829
Captain!

1017
01:14:50.870 --> 01:14:52.659
Captain, they want
to surrender.


1018
01:14:52.694 --> 01:14:54.003
They want to surrender.

1019
01:14:54.038 --> 01:14:55.631
No surrender, right, Captain?

1020
01:14:55.670 --> 01:14:57.394
No prisoners, right?

1021
01:14:57.430 --> 01:14:59.569
We take back our cattle.

1022
01:14:59.606 --> 01:15:01.940
We take them as prisoners.

1023
01:15:01.974 --> 01:15:03.916
We take them to trial.

1024
01:15:03.958 --> 01:15:04.973
But, Captain...

1025
01:15:05.014 --> 01:15:07.469
Those are the terms.

1026
01:15:41.814 --> 01:15:43.091
He wants to see you boys.

1027
01:16:12.182 --> 01:16:14.866
When they remember us,
Rangers...


1028
01:16:18.102 --> 01:16:22.096
let them remember us not
as men of vengeance...


1029
01:16:28.342 --> 01:16:31.920
but... as men of law...

1030
01:16:31.958 --> 01:16:35.602
and justice.

1031
01:17:17.590 --> 01:17:21.103
Can't help but think
that they're watching.


1032
01:17:21.142 --> 01:17:24.972
Yeah...
I bet they're up there


1033
01:17:25.014 --> 01:17:29.291
riding like the old days.

1034
01:17:31.574 --> 01:17:33.003
Hey, Caroline!

1035
01:17:34.262 --> 01:17:35.571
Rounding up cattle.

1036
01:17:35.606 --> 01:17:37.199
We'll see you tonight!

1037
01:17:37.238 --> 01:17:40.653
He'll make a good rancher.

1038
01:17:40.694 --> 01:17:42.516
And whatever else
you've got in mind


1039
01:17:42.550 --> 01:17:44.372
he might be all right
at that, too.


1040
01:17:46.838 --> 01:17:48.812
He's a good man, Mr. Dunnison.

1041
01:17:52.950 --> 01:17:55.317
Ride safe, Mr. Dunnison.

1042
01:18:01.974 --> 01:18:03.949
Rangers...

1043
01:18:07.798 --> 01:18:09.173
Ride out!
