But you know what's
missing, don't ya?


10
00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:39.691
Little bass solo.

11
00:03:39.735 --> 00:03:40.953
No, what?

12
00:03:40.997 --> 00:03:43.129
Okay, one
more chorus though.


13
00:03:43.173 --> 00:03:44.348
No.

14
00:03:44.391 --> 00:03:45.610
Heavy and quick,

Hey, Iz.

19
00:04:09.678 --> 00:04:12.724
I'm making the trip to town
tomorrow, you want anything?


20
00:04:12.768 --> 00:04:13.551
Can I come?

21
00:04:16.032 --> 00:04:21.037
Can I have some charcoal
pencils and drumsticks, please?


22
00:04:23.039 --> 00:04:24.344
Sure.

23
00:04:24.388 --> 00:04:26.738
Hey, that was a good
practice tonight.


24
00:04:26.782 --> 00:04:27.565
Yeah.

25
00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:29.828

Local artist, she's fabulous.

41
00:07:51.421 --> 00:07:53.292
I remember you.

42
00:07:53.336 --> 00:07:54.598
I know you.

43
00:07:54.641 --> 00:07:57.035
You haven't changed a day.

44
00:07:57.079 --> 00:07:59.429
You were my grandmother's nurse.

45
00:07:59.472 --> 00:08:01.736
I'm sorry, I think
you're mistaken.


46
00:08:01.779 --> 00:08:04.216
That'll be $75.

47
00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:05.043
Thanks.

48
00:08:05.087 --> 00:08:05.870
Thank you.

49
00:08:05.914 --> 00:08:07.219
You have a great day.

50
00:08:07.263 --> 00:08:08.003
Bye!

51
00:08:32.679 --> 00:08:33.768
Hey, Mom.

52
00:08:33.811 --> 00:08:34.812
Hey, kiddo.

53
00:08:34.856 --> 00:08:35.900
How was town?

54
00:08:35.944 --> 00:08:37.597
Same old, same old.

55
00:08:37.641 --> 00:08:39.295
Got some fun shit though.

56
00:08:40.687 --> 00:08:42.254
Check this out.

57
00:08:42.298 --> 00:08:43.255
Oh!

58
00:08:43.299 --> 00:08:44.909
New look for the band maybe?

59
00:08:44.953 --> 00:08:45.954
I love it, man.

60
00:08:45.997 --> 00:08:47.129
That is sick!

61
00:08:48.130 --> 00:08:49.131
It's so cool.

62
00:08:50.045 --> 00:08:50.959
What else?

63
00:08:52.003 --> 00:08:53.396
I went to the record shop.

64
00:08:54.353 --> 00:08:55.137
Thought these looked cool.

65
00:08:55.180 --> 00:08:56.703
That's awesome.

66
00:08:56.747 --> 00:08:59.271
I can't wait to
look through them.


67
00:09:02.187 --> 00:09:04.102
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.


68
00:09:04.146 --> 00:09:05.495
I like making you happy.

69
00:09:06.670 --> 00:09:07.932
How about you?

70
00:09:07.976 --> 00:09:08.803
How was your day?

71
00:09:09.978 --> 00:09:11.501
It was good.

72
00:09:11.544 --> 00:09:14.504
I went hunting.

73
00:09:15.505 --> 00:09:16.245
For what?

74
00:09:17.159 --> 00:09:17.986
A laugh.

75
00:09:20.162 --> 00:09:21.554
But

76
00:09:21.598 --> 00:09:23.121
it was a ghost.

77
00:10:48.250 --> 00:10:50.078
Great food in
the in the forest today.


78
00:10:50.121 --> 00:10:51.557
It looks good.

79
00:10:51.601 --> 00:10:53.733
Spring eats
winter, winter eats fall.


80
00:10:53.777 --> 00:10:56.214
Fall eats summer,
summer eats spring.


81
00:13:08.912 --> 00:13:10.087
Oh!

82
00:13:10.131 --> 00:13:11.697
Hi!

83
00:13:11.741 --> 00:13:12.568
Oh my God.

84
00:13:13.395 --> 00:13:15.353
Sorry, sorry to bother you.

85
00:13:15.397 --> 00:13:18.748
Woo, I am so lost!

86
00:13:18.791 --> 00:13:20.924
You're, you're trespassing.

87
00:13:20.967 --> 00:13:22.056
Understood.

88
00:13:23.231 --> 00:13:25.189
Oh my God, I've been
hiking for hours.


89
00:13:25.233 --> 00:13:29.063
I, I parked on 209,

90
00:13:29.106 --> 00:13:31.456
and now I just can't
find my way back.


91
00:13:31.500 --> 00:13:34.198
Do you know where 209 is?

92
00:13:34.242 --> 00:13:36.070
Is this your property?

93
00:13:36.113 --> 00:13:38.463
Yeah, I live here with my mom.

94
00:13:38.507 --> 00:13:40.596
You're a country
girl, like my niece.


95
00:13:40.639 --> 00:13:41.553
Amber Hanson?

96
00:13:41.597 --> 00:13:42.946
She goes to school in town.

97
00:13:44.252 --> 00:13:45.601
I'm homeschool.

98
00:13:45.644 --> 00:13:46.863
Oh.

99
00:13:46.906 --> 00:13:50.301
Anyway, she lives like
one mountain over,


100
00:13:51.694 --> 00:13:53.435
or one mountain over.

101
00:13:53.478 --> 00:13:57.395
She lives a mountain
over.


102
00:13:57.439 --> 00:13:58.831
I gotta show you something.

103
00:13:58.875 --> 00:13:59.702
Look at this.

104
00:14:00.659 --> 00:14:02.096
Those don't work out here.

105
00:14:02.139 --> 00:14:04.663
If they did work, I
wouldn't be so lost.


106
00:14:04.707 --> 00:14:09.625
I took a picture of something
that was just super odd.


107
00:14:10.800 --> 00:14:11.670
Have you ever seen
anything like this?


108
00:14:12.715 --> 00:14:13.585
I'm sick.

109
00:14:13.629 --> 00:14:15.761
Oh, you don't look sick.

110
00:14:15.805 --> 00:14:17.633
- I am.
- Well, look at this.


111
00:14:19.156 --> 00:14:20.766
Hey!

112
00:14:31.647 --> 00:14:32.865
Pleased to meet you.

113
00:14:44.660 --> 00:14:49.665
Oh, fucking god!

114
00:14:55.323 --> 00:14:56.411
How the fuck?

115
00:15:02.243 --> 00:15:05.637
So, is that your
daughter that I met?


116
00:15:10.381 --> 00:15:11.513
What's wrong with her?

117
00:15:15.517 --> 00:15:16.735
Do you know the Hansons?

118
00:15:16.779 --> 00:15:19.085
I was telling your
daughter that my niece


119
00:15:19.129 --> 00:15:21.000
lives fairly close.

120
00:15:21.044 --> 00:15:25.179
I was thinking that maybe
I could introduce them.


121
00:15:25.222 --> 00:15:26.354
I think they'd really

122
00:15:27.529 --> 00:15:28.356
get along.

123
00:15:29.400 --> 00:15:30.488
Are you married?

124
00:15:31.576 --> 00:15:32.882
No.

125
00:15:32.925 --> 00:15:36.190
Do you have any children?

126
00:15:36.233 --> 00:15:37.408
No.

127
00:15:37.452 --> 00:15:39.541
I would have liked
to have kids though.


128
00:15:43.371 --> 00:15:44.241
Okay.

129
00:17:00.535 --> 00:17:03.451
I didn't get too
close to him, I promise.


130
00:17:04.365 --> 00:17:05.191
Okay.

131
00:17:07.063 --> 00:17:08.456
You think I'm gonna be okay?

132
00:17:11.981 --> 00:17:13.591
You'll be fine.

133
00:20:19.647 --> 00:20:20.778
Hey!

134
00:20:20.822 --> 00:20:23.520
I see you, you big perve!

135
00:20:23.564 --> 00:20:24.390
AJ!

136
00:20:27.350 --> 00:20:28.656
I'm gonna fuck you up!

137
00:20:31.006 --> 00:20:32.486
Oh!

138
00:20:32.529 --> 00:20:33.356
You're not AJ.

139
00:20:35.010 --> 00:20:35.837
Sorry.

140
00:20:37.360 --> 00:20:38.100
I'm Izzy.

141
00:20:40.406 --> 00:20:41.799
Amber.

142
00:20:41.843 --> 00:20:43.409
I'm your neighbor.

143
00:20:43.453 --> 00:20:45.629
I live up on that mountain.

144
00:20:45.673 --> 00:20:46.500
Which mountain?

145
00:20:49.198 --> 00:20:50.025
That mountain.

146
00:20:51.592 --> 00:20:52.680
Well, that's news to me.

147
00:20:52.723 --> 00:20:54.029
You want a beer, neighbor?

148
00:21:00.383 --> 00:21:02.341
Well, are you gonna be creepy
or are you gonna come over?


149
00:21:26.583 --> 00:21:28.411
Are you gonna sit the
fuck down or what?


150
00:21:31.936 --> 00:21:32.937
I'm sick.

151
00:21:32.981 --> 00:21:34.243
What do you got, an STD?

152
00:21:36.071 --> 00:21:37.289
I'm just fuckin' with ya.

153
00:21:38.726 --> 00:21:39.683
Sit.

154
00:21:39.727 --> 00:21:42.686
I can't get close to people.

155
00:21:42.730 --> 00:21:43.513
None of us can.

156
00:21:46.516 --> 00:21:48.039
I'll sit.

157
00:22:05.970 --> 00:22:07.798
How come I've never
seen you before?


158
00:22:07.842 --> 00:22:09.583
I'm homeschooled.

159
00:22:09.626 --> 00:22:11.280
Well, what do you do for fun?

160
00:22:12.629 --> 00:22:14.457
I hike.

161
00:22:16.111 --> 00:22:17.591
I draw.

162
00:22:17.634 --> 00:22:19.854
And swim, I swim.

163
00:22:22.204 --> 00:22:23.509
I'm in a band.

164
00:22:23.553 --> 00:22:25.642
Well, that's cool,
what do you play?


165
00:22:25.686 --> 00:22:26.904
The drums.

166
00:22:26.948 --> 00:22:28.340
Oh, cool, I used
to date a drummer.


167
00:22:28.384 --> 00:22:31.082
They're hot, but dumb.

168
00:22:31.126 --> 00:22:32.736
I sing, too.

169
00:22:32.780 --> 00:22:33.650
Nice.

170
00:22:33.694 --> 00:22:36.435
And I write the lyrics also.

171
00:22:36.479 --> 00:22:38.437
Damn, girl, what's
your band's name?


172
00:22:38.481 --> 00:22:39.264
Hellbender.

173
00:22:39.308 --> 00:22:41.615
Wicked.

174
00:22:41.658 --> 00:22:42.964
You should come play at
a part of mine sometime.


175
00:22:43.007 --> 00:22:44.748
That'd be so cool!

176
00:22:56.151 --> 00:22:57.108
Drink up.

177
00:22:57.152 --> 00:22:58.501
But don't piss in the pool.

178
00:24:43.954 --> 00:24:45.129
Liar!

179
00:24:55.618 --> 00:24:56.358
Mom.

180
00:24:57.707 --> 00:24:59.100
What's happening?

181
00:25:16.813 --> 00:25:18.815
♪ Hell yeah ♪

182
00:25:18.859 --> 00:25:21.905

197
00:26:19.528 --> 00:26:22.357
I better get home, I got
a babysitting gig tonight.


198
00:26:22.400 --> 00:26:23.314
What?

199
00:26:23.358 --> 00:26:24.838
This isn't your home?

200
00:26:24.881 --> 00:26:26.752
You thought
I lived here?


201
00:26:26.796 --> 00:26:27.971
No fuckin' way.

202
00:26:28.015 --> 00:26:29.538
I just sneak in
to use their pool.


203
00:26:29.581 --> 00:26:31.496
Somebody's got to use it.

204
00:26:31.540 --> 00:26:33.368
They're city-ots,
they'll never know.


205
00:26:34.195 --> 00:26:36.153
Well, where do you live?

206
00:26:36.197 --> 00:26:37.589
About a mile down the road.

207
00:26:37.633 --> 00:26:38.764
It's not as nice.

208
00:26:49.036 --> 00:26:51.908
I've got some friends coming
tomorrow, you should come.


209
00:26:51.952 --> 00:26:53.083
Okay.

210
00:26:53.127 --> 00:26:55.172
Bring a bathing
suit this time.


211
00:26:55.216 --> 00:26:57.566
I don't have a bathing suit.

212
00:26:58.915 --> 00:27:00.482
I'll bring you one.

213
00:27:00.525 --> 00:27:02.440
You look like a cross between
Kurt Cobain and a wet dog.


214
00:27:02.484 --> 00:27:04.399
Okay.

215
00:27:04.442 --> 00:27:07.271
See you tomorrow, Hellbender!

216
00:27:07.315 --> 00:27:08.882
See ya, Amber.

217
00:27:29.076 --> 00:27:30.904
I want to play out.

218
00:27:30.947 --> 00:27:31.817
What?

219
00:27:31.861 --> 00:27:33.689
I want to play out, for people.

220
00:27:35.604 --> 00:27:37.388
That's not gonna happen.

221
00:27:37.432 --> 00:27:38.694
Why not?

222
00:27:38.737 --> 00:27:41.392
I mean, we do all this
and we're really good.


223
00:27:41.436 --> 00:27:42.916
I think that we
should show people.


224
00:27:42.959 --> 00:27:45.483
Well, you know, we do it for us.

225
00:27:45.527 --> 00:27:47.050
It's our thing.

226
00:27:47.094 --> 00:27:49.096
'Cause it's fun.

227
00:27:49.139 --> 00:27:53.752
I love playing with you,
but I think it'd be fun


228
00:27:53.796 --> 00:27:58.714
to share our fucking amazing
songs with other people.


229
00:27:59.976 --> 00:28:01.064
I think people would
really like them.


230
00:28:01.108 --> 00:28:02.413
If a band plays in the woods

231
00:28:02.457 --> 00:28:03.806
and there's no one
there to hear it,


232
00:28:03.849 --> 00:28:05.329
did the band really play?

233
00:28:07.636 --> 00:28:09.768
Izzy, what's going on?

234
00:28:09.812 --> 00:28:11.118
Nothing, I'm just.

235
00:28:12.206 --> 00:28:13.337
What if I'm better?

236
00:28:13.381 --> 00:28:14.643
You're not.

237
00:28:14.686 --> 00:28:16.775
You took me away from
people when I was five.


238
00:28:16.819 --> 00:28:18.081
How do you know?

239
00:28:18.125 --> 00:28:20.866
I know that I don't want
to take any chances.


240
00:28:20.910 --> 00:28:23.086
I love you too much.

241
00:28:23.130 --> 00:28:24.392
I love you, too.

242
00:28:24.435 --> 00:28:28.613
But I also love the idea
of meeting other people


243
00:28:28.657 --> 00:28:31.616
who might like music as
much as me, or something.


244
00:28:31.660 --> 00:28:32.878
You know?

245
00:28:32.922 --> 00:28:34.663
Maybe I could just
have one friend.


246
00:28:34.706 --> 00:28:35.969
All I need is one.

247
00:28:37.187 --> 00:28:39.146
Izzy, you can't be
around anyone, ever.


248
00:28:41.713 --> 00:28:43.498
Let's just practice.

249
00:28:45.065 --> 00:28:46.066
Armageddon?

250
00:28:47.154 --> 00:28:47.981
Okay.

251
00:28:49.852 --> 00:28:52.289

All right, Hellbender.

265
00:30:26.775 --> 00:30:28.124
I got you something
on the chair.


266

Hot Mama!

267
00:30:37.264 --> 00:30:38.395
Hi, I'm AJ.

268
00:30:38.439 --> 00:30:39.918
Hey, I'm Ingrid.

269
00:30:39.962 --> 00:30:41.398
AJ's going to med
school in the fall.


270
00:30:41.442 --> 00:30:43.574
You should tell
him about your STD.


271
00:30:43.618 --> 00:30:44.836
I don't have an STD.

272
00:30:44.880 --> 00:30:46.403
I have an immune disease.

273
00:30:46.447 --> 00:30:47.926
Oh, which one?

274
00:30:47.970 --> 00:30:51.582
X-linked severe combined
immunodeficiency disease.


275
00:30:51.626 --> 00:30:52.670
That's weird.

276
00:30:52.714 --> 00:30:54.324
I thought only boys got that,

277
00:30:54.368 --> 00:30:56.848
and it's super fatal
passed infancy.


278
00:30:56.892 --> 00:30:59.024
Well, if that's true you
can thank your mom for it.


279
00:30:59.068 --> 00:31:00.156
That's what the X means.

280
00:31:08.382 --> 00:31:10.166
Oh my god, you suck.

281

290
00:31:49.379 --> 00:31:50.206
Tequila?

291
00:31:55.429 --> 00:31:59.476
In celebration of our new friend
and her first tequila shot,


292
00:31:59.520 --> 00:32:02.827
I will place in one of these
cups not the typical dead worm


293
00:32:02.871 --> 00:32:04.612
you'd find at the
bottom of a bottle,


294
00:32:05.874 --> 00:32:10.444
but a real, live, bloody
bodacious earthworm.


295
00:32:33.249 --> 00:32:33.989
Drink up.

296
00:32:37.384 --> 00:32:39.124
I'm vegetarian.

297
00:32:39.168 --> 00:32:40.517
You were vegetarian.

298
00:32:40.561 --> 00:32:42.040
Now, you're a worm-atarian.

299
00:32:42.084 --> 00:32:43.955
Oh, come on guys,
leave her alone.


300
00:32:43.999 --> 00:32:44.869
I'll have the worm.

301
00:32:44.913 --> 00:32:46.219
No, them's the rules.

302
00:32:46.262 --> 00:32:48.438
You get the worm,
you eat the worm.


303
00:32:48.482 --> 00:32:49.613
Come on, kid.

304
00:32:49.657 --> 00:32:51.224
It'll give you
superhuman strength.


305
00:32:51.267 --> 00:32:53.313
Hold your nose, you
won't even taste it.


306
00:33:48.455 --> 00:33:49.673
Hey!

307
00:34:11.913 --> 00:34:13.131
Oh my God.

308
00:34:13.175 --> 00:34:18.180
They never come up
on weekdays!


309
00:34:19.050 --> 00:34:20.313
Dude, you forgot your clothes.

310
00:34:21.531 --> 00:34:24.317
And your fucking shoes.

311
00:34:24.360 --> 00:34:25.448
You wild woman!

312
00:34:27.363 --> 00:34:28.799
I'm gonna need that bikini back.

313
00:34:28.843 --> 00:34:32.412
Oh my God, you're
so fucking screwed.


314
00:34:43.031 --> 00:34:45.033
Dude, I'm not gay.

315
00:34:45.076 --> 00:34:46.687
But I got friends
you could meet.


316
00:35:01.876 --> 00:35:03.443
What the fuck, dude?

317
00:35:07.229 --> 00:35:09.405
Don't you ever fucking
come near me again!


318
00:35:59.150 --> 00:36:01.326
Hey, you're fucked!

319
00:36:01.370 --> 00:36:03.067
I'm sick of you kids
trashing my pool


320
00:36:03.111 --> 00:36:04.808
and breaking into my pool house!

321
00:36:04.852 --> 00:36:06.767
That is a vintage drum set!

322
00:36:07.942 --> 00:36:09.596
Look at me when I'm
fucking talking to you!


323
00:36:11.206 --> 00:36:12.903
Are you stoned?

324
00:36:12.947 --> 00:36:15.079
Are you fucking high?

325
00:36:15.123 --> 00:36:15.950
Hello?

326
00:36:17.691 --> 00:36:19.127
Fucking pathetic.

327
00:36:20.128 --> 00:36:21.564
You're an idiot.

328
00:36:21.608 --> 00:36:23.000
You're coming with me
and I'm calling the cops.


329
00:36:51.638 --> 00:36:53.422
Where have you been?

330
00:36:54.641 --> 00:36:56.817
I was with some friends.

331
00:37:09.525 --> 00:37:10.657
I ate a worm.

332
00:37:13.834 --> 00:37:14.835
A live worm.

333
00:37:16.750 --> 00:37:18.099
Are your friends okay?

334
00:37:20.841 --> 00:37:22.277
They'll be fine.

335
00:37:27.848 --> 00:37:28.936
I'm not sick.

336
00:37:31.591 --> 00:37:33.201
You're dangerous.

337
00:37:38.859 --> 00:37:41.514
My friend Amber's uncle's
been missing for two days.


338
00:37:50.958 --> 00:37:51.741
Izzy.

339
00:37:55.049 --> 00:37:56.224
It's gonna be okay.

340
00:37:58.052 --> 00:37:58.966
I'm gonna help you.

341
00:38:02.796 --> 00:38:04.711
Can we talk about
what happened today?


342
00:40:50.877 --> 00:40:52.400
Hey!

343
00:40:52.443 --> 00:40:54.097
You're not gonna
eat that, are you?


344
00:40:55.142 --> 00:40:56.404
No.

345
00:40:56.447 --> 00:40:58.711
'Cause the hairs kind of
get stuck in your teeth.


346
00:41:01.104 --> 00:41:04.020
Why did that
worm make me so crazy?


347
00:41:04.064 --> 00:41:05.456
It wasn't the worm.

348
00:41:05.500 --> 00:41:07.371
It was the life in the worm.

349
00:41:07.415 --> 00:41:11.027
Magic comes from the
fear, the fear of death.


350
00:41:11.071 --> 00:41:12.855
Every living thing has it.

351
00:41:12.899 --> 00:41:16.250
The more fear pumping through
the blood, the more power.


352
00:41:17.686 --> 00:41:19.427
You think the worm
gives you power?


353
00:41:20.907 --> 00:41:22.604
Try a rat.

354
00:41:22.647 --> 00:41:24.737
Or a dog, woo!

355
00:41:24.780 --> 00:41:25.520
Or a deer.

356
00:41:28.349 --> 00:41:29.785
It's all in the pumping blood.

357
00:41:35.095 --> 00:41:37.750
What happens if we eat...

358
00:41:40.622 --> 00:41:41.318
What?

359
00:41:42.624 --> 00:41:43.451
People.

360
00:41:45.845 --> 00:41:48.108
Then you'll know power.

361
00:41:48.151 --> 00:41:49.109
Is this a dream?

362
00:42:42.684 --> 00:42:44.120
Wow.

363
00:42:44.164 --> 00:42:46.514
I have never seen you like
raspberry thorn so much.


364
00:42:47.689 --> 00:42:48.864
Your tastes are maturing.

365
00:42:51.084 --> 00:42:52.607
I shouldn't have said anything.

366
00:42:54.348 --> 00:42:56.045
Will you take a
rainy hike with me?


367
00:42:57.568 --> 00:42:58.352
Sure.

368
00:43:10.886 --> 00:43:12.714
I shouldn't have
kept this from you.


369
00:43:13.933 --> 00:43:15.108
It was a mistake.

370
00:43:16.370 --> 00:43:17.371
It's all right.

371
00:43:19.025 --> 00:43:19.852
Why did you?

372
00:43:22.550 --> 00:43:23.856
Keep you safe.

373
00:43:23.899 --> 00:43:24.639
From what?

374
00:43:26.380 --> 00:43:28.208
You've opened a door that

375
00:43:30.036 --> 00:43:33.430
once it's open, it
can be hard to shut.


376
00:43:33.474 --> 00:43:36.694
But you only opened
it a little, right?


377
00:43:36.738 --> 00:43:38.348
So, that's good.

378
00:43:38.392 --> 00:43:39.132
In fact, it's.

379
00:43:40.829 --> 00:43:41.612
It's great.

380
00:43:43.397 --> 00:43:45.529
It was bound to be open
and I wish I was there.


381
00:43:45.573 --> 00:43:47.357
I should've been there.

382
00:43:47.401 --> 00:43:49.011
You're good, Izzy.

383
00:43:49.055 --> 00:43:50.360
You're good.

384
00:43:50.404 --> 00:43:52.841
I can help you keep
it all in control.


385
00:44:06.986 --> 00:44:07.900
So, we're the same?

386
00:44:10.250 --> 00:44:11.077
Yeah.

387
00:44:12.687 --> 00:44:14.080
Was your mom like us?

388
00:44:16.778 --> 00:44:17.605
Well.

389
00:44:18.823 --> 00:44:20.913
She was, but she
wasn't a good mother.


390
00:44:20.956 --> 00:44:25.091
And in the end, she might've
wished she had been.


391
00:44:30.618 --> 00:44:32.315
So, can we leave
the mountain now?


392
00:44:33.273 --> 00:44:34.100
No.

393
00:44:35.492 --> 00:44:36.711
Why, I'm not sick.

394
00:44:37.973 --> 00:44:40.584
Look, I'm gonna
show you something,


395
00:44:40.628 --> 00:44:42.804
but you gotta promise
no more door slammin'.


396
00:44:43.805 --> 00:44:44.632
Okay?

397
00:44:51.726 --> 00:44:54.250
Eat it quick while
it's still alive.


398
00:46:04.538 --> 00:46:06.366
All right, show me
what you got, kid.


399
00:46:37.092 --> 00:46:38.572
Holy shit.

400
00:46:40.922 --> 00:46:43.533
And that's why you can't
leave the mountain.


401
00:47:07.122 --> 00:47:11.953

411
00:49:37.794 --> 00:49:39.056
Hey.

412
00:49:39.100 --> 00:49:40.057
Hey.

413
00:49:40.101 --> 00:49:41.755
What are you doing down there?

414
00:49:43.931 --> 00:49:45.933
I was just putting
back some paint.


415
00:51:03.010 --> 00:51:04.620
I can hear you hearing me!

416
00:51:04.664 --> 00:51:06.187
Hey.

417
00:51:06.230 --> 00:51:07.014
Can I come in?

418
00:51:08.058 --> 00:51:09.146
Sure.

419
00:51:14.891 --> 00:51:18.678
You remember the friend you,
uh, you made last summer?


420
00:51:20.027 --> 00:51:20.810
Amber?

421
00:51:20.854 --> 00:51:21.681
Yeah.

422
00:51:23.596 --> 00:51:24.510
You still friends?

423
00:51:28.688 --> 00:51:29.863
Do you ever see her?

424
00:51:32.039 --> 00:51:32.779
No.

425
00:51:37.044 --> 00:51:39.176
Is that because I'd
forbidden you to


426
00:51:39.220 --> 00:51:41.527
or did something bad happen?

427
00:51:44.051 --> 00:51:45.618
The last time I saw her,

428
00:51:45.661 --> 00:51:50.057
she said that my friendship
was kind of suffocating her.


429
00:51:52.886 --> 00:51:54.061
That's not your fault.

430
00:51:56.063 --> 00:51:58.152
But remember, Iz,
we're not like them.


431
00:52:00.110 --> 00:52:01.547
We don't need them.

432
00:52:03.592 --> 00:52:05.899
We can be perfectly
happy here, together.


433
00:52:08.249 --> 00:52:08.989
Alone.

434
00:52:11.339 --> 00:52:14.081
How come I'm the only one
who's completely alone then?


435
00:52:15.430 --> 00:52:18.520
Well, we can work on that.

436
00:52:18.564 --> 00:52:19.869
When...

437
00:52:19.913 --> 00:52:21.523
When I'm not dangerous?

438
00:52:21.567 --> 00:52:22.350
Yeah.

439
00:52:24.439 --> 00:52:25.484
Dangerous to who?

440
00:52:28.138 --> 00:52:28.922
Whom?

441
00:52:38.932 --> 00:52:41.587
Hey, Iz, I'm going to
town, do you need anything?


442
00:52:41.630 --> 00:52:42.979
No, thank you.

443
00:52:43.023 --> 00:52:43.806
Have fun.

444
00:55:06.340 --> 00:55:07.907
Hey, let's go to the ravine.

445
00:55:09.256 --> 00:55:09.952
Okay.

446
00:55:11.432 --> 00:55:12.868
Mom.

447
00:55:12.912 --> 00:55:13.695
Mom.

448
00:55:13.739 --> 00:55:14.566
Oh.

449
00:55:17.917 --> 00:55:18.657
More bones.

450
00:55:25.185 --> 00:55:26.882
What do you think did this?

451
00:55:26.926 --> 00:55:28.884
I don't know.

452
00:55:28.928 --> 00:55:31.321
I've been seeing a
lot of bones lately.


453
00:55:31.365 --> 00:55:33.933
All stripped clean, like this.

454
00:55:33.976 --> 00:55:35.064
Impressive.

455
00:55:38.502 --> 00:55:39.460
Probably coyotes.

456
00:55:40.766 --> 00:55:41.549
Beautiful.

457
00:55:44.552 --> 00:55:45.292
But vicious.

458
00:55:45.335 --> 00:55:46.598
No, no, I.

459
00:55:46.641 --> 00:55:49.296
Whatever did this, it's
neither right or wrong.


460
00:55:49.339 --> 00:55:50.471
It's just their nature.

461
00:56:18.717 --> 00:56:20.501
What is our nature?

462
00:56:23.547 --> 00:56:24.548
Our nature is dark.

463
00:56:26.725 --> 00:56:28.422
But I can teach you to starve it

464
00:56:29.510 --> 00:56:31.164
so it doesn't consume you.

465
00:56:32.992 --> 00:56:35.951
But you said whatever
killed that deer back there,


466
00:56:35.995 --> 00:56:37.170
that was in their nature.

467
00:56:38.345 --> 00:56:40.216
You know why we're
called hellbenders?


468
00:56:41.827 --> 00:56:43.002
Because we're powerful.

469
00:56:43.872 --> 00:56:46.179
And anything powerful is feared.

470
00:56:48.007 --> 00:56:51.750
Our ancestors grew drunk on
that fear, they craved it.


471
00:56:53.273 --> 00:56:56.537
And so it was said we had
turned our backs on heaven


472
00:56:56.580 --> 00:56:58.234
and bent towards hell.

473
00:57:01.847 --> 00:57:03.457
Do you want that kind of legacy?

474
00:57:05.372 --> 00:57:06.547
To be soulless?

475
00:57:07.548 --> 00:57:08.375
Unloved?

476
00:57:10.029 --> 00:57:10.725
Feared?

477
00:57:15.034 --> 00:57:16.513
Pop quiz.

478
00:57:16.557 --> 00:57:20.866
What happens when you mix
huckleberries and tears?


479
00:57:24.217 --> 00:57:26.001
It enhances your eyesight.

480
00:57:26.045 --> 00:57:27.220
Okay, that's too easy.

481
00:57:28.395 --> 00:57:32.225
What if you crush
spiderwebs and ivy.


482
00:57:34.444 --> 00:57:35.707
It makes your palms sticky

483
00:57:35.750 --> 00:57:37.578
so you can climb
trees like squirrels.


484
00:57:38.579 --> 00:57:39.536
Awesome.

485
00:57:39.580 --> 00:57:40.320
It is.

486
00:57:41.756 --> 00:57:43.192
Where'd you learn this stuff?

487
00:57:43.236 --> 00:57:43.976
My mother.

488
00:57:46.065 --> 00:57:47.153
Anywhere else?

489
00:57:48.415 --> 00:57:49.242
No.

490
00:57:52.898 --> 00:57:54.551
Hey.

491
00:57:54.595 --> 00:57:57.250
What do you know about ferns?

492
00:57:57.293 --> 00:57:58.207
Nothing.

493
00:57:58.251 --> 00:57:59.774
Oh, such a beautiful plant.

494
00:57:59.818 --> 00:58:01.994
Self reproducing, like us.

495
00:58:03.343 --> 00:58:04.213
Awesome.

496
00:58:04.257 --> 00:58:05.127
It is.

497
00:58:05.171 --> 00:58:07.303
And if you've crush ferns

498
00:58:08.957 --> 00:58:13.614
and fungus with one other
very special element,


499
00:58:21.796 --> 00:58:23.319
you can smell blood on the wind.

500
00:58:24.451 --> 00:58:27.802
Blood on the wind, I like that.

501
00:58:27.846 --> 00:58:29.064
But I need you to understand

502
00:58:29.108 --> 00:58:31.893
we don't need this
kind of thing anymore.


503
00:58:31.937 --> 00:58:33.329
We're evolving.

504
00:58:34.461 --> 00:58:35.897
Okay.

505
00:58:35.941 --> 00:58:37.159
This is really fucking
cool, do you want to try it?


506
00:58:37.203 --> 00:58:38.291
- Yeah.
- Okay, good.


507
00:59:00.139 --> 00:59:01.662
What do you smell?

508
00:59:04.360 --> 00:59:05.144
A crow?

509
00:59:11.367 --> 00:59:12.151
A rabbit?

510
00:59:16.329 --> 00:59:18.157
I smell something big.

511
00:59:19.985 --> 00:59:20.812
Good.

512
00:59:20.855 --> 00:59:21.725
I smell a man.

513
00:59:21.769 --> 00:59:22.683
Hello!

514
00:59:23.989 --> 00:59:26.469
This is private property,
you're trespassing.


515
00:59:26.513 --> 00:59:30.386
Actually, state land runs
right along these rocks.


516
00:59:30.430 --> 00:59:31.997
That must be your property.

517
00:59:34.347 --> 00:59:35.827
Can I talk to you for a minute?

518
00:59:37.437 --> 00:59:39.004
How about 30 seconds?

519
00:59:39.047 --> 00:59:40.483
We're just leaving.

520
00:59:40.527 --> 00:59:42.181
10 seconds, I'm a fast talker.

521
00:59:47.534 --> 00:59:48.665
All right, since
we're short on time


522
00:59:48.709 --> 00:59:50.885
I'm gonna get
straight to the point.


523
00:59:50.929 --> 00:59:53.540
Young lady, I need you to
be totally honest with me.


524
00:59:55.020 --> 00:59:56.325
Where can I buy that shirt?

525
00:59:56.369 --> 00:59:57.849
There's only one.

526
00:59:57.892 --> 00:59:59.851
I made it for our band.

527
00:59:59.894 --> 01:00:01.156
10 seconds.

528
01:00:01.200 --> 01:00:03.419
All right, business.

529
01:00:03.463 --> 01:00:05.987
I'm sure you all heard a
man was killed last summer


530
01:00:06.031 --> 01:00:08.990
by a wild animal or wild animals

531
01:00:09.034 --> 01:00:10.905
couple of miles from here.

532
01:00:10.949 --> 01:00:13.516
It's my belief it's a
rabid mountain lion.


533
01:00:13.560 --> 01:00:15.170
Have you guys noticed
any carcasses?


534
01:00:15.214 --> 01:00:16.432
No.

535
01:00:16.476 --> 01:00:17.346
This might have something to do

536
01:00:17.390 --> 01:00:19.218
with the disappearance of a man.

537
01:00:19.261 --> 01:00:23.178
We found his car on 209,
but no sign of his body.


538
01:00:23.222 --> 01:00:24.701
You see many hikers around here?

539
01:00:24.745 --> 01:00:26.007
Nope.

540
01:00:26.051 --> 01:00:27.530
Well, maybe it's a hellbender.

541
01:00:27.574 --> 01:00:29.184
What's a hellbender?

542
01:00:29.228 --> 01:00:30.707
It's kind of a cross
between a witch,


543
01:00:30.751 --> 01:00:33.406
a demon, and an apex predator.

544
01:00:33.449 --> 01:00:35.887
They live off the fear that
pumps through human blood,


545
01:00:35.930 --> 01:00:37.889
which gives them
exceptional power.


546
01:00:39.194 --> 01:00:40.369
They've been around
since the dawn of time,


547
01:00:40.413 --> 01:00:42.023
and they're still evolving.

548
01:00:42.067 --> 01:00:45.374
Young lady, if you
don't become a designer,


549
01:00:45.418 --> 01:00:46.898
you should become a writer.

550
01:00:46.941 --> 01:00:48.769
All right, deal?

551
01:00:49.770 --> 01:00:50.902
All right, ladies.

552
01:00:50.945 --> 01:00:52.077
Take care of
yourselves out there.


553
01:00:52.120 --> 01:00:53.469
Have a good one.

554
01:02:31.959 --> 01:02:32.742
A worm?

555
01:02:34.048 --> 01:02:36.964
You want to go back
to moss and twigs?


556
01:02:38.705 --> 01:02:40.185
I mean, it's baby food.

557
01:02:43.057 --> 01:02:44.885
Why don't we eat a frog?

558
01:02:46.582 --> 01:02:47.583
Or a hedgehog?

559
01:02:49.194 --> 01:02:52.719
Or we can just go out
for burgers.


560
01:02:58.899 --> 01:02:59.639

572
01:04:25.986 --> 01:04:28.423
Hey, Izzy, I know you're pissed.

573
01:04:28.467 --> 01:04:29.816
Let's smoke a peace pipe.

574
01:04:33.646 --> 01:04:36.431
This is my special stash.

575
01:04:38.868 --> 01:04:39.739
Maggots?

576
01:04:41.001 --> 01:04:42.263
They're so small.

577
01:04:42.307 --> 01:04:44.004
But potent.

578
01:04:45.832 --> 01:04:47.790
They can't be that
frightful though.


579
01:04:47.834 --> 01:04:50.967
Oh, they are the great
death feeders of the world.


580
01:04:51.011 --> 01:04:53.448
Think about the
lifecycle of a fly.


581
01:04:53.492 --> 01:04:56.973
A fly feeds on death,
plants its eggs there,


582
01:04:57.017 --> 01:05:00.977
and then within that death
comes rebirth, maggots,


583
01:05:01.021 --> 01:05:03.806
which then feed on death
until they turn into flies.


584
01:05:03.850 --> 01:05:07.636
Then the whole cycle
starts over again.


585
01:05:07.680 --> 01:05:09.029
How magic is that?

586
01:05:10.030 --> 01:05:11.466
And these babies were chowing

587
01:05:11.510 --> 01:05:13.207
on one of the deer I
found in the forest,


588
01:05:13.251 --> 01:05:16.471
which looked like it came
to a pretty terrifying end.


589
01:05:16.515 --> 01:05:19.039
Trust me, there is
plenty to get ripped on.


590
01:05:21.694 --> 01:05:23.217
Try one.

591
01:05:37.405 --> 01:05:39.059
Let's fly.

592
01:05:39.102 --> 01:05:40.582
Come on, let's fly!

593
01:05:40.626 --> 01:05:43.237
It takes a lot more
than maggots to fly,


594
01:05:43.281 --> 01:05:44.499
you greedy cunt!

595
01:05:44.543 --> 01:05:47.763
Then you can have
your useless maggots!


596
01:06:09.132 --> 01:06:09.916
Oh my god!

597
01:06:29.588 --> 01:06:30.415
Bitch.

598
01:06:36.421 --> 01:06:37.987
Have you been in my dreams?

599
01:06:38.988 --> 01:06:40.425
We would make a great team.

600
01:06:46.605 --> 01:06:48.781
Oh, I don't feel so good.

601
01:06:52.219 --> 01:06:53.481
I need a shower.

602
01:06:59.139 --> 01:06:59.966
That was fun.

603
01:07:01.272 --> 01:07:05.798
Yeah, but we
cannot do that again.


604
01:07:05.841 --> 01:07:08.061
That was very, very bad.

605
01:07:13.675 --> 01:07:14.894
Tell me about your mom.

606
01:07:17.984 --> 01:07:19.464
She was a monster.

607
01:07:23.381 --> 01:07:25.165
She ate half a village.

608
01:07:27.385 --> 01:07:28.299
They were children.

609
01:07:30.997 --> 01:07:31.998
My friends.

610
01:07:36.524 --> 01:07:40.398
She felt so guilty, she
sewed her mouth shut.


611
01:07:43.052 --> 01:07:44.402
Did she starve to death?

612
01:07:46.360 --> 01:07:47.187
No.

613
01:07:48.536 --> 01:07:49.842
She was hanged.

614
01:07:52.366 --> 01:07:53.846
A waste of rope.

615
01:07:57.371 --> 01:07:59.852
So, then how'd she die?

616
01:08:01.723 --> 01:08:04.204
The way all hellbenders die.

617
01:08:05.423 --> 01:08:08.164
Spring eats winter,
winter eats fall.


618
01:08:08.208 --> 01:08:10.297
Fall eats summer.

619
01:08:16.042 --> 01:08:17.043
How old are you?

620
01:08:20.873 --> 01:08:23.919
147, I think.

621
01:08:25.878 --> 01:08:27.358
How old are you going to be?

622
01:08:31.318 --> 01:08:32.450
You tell me.

623
01:08:54.907 --> 01:08:55.734
Hey.

624
01:08:57.779 --> 01:08:59.694
What are you doing here?

625
01:08:59.738 --> 01:09:01.653
I just wanted to apologize.

626
01:09:03.132 --> 01:09:06.701
How, how did you
know I work here?


627
01:09:10.444 --> 01:09:12.098
You're stalking me.

628
01:09:12.141 --> 01:09:13.926
- Fucking psycho.
- Hold on, hold on.


629
01:09:14.927 --> 01:09:16.407
I just want to give you this.

630
01:09:18.974 --> 01:09:20.280
What is it?

631
01:09:20.323 --> 01:09:21.281
It's your bikini.

632
01:09:22.804 --> 01:09:24.240
Thanks.

633
01:09:24.284 --> 01:09:25.938
Thanks for letting me borrow it.

634
01:09:27.113 --> 01:09:28.636
No problem, hellbender.

635
01:09:29.855 --> 01:09:32.553
Sorry for being such
a weirdo last summer.


636
01:09:32.597 --> 01:09:33.380
It's cool.

637
01:09:35.338 --> 01:09:37.428
Can you believe what
happened to that guy?


638
01:09:38.472 --> 01:09:39.430
What guy?

639
01:09:39.473 --> 01:09:41.170
The guy who chased us.

640
01:09:41.214 --> 01:09:45.087
He got attacked by
some wild animal.


641
01:09:45.131 --> 01:09:46.437
Oh.

642
01:09:46.480 --> 01:09:47.655
That's crazy.

643
01:09:47.699 --> 01:09:49.744
I was hoping nothing
happened to you,


644
01:09:49.788 --> 01:09:51.616
even though you were
being a nutcase.


645
01:09:52.660 --> 01:09:54.140
Well, thanks for the bikini.

646
01:09:54.183 --> 01:09:55.794
Oh, I almost forgot.

647
01:09:57.317 --> 01:09:58.449
I want to give you these.

648
01:10:00.973 --> 01:10:02.191
Barrettes?

649
01:10:02.235 --> 01:10:04.106
They're yours.

650
01:10:04.150 --> 01:10:05.107
I kind of stole them from you

651
01:10:05.151 --> 01:10:06.805
when I first met
you at the pool.


652
01:10:11.331 --> 01:10:13.681
You know what,
back the fuck off!


653
01:10:54.896 --> 01:10:55.854
Hey, Izzy!

654
01:10:59.118 --> 01:10:59.858
Iz?

655
01:12:27.293 --> 01:12:28.294
Hey, Mom!

656
01:12:29.687 --> 01:12:32.820
You want to hear something
I wrote for Hellbender?


657
01:12:33.865 --> 01:12:34.648
Okay.

658
01:12:37.042 --> 01:12:39.479
There was a wolf who
longed to be a sheep.


659
01:12:40.698 --> 01:12:44.092
So, she cut her claws
and cracked her teeth.


660
01:12:44.136 --> 01:12:46.312
She buried deep
the wolf beneath.


661
01:12:47.574 --> 01:12:51.056
And when she bore a cub,
she raised it as a lamb.


662
01:12:52.231 --> 01:12:55.843
She cut its claws and
cracked its teeth.


663
01:12:55.887 --> 01:12:58.150
She buried deep
the wolf beneath.


664
01:12:59.325 --> 01:13:02.937
But when the lamb
grew, so did her claws.


665
01:13:02.981 --> 01:13:04.809
So, did her teeth.

666
01:13:04.852 --> 01:13:08.160
And the wolf ate her mother
who was just a sheep.


667
01:13:09.248 --> 01:13:10.684
You like it?

668
01:13:14.514 --> 01:13:15.994
Hey, did you meet
my friend Amber?


669
01:13:16.037 --> 01:13:20.346
She's still alive and
she's scared shitless.


670
01:13:33.446 --> 01:13:34.316
Cheers.

671
01:13:47.634 --> 01:13:49.027
Please!

672
01:13:56.774 --> 01:13:57.644
Help, help!

673
01:15:35.481 --> 01:15:36.221
Help me.

674
01:15:48.189 --> 01:15:49.800
Help!

675
01:15:57.329 --> 01:15:58.286
Fuck!

676
01:16:23.355 --> 01:16:25.966
Help, I wanna go home.

677
01:16:29.927 --> 01:16:33.060
Help.

678
01:16:33.104 --> 01:16:35.715
I can't, I can't move.

679
01:16:35.758 --> 01:16:36.716
Is she here?

680
01:16:37.935 --> 01:16:38.892
Please help.

681
01:16:40.894 --> 01:16:42.504
I can't move my body.

682
01:16:42.548 --> 01:16:46.421
Please help.

683
01:16:46.465 --> 01:16:50.904
Help.

684
01:16:50.948 --> 01:16:55.909
Help me, help me,
help, help.


685
01:16:56.562 --> 01:16:57.476
Please help.

686
01:16:59.391 --> 01:17:01.132
Let me out, let me go!

687
01:17:02.307 --> 01:17:04.048
Don't let her do this to me.

688
01:17:06.441 --> 01:17:08.922
Please don't leave me.

689
01:17:08.966 --> 01:17:10.881
Don't leave me.

690
01:17:10.924 --> 01:17:13.013
Please don't leave me!

691
01:17:13.057 --> 01:17:14.449
Please, help me please.

692
01:17:20.412 --> 01:17:23.719
Hey, Mom, that's
my friend Amber.


693
01:17:23.763 --> 01:17:27.027
Remember, we met her uncle
in the woods that day.


694
01:17:27.071 --> 01:17:28.942
I think you dusted him.

695
01:17:30.770 --> 01:17:34.034
Ooh, I like that trick.

696
01:17:34.078 --> 01:17:35.818
It's a great one to do
right in front of people.


697
01:17:35.862 --> 01:17:40.040
It just fuckin' paralyzes
them with fear, like Amber.


698
01:17:40.084 --> 01:17:42.260
I saw you take a taste.

699
01:17:42.303 --> 01:17:43.435
- No.
- Izzy...


700
01:17:44.871 --> 01:17:47.439
What, what have you done, what?

701
01:17:48.527 --> 01:17:50.181
What is this place?

702
01:17:51.269 --> 01:17:52.183
My happy place.

703
01:17:53.445 --> 01:17:55.490
I'm not gonna let
you kill this girl.


704
01:17:56.796 --> 01:17:59.799
I'm gonna save her
so I can save you.


705
01:17:59.842 --> 01:18:02.236
Save me from what?

706
01:18:04.456 --> 01:18:08.068
Izzy, I just wanted to save you

707
01:18:08.112 --> 01:18:10.418
from the hell that I've known.

708
01:18:10.462 --> 01:18:13.769
I just wanted us to be...

709
01:18:13.813 --> 01:18:15.336
Please!

710
01:18:15.380 --> 01:18:16.642
People.

711
01:18:16.685 --> 01:18:18.165
People?

712
01:18:18.209 --> 01:18:20.211
Like the people
you've kept me from?


713
01:18:21.299 --> 01:18:22.126
Like Amber?

714
01:18:23.649 --> 01:18:26.304
The people that believe
in good and evil?


715
01:18:27.479 --> 01:18:28.697
God and the devil?

716
01:18:32.005 --> 01:18:33.964
If they want to believe
in hell so badly,


717
01:18:35.008 --> 01:18:36.096
I'll give 'em hell.

718
01:18:36.140 --> 01:18:37.837
Let me go!

719
01:18:37.880 --> 01:18:38.838
Izzy, you're good.

720
01:18:40.013 --> 01:18:42.363
I raised you to be good.

721
01:18:44.017 --> 01:18:44.844
Not evil.

722
01:18:47.847 --> 01:18:49.980
I saw the book.

723
01:18:50.023 --> 01:18:54.985
The blood, the bodies,
the babies, the terror.


724
01:18:56.508 --> 01:18:59.685
I listened to your secrets
and I watched your dreams.


725
01:19:01.165 --> 01:19:02.253
I know the truth, Mom.

726
01:19:04.690 --> 01:19:07.127
I did what I was taught to do.

727
01:19:07.171 --> 01:19:08.737
And you denied me that right.

728
01:19:09.869 --> 01:19:11.523
Right.

729
01:19:12.698 --> 01:19:16.615
To be a tool for the
hands of hell.


730
01:19:18.095 --> 01:19:19.618
It's not a gift, Izzy.

731
01:19:20.793 --> 01:19:22.534
Then why was it given?

732
01:19:24.101 --> 01:19:26.625
I know the only way
a hellbender can die.


733
01:19:27.887 --> 01:19:30.890
Winter eats fall,
fall eats summer,


734
01:19:32.065 --> 01:19:35.373
summer eats spring,
and spring eats winter.


735
01:19:36.809 --> 01:19:40.378
Did your mother
sacrifice herself or?


736
01:19:41.901 --> 01:19:42.728
I think I know.

737
01:19:44.730 --> 01:19:45.557
Watch out, Mom.

738
01:19:47.211 --> 01:19:49.039
You might turn into
a real hellbender.


739
01:19:50.953 --> 01:19:52.520
I know you're in there.

740
01:19:52.564 --> 01:19:54.044
Show me.

741
01:19:59.223 --> 01:20:00.050
Let me see.

742
01:20:02.922 --> 01:20:03.923
There you are.

743
01:20:05.751 --> 01:20:06.752
You're so beautiful.

744
01:20:09.668 --> 01:20:10.451
Thank you.

745
01:20:12.410 --> 01:20:13.976
Now, it's my turn.

746
01:20:14.020 --> 01:20:16.022
I'm not afraid of you, Izzy.

747
01:20:17.458 --> 01:20:18.242
You will be.

748
01:20:30.254 --> 01:20:34.388
Help, please help me.

749
01:20:50.883 --> 01:20:53.103
Don't, I'm not ready.

750
01:20:53.146 --> 01:20:54.756
I'm not ready.

751
01:20:54.800 --> 01:20:55.844
I'm not ready.

752
01:20:55.888 --> 01:20:57.107
I'm not, don't.

753
01:20:58.804 --> 01:21:01.676
Mom, I'm not gonna eat you.

754
01:21:03.287 --> 01:21:05.289
I'm not ready to have
a little hellbender.


755
01:21:07.465 --> 01:21:08.640
And I love you.

756
01:21:10.859 --> 01:21:13.471
I'm going to town,
you need anything?


757
01:21:14.863 --> 01:21:17.127
Bass strings.

758
01:21:17.170 --> 01:21:17.997
You got it.

759
01:21:28.226 --> 01:21:33.226
