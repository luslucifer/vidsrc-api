1
00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:00.589
Wait, it's hard, get the towel.

2
00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:01.581
Let's go, babe.

3
00:01:01.932 --> 00:01:02.236
You ready?

4
00:01:02.605 --> 00:01:02.797
Yeah.

5
00:01:03.308 --> 00:01:03.885
Oh, God.

6
00:01:04.413 --> 00:01:05.676
Come on, we need to get a deal.

7
00:01:06.108 --> 00:01:06.972
Come on, squeeze in.

8
00:01:07.355 --> 00:01:08.923
You know his daddy wanted
him to be a surgeon.

9
00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.420
Luckily, your daddy likes me
just the way I do.

10
00:01:11.516 --> 00:01:12.220
Oh, my God.

11
00:01:12.893 --> 00:01:13.147
Oh, my God.

12
00:01:13.356 --> 00:01:13.548
Help us.

13
00:01:13.867 --> 00:01:15.228
And we're in, oh, my God.

14
00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:15.836
God!

15
00:01:18.012 --> 00:01:18.844
I can't believe there's a party.

16
00:01:27.611 --> 00:01:35.147
I'm going to go watch
up front, break a leg.

17
00:01:35.147 --> 00:01:35.850
Oh, my God.

18
00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.914
I love that phrase when I'm wearing heels.

19
00:01:38.714 --> 00:01:38.907
Bang.

20
00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:41.003
Bye.

21
00:01:48.905 --> 00:01:49.113
What?

22
00:01:50.746 --> 00:01:52.090
Oh, my God, friends kiss.

23
00:01:52.474 --> 00:01:52.858
I didn't say anything.

24
00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:56.489
Anton, babe, how long do I have left?

25
00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:58.170
About 20 minutes.

26
00:02:00.713 --> 00:02:01.066
What?

27
00:02:02.008 --> 00:02:03.192
We just talked up there.

28
00:02:03.192 --> 00:02:03.849
Look down.

29
00:02:05.112 --> 00:02:05.944
I see that, right?

30
00:02:06.345 --> 00:02:06.745
Okay, good.

31
00:02:07.321 --> 00:02:07.816
Down to the left.

32
00:02:08.217 --> 00:02:08.649
Look at that.

33
00:02:24.568 --> 00:02:26.056
Oh, you scared him away.

34
00:02:26.521 --> 00:02:27.128
It's cute, babe.

35
00:06:14.971 --> 00:06:15.659
Hey, what do you say?

36
00:06:17.498 --> 00:06:18.170
You talk to me.

37
00:06:18.427 --> 00:06:18.619
Thanks.

38
00:06:19.611 --> 00:06:20.171
Hey, what do you say?

39
00:06:20.171 --> 00:06:20.570
Thanks, please.

40
00:06:22.345 --> 00:06:23.370
Do you want to
say that to my face?

41
00:06:23.802 --> 00:06:25.354
She's a big man in his high heels.

42
00:06:25.802 --> 00:06:26.618
Turn around and say that.

43
00:06:28.153 --> 00:06:29.706
All right, turn around then.

44
00:06:30.826 --> 00:06:31.482
Turn around.

45
00:06:34.026 --> 00:06:38.601
I said, how are you going to call me a faggot in front
of all of your friends when I call you checking me out earlier?


46
00:06:44.202 --> 00:06:46.585
You lot know each other.

47
00:06:46.825 --> 00:06:47.401
Fuck off, man.

48
00:06:47.401 --> 00:06:47.945
He's chatting shit.

49
00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:51.960
Babes, don't bother
messaging me later when you're looking for


50
00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:55.368
a dick to suck, because you
and your don't touch the size dick.


51
00:06:55.976 --> 00:06:56.424
No, my type.

52
00:06:57.304 --> 00:06:58.264
Oh, fuck.

53
00:06:58.392 --> 00:06:59.080
Hey, hey, hey.

54
00:06:59.352 --> 00:07:00.200
Hold that for me, yeah?

55
00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:01.128
Hold that for me.

56
00:07:01.128 --> 00:07:01.657
Oh, he's gone.

57
00:07:01.992 --> 00:07:02.712
What's going on?

58
00:07:02.952 --> 00:07:03.623
All right, we're on.

59
00:07:03.623 --> 00:07:04.007
We're on.

60
00:07:04.007 --> 00:07:04.199
Come.

61
00:07:07.751 --> 00:07:08.087
Hey.

62
00:07:08.087 --> 00:07:08.375
Hey.

63
00:07:08.744 --> 00:07:10.312
All right, come on, man.

64
00:07:11.272 --> 00:07:12.408
What are you going to do, bro?

65
00:07:12.552 --> 00:07:14.679
This man-woman humiliated you.

66
00:07:15.015 --> 00:07:15.911
Where are you going?

67
00:07:18.743 --> 00:07:19.366
Turn around, then.

68
00:07:19.430 --> 00:07:21.190
Turn around and smile for the camera, please.

69
00:07:21.223 --> 00:07:22.503
Turn around if you're a fucking man.

70
00:07:22.919 --> 00:07:23.895
Hey, fuck your mother, man.

71
00:07:24.647 --> 00:07:25.126
What did I say?

72
00:07:25.126 --> 00:07:25.831
I said turn around.

73
00:07:27.046 --> 00:07:27.558
Fuck off!

74
00:07:28.455 --> 00:07:29.351
Oh, fuck off.

75
00:07:29.879 --> 00:07:30.742
Holy shit.

76
00:07:31.142 --> 00:07:31.382
Fuck off.

77
00:07:31.942 --> 00:07:32.678
Get out of there.

78
00:07:32.870 --> 00:07:33.830
Get your big man.

79
00:07:33.830 --> 00:07:34.853
Get your big man.

80
00:07:34.853 --> 00:07:36.421
Why you wearing a fucking dress, bro?

81
00:07:36.421 --> 00:07:37.605
You're a fucking big man, right?

82
00:07:37.893 --> 00:07:39.910
All right.

83
00:07:40.486 --> 00:07:41.478
Get all your names.

84
00:07:42.213 --> 00:07:43.173
Get all your fucking names.

85
00:07:43.718 --> 00:07:44.726
Don't do fucking these.

86
00:07:45.014 --> 00:07:45.510
Fuck, stop it.

87
00:07:45.782 --> 00:07:47.077
Get your fucking dress up.

88
00:07:47.077 --> 00:07:48.277
Get your fucking dress up.

89
00:07:48.277 --> 00:07:48.581
That's it.

90
00:07:48.965 --> 00:07:49.221
That's it.

91
00:07:49.717 --> 00:07:50.037
You're getting all these--

92
00:07:50.293 --> 00:07:51.077
You're not here, you're not.

93
00:07:51.525 --> 00:07:52.485
You didn't say that to me, eh?

94
00:07:52.549 --> 00:07:53.365
You didn't say that to me?

95
00:07:54.212 --> 00:07:55.861
Bro, F is holding, holding, man.

96
00:07:56.469 --> 00:07:58.069
Who's the big man now, ah?

97
00:07:58.213 --> 00:07:59.557
Who's the fucking big man now?

98
00:07:59.588 --> 00:08:01.060
You're the fucking big man.

99
00:08:01.060 --> 00:08:02.692
I'm the fucking big man.

100
00:08:05.348 --> 00:08:06.036
You're the fucking freak.

101
00:08:46.001 --> 00:08:46.738
Lisa, get help.

102
00:08:47.602 --> 00:08:47.842
Lisa!

103
00:08:49.218 --> 00:08:50.370
All right, brother.

104
00:08:50.465 --> 00:08:53.346
Stop fucking looking and get in evidence.

105
00:09:24.240 --> 00:09:25.792
Babes?

106
00:09:27.567 --> 00:09:29.600
Babes?

107
00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:29.648
Yeah.

108
00:09:31.743 --> 00:09:34.656
I threw together this
little bad girl this morning,

109
00:09:34.656 --> 00:09:38.016
so you could wear my
old one if you wanted.

110
00:09:40.607 --> 00:09:42.654
I know you can pause,
so don't even try it.

111
00:09:43.422 --> 00:09:44.846
I can, but I don't want to.

112
00:09:48.078 --> 00:09:49.614
Why stay here playing?

113
00:09:50.959 --> 00:09:52.095
Whatever the fuck this is.

114
00:09:52.527 --> 00:09:55.182
When you could meet that guy
in real life, like the clerk.

115
00:09:55.837 --> 00:09:57.214
I don't want to be in real life.

116
00:09:57.726 --> 00:09:58.350
Portions are horrible.

117
00:09:58.750 --> 00:10:00.365
Can you look at me
when I'm speaking to you?

118
00:10:00.670 --> 00:10:02.782
I'm trying to suggest with my body language

119
00:10:03.422 --> 00:10:04.894
that I don't want to start this again.

120
00:10:05.933 --> 00:10:06.253
Babes?

121
00:10:07.374 --> 00:10:09.182
It's not really the night
before it's even begun yet?

122
00:10:09.182 --> 00:10:10.492
I'm trying to be a good friend.

123
00:10:10.492 --> 00:10:11.244
This isn't healthy.

124
00:10:11.916 --> 00:10:12.797
But he doesn't want to come out.

125
00:10:17.021 --> 00:10:18.653
Every time you do
this, you're letting them win.

126
00:10:20.317 --> 00:10:20.509
Brilliant.

127
00:10:21.454 --> 00:10:22.716
Whatever. It's his life.

128
00:12:28.085 --> 00:12:36.837
Hi. Hi.

129
00:12:39.860 --> 00:12:42.100
Not tonight.

130
00:12:43.829 --> 00:12:44.549
You're gorgeous.

131
00:12:45.013 --> 00:12:45.524
Thank you.

132
00:12:48.148 --> 00:12:49.556
I am nine inches in thick.

133
00:12:50.643 --> 00:12:51.668
Maybe another time in there.

134
00:12:53.187 --> 00:12:54.020
That's unbeautiful.

135
00:13:13.028 --> 00:13:21.602
What did I just say?

136
00:13:22.098 --> 00:13:22.290
Alright.

137
00:13:22.898 --> 00:13:24.067
So what are you talking to me for?

138
00:13:25.970 --> 00:13:26.754
Just chill out, mate.

139
00:13:27.826 --> 00:13:29.954
Back the fuck up
before I fucking slap you.

140
00:13:30.163 --> 00:13:30.610
Bloody psycho.

141
00:13:30.770 --> 00:13:32.065
You're fucking dog's break.

142
00:13:32.065 --> 00:13:32.801
You're calling, yeah?

143
00:13:33.185 --> 00:13:34.065
You're just charring us and you.

144
00:13:34.290 --> 00:13:34.801
Calm down.

145
00:13:35.106 --> 00:13:36.625
I've called it poor faggot.

146
00:13:37.777 --> 00:13:39.073
We're old faggots here, darling.

147
00:13:41.778 --> 00:13:42.785
Fucking shit hole anyway.

148
00:14:48.525 --> 00:14:49.485
Coming in.

149
00:15:40.362 --> 00:15:41.242
You got a free place?

150
00:15:42.761 --> 00:15:42.953
No.

151
00:16:08.137 --> 00:16:12.744
Keep your mouth shut.

152
00:16:17.944 --> 00:16:18.984
Fung, where the fuck did you go?

153
00:16:19.384 --> 00:16:20.521
I shit the sweat out, innit?

154
00:16:20.713 --> 00:16:21.576
You were a liability.

155
00:16:22.920 --> 00:16:23.559
Nah, mate.

156
00:16:23.559 --> 00:16:24.439
Just border your chat.

157
00:16:26.312 --> 00:16:26.952
You back of the flat?

158
00:16:27.544 --> 00:16:29.767
Nah, I'm still out
waiting for this geezer, innit?

159
00:16:30.567 --> 00:16:32.072
Don't know what the fuck
he thinks he's playing at.

160
00:16:32.328 --> 00:16:33.368
You need to change your art, man.

161
00:16:33.943 --> 00:16:34.455
Trust me.

162
00:16:35.383 --> 00:16:38.119
You're probably gonna go
junction afterwards if you fancy it.


163
00:16:38.919 --> 00:16:40.326
Aye, yeah, I'll see how I feel.

164
00:16:40.807 --> 00:16:41.479
Aye, safe, safe.

165
00:17:09.989 --> 00:17:10.645
We'll be right here.

166
00:17:11.077 --> 00:17:12.166
Don't let no one see you coming.

167
00:17:36.276 --> 00:17:37.011
Anyone see you?

168
00:17:37.475 --> 00:17:44.003
No. What a beer.

169
00:17:47.604 --> 00:17:48.548
I'm okay, thanks.

170
00:17:50.083 --> 00:17:50.595
Shoes off.

171
00:18:14.530 --> 00:18:15.394
Shut the door.

172
00:18:17.762 --> 00:18:20.097
So what's your name?

173
00:18:21.841 --> 00:18:23.408
I don't want to
hear any noise, you understand?

174
00:18:24.448 --> 00:18:26.017
You make a noise, 
I'm gonna copy your mouth.

175
00:18:28.177 --> 00:18:28.801
Take your clothes off.

176
00:18:33.152 --> 00:18:33.855
Good boy.

177
00:18:55.824 --> 00:18:56.240
When you're front.

178
00:19:37.917 --> 00:19:40.653
I don't wanna know.

179
00:19:42.141 --> 00:19:43.197
I don't wanna make a beer, I think.

180
00:19:45.756 --> 00:19:47.197
Don't fucking move, yeah?

181
00:19:55.724 --> 00:19:56.780
Where are you, man?

182
00:19:57.628 --> 00:19:59.132
Aye, give me a fucking minute, man.

183
00:19:59.867 --> 00:20:09.867
Aye, I need a piece.

184
00:20:29.305 --> 00:20:30.330
Who's the big man now, huh?

185
00:20:31.194 --> 00:20:32.810
Let me take the
fucking dress off that shit.

186
00:21:09.176 --> 00:21:12.183
Shut up, president.

187
00:21:12.519 --> 00:21:13.624
Give me one of them.

188
00:21:14.086 --> 00:21:14.759
You're not lying.

189
00:21:14.759 --> 00:21:16.167
You're rolling fucking up, I'm good.

190
00:21:16.823 --> 00:21:18.424
Cutting up selfish lies.

191
00:21:19.319 --> 00:21:21.143
Rolling, smoking the crack cocaine.

192
00:21:23.063 --> 00:21:25.334
Hey, who's that?

193
00:21:25.814 --> 00:21:26.374
What, the son of the--

194
00:21:26.950 --> 00:21:28.166
Someone's creeping.

195
00:21:28.742 --> 00:21:29.830
You got a girl in there.

196
00:21:30.743 --> 00:21:31.925
He's creeping.

197
00:21:32.662 --> 00:21:34.647
He's got a girl in there.

198
00:21:36.662 --> 00:21:37.366
Who's this?

199
00:21:38.997 --> 00:21:40.149
It's my mate, innit?

200
00:21:42.997 --> 00:21:44.325
What, you're not telling me
you're bringing your boy over?

201
00:21:46.485 --> 00:21:47.734
You're my fucking minder now.

202
00:21:50.342 --> 00:21:51.494
That's where he's trying to keep me busy

203
00:21:51.494 --> 00:21:53.236
while some chug rubs me blind.

204
00:21:54.773 --> 00:21:55.364
What's your name, brother?

205
00:21:56.101 --> 00:21:56.372
Jules.

206
00:21:56.725 --> 00:21:57.717
You didn't know my yard, Jules?

207
00:21:58.677 --> 00:21:59.604
Just picking up, innit?

208
00:22:00.164 --> 00:22:00.564
A bit late.

209
00:22:01.460 --> 00:22:01.892
No, no.

210
00:22:02.549 --> 00:22:03.349
All right, obviously sleep.

211
00:22:05.460 --> 00:22:06.596
Where do you lot know each other from?

212
00:22:06.964 --> 00:22:07.285
Pittenville.

213
00:22:09.652 --> 00:22:10.580
Ah, scene.

214
00:22:11.363 --> 00:22:12.403
You're man with soulmates, yeah?

215
00:22:12.756 --> 00:22:13.940
Shut up, man.

216
00:22:17.779 --> 00:22:19.332
Do you want to be a Jules?

217
00:22:19.604 --> 00:22:22.338
You could come tell us some stories
about Preston getting bobbed in the big house.


218
00:22:22.338 --> 00:22:23.954
I think you're funny, innit?

219
00:22:24.179 --> 00:22:24.803
No, no, no.

220
00:22:25.972 --> 00:22:27.043
You know what, 
I'm gonna bounce.

221
00:22:27.395 --> 00:22:28.674
Oh, rude.

222
00:22:29.251 --> 00:22:29.635
That's it.

223
00:22:30.403 --> 00:22:30.931
Inevitable.

224
00:22:31.331 --> 00:22:32.147
I'm gonna have him take his press camera.

225
00:22:38.034 --> 00:22:38.050
Press camera.

226
00:22:38.050 --> 00:22:44.627
Put your number on my phone.

227
00:22:46.690 --> 00:22:48.466
I need to get my clothes back, innit?

228
00:22:56.146 --> 00:22:56.401
Yeah.

229
00:22:59.090 --> 00:23:00.785
You gonna wait for my text, yeah?

230
00:23:02.161 --> 00:23:02.865
Yeah.

231
00:23:04.081 --> 00:23:04.545
Good boy.

232
00:23:49.069 --> 00:23:51.998
It's so good to be back.

233
00:23:52.382 --> 00:23:53.038
So good.

234
00:23:53.294 --> 00:23:54.734
I'll tell you what,
that last girl was in.

235
00:23:55.022 --> 00:23:55.694
I can't help it.

236
00:27:29.346 --> 00:27:29.954
What's your mark-up?

237
00:27:31.073 --> 00:27:31.313
Exactly.

238
00:27:31.698 --> 00:27:32.353
Hard cash value.

239
00:27:32.353 --> 00:27:33.186
What is your time worth?

240
00:27:37.697 --> 00:27:39.041
So what, you just starting a new account?

241
00:27:39.296 --> 00:27:40.064
You ain't got your address?

242
00:27:45.617 --> 00:27:47.377
Yeah, listen, my mates just turned up, yeah?

243
00:27:48.018 --> 00:27:49.056
You call me tomorrow.

244
00:27:49.889 --> 00:27:50.913
Hey, hey, hey.

245
00:27:51.169 --> 00:27:51.649
All right.

246
00:27:54.752 --> 00:27:55.440
All right?

247
00:27:56.640 --> 00:27:56.992
Yeah.

248
00:27:59.632 --> 00:27:59.920
Are you?

249
00:28:17.375 --> 00:28:18.351
You going shopping just for me?

250
00:28:19.775 --> 00:28:19.936
No.

251
00:28:22.111 --> 00:28:23.294
No, I needed new stuff anyway.

252
00:28:25.119 --> 00:28:25.407
Did you now?

253
00:28:29.278 --> 00:28:31.743
I forgot your hoodie, by the way.

254
00:28:31.743 --> 00:28:31.935
Sorry.

255
00:28:32.303 --> 00:28:32.671
Keep it.

256
00:28:33.647 --> 00:28:34.591
It's a knock-off anyway.

257
00:28:34.909 --> 00:28:36.110
I don't wear that shit no more.

258
00:28:39.006 --> 00:28:41.085
If you're on a budget, though,
I can get you more of that on a cheap.


259
00:28:42.158 --> 00:28:42.766
It looks real.

260
00:28:43.038 --> 00:28:43.421
That's the job.

261
00:28:47.006 --> 00:28:48.238
Fucking maniac!

262
00:29:08.635 --> 00:29:11.516
Can I get some water, potato?

263
00:29:11.516 --> 00:29:15.276
Yeah, can we get a bottle of
sparkling, a pint of Brixton, and, uh...


264
00:29:15.516 --> 00:29:16.540
Can we get the wine list?

265
00:29:17.084 --> 00:29:18.204
Oh, yeah, it's at
the back of the movie.

266
00:29:19.195 --> 00:29:23.179
Do you know what? 
A housewife would be good.

267
00:29:23.435 --> 00:29:23.899
What do you recommend?

268
00:29:24.763 --> 00:29:27.579
I mean, well, I
personally like the French souvenir.

269
00:29:28.251 --> 00:29:30.716
It's a little lighter, very drinkable.

270
00:29:31.195 --> 00:29:31.883
Glass it up, please.

271
00:29:32.538 --> 00:29:32.794
Great.

272
00:29:41.243 --> 00:29:41.995
Yeah, it's all right, this place.

273
00:29:42.443 --> 00:29:43.130
No, yeah.

274
00:29:43.530 --> 00:29:44.122
It seems really nice.

275
00:29:44.122 --> 00:29:48.809
Don't worry, it's on me. No,
no, no, no, no, no, no, it's on me.


276
00:29:49.689 --> 00:29:51.593
So, listen.

277
00:29:52.650 --> 00:29:54.345
It was a bit of a
madness what you did the other night.

278
00:29:55.065 --> 00:29:55.882
Sorry about that.

279
00:29:55.882 --> 00:29:57.161
No, no, no, I
kind of rate it still.

280
00:29:58.218 --> 00:30:00.153
It would have been a
different story if you fucked up, but...


281
00:30:01.017 --> 00:30:01.881
I don't need to go into that.

282
00:30:02.265 --> 00:30:03.161
Hey, so...

283
00:30:04.329 --> 00:30:04.617
I understand.

284
00:30:06.537 --> 00:30:07.528
Can we order some food?

285
00:30:07.961 --> 00:30:08.281
Yeah.

286
00:30:08.281 --> 00:30:08.921
You hungry, yeah?

287
00:30:09.081 --> 00:30:14.041
We get a Chateau Briont,
say 400, 500 grams. Rare as you go.


288
00:30:14.473 --> 00:30:14.649
Great.

289
00:30:15.033 --> 00:30:20.120
We get a smoked bone marrow,
beef fat potatoes, grilled hispy,


290
00:30:20.488 --> 00:30:22.329
and a few sauces.

291
00:30:23.336 --> 00:30:23.751
Surprise me.

292
00:30:24.200 --> 00:30:24.472
Absolutely.

293
00:30:24.472 --> 00:30:34.472
Yeah. Cheers, isn't it?

294
00:30:46.966 --> 00:30:56.966
So, what is this, like...

295
00:30:58.485 --> 00:30:59.557
This is like a MO.

296
00:31:00.246 --> 00:31:00.870
My MO.

297
00:31:02.118 --> 00:31:03.701
Dinner dates with boys
and men, so what is?

298
00:31:05.749 --> 00:31:06.758
Nah, not usually.

299
00:31:07.142 --> 00:31:07.334
OK.

300
00:31:08.470 --> 00:31:09.589
So, what makes me so special?

301
00:31:10.918 --> 00:31:11.894
I'll have to get back
to you on that one.

302
00:31:12.693 --> 00:31:13.381
Oh, shit.

303
00:31:15.413 --> 00:31:15.749
Same.

304
00:31:17.477 --> 00:31:18.005
And I'm just...

305
00:31:19.285 --> 00:31:20.757
I'm just trying to work
out what the vibe is here.

306
00:31:22.421 --> 00:31:22.805
What do you mean?

307
00:31:23.525 --> 00:31:25.492
I'm not imagining double
dates with your friends anytime soon.


308
00:31:27.635 --> 00:31:28.020
You're funny.

309
00:31:30.708 --> 00:31:32.371
You keep your side
of your life completely separate.

310
00:31:33.956 --> 00:31:34.852
I'm a private person.

311
00:31:35.349 --> 00:31:36.868
You know, I don't like
people getting in my business.

312
00:31:38.500 --> 00:31:39.316
You got a girlfriend.

313
00:31:41.699 --> 00:31:42.371
Not at the moment, no.

314
00:31:43.491 --> 00:31:44.467
Would you like it if I did?

315
00:31:47.171 --> 00:31:47.699
Why would I like that?

316
00:31:50.195 --> 00:31:50.963
OK.

317
00:31:52.051 --> 00:31:52.916
OK.

318
00:31:53.572 --> 00:31:54.419
I see you.

319
00:31:54.611 --> 00:31:55.299
Mm-hm. Mm-hm.

320
00:31:55.587 --> 00:31:55.779
What?

321
00:31:57.586 --> 00:31:59.506
What do you think
I'd do for a living?

322
00:32:03.346 --> 00:32:04.419
You think I'm a dealer, innit?

323
00:32:05.906 --> 00:32:06.562
Is that what you're into?

324
00:32:07.762 --> 00:32:09.555
You want a big man to
treat you like a little bitch?

325
00:32:12.689 --> 00:32:13.201
Maybe.

326
00:32:15.681 --> 00:32:16.897
Yeah, I knew you were tight.

327
00:32:20.625 --> 00:32:22.865
Well, if that's what you're after,

328
00:32:23.505 --> 00:32:25.009
I could fill up your bingo card.

329
00:32:25.856 --> 00:32:28.528
Shot in, GBH, downtime, all of it.

330
00:32:29.264 --> 00:32:29.376
Mm-hm.

331
00:32:30.608 --> 00:32:31.232
What were you in for?

332
00:32:31.921 --> 00:32:33.697
I don't want to talk about that.

333
00:32:34.112 --> 00:32:35.792
Yes, I do.

334
00:32:37.360 --> 00:32:37.521
Cash.

335
00:32:52.303 --> 00:32:52.992
Thank you.

336
00:32:54.255 --> 00:32:54.799
Jesus.

337
00:34:44.617 --> 00:34:46.313
This is what you're after, yeah?

338
00:34:47.113 --> 00:34:48.424
You want to get fucked
in the house by a thug?

339
00:34:52.296 --> 00:34:54.888
This is what you get off of.

340
00:34:56.505 --> 00:34:57.720
You answer me when I speak to you?

341
00:34:59.448 --> 00:34:59.609
Yes.

342
00:35:00.185 --> 00:35:00.617
This what?

343
00:35:02.711 --> 00:35:03.671
Yes, I want it.

344
00:36:12.324 --> 00:36:13.860
What the fuck?

345
00:36:26.724 --> 00:36:30.034
But I didn't make it myself.

346
00:36:30.594 --> 00:36:33.923
I got like, material from
like, just down the road.

347
00:36:33.923 --> 00:36:35.331
It just happened once, happened, sorry.

348
00:36:40.338 --> 00:36:41.699
Sorry, I should have texted you.

349
00:36:41.747 --> 00:36:42.803
Yeah.

350
00:36:42.803 --> 00:36:44.643
Bit of a surprise.

351
00:36:44.643 --> 00:36:47.233
Playing Anton, it was meant
to be like, five people.

352
00:36:50.722 --> 00:36:51.202
Where you been?

353
00:36:52.802 --> 00:36:53.202
With a friend.

354
00:36:54.962 --> 00:36:57.520
Like a friend or a date.

355
00:36:59.184 --> 00:37:02.784
Sorry, I just like, 
I don't know what's going on with you.

356
00:37:03.072 --> 00:37:03.616
What do you mean?

357
00:37:05.521 --> 00:37:05.697
Just miss my friend.

358
00:37:09.761 --> 00:37:10.017
Okay.

359
00:37:10.721 --> 00:37:11.792
Can I have a hug?

360
00:37:28.991 --> 00:37:29.199
No.

361
00:37:30.224 --> 00:37:30.416
Sorry.

362
00:37:30.736 --> 00:37:31.088
It's okay.

363
00:37:31.487 --> 00:37:31.615
Just, okay.

364
00:37:31.663 --> 00:37:34.767
Just find it a hug.

365
00:37:35.231 --> 00:37:35.439
I know.

366
00:37:35.696 --> 00:37:36.640
Like it's just alcohol.

367
00:37:36.975 --> 00:37:39.903
I'm just drunk and fucking hate it.

368
00:37:41.150 --> 00:37:42.718
Sorry, I'm such an idiot.

369
00:38:03.454 --> 00:38:03.806
Hi.

370
00:38:04.286 --> 00:38:04.958
I'm so lazy.

371
00:38:05.246 --> 00:38:05.885
It's just alcohol.

372
00:38:06.253 --> 00:38:07.470
I fucking hate it.

373
00:38:07.470 --> 00:38:08.270
I know, baby.

374
00:38:08.462 --> 00:38:09.053
It's the worst.

375
00:38:10.637 --> 00:38:11.388
Come on, let's go.

376
00:38:11.597 --> 00:38:12.269
Let's get you in.

377
00:40:21.238 --> 00:40:21.382
Liz?

378
00:40:24.437 --> 00:40:25.462
You got a fayon flower?

379
00:40:25.990 --> 00:40:26.870
What for?

380
00:40:28.853 --> 00:40:29.157
Cute.

381
00:40:30.214 --> 00:40:30.485
Yes.

382
00:40:30.773 --> 00:40:31.190
Love this.

383
00:40:31.462 --> 00:40:31.654
Okay.

384
00:40:31.861 --> 00:40:33.701
Do that thing where you look
at me but don't look at me.

385
00:40:34.070 --> 00:40:34.484
Look at me.

386
00:40:34.484 --> 00:40:34.948
I'm shy.

387
00:40:35.365 --> 00:40:36.372
I'm so shy.

388
00:40:36.964 --> 00:40:37.605
Work it.

389
00:40:37.909 --> 00:40:38.693
Work it.

390
00:40:38.693 --> 00:40:39.173
Gorgeous.

391
00:40:42.565 --> 00:40:43.477
Cute.

392
00:40:43.477 --> 00:40:44.229
Cute.

393
00:40:44.437 --> 00:40:44.741
Cute.

394
00:40:44.741 --> 00:40:45.764
Now your face is banging.

395
00:41:18.146 --> 00:41:19.634
What the fuck?

396
00:41:20.242 --> 00:41:20.466
What?

397
00:41:21.074 --> 00:41:22.866
You don't know who's looking.

398
00:41:24.194 --> 00:41:24.307
You don't know who's looking.

399
00:41:24.307 --> 00:41:25.491
Oh, but I look cute there, right?

400
00:41:25.603 --> 00:41:26.289
No, I'm serious.

401
00:41:29.810 --> 00:41:29.970
Sorry.

402
00:41:32.705 --> 00:41:37.489
I've just been thinking about you.

403
00:41:41.794 --> 00:41:42.162
What are you up to?

404
00:41:48.912 --> 00:41:49.808
You're a glutton from one issue.

405
00:41:51.792 --> 00:41:53.137
Can I tell your friends about me?

406
00:41:55.072 --> 00:41:56.433
Can I tell your friends about me?

407
00:41:56.433 --> 00:41:56.625
No.

408
00:41:57.217 --> 00:41:57.968
What would I do?

409
00:41:59.104 --> 00:41:59.999
Who's helping me?

410
00:42:00.719 --> 00:42:01.439
Oh, my God.

411
00:42:02.368 --> 00:42:04.096
Oh, oh.

412
00:42:04.944 --> 00:42:06.863
Oh, oh.

413
00:42:07.456 --> 00:42:08.160
Oh, oh.

414
00:42:08.160 --> 00:42:08.608
Oh, God.

415
00:42:09.088 --> 00:42:09.680
Oh, oh.

416
00:42:10.432 --> 00:42:13.134
Oh, oh.

417
00:42:13.134 --> 00:42:22.863
Oh, oh.

418
00:42:23.871 --> 00:42:24.559
Same again, yeah?

419
00:42:25.904 --> 00:42:26.079
Yeah.

420
00:42:32.110 --> 00:42:34.078
Something is, yeah, 
I'm a nice guy.

421
00:42:35.134 --> 00:42:36.878
If you disrespect me, fuck you up.

422
00:42:36.926 --> 00:42:38.350
-You'll forget that. 
-Yeah?

423
00:42:38.974 --> 00:42:40.334
-I'm sick. 
-Are you not?

424
00:42:40.622 --> 00:42:40.878
Yeah.

425
00:42:42.669 --> 00:42:45.485
Okay, let's remember not
to fuck with you then.

426
00:43:08.604 --> 00:43:15.804
What the fuck?

427
00:43:17.228 --> 00:43:17.643
Fuck you.

428
00:43:18.411 --> 00:43:18.908
Turn it off.

429
00:43:19.884 --> 00:43:21.259
What the fuck are
you doing? Turn it off.

430
00:43:22.027 --> 00:43:23.004
It's off, it's off.

431
00:43:24.300 --> 00:43:25.675
Get the fuck out of my car.

432
00:43:25.995 --> 00:43:26.682
I'm sorry, I thought you were--

433
00:43:26.682 --> 00:43:28.459
No, fuck you up. 
Did you think I was joking?

434
00:43:28.459 --> 00:43:28.843
No, I was--

435
00:43:28.970 --> 00:43:29.899
Did you think I was joking?

436
00:43:30.139 --> 00:43:31.387
No, no, no, don't test me then.

437
00:43:32.586 --> 00:43:33.962
I'm sorry.

438
00:43:33.962 --> 00:43:36.331
Delete it. Delete it now.

439
00:43:37.914 --> 00:43:38.843
Are you--

440
00:43:39.402 --> 00:43:40.202
Fuck, son of a--

441
00:43:42.443 --> 00:43:48.395
I told you I don't
want my face or nothing.

442
00:43:49.354 --> 00:43:50.778
I don't know-
- I don't know you like that.

443
00:43:50.778 --> 00:43:51.610
I don't know what you're about.

444
00:43:52.746 --> 00:43:53.801
I'm sorry, man.

445
00:43:54.665 --> 00:43:55.113
It was a mistake.

446
00:43:55.641 --> 00:43:56.361
Don't do that again.

447
00:44:09.400 --> 00:44:10.024
Get in the car.

448
00:44:54.182 --> 00:44:56.070
I can get you an
upgrade for that for cheap.

449
00:44:56.118 --> 00:44:58.982
5G, better camera.

450
00:45:00.246 --> 00:45:01.158
It's fine.

451
00:45:02.294 --> 00:45:05.125
No, like, I wouldn't make
you pay for it or nothing.

452
00:45:06.725 --> 00:45:07.717
Okay.

453
00:45:09.541 --> 00:45:09.781
Thank you.

454
00:45:16.677 --> 00:45:17.477
I've got a temper, yeah?

455
00:45:19.141 --> 00:45:20.068
Like,

456
00:45:20.116 --> 00:45:26.372
if you shock me, 
I'm going to react.

457
00:45:28.324 --> 00:45:38.324
I get that.

458
00:45:41.732 --> 00:45:42.148
Yeah?

459
00:45:46.019 --> 00:45:46.980
I put you in a--

460
00:45:49.858 --> 00:45:51.891
in a vulnerable position, though.

461
00:45:52.883 --> 00:45:53.699
I should have asked.

462
00:45:56.595 --> 00:45:57.411
It's my fault.

463
00:46:07.137 --> 00:46:07.841
I'm sorry.

464
00:46:18.657 --> 00:46:20.610
Sorry.

465
00:46:34.145 --> 00:46:34.416
Sorry.

466
00:47:46.141 --> 00:47:47.005
- So see you next week?

467
00:47:55.292 --> 00:47:58.491
That was nice.

468
00:48:00.715 --> 00:48:01.675
In the end.

469
00:48:03.980 --> 00:48:06.171
- Yeah?

470
00:48:07.723 --> 00:48:09.116
- Yeah.

471
00:48:12.906 --> 00:48:16.219
- Okay.

472
00:48:17.642 --> 00:48:18.794
Okay, I'll text you.

473
00:48:19.946 --> 00:48:20.618
- Okay.

474
00:48:45.305 --> 00:48:46.265
- What the fuck?

475
00:48:46.985 --> 00:48:47.481
What the fuck?

476
00:48:47.881 --> 00:48:48.233
Turn it off.

477
00:48:49.049 --> 00:48:49.721
Turn it off.

478
00:48:50.170 --> 00:48:50.521
It's off.

479
00:48:54.089 --> 00:49:00.904
- I'm just saying, if
my kids look like that,

480
00:49:00.904 --> 00:49:02.472
I probably wouldn't keep putting them on Instagram.

481
00:49:02.472 --> 00:49:02.729
- Joes.

482
00:49:04.008 --> 00:49:06.856
- Yeah?

483
00:49:07.512 --> 00:49:08.232
- Where you been?

484
00:49:10.551 --> 00:49:10.983
- With a friend?

485
00:49:11.495 --> 00:49:13.720
- She told me you
don't have to lie about it.

486
00:49:13.720 --> 00:49:15.063
I know you're seeing someone.

487
00:49:16.103 --> 00:49:17.991
- I just want
you two to talk again.

488
00:49:18.583 --> 00:49:19.384
- Can we talk about this later?

489
00:49:20.008 --> 00:49:20.502
- No.

490
00:49:22.775 --> 00:49:23.303
Come and sit down.

491
00:49:29.398 --> 00:49:29.830
Come on.

492
00:49:35.862 --> 00:49:36.023
Okay.

493
00:49:41.126 --> 00:49:42.166
- Go on then.

494
00:49:44.533 --> 00:49:46.742
- Can we just be friends again, please?

495
00:49:47.206 --> 00:49:48.789
- I've got type
of yellow ones ignoring me.

496
00:49:48.789 --> 00:49:48.997
- Because...

497
00:49:51.285 --> 00:49:53.333
- Oh, I was very drunk.

498
00:49:53.333 --> 00:49:54.229
I just wanna forget it ever.

499
00:49:54.596 --> 00:49:55.556
- It's already forgotten.

500
00:49:57.333 --> 00:49:58.021
- Good.

501
00:49:58.293 --> 00:49:58.549
- Good.

502
00:50:00.709 --> 00:50:04.165
- Is that it?

503
00:50:12.708 --> 00:50:22.708
- Okay, what is
this energy you've brought in

504
00:50:23.699 --> 00:50:24.211
with you tonight?

505
00:50:24.451 --> 00:50:26.707
- Mm, frustration, confusion,

506
00:50:27.091 --> 00:50:28.452
a sprinkling of self-loathing.

507
00:50:28.866 --> 00:50:30.979
You know, Friday night.

508
00:50:31.459 --> 00:50:32.275
- Spill the tea, bitch.

509
00:50:33.283 --> 00:50:36.146
- Can we just get drunk?

510
00:50:56.578 --> 00:50:58.433
- I guess you summed it up.

511
00:50:59.282 --> 00:51:01.378
It's just... 
- History.

512
00:51:02.466 --> 00:51:05.488
- See, this is why we don't
date people who hate themselves.


513
00:51:05.809 --> 00:51:06.769
- I did not get that memo.

514
00:51:07.137 --> 00:51:08.864
- I mean, not to
be all Oprah about it,

515
00:51:08.864 --> 00:51:10.113
but if there's no emotional connection,

516
00:51:10.305 --> 00:51:11.376
you're just a puckered sphincter

517
00:51:11.376 --> 00:51:12.529
for him to dump his coming to.

518
00:51:15.808 --> 00:51:17.697
- Did I properly say that?

519
00:51:19.344 --> 00:51:20.335
- She texted me this morning.

520
00:51:32.223 --> 00:51:39.214
- So...

521
00:51:50.526 --> 00:51:52.238
Me and Toby

522
00:51:52.238 --> 00:51:57.167
have been talking about your birthday.

523
00:52:01.277 --> 00:52:03.197
Wondering how you wanna
deal with that this year.

524
00:52:03.757 --> 00:52:05.022
- I was saying that this--

525
00:52:05.022 --> 00:52:05.198
- No.

526
00:52:05.198 --> 00:52:05.934
- Sorry, sorry.

527
00:52:09.918 --> 00:52:12.877
- No, obviously there's no pressure from us.

528
00:52:13.309 --> 00:52:13.678
It can be,

529
00:52:13.693 --> 00:52:19.725
it can be whatever
you want it to be.

530
00:52:22.989 --> 00:52:23.436
- Hmm.

531
00:52:26.861 --> 00:52:30.347
I think I wanna get back on stage.

532
00:52:33.948 --> 00:52:36.412
- Yeah?

533
00:52:37.484 --> 00:52:39.244
- Yeah.

534
00:52:42.492 --> 00:52:42.684
- Yeah.

535
00:52:44.588 --> 00:52:45.819
- Fucking miss her.

536
00:52:47.242 --> 00:52:47.883
- And for daddy.

537
00:52:48.203 --> 00:52:48.699
- Yes.

538
00:52:49.868 --> 00:52:51.227
- I miss her too.

539
00:52:52.666 --> 00:52:54.507
- No, no, she was just so,

540
00:52:55.179 --> 00:52:58.507
she was so powerful.

541
00:53:01.210 --> 00:53:02.842
It's not that it's confusing.

542
00:53:03.082 --> 00:53:03.306
It was like,

543
00:53:05.674 --> 00:53:08.715
it was like, like she
was the real me and,

544
00:53:10.714 --> 00:53:12.266
and I was the performance.

545
00:53:16.329 --> 00:53:18.938
I laughed at it.

546
00:53:20.825 --> 00:53:21.353
After, you know.

547
00:53:26.089 --> 00:53:28.424
It was like I wasn't,

548
00:53:31.720 --> 00:53:33.096
it's like I wasn't worth that anymore.

549
00:53:37.976 --> 00:53:38.792
- I could let her down.

550
00:53:40.361 --> 00:53:42.824
- You didn't let anyone down, babe.

551
00:53:45.384 --> 00:53:46.664
- So,

552
00:53:47.560 --> 00:53:51.175
should we be preparing for a comeback tour?

553
00:53:51.559 --> 00:53:51.751
- Oh.

554
00:53:52.536 --> 00:53:53.816
- Kyoko shows comes up.

555
00:54:30.293 --> 00:54:31.013
- You mate, you mate.

556
00:54:31.397 --> 00:54:32.902
- Get the girls
in, get the girls in.

557
00:54:33.094 --> 00:54:34.133
- Come on, who's your manners?

558
00:54:34.502 --> 00:54:35.269
- Yeah, that's you, Bish.

559
00:54:35.461 --> 00:54:37.445
- Get the next one.

560
00:54:38.134 --> 00:54:39.460
- The chivalry goes a long way.

561
00:54:40.516 --> 00:54:41.012
- You're a joke.

562
00:54:41.492 --> 00:54:42.596
- You're a joke, huh?

563
00:54:43.028 --> 00:54:44.068
She finds me funny.

564
00:54:44.068 --> 00:54:44.596
- You're a Bish.

565
00:54:45.381 --> 00:54:46.708
- Oh, Preston's little mate.

566
00:54:49.029 --> 00:54:51.477
What was the name again?

567
00:54:52.164 --> 00:54:52.452
- Jules.

568
00:54:52.724 --> 00:54:54.180
- I think I Preston said
he was too tired to come home.

569
00:54:54.468 --> 00:54:54.788
- Christian.

570
00:54:56.324 --> 00:54:58.179
- What are you doing there, Jules?

571
00:54:59.299 --> 00:55:01.124
- I'm just here
to pick up on that.

572
00:55:02.308 --> 00:55:03.459
You know, he gets
all this shit from me.

573
00:55:03.811 --> 00:55:04.627
- Don't be ripping him off.

574
00:55:07.060 --> 00:55:12.259
- Hey, hey.

575
00:55:13.107 --> 00:55:14.355
- Hey, naked, guys.

576
00:55:14.627 --> 00:55:17.251
- Hey, hey, Preston, man,
put some fucking clothes on.

577
00:55:17.251 --> 00:55:17.763
- Hey, come on, man.

578
00:55:17.763 --> 00:55:18.483
- We've got company.

579
00:55:19.587 --> 00:55:21.379
I swear he's trying to seduce you, Jules.

580
00:55:21.746 --> 00:55:22.722
- Preston, you got the cold ones.

581
00:55:22.722 --> 00:55:22.946
- I know.

582
00:55:23.266 --> 00:55:24.818
- I done, 40 of
you lot was going loose.

583
00:55:24.818 --> 00:55:26.370
- Ah, Debs do a hissy, man.

584
00:55:26.370 --> 00:55:27.298
- Fucking psycho, man.

585
00:55:27.697 --> 00:55:31.969
- Jules, man, put some
clothes on and we can get out of here.


586
00:55:31.969 --> 00:55:33.090
- Wait, wait, please don't leave me.

587
00:55:33.538 --> 00:55:34.338
Don't follow me.

588
00:55:36.194 --> 00:55:36.641
Relax.

589
00:55:36.882 --> 00:55:37.089
- Well done.

590
00:55:37.488 --> 00:55:37.680
- Yo.

591
00:55:38.129 --> 00:55:38.513
- Put that back.

592
00:55:39.025 --> 00:55:39.953
- Ah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

593
00:55:41.041 --> 00:55:43.105
- Jules.

594
00:55:46.177 --> 00:55:46.577
Jules!

595
00:55:47.713 --> 00:55:54.736
- Bro, I still
have no clothes in, man.

596
00:55:55.056 --> 00:55:55.408
Bring it here.

597
00:55:55.616 --> 00:55:57.040
- You get nicked, you get nicked.

598
00:55:57.040 --> 00:55:57.792
You get nicked, Jules.

599
00:55:58.080 --> 00:55:58.577
What you be talking about?

600
00:55:58.577 --> 00:55:59.745
- How many are
in church to meet, man?

601
00:55:59.745 --> 00:56:00.784
- You know, we're
just about to come out.

602
00:56:00.784 --> 00:56:02.736
- No, you lot, this
guy was in Pentonville with Preston

603
00:56:02.736 --> 00:56:04.448
and he's looking at
me like I'm the crook.

604
00:56:05.120 --> 00:56:06.831
Are you coming into my house
and being rude to me, Jules?

605
00:56:07.503 --> 00:56:07.887
- I'm not.

606
00:56:09.311 --> 00:56:11.440
- Then come and sit down, man.

607
00:56:14.207 --> 00:56:23.438
- You know what, though,
yeah, if you wanted weed,

608
00:56:23.470 --> 00:56:24.879
you should have come straight to the source.

609
00:56:26.463 --> 00:56:28.175
Would have given you a much better deal.

610
00:56:28.559 --> 00:56:29.582
- Come on, it's all right, man.

611
00:56:29.822 --> 00:56:30.655
Just for sleep, 
I've got enough.

612
00:56:31.231 --> 00:56:33.519
- How much money have
you got on you now?

613
00:56:33.743 --> 00:56:35.757
- Of course, man, that's Preston's meat, bro.

614
00:56:36.429 --> 00:56:38.062
- Hush your gums, man, that ain't scary.

615
00:56:39.775 --> 00:56:40.734
Ain't gonna drop the soap.

616
00:56:40.734 --> 00:56:41.582
- Allow it, man.

617
00:56:42.365 --> 00:56:44.094
- What was you inside for?

618
00:56:44.766 --> 00:56:45.151
- What?

619
00:56:46.125 --> 00:56:46.782
- Prison.

620
00:56:48.286 --> 00:56:48.637
- Oh.

621
00:56:50.253 --> 00:56:51.836
- Stay then.

622
00:56:54.845 --> 00:56:57.182
- You want a few
more seconds to think about that?

623
00:56:57.182 --> 00:56:58.684
- No, no, no, I just don't
want to talk about it, do I?

624
00:56:59.821 --> 00:57:02.622
- I'm not gonna lie, 
Jules, you don't look like the type.

625
00:57:05.532 --> 00:57:07.676
- Oh, shit, you got Streetfire on.

626
00:57:08.317 --> 00:57:09.900
- Are you a gamer, Jules?

627
00:57:10.284 --> 00:57:11.052
- Oh, yeah, I bet.

628
00:57:11.052 --> 00:57:13.549
- Well, I'm actually top
10 in the world at Streetfire.

629
00:57:14.173 --> 00:57:15.195
- Oh, gee.

630
00:57:15.195 --> 00:57:16.028
- Top 10 in the room, then.

631
00:57:17.595 --> 00:57:19.836
- Top 10 in this room at Streetfire.

632
00:57:21.707 --> 00:57:22.219
- Oh, give me that.

633
00:57:22.955 --> 00:57:23.436
- You want to play?

634
00:57:23.628 --> 00:57:23.835
- Yeah.

635
00:57:24.700 --> 00:57:25.563
- I'll be each gamer's seats.

636
00:57:26.171 --> 00:57:26.459
- Jack.

637
00:57:26.651 --> 00:57:27.691
- Loud Jules, man, he's a guest.

638
00:57:28.443 --> 00:57:29.883
- Yeah, don't be sad
that Jules, that's my character.

639
00:57:30.187 --> 00:57:31.435
- Have you seen a
second, it comes with a lion?

640
00:57:32.314 --> 00:57:33.066
- A lion, yeah.

641
00:57:33.531 --> 00:57:34.602
- Comes with a lion as well.

642
00:57:34.602 --> 00:57:34.971
- There you go.

643
00:57:35.195 --> 00:57:36.107
- What are you laughing about, man?

644
00:57:36.667 --> 00:57:37.546
- I'm fucking laughing, man.

645
00:57:37.546 --> 00:57:38.730
- It's a fucking tiger, bro.

646
00:57:39.579 --> 00:57:40.523
- Now, let's begin.

647
00:57:40.763 --> 00:57:42.523
- Oh, Jules gonna be Chun
-Li.

648
00:57:45.706 --> 00:57:47.434
- You know, she's a buff cartoon, innit?

649
00:57:47.434 --> 00:57:48.106
- She is.

650
00:57:48.970 --> 00:57:50.698
Jules, Chun
-Li will get it, you know.

651
00:57:51.370 --> 00:57:51.978
Fuck, you know.

652
00:57:51.978 --> 00:57:52.506
- Come on, Jack.

653
00:57:52.506 --> 00:57:54.921
- If her thighs are that big, 
I imagine the bunder.

654
00:57:54.921 --> 00:57:55.385
- Sizemaker.

655
00:57:56.362 --> 00:57:58.874
- Mmm, just straight in, yeah?

656
00:57:59.162 --> 00:58:00.472
- Oh, that arse.

657
00:58:00.825 --> 00:58:01.560
- Fuck, you know.

658
00:58:02.809 --> 00:58:03.672
- You know, you can have a lay-on-up.

659
00:58:03.672 --> 00:58:05.961
- I'm running, bro, 
I'm slapping in here as well.

660
00:58:06.201 --> 00:58:06.904
- You're dead, bro.

661
00:58:08.345 --> 00:58:09.801
- I've actually fatted before.

662
00:58:11.770 --> 00:58:13.177
- Just play the game, man.

663
00:58:16.072 --> 00:58:18.231
- You just got perfected by a girl.

664
00:58:20.648 --> 00:58:25.064
- He's honestly always
talking about he's the best.

665
00:58:25.464 --> 00:58:26.520
- Look at this guy now.

666
00:58:28.024 --> 00:58:30.647
- Restored, man, you'll make
some fucking savage at this, man.


667
00:58:32.936 --> 00:58:34.967
- You're flirting, you say,
"Move over and over again."

668
00:58:41.031 --> 00:58:42.919
- You guys are so loud.

669
00:58:43.591 --> 00:58:44.150
- You're cheap, Ola.

670
00:58:44.150 --> 00:58:44.663
- Come on, Don.

671
00:58:44.774 --> 00:58:45.703
- You're bringing Trillia again, yeah?

672
00:58:45.703 --> 00:58:45.910
- Yeah.

673
00:58:46.550 --> 00:58:48.023
- You know who
it's going to be, innit?

674
00:58:48.023 --> 00:58:48.503
- There you go.

675
00:58:48.887 --> 00:58:49.943
- I love you, so serious?

676
00:58:51.751 --> 00:58:52.262
- Come on, Don.

677
00:58:52.262 --> 00:58:53.270
- How come you play, innit?

678
00:58:53.462 --> 00:58:55.094
- Look at Don playing with two fingers

679
00:58:55.094 --> 00:58:56.278
like he's playing a fucking piano.

680
00:58:58.885 --> 00:58:59.862
- That's how you make the change,

681
00:59:00.214 --> 00:59:00.901
you make the whole game, man.

682
00:59:00.901 --> 00:59:01.878
- Oh, fuck, you're dead.

683
00:59:02.166 --> 00:59:02.774
- You're dead.

684
00:59:04.342 --> 00:59:05.190
- I know.

685
00:59:10.693 --> 00:59:11.861
- All right, fuck off, man.

686
00:59:12.389 --> 00:59:13.957
- You know your play is repacko.

687
00:59:13.957 --> 00:59:14.629
- Yeah, I'm fucked.

688
00:59:14.629 --> 00:59:15.268
- Like, you realize.

689
00:59:16.212 --> 00:59:16.500
- Right.

690
00:59:18.773 --> 00:59:20.293
- You make it stay standing, fuck.

691
00:59:20.405 --> 00:59:20.772
Stay standing.

692
00:59:23.557 --> 00:59:24.517
- Damn, I'm half-taught.

693
00:59:24.773 --> 00:59:26.260
- You made it, you're long.

694
00:59:26.483 --> 00:59:27.380
- I'm a little bit sick.

695
00:59:27.380 --> 00:59:28.740
- You got two, you got two.

696
00:59:28.740 --> 00:59:29.107
- You got two.

697
00:59:29.107 --> 00:59:30.836
- The problem with the
controller is you're holding it.

698
00:59:30.836 --> 00:59:31.892
- Try and get off the fucking wall.

699
00:59:31.892 --> 00:59:32.291
- That's all.

700
00:59:32.291 --> 00:59:32.723
- You're gonna grab again.

701
00:59:33.044 --> 00:59:33.700
- Trust me.

702
00:59:33.988 --> 00:59:34.772
Try, do it again.

703
00:59:35.220 --> 00:59:36.436
- You're gonna have to keep passing.

704
00:59:37.013 --> 00:59:38.147
- How does this just get bloodlust?

705
00:59:38.164 --> 00:59:39.748
Oh, no, uh-oh.

706
00:59:39.748 --> 00:59:41.379
- Don't fucking throw
my stuff on the ground,

707
00:59:41.379 --> 00:59:42.035
I swear down.

708
00:59:42.692 --> 00:59:44.371
Someone pass me the fucking thing, man.

709
00:59:45.043 --> 00:59:45.683
- Bad disrespect, man.

710
00:59:45.683 --> 00:59:46.595
- I'm joking, man.

711
00:59:46.899 --> 00:59:47.668
- Fuck off, man.

712
00:59:48.419 --> 00:59:49.299
- You're not holding the wall.

713
00:59:49.299 --> 00:59:50.323
- You're doing this for the Jews, fuck.

714
00:59:50.643 --> 00:59:51.219
- Fuck this.

715
00:59:54.564 --> 00:59:57.170
- Shut up, shut up, you fucking bloke.

716
00:59:58.194 --> 00:59:58.738
- What do you mean?

717
00:59:59.235 --> 01:00:00.179
- I see you losing.

718
01:00:01.250 --> 01:00:02.530
- Preston, you're on my face, man.

719
01:00:02.578 --> 01:00:03.795
He's coming now, he's getting hurt.

720
01:00:04.339 --> 01:00:04.995
- Where's the ball?

721
01:00:05.523 --> 01:00:07.891
- You're gonna have to get
it out of my fucking face, man.

722
01:00:10.770 --> 01:00:12.529
- I'm gonna win, 
I'm gonna win it.

723
01:00:12.529 --> 01:00:13.297
I'll be there, 
I'll be there.

724
01:00:13.458 --> 01:00:15.378
I'm gonna win, 
I'm gonna win.

725
01:00:17.809 --> 01:00:18.465
- Oh, man.

726
01:00:18.801 --> 01:00:19.377
- Fuck off, man.

727
01:00:19.761 --> 01:00:20.945
- This guy's trying to cheat.

728
01:00:20.945 --> 01:00:22.066
- It was so close, though.

729
01:00:22.066 --> 01:00:23.186
- This guy's fucking cheating.

730
01:00:23.473 --> 01:00:24.112
- What's in this shit?

731
01:00:24.656 --> 01:00:26.144
- I told you this guy was crazy.

732
01:00:41.391 --> 01:00:43.248
- Like, see me fucking meet up?

733
01:00:44.672 --> 01:00:45.152
- Kinda, yeah.

734
01:00:47.359 --> 01:00:50.640
We can get out of
there now if you want.

735
01:00:52.415 --> 01:00:54.991
- We could go fucking around.

736
01:00:57.439 --> 01:00:58.079
- No, mate.

737
01:01:00.143 --> 01:01:01.663
- Jules, grab me a beer, man.

738
01:01:01.951 --> 01:01:02.623
- There's none left.

739
01:01:02.928 --> 01:01:04.223
- Fucking Preston, man.

740
01:01:04.223 --> 01:01:05.791
Buy your own fucking beers, man.

741
01:01:05.791 --> 01:01:06.639
- First one I've had.

742
01:01:06.639 --> 01:01:08.495
- Keep driving around in your uncle's BMW.

743
01:01:08.831 --> 01:01:09.838
- Mate, why you being a dickhead?

744
01:01:11.166 --> 01:01:12.142
- So you're a scrounger?

745
01:01:13.086 --> 01:01:14.030
Come on, you man.

746
01:01:14.030 --> 01:01:15.214
- Hey, my uncle,
shall I put it off?

747
01:01:16.126 --> 01:01:16.846
- Are you trying to impress?

748
01:01:17.086 --> 01:01:17.775
- We're going out.

749
01:01:18.078 --> 01:01:19.230
I ain't staying in no dry house.

750
01:01:19.518 --> 01:01:20.846
- Focus on the game,
you focus on the game.

751
01:01:20.846 --> 01:01:22.029
- Jules, you coming?

752
01:01:23.037 --> 01:01:24.478
- We can't, we got shit to do.

753
01:01:25.054 --> 01:01:26.062
- What, is that chatting to you?

754
01:01:26.685 --> 01:01:27.885
Do whatever the fuck you want, man.

755
01:01:29.710 --> 01:01:29.998
- Jules.

756
01:01:31.598 --> 01:01:32.861
- Yeah.

757
01:01:34.990 --> 01:01:35.340
You all right?

758
01:01:36.493 --> 01:01:37.581
- Come on, you lot.

759
01:01:37.581 --> 01:01:38.092
- What are you doing?

760
01:01:38.620 --> 01:01:38.860
- I'm done.

761
01:01:40.012 --> 01:01:41.068
- I'm just keeping it interesting.

762
01:01:41.853 --> 01:01:42.733
- Hey, Lydian, come in, yes?

763
01:01:43.245 --> 01:01:43.516
- Check.

764
01:01:48.429 --> 01:01:50.763
- Yeah, that's Jules, yeah?

765
01:01:51.003 --> 01:01:51.243
- Yeah, he's doing it.

766
01:01:51.884 --> 01:01:52.844
- All right, let's go, some shots.

767
01:01:53.773 --> 01:01:54.540
- Yeah, yeah, shots.

768
01:01:55.227 --> 01:01:55.724
- You got him, then?

769
01:01:55.724 --> 01:01:56.747
- Yeah, come on, then.

770
01:01:56.747 --> 01:01:57.292
- Come on, come.

771
01:02:16.491 --> 01:02:21.674
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

772
01:02:23.131 --> 01:02:23.625
- Oh, oh.

773
01:02:23.930 --> 01:02:24.842
- Oh.

774
01:02:25.194 --> 01:02:25.866
- Oh, I feel it.

775
01:02:26.298 --> 01:02:27.002
- Yeah, yeah.

776
01:02:28.394 --> 01:02:30.730
- Yell him in shirts, and watch.

777
01:02:30.730 --> 01:02:31.370
Did you see the back?

778
01:02:31.786 --> 01:02:32.618
- I feel it.

779
01:02:33.417 --> 01:02:34.170
- She's got a husband.

780
01:02:35.657 --> 01:02:36.377
- Oh, nice.

781
01:02:36.841 --> 01:02:37.834
- Yes, I hear it.

782
01:02:39.370 --> 01:02:40.394
What a waste, man.

783
01:02:40.937 --> 01:02:41.417
Watch, watch, watch.

784
01:02:43.578 --> 01:02:45.210
- Why are you so harsh, then?

785
01:02:45.210 --> 01:02:46.185
- It's like banter, innit?

786
01:02:48.201 --> 01:02:51.289
The trick is, you wanna
push him right to his edge,

787
01:02:52.120 --> 01:02:53.112
and then just walk away.

788
01:02:54.249 --> 01:02:56.089
And the next time
someone looks at him sideways,

789
01:02:56.329 --> 01:02:57.609
he goes full-on psycho.

790
01:02:59.993 --> 01:03:01.241
- Is it bad?

791
01:03:01.896 --> 01:03:03.000
- Yeah, you never see that, no?

792
01:03:03.176 --> 01:03:03.943
- No, no.

793
01:03:05.032 --> 01:03:06.328
- My man's like a pit bull

794
01:03:06.328 --> 01:03:08.104
that's been dropped on
his head too many times.

795
01:03:08.808 --> 01:03:09.831
He's kinda funny still.

796
01:03:11.623 --> 01:03:13.833
Not for the person who's
getting chunks torn out of him, no?


797
01:03:15.448 --> 01:03:16.231
- Sounds fucked.

798
01:03:16.695 --> 01:03:17.351
- Bro, sweetie.

799
01:03:18.215 --> 01:03:19.559
- Yeah, bruv, I swear to God,

800
01:03:19.607 --> 01:03:21.351
imagine that mid-year, this pub here,

801
01:03:21.831 --> 01:03:23.127

802
01:03:23.127 --> 01:03:24.551
just we chatting, 
I know I'm in it from the gym,

803
01:03:24.551 --> 01:03:25.095
but just chatting.

804
01:03:25.095 --> 01:03:26.055
- Are you chatting to
the guys in the gym?

805
01:03:26.183 --> 01:03:28.695
- Man, he kept,
listen, bruv, he kept that.

806
01:03:29.079 --> 01:03:30.518
That's not me, bruv, that's not me.

807
01:03:30.518 --> 01:03:31.222
That's got me in the pub.

808
01:03:31.462 --> 01:03:32.037
- Okay, okay.

809
01:03:32.037 --> 01:03:33.110
- He's in the gym, bro.

810
01:03:33.110 --> 01:03:33.782
We up, dude.

811
01:03:35.126 --> 01:03:36.871
- But anyways, 
I'm chatting to him here,

812
01:03:36.871 --> 01:03:38.342
and there's this one
girl that we chatting to

813
01:03:38.342 --> 01:03:39.046
for a couple weeks here.

814
01:03:39.734 --> 01:03:41.158
He's the only beautiful friend here.

815
01:03:41.702 --> 01:03:42.183
I'm like--

816
01:03:42.183 --> 01:03:43.239
- He chatted to him on his side.

817
01:03:43.239 --> 01:03:43.862
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

818
01:03:43.862 --> 01:03:44.581
I'm like, you know this girl?

819
01:03:45.013 --> 01:03:45.813
I'm tapping into this girl.

820
01:03:46.053 --> 01:03:47.798
You know this girl, man, 
I swear to God,

821
01:03:47.798 --> 01:03:49.125
man goes at it, 
I'll say that, man goes,

822
01:03:49.333 --> 01:03:51.333
show it to him, 
I'm like, bruv, you know who this girl is?

823
01:03:51.909 --> 01:03:53.222
I swear to God, the guy goes,

824
01:03:53.798 --> 01:03:54.790
bruv, he goes, that's my girl.

825
01:03:57.798 --> 01:03:59.812
- I got me a dickhead.

826
01:04:02.212 --> 01:04:05.060
- I swear to God, bruv, 
I swear to God,

827
01:04:05.572 --> 01:04:06.884
I'll always love bruv myself.

828
01:04:06.884 --> 01:04:07.877
Pudge you anyway, bruv.

829
01:04:07.877 --> 01:04:08.756
But whose round is it?

830
01:04:09.125 --> 01:04:09.956
- Not mine, man.

831
01:04:09.956 --> 01:04:10.196
- What?

832
01:04:10.453 --> 01:04:11.125
Whose round is it?

833
01:04:12.100 --> 01:04:12.420
- Chris.

834
01:04:13.411 --> 01:04:14.628
- I'm like, any trick question, bruv.

835
01:04:14.628 --> 01:04:15.379
Who's round is it?

836
01:04:15.523 --> 01:04:15.748
- Yeah.

837
01:04:16.500 --> 01:04:17.220
- What you up?

838
01:04:17.508 --> 01:04:18.148
- Yeah, go, yeah, go.

839
01:04:18.563 --> 01:04:19.204
- Yeah, go.

840
01:04:19.411 --> 01:04:19.812
- Joss?

841
01:04:20.356 --> 01:04:20.628
- Chris.

842
01:04:21.012 --> 01:04:21.956
- Can I dance with me?

843
01:04:22.740 --> 01:04:23.172
- What?

844
01:04:23.651 --> 01:04:24.691
- Can I dance with me?

845
01:04:24.931 --> 01:04:26.227
- What happened to me, Lydia?

846
01:04:27.044 --> 01:04:27.539
- Yeah, yeah.

847
01:04:28.499 --> 01:04:28.691
Yeah.

848
01:04:29.314 --> 01:04:29.778
- All right, Joss.

849
01:04:30.018 --> 01:04:30.930
- What, Lydia, you moved quick.

850
01:04:30.930 --> 01:04:31.395
- What, Joss?

851
01:04:31.395 --> 01:04:32.067
- That's a flop.

852
01:04:32.371 --> 01:04:32.659
- Yeah.

853
01:04:33.683 --> 01:04:34.099
- Nice.

854
01:04:34.962 --> 01:04:35.058
- Yeah.

855
01:04:35.058 --> 01:04:35.795
- You're doing pretty good.

856
01:04:36.018 --> 01:04:36.402
- Press it, man.

857
01:04:36.402 --> 01:04:37.026
- Come on, man.

858
01:04:37.123 --> 01:04:37.475
- You're the dude, bruv.

- We need this to cool off.

866
01:05:42.703 --> 01:05:43.487
- Getting some air.

867
01:05:44.510 --> 01:05:45.614
I was just pissing me off.

868
01:05:46.366 --> 01:05:47.583
- This is a fucking dickhead.

869
01:05:48.864 --> 01:05:49.502
- Cut it, love.

870
01:05:50.671 --> 01:05:51.247
- All right.

871
01:05:57.198 --> 01:05:59.534
- What's this act you're doing?

872
01:06:00.414 --> 01:06:01.021
- You like it.

873
01:06:05.486 --> 01:06:06.158
- Not the ending you want.

874
01:06:09.677 --> 01:06:10.621
Yeah.

875
01:06:11.613 --> 01:06:13.149
I'm not your type.

876
01:06:14.365 --> 01:06:14.813
- Yeah.

877
01:06:18.317 --> 01:06:20.525
- You ain't a big man
to treat you like a little bitch.

878
01:06:25.036 --> 01:06:25.932
- Maybe.

879
01:06:30.796 --> 01:06:32.460
- Come on then.

880
01:06:33.981 --> 01:06:35.020
Let's go.

881
01:06:40.923 --> 01:06:41.499
And you do what I say.

882
01:06:43.883 --> 01:06:45.340
- Yeah.

883
01:06:47.115 --> 01:06:47.979
- Good boy.

884
01:07:07.274 --> 01:07:08.506
- Upstairs.

885
01:07:11.498 --> 01:07:13.450
Take your fucking shoes off.

886
01:07:50.471 --> 01:07:51.607
- What are you doing?

887
01:07:53.671 --> 01:07:54.648
Take your clothes off.

888
01:07:57.191 --> 01:07:59.896
You know what I mean?

889
01:08:01.639 --> 01:08:03.126
When you're out there with your little friends,

890
01:08:04.422 --> 01:08:05.815
pretending to be some big man of thot,

891
01:08:07.863 --> 01:08:09.095
I want to remind her

892
01:08:10.439 --> 01:08:10.967
that really,

893
01:08:16.951 --> 01:08:17.957
you're just my little slut.

894
01:08:24.069 --> 01:08:25.414
- Are we gonna do what I say?

895
01:08:54.356 --> 01:09:04.356
- What's this?

896
01:09:12.547 --> 01:09:13.604
We're going to a fight.

897
01:09:15.921 --> 01:09:17.267
- Give me a name.

898
01:09:18.146 --> 01:09:19.394
I'll fuck them up.

899
01:10:53.821 --> 01:10:55.837
- Ah, they're mixing all of us actually.

900
01:10:56.109 --> 01:10:57.181
They're kind of just picking trees.

901
01:10:57.869 --> 01:10:58.061
- No.

902
01:10:59.660 --> 01:11:01.613
- Toni.

903
01:11:01.885 --> 01:11:03.037
- It's a syring stress.

904
01:11:03.534 --> 01:11:04.364
- Right, right.

905
01:11:04.876 --> 01:11:05.324
Nice.

906
01:11:05.324 --> 01:11:06.669
- I asked him what to do.

907
01:11:07.069 --> 01:11:07.261
Telling.

908
01:11:07.693 --> 01:11:08.749
Morning, Wrecked.

909
01:11:09.181 --> 01:11:10.459
- You want some food?

910
01:11:11.212 --> 01:11:12.060
- Wow.

911
01:11:13.980 --> 01:11:14.780
It's quite extravagant.

912
01:11:15.053 --> 01:11:15.708
- Oh, Julius.

913
01:11:16.204 --> 01:11:17.132
Then you have guests.

914
01:11:18.380 --> 01:11:19.565
- They're keeping you against your will.

915
01:11:20.700 --> 01:11:21.883
- That's fine.

916
01:11:21.883 --> 01:11:22.604
It's food, innit?

917
01:11:23.771 --> 01:11:24.940
- We hear it was a big night.

918
01:11:26.268 --> 01:11:27.146
- Yeah, I got a little,

919
01:11:28.379 --> 01:11:29.179
a little heavy.

920
01:11:29.515 --> 01:11:30.155
He was on one.

921
01:11:31.403 --> 01:11:31.788
- Hmm.

922
01:11:32.267 --> 01:11:33.131
Hair at the dog then?

923
01:11:35.099 --> 01:11:38.762
- Preston was just
telling us about his business.

924
01:11:38.986 --> 01:11:40.650
- It's just a
market stall at the moment.

925
01:11:41.002 --> 01:11:42.794
I'm saving up some capital to expand.

926
01:11:43.211 --> 01:11:44.330
- And what kind of clothes is it?

927
01:11:44.842 --> 01:11:46.506
- Like street wear, skate wear.

928
01:11:47.274 --> 01:11:49.674
Like Stussy or Supreme, but not...

929
01:11:51.018 --> 01:11:54.137
I'm trying to make some
connections with smaller European labels.


930
01:11:54.522 --> 01:11:55.737
Help them establish over here.

931
01:11:56.313 --> 01:11:56.618
- Cool.

932
01:11:57.033 --> 01:11:59.513
- So you're the
inspiration behind Julius' new dressings?

933
01:12:01.017 --> 01:12:03.802
- Uh, nah, I think that's all them.

934
01:12:04.361 --> 01:12:04.618
- Hmm.

935
01:12:06.090 --> 01:12:07.432
- He's got good style though.

936
01:12:29.559 --> 01:12:31.943
- Hiya.

937
01:12:40.375 --> 01:12:41.671
I just wanted to say,

938
01:12:43.207 --> 01:12:46.087
sorry if I've been a bit standoffish.

939
01:12:47.495 --> 01:12:49.095
Julius is my best friend. 
I'm protective.

940
01:12:52.854 --> 01:12:54.118
It's been rough lately.

941
01:12:55.367 --> 01:12:58.165
Don't know if he told
you about the, um, the attack.

942
01:12:59.109 --> 01:12:59.686
- The scar on his head?

943
01:13:00.246 --> 01:13:00.534
- Hmm.

944
01:13:01.206 --> 01:13:04.837
Hasn't really felt like
the real jewels since then.

945
01:13:06.677 --> 01:13:11.125
All this, the clothes, the posturing,

946
01:13:12.325 --> 01:13:12.966
I just worry.

947
01:13:18.102 --> 01:13:20.053
We're planning a birthday thing for him.

948
01:13:20.980 --> 01:13:21.652
You should come.

949
01:13:23.573 --> 01:13:24.677
- Yeah?

950
01:13:25.125 --> 01:13:27.348
- I don't know if you're
asking me, probably be embarrassed,


951
01:13:27.588 --> 01:13:30.853
but if he sort of
just showed up as a surprise,

952
01:13:31.573 --> 01:13:32.915
I think he'd be really touched.

953
01:13:34.564 --> 01:13:36.756
And it'd be good for you to
see him in his natural environment.


954
01:13:38.147 --> 01:13:39.827
- Maybe. See what I'm doing.

955
01:13:40.852 --> 01:13:43.923
- Give me your number. 
I'll text you the details.

956
01:13:53.331 --> 01:13:55.666
- Right.

957
01:13:57.891 --> 01:14:01.155
Last night, I was kind of mad.

958
01:14:01.922 --> 01:14:02.145
- Yeah.

959
01:14:03.650 --> 01:14:05.810
- I'll text you.

960
01:14:58.607 --> 01:14:59.310
- Fuck.

961
01:16:23.882 --> 01:16:33.882
- Come on.

962
01:16:37.482 --> 01:16:39.002
- She's here!

963
01:16:42.281 --> 01:16:42.713
- Come here!

964
01:16:43.241 --> 01:16:44.665
- Happy birthday!

965
01:16:46.537 --> 01:16:47.849
- Welcome home!

966
01:16:49.017 --> 01:16:49.369
- Oh, my God.

967
01:17:53.349 --> 01:18:00.885
- All right. Can
I get a bit, please?

968
01:18:07.716 --> 01:18:09.204
- What are you looking for?

969
01:18:15.396 --> 01:18:16.484
What is he doing here?

970
01:18:16.948 --> 01:18:18.068
- I invited him.

971
01:18:18.068 --> 01:18:18.836
- Does Jules know?

972
01:18:19.124 --> 01:18:19.796
- It's a surprise.

973
01:18:21.235 --> 01:18:21.460
- Toby.

974
01:18:22.036 --> 01:18:22.644
- What? Is this birthday?

975
01:18:22.644 --> 01:18:24.563
- I can't see what
they're trying to do here.

976
01:18:24.563 --> 01:18:24.899
- All right.

977
01:18:25.683 --> 01:18:26.227
- Hey!

978
01:18:28.243 --> 01:18:29.715
So nice of you to come.

979
01:18:30.755 --> 01:18:32.419
- I can't stay long. 
I've got another thing, but

980
01:18:32.675 --> 01:18:34.483
I'd have one. Say happy birthday.

981
01:18:35.698 --> 01:18:36.819
- Do you want me
to put that in my bag?

982
01:18:37.650 --> 01:18:37.986
- Jules.

983
01:18:40.355 --> 01:18:41.041
Where is he at?

984
01:18:41.778 --> 01:18:42.114
- Um...

985
01:18:43.379 --> 01:18:44.339
I'll be on stage in a minute.

986
01:18:45.187 --> 01:18:45.635
- On stage?

987
01:18:46.691 --> 01:18:51.186
- Welcome back, my children, to Salasir!

988
01:18:55.714 --> 01:18:56.914
- And...

989
01:18:57.330 --> 01:18:57.954
Shut the fuck up.

990
01:18:59.169 --> 01:19:01.618
Our next act left us for the summer

991
01:19:01.618 --> 01:19:05.776
to go and sip
the cocktails in the Hamptons.

992
01:19:07.409 --> 01:19:10.897
But now...

993
01:19:13.233 --> 01:19:14.001
she's back.

994
01:19:15.409 --> 01:19:17.824
And if you thought that
she was a bad bitch before,

995
01:19:18.128 --> 01:19:19.440
let me tell you...

996
01:19:20.032 --> 01:19:22.512
you are going to gag!

997
01:19:23.296 --> 01:19:25.456
So please, give a large hand

998
01:19:25.489 --> 01:19:30.608
and raise the roof for
my friend as a queen

999
01:19:30.608 --> 01:19:35.247
as a fucking south effra-dighty man!

1000
01:19:41.983 --> 01:19:49.998
- Hold up! Hold up!

1001
01:19:50.254 --> 01:19:50.462
Yes!

1002
01:19:51.407 --> 01:19:52.078
Yes!

1003
01:19:52.350 --> 01:19:53.887
Yes, I said, I said!

1004
01:19:54.127 --> 01:19:55.806
Yes, it's been a minute, bros.

1005
01:19:55.806 --> 01:19:56.942
What you sayin'?

1006
01:19:57.246 --> 01:19:59.182
She is broad!

1007
01:20:01.341 --> 01:20:04.525
So they say you should
always lead with a joke.

1008
01:20:04.525 --> 01:20:05.901
So I'm just going to jump right in

1009
01:20:05.901 --> 01:20:08.429
with a story about my gay bastard.

1010
01:20:09.646 --> 01:20:10.221
No, no, no, no.

1011
01:20:10.221 --> 01:20:10.766
Don't panic.

1012
01:20:11.006 --> 01:20:11.646
Don't panic.

1013
01:20:12.141 --> 01:20:16.189
It all ends with us making
a very steamy sex tape together.

1014
01:20:16.909 --> 01:20:18.252
No, no, no, no, no, no.

1015
01:20:18.285 --> 01:20:20.237
I know we've all seen that poem before,

1016
01:20:20.573 --> 01:20:27.805
but trust me, this guy
is a very special performer.

1017
01:22:00.088 --> 01:22:01.175
- Happy birthday. 
- Fuck!

1018
01:22:01.943 --> 01:22:02.214
Fuck.

1019
01:22:05.143 --> 01:22:09.670
What are you doing here?

1020
01:22:11.543 --> 01:22:12.917
- Your mate invited me.

1021
01:22:13.174 --> 01:22:13.830
Surprised you.

1022
01:22:15.718 --> 01:22:21.958
- I'm not supposed to come.

1023
01:22:42.100 --> 01:22:43.012
If you're caught, 
I'll remember you.

1024
01:22:51.861 --> 01:22:52.341
What?

1025
01:22:58.579 --> 01:23:00.116
I don't know what you mean.

1026
01:23:02.420 --> 01:23:02.980
Don't you?

1027
01:23:03.588 --> 01:23:05.204
Because you kind of gave
the joke away in your act.

1028
01:23:06.467 --> 01:23:07.906
I don't want to talk about this here.

1029
01:23:10.243 --> 01:23:12.259
Where you going?

1030
01:23:12.627 --> 01:23:17.043
- I'm a fucking psycho. 
- Preston.

1031
01:23:17.315 --> 01:23:18.675
You fucking psycho, Preston.

1032
01:23:19.331 --> 01:23:20.580
You can make fucking fun of me.

1033
01:23:20.996 --> 01:23:23.906
- Please, just calm down. 
- Oh, what?

1034
01:23:24.338 --> 01:23:25.778
Stay the fuck away from me.

1035
01:23:26.275 --> 01:23:29.106
Shut the fuck up.

1036
01:23:29.394 --> 01:23:30.466
Shut the fuck up.

1037
01:23:30.834 --> 01:23:31.682
Shut the fuck up.

1038
01:23:33.714 --> 01:23:34.706
Shut the fuck up.

1039
01:23:34.706 --> 01:23:35.058
Shut the fuck up.

1040
01:23:36.994 --> 01:23:38.817
Who did you show the video to?

1041
01:23:39.857 --> 01:23:41.041
Don't fucking lie to me.

1042
01:23:41.249 --> 01:23:42.529
I'm going to take my hand away, yeah?

1043
01:23:42.865 --> 01:23:44.689
If you scream, 
I will fucking got you.

1044
01:23:44.689 --> 01:23:45.505
You understand me, yeah?

1045
01:23:46.577 --> 01:23:48.193
Who did you show it to?

1046
01:23:49.442 --> 01:23:50.352
Don't fucking lie to me.

1047
01:23:50.416 --> 01:23:52.448
Don't fucking lie to me.

1048
01:23:53.313 --> 01:23:54.785
If you lie to me...

1049
01:23:54.785 --> 01:23:55.680
I loved it.

1050
01:23:59.088 --> 01:24:01.153
I know you know.

1051
01:24:02.016 --> 01:24:03.024
I don't think it's what you're thinking.

1052
01:24:03.873 --> 01:24:04.991
Don't wear me up.

1053
01:24:04.991 --> 01:24:06.720
- Wear down. 
- Let me explain.

1054
01:24:07.023 --> 01:24:08.480
Explain what? Explain what?

1055
01:24:08.480 --> 01:24:09.343
You tried to fuck me up.

1056
01:24:09.343 --> 01:24:11.008
I didn't. I didn't. 
I couldn't do it.

1057
01:24:11.360 --> 01:24:12.879
You couldn't go for it. 
You expect me to believe that?

1058
01:24:13.071 --> 01:24:15.023
- You expect me to believe that? -
I don't hurt you, yeah, but I couldn't.


1059
01:24:15.023 --> 01:24:16.800
- But what? 
- I just feel sorry for you.

1060
01:24:16.800 --> 01:24:16.848
- But what? - I
just feel sorry for you.


1061
01:24:16.848 --> 01:24:20.302
- But what? 
- I just feel sorry for you.

1062
01:24:20.302 --> 01:24:21.231
You felt sorry for me.

1063
01:24:29.774 --> 01:24:30.670
That's my phone.

1064
01:24:31.695 --> 01:24:33.358
Come here for them, back off.

1065
01:25:15.868 --> 01:25:25.868
No.

1066
01:25:58.714 --> 01:25:59.417
Fuck's sake!

1067
01:25:59.673 --> 01:26:01.432
Fuck the fuck!

1068
01:26:02.889 --> 01:26:04.217
I'm fucking wearing it!

1069
01:26:04.425 --> 01:26:05.497
Come in, fucking lie!

1070
01:26:07.257 --> 01:26:07.865
Fuckin' lie!

1071
01:26:14.056 --> 01:26:22.264
Get the fuck out of here.

1072
01:26:22.264 --> 01:26:23.368
Fuck it, lie.

1073
01:26:24.968 --> 01:26:25.928
You're so cute.

1074
01:26:26.936 --> 01:26:27.304
Fuck.
