1
00:01:40.339 --> 00:01:42.542
You know too much.

2
00:01:42.574 --> 00:01:44.177
Pablo is a fool.

3
00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:45.511
I know nothing.

4
00:01:45.544 --> 00:01:48.148
Your grandfather invited me,
not your father.


5
00:01:52.383 --> 00:01:54.619
Jose, you first.

6
00:01:58.223 --> 00:02:02.494
What the...
wait a minute.


7
00:02:04.597 --> 00:02:06.966
Ah!

8
00:02:57.615 --> 00:03:00.619
I was expecting
my lawyers.


9
00:03:00.652 --> 00:03:02.954
Your lawyers?

10
00:03:02.988 --> 00:03:04.924
They quit.

11
00:03:04.957 --> 00:03:08.293
They say you owe them
a lot of money.


12
00:03:08.327 --> 00:03:10.697
Do you know
who you killed?


13
00:03:12.031 --> 00:03:13.799
FBI.

14
00:03:13.832 --> 00:03:14.966
I'm a friend.

15
00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.836
I don't have friends.

16
00:03:16.869 --> 00:03:18.704
They're real curious.

17
00:03:18.737 --> 00:03:21.874
Why so many important
people down here


18
00:03:21.906 --> 00:03:26.344
want to kill
such an obscure journalist.


19
00:03:26.377 --> 00:03:29.714
I'm a photographer,
and not that obscure.


20
00:03:29.747 --> 00:03:31.851
Attitude.

21
00:03:33.418 --> 00:03:34.987
Can you help me?

22
00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:37.023
I just did.

23
00:03:37.055 --> 00:03:39.024
You make it to
the United States,


24
00:03:39.058 --> 00:03:42.027
- and we're prepared...
- You're kidding!


25
00:03:47.733 --> 00:03:49.502
Take the package.

26
00:03:49.535 --> 00:03:51.704
You need the clothes.

27
00:03:51.737 --> 00:03:53.805
That's it?

28
00:03:59.945 --> 00:04:04.716
If I were you, I'd try
to get out of here by tonight.


29
00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:07.453
I can't just
walk out of here.


30
00:04:22.501 --> 00:04:23.936
Tienes Papeles?

31
00:04:34.379 --> 00:04:37.316
Senior Pablo Estanza?

32
00:05:46.217 --> 00:05:48.621
Senorita Parker.

33
00:05:48.653 --> 00:05:51.589
Oh, you make me
very, very patriotic.


34
00:05:51.623 --> 00:05:53.058
You let him
bring me clothes?


35
00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:56.027
Si, why not?

36
00:05:56.061 --> 00:05:57.729
You're a nice lady.

37
00:06:00.097 --> 00:06:02.600
Except all the killing.

38
00:06:02.633 --> 00:06:03.936
No choice.

39
00:06:03.968 --> 00:06:05.470
Oh, no?

40
00:06:05.503 --> 00:06:07.540
Then why you
always killing?


41
00:06:07.573 --> 00:06:09.174
- Huh?
- I mean,


42
00:06:09.208 --> 00:06:11.744
I know you took photos
in the war,


43
00:06:11.777 --> 00:06:14.113
and now you mess
with the cartels


44
00:06:14.145 --> 00:06:17.482
There's not a whole of lot
of difference in the two, Jesus.


45
00:06:17.515 --> 00:06:20.218
All I know,
I just bring you supper.


46
00:06:20.251 --> 00:06:22.153
Jorge brings me supper.

47
00:06:22.186 --> 00:06:24.790
We very, very tight tonight.

48
00:06:24.823 --> 00:06:28.861
You and me, we the only ones
in the cell block.


49
00:06:30.595 --> 00:06:33.064
Hey, what you got?

50
00:06:33.097 --> 00:06:35.100
A bribe.

51
00:06:36.667 --> 00:06:40.939
Are they moving me
in the morning?


52
00:06:40.972 --> 00:06:44.576
Si, Mexico City.

53
00:06:49.013 --> 00:06:51.616
You got another bribe
in other hand?


54
00:06:51.650 --> 00:06:53.118
You won't like
this one as much.


55
00:06:53.150 --> 00:06:55.253
Oh, I bet I will.

56
00:06:55.287 --> 00:06:56.822
Are you married, Jesus?

57
00:06:56.854 --> 00:06:59.825
Si, dos muchachas.

58
00:06:59.857 --> 00:07:01.626
How much do you like
Pancho Villa?


59
00:07:01.660 --> 00:07:04.597
Hm.

60
00:07:04.629 --> 00:07:07.932
My wife,
she would kill me.


61
00:07:07.965 --> 00:07:09.167
Wrong answer.

62
00:07:52.044 --> 00:07:54.113
Senorita Parker,
you're late.


63
00:07:59.350 --> 00:08:03.088
- Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
- Chiclets! Chiclets!


64
00:08:03.121 --> 00:08:05.991
- Chiclets! Chiclets!
- No, no, no, no, no, no.


65
00:08:06.023 --> 00:08:08.593
Vamos, vamos, hey!

66
00:08:08.626 --> 00:08:10.162
Hey, wait, wait, wait.

67
00:08:10.194 --> 00:08:15.300
Have any one of you
seen this woman?


68
00:08:32.016 --> 00:08:33.285
Yeah.

69
00:08:33.318 --> 00:08:37.021
<i>She's back
and in the open.</i>


70
00:08:37.054 --> 00:08:39.090
I'm on my way.

71
00:08:39.890 --> 00:08:42.995
Thank you, folks.
Come back again.


72
00:08:45.831 --> 00:08:49.168
There's a guy
that's been calling for you.


73
00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:51.636
His voice
sounds like gravel.


74
00:08:51.669 --> 00:08:54.073
Charming.
What about the pics?


75
00:08:54.106 --> 00:08:56.674
I have him
your phone number.


76
00:08:56.708 --> 00:08:58.977
Bert, the pictures?

77
00:09:00.178 --> 00:09:02.347
I'm glad you were
in Tombstone.


78
00:09:02.381 --> 00:09:05.083
Well, I see your new found
faith came with a hobby.


79
00:09:06.684 --> 00:09:09.220
Well, I drank when
we were in Afghanistan.


80
00:09:09.254 --> 00:09:13.959
You know, salvation
has its benefits.


81
00:09:13.991 --> 00:09:17.295
As a cowboy/preacher,
I'm expected to drink.


82
00:09:17.328 --> 00:09:20.632
So now you're
a former Navy SEAL,


83
00:09:20.665 --> 00:09:23.001
Iraqi freedom press coordinator
turned preacher


84
00:09:23.035 --> 00:09:24.969
peddling pictures
of celebrities being bad.


85
00:09:25.002 --> 00:09:28.640
When did anyone
ever expect you <i>not</i> to drink?


86
00:09:28.674 --> 00:09:30.976
Yeah, it's crap work,
but, uh,


87
00:09:31.009 --> 00:09:33.212
the public loves it,

88
00:09:33.245 --> 00:09:36.280
and, God, the number one
movie star in the world


89
00:09:36.314 --> 00:09:39.017
sucking on a bottle
at a famous rehab.


90
00:09:39.050 --> 00:09:43.321
Gee, I wonder
how she got the bottle.


91
00:09:43.355 --> 00:09:44.890
Naughty girl.

92
00:09:44.923 --> 00:09:47.860
I'll bet you it was you
that gave him the bottle.


93
00:09:47.892 --> 00:09:49.227
How much?

94
00:09:49.261 --> 00:09:50.862
You're sure one
to judge, AJ.


95
00:09:50.895 --> 00:09:53.732
But, uh, be about three months
before you get the cash.


96
00:09:53.765 --> 00:09:55.234
Three months?!

97
00:09:55.266 --> 00:09:57.368
Bert, I don't
have three months.


98
00:09:57.401 --> 00:09:59.270
I need the cash.

99
00:09:59.304 --> 00:10:02.174
You have no idea how important
this pay check is.


100
00:10:02.207 --> 00:10:05.077
Look, I'm not a bank.

101
00:10:05.110 --> 00:10:07.880
These gossip mags
pay slow,


102
00:10:07.913 --> 00:10:11.283
not like the big boys
you used to cover the war for.


103
00:10:11.315 --> 00:10:12.984
You shit.

104
00:10:13.017 --> 00:10:14.786
Look, why don't you
come to LA with me.


105
00:10:14.819 --> 00:10:17.021
I could use a good
shooter like you.


106
00:10:17.054 --> 00:10:18.424
I never knew when you were
flying me around


107
00:10:18.457 --> 00:10:21.059
Iraq and Afghanistan
that you were such a...


108
00:10:21.092 --> 00:10:23.161
Business man!

109
00:10:23.194 --> 00:10:24.829
...tool.

110
00:10:24.862 --> 00:10:26.931
Look, I'll buy you
a sandwich.


111
00:10:26.964 --> 00:10:28.066
I have lunch date.

112
00:10:28.099 --> 00:10:29.901
You're dating again?

113
00:10:42.314 --> 00:10:43.915
AJ.

114
00:10:43.948 --> 00:10:48.920
Is it true what they say,
you know,


115
00:10:48.953 --> 00:10:52.256
that you killed half
the population of Mexico?


116
00:10:58.764 --> 00:11:01.100
Goodbye, Bert.

117
00:11:01.132 --> 00:11:03.735
Hey, I love your shirt!

118
00:11:24.155 --> 00:11:26.525
You let one get away,
little lady.


119
00:11:41.872 --> 00:11:43.441
I'll have hash browns,
two eggs over easy,


120
00:11:43.474 --> 00:11:45.443
a waffle, and some OJ.

121
00:11:45.477 --> 00:11:46.879
For you?

122
00:11:46.911 --> 00:11:49.781
Coffee, black,
and the check please.


123
00:11:49.814 --> 00:11:53.084
Oh, okay.
I'll get that going for you.


124
00:11:53.117 --> 00:11:54.819
I stuck my neck
out for you.


125
00:11:54.852 --> 00:11:57.955
Yeah,
thanks for the stun gun.


126
00:11:57.988 --> 00:12:00.258
You seemed to know
how to use it.


127
00:12:00.291 --> 00:12:02.126
You don't know me.

128
00:12:02.160 --> 00:12:04.262
You were supposed
to lay low.


129
00:12:04.295 --> 00:12:06.297
You outed yourself.

130
00:12:06.331 --> 00:12:09.334
I need money.
My lawyers need money.


131
00:12:09.366 --> 00:12:11.402
Everyone in this damn state
is suing me.


132
00:12:11.435 --> 00:12:13.504
Bottom line is you're
not producing.


133
00:12:13.538 --> 00:12:16.441
You've made over a dozen arrests
from my information.


134
00:12:16.473 --> 00:12:21.213
It's a quality issue,
not a quantity.


135
00:12:21.246 --> 00:12:25.250
You know what
I'm talking about?


136
00:12:25.283 --> 00:12:26.585
It doesn't bother me
to protect


137
00:12:26.617 --> 00:12:29.188
a cold blooded killer
like yourself.


138
00:12:31.155 --> 00:12:34.559
But I expect
complete cooperation.


139
00:12:34.592 --> 00:12:37.128
I'm not a murderer.

140
00:12:37.161 --> 00:12:39.597
It's the bureau that's keeping
the ninth circuit court


141
00:12:39.631 --> 00:12:43.168
from granting your
extradition to Mexico.


142
00:12:43.200 --> 00:12:46.537
It's not your money,
it's not your lawyers.


143
00:12:46.570 --> 00:12:49.340
I appreciate your help.

144
00:12:49.373 --> 00:12:52.610
The hell you do.

145
00:12:52.644 --> 00:12:54.313
I've helped.

146
00:12:57.048 --> 00:12:59.284
I've helped.

147
00:12:59.317 --> 00:13:02.621
I don't know as much
as you think I do.


148
00:13:02.654 --> 00:13:05.023
I'm just a photographer.

149
00:13:05.055 --> 00:13:06.557
That's a bunch of bull.

150
00:13:06.591 --> 00:13:09.161
Tell me about Pablo Estanza.

151
00:13:09.193 --> 00:13:11.564
I've never met
Pablo Estanza.


152
00:13:13.331 --> 00:13:15.366
You just killed his men.

153
00:13:25.075 --> 00:13:27.145
Who are they?

154
00:13:34.551 --> 00:13:38.389
Pablo Estanza and his
go to guy.


155
00:13:38.423 --> 00:13:40.458
Okay,
I took the pictures.


156
00:13:40.491 --> 00:13:42.461
I killed the go to guy.

157
00:13:46.064 --> 00:13:49.067
You're not going to
cooperate, are you?


158
00:13:49.099 --> 00:13:51.235
These guys...

159
00:13:51.269 --> 00:13:54.940
never ever forget.

160
00:13:54.972 --> 00:13:57.208
25 years from now,
I'll get a knock at the door


161
00:13:57.241 --> 00:14:00.444
from some long term memory
assassin boy.


162
00:14:00.477 --> 00:14:03.048
You guys...

163
00:14:03.081 --> 00:14:04.483
you always forget.

164
00:14:04.515 --> 00:14:06.517
You won't know my name
a week from today.


165
00:14:10.188 --> 00:14:11.957
No.

166
00:14:11.990 --> 00:14:14.059
I won't.

167
00:14:25.303 --> 00:14:26.505
Did he get my check?

168
00:14:26.538 --> 00:14:28.472
Nope.

169
00:14:28.506 --> 00:14:31.477
But the cute cowboy
in the corner did.


170
00:14:37.082 --> 00:14:39.650
Are you really
taking me to LA?


171
00:14:39.684 --> 00:14:42.219
Well, my plan was
to take Parker,


172
00:14:42.252 --> 00:14:45.991
but you do have
your talents.


173
00:14:46.024 --> 00:14:49.261
I can learn
to take pictures.


174
00:14:49.294 --> 00:14:51.230
Run and get
old Bert's truck.


175
00:14:59.270 --> 00:15:03.074
Sun never sets on old
Bert Riddley.


176
00:15:14.718 --> 00:15:16.420
You're slowing down,
beautiful.


177
00:15:16.453 --> 00:15:18.423
I could
have shot you.


178
00:15:18.456 --> 00:15:20.058
Always a kidder.

179
00:15:20.091 --> 00:15:21.592
Not kidding.

180
00:15:24.228 --> 00:15:28.432
And people wonder why
we aren't still married.


181
00:15:28.466 --> 00:15:30.068
I'm concerned about you.

182
00:15:30.101 --> 00:15:33.338
Chris, I haven't seen you
in over half a year,


183
00:15:33.371 --> 00:15:36.208
you swindled me out of my share
of the house, my savings.


184
00:15:36.241 --> 00:15:38.577
Quick money
is expensive money.


185
00:15:38.610 --> 00:15:40.178
I did you a favor.

186
00:15:40.211 --> 00:15:41.645
Yeah,
you divorced while I was


187
00:15:41.679 --> 00:15:43.180
in a Mexican jail.

188
00:15:43.213 --> 00:15:45.016
You don't understand
the position


189
00:15:45.049 --> 00:15:46.351
you put me in
with the agency.


190
00:15:46.384 --> 00:15:49.788
It's still very...
very...


191
00:15:49.820 --> 00:15:53.024
Uncomfortable?

192
00:15:53.058 --> 00:15:54.559
Why are you here?

193
00:15:54.592 --> 00:15:56.627
I'm in Arizona
working with customs.


194
00:15:56.660 --> 00:15:58.429
Homeland Security crap.

195
00:15:58.463 --> 00:16:01.000
No, I mean here.

196
00:16:04.468 --> 00:16:06.604
Here's the real favor.

197
00:16:09.440 --> 00:16:12.011
I'm not allowed to be
around guns.


198
00:16:13.578 --> 00:16:16.347
I worked with Jake on a gun
smuggling case.


199
00:16:16.381 --> 00:16:18.683
Real helpful.

200
00:16:18.716 --> 00:16:21.086
He needs a photographer.

201
00:16:21.118 --> 00:16:22.520
You need money.

202
00:16:24.488 --> 00:16:28.292
He said he'll pay
a thousand bucks.


203
00:16:28.325 --> 00:16:30.594
A thousand?

204
00:16:30.627 --> 00:16:33.297
I want to help you.

205
00:16:33.331 --> 00:16:36.402
I still have
feelings for you.


206
00:16:37.669 --> 00:16:40.739
Chris, we're going to miss
the movie.


207
00:16:47.544 --> 00:16:49.481
Take the help.

208
00:16:51.415 --> 00:16:53.517
Come on.

209
00:17:00.791 --> 00:17:03.494
<i>Please leave
a message after the tone.</i>


210
00:17:04.761 --> 00:17:07.866
<i>AJ, this is Bert!</i>
Call me!


211
00:17:46.538 --> 00:17:48.573
Tell me that gun
isn't loaded.


212
00:17:48.606 --> 00:17:52.410
Well...

213
00:17:52.443 --> 00:17:54.412
unloaded gun's
a useless one.


214
00:17:54.444 --> 00:17:56.514
Of course.
What was I thinking.


215
00:17:59.450 --> 00:18:02.354
You're that guy that bought
me breakfast for lunch.


216
00:18:02.386 --> 00:18:04.655
I've been expecting you.

217
00:18:04.688 --> 00:18:08.693
Chris said you'd be at
the O.K. cafĂ© on Thursday.


218
00:18:10.795 --> 00:18:13.665
And I like to look a horse
over before I buy her.


219
00:18:13.697 --> 00:18:14.765
I'm a horse?

220
00:18:14.799 --> 00:18:17.269
Hoping you're
a thoroughbred.


221
00:18:17.301 --> 00:18:19.436
Lot of time you end up
with a nag.


222
00:18:19.470 --> 00:18:20.838
Now I know
you're with Chris.


223
00:18:20.872 --> 00:18:24.309
My name's Jake.

224
00:18:24.341 --> 00:18:25.609
Jake Slaughter.

225
00:18:25.643 --> 00:18:27.812
AJ Parker.

226
00:18:27.845 --> 00:18:30.815
My ex-husband said
you need a photographer.


227
00:18:30.847 --> 00:18:32.416
Your name's been in
the paper lately


228
00:18:32.450 --> 00:18:35.487
and not real
complementary.


229
00:18:38.655 --> 00:18:40.591
It's worse
than it reads.


230
00:18:43.293 --> 00:18:46.197
Chris lied.

231
00:18:46.231 --> 00:18:48.534
I don't need
a photographer.


232
00:18:49.968 --> 00:18:52.270
Sorry I wasted your time.

233
00:18:52.302 --> 00:18:53.504
I'll go.

234
00:18:53.538 --> 00:18:55.707
You don't
want to make $5,000


235
00:18:55.740 --> 00:18:57.976
for a weeks worth of work,
do you?


236
00:18:58.009 --> 00:18:59.477
$5,000?

237
00:18:59.510 --> 00:19:01.613
It's about Paradise.

238
00:19:01.645 --> 00:19:04.249
I need to go to Paradise.

239
00:19:04.281 --> 00:19:06.550
I need <i>not</i>
to go to Paradise.


240
00:19:06.584 --> 00:19:08.220
It's a ghost town.

241
00:19:08.252 --> 00:19:11.857
A few years ago,
you did a spread on the place.


242
00:19:13.891 --> 00:19:16.528
Paradise.

243
00:19:16.560 --> 00:19:17.963
Why me?

244
00:19:17.995 --> 00:19:21.999
1933, the Walker County bridge
was destroyed,


245
00:19:22.032 --> 00:19:24.001
and it was the only way
to the high mesa


246
00:19:24.034 --> 00:19:25.970
and Paradise from
Arizona.


247
00:19:26.003 --> 00:19:27.539
Take a helicopter.

248
00:19:27.571 --> 00:19:29.306
The ride through country
is hell.


249
00:19:29.339 --> 00:19:31.009
I need to be discrete.

250
00:19:31.041 --> 00:19:33.677
A hunter, Edgar Stanton,
he's your man.


251
00:19:33.711 --> 00:19:35.480
He took me in.

252
00:19:35.512 --> 00:19:39.650
Well, he was
my first choice,


253
00:19:39.684 --> 00:19:42.487
but he died unexpectedly.

254
00:19:42.520 --> 00:19:44.623
Besides...

255
00:19:44.655 --> 00:19:47.259
Edgar wasn't trustworthy.

256
00:19:47.291 --> 00:19:48.626
You killed him?

257
00:19:48.659 --> 00:19:52.363
You're my third
and final choice.


258
00:19:53.597 --> 00:19:55.267
Your second choice?

259
00:19:55.299 --> 00:19:57.434
Another trust issue.

260
00:19:57.468 --> 00:19:59.537
How do I know
that <i>I</i> can trust <i>you?</i>


261
00:19:59.569 --> 00:20:01.639
Is it the cartel
or the federales


262
00:20:01.673 --> 00:20:04.009
paying you
to get me back into Mexico?


263
00:20:04.041 --> 00:20:06.310
Not my game.
Name your price.


264
00:20:06.344 --> 00:20:07.645
There's not enough money
in the world


265
00:20:07.678 --> 00:20:09.413
to get me back
over that border.


266
00:20:09.446 --> 00:20:11.348
You're
the coin collector.


267
00:20:11.382 --> 00:20:13.952
This is one last chance
for both of us.


268
00:20:13.984 --> 00:20:15.886
Name your price, Parker.

269
00:20:19.589 --> 00:20:22.526
What the hell?
Make her a partner.


270
00:20:22.559 --> 00:20:25.597
Why the hell is she hesitating?

271
00:20:25.629 --> 00:20:28.799
She says she needs
to talk to a friend.


272
00:20:28.832 --> 00:20:31.802
What a crock.
She has no friends.


273
00:20:31.836 --> 00:20:34.905
She's playing you.

274
00:20:34.938 --> 00:20:36.974
That woman is a walking
time bomb,


275
00:20:37.008 --> 00:20:41.046
and I see my dreams
just slipping away.


276
00:20:43.981 --> 00:20:46.550
Well, you screwed up
the other tries.


277
00:20:50.754 --> 00:20:52.089
I had to kill them.

278
00:20:52.123 --> 00:20:53.924
Sure.

279
00:20:53.957 --> 00:20:56.560
We've got to use her.

280
00:20:56.594 --> 00:21:01.299
But make sure we don't kill her
until after the job.


281
00:21:02.866 --> 00:21:05.703
You're serious,
ain't you?


282
00:21:05.736 --> 00:21:07.571
If AJ gets us to Paradise,

283
00:21:07.605 --> 00:21:10.474
I'll get us through customs
without her.


284
00:21:14.011 --> 00:21:15.547
Always the greed thing.

285
00:21:15.579 --> 00:21:17.316
Hey, you're
as greedy as I am.


286
00:21:18.516 --> 00:21:19.818
What the hell
are you doing?


287
00:21:19.850 --> 00:21:22.119
Fixing a trust problem.

288
00:21:52.849 --> 00:21:56.020
Pardoname padre,
porque he pecado.


289
00:21:56.052 --> 00:21:58.021
You may speak English,
my child.


290
00:21:58.055 --> 00:21:59.557
What is your sin?

291
00:21:59.589 --> 00:22:01.492
I need a friend.

292
00:22:01.526 --> 00:22:04.796
You have no friends
because of sin?


293
00:22:04.828 --> 00:22:08.500
My life has gone to hell.
People are trying to kill me.


294
00:22:08.532 --> 00:22:10.501
I may have to go to jail.

295
00:22:10.534 --> 00:22:13.437
I owe my lawyers over a quarter
of million dollars.


296
00:22:15.839 --> 00:22:17.908
And I've killed some men.

297
00:22:17.942 --> 00:22:21.145
Oh, you must be
AJ Parker.


298
00:22:21.178 --> 00:22:24.448
How can I help you?

299
00:22:24.482 --> 00:22:26.151
If I stay here,
I'm screwed.


300
00:22:26.184 --> 00:22:28.520
If I go back to Mexico
with this odd ball cowboy


301
00:22:28.552 --> 00:22:30.988
who kills people,
I'm sure to get shot.


302
00:22:31.021 --> 00:22:34.759
Not to mention my ex-husband
who isn't trustworthy.


303
00:22:34.791 --> 00:22:37.795
And then there's
Pablo Estanza.


304
00:22:37.828 --> 00:22:40.932
God, I need a sign.

305
00:22:40.964 --> 00:22:43.734
Slower please.

306
00:22:43.768 --> 00:22:45.636
Are you my friend,
padre?


307
00:22:45.670 --> 00:22:46.805
Of course.

308
00:22:46.838 --> 00:22:47.939
The hell you are.

309
00:22:47.972 --> 00:22:49.540
Ah!

310
00:22:56.914 --> 00:22:58.516
Bless you, Father.

311
00:22:58.549 --> 00:22:59.983
You are absolved
of all your sins.


312
00:23:00.017 --> 00:23:01.186
What happens
in the confessional...


313
00:23:01.219 --> 00:23:03.488
Stays in
the confessional.


314
00:23:03.520 --> 00:23:06.625
Go and sin no more,
AJ Parker.


315
00:23:08.225 --> 00:23:11.728
The Americanos cut her loose.

316
00:23:11.761 --> 00:23:14.566
There will be
no more excuses.


317
00:23:14.598 --> 00:23:16.768
Yes, sir.

318
00:23:16.800 --> 00:23:18.837
You should have gone
to the detention center.


319
00:23:18.869 --> 00:23:20.838
I know.

320
00:23:20.872 --> 00:23:24.509
But she is just
one woman.


321
00:23:42.960 --> 00:23:45.063
She was lucky
in the desert.


322
00:23:45.096 --> 00:23:48.232
And she was lucky
in the prison.


323
00:23:48.266 --> 00:23:50.602
Julio and his team
are dead.


324
00:23:50.635 --> 00:23:53.805
She killed them
in a church.


325
00:23:53.838 --> 00:23:56.674
That's not luck.

326
00:23:56.706 --> 00:23:58.842
Find her.

327
00:23:58.876 --> 00:23:59.978
Kill her.

328
00:24:00.011 --> 00:24:02.814
Or never come back.

329
00:24:02.847 --> 00:24:05.650
Yes, father.

330
00:24:07.018 --> 00:24:08.720
I feel like
I'm in a damn beauty parlor


331
00:24:08.752 --> 00:24:10.187
or a whorehouse.

332
00:24:10.221 --> 00:24:12.958
I need
to look different.


333
00:24:17.761 --> 00:24:20.097
You're aboard,
I take it?


334
00:24:20.130 --> 00:24:21.732
Full partner.

335
00:24:21.766 --> 00:24:23.635
You're in this with Chris,
aren't you?


336
00:24:26.136 --> 00:24:28.272
Thought so.

337
00:24:28.306 --> 00:24:31.075
Ah, don't worry.

338
00:24:31.107 --> 00:24:34.878
I'm no safer here
than in Mexico.


339
00:24:34.912 --> 00:24:36.847
And I need the money.

340
00:24:39.215 --> 00:24:40.251
How much are we talking?

341
00:24:40.283 --> 00:24:42.719
Lots.

342
00:24:42.752 --> 00:24:47.090
In 1933, FDR and congress
passed a law that


343
00:24:47.124 --> 00:24:49.727
more or less
outlawed gold money.


344
00:24:49.760 --> 00:24:52.195
In the spring of 1933,

345
00:24:52.229 --> 00:24:56.634
445,000 of those beauties
were struck.


346
00:24:56.666 --> 00:24:59.870
Most were melted down
right away.


347
00:24:59.904 --> 00:25:02.839
A real Double Eagle!

348
00:25:02.873 --> 00:25:04.208
It gets better.

349
00:25:04.241 --> 00:25:06.743
5,000 of those Double Eagles
were diverted


350
00:25:06.777 --> 00:25:09.013
by of couple
of Treasury workers,


351
00:25:09.046 --> 00:25:11.082
John McBride
and Matthew Henry.


352
00:25:11.115 --> 00:25:13.651
They hijacked
a federal reserve truck


353
00:25:13.684 --> 00:25:16.654
and headed to Mexico.

354
00:25:16.686 --> 00:25:18.722
- They crossed at Paradise?
- Yep.


355
00:25:18.755 --> 00:25:20.824
They crossed the high bridge
leading to Paradise,


356
00:25:20.857 --> 00:25:22.059
then blew it up.

357
00:25:22.093 --> 00:25:24.596
The truck was
found in Paradise.


358
00:25:24.628 --> 00:25:27.898
Tampico is where
Henry and McBride


359
00:25:27.932 --> 00:25:29.901
were murdered a year later
by bandits,


360
00:25:29.934 --> 00:25:34.172
and, uh, the gold coins
were never recovered.


361
00:25:34.204 --> 00:25:36.307
The one you're holding was given
to me by a rancher


362
00:25:36.339 --> 00:25:39.309
I saved two years ago
from being stabbed in a cantina.


363
00:25:39.343 --> 00:25:43.615
He said he found it
in the old saloon in Paradise.


364
00:25:43.647 --> 00:25:45.983
And you didn't go back
to Paradise with him?


365
00:25:46.017 --> 00:25:48.052
Well?

366
00:25:48.085 --> 00:25:50.288
Well, he said
the place was haunted


367
00:25:50.320 --> 00:25:52.357
and he wouldn't
go near it.


368
00:25:52.389 --> 00:25:55.092
And you still don't
the back way into Paradise?


369
00:25:55.126 --> 00:25:57.995
You, unfortunately,
are one of the few.


370
00:25:59.296 --> 00:26:02.799
Then I think
I should get a bigger cut.


371
00:26:02.832 --> 00:26:07.104
Then, I think you should just
shut up and strap this on.


372
00:26:16.681 --> 00:26:18.316
Looks good.

373
00:26:18.348 --> 00:26:20.918
Yeah, it looks real good.

374
00:26:23.253 --> 00:26:28.192
Well, I reckon,

375
00:26:28.224 --> 00:26:30.928
this seals our deal.

376
00:26:34.831 --> 00:26:37.200
Let's get
something straight.


377
00:26:37.233 --> 00:26:40.105
I don't fool around
on the job.


378
00:26:41.137 --> 00:26:43.140
There goes
another dream.


379
00:26:43.174 --> 00:26:44.675
Play your cards right,

380
00:26:44.709 --> 00:26:46.911
and you'll able to afford
a new jeep.


381
00:27:01.491 --> 00:27:04.228
Thanks, Bert.
No hard feelings.


382
00:27:04.261 --> 00:27:05.930
Who the hell is Bert?

383
00:27:05.963 --> 00:27:07.732
He's letting out my cat.

384
00:27:07.764 --> 00:27:10.934
Stick your phone in your pocket
and keep your eyes open.


385
00:27:13.037 --> 00:27:14.806
Your girlfriend
go back to Tucson?


386
00:27:14.838 --> 00:27:17.174
She probably ran
out of hair spray.


387
00:27:17.207 --> 00:27:19.743
Well, Joan was very upset
that you didn't join us


388
00:27:19.777 --> 00:27:21.479
for drinks
at the Crystal Palace.


389
00:27:21.511 --> 00:27:23.981
How much longer
to Los Flores?


390
00:27:24.013 --> 00:27:26.049
We'll be there
mid-afternoon.


391
00:27:26.082 --> 00:27:29.252
That is if we don't run
into bandits, police,


392
00:27:29.286 --> 00:27:34.258
the cartel,
federales or...


393
00:27:34.290 --> 00:27:35.859
the Mexican Army.

394
00:28:12.562 --> 00:28:14.998
Look closely.

395
00:28:15.031 --> 00:28:17.068
This a fool's errand.

396
00:28:19.470 --> 00:28:20.905
She is supposed
to have crossed


397
00:28:20.937 --> 00:28:23.807
the border
early this morning.


398
00:28:23.840 --> 00:28:26.943
Now, why would she do something
so stupid like that?


399
00:28:26.976 --> 00:28:29.446
Well, that's
the question, General.


400
00:28:32.849 --> 00:28:34.452
Now listen, gringo.

401
00:28:34.484 --> 00:28:37.288
We have better things
to do than to help


402
00:28:37.320 --> 00:28:40.124
the U.S. find
their little lost girl.


403
00:28:40.156 --> 00:28:41.458
We move out!

404
00:28:45.529 --> 00:28:47.898
Quiet!

405
00:29:04.347 --> 00:29:05.817
Get off that phone.

406
00:29:05.849 --> 00:29:07.385
Okay, bye.

407
00:29:30.974 --> 00:29:33.511
Why is she doing
the negotiating?


408
00:29:33.543 --> 00:29:36.246
Because
she's good at it.


409
00:29:36.280 --> 00:29:38.316
Women can't negotiate.

410
00:29:38.348 --> 00:29:41.386
You should see
my last alimony agreement.


411
00:29:46.557 --> 00:29:50.126
We could, um, stay here.

412
00:29:50.159 --> 00:29:51.228
- No.
- Right?


413
00:29:51.261 --> 00:29:52.929
We're getting supplies.

414
00:29:52.963 --> 00:29:54.965
We're getting the hell
out of town.


415
00:29:57.635 --> 00:30:00.905
Take your time.

416
00:30:00.937 --> 00:30:03.440
Hola, muchacha, buenas dias.

417
00:30:14.284 --> 00:30:17.187
Yeah, all right.

418
00:30:18.454 --> 00:30:21.491
Well, the Northern tunnel
is secure right now.


419
00:30:21.524 --> 00:30:24.127
Yeah, there was
a breach last night.


420
00:30:24.161 --> 00:30:27.265
Yeah, I just thought
you might want to know.


421
00:30:27.298 --> 00:30:29.500
Okay, yeah.

422
00:30:33.503 --> 00:30:36.473
Come on.
Hey, amigos, let's go, come on.


423
00:30:36.507 --> 00:30:39.376
Come on, rapidamente.

424
00:30:40.711 --> 00:30:42.380
Yeah, look, Pablo, look.

425
00:30:42.413 --> 00:30:44.347
I'll call you... I'll call you
in the morning once


426
00:30:44.380 --> 00:30:46.483
I get back from Naco
with the money.


427
00:30:46.517 --> 00:30:48.986
Yeah, all right.

428
00:31:04.501 --> 00:31:06.503
Hello, senorita.

429
00:31:06.537 --> 00:31:09.006
I don't know you.

430
00:31:09.039 --> 00:31:11.608
You're not very nice
to Felix.


431
00:31:13.309 --> 00:31:16.213
I don't know Felix.

432
00:31:17.481 --> 00:31:19.317
What do you want?

433
00:31:19.349 --> 00:31:21.017
Well, I figure if you're going
to spend the night


434
00:31:21.050 --> 00:31:22.720
in Los Flores,
you need a date.


435
00:31:22.752 --> 00:31:24.454
You know, someone to take you

436
00:31:24.488 --> 00:31:26.390
to the museums
or the opera.


437
00:31:26.423 --> 00:31:29.027
Tempting, but no.

438
00:31:30.560 --> 00:31:34.564
You're trading for horses?

439
00:31:34.597 --> 00:31:38.301
That old jeep of yours
can take you pretty much


440
00:31:38.335 --> 00:31:40.504
anywhere in the country.

441
00:31:40.537 --> 00:31:44.208
Except one place.
So I bet...


442
00:31:44.241 --> 00:31:45.675
I bet it's none
of your damn business.


443
00:31:45.709 --> 00:31:47.111
And I bet you always
carry a gun.


444
00:31:47.144 --> 00:31:48.479
Snakes are a bitch
down here.


445
00:31:48.511 --> 00:31:50.982
You work for the zoo?

446
00:31:53.649 --> 00:31:56.386
What do you do?

447
00:31:56.420 --> 00:31:58.089
I'm a photographer.

448
00:32:02.291 --> 00:32:04.095
On a job.

449
00:32:04.127 --> 00:32:06.129
You gonna make me famous?

450
00:32:09.032 --> 00:32:12.302
These men
bothering you, sis?


451
00:32:12.336 --> 00:32:14.472
No problem, amigo.

452
00:32:22.479 --> 00:32:25.516
Are you sure you
don't know Felix?


453
00:32:27.417 --> 00:32:29.285
Dead certain.

454
00:32:38.261 --> 00:32:40.330
I'm Max.
Max Taylor.


455
00:32:40.364 --> 00:32:42.033
Thanks.

456
00:32:42.066 --> 00:32:44.434
I'll help you take your horses
to your friends.


457
00:32:44.468 --> 00:32:47.171
- No thanks.
- I insist.


458
00:32:47.203 --> 00:32:49.107
The word is "no."

459
00:32:54.110 --> 00:32:56.079
Are we dating, and I'm just
to dumb to know it?


460
00:32:56.113 --> 00:32:57.682
Sorry.

461
00:33:00.084 --> 00:33:03.621
Kind of risky you being
south of the border, isn't it?


462
00:33:07.290 --> 00:33:08.792
Anything else you
can remember?


463
00:33:08.826 --> 00:33:11.362
I can't remember
anything else!


464
00:33:11.395 --> 00:33:14.097
Your man, he work
for the government.


465
00:33:14.130 --> 00:33:16.599
Why he so interested
in the American girl?


466
00:33:16.633 --> 00:33:18.568
I don't know!

467
00:33:20.236 --> 00:33:22.839
You lie, you die.

468
00:33:26.376 --> 00:33:30.513
Chris said he wanted her
to testify in some case.


469
00:33:30.547 --> 00:33:33.684
Ah, you live
a little longer.


470
00:33:34.584 --> 00:33:38.556
Let me go.
I don't know anything!


471
00:33:40.624 --> 00:33:42.193
Maybe you don't know
nothing.


472
00:33:42.225 --> 00:33:44.160
I really don't.

473
00:33:44.193 --> 00:33:46.430
Shallow grave, okay.

474
00:33:46.463 --> 00:33:47.630
Lay down!

475
00:33:47.664 --> 00:33:51.135
No! No! No!

476
00:33:51.167 --> 00:33:53.270
Any last words?

477
00:33:55.338 --> 00:33:57.508
Paradise.

478
00:33:57.540 --> 00:33:59.175
Paradise?

479
00:33:59.209 --> 00:34:01.812
It's a small ghost town
near Los Flores.


480
00:34:05.214 --> 00:34:07.484
Hola, Padre.

481
00:34:07.518 --> 00:34:09.186
I've learned
that she's headed to


482
00:34:09.219 --> 00:34:11.255
a ghost town
near Los Flores, Paradise,


483
00:34:11.288 --> 00:34:15.425
with the cowboy
and the FBI agent.


484
00:34:19.862 --> 00:34:22.165
I understand.

485
00:34:33.309 --> 00:34:36.514
I thought you said it was
a short ride to Paradise.


486
00:34:36.547 --> 00:34:39.782
We're taking
the long way, genius.


487
00:34:39.815 --> 00:34:41.751
Well, remember,
we got to be in Naco


488
00:34:41.784 --> 00:34:45.755
by next Thursday
with the goods.


489
00:34:45.788 --> 00:34:49.792
The American,
in Los Flores,


490
00:34:49.826 --> 00:34:51.762
he knew who you were.

491
00:34:53.596 --> 00:34:56.299
How long you notice
he's been following us?


492
00:34:57.934 --> 00:34:59.503
Maybe sunset.

493
00:34:59.536 --> 00:35:02.673
What the hell are you
talking about?


494
00:35:02.706 --> 00:35:04.408
Ask him.

495
00:35:09.346 --> 00:35:11.181
Who the hell are you?!

496
00:35:11.215 --> 00:35:13.651
My newest boyfriend,
Max Taylor.


497
00:35:13.683 --> 00:35:15.919
Max, met Chris and Jake.

498
00:35:15.953 --> 00:35:17.554
You need to
get out of here.


499
00:35:17.587 --> 00:35:19.290
I've tried that approach.

500
00:35:21.824 --> 00:35:23.259
What's up?

501
00:35:23.293 --> 00:35:26.564
You ain't
photographing crap.


502
00:35:26.596 --> 00:35:28.799
I know who AJ Parker is.

503
00:35:28.831 --> 00:35:30.400
She's worth a lot of money.

504
00:35:30.433 --> 00:35:32.569
AJ stays here.

505
00:35:36.005 --> 00:35:38.541
She's worth more to me.

506
00:35:38.574 --> 00:35:41.311
You got a death wish
coming down here with that girl.


507
00:35:41.344 --> 00:35:44.347
So, I thought, what
are you assholes doing?


508
00:35:44.380 --> 00:35:46.349
Must be worth
a lot of money.


509
00:35:46.382 --> 00:35:49.319
I see those metal detectors
and that pretty coin


510
00:35:49.353 --> 00:35:51.422
around that pretty neck.

511
00:35:51.454 --> 00:35:53.324
- What do you want?
- To be a partner.


512
00:35:53.357 --> 00:35:55.692
- Listen, you son of a...
- Don't get yourself killed.


513
00:35:55.726 --> 00:35:58.829
Make me a partner
or kill me.


514
00:35:58.862 --> 00:36:01.432
Kill him, Jake.
Kill the bastard.


515
00:36:01.465 --> 00:36:03.834
You're not a cold blooded
murderer, are you?


516
00:36:03.867 --> 00:36:06.971
Problem I got, is what happens
when the next stranger


517
00:36:07.003 --> 00:36:09.873
comes in here and has more
balls than brains.


518
00:36:09.905 --> 00:36:11.842
It's a dilemma.

519
00:36:11.875 --> 00:36:13.510
No, it's dumb luck.

520
00:36:13.543 --> 00:36:15.311
Jake, kill him.

521
00:36:15.344 --> 00:36:17.780
It ain't all that easy.

522
00:36:17.813 --> 00:36:19.983
Doesn't seem to be
that hard for AJ.


523
00:36:22.485 --> 00:36:23.953
I'm going to need those
when the bandits


524
00:36:23.987 --> 00:36:26.456
in Los Flores
catch up with us.


525
00:36:26.489 --> 00:36:29.292
Unsaddle your horse.
We'll sleep on it.


526
00:36:38.735 --> 00:36:41.771
I vote we shoot him.

527
00:36:41.804 --> 00:36:44.340
Yeah?

528
00:36:44.373 --> 00:36:46.809
I think you're
right for once.


529
00:36:46.842 --> 00:36:49.312
The person that shoots him
is a murderer.


530
00:36:49.346 --> 00:36:52.715
The other two
can hold it over him.


531
00:36:52.748 --> 00:36:54.718
Then we'll all have
to shoot him.


532
00:36:56.853 --> 00:36:58.755
This is bullshit.

533
00:36:58.788 --> 00:37:01.291
The guy's a pro.

534
00:37:01.324 --> 00:37:04.360
He'll wait till we find
the gold, then kill us all.


535
00:37:04.393 --> 00:37:06.396
We have to shoot him.

536
00:37:07.130 --> 00:37:08.931
He didn't shoot AJ
in Los Flores


537
00:37:08.965 --> 00:37:10.034
and collect her reward.

538
00:37:10.067 --> 00:37:12.369
He smells bigger money.

539
00:37:14.503 --> 00:37:16.706
I won't kill him.

540
00:37:16.739 --> 00:37:18.641
Then none of us will.

541
00:37:38.728 --> 00:37:41.431
Thanks for
saving my life.


542
00:37:41.465 --> 00:37:42.933
Jake, did you
see them?


543
00:37:42.965 --> 00:37:44.634
See who?

544
00:37:44.668 --> 00:37:47.905
Riders on the right,
about a minute ago.


545
00:37:47.938 --> 00:37:50.907
I just caught
a glimpse of them.


546
00:37:50.940 --> 00:37:52.742
Damn, I'm getting old.

547
00:37:52.775 --> 00:37:56.112
No, it was pure luck
I saw them. They're good.


548
00:37:56.146 --> 00:37:57.648
What the hell
is that?


549
00:37:57.681 --> 00:37:59.016
We've got company.

550
00:37:59.049 --> 00:38:00.384
What's the plan?

551
00:38:00.416 --> 00:38:03.320
Get out
of the ravine, now.


552
00:38:05.855 --> 00:38:07.524
Come on, hyah!

553
00:38:16.933 --> 00:38:20.436
Well...

554
00:38:20.469 --> 00:38:22.405
I didn't know it was you.

555
00:38:22.438 --> 00:38:24.607
You forget something?

556
00:38:24.641 --> 00:38:26.943
I forgot
how pretty she is.


557
00:38:26.976 --> 00:38:28.578
I missed you.

558
00:38:28.612 --> 00:38:30.514
Pictures I took of
you in Los Flores,


559
00:38:30.547 --> 00:38:31.682
they're not ready yet.

560
00:38:31.715 --> 00:38:35.419
Oh, pictures.

561
00:38:35.451 --> 00:38:37.820
Like my friend Raul
would say here,


562
00:38:37.853 --> 00:38:40.957
"We don't need
your stinking pictures."


563
00:38:40.991 --> 00:38:44.728
This is the only picture
that makes a difference.


564
00:38:44.761 --> 00:38:48.599
Now you come with us,
and no one needs to get hurt.


565
00:38:48.632 --> 00:38:51.802
And you can still leave.

566
00:38:51.835 --> 00:38:53.804
Of course.

567
00:38:53.837 --> 00:38:56.706
But with the woman.

568
00:38:56.739 --> 00:38:59.542
You know, my great granddaddy,
John Slaughter,


569
00:38:59.576 --> 00:39:02.112
had a saying.

570
00:39:02.145 --> 00:39:05.014
What was that, cowboy?

571
00:39:05.047 --> 00:39:09.585
Sometimes, you just got
to kill everybody.


572
00:39:21.498 --> 00:39:22.833
This is impossible.

573
00:39:22.866 --> 00:39:25.469
- I stopped the bleeding.
- He saved my life.


574
00:39:28.838 --> 00:39:30.706
He has kids and a wife.

575
00:39:30.739 --> 00:39:33.076
I swear they're
starting to stink.


576
00:39:34.643 --> 00:39:36.512
He's got kids and a wife.

577
00:39:36.545 --> 00:39:38.714
You want me
to dump him?


578
00:39:38.748 --> 00:39:41.050
No, he's alive.

579
00:39:41.083 --> 00:39:42.919
No kidding?

580
00:39:42.953 --> 00:39:45.655
- Well, we got to get going.
- No, we got to go back.


581
00:39:45.688 --> 00:39:46.757
We're not going back!

582
00:39:46.790 --> 00:39:48.558
This is about
more than money!


583
00:39:48.592 --> 00:39:51.494
There's cartel and federale
waiting in Los Flores.


584
00:39:51.527 --> 00:39:52.795
There's only one way out.

585
00:39:52.829 --> 00:39:55.232
Enough pissing and moaning.
Let's go!


586
00:39:55.264 --> 00:39:57.000
- I'll stay with him.
- No, I'll stay.


587
00:39:57.032 --> 00:39:59.502
No, I'll stay.
He's dying.


588
00:39:59.536 --> 00:40:01.038
Take Chris,
get to Paradise.


589
00:40:01.070 --> 00:40:02.605
Good idea.
Let's move.


590
00:40:02.639 --> 00:40:03.907
Gather our horses,
scatter the rest.


591
00:40:03.940 --> 00:40:06.076
Hey, Chris!
Scatter the rest!


592
00:40:06.108 --> 00:40:08.945
Take ours,
head to Canyon Diablo.


593
00:40:08.978 --> 00:40:10.580
Felix thinks
we're going that way.


594
00:40:10.614 --> 00:40:12.182
Take the rockiest path
to Paradise.


595
00:40:12.215 --> 00:40:13.717
But you don't know
the way.


596
00:40:13.750 --> 00:40:17.487
I'll track you easy.
Get going. Go! Go!


597
00:40:30.534 --> 00:40:31.568
Whoa.

598
00:40:36.306 --> 00:40:38.809
Felix, I'm shot.
I need a doctor.


599
00:40:38.842 --> 00:40:41.645
Yeah, well go rub
some dirt in it.


600
00:40:44.079 --> 00:40:45.581
Yeah?

601
00:40:45.614 --> 00:40:47.283
Pablo.

602
00:40:47.317 --> 00:40:49.520
Look, we need
some more men, okay?


603
00:40:49.552 --> 00:40:53.222
Some of those killers, those
mercenaries, some hired guns.


604
00:40:53.255 --> 00:40:55.259
Yeah.

605
00:40:55.291 --> 00:40:59.029
Yeah, she shot up my guys,
and then they road off.


606
00:41:00.730 --> 00:41:02.766
Yeah.

607
00:41:02.799 --> 00:41:06.869
Pablo, she's dangerous.

608
00:41:06.902 --> 00:41:09.805
Felix, don't mess
with that woman.


609
00:41:09.838 --> 00:41:11.141
Yeah.

610
00:41:11.174 --> 00:41:14.578
She was moving towards
Canyon Diablo.


611
00:41:14.610 --> 00:41:17.047
I don't know why.

612
00:41:17.079 --> 00:41:18.782
Yeah.

613
00:41:18.815 --> 00:41:22.552
Look, if it was up to me,
I'd let the wolves have her.


614
00:41:24.186 --> 00:41:26.123
All right.

615
00:41:26.155 --> 00:41:28.625
Pablo, this isn't what we do.

616
00:41:31.126 --> 00:41:33.297
All right.

617
00:41:33.329 --> 00:41:35.833
You're the boss.

618
00:41:37.199 --> 00:41:38.301
Yeah.

619
00:41:38.335 --> 00:41:41.871
I can be there, uh...

620
00:41:42.672 --> 00:41:45.708
...in the morning.

621
00:42:09.398 --> 00:42:11.701
God!

622
00:42:11.735 --> 00:42:14.605
Do you have to sneak up
on me like that?


623
00:42:14.637 --> 00:42:16.206
There's no sign of Jake.

624
00:42:16.239 --> 00:42:18.175
Or the bad guys.

625
00:42:21.043 --> 00:42:23.713
I don't need
to look again.


626
00:42:27.416 --> 00:42:29.619
He should
be coming by now.


627
00:42:29.652 --> 00:42:31.654
Maybe Felix
caught up to him.


628
00:42:31.688 --> 00:42:34.224
I don't know about that.

629
00:42:34.257 --> 00:42:36.893
What I do know.

630
00:42:36.925 --> 00:42:38.929
Our future
lies behind us.


631
00:43:12.829 --> 00:43:14.064
You get the supplies.

632
00:43:14.096 --> 00:43:15.898
I'll get the horses
out of sight.


633
00:43:15.931 --> 00:43:18.300
Kind of bossy,
aren't you?


634
00:43:18.333 --> 00:43:19.802
I just figured
you'd want to get


635
00:43:19.835 --> 00:43:21.771
these metal detectors
fired up.


636
00:43:23.373 --> 00:43:26.210
Ah, good idea.

637
00:43:28.244 --> 00:43:30.847
I'll get the saddlebags.

638
00:43:30.880 --> 00:43:32.883
I don't think we should stick
around here too long.


639
00:43:32.916 --> 00:43:34.684
I thought you set
on waiting for Jake.


640
00:43:34.717 --> 00:43:36.185
I think we should
just get rich


641
00:43:36.219 --> 00:43:38.454
and get the hell
out of here.


642
00:43:52.735 --> 00:43:56.105
These metal detectors are crap.

643
00:43:56.139 --> 00:44:00.143
So there aren't any gold coins
in the saloon, calm down.


644
00:44:00.175 --> 00:44:03.380
Bastard buys cheap
metal detectors.


645
00:44:03.413 --> 00:44:07.384
How are you planning
to get me across at Naco?


646
00:44:07.416 --> 00:44:08.951
I've got you covered.

647
00:44:08.985 --> 00:44:11.088
You wouldn't screw me,
would you?


648
00:44:11.121 --> 00:44:12.322
Well, I'm the one
that should have


649
00:44:12.355 --> 00:44:13.924
a trust issue,
beautiful.


650
00:44:13.956 --> 00:44:16.726
How's that?

651
00:44:16.759 --> 00:44:19.361
What's all this
killing business about?


652
00:44:21.463 --> 00:44:23.433
I do what I got to do.

653
00:44:23.465 --> 00:44:25.469
Maybe killing's too easy
for you.


654
00:44:31.007 --> 00:44:32.175
Shit!

655
00:44:32.208 --> 00:44:33.376
You scared me!

656
00:44:33.409 --> 00:44:35.212
You made it.

657
00:44:35.244 --> 00:44:37.780
Numbskulls.

658
00:44:37.813 --> 00:44:39.882
Why the hell
isn't anyone out on watch?


659
00:44:42.050 --> 00:44:45.889
Chris, get to the ridge,
take first watch.


660
00:44:45.922 --> 00:44:48.925
Hey, you fall asleep,
I'll brand you.


661
00:44:56.498 --> 00:44:58.901
You're a sight
for sore eyes.


662
00:44:58.934 --> 00:45:01.304
You look good
to me, too.


663
00:45:01.337 --> 00:45:03.306
Max...

664
00:45:06.442 --> 00:45:08.177
He died easy.

665
00:45:08.210 --> 00:45:10.312
I know it's beneath you,
but you think you can help me


666
00:45:10.346 --> 00:45:12.081
with my boots?

667
00:45:15.818 --> 00:45:18.320
Did you bury him?

668
00:45:18.353 --> 00:45:22.125
I put a little dirt on him,
and I said a prayer.


669
00:45:22.157 --> 00:45:25.194
Is Chris planning to take me
through Naco with you?


670
00:45:25.228 --> 00:45:27.496
Sure.

671
00:45:27.529 --> 00:45:30.966
I sure would hate
to have to shoot him.


672
00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:33.337
You guys do what
you guys do.


673
00:46:24.887 --> 00:46:27.389
No!

674
00:47:14.503 --> 00:47:16.272
For someone who's
so smart, you know,


675
00:47:16.306 --> 00:47:17.641
you didn't even reload
your own damn gun.


676
00:47:17.674 --> 00:47:19.175
Yeah, right.

677
00:47:19.208 --> 00:47:20.610
You don't even got the balls
to shoot anyone.


678
00:47:20.643 --> 00:47:22.913
Hey, you agreed we weren't
taking her back.


679
00:47:22.945 --> 00:47:24.313
The hell I did.

680
00:47:24.346 --> 00:47:27.116
Hey, your problem is you're
more interested


681
00:47:27.150 --> 00:47:29.686
in her T-shirts
than our agreement.


682
00:47:29.719 --> 00:47:31.253
Is that right?

683
00:47:31.286 --> 00:47:32.655
Yeah?

684
00:47:34.357 --> 00:47:36.358
I'll do it myself!

685
00:47:43.166 --> 00:47:45.669
If I go through one more
spooky building alone,


686
00:47:45.701 --> 00:47:47.469
I'm going to scream.

687
00:47:47.503 --> 00:47:50.407
Try lugging this
damn metal detector around.


688
00:47:50.440 --> 00:47:52.275
We got to be in Naco
in three days.


689
00:47:52.308 --> 00:47:54.311
We'll never make it
if we keep going through


690
00:47:54.344 --> 00:47:56.012
all the buildings
like this.


691
00:47:56.045 --> 00:47:59.115
Don't forget about
Felix and his pals.


692
00:47:59.148 --> 00:48:01.651
What did
the Mexican say again?


693
00:48:01.683 --> 00:48:05.154
He's dead certain that
the coins were underfoot


694
00:48:05.188 --> 00:48:08.023
and that he found a gold coin
in the old saloon.


695
00:48:08.056 --> 00:48:11.060
I'm glad you shot
that S.O.B.


696
00:48:13.695 --> 00:48:16.065
We agreed

697
00:48:16.099 --> 00:48:17.667
tomorrow's
the last day.


698
00:48:17.699 --> 00:48:19.568
- A day and a half.
- One more day!


699
00:48:19.601 --> 00:48:21.570
Shit!

700
00:48:21.603 --> 00:48:24.206
I left my camera bag
in the hotel.


701
00:48:24.239 --> 00:48:26.475
Will one of you
go with me?


702
00:48:26.509 --> 00:48:30.447
Sorry, beautiful,
no can do.


703
00:48:30.480 --> 00:48:31.681
Better get to the ridge
and take a look


704
00:48:31.713 --> 00:48:33.750
before it gets too dark.

705
00:48:33.782 --> 00:48:35.618
My heroes.

706
00:48:40.355 --> 00:48:42.558
Like I want to be left alone.

707
00:49:48.391 --> 00:49:50.659
Jake! Chris!

708
00:49:50.692 --> 00:49:52.728
Jake!

709
00:49:55.730 --> 00:49:58.267
That Mexican sure
steered us wrong.


710
00:49:58.300 --> 00:49:59.835
There's a difference
between hotel and saloon


711
00:49:59.869 --> 00:50:01.404
in Spanish.

712
00:50:01.436 --> 00:50:03.172
I know.

713
00:50:04.840 --> 00:50:07.076
You need a breather?

714
00:50:08.578 --> 00:50:11.047
I'll take
one damn coin.


715
00:50:12.849 --> 00:50:16.553
Crawl under here
and take a look.


716
00:50:16.585 --> 00:50:18.254
Watch for snakes.

717
00:50:21.357 --> 00:50:24.693
One damn coin.

718
00:50:24.726 --> 00:50:26.429
Proves they're here.

719
00:50:26.462 --> 00:50:28.331
No, they took them south
to Tampico.


720
00:50:28.364 --> 00:50:30.233
You're wrong.

721
00:50:34.170 --> 00:50:35.738
There's nothing.

722
00:50:35.771 --> 00:50:39.142
Nothing.

723
00:50:39.175 --> 00:50:40.811
Kill the lights.

724
00:50:46.616 --> 00:50:49.652
Better than nothing.

725
00:50:49.684 --> 00:50:52.422
This coin, I'll watch.

726
00:50:59.561 --> 00:51:02.132
Nothing but hornets.

727
00:51:02.165 --> 00:51:04.567
- Are you sure?
- There's nothing!


728
00:51:04.599 --> 00:51:06.603
I sure wish you would
volunteer for


729
00:51:06.636 --> 00:51:10.172
some of these
small spaces.


730
00:51:10.206 --> 00:51:13.510
Jake's expecting me to
take over up on the ridge.


731
00:51:13.543 --> 00:51:14.878
This lookout stuff
is crap.


732
00:51:14.911 --> 00:51:17.413
We'd be twice as effective
without it.


733
00:51:17.445 --> 00:51:19.382
Hey, what's going on
between you and Jake?


734
00:51:19.415 --> 00:51:21.217
What the hell
are you talking about?


735
00:51:21.250 --> 00:51:23.152
I've seen him
looking at you.


736
00:51:23.186 --> 00:51:25.422
- Maybe you should ask him.
- Ah!


737
00:51:29.692 --> 00:51:31.828
We're coming up empty.

738
00:51:31.860 --> 00:51:33.163
How's your ex?

739
00:51:33.195 --> 00:51:34.797
You wouldn't believe it.

740
00:51:34.829 --> 00:51:38.168
Well, you better
believe this.


741
00:51:40.670 --> 00:51:43.606
There must be
a couple dozen of them.


742
00:51:43.639 --> 00:51:45.775
You sure draw
a hell of a crowd.


743
00:51:45.808 --> 00:51:49.545
They're heading
to Canyon Diablo.


744
00:51:49.579 --> 00:51:50.813
Yeah, they'll
search there


745
00:51:50.846 --> 00:51:54.251
and head this way
in the morning.


746
00:51:58.887 --> 00:52:02.525
Just one other thing.

747
00:52:02.558 --> 00:52:04.661
Watch your back.

748
00:52:36.592 --> 00:52:38.795
So?

749
00:52:38.828 --> 00:52:40.829
So, they're camped out
north of the canyon.


750
00:52:40.862 --> 00:52:42.598
I can see their smoke.

751
00:52:42.632 --> 00:52:44.900
They're a little
overconfident.


752
00:52:46.402 --> 00:52:48.404
They think they've
got us trapped.


753
00:52:48.436 --> 00:52:50.440
Pretty close to the truth.

754
00:52:50.472 --> 00:52:51.873
If we leave at first light,
do you think


755
00:52:51.907 --> 00:52:54.811
we can work around them?

756
00:52:54.844 --> 00:52:56.813
It won't be easy.

757
00:53:01.851 --> 00:53:05.355
I didn't want it to end
like this.


758
00:53:05.387 --> 00:53:08.523
We'll get some money
with the coin that I found.


759
00:53:08.556 --> 00:53:11.793
No, I meant
in the graveyard.


760
00:53:11.826 --> 00:53:14.630
Well at least
we're not six feet under.


761
00:53:15.831 --> 00:53:17.300
Underfoot.

762
00:53:17.333 --> 00:53:20.270
Coins are underfoot.

763
00:53:20.302 --> 00:53:22.438
Remember me telling you
about Henry and McBride


764
00:53:22.471 --> 00:53:24.541
being shot in Tampico?

765
00:53:26.474 --> 00:53:28.478
They're not buried here?

766
00:53:28.511 --> 00:53:29.846
Not supposed to be.

767
00:53:29.878 --> 00:53:31.447
Dig faster.
Try keeping up with me.


768
00:53:31.480 --> 00:53:33.416
My God, there's so much.

769
00:53:45.860 --> 00:53:48.464
Get the horses,
saddle all the horses.


770
00:53:50.465 --> 00:53:53.603
I'm rich!

771
00:53:53.636 --> 00:53:55.304
Mwah.

772
00:54:13.588 --> 00:54:16.458
Money ain't gonna
fix that.


773
00:54:19.128 --> 00:54:21.698
So many people to bribe.

774
00:54:22.898 --> 00:54:24.967
So little time.

775
00:54:25.000 --> 00:54:27.369
You want to tell
me about it?


776
00:54:29.771 --> 00:54:32.509
What are you going to do
with your cut?


777
00:54:35.443 --> 00:54:38.581
Oh, I'm a simple man,

778
00:54:38.614 --> 00:54:39.882
I'd buy a shoreline

779
00:54:39.915 --> 00:54:43.920
and drink margaritas
and watch sunsets.


780
00:54:44.786 --> 00:54:47.489
That's it?

781
00:54:47.523 --> 00:54:52.028
My heart's set on
a million acre ranch in Texas.


782
00:55:00.703 --> 00:55:03.139
Why don't you get
some sleep?


783
00:55:03.172 --> 00:55:06.509
I'll wake you
at first light.


784
00:55:32.668 --> 00:55:34.470
She took one!

785
00:55:34.503 --> 00:55:36.940
The bitch took a sack
last night!


786
00:55:38.641 --> 00:55:41.577
You're an idiot.

787
00:55:41.610 --> 00:55:43.546
I'll show her.

788
00:55:45.047 --> 00:55:46.849
And a fool.

789
00:55:50.585 --> 00:55:52.888
You really aren't taking her
back across, are you?


790
00:55:52.922 --> 00:55:54.690
That's the plan.

791
00:55:54.722 --> 00:55:56.759
That's <i>your</i> plan.

792
00:55:56.791 --> 00:55:58.862
What are you guys
talking about?


793
00:56:00.094 --> 00:56:01.930
About how Chris is going
to screw you over.


794
00:56:01.963 --> 00:56:05.434
Too late for that.

795
00:56:05.467 --> 00:56:07.770
Screw both of you.

796
00:56:28.056 --> 00:56:31.126
You guys need to get a grip
on reality real soon.


797
00:56:31.159 --> 00:56:34.730
And what might
that be?


798
00:56:34.762 --> 00:56:37.900
You sitting around
on your butt like usual?


799
00:56:39.869 --> 00:56:41.237
She's right.

800
00:56:41.270 --> 00:56:43.206
Right about what?

801
00:56:44.974 --> 00:56:46.776
We need more horses.

802
00:56:52.248 --> 00:56:54.217
We got too much.

803
00:56:54.250 --> 00:56:56.652
One day,
we're too broke to swim,


804
00:56:56.684 --> 00:56:59.255
and the next day,
we're drowning in gold.


805
00:57:00.889 --> 00:57:02.791
Not funny.

806
00:57:10.933 --> 00:57:16.038
We take even shares
and stash the rest.


807
00:57:16.070 --> 00:57:17.773
We can't.

808
00:57:20.942 --> 00:57:23.212
You take your
gold and stay.


809
00:57:25.748 --> 00:57:30.787
Take mine and head to Naco
before our luck runs out.


810
00:57:31.320 --> 00:57:33.655
Our luck
just ran out.


811
00:57:33.688 --> 00:57:35.824
Senorita Parker!

812
00:57:39.027 --> 00:57:41.796
Who the hell is that?

813
00:57:41.829 --> 00:57:43.799
- Friend of yours?
- I'll take care of it.


814
00:57:43.831 --> 00:57:45.201
No.

815
00:57:45.233 --> 00:57:46.701
Not without me.

816
00:57:46.735 --> 00:57:48.538
What about the gold?

817
00:57:48.570 --> 00:57:51.072
I've been looking for you.

818
00:57:51.105 --> 00:57:53.675
How the hell
did he find us?


819
00:57:53.708 --> 00:57:58.880
Miss Joan,
she was most helpful.


820
00:57:58.913 --> 00:58:00.049
Chris, did you
tell your girlfriend


821
00:58:00.081 --> 00:58:01.951
where we were going?

822
00:58:01.983 --> 00:58:03.953
But...

823
00:58:03.985 --> 00:58:07.123
she's not helpful no more.

824
00:58:07.155 --> 00:58:09.958
Let's just
get out of here.


825
00:58:09.992 --> 00:58:12.695
We make love now.

826
00:58:12.728 --> 00:58:14.697
Let's move.

827
00:59:12.054 --> 00:59:15.057
So good to see you again,
Senorita Parker.


828
00:59:16.659 --> 00:59:18.628
Last time,
you spoiled my fun.


829
00:59:18.661 --> 00:59:22.030
This time, I don't
make the same mistake.


830
00:59:24.967 --> 00:59:27.403
Oh, you recognize
me, punta?


831
00:59:27.436 --> 00:59:28.938
Aah!

832
00:59:28.971 --> 00:59:31.040
You remember
our Christmas ride?


833
00:59:31.873 --> 00:59:33.108
Aah!

834
00:59:34.208 --> 00:59:35.377
I remember the stench!

835
00:59:38.213 --> 00:59:40.315
Oh, you like it rough?

836
00:59:40.715 --> 00:59:43.318
Hector likes rough.

837
00:59:43.351 --> 00:59:45.120
I think we really play
rough now.


838
00:59:45.154 --> 00:59:46.389
I thought I killed you
last time.


839
00:59:46.422 --> 00:59:48.724
You killed my friends.
I live!


840
00:59:48.757 --> 00:59:50.994
Not for long,
you son of a bitch!


841
01:00:14.248 --> 01:00:17.219
I had to save
the bastard from you.


842
01:00:21.857 --> 01:00:24.360
Go get Chris. Go.

843
01:00:24.393 --> 01:00:27.797
Go. I'll be all right. Go.
Son of a bitch.


844
01:00:32.034 --> 01:00:34.136
Chris!

845
01:00:34.168 --> 01:00:36.237
Chris, Jake needs you!

846
01:00:36.271 --> 01:00:38.941
I figured out how we're going
to get our shares out.


847
01:00:40.942 --> 01:00:44.245
You can't just
leave us here!


848
01:00:44.279 --> 01:00:47.183
I was never planning
on taking you back.


849
01:00:47.215 --> 01:00:50.251
Have fun with your
Mexican friends.


850
01:00:50.284 --> 01:00:53.221
You son of a bitch!

851
01:00:53.255 --> 01:00:55.224
I'll get you back!

852
01:00:55.257 --> 01:00:58.193
No, you won't.

853
01:00:58.226 --> 01:01:00.762
When you shot those guys
in the desert,


854
01:01:00.795 --> 01:01:03.031
did they die with smiles
on their faces?


855
01:01:06.768 --> 01:01:09.938
You pathetic greedy
little man.


856
01:01:12.340 --> 01:01:14.210
Go to hell.

857
01:01:28.222 --> 01:01:30.826
That was easier than I thought.

858
01:02:17.940 --> 01:02:19.509
Ah!

859
01:02:24.079 --> 01:02:25.548
Mwah!

860
01:02:33.454 --> 01:02:35.391
Jake got soft on me.

861
01:02:38.159 --> 01:02:40.428
I should have shot her again.

862
01:02:40.462 --> 01:02:42.565
Double tap rule.

863
01:02:42.597 --> 01:02:45.601
Always remember.

864
01:02:45.634 --> 01:02:48.003
No, no, no, I got her clean.

865
01:02:58.947 --> 01:03:00.549
I did the right thing, didn't I?

866
01:03:20.402 --> 01:03:22.137
It's them.

867
01:03:22.170 --> 01:03:23.873
Three riders and a pack horse.

868
01:03:23.905 --> 01:03:25.340
The did not
go to Paradise?


869
01:03:25.373 --> 01:03:28.576
No, no, these tracks
head towards the border.


870
01:03:40.188 --> 01:03:43.025
Make sure there's nothing
left in Paradise but ghosts.


871
01:03:45.393 --> 01:03:47.562
All right. Let's ride.

872
01:03:47.596 --> 01:03:49.965
Vamos!

873
01:04:11.420 --> 01:04:13.923
This has got
to be heaven.


874
01:04:16.058 --> 01:04:18.126
Thank God you're awake.

875
01:04:24.333 --> 01:04:26.269
What happened out there?

876
01:04:30.605 --> 01:04:33.509
Chris shot me.

877
01:04:33.541 --> 01:04:36.011
Took the gold.

878
01:04:36.043 --> 01:04:37.645
How are you?

879
01:04:37.679 --> 01:04:39.648
Breathing better.

880
01:04:43.585 --> 01:04:46.621
Chris couldn't hit
the broadside of a barn.


881
01:04:48.422 --> 01:04:50.558
Managed to tag this.

882
01:04:55.396 --> 01:04:57.333
Now it's worthless.

883
01:05:02.170 --> 01:05:05.040
I don't think
it's worthless.


884
01:05:05.072 --> 01:05:08.043
It looks worth
a million bucks to me.


885
01:05:09.543 --> 01:05:14.282
He took the horses,
the gold.


886
01:05:14.315 --> 01:05:16.684
It's all right.

887
01:05:16.717 --> 01:05:18.453
Except we need
the horses.


888
01:05:18.487 --> 01:05:20.523
How did you
get me down here?


889
01:05:22.324 --> 01:05:25.427
You helped a lot more
than you remember.


890
01:05:25.460 --> 01:05:27.496
At least we're both
still alive.


891
01:05:38.273 --> 01:05:41.443
What do you got going on
with the cartels?


892
01:05:43.210 --> 01:05:45.380
Long or short?

893
01:05:45.413 --> 01:05:48.216
We ain't got long.

894
01:05:48.250 --> 01:05:52.353
Hector,
the ugly guy you shot,


895
01:05:52.387 --> 01:05:56.125
he's one of the guys that tried
to kill me six months ago.


896
01:05:56.157 --> 01:05:58.460
I killed
a couple of his pals.


897
01:05:58.492 --> 01:06:02.498
Thought I killed him.
Obviously I was wrong.


898
01:06:04.331 --> 01:06:06.601
What do they got
against you?


899
01:06:08.436 --> 01:06:11.572
Well, I was shooting
some drug stuff,


900
01:06:11.605 --> 01:06:13.775
the smugglers
were cooperating,


901
01:06:13.808 --> 01:06:17.678
the federales
were financing.


902
01:06:17.712 --> 01:06:22.284
Some horny old guy invited me
to a Christmas party in Hermosa.


903
01:06:22.317 --> 01:06:25.487
So I went.

904
01:06:25.520 --> 01:06:27.155
That horny old guy
turned out to be


905
01:06:27.188 --> 01:06:30.491
Pablo Estanza's father.

906
01:06:30.525 --> 01:06:33.128
You keep bad company.

907
01:06:36.130 --> 01:06:39.367
Everyone was there.

908
01:06:39.400 --> 01:06:40.835
It was early morning
when Pablo came to


909
01:06:40.869 --> 01:06:44.373
the realization
that I spoke fluent Spanish


910
01:06:44.405 --> 01:06:46.808
and that I knew
way too much.


911
01:06:49.411 --> 01:06:53.648
So Hector decided I needed
a one way ticket to the desert.


912
01:06:53.681 --> 01:06:56.350
What's your other
curiosity?


913
01:06:56.384 --> 01:06:59.655
What's your dream?

914
01:06:59.688 --> 01:07:01.424
Mountains.

915
01:07:04.425 --> 01:07:06.561
Colorado.

916
01:07:09.498 --> 01:07:11.366
Home.

917
01:07:20.775 --> 01:07:22.677
Where are the other horses?

918
01:07:25.179 --> 01:07:27.148
No!

919
01:07:27.181 --> 01:07:28.650
No!

920
01:07:31.386 --> 01:07:32.721
You bastards!

921
01:07:32.753 --> 01:07:35.090
I know your game!

922
01:07:53.273 --> 01:07:55.710
You're not stealing my gold.

923
01:07:58.212 --> 01:08:00.615
Jake.

924
01:08:00.648 --> 01:08:03.284
They're here! Let's move!

925
01:08:03.317 --> 01:08:04.418
Why are we moving?

926
01:08:04.451 --> 01:08:05.620
We got to get
to a safer place.


927
01:08:05.654 --> 01:08:07.389
There ain't
a safer place.


928
01:08:07.422 --> 01:08:08.757
Shut up! I don't have
the time to argue.


929
01:08:08.790 --> 01:08:10.791
You can't hide
in this town.


930
01:08:10.824 --> 01:08:12.460
They would have
been here by now.


931
01:08:12.494 --> 01:08:14.363
They tracked
Chris' trail.


932
01:08:14.396 --> 01:08:15.631
We got a couple of hours,

933
01:08:15.663 --> 01:08:17.832
then we're going
to have company.


934
01:08:17.866 --> 01:08:20.136
I can think of a few things
left to do.


935
01:08:22.636 --> 01:08:24.372
Senorita Parker!

936
01:08:24.405 --> 01:08:28.243
How nice
it is to see you again.


937
01:08:28.275 --> 01:08:29.810
Can you shoot?

938
01:08:29.844 --> 01:08:31.579
I can do more than that.

939
01:08:36.685 --> 01:08:38.353
Let's go.

940
01:08:38.385 --> 01:08:40.354
Go!

941
01:08:51.233 --> 01:08:52.534
Hey!

942
01:08:52.567 --> 01:08:53.769
I'm out.

943
01:09:16.925 --> 01:09:18.561
Ah!

944
01:09:49.491 --> 01:09:50.958
Damn, we're trapped!

945
01:09:50.992 --> 01:09:52.261
I've had it worse.

946
01:09:53.994 --> 01:09:56.597
Should have left this woman
to the wolves.


947
01:10:10.778 --> 01:10:12.614
Bring the horses.

948
01:10:13.448 --> 01:10:15.716
What in the hell
are they waiting for?


949
01:10:26.927 --> 01:10:28.963
<i>Andele.</i>

950
01:10:31.433 --> 01:10:33.902
How we looking?

951
01:10:33.935 --> 01:10:36.005
Cowards are riding off.

952
01:10:40.375 --> 01:10:42.677
I should have shot her again.

953
01:10:51.051 --> 01:10:52.753
AJ, leave me.

954
01:10:52.787 --> 01:10:54.756
There's no way.

955
01:10:54.788 --> 01:10:55.924
Really?

956
01:10:55.957 --> 01:10:57.592
Suck it up, cowboy.

957
01:10:57.625 --> 01:10:59.994
The tracks are up ahead.

958
01:11:05.734 --> 01:11:07.969
Think you need
a longer post.


959
01:11:08.002 --> 01:11:10.673
Or a newly poor cowboy.

960
01:11:20.515 --> 01:11:22.718
We can't take this
contraption.


961
01:11:22.751 --> 01:11:27.956
So, if we take it north,
we run into Walker Canyon,


962
01:11:27.988 --> 01:11:30.458
and it's a 2,000 foot
free fall.


963
01:11:32.460 --> 01:11:34.430
Can you help?

964
01:11:37.097 --> 01:11:41.903
Yeah, a 2,000 foot
free fall kills most people.


965
01:11:45.907 --> 01:11:48.444
I can handle this.

966
01:11:49.944 --> 01:11:51.914
I'm a smart guy.

967
01:11:57.585 --> 01:12:00.555
Get to Naco.

968
01:12:00.587 --> 01:12:03.858
Get a few supplies, some men.

969
01:12:03.891 --> 01:12:05.927
Men I can trust.

970
01:12:11.698 --> 01:12:15.069
You thought I was stupid enough
to forget to mark my stash, huh?


971
01:12:30.018 --> 01:12:33.654
These superstitious peasants
won't bother a grave.


972
01:12:53.707 --> 01:12:55.210
Easy, easy.

973
01:13:30.110 --> 01:13:32.948
Well, is she dead?

974
01:13:34.082 --> 01:13:36.084
We set fire
to the building.


975
01:13:36.117 --> 01:13:37.920
Did you see her burn?

976
01:13:40.622 --> 01:13:42.491
No.

977
01:13:59.541 --> 01:14:02.110
I will give you the benefit
of the doubt this time.


978
01:14:04.311 --> 01:14:08.216
This man,
he knew better.


979
01:14:08.248 --> 01:14:13.988
But you, Americano,
I can use someone like you.


980
01:14:14.021 --> 01:14:17.259
Go to Paradise
and kill them.


981
01:14:17.292 --> 01:14:19.661
If I see you again
before this has happened,


982
01:14:19.694 --> 01:14:22.297
the flies will feed
on you, as well.


983
01:14:22.329 --> 01:14:25.966
So, you have now lied
to me twice.


984
01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:29.837
Once about the woman,
once about the town.


985
01:14:36.743 --> 01:14:38.979
I think I kill you now.

986
01:14:39.012 --> 01:14:41.550
Gold!

987
01:14:41.582 --> 01:14:44.286
I can give you gold.

988
01:14:44.319 --> 01:14:47.756
I don't see no gold!

989
01:14:49.623 --> 01:14:52.260
He'll try the old 'gold buried

990
01:14:52.292 --> 01:14:53.961
in the desert' trick.

991
01:15:04.771 --> 01:15:06.274
Where's the girl?

992
01:15:06.306 --> 01:15:09.610
I've got gold!

993
01:15:09.644 --> 01:15:11.613
I don't want gold.

994
01:15:11.645 --> 01:15:13.948
I want AJ Parker.

995
01:15:16.818 --> 01:15:20.655
My dog, Muchacho, thinks
I should just kill you now.


996
01:15:20.688 --> 01:15:24.092
She... She's in Paradise!

997
01:15:24.125 --> 01:15:27.095
But you can't have her.

998
01:15:29.396 --> 01:15:31.232
Yes.

999
01:15:31.265 --> 01:15:32.934
I can.

1000
01:15:34.002 --> 01:15:36.238
Aaah!

1001
01:16:48.710 --> 01:16:50.645
You were leaving me?!

1002
01:16:52.246 --> 01:16:55.050
The hell I was!

1003
01:17:12.734 --> 01:17:15.236
Give me your cigar!

1004
01:17:42.197 --> 01:17:44.431
How close does this get us
to the canyon?


1005
01:17:44.465 --> 01:17:47.335
Too damn close!
We're running out of track!


1006
01:17:56.978 --> 01:17:58.779
Short sighted!

1007
01:17:58.813 --> 01:18:01.783
What? I can't have
an exit strategy?


1008
01:18:47.461 --> 01:18:50.331
Just like
old times, huh, AJ?


1009
01:18:50.363 --> 01:18:51.933
Just like old times!

1010
01:18:51.966 --> 01:18:53.968
You did good, AJ!

1011
01:18:54.001 --> 01:18:56.104
Better to be alive
and poor then.


1012
01:18:56.136 --> 01:18:58.405
How about
alive and rich?


1013
01:19:00.507 --> 01:19:02.976
Damn if I ain't in love!

1014
01:19:33.407 --> 01:19:35.310
Colorado?

1015
01:19:37.244 --> 01:19:39.514
And Caribbean?

1016
01:19:39.546 --> 01:19:42.416
I didn't say I wouldn't.

1017
01:19:42.449 --> 01:19:45.554
No, you just didn't
buy a ticket.


1018
01:19:48.421 --> 01:19:51.259
I've got some stuff
to do at home first.


1019
01:19:51.292 --> 01:19:53.261
Maybe in a week or two.

1020
01:19:56.162 --> 01:19:59.399
Some stuff to do?

1021
01:19:59.433 --> 01:20:03.304
If I don't know the queen
of lame excuses.


1022
01:20:03.336 --> 01:20:06.473
I'll be buying a ranch
in Texas for a week.


1023
01:20:08.109 --> 01:20:10.278
And, um...

1024
01:20:10.310 --> 01:20:12.581
I expect to see you.

1025
01:20:14.982 --> 01:20:17.284
After?

1026
01:20:17.318 --> 01:20:20.188
Oh, either I'll be there,
or I won't.


1027
01:21:10.738 --> 01:21:13.642
Jake! Wait!

1028
01:21:16.310 --> 01:21:18.146
I knew it.

1029
01:21:47.208 --> 01:21:50.630
