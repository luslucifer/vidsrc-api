YOU'RE CRAZY. YOU'

YOU'RE SUCH AN IDIOT.

I GIVE YOU MONEY.

7
00:00:39.182 --> 00:00:41.184
YOU COULD NEVER
GIVE ME ENOUGH MONEY.


8
00:00:41.184 --> 00:00:43.219
I GIVE YOU MORE MONEY
THAN ELIJA GIVES YOU!


9
00:00:43.219 --> 00:00:45.137
IF YOU DON'T STOP,

00:00:45.137 --> 00:00:48.190
I'M GONNA TELL ELIJA
THAT BABY ISN'T HIS,

00:04:24.812 --> 00:04:26.313
OK.
OK, GOOD.


50
00:04:26.314 --> 00:04:27.815
WHAT IS THE NEXT STEP

51
00:04:27.815 --> 00:04:31.318
AFTER A CASE IS
ARGUED BEFORE A COURT OF APPEALS?


52
00:04:31.319 --> 00:04:34.822
IT'S REVIEWED BY A BOARD
THEN SENT ON TO THE NEXT HIGHEST COURT IN THE DISTRICT


53
00:04:34.822 --> 00:04:36.323
IKE. IKE.
WHAT'S WRONG?


54
00:04:36.324 --> 00:04:40.828
HONEY, YOU WEAR THESE
THINGS NIGHT AND DAY WITHOUT SOCKS, AND THEY STINK.


55
00:04:41.329 --> 00:04:42.830
BABY, THOSE ARE
$30 SUPERSTAR SHOES.


56
00:04:43.331 --> 00:04:46.334
THAT MAY BE SO,
BUT WOULD YOU MIND PUTTING THEM OUTSIDE?


57
00:04:46.334 --> 00:04:48.836
IF I PUT 'EM OUTSIDE,
SOMEBODY MIGHT STEAL 'EM.


58
00:04:48.836 --> 00:04:51.839
HA! THEY WON'T
BE ABLE TO GET CLOSE ENOUGH.


59
00:04:51.839 --> 00:04:53.841
OH, THAT'S COLD.

60
00:04:53.841 --> 00:04:56.844
IF SOMEBODY MAKES OFF
WITH MY TRACK SHOES, IT'S ON YOU, HEAR?


61
00:04:57.345 --> 00:04:59.347
I WILL TAKE ALL
THE RESPONSIBILITY.


62
00:04:59.347 --> 00:05:01.849
YOU HEARD THAT,

63
00:05:06.105 --> 00:05:07.106
HONEY, UM...

HEY, LET'S KNOCK IT OFF

65
00:05:13.112 --> 00:05:15.614
I'VE HAD ENOUGH LAW.

66
00:05:15.615 --> 00:05:17.617
I HAVE A
VERY GOOD IDEA.


67
00:05:17.617 --> 00:05:20.620
I THINK, A NIGHT OUT ON
THE TOWN WILL DO YOU A WHOLE LOT OF GOOD.


68
00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:22.121
NO, CAN'T DO IT, BABY.

69
00:05:22.121 --> 00:05:23.622

NOW, LISTEN,

73
00:05:30.129 --> 00:05:32.131
IT'S BEEN AGES SINCE
WE'VE BEEN ANYWHERE.


74
00:05:32.131 --> 00:05:33.632
IT'LL THROW
ME OFF, BABY.


75
00:05:34.133 --> 00:05:35.634
COME ON, IKE,

76
00:05:35.635 --> 00:05:38.638
HOW OFTEN
DO YOU CELEBRATE A 1st ANNIVERSARY?


77
00:05:40.139 --> 00:05:41.140
HMM?

WHY DO I LET YOU GET ME

00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:43.202
BETTER CLOSE
YOUR MOUTH, KID.


85
00:06:44.704 --> 00:06:47.707
I COULD NEVER
DO ANYTHING LIKE THAT. COULD YOU, CHRISTELLA?


86
00:06:47.707 --> 00:06:50.292
AT LEAST NOT

100
00:08:00.780 --> 00:08:02.281
SARA DIVINE,
THE HIP HYPNOTIST.


101
00:08:02.748 --> 00:08:03.782

102
00:08:03.783 --> 00:08:06.285
CATCH THIS SHOW.
IT'S THE BEST SHOW.


103
00:08:18.297 --> 00:08:20.299
RELAX, FELLAS.
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,


104
00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:22.802
JUST A FEW SECONDS
OF SERIOUSNESS.


105
00:08:22.802 --> 00:08:25.304
I WANT TO EXPLAIN EXACTLY
WHAT'LL BE HAPPENING WITH THESE BOYS.


106
00:08:25.304 --> 00:08:27.306
NO. 1, WHILE THEY'RE
UNDER HYPNOSIS,


107
00:08:27.306 --> 00:08:29.808
THEY WILL DO NOTHING THEY
CONSIDER MORALLY WRONG.


108
00:08:29.809 --> 00:08:32.812
THEY WOULDN'T SHOOT
ANYBODY OR HURT ANYBODY.


109
00:08:32.812 --> 00:08:36.315
THEY ARE NOT ABLE
TO RESPOND TO SOMETHING THEY FEEL IS MORALLY WRONG.


110
00:08:36.315 --> 00:08:39.318
THEY MERELY IMAGINE WHATEVER
I TELL THEM IN A BIGGER WAY.


111
00:08:39.318 --> 00:08:41.320
ONE THING IS VERY IMPORTANT.

112
00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:44.323
NO DRINKING, NO TALKING,
NO CLINKING OF GLASSES.


113
00:08:44.323 --> 00:08:47.826
YOU'LL NOTICE NO ONE'S
ALLOWED TO SERVE DRINKS WHILE I PUT THEM UNDER.


114
00:08:47.827 --> 00:08:49.829
THEY MUST CONCENTRATE
ON THE SOUND OF MY VOICE.


115
00:08:49.829 --> 00:08:51.831
THEN WHEN THEY'RE UNDER,
WE CAN DO WHAT WE WANT.


116
00:08:51.831 --> 00:08:53.332
WE CAN HAVE FUN AND
ENJOY OURSELVES.


117
00:08:53.332 --> 00:08:56.335
SO, I WOULD
APPRECIATE COMPLETE SILENCE. THANK YOU.


118
00:08:56.335 --> 00:08:58.337
OK, BOYS, YOU'LL HEAR ONLY
THE SOUND OF MY VOICE.


119
00:08:58.838 --> 00:09:00.840
YOU'LL PUT YOUR
HANDS ON YOUR LEGS.


120
00:09:00.840 --> 00:09:04.343
YOU WILL CHOOSE A
SPOTLIGHT AND STARE AT THAT SPOTLIGHT.


121
00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:06.845
AT THE COUNT OF 10,
YOU'LL BE IN A DEEP SLEEP.


122
00:09:06.846 --> 00:09:08.347
YOU'LL HEAR ONLY THE
SOUND OF MY VOICE.


123
00:09:08.848 --> 00:09:09.849
READY?

124
00:09:09.849 --> 00:09:13.352
1. YOUR EYELIDS
ARE GETTING HEAVY.


125
00:09:13.352 --> 00:09:16.772
2. YOUR EYELIDS
ARE GETTING HEAVIER AND HEAVIER.


126
00:09:16.772 --> 00:09:18.857
3. YOUR EYELIDS
ARE ABOUT TO CLOSE.


127
00:09:19.358 --> 00:09:20.859
THEY FEEL VERY, VERY HEAVY.

128
00:09:20.860 --> 00:09:23.863
4, 5. YOUR EYES
ARE CLOSED.


129
00:09:23.863 --> 00:09:27.366
YOU'RE VERY RELAXED,
YOU'RE VERY RELAXED.


130
00:09:27.366 --> 00:09:31.370
6, 7. YOU HEAR ONLY
THE SOUND OF MY VOICE.


131
00:09:31.370 --> 00:09:33.872
ONLY THE SOUND OF MY VOICE.

132
00:09:34.373 --> 00:09:36.375
YOU'RE VERY RELAXED.
YOU CANNOT OPEN YOUR EYES.


133
00:09:36.375 --> 00:09:40.379
YOU WILL CONCENTRATE ONLY
ON THE SOUND OF MY VOICE.


134
00:09:40.379 --> 00:09:43.382
9, 10. YOU ARE
COMPLETELY ASLEEP.


135
00:09:43.382 --> 00:09:45.384
YOU ARE COMPLETELY ASLEEP.

136
00:09:45.384 --> 00:09:47.686
YOU HEAR ONLY THE
SOUND OF MY VOICE.


137
00:09:47.686 --> 00:09:49.387
ALL RIGHT, BOYS,
AT THE COUNT OF 3,


138
00:09:49.388 --> 00:09:51.890
YOU WILL RAISE
YOUR RIGHT HAND VERY TIGHT.


139
00:09:51.891 --> 00:09:53.893
SPREAD THE MUSCLES
IN YOUR FINGERS ON YOUR RIGHT HAND.


140
00:09:53.893 --> 00:09:55.394
YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE
TO BRING THEM DOWN.


141
00:09:55.394 --> 00:09:58.397
READY? 1, 2, 3.
RIGHT HANDS INTO THE AIR.


142
00:09:58.397 --> 00:09:59.898
FINGERS STIFF.
THERE'S NO WAY.


143
00:09:59.899 --> 00:10:01.901
TRY TO PUT YOUR
HANDS DOWN. YOU CANNOT.


144
00:10:01.901 --> 00:10:03.903
YOU CANNOT.
FINGERS STIFF AND SPREAD.


145
00:10:03.903 --> 00:10:05.905
YOU CANNOT PUT
YOUR HANDS DOWN.


146
00:10:05.905 --> 00:10:08.707
YOU'RE RELAXED AND HEAR
ONLY THE SOUND OF MY VOICE.


147
00:10:09.241 --> 00:10:11.910
SO INNOCENT IN THEIR SLEEP.
AREN'T THEY BEAUTIFUL? LOOK AT THESE GENTLEMEN.


148
00:10:12.328 --> 00:10:14.380
OK, LET'S HAVE SOME FUN.

00:10:17.917 --> 00:10:20.419
OK, GUYS,
PALMS DOWN.

YOU'RE IN A HOT PLACE,
A VERY HOT PLACE.


151
00:10:23.923 --> 00:10:25.424
YOU'RE IN THE

00:10:36.936 --> 00:10:39.939

163
00:10:58.457 --> 00:11:00.459

00:11:00.459 --> 00:11:02.461
YOU'RE INSIDE
A BIG, GIANT REFRIGERATOR,


165
00:11:02.962 --> 00:11:05.464

166
00:11:08.968 --> 00:11:10.970
IT'S COLD.

167
00:11:10.970 --> 00:11:13.472
YOU'VE NEVER

174
00:12:14.533 --> 00:12:15.534

00:12:15.534 --> 00:12:18.537
FINE. I JUST SAW
A LOT OF COLORS AND STUFF LIKE THAT.

182
00:12:27.546 --> 00:12:28.547
I GOT IT.

183
00:13:46.830 --> 00:13:48.331

00:14:07.851 --> 00:14:08.852
WELL, WHAT'S WRONG?

192
00:14:08.852 --> 00:14:10.854
I DON'T KNOW. I GOT
A LITTLE HEADACHE, THAT'S ALL.


193
00:14:11.354 --> 00:14:13.356
MAYBE A LITTLE
TOO MUCH BEER.


194
00:14:15.859 --> 00:14:17.360
I THINK WE'D
BETTER GO HOME.


195
00:14:17.861 --> 00:14:18.862
I SAID IT'S JUST
A HEADACHE.


196
00:14:18.862 --> 00:14:20.864
ALL RIGHT, I'M

201
00:15:30.433 --> 00:15:34.437
THAT'S GREAT,'CAUSE I'VE

202
00:15:35.939 --> 00:15:38.942

00:15:47.951 --> 00:15:49.452
HEY.

208

EVERYTHING'S OK?


209
00:15:54.958 --> 00:15:56.459
YEAH, I'M SURE.

210
00:15:57.460 --> 00:15:59.962
LET'S JUST

211
00:16:00.964 --> 00:16:01.965

00:16:42.756 --> 00:16:45.008

227
00:17:44.567 --> 00:17:46.068
HEY, MAN,

YOU CAN TELL ME. NOW
WHAT'S JAMMING YOU UP?


230
00:17:50.573 --> 00:17:51.574
I DON'T KNOW.

231
00:17:51.574 --> 00:17:53.576
WHAT YOU MEAN
YOU DON'T KNOW?


232
00:17:54.077 --> 00:17:56.079
LATELY I'VE BEEN

233
00:17:56.079 --> 00:17:58.581
I MEAN, LIKE, ALL

235
00:18:00.083 --> 00:18:01.751
I'VE BEEN GETTING 'EM
FOR ABOUT A WEEK NOW.


236
00:18:02.085 --> 00:18:03.586
I'M TURNING INTO
AN ASPIRIN JUNKIE.


237
00:18:03.586 --> 00:18:05.087
OH, MAN, SOUNDS

238
00:18:06.373 --> 00:18:08.591
HEY, YOU GOT A HEAVY
LOAD AT SCHOOL,


239
00:18:08.591 --> 00:18:10.593
AND YOU'RE DRIVING
THAT CAB IN BETWEEN.


240
00:18:10.593 --> 00:18:12.094
THAT'S BOUND TO GET TO YOU.

241
00:18:14.097 --> 00:18:16.599
MAYBE I GOT HIGH
BLOOD PRESSURE


242
00:18:16.599 --> 00:18:19.551
OR, UH, OR

243
00:18:19.552 --> 00:18:20.436
HYPERTENSION.

00:18:20.437 --> 00:18:22.105
TENSION.

245
00:18:23.106 --> 00:18:24.607
YEAH.

246
00:18:24.607 --> 00:18:26.108
MAYBE I OUGHT TO
SEE A DOCTOR.


247
00:18:27.610 --> 00:18:28.611
WELL, LOOK.

248
00:18:28.611 --> 00:18:31.113
THERE'S A BROTHER HERE
NAMED DR. CALDWELL.


249
00:18:31.114 --> 00:18:32.615
I'LL ASK HIM TO
CHECK YOU OUT.


250
00:18:32.615 --> 00:18:35.618
BUT I BET YOU HE TELLS
YOU THE SAME THING I'M SAYING TO YOU.


251
00:18:35.618 --> 00:18:38.120
MAN, YOU'RE WORKING
TOO HARD.


252
00:18:38.621 --> 00:18:40.072
CALL HIM, OK?

253
00:18:43.126 --> 00:18:44.627
SAY, IKE.

254
00:18:44.627 --> 00:18:46.578
YOU WANT THAT UH,
STRAWBERRY CREAM PIE?


255
00:18:48.631 --> 00:18:49.632
HMM?

256
00:20:26.949 --> 00:20:28.951
IKE.
HMM?


257
00:20:28.951 --> 00:20:30.953
WHERE DID YOU
GET THIS?


258
00:20:31.954 --> 00:20:35.457
A LITTLE OL'
SECONDHAND SHOP OVER ON, UH...


259
00:20:35.457 --> 00:20:36.458
YOU LIKE IT?

260
00:20:36.458 --> 00:20:38.460
OH, SURE, BUT WHAT
ARE YOU GONNA DO WITH IT?


261
00:20:38.460 --> 00:20:41.463
I MEAN IT'S NOT
EXACTLY YOU, IF YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.


262
00:20:42.464 --> 00:20:43.965
I'M SORRY.

263
00:20:43.966 --> 00:20:45.467
IT'S COOL.

264
00:22:24.566 --> 00:22:26.234
YOU'RE PERFECTLY HEALTHY.

265
00:22:26.568 --> 00:22:29.571
YOU DON'T HAVE
HYPERTENSION OR HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE.


266
00:22:29.571 --> 00:22:30.572
AS FOR THOSE HEADACHES,

267
00:22:30.572 --> 00:22:33.074
THEY'RE PROBABLY
EMOTIONAL.


268
00:22:33.075 --> 00:22:35.911
ALL I CAN RECOMMEND
IS THAT YOU LAY BACK ON THE STUDIES A BIT,


269
00:22:35.911 --> 00:22:39.080
AND ON THE JOB.
MAYBE MEDITATE.


270
00:22:39.081 --> 00:22:40.082
SMOKE SOME WEED.

271
00:22:40.082 --> 00:22:41.583
AND IF THE HEADACHES
COME BACK,


272
00:22:42.084 --> 00:22:43.585
YOU COME BACK, AND
WE'LL CHECK FURTHER,


273
00:22:43.585 --> 00:22:45.370
BUT I DON'T THINK
THERE'S ANY PROBLEM.


274
00:22:46.088 --> 00:22:48.373
NOTHING PHYSICAL?

275
00:22:48.373 --> 00:22:52.009
IKE, DON'T LET
THAT MIND OF YOURS PLAY TRICKS ON YOU.


276
00:22:52.010 --> 00:22:54.095
YOU'RE A PERFECTLY
NORMAL YOUNG MAN


277
00:22:54.096 --> 00:22:58.266
WHO'S BURNING THE
CANDLE AT BOTH ENDS, THAT'S ALL.


278
00:23:21.623 --> 00:23:24.626
IT DON'T GO DOWN
THAT WAY, AND SHE KNOWS IT.


279
00:23:24.626 --> 00:23:26.127
AND SHE'S MESSING

280
00:23:26.128 --> 00:23:28.130
AND NO ONE MESSES
WITH ENOCH LAND.


281
00:23:29.131 --> 00:23:30.132
YOU HEAR ME?

282
00:23:30.132 --> 00:23:32.134

283
00:23:32.134 --> 00:23:35.637

284
00:23:35.637 --> 00:23:37.639
OR I'M GONNA GO

285
00:23:37.639 --> 00:23:40.141
AND GET INTO
IT WITH HER. YOU DIG IT?


286
00:23:41.643 --> 00:23:42.644
HOMEBOY!

287
00:23:42.761 --> 00:23:43.645

303
00:24:18.680 --> 00:24:21.883
MAN, WITH YOUR CABS

304
00:24:22.184 --> 00:24:23.685
AND IT'S A PERCENTAGE
GAME, YOU KNOW.


305
00:24:23.685 --> 00:24:25.186
YOU GET A GOOD PIECE

306
00:24:25.187 --> 00:24:27.189
NO, NO, ENOCH,

307
00:24:29.191 --> 00:24:31.693
UH, I JUST WANT TO
PUT SOME MONEY ON A NUMBER.


308
00:24:31.693 --> 00:24:33.194
THAT'S ALL.

309
00:24:33.195 --> 00:24:35.697
LOOK A-HERE,
LOOK A-HERE.


310
00:24:35.697 --> 00:24:38.700
MY MAN DECIDED
TO GET DOWN.


311
00:24:38.700 --> 00:24:40.702
DO YOU KNOW I'VE BEEN
WANTING YOU TO PLAY


312
00:24:40.702 --> 00:24:42.704

UH, UH, A $1.


314
00:24:44.706 --> 00:24:46.207

GOOD DOING BUSINESS

317
00:24:49.711 --> 00:24:52.714
YOU KNOW IT AIN'T
STEERIN', BUT THE NUMBERS IS A GOOD START.


318
00:24:52.714 --> 00:24:54.215
WHAT YOU WANT?

319
00:24:55.217 --> 00:24:56.718
OH, UH...

321
00:24:58.720 --> 00:24:59.721
MM
-HMM.

322
00:25:00.722 --> 00:25:02.223
LIKE I SAID, BLOOD,

323
00:25:02.724 --> 00:25:04.726
GOOD PLEASURE DOING
BUSINESS WITH YOU.


324
00:25:04.726 --> 00:25:07.428
YES, SIR.
WHAT YOU SAY?


325
00:25:15.737 --> 00:25:17.238
AHA. HERE'S
A GOOD ONE--


326
00:25:18.740 --> 00:25:20.742
"REVIEW BOARDS ARE
GENERALLY CALLED UPON


327
00:25:20.742 --> 00:25:23.244
"TO ACT IN CASES
INVOLVING WHAT?"


328
00:25:33.755 --> 00:25:35.757
UH, CASES...

329
00:25:35.757 --> 00:25:39.260
CASES THAT APPEAL
TO A LOWER COURT


330
00:25:39.761 --> 00:25:41.262
THAT, UH...

331
00:25:45.767 --> 00:25:47.602
DADDY'S DOING YOU GOOD.

ISAAC, YOU IN THERE?

335
00:26:04.786 --> 00:26:06.287
UH...

00:26:06.288 --> 00:26:07.789
SURE.

337
00:26:07.789 --> 00:26:08.790
YEAH.

338
00:26:09.791 --> 00:26:10.792
LISTEN.

339
00:26:17.299 --> 00:26:18.800
BABY, MY HEAD
IS KILLING ME.


340
00:26:18.800 --> 00:26:20.301
OH.

341
00:26:24.306 --> 00:26:26.808
OOH, YOUR NECK IS
AS HARD AS A ROCK.


342
00:26:30.812 --> 00:26:32.313
I BETTER TAKE
SOME ASPIRIN.


343
00:26:32.314 --> 00:26:33.815
WHAT YOU NEED IS
A LITTLE WINE


344
00:26:33.815 --> 00:26:35.316
TO KIND OF
LOOSEN YOU UP


345
00:26:35.317 --> 00:26:37.319
AND GET RID OF
ALL THAT TENSION.


346
00:26:37.819 --> 00:26:38.820
IKE.

347
00:27:00.342 --> 00:27:02.177
HOW YOU DOING, BABY?

348
00:27:02.596 --> 00:27:03.597
YOU SHOULD
GET SOME SLEEP.


349
00:27:03.597 --> 00:27:06.099
AND YOU'LL FEEL
BETTER IN THE MORNING.


350
00:27:28.121 --> 00:27:29.122
OH, HEY.

351
00:27:29.122 --> 00:27:31.624
WHAT HAPPENED
TO YOUR HEADACHE?


352
00:27:34.127 --> 00:27:35.628
IT'S GONE.

353
00:27:35.629 --> 00:27:37.130
OH, GREAT.

354
00:27:42.135 --> 00:27:43.136
HEY.

355
00:27:50.644 --> 00:27:52.145
OH, THAT'S NICE.

TAKE YOU ON A
LONG RIDE, GIRL.


357
00:28:12.666 --> 00:28:14.167
LET ME TAKE YOU

358
00:28:27.681 --> 00:28:29.182
HEY. AAH!

00:28:30.684 --> 00:28:32.686

00:28:34.688 --> 00:28:36.690
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

361
00:28:39.693 --> 00:28:42.078
DADDY AIN'T GONNA

362
00:29:34.247 --> 00:29:36.249
OH, GOD!

MAN, COME ON.

368
00:29:56.770 --> 00:29:57.854
GOD.

369
00:30:00.774 --> 00:30:02.275
COME ON, NOW.

370
00:30:02.776 --> 00:30:03.777

00:30:15.288 --> 00:30:16.505
DADDY'S DOING YOU

373
00:30:16.506 --> 00:30:17.290
GOOD!

00:30:21.294 --> 00:30:22.795
IKE!

375
00:30:25.799 --> 00:30:26.800
OH, MY GOD!

376
00:30:58.298 --> 00:31:02.835
CHAMPION OF GOD, 
THE REVEREND ELIJA BLISS.

377
00:31:04.838 --> 00:31:09.342
SATAN, WHO IS WHITE, 
IS AN EVIL SPIRIT,

378
00:31:09.342 --> 00:31:11.844
IS DARK AND ENGULFS
ALL OF US


379
00:31:11.845 --> 00:31:13.346
WITH HIS WICKED WAYS.

380
00:31:13.847 --> 00:31:17.016
HE IS THE PRINCE
OF DARKNESS.


381
00:31:17.017 --> 00:31:19.352
WE MUST NOT LET SATAN
COME INTO OUR HOUSE.


382
00:31:48.381 --> 00:31:50.383
WHAT ARE YOU TRYING TO DO?

383
00:31:50.383 --> 00:31:51.884
STOP IT!

384
00:31:54.387 --> 00:31:55.271

386
00:31:58.858 --> 00:32:00.392
WHAT ARE YOU

387
00:32:03.897 --> 00:32:04.898
STOP!

388
00:32:07.567 --> 00:32:08.901
WILL YOU STOP?

389
00:32:10.403 --> 00:32:12.405
OH, PLEASE!

00:32:12.405 --> 00:32:13.406
HELP ME!

391
00:32:55.949 --> 00:32:58.451
OH, MY GOD!

392
00:32:58.451 --> 00:33:00.953
COME ON, GET
THE FUCK OUT OF MY GODDAMN CAR!


393
00:33:00.954 --> 00:33:02.455
PLEASE DON'T KILL ME.

394
00:33:02.455 --> 00:33:03.956
KILL YOU? BITCH,
GET OFF OF ME.


395
00:33:04.457 --> 00:33:06.959
WHAT THE FUCK'S
WRONG WITH YOU? IS YOU CRAZY? HA!


396
00:34:18.031 --> 00:34:19.032
J.D. WALKER.

397
00:34:19.332 --> 00:34:21.534
HOW THE HELL...

398
00:34:21.534 --> 00:34:23.536
WHAT KIND OF DRESSING DO YOU WANT?

399
00:34:24.621 --> 00:34:25.538
ROQUEFORT.

400
00:34:25.538 --> 00:34:27.039
HUH?

401
00:34:29.042 --> 00:34:30.043
ROQUEFORT.

402
00:34:56.569 --> 00:34:59.572
YOU WANNA CUT DOWN
ON YOUR HOURS UNTIL EXAMS ARE OVER?


403
00:34:59.572 --> 00:35:03.075
HENDRICKS, DO YOU
REALIZE HOW SHORTHANDED I AM?


404
00:35:03.076 --> 00:35:05.578
3 GUYS QUIT ON ME IN
THE LAST 2 MONTHS.


405
00:35:05.578 --> 00:35:07.580
GASOLINE HAS GONE UP

406
00:35:07.580 --> 00:35:10.082
LOOK, RALPH,I DIDN'T
MEAN TO CAUSE YOU ANY PROBLEMS, I JUST THOUGHT--


407
00:35:10.083 --> 00:35:13.086
PROBLEMS? YOU DON'T
KNOW THE HALF OF IT!


408
00:35:13.086 --> 00:35:14.587
INSURANCE IS GOING
UP THIS MONTH,


409
00:35:14.587 --> 00:35:16.088
THIS PLACE IS
FALLING TO PIECES,


410
00:35:16.089 --> 00:35:18.591
AND TO TOP IT ALL
OFF, THE COPS CAME BY.


411
00:35:18.591 --> 00:35:21.093
SEEMS THIS WOMAN IS
LAID UP IN THE HOSPITAL.


412
00:35:21.094 --> 00:35:23.096
SHE CLAIMS THAT ONE OF THE
DRIVERS ROUGHED HER UP,


413
00:35:23.096 --> 00:35:25.214
BEAT HER UP IN
ONE OF MY CABS.


414
00:35:25.214 --> 00:35:27.619
ALL SHE CAN REMEMBER
IS THAT IT WAS A BLACK GUY.


415
00:35:27.620 --> 00:35:30.623
WELL, I GOT 30 GUYS
WORKING FOR ME THAT FIT THAT DESCRIPTION,


416
00:35:30.623 --> 00:35:33.959
BUT THAT'LL MAKE
THE INSURANCE PREMIUMS GO UP, SURE AS HELL.


417
00:35:33.960 --> 00:35:37.630
THE BODY SHOP
CALLED SAYING I OWE MONEY ON 3 CABS


418
00:35:37.964 --> 00:35:39.632
THAT THEY FIXED
IN ONE MONTH.


419
00:35:39.632 --> 00:35:42.017
EVERYBODY SAY, "AMEN."

420
00:35:42.018 --> 00:35:43.636
EVERYBODY SAY, "AMEN!"

421
00:35:43.636 --> 00:35:45.137
AMEN!

422
00:35:45.137 --> 00:35:47.139
EVERYBODY SAY AMEN!

423
00:35:47.139 --> 00:35:49.141
MURDERER!

424
00:35:49.141 --> 00:35:50.642
MURDERER!

425
00:35:51.644 --> 00:35:53.646
MURDERER!

426
00:35:55.648 --> 00:35:57.650
WE MUST BE VIGILANT!

427
00:35:57.650 --> 00:35:59.652
WE MUST BE WATCHFUL!

428
00:36:01.654 --> 00:36:04.657
WE MUST NOT LET SATAN
COME INTO OUR HOUSE!


429
00:36:05.658 --> 00:36:07.159
I GOT TO GET
MORE COMFORTABLE


430
00:36:07.660 --> 00:36:10.162
BECAUSE I FEEL THE
SPIRIT IN THIS HOUSE.


431
00:36:10.162 --> 00:36:12.664
I FEEL THE SPIRIT
IN THIS HOUSE NOW!


432
00:36:12.665 --> 00:36:14.166
CAN YOU FEEL IT?

433
00:36:14.166 --> 00:36:15.167
I CAN FEEL IT!

434
00:36:16.168 --> 00:36:17.669
I CAN FEEL IT!

435
00:36:18.170 --> 00:36:19.171
I CAN FEEL IT!

436
00:36:19.305 --> 00:36:22.174
IT STARTS IN MY HEAD!

437
00:36:22.174 --> 00:36:25.677
AND IT STARTS TO MOVE
ON DOWN TO MY STOMACH!


438
00:36:25.845 --> 00:36:29.181
AND IT MAKES ME FEEL
ALL GOOD INSIDE!


439
00:36:29.682 --> 00:36:32.184
IT FILLS THAT VOID!

440
00:36:32.184 --> 00:36:36.188
THAT, THAT EMPTY
SPACE RIGHT HERE IN MY GUT!


441
00:36:36.188 --> 00:36:39.691
I SAY THE SPIRIT,
THE SPIRIT DOES THAT!


442
00:36:39.692 --> 00:36:42.244
WE ALL CAN FEEL A
PART OF THAT JOY!


443
00:36:42.244 --> 00:36:46.197
WE ALL CAN
FEEL A PART OF HIS WONDROUS LOVE!


444
00:36:46.198 --> 00:36:49.201
ALL YOU'VE GOT
TO DO IS GET IN TOUCH WITH IT


445
00:36:49.201 --> 00:36:51.203
AND GO WITH IT!

446
00:36:51.704 --> 00:36:53.706
GO WITH IT
AND FEEL HIS JOY!


447
00:36:54.206 --> 00:36:57.709
GO WITH IT, AND FEEL
A PART OF GOD!


448
00:36:57.710 --> 00:37:00.713
AND YOU'VE GOT
YOUR NEGATIVE FORCES ON THE ROPES!


449
00:37:00.713 --> 00:37:02.214
GOING DOWN FOR THE COUNT!

450
00:37:03.215 --> 00:37:05.717
ONLY A MATTER OF TIME

451
00:37:05.718 --> 00:37:09.221
BEFORE GOD IS IN
YOUR CORNER GOING TO BLOWS FOR YOU!


452
00:37:10.222 --> 00:37:11.723
IT'S ONLY A
MATTER OF TIME


453
00:37:12.224 --> 00:37:14.226
BEFORE SADNESS AND SICKNESS

00:37:14.226 --> 00:37:17.229

00:38:00.773 --> 00:38:01.774
VICTORY!

472
00:38:02.775 --> 00:38:04.276
HA HA HA HA!

473
00:38:04.777 --> 00:38:06.779
AND WITH THE HOLY HELP

474
00:38:06.779 --> 00:38:08.781
OF THE HOLY SPIRIT,

475
00:38:08.781 --> 00:38:11.283
I FOUGHT MY WAY BACK!

476
00:38:11.283 --> 00:38:15.287
YES, I SAID
I FOUGHT MY WAY BACK


477
00:38:15.287 --> 00:38:18.290
AGAINST THE EVILS
AND THE DEMONS,


478
00:38:18.290 --> 00:38:20.292
AND NOW I AM VICTORIOUS!

479
00:38:21.293 --> 00:38:23.261
I AM VICTORIOUS!

480
00:38:23.262 --> 00:38:24.296
WITH THE HELP

481
00:38:24.797 --> 00:38:26.799
AND THE GRACE OF GOD,

482
00:38:26.799 --> 00:38:28.300
JUST SAY, "AMEN," NOW!

483
00:38:28.300 --> 00:38:29.301
AMEN!

484
00:38:29.301 --> 00:38:30.802
JUST SAY, "AMEN!"

485
00:38:30.803 --> 00:38:33.806
YOU'RE A FAKE, A
PHONY! YOU WASN'T EVEN A DECENT FIGHTER!


486
00:38:33.806 --> 00:38:35.307
YOU'RE A FAKE!

487
00:38:36.809 --> 00:38:38.310
LET THE POOR SOUL GO.

488
00:38:38.310 --> 00:38:39.311
LET HIM GO!

489
00:38:40.863 --> 00:38:43.315
THIS MAN'S GOT
ENOUGH CHAINS.


490
00:38:47.820 --> 00:38:49.321
COME.

491
00:38:52.324 --> 00:38:53.825
YOU SEE THIS POOR SOUL?

492
00:38:56.328 --> 00:38:58.163
THIS IS YOU AND ME.

493
00:39:01.333 --> 00:39:03.635
ELIJA, ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

494
00:39:03.636 --> 00:39:04.837
GET HIM OUT OF HERE.

495
00:39:07.840 --> 00:39:08.841
LIAR!

496
00:39:09.341 --> 00:39:10.342
LIAR!

497
00:39:10.342 --> 00:39:11.343
YOUNG MAN.

00:39:12.845 --> 00:39:13.846
YOUNG MAN!

499
00:39:20.352 --> 00:39:21.853
THANK YOU.

500
00:39:21.854 --> 00:39:23.856
I DON'T KNOW
YOUR NAME.


501
00:39:23.856 --> 00:39:24.857
IKE.

502
00:39:25.357 --> 00:39:27.242
ISAAC HENDRICKS.

503
00:39:27.243 --> 00:39:28.861
ISAAC.

504
00:39:28.861 --> 00:39:30.863
THIS IS MY
DAUGHTER, ROBERTA


505
00:39:30.863 --> 00:39:32.865
AND MY
BROTHER, THEOTIS.


506
00:39:32.865 --> 00:39:34.867
I HOPE YOU COME
BACK AGAIN. I...


507
00:39:35.417 --> 00:39:37.869
I FEEL I KNOW YOU.

508
00:39:37.870 --> 00:39:39.872
PERHAPS OUR SOULS
ARE CONNECTED.


509
00:39:42.374 --> 00:39:43.875
I WILL.

510
00:39:44.376 --> 00:39:45.877
I WILL COME
BACK VERY SOON.


511
00:39:46.879 --> 00:39:48.380
I HOPE SO...

512
00:39:48.380 --> 00:39:49.381
ISAAC.

513
00:39:50.382 --> 00:39:51.883
GOOD NAME.

514
00:39:52.384 --> 00:39:53.885
THE CAR'S WAITING.

515
00:39:53.886 --> 00:39:55.888
SEE YOU AGAIN SOON, IKE.

516
00:40:34.927 --> 00:40:36.929
GOOD-BYE, CHILDREN.
GOOD-BYE, CHILDREN.


517
00:40:53.445 --> 00:40:54.446
BYE
-BYE.

518
00:40:54.446 --> 00:40:55.780
SAME TO YOU.

519
00:43:08.785 --> 00:43:10.787
YOU SAID YOU WAS GONNA LEAVE ELIJA.

520
00:43:11.154 --> 00:43:12.288
YOU'RE A FOOL.

521
00:43:12.789 --> 00:43:13.790
YOU WAS COMIN' WITH ME!

522
00:43:13.790 --> 00:43:15.291
HOW MUCH MONEY?

523
00:43:15.291 --> 00:43:16.792
MORE THAN ELIJA
GIVES YOU.


524
00:43:16.793 --> 00:43:18.294
OH, COME ON .

525
00:43:18.294 --> 00:43:20.796
YOU COULD NEVER
GIVE ME WHAT ELIJA GIVES ME.


526
00:43:20.797 --> 00:43:22.799
AND IF YOU DON'T STOP,

527
00:43:22.799 --> 00:43:25.301
I'LL TELL HIM THAT
BABY ISN'T HIS.


528
00:43:26.836 --> 00:43:29.305
AND HE'LL KICK YOU
OUT IN THE STREET.


529
00:43:29.472 --> 00:43:30.806
I  F YOU DO,
I'LL KILL YOU.


530
00:43:30.807 --> 00:43:32.308
YOU FOOL.

531
00:43:55.198 --> 00:43:56.782
OH, GOD!

532
00:44:44.380 --> 00:44:46.882
IKE, I WAS SO
WORRIED ABOUT YOU.


533
00:44:49.385 --> 00:44:50.886
YOU'RE DRUNK.

534
00:44:50.887 --> 00:44:52.388
WHY?

535
00:44:54.057 --> 00:44:56.392
I CALLED UP THE
GARAGE. NOBODY KNEW WHERE YOU WERE.


536
00:44:56.392 --> 00:44:58.394
I THOUGHT YOU
HAD AN ACCIDENT OR SOMETHING.


537
00:44:58.394 --> 00:45:00.396
YOU COULD HAVE
CALLED TO SAY YOU WERE OK.


538
00:45:00.396 --> 00:45:01.397
BITCH!

539
00:45:01.898 --> 00:45:02.899
I HATE YOU.

540
00:45:03.399 --> 00:45:05.901
QUIT FLAPPIN'
YOUR GODDAMN GUMS.


541
00:45:05.902 --> 00:45:06.903
NO!

542
00:45:10.907 --> 00:45:12.909
WHAT THE HELL
IS THE MATTER WITH YOU?


543
00:45:14.410 --> 00:45:16.412
ARE YOU CRAZY?

544
00:45:16.913 --> 00:45:20.416
HOW DARE YOU TALK TO ME
LIKE I'M SOME KIND OF COMMON SISSIFIED NIGGER WIMP.


545
00:45:20.416 --> 00:45:21.417
WHAT IS THIS
SHIT, ANYWAY?


546
00:45:21.918 --> 00:45:22.919
AIN'T NOBODY TALK
TO ME LIKE THAT,


547
00:45:22.919 --> 00:45:25.421
ESPECIALLY NO BITCH
HO LIKE YOU!


548
00:45:25.421 --> 00:45:26.922
TEACH YOU TO
FUCK WITH ME!


549
00:45:26.923 --> 00:45:30.259
I OUGHT TO PUT
YOUR ASS OUT IN THE GODDAMN STREET.


550
00:45:32.428 --> 00:45:33.929
YOU'RE CRAZY.

551
00:45:33.930 --> 00:45:35.431
GET--

552
00:45:35.932 --> 00:45:36.933
GET--

553
00:45:39.435 --> 00:45:41.937
TEACH HER TO FUCK
WITH ME. HA HA.


554
00:45:41.938 --> 00:45:43.439
GODDAMN HER!

555
00:45:45.441 --> 00:45:46.942
SILLY
-ASS HO! HMMPH.

556
00:45:53.950 --> 00:45:55.451
SILLY
-ASS BITCH!

00:46:01.457 --> 00:46:02.958

00:46:04.961 --> 00:46:06.963
STOP FUCKIN' WITH ME!

559
00:46:30.987 --> 00:46:32.989
CHRIS...HONEY...

560
00:46:35.491 --> 00:46:38.994
I DON'T REMEMBER DOING
ANY OF THOSE THINGS.


561
00:46:38.995 --> 00:46:40.997
I WOKE UP THIS MORNING,
YOU WERE GONE.


562
00:46:42.498 --> 00:46:44.500
YOU DON'T REMEMBER?

563
00:46:44.500 --> 00:46:47.002
WELL, THAT'S FUNNY,
BECAUSE, UH...


564
00:46:47.003 --> 00:46:49.005
YOU WERE SO DRUNK

565
00:46:49.005 --> 00:46:51.507
I'M SURPRISED YOU EVEN
REMEMBER YOUR NAME.


566
00:46:54.010 --> 00:46:55.511
IKE, YOU, UH...

567
00:46:57.013 --> 00:46:58.014
YOU BEAT ME UP.

568
00:46:59.515 --> 00:47:01.016
YOU CURSED ME...

569
00:47:03.019 --> 00:47:05.221
AND YOU THREW ME OUT
OF THE APARTMENT.


570
00:47:05.221 --> 00:47:06.522
CHRIS...

571
00:47:07.523 --> 00:47:10.526
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO SAY.


572
00:47:10.526 --> 00:47:13.529
I DON'T SEE HOW
I COULD-- OH, OH, HONEY, LISTEN...


573
00:47:15.531 --> 00:47:16.532
I'M SORRY.

574
00:47:18.034 --> 00:47:19.535
PLEASE FORGIVE ME.

575
00:47:33.049 --> 00:47:35.051
SHE WON'T TALK TO YOU?

576
00:47:38.554 --> 00:47:40.055
YEAH.

577
00:47:40.056 --> 00:47:41.057
SHE BLEW IN LAST NIGHT

578
00:47:41.057 --> 00:47:43.559
LIKE SHE HAD THE
DEVIL ON HER TAIL.


579
00:47:44.060 --> 00:47:45.561
SHE WAS ALL HYSTERICAL.

580
00:47:45.561 --> 00:47:47.563
TOOK HOURS TO
CALM HER DOWN.


581
00:47:47.563 --> 00:47:49.064
I'M FLIPPIN' OUT.

582
00:47:53.069 --> 00:47:55.071
I'M FUCKIN'
FLIPPIN' OUT.


583
00:47:55.571 --> 00:47:57.072
I DON'T EVEN REMEMBER.

584
00:48:00.576 --> 00:48:02.578
MAYBE I SHOULD
SEE A SHRINK.


585
00:48:05.581 --> 00:48:06.582
I MEAN, I'M
CRACKIN' UP, MAN.


586
00:48:06.582 --> 00:48:08.083
I BLACKED OUT.

587
00:48:08.084 --> 00:48:10.086
AW, MAN, YOU DON'T
NEED NO SHRINK,


588
00:48:10.086 --> 00:48:11.087
AND YOU AIN'T
CRACKIN' UP.


589
00:48:11.087 --> 00:48:12.588
NOW, YOU UNDER
A LOT OF PRESSURE,


590
00:48:12.588 --> 00:48:14.089
AND LAST NIGHT YOU
GOT YOUR HEAD BAD


591
00:48:14.090 --> 00:48:15.541
AND LET OFF SOME STEAM.

592
00:48:15.541 --> 00:48:16.758
THAT'S BULLSHIT.

593
00:48:16.759 --> 00:48:19.595
HEY, IKE, CHRISTELLA
IS GONNA BE BACK, MAN.


594
00:48:24.100 --> 00:48:25.101
I THINK IT'S
A GOOD THING


595
00:48:25.101 --> 00:48:26.602
TO GO UPSIDE OF
A WOMAN'S HEAD


596
00:48:26.602 --> 00:48:27.603
WHEN SHE STARTS
HANDING YOU LIP.


597
00:48:28.104 --> 00:48:30.106
I MEAN, BELIEVE IT OR
NOT, THEY LIKE THAT.


598
00:48:30.106 --> 00:48:31.607
HEY, MAN,
HONEST TO GOD.


599
00:48:32.108 --> 00:48:34.610
I MEAN, YOU HAVE GOT
TO GO INTO YOUR NIGGER ACT ON 'EM


600
00:48:34.610 --> 00:48:35.611
EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE.

601
00:48:35.611 --> 00:48:37.112
THEY GONNA PUSH
YOU TILL YOU DO.


602
00:48:37.113 --> 00:48:40.116
THEY WANT YOU
TO SHOW THEM WHERE THE LINES ARE.


603
00:48:40.116 --> 00:48:41.617
YOU KNOW SOMETHING, MAN?

604
00:48:41.617 --> 00:48:45.120
IT'S PRETTY ENCOURAGING
THAT YOU DID WHAT YOU DID.


605
00:48:45.121 --> 00:48:48.124
NOW...AS LONG AS
I'VE KNOWN YOU,


606
00:48:48.624 --> 00:48:50.125
YOU'VE ALWAYS
SEEMED TO BE,


607
00:48:50.126 --> 00:48:51.627
YOU KNOW,
SORTA REPRESSED.


608
00:48:51.627 --> 00:48:53.128
WELL, LAST NIGHT,
YOU GOT TOW UP


609
00:48:53.129 --> 00:48:54.497
AND LET IT ALL OUT.

610
00:48:54.497 --> 00:48:56.131
NOW, THAT'S
FANTASTIC, MAN.


611
00:48:58.634 --> 00:49:00.135
I DON'T KNOW.

612
00:49:02.138 --> 00:49:03.139
I DO KNOW...

613
00:49:04.140 --> 00:49:06.642
THAT MY BABY SAYS
I BEAT HER UP,


614
00:49:07.643 --> 00:49:10.145
AND I DON'T
EVEN REMEMBER.


615
00:49:10.146 --> 00:49:12.648
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.
SHE'S GONNA BE BACK.


616
00:49:15.651 --> 00:49:18.654
CHRIS, YOUR FOLKS ARE REALLY WORRIED ABOUT YOU.

617
00:49:18.654 --> 00:49:21.156
THEY CALLED AND ASKED
ME TO TALK TO YOU.


618
00:49:21.657 --> 00:49:23.659
THIS GUY COULD
BE DANGEROUS.


619
00:49:23.659 --> 00:49:26.161
IKE IS NOT DANGEROUS.

620
00:49:26.162 --> 00:49:29.165
NOW, HE IS GOING
THROUGH A THING.


621
00:49:29.165 --> 00:49:31.167
HE NEEDS TIME TO GET
HIS HEAD TOGETHER.


622
00:49:31.167 --> 00:49:33.169
SO DO I. THAT'S
WHY I LEFT.


623
00:49:33.669 --> 00:49:36.171
YOU DON'T CALL
THAT DANGEROUS?


624
00:49:36.172 --> 00:49:38.674
THIS LOOKS WORSE
THAN IT IS.


625
00:49:38.674 --> 00:49:40.676
I THOUGHT YOU DIDN'T
LIKE VIOLENT CATS


626
00:49:40.676 --> 00:49:42.177
I THOUGHT THAT
TURNED YOUR STOMACH.


627
00:49:45.681 --> 00:49:47.182
I DON'T UNDERSTAND YOU.

628
00:49:47.183 --> 00:49:49.185
NOW, LET'S NOT START
IN ON THAT, OK, CARL?


629
00:49:49.185 --> 00:49:50.186
BECAUSE IT WASN'T
ABOUT THAT.


630
00:49:50.186 --> 00:49:51.187
THEN WHAT WAS
IT ABOUT?


631
00:49:52.188 --> 00:49:53.689
NOW, LOOK,

632
00:49:53.689 --> 00:49:56.191
MY PARENTS DIDN'T
CALL YOU BECAUSE YOU'RE A FRIEND.


633
00:49:56.192 --> 00:49:59.695
THEY CALLED
YOU BECAUSE YOU ARE A COP.


634
00:49:59.695 --> 00:50:02.147
THEY BLEW THIS
WHOLE THING OUT OF PROPORTION.


635
00:50:03.199 --> 00:50:06.202
NOW, YOUR BEING
MY EX-HUSBAND


636
00:50:06.202 --> 00:50:09.705
DOESN'T GIVE YOU
ANY RIGHT TO COME BACK INTO MY LIFE.


637
00:50:10.206 --> 00:50:12.708
I TOLD THEM I WOULD
KEEP AN EYE ON IKE.


638
00:50:16.212 --> 00:50:18.714
ALL RIGHT,
IT'S FOR YOU.


639
00:50:18.714 --> 00:50:21.216
YOU JUST DON'T STOP
LOVING SOMEONE.


640
00:50:24.720 --> 00:50:27.723
I WANT TO MAKE SURE HE'S
AS COOL AS YOU THINK.


641
00:50:28.724 --> 00:50:29.725
OK?

642
00:50:40.455 --> 00:50:43.541
GIRL, WOULD YOU
STOP THINKING ABOUT THAT MAN?


643
00:50:43.541 --> 00:50:44.959
I CAN'T HELP
IT, PHYLLIS.


644
00:50:44.959 --> 00:50:47.461
IT WON'T DO
YOU ANY GOOD.


645
00:50:47.462 --> 00:50:48.463
I KNOW.

646
00:50:56.471 --> 00:50:57.972
CHRIS!

647
00:50:57.972 --> 00:50:58.973
UH...

648
00:51:00.975 --> 00:51:02.476
HOW YOU
DOING, BABY?


649
00:51:03.978 --> 00:51:04.979
OH.

650
00:51:06.481 --> 00:51:08.483
SPEAK OF THE DEVIL.

651
00:51:11.486 --> 00:51:12.987
SOONER WE TALK
ABOUT THIS THING,


652
00:51:13.488 --> 00:51:16.491
THE SOONER WE GET
IT STRAIGHTENED OUT.


653
00:51:16.491 --> 00:51:18.993
I GUESS I
DON'T HAVE MUCH CHOICE, DO I?


654
00:51:23.998 --> 00:51:24.999
PHYLLIS.

655
00:51:39.514 --> 00:51:41.015
UM...

656
00:51:41.015 --> 00:51:43.517
ABOUT, UM,
UH, UH, UH...


657
00:51:43.518 --> 00:51:45.019
THE OTHER NIGHT...

658
00:51:48.022 --> 00:51:49.523
I NEED YOU.

659
00:51:51.025 --> 00:51:53.027
CHRIS...

660
00:51:53.027 --> 00:51:54.528
BABY, SOMETHING IS
HAPPENING TO ME,


661
00:51:54.529 --> 00:51:56.531
AND I DON'T KNOW
WHAT IT IS.


662
00:51:58.032 --> 00:52:01.035
I'VE NEVER FELT
THIS LOST BEFORE IN MY LIFE, BABY.


663
00:52:01.035 --> 00:52:03.537
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT'S HAPPENING.


664
00:52:03.538 --> 00:52:06.040
I KNOW I--I--I DID
SOMETHING FOUL TO YOU.


665
00:52:06.040 --> 00:52:08.042
I--I SAID SOME
FOUL THINGS.


666
00:52:08.042 --> 00:52:10.044
UH, I'M SORRY, BABY.

667
00:52:11.546 --> 00:52:12.547
AH...

668
00:52:17.051 --> 00:52:19.553
I WANT YOU TO COME
BACK TO ME, CHRIS.


669
00:52:22.056 --> 00:52:24.558
IT'S HARD, IKE.

670
00:52:24.559 --> 00:52:27.562
I'M JUST AS CONFUSED
AS YOU ARE.


671
00:52:27.562 --> 00:52:29.063
NOW, YOUR HEAD IS
IN A BAD PLACE


672
00:52:29.063 --> 00:52:31.065
FOR WHATEVER REASON.

673
00:52:32.567 --> 00:52:35.069
YOU BEAT ME UP,

674
00:52:35.069 --> 00:52:37.571
AND YET YOU SAY
YOU DON'T REMEMBER.


675
00:52:38.072 --> 00:52:39.573
I DON'T REMEMBER. CHRIS--

676
00:52:39.574 --> 00:52:41.075
THAT'S NOT THE POINT.

677
00:52:41.075 --> 00:52:44.078
NOW, HOW CAN I
BE SURE IT WON'T HAPPEN AGAIN?


678
00:52:46.581 --> 00:52:49.584
I DO LOVE YOU, IKE,

679
00:52:49.584 --> 00:52:51.586
AND I WANT TO
SEE YOU GET THIS THING CLEARED UP,


680
00:52:51.586 --> 00:52:53.087
BUT, IKE...

681
00:52:53.588 --> 00:52:55.089
OH, GOD.

682
00:52:56.090 --> 00:52:58.092
I'M SORRY, BABY.

683
00:52:58.092 --> 00:53:00.094
NO, NO, I'M SORRY.

684
00:53:02.096 --> 00:53:03.597
GOOD
-BYE, IKE.

685
00:53:07.101 --> 00:53:09.603
I'LL GIVE YOU A
CALL, AND, UM...

GOOD EVENING, CHILDREN.

697
00:53:46.674 --> 00:53:48.142
GOOD EVENING, REVEREND.

698
00:53:48.142 --> 00:53:51.145
HA HA. AND IT IS
A GOOD EVENING


699
00:53:51.145 --> 00:53:54.148
WITH ALL YOU GOOD
BROTHERS AND SISTERS HERE TONIGHT.


700
00:53:54.148 --> 00:53:55.649
AND WE GONNA TRY

701
00:53:55.650 --> 00:53:59.236
AND MAKE IT A
LITTLE BIT BETTER, ALL RIGHT?


702
00:53:59.236 --> 00:54:00.153
YEAH!

703
00:54:00.154 --> 00:54:01.155
AMEN, NOW.

704
00:54:01.155 --> 00:54:02.156
AMEN!

705
00:54:02.156 --> 00:54:05.159
FAITH IS THE EVIDENCE
OF THINGS HOPED FOR.


706
00:54:05.159 --> 00:54:06.160
OH, YEAH.

707
00:54:06.160 --> 00:54:09.663
FAITH IS THE EVIDENCE
OF THINGS UNSEEN.


708
00:54:10.164 --> 00:54:11.665
HA.

709
00:54:11.666 --> 00:54:13.167
YOU A BIG BOY NOW.
YOU CAN TAKE IT.


710
00:54:13.167 --> 00:54:15.669
YOU THINK I'M GONNA
TAKE IT, HUH?


711
00:54:15.670 --> 00:54:17.755
I'M GONNA TAKE YOU TO
THE KILLING FLOOR, HUH?


712
00:54:17.755 --> 00:54:20.674
AND I'M GONNA CUT YOU
EVERY KIND OF WAY.


713
00:54:20.841 --> 00:54:22.676
I'M GONNA CUT YOU
ALL KIND OF WAY.


714
00:54:22.677 --> 00:54:25.680
YOU KNOW, IT'S OVER.
YOUR LIFE IS OVER!


715
00:54:26.180 --> 00:54:27.681
GODDAMN...

716
00:54:28.182 --> 00:54:29.183
YOU!

717
00:54:30.184 --> 00:54:32.686
YOU THINK THAT--
GET OFF ME!


718
00:54:35.690 --> 00:54:38.192
OH, SHIT!

719
00:54:38.693 --> 00:54:40.194
I BELIEVE...

720
00:54:40.194 --> 00:54:44.198
I BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE WORKED
OUR WAY TO THIS POINT.


721
00:54:44.198 --> 00:54:47.701
I BELIEVE THE SOURCE
WE CALL OURSELVES...


722
00:54:47.702 --> 00:54:48.703
HA HA HA.

723
00:54:48.703 --> 00:54:50.705
AND THE SPIRIT
DID THAT PART,


724
00:54:50.705 --> 00:54:52.206
THE SPIRIT
DID THAT PART.


725
00:54:52.206 --> 00:54:55.709
I SAID THE SPIRIT
DID THAT PART!


726
00:54:56.210 --> 00:54:57.711
OH YEAH!

727
00:55:19.316 --> 00:55:22.235
I SAID THE SPIRIT
DID THAT PART!


728
00:55:27.241 --> 00:55:30.744
AND WE DID THAT ALL WITH
THE HELP OF THE SPIRIT.


729
00:55:30.745 --> 00:55:32.747
THE HOLY SPIRIT
DID US, HUH?


730
00:55:32.747 --> 00:55:34.749
THE HOLY SPIRIT. HA.

731
00:55:34.749 --> 00:55:36.751
YOU KNOW WHAT THE
HOLY SPIRIT IS, NOW?


732
00:55:37.251 --> 00:55:39.753
THE SPIRIT HELPED US

733
00:55:39.754 --> 00:55:41.789
TO MOVE ON UP

734
00:55:41.789 --> 00:55:43.257
A LITTLE HIGHER!

735
00:55:45.092 --> 00:55:47.260
MOVE ON UP A
LITTLE HIGHER!


736
00:55:47.261 --> 00:55:48.762
HA HA HA.

737
00:55:48.763 --> 00:55:51.265
I BELIEVE THAT THE
HOLY SPIRIT AND FAITH


738
00:55:51.766 --> 00:55:53.217
ARE THE HELPMATES

739
00:55:53.217 --> 00:55:55.769
THAT HELP US
TO SPAR, HUH?


740
00:55:55.770 --> 00:55:58.305
AGAINST THE EVIL,
WICKED LIFE!


741
00:55:58.305 --> 00:56:00.273
AND WITH THEIR HELP,

742
00:56:00.274 --> 00:56:02.276
WE WILL WIN!

743
00:56:02.276 --> 00:56:03.777
WE WILL WIN!

744
00:56:03.778 --> 00:56:06.280
LET THE CHURCH SAY ,
"WE WILL WIN!"


745
00:56:06.280 --> 00:56:08.282
WE WILL WIN!

746
00:56:09.283 --> 00:56:10.784
WE WILL WIN!

747
00:56:17.363 --> 00:56:19.365
WHY DON'T YOU GIVE
ME A LIFT HOME?


748
00:56:19.865 --> 00:56:21.366
YOU MEAN TO YOUR
FATHER'S PLACE?


749
00:56:21.367 --> 00:56:23.369
NO. I'VE GOT
MY OWN PLACE.


750
00:56:23.369 --> 00:56:24.870
I'M A BIG GIRL.

751
00:56:25.871 --> 00:56:26.955
SURE.

752
00:56:32.378 --> 00:56:34.880
GOOD EVENING. I'M
GLAD YOU COULD COME.


753
00:56:36.882 --> 00:56:39.885
PAPA, IKE'S GIVING ME A RIDE HOME.

754
00:56:44.890 --> 00:56:45.891
GOOD NIGHT.

755
00:57:26.882 --> 00:57:29.434
I DON'T LIKE HIM.
I DON'T WANT HIM AROUND.


756
00:57:29.435 --> 00:57:32.438
YOU SHOULDN'T
HAVE LET ROBERTA GO OFF WITH HIM.


757
00:57:32.438 --> 00:57:34.440
I LIKE HIM.
HE'S ALL RIGHT.


758
00:57:35.441 --> 00:57:37.943
WE'RE ALL GOD'S
CHILDREN, THEOTIS.


759
00:57:37.943 --> 00:57:38.944
"ALL GOD'S CHILDREN."

760
00:57:38.944 --> 00:57:40.445
SHIT, HE'S A ROWDY
STREET NIGGER,


761
00:57:40.446 --> 00:57:42.448
AND HE'S GONNA
CAUSE TROUBLE.


762
00:57:42.448 --> 00:57:44.950
ALWAYS HANGING AROUND
WITH HIS FUNNY EYES.


763
00:57:44.950 --> 00:57:47.452
HE'S ON SOMETHING,
AND HE IS TROUBLE.


764
00:57:49.455 --> 00:57:51.457
I'LL TEND TO
SPIRITUAL MATTERS,


765
00:57:51.457 --> 00:57:52.958
AND YOU RUN THE
ORGANIZATION, OK?


766
00:57:52.958 --> 00:57:54.492
YOU DO WHAT
YOU DO BEST,


767
00:57:54.493 --> 00:57:55.961
AND I'LL USE
MY OWN JUDGMENT


768
00:57:55.961 --> 00:57:57.462
IN THESE MATTERS.

769
00:57:57.463 --> 00:57:59.465
"SPIRITUAL MATTERS,"
MY BEHIND.


770
00:57:59.465 --> 00:58:02.468
YOU'RE STARTING TO
BELIEVE YOUR OWN JIVE SERMONS, BROTHER.


771
00:58:02.468 --> 00:58:03.969
YOU'RE PIMPING
GOD'S CONSCIOUSNESS


772
00:58:03.969 --> 00:58:06.471
LIKE SOME KIND
OF FAT WHORE.


773
00:58:06.472 --> 00:58:08.474
YOU'RE JUST SELLIN'
CHEAP FEEL-GOOD THRILLS


774
00:58:08.474 --> 00:58:09.975
TO A BUNCH OF SUCKERS
WHO ARE LOOKIN'


775
00:58:10.476 --> 00:58:13.979
FOR THE SECOND
COMING OF JESUS, OR SOME SUCH SHIT.


776
00:58:13.979 --> 00:58:16.264
JUST KEEP IN MIND
WHAT YOU REALLY DO, ELIJA,


777
00:58:16.265 --> 00:58:18.517
AND I'LL KEEP THE
SHOW RUNNING...


778
00:58:18.517 --> 00:58:19.985
SMOOTHLY.

779
00:58:20.986 --> 00:58:22.570
I FEEL NO
DANGER, THEOTIS.


780
00:58:22.571 --> 00:58:25.490
WELL, I SURE AS HELL DO,
AND I'M GONNA MAKE SURE


781
00:58:25.491 --> 00:58:28.994
THAT SOMEBODY KEEPS
A BEADY EYE ON HIS ASS.


782
00:58:29.995 --> 00:58:31.997
THERE IS NO
DANGER, THEOTIS.


783
00:58:36.001 --> 00:58:37.502
I KNOW THESE THINGS.

784
00:58:44.009 --> 00:58:45.510
WHAT ABOUT YOUR MAMA?

785
00:58:46.512 --> 00:58:47.513
I NEVER KNEW MY MOTHER.

786
00:58:47.513 --> 00:58:49.464
SHE DIED WHEN
I WAS A BABY.


787
00:58:51.016 --> 00:58:54.019
I LIVED WITH AN AUNT
TILL I WAS ABOUT 15.


788
00:58:54.019 --> 00:58:57.022
THEN I WENT TO

819
01:03:18.784 --> 01:03:19.785

824
01:04:44.288 --> 01:04:47.791
WHAT IN THE WORLD

825
01:04:47.791 --> 01:04:50.293
WHAT'S THE
MATTER, BABY?


826
01:04:50.294 --> 01:04:53.297
DON'T YOU LIKE YOUR

827
01:04:53.297 --> 01:04:55.799
OH, GOD. NOW, I

828
01:04:55.799 --> 01:04:57.300

01:04:57.301 --> 01:04:59.303

831
01:05:00.804 --> 01:05:01.805
I THOUGHT YOU

832
01:05:02.306 --> 01:05:03.807
IT WAS OVER. YOU
SAID IT WAS OVER!


833
01:05:03.807 --> 01:05:05.308
I HATE BITCHES
LIKE YOU,


834
01:05:05.309 --> 01:05:07.311
THINK YOU BETTER
THAN SOMEBODY ELSE.


835
01:05:07.811 --> 01:05:09.312
YOU JUST TRYIN' TO
GET IN BETWEEN ME


836
01:05:09.313 --> 01:05:10.314
AND WHAT I GOT TO DO.

837
01:05:10.314 --> 01:05:12.816
NOW, I DON'T WANT
THAT NIGGER FOLLOWING ME AROUND.


838
01:05:12.816 --> 01:05:15.318
YOU CALL HIM OFF,
THE MOTHERFUCKER.


839
01:05:22.826 --> 01:05:25.328
WHAT'S THE
MATTER, BABY?


840
01:05:27.331 --> 01:05:28.832
SCARED OF YOUR DADDY?

841
01:05:43.347 --> 01:05:45.349
I'M GOING TO TEACH
YOU ONCE AND FOR ALL


842
01:05:45.349 --> 01:05:46.850
TO FUCK WITH J.D. WALKER.

843
01:05:55.859 --> 01:05:57.360
NO! GOD!

844
01:06:18.882 --> 01:06:21.885

853
01:07:24.281 --> 01:07:27.951
OPEN THIS GODDAMN
DOOR! I'LL KILL YOUR ASS, BITCH!


854
01:07:30.954 --> 01:07:32.455
OH, GOD.

855
01:07:32.456 --> 01:07:33.457
MY GOD.

856
01:07:34.958 --> 01:07:36.960

OH, IKE. OH, GOD.

859
01:07:48.972 --> 01:07:50.473
IT'S ALL RIGHT.

860
01:07:51.975 --> 01:07:53.977
I DON'T NEED YOUR
ASS, YOU KNOW.


861
01:07:55.979 --> 01:07:57.480
OH, GOD.

862
01:08:34.518 --> 01:08:38.522
MAN, I AIN'T
SEEN A GETUP LIKE THAT IN 25 YEARS.


863
01:08:38.522 --> 01:08:41.024
AH, HA HA
HA. YEAH.


864
01:08:41.024 --> 01:08:43.526
YEAH, SHARP AS A TACK
AND READY TO STICK.


865
01:08:44.528 --> 01:08:46.530
DON'T YOU HAVE A TABLE?

866
01:08:46.530 --> 01:08:47.531
NOT RIGHT
NOW, SUGAR.


867
01:08:47.831 --> 01:08:49.032
I'M GONNA
LOOK AROUND.


868
01:08:49.032 --> 01:08:51.534
ALL RIGHT,
HAVE A GOOD TIME. HAVE A GOOD TIME.


869
01:09:37.581 --> 01:09:38.582
NOW...

870
01:09:40.083 --> 01:09:43.586
AIN'T YOU A
FINE YOUNG THING.


871
01:09:45.589 --> 01:09:47.591
WHAT'S YOUR NAME?

872
01:09:47.591 --> 01:09:50.093
SHERYL.
WHAT'S YOURS?


873
01:09:51.094 --> 01:09:52.562
J.D. WALKER.

874
01:09:54.097 --> 01:09:56.099
THE BOSS TALKER.

875
01:09:57.100 --> 01:09:59.102
THE WATER WALKER!

876
01:10:01.605 --> 01:10:05.108
YEAH. YOU'RE REALLY
SOMETHING ELSE.


877
01:10:05.108 --> 01:10:07.110
THAT'S RIGHT.

878
01:10:07.611 --> 01:10:09.112
ME AND JESUS.

879
01:10:18.622 --> 01:10:20.123
HE WASN'T HIMSELF.

880
01:10:21.625 --> 01:10:23.627
HE TURNED INTO THIS--
INTO THIS MONSTER,


881
01:10:24.127 --> 01:10:25.128
A WHOLE OTHER PERSON.

882
01:10:25.128 --> 01:10:27.130
I DON'T GIVE A
DAMN WHO HE WAS.


883
01:10:27.130 --> 01:10:29.632
LOOK AT YOU.
HE'S A MANIAC.


884
01:10:30.634 --> 01:10:31.635
I'M GONNA TEACH
HIM A LESSON.


885
01:10:32.052 --> 01:10:33.636
GODDAMN IT, CARL,
I KEEP TELLING YOU,


886
01:10:33.637 --> 01:10:35.639
THERE IS SOMETHING
WRONG WITH IKE.


887
01:10:35.639 --> 01:10:37.557
HE WAS TRYING TO
TELL ME, AND I WOULDN'T LISTEN.


888
01:10:37.557 --> 01:10:39.141
HE WAS CALLING
OUT FOR HELP.


889
01:10:39.142 --> 01:10:41.144
CHRIS, WHY DO YOU
KEEP DEFENDING HIM?


890
01:10:42.646 --> 01:10:44.147
HE ALMOST KILLED YOU.

891
01:10:44.314 --> 01:10:45.648
NO, LISTEN, MAN, SHE'S RIGHT.

892
01:10:45.816 --> 01:10:48.151
WE ALL SHOULD
HAVE KNOWN. WELL, I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN--


893
01:10:48.151 --> 01:10:50.069
THE HEADACHES,
THE DOCTOR THING.


894
01:10:50.070 --> 01:10:52.655
THE GUY WAS
GOING THROUGH SOME HEAVY CHANGES


895
01:10:52.656 --> 01:10:54.791
AND WOULDN'T
NOBODY LISTEN.


896
01:10:55.158 --> 01:10:57.493
TONIGHT, HE KEPT SAYING
HE WAS THIS "J.D. WALKER."

897
01:10:57.494 --> 01:10:59.662
J.D. WALKER.
IT WASN'T IKE. I KNOW THAT.


898
01:11:00.664 --> 01:11:02.082
I'M GOING AFTER HIM.

899
01:11:02.082 --> 01:11:03.666
AND I WANT TO GET
MY HANDS ON HIM


900
01:11:04.167 --> 01:11:05.668
BEFORE ANYBODY ELSE DOES.

901
01:11:05.752 --> 01:11:07.670
AW, MAN, WHY DON'T YOU LISTEN?

902
01:11:16.730 --> 01:11:19.182
I WARNED HER ABOUT
THAT GUY THE FIRST TIME HE BEAT HER UP.


903
01:11:19.683 --> 01:11:21.184
I TOLD HER HENDRICKS
WOULD BE DANGEROUS,


904
01:11:21.184 --> 01:11:22.185
BUT SHE WOULDN'T LISTEN.

905
01:11:22.185 --> 01:11:23.686
SHE WENT BACK
TO HIM ANYWAY.


906
01:11:23.687 --> 01:11:26.189
NOW SHE ENDS UP
HALF DEAD AND RAPED.


907
01:11:26.189 --> 01:11:28.191
CARL, I'M
WARNING YOU. NOW, SIMMER DOWN.


908
01:11:28.191 --> 01:11:29.692
YOU CAN'T AFFORD TO
GO LOSING YOUR HEAD


909
01:11:29.693 --> 01:11:31.194
OVER THIS THING.

910
01:11:31.194 --> 01:11:33.696
THERE'S AN APB
OUT ON HIM. WE'LL GET HIM.


911
01:11:33.697 --> 01:11:35.699
I WISH I COULD
GET MY HANDS ON HIM FIRST.


912
01:11:35.699 --> 01:11:38.118
I'D BLOW HIS
GODDAMN BRAINS AWAY.


913
01:11:38.118 --> 01:11:39.702
HE'S A MANIAC, GEORGE,

914
01:11:39.703 --> 01:11:41.705
A FUCKIN' SCHIZO KILLER.

915
01:11:41.705 --> 01:11:43.707
"J.D. WALKER," MY ASS.

916
01:11:44.207 --> 01:11:45.708
WHAT?

917
01:11:45.709 --> 01:11:49.179
AH, THE BASTARD
TOLD CHRIS HIS NAME WAS J.D. WALKER.


918
01:11:50.714 --> 01:11:52.716
J.D. WALKER'S
BEEN DEAD...


919
01:11:52.716 --> 01:11:54.217
FOR OVER 30 YEARS.

920
01:12:02.726 --> 01:12:06.279
THAT WAS THE BEST
FUCKING I EVER HAD.


921
01:12:06.730 --> 01:12:10.734
THAT'S 'CAUSE
YOU'VE BEEN DEALIN' WITH THE ACE.


922
01:12:10.734 --> 01:12:13.236
YOU GOT TO LEAVE?
WHERE YOU GOIN', SUGAR?


923
01:12:13.236 --> 01:12:15.238
I GOT BUSINESS
TO TAKE CARE OF.


924
01:12:21.463 --> 01:12:23.965
OH, SHIT,
THAT'S MY OLD MAN!


925
01:12:23.965 --> 01:12:24.966
SHIT!

926
01:12:25.967 --> 01:12:27.468
BETTER GO TALK TO HIM.

927
01:12:28.970 --> 01:12:30.471
SHERYL?

928
01:12:32.474 --> 01:12:36.978
HEY. WHAT YOU DOING
BACK SO SOON, BABY?


929
01:12:36.978 --> 01:12:38.980
YOU GOT SOMEBODY WITH
YOU, DON'T YOU, BITCH?


930
01:12:39.481 --> 01:12:40.982
NO. NO. I--
YEAH, YOU GOT SOMEBODY WITH YOU.


931
01:12:40.982 --> 01:12:42.483
AND I'M GONNA

932
01:12:42.484 --> 01:12:43.985

933
01:12:45.487 --> 01:12:47.121
YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT.

934
01:12:48.490 --> 01:12:49.991
I FUCKED YOUR WOMAN.

935
01:12:50.992 --> 01:12:52.994
SUCKER.

936
01:12:52.994 --> 01:12:54.996
MOTHERFUCKER,

01:12:54.996 --> 01:12:57.498
I'M GONNA RIP

940
01:13:07.726 --> 01:13:10.512
I'M THE CRAZIEST NIGGER

941
01:13:19.521 --> 01:13:21.022
YEAH.

942
01:13:22.023 --> 01:13:24.525
I'M GONNA CUT YOU EVERY

01:14:09.070 --> 01:14:10.571
YOU GET UP,

948
01:14:10.572 --> 01:14:12.574
I'LL SEND YOU TO
MEET YOUR MAKER.


949
01:14:19.080 --> 01:14:21.082
NOW, WHAT YOU KNOW?

950
01:14:22.584 --> 01:14:24.586
BIG NIGGER
GOT SOME SENSE.


951
01:14:25.587 --> 01:14:27.088
HEH HEH HEH.

952
01:14:34.095 --> 01:14:35.596
I'M TAKING YOUR CAR.

953
01:14:38.600 --> 01:14:40.101
GOOD NIGHT, SUGAR.

954
01:15:39.744 --> 01:15:40.661
PLEASE!

955
01:15:42.664 --> 01:15:44.165
LET ME GO!

956
01:16:10.191 --> 01:16:12.076
I'LL HAVE MY REVENGE!

957
01:16:44.726 --> 01:16:46.728
GONNA GIVE YOU A BREAK, MAN. I'
M GONNA MASH YOUR FACE.

958
01:16:55.737 --> 01:16:57.155
YOU A BIG BOY, YOU TAKE IT.

959
01:16:57.155 --> 01:16:59.740
I'M GONNA TAKE IT, HUH?
THINK I'M GONNA TAKE IT?


960
01:16:59.741 --> 01:17:01.626
I'M GONNA TAKE YOU
TO THE KILLING FLOOR,


961
01:17:01.626 --> 01:17:04.712
AND I'LL CUT
YOU EVERY TIME!


962
01:17:04.712 --> 01:17:06.747
I'M GONNA CUT YOU
ALL KINDS OF WAYS!


963
01:17:06.748 --> 01:17:09.250
IT'S OVER!
YOUR LIFE IS OVER!


964
01:17:09.751 --> 01:17:10.752
AMEN!

965
01:17:10.752 --> 01:17:12.253
THE CHURCH SAYS, "AMEN!"

966
01:17:12.754 --> 01:17:13.755
AMEN!

967
01:17:13.755 --> 01:17:15.757
ANYTHING THAT YOU
CAN CONCEIVE


968
01:17:15.757 --> 01:17:18.760
AND BELIEVE IN
CAN BECOME TRUE!


969
01:17:18.760 --> 01:17:22.263
AS LONG AS IT BECOMES
A THOUGHT IN YOUR MIND,


970
01:17:22.263 --> 01:17:23.764
THEN IT BECOMES
A REALITY!


971
01:17:23.765 --> 01:17:26.267
NOW, IF I HAD NOT
THOUGHT THAT IT WAS POSSIBLE


972
01:17:26.267 --> 01:17:29.770
FOR ME TO CHANGE
MY LIFE, I'D BE IN THE GUTTER TODAY!


973
01:17:29.771 --> 01:17:31.272
AMEN!

974
01:17:31.272 --> 01:17:32.773
WE ARE ALL--

975
01:17:43.785 --> 01:17:46.788
SO YOU'RE A JACKLEG
PREACHER NOW, HUH, ELIJA?


976
01:17:59.300 --> 01:18:01.302
YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT.

977
01:18:01.302 --> 01:18:02.803
IT'S J.D. WALKER.

978
01:18:05.223 --> 01:18:07.692
WHERE'S THAT GOOD-FOR-NOTHING
BROTHER OF YOURS?


979
01:18:08.810 --> 01:18:10.311
I GOT A SCORE TO SETTLE WITH HIM.

980
01:18:15.817 --> 01:18:17.819
WHY DID YOU COME BACK, J.D.?

981
01:18:18.820 --> 01:18:21.322
MY BUSINESS IS WITH THEOTIS.

982
01:18:22.323 --> 01:18:24.325
YOU NEVER WAS IN THIS.

983
01:18:26.327 --> 01:18:29.830
YOU TELL THEOTIS TO MEET
ME ON THE KILLING FLOOR.


984
01:18:31.332 --> 01:18:33.334
HE KNOW WHERE IT IS.

985
01:18:40.842 --> 01:18:42.343
WHOO!
HA HA HA!


986
01:18:43.344 --> 01:18:45.346
WHOO!
HA HA HA!


987
01:18:54.355 --> 01:18:56.357
WALKER TURNED UP
DEAD ONE NIGHT.


988
01:18:56.357 --> 01:18:58.359
THEY NEVER FOUND
OUT WHO KILLED HIM.


989
01:18:58.359 --> 01:19:00.361
HE WAS A HUSTLER.

990
01:19:00.361 --> 01:19:01.362
RAN A NUMBERS GAME

991
01:19:01.362 --> 01:19:04.365
AND A BLACK-MARKET MEAT
RACKET DURING THE WAR.


992
01:19:04.365 --> 01:19:07.868
HE HAD A LOT OF ENEMIES
AND A LOT OF WOMEN.


993
01:19:07.869 --> 01:19:08.836
HMM.

994
01:19:10.371 --> 01:19:13.874
BLISS WAS INVOLVED
IN THE UNDERWORLD IN THE '40s,


995
01:19:13.875 --> 01:19:16.377
AND HENDRICKS
IS TIED TO HIM.


996
01:19:16.377 --> 01:19:18.879
BUT WHY? WHY WOULD
A KID LIKE HENDRICKS


997
01:19:18.880 --> 01:19:20.882
EVEN KNOW ABOUT J.D. WALKER?

998
01:19:22.884 --> 01:19:24.385
CARL.

999
01:19:24.385 --> 01:19:26.804
JUST GOT A REPORT
OF A GUY FITTING HENDRICKS' DESCRIPTION


1000
01:19:26.804 --> 01:19:29.389
TRIED TO KILL
A MAN AND HIS WIFE WITH A RAZOR.


1001
01:19:29.390 --> 01:19:32.893
HE TOOK THEIR
CONTINENTAL. WE GOT THE LICENSE NUMBER.


1002
01:19:35.813 --> 01:19:37.268
WHAT THE HELL
DO YOU MEAN


1003
01:19:37.269 --> 01:19:39.271
J.D. WALKER IS BACK?

1004
01:19:39.271 --> 01:19:41.273
HE'S BACK. I SAW HIM.

1005
01:19:41.273 --> 01:19:43.275
HE SAID HE
HAS A SCORE TO SETTLE WITH YOU.


1006
01:19:43.275 --> 01:19:45.277
IT'S SOME HUSTLER
RUNNING A GAME.


1007
01:19:45.277 --> 01:19:49.564
THIS IS WHAT COMES
OF BEING SO OPEN ABOUT THE PAST.


1008
01:19:49.565 --> 01:19:53.785
IT'S NOT A GAME.
J.D. WALKER IS BACK.


1009
01:19:56.789 --> 01:19:59.291
DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND?
THIS IS A TEST.


1010
01:19:59.291 --> 01:20:00.792
GOD IS TESTING ME.

1011
01:20:00.793 --> 01:20:05.414
THIS BOY IS POSSESSED BY
THE SPIRIT OF J.D. WALKER.


1012
01:20:05.798 --> 01:20:09.802
THEOTIS, HIS SOUL
MUST BE PURGED OF THIS EVIL SPIRIT.


1013
01:20:09.802 --> 01:20:13.305
I MUST MAKE J.D.
UNDERSTAND THAT HIS SOUL WON'T REST


1014
01:20:13.305 --> 01:20:14.806
UNTIL HE COMES TO GRIPS

1015
01:20:14.807 --> 01:20:16.892
WITH THIS HEINOUS
CRIME HE COMMITTED.


1016
01:20:16.892 --> 01:20:21.229
THEOTIS, IT IS
REALLY MY FIGHT.


1017
01:20:21.230 --> 01:20:24.316
IT WAS I WHO
LOVED BETTY JO.


1018
01:20:24.316 --> 01:20:26.818
IT WAS BECAUSE OF
ME THAT HE KILLED HIS ONLY SISTER.


1019
01:20:27.820 --> 01:20:29.321
WELL...

1020
01:20:29.822 --> 01:20:30.823
I'LL GET RID OF THE FOOL.

1021
01:20:32.324 --> 01:20:34.826
NO. I WILL GO
AND TALK TO HIM.


1022
01:20:36.328 --> 01:20:38.697
THAT ALMOST GOT YOU
KILLED ONCE BEFORE.


1023
01:20:38.697 --> 01:20:40.832
THEOTIS, I'VE ALWAYS
BEEN INDEBTED TO YOU


1024
01:20:40.833 --> 01:20:42.835
FOR SAVING MY LIFE.

1025
01:20:42.835 --> 01:20:46.288
NOW, ME AND ROBERTA
SUFFERED A TERRIBLE LOSS


1026
01:20:46.839 --> 01:20:48.340
WHEN BETTY JO WAS KILLED.

1027
01:20:48.340 --> 01:20:51.843
NOW, THIS THING,
I MUST BRING THIS THING TO AN END.


1028
01:20:52.344 --> 01:20:55.347
I WILL WALK INTO
THE VALLEY OF THE SHADOW OF DEATH


1029
01:20:55.347 --> 01:20:57.849
AND TALK THIS
EVIL SPIRIT DOWN.


1030
01:20:58.050 --> 01:20:59.851
ELIJA, DEAL WITH
THE REAL WORLD.


1031
01:20:59.852 --> 01:21:02.855
WE DON'T KNOW WHAT
THIS MANIAC WILL DO.


1032
01:21:02.855 --> 01:21:05.858
NO, THEOTIS, JUST ONCE...

1033
01:21:06.358 --> 01:21:08.360
LET'S DO IT MY WAY.

1034
01:21:15.367 --> 01:21:16.368
OK.

1035
01:21:17.870 --> 01:21:19.371
WE'LL BOTH GO.

1036
01:21:58.911 --> 01:22:01.413
YOU'RE CRAZY. YOU'
RE SUCH AN IDIOT.

1037
01:22:02.915 --> 01:22:05.417
YOU SAID YOU WERE GONNA LEAVE ELIJA!

1038
01:22:06.919 --> 01:22:08.921
YOU SAID YOU WAS
COMING WITH ME!


1039
01:22:08.921 --> 01:22:12.424
YOU'RE SUCH AN IDIOT.
YOU'RE SUCH A FOOL.


1040
01:22:12.424 --> 01:22:13.925
I GAVE YOU MONEY!

1041
01:22:13.926 --> 01:22:15.928
YOU COULD NEVER
GIVE ME ENOUGH MONEY.


1042
01:22:15.928 --> 01:22:18.297
I GIVE YOU MORE
THAN ELIJA GIVES YOU!


1043
01:22:18.297 --> 01:22:20.215
IF YOU DON'T STOP,

1044
01:22:20.215 --> 01:22:23.434
I'M GONNA TELL ELIJA
THAT BABY ISN'T HIS,


1045
01:22:23.435 --> 01:22:25.937
AND HE'LL KICK YOU
OUT IN THE STREET.


1046
01:22:25.938 --> 01:22:27.940
IF YOU DO,
I'LL KILL YOU!


1047
01:22:27.940 --> 01:22:29.441
YOU WOULDN'T
DO ANYTHING.


1048
01:22:29.441 --> 01:22:31.359
YOU AIN'T GONNA
TELL NOTHIN'!


1049
01:22:31.360 --> 01:22:32.444
HA HA HA!

1050
01:22:33.729 --> 01:22:35.447
YOU AIN'T GONNA
TELL NOTHIN'!


1051
01:22:50.963 --> 01:22:51.964
BETTY JO!

1052
01:22:52.914 --> 01:22:54.966
OH, GOD!

1053
01:23:06.979 --> 01:23:08.180
MURDERER.

1054
01:23:12.985 --> 01:23:14.987
MURDERER!

1055
01:23:19.491 --> 01:23:21.493
MURDERER!

1056
01:24:51.083 --> 01:24:52.584
J.D.!

1057
01:24:59.091 --> 01:25:00.592
J.D. WALKER!

1058
01:25:02.094 --> 01:25:03.595
WE'RE HERE!

1059
01:25:12.604 --> 01:25:15.106
I'VE COME TO SAVE
YOUR SOUL, J.D.


1060
01:25:24.116 --> 01:25:26.118
LET THIS
FEUD BE OVER.


1061
01:25:29.121 --> 01:25:31.123
LET YOUR SOUL REST.

1062
01:25:33.625 --> 01:25:36.127
LEAVE VENGEANCE
TO THE LORD.


1063
01:25:36.128 --> 01:25:37.629
SHUT UP, ELIJA!

1064
01:25:38.130 --> 01:25:40.382
FOOL!

1065
01:25:40.382 --> 01:25:43.134
YOU ALWAYS BEEN THE
BOOTLICKIN' LACKEY!


1066
01:25:43.418 --> 01:25:46.137
YOU STILL IS A
BUCK-DANCIN' NIGGER PUPPET!


1067
01:25:47.639 --> 01:25:49.641
YOU SHOULD'VE STAYED
IN YOUR CHURCH, ELIJA!


1068
01:25:51.143 --> 01:25:53.645
I TOLD YOU MY BUSINESS
WAS WITH THEOTIS.


1069
01:25:58.934 --> 01:26:01.152
GET OUT OF HERE!

1070
01:26:05.157 --> 01:26:07.409
THEOTIS KILLED
MY SISTER!


1071
01:26:10.162 --> 01:26:14.166
YOU TOOK DIVES WHENEVER
THAT NIGGER TOLD YOU TO.


1072
01:26:17.607 --> 01:26:20.109
YOU THE CHUMP,
ALL RIGHT, ELIJA!


1073
01:26:22.111 --> 01:26:24.613
THEOTIS KILLED BETTY JO

1074
01:26:24.614 --> 01:26:27.083
BECAUSE SHE WAS GONNA
TELL YOU SOMETHING!


1075
01:26:28.584 --> 01:26:31.253
THAT BABY SHE
HAD WASN'T YOURS!


1076
01:26:32.121 --> 01:26:33.455
BELONGED TO THEOTIS!

1077
01:26:40.129 --> 01:26:41.713
ROBERTA...

1078
01:26:44.133 --> 01:26:47.636
YOU LOOK JUST
LIKE YOUR MAMA.


1079
01:26:53.643 --> 01:26:55.645
I HAD TO DO IT.

1080
01:26:55.645 --> 01:26:59.148
YOUR MAMA AND J.D.
WERE NO DAMN GOOD.


1081
01:27:02.652 --> 01:27:03.653
THEOTIS...

1082
01:27:05.154 --> 01:27:08.157
IN THE NAME OF JESUS...

1083
01:27:10.159 --> 01:27:12.661
I MADE YOU.

1084
01:27:12.662 --> 01:27:15.665
YOU WERE NOTHING WITHOUT
ME. YOU WERE SHIT.


1085
01:27:17.166 --> 01:27:20.669
I MADE YOU, AND
SHE WAS WITH YOU.


1086
01:27:20.670 --> 01:27:23.556
SHE HAD MY CHILD,
BUT SHE WAS WITH YOU.


1087
01:27:25.675 --> 01:27:27.093
SHE LAUGHED AT ME,

1088
01:27:27.093 --> 01:27:29.678
MOCKED ME,
THREATENED TO TELL.


1089
01:27:29.679 --> 01:27:32.181
I HAD TO KILL THE BITCH.

1090
01:27:34.150 --> 01:27:35.184
NO!

1091
01:27:37.486 --> 01:27:39.187
PAPA!

1092
01:27:41.574 --> 01:27:43.692
GIVE ME THE GUN,
ELIJA! I'LL KILL YOU!


1093
01:27:46.162 --> 01:27:47.913
KILL YOU!

1094
01:27:47.914 --> 01:27:49.115
PAPA!

1095
01:27:51.584 --> 01:27:52.868
KILL HIM!

1096
01:28:07.183 --> 01:28:08.551
YOU'RE DEAD!

1097
01:28:32.742 --> 01:28:33.743
I-
-I KILLED HIM.

1098
01:28:37.747 --> 01:28:39.248
NO.

1099
01:28:43.753 --> 01:28:45.254
OH, GOD.

1100
01:28:46.756 --> 01:28:47.757
OH!

1101
01:28:53.813 --> 01:28:55.764
SWEET JESUS.

1102
01:29:12.915 --> 01:29:15.284
OH, SWEET JESUS.

1103
01:29:18.788 --> 01:29:20.289
HENDRICKS!

1104
01:29:21.791 --> 01:29:23.292
I'LL KILL YOU.

1105
01:29:24.293 --> 01:29:25.294
OUH!

1106
01:29:36.105 --> 01:29:37.306
CARL!

1107
01:29:38.224 --> 01:29:39.808
CARL!

1108
01:29:39.809 --> 01:29:42.311
WHAT THE HELL'S
THE MATTER WITH YOU?


1109
01:29:54.323 --> 01:29:55.824
NO!

1110
01:30:22.351 --> 01:30:23.352
HELP ME, GOD.

1111
01:30:25.855 --> 01:30:27.356
WHAT HAVE I DONE?

1112
01:30:30.359 --> 01:30:32.861
WHAT HAVE I DONE?

1113
01:30:40.669 --> 01:30:41.870
YOU LIVE IN NEW ORLEANS?

1114
01:30:41.871 --> 01:30:42.872
YES.

1115
01:30:42.872 --> 01:30:44.874
DRIVE A CAB?
RIGHT.


1116
01:30:44.874 --> 01:30:47.877
YOU SAID YOU GO
TO LAW SCHOOL. ARE YOU MARRIED?


1117
01:30:48.377 --> 01:30:49.378
NOT REALLY.

1118
01:30:49.378 --> 01:30:51.880
LIVING WITH SOMEONE.
WHAT'S HER NAME?


1119
01:30:51.881 --> 01:30:53.382
CHRISTELLA BORDEN.

1120
01:30:53.382 --> 01:30:55.884
YOU CAN REMEMBER
THAT, BUT NOT ANYTHING ELSE?


1121
01:30:55.885 --> 01:30:56.886
NOT MUCH.

1122
01:30:57.386 --> 01:30:58.387
LET'S KEEP ON TRYING.

1123
01:31:03.893 --> 01:31:05.394
THE GIRL SAYS SHE DID IT.

1124
01:31:05.895 --> 01:31:07.396
I DON'T BELIEVE
THAT FOR A MINUTE.


1125
01:31:07.396 --> 01:31:09.898
I WANT THAT
JOKER'S ASS UNDER THE JAIL.


1126
01:31:09.899 --> 01:31:12.401
HENDRICKS SAYS HE CAN'T
REMEMBER ANYTHING.


1127
01:31:12.401 --> 01:31:14.403
OF COURSE HE DOESN'T!
HE DOESN'T WANT TO BE


1128
01:31:14.403 --> 01:31:16.822
SLAPPED WITH A
MURDER 1, NOT TO MENTION FORCIBLE RAPE.


1129
01:31:16.822 --> 01:31:19.241
YOU'RE JUST PISSED
OFF BECAUSE THE GIRL WON'T PRESS CHARGES.


1130
01:31:19.241 --> 01:31:20.909
THE SON OF A
BITCH RAPED HER!


1131
01:31:20.910 --> 01:31:22.411
SHE WON'T
PRESS CHARGES!


1132
01:31:40.930 --> 01:31:42.932
YOU'RE TELLING ME
I DID ALL THOSE WEIRD THINGS


1133
01:31:42.932 --> 01:31:44.934
BECAUSE I WAS POSSESSED?

1134
01:31:44.934 --> 01:31:48.437
IT WAS J.D.'S VOICE AND HIS MANNER.

1135
01:31:48.437 --> 01:31:51.940
ISAAC HENDRICKS WAS A
VESSEL FOR GOD'S JUSTICE.


1136
01:31:53.442 --> 01:31:58.447
AND NOW HE'S FREE
TO LIVE HIS OWN LIFE.


1137
01:31:58.447 --> 01:32:02.451
J.D. WALKER CAN, UH...
REST IN ETERNAL PEACE.


1138
01:32:03.452 --> 01:32:04.953
YOU MEAN...

1139
01:32:06.455 --> 01:32:08.957
I CAN JUST BE WALKIN'
DOWN THE STREET


1140
01:32:09.959 --> 01:32:11.961
AND GET TAKEN
OVER BY SOME DEMON


1141
01:32:11.961 --> 01:32:14.964
OUT TO GET REVENGE
ON SOMEBODY?


1142
01:32:14.964 --> 01:32:17.967
IT CAN HAPPEN
ANYTIME, ANYWHERE.


1143
01:32:17.967 --> 01:32:20.970
YOU WERE POSSESSED.
THERE'S NO DOUBT ABOUT THAT.


1144
01:32:28.477 --> 01:32:29.978
BUT IS IT OVER?

1145
01:32:32.481 --> 01:32:34.983
HOW DO I KNOW IT
WON'T HAPPEN AGAIN?


1146
01:32:35.484 --> 01:32:37.486
THERE'S NO WAY
TO KNOW THAT.


1147
01:32:38.487 --> 01:32:40.622
AW, THAT'S CRAZY.

1148
01:32:40.623 --> 01:32:42.825
ALL RIGHT, LET'
S SET THE RECORD STRAIGHT.

1149
01:32:42.825 --> 01:32:44.993
IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING
THAT IN THE A--STRUGGLE,


1150
01:32:44.994 --> 01:32:46.495
THE GUN WENT OFF.

1151
01:32:46.495 --> 01:32:47.496
THEOTIS MIGHT HAVE EVEN

1152
01:32:47.496 --> 01:32:49.998
PULLED THE TRIGGER
HIMSELF, RIGHT?


1153
01:32:52.001 --> 01:32:53.502
YES.

1154
01:32:53.502 --> 01:32:56.004
ALL RIGHT. THAT
WRAPS IT UP FOR ME.


1155
01:33:03.512 --> 01:33:05.013
PAPA.

1156
01:33:10.519 --> 01:33:13.021
I RAISED YOU
AS MY DAUGHTER,


1157
01:33:13.022 --> 01:33:15.524
AND YOU'LL ALWAYS
BE THAT TO ME.


1158
01:33:18.527 --> 01:33:20.028
COME ON.
LET'S GO.


1159
01:33:22.531 --> 01:33:26.034
IKE, I DON'T WANT
TO HAVE TO SEE YOU IN HERE AGAIN.


1160
01:33:38.047 --> 01:33:41.050
I DON'T--I DON'T
WANT TO BE BACK HERE AGAIN.


1161
01:33:42.551 --> 01:33:44.553
UH--THANK YOU,
CAPTAIN.


1162
01:33:48.557 --> 01:33:50.225
BAD SUIT, BLOOD.

1163
01:33:55.268 --> 01:33:57.770
MAN, I'M SORRY,
BUT I HAD TO.


1164
01:34:00.273 --> 01:34:02.275
I COULD USE
SOMETHING TO EAT.


1165
01:34:02.275 --> 01:34:03.276
THAT'S
NOTHIN' NEW.


1166
01:34:03.777 --> 01:34:05.278
THAT'S HIS PROBLEM.
ALWAYS EATIN'.


1167
01:34:05.278 --> 01:34:07.280
HEY, MAN, DO

1168
01:34:07.280 --> 01:34:11.284
NOW, PEOPLE CALL
THIS A NATURAL ROCK FORMATION.


1169
01:34:11.284 --> 01:34:13.786
THERE'S YOUR NATURAL
ROCK FORMATION, MAN.


1170
01:34:15.789 --> 01:34:17.290
