00:25:37.687 --> 00:25:39.284
God damn it, Frank.

489
00:25:39.319 --> 00:25:44.357
You should have let
me go first. (crying)


490
00:25:45.992 --> 00:25:47.696
- Baby, what's going on?

491
00:25:47.731 --> 00:25:50.895
- I was gonna leave you, Frank.

492
00:25:50.931 --> 00:25:52.670
At the club, Frank.

493
00:25:52.705 --> 00:25:54.603
God, I've done it
hundreds of times.


494
00:25:54.638 --> 00:25:56.105
I run the credit card

495
00:25:56.141 --> 00:25:58.603
and then I'm gone before you
even get kicked out, but,


496
00:25:58.638 --> 00:26:03.211
I didn't know that he was
gonna yank me around and, and,


497
00:26:03.246 --> 00:26:06.044
God damn it, you weren't
supposed to burst in, Frank.


498
00:26:06.079 --> 00:26:07.012
Nobody ever fucking bursts in,

499
00:26:07.047 --> 00:26:10.187
nobody ever fucking bursts in!

500
00:26:10.222 --> 00:26:11.720
- But...

501
00:26:11.755 --> 00:26:13.721
- I coulda handled him, Frank.

502
00:26:13.756 --> 00:26:14.987
I coulda handled him.

503
00:26:15.022 --> 00:26:17.594
You didn't have to do that.

504
00:26:17.629 --> 00:26:18.993
It's fine, you can just, um,

505
00:26:19.029 --> 00:26:21.231
drop me off at a bus
stop or something.


506
00:26:21.266 --> 00:26:22.197
I can...

507
00:26:23.332 --> 00:26:27.202
- But you, you told me you
wanted to come with me.


508
00:26:28.167 --> 00:26:31.138
- Those are just words, Frank.

509
00:26:31.173 --> 00:26:34.880
Everybody says them
and nobody means them.


510
00:26:38.719 --> 00:26:42.217
Don't, please don't
look at me like that.

(knocking on window)

00:29:11.205 --> 00:29:12.037
- Ma'am.

538
00:29:12.902 --> 00:29:15.233
I, I know you scared.

539
00:29:15.268 --> 00:29:17.339
Hell, hell I would be, too.

540
00:29:17.374 --> 00:29:19.976
You know, but, but, but
ifin you popped the trunk,


541
00:29:20.011 --> 00:29:22.213
I, I could change
that tire and you,


542
00:29:22.248 --> 00:29:27.382
you could stay seated up in
there nice and, nice and safe.


543
00:29:28.218 --> 00:29:31.218
- I, I checked the trunk
and there's no spare.


544
00:29:31.253 --> 00:29:34.655
And I'm just really
scared of you.


545
00:29:34.691 --> 00:29:35.522
- Well uh,

546
00:29:37.430 --> 00:29:38.261
God bless.

547
00:29:46.735 --> 00:29:47.567
- Sorry.

548
00:29:55.108 --> 00:29:57.610
(tense music)

(ominous music)

550
00:30:32.112 --> 00:30:33.613
- Yeah, you right.

551
00:30:35.247 --> 00:30:36.783
There's no spare.

552
00:30:36.818 --> 00:30:41.786
I could uh, tow you
into Quicksilver,
about four miles up.


553
00:30:43.030 --> 00:30:44.090
We, we could probably
get you rolling again


554
00:30:44.125 --> 00:30:46.131
by tomorrow afternoon.

555
00:30:53.307 --> 00:30:53.899
- Yeah.

556
00:30:53.934 --> 00:30:54.733
- Okay.

557
00:30:56.674 --> 00:30:57.472
All right.

558
00:31:05.215 --> 00:31:08.751
You gotta get in
the driver's side.


559
00:31:08.786 --> 00:31:10.719
Well, slide on in.

560
00:31:10.755 --> 00:31:13.455
(tense music)

561
00:31:27.706 --> 00:31:30.505
(phone dialing)

562
00:31:32.643 --> 00:31:33.508
- Yeah.

563
00:31:34.682 --> 00:31:37.212
Yeah I got one coming in.

564
00:31:37.248 --> 00:31:39.550
- Um, do you think
maybe that I can use it?


565
00:31:39.585 --> 00:31:40.581
- Oh, sorry.

566
00:31:41.687 --> 00:31:43.386
Business use only.

567
00:31:51.056 --> 00:31:55.264
You know that, that rolled up
glass wouldn't protect you,


568
00:31:55.299 --> 00:31:58.698
if, if someone really
wanted some of you.


569
00:31:59.867 --> 00:32:04.338
And, and I, I can think of
plenty of romantic things that,


570
00:32:04.374 --> 00:32:07.240
that some fellows would
want to do to you.


571
00:32:07.275 --> 00:32:09.841
Hell, just over and over again.

572
00:32:12.118 --> 00:32:15.847
And you, and you all
the way out here, alone.


573
00:32:20.390 --> 00:32:24.825
But, but they sinners,
and I, I know that.


574
00:32:24.861 --> 00:32:26.031
You know?

575
00:32:26.066 --> 00:32:28.530
And, and, and, and
running away from sin


576
00:32:28.566 --> 00:32:33.370
is what keep me focused
solely on, on that flat tire.


577
00:32:34.936 --> 00:32:35.768
I mean,

578
00:32:38.338 --> 00:32:40.311
unless you wanted it.

579
00:32:43.409 --> 00:32:45.546
'Cause Chisos says that,

580
00:32:45.582 --> 00:32:49.584
that, that little want
makes all the difference.


581
00:32:51.517 --> 00:32:54.322
He says that that, that want,

582
00:32:54.357 --> 00:32:57.460
is what bring the
carn, the carnal,


583
00:32:59.233 --> 00:33:03.598
into the cathedral and the,
the hole into the holy.


584
00:33:04.572 --> 00:33:07.739

00:33:07.774 --> 00:33:10.803
(radio static buzzing)

586
00:33:23.255 --> 00:33:26.654
I, I was just, I was
just talking is all.


587
00:33:28.028 --> 00:33:30.790
I, I, I don't mean
nothing by it.


588
00:33:43.776 --> 00:33:44.775
(sirens blaring)

589
00:33:44.811 --> 00:33:46.006
- Baby, baby, baby.

590
00:33:46.041 --> 00:33:47.743
- Hm, what?

591
00:33:47.778 --> 00:33:48.580
- Fuck.

592
00:33:48.615 --> 00:33:49.676
Fuck, okay.

593
00:33:49.711 --> 00:33:52.411
Okay, put the money
away, put the money away.


594
00:33:52.447 --> 00:33:54.379
Where's the gun,
where's the gun?


595
00:33:54.415 --> 00:33:55.481
Hurry up.
- It's okay.


596
00:33:55.716 --> 00:33:58.950
- Hurry up, hurry up,
hurry up, hurry up.


597
00:34:00.586 --> 00:34:02.322
- [Penelope] It's gonna be okay.

598
00:34:02.357 --> 00:34:04.923
I, I'll just talk to him, baby.

599
00:34:07.294 --> 00:34:09.796
(tense music)

600
00:34:13.233 --> 00:34:14.438
- Beautiful.

601
00:34:22.948 --> 00:34:24.943
Say hello to sin for me.

602
00:34:27.184 --> 00:34:29.354
I love this time of the year.

603
00:34:29.389 --> 00:34:33.253
Classics all over the blacktop,
all going at the show.


604
00:34:33.289 --> 00:34:34.757
Y'all showing or selling?

605
00:34:34.792 --> 00:34:36.021
- Both.

606
00:34:36.056 --> 00:34:38.625
Who knows, you might even
pull us over on the way back,


607
00:34:38.660 --> 00:34:40.594
driving in something
even sweeter than this


608
00:34:40.630 --> 00:34:43.768
if I see something that
makes my thighs twitch.


609
00:34:43.803 --> 00:34:45.602
(Officer chuckles)

610
00:34:45.637 --> 00:34:50.402
- I don't know, sweetie, it's
hard to beat a 68 B, but uh,


611
00:34:50.437 --> 00:34:52.476
damn, likes cars, too.

612
00:34:54.213 --> 00:34:56.343
Got yourself a good
one there, son.


613
00:34:56.378 --> 00:34:58.243
- Please, he ain't got shit.

614
00:34:58.279 --> 00:34:59.344
He's my brother.

615
00:34:59.380 --> 00:35:00.277
- Oh, is that right?

616
00:35:00.312 --> 00:35:01.718
- Mm-hm.

617
00:35:01.753 --> 00:35:02.585
- Well.

618
00:35:04.485 --> 00:35:06.218
So what you got under there?

619
00:35:06.253 --> 00:35:07.458
- Underwear.

620
00:35:08.828 --> 00:35:09.994
Just kiddin'.

621
00:35:10.029 --> 00:35:13.424
It's a V8, fuckin' big one, too.

622
00:35:13.459 --> 00:35:14.894
- I'll bet it is.

623
00:35:17.698 --> 00:35:19.432
So what, you gonna
keep it a secret?


624
00:35:19.467 --> 00:35:21.567
- Well, you know what they say,

625
00:35:21.603 --> 00:35:22.933
it's the secret
that's never told


626
00:35:22.968 --> 00:35:26.977
that offers the most
extraordinary suspense.


627
00:35:27.013 --> 00:35:28.240
- Yeah, that's a good one.

628
00:35:28.276 --> 00:35:29.478
Who said that?

629
00:35:29.513 --> 00:35:30.443
- Tell him it's from
Big Daddy Don Garlic.


630
00:35:30.478 --> 00:35:32.749
- Fucking Big Daddy Dan Garlic.

631
00:35:32.784 --> 00:35:33.577
- Don.

632
00:35:33.612 --> 00:35:34.413
- That's what I meant.

633
00:35:34.448 --> 00:35:35.382
- It's Garlets.
- Don.


634
00:35:35.417 --> 00:35:36.753
- And I believe his last was-

635
00:35:36.789 --> 00:35:37.883
- Garlets.

636
00:35:37.952 --> 00:35:40.792
- Oh yeah, he was a hell
of mopar driver, wasn't he?


637
00:35:40.828 --> 00:35:41.753
- Sure as hell was.

638
00:35:41.855 --> 00:35:43.687
Hell, I love the way
he drove them mopers.


639
00:35:43.722 --> 00:35:46.061
He fuckin' owns 'em, he does.

640
00:35:46.096 --> 00:35:47.762
- Hey, look honey,

641
00:35:48.865 --> 00:35:53.202
you got anything you wanna
show off on the way back in,


642
00:35:53.237 --> 00:35:55.472
you just gimme a holler, hear?

643
00:35:55.508 --> 00:35:59.708
- Well you better keep
your ears on, good buddy.


644
00:36:01.113 --> 00:36:02.444
- (clears throat) Well, anyway,

645
00:36:02.479 --> 00:36:04.415
the real reason I
pulled y'all over


646
00:36:04.451 --> 00:36:06.984
is you're about to hit a
stretch of about 30 miles


647
00:36:07.020 --> 00:36:08.517
with no cell phone towers,

648
00:36:08.552 --> 00:36:11.586
and no gas for another

649
00:36:11.621 --> 00:36:14.625
You may wanna keep a
close eye on that gauge.


650
00:36:14.660 --> 00:36:18.689
I mean, you can get gas in
Quicksilver about 12 miles in,


651
00:36:18.724 --> 00:36:21.628
but get in and get outta there.

652
00:36:21.664 --> 00:36:23.732
Mercury got in the
water from that mine


653
00:36:23.768 --> 00:36:27.268
and left them Appalachian
transplants bat shit crazy.


654
00:36:27.303 --> 00:36:29.507
What's left 'em, anyway.

655
00:36:30.538 --> 00:36:33.137
Well, I don't wanna keep y'all.

656
00:36:37.350 --> 00:36:39.247
Hey, you ever let
her drive that thing?


657
00:36:39.282 --> 00:36:40.779
- Every once in a while.

658
00:36:40.814 --> 00:36:43.384
- 'Cause I would
love to see a beauty


659
00:36:43.419 --> 00:36:44.855
behind the wheel of the beauty.

660
00:36:44.891 --> 00:36:45.889
(gun cocking)

661
00:36:45.925 --> 00:36:46.724
What was that?

662
00:36:46.760 --> 00:36:48.125
- Cricket.

663
00:36:48.160 --> 00:36:49.423
Damn things been caught in here

664
00:36:49.458 --> 00:36:51.695
since we got gas in Marathon.

665
00:36:51.730 --> 00:36:53.997
And yeah, I only let him drive
when I need to take a nap.


666
00:36:54.033 --> 00:36:55.830
Let's switch, Tommy.

667
00:37:02.674 --> 00:37:06.406
- If y'all wanna smoke 'em
up on the way outta here,


668
00:37:06.441 --> 00:37:08.071
ain't nobody looking.

669
00:37:08.106 --> 00:37:10.777
You won't see no berries
and cherries from me.


670
00:37:10.813 --> 00:37:15.080
- Well, I'm a give you a
front row seat, law man.


671
00:37:16.089 --> 00:37:19.418
(lively music)
(engine revving)


672
00:37:19.453 --> 00:37:22.494
(tires squealing)

673
00:37:38.043 --> 00:37:41.671
(Magda whimpering)

674
00:37:41.707 --> 00:37:43.210
- Well, this is it.

675
00:37:43.246 --> 00:37:44.775
It, it's humble.

676
00:37:44.810 --> 00:37:47.181
But rooms are clean though.

677
00:37:47.217 --> 00:37:48.685
I, I make sure.

678
00:37:49.653 --> 00:37:52.788
The, the office is
there on the right.


679
00:37:54.257 --> 00:37:57.188
(Magda whimpering)

680
00:38:23.055 --> 00:38:25.755
(tense music)

681
00:38:38.136 --> 00:38:40.935
(phone dialing)

682
00:38:43.042 --> 00:38:45.742
(tense music)

683
00:38:52.580 --> 00:38:54.685
- Hi daddy, it's Molly.

684
00:38:55.752 --> 00:38:59.250
Um, I'm calling from
a motel phone 'cause,


685
00:39:00.427 --> 00:39:03.793
'cause I'm on that
dead spot on the 16.


686
00:39:04.794 --> 00:39:08.061
And I know, I'm sorry,
but, but listen.


687
00:39:10.433 --> 00:39:11.764
(people chattering)

688
00:39:11.800 --> 00:39:14.038
- [Woman] Women
I would like you.


689
00:39:14.074 --> 00:39:16.106
Too bad I like guys.

690
00:39:16.142 --> 00:39:18.239
Like you. (giggling)

691
00:39:18.274 --> 00:39:19.708
- All right.

692
00:39:19.743 --> 00:39:21.605
Find out a lot more
about you than I like.


693
00:39:21.641 --> 00:39:22.977
- I told you...

694
00:39:24.615 --> 00:39:25.810
- Anyway, I hope
you get this soon


695
00:39:25.845 --> 00:39:27.984
so you can come and get me.

696
00:39:28.019 --> 00:39:28.983
Yeah.

697
00:39:31.154 --> 00:39:32.016
Okay.

698
00:39:32.051 --> 00:39:35.121
Hopefully I see
you in the morning.


699
00:39:36.627 --> 00:39:37.992
I love you, daddy.
(tense music)


700
00:39:38.027 --> 00:39:42.733
- Didn't recall you asking
to use any extra services.


701
00:39:43.796 --> 00:39:45.769
- Oh, I'm, I'm sorry.

702
00:39:46.536 --> 00:39:48.604
I just had to make a quick call.

703
00:39:48.639 --> 00:39:51.940
Um, you can add it
to my bill though.


704
00:39:53.878 --> 00:39:58.149
- It was up to me, I, I
wouldn't charge you at all.


705
00:39:58.185 --> 00:40:00.047
Well, five's my favorite.

706
00:40:00.981 --> 00:40:04.681
Just always it's
always smells good.


707
00:40:04.717 --> 00:40:06.289
Don't know why.

708
00:40:06.324 --> 00:40:08.026
- Need a witness, Cleve.

709
00:40:08.061 --> 00:40:09.392
Oh, oh I'm sorry.

710
00:40:09.428 --> 00:40:10.792
I didn't realize
you had company.


711
00:40:10.827 --> 00:40:13.993
- Oh no, no, we, we
was just finishing up.


712
00:40:14.028 --> 00:40:17.298
Oh there, there's free
drinks in the bar later.


713
00:40:17.333 --> 00:40:18.665
- Oh thanks.

714
00:40:18.700 --> 00:40:21.200
I'm, I'm just so tired though.

715
00:40:29.549 --> 00:40:33.047
- Surprised you didn't
rip your britches.


716
00:40:38.124 --> 00:40:40.884
(melancholy music)

717
00:40:40.919 --> 00:40:42.991

Baby.

732
00:41:30.005 --> 00:41:31.169
Pardon, but I always
put my hands together


733
00:41:31.204 --> 00:41:34.944
in the time of need,
and low and behold.


734
00:41:36.008 --> 00:41:37.942
Seems we like the same vintage,

735
00:41:37.977 --> 00:41:40.378
just from a different branch.

736
00:41:41.815 --> 00:41:44.019
Stopped, don't know why.

737
00:41:44.986 --> 00:41:46.256
Think you too could
give me a ride?


738
00:41:46.291 --> 00:41:47.154
- Yes.
- No.


739
00:41:48.755 --> 00:41:50.020
Can't help you.

740
00:41:50.055 --> 00:41:52.256
But this is a friend of mine.

741
00:41:52.292 --> 00:41:56.130
And if you give him a
call, I'm sure he can.


742
00:41:57.368 --> 00:41:59.169
- I'll make due.

743
00:41:59.205 --> 00:42:00.266
- Suit yourself.

744
00:42:02.208 --> 00:42:04.809
(smooth music)

745
00:42:22.525 --> 00:42:24.628
(bells jingling)

746
00:42:24.663 --> 00:42:26.825
- Sorry I had to
step out, Ophelia.


747
00:42:26.860 --> 00:42:27.893
We have a leaky faucet.

748
00:42:27.928 --> 00:42:30.060
I had to put maintenance on it.

749
00:42:30.095 --> 00:42:31.599
So you were saying that uh,

750
00:42:31.634 --> 00:42:32.802
you left your husband

751
00:42:32.837 --> 00:42:34.302
when you met this
fella at a conference?


752
00:42:34.337 --> 00:42:35.365
- I did.

753
00:42:35.401 --> 00:42:39.069
Within the hour, I was
in a car with him and,


754
00:42:39.104 --> 00:42:40.940
and we were leaving everything

755
00:42:40.976 --> 00:42:44.013
that I forgot was
important to me.


756
00:42:47.013 --> 00:42:49.183
David was six when I left.

757
00:42:52.054 --> 00:42:56.927
And, (cries) little
Laurie was three.


758
00:42:58.227 --> 00:43:03.232
I haven't seen or spoke
to my babies in 37 years.


759
00:43:03.268 --> 00:43:04.198
37 years.

760
00:43:06.032 --> 00:43:08.400
- Does it serve you right?

761
00:43:11.510 --> 00:43:13.812
- I suppose it does.
- Hm.


762
00:43:15.145 --> 00:43:19.384
I saw you listed on the
register as an Ophelia Wendall.


763
00:43:19.419 --> 00:43:21.015
Is that your maiden or his?

764
00:43:21.051 --> 00:43:22.279
- Oh no, I never wanted
to change my last name.


765
00:43:22.315 --> 00:43:24.048
- You know, it don't
really seem right


766
00:43:24.083 --> 00:43:25.423
sharing names with little ones

767
00:43:25.458 --> 00:43:28.085
when you only donated the nature

768
00:43:28.120 --> 00:43:30.829
and ran away from the nurture.

769
00:43:32.457 --> 00:43:35.830
Hope you got your heart
right with the Lord.


770
00:43:35.866 --> 00:43:37.097
- I think I'll
take my check now.


771
00:43:37.132 --> 00:43:40.064
- No, no, there's no
check for the truth.


772
00:43:40.099 --> 00:43:42.434
You told it fair and square.

773
00:43:48.039 --> 00:43:49.540
- Have a nice day.

774
00:43:54.420 --> 00:43:56.115
- Well it's settled.

775
00:43:56.151 --> 00:43:59.286
You don't hold no
truck with adultery.


776
00:44:00.555 --> 00:44:01.387
What?

777
00:44:04.328 --> 00:44:05.259
What?

778
00:44:07.332 --> 00:44:08.163
- Nothing.

779
00:44:10.128 --> 00:44:12.667
You got Chisos pegged.

780
00:44:12.702 --> 00:44:13.870
Hell, if he was here, I,

781

I reckon lightning
come down from heaven,


782

strike that adulterer
dead on the spot.


783
00:44:19.275 --> 00:44:22.776
- You know damn well the
Lord don't work like that.


784
00:44:22.811 --> 00:44:24.542
We gotta do his will.

785
00:44:27.014 --> 00:44:28.350
- Well, I'll go tell Cookie now.

786
00:44:28.385 --> 00:44:29.283

812
00:46:03.946 --> 00:46:06.246
fitting for a, a new union.

813
00:46:06.282 --> 00:46:10.219
All right, if uh, y'all
could just sign in here.


814
00:46:10.254 --> 00:46:14.685
Now we have a, a king with
a flower back headboard.


815
00:46:15.693 --> 00:46:17.457
That's uh, uh 40 per.

816
00:46:19.299 --> 00:46:19.956
That okay?

817
00:46:19.991 --> 00:46:20.793
- Mm-hm.

818
00:46:20.828 --> 00:46:22.030
- Oh no, no.

819
00:46:22.065 --> 00:46:22.962
We, we'll settle

821
00:46:27.199 --> 00:46:29.403
- Damn, she's beautiful.

822
00:46:30.443 --> 00:46:31.740
- What's that?

823
00:46:31.776 --> 00:46:34.643
Oh uh, yeah, they all are.

824
00:46:34.679 --> 00:46:36.410
- Who'd a hung her?

825
00:46:37.716 --> 00:46:40.414
- She took the bite, didn't she?

826
00:46:41.315 --> 00:46:44.716
- We'll take the
flower back, please.


827
00:46:44.751 --> 00:46:48.652
- Now there's uh, there's
drinks in the bar after dark.


828
00:46:48.688 --> 00:46:53.463
If y'all sit with Mabel,
just, just give her this.


829
00:46:53.499 --> 00:46:54.624
- Who's Mabel?

830
00:46:54.659 --> 00:46:58.595
- Oh, Maybelline, she,
she's my, she's my wife.


831
00:46:58.630 --> 00:47:02.235
She, she runs the, the
bar and the, the diner.


832
00:47:02.271 --> 00:47:05.303
It gets kind of lonely
out here, so uh,


833
00:47:05.339 --> 00:47:07.578
so ifin y'all got
a story to tell,


834
00:47:07.614 --> 00:47:10.074
she'll be happy to listen.

835
00:47:10.110 --> 00:47:11.547
First two are free.

836
00:47:11.583 --> 00:47:13.143
What's TOT mean?

837
00:47:13.178 --> 00:47:14.951
- Table of truth.

838
00:47:14.986 --> 00:47:17.648
And uh, she'll know
if you're lying.


839
00:47:17.684 --> 00:47:20.458
- We can't miss out on
an opportunity like that,


840
00:47:20.493 --> 00:47:21.686
now can we, baby?

841
00:47:30.636 --> 00:47:32.397
- Did they move the car?

842
00:47:32.432 --> 00:47:33.833
- It's right in
front of the room.


843
00:47:33.869 --> 00:47:36.536
(intense music)

844
00:47:37.538 --> 00:47:39.974
- I got it all topped
off and ready for you.


845
00:47:40.009 --> 00:47:42.176
Parked it in front of your room.

846
00:47:42.211 --> 00:47:45.546
Even washed the
windshield for you.


847
00:47:45.581 --> 00:47:48.451
- Hey, you mind if I freshen
up and meet you at the bar?


848
00:47:48.486 --> 00:47:49.318
- Okay.

849
00:47:51.324 --> 00:47:52.523
Hey.

850
00:47:52.558 --> 00:47:54.257
- [Penelope] Yeah?

851
00:47:55.258 --> 00:47:57.057
- Can I swat you on the
ass as you walk away?


852
00:47:57.092 --> 00:47:59.592
I, I always wanted to do that.

853
00:48:02.361 --> 00:48:04.861
- You don't have to ask, baby.

854
00:48:07.771 --> 00:48:09.140
Just swing it.

855
00:48:10.543 --> 00:48:13.375
(endearing music)

856
00:48:19.717 --> 00:48:22.219
(eerie music)

857
00:48:32.224 --> 00:48:34.891
(ominous music)

858
00:49:00.659 --> 00:49:03.458
(Cookie grunting)

859
00:49:08.426 --> 00:49:11.035
- I'm sorry about this,

860
00:49:11.070 --> 00:49:14.067
But you shouldn't have
done what you done.


861
00:49:14.103 --> 00:49:16.471
Don't worry, we'll fix ya.

862
00:49:17.777 --> 00:49:19.804
Right after I fix this one.

863
00:49:23.044 --> 00:49:24.240
(flesh squelching)

864
00:49:24.276 --> 00:49:26.778
(tense music)

865
00:49:39.698 --> 00:49:42.563
(ominous music)

866
00:49:46.639 --> 00:49:47.296
(Molly gasps)

867
00:49:47.332 --> 00:49:49.834
(tense music)

868
00:50:02.921 --> 00:50:04.453
I think that girl heard me.

869
00:50:04.488 --> 00:50:06.222
And, and then she was, she
was staring right at me.


870
00:50:06.257 --> 00:50:08.359
- And what would she
have heard, Cookie?


871
00:50:08.394 --> 00:50:12.296
The sound of a wrinkly old lady
being strung up by her foot?


872
00:50:12.331 --> 00:50:13.892
She couldn't even name that
tune with all the notes.


873
00:50:13.927 --> 00:50:15.758
- You didn't tell me there was
somebody in the corner room.


874
00:50:15.793 --> 00:50:17.801
- Well, I just
checked her in today.


875
00:50:17.837 --> 00:50:18.728
- But you didn't tell me.

876
00:50:18.763 --> 00:50:20.533
There wasn't supposed
to be nobody.


877
00:50:20.568 --> 00:50:23.371
I wouldn't have been
carrying that lady's,


878
00:50:23.406 --> 00:50:24.536
I mean, if I knew that
there was somebody


879
00:50:24.572 --> 00:50:25.709
I wouldn't have been
carrying the leg.


880
00:50:25.745 --> 00:50:27.311
- Okay, okay, okay.

881
00:50:28.011 --> 00:50:29.742
I'll go check on her.

882
00:50:33.818 --> 00:50:35.949
(knocking on door)

883
00:50:35.985 --> 00:50:37.387
- [Cleve] Miss?

884
00:50:39.221 --> 00:50:41.655
You, you, you okay in there?

885
00:50:42.860 --> 00:50:43.954
- Yep, all good.

886
00:50:47.600 --> 00:50:48.497
- Oh, okay.

887
00:50:50.136 --> 00:50:52.828
Well, you know, I
was, I was just uh,


888
00:50:52.864 --> 00:50:55.799
I was just checking
on you 'cause um,


889
00:50:55.834 --> 00:50:59.002
'cause, 'cause you ain't
take no dinner and,


890
00:50:59.038 --> 00:51:01.804
and hell you, you ain't poked
your head out all night.


891
00:51:01.839 --> 00:51:05.112
So uh, so I was just
checking on you.


892
00:51:05.148 --> 00:51:07.816
Make sure you, you's okay.

893
00:51:07.851 --> 00:51:08.578
- I'm okay.

894
00:51:08.613 --> 00:51:11.683
I just, I just get migraines.

895
00:51:11.718 --> 00:51:14.517
- Oh, I could bring
you something if, if,


896
00:51:14.552 --> 00:51:16.892
ifin that would help.

897
00:51:16.928 --> 00:51:18.692
- Nope, that's okay.

898
00:51:19.490 --> 00:51:20.892
- Oh, sure, sure.

899
00:51:23.929 --> 00:51:28.339
Well, I just, I just um,
I, I just wanna say um,


900
00:51:29.667 --> 00:51:32.409
I'm, I'm sorry about before.

901
00:51:33.845 --> 00:51:34.906
When I, when I,

902
00:51:36.542 --> 00:51:38.976
when I touched-
- That's okay.


903
00:51:40.883 --> 00:51:41.715
- Okay.

904
00:51:52.029 --> 00:51:53.727
All right then, uh.

905
00:51:56.702 --> 00:51:57.500
Goodnight.

906
00:52:01.872 --> 00:52:02.868
- Goodnight.

907
00:52:07.978 --> 00:52:10.678
(tense music)

908
00:52:19.154 --> 00:52:21.755
(eerie music)

909
00:52:24.794 --> 00:52:27.930
- Chisos says most people
take double helpings of a lie


910
00:52:27.965 --> 00:52:29.827
if it tastes good.

911
00:52:29.863 --> 00:52:32.768
Leave a healthy plate of
truth out for the dogs.


912
00:52:32.804 --> 00:52:33.635
- Not me.

913
00:52:35.640 --> 00:52:38.305
- Yeah, I guess it depends on
who you're sinning against.


914
00:52:38.340 --> 00:52:39.869
- Chisos words don't lie, child.

915
00:52:39.904 --> 00:52:43.106
- Wait a minute,
who's Cheese Sauce?


916
00:52:43.981 --> 00:52:45.141
- It's Chisos.

917
00:52:46.552 --> 00:52:49.281
Ain't nothing more powerful
than won't come outta his mouth.


918
00:52:49.317 --> 00:52:50.685
And I seen his words

919
00:52:50.720 --> 00:52:53.749
bring a screaming freight
train to a complete stop.


920
00:52:53.784 --> 00:52:56.827
- You mean like an actual train?

921
00:52:56.863 --> 00:52:57.854
- Like a choo choo?

922
00:52:57.889 --> 00:53:00.729
- Yes, darling, an
actual choo choo.


923
00:53:00.764 --> 00:53:02.962
He done it from the front
window in the diner upstairs.


924
00:53:02.997 --> 00:53:05.764
A bunch of doubters heard the
Stud of Butte line coming.


925
00:53:05.799 --> 00:53:09.671
He rose up and held out
his hands like this,


926
00:53:10.935 --> 00:53:12.903
said a few of
those Gaelic words.


927
00:53:12.938 --> 00:53:15.773
You could hear those
brakes from miles away.


928
00:53:15.808 --> 00:53:18.812
All 36 cars come
to a complete stop.


929
00:53:19.747 --> 00:53:22.549
Few more words, he
even made it back up.


930
00:53:22.585 --> 00:53:24.051
- You sure it wasn't
just side tracked?


931
00:53:24.087 --> 00:53:25.054
(bells jingling)

932
00:53:25.089 --> 00:53:26.985
- It was side tracking.

933
00:53:28.889 --> 00:53:31.894
I'm sure you two have
seen it done to a car.


934
00:53:31.929 --> 00:53:32.788
Am I right?

935
00:53:32.823 --> 00:53:34.590
- I see you got it running, huh?

936
00:53:34.626 --> 00:53:36.498
- It's just a fuse.

937
00:53:36.533 --> 00:53:38.133
Just a little tickle
with my middle finger


938
00:53:38.168 --> 00:53:39.998
and it fired right up.

939
00:53:42.506 --> 00:53:46.043
- Oh my God, baby, did
you just hear that?


940
00:53:46.078 --> 00:53:47.641
Somewhere off in the distance

941
00:53:47.676 --> 00:53:51.449
a freight train just
made a fucking U-turn.


942
00:53:52.115 --> 00:53:53.850
(people laughing)

943
00:53:53.886 --> 00:53:54.884
- I'm Chisos.

944
00:53:54.920 --> 00:53:56.247
- Oh, I'm Frank.

945
00:53:56.282 --> 00:53:57.081
- Frank.

946
00:53:58.288 --> 00:54:00.791
Hey, you two are honeymooners.

947
00:54:00.827 --> 00:54:01.420
Is that right?

948
00:54:01.455 --> 00:54:03.026
- Yeah, that's right.

949
00:54:03.061 --> 00:54:04.120
We got your king size

950
00:54:04.155 --> 00:54:06.755
with the flower back
headboard and everything.


951
00:54:06.791 --> 00:54:08.757
We'll try not to wake you.

952
00:54:08.793 --> 00:54:10.534
- You know what they say,

953
00:54:10.570 --> 00:54:13.565
you throw a lie in a river
five days before the truth,


954
00:54:13.600 --> 00:54:15.303
the truth is gonna catch up.

955
00:54:15.338 --> 00:54:18.375
- Especially at this table.

956
00:54:18.410 --> 00:54:21.477
- Most don't make it out
here without a reason.


957
00:54:21.512 --> 00:54:24.513
Being that we're off
the beaten path and all.


958
00:54:24.549 --> 00:54:27.680
So tell me, where are
you newly weds headed?


959
00:54:27.715 --> 00:54:29.954
- Well, see, as a,
as a wedding gift,


960
00:54:29.989 --> 00:54:30.714
my new husband, yeah,

961
00:54:30.749 --> 00:54:31.949
he's promised to take me down

962
00:54:31.984 --> 00:54:33.956
the prettiest road in
the whole fuckin' world.


963
00:54:33.992 --> 00:54:34.918
- Oh well, you-

964
00:54:34.954 --> 00:54:36.060
- Well this is the
wrong part of the world


965
00:54:36.095 --> 00:54:38.295
to find the prettiest road.

966
00:54:38.330 --> 00:54:40.522
- Yeah, it ain't
in this stink hole.


967
00:54:40.558 --> 00:54:41.928
It's west.

968
00:54:41.963 --> 00:54:44.727
My baby here, he said that
he saw it in some movie,


969
00:54:44.762 --> 00:54:46.697
uh, "Thelma & Louise."

970
00:54:46.732 --> 00:54:48.236
It's this road that they go down

971
00:54:48.271 --> 00:54:49.704
at the end of the movie,

972
00:54:49.740 --> 00:54:53.744
and my baby here, he's
gonna take me for a ride.


973
00:54:53.779 --> 00:54:54.611
- Wow.

974
00:54:55.579 --> 00:54:58.477
What a generous and
kind man you are.


975
00:54:58.512 --> 00:55:00.817
I've seen that movie.

976
00:55:00.852 --> 00:55:02.114
Amazing.

977
00:55:02.149 --> 00:55:07.118
To see two love birds about
to take each other for a ride.


978
00:55:08.127 --> 00:55:10.688
You mind if I join you two?

979
00:55:10.723 --> 00:55:12.661
- Well only if you have a story.

980
00:55:12.697 --> 00:55:15.459
You know, seeing as how
that's the rules and all.


981
00:55:15.495 --> 00:55:16.692
- Get us two.

982
00:55:16.727 --> 00:55:17.968
- Just, just two?

983
00:55:18.003 --> 00:55:19.397
- Just for us men.

984
00:55:19.433 --> 00:55:20.703
- [Mabel] Oh.

985
00:55:21.637 --> 00:55:24.768
- So uh, what is
it you do out here?


986
00:55:24.803 --> 00:55:26.674
- But the short version though,

987
00:55:26.709 --> 00:55:29.808
'cause I'm about ready
for that headboard.


988
00:55:29.843 --> 00:55:32.445
- Well the truth
can't be truncated.


989
00:55:32.480 --> 00:55:34.310
- Well, try your best.

990
00:55:36.484 --> 00:55:38.488
- How's this for Cliffs?

991
00:55:38.523 --> 00:55:41.887
Family came out from
Appalachia in 1903.


992
00:55:41.922 --> 00:55:43.922
This mine's been in my
family for generations.


993
00:55:43.957 --> 00:55:47.031
We were the mercury
capital of the world,


994
00:55:47.066 --> 00:55:48.829
till the mine collapsed.

995
00:55:48.865 --> 00:55:51.163
My grandfather was trapped
underneath that mine.


996
00:55:51.198 --> 00:55:54.765
He was leading a prison work
release program for murderers,


997
00:55:54.800 --> 00:55:57.735
rapists, all kinds of filth.

998
00:55:57.770 --> 00:56:00.037
They were left there for dead,

999
00:56:00.072 --> 00:56:02.409
until he came walking
out 11 days later


1000
00:56:02.444 --> 00:56:03.808
when the plate shifted.

1001
00:56:03.844 --> 00:56:05.175
He was the only
one that made it.


1002
00:56:05.211 --> 00:56:09.686
Three dead felons left
below, gnawed to the bone.


1003
00:56:10.715 --> 00:56:12.251
- That's crazy.

1004
00:56:12.286 --> 00:56:16.520
- See my grandfather,
he survived by
eating those sinners,


1005
00:56:16.556 --> 00:56:17.991
organs and all.

1006
00:56:19.196 --> 00:56:20.824
Not a secret.

1007
00:56:20.859 --> 00:56:22.894
Made the papers everywhere.

1008
00:56:22.930 --> 00:56:25.666
What is a secret is
that we are still


1009
00:56:25.701 --> 00:56:28.502
Appalachian sin
eaters at our core.


1010
00:56:28.537 --> 00:56:29.699
We have been for centuries.

1011
00:56:29.734 --> 00:56:31.169
It's in our blood.

1012
00:56:31.204 --> 00:56:34.304
So all the drifters, the
travelers, all the runners,


1013
00:56:34.340 --> 00:56:38.749
they come and sit down here
at this table and confess,


1014
00:56:38.784 --> 00:56:41.815
and we consume in proportion
to the severity of the sin.


1015
00:56:41.850 --> 00:56:44.949
Sometimes it's just
a BB behind the ear.


1016
00:56:44.985 --> 00:56:48.488
Sometimes it's an
unsurvivable filet,


1017
00:56:48.524 --> 00:56:50.720
enough for a table of six.

1018
00:56:50.755 --> 00:56:52.191
- What's he doing?

1019
00:56:52.226 --> 00:56:54.929
- What he always does when
he ain't gonna let 'em leave.


1020
00:56:54.964 --> 00:56:57.031
Fills them with a truth
that's too hard to believe.


1021
00:56:57.066 --> 00:57:00.534
- We take the cell phones
down the Juarez, we dump 'em.


1022
00:57:00.569 --> 00:57:03.234
We burn the bodies and the cars.

1023
00:57:04.674 --> 00:57:06.341
No one has any
idea that it is us


1024
00:57:06.376 --> 00:57:07.544
that takes on the burden

1025
00:57:07.579 --> 00:57:10.579
that the world would
otherwise have to carry.


1026
00:57:10.614 --> 00:57:12.381
I'm equal opportunity
to at fault,


1027
00:57:12.416 --> 00:57:15.048
even when it comes to myself.

1028
00:57:16.016 --> 00:57:19.415
Sometimes I consume a
taste of my own sin.


1029
00:57:20.654 --> 00:57:22.257
- Ugh.
- Jesus Christ.


1030
00:57:22.293 --> 00:57:24.057
- I'm just kidding.

1031
00:57:26.056 --> 00:57:28.930
But the train part, that's true.

1032
00:57:29.794 --> 00:57:31.295
At will on a dime.

1033
00:57:32.669 --> 00:57:34.104
And just not
inanimate locomotives.


1034
00:57:34.139 --> 00:57:35.598
- Like what else?

1035
00:57:35.634 --> 00:57:36.768
- People.

1036
00:57:36.803 --> 00:57:38.002
I know all about incentives,

1037
00:57:38.037 --> 00:57:41.274
motivations and
overall psychology.


1038
00:57:41.309 --> 00:57:42.141
- Okay.

1039
00:57:43.544 --> 00:57:44.946
Try me, Freud.

1040
00:57:49.084 --> 00:57:53.521
- My family owned over

1041
00:57:53.556 --> 00:57:55.220
but now I'm the only one left.

1042
00:57:55.256 --> 00:58:00.093
So last April, I sold almost
all of it for $24 million.


1043
00:58:02.996 --> 00:58:05.532
Now I have no one
to spend it on.


1044
00:58:05.568 --> 00:58:07.970
No one to give me a child.

1045
00:58:08.005 --> 00:58:12.172
And I really want one, for
more than just legacy reasons.


1046
00:58:12.207 --> 00:58:15.707
That modest little house up
there at the top of the hill,


1047
00:58:15.742 --> 00:58:17.880
you might have seen it.

1048
00:58:18.944 --> 00:58:21.213
All of it could be yours.

1049
00:58:23.050 --> 00:58:27.021
I'm honest and faithful,
almost to a fault.


1050
00:58:29.823 --> 00:58:32.488
So if any of that interests you,

1051
00:58:33.962 --> 00:58:37.460
then get up and head
out to the white car.


1052
00:58:40.303 --> 00:58:40.897
- 'Nelope.

1053
00:58:40.932 --> 00:58:41.831
- I'll meet you there.

1054
00:58:41.867 --> 00:58:42.999
(people chattering)

1055
00:58:43.034 --> 00:58:44.233
- I'm gonna have a word here

1056
00:58:44.269 --> 00:58:46.936
and make sure he's
equally compensated.


1057
00:58:46.971 --> 00:58:49.142
- 'Nelope, look at me.

1058
00:58:50.644 --> 00:58:52.442
'Nelope, 'Nelope!

1059
00:58:52.477 --> 00:58:57.887
- Son, son, son, she's a
stripper, she's a grifter.


1060
00:58:58.421 --> 00:58:59.152
They all sell it.

1061
00:59:00.386 --> 00:59:02.191
If she hasn't taken you
for everything, she will.


1062
00:59:02.227 --> 00:59:03.354
- No, she's not.

1063
00:59:05.160 --> 00:59:08.426
- So I'm gonna get a nice
little wad of cash for ya.


1064
00:59:08.461 --> 00:59:13.430
When you check out, it'll help
to heal that broken heart.


1065
00:59:24.111 --> 00:59:28.082
- Morning coffee if he
won't take it today.


1066
00:59:30.721 --> 00:59:33.616
- Hey, aren't you
gonna finish that?


1067
00:59:33.651 --> 00:59:37.490
It's a wonderful vintage of
distilled damnation right there.


1068
00:59:37.526 --> 00:59:40.193
(hand slamming)

1069
01:00:21.735 --> 01:00:23.236
- [Penelope] Hey.

1070
01:00:25.070 --> 01:00:28.076
- God damn I love you, 'Nelope.

1071
01:00:33.144 --> 01:00:36.580
- Sorry, I had to tinkle,

1072
01:00:36.615 --> 01:00:42.255
and I couldn't take any more
of that garbage he was spewing.


1073
01:00:44.059 --> 01:00:48.157
Hey, you know all those
ways you never told me


1074
01:00:48.192 --> 01:00:51.228
how you were gonna fuck me?

1075
01:00:51.263 --> 01:00:53.197
Well, could you just
forget about 'em


1076
01:00:53.233 --> 01:00:56.472
and come over here
and make love to me


1077
01:00:56.507 --> 01:00:58.370
for a really long time?

1078
01:01:00.944 --> 01:01:04.874
- After that, girl, you
don't even get a say.

(tense music)

1090
01:02:19.656 --> 01:02:22.319
- The tow truck driver,

1091
01:02:22.354 --> 01:02:25.358
he put, he put his
hand on my, on...

I'm okay though.

(tense music)

1094
01:02:44.583 --> 01:02:46.146
- You fucked up really bad,

1095
01:02:46.181 --> 01:02:48.482
and you're gonna have
to make it right.


1096
01:02:48.517 --> 01:02:49.382
- Okay.

1097
01:02:50.483 --> 01:02:52.220
- You got a newborn not
two months in the ground


1098
01:02:52.256 --> 01:02:55.456
and you're already letting
your lustful ways lead you.


1099
01:02:55.491 --> 01:02:56.290
- Do I?

1100
01:02:57.427 --> 01:02:58.726
Do I?

1101
01:02:58.762 --> 01:02:59.794
- What do you whine about?

1102
01:02:59.829 --> 01:03:02.595
- Oh shut up, just shut up.

1103
01:03:02.630 --> 01:03:04.134
- What?

1104
01:03:04.169 --> 01:03:08.201
- You tell me how Mabel give
me a, a boy two months ago,


1105
01:03:08.236 --> 01:03:11.739
and she ain't late with
me in, in three years.


1106
01:03:11.774 --> 01:03:13.069
You tell me how, huh?

1107
01:03:13.105 --> 01:03:15.477

(ominous music)

1109

- 19 Calls from her
daddy to this number


1110
01:03:27.086 --> 01:03:28.751
starting at 6:24 AM.

1111
01:03:30.162 --> 01:03:32.492
I researched the number, he's
a Sanctus County Sheriff.


1112
01:03:32.527 --> 01:03:37.430
He'll be 616 South, and Cookie
said she saw him holding-


1113
01:03:38.765 --> 01:03:39.597
- Go.

1114
01:03:44.705 --> 01:03:45.537
You too.

- Come on, daddy.

1118
01:04:18.510 --> 01:04:19.472
Where are you?

1119
01:04:20.474 --> 01:04:22.805
- God damn I love waking
up next to you, 'Nelope.


1120
01:04:22.840 --> 01:04:25.274
- I can't believe you
thought I was gonna leave you


1121
01:04:25.309 --> 01:04:27.282
for the Cheese Sauce.

1122

That idiot doesn't stand
a chance against my Frank.


1123
01:04:33.420 --> 01:04:35.021
- [Frank] We're
stuck together, baby.

01:04:35.056 --> 01:04:37.956
- Like hot gum on tarmac stuck.

1125
01:04:37.991 --> 01:04:41.562
(whimsical music)

1126
01:04:41.598 --> 01:04:42.495
Holy shit.

1127
01:04:43.931 --> 01:04:45.234
Is this real?

1128
01:04:45.867 --> 01:04:47.303
- Is that another?

1129
01:04:47.338 --> 01:04:52.538
- Oh my God, a Bugs Bunny level
of karats if I ever did see.


1130
01:04:55.474 --> 01:04:57.072
- With this diamond
will thee wed?


1131
01:04:57.107 --> 01:04:58.148
- Don't!

1132
01:04:59.383 --> 01:05:02.715
And don't you never do that
again, unless you mean it.


1133
01:05:02.750 --> 01:05:03.582
- Okay.

1134
01:05:05.822 --> 01:05:07.589
I was just kidding.

1135
01:05:07.625 --> 01:05:08.523
- I'm serious.

1136
01:05:08.558 --> 01:05:09.522
- Okay.

1137
01:05:10.958 --> 01:05:12.525
- I'm not a joke.

1138
01:05:14.629 --> 01:05:18.700
- Swear to God I'm gonna
surprise you one day, 'Nelope.


1139
01:05:18.736 --> 01:05:20.401
- They's just words.

1140
01:05:49.468 --> 01:05:50.299
- Morning.

1141
01:05:51.266 --> 01:05:53.503
Just uh, two for
breakfast, please.


1142
01:05:53.539 --> 01:05:54.801
(tense music)

1143
01:05:54.837 --> 01:05:57.570
(bell dinging)

1144
01:05:59.404 --> 01:06:02.407
- Uh, yeah, anywhere you want.

1145
01:06:02.442 --> 01:06:05.578
- I'm a go with
them cakes, Cookie.


1146
01:06:07.444 --> 01:06:10.112
Damn, this is amazing.

1147
01:06:10.147 --> 01:06:11.188
- Hm?

1148
01:06:12.218 --> 01:06:14.257
- My dad was a Marine.

1149
01:06:15.561 --> 01:06:17.187
- You two close?

1150
01:06:17.223 --> 01:06:18.888
- Yeah, were really.

1151
01:06:22.998 --> 01:06:24.894
Lost him when I was 16.

1152
01:06:25.802 --> 01:06:27.336
- Oh, I'm sorry.

1153
01:06:28.270 --> 01:06:31.571
- Don't be, 'cause
my 16 with him


1154
01:06:31.607 --> 01:06:36.510
was better than 100 would've
been with any lesser man.


1155
01:06:38.614 --> 01:06:43.814
I planned enlisting myself,
but uh, after my dad died,


1156
01:06:44.782 --> 01:06:48.225
I had to take care of my
mom and little sister.


1157
01:06:49.192 --> 01:06:51.921
- I bet he's proud
of you, Frank.


1158
01:06:52.894 --> 01:06:53.725
- Hope so.

1159
01:06:55.995 --> 01:06:56.827
- He is.

1160
01:06:59.002 --> 01:07:01.304
And what about you, Frank?

1161
01:07:02.238 --> 01:07:04.708
Do you want any
babies of your own?


1162
01:07:04.743 --> 01:07:06.639
- Never not wanted 'em.

1163
01:07:13.144 --> 01:07:13.976
You?

1164
01:07:17.988 --> 01:07:20.521
- Well, I haven't until now.

1165
01:07:45.848 --> 01:07:47.242
Take him.

1166
01:07:47.277 --> 01:07:48.816
- What?

1167
01:07:48.851 --> 01:07:49.682
- Take him.

1168
01:07:52.185 --> 01:07:55.017
(endearing music)

1169
01:08:08.698 --> 01:08:10.634
- Get your ass outta the car.

1170
01:08:10.669 --> 01:08:11.834
What did I tell ya?
- No, please!


1171
01:08:11.869 --> 01:08:13.643
- What the, you're
the one that made me-


1172
01:08:13.679 --> 01:08:14.677
(sirens blaring)

1173
01:08:14.712 --> 01:08:16.009
- Take him.

1174
01:08:16.044 --> 01:08:17.710
Take him with you.

1175
01:08:18.509 --> 01:08:20.614
He'll be our protector.

1176
01:08:21.620 --> 01:08:22.451
Your dad.

1177
01:08:23.381 --> 01:08:25.919
(Magda whimpering)

1178
01:08:25.955 --> 01:08:27.287
Just take him.

1179
01:08:27.323 --> 01:08:30.619
(Magda squealing)
(bell dinging)


1180
01:08:30.655 --> 01:08:32.958
(sirens blaring)
(Cleve yelling)


1181
01:08:32.993 --> 01:08:33.825
- Hey!

1182
01:08:35.395 --> 01:08:37.664
Hey, knock that shit off.

1183
01:08:38.332 --> 01:08:40.265
Get your hands off of her!

1184
01:08:40.301 --> 01:08:41.868
Turn around, turn around.

1185
01:08:41.904 --> 01:08:42.831
- She was-

1186
01:08:42.867 --> 01:08:46.035
- Turn around, put
your hands on the hood.


1187
01:08:47.812 --> 01:08:48.611
You okay, sweetie?

1188
01:08:48.646 --> 01:08:49.340
- Yeah.

1189
01:08:49.375 --> 01:08:50.074
- Yeah?
- I'm okay.


1190
01:08:50.110 --> 01:08:51.547
Thank you.

1191
01:08:51.582 --> 01:08:54.181
- What kind of man puts his
hands on a lady like that, huh?


1192
01:08:54.216 --> 01:08:55.179
What is wrong with you, boy?

1193
01:08:55.215 --> 01:08:57.852
(gunshot firing)

1194
01:08:57.888 --> 01:09:00.489
(hopeful music)

1195
01:09:01.753 --> 01:09:05.892
(Magda squealing)
(bell dinging)


1196
01:09:05.927 --> 01:09:06.759
- Hey!

1197
01:09:08.964 --> 01:09:10.700
- Freeze!

1198
01:09:10.736 --> 01:09:11.764
Uh, something!

1199
01:09:13.766 --> 01:09:16.631
- Yeah, freeze it right,
you fuckin' weirdo!


1200
01:09:16.667 --> 01:09:18.873
- 'Nelope, go get the car.

1201
01:09:18.908 --> 01:09:19.634
- I'm on it.

1202
01:09:19.670 --> 01:09:22.670
- You, drop that shotgun!

1203
01:09:22.706 --> 01:09:24.876
And you, shut the fuck up!

1204
01:09:28.786 --> 01:09:29.617
Thank you.

1205
01:09:31.053 --> 01:09:33.786
(hopeful music)

1206
01:09:46.070 --> 01:09:48.768
- What the hell just happened?

1207
01:09:50.302 --> 01:09:51.441
Turn right.

1208
01:09:52.304 --> 01:09:53.443
Turn right.

1209
01:09:54.309 --> 01:09:56.809
Turn right you motherfucker.

1210
01:09:58.883 --> 01:10:01.814
(tires screeching)

1211
01:10:06.484 --> 01:10:09.151
(phone ringing)

1212
01:10:10.654 --> 01:10:12.790
Two in the green car.

1213
01:10:12.825 --> 01:10:15.996
- Copy that, they
will not get past us.


1214
01:10:16.032 --> 01:10:18.831
(ominous music)

1215
01:10:28.705 --> 01:10:30.339
- Speak of the devil.

1216
01:10:30.374 --> 01:10:31.574
- Fuck.

1217
01:10:31.609 --> 01:10:33.813
They're making a U-turn.

1218
01:10:36.547 --> 01:10:37.850
- Go, go, go.

1219
01:10:43.455 --> 01:10:44.723
- It's okay, baby.

1220
01:10:44.758 --> 01:10:46.588
It's probably just
that guy from before.


1221
01:10:46.624 --> 01:10:48.963
I think he likes me.

1222
01:10:48.999 --> 01:10:51.468
(tense music)

1223
01:11:06.951 --> 01:11:08.012
- Who's that?

1224
01:11:10.150 --> 01:11:10.982
- Hm.

1225
01:11:14.024 --> 01:11:14.683
(Frank grunting)

1226
01:11:14.718 --> 01:11:16.859
Hey, where's my buddy?

1227
01:11:16.895 --> 01:11:17.925
(Penelope gasps)

1228
01:11:17.960 --> 01:11:18.792
Frank!

1229

(taser buzzing)
(intense music)


1230
01:11:41.084 --> 01:11:42.985
- Hey, hey, hey!

1231
01:11:43.021 --> 01:11:44.548
Hey, the, the girl!

1232
01:11:44.583 --> 01:11:46.217
- You bring the long?

1233
01:11:46.252 --> 01:11:47.051
- Uh.

1234
01:11:48.353 --> 01:11:49.152

I ain't touching it.

and get her stowed.

He's on his way and we've
got a burden to consume.

Hey, use this if there's a need.

(Mabel gasps)

1283
01:18:36.767 --> 01:18:39.135
Get her cleaned
and ready for me.


1284
01:18:39.170 --> 01:18:40.002
- Okay.

1285

01:19:22.545 --> 01:19:23.606
Gentle touch.

1289
01:19:24.507 --> 01:19:26.879
- Ain't you supposed
to sponge it?


1290
01:19:26.914 --> 01:19:29.016
- Told you, I ain't touching it.

1291
01:19:29.052 --> 01:19:32.714
- You wanna sponge it
head to toe, go ahead.


1292
01:19:38.794 --> 01:19:41.326
You just don't understand,

1293
01:19:41.362 --> 01:19:45.562
there ain't no harvest
between our whore's legs.


1294
01:19:53.104 --> 01:19:56.408
(Penelope whimpering)

1295
01:20:20.904 --> 01:20:24.106
- Dear Lord, we
take this Eucharist,


1296
01:20:25.308 --> 01:20:28.638
your your last living gift,
the righteous man's sustenance,


1297
01:20:28.674 --> 01:20:33.178
and we thank you Lord for
bringing us a fertile vessel


1298
01:20:33.213 --> 01:20:35.510
so that we may
continue your work,


1299
01:20:35.546 --> 01:20:38.414
to discern the sheep
from the shepherd,


1300
01:20:38.450 --> 01:20:41.783
and only then will
we dine and cleanse


1301
01:20:43.386 --> 01:20:46.095
until the sheep are no more.

1302
01:20:48.297 --> 01:20:51.292
- [Followers] Wash me
thoroughly from my iniquities,


1303
01:20:51.328 --> 01:20:54.270
and cleanse me from my...

1304
01:20:54.305 --> 01:20:55.636
- Sin.

1305
01:20:55.672 --> 01:20:57.472
- [Followers] Amen.

1306
01:20:57.508 --> 01:20:59.768
(tense music)

1307
01:21:21.191 --> 01:21:24.133
(Frank grunting)

1308
01:21:40.412 --> 01:21:42.517
- You tried longer
than all of them.


1309
01:21:42.553 --> 01:21:45.418
(Frank panting)

1310
01:21:47.756 --> 01:21:49.525
- Where is she?

1311
01:21:49.560 --> 01:21:51.191
- Waiting for me.

1312
01:21:51.226 --> 01:21:54.691
- No, no she's not,
and she never will be.


1313
01:21:56.362 --> 01:21:57.799
- Oh, I think
you'll be surprised.


1314
01:21:57.834 --> 01:22:00.427
- No, I won't be, not this time.

1315
01:22:00.463 --> 01:22:01.563
I've waited my whole life

1316
01:22:01.598 --> 01:22:03.334
to spend the last

1317
01:22:03.369 --> 01:22:04.632
and even if that's
all I ever get,


1318
01:22:04.668 --> 01:22:07.175
it'll dwarf anything
you've ever felt.


1319
01:22:07.211 --> 01:22:10.139
She and I have a love not
even death could steal,


1320
01:22:10.174 --> 01:22:11.543
and you know that.

1321
01:22:11.578 --> 01:22:14.210
It's the kind you've only
ever read about in books,


1322
01:22:14.245 --> 01:22:16.381
and you'll never get it.

1323
01:22:16.416 --> 01:22:18.618
- You know what I hate
more than anything?


1324
01:22:18.654 --> 01:22:19.914
Hypocrisy.

1325
01:22:19.950 --> 01:22:22.991
The whole world's full of
uneducated finger pointers,


1326
01:22:23.026 --> 01:22:25.453
pointing mostly
at people like me.


1327
01:22:25.488 --> 01:22:28.425
But make no mistake about it,

1328
01:22:28.460 --> 01:22:31.832
we save souls from
eternal damnation.


1329
01:22:31.868 --> 01:22:34.168
That's what sin eaters do.

1330
01:22:34.204 --> 01:22:37.072
Son, that's a 60 gallon
drum of purified water.


1331
01:22:37.108 --> 01:22:39.973
That's survival for at
least a couple weeks.


1332
01:22:40.008 --> 01:22:42.574
Unless, of course, you starve.

1333
01:22:46.078 --> 01:22:47.579
So tell me, punk,

1334
01:22:49.418 --> 01:22:53.318
how long until you take a
bite and become one of us.


1335
01:22:53.353 --> 01:22:55.088
- If you touch her,
I swear to God,


1336
01:22:55.124 --> 01:22:57.886
somehow, someday,
I will find you.


1337
01:23:00.160 --> 01:23:02.490
- This isn't a Batman episode.

1338
01:23:02.525 --> 01:23:05.432
You're not getting outta here.

1339
01:23:08.099 --> 01:23:08.930
- 'Nelope!

1340
01:23:10.001 --> 01:23:10.833
'Nelope!

1341
01:23:11.872 --> 01:23:12.802
I'm coming!

1342
01:23:23.214 --> 01:23:24.583
- Where is he?

1343
01:23:26.689 --> 01:23:27.883
Is he dead?

1344
01:23:27.919 --> 01:23:32.453
- One thing's for sure,
he's, he's not coming for ya.


1345
01:23:32.488 --> 01:23:34.828
- You don't know Frank.

1346
01:23:34.864 --> 01:23:36.628
- Oh, I think I do.

1347
01:23:37.735 --> 01:23:39.300
- What do you want?

1348
01:23:39.336 --> 01:23:41.535
- What you've been giving
away your entire life.


1349
01:23:41.570 --> 01:23:43.935
All of a sudden I want it and
you take it off the shelf?


1350
01:23:43.970 --> 01:23:45.003
Why is that?

1351
01:23:45.039 --> 01:23:46.638
- I ain't for sale.

1352
01:23:47.810 --> 01:23:49.342
I never have been.

1353
01:23:49.378 --> 01:23:51.339
- I bet there's a lot of
inflated dicks out there


1354
01:23:51.375 --> 01:23:52.581
that would disagree.

1355
01:23:52.617 --> 01:23:53.780
What's one more?

1356
01:23:53.815 --> 01:23:54.646
- Fuck you!

1357
01:23:59.684 --> 01:24:02.651
- You should have taken
that walk last night.


1358
01:24:02.687 --> 01:24:05.622
I know you thought
about it, but you know,


1359
01:24:05.657 --> 01:24:08.623
you went to him and that
just breaks my heart.


1360
01:24:08.659 --> 01:24:11.696
- You don't have
a heart to break.


1361
01:24:13.268 --> 01:24:15.769
- You're going to
give me a child.


1362
01:24:15.805 --> 01:24:17.271
That's a fact.

1363
01:24:17.307 --> 01:24:21.369
I'd rather do it with
a coddle then a claw.


1364
01:24:21.404 --> 01:24:22.740
I mean originally,

1365
01:24:22.775 --> 01:24:26.275
every single act procreation
in nature was a rape.


1366
01:24:26.310 --> 01:24:28.443
Only humans asked.

1367
01:24:28.478 --> 01:24:30.682
- You ain't touching me.

1368
01:24:32.452 --> 01:24:35.786
- Why is it so valuable
all of a sudden.


1369
01:24:37.053 --> 01:24:39.125
I mean, you've been using
God's reproductive system


1370
01:24:39.160 --> 01:24:41.660
as a tool your entire life.

1371
01:24:41.695 --> 01:24:46.833
I mean, either sex is
meaningless or rape is bad.


1372
01:24:46.869 --> 01:24:47.831
Can't be both.

1373
01:24:55.376 --> 01:24:57.508
- It's the hand
that holds the gift


1374
01:24:57.543 --> 01:25:00.007
that can change
what's in the box,


1375
01:25:00.043 --> 01:25:03.783
and I ain't ever willingly
held it out for free.


1376
01:25:03.819 --> 01:25:04.716
Not once.

1377
01:25:05.888 --> 01:25:06.916
Not for nobody.

1378
01:25:08.451 --> 01:25:09.721
Except Frank.

1379
01:25:12.259 --> 01:25:13.756
You think you's talking over

1380
01:25:13.792 --> 01:25:17.927
a lowly stripper's head
all the time, don't ya?


1381
01:25:19.903 --> 01:25:21.128
Just eats you alive

1382
01:25:21.164 --> 01:25:26.573
that I got a freight train
of love headed only for him,


1383
01:25:27.241 --> 01:25:29.444
and not even you can budge it.

1384
01:25:47.326 --> 01:25:48.925
- I could love you,

1385
01:25:50.130 --> 01:25:51.499
if you let me.

1386
01:25:53.771 --> 01:25:54.799
Think about it.

1387
01:25:57.007 --> 01:25:59.540
I'll see you in the morning.

1388
01:26:02.613 --> 01:26:03.445
- No.

1389
01:26:05.678 --> 01:26:09.715
Somehow in my heart I
know he's coming for me.


1390
01:26:23.697 --> 01:26:27.299
- [Radio Preacher] Who
will be put to shame.


1391
01:26:27.334 --> 01:26:28.802
(speaking in foreign language)

1392
01:26:28.838 --> 01:26:29.999
In Greek,

1393
01:26:30.034 --> 01:26:33.805
you will be humiliated by
this misplaced confidence.


1394
01:26:35.373 --> 01:26:38.513
(Radio chattering)

1395
01:26:41.084 --> 01:26:43.177
So he says in Psalms 5...

1396
01:26:45.823 --> 01:26:48.490
(ominous music)

1397
01:26:55.358 --> 01:26:56.190
- Daddy.

1398
01:26:57.493 --> 01:26:58.933
Dad, daddy.

1399
01:26:58.968 --> 01:27:01.833
(Molly screaming)

1400
01:27:04.037 --> 01:27:04.869
No!

1401
01:27:06.270 --> 01:27:07.973
No!

1402
01:27:08.008 --> 01:27:08.810
Daddy.

1403
01:27:08.846 --> 01:27:11.513
(Molly panting)

1404
01:27:19.582 --> 01:27:22.151
(Molly sobbing)

1405
01:27:22.187 --> 01:27:23.019
No!

1406
01:27:24.224 --> 01:27:26.858
(tense music)

1407
01:27:36.038 --> 01:27:38.705
(intense music)

1408
01:27:51.515 --> 01:27:54.383
(Molly panting)

1409
01:27:54.419 --> 01:27:56.921
(tense music)

1410
01:28:26.484 --> 01:28:29.085
(Molly crying)

1411
01:28:32.588 --> 01:28:33.793
- I'm sorry,

1412
01:28:37.132 --> 01:28:38.292
for all of it.

1413
01:28:45.668 --> 01:28:48.170
(tense music)

1414
01:29:40.592 --> 01:29:42.697
- Stare all you can do?

1415
01:29:44.762 --> 01:29:47.595
- I'm supposed to watch ya.

1416
01:29:47.631 --> 01:29:48.967
Chisos said so.

1417
01:29:49.002 --> 01:29:53.807
- You know staring and
watching aren't the same thing.


1418
01:29:55.039 --> 01:29:58.944
And I feel you staring
something powerful.


1419
01:30:00.147 --> 01:30:00.979
Yeah.

1420
01:30:02.285 --> 01:30:04.983
Powerful like a freight train.

1421
01:30:05.951 --> 01:30:09.691
Do you mind if I call
you Freight Train?


1422
01:30:11.227 --> 01:30:12.219
- Whatever you want,

1423
01:30:12.254 --> 01:30:15.664
I'm just here doing
what I'm supposed to.


1424
01:30:18.634 --> 01:30:21.865
- You know, I felt them
hands on me earlier,


1425
01:30:21.900 --> 01:30:25.273
longer than was
strictly necessary,


1426
01:30:25.308 --> 01:30:27.841
and they felt powerful, too.

1427
01:30:29.672 --> 01:30:30.811
But gentle.

1428
01:30:32.744 --> 01:30:35.178
You a gentle fella deep down?

1429
01:30:36.845 --> 01:30:38.346
- Not with ladies.

1430
01:30:39.750 --> 01:30:41.921
I don't mean to be, but,

1431
01:30:42.822 --> 01:30:45.925
I get excited,
handle 'em too rough.


1432
01:30:48.631 --> 01:30:52.564
Everyone they brought
me, even my wife,


1433
01:30:52.599 --> 01:30:55.029
got a hold of her too hard.

1434
01:30:55.065 --> 01:30:58.231
Now her windpipe
don't work right.


1435
01:30:58.267 --> 01:31:02.073
Shy's away from me
touching her at all now.


1436
01:31:03.176 --> 01:31:07.975
- Well you know, rough ain't
so bad when you're used to it.


1437
01:31:08.010 --> 01:31:10.582
In fact, rough makes some girls

1438
01:31:10.617 --> 01:31:13.117
wetter than the Pontchartrain.

1439
01:31:15.192 --> 01:31:17.088
Can you keep a secret?

1440
01:31:18.921 --> 01:31:21.092
I'm one of them girls,

1441
01:31:22.060 --> 01:31:23.959
and I ain't felt
nothing in them hands


1442
01:31:23.995 --> 01:31:27.098
that I don't find
myself wanting,


1443
01:31:28.668 --> 01:31:31.536
and I think you want it, too.

1444
01:31:31.571 --> 01:31:34.174
Them hands all over me.

1445
01:31:34.210 --> 01:31:37.108
(Magda whimpers)

1446
01:31:42.949 --> 01:31:46.953
I ain't trying to
trick you to get out.


1447
01:31:46.988 --> 01:31:51.188
Hell, you could even come
in here if you wanted to.


1448
01:31:52.329 --> 01:31:54.323
I gotta touch you proper.

1449
01:31:54.359 --> 01:31:57.090
Come on, you can't get me
out like this then deny me.


1450
01:31:57.125 --> 01:31:59.596
- Chisos wouldn't stand for it.

1451
01:31:59.632 --> 01:32:00.761
- Fuck Cheese Sauce.

1452
01:32:00.797 --> 01:32:03.066
(Cookie laughs)

1453
01:32:03.101 --> 01:32:07.006
Besides, I thought we
was keeping secrets.


1454
01:32:09.745 --> 01:32:11.372
You know, it's a secret
that's never told


1455
01:32:11.407 --> 01:32:16.010
that offers the most
extraordinary of suspense.


1456
01:32:16.045 --> 01:32:18.314
And I don't know about you,

1457
01:32:20.049 --> 01:32:23.287
but I ain't gonna tell a soul.

1458
01:32:23.323 --> 01:32:24.292
Shh.

1459
01:32:24.327 --> 01:32:27.356
(light dramatic music)

1460
01:32:41.773 --> 01:32:43.840
- Stick your leg out.

1461
01:32:43.875 --> 01:32:46.012
- Okay, I'll do what you say,

1462
01:32:46.048 --> 01:32:50.981
but then when I get out, you
gotta do what I say, too.


1463
01:32:51.017 --> 01:32:54.515
Teasing makes the
pleasing so much better.


1464
01:32:57.960 --> 01:33:02.127
Once you get that thing
fastened, sit down, okay?


1465
01:33:17.710 --> 01:33:19.375
Go on, sit down now.

1466
01:33:30.188 --> 01:33:32.120
Gonna have to scooch
away from that table


1467
01:33:32.156 --> 01:33:35.363
if you want me to
sit in your lap.


1468
01:33:35.399 --> 01:33:39.098
(light suspenseful music)

1469
01:33:52.079 --> 01:33:56.546
- I need you to know
that I'm a religious man.


1470
01:33:56.581 --> 01:33:57.413
I am.

1471
01:33:59.422 --> 01:34:01.120
I do believe in, in,

1472
01:34:01.156 --> 01:34:05.226
in carrying the weight of
the world by consuming sin.


1473
01:34:05.262 --> 01:34:06.389
I do, I just do.

1474
01:34:07.558 --> 01:34:10.665
(stuttering) even if you people
think we's crazy and all.


1475
01:34:10.700 --> 01:34:12.830
- No, nobody thinks
you're crazy.


1476
01:34:12.865 --> 01:34:13.830
Nobody thinks you're crazy.

1477
01:34:13.865 --> 01:34:16.132
- It's just, I, I, I, I,

1478
01:34:16.167 --> 01:34:18.135
I can't find nothing
wrong ya done.


1479
01:34:18.171 --> 01:34:20.737
- Like I said, nothing's
wrong, nothing's wrong.


1480
01:34:20.773 --> 01:34:21.973
Nobody did nothing.

1481
01:34:22.008 --> 01:34:22.972
- If you'd have
done some sinning.


1482
01:34:23.007 --> 01:34:24.709
- [Frank] Nobody did nothing.

1483
01:34:24.744 --> 01:34:26.447
- I'd a had no issue.

1484
01:34:26.482 --> 01:34:27.744
- Just gotta help me.

1485
01:34:27.780 --> 01:34:28.747
Help me outta here.

1486
01:34:28.783 --> 01:34:32.014
Look, just, just
throw me a rope.


1487
01:34:32.050 --> 01:34:33.079
- No, no, no.
- No, no, no.


1488
01:34:33.115 --> 01:34:34.349
All you gotta do is-

1489
01:34:34.385 --> 01:34:35.523
- No, no, shut your mouth.
- Help us, please.


1490
01:34:35.558 --> 01:34:36.424
- Just shut your fuckin' mouth!

1491
01:34:36.459 --> 01:34:38.524
Shut your fuckin' mouth!

1492
01:34:38.559 --> 01:34:40.258
Just shut it, now!

1493
01:34:43.492 --> 01:34:47.628
I ain't gonna save you
and cross my own people,


1494
01:34:48.604 --> 01:34:50.604
but you can save yourself.

1495
01:34:50.639 --> 01:34:51.872
- What are you talking about?

1496
01:34:51.907 --> 01:34:54.976
(stuttering) What are
you talking about?


1497
01:34:55.012 --> 01:34:57.809
- You gonna have to commit
a sin just like me to do it.


1498
01:34:57.844 --> 01:35:00.311
- What are you talking about?

1499
01:35:04.288 --> 01:35:06.715
(intense music)

1500
01:35:06.751 --> 01:35:07.582
The fuck?

1501
01:35:11.689 --> 01:35:12.920
God!

1502
01:35:12.956 --> 01:35:15.623
(intense music)

1503
01:35:27.337 --> 01:35:32.343
(monitor beeping)
(intense music)


1504
01:35:39.719 --> 01:35:41.154
- No child, no.

1505
01:35:45.287 --> 01:35:49.156
(defibrillator squealing)

1506

(defibrillator shocking)

1507
01:35:50.862 --> 01:35:52.363
Bless you, child.

1508
01:35:54.299 --> 01:35:57.734
I'll tell him you loved
him by dying today.


1509
01:35:57.770 --> 01:36:00.371
(intense music)

(defibrillator shocking)

1512
01:36:18.595 --> 01:36:19.954
You're still out, ain't you?

1513
01:36:19.990 --> 01:36:22.657
(intense music)

1514
01:36:24.161 --> 01:36:26.192
You keep that love alive.

1515
01:36:26.228 --> 01:36:28.469
You hear me, child?

1516
01:36:28.504 --> 01:36:30.203
You hold on tight.

1517
01:36:31.233 --> 01:36:33.572
Don't ever let it go.

1518

(light dramatic music)

1520
01:37:07.069 --> 01:37:08.109
- Scooch.

1521
01:37:17.349 --> 01:37:21.119
- You get in that
corner and turn around.


1522
01:37:21.154 --> 01:37:23.491
This ain't a wifely
thing to watch.


1523

(Magda whimpering)

1524
01:37:33.502 --> 01:37:34.432

Teasin' first, pleasin' second.

1526
01:37:43.809 --> 01:37:44.805
Here you go.

1527
01:37:47.516 --> 01:37:48.347
Just look.

1528
01:37:52.222 --> 01:37:57.356
You never laid eyes on anything
like this before, have you?


1529
01:38:06.197 --> 01:38:08.499
You ready, Freight Train?

1530
01:38:12.441 --> 01:38:13.273
Tell me.

1531
01:38:14.136 --> 01:38:15.875
- I'm ready.

1532
01:38:15.910 --> 01:38:18.509
- No, look at me and tell me.

1533
01:38:20.208 --> 01:38:21.413
- I'm ready.

1534
01:38:25.519 --> 01:38:30.158

I'm sorry about the past.
