00:02:18.086 --> 00:02:22.806
My name's Huck... Huck Finn, and this
story's about me and a slave named Jim.


3
00:02:22.886 --> 00:02:26.727
It's mainly the truth. Oh, sure,
there's a few stretchers here and there,


4
00:02:26.807 --> 00:02:30.527
but I never met anybody who didn't lie
a little when the situation suited him.


5
00:02:30.647 --> 00:02:32.488
So kick off your shoes,
if you're wearin' 'em,


6
00:02:32.568 --> 00:02:35.088
and get ready
for a spit-lickin'good time.


7
00:02:38.128 --> 00:02:40.489
Come on, Finn!

8
00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:42.409
Hit me! Come on!

9
00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:45.129
Come on, Finn!
Come on!


10
00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:49.050
Come on, Finn!
Come on! Let's go!


11
00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:51.530
Hit me! Hit me! Come on!

12
00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:56.331
- Hit me! Afraid of me?
- That all you got?


13
00:03:06.292 --> 00:03:08.612
Come on...

14
00:03:10.932 --> 00:03:13.453
Knock him
into Tuesday, Huck!


15
00:03:13.533 --> 00:03:17.613
- Ahhh! Ahhh!
- Oooh!


16
00:03:20.854 --> 00:03:23.414
Ahhhhhh!

17
00:03:30.015 --> 00:03:33.335
- Go for the glory, Huck!
- Yeah, go for the glory!


18
00:03:33.455 --> 00:03:37.776
Personally I can't see no glory
in punching an ignorant lard ass.


19
00:03:37.856 --> 00:03:41.336
But... I gots to.

20
00:03:52.978 --> 00:03:55.858
- Pap.
- Come on! What're you doin', Huck?


21
00:03:58.298 --> 00:04:01.179
I whooped him!
I whooped him good!


22
00:04:20.221 --> 00:04:24.102
- Hey, Louise! Is Jim home?
- Hello, Huckleberry.


23
00:04:24.222 --> 00:04:26.982
- Hey. Thanks.
- My husband's in the cabin.


24
00:04:27.062 --> 00:04:32.743
Ohhh! I'm startin'to lose
the vision. I'm startin'to lose...


25
00:04:32.863 --> 00:04:35.623
It's goin' and it's goin'!

26
00:04:37.783 --> 00:04:40.984
Ahhh, now it's comin' back.
It's comin' back now.


27
00:04:41.064 --> 00:04:44.904
- Aaah!
- Hey, everybody.


28
00:04:45.024 --> 00:04:47.905
Hey, Sam. Hey, Otis.

29
00:04:49.385 --> 00:04:51.145
Hey, Huck.

30
00:04:51.265 --> 00:04:53.825
- Sorry for bustin' in, Jim.
- That's all right.


31
00:04:53.945 --> 00:04:58.026
- But I need some advice on my futures.
- What kinda advice you need?


32
00:04:58.146 --> 00:05:00.586
Pap's back.

33
00:05:00.706 --> 00:05:05.387
Are you sure? 'Cause he ain't
been seen for more than a year now.


34
00:05:05.507 --> 00:05:08.467
I saw his boot print,
the cross made with nails.


35
00:05:08.587 --> 00:05:11.308
To ward off the devil.
Yeah, that's your pap, all right.


36
00:05:11.428 --> 00:05:14.988
- I need to know what he's gonna do and
how long he's gonna stay. - Now hold on.


37
00:05:15.108 --> 00:05:18.669
I ain't never done this
for no white folks before.


38
00:05:18.789 --> 00:05:21.029
I-I-I don't even know
if it's gonna work.


39
00:05:25.509 --> 00:05:27.710
Give you some marbles.

40
00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:29.910
Maybe it wouldn't hurt to try.

41
00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:32.750
Thanks, Jim.

42
00:05:46.472 --> 00:05:50.793
- What in hell's bells is that?
- Hair ball... from a ox!


43
00:05:50.913 --> 00:05:54.513
Puked it up just the other day.

44
00:05:54.633 --> 00:05:58.193
- That'll tell me my future?
- Shhh!


45
00:05:58.314 --> 00:06:01.834
Spirit lives on the inside of it.

46
00:06:02.994 --> 00:06:05.034
Yeah. Uh-huh.

47
00:06:05.154 --> 00:06:08.115
Uh-huh.
Ya don't say?


48
00:06:08.235 --> 00:06:11.475
No! Not to my good friend
Mr. Finn here!


49
00:06:11.595 --> 00:06:13.995
No!

50
00:06:16.196 --> 00:06:20.436
Your old Pap got two spirits
hoverin' around him.


51
00:06:20.556 --> 00:06:24.597
A sweet one with wings
and a mean one with horns.


52
00:06:24.717 --> 00:06:28.517
Sometime he listen to the good one,
and sometime he listen to the bad one.


53
00:06:28.597 --> 00:06:31.238
The good spirit tell 'im
to leave you alone,


54
00:06:31.318 --> 00:06:34.158
but the bad one tells him
to come and get ya!


55
00:06:36.878 --> 00:06:40.399
Now, the hair ball
don't know...


56
00:06:40.519 --> 00:06:43.119
which spirit gonna be
the most convincin'.


57
00:06:43.239 --> 00:06:46.600
It says that your future...

58
00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:49.800
is driftin' like...

59
00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:51.800
the river.

60
00:07:01.481 --> 00:07:04.602
When your Pap's around...

61
00:07:04.722 --> 00:07:07.722
he always beatin' on you, ain't he?

62
00:07:09.522 --> 00:07:13.323
Yeah...

63
00:07:13.403 --> 00:07:15.683
when he can catch me.

64
00:07:17.724 --> 00:07:20.724
Well, the hair ball thinks that maybe
you ought to skedaddle for a while.


65
00:07:20.884 --> 00:07:23.644
At least until after
your Pap goes away again.


66
00:07:25.645 --> 00:07:29.885
Come tomorrow morning, they'll be
talkin' about me in the past tense.


67
00:07:32.405 --> 00:07:35.166
Jim was owned
by Miss Watson, and about a year ago...


68
00:07:35.286 --> 00:07:38.406
Miss Watson and her sister,
the Widow Douglas, took me in.


69
00:07:38.526 --> 00:07:42.847
They wanted to civilize me, which most
people thought was a right nice idea.


70
00:07:42.967 --> 00:07:47.327
But seein' as how I'm so ignorant
and kinda low-down and ornery...


71
00:07:47.447 --> 00:07:49.327
- Huckleberry!
- You come in here!


72
00:07:49.408 --> 00:07:53.568
- it wasn't workin' out real well.
- You missed dinner.


73
00:07:53.688 --> 00:07:57.088
- You'll go to bed hungry.
- So if ya starve to death by mornin'...


74
00:07:57.208 --> 00:08:00.969
- we'll lay your carcass out for
the birds to eat. - Oh, my land!


75
00:08:01.089 --> 00:08:03.929
- What happened to your eye?
- How'd ya get that shiner?


76
00:08:04.049 --> 00:08:06.690
I saw a blind man
walkin' down the street...


77
00:08:06.810 --> 00:08:10.210
when all of a sudden a gang
of thieves jumped out and grabbed him.


78
00:08:10.330 --> 00:08:13.611
Well, I tried to stop 'em,
but bein' so little and all,


79
00:08:13.731 --> 00:08:16.211
they just walloped me
in the eye and ran off.


80
00:08:16.291 --> 00:08:18.851
That the same gang of thieves who stole
your school books last week?


81
00:08:18.971 --> 00:08:20.731
Yep, same gang.

82
00:08:20.851 --> 00:08:23.892
You told us you whopped 'em so bad
they was never comin' back!


83
00:08:23.972 --> 00:08:27.492
I-I did. But this time
they brung reinforcements.


84
00:08:27.612 --> 00:08:32.293
Hey, where is your fancy school clothes,
Huckleberry! What are these rags?


85
00:08:32.413 --> 00:08:34.853
You played hooky, didn't ya?

86
00:08:34.973 --> 00:08:38.014
No, ma'am.
I went to school.


87
00:08:38.134 --> 00:08:41.694
And on my way home, I ran into a poor
mother with her ten poor children.


88
00:08:41.854 --> 00:08:43.894
Last week that poor mother
only had eight children.


89
00:08:43.974 --> 00:08:46.855
- Well, now she's got two more.
- Uh-huh.


90
00:08:46.935 --> 00:08:50.095
- Anyways, I gave 'em my fancy clothes
to help 'em stay warm. - Hmm!


91
00:08:50.215 --> 00:08:53.256
You sweet child!

92
00:08:53.376 --> 00:08:56.256
I knew we could change him.
I just knew it.


93
00:08:56.376 --> 00:08:59.496
- Why, he's downright chivalrous.
- Why, he's downright nauseous.


94
00:08:59.616 --> 00:09:04.617
And for being so chivalrous, I'm going
to clean you up and dress you up...


95
00:09:04.737 --> 00:09:08.257
and give you something to eat
before evening prayers.


96
00:09:29.260 --> 00:09:31.420
Meow!

97
00:09:35.621 --> 00:09:37.421
Meow.

98
00:09:37.541 --> 00:09:40.822
- Shhh!
- Come on down, Huck.


99
00:09:42.542 --> 00:09:44.742
Aw, hell.

100
00:09:46.222 --> 00:09:47.982
I should've known better.

101
00:09:48.102 --> 00:09:51.783
I should've finished packing and
ran away right then. But no,


102
00:09:51.903 --> 00:09:55.743
I had to go sneak out and play
with my friends one last time.


103
00:09:55.823 --> 00:10:00.944
Little did I know... that that one
mistake was gonna change my life forever.


104
00:10:14.186 --> 00:10:17.666
- Goin' somewhere?
- Maybe I am, and maybe I ain't.


105
00:10:17.746 --> 00:10:21.867
Don't you give me none of your lip!

106
00:10:21.987 --> 00:10:24.507
I don't wanna wake
anybody up just yet.


107
00:10:24.627 --> 00:10:28.748
But you move, and
I'll wail ya good.


108
00:10:28.868 --> 00:10:32.908
Well, looks like you put on considerable
many frills since I've been away.


109
00:10:34.468 --> 00:10:37.109
I hear ya can read and write.

110
00:10:37.229 --> 00:10:40.149
Who told you to meddle in such
highfalutin foolishness anyhow?


111
00:10:40.269 --> 00:10:42.749
The widow told me.

112
00:10:42.869 --> 00:10:45.790
- I'll wail you good for meddlin'
in something like that!


113
00:10:45.910 --> 00:10:48.870
Pretty soon you'll be taking up
religion like your ma did.


114
00:10:48.950 --> 00:10:51.190
Would you leave Ma out of this?
She's dead and you better...


115
00:10:51.310 --> 00:10:54.711
Don't you sass me,
or you'll be joinin' her!


116
00:10:57.231 --> 00:11:00.552
Well, ain't you
the sweet-scented dandy!


117
00:11:00.632 --> 00:11:05.072
With your polished clothes
and your nice bed.


118
00:11:07.152 --> 00:11:10.673
I never seen such a son as you!

119
00:11:12.233 --> 00:11:15.153
Well, I'm not gonna stand for it.

120
00:11:15.273 --> 00:11:18.474
Leave me alone! Let me go!
- You're comin' with me!


121
00:11:18.554 --> 00:11:21.714
- Let me go!
- Oh!


122
00:11:21.874 --> 00:11:25.595
No!

123
00:11:28.595 --> 00:11:32.476
- Let me go! Let me go!
- Pap Finn, you devil in disguise!


124
00:11:32.596 --> 00:11:35.996
Outta my way, you old maid! This here
is what's mine, and I'm takin' it!


125
00:11:36.116 --> 00:11:39.397
- Put that sweet boy down! Ohh!
- Leave them alone! Leave them alone!


126
00:11:39.517 --> 00:11:42.517
Say good-bye, boy,
'cause you ain't never gonna see...


127
00:11:42.637 --> 00:11:44.197
these two old biddies again.

128
00:12:03.480 --> 00:12:06.920
I knew I was in trouble, and
it were only gonna get worse...


129
00:12:07.040 --> 00:12:09.320
once Pap started drinkin'.

130
00:12:12.081 --> 00:12:16.521
I was up the river
with some acquaintances of mine,


131
00:12:16.641 --> 00:12:21.322
and we were doin' some...
jobs, and I got the news.


132
00:12:21.442 --> 00:12:25.682
So when I found out
your ma left you $600,


133
00:12:25.762 --> 00:12:29.243
I figured I'd come and get my due.

134
00:12:29.363 --> 00:12:32.723
I mean, don't I deserve it...

135
00:12:32.803 --> 00:12:37.404
after all the trouble and expense
I went through to raise you proper?


136
00:12:44.725 --> 00:12:47.005
But no.

137
00:12:51.646 --> 00:12:54.114
judge Thatcher says
that money's gotta stay


138
00:12:54.115 --> 00:12:56.806
in the bank 'til you get
yourself to legal age!


139
00:12:56.926 --> 00:13:01.407
Legal age.
I can't be waitin' that long!


140
00:13:06.247 --> 00:13:09.048
What'd I do with that bottle?

141
00:13:14.248 --> 00:13:16.089
But I'm...

142
00:13:27.610 --> 00:13:30.891
I'm your next of kin.

143
00:13:34.891 --> 00:13:37.251
And you're my little angel.

144
00:13:39.292 --> 00:13:42.572
I-I ain't no angel, Pap.
You can ask Miss Watson.


145
00:13:46.213 --> 00:13:48.333
Aaah!

146
00:13:48.453 --> 00:13:53.253
Damn it!

147
00:13:54.814 --> 00:13:58.574
No, Pap! No!

148
00:14:01.934 --> 00:14:04.015
No! No!

149
00:14:04.135 --> 00:14:06.695
No, Pap!

150
00:14:09.135 --> 00:14:11.336
- Yes!
- Pap!


151
00:15:10.823 --> 00:15:13.183
What're you doin' with my gun?

152
00:15:13.303 --> 00:15:16.184
Uh... I thought I heard
somebody tryin' to break in,


153
00:15:16.304 --> 00:15:19.464
- and I was waitin' for 'em, Pap!
- Well, why didn't ya rouse me?


154
00:15:19.544 --> 00:15:21.945
I tried, but I couldn't.

155
00:15:22.025 --> 00:15:24.665
Hey, what're you
doin' here anyway?


156
00:15:24.785 --> 00:15:27.465
You brought me here, Pap.

157
00:15:27.545 --> 00:15:29.546
Did I? Why?

158
00:15:29.626 --> 00:15:34.226
- 'Cause you said you missed me so.
- Don't you lie to me.


159
00:15:34.346 --> 00:15:37.347
That couldn't be the reason.

160
00:15:37.467 --> 00:15:42.187
Oh, yeah, that money your ma left you.
Damned Judge Thatcher!


161
00:15:42.267 --> 00:15:46.868
Have to think of another way.
Look at this place.


162
00:15:48.628 --> 00:15:51.948
- What'd you do to my house?
- I didn't do anything, Pap.


163
00:15:55.549 --> 00:16:00.389
I'm goin' to town.
You clean up around here.


164
00:16:00.509 --> 00:16:02.550
Yes, Pap.

165
00:16:02.670 --> 00:16:05.870
Mmmm. "Yes, Pap."

166
00:16:05.950 --> 00:16:09.071
Little runt.

167
00:16:21.552 --> 00:16:25.193
I knew if I
stuck around I'd be dead.

168
00:16:25.313 --> 00:16:29.273
But dead was the only way
Pap would ever leave me alone.


169
00:16:36.194 --> 00:16:40.915
Wild boars are mighty good eatin'. And
this one were gonna save my life as well.


170
00:17:43.202 --> 00:17:45.443
What the...

171
00:17:58.724 --> 00:18:01.325
Now that I was dead,
I could do what I wanted...


172
00:18:01.445 --> 00:18:06.045
and go where I wanted, and neither Pap nor
Miss Watson would ever try and follow me.


173
00:18:06.125 --> 00:18:08.526
And right now, I figured
I'd go to Jackson's Island.


174
00:18:08.646 --> 00:18:11.086
No one lives there
nor hardly visits,


175
00:18:11.206 --> 00:18:13.446
and the fishin's
awful good too.


176
00:18:55.892 --> 00:18:59.412
- Aaah!
- Aaah!


177
00:18:59.532 --> 00:19:03.813
- Huck? - Hell's bells, Jim! I
almost puked up my livers.


178
00:19:03.893 --> 00:19:05.933
- I thought you was dead.
- I ain't dead.


179
00:19:06.053 --> 00:19:08.013
But your Pap came into town
this mornin'...


180
00:19:08.133 --> 00:19:10.853
screamin' about how some robbers
had cut you into a million pieces.


181
00:19:10.933 --> 00:19:14.734
Faked it all, Jim.
I'm as alive as you.


182
00:19:17.614 --> 00:19:21.095
- Nope. You ain't dead.
- Funny, Jim!


183
00:19:23.255 --> 00:19:26.975
- Your Pap look like he done seen the
devil himself. - Scared him, did I?


184
00:19:27.095 --> 00:19:29.271
Scared him? You scared
the whole town. They's


185
00:19:29.272 --> 00:19:31.256
out huntin' down your
murderer right now.


186
00:19:31.376 --> 00:19:34.776
- That's mighty nice of 'em. - The widow
wants you to have a proper burial,


187
00:19:34.896 --> 00:19:39.577
so she got all the womenfolk fleecin'
the woods lookin' for your carcass.


188
00:19:39.697 --> 00:19:44.378
- Wish 'em luck, Jim. They ain't gonna
find my remainders. - No, they're not.


189
00:19:44.498 --> 00:19:47.818
You know,
I kinda like bein' dead.


190
00:19:47.978 --> 00:19:49.778
Come on!

191
00:19:54.419 --> 00:19:56.219
Whoo!

192
00:19:56.339 --> 00:19:59.380
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

193
00:20:02.420 --> 00:20:07.261
Say, Jim! Shouldn't ya be gettin'
back before Miss Watson misses ya?


194
00:20:07.381 --> 00:20:11.141
Well, Huck...

195
00:20:11.261 --> 00:20:13.941
You promise not to tell on me
if I tell you somethin'?


196
00:20:14.061 --> 00:20:17.022
Damned if I would, Jim.

197
00:20:17.142 --> 00:20:19.822
Honest Injun.

198
00:20:19.902 --> 00:20:23.663
Well, I believe you,
so I'm gonna tell you.


199
00:20:23.743 --> 00:20:28.103
This mornin' in all the confusion
caused by your murder...


200
00:20:28.223 --> 00:20:30.583
- I ran off!
-Jim!


201
00:20:30.704 --> 00:20:33.344
- You promised not to tell!
- I know I did! I know.


202
00:20:33.464 --> 00:20:35.744
And my word's my word,
and I'll keep my word.


203
00:20:35.864 --> 00:20:38.865
But Jim...
you're a runaway slave!


204
00:20:38.945 --> 00:20:42.785
I could get tarred
for not turnin' you in.


205
00:20:42.905 --> 00:20:45.345
I could get lynched.

206
00:20:45.465 --> 00:20:48.386
Why'd ya do it, Jim?

207
00:20:48.506 --> 00:20:51.986
A slave trader come by the other day
and offered Miss Watson $800 for me.


208
00:20:52.066 --> 00:20:54.787
Her and the widow felt
so bad they pert near cried.


209
00:20:54.907 --> 00:20:57.587
But times is tough. It was
just too much money to resist.


210
00:20:57.667 --> 00:21:00.347
I couldn't let myself get sold
all the way down New Orleans.


211
00:21:00.467 --> 00:21:03.668
- I'd never see my wife and
my children again! - But Jim!


212
00:21:03.748 --> 00:21:07.428
Now ya ain't never
gonna get to see 'em.


213
00:21:07.548 --> 00:21:10.148
My only chance is
to go downriver to Cairo.


214
00:21:10.268 --> 00:21:14.789
- Go south? A runaway slave go south?
- I know, I know!


215
00:21:14.909 --> 00:21:18.069
But I got me a canoe,
Huck, and this.


216
00:21:18.149 --> 00:21:22.070
A map to freedom.
Now, here's me.


217
00:21:22.150 --> 00:21:25.710
If I can get myself
all the way down here to Cairo,


218
00:21:25.830 --> 00:21:28.391
where the Ohio River
comes into the Mississippi,


219
00:21:28.511 --> 00:21:32.071
I can take it all the way
up to the free states.


220
00:21:32.191 --> 00:21:36.552
You know how hard that'd be, Jim?
It's a million miles to Cairo!


221
00:21:36.672 --> 00:21:40.392
And a slave
on the river by himself?


222
00:21:40.512 --> 00:21:43.273
- Ya won't get five miles.
- I know.


223
00:21:43.393 --> 00:21:45.993
But if I could do it,
if I could...


224
00:21:46.113 --> 00:21:50.234
I'd get the chance to earn
money to buy my family.


225
00:21:54.594 --> 00:21:57.154
Ah, hell!

226
00:22:02.875 --> 00:22:05.115
We'll do it together.

227
00:22:05.195 --> 00:22:08.436
I'll help you get to Cairo.

228
00:22:12.156 --> 00:22:14.757
Aw, shut up, Jim!

229
00:22:15.077 --> 00:22:19.117
- Now, don't be long, and don't forget
the eggs. - All right. All right.


230
00:22:19.197 --> 00:22:21.037
- And the flour.
- All right.


231
00:22:21.117 --> 00:22:22.998
And the candles,
matches, tobacco...


232
00:22:23.118 --> 00:22:26.638
Hell's bells, Jim! Whatever ain't
nailed down is what I'll get!


233
00:22:26.758 --> 00:22:29.118
And don't let nobody
recognize you.


234
00:22:35.399 --> 00:22:38.440
- Well, hello, ma'am.
- Hello, child. My lands!


235
00:22:38.560 --> 00:22:41.040
- What happened to your eye?
- A cow kicked me.


236
00:22:41.160 --> 00:22:43.240
Gracious! Well,
what can I do for you?


237
00:22:43.360 --> 00:22:45.921
Well, I was comin' from
Hookville to visit my cousin...


238
00:22:46.001 --> 00:22:50.841
- when my horse went lame.
- Oh, dear me! Well, come in, come in.


239
00:22:50.961 --> 00:22:53.682
My, that's a pretty bonnet!

240
00:22:53.802 --> 00:22:57.042
- A little girl across the lane has one
just like it. - It's a popular style.


241
00:22:57.162 --> 00:23:00.722
Well, it looks so much cuter on you.
So, what's your name?


242
00:23:00.842 --> 00:23:03.283
Sarah.
Sarah Williams.


243
00:23:03.403 --> 00:23:05.803
Well, she got
to talking about this and about that...


244
00:23:05.963 --> 00:23:08.723
and blah-di-blah-di-blah until I wanted
to wring her scrawny little neck.


245
00:23:08.843 --> 00:23:11.844
So I decided to take advantage
of the situation.


246
00:23:11.924 --> 00:23:14.644
But by and by, she got to
talking about the murder.


247
00:23:14.764 --> 00:23:16.724
That's where
my husband is right now,


248
00:23:16.844 --> 00:23:19.405
out with some of the other men
trying to hunt up the murderer.


249
00:23:19.525 --> 00:23:21.485
And when they find him,
they's gonna shoot him.


250
00:23:21.605 --> 00:23:25.045
That's good! 'Cause I heard
Huck Finn was such a sweet boy.


251
00:23:25.166 --> 00:23:27.486
That ain't what I heard.

252
00:23:28.846 --> 00:23:31.606
So who do they think
killed him?


253
00:23:31.726 --> 00:23:34.807
At first, everyone figured that
old Pap Finn done it himself.


254
00:23:34.927 --> 00:23:37.207
- Is that so?
- They almost lynched him, too.


255
00:23:37.327 --> 00:23:40.647
But then he up and vanished with
some of his rapscallion friends.


256
00:23:40.727 --> 00:23:43.001
It ain't no matter.
'Cause now everyone judges


257
00:23:43.002 --> 00:23:45.128
that the man who
murdered poor Huck Finn...


258
00:23:45.208 --> 00:23:47.288
were a runaway slave named Jim.

259
00:23:47.408 --> 00:23:49.969
Jim!

260
00:23:50.089 --> 00:23:51.529
Jim?

261
00:23:51.609 --> 00:23:54.289
Missus, where's my jacket?

262
00:23:54.409 --> 00:23:56.449
- Howdy, little one.
- Hello, good sir.


263
00:23:56.569 --> 00:23:59.610
- What're you fetchin' off for? - I think
we found that murderin' runaway slave.


264
00:23:59.730 --> 00:24:02.370
- Huh! - Now, we been lookin' everywhere,
and some old codger just now...


265
00:24:02.490 --> 00:24:05.371
said that he saw smoke
out on Jackson Island.


266
00:24:05.491 --> 00:24:09.131
Ain't nobody lives there and hardly
anyone visits, so it's gotta be him!


267
00:24:09.211 --> 00:24:11.131
Hey, hey!

268
00:24:11.211 --> 00:24:14.492
- Now, you watch yourself there, little
precious. - You be careful!


269
00:24:14.612 --> 00:24:20.132
Oh, don't worry, I will. That slave
is worth $400, dead or alive.


270
00:24:22.173 --> 00:24:24.013
I best be goin' now.

271
00:24:24.093 --> 00:24:27.373
Oh, not until
you've had some vittles.


272
00:24:27.453 --> 00:24:30.814
- What was your name again?
- Mary... Williams.


273
00:24:30.934 --> 00:24:33.454
I thought you said it was Sarah.

274
00:24:33.534 --> 00:24:36.294
Yessim, I did.
Sarah Mary Williams.


275
00:24:36.414 --> 00:24:38.815
Somes calls me Sarah;
somes calls me Mary.


276
00:24:41.335 --> 00:24:43.135
My goodness!

277
00:24:43.255 --> 00:24:48.536
- You think you could hit that rat for me?
- Be happy to.


278
00:24:54.337 --> 00:24:58.017
- Got 'im!
- Good arm you got there.


279
00:24:58.137 --> 00:25:01.818
Ohhh, I keep it in shape
with lots of knittin'.


280
00:25:01.978 --> 00:25:05.218
- You is a boy!
- Oh, how you do tease a poor girl so.


281
00:25:05.338 --> 00:25:07.138
You may fool some, but not me!

282
00:25:07.258 --> 00:25:09.579
If you was a girl, you'd have missed
that rat by six or seven feet.


283
00:25:09.699 --> 00:25:11.779
Now fess up!
Who is ya?


284
00:25:11.899 --> 00:25:16.780
You fess up, you little thing! You tell
me, who is ya? You tell me, who is ya?


285
00:25:16.900 --> 00:25:18.940
Oh! Oh!

286
00:25:19.060 --> 00:25:21.460
Come back here!

287
00:25:21.540 --> 00:25:24.541
-Jim! Jim, wake up! Wake up!
- Huh?


288
00:25:27.621 --> 00:25:29.821
- Oh, man! - Look at you, Huck.
If you ain't the prettiest...


289
00:25:29.941 --> 00:25:32.982
They's after us, Jim, and there ain't
a minute to lose. Come on!


290
00:25:37.062 --> 00:25:40.543
- Come on.
- Hurry up!


291
00:25:40.663 --> 00:25:45.183
- Come on, come on! Them dogs sound hungry!
- Then get a move on.


292
00:25:51.944 --> 00:25:54.584
Hey!

293
00:25:54.664 --> 00:25:57.665
We was off,
headin' down the mighty Mississippi...


294
00:25:57.785 --> 00:26:01.385
on the journey to Cairo
to set Jim free.


295
00:26:01.505 --> 00:26:04.946
'Course, first we had to stop
along the way and borrow a few things.


296
00:26:05.066 --> 00:26:08.306
Say, Huck,
I been feelin'...


297
00:26:08.426 --> 00:26:11.707
mighty guiltful 'bout all this
borrowin' we've been doin'.


298
00:26:11.787 --> 00:26:13.707
- Ah, you'll get over it.
- That ain't the point.


299
00:26:17.027 --> 00:26:19.387
That ain't who
I think it is, is it?


300
00:26:20.748 --> 00:26:24.748
It's you, all right, Jim.

301
00:26:24.868 --> 00:26:28.549
" Four hundred dollar reward.

302
00:26:28.669 --> 00:26:31.229
- Runaway slave."
- And what's that say?


303
00:26:31.309 --> 00:26:35.109
Uh... handsome
and well-mannered.


304
00:26:35.229 --> 00:26:38.670
Oh... Now come on, Huck,
what's it really say?


305
00:26:38.790 --> 00:26:42.830
Nothin'.
Just that you're wanted for murder.


306
00:26:42.950 --> 00:26:46.631
Murder! I...

307
00:26:46.751 --> 00:26:49.471
Ohhh, I see.

308
00:26:49.551 --> 00:26:51.872
I'm wanted for your murder.

309
00:26:51.952 --> 00:26:55.512
Well, we best travel only at night.

310
00:26:58.512 --> 00:27:01.073
Is that what I really look like?

311
00:27:01.193 --> 00:27:04.713
- 'Fraid so, Jim.
- Damn!


312
00:27:21.635 --> 00:27:25.556
- Oh, did you see that?
- Let's go for it!


313
00:27:25.676 --> 00:27:28.316
- What if there's people on it?
- No way!


314
00:27:28.436 --> 00:27:32.277
A body'd have to be crazy to be on that
wreck! She's bound to break up any second.


315
00:27:32.397 --> 00:27:35.717
Oh, fine! Then let's
just get right aboard!


316
00:27:51.639 --> 00:27:53.999
Looks like she ain't
been here long.


317
00:27:54.119 --> 00:27:57.840
Yeah. Might be some good loot around.
Let's split up and see what she's got.


318
00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:02.200
Hold on, hold on! Dead bodies is
what she's got, so let's be careful.


319
00:28:02.320 --> 00:28:04.081
Right!

320
00:28:06.641 --> 00:28:09.241
- I'll go this way.
- I'll go below.


321
00:28:09.361 --> 00:28:11.442
- Oh!
- Oh!


322
00:28:24.283 --> 00:28:28.284
Please don't kill me, boys.
Please don't kill me!


323
00:28:28.404 --> 00:28:32.604
You're a lyin' thief, Joe Turner, and now
you're gonna pay for it with your life!


324
00:28:32.724 --> 00:28:35.805
Wait, listen! You can keep my share,
I won't tell nobody!


325
00:28:35.925 --> 00:28:38.565
It's too late for that now!

326
00:28:38.685 --> 00:28:40.885
Ohh! Ohh!

327
00:28:47.446 --> 00:28:49.846
This thing's sinkin'
quicker than we figured!


328
00:28:50.006 --> 00:28:52.367
Yeah, let's get the booty
and get outta here!


329
00:28:52.447 --> 00:28:55.487
- You can't just leave me here. You can't
leave me! - You killed your own partner.


330
00:28:55.607 --> 00:28:58.127
He deserved the bullet
I gave him!


331
00:28:58.208 --> 00:29:00.248
Uhhh!

332
00:29:11.489 --> 00:29:13.449
Aaah!

333
00:29:27.171 --> 00:29:30.412
Damn! One more like that
and she's had it!


334
00:29:30.532 --> 00:29:33.852
You can't just leave me here, boys.
You can't just leave me!


335
00:29:33.972 --> 00:29:36.372
- Ah, shut up!
- Uhh!


336
00:29:36.452 --> 00:29:39.813
- Hey, get over here!
- Aaah!


337
00:29:39.933 --> 00:29:42.173
- Who are you?
- Nobody.


338
00:29:42.293 --> 00:29:45.693
- What're you doin' here?
- Nothin'.


339
00:29:50.974 --> 00:29:53.214
Grab the silver!

340
00:29:57.655 --> 00:29:59.855
Oh, my God!
We're goin' down!


341
00:30:02.856 --> 00:30:05.256
Aaah!

342
00:30:10.817 --> 00:30:14.337
- We best be goin',Jim! There's pirates
on board! - I know, I know!


343
00:30:18.378 --> 00:30:20.898
The canoe!

344
00:30:21.018 --> 00:30:23.298
Damn!

345
00:30:23.418 --> 00:30:27.779
- They must have a boat on the other
side! Come on! - Let's get it!


346
00:30:27.899 --> 00:30:29.739
There it is!

347
00:30:29.859 --> 00:30:32.419
Move it, move it!

348
00:30:48.581 --> 00:30:52.102
- Come on! Help me, Jim!
- I'm comin', I'm comin'!


349
00:31:30.067 --> 00:31:33.147
I feel sort of bad for them
murderers dyin' like that.


350
00:31:33.267 --> 00:31:36.147
I might end up bein'
murderer myself someday,


351
00:31:36.267 --> 00:31:39.948
and how would I like it,
drownin' on some barge?


352
00:31:40.068 --> 00:31:43.308
- Huck?
- Yeah, Jim.


353
00:31:43.428 --> 00:31:47.189
If you was to hear that your Pap wasn't
ever gonna return to St. Petersburg,


354
00:31:47.309 --> 00:31:49.862
like, if he up and
died or some such, would


355
00:31:49.863 --> 00:31:52.589
you still help me to
get to Cairo and be free?


356
00:31:52.710 --> 00:31:55.190
Or would you go on back home?

357
00:31:55.310 --> 00:31:59.070
I'd go back, most likely, just to see
the look on people's faces.


358
00:31:59.190 --> 00:32:02.991
We'd both go back, Jim,
bein' the right thing and all.


359
00:32:03.111 --> 00:32:06.671
Yeah. Sure, bein'
the right thing and all.


360
00:32:06.791 --> 00:32:09.872
Don't you worry. I'll make sure
Miss Watson takes you back.


361
00:32:18.553 --> 00:32:22.473
Smell that, Huck?
Smells like freedom.


362
00:32:22.553 --> 00:32:27.154
If that's Cairo,
I'm a free man!


363
00:32:27.274 --> 00:32:30.074
And when I'm free,
I'm gonna work hard...


364
00:32:30.194 --> 00:32:34.115
and save every penny and buy
my wife and my children.


365
00:32:34.235 --> 00:32:37.115
And if they won't sell 'em,
I'll steal 'em!


366
00:32:37.235 --> 00:32:39.875
You wouldn't.

367
00:32:39.995 --> 00:32:43.196
Only if they won't
sell 'em, Huck.


368
00:32:43.316 --> 00:32:47.636
They're my wife and my children. It
ain't right that they be bought and sold.


369
00:32:47.756 --> 00:32:50.477
Someone gonna do it.
Ought to be me.


370
00:32:50.557 --> 00:32:54.037
Listen to yourself.
Ya hear what you're sayin'?


371
00:32:54.157 --> 00:32:59.758
Sellin' people and usin' 'em
for slaves ain't right, Huck.


372
00:32:59.838 --> 00:33:03.718
- Somehow... - That's the way it is,
and that's the way it's always been.


373
00:33:03.838 --> 00:33:06.839
But it ain't right, Huck.

374
00:33:06.959 --> 00:33:09.879
Don't ya see that to be true?

375
00:33:10.039 --> 00:33:14.400
Slavery ain't right.
All men should be free.


376
00:33:14.520 --> 00:33:18.480
I've never heard
such talk in my life.


377
00:33:22.041 --> 00:33:24.761
Right then I knew
what I was doin' was wicked.


378
00:33:24.881 --> 00:33:28.002
And I could feel the hand of God
about to take a swing at me.


379
00:33:28.122 --> 00:33:32.642
Then suddenly I knew what I had to do.
I had to turn Jim in.


380
00:33:32.762 --> 00:33:34.802
Say, uh...Jim?

381
00:33:34.882 --> 00:33:39.083
- Yeah, Huck.
- All these towns lookin' the same,


382
00:33:39.203 --> 00:33:42.443
how're we gonna know
which one's Cairo?


383
00:33:42.563 --> 00:33:45.724
- We'll see the Ohio River comin' in,
won't we? - We might miss it.


384
00:33:45.844 --> 00:33:51.204
I'll tell you what. Next time we
see someone I'll grab a log,


385
00:33:51.324 --> 00:33:55.685
- paddle ashore and ask 'em. - Don't worry,
Huck. We'll see the Ohio River comin' in.


386
00:33:55.805 --> 00:33:58.405
But we might miss it!

387
00:33:58.525 --> 00:34:01.566
Best make sure.

388
00:34:03.126 --> 00:34:04.926
Yeah.

389
00:34:07.366 --> 00:34:09.207
Sure, Huck.

390
00:34:12.807 --> 00:34:15.688
- Find anything, boys?
-Nothin' over here!


391
00:34:15.808 --> 00:34:18.968
I know we're close, Huck.
We're safe!


392
00:34:19.048 --> 00:34:21.128
You really don't have to do this!

393
00:34:21.248 --> 00:34:23.649
Cairo could be anywhere.

394
00:34:25.449 --> 00:34:28.169
I'll be right back.

395
00:34:28.289 --> 00:34:32.810
I'd come mighty close to helpin' set Jim
free and goin' to hell for it.


396
00:34:32.930 --> 00:34:35.050
But now I was gonna
do what's right,


397
00:34:35.170 --> 00:34:38.330
and I was startin'
to feel real good.


398
00:34:43.051 --> 00:34:48.172
There he goes...
true blue Huck Finn.


399
00:34:48.292 --> 00:34:52.332
The only white gentleman ever kept
his promise to old Jim.


400
00:34:52.452 --> 00:34:54.892
Huck Finn, a man of his word.

401
00:34:55.013 --> 00:34:59.053
A man who sticks by his friends
come hell or high water.


402
00:34:59.173 --> 00:35:02.733
I'm mighty proud to know him.

403
00:35:02.853 --> 00:35:05.094
Ah, shut up, Jim.

404
00:35:11.775 --> 00:35:14.535
Never forget ya, Huck.

405
00:35:18.375 --> 00:35:21.096
Best friend I ever had.

406
00:35:33.737 --> 00:35:37.778
I felt just sick,
but I says to myself,


407
00:35:37.898 --> 00:35:43.019
"Self, you's got to tell on 'im.
It's the only right thing to do. "


408
00:35:43.139 --> 00:35:47.379
- You boy! That a raft out there yonder?
- Yes, sir, it is.


409
00:35:47.459 --> 00:35:49.779
- Is it yours?
- Yes, sir.


410
00:35:49.899 --> 00:35:52.100
Any men on it?

411
00:35:52.180 --> 00:35:54.100
just one, sir.

412
00:35:55.940 --> 00:35:59.381
We're lookin' for five slaves
that ran away last night.


413
00:35:59.501 --> 00:36:02.661
The man on the raft,
is he white or black?


414
00:36:07.342 --> 00:36:10.262
He's white.

415
00:36:10.382 --> 00:36:14.343
And maybe you're one of them abolitionist
boys that likes to help runaway slaves?


416
00:36:14.423 --> 00:36:17.783
- I believe we'd better look for ourselves.
- Oh, I wish you would.


417
00:36:17.903 --> 00:36:19.856
'Cause it's my Pap out
there, and he's awful


418
00:36:19.857 --> 00:36:21.983
sick. And so is my mom,
my sister, my brother...


419
00:36:22.103 --> 00:36:24.104
You said there was
one man on that raft.


420
00:36:24.184 --> 00:36:27.544
I saw your guns and just
got scared, I guess.


421
00:36:27.664 --> 00:36:30.745
Need a tow over,
if ya don't mind.


422
00:36:30.865 --> 00:36:32.865
We do mind, boy.
We're in a hurry.


423
00:36:34.705 --> 00:36:37.625
- Oh, come on, get on board.
- Thank ya.


424
00:36:37.745 --> 00:36:41.026
People usually just run away when I tell
'em my whole family is sick as dogs.


425
00:36:41.146 --> 00:36:42.986
- What's wrong with 'em?
- Well...


426
00:36:43.066 --> 00:36:46.827
my sister's pukin' everywhere,
my ma's smellin' real bad,


427
00:36:46.907 --> 00:36:50.707
- my brother's skin's kinda rottin'
off his body. - Oh!


428
00:36:50.827 --> 00:36:52.787
Pa... Oh,
it's disgusting!


429
00:36:52.907 --> 00:36:55.668
Your whole family's got the pox, boy!
You wanna spread it around?


430
00:36:55.788 --> 00:36:57.628
But I've asked everybody,
and nobody'll help me.


431
00:36:57.748 --> 00:37:00.828
Downstream about 20 miles is
another town. You go ask them!


432
00:37:00.948 --> 00:37:03.149
- Would that be Cairo? - No, Cairo
ain't for another hundred miles.


433
00:37:03.229 --> 00:37:05.429
Listen, boy!

434
00:37:05.549 --> 00:37:09.309
Next time, don't tell people what ya got.
Just lie your little face off. Now, get!


435
00:37:09.429 --> 00:37:12.630
Uhhh! I can't believe
you're not gonna help us.


436
00:37:12.750 --> 00:37:15.710
The smell on that raft's
just killin' me.


437
00:37:15.830 --> 00:37:18.084
You see any runaway
slaves, boy, you get some


438
00:37:18.085 --> 00:37:20.191
help and nab 'em. You
can make some money.


439
00:37:20.311 --> 00:37:23.511
You bet, sir. I won't let
no runaway slaves get by me.


440
00:37:27.792 --> 00:37:30.512
True blue Huck Finn.

441
00:37:30.592 --> 00:37:35.073
It's always so damn troublesome
doin' right and so damn easy doin' wrong.


442
00:37:35.193 --> 00:37:39.393
But I decided from now on, I'm just
gonna do whatever come handiest.


443
00:37:55.075 --> 00:37:58.356
- You mean French people don't talk
the same as us? - Why, no, Jim.


444
00:37:58.436 --> 00:38:01.316
You couldn't understand
a single word they said.


445
00:38:01.436 --> 00:38:04.476
- Oh, I suppose you could.
- You suppose right.


446
00:38:04.596 --> 00:38:06.957
I was taught some of
their jabber out of books.


447
00:38:07.077 --> 00:38:10.757
- Oooh, you know some of their jabber, huh?
- Yeah, I do.


448
00:38:10.877 --> 00:38:14.918
What would you think if a man came up
to you and said, " Pallee-voo Franzee?"


449
00:38:15.038 --> 00:38:19.278
- I wouldn't think nothin'.
I'd just bust him over the head.


450
00:38:19.398 --> 00:38:22.719
He ain't sayin' nothin' bad!
He just asked you if you talk French.


451
00:38:22.839 --> 00:38:26.359
- Well, why didn't he just say it?
- He did just say it.


452
00:38:26.439 --> 00:38:29.160
No, he didn't!
He said, " Pallee-voo Francine!"


453
00:38:29.280 --> 00:38:31.038
Well, that's a Frenchman's way
of askin' if you talk French.


454
00:38:31.039 --> 00:38:31.960
It's a stupid way of askin' it!

455
00:38:32.040 --> 00:38:34.640
- It ain't stupid!
- Well, it is! It's ridiculous!


456
00:38:34.760 --> 00:38:37.441
- It ain't ridiculous.
We just talk different.


457
00:38:39.881 --> 00:38:43.721
- Lookit here, Jim! Does a cat talk like
we do? - No, a cat don't.


458
00:38:43.841 --> 00:38:45.802
- Does a cow?
- No, a cow don't neither.


459
00:38:45.922 --> 00:38:47.922
Does a cat talk like a cow
or a cow like a cat?


460
00:38:48.042 --> 00:38:51.562
All right, all right. No, they don't.
They talk different.


461
00:38:51.682 --> 00:38:55.363
Right! And French people talk
different than us! Ya see?


462
00:38:55.483 --> 00:38:58.923
I rest my case!

463
00:38:59.043 --> 00:39:00.803
All right, Mr. Finn.

464
00:39:03.204 --> 00:39:05.924
- Is a cow a cat?
- No.


465
00:39:08.284 --> 00:39:10.885
- Is a cat a cow?
- No.


466
00:39:12.045 --> 00:39:15.085
- Is a cow a man?
- No, Jim.


467
00:39:15.205 --> 00:39:17.726
- Is a cat a man?
- No.


468
00:39:19.966 --> 00:39:22.446
- Is a Frenchman a man?
- Yeah.


469
00:39:22.566 --> 00:39:25.127
Then we don't he
talk like a man?


470
00:39:25.247 --> 00:39:27.167
Poke.

471
00:39:28.967 --> 00:39:31.847
You see?
I rest my case.


472
00:39:33.768 --> 00:39:37.088
You know... you've got
a point there, Jim.


473
00:39:40.488 --> 00:39:42.969
And the point is...

474
00:39:43.089 --> 00:39:46.009
just because you're taught
somethin's right,


475
00:39:46.129 --> 00:39:49.810
and everybody believes
it's right,


476
00:39:49.930 --> 00:39:51.970
it don't make it right.

477
00:39:52.050 --> 00:39:54.810
You get my meaning?

478
00:39:56.851 --> 00:40:00.891
Yeah, I do.

479
00:40:06.212 --> 00:40:08.292
-Jim! Let's get!
- Huh!


480
00:40:08.372 --> 00:40:11.092
Jump, Huck! Jump!

481
00:40:11.212 --> 00:40:13.413
-Jump!
- Aaah!


482
00:40:44.537 --> 00:40:47.977
-Jim! Jim!
- Jim! Jim!


483
00:40:49.497 --> 00:40:51.537
-Jim!
-Jim!


484
00:40:55.058 --> 00:40:57.178
Jim.

485
00:41:04.179 --> 00:41:07.379
Make a move, and I'll
blast you in half!


486
00:41:09.460 --> 00:41:13.460
That's far enough now.
See if there's anybody else out there.


487
00:41:17.421 --> 00:41:20.381
Why, Pa!
He's no Shepherdson!


488
00:41:20.501 --> 00:41:23.221
- Hush, Sophie.
- No, he isn't. Put those guns down!


489
00:41:23.341 --> 00:41:26.902
There's nothin' Shepherdson
about him at all.


490
00:41:27.022 --> 00:41:29.102
- Look at that face.
- Well, then, what is your name, son?


491
00:41:29.182 --> 00:41:31.663
I-I-It's
George Jackson, sir.


492
00:41:31.743 --> 00:41:34.343
- You see! - Put your hand
down. - Hey, what's goin' on?


493
00:41:34.463 --> 00:41:38.143
- Here, let me dry you off.
- Ain't there no Shepherdsons around?


494
00:41:38.263 --> 00:41:40.944
You know, we might've been shot,
you bein' so slow in comin', Billy.


495
00:41:41.024 --> 00:41:43.984
Where did you come from, George?

496
00:41:44.064 --> 00:41:46.464
I fell off a steamboat, sir.

497
00:41:46.584 --> 00:41:49.785
- Whoa, fell off a steamboat!
- Oh, you poor boy! Falls off a steamboat,


498
00:41:49.905 --> 00:41:52.665
and then you go and
scare him to death!


499
00:41:52.785 --> 00:41:56.066
They was real nice
once they decided not to kill me.


500
00:41:56.186 --> 00:42:00.146
They told me they was the Grangerfords,
and asked me a million questions.


501
00:42:00.226 --> 00:42:04.347
I decided it'd be best to leave out
the truth, so I slung 'em a story.


502
00:42:04.467 --> 00:42:07.467
And after my pa got killed
in that stampede,


503
00:42:07.587 --> 00:42:10.907
my ma ran off
with a circus clown.


504
00:42:11.027 --> 00:42:13.148
Never saw her again.

505
00:42:13.268 --> 00:42:16.628
- Well, you can stay here with us.
- As long as you like.


506
00:42:16.708 --> 00:42:19.068
Thanks.

507
00:42:33.350 --> 00:42:37.111
You see what I'm talkin' about?

508
00:42:39.111 --> 00:42:43.192
Hey, George! Here's
a present for bein' my new friend.


509
00:42:45.352 --> 00:42:49.552
This is the nicest thing
anybody's ever given me.


510
00:42:49.672 --> 00:42:52.153
- Thanks, Billy.
- Billy!


511
00:42:52.233 --> 00:42:54.673
Everything's been real quiet between
the Shepherdsons and us lately,


512
00:42:54.793 --> 00:42:56.793
so don't you go
stirring things up.


513
00:42:56.873 --> 00:43:00.394
Oh, Sophie, leave me alone.
Come on, George.


514
00:43:00.514 --> 00:43:02.794
Say, Billy, let's
slide on down to the river.


515
00:43:02.914 --> 00:43:06.154
I wanna see if any of my...
belongings washed up on shore.


516
00:43:06.274 --> 00:43:08.515
Well, first we gotta
take care of something.


517
00:43:08.635 --> 00:43:11.075
Seems a lot of things have been
washing up lately.


518
00:43:22.396 --> 00:43:25.317
A steamer hit his raft last night
and killed his master.


519
00:43:25.437 --> 00:43:27.757
So he's ours.
We had to chain him.


520
00:43:27.877 --> 00:43:31.478
Hey! Get up!
Come on, get up!


521
00:43:31.598 --> 00:43:35.438
Looks a little rough. Me and you
gotta break him in a little bit.


522
00:43:35.558 --> 00:43:40.399
- Huck! So good to see you.
- Huck? Who you callin' Huck?


523
00:43:40.519 --> 00:43:44.559
Why, my name's...
Bet ya can't spell my name?


524
00:43:44.679 --> 00:43:48.720
I'll bet ya that dare.
It's G-O-R-G J-X-O-N.


525
00:43:48.840 --> 00:43:51.200
You done it, all right.
I'm George Jackson.


526
00:43:51.280 --> 00:43:53.960
Pleased to meet ya, sir.

527
00:44:10.763 --> 00:44:12.603
Say, Billy...

528
00:44:12.723 --> 00:44:15.843
why is everybody carryin' all them guns
and lookin' so itchy to use 'em?


529
00:44:15.923 --> 00:44:18.324
Well, we got us
a feud goin' on.


530
00:44:18.444 --> 00:44:20.724
Feud!
What's a feud?


531
00:44:20.844 --> 00:44:23.044
You don't know
what a feud is?


532
00:44:23.124 --> 00:44:26.485
It's like this. A man has a fight
with another man and kills him.


533
00:44:26.605 --> 00:44:29.925
Then his brother kills him. Goes
on and on with everybody's brother...


534
00:44:30.005 --> 00:44:34.166
tryin' to kill everybody else's brother,
until everybody's killed off.


535
00:44:34.286 --> 00:44:36.566
Our feud's been goin' on
for 30 years.


536
00:44:36.686 --> 00:44:40.366
30 years!
Well, how'd it start?


537
00:44:40.486 --> 00:44:44.167
- I don't know. - You mean, you don't
know why y'all killin' each other?


538
00:44:44.247 --> 00:44:46.247
Yes, sir! Yes, sir!

539
00:44:48.847 --> 00:44:53.488
Hey, Boggs! You know Pa don't want
you doin' that any more.


540
00:45:00.169 --> 00:45:02.289
- Get to work now. Come on!
- Yes, master.


541
00:45:09.770 --> 00:45:14.251
Your child got three days work
before he can move on.


542
00:45:15.771 --> 00:45:17.971
- Hello, boys.
- Hey, Pop.


543
00:45:18.091 --> 00:45:20.811
Huck!

544
00:45:20.891 --> 00:45:23.212
On that river, I had
a taste of freedom.


545
00:45:23.292 --> 00:45:27.052
And now bein' a slave again...
Well, it feels so...


546
00:45:27.132 --> 00:45:29.773
so very bad.

547
00:45:29.853 --> 00:45:33.533
Let's get on to Cairo,
Huck. Please.


548
00:45:33.653 --> 00:45:38.054
- Let's get on outta here.
- All you think about is yourself, Jim.


549
00:45:38.174 --> 00:45:42.734
Well, what about me?
Don't I deserve somethin'?


550
00:45:42.814 --> 00:45:45.775
I ain't had it so good
in all my life.


551
00:45:45.855 --> 00:45:49.535
Come on, George,
we're goin' fishin'!


552
00:45:49.655 --> 00:45:52.895
And I ain't
in no hurry to leave.


553
00:45:53.015 --> 00:45:56.056
Hey, Boggs,
this one's all yours.


554
00:46:08.377 --> 00:46:10.538
All right, come on,
get down outta there.


555
00:46:10.658 --> 00:46:13.578
Come on, over here.

556
00:46:30.580 --> 00:46:33.550
Now, my daddy was fishin'
on that other bank,


557
00:46:33.551 --> 00:46:36.261
not payin' any attention
to all the rain.


558
00:46:36.341 --> 00:46:40.942
And all of a sudden the bank gave way,
and into the river he went.


559
00:46:43.622 --> 00:46:46.782
Yeah, that's my boy.

560
00:46:49.543 --> 00:46:53.903
All you think about is
yourself, Jim. Well, what about me?


561
00:47:24.747 --> 00:47:26.827
Come on, George,
it's supper time!


562
00:47:26.947 --> 00:47:28.828
I'll be right there.

563
00:47:28.908 --> 00:47:31.228
Jim!

564
00:47:56.551 --> 00:47:58.791
Jim.

565
00:48:05.992 --> 00:48:09.353
It weren't my fault.

566
00:48:09.473 --> 00:48:12.593
If you think I feel bad,

567
00:48:12.713 --> 00:48:15.313
well, you're wrong!

568
00:48:15.433 --> 00:48:19.714
If you think I'm gonna
apologize to a slave,


569
00:48:19.794 --> 00:48:24.075
a runaway slave at that,
well, hah.


570
00:48:27.755 --> 00:48:32.116
I didn't mean for this
to happen, Jim.


571
00:48:32.236 --> 00:48:35.036
It were the worst thing
I ever done in my life.


572
00:48:35.156 --> 00:48:38.916
I'm real sorry, Jim.

573
00:48:38.996 --> 00:48:42.157
Honest, I am.

574
00:48:48.238 --> 00:48:52.118
You're still my best
and only friend.


575
00:48:52.238 --> 00:48:54.718
Huck Finn.

576
00:48:54.838 --> 00:48:58.119
Okay, all right.
Enough of this slop.


577
00:49:09.960 --> 00:49:12.721
-Jim?
- Hmm?


578
00:49:12.841 --> 00:49:15.441
'Bout time for us
to be leavin'.


579
00:49:18.201 --> 00:49:21.122
- Huck?
- Shut up, Jim.


580
00:49:23.802 --> 00:49:27.282
Sorry I'm late.

581
00:49:44.445 --> 00:49:47.325
Cyrus!
What's goin' on?


582
00:49:47.445 --> 00:49:51.166
Miss Sophie went off
to marry a Shepherdson.


583
00:49:51.286 --> 00:49:54.526
- Well, where'd everybody go?
- The women went to raise the relations.


584
00:49:54.646 --> 00:49:56.966
Billy and the menfolk, they gonna
try and kill that Shepherdson boy...


585
00:49:57.086 --> 00:50:00.807
before he crosses the river
with Miss Sophie.


586
00:50:00.927 --> 00:50:02.967
Thanks.

587
00:50:03.087 --> 00:50:05.807
Lots of people
gonna die today.


588
00:50:13.688 --> 00:50:16.209
They're right
up ahead, boy!


589
00:50:54.493 --> 00:50:56.494
Oh, let's go!

590
00:51:02.054 --> 00:51:04.295
- Hey, Billy!
- Hey, Billy.


591
00:51:04.415 --> 00:51:08.295
I-It's me, it's me! Huck...
I mean, George! What's goin' on?


592
00:51:08.415 --> 00:51:12.136
George, they ambushed us! They killed
my pa and all my brothers!


593
00:51:12.256 --> 00:51:15.336
Hell, they pert near killed us all!

594
00:51:22.057 --> 00:51:24.297
Come on, come on!

595
00:51:24.417 --> 00:51:26.458
We should've waited
for the relations.


596
00:51:26.538 --> 00:51:29.218
Them Shepherdsons
knew we were comin'!


597
00:51:32.618 --> 00:51:36.099
- What happened to Miss Sophie? - Her and
that Shepherdson made it across the river.


598
00:51:36.219 --> 00:51:38.979
Them dirty scoundrels.
George, I'm gonna kill 'em.


599
00:51:47.500 --> 00:51:50.181
Billy!

600
00:51:56.621 --> 00:51:59.462
Shoot 'im, boys!

601
00:51:59.582 --> 00:52:01.702
Don't let 'im get away!

602
00:52:42.787 --> 00:52:45.387
- See anything?
- No.


603
00:52:45.507 --> 00:52:47.868
Let's try this way!

604
00:53:17.352 --> 00:53:20.512
Huck! Huckleberry!

605
00:53:22.712 --> 00:53:27.033
You were mighty good
to me, Billy.


606
00:53:27.153 --> 00:53:31.393
I'm sorry
I didn't tell you my real name.


607
00:53:33.434 --> 00:53:35.514
It's Huck.

608
00:53:35.634 --> 00:53:39.474
Huckleberry Finn.

609
00:53:42.475 --> 00:53:45.515
I'm sorry, Billy.

610
00:53:52.116 --> 00:53:56.236
Come on, Huck.
Gotta bring him home.


611
00:54:04.637 --> 00:54:08.678
Jim and me found the
raft and fixed it up as best we could.


612
00:54:08.798 --> 00:54:13.999
It felt good gettin' back on the river.
Other places feel so cramped and smothered.


613
00:54:14.079 --> 00:54:18.799
But the river don't. You always feel
warm and safe and free on the river.


614
00:54:22.240 --> 00:54:24.080
That wasn't my fault.

615
00:54:24.160 --> 00:54:26.320
You are the sorriest
thing I've ever seen.


616
00:54:26.400 --> 00:54:29.681
That Russian fell in the river,
that's what happened.


617
00:54:29.761 --> 00:54:33.401
Hello there!
We're lookin' for Cairo!


618
00:54:33.521 --> 00:54:35.841
Can you tell us
how close we are?


619
00:54:35.961 --> 00:54:39.762
Chuckleheads, you already passed it!
It's about 40 miles back!


620
00:54:39.842 --> 00:54:41.722
Talk about lost!

621
00:54:46.843 --> 00:54:49.563
Must've missed it
that night in the fog, Jim.


622
00:54:51.803 --> 00:54:55.164
I'll be caught
and sold for sure.


623
00:54:57.884 --> 00:55:00.765
How're we gonna
get back to Cairo, Jim?


624
00:55:00.885 --> 00:55:03.925
Sure can't take this raft
back up the river.


625
00:55:04.005 --> 00:55:07.405
And no how can we fight this current.

626
00:55:07.525 --> 00:55:10.686
- No, but we could take a
steamboat upriver! - Yeah!


627
00:55:10.806 --> 00:55:14.006
We'll find one that's goin' north,
and then you can buy us passage.


628
00:55:14.086 --> 00:55:16.887
Yeah, we'll keep headin' south
'til we find us a steamboat.


629
00:55:16.967 --> 00:55:19.847
- Take it all the way back up to Cairo.
- Right up the Ohio.


630
00:55:19.967 --> 00:55:22.047
All the way up
to the free states.


631
00:55:22.207 --> 00:55:24.728
Good thinkin', Huck.

632
00:55:24.808 --> 00:55:27.608
Why, thank you, Jim.

633
00:55:33.249 --> 00:55:36.249
- Here's some more wood, Jim.
- Right there.


634
00:55:36.329 --> 00:55:38.809
Tryin' to get this fire goin'.

635
00:55:38.889 --> 00:55:40.810
Come on, Duke! Over here!

636
00:55:40.930 --> 00:55:43.650
Why are you always
stealin' chickens?


637
00:55:43.770 --> 00:55:47.050
I love chickens.
They're succulent.


638
00:55:47.170 --> 00:55:51.291
- We're chicken thieves! That's as low
as it gets. - Shut up and keep runnin'!


639
00:55:51.371 --> 00:55:55.011
It seems to me, Jim, whenever
anybody's after anybody,


640
00:55:55.131 --> 00:55:57.012
it's usually me
they's after.


641
00:56:00.012 --> 00:56:02.172
Hello there,
we's in need of assist!


642
00:56:02.252 --> 00:56:04.093
- Let's get!
- You bet!


643
00:56:04.173 --> 00:56:06.013
Grab the oars!

644
00:56:06.093 --> 00:56:10.013
- Hold up! I'm right behind you, Duke!
- Come on, push off!


645
00:56:10.093 --> 00:56:12.334
Huh?

646
00:56:12.454 --> 00:56:14.654
What the...

647
00:56:14.734 --> 00:56:18.054
Hey!
Get your own raft!


648
00:56:18.174 --> 00:56:20.615
- Thank you, lads. We'd be obliged.
- Thanks, nothin'!


649
00:56:20.735 --> 00:56:24.015
- You was gonna hightail out and just leave
us, wasn't ya? - No, I weren't. Honest.


650
00:56:24.135 --> 00:56:27.936
- Please, sir. - If ya don't let the boy
go, how's he gonna save our hides?


651
00:56:30.376 --> 00:56:32.576
Sorry, boy.

652
00:56:32.656 --> 00:56:35.617
People tryin' to kill me and...
dogs tryin' to rip my face off,


653
00:56:35.697 --> 00:56:37.777
and it ain't even breakfast yet.

654
00:56:37.897 --> 00:56:42.417
They call me the King, the King
of Bilgewater, and this here's the Duke.


655
00:56:42.537 --> 00:56:43.898
Pleased to meet ya.

656
00:56:46.578 --> 00:56:48.978
The King and
the Duke seemed like nice enough fellas,


657
00:56:49.098 --> 00:56:51.579
but something about 'em
made me feel mighty uneasy.


658
00:56:51.659 --> 00:56:53.939
They asked us
a considerable many questions.


659
00:56:54.059 --> 00:56:56.419
- Yeow! - Bull's-eye.
- And once again...


660
00:56:56.499 --> 00:56:59.019
I decided it would be best
to leave out the truth.


661
00:56:59.139 --> 00:57:02.660
So... my ma grabbed onto
the trapeze and swung one way.


662
00:57:02.740 --> 00:57:07.861
My pa came a-swingin' on the other.
My ma let go, did a double flip...


663
00:57:07.981 --> 00:57:10.541
and missed my pa
by a good six feet.


664
00:57:10.661 --> 00:57:13.781
She made quite a mess
when she hit them bleachers.


665
00:57:13.901 --> 00:57:16.662
I think this boy's gonna fit right in.

666
00:57:16.782 --> 00:57:20.022
Thank you, Jim. So what is it
you two fellas do, exactly?


667
00:57:20.142 --> 00:57:22.502
We do a fair bit
of doctorin'.


668
00:57:22.582 --> 00:57:26.063
Yeah. We can cure cancer,
paralysis, baldness.


669
00:57:26.223 --> 00:57:28.903
This time we're sellin' a thing
that takes tartar off of teeth.


670
00:57:28.983 --> 00:57:31.824
- And it does take it off too.
- But unfortunately the...


671
00:57:31.944 --> 00:57:36.024
- enamel goes right along with it.
- Yeah, well!


672
00:57:36.144 --> 00:57:39.225
We also do some theatre.
Tragedy, you know.


673
00:57:39.345 --> 00:57:42.425
Yeah, we got enough... Shakespearean
costumes here for the lot of us.


674
00:57:42.545 --> 00:57:45.785
But what we do best
are the three Es.


675
00:57:45.905 --> 00:57:47.706
Robbery, forgery...

676
00:57:47.826 --> 00:57:49.786
and burglary.

677
00:57:49.906 --> 00:57:53.706
Hell's bells!
I wish I knew a good trade.


678
00:57:53.786 --> 00:57:56.667
Well, maybe we'll teach you one, huh?

679
00:57:56.787 --> 00:58:00.027
Yeow! Go...
You skinny little rat bag!


680
00:58:00.147 --> 00:58:03.108
I'm gonna wring
your skinny little neck!


681
00:58:05.148 --> 00:58:07.828
Hey, watch it!
Stop peckin' at me!


682
00:58:10.548 --> 00:58:13.749
- Oh, good morning, boys.
- Good morning.


683
00:58:15.229 --> 00:58:17.709
Aw, hello, Duke.

684
00:58:17.829 --> 00:58:20.710
- We gotta run, now, huh?
- Naw, naw, naw, naw.


685
00:58:20.830 --> 00:58:23.350
- I just been borrowin' a few things.
- Ah, yeah.


686
00:58:23.430 --> 00:58:25.270
Nobody saw me.

687
00:58:25.350 --> 00:58:28.031
But lookee what I found.

688
00:58:31.511 --> 00:58:35.712
- You were headin' for your Uncle Billy's
plantation, huh? - Now, wait a minute.


689
00:58:35.832 --> 00:58:38.352
You're a runaway murderin' slave's
what you are.


690
00:58:38.432 --> 00:58:40.992
I think maybe I'll just
collect that reward.


691
00:58:41.112 --> 00:58:43.713
- He only murdered me.
- Now, look, we ain't exactly the type...


692
00:58:43.833 --> 00:58:45.633
to turn others
into the law.


693
00:58:45.753 --> 00:58:48.833
We stay as far away from the law
as is humanly possible.


694
00:58:48.953 --> 00:58:50.714
So if you two just, uh...

695
00:58:50.834 --> 00:58:52.994
Listen up and shut up
and do as you're told...


696
00:58:53.114 --> 00:58:56.634
-and wait on us hand and foot...
- and be real nice to us,


697
00:58:56.714 --> 00:58:58.795
we won't say a word.

698
00:58:58.915 --> 00:59:02.995
You step out of line,
try and run and...


699
00:59:13.436 --> 00:59:15.917
Oh, ho ho!

700
00:59:15.997 --> 00:59:17.837
Easy prey.

701
00:59:17.917 --> 00:59:20.157
- I'm all right!
- Ya think? - I do.


702
00:59:20.277 --> 00:59:22.558
- Shall we?
- Let's.


703
00:59:22.638 --> 00:59:25.918
Hello, there!
Happy morn to ya!


704
00:59:26.038 --> 00:59:30.079
And a good mornin'
to you all too!


705
00:59:30.199 --> 00:59:31.999
Say, you wouldn't
happen to be...


706
00:59:32.119 --> 00:59:33.919
the Wilks brothers,
now, would ya?


707
00:59:34.039 --> 00:59:35.839
- Yes.
- No!


708
00:59:35.959 --> 00:59:39.040
- No. - My name is Blodgett,
Dr. Alexander Blodgett.


709
00:59:39.160 --> 00:59:40.960
This here is Franciscus, uh,

710
00:59:41.080 --> 00:59:43.200
Adolphus and Jim.

711
00:59:43.280 --> 00:59:45.760
- Oh, shoot.
- Adolphus?


712
00:59:45.881 --> 00:59:50.401
- I reckon it don't matter. They already
missed it anyways. - Missed? What?


713
00:59:50.481 --> 00:59:52.561
Was an, um,

714
00:59:52.641 --> 00:59:54.482
economic opportunity
they missed, huh?


715
00:59:54.562 --> 00:59:56.842
Oh, ho ho!
No, no, no.


716
00:59:56.962 --> 00:59:59.882
They'll get the money
and the property all right, but...


717
01:00:00.002 --> 01:00:03.843
they missed the death
of their brother Peter Wilks...


718
01:00:03.963 --> 01:00:06.283
down at Phelps Landing.

719
01:00:06.403 --> 01:00:08.203
He died.

720
01:00:08.323 --> 01:00:10.084
Last night.

721
01:00:10.164 --> 01:00:12.804
- Too bad.
- So sad.


722
01:00:12.884 --> 01:00:17.124
Yup. He said he ain't
seen his two brothers...


723
01:00:17.244 --> 01:00:19.045
in more than 20 years.

724
01:00:19.165 --> 01:00:20.965
Yeah? So, uh,

725
01:00:21.085 --> 01:00:22.885
why did you think
we was them?


726
01:00:23.005 --> 01:00:25.405
Well, one of the brothers,
the preacher?


727
01:00:25.525 --> 01:00:27.846
He's a lot older.
And the one that's deaf and dumb...


728
01:00:27.966 --> 01:00:31.366
he's a lot younger, see.

729
01:00:31.486 --> 01:00:34.647
So when I saw you two,
I just reckoned maybe...


730
01:00:34.727 --> 01:00:38.887
- Are you leaving the area for a while?
- I'm goin' to New Orleans.


731
01:00:38.967 --> 01:00:42.808
Well, methinks this calls
for a small libation!


732
01:00:42.928 --> 01:00:44.968
- Ha ha ha ha!
- I'll drink to that!


733
01:00:45.048 --> 01:00:48.168
Right this way,
my gold-toothed friend!


734
01:00:48.248 --> 01:00:50.889
We in trouble, Huck.

735
01:00:51.009 --> 01:00:53.489
The King
and the Duke found out...


736
01:00:53.609 --> 01:00:55.409
that the dead guy's brothers
lived over in England.


737
01:00:55.529 --> 01:00:57.330
They hadn't had much time
to get the letter...


738
01:00:57.450 --> 01:00:59.250
and might not have
gotten it at all.


739
01:00:59.370 --> 01:01:02.570
So those two rat bags
grilled that flathead...


740
01:01:02.650 --> 01:01:05.050
about everything and
everybody in his village,


741
01:01:05.130 --> 01:01:07.131
right down to the damn
dog next door.


742
01:01:07.211 --> 01:01:09.051
- Woof!
- Mighty smart of ya!


743
01:01:09.131 --> 01:01:10.971
Mighty smart of ya.

744
01:01:11.051 --> 01:01:12.971
Was Peter Wilks well off?

745
01:01:13.091 --> 01:01:14.892
Oh, he was, uh,

746
01:01:15.012 --> 01:01:19.212
he was as rich
as King Soromon himself.


747
01:01:19.292 --> 01:01:21.133
I tell you, Jim,

748
01:01:21.253 --> 01:01:24.813
the hand of providence is bound
to take a swing at them two.


749
01:01:24.933 --> 01:01:27.213
And knowin' them,
they'll duck.


750
01:01:27.293 --> 01:01:29.854
How are you at
playing a preacher?


751
01:01:29.974 --> 01:01:32.494
- How are you at playin' deaf and dumb?
- Pardon?


752
01:01:32.614 --> 01:01:35.374
- Heh heh heh heh heh!
- Ha ha ha ha!


753
01:01:35.494 --> 01:01:37.375
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

754
01:01:37.495 --> 01:01:40.295
- Cheers.
- Cheers.


755
01:01:40.415 --> 01:01:42.975
Attention, passengers!

756
01:01:43.055 --> 01:01:46.576
jubilee leaving for Phelps Landing
in 15 minutes!


757
01:01:46.656 --> 01:01:48.616
Do I have to wear this?

758
01:01:48.736 --> 01:01:50.976
Wanted to learn
a trade, didn't ya?


759
01:01:51.096 --> 01:01:53.777
- Why can't we just wait here?
- Because I don't trust ya.


760
01:01:53.857 --> 01:01:55.697
You'd hightail it for sure,

761
01:01:55.777 --> 01:01:58.577
and we need to leave this raft
here for our getaway.


762
01:01:58.657 --> 01:02:00.497
Besides, we'll be
more convincing...


763
01:02:00.577 --> 01:02:03.898
after we arrive with an innocent
young boy as our valet.


764
01:02:04.018 --> 01:02:05.978
Who you callin' innocent?

765
01:02:06.098 --> 01:02:09.259
Look, you wouldn't want us
to accidentally turn in...


766
01:02:09.379 --> 01:02:12.899
your runaway slave friend,
now, would ya?


767
01:02:13.019 --> 01:02:17.260
Come on. Play along with us
for a couple of days.


768
01:02:17.380 --> 01:02:19.540
We'll give ya 10 percent.

769
01:02:19.660 --> 01:02:21.700
20.

770
01:02:21.820 --> 01:02:23.860
- 15.
- Deal.


771
01:02:23.940 --> 01:02:26.381
- You never looked better!
- I have too looked better!


772
01:02:26.501 --> 01:02:28.301
- You're beautiful!
- I feel ridiculous!


773
01:02:28.421 --> 01:02:30.261
- Hey, King!
- Yeah?


774
01:02:30.341 --> 01:02:32.141
- Let's go buy those tickets.
- All right.


775
01:02:34.222 --> 01:02:36.582
- Be right back.
- Shoo! Shoo, fly!


776
01:02:36.662 --> 01:02:38.942
Shoo!

777
01:02:42.183 --> 01:02:46.343
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!

778
01:02:49.264 --> 01:02:51.104
Funny, Huck. Very funny.

779
01:02:51.224 --> 01:02:53.944
What in hell's bells
are you supposed to be?


780
01:02:54.024 --> 01:02:56.465
The King said I was
a Swahili warrior.


781
01:02:56.585 --> 01:02:59.425
Even taught me some Swahili,
or what he said was Swahili.


782
01:02:59.545 --> 01:03:03.825
- Sounded like a pig in heat to me.
- Hee hee.


783
01:03:19.307 --> 01:03:21.148
I'd poked around a little...

784
01:03:21.228 --> 01:03:23.668
and found out that
a steamboat was leavin'...


785
01:03:23.788 --> 01:03:25.628
from Phelps Landing
the day after tomorrow...


786
01:03:25.708 --> 01:03:27.548
and headin' all the way
up to Cairo.


787
01:03:27.668 --> 01:03:31.589
So all we had to do was put up with
them rat bags for two more days,


788
01:03:31.709 --> 01:03:34.509
then it was
off to freedom.


789
01:03:45.631 --> 01:03:47.871
Uh, begging your pardon
on this,


790
01:03:47.951 --> 01:03:50.191
can any of you
good people tell me...


791
01:03:50.271 --> 01:03:53.552
where Mr. Peter Wilks
lives?


792
01:03:53.632 --> 01:03:55.472
I'm looking for
Mr. Peter Wilks.


793
01:03:55.552 --> 01:03:58.312
Get out of the way,
for heaven's sake.


794
01:04:04.193 --> 01:04:06.113
Peter's brothers,
right?


795
01:04:06.233 --> 01:04:08.234
Uh, heh-heh-heh.

796
01:04:08.354 --> 01:04:11.394
- I can tell by your fancy accent.
- But we're sorry to say...


797
01:04:11.474 --> 01:04:14.274
we can only tell you
where Peter did live...


798
01:04:14.394 --> 01:04:16.675
up until yesterday.

799
01:04:16.755 --> 01:04:19.875
Oh. What you're
tellin' me, I think,


800
01:04:19.995 --> 01:04:23.436
is that my dear,
sweet brother Peter...


801
01:04:23.556 --> 01:04:25.476
has gone to the Lord.

802
01:04:25.596 --> 01:04:29.516
He held on for you as long as he could,
but yesterday he passed.


803
01:04:33.397 --> 01:04:35.717
And we came all the way from England.

804
01:04:35.797 --> 01:04:39.318
Alas. Alas.

805
01:04:39.398 --> 01:04:43.198
And we never got to see him.

806
01:04:44.278 --> 01:04:46.118
Excuse me.

807
01:04:46.198 --> 01:04:50.079
I must communicate
with me deaf brother.


808
01:05:09.561 --> 01:05:12.802
- I told you before, she's my woman!
- No, she's not!


809
01:05:25.163 --> 01:05:28.324
Hey, don't I know you two?

810
01:05:28.444 --> 01:05:30.964
Yeah, I do!
You're that...


811
01:05:31.084 --> 01:05:33.124
Stand aside!

812
01:05:38.525 --> 01:05:41.125
Welcome to America!

813
01:05:59.528 --> 01:06:03.208
My dear, sweet Mary Jane.

814
01:06:04.368 --> 01:06:06.408
- Uncle Harvey.
- Ho-ho-ho!


815
01:06:06.529 --> 01:06:09.929
Mmm, mmm...

816
01:06:10.049 --> 01:06:13.649
Enough. Heh-heh.

817
01:06:13.729 --> 01:06:18.210
Ah, you're as bloomin' beautiful
as Peter said you was.


818
01:06:18.290 --> 01:06:20.530
- You sure are.
- Ha ha ha!


819
01:06:20.650 --> 01:06:24.411
This is my,
uh, valet, Adolphus.


820
01:06:24.531 --> 01:06:27.331
My English valet,
right?


821
01:06:27.411 --> 01:06:29.491
Right, right. Heh.

822
01:06:29.611 --> 01:06:33.932
- Isn't he the sweetest looking boy?
- Why, thank you, missus!


823
01:06:34.052 --> 01:06:36.612
Heh-heh.
Oh, and this is my Swahili warrior...


824
01:06:36.692 --> 01:06:40.693
I picked up in Africa
on a safari with the Duke of York.


825
01:06:40.773 --> 01:06:42.933
He makes a great slave.

826
01:06:50.934 --> 01:06:54.014
Yeah. Yes, of course.

827
01:06:54.135 --> 01:06:56.695
Er, might we, uh,

828
01:06:56.775 --> 01:07:00.375
pay our respects
to our brother's remainders?


829
01:07:22.218 --> 01:07:25.618
Oh, oh, yes, yes.
Rather, William.


830
01:07:25.738 --> 01:07:28.259
Uh, my brother says...

831
01:07:28.379 --> 01:07:31.579
he'd like to invite friends
of the family for supper,


832
01:07:31.699 --> 01:07:35.660
people mentioned by our dear Peter
so often in his letters.


833
01:07:35.740 --> 01:07:39.180
- No, I won't forget...
- You know, we might just prosper...


834
01:07:39.260 --> 01:07:41.981
hanging around with them two.

835
01:07:42.101 --> 01:07:45.301
More than likely,
we'll get our necks stretched.


836
01:07:47.341 --> 01:07:49.221
Well, that old King
juiced it plenty,


837
01:07:49.341 --> 01:07:52.942
spittin' out word-for-word everything
that young flathead told him.


838
01:07:53.022 --> 01:07:55.742
And how's that
damn dog next door?


839
01:07:55.862 --> 01:07:58.023
Smelly as the dickens.

840
01:07:58.143 --> 01:08:00.503
Oh, thank ya ever so.

841
01:08:00.623 --> 01:08:02.463
So I says to the pope,

842
01:08:02.543 --> 01:08:05.183
" Pope, I'd like to
stay and help ya,


843
01:08:05.263 --> 01:08:07.184
but I've got a
blinkin' job to do...


844
01:08:07.264 --> 01:08:10.264
down in the bloomin' Indian Ocean
savin' the blinkin' pirates."


845
01:08:15.425 --> 01:08:17.585
Watch yourself, Huck.

846
01:08:17.665 --> 01:08:19.585
She's just a girl, Jim.

847
01:08:19.665 --> 01:08:22.586
Adolphus, have you
ever seen the king?


848
01:08:22.706 --> 01:08:26.586
- Him? Oh, yeah. William III.
- George IV.


849
01:08:26.706 --> 01:08:29.226
Oh, the King of England!

850
01:08:29.347 --> 01:08:32.827
Oh, why didn't you bloody say so?
Course I have.


851
01:08:32.947 --> 01:08:35.347
He goes to our church, regular.

852
01:08:35.427 --> 01:08:37.868
But I thought he lived in London.

853
01:08:37.988 --> 01:08:40.508
- Well, he does.
- But you live in Sheffield.


854
01:08:41.908 --> 01:08:43.868
That is to say...

855
01:08:43.988 --> 01:08:46.429
he goes to our church
when he's in Sheffield.


856
01:08:47.749 --> 01:08:49.789
Do you go to church?

857
01:08:49.909 --> 01:08:52.789
Of course I do.
We got our own pew right up front.


858
01:08:52.869 --> 01:08:57.070
- Whose pew? - Why, ours.
Your Uncle Harvey's, of course.


859
01:08:57.190 --> 01:09:00.670
What would he need a pew for?
Isn't he preaching up in the pulpit?


860
01:09:04.511 --> 01:09:06.991
My thoughts exactly.
Now, do you suppose...


861
01:09:07.111 --> 01:09:10.432
there ain't but one bloody, blinkin'
preacher to a bloomin' church?


862
01:09:10.552 --> 01:09:14.352
- What would they want more for?
- Style.


863
01:09:14.472 --> 01:09:16.272
If it's a priest before a king,

864
01:09:16.392 --> 01:09:18.273
you got to have
lots of style goin' on.


865
01:09:18.433 --> 01:09:20.233
In our church,

866
01:09:20.353 --> 01:09:24.073
we've got 17 bloody, blinkin',
bloomin' preachers.


867
01:09:24.193 --> 01:09:27.274
- Where's Buckingham Palace?
- In Buckingham.


868
01:09:27.354 --> 01:09:30.034
- Who's the King married to?
- His wife. - What's her name?


869
01:09:30.154 --> 01:09:32.915
- Uh, the queen. - Queen
what? - Queen of England.


870
01:09:33.035 --> 01:09:36.235
Ha! You don't know anything, do ya?
Well, I think...


871
01:09:36.355 --> 01:09:38.155
-you're the biggest fibber...
-Susan!


872
01:09:38.275 --> 01:09:40.916
How dare you
speak to him so,


873
01:09:41.036 --> 01:09:43.276
him being a stranger
in a strange land,


874
01:09:43.356 --> 01:09:45.316
so far from his own people.

875
01:09:45.476 --> 01:09:49.317
He was telling a few stretchers,
and I wasn't swallowing them.


876
01:09:49.437 --> 01:09:51.877
You apologize to him
this instant.


877
01:09:55.717 --> 01:09:59.918
I apologize, Adolphus.
You're a dear, sweet boy.


878
01:09:59.998 --> 01:10:02.638
I'm ashamed
I called you a fibber.


879
01:10:06.119 --> 01:10:09.279
- Women.
- Here, now, have some pie and milk,


880
01:10:09.359 --> 01:10:14.440
- because you are so sweet.
- Why, thank you ever so.


881
01:10:18.160 --> 01:10:20.881
And these are the girls
we're lettin' those reptiles...


882
01:10:21.001 --> 01:10:22.801
rob of their money.

883
01:10:25.841 --> 01:10:28.322
- A right good day, Mary Jane!
- Good day to you, Adolphus.


884
01:10:28.402 --> 01:10:30.242
Ah, we've just been...

885
01:10:30.322 --> 01:10:32.282
for a marvelous walk in the woods.

886
01:10:32.402 --> 01:10:34.642
What a lovely country!
Ha-ha-ha!


887
01:10:34.722 --> 01:10:36.603
A right good day, sirs!

888
01:10:36.723 --> 01:10:38.523
Would you happen to know where the...

889
01:10:38.643 --> 01:10:40.563
the great Swahili
warrior's sleepin'?


890
01:10:40.683 --> 01:10:44.884
We decided the Swahili bit was pushing
it and asked him to wait at the raft.


891
01:10:44.964 --> 01:10:46.924
Well, what about...

892
01:10:47.044 --> 01:10:48.884
- A good lad!
- Here it is, Uncle.


893
01:10:48.964 --> 01:10:50.924
Father said only you
should open it.


894
01:10:51.044 --> 01:10:53.605
Oh. Bless him.

895
01:10:55.765 --> 01:11:00.126
" Last Will and Testament
of Peter J. Wilks.


896
01:11:00.246 --> 01:11:03.006
I, Peter J. Wilks,
being of sound mind..."


897
01:11:03.126 --> 01:11:05.606
Well, the dead
geezer gave the girls his houses,


898
01:11:05.686 --> 01:11:08.607
the slaves, and thousands
of dollars in gold.


899
01:11:08.727 --> 01:11:10.527
Then he gave more gold...

900
01:11:10.647 --> 01:11:15.127
"to my dear, beloved brothers
Harvey and William."


901
01:11:15.247 --> 01:11:19.808
Praise be to the Lord.

902
01:11:19.928 --> 01:11:25.449
Er, "The gold is hidden in the barn
behind the vineyards."


903
01:11:25.529 --> 01:11:29.209
Well, William, I guess we better
go and get it.


904
01:11:33.970 --> 01:11:36.250
- Well?
- Well?


905
01:11:36.330 --> 01:11:39.651
There, behind the grindstone.

906
01:11:57.133 --> 01:12:00.333
Aah! Allow me.

907
01:12:04.654 --> 01:12:06.694
Wow!

908
01:12:13.775 --> 01:12:16.215
Begging your pardon!
Hmph!


909
01:12:16.335 --> 01:12:18.775
If this ain't bully, nothing is.

910
01:12:18.895 --> 01:12:20.736
Like I told you this morning,

911
01:12:20.816 --> 01:12:22.976
we're goin' all the way
with this one.


912
01:12:23.056 --> 01:12:25.776
All for us and none for them.
Let's count it.


913
01:12:29.537 --> 01:12:33.537
I don't think it's right, us stealin
from them nice girls.


914
01:12:36.178 --> 01:12:39.018
You're in it now,
you little stinkweed.


915
01:12:39.138 --> 01:12:42.458
- Right up to your sneaky little eyeballs.
-And if it goes wrong...


916
01:12:42.578 --> 01:12:44.739
You'll take your punishment
right along with us.


917
01:12:44.819 --> 01:12:47.499
Ya know what they'll
do if they catch us?


918
01:12:47.619 --> 01:12:50.579
Ya know what happens to ya
when they tar and feather ya?


919
01:12:50.659 --> 01:12:53.060
- Do ya?
- No, sirs!


920
01:12:53.180 --> 01:12:55.420
No, I... I don't know!

921
01:12:56.660 --> 01:12:59.981
The tar oozes into your pores.

922
01:13:00.101 --> 01:13:02.821
Clogs 'em up real tight.

923
01:13:02.941 --> 01:13:06.501
- Suffocates your skin.
- Ya get all green and sick.


924
01:13:06.621 --> 01:13:08.742
Then ya choke and ya cough.

925
01:13:08.822 --> 01:13:11.262
Until ya tear your own flesh
so's ya can breathe.


926
01:13:11.382 --> 01:13:13.542
But ya can't breathe!

927
01:13:13.622 --> 01:13:16.543
And half the time,
ya die from it.


928
01:13:16.663 --> 01:13:18.543
And those
that don't die...


929
01:13:18.663 --> 01:13:20.463
feel so bad,
they wish that they had.


930
01:13:20.583 --> 01:13:23.904
And that's just what'll happen to you
if ya open your mouth.


931
01:13:26.344 --> 01:13:28.344
Hey.

932
01:13:28.424 --> 01:13:31.945
Maybe young Adolphus here
has the right idea.


933
01:13:32.065 --> 01:13:34.945
We should give the money
back to the girls.


934
01:13:36.665 --> 01:13:39.466
That's a dazzling idea, King.

935
01:13:39.546 --> 01:13:42.466
- That'll knock over their suspicions.
- Shut 'em up for good.


936
01:13:42.586 --> 01:13:45.146
- Until we steal it all back.
- Yeah, we give them the money...


937
01:13:45.226 --> 01:13:48.987
and that gives us the time
to steal everything else.


938
01:13:49.067 --> 01:13:51.627
Genius.

939
01:13:51.747 --> 01:13:53.867
We're gonna be set for life!

940
01:13:53.987 --> 01:13:57.708
I'd had enough,
and steamboat or no steamboat,


941
01:13:57.788 --> 01:13:59.948
I figured it were time
to grab Jim...


942
01:14:00.068 --> 01:14:02.469
and hightail it to Cairo.

943
01:14:05.789 --> 01:14:09.629
Heh-heh. Friends,
our dear departed...


944
01:14:09.709 --> 01:14:12.750
has done generous
to his little lambs,


945
01:14:12.870 --> 01:14:14.950
and as their uncles,

946
01:14:15.070 --> 01:14:18.671
I think we'd
like to enhance...


947
01:14:18.751 --> 01:14:21.791
the generous spirit
of the day.


948
01:14:29.232 --> 01:14:32.752
You see, I knew he'd
feel the same as me.


949
01:14:32.832 --> 01:14:36.753
Mary Jane, Julia, Susan,

950
01:14:36.873 --> 01:14:38.673
take the money.

951
01:14:38.793 --> 01:14:41.593
Take it all.
A gift from your uncles.


952
01:14:41.713 --> 01:14:45.394
- Wonderful!
- Dear souls, how could you?


953
01:14:45.514 --> 01:14:48.394
Englishman, my butt!

954
01:14:48.514 --> 01:14:50.355
You're a couple of frauds.

955
01:14:50.435 --> 01:14:52.875
I beg your pardon.
And who might you be?


956
01:14:52.995 --> 01:14:56.115
Dr. Robinson, ain't you heard?
They're Peter's brothers.


957
01:14:56.195 --> 01:15:00.636
Doctor...
Dr. Robinson! Oh!


958
01:15:00.756 --> 01:15:03.956
My brother's, oh, good friend
and physician.


959
01:15:04.076 --> 01:15:06.677
Take your hand away from me,
you impostor!


960
01:15:06.757 --> 01:15:09.077
They proved it 40 ways
that they're the brothers.


961
01:15:09.197 --> 01:15:12.397
- They even knew everything about
the village! - And everybody's name!


962
01:15:12.517 --> 01:15:15.358
- They even know about the damn
dog next door. - Enough!


963
01:15:15.478 --> 01:15:17.438
They came here
with lots of names and facts...


964
01:15:17.558 --> 01:15:20.278
they must've picked up
somewhere, that's all.


965
01:15:20.358 --> 01:15:22.719
Yup,
it was time to leave, all right.


966
01:15:22.839 --> 01:15:25.879
I could smell the winds a-changin',
and they stunk.


967
01:15:25.959 --> 01:15:27.839
Turn these rascals out,
I beg you.


968
01:15:27.959 --> 01:15:30.400
They're liars.

969
01:15:30.520 --> 01:15:32.400
Based on what evidence?

970
01:15:38.001 --> 01:15:40.641
Here's my answer, doctor.

971
01:15:40.761 --> 01:15:45.281
Uncle Harvey, Uncle William,

972
01:15:45.401 --> 01:15:48.122
take the gold back...

973
01:15:48.202 --> 01:15:50.882
and invest it for me
and my sisters any way you want.


974
01:15:51.002 --> 01:15:53.883
That's my answer, doctor.

975
01:15:54.003 --> 01:15:56.043
Whooo!

976
01:15:59.323 --> 01:16:01.163
Marvellous.

977
01:16:02.964 --> 01:16:05.844
I hated to run out
on them sweet girls,


978
01:16:05.964 --> 01:16:07.804
but I figured
if I stuck around,


979
01:16:07.884 --> 01:16:10.485
that dead geezer 'n'me
would be sharin' lodgin's.


980
01:16:12.285 --> 01:16:16.165
Hey, you seen a big slave around,
maybe hangin' on my raft?


981
01:16:16.285 --> 01:16:19.406
You bet I was. Two men catched him,
and now he's in jail.


982
01:16:19.486 --> 01:16:21.726
- What?
- They had a handbill...


983
01:16:21.806 --> 01:16:24.126
that said he was a murderer
and a runaway...


984
01:16:24.206 --> 01:16:26.407
- and worth $400.
- So where is he now?


985
01:16:26.527 --> 01:16:28.847
Took him down
to the jail in Phelps Landing.


986
01:16:28.927 --> 01:16:31.727
- Phelps Landing.
- Yeah, we're gonna keep him there...


987
01:16:31.807 --> 01:16:35.128
until we can take him up north
for the hangin'.


988
01:16:37.648 --> 01:16:41.769
I'm gonna fix their wagons
but good.


989
01:16:41.969 --> 01:16:44.809
I'd come all the way
down the Mississippi...


990
01:16:44.929 --> 01:16:46.729
and hadn't gotten anywhere,

991
01:16:46.849 --> 01:16:50.290
and I realized right then that ya
can't run away from your problems,


992
01:16:50.370 --> 01:16:52.370
ya gotta make a stand
and face 'em.


993
01:16:52.450 --> 01:16:55.210
I didn't tell 'em nothin'.
I didn't want to get you in any trouble.


994
01:16:55.330 --> 01:16:57.211
Good,
because my butt's hangin' way out,


995
01:16:57.331 --> 01:16:59.651
and I'd rather
not get it shot off.


996
01:16:59.771 --> 01:17:01.571
I got to tell 'em
you're not a murderer.


997
01:17:01.691 --> 01:17:03.491
That don't matter.

998
01:17:03.611 --> 01:17:06.372
Me bein' a runaway's even worse
than me bein' a murderer.


999
01:17:06.452 --> 01:17:09.892
The steamboat leaves the wharf
at 10:00 tomorrow tonight.


1000
01:17:10.012 --> 01:17:13.093
Don't you worry, Jim.
We'll both be on it.


1001
01:17:13.173 --> 01:17:16.773
There's something I got to tell ya
before you risking yourself for me.


1002
01:17:16.853 --> 01:17:19.773
You know that night on the steamboat
with all them murderers?


1003
01:17:19.893 --> 01:17:22.774
Yeah.

1004
01:17:22.854 --> 01:17:25.454
Your Pap was one of 'em.

1005
01:17:25.574 --> 01:17:28.735
I saw him, and he was dead.

1006
01:17:32.375 --> 01:17:34.775
Dead?

1007
01:17:34.855 --> 01:17:36.816
Pap's dead?

1008
01:17:38.856 --> 01:17:41.896
- You saw him and you didn't tell me?
- I'm sorry.


1009
01:17:43.176 --> 01:17:45.937
I'm dreadful sorry.
I was so selfish.


1010
01:17:46.057 --> 01:17:47.857
That was a lie, Jim.

1011
01:17:47.977 --> 01:17:50.417
That was a lie!

1012
01:17:50.537 --> 01:17:53.258
And I thought we were friends.

1013
01:17:53.378 --> 01:17:56.298
I did wrong.
Ain't no gettin' around it.


1014
01:17:58.338 --> 01:18:00.138
Now I'm gonna get
what I deserve.


1015
01:18:00.259 --> 01:18:04.059
- Hey, boy!
- Take care of yourself, Mr. Finn.


1016
01:18:25.342 --> 01:18:27.662
Now, where have you been,
you little turd pie?


1017
01:18:27.742 --> 01:18:30.382
just playin' with
the damn dog next door.


1018
01:18:30.502 --> 01:18:33.023
Just playing with the little doggies?
I oughta...


1019
01:18:33.103 --> 01:18:35.503
Just stay right here today!
Understand? Hmm?


1020
01:18:35.623 --> 01:18:38.423
Ladies and gentlemen!
Ladies and gentlemen!


1021
01:18:38.543 --> 01:18:41.904
What's that
old fool up to now?


1022
01:18:42.024 --> 01:18:46.344
Me dear brother and I have a little
announcement we'd like to make.


1023
01:18:46.464 --> 01:18:48.985
It don't seem right...

1024
01:18:49.105 --> 01:18:54.545
for William and I to leave
these little lambs...


1025
01:18:54.625 --> 01:18:57.266
without any kinfolk around.

1026
01:18:57.346 --> 01:18:59.786
So we have decided,

1027
01:18:59.906 --> 01:19:03.867
er, Mary Jane,
Julia, Susan...


1028
01:19:05.267 --> 01:19:08.267
We have decided...

1029
01:19:08.387 --> 01:19:10.907
to take you back
with us to England!


1030
01:19:13.988 --> 01:19:16.508
We'll be havin' an auction
tomorrow mornin'...


1031
01:19:16.628 --> 01:19:18.508
after the funeral,

1032
01:19:18.628 --> 01:19:22.029
- so tell one and all!
- We will be selling everything!


1033
01:19:22.149 --> 01:19:23.989
We're going to England!

1034
01:19:31.630 --> 01:19:35.070
I figured that
before I took off,


1035
01:19:35.190 --> 01:19:37.911
I'd grab that gold
away from them two frauds.


1036
01:19:38.031 --> 01:19:40.031
Then when I was long gone,

1037
01:19:40.151 --> 01:19:42.671
I'd write Mary Jane
and tell her where I hid it.


1038
01:19:58.953 --> 01:20:00.994
Well, what is it?
Make it quick.


1039
01:20:01.114 --> 01:20:04.434
I gotta tell ya, King,
I'm just not comfortable.


1040
01:20:04.554 --> 01:20:07.195
That doctor's been layin'
on my mind all day.


1041
01:20:07.275 --> 01:20:10.875
We should just glide out
of here tonight with what we got.


1042
01:20:10.995 --> 01:20:12.795
And not sell the rest
of the property?


1043
01:20:12.915 --> 01:20:15.316
I reckon these sacks of gold
are plenty for me.


1044
01:20:15.436 --> 01:20:17.756
I figure we should just
knock off and light out.


1045
01:20:17.836 --> 01:20:20.756
We can't leave thousands of
dollars worth of property lying around.


1046
01:20:20.876 --> 01:20:23.397
What about
the damn doctor?


1047
01:20:23.517 --> 01:20:26.557
Forget about the doctor!
He's the only one that's suspicious.


1048
01:20:26.637 --> 01:20:28.437
Everyone else
is on our side!


1049
01:20:28.557 --> 01:20:30.557
Now, look, Duke, old friend.

1050
01:20:30.677 --> 01:20:32.958
My brains and your bullocks,

1051
01:20:33.038 --> 01:20:34.998
we ain't never
gonna get caught.


1052
01:20:35.118 --> 01:20:37.918
Yeah, all right.

1053
01:20:37.998 --> 01:20:40.799
Well, just let me
take another peek at that gold...


1054
01:20:40.879 --> 01:20:42.999
before we head back down.

1055
01:20:52.480 --> 01:20:56.361
Slice of heaven, King.
Feels like a slice of heaven.


1056
01:20:56.481 --> 01:20:58.681
Come on!

1057
01:21:27.525 --> 01:21:30.565
My Pap were a bad one,

1058
01:21:30.645 --> 01:21:32.445
but he were my Pap.

1059
01:21:35.526 --> 01:21:37.886
If you see him,

1060
01:21:38.006 --> 01:21:40.646
tell him Huck says hello.

1061
01:21:40.766 --> 01:21:42.767
Good night!

1062
01:22:44.894 --> 01:22:46.815
Where's the stiff?

1063
01:22:46.895 --> 01:22:49.775
- What? Who?
- The coffin! Where's the coffin?


1064
01:22:49.855 --> 01:22:51.695
We buried him this morning.

1065
01:22:51.815 --> 01:22:55.096
And ever since, Uncle Harvey's
been having the auction.


1066
01:22:55.216 --> 01:22:58.256
First thing he sold
were the slaves.


1067
01:22:58.376 --> 01:23:00.536
He separated the families.

1068
01:23:02.057 --> 01:23:03.857
- Come on!
- Where are we going?


1069
01:23:03.977 --> 01:23:07.457
- Got any friends out in the country?
- Yes, the Lothrups. Why?


1070
01:23:07.537 --> 01:23:10.738
If I tell you somethin', promise not to
come back here until 10:00 tonight.


1071
01:23:10.818 --> 01:23:13.698
- Now, why would I do that?
-Just promise me, Mary Jane!


1072
01:23:13.778 --> 01:23:15.898
All right, I...
I promise. Say...


1073
01:23:16.018 --> 01:23:18.219
what happened
to your accent?


1074
01:23:19.699 --> 01:23:22.419
Those uncles of yours
ain't no uncles at all.


1075
01:23:22.539 --> 01:23:24.859
They ain't even English.

1076
01:23:24.979 --> 01:23:29.340
Dr. Robinson was right.
Them two are liars and frauds.


1077
01:23:29.460 --> 01:23:32.540
- What?
- Don't you worry! I got the gold.


1078
01:23:32.660 --> 01:23:35.861
When this all blows over, I'll write
and tell ya where it's buried.


1079
01:23:35.981 --> 01:23:39.061
Oh, no. I'm gonna get those two
right now and get 'em tarred...


1080
01:23:39.141 --> 01:23:43.222
No, you're not, Mary Jane.
You promised me.


1081
01:23:43.302 --> 01:23:46.142
Why until 10:00?

1082
01:23:46.262 --> 01:23:49.583
'Cause there's a good-hearted fellow
I gotta save,


1083
01:23:49.703 --> 01:23:52.423
and at 10:00, we'll be gone.
Come on.


1084
01:23:52.503 --> 01:23:54.423
Well, why do I have
to leave town?


1085
01:23:54.503 --> 01:23:56.943
Why can't I just pretend
I don't know?


1086
01:23:57.063 --> 01:23:59.784
Because there ain't an easier book
to read than your face.


1087
01:23:59.864 --> 01:24:02.024
You'd give it away
for sure.


1088
01:24:07.145 --> 01:24:09.065
Even $225... $225...

1089
01:24:09.145 --> 01:24:12.225
$225... $240... $275...

1090
01:24:12.345 --> 01:24:14.746
$300... now higher...

1091
01:24:14.866 --> 01:24:16.786
- $350.
- $375... $375...


1092
01:24:16.906 --> 01:24:18.746
- Yeah.
- $375 and a $400.


1093
01:24:18.826 --> 01:24:22.547
Even $400. Sold, $400!
Let's sell the next lot.


1094
01:24:27.787 --> 01:24:30.508
Mary Jane
was safe, the gold was safe,


1095
01:24:30.588 --> 01:24:33.308
them reptiles
would soon be in jail,


1096
01:24:33.388 --> 01:24:36.668
and at 10.00 tonight, Jim and me
would be on a steamboat...


1097
01:24:36.749 --> 01:24:38.709
headin' for Cairo.

1098
01:24:38.829 --> 01:24:41.629
All I had to do
was find that deputy,


1099
01:24:41.709 --> 01:24:44.549
steal his keys,
and break Jim oouut!


1100
01:24:44.669 --> 01:24:46.470
- Oh, I told you...
- Let me go!


1101
01:24:46.590 --> 01:24:49.430
- not to disappear! Didn't I?
- Let me go!


1102
01:24:49.550 --> 01:24:54.111
Oh, now,
don't kill him...just yet.


1103
01:24:54.191 --> 01:24:56.351
Answer up, and quick.

1104
01:24:56.431 --> 01:24:59.951
- Were you in our room last night?
- No, your maj... Unh!


1105
01:25:00.031 --> 01:25:01.872
Where is our money?

1106
01:25:01.952 --> 01:25:04.872
I ain't seen it since
Mary Jane gave it to ya.


1107
01:25:04.992 --> 01:25:08.953
Honest, your majesties!
If I stole it, would I still be here?


1108
01:25:09.073 --> 01:25:11.313
No, I guess not,
unless you're a complete numskull.


1109
01:25:20.794 --> 01:25:22.714
Uh-oh.

1110
01:25:22.834 --> 01:25:26.115
Here's another
set of Wilks brothers!


1111
01:25:26.235 --> 01:25:29.315
Just got here on
the Mississippi Queen!


1112
01:25:29.395 --> 01:25:32.396
Ya pays your money
and ya takes your pick!


1113
01:25:32.516 --> 01:25:35.556
Now is the hour of
your demise, you impostors!


1114
01:25:37.596 --> 01:25:40.036
What's this all about,
my good sir?


1115
01:25:40.156 --> 01:25:43.557
- Please let the man through!
- That's right!


1116
01:25:43.677 --> 01:25:46.077
I'm with you, Harvey.

1117
01:25:46.197 --> 01:25:49.518
I am Harvey Wilks,
and this is my brother William.


1118
01:25:49.638 --> 01:25:52.998
And you two gentlemen
are quite a surprise to us.


1119
01:25:53.118 --> 01:25:54.918
And you to us, sir.

1120
01:25:55.038 --> 01:25:56.839
But I must say,

1121
01:25:56.959 --> 01:26:00.679
you should have worked on your
English accent a wee bit more!


1122
01:26:00.759 --> 01:26:03.079
For this town
has few fools,


1123
01:26:03.199 --> 01:26:07.080
and only a fool would be
fooled by that foolish accent.


1124
01:26:07.200 --> 01:26:10.520
That's the worst
English accent I ever heard.


1125
01:26:10.600 --> 01:26:14.001
- Ain't nothin' like yours, Harve.
- I'm not very well fixed...


1126
01:26:14.121 --> 01:26:15.921
to show proof of
these frauds at the moment,


1127
01:26:16.041 --> 01:26:19.521
for last night,
all our bags were put off by mistake.


1128
01:26:19.641 --> 01:26:22.722
- Convenient mistake, huh?
- Yeah, convenient.


1129
01:26:31.363 --> 01:26:34.163
What are you doing?
What's he doing?


1130
01:26:34.283 --> 01:26:37.164
Making deaf and dumb signs,
that's what he's doing.


1131
01:26:37.284 --> 01:26:40.204
- Don't your brother know how?
- Those are just nonsense!


1132
01:26:40.324 --> 01:26:42.404
And of course William
can do real ones,


1133
01:26:42.524 --> 01:26:45.005
only he broke
his arm in a fall.


1134
01:26:45.125 --> 01:26:48.045
Ah-ha-ha!
Broke his arm, very likely,


1135
01:26:48.165 --> 01:26:51.566
for a man who's got to make
deaf signs to prove himself.


1136
01:26:51.686 --> 01:26:54.806
Oh, wait,
wait, wait!


1137
01:26:54.926 --> 01:26:58.606
Now, I'm not sure these two
are the real Wilks brothers,


1138
01:26:58.686 --> 01:27:00.807
but by God, I know
them two sure ain't.


1139
01:27:02.207 --> 01:27:04.927
By the way, Adolphus,

1140
01:27:05.007 --> 01:27:08.688
- are you from England?
- Why, yes, I am.


1141
01:27:08.768 --> 01:27:10.608
Speak the truth now,

1142
01:27:10.688 --> 01:27:13.648
or by God, there's gonna be
one less idiot around here.


1143
01:27:13.768 --> 01:27:16.209
That is to say, sir,

1144
01:27:16.329 --> 01:27:18.129
I'm originally from Missouri,

1145
01:27:18.249 --> 01:27:20.529
but several years ago,
I was sent to England...


1146
01:27:20.649 --> 01:27:22.649
to live with
my great-grandfather,


1147
01:27:22.769 --> 01:27:25.970
- the Duke of Bilgewater.
- Bilgewater?


1148
01:27:26.090 --> 01:27:28.250
But he died last year,

1149
01:27:28.370 --> 01:27:30.730
and his good friend,

1150
01:27:30.850 --> 01:27:33.811
Mr. Harvey Wilks here,
took me in.


1151
01:27:35.851 --> 01:27:38.811
Personally, I think
you're just a damn good liar.


1152
01:27:38.931 --> 01:27:40.972
Why, thank you for
the compliment, sir.


1153
01:27:43.012 --> 01:27:45.652
All right, enough.

1154
01:27:45.732 --> 01:27:48.573
We're gonna figure out
who's who right here and now,


1155
01:27:48.693 --> 01:27:52.893
and nobody's goin' nowhere
until we do.


1156
01:27:55.854 --> 01:27:58.934
Well, they sailed
into the investigation,


1157
01:27:59.054 --> 01:28:00.854
hour in and hour out,

1158
01:28:00.974 --> 01:28:03.015
the King tellin'
one story and Harvey Wilks another.


1159
01:28:03.095 --> 01:28:05.615
But no one knew nothin'
about England,


1160
01:28:05.735 --> 01:28:08.055
so they couldn't
figure out who was lyin'.


1161
01:28:08.175 --> 01:28:10.255
Although most people were comin'
to believe they both was.


1162
01:28:10.375 --> 01:28:12.256
I got it! I got it!

1163
01:28:12.376 --> 01:28:15.096
I can prove I'm Harvey Wilks
and these men frauds!


1164
01:28:15.176 --> 01:28:17.776
Why didn't I think
of it sooner?


1165
01:28:17.896 --> 01:28:20.257
Now, who here
helped lay out my brother...


1166
01:28:20.377 --> 01:28:24.857
- the late Peter Wilks... in his
coffin? Hmm? - They did!


1167
01:28:24.977 --> 01:28:28.138
Me and Abe here dressed him up
and layed him out ourselves.


1168
01:28:28.218 --> 01:28:30.058
All right, then.

1169
01:28:30.138 --> 01:28:35.259
Perhaps you can tell me what was
tattooed on Peter's breast.


1170
01:28:35.339 --> 01:28:37.859
Come on!

1171
01:28:37.979 --> 01:28:40.419
Come on, out with it!

1172
01:28:40.539 --> 01:28:42.499
We want to hear it!

1173
01:28:42.620 --> 01:28:44.700
- Out with it!
- Yeah!


1174
01:28:44.820 --> 01:28:46.620
All right, all right.

1175
01:28:46.740 --> 01:28:49.820
I can tell you what was tattooed
on his breast, all right.


1176
01:28:49.940 --> 01:28:52.861
You'd have to look
real close to notice it.


1177
01:28:52.981 --> 01:28:55.421
Just tell us
what the tattoo is about!


1178
01:28:55.541 --> 01:28:57.661
Come on, out with it!
Tell him!


1179
01:28:57.781 --> 01:29:00.382
- Come on!
- Get to it!


1180
01:29:00.462 --> 01:29:03.622
It was a small...

1181
01:29:03.742 --> 01:29:06.503
thin...

1182
01:29:06.623 --> 01:29:08.423
blue...

1183
01:29:12.943 --> 01:29:14.904
- arrow!
- Arrow?


1184
01:29:15.024 --> 01:29:19.264
- Yes! There! You all heard what he said?
- Yeah!


1185
01:29:19.384 --> 01:29:21.624
Did you see any such mark?

1186
01:29:25.465 --> 01:29:27.745
- Nope.
- Nope.


1187
01:29:27.865 --> 01:29:29.785
You fraud!

1188
01:29:34.066 --> 01:29:37.866
That's right, because
there isn't any blue arrow.


1189
01:29:37.986 --> 01:29:40.827
Peter had his initials
tattooed on his breast,


1190
01:29:40.947 --> 01:29:42.787
the letters " P" and "W".

1191
01:29:42.867 --> 01:29:45.027
Well, come on, then!

1192
01:29:45.107 --> 01:29:47.948
Isn't that what you saw?

1193
01:29:48.068 --> 01:29:49.868
I didn't see
any tattoo, did you?


1194
01:29:49.988 --> 01:29:53.028
I never noticed
no tattoo at all!


1195
01:29:53.148 --> 01:29:55.309
They're all frauds!

1196
01:29:56.869 --> 01:29:59.429
- I say we tar 'em!
- Yeah!


1197
01:29:59.549 --> 01:30:01.869
- I say we shoot 'em!
- Yeah!


1198
01:30:01.990 --> 01:30:04.390
- I say we hang 'em!
- Yeah!


1199
01:30:04.510 --> 01:30:06.390
Hang 'em!
Hang all of 'em!


1200
01:30:06.470 --> 01:30:09.951
Gentlemen! Gentlemen!

1201
01:30:10.071 --> 01:30:13.351
There is one way to see which pair
is the real Wilks brothers,


1202
01:30:13.431 --> 01:30:15.431
or if neither of them is!

1203
01:30:15.551 --> 01:30:17.631
Let's dig up the corpse!

1204
01:30:17.752 --> 01:30:19.912
Yeah!

1205
01:30:23.272 --> 01:30:25.352
To the cemetery!

1206
01:30:42.755 --> 01:30:44.555
We've got the tar!

1207
01:31:32.641 --> 01:31:34.481
Well?

1208
01:31:34.561 --> 01:31:36.361
Dig it up!

1209
01:32:01.525 --> 01:32:04.725
- Hey, we found it, doc!
- They hit it!


1210
01:32:08.085 --> 01:32:11.006
All right, heave!

1211
01:32:16.486 --> 01:32:18.287
Won't be long now,
Deputy Hines!


1212
01:32:22.607 --> 01:32:25.648
- Push it! Push it!
- Got it?


1213
01:32:26.968 --> 01:32:29.848
- Almost got it!
Push!


1214
01:32:33.609 --> 01:32:35.649
- Eeewwhh!
- Oh!


1215
01:32:42.130 --> 01:32:46.170
My good God!
There's gold in there!


1216
01:32:46.290 --> 01:32:48.130
Aah!

1217
01:32:49.971 --> 01:32:52.851
It's the Wilks' gold!

1218
01:32:57.372 --> 01:32:59.172
We'd best be goin', Jim!

1219
01:32:59.292 --> 01:33:02.772
Huck? I thought you'd have
your neck stretched by now!


1220
01:33:02.892 --> 01:33:05.453
I'm a little quicker
than that.


1221
01:33:05.533 --> 01:33:08.133
- Why, Huck?
- Why, what?


1222
01:33:08.253 --> 01:33:10.973
Why'd ya come and get me?

1223
01:33:11.093 --> 01:33:13.454
'Cause you're my friend, Jim.

1224
01:33:15.534 --> 01:33:18.134
Oh, come on.

1225
01:33:19.614 --> 01:33:21.895
Now, let's get
to that steamboat!


1226
01:33:48.258 --> 01:33:52.179
- Come on!
- It's the boy with that runaway slave!


1227
01:33:52.259 --> 01:33:54.299
- Hit the trail!
- Get 'em!


1228
01:34:00.020 --> 01:34:02.140
Fire!

1229
01:34:11.901 --> 01:34:13.701
Aah! Unh!

1230
01:34:14.781 --> 01:34:16.582
You all right, Huck?

1231
01:34:16.702 --> 01:34:19.862
I just tripped. I'm all right.
Keep goin'!


1232
01:34:19.942 --> 01:34:23.022
Unh! Unh!

1233
01:34:23.142 --> 01:34:25.983
Last call for Cairo
and all points north!


1234
01:34:26.103 --> 01:34:27.983
All aboard!

1235
01:34:28.103 --> 01:34:29.903
Almost there, Huck!

1236
01:34:35.704 --> 01:34:39.505
We made it, Huck!
Huck?


1237
01:34:39.625 --> 01:34:43.105
Oh! Oh, my little friend!

1238
01:34:43.225 --> 01:34:45.185
Oh. Oh.

1239
01:34:45.305 --> 01:34:48.226
- Go on, Jim. Go on.
- I ain't goin' nowhere without you.


1240
01:34:48.346 --> 01:34:51.746
- What are ya doin',Jim?
They'll catch ya.


1241
01:34:51.866 --> 01:34:53.706
They won't find ya
in the dark.


1242
01:34:53.786 --> 01:34:55.627
I got to get ya to a doctor.

1243
01:34:55.707 --> 01:34:57.907
I'll be okay.
Ya...


1244
01:34:58.027 --> 01:35:01.787
Ya can't take me, Jim.
They'll catch ya.


1245
01:35:01.867 --> 01:35:03.708
They'll lynch ya.

1246
01:35:03.788 --> 01:35:07.748
- Don't go, Jim.
- Last call for Cairo! Last call for Cairo!


1247
01:35:07.868 --> 01:35:11.389
- All aboard!
- I don't care what happens to me, Huck.


1248
01:35:11.469 --> 01:35:13.789
I just want
to get you well.


1249
01:35:13.869 --> 01:35:16.469
Jim...Jim...

1250
01:35:19.870 --> 01:35:22.350
We had us
a great adventure, didn't we, Jim?


1251
01:35:22.470 --> 01:35:25.230
- We sure did, Huck.
- And I'd do it all over again.


1252
01:35:25.350 --> 01:35:28.151
Yeah.

1253
01:35:28.271 --> 01:35:30.271
Get 'em!

1254
01:35:30.351 --> 01:35:32.271
Oh!

1255
01:35:32.391 --> 01:35:35.392
You can't...
You can't kill him.


1256
01:35:35.472 --> 01:35:39.152
Don't you cry for me,
Mr. Finn.


1257
01:35:39.232 --> 01:35:42.072
You're the best friend
I ever had, Jim.


1258
01:35:42.192 --> 01:35:44.073
You're the only friend
I ever had.


1259
01:35:45.473 --> 01:35:47.593
Ya can't.

1260
01:35:50.793 --> 01:35:53.194
Aah! No!

1261
01:35:56.994 --> 01:35:58.634
Jim!

1262
01:36:00.995 --> 01:36:04.275
No, ya can't take him.

1263
01:36:04.395 --> 01:36:07.276
He's all I got.

1264
01:36:07.396 --> 01:36:09.436
Ready?

1265
01:36:12.876 --> 01:36:15.477
- Tighten it up.
- Aah! Aah!


1266
01:36:15.597 --> 01:36:18.397
Leave the boy alone! 
He's innocent!

1267
01:36:18.517 --> 01:36:21.357
- Now, Mary Jane!
- And if he was trying to help that slave,


1268
01:36:21.477 --> 01:36:23.318
he had a good reason for it.

1269
01:36:23.398 --> 01:36:25.998
Now you let them both go!

1270
01:36:29.878 --> 01:36:32.639
Now!

1271
01:36:35.399 --> 01:36:37.239
Aw, let him go.

1272
01:36:39.760 --> 01:36:41.840
Lucky day, boy!

1273
01:37:18.125 --> 01:37:20.165
You're awake.

1274
01:37:20.285 --> 01:37:22.885
He's awake.
He's awake!


1275
01:37:23.005 --> 01:37:26.966
Sweetie, we were so worried about you
but you're going to be all right now.


1276
01:37:27.086 --> 01:37:29.526
My little Huckleberry!

1277
01:37:31.166 --> 01:37:34.287
Widow Douglas.
Why, how'd you get here?


1278
01:37:34.367 --> 01:37:37.847
Lands, child.
You've been out cold for a week.


1279
01:37:37.967 --> 01:37:41.247
When I heard what happened,
I took the first steamer down.


1280
01:37:41.367 --> 01:37:45.568
Well, I'm sure ya think
I'm low-down and miserable...


1281
01:37:45.688 --> 01:37:49.208
for tryin'
to set Jim free,


1282
01:37:49.328 --> 01:37:53.089
- but do ya hate me?
- Not at all, child.


1283
01:37:53.209 --> 01:37:58.170
I'm right proud of you. Just because
an idea is popular, like slavery,


1284
01:37:58.290 --> 01:38:00.570
don't make it right.

1285
01:38:00.690 --> 01:38:02.650
That's what Jim told me.

1286
01:38:02.770 --> 01:38:06.251
Your little heart
guided you quite well.


1287
01:38:09.371 --> 01:38:11.771
Hey, Jim!

1288
01:38:11.891 --> 01:38:15.452
You lie still,
and I'll bring you some soup.


1289
01:38:20.372 --> 01:38:22.333
Well, look at you.

1290
01:38:31.974 --> 01:38:34.014
What is it, Jim?

1291
01:38:34.134 --> 01:38:36.014
Did somebody
do something to you?


1292
01:38:36.134 --> 01:38:38.975
- 'Cause if they did, why...
- Miss Watson died.


1293
01:38:42.855 --> 01:38:44.695
A few weeks ago.

1294
01:38:44.775 --> 01:38:48.376
And, well, she was so ashamed...

1295
01:38:48.456 --> 01:38:53.096
that she was going to sell me away
from my wife and my children, that...


1296
01:38:53.217 --> 01:38:56.417
she set me free
in her will, Huck.


1297
01:38:59.977 --> 01:39:01.818
I'm a free man, Huck.

1298
01:39:05.818 --> 01:39:09.219
I'm a free man.

1299
01:39:22.540 --> 01:39:25.141
Children, come here, please.

1300
01:39:25.261 --> 01:39:27.981
- Mr. Jenkins!
- Good-bye, Adolphus Huckleberry.


1301
01:39:28.061 --> 01:39:29.781
Well, I healed up just fine.

1302
01:39:29.901 --> 01:39:33.022
Mary Jane and her sisters,
along with the Wilks brothers,


1303
01:39:33.102 --> 01:39:36.302
gave me $500 for my troubles
and my chivalrousness.


1304
01:39:36.382 --> 01:39:39.782
But since I got no real use
for money, I gave it all to Jim...


1305
01:39:39.902 --> 01:39:42.663
for his family.

1306
01:39:47.303 --> 01:39:49.544
The Widow Douglas
said she'd adopt me...


1307
01:39:49.664 --> 01:39:52.784
and take me home
and try and civilize me...


1308
01:39:55.664 --> 01:39:58.865
but I don't know
if I could stand it...


1309
01:40:03.185 --> 01:40:05.986
'cause I've been there before.

1310
01:40:10.186 --> 01:40:13.147
Now, where did
Huckleberry go to?


1311
01:40:28.171 --> 01:40:38.171
