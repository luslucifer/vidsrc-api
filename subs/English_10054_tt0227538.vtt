00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:13.874
Carmen, Juni, time for bed.

2
00:01:13.916 --> 00:01:16.502
- Did you brush your teeth?
- I already did.


3
00:01:19.589 --> 00:01:22.008
- Juni, don't forget to brush--
- I am, I am.


4
00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:24.635
All right, all right.

00:01:24.677 --> 00:01:28.139
JUNI: OK, warts. Uhh!

00:01:28.222 --> 00:01:31.642

00:01:36.439 --> 00:01:39.817
Yeah. It's good. It's fine.

9
00:01:39.901 --> 00:01:43.654
OK. Well, lights out.

10
00:01:43.696 --> 00:01:45.615
Bedtime story first.

11
00:01:45.656 --> 00:01:47.450
What story do you want to hear?

12
00:01:47.491 --> 00:01:50.369
"The Two Spies
Who Fell In Love."


13

Hmm. Wow.

14
00:01:52.413 --> 00:01:55.708
I haven't told that one
in a while.


15
00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:58.794
You probably remember that
better than I do.


16
00:01:58.836 --> 00:02:02.298
- Want to hear a story, Juni?
- I'm listening.


17
00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.300
OK.

18
00:02:04.342 --> 00:02:06.302
Once upon a time...

19
00:02:06.344 --> 00:02:08.930
there was a man and a woman.

20
00:02:08.971 --> 00:02:11.223
- And they were both spies.
- Yes.


21
00:02:11.265 --> 00:02:13.225
She from one country,
he from another.


22
00:02:13.267 --> 00:02:16.729
She had a very important mission
assigned to her.


23
00:02:16.771 --> 00:02:19.148
- He was her mission.
- Correct.


24
00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:21.901
Her mission was to take him out.

25
00:02:21.943 --> 00:02:23.819
CARMEN: On a date?

26
00:02:23.861 --> 00:02:27.073
No. Uh, take him--

27
00:02:27.114 --> 00:02:28.699
Oh, you mean...

28
00:02:28.741 --> 00:02:29.951
I shouldn't be telling you this.

29
00:02:29.992 --> 00:02:32.245
- Go on. Go on.
- You have to understand...


30
00:02:32.286 --> 00:02:33.746
these were
dark and confusing times.


31
00:02:33.788 --> 00:02:36.832
An enormous amount of turmoil
between countries.

INGRID: Out off ear...

33
00:02:38.084 --> 00:02:40.336
a new kind of soldier
was created--

00:02:40.378 --> 00:02:42.922
brilliant, brave soldiers...

35
00:02:42.922 --> 00:02:46.926
whose greatest weapons
were their minds.


36
00:02:47.009 --> 00:02:51.389
Those men and women were spies.

37
00:03:10.658 --> 00:03:12.785
They were masters of disguise.

38
00:03:12.827 --> 00:03:15.913
They could sense danger
a mile away...


39
00:03:15.997 --> 00:03:17.582
and through their work...

40
00:03:17.623 --> 00:03:20.585
wars were ended
before they even started.

[Electronic beeping]

42
00:03:24.797 --> 00:03:29.218
The only things spies
were truly afraid of...


43
00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:31.596
were other spies--

44
00:03:31.637 --> 00:03:33.973
enemy spies.

45
00:03:34.015 --> 00:03:36.767
So, sometimes,
one spy's mission...


46
00:03:36.809 --> 00:03:40.146
was to make
the enemy disappear.


47
00:03:40.187 --> 00:03:44.984
He was the assignment
that changed her life...


48
00:03:45.026 --> 00:03:47.153
but when the moment
finally came...


49
00:03:47.194 --> 00:03:48.487
to carry out her mission...

50
00:03:53.284 --> 00:03:55.119
she couldn't do it.

51
00:03:57.371 --> 00:04:00.291
He was different
than she expected.


52
00:04:02.627 --> 00:04:07.298
Sure, he was charming
and intelligent...


53
00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:12.470
but he was
unexpectedly honorable...


54
00:04:12.511 --> 00:04:13.971
and it made her realize...

55
00:04:14.013 --> 00:04:16.223
how years of working
with detached emotion...


56
00:04:16.265 --> 00:04:18.684
had taken its toll.

57
00:04:18.726 --> 00:04:21.520
So they kept contact...

58
00:04:21.562 --> 00:04:24.857
through lunch dates--
very discreet.


59
00:04:24.899 --> 00:04:26.609
After all,
they were on different sides...


60
00:04:26.692 --> 00:04:28.945
so they could never
be seen together.


61

wherever their mutual
travels took them.


63
00:04:32.573 --> 00:04:34.533
And they fell in love...

64
00:04:34.575 --> 00:04:36.661
and they decided
that, together...


65
00:04:36.702 --> 00:04:38.496
they would embark...

66

00:04:48.589 --> 00:04:50.007

she would rather brave...

a thousand deadly missions...

73
00:04:51.759 --> 00:04:53.469
than go through with what
she was about to attempt.


74
00:04:53.511 --> 00:04:55.638
CARMEN: Why is that?

75
00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:57.765
Well, marriage is a mission
so complex...

that only the most courageous
and slightly insane need apply.

There's such an amazing
series of obstacles...

the two most dangerous...

one of them gone.

00:58:08.748 --> 00:58:11.459
CARMEN: Autopilot...failing?

973
00:58:11.542 --> 00:58:14.921
Oh, great.
Another fine Machete product.


974
00:58:14.921 --> 00:58:16.964
Take control.
We have to go to manual.


975
00:58:17.048 --> 00:58:18.883
Now!

976
00:58:18.925 --> 00:58:21.719
CARMEN: You were supposed
to read all the instructions!


977
00:58:23.846 --> 00:58:25.806
You skipped a chapter, meathead.

978
00:58:25.848 --> 00:58:28.309
Better stop calling me names.

979
00:58:28.351 --> 00:58:30.019
Pull up, booger breath !

980
00:58:30.061 --> 00:58:31.771
Stop it or I'll call you names.

981
00:58:31.812 --> 00:58:34.607
CARMEN: Go ahead.
You got nothin' on me, warthog.


982
00:58:34.649 --> 00:58:39.195
Try me...diaper lady.

983
00:58:40.446 --> 00:58:43.407
Aha.
Hope you're wearing one now.


984
00:58:43.449 --> 00:58:46.577
- How long have you known?
- Since forever.


985
00:58:46.619 --> 00:58:49.038
Mom made me swear
not to mention it.


986
00:58:49.080 --> 00:58:51.916
So now we're even !

987
00:58:51.958 --> 00:58:54.168
CARMEN: Oh, now you've done it!

988
00:58:54.210 --> 00:58:57.421
I knew this was gonna happen !

989
00:58:57.463 --> 00:59:00.007
We're gonna crash
if you don't do something !


990
00:59:02.885 --> 00:59:04.971
CARMEN: You did that
on purpose, you kamikaze!


991
00:59:05.012 --> 00:59:07.807
JUNI: But now it's balanced!

992
00:59:07.848 --> 00:59:09.183
Landing gear.

993
00:59:11.769 --> 00:59:14.188
No landing gear.
We're gonna crash !


994
00:59:15.189 --> 00:59:17.567
CARMEN:
Nope. We're gonna drop.


995
00:59:17.608 --> 00:59:19.026
Get your regulator ready.

996
00:59:36.419 --> 00:59:39.839
Com systems check.
Can you hear me?


997
00:59:39.880 --> 00:59:40.881
Yeah.

998
00:59:40.923 --> 00:59:44.760
Let's try that cave over there.

999
00:59:45.923 --> 00:59:48.925
-This must be in.
-You're kidding.


1000
00:59:49.511 --> 00:59:53.330
-It's a cave of sleeping sharks.
-Sharks don't sleep. Wanna bet?


1001
00:59:53.832 --> 00:59:55.517
To design project Donna...

1002
00:59:55.601 --> 01:00:01.173
in depths where the water's salinization
just right, they gather asleep.
I bet they guard the way in.


1003
01:00:01.174 --> 01:00:03.179
It looks like the door over there.

1004
01:00:05.132 --> 01:00:07.057
Wow, Cool. Don't touch it.

1005
01:00:07.058 --> 01:00:13.595
Is it maneater? -No. But you're not a man yet.
They might think, you're an oversize gummy.


1006
01:00:14.539 --> 01:00:16.833
Hey, little sleepy sharky.

1007
01:00:19.920 --> 01:00:25.476
It's asleep, Silly.
-I knew that. -Come on.


1008
01:00:25.802 --> 01:00:28.220
Sweet dream, Sharky.

1009
01:00:35.479 --> 01:00:39.150
Security Camera. I'm gonna distract it.
You wait here.


1010
01:00:39.234 --> 01:00:41.736
-Don't leave me.
-Wait here!


1011
01:00:50.913 --> 01:00:52.457
Say cheese..

1012
01:00:53.584 --> 01:00:55.668
I hope there is
a rest room around here.

1013
01:00:56.628 --> 01:01:02.568
I take a picture of the door and place it
in front of the security camera.


1014
01:01:02.635 --> 01:01:05.290
I have to go pee
and I can't hold it!

1015
01:01:05.300 --> 01:01:09.850
Don't pee! You'll change the water's salinization and
wake up all the sharks.


1016
01:01:09.852 --> 01:01:12.854
I can't help it ...

1017
01:01:13.189 --> 01:01:19.154
No, another camera. Pointing straight at me.
What do I do?


1018
01:01:27.705 --> 01:01:30.500
Why aren't you watching the monitors?

1019
01:01:34.046 --> 01:01:37.299
Get more from your
security if you have to.

1020
01:01:58.616 --> 01:02:01.243
Ah. I can't hold it anymore.

1021
01:02:07.584 --> 01:02:10.628
Almost there...

1022
01:02:10.712 --> 01:02:13.048
Wait a second, Juni. 
Keep holding it!

1023
01:02:17.762 --> 01:02:22.593
-Eh, Carmen...
-Leave me alone. Almost there.


1024
01:02:22.935 --> 01:02:31.314
-Carmen...
-Way to go, Batter Butter.


1025
01:02:33.822 --> 01:02:37.615
-Close the door, Carmen.
-I'm trying. -Faster.


1026
01:02:41.790 --> 01:02:43.749
I'll never pee again.

1027
01:03:03.308 --> 01:03:04.628
A Thumb-thumb.

1028
01:03:04.874 --> 01:03:06.584
A real live--

1029
01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:33.378
What did you do to him?

1030
01:03:33.420 --> 01:03:35.463
Machete's electroshock gumballs.

1031
01:03:35.505 --> 01:03:38.591
It says long lasting.
But I don't trust wrappers.


1032
01:03:49.769 --> 01:03:50.729
Come on.

1033
01:03:58.653 --> 01:04:01.323
CARMEN:
Over here. Juni, come on.


1034
01:04:05.118 --> 01:04:06.953
What are you doing?

1035
01:04:06.995 --> 01:04:08.580
World's smallest cameras.

1036
01:04:08.622 --> 01:04:12.000
I just placed them
all over the main hallways.


1037
01:04:13.168 --> 01:04:15.337
- Sweet.
- Thanks.


1038
01:04:15.378 --> 01:04:20.133
Thumb-thumbs and Fooglies
coming up the south hall.


1039
01:04:22.844 --> 01:04:24.304
Got an idea?

1040
01:04:24.346 --> 01:04:25.930
Yeah.

1041
01:04:38.860 --> 01:04:40.528
JUNI: Agent Donnagon?

1042
01:04:40.570 --> 01:04:44.407
[Speaking backwards]

1043
01:04:44.449 --> 01:04:46.701
Where's my mom and dad?

1044
01:04:48.286 --> 01:04:50.830
[Speaking backwards]

1045
01:04:50.872 --> 01:04:52.123
Thanks.

1046
01:04:54.876 --> 01:04:57.337
- I got it.
- What'd he say?


1047
01:04:57.379 --> 01:04:58.338
I'll play it backwards.

1048
01:04:58.380 --> 01:05:00.632
DONNAGON:
They're in the dungeon. Hurry.


1049
01:05:00.674 --> 01:05:02.133
See if they know
where the Brain room is.


1050
01:05:06.012 --> 01:05:07.430
Uh-oh.

1051
01:05:07.472 --> 01:05:09.849
Thumb-thumbs--everywhere.

1052
01:05:09.891 --> 01:05:11.351
Let's see if they like bubbles.

1053
01:05:23.697 --> 01:05:26.616
We'll be back for you,
fellow agents.


1054
01:05:26.658 --> 01:05:28.159
Sknaht!

1055
01:05:28.243 --> 01:05:30.120
[Jabbering excitedly]

1056
01:05:30.161 --> 01:05:32.205
MINION ON P.A.:
All robots please report...


1057
01:05:32.247 --> 01:05:36.209
to docking bays four, five,
and six for immediate loading.


1058
01:05:36.293 --> 01:05:38.753
This is the ventilator shaft
here.


1059
01:05:38.795 --> 01:05:41.923
CARMEN: But the dungeon's on
the other side of the castle.


1060
01:05:41.965 --> 01:05:44.676
How do we get there undetected?

1061
01:05:56.730 --> 01:05:58.440
[Whispering] I think
they've gotten smarter...


1062
01:05:58.481 --> 01:05:59.691
since the last time we met.

1063
01:05:59.733 --> 01:06:01.109
Intruder.

1064
01:06:01.151 --> 01:06:03.945
ALL: Intruder, intruder,
intruder, intruder...


1065
01:06:04.029 --> 01:06:06.781
intruder, intruder,
intruder, intruder...


1066
01:06:13.204 --> 01:06:15.749
- Can you make it?
- I think so.


1067
01:06:15.790 --> 01:06:18.251
Come on. Come on !

1068
01:06:19.252 --> 01:06:22.881
- Carmen !
- Find Mom and Dad !


1069
01:06:33.516 --> 01:06:34.976
I hope this leads
to the dungeon.


1070
01:06:43.318 --> 01:06:44.527
FLOOP: You there.

1071
01:06:44.569 --> 01:06:48.615
What's that on your hands?

1072
01:06:52.077 --> 01:06:54.454
FLOOP: Warts, aren't they?

1073
01:06:54.496 --> 01:06:55.997
Oh, great.

1074
01:06:56.039 --> 01:06:59.125
From sweaty hands sprout warts.

1075
01:06:59.167 --> 01:07:02.128
FLOOP: Do you know why
you have sweaty hands?


1076
01:07:02.170 --> 01:07:04.297
From being scared all the time.

1077
01:07:06.675 --> 01:07:09.094
You don't look
very scared to me.


1078
01:07:09.177 --> 01:07:12.681
That's because I'm mad.
You kidnapped my parents...


1079
01:07:12.764 --> 01:07:16.851
made psycho robot children,
and swallowed up my sister.


1080
01:07:16.893 --> 01:07:18.687
But I didn't want any of that.

1081
01:07:18.728 --> 01:07:22.607
- I thought Floop was a genius.
- You did?


1082
01:07:27.112 --> 01:07:29.322
You watch my show?

1083
01:07:29.364 --> 01:07:31.116
More than you know.

1084
01:07:34.953 --> 01:07:37.289
Alexander Minion.

1085
01:07:37.330 --> 01:07:39.499
Agent Cortez.

1086
01:07:39.541 --> 01:07:41.501
Wonderful to see you again.

1087
01:07:41.543 --> 01:07:44.254
- You know him?
- Yeah.


1088
01:07:44.337 --> 01:07:46.256
He was on
the Third Brain Project...


1089
01:07:46.339 --> 01:07:48.758
until I noticed
he was trying to inject...


1090
01:07:48.800 --> 01:07:51.594
his own ideas into the system.

1091
01:07:51.636 --> 01:07:53.346
I turned him in.

1092
01:07:53.388 --> 01:07:55.932
He was thrown out of the OSS.

1093
01:07:55.974 --> 01:08:00.103
MINION: I'm afraid I'm not
nearly the artist Floop is.


1094
01:08:00.145 --> 01:08:01.771
But not to worry.

1095
01:08:01.813 --> 01:08:04.441
I have something else in mind.

1096
01:08:08.236 --> 01:08:10.905
What do you think you're going
to accomplish by doing this?


1097
01:08:10.947 --> 01:08:12.657
Well, you see, Mrs. Cortez...

1098
01:08:12.699 --> 01:08:16.077
I've always been methodical,
goal oriented.


1099
01:08:16.119 --> 01:08:17.537
Psychotically so.

1100
01:08:17.579 --> 01:08:20.040
I'm not afraid of you, Alex.

1101
01:08:20.123 --> 01:08:22.208
So I think it's refreshing...

1102
01:08:22.250 --> 01:08:25.086
to every once in a while...

1103
01:08:25.086 --> 01:08:27.589
have some fun.

1104
01:08:27.631 --> 01:08:29.174
MINION: Oh, and don't worry
about your little brats.


1105
01:08:29.215 --> 01:08:31.259
They'll still be able
to see you.


1106
01:08:31.301 --> 01:08:34.638
Every weekday morning
between 7:30 and 8:00.


1107
01:08:40.435 --> 01:08:42.395
CARMEN: Aah !

1108
01:08:42.437 --> 01:08:43.980
Uhh !

1109
01:08:48.985 --> 01:08:51.655
[Clanking and whirring]

1110
01:09:07.087 --> 01:09:10.423
I trust this time Floop
will have a success to show us.


1111
01:09:10.465 --> 01:09:14.052
The Fabulous Floop is away
on other business, sir.


1112
01:09:14.094 --> 01:09:15.887
Your army is complete.

1113
01:09:15.929 --> 01:09:18.932
The ultimate destructive force
is now within your grasp.


1114
01:09:18.974 --> 01:09:22.060
I'll believe that when I see it.

1115
01:09:26.106 --> 01:09:28.817
Welcome back, Ms. Gradenko.

1116
01:09:30.610 --> 01:09:33.405
It's good to be back, Alex.

1117
01:09:33.446 --> 01:09:35.365
Let's never have children.

1118
01:09:35.407 --> 01:09:39.202
- So Minion is the evil one.
- Yes.


1119
01:09:39.244 --> 01:09:41.204
FLOOP: But I will be blamed.

1120
01:09:41.246 --> 01:09:43.248
You have every reason
to be disappointed in me.


1121
01:09:43.290 --> 01:09:46.251
So what would you do if you
could shut this thing off...


1122
01:09:46.293 --> 01:09:47.752
and get out of here?

1123
01:09:47.794 --> 01:09:50.547
It's impossible. It can only be
turned off from the outside.


1124
01:09:52.048 --> 01:09:53.216
Just suppose.

1125
01:09:53.258 --> 01:09:55.760
I'd stop Minion.

1126
01:09:55.844 --> 01:09:58.138

We don't want you
to see this, OK?

[Punching, socking]

1285
01:19:36.424 --> 01:19:37.717
Whoa !

1286
01:19:46.935 --> 01:19:48.812
INGRID: Any ideas?

1287
01:19:48.853 --> 01:19:50.397
I'm thinking. I'm thinking.

1288
01:19:50.438 --> 01:19:53.775
Wonderful. Wonderful.

1289
01:19:53.817 --> 01:19:57.779
- Carmen?
- No. Juni?


1290
01:19:57.862 --> 01:20:00.073
GREGORIO: I've thought it out.
Yes. I've thought it out.


1291
01:20:00.156 --> 01:20:02.534
I think I got it.

1292
01:20:02.575 --> 01:20:04.119
INGRID: Tell us.

1293
01:20:04.202 --> 01:20:06.162
Family, here's what we do.

1294
01:20:06.204 --> 01:20:08.081
I'll take the hundred
on the right.


1295
01:20:08.123 --> 01:20:10.083
Ingrid, you take the hundred
on the left.


1296
01:20:10.125 --> 01:20:12.294
Carmen, hundred center-left.

Juni, center-right.

1298

It'll work. It'll work.

JUNI: That's 500 total, Dad.

1300
01:20:18.717 --> 01:20:21.052
We need one more person.

1301
01:20:28.226 --> 01:20:31.980
- Isador.
- Hello, little brother.


1302
01:20:34.649 --> 01:20:36.067
Children !

1303
01:20:39.988 --> 01:20:41.906
Tear them limb from limb.

1304
01:20:43.908 --> 01:20:45.910
Good. How? How?

1305
01:20:45.952 --> 01:20:48.580
I'll have to teach them.
Shaped by environment, man...

[Gasps] Of course!

- Haaah !

Tell them to put me down !

MINION: Their mind
is a mirror now, sir.


1311
01:21:13.396 --> 01:21:18.276
Anything we tell them goes
in one ear and out the other!


1312
01:21:21.321 --> 01:21:23.531
Why did you come back?

1313
01:21:25.909 --> 01:21:28.203
For the same reason I left.

1314
01:21:29.412 --> 01:21:32.082
You know what?

1315
01:21:32.123 --> 01:21:34.542
I don't remember that reason.

1316
01:21:36.044 --> 01:21:37.879
Neither do I.

It's OK, it's OK.

It's OK. Let it go. Let it go.

He's emotional. Latinos.

OK. That's it.

That's it. That's it.

1324
01:21:54.229 --> 01:21:56.690
So, what did you teach them?

1325
01:21:56.731 --> 01:21:59.609
It's not what
I can teach the children...


1326
01:21:59.651 --> 01:22:02.487
but what you taught me.

1327
01:22:02.529 --> 01:22:04.739
You won today, Juni,
and not because...


1328
01:22:04.781 --> 01:22:06.741
you were the biggest
or the strongest...


1329
01:22:06.783 --> 01:22:10.954
but because you were
pure of heart and of mind.


1330
01:22:12.497 --> 01:22:14.916
And now the robots
have learned that as well.


1331
01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:17.252
Thank you.

1332
01:22:17.294 --> 01:22:21.047
We went on the old-fashioned
adventure I always wanted.


1333
01:22:21.089 --> 01:22:23.550
And we didn't do
one thing right.


1334
01:22:23.591 --> 01:22:25.552
Nope.

1335
01:22:25.593 --> 01:22:29.097
We did two things right.

1336

There is something
that we have to tell you.

who've done
some incredible good deeds.


1345

It seems that a day
doesn't go by...


1346
01:23:06.301 --> 01:23:07.969
that another amazing child...

performs some outstanding
act of charity...


1348
01:23:10.263 --> 01:23:11.931
or community service.

Who are these children...

1350
01:23:13.642 --> 01:23:16.269
and why are they so good
at being good?


1351

I gotta have
the business section.

I thought
you closed down your shop.

Yeah, but I gotta keep tabs
on free enterprise.

has come up in the Far East.

I need you on it right away.

Oh, sorry, Devlin.

as a family yet, so...

come out of retirement...


1368

or not is a decision
that is up to us...

Uh, Gregorio, Ingrid,
I wasn't talking to you.


1371
01:24:13.284 --> 01:24:14.995
Ey?

1372

No, this assignment
is for Carmen and Juni.

They're the ones we need.

field agents...

that this organization's
ever seen.

So what do you say, kids?

1377
01:24:24.754 --> 01:24:26.589
You up for it?

1378

Devlin,
if you want the Cortezes...


1379
01:24:28.174 --> 01:24:30.427
you take all the Cortezes...

1380
01:24:30.468 --> 01:24:33.555
even Mom and Dad.

1381
01:24:33.596 --> 01:24:37.434
From now on, whatever we do,
we do together.


1382
01:24:39.811 --> 01:24:41.855
Spy work...that's easy.

1383

Keeping a family together...

1384
01:24:44.399 --> 01:24:46.526
that's difficult.

1385
01:24:46.568 --> 01:24:50.113
And that's the mission
worth fighting for.
