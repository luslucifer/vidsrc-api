Mom? Why didn't you wake me up?

[sighs]

7
00:00:31.655 --> 00:00:33.063
Ugh! I'm going to be so late.

8
00:00:33.157 --> 00:00:34.472
I don't have any clean socks!

9
00:00:34.491 --> 00:00:35.657
You know what,

10
00:00:35.884 --> 00:00:36.900
I asked you if you wanted me
to wake you up,


11
00:00:37.052 --> 00:00:37.809
but you said,
"No. Mom, you've hovering.


12
00:00:37.903 --> 00:00:39.143
I'm 14 now.
I'm not a baby.


13
00:00:39.237 --> 00:00:40.236
I can handle it on my own."

14
00:00:40.331 --> 00:00:41.646
I can still hear you!

15
00:00:41.665 --> 00:00:44.057
[Zenya] Yeah, well,
I'm not trying to be quiet!


16
00:00:44.076 --> 00:00:44.891
I don't have any clean socks,
I'm gonna miss my bus!


17
00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:46.226
Did you do the laundry?

18
00:00:46.244 --> 00:00:47.243
I suggest the next time

19
00:00:47.396 --> 00:00:48.745
you can't see the carpet
in your bedroom,


20
00:00:48.839 --> 00:00:50.005
you do your own clothes.

21
00:00:50.232 --> 00:00:52.916
Okay, well, a simple "no"
would have been fine!


22
00:00:53.068 --> 00:00:55.085
I just bought these boots!
I need socks!


23
00:00:55.179 --> 00:00:57.179
Did you pack a lunch?

24
00:00:57.406 --> 00:00:58.680
No, I didn't have time.
I'm gonna miss the bus!


25
00:00:58.907 --> 00:01:00.090
I love you.

26
00:01:00.242 --> 00:01:02.476
Wait! Oh, just hold on!

27
00:01:04.079 --> 00:01:06.188
Your socks!

28
00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:11.109
Wait. Wait!

Great.

Ow.

32
00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:29.452
Stupid new boots.

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:50.640
Abby?

35
00:01:50.792 --> 00:01:51.641
What are you doing?

36
00:01:51.735 --> 00:01:52.642
Hey, Mr. Bryant.

37
00:01:52.736 --> 00:01:53.643
Late for school.

38
00:01:53.737 --> 00:01:54.986
I'm going right past it.

39
00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:57.555
Thank you.

40
00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:58.648
How's your dad?

41
00:01:58.742 --> 00:02:00.150
I haven't seen him in a while.

42
00:02:00.244 --> 00:02:01.392
He lives in Connecticut.

43
00:02:01.412 --> 00:02:03.561
Ah. Hitchhiking?

44
00:02:03.655 --> 00:02:06.322
My friends and I
do it sometimes.


45
00:02:06.475 --> 00:02:08.917
I guess it's Conway, huh?

46
00:02:09.068 --> 00:02:10.919
Everybody knows everybody.

47
00:02:15.592 --> 00:02:17.150
Hey, Abby, uh,

48
00:02:17.169 --> 00:02:20.487
so I was thinking maybe hitting
the fall festival tonight.


49
00:02:20.505 --> 00:02:22.914
Don't know if, like,
everyone's going, so...


50
00:02:23.008 --> 00:02:24.674
All the more reason not to.

51
00:02:24.768 --> 00:02:26.660
[chuckles awkwardly]
Oh, yeah, I know, right?


52
00:02:26.678 --> 00:02:28.344
Still could be fun,
though, you know.


53
00:02:28.497 --> 00:02:29.496
Liz too, obviously.

54
00:02:29.589 --> 00:02:31.681
Brenda Jacobs's parents
are out of town.


55
00:02:31.775 --> 00:02:32.999
Party tonight.

56
00:02:33.092 --> 00:02:34.517
And... Neal's gonna be there.

57
00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:37.762
Neal, by definition,
is super-hot, so...


58
00:02:37.856 --> 00:02:40.173
I'll have to check with my mom.

59
00:02:40.192 --> 00:02:41.341
Just tell her
you're going to the festival.


60
00:02:41.359 --> 00:02:43.100
I'm not gonna lie to her.

61
00:02:43.195 --> 00:02:44.844
- But then she'll say no.
- I'll ask, okay?


62
00:02:44.863 --> 00:02:46.012
Ow.

63
00:02:46.031 --> 00:02:47.514
What the hell, Miranda?

64
00:02:47.532 --> 00:02:49.458
Stop talking to Darren.

65
00:02:49.609 --> 00:02:51.534
"A," I can talk
to whoever I want.


66
00:02:51.628 --> 00:02:53.353
"B," Darren's a jerk.

67
00:02:53.446 --> 00:02:55.630
You can have him.
It's a perfect match.


68
00:02:57.192 --> 00:02:58.967
Well played.

69
00:03:02.197 --> 00:03:03.138
Hey, Abby, sweetie!

70
00:03:04.366 --> 00:03:06.032
Mom?

71
00:03:06.125 --> 00:03:07.200
Yeah. I was on my lunch break.

72
00:03:07.293 --> 00:03:08.551
How are your feet holding up?

73
00:03:08.704 --> 00:03:10.729
They're killing me.

74
00:03:13.041 --> 00:03:15.058
Thank you.
This is really sweet.


75
00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:16.968
I know.
That's what moms are for.


76
00:03:17.062 --> 00:03:18.545
I've got to go.

77

- Okay, love you.
- Mom!

See you after school.

[Liz] Well, my parents
are totally cool about it


82
00:03:30.483 --> 00:03:32.559
and Tammy said
she can pick you up.


83
00:03:32.577 --> 00:03:33.985
[Abby] Cool. I'll text you
when I get home.


84
00:03:34.004 --> 00:03:35.912
Oh, I've got to go.
I'll see you guys later.

you could use a ride.

Yeah.

Abby.

99
00:04:30.302 --> 00:04:31.801
You can drop me off
at Grant's Grill.


100
00:04:31.895 --> 00:04:33.645
It's just a few miles.

101
00:04:35.882 --> 00:04:37.807
Do you know where that is?

102
00:04:37.901 --> 00:04:40.126
I can't say that I do.

103
00:04:40.219 --> 00:04:41.719
You've never been
to Grant's Grill?


104
00:04:41.738 --> 00:04:44.406
It's a... it's a left
at the next light there.


105
00:04:47.319 --> 00:04:48.577
It's left here.

106
00:04:48.804 --> 00:04:49.894
Yeah, uh...

107
00:04:49.988 --> 00:04:52.229
do you mind if I stop
at the store real quick?


108
00:04:52.324 --> 00:04:54.991
Sorry, I just
don't want to backtrack.

Okay.

110

I appreciate the ride,
but, um, I can walk from here.

Scream or try and get out again,

I'll blow your brains out

I never call on you.

Forgive me.

00:08:33.862 --> 00:08:35.619
So please don't go.

175

Please, don't leave me alone.

176

You don't need to pray, Abby.

So I know
this isn't a great situation...


180
00:08:56.901 --> 00:09:00.553
but I am gonna figure out
something more comfortable.


181
00:09:00.646 --> 00:09:02.163
Why do I need something
more comfortable

if you're gonna let me go?

183

that I'm really good with guns.

185
00:09:10.489 --> 00:09:14.067
I, uh, served in the Army.

186
00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:15.993
I've served in a lot of battles.

187
00:09:16.087 --> 00:09:18.588
Won a lot of medals.

188
00:09:18.682 --> 00:09:20.164
A lot of heroic stuff

another time.

Old war buddies.

193
00:09:30.768 --> 00:09:33.252

try to get away

195
00:09:34.698 --> 00:09:37.106

- Nobody's seen her.

- She's going to come

and you're going to hug her.

yell at her

and tell her never to do
something like this ever again.

00:14:34.405 --> 00:14:36.722
There has never been
a parent, ever,

would run away.

Abby wouldn't have run away.

332
00:14:40.895 --> 00:14:42.244
Is there anyone else
in her life?


333
00:14:42.338 --> 00:14:44.063
Maybe somebody online?

334
00:14:44.081 --> 00:14:46.399
Anything that could explain
why she hasn't come home?


335
00:14:46.417 --> 00:14:48.659
No. Abby doesn't keep
these kind of secrets from me.


336
00:14:48.753 --> 00:14:50.661
Okay? She...
She always calls me back.

[voice rising] Something

It's her birthday in a few days,

345

some money to...

She would have
taken that with her

if she had run away.

350
00:15:15.872 --> 00:15:16.779
She would've packed
some clothes.

Oh, my God, she has new...

354
00:15:21.269 --> 00:15:24.378

I brought her socks to school,


355
00:15:24.605 --> 00:15:26.380
but she said that her feet
were still hurting her


356
00:15:26.607 --> 00:15:28.774
and that...

357
00:15:28.793 --> 00:15:30.635
Has Abby ever hitchhiked?

358
00:15:31.870 --> 00:15:33.779
No. No, I tell her not to.

359
00:15:33.798 --> 00:15:34.797
She knows not to,

360
00:15:34.891 --> 00:15:36.140

361
00:15:39.287 --> 00:15:40.353
Oh, my God.

362
00:15:41.564 --> 00:15:44.482
[sobbing] Maybe her feet hurt.

[voice rising] Well, you could
at least talk to me, Abby.

Okay. Stop, please.

I'm sorry.

What do you want to talk about?

508
00:22:24.525 --> 00:22:26.783
You said you were
having a bad time at work.


509
00:22:26.802 --> 00:22:27.968
What happened?

510
00:22:29.380 --> 00:22:31.546
I don't know!
A lot of things.


511
00:22:31.641 --> 00:22:32.640
Like what?

512
00:22:34.793 --> 00:22:37.645
Am I supposed to believe
that you actually care?


513
00:22:37.872 --> 00:22:40.814
It must've been
something terrible,


514
00:22:41.041 --> 00:22:42.983
because you don't
seem like a bad person.


515
00:22:44.712 --> 00:22:45.969
Well...

516
00:22:45.988 --> 00:22:47.613
it's not just one thing.

517
00:22:49.808 --> 00:22:51.825
It's a lot of things, you know?

518
00:22:52.052 --> 00:22:54.403
A lot of trouble at work
with the guys.

I don't know.
People can be pretty mean, Abby.


521
00:22:58.909 --> 00:23:00.834
I don't even think
they know my name.


522
00:23:00.986 --> 00:23:03.395
They judge me.

523
00:23:03.414 --> 00:23:06.322
I mean, I'm sure that you think
I'm pretty mean after all this,


524
00:23:06.342 --> 00:23:07.341
but...

525
00:23:07.492 --> 00:23:09.584
really, Abby,
once you get to know me,


526
00:23:09.737 --> 00:23:11.345
you'll see
that I'm not that way.


527
00:23:12.740 --> 00:23:14.923
I can be a good friend.

528
00:23:15.075 --> 00:23:17.834
I can love someone.

529
00:23:17.928 --> 00:23:20.762
And I can share things.

530
00:23:20.915 --> 00:23:23.649
What about your militia friends?

531
00:23:25.753 --> 00:23:27.861
They don't take me
too seriously, either.


532
00:23:29.865 --> 00:23:32.424
Abby...

533
00:23:32.443 --> 00:23:35.594
it's hard to find nice friends
in this world.


534
00:23:35.612 --> 00:23:37.779
Thanks.

535
00:23:37.932 --> 00:23:39.540
For what?

536
00:23:39.691 --> 00:23:40.708
For listening.

537
00:23:44.455 --> 00:23:45.671
I have something for you.

538
00:23:55.115 --> 00:23:56.798
So, Abby...

539
00:23:56.951 --> 00:24:00.060
I know that shock collars
are really only for dogs,


540
00:24:00.287 --> 00:24:02.396
and I don't
think of you that way...


541
00:24:02.547 --> 00:24:04.473
Honestly, I don't...

542
00:24:04.625 --> 00:24:06.382
But if we use this,

543
00:24:06.402 --> 00:24:08.861
you don't have to wear
a gag on your mouth.


544

Listen.

545

This thing
is really only activated


546
00:24:14.985 --> 00:24:18.487
if you stimulate
the vocal cords. Okay?


547
00:24:18.639 --> 00:24:23.976
As long as you don't scream
or make a lot of loud noises...


548
00:24:24.069 --> 00:24:25.827
you shouldn't have a problem.

549
00:24:25.980 --> 00:24:28.313
Okay?

550
00:24:28.332 --> 00:24:29.815

Abby, you didn't tell me
you had a birthday.


555

It's on October 12th.

that you were abducted

656
00:30:13.176 --> 00:30:14.768
I'm looking for you.

657
00:30:14.919 --> 00:30:16.845
Don't you give up, okay?

658
00:30:16.997 --> 00:30:19.606
Because I am going to find you.

659
00:30:19.757 --> 00:30:22.067
I promise.

660
00:30:30.694 --> 00:30:32.452
[Zenya] A lie-detector test?

661
00:30:32.679 --> 00:30:34.937
Do you really think
I did something to Abby?


662
00:30:34.957 --> 00:30:36.772
This is
a multi-agency investigation.


663
00:30:36.792 --> 00:30:37.624
It's...

664
00:30:37.775 --> 00:30:39.108
It's bullshit!

665
00:30:39.128 --> 00:30:41.795
She has been gone for a month!

666
00:30:43.357 --> 00:30:45.523
What is it that you said to me,
Detective Dunlap?


667
00:30:45.542 --> 00:30:49.210
Um, "90% of the time,
when we find these kids,


668
00:30:49.363 --> 00:30:52.714
we find them within two weeks"?

669
00:30:52.866 --> 00:30:55.216
Well, it's been four!
Where the hell is she?


670
00:30:55.369 --> 00:30:57.460
I wish she was a runaway,
Mrs. Hernandez,


671
00:30:57.479 --> 00:30:58.812
because, by now,

672
00:30:58.963 --> 00:31:00.872
chances are
we would've found her.


673
00:31:00.891 --> 00:31:04.317
Then why isn't the FBI
convinced that she was abducted?


674
00:31:04.469 --> 00:31:06.211
[Dunlap] They have to keep
all possibilities open.


675
00:31:06.229 --> 00:31:07.896
It's how they do their job.

676
00:31:08.048 --> 00:31:09.823
Oh, really?

677
00:31:10.050 --> 00:31:11.825
Well, if they were
any good at their job,


678
00:31:11.976 --> 00:31:13.994
my daughter would be home.

679
00:31:14.145 --> 00:31:18.314
[Sadler] Whoever took her
is very smart.


680
00:31:18.408 --> 00:31:19.741
The FBI, the State Police

681
00:31:19.893 --> 00:31:21.668
are just as frustrated
as we are,


682
00:31:21.819 --> 00:31:22.727
so bear with them.

683
00:31:22.746 --> 00:31:25.413
Co-operate.

684
00:31:25.565 --> 00:31:27.399
We need them on our side.

685
00:31:27.417 --> 00:31:29.634
[♪♪]

686
00:31:32.239 --> 00:31:34.181
[Tess] Do they really think
you're going to fail


687
00:31:34.332 --> 00:31:35.682
a lie-detector test?

688
00:31:35.833 --> 00:31:37.017
I don't know.

689
00:31:37.168 --> 00:31:39.260
I swear, sometimes I think
that's what they want.


690
00:31:39.413 --> 00:31:42.189
I mean, not the police...
The FBI.


691
00:31:42.340 --> 00:31:44.082
Some of them are...
They're just...


692
00:31:44.100 --> 00:31:45.025
they're so great,

693
00:31:45.252 --> 00:31:46.842
and they're so determined
to find her,


694
00:31:46.937 --> 00:31:48.010
and then there's others

695
00:31:48.104 --> 00:31:49.529
that they just want
any kind of answer.


696
00:31:49.756 --> 00:31:53.516
So they can cover their ass
for not being able to find her.


697
00:31:53.535 --> 00:31:55.760
You know, Tess, I was...

698
00:31:55.779 --> 00:31:58.038
I was horrified at the idea

699
00:31:58.189 --> 00:32:00.598
that she would've run away

700
00:32:00.617 --> 00:32:03.101
or was meeting someone online,
that she got pregnant,


701
00:32:03.119 --> 00:32:04.878
and now I just...

702
00:32:05.105 --> 00:32:07.196
I wish to God
that was the case so that...


703
00:32:07.216 --> 00:32:09.883
at least I would know
that she was alive.


704
00:32:11.386 --> 00:32:14.112
We're doing everything we can.

705
00:32:14.130 --> 00:32:17.799
We're going to find her.
She's going to come home.


706
00:32:17.951 --> 00:32:20.060
We are gonna find her, right?

707
00:32:21.304 --> 00:32:23.396
[♪♪]

[♪♪]

709
00:32:44.494 --> 00:32:46.902
Then, how do you explain
the missing airplane,


710
00:32:46.997 --> 00:32:48.904
if it was a missile?

711
00:32:48.924 --> 00:32:50.498
It's being held.

712
00:32:50.650 --> 00:32:52.667
And all the passengers?

713
00:32:52.819 --> 00:32:55.320
It's deeper than
you could possibly imagine.


714
00:32:55.338 --> 00:32:57.489
Every President knows about it.

715
00:32:57.507 --> 00:33:00.008
What about the messages
the passengers left


716
00:33:00.160 --> 00:33:01.676
when they were about
to hit the Pentagon?


717
00:33:01.770 --> 00:33:02.677
Those were faked.

718
00:33:02.771 --> 00:33:05.087
Get outta here.

719
00:33:05.107 --> 00:33:06.940
My uncle died on 9/11.

720

I can't work around him anymore.
He's nuts.

00:33:15.859 --> 00:33:17.742

722
00:33:19.029 --> 00:33:19.953

Yeah, hey, listen, uh,
you're a good worker.


726
00:33:30.190 --> 00:33:31.539
I like having you on the floor,

727
00:33:31.633 --> 00:33:34.116
but you've got to stop with
some of this conspiracy crap.


728
00:33:34.210 --> 00:33:36.861
What are you talking about?
I'm just having a conversation.

outside the workplace, okay?

00:33:40.625 --> 00:33:42.142

are getting tired

of hearing it in the lunchroom.

733
00:33:43.720 --> 00:33:45.703
Truth isn't a conspiracy.

734
00:33:45.797 --> 00:33:47.314
Just turn it down a notch, okay?

The problem is, Abby,

745
00:34:24.519 --> 00:34:27.354
is that they're all new.

746
00:34:27.505 --> 00:34:29.914
They haven't stopped
looking for you.


747
00:34:29.933 --> 00:34:33.342
And we need them
to stop looking, okay?


748
00:34:33.362 --> 00:34:35.195
So...

749
00:34:35.346 --> 00:34:36.921
what I want you to do

750
00:34:36.940 --> 00:34:39.515
is write a letter to your mom.

751
00:34:39.609 --> 00:34:41.926
Tell her that you're okay

752
00:34:42.019 --> 00:34:45.096
and you're sorry
for running away.


753
00:34:45.115 --> 00:34:46.873
I think that'll
make her happy, you know?


754
00:34:47.024 --> 00:34:49.358
I mean, let's be honest.

755
00:34:49.378 --> 00:34:51.102
At this point,

756
00:34:51.121 --> 00:34:52.670
she doesn't even know
if you're still alive.


757
00:34:59.054 --> 00:35:02.614
Okay.

758
00:35:02.632 --> 00:35:04.224
Well, go ahead.

759
00:35:05.894 --> 00:35:07.042
Oh, and, Abby,

760
00:35:07.062 --> 00:35:10.188
I'm gonna read every word
of that letter.

I mean, I am taking
kind of a risk here, you know?


763
00:35:22.059 --> 00:35:24.059
They are gonna
look at that letter

under a total microscope.

765

But if
they don't stop looking...

I can't give you
any more freedoms.

But her writing style
is different.


855
00:40:08.697 --> 00:40:09.529
She writes
more lyrical than this.

"Dear Mom,

857

First of all,

I want you to know
that I'm okay.

I'm doing fine and I'm healthy.

I know this has probably
been scary

and hard on you,
and Dad as well.

I miss all of you terribly...

I'm so sorry.

I can't tell you where I am,

but I will soon, I promise.

867
00:40:30.109 --> 00:40:31.700
Nor can I tell you why.

Not yet.

Please know I love you,
and I'll see you again."


870
00:40:35.798 --> 00:40:37.056
Someone made her write that.

871
00:40:37.283 --> 00:40:39.726
More than likely, yes,
but there's no way to be sure.


872
00:40:39.953 --> 00:40:41.302
What?

873
00:40:41.454 --> 00:40:44.731
I-I-I'm sorry, are we back
to her being a runaway again?

Mrs....

875
00:40:45.959 --> 00:40:47.141
Is that what
you're saying to me?


876
00:40:47.293 --> 00:40:48.960
Mrs. Hernandez, we can
show you a dozen cases


877
00:40:49.053 --> 00:40:49.810
where a child would just dis...

878

Why?

00:40:51.055 --> 00:40:53.722
Please tell me
why she would run away.


880
00:40:53.742 --> 00:40:56.225
Pregnant, attention, bullying...

881
00:40:56.244 --> 00:40:57.893
I've got a long list.

882
00:40:57.912 --> 00:40:59.061
No, no, no, no!
We've been through this.


883
00:40:59.155 --> 00:41:00.246
I know what I think it is.

884
00:41:00.397 --> 00:41:02.064
It's that you don't want
to accept the truth


885
00:41:02.083 --> 00:41:04.083
that my daughter was kidnapped

886
00:41:04.235 --> 00:41:06.401
because you are not any good
at doing what you do!


887
00:41:06.496 --> 00:41:08.312
- Zenya!
- What?


888
00:41:08.331 --> 00:41:09.255
Please.

889
00:41:09.406 --> 00:41:10.405
It's okay.

890
00:41:10.425 --> 00:41:11.665
It's been two months,

891
00:41:11.760 --> 00:41:15.077
and her face has been seen
all over the country,


892
00:41:15.096 --> 00:41:16.745
and this is the only lead
that we have.


893
00:41:16.765 --> 00:41:19.840
We're doing our very best,
Mrs. Hernandez,


894
00:41:19.993 --> 00:41:21.601
but you need to prepare yourself

895
00:41:21.752 --> 00:41:22.994
for a different truth

896
00:41:23.087 --> 00:41:25.104
based on the leads that we get.

897
00:41:26.682 --> 00:41:29.091
Okay. Okay.

898
00:41:29.110 --> 00:41:31.836
What about a press conference?

899
00:41:31.854 --> 00:41:34.355
Just to let people know
that she's still alive?


900
00:41:34.507 --> 00:41:35.856
It would keep her in the news.

901
00:41:36.009 --> 00:41:37.024
That's not a good idea.

902
00:41:37.118 --> 00:41:39.510
If we go public
that we received a letter,


903
00:41:39.529 --> 00:41:41.436
it could actually
hinder our investigation.


904
00:41:41.456 --> 00:41:43.197
At least not until

905
00:41:43.349 --> 00:41:45.533
we've exhausted all efforts
to trace its origin.


906
00:41:45.685 --> 00:41:46.459
She's right.

907
00:41:48.129 --> 00:41:49.962
So that's just it?

908
00:41:50.189 --> 00:41:53.282
Don't understand me,
Mrs. Hernandez.


909
00:41:53.301 --> 00:41:54.708
We won't stop looking for her.

910
00:41:54.861 --> 00:41:57.878
This case keeps me up at night.

911
00:41:58.031 --> 00:42:00.881
14-year-old girls don't
just disappear without a trace.


912
00:42:01.034 --> 00:42:02.883
No, no. They don't.

913
00:42:03.036 --> 00:42:04.869
There's always something.

914
00:42:04.962 --> 00:42:06.646
We can only work
with what we have.


915
00:42:06.797 --> 00:42:08.314
I'm sorry.

916
00:42:09.484 --> 00:42:11.392
Remember...

917
00:42:11.486 --> 00:42:14.803
I told you that
I was working on something else?


918
00:42:14.823 --> 00:42:18.140
Okay, stay here.

919
00:42:18.159 --> 00:42:20.217
I think you're really
gonna like this.

921
00:42:25.892 --> 00:42:28.059
There we go.

[door thuds]

923
00:42:30.396 --> 00:42:31.245
Well, it's not the Taj Mahal,

924
00:42:31.339 --> 00:42:34.340
but you'll have
more room in here.


925
00:42:34.491 --> 00:42:37.301
I've lined it
with three-inch foam...


926
00:42:38.571 --> 00:42:41.663
so no one's
gonna be able to hear you.


927
00:42:41.683 --> 00:42:43.832
And you still have to wear
the shock collar.


928
00:42:43.852 --> 00:42:46.853
Can't be too careful.

929
00:42:47.004 --> 00:42:49.671
But, Abby,
I did put a hose in here...


930
00:42:49.691 --> 00:42:51.691
so you'll have some fresh air.

931
00:42:51.842 --> 00:42:54.919
This is really great, Felix.
Thank you.

No, I really mean it.

934
00:43:00.426 --> 00:43:02.109
Yeah, well, we'll do
some more things in here


935
00:43:02.261 --> 00:43:03.685
that'll make it feel like home.

936
00:43:03.705 --> 00:43:07.039
As you can see,
I got you some books.


937
00:43:07.266 --> 00:43:09.433
I heard your mom say
in a news conference


938
00:43:09.452 --> 00:43:11.268
that you're an avid reader.

939
00:43:11.287 --> 00:43:13.170
I am, yeah.

940
00:43:14.774 --> 00:43:18.367
I didn't know what you like,
so I just got the classics.

00:43:18.461 --> 00:43:20.277
Thank you so much.

942
00:43:20.296 --> 00:43:22.054

These are
the residential stickers.


957
00:44:23.600 --> 00:44:24.858
They're from the FBI.

958
00:44:25.011 --> 00:44:26.860
They get mailed out in bulk
from the post office.


959
00:44:27.013 --> 00:44:28.120
They said that the letter

960
00:44:28.272 --> 00:44:29.938
was sent from
about 50 miles away,


961
00:44:29.958 --> 00:44:32.607
but, you know, they also said
that whoever sent it


962
00:44:32.627 --> 00:44:35.777
could've driven that far
to mail it, so...


963
00:44:35.797 --> 00:44:38.130
But in what direction?

964
00:44:39.467 --> 00:44:41.801
[quietly] Yeah.

965
00:44:44.288 --> 00:44:45.972
Who else do we have?

966
00:44:46.199 --> 00:44:48.215
We're recruiting
some other students,


967
00:44:48.367 --> 00:44:51.310
and we have a ton of volunteers.

968

Did you know
that the billboard was paid for


969

by a local restaurant in town?

970
00:44:55.817 --> 00:44:57.224
Let's be sure
to give them a shout-out

[laughs]
Press conference.


973
00:45:01.305 --> 00:45:03.230
What press conference?
It's like pulling teeth


974
00:45:03.382 --> 00:45:05.324

00:45:12.391 --> 00:45:14.149

I know. We will
get to the bottom of it.

horrible things about her!

doing the right thing,

They're still
on the case, Zenya,

1511
01:13:00.500 --> 01:13:01.916
their resources
have been limited.


1512
01:13:03.169 --> 01:13:05.577

All right.

1515
01:13:09.400 --> 01:13:11.901
I put a post out on our page

looking for volunteers
to distribute flyers.


1517

I got three responses.

Why was the billboard
taken down?


1519

That was paid for
by a local company.


1520

that you keep her story alive,


1528

You yelled at a business owner

1534

because he wouldn't
put up a new poster?


1535
01:13:56.130 --> 01:13:57.129
I asked him

1536
01:13:57.223 --> 01:13:58.447
to put it up outside.

1537
01:13:58.466 --> 01:13:59.557
Why would he say no to that?

1538

Okay, Abby,
here's what we're gonna do.


1630
01:18:06.363 --> 01:18:07.379
We're gonna clean everything.

1631
01:18:07.531 --> 01:18:08.806
We are gonna sanitize
this entire place,


1632
01:18:08.957 --> 01:18:10.290
do you understand?

1633
01:18:10.309 --> 01:18:11.458

We cannot leave one scent

Do you understand?

1637
01:18:15.481 --> 01:18:16.388
And then what?

1638
01:18:16.540 --> 01:18:17.706
What do you mean, and then what?

1639
01:18:17.725 --> 01:18:18.798
- Where are you gonna take me?
- I don't know!

Kibby, I've done
everything you asked...

Abby, I can't.
You know this.

[Abby, panicky] Okay.

Come on. We have to start
cleaning as soon as we can.

Come on.
Come on, come on, come on.

Here, take this.

1648
01:18:32.890 --> 01:18:35.073
There can't be
an ounce of DNA anywhere.


1649
01:18:35.167 --> 01:18:37.150
Nothing.

1650

Nothing can be traced
back to me!
