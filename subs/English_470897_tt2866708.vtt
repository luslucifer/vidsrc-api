00:00:39.621 --> 00:00:41.328
<i>Is there a world beyond this one?</i>

2
00:00:43.083 --> 00:00:44.494
<i>Do we go there when we die?</i>

3
00:00:46.211 --> 00:00:47.452
<i>Does God exist?</i>

4
00:00:48.797 --> 00:00:49.797
<i>If so,</i>

5
00:00:50.841 --> 00:00:52.457
<i>why do bad things happen?</i>

6
00:00:55.178 --> 00:00:56.544
<i>As children,</i>

7
00:00:56.638 --> 00:00:59.221
<i>we ask these questions
to make sense of the world.</i>


8
00:01:00.434 --> 00:01:02.346
<i>To understand what lies ahead.</i>

9
00:01:04.771 --> 00:01:06.182
<i>But I often wonder,</i>

10
00:01:07.357 --> 00:01:08.893
<i>if we knew the whole truth,</i>

11
00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:11.646
<i>would we be less afraid...</i>

12
00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:14.941
<i>or more?</i>

13
00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:33.422
What the fuck?

14
00:02:40.367 --> 00:02:41.483
Philip?

15
00:02:43.245 --> 00:02:44.486
Philip!

16
00:02:47.332 --> 00:02:49.369
You should blow on it. It's hot.

17
00:02:50.919 --> 00:02:53.036
It's split pea.
You like split pea.


18
00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:55.338
No. Ronnie likes split pea.

19
00:02:55.424 --> 00:02:57.131
Sorry, Mr. Food Critic.

20
00:02:57.217 --> 00:02:59.004
That's what I made,
so that's what you get.


21
00:03:00.429 --> 00:03:02.029
I'll microwave something later.

22
00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:19.780
Great.

23
00:03:52.397 --> 00:03:53.478
Hi, Philip.

24
00:03:53.899 --> 00:03:55.140
Melissa.

25
00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:00.732
I didn't know that you were...

26
00:04:02.449 --> 00:04:03.656
Wow.

27
00:04:04.075 --> 00:04:05.941
- Guess it's been a long time.
- Yeah.


28
00:04:08.663 --> 00:04:10.245
Is it okay if I come in?

29
00:04:11.625 --> 00:04:14.163
No, yeah, of course. Come on in.

30
00:04:18.173 --> 00:04:19.380
Sit.

31
00:04:25.096 --> 00:04:27.088
- Let me clear...
- I got it. It's okay.


32
00:04:36.691 --> 00:04:38.398
So I heard you've
been living in the city?


33
00:04:38.485 --> 00:04:40.647
Yeah, I was, um...

34
00:04:41.655 --> 00:04:44.898
I am. Just home for a bit.

35
00:04:45.826 --> 00:04:47.053
You know, till the leg heals up.

36
00:04:47.077 --> 00:04:50.195
Yeah, ouch. Are you skiing?

37
00:04:50.288 --> 00:04:51.449
Biking...

38
00:04:51.998 --> 00:04:53.034
...poorly.

39
00:04:54.376 --> 00:04:58.916
Uh, but... Whatever.
You know, it's fine.


40
00:05:00.674 --> 00:05:01.881
Are your parents home?

41
00:05:03.802 --> 00:05:05.009
Ronnie's Melissa?

42
00:05:05.095 --> 00:05:06.836
It's been five years.
What does she want?


43
00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:08.011
She wants to see you.

44
00:05:09.891 --> 00:05:11.678
- She's pregnant.
- Oh, great!


45
00:05:11.768 --> 00:05:14.351
The last goddamn thing I wanna hear
is how goddamn happy she is.


46
00:05:14.437 --> 00:05:16.019
Mom, here's a crazy idea.

47
00:05:16.106 --> 00:05:17.938
Why don't you hear
what she has to say,

48
00:05:18.024 --> 00:05:20.357
before you freak out, okay?

49
00:05:27.701 --> 00:05:29.408
- So, you're pregnant?
- Yeah.


50
00:05:29.911 --> 00:05:32.278
About 39 weeks, give or take.

51
00:05:33.665 --> 00:05:37.124
Um, I looked for you
at the library, but,


52
00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:39.372
a woman at the front desk
said that you quit.


53
00:05:39.462 --> 00:05:42.000
Oh, I'm sure she did.
Pilia right?


54
00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:44.002
Bad die-job, tits like torpedoes?

55
00:05:45.635 --> 00:05:46.635
I guess, um,

56
00:05:48.013 --> 00:05:49.424
Mr. Chase isn't around, is he?

57
00:05:49.514 --> 00:05:51.722
No, Mr. Chase is not around.

58
00:05:51.808 --> 00:05:53.800
Mr. Chase has chosen
to become clichÃ©


59
00:05:53.894 --> 00:05:55.913
and live in West Palm Beach
with his new trophy wife.


60
00:05:55.937 --> 00:05:57.678
I know about Florida,
I just didn't...


61
00:05:57.772 --> 00:05:59.083
If you know, then why
would you assume


62
00:05:59.107 --> 00:06:00.473
that man would be in my house?

63
00:06:03.278 --> 00:06:04.735
Are you looking for money?

64
00:06:04.821 --> 00:06:07.780
- Jesus, Mom!
- It's okay.


65
00:06:07.866 --> 00:06:12.031
I know it must seem,
you know, strange,


66
00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:15.659
me showing up here
after all these years,


67
00:06:16.666 --> 00:06:19.659
but I think about
your family every day.


68
00:06:20.754 --> 00:06:22.461
Especially you, Mrs. Chase.

69
00:06:23.506 --> 00:06:25.338
Losing a child
is the hardest thing


70
00:06:25.425 --> 00:06:27.087
that could every
happen to somebody.


71
00:06:28.094 --> 00:06:29.175
And, um...

72
00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:32.012
I know that
everybody says that...


73
00:06:34.809 --> 00:06:36.175
that it wasn't my fault...

74
00:06:37.896 --> 00:06:38.977
what happened...

75
00:06:40.065 --> 00:06:41.351
But, um...

76
00:06:45.153 --> 00:06:46.394
Take your time.

77
00:06:46.821 --> 00:06:48.904
Let me just...
Sorry, this isn't coming out


78
00:06:48.990 --> 00:06:50.697
the way I wanted it
to come out, but...


79
00:06:53.536 --> 00:06:56.574
Ronnie used to have
this old stereo in his room.


80
00:06:57.916 --> 00:06:59.452
Do you know if it's still there?

81
00:07:01.753 --> 00:07:02.960
Where is this?

82
00:07:07.342 --> 00:07:09.379
I have this one in a 8x10.

83
00:07:10.011 --> 00:07:12.128
You can see how blue
his eyes are in that.


84
00:07:20.522 --> 00:07:22.263
<i>I can see in your eyes...</i>

85
00:07:23.483 --> 00:07:26.271
<i>A loss, a longing.</i>

86
00:07:26.361 --> 00:07:29.820
<i>There's a human energy here,</i>

87
00:07:29.906 --> 00:07:32.319
<i>gone before his time.</i>

88
00:07:32.409 --> 00:07:33.650
<i>Someone you love.</i>

89
00:07:33.743 --> 00:07:35.735
<i>Someone who loves
you very much.</i>


90
00:07:36.705 --> 00:07:37.866
<i>Ronnie?</i>

91
00:07:38.999 --> 00:07:41.116
<i>The image...</i>

92
00:07:41.209 --> 00:07:44.168
<i>There are pictures, photographs.</i>

93
00:07:44.796 --> 00:07:47.334
<i>His brother,
Philip took a lot of pictures.</i>


94
00:07:47.424 --> 00:07:49.381
<i>I actually think
he's a photographer now.</i>


95
00:07:49.467 --> 00:07:52.460
<i>He wants his brother
to keep taking pictures.</i>


96
00:07:52.554 --> 00:07:54.011
Are you serious?

97
00:07:54.097 --> 00:07:56.009
Is this what you
came here to tell us,


98
00:07:56.099 --> 00:07:57.806
that Ronnie
liked Philip's pictures?


99
00:07:57.892 --> 00:08:00.555
Do you have any idea what I go
through every single day?


100
00:08:00.645 --> 00:08:02.261
Every time I
walk past this door?


101
00:08:02.355 --> 00:08:05.439
Will you just listen to it?
There's... There's more.


102
00:08:12.741 --> 00:08:15.279
<i>But you're here about the baby.</i>

103
00:08:15.368 --> 00:08:16.950
<i>First love is pure</i>

104
00:08:17.037 --> 00:08:21.828
<i>because we give our entire
heart and soul to that person.</i>


105
00:08:21.916 --> 00:08:25.125
<i>He knows your pain
since he passed over.</i>


106
00:08:25.211 --> 00:08:28.500
<i>That's why he's found a way
to carry on in your life.</i>


107
00:08:29.591 --> 00:08:32.675
<i>This baby, it's a part of you.</i>

108
00:08:32.761 --> 00:08:35.754
<i>So, it's a part
of Ronnie as well.</i>


109
00:08:48.902 --> 00:08:50.018
And?

110
00:08:51.321 --> 00:08:53.779
That's it. What she said is...

111
00:08:53.865 --> 00:08:54.946
It's true.

112
00:08:55.450 --> 00:08:56.450
What's true?

113
00:08:58.536 --> 00:09:00.949
I've only been with one person...

114
00:09:02.415 --> 00:09:03.531
...in my entire life.

115
00:09:05.752 --> 00:09:06.788
And that was Ronnie,

116
00:09:06.878 --> 00:09:08.710
on the night that
he died five years ago.


117
00:09:10.340 --> 00:09:15.051
So, when I got pregnant,
I was scared and confused,


118
00:09:15.136 --> 00:09:18.345
and I didn't understand
how it was possible.


119
00:09:21.142 --> 00:09:22.178
But now I do.

120
00:09:23.228 --> 00:09:26.471
Some strange miracle has happened

121
00:09:27.565 --> 00:09:28.976
because of Ronnie.

122
00:09:30.193 --> 00:09:31.229
'Cause of our love.

123
00:09:32.237 --> 00:09:33.237
This baby...

124
00:09:35.323 --> 00:09:36.814
This baby inside of me belongs

125
00:09:37.492 --> 00:09:38.573
to Ronnie.

126
00:09:40.370 --> 00:09:41.656
It's his.

127
00:09:48.920 --> 00:09:50.377
Get her out of my house.

128
00:10:07.397 --> 00:10:08.513
Why are you doing this?

129
00:10:09.315 --> 00:10:10.772
You guys just deserve to know.

130
00:10:11.442 --> 00:10:12.523
Melissa,

131
00:10:13.736 --> 00:10:15.227
it's not possible.

132
00:10:15.321 --> 00:10:17.313
I'm not crazy, okay?

133
00:10:18.283 --> 00:10:19.490
I'm not stupid...

134
00:10:23.288 --> 00:10:25.154
It's just the only
answer that there is.


135
00:10:25.748 --> 00:10:26.909
Is it?

136
00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.538
Since the accident, I get these

137
00:10:29.627 --> 00:10:31.835
- spells, these blackouts...
- Just stop.


138
00:10:31.921 --> 00:10:35.005
- And I can feel Ronnie.
- Stop.


139
00:10:36.092 --> 00:10:38.084
- It's how I knew to see the psychic.
- Stop!


140
00:10:46.853 --> 00:10:49.891
You ever wanna talk, or...

141
00:10:53.067 --> 00:10:54.979
Come see the baby,

142
00:10:55.069 --> 00:10:57.903
I'm living in a small cottage
off Moxhull Road.


143
00:10:58.823 --> 00:11:00.030
It's my cellphone number.

144
00:11:13.004 --> 00:11:14.165
He likes your photos.

145
00:11:17.091 --> 00:11:18.423
That's something.

146
00:11:45.370 --> 00:11:47.487
<i>How's my tie?
It feels awful.</i>


147
00:11:47.580 --> 00:11:48.866
<i>It's a tie.</i>

148
00:11:48.957 --> 00:11:50.823
It's tied. Big night.

149
00:11:52.710 --> 00:11:54.121
Don't be nervous.

150
00:11:54.212 --> 00:11:56.625
- You wanna give me some tips?
- I don't know...


151
00:11:56.714 --> 00:11:58.296
Don't mess it up.

152
00:12:01.427 --> 00:12:03.635
- Wow.
- Wow.


153
00:12:03.721 --> 00:12:05.428
Where's the glass slipper?

154
00:12:05.515 --> 00:12:07.256
- Shut up.
- You look amazing.


155
00:12:07.350 --> 00:12:08.953
- Okay, let's get a picture.
- No, we're gonna be late.


156
00:12:08.977 --> 00:12:10.559
Can I just take
some when we get there?

157
00:12:10.645 --> 00:12:12.887
Oh, no, no.
One for your mom. Come on.


158
00:12:12.981 --> 00:12:16.565
Next year at this time, you're gonna be
in the city with all your friends,


159
00:12:16.651 --> 00:12:18.212
we need something
to remember you by here.


160
00:12:18.236 --> 00:12:21.445
- One picture. One picture.
- All right, okay. Smile


161
00:12:21.531 --> 00:12:22.925
Let Philip take it though,
so it's doesn't suck.


162
00:12:22.949 --> 00:12:24.360
Hey!

163
00:12:24.450 --> 00:12:27.363
The man has a point.
Big smiles. Big smiles.


164
00:12:28.288 --> 00:12:29.574
- There it is.
- Okay.


165
00:12:29.664 --> 00:12:32.122
Call me if you need anything. Oh.

166
00:12:32.750 --> 00:12:35.333
You have fun tonight, all right.
That's your job.


167
00:12:36.546 --> 00:12:38.538
You look great.

168
00:12:38.631 --> 00:12:41.339
Hey, lovebirds!
Shall we get this on the road?


169
00:12:41.426 --> 00:12:42.820
You're gonna be at
Kiera and Gordon's, right?


170
00:12:42.844 --> 00:12:43.988
- Yeah. You're gonna be there?
- Yeah.


171
00:12:44.012 --> 00:12:45.423
I'll see you there.

172
00:12:46.472 --> 00:12:48.509
See you guys.

173
00:12:48.599 --> 00:12:50.761
- Have fun.
- My baby.


174
00:12:53.563 --> 00:12:56.772
Take care!

175
00:12:56.858 --> 00:12:57.894
Bye.

176
00:13:02.947 --> 00:13:04.154
You all right?

177
00:13:06.159 --> 00:13:07.366
I'm still here, you know?

178
00:13:07.452 --> 00:13:09.444
Yeah, yeah, well obviously...

179
00:13:09.537 --> 00:13:13.406
All right, ready?
One, two, and...


180
00:13:57.543 --> 00:13:58.829
Hi, honey.

181
00:13:59.670 --> 00:14:00.831
Hi, Gail.

182
00:14:00.922 --> 00:14:03.084
You look like you could
use some ice tea.


183
00:14:04.008 --> 00:14:05.008
Perfect.

184
00:14:06.719 --> 00:14:08.155
Thank you for letting
me borrow the car.


185
00:14:08.179 --> 00:14:11.889
Oh, you kidding? Whatever Bill
and I can do to help you.


186
00:14:11.974 --> 00:14:13.966
You don't have to go
through this alone.


187
00:14:16.145 --> 00:14:17.807
I won't be alone soon enough.

188
00:14:18.773 --> 00:14:20.059
Can I?

189
00:14:20.942 --> 00:14:22.103
Of course.

190
00:14:25.571 --> 00:14:27.688
That was a big one.

191
00:14:28.324 --> 00:14:30.281
Oh!

192
00:14:30.368 --> 00:14:33.156
- It doesn't hurt, huh?
- Sometimes, but...


193
00:14:34.372 --> 00:14:35.372
I kind of like it.

194
00:14:35.373 --> 00:14:37.285
Makes me feel
like we're talking.


195
00:14:39.627 --> 00:14:43.211
Well, I do worry
about your driving,


196
00:14:43.297 --> 00:14:44.879
having one of your blackouts.

197
00:14:44.966 --> 00:14:48.050
It's been five months and the doctor says
it probably won't happen again.


198
00:14:49.887 --> 00:14:51.503
- Well!
- Ah!


199
00:14:51.597 --> 00:14:54.055
If it isn't my two favorite
people in the world.


200
00:14:54.142 --> 00:14:55.929
Oh. Sorry. Two and a half.

201
00:14:57.186 --> 00:14:58.927
Oh, Bill, you've been smoking.

202
00:14:59.021 --> 00:15:00.478
No, if you're
smelling something,


203
00:15:00.565 --> 00:15:02.147
it's because I was helping

204
00:15:02.233 --> 00:15:04.850
- Rafael load up the truck.
- Yeah, right.


205
00:15:04.944 --> 00:15:07.357
- That man is a chimney with legs.
- Mm.


206
00:15:07.447 --> 00:15:09.234
Come on. You can
frisk me if you want.

207
00:15:09.323 --> 00:15:12.191
- I'm cooking.
- Go on, check out my pockets.


208
00:15:12.285 --> 00:15:14.368
Give me a quick once over.
Melissa won't mind, right?


209
00:15:14.454 --> 00:15:15.654
Might be kind of fun to watch.

210
00:15:15.705 --> 00:15:16.912
Enough out of you two.

211
00:15:16.998 --> 00:15:18.955
Okay, I believe you.
You're not smoking.


212
00:15:19.041 --> 00:15:20.202
Go, sit down.

213
00:15:22.420 --> 00:15:24.412
So, what's for dinner?

214
00:15:25.131 --> 00:15:28.545
These new kids, they can't tell
a half inch from a quarter.


215
00:15:28.926 --> 00:15:32.419
Every damn time they pull out
a ruler, the line gets longer


216
00:15:32.513 --> 00:15:33.754
and the customers get angrier.

217
00:15:34.682 --> 00:15:36.594
You're the last good worker I've got.

218
00:15:36.684 --> 00:15:38.516
- Hmm.
- We're gonna miss you.


219
00:15:38.936 --> 00:15:41.394
I'll just be gone
a couple of months, I mean,


220
00:15:41.481 --> 00:15:44.519
once the baby comes,
I'll be back in no time.


221
00:15:46.652 --> 00:15:47.984
That's actually something that

222
00:15:48.070 --> 00:15:49.732
I wanted to talk
to you guys about.


223
00:15:51.115 --> 00:15:52.356
Since my parents aren't, uh...

224
00:15:52.992 --> 00:15:55.405
Since they've chosen
not to be involved,


225
00:15:57.079 --> 00:15:59.947
I was wondering...
I was hoping that


226
00:16:00.958 --> 00:16:04.247
maybe you two would
be the guardians <i>ad litem.</i>


227
00:16:05.463 --> 00:16:07.375
It's just in case
something goes wrong,


228
00:16:07.465 --> 00:16:08.831
and I can't make a decision,

229
00:16:08.925 --> 00:16:11.713
then you guys would be
in charge of me, and...


230
00:16:12.720 --> 00:16:15.007
- And the baby.
- Are you sure?


231
00:16:15.932 --> 00:16:17.673
- Yeah.
- I mean, you don't wanna


232
00:16:17.767 --> 00:16:20.635
try to contact the father?

233
00:16:21.354 --> 00:16:25.439
- Gail.
- I mean, a child needs a family.


234
00:16:25.525 --> 00:16:28.108
You guys are the closest thing
that I have to a family.


235
00:16:33.950 --> 00:16:35.157
We'd be honored.

236
00:16:36.744 --> 00:16:37.744
Yes.

237
00:16:40.456 --> 00:16:41.456
It's just in case.

238
00:16:46.671 --> 00:16:48.273
<i>You've got a little girl now.</i>

239
00:16:48.297 --> 00:16:50.163
<i>I do. Her name's Acacia.</i>

240
00:16:50.258 --> 00:16:51.715
<i>Acacia? Beautiful.</i>

241
00:16:51.801 --> 00:16:53.633
<i>You didn't chose it, did you?</i>

242
00:16:53.719 --> 00:16:58.134
<i>No. She's almost two years old,
and I have to tell you this,</i>


243
00:16:58.224 --> 00:17:00.637
<i>she did this most amazing
thing yesterday.</i>


244
00:17:00.726 --> 00:17:03.469
<i>Does this involve diapers
because we recently had...</i>


245
00:17:03.563 --> 00:17:05.099
<i>No, no. It's very clean.</i>

246
00:17:05.189 --> 00:17:08.682
<i>She has this doll, and she sucks
on his fingers, of course.</i>


247
00:17:08.776 --> 00:17:12.770
<i>Okay, stop. You clearly promised
that it was going to be a clean story.</i>


248
00:17:12.863 --> 00:17:17.198
<i>- You're not allowed to...
- So I'm putting her down for a nap,</i>


249
00:17:18.327 --> 00:17:20.660
<i>she's sucking on his fingers,
and she starts to sing</i>


250
00:17:20.746 --> 00:17:23.159
<i>"Itsy Bitsy Spider,"
so I'm singing it too...</i>


251
00:17:25.585 --> 00:17:27.417
Why would you say that?

252
00:17:44.979 --> 00:17:46.186
What happened to your hand?

253
00:17:46.272 --> 00:17:47.272
I cut it.

254
00:17:47.815 --> 00:17:49.727
So you duck taped it?
It's what I had.


255
00:17:49.817 --> 00:17:51.524
You wanna talk about my hand?

256
00:17:51.611 --> 00:17:53.477
After that, we'll talk
about your leg, okay?


257
00:18:04.832 --> 00:18:05.832
Hmm.

258
00:18:07.043 --> 00:18:09.786
Isn't this a healthy
start to the morning?


259
00:18:09.879 --> 00:18:12.587
- Why do you have to be so sarcastic?
- Oh, you think I'm...


260
00:18:14.842 --> 00:18:16.674
You know, forget it.

261
00:18:16.761 --> 00:18:18.878
You're obviously still
upset about yesterday.


262
00:18:19.555 --> 00:18:21.547
You're a selfish young man.

263
00:18:21.641 --> 00:18:23.678
That's what I've raised,
a selfish young man.


264
00:18:23.768 --> 00:18:25.600
This woman...

265
00:18:25.686 --> 00:18:28.804
this girl get herself knocked up
and then comes stalking around,


266
00:18:28.898 --> 00:18:30.480
pointing the finger at my dead son.

267
00:18:31.317 --> 00:18:32.961
As far as I'm concerned,
I let her off easy.


268
00:18:32.985 --> 00:18:35.068
- I should have called the cops.
- Fascinating.


269
00:18:37.823 --> 00:18:38.984
You're on her side?

270
00:18:41.202 --> 00:18:42.202
Philip?

271
00:18:43.913 --> 00:18:45.449
Why are you on her side?

272
00:18:46.332 --> 00:18:47.618
Philip, hey!

273
00:18:47.708 --> 00:18:49.745
Why are you on her side?

274
00:18:49.835 --> 00:18:51.121
I'm not on anybody's side.

275
00:18:51.212 --> 00:18:52.328
There's no side to have.

276
00:18:52.421 --> 00:18:55.038
Both you and Melissa
are equally delusional.


277
00:18:55.132 --> 00:18:57.670
That is my point.
It is completely impossible.


278
00:18:57.760 --> 00:19:00.343
Well, it's not completely impossible.

279
00:19:00.429 --> 00:19:01.636
You are on her side.

280
00:19:01.722 --> 00:19:03.429
Okay, I'm not saying that I believe her.

281
00:19:03.516 --> 00:19:05.633
All I'm saying
is that if you think about it,


282
00:19:05.726 --> 00:19:07.446
there's a chance that
what she said is true.


283
00:19:08.270 --> 00:19:10.762
Then explain it to me. Please.

284
00:19:12.525 --> 00:19:13.641
Look, if...

285
00:19:14.527 --> 00:19:15.768
it's a big if,

286
00:19:15.861 --> 00:19:18.945
Ronnie's sperm was somehow
frozen before he died,


287
00:19:19.031 --> 00:19:22.240
there's a chance that Melissa
could've used it, and impregnated herself,


288
00:19:22.326 --> 00:19:24.989
years later, and thus
we would have Ronnie's baby.


289
00:19:26.038 --> 00:19:27.654
That's ridiculous.

290
00:19:27.748 --> 00:19:30.240
He was a teenager with
his whole life ahead of him,


291
00:19:30.334 --> 00:19:31.541
why would he do that?

292
00:19:32.586 --> 00:19:34.168
Philip?

293
00:19:34.255 --> 00:19:35.587
Someone's in here.

294
00:19:39.844 --> 00:19:41.176
People do it all the time.

295
00:19:41.262 --> 00:19:43.595
- What people?
- I don't know, Mom, people.


296
00:19:43.681 --> 00:19:44.717
Friends of yours?

297
00:19:45.933 --> 00:19:48.095
Philip?

298
00:19:48.185 --> 00:19:49.705
You need to get a grip,
and give it up.


299
00:19:49.729 --> 00:19:52.972
Oh, okay, yeah,
just, just walk away.


300
00:19:54.817 --> 00:19:56.604
You're just gonna
block it out of your mind?


301
00:19:56.694 --> 00:19:58.185
Just like that?

302
00:19:58.279 --> 00:19:59.861
Well, I can't do that.

303
00:20:02.700 --> 00:20:03.907
This is my son

304
00:20:03.993 --> 00:20:06.531
she's talking about, Philip.
Your brother.


305
00:20:56.587 --> 00:20:57.998
Where's the computer lab?

306
00:20:58.088 --> 00:21:00.705
Used to be right there.
Now it's some sorta Starbucks?


307
00:21:00.800 --> 00:21:01.800
Charlene?

308
00:21:02.968 --> 00:21:03.968
Pilia.

309
00:21:04.804 --> 00:21:06.170
It's okay, Bailey, I've got it.

310
00:21:08.516 --> 00:21:09.973
It's been a while.

311
00:21:10.059 --> 00:21:11.721
How are you?

312
00:21:11.811 --> 00:21:13.268
Every day's a blessing.

313
00:21:14.772 --> 00:21:16.183
Where's the computer lab?

314
00:21:16.273 --> 00:21:18.139
We scaled back
the lab years ago.


315
00:21:19.151 --> 00:21:20.983
Why don't you just follow me.

316
00:21:21.070 --> 00:21:22.936
We got a grant
to digitize all the pre-articles


317
00:21:23.030 --> 00:21:24.817
and research papers
going back six years.


318
00:21:24.907 --> 00:21:26.990
So, whatever you're
looking to research,


319
00:21:27.076 --> 00:21:28.487
it'll be relatively easy to find.

320
00:21:28.577 --> 00:21:33.242
I'm the highest credentialed librarian
this institution has, or will ever see.


321
00:21:33.332 --> 00:21:34.914
I know how to use a search bar.

322
00:21:41.257 --> 00:21:44.796
The system resets itself
every few years if the cards aren't used.


323
00:21:45.719 --> 00:21:47.255
So, I'll update it.

324
00:21:48.722 --> 00:21:49.758
You can use mine for now.

325
00:21:53.227 --> 00:21:55.219
Now, there are some tricks
to these searches.


326
00:21:55.312 --> 00:21:57.112
For example, what are you
looking to research?


327
00:21:57.189 --> 00:21:59.397
I don't see how
that's any of your business.


328
00:21:59.984 --> 00:22:03.022
Right. Okay, well, if you need me,
you know where to find me.


329
00:22:03.112 --> 00:22:04.523
Sitting behind my desk.

330
00:22:06.657 --> 00:22:08.614
It's good to see you again, Charlene.

331
00:22:25.342 --> 00:22:27.504
<i>After the ejaculate
has been donated,</i>


332
00:22:27.595 --> 00:22:29.322
<i>and the sperm properly collected...</i>

333
00:22:29.346 --> 00:22:31.546
<i>...cryoprotectants are added,
and the sperm is frozen...</i>


334
00:22:42.651 --> 00:22:44.608
"Medically assisted reproduction...

335
00:22:49.158 --> 00:22:51.445
"Recent advances allow for collection

336
00:22:51.535 --> 00:22:55.950
"of sperm samples to occur for up to

337
00:22:59.376 --> 00:23:00.787
"After death."

338
00:24:25.170 --> 00:24:27.412
So it's four-wheel drive,
all-standard features...


339
00:24:28.340 --> 00:24:30.002
Excuse me, I'll be right back.

340
00:24:30.801 --> 00:24:33.714
Let me guess,
you're looking for something safe.


341
00:24:33.804 --> 00:24:34.804
Am I right?

342
00:24:35.889 --> 00:24:40.554
Oh, shit! Philly C.
How you doin', man?


343
00:24:40.644 --> 00:24:42.010
Chaz.

344
00:24:42.312 --> 00:24:43.974
It's good to see you.

345
00:24:44.064 --> 00:24:46.556
Yeah.
Sweats and tee, casual choice.


346
00:24:46.650 --> 00:24:48.812
I like it. I like it.

347
00:24:48.902 --> 00:24:51.189
What's up with the leg, man?

348
00:24:51.280 --> 00:24:54.694
Uh, bike accident.
I was going up Broadway,


349
00:24:54.783 --> 00:24:58.618
and some asshole in a
convertible ran a red doing 50.


350
00:24:58.704 --> 00:25:00.661
- Oof.
- Yeah, like...


351
00:25:00.956 --> 00:25:03.243
- Lucky it was just your leg.
- Yeah.


352
00:25:03.834 --> 00:25:05.450
Yeah, I know.

353
00:25:05.544 --> 00:25:06.955
So, what are you looking at?

354
00:25:07.629 --> 00:25:09.666
- What?
- What kind of car?


355
00:25:10.507 --> 00:25:12.749
I can hook you up. Junior Salesman
as of last month.


356
00:25:12.843 --> 00:25:16.007
- Wow.
- 40k base, commissions on top,


357
00:25:16.096 --> 00:25:19.305
and I can take any one of these bad boys
out for the night.


358
00:25:19.391 --> 00:25:20.427
Impress the ladies.

359
00:25:20.517 --> 00:25:23.100
So, you and Stacy aren't still together?

360
00:25:23.187 --> 00:25:26.931
We still see each other, but
it's not, you know, exclusive.


361
00:25:27.733 --> 00:25:30.396
- Right.
- Come on, I'll show you the good stuff.


362
00:25:31.320 --> 00:25:32.606
Hey, what about Melissa?

363
00:25:33.363 --> 00:25:34.854
You still talk to her?

364
00:25:35.532 --> 00:25:37.364
Uh, it's been a bit.

365
00:25:37.451 --> 00:25:39.488
She kind of freaked out
after what happened.


366
00:25:39.578 --> 00:25:40.785
You know, blamed herself.

367
00:25:42.247 --> 00:25:44.159
So, what is she doing now?

368
00:25:45.042 --> 00:25:46.533
She dating anybody?

369
00:25:46.627 --> 00:25:47.913
Don't think so.

370
00:25:48.003 --> 00:25:50.791
To be honest, I don't really
think she moved on at all.


371
00:25:50.881 --> 00:25:53.089
Her parents kicked
her out a few years back.


372
00:25:53.175 --> 00:25:54.652
So she's not really
in the loop anymore.


373
00:25:54.676 --> 00:25:56.417
Why'd her parents kick her out?

374
00:25:56.512 --> 00:25:58.754
Some tight-ass
Christian bullshit.


375
00:25:58.847 --> 00:26:02.011
Her pop got pissed off at all
that magic stuff she was into.


376
00:26:02.101 --> 00:26:03.101
Magic?

377
00:26:04.103 --> 00:26:05.184
What do you mean?

378
00:26:06.396 --> 00:26:09.389
I don't know,
she as always going on about


379
00:26:09.483 --> 00:26:12.601
talking to the dead,
contacting spirits, re-incarnation.


380
00:26:13.153 --> 00:26:15.520
She wanted to talk
to Ronnie again, you know?


381
00:26:16.406 --> 00:26:19.194
Oh, but Stacy saw her down at
the hardware store last month.


382
00:26:19.785 --> 00:26:21.447
- Preggo.
- Preggo?


383
00:26:21.537 --> 00:26:23.654
- Wow.
- So...


384
00:26:23.747 --> 00:26:25.033
She must be dating somebody,

385
00:26:25.124 --> 00:26:26.660
Right? At least
for a couple minutes.


386
00:26:27.835 --> 00:26:30.077
You want her number?
I bet Stace still has it.


387
00:26:30.170 --> 00:26:32.127
No. I was just wondering.

388
00:26:32.214 --> 00:26:33.580
- You sure?
- Yeah.


389
00:26:33.674 --> 00:26:35.586
You two always had a thing.

390
00:26:37.261 --> 00:26:38.672
Hey, no, no, it's cool.

391
00:26:38.762 --> 00:26:39.948
I just mean, Ronnie
would have liked


392
00:26:39.972 --> 00:26:41.679
you looking out for her, that's all.

393
00:26:54.194 --> 00:26:55.839
<i>South Miami Hospital
Fertility Clinic.</i>


394
00:26:55.863 --> 00:26:57.024
Dr. Richard Chase.

395
00:26:57.114 --> 00:26:58.980
- <i>Who's calling please?</i>
- His wife.


396
00:26:59.074 --> 00:27:01.532
<i>- Is this urgent?</i>
- Yes, it's urgent.


397
00:27:01.743 --> 00:27:05.202
Cathy at the front desk, she'll put
something in the books for next month.


398
00:27:05.289 --> 00:27:07.702
But, looks really good. All right?

399
00:27:10.502 --> 00:27:13.620
Dr. Chase, your wife's on the phone.
She says it's urgent.


400
00:27:14.381 --> 00:27:15.542
Holly, what's wrong?

401
00:27:15.632 --> 00:27:18.500
<i>Wrong wife.
But you sure answered quickly, didn't you?</i>


402
00:27:19.261 --> 00:27:22.174
For Christs' sake, Charlene,
you can't do that.


403
00:27:22.264 --> 00:27:23.345
I was with a patient.

404
00:27:23.432 --> 00:27:25.799
- Can you freeze sperm?
- You're calling me for what?


405
00:27:25.893 --> 00:27:28.977
- Can you freeze sperm?
<i>- Of course, you can freeze it.</i>


406
00:27:29.062 --> 00:27:30.849
Post mortem?

407
00:27:30.939 --> 00:27:32.601
<i>Yeah, it's been done. Yes.</i>

408
00:27:32.691 --> 00:27:35.274
- By anyone you know?
- What are you driving at?


409
00:27:35.360 --> 00:27:37.317
<i>We had a visit from Melissa Moody.</i>

410
00:27:37.404 --> 00:27:38.404
<i>She's pregnant.</i>

411
00:27:38.488 --> 00:27:40.605
But, wait, it gets better.

412
00:27:42.659 --> 00:27:44.025
I'll call you back.

413
00:27:44.912 --> 00:27:47.575
None of what you're saying
makes any sense. It's impossible.


414
00:27:47.664 --> 00:27:49.267
<i>Yeah, welcome to the goddamn club.</i>

415
00:27:49.291 --> 00:27:51.829
But then Philip got me thinking,
and so I did some research,


416
00:27:51.919 --> 00:27:54.286
"Post-mortem cryogenic preservation."

417
00:27:54.379 --> 00:27:56.496
You think Melissa froze Ronnie's sperm.

418
00:27:56.590 --> 00:27:58.752
<i>Well, who was working the night
they brought Ronnie in?</i>


419
00:27:58.842 --> 00:28:00.629
Oh, yes, that was you.
And then I thought,


420
00:28:00.719 --> 00:28:03.302
that just the sort of freak stunt
my husband would pull.


421
00:28:03.388 --> 00:28:04.799
That would be ex-husband.

422
00:28:04.890 --> 00:28:07.883
<i>Ex-husband. Trust me,
I thank God for that every day,</i>


423
00:28:07.976 --> 00:28:10.468
and now you're acting cagey,
so I know something's up.


424
00:28:10.562 --> 00:28:12.804
<i>Okay, so let me make sure
I got this straight,</i>


425
00:28:12.898 --> 00:28:15.641
you believe that I
extracted Ronnie's sperm,


426
00:28:15.734 --> 00:28:19.694
after her was dead, and I froze it,
and I put it in Melissa nine months ago?


427
00:28:19.780 --> 00:28:21.692
<i>The girl knew you lived in Florida.</i>

428
00:28:21.782 --> 00:28:23.944
- Why is that?
<i>- I have no idea.</i>


429
00:28:24.034 --> 00:28:26.026
So you haven't seen her,
or spoken to her?


430
00:28:27.287 --> 00:28:29.307
What's this really about?
You want me to come up there?


431
00:28:29.331 --> 00:28:30.600
Oh, you'd like that, wouldn't you?

432
00:28:30.624 --> 00:28:32.206
White Knight riding up on his horse.

433
00:28:32.292 --> 00:28:34.579
No. You stay down there
with Malibu Barbie.


434
00:28:34.670 --> 00:28:36.206
Don't bring Holly into this.

435
00:28:37.464 --> 00:28:38.464
Hello?

436
00:28:55.440 --> 00:28:57.272
Look who's home early.

437
00:28:58.026 --> 00:28:59.026
Hey.

438
00:29:00.779 --> 00:29:02.611
Couldn't live without me, could ya?

439
00:29:07.536 --> 00:29:09.198
- Bad day?
- No.


440
00:29:10.497 --> 00:29:12.454
Feinstein baby delivered early.

441
00:29:12.541 --> 00:29:13.622
It's a boy.

442
00:29:14.501 --> 00:29:15.617
<i>Mazel tov.</i>

443
00:29:19.339 --> 00:29:20.500
Charlene called.

444
00:29:21.508 --> 00:29:23.249
Little off the deep end.

445
00:29:23.343 --> 00:29:26.381
And she's usually pretty hostile,
but she seemed...


446
00:29:27.347 --> 00:29:28.347
I don't know, scared.

447
00:29:28.682 --> 00:29:30.389
Of what?

448
00:29:30.475 --> 00:29:32.888
Communication is not her strong suite.

449
00:29:32.978 --> 00:29:34.094
So, I don't know.

450
00:29:35.439 --> 00:29:37.897
I'm sure it's nothing.
I'm sure you're right.


451
00:29:45.490 --> 00:29:48.107
- Knock-knock. Room service.
- Oh!


452
00:29:54.333 --> 00:29:55.494
What did you do to this?

453
00:29:55.584 --> 00:29:58.201
It's sugar free. I was hoping
you wouldn't notice.


454
00:29:58.295 --> 00:30:00.773
Well, you might as well slap me
on the face and call it a kiss.


455
00:30:02.758 --> 00:30:05.796
Bill, you've got to see a doctor
about this cough.


456
00:30:06.970 --> 00:30:08.962
Don't look at me like that, I'm fine.

457
00:30:09.056 --> 00:30:12.220
All right, well, please
don't stay out too late.


458
00:30:12.309 --> 00:30:15.052
- The floor won't fix itself.
- Yeah.


459
00:30:15.145 --> 00:30:18.229
- Are you gonna drink that?
- Yeah, I'm drinking. Thank you.


460
00:30:19.149 --> 00:30:20.811
Hurry up.

461
00:30:20.901 --> 00:30:22.893
Five more boards, then I'm done.

462
00:30:51.556 --> 00:30:54.173
- Hey, dad.
- Hey, buddy, how you doing?


463
00:30:54.267 --> 00:30:55.599
<i>Same old, same old.</i>

464
00:30:55.685 --> 00:30:57.551
Yeah? How's the leg holding up?

465
00:30:58.772 --> 00:30:59.888
It's still attached.

466
00:31:01.233 --> 00:31:03.941
Well, good. Hopefully you're
getting outta the house,


467
00:31:04.027 --> 00:31:06.269
finding a few good shots.

468
00:31:06.363 --> 00:31:08.104
<i>Camera's still busted up, so...</i>

469
00:31:08.198 --> 00:31:10.861
I'm pretty much stuck inside
staring at contact sheets.


470
00:31:10.951 --> 00:31:12.692
<i>Oh, listen, if you
need a new camera,</i>


471
00:31:12.786 --> 00:31:14.573
I'm happy to do it, okay?

472
00:31:14.663 --> 00:31:15.995
It's no big deal.

473
00:31:16.081 --> 00:31:17.822
It's okay. I got it covered.

474
00:31:20.001 --> 00:31:21.458
I spoke to your mom.

475
00:31:22.170 --> 00:31:24.662
She, um,
she told me about Melissa.


476
00:31:24.756 --> 00:31:26.088
<i>I bet she did.</i>

477
00:31:26.508 --> 00:31:27.965
Kind of threw mom for a loop.

478
00:31:29.177 --> 00:31:31.840
How... How did she seem to you? Melissa?

479
00:31:31.930 --> 00:31:33.512
<i>Seems pretty damn pregnant.</i>

480
00:31:33.598 --> 00:31:35.931
No, no, no. I mean, you know...

481
00:31:37.102 --> 00:31:38.513
does she seem stable?

482
00:31:38.603 --> 00:31:41.812
Just bringing up
Ronnie like that, and


483
00:31:41.898 --> 00:31:43.810
not saying who the father was.

484
00:31:43.900 --> 00:31:47.689
<i>I don't know,
things seemed pretty strange.</i>


485
00:31:47.779 --> 00:31:49.190
But I don't think it's our problem.

486
00:31:50.407 --> 00:31:53.525
No. No, of course, not.

487
00:31:55.829 --> 00:31:57.445
It's not. I just, um...

488
00:31:58.665 --> 00:32:01.310
Look, I just wanted to check on you,
and see how guys are holding up.


489
00:32:01.334 --> 00:32:03.576
<i>Yeah, well,
mom's gone off the reservation.</i>


490
00:32:04.296 --> 00:32:05.377
I can barely take a piss

491
00:32:05.464 --> 00:32:07.296
without getting it
all over myself, so...


492
00:32:08.091 --> 00:32:09.091
Yeah,

493
00:32:10.010 --> 00:32:11.296
things are not the best.

494
00:32:12.220 --> 00:32:13.586
Listen,

495
00:32:13.680 --> 00:32:16.343
Philip, if you need anything,
I just want you to ask.


496
00:32:16.433 --> 00:32:18.220
Okay, I'm here for you.

497
00:32:18.310 --> 00:32:20.267
Sure, dad. Got it.

498
00:32:22.564 --> 00:32:24.146
Tell Holly I say hi.

499
00:32:24.232 --> 00:32:27.816
I will. Take care of yourself.
I love you.


500
00:32:27.903 --> 00:32:29.019
<i>Yeah, you too.</i>

501
00:32:37.996 --> 00:32:40.454
<i>- Hello, Bill's Hardware.</i>
- Bill Herman, please.


502
00:33:09.778 --> 00:33:10.894
Mom?

503
00:33:11.863 --> 00:33:13.570
Is that you?

504
00:33:13.657 --> 00:33:16.195
I brought dinner.
Come down.


505
00:33:19.579 --> 00:33:20.945
Coming.

506
00:34:14.759 --> 00:34:17.217
No one likes a nosey neighbor.

507
00:34:17.971 --> 00:34:20.179
- I was just cleaning up.
- Uh-huh.


508
00:34:21.933 --> 00:34:24.391
- She seems happy, right?
- Why not?


509
00:34:25.520 --> 00:34:26.520
Baby on the way.

510
00:34:26.605 --> 00:34:28.187
Yeah, but she's all alone.

511
00:34:28.898 --> 00:34:31.515
Why won't she tell us
who the father is.


512
00:34:31.610 --> 00:34:34.318
She has her own life to lead.

513
00:34:34.404 --> 00:34:37.693
- It doesn't matter you don't approve.
- That's not what I meant.


514
00:34:37.782 --> 00:34:38.943
She's not our daughter.

515
00:34:39.034 --> 00:34:42.072
We open ourselves up,
do what we can. Let her get on.


516
00:34:42.954 --> 00:34:44.195
You'll see.

517
00:34:45.123 --> 00:34:46.705
Everything will be okay.

518
00:34:48.293 --> 00:34:49.409
Hmm.

519
00:35:02.807 --> 00:35:03.923
I'm off to the library.

520
00:35:04.517 --> 00:35:06.008
- Really?
- Really.


521
00:35:06.102 --> 00:35:08.469
- What are your big plans?
- Solve world hunger.


522
00:35:08.563 --> 00:35:09.849
Smart ass.

523
00:36:38.153 --> 00:36:40.019
Gum's for the children.

524
00:36:40.113 --> 00:36:41.590
You're welcome
to have a piece if you like.


525
00:36:41.614 --> 00:36:47.235
Sorry, I'm looking for a woman
named Chantel.


526
00:36:47.328 --> 00:36:49.820
Chantrel. You found her.

527
00:36:50.373 --> 00:36:51.373
Philip.

528
00:36:51.458 --> 00:36:54.917
Ah. Now you're doing my job for me.

529
00:36:55.003 --> 00:37:01.000
Uh, you had a client recently
named Melissa. She was pregnant.


530
00:37:01.092 --> 00:37:04.927
I can't talk about others
who've come for my guidance,


531
00:37:05.013 --> 00:37:07.241
but you're welcome to come
and have a session for yourself.


532
00:37:07.265 --> 00:37:09.257
No, thank you.

533
00:37:10.643 --> 00:37:11.884
What happened to your leg?

534
00:37:13.521 --> 00:37:15.137
I don't wanna do your job for you.

535
00:37:15.231 --> 00:37:17.564
I'm a psychic, not a surgeon.

536
00:37:20.111 --> 00:37:22.103
But I can tell it embarrasses you.

537
00:37:23.990 --> 00:37:25.572
And you lie about it.

538
00:37:30.121 --> 00:37:32.864
You're like a regular visitor now.

539
00:37:32.957 --> 00:37:36.200
Yeah, well,
I'm doing research on children.


540
00:37:36.294 --> 00:37:38.160
I might be a grandmother soon.

541
00:37:38.254 --> 00:37:39.254
Might?

542
00:37:40.006 --> 00:37:41.338
Congratulations.

543
00:37:44.511 --> 00:37:45.843
Well, I should get going.

544
00:37:47.639 --> 00:37:49.596
I didn't steal your job, Charlene.

545
00:37:52.227 --> 00:37:54.014
You didn't show up for six months.

546
00:37:54.854 --> 00:37:57.392
The place was going downhill.
Someone had to take over.


547
00:38:00.527 --> 00:38:01.688
I know.

548
00:38:03.947 --> 00:38:06.405
So... what now?

549
00:38:06.699 --> 00:38:08.190
You, um,

550
00:38:08.284 --> 00:38:09.570
you tell my future?

551
00:38:09.661 --> 00:38:11.402
The future hasn't happened yet.

552
00:38:12.121 --> 00:38:14.454
I tell your present.
The parts you can't see.


553
00:38:18.461 --> 00:38:19.827
I'd like a strand of your hair.

554
00:38:20.213 --> 00:38:22.876
- A strand of my...
- Watch.


555
00:38:28.346 --> 00:38:29.632
Ah, okay.

556
00:38:30.640 --> 00:38:31.640
What is that for?

557
00:38:31.724 --> 00:38:34.683
The things we see,
and feel, and do,


558
00:38:34.769 --> 00:38:36.556
they stay inside us.

559
00:38:36.646 --> 00:38:40.811
Joy and pain lives on
long after you experience it.


560
00:38:40.900 --> 00:38:44.234
It's the same
for everyone, everything.


561
00:38:44.320 --> 00:38:46.277
We carry it alike.

562
00:38:46.364 --> 00:38:49.528
Man, bird, fly...

563
00:38:49.617 --> 00:38:52.906
what lives in one,
can live in another.


564
00:38:52.996 --> 00:38:54.703
That's what connects us.

565
00:38:56.791 --> 00:38:58.248
That's what gives us strength.

566
00:39:04.841 --> 00:39:06.423
You think about Ronnie often.

567
00:39:11.389 --> 00:39:13.426
- He's here?
- No.


568
00:39:14.309 --> 00:39:17.723
But Melissa had
a boyfriend Ronnie, right?


569
00:39:18.396 --> 00:39:20.183
And Ronnie
had a brother, Philip?


570
00:39:22.609 --> 00:39:24.942
Half this job
is just having a good memory.


571
00:39:32.577 --> 00:39:34.034
Your pain is deep.

572
00:39:35.330 --> 00:39:36.912
But it's different than hers.

573
00:39:38.917 --> 00:39:42.501
This emptiness,
it's not gonna go away,


574
00:39:42.587 --> 00:39:44.954
because you're not ready to be whole.

575
00:39:45.048 --> 00:39:48.758
You've tied yourself
to the world around you, but


576
00:39:48.843 --> 00:39:52.678
there's more answers than
those you can touch and see.


577
00:39:55.767 --> 00:40:00.182
You don't believe we live
in a world beyond this one.


578
00:40:00.980 --> 00:40:02.687
What, like ghosts?

579
00:40:03.274 --> 00:40:05.436
It's all right, you don't have
to believe in ghosts.


580
00:40:06.444 --> 00:40:09.061
I do. That's my truth.

581
00:40:10.406 --> 00:40:15.401
And Melissa believes,
and it's true for her.


582
00:40:15.495 --> 00:40:18.329
But the question is,
what do you believe in?


583
00:40:22.752 --> 00:40:25.836
That's why you run from
the things you find difficult.


584
00:40:27.173 --> 00:40:29.711
The things you find painful,

585
00:40:29.801 --> 00:40:32.384
you ignore, or ridicule.

586
00:40:33.805 --> 00:40:36.889
- That's why you've given up on yourself.
- Okay.


587
00:40:36.975 --> 00:40:40.059
And you've
given up on everyone else.


588
00:40:41.688 --> 00:40:44.396
Find your truth,
whatever or whoever that is.


589
00:40:44.482 --> 00:40:47.145
Only then will you walk out
of the shadows.


590
00:40:57.745 --> 00:41:00.613
I'm not supposed
to be telling you this.


591
00:41:02.166 --> 00:41:05.455
He says that
there's a chance you could get hurt.


592
00:41:05.545 --> 00:41:06.752
Who says?

593
00:41:07.296 --> 00:41:08.296
Ronnie?

594
00:41:08.381 --> 00:41:11.715
There could be trouble for you...

595
00:41:13.511 --> 00:41:15.252
For those you're close to.

596
00:41:33.197 --> 00:41:34.358
That's it.

597
00:41:37.243 --> 00:41:38.825
You know what you have to do.

598
00:41:43.082 --> 00:41:45.074
I take Visa and Mastercard.

599
00:42:03.770 --> 00:42:05.682
Oh, can I help you?

600
00:42:05.772 --> 00:42:07.855
Hi, I'm looking for Melissa Moody.

601
00:42:07.940 --> 00:42:12.105
Her cottage is in the back,
but she's at work right now.


602
00:42:12.195 --> 00:42:14.152
- Oh, okay.
- You would be?


603
00:42:15.114 --> 00:42:16.855
I'm Charlene Chase.

604
00:42:16.949 --> 00:42:19.441
Ronnie was my son.

605
00:42:19.535 --> 00:42:21.618
- Melissa's boyfriend.
- I'm so glad to meet you.


606
00:42:21.704 --> 00:42:24.788
God, Melissa's...

607
00:42:24.874 --> 00:42:30.370
really a wonderful girl, and she
speaks very lovingly of Ronnie.


608
00:42:30.838 --> 00:42:33.626
- Thank you.
- Everything that you have done for her...


609
00:42:35.218 --> 00:42:36.959
Above and beyond the call of duty...

610
00:42:38.346 --> 00:42:40.338
- I'm sorry?
- The rent for the cottage.


611
00:42:40.431 --> 00:42:43.469
Dr. Chase sends that check every month.

612
00:42:43.559 --> 00:42:44.891
Right on time.

613
00:42:48.481 --> 00:42:50.017
I'm... I'm sorry...

614
00:42:51.692 --> 00:42:55.936
I get confused.
Mrs. Chase? I'm sorry, I...


615
00:42:56.906 --> 00:42:58.317
Calm down, or I'm hanging up.

616
00:42:58.407 --> 00:43:00.569
No, no, no. You don't get
to tell me what to do.


617
00:43:00.660 --> 00:43:02.652
Look, I have done nothing
to you, not a thing,


618
00:43:02.745 --> 00:43:05.099
- if you want Richard to call you back...
<i>- Listen, you little tramp,</i>


619
00:43:05.123 --> 00:43:07.740
you put that lying sack of shit
on the phone right now.


620
00:43:07.834 --> 00:43:09.666
Or so help me god,
I will come down to Florida


621
00:43:09.752 --> 00:43:12.460
and shove a palm tree up that
perfectly bleached asshole of yours!


622
00:43:12.547 --> 00:43:14.664
<i>He's gone to New York!
He's gone to see you!</i>


623
00:43:42.326 --> 00:43:43.362
Ah!

624
00:43:49.584 --> 00:43:50.584
Wha...

625
00:43:54.797 --> 00:43:56.333
Oh, you've gotta be kidding me.

626
00:44:17.570 --> 00:44:18.811
Thank you for stopping by.

627
00:44:24.493 --> 00:44:26.576
- Who's that?
- It's Gail.


628
00:44:26.662 --> 00:44:28.369
If it isn't my favorite person.

629
00:44:28.456 --> 00:44:32.700
Yeah, so, I was just down in the
basement doing some laundry...


630
00:44:32.793 --> 00:44:36.002
Rafael! You need
to restock the mops, okay?


631
00:44:36.923 --> 00:44:38.255
Sorry, hon, go on.

632
00:44:38.341 --> 00:44:40.128
<i>Yeah, and then
I was coming back up</i>


633
00:44:40.218 --> 00:44:42.380
and a sock rolled on the floor.

634
00:44:44.430 --> 00:44:45.430
And...

635
00:44:47.016 --> 00:44:48.016
And?

636
00:44:48.935 --> 00:44:53.100
Yeah, and I don't know,
I did something to my back.


637
00:44:53.522 --> 00:44:56.606
When I went to pick it up,
I hurt it, so


638
00:44:56.692 --> 00:45:00.857
I'd rather not make dinner tonight
if that's okay with you.


639
00:45:00.947 --> 00:45:03.360
Whatever you want, hon.
I'll bring something home.


640
00:45:03.449 --> 00:45:05.907
- Anything in particular?
- Oh. You decide.


641
00:45:07.620 --> 00:45:08.620
Bill?

642
00:45:09.664 --> 00:45:11.576
You're feeling okay, right?

643
00:45:11.666 --> 00:45:13.123
Yeah, strong as an ox.

644
00:45:13.209 --> 00:45:15.166
You would tell me
if anything was wrong.


645
00:45:15.253 --> 00:45:16.744
Seriously wrong, right?

646
00:45:16.837 --> 00:45:19.500
Of course.
What's gotten into you?


647
00:45:19.590 --> 00:45:21.752
Oh, nothing. I'm just...

648
00:45:21.842 --> 00:45:23.504
Forget it, I'm just tired.

649
00:45:23.594 --> 00:45:25.927
<i>You go lie down, take it easy,</i>

650
00:45:26.013 --> 00:45:28.130
and I'll be home
before you know it.


651
00:45:28.224 --> 00:45:30.261
- Love you.
- Love you.


652
00:45:56.252 --> 00:45:57.959
Miss me?

653
00:45:58.045 --> 00:46:01.083
- What are you doing here?
- You took the words right out of my mouth.


654
00:46:02.758 --> 00:46:04.758
- I'm here to see Philip.
- Oh, so you didn't bring


655
00:46:04.844 --> 00:46:06.051
a big fat check with you?

656
00:46:06.137 --> 00:46:08.925
The alimony's direct deposit.
I've never missed a payment.


657
00:46:09.015 --> 00:46:11.849
Do you use the same account
to pay Melissa Moody's rent?


658
00:46:13.227 --> 00:46:14.227
Why would you do that?

659
00:46:14.770 --> 00:46:16.477
What else are you
keeping from me, Richard?


660
00:46:16.564 --> 00:46:17.680
Charlene...

661
00:46:17.773 --> 00:46:20.186
You just have this big
web of deceit going on,


662
00:46:20.276 --> 00:46:21.276
and now I have proof.

663
00:46:21.360 --> 00:46:23.943
- You son of a bitch!
- Okay, I'm not doing this right now.


664
00:46:24.030 --> 00:46:25.942
No, I can't think
of a better place to do it.


665
00:46:26.032 --> 00:46:27.113
Enough!

666
00:46:27.700 --> 00:46:29.692
I'm here to see Philip. That's it.

667
00:46:29.785 --> 00:46:32.368
Well, he's on my sofa, so you
might as well get in my car.


668
00:46:39.462 --> 00:46:40.669
That false labor again?

669
00:46:42.214 --> 00:46:43.214
Yeah.

670
00:46:45.051 --> 00:46:46.542
What's it feel like?

671
00:46:46.635 --> 00:46:48.797
Feels... tight.

672
00:46:48.888 --> 00:46:51.380
Like everything's clamping up.

673
00:46:51.932 --> 00:46:53.076
Doctor says
I'll know the difference


674
00:46:53.100 --> 00:46:54.100
when it actually happens.

675
00:46:55.102 --> 00:46:56.889
When the baby comes, what then?

676
00:46:56.979 --> 00:46:58.720
Then I'll be a mom.

677
00:47:02.276 --> 00:47:03.812
Best job there is.

678
00:47:06.906 --> 00:47:08.772
Me and Gail tried to have kids.

679
00:47:10.618 --> 00:47:12.655
Gail's body just wouldn't take.

680
00:47:13.746 --> 00:47:17.160
We tried a bunch of times,
but she just kept losing them.


681
00:47:17.750 --> 00:47:19.241
I didn't know that.

682
00:47:19.627 --> 00:47:22.290
- I'm sorry.
- It made it hard on us,


683
00:47:22.380 --> 00:47:23.871
as a husband and wife...

684
00:47:24.924 --> 00:47:27.211
as a couple.

685
00:47:27.301 --> 00:47:29.509
That's a beautiful thing,
having kids,


686
00:47:29.595 --> 00:47:30.881
raising them up.

687
00:47:30.971 --> 00:47:32.633
A man has
a lifetime of experience


688
00:47:32.723 --> 00:47:33.839
that he wants to pass down,

689
00:47:33.933 --> 00:47:35.890
something to leave behind.

690
00:47:37.144 --> 00:47:40.933
You know, um,
Gail will never say it, but


691
00:47:41.023 --> 00:47:43.390
she looks at you like

692
00:47:43.484 --> 00:47:48.479
God brought us
the little girl we never had.


693
00:48:06.006 --> 00:48:07.497
Okay. Here...

694
00:48:09.343 --> 00:48:11.071
- Where are we?
- No, no, no. It's a surprise.


695
00:48:11.095 --> 00:48:12.711
Okay. No peeking.

696
00:48:14.098 --> 00:48:16.385
You sure you don't wanna
go back to prom, and


697
00:48:16.475 --> 00:48:18.011
see the king
and queen announced?


698
00:48:18.102 --> 00:48:20.059
Think I'll live without it.
You want to?


699
00:48:20.146 --> 00:48:21.432
No.

700
00:48:21.522 --> 00:48:24.230
Little further. Little further.
Okay, right here.


701
00:48:24.316 --> 00:48:25.602
One second.

702
00:48:25.693 --> 00:48:26.809
Eyes closed.

703
00:48:28.737 --> 00:48:30.228
Okay, open your eyes.

704
00:48:32.199 --> 00:48:34.657
I still can't see anything.
I know, just one more second.


705
00:48:57.683 --> 00:48:58.890
Okay.

706
00:49:01.937 --> 00:49:03.223
You like it?

707
00:49:03.314 --> 00:49:05.977
- Did you do all this?
- Phil helped a little.


708
00:49:08.319 --> 00:49:09.319
All right.

709
00:50:02.540 --> 00:50:03.540
I'm ready.

710
00:50:04.375 --> 00:50:05.375
It's perfect.

711
00:50:17.429 --> 00:50:18.429
Gail?

712
00:50:29.650 --> 00:50:30.650
Hon?

713
00:50:34.405 --> 00:50:35.405
Gail?

714
00:50:47.751 --> 00:50:48.751
Gail?

715
00:51:39.178 --> 00:51:40.339
You might wanna slow down.

716
00:51:40.429 --> 00:51:43.672
That's how you wanna start
this conversation? Try again.


717
00:51:45.059 --> 00:51:47.642
Yes, I have been paying Melissa's rent.

718
00:51:47.728 --> 00:51:49.936
Oh, look at that?
A bit of truth.


719
00:51:50.022 --> 00:51:53.891
So what makes a grown man pay
the rent of a woman... a girl...


720
00:51:53.984 --> 00:51:55.816
he hasn't seen in five years.

721
00:51:59.406 --> 00:52:00.522
You have seen her.

722
00:52:00.616 --> 00:52:03.154
Holy hell, Richard. You are
a regular bullshit factory!


723
00:52:03.243 --> 00:52:06.281
I come up to the city a couple
of times a year, Charlene.


724
00:52:06.372 --> 00:52:09.160
Barry and I still have
a stake in the medical plaza.


725
00:52:09.249 --> 00:52:10.990
You come in
and you don't call me?


726
00:52:11.085 --> 00:52:14.123
No! No, I don't tell you.

727
00:52:15.089 --> 00:52:16.455
You've made this impossible.

728
00:52:16.548 --> 00:52:18.505
You made it clear
you want nothing to do with me.


729
00:52:18.967 --> 00:52:20.503
Philip's in the city,

730
00:52:20.594 --> 00:52:23.553
and yes, I have seen Melissa.

731
00:52:27.768 --> 00:52:29.976
- I knew it.
- Oh, calm down, Charlene.


732
00:52:30.062 --> 00:52:33.021
I'm trying to help.
Maybe explain if I could.


733
00:52:33.107 --> 00:52:34.188
Can't wait to hear it.

734
00:52:37.861 --> 00:52:41.445
After Ronnie died, I wanted
to talk about him, Charlene.


735
00:52:42.991 --> 00:52:44.431
I couldn't do that
with you, could I?


736
00:52:44.493 --> 00:52:47.361
You were either curled up
playing dead, or lashing out,


737
00:52:47.454 --> 00:52:50.162
and I sure as hell couldn't
lay my grief off onto Philip.


738
00:52:52.209 --> 00:52:53.245
So, every day...

739
00:52:54.795 --> 00:52:56.832
my bubble just
got a little bit smaller.


740
00:52:57.631 --> 00:52:59.839
And I had no idea
how to make it stop.


741
00:53:01.593 --> 00:53:03.380
One day I was out jogging,

742
00:53:05.389 --> 00:53:07.881
down by the ravine,
not far from where Ronnie died,


743
00:53:10.144 --> 00:53:11.476
I saw her...

744
00:53:12.980 --> 00:53:13.980
Melissa.

745
00:53:16.024 --> 00:53:17.024
And I...

746
00:53:18.902 --> 00:53:20.689
I could have kept going,

747
00:53:20.779 --> 00:53:22.674
let her deal on her own,
but I didn't wanna do that.


748
00:53:22.698 --> 00:53:24.234
I wanted to talk
to her, I want to...


749
00:53:26.076 --> 00:53:27.612
to be with her.

750
00:53:27.703 --> 00:53:29.365
And somehow,

751
00:53:30.706 --> 00:53:32.493
I knew she needed me
in the same way.


752
00:53:59.693 --> 00:54:00.900
Shit.

753
00:54:16.084 --> 00:54:18.167
- Hey.
- Hey.


754
00:54:18.253 --> 00:54:20.231
- Come in.
- Thanks for meeting me.


755
00:54:20.255 --> 00:54:21.917
Oh, no, of course.

756
00:54:22.007 --> 00:54:25.842
I'm really glad you called. It's nice
getting off work early sometimes.


757
00:54:26.261 --> 00:54:29.049
Sit down. Can I get you
some tea or something?


758
00:54:29.139 --> 00:54:30.346
I just have herbal, but...

759
00:54:31.558 --> 00:54:33.470
No. Thank you though.

760
00:54:37.231 --> 00:54:38.312
Sorry about the...

761
00:54:39.566 --> 00:54:40.566
No.

762
00:54:51.245 --> 00:54:52.781
We're quite the pair, huh?

763
00:54:53.413 --> 00:54:54.494
The blunder twins.

764
00:55:09.471 --> 00:55:10.471
You know, I lied.

765
00:55:11.974 --> 00:55:13.135
Um?

766
00:55:13.225 --> 00:55:14.306
About my leg.

767
00:55:14.768 --> 00:55:16.054
It wasn't a bike accident?

768
00:55:17.062 --> 00:55:18.143
It was a bike.

769
00:55:21.942 --> 00:55:23.228
Ronnie and I,

770
00:55:24.361 --> 00:55:25.713
we were supposed
to move to New York.


771
00:55:25.737 --> 00:55:27.319
I remember, yeah.

772
00:55:27.406 --> 00:55:29.523
He talked about it a lot.

773
00:55:30.242 --> 00:55:32.074
So, after...

774
00:55:33.579 --> 00:55:36.287
what happened,
once I was finished with school,


775
00:55:36.665 --> 00:55:39.624
I figured, you know, this is
what Ronnie and I said we'd do.


776
00:55:40.669 --> 00:55:44.413
So, I got a place...
moved to New York.


777
00:55:44.506 --> 00:55:46.919
My dad sent money to cover the rent.

778
00:55:48.468 --> 00:55:50.425
But...

779
00:55:50.512 --> 00:55:53.129
You know, we were supposed
to make it, you know?


780
00:55:53.223 --> 00:55:56.557
On our own,
so in comes the day job.


781
00:55:57.644 --> 00:55:59.601
- Bike messenger.
- In Manhattan?


782
00:55:59.688 --> 00:56:01.179
In Manhattan.

783
00:56:01.815 --> 00:56:04.398
I was actually
pretty good at it,


784
00:56:04.818 --> 00:56:06.605
but at the end
of the day I was alone.


785
00:56:07.988 --> 00:56:11.732
I met people,
but it wasn't the same.


786
00:56:13.660 --> 00:56:15.322
It wasn't what we planned.

787
00:56:18.081 --> 00:56:21.950
So, one day I got a package and
I'm cruising down Fifth Avenue,


788
00:56:22.794 --> 00:56:24.501
and, uh,

789
00:56:24.588 --> 00:56:27.296
in the corner of my eye,
I see this yellow


790
00:56:28.175 --> 00:56:29.175
Honda Prelude

791
00:56:30.469 --> 00:56:32.552
cruising alone,

792
00:56:34.264 --> 00:56:35.345
and all I have to do,

793
00:56:36.934 --> 00:56:38.641
is turn the bike
a little to the left,


794
00:56:38.727 --> 00:56:39.934
and I miss him by a mile.

795
00:56:43.982 --> 00:56:44.982
But I don't turn.

796
00:56:46.735 --> 00:56:48.271
- You weren't trying to...
- No.


797
00:56:49.363 --> 00:56:51.525
No, I wasn't trying to kill myself.

798
00:56:54.868 --> 00:56:58.282
I guess I just needed
a reason to leave.


799
00:57:00.374 --> 00:57:01.374
You know, to give up,

800
00:57:03.210 --> 00:57:06.624
without giving up.

801
00:57:15.389 --> 00:57:16.505
I should have tried harder

802
00:57:17.641 --> 00:57:18.641
with you.

803
00:57:20.268 --> 00:57:22.931
- I know that now.
- You left us.


804
00:57:23.438 --> 00:57:26.055
I did. I found a way to move on,
and you hadn't.


805
00:57:27.359 --> 00:57:30.397
I knew I'd fall right back into it
unless I got the hell out.


806
00:57:32.155 --> 00:57:33.521
And I know what it did,

807
00:57:35.242 --> 00:57:38.155
to us, to Philip,

808
00:57:38.870 --> 00:57:40.156
we crumbled.

809
00:57:40.247 --> 00:57:42.034
I live with it every day.

810
00:57:42.124 --> 00:57:43.706
What did you do to her, Richard?

811
00:57:48.213 --> 00:57:50.956
- Charlene...
- What did you do, Richard?


812
00:58:13.196 --> 00:58:14.607
Thank you

813
00:58:15.907 --> 00:58:17.114
for trusting me.

814
00:58:18.827 --> 00:58:20.989
The fact still remains I quit.

815
00:58:21.079 --> 00:58:23.492
I took a way out, but...

816
00:58:26.168 --> 00:58:27.500
God, here you are!

817
00:58:28.962 --> 00:58:30.578
As big as a house...

818
00:58:30.672 --> 00:58:33.335
on the edge
of this giant step, and... and


819
00:58:33.425 --> 00:58:35.917
you still have the guts
to go toe-to-toe with my mother.


820
00:58:37.387 --> 00:58:38.594
You're the whole goddamn town.

821
00:58:39.723 --> 00:58:40.964
You didn't quit.

822
00:58:42.434 --> 00:58:44.141
And I want you know
that you're not alone.


823
00:58:46.313 --> 00:58:49.602
I might not believe
that this is Ronnie's baby,


824
00:58:51.526 --> 00:58:53.017
but I believe that you believe it.

825
00:58:54.154 --> 00:58:57.272
And I believe that Ronnie
would have believed it too.


826
00:58:58.492 --> 00:58:59.653
So...

827
00:59:01.078 --> 00:59:02.614
if that makes me an uncle...

828
00:59:04.956 --> 00:59:06.072
so be it.

829
00:59:09.753 --> 00:59:10.869
I...

830
00:59:13.131 --> 00:59:14.167
It's not like...

831
00:59:15.217 --> 00:59:18.255
it's not like I'm so sure, 24/7.

832
00:59:21.556 --> 00:59:24.424
Some days it's hard enough just

833
00:59:25.268 --> 00:59:26.304
waking up.

834
00:59:27.521 --> 00:59:30.810
Some days I wake up, and

835
00:59:32.234 --> 00:59:33.896
I don't remember
much of anything.


836
00:59:40.033 --> 00:59:43.902
<i>I pass out,
and I dream about Ronnie.</i>


837
00:59:45.539 --> 00:59:46.871
<i>And the night we made love.</i>

838
00:59:49.334 --> 00:59:52.702
<i>But, when I come to the next morning,</i>

839
00:59:55.006 --> 00:59:57.623
<i>everything just feels off,</i>

840
00:59:59.511 --> 01:00:01.377
<i>just feels different.</i>

841
01:00:03.640 --> 01:00:04.847
So I make mistakes,

842
01:00:06.351 --> 01:00:07.762
I get confused,

843
01:00:08.478 --> 01:00:09.764
Join the club.

844
01:00:09.855 --> 01:00:11.062
And I know...

845
01:00:12.274 --> 01:00:13.936
I know everybody talks about me.

846
01:00:15.235 --> 01:00:21.323
The psycho pregnant girl with the
dead boyfriend.


847
01:00:22.742 --> 01:00:23.823
But...

848
01:00:26.872 --> 01:00:28.408
But it's okay.

849
01:00:29.249 --> 01:00:32.583
Gail? Can you
come down here for a sec?


850
01:00:34.838 --> 01:00:36.295
<i>What did you do to her?</i>

851
01:00:36.798 --> 01:00:38.881
Nothing. At first, we just talked...

852
01:00:40.510 --> 01:00:41.842
About Ronnie,

853
01:00:41.928 --> 01:00:44.511
and that silly accent
he used to do.


854
01:00:44.598 --> 01:00:46.464
His clothes, anything.

855
01:00:47.767 --> 01:00:49.258
After a while,

856
01:00:49.352 --> 01:00:52.641
we filled in the gaps where
our normal lives fell apart.


857
01:00:54.191 --> 01:00:57.184
Melissa's parents found out.
They didn't approve.


858
01:00:57.277 --> 01:00:59.143
I guess it got heated
and she moved out,


859
01:00:59.237 --> 01:01:00.773
and I felt like I
owed it to Ronnie to


860
01:01:01.615 --> 01:01:02.731
take care of her.

861
01:01:03.366 --> 01:01:05.608
I got her a place, paid the rent,

862
01:01:07.120 --> 01:01:09.237
gave her some
spare cash the first year.


863
01:01:11.249 --> 01:01:12.365
And the next.

864
01:01:15.837 --> 01:01:18.454
After a while,
it just became habit.


865
01:01:19.758 --> 01:01:20.965
Like anything else.

866
01:01:21.843 --> 01:01:23.550
So, you didn't sleep with her?

867
01:01:24.888 --> 01:01:26.845
Christ! No, Charlene.

868
01:01:29.142 --> 01:01:30.508
Of course, not.

869
01:01:32.145 --> 01:01:33.386
Who would do that?

870
01:01:34.272 --> 01:01:37.060
It's like I'm trying to find my way out
of one of those corn mazes


871
01:01:37.150 --> 01:01:38.561
that they put up at Thanksgiving,

872
01:01:40.111 --> 01:01:43.900
and I'm going down a different
path than everyone else.


873
01:01:46.034 --> 01:01:47.616
But I know it's the right one.

874
01:01:51.373 --> 01:01:54.582
Meanwhile, everyone else is going down
their own paths thinking about


875
01:01:55.543 --> 01:01:57.000
how wrong everyone else is.

876
01:01:59.631 --> 01:02:03.420
But, I figure if I go my way,

877
01:02:05.679 --> 01:02:07.045
and you go yours,

878
01:02:11.768 --> 01:02:13.848
<i>we're all gonna wind up
in the same place in the end.</i>


879
01:02:20.694 --> 01:02:22.060
I... I wanna apologize.

880
01:02:24.864 --> 01:02:25.900
For what?

881
01:02:26.491 --> 01:02:27.572
For the cigarettes.

882
01:02:29.244 --> 01:02:30.985
I see you found 'em.

883
01:02:31.079 --> 01:02:34.072
That's an old stash, before our
conversation the other night.


884
01:02:34.666 --> 01:02:37.033
That's all right, Bill.
I understand.


885
01:02:37.711 --> 01:02:40.294
It's over now, I swear it.

886
01:02:42.590 --> 01:02:43.956
Forgive me?

887
01:02:50.974 --> 01:02:52.886
I went to the pharmacy

888
01:02:52.976 --> 01:02:56.219
to find out what they were
because I thought you were sick.


889
01:02:56.730 --> 01:03:00.189
You... you son of a bitch!

890
01:03:00.275 --> 01:03:02.062
Now wait a minute,
let's not get unhinged.


891
01:03:02.152 --> 01:03:04.690
How should I react? You tell me!

892
01:03:04.779 --> 01:03:06.145
It's not like that.

893
01:03:06.531 --> 01:03:09.569
God! 30 years!

894
01:03:10.410 --> 01:03:12.197
Under the same roof.

895
01:03:13.246 --> 01:03:17.081
The whole time, 
I was the idiot!

896
01:03:17.167 --> 01:03:19.204
I don't know what it is
you think you know.


897
01:03:19.294 --> 01:03:21.911
Rohypnol, Bill! Roofies!

898
01:03:24.299 --> 01:03:27.633
Yeah. I know what they are,
I've seen the news.


899
01:03:28.720 --> 01:03:31.838
Melissa doesn't
know who the father is


900
01:03:31.931 --> 01:03:33.263
because she was passed out.

901
01:03:33.350 --> 01:03:35.307
Now, let's just take a breather.

902
01:03:35.393 --> 01:03:37.976
- Step back for a second...
- She trusted us!


903
01:03:48.365 --> 01:03:49.572
How long?

904
01:03:54.037 --> 01:03:55.037
How long?

905
01:03:59.334 --> 01:04:01.417
I found the pills
in the evidence lock up


906
01:04:01.503 --> 01:04:02.710
right before I left the force.

907
01:04:05.090 --> 01:04:06.171
I don't know why.

908
01:04:07.842 --> 01:04:08.923
I just took 'em.

909
01:04:11.930 --> 01:04:13.717
I didn't even plan on using them.

910
01:04:14.474 --> 01:04:15.474
It was just...

911
01:04:20.522 --> 01:04:22.184
It was supposed to be

912
01:04:23.316 --> 01:04:25.524
less complicated.

913
01:04:27.570 --> 01:04:28.570
Oh.

914
01:04:29.030 --> 01:04:30.771
You did...

915
01:04:30.865 --> 01:04:33.403
- You did...
- I didn't want to, I...


916
01:04:33.493 --> 01:04:36.782
I couldn't control it.
I tried, but I kept...


917
01:04:38.081 --> 01:04:40.448
- Gail, Gail, please!
- You bastard!


918
01:04:40.542 --> 01:04:42.374
- You monster!
- Gail!


919
01:04:43.711 --> 01:04:45.373
- Gail! Stop!
- Get out of the way.


920
01:04:55.056 --> 01:04:56.172
Gail?

921
01:04:58.184 --> 01:04:59.846
Oh, God! No.

922
01:05:01.104 --> 01:05:02.104
Gail?

923
01:05:05.525 --> 01:05:06.561
Oh!

924
01:05:09.904 --> 01:05:11.691
Ohh, oh.

925
01:05:16.411 --> 01:05:17.527
No.

926
01:05:52.030 --> 01:05:53.030
The car.

927
01:05:54.115 --> 01:05:56.072
- What about it?
- It's gone.


928
01:05:57.160 --> 01:05:59.160
Well, he probably went
to meet up with his friends.


929
01:05:59.913 --> 01:06:02.371
He can barely walk,
much less drive.


930
01:06:02.665 --> 01:06:03.781
Philip?

931
01:06:05.627 --> 01:06:06.627
It's Dad!

932
01:06:10.757 --> 01:06:12.965
- The keys are gone.
- He took the car.


933
01:06:13.426 --> 01:06:14.837
It was great seeing you.

934
01:06:17.055 --> 01:06:19.889
- I'll see you around.
- Yeah. Take care.


935
01:06:31.778 --> 01:06:33.314
Ahh!

936
01:06:41.120 --> 01:06:42.452
Philip!

937
01:06:44.541 --> 01:06:45.748
Philip!

938
01:06:48.461 --> 01:06:50.828
Philip!

939
01:06:55.093 --> 01:06:56.584
Philip!

940
01:06:59.389 --> 01:07:01.005
Hang on. I'm coming!

941
01:07:01.099 --> 01:07:04.342
Philip!

942
01:07:04.435 --> 01:07:06.142
Hang on, I'm coming.

943
01:07:07.897 --> 01:07:09.889
- You okay?
- It's the baby.


944
01:07:10.984 --> 01:07:12.566
What, did you fall?

945
01:07:12.652 --> 01:07:14.314
- I think it's coming.
- Okay.


946
01:07:14.404 --> 01:07:15.895
All right, can you stand up?

947
01:07:16.489 --> 01:07:19.653
Whoa, what's wrong?
What's the matter?


948
01:07:19.742 --> 01:07:22.485
- You okay?
- Just keep walking. It's okay, it's okay.


949
01:07:22.579 --> 01:07:24.036
Put your arm
on my shoulder, okay?


950
01:07:24.998 --> 01:07:27.035
Okay. Almost there.

951
01:07:27.125 --> 01:07:28.912
Please tell me you have the key.

952
01:07:29.002 --> 01:07:30.743
You can just move that fence.

953
01:07:30.837 --> 01:07:32.169
Move the fence. Okay.

954
01:07:37.719 --> 01:07:40.587
- Okay. Back door's unlocked.
- Back door.


955
01:07:42.682 --> 01:07:43.763
Deep breaths.

956
01:07:46.561 --> 01:07:48.081
- You good?
- Yeah, I'm okay, I'm okay.


957
01:07:52.025 --> 01:07:53.311
Wait, wait, wait. I need Gail.

958
01:07:53.401 --> 01:07:54.878
I need Gail and Bill to come, please.

959
01:07:54.902 --> 01:07:56.188
- What?
- They're my guardians.


960
01:07:56.279 --> 01:07:57.881
- Please will you go get them?
- No, we'll call them


961
01:07:57.905 --> 01:07:59.383
- from the hospital.
- No, I really need them.


962
01:07:59.407 --> 01:08:00.676
They're just down there
at the next cottage.


963
01:08:00.700 --> 01:08:03.060
You just have to go down there.
They're right there. Please?


964
01:08:04.287 --> 01:08:06.199
Okay, yeah.

965
01:08:06.289 --> 01:08:08.121
No, yeah. Okay
You just wait there.


966
01:08:08.666 --> 01:08:10.248
Thank you. Sorry.

967
01:08:14.464 --> 01:08:15.464
Okay.

968
01:08:17.467 --> 01:08:19.550
Couldn't just accept the ride.

969
01:08:27.977 --> 01:08:28.977
Hello?

970
01:08:35.985 --> 01:08:37.226
Anybody home?

971
01:08:40.073 --> 01:08:41.073
Hello?

972
01:09:11.562 --> 01:09:13.474
I'll call someone
and get some help.


973
01:09:45.555 --> 01:09:47.296
- Mom? Mom.
<i>- Philip?</i>


974
01:09:47.390 --> 01:09:49.006
<i>- Where the hell are you?</i>
- Listen...


975
01:09:49.100 --> 01:09:50.557
listen, I'm at Melissa's okay.

976
01:09:50.643 --> 01:09:53.003
<i>- You shouldn't be driving, you know that.</i>
- Listen... fuck!


977
01:10:03.239 --> 01:10:05.652
I don't know what
you think you saw.


978
01:10:05.742 --> 01:10:07.108
It was an accident.

979
01:10:19.714 --> 01:10:21.546
Ah, ah!

980
01:11:22.235 --> 01:11:23.601
What the fuck!

981
01:11:42.505 --> 01:11:43.746
Ah!

982
01:13:17.475 --> 01:13:19.182
Philip!

983
01:13:23.648 --> 01:13:25.480
Philip!

984
01:13:29.779 --> 01:13:31.771
Philip!

985
01:14:22.957 --> 01:14:24.368
- Hey, guys.
- Yo, yo!


986
01:14:24.458 --> 01:14:27.542
- Hi.
- Dude! Dude, you missed the end.


987
01:14:27.628 --> 01:14:29.836
The prom king got wasted
and fell of the stage.


988
01:14:29.922 --> 01:14:31.629
It was hilarious.

989
01:14:31.716 --> 01:14:33.378
Yeah, it's a shame to miss it.

990
01:14:34.343 --> 01:14:36.926
Oh, yeah? Real shame, huh?

991
01:14:37.763 --> 01:14:39.254
Here.

992
01:14:40.766 --> 01:14:44.851
Driver, the lovers have arrived.
Onwards!


993
01:15:11.130 --> 01:15:13.463
Philip!

994
01:15:22.600 --> 01:15:23.761
Okay.

995
01:15:24.977 --> 01:15:26.093
Okay.

996
01:15:41.118 --> 01:15:43.861
It's not connecting.

997
01:15:43.954 --> 01:15:46.742
- Reception's bad out here.
- He's in trouble.


998
01:15:47.458 --> 01:15:48.790
I heard it in his voice.

999
01:15:48.876 --> 01:15:50.356
Well, maybe it's the baby, she's due.

1000
01:15:50.419 --> 01:15:52.411
Well, then why doesn't
he pick up his phone?


1001
01:15:52.505 --> 01:15:53.505
He's driving.

1002
01:15:54.006 --> 01:15:55.588
He doesn't wanna talk on the phone.

1003
01:15:55.674 --> 01:15:57.006
He's a smart kid.

1004
01:16:05.267 --> 01:16:06.553
Hey.

1005
01:16:07.645 --> 01:16:09.136
We'll find him.

1006
01:16:09.563 --> 01:16:12.772
- Do you remember when Ronnie was born?
- Of course.


1007
01:16:13.734 --> 01:16:15.441
Oh, that labor was so painful.

1008
01:16:17.363 --> 01:16:18.979
I was screaming my head off.

1009
01:16:21.909 --> 01:16:24.777
But then when the doctor put his
little body right on my chest,


1010
01:16:24.870 --> 01:16:26.611
I just started laughing.

1011
01:16:29.250 --> 01:16:30.536
Do you remember?

1012
01:16:30.626 --> 01:16:32.583
Yeah.

1013
01:16:33.504 --> 01:16:34.540
He was so happy.

1014
01:16:39.510 --> 01:16:41.172
I think about that a lot.

1015
01:16:47.935 --> 01:16:49.096
Richard...

1016
01:16:49.979 --> 01:16:50.979
the gate.

1017
01:17:07.163 --> 01:17:08.765
- No!
- That's how you wanna start


1018
01:17:08.789 --> 01:17:09.950
this conversation?

1019
01:17:30.728 --> 01:17:31.728
Hello?

1020
01:17:33.606 --> 01:17:34.606
Hello?

1021
01:17:38.819 --> 01:17:41.527
- Forget it, nobody's here. Come on.
- No, no. Let's look around.


1022
01:17:44.241 --> 01:17:45.527
Dr. Chase.

1023
01:17:46.368 --> 01:17:47.529
Nice to see you again.

1024
01:17:48.204 --> 01:17:52.574
Hey, Bill. Yeah, I moved
my trip up a couple of days.


1025
01:17:52.666 --> 01:17:55.329
Um, sorry to bother you,
this is a little odd.


1026
01:17:55.419 --> 01:17:58.332
We... We're looking for our son, Philip.

1027
01:17:58.422 --> 01:18:00.584
He's 21, brown hair.
He's on crutches.


1028
01:18:00.674 --> 01:18:03.792
We got a call from him. He was
gonna meet up with Melissa,


1029
01:18:03.886 --> 01:18:05.593
but nobody's at the house. So...

1030
01:18:06.513 --> 01:18:09.597
I've been here for a bit,
and I haven't seen anyone.


1031
01:18:11.560 --> 01:18:13.597
You don't think the baby's come?
Do you?


1032
01:18:13.687 --> 01:18:16.430
I think that's a real possibility, yes.

1033
01:18:16.523 --> 01:18:19.357
That's probably where he is,
down at the hospital.


1034
01:18:19.443 --> 01:18:20.729
You should check it out.

1035
01:18:20.819 --> 01:18:24.358
Uh, Gail's gone down
to the store for some food.


1036
01:18:24.448 --> 01:18:26.610
As soon as she's back,
we'll be on your tail.


1037
01:18:27.618 --> 01:18:29.280
Okay. Okay, good.

1038
01:18:29.370 --> 01:18:31.370
Sorry to bother you,
we'll see you at the hospital.


1039
01:18:31.705 --> 01:18:34.664
- Ah.
- Oh. Your head. What happened?


1040
01:18:35.417 --> 01:18:36.533
Uh...

1041
01:18:38.087 --> 01:18:39.953
Number one rule in carpentry,

1042
01:18:40.965 --> 01:18:42.627
don't daydream.

1043
01:18:42.716 --> 01:18:45.556
- I should take a look at that.
- Oh, no, it's nothing. It's just a cut.


1044
01:18:46.929 --> 01:18:50.513
Nothing I haven't done a thousand times.

1045
01:18:50.599 --> 01:18:53.091
So, I'll see you down at the maternity.

1046
01:18:56.063 --> 01:18:57.349
Okay.

1047
01:19:05.781 --> 01:19:07.113
Something's not right.

1048
01:19:07.199 --> 01:19:09.441
Charlene, you don't know that, all right.

1049
01:19:09.535 --> 01:19:11.846
- We're gonna go to the hospital...
- Why the hell are you so calm?


1050
01:19:11.870 --> 01:19:13.611
Because I'm not
jumping to conclusions.


1051
01:19:13.706 --> 01:19:15.663
You didn't hear him, Richard.
He's in trouble.


1052
01:19:15.749 --> 01:19:16.990
We will find him.

1053
01:19:17.084 --> 01:19:19.622
You didn't hear him, Richard.
He's not safe!


1054
01:19:24.383 --> 01:19:25.794
Shh.

1055
01:19:26.760 --> 01:19:29.127
- Richard...
- Okay, Charlene.


1056
01:19:29.596 --> 01:19:30.757
Richard.

1057
01:20:01.295 --> 01:20:03.412
Whoa, whoa, whoa, okay,
somebody get me a wheelchair.


1058
01:20:04.048 --> 01:20:05.334
Wheelchair, now.

1059
01:20:05.841 --> 01:20:08.800
Okay, okay. Hang in there.
I want you to breathe.


1060
01:20:08.886 --> 01:20:10.548
Easy does it. There you go.

1061
01:20:11.388 --> 01:20:13.471
Okay. How far apart
are your contractions?


1062
01:20:14.350 --> 01:20:17.184
Like... I don't know, a minute.

1063
01:20:17.269 --> 01:20:19.761
Okay, is there
someone we can call?


1064
01:20:19.855 --> 01:20:22.063
- Gail Herman.
- Can you tell me your name, honey?


1065
01:20:38.707 --> 01:20:39.743
Wait here.

1066
01:20:40.501 --> 01:20:41.501
Please.

1067
01:21:45.983 --> 01:21:47.099
Where are you?

1068
01:21:49.653 --> 01:21:50.689
Where are you?

1069
01:22:41.413 --> 01:22:42.413
Jesus.

1070
01:22:48.003 --> 01:22:49.003
Richard.

1071
01:22:50.380 --> 01:22:51.962
She's dead.

1072
01:22:52.049 --> 01:22:53.790
- Snapped her neck.
- Oh, my God.


1073
01:22:54.218 --> 01:22:57.586
Outside. Outside. Call 911.

1074
01:22:57.679 --> 01:22:59.824
- I'm not getting a signal.
- Try it again.


1075
01:22:59.848 --> 01:23:01.743
- We have to find Philip.
- He's not in the house.


1076
01:23:01.767 --> 01:23:03.759
- What do we do, Richard?
- I'm trying 911.


1077
01:23:03.852 --> 01:23:06.435
- What do we do?
- I don't know, it won't connect.


1078
01:23:06.522 --> 01:23:07.642
I'm not leaving without him.

1079
01:23:35.801 --> 01:23:37.758
Okay. That's it, that's it.
Big breath.


1080
01:23:37.844 --> 01:23:40.507
And bare down.
Push, push, push, push.


1081
01:23:40.597 --> 01:23:43.681
Come on, you can do this.
Push, push, push, push.


1082
01:23:43.767 --> 01:23:45.133
You can do it.

1083
01:23:59.908 --> 01:24:01.024
Oh.

1084
01:24:18.302 --> 01:24:19.463
I'm so sorry.

1085
01:24:25.392 --> 01:24:26.633
Help!

1086
01:24:26.727 --> 01:24:29.060
- Richard.
- I heard it.


1087
01:24:40.824 --> 01:24:44.158
Quiet. Please, be quiet.

1088
01:24:44.244 --> 01:24:46.236
- That was Philip.
- Philip!


1089
01:24:47.247 --> 01:24:48.454
Philip?

1090
01:24:53.962 --> 01:24:55.169
Philip!

1091
01:25:11.438 --> 01:25:12.929
The woods.

1092
01:25:13.023 --> 01:25:14.583
- Charlene! No, no!
- He's in the woods.


1093
01:25:35.962 --> 01:25:37.248
Oh, God.

1094
01:25:41.259 --> 01:25:42.545
Philip!

1095
01:25:49.601 --> 01:25:50.762
Philip?

1096
01:26:03.365 --> 01:26:04.365
Bill?

1097
01:26:26.972 --> 01:26:28.213
I never meant to hurt her.

1098
01:26:34.479 --> 01:26:35.540
- No!
- No!


1099
01:26:41.737 --> 01:26:43.069
I love you, Ronnie.

1100
01:26:45.615 --> 01:26:46.615
I love you, too.

1101
01:26:51.121 --> 01:26:52.487
You don't sound so sure.

1102
01:27:02.758 --> 01:27:04.124
I love Melissa Moody.

1103
01:27:07.554 --> 01:27:09.090
You know,

1104
01:27:09.181 --> 01:27:13.095
saying it to three people just
really isn't that impressive.


1105
01:27:21.526 --> 01:27:22.526
Whatcha doing?

1106
01:27:24.237 --> 01:27:26.775
- I'm gonna tell the world.
- Yeah?


1107
01:27:29.201 --> 01:27:31.693
Hey, world!

1108
01:27:31.787 --> 01:27:33.744
I love Melissa Moody!

1109
01:27:35.540 --> 01:27:38.283
Dude, you're insane.
You're insane.


1110
01:27:43.006 --> 01:27:44.417
Get back in the car, please.

1111
01:27:44.508 --> 01:27:46.170
Ignore him. One more time.

1112
01:27:53.683 --> 01:27:55.244
So is your brother coming tonight?

1113
01:27:55.268 --> 01:27:56.975
Yeah. Yeah, after prom.

1114
01:27:57.062 --> 01:27:58.982
At least he said he'd show up.

1115
01:28:01.900 --> 01:28:04.313
- Hold on, I gotta take this.
- Okay. No problem.


1116
01:28:06.404 --> 01:28:07.440
Hey, Mom.

1117
01:28:28.718 --> 01:28:30.175
What's his GCS?

1118
01:29:14.347 --> 01:29:17.368
<i>All units south of
Triphammer respond to a 413 vehicle crash</i>


1119
01:29:17.392 --> 01:29:18.678
<i>at Highland and Hampton.</i>

1120
01:29:18.768 --> 01:29:21.431
Officer Herman responding.
Three minutes out.


1121
01:29:21.521 --> 01:29:23.353
Goddamn prom night!

1122
01:29:23.440 --> 01:29:26.023
Every year.

1123
01:29:30.488 --> 01:29:32.195
And all of us at the library are

1124
01:29:32.282 --> 01:29:33.898
thrilled that he's here with us again.

1125
01:29:33.992 --> 01:29:37.485
So, without further ado,
Mr. John Kendall.


1126
01:29:52.802 --> 01:29:54.839
Will you get back
in the goddamn car!


1127
01:30:06.232 --> 01:30:09.100
<i>As children, we ask big questions</i>

1128
01:30:09.194 --> 01:30:10.776
<i>to try to make sense of the world.</i>

1129
01:30:12.489 --> 01:30:15.527
<i>As adults, we offer
answers without proof.</i>


1130
01:30:17.994 --> 01:30:21.988
<i>I now understand
there isn't any single answer.</i>


1131
01:30:23.124 --> 01:30:25.081
<i>We must all walk our own path,</i>

1132
01:30:25.961 --> 01:30:27.247
<i>and find our own truth.</i>

1133
01:30:29.923 --> 01:30:31.084
<i>But I figure,</i>

1134
01:30:32.384 --> 01:30:33.591
<i>if I go my way,</i>

1135
01:30:35.261 --> 01:30:36.342
<i>and you go yours,</i>

1136
01:30:38.682 --> 01:30:40.924
<i>we'll all wind up
in the same place in the end.</i>
