2
00:01:13.417 --> 00:01:15.583
I've destroyed all the evidence

3
00:01:15.584 --> 00:01:17.084
What can you do about it?

4
00:01:23.667 --> 00:01:25.625
I've destroyed all the evidence

5
00:01:25.626 --> 00:01:27.251
What can you do about it?

6
00:01:28.792 --> 00:01:32.375
You're arrested for tampering with evidence

7
00:01:33.209 --> 00:01:34.625
You son of a bitch

8
00:01:34.626 --> 00:01:35.584
Hand it over

9
00:01:35.584 --> 00:01:37.167
What are you doing? Let go

10
00:01:37.167 --> 00:01:37.958
Come on

11
00:01:37.959 --> 00:01:39.834
Where? I'm already in prison!

12
00:01:39.834 --> 00:01:42.500
Where can you take me? Let go!

13
00:01:42.834 --> 00:01:44.667
I'll see you in another cell

14
00:01:44.667 --> 00:01:46.250
Thank you, friendly inmate

15
00:01:46.251 --> 00:01:49.917
No, he's the Incarcerated Detective

16
00:01:50.251 --> 00:01:51.792
You're welcome

17
00:01:53.334 --> 00:01:55.167
Because justice...

18
00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:59.209
Will forever stand on the side of justice

Boss

00:02:14.251 --> 00:02:15.084
Thanks, Chow

22
00:02:15.084 --> 00:02:16.709
Let's work together

23
00:02:17.001 --> 00:02:18.626
Work together, okay?

24
00:02:19.042 --> 00:02:19.708
Thank you, boss

25
00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:21.209
Let's head to the bathhouse, my treat

26
00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:23.667
- I'm used to bathing myself
- I gotta work


27
00:02:23.667 --> 00:02:25.125
My car's here...

28
00:02:25.584 --> 00:02:27.125
- Bye-bye!
- Thank you, boss...


29
00:02:27.126 --> 00:02:27.792
Thank you, boss

30
00:02:27.792 --> 00:02:29.833
- We're in this together boss
- He's gone


31
00:02:32.376 --> 00:02:34.209
That bottle of red was horrible...

32
00:02:34.751 --> 00:02:36.251
Motherfucker

33
00:02:37.376 --> 00:02:38.792
That guy...

34
00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:41.667
So what does this mean?

35
00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:44.834
Lark, with you on board, it's gonna happen

36
00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:45.667
Right?

37
00:02:47.376 --> 00:02:48.709
Let me tell you

38
00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:50.709
I think the story is great

39
00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:53.459
I've been hoping to work with you

40
00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:54.375
Alright

41
00:02:54.376 --> 00:02:55.876
The director's right here

42
00:02:56.126 --> 00:02:56.876
Got it?

43
00:02:56.876 --> 00:02:58.209
Alright, supporting new directors

44
00:02:58.209 --> 00:02:59.709
I'll contact Jan and set up a meeting

45
00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:00.125
Thanks

46
00:03:00.126 --> 00:03:00.876
Set up a meeting...

47
00:03:01.042 --> 00:03:02.250
Set up...

48
00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:06.875
That's Lark, the Incarcerated Detective

49
00:03:06.876 --> 00:03:09.667
It's Lark... the Incarcerated Detective

50
00:03:09.667 --> 00:03:10.917
I love watching your show

51
00:03:10.917 --> 00:03:11.958
Hello there

52
00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:13.542
Can we take a picture with you?

53
00:03:13.542 --> 00:03:14.417
Sure... of course you can

54
00:03:14.417 --> 00:03:16.000
- You're so handsome
- Thanks


55
00:03:16.001 --> 00:03:16.917
Let me help you take a picture

56
00:03:16.917 --> 00:03:18.625
Alright, thank you

57
00:03:19.292 --> 00:03:21.333
1,2, 3...

58
00:03:21.334 --> 00:03:23.500
Let's do your signature pose

59
00:03:23.501 --> 00:03:24.792
Alright...

60
00:03:24.792 --> 00:03:26.292
Okay

61
00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:29.917
Alright, look here, 123

62
00:03:29.917 --> 00:03:31.500
Because justice...

63
00:03:31.501 --> 00:03:35.251
Will forever stand on the side of justice

64
00:03:46.876 --> 00:03:48.876
- I'm hungry
- There's a new noodle place nearby,


65
00:03:48.876 --> 00:03:51.126
- let's check it out
- Sure


66
00:03:56.709 --> 00:03:58.375
What the hell?

67
00:04:00.834 --> 00:04:01.584
Hey!

68
00:04:01.584 --> 00:04:04.084
Forget it, he must be drunk

69
00:04:04.084 --> 00:04:05.584
Be careful, he might hurt you

70
00:04:06.001 --> 00:04:09.417
Isn't he the Incarcerated Detective on TV?

71
00:04:09.417 --> 00:04:10.708
Who's that?

72
00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:12.459
That guy...

73
00:04:12.751 --> 00:04:13.751
I don't watch TV

74
00:04:13.751 --> 00:04:15.251
Let's go

75
00:04:24.792 --> 00:04:25.625
Hello?

76
00:04:25.626 --> 00:04:27.251
Are you still at dinner?

77
00:04:27.251 --> 00:04:29.334
Incarcerated Detective shoots tonight at 23:30

78
00:04:29.334 --> 00:04:31.792
Dinner's done, I'm on my way

79
00:04:31.792 --> 00:04:33.667
We wouldn't stay long, there weren't any girls

80
00:04:33.792 --> 00:04:36.500
We're shooting the episode with the female ghost

81
00:04:38.626 --> 00:04:40.459
So much weird shit is happening

82
00:04:40.459 --> 00:04:41.250
Long shooting hours

83
00:04:41.251 --> 00:04:42.542
Getting in the way of my movie deals

84
00:04:42.709 --> 00:04:43.459
You tell them

85
00:04:43.459 --> 00:04:45.542
I don't wanna be a fucking cop again

86
00:04:45.751 --> 00:04:47.959
Lark, just calm down a bit

87
00:04:47.959 --> 00:04:50.000
Are you drinking and driving?

88
00:04:50.084 --> 00:04:52.292
Be careful, you're a public figure

89
00:04:52.292 --> 00:04:54.333
It's a big deal if you get caught

90
00:04:54.376 --> 00:04:55.584
I won't

91
00:04:57.626 --> 00:04:59.584
Shit, I'll call you later

92
00:05:00.459 --> 00:05:01.500
Sir

93
00:05:01.501 --> 00:05:03.001
Sir?

94
00:05:03.501 --> 00:05:05.001
Do you know why I pulled you over?

95
00:05:05.917 --> 00:05:08.000
Why is that, sir?

96
00:05:10.042 --> 00:05:11.542
Because...

97
00:05:12.417 --> 00:05:15.250
Justice always stands on the side of justice

98
00:05:16.751 --> 00:05:17.459
Yes...

99
00:05:19.417 --> 00:05:21.500
Justice is always on the side of justice

100
00:05:21.834 --> 00:05:22.792
Can I take a selfie?

101
00:05:23.417 --> 00:05:25.667
Sure, of course you can

102
00:05:37.626 --> 00:05:39.126
Thank you

103
00:05:39.542 --> 00:05:40.792
Hold on

104
00:05:45.292 --> 00:05:46.792
You wanna leave just like that?

105
00:05:51.334 --> 00:05:52.584
Your seat belt

106
00:05:54.751 --> 00:05:56.459
Right... sorry, sir...

107
00:05:57.334 --> 00:06:00.875
Thank you... thank you, sir...

108
00:07:58.167 --> 00:07:59.875

111
00:09:04.459 --> 00:09:05.834
Ask the director what time we're getting off

112
00:09:05.834 --> 00:09:07.250
Why would you ask the AD?

113
00:09:11.709 --> 00:09:14.209
Stop shooting, are you paying for damages?

114
00:09:15.626 --> 00:09:17.626
Hurry up

115
00:09:20.501 --> 00:09:22.917
Change into the costumes for your next scene

116
00:09:30.626 --> 00:09:32.084
Hello director

117
00:09:36.626 --> 00:09:37.917
Brother Lark

118
00:09:38.917 --> 00:09:41.083
I'll work on your makeup later

119
00:09:58.876 --> 00:10:00.084
Lark!

120
00:10:00.084 --> 00:10:01.834
Good morning...

121
00:10:02.542 --> 00:10:04.083
I wanna apologize

122
00:10:04.084 --> 00:10:08.584
Jan said you had
some thoughts on the script

123
00:10:08.709 --> 00:10:09.959
But I've spoken to the writer

124
00:10:09.959 --> 00:10:12.667
We hope you can
compromise on the ghost element

125
00:10:12.667 --> 00:10:14.167
Because that affects the whole storyline

126
00:10:14.209 --> 00:10:16.000
Alright, sure, no problem

127
00:10:16.459 --> 00:10:17.875
Thank you, Lark...

128
00:10:17.876 --> 00:10:18.834
We're ready to go

129
00:10:18.834 --> 00:10:20.209
Let's go through the scene, okay?

130
00:10:20.209 --> 00:10:21.250
Thanks

131
00:10:23.667 --> 00:10:25.167
Thanks, Brother Lark

132
00:10:25.167 --> 00:10:26.292
Alright, we don't need to go through it

133
00:10:26.292 --> 00:10:28.958
Let's just leave it as is, 
I'm good with that

134
00:10:29.542 --> 00:10:30.583
We gotta go through it

135
00:10:30.584 --> 00:10:32.000
It's a very important scene

136
00:10:32.001 --> 00:10:33.042
Yeah it is

137
00:10:33.417 --> 00:10:34.958
Thank you, Brother Lark

138
00:10:37.167 --> 00:10:38.792
Jut put it up here

139
00:10:38.792 --> 00:10:40.167
Sure

140
00:10:41.042 --> 00:10:42.167
Position it better

141
00:10:43.001 --> 00:10:44.834
How can I read it if it's horizontal?

142
00:10:46.251 --> 00:10:47.584
Stop messing around, Lark

143
00:10:47.584 --> 00:10:48.459
You...

144
00:10:50.459 --> 00:10:52.125
Your hands...

145
00:10:52.876 --> 00:10:55.584
What the heck? 
Why is there fake blood?

146
00:10:55.584 --> 00:10:56.875
It's the wrong scene

147
00:10:56.876 --> 00:10:58.667
Let me talk to makeup

148
00:10:58.792 --> 00:11:00.500
It's okay, don't blame them

149
00:11:00.501 --> 00:11:01.292
No worries, it's okay

150
00:11:01.667 --> 00:11:02.500
Let's go through the scene

151
00:11:02.501 --> 00:11:03.417
Tell makeup not to come over

152
00:11:03.417 --> 00:11:05.542
Thanks, which part are we looking at?

153
00:11:05.542 --> 00:11:09.667
So the ghost is seeking
your help to find justice

154
00:11:09.751 --> 00:11:12.042
Then you slowly...

155
00:11:12.709 --> 00:11:14.584
Don't touch me, carry on

156
00:11:14.959 --> 00:11:17.125
You touch her chin

157
00:11:17.126 --> 00:11:18.792
And say, 'Don't worry..."

158
00:11:18.792 --> 00:11:20.250
And then your signature catchphrase

159
00:11:20.251 --> 00:11:21.751
Then I'll start adding mist

160
00:11:21.751 --> 00:11:22.584
What?

161
00:11:22.709 --> 00:11:24.209
- Your catchphrase
- Sure


162
00:11:24.209 --> 00:11:25.667
Then I'll add some mist

163
00:11:25.667 --> 00:11:27.208
To give it a mysterious ambiance

164
00:11:27.209 --> 00:11:28.834
Then the camera tracks in

165
00:11:28.834 --> 00:11:32.625
I'm actually referencing a film that I love

166
00:11:37.167 --> 00:11:39.250
Lark is on set

167
00:11:41.167 --> 00:11:43.417
Lark, this is your position marker

168
00:11:43.417 --> 00:11:45.125
When you say your lines...

169
00:11:45.292 --> 00:11:46.375
Are we ready?

170
00:11:46.376 --> 00:11:48.376
Let's go ahead and try one

171
00:11:48.751 --> 00:11:50.376
Try one? I can only do this once

172
00:11:50.376 --> 00:11:52.584
Sorry, I need to fix your mic

173
00:11:55.042 --> 00:11:57.708
Then let's go for it

174
00:11:57.709 --> 00:11:59.459
Let's shoot it for real

175
00:12:03.501 --> 00:12:04.917
Camera rolling

176
00:12:05.834 --> 00:12:08.125
And... action!

177
00:12:10.917 --> 00:12:15.417
Incarcerated Detective...

178
00:12:51.042 --> 00:12:55.542
I died in vain, 
I died horribly...

179
00:12:56.792 --> 00:12:58.292
Cut, that was amazing!

180
00:12:58.917 --> 00:13:01.250
But he hasn't said his catchphrase yet

181
00:13:02.334 --> 00:13:04.875
His expression was priceless though

182
00:13:05.251 --> 00:13:06.376
Let's do one more

183
00:13:07.834 --> 00:13:09.334
Where's Lark?

184
00:13:09.626 --> 00:13:10.667
He said he'd only do one take

185
00:13:10.667 --> 00:13:11.833
So that's the only take we'll get

186
00:13:11.834 --> 00:13:12.875
What?

187
00:14:17.459 --> 00:14:18.959
Lark...

188
00:14:23.084 --> 00:14:25.709
Lark, are you doing okay?

189
00:14:26.084 --> 00:14:28.167
We came in here
to talk to you about...

190
00:14:28.167 --> 00:14:29.583
Did you guys...

191
00:14:29.584 --> 00:14:31.959
See the female ghost just now?

192
00:14:33.417 --> 00:14:36.667
The female ghost... she's ready to roll

193
00:14:37.001 --> 00:14:39.209
She's a real ghost

194
00:14:41.251 --> 00:14:43.417
I hired her, she's called Ceci

195
00:14:43.417 --> 00:14:44.750
She's looks very convincing

196
00:14:44.751 --> 00:14:46.667
That's because she's a real ghost

197
00:14:46.667 --> 00:14:49.125
I just saw her neck... she...

198
00:14:49.126 --> 00:14:52.667
It went like... crack... snap...

199
00:14:57.459 --> 00:14:58.750
Lark

200
00:14:58.751 --> 00:15:00.834
Didn't you say you'd stay off booze?

201
00:15:00.834 --> 00:15:02.334
Yeah, Lark

202
00:15:02.334 --> 00:15:04.667
You shouldn't be drinking while you work

203
00:15:04.667 --> 00:15:06.792
The Incarcerated Detective is sober

204
00:15:06.792 --> 00:15:09.375
I'm not drunk, she's a real ghost

205
00:15:09.376 --> 00:15:11.959
I would know because I
ran my car into her

206
00:15:18.501 --> 00:15:21.376
Considering this scene,
using a ghost as an actress


207
00:15:21.376 --> 00:15:23.292
Is perfect casting, isn't it?

208
00:15:23.292 --> 00:15:24.792
Yeah

209
00:15:25.001 --> 00:15:26.792
It's okay, that's not important

210
00:15:26.792 --> 00:15:28.458
Let's get down to business

211
00:15:28.459 --> 00:15:29.709
Because that scene just now

212
00:15:29.709 --> 00:15:30.834
Was missing something

213
00:15:30.834 --> 00:15:32.375
We wanted you to say your catchphrase

214
00:15:32.376 --> 00:15:33.876
I'll ask the director to come out

215
00:15:34.459 --> 00:15:35.542
Director, excuse me

216
00:15:35.542 --> 00:15:36.375
The cameras are in position

217
00:15:36.376 --> 00:15:37.626
Let's go through it outside?

218
00:15:37.626 --> 00:15:39.667
Lark, let's walk and talk

219
00:15:39.667 --> 00:15:41.458
Because this is a very important scene

220
00:15:41.459 --> 00:15:43.334
Lark, we can eat after shooting this scene

221
00:15:43.334 --> 00:15:44.334
Come on

222
00:15:48.001 --> 00:15:49.501
Lark, thank you

223
00:15:51.751 --> 00:15:53.959
Lark, here's your marker

224
00:15:56.626 --> 00:15:58.292
Alright, let's go

225
00:16:00.084 --> 00:16:01.959
Quiet on set

226
00:16:03.917 --> 00:16:06.583
Give me back my head

227
00:16:06.584 --> 00:16:08.834
Quiet! Who's talking?

228
00:16:10.876 --> 00:16:13.209
Nobody's talking

229
00:16:17.417 --> 00:16:19.208
Never mind, let's do it

230
00:16:19.209 --> 00:16:22.584
Alright, quiet on set, do not talk

231
00:16:22.834 --> 00:16:24.334
Wait...

232
00:16:24.626 --> 00:16:25.834
Wait a second

233
00:16:26.751 --> 00:16:28.251
What's happening?

234
00:16:28.417 --> 00:16:30.125
Camera's down, let's call it a day

235
00:16:30.126 --> 00:16:31.626
We're good to go

236
00:16:32.209 --> 00:16:33.709
Alright, let's go again

237
00:16:34.584 --> 00:16:36.084
Sound speed

238
00:16:36.167 --> 00:16:39.333
Alright, 3... 2.. Action

239
00:16:41.917 --> 00:16:43.875
Detective...

240
00:16:45.334 --> 00:16:48.834
Can you help me?

241
00:16:50.917 --> 00:16:53.500
Help me...

242
00:16:59.251 --> 00:17:01.251
What's going on?

243
00:17:01.251 --> 00:17:02.751
- Turn them back on...
- Was there a proper blessing ceremony?


244
00:17:02.751 --> 00:17:05.251
Director is losing his temper

245
00:17:05.417 --> 00:17:08.958
Did the generator run out of fuel?

246
00:17:08.959 --> 00:17:10.750
Someone go check it out

247
00:17:11.876 --> 00:17:14.001
We're good to go, director

248
00:17:15.834 --> 00:17:18.667
Director, let's do it again

249
00:17:50.209 --> 00:17:53.875
Director, are we doing it again

250
00:17:57.334 --> 00:18:01.042
Get out of my way... shut the door...

251
00:18:01.042 --> 00:18:03.500
I told you, she's a real ghost

252
00:18:04.501 --> 00:18:06.626
She's a real ghost, are we still shooting?

253
00:18:07.709 --> 00:18:09.209
Shut up

254
00:18:09.459 --> 00:18:11.250
What should we do now, director?

255
00:18:11.251 --> 00:18:13.626
Let's wrap and get out of here

256
00:18:15.584 --> 00:18:18.042
This is our last day on this location,
otherwise we'll lose it


257
00:18:18.292 --> 00:18:19.917
There still enough time

258
00:18:19.917 --> 00:18:22.208
Let's just get an extra to replace her

259
00:18:22.209 --> 00:18:24.625
What? What about continuity?

260
00:18:25.709 --> 00:18:26.917
Right, continuity should be good

261
00:18:26.917 --> 00:18:29.292
Why did you hire a
real ghost to come to work?

262
00:18:29.292 --> 00:18:32.125
Sorry, I didn't know

263
00:18:32.251 --> 00:18:33.376
We're only missing the ending, director

264
00:18:33.376 --> 00:18:35.751
Let's just get it over with

265
00:18:36.459 --> 00:18:37.709
I'll give you priority on my schedule

266
00:18:37.709 --> 00:18:38.625
Let's just stop shooting now

267
00:18:38.626 --> 00:18:39.251
What?

268
00:18:39.251 --> 00:18:41.792
I'm scared

269
00:18:45.376 --> 00:18:47.334
Director...

270
00:18:47.667 --> 00:18:49.958
Don't replace me

271
00:18:52.876 --> 00:18:54.876
Don't replace me

272
00:18:54.876 --> 00:18:56.376
Director...

273
00:19:06.459 --> 00:19:07.959
Let's keep shooting

274
00:19:09.167 --> 00:19:10.708
Are you okay?

275
00:19:13.251 --> 00:19:14.876
Do you still have humanity left in you?

276
00:19:14.876 --> 00:19:18.292
She was ran over
on her way to work

277
00:19:18.292 --> 00:19:21.750
She wants to finish her job
even though she's a ghost


278
00:19:21.751 --> 00:19:25.292
Isn't that the true Hong Konger spirit?

279
00:19:28.876 --> 00:19:32.292
As long as we
work together alongside each other

280
00:19:32.751 --> 00:19:34.667
And influence a life with a life

281
00:19:34.667 --> 00:19:37.750
A priceless collaboration
between humans and ghosts


282
00:19:37.751 --> 00:19:39.334
I believe that...

283
00:19:39.334 --> 00:19:43.042
We can create something that
is heart-stirring for the audience


284
00:19:43.459 --> 00:19:45.750
Do you know what the fuck you're saying?

285
00:19:47.501 --> 00:19:49.292
She was in a car accident

286
00:19:49.292 --> 00:19:51.917
She still showed up right on time

287
00:19:51.917 --> 00:19:53.833
Right

288
00:19:53.834 --> 00:19:58.334
She doesn't need makeup, that's good right?

289
00:19:59.626 --> 00:20:03.501
She won't go to the great beyond
if her heart still lingers on


290
00:20:04.084 --> 00:20:06.209
She's a fine actress

291
00:20:06.917 --> 00:20:10.708
We can't strip her chance away
just because she's a ghost


292
00:20:10.709 --> 00:20:14.542
It just so happens we need
a character that's a ghost


293
00:20:14.542 --> 00:20:18.250
Why can't we hire a ghost
as an actor for this role?


294
00:20:18.251 --> 00:20:20.042
Why do we always have
to put someone in makeup?

295
00:20:20.917 --> 00:20:23.708
That's incredibly unfair to ghosts

296
00:20:27.251 --> 00:20:29.376
Right, you have a point

297
00:20:30.501 --> 00:20:31.751
That makes sense

298
00:20:33.251 --> 00:20:35.501
Awesome, we'll have a
market in hell as well!

299
00:20:38.584 --> 00:20:40.084
Wait a second...

300
00:20:40.292 --> 00:20:42.000
Are you guys out of your mind?

301
00:20:42.167 --> 00:20:43.583
She's a ghost!

302
00:20:43.584 --> 00:20:46.042
You guys are letting a
ghost work on your show?

303
00:20:47.376 --> 00:20:50.084
Maybe she's here to seek revenge on me

304
00:20:51.876 --> 00:20:54.126
Don't you even think about ghost busting

305
00:20:54.126 --> 00:20:56.167
Just focus on your acting

306
00:20:57.876 --> 00:21:00.501
I think Ceci is
perfectly cast for the role

307
00:21:00.501 --> 00:21:02.001
I'm okay with that

308
00:21:03.084 --> 00:21:04.584
Wait for me

309
00:21:05.751 --> 00:21:09.334
She's overwhelmed with sorrow, and she's a pro

310
00:21:10.001 --> 00:21:12.334
She didn't follow the script,
she's not a pro at all


311
00:21:12.334 --> 00:21:13.959
You missed a few lines

312
00:21:13.959 --> 00:21:15.500
Don't talk to me about being 'pro'

313
00:21:15.501 --> 00:21:17.584
Makeup heading to set...

314
00:21:20.542 --> 00:21:23.375
We'll work on her
performance once we're on set

315
00:21:24.876 --> 00:21:28.876
You too, don't stay here

316
00:21:33.126 --> 00:21:35.251
You bunch of jerks

317
00:21:36.376 --> 00:21:40.459
Thank you for letting me
act with you, my saviour

318
00:21:47.667 --> 00:21:48.500
Alright!

319
00:21:48.501 --> 00:21:51.001
We're just missing the ending, let's finish this

320
00:21:51.834 --> 00:21:52.500
Brother Lark

321
00:21:52.501 --> 00:21:55.417
In this scene,
an inmate will charge at you with a shiv


322
00:21:55.417 --> 00:21:57.917
Luckily, the female ghost will
help you apprehend him


323
00:21:58.084 --> 00:21:59.000
Where's the inmate?

324
00:21:59.001 --> 00:22:00.792
Sorry, the inmate is coming

325
00:22:03.459 --> 00:22:04.750
I'm here

326
00:22:04.751 --> 00:22:05.626
You again?

327
00:22:05.626 --> 00:22:06.876
We're lacking budget

328
00:22:06.876 --> 00:22:07.917
Whatever

329
00:22:07.917 --> 00:22:09.333
Director

330
00:22:09.334 --> 00:22:11.125
Ceci, come and rehearse the scene

331
00:22:11.376 --> 00:22:11.876
Come on...

332
00:22:15.626 --> 00:22:16.542
Screw it

333
00:22:16.542 --> 00:22:18.042
Let's just do this

334
00:22:20.001 --> 00:22:22.001
Good, it's almost sunrise

335
00:22:22.001 --> 00:22:23.126
Ceci will have to go

336
00:22:23.126 --> 00:22:24.542
Alright, let's go for it

337
00:22:27.542 --> 00:22:29.000
Ready, and action

338
00:22:29.126 --> 00:22:30.834
Because justice will forever
stand on the side of justice


339
00:22:37.334 --> 00:22:38.834
Sorry, Lark

340
00:22:39.001 --> 00:22:41.001
Get off me, asshole

341
00:22:41.001 --> 00:22:42.001
Sorry

342
00:22:46.376 --> 00:22:48.376
Are you okay?

343
00:22:48.376 --> 00:22:50.709
- Are you bleeding?
- Don't touch me


344
00:22:50.709 --> 00:22:52.750
Are you injured anywhere?

345
00:22:52.751 --> 00:22:56.834
Go slower, give him time
to get out of the way

346
00:22:56.834 --> 00:22:58.250
Director

347
00:22:59.042 --> 00:23:01.500
Sorry, it's my first
time shooting an action scene

348
00:23:01.501 --> 00:23:03.167
I'm still inexperienced, I'm sorry

349
00:23:03.167 --> 00:23:06.125
This scene is very dangerous, let's change it

350
00:23:06.376 --> 00:23:08.001
Change it?

351
00:23:08.001 --> 00:23:12.376
Director, perhaps I should stop
the shiv with my body


352
00:23:14.459 --> 00:23:16.417
Using your body to shop the shiv?

353
00:23:16.417 --> 00:23:19.083
Director, this is real stuff

354
00:23:19.626 --> 00:23:21.126
It's real

355
00:23:23.876 --> 00:23:25.251
I can do it

356
00:23:27.501 --> 00:23:29.959
Alright, let's try one

357
00:23:34.751 --> 00:23:39.251
Because justice will forever
stand on the side of justice


358
00:23:48.042 --> 00:23:48.958
Director

359
00:23:48.959 --> 00:23:50.459
How was that?

360
00:23:50.501 --> 00:23:52.084
There isn't enough blood

361
00:23:52.084 --> 00:23:53.584
Not enough blood?

362
00:23:53.709 --> 00:23:55.417
Sorry, let's go again

363
00:24:02.042 --> 00:24:03.542
Stab harder

364
00:24:06.001 --> 00:24:07.501
Are you even trying?

365
00:24:11.959 --> 00:24:13.667
Let's try different angles

366
00:24:13.667 --> 00:24:14.750
Alright

367
00:24:17.834 --> 00:24:21.167
Ceci, you're gonna float into the scene

368
00:24:27.751 --> 00:24:29.542
Ceci, come down, 
I need to check your mic

369
00:24:35.209 --> 00:24:37.250
This is great, just stay like this

370
00:24:37.251 --> 00:24:38.042
Thank you

371
00:24:40.001 --> 00:24:41.209
Be careful

372
00:24:44.834 --> 00:24:47.667
We have to take care of our actors

373
00:24:57.834 --> 00:24:59.167
Director

374
00:24:59.167 --> 00:24:59.958
Is this okay?

375
00:24:59.959 --> 00:25:01.459
Let's try it like this

376
00:25:01.459 --> 00:25:04.375
Right... that's great

377
00:25:04.376 --> 00:25:05.542
Steve, get over here

378
00:25:05.542 --> 00:25:07.542
- We're almost ready
- Alright


379
00:25:07.542 --> 00:25:08.500
You're here

380
00:25:08.501 --> 00:25:10.667
Then we'll do a close up right here

381
00:25:10.667 --> 00:25:15.083
I want some flesh to still be
attached to the bone on her neck


382
00:25:22.501 --> 00:25:25.417
Help me, these guys are insane

383
00:25:25.417 --> 00:25:27.583
Where are you? 
Why didn't you pick up the phone?

384
00:25:27.584 --> 00:25:29.334
I'm shooting right now

385
00:25:29.917 --> 00:25:30.958
What is there to shoot?

386
00:25:30.959 --> 00:25:33.334
What else? 'The Incarcerated Detective'

387
00:25:33.334 --> 00:25:34.875
What? Haven't you heard the news?

388
00:25:35.084 --> 00:25:36.500
The whole crew was in a traffic accident

389
00:25:36.501 --> 00:25:38.751
Their car tumbled down
the side of a mountain

390
00:26:54.417 --> 00:26:55.667
Lark...

391
00:26:55.667 --> 00:26:56.958
Don't leave...

392
00:26:56.959 --> 00:27:01.459
You have to keep shooting...

393
00:27:02.251 --> 00:27:06.417
Lark... we still have two scenes left

394
00:27:22.667 --> 00:27:26.125
Lark... don't leave...

395
00:27:26.376 --> 00:27:29.209
Don't drink and drive

396
00:27:30.876 --> 00:27:33.251
Wear your seat belt

397
00:27:33.709 --> 00:27:36.334
Lark... don't leave...

398
00:27:36.334 --> 00:27:37.917
Don't drink and drive

399
00:27:54.834 --> 00:27:56.042
Sir

400
00:27:58.001 --> 00:27:59.334
Get out of the car

401
00:28:00.042 --> 00:28:01.250
Get in the car

402
00:28:01.251 --> 00:28:03.209
We're gonna administer a breathalyzer test

403
00:28:03.417 --> 00:28:04.958
I didn't drink

404
00:28:05.501 --> 00:28:06.792
You have to do it
even if you didn't drink

405
00:28:06.792 --> 00:28:08.292
Get lost, for fuck sake

406
00:28:10.292 --> 00:28:12.458
Lark, of 'The Incarcerated Detective' fame

407
00:28:12.459 --> 00:28:14.375
Was involved in a traffic collision last month

408
00:28:14.376 --> 00:28:16.792
He's always showed up to work drunk

409
00:28:16.792 --> 00:28:19.125
This incident almost halted
production on the series


410
00:28:19.126 --> 00:28:21.751
Luckily, the studio found a replacement

411
00:28:21.751 --> 00:28:23.251
According to our sources

412
00:28:23.251 --> 00:28:26.001
Lark's mental health is
deteriorating inside prison


413
00:28:26.001 --> 00:28:28.376
Perhaps it's the impact
of losing a precious role

414
00:28:28.376 --> 00:28:29.626
He's been troubled by hallucinations

415
00:28:29.626 --> 00:28:31.834
Saying that a bunch of ghosts
are forcing him to shoot


416
00:28:31.834 --> 00:28:35.375
We wish Brother Lark the best of health

417
00:28:46.709 --> 00:28:48.292
Hurry up

418
00:28:53.459 --> 00:28:55.209
Fucking hell

419
00:28:55.376 --> 00:28:57.417
I've destroyed all the evidence

420
00:28:57.417 --> 00:28:59.125
What are you gonna do about it?

421
00:29:03.584 --> 00:29:05.584
I've destroyed all the evidence

422
00:29:05.584 --> 00:29:07.042
What are you gonna do about it?

423
00:29:08.167 --> 00:29:10.500
You're arrested with tampering of evidence

424
00:29:11.834 --> 00:29:13.167
Thank you, friendly inmate

425
00:29:13.167 --> 00:29:15.417
No, she's the Incarcerated Female Detective

426
00:29:15.417 --> 00:29:17.042
No... that can't be...

427
00:29:17.542 --> 00:29:18.917
Get out of the way...

428
00:29:18.917 --> 00:29:22.833
What are you doing? Asshole!

429
00:29:23.126 --> 00:29:24.251
Get lost

430
00:29:24.251 --> 00:29:25.751
I'll show you guys

431
00:29:25.751 --> 00:29:28.709
Justice... will forever
stand on the side of... justice...


432
00:29:29.751 --> 00:29:31.251
Justice...

433
00:29:33.834 --> 00:29:35.750
I'm gonna bust your head wide open

434
00:29:36.667 --> 00:29:38.333
Gonna beat the shit out of you

435
00:29:38.417 --> 00:29:39.917
You're in the way of the TV

436
00:29:41.417 --> 00:29:42.458
Fucking ridiculous

437
00:29:43.167 --> 00:29:45.250
Detective? Aren't you the detective?

438
00:29:45.251 --> 00:29:47.459
What's going on? 
Sit the hell down

439
00:29:48.126 --> 00:29:49.167
Let's get outta here

440
00:29:57.959 --> 00:29:59.667
Because justice...

441
00:30:01.334 --> 00:30:04.792
Will forever stand on the side of justice

442
00:30:08.084 --> 00:30:11.250
"The Incarcerated Female Detective, Episode 1"

443
00:30:36.209 --> 00:30:38.292
"Cute Wife, Obey Me Tonight"

444
00:31:11.167 --> 00:31:12.042
What are you looking at?

445
00:31:25.459 --> 00:31:26.500
Good morning, have you eaten yet?

446
00:31:26.501 --> 00:31:28.001
Fatso, don't go in

447
00:31:28.084 --> 00:31:29.209
What happened?

448
00:31:29.501 --> 00:31:32.209
There's a pervert in there

449
00:31:32.209 --> 00:31:33.750
There are two perverts here

450
00:31:33.751 --> 00:31:35.876
He's a gay pervert

451
00:31:37.751 --> 00:31:40.126
I must correct you

452
00:31:40.751 --> 00:31:42.292
Do you know what place this is?

453
00:31:42.292 --> 00:31:43.458
Male toilet

454
00:31:43.459 --> 00:31:45.459
It's a public toilet

455
00:31:45.459 --> 00:31:47.459
Do you know what that means?

456
00:31:47.626 --> 00:31:49.626
Anyone can go in and
out of a public toilet

457
00:31:49.626 --> 00:31:51.251
Free entry, equal amongst all

458
00:31:51.251 --> 00:31:53.251
It's a place of freedom

459
00:31:53.251 --> 00:31:54.959
But that pervert was looking at my dick

460
00:31:54.959 --> 00:31:57.167
I just don't want the
same to happen to you

461
00:31:58.001 --> 00:31:59.334
Kwan

462
00:31:59.334 --> 00:32:00.792
Are you from this era?

463
00:32:01.167 --> 00:32:03.625
How can your values be so backwards?

464
00:32:03.626 --> 00:32:06.292
Your words are discriminatory

465
00:32:07.751 --> 00:32:08.751
Are you homophobic?

466
00:32:08.751 --> 00:32:10.459
I'm not homophobic

467
00:32:10.459 --> 00:32:13.584
I just don't want that
gay guy to mess with me

468
00:32:13.917 --> 00:32:17.125
Some might say that you're
discriminating their sexuality


469
00:32:17.126 --> 00:32:19.501
You might get sued
and end up in prison

470
00:32:20.334 --> 00:32:21.709
Where you'll be raped

471
00:32:23.959 --> 00:32:25.459
I'm going to pee

472
00:32:32.501 --> 00:32:33.459
Thank you

473
00:32:33.459 --> 00:32:34.959
Admiralty, please

474
00:32:36.251 --> 00:32:37.792
I'm not crossing the harbour, sorry

475
00:32:37.792 --> 00:32:39.625
I'm changing shifts

476
00:32:39.626 --> 00:32:41.626
- Get another cab
- Alright


477
00:32:41.626 --> 00:32:43.126
Damn taxi dog

478
00:32:43.251 --> 00:32:45.126
What do you mean? 
What did you just say?

479
00:32:45.126 --> 00:32:47.834
If I'm a taxi
dog then what are you?

480
00:32:47.834 --> 00:32:50.000
What are you? You're a harbour crossing dog

481
00:32:50.001 --> 00:32:52.084
What? Come at me

482
00:32:52.084 --> 00:32:53.542
You didn't even shut the door

483
00:32:53.626 --> 00:32:56.209
I think he's just busy

484
00:32:56.209 --> 00:32:58.000
He'll call you back later

485
00:32:58.001 --> 00:33:00.959
I'm not asking him
to drive an expensive car

486
00:33:00.959 --> 00:33:04.167
I just want someone to drive me home
when I'm tipsy


487
00:33:04.626 --> 00:33:06.334
Is that too much to ask?

488
00:33:06.334 --> 00:33:08.417
Look at the three
of us, at rock bottom

489
00:33:08.792 --> 00:33:11.750
Nah, mine's just not free tonight

490
00:33:11.751 --> 00:33:14.792
That's an excuse,
what could he be doing at this hour?


491
00:33:15.459 --> 00:33:18.084
Rose's boyfriend treats her well

492
00:33:18.084 --> 00:33:19.584
For her birthday last year

493
00:33:19.584 --> 00:33:22.042
They went on a staycation at the Peninsula

494
00:33:22.251 --> 00:33:23.626
Right, I've been to many of Hong Kong's

495
00:33:23.626 --> 00:33:26.167
5-star hotels for a staycation

496
00:33:26.167 --> 00:33:29.125
There's a buffet, a spa, it's amazing

497
00:33:29.126 --> 00:33:30.167
The buffet is included?

498
00:33:30.167 --> 00:33:31.667
Yeah, you didn't know?

499
00:33:33.626 --> 00:33:36.459
I... really wanna try it out as well

500
00:33:36.459 --> 00:33:37.542
Let me ask you

501
00:33:37.542 --> 00:33:40.167
Is a boyfriend who takes you
on a staycation more important


502
00:33:40.167 --> 00:33:41.750
Or a boyfriend who drives you home?

503
00:33:41.751 --> 00:33:43.084
Of course it's the staycation

504
00:33:43.084 --> 00:33:44.542
Who'd know if he drove me home

505
00:33:44.542 --> 00:33:45.875
But if it's a staycation

506
00:33:45.876 --> 00:33:46.917
The whole world would know

507
00:33:46.917 --> 00:33:49.083
Take a few pics,
post them online, that's awesome

508
00:33:49.417 --> 00:33:50.875
Wait a minute, speaking of which

509
00:33:50.876 --> 00:33:53.959
Ling, you've been dating your
boyfriend for two years now


510
00:33:53.959 --> 00:33:56.167
How come we've never met him?

511
00:33:57.417 --> 00:33:59.333
It's okay, you guys are such "mean girls'

512
00:33:59.751 --> 00:34:01.209
You guys are getting off soon

513
00:34:02.126 --> 00:34:03.459
Here's for the ride

514
00:34:03.459 --> 00:34:04.750
Don't worry about it

515
00:34:04.751 --> 00:34:06.251
What do you mean?

516
00:34:06.542 --> 00:34:07.833
Stop it! Take it, bitch

517
00:34:07.834 --> 00:34:09.667
Just take it, you don't earn much anyway

518
00:34:09.667 --> 00:34:11.875
Driver, you can drop
me off around the corner

519
00:34:19.834 --> 00:34:20.542
Bye-bye

520
00:34:20.542 --> 00:34:21.708
See you next time, bye-bye

521
00:34:21.709 --> 00:34:23.209
See you next time

522
00:34:30.126 --> 00:34:31.542
What's up?

523
00:34:31.876 --> 00:34:33.459
Are you gonna come sit up front?

524
00:34:34.501 --> 00:34:36.417
Afraid that your friends will see you

525
00:34:40.667 --> 00:34:41.583
What is this?

526
00:34:41.584 --> 00:34:43.417
It's yours

527
00:34:46.084 --> 00:34:49.167
Is driving a taxi illegal?

528
00:34:50.376 --> 00:34:51.876
Can you not be so sensitive?

529
00:34:51.876 --> 00:34:53.459
You don't even know where your problem lies

530
00:34:54.501 --> 00:34:55.834
It's late, and I show up on demand

531
00:34:55.834 --> 00:34:57.292
Is that my problem?

532
00:34:57.542 --> 00:35:00.000
Your friends just called me a driver

533
00:35:00.001 --> 00:35:01.376
And that's my problem?

534
00:35:01.376 --> 00:35:03.876
What else would they call you?

535
00:35:05.001 --> 00:35:06.417
You came to pick me up

536
00:35:06.417 --> 00:35:07.625
You just wanted to
drive me to your place

537
00:35:07.626 --> 00:35:09.126
So that we can have sex

538
00:35:09.292 --> 00:35:13.083
Can you honestly remember
the last time we had sex?


539
00:35:14.417 --> 00:35:16.125
What do you see me as?

540
00:35:16.459 --> 00:35:18.375
How long has it been
since you came to my place?

541
00:35:20.459 --> 00:35:22.000
Because having sex in that shit hole

542
00:35:22.001 --> 00:35:23.751
Makes me feel like a whore

543
00:35:23.751 --> 00:35:25.792
It feels terrible

544
00:35:26.292 --> 00:35:28.208
I never treated you like one

545
00:35:30.334 --> 00:35:32.334
Being together with you...

546
00:35:33.376 --> 00:35:36.042
Besides getting free taxi rides

547
00:35:36.042 --> 00:35:38.667
I don't know what else
I can get from this

548
00:35:38.667 --> 00:35:41.167
I can't see a future in our relationship

549
00:35:44.376 --> 00:35:45.876
Are you crying again?

550
00:35:48.459 --> 00:35:51.917
Forget it, I don't
wanna mess up your taxi

551
00:35:52.751 --> 00:35:54.251
I'm leaving

552
00:36:00.667 --> 00:36:01.875
Hey!

553
00:36:01.876 --> 00:36:03.376
Ling Nai Yiu

554
00:36:03.751 --> 00:36:06.584
I'll drive you home, no sex tonight

555
00:36:07.834 --> 00:36:09.500
Alright then...

556
00:36:09.917 --> 00:36:13.375
I'll take you to your s... "location"!

557
00:36:19.834 --> 00:36:21.834
Your majesty...

558
00:36:22.042 --> 00:36:24.500
Unravel my clothing

559
00:36:24.501 --> 00:36:27.001
Remove all that I'm wearing

560
00:36:27.834 --> 00:36:29.167
Isn't that slutty?

561
00:36:29.167 --> 00:36:31.500
She's sexually autonomous, not slutty,
let's have a look


562
00:36:31.501 --> 00:36:32.751
Wait a second

563
00:36:32.751 --> 00:36:34.667
It's my turn to read that one

564
00:36:34.917 --> 00:36:37.167
Remember to return it

565
00:36:37.251 --> 00:36:40.626
Kwan, where's my copy of
'The Maiden Who Married into a Poor Family'?


566
00:36:44.417 --> 00:36:46.458
It's with you

567
00:36:48.084 --> 00:36:50.167
What are you looking at?

568
00:36:50.167 --> 00:36:53.875
5-star hotels, with spas and a buffet

569
00:36:53.876 --> 00:36:55.542
That's 4 - 5 grand

570
00:36:56.542 --> 00:36:59.250
What a good deal...

571
00:37:02.001 --> 00:37:03.584
My girlfriend wants to go on a staycation

572
00:37:06.001 --> 00:37:07.667
Kwan, are you out of your mind?

573
00:37:07.709 --> 00:37:09.584
4 - 5 grand so you
can book a room to have sex?

574
00:37:09.584 --> 00:37:11.084
Is your girlfriend made of gold?

575
00:37:11.292 --> 00:37:12.708
Not exactly

576
00:37:12.709 --> 00:37:14.709
But she has an amazing body

577
00:37:14.959 --> 00:37:18.167
Kwan, you don't need
to treat women too well

578
00:37:18.167 --> 00:37:19.208
I don't?

579
00:37:20.001 --> 00:37:21.459
Do you?

580
00:37:21.584 --> 00:37:23.084
I don't?

581
00:37:23.209 --> 00:37:24.500
Master

582
00:37:24.501 --> 00:37:27.001
Do you have the talisman from last time?

583
00:37:28.209 --> 00:37:30.250
Yeah I do, wait a second

584
00:37:31.126 --> 00:37:33.876
I got you a talisman, wait a second

585
00:37:39.417 --> 00:37:40.208
Alright

586
00:37:40.709 --> 00:37:44.959
When you get to your car,
put this on your forehead


587
00:37:44.959 --> 00:37:47.250
Keep walking straight,
it symbolizes a roof over your head


588
00:37:47.251 --> 00:37:48.542
Understood?

589
00:37:48.542 --> 00:37:49.792
Take this

590
00:37:51.792 --> 00:37:54.625
- Thank you, master...
- Store this well


591
00:37:54.626 --> 00:37:55.876
Here, don't let go

592
00:37:55.876 --> 00:37:57.709
I'm leaving, thank you

593
00:37:57.709 --> 00:37:59.584
Don't look back

594
00:38:03.001 --> 00:38:05.501
Did you pick that thing up
from the village ancestral hall?


595
00:38:06.167 --> 00:38:08.625
What? I just imbued a magical charm
into that item


596
00:38:08.626 --> 00:38:10.334
Didn't you see that?

597
00:38:10.334 --> 00:38:11.750
Do you want me
to make one for you?

598
00:38:11.751 --> 00:38:14.459
Yeah, Kwan, it really works

599
00:38:14.459 --> 00:38:16.625
It helped fight off some weird shit

600
00:38:16.626 --> 00:38:18.126
Sure thing

601
00:38:18.376 --> 00:38:20.751
It's okay, I'll pick it up
from the ancestral hall myself


602
00:38:22.209 --> 00:38:24.167
Are you messing with me?

603
00:38:26.542 --> 00:38:28.958
Ads for a staycation?

604
00:38:29.417 --> 00:38:31.667
They're listening to what we're saying

605
00:38:31.667 --> 00:38:33.167
I'm used to it

606
00:38:33.709 --> 00:38:34.834
I'm not afraid of them listening in

607
00:38:34.834 --> 00:38:36.500
I live an honest life, 
I don't really care

608
00:38:36.501 --> 00:38:37.792
Not for me, though

609
00:38:37.792 --> 00:38:40.000
"Red Rum Party House
Come here for a couple's staycation now!"


610
00:38:40.001 --> 00:38:43.001
"Haunted Industrial Building"

611
00:39:07.376 --> 00:39:08.876
Fucking hell

612
00:39:08.876 --> 00:39:10.876
Why did you throw my comic book?

613
00:39:10.876 --> 00:39:12.292
It's damaged now

614
00:39:12.292 --> 00:39:13.792
Is it yours?

615
00:39:13.959 --> 00:39:16.125
Do you know what you're reading?

616
00:39:16.334 --> 00:39:17.084
Whatever you're reading

617
00:39:17.084 --> 00:39:20.792
Defies the traditional Chinese values
of man and wife


618
00:39:20.792 --> 00:39:21.667
You can read it by yourself

619
00:39:21.667 --> 00:39:22.708
But you're putting it out in the open

620
00:39:22.709 --> 00:39:25.209
You're promotic toxic ideologies

621
00:39:28.709 --> 00:39:30.042
What's happening?

622
00:39:31.084 --> 00:39:33.000
You're a 'tsundere'

623
00:39:33.626 --> 00:39:34.917
What does that mean?

624
00:39:34.917 --> 00:39:36.417
What are you saying?

625
00:39:36.417 --> 00:39:37.625
This is nonsense

626
00:39:37.626 --> 00:39:39.126
Follow me in here

627
00:39:40.042 --> 00:39:42.250
Come on, 'tsundere'

628
00:39:43.209 --> 00:39:45.000
What does that mean?

629
00:39:45.584 --> 00:39:48.667
This is your room

630
00:39:50.626 --> 00:39:53.459
There are board games, mahjong, sofa bed

631
00:39:53.459 --> 00:39:55.125
Chairs, a table, a TV

632
00:39:55.126 --> 00:39:56.542
Ask me if you need an HDMI cable

633
00:39:56.542 --> 00:39:57.875
This place has a central a/c

634
00:39:57.917 --> 00:39:59.167
If you're ordering food, this is room C

635
00:39:59.167 --> 00:40:00.750
The address is on the WhatsApp confirmation

636
00:40:00.751 --> 00:40:02.251
You can't move the furniture around

637
00:40:02.251 --> 00:40:03.834
If you have decorations,
make sure you clear them out


638
00:40:03.834 --> 00:40:05.375
No double-sided tape on the wall

639
00:40:05.376 --> 00:40:07.126
You can't use spray paint, no durian

640
00:40:07.126 --> 00:40:08.334
No sexual intercourse, no hotpot

641
00:40:08.334 --> 00:40:09.417
- What?
- No smoking...


642
00:40:09.417 --> 00:40:10.542
What?

643
00:40:11.334 --> 00:40:13.000
No sex?

644
00:40:13.292 --> 00:40:15.417
No, why not?

645
00:40:15.459 --> 00:40:17.584
Say all that stuff again

646
00:40:17.959 --> 00:40:19.292
You can't move the furniture around

647
00:40:19.292 --> 00:40:20.708
If you have decorations,
make sure you clear them out


648
00:40:20.709 --> 00:40:21.959
No double-sided tape on the wall

649
00:40:21.959 --> 00:40:23.459
You can't use spray paint, no durian

650
00:40:23.459 --> 00:40:24.292
No sexual intercourse, no...

651
00:40:24.292 --> 00:40:25.750
No sexual intercourse

652
00:40:26.626 --> 00:40:28.251
You said there's no sex allowed in here

653
00:40:29.792 --> 00:40:32.500
We can't allow sex in here

654
00:40:34.376 --> 00:40:36.584
You said this place was for a staycation

655
00:40:36.751 --> 00:40:40.042
Yes, it's for a staycation

656
00:40:40.417 --> 00:40:43.375
You don't have to
have sex on a staycation

657
00:40:43.376 --> 00:40:44.126
Right?

658
00:40:46.834 --> 00:40:48.167
Can I lock the door?

659
00:40:48.167 --> 00:40:49.458
Sure

660
00:40:49.459 --> 00:40:51.875
A lot of people lock
the door, need some help?

661
00:40:51.876 --> 00:40:53.209
I'll lock it tighter for you

662
00:40:53.209 --> 00:40:54.500
A lot of people lock the door

663
00:42:33.792 --> 00:42:36.458
Excuse me, where's number 10?

664
00:42:36.459 --> 00:42:40.959
Namo Amitabha...

665
00:42:54.084 --> 00:42:55.500
Auntie...

666
00:42:56.167 --> 00:42:57.625
Auntie...

667
00:42:57.959 --> 00:42:59.334
Auntie...

668
00:43:04.751 --> 00:43:05.584
Which floor

669
00:43:05.584 --> 00:43:07.167
10th floor

670
00:43:16.376 --> 00:43:18.084
Just press "10" by yourself

671
00:43:29.042 --> 00:43:31.042
Where's Room C please?

672
00:43:36.042 --> 00:43:38.417
That way, I'll take you there

673
00:43:38.417 --> 00:43:39.708
Thank you

674
00:43:46.667 --> 00:43:48.792
Hurry up

675
00:44:00.334 --> 00:44:02.709
What took you so long? 
My legs are numb

676
00:44:02.709 --> 00:44:04.750
Why didn't you come and pick me up?

677
00:44:05.417 --> 00:44:06.917
I was prepping this room

678
00:44:06.917 --> 00:44:10.833
Look, a 5-star staycation, surprise!

679
00:44:10.834 --> 00:44:12.792
5-star?

680
00:44:12.792 --> 00:44:14.917
What is this place?

681
00:44:15.084 --> 00:44:18.250
A staycation, I decorated it myself,
isn't it nice?


682
00:44:18.376 --> 00:44:20.834
Why can't you just
book a normal hotel room?

683
00:44:20.834 --> 00:44:23.667
This is no different than a hotel staycation

684
00:44:23.667 --> 00:44:25.625
You can ask the little girl up front

685
00:44:26.417 --> 00:44:27.667
I've had enough

686
00:44:27.667 --> 00:44:29.250
This is a party room for rent

687
00:44:29.251 --> 00:44:31.417
It's a place for teenagers

688
00:44:31.417 --> 00:44:33.458
If you don't feel ashamed, 
I feel embarrassed

689
00:44:34.042 --> 00:44:35.208
Is it embarrassing?

690
00:44:35.209 --> 00:44:36.542
I think it...

691
00:44:36.834 --> 00:44:37.875
Makes me feel youthful

692
00:44:37.876 --> 00:44:39.251
Youthful?

693
00:44:40.542 --> 00:44:43.375
I don't have high standards

694
00:44:43.584 --> 00:44:45.625
Do I not deserve better?

695
00:44:45.626 --> 00:44:48.584
I spent five hours prepping this place

696
00:44:48.584 --> 00:44:49.667
If you're not satisfied

697
00:44:49.667 --> 00:44:52.000
Then you're no better than
your gold-digger friends


698
00:44:52.001 --> 00:44:53.417
I'm a gold-digger?

699
00:44:53.417 --> 00:44:56.417
You said that Simon is a fool
for treating Rose so well


700
00:44:56.417 --> 00:44:59.000
You just don't wanna spend money on me

701
00:44:59.834 --> 00:45:00.875
You're right

702
00:45:00.917 --> 00:45:02.917
I'm not as rich as them

703
00:45:03.251 --> 00:45:04.917
I'm just a taxi driver

704
00:45:06.376 --> 00:45:08.376
I'm not gonna argue, |I've had enough

705
00:45:08.459 --> 00:45:09.875
Let's break up

706
00:45:33.084 --> 00:45:34.584
Kwan

707
00:45:36.584 --> 00:45:37.875
What's up?

708
00:45:43.167 --> 00:45:47.625
There aren't many guys
who would spend so much time


709
00:45:47.626 --> 00:45:51.167
Trying to make their girlfriend happy

710
00:45:53.709 --> 00:45:56.084
Weren't you gonna leave me?

711
00:45:58.334 --> 00:46:00.709
I won't allow you
to say that about yourself

712
00:46:01.001 --> 00:46:04.667
Actually, my request is very simple

713
00:46:05.584 --> 00:46:07.834
I just want you and me to be...

714
00:46:07.834 --> 00:46:09.334
Together!

715
00:46:20.334 --> 00:46:22.459
You seem different today

716
00:46:22.459 --> 00:46:24.292
Is this hot?

717
00:46:24.334 --> 00:46:25.625
Yeah

718
00:47:12.834 --> 00:47:13.959
Kwan

719
00:47:13.959 --> 00:47:16.250
What's up with you? 
You look exhausted

720
00:47:17.084 --> 00:47:19.584
I went on a staycation last night

721
00:47:19.876 --> 00:47:21.792
My legs are sore

722
00:47:22.334 --> 00:47:24.417
How was the place?

723
00:47:24.417 --> 00:47:25.542
Of course it was fun

724
00:47:25.667 --> 00:47:27.542
I prepared some petals and fragrances

725
00:47:27.542 --> 00:47:29.750
It was as if she took an aphrodisiac

726
00:47:29.751 --> 00:47:31.209
She was climbing up and down

727
00:47:31.417 --> 00:47:33.125
She had her hands full

728
00:47:34.459 --> 00:47:37.584
I guess there's no need
to book a hotel after all

729
00:47:38.417 --> 00:47:39.625
Kwan

730
00:47:39.626 --> 00:47:41.917
Is your zodiac sign
the ox or the horse?

731
00:47:42.084 --> 00:47:43.500
It's the dog

732
00:47:43.626 --> 00:47:46.459
Did you get off the bed with
your left or right foot?


733
00:47:46.917 --> 00:47:47.542
Right foot

734
00:47:47.542 --> 00:47:49.042
No... the left foot

735
00:47:49.167 --> 00:47:51.000
Have you eaten an
orange in the past week?

736
00:47:51.001 --> 00:47:52.501
Does orange juice count?

737
00:47:53.001 --> 00:47:54.959
Did you call your mum?

738
00:47:59.334 --> 00:48:00.667
Holy shit

739
00:48:01.251 --> 00:48:02.834
That space is haunted

740
00:48:02.834 --> 00:48:03.667
What?

741
00:48:03.667 --> 00:48:05.500
You had an encounter with a ghost

742
00:48:05.501 --> 00:48:06.709
Fuck!

743
00:48:06.709 --> 00:48:08.709
What the hell do you mean?

744
00:48:08.709 --> 00:48:10.834
Your forehead is dark,
and your lips are pale

745
00:48:10.834 --> 00:48:12.667
You must've encountered something ghastly

746
00:48:15.792 --> 00:48:19.958
I had a staycation last night,
I'm just exhausted


747
00:48:19.959 --> 00:48:21.334
Right?

748
00:48:21.376 --> 00:48:22.667
No

749
00:48:22.667 --> 00:48:24.583
It was a horny ghost

750
00:48:24.584 --> 00:48:25.875
A horny ghost?

751
00:48:25.876 --> 00:48:27.251
Yeah

752
00:48:27.376 --> 00:48:28.751
Some spirits did not fulfill

753
00:48:28.751 --> 00:48:30.876
Their desires before they died

754
00:48:30.876 --> 00:48:33.167
So they wanna have sex even after death

755
00:48:33.167 --> 00:48:36.125
They'd possess spiritually weak souls

756
00:48:36.126 --> 00:48:37.501
And lure them into sex

757
00:48:37.501 --> 00:48:40.834
We call this a 'horny haunting'

758
00:48:41.126 --> 00:48:43.834
Horny haunting?!

759
00:48:44.209 --> 00:48:46.584
Was your girlfriend any different than usual?

760
00:48:47.834 --> 00:48:49.125
Nope

761
00:48:49.126 --> 00:48:49.751
No?

762
00:48:49.751 --> 00:48:53.126
She just keeps wanting more,
I'm all empty and dry man!


763
00:48:54.376 --> 00:48:57.292
Kwan, this doesn't sound bad at all

764
00:48:58.876 --> 00:48:59.501
Exactly

765
00:48:59.501 --> 00:49:00.876
Sounds awesome...

766
00:49:00.876 --> 00:49:02.167
Kwan

767
00:49:02.626 --> 00:49:04.042
Stop messing around

768
00:49:04.042 --> 00:49:05.250
Here

769
00:49:05.459 --> 00:49:07.000
Keep this talisman with you

770
00:49:07.292 --> 00:49:09.333
Did you steal this
from the ancestral hall again?

771
00:49:09.334 --> 00:49:10.292
You...

772
00:49:10.292 --> 00:49:13.458
Keep this with you, free of charge

773
00:49:14.626 --> 00:49:16.542
As a precaution

774
00:49:16.834 --> 00:49:18.625
And a peace of mind

775
00:49:20.542 --> 00:49:22.208
Alright then...

776
00:49:22.959 --> 00:49:24.709
So annoying

777
00:49:31.376 --> 00:49:34.334
"My Fickle & Naughty Little Minx"

778
00:49:45.459 --> 00:49:46.750
Hand it to me

779
00:49:46.751 --> 00:49:48.751
Why did you bring so much stuff down?

780
00:49:50.917 --> 00:49:52.167
This is all my stuff

781
00:49:52.167 --> 00:49:53.500
I didn't pack the bigger items yet

782
00:49:53.501 --> 00:49:55.001
I'll bring them to you later

783
00:49:55.042 --> 00:49:56.458
What happened?

784
00:49:56.834 --> 00:49:59.417
We've broken up, 
I don't want these in the way

785
00:49:59.959 --> 00:50:01.500
Broken up?

786
00:50:01.501 --> 00:50:03.209
What do you mean by that?

787
00:50:03.209 --> 00:50:06.750
We had... so much fun last night

788
00:50:06.751 --> 00:50:08.292
What's going on?

789
00:50:10.792 --> 00:50:12.833
Why are you always like this?

790
00:50:12.959 --> 00:50:15.667
You're so fickle, how can I adapt?

791
00:50:15.917 --> 00:50:17.042
Right, it's been so tough on you

792
00:50:17.042 --> 00:50:18.583
You don't have to adapt any more

793
00:50:21.001 --> 00:50:22.501
Ling Nai Yiu

794
00:50:29.417 --> 00:50:31.833
Let's go to the party room again

795
00:50:32.001 --> 00:50:34.959
You go to that ghastly place by yourself

796
00:50:35.584 --> 00:50:37.375
What ghastly place?

797
00:50:37.501 --> 00:50:39.334
You enjoyed yourself last night

798
00:50:39.501 --> 00:50:41.417
Do you remember?

799
00:50:43.917 --> 00:50:45.417
What happened?

800
00:50:56.626 --> 00:50:58.042
Hello?

801
00:50:58.251 --> 00:51:01.459
Hey baby, where are you now?

802
00:51:01.667 --> 00:51:04.958
I'm working right now, where else?

803
00:51:06.126 --> 00:51:08.876
Are you visiting me tonight?

804
00:51:09.084 --> 00:51:10.625
Where can I find you?

805
00:51:10.876 --> 00:51:13.792
Party room C

806
00:51:15.292 --> 00:51:16.958
You're there right now?

807
00:51:17.167 --> 00:51:18.333
What are you doing there?

808
00:51:18.334 --> 00:51:20.500
Isn't that place too cheap for you?

809
00:51:20.917 --> 00:51:22.583
Don't stay there too long

810
00:51:22.917 --> 00:51:25.500
I'll make it up to you tonight

811
00:51:25.501 --> 00:51:28.126
You can do whatever you want with me

812
00:51:30.292 --> 00:51:31.917
I'm coming now

813
00:51:37.084 --> 00:51:38.500
You're here

814
00:51:38.501 --> 00:51:40.834
I've been waiting for so long

815
00:51:41.126 --> 00:51:43.834
Didn't you say this place
was too cheap for you?

816
00:51:44.959 --> 00:51:46.584
Why wouldn't I like it?

817
00:51:46.584 --> 00:51:50.459
You have to visit me
more often from now on

818
00:51:52.376 --> 00:51:54.042
You sometimes complain about this and that

819
00:51:54.042 --> 00:51:55.958
And now you're being so reasonable

820
00:53:01.792 --> 00:53:03.250
That'll be $160, thank you

821
00:53:03.251 --> 00:53:04.334
So expensive?

822
00:53:04.459 --> 00:53:06.625
It's usually $140

823
00:53:07.417 --> 00:53:10.042
But the meter says $160,
are you paying or not?

824
00:53:10.042 --> 00:53:11.458
It's usually $140

825
00:53:11.459 --> 00:53:13.334
Did you take a detour?

826
00:53:13.334 --> 00:53:14.875
I only have $140 with
me, do you want it?

827
00:53:15.001 --> 00:53:16.584
You're still missing $20

828
00:53:16.584 --> 00:53:17.917
I don't have any more

829
00:53:19.292 --> 00:53:21.083
I only have $140 in cash

830
00:53:21.084 --> 00:53:23.875
It's usually $140, and it's $160 today

831
00:53:23.876 --> 00:53:24.959
Why is it so expensive?

832
00:53:24.959 --> 00:53:26.000
Get out of my car

833
00:53:26.001 --> 00:53:27.084
No, I only have $140

834
00:53:27.584 --> 00:53:29.084
Actually...

835
00:53:29.167 --> 00:53:30.833
A lot of people don't understand that

836
00:53:32.001 --> 00:53:35.542
Taxi drivers are under a lot of pressure

837
00:53:37.709 --> 00:53:41.042
This customer slammed my door today

838
00:53:42.334 --> 00:53:44.250
And said I was a 'taxi dog'

839
00:53:46.001 --> 00:53:49.459
Many people are rude in Hong Kong nowadays

840
00:53:49.542 --> 00:53:53.250
Don't worry, I'll help you tell them off

841
00:53:55.209 --> 00:53:56.500
Nai Yiu

842
00:53:57.292 --> 00:53:58.917
I've been so happy lately

843
00:53:59.209 --> 00:54:01.500
I love talking with you like this

844
00:54:01.501 --> 00:54:03.667
It feels like...

845
00:54:04.251 --> 00:54:07.001
I'm so close to you

846
00:54:07.251 --> 00:54:10.417
Our conversations are so deep

847
00:54:11.917 --> 00:54:14.375
Then... do you wanna...

848
00:54:14.584 --> 00:54:16.375
Go deeper?

849
00:54:21.584 --> 00:54:22.917
Nai Yiu

850
00:54:23.709 --> 00:54:25.667
Nai Yiu, where are you going?

851
00:54:31.417 --> 00:54:33.333
That's deep, really deep

852
00:54:35.417 --> 00:54:36.708
Thanks

853
00:54:37.584 --> 00:54:38.875
You're missing 40 cents

854
00:54:38.917 --> 00:54:40.417
You're asking for 40 cents change?

855
00:54:40.417 --> 00:54:41.625
That's still money, isn't it?

856
00:54:41.959 --> 00:54:43.834
Damn taxi dog

857
00:54:46.626 --> 00:54:47.751
See you later, sucker

858
00:54:54.876 --> 00:54:57.542
My husband's abroad, let's go to my place

859
00:54:57.792 --> 00:55:00.042
Please puke inside the plastic bag

860
00:55:00.251 --> 00:55:02.667
Stop it, the driver can see us

861
00:55:02.667 --> 00:55:05.125
So what? I'll beat
the shit out of him

862
00:55:05.126 --> 00:55:07.792
I said, puke inside the plastic bag

863
00:55:07.834 --> 00:55:10.334
What are you looking at? 
Eyes on the road

864
00:55:12.334 --> 00:55:14.334
Granny's gonna give me shit this time

865
00:55:22.334 --> 00:55:24.042
Can you push harder?

866
00:55:24.042 --> 00:55:24.667
Alright...

867
00:55:32.334 --> 00:55:34.667
Let's go again

868
00:55:37.001 --> 00:55:37.501
What?

869
00:55:52.292 --> 00:55:53.458
Harder

870
00:55:55.251 --> 00:55:56.417
harder

871
00:56:01.084 --> 00:56:02.584
Let's do it again

872
00:56:02.584 --> 00:56:04.750
No, I have to leave

873
00:56:04.959 --> 00:56:07.042
Why?

874
00:56:08.251 --> 00:56:10.876
I'm covering the morning shift tomorrow

875
00:56:10.876 --> 00:56:13.126
I told you, remember?

876
00:56:15.084 --> 00:56:17.834
Are you losing interest in me?

877
00:56:18.292 --> 00:56:19.167
Nai Yiu

878
00:56:19.167 --> 00:56:21.708
Love is not just about sex

879
00:56:21.709 --> 00:56:23.792
I feel like you're suffocating me

880
00:56:28.584 --> 00:56:29.917
What is it now?

881
00:56:30.126 --> 00:56:32.084
I'm really tired

882
00:56:32.626 --> 00:56:33.876
I can't get it up

883
00:56:34.667 --> 00:56:36.750
You can do it, let's go again

884
00:56:39.876 --> 00:56:41.334
You forced my hand

885
00:56:56.126 --> 00:56:56.917
You can't eat that

886
00:56:59.959 --> 00:57:01.084
Again...

887
00:57:06.792 --> 00:57:08.375
You're awake?

888
00:57:20.542 --> 00:57:22.667
Look at his utterly exhausted face

889
00:57:22.667 --> 00:57:23.375
Kwan

890
00:57:23.376 --> 00:57:24.876
Did you break up?

891
00:57:26.459 --> 00:57:27.542
Where's the talisman I gave you?

892
00:57:27.542 --> 00:57:29.125
Did you use it?

893
00:57:31.751 --> 00:57:35.709
I'm sure your girlfriend has been possessed

894
00:57:35.709 --> 00:57:37.375
By a horny ghost?

895
00:57:37.459 --> 00:57:39.584
That doesn't sound too bad, seem like fun

896
00:57:39.584 --> 00:57:41.042
Fun?

897
00:57:41.042 --> 00:57:43.958
He will be totally sucked dry, and die!

898
00:57:44.084 --> 00:57:46.375
Kwan, then don't go anymore

899
00:57:46.667 --> 00:57:49.417
Don't? What do you mean?

900
00:57:49.917 --> 00:57:51.917
If I don't go on a staycation

901
00:57:51.917 --> 00:57:53.458
She'll break up with me

902
00:57:54.417 --> 00:57:55.250
Don't do it, Kwan

903
00:57:55.251 --> 00:57:57.376
I don't want to either

904
00:57:57.959 --> 00:58:00.292
She wants sex every night

905
00:58:00.292 --> 00:58:02.375
I'm exhausted, you know?

906
00:58:02.376 --> 00:58:05.709
If I don't sleep,
my granny's gonna be mad

907
00:58:06.084 --> 00:58:07.834
Don't go, Kwan

908
00:58:09.209 --> 00:58:10.125
- It's okay...
- Calm down


909
00:58:10.126 --> 00:58:11.626
It's okay...

910
00:58:12.001 --> 00:58:14.542
- Do you have water?
- Water? Water...


911
00:58:15.209 --> 00:58:16.000
Excuse me, do you have water?

912
00:58:16.001 --> 00:58:17.376
Have some water and you'll be fine

913
00:58:17.376 --> 00:58:18.251
Excuse me, do you have water?

914
00:58:18.251 --> 00:58:19.459
I do... here you go

915
00:58:21.001 --> 00:58:22.667
You'll feel better after some water

916
00:58:37.084 --> 00:58:38.417
That's ghost saliva!

917
00:58:39.459 --> 00:58:42.084
The bag feels heavy...

918
00:58:44.542 --> 00:58:45.375
The party room

919
00:58:45.376 --> 00:58:46.751
Give me the address

920
00:58:46.751 --> 00:58:47.876
What are you gonna do?

921
00:58:47.876 --> 00:58:49.209
Come on, time to go ghost busting!

922
00:58:51.334 --> 00:58:53.167
Don't tell granny!

923
00:58:53.167 --> 00:58:55.125
We're almost there, hang on!

924
00:59:01.501 --> 00:59:02.251
Hey!

925
00:59:02.251 --> 00:59:04.167
What did you do to my comic?

926
00:59:04.167 --> 00:59:06.333
Are you having a threesome today?

927
00:59:06.459 --> 00:59:08.000
Stop messing around

928
00:59:08.001 --> 00:59:10.084
Which room does he usually
go to? Tell me now

929
00:59:10.084 --> 00:59:12.292
What are you doing here, uncle?

930
00:59:12.292 --> 00:59:12.958
What am I doing here?

931
00:59:12.959 --> 00:59:15.750
I'm here for an exorcism, hurry up

932
00:59:18.959 --> 00:59:21.292
What does that mean?

933
00:59:21.376 --> 00:59:23.251
Room C

934
00:59:23.251 --> 00:59:24.542
Fucking hell

935
00:59:25.042 --> 00:59:26.167
That was a 'C'?

936
00:59:26.167 --> 00:59:28.750
Aggressive jerk

937
00:59:35.042 --> 00:59:36.250
Where's your girlfriend?

938
00:59:36.251 --> 00:59:37.834
She's not here yet

939
00:59:42.084 --> 00:59:44.334
Demonic entity, show yourself!

940
00:59:51.334 --> 00:59:54.959
Why didn't you tell
me you're bringing a friend?

941
00:59:55.126 --> 00:59:57.584
This is Fatso, 
I came uninvited

942
00:59:58.251 --> 00:59:59.751
Fatso?

943
01:00:00.209 --> 01:00:03.917
You're like a cute teddy bear

944
01:00:03.917 --> 01:00:06.792
Do you want a taste?

945
01:00:09.126 --> 01:00:10.459
Are you crazy?

946
01:00:10.459 --> 01:00:13.667
Put your clothes back on

947
01:00:17.376 --> 01:00:18.584
Take this

948
01:00:19.501 --> 01:00:20.709
Out of my way

949
01:00:24.001 --> 01:00:25.042
Horny ghost...

950
01:00:25.042 --> 01:00:26.417
I'll skip the niceties

951
01:00:28.084 --> 01:00:29.084
You wanna escape?

952
01:00:34.959 --> 01:00:36.250
Die, horny ghost!

953
01:00:36.876 --> 01:00:38.834
Are you crazy? 
You'll hurt her

954
01:00:38.834 --> 01:00:40.542
Babe, I'm so scared

955
01:00:40.542 --> 01:00:42.042
Get out of here...

956
01:00:43.084 --> 01:00:44.584
Die, here I come

957
01:00:46.667 --> 01:00:48.000
You're lying down again?

958
01:00:48.001 --> 01:00:49.042
Accept your death!

959
01:00:51.376 --> 01:00:52.167
Hey!

960
01:00:52.292 --> 01:00:53.667
I'm helping you

961
01:00:53.667 --> 01:00:55.167
She's been possessed

962
01:00:55.834 --> 01:00:57.292
She's indeed been possessed

963
01:00:57.501 --> 01:00:59.251
But she treats me well

964
01:01:00.042 --> 01:01:01.125
Fuck this

965
01:01:02.584 --> 01:01:03.959
Escape is futile

966
01:01:09.251 --> 01:01:11.376
Your fate is death, evil spirit

967
01:01:13.459 --> 01:01:15.042
What is it now?

968
01:01:15.042 --> 01:01:16.042
She'll suck out all of your energy

969
01:01:16.042 --> 01:01:17.542
You'll die

970
01:01:17.792 --> 01:01:19.292
Let's not get physical

971
01:01:19.376 --> 01:01:20.876
We can talk this out

972
01:01:27.959 --> 01:01:29.000
Where is she?

973
01:01:30.042 --> 01:01:31.500
She's here

974
01:01:32.501 --> 01:01:33.292
What now?

975
01:01:33.459 --> 01:01:34.875
You can't escape anymore?

976
01:01:34.876 --> 01:01:36.959
Evil spirit, you will perish

977
01:01:50.251 --> 01:01:51.751
Are you okay?

978
01:02:09.417 --> 01:02:11.875
Is there a more
humane way to do this?

979
01:02:13.834 --> 01:02:17.542
This ghost is really
horny, you can't take it

980
01:02:18.292 --> 01:02:19.333
I'm sorry for this

981
01:02:23.459 --> 01:02:27.959
Kwan, you don't love me anymore

982
01:02:32.417 --> 01:02:34.417
How could I not love you?

983
01:02:34.667 --> 01:02:36.250
During this period of time

984
01:02:36.251 --> 01:02:38.292
You gave me so much joy

985
01:02:39.584 --> 01:02:41.584
But we're from different worlds

986
01:02:43.334 --> 01:02:45.750
We have different frequencies

987
01:02:47.292 --> 01:02:48.958
How about this

988
01:02:48.959 --> 01:02:50.667
You slow down your frequency

989
01:02:50.834 --> 01:02:55.250
And we can meet
up occasionally and have fun

990
01:02:55.459 --> 01:02:56.042
Okay?

991
01:03:00.001 --> 01:03:00.876
Fatso

992
01:03:00.876 --> 01:03:03.167
Please help me convince this lady

993
01:03:05.751 --> 01:03:08.376
She's not a lady, she's a man

994
01:03:10.209 --> 01:03:11.667
Mister...

995
01:03:11.667 --> 01:03:14.167
Please let my friend go

996
01:03:14.542 --> 01:03:16.292
He's not suitable for you

997
01:03:16.501 --> 01:03:19.334
She's not a lady, she's a man

998
01:03:27.834 --> 01:03:29.042
I'm not homophobic

999
01:03:29.042 --> 01:03:31.333
I just don't want that
gay pervert to mess with me

1000
01:03:35.876 --> 01:03:36.751
Whatever you're reading

1001
01:03:36.751 --> 01:03:40.292
Defies the traditional Chinese values
of man and wife


1002
01:03:43.584 --> 01:03:46.042
Some might say that you're
discriminating their sexuality


1003
01:03:46.501 --> 01:03:48.084
You'll be raped

1004
01:03:52.167 --> 01:03:54.042
Granny's gonna give me shit this time

1005
01:03:55.501 --> 01:03:57.042
Do you know what a public toilet is?

1006
01:03:57.417 --> 01:03:59.375
Anyone can go in and
out of a public toilet

1007
01:03:59.376 --> 01:04:02.709
Free entry, equal amongst all

1008
01:04:12.126 --> 01:04:14.042
What's wrong with indulging on a man's dragon?

1009
01:04:14.042 --> 01:04:16.375
Why are you modern people so old school?

1010
01:04:31.792 --> 01:04:33.125
Kwan

1011
01:04:33.126 --> 01:04:34.917
Where's the talisman I gave you?

1012
01:04:37.084 --> 01:04:37.792
The talisman?

1013
01:04:37.792 --> 01:04:39.167
You mean that bell thing?

1014
01:04:39.167 --> 01:04:41.333
Right, I have it

1015
01:04:45.542 --> 01:04:46.917
Kwan... did you find it?

1016
01:04:46.917 --> 01:04:48.667
I'm searching for it... wait

1017
01:04:48.667 --> 01:04:50.417
Can you hurry up?

1018
01:04:51.001 --> 01:04:52.001
Kwan...

1019
01:04:53.751 --> 01:04:55.251
How about this scripture?

1020
01:04:56.126 --> 01:04:57.376
That'll work

1021
01:04:58.417 --> 01:05:02.167
Go on, stick it on

1022
01:05:02.501 --> 01:05:03.709
Kwan

1023
01:05:05.834 --> 01:05:10.125
I had a really good
time these past few weeks

1024
01:05:12.334 --> 01:05:16.834
No man has ever treated me so well

1025
01:05:17.917 --> 01:05:22.417
I knew our relationship will
eventually come to an end


1026
01:05:24.917 --> 01:05:28.667
If you have the heart to
forever cease my reincarnation


1027
01:05:29.042 --> 01:05:31.292
And dissipate into the abyss

1028
01:05:31.292 --> 01:05:33.375
Then go ahead and stick it on

1029
01:05:42.292 --> 01:05:44.500
You asshole

1030
01:05:49.209 --> 01:05:50.542
You're awake?

1031
01:05:52.084 --> 01:05:53.917
What am I doing here?

1032
01:05:55.251 --> 01:05:56.376
You're okay now

1033
01:05:58.834 --> 01:06:00.917
What is he doing?

1034
01:06:01.584 --> 01:06:05.125
He's just playing some music

1035
01:06:06.542 --> 01:06:08.542
The bag you just bought is so cute

1036
01:06:08.542 --> 01:06:11.208
I wanted to buy the red one

1037
01:06:11.209 --> 01:06:12.667
It's new this season

1038
01:06:12.667 --> 01:06:14.583
If you don't buy it, it'll be off-season

1039
01:06:14.584 --> 01:06:15.834
Babe

1040
01:06:16.959 --> 01:06:18.375
- I'll help you with that
- Thank you


1041
01:06:18.709 --> 01:06:20.417
Do you girls need a ride?

1042
01:06:20.417 --> 01:06:23.250
It's okay, we'll get out of your hair

1043
01:06:23.251 --> 01:06:25.334
You got yourself a red stallion

1044
01:06:26.001 --> 01:06:27.792
We'll be waiting for your wedding invitations

1045
01:06:27.792 --> 01:06:29.208
Alright, get lost

1046
01:06:29.459 --> 01:06:30.500
Is she sick of us already?

1047
01:06:30.917 --> 01:06:32.583
Alright, see you

1048
01:06:36.167 --> 01:06:39.042
"Domineering Driver and the Dainty Wife"

1049
01:07:01.709 --> 01:07:03.959
Do people still use these machines?

1050
01:07:07.584 --> 01:07:09.084
They look quite nice

1051
01:07:11.167 --> 01:07:11.958
Waste of air conditioning

1052
01:07:56.626 --> 01:07:58.751
There's a ghost, just now...

1053
01:07:59.709 --> 01:08:02.000
Don't be such a chickenshit

1054
01:08:10.167 --> 01:08:11.583
Don't run around

1055
01:08:11.834 --> 01:08:13.334
This way

1056
01:08:14.626 --> 01:08:16.792
No, just now...

1057
01:08:25.501 --> 01:08:27.001
Little girl

1058
01:08:27.959 --> 01:08:30.375
Are you a human or a ghost?

1059
01:08:41.376 --> 01:08:44.376
"Haunted Shopping Mall"

1060
01:09:04.417 --> 01:09:06.542
Do you know where Kat went to play?

1061
01:09:10.126 --> 01:09:11.542
Hey

1062
01:09:12.834 --> 01:09:15.084
Kat, time for some candy

1063
01:09:15.876 --> 01:09:18.709
You guys must think that a quiet mall
means it's haunted


1064
01:09:18.709 --> 01:09:23.209
You're wrong! This place was
bustling in the 80s and 90s


1065
01:09:23.959 --> 01:09:26.209
But it's also a time
when it was the most haunted

1066
01:09:26.209 --> 01:09:29.042
Because this place attracts couples
who are ready to get married


1067
01:09:29.042 --> 01:09:32.375
And it also attracts children who
are to be reincarnated


1068
01:09:33.251 --> 01:09:34.584
This bride-to-be

1069
01:09:34.584 --> 01:09:36.750
Do you want to try anything in particular?

1070
01:09:36.751 --> 01:09:38.626
We have all kinds of styles here

1071
01:09:38.626 --> 01:09:40.626
You can take your pick

1072
01:09:40.834 --> 01:09:42.834
I want something that shows my shoulder

1073
01:09:42.834 --> 01:09:45.792
When I was a kid,
I used to play at my mom's store


1074
01:09:45.792 --> 01:09:47.500
I'd watch her pick wedding dresses for clients

1075
01:09:47.501 --> 01:09:48.959
While she helped the kids seek prospective mothers

1076
01:09:48.959 --> 01:09:52.250
How about this one? 
It shows your shoulders

1077
01:09:52.251 --> 01:09:53.542
The bottom is like a princess' dress

1078
01:09:53.542 --> 01:09:56.000
It looks elegant, and sexy

1079
01:09:56.001 --> 01:09:57.751
I think I'll take this one

1080
01:09:57.959 --> 01:10:00.167
But can you add a
piece of cloth in the front?

1081
01:10:00.167 --> 01:10:01.417
To cover my baby belly

1082
01:10:03.167 --> 01:10:05.458
Sure... I'll adjust it for you...

1083
01:10:05.459 --> 01:10:06.959
Alright, thank you

1084
01:10:07.876 --> 01:10:08.709
Alright...

1085
01:10:11.751 --> 01:10:12.501
Thank you

1086
01:10:12.501 --> 01:10:15.917
Come back for a fitting next Thursday,
thank you...


1087
01:10:16.376 --> 01:10:17.209
Bye-bye

1088
01:10:17.417 --> 01:10:18.875
Bye-bye

1089
01:10:19.501 --> 01:10:21.001
Bye-bye

1090
01:10:25.709 --> 01:10:27.709
Patting the back of a ghost's dead

1091
01:10:42.376 --> 01:10:43.751
Hello

1092
01:10:43.751 --> 01:10:44.959
She's called Kat

1093
01:10:45.501 --> 01:10:47.167
When my mom was busy working

1094
01:10:47.167 --> 01:10:48.500
And couldn't attend to me

1095
01:10:48.501 --> 01:10:50.959
She'd always be there to play with me

1096
01:10:51.792 --> 01:10:54.000
Don't you want to reincarnate?

1097
01:10:55.084 --> 01:10:58.875
Yay! Then you can stay
here and play with me

1098
01:11:05.209 --> 01:11:06.417
After mom retired

1099
01:11:06.417 --> 01:11:07.917
I took over the store

1100
01:11:08.084 --> 01:11:09.834
But nobody goes to malls these days

1101
01:11:09.834 --> 01:11:10.834
Not even a ghost in sight

1102
01:11:10.834 --> 01:11:12.417
It's heavy

1103
01:11:12.751 --> 01:11:15.126
Takeout has arrived

1104
01:11:16.417 --> 01:11:17.917
Good, I can smell it

1105
01:11:18.334 --> 01:11:20.334
Let's order from Cheung Fat next time

1106
01:11:20.334 --> 01:11:23.167
The long-haired delivery guy seems nice

1107
01:11:23.167 --> 01:11:25.417
Cheung Fat closed down two days ago

1108
01:11:25.417 --> 01:11:28.708
Business wasn't holding up

1109
01:11:30.292 --> 01:11:31.625
Chiuchow lady told me today

1110
01:11:31.626 --> 01:11:33.667
That she's closing at
the end of the month

1111
01:11:33.959 --> 01:11:35.959
Pretty much all the
stores in 3/F have closed

1112
01:11:38.251 --> 01:11:41.792
I thought her Chinese wedding gowns were beautiful

1113
01:11:41.959 --> 01:11:45.667
I always wished I would
have a chance to buy one

1114
01:11:46.417 --> 01:11:49.542
But it's closing before I can get married

1115
01:11:51.126 --> 01:11:52.751
It's okay, Fong

1116
01:11:52.751 --> 01:11:55.501
You still have another two weeks

1117
01:11:55.501 --> 01:11:56.376
Alright

1118
01:12:00.876 --> 01:12:03.792
No...

1119
01:12:03.834 --> 01:12:05.042
I'm a vegan...

1120
01:12:05.042 --> 01:12:06.833
I'm a vegan

1121
01:12:09.501 --> 01:12:11.167
Eat some more

1122
01:12:11.876 --> 01:12:12.834
No...

1123
01:12:12.834 --> 01:12:13.875
Have some more

1124
01:12:13.876 --> 01:12:15.376
I'm a vegan

1125
01:12:18.167 --> 01:12:19.250
Fire!

1126
01:12:19.251 --> 01:12:22.751
- Help...
- We're coming...


1127
01:12:23.209 --> 01:12:24.625
- What's going on?
- Fire!


1128
01:12:24.626 --> 01:12:28.126
There's a raging fire, help

1129
01:12:28.126 --> 01:12:30.167
It's such a big fire, 
I can't breathe...

1130
01:12:30.167 --> 01:12:31.667
I can't breathe...

1131
01:12:32.292 --> 01:12:33.958
Alright... I'll help you...

1132
01:12:33.959 --> 01:12:35.459
It's so hot... it's burning

1133
01:12:39.667 --> 01:12:41.083
It's settled

1134
01:12:41.459 --> 01:12:42.584
Thank you, firefighting hero

1135
01:12:42.584 --> 01:12:44.084
What happened?

1136
01:12:44.959 --> 01:12:48.042
I couldn't sleep, so I lit some incense

1137
01:12:48.042 --> 01:12:49.667
Then I immediately fell asleep

1138
01:12:49.667 --> 01:12:52.167
And this girl kept feeding me meat

1139
01:12:52.167 --> 01:12:54.042
I ate so much meat

1140
01:12:54.042 --> 01:12:56.708
It must've been the vegan chicken stew
from last time


1141
01:12:57.084 --> 01:12:59.917
What? It was a vegan chicken stew?

1142
01:12:59.959 --> 01:13:01.709
The one from Sam Pan?

1143
01:13:01.709 --> 01:13:02.792
Yeah

1144
01:13:03.001 --> 01:13:05.251
They serve vegan food there?

1145
01:13:05.709 --> 01:13:06.875
Nope

1146
01:13:07.084 --> 01:13:08.167
Edward

1147
01:13:09.042 --> 01:13:11.458
As long as you
have veganism in your heart

1148
01:13:13.126 --> 01:13:14.959
The floor's wet, 
I'll get a mop

1149
01:13:16.626 --> 01:13:18.209
I'll wipe your desk

1150
01:13:24.834 --> 01:13:28.250
You guys keep talking about Kat

1151
01:13:28.251 --> 01:13:30.084
Is she missing a front tooth?

1152
01:13:30.167 --> 01:13:32.750
Yeah, did you see her?

1153
01:13:34.292 --> 01:13:35.792
I get it now

1154
01:13:35.876 --> 01:13:37.001
She knew I was a vegan

1155
01:13:37.001 --> 01:13:38.417
So she fed me meat on purpose

1156
01:13:38.417 --> 01:13:39.917
To shock me into waking up

1157
01:13:40.042 --> 01:13:42.792
Otherwise I would've died from the fire

1158
01:13:43.334 --> 01:13:46.209
Help me thank her if you see her

1159
01:13:46.501 --> 01:13:48.751
I haven't seen her in a long time

1160
01:13:55.709 --> 01:13:57.542
There's a ghost!

1161
01:13:57.542 --> 01:13:59.042
I'm terrified

1162
01:13:59.209 --> 01:14:00.584
There's another one there

1163
01:14:00.584 --> 01:14:02.875
What kind of a shopping mall is this?

1164
01:14:04.084 --> 01:14:05.292
It's Kat

1165
01:14:19.584 --> 01:14:20.750
Fong

1166
01:14:21.334 --> 01:14:22.750
Fong...

1167
01:14:27.501 --> 01:14:28.876
Kat

1168
01:14:29.126 --> 01:14:30.626
Hello

1169
01:14:33.001 --> 01:14:34.959
I've been looking for you

1170
01:14:37.459 --> 01:14:39.542
Kat is a little rascal

1171
01:14:39.542 --> 01:14:41.250
She loved playing pranks

1172
01:14:41.667 --> 01:14:44.167
But she only does it with reason

1173
01:14:44.167 --> 01:14:45.792
One time, Edward forgot to lock up

1174
01:14:45.792 --> 01:14:47.583
Someone was stealing from his store

1175
01:14:47.584 --> 01:14:49.917
And Kat wouldn't let him leave

1176
01:14:58.584 --> 01:15:00.167
In another instance, 
Yee was in the toilet

1177
01:15:00.167 --> 01:15:02.417
A pervert was taking pictures of her

1178
01:15:02.417 --> 01:15:05.333
Luckily, Kat came to the rescue

1179
01:15:06.417 --> 01:15:07.542
You're taking pictures?

1180
01:15:14.834 --> 01:15:16.917
What's your plan?

1181
01:15:18.292 --> 01:15:19.792
What are you guys talking about?

1182
01:15:20.126 --> 01:15:21.626
Take a look at this

1183
01:15:26.542 --> 01:15:28.500
Oh shit...

1184
01:15:29.876 --> 01:15:31.917
You guys got it too?

1185
01:15:33.167 --> 01:15:34.417
We tried fighting against it

1186
01:15:34.417 --> 01:15:36.083
We don't have a choice but leave

1187
01:15:36.084 --> 01:15:38.125
I just didn't think it'd come so soon

1188
01:15:38.126 --> 01:15:40.626
Gotta move out by
the end of the month

1189
01:15:40.626 --> 01:15:42.584
Once they shut the four of us down

1190
01:15:42.584 --> 01:15:44.667
That's the end for the mall

1191
01:15:58.042 --> 01:15:59.292
What's up?

1192
01:15:59.501 --> 01:16:01.459
What's next for you?

1193
01:16:04.209 --> 01:16:05.709
I haven't thought about it

1194
01:16:05.959 --> 01:16:07.792
You knew we'd be kicked out soon

1195
01:16:07.792 --> 01:16:09.833
You really never thought about it?

1196
01:16:10.709 --> 01:16:12.875
I don't wanna leave

1197
01:16:13.876 --> 01:16:15.459
It's great here

1198
01:16:15.459 --> 01:16:16.834
Take a look

1199
01:16:18.209 --> 01:16:19.709
Don't you like it?

1200
01:16:21.084 --> 01:16:22.250
I've been here for many years

1201
01:16:22.251 --> 01:16:23.917
Of course I'd like it here

1202
01:16:25.084 --> 01:16:26.375
Everything's old and worn down

1203
01:16:26.376 --> 01:16:28.251
Why would you like it here?

1204
01:16:31.792 --> 01:16:33.042
There can be many reasons

1205
01:16:33.042 --> 01:16:35.042
To like a place

1206
01:16:35.917 --> 01:16:38.625
Perhaps it's because of the people here

1207
01:16:41.834 --> 01:16:44.709
I'm changing professions after the shop closes

1208
01:16:44.917 --> 01:16:46.375
What are you gonna do?

1209
01:16:46.376 --> 01:16:48.459
A friend asked me to
start a business in Taiwan

1210
01:16:48.459 --> 01:16:50.584
But we don't know what we're gonna do

1211
01:16:50.709 --> 01:16:53.292
I've never heard you mention it,
is it a boy or a girl?


1212
01:16:53.584 --> 01:16:55.125
Who is this person?

1213
01:16:55.917 --> 01:16:57.792
Secondary school classmate

1214
01:16:58.001 --> 01:16:59.709
Why are you so up tight?

1215
01:16:59.834 --> 01:17:01.417
What's that got to do with you?

1216
01:17:04.667 --> 01:17:05.833
- You...
- So...


1217
01:17:06.501 --> 01:17:07.751
You go first

1218
01:17:07.751 --> 01:17:09.584
Go ahead, you might forget

1219
01:17:09.751 --> 01:17:11.251
Are you gonna say it?

1220
01:17:12.501 --> 01:17:14.626
What do you wanna do before you leave?

1221
01:17:14.626 --> 01:17:16.501
I'll help you fulfill one wish

1222
01:17:16.501 --> 01:17:18.001
One wish? That's a lot

1223
01:17:18.251 --> 01:17:19.751
Let's start with one

1224
01:17:24.834 --> 01:17:27.250
I just want this
place to be bustling again

1225
01:17:28.126 --> 01:17:30.376
Giving us hope

1226
01:17:31.667 --> 01:17:34.333
I don't care how much money we make

1227
01:17:34.417 --> 01:17:37.167
As long as we're all happy together

1228
01:17:40.042 --> 01:17:43.458
That's a lot of
wishes, you know that right?

1229
01:17:44.042 --> 01:17:45.792
You're so useless

1230
01:17:46.167 --> 01:17:47.667
I'm just saying it as it is

1231
01:17:50.376 --> 01:17:52.417
I'm also worried about Kat

1232
01:17:53.501 --> 01:17:55.709
When all the stores close

1233
01:17:56.417 --> 01:17:57.917
I dunno what's gonna happen to her

1234
01:17:59.292 --> 01:18:01.542
Maybe we can persuade her to leave

1235
01:18:01.542 --> 01:18:03.875
I've been trying since forever

1236
01:18:08.084 --> 01:18:10.417
Or we could find her a good family

1237
01:18:10.417 --> 01:18:12.458
And let her reincarnate

1238
01:18:13.042 --> 01:18:16.125
That sounds good

1239
01:18:36.709 --> 01:18:38.000
What are you doing?

1240
01:18:38.001 --> 01:18:38.792
Kiss me

1241
01:18:38.792 --> 01:18:39.417
What?

1242
01:18:47.126 --> 01:18:48.209
Kat

1243
01:18:50.376 --> 01:18:51.501
You little rascal

1244
01:18:51.501 --> 01:18:52.876
You can't do that,
I've told you many times before


1245
01:18:52.876 --> 01:18:54.917
I'm just trying to
help you, you're the rascal

1246
01:18:57.834 --> 01:18:59.042
What? What's happening?

1247
01:19:00.001 --> 01:19:01.501
Nothing

1248
01:19:02.417 --> 01:19:03.333
Let's go inside

1249
01:19:03.334 --> 01:19:04.209
Sure

1250
01:19:07.251 --> 01:19:08.584
Kat

1251
01:19:11.376 --> 01:19:12.792
Kat

1252
01:19:13.084 --> 01:19:15.209
I know you're here

1253
01:19:18.834 --> 01:19:20.125
Kat

1254
01:19:24.042 --> 01:19:26.667
Our store is closing at
the end of the month

1255
01:19:28.542 --> 01:19:30.458
You shouldn't stay here any longer

1256
01:19:34.709 --> 01:19:37.334
Don't be so childish

1257
01:19:38.084 --> 01:19:39.625
You knew this place was getting torn down

1258
01:19:39.626 --> 01:19:42.001
It's dangerous for you here

1259
01:19:51.417 --> 01:19:55.667
Didn't you say you'd play with me?

1260
01:19:57.292 --> 01:19:59.417
I know it's hard to let go

1261
01:20:00.376 --> 01:20:02.042
It's hard for me as well

1262
01:20:04.667 --> 01:20:06.333
There's nothing we can do

1263
01:20:07.792 --> 01:20:09.125
Where can I go?

1264
01:20:09.126 --> 01:20:12.167
I just wanna play with you

1265
01:20:13.959 --> 01:20:17.834
If you don't leave, your soul
will dissipate forever


1266
01:20:17.834 --> 01:20:20.084
Then we don't be
able to see each other

1267
01:20:31.542 --> 01:20:32.792
Be good

1268
01:20:33.876 --> 01:20:36.709
Find a good family to reincarnate into

1269
01:20:39.417 --> 01:20:41.292
We'll see each other in the next life

1270
01:21:06.709 --> 01:21:10.042
Edward made a PR
campaign on the mall's closure

1271
01:21:10.251 --> 01:21:12.292
There are so many prospective parents

1272
01:21:12.292 --> 01:21:14.250
Kat will definitely be able to
reincarnate this time!


1273
01:21:14.251 --> 01:21:15.417
Come and take a look

1274
01:21:15.917 --> 01:21:17.000
Have a look

1275
01:21:26.376 --> 01:21:27.501
You look beautiful today

1276
01:21:27.501 --> 01:21:28.876
I know

1277
01:21:29.334 --> 01:21:31.125
Hi, take a look at this

1278
01:21:32.084 --> 01:21:35.250
Are you two planning to have children?

1279
01:21:36.167 --> 01:21:38.083
We'd prefer if it was
just the two of us

1280
01:21:42.251 --> 01:21:44.209
Have you considered having children?

1281
01:21:44.209 --> 01:21:45.042
What?

1282
01:21:45.042 --> 01:21:47.250
Marriage is about producing offspring

1283
01:21:47.251 --> 01:21:49.084
It's a cardinal rule

1284
01:21:49.501 --> 01:21:50.959
And we have some baby items on sale

1285
01:21:50.959 --> 01:21:52.459
I can talk you through it

1286
01:21:54.792 --> 01:21:56.292
I don't think we will

1287
01:21:58.917 --> 01:22:00.042
Alright then

1288
01:22:00.042 --> 01:22:01.417
Back to the manicure

1289
01:22:01.959 --> 01:22:04.750
Alright, I'll call you back

1290
01:22:05.084 --> 01:22:05.625
Bye-bye

1291
01:22:05.626 --> 01:22:06.376
What do you think?

1292
01:22:06.376 --> 01:22:08.209
It's nice, it matches you

1293
01:22:08.459 --> 01:22:09.500
Babe, what do you think?

1294
01:22:09.792 --> 01:22:11.583
I gotta call someone back, just a sec

1295
01:22:11.626 --> 01:22:14.542
I could help you adjust this part...

1296
01:22:14.751 --> 01:22:16.042
Sorry, wait a second

1297
01:22:16.042 --> 01:22:17.750
Hello? Yes...

1298
01:22:17.751 --> 01:22:18.751
Is this the one?

1299
01:22:19.959 --> 01:22:20.875
It looks nice

1300
01:22:20.876 --> 01:22:23.126
I'll help her adjust
the front, so that she...

1301
01:22:23.126 --> 01:22:24.459
Excuse me

1302
01:22:24.751 --> 01:22:25.834
Alright, bye-bye

1303
01:22:25.834 --> 01:22:27.334
Sorry, where were we?

1304
01:22:27.626 --> 01:22:29.542
I'll help you adjust this part

1305
01:22:29.542 --> 01:22:30.792
Make it lower and tighter

1306
01:22:30.792 --> 01:22:32.083
What? Is that too revealing?

1307
01:22:32.084 --> 01:22:34.000
It can't go any lower

1308
01:22:34.584 --> 01:22:36.375
I only bought that stock last week

1309
01:22:36.542 --> 01:22:37.708
What do you think?

1310
01:22:37.709 --> 01:22:41.084
They won't have time to
have me as their kid

1311
01:22:46.626 --> 01:22:50.126
First of all, how
did you guys start dating?

1312
01:22:51.167 --> 01:22:53.042
A friend introduced us

1313
01:22:53.042 --> 01:22:55.917
We were at a concert together in Japan

1314
01:22:55.917 --> 01:22:58.167
Have we been to a concert in Japan?

1315
01:22:58.292 --> 01:22:59.667
Was it not?

1316
01:22:59.834 --> 01:23:01.209
I must've mixed it up

1317
01:23:01.376 --> 01:23:03.042
Who were you with?

1318
01:23:03.126 --> 01:23:05.376
Why do you care? 
Why are you yelling?

1319
01:23:05.376 --> 01:23:06.876
You're scaring the baby

1320
01:23:07.584 --> 01:23:08.625
It's okay

1321
01:23:08.626 --> 01:23:10.501
We won't be shooting the concert, right?

1322
01:23:10.501 --> 01:23:12.001
Watch your tone with me

1323
01:23:12.126 --> 01:23:14.084
You know that you're
just carrying a girl, right?

1324
01:23:14.126 --> 01:23:16.167
What? So a girl doesn't earn a cut?

1325
01:23:16.167 --> 01:23:18.417
We only get the land
and shares if it's a boy

1326
01:23:18.917 --> 01:23:21.333
Luckily, my brother had a daughter

1327
01:23:22.209 --> 01:23:25.042
Give birth to this one,
and give me a boy

1328
01:23:25.376 --> 01:23:26.834
You're destined to have daughters

1329
01:23:26.834 --> 01:23:28.750
What's that got to do with me?

1330
01:23:28.834 --> 01:23:30.292
Forget it, we're not making the video

1331
01:23:30.292 --> 01:23:32.458
What do you want from me?

1332
01:23:36.209 --> 01:23:37.709
What do you think?

1333
01:23:40.459 --> 01:23:43.000
They're rich, it's a good opportunity

1334
01:23:43.001 --> 01:23:45.709
I don't like them as my parents

1335
01:23:45.709 --> 01:23:48.125
You're running out of choices

1336
01:23:48.126 --> 01:23:49.084
I don't want it

1337
01:23:49.084 --> 01:23:50.584
I'm upset

1338
01:23:54.167 --> 01:23:56.167
Don't be so picky

1339
01:23:56.167 --> 01:23:58.500
I'm not reincarnating

1340
01:24:01.584 --> 01:24:02.875
Iced lemon tea

1341
01:24:03.417 --> 01:24:05.083
Make that two, please

1342
01:24:06.001 --> 01:24:07.251
Johnny

1343
01:24:08.876 --> 01:24:10.209
Keung

1344
01:24:10.542 --> 01:24:12.042
You work here?

1345
01:24:12.042 --> 01:24:14.500
Nah, I'm just helping out

1346
01:24:15.001 --> 01:24:16.417
Still figuring stuff out for your wedding?

1347
01:24:16.709 --> 01:24:18.375
We're almost there

1348
01:24:18.376 --> 01:24:20.667
Just tying up some loose ends

1349
01:24:20.667 --> 01:24:23.000
Also, I want some pictures taken

1350
01:24:24.709 --> 01:24:26.709
This is Johnny, we went to college together

1351
01:24:26.709 --> 01:24:28.209
And this is his girlfriend Mabel

1352
01:24:28.292 --> 01:24:30.958
They've been in a stable relationship for years

1353
01:24:31.667 --> 01:24:32.542
Also...

1354
01:24:32.542 --> 01:24:34.042
They want to have children

1355
01:24:36.834 --> 01:24:39.584
So have you guys planned it out?

1356
01:24:40.042 --> 01:24:41.042
Yeah

1357
01:24:42.209 --> 01:24:44.584
How many are you planning to have?

1358
01:24:44.584 --> 01:24:47.167
I don't mind how many kids we have

1359
01:24:47.167 --> 01:24:48.708
A football team

1360
01:24:48.751 --> 01:24:50.126
You'll be popping out kids

1361
01:24:51.459 --> 01:24:52.167
You've been dating for so long

1362
01:24:52.167 --> 01:24:53.667
How many fights have you had?

1363
01:24:53.959 --> 01:24:56.709
1, 2, 3, less than 10

1364
01:24:56.709 --> 01:24:59.334
They're thinking of moving to Canada

1365
01:24:59.334 --> 01:25:01.209
Yeah, education is better over there

1366
01:25:01.209 --> 01:25:03.292
And the air is better

1367
01:25:03.292 --> 01:25:06.083
But kids might have trouble adapting

1368
01:25:06.417 --> 01:25:09.083
I wonder if she'll like the candy there

1369
01:25:10.626 --> 01:25:11.292
What?

1370
01:25:12.126 --> 01:25:12.751
What?

1371
01:25:13.917 --> 01:25:15.167
Don't think about it too much

1372
01:25:15.167 --> 01:25:16.958
It's the best arrangement

1373
01:25:17.626 --> 01:25:18.751
Let's go with this one, okay?

1374
01:25:19.251 --> 01:25:20.417
Okay?

1375
01:25:21.001 --> 01:25:21.917
Come over to my store

1376
01:25:22.792 --> 01:25:25.542
You asked so many questions

1377
01:25:25.542 --> 01:25:27.292
- Is there a discount?
- Ask again later when you're back


1378
01:25:27.292 --> 01:25:28.708
- Come over...
- Sure


1379
01:25:28.709 --> 01:25:29.750
So he has nothing to do with it?

1380
01:25:29.751 --> 01:25:31.251
I thought you worked here

1381
01:25:31.584 --> 01:25:32.417
Come over here

1382
01:25:32.417 --> 01:25:33.917
I'm sorry...

1383
01:25:34.084 --> 01:25:35.459
So many questions...

1384
01:25:36.792 --> 01:25:38.000
What do you think?

1385
01:25:38.292 --> 01:25:40.708
This couple seems nice, they're flawless

1386
01:25:44.834 --> 01:25:46.459
What is it again?

1387
01:25:47.376 --> 01:25:51.876
I'll miss you, 
I wanna be with you forever

1388
01:25:53.959 --> 01:25:57.750
I can come visit you in Canada

1389
01:25:58.834 --> 01:26:00.625
I don't want that

1390
01:26:12.917 --> 01:26:14.708
Listen to me

1391
01:26:15.376 --> 01:26:18.542
You have to be
good in your next life

1392
01:26:20.084 --> 01:26:22.459
No matter how bad the circumstances

1393
01:26:23.251 --> 01:26:25.459
You have to be true to yourself

1394
01:26:30.542 --> 01:26:31.375
You understand me?

1395
01:26:32.917 --> 01:26:34.417
I understand

1396
01:26:42.917 --> 01:26:45.250
Johnny and Mabel are leaving

1397
01:26:49.792 --> 01:26:53.458
Kat, you can't be so
naughty in the next life

1398
01:26:57.167 --> 01:26:59.250
You have to be nice to them

1399
01:26:59.459 --> 01:27:00.709
If I know you've been naughty

1400
01:27:00.709 --> 01:27:02.584
I'll come and spank your bottom

1401
01:27:05.251 --> 01:27:06.626
Kat

1402
01:27:07.501 --> 01:27:09.376
We'll see each other soon

1403
01:28:22.751 --> 01:28:24.751
So that's it then?

1404
01:28:27.584 --> 01:28:30.834
So... we'll each call our ride

1405
01:28:45.917 --> 01:28:47.292
So...

1406
01:28:47.292 --> 01:28:48.833
Let's keep in touch

1407
01:28:54.417 --> 01:28:56.083
Or...

1408
01:28:56.334 --> 01:28:57.834
What is it?

1409
01:29:00.917 --> 01:29:03.542
Or we could ask everyone out to dinner

1410
01:29:04.209 --> 01:29:05.459
Sure

1411
01:29:05.459 --> 01:29:06.834
See you soon

1412
01:29:08.959 --> 01:29:11.334
Yee, I'm calling my ride downstairs

1413
01:29:15.209 --> 01:29:17.125
What are you doing?

1414
01:29:19.542 --> 01:29:21.667
- There's always a day for parting...
- Go after her...


1415
01:29:21.667 --> 01:29:23.667
Go after her...

1416
01:29:36.501 --> 01:29:37.376
Fong

1417
01:29:43.001 --> 01:29:43.959
I like you

1418
01:29:44.667 --> 01:29:46.625
I've liked you for a long time

1419
01:29:49.001 --> 01:29:50.126
Is this Kat?

1420
01:29:50.376 --> 01:29:51.876
What do you mean?

1421
01:29:54.292 --> 01:29:55.792
What's gotten into you?

1422
01:29:55.917 --> 01:29:57.875
This is so sudden

1423
01:29:58.126 --> 01:30:02.417
I was afraid that
I'd never see you again

1424
01:30:03.501 --> 01:30:05.001
So?

1425
01:30:05.334 --> 01:30:06.834
What do you wanna do?

1426
01:30:10.876 --> 01:30:12.667
I want you to be my girlfriend

1427
01:30:13.584 --> 01:30:14.375
Together with you

1428
01:30:15.292 --> 01:30:16.708
Inseparable

1429
01:30:26.792 --> 01:30:28.292
The Master is here

1430
01:30:28.292 --> 01:30:29.500
Make way

1431
01:30:29.501 --> 01:30:31.251
All ghosts and spirits make way

1432
01:30:31.251 --> 01:30:32.167
Go ahead and make way

1433
01:30:32.167 --> 01:30:34.167
Don't say I didn't warn you

1434
01:30:34.167 --> 01:30:35.208
The Master is on the way

1435
01:30:35.209 --> 01:30:36.417
On the way

1436
01:30:41.542 --> 01:30:42.667
Master

1437
01:30:42.667 --> 01:30:43.667
It's this floor

1438
01:30:43.667 --> 01:30:44.708
It's haunted

1439
01:30:44.709 --> 01:30:45.750
Yes, Master

1440
01:30:46.876 --> 01:30:48.792
What are you three doing here?

1441
01:30:49.042 --> 01:30:51.042
It's none of your
business, get out of here

1442
01:30:51.042 --> 01:30:52.458
This place is sold already

1443
01:30:52.459 --> 01:30:53.959
Please get out of here

1444
01:30:54.084 --> 01:30:54.792
Can't you see we're all packed up?

1445
01:30:54.792 --> 01:30:56.042
What's happening?

1446
01:30:56.042 --> 01:30:57.208
Stop arguing...

1447
01:30:57.209 --> 01:30:59.000
The Master loves you all

1448
01:30:59.251 --> 01:31:01.292
Master, please have mercy

1449
01:31:01.292 --> 01:31:03.042
There are no evil spirits here

1450
01:31:03.042 --> 01:31:04.875
Get rid of all the wandering spirits

1451
01:31:04.876 --> 01:31:07.209
There's no need, there are no ghosts here

1452
01:31:07.209 --> 01:31:07.875
You guys can leave

1453
01:31:07.876 --> 01:31:09.292
Wait!

1454
01:31:09.376 --> 01:31:10.876
There's one left

1455
01:31:11.417 --> 01:31:13.000
A little rascal ghost over there

1456
01:31:18.417 --> 01:31:19.417
It's Kat

1457
01:31:20.542 --> 01:31:21.583
Kat!

1458
01:31:21.709 --> 01:31:22.750
Why are you still here?

1459
01:31:27.042 --> 01:31:27.750

01:32:21.626 --> 01:32:24.417
Fan... you poor thing

1469
01:32:24.417 --> 01:32:25.250
Are you okay?

1470

To the hospital

1471
01:32:26.959 --> 01:32:28.417
Alright, to the hospital

Master, I beg you

1485
01:33:43.292 --> 01:33:44.667
Kat is a friendly ghost

1486
01:33:44.667 --> 01:33:46.625
She's never hurt anybody

1487
01:33:46.751 --> 01:33:48.251
She's gonna be reincarnated soon

1488

Please don't kill her, I beg you

Why didn't you leave?

1492
01:34:02.417 --> 01:34:04.417
I wanna protect you

1493
01:34:04.417 --> 01:34:07.458
I wanna protect this place

1494
01:34:08.542 --> 01:34:11.333
Why are you such a fool?

1495
01:34:13.001 --> 01:34:15.917
It's okay, Fong

1496
01:34:16.584 --> 01:34:19.334
We'll play together in the next life

1497
01:34:19.834 --> 01:34:22.459
Goodbye, you little rascal

1498

Kat

1499
01:34:26.834 --> 01:34:28.334
Kat

1500
01:34:52.167 --> 01:34:55.000
We haven't seen Kat ever since

1501
01:34:55.626 --> 01:34:58.751
But we'd put down a
few pieces of candy every time

1502
01:34:59.334 --> 01:35:01.709
Just for a peace of mind

1503
01:35:13.334 --> 01:35:15.209
You have to behave

1504
01:35:15.209 --> 01:35:17.917
Grandma's gonna come back soon

1505
01:35:17.917 --> 01:35:20.083
Alright, say goodbye to grandma

1506
01:35:20.084 --> 01:35:22.042
Bye-bye, grandma

1507
01:35:22.917 --> 01:35:24.417
Bye-bye

1508
01:35:24.626 --> 01:35:25.459
Bye, mom

1509
01:35:25.709 --> 01:35:26.750
Let's go to bed

1510
01:35:26.751 --> 01:35:28.792
I wanna hear a story

1511
01:35:30.167 --> 01:35:31.667
Alright

1512
01:35:46.917 --> 01:35:50.833
Tenants of the mall moved out eventually

1513
01:35:51.959 --> 01:35:53.459
This is your story

1514
01:35:53.459 --> 01:35:56.084
Stop asking me where you came from, okay?

1515
01:35:57.376 --> 01:35:59.167
Alright, time for bed

1516
01:35:59.584 --> 01:36:00.500
Goodnight

1517
01:36:34.417 --> 01:36:36.833
I wanna protect you
