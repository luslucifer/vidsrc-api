4
00:01:08.843 --> 00:01:10.761
-Take them out of the wagon!
-Yes, sir.


5
00:01:26.569 --> 00:01:27.987
Damn this country,

6
00:01:29.113 --> 00:01:30.906
and damn this weather.

7
00:01:38.664 --> 00:01:39.915
Come on, hurry up.

8
00:01:40.124 --> 00:01:42.501
Move your asses. 
It's freezing here.

9
00:01:44.295 --> 00:01:46.088
You've heard these stories?

10
00:01:46.255 --> 00:01:48.966
That's what I'm thinking.
We better get away from here.


11
00:01:52.845 --> 00:01:54.013
Calm down.

12
00:02:02.146 --> 00:02:04.231
Why does he have
a sack over his head?

13
00:02:04.815 --> 00:02:05.775
No idea.

14
00:02:06.066 --> 00:02:07.443
We got him like this.

15
00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:09.862
Maybe he's a spy?

16
00:02:11.071 --> 00:02:12.364
Take it off of him.

17
00:02:13.115 --> 00:02:14.992
Let's see who he actually is.

18
00:02:25.461 --> 00:02:28.005
Please just be calm, officer.

19
00:02:28.297 --> 00:02:30.549
We are just artists,
just actors,


20
00:02:30.841 --> 00:02:31.967
and we perform...

21
00:02:32.301 --> 00:02:34.553
in hospitals for wounded soldiers.

22
00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:36.764
No, we're not the soldiers. We are...

23
00:02:37.014 --> 00:02:38.265
we're artists.

24
00:02:38.724 --> 00:02:40.267
We're not soldiers.

25
00:02:41.018 --> 00:02:43.604
I don't speak it.
I don't speak German.


26
00:02:44.355 --> 00:02:45.648
And here,

27
00:02:45.815 --> 00:02:47.066
this woman is my wife.

28
00:02:47.399 --> 00:02:49.235
What's the German for kids?

29
00:02:49.944 --> 00:02:52.988
Child! Children! Two children.

30
00:02:53.197 --> 00:02:54.615
Who the hell is he?

31
00:02:54.865 --> 00:02:55.866
Well, he's definitely...

32
00:02:56.408 --> 00:02:57.701
not Hitler.

33
00:02:59.453 --> 00:03:01.413
I think he said they're actors.

34
00:03:01.789 --> 00:03:03.541
They perform theater plays.

35
00:03:04.333 --> 00:03:05.292
Hey, you.

36
00:03:06.001 --> 00:03:07.670
Show us your theater.

37
00:03:08.128 --> 00:03:09.922
But Sergeant,

38
00:03:10.256 --> 00:03:12.424
are we even allowed to shoot Hitler?

39
00:03:12.675 --> 00:03:14.510
I want to see how...

40
00:03:15.177 --> 00:03:18.556
these Communists portray
our leader, okay?


41
00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:21.892
You, scum.

42
00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:24.144
Show us your performance

43
00:03:24.436 --> 00:03:26.647
or I'll shoot you in both your legs.

44
00:03:27.106 --> 00:03:29.733
And then, I'll make you watch us...

45
00:03:30.234 --> 00:03:32.361
kill that bitch of yours.

46
00:03:39.368 --> 00:03:41.328
Do you think he understood it?

47
00:03:41.662 --> 00:03:42.830
Well translate for me.

48
00:03:43.122 --> 00:03:46.208
I can't translate it.
I only know a few Russian words.


49
00:03:46.917 --> 00:03:49.211
Translate.
That's an order.


50
00:03:52.548 --> 00:03:53.507
Show me.

51
00:03:54.675 --> 00:03:56.093
Show us. Show us.

52
00:03:57.177 --> 00:03:58.721
But, but, show, show what?

53
00:03:58.888 --> 00:04:00.806
What can we show? 
Show him what?

54
00:04:02.725 --> 00:04:03.684
Show.

55
00:04:05.352 --> 00:04:06.854
Maybe, 'theater'?

56
00:04:07.438 --> 00:04:09.064
Show us some theater.

57
00:04:09.231 --> 00:04:10.566
Theater? Theater!

58
00:04:10.733 --> 00:04:13.235
Theater. He wants us to show theater.

59
00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:16.030
I understand. I would need...

60
00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:17.740
one, one minute.

61
00:04:17.907 --> 00:04:18.866
Thank you.

62
00:04:19.283 --> 00:04:22.703
-Hey, Lyonya. They'll kill us for this.
-Ninochka, shh.


63
00:04:23.412 --> 00:04:24.872
Listen to me. Yeah.

64
00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:28.000
Look, it's our chance.

65
00:04:28.208 --> 00:04:29.376
Maybe our only hope.

66
00:04:29.585 --> 00:04:31.795
He said,
maybe they'll let us go. I'll do it.


67
00:04:32.922 --> 00:04:35.424
Yeah? Nina, I love you so much.

68
00:04:59.531 --> 00:05:00.991
Attention, attention.

69
00:05:04.286 --> 00:05:05.329
Germany...

70
00:05:05.871 --> 00:05:06.956
above all!

71
00:05:07.998 --> 00:05:09.875
It is our new...

72
00:05:10.376 --> 00:05:11.418
actor.

73
00:05:12.336 --> 00:05:13.420
Germany...

74
00:05:13.796 --> 00:05:15.047
actor!

75
00:05:15.673 --> 00:05:18.842
Our new cantaloupe,
without cantaloupe,


76
00:05:19.009 --> 00:05:21.136
without, this is Germany!

77
00:05:21.679 --> 00:05:23.263
Don't shoot.

78
00:05:23.472 --> 00:05:25.724
These. There he is.

79
00:05:25.975 --> 00:05:29.144
74, 21,

80
00:05:29.436 --> 00:05:32.231
-What's he babbling?
-No idea.


81
00:05:32.398 --> 00:05:34.566
I don't understand.
Is he mad?


82
00:05:35.192 --> 00:05:37.236
Germany, above all!

83
00:05:37.945 --> 00:05:38.904
Heil!

84
00:05:39.905 --> 00:05:41.115
Don't shoot.

85
00:05:41.281 --> 00:05:44.076
-Don't shoot. Don't--
-Stop it. They'll kill us for this.


86
00:05:44.493 --> 00:05:45.452
Stop!

87
00:05:46.745 --> 00:05:48.163
That is not funny.

88
00:05:48.872 --> 00:05:51.125
Now I'm gonna show you real theater!

89
00:05:51.709 --> 00:05:52.668
Attention!

90
00:05:55.254 --> 00:05:57.047
Present arms! Aim!

91
00:06:04.638 --> 00:06:06.056
Lord, please have mercy.

92
00:06:09.309 --> 00:06:11.103
-Where is he?
- I don't see anything.


93
00:06:58.734 --> 00:06:59.693
See?

94
00:07:00.235 --> 00:07:02.321
And people don't believe in God!

95
00:07:05.532 --> 00:07:06.825
But God exists!

96
00:07:18.295 --> 00:07:19.254
Thank you.

97
00:07:22.007 --> 00:07:23.050
Thank you so much.

98
00:07:23.383 --> 00:07:24.802
Thank you so very much.

99
00:07:25.135 --> 00:07:26.095
Where--

100
00:07:26.762 --> 00:07:28.347
Where are you from? Did you...

101
00:07:29.765 --> 00:07:31.350
and where are the others?

102
00:07:31.642 --> 00:07:34.103
Are you alone? You're alone?

103
00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:36.563
They caught me and my wife.

104
00:07:37.564 --> 00:07:38.899
It happened yesterday.

105
00:07:39.191 --> 00:07:41.235
We were just driving,
and they stopped us.


106
00:07:41.485 --> 00:07:43.320
And they killed the...
the driver.


107
00:07:43.487 --> 00:07:44.738
His name was Yura.

108
00:07:44.905 --> 00:07:46.365
<i>They killed our driver, Yura!</i>

109
00:07:46.615 --> 00:07:47.866
They just killed him.

110
00:07:50.035 --> 00:07:52.663
The fascists-- Don't worry
that I look like Hitler.


111
00:07:52.830 --> 00:07:53.789
We're actors.

112
00:07:53.997 --> 00:07:56.500
We perform in military hospitals,
you see?


113
00:07:57.251 --> 00:07:59.169
And I really, really hate Hitler.

114
00:07:59.711 --> 00:08:01.880
I really hate that piece of scum,
you know?


115
00:08:02.548 --> 00:08:03.507
Thank you.

116
00:08:03.841 --> 00:08:05.175
And I don't want--

117
00:08:07.010 --> 00:08:08.512
Please wait! Please!

118
00:08:14.852 --> 00:08:16.186
Just tell us your name!

119
00:11:43.977 --> 00:11:44.936
Stand up.

120
00:11:46.104 --> 00:11:47.064
Stand up!

121
00:11:48.231 --> 00:11:49.191
Now.

122
00:12:05.791 --> 00:12:07.000
No dirty tricks.

123
00:12:11.129 --> 00:12:12.923
Konstantin, search him.

124
00:12:21.181 --> 00:12:22.349
I'm friendly.

125
00:12:24.976 --> 00:12:26.269
I'm a friend.

126
00:12:26.603 --> 00:12:27.687
Well, we'll see,

127
00:12:28.021 --> 00:12:28.980
won't we?

128
00:12:30.982 --> 00:12:32.317
What are you smirking at?

129
00:12:32.859 --> 00:12:33.819
Move.

130
00:12:36.321 --> 00:12:37.406
Move your ass.

131
00:12:46.248 --> 00:12:47.332
I wish it was summer,

132
00:12:47.666 --> 00:12:50.043
and we'd all go to
my house by the sea.

133
00:12:50.210 --> 00:12:52.170
Imagine it's a lovely hot day.

134
00:12:52.754 --> 00:12:55.549
Your feet, they stick to the sand,
cause it's so hot,


135
00:12:55.715 --> 00:12:56.758
scorching hot.

136
00:12:56.967 --> 00:12:59.052
And the sea,,
it feels warm like fresh milk.


137
00:12:59.469 --> 00:13:01.012
Then you run back to the house,

138
00:13:01.179 --> 00:13:03.223
where there's a huge keg,
and it's full...


139
00:13:03.473 --> 00:13:05.600
of cold beer.
You fill a glass full,


140
00:13:05.767 --> 00:13:07.060
and drink it in one gulp.

141
00:13:07.602 --> 00:13:08.687
But right now,

142
00:13:09.187 --> 00:13:11.648
I'd even make do with a warm beer.

143
00:13:14.943 --> 00:13:16.778
Don't fire. It's just us.

144
00:13:17.779 --> 00:13:18.780
-Commander,
-What?


145
00:13:18.947 --> 00:13:20.991
We found him in the woods,
frozen to hell.


146
00:13:21.616 --> 00:13:22.617
Go sit down.

147
00:13:23.660 --> 00:13:24.703
Is he German?

148
00:13:25.579 --> 00:13:27.330
Looks like one of ours, Russian.

149
00:13:27.497 --> 00:13:29.708
Can we use his greatcoat,
you think?


150
00:13:30.292 --> 00:13:31.960
Sergeant, remove his coat.

151
00:13:37.090 --> 00:13:38.049
Here.

152
00:13:40.385 --> 00:13:41.386
Here, have some.

153
00:13:41.553 --> 00:13:43.346
Don't anyone relax just yet.

154
00:13:44.347 --> 00:13:45.474
Be ready to set off.

155
00:13:46.892 --> 00:13:49.019
Come on, move your asses.
Move your asses!


156
00:13:55.859 --> 00:13:57.235
Why did you bring him?

157
00:13:57.861 --> 00:13:59.529
You could've shot him on the spot.

158
00:14:00.989 --> 00:14:02.574
Shot him?

159
00:14:03.241 --> 00:14:04.534
So why would I shoot him?

160
00:14:05.368 --> 00:14:06.912
Without knowing more about him?

161
00:14:08.205 --> 00:14:10.123
And what if he
really is one of ours?

162
00:14:10.499 --> 00:14:12.959
We've seen
that sort of 'ours' before.


163
00:14:13.627 --> 00:14:14.586
Deserter.

164
00:14:16.254 --> 00:14:17.380
And what are you then?

165
00:14:18.882 --> 00:14:21.092
Lieutenant,
you think you could carry him now?


166
00:14:22.135 --> 00:14:23.136
Put him down.

167
00:14:26.473 --> 00:14:27.516
My back.

168
00:14:29.351 --> 00:14:31.645
Save your strength,
you shouldn't talk so much.


169
00:14:31.937 --> 00:14:33.605
Oh, come on. Don't be ridiculous.

170
00:14:33.813 --> 00:14:34.773
Ready?

171
00:14:35.232 --> 00:14:37.692
Talking is not such a big deal.

172
00:16:09.326 --> 00:16:10.493
Do you have a smoke?

173
00:16:16.791 --> 00:16:19.544
Just try to keep still.

174
00:16:20.337 --> 00:16:22.088
We'll take you to the hospital.

175
00:16:22.422 --> 00:16:25.091
Now keep still.
Your wound may open up again.


176
00:16:28.928 --> 00:16:30.305
How much longer?

177
00:16:31.181 --> 00:16:32.349
If God grants it,

178
00:16:34.476 --> 00:16:36.478
we'll reach my friend by dinner tomorrow.

179
00:16:37.228 --> 00:16:39.022
And will your friend have moonshine?

180
00:16:39.189 --> 00:16:40.982
That's the only thing
you care about?


181
00:16:41.983 --> 00:16:43.526
<i>-I'm pouring out my--
-Sergeant,</i>


182
00:16:43.693 --> 00:16:45.278
just stop this talking.

183
00:16:48.073 --> 00:16:49.491
What sort of person are you?

184
00:16:49.783 --> 00:16:52.035
Always talking, talking, talking.

185
00:16:52.369 --> 00:16:54.120
It's just my character, Lieutenant.

186
00:16:56.665 --> 00:16:58.583
I know a story about character.

187
00:17:00.669 --> 00:17:03.463
The Germans, they were going to shoot
three captives.


188
00:17:03.630 --> 00:17:05.173
They put them against the wall.

189
00:17:06.257 --> 00:17:07.300
A Russian,

190
00:17:07.967 --> 00:17:10.011
Englishman, and a Frenchman.

191
00:17:11.179 --> 00:17:12.430
Those Germans,

192
00:17:12.639 --> 00:17:13.848
kind as they are,

193
00:17:14.265 --> 00:17:16.434
offered to fulfill their last wishes.

194
00:17:17.560 --> 00:17:18.978
The Englishman asked for...

195
00:17:19.354 --> 00:17:20.313
whisky.

196
00:17:22.023 --> 00:17:24.442
Well they brought whisky
and he swigged it down.


197
00:17:24.818 --> 00:17:27.278
The Frenchman says,
“I'd like some Champagne.”


198
00:17:27.696 --> 00:17:29.698
And so they gave him champagne.

199
00:17:30.532 --> 00:17:31.700
“And you Mr. Russian.

200
00:17:32.075 --> 00:17:33.535
What's your last wish?”

201
00:17:33.868 --> 00:17:36.121
He says “My wish is like this,

202
00:17:36.621 --> 00:17:39.499
I want someone to come
and give me a big kick in the ass.”


203
00:17:40.083 --> 00:17:43.420
They said, "And this is really
your last wish, you oaf?”


204
00:17:43.586 --> 00:17:44.963
"Of course,” he replied.

205
00:17:46.047 --> 00:17:48.174
So the fattest kraut in all of Germany,

206
00:17:48.842 --> 00:17:53.054
he kicks him hard, right in the ass,
and the Russian flies like a cannonball,


207
00:17:53.263 --> 00:17:56.015
and ricochets against the wall
and back into the fatso.


208
00:17:56.307 --> 00:17:57.642
He grabs his machine gun,

209
00:17:58.226 --> 00:17:59.644
and shoots the Germans dead.

210
00:18:00.186 --> 00:18:01.396
The prisoners, well,

211
00:18:01.646 --> 00:18:02.647
they run away.

212
00:18:03.106 --> 00:18:04.482
And the Englishman asks,

213
00:18:04.858 --> 00:18:07.652
“Why didn't you just grab his gun
at the start?”


214
00:18:09.779 --> 00:18:11.656
"It's just my character.”

215
00:18:12.031 --> 00:18:12.991
You see?

216
00:18:14.659 --> 00:18:17.078
Unless we Russians get
a kick in the ass,

217
00:18:17.245 --> 00:18:18.538
we won't move a finger.

218
00:18:20.165 --> 00:18:21.875
I have a similar anecdote but...

219
00:18:22.125 --> 00:18:23.084
but it...

220
00:18:23.251 --> 00:18:24.377
has a different ending.

221
00:18:24.544 --> 00:18:27.964
The same characters are captured
and they're offered a last wish.


222
00:18:28.256 --> 00:18:29.507
<i>The krauts, they say,</i>

223
00:18:29.966 --> 00:18:32.427
“Right, the one who can hit this sparrow

224
00:18:32.719 --> 00:18:33.928
will be released.”

225
00:18:34.387 --> 00:18:36.431
A glass is filled with Champagne,

226
00:18:36.639 --> 00:18:39.392
the Frenchman drinks it
and carefully takes aim.


227
00:18:39.684 --> 00:18:41.352
-Kolya.
-And he misses the sparrow.


228
00:18:41.561 --> 00:18:43.772
They kill him.
Same with the Englishman.


229
00:18:43.938 --> 00:18:45.356
And the Russian,
the Russian,


230
00:18:45.523 --> 00:18:48.234
he asks his German captors
for a whole bottle of vodka--


231
00:18:49.402 --> 00:18:50.361
Kolya?

232
00:18:52.614 --> 00:18:53.573
Kolya?

233
00:18:54.866 --> 00:18:55.825
Kolya!

234
00:18:56.117 --> 00:18:57.076
Kolya!

235
00:18:57.368 --> 00:18:58.912
Don't you, don't you dare!

236
00:18:59.078 --> 00:19:01.998
No! Don't you dare!
Come on then, help him!


237
00:19:02.373 --> 00:19:04.042
Will you just help him?

238
00:19:04.542 --> 00:19:06.252
Come on! No!

239
00:19:06.586 --> 00:19:09.005
Kolya, please don't go. 
I'm begging you.

240
00:19:09.380 --> 00:19:11.132
-Kolya!
-His soul...


241
00:19:12.008 --> 00:19:13.301
has passed over.

242
00:19:13.635 --> 00:19:14.677
Kolya!

243
00:19:42.622 --> 00:19:44.207
So beautiful here.

244
00:19:46.209 --> 00:19:48.086
In total, sixty-one victims,

245
00:19:48.378 --> 00:19:50.213
in a matter of
two and a half months.

246
00:19:50.839 --> 00:19:51.798
What makes you think

247
00:19:51.965 --> 00:19:54.425
that all these dead are connected
with each other?


248
00:19:55.176 --> 00:19:56.302
The same signature.

249
00:19:56.511 --> 00:19:59.722
We think it's likely that
there's a solitary sniper at work here.


250
00:19:59.889 --> 00:20:02.517
Our soldiers started to call him
"Red Ghost."”


251
00:20:03.852 --> 00:20:07.272
And you mean to tell me that
you can't liquidate a single shooter?


252
00:20:07.438 --> 00:20:09.023
Have I understood it correctly?

253
00:20:11.359 --> 00:20:14.195
Well, now it's your job,
Commander.


254
00:20:14.404 --> 00:20:16.239
Klein will brief you on the details.

255
00:20:17.532 --> 00:20:18.533
Best of luck.

256
00:20:28.710 --> 00:20:29.878
Tell me then,

257
00:20:30.503 --> 00:20:32.589
who is this Red Ghost?

258
00:21:24.307 --> 00:21:25.266
Where's my gun?

259
00:21:25.433 --> 00:21:27.060
Mine now. Got a smoke?

260
00:21:29.938 --> 00:21:31.230
I have a smoke.

261
00:21:34.984 --> 00:21:36.110
Give it back then.

262
00:21:52.669 --> 00:21:54.087
Been on the go long?

263
00:21:57.215 --> 00:21:58.424
Quite some time.

264
00:21:59.467 --> 00:22:00.802
Since we broke through,

265
00:22:00.969 --> 00:22:03.096
<i>we're on the go all the time.</i>

266
00:22:04.847 --> 00:22:06.641
It'll be easier soon.

267
00:22:07.016 --> 00:22:08.142
Once we kill you--

268
00:22:13.606 --> 00:22:15.775
Don't be stupid. Just a joke.

269
00:22:16.484 --> 00:22:17.443
Here.

270
00:22:23.032 --> 00:22:25.618
But if you start acting stupid again,
I'll shoot you.


271
00:22:26.035 --> 00:22:27.453
-Got me?
-Yeah.


272
00:22:33.793 --> 00:22:34.752
Hey,

273
00:22:35.044 --> 00:22:36.004
soldiers!

274
00:22:36.379 --> 00:22:37.463
Stop that snoozing!

275
00:22:37.714 --> 00:22:38.673
Reveille!

276
00:22:40.425 --> 00:22:41.384
Konstantin,

277
00:22:41.718 --> 00:22:42.760
come here.

278
00:22:43.803 --> 00:22:45.179
Come on guys, hurry up.

279
00:22:45.805 --> 00:22:47.265
We haven't got far to go.

280
00:22:55.773 --> 00:22:56.774
And?

281
00:22:58.735 --> 00:22:59.777
No-one out there.

282
00:23:04.115 --> 00:23:05.199
Not a soul.

283
00:23:21.340 --> 00:23:23.009
Check the barn, Kostya.

284
00:23:52.371 --> 00:23:53.456
Call the guys.

285
00:24:15.686 --> 00:24:16.813
What are you doing?

286
00:24:19.273 --> 00:24:20.441
-Are you nuts?
-Hey!


287
00:24:21.651 --> 00:24:22.860
What the hell's going on?

288
00:24:23.111 --> 00:24:24.445
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

289
00:24:24.821 --> 00:24:26.447
Just calm down!

290
00:24:26.739 --> 00:24:28.157
Are you crazy?

291
00:24:32.912 --> 00:24:35.581
Don't interfere, Pops!
Did you see what he did?


292
00:24:35.873 --> 00:24:37.125
What are you doing?

293
00:24:38.334 --> 00:24:39.293
Idiot!

294
00:24:40.336 --> 00:24:42.004
He saved your damned life!

295
00:24:43.214 --> 00:24:45.383
My friend never kept vodka here.

296
00:24:46.175 --> 00:24:49.554
Everything's poisoned. A trap laid by
the fascists for the Partisans,


297
00:24:49.720 --> 00:24:51.139
or maybe it's that avenger.

298
00:24:51.764 --> 00:24:53.224
Ten people in the village...

299
00:24:53.850 --> 00:24:56.811
have died after stupidly drinking
this vile liquid.


300
00:24:56.978 --> 00:24:59.897
You should thank him
for saving your life. Not fighting him.


301
00:25:00.064 --> 00:25:01.023
Idiot.

302
00:25:07.321 --> 00:25:08.948
Why would they do that?

303
00:25:15.371 --> 00:25:17.832
Don't look so pleased.
It's all been poisoned.


304
00:25:18.207 --> 00:25:19.458
Even the vodka.

305
00:25:20.084 --> 00:25:21.711
A gift from them Germans.

306
00:25:22.378 --> 00:25:24.714
When are we going to eat properly?

307
00:25:26.048 --> 00:25:28.134
Try to find some clean clothes for me.

308
00:25:28.384 --> 00:25:30.678
Why are you standing there?
Look in the chest.


309
00:25:31.012 --> 00:25:31.971
So good.

310
00:25:32.763 --> 00:25:33.931
So good.

311
00:25:47.153 --> 00:25:48.988
What's up? What you looking at?

312
00:25:49.280 --> 00:25:51.157
Never seen a pregnant woman before?

313
00:25:57.747 --> 00:25:58.706
How?

314
00:25:59.707 --> 00:26:01.083
What are you talking about?

315
00:26:02.543 --> 00:26:04.587
Don't you know how babies are made?

316
00:26:14.722 --> 00:26:16.349
I'm such a fool.

317
00:26:16.682 --> 00:26:17.683
Will this do?

318
00:26:18.267 --> 00:26:19.352
That'll do it.

319
00:26:44.210 --> 00:26:45.419
Three days ago,

320
00:26:45.628 --> 00:26:47.046
six of our best men
were killed in Nizovskaya.


321
00:26:47.255 --> 00:26:49.173
Then, in the village of Ivanovo,

322
00:26:49.840 --> 00:26:51.259
two of our men were killed.

323
00:26:53.261 --> 00:26:54.637
In the last big battle...

324
00:26:56.180 --> 00:26:57.682
that took place in the village

325
00:26:58.140 --> 00:26:59.517
of Lenskoye.

326
00:27:00.434 --> 00:27:02.728
-They killed sixteen men.
-Do you like 'Banya'?


327
00:27:02.937 --> 00:27:04.939
-Excuse me?
-Banya.


328
00:27:05.398 --> 00:27:07.233
Like a sauna, but with steam.

329
00:27:09.026 --> 00:27:11.487
To be honest, not really.

330
00:27:12.113 --> 00:27:14.198
What, not even in such a frost?

331
00:27:16.075 --> 00:27:18.411
Have you heard of '
Black Banya' at all?

332
00:27:19.328 --> 00:27:21.455
Yes. There's one nearby.

333
00:27:22.790 --> 00:27:24.333
German sauna is nice,

334
00:27:24.542 --> 00:27:27.086
but 'Black Banya" is a real challenge.

335
00:27:27.295 --> 00:27:28.879
Banya's a passion.

336
00:27:29.255 --> 00:27:32.550
In weather such as this,
it warms you to the very bone.


337
00:27:33.509 --> 00:27:35.636
Which says a lot about the Russians.

338
00:27:36.512 --> 00:27:38.055
You should study your enemy.

339
00:27:38.639 --> 00:27:39.724
How they live.

340
00:27:40.016 --> 00:27:41.183
How they think.

341
00:27:41.934 --> 00:27:43.227
How they wash themselves.

342
00:27:43.519 --> 00:27:44.562
[Braun laughs]

343
00:27:45.062 --> 00:27:47.023
The Russians love extremes.

344
00:27:47.231 --> 00:27:48.941
They have a rather hard life.

345
00:27:49.108 --> 00:27:51.819
[Klein laughs] Well,
they have no choice really do they?


346
00:27:52.028 --> 00:27:53.571
[Braun laughs] Oh but they do.

347
00:27:54.030 --> 00:27:55.281
Where is that bath house?

348
00:27:55.489 --> 00:27:56.741
Not far from here.

349
00:27:57.158 --> 00:27:58.701
So, is this sector cleared?

350
00:27:59.201 --> 00:28:00.870
Yes sir, this is my sector.

351
00:28:01.203 --> 00:28:02.455
No enemy here.

352
00:28:02.788 --> 00:28:04.123
Well, then let's go.

353
00:28:05.082 --> 00:28:06.042
Comrade!

354
00:28:06.917 --> 00:28:07.877
Stop!

355
00:28:09.962 --> 00:28:11.589
<i>Don't move anything on the table.</i>

356
00:28:11.922 --> 00:28:13.924
Now listen carefully to the orders.

357
00:28:14.675 --> 00:28:15.926
We'll go to the village,

358
00:28:16.218 --> 00:28:17.678
and we will look for products,

359
00:28:17.928 --> 00:28:19.347
such as matches and the like.

360
00:28:19.847 --> 00:28:20.806
After this,

361
00:28:21.349 --> 00:28:22.391
we'll move on.

362
00:28:22.558 --> 00:28:23.684
You've time for a rest.

363
00:28:23.851 --> 00:28:24.810
No.

364
00:28:25.102 --> 00:28:26.187
I'll go with you.

365
00:28:27.271 --> 00:28:29.148
-You'll stay with her.
-[Simpleton] Me?


366
00:28:30.024 --> 00:28:30.983
No, him.

367
00:28:31.359 --> 00:28:33.235
Sergeant, nod your head when I speak.

368
00:28:33.527 --> 00:28:34.570
[Sailor] Of course.

369
00:28:36.989 --> 00:28:38.449
[suspenseful music]

370
00:29:19.615 --> 00:29:20.783
[Vera gasps]

371
00:29:25.121 --> 00:29:26.747
[soldiers speaking]

372
00:29:55.276 --> 00:29:57.069
[soldiers shouting]

373
00:30:26.891 --> 00:30:28.058
[Klein] Shit!

374
00:30:30.352 --> 00:30:31.479
It's steamy here.

375
00:30:31.770 --> 00:30:32.730
[soldier 2] No.

376
00:30:33.647 --> 00:30:34.648
[Klein] God!

377
00:30:43.616 --> 00:30:44.742
Good job.

378
00:30:47.286 --> 00:30:48.370
[Klein] Come in.

379
00:30:54.502 --> 00:30:55.878
What are you staring at?

380
00:30:59.924 --> 00:31:01.550
How do you like my still-life?

381
00:31:01.967 --> 00:31:03.802
-Your idea?
-Yes,


382
00:31:04.011 --> 00:31:05.846
and it seems to work as well.

383
00:31:06.347 --> 00:31:08.557
We killed four soldiers last week.

384
00:31:16.357 --> 00:31:18.150
Look at this, Commander.

385
00:31:19.401 --> 00:31:21.362
The Russians pray to two gods.

386
00:31:23.322 --> 00:31:25.366
You think it's any different for us?

387
00:31:26.534 --> 00:31:28.285
I'm sorry. Clear the table.

388
00:31:32.164 --> 00:31:34.959
The food here is making me hungry.
Organize something, Klein.


389
00:31:35.376 --> 00:31:37.086
Already on the way.

390
00:31:37.628 --> 00:31:39.129
Boys, hurry it up!

391
00:31:57.773 --> 00:31:59.108
Be quiet. Stop.

392
00:31:59.692 --> 00:32:00.651
Stop there.

393
00:32:00.901 --> 00:32:03.028
-It's the Germans.
-[Pops] Holy shit.


394
00:32:03.320 --> 00:32:04.321
Where's Vera?

395
00:32:04.488 --> 00:32:05.447
Back at the house.

396
00:32:05.698 --> 00:32:07.032
You disobeyed my order.

397
00:32:07.783 --> 00:32:10.452
You want me to fight alone,
is that it? Just me, eh?


398
00:32:12.079 --> 00:32:14.498
30 Germans, and I've got 30 bullets.

399
00:32:14.873 --> 00:32:16.625
I just stepped out to take a piss--

400
00:32:16.792 --> 00:32:18.043
Looking for moonshine.

401
00:32:18.252 --> 00:32:19.878
You really are a son of a bitch.

402
00:32:20.296 --> 00:32:22.172
So what if I was? 
What's your problem?

403
00:32:23.299 --> 00:32:24.675
What you gonna do, shoot me?

404
00:32:30.431 --> 00:32:32.057
So what do we do now?

405
00:32:45.195 --> 00:32:46.155
Hey,

406
00:32:46.488 --> 00:32:47.448
Gunther!

407
00:32:47.948 --> 00:32:49.742
Here, look at this.

408
00:32:50.075 --> 00:32:51.076
[Gunther laughs]

409
00:32:51.910 --> 00:32:53.120
A present...

410
00:32:53.871 --> 00:32:55.623
from the Eastern Front.

411
00:32:58.208 --> 00:33:00.794
[soldiers laughing]

412
00:33:01.128 --> 00:33:03.088
We should take a photo.

413
00:33:04.465 --> 00:33:07.092
-Great. Take your places.
-Hey, give it to me.


414
00:33:07.593 --> 00:33:08.719
Hold it.

415
00:33:08.969 --> 00:33:10.346
Are we taking this photo?

416
00:33:11.096 --> 00:33:12.473
Right, all stand together.

417
00:33:13.265 --> 00:33:15.142
All right, now. Yeah.

418
00:33:16.852 --> 00:33:18.520
Can't you hold the piglet eh?

419
00:33:20.314 --> 00:33:22.024
[soldier laughing]

420
00:33:22.941 --> 00:33:24.109
Let it go.

421
00:33:24.568 --> 00:33:26.195
No. Why? You wanna dance with it?

422
00:33:28.030 --> 00:33:29.990
A dance with a Russian beauty.

423
00:33:30.157 --> 00:33:31.325
[soldiers laughing]

424
00:33:36.163 --> 00:33:39.500
[soldiers singing]

425
00:33:46.090 --> 00:33:48.217
[tense music]

426
00:33:49.551 --> 00:33:50.636
Was that Vera?

427
00:33:51.470 --> 00:33:53.138
Just them morons having fun.

428
00:33:58.977 --> 00:34:00.771
One doesn't play with food.

429
00:34:09.196 --> 00:34:11.198
You have problems with discipline.

430
00:34:11.573 --> 00:34:13.409
Don't be so strict with them.

431
00:34:13.659 --> 00:34:16.370
The soldiers are tired and need some fun.

432
00:34:17.413 --> 00:34:19.164
Not the soldiers.

433
00:34:19.498 --> 00:34:21.500
Only officers are entitled.

434
00:34:29.758 --> 00:34:31.093
Three men in the trench.

435
00:34:35.013 --> 00:34:37.474
Sixteen in the yard.
Who knows how many inside.


436
00:34:38.809 --> 00:34:39.893
Not 30, for sure.

437
00:34:40.060 --> 00:34:41.019
Oh, come on.

438
00:34:43.522 --> 00:34:44.481
We'll wait.

439
00:34:45.357 --> 00:34:46.316
How long?

440
00:34:48.360 --> 00:34:50.654
Pops, keep your eyes on the farm,

441
00:34:50.863 --> 00:34:52.781
and report about any movements you see.

442
00:34:53.031 --> 00:34:55.701
-With God's will, they'll leave.
-And if they don't go?


443
00:34:56.702 --> 00:34:58.287
Then we'll act accordingly.

444
00:34:58.996 --> 00:35:00.205
Check the ammunition.

445
00:35:00.497 --> 00:35:01.457
We move out at dusk,

446
00:35:01.749 --> 00:35:02.958
if she's still alive.

447
00:35:12.926 --> 00:35:14.178
Tell me, Klein,

448
00:35:15.888 --> 00:35:17.973
do you also believe in this Ghost?

449
00:35:19.516 --> 00:35:20.476
Don't know.

450
00:35:20.684 --> 00:35:22.728
To be honest, I don't. But...

451
00:35:23.020 --> 00:35:24.313
according to witnesses,

452
00:35:24.646 --> 00:35:26.148
he comes out of the blue,

453
00:35:26.440 --> 00:35:28.692
and is unusually strong and brave.

454
00:35:33.781 --> 00:35:35.616
The Russians have a saying,

455
00:35:37.075 --> 00:35:38.994
"Fear has big eyes".

456
00:35:40.454 --> 00:35:43.123
And this barbarous ritual,
with the torn-off epaulets,


457
00:35:43.957 --> 00:35:46.084
it is simply a provocation
by the Partisans.


458
00:35:46.293 --> 00:35:48.170
I don't think
the peasants would lie.


459
00:35:49.421 --> 00:35:51.340
People don't lie
at the threshold of death.


460
00:35:55.177 --> 00:35:56.762
-[Vera gasps]
- It is okay.


461
00:35:57.805 --> 00:35:59.598
If he is really as you describe him,

462
00:36:00.015 --> 00:36:01.475
then I'd like to meet him.

463
00:36:04.436 --> 00:36:06.647
It's uncomfortable here
'cause it's so cold.


464
00:36:07.022 --> 00:36:07.981
[Klein] Gunther,

465
00:36:08.273 --> 00:36:09.233
get to work.

466
00:36:09.525 --> 00:36:10.484
Yes, sir.

467
00:36:14.321 --> 00:36:16.240
[soldiers talking]

468
00:36:18.242 --> 00:36:20.285
Koch, when is it ready?

469
00:36:20.702 --> 00:36:21.995
Don't you worry.

470
00:36:22.663 --> 00:36:24.665
-It's all getting sorted.
-Get a move on!


471
00:36:24.915 --> 00:36:26.083
I'm getting hungry.

472
00:36:26.458 --> 00:36:27.835
Can't wait much longer.

473
00:36:28.001 --> 00:36:30.337
It would go quicker
if you stopped pestering me.


474
00:36:44.768 --> 00:36:47.104
[Pops] Can't see a thing
through this damn snow.


475
00:36:50.357 --> 00:36:51.817
Hey, frozen boy.

476
00:36:52.401 --> 00:36:53.694
Come over here.

477
00:37:00.492 --> 00:37:01.451
Here.

478
00:37:01.952 --> 00:37:03.036
Now you watch.

479
00:37:03.829 --> 00:37:05.539
I can't see well from this far.

480
00:37:07.374 --> 00:37:09.084
Make sure you pay attention.

481
00:37:10.294 --> 00:37:12.212
-Firing up the bathhouse.
-You're sure?


482
00:37:12.504 --> 00:37:13.547
The bathhouse?

483
00:37:14.840 --> 00:37:16.049
The Germans?

484
00:37:17.175 --> 00:37:18.719
Well, I'll be damned.

485
00:37:20.679 --> 00:37:22.389
I hope you roast here, Braun.

486
00:37:24.099 --> 00:37:25.350
[Gunther sighs]

487
00:37:28.604 --> 00:37:30.647
-What's wrong with his eye?
-Huh?


488
00:37:31.023 --> 00:37:32.024
Battle wound?

489
00:37:32.357 --> 00:37:33.901
No, it's not a battle wound.

490
00:37:34.359 --> 00:37:35.444
As a kid,

491
00:37:36.153 --> 00:37:38.614
he was stealing apples
from someone's garden.


492
00:37:38.906 --> 00:37:41.408
The owner came out
and shot his rifle in the air.


493
00:37:41.617 --> 00:37:42.910
The kids, they jumped down

494
00:37:43.118 --> 00:37:44.244
from the apple tree.

495
00:37:44.578 --> 00:37:46.455
But he fell, from the very top.

496
00:37:46.955 --> 00:37:48.624
A branch went through his eye.

497
00:37:52.502 --> 00:37:53.545
And it was...

498
00:37:53.879 --> 00:37:54.880
my garden.

499
00:37:57.507 --> 00:37:58.717
So now I kinda...

500
00:37:59.635 --> 00:38:01.136
feel responsible for him,

501
00:38:02.012 --> 00:38:03.180
in front of the Lord.

502
00:38:03.388 --> 00:38:04.932
It's just how it is.

503
00:38:06.433 --> 00:38:08.018
[Pops laughs] But it turns out,

504
00:38:08.435 --> 00:38:09.853
he's an excellent hunter.

[Pops laughs]

506
00:38:13.231 --> 00:38:15.067
What are we doing just sitting here?

507
00:38:15.400 --> 00:38:16.735
And what do you suggest?

508
00:38:17.611 --> 00:38:18.654
Have a death wish?

509
00:38:21.114 --> 00:38:22.824
We need to act cleverly,

510
00:38:23.700 --> 00:38:25.369
like, say, that Ghost.

511
00:38:26.328 --> 00:38:27.287
Who?

512
00:38:28.205 --> 00:38:29.414
The Red Ghost.

513
00:38:31.041 --> 00:38:34.378
The sauna is ready in one hour.

514
00:38:35.212 --> 00:38:38.215
If I were you, I would think twice
before going to the sauna.


515
00:38:38.465 --> 00:38:40.133
Maybe it's not a good idea.

516
00:38:40.550 --> 00:38:42.678
-Firstly, it's "Black Banya'.
-[tense music]

00:38:44.471 --> 00:38:46.306
Secondly, you are not me.

518
00:38:46.473 --> 00:38:47.432
You misunderstood--

519
00:38:47.599 --> 00:38:49.893
Thirdly,
you don't have authority to interrupt!


520
00:38:50.102 --> 00:38:51.269
Yes, Commander.

521
00:38:53.188 --> 00:38:54.147
Get up!

00:38:54.314 --> 00:38:55.941
[tense music intensifies]

523

[Vera gasps]

524
00:38:59.653 --> 00:39:01.530
This is horrible work

525
00:39:01.697 --> 00:39:04.074
and the worst unit
I have ever seen in my life!


526
00:39:04.992 --> 00:39:08.370
I'm not at all interested in your opinion
about what I should,


527
00:39:08.578 --> 00:39:09.705
or shouldn't do.

528
00:39:10.372 --> 00:39:12.666
If you can't understand this,

529
00:39:12.958 --> 00:39:15.794
then your place is not here,
but outside in the yard,


530
00:39:16.336 --> 00:39:18.255
with the pigs.

531
00:39:18.630 --> 00:39:21.174
-Clear enough?
-Yes, Commander!


532
00:39:21.341 --> 00:39:23.301
It won't happen again, Commander!

533
00:39:24.678 --> 00:39:25.637
Good.

534
00:39:27.514 --> 00:39:28.932
Then let us leave this subject,

535
00:39:29.099 --> 00:39:30.934
or our young soldier will pass out.

536
00:39:32.436 --> 00:39:33.395
Tell me,

537
00:39:34.980 --> 00:39:36.064
what's your name?

538
00:39:37.691 --> 00:39:39.443
-Gunther.
-Gunther.


539
00:39:44.406 --> 00:39:45.365
Take a seat.

540
00:39:54.499 --> 00:39:56.835
He is not well in his company.

541
00:39:57.627 --> 00:39:59.546
Yeah, that's true.

542
00:40:01.506 --> 00:40:04.968
Do you know how
they call our Commander?


543
00:40:07.387 --> 00:40:08.346
Braun?

544
00:40:10.307 --> 00:40:11.475
Hangman Braun.

545
00:40:12.642 --> 00:40:15.228
Do you know why they would give him...

546
00:40:15.562 --> 00:40:18.398
a nickname such as that, then?

547
00:40:18.940 --> 00:40:20.734
[Schmidt] I don't want to know it!

548
00:40:21.318 --> 00:40:23.236
Anyway, it's better to hunt for

549
00:40:23.403 --> 00:40:25.614
some imaginary ghost

550
00:40:25.947 --> 00:40:27.824
than to fight at the front.

551
00:40:28.075 --> 00:40:29.326
Yeah, definitely.

552
00:40:32.788 --> 00:40:35.540
He's had them by the balls all winter.

553
00:40:36.291 --> 00:40:39.419
If a German gets careless,
or strays away from his group,


554
00:40:39.586 --> 00:40:41.630
that's when the Red Ghost makes his move.

555
00:40:41.922 --> 00:40:43.006
He kills them,

556
00:40:43.924 --> 00:40:45.675
then disappears into thin air.

557
00:40:46.176 --> 00:40:49.096
They say, he's sent one hundred krauts
to meet their maker.


558
00:40:49.387 --> 00:40:51.848
And to make it clear who's done it,

559
00:40:52.474 --> 00:40:54.559
he tears off the officers" badges.

560
00:40:55.060 --> 00:40:56.770
He gets into their heads, you see?

561
00:40:57.646 --> 00:40:59.397
Gets right into their heads.

562
00:40:59.815 --> 00:41:02.025
-And fills them with terror.
-A hundred?


563
00:41:02.859 --> 00:41:03.819
Huh?

564
00:41:04.111 --> 00:41:05.112
A hundred of them?

565
00:41:05.320 --> 00:41:06.404
Well, maybe more.

566
00:41:09.699 --> 00:41:12.119
They burnt our village to the ground.

567
00:41:13.954 --> 00:41:17.958
Only me
and Konstantin managed to survive.


568
00:41:26.424 --> 00:41:28.593
[Pops sighs] We hid in the woods.

569
00:41:28.844 --> 00:41:31.555
It's personal for Kostya and me
with them krauts.


570
00:41:31.888 --> 00:41:33.557
And now because of my friend.

571
00:41:34.057 --> 00:41:35.308
I thought we'd...

572
00:41:35.851 --> 00:41:36.810
go to...

573
00:41:37.102 --> 00:41:38.687
the front with the guys.

574
00:41:38.979 --> 00:41:42.566
Join the Partisans
and then show them fascist murderers.


575
00:41:42.983 --> 00:41:44.317
But now, I guess,

576
00:41:44.651 --> 00:41:45.610
we'll have to...

577
00:41:45.986 --> 00:41:47.821
-do it here.
-One man kills them?


578
00:41:48.113 --> 00:41:49.072
A hundred?

579
00:41:50.532 --> 00:41:52.117
Maybe he's immortal.

580
00:41:52.576 --> 00:41:53.910
Maybe, yes.

581
00:41:55.245 --> 00:41:59.040
I've never met him,
but that's what people say.


582
00:42:04.504 --> 00:42:06.673
But how long can a loner survive?

583
00:42:09.176 --> 00:42:10.302
Well, Gunther,

584
00:42:10.594 --> 00:42:14.598
are you ready to try the best meal
on the Eastern front?


585
00:42:18.059 --> 00:42:19.561
-Tell me, Gunther.
-Yeah?


586
00:42:20.395 --> 00:42:22.397
Since you're such a wonder kid,

587
00:42:22.564 --> 00:42:24.065
How long is the...

588
00:42:24.441 --> 00:42:25.650
Great Wall of China?

589
00:42:26.943 --> 00:42:28.445
In a straight line,

590
00:42:29.070 --> 00:42:30.405
its length is...

591
00:42:30.739 --> 00:42:33.366
2450 kilometers.

592
00:42:33.575 --> 00:42:35.619
But with its branches it is...

593
00:42:36.912 --> 00:42:39.956
8851.

594
00:42:40.290 --> 00:42:41.291
[Koch laughs]

595
00:42:41.666 --> 00:42:42.667
[Koch laughs]

596
00:42:42.959 --> 00:42:43.960
Very good.

597
00:42:45.503 --> 00:42:47.047
And if we multiply...

598
00:42:47.797 --> 00:42:50.759
375

599
00:42:50.926 --> 00:42:52.469
and eight...

600
00:42:52.886 --> 00:42:54.596
hundred and 35?

601
00:42:57.557 --> 00:42:58.516
I have no idea.

-what do you have there?
-Where?


605
00:43:06.024 --> 00:43:07.317
Right there in your hands.

606
00:43:07.651 --> 00:43:08.610
Oh, this.

607
00:43:08.860 --> 00:43:10.403
I found it down in the cellar.

608
00:43:10.737 --> 00:43:12.489
That is so dangerous.

609
00:43:12.822 --> 00:43:13.865
The devil's drink!

610
00:43:14.407 --> 00:43:17.577
Aren't you aware that
taking moonshine is strictly forbidden?


611
00:43:18.286 --> 00:43:19.704
Not a single sip without me!

612
00:43:20.205 --> 00:43:22.457
-Understood?
-[soldiers laugh]


613
00:43:23.083 --> 00:43:24.626
[Klein] It was along this line...

614
00:43:24.793 --> 00:43:26.253
along sector seven.

615
00:43:26.503 --> 00:43:27.754
[Braun] What is this here?

616
00:43:28.088 --> 00:43:29.547
[Klein] This one? Sector six.

617
00:43:29.756 --> 00:43:31.174
[Braun] How far away is that?

618
00:43:32.342 --> 00:43:33.593
30 kilometers.

619
00:43:34.010 --> 00:43:37.138
There were no assaults
in that area of the big ghost.


620
00:43:37.347 --> 00:43:38.974
If one looks at the assaults,

621
00:43:39.140 --> 00:43:41.226
-there is exactly a triangle.
-Exactly.


622
00:43:41.393 --> 00:43:43.687
[Klein] But how can one get
from A to B...


623
00:43:46.189 --> 00:43:47.440
in one night?

- I don't know.
- I guess he's not alone.


625
00:43:51.611 --> 00:43:54.614
I think he's traveling in a group
with other people.


626
00:43:55.740 --> 00:43:57.158
I think possibly they are two, three

627
00:43:57.492 --> 00:43:58.618
or four snipers.

628
00:43:59.577 --> 00:44:00.537
But tactically...

629
00:44:00.829 --> 00:44:02.831
tactically those places have no meaning.

630
00:44:03.206 --> 00:44:04.332
I don"t know but...

Bravo, Gunther.

I was right about you.

You're a real German gallant.

But we can't keep this poor young lady
in the trunk.

It's unbecoming.

Come.

In what month are you?

How long do you have to go?

Water, please. 
I need to drink water.

Not so long to go.

And what was she doing in the trunk?

then I hid myself there in...

01:01:33.630 --> 01:01:34.715
Don't give me orders!

847
01:02:32.231 --> 01:02:35.025
[Pops] Oh my God, 
I can't move so fast.

848
01:02:47.329 --> 01:02:48.580
What do you see?

849
01:02:50.249 --> 01:02:51.208
He's gone.

850
01:03:06.473 --> 01:03:07.433
Kostya,

851
01:03:08.058 --> 01:03:09.017
the door.

852
01:03:19.611 --> 01:03:21.363
[Red Ghost gasping]

853
01:03:39.339 --> 01:03:40.299
My God,

854
01:03:41.383 --> 01:03:42.759
it's really him?

855
01:03:43.469 --> 01:03:45.095
-Who?
-The Ghost.


856
01:03:45.345 --> 01:03:46.305
Who do you think?

857
01:03:48.807 --> 01:03:50.058
Check how he is!

858
01:03:54.062 --> 01:03:55.355
-Breathing.
-Good.


859
01:03:55.689 --> 01:03:56.732
He doesn't...

860
01:03:57.065 --> 01:03:58.525
die so easily.

861
01:03:58.984 --> 01:04:01.195
Did you see how many Germans he killed?

862
01:04:02.070 --> 01:04:03.030
This man's...

863
01:04:03.864 --> 01:04:04.948
a proud warrior.

864
01:04:11.497 --> 01:04:12.956
It's for Kostya, this bread.

865
01:04:13.165 --> 01:04:15.375
Uh-huh. Go take it over to him.

866
01:04:18.128 --> 01:04:19.087
Commander,

867
01:04:19.546 --> 01:04:22.174
did you see
how I killed the machine gunner?


868
01:04:22.549 --> 01:04:23.967
My eyes, they're still sharp.

869
01:04:24.218 --> 01:04:26.136
And the Germans, they shat their pants!

870
01:04:27.054 --> 01:04:28.972
[Pops and Vera laughs]

871
01:04:29.264 --> 01:04:32.643
I knew something bad would happen
when you guys decided to leave.


872
01:04:32.809 --> 01:04:33.769
Me, too.

873
01:04:34.436 --> 01:04:35.395
[Vera laughs]

874
01:04:43.529 --> 01:04:45.405
Here you go, Kostya. Eat.

875
01:04:48.408 --> 01:04:49.368
Water!

876
01:04:59.962 --> 01:05:00.921
You bastard!

877
01:05:01.296 --> 01:05:02.714
Everyone's against me.

878
01:05:06.051 --> 01:05:07.094
[Klein sighs]

879
01:05:07.553 --> 01:05:09.304
I'm telling you, we're right here.

880
01:05:09.638 --> 01:05:11.098
And where is Taraskovo?

881
01:05:11.265 --> 01:05:13.308
-This here is Taraskovo.
-And the Germans?


882
01:05:13.475 --> 01:05:14.434
Just here.

883
01:05:14.977 --> 01:05:17.396
Then we go via Taraskovo.

884
01:05:17.563 --> 01:05:18.564
I know it well.

885
01:05:18.814 --> 01:05:20.566
I know every stone, 
I know it well.

886
01:05:20.774 --> 01:05:22.192
That's with maps or no maps.

887
01:05:22.401 --> 01:05:23.735
I know every pine tree.

888
01:05:23.902 --> 01:05:26.780
<i>-I don't need a map.
-Where'd your friend hide his booze?</i>


889
01:05:26.989 --> 01:05:28.824
Is that all you think of?

890
01:05:28.991 --> 01:05:31.868
I can't believe you'd ask about booze
at a time like this.


891
01:05:34.037 --> 01:05:36.164
There's so much food! Hot food,

892
01:05:36.331 --> 01:05:37.332
even a sauna.

893
01:05:37.583 --> 01:05:40.377
I guarantee you
there's booze here somewhere!


894
01:05:40.586 --> 01:05:41.545
I'm covered in lice!

895
01:05:41.837 --> 01:05:44.506
[Commissary] Sergeant, look at this.
A hole, here,


896
01:05:44.673 --> 01:05:45.757
in the German' front.

897
01:05:46.091 --> 01:05:47.175
With a little luck,

898
01:05:47.342 --> 01:05:48.969
we will find our people tomorrow.

899
01:05:49.344 --> 01:05:50.846
What do we do with that guy?

900
01:05:51.013 --> 01:05:52.723
We carry him around like a king?

901
01:05:52.889 --> 01:05:54.558
If necessary, we will.

902
01:05:54.766 --> 01:05:55.767
Now that's enough!

903
01:05:56.018 --> 01:05:57.603
Just get ready to go, will you?

904
01:05:58.145 --> 01:05:59.730
[Vera screams]

905
01:06:03.817 --> 01:06:04.943
Oh, it's coming.

906
01:06:06.153 --> 01:06:07.112
It's coming!

907
01:06:14.828 --> 01:06:16.204
What the hell are you doing?

908
01:06:16.413 --> 01:06:17.581
What are you doing?

909
01:06:18.081 --> 01:06:19.041
Arman?

910
01:06:19.791 --> 01:06:21.418
Two more over here! This minute!

911
01:06:22.044 --> 01:06:25.422
Listen to me, Arman.
We're losing precious time.


912
01:06:26.131 --> 01:06:28.091
It's taking way too long.

913
01:06:29.217 --> 01:06:30.177
What?

914
01:06:40.520 --> 01:06:42.356
Who the hell is that?

915
01:06:43.148 --> 01:06:45.025
[Braun panting]

916
01:07:16.181 --> 01:07:17.349
Wonderful.

917
01:07:24.189 --> 01:07:26.483
[Sailor] Kostya, open the door for me.

918
01:07:28.694 --> 01:07:30.779
I can't believe our group is growing.

919
01:07:31.571 --> 01:07:32.572
A new member!

920
01:07:33.365 --> 01:07:34.616
What a surprise!

921
01:07:42.541 --> 01:07:44.251
-[Vera screaming]
-[Pops] Come on!


922
01:07:44.501 --> 01:07:46.294
I just need to grab your legs!

923
01:07:46.878 --> 01:07:48.338
Push! Push! Push! Push!

924
01:07:48.547 --> 01:07:49.923
That's right. Yep. Yep.

925
01:07:50.090 --> 01:07:51.049
Right, right!

926
01:07:51.216 --> 01:07:53.343
With God's help,
you can do this. Come on,


927
01:07:53.510 --> 01:07:55.721
you just need to breathe.
Breathe, breathe.


928
01:07:55.971 --> 01:07:57.097
Like this.

929
01:07:57.431 --> 01:07:58.390
Like that.

930
01:07:58.598 --> 01:07:59.850
What are they doing here?

931
01:08:00.475 --> 01:08:01.977
Out with you! Go on! Get out!

932
01:08:02.144 --> 01:08:03.145
-Right now!
-Stay!


933
01:08:03.311 --> 01:08:04.312
Is this your first?

934
01:08:05.105 --> 01:08:06.815
I've delivered three babies before.

935
01:08:07.107 --> 01:08:08.608
Here comes number four.

936
01:08:08.984 --> 01:08:11.987
Hold her tight! Push! Push!
Push! That's it, good.


937
01:08:13.029 --> 01:08:15.323
-[Vera screams]
-[Pops] Come on, girl! Yeah!


938
01:08:15.615 --> 01:08:17.576
That's it! Come on, girl.
You can do it.


939
01:08:17.743 --> 01:08:19.828
With God's help,
you'll soon give birth.


940

<i>-No, I can't!
-You can!</i>


941
01:08:21.872 --> 01:08:24.040
Of course you can! 
Back in the past,

942
01:08:24.249 --> 01:08:26.001
women gave birth in haystacks.

943
01:08:26.209 --> 01:08:28.295
-They didn't make a fuss about it!
-No!


944
01:08:28.462 --> 01:08:31.089
-Hold her! You're almost there!
-I don't want to!


945
01:08:31.715 --> 01:08:33.133
Why so quiet?

946
01:08:33.800 --> 01:08:35.469
You have an anecdote or something?

947
01:08:36.052 --> 01:08:37.012
About what?

948
01:08:37.888 --> 01:08:40.348
-The one about sparrows.
-Oh.


949
01:08:42.809 --> 01:08:45.103
So, a Russian asks
for a bottle of vodka.

950
01:08:45.645 --> 01:08:47.773
He drank a bottle, and then got another.

951
01:08:48.106 --> 01:08:49.441
And then he drank that one.

952
01:08:49.691 --> 01:08:52.569
And then he gets a third bottle.
And by now he's getting...


953
01:08:52.903 --> 01:08:54.654
just really, really drunk.

954
01:08:55.447 --> 01:08:57.073
-I can't!
-Come on, come on!


955
01:08:57.240 --> 01:08:58.784
Now, breathe like that. Go on!

956
01:08:58.950 --> 01:08:59.910
Go on!

957
01:09:00.410 --> 01:09:02.120
Do it like I showed you. That's it.

958
01:09:02.287 --> 01:09:03.789
Well, he takes the gun, and...

959
01:09:04.080 --> 01:09:06.249
shoots the sparrow
into a thousand pieces.


960
01:09:07.042 --> 01:09:08.919
The Germans ask, "How are you able...

961
01:09:09.127 --> 01:09:10.086
to hit it?"

962
01:09:10.462 --> 01:09:11.713
And the Russian replied:

963
01:09:12.130 --> 01:09:15.675
"It's really not a problem
when you've had four bottles,


964
01:09:16.092 --> 01:09:17.803
then there are sparrows everywhere!

965
01:09:18.720 --> 01:09:20.096
[Vera grunting]

966
01:09:20.472 --> 01:09:21.765
[Pops] Yes! Push!

967
01:09:22.182 --> 01:09:23.183
That's funny.

968
01:09:23.433 --> 01:09:24.935
Tell me it's going to be okay!

969
01:09:25.143 --> 01:09:28.021
-Please tell me it'll be okay!
-Just imagine it's all over.


970
01:09:28.188 --> 01:09:29.481
It will be over very soon.

971
01:09:29.648 --> 01:09:32.150
It's like,
it's like when you need to take a shit.


972
01:09:32.609 --> 01:09:34.528
-But you can'!
-Breathe! And breathe.


973
01:09:34.694 --> 01:09:36.947
That's it! That's it!
That's it! That's it!


974
01:09:37.989 --> 01:09:38.949
Here.

975
01:09:39.199 --> 01:09:40.826
-[Vera screaming]
-[Pops] Push!


976
01:09:41.117 --> 01:09:42.077
What is it?

977
01:09:42.494 --> 01:09:43.787
The Ghost had it on him.

978
01:09:44.079 --> 01:09:45.580
It's him as a child. I think.

979
01:09:46.540 --> 01:09:48.416
He looked very different as a child.

980
01:09:49.417 --> 01:09:50.418
As did I.

981
01:09:50.794 --> 01:09:52.379
-Return it.
-I'll give it back.


982
01:09:52.546 --> 01:09:54.130
-Push! And push!
-[Vera screams]


983
01:09:54.297 --> 01:09:55.257
Yeah, well done!

984
01:09:55.549 --> 01:09:57.717
[Pops laughs] Well, look at that!

985
01:09:57.968 --> 01:09:58.927
Hold on.

986
01:10:00.136 --> 01:10:01.930
There he is. There he is.

987
01:10:04.057 --> 01:10:05.141
It's all done.

988
01:10:05.392 --> 01:10:06.726
-That's it now.
-My baby.


989
01:10:06.893 --> 01:10:08.353
That's it. It's done.

990

991
01:10:10.146 --> 01:10:11.106
Yeah.

Blabber-mouth!

Come here now! Come here!

994
01:10:15.110 --> 01:10:16.611
Now, get me a knife.

995
01:10:19.030 --> 01:10:21.157
No, hold it over the fire.

996
01:10:24.035 --> 01:10:24.995
My child.

997
01:10:25.203 --> 01:10:26.162
Yes.

998
01:10:26.913 --> 01:10:29.457
God guide my hand.
God be with me.


999
01:10:29.833 --> 01:10:30.792
Right then.

1000
01:10:31.334 --> 01:10:32.294
All done!

1001
01:10:32.794 --> 01:10:33.753
That's it.

1002
01:10:34.588 --> 01:10:36.965
-It's a boy? If's a boy?
-Finished. Yes.

-It's a boy?
-Yes. Yes it is.

[Pops laughs]

1005
01:10:40.844 --> 01:10:41.803
And you said...

1006
01:10:42.345 --> 01:10:43.471
you couldn't do it.

1007
01:10:43.847 --> 01:10:44.931
Well, you did.

1008
01:10:45.140 --> 01:10:46.558
[Pops laughs]

1009
