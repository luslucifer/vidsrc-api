1
00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:21.022
I still get the same reaction
when I see a B-17.


2
00:00:21.898 --> 00:00:24.484
But isn't that a beautiful aircraft?

3
00:00:25.193 --> 00:00:26.820
It's like a piece of sculpture.

4
00:00:28.238 --> 00:00:31.616
And it's lovely in the air
when your wheels are up.


5
00:00:37.122 --> 00:00:39.082
When you flew in formation...

6
00:00:42.961 --> 00:00:45.547
sometimes with a thousand aircraft...

7
00:00:47.966 --> 00:00:50.427
it was a very beautiful
and dramatic sight.


8
00:00:52.679 --> 00:00:55.056
<i>In the cold, blue skies over Europe,</i>

9
00:00:55.599 --> 00:00:57.267
<i>a new kind of combat was fought</i>

10
00:00:57.267 --> 00:01:01.271
<i>in an environment
that had never been experienced before.</i>


11
00:01:01.897 --> 00:01:04.940
<i>It was a singular event
in the history of warfare.</i>


12
00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:08.737
<i>Unprecedented and never to be repeated.</i>

13
00:01:19.289 --> 00:01:21.791
<i>Airmen from 40 American bomber groups</i>

14
00:01:21.791 --> 00:01:25.587
<i>bled and died in staggering numbers
in air combat.</i>


15
00:01:26.087 --> 00:01:29.507
<i>One of these groups,
hyperaggressive and undisciplined,</i>


16
00:01:29.507 --> 00:01:33.720
<i>suffered so many casualties
in such a short period of time</i>


17
00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.514
<i>it became known as the Bloody Hundredth.</i>

18
00:01:55.825 --> 00:01:58.036
<i>Germany has invaded Poland.</i>

19
00:01:58.036 --> 00:02:02.165
<i>In a big attack, about nine o'clock,
Warsaw itself was bombed.</i>


20
00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:10.173
<i>The German army invaded
Holland and Belgium early this morning</i>


21
00:02:10.173 --> 00:02:12.884
<i>by land and from parachutes</i>

22
00:02:16.805 --> 00:02:18.848
<i>You ask, what is our policy?</i>

23
00:02:18.848 --> 00:02:22.185
<i>It is to wage war
by sea, land and air.</i>

24
00:02:22.185 --> 00:02:26.856
<i>To wage war against
a monstrous tyranny never surpassed</i>


25
00:02:26.856 --> 00:02:30.986
<i>in the dark
and lamentable catalog of human crime.</i>


26
00:02:34.698 --> 00:02:36.700
<i>If Great Britain goes down,</i>

27
00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:42.747
<i>the Axis powers will control
the continents of Europe and Asia</i>


28
00:02:42.747 --> 00:02:46.418
and Africa, and they
will be in a position

29
00:02:46.418 --> 00:02:52.507
to bring enormous military and naval
resources against this hemisphere.


30
00:02:53.675 --> 00:02:55.552
<i>We have witnessed this morning</i>

31
00:02:55.552 --> 00:02:59.639
<i>severe bombing of Pearl Harbor
by enemy planes.</i>


32
00:03:00.181 --> 00:03:01.558
<i>It is no joke.</i>

33
00:03:01.558 --> 00:03:03.351
<i>It is a real war.</i>

34
00:03:05.145 --> 00:03:08.315
<i>I ask that the Congress declare</i>

35
00:03:08.315 --> 00:03:11.234
<i>that since the unprovoked</i>

36
00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:15.989
<i>and dastardly attack by Japan,</i>

37
00:03:16.656 --> 00:03:18.700
a state of war.

38
00:03:32.589 --> 00:03:34.007
<i>At this point in the war,</i>

39
00:03:34.007 --> 00:03:36.968
<i>Hitler's Germany
controlled continental Europe.</i>


40
00:03:36.968 --> 00:03:39.721
<i>Great Britain stood alone and vulnerable,</i>

41
00:03:39.721 --> 00:03:44.267
<i>the last surviving European democracy
at war with the Nazis.</i>


42
00:03:44.809 --> 00:03:47.979
<i>And the question became
how to hit back at the enemy.</i>


43
00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:52.234
<i>Britain's bomber command
had been striking Germany incessantly</i>


44
00:03:52.234 --> 00:03:54.986
<i>but ineffectively since 1940,</i>

45
00:03:54.986 --> 00:03:59.950
<i>taking huge losses in night raids
that often missed their targets by miles.</i>


46
00:04:01.952 --> 00:04:05.413
There was a clear
and present danger to global democracy


47
00:04:05.413 --> 00:04:07.707
because of the Nazis.

48
00:04:07.707 --> 00:04:11.503
So, patriotism was something
that the Greatest Generation,


49
00:04:11.503 --> 00:04:14.047
my father's generation,
took very, very seriously.


50
00:04:16.591 --> 00:04:19.134
Now, it isn't as if it was
a chore for me to talk to you


51
00:04:19.134 --> 00:04:22.973
because I wanna speak on my
favorite subject, the Army Air Forces.


52
00:04:24.015 --> 00:04:26.393
I can't speak from long experience.

53
00:04:27.185 --> 00:04:28.687
I've only been in the service a year,

54
00:04:28.687 --> 00:04:31.982
but I've learned a lot about
what the air forces have to offer.


55
00:04:33.149 --> 00:04:34.526
That's what I wanna talk to you about.

56
00:04:35.735 --> 00:04:39.406
<i>The Army Air Forces need 15,000 captains,</i>

57
00:04:39.406 --> 00:04:43.827
<i>40,000 lieutenants,

58
00:04:44.369 --> 00:04:47.080
Young men of America,
your future's in the sky.


59
00:04:47.664 --> 00:04:49.291
<i>Your wings are waiting.</i>

60
00:04:51.293 --> 00:04:54.629
I was in the middle
of my sophomore year in college


61
00:04:54.629 --> 00:05:00.594
and didn't have a lot on my mind but
chasing girls and drinking whiskey.


62
00:05:01.219 --> 00:05:04.180
Meantime, Pearl Harbor happens, and then,

63
00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:09.728
along with my other fraternity brothers,
were recruited as aviation cadets.


64
00:05:09.728 --> 00:05:11.354
Attention!

65
00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:15.650
At that time,
there was a great deal of anti-Semitism.


66
00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:20.113
And Hitler, with his talk of superiority
of the Aryan nation,


67
00:05:20.113 --> 00:05:24.701
I had a sense of frustration
that I couldn't do anything about it.


68
00:05:24.701 --> 00:05:27.537
Suddenly, that frustration disappeared.

69
00:05:27.537 --> 00:05:29.706
I'd felt now that I could do something.

70
00:05:30.206 --> 00:05:33.919
I thought the most effective
way to serve would be as a pilot.


71
00:05:35.295 --> 00:05:40.133
I went down the next day
and volunteered to be an air force cadet.


72
00:05:43.261 --> 00:05:46.890
<i>Before enlisting, thousands
of American flyers had never set foot</i>


73
00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:51.728
<i>in an airplane or fired a shot at
anything more threatening than a squirrel.</i>


74
00:05:51.728 --> 00:05:54.814
<i>The crews were made up of men
from every part of America</i>


75
00:05:54.814 --> 00:05:57.317
<i>and nearly every station in life.</i>

76
00:05:57.317 --> 00:06:01.655
<i>There were Harvard history majors
and West Virginia coal miners.</i>


77
00:06:01.655 --> 00:06:04.783
<i>Wall Street lawyers
and Oklahoma cowpunchers.</i>


78
00:06:05.408 --> 00:06:08.703
<i>Hollywood idols and football heroes.</i>

79
00:06:11.373 --> 00:06:13.250
<i>The cadets have passed their test.</i>

80
00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:15.293
<i>And now, they'll get their flying lessons.</i>

81
00:06:16.086 --> 00:06:19.464
Each instructor had four students.

82
00:06:19.464 --> 00:06:23.385
The other three students
had previous flight training, I had none.


83
00:06:23.385 --> 00:06:25.554
I had never been inside of an airplane.

84
00:06:30.058 --> 00:06:32.978
After about ten hours, we'd have solo.

85
00:06:33.478 --> 00:06:36.648
When those wheels leave the ground,
there's no one to help you.


86
00:06:36.648 --> 00:06:37.691
You're on your own.

87
00:06:40.068 --> 00:06:45.323
I became a navigator
because I was a flop as a pilot.


88
00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:47.784
I got washed out.

89
00:06:47.784 --> 00:06:51.037
I'll never forget the guy that
washed me out was Lieutenant Maytag,


90
00:06:51.037 --> 00:06:54.541
proper name for washing out
a prospective flying student.


91
00:06:55.125 --> 00:06:59.713
I had a military instructor,
and he was about to wash me out,


92
00:07:00.422 --> 00:07:02.465
and he said,
"You're gonna kill yourself anyway,


93
00:07:02.465 --> 00:07:06.136
but I'll tell you what,
I'm gonna go over and sit under that tree.


94
00:07:06.136 --> 00:07:11.558
If you can take this up three times and
around the pattern and land it, you're in.


95
00:07:12.100 --> 00:07:14.102
If not, you're out."

96
00:07:16.730 --> 00:07:20.775
We flew from eight o'clock
in the morning to eight o'clock at night.


97
00:07:20.775 --> 00:07:24.821
I did various maneuvers
of chandelles and lazy S's.


98
00:07:24.821 --> 00:07:27.657
And on a rare
day off, we would dogfight.

99
00:07:29.659 --> 00:07:32.621
I never enjoyed anything
more than I did at that time.


100
00:07:43.548 --> 00:07:48.470
Forty of my classmates,
just graduated from flying school,


101
00:07:48.470 --> 00:07:49.763
along with me,

102
00:07:49.763 --> 00:07:53.099
were all assigned to fly the B-17.

103
00:07:53.099 --> 00:07:55.936
We'd never been in a B-17 before.

104
00:07:58.188 --> 00:08:01.441
<i>The Boeing Flying Fortress,
manned by ten men,</i>


105
00:08:01.441 --> 00:08:04.444
<i>this new bomber has a speed
of nearly 300 miles an hour.</i>


106
00:08:04.444 --> 00:08:07.155
<i>The bulges on its fuselage
are turrets for machine guns.</i>


107
00:08:07.948 --> 00:08:09.616
<i>With 4,000 horsepower engines,</i>

108
00:08:09.616 --> 00:08:13.495
<i>it can cruise for 3,000 miles
without landing to refuel.</i>


109
00:08:13.495 --> 00:08:18.792
B-17 was the first both offensive
and defensive aircraft ever designed.


110
00:08:19.501 --> 00:08:23.797
Offensively, it dropped
very heavy payloads for its day.


111
00:08:23.797 --> 00:08:27.342
And it was called the Flying Fortress
because it had so many 50-caliber guns.


112
00:08:28.927 --> 00:08:31.888
The feel of the B-17 was wonderful.

113
00:08:32.389 --> 00:08:37.811
The plane responded so beautifully
that I immediately related to it.


114
00:08:38.852 --> 00:08:41.356
I was very happy to be on B-17s.

115
00:08:42.941 --> 00:08:45.902
We had about
five or six months of practice training


116
00:08:45.902 --> 00:08:48.196
and getting ready
for an overseas assignment.


117
00:08:50.156 --> 00:08:54.160
In May of 1943
we were sent to England

118
00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:56.037
to become a part
of the Eighth Air Force.


119
00:08:57.998 --> 00:09:01.126
We were told before we went overseas,

120
00:09:01.918 --> 00:09:04.546
"You look on your left and your right,

121
00:09:04.546 --> 00:09:06.715
and only one of
you is gonna come back."

122
00:09:07.299 --> 00:09:09.551
We were going overseas to die.

123
00:09:25.400 --> 00:09:28.820
<i>Just as the crews of the 100th
began arriving at their new base</i>


124
00:09:28.820 --> 00:09:33.909
<i>in rural eastern England,
the European war entered a new phase.</i>


125
00:09:33.909 --> 00:09:36.578
<i>It was the official beginning
of Pointblank,</i>


126
00:09:36.578 --> 00:09:39.039
<i>an around-the-clock bombing campaign,</i>

127
00:09:39.039 --> 00:09:42.208
<i>with the Americans bombing by day
and the British by night.</i>


128
00:09:42.709 --> 00:09:47.047
<i>Its purpose, to achieve air supremacy
over northern Europe</i>


129
00:09:47.047 --> 00:09:49.633
<i>by the D-Day invasion
the following spring.</i>


130
00:09:50.634 --> 00:09:54.679
<i>Without air supremacy, the Allies
could not invade the European continent.</i>


131
00:09:58.266 --> 00:10:01.937
We'd just got there
and getting to know one another,


132
00:10:01.937 --> 00:10:06.399
and King, the pilot, asked me,
"What had you done before?"


133
00:10:06.399 --> 00:10:11.321
I said, "Well,
recently I did the work of a cowboy."


134
00:10:11.321 --> 00:10:15.075
And he said, "Well, fine,
you'll be Cowboy from now on."


135
00:10:15.992 --> 00:10:17.869
The 100th is a young outfit,

136
00:10:17.869 --> 00:10:20.956
and it had some
pretty reckless young commanders.


137
00:10:20.956 --> 00:10:24.251
A guy named Gale Cleven,
who was a squadron commander


138
00:10:24.251 --> 00:10:26.920
and an air executive named John Egan.

139
00:10:26.920 --> 00:10:30.757
Egan and Cleven didn't have to fly
as squadron leaders, but always did.


140
00:10:30.757 --> 00:10:33.343
And that's one of the reasons
the men admired them.


141
00:10:33.343 --> 00:10:38.223
Buck Cleven,
along with Bucky Egan, they wore scarves


142
00:10:38.223 --> 00:10:41.560
and their hats cocked
on one side of their heads,


143
00:10:41.560 --> 00:10:43.562
and they were pretty cocky.

144
00:10:43.562 --> 00:10:46.606
They'd be at the officers' club,
and they would say,


145
00:10:46.606 --> 00:10:49.693
"Lieutenant, taxi over here,
I wanna talk to you."


146
00:10:50.485 --> 00:10:52.404
John Egan, Gale Cleven,

147
00:10:52.404 --> 00:10:55.365
their life's ambition
was to fly an airplane.


148
00:10:55.365 --> 00:10:56.866
And here they are, flying an airplane.

149
00:10:56.866 --> 00:11:00.036
Doing something that they love
for a country that they love


150
00:11:00.036 --> 00:11:01.538
on a mission that they believe in.

151
00:11:02.581 --> 00:11:05.083
<i>Cleven and Egan
would help lead the 100th</i>


152
00:11:05.083 --> 00:11:09.629
<i>against the most formidable air force
in the world, the German Luftwaffe,</i>


153
00:11:09.629 --> 00:11:14.342
<i>whose veteran pilots had seen action
over Spain, Norway, Poland,</i>


154
00:11:14.342 --> 00:11:19.723
<i>France, Russia, Greece,
North Africa and England.</i>


155
00:11:20.223 --> 00:11:25.145
They will understand the enormity
of their miscalculation


156
00:11:25.979 --> 00:11:30.692
that the Nazis would always have
the advantage of superior air power.


157
00:11:31.234 --> 00:11:35.405
That superiority has gone forever.

158
00:11:35.989 --> 00:11:41.369
We believe that the Nazis
and the fascists have asked for it,


159
00:11:41.369 --> 00:11:43.371
and they're going to get it.

160
00:11:52.422 --> 00:11:55.050
Captain Kirk, Captain Thompson,
Lieutenant Bushka,


161
00:11:55.050 --> 00:11:57.469
Iverson, Holloway and Hawkers
scheduled to fly.


162
00:11:57.469 --> 00:11:58.386
Snap it up.

163
00:12:02.057 --> 00:12:04.434
The commanding officer,
he'd come in, he'd come up the front,


164
00:12:05.268 --> 00:12:07.562
he'd pull back a curtain,

165
00:12:07.562 --> 00:12:12.609
and there'd be a red ribbon from
Thorpe Abbotts all the way to the target.


166
00:12:13.860 --> 00:12:16.696
This group of buildings here
is your target.


167
00:12:17.447 --> 00:12:20.033
This building will be the aiming point.

168
00:12:20.575 --> 00:12:24.204
If your bomb pattern
is concentrated in this area,


169
00:12:24.204 --> 00:12:27.582
it should very effectively
knock out the factory.


170
00:12:35.257 --> 00:12:39.010
After getting off the jeep
and getting some of the stuff stowed,


171
00:12:39.010 --> 00:12:42.347
then climbed aboard, got settled in,
and fired up.


172
00:12:55.652 --> 00:12:57.696
<i>Flying in a self-defending formation</i>

173
00:12:57.696 --> 00:13:00.365
<i>they called a combat box,</i>

174
00:13:00.365 --> 00:13:04.869
<i>with accumulative firepower
of as many as 13 guns on each plane,</i>


175
00:13:04.869 --> 00:13:09.249
<i>they could muscle their way to
the target through waves of enemy planes.</i>


176
00:13:10.625 --> 00:13:13.295
<i>At the fighter fields,
Thunderbolts are ready.</i>


177
00:13:18.425 --> 00:13:20.635
<i>They set out to meet the bombers.</i>

178
00:13:20.635 --> 00:13:24.014
<i>The two groups make
rendezvous over the English Channel,</i>


179
00:13:24.014 --> 00:13:27.517
<i>and with the fighters patrolling
the skies around the bomber formation,</i>


180
00:13:27.517 --> 00:13:30.353
<i>the air armada moves into enemy territory.</i>

181
00:13:32.272 --> 00:13:35.650
<i>The bombers received
limited protection from the smaller,</i>


182
00:13:35.650 --> 00:13:39.571
<i>more nimble fighter planes,
like the P-47 Thunderbolt,</i>


183
00:13:39.571 --> 00:13:43.033
<i>whose limited fuel capacity
forced it to leave the bombers</i>


184
00:13:43.033 --> 00:13:45.535
<i>once they crossed deep into Germany.</i>

185
00:13:45.535 --> 00:13:47.495
The crewmen were in an alien world

186
00:13:47.495 --> 00:13:52.459
to where they physically could not survive
without specialized clothing,


187
00:13:52.459 --> 00:13:54.252
without specialized equipment,

188
00:13:54.252 --> 00:13:57.297
without breathing oxygen
that was being pumped to them.


189
00:13:57.297 --> 00:14:00.634
As soon as we got to altitude,
we had to go on oxygen,


190
00:14:00.634 --> 00:14:03.178
so we had an oxygen mask
clasped on our face.


191
00:14:03.178 --> 00:14:05.055
And the stark cold.

192
00:14:05.055 --> 00:14:07.474
The frigid temperatures.

193
00:14:07.474 --> 00:14:11.353
We were operating
in 50 or 60 degrees below zero.


194
00:14:17.984 --> 00:14:21.196
The fighter escort did not have the range

195
00:14:21.196 --> 00:14:25.325
to escort the B-17s all the way
to the targets inside of Germany,


196
00:14:25.325 --> 00:14:27.577
so the Allied fighters turned around
and went back to England.


197
00:14:35.377 --> 00:14:39.172
I remember that when
we first crossed over the English Channel,


198
00:14:39.172 --> 00:14:43.426
I remember looking down and realizing
that we were over enemy territory,


199
00:14:43.426 --> 00:14:45.470
and I had a lump in my throat.

200
00:14:45.470 --> 00:14:46.888
I was nervous.

201
00:14:49.724 --> 00:14:51.726
<i>There are the black smudges of the flak</i>

202
00:14:51.726 --> 00:14:54.020
<i>that come up from
the antiaircraft guns below.</i>


203
00:14:54.813 --> 00:14:56.982
A flak gun is a German 88 gun,

204
00:14:56.982 --> 00:15:00.110
and it could fire a shell
up to 40,000 feet.


205
00:15:00.110 --> 00:15:05.240
The shell would explode in the air,
and it would throw shards of shrapnel.


206
00:15:07.617 --> 00:15:10.704
The skin of the plane is not steel,
it's aluminum.


207
00:15:10.704 --> 00:15:13.164
So, that meant
flak just blew holes in the plane.


208
00:15:15.292 --> 00:15:20.380
That was my first time to be
exposed to very heavy antiaircraft fire,


209
00:15:20.380 --> 00:15:23.341
and it was frightening.

210
00:15:28.096 --> 00:15:31.725
We were being confronted
by very experienced


211
00:15:31.725 --> 00:15:36.104
and very well equipped
and very well trained opposition.


212
00:15:36.104 --> 00:15:39.900
They were pros, and we were rank amateurs.

213
00:15:43.945 --> 00:15:46.531
<i>When the formation neared its target,</i>

214
00:15:46.531 --> 00:15:50.243
<i>the bombardiers entered variables
such as airspeed and wind drift</i>


215
00:15:50.243 --> 00:15:51.953
<i>into their Norden bombsights,</i>

216
00:15:51.953 --> 00:15:55.498
<i>top-secret aiming devices
designed to guide the planes</i>


217
00:15:55.498 --> 00:15:59.044
<i>to the optimal release point
for dropping their payloads.</i>


218
00:15:59.628 --> 00:16:02.589
The Norden bombsight,
it's supposed to be so accurate


219
00:16:02.589 --> 00:16:07.844
that you can bomb from 20,000 feet
and drop your bombs into a pickle barrel.


220
00:16:10.639 --> 00:16:12.098
When we dropped our bombs,

221
00:16:12.098 --> 00:16:14.684
I could see bombs from the planes
ahead of us dropping


222
00:16:14.684 --> 00:16:17.687
but also I could lean out
in the plexiglass nose


223
00:16:17.687 --> 00:16:21.274
and see the bombs
falling directly down from us.


224
00:16:21.274 --> 00:16:25.612
And then, when they exploded,
we could actually see the explosions.


225
00:16:25.612 --> 00:16:27.280
<i>The first bombers have been over,</i>

226
00:16:27.280 --> 00:16:30.617
<i>and the target's already partially
obscured by the fires they've started.</i>


227
00:16:31.409 --> 00:16:34.955
<i>Hits were scored on a power plant,
submarines under construction,</i>


228
00:16:34.955 --> 00:16:36.998
<i>and at least one U-boat in the water.</i>

229
00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:40.418
We dropped our bombs,

230
00:16:40.418 --> 00:16:43.088
a couple of fighter attacks,
nobody got hurt.


231
00:16:43.672 --> 00:16:45.757
And I thought, "Well, this isn't so bad."

232
00:16:48.552 --> 00:16:52.264
<i>The early missions for the 100th
were mostly coastal targets,</i>


233
00:16:52.264 --> 00:16:56.601
<i>like submarine pens
and industrial sites in France and Norway.</i>


234
00:16:57.561 --> 00:16:59.813
The air force was trying to destroy

235
00:16:59.813 --> 00:17:02.190
the war machine of Nazi Germany.

236
00:17:02.190 --> 00:17:05.485
The factories that made planes,
that made tanks.


237
00:17:05.485 --> 00:17:07.237
The factories that produced ball bearings.

238
00:17:07.821 --> 00:17:09.531
<i>At the British landing fields,</i>

239
00:17:09.531 --> 00:17:11.157
<i>word on the sky battle was out.</i>

240
00:17:12.242 --> 00:17:14.869
<i>Many of the fortresses themselves
were crippled.</i>


241
00:17:14.869 --> 00:17:19.207
<i>A few came in with feathered props
or with knocked-out landing gear.</i>


242
00:17:20.292 --> 00:17:23.253
The B-17 had the reputation
of being trustworthy and safe


243
00:17:23.253 --> 00:17:24.545
and getting people back.

244
00:17:24.545 --> 00:17:26.673
You could lose three engines and get home.

245
00:17:26.673 --> 00:17:30.093
You could lose half
of your vertical stabilizer on the tail


246
00:17:30.093 --> 00:17:31.219
and get home.

247
00:17:31.219 --> 00:17:34.097
It would bring you home on two engines,

248
00:17:34.097 --> 00:17:36.600
and I've seen 'em
come in with only one.

249
00:17:42.772 --> 00:17:44.983
<i>Everything was
about to change for the Eighth</i>


250
00:17:44.983 --> 00:17:47.611
<i>with the largest raid
they would undertake up to now.</i>


251
00:17:47.611 --> 00:17:51.406
<i>A double strike against
ball bearing plants in Schweinfurt</i>


252
00:17:51.406 --> 00:17:54.284
<i>and Messerschmitt factories in Regensburg,</i>

253
00:17:54.284 --> 00:17:58.246
<i>massively defended targets
deep inside Germany.</i>


254
00:17:58.246 --> 00:18:01.541
<i>The 100th was assigned
to the Regensburg Force.</i>


255
00:18:02.208 --> 00:18:05.003
When they pulled the curtain
away from the map,


256
00:18:05.003 --> 00:18:08.006
and you saw that red line
going all across Germany,


257
00:18:08.006 --> 00:18:10.091
you know, we thought, "Holy cow."

258
00:18:10.759 --> 00:18:13.470
The plan as designed
is really brilliant when you look at it.


259
00:18:13.470 --> 00:18:14.387
So, you've got

260
00:18:14.387 --> 00:18:19.100
Curtis LeMay's Third
Bombardment Division is going to fly


261
00:18:19.100 --> 00:18:23.313
and attack the Messerschmitt factories
at Regensburg and then head for Africa.


262
00:18:23.313 --> 00:18:27.275
And ten minutes behind them is gonna be
the First Bombardment Division,


263
00:18:27.275 --> 00:18:30.111
and they're gonna attack
the ball bearing plants at Schweinfurt


264
00:18:30.111 --> 00:18:31.696
and then go back to England.

265
00:18:31.696 --> 00:18:35.075
So, the Germans are gonna have to
decide which of these groups to hit.


266
00:18:35.075 --> 00:18:39.746
The problem is-- surprise, it's August,
and there's fog in Great Britain.


267
00:18:41.248 --> 00:18:42.666
<i>We went out that morning.</i>

268
00:18:42.666 --> 00:18:47.212
<i>I had took lanterns and flashlights
and lead the airplanes out.</i>


269
00:18:48.129 --> 00:18:51.466
<i>I got assembled about ten minutes late,
but we got off.</i>


270
00:18:51.466 --> 00:18:54.469
Curtis LeMay has trained
his bombardment division


271
00:18:54.469 --> 00:18:56.555
to take off in English fog.

272
00:18:56.555 --> 00:18:59.057
The other bombardment division hadn't.

273
00:18:59.057 --> 00:19:02.686
So, all of a sudden, LeMay gets
his guys up and gets them all formed,


274
00:19:02.686 --> 00:19:05.063
and the other bombardment division
hasn't even taken off yet.


275
00:19:05.814 --> 00:19:08.817
So, it ends up, instead of
a ten-minute gap, a two-hour gap.


276
00:19:11.278 --> 00:19:14.155
<i>This captured German film
shows how quickly their 109s</i>


277
00:19:14.155 --> 00:19:17.200
<i>and Focke-Wulf 190s
got into action after a warning.</i>


278
00:19:17.701 --> 00:19:21.079
<i>They had plenty of time to amass
their fighters at a chosen point of attack</i>


279
00:19:21.079 --> 00:19:24.833
<i>and to outnumber our escort
at anything from 2-to-1 to 10-to-1.</i>


280
00:19:28.003 --> 00:19:31.006
Flew across the channel.
It was a beautiful day out there.


281
00:19:31.798 --> 00:19:32.883
They hit the Dutch coast,

282
00:19:32.883 --> 00:19:35.176
and all of a sudden
the whole world exploded.


283
00:19:36.219 --> 00:19:38.179
Kept up for the next two hours.

284
00:19:41.057 --> 00:19:44.227
The training we'd had previously
gave us the idea


285
00:19:44.227 --> 00:19:46.771
that we could outrun German fighters.

286
00:19:46.771 --> 00:19:50.150
Of course,
we learned that that was not true.


287
00:19:51.026 --> 00:19:55.196
There was flak, there were
fighters, more flak, more fighters.


288
00:19:55.196 --> 00:19:59.910
And I could hear the top turret
chattering away with machine-gun fire.


289
00:20:00.577 --> 00:20:04.289
Cleven's plane took six hits.

290
00:20:04.289 --> 00:20:07.292
They knocked out the hydraulic system.
They knocked out one of the engines.


291
00:20:07.876 --> 00:20:09.544
The cockpit is on fire.

292
00:20:09.544 --> 00:20:13.632
Cleven turns around,
and he looks at the radio gunner,


293
00:20:13.632 --> 00:20:15.926
and the radio gunner
doesn't have any legs.


294
00:20:15.926 --> 00:20:17.093
They'd been sheared off.

295
00:20:19.930 --> 00:20:22.057
And I still remember one plane,

296
00:20:22.057 --> 00:20:24.851
fire was coming out
of every opening in that hull.


297
00:20:26.853 --> 00:20:29.564
I dreamed about that
one for a long time.

298
00:20:30.607 --> 00:20:32.442
Every single member of that flight crew

299
00:20:32.442 --> 00:20:35.654
was fighting so democracy
and freedom could reign.


300
00:20:35.654 --> 00:20:39.241
But when you're in combat,
you know who you're fighting for?


301
00:20:39.241 --> 00:20:42.035
The guy to your left
and the guy to your right.


302
00:20:42.035 --> 00:20:44.371
The guy just ahead of you
and the guy just behind you.


303
00:20:44.371 --> 00:20:45.789
That's the pod you're fighting for.

304
00:20:48.750 --> 00:20:53.588
Cleven is sitting in the cockpit,
and his copilot said, in so many words,


305
00:20:53.588 --> 00:20:55.715
"We gotta get out of here.
Let's hit the bail out bell."


306
00:20:55.715 --> 00:20:57.884
Cleven said,
"We gotta get to the target.


307
00:20:57.884 --> 00:21:00.136
We're gonna complete the bomb run."

308
00:21:00.136 --> 00:21:05.475
Five minutes before we got to
the target, everything stopped.


309
00:21:05.475 --> 00:21:07.435
No fighters, no flak, no nothing.

310
00:21:08.270 --> 00:21:10.855
We succeeded in dropping our bombs.

311
00:21:14.025 --> 00:21:16.111
<i>Perilously low on fuel,</i>

312
00:21:16.111 --> 00:21:21.283
<i>the Regensburg group fought its way
over the Alps down to North Africa,</i>


313
00:21:21.283 --> 00:21:25.996
<i>while the Schweinfurt group flew straight
into the full brunt of the Luftwaffe.</i>


314
00:21:26.871 --> 00:21:30.250
So that means for the Germans,
they get up and ravage LeMay's guys,


315
00:21:30.250 --> 00:21:33.587
then they get to land and have
a schnapps and rearm and refuel too.


316
00:21:33.587 --> 00:21:35.463
And then they get to hit
the Schweinfurt guys.


317
00:21:39.217 --> 00:21:44.556
The whole Luftwaffe jumped on the
Schweinfurt group and just shattered them.


318
00:21:51.855 --> 00:21:53.982
<i>Having made it to North Africa
by day's end,</i>


319
00:21:54.566 --> 00:21:58.695
<i>the crews of the 100th Bomb Group were
battle-worn and weary,</i>


320
00:21:59.237 --> 00:22:01.573
<i>but feeling lucky to be alive.</i>

321
00:22:02.949 --> 00:22:05.827
<i>Any commander
that had to commit forces to combat</i>


322
00:22:05.827 --> 00:22:07.787
<i>when they were outnumbered</i>

323
00:22:07.787 --> 00:22:10.081
and with equipment which was not suitable

324
00:22:10.081 --> 00:22:15.837
and with a minimum of training,
faced very tough decisions.


325
00:22:16.963 --> 00:22:19.174
It's like sentencing men to death.

326
00:22:23.637 --> 00:22:28.975
I had landed in England
in the summer of 1943,


327
00:22:30.227 --> 00:22:33.563
and I was sent
to the 100th Bomb Group.

328
00:22:33.563 --> 00:22:36.524
Rosie Rosenthal arrived at the group

329
00:22:36.524 --> 00:22:40.779
as a replacement crew
for crews that were lost.


330
00:22:41.363 --> 00:22:45.367
Egan had gotten word that
this kid, Rosie, was a pretty good flyer.


331
00:22:45.367 --> 00:22:48.995
And so, Egan took him out
and ran him through the struts


332
00:22:48.995 --> 00:22:51.081
and said, "I want you in my squadron."

333
00:22:54.918 --> 00:22:56.711
I happened to be in the bar.

334
00:22:56.711 --> 00:23:03.301
And I was having my usual Scotch
and felt this tap on my shoulder


335
00:23:03.802 --> 00:23:06.930
and turned around,
and here was the squadron commander.


336
00:23:07.514 --> 00:23:10.433
He said, "Lucky, you better go home
and get some sleep.


337
00:23:11.101 --> 00:23:12.435
You're flying tomorrow."

338
00:23:16.565 --> 00:23:20.277
<i>When the weather over Germany
cleared on October 8th,</i>


339
00:23:20.277 --> 00:23:24.281
<i>the Americans launched a succession
of maximum-effort missions</i>


340
00:23:24.281 --> 00:23:27.409
<i>to take out aircraft manufacturing plants.</i>

341
00:23:28.201 --> 00:23:31.913
<i>The airmen would
eventually call it Black Week.</i>


342
00:23:32.622 --> 00:23:36.418
<i>On October 8th,

343
00:23:36.418 --> 00:23:38.920
<i>for a raid on Bremen and Vegesack.</i>

344
00:23:38.920 --> 00:23:41.756
<i>They were loaded with
two and a half million pounds of bombs.</i>


345
00:23:41.756 --> 00:23:44.634
<i>Two and three-quarter million
rounds of ammunition.</i>


346
00:23:46.553 --> 00:23:50.056
As we came off the target,
out of the corner of my eye,


347
00:23:50.056 --> 00:23:56.396
I saw this flight of two Fw 190s
aiming directly for us.


348
00:23:56.396 --> 00:23:59.858
He shot down the ship
directly in front of me,


349
00:23:59.858 --> 00:24:03.778
and it blew them out of the formation,
and they exploded.


350
00:24:05.113 --> 00:24:06.781
The group was decimated.

351
00:24:06.781 --> 00:24:10.660
We were shot clear out of the formation.
Our number three engine was on fire.


352
00:24:11.912 --> 00:24:13.413
Cleven tried to move up

353
00:24:13.413 --> 00:24:16.541
and take over the group
when he was shot down.


354
00:24:17.876 --> 00:24:19.002
Cleven, he got hit.

355
00:24:19.711 --> 00:24:21.713
There's a lot of chaos in the plane.

356
00:24:21.713 --> 00:24:23.632
The cockpit caught fire. 
They gotta bail.

357
00:24:27.427 --> 00:24:28.970
Gale Cleven is shot down.

358
00:24:28.970 --> 00:24:33.141
This is a huge hole
left in the 100th Bomb Group at this time.


359
00:24:33.141 --> 00:24:36.519
And for all intents and purposes,
everybody thinks he's dead.


360
00:24:37.854 --> 00:24:43.360
That was the first time that I doubted
that I really was gonna get back.


361
00:24:44.361 --> 00:24:49.157
My plane, Rosie's Riveters,
was badly damaged,


362
00:24:49.157 --> 00:24:51.368
and a couple of engines were out.

363
00:24:53.203 --> 00:24:54.955
After we dropped our bombs,

364
00:24:54.955 --> 00:24:58.708
I brought what was left
of the formation home,


365
00:24:58.708 --> 00:25:01.127
which was only six airplanes.

366
00:25:04.422 --> 00:25:08.468
I mean, imagine the morale,
to lose all those crews in one day.


367
00:25:09.052 --> 00:25:11.346
What they would try to do
is clean out the barracks.


368
00:25:11.346 --> 00:25:13.431
As soon as a plane went down,
they'd clean it out.


369
00:25:13.431 --> 00:25:15.976
So, you'd walk into an empty barracks.

370
00:25:17.310 --> 00:25:20.814
Egan was in London on leave,

371
00:25:20.814 --> 00:25:23.608
and he got word
that Cleven had been shot down.


372
00:25:24.859 --> 00:25:28.738
Egan was so incensed that
he immediately canceled his leave


373
00:25:28.738 --> 00:25:33.493
and returned to the base,
and said, "I'm leading the next mission."


374
00:25:34.244 --> 00:25:37.205
<i>The Münster raid
was a city-busting operation,</i>


375
00:25:37.205 --> 00:25:39.332
<i>a new thing for the Eighth Air Force.</i>

376
00:25:39.332 --> 00:25:43.753
<i>The target was a strategically essential
rail yard in the city center</i>


377
00:25:43.753 --> 00:25:47.632
<i>and also a neighborhood
of workers' housing that abutted it.</i>


378
00:25:48.258 --> 00:25:53.388
<i>In the fight against Nazi tyranny,
human flesh and bone became a target,</i>


379
00:25:53.388 --> 00:25:56.600
<i>an essential part
of the Reich's war machine.</i>


380
00:25:56.600 --> 00:25:58.602
There was tension in the room.

381
00:25:58.602 --> 00:26:01.688
A lot of the airmen,
for the first time ever,


382
00:26:01.688 --> 00:26:03.148
questioned the mission.

383
00:26:03.732 --> 00:26:05.650
Egan makes a speech.

384
00:26:05.650 --> 00:26:10.322
They were gonna fly this one for Cleven,
and this is a revenge raid.


385
00:26:14.826 --> 00:26:19.956
Because we had high losses,
our group was pretty well banged up,


386
00:26:20.457 --> 00:26:24.419
and we could only
put 13 planes in the air.


387
00:26:26.046 --> 00:26:28.715
When it came to German fighter attacks,

388
00:26:28.715 --> 00:26:34.179
if your formations were loose,
if you had 13 aircraft as opposed to 18,


389
00:26:34.179 --> 00:26:36.556
the Germans are gonna
attack the lesser target.


390
00:26:36.556 --> 00:26:40.810
We were immediately attacked
by over 200 German fighter aircraft.


391
00:26:41.394 --> 00:26:46.566
Two Me 109s came in behind us
and killed our tail gunner.


392
00:26:46.566 --> 00:26:50.403
I was sprayed with shrapnel flak
from an exploding cannon shell


393
00:26:50.403 --> 00:26:51.947
and knocked to the floor.

394
00:26:51.947 --> 00:26:54.824
It was clear
that the airplane was out of control,


395
00:26:54.824 --> 00:26:57.077
and we were going to go down.

396
00:26:57.619 --> 00:27:00.789
I remember we were about 21-- 22,000 feet.

397
00:27:00.789 --> 00:27:04.876
The ground looked a million miles away,
but I had no choice.


398
00:27:04.876 --> 00:27:07.295
I had to go
out, and so I did.

399
00:27:15.762 --> 00:27:20.183
We went down the flight line,
and we kept waiting around.


400
00:27:24.521 --> 00:27:26.898
Finally, one of ours came in.

401
00:27:28.066 --> 00:27:30.610
Only one airplane
of the 100th had returned.


402
00:27:31.111 --> 00:27:33.947
Rosenthal was the man
that was flying that airplane.


403
00:27:33.947 --> 00:27:38.743
So, he had seen
his share of rough times.

404
00:27:41.037 --> 00:27:43.915
We returned to the officers' club.

405
00:27:43.915 --> 00:27:46.835
There was an eerie silence there.

406
00:27:46.835 --> 00:27:49.963
There were a few people
who hadn't flown the mission,


407
00:27:50.589 --> 00:27:53.216
and nobody seemed to approach us.

408
00:27:53.216 --> 00:27:55.135
We were sort of left by ourselves.

409
00:27:55.135 --> 00:27:57.637
It was a very strange feeling.

410
00:27:59.222 --> 00:28:04.311
We certainly felt the loss
of the people that had been shot down.


411
00:28:04.311 --> 00:28:10.942
I especially lost my very best friend
on the Münster mission.


412
00:28:14.529 --> 00:28:17.991
When Bucky Egan and Cleven
were shot down,


413
00:28:17.991 --> 00:28:21.036
it was really a tremendous morale factor

414
00:28:21.036 --> 00:28:24.831
because everybody just assumed
they were invincible.


415
00:28:26.625 --> 00:28:30.587
<i>The Münster mission was
the greatest air battle up to that time.</i>


416
00:28:30.587 --> 00:28:33.381
<i>Not just a raid, but a titanic struggle</i>

417
00:28:33.381 --> 00:28:37.052
<i>between two large
and murderous air armies.</i>


418
00:28:37.052 --> 00:28:40.931
<i>The 100th had arrived in England
four months before Münster</i>


419
00:28:40.931 --> 00:28:43.850
<i>with 140 flying officers.</i>

420
00:28:43.850 --> 00:28:48.897
<i>After Münster, only three of them
were still able to fly and fight.</i>


421
00:28:49.397 --> 00:28:52.108
This kind of record got around,

422
00:28:52.108 --> 00:28:54.402
and people became worried about us.

423
00:28:54.402 --> 00:28:56.404
They called us the Bloody Hundredth.

424
00:28:58.740 --> 00:29:00.450
When you're an airman, and you go out,

425
00:29:00.450 --> 00:29:02.577
you have four hours of pure terror.

426
00:29:02.577 --> 00:29:04.996
All of a sudden, you get on your bicycle,
go to the local pub,


427
00:29:04.996 --> 00:29:07.999
drink a beer, go out with a local girl,
go back to base,


428
00:29:07.999 --> 00:29:09.334
sit nice and peaceful.

429
00:29:09.334 --> 00:29:12.504
Then, the next day, you're up,
and you're back into the terror again.


430
00:29:15.090 --> 00:29:22.055
This had the ultimate result,
in some cases, of causing people to crack.


431
00:29:25.642 --> 00:29:27.143
<i>After Black Week,</i>

432
00:29:27.143 --> 00:29:30.313
<i>morale in the Eighth
plummeted to a new low,</i>


433
00:29:30.313 --> 00:29:32.899
<i>and commanders worried about crew revolts.</i>

434
00:29:33.441 --> 00:29:35.944
<i>There were distressing reports
from flight surgeons</i>


435
00:29:35.944 --> 00:29:40.949
<i>and air force psychiatrists
of abnormal behavior among crewmen</i>


436
00:29:40.949 --> 00:29:46.621
<i>as combat insidiously shook the moorings
of airmen's self-control.</i>


437
00:29:46.621 --> 00:29:48.707
I have seen instances

438
00:29:48.707 --> 00:29:54.004
where they weren't in control enough
to just walk out of the airplane.


439
00:29:55.005 --> 00:29:57.716
Those were individuals
that were on the verge


440
00:29:57.716 --> 00:30:01.094
of what we called
victims of combat fatigue.


441
00:30:03.388 --> 00:30:06.141
<i>We have learned that
many of these men with neurotic reactions</i>


442
00:30:06.141 --> 00:30:07.392
<i>can recover quickly</i>

443
00:30:07.392 --> 00:30:10.312
<i>when the battle situation
has been left behind temporarily.</i>


444
00:30:10.812 --> 00:30:13.440
<i>Fundamentally, we must depend
for this recovery</i>


445
00:30:13.440 --> 00:30:16.151
<i>on the patient's own recuperative powers.</i>

446
00:30:16.151 --> 00:30:19.988
<i>But these powers can best be
exercised away from a hospital atmosphere.</i>


447
00:30:22.198 --> 00:30:26.703
We would try to get them
out of the wartime environment


448
00:30:26.703 --> 00:30:30.540
for a few days and
sent to the rest home.

449
00:30:30.540 --> 00:30:32.500
We called it the Flak House.

450
00:30:33.543 --> 00:30:37.631
Oftentimes, it was effective.
Sometimes it was not.


451
00:30:39.132 --> 00:30:42.010
This was a problem that all commanders
had to deal with


452
00:30:42.010 --> 00:30:46.473
because there are some people
whose chemical and mental makeup


453
00:30:46.473 --> 00:30:49.184
is such that
they just can't stand this sort of thing.


454
00:30:49.851 --> 00:30:53.355
We had to immediately remove those people

455
00:30:53.355 --> 00:30:56.483
from the crew and from the base

456
00:30:56.483 --> 00:31:00.654
because that sort of attitude
was contagious,


457
00:31:00.654 --> 00:31:04.491
and we couldn't afford to have it affect
the morale of the rest of the people


458
00:31:04.491 --> 00:31:08.703
that were going out every day
and continuing to perform their duties.


459
00:31:10.997 --> 00:31:13.875
You can argue not only
has the Allied air forces


460
00:31:13.875 --> 00:31:17.045
don't have any sense of air superiority
over Germany and Europe,


461
00:31:17.045 --> 00:31:19.005
you could argue
they're losing the air war.


462
00:31:20.465 --> 00:31:23.843
You know, we did not drop into
a pickle barrel all the time.


463
00:31:23.843 --> 00:31:27.138
We would scatter bombs
even on good, clear days,


464
00:31:27.138 --> 00:31:29.683
several miles from the intended target.

465
00:31:30.767 --> 00:31:32.394
They couldn't hit their targets,

466
00:31:32.394 --> 00:31:35.981
and they were much more,
themselves, a target


467
00:31:35.981 --> 00:31:39.693
for German fighter defense.
So the force was being slaughtered.


468
00:31:40.443 --> 00:31:43.822
<i>Every few cubic feet
of this pile contains a plane,</i>


469
00:31:43.822 --> 00:31:46.241
<i>22,000 hours of American labor.</i>

470
00:31:47.200 --> 00:31:50.912
<i>Every yard of it means
ten American boys dead or captured.</i>


471
00:31:56.251 --> 00:31:59.838
Probably the most dreadful thing
that one could expect was to be shot down.


472
00:32:00.463 --> 00:32:02.257
We always knew it was possible.

473
00:32:02.257 --> 00:32:05.218
Being young
and thinking that we were immortal,


474
00:32:05.218 --> 00:32:07.721
we always figured that
they might get everybody else,


475
00:32:07.721 --> 00:32:09.055
but they wouldn't get us.

476
00:32:09.973 --> 00:32:12.726
I knew how much
my mother worried about me,


477
00:32:12.726 --> 00:32:14.644
and I knew that she would be getting

478
00:32:14.644 --> 00:32:18.648
a missing-in-action telegram
from the War Department,


479
00:32:18.648 --> 00:32:21.192
and she would not know
what happened to me.


480
00:32:23.570 --> 00:32:26.865
<i>Airmen were given parachutes
but not trained how to use them,</i>


481
00:32:26.865 --> 00:32:31.077
<i>and they were given only scant training
in escape and evasion tactics.</i>


482
00:32:31.077 --> 00:32:35.290
<i>Nor were they properly warned
when civilians in bombed-out towns</i>


483
00:32:35.290 --> 00:32:38.710
<i>began to attack downed airmen
in increasing numbers.</i>


484
00:32:40.837 --> 00:32:43.215
Cleven, he goes down,

485
00:32:43.215 --> 00:32:46.760
and he can see
that farmers are gathering all around.


486
00:32:46.760 --> 00:32:47.886
The next thing he remembers,

487
00:32:47.886 --> 00:32:51.514
a farmer has a pitchfork
a ninth of an inch in his chest


488
00:32:51.514 --> 00:32:52.682
and wants to press down on it.

489
00:32:53.350 --> 00:32:56.269
Some local Luftwaffe police show up.

490
00:32:58.355 --> 00:33:01.733
I was taken to
a German Air Force airfield

491
00:33:01.733 --> 00:33:03.109
that was a collection point

492
00:33:03.109 --> 00:33:06.279
for all of the American flyers
who had been captured that day.


493
00:33:11.743 --> 00:33:13.620
I got interviewed by this guy,

494
00:33:13.620 --> 00:33:17.332
and he congratulated me on my promotion.

495
00:33:18.250 --> 00:33:22.420
I had just gotten first lieutenant
about three days before.


496
00:33:22.420 --> 00:33:25.006
That sort of took me by surprise.

497
00:33:25.006 --> 00:33:27.759
And he hands me a 3-by-5 card,

498
00:33:27.759 --> 00:33:33.056
and there's my name and birth date,
my parents' name, and my address.


499
00:33:34.808 --> 00:33:37.686
The Germans had spies
in the United States


500
00:33:37.686 --> 00:33:40.188
send them their hometown newspaper.

501
00:33:40.188 --> 00:33:41.356
So, they relax you

502
00:33:41.356 --> 00:33:43.984
to get this sense that
you're having a conversation,


503
00:33:43.984 --> 00:33:46.152
and they know everything about you.

504
00:33:46.152 --> 00:33:48.280
<i>This cagey interrogation technique</i>

505
00:33:48.280 --> 00:33:51.950
<i>was sometimes effective
in persuading unsuspecting airmen</i>


506
00:33:51.950 --> 00:33:55.495
<i>to give up information
they considered inconsequential,</i>


507
00:33:55.495 --> 00:33:58.415
<i>but which master interrogators prized.</i>

508
00:33:59.332 --> 00:34:02.669
The next morning, they
put us in a boxcar.

509
00:34:02.669 --> 00:34:05.839
There were 30 or 40
of us in the boxcar.

510
00:34:07.132 --> 00:34:09.092
None of us knew what was gonna happen.

511
00:34:15.599 --> 00:34:17.601
I can remember walking through the gate,

512
00:34:17.601 --> 00:34:19.978
and there were big, wooden stakes there,

513
00:34:19.978 --> 00:34:22.731
and there was barbed wire
all over the place,


514
00:34:22.731 --> 00:34:25.775
and there were guard towers
at all the corners.


515
00:34:25.775 --> 00:34:30.195
And there was about a 10- or 12-foot space
between the big fence,


516
00:34:30.195 --> 00:34:32.365
and then there was a smaller fence.

517
00:34:32.365 --> 00:34:35.367
We were told not to
go over the small fence, or we'd be shot.


518
00:34:36.620 --> 00:34:38.954
The American POWs who were there,

519
00:34:38.954 --> 00:34:41.499
many of whom
were members of the 100th Bomb Group


520
00:34:41.499 --> 00:34:44.544
who had been shot down
before I was shot down.


521
00:34:44.544 --> 00:34:46.421
The minute they saw us come in,
well, they--


522
00:34:46.421 --> 00:34:49.132
Some of them laughed and said,
"Well, we've been expecting you.


523
00:34:49.132 --> 00:34:50.217
You're finally here."

524
00:34:51.635 --> 00:34:56.139
<i>Cleven and Egan arrived at
Stalag Luft III within days of each other.</i>


525
00:34:56.139 --> 00:34:59.726
<i>Cleven was immediately wisecracking
with the injured Egan,</i>


526
00:34:59.726 --> 00:35:02.312
<i>and soon, the two were roommates again</i>

527
00:35:02.312 --> 00:35:05.607
<i>and quickly assumed leadership roles
inside the camp.</i>


528
00:35:05.607 --> 00:35:08.318
We lived together, cooked together,

529
00:35:08.318 --> 00:35:11.279
washed our clothes together,
showered together.


530
00:35:11.279 --> 00:35:14.824
Showers were once a week,
maybe, if you were lucky.


531
00:35:15.825 --> 00:35:18.286
Life inside the Stalag Luft camps

532
00:35:18.286 --> 00:35:19.996
was very, very regimented.

533
00:35:19.996 --> 00:35:23.291
Everything was done in a military way
to keep their minds busy,


534
00:35:23.291 --> 00:35:26.378
to keep discipline,
and basically to keep everybody alive.


535
00:35:31.925 --> 00:35:34.135
<i>At a secret meeting
at the Tehran Conference</i>


536
00:35:34.135 --> 00:35:36.137
<i>in late November 1943,</i>

537
00:35:36.137 --> 00:35:41.810
<i>Roosevelt, Churchill and Stalin agreed to
a second front against Nazi Germany</i>


538
00:35:41.810 --> 00:35:45.564
<i>to be planned and executed principally by
the Americans and the British.</i>


539
00:35:47.065 --> 00:35:49.526
<i>There was to be
a massive amphibious assault,</i>


540
00:35:49.526 --> 00:35:51.027
<i>the greatest in history,</i>

541
00:35:51.027 --> 00:35:55.699
<i>across five beaches in Normandy, France,
code-named "Overlord."</i>


542
00:35:55.699 --> 00:36:00.954
<i>It was scheduled for May 1944,
just six months away.</i>


543
00:36:01.830 --> 00:36:04.374
General Eisenhower
has been brought to London.


544
00:36:05.709 --> 00:36:09.880
He said that we can't launch the fleet
until you knock out the Luftwaffe.


545
00:36:09.880 --> 00:36:12.424
That is our mission now.

546
00:36:12.424 --> 00:36:17.846
We were aware
that no land invasion can occur


547
00:36:17.846 --> 00:36:20.765
unless air superiority has been achieved.

548
00:36:22.309 --> 00:36:25.145
The ultimate goal
was to shoot down so many fighters


549
00:36:25.145 --> 00:36:27.689
that the Germans could no longer
put up a fighter defense.


550
00:36:30.901 --> 00:36:36.781
<i>We had been having
very high losses due to fighter action.</i>


551
00:36:37.449 --> 00:36:42.704
<i>And so, a rush program at home
began to get us more and more fighters.</i>


552
00:36:43.413 --> 00:36:46.374
Late 1943,
a fighter aircraft arrived in England,


553
00:36:46.374 --> 00:36:49.377
and it was the fighter plane that
the Eighth Air Force had been waiting for.


554
00:36:49.377 --> 00:36:51.213
It was the P-51 Mustang.

555
00:36:52.214 --> 00:36:54.466
<i>The Mustang. The P-51.</i>

556
00:36:54.466 --> 00:36:56.927
<i>The longest-range fighter in the world.</i>

557
00:36:56.927 --> 00:37:01.348
<i>Speed, fast climb, quick dive, tight turn.</i>

558
00:37:01.890 --> 00:37:03.934
When P-51s came over,

559
00:37:03.934 --> 00:37:08.688
they had the range to accompany us
to the target and back.


560
00:37:08.688 --> 00:37:11.900
And they also fixed up the 47s

561
00:37:11.900 --> 00:37:15.528
and put wing tanks on them
so that they could accompany us.


562
00:37:17.656 --> 00:37:21.534
When we went to Emden,
and I saw all those gorgeous P-51s,


563
00:37:21.534 --> 00:37:23.912
I thought, maybe for the first time,
"I'm gonna get through."


564
00:37:25.789 --> 00:37:26.915
The primary mission

565
00:37:26.915 --> 00:37:28.833
is not to protect the bombers
and get 'em home safely.


566
00:37:28.833 --> 00:37:33.129
It'll be to go after the Luftwaffe
in the air and on the ground.


567
00:37:37.551 --> 00:37:40.178
<i>Sunday morning 20 February,</i>

568
00:37:40.720 --> 00:37:42.973
<i>we prepared for the heaviest assault</i>

569
00:37:42.973 --> 00:37:46.851
<i>in the history of the American
Strategic Air Forces up to that time.</i>


570
00:37:48.019 --> 00:37:50.772
<i>This was the prelude to invasion.</i>

571
00:37:52.065 --> 00:37:57.070
They planned a succession of
continuous raids one day after the other.


572
00:37:57.070 --> 00:37:59.030
This is gonna decide the whole war.

573
00:38:05.787 --> 00:38:07.831
<i>Day after day, month after month,</i>

574
00:38:08.331 --> 00:38:13.503
<i>Mustang, Thunderbolt against
the Me 109s and the Fw 190s.</i>


575
00:38:13.503 --> 00:38:16.673
<i>Our fighters attack, attack, attack.</i>

576
00:38:17.382 --> 00:38:20.635
<i>Our victory column soared
at the rate of 4-to-1.</i>


577
00:38:21.928 --> 00:38:25.265
The casualty rate for
German pilots on the western front


578
00:38:25.265 --> 00:38:29.769
between January and May 1944 was 99%.

579
00:38:29.769 --> 00:38:31.855
I mean, they just get butchered.

580
00:38:34.024 --> 00:38:36.693
It wasn't until
the Mustang really got involved in the war


581
00:38:36.693 --> 00:38:39.946
that America and England
gained air superiority over Germany.


582
00:38:41.281 --> 00:38:42.908
If you want to go
to the heart of the enemy


583
00:38:42.908 --> 00:38:47.245
and be sure the Luftwaffe will be
pulled into the sky, you go to Berlin.


584
00:38:48.288 --> 00:38:50.832
When they had the briefing,
and they pulled the curtain back,


585
00:38:50.832 --> 00:38:53.501
and the tape went
all the way to Berlin,

586
00:38:54.211 --> 00:38:57.797
first it was just stunned silence
and then just a shout.


587
00:39:01.468 --> 00:39:03.470
<i>You can't hear what's going on down there</i>

588
00:39:03.470 --> 00:39:05.138
<i>five miles below you,</i>

589
00:39:05.680 --> 00:39:09.726
<i>but marshaling yards
and chemical tanks, ships and warehouses,</i>


590
00:39:09.726 --> 00:39:14.356
<i>spare engines, and ball bearing factories
are disintegrating in molten chaos.</i>


591
00:39:15.565 --> 00:39:20.153
<i>This would be the American's
first foray into bombing Berlin.</i>


592
00:39:20.153 --> 00:39:23.240
<i>It would be the toughest target
the Eighth ever attacked,</i>


593
00:39:23.823 --> 00:39:25.158
<i>but it had to be done.</i>

594
00:39:27.285 --> 00:39:29.496
I can say that if
I had been in Germany

595
00:39:29.496 --> 00:39:35.126
and witnessed, everyday, hordes of bombers
coming over and dropping bombs,


596
00:39:35.126 --> 00:39:37.796
it would have had
a very adverse effect on my morale.


597
00:39:37.796 --> 00:39:41.841
It must have had an adverse effect morale
on the civilians and military alike.


598
00:39:47.806 --> 00:39:51.017
One of the worst things
about being a prisoner of war


599
00:39:51.518 --> 00:39:54.771
is that you don't know how long
you're gonna be held captive.


600
00:39:54.771 --> 00:39:57.774
It's not as if you've been given
a fixed sentence.


601
00:39:57.774 --> 00:40:01.444
You're going to be there
until you either escape or it's all over.


602
00:40:02.237 --> 00:40:03.947
I did start a tunnel.

603
00:40:04.447 --> 00:40:07.492
They had an old toilet
that had a tile floor


604
00:40:07.492 --> 00:40:10.370
and I figured, well,
let's see if we can do something here.


605
00:40:10.370 --> 00:40:14.708
And my object was
to have these removable tiles


606
00:40:14.708 --> 00:40:16.209
and we could start digging.

607
00:40:16.209 --> 00:40:18.670
The guards caught that almost immediately.

608
00:40:20.213 --> 00:40:25.176
Some 76 British prisoners
tunneled out of the compound


609
00:40:25.176 --> 00:40:28.889
immediately adjacent to us
through a tunnel that they dug.


610
00:40:28.889 --> 00:40:31.182
It was known as the Great Escape.

611
00:40:31.182 --> 00:40:37.355
All but two were recaptured,
and 50 were executed by the Germans.


612
00:40:38.440 --> 00:40:41.401
What little decent relations
we had with the Germans


613
00:40:41.401 --> 00:40:43.361
evaporated completely after that.

614
00:40:46.698 --> 00:40:49.993
One day I received
a telephone call and they said,


615
00:40:49.993 --> 00:40:52.245
"General LeMay would like
to speak to you."


616
00:40:52.245 --> 00:40:55.332
He said,
"Jeffrey, I need a group commander


617
00:40:55.332 --> 00:40:58.251
at the 95th Bomb Group
and the 100th Bomb Group.


618
00:40:58.251 --> 00:41:00.003
You can take your choice."

619
00:41:00.670 --> 00:41:03.215
The 95th could essentially do no wrong.

620
00:41:03.215 --> 00:41:05.217
They lost the minimum number of airplanes.

621
00:41:05.217 --> 00:41:09.512
Their bombing record was good,
and I figured that I could do more


622
00:41:09.512 --> 00:41:11.473
for the 100th than
I could for the 95th.

623
00:41:11.473 --> 00:41:15.185
So, I called him back
and I told him with his permission,


624
00:41:15.185 --> 00:41:17.312
I would accept the 100th Bomb Group.

625
00:41:17.312 --> 00:41:19.439
And I asked him,
"When do you want me to report?"


626
00:41:19.439 --> 00:41:20.732
And he said, "This afternoon."

627
00:41:25.237 --> 00:41:30.367
My first action was to ask General LeMay
if he would take the 100th


628
00:41:30.367 --> 00:41:33.912
off of operations
for two days and he granted that.


629
00:41:33.912 --> 00:41:35.664
And so, over the next two days,

630
00:41:35.664 --> 00:41:37.749
four hours in the morning
and four hours in the afternoon,


631
00:41:37.749 --> 00:41:42.128
we flew every airplane
in the 100th Bomb Group in formation.


632
00:41:42.963 --> 00:41:49.344
Tom Jeffrey, he was dynamic,
charismatic and knowledgeable,


633
00:41:49.344 --> 00:41:53.181
not only about the aircraft,
but about combat flying.


634
00:41:54.724 --> 00:41:56.768
I had people in the lead airplane

635
00:41:56.768 --> 00:41:58.103
photographing the formation

636
00:41:58.103 --> 00:42:01.565
so that we could identify
who was flying good and who wasn't.


637
00:42:01.565 --> 00:42:05.402
And then I took an old airplane
and circled around the formation,


638
00:42:05.402 --> 00:42:08.446
back and forth,
and tried to herd 'em into position.


639
00:42:08.446 --> 00:42:11.032
The commanding officers
were just blue in the face


640
00:42:11.032 --> 00:42:14.035
about us keeping our formations tight.

641
00:42:14.035 --> 00:42:16.830
You think you're tight
and they say tighten 'em up more.


642
00:42:17.831 --> 00:42:19.874
At the end of two days,

643
00:42:19.874 --> 00:42:24.004
the 100th was flying the best formation
that I have ever seen.


644
00:42:25.130 --> 00:42:30.343
It was not until Jeffrey came
did we become a superb group.


645
00:42:31.136 --> 00:42:33.722
I think the best
group in the air force.

646
00:42:37.809 --> 00:42:42.314
An Eighth Air Force bomber crew
had a tour of duty of 25 missions.


647
00:42:42.314 --> 00:42:44.357
Once you completed your 25 missions,

648
00:42:44.357 --> 00:42:46.484
you were rotated back home
to the United States.


649
00:42:47.736 --> 00:42:52.365
Upon completion,
I was told that I could either remain


650
00:42:52.365 --> 00:42:58.163
and accept command of a squadron
or rotate back to the States.


651
00:42:58.163 --> 00:43:04.419
I concluded that
I had been extremely fortunate


652
00:43:04.419 --> 00:43:09.799
and lucky to have survived
and that I shouldn't push it any further.


653
00:43:09.799 --> 00:43:13.094
So, I elected to return.

654
00:43:14.888 --> 00:43:17.265
Rosie Rosenthal completes his 25 missions

655
00:43:17.265 --> 00:43:21.186
on March 8th, 1944,
on a raid over Berlin.

656
00:43:21.895 --> 00:43:25.649
The crew urged me
to buzz the field when we returned.


657
00:43:25.649 --> 00:43:29.152
I was a very conservative pilot
and I said, "I don't think so."


658
00:43:29.903 --> 00:43:33.406
But on the way back,
I said, "What the heck."


659
00:43:33.406 --> 00:43:38.078
And headed right for the tower
and everybody hit the deck there


660
00:43:38.662 --> 00:43:42.457
and I buzzed the field
three or four times and then came in.


661
00:43:42.457 --> 00:43:44.459
And then somebody approached me and said,

662
00:43:44.459 --> 00:43:48.547
"Rosie, did you know
that General Huglin was there?


663
00:43:49.047 --> 00:43:52.467
And he hit the deck and he--
his clothes are all messed up."


664
00:43:52.467 --> 00:43:56.263
And there coming into the debriefing room
was General Huglin.


665
00:43:56.263 --> 00:43:58.640
He came over and grabbed my hand

666
00:43:58.640 --> 00:44:01.434
and he said,
"One hell of a buzz job, Rosie."


667
00:44:02.519 --> 00:44:05.480
Everyone knew
that D-Day was on the horizon


668
00:44:05.480 --> 00:44:10.235
and finishing off the Reich
was a big objective for Rosie.


669
00:44:10.735 --> 00:44:14.656
To leave here is to
leave the center of the universe.


670
00:44:14.656 --> 00:44:18.034
And that's when I decided
to continue flying,


671
00:44:18.034 --> 00:44:22.664
and ultimately,
I was assigned to be a squadron commander.


672
00:44:23.582 --> 00:44:27.752
<i>On this day,

673
00:44:27.752 --> 00:44:31.506
<i>inflicted severe damage
on German defenses along the coast.</i>


674
00:44:35.886 --> 00:44:39.180
I had flown over to France
to drop some bombs on some target.


675
00:44:39.180 --> 00:44:42.559
And when I returned,
I was met at the airplane


676
00:44:42.559 --> 00:44:48.315
and told that I was to report to
General LeMay's headquarters that evening.


677
00:44:49.566 --> 00:44:54.988
General LeMay marched in
and announced to us that the Allied Forces


678
00:44:54.988 --> 00:44:58.783
would land on the beaches of Normandy
the next morning.


679
00:44:58.783 --> 00:45:03.163
But he said in order for you
to thoroughly understand


680
00:45:03.163 --> 00:45:06.458
the importance of this occasion,

681
00:45:06.458 --> 00:45:11.463
that the Eighth Air Force will expend
every airplane that it has


682
00:45:11.463 --> 00:45:14.925
in its inventory to be sure
that these people got ashore.


683
00:45:16.176 --> 00:45:18.386
I remember coming to the briefing

684
00:45:18.386 --> 00:45:22.766
and when they moved the curtain
from the map and there were cheers.


685
00:45:22.766 --> 00:45:25.769
I had never heard
this kind of thing from the crews.


686
00:45:25.769 --> 00:45:27.687
Finally, D
-Day had arrived.

687
00:45:31.775 --> 00:45:34.319
<i>Soldiers, sailors and airmen</i>

688
00:45:34.319 --> 00:45:36.404
<i>of the Allied Expeditionary Force,</i>

689
00:45:37.948 --> 00:45:41.034
<i>you are about to embark upon
the Great Crusade</i>


690
00:45:41.034 --> 00:45:43.703
<i>toward which we have
striven these many months.</i>


691
00:45:44.621 --> 00:45:46.581
<i>The eyes of the world are upon you.</i>

692
00:45:48.041 --> 00:45:50.168
<i>Your task will not be an easy one.</i>

693
00:45:51.044 --> 00:45:54.631
<i>Your enemy is well trained,
well equipped and battle-hardened.</i>


694
00:45:55.131 --> 00:45:56.800
<i>He will fight savagely.</i>

695
00:45:57.676 --> 00:46:02.764
<i>I have full confidence in your courage,
devotion to duty and skill in battle.</i>


696
00:46:03.723 --> 00:46:07.018
<i>We will accept
nothing less than full victory.</i>


697
00:46:10.480 --> 00:46:12.065
As we flew over the channel,

698
00:46:12.065 --> 00:46:16.903
we looked down and saw thousands of ships
in an armada down there.


699
00:46:18.613 --> 00:46:25.495
It was so thrilling one of the crew
started to pray, and we all joined in.


700
00:46:30.584 --> 00:46:34.379
<i>This is Robert St. John
in the NBC newsroom in New York.</i>


701
00:46:34.379 --> 00:46:37.382
<i>This is a momentous hour in world history.</i>

702
00:46:37.966 --> 00:46:42.220
<i>The men of General Dwight Eisenhower
are leaving their landing barges,</i>


703
00:46:42.220 --> 00:46:45.932
<i>fighting their way up the beaches
into the fortress of Nazi Europe.</i>


704
00:46:46.766 --> 00:46:48.560
<i>They are moving in from the sea</i>

705
00:46:48.560 --> 00:46:52.314
<i>to attack the enemy
under a mammoth cloud of fighter planes.</i>


706
00:46:53.565 --> 00:46:56.192
<i>The fury from the
air went on and on.</i>

707
00:46:56.192 --> 00:47:01.156
<i>Our airmen in tactical support of
the ground forces took no rest that day.</i>


708
00:47:01.156 --> 00:47:05.577
<i>Back from one sortie, they gassed up,
loaded their bombs and ammunition belts</i>


709
00:47:05.577 --> 00:47:08.872
<i>and grimly went out again and again.</i>

710
00:47:12.250 --> 00:47:16.630
There was hardly any
air intervention by the Luftwaffe


711
00:47:16.630 --> 00:47:17.923
when we invaded Normandy.

712
00:47:19.132 --> 00:47:21.509
The Air Force really paved the way

713
00:47:21.509 --> 00:47:24.804
for the invasion
across the English Channel.


714
00:47:28.516 --> 00:47:31.061
<i>Germany now had to fight on two fronts,</i>

715
00:47:31.061 --> 00:47:35.357
<i>against the Anglo-American allies
in the west and the Russians in the east.</i>


716
00:47:35.357 --> 00:47:39.361
<i>In August 1944,
the Red Army discovered Majdanek,</i>


717
00:47:39.361 --> 00:47:44.574
<i>an abandoned Nazi concentration and
extermination camp near Lublin, Poland,</i>


718
00:47:44.574 --> 00:47:50.247
<i>indisputable evidence of Hitler's program
to exterminate the Jews of Europe.</i>


719
00:47:56.127 --> 00:47:58.880
<i>Our invasion forces are on the offensive</i>

720
00:47:58.880 --> 00:48:03.927
<i>against Nazi troops who have been
ordered to die rather than retreat.</i>


721
00:48:03.927 --> 00:48:08.139
<i>However, die or retreat they must,
for this attack is being made</i>


722
00:48:08.139 --> 00:48:12.727
<i>with all the strength
the Allied Command can throw into battle.</i>


723
00:48:12.727 --> 00:48:15.313
The army camp had
these clandestine radios


724
00:48:15.313 --> 00:48:19.401
and we knew just about
everything the BBC knew.


725
00:48:19.401 --> 00:48:23.405
When the invasion started in June of '44,

726
00:48:23.405 --> 00:48:25.740
we knew that we weren't
gonna be there forever.


727
00:48:27.033 --> 00:48:30.620
<i>Downed airmen
were still streaming into Stalag Luft III.</i>


728
00:48:30.620 --> 00:48:32.455
<i>Among them, a number of Black pilots</i>

729
00:48:32.455 --> 00:48:36.918
<i>including Second Lieutenants,
Alexander Jefferson and Richard Macon,</i>


730
00:48:36.918 --> 00:48:41.715
<i>who were with the renowned

731
00:48:41.715 --> 00:48:45.051
The Tuskegee pilots painted
a deep red on the tails of their planes.


732
00:48:45.051 --> 00:48:48.221
Even when people didn't know that these
were Black pilots flying the planes


733
00:48:48.221 --> 00:48:50.599
they recognized that they were Red Tails.

734
00:48:51.099 --> 00:48:54.811
We didn't have any concern
about running into the enemy


735
00:48:54.811 --> 00:48:57.856
because we knew that
we were better flyers than they were,


736
00:48:57.856 --> 00:49:00.483
and I would "Ready, aim, fire."

737
00:49:02.319 --> 00:49:04.696
These courageous
Black flyers had been waiting


738
00:49:04.696 --> 00:49:09.618
to contribute to the war effort, and
they distinguished themselves brilliantly.


739
00:49:11.828 --> 00:49:15.665
Within the Air Force,
and especially among the bomber crews


740
00:49:15.665 --> 00:49:20.337
that are making those long dangerous runs,
say that they appreciated the Red Tails


741
00:49:20.337 --> 00:49:23.965
more than any of the other squadrons
that they flew with in the war.


742
00:49:24.758 --> 00:49:27.177
<i>Macon and Jefferson
had been racially segregated</i>


743
00:49:27.177 --> 00:49:29.846
<i>on Air Force bases in America and Italy,</i>

744
00:49:29.846 --> 00:49:31.431
<i>and were shocked to discover</i>

745
00:49:31.431 --> 00:49:34.893
<i>that the barracks
at Stalag Luft III were integrated.</i>


746
00:49:34.893 --> 00:49:36.645
There were approximately 150 men

747
00:49:36.645 --> 00:49:40.065
who had come in to this camp,
and we were lined up.


748
00:49:40.065 --> 00:49:45.487
Finally, down the line
came a long, tall Kentucky hillbilly


749
00:49:46.238 --> 00:49:51.034
and he walked back and says,
"By cracky, I think I'll take this boy."


750
00:49:51.034 --> 00:49:54.371
Colonel walked across and said,
"Lieutenant, you go with him."


751
00:49:55.205 --> 00:49:56.206
"Yes, sir."

752
00:49:57.207 --> 00:49:59.042
The Germans took me into the room

753
00:49:59.042 --> 00:50:03.129
and showed me where I was going to be,
on the third bed up.


754
00:50:03.672 --> 00:50:06.383
I didn't realize
how badly I had been injured.


755
00:50:06.383 --> 00:50:09.052
I was paralyzed from my waist down.

756
00:50:09.052 --> 00:50:11.638
So, once they saw that I couldn't move,

757
00:50:11.638 --> 00:50:14.474
the Germans tried to tell them

758
00:50:14.474 --> 00:50:17.602
who will give up his bottom bunk
for this man.


759
00:50:17.602 --> 00:50:19.062
Nobody moved.

760
00:50:19.062 --> 00:50:23.275
And finally, the guy from Texas said,
"He can have my bunk, I'll go up there."


761
00:50:23.900 --> 00:50:26.486
He and I became the best of friends.

762
00:50:27.404 --> 00:50:30.198
These men had to come together
to survive the prisoner camp.


763
00:50:30.198 --> 00:50:34.744
They let whatever racial attitudes,
racial animosities go or at least lessen


764
00:50:34.744 --> 00:50:37.414
because they had to work together
to keep up each other's spirits


765
00:50:37.414 --> 00:50:38.623
to survive that experience.

766
00:50:40.625 --> 00:50:44.796
<i>One of the last Air Force
operations was to starve the Reich of fuel</i>


767
00:50:44.796 --> 00:50:47.924
<i>by bombing German synthetic oil plants.</i>

768
00:50:47.924 --> 00:50:52.137
<i>The Allies also would need to hit
transportation and storage facilities</i>


769
00:50:52.137 --> 00:50:55.432
<i>for the coal
that powered jet production plants.</i>


770
00:50:55.432 --> 00:50:58.935
<i>This air blockade
would cripple the Reich's war machine</i>


771
00:50:58.935 --> 00:51:01.646
<i>and leave the German army
without adequate air cover</i>


772
00:51:01.646 --> 00:51:04.357
<i>in the culminating battles of the war.</i>

773
00:51:04.357 --> 00:51:07.152
We were in the officers' club
until 1:00 or 2:00 a.m.


774
00:51:07.903 --> 00:51:10.155
Suddenly we heard the announcement:

775
00:51:10.155 --> 00:51:12.157
"Be prepared
for a mission in the morning."


776
00:51:15.076 --> 00:51:18.413
We put up 2,000 heavy bombers.

777
00:51:18.413 --> 00:51:22.417
All you could see was
four-engined bombers to the horizon.


778
00:51:24.961 --> 00:51:27.047
To knock out one
plant in World War II,

779
00:51:27.047 --> 00:51:29.257
a place called Leuna near Merseburg,

780
00:51:29.257 --> 00:51:35.305
it took 6,000 bombers flying
about 40 missions to knock that plant out.


781
00:51:36.640 --> 00:51:40.435
Our group
led one of the biggest raids on Berlin.


782
00:51:40.435 --> 00:51:42.229
It was a very beautiful day.

783
00:51:42.229 --> 00:51:44.981
The sun was shining,
not a cloud in sight.

784
00:51:45.649 --> 00:51:49.819
As we approached the target,
the plane was hit,


785
00:51:49.819 --> 00:51:52.906
but we continued and bombed the target,

786
00:51:52.906 --> 00:51:56.243
knowing that we couldn't
return to our base.


787
00:51:56.826 --> 00:52:00.580
There was smoke and fire in the plane,
and I knew I had to get out.


788
00:52:00.580 --> 00:52:03.166
And when I got out,
I thought I was in heaven.


789
00:52:04.417 --> 00:52:07.879
And suddenly,
I hit the ground and I looked up,


790
00:52:08.672 --> 00:52:11.716
and I saw three soldiers
coming at me with guns.


791
00:52:12.717 --> 00:52:16.846
One of the soldiers raised his gun
and was about to strike me,


792
00:52:16.846 --> 00:52:21.810
and I noticed that he had,
on his hat, the Red Army symbol.


793
00:52:22.477 --> 00:52:25.522
And I yelled, <i>Amerikanski</i>, Roosevelt,

794
00:52:25.522 --> 00:52:28.066
Stalin, Churchill, Pepsi
-Cola,

795
00:52:28.066 --> 00:52:31.528
Coca
-Cola, Lucky Strike.

796
00:52:32.696 --> 00:52:36.491
<i>The Berlin raid
was Rosie's 52nd and final mission.</i>


797
00:52:36.491 --> 00:52:39.869
<i>The most raids
flown by a pilot in the 100th.</i>


798
00:52:39.869 --> 00:52:42.539
<i>After recuperating in a Russian hospital,</i>

799
00:52:42.539 --> 00:52:44.874
<i>Rosie made his way back to Thorpe Abbotts,</i>

800
00:52:44.874 --> 00:52:49.337
<i>where he had flown his first mission
a year and a half earlier.</i>


801
00:52:52.632 --> 00:52:55.886
The Russians were knocking on the door.

802
00:52:55.886 --> 00:52:58.013
We could hear artillery

803
00:52:58.013 --> 00:53:01.474
and other sounds of combat
in the distance.


804
00:53:02.100 --> 00:53:03.602
Hitler debated back and forth:

805
00:53:03.602 --> 00:53:07.230
should we march the prisoners
out of the camp or kill them?


806
00:53:07.230 --> 00:53:09.316
That was a real possibility.

807
00:53:10.025 --> 00:53:11.276
And suddenly, one night,

808
00:53:11.276 --> 00:53:14.946
our American senior officer
was told by the Germans


809
00:53:14.946 --> 00:53:17.407
that we were going to be
evacuated immediately,


810
00:53:17.407 --> 00:53:22.037
and we would be leaving the camp
within an hour to march out on foot.


811
00:53:22.954 --> 00:53:25.707
They just said,
we're moving you for your safety.


812
00:53:26.291 --> 00:53:28.668
That was what they said,
but we all knew better.


813
00:53:30.545 --> 00:53:32.547
The airmen had no idea
where they're going.


814
00:53:32.547 --> 00:53:35.508
They feared Hitler
was going to take American airmen


815
00:53:35.508 --> 00:53:37.719
and use them as human shields.

816
00:53:37.719 --> 00:53:41.097
And it's the worst European winter
in 100 years.


817
00:53:42.474 --> 00:53:44.059
It was bitterly cold.

818
00:53:44.059 --> 00:53:46.603
The snow was about knee-deep,

819
00:53:46.603 --> 00:53:51.024
and they walked us all that night
until late the next afternoon


820
00:53:51.024 --> 00:53:52.108
with just brief stops.

821
00:53:57.072 --> 00:53:59.282
At Spremberg, they put us on a train.

822
00:53:59.282 --> 00:54:01.785
We were locked inside of these boxcars.

823
00:54:01.785 --> 00:54:04.371
They jammed in 60 to 70 men.

824
00:54:04.371 --> 00:54:06.122
Didn't have room enough to sit down.

825
00:54:06.122 --> 00:54:07.499
It was hell.

826
00:54:08.208 --> 00:54:10.710
That one,
we were packed in tighter than heck.


827
00:54:10.710 --> 00:54:13.713
Anybody falling down would get stomped on.

828
00:54:13.713 --> 00:54:14.965
When the train pulled in,

829
00:54:14.965 --> 00:54:17.592
men were banging on the door
to get out of the cars.


830
00:54:17.592 --> 00:54:19.803
The guards finally opened the doors.

831
00:54:20.428 --> 00:54:22.597
It's as bad as you can imagine.

832
00:54:27.894 --> 00:54:31.189
It was a camp
that apparently had been designed


833
00:54:31.189 --> 00:54:34.568
to hold 8,000 or 10,000 people max.

834
00:54:34.568 --> 00:54:36.987
There was over 100,000 there.

835
00:54:36.987 --> 00:54:38.863
Camp Hell would be
a good word for it.

836
00:54:40.782 --> 00:54:43.076
There were no barracks,
people camped outside.


837
00:54:43.076 --> 00:54:44.536
The conditions were horrible.

838
00:54:44.536 --> 00:54:46.288
No one knew what
was gonna happen to them.

839
00:54:49.791 --> 00:54:52.335
One day,
we were walking around in the camp.


840
00:54:52.335 --> 00:54:55.463
Somebody says,
"There's a tank. There's a Sherman tank."


841
00:54:55.463 --> 00:54:57.215
And then we looked and, surely enough,

842
00:54:57.215 --> 00:54:59.676
there was a Sherman tank on the horizon.

843
00:55:00.677 --> 00:55:02.804
Patton's Third Army came through.

844
00:55:02.804 --> 00:55:07.642
I saw Patton on a tank when he came
through the main gate of Stalag VII-A.


845
00:55:07.642 --> 00:55:08.727
We'd been liberated.

846
00:55:10.979 --> 00:55:15.984
The men went to the flagpole
and rung down the swastika


847
00:55:15.984 --> 00:55:21.197
while they opened up Old Glory
and raised it, and we came to attention.


848
00:55:21.197 --> 00:55:24.284
We weren't in uniforms.
Tattered clothes and all that stuff.


849
00:55:24.284 --> 00:55:26.953
And I guess that was the greatest salute
I ever gave.


850
00:55:29.873 --> 00:55:31.708
It was very emotional.

851
00:55:31.708 --> 00:55:33.793
We were finally going to be freed

852
00:55:33.793 --> 00:55:38.673
after all those months and years
of having been held as POWs.


853
00:55:38.673 --> 00:55:42.677
In many ways, it was hard to believe that
we were finally gonna be able to go home.


854
00:55:43.803 --> 00:55:45.972
<i>This is London Calling.</i>

855
00:55:45.972 --> 00:55:48.016
<i>Here is a news flash.</i>

856
00:55:48.516 --> 00:55:53.313
<i>The German radio has just announced
that Hitler is dead.</i>


857
00:55:55.273 --> 00:56:00.153
<i>On May 1st, 1945, the day
the world learned of Hitler's suicide,</i>


858
00:56:00.153 --> 00:56:02.489
<i>the 100th flew one final mission,</i>

859
00:56:02.489 --> 00:56:05.533
<i>part of what was called
Operation Chowhound.</i>


860
00:56:05.533 --> 00:56:09.788
<i>The crews would be dropping,
by parachute, food, not bombs.</i>


861
00:56:09.788 --> 00:56:12.999
<i>Relief for nearly five million
starving people in the Netherlands,</i>


862
00:56:12.999 --> 00:56:15.752
<i>still occupied by die-hard Nazis.</i>

863
00:56:16.253 --> 00:56:19.631
<i>As the bombers reached
the outskirts of Amsterdam,</i>


864
00:56:19.631 --> 00:56:23.843
<i>they passed over fields
of brilliantly colored tulips.</i>


865
00:56:23.843 --> 00:56:25.512
<i>In one of them,
the heads of the flowers</i>

866
00:56:25.512 --> 00:56:29.432
<i>had been clipped to say,
"Many thanks, Yanks."</i>


867
00:56:37.857 --> 00:56:39.693
<i>The war in Europe was over.</i>

868
00:56:39.693 --> 00:56:43.071
<i>The crews of the 100th
packed up their duffels,</i>


869
00:56:43.071 --> 00:56:46.116
<i>and the local folk
from the villages around Thorpe Abbotts,</i>


870
00:56:46.116 --> 00:56:48.285
<i>dressed in their Sunday finest,</i>

871
00:56:48.285 --> 00:56:51.663
<i>gathered to see them off
for their long journey home.</i>


872
00:57:00.130 --> 00:57:02.591
When I got to Atlanta,
I went to the public telephone


873
00:57:02.591 --> 00:57:05.719
and called my mother
and told 'em I was home.


874
00:57:06.261 --> 00:57:07.888
Course, she immediately broke down,

875
00:57:09.556 --> 00:57:11.224
and they came out--

876
00:57:11.224 --> 00:57:15.812
They drove out to Fort McPherson,
and they picked me up and I got home.


877
00:57:18.481 --> 00:57:20.108
We got back to California.

878
00:57:20.108 --> 00:57:22.027
My dad and mother were there.

879
00:57:22.027 --> 00:57:25.739
There was a big reunion, of course,
and I was halfway to the moon.


880
00:57:26.865 --> 00:57:30.327
And then I saw my wife-to-be, Barbara.

881
00:57:30.327 --> 00:57:33.121
And three weeks later, we were married.

882
00:57:34.831 --> 00:57:38.001
<i>The men of the Bloody Hundredth
were finally home,</i>


883
00:57:38.877 --> 00:57:41.129
<i>reunited with their families</i>

884
00:57:41.796 --> 00:57:43.173
<i>and their wives</i>

885
00:57:44.049 --> 00:57:45.717
<i>and their sweethearts.</i>

886
00:57:46.218 --> 00:57:49.763
<i>Some for the first time
since leaving for war.</i>


887
00:57:50.805 --> 00:57:54.851
When I left the service, 
I was exhausted.

888
00:57:54.851 --> 00:57:57.229
I'd been through these trying experiences,

889
00:57:57.229 --> 00:58:00.815
and I wanted to put that behind me
and I wanted to resume civilian life.


890
00:58:02.025 --> 00:58:05.695
I went back to work
at the same firm that I had been with,


891
00:58:05.695 --> 00:58:09.241
and I was not ready, really,
to go back to work.


892
00:58:09.241 --> 00:58:12.702
And finally,
after being there for six months,


893
00:58:12.702 --> 00:58:18.166
I heard about an opportunity
to go to Nuremberg as a prosecutor.


894
00:58:20.627 --> 00:58:23.588
On the ship over there,
I met this beautiful woman


895
00:58:23.588 --> 00:58:27.592
who was also a lawyer
and was going over as a prosecutor.


896
00:58:27.592 --> 00:58:31.221
And within 10 days,
we were engaged to marry,


897
00:58:31.763 --> 00:58:33.765
and we were married over in Nuremberg.

898
00:58:35.600 --> 00:58:40.480
I saw these defendants there
who were powerless now,


899
00:58:40.480 --> 00:58:44.192
sitting abjectly
and being tried and being convicted.


900
00:58:44.734 --> 00:58:48.822
And when I saw that,
that, in fact, ended the war for me.


901
00:58:53.910 --> 00:58:57.497
<i>World War II was the most
devastating event in human history.</i>


902
00:58:58.707 --> 00:59:02.168
<i>More costly in lives
than any war ever fought.</i>


903
00:59:03.169 --> 00:59:08.174
<i>In it, the Eighth Air Force
suffered the highest casualty rate</i>


904
00:59:08.174 --> 00:59:11.219
<i>of any of the American Armed Forces.</i>

905
00:59:14.347 --> 00:59:16.808
Now that I've survived it

906
00:59:16.808 --> 00:59:22.397
and can look back on it
for all these intervening years,


907
00:59:23.356 --> 00:59:25.567
it was a life changer for me.

908
00:59:27.068 --> 00:59:28.361
If, in this time,

909
00:59:28.361 --> 00:59:32.532
there's a feeling of excitement
and romance and mythology, it's there.


910
00:59:32.532 --> 00:59:37.037
My friends that I made then
saved my life any number of times.


911
00:59:37.037 --> 00:59:40.123
They were the friends of all friends.

912
00:59:40.707 --> 00:59:43.627
The people we served with,
they were dedicated,


913
00:59:43.627 --> 00:59:46.630
they sacrificed, they had great courage.

914
00:59:47.172 --> 00:59:50.091
We shared heartbreak and hilarity.

915
00:59:50.091 --> 00:59:54.554
We saw our comrades go down
and being killed,


916
00:59:54.554 --> 00:59:57.891
being wounded, become prisoners of war.

917
00:59:57.891 --> 01:00:02.938
And we developed a tremendous respect
for each other and we shared a victory.


918
01:00:03.438 --> 01:00:07.234
And I think this was
the experience of all of our people.


919
01:00:07.234 --> 01:00:09.945
Miraculously, people came together.

920
01:00:12.739 --> 01:00:16.284
You have to give all the credit
to the men and the women


921
01:00:16.284 --> 01:00:21.289
that sacrificed their lives and basically
saved the world from fascism.


922
01:00:23.792 --> 01:00:28.421
The freedoms that we enjoy
did not come about by accident.


923
01:00:28.421 --> 01:00:32.092
They were bought and paid for
by my generation


924
01:00:32.092 --> 01:00:35.345
and the generations that preceded us.

925
01:00:35.345 --> 01:00:36.763
And for that reason,

926
01:00:36.763 --> 01:00:42.644
I think the World War II generation
deserves to be remembered.
