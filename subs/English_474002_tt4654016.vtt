Allie.

10
00:01:07.416 --> 00:01:09.039
- No one likes my poetry.

11
00:01:09.073 --> 00:01:10.557
- Here's a good one for you,
Bernard.


12
00:01:10.592 --> 00:01:11.696
Name's Irene.

13
00:01:13.353 --> 00:01:14.354
I don't read poetry.

14
00:01:14.389 --> 00:01:15.493
- You read Bukowski.

15
00:01:15.528 --> 00:01:17.219
- He's an icon.

16
00:01:17.254 --> 00:01:19.980
- I hate the name Irene.

17
00:01:20.015 --> 00:01:21.637
I hate everything about my life.

18
00:01:21.672 --> 00:01:23.087
I'm not progressing.

19
00:01:23.122 --> 00:01:25.745
Where am I gonna be in,
in 25 years?


20
00:01:25.779 --> 00:01:26.815
- Dead.

21
00:01:26.849 --> 00:01:27.678
- At 49?

22
00:01:29.645 --> 00:01:30.715
I don't even exist now.

23
00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.166
How can I be dead at 49?

24
00:01:33.201 --> 00:01:35.479
I'll be a failure because no one
wants me.


25
00:01:35.513 --> 00:01:36.859
- We'll all be dead, man.

26
00:01:36.894 --> 00:01:37.929
- Jesus, you're depressing.

27
00:01:37.964 --> 00:01:39.241
- Nuclear winter, man.

28
00:01:39.276 --> 00:01:40.380
- I'm not political.

29
00:01:40.415 --> 00:01:42.555
- It's outta your hands.

30
00:01:42.589 --> 00:01:44.936
- Don't you want to do
anything with your life, Huey?


31
00:01:44.971 --> 00:01:46.110
- Until the bomb?

32
00:01:46.145 --> 00:01:47.353
Get laid.

33
00:01:47.387 --> 00:01:48.664
- Is that it?

34
00:01:48.699 --> 00:01:50.252
- Is that bad?

35
00:01:50.287 --> 00:01:51.598
Do you get laid?

36
00:01:51.633 --> 00:01:52.461
- I think that I...

37
00:01:52.496 --> 00:01:55.292
I am waiting to fall
in love first.


38
00:01:55.326 --> 00:01:57.017
So who's this Irene?

39
00:01:58.571 --> 00:01:59.365
- Student.

40
00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:00.607
Overachiever.

41
00:02:00.642 --> 00:02:02.782
But in a good way.

42
00:02:02.816 --> 00:02:06.061
- Why did you write
"loose cannon?"


43
00:02:06.096 --> 00:02:07.131
- Yeah.

44
00:02:07.166 --> 00:02:08.477
You'll find out.

00:02:25.218 --> 00:02:26.323
- You know what I miss?

48
00:02:26.357 --> 00:02:27.669
Is the '80s chick.

49
00:02:27.703 --> 00:02:28.980
A certain kind.

50
00:02:30.189 --> 00:02:31.949
Radical in the streets.

51
00:02:31.983 --> 00:02:33.640
Experimental in bed.

52
00:02:34.814 --> 00:02:38.956
So feminist she'd fuck anybody
[chuckles]


53
00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:41.234
and she didn't care for me any
more for me


54
00:02:41.269 --> 00:02:42.960
than I care for her.

55
00:02:43.995 --> 00:02:45.204
The '80s chick.

56
00:02:47.067 --> 00:02:48.517
Mmmm.

57
00:02:48.552 --> 00:02:49.794
- You're a pig.

58
00:02:51.244 --> 00:02:53.971
- My ex-wife, Suzanne,
she was compassionate,


59
00:02:54.005 --> 00:02:55.041
but not really.

60
00:02:55.075 --> 00:02:57.285
Like she was compassionate
to a point.


61
00:02:57.319 --> 00:02:58.665
Pseudo-compassionate.

62
00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:00.978
I mean, what I mean to say is,
my ex-wife


63
00:03:01.012 --> 00:03:03.325
was compassionate when
it suited her purposes.


64
00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:06.363
More a tactic than an ethic.

65
00:03:08.296 --> 00:03:11.471
My ex-wife's compassion
had an agenda.


66
00:03:13.266 --> 00:03:17.960
But I don't need to tell you,
compassion is superficial.


67
00:03:20.929 --> 00:03:21.757
Cheryl?

68
00:03:23.449 --> 00:03:24.795
- Hi.

69
00:03:24.829 --> 00:03:25.934
Adorable man.

70
00:03:33.217 --> 00:03:34.253
- I hate you.

71
00:03:35.461 --> 00:03:38.740
[phone ringing]

72
00:03:38.774 --> 00:03:40.500
[sighs]

73
00:03:40.535 --> 00:03:41.363
Yeah.

74
00:03:42.295 --> 00:03:43.123
Yeah, I got him.

75
00:03:43.158 --> 00:03:45.195
I told you I would.

76
00:03:45.229 --> 00:03:46.196
The fuck kinda question is that?

77
00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:49.475
He looks fat, and bald,
and sweaty.


78
00:03:49.509 --> 00:03:50.303
[groaning]

79
00:03:50.338 --> 00:03:51.684
Hey-hey-hey-hey!

80
00:03:52.926 --> 00:03:54.480
Hey, get back!

81
00:03:54.514 --> 00:03:56.930
Get back here,
you son of a bitch!


82
00:03:56.965 --> 00:03:57.862
You fucker.

83
00:04:02.695 --> 00:04:04.662
- So, I will call you tomorrow.

84
00:04:04.697 --> 00:04:06.250
Actually, tomorrow is
a busy day.


85
00:04:06.285 --> 00:04:07.389
- I don't pick up,
so I'll call you.


86
00:04:07.424 --> 00:04:09.115
- I'm actually gonna be
out of the office all week,


87
00:04:09.149 --> 00:04:12.601
so I tell you what,
why don't I text you?


88
00:04:12.636 --> 00:04:13.430
I'll text you.

89
00:04:13.464 --> 00:04:14.810
- I'll text you.

00:04:21.921 --> 00:04:23.923
[sighs]

91
00:04:26.305 --> 00:04:27.133
- Dammit.

92
00:04:28.238 --> 00:04:30.343
I start doing something
with this place tomorrow.


93
00:04:30.378 --> 00:04:33.381
I start doing something
with this place tomorrow.


94
00:04:33.415 --> 00:04:36.211
[knocking]

95
00:04:36.246 --> 00:04:37.074
Hmmm.

96
00:04:38.144 --> 00:04:40.974
She must have
forgotten something.


97
00:04:42.044 --> 00:04:44.599
Or maybe she loves me.

98
00:04:44.633 --> 00:04:47.084
[chuckles]

99
00:04:47.118 --> 00:04:48.982
- Every 25 years, right?

100
00:04:49.017 --> 00:04:50.432
I drop in, right?

101
00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:53.780
- Uh...

102
00:04:53.815 --> 00:04:54.609
- What are you staring at?

103
00:04:54.643 --> 00:04:55.886
- I'm...

104
00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:56.990
- Why are you standing there
with your finger up your ass?


105
00:04:57.025 --> 00:04:58.613
- Sorry, I think you
have the wrong apartment.


106
00:04:58.647 --> 00:04:59.579
- Oh, shit!

107
00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:04.584
You don't fuckin' know who I am.

108
00:05:04.619 --> 00:05:05.758
- Okay, look, I, I don't...

109
00:05:05.792 --> 00:05:09.486
- I can't fucking believe
this one, Bernard!


110
00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:12.178
I shouldn't fuckin' know you!

111
00:05:12.212 --> 00:05:14.870
That is the kind of
friends we were.


112
00:05:14.905 --> 00:05:16.493
If anybody's gonna
forget somebody


113
00:05:16.527 --> 00:05:20.462
in this fucking friendship,
it's me, you, all right?


114
00:05:20.497 --> 00:05:21.325
- Wait.

115
00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:22.153
Huey?

116
00:05:22.188 --> 00:05:23.258
Huey!

117
00:05:23.293 --> 00:05:24.121
- Yeah!

118
00:05:26.296 --> 00:05:27.504
- What's going on?

119
00:05:27.538 --> 00:05:28.677
You've changed.

120
00:05:28.712 --> 00:05:30.230
Not in a mean way.

121
00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:32.543
- It's good to see you!

122
00:05:32.578 --> 00:05:33.579
- It's good to see, oh...

123
00:05:33.613 --> 00:05:34.373
Jesus!

124
00:05:34.407 --> 00:05:35.235
Huey!

125
00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:36.961
- Hey, do you have any
Black Flag?


126
00:05:36.996 --> 00:05:38.687
Circle Jerks?

127
00:05:38.722 --> 00:05:39.654
Minutemen?

128
00:05:39.688 --> 00:05:40.586
Some vinyl.

129
00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:41.345
- No, I know what you're
talking about.


130
00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:42.277
No, I do not.

131
00:05:42.312 --> 00:05:43.968
- Y'know, you still have
your cassettes?


132
00:05:44.003 --> 00:05:45.487
'Cause those are comin'
back, haven't you heard?


133
00:05:45.522 --> 00:05:46.350
- No, I don't have cassettes.

134
00:05:46.385 --> 00:05:47.731
Huey, I don't even have a bed!

135
00:05:47.765 --> 00:05:48.594
Not for you.

136
00:05:48.628 --> 00:05:49.698
I just have one.

137
00:05:49.733 --> 00:05:50.561
And I...

138
00:05:52.632 --> 00:05:53.426
- Shit.

139
00:05:53.461 --> 00:05:54.358
I'll tell you what.

140
00:05:54.393 --> 00:05:55.635
I will...

141
00:05:55.670 --> 00:05:56.464
- Jesus, Huey!

142
00:05:56.498 --> 00:05:57.534
I'll buy a bed!

143
00:05:57.568 --> 00:05:58.362
- What?

144
00:05:58.397 --> 00:05:59.190
No.

145
00:05:59.225 --> 00:06:00.019
No no no.

146
00:06:00.053 --> 00:06:00.916
No.

147
00:06:00.951 --> 00:06:01.676
You don't have to buy
me furniture,


148
00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:04.851
just because I don't have any.

149
00:06:04.886 --> 00:06:05.680
- Oh.

150
00:06:05.714 --> 00:06:07.267
That's no problem.

151
00:06:07.302 --> 00:06:09.028
Did you just move in?

152
00:06:10.616 --> 00:06:11.686
- Five years?

153
00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:14.620
Yeah, it's a...

154
00:06:14.654 --> 00:06:15.621
- What?

155
00:06:15.655 --> 00:06:18.348
- It's been five years.

156
00:06:18.382 --> 00:06:21.281
But there's a reason for that.

157
00:06:21.316 --> 00:06:23.353
I'm going to get furniture.

158
00:06:23.387 --> 00:06:26.321
- [Bernard] Why do I always end
up with girls who are neurotic?


159
00:06:26.356 --> 00:06:28.116
- Oh, you dig that chick?

160
00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:28.944
- Where?

161
00:06:28.979 --> 00:06:29.876
- Some piece!

162
00:06:29.911 --> 00:06:31.602
She's on a little magazine kick.

163
00:06:31.637 --> 00:06:33.535
- [Bernard] Y'know, in the
beginning, they seem so normal.


164
00:06:33.570 --> 00:06:34.502
- Who?

165
00:06:34.536 --> 00:06:35.779
- The girls I go out with!

166
00:06:35.813 --> 00:06:37.574
I never know they're neurotic.

167
00:06:37.608 --> 00:06:38.402
- [Huey] I love it, man!

168
00:06:38.437 --> 00:06:39.369
It kills me!

169
00:06:39.403 --> 00:06:40.508
Hey, baby!

170
00:06:40.542 --> 00:06:42.061
- In the beginning, they
tell me how different I am.


171
00:06:42.095 --> 00:06:45.098
I'm not crude and demanding
like the other men they know.


172
00:06:45.133 --> 00:06:46.306
- I dig the culture, baby.

173
00:06:46.341 --> 00:06:47.860
I dig the scene.

174
00:06:47.894 --> 00:06:49.896
Peace in Central America?

175
00:06:49.931 --> 00:06:53.590
I've got a piece for you
in my Central America.


176
00:06:53.624 --> 00:06:56.696
Smile, you phony little-magazine
tease, smile for Huey.


177
00:06:56.731 --> 00:06:57.559
- Huey!

178
00:06:58.595 --> 00:07:00.493
She's hiding yawns when I'm in
the middle


179
00:07:00.528 --> 00:07:02.909
of talking about my childhood.

180
00:07:02.944 --> 00:07:04.359
Soon, it's all over between us,

181
00:07:04.394 --> 00:07:06.534
with her telling me that it's
her fault.


182
00:07:06.568 --> 00:07:08.398
Like I'm the only boy
she ever respected.


183
00:07:08.432 --> 00:07:11.677
- Shit, look at that
preppie airhead smile.


184
00:07:11.711 --> 00:07:13.264
That skank's too fucking much.

185
00:07:13.299 --> 00:07:14.956
- I've lost a lover.

186
00:07:15.853 --> 00:07:17.372
A potential lover,

187
00:07:18.304 --> 00:07:20.271
and won a friend.

188
00:07:20.306 --> 00:07:21.134
Yay.

189
00:07:22.204 --> 00:07:24.448
Christ, what do I do wrong,
Huey?


190
00:07:24.483 --> 00:07:25.725
- Loan me a five, Bernie.

191
00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:27.106
I got to travel.

192
00:07:28.383 --> 00:07:30.765
- Don't you ever respect girls,
Huey?


193
00:07:30.799 --> 00:07:34.458
- If I had any respect for
chicks, I'd never make out.


194
00:07:34.493 --> 00:07:36.080
Dig it, man!

195
00:07:36.115 --> 00:07:36.943
- Uh...

196
00:07:39.843 --> 00:07:40.671
- Hey.

197
00:07:41.776 --> 00:07:43.260
I'm Huey.

198
00:07:43.294 --> 00:07:44.399
- God!

199
00:07:44.434 --> 00:07:47.506
- Barnard girls, Sarah
Lawrence girls, Radcliffe.


200
00:07:47.540 --> 00:07:50.440
The classier, the more
independent, the more liberated,


201
00:07:50.474 --> 00:07:51.613
the more Jewish.

202
00:07:51.648 --> 00:07:52.959
Oh!

203
00:07:52.994 --> 00:07:54.616
He was my hero, and oh my God,
you should


204
00:07:54.651 --> 00:07:55.652
see him now.

205
00:07:55.686 --> 00:08:00.001
He's fat and bald and
old and really defeated.


206
00:08:00.035 --> 00:08:01.589
Really bad looking.

207
00:08:01.623 --> 00:08:03.487
Really awful looking.

208
00:08:03.522 --> 00:08:05.040
And he once smelled of prowess,

209
00:08:05.075 --> 00:08:07.353
and now he smells like a wino.

210
00:08:07.387 --> 00:08:08.699
And he doesn't have a
place to live,


211
00:08:08.734 --> 00:08:09.735
but he's got a roll of bills

212
00:08:09.769 --> 00:08:11.564
that could get you indicted.

213
00:08:11.599 --> 00:08:12.703
I mean, he's camped
out of my place,


214
00:08:12.738 --> 00:08:13.773
and clearly he needs help,

215
00:08:13.808 --> 00:08:17.743
and I'm just thinking,
you're a shrink, and...


216
00:08:17.777 --> 00:08:18.640
- Oh, no.

217
00:08:18.675 --> 00:08:19.503
- Please.

218
00:08:19.538 --> 00:08:20.504
- No.

219
00:08:20.539 --> 00:08:21.540
No.

220
00:08:21.574 --> 00:08:22.713
- Just talk to him and
give him some advice.


221
00:08:22.748 --> 00:08:23.542
- No.

222
00:08:23.576 --> 00:08:25.405
- He could be a
potential suicide.


223
00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:26.234
- You don't know that.

224
00:08:26.268 --> 00:08:27.235
- We don't not know that,

225
00:08:27.269 --> 00:08:29.168
and I don't want to come
home to a dead body.


226
00:08:29.202 --> 00:08:31.860
I have too much going on.

227
00:08:31.895 --> 00:08:33.310
Just talk to him.

228
00:08:34.138 --> 00:08:36.486
[footsteps]

229
00:08:39.627 --> 00:08:40.731
Really awful looking.

230
00:08:40.766 --> 00:08:42.940
He's aging terribly.

231
00:08:42.975 --> 00:08:45.529
[door opening]

232
00:08:48.877 --> 00:08:49.706
Huey?

233
00:08:51.362 --> 00:08:52.881
Huey?

234
00:08:52.916 --> 00:08:54.400
[snoring]

235
00:08:54.434 --> 00:08:55.953
I guess he's asleep.

236
00:08:55.988 --> 00:08:58.404
- [Roz] He doesn't
sound suicidal.


237
00:08:58.438 --> 00:08:59.474
- [Bernard] Well...

238
00:08:59.509 --> 00:09:00.406
[snores]

239
00:09:00.440 --> 00:09:03.513
In that case, as long as
we're here...


240
00:09:03.547 --> 00:09:04.341
- [Roz] Oh, I see.

241
00:09:04.375 --> 00:09:06.170
The old suicidal-friend gambit.

242
00:09:06.205 --> 00:09:06.999
- What?

243
00:09:07.033 --> 00:09:08.172
No!

244
00:09:08.207 --> 00:09:09.208
Coincidence.

245
00:09:10.692 --> 00:09:11.521
[screaming]

246
00:09:11.555 --> 00:09:12.349
- [Roz] Oh!

247
00:09:12.383 --> 00:09:13.557
Oh, my God!

248
00:09:13.592 --> 00:09:14.420
Oh!

249
00:09:14.454 --> 00:09:16.905
Oh my God, I love that!

250
00:09:16.940 --> 00:09:18.355
Yes!

251
00:09:18.389 --> 00:09:19.667
Yes!

252
00:09:19.701 --> 00:09:20.633
Oh!

253
00:09:20.668 --> 00:09:22.670
Oh, you do that so well!

254
00:09:24.499 --> 00:09:25.327
Oh.

255
00:09:26.881 --> 00:09:29.297
- You gotta be kiddin' me.

256
00:09:29.331 --> 00:09:30.505
- [Roz] Yes!

257
00:09:33.853 --> 00:09:35.752
What about your friend?

258
00:09:35.786 --> 00:09:37.512
- [Bernard] It's probably
best not to wake him, I guess.


259
00:09:37.547 --> 00:09:38.927
In his condition.

260
00:09:39.928 --> 00:09:40.791
- [Roz] Right.

261
00:09:40.826 --> 00:09:41.620
- [Bernard] I'm serious.

262
00:09:41.654 --> 00:09:42.759
I don't know.

263
00:09:42.793 --> 00:09:45.485
Looks like he's still breathing.

264
00:09:57.981 --> 00:10:00.535
[phone beeping]

265
00:10:00.570 --> 00:10:02.019
[water running]

266
00:10:02.054 --> 00:10:04.712
[phone ringing]

267
00:10:18.657 --> 00:10:19.519
- Hello?

268
00:10:23.454 --> 00:10:24.455
- He's gone!

269
00:10:26.768 --> 00:10:28.839
[sighs]

270
00:10:28.874 --> 00:10:31.221
[whistling]

271
00:10:41.507 --> 00:10:42.819
- [Huey] Hey!

272
00:10:42.853 --> 00:10:44.199
- [Bernard] Hey!

273
00:10:45.545 --> 00:10:47.927
Where did this stuff come from?

274
00:10:47.962 --> 00:10:49.722
- Some dude down the street.

275
00:10:49.757 --> 00:10:50.585
Will you pour the wine?

276
00:10:50.620 --> 00:10:51.413
- [Bernard] What?

277
00:10:51.448 --> 00:10:52.242
Oh, Huey, I don't...

278
00:10:52.276 --> 00:10:53.519
- [Huey] Hey, uh, so last night.

279
00:10:53.553 --> 00:10:56.246
What, uh, what was goin'
on up there?


280
00:10:56.280 --> 00:10:57.454
You never made out!

281
00:10:57.488 --> 00:10:58.351
- What?

282
00:10:58.386 --> 00:10:59.214
That's not true!

283
00:10:59.249 --> 00:11:00.975
- Don't tell me.

284
00:11:01.009 --> 00:11:02.632
I made the scene, you
never made the scene.


285
00:11:02.666 --> 00:11:03.460
- I made the scene.

286
00:11:03.494 --> 00:11:04.703
- You were scene-adjacent.

287
00:11:04.737 --> 00:11:06.083
Now, you're pinning
more tail than a donkey


288
00:11:06.118 --> 00:11:08.568
at a kid's birthday party.

289
00:11:08.603 --> 00:11:10.985
- [Bernard] Thank you.

290
00:11:11.019 --> 00:11:12.814
- I'm duly impressed.

291
00:11:12.849 --> 00:11:13.677
I'm confounded.

292
00:11:13.712 --> 00:11:15.023
- It's not implausible.

293
00:11:15.058 --> 00:11:17.336
- It's improbable.

294
00:11:17.370 --> 00:11:21.271
I don't know whether to
shit or go blind.


295
00:11:21.305 --> 00:11:23.238
It was beautiful, man.

296
00:11:23.273 --> 00:11:25.309
I mean, I'd never seen anything
like it.


297
00:11:25.344 --> 00:11:27.518
What this chick accomplished
is like the Versailles


298
00:11:27.553 --> 00:11:29.313
of greeting cards.

299
00:11:29.348 --> 00:11:30.176
Angie.

300
00:11:31.453 --> 00:11:32.938
Village chick.

301
00:11:32.972 --> 00:11:35.216
Oh, my God, the curves.

302
00:11:35.250 --> 00:11:36.389
Oh...

303
00:11:36.424 --> 00:11:39.151
But a Matisse when it came
to fucking greeting cards.


304
00:11:39.185 --> 00:11:39.979
But who wants 'em?

305
00:11:40.014 --> 00:11:41.015
Nobody.

306
00:11:41.049 --> 00:11:43.258
So, no, my family's in
the printing trades.


307
00:11:43.293 --> 00:11:45.364
My brother Marty runs the
business, right?


308
00:11:45.398 --> 00:11:46.434
- I didn't know that.

309
00:11:46.468 --> 00:11:47.262
- Oh, yeah.

310
00:11:47.297 --> 00:11:48.125
I grew up in the
printing trades.


311
00:11:48.160 --> 00:11:49.092
You never met Marty?

312
00:11:49.126 --> 00:11:49.989
- [Bernard] No.

313
00:11:50.024 --> 00:11:50.749
- Oh, he's the brains
of the operation


314
00:11:50.783 --> 00:11:52.164
really hard worker.

315
00:11:52.198 --> 00:11:54.166
- No, wait, your wife
designed the greeting cards?


316
00:11:54.200 --> 00:11:55.339
- Well, the wife shit
came later.


317
00:11:55.374 --> 00:11:56.962
First came the success shit.

318
00:11:56.996 --> 00:11:58.342
Like Bombshell City.

319
00:11:58.377 --> 00:11:59.550
Like what's happening.

320
00:11:59.585 --> 00:12:01.138
How fast can you count?

321
00:12:01.173 --> 00:12:04.107
She makes 'em, I print
'em, and it's, like,


322
00:12:04.141 --> 00:12:05.211
six-figure heaven.

323
00:12:05.246 --> 00:12:06.903
I'm talking zillionaire time.

324
00:12:06.937 --> 00:12:08.525
Stamford, Connecticut, time.

325
00:12:08.559 --> 00:12:09.699
150 employees.

326
00:12:10.561 --> 00:12:11.562
Expansion.

327
00:12:11.597 --> 00:12:12.598
Refinancing.

328
00:12:12.632 --> 00:12:14.151
Rolling over of moneys.

329
00:12:14.186 --> 00:12:15.843
- I have to say, in all
the years I knew you,


330
00:12:15.877 --> 00:12:19.778
I never thought of you
working for a living.


331
00:12:19.812 --> 00:12:21.296
- Style!

332
00:12:21.331 --> 00:12:22.435
The scene is what?

333
00:12:22.470 --> 00:12:24.575
I won't lie, Fortune 500.

334
00:12:26.025 --> 00:12:27.199
And then what?

335
00:12:29.304 --> 00:12:31.548
I mean, her midlife crisis.

336
00:12:32.445 --> 00:12:33.343
I'm cool.

337
00:12:33.377 --> 00:12:35.138
But after 10 years of marriage,

338
00:12:35.172 --> 00:12:37.347
she objects to me
fucking around?


339
00:12:37.381 --> 00:12:39.004
Then she storms out on me?

340
00:12:39.038 --> 00:12:41.247
Talk about a violation
of the wedding vows.


341
00:12:41.282 --> 00:12:43.077
- Huey, I mean, technically,
you were the first


342
00:12:43.111 --> 00:12:45.355
to violate the wedding vows.

343
00:12:45.389 --> 00:12:47.564
♪ She was a teenage debutante

344
00:12:47.598 --> 00:12:50.463
♪ A George F. 
Will sycophant

345
00:12:50.498 --> 00:12:51.706
- Ahhhhh!

346
00:12:51.741 --> 00:12:53.328
- Jeez!

347
00:12:53.363 --> 00:12:54.364
- Punk rock!

348
00:12:56.366 --> 00:12:59.162
I will take the leather
jacket and sweaters now.


349
00:12:59.196 --> 00:13:00.888
When will the suits be ready?

350
00:13:00.922 --> 00:13:01.958
- [Clerk] 10 days, sir.

351
00:13:01.992 --> 00:13:03.200
How would you like to
pay for this?


352
00:13:03.235 --> 00:13:04.339
Cash or credit?

353
00:13:04.374 --> 00:13:05.893
- Cash.

354
00:13:05.927 --> 00:13:06.790
- [Clerk] Great.

355
00:13:06.825 --> 00:13:09.689
Where would you like it
delivered to?


356
00:13:09.724 --> 00:13:10.932
- 360...

357
00:13:10.967 --> 00:13:12.554
- 370.

358
00:13:12.589 --> 00:13:13.659
West 11th.

359
00:13:13.693 --> 00:13:14.764
- 12th.

360
00:13:14.798 --> 00:13:16.110
- Apartment 4...

361
00:13:17.076 --> 00:13:17.870
- N.

362
00:13:17.905 --> 00:13:18.768
- N, N.

363
00:13:20.079 --> 00:13:22.910
It's on the north side
of the building.


364
00:13:22.944 --> 00:13:25.188
A lot of light in the morning.

365
00:13:25.222 --> 00:13:26.568
And there are no curtains.

366
00:13:26.603 --> 00:13:27.431
- Nope.

367
00:13:29.468 --> 00:13:31.781
- You're insulting my work?

368
00:13:31.815 --> 00:13:33.644
You just couldn't stand to
give me anything, right?


369
00:13:33.679 --> 00:13:34.645
- You lost him!

370
00:13:34.680 --> 00:13:35.474
- What am I?

371
00:13:35.508 --> 00:13:36.613
In the CIA or something?

372
00:13:36.647 --> 00:13:37.441
It's not my responsibility!

373
00:13:37.476 --> 00:13:38.408
I did what I could!

374
00:13:38.442 --> 00:13:39.478
- And then you lost him in New
York City?


375
00:13:39.512 --> 00:13:41.066
- And, of course, you
have to insult my art,


376
00:13:41.100 --> 00:13:42.308
because it just about
keeping me down below you.


377
00:13:42.343 --> 00:13:43.585
- Of course I have to insult
your art.


378
00:13:43.620 --> 00:13:44.828
You won't get out of
this penis phase, baby!


379
00:13:44.863 --> 00:13:47.797
- So what is the deal with all
the cash?


380
00:13:47.831 --> 00:13:49.039
- Just business.

381
00:13:49.074 --> 00:13:49.868
- Okay.

382
00:13:49.902 --> 00:13:51.110
And what is business?

383
00:13:51.145 --> 00:13:53.803
It's kinda like a new retail.

384
00:13:53.837 --> 00:13:54.804
- New retail?

385
00:13:54.838 --> 00:13:55.770
Be more specific.

386
00:13:55.805 --> 00:13:59.360
I'm just curious what you
do for a living.


387
00:13:59.394 --> 00:14:00.154
- Um...

388
00:14:00.188 --> 00:14:01.811
- What?

389
00:14:01.845 --> 00:14:04.917
- Capture an old fat man that
left us...


390
00:14:04.952 --> 00:14:06.056
- Let's go the other way.

391
00:14:06.091 --> 00:14:06.885
- Why?

392
00:14:06.919 --> 00:14:08.438
What are you...

393
00:14:08.472 --> 00:14:09.266
Wait.

394
00:14:09.301 --> 00:14:10.336
Are you on the lam?

395
00:14:10.371 --> 00:14:11.475
Is that what's happening?

396
00:14:11.510 --> 00:14:12.752
- Define lam.

397
00:14:12.787 --> 00:14:14.306
- Why should...

398
00:14:14.340 --> 00:14:16.515
You know what I mean.

399
00:14:16.549 --> 00:14:17.343
- You're absurd!

400
00:14:17.378 --> 00:14:18.482
- It's your father...

401
00:14:18.517 --> 00:14:20.174
- What do you care about
some old sweaty misogynist?


402
00:14:20.208 --> 00:14:21.175
- I should never have
trusted you with this.


403
00:14:21.209 --> 00:14:22.348
You never do anything right.

404
00:14:22.383 --> 00:14:23.384
- Yes, you're right.

405
00:14:23.418 --> 00:14:24.764
You should have hired
a private investigator


406
00:14:24.799 --> 00:14:26.974
instead of your child,
and then made her feel


407
00:14:27.008 --> 00:14:29.597
like an idiot for telling
the truth in her art.


408
00:14:29.631 --> 00:14:30.425
- Yes.

409
00:14:30.460 --> 00:14:32.462
Yes, I should have.

410
00:14:32.496 --> 00:14:34.705
- I would lead with John Irving.

411
00:14:34.740 --> 00:14:35.810
Milan Kundera.

412
00:14:35.845 --> 00:14:37.432
Gabriel Garcia Marquez.

413
00:14:37.467 --> 00:14:38.778
Fucking far out.

414
00:14:38.813 --> 00:14:41.160
Tom Stoppard was hip city.

415
00:14:41.195 --> 00:14:42.713
August Wilson.

416
00:14:42.748 --> 00:14:44.060
Tony Kushner.

417
00:14:44.094 --> 00:14:46.372
I would talk
Existentialism to hipsters.


418
00:14:46.407 --> 00:14:47.201
- I know.

419
00:14:47.235 --> 00:14:48.029
You act like I wasn't there.

420
00:14:48.064 --> 00:14:49.893
- Well, I never paid.

421
00:14:49.928 --> 00:14:51.136
Chicks always paid.

422
00:14:51.170 --> 00:14:52.240
Didn't need money.

423
00:14:52.275 --> 00:14:53.724
- Huey, I get it.

424
00:14:53.759 --> 00:14:55.140
What's the problem?

425
00:14:55.174 --> 00:14:56.072
[sighs]

426
00:14:56.106 --> 00:14:58.591
- I haven't read a book
in 15 years.


427
00:14:58.626 --> 00:14:59.869
- That doesn't mean
that you can't...


428
00:14:59.903 --> 00:15:00.697
- [Woman] Bad boy!

429
00:15:00.731 --> 00:15:02.216
- Oh, hey!

430
00:15:02.250 --> 00:15:03.803
- Now I've found you!

431
00:15:03.838 --> 00:15:05.012
- Yes, Huey, this is Stephanie.

432
00:15:05.046 --> 00:15:06.116
- And Flo and Samantha.

433
00:15:06.151 --> 00:15:06.945
- Hi.

434
00:15:06.979 --> 00:15:07.842
- We just flew in from L.A.

435
00:15:07.877 --> 00:15:08.670
- Nice to meet you.

436
00:15:08.705 --> 00:15:09.533
- My God, I need a drink.

437
00:15:09.568 --> 00:15:10.362
- Let's do that.

438
00:15:10.396 --> 00:15:11.811
I can take care of that.

439
00:15:11.846 --> 00:15:12.640
- Let's go!

440
00:15:12.674 --> 00:15:15.229
- No, I don't go there anymore.

441
00:15:15.263 --> 00:15:17.334
- Oh, God, I miss London.

442
00:15:18.611 --> 00:15:19.612
- The Brits.

443
00:15:19.647 --> 00:15:20.855
- But for me, you know,
that's the bottom line.


444
00:15:20.890 --> 00:15:22.753
I won't go anywhere they bust
you for bringing in drugs.


445
00:15:22.788 --> 00:15:24.479
It's a matter of principle,
right?


446
00:15:24.514 --> 00:15:26.274
I mean, so what does
your friend do?


447
00:15:26.309 --> 00:15:27.103
- I don't know.

448
00:15:27.137 --> 00:15:27.931
Why don't you ask him?

449
00:15:27.966 --> 00:15:29.174
- You brought him, you ask him.

450
00:15:29.208 --> 00:15:31.314
- It's easier to kick
drugs than booze.


451
00:15:31.348 --> 00:15:32.694
- I think that's generational.

452
00:15:32.729 --> 00:15:33.523
How old are you?

453
00:15:33.557 --> 00:15:34.351
- How old are you?

454
00:15:34.386 --> 00:15:35.180
- Huey!

455
00:15:35.214 --> 00:15:36.008
- [Samantha] Bangkok is ruined.

456
00:15:36.043 --> 00:15:36.871
- [Flo] Ruined!

457
00:15:36.906 --> 00:15:37.699
- And Vietnam is ruined.

458
00:15:37.734 --> 00:15:38.908
- Ruined!

459
00:15:38.942 --> 00:15:40.840
- I mean, they get ruined
because they to Westernize.


460
00:15:40.875 --> 00:15:41.669
I mean, wherever you
have capitalism,


461
00:15:41.703 --> 00:15:42.877
you have Westernization,

462
00:15:42.912 --> 00:15:44.879
but without capitalism,
there's no prosperity.


463
00:15:44.914 --> 00:15:45.811
So then the people don't eat.

464
00:15:45.845 --> 00:15:46.950
And of course people
have to eat...


465
00:15:46.985 --> 00:15:47.813
Gotta eat...

466
00:15:47.847 --> 00:15:48.952
So then they have to Westernize.

467
00:15:48.987 --> 00:15:50.333
It's a tragic dilemma.

468
00:15:50.367 --> 00:15:51.161
- Tragic.

469
00:15:51.196 --> 00:15:52.128
- Do they let you
bring in drugs?


470
00:15:52.162 --> 00:15:53.439
- Okay, I know you're
gonna laugh,


471
00:15:53.474 --> 00:15:55.062
but I still like St. Barts.

472
00:15:55.096 --> 00:15:55.994
- Yes.

473
00:15:56.028 --> 00:15:57.581
The people of St. Barts
are the nicest.


474
00:15:57.616 --> 00:15:58.410
- Oh, St. Barts is ruined.

475
00:15:58.444 --> 00:15:59.238
- What?

476
00:15:59.273 --> 00:16:00.515
- St. Thomas is nicer, I think.

477
00:16:00.550 --> 00:16:01.482
- [Samantha] I don't want to
upset anyone, but we're talking


478
00:16:01.516 --> 00:16:03.139
about a colonial culture here,
and I feel


479
00:16:03.173 --> 00:16:05.279
very uncomfortable in a
colonial culture.


480
00:16:05.313 --> 00:16:06.521
- The Virgin Islands
isn't colonial!


481
00:16:06.556 --> 00:16:07.591
- Well, post-colonial.

482
00:16:07.626 --> 00:16:09.628
- What does that even
mean, "post-colonial"?


483
00:16:09.662 --> 00:16:10.732
- Here's what we're gonna do.

484
00:16:10.767 --> 00:16:13.528
Why don't we go and travel
together, and we'll see


485
00:16:13.563 --> 00:16:14.357
which is the nicest?

486
00:16:14.391 --> 00:16:15.185
St. Barts?

487
00:16:15.220 --> 00:16:16.014
St. Thomas?

488
00:16:16.048 --> 00:16:20.052
[crosstalk drowns out dialogue]

489
00:16:21.881 --> 00:16:23.055
- Nice.

490
00:16:23.090 --> 00:16:28.095
Nice is overrated, and the
only island I dig is New York,


491
00:16:28.612 --> 00:16:31.236
because it is no-frills mean.

492
00:16:31.270 --> 00:16:32.754
Maybe you're having dinner,
you ask for


493
00:16:32.789 --> 00:16:35.550
a little water, your waitress,
six times,


494
00:16:35.585 --> 00:16:37.863
finally, you order a vodka
with water,


495
00:16:37.897 --> 00:16:39.037
and maybe if you're lucky,

496
00:16:39.071 --> 00:16:41.453
you'll see her next Tuesday.

497
00:16:41.487 --> 00:16:43.075
The meanest salespeople
in the world?


498
00:16:43.110 --> 00:16:44.145
New York City.

499
00:16:44.180 --> 00:16:45.043
Help you?

500
00:16:45.077 --> 00:16:47.114
They'd rather have their tongues
cut out.


501
00:16:47.148 --> 00:16:48.115
- Jesus.

502
00:16:48.149 --> 00:16:51.359
- Mean queers define
the meaning of meanness.


503
00:16:51.394 --> 00:16:53.465
Top in Pops, mean queers.

504
00:16:55.053 --> 00:16:57.400
Mean queers as sales personnel?

505
00:16:57.434 --> 00:17:01.231
That is hands-down,
state-of-the-art meanness.


506
00:17:03.061 --> 00:17:05.373
Meanness of a higher sphere.

507
00:17:07.099 --> 00:17:08.756
- Do you really believe
this shit,


508
00:17:08.790 --> 00:17:10.792
or are you just talking?

509
00:17:11.862 --> 00:17:16.281
- Why don't we go to
your place and find out?


510
00:17:16.315 --> 00:17:18.835
- Do me a favor, will you?

511
00:17:18.869 --> 00:17:20.216
Disappear.

512
00:17:20.250 --> 00:17:22.045
Come on, girls.

513
00:17:22.080 --> 00:17:24.530
- I apologize for Huey...

514
00:17:24.565 --> 00:17:25.359
- Enough.

515
00:17:25.393 --> 00:17:26.187
Bye.

516
00:17:26.222 --> 00:17:27.050
Sorry.

517
00:17:27.085 --> 00:17:27.913
Flo.

518
00:17:29.880 --> 00:17:30.709
- What?

519
00:17:31.951 --> 00:17:33.436
- You are unbelievable.

520
00:17:33.470 --> 00:17:34.816
No, seriously, seriously, Huey?

521
00:17:34.851 --> 00:17:36.094
Why even speak?

522
00:17:36.991 --> 00:17:39.062
Hey, Roz, where are you?

523
00:17:39.097 --> 00:17:40.788
- It had to be said.

524
00:17:41.858 --> 00:17:42.652
Nice.

525
00:17:46.104 --> 00:17:47.553
- Isn't this amazing?

526
00:17:47.588 --> 00:17:48.416
- Mm-hmm.

527
00:17:50.211 --> 00:17:53.352
- On a scale of one to

528
00:17:53.387 --> 00:17:54.974
- Um...

529
00:17:55.009 --> 00:17:55.803
Amazing?

530
00:17:55.837 --> 00:17:56.631
- Yeah!

531
00:17:56.666 --> 00:17:57.494
Okay.

532
00:17:58.426 --> 00:18:01.947
[moaning and laughing]

533
00:18:01.981 --> 00:18:03.328
Oh, Roz!

534
00:18:03.362 --> 00:18:04.191
Yeah!

535
00:18:04.225 --> 00:18:05.468
Yeah, Yeah!

536
00:18:05.502 --> 00:18:06.607
Oh Roz!

537
00:18:06.641 --> 00:18:07.608
Yeah!

538
00:18:07.642 --> 00:18:09.092
Yeah!

539
00:18:09.127 --> 00:18:10.507
Say my name.

540
00:18:10.542 --> 00:18:11.336
Say my name.

541
00:18:11.370 --> 00:18:12.268
- Yes, Bernard.

542
00:18:12.302 --> 00:18:13.096
Bernard!

543
00:18:13.131 --> 00:18:13.959
- [Bernard] Oh Roz!

544
00:18:13.993 --> 00:18:15.409
Woo, hoo, hoo!

545
00:18:15.443 --> 00:18:18.688
[laughing and moaning]

546
00:18:19.689 --> 00:18:22.450
[moaning loudly]

547
00:18:23.693 --> 00:18:26.351
[phone beeping]

548
00:18:36.154 --> 00:18:38.432
[laughing]

549
00:18:43.126 --> 00:18:45.266
- [Zelda] Hey, what am I
doing here?


550
00:18:45.301 --> 00:18:47.199
- This whole thing
was your idea.


551
00:18:47.234 --> 00:18:48.994
If it wasn't for you,
I'd be drunk in Denver.


552
00:18:49.028 --> 00:18:51.030
- It was Mom's idea,
and second of all,


553
00:18:51.065 --> 00:18:54.448
I didn't find you in Denver,
I found you in Aspen.


554
00:18:54.482 --> 00:18:56.139
What the fuck were you
doing in Aspen?


555
00:18:56.174 --> 00:18:57.278
- How should I know?

556
00:18:57.313 --> 00:18:59.591
I bought a pot farm in Colorado.

557
00:18:59.625 --> 00:19:01.420
Aspen's in Colorado.

558
00:19:01.455 --> 00:19:02.594
- Thank you.

559
00:19:02.628 --> 00:19:04.354
- So, you livin' with some dude?

560
00:19:04.389 --> 00:19:05.390
- [Zelda] Drop dead!

561
00:19:05.424 --> 00:19:06.839
[chuckles]

562
00:19:06.874 --> 00:19:08.979
- If you think hating me's
gonna get on my nerves,


563
00:19:09.014 --> 00:19:10.567
don't give it a thought.

564
00:19:10.602 --> 00:19:12.121
- I don't even know you, man.

565
00:19:12.155 --> 00:19:13.467
- Yes, you do.

566
00:19:13.501 --> 00:19:15.434
Like it or not,
you're part of me.


567
00:19:15.469 --> 00:19:16.608
- [Zelda] Oh, God.

568
00:19:16.642 --> 00:19:17.540
- So, yes or no?

569
00:19:17.574 --> 00:19:18.782
Boyfriend?

570
00:19:18.817 --> 00:19:20.508
You're not married, are you?

571
00:19:20.543 --> 00:19:21.820
How old are you?

572
00:19:21.854 --> 00:19:23.684
- You don't even know
how old I am?


573
00:19:23.718 --> 00:19:25.548
- I'm not great with details,
okay?


574
00:19:25.582 --> 00:19:27.757
But before I left, I
was a very good father.


575
00:19:27.791 --> 00:19:29.552
Did your mother tell you that?

576
00:19:29.586 --> 00:19:30.898
- It must have slipped her mind.

577
00:19:30.932 --> 00:19:31.899
- Do you like your name?

578
00:19:31.933 --> 00:19:32.727
- Why?

579
00:19:32.762 --> 00:19:34.004
Was it your idea?

580
00:19:34.039 --> 00:19:36.386
- As a matter of fact.

581
00:19:36.421 --> 00:19:38.733
Your mother wanted to
name you Virginia,


582
00:19:38.768 --> 00:19:40.632
after Virginia Woolf.

583
00:19:40.666 --> 00:19:42.116
I said, well, if we're
going to name her after


584
00:19:42.151 --> 00:19:45.154
a crazy female writer,
dig this, let's name


585
00:19:45.188 --> 00:19:47.949
her after an American crazy
female writer.


586
00:19:47.984 --> 00:19:49.882
Thus, Zelda Fitzgerald.

587
00:19:51.884 --> 00:19:53.438
- Is that supposed
to be endearing?


588
00:19:53.472 --> 00:19:56.165
- Why, I think it has
a great pedigree.


589
00:19:56.199 --> 00:19:57.614
Y'know, people say she
was the brains behind


590
00:19:57.649 --> 00:20:00.307
the operation with old F. Scott.

591
00:20:01.170 --> 00:20:04.103
Sadly, she was a bit
schizophrenic.


592
00:20:05.243 --> 00:20:06.968
Spent years in the sanatorium.

593
00:20:07.003 --> 00:20:08.832
- It seems I'm headed for the
same fate.


594
00:20:08.867 --> 00:20:09.661
- Well, I hope not.

595
00:20:09.695 --> 00:20:10.834
She died in a fire.

596
00:20:10.869 --> 00:20:12.008
- I'd be open to that if it
would get me


597
00:20:12.042 --> 00:20:14.044
out of here any quicker.

598
00:20:14.079 --> 00:20:16.081
- When is your mother
getting here?


599
00:20:16.115 --> 00:20:18.152
- [Zelda] Not soon enough.

600
00:20:18.187 --> 00:20:19.533
- My ex-wife, Suzanne.

601
00:20:19.567 --> 00:20:20.430
- Suzanne.

602
00:20:20.465 --> 00:20:21.224
- She didn't know me the way you
know me,


603
00:20:21.259 --> 00:20:23.157
so why did I marry her?

604
00:20:23.192 --> 00:20:24.469
It wasn't her fault.

605
00:20:24.503 --> 00:20:25.297
Y'know what?

606
00:20:25.332 --> 00:20:26.229
Yeah, it was.

607
00:20:26.264 --> 00:20:27.817
No, not really.

608
00:20:27.851 --> 00:20:29.370
I wasn't there for her to know.

609
00:20:29.405 --> 00:20:32.028
I only let her know
parts of myself,


610
00:20:32.062 --> 00:20:33.236
don't ask me why.

611
00:20:33.271 --> 00:20:34.444
- Fear of commitment.

612
00:20:34.479 --> 00:20:35.549
- No, that wasn't it.

613
00:20:35.583 --> 00:20:38.724
It just seemed too much
of an effort.


614
00:20:38.759 --> 00:20:40.830
So when we split up, she
wasn't splitting up with me.


615
00:20:40.864 --> 00:20:43.660
She was splitting up with
this fragment, this segment.


616
00:20:43.695 --> 00:20:45.973
So the loss I felt was
no more or less a loss


617
00:20:46.007 --> 00:20:48.009
than say, my little toe.

618
00:20:49.287 --> 00:20:51.565
[chuckles]

619
00:20:53.256 --> 00:20:56.397
Losing my wife was like
losing my little toe.


620
00:20:56.432 --> 00:20:58.399
[laughs]

621
00:20:58.434 --> 00:21:00.263
The shit I say to you.

622
00:21:01.609 --> 00:21:02.679
I wonder why.

623
00:21:08.444 --> 00:21:10.031
Are you staying up?

624
00:21:10.066 --> 00:21:11.136
- I think so.

625
00:21:12.482 --> 00:21:13.932
- Hm.

626
00:21:13.966 --> 00:21:14.795
All right.

627
00:21:23.148 --> 00:21:24.563
- [Aggie] It's so bizarre!

628
00:21:24.598 --> 00:21:25.530
The cards that I think are gonna
do well


629
00:21:25.564 --> 00:21:26.772
just die on me,

630
00:21:26.807 --> 00:21:28.671
and the cards that I do just
for the hell of it, like...


631
00:21:28.705 --> 00:21:31.156
Zelda, what was that card, two
years ago,


632
00:21:31.190 --> 00:21:34.297
you remember, it was so bizarre

633
00:21:34.332 --> 00:21:36.851
it sold hundreds of thousands?

634
00:21:40.061 --> 00:21:40.855
- I dunno.

635
00:21:40.890 --> 00:21:43.444
Could it have been about a cat?

636
00:21:44.342 --> 00:21:46.654
No, Zelda, cats always sell.

637
00:21:48.587 --> 00:21:50.451
Cats sell better than
almost anything.


638
00:21:50.486 --> 00:21:52.281
It's just not a challenge
to do a cat card.


639
00:21:52.315 --> 00:21:54.697
Anyone that does a cat card,
even not very good one,


640
00:21:54.731 --> 00:21:56.112
they sell millions.

641
00:21:56.146 --> 00:21:56.975
You know what I call it?

642
00:21:57.009 --> 00:21:59.909
I call it "catsism,"
like "sexism."


643
00:22:01.013 --> 00:22:03.361
Oh, I am so bored of cats.

644
00:22:03.395 --> 00:22:05.639
But, I just cannot, for
the life of me recall


645
00:22:05.673 --> 00:22:07.503
the what, that card...

646
00:22:10.782 --> 00:22:11.921
A baby!

647
00:22:11.955 --> 00:22:13.854
[laughs]

648
00:22:13.888 --> 00:22:15.545
How bizarre!

649
00:22:15.580 --> 00:22:18.065
An ugly, little wrinkled baby.

650
00:22:18.099 --> 00:22:19.584
That was the card!

651
00:22:20.895 --> 00:22:22.241
Oh, no.

652
00:22:22.276 --> 00:22:25.728
Huey, do you know that
your daughter has the


653
00:22:25.762 --> 00:22:29.007
makings of a truly
brilliant cartoonist?


654
00:22:29.041 --> 00:22:30.388
- Graphic novelist!

655
00:22:30.422 --> 00:22:31.596
Please!

656
00:22:31.630 --> 00:22:34.081
- You been published.

657
00:22:34.115 --> 00:22:35.220
- Nothing long-form.

658
00:22:35.254 --> 00:22:36.083
Yet!

659
00:22:37.326 --> 00:22:38.672
- Then you're still a
cartoonist, dear.


660
00:22:38.706 --> 00:22:39.776
- Oh, Christ!

661
00:22:39.811 --> 00:22:40.812
I can't do this anymore!

662
00:22:40.846 --> 00:22:42.607
What are you doing?

663
00:22:42.641 --> 00:22:43.435
Look at you!

664
00:22:43.470 --> 00:22:44.540
Look at him!

665
00:22:44.574 --> 00:22:46.714
You're acting like a, like a,

666
00:22:46.749 --> 00:22:48.198
like a damsel in distress

667
00:22:48.233 --> 00:22:51.926
about a fuckin' fat little
fringy man!


668
00:22:51.961 --> 00:22:54.032
I can't, I can't sit
here anymore!


669
00:22:54.066 --> 00:22:55.067
It's insane!

670
00:22:59.727 --> 00:23:00.728
- I'm sorry.

671
00:23:03.938 --> 00:23:04.939
- I'm sorry that I drink so much

672
00:23:04.974 --> 00:23:07.356
and I talk so much gibberish.

673
00:23:08.426 --> 00:23:11.670
She is very much her
father's daughter.


674
00:23:13.431 --> 00:23:14.293
- Well.

675
00:23:16.537 --> 00:23:17.366
Thank you.

676
00:23:18.436 --> 00:23:19.264
What is she?

677
00:23:19.298 --> 00:23:20.127
22?

678
00:23:21.991 --> 00:23:22.923
- 25.

679
00:23:22.957 --> 00:23:23.786
- Oh.

680
00:23:24.856 --> 00:23:26.823
She's got balls.

681
00:23:26.858 --> 00:23:28.894
- Well, she's strong,
if that's what you mean.


682
00:23:28.929 --> 00:23:32.760
Oh, Huey, I was out to
make a good impression.


683
00:23:36.315 --> 00:23:39.146
- You know, I've got a
friend in publishing.


684
00:23:39.180 --> 00:23:42.011
- I've got friends
in publishing.


685
00:23:42.045 --> 00:23:45.670
- Well, I'm not making promises,
um...


686
00:23:45.704 --> 00:23:47.154
She's not a dyke?

687
00:23:48.086 --> 00:23:49.536
- No!

688
00:23:49.570 --> 00:23:51.710
What kind of question is that?

689
00:23:51.745 --> 00:23:53.781
- She's ballsy.

690
00:23:53.816 --> 00:23:55.921
What's her deal with men?

691
00:23:57.267 --> 00:24:00.409
- She treats men like
you treat women.


692
00:24:01.410 --> 00:24:03.619
She doesn't have much
faith in men.


693
00:24:03.653 --> 00:24:05.966
And why should she?

694
00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:07.416
- Don't finish it, Aggie.

695
00:24:07.450 --> 00:24:10.729
- Her father left when
she was 10.


696
00:24:10.764 --> 00:24:11.558
I'm sorry.

697
00:24:11.592 --> 00:24:12.455
Don't be mad at me.

698
00:24:12.490 --> 00:24:13.318
Oh...

699
00:24:14.975 --> 00:24:16.286
- Oh, I, no, I'm not...

700
00:24:16.321 --> 00:24:17.149
No, I...

701
00:24:20.187 --> 00:24:23.155
You look great, by the way.

702
00:24:23.190 --> 00:24:24.053
I mean it!

703
00:24:24.087 --> 00:24:26.469
I do, I do, I do, I do.

704
00:24:26.504 --> 00:24:28.506
- As I live and breathe.

705
00:24:30.991 --> 00:24:34.995
- [Huey] I dunno why this
is such a surprise to you.


706
00:24:35.029 --> 00:24:37.963
- Huey, I didn't even
know you had a daughter.


707
00:24:37.998 --> 00:24:39.137
- Well, I have a son, too.
- What?


708
00:24:39.171 --> 00:24:40.932
- But that's a different story.

709
00:24:40.966 --> 00:24:41.967
I mean, I've been with
a lot of women,


710
00:24:42.002 --> 00:24:44.211
and they're not all careful.

711
00:24:44.245 --> 00:24:45.315
- It was their fault?

712
00:24:45.350 --> 00:24:46.144
- No problem.

713
00:24:46.178 --> 00:24:46.972
My fault.

714
00:24:47.007 --> 00:24:48.871
But it's their kid.

715
00:24:48.905 --> 00:24:50.010
- You're a sociopath!

716
00:24:50.044 --> 00:24:51.356
- No!

717
00:24:51.390 --> 00:24:53.910
Hey, uh, maybe you can help
my daughter.


718
00:24:53.945 --> 00:24:55.118
- No, Huey, please.

719
00:24:55.153 --> 00:24:56.982
I'm bad enough with my
own family.


720
00:24:57.017 --> 00:24:59.019
- She's a comic book writer.

721
00:24:59.053 --> 00:24:59.882
What do they call it?

722
00:24:59.916 --> 00:25:00.710
- Graphic novelist?

723
00:25:00.745 --> 00:25:01.539
- Right!

724
00:25:01.573 --> 00:25:02.401
And you're at Norton, dig?

725
00:25:02.436 --> 00:25:03.437
So can't you?

726
00:25:03.472 --> 00:25:04.749
- No, I have nothing to
do with that department.


727
00:25:04.783 --> 00:25:07.199
No, I've got my own problems.

728
00:25:07.234 --> 00:25:09.512
I don't want to help
your daughter.


729
00:25:09.547 --> 00:25:10.686
- Wow!

730
00:25:10.720 --> 00:25:12.688
- I can't decide which one
of you is more narcissistic,


731
00:25:12.722 --> 00:25:15.173
but I've got patients to see.

732
00:25:16.070 --> 00:25:19.971
Why they're not either
one of you, I don't know.


733
00:25:20.005 --> 00:25:21.075
- Bye.
- Bye.


734
00:25:24.493 --> 00:25:25.632
- Hates men.

735
00:25:25.666 --> 00:25:27.219
- [Roz] I can hear you!

736
00:25:27.254 --> 00:25:29.187
- What is your problem?

737
00:25:31.914 --> 00:25:34.882
You know women chew more
gum than men these days.


738
00:25:34.917 --> 00:25:36.366
[gum smacking]

739
00:25:36.401 --> 00:25:37.506
Maybe there's a cartoon in that,

740
00:25:37.540 --> 00:25:39.922
that could be kinda funny,
y'know?


741
00:25:39.956 --> 00:25:41.199
The smart women.

742
00:25:41.233 --> 00:25:42.234
The smartest women I know,

743
00:25:42.269 --> 00:25:43.650
the more they, um...

744
00:25:43.684 --> 00:25:44.582
The more they...

745
00:25:44.616 --> 00:25:45.479
Oh.

746
00:25:48.033 --> 00:25:52.624
Honestly, I don't know
what to say about these.


747
00:25:52.659 --> 00:25:53.487
- [Zelda] Right.

748
00:25:53.522 --> 00:25:54.730
- No, I'm...

749
00:25:54.764 --> 00:25:58.561
I'm not the most
visually-inspired
person in the world.


750
00:25:58.596 --> 00:26:01.081
My opinion, it hardly matters.

751
00:26:01.978 --> 00:26:06.811
I'm only associate publisher
for historical nonfiction.


752
00:26:06.845 --> 00:26:10.918
What I like doesn't count
for a lot around here,


753
00:26:10.953 --> 00:26:12.161
so...

754
00:26:12.195 --> 00:26:13.956
- But you don't like the stuff.

755
00:26:13.990 --> 00:26:14.819
- No, no.

756
00:26:16.855 --> 00:26:18.408
I mean, it's definitely, y'know,

757
00:26:18.443 --> 00:26:19.996
full of bile against men,

758
00:26:20.031 --> 00:26:21.515
not that that's...

759
00:26:21.550 --> 00:26:23.379
That's totally fair commentary.

760
00:26:23.413 --> 00:26:24.898
That's, y'know, yeah...

761
00:26:24.932 --> 00:26:26.796
I mean you have a point of view,
you know,


762
00:26:26.831 --> 00:26:28.971
you definitely have a point of
view, so...


763
00:26:29.005 --> 00:26:32.906
Do you think someone so
young should be doing work


764
00:26:32.940 --> 00:26:34.908
that's this bitter?

765
00:26:34.942 --> 00:26:35.978
- I'm not bitter.

766
00:26:36.012 --> 00:26:37.566
Well, uh...

767
00:26:37.600 --> 00:26:38.877
- You're just afraid.

768
00:26:38.912 --> 00:26:40.258
- Oh?

769
00:26:40.292 --> 00:26:41.259
Is that right?

770
00:26:41.293 --> 00:26:43.157
- That's right.

771
00:26:43.192 --> 00:26:44.814
You're afraid of the truth.

772
00:26:44.849 --> 00:26:46.298
So's everyone else.

773
00:26:46.333 --> 00:26:47.679
That's why I'm not famous.

774
00:26:47.714 --> 00:26:49.163
[gum smacking]

775
00:26:49.198 --> 00:26:53.547
How come someone like you
is friends with my father?


776
00:26:58.207 --> 00:27:00.727
- That's a good question.

777
00:27:00.761 --> 00:27:02.832
Why am I,
at this particular moment,


778
00:27:02.867 --> 00:27:05.628
still friends with your dad?

779
00:27:05.663 --> 00:27:06.560
Oh, here's another one!

780
00:27:06.595 --> 00:27:08.493
Maybe this is, no,
that's more penises.


781
00:27:08.527 --> 00:27:10.253
Yeah, I don't get it.

782
00:27:12.290 --> 00:27:14.326
- What was I supposed to do?

783
00:27:14.361 --> 00:27:16.087
Stay with her mother
after she takes


784
00:27:16.121 --> 00:27:17.502
the greeting-card business
to another printer?


785
00:27:17.536 --> 00:27:19.400
- She was mad at you for
playing around, Huey.


786
00:27:19.435 --> 00:27:21.713
- Yeah, well I made those
fucking cards, all right?


787
00:27:21.748 --> 00:27:24.026
She couldn't sell shit
until I started printing,


788
00:27:24.060 --> 00:27:25.614
promoting, and placing them.

789
00:27:25.648 --> 00:27:28.306
I got her into fucking Wal
-Mart!

790
00:27:28.340 --> 00:27:29.134
Why?

791
00:27:29.169 --> 00:27:30.377
'Cause I love the art.

792
00:27:30.411 --> 00:27:32.034
I mean, I loved her, too!

793
00:27:32.068 --> 00:27:34.001
I busted my balls.

794
00:27:34.036 --> 00:27:35.313
And yeah, I get it!

795
00:27:35.347 --> 00:27:37.660
You know, she finds me in
bed with the cleaning lady.


796
00:27:37.695 --> 00:27:39.800
Okay, fire the fucking
cleaning lady,


797
00:27:39.835 --> 00:27:41.940
you don't fire your
husband's business.


798
00:27:41.975 --> 00:27:43.493
- You had a child!

799
00:27:43.528 --> 00:27:44.460
- Do you have a child?

800
00:27:44.494 --> 00:27:45.634
- You know I don't.

801
00:27:45.668 --> 00:27:49.810
- Don't know nothin', so don't
lecture me.


802
00:27:49.845 --> 00:27:53.676
She humiliated me, and
nobody humiliates Huey.


803
00:27:57.266 --> 00:27:58.094
- All right.

804
00:27:58.129 --> 00:27:59.440
Got it.

805
00:27:59.475 --> 00:28:01.304
- Just don't judge me.

806
00:28:02.616 --> 00:28:03.410
- You know what?

807
00:28:03.444 --> 00:28:04.273
Let's just go home.

808
00:28:04.307 --> 00:28:05.377
- No problem.

809
00:28:08.829 --> 00:28:09.934
- Hey, baby.

810
00:28:09.968 --> 00:28:10.762
- Hey, baby.

811
00:28:10.797 --> 00:28:12.039
You wanna go out, sugar?

812
00:28:12.074 --> 00:28:13.213
- Wanna have a good time?

813
00:28:13.247 --> 00:28:15.042
- Bargain rates tonight, baby.

814
00:28:15.077 --> 00:28:17.044
- Two for one, sugar.

815
00:28:17.079 --> 00:28:18.528
Are you alive, sugar?

816
00:28:18.563 --> 00:28:20.841
I've never paid for it
in my life.


817
00:28:20.876 --> 00:28:21.704
- [Courtesan] Oh.

818
00:28:21.739 --> 00:28:23.395
[laughing]

819
00:28:23.430 --> 00:28:24.362
- No.

820
00:28:24.396 --> 00:28:25.881
Hookers used to give it to me
for free.


821
00:28:25.915 --> 00:28:28.159
- Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.

822
00:28:28.193 --> 00:28:29.160
I don't do free, baby.

823
00:28:29.194 --> 00:28:30.264
Sorry, honey.

824
00:28:31.645 --> 00:28:35.097
- All right, well, I'm
sorry to disappoint you.


825
00:28:35.131 --> 00:28:36.788
I'm , I'm, I'm Huey.

826
00:28:37.996 --> 00:28:38.790
- Who?

827
00:28:38.825 --> 00:28:40.240
- Huey Beauchamp!

828
00:28:41.137 --> 00:28:41.966
- No.

829
00:28:42.898 --> 00:28:45.245
- I am Huey Beauchamp!

830
00:28:45.279 --> 00:28:46.833
[laughing]

831
00:28:46.867 --> 00:28:49.559
I have never paid for it
in my life!


832
00:28:49.594 --> 00:28:50.768
- Are you shittin' me, sugar?

833
00:28:50.802 --> 00:28:51.630
- No.

834
00:28:51.665 --> 00:28:53.702
C'mon, let's go.

835
00:28:53.736 --> 00:28:54.703
Night night.

836
00:28:56.532 --> 00:28:58.568
- [Courtesan] I remember
Huey Beauchamp...


837
00:28:58.603 --> 00:28:59.742
A little tiny boy...

838
00:28:59.777 --> 00:29:00.709
- How much?

839
00:29:01.951 --> 00:29:04.747
[laughing]

840
00:29:04.782 --> 00:29:06.645
- [Courtesan] I like tiny boys.

841
00:29:06.680 --> 00:29:07.543
They don't hurt.

842
00:29:07.577 --> 00:29:10.201
[laughter]

843
00:29:10.235 --> 00:29:11.167
- Let's go.

844
00:29:12.893 --> 00:29:13.722
Let's go.

845
00:29:16.138 --> 00:29:17.760
- They used to give it to me.

846
00:29:17.795 --> 00:29:19.106
- All right.

847
00:29:19.141 --> 00:29:20.729
- I'm not...

848
00:29:20.763 --> 00:29:22.834
That's not even bragging.

849
00:29:22.869 --> 00:29:24.629
That's just true.

850
00:29:24.663 --> 00:29:25.457
- [Bernard] All right.

851
00:29:25.492 --> 00:29:27.528
- [Huey] No problem.

852
00:29:27.563 --> 00:29:28.978
Ahhh.

853
00:29:29.013 --> 00:29:30.186
- Huey, ow!

854
00:29:30.221 --> 00:29:31.774
Ow, you're drunk.

855
00:29:31.809 --> 00:29:32.913
Stop.

856
00:29:32.948 --> 00:29:35.053
You're not getting it
from me for free either.


857
00:29:35.088 --> 00:29:37.366
[laughter]

858
00:29:39.333 --> 00:29:40.990
- You know what we are living
in, man?


859
00:29:41.025 --> 00:29:42.785
The age of the urban chick.

860
00:29:42.820 --> 00:29:43.648
They're hip.

861
00:29:43.682 --> 00:29:44.476
They know it all.

862
00:29:44.511 --> 00:29:45.788
- I feel like a schmuck.

863
00:29:45.823 --> 00:29:48.308
- The urban chick is
trained for combat, man.


864
00:29:48.342 --> 00:29:49.136
- What do I do?

865
00:29:49.171 --> 00:29:50.413
I'm not basically competitive.

866
00:29:50.448 --> 00:29:53.209
- You take the urban chick on
her terms, man, you're dead!


867
00:29:53.244 --> 00:29:54.832
- How many times can I feel like
a schmuck


868
00:29:54.866 --> 00:29:56.799
without also feeling
like a loser?


869
00:29:56.834 --> 00:29:59.008
- There's only one way I
know to get through the armor


870
00:29:59.043 --> 00:30:00.630
of the urban chick.

871
00:30:00.665 --> 00:30:01.459
- How?

872
00:30:01.493 --> 00:30:02.391
How?

873
00:30:02.425 --> 00:30:03.495
- Talk dirty.

874
00:30:04.358 --> 00:30:05.566
- Talk dirty?

875
00:30:05.601 --> 00:30:07.327
- I don't mean
self-conscious dirty,


876
00:30:07.361 --> 00:30:08.811
like it's a current in thing.

877
00:30:08.846 --> 00:30:09.881
She does that herself.

878
00:30:09.916 --> 00:30:11.607
I'm talking animal dirty.

879
00:30:11.641 --> 00:30:14.023
Like you got to make her
believe she's in a jungle


880
00:30:14.058 --> 00:30:17.578
and the rules she learned at
Smith or Barnard don't apply.


881
00:30:17.613 --> 00:30:18.614
Talk dirty?

882
00:30:18.648 --> 00:30:20.961
- You mean, like,
really, like, talk dirty?


883
00:30:20.996 --> 00:30:22.342
- Talk "asshole."

884
00:30:22.376 --> 00:30:23.170
Talk "shit."

885
00:30:23.205 --> 00:30:24.413
Talk "pussy."

886
00:30:24.447 --> 00:30:25.828
Talk "fuck."

887
00:30:25.863 --> 00:30:27.450
Never ask a personal question

888
00:30:27.485 --> 00:30:29.556
and never pick up a check...

889
00:30:29.590 --> 00:30:32.628
To the urban chick, goons
like me are a status symbol.


890
00:30:32.662 --> 00:30:33.663
- This works?

891
00:30:33.698 --> 00:30:34.941
- Works every time.

892
00:30:34.975 --> 00:30:36.632
Put the urban chick on the
defensive, man,


893
00:30:36.666 --> 00:30:38.841
she'll think she's in love.

894
00:30:38.876 --> 00:30:40.084
And with all that armor,

895
00:30:40.118 --> 00:30:43.777
how's she gonna
know the difference?


896
00:30:43.812 --> 00:30:46.745
- I didn't even know
Huey had children.


897
00:30:46.780 --> 00:30:48.437
A daughter, that is.

898
00:30:49.679 --> 00:30:52.924
What's it like to see him
for the first time in, what?


899
00:30:52.959 --> 00:30:53.822
15 years?

900
00:30:54.961 --> 00:30:58.861
- I don't really think about
it one way or the other.


901
00:30:58.896 --> 00:31:01.691
- Are you really this tough?

902
00:31:01.726 --> 00:31:03.555
- I mean, my mom wanted
to see him.


903
00:31:03.590 --> 00:31:04.487
You know?

904
00:31:04.522 --> 00:31:06.489
And once she gets an
idea in her head,


905
00:31:06.524 --> 00:31:08.353
it's like a whole thing, so...

906
00:31:08.388 --> 00:31:10.908
Plus, it was a good excuse for
me to kind of travel around,


907
00:31:10.942 --> 00:31:13.324
and go into some cons,
and meet publishers,


908
00:31:13.358 --> 00:31:15.740
show 'em some of my stuff, so...

909
00:31:15.774 --> 00:31:17.604
- How did you even find him?

910
00:31:17.638 --> 00:31:19.951
- I mean, he's fat, and loud,

911
00:31:19.986 --> 00:31:22.712
and slings money
around like crazy,


912
00:31:22.747 --> 00:31:25.198
So it's kind of hard
to miss him.


913
00:31:25.232 --> 00:31:28.580
It's almost as if he wanted to
be found.


914
00:31:29.547 --> 00:31:32.239
Y'know, you're not
macho like him, are you?


915
00:31:32.274 --> 00:31:33.102
- Well...

916
00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:37.210
No one's macho like Huey, so...

917
00:31:37.244 --> 00:31:38.590
- Y'know, most of the
guys I meet,


918
00:31:38.625 --> 00:31:42.871
I kind of bring out the
macho in them, but not you.


919
00:31:44.148 --> 00:31:45.770
- Is that right?

920
00:31:45.804 --> 00:31:48.186
- Yeah, that's right.

921
00:31:48.221 --> 00:31:49.394
- I'm too old.

922
00:31:50.568 --> 00:31:53.571
- I get the feeling you
were never really that way.


923
00:31:53.605 --> 00:31:56.125
What were you like when you were
my age?


924
00:31:56.160 --> 00:31:57.609
- I wasn't very mature.

925
00:31:57.644 --> 00:31:58.472
- Hmmm.

926
00:31:59.439 --> 00:32:01.510
- Late developer, huh?

927
00:32:01.544 --> 00:32:02.338
[sighs]

928
00:32:02.373 --> 00:32:04.030
- [Bernard] If only.

929
00:32:04.962 --> 00:32:07.205
- I was an early developer.

930
00:32:08.482 --> 00:32:12.693
I bet you were some kind
of, like, wimp, huh?


931
00:32:12.728 --> 00:32:14.454
- I was a wimp.

932
00:32:14.488 --> 00:32:16.870
I was a classic wimp.

933
00:32:16.905 --> 00:32:17.698
- [Zelda] Well.

934
00:32:17.733 --> 00:32:19.114
Just goes to show.

935
00:32:19.148 --> 00:32:19.977
- What?

936
00:32:21.219 --> 00:32:24.050
- That there's hope
for wimps yet.


937
00:32:24.947 --> 00:32:25.775
Married?

938
00:32:27.570 --> 00:32:28.951
- Uh, not anymore.

939
00:32:28.986 --> 00:32:30.228
- Hm.

940
00:32:30.263 --> 00:32:32.092
Did you abandon your wife, too?

941
00:32:32.127 --> 00:32:35.406
- We were only married
for six weeks.


942
00:32:35.440 --> 00:32:36.303
- You got kids?

943
00:32:36.338 --> 00:32:37.649
- After six weeks?

944
00:32:37.684 --> 00:32:38.616
No.

945
00:32:38.650 --> 00:32:40.135
- Oh, that's good.

946
00:32:41.170 --> 00:32:43.621
- [Bernard] Why is that good?

947
00:32:47.038 --> 00:32:51.732
- I wouldn't feel right about
it if there were children.


948
00:32:53.113 --> 00:32:55.115
- Feel right about what?

949
00:32:57.946 --> 00:32:59.085
- You tell me.

950
00:33:02.985 --> 00:33:05.229
You're my best friend's
daughter, uh...


951
00:33:05.263 --> 00:33:07.748
- [Zelda] Uh-huh.

952
00:33:07.783 --> 00:33:10.268
- Doesn't that make
you feel awkward?


953
00:33:10.303 --> 00:33:11.131
- Mmmm...

954
00:33:13.478 --> 00:33:14.307
No.

955
00:33:16.378 --> 00:33:17.724
Should we split?

956
00:33:20.485 --> 00:33:21.314
- Uhhh...

957
00:33:23.488 --> 00:33:24.317
Blah...

958
00:33:26.077 --> 00:33:26.905
- C'mon.

959
00:33:31.703 --> 00:33:32.532
Trust me.

960
00:33:35.949 --> 00:33:37.986
We call ourselves the
Katrinka Kollective.


961
00:33:38.020 --> 00:33:39.263
- [Bernard] And who's Katrinka?

962
00:33:39.297 --> 00:33:40.747
- You're old you should know.

963
00:33:40.781 --> 00:33:42.128
Coming through, guys!

964
00:33:42.162 --> 00:33:44.026
- You promised to help me
on my app deadline, Zelda!


965
00:33:44.061 --> 00:33:45.027
- [Zelda] Five minutes, Celia!

966
00:33:45.062 --> 00:33:45.924
- Your ass, Zelda!

967
00:33:45.959 --> 00:33:47.064
And don't use your room, Zelda.

968
00:33:47.098 --> 00:33:48.341
Harry's in there.

969
00:33:48.375 --> 00:33:50.412
- Why can't Harry sleep
in your room, Celia?


970
00:33:50.446 --> 00:33:51.378
- [Celia] Because your room
doesn't get


971
00:33:51.413 --> 00:33:52.207
the Bushwick traffic.

972
00:33:52.241 --> 00:33:53.035
Okay, Zelda?

973
00:33:53.070 --> 00:33:55.072
- Yo, Harry, out!

974
00:33:55.106 --> 00:33:57.108
While we're young, buddy!

975
00:33:57.143 --> 00:33:58.006
Let's go!

976
00:33:59.904 --> 00:34:00.732
All right!

977
00:34:01.664 --> 00:34:02.458
Okay!

978
00:34:02.493 --> 00:34:03.321
All clear!

979
00:34:04.253 --> 00:34:05.082
Bernard!

980
00:34:06.807 --> 00:34:07.739
- Uhhh...

981
00:34:07.774 --> 00:34:08.602
Bye.

982
00:34:17.887 --> 00:34:20.476
[upbeat music]

983
00:34:55.097 --> 00:34:56.926
- This is really good.

984
00:34:58.100 --> 00:34:59.481
Here you go, buddy!

985
00:34:59.515 --> 00:35:00.309
- Awesome!

986
00:35:00.344 --> 00:35:01.690
Thank you.

987
00:35:01.724 --> 00:35:02.518
[laughing]

988
00:35:02.553 --> 00:35:03.347
Thank you for my meal!

989
00:35:03.381 --> 00:35:05.245
- [Zelda] My pleasure.

990
00:35:05.280 --> 00:35:07.868
[upbeat music]

991
00:35:27.750 --> 00:35:28.786
- What's this?

992
00:35:28.820 --> 00:35:30.684
- It's a present.

993
00:35:30.719 --> 00:35:31.789
- Who is she?

994
00:35:31.823 --> 00:35:33.618
- Roz, come on.

995
00:35:33.653 --> 00:35:34.516
No, that's...

996
00:35:34.550 --> 00:35:37.381
It's a tenth
anniversary present.


997
00:35:37.415 --> 00:35:40.867
It's 10 years since we started
breaking up with each other.


998
00:35:40.901 --> 00:35:41.730
Open it.

999
00:35:43.007 --> 00:35:44.250
- I'm sure it's the
perfect gift.


1000
00:35:44.284 --> 00:35:45.113
- Yes.

1001
00:35:45.147 --> 00:35:47.045
- I know it's the perfect gift.

1002
00:35:47.080 --> 00:35:48.944
But, whatever it is,
I don't want to


1003
00:35:48.978 --> 00:35:51.602
get into a fight tonight.

1004
00:35:51.636 --> 00:35:52.603
- Roz.

1005
00:35:52.637 --> 00:35:53.707
It is just a gift.

1006
00:35:53.742 --> 00:35:55.847
- But there is something,

1007
00:35:55.882 --> 00:35:57.504
a favor,

1008
00:35:57.539 --> 00:35:58.988
to make me like you again.

1009
00:35:59.023 --> 00:35:59.851
- What?

1010
00:36:00.783 --> 00:36:02.509
Ah, you like me.

1011
00:36:02.544 --> 00:36:05.202
That's something I never
have worry about ever.


1012
00:36:05.236 --> 00:36:07.894
[chuckles]

1013
00:36:07.928 --> 00:36:10.034
- I don't know Huey.

1014
00:36:10.068 --> 00:36:13.520
Clearly he's not a person that
knows how to ask for help.


1015
00:36:13.555 --> 00:36:15.660
But I just thought it
would mean a lot to him


1016
00:36:15.695 --> 00:36:17.662
if you saw his daughter.

1017
00:36:19.354 --> 00:36:20.182
- Zelda?

1018
00:36:20.217 --> 00:36:22.115
- Yeah, Zelda.

1019
00:36:22.150 --> 00:36:24.773
You know, just give her some
advice on publishing, and...


1020
00:36:24.807 --> 00:36:26.499
- No, no, no, yeah.

1021
00:36:26.533 --> 00:36:27.327
- Something.

1022
00:36:27.362 --> 00:36:28.190
- Yeah.

1023
00:36:28.225 --> 00:36:29.018
- That's not too much, is it?

1024
00:36:29.053 --> 00:36:29.847
- No.

1025
00:36:29.881 --> 00:36:30.675
That's great.

1026
00:36:30.710 --> 00:36:32.194
I will meet Zelda.

1027
00:36:33.920 --> 00:36:34.714
Mmmm.

1028
00:36:34.748 --> 00:36:36.025
- Good.

1029
00:36:36.060 --> 00:36:38.062
And take your gift back.

1030
00:36:39.167 --> 00:36:40.996
- Oh, it's a good one.

1031
00:36:43.067 --> 00:36:45.621
I mean, if you start to depend
on the compassion of others,


1032
00:36:45.656 --> 00:36:46.519
you can get hurt.

1033
00:36:46.553 --> 00:36:47.347
I know that.

1034
00:36:47.382 --> 00:36:48.659
Still...

1035
00:36:48.693 --> 00:36:51.489
If you spend your life
avoiding hurt,


1036
00:36:51.524 --> 00:36:53.526
you spend your life avoiding
life, y'know.


1037
00:36:53.560 --> 00:36:55.044
Hey!

1038
00:36:55.079 --> 00:36:55.873
Oh!

1039
00:36:55.907 --> 00:36:57.599
That's pretty good!

1040
00:36:57.633 --> 00:36:58.427
Huh?

1041
00:36:58.462 --> 00:36:59.946
I just made that up.

1042
00:36:59.980 --> 00:37:00.947
Huh?

1043
00:37:00.981 --> 00:37:03.156
Doesn't that sound like
something I've said


1044
00:37:03.191 --> 00:37:05.123
a million times before?

1045
00:37:05.986 --> 00:37:07.402
No, I just, uh...

1046
00:37:10.612 --> 00:37:12.407
You inspired that, Zelda.

1047
00:37:12.441 --> 00:37:16.065
No, it's true, it's true,
it's true.


1048
00:37:16.100 --> 00:37:17.860
This whole evening...

1049
00:37:19.276 --> 00:37:20.656
If I was with someone without
your appeal,


1050
00:37:20.691 --> 00:37:24.867
I don't think I could have
come up with that line.


1051
00:37:25.834 --> 00:37:29.217
Because, you know, usually
when I'm with a girl...


1052
00:37:29.251 --> 00:37:31.391
A woman, at least of late,

1053
00:37:32.565 --> 00:37:35.464
I don't get that sense of,
what the hell.


1054
00:37:35.499 --> 00:37:37.708
What the hell, just go for it.

1055
00:37:37.742 --> 00:37:39.434
But I get that with you.

1056
00:37:39.468 --> 00:37:41.643
[kissing]

1057
00:37:42.678 --> 00:37:46.095
- [Zelda] So, are you
currently involved?


1058
00:37:46.130 --> 00:37:48.477
[Laughs]

1059
00:37:48.512 --> 00:37:49.306
- No.

1060
00:37:49.340 --> 00:37:50.168
- What are you laughing at?

1061
00:37:50.203 --> 00:37:50.997
- Involved?

1062
00:37:51.031 --> 00:37:51.860
No.

1063
00:37:51.894 --> 00:37:52.757
- What, I thought that was,
like,


1064
00:37:52.792 --> 00:37:55.415
one of your old man
nonfiction words.


1065
00:37:55.450 --> 00:37:56.278
Old man?

1066
00:37:56.313 --> 00:37:57.106
No.

1067
00:37:57.141 --> 00:37:57.935
[laughter]

1068
00:37:57.969 --> 00:37:58.832
Yes, that's my word.

1069
00:37:58.867 --> 00:37:59.937
- [Zelda] What about
"committed?"


1070
00:37:59.971 --> 00:38:02.595
Are you, uh, committed
to anyone at this moment?


1071
00:38:02.629 --> 00:38:03.803
- No.

1072
00:38:03.837 --> 00:38:04.666
Mm
-Mmm.

1073
00:38:05.529 --> 00:38:06.599
- Hmm.
- Hmm.


1074
00:38:06.633 --> 00:38:07.738
- Hmm.
- Hmm.


1075
00:38:08.670 --> 00:38:11.224
- I mean, what about
our communication?


1076
00:38:11.259 --> 00:38:12.915
Do you think we'll still
be able to communicate,


1077
00:38:12.950 --> 00:38:15.297
given our age difference?

1078
00:38:15.332 --> 00:38:16.505
- Yeah.

1079
00:38:16.540 --> 00:38:19.957
Yeah, we can, we can
talk about books, hmm?


1080
00:38:19.991 --> 00:38:20.785
- What's a book again?

1081
00:38:20.820 --> 00:38:22.304
[laughter]

1082
00:38:22.339 --> 00:38:23.201
- Okay, there you go.

1083
00:38:23.236 --> 00:38:24.272
I'll introduce it to you.

1084
00:38:24.306 --> 00:38:26.757
That'll be a good conversation
to have.


1085
00:38:26.791 --> 00:38:28.483
- Man, I bet I know
what you love.


1086
00:38:28.517 --> 00:38:29.449
- Hmm.

1087
00:38:29.484 --> 00:38:32.245
- I bet you love rock 'n' roll,
baby.


1088
00:38:32.280 --> 00:38:33.073
- Ow!

1089
00:38:33.108 --> 00:38:34.937
- I bet it's really your style.

1090
00:38:34.972 --> 00:38:36.767
- Yes, you know me
so well already.


1091
00:38:36.801 --> 00:38:39.701
Rock 'n' roll and books,
that's me.


1092
00:38:41.358 --> 00:38:42.290
- You know, I think one day,

1093
00:38:42.324 --> 00:38:45.879
I'm actually really gonna
surprise you.


1094
00:38:45.914 --> 00:38:47.812
- You already are surprising me.

1095
00:38:47.847 --> 00:38:50.436
- No, I mean it, Bernie.

1096
00:38:50.470 --> 00:38:53.197
I wanna be a great
graphic novelist.


1097
00:38:53.231 --> 00:38:55.337
I'm gonna be famous.

1098
00:38:55.372 --> 00:38:58.685
I feel like I'm gonna be
the voice of my generation.


1099
00:38:58.720 --> 00:39:00.894
- I know you will be, hmm?

1100
00:39:02.344 --> 00:39:03.483
- No, not her.

1101
00:39:04.415 --> 00:39:08.039
Not Maxine, not Debbie,
not Danielle, no...


1102
00:39:08.074 --> 00:39:09.109
- No?

1103
00:39:09.144 --> 00:39:10.214
- Here's a possibility.

1104
00:39:10.248 --> 00:39:11.042
- Who?

1105
00:39:11.077 --> 00:39:11.871
- Her name's Audrey.

1106
00:39:11.905 --> 00:39:12.699
Built like a brick shithouse.

1107
00:39:12.734 --> 00:39:13.528
Lives in the Bronx.

1108
00:39:13.562 --> 00:39:14.356
- What?

1109
00:39:14.391 --> 00:39:15.219
The Bronx!

1110
00:39:15.253 --> 00:39:17.152
Don't you have anything
in the City?


1111
00:39:17.186 --> 00:39:18.360
- [Huey] Jezebel.

1112
00:39:18.395 --> 00:39:19.775
- Okay.

1113
00:39:19.810 --> 00:39:20.673
- [Huey] Not for you.

1114
00:39:20.707 --> 00:39:21.743
- Now, wait, no, no.

1115
00:39:21.777 --> 00:39:22.847
Who is Jezebel?

1116
00:39:22.882 --> 00:39:24.401
- She'd destroy you, Bernard.

1117
00:39:24.435 --> 00:39:25.263
- Great.

1118
00:39:25.298 --> 00:39:26.057
Great.

1119
00:39:26.092 --> 00:39:26.886
Give me Jezebel!

1120
00:39:26.920 --> 00:39:27.714
The real stuff.

1121
00:39:27.749 --> 00:39:28.543
A dancer.

1122
00:39:28.577 --> 00:39:29.371
- What kind of dancer?

1123
00:39:29.406 --> 00:39:30.234
- Modern.

1124
00:39:30.268 --> 00:39:31.062
- Sounds limber.

1125
00:39:31.097 --> 00:39:31.891
- Lives in the Village.

1126
00:39:31.925 --> 00:39:32.719
Call her now.

1127
00:39:32.754 --> 00:39:33.548
- Now?

1128
00:39:33.582 --> 00:39:36.344
But, it's after midnight, Huey.

1129
00:39:36.378 --> 00:39:39.243
- To Jezebel, man,
it's only lunchtime.


1130
00:39:39.277 --> 00:39:41.107
- Oh, hello, Jezebel.

1131
00:39:41.141 --> 00:39:42.591
Uh, my name is
Bernard Mergendeiler.


1132
00:39:42.626 --> 00:39:45.249
A friend of mine, Huey
Beauchamp, gave me your number


1133
00:39:45.283 --> 00:39:48.114
because he thought that you and
I might...


1134
00:39:48.148 --> 00:39:51.738
No, yes, yeah, no, he, he's
fine, uh, but,


1135
00:39:51.773 --> 00:39:53.395
Huey thought that, uh, it'd be
good if you


1136
00:39:53.430 --> 00:39:54.396
and I could...

1137
00:39:54.431 --> 00:39:58.504
No, I'm sorry, I don't
have his new number,


1138
00:39:58.538 --> 00:40:01.369
but what I do have
are two tickets


1139
00:40:01.403 --> 00:40:05.062
to the Tom Waits concert
on Monday.


1140
00:40:05.096 --> 00:40:06.857
No, Huey will not be there.

1141
00:40:06.891 --> 00:40:09.273
He's out of town, I think.

1142
00:40:09.307 --> 00:40:10.826
So...

1143
00:40:10.861 --> 00:40:13.450
Jezebel, Jezebel, on Tuesday...

1144
00:40:14.589 --> 00:40:15.935
Tuesday night...

1145
00:40:15.969 --> 00:40:20.457
I was invited to a Robert
Mapplethorpe opening...


1146
00:40:20.491 --> 00:40:22.493
Oh, oh, okay...

1147
00:40:22.528 --> 00:40:24.771
Um, are you free Wednesday?

1148
00:40:26.359 --> 00:40:28.119
There's a new French
film screening.


1149
00:40:28.154 --> 00:40:29.224
It's "Shoah."

1150
00:40:30.467 --> 00:40:32.572
I don't know anything about it,
but, uh,


1151
00:40:32.607 --> 00:40:35.161
sounds like a musical.

1152
00:40:35.195 --> 00:40:36.196
Uh, you're free!

1153
00:40:36.231 --> 00:40:37.439
Uh, great.

1154
00:40:37.474 --> 00:40:38.267
10 pm.

1155
00:40:38.302 --> 00:40:39.441
Cinema Studio.

1156
00:40:39.476 --> 00:40:41.512
Yeah, I'll meet you out front.

1157
00:40:41.547 --> 00:40:42.893
I will be the one
carrying a copy


1158
00:40:42.927 --> 00:40:45.378
of "Lady Chatterley's Lover."

1159
00:40:46.793 --> 00:40:48.416
You know, actually I just
started it, but,


1160
00:40:48.450 --> 00:40:51.315
um, I'm really so far
enjoying the whole...


1161
00:40:51.349 --> 00:40:52.143
Oh.

1162
00:40:52.178 --> 00:40:52.972
No, sure.

1163
00:40:53.006 --> 00:40:53.800
No, of course.

1164
00:40:53.835 --> 00:40:54.629
Great.

1165
00:40:54.663 --> 00:40:55.457
Fine.

1166
00:40:55.492 --> 00:40:56.354
Fine.

1167
00:41:00.220 --> 00:41:01.359
Hey, man.

1168
00:41:01.394 --> 00:41:04.155
I'm totally gonna stick it to
that skank.


1169
00:41:04.190 --> 00:41:06.226
- I dig it, man.

1170
00:41:06.261 --> 00:41:07.918
- I think I do, too.

1171
00:41:09.264 --> 00:41:10.576
- [Bernard] Roz, just, c'mon
Roz!


1172
00:41:10.610 --> 00:41:11.749
- No, just get out of here...

1173
00:41:11.784 --> 00:41:12.578
Get out!

1174
00:41:12.612 --> 00:41:13.717
- Roz, let me explain!

1175
00:41:13.751 --> 00:41:15.408
- Oh, you've come here
to tell me you're in love


1176
00:41:15.443 --> 00:41:18.238
with a 25-year-old
underground cartoonist?


1177
00:41:18.273 --> 00:41:19.101
- Graphic novelist.

1178
00:41:19.136 --> 00:41:20.758
And no, I don't know
what it is yet.


1179
00:41:20.793 --> 00:41:21.690
- It's the fucking present!

1180
00:41:21.725 --> 00:41:22.519
- What?

1181
00:41:22.553 --> 00:41:23.381
Ow!

1182
00:41:23.416 --> 00:41:24.210
The present you gave me!

1183
00:41:24.244 --> 00:41:25.211
You always give me presents!

1184
00:41:25.245 --> 00:41:26.039
- Ow!

1185
00:41:26.074 --> 00:41:27.178
Roz! Roz! Roz!

1186
00:41:27.213 --> 00:41:29.008
Look, I'm not any more
happy about it than you are!


1187
00:41:29.042 --> 00:41:30.078
- Oh, you think I'm stupid?

1188
00:41:30.112 --> 00:41:30.906
- No...

1189
00:41:30.941 --> 00:41:31.735
- You want my understanding?

1190
00:41:31.769 --> 00:41:33.081
You want my compassion?

1191
00:41:33.115 --> 00:41:34.358
- No, I, you're a therapist.

1192
00:41:34.392 --> 00:41:35.808
- You're a prick!

1193
00:41:38.431 --> 00:41:39.674
- You know, you were the
one who asked me to meet her


1194
00:41:39.708 --> 00:41:41.641
in the first place!

1195
00:41:41.676 --> 00:41:44.437
[dramatic music]

1196
00:41:45.680 --> 00:41:46.957
- [Zelda] We never go
to your place?


1197
00:41:46.991 --> 00:41:47.785
- [Bernard] No,
I'm just embarrassed


1198
00:41:47.820 --> 00:41:49.960
for you to see my apartment.

1199
00:41:49.994 --> 00:41:51.513
- Because my father lives there!

1200
00:41:51.548 --> 00:41:52.825
- Zelda, I do--

1201
00:41:54.171 --> 00:41:56.173
- If you don't want Huey to
know about us, that's fine.


1202
00:41:56.207 --> 00:41:57.174
You just have to tell me.

1203
00:41:57.208 --> 00:41:58.831
- It's complicated.

1204
00:41:58.865 --> 00:42:01.454
Mainly, it's really
because of my apartment.


1205
00:42:01.489 --> 00:42:02.766
I just don't want you to see it

1206
00:42:02.800 --> 00:42:05.907
until I've had a chance
to do something with it.


1207
00:42:05.941 --> 00:42:09.117
- I don't think you're being
straight with me, Bernard.


1208
00:42:09.151 --> 00:42:10.601
Y'know, it's shaping up like
you're gonna


1209
00:42:10.636 --> 00:42:12.845
have to make a choice.

1210
00:42:12.879 --> 00:42:13.811
Huey or me?

1211
00:42:16.055 --> 00:42:17.090
[door opening]

1212
00:42:17.125 --> 00:42:18.678
- Hey, man!

1213
00:42:18.713 --> 00:42:19.541
- Hey.

1214
00:42:24.512 --> 00:42:25.651
Y'know, I'm...

1215
00:42:26.997 --> 00:42:30.345
I'm kinda surprised
we're still friends.


1216
00:42:31.415 --> 00:42:32.450
You hurt me.

1217
00:42:32.485 --> 00:42:33.417
You know that, right?

1218
00:42:33.451 --> 00:42:34.591
- Bullshit.

1219
00:42:34.625 --> 00:42:35.730
- No, really.

1220
00:42:37.490 --> 00:42:38.560
- That's bullshit, dude,

1221
00:42:38.595 --> 00:42:42.115
practically every girl
you ever had, I gave you.


1222
00:42:42.150 --> 00:42:43.565
- Yeah.

1223
00:42:43.600 --> 00:42:45.774
Do you remember Jezebel?

1224
00:42:45.809 --> 00:42:48.846
- [Huey] I know 17 Jezebels.

1225
00:42:48.881 --> 00:42:50.123
- You see, I still still think
of her,


1226
00:42:50.158 --> 00:42:51.228
and you can't even remember.

1227
00:42:51.262 --> 00:42:53.575
The dancer, Jezebel.

1228
00:42:53.610 --> 00:42:57.061
Huey, she was the girl
of my dreams.


1229
00:42:57.096 --> 00:42:59.167
You know that, right?

1230
00:42:59.201 --> 00:43:00.582
Yeah, no, I,
everything about her,


1231
00:43:00.617 --> 00:43:01.583
the way she looked at me.

1232
00:43:01.618 --> 00:43:03.792
The way she made me feel
smarter than myself.


1233
00:43:03.827 --> 00:43:04.862
Even witty.

1234
00:43:04.897 --> 00:43:08.452
She brought out, she
brought out, like depths,


1235
00:43:08.486 --> 00:43:09.280
that I didn't even...

1236
00:43:09.315 --> 00:43:10.109
Okay, you know what?

1237
00:43:10.143 --> 00:43:10.937
I'm not...

1238
00:43:10.972 --> 00:43:11.766
You're gonna judge me.

1239
00:43:11.800 --> 00:43:13.043
We were inseparable, okay?

1240
00:43:13.077 --> 00:43:14.044
I was addicted to her.

1241
00:43:14.078 --> 00:43:16.633
And then you told me
that I was pussywhipped.


1242
00:43:16.667 --> 00:43:17.841
No, not just,

1243
00:43:17.875 --> 00:43:20.775
you have to know the kind
of influence you had on me.


1244
00:43:20.809 --> 00:43:22.604
That stayed with me, for years.

1245
00:43:22.639 --> 00:43:23.743
Still with me.

1246
00:43:23.778 --> 00:43:27.540
And then, over nothing,
over some dumb issue,


1247
00:43:27.575 --> 00:43:29.266
something that meant
absolutely nothing,


1248
00:43:29.300 --> 00:43:30.267
I stood up to her.

1249
00:43:30.301 --> 00:43:31.095
I mean, I knew,

1250
00:43:31.130 --> 00:43:33.339
I knew I was in the wrong.

1251
00:43:33.373 --> 00:43:36.066
But I didn't want Huey to
think that I was pussywhipped.


1252
00:43:36.100 --> 00:43:37.446
So, we broke up.

1253
00:43:39.656 --> 00:43:40.898
One year later,
she's married to someone


1254
00:43:40.933 --> 00:43:43.763
who looks exactly like me.

1255
00:43:43.798 --> 00:43:45.109
Apparently, they live
in New Jersey.


1256
00:43:45.144 --> 00:43:46.801
They've got three kids,

1257
00:43:46.835 --> 00:43:48.699
and everyone says she
runs the family.


1258
00:43:48.734 --> 00:43:51.599
And all I do some
mornings is hope


1259
00:43:52.738 --> 00:43:54.153
her husband dies.

1260
00:43:55.119 --> 00:43:58.157
- Do you know what you
suffer from, my friend?


1261
00:43:58.191 --> 00:43:59.883
- [Bernard] What?

1262
00:43:59.917 --> 00:44:01.332
- Pussywhip envy.

1263
00:44:03.300 --> 00:44:04.301
- Okay, you know what?

1264
00:44:04.335 --> 00:44:05.164
Don't...

1265
00:44:05.992 --> 00:44:08.477
I'm just saying, Huey, if...

1266
00:44:08.512 --> 00:44:10.169
Just don't...

1267
00:44:10.203 --> 00:44:12.102
Break me up with a woman again.

1268
00:44:12.136 --> 00:44:12.965
Please.

1269
00:44:14.345 --> 00:44:15.174
- Okay.

1270
00:44:16.796 --> 00:44:18.004
Put on your shoes.

1271
00:44:18.039 --> 00:44:19.488
I'll walk you to the subway.

1272
00:44:19.523 --> 00:44:20.835
- Honestly, don't bother.

1273
00:44:20.869 --> 00:44:23.941
Okay, I've never met
anyone so crude in my life.


1274
00:44:23.976 --> 00:44:24.942
- Yeah, crude.

1275
00:44:24.977 --> 00:44:25.978
Now put on your shoes.

1276
00:44:26.012 --> 00:44:27.255
I'll walk you to the subway.

1277
00:44:27.289 --> 00:44:29.084
I mean you want everything
your own way, okay?


1278
00:44:29.119 --> 00:44:30.051
You're spoiled.

1279
00:44:30.085 --> 00:44:31.190
- Yeah, spoiled.

1280
00:44:31.224 --> 00:44:33.019
Now put on your shoes, I'll
walk you to the subway.


1281
00:44:33.054 --> 00:44:34.434
- I mean, I have needs, too,
you know.


1282
00:44:34.469 --> 00:44:36.471
- Yeah, you need to put on
your shoes.


1283
00:44:36.505 --> 00:44:38.335
I'll walk you to the subway.

1284
00:44:38.369 --> 00:44:39.612
- You certainly gave me
a different impression,


1285
00:44:39.647 --> 00:44:40.475
that's all I'm saying.

1286
00:44:40.509 --> 00:44:41.545
I figured, go with the
Columbia guy,


1287
00:44:41.579 --> 00:44:42.373
they're not animals.

1288
00:44:42.408 --> 00:44:43.892
- Now, put on your shoes.

1289
00:44:43.927 --> 00:44:45.618
I'll walk you to the subway.

1290
00:44:45.653 --> 00:44:47.793
- Y'know, there's more to
life than self-gratification.


1291
00:44:47.827 --> 00:44:48.897
- Uh-huh.

1292
00:44:48.932 --> 00:44:50.796
- Okay, I hate to be
pushed into things.


1293
00:44:50.830 --> 00:44:52.418
We've barely said a word
to each other.


1294
00:44:52.452 --> 00:44:54.144
Even though, I admit
entirely too much time


1295
00:44:54.178 --> 00:44:55.421
is spent on talking now-a-days.

1296
00:44:55.455 --> 00:44:57.457
- Okay, you talked.

1297
00:44:57.492 --> 00:44:58.700
Now put on your shoes.

1298
00:44:58.735 --> 00:45:00.460
I'll walk you to the subway.

1299
00:45:00.495 --> 00:45:02.428
- We practically just met, okay?

1300
00:45:02.462 --> 00:45:03.981
Women hate to be used.

1301
00:45:04.016 --> 00:45:05.327
I hate to be used.

1302
00:45:05.362 --> 00:45:06.363
- I'm hip.

1303
00:45:06.397 --> 00:45:07.847
Put on your shoes...

1304
00:45:07.882 --> 00:45:08.710
- Mm-mm.

1305
00:45:08.745 --> 00:45:09.987
You're a very strange boy, Huey.

1306
00:45:10.022 --> 00:45:11.679
You're just used to women just
falling all over you, okay?


1307
00:45:11.713 --> 00:45:13.404
And I don't why you men
have to see beautiful


1308
00:45:13.439 --> 00:45:14.889
women as threats every time.

1309
00:45:14.923 --> 00:45:16.338
I just, I need my coffee.

1310
00:45:16.373 --> 00:45:17.167
- I'm out.

1311
00:45:17.201 --> 00:45:18.444
- I have money.

1312
00:45:20.273 --> 00:45:22.724
- You got enough for breakfast?

1313
00:45:22.759 --> 00:45:24.312
- Uh-huh.

1314
00:45:24.346 --> 00:45:28.316
- Hey, bring me a couple
of bagels back, will you?


1315
00:45:28.350 --> 00:45:29.524
- Any particular kind?

1316
00:45:29.558 --> 00:45:31.215
- Baby, I trust you.

1317
00:45:34.356 --> 00:45:38.706
- So, why does Bernard say
that you've fallen apart?


1318
00:45:41.053 --> 00:45:43.400
- I don't answer
analytic questions.


1319
00:45:43.434 --> 00:45:45.678
- Analysts don't ask questions,
they wait,


1320
00:45:45.713 --> 00:45:47.715
and I'm not waiting.

1321
00:45:47.749 --> 00:45:48.681
- Well, I could give
you a different answer


1322
00:45:48.716 --> 00:45:50.338
for every day of the week.

1323
00:45:50.372 --> 00:45:52.616
Um, my wife fucked me over.

1324
00:45:53.824 --> 00:45:55.067
Muscle tone.

1325
00:45:55.101 --> 00:45:56.344
Yeah, that's a good one.

1326
00:45:56.378 --> 00:45:59.105
A guy like me loses
muscle tone...


1327
00:45:59.140 --> 00:46:01.936
- So, why did you ask me
to dinner?


1328
00:46:01.970 --> 00:46:03.800
- You need a reason
'cause you're an analyst?


1329
00:46:03.834 --> 00:46:04.766
- No.

1330
00:46:04.801 --> 00:46:06.561
- Motivation.

1331
00:46:06.595 --> 00:46:08.183
You wanna know my motivation.

1332
00:46:08.218 --> 00:46:09.184
- Does this ever stop?

1333
00:46:09.219 --> 00:46:10.427
This performance?

1334
00:46:10.461 --> 00:46:11.255
- The Huey act?

1335
00:46:11.290 --> 00:46:12.256
- Oh, is that what you call it?

1336
00:46:12.291 --> 00:46:13.119
- Mm-hmm.

1337
00:46:14.811 --> 00:46:17.158
This time in my life is what?

1338
00:46:17.192 --> 00:46:18.780
Reversal time?

1339
00:46:18.815 --> 00:46:21.334
Y'know, when I knew
Bernard, he never made out.


1340
00:46:21.369 --> 00:46:22.301
Never!

1341
00:46:22.335 --> 00:46:23.854
- That no longer seems to be
his problem.


1342
00:46:23.889 --> 00:46:24.717
- And now it's, like, what?

1343
00:46:24.752 --> 00:46:25.960
A fuckin' joke?

1344
00:46:25.994 --> 00:46:28.514
It's like I'm him and he's me!

1345
00:46:31.897 --> 00:46:35.038
He's seein' a new chick,
you know.


1346
00:46:35.072 --> 00:46:38.041
- So you wanna sleep with me.

1347
00:46:38.075 --> 00:46:39.801
- She's young.

1348
00:46:39.836 --> 00:46:41.009
- And I'm not?

1349
00:46:41.044 --> 00:46:42.424
- [Huey] I've got no
frame of reference


1350
00:46:42.459 --> 00:46:44.392
for any chick under 40.

1351
00:46:46.394 --> 00:46:48.603
- I'm not gonna sleep with you,
Huey.


1352
00:46:48.637 --> 00:46:51.433
- 20 years ago, you would have.

1353
00:46:51.468 --> 00:46:52.365
Believe me.

1354
00:46:54.643 --> 00:46:57.129
- Okay, can we talk about
something else?


1355
00:46:57.163 --> 00:46:59.545
How's your daughter?

1356
00:46:59.579 --> 00:47:01.374
- That's who he's dating.

1357
00:47:01.409 --> 00:47:02.582
- He told you?

1358
00:47:03.929 --> 00:47:06.794
- You think you're the
only shrink in the room?


1359
00:47:06.828 --> 00:47:09.693
He brings up old grudges,
he's mad at me all the time.


1360
00:47:09.727 --> 00:47:11.695
He didn't have to tell me.

1361
00:47:11.729 --> 00:47:12.869
- Well, does it bother you?

1362
00:47:12.903 --> 00:47:15.078
- Fuck yes, it bothers me!

1363
00:47:17.114 --> 00:47:20.428
You think I don't have feelings?

1364
00:47:20.462 --> 00:47:22.119
He's my only friend!

1365
00:47:24.432 --> 00:47:25.985
She's got my genes.

1366
00:47:28.263 --> 00:47:29.989
She will butcher him.

1367
00:47:33.096 --> 00:47:34.235
- [Zelda] Okay, look.

1368
00:47:34.269 --> 00:47:36.099
Do you like this?

1369
00:47:36.133 --> 00:47:36.927
- [Bernard] I don't.

1370
00:47:36.962 --> 00:47:38.377
You want me to be honest?

1371
00:47:38.411 --> 00:47:40.620
I don't understand it.

1372
00:47:40.655 --> 00:47:41.829
- [Zelda] Want some molly?

1373
00:47:41.863 --> 00:47:43.692
- [Bernard] What? No.

1374
00:47:44.003 --> 00:47:47.006
- All right. Suit yourself.

1375
00:47:48.111 --> 00:47:52.701
- [Woman] "Ich bin Scheisse.
Du bist Scheisse,
Maänner sind Scheisse"


1376
00:47:53.357 --> 00:47:55.428
- You're not supportive
of my work.


1377
00:47:55.463 --> 00:47:57.706
- [Woman] "Maänner sind Hunde..."

1378
00:47:58.121 --> 00:47:59.053
- Yes, I am.

1379
00:47:59.087 --> 00:48:00.054
- You're not.

1380
00:48:00.088 --> 00:48:01.469
You never ask to see what I'm
working on.


1381
00:48:01.503 --> 00:48:03.989
- I won't understand it,
and then you get mad at me.


1382
00:48:04.023 --> 00:48:04.886
- See!

1383
00:48:04.921 --> 00:48:06.508
You're not supportive!

1384
00:48:06.543 --> 00:48:08.441
- You want me to lie and
tell you I like something


1385
00:48:08.476 --> 00:48:09.477
I don't get?

1386
00:48:10.581 --> 00:48:11.375
- See, I don't understand why
you say


1387
00:48:11.410 --> 00:48:12.549
that you're supportive,

1388
00:48:12.583 --> 00:48:14.551
and then you sabotage
me like this.


1389
00:48:14.585 --> 00:48:17.588
- 'Cause I am supportive of you!

1390
00:48:17.623 --> 00:48:19.487
Does it mean I have to
understand your work?


1391
00:48:19.521 --> 00:48:22.800
- You just want me to be a
trophy, like an adornment.


1392
00:48:22.835 --> 00:48:24.733
- All you ever do is talk
about is your career.


1393
00:48:24.768 --> 00:48:25.942
- Because I'm young!

1394
00:48:25.976 --> 00:48:27.150
I have to talk about my career!

1395
00:48:27.184 --> 00:48:28.530
You don't have to talk about
your career


1396
00:48:28.565 --> 00:48:30.636
because you've already arrived!

1397
00:48:30.670 --> 00:48:32.293
I have not arrived, and,
frankly, you're standing


1398
00:48:32.327 --> 00:48:33.328
in my way.

1399
00:48:33.363 --> 00:48:34.640
- That's just plain stupid.
C'mon.


1400
00:48:34.674 --> 00:48:37.505
- I don't want us to
stay at my place anymore.


1401
00:48:38.471 --> 00:48:40.784
- [Woman] "...Maänner sind
Scheisse..."


1402
00:48:40.818 --> 00:48:41.889
- [Bernard] So, what do you
think, Mona?


1403
00:48:41.923 --> 00:48:43.545
- All right, lets, this is...

1404
00:48:43.580 --> 00:48:44.719
This is shit.

1405
00:48:44.753 --> 00:48:45.754
- Mona, c'mon...

1406
00:48:45.789 --> 00:48:46.721
- No, why, why are you
showing me this shit?


1407
00:48:46.755 --> 00:48:48.102
- Is it that bad?

1408
00:48:48.136 --> 00:48:49.379
- Oh, c'mon, Bernard, look,

1409
00:48:49.413 --> 00:48:51.829
look, I haven't seen you in the
graphic novel department in,


1410
00:48:51.864 --> 00:48:52.623
what, what is it?

1411
00:48:52.658 --> 00:48:53.452
Like 15 years?

1412
00:48:53.486 --> 00:48:54.280
Right?

1413
00:48:54.315 --> 00:48:55.109
I mean, what is it?

1414
00:48:55.143 --> 00:48:56.179
Slow day in nonfiction
down there?


1415
00:48:56.213 --> 00:48:57.352
- Historical nonfiction.

1416
00:48:57.387 --> 00:48:59.423
Believe me, it's a lot slower
than actual nonfiction.


1417
00:48:59.458 --> 00:49:00.459
- Why are you pushing this girl?

1418
00:49:00.493 --> 00:49:01.287
- I'm not pushing her, Mona.

1419
00:49:01.322 --> 00:49:02.323
- You're pushin' her.

1420
00:49:02.357 --> 00:49:04.601
- I'm just soliciting
an objective opinion,


1421
00:49:04.635 --> 00:49:05.429
That's all.

1422
00:49:05.464 --> 00:49:08.122
- Here, you got
exploding penises!


1423
00:49:08.156 --> 00:49:09.261
And what's this?

1424
00:49:09.295 --> 00:49:11.780
Oh, it's a penis that
ejaculates carbon emissions.


1425
00:49:11.815 --> 00:49:12.609
Huh!

1426
00:49:12.643 --> 00:49:13.713
Ooh, oh, here!

1427
00:49:13.748 --> 00:49:15.715
This guy's penis gets
cut off in a subway door!


1428
00:49:15.750 --> 00:49:17.303
Nice, nice...

1429
00:49:17.338 --> 00:49:19.271
Your, uh, your girlfriend's
got a problem with men.


1430
00:49:19.305 --> 00:49:20.651
- Stop calling her
my girlfriend.


1431
00:49:20.686 --> 00:49:21.480
Please.

1432
00:49:21.514 --> 00:49:22.308
- Oh, give me a break!

1433
00:49:22.343 --> 00:49:23.137
You like this stuff?

1434
00:49:23.171 --> 00:49:23.965
- I don't know.

1435
00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:25.139
- Bernard, look at this!

1436
00:49:25.173 --> 00:49:27.520
This guy has a cock that
turns into a hangman's noose.


1437
00:49:27.555 --> 00:49:30.109
This, uh, Zelda Beauchamp,
shomp,


1438
00:49:30.144 --> 00:49:31.904
she's got a problem.

1439
00:49:31.939 --> 00:49:32.974
- She's a feminist.

1440
00:49:33.009 --> 00:49:33.802
A feminist!

1441
00:49:33.837 --> 00:49:34.838
- Stop it!

1442
00:49:34.872 --> 00:49:36.115
I'm a feminist, and I
don't want to hang men


1443
00:49:36.150 --> 00:49:36.978
by their penises.

1444
00:49:37.013 --> 00:49:38.083
She's a sick-o!

1445
00:49:38.117 --> 00:49:39.843
- It is the daughter of a
very old friend of mine.


1446
00:49:39.877 --> 00:49:41.431
This is not her.

1447
00:49:41.465 --> 00:49:43.743
This is political for her!

1448
00:49:43.778 --> 00:49:46.263
Just use her, can you
use her, just please?


1449
00:49:46.298 --> 00:49:47.747
- [Woman] No, look,
you know, no...


1450
00:49:47.782 --> 00:49:49.059
- In an ebook or something?

1451
00:49:49.094 --> 00:49:50.302
- [Mona] No, I don't like
the pressure, Bernard.


1452
00:49:50.336 --> 00:49:53.305
- Need another intern, along
with the other ones you get?


1453
00:49:53.339 --> 00:49:55.997
- Zelda... Beauchamp...?

1454
00:49:56.032 --> 00:49:56.894
Beauchamp...?

1455
00:49:56.929 --> 00:49:57.723
- Ya.

1456
00:49:57.757 --> 00:50:00.174
- I knew a Beauchamp years...

1457
00:50:01.071 --> 00:50:02.003
Is that Huey?

1458
00:50:02.038 --> 00:50:03.384
Huey's daughter?

1459
00:50:03.418 --> 00:50:04.212
- Are you serious?

1460
00:50:04.247 --> 00:50:05.041
- Huey Beauchamp?

1461
00:50:05.075 --> 00:50:05.903
- You know Huey?

1462
00:50:05.938 --> 00:50:07.077
- Are you fucking kidding me?

1463
00:50:07.112 --> 00:50:08.216
- I can tell that you know
Huey...


1464
00:50:08.251 --> 00:50:09.183
- Are you kidding me!?

1465
00:50:09.217 --> 00:50:10.011
- [Bernard] Damm it!

1466
00:50:10.046 --> 00:50:11.461
- You bring that shit up here?

1467
00:50:11.495 --> 00:50:13.946
- When I go out with, say, a

1468
00:50:13.981 --> 00:50:16.155
I mean, I know, I'm sure
people are whispering,


1469
00:50:16.190 --> 00:50:18.537
"What's that old man doing
with that young girl?"


1470
00:50:18.571 --> 00:50:21.402
But put me in that same
restaurant with, say,


1471
00:50:21.436 --> 00:50:24.370
someone Roz's age,
and all I'm thinking


1472
00:50:24.405 --> 00:50:27.442
is, "What's this boyish fellow
doing with this old woman?"


1473
00:50:27.477 --> 00:50:29.410
And, I know, that's horrible!

1474
00:50:29.444 --> 00:50:30.273
Augh!

1475
00:50:31.343 --> 00:50:33.241
I can't help it.

1476
00:50:33.276 --> 00:50:37.038
I'm addicted to youth and
I am bothered by age...


1477
00:50:37.073 --> 00:50:39.385
Mostly mine, I guess.

1478
00:50:39.420 --> 00:50:42.043
But these younger women,

1479
00:50:42.078 --> 00:50:46.634
I mean I can't forget AIDS,
which I think is less of a risk,


1480
00:50:46.668 --> 00:50:48.739
I mean, y'know,
with older women because,


1481
00:50:48.774 --> 00:50:52.053
generally, they don't
sleep around as much.


1482
00:50:52.088 --> 00:50:55.608
But, with a younger woman
with experience,


1483
00:50:55.643 --> 00:50:56.644
I mean, how do you know?

1484
00:50:56.678 --> 00:50:59.060
I mean, a woman with
a lot of experience.


1485
00:50:59.095 --> 00:51:00.544
Does she know?

1486
00:51:00.579 --> 00:51:02.546
It's not heavy for them.

1487
00:51:02.581 --> 00:51:05.825
Do they even practice safe sex?

1488
00:51:05.860 --> 00:51:08.000
Y'know, safer sex?

1489
00:51:08.035 --> 00:51:09.070
Jeez.

1490
00:51:09.105 --> 00:51:12.039
I mean, I'd rather just
masturbate.


1491
00:51:13.868 --> 00:51:15.421
I mean, is that it?

1492
00:51:15.456 --> 00:51:17.458
Is that the bottom line?

1493
00:51:19.632 --> 00:51:21.772
In order to play it safe,

1494
00:51:21.807 --> 00:51:23.360
I have to end up marrying
a woman who's old enough


1495
00:51:23.395 --> 00:51:24.568
to be my wife?

1496
00:51:27.157 --> 00:51:28.917
Okay, say, I invited someone to
join us


1497
00:51:28.952 --> 00:51:31.437
who says she used to know you.

1498
00:51:35.027 --> 00:51:36.615
"Put on your shoes.

1499
00:51:36.649 --> 00:51:39.135
"I'll walk you to the subway?"

1500
00:51:44.899 --> 00:51:46.970
[laughs]

1501
00:51:48.144 --> 00:51:50.215
- You wanna grab a bagel?

1502
00:51:51.181 --> 00:51:53.114
- Well, outside of this
particular material, Sid,


1503
00:51:53.149 --> 00:51:56.152
what do you think of her stuff?

1504
00:51:56.186 --> 00:51:58.154
She's very young, but
I don't think R. Crumb


1505
00:51:58.188 --> 00:52:00.535
is the worst influence
in the world, is he?


1506
00:52:00.570 --> 00:52:02.089
We're all influenced, Sid.

1507
00:52:02.123 --> 00:52:03.400
When Art Spiegleman started out,
I'm sure


1508
00:52:03.435 --> 00:52:07.163
his work looked like shit, too,
I suppose.


1509
00:52:07.197 --> 00:52:09.372
Just, sleep on it, please.

1510
00:52:10.683 --> 00:52:14.446
I think she could be an
innovative force at Penguin.


1511
00:52:14.480 --> 00:52:15.585
Just because.

1512
00:52:15.619 --> 00:52:17.966
Our Norton editors don't
understand Millennials,


1513
00:52:18.001 --> 00:52:18.933
that's why.

1514
00:52:20.693 --> 00:52:21.487
Thank you.

1515
00:52:21.522 --> 00:52:22.350
Thank you!

1516
00:52:24.387 --> 00:52:26.975
Well, I already picked
up the tickets, Zelda.


1517
00:52:27.010 --> 00:52:28.149
It's French...

1518
00:52:29.046 --> 00:52:31.118
I dunno, I think it's a musical.

1519
00:52:31.152 --> 00:52:32.533
I don't understand.

1520
00:52:32.567 --> 00:52:33.948
Didn't you know about
this Kollective meeting


1521
00:52:33.982 --> 00:52:36.226
when we met at lunch?

1522
00:52:36.261 --> 00:52:37.779
Were you just gonna let me wait
out here


1523
00:52:37.814 --> 00:52:38.711
until the show started?

1524
00:52:38.746 --> 00:52:40.989
What if I hadn't called?

1525
00:52:41.024 --> 00:52:45.132
No, no, I don't think I'm
only thinking of myself.


1526
00:52:46.374 --> 00:52:48.031
All right, no, yeah.

1527
00:52:48.065 --> 00:52:52.104
I guess I'm seeing a French
maybe-musical by myself.


1528
00:52:52.139 --> 00:52:53.347
All right, bye.

1529
00:52:55.383 --> 00:52:58.386
[rhythmic pounding]

1530
00:53:00.975 --> 00:53:02.666
- [Huey] You want me to stop,
Mona?


1531
00:53:02.701 --> 00:53:03.495
- Huey, are you...

1532
00:53:03.529 --> 00:53:04.323
- [Huey] Oh, Mona!

1533
00:53:04.358 --> 00:53:05.186
- [Mona] Don't stop.

1534
00:53:05.221 --> 00:53:07.015
No, don't stop!

1535
00:53:07.050 --> 00:53:07.947
Wait! Wait!

00:53:09.777 --> 00:53:11.088
Jesus!

1538
00:53:11.123 --> 00:53:12.228
- [Huey] Give it to me baby!

1539
00:53:12.262 --> 00:53:13.470
Oh, Mona!

1540
00:53:13.505 --> 00:53:16.508
[moans and screams]

1541
00:53:22.962 --> 00:53:25.206
- [Bernard] So, did, uh,
she say when she'd be back?


1542
00:53:25.241 --> 00:53:27.208
- [Celia] Not to me.

1543
00:53:27.243 --> 00:53:28.071
- That's a cute dog.

1544
00:53:28.105 --> 00:53:28.899
Whose dog is this?

1545
00:53:28.934 --> 00:53:30.177
- It's Zelda's.

1546
00:53:33.041 --> 00:53:35.975
- She didn't tell me
she had a dog.


1547
00:53:38.185 --> 00:53:39.669
She didn't tell me
she had a dog.


1548
00:53:39.703 --> 00:53:41.395
- She got it today.

1549
00:53:41.429 --> 00:53:46.296
- Look, we don't know when
she's coming back, okay?


1550
00:53:46.331 --> 00:53:50.024
- She didn't tell me she'd
bought a dog.


1551
00:53:50.058 --> 00:53:53.165
[moaning and screaming]

1552
00:53:53.200 --> 00:53:54.856
You're kidding.

[moaning]

1555

- [Huey] Oooooh!

1556
00:54:04.866 --> 00:54:05.660
There we go!

1557
00:54:05.695 --> 00:54:06.868
Ooh!

1558
00:54:06.903 --> 00:54:07.835
- [Zelda] What?

1559
00:54:07.869 --> 00:54:08.698
- Zelda, what...

1560
00:54:08.732 --> 00:54:09.871
- [Zelda] Nope, sorry,
I'm not here.


1561
00:54:09.906 --> 00:54:10.941
- Zelda, I was by your...

The option I want is
"Leave a fucking message!"

00:54:18.052 --> 00:54:19.985
- Zelda, please call me...

1574
00:54:28.338 --> 00:54:29.926
- [Zelda] Bernie, please don't
judge me.


1575
00:54:29.960 --> 00:54:30.754
Okay?

1576
00:54:30.789 --> 00:54:31.583
- Don't judge you?

1577
00:54:31.617 --> 00:54:32.791
Standing me up, twice...

1578
00:54:32.825 --> 00:54:34.310
I mean, you don't return
my calls or texts!


1579
00:54:34.344 --> 00:54:36.726
- I'm sorry, it's something
I had to test out.


1580
00:54:36.760 --> 00:54:37.554
- So this is a plan?

1581
00:54:37.589 --> 00:54:38.383
This is a plan?

1582
00:54:38.417 --> 00:54:39.867
- Yes, yes, deprivation control.

1583
00:54:39.901 --> 00:54:40.764
- What the fuck?

1584
00:54:40.799 --> 00:54:41.903
- It's important for me to
graph how,


1585
00:54:41.938 --> 00:54:43.836
how much I would miss
you if you were gone.


1586
00:54:43.871 --> 00:54:44.665
- So, this is an experiment?

1587
00:54:44.699 --> 00:54:45.493
That's what you're saying.

1588
00:54:45.528 --> 00:54:46.494
This is an experiment?

1589
00:54:46.529 --> 00:54:48.427
- Yes, yes, and, and
we did it for five days


1590
00:54:48.462 --> 00:54:51.154
and, and I got a lot done, okay?

1591
00:54:51.188 --> 00:54:53.121
I know that it was hard,
but I actually felt


1592
00:54:53.156 --> 00:54:54.295
really inspired during
that time.


1593
00:54:54.330 --> 00:54:55.123
- Yeah, yeah.

1594
00:54:55.158 --> 00:54:55.952
You bought a dog.

1595
00:54:55.986 --> 00:54:57.022
- Yeah, Fred!

1596
00:54:57.056 --> 00:54:58.403
- Are you breaking up with me?

1597
00:54:58.437 --> 00:54:59.921
Is that what's happening?

1598
00:54:59.956 --> 00:55:01.682
- Because, because I got Fred?

1599
00:55:01.716 --> 00:55:02.510
- I don't know.

1600
00:55:02.545 --> 00:55:03.684
- Bernie!

1601
00:55:03.718 --> 00:55:05.030
- I felt I knew you, I did.

1602
00:55:05.064 --> 00:55:06.273
- Oh my God.

1603
00:55:06.307 --> 00:55:07.101
You're being so dramatic.

1604
00:55:07.135 --> 00:55:07.929
- I just don't understand.

1605
00:55:07.964 --> 00:55:08.758
- Relax!

1606
00:55:08.792 --> 00:55:09.759
Come here.

1607
00:55:09.793 --> 00:55:11.519
I am trying to find a way to
stay with you


1608
00:55:11.554 --> 00:55:13.314
and not go completely insane.

1609
00:55:13.349 --> 00:55:14.142
Okay.

1610
00:55:14.177 --> 00:55:15.040
It's a good thing.

1611
00:55:15.074 --> 00:55:16.006
- No, no, stop.

1612
00:55:16.041 --> 00:55:17.353
- Come on, come on.

1613
00:55:17.387 --> 00:55:19.424
Look, I have to protect myself,
you know?


1614
00:55:19.458 --> 00:55:20.321
- But what about me?

1615
00:55:20.356 --> 00:55:22.047
- I don't want you to get hurt,
either.


1616
00:55:22.081 --> 00:55:23.635
Y'know, I'm just trying
to check in


1617
00:55:23.669 --> 00:55:25.706
and be healthy.

1618
00:55:25.740 --> 00:55:27.639
I'm not gonna let you
devour me, Bernie.


1619
00:55:27.673 --> 00:55:29.537
- Oh, all right.

1620
00:55:29.572 --> 00:55:31.505
- You know what the
hardest part was, though?


1621
00:55:31.539 --> 00:55:32.471
- What?

1622
00:55:32.506 --> 00:55:35.405
- Missing your little ass.

1623
00:55:35.440 --> 00:55:36.268
And your little pot.

1624
00:55:36.303 --> 00:55:37.096
- Pot?

1625
00:55:37.131 --> 00:55:38.477
Ohhh.

1626
00:55:38.512 --> 00:55:39.582
You know, my girlfriends
are always talking


1627
00:55:39.616 --> 00:55:42.619
about how old you are, but
I don't even notice it.

I mean, you tire easily, but I
do have that effect on people.


1630
00:55:48.384 --> 00:55:50.282
- Well, we'll fix that.

Ah-ha.

1633
00:56:15.307 --> 00:56:16.929
Can I look?

1634
00:56:16.964 --> 00:56:17.723
- Don't tell me.

you know?

1665
00:57:21.615 --> 00:57:24.687
He just, he emanates
such an aura.


1666

I don't think he's changed at
all, do you?

I mean, not really.

He was never boyish.

00:57:34.490 --> 00:57:37.113
He was manly at 23, he's
even more manly now.


1673
00:57:37.147 --> 00:57:39.736
He's just kinda settled
into himself.

Bruised, though, you can
tell, really bruised.

Years have bruised him.

1677
00:57:45.639 --> 00:57:48.780
He's a businessman who dared
to live like an artist.


1678
00:57:48.814 --> 00:57:51.368
But his art is himself.

1679
00:57:51.403 --> 00:57:53.716
He's way more intellectual
than either of my husbands,

both of whom were
associate professors.

1682

I probably should get
to finishing this salad.


1683

- It's so great to be with
him again!


1684
00:58:02.414 --> 00:58:04.347
I can't believe,
after all these years,


1685
00:58:04.381 --> 00:58:07.454
that our lives have
found each other!

you just take this salad.

You don't want it?

01:01:39.217 --> 01:01:41.322
But he just doesn't give
out the number?


1796
01:01:41.357 --> 01:01:42.876
I think, I think out of spite
he's giving


1797
01:01:42.910 --> 01:01:43.877
them my home phone.

1798
01:01:43.911 --> 01:01:44.705
I don't know.

1799
01:01:44.740 --> 01:01:45.637
You know?

1800
01:01:45.672 --> 01:01:46.742
And I put in a long day,
lemme tell you.


1801
01:01:46.776 --> 01:01:48.122
No matter what you all may think

1802
01:01:48.157 --> 01:01:49.848
about historical nonfiction,

1803
01:01:49.883 --> 01:01:51.539
I don't wanna come home
to the phone ringing


1804
01:01:51.574 --> 01:01:53.162
off the goddamn hook,
and I have to look for


1805
01:01:53.196 --> 01:01:55.026
a goddamn pen and some paper.

1806
01:01:55.060 --> 01:01:56.268
And for who?

1807
01:01:56.303 --> 01:01:57.097
For who?

1808
01:01:57.131 --> 01:01:57.925
For Huey?

1809
01:01:57.960 --> 01:01:58.754
For your dad?

1810
01:01:58.788 --> 01:01:59.720
Fuck that!

1811
01:01:59.755 --> 01:02:00.997
Are you ser...?

1812
01:02:02.102 --> 01:02:05.036
How much poop can a
small dog have?


1813
01:02:05.968 --> 01:02:08.384
- You know, one moment,
he is so attentive,


1814
01:02:08.418 --> 01:02:11.214
and the next, it's like he's
like he's the invisible man.


1815
01:02:11.249 --> 01:02:12.043
You know?

1816
01:02:12.077 --> 01:02:13.009
I mean, is it something
I'm doing?


1817
01:02:13.044 --> 01:02:13.838
- No.

1818
01:02:13.872 --> 01:02:14.701
- I ask him if
something's wrong...


1819
01:02:14.735 --> 01:02:15.909
- It's not you.

1820
01:02:15.943 --> 01:02:17.186
- And he gives me that look,
that face, that's, that's


1821
01:02:17.220 --> 01:02:19.498
like straight from the grave.

1822
01:02:19.533 --> 01:02:20.361
Ohhh.

1823
01:02:20.396 --> 01:02:21.984
Yesterday afternoon,
I called him.


1824
01:02:22.018 --> 01:02:24.883
He said hold on, never
came back to the phone.


1825
01:02:24.918 --> 01:02:25.712
Never.

1826
01:02:25.746 --> 01:02:26.540
No.

1827
01:02:26.574 --> 01:02:27.644
- Never comes back.

1828
01:02:27.679 --> 01:02:28.922
- And just when I think
I'm at the end of my rope,


1829
01:02:28.956 --> 01:02:31.131
he does something terrific or
he says something terrific,


1830
01:02:31.165 --> 01:02:32.166
and...

1831
01:02:32.201 --> 01:02:33.064
- That's what he does.

1832
01:02:33.098 --> 01:02:34.168
I warned you.

1833
01:02:34.203 --> 01:02:35.549
- It's a disease.
It's really a disease.


1834
01:02:35.583 --> 01:02:36.723
- [Zelda] ...hanging by his
own penis


1835
01:02:36.757 --> 01:02:39.760
I wish there was some drug,
some anti-Huey-biotic.


1836
01:02:39.795 --> 01:02:42.176
You ever experience anything
like this?


1837
01:02:42.211 --> 01:02:44.282
[Zelda laughter]

1838
01:02:44.316 --> 01:02:45.110
- Hmm?

1839
01:02:45.145 --> 01:02:46.042
Uh...

1840
01:02:46.077 --> 01:02:46.974
- [Mona] Okay, that's all right.

1841
01:02:47.009 --> 01:02:48.458
- Yes.

1842
01:02:48.493 --> 01:02:49.839
- [Roz] I don't have to
defend myself.


1843
01:02:49.874 --> 01:02:51.772
- That's not why I'm here.

1844
01:02:51.807 --> 01:02:53.567
- And I certainly
don't need to feel guilty.


1845
01:02:53.601 --> 01:02:54.913
- Oh, but I do?

1846
01:02:54.948 --> 01:02:56.190
Is that it?

1847
01:02:56.225 --> 01:02:57.364
What do you see in him, Roz?

1848
01:02:57.398 --> 01:02:59.469
Because I keep playing it
over and over in my mind.


1849
01:02:59.504 --> 01:03:00.677
You're a victim.

1850
01:03:00.712 --> 01:03:01.920
You're an accident victim.

1851
01:03:01.955 --> 01:03:03.611
- I am not a victim!

1852
01:03:03.646 --> 01:03:04.509
That would be,

1853
01:03:04.543 --> 01:03:06.580
it would be like
blaming a pedestrian


1854
01:03:06.614 --> 01:03:08.237
for getting hit by a semi.

1855
01:03:08.271 --> 01:03:09.065
He's fat!

1856
01:03:09.100 --> 01:03:10.653
He's old, he's bald!

1857
01:03:10.687 --> 01:03:11.688
He looks 60!

1858
01:03:12.586 --> 01:03:13.380
So, what is it?

1859
01:03:13.414 --> 01:03:14.277
What do you see, Roz?

1860
01:03:14.312 --> 01:03:15.278
- He doesn't look 60.

1861
01:03:15.313 --> 01:03:16.383
- Oh, please, okay, yeah.

1862
01:03:16.417 --> 01:03:17.418
Take his side.

1863
01:03:17.453 --> 01:03:18.592
- [Roz] And don't you
dare call me a victim.


1864
01:03:18.626 --> 01:03:20.318
- [Bernard] How could you
let him?


1865
01:03:20.352 --> 01:03:23.045
With our friendship is
at stake here?


1866
01:03:23.079 --> 01:03:24.391
- What about Zelda?

1867
01:03:24.425 --> 01:03:25.219
- What, no!

1868
01:03:25.254 --> 01:03:26.048
No.

1869
01:03:26.082 --> 01:03:28.291
What, Zelda and I
could never have


1870
01:03:28.326 --> 01:03:29.465
what you and I had.

1871
01:03:29.499 --> 01:03:30.915
- Such as?

1872
01:03:30.949 --> 01:03:31.916
- Companionship!

1873
01:03:31.950 --> 01:03:33.434
Fucking trust!

1874
01:03:33.469 --> 01:03:34.608
All right?

1875
01:03:34.642 --> 01:03:38.957
What Zelda and I have is
something completely different.


1876
01:03:39.855 --> 01:03:40.648
- Are you all right?

1877
01:03:40.683 --> 01:03:41.718
- Yes!

1878
01:03:41.753 --> 01:03:44.342
Look, Zelda is very
aware of what she's doing.


1879
01:03:44.376 --> 01:03:45.412
So am I.

1880
01:03:45.446 --> 01:03:47.000
We're working it out.

1881
01:03:47.034 --> 01:03:48.001
All right?

1882
01:03:48.035 --> 01:03:49.554
But you, you're the
only one I can talk to,


1883
01:03:49.588 --> 01:03:50.831
really talk to.

1884
01:03:50.866 --> 01:03:54.421
So ask yourself,
why did you do it?


1885
01:03:54.455 --> 01:03:56.112
It's some kind of a
reverse miracle.


1886
01:03:56.147 --> 01:03:58.977
- No, don't! Aw, you, gaahhhh!

1887
01:03:59.909 --> 01:04:02.015
I hate your analyst's voice.

1888
01:04:02.049 --> 01:04:03.188
- Huey set you up.

1889
01:04:03.223 --> 01:04:04.017
- What?

1890
01:04:04.051 --> 01:04:05.328
Okay, yeah, Huey set me up!

1891
01:04:05.363 --> 01:04:06.226
How did Huey set me?

1892
01:04:06.260 --> 01:04:07.054
What?

1893
01:04:07.089 --> 01:04:07.883
You mean Zelda?

1894
01:04:07.917 --> 01:04:08.745
No!

1895
01:04:08.780 --> 01:04:10.402
You told me to see Zelda!

1896
01:04:10.437 --> 01:04:13.026
You're the only one I
listen to, so you ask.


1897
01:04:13.060 --> 01:04:14.475
What do you mean, hmm?

1898
01:04:14.510 --> 01:04:15.580
What do you mean?

1899
01:04:15.614 --> 01:04:17.547
What do you mean,
Huey set me up?


1900
01:04:17.582 --> 01:04:18.686
- Explain it to me.

1901
01:04:18.721 --> 01:04:20.654
You've gone back to being the
old Bernard.


1902
01:04:20.688 --> 01:04:21.482
No!

1903
01:04:21.517 --> 01:04:22.483
No!

1904
01:04:22.518 --> 01:04:25.348
- And he's gone back
to being the old Huey.


1905
01:04:25.383 --> 01:04:26.798
Think about it!

1906
01:04:26.833 --> 01:04:29.318
And then you explain it to me.

1907
01:04:31.147 --> 01:04:33.736
[door opening]

1908
01:04:35.013 --> 01:04:35.842
- Bernard!

1909
01:04:41.537 --> 01:04:43.021
Mmmmm...

1910
01:04:43.056 --> 01:04:43.884
Bernard!

1911
01:04:47.336 --> 01:04:48.164
Aha!

1912
01:04:49.994 --> 01:04:52.375
Two ships that pass
in the night.


1913
01:04:52.410 --> 01:04:55.102
Not good for a relationship.

1914
01:04:55.137 --> 01:04:58.312
I brought a little,
a little toast.


1915
01:04:58.347 --> 01:05:00.763
To lovin' 'em and leavin' 'em,

1916
01:05:00.797 --> 01:05:03.076
and lovin' 'em and leavin'
again, baby!


1917
01:05:03.110 --> 01:05:04.284
- Huey, listen.

1918
01:05:04.318 --> 01:05:06.113
- No, hey, you listen.

1919
01:05:06.148 --> 01:05:08.909
- All I am is a fucking Machine.

1920
01:05:08.944 --> 01:05:09.737
Right?

1921
01:05:09.772 --> 01:05:12.016
Now, I'll admit, 
I'll grant you,

1922
01:05:12.050 --> 01:05:14.190
that machine was broken.

1923
01:05:14.225 --> 01:05:17.021
It needed to go into the shop.

1924
01:05:17.055 --> 01:05:18.401
You're the shop.

1925
01:05:19.678 --> 01:05:21.577
I offered you the
service contract,


1926
01:05:21.611 --> 01:05:24.856
and you could have said,
"Hey, man!


1927
01:05:24.891 --> 01:05:26.513
"Get this Machine off my lot.

1928
01:05:26.547 --> 01:05:27.721
"It's totaled!

1929
01:05:28.584 --> 01:05:30.620
"It's totaled!"

1930
01:05:30.655 --> 01:05:32.899
Hey, but now, I'm repaired.

1931
01:05:35.177 --> 01:05:36.833
Top gear.

1932
01:05:36.868 --> 01:05:37.938
Huh?

1933
01:05:37.973 --> 01:05:40.389
I mean, not it's not,
I'm not state-of-the-art.


1934
01:05:40.423 --> 01:05:42.943
Y'know, that's Youth
-City.

1935
01:05:42.978 --> 01:05:45.463
But I mean, you know, I mean,
I can't do


1936
01:05:45.497 --> 01:05:46.567
what I could.

1937
01:05:47.914 --> 01:05:49.294
But I can travel.

1938
01:05:50.364 --> 01:05:51.814
Y'know?

1939
01:05:51.848 --> 01:05:53.436
I can hug the road.

1940
01:05:54.334 --> 01:05:56.888
I can still corner pretty well.

1941
01:05:56.923 --> 01:05:59.442
[laughs]

1942
01:05:59.477 --> 01:06:01.410
You put that thing in
cruise control.


1943
01:06:01.444 --> 01:06:04.171
Hoh, hoh, hoh, hoh, don't move!

1944
01:06:04.206 --> 01:06:05.724
Aughhh-hohhh.

1945
01:06:05.759 --> 01:06:07.416
[laughing]

1946
01:06:07.450 --> 01:06:08.451
I'm in tune.

1947
01:06:10.246 --> 01:06:11.420
And I owe you.

1948
01:06:12.800 --> 01:06:14.526
Huey is tuned!

1949
01:06:14.561 --> 01:06:15.734
- Great.

1950
01:06:15.769 --> 01:06:18.289
Then why don't you get
you and your Machine,


1951
01:06:18.323 --> 01:06:20.739
and get the hell out of here?

1952
01:06:29.748 --> 01:06:30.577
- Wow.

1953
01:06:32.579 --> 01:06:34.546
That's fucked up.

1954
01:06:34.581 --> 01:06:36.755
[laughing]

1955
01:06:36.790 --> 01:06:39.103
I don't even like champagne!

1956
01:06:44.798 --> 01:06:45.799
- This is more like it, Zelda.

1957
01:06:45.833 --> 01:06:47.939
This is really good stuff.

1958
01:06:47.974 --> 01:06:48.767
- Really?

1959
01:06:48.802 --> 01:06:49.596
- Yeah.

1960
01:06:49.630 --> 01:06:50.804
It's looser.

1961
01:06:50.838 --> 01:06:52.737
It's funnier, less angry.

1962
01:06:52.771 --> 01:06:55.257
It's more knowledgeable
about men,


1963
01:06:55.291 --> 01:06:56.120
seems to me,

1964
01:06:56.154 --> 01:06:58.743
and there aren't any...

1965
01:06:58.777 --> 01:07:01.263
Nope, nope,
no exploding penises.


1966
01:07:01.297 --> 01:07:03.990
So, yeah, this, this could sell.

1967
01:07:05.301 --> 01:07:06.440
- You really think so.

1968
01:07:06.475 --> 01:07:07.303
- Yeah.

1969
01:07:07.338 --> 01:07:08.442
- Oh, Bernie.

1970
01:07:09.340 --> 01:07:13.171
- I have to say, I'm
kind of relieved, y'know.


1971
01:07:14.241 --> 01:07:15.104
I admit that

1972
01:07:15.139 --> 01:07:16.554
I let my imagination run away
with me,


1973
01:07:16.588 --> 01:07:17.900
and I started to think that

1974
01:07:17.934 --> 01:07:21.110
work might be the only
reason that we're...


1975
01:07:21.145 --> 01:07:22.422
That maybe there was
somebody else.


1976
01:07:22.456 --> 01:07:23.526
And, um...

1977
01:07:23.561 --> 01:07:24.389
But now you show me this,

1978
01:07:24.424 --> 01:07:26.598
and it's wonderful, and...

1979
01:07:28.083 --> 01:07:30.361
I just take pride.

1980
01:07:30.395 --> 01:07:31.293
Such pride.

1981
01:07:33.088 --> 01:07:35.055
'Cause I kinda think that,
forgive me,


1982
01:07:35.090 --> 01:07:36.298
that I had a little,

1983
01:07:36.332 --> 01:07:38.576
a little something to do
with this,


1984
01:07:38.610 --> 01:07:40.164
this change in you.

1985
01:07:41.406 --> 01:07:42.200
- Oh.

1986
01:07:42.235 --> 01:07:44.892
- This kind of
humanizing factor.


1987
01:07:44.927 --> 01:07:45.790
- But I should tell you that.

1988
01:07:45.824 --> 01:07:47.481
- Hold on, hold on!

1989
01:07:47.516 --> 01:07:49.759
That's not the best news.

1990
01:07:49.794 --> 01:07:51.416
I kicked out Huey!

1991
01:07:51.451 --> 01:07:52.521
Yeah, I kicked him out.

1992
01:07:52.555 --> 01:07:55.144
Now we can have my
place to ourselves,


1993
01:07:55.179 --> 01:07:58.078
and you can see my place
as it is,


1994
01:07:58.113 --> 01:07:59.769
and see me as I am.

1995
01:07:59.804 --> 01:08:00.598
It's kinda perfect.

1996
01:08:00.632 --> 01:08:01.944
- Wow.

1997
01:08:01.978 --> 01:08:05.258
Okay, uh, but, but, I should
tell you


1998
01:08:05.292 --> 01:08:08.537
that, um, I have met someone,
in a way,


1999
01:08:09.400 --> 01:08:11.919
he's my new collaborator.

2000
01:08:11.954 --> 01:08:13.128
- Oh.

2001
01:08:13.162 --> 01:08:15.544
- If you check the, uh, the
signature there, on the...


2002
01:08:15.578 --> 01:08:16.545
- [Bernard] "Zelda and Scott."

2003
01:08:16.579 --> 01:08:17.373
I was wondering...

2004
01:08:17.408 --> 01:08:18.202
- Yeah.

2005
01:08:18.236 --> 01:08:19.099
- I thought it was a gag, or...

2006
01:08:19.134 --> 01:08:20.583
- Well, um, his name is
Conrad Scott,


2007
01:08:20.618 --> 01:08:22.068
and that's where the yeah...

2008
01:08:22.102 --> 01:08:23.655
That was his idea.

2009
01:08:23.690 --> 01:08:25.761
He actually did most
of the dialogue.


2010
01:08:25.795 --> 01:08:27.659
- The stuff that went in,
in the bubbles?


2011
01:08:27.694 --> 01:08:28.488
Yeah...

2012
01:08:28.522 --> 01:08:29.523
- Yeah, that was all him.

2013
01:08:29.558 --> 01:08:31.077
And, I mean, who knew I would
let a man


2014
01:08:31.111 --> 01:08:33.113
put words in my mouth, right?

2015
01:08:33.148 --> 01:08:34.010
- [Bernard] Right.

2016
01:08:34.045 --> 01:08:36.047
- But, you know,
this guy is magical!


2017
01:08:36.082 --> 01:08:37.566
I mean, it just,
it flows out of him.


2018
01:08:37.600 --> 01:08:38.601
- You, you won't believe it,

2019
01:08:38.636 --> 01:08:41.363
it's like this
incredible force...


2020
01:08:41.397 --> 01:08:42.226
- No, it's great.

2021
01:08:42.260 --> 01:08:43.917
I mean, it can't just be me,
y'know.


2022
01:08:43.951 --> 01:08:45.850
You need a collaborator.

2023
01:08:45.884 --> 01:08:46.920
It's great that you need that.

2024
01:08:46.954 --> 01:08:48.059
And someone to
collaborate with...


2025
01:08:48.094 --> 01:08:48.887
- Yeah.

2026
01:08:48.922 --> 01:08:50.130
I really, I just,

2027
01:08:50.165 --> 01:08:52.615
I think he's going to be the
most amazing partner for me.


2028
01:08:52.650 --> 01:08:53.444
- Work partner.

2029
01:08:53.478 --> 01:08:54.652
- Yeah.

2030
01:08:54.686 --> 01:08:57.033
- I think he could really
take me all the way, y'know.


2031
01:08:57.068 --> 01:09:00.002
We could, we could really
make it big together.


2032
01:09:00.036 --> 01:09:01.969
Change the world.

2033
01:09:02.004 --> 01:09:02.798
So...

2034
01:09:02.832 --> 01:09:03.661
- [Bernard] It's great.

2035
01:09:03.695 --> 01:09:04.765
- And I know he wants
to meet you.


2036
01:09:04.800 --> 01:09:05.628
- Awesome.

2037
01:09:10.254 --> 01:09:11.117
- Ahhh!

2038
01:09:12.532 --> 01:09:13.636
Ohhh!

2039
01:09:13.671 --> 01:09:16.881
Y'see, Bernie, what,
what Zelda is


2040
01:09:16.915 --> 01:09:19.573
is the view from the female gut.

2041
01:09:20.712 --> 01:09:22.990
She offers us pussy-vision.

2042
01:09:24.233 --> 01:09:25.061
Ah.

2043
01:09:25.096 --> 01:09:27.202
She is true and fearless beyond

2044
01:09:27.236 --> 01:09:29.100
the concept of a concept.

2045
01:09:29.135 --> 01:09:30.481
The Super Bowl of truth.

2046
01:09:30.515 --> 01:09:33.173
The kingdom of what is and what
ain't and


2047
01:09:33.208 --> 01:09:35.693
never, no, never,
what should be.


2048
01:09:35.727 --> 01:09:39.179
Take it down, my friend,
take it down.


2049
01:09:39.214 --> 01:09:41.388
Oh, her internal rhythms

2050
01:09:41.423 --> 01:09:45.358
are the syncopation of
ambivalent regard,


2051
01:09:45.392 --> 01:09:48.499
the duality of
improvisational karma,


2052
01:09:49.983 --> 01:09:53.193
the existential corollary
of the four a.m. fuck.


2053
01:09:53.228 --> 01:09:54.850
She is deep, and she is dirty.

2054
01:09:54.884 --> 01:09:58.888
I love, and I mean truly
fuckin' love, the balls


2055
01:10:01.615 --> 01:10:03.376
on this here female.

2056
01:10:03.410 --> 01:10:05.723
[giggles]

2057
01:10:05.757 --> 01:10:09.934
- Well, um, we should
probably get up from this...


2058
01:10:09.968 --> 01:10:13.696
It was, uh, awesome getting to
meet you.


2059
01:10:13.731 --> 01:10:15.215
- Isn't he just outrageous?

2060
01:10:15.250 --> 01:10:17.183
- He is something.

2061
01:10:17.217 --> 01:10:18.080
- [Conrad] Absolute pleasure.

2062
01:10:18.114 --> 01:10:19.875
I heard you're a poet as well,
yeah?


2063
01:10:19.909 --> 01:10:21.428
- Yeah yeah yeah.

2064
01:10:21.463 --> 01:10:22.326
- [Conrad] Yeah, very nice.

2065
01:10:22.360 --> 01:10:23.189
- I mean, that was a,

2066
01:10:23.223 --> 01:10:25.605
yeah, there, at the time,
I was...


2067
01:10:25.639 --> 01:10:26.813
I was doing poetry.

2068
01:10:26.847 --> 01:10:27.641
- [Conrad] I would love to
hear some.


2069
01:10:27.676 --> 01:10:28.573
- Yeah, Bernie, do some!

2070
01:10:28.608 --> 01:10:29.609
Oh, I didn't bring it,
if I did, though,


2071
01:10:29.643 --> 01:10:30.541
it's very much like yours.

2072
01:10:30.575 --> 01:10:31.680
It's very sensual and sexual
and uh...


2073
01:10:31.714 --> 01:10:33.647
- He is everything you told me
about.


2074
01:10:33.682 --> 01:10:34.476
- [Zelda] Isn't he a gas?

2075
01:10:34.510 --> 01:10:35.718
- Yeah.

2076
01:10:35.753 --> 01:10:36.719
- [Bernard] Yeah, but I did
a lot of slams back then...


2077
01:10:36.754 --> 01:10:37.582
- I love this guy.

2078
01:10:37.617 --> 01:10:38.618
- And open mic kinda things.

2079
01:10:38.652 --> 01:10:40.378
- [Conrad] Very good.

2080
01:10:40.413 --> 01:10:41.241
- Yeah.

2081
01:10:43.519 --> 01:10:44.658
- Why do you want to know?

2082
01:10:44.693 --> 01:10:45.590
- [Man] I'll tell you how
much I make.


2083
01:10:45.625 --> 01:10:46.695
- I'm not interested.

2084
01:10:46.729 --> 01:10:47.868
- Why, you think you make more?

2085
01:10:47.903 --> 01:10:49.318
- [Woman] Is that a turn-off?

2086
01:10:49.353 --> 01:10:51.907
- You are suffering
from a serious illness!


2087
01:10:51.941 --> 01:10:53.322
- It's a turn-on.

2088
01:10:53.357 --> 01:10:54.358
- [Woman] For a woman
to make more?


2089
01:10:54.392 --> 01:10:56.187
- Yeah, but I doubt if
you make more than I do.


2090
01:10:56.222 --> 01:10:57.015
- [Woman] Really?

2091
01:10:57.050 --> 01:10:57.982
What do you do?

2092
01:10:58.016 --> 01:10:58.983
You're dressed like a
government stiff.


2093
01:10:59.017 --> 01:10:59.984
There are people plotting
to kill us!


2094
01:11:00.018 --> 01:11:01.296
And this is the conversation
you want to have


2095
01:11:01.330 --> 01:11:02.711
milliseconds before
[imitates explosion]?


2096
01:11:02.745 --> 01:11:04.057
- [Woman] DMV?

2097
01:11:04.091 --> 01:11:05.023
- I'm in insurance.

2098
01:11:05.058 --> 01:11:06.162
What about you?

2099
01:11:06.197 --> 01:11:06.991
- Oh, this is degrading.

2100
01:11:07.025 --> 01:11:07.888
- [Woman] I'm an attorney.

2101
01:11:07.923 --> 01:11:09.718
- Christ, I'll bet you do
make more.


2102
01:11:09.752 --> 01:11:10.684
- [Woman] Public defender.

2103
01:11:10.719 --> 01:11:11.892
- Oh, no, I probably do
make more.


2104
01:11:11.927 --> 01:11:14.309
- "Do you wanna fuck?"

2105
01:11:14.343 --> 01:11:16.311
Let's just get to that.

2106
01:11:16.345 --> 01:11:18.278
"Do you want to fuck?"

2107
01:11:18.313 --> 01:11:19.555
- [Woman] My clients, though.

2108
01:11:19.590 --> 01:11:20.625
Them, too.

2109
01:11:20.660 --> 01:11:22.386
It's the judges, other lawyers,

2110
01:11:22.420 --> 01:11:23.628
it's just not what I'm used to.

2111
01:11:23.663 --> 01:11:25.596
So I'm going into corporate law.

2112
01:11:25.630 --> 01:11:27.011
- Christ, you'll clean up.

2113
01:11:27.045 --> 01:11:28.184
- [Woman] I expect to.

2114
01:11:28.219 --> 01:11:29.013
Otherwise...

2115
01:11:29.047 --> 01:11:30.186
- You live alone?

2116
01:11:30.221 --> 01:11:31.015
- Bullshit!

2117
01:11:31.049 --> 01:11:31.843
- [Woman] No.

2118
01:11:31.878 --> 01:11:32.810
- You don't?
- Bullshit!


2119
01:11:32.844 --> 01:11:33.983
- [Woman] Who can afford to
live alone?


2120
01:11:34.018 --> 01:11:36.814
- Where are my contemporaries?

2121
01:11:36.848 --> 01:11:38.471
I live in a world without peers.

2122
01:11:38.505 --> 01:11:39.575
Where are my peers?

2123
01:11:39.610 --> 01:11:40.404
They are married,

2124
01:11:40.438 --> 01:11:41.543
with grown children...

2125
01:11:41.577 --> 01:11:42.716
- I don't live alone either.

2126
01:11:42.751 --> 01:11:44.649
- Whom I sleep with.

2127
01:11:44.684 --> 01:11:45.961
- [Woman] I've got
three roommates.


2128
01:11:45.995 --> 01:11:47.134
How many do you have?

2129
01:11:47.169 --> 01:11:47.963
- Roommates?

2130
01:11:47.997 --> 01:11:48.791
- [Woman] Yeah.

2131
01:11:48.826 --> 01:11:49.827
- One.

2132
01:11:49.861 --> 01:11:51.380
- I've lost the strength
to be as shallow at 49


2133
01:11:51.415 --> 01:11:53.002
as I was at 24.

2134
01:11:53.037 --> 01:11:54.210
- [Woman] One?

2135
01:11:55.177 --> 01:11:56.420
Oh.

2136
01:11:56.454 --> 01:11:57.766
You're married, right?

2137
01:11:57.800 --> 01:11:58.974
- In a way.

2138
01:11:59.008 --> 01:11:59.802
- [Woman] Separated?

2139
01:11:59.837 --> 01:12:00.700
- Practically.

2140
01:12:00.734 --> 01:12:01.666
- [Woman] But you haven't moved
out yet?


2141
01:12:01.701 --> 01:12:02.909
- I'm as good as moved out.

2142
01:12:02.943 --> 01:12:03.979
I'm just not a loner, you know?

2143
01:12:04.013 --> 01:12:05.912
I'm not good by myself.

2144
01:12:05.946 --> 01:12:06.775
- [Woman] You should get used
to it.


2145
01:12:06.809 --> 01:12:08.949
- What is wrong with
this picture?


2146
01:12:08.984 --> 01:12:09.847
- [Woman] So?

2147
01:12:09.881 --> 01:12:10.606
- Just waiting to meet the
right girl


2148
01:12:10.641 --> 01:12:11.711
and then...

2149
01:12:11.745 --> 01:12:12.574
- [Woman] Then you'll move out?

2150
01:12:12.608 --> 01:12:14.058
- What's to keep me?

2151
01:12:14.092 --> 01:12:15.370
- [Woman] Being such a tool.

2152
01:12:15.404 --> 01:12:16.923
- I'm still in it.

2153
01:12:22.411 --> 01:12:26.346
[train whistle; trucks idling]
- [Driver] It's been an hour,
chief.


2154
01:12:26.381 --> 01:12:27.174
- No problem.

2155

Later, man.

Still a midnight worker,
eh, Marty?


2158
01:12:57.308 --> 01:13:00.518
- You're supposed to be dead,
you shit!


2159
01:13:02.520 --> 01:13:03.866
Did you ever talk to her, huh?

2160
01:13:03.901 --> 01:13:04.729
Just once?

2161
01:13:07.525 --> 01:13:10.804
Just once in five years, huh,
you shit?


2162
01:13:12.944 --> 01:13:15.533
Mama thought you were dead.

2163
01:13:15.568 --> 01:13:17.466
- Mama hated me, Marty.

2164
01:13:22.057 --> 01:13:24.853
- Of course she hated you,
you shit.


2165
01:13:24.887 --> 01:13:26.579
Everybody hated you.

2166
01:13:29.616 --> 01:13:31.066
You had more than all of us

2167
01:13:31.100 --> 01:13:35.691
and you've done nothing with
your life but hurt people.


2168
01:13:37.486 --> 01:13:39.868
I wanted to be like you.

2169
01:13:39.902 --> 01:13:40.696
I imitated you.

2170
01:13:40.731 --> 01:13:41.801
Did you know that?

2171
01:13:41.835 --> 01:13:43.561
I imitated the way
that you walked


2172
01:13:43.596 --> 01:13:46.599
and how you talked and,
and I wanted to be you,


2173
01:13:46.633 --> 01:13:48.739
so I imitated you.

2174
01:13:48.773 --> 01:13:50.430
You're my fucking
little brother,


2175
01:13:50.465 --> 01:13:52.777
and I wanted to be like you!

2176
01:13:55.124 --> 01:13:57.920
You've had nothing but
contempt for all of us.


2177
01:13:57.955 --> 01:13:59.888
Where do you get off, huh?

2178
01:13:59.922 --> 01:14:00.716
Jesus!

2179
01:14:00.751 --> 01:14:01.579
Fuck you!

2180
01:14:04.824 --> 01:14:06.412
You should be dead.

2181
01:14:07.723 --> 01:14:09.449
Where do you get off?

2182
01:14:10.933 --> 01:14:12.866
By rights, you're dead.

[clearing throat]

2184
01:14:27.709 --> 01:14:31.229
- You, uh, remember my little
girl, Zelda?


2185
01:14:32.472 --> 01:14:34.129
- Yes.

2186
01:14:34.163 --> 01:14:36.234
- Little Zelda's all grown up.

2187
01:14:36.269 --> 01:14:37.097
- Good.

2188
01:14:38.271 --> 01:14:39.099
She, um...

2189
01:14:41.964 --> 01:14:44.519
She wants to do greeting cards.

2190
01:14:47.522 --> 01:14:50.248
I figured you could
use the work.

[uplifting music]

Hi.

2194
01:15:15.066 --> 01:15:17.344
Yeah, I just started
running again.


2195
01:15:17.379 --> 01:15:20.037
I stopped because I was
thinking too much, y'know.


2196
01:15:20.071 --> 01:15:22.418
I was always getting
lost in my head,


2197
01:15:22.453 --> 01:15:24.835
and I don't need another
reason to be there, y'know?


2198
01:15:24.869 --> 01:15:26.319
I should get ear buds.

2199
01:15:26.353 --> 01:15:28.873
They say listening to music
will keep you out of your head.


2200
01:15:28.908 --> 01:15:30.530
I see you don't wear any.

2201
01:15:30.565 --> 01:15:31.600
I noticed you don't have them.

2202
01:15:31.635 --> 01:15:35.328
Maybe you don't have
the same problem as me.


2203
01:15:40.126 --> 01:15:41.610
Will you marry me?

2204

not answering your cell.

Listen, I know I gave

01:18:57.254 --> 01:18:59.049
- [Conrad] So, Marty, my
man, the key is to seduce


2277
01:18:59.083 --> 01:19:00.326
the marketplace upwards.

2278
01:19:00.360 --> 01:19:02.915
Y'know, leverage
brick-and-mortar
into the transmedia space


2279
01:19:02.949 --> 01:19:05.572
all while maintaining an
authentic brand identity.


2280
01:19:05.607 --> 01:19:07.954
Conrad thinks I worry too
much about selling out.


2281
01:19:07.989 --> 01:19:09.059
- [Conrad] You do.

2282
01:19:09.093 --> 01:19:10.819
- Well, I, I, I think that
the stores are thrilled


2283
01:19:10.854 --> 01:19:12.407
that this is printed on hemp.

2284
01:19:12.441 --> 01:19:15.306
They just love it thanks to
the Mayor of Colorado here.


2285
01:19:15.341 --> 01:19:16.791
But you don't have anything to
worry about


2286
01:19:16.825 --> 01:19:18.378
these are all terrific.

2287
01:19:18.413 --> 01:19:20.070
- The cards, they just
drive eyeballs to the site,


2288
01:19:20.104 --> 01:19:21.968
site to the app,
app to online sales.


2289
01:19:22.003 --> 01:19:23.798
See, the medium doesn't
define the integrity


2290
01:19:23.832 --> 01:19:25.696
of the artist, 'cause
the true artist knows


2291
01:19:25.731 --> 01:19:28.078
how to create with
whatever's at his fingertips.


2292
01:19:28.112 --> 01:19:30.287
Our aim is to maximize
the marketplace,


2293
01:19:30.321 --> 01:19:32.358
not compromise our integrity.

2294
01:19:32.392 --> 01:19:33.359
Take it down, yeah?

2295
01:19:33.393 --> 01:19:35.292
- I don't understand a word
you're saying.


2296
01:19:35.326 --> 01:19:36.189
- These are very different.

2297
01:19:36.224 --> 01:19:37.225
That's what I like about them.

2298
01:19:37.259 --> 01:19:38.191
- [Huey] I dig it.

2299
01:19:38.226 --> 01:19:39.089
- [Conrad] It's generational,
my friend.


2300
01:19:39.123 --> 01:19:40.262
- [Marty] I, I understand that,
but I...


2301
01:19:40.297 --> 01:19:41.263
- [Aggie] So bizarre.

2302
01:19:41.298 --> 01:19:42.920
- Well, this is exactly why
we've already


2303
01:19:42.955 --> 01:19:46.096
started crowd-funding for
the graphic novel, as well.


2304
01:19:46.130 --> 01:19:47.614
- Gutenberg, baby, Gutenberg.

2305
01:19:47.649 --> 01:19:50.825
It begins and it ends
with the printed page.


2306
01:19:50.859 --> 01:19:53.103
You see, when the sustainable
becomes artisanal,


2307
01:19:53.137 --> 01:19:56.244
then the analog becomes tactile,
eh?


2308
01:19:56.278 --> 01:19:59.523
Hold on to life, lover,
and don't ever let it go.


2309
01:19:59.557 --> 01:20:00.351
- Okay.

2310
01:20:00.386 --> 01:20:01.180
Yeah.

2311
01:20:01.214 --> 01:20:02.008
Excuse me.

2312
01:20:02.043 --> 01:20:03.009
- [Conrad] Ciao, baby.

2313
01:20:03.044 --> 01:20:03.907
- Y'know, obviously, none of
this is gonna


2314
01:20:03.941 --> 01:20:04.804
be at the expense of the
greeting cards.


2315
01:20:04.839 --> 01:20:06.081
That's what gave us our start,
y'know,


2316
01:20:06.116 --> 01:20:07.945
But I just think having a
graphic novel


2317
01:20:07.980 --> 01:20:09.360
could just build up the brand.

2318
01:20:09.395 --> 01:20:11.052
- Just a shot of anything,
it doesn't matter.


2319
01:20:11.086 --> 01:20:14.538
- [Conrad] Absolutely brilliant.
- [Aggie] It's hilarious,
hilarious!


2320
01:20:14.572 --> 01:20:15.504
- You okay?

2321
01:20:17.299 --> 01:20:19.301
- I'm barely holding on.

2322
01:20:22.718 --> 01:20:25.480
You're back in business.

2323
01:20:25.514 --> 01:20:27.793
Your wife and your daughter.

2324
01:20:29.518 --> 01:20:32.073
- Ah, the hipster scene is dead,
man.


2325
01:20:32.107 --> 01:20:32.936
La Boheme.

2326
01:20:34.627 --> 01:20:37.941
Shit, everything your mama
told you about sex is true.


2327
01:20:37.975 --> 01:20:39.356
Take it down.

2328
01:20:39.390 --> 01:20:40.184
Take it down...

2329
01:20:40.219 --> 01:20:41.013
- Just stop, Huey.

2330
01:20:41.047 --> 01:20:42.635
Just stop.

2331
01:20:42.669 --> 01:20:44.982
God, you're exhausting.

2332
01:20:45.017 --> 01:20:46.812
You know that, right?

2333
01:20:48.883 --> 01:20:50.712
You have exhausted me.

2334
01:20:55.821 --> 01:20:57.098
Number one, I'm a schmuck.

2335
01:20:57.132 --> 01:20:58.685
Number two, I apologize.

2336
01:20:58.720 --> 01:20:59.997
Number three, I'm a schmuck.

2337
01:21:00.032 --> 01:21:00.860
Number four, I'm a schmuck.

2338
01:21:00.895 --> 01:21:03.518
Number five, I'm a schmuck.

2339
01:21:03.552 --> 01:21:05.278
"A transitional figure,"
that's what she called me.


2340
01:21:05.313 --> 01:21:06.970
Can you believe that?

2341
01:21:07.004 --> 01:21:10.490
I just, I just don't want
to get old, Roz.


2342
01:21:10.525 --> 01:21:12.734
Why is that so awful?

2343
01:21:12.768 --> 01:21:14.598
- I knew you when
you were young.


2344
01:21:14.632 --> 01:21:16.220
- Oh, God, oh shit.

2345
01:21:17.221 --> 01:21:19.741
Shit, that was awful!

2346
01:21:19.775 --> 01:21:20.569
That was awful, wasn't it?

2347
01:21:20.604 --> 01:21:22.848
It was awful being young!

2348
01:21:22.882 --> 01:21:24.884
[sighs]

2349
01:21:24.919 --> 01:21:28.301
Am I a transitional figure in
your life?


2350
01:21:28.336 --> 01:21:30.717
- You are a schmuck.

2351
01:21:30.752 --> 01:21:33.030
I'm a transitional figure in
your life.


2352
01:21:33.065 --> 01:21:33.928
- Nooo!

2353
01:21:33.962 --> 01:21:34.894
No.

2354
01:21:34.929 --> 01:21:35.722
C'mon...

2355
01:21:35.757 --> 01:21:36.551
- Do you want me to say it?

2356
01:21:36.585 --> 01:21:37.759
- No!

2357
01:21:37.793 --> 01:21:38.933
- You're my Zelda.

2358
01:21:38.967 --> 01:21:41.314
- Where did you hear this?

2359
01:21:41.349 --> 01:21:43.075
- But there is a saving grace.

2360
01:21:43.109 --> 01:21:44.421
- Yes, please.

2361
01:21:44.455 --> 01:21:45.284
Please.

2362
01:21:47.700 --> 01:21:52.187
- You are also a transitional
figure in your own life.


2363
01:21:57.986 --> 01:22:00.230
[groans]

2364
01:22:00.264 --> 01:22:01.610
- So, the irony is I
screw around


2365
01:22:01.645 --> 01:22:03.509
for the fear of my
own mortality,


2366
01:22:03.543 --> 01:22:04.372
and now,

2367
01:22:09.480 --> 01:22:10.309
and now,

2368
01:22:12.207 --> 01:22:13.036
and now.

2369
01:22:13.968 --> 01:22:16.591
- That is the irony, all right.

2370
01:22:20.560 --> 01:22:21.561
- I'm sorry.

2371
01:22:23.529 --> 01:22:24.702
I'm a schmuck.

2372
01:22:31.261 --> 01:22:32.710
But I look young.

2373

[laughing]

2374
01:22:35.403 --> 01:22:36.231
Young-ish?

[knocking]

2377
01:22:41.029 --> 01:22:41.857
- Hey!

2378
01:22:41.892 --> 01:22:43.135
- Oh my God.

2379
01:22:43.169 --> 01:22:44.584
What?

2380
01:22:44.619 --> 01:22:45.827
- I just wanted to come
by and let you to know


2381
01:22:45.861 --> 01:22:47.242
I'm not mad at you.

2382
01:22:47.277 --> 01:22:48.209
- Mad at me?

2383
01:22:48.243 --> 01:22:49.175
Why?

2384
01:22:49.210 --> 01:22:51.453
- You called me exhausting.

2385
01:22:53.007 --> 01:22:56.527
Hey, uh, you ever been to
St. Thomas?


2386
01:22:56.562 --> 01:22:57.494
- No.

2387
01:22:57.528 --> 01:22:59.151
Why?

2388
01:22:59.185 --> 01:23:00.014
- Here.

2389
01:23:01.808 --> 01:23:02.982
I just don't want you to be mad
at me for


2390
01:23:03.017 --> 01:23:04.501
the next 25 years.

2391
01:23:06.365 --> 01:23:07.469
See you soon?

[Caribbean music]

2393
01:23:17.100 --> 01:23:20.241
- [Announcer] Welcome
to Cyril E. King Airport


2394
01:23:20.275 --> 01:23:21.725
in St. Thomas in the
US Virgin Islands.


2395
01:23:21.759 --> 01:23:22.864
- [Zelda] Is it posting?

2396
01:23:22.898 --> 01:23:24.003
- [Conrad] No, it's not
going to post.


2397
01:23:24.038 --> 01:23:25.349
I'm recording now so we
can have it...


2398
01:23:25.384 --> 01:23:27.213
- Well, we can't just record
it now and post it later,


2399
01:23:27.248 --> 01:23:28.214
that's not authentic...

2400
01:23:28.249 --> 01:23:29.043
Where are the bags?

2401
01:23:29.077 --> 01:23:30.113
- Uh, up ahead.

2402
01:23:30.147 --> 01:23:31.355
- Can you believe we're here?

2403
01:23:31.390 --> 01:23:32.253
- As a matter of fact...

2404
01:23:32.287 --> 01:23:34.876
- It's so post-colonial.

2405
01:23:34.910 --> 01:23:36.878
Admit it, you were never
really attracted to Huey.


2406
01:23:36.912 --> 01:23:38.190
Just admit it, just admit it!

2407
01:23:38.224 --> 01:23:39.501
Ow!

2408
01:23:39.536 --> 01:23:42.125
- Uh, sweetie,
where are the bags?


2409
01:23:42.159 --> 01:23:43.022
- They're on the shuttle,
remember?


2410
01:23:43.057 --> 01:23:43.885
- Ah, yes!

2411
01:23:45.197 --> 01:23:48.372
Hey, I just wanna let you
know, I am so proud of you!


2412
01:23:48.407 --> 01:23:49.339
- Is this your way of telling me

2413
01:23:49.373 --> 01:23:50.305
that you're gonna leave again?

2414
01:23:50.340 --> 01:23:51.134
- No!

2415
01:23:51.168 --> 01:23:52.169
- We'll see.

2416
01:23:55.138 --> 01:23:56.242
- This is nice, huh?

2417
01:23:56.277 --> 01:23:57.105
- Yeah, this it's nice.

2418
01:23:57.140 --> 01:23:58.451
Thanks for the tickets,
by the way.


2419
01:23:58.486 --> 01:24:00.212
- Thanks for coming.

2420
01:24:00.246 --> 01:24:04.768
Y'know, I've been thinking,
uh, maybe I'll write a book!


2421
01:24:04.802 --> 01:24:06.321
- About what?

2422
01:24:06.356 --> 01:24:07.253
- Me!

2423
01:24:07.288 --> 01:24:09.186
- Oh, God, no!

2424
01:24:09.221 --> 01:24:12.189
No, don't ever, ever do that!

2425
01:24:12.224 --> 01:24:13.225
- We'll see!

Mona!

- Who's Mona?

2429
01:24:22.130 --> 01:24:23.476
- She's an artist.

2430
01:24:23.511 --> 01:24:24.512
- An artist?

2431
01:24:24.546 --> 01:24:25.375
Jesus!

2432
01:24:25.409 --> 01:24:26.548
- Parsons.

2433
01:24:26.583 --> 01:24:28.033
- How tall is she?

2434
01:24:28.067 --> 01:24:29.344
Does she put out?

2435
01:24:29.379 --> 01:24:31.105
