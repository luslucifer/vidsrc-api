1
00:25:05.654 --> 00:25:12.242
I open the Congress
of the Sixth Party Day...


2
00:25:12.410 --> 00:25:16.455
in respectful public memory of...

3
00:25:16.623 --> 00:25:22.127
General Field Marshal
and Reich President von Hindenburg...


4
00:25:22.295 --> 00:25:27.216
who has passed into eternity.

5
00:25:28.218 --> 00:25:31.929
The General Field Marshal

6
00:25:32.097 --> 00:25:36.600
is remembered as the first soldier
of the Great War,


7
00:25:36.768 --> 00:25:42.815
and thoughts as well
to our fallen comrades.


8
00:25:45.485 --> 00:25:51.198
I greet the high representatives
of foreign states...


9
00:25:51.366 --> 00:25:56.286
who by their presence are participating
in this day for their political parties.


10
00:25:57.789 --> 00:26:02.543
In sincere friendship, the greeting
of the Movement is extended...


11
00:26:02.711 --> 00:26:05.462
especially to the representatives
of the Armed Forces here...


12
00:26:05.630 --> 00:26:07.798
now under the command
of the Fuhrer.


13
00:26:19.477 --> 00:26:24.064
Around you stand the flags
and standards


14
00:26:24.232 --> 00:26:27.234
of National Socialism.

15
00:26:27.402 --> 00:26:31.321
Only when they are threadbare,

16
00:26:31.489 --> 00:26:35.075
will the people
be able to understand,


17
00:26:35.243 --> 00:26:41.039
in hindsight,
the greatness of our time,


18
00:26:41.207 --> 00:26:45.836
because of what you, my Fuhrer,
mean to Germany.


19
00:27:00.101 --> 00:27:02.978
You are Germany.

20
00:27:03.146 --> 00:27:06.398
When you act, the Nation acts.

21
00:27:06.566 --> 00:27:10.569
When you judge,
the People judge.


22
00:27:27.003 --> 00:27:30.506
Our thanks is the vow
to stand with you...


23
00:27:30.673 --> 00:27:34.760
in good days and bad...

24
00:27:34.928 --> 00:27:38.180
come what may.

25
00:27:51.986 --> 00:27:54.738
Thanks to your leadership,

26
00:27:54.906 --> 00:28:00.285
Germany will be attainable
as the homeland.


27
00:28:03.832 --> 00:28:08.335
Homeland
for all Germans in the world.


28
00:28:15.301 --> 00:28:19.638
To us, you were
the guarantor of victory.


29
00:28:19.806 --> 00:28:24.476
To us, you are
the guarantor of peace.


30
00:28:53.047 --> 00:28:56.925
No revolution
that seems to be permanent...


31
00:28:57.093 --> 00:29:01.013
can lead to anything other
than complete anarchy.


32
00:29:01.180 --> 00:29:04.516
So the world will not live at war.

33
00:29:04.684 --> 00:29:08.979
So also the People
do not live on revolution.


34
00:29:09.147 --> 00:29:16.528
Nothing on this Earth that has lasted
for thousands of years...


35
00:29:16.696 --> 00:29:21.533
was assembled in mere decades.

36
00:29:21.701 --> 00:29:28.040
The largest tree also has
the longest period of growth.


37
00:29:28.207 --> 00:29:31.376
What braves the centuries...

38
00:29:31.544 --> 00:29:35.380
will also be strong
through the centuries.


39
00:29:40.720 --> 00:29:45.390
It is our unshakable belief
in ourselves...


40
00:29:45.558 --> 00:29:49.895
that is our hope
for the youth...


41
00:29:50.063 --> 00:29:54.107
to carry on the work
which has been put


42
00:29:54.275 --> 00:29:58.070
before them
in the stormy years...


43
00:29:58.237 --> 00:30:03.575
of the revolt of 1918 in Munich...

44
00:30:03.743 --> 00:30:10.248
and which is already part
of the entire German nation's history.


45
00:30:15.505 --> 00:30:18.173
Truth is the foundation...

46
00:30:18.341 --> 00:30:22.260
on which the power of the press
stands in the world.


47
00:30:22.428 --> 00:30:25.430
And that it reports the truth
about Germany...


48
00:30:25.598 --> 00:30:31.436
is the only demand that we place
on the foreign press.


49
00:30:36.567 --> 00:30:41.947
As I speak, work on the Reich Autobahn
has begun at 51 locations.


50
00:30:42.115 --> 00:30:45.701
Although this work
is in its early stage...


51
00:30:45.868 --> 00:30:49.955
today there are already

52
00:30:50.123 --> 00:30:54.793
and another 100,000...

53
00:30:54.961 --> 00:30:59.965
engaged in the work
of allied industries.


54
00:31:05.138 --> 00:31:09.141
Wherever we look,
all around there is building...


55
00:31:09.308 --> 00:31:13.854
and new creations...

56
00:31:14.022 --> 00:31:17.441
and activity and life...

57
00:31:17.608 --> 00:31:21.653
which will continue into the future.

58
00:31:25.366 --> 00:31:29.953
Maintaining the health of our farmers
is the primary foundation...


59
00:31:30.121 --> 00:31:33.123
for the prosperity of industry...

60
00:31:33.291 --> 00:31:37.961
for German business
and for foreign exports.


61
00:31:42.633 --> 00:31:49.431
A people that does not protect
the purity of its race goes to seed.


62
00:31:53.978 --> 00:31:58.982
All our work must be dictated
by a single thought... -


63
00:31:59.150 --> 00:32:01.985
that the German worker...

64
00:32:02.153 --> 00:32:09.159
be made an upright, proud
and equally entitled national comrade.


65
00:32:12.622 --> 00:32:16.500
As the Leader
of the German legal service...


66
00:32:16.667 --> 00:32:21.671
I can say that, clearly, the basis
of the National Socialist State...


67
00:32:21.839 --> 00:32:24.674
is the National Socialist Law Code.

68
00:32:24.842 --> 00:32:30.472
And for us, our highest Leader
is also the highest judge.


69
00:32:30.640 --> 00:32:35.644
We know how sacred
the principles


70
00:32:35.812 --> 00:32:40.357
of these laws
are to our Fuhrer.


71
00:32:40.525 --> 00:32:45.028
These Reich laws can assure you,
national comrades...


72
00:32:45.196 --> 00:32:47.614
that your life and existence are safe...

73
00:32:47.782 --> 00:32:51.701
in this National Socialist State
of order, freedom, and law.


74
00:33:01.546 --> 00:33:07.259
May the bright flame of our enthusiasm
never be extinguished.


75
00:33:07.426 --> 00:33:11.096
It alone gives light and warmth...

76
00:33:11.264 --> 00:33:15.433
to the creative art
of modern political propaganda.


77
00:33:15.601 --> 00:33:19.938
This comes
from the depths of the people...


78
00:33:20.106 --> 00:33:24.276
and from these depths of the people...

79
00:33:24.443 --> 00:33:30.448
it must always again
find its roots and its strength.


80
00:33:30.616 --> 00:33:37.289
It may be good to possess power
based on strength...


81
00:33:37.456 --> 00:33:41.084
but it is better to win

82
00:33:41.252 --> 00:33:46.631
and hold the heart of a people.

83
00:33:50.136 --> 00:33:55.473
Today, the German people
are spiritually and soulfully ready...


84
00:33:55.641 --> 00:34:00.979
to undertake their obligation
in the National Tabor Service.


85
00:34:07.153 --> 00:34:10.989
We have the Fuhrer's orders.

86
00:34:47.026 --> 00:34:53.323
I wish to present 52,000 RAD
men for your inspection.


87
00:34:55.701 --> 00:34:57.869
Hail, Men of the Tabor Service.

88
00:34:58.037 --> 00:35:00.121
Hail, my Fuhrer.

89
00:35:02.708 --> 00:35:05.710
Shoulder spades.

90
00:35:05.878 --> 00:35:09.047
Spades at ease.

91
00:35:18.349 --> 00:35:21.726
Here we stand.

92
00:35:21.894 --> 00:35:24.479
We are ready...

93
00:35:24.647 --> 00:35:28.984
to carry Germany into a new era.

94
00:35:29.151 --> 00:35:31.528
Germany.

95
00:35:31.696 --> 00:35:35.573
Comrade,
where do you come from?


96
00:35:35.741 --> 00:35:38.451
From Friesenland.

97
00:35:38.619 --> 00:35:39.995
And you, comrade?

98
00:35:40.162 --> 00:35:41.413
From Bavaria.

99
00:35:41.580 --> 00:35:43.164
And you?

100
00:35:43.332 --> 00:35:45.166
From Kaiserstuhl.

101
00:35:45.334 --> 00:35:48.712
- And you?
- From Pomerania.


102
00:35:48.879 --> 00:35:50.046
And from Konigsberg.

103
00:35:50.214 --> 00:35:51.798
From Silesia.

104
00:35:51.966 --> 00:35:53.591
From the sea-coast.

105
00:35:53.759 --> 00:35:56.511
From the Black Forest.

106
00:35:56.679 --> 00:35:59.431
- From Dresden.
- From the Danube.


107
00:35:59.598 --> 00:36:03.268
- From the Rhein.
- And from the Saar.


108
00:36:03.436 --> 00:36:05.603
One People.

109
00:36:05.771 --> 00:36:07.564
One Leader.

110
00:36:07.732 --> 00:36:08.940
One Reich.

111
00:36:09.108 --> 00:36:11.526
Germany.

112
00:36:11.694 --> 00:36:14.612
Today we work together...

113
00:36:15.614 --> 00:36:16.865
in the swamp.

114
00:36:17.033 --> 00:36:21.661
We work in the swamp.

115
00:36:21.829 --> 00:36:25.874
And in the sand.

116
00:36:26.042 --> 00:36:30.879
We dam the North Sea.

117
00:36:31.047 --> 00:36:35.592
We plant trees.

118
00:36:36.635 --> 00:36:37.969
We build roads...

119
00:36:38.137 --> 00:36:44.059
from town to town,
and city to city.


120
00:36:44.226 --> 00:36:47.062
We provide farmers
with new soils...


121
00:36:47.229 --> 00:36:54.444
forests and fields,
land and bread...


122
00:36:54.612 --> 00:36:56.696
for Germany.

123
00:37:41.575 --> 00:37:44.577
We didn't stand in the trenches.

124
00:37:44.745 --> 00:37:47.914
Nor were we
under the shell fire of grenades...


125
00:37:48.082 --> 00:37:51.709
and still, we are soldiers.

126
00:37:51.877 --> 00:37:54.421
- Sharpen the hammers...
- Axes.


127
00:37:54.588 --> 00:37:57.048
- Pick axes.
- And spades.


128
00:37:57.216 --> 00:38:01.052
We are the Reich's
young manhood.


129
00:38:01.220 --> 00:38:04.889
As once at Langemarck...

130
00:38:07.351 --> 00:38:10.186
at Tannenberg...

131
00:38:11.897 --> 00:38:14.566
before Luttich (Liege)...

132
00:38:17.236 --> 00:38:19.737
before Verdun...

133
00:38:20.739 --> 00:38:23.032
on the Somme...

134
00:38:27.621 --> 00:38:30.290
in Flanders...

135
00:38:31.542 --> 00:38:33.168
in the West...

136
00:38:33.335 --> 00:38:35.211
in the East...

137
00:38:35.379 --> 00:38:37.547
in the South...

138
00:38:39.091 --> 00:38:44.262
on land, on water,
and in the air.


139
00:38:48.267 --> 00:38:53.313
Comrades, who were shot
by the Red Front and reactionaries...


140
00:38:57.485 --> 00:39:00.111
you are not dead.

141
00:39:00.279 --> 00:39:05.700
You live in Germany.

142
00:39:12.833 --> 00:39:15.668
My Tabor Service men.

143
00:39:15.836 --> 00:39:22.759
For the first time you are presented
for review in this forum...


144
00:39:22.927 --> 00:39:29.557
before me and before
the German people.


145
00:39:29.725 --> 00:39:34.103
You represent a great idea...

146
00:39:34.271 --> 00:39:39.651
and we know that for millions
of our national comrades...


147
00:39:39.818 --> 00:39:44.822
physical lobar will no longer
be a divisive concept.


148
00:39:44.990 --> 00:39:48.576
But it will instead bind us together.
And, furthermore...


149
00:39:48.744 --> 00:39:54.165
no longer will it be the case
in Germany...


150
00:39:54.333 --> 00:39:58.461
that physical lobar will be seen
as anything less...


151
00:39:58.629 --> 00:40:02.507
than any other work.

152
00:40:02.675 --> 00:40:07.512
The whole nation passes
through your school.


153
00:40:07.680 --> 00:40:11.683
The time will come
when no German...


154
00:40:11.850 --> 00:40:17.355
can be admitted
into the community of the people...


155
00:40:17.523 --> 00:40:22.694
until he has first become a member
of your community.


156
00:40:22.861 --> 00:40:26.739
And you know that today
you are not only being seen...


157
00:40:26.907 --> 00:40:30.868
by the hundreds of thousands in Nuremberg,
but by all of Germany...


158
00:40:31.036 --> 00:40:35.540
which also sees you here
for the first time today.


159
00:40:36.875 --> 00:40:41.421
And I know
that just as you serve...


160
00:40:41.589 --> 00:40:45.216
this Germany proudly...

161
00:40:45.384 --> 00:40:52.307
today with proud joy all of Germany
will see its sons marching in you.


162
00:42:20.145 --> 00:42:25.566
Hail victory.
Hail victory. Hail victory.


163
00:42:27.152 --> 00:42:29.278
Comrades.

164
00:42:30.322 --> 00:42:37.370
Many of you here tonight knew me...

165
00:42:37.538 --> 00:42:40.707
as an SA man...

166
00:42:41.792 --> 00:42:45.420
marching in the rank and file...

167
00:42:45.587 --> 00:42:49.340
in the first years of the Movement.

168
00:42:49.508 --> 00:42:55.388
And party comrades,
just as I was an SA man then...


169
00:42:55.556 --> 00:42:59.225
so I am still an SA man today.

170
00:43:07.192 --> 00:43:12.780
We SA workers will always be true

171
00:43:12.948 --> 00:43:15.032
only to the Fuhrer...

172
00:43:15.200 --> 00:43:18.578
and fight for the Fuhrer.

173
00:48:06.033 --> 00:48:08.325
My comrades.

174
00:48:08.493 --> 00:48:12.788
We live again for this hour

175
00:48:12.956 --> 00:48:17.001
which makes
us proud and happy.


176
00:48:17.169 --> 00:48:24.258
According to your command,
my Fuhrer, a youth stands here...


177
00:48:24.426 --> 00:48:30.347
a youth that knows
neither class nor caste.


178
00:48:30.515 --> 00:48:37.229
The young generation of our people
follows after you.


179
00:48:37.397 --> 00:48:41.776
Just as you demonstrate

180
00:48:41.943 --> 00:48:44.987
the highest self-sacrifice
in this nation...


181
00:48:45.155 --> 00:48:49.325
so does this youth
wish to be selfless.


182
00:48:49.493 --> 00:48:53.746
Because you embody
the concept of fidelity for us...


183
00:48:53.914 --> 00:48:59.710
therefore we wish to be faithful.

184
00:48:59.878 --> 00:49:05.091
Adolf Hitler,
the Leader of German Youth, attention.


185
00:49:24.569 --> 00:49:26.946
My German Youth.

186
00:49:29.032 --> 00:49:34.495
After one year,
I can greet you again here.


187
00:49:34.663 --> 00:49:40.918
You standing here today
represent something...


188
00:49:41.086 --> 00:49:47.174
that is happening
all over Germany.


189
00:49:47.342 --> 00:49:53.514
And we want you,
German boys and girls...


190
00:49:55.433 --> 00:50:02.273
to absorb everything
that we wish for Germany.


191
00:50:02.440 --> 00:50:05.693
We want to be one people...

192
00:50:05.861 --> 00:50:12.366
and through you,
to become this people.


193
00:50:12.534 --> 00:50:16.370
We want a society
without class or rank.


194
00:50:16.538 --> 00:50:22.042
And you must not allow
these ideas to grow within you.


195
00:50:22.210 --> 00:50:26.297
We want to see one Reich.

196
00:50:26.464 --> 00:50:30.593
And you must
educate yourselves for this.


197
00:50:30.760 --> 00:50:34.930
We want this people
to be obedient...


198
00:50:35.098 --> 00:50:38.392
and you must
practice obedience in yourselves.


199
00:50:38.560 --> 00:50:42.730
We want this people
to be peace-loving...


200
00:50:42.898 --> 00:50:45.065
but at the same time
to be courageous.


201
00:50:45.233 --> 00:50:48.235
And you must, for that reason,
be both peace-loving...


202
00:51:06.922 --> 00:51:14.428
You must be
both peace-loving and strong.


203
00:51:24.272 --> 00:51:30.110
We want this people
not to become soft...


204
00:51:30.278 --> 00:51:33.656
but to become hard
and, therefore...


205
00:51:33.823 --> 00:51:39.203
you must steel yourselves
for this in your youth.


206
00:51:39.371 --> 00:51:43.749
You must learn sacrifice...

207
00:51:43.917 --> 00:51:50.214
and also never to collapse.

208
00:51:50.382 --> 00:51:53.717
Whatever we create today...

209
00:51:53.885 --> 00:51:56.971
whatever we do...

210
00:51:57.138 --> 00:51:59.473
will all pass away.

211
00:51:59.641 --> 00:52:02.768
But Germany will live on in you.

212
00:52:02.936 --> 00:52:06.981
And when we
can no longer hold...


213
00:52:07.148 --> 00:52:12.069
the flag that
we tore from nothing...


214
00:52:12.237 --> 00:52:15.447
you must hold it
firmly in your fists.


215
00:52:30.213 --> 00:52:32.923
And I know
that it cannot be any other way...


216
00:52:33.091 --> 00:52:35.592
as we bind ourselves together.

217
00:52:35.760 --> 00:52:42.349
For you are flesh of our flesh
and blood of our blood.


218
00:52:42.517 --> 00:52:44.727
The same spirit that governs us...

219
00:52:44.894 --> 00:52:48.022
burns in your young minds.

220
00:52:54.529 --> 00:53:01.285
And when the great columns
of our Movement...


221
00:53:01.453 --> 00:53:07.708
sweep through Germany today...

222
00:53:07.876 --> 00:53:13.839
then I know
that you will close ranks...


223
00:53:21.056 --> 00:53:24.058
for we know that in
front of us lies Germany,

224
00:53:24.225 --> 00:53:26.560
within us marches Germany

225
00:53:26.728 --> 00:53:30.064
and behind us comes Germany.

226
00:58:59.811 --> 00:59:04.564
A year ago...

227
00:59:05.733 --> 00:59:10.487
we met for the first time
on this field...


228
00:59:10.655 --> 00:59:17.869
the first general review
of political leaders...


229
00:59:18.037 --> 00:59:21.873
of the National Socialist Party.

230
00:59:22.041 --> 00:59:26.253
200,000 men have assembled here.

231
00:59:26.421 --> 00:59:33.760
They are not here
at the summons of their hearts alone...


232
00:59:33.928 --> 00:59:38.432
but also at the summons
of their loyalty.


233
00:59:48.693 --> 00:59:53.196
It was the great calamity
of our people...


234
00:59:53.364 --> 00:59:56.450
that drove us to the struggle...

235
00:59:56.617 --> 01:00:02.664
brought us together...

236
01:00:02.832 --> 01:00:06.126
and left us greater.

237
01:00:06.294 --> 01:00:09.796
Those who do not understand...

238
01:00:09.964 --> 01:00:14.801
have not experienced
the same calamities among their people.


239
01:00:21.642 --> 01:00:27.314
These things appear
enigmatic and mysterious...


240
01:00:27.482 --> 01:00:32.652
that hundreds of thousands
would be led to assemble...


241
01:00:32.820 --> 01:00:37.824
amidst calamity and passion.

242
01:00:37.992 --> 01:00:41.328
Others cannot understand...

243
01:00:41.496 --> 01:00:45.916
that this is not
an order of the state.


244
01:00:46.083 --> 01:00:49.169
They are deceiving themselves.

245
01:00:49.337 --> 01:00:53.340
The State does not order us.

246
01:00:53.508 --> 01:00:56.009
We order the State.

247
01:01:05.937 --> 01:01:10.524
The State did not create us.

248
01:01:10.691 --> 01:01:14.277
Rather we created our own State.

249
01:01:18.616 --> 01:01:23.203
No, the Movement lives...

250
01:01:23.371 --> 01:01:29.084
and it is grounded hard and fast.

251
01:01:29.252 --> 01:01:34.881
And as long as one of us
can draw a breath...


252
01:01:35.883 --> 01:01:40.804
he will give his strengths
to the Movement...


253
01:01:40.972 --> 01:01:47.811
just as it was in yesteryear.

254
01:01:47.979 --> 01:01:51.398
Then drum will join drum...

255
01:01:51.566 --> 01:01:53.567
flag will join flag...

256
01:01:53.734 --> 01:01:58.738
group will join group,
Gau to Gau...


257
01:01:58.906 --> 01:02:03.577
and after that,
this people, formerly divided...


258
01:02:03.744 --> 01:02:09.040
will follow these sacred columns
of the Nation.


259
01:02:17.925 --> 01:02:24.097
It would be an outrage
if we were to lose...


260
01:02:24.265 --> 01:02:28.935
what we have fought for...

261
01:02:29.103 --> 01:02:32.439
with so much lobar,
so much worry...


262
01:02:32.607 --> 01:02:36.276
so much sacrifice,
and so many privations.


263
01:02:52.251 --> 01:02:57.964
One cannot live faithfully
and give up...


264
01:02:58.132 --> 01:03:03.470
what has given meaning and purpose
to one's entire life.


265
01:03:03.638 --> 01:03:08.475
That would not be so...

266
01:03:08.643 --> 01:03:15.190
if it were not a cardinal command.

267
01:03:15.358 --> 01:03:21.655
And no earthly power
gave us that command.


268
01:03:21.822 --> 01:03:27.327
For the God, our God, who created
our people, gave us that command.


269
01:03:34.502 --> 01:03:40.423
So it is our vow this night...

270
01:03:40.591 --> 01:03:44.678
that each hour, on every day...

271
01:03:44.845 --> 01:03:48.848
to think only of Germany
of the People and Reich...


272
01:03:49.016 --> 01:03:53.186
and of our German nation.

273
01:03:53.354 --> 01:03:56.690
To the German people.
Hail victory. Hail victory. Hail victory.


274
01:11:23.220 --> 01:11:29.475
just as we have always
done our duty to you in the past...


275
01:11:29.643 --> 01:11:35.982
so too, in the future,
we await your orders alone.


276
01:11:36.150 --> 01:11:40.820
And we, comrades,
know only to obey...


277
01:11:40.988 --> 01:11:46.909
the orders of our Fuhrer...

278
01:11:47.077 --> 01:11:52.415
and to prove that we have remained
true to the Fuhrer.


279
01:11:52.583 --> 01:11:56.752
Our Fuhrer, Adolf Hitler.

280
01:11:56.920 --> 01:12:01.340
Hail victory. Hail victory.

281
01:12:07.764 --> 01:12:11.100
SA and SS Men:

282
01:12:14.188 --> 01:12:18.149
A few months ago...

283
01:12:18.317 --> 01:12:23.779
a dark shadow cast itself
across our Movement.


284
01:12:23.947 --> 01:12:29.285
The SA and other institutions
of the Party...


285
01:12:29.453 --> 01:12:35.875
had nothing whatever to do
with this shadow.


286
01:12:38.170 --> 01:12:45.343
They who would believe that a rift has
opened in the unity of the Movement...


287
01:12:45.511 --> 01:12:50.181
deceive themselves.

288
01:12:50.349 --> 01:12:56.062
It stands fast as this block here...

289
01:12:56.230 --> 01:13:01.150
and nothing in Germany

290
01:13:01.318 --> 01:13:03.903
will break it.

291
01:13:04.071 --> 01:13:08.407
And when anyone does harm

292
01:13:08.575 --> 01:13:10.743
to my SA,

293
01:13:10.911 --> 01:13:14.705
then the SA
will not be harmed.


294
01:13:14.873 --> 01:13:17.667
But those who do this harm...

295
01:13:17.834 --> 01:13:22.255
will injure only themselves.

296
01:13:31.265 --> 01:13:34.517
And only a fool...

297
01:13:34.685 --> 01:13:38.271
or a known liar...

298
01:13:38.438 --> 01:13:43.442
could think...

299
01:13:43.610 --> 01:13:48.990
that I would ever
disband an organisation...


300
01:13:49.157 --> 01:13:53.160
that took us so many years to build.

301
01:13:53.328 --> 01:13:55.121
No my comrades...

302
01:13:55.289 --> 01:14:01.794
we stand fast together
for our Germany...


303
01:14:01.962 --> 01:14:07.300
and we must stand fast together
for this Germany.


304
01:14:08.594 --> 01:14:12.138
And I hand to each of you
the new insignia...


305
01:14:12.306 --> 01:14:15.683
placing them with confidence...

306
01:14:15.851 --> 01:14:21.147
in the hands that I see as the most
trustworthy there are in Germany.


307
01:14:21.315 --> 01:14:23.816
For in the past...

308
01:14:23.984 --> 01:14:29.655
you have proved
your loyalty to me a thousand times.


309
01:14:29.823 --> 01:14:36.996
In the time to come, it cannot
and will not be any different.


310
01:14:47.174 --> 01:14:50.092
And so I greet you

311
01:14:50.260 --> 01:14:55.348
as my old, faithful
SA and SS men.


312
01:14:55.515 --> 01:15:02.313
- Hail victory.
- Hail. Hail. Hail.


313
01:38:50.074 --> 01:38:52.200
The Fuhrer speaks:

314
01:39:25.317 --> 01:39:31.489
The Sixth Party Day of the Movement
has come to an end.


315
01:39:31.657 --> 01:39:37.995
What appeared
as a show of political strength...


316
01:39:38.163 --> 01:39:41.582
for millions of Germans...

317
01:39:41.750 --> 01:39:45.169
outside of our ranks...

318
01:39:45.337 --> 01:39:48.714
For hundreds of thousands
of fighters...


319
01:39:48.882 --> 01:39:51.843
it was ultimately more.

320
01:39:52.010 --> 01:39:55.930
The great personal
and spiritual meeting...


321
01:39:56.098 --> 01:40:00.184
of the old fighters
and comrades in struggle.


322
01:40:00.352 --> 01:40:02.979
And, perhaps,
a cross section of you...


323
01:40:03.147 --> 01:40:08.234
despite the forced civility
of this review of our Party...


324
01:40:08.402 --> 01:40:12.488
will return with courageous hearts

325
01:40:12.656 --> 01:40:19.078
to the days in which it was difficult
to be a National Socialist.


326
01:40:25.586 --> 01:40:32.592
When our Party consisted
of only seven members...


327
01:40:32.759 --> 01:40:34.760
it already had two principles.

328
01:40:34.928 --> 01:40:40.099
First, it would be a Party
with a true ideology.


329
01:40:40.267 --> 01:40:44.187
And second, it would be,
uncompromisingly...


330
01:40:44.354 --> 01:40:48.608
the one and only power
in Germany.


331
01:40:59.995 --> 01:41:04.290
We had to remain in the minority,
because we mobilised...


332
01:41:04.458 --> 01:41:11.297
the most valuable elements of struggle
and sacrifice in the Nation...


333
01:41:11.465 --> 01:41:13.549
which have always been not
in the majority,


334
01:41:13.717 --> 01:41:16.802
but rather in the minority.

335
01:41:25.979 --> 01:41:32.652
And because these are the racially best
of the German nation...


336
01:41:32.819 --> 01:41:35.363
they can,
in the proudest self-esteem...


337
01:41:35.530 --> 01:41:38.991
claim the leadership
of the Reich and the people.


338
01:41:39.159 --> 01:41:42.662
The German people...

339
01:41:42.829 --> 01:41:46.916
have subordinated itself to
this leadership in ever-growing numbers.


340
01:41:58.011 --> 01:42:00.846
The German people are happy...

341
01:42:01.014 --> 01:42:05.184
in the knowledge
that a constantly changing vision...


342
01:42:05.352 --> 01:42:11.107
has been replaced by a fixed pole.

343
01:42:25.372 --> 01:42:30.167
Whoever feels that he is the carrier
of the best blood...


344
01:42:30.335 --> 01:42:36.257
and knowingly uses it
to attain the leadership...


345
01:42:36.425 --> 01:42:42.054
will never relinquish it.

346
01:42:56.486 --> 01:43:01.824
There is always a part of the people
who stand out as really active fighters...


347
01:43:01.992 --> 01:43:05.911
and more is expected from them...

348
01:43:06.079 --> 01:43:09.498
than from the millions of national
comrades in the general population.


349
01:43:09.666 --> 01:43:15.921
For them, it is not simply enough
to make the pledge, "I believe."


350
01:43:16.089 --> 01:43:18.883
But rather, the affirmation, "I fight."

351
01:43:37.778 --> 01:43:43.324
For all time to come, the Party will be
the source of Political Leadership...


352
01:43:43.492 --> 01:43:45.368
for the German people.

353
01:43:45.535 --> 01:43:50.623
It will in its teaching...

354
01:43:50.791 --> 01:43:54.126
and was ultimately, in its organisation,
hard as steel...


355
01:43:54.294 --> 01:43:57.630
flexible in its tactics
and adaptable in its entirety;


356
01:43:57.798 --> 01:44:02.134
yet it will be a training school
like a holy order for political leaders.


357
01:44:11.478 --> 01:44:14.021
It must be shown, however...

358
01:44:14.189 --> 01:44:18.359
that all upstanding Germans
become National Socialists.


359
01:44:18.527 --> 01:44:23.906
Only the best National Socialists,
however, are Party Comrades.


360
01:44:44.511 --> 01:44:49.723
Once, our enemies worried us...

361
01:44:49.891 --> 01:44:53.894
and persecuted us
and, from time to time...


362
01:44:54.062 --> 01:44:56.772
removed the lesser elements...

363
01:44:56.940 --> 01:45:00.693
from the Movement for us.

364
01:45:00.861 --> 01:45:05.114
Today, we must examine ourselves...

365
01:45:05.282 --> 01:45:08.159
and remove from our midst
the elements that have become bad...


366
01:45:16.418 --> 01:45:19.920
and therefore, do not belong with us.

367
01:45:26.428 --> 01:45:28.345
It is our wish and will...

368
01:45:28.513 --> 01:45:34.143
that this State and this Reich
last for a thousand years.


369
01:45:34.311 --> 01:45:37.104
We can be happy to know

370
01:45:37.272 --> 01:45:42.401
that this future
belongs entirely to us.


371
01:45:55.999 --> 01:45:59.752
When the older ones
among us falter...


372
01:45:59.920 --> 01:46:06.091
the youth will stiffen
and remain until their bodies decay.


373
01:46:25.695 --> 01:46:29.990
Only then,
if we in the Party...


374
01:46:30.158 --> 01:46:32.952
with our most obedient
dedication...


375
01:46:33.119 --> 01:46:35.621
become the highest
embodiment


376
01:46:35.789 --> 01:46:41.043
of National Socialist
thought and being...


377
01:46:41.211 --> 01:46:43.629
then the Party will materialise...

378
01:46:43.797 --> 01:46:46.924
into an eternal
and indestructible pillar


379
01:46:47.092 --> 01:46:49.843
of the German people and Reich.

380
01:46:50.011 --> 01:46:53.430
Then our glorious...

381
01:46:53.598 --> 01:46:56.976
and laudable Army...

382
01:46:57.143 --> 01:47:00.396
the old, proud standard-bearers
of our people...


383
01:47:00.564 --> 01:47:03.566
who are equally tradition-minded...

384
01:47:03.733 --> 01:47:06.318
will champion the Political
Leadership and the Party.


385
01:47:06.486 --> 01:47:12.491
And then these two institutions
will equally educate the German man...


386
01:47:12.659 --> 01:47:16.161
and, therefore, strengthen
and carry on their shoulders...


387
01:47:16.329 --> 01:47:19.415
the German State,
the German Reich.


388
01:47:32.554 --> 01:47:36.056
At this hour,
tens of thousands


389
01:47:36.224 --> 01:47:40.060
of our Party Comrades
are already leaving the City.


390
01:47:40.228 --> 01:47:44.857
While many of them relive
the meeting in their memories...


391
01:47:45.025 --> 01:47:49.862
still others are already planning
the next review.


392
01:47:50.030 --> 01:47:52.906
And again
the people come and go


393
01:47:53.074 --> 01:47:58.329
and they will be engrossed
anew and happy and inspired,


394
01:47:58.496 --> 01:48:00.956
for the Idea
and the Movement


395
01:48:01.124 --> 01:48:03.542
live on in our people...

396
01:48:03.710 --> 01:48:06.712
and with the Movement
are a symbol of eternity.


397
01:48:06.880 --> 01:48:09.548
Long live
the National Socialist Movement.


398
01:48:09.716 --> 01:48:11.884
Long live Germany.

399
01:49:11.778 --> 01:49:15.614
The Party is Hitler.

400
01:49:15.782 --> 01:49:19.868
But Hitler is Germany,
as Germany is Hitler.


401
01:49:20.036 --> 01:49:24.707
Hitler. Hail victory.
Hail victory.


402
01:49:32.173 --> 01:49:36.301
- Raise the banner -

403
01:49:36.469 --> 01:49:42.725
- The columns
are closed tightly -


404
01:49:42.892 --> 01:49:52.693
- The SA marches
with a peaceful strong step -


405
01:49:53.653 --> 01:50:03.653
- Comrades shot by the Red Front
and the Reactionaries -


406
01:50:04.914 --> 01:50:13.922
- March in spirit
together in our columns -


407
01:50:15.175 --> 01:50:24.850
- Comrades shot by the Red Front
and the Reactionaries -


408
01:50:26.519 --> 01:50:35.861
- March in spirit together
in our columns. -
