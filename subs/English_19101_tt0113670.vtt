00:00:21.962 --> 00:00:24.364
A very long time ago,

2
00:00:24.365 --> 00:00:27.234
there lived a beautiful Princess

3
00:00:27.235 --> 00:00:30.570
in a mystical land known as…

4
00:00:30.571 --> 00:00:32.306
India.

5
00:00:48.222 --> 00:00:52.259
She was married
to the handsome Prince Rama,


6
00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.395
who had been banished
to the enchanted forest


7
00:00:55.396 --> 00:00:59.600
by his jealous stepmother
Queen Kaikeyi.


8
00:01:08.276 --> 00:01:13.146
One day, Princess Sita saw
a wounded deer in the woods,


9
00:01:13.147 --> 00:01:16.350
and she begged Rama
to go and help it.


10
00:01:17.685 --> 00:01:20.887
Rama drew a circle in the ground

11
00:01:20.888 --> 00:01:22.289
and said to her,

12
00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.424
"this is a magic circle.

13
00:01:24.425 --> 00:01:26.359
"So long as you stay inside it,

14
00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:29.163
no harm can come to you."

15
00:01:32.566 --> 00:01:36.369
That night, the Princess
heard a horrible cry…


16
00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:38.771
"Aah! Help me!"

17
00:01:38.772 --> 00:01:41.574
Thinking it was
her beloved Rama in danger,


18
00:01:41.575 --> 00:01:44.177
the Princess ran from the circle

19
00:01:44.178 --> 00:01:46.180
to answer the cry.

20
00:01:54.255 --> 00:01:59.259
She soon came across
an old beggar man.


21
00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:02.128
Although she had
no money to give him,


22
00:02:02.129 --> 00:02:05.298
she could not refuse his plea.

23
00:02:05.299 --> 00:02:07.667
As soon as he had the bracelet,

24
00:02:07.668 --> 00:02:10.069
the beggar suddenly transformed

25
00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:12.672
into the 10-headed demon
Ravanna!


26
00:02:12.673 --> 00:02:15.775
He grabs the Princess
and takes her to his palace,


27
00:02:15.776 --> 00:02:19.512
where he intends
to make her his bride.


28
00:02:19.513 --> 00:02:22.114
Did you ever know
a real Prince, Maya?


29
00:02:22.115 --> 00:02:23.216
Yes…

30
00:02:23.217 --> 00:02:24.384
Laki's father.

31
00:02:24.385 --> 00:02:27.119
I thought he was in the army.

32
00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:28.154
He was,

33
00:02:28.155 --> 00:02:30.390
and he was my Prince,

34
00:02:30.391 --> 00:02:33.293
and I, his Princess.

35
00:02:33.294 --> 00:02:36.028
But I mean real princes
and princesses.


36
00:02:36.029 --> 00:02:38.298
All woman are princesses.

37
00:02:38.299 --> 00:02:40.233
It is our right.

38
00:03:21.742 --> 00:03:24.076
I shall miss it here.

39
00:03:24.077 --> 00:03:26.212
India's the only place on earth

40
00:03:26.213 --> 00:03:28.748
that stirs the imagination.

41
00:03:28.749 --> 00:03:31.685
I wish we could
stay here forever.


42
00:03:34.488 --> 00:03:36.356
I know, sweetheart,

43
00:03:36.357 --> 00:03:38.859
but now that England's
gone to war…


44
00:03:40.093 --> 00:03:41.761
I must go, too.

45
00:03:41.762 --> 00:03:43.696
You understand that, don't you?

46
00:03:43.697 --> 00:03:46.333
But why must I go to America?

47
00:03:46.334 --> 00:03:49.135
Because it's safer.
And besides,


48
00:03:49.136 --> 00:03:50.703
you'll be going
to the same school


49
00:03:50.704 --> 00:03:52.972
your mother went to
when she was your age,


50
00:03:52.973 --> 00:03:54.173
in a city called…

51
00:03:54.174 --> 00:03:55.174
New York.

52
00:03:55.175 --> 00:03:56.377
Mm-hmm.

53
00:04:00.981 --> 00:04:02.248
Papa?

54
00:04:02.249 --> 00:04:03.516
Mm-hmm?

55
00:04:03.517 --> 00:04:06.386
Maya told me that
all girls are princesses.


56
00:04:06.387 --> 00:04:08.388
Maya is a very wise woman.

57
00:04:08.389 --> 00:04:09.656
Then it's true?

58
00:04:09.657 --> 00:04:12.258
You can be anything you
want to be, my love,


59
00:04:12.259 --> 00:04:14.026
so long as you believe.

60
00:04:14.027 --> 00:04:15.662
What do you believe?

61
00:04:15.663 --> 00:04:17.430
I believe that you are

62
00:04:17.431 --> 00:04:21.702
and always will be
my little Princess.


63
00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:02.909
I gave this to your mother…

64
00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:04.911
on our wedding day.

65
00:05:04.912 --> 00:05:06.880
I want you to have it.

66
00:05:09.049 --> 00:05:12.052
She was so beautiful.

67
00:05:13.587 --> 00:05:17.323
What did you love
most about her?


68
00:05:17.324 --> 00:05:18.926
Tough question.

69
00:05:22.463 --> 00:05:26.198
I loved the way her eyes
lit up when she laughed…


70
00:05:26.199 --> 00:05:27.767
just like yours do.

71
00:05:27.768 --> 00:05:30.570
I loved the sound of her voice

72
00:05:30.571 --> 00:05:33.840
when she sang me
the Indian folk song.


73
00:05:33.841 --> 00:05:37.844
But I think…
more than anything else,


74
00:05:37.845 --> 00:05:40.648
I loved dancing with her!

75
00:05:49.356 --> 00:05:51.425
Ha ha ha!

76
00:06:54.287 --> 00:06:55.489
Hello!

77
00:06:56.289 --> 00:06:58.492
You must be Captain Crewe.

78
00:07:01.829 --> 00:07:04.130
My sister will be
down presently.


79
00:07:04.131 --> 00:07:05.565
We were just preparing

80
00:07:05.566 --> 00:07:07.166
the young lady's room.

81
00:07:07.167 --> 00:07:08.267
Your beautiful things

82
00:07:08.268 --> 00:07:09.268
arrived this morning.

83
00:07:09.269 --> 00:07:10.170
Thank you, uh…

84
00:07:10.171 --> 00:07:12.104
oh! Heavens…
Amelia.


85
00:07:12.105 --> 00:07:13.172
Amelia Minchin.

86
00:07:13.173 --> 00:07:14.440
Hee hee hee!

87
00:07:14.441 --> 00:07:17.778
Captain Crewe!

88
00:07:28.221 --> 00:07:31.158
How delightful to meet you.

89
00:07:33.393 --> 00:07:35.261
And this must be little Sara.

90
00:07:35.262 --> 00:07:37.797
My, what a beautiful child.

91
00:07:37.798 --> 00:07:39.065
I was just telling…

92
00:07:39.066 --> 00:07:41.400
thank you, Amelia.
That will be all.


93
00:07:41.401 --> 00:07:43.637
Now, won't you both follow me?

94
00:07:44.872 --> 00:07:47.807
Classes begin
promptly at 8:00.


95
00:07:47.808 --> 00:07:49.542
We cover all the subjects…

96
00:07:49.543 --> 00:07:51.410
literature, math, science,

97
00:07:51.411 --> 00:07:53.680
and, of course, both
French and Latin.


98
00:07:53.681 --> 00:07:54.947
Oh, well, Sara speaks fluent…

99
00:07:54.948 --> 00:07:56.949
luncheon is served
at 1:30,


100
00:07:56.950 --> 00:07:59.418
after which we take
our daily walk,


101
00:07:59.419 --> 00:08:00.519
unless, of course,

102
00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:02.021
the weather is
extremely inclement.


103
00:08:02.022 --> 00:08:02.956
From 4:00,

104
00:08:02.957 --> 00:08:05.692
the girls attend
classes in etiquette


105
00:08:05.693 --> 00:08:07.560
where they are
personally trained


106
00:08:07.561 --> 00:08:09.962
in all the formal
graces of society.


107
00:08:09.963 --> 00:08:10.764
Study hall

108
00:08:10.765 --> 00:08:13.265
is between

109
00:08:13.266 --> 00:08:14.934
followed by a light supper.

110
00:08:14.935 --> 00:08:16.402
And then, before bedtime,

111
00:08:16.403 --> 00:08:18.404
we read from
one of the classics,


112
00:08:18.405 --> 00:08:19.405
something the children

113
00:08:19.406 --> 00:08:20.539
always look forward to

114
00:08:20.540 --> 00:08:22.241
with great anticipation.

115
00:08:22.242 --> 00:08:23.442
Sunday is a day of rest.

116
00:08:23.443 --> 00:08:25.477
Students are allowed to
write only to their parents,


117
00:08:25.478 --> 00:08:27.379
and, of course,
we attend church.


118
00:08:27.380 --> 00:08:29.182
Have you any questions?

119
00:08:41.361 --> 00:08:42.930
Come along, dear.

120
00:08:50.203 --> 00:08:51.304
Ahem! Ahem!

121
00:08:52.339 --> 00:08:53.606
Oh, eh…

122
00:08:53.607 --> 00:08:54.741
Je mange…

123
00:08:54.742 --> 00:08:56.142
Tu mange…

124
00:08:56.143 --> 00:08:58.144
Excusez-moi,
monsieur DuFarge.


125
00:08:58.145 --> 00:09:01.213
Girls, I would like
you to say hello


126
00:09:01.214 --> 00:09:02.682
to our new arrival.

127
00:09:02.683 --> 00:09:04.316
Miss Sara Crewe.

128
00:09:04.317 --> 00:09:06.418
Hello, Sara.

129
00:09:06.419 --> 00:09:07.586
You must tell them

130
00:09:07.587 --> 00:09:09.756
all about your
exciting life in India.


131
00:09:09.757 --> 00:09:10.890
No doubt she'll be

132
00:09:10.891 --> 00:09:14.093
our most popular
student in no time.


133
00:09:14.094 --> 00:09:16.462
Now, there are certain rules

134
00:09:16.463 --> 00:09:18.497
that should be made quite clear.

135
00:09:18.498 --> 00:09:20.032
The first is the order rule,

136
00:09:20.033 --> 00:09:21.634
which requires the girls

137
00:09:21.635 --> 00:09:23.903
to keep their rooms
spotless at all times.


138
00:09:23.904 --> 00:09:25.905
Next is the kindness rule

139
00:09:25.906 --> 00:09:29.209
which teaches the girls…

140
00:09:51.098 --> 00:09:53.199
these rules are
strictly enforced,


141
00:09:53.200 --> 00:09:55.668
but I can assure
you, Captain Crewe,


142
00:09:55.669 --> 00:09:58.004
the results are well
worth the effort.


143
00:09:58.005 --> 00:10:00.072
Our reputation for sending

144
00:10:00.073 --> 00:10:03.810
the most poised and charming
young ladies into society


145
00:10:03.811 --> 00:10:06.813
is one of the highest.

146
00:10:06.814 --> 00:10:08.281
I've no doubt.

147
00:10:09.216 --> 00:10:13.686
Also, I'm afraid
jewelry and such finery


148
00:10:13.687 --> 00:10:14.687
are not allowed.

149
00:10:14.688 --> 00:10:16.288
What if I wear it in my room

150
00:10:16.289 --> 00:10:18.025
during my free time?

151
00:10:19.126 --> 00:10:22.029
Well, if you absolutely insist.

152
00:10:24.231 --> 00:10:25.698
I do.

153
00:10:27.567 --> 00:10:29.302
She's gonna get
in so much trouble.


154
00:10:34.541 --> 00:10:35.708
Monsieur?

155
00:10:35.709 --> 00:10:37.409
Je mange.

156
00:10:37.410 --> 00:10:38.677
Je mange.

157
00:10:38.678 --> 00:10:39.812
Tu mange.

158
00:10:39.813 --> 00:10:41.148
Tu mange.

159
00:10:45.318 --> 00:10:47.419
This is splendid.

160
00:10:47.420 --> 00:10:50.222
It's our largest suite.

161
00:10:50.223 --> 00:10:51.791
Thank you for all
the care you've taken,


162
00:10:51.792 --> 00:10:54.060
miss Minchin.
I want Sara to feel


163
00:10:54.061 --> 00:10:57.029
as much at home as
possible while I'm away.


164
00:10:57.030 --> 00:10:58.731
No expense should be spared.

165
00:10:58.732 --> 00:10:59.966
Of course not.

166
00:10:59.967 --> 00:11:02.568
Now, I'll let you two
say your good-byes.


167
00:11:02.569 --> 00:11:03.736
I know you don't have much time

168
00:11:03.737 --> 00:11:05.472
before your boat leaves.

169
00:11:20.153 --> 00:11:23.456
We'll write to
each other every day.


170
00:11:30.730 --> 00:11:32.731
How do you like your room?

171
00:11:32.732 --> 00:11:35.001
I made sure it was the best…

172
00:11:35.002 --> 00:11:38.470
corner windows and a fireplace.

173
00:11:38.471 --> 00:11:39.638
And with all your toys

174
00:11:39.639 --> 00:11:42.141
and clothes moved in, it's…

175
00:11:42.142 --> 00:11:44.812
it's just as if you were really…

176
00:11:47.614 --> 00:11:50.016
you know, I think
I saw something…


177
00:11:50.017 --> 00:11:52.219
on that chair over there.

178
00:11:56.023 --> 00:11:57.924
She came all the way from France

179
00:11:57.925 --> 00:11:59.993
just to be with you.

180
00:12:02.395 --> 00:12:05.065
Her name is Emily.

181
00:12:06.399 --> 00:12:07.835
Emily!

182
00:12:10.203 --> 00:12:14.006
You know, dolls make
the very best friends.


183
00:12:14.007 --> 00:12:16.242
Just because they can't speak

184
00:12:16.243 --> 00:12:18.878
doesn't mean they don't listen.

185
00:12:18.879 --> 00:12:20.246
And did you know

186
00:12:20.247 --> 00:12:22.681
that when we leave them
alone in our room,


187
00:12:22.682 --> 00:12:23.650
they come to life?

188
00:12:23.651 --> 00:12:25.084
They do?
Yes!


189
00:12:25.085 --> 00:12:27.053
But before we walk
in and catch them,


190
00:12:27.054 --> 00:12:28.387
they return to their places

191
00:12:28.388 --> 00:12:29.889
quick as lightning.

192
00:12:29.890 --> 00:12:31.924
Why don't they come
to life in front of us


193
00:12:31.925 --> 00:12:33.092
so we can see them?

194
00:12:33.093 --> 00:12:35.262
Because it's magic.

195
00:12:36.529 --> 00:12:38.297
Magic has to be believed.

196
00:12:38.298 --> 00:12:41.368
That's the only way it's real.

197
00:12:43.803 --> 00:12:45.771
Whenever you're afraid

198
00:12:45.772 --> 00:12:47.506
or miss me terribly,

199
00:12:47.507 --> 00:12:50.642
just tell Emily…

200
00:12:50.643 --> 00:12:52.278
and she'll get a message to me

201
00:12:52.279 --> 00:12:54.914
wherever I am,

202
00:12:54.915 --> 00:12:57.917
and then I'll send
one back right aways


203
00:12:57.918 --> 00:13:01.187
so that when you hug her,

204
00:13:01.188 --> 00:13:02.554
you'll really be getting

205
00:13:02.555 --> 00:13:04.424
a hug from me.

206
00:13:12.532 --> 00:13:15.135
It's all right, papa.

207
00:13:16.669 --> 00:13:19.506
I'm going to be fine.

208
00:13:27.547 --> 00:13:30.816
What are you doing?

209
00:13:30.817 --> 00:13:33.285
Memorizing me by heart?

210
00:13:33.286 --> 00:13:35.854
No.

211
00:13:35.855 --> 00:13:39.426
I already know you by heart.

212
00:13:59.146 --> 00:14:01.414
Good-bye, Princess.

213
00:14:32.279 --> 00:14:34.247
What were all those
noises last night?


214
00:14:36.916 --> 00:14:38.050
That's nothing.

215
00:14:38.051 --> 00:14:39.918
You should hear Josephine snore.

216
00:14:41.388 --> 00:14:42.222
I do not!

217
00:14:42.223 --> 00:14:45.191
Then who was it?
The new girl?


218
00:14:45.192 --> 00:14:47.926
She hasn't come
out of her room yet.


219
00:14:47.927 --> 00:14:49.928
Did you see all of her toys?

220
00:14:49.929 --> 00:14:51.463
I want your hair ribbon.

221
00:14:51.464 --> 00:14:53.665
Her father grows
crackers or something.


222
00:14:53.666 --> 00:14:55.667
They're very rich.

223
00:14:55.668 --> 00:14:56.702
They must be.

224
00:14:56.703 --> 00:14:58.537
Everyone I know eats crackers.

225
00:14:58.538 --> 00:14:59.705
Her father's British.

226
00:14:59.706 --> 00:15:02.208
I heard he's best friends
with the king and Queen.


227
00:15:02.209 --> 00:15:05.644
Hah! Well, I heard he
was thrown out of India


228
00:15:05.645 --> 00:15:06.546
because people died

229
00:15:06.547 --> 00:15:08.547
from eating his
poisoned crackers.


230
00:15:08.548 --> 00:15:10.082
Poisoned crackers.

231
00:15:10.083 --> 00:15:11.817
Poisoned crackers?

232
00:15:11.818 --> 00:15:13.219
I once had an aunt

233
00:15:13.220 --> 00:15:15.687
who died from eating
poisoned string beans.


234
00:15:15.688 --> 00:15:17.423
Oh, who cares about her?

235
00:15:17.424 --> 00:15:19.392
Yeah, who cares?

236
00:15:21.761 --> 00:15:24.630
But before we walk in
and catch them,


237
00:15:24.631 --> 00:15:27.534
they return to their places
quick as lightning.


238
00:15:28.568 --> 00:15:30.136
Gosh, she's fast.

239
00:15:42.515 --> 00:15:44.051
Mama.

240
00:15:45.852 --> 00:15:47.053
Sara.

241
00:15:47.054 --> 00:15:48.120
We're not accustomed

242
00:15:48.121 --> 00:15:49.056
to delaying everyone's breakfast

243
00:15:49.057 --> 00:15:50.222
for one student.

244
00:15:50.223 --> 00:15:51.390
I'm sorry, miss Minchin, but…

245
00:15:51.391 --> 00:15:53.225
you're not the only
child here, Sara.


246
00:15:53.226 --> 00:15:54.993
You must remember that.

247
00:15:54.994 --> 00:15:57.296
Ah, bonjour, monsieur dufarge.

248
00:15:57.297 --> 00:15:59.731
Comment d'etes vous aujourd'hui?

249
00:15:59.732 --> 00:16:01.867
Oh, yes, yes, yes.

250
00:16:01.868 --> 00:16:03.001
Good morning.

251
00:16:03.002 --> 00:16:04.603
I trust you remember
our newest pupil


252
00:16:04.604 --> 00:16:06.438
from our visit to
your class yesterday.


253
00:16:06.439 --> 00:16:08.640
Sara, this is monsieur dufarge.

254
00:16:08.641 --> 00:16:11.143
You begin French lessons
with him this afternoon.


255
00:16:11.144 --> 00:16:13.179
Do I have to?

256
00:16:13.180 --> 00:16:15.414
Sara! You most
certainly do.


257
00:16:15.415 --> 00:16:17.249
Now, apologize
to monsieur this instant


258
00:16:17.250 --> 00:16:18.550
for your rudeness.

259
00:16:18.551 --> 00:16:20.352
But I didn't mean to be rude.

260
00:16:20.353 --> 00:16:21.621
Now!

261
00:16:25.425 --> 00:16:28.026
Monsieur, je regrette,

262
00:16:28.027 --> 00:16:31.430
mais je sais parler francais.

263
00:16:31.431 --> 00:16:33.232
J'ai etudiá en inde
avec mon pére,


264
00:16:33.233 --> 00:16:34.400
qui habitait a Paris

265
00:16:34.401 --> 00:16:38.036
quand il átait un petit garçon.

266
00:16:38.037 --> 00:16:39.171
This child doesn't need

267
00:16:39.172 --> 00:16:40.439
to learn French.

268
00:16:40.440 --> 00:16:43.041
She practically is French.

269
00:16:43.042 --> 00:16:44.543
Says she learned it
from her father.


270
00:16:44.544 --> 00:16:47.913
I understood perfectly well
what she said, monsieur.


271
00:16:47.914 --> 00:16:49.315
I'm sorry, but we
tried to tell you.


272
00:16:49.316 --> 00:16:50.416
Well, perhaps she can

273
00:16:50.417 --> 00:16:51.950
tutor the younger children,

274
00:16:51.951 --> 00:16:53.719
and she might just
be able to help you


275
00:16:53.720 --> 00:16:57.323
with your pronunciation,
miss Minchin.


276
00:16:57.324 --> 00:17:00.392
Are those sausages I smell?

277
00:17:00.393 --> 00:17:01.394
Ohh!

278
00:17:14.674 --> 00:17:15.907
Thank you.

279
00:17:15.908 --> 00:17:16.975
Sara…

280
00:17:16.976 --> 00:17:19.378
there's no talking at the table.

281
00:17:19.379 --> 00:17:21.713
It doesn't seem natural.

282
00:17:24.317 --> 00:17:27.086
I won't say it again.

283
00:17:35.162 --> 00:17:37.963
7 times 5 is 35.

284
00:17:37.964 --> 00:17:40.699
7 times 6 is 42.

285
00:17:40.700 --> 00:17:42.568
7 times 7 is 49.

286
00:17:42.569 --> 00:17:45.437
7 times 8 is…

287
00:17:45.438 --> 00:17:47.839
58.

288
00:17:47.840 --> 00:17:48.840
No, wait.

289
00:17:48.841 --> 00:17:51.577
54?

290
00:17:51.578 --> 00:17:52.811
No, um…

291
00:17:52.812 --> 00:17:54.079
55?

292
00:17:54.080 --> 00:17:57.082
Or 72? Or 93?
Or 12?


293
00:17:57.083 --> 00:17:59.651
I'm sorry, miss Minchin.

294
00:17:59.652 --> 00:18:02.588
I studied for hours last night.

295
00:18:02.589 --> 00:18:04.656
I find that very hard
to believe,


296
00:18:04.657 --> 00:18:07.459
and I imagine your
father will, as well.


297
00:18:07.460 --> 00:18:09.995
Please don't tell
him, miss Minchin.


298
00:18:09.996 --> 00:18:12.231
I promise I'll do better.

299
00:18:12.232 --> 00:18:13.999
Please?

300
00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:16.135
Lavinia, you may continue.

301
00:18:17.003 --> 00:18:20.005
7 times 8 is 56.

302
00:18:20.006 --> 00:18:24.142
7 times 9 is…63.

303
00:18:24.143 --> 00:18:28.280
7 times 5 is 35.

304
00:18:28.281 --> 00:18:30.882
7 times 6 is 42.

305
00:18:30.883 --> 00:18:33.084
7 times 7 is 49.

306
00:18:33.085 --> 00:18:36.955
Dear papa, I miss you already.

307
00:18:36.956 --> 00:18:40.692
Things are fine,
except I never imagined


308
00:18:40.693 --> 00:18:43.429
there would be
so many rules at school.


309
00:18:43.430 --> 00:18:45.831
I guess they're there
for a purpose,


310
00:18:45.832 --> 00:18:48.567
and I'm trying hard
to obey them,


311
00:18:48.568 --> 00:18:52.205
but I get the feeling
I'm doing something wrong.


312
00:19:09.155 --> 00:19:10.789
Good-bye, father.

313
00:19:10.790 --> 00:19:12.924
John…

314
00:19:12.925 --> 00:19:14.261
my son.

315
00:19:28.575 --> 00:19:31.009
I hope when you read this,

316
00:19:31.010 --> 00:19:32.611
it kindles your heart

317
00:19:32.612 --> 00:19:35.213
and puts a smile on your face.

318
00:19:35.214 --> 00:19:37.215
Papa, I'm so proud of you,

319
00:19:37.216 --> 00:19:39.618
and I think about you
every moment,


320
00:19:39.619 --> 00:19:42.821
and I love you forever…

321
00:19:42.822 --> 00:19:44.557
your Sara.

322
00:19:54.767 --> 00:19:56.768
Aaah! Aaaah! Aah!

323
00:19:56.769 --> 00:19:59.505
Now, now, lottie, you
mustn't get so excited.


324
00:19:59.506 --> 00:20:01.507
Lottie, precious, dear…

325
00:20:01.508 --> 00:20:03.842
oh, please, lottie dear!

326
00:20:03.843 --> 00:20:05.977
Please stop screaming!

327
00:20:05.978 --> 00:20:07.513
Um, how about a cookie?

328
00:20:07.514 --> 00:20:08.980
Would you like that?

329
00:20:08.981 --> 00:20:10.382
Aah! Aaaah!

330
00:20:10.383 --> 00:20:12.451
I'll get a cookie.

331
00:20:12.452 --> 00:20:15.387
Aaaaah! Aaaaah!

332
00:20:15.388 --> 00:20:18.023
Aaaaaaaaaaah!

333
00:20:18.024 --> 00:20:20.526
Aaahhh! Aaahhh!

334
00:20:20.527 --> 00:20:21.693
You know, it's
very hard to study


335
00:20:21.694 --> 00:20:23.862
with you carrying on like this.

336
00:20:23.863 --> 00:20:25.130
I want my mama!

337
00:20:25.131 --> 00:20:26.598
You'll see her soon.

338
00:20:26.599 --> 00:20:28.534
No, I won't!
She's dead!


339
00:20:28.535 --> 00:20:30.802
And I won't ever see her again!

340
00:20:30.803 --> 00:20:34.341
Well, I don't have
a mother, either.


341
00:20:37.276 --> 00:20:39.011
You don't?

342
00:20:41.013 --> 00:20:42.314
Where is she?

343
00:20:42.315 --> 00:20:45.417
In heaven, with my baby sister,

344
00:20:45.418 --> 00:20:48.320
but that doesn't mean
I can't talk to her.


345
00:20:48.321 --> 00:20:52.290
I tell her everything,
and I know she hears me.


346
00:20:52.291 --> 00:20:54.426
How?

347
00:20:54.427 --> 00:20:56.695
Because that's what angels do.

348
00:20:56.696 --> 00:20:58.897
Your mama's an angel?

349
00:20:58.898 --> 00:21:00.031
Of course,

350
00:21:00.032 --> 00:21:01.433
and so is yours,

351
00:21:01.434 --> 00:21:04.202
with beautiful wings of silk

352
00:21:04.203 --> 00:21:06.438
and a crown of baby rosebuds.

353
00:21:06.439 --> 00:21:09.307
And they all live
together in a castle.


354
00:21:09.308 --> 00:21:12.177
And do you know
what it's made of?


355
00:21:12.178 --> 00:21:13.379
Sunflowers…

356
00:21:13.380 --> 00:21:14.846
hundreds of them…

357
00:21:14.847 --> 00:21:17.182
so bright they shine like gold.

358
00:21:18.385 --> 00:21:21.487
And when the angels want
to go someplace,


359
00:21:21.488 --> 00:21:23.188
they just whistle like this.

360
00:21:31.531 --> 00:21:33.365
And a cloud floats
to the castle door


361
00:21:33.366 --> 00:21:35.467
and picks them up,

362
00:21:35.468 --> 00:21:37.769
and as the angels
fly through the sky,


363
00:21:37.770 --> 00:21:41.407
riding the cloud
like a magic carpet,


364
00:21:41.408 --> 00:21:45.077
under the moon and
through the stars…


365
00:21:48.615 --> 00:21:52.885
until they're hovering
right above us.


366
00:21:54.721 --> 00:21:55.787
That's how they can look down

367
00:21:55.788 --> 00:21:59.625
and see if we're all right.

368
00:21:59.626 --> 00:22:03.062
And sometimes they even
send messages to us.


369
00:22:04.631 --> 00:22:08.166
Of course, you can't
hear the messages


370
00:22:08.167 --> 00:22:09.601
if you're kicking and screaming

371
00:22:09.602 --> 00:22:11.103
as loudly as you were…

372
00:22:12.371 --> 00:22:14.873
but they always try again,

373
00:22:14.874 --> 00:22:16.842
just in case we've missed it.

374
00:22:20.012 --> 00:22:22.113
Hey, wait.

375
00:22:22.114 --> 00:22:23.549
That's Becky.

376
00:22:23.550 --> 00:22:25.717
She's not allowed to talk to us.

377
00:22:25.718 --> 00:22:26.718
Why not?

378
00:22:26.719 --> 00:22:28.454
She's a servant girl,

379
00:22:28.455 --> 00:22:30.922
and she has dark skin.

380
00:22:30.923 --> 00:22:31.990
So?

381
00:22:31.991 --> 00:22:35.928
Well, doesn't that
mean something?


382
00:23:20.106 --> 00:23:21.139
I'm sorry. I…

383
00:23:21.140 --> 00:23:24.042
is there anything
I can do for you, miss?


384
00:23:24.043 --> 00:23:26.778
I just came up here
to change my shoes.


385
00:23:26.779 --> 00:23:29.380
No. No,
there's nothing.


386
00:23:29.381 --> 00:23:31.650
Well, then, begging your pardon,

387
00:23:31.651 --> 00:23:34.986
but we'll both be
in trouble if you stay.


388
00:23:39.659 --> 00:23:42.862
All right, girls.
Pair up.


389
00:23:44.864 --> 00:23:46.599
Pair up.

390
00:24:37.216 --> 00:24:40.952
"Sir Edward saw the sorrow
in his daughter's eyes,"


391
00:24:40.953 --> 00:24:43.555
"but he knew that
family honor must prevail"


392
00:24:43.556 --> 00:24:44.890
"at all costs."

393
00:24:44.891 --> 00:24:47.693
"Nobility was not a thing
to be trifled with."


394
00:24:47.694 --> 00:24:50.629
"I beg of you, Charlotte,
he said,"


395
00:24:50.630 --> 00:24:52.463
marry Sir John in the spring

396
00:24:52.464 --> 00:24:54.232
"as he has asked."

397
00:24:54.233 --> 00:24:55.901
Thank you, lavinia.

398
00:24:55.902 --> 00:24:58.705
Sara, you may take your turn.

399
00:25:09.081 --> 00:25:10.816
"Charlotte turned to her father

400
00:25:10.817 --> 00:25:13.018
"and said,
father, you are right.


401
00:25:13.019 --> 00:25:15.553
"I must put away
my foolish fancies


402
00:25:15.554 --> 00:25:17.023
and childhood wishes."

403
00:25:26.733 --> 00:25:29.200
"But I simply won't do it.

404
00:25:29.201 --> 00:25:30.769
"I'm sorry, father,

405
00:25:30.770 --> 00:25:32.804
but when I marry,
it will be for love."


406
00:25:32.805 --> 00:25:36.541
And with that, Charlotte
ran from the house.


407
00:25:36.542 --> 00:25:37.843
Waiting outside for her

408
00:25:37.844 --> 00:25:39.611
was the handsome stable boy
Pierre,


409
00:25:39.612 --> 00:25:41.613
whom Charlotte secretly adored.

410
00:25:41.614 --> 00:25:43.615
Together
they escaped to the coast


411
00:25:43.616 --> 00:25:46.618
and quickly set sail
for the island of Tahiti.


412
00:25:46.619 --> 00:25:48.286
But when they were
halfway there,


413
00:25:48.287 --> 00:25:51.790
their ship was attacked
by a band of pirates.


414
00:25:51.791 --> 00:25:53.625
Rather than be eaten alive,

415
00:25:53.626 --> 00:25:54.760
Charlotte and Pierre

416
00:25:54.761 --> 00:25:57.495
threw themselves
into the raging sea.


417
00:25:57.496 --> 00:25:59.364
And as they began to drown,

418
00:25:59.365 --> 00:26:01.132
they held each other close

419
00:26:01.133 --> 00:26:02.768
and swore their undying love.

420
00:26:05.138 --> 00:26:07.272
But then, when all seemed lost,

421
00:26:07.273 --> 00:26:09.675
a group of mermaids
appeared and rescued…


422
00:26:09.676 --> 00:26:10.877
stop!

423
00:26:15.547 --> 00:26:17.348
What are you doing?

424
00:26:17.349 --> 00:26:20.952
I couldn't bear to see
Charlotte marry that awful man,


425
00:26:20.953 --> 00:26:22.721
so I imagined
a different ending.


426
00:26:22.722 --> 00:26:24.156
You imagined it.

427
00:26:24.991 --> 00:26:27.693
Don't you ever do that,
miss Minchin?


428
00:26:27.694 --> 00:26:31.297
Believe in something
just to make it seem real?


429
00:26:33.565 --> 00:26:34.966
I suppose that's rather easy

430
00:26:34.967 --> 00:26:37.168
for a child who has everything.

431
00:26:37.169 --> 00:26:38.336
But from now on,

432
00:26:38.337 --> 00:26:40.972
there will be no more
make-believe at this school


433
00:26:40.973 --> 00:26:43.474
during reading hour
or at any other time!


434
00:26:43.475 --> 00:26:44.876
Is that understood?

435
00:26:44.877 --> 00:26:46.812
Yes, miss Minchin.

436
00:26:46.813 --> 00:26:49.181
Now, all of you, go to
your bed this instant.


437
00:26:53.485 --> 00:26:55.754
I never heard a story like that

438
00:26:55.755 --> 00:26:57.155
in my whole life.

439
00:26:57.156 --> 00:26:59.624
I bet you know lots of them,

440
00:26:59.625 --> 00:27:01.026
don't you, Sara?

441
00:27:01.027 --> 00:27:03.963
I want silence up there!

442
00:27:04.897 --> 00:27:06.564
We have to do something

443
00:27:06.565 --> 00:27:09.067
about this communication rule.

444
00:27:09.068 --> 00:27:11.803
Hey, after Minchin goes to bed,

445
00:27:11.804 --> 00:27:13.204
we'll sneak into your room,

446
00:27:13.205 --> 00:27:16.674
and you can show us
what a real story is.


447
00:27:16.675 --> 00:27:17.943
How about it, Sara?

448
00:27:17.944 --> 00:27:20.411
Well, only if it's
just you three.


449
00:27:20.412 --> 00:27:22.547
Colleen, wait for me.

450
00:27:22.548 --> 00:27:23.750
Shh!

451
00:27:43.602 --> 00:27:45.371
Come on, come on.

452
00:28:08.861 --> 00:28:10.295
The evil Ravanna

453
00:28:10.296 --> 00:28:13.164
locked the Princess up
in his palace tower.


454
00:28:13.165 --> 00:28:15.901
There she stayed for many weeks,

455
00:28:15.902 --> 00:28:18.036
just staring out her window,

456
00:28:18.037 --> 00:28:21.107
missing her Prince Rama
terribly.


457
00:28:28.680 --> 00:28:30.348
Bonjour, papa.

458
00:28:30.349 --> 00:28:33.551
Je suis trés contente
de vous voir.


459
00:28:33.552 --> 00:28:34.820
Bonjour, papa.

460
00:28:34.821 --> 00:28:38.290
Je suis trés contente
de vous voir.


461
00:28:39.792 --> 00:28:41.692
Perfect.

462
00:28:41.693 --> 00:28:44.030
You look just like Emily.

463
00:28:45.564 --> 00:28:47.698
My father hates dolls,

464
00:28:47.699 --> 00:28:49.835
and he hates coming here.

465
00:28:49.836 --> 00:28:52.237
Says he doesn't belong.

466
00:28:52.238 --> 00:28:54.840
Then why does he send you?

467
00:28:54.841 --> 00:28:57.742
'Cause he wants me to belong.

468
00:29:27.273 --> 00:29:31.476
My little girl,
she spoke French!


469
00:29:31.477 --> 00:29:34.046
She really spoke French.

470
00:29:35.747 --> 00:29:38.050
Your mother and I
are very proud of you.


471
00:29:41.387 --> 00:29:42.487
Hello, sweetheart.

472
00:29:42.488 --> 00:29:43.688
Hi.

473
00:29:43.689 --> 00:29:45.823
Hi.

474
00:29:45.824 --> 00:29:49.395
I caught you, Debbie.

475
00:29:51.030 --> 00:29:54.100
Oh, you look so pretty…

476
00:30:13.819 --> 00:30:15.187
papa!

477
00:30:50.789 --> 00:30:53.525
Oh.

478
00:31:05.271 --> 00:31:06.471
Randolph?

479
00:31:06.472 --> 00:31:07.473
John!

480
00:31:10.909 --> 00:31:14.145
Rama approached
the thorny palace…


481
00:31:14.146 --> 00:31:17.248
unaware that Ravanna
was waiting for him.


482
00:31:17.249 --> 00:31:18.883
Oh!

483
00:31:18.884 --> 00:31:20.086
Why?

484
00:31:27.759 --> 00:31:29.794
That's it!

485
00:31:29.795 --> 00:31:31.129
I can't take it anymore.

486
00:31:31.130 --> 00:31:33.564
I don't care what you say
about Sara's stories.


487
00:31:33.565 --> 00:31:34.565
They've got to be more fun

488
00:31:34.566 --> 00:31:36.502
than watching
your hair being combed.


489
00:31:38.104 --> 00:31:40.305
If anyone else
feels the same way,


490
00:31:40.306 --> 00:31:42.408
I think she should leave, too.

491
00:31:51.217 --> 00:31:52.984
Come on, come on.

492
00:31:52.985 --> 00:31:54.553
Shh.

493
00:31:57.056 --> 00:31:59.957
But the evil Ravanna
was not through yet.


494
00:31:59.958 --> 00:32:02.093
This time he took a bow

495
00:32:02.094 --> 00:32:05.063
that could hold not 1,
but 10 arrows,


496
00:32:05.064 --> 00:32:07.298
each filled
with a deadly poison.


497
00:32:07.299 --> 00:32:09.834
The arrows sped through the air,

498
00:32:09.835 --> 00:32:11.902
heading straight for Rama.

499
00:32:11.903 --> 00:32:14.372
And the arrows hit the ground

500
00:32:14.373 --> 00:32:16.107
and released their poison,

501
00:32:16.108 --> 00:32:20.712
giant clouds of thick,
yellow smoke.


502
00:32:57.049 --> 00:32:58.049
Unh.

503
00:33:26.145 --> 00:33:28.045
I want a big piece!

504
00:33:28.046 --> 00:33:29.447
Oh, hush up, lottie.

505
00:33:29.448 --> 00:33:31.048
I'm sure Princess Sara

506
00:33:31.049 --> 00:33:33.151
will give everyone
her fair share.


507
00:33:33.152 --> 00:33:35.153
Right, Princess?

508
00:33:35.154 --> 00:33:37.922
I told her that's what you were.

509
00:33:37.923 --> 00:33:39.324
Well, not just me.

510
00:33:39.325 --> 00:33:40.858
All girls are princesses,

511
00:33:40.859 --> 00:33:45.163
even snotty, two-faced
bullies like you, lavinia.


512
00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:50.668
Who wants cake?

513
00:33:50.669 --> 00:33:52.937
I do. I do.
I do.


514
00:33:52.938 --> 00:33:54.805
I get the top!

515
00:33:54.806 --> 00:33:56.207
I get that one.

516
00:33:56.208 --> 00:33:58.075
Can I get the top?

517
00:33:58.076 --> 00:34:00.779
Here, lavinia,
you get a big piece.


518
00:34:13.892 --> 00:34:15.092
Miss Minchin?

519
00:34:15.093 --> 00:34:17.094
Yes. May I help you?

520
00:34:17.095 --> 00:34:19.797
I'm Mr. barrow…

521
00:34:19.798 --> 00:34:21.699
Captain Crewe's solicitor.

522
00:34:21.700 --> 00:34:23.668
Oh. Oh, yes.

523
00:34:23.669 --> 00:34:25.137
Do come in.

524
00:34:28.207 --> 00:34:30.641
We're just celebrating
little Sara's birthday.


525
00:34:30.642 --> 00:34:32.710
May I speak to you in private?

526
00:34:32.711 --> 00:34:34.712
Oh, yes.
Of course.


527
00:34:34.713 --> 00:34:36.315
Right this way.

528
00:35:09.215 --> 00:35:11.549
May I just say,
Mr. barrow,


529
00:35:11.550 --> 00:35:14.252
that Sara is quite
the favorite around here.


530
00:35:14.253 --> 00:35:15.686
We went to great lengths

531
00:35:15.687 --> 00:35:18.890
to make this
a special day for her.


532
00:35:31.237 --> 00:35:33.871
I'm afraid your check
to us this month


533
00:35:33.872 --> 00:35:35.773
will be rather large.

534
00:35:35.774 --> 00:35:39.644
There will be no check,
miss Minchin.


535
00:35:39.645 --> 00:35:41.347
Excuse me?

536
00:35:58.630 --> 00:35:59.764
Nya nya nya…

537
00:35:59.765 --> 00:36:00.766
oh!

538
00:36:04.536 --> 00:36:05.537
Ha!

539
00:36:08.173 --> 00:36:09.340
Aah!

540
00:36:09.341 --> 00:36:11.277
Ow!
Ooh.


541
00:36:32.731 --> 00:36:34.999
The party is over!

542
00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:36.100
I want everyone

543
00:36:36.101 --> 00:36:36.968
to go to their rooms
this instant.


544
00:36:36.969 --> 00:36:38.135
But, miss Minchin…

545
00:36:38.136 --> 00:36:40.638
Sara, you will stay behind.

546
00:36:40.639 --> 00:36:43.774
I have something to tell you.

547
00:36:43.775 --> 00:36:44.776
Move!

548
00:36:52.384 --> 00:36:54.385
Amelia, go to Sara's room

549
00:36:54.386 --> 00:36:56.253
and find a simple black dress.

550
00:36:56.254 --> 00:36:57.388
If she has nothing suitable,

551
00:36:57.389 --> 00:36:58.723
borrow one from the other girls.

552
00:36:58.724 --> 00:36:59.724
But, sister…

553
00:36:59.725 --> 00:37:01.327
do as I say.

554
00:37:10.669 --> 00:37:14.606
Why would I need
a black dress, miss Minchin?


555
00:37:29.688 --> 00:37:32.891
I'm afraid I have
some bad news, Sara.


556
00:37:35.026 --> 00:37:36.895
Your father has…

557
00:37:39.030 --> 00:37:40.999
your father.

558
00:37:42.434 --> 00:37:46.571
It's been discovered
that your father has died.


559
00:37:46.572 --> 00:37:50.041
He was killed in battle
several weeks ago.


560
00:37:52.043 --> 00:37:53.277
I'm sorry,

561
00:37:53.278 --> 00:37:56.080
but that's the reality
of the situation,


562
00:37:56.081 --> 00:37:59.850
and there's nothing anyone
can do to change it.


563
00:37:59.851 --> 00:38:03.320
What's more,
the British government


564
00:38:03.321 --> 00:38:04.522
has seized control
of his company


565
00:38:04.523 --> 00:38:05.756
and all of his assets,

566
00:38:05.757 --> 00:38:09.026
leaving you penniless,
without any money.


567
00:38:09.027 --> 00:38:10.327
And since you have

568
00:38:10.328 --> 00:38:11.496
no relations to speak of,

569
00:38:11.497 --> 00:38:14.366
this puts me in
a terrible position.


570
00:38:16.334 --> 00:38:18.335
What are you staring at?

571
00:38:18.336 --> 00:38:21.772
Don't you understand
what I'm saying?


572
00:38:21.773 --> 00:38:24.008
You are alone in the world…

573
00:38:26.845 --> 00:38:29.514
Unless I decide to keep you here

574
00:38:29.515 --> 00:38:31.550
out of charity.

575
00:38:42.628 --> 00:38:44.795
Because of the expenses
you've incurred,


576
00:38:44.796 --> 00:38:47.398
everything you own
now belongs to me…


577
00:38:47.399 --> 00:38:49.934
your clothes,
your toys, everything,


578
00:38:49.935 --> 00:38:51.736
though it will hardly
make up for


579
00:38:51.737 --> 00:38:55.005
the financial losses
I have suffered.


580
00:38:55.006 --> 00:38:55.974
From now on,

581
00:38:55.975 --> 00:38:58.075
you must earn your
room and board here.


582
00:38:58.076 --> 00:39:00.277
You will move to
the attic with Becky


583
00:39:00.278 --> 00:39:02.047
and work as a servant.

584
00:39:03.415 --> 00:39:04.615
If you fail to meet

585
00:39:04.616 --> 00:39:05.816
the standards
of this institution,


586
00:39:05.817 --> 00:39:07.952
or if you don't do
as you're told,


587
00:39:07.953 --> 00:39:09.119
you'll be thrown out.

588
00:39:09.120 --> 00:39:11.689
And believe me, Sara,
the streets of this city


589
00:39:11.690 --> 00:39:14.626
are not kind
to homeless beggars.


590
00:39:19.465 --> 00:39:21.298
You should report
to Mabel in the kitchen


591
00:39:21.299 --> 00:39:23.535
promptly at 5 A.M.

592
00:39:26.438 --> 00:39:29.040
I could have you arrested
for taking this.


593
00:39:31.009 --> 00:39:33.744
You're lucky I let you
keep that doll.


594
00:39:33.745 --> 00:39:35.613
You may have the book,

595
00:39:35.614 --> 00:39:37.748
but another incident like this,

596
00:39:37.749 --> 00:39:40.552
and I will call the authorities.

597
00:39:42.353 --> 00:39:44.955
I expect you to
remember, Sara Crewe,


598
00:39:44.956 --> 00:39:47.659
you're not a Princess
any longer.


599
00:41:00.498 --> 00:41:02.568
Papa?

600
00:41:05.971 --> 00:41:07.172
Papa?

601
00:41:09.340 --> 00:41:11.176
Papa…

602
00:41:12.578 --> 00:41:14.045
Papa…

603
00:41:16.181 --> 00:41:18.183
Papa, please…

604
00:41:21.319 --> 00:41:23.188
Papa!

605
00:41:24.322 --> 00:41:26.056
Papa…

606
00:41:32.097 --> 00:41:34.065
Papa!

607
00:42:02.360 --> 00:42:03.360
Sara…

608
00:42:03.361 --> 00:42:04.428
What happened?

609
00:42:04.429 --> 00:42:06.864
Sara, you are to serve the girls

610
00:42:06.865 --> 00:42:08.265
without conversation,

611
00:42:08.266 --> 00:42:09.267
you understand?

612
00:42:10.235 --> 00:42:14.171
Sara will be working here
as a servant from now on.


613
00:42:14.172 --> 00:42:16.774
There will be no
communication exchanged.


614
00:42:16.775 --> 00:42:18.375
Is that clear?

615
00:42:18.376 --> 00:42:21.511
Yes, miss Minchin.

616
00:42:37.262 --> 00:42:39.230
7 times 5 is 35…

617
00:42:40.732 --> 00:42:44.101
7 times 6 is 42…

618
00:42:44.102 --> 00:42:45.637
Unh.

619
00:42:50.375 --> 00:42:54.713
7 times 9 is 63…

620
00:43:26.644 --> 00:43:28.146
Let go!

621
00:44:08.319 --> 00:44:10.420
Great god…

622
00:44:10.421 --> 00:44:11.789
It…it can't be.

623
00:44:11.790 --> 00:44:13.824
It's my son John.

624
00:44:13.825 --> 00:44:16.693
Oh, dear god, no.
Not John.


625
00:44:16.694 --> 00:44:19.129
It's John, ram dass.

626
00:44:19.130 --> 00:44:20.297
It's John.

627
00:44:20.298 --> 00:44:21.132
Help me.

628
00:44:21.133 --> 00:44:25.169
Go inside.
We should go.


629
00:44:34.212 --> 00:44:35.146
Oh.

630
00:44:35.147 --> 00:44:37.783
I thought you'd be sleeping.

631
00:44:38.884 --> 00:44:40.284
I never got a chance

632
00:44:40.285 --> 00:44:42.954
to give you your
birthday present.


633
00:44:44.890 --> 00:44:45.890
It's a picture

634
00:44:45.891 --> 00:44:47.992
of where you used to live.

635
00:44:47.993 --> 00:44:49.760
See the blue threads?

636
00:44:49.761 --> 00:44:51.830
That's the river.

637
00:44:52.931 --> 00:44:54.631
And these are the mountains

638
00:44:54.632 --> 00:44:55.665
you always talk about.

639
00:44:55.666 --> 00:44:58.702
Thank you, Becky.

640
00:44:58.703 --> 00:45:00.738
It's beautiful.

641
00:45:02.841 --> 00:45:05.109
Sara…

642
00:45:05.110 --> 00:45:07.845
why don't you tell
your stories anymore?


643
00:45:07.846 --> 00:45:10.447
They're just
make-believe.


644
00:45:10.448 --> 00:45:12.249
They don't mean anything.

645
00:45:12.250 --> 00:45:15.853
Oh, but they've always
meant something to me.


646
00:45:15.854 --> 00:45:18.122
There were days
I thought I would die


647
00:45:18.123 --> 00:45:20.690
until I heard you talk
about the magic.


648
00:45:20.691 --> 00:45:24.762
There is no magic, Becky.

649
00:45:45.183 --> 00:45:46.551
Papa…

650
00:45:47.819 --> 00:45:50.188
can you hear me?

651
00:45:51.589 --> 00:45:54.192
I'm so scared.

652
00:46:32.263 --> 00:46:33.263
Sara?

653
00:46:33.264 --> 00:46:35.833
Are you still a Princess?

654
00:46:36.667 --> 00:46:38.268
You better get back in line,

655
00:46:38.269 --> 00:46:40.704
or we'll both be in trouble.

656
00:46:40.705 --> 00:46:41.705
Are you?

657
00:46:41.706 --> 00:46:43.174
Lottie!

658
00:46:44.943 --> 00:46:47.112
All right, girls, get in line.

659
00:47:12.938 --> 00:47:14.338
Don't touch that!

660
00:47:14.339 --> 00:47:16.340
It's for Mr. Randolph
next door.


661
00:47:16.341 --> 00:47:19.809
The poor man. His son is
missing in action


662
00:47:19.810 --> 00:47:20.810
over in Europe, you know.

663
00:47:20.811 --> 00:47:22.112
You mean John?

664
00:47:22.113 --> 00:47:24.949
Oh, he's such a nice boy.

665
00:47:24.950 --> 00:47:26.750
Yeah, very nice.
Very fresh.


666
00:47:36.827 --> 00:47:38.528
Here, little girl.

667
00:47:38.529 --> 00:47:42.333
I told you not to give
your money away.


668
00:47:43.834 --> 00:47:45.835
She's not even a beggar.

669
00:47:45.836 --> 00:47:47.004
Excuse me.

670
00:47:47.005 --> 00:47:48.538
Excuse me.

671
00:47:48.539 --> 00:47:51.476
You see? You'll never
get rid of her.


672
00:47:55.513 --> 00:47:57.015
May I help you?

673
00:48:01.852 --> 00:48:04.454
Would you like to buy a flower?

674
00:48:04.455 --> 00:48:07.624
Would you like to buy a flower?

675
00:48:07.625 --> 00:48:09.559
Would you?

676
00:48:09.560 --> 00:48:10.827
No, thank you.

677
00:48:10.828 --> 00:48:12.896
Sir, would you buy a flower?

678
00:48:12.897 --> 00:48:14.199
One flower.

679
00:48:15.433 --> 00:48:18.002
Sir, would you like a flower?

680
00:48:18.003 --> 00:48:20.038
Would you like a flower?

681
00:48:21.472 --> 00:48:24.608
Would you like to buy a flower?

682
00:48:24.609 --> 00:48:25.543
Would you?

683
00:48:25.544 --> 00:48:29.846
Sir, would you like
to buy a flower?


684
00:48:29.847 --> 00:48:30.880
One flower?

685
00:48:30.881 --> 00:48:33.417
Would you like to buy a flower?

686
00:48:33.418 --> 00:48:36.920
Would you like a flower, Sir?

687
00:48:36.921 --> 00:48:37.921
Pardon me.

688
00:48:37.922 --> 00:48:40.125
Would you like a flower?

689
00:48:46.531 --> 00:48:48.365
Give her a flower.

690
00:48:48.366 --> 00:48:50.101
Wait.

691
00:48:56.641 --> 00:48:59.044
For the Princess.

692
00:49:02.213 --> 00:49:05.616
Would you like to buy a flower?

693
00:49:06.584 --> 00:49:10.421
A beautiful flower, Sir?
Beautiful day.


694
00:50:36.774 --> 00:50:39.276
What is it, little mouse?

695
00:50:39.277 --> 00:50:42.379
Are you a prisoner, too?

696
00:50:42.380 --> 00:50:43.781
Sara?

697
00:50:45.450 --> 00:50:49.653
Is it ever this cold
where you come from?


698
00:50:49.654 --> 00:50:51.455
No.

699
00:50:51.456 --> 00:50:54.458
Tell me about it, Sara.

700
00:50:54.459 --> 00:50:57.094
Tell me again about India.

701
00:51:02.533 --> 00:51:04.100
India.

702
00:51:04.101 --> 00:51:05.670
Tell me.

703
00:51:06.671 --> 00:51:07.971
Well…

704
00:51:07.972 --> 00:51:12.075
the air is so hot there,

705
00:51:12.076 --> 00:51:14.811
you can almost taste it.

706
00:51:14.812 --> 00:51:16.213
Mmm.

707
00:51:16.214 --> 00:51:18.948
I bet it tastes like coconuts.

708
00:51:18.949 --> 00:51:20.116
No.

709
00:51:20.117 --> 00:51:23.687
It's more like spices, really.

710
00:51:23.688 --> 00:51:26.556
Curry and saffron…

711
00:51:26.557 --> 00:51:27.725
what else?

712
00:51:31.962 --> 00:51:35.265
Tigers sleep under trees…

713
00:51:35.266 --> 00:51:39.369
and elephants cool
themselves in the lakes…


714
00:51:39.370 --> 00:51:43.840
and the warm wind
blows through the fields…


715
00:51:43.841 --> 00:51:46.243
and the spirits ride it,

716
00:51:46.244 --> 00:51:49.513
singing as they look down on us.

717
00:51:49.514 --> 00:51:53.850
And their voices echo
through the mountains…


718
00:51:53.851 --> 00:51:55.852
and the sky…

719
00:51:55.853 --> 00:51:59.055
is all different colors,

720
00:51:59.056 --> 00:52:02.125
like a peacock's tail.

00:54:06.452 --> 00:54:09.218
Oh, soot all over the place!

736
00:54:09.219 --> 00:54:11.220
You clumsy fool, get out!

737
00:54:11.221 --> 00:54:13.222
Get out of my house
this instant!


738
00:54:13.223 --> 00:54:16.292
And you can forget
being paid this week,


739
00:54:16.293 --> 00:54:18.028
crazy little wretch!

740
00:54:19.029 --> 00:54:20.564
Oh, no, you don't.

741
00:54:20.565 --> 00:54:21.798
I told you I wouldn't tolerate

742
00:54:21.799 --> 00:54:23.767
the slightest bit
of soot in this house!


743
00:54:23.768 --> 00:54:26.302
And there!
Just look at my boot!


744
00:54:26.303 --> 00:54:27.905
It's filthy!

745
00:54:29.306 --> 00:54:30.674
Out. Out!

746
00:54:30.675 --> 00:54:33.777
And take this ridiculous-
looking thing with you!


747
00:55:21.926 --> 00:55:23.493
Ohh…

748
00:55:23.494 --> 00:55:26.329
aah!

749
00:55:26.330 --> 00:55:28.231
Ohh…

750
00:55:40.645 --> 00:55:43.780
Where…where might miss
Amelia be this morning?


751
00:55:43.781 --> 00:55:45.515
Why, good morning, Frances.

752
00:55:45.516 --> 00:55:47.517
You're here early this morning.

753
00:55:47.518 --> 00:55:49.052
A working man's
got to get up early


754
00:55:49.053 --> 00:55:52.121
if he wants to have
an effect on the world.


755
00:55:52.122 --> 00:55:53.490
How true.

756
00:55:53.491 --> 00:55:56.994
And what a powerful
effect you have, Frances.


757
00:56:17.715 --> 00:56:18.749
Oh…

758
00:56:28.125 --> 00:56:29.126
hmph.

759
00:56:37.502 --> 00:56:39.435
Where have you been?

760
00:56:39.436 --> 00:56:42.171
I've been chilled
for almost half an hour.


761
00:56:42.172 --> 00:56:44.440
Hurry up and light a fire.

762
00:56:44.441 --> 00:56:46.442
And make sure not to
touch anything else


763
00:56:46.443 --> 00:56:47.711
with your dirty hands.

764
00:56:47.712 --> 00:56:49.579
This is my room now,

765
00:56:49.580 --> 00:56:52.149
and I won't have you
messing it up.


766
00:56:55.319 --> 00:56:56.586
Uhh…

767
00:56:56.587 --> 00:56:58.988
what is that awful smell?

768
00:56:58.989 --> 00:57:01.826
When was the last time
you had a bath?


769
00:57:07.397 --> 00:57:09.198
Rak-shash nayanas…

770
00:57:09.199 --> 00:57:10.299
what are you doing?

771
00:57:10.300 --> 00:57:11.367
Sha-khambala…

772
00:57:11.368 --> 00:57:13.837
I don't believe in this…

773
00:57:13.838 --> 00:57:17.842
so you can just stop it.
Stop it, I said!


774
00:57:22.112 --> 00:57:24.280
What did you just do?

775
00:57:24.281 --> 00:57:25.715
Just a little curse I learned

776
00:57:25.716 --> 00:57:27.283
from the witch back in India.

777
00:57:27.284 --> 00:57:29.085
Curse?

778
00:57:29.086 --> 00:57:30.620
Ha.

779
00:57:30.621 --> 00:57:32.355
What kind of curse?

780
00:57:32.356 --> 00:57:33.757
You'll see,

781
00:57:33.758 --> 00:57:37.094
but I wouldn't brush my
hair as much, if I were you.


782
00:57:50.240 --> 00:57:51.507
It's all right.

783
00:57:51.508 --> 00:57:54.510
I saved it especially for you.

784
00:57:54.511 --> 00:57:55.612
Go on.

785
00:57:55.613 --> 00:57:56.613
Take it.

786
00:58:19.837 --> 00:58:22.039
Oh…

787
00:58:23.407 --> 00:58:25.408
is this where you live?

788
00:58:25.409 --> 00:58:27.410
You shouldn't
be here, ermengarde.


789
00:58:27.411 --> 00:58:29.178
It's too dangerous.

790
00:58:29.179 --> 00:58:30.014
Sara,

791
00:58:30.015 --> 00:58:32.515
why don't you like me anymore?

792
00:58:32.516 --> 00:58:34.517
Did I do something wrong?

793
00:58:34.518 --> 00:58:36.519
No, of course not.

794
00:58:36.520 --> 00:58:39.122
I didn't think you'd
want me for a friend


795
00:58:39.123 --> 00:58:40.757
now that…

796
00:58:40.758 --> 00:58:42.959
now that things are different.

797
00:58:42.960 --> 00:58:43.960
Sara, no.

798
00:58:43.961 --> 00:58:45.795
I'm sure you could do just fine

799
00:58:45.796 --> 00:58:47.664
without me for a friend,

800
00:58:47.665 --> 00:58:50.533
but I couldn't
get along without you.


801
00:58:50.534 --> 00:58:52.401
Ermengarde…

802
00:58:52.402 --> 00:58:54.403
I'm sorry.
I should've known


803
00:58:54.404 --> 00:58:55.972
you wouldn't be like the others.

804
00:58:57.007 --> 00:58:57.808
What's that?

805
00:58:57.809 --> 00:59:00.077
One knock means I'm here…

806
00:59:01.045 --> 00:59:04.614
two knocks means all is well.

807
00:59:04.615 --> 00:59:07.050
Three knocks means
the coast is clear…


808
00:59:07.051 --> 00:59:09.653
the demon Minchinweed is asleep.

809
00:59:09.654 --> 00:59:12.388
Gosh, it all sounds
so adventurous.


810
00:59:12.389 --> 00:59:15.524
Look, Becky, we have a visitor.

811
00:59:15.525 --> 00:59:16.994
Hello, Becky.

812
00:59:18.062 --> 00:59:21.665
Oh, Sara, I miss
your stories so much.


813
00:59:21.666 --> 00:59:23.499
Won't you tell us what happened

814
00:59:23.500 --> 00:59:25.835
to Rama and the Princess?

815
00:59:25.836 --> 00:59:27.837
The smoke from Ravanna's arrows

816
00:59:27.838 --> 00:59:31.641
finally began to lift.

817
00:59:31.642 --> 00:59:33.877
Rama lay dead on the ground.

818
00:59:33.878 --> 00:59:35.812
Oh, no.
Oh, no.


819
00:59:35.813 --> 00:59:39.548
But then,
a wonderful thing happened.


820
00:59:39.549 --> 00:59:42.686
The gazelle lay down
next to Rama,


821
00:59:42.687 --> 00:59:45.022
giving him his own life.

822
00:59:56.366 --> 00:59:59.235
He is suffering
from acute amnesia,


823
00:59:59.236 --> 01:00:02.571
one of the rare side-effects
of poison gas.


824
01:00:02.572 --> 01:00:04.040
His eyes will heal in time…

825
01:00:04.041 --> 01:00:04.842
no, no, no!

826
01:00:04.843 --> 01:00:06.042
His memory…

827
01:00:06.043 --> 01:00:07.844
who can say?

828
01:00:07.845 --> 01:00:09.646
He's not my son.

829
01:00:11.448 --> 01:00:14.450
I-I'm sorry,
Mr. Randolph.


830
01:00:14.451 --> 01:00:16.452
He was found in severe shock,

831
01:00:16.453 --> 01:00:17.854
with no coat…

832
01:00:17.855 --> 01:00:19.723
no identification.

833
01:00:19.724 --> 01:00:23.126
Since your son was the
only name unaccounted for,


834
01:00:23.127 --> 01:00:25.930
they assumed this must be John.

835
01:00:27.464 --> 01:00:29.333
I am sorry.

836
01:00:38.608 --> 01:00:40.009
All the hoping…

837
01:00:40.010 --> 01:00:42.611
you must think me a fool.

838
01:00:42.612 --> 01:00:45.614
Is it your wish
to be wise, sahib?


839
01:00:45.615 --> 01:00:50.186
I don't know.
I suppose a wise man


840
01:00:50.187 --> 01:00:51.888
wouldn't have come here at all.

841
01:00:51.889 --> 01:00:53.489
But if he had,

842
01:00:53.490 --> 01:00:54.924
he would have looked
more closely


843
01:00:54.925 --> 01:00:57.094
upon the soldier's face.

844
01:00:58.896 --> 01:01:01.097
What would he have seen?

845
01:01:01.098 --> 01:01:02.631
Pain, sahib.

846
01:01:02.632 --> 01:01:06.502
He needs to be cared for.

847
01:01:06.503 --> 01:01:08.504
He's not my responsibility.

848
01:01:08.505 --> 01:01:10.039
A wise man would remember

849
01:01:10.040 --> 01:01:12.909
that this soldier
was in John's regiment.


850
01:01:12.910 --> 01:01:14.443
If his memory returns,

851
01:01:14.444 --> 01:01:18.715
he might tell sahib
what happened to his son.


852
01:01:20.050 --> 01:01:22.251
Perhaps sahib will learn

853
01:01:22.252 --> 01:01:24.888
that John is in British
hospital now,


854
01:01:24.889 --> 01:01:27.891
wishing that a kind man
would take him home…


855
01:01:27.892 --> 01:01:30.494
away from his pain.

856
01:01:34.198 --> 01:01:35.464
If the plumber comes

857
01:01:35.465 --> 01:01:36.565
while I'm at the bank,

858
01:01:36.566 --> 01:01:37.767
show him the problem.

859
01:01:37.768 --> 01:01:39.635
And don't babble
endlessly with the man.


860
01:01:39.636 --> 01:01:41.604
He's paid by the hour, you know.

861
01:01:41.605 --> 01:01:42.972
Oh, and make sure
those Latin tests


862
01:01:42.973 --> 01:01:45.308
are corrected by
the time I get back.


863
01:01:45.309 --> 01:01:46.777
Yes, sister.

864
01:01:51.816 --> 01:01:53.951
Hello, miss Minchin.

865
01:01:55.452 --> 01:01:57.187
Good-bye,
miss Minchin.


866
01:02:14.204 --> 01:02:15.204
Now.

867
01:02:15.205 --> 01:02:16.305
Go.

868
01:02:16.306 --> 01:02:20.209
Aah!

869
01:02:20.210 --> 01:02:22.211
Aah!

870
01:02:23.948 --> 01:02:26.015
Oh, no, lottie.
Not again.


871
01:02:26.016 --> 01:02:28.151
Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh.

872
01:02:28.152 --> 01:02:29.152
Aah!

873
01:02:29.153 --> 01:02:31.420
Aah!

874
01:02:31.421 --> 01:02:33.056
No, lottie. Not again.

875
01:02:33.057 --> 01:02:41.530
Aah!

876
01:02:41.531 --> 01:02:43.066
Aah!

877
01:02:43.067 --> 01:02:46.235
Aah!

878
01:02:46.236 --> 01:02:48.305
Aah!

879
01:02:52.843 --> 01:02:54.478
Let's find the locket.

880
01:02:56.313 --> 01:02:57.313
Aah!

881
01:02:57.314 --> 01:02:59.382
It's all right.

882
01:02:59.383 --> 01:03:00.383
It's OK.

883
01:03:00.384 --> 01:03:02.151
It's all right.

884
01:03:02.152 --> 01:03:04.487
Aah!

885
01:03:05.489 --> 01:03:06.522
Aah!

886
01:03:30.080 --> 01:03:31.814
Sara, come quick!

887
01:03:31.815 --> 01:03:33.951
It's lottie. I think
she's possessed!


888
01:04:04.448 --> 01:04:06.049
I…I got it.

889
01:04:11.121 --> 01:04:14.924
Will you please get
that child under control?


890
01:04:14.925 --> 01:04:17.294
Not to worry.
Everything's fine.


891
01:04:26.603 --> 01:04:27.938
Aah!

892
01:04:30.874 --> 01:04:33.209
I…

893
01:04:33.210 --> 01:04:34.210
I…

894
01:04:34.211 --> 01:04:35.778
I…

895
01:04:35.779 --> 01:04:37.246
I…

896
01:04:37.247 --> 01:04:38.614
I…

897
01:04:38.615 --> 01:04:39.748
I…

898
01:04:39.749 --> 01:04:41.617
I…I…

899
01:04:41.618 --> 01:04:42.918
I…

900
01:04:42.919 --> 01:04:44.520
I…

901
01:04:44.521 --> 01:04:45.588
I…

902
01:04:45.589 --> 01:04:47.090
I…

903
01:04:47.091 --> 01:04:48.925
Well, what is it?

904
01:04:50.894 --> 01:04:53.930
I thought I saw a mouse.

905
01:04:58.268 --> 01:04:59.668
Ohh!

906
01:04:59.669 --> 01:05:00.670
Huh?

907
01:05:09.446 --> 01:05:12.049
Aah!

908
01:05:13.850 --> 01:05:15.052
Hello.

909
01:05:20.290 --> 01:05:22.191
<i>♪ La Dee Dee
Dee Dee Dee Dee ♪</i>

910
01:05:22.192 --> 01:05:23.392
<i>♪ La Dee dee… ♪</i>

911
01:05:23.393 --> 01:05:24.061
I swear,

912
01:05:24.061 --> 01:05:24.995
that child has a pact

913
01:05:24.996 --> 01:05:26.529
with Satan to destroy me.

914
01:05:26.530 --> 01:05:28.264
I'm just not cut
out for this job.


915
01:05:28.265 --> 01:05:29.665
I have no Patience for children,

916
01:05:29.666 --> 01:05:32.868
and teaching…all those
horrible facts to remember.


917
01:05:32.869 --> 01:05:35.004
I don't like it at all.

918
01:05:35.005 --> 01:05:37.673
You like Frances,
though, don't you?


919
01:05:37.674 --> 01:05:39.442
What?

920
01:05:39.443 --> 01:05:40.843
Of course not.

921
01:05:40.844 --> 01:05:42.245
How dare you.

922
01:05:42.246 --> 01:05:43.979
I think he likes you, too.

923
01:05:43.980 --> 01:05:47.017
You do?

924
01:05:48.018 --> 01:05:49.252
Really?

925
01:05:49.253 --> 01:05:51.054
I think you should
run away together


926
01:05:51.055 --> 01:05:52.121
and get married.

927
01:05:52.122 --> 01:05:55.858
It would be terribly romantic.

928
01:05:55.859 --> 01:05:59.428
What an extraordinary
thing to say.


929
01:05:59.429 --> 01:06:01.597
I…

930
01:06:01.598 --> 01:06:02.798
I…

931
01:06:02.799 --> 01:06:04.400
I…

932
01:06:04.401 --> 01:06:05.469
I…

933
01:06:07.104 --> 01:06:09.405
Well, anyway…

934
01:06:09.406 --> 01:06:11.707
my sister would be furious
if she found out.


935
01:06:11.708 --> 01:06:12.708
So?

936
01:06:12.709 --> 01:06:15.111
You'd be long gone by then,

937
01:06:15.112 --> 01:06:17.880
living in some exotic paradise…

938
01:06:17.881 --> 01:06:20.383
with that dashing young milkman.

939
01:06:20.384 --> 01:06:22.151
Ohh.

940
01:06:22.152 --> 01:06:25.354
Well, I'd better get
to the market.


941
01:06:25.355 --> 01:06:26.423
Ohh.

942
01:06:32.329 --> 01:06:33.330
Ohh.

943
01:06:47.010 --> 01:06:49.578
You're doing well, young man.

944
01:06:49.579 --> 01:06:51.148
You're almost home.

945
01:06:53.417 --> 01:06:56.620
You must trust my eyes, sahib.

946
01:07:17.974 --> 01:07:19.576
Shh.

947
01:07:24.814 --> 01:07:26.282
What's going on?

948
01:07:26.283 --> 01:07:28.118
It's a surprise.

949
01:07:32.322 --> 01:07:34.357
What are you doing here?

950
01:07:34.358 --> 01:07:36.160
We brought you something.

951
01:07:40.330 --> 01:07:41.697
Princess Sara…

952
01:07:41.698 --> 01:07:44.200
we'd like to present you
with something we rescued.


953
01:07:44.201 --> 01:07:46.702
In a most dangerous adventure.

954
01:07:46.703 --> 01:07:48.003
Our very own crusade.

955
01:07:48.004 --> 01:07:49.938
Risking all our lives.

956
01:07:49.939 --> 01:07:52.142
And mine, too.

957
01:07:58.047 --> 01:07:59.315
I…

958
01:07:59.316 --> 01:08:02.186
I don't know what to say.

959
01:08:04.754 --> 01:08:09.225
You all are the best friends
anyone could ever ask for.


960
01:08:09.226 --> 01:08:12.127
Aah!
Aah!


961
01:08:12.128 --> 01:08:13.762
It's all right.

962
01:08:13.763 --> 01:08:18.033
That's just my little
monkey friend hanuman.


963
01:08:18.034 --> 01:08:20.836
Where did he come from?

964
01:08:20.837 --> 01:08:22.771
Right next door.
Look.


965
01:08:22.772 --> 01:08:26.175
Hanuman likes to come
and visit me all the time.


966
01:08:26.176 --> 01:08:28.711
Can you really
talk to him, Sara?


967
01:08:28.712 --> 01:08:29.646
Sure.

968
01:08:29.647 --> 01:08:32.548
Hanuman, say hello
to all my friends.


969
01:08:54.304 --> 01:08:56.605
After Rama came back to life,

970
01:08:56.606 --> 01:09:00.209
he raced on toward
the monster's palace


971
01:09:00.210 --> 01:09:01.977
to rescue Sita, but suddenly…

972
01:09:03.079 --> 01:09:06.014
Ravanna appeared.

973
01:09:06.015 --> 01:09:09.184
Aah!
Aah!


974
01:09:18.695 --> 01:09:22.665
I think we better save
the rest of the story


975
01:09:22.666 --> 01:09:23.767
for later.

976
01:09:35.912 --> 01:09:38.382
Hee hee hee.
Hee hee hee.


977
01:09:41.318 --> 01:09:43.218
What's going on here?

978
01:09:43.219 --> 01:09:46.021
It's not their fault.
I asked them to come.


979
01:09:46.022 --> 01:09:47.022
You five get downstairs

980
01:09:47.023 --> 01:09:48.056
immediately.

981
01:09:48.057 --> 01:09:49.826
I'll deal with you later.

982
01:09:51.027 --> 01:09:52.160
Becky…

983
01:09:52.161 --> 01:09:53.662
you will remain
locked in your room


984
01:09:53.663 --> 01:09:54.963
for the entire day tomorrow,

985
01:09:54.964 --> 01:09:56.665
without meals.

986
01:09:56.666 --> 01:09:57.667
Go!

987
01:10:00.203 --> 01:10:03.138
And you will perform
all her chores


988
01:10:03.139 --> 01:10:04.273
in addition to your own

989
01:10:04.274 --> 01:10:07.075
without breakfast,
lunch, or dinner.


990
01:10:07.076 --> 01:10:08.677
It's time you learn, Sara Crewe,

991
01:10:08.678 --> 01:10:10.479
that real life has nothing to do

992
01:10:10.480 --> 01:10:12.681
with your little fantasy games.

993
01:10:12.682 --> 01:10:15.284
It's a cruel, nasty
world out there,


994
01:10:15.285 --> 01:10:17.620
and it's our duty to
make the best of it,


995
01:10:17.621 --> 01:10:21.223
not to indulge in
ridiculous dreams,


996
01:10:21.224 --> 01:10:24.328
but to be productive and useful.

997
01:10:27.297 --> 01:10:30.567
Do you understand
what I'm saying?


998
01:10:32.836 --> 01:10:34.438
Yes, ma'am.

999
01:10:36.573 --> 01:10:37.607
Good.

1000
01:10:39.976 --> 01:10:42.011
But I don't believe in it.

1001
01:10:45.982 --> 01:10:46.916
Don't tell me

1002
01:10:46.917 --> 01:10:49.585
you still fancy
yourself a Princess!


1003
01:10:49.586 --> 01:10:50.454
Ha ha!

1004
01:10:50.455 --> 01:10:52.287
Good god, child,
look around you.


1005
01:10:52.288 --> 01:10:53.889
Or better yet,

1006
01:10:53.890 --> 01:10:55.792
look in the mirror.

1007
01:11:02.432 --> 01:11:05.067
I am a Princess.

1008
01:11:05.068 --> 01:11:06.835
All girls are…

1009
01:11:06.836 --> 01:11:10.172
even if they live
in tiny old attics,


1010
01:11:10.173 --> 01:11:13.241
even if they dress in rags,

1011
01:11:13.242 --> 01:11:14.810
even if they aren't pretty

1012
01:11:14.811 --> 01:11:17.079
or smart or young,

1013
01:11:17.080 --> 01:11:19.448
they're still princesses,

1014
01:11:19.449 --> 01:11:20.849
all of us.

1015
01:11:20.850 --> 01:11:24.887
Didn't your father
ever tell you that?


1016
01:11:24.888 --> 01:11:26.823
Didn't he?

1017
01:11:30.927 --> 01:11:32.260
If I find you up here

1018
01:11:32.261 --> 01:11:33.729
with any of the girls again,

1019
01:11:33.730 --> 01:11:36.332
I will throw you out
into the street!


1020
01:12:09.433 --> 01:12:11.534
What are we going to do?

1021
01:12:11.535 --> 01:12:15.370
A whole day with nothing to eat.

1022
01:12:15.371 --> 01:12:17.973
Don't cry, Becky.

1023
01:12:17.974 --> 01:12:19.508
I'm scared.

1024
01:12:19.509 --> 01:12:21.376
If Minchin throws me out,

1025
01:12:21.377 --> 01:12:23.412
I got no place to go.

1026
01:12:23.413 --> 01:12:26.214
That's not true.

1027
01:12:26.215 --> 01:12:28.050
I'm here with you.

1028
01:12:28.051 --> 01:12:31.286
I've always thought
of us as sisters.


1029
01:12:31.287 --> 01:12:32.788
You have?

1030
01:12:32.789 --> 01:12:35.257
Let's make a promise right now

1031
01:12:35.258 --> 01:12:37.125
to always look out
for each other.


1032
01:12:37.126 --> 01:12:38.595
It's a promise.

1033
01:12:40.997 --> 01:12:44.500
Now, what are we going
to do about food?


1034
01:12:44.501 --> 01:12:46.368
Starve, I guess.

1035
01:12:46.369 --> 01:12:50.338
No. There's only
one thing to do.


1036
01:12:50.339 --> 01:12:51.807
We'll eat a great feast

1037
01:12:51.808 --> 01:12:53.375
before we go to sleep,

1038
01:12:53.376 --> 01:12:55.210
and that will keep us full

1039
01:12:55.211 --> 01:12:56.411
all day tomorrow.

1040
01:12:56.412 --> 01:12:58.180
Feast?

1041
01:12:58.181 --> 01:12:59.448
What feast?

1042
01:12:59.449 --> 01:13:01.650
Just look around.

1043
01:13:01.651 --> 01:13:04.620
Do you see that table
over there?


1044
01:13:04.621 --> 01:13:07.490
It's covered with
a beautiful cloth


1045
01:13:07.491 --> 01:13:08.891
and candles

1046
01:13:08.892 --> 01:13:12.161
and trays and trays
of good things to eat.


1047
01:13:13.296 --> 01:13:15.063
Come on, Becky.

1048
01:13:15.064 --> 01:13:17.566
Tell me what kind
of food there is.


1049
01:13:17.567 --> 01:13:21.570
But I don't see any food.

1050
01:13:21.571 --> 01:13:23.572
Try, Becky.

1051
01:13:23.573 --> 01:13:25.574
Just make believe it.

1052
01:13:25.575 --> 01:13:29.779
Remember what you told
me about the magic?


1053
01:13:38.788 --> 01:13:40.088
Muffins?

1054
01:13:40.089 --> 01:13:42.224
Good! What kind?

1055
01:13:42.225 --> 01:13:43.626
All kinds…

1056
01:13:43.627 --> 01:13:46.629
every kind of muffin
god ever made,


1057
01:13:46.630 --> 01:13:48.831
and all of them hot.

1058
01:13:48.832 --> 01:13:49.966
Good!

1059
01:13:51.467 --> 01:13:52.467
Oh.

1060
01:13:52.468 --> 01:13:53.869
We're not dressed right

1061
01:13:53.870 --> 01:13:56.472
for such an elegant banquet.

1062
01:13:58.341 --> 01:14:01.844
I'm wearing a long, velvet cape

1063
01:14:01.845 --> 01:14:03.979
with fur on the collar.

1064
01:14:03.980 --> 01:14:05.047
How 'bout you?

1065
01:14:05.048 --> 01:14:08.216
Well, I always liked
diamonds myself…


1066
01:14:08.217 --> 01:14:09.552
rings and bracelets

1067
01:14:09.553 --> 01:14:11.954
and a whole dress
just covered with them.


1068
01:14:11.955 --> 01:14:13.922
Ha ha ha ha.

1069
01:14:13.923 --> 01:14:15.090
Mmm.

1070
01:14:15.091 --> 01:14:17.560
Smell those sausages.

1071
01:14:17.561 --> 01:14:19.361
Oh, I love sausages.

1072
01:14:58.501 --> 01:14:59.903
Mmm.

1073
01:15:33.903 --> 01:15:35.171
Ohh!

1074
01:15:37.607 --> 01:15:40.777
Mmm.

1075
01:15:44.313 --> 01:15:45.447
Becky!

1076
01:15:45.448 --> 01:15:46.650
Becky!

1077
01:15:50.754 --> 01:15:52.656
Oh, my lord.

1078
01:15:54.390 --> 01:15:56.725
I think you went
a little too far


1079
01:15:56.726 --> 01:15:57.760
this time.

1080
01:15:57.761 --> 01:15:59.595
It wasn't me.

1081
01:16:04.367 --> 01:16:05.702
Go ahead.

1082
01:16:18.782 --> 01:16:22.384
I feel like I've been
touched by an angel.


1083
01:16:22.385 --> 01:16:23.385
And look…

1084
01:16:23.386 --> 01:16:25.553
just what we ordered.

1085
01:16:25.554 --> 01:16:28.490
I'm a little scared
about all of this.


1086
01:16:28.491 --> 01:16:30.525
Me, too.

1087
01:16:30.526 --> 01:16:31.894
You think we shouldn't eat it?

1088
01:16:31.895 --> 01:16:33.797
I'm not that scared.

1089
01:16:45.975 --> 01:16:48.576
Thank you for all your kindness.

1090
01:16:48.577 --> 01:16:50.545
I'm so sorry
to inconvenience you.


1091
01:16:50.546 --> 01:16:52.181
It is nothing, sahib.

1092
01:16:58.087 --> 01:16:59.222
That word…

1093
01:17:01.390 --> 01:17:03.058
it sounds so familiar,

1094
01:17:03.059 --> 01:17:06.661
yet I don't know what it means.

1095
01:17:06.662 --> 01:17:07.863
It is not english.

1096
01:17:07.864 --> 01:17:11.266
We use it where I am from…

1097
01:17:11.267 --> 01:17:12.802
in India.

1098
01:17:15.471 --> 01:17:16.471
India.

1099
01:17:16.472 --> 01:17:18.674
You know it?

1100
01:17:21.310 --> 01:17:23.578
No.

1101
01:17:23.579 --> 01:17:25.448
Everything's just a blur.

1102
01:17:28.284 --> 01:17:31.486
Maybe someday
I'll sort it all out.


1103
01:17:31.487 --> 01:17:33.757
You will, sahib.

1104
01:17:35.258 --> 01:17:36.359
You will.

1105
01:18:27.510 --> 01:18:29.245
Pffft!

1106
01:18:33.649 --> 01:18:35.251
Yoo-hoo.

1107
01:18:49.532 --> 01:18:51.868
Hey. Frances.

1108
01:18:53.602 --> 01:18:55.504
One minute.

1109
01:19:02.378 --> 01:19:04.180
Oof!

1110
01:19:07.283 --> 01:19:08.885
Oof!

1111
01:19:20.830 --> 01:19:22.398
Oh, my god.

1112
01:19:23.732 --> 01:19:25.200
Oof!

1113
01:19:25.201 --> 01:19:27.336
Frances?

1114
01:19:35.611 --> 01:19:37.745
Where is it?

1115
01:19:37.746 --> 01:19:39.014
Where's the locket?

1116
01:19:39.015 --> 01:19:41.484
Give it to me.
Give it to me!


1117
01:19:44.353 --> 01:19:45.955
What is all this?

1118
01:19:47.156 --> 01:19:48.756
Where did it come from?

1119
01:19:48.757 --> 01:19:49.824
I don't know.

1120
01:19:49.825 --> 01:19:51.226
I just woke up, and it was here.

1121
01:19:51.227 --> 01:19:52.895
You stole all of it, didn't you?

1122
01:19:52.896 --> 01:19:54.362
Just like you stole this locket!

1123
01:19:54.363 --> 01:19:55.363
No!

1124
01:19:55.364 --> 01:19:57.565
You're nothing but
a dirty little thief.


1125
01:19:57.566 --> 01:19:58.833
It's my responsibility

1126
01:19:58.834 --> 01:20:00.435
to protect the children
of this school


1127
01:20:00.436 --> 01:20:01.436
from animals like you!

1128
01:20:01.437 --> 01:20:02.504
But, miss Minchin…

1129
01:20:02.505 --> 01:20:03.906
pack your things.

1130
01:20:03.907 --> 01:20:05.507
You'll be leaving
with the police


1131
01:20:05.508 --> 01:20:06.876
very shortly!

1132
01:20:08.011 --> 01:20:10.612
No, miss Minchin!

1133
01:20:10.613 --> 01:20:12.514
I didn't do it!

1134
01:20:12.515 --> 01:20:14.649
Miss Minchin, please!

1135
01:20:14.650 --> 01:20:18.254
Miss Minchin, I didn't do it!

1136
01:20:31.935 --> 01:20:33.068
You heard me.

1137
01:20:33.069 --> 01:20:35.538
I want her picked up
immediately!


1138
01:20:52.555 --> 01:20:53.956
Aha!

1139
01:20:53.957 --> 01:20:56.091
Ah, you've removed the bandages.

1140
01:20:56.092 --> 01:20:58.693
There didn't seem
to be much point.


1141
01:20:58.694 --> 01:21:00.095
I can see all right.

1142
01:21:00.096 --> 01:21:01.696
Yes, well, come on in.

1143
01:21:01.697 --> 01:21:02.965
Have a Brandy.

1144
01:21:02.966 --> 01:21:04.167
Thank you.

1145
01:21:17.446 --> 01:21:19.714
Don't worry.

1146
01:21:19.715 --> 01:21:22.117
I'm sure they'll believe you.

1147
01:21:22.118 --> 01:21:25.988
No, Becky!
I have to get out!


1148
01:21:25.989 --> 01:21:29.592
But how?
My room's locked, too.


1149
01:21:43.206 --> 01:21:44.940
The police!
They're here!


1150
01:21:46.942 --> 01:21:48.176
Let's go, boys!

1151
01:21:48.177 --> 01:21:50.379
All right.
Step lively now.


1152
01:22:03.993 --> 01:22:06.094
Quick! Help me
with this board!


1153
01:22:06.095 --> 01:22:07.996
Right this way.

1154
01:22:07.997 --> 01:22:09.465
Yes, ma'am.

1155
01:22:23.746 --> 01:22:25.780
Sara, you'll fall.

1156
01:22:25.781 --> 01:22:27.882
I can do it.

1157
01:22:27.883 --> 01:22:30.485
I'll come back for you.

1158
01:22:30.486 --> 01:22:32.221
I promise.

1159
01:22:36.659 --> 01:22:37.692
Ooh.

1160
01:22:37.693 --> 01:22:38.761
Who is he?

1161
01:22:59.715 --> 01:23:00.915
What is she doing?

1162
01:23:00.916 --> 01:23:04.153
Get back in here this instant!

1163
01:23:05.554 --> 01:23:07.555
Oh!

1164
01:23:07.556 --> 01:23:09.158
Aah!

1165
01:23:15.831 --> 01:23:17.032
Sara!

1166
01:23:31.347 --> 01:23:33.081
The little beast
is running away!


1167
01:23:33.082 --> 01:23:34.583
Don't try it, miss!

1168
01:23:41.357 --> 01:23:42.690
Sara!

1169
01:23:42.691 --> 01:23:43.758
Aah!

1170
01:23:43.759 --> 01:23:44.760
Aah!

1171
01:23:54.703 --> 01:23:55.804
Get help.

1172
01:24:15.057 --> 01:24:16.458
Well, don't just stand there!

1173
01:24:16.459 --> 01:24:18.627
Go next door and find her!

1174
01:24:20.028 --> 01:24:21.697
Quickly.

1175
01:24:23.366 --> 01:24:26.734
And take this one
while you're at it.


1176
01:24:26.735 --> 01:24:28.035
All right.

1177
01:24:41.917 --> 01:24:43.084
I heard you calling

1178
01:24:43.085 --> 01:24:45.453
in your sleep last night.

1179
01:24:45.454 --> 01:24:46.721
Sometimes when I dream,

1180
01:24:46.722 --> 01:24:50.192
I sense a part of me
that's missing.


1181
01:24:50.193 --> 01:24:51.626
It's a strange feeling

1182
01:24:51.627 --> 01:24:54.530
having your heart remember
something your mind cannot.


1183
01:24:57.366 --> 01:25:00.802
Seems like she jumped
like a little animal.


1184
01:25:03.406 --> 01:25:05.908
Who could that be at this hour?

1185
01:25:10.946 --> 01:25:12.347
Let us in, man.

1186
01:25:12.348 --> 01:25:15.350
A child from the school
has escaped into your house.


1187
01:25:15.351 --> 01:25:16.351
Ram dass, what's going on here?

1188
01:25:16.352 --> 01:25:17.752
I'm sorry to bother you,

1189
01:25:17.753 --> 01:25:19.821
but there's a child hiding
in your house unlawfully.


1190
01:25:19.822 --> 01:25:20.623
What?

1191
01:25:20.624 --> 01:25:22.691
Search the rooms upstairs!

1192
01:25:23.692 --> 01:25:24.959
Oh!
Oh!


1193
01:25:24.960 --> 01:25:26.361
Oh, not now!

1194
01:25:26.362 --> 01:25:28.963
Ram dass, get some candles!

1195
01:25:28.964 --> 01:25:30.299
Yes, sahib.

1196
01:25:32.501 --> 01:25:33.968
Start with the attic.

1197
01:25:33.969 --> 01:25:34.969
Let's go.

1198
01:25:34.970 --> 01:25:35.970
Right, Sir.

1199
01:25:35.971 --> 01:25:37.172
Quickly.

1200
01:25:39.242 --> 01:25:40.242
Who's there?

1201
01:26:06.602 --> 01:26:08.135
What is it?

1202
01:26:08.136 --> 01:26:10.306
Why are you crying?

1203
01:26:13.742 --> 01:26:17.880
Please tell me.
I won't hurt you.


1204
01:26:19.282 --> 01:26:21.484
Won't you tell me your name?

1205
01:26:28.891 --> 01:26:31.092
Sara.

1206
01:26:31.093 --> 01:26:32.961
Sara?

1207
01:26:34.229 --> 01:26:37.965
That's such a pretty name.

1208
01:26:37.966 --> 01:26:39.702
Sara.

1209
01:26:42.771 --> 01:26:44.473
Go to the next level!

1210
01:26:51.847 --> 01:26:53.549
Papa.

1211
01:27:00.856 --> 01:27:02.457
Papa.

1212
01:27:02.458 --> 01:27:04.592
What did you say?

1213
01:27:04.593 --> 01:27:05.394
Papa.

1214
01:27:05.395 --> 01:27:07.128
I'm sorry.

1215
01:27:07.129 --> 01:27:09.030
Papa, it's me!
It's Sara!


1216
01:27:09.031 --> 01:27:10.398
Sara, do you know me?

1217
01:27:10.399 --> 01:27:11.833
Oh, god, papa,
don't you remember me?


1218
01:27:11.834 --> 01:27:14.569
Papa, please! You've
got to know me!


1219
01:27:14.570 --> 01:27:16.671
It's Sara, remember?

1220
01:27:16.672 --> 01:27:19.140
Remember India?
And Maya?


1221
01:27:19.141 --> 01:27:21.809
Remember the Ramayana?
And Emily?


1222
01:27:21.810 --> 01:27:23.711
And the locket with
mama's picture in it?


1223
01:27:23.712 --> 01:27:24.513
No.

1224
01:27:24.514 --> 01:27:26.581
Oh, god, papa, please!

1225
01:27:26.582 --> 01:27:27.383
Sara!

1226
01:27:27.384 --> 01:27:28.516
Papa, please!

1227
01:27:28.517 --> 01:27:30.017
Do you know this man?

1228
01:27:30.018 --> 01:27:31.387
Papa, tell them!

1229
01:27:34.056 --> 01:27:36.458
This child has no father.

1230
01:27:36.459 --> 01:27:37.892
Take her away!

1231
01:27:37.893 --> 01:27:39.694
No!

1232
01:27:39.695 --> 01:27:41.128
No!

1233
01:27:41.129 --> 01:27:43.230
Papa!

1234
01:27:43.231 --> 01:27:44.832
I'm so sorry.

1235
01:27:44.833 --> 01:27:50.104
No! No! Papa!

1236
01:27:50.105 --> 01:27:54.876
Papa! Papa!

1237
01:27:54.877 --> 01:27:56.879
Papa!

1238
01:28:03.952 --> 01:28:05.720
Papa!

1239
01:28:05.721 --> 01:28:07.154
I got her.

1240
01:28:07.155 --> 01:28:08.222
Put me down!

1241
01:28:08.223 --> 01:28:09.624
Papa!

1242
01:28:09.625 --> 01:28:11.460
Sara!

1243
01:28:18.901 --> 01:28:20.267
Papa!

1244
01:28:20.268 --> 01:28:23.472
Papa, don't ever leave me!

1245
01:28:35.317 --> 01:28:37.018
Papa! I missed you!

1246
01:28:37.019 --> 01:28:38.554
I love you.

1247
01:28:55.270 --> 01:28:56.739
Sara!

1248
01:29:02.010 --> 01:29:04.513
Thank you.

1249
01:29:34.443 --> 01:29:36.444
Well, well, well.

1250
01:29:36.445 --> 01:29:38.446
Hardly recognized you.

1251
01:29:38.447 --> 01:29:40.848
I'm glad you straightened
everything out.


1252
01:29:40.849 --> 01:29:43.985
They released all
my property back to me.


1253
01:29:43.986 --> 01:29:46.588
I just came
to say good-bye, Sir,


1254
01:29:46.589 --> 01:29:49.757
and to thank you for
everything you've done for us.


1255
01:29:49.758 --> 01:29:53.095
No more than you tried
to do for my son.


1256
01:29:54.229 --> 01:29:55.630
Take care, Mr. Randolph.

1257
01:29:55.631 --> 01:29:57.499
And you, too.

1258
01:29:57.500 --> 01:29:59.934
You must be glad
to be going home.


1259
01:29:59.935 --> 01:30:03.070
Thank you.

1260
01:30:26.895 --> 01:30:30.364
I have a surprise for you all.

1261
01:30:30.365 --> 01:30:32.134
Emily!

1262
01:30:33.536 --> 01:30:35.269
Whenever you think of me,

1263
01:30:35.270 --> 01:30:36.671
just tell Emily,

1264
01:30:36.672 --> 01:30:38.940
and she'll get
the message to me.


1265
01:30:38.941 --> 01:30:40.542
And when you hug her,

1266
01:30:40.543 --> 01:30:41.909
you'll really be getting

1267
01:30:41.910 --> 01:30:43.545
a hug from me.

1268
01:30:43.546 --> 01:30:45.914
Then we'll hug her every day.

1269
01:30:46.915 --> 01:30:49.017
Ah.
Ah.


1270
01:31:20.315 --> 01:31:21.448
Bye, Becky.

1271
01:31:21.449 --> 01:31:22.584
Bye.

1272
01:31:22.585 --> 01:31:24.185
Come on.

1273
01:31:24.186 --> 01:31:26.320
Let's go.
Hurry up.


1274
01:31:26.321 --> 01:31:28.023
Hurry up.

1275
01:31:32.327 --> 01:31:34.461
Yeah, I'm coming, I'm coming.

1276
01:31:34.462 --> 01:31:36.463
Come on.
Get over here.


1277
01:31:36.464 --> 01:31:38.600
I've been looking
for you, Minchin.


1278
01:31:38.601 --> 01:31:39.867
Pick up the bucket.

1279
01:31:39.868 --> 01:31:41.102
Hey, when do I get my break?

1280
01:31:41.103 --> 01:31:43.004
Hey, follow me.

1281
01:31:43.005 --> 01:31:46.074
Oh… what did he
put in here, rocks?
