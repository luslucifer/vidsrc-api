1
00:01:33.723 --> 00:01:34.849
Until something happens...

2
00:01:34.932 --> 00:01:37.977
my plan is to stay in this wonderful bar
of ours and get drunk.


3
00:01:38.019 --> 00:01:41.147
The locals are torching your flag.

4
00:01:41.231 --> 00:01:42.315
You know, we should film them.

5
00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:45.110
When they burn something interesting
I will hit record.


6
00:01:45.193 --> 00:01:47.154
- Like the new President?
- Amirev?


7
00:01:47.195 --> 00:01:49.615
Amirev. The question is, will he last?

8
00:01:49.698 --> 00:01:51.575
<i>Well, he made it through the first week.</i>

9
00:01:51.658 --> 00:01:54.161
<i>The people love him
and he won the election fair and square.</i>


10
00:01:54.202 --> 00:01:58.123
<i>Our reluctant loser, Kirilov,
has other plans for Amirev.</i>


11
00:01:58.206 --> 00:01:59.291
Stop! IDs please.

12
00:01:59.374 --> 00:02:01.835
I'm here to collect Commander Sam Keenan.

13
00:02:02.169 --> 00:02:04.630
- Thank you, sir.
- Thank you.


14
00:02:06.715 --> 00:02:09.969
So, nobody's going to the airport
to pick up your new Ambassador?


15
00:02:10.052 --> 00:02:12.388
New second-in-command,
Deputy Ambassador...


16
00:02:12.429 --> 00:02:14.306
ain't worth changing shirts for.

17
00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:16.183
That's not who they're flying in today.

18
00:02:16.225 --> 00:02:18.561
I've heard it's the new military attaché.

19
00:02:18.811 --> 00:02:21.356
<i>Military attaché, interesting></i>

20
00:02:25.068 --> 00:02:28.821
<i>You know, word on the street is the militia
with Kirilov are planning a coup.</i>


21
00:02:28.904 --> 00:02:32.325
Amirev knows that he has
a serious insurgency problem on his hands.


22
00:02:32.408 --> 00:02:34.869
He also knows that his army
simply isn't up to handling it.


23
00:02:34.911 --> 00:02:35.995
Yeah, no shit.

24
00:02:36.079 --> 00:02:38.748
Which is exactly why
Norland requested this guy.


25
00:02:38.831 --> 00:02:42.544
<i>He's the kind of guy you definitely want
on your team if you're expecting trouble.</i>


26
00:02:42.627 --> 00:02:47.382
<i>And let's face it, the US are taking
this insurgency problem very seriously.</i>


27
00:02:50.427 --> 00:02:52.012
<i>So, who is he?</i>

28
00:02:52.846 --> 00:02:54.181
His name is Keenan.

29
00:02:54.265 --> 00:02:57.768
Commander Samuel Keenan. Navy SEAL.

30
00:02:58.352 --> 00:03:01.062
<i>He's the toughest guy I have ever met.</i>

31
00:03:01.605 --> 00:03:05.192
- Your bag, sir.
- Thank you.


32
00:03:05.275 --> 00:03:07.402
- Sounds like you know him.
- Yeah.


33
00:03:07.611 --> 00:03:10.572
Michelle and I embedded
with his team in El Basra.


34
00:03:10.614 --> 00:03:13.909
She however got to know him
a little better than I did.


35
00:03:13.993 --> 00:03:15.036
Sir.

36
00:03:15.119 --> 00:03:19.082
<i>Oh, not our super clean
Michelle "United World News" Whitman?</i>


37
00:03:19.165 --> 00:03:20.583
<i>The very same.</i>

38
00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.920
<i>Delta Four,
requesting clearance for take-off.</i>


39
00:03:25.588 --> 00:03:29.551
<i>Michelle told me that he's coming
by the hotel before he starts work.</i>


40
00:03:29.759 --> 00:03:31.635
<i>Lucky Miss Whitman.</i>

41
00:03:42.856 --> 00:03:46.526
- What's your name, Corporal?
- Butler, sir.


42
00:03:46.985 --> 00:03:49.237
Do you know the Hotel Continental?

43
00:03:49.947 --> 00:03:52.491
Sir, my orders were to take you
straight to the Embassy, sir.


44
00:03:52.574 --> 00:03:54.743
Then on to the Presidential Palace.

45
00:03:58.497 --> 00:04:01.292
But the hotel is
kind of on the way.

46
00:04:02.668 --> 00:04:04.628
In the opposite direction.

47
00:04:11.385 --> 00:04:14.054
- Give me an hour, okay?
- Yes, sir.


48
00:04:38.454 --> 00:04:39.706
Who is it?

49
00:04:52.469 --> 00:04:53.637
How are you?

50
00:05:47.317 --> 00:05:49.778
- You okay?
- I'm fine.


51
00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:53.657
- Hey, man.
- Journalist scum!


52
00:05:57.828 --> 00:05:59.038
Shit.

53
00:06:00.456 --> 00:06:01.415
Sam.

54
00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:05.086
Hey, buddy, stop.

55
00:06:05.128 --> 00:06:08.131
- Go home, we don't want you here!
- We're press!


56
00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:11.468
Foreigner news programs to leave!

57
00:06:24.314 --> 00:06:26.733
- Out the door!
- I'll follow, I'll follow!


58
00:06:49.005 --> 00:06:51.300
Get out of the way. 
You, get down.

59
00:06:51.884 --> 00:06:53.844
- Sir, you okay?
- I'm fine.


60
00:06:53.927 --> 00:06:56.138
- Get some ambulances, now.
- Yes, sir.


61
00:06:56.221 --> 00:06:57.431
You, come on, let's get out of here.

62
00:06:57.514 --> 00:06:59.975
Michelle, you better come with me.
You'll be safe at the Embassy.


63
00:07:00.059 --> 00:07:02.311
- I'm a reporter, Sam.
- Like him.


64
00:07:02.353 --> 00:07:04.856
You know where the phone is?
You, answer me.


65
00:07:04.939 --> 00:07:06.149
You want to be next?

66
00:07:06.232 --> 00:07:08.484
If we don't show the world
what's happening, who will?


67
00:07:08.568 --> 00:07:10.487
Sam, you know me well enough by now.

68
00:07:10.528 --> 00:07:11.738
Sir, Civil Guards are on their way.

69
00:07:11.821 --> 00:07:14.741
You should not be here when they arrive.
Let's go.


70
00:07:14.825 --> 00:07:17.910
Stay off the streets
and let me find out what's going on.


71
00:07:17.994 --> 00:07:19.537
Don't worry, Sam, we'll be fine.

72
00:07:19.620 --> 00:07:21.706
Michelle, I'll come back for you.

73
00:07:45.064 --> 00:07:47.650
Jesus Christ, that's gotta be a bomb.

74
00:07:48.025 --> 00:07:50.694
- What's there?
- It's the army barracks.


75
00:07:51.486 --> 00:07:54.698
This country is supposed to be stable.
They just had elections.


76
00:07:54.782 --> 00:07:58.118
Well, someone didn't like the result.
Move on.


77
00:08:46.294 --> 00:08:49.172
Gunnery Sergeant Darnell.
Commander Sam Keenan.


78
00:08:49.255 --> 00:08:50.715
Gunnery Sergeant.

79
00:08:51.299 --> 00:08:53.218
Gunny will do just fine, sir.

80
00:08:54.760 --> 00:08:57.638
- Nice town, huh?
- Sleepy.


81
00:08:57.805 --> 00:09:00.558
It has its moments. 
Good to meet you, sir.

82
00:09:03.060 --> 00:09:05.855
Commander Keenan. 
I'm Jennifer Lennard.

83
00:09:05.938 --> 00:09:08.441
- Nice to meet you.
- Right this way, please.


84
00:09:08.816 --> 00:09:11.319
Ambassador Norland
speaks very highly of you.


85
00:09:11.361 --> 00:09:13.154
George? He's a good man.

86
00:09:13.446 --> 00:09:16.950
I get the feeling this town
is going to need him more than ever.


87
00:09:23.082 --> 00:09:24.792
He's right through here.

88
00:09:35.010 --> 00:09:37.095
Sam, how are you, son?

89
00:09:37.179 --> 00:09:39.431
Ambassador, sorry, 
I got delayed.

90
00:09:39.515 --> 00:09:41.850
Our RSO, John Lydon.

91
00:09:42.142 --> 00:09:44.019
Marine Detachment Commander
John Baldwin.


92
00:09:44.103 --> 00:09:46.814
Our new military attaché,
Commander Keenan.


93
00:09:46.856 --> 00:09:49.275
Welcome to the deep end,
Commander Keenan.


94
00:09:49.484 --> 00:09:50.985
Here's the top sheet.

95
00:09:51.194 --> 00:09:55.323
A small cadre of insurgents, former military
and loyal to ex-president Kirilov...


96
00:09:55.365 --> 00:09:57.826
are stirring up opposition
to the new president.


97
00:09:57.867 --> 00:09:59.869
This man is their leader, Tavarov...

98
00:09:59.952 --> 00:10:02.663
who obviously ordered the hit
on the journalists' hotel.


99
00:10:02.747 --> 00:10:06.876
They're hardliners,
old school communist, violently anti-US.


100
00:10:06.959 --> 00:10:10.004
But mainly street corner show boaters,
until now.


101
00:10:14.801 --> 00:10:17.471
- Comrade Tavarov.
- It's time, now.


102
00:10:18.013 --> 00:10:19.681
- Luca.
- Sir.


103
00:10:20.390 --> 00:10:21.516
Move in.

104
00:10:51.839 --> 00:10:53.299
You sure you're all right to do this?

105
00:10:53.383 --> 00:10:55.844
Your boyfriend was pretty insistent
that we stay out of trouble.


106
00:10:55.927 --> 00:10:57.554
Well, trouble has a way of finding me.

107
00:10:57.637 --> 00:10:59.306
How do you think I met him
in the first place?


108
00:10:59.389 --> 00:11:02.392
This place is about to blow, you can feel it.
Come on.


109
00:11:07.897 --> 00:11:09.190
Ambassador.

110
00:11:10.149 --> 00:11:12.777
Frank Gaines. CIA Station Chief.

111
00:11:12.861 --> 00:11:15.614
Our new military attaché,
Commander Keenan.


112
00:11:16.156 --> 00:11:18.033
They still call you B.C.?

113
00:11:18.950 --> 00:11:19.951
What do you mean?

114
00:11:20.035 --> 00:11:24.039
Well, you go to a hotel, a half hour later
we have a body count of eight.


115
00:11:24.998 --> 00:11:28.544
- Frank, Sam is on our side.
- So were those dead reporters.


116
00:11:29.462 --> 00:11:32.214
Now, what's your intel on the gunmen
and the bombers?


117
00:11:32.298 --> 00:11:37.094
Well, we have one major explosion
and three smaller blasts.


118
00:11:37.678 --> 00:11:41.390
My contacts report roving bands of militia,
maybe as many as 500.


119
00:11:41.473 --> 00:11:43.934
They've taken out
the military barracks here...


120
00:11:43.976 --> 00:11:46.479
and the Civil Guard HQ here.

121
00:11:47.438 --> 00:11:49.899
They've shot up US business interests too.

122
00:11:50.149 --> 00:11:52.819
We have unconfirmed American casualties.

123
00:11:53.903 --> 00:11:55.488
What about the rest of the army?

124
00:11:55.572 --> 00:11:57.949
President Amirev sent General Borgov...

125
00:11:57.991 --> 00:12:00.952
to take out what we thought
was a militia base camp.


126
00:12:01.536 --> 00:12:05.123
Satellite pictures show
he's turned back from the mountains...


127
00:12:05.666 --> 00:12:07.876
so I'd say five hours, minimum.

128
00:12:09.168 --> 00:12:12.797
I'll give you three to one on Amirev
swinging from a rope by midnight.


129
00:12:21.223 --> 00:12:23.183
As the capital falls into anarchy...

130
00:12:23.225 --> 00:12:26.854
the rioters have cut the President off
from both his military and police.


131
00:12:26.937 --> 00:12:31.359
Amirev needs his army who are reportedly
hours away in the mountains.


132
00:12:42.911 --> 00:12:44.872
- Yes, Comrade.
- Shoot.


133
00:12:44.955 --> 00:12:45.998
Yes, sir.

134
00:13:06.562 --> 00:13:10.149
- Where did that come from?
- One of the Palace Guards has opened fire.


135
00:13:24.746 --> 00:13:27.207
- You getting any of this?
- Yeah, all of it.


136
00:13:29.043 --> 00:13:30.878
They're storming the palace.

137
00:13:59.949 --> 00:14:02.536
"Our palace guards have opened fire
Mr. President."


138
00:14:04.538 --> 00:14:09.001
"On my own people?
Who gave such an order?"


139
00:14:09.084 --> 00:14:11.420
"They are jumpy sir.
It's understandable."


140
00:14:12.755 --> 00:14:16.842
"My army could restore order immediately,
yet they are still hours away."


141
00:14:17.260 --> 00:14:20.137
"But sir, we've lost contact
with General Borgov."


142
00:14:20.971 --> 00:14:23.849
"The airport is open.
I have organized a plane for you."


143
00:14:23.932 --> 00:14:28.604
"A plane?
When all other options are closed?"


144
00:14:28.687 --> 00:14:32.692
"Why does so obvious an escape
remain open to me?"


145
00:14:33.818 --> 00:14:35.278
"Have Captain Servat come in."

146
00:14:35.319 --> 00:14:37.447
"You must leave now, sir."

147
00:14:39.198 --> 00:14:42.160
"Put my Chief of Staff under arrest."

148
00:14:44.871 --> 00:14:45.872
"Mr. President?"

149
00:14:45.956 --> 00:14:47.290
"I don't need his advice any longer."

150
00:14:47.374 --> 00:14:49.376
"Mr. President!"

151
00:14:53.254 --> 00:14:55.048
Ambassador Norland, please.

152
00:14:56.132 --> 00:14:59.719
<i>The militia are clearly encouraging
the people to press forward.</i>


153
00:15:12.983 --> 00:15:16.862
How many marines do we have?
How many people do we have to protect?


154
00:15:16.904 --> 00:15:19.156
Officially an Embassy staff of 27.

155
00:15:19.198 --> 00:15:23.327
Plus 42 other US nationals in the city,
mostly oil and telecom engineers.


156
00:15:23.660 --> 00:15:25.829
Marine Embassy Guard detachment of 15.

157
00:15:25.871 --> 00:15:27.915
Fifteen? That's it?

158
00:15:27.998 --> 00:15:31.293
This was not considered
a hazardous duty station.


159
00:15:31.377 --> 00:15:33.713
- Look outside, Mr. Gaines.
- I know.


160
00:15:33.796 --> 00:15:35.506
That was President Amirev.

161
00:15:35.715 --> 00:15:37.842
Communists are storming
the Presidential Palace.


162
00:15:37.884 --> 00:15:40.845
- And?
- He wants our help.


163
00:15:40.970 --> 00:15:43.431
So, tell him people
in hell want ice cubes.

164
00:15:43.515 --> 00:15:45.475
How many weapons and transport
do we have?


165
00:15:45.558 --> 00:15:46.768
Whoa, hold on a second there, B.C.

166
00:15:46.852 --> 00:15:49.146
I see where you're going with this.
It's not going to happen.


167
00:15:49.229 --> 00:15:51.607
Sir, the Secretary of State
would have our asses.


168
00:15:51.690 --> 00:15:53.859
If we're gonna do something,
we're better to move now.


169
00:15:53.901 --> 00:15:57.028
- Yeah, yeah, well, with all due respect...
- Hear him out, Gaines.


170
00:15:57.111 --> 00:15:59.280
Those marines see any action?

171
00:15:59.364 --> 00:16:03.034
Gunny, Butler, and Zanger
all spent a tour in Iraq.


172
00:16:03.118 --> 00:16:06.621
Works for me. Get me in, 
I'll get him out.

173
00:16:08.081 --> 00:16:09.041
Do it.

174
00:16:10.709 --> 00:16:11.794
Follow me.

175
00:16:14.129 --> 00:16:15.256
Sam.

176
00:16:15.756 --> 00:16:18.384
Since we still haven't replaced
my former deputy...


177
00:16:18.467 --> 00:16:21.220
I'm appointing you
to temporarily fill the slot.


178
00:16:21.429 --> 00:16:23.431
You're my new second-in-command.

179
00:16:39.113 --> 00:16:40.615
Less protesters back here.

180
00:16:40.657 --> 00:16:42.742
- It's fully loaded, sir.
- Thank you.


181
00:16:42.784 --> 00:16:45.286
Pull up here,
I should be able to go this way.


182
00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:51.752
Service entrance to the palace.

183
00:16:51.835 --> 00:16:55.422
Shit, those Palace Guards
look like they've got their hands full.


184
00:16:58.175 --> 00:16:59.634
Make sure they keep holding.

185
00:17:08.602 --> 00:17:10.103
There's Sam.

186
00:17:39.842 --> 00:17:41.636
You're the gentleman
who will assist my travel?


187
00:17:41.719 --> 00:17:44.180
Yes, sir. Where is your driver?

188
00:18:03.326 --> 00:18:04.534
Follow me.

189
00:18:07.954 --> 00:18:09.248
<i>Sam, we've got a problem.</i>

190
00:18:09.331 --> 00:18:12.584
Mobs coming through. They're storming
through the service office door.


191
00:18:18.507 --> 00:18:20.176
Switching to Plan "B."

192
00:18:21.010 --> 00:18:22.178
Follow me.

193
00:18:49.331 --> 00:18:51.541
Baldwin, cover us when we come out.

194
00:18:51.583 --> 00:18:53.085
<i>Copy, Sam, we're right behind you.</i>

195
00:18:53.126 --> 00:18:54.127
We've got movement.

196
00:18:54.211 --> 00:18:56.255
With just a handful of guards
protecting the palace...


197
00:18:56.338 --> 00:18:58.090
and his most loyal generals
many hours away...


198
00:18:58.173 --> 00:19:01.469
the feeling in the insurgents
is one of "now or never."


199
00:19:26.995 --> 00:19:28.329
God, Sam!

200
00:19:47.557 --> 00:19:49.309
Keep your head down, sir.

201
00:20:29.184 --> 00:20:30.685
Let's get out of here.

202
00:20:31.770 --> 00:20:33.480
Yeah, we're out of here.

203
00:20:35.399 --> 00:20:36.692
Tavarov.

204
00:20:37.526 --> 00:20:39.069
<i>Cover the US Embassy.</i>

205
00:20:43.824 --> 00:20:45.867
<i>This is Tiger One,
we got your back here.</i>

206
00:20:48.870 --> 00:20:50.831
<i>Let's roll back to the Embassy, sir.</i>

207
00:20:50.872 --> 00:20:54.668
Copy that. Hang back and cover our flank.

208
00:20:57.045 --> 00:21:01.967
<i>- Gunny, we're coming in. Cover us.
- Roger, Sam. Ready to deploy.</i>


209
00:21:07.974 --> 00:21:10.268
Watch it, we're cut off.

210
00:21:10.560 --> 00:21:12.061
<i>I got the rear, Sam.</i>

211
00:21:12.979 --> 00:21:14.981
Hold on, sir, I'll get you out.

212
00:21:18.234 --> 00:21:19.527
Brace yourself.

213
00:21:24.699 --> 00:21:25.908
I got it, go!

214
00:21:35.627 --> 00:21:37.421
Move out, cover the street!

215
00:21:38.171 --> 00:21:39.631
Pazzini, cover me!

216
00:21:51.101 --> 00:21:53.645
- Take him out!
- I've got it, go!


217
00:22:01.028 --> 00:22:02.738
Get up on the wall.

218
00:22:07.368 --> 00:22:09.078
Coming in from the left.

219
00:22:18.129 --> 00:22:20.132
Coming around, move!

220
00:22:23.175 --> 00:22:26.679
- Mr. President, are you okay?
- I'm fine.


221
00:22:26.763 --> 00:22:28.890
Okay, come on.

222
00:22:29.224 --> 00:22:32.519
Sir, we'll have to make
a run for it, okay?

223
00:22:38.275 --> 00:22:40.194
Grenade, give me your grenade!

224
00:22:43.072 --> 00:22:44.990
Go, get the hell out of here.

225
00:22:52.749 --> 00:22:54.833
Only shoot on my orders!

226
00:22:56.210 --> 00:22:58.879
Follow me. Go, go! Cover!

227
00:23:02.007 --> 00:23:04.719
Fire! Fire!

228
00:23:11.726 --> 00:23:14.062
Get those goddamn gates open!

229
00:23:19.901 --> 00:23:21.153
Over here!

230
00:23:24.573 --> 00:23:26.949
Incoming fire! Get down!

231
00:23:37.043 --> 00:23:38.587
Close the gates!

232
00:23:43.550 --> 00:23:45.052
They're pulling back.

233
00:23:45.886 --> 00:23:48.055
Welcome to the USA, Mr. President.

234
00:23:48.139 --> 00:23:50.474
Thank you. I am in your debt.

235
00:23:50.766 --> 00:23:53.519
Sir, the Ambassador is waiting inside.

236
00:23:54.062 --> 00:23:55.021
Sir.

237
00:23:56.731 --> 00:24:00.275
Corporal Zanger just radioed in.
He and Pazzini are still out there.


238
00:24:00.359 --> 00:24:02.486
I'll assemble a reaction team
and bring them both in.


239
00:24:02.570 --> 00:24:04.029
Negative, Gunny.

240
00:24:04.113 --> 00:24:07.199
The city is crawling with militia
heading in our direction.


241
00:24:07.283 --> 00:24:08.868
I need all available men right now.

242
00:24:08.951 --> 00:24:10.953
Zanger and Pazzini are two of my best.

243
00:24:11.037 --> 00:24:13.373
I'm sure they are, and they're marines.

244
00:24:14.249 --> 00:24:17.544
- I'm counting on them out there.
- Yes, sir.


245
00:24:44.363 --> 00:24:48.617
Jones, left flank, 
Red, right flank!

246
00:24:48.784 --> 00:24:50.077
Move!

247
00:24:50.244 --> 00:24:51.704
Hold your position.

248
00:24:52.622 --> 00:24:56.042
<i>Attention, please, all civilian evacuees...</i>

249
00:24:56.125 --> 00:24:59.337
<i>please assemble in the lobby
for a security briefing.</i>


250
00:24:59.421 --> 00:25:00.672
- Here you go.
- Hi.


251
00:25:01.423 --> 00:25:04.008
- Don't worry about me, I'll be fine.
- Are you sure?


252
00:25:04.592 --> 00:25:06.344
Hell of a time for a tour group.

253
00:25:06.427 --> 00:25:10.306
They're US nationals who work in the city.
We bussed them in for their own safety.


254
00:25:10.389 --> 00:25:13.685
We need to get control of our defenses.
Is there a map of this place?


255
00:25:13.768 --> 00:25:16.020
Yeah, the Marine Unit
is down the hall and to the left.


256
00:25:16.104 --> 00:25:18.148
ACR is in the basement through Comms.

257
00:25:18.231 --> 00:25:20.775
Come with me,
I'll show you the Embassy plans.


258
00:25:20.859 --> 00:25:24.863
<i>Would evacuees please remain in the lobby
and await further instructions.</i>


259
00:25:39.836 --> 00:25:41.964
They re-grouped
at the top of the street, Gunny.


260
00:26:04.196 --> 00:26:06.990
Enough ammo to hold off
a troop of girl scouts.


261
00:26:07.449 --> 00:26:10.993
Yeah, and the only anti-personnel weapon
we've got is bad breath.


262
00:26:12.829 --> 00:26:14.539
I've spotted an RPG.

263
00:26:17.208 --> 00:26:19.586
I'll give the Ambassador the great news.

264
00:26:22.798 --> 00:26:25.884
Now, we do this the hard way.

265
00:26:27.886 --> 00:26:29.596
We don't have much time.

266
00:26:34.769 --> 00:26:37.438
<i>Let us know immediately
if there's any change in your plans.</i>


267
00:26:44.403 --> 00:26:46.530
- Incoming!
- Get down!


268
00:27:06.676 --> 00:27:07.844
- You okay?
- Yeah.


269
00:27:07.928 --> 00:27:10.305
- Call for backup, seal the windows.
- Right, sir.


270
00:27:12.224 --> 00:27:14.058
You two, on me!

271
00:27:25.821 --> 00:27:28.240
Get him downstairs into the bubble, now!

272
00:27:29.533 --> 00:27:30.576
You okay?

273
00:27:43.631 --> 00:27:44.841
Norland!

274
00:27:52.014 --> 00:27:54.600
Norland. Fuck, Norland.

275
00:27:54.767 --> 00:27:55.935
What, Sam?

276
00:27:55.977 --> 00:28:00.732
Medic! Medic! Please, here.

277
00:28:01.149 --> 00:28:03.443
Please, what's the damage?

278
00:28:04.569 --> 00:28:06.238
They hit us with RPGs.

279
00:28:06.321 --> 00:28:08.657
- Let me take a look at you.
- No.


280
00:28:09.491 --> 00:28:11.535
You're gonna be okay. Hold on.

281
00:28:11.660 --> 00:28:13.537
I don't think I'm going to make it.

282
00:28:14.246 --> 00:28:15.956
Best to leave this in.

283
00:28:17.249 --> 00:28:21.795
Amirev is inside the bubble.
He's safe. For now.


284
00:29:08.427 --> 00:29:10.345
Sir, this is Marshall Geller at Comms Tech.

285
00:29:10.387 --> 00:29:11.889
- Hey, Marshall.
- Sir.


286
00:29:14.600 --> 00:29:16.143
How is the President?

287
00:29:16.310 --> 00:29:18.521
...any background information,
anything you know.


288
00:29:18.562 --> 00:29:19.689
He's good.

289
00:29:25.819 --> 00:29:28.989
White House situation room, you're on.
Ready, sir.


290
00:29:29.198 --> 00:29:30.616
This is Sam Keenan.

291
00:29:31.450 --> 00:29:34.703
I regret to inform you
that Ambassador Norland has been...


292
00:29:34.745 --> 00:29:36.330
<i>killed in the Embassy attack.</i>

293
00:29:36.414 --> 00:29:38.791
Richard Hammond, 
Secretary of State.

294
00:29:38.875 --> 00:29:42.003
Our sympathies, Commander Keenan.
How did this happen?


295
00:29:42.420 --> 00:29:43.713
<i>A coup d'etat is in progress.</i>

296
00:29:43.755 --> 00:29:46.883
Amirev is in the Embassy
and we've been hit with an RPG.


297
00:29:46.925 --> 00:29:49.010
John Franklin, NSA.

298
00:29:49.094 --> 00:29:50.679
<i>How is your security?</i>

299
00:29:50.762 --> 00:29:54.266
We are surrounded by militia
loyal to Kirilov. I need backup.


300
00:29:54.349 --> 00:29:55.683
<i>This is General Anderson.</i>

301
00:29:55.766 --> 00:29:57.769
Our nearest Marine Expeditionary Unit...

302
00:29:57.852 --> 00:30:00.772
<i>is about six hours due east
of your current position.</i>


303
00:30:00.813 --> 00:30:02.857
You folks are just gonna have
to do whatever you can...


304
00:30:02.941 --> 00:30:05.110
to hold the fort until they can arrive.

305
00:30:05.193 --> 00:30:06.278
Understood.

306
00:30:07.154 --> 00:30:09.740
And if you don't
mind sir, on the double.

307
00:30:10.282 --> 00:30:11.283
Copy that.

308
00:30:11.366 --> 00:30:12.534
<i>Commander Keenan...</i>

309
00:30:12.618 --> 00:30:14.912
we'll keep the lines open for you
here at State...


310
00:30:14.995 --> 00:30:16.997
the Pentagon and Ops Center CIA.

311
00:30:17.081 --> 00:30:21.335
Let us know immediately if there's
any change in your plans, or your situation.


312
00:30:21.419 --> 00:30:22.587
Good luck.

313
00:30:25.131 --> 00:30:26.883
This is General Anderson.

314
00:30:27.174 --> 00:30:30.594
I'm issuing orders
for the 22nd Marine Expeditionary Unit.


315
00:30:30.636 --> 00:30:34.348
To proceed with an emergency
Embassy Reinforcement Mission.


316
00:30:41.814 --> 00:30:43.608
O'Brien, check the message.

317
00:30:52.242 --> 00:30:53.618
Message relayed.

318
00:30:59.415 --> 00:31:02.877
<i>This is Fort Victory.
Message received and understood, over.</i>


319
00:31:05.672 --> 00:31:07.883
Go, go, go! Move, move, move! Scramble!

320
00:31:07.966 --> 00:31:09.843
Move your ass! 
Move your ass!

321
00:31:13.889 --> 00:31:15.432
<i>We're ready to go.</i>

322
00:31:24.400 --> 00:31:26.069
<i>Delta 11, ready.</i>

323
00:31:27.403 --> 00:31:29.864
<i>The birds are in the air.</i>

324
00:31:30.949 --> 00:31:33.075
<i>Delta 13, birds are flying.</i>

325
00:31:34.326 --> 00:31:37.163
<i>All right, boys.
Sit tight, you've got a long ride.</i>


326
00:31:42.627 --> 00:31:45.797
Raise your hand if you feel confident
about our security.


327
00:31:49.384 --> 00:31:51.928
What we do have is an E&E plan.

328
00:31:52.012 --> 00:31:54.681
You heard my discussion
with the Secretary of State.


329
00:31:54.765 --> 00:31:55.891
Case closed.

330
00:31:55.974 --> 00:31:58.685
Evacuation is our only option.

331
00:31:58.894 --> 00:32:01.063
The longer we delay the harder it'll become.

332
00:32:01.146 --> 00:32:04.023
The evacuation plan
was designed for a staff of 15.


333
00:32:04.232 --> 00:32:05.775
We have over 50 people here.

334
00:32:05.859 --> 00:32:07.694
And a full on siege outside.

335
00:32:07.777 --> 00:32:10.906
How long do we have until
General Borgov returns with his troops?


336
00:32:10.989 --> 00:32:12.199
About four hours.

337
00:32:12.282 --> 00:32:14.868
By then we'll have militia
trying on our pants for size.


338
00:32:14.910 --> 00:32:19.165
Ambassador Norland said he would not
let this fragile democracy fail.


339
00:32:20.332 --> 00:32:22.335
I'm not going to let him down.

340
00:32:22.793 --> 00:32:24.170
We hold the fort.

341
00:32:25.171 --> 00:32:27.882
I hate to piss
on your little parade, Keenan...

342
00:32:28.091 --> 00:32:29.634
but Norland is dead.

343
00:32:30.260 --> 00:32:31.636
Jesus, am I the only one here...

344
00:32:31.720 --> 00:32:34.055
who thinks life would be rosier
on the other side of that mob?


345
00:32:34.097 --> 00:32:35.891
Evac is not an option.

346
00:32:36.266 --> 00:32:39.143
Vietnam is history, pal, get over it.

347
00:32:39.226 --> 00:32:41.103
Frank, you're not being helpful.

348
00:32:41.187 --> 00:32:43.398
Helpful is not sacrificing
more American lives...


349
00:32:43.439 --> 00:32:45.400
in a hopeless situation, John.

350
00:32:45.441 --> 00:32:48.069
This guy has been
in country less than a day.


351
00:32:48.445 --> 00:32:49.946
What does he know?

352
00:32:51.531 --> 00:32:54.326
<i>Sir, you'd better come to the TCU.</i>

353
00:32:55.619 --> 00:32:56.703
On my way.

354
00:33:13.262 --> 00:33:15.514
- They broke in on Channel 4.
- How?


355
00:33:15.723 --> 00:33:18.934
Don't know, he won't talk to me.
He just wants the man in charge.


356
00:33:26.275 --> 00:33:28.069
This is Sam Keenan. Over.

357
00:33:28.236 --> 00:33:32.157
I said I only want to speak to man in charge.
The Ambassador.


358
00:33:32.407 --> 00:33:35.368
He was killed. 
I'm in charge.

359
00:33:37.162 --> 00:33:38.705
My name is Tavarov.

360
00:33:39.331 --> 00:33:42.041
I represent
the Revolutionary People's Government.


361
00:33:42.125 --> 00:33:44.919
We demand the release
of President Yuri Amirev.


362
00:33:45.003 --> 00:33:48.423
To stand a trial for the murder
of innocent civilians.


363
00:33:48.757 --> 00:33:52.219
Gunned down on his order
outside the palace.


364
00:33:52.302 --> 00:33:53.303
<i>Over.</i>

365
00:33:53.386 --> 00:33:56.139
Amirev is under our protection,
which is US soil.


366
00:33:56.348 --> 00:34:00.310
If he did commit those crimes,
there are proper and legal ways to proceed.


367
00:34:00.352 --> 00:34:04.190
Not at the point of a gun.
That's how it works in a democracy.


368
00:34:04.273 --> 00:34:05.274
<i>Over.</i>

369
00:34:08.819 --> 00:34:12.615
We have demanded the release
of President Amirev.


370
00:34:16.952 --> 00:34:18.662
Look outside, Mr. Keenan.

371
00:34:19.038 --> 00:34:20.623
<i>In front of your gate.</i>

372
00:34:20.956 --> 00:34:23.459
Shit. The roof.

373
00:34:29.382 --> 00:34:31.009
You got a minute, John?

374
00:34:35.055 --> 00:34:37.349
Why did the Vietnam reference
get him so riled?


375
00:34:37.390 --> 00:34:38.683
He was born there.

376
00:34:38.767 --> 00:34:41.728
His mother was part
of the French Diplomatic Mission.


377
00:34:41.770 --> 00:34:43.981
His old man was some jarhead officer...

378
00:34:44.064 --> 00:34:46.107
who bought a bullet
when we pulled out of Saigon.


379
00:34:46.190 --> 00:34:50.070
- No wonder he's not big on evac.
- No. But he's big on ego.


380
00:34:50.904 --> 00:34:52.697
This guy is a loose cannon.

381
00:34:52.906 --> 00:34:56.284
<i>We just went from George Norland
to George of the Jungle.</i>


382
00:34:59.204 --> 00:35:01.165
I'm going back channel on this.

383
00:35:01.790 --> 00:35:03.959
You might consider doing the same thing.

384
00:35:04.043 --> 00:35:07.213
If you wanna save this place
and everybody in it.


385
00:35:31.321 --> 00:35:32.822
Out! Get out!

386
00:35:35.283 --> 00:35:36.493
Get out!

387
00:35:48.172 --> 00:35:51.216
Redwood Two, we got three hostages
including one woman...


388
00:35:51.299 --> 00:35:53.176
being held at gunpoint. Over.

389
00:36:25.001 --> 00:36:27.753
Yeah, that's General Illienev.

390
00:36:29.630 --> 00:36:31.424
Other guy looks like press.

391
00:36:31.716 --> 00:36:34.677
- And that woman.
- Michelle.


392
00:36:34.761 --> 00:36:37.180
- Michelle Whitman.
- Of course it is.


393
00:36:37.305 --> 00:36:38.974
- United World News.
- Yeah.


394
00:36:40.892 --> 00:36:43.645
Mr. Tavarov, if we are going to talk...

395
00:36:44.354 --> 00:36:46.482
release the hostages now.

396
00:36:46.941 --> 00:36:48.609
Our demands are clear.

397
00:36:48.901 --> 00:36:52.488
Release President Amirev into our custody.

398
00:36:52.989 --> 00:36:56.658
Or these people will be executed.

399
00:36:56.908 --> 00:37:00.537
Can I remind you, the Geneva Convention,
about prisoners of war?


400
00:37:01.205 --> 00:37:04.583
Unless I am mistaken,
we are not at war.

401
00:37:04.708 --> 00:37:07.169
The hostages are innocent civilians.

402
00:37:07.253 --> 00:37:09.046
Then release our President.

403
00:37:10.548 --> 00:37:12.049
It's very simple.

404
00:37:12.341 --> 00:37:14.427
He's not fucking around.

405
00:37:15.553 --> 00:37:18.681
Our position on that is clear, Mr. Tavarov.

406
00:37:19.057 --> 00:37:20.058
Over.

407
00:38:01.850 --> 00:38:03.560
You have 15 minutes.

408
00:38:03.602 --> 00:38:06.105
Then we will kill them both.

409
00:38:06.146 --> 00:38:10.985
<i>Then you are next, Mr. Keenan.
You and everyone inside the Embassy.</i>


410
00:38:11.194 --> 00:38:15.865
<i>We are taking our country back.
How we do it, it is up to you.</i>


411
00:38:24.291 --> 00:38:25.709
We have no choice.

412
00:38:26.501 --> 00:38:28.128
You read my mind, sir.

413
00:38:28.504 --> 00:38:31.548
I'm going to have to park
those thoughts about Beyoncé.


414
00:38:32.090 --> 00:38:36.136
- What are you thinking, Keenan?
- We're going out there for a rescue.


415
00:38:36.469 --> 00:38:38.138
Gunny, what have we got?

416
00:38:38.305 --> 00:38:41.016
We got two Recon Marines,
two trained snipers.


417
00:38:41.641 --> 00:38:44.895
If we can create a diversion,
we can get those hostages back.


418
00:38:45.103 --> 00:38:48.774
- You don't have anything big enough.
- You're right. Two men in the field.


419
00:38:49.483 --> 00:38:51.569
The best they can
do is to draw fire.

420
00:38:51.652 --> 00:38:54.113
I know it hurts to agree with me,
but let me finish.


421
00:38:54.155 --> 00:38:57.742
You don't have anything big enough,
but I do.


422
00:38:58.326 --> 00:39:02.288
A little insurance policy I've been hiding
by the name of Charlie Four.


423
00:39:05.833 --> 00:39:08.794
<i>Tiger One, this is Redwood One. Come in.</i>

424
00:39:08.878 --> 00:39:10.796
Tiger One. Over.

425
00:39:10.838 --> 00:39:13.633
<i>- What's your location?
- Baktiar Street.</i>


426
00:39:14.634 --> 00:39:17.595
- Are you mobile?
- Just four legs between us.


427
00:39:20.515 --> 00:39:21.558
Okay, gentlemen.

428
00:39:21.641 --> 00:39:26.229
<i>There is a bicycle store on Plechia Street,
which is two blocks east.</i>


429
00:39:26.355 --> 00:39:27.814
Okay, we'll find it.

430
00:39:27.898 --> 00:39:31.860
The owner is gonna ask your name.
Tell him, "Michael Jordan."


431
00:39:31.944 --> 00:39:34.655
Call us when you're inside,
and guys, haul ass.


432
00:39:36.031 --> 00:39:37.574
Okay, let's move.

433
00:40:00.556 --> 00:40:01.558
Sir...

434
00:40:02.934 --> 00:40:06.146
a man calling himself Tavarov
just killed a hostage.


435
00:40:06.229 --> 00:40:09.774
More hostages will be killed
unless I turn you over.


436
00:40:11.734 --> 00:40:13.986
- I need a straight answer.
- Please.


437
00:40:14.320 --> 00:40:17.198
Did you order your guards
to shoot at the people at your palace?


438
00:40:17.282 --> 00:40:20.160
No. Let me explain something.

439
00:40:21.036 --> 00:40:22.537
These men are brutal.

440
00:40:23.205 --> 00:40:25.582
We fought against them, 10 years.

441
00:40:25.665 --> 00:40:27.709
<i>Suffered their abuses for more than 20.</i>

442
00:40:27.793 --> 00:40:31.505
If I thought surrendering myself
to them would stop the bloodshed...


443
00:40:31.880 --> 00:40:33.090
I would do it.

444
00:40:34.508 --> 00:40:36.218
But the opposite is true.

445
00:40:36.886 --> 00:40:39.972
Only by defying them
can I protect my people.


446
00:40:40.640 --> 00:40:43.725
I'm very sorry you're caught in the middle,
Mr. Keenan.


447
00:40:44.101 --> 00:40:47.020
Whatever you decide, 
I will understand.

448
00:40:48.105 --> 00:40:50.399
- Thank you.
- My army is coming.


449
00:41:21.222 --> 00:41:25.602
<i>This is General Borgov's 18th battalion
en route to the American Embassy.</i>


450
00:41:25.769 --> 00:41:29.773
<i>Our ETA will be in four hours. 
Do you copy?</i>

451
00:41:33.402 --> 00:41:38.032
<i>This is General Borgov's 18th battalion
en route to the American Embassy.</i>


452
00:41:38.616 --> 00:41:42.120
<i>Our ETA will be four hours. Over.</i>

453
00:41:57.593 --> 00:41:59.887
Hi, Michael Jordan.

454
00:42:01.180 --> 00:42:04.309
- Good to meet you. Follow me.
- Okay.


455
00:42:06.353 --> 00:42:07.812
You got the radio?

456
00:42:09.773 --> 00:42:11.441
Here's the C4.

457
00:42:11.858 --> 00:42:14.194
Great, thanks. All right.

458
00:42:15.279 --> 00:42:18.364
Watch our backs.
You squawk twice if there's a problem.


459
00:42:18.448 --> 00:42:21.326
If we're being followed,
you're found, whatever.


460
00:42:21.785 --> 00:42:23.662
- Understand.
- Okay.


461
00:42:23.703 --> 00:42:25.831
Let's get this thing on the road.

462
00:42:59.407 --> 00:43:00.950
<i>Bike is in position.</i>

463
00:43:20.012 --> 00:43:22.014
Tiger One. All set. Over.

464
00:43:22.098 --> 00:43:23.181
<i>Redwood One.</i>

465
00:43:23.264 --> 00:43:24.516
Copy. All set.

466
00:43:24.683 --> 00:43:26.101
On my command.

467
00:43:26.434 --> 00:43:30.188
Three, two, one, go.

468
00:43:34.109 --> 00:43:35.736
Cover! Cover!

469
00:43:47.874 --> 00:43:49.167
Move!

470
00:43:49.959 --> 00:43:51.252
Go, go, go!

471
00:43:54.506 --> 00:43:57.425
Go, go! Get the hostages! Get down!

472
00:44:00.136 --> 00:44:01.429
Move out!

473
00:44:05.767 --> 00:44:07.185
Quick, move!

474
00:44:11.648 --> 00:44:13.775
Come on, guys! Let's go!

475
00:44:17.279 --> 00:44:20.449
Hustle! Man down! Come on!

476
00:44:20.991 --> 00:44:22.868
Get him up. Come on.

477
00:44:23.411 --> 00:44:26.539
Let's move them out, come on!
Let's move it!


478
00:44:28.665 --> 00:44:30.083
Come on, hurry up!

479
00:44:34.213 --> 00:44:35.464
Quick!

480
00:44:36.715 --> 00:44:40.261
Here! Need some help here!

481
00:44:40.636 --> 00:44:42.221
- Medic!
- Medic!


482
00:44:43.014 --> 00:44:44.891
There's a man still out there, sir.

483
00:44:50.146 --> 00:44:51.189
Sir.

484
00:45:10.542 --> 00:45:12.294
Come on, Mateo, let's go.

485
00:45:48.873 --> 00:45:51.084
Come on. I think
we can make it back.

486
00:45:54.588 --> 00:45:55.756
Close the door.

487
00:46:22.741 --> 00:46:25.703
Get the medics in reception. 
We got injured.

488
00:46:28.080 --> 00:46:30.166
- You all right, sir?
- Oh, God, my leg.


489
00:46:31.125 --> 00:46:33.169
- You'll be fine.
- I need morphine.


490
00:46:38.299 --> 00:46:40.551
- Are you okay?
- Take it easy, take it easy.


491
00:46:41.010 --> 00:46:43.512
- Baldwin, get the medics.
- Sir.


492
00:46:43.596 --> 00:46:44.972
And secure the compound.

493
00:46:45.056 --> 00:46:46.891
- Keep on holding, Mateo.
- Move!


494
00:46:46.975 --> 00:46:48.393
Suck it up.

495
00:46:49.018 --> 00:46:50.687
It's great to have you back barking orders...

496
00:46:50.770 --> 00:46:52.856
but we need intel
faster than they need a Band-Aid.


497
00:46:52.939 --> 00:46:55.275
- You two are reporters, right?
- Yeah.


498
00:46:55.484 --> 00:46:57.569
How many troops did they bring
to the palace?


499
00:46:57.652 --> 00:46:59.947
Fifty, a hundred, 
I have no idea.

500
00:47:00.030 --> 00:47:04.368
We were filming and then they came after us
and we just ran.


501
00:47:04.451 --> 00:47:05.911
And the rest of the Civic Guard?

502
00:47:05.995 --> 00:47:10.415
There were these men arriving in trucks
carrying AK-47 s and they fired at them.


503
00:47:10.498 --> 00:47:13.710
- You recognize firearms?
- Research is part of my job.


504
00:47:13.794 --> 00:47:15.629
Okay, good.
What other equipment did you see?


505
00:47:15.712 --> 00:47:17.256
- Did they have tanks?
- No tanks.


506
00:47:17.339 --> 00:47:20.217
- Any heavy armory?
- No. We just saw trucks.


507
00:47:20.384 --> 00:47:24.054
What about the leader, Tavarov?
Did he try to hurt you?


508
00:47:24.764 --> 00:47:26.724
Did he say he planned to shoot you?

509
00:47:26.807 --> 00:47:30.478
No. The opposite.
He said he would be happy to release us.


510
00:47:35.191 --> 00:47:39.488
I want to see both of you in my office
when you're finished.


511
00:47:39.779 --> 00:47:40.989
Gunny.

512
00:47:51.499 --> 00:47:53.752
What's General Borgov's position?

513
00:47:53.835 --> 00:47:55.879
He's still 120 miles away.

514
00:47:56.546 --> 00:47:59.758
With heavy armor, I'd say,
three and a half hours.


515
00:47:59.841 --> 00:48:01.927
They're still mopping up the dead out there.

516
00:48:02.052 --> 00:48:05.347
Corporal Chevanton puts their casualties
at 25 dead, 12 wounded.


517
00:48:05.431 --> 00:48:06.974
That will not stop Tavarov.

518
00:48:07.057 --> 00:48:10.937
No, he'll know help is on its way.
It's just going to speed things up.


519
00:48:11.604 --> 00:48:14.147
He'll hit us with everything they've got.

520
00:48:15.065 --> 00:48:17.109
Unless we give them what they want.

521
00:48:17.192 --> 00:48:18.652
- Gunny?
- Sure.


522
00:48:19.445 --> 00:48:22.448
I'll give them what they want.
So long as they want hell.


523
00:48:24.784 --> 00:48:27.245
Marine's balls for frigging brains.

524
00:48:27.328 --> 00:48:30.164
Hey, we got the hostages back, didn't we?

525
00:48:35.295 --> 00:48:36.546
Keenan.

526
00:48:38.423 --> 00:48:41.134
Your mandate here
is not to turn this into the Alamo.


527
00:48:41.218 --> 00:48:42.594
Great movie.

528
00:48:42.761 --> 00:48:45.055
Sure. But everybody died.

529
00:48:45.764 --> 00:48:48.057
We got Texas, didn't we?

530
00:48:53.271 --> 00:48:55.232
Sir, we've got movement.

531
00:49:00.487 --> 00:49:02.823
Yes, we have all that under control now.
Yeah.


532
00:49:02.906 --> 00:49:03.866
Can you guys...

533
00:49:12.083 --> 00:49:13.334
Incoming!

534
00:49:22.426 --> 00:49:25.262
<i>Post Five has been hit.
They got the comms array.</i>


535
00:49:31.602 --> 00:49:34.439
- The comms are out.
- We need to update Washington.


536
00:49:34.564 --> 00:49:36.775
See if they can give us something else.
Come on, move.


537
00:49:36.816 --> 00:49:39.694
- I'll have to rig the Satphone.
- Let's go.


538
00:49:54.876 --> 00:49:56.378
Just be a minute.

539
00:50:08.849 --> 00:50:10.226
Got a lock.

540
00:50:10.768 --> 00:50:12.478
Washington. Do you copy? Over.

541
00:50:12.645 --> 00:50:14.814
<i>This is General Anderson. 
Copy that.</i>

542
00:50:14.939 --> 00:50:17.817
Yeah. Patch me through
to the Secretary of State.


543
00:50:17.942 --> 00:50:19.527
<i>This is Secretary Hammond.</i>

544
00:50:19.611 --> 00:50:22.072
What is your current situation? Over.

545
00:50:22.155 --> 00:50:25.157
Sir, militia forces destroyed
our communication center.


546
00:50:25.241 --> 00:50:27.576
Sir, Mr. Secretary, this is Frank Gaines, CIA.

547
00:50:27.660 --> 00:50:29.829
We are outnumbered by over 20 to 1
at the moment.


548
00:50:29.871 --> 00:50:31.664
We have no cover on three sides...

549
00:50:31.748 --> 00:50:34.542
and the militia may have seized
government tanks and heavy weapons.


550
00:50:34.626 --> 00:50:37.921
- Yeah, but...
- Sir, with relief forces still hours away...


551
00:50:38.004 --> 00:50:40.257
and General Borgov's army out of contact...

552
00:50:40.340 --> 00:50:43.301
I strongly urge that we reconsider
the plan to evacuate...


553
00:50:43.385 --> 00:50:45.304
and take advantage of imminent night cover.

554
00:50:45.387 --> 00:50:47.681
That's an opinion
which I cannot support, sir.


555
00:50:47.723 --> 00:50:50.976
Would you stand by for a moment,
Commander Keenan?


556
00:50:55.772 --> 00:50:58.733
Sir, I think you should
take a look at this.

557
00:51:03.822 --> 00:51:06.283
Gentlemen, we have a problem here.

558
00:51:07.243 --> 00:51:08.536
Commander Keenan.

559
00:51:08.577 --> 00:51:11.747
<i>This department has not received
official notification...</i>


560
00:51:11.831 --> 00:51:16.294
that you've replaced Captain Baldwin
as acting Deputy Chief of Mission. Over.


561
00:51:16.377 --> 00:51:17.754
I'm not getting you, sir.

562
00:51:17.837 --> 00:51:20.507
<i>The cable replacing Captain Baldwin...</i>

563
00:51:20.590 --> 00:51:23.176
<i>as acting Deputy Chief of Mission
was never sent.</i>


564
00:51:23.426 --> 00:51:26.054
Officially, he is in charge, not you.

565
00:51:26.680 --> 00:51:29.056
I am hereby ordering you to assist him...

566
00:51:29.307 --> 00:51:30.641
<i>in any way you can.</i>

567
00:51:30.766 --> 00:51:33.645
<i>Could you put Captain Baldwin on the line?</i>

568
00:51:34.270 --> 00:51:35.855
This is Captain Baldwin.

569
00:51:35.939 --> 00:51:38.441
What is your assessment
of the merits of an E&E?


570
00:51:38.525 --> 00:51:42.112
I cannot guarantee the safety
of anyone in this facility.


571
00:51:42.279 --> 00:51:45.991
I would therefore agree
that evacuation would be advisable.


572
00:51:47.409 --> 00:51:50.746
Captain Baldwin,
you are authorized to proceed.


573
00:51:54.750 --> 00:51:58.546
<i>This is Delta 13, we are en route
and ETA is three hours. Over.</i>


574
00:52:38.128 --> 00:52:40.171
I heard the staff talking.

575
00:52:41.423 --> 00:52:44.468
- And?
- They say we're moving out.


576
00:52:44.885 --> 00:52:46.303
Is that so?

577
00:52:46.845 --> 00:52:48.597
Sam, if we stay, we're dead.

578
00:52:48.680 --> 00:52:51.100
If we go, we're
ducks in a shooting gallery.

579
00:52:51.183 --> 00:52:52.977
Well, it's Baldwin's call now.

580
00:52:53.060 --> 00:52:55.438
Michelle, Baldwin is a good guy.

581
00:52:55.563 --> 00:52:57.899
But he's never been in a combat situation.

582
00:52:57.982 --> 00:52:59.442
But this is his turf.

583
00:53:01.027 --> 00:53:02.695
This is your life.

584
00:53:03.154 --> 00:53:05.656
Does it ever occur to you
that you might be wrong?


585
00:53:05.739 --> 00:53:07.282
Not this time.

586
00:53:07.700 --> 00:53:11.746
You know, it's okay to run
when you have explored all the options.


587
00:53:15.666 --> 00:53:17.335
We'll talk about this later.

588
00:53:24.175 --> 00:53:25.510
I tried to warn you.

589
00:53:25.594 --> 00:53:28.513
We don't have time to build a horse
or dig a tunnel.


590
00:53:28.597 --> 00:53:31.099
We don't have to. 
Someone already did.

591
00:53:31.183 --> 00:53:32.559
Talk to me.

592
00:53:41.401 --> 00:53:44.070
Now, here's a little something for you.

593
00:53:44.905 --> 00:53:45.947
What is it?

594
00:53:46.031 --> 00:53:49.535
Paranoid bastards built all kinds of shit
under the city.


595
00:53:49.618 --> 00:53:51.870
Bomb shelters, command posts.

596
00:53:52.121 --> 00:53:54.748
More tunnels than the New York subway.

597
00:53:55.750 --> 00:53:57.209
That's lucky for us.

598
00:53:57.251 --> 00:53:58.336
All stations.

599
00:53:58.461 --> 00:53:59.879
<i>Harry is open. Over.</i>

600
00:54:00.880 --> 00:54:03.424
Birch One to all staff. 
Initiate final burn.

601
00:54:08.388 --> 00:54:12.224
Just the sensitive stuff. Bag it all.
Burn it to the furnace.


602
00:54:19.649 --> 00:54:22.861
<i>Attention all personnel. Please
make your way to the first floor lobby...</i>


603
00:54:22.944 --> 00:54:25.697
<i>- and prepare for immediate evacuation.
- And then they told me the situation...</i>


604
00:54:25.697 --> 00:54:27.073
All quiet up here.

605
00:54:32.579 --> 00:54:33.705
Stop there.

606
00:54:42.964 --> 00:54:45.092
Tiger One. Transport ETA.

607
00:54:46.176 --> 00:54:48.136
Tiger Two, ready. Out.

608
00:55:00.483 --> 00:55:03.695
Tiger One,
tunnel exit located and secure. Over.


609
00:55:11.036 --> 00:55:12.204
Just keep it moving.

610
00:55:14.330 --> 00:55:17.708
Hey, folks, about a quarter mile
till we reach open air.


611
00:55:17.792 --> 00:55:19.168
Stay tight.

612
00:55:25.842 --> 00:55:27.052
Come on, let's go.

613
00:55:27.135 --> 00:55:29.596
Look, I'll give you the details
of the evac plan...


614
00:55:29.679 --> 00:55:32.349
when we're on the bus
and out of the city.

615
00:55:32.432 --> 00:55:35.394
So, if you could just
take your place in line.

616
00:55:35.477 --> 00:55:36.937
I'm staying.

617
00:55:37.479 --> 00:55:41.317
That would be contradicting a direct order
from the Secretary of State.


618
00:55:41.442 --> 00:55:44.779
Tavarov will want a point of contact
inside the embassy.


619
00:55:44.862 --> 00:55:48.907
Let it go, Keenan.
Face it, pal, you just weren't up to the job.


620
00:55:49.199 --> 00:55:53.120
<i>Redwood Two. The men are briefed
for a tactical withdrawal. Out.</i>


621
00:55:53.203 --> 00:55:54.330
Birch One. Copy that.

622
00:55:57.541 --> 00:55:59.001
Suit yourself, tough guy.

623
00:56:03.089 --> 00:56:04.841
It'll be all right.

624
00:56:04.924 --> 00:56:06.217
This way.

625
00:56:07.177 --> 00:56:09.930
There are two more coming through. Over.

626
00:56:16.478 --> 00:56:18.855
Tavarov's men are still gathering out front.

627
00:56:18.980 --> 00:56:21.691
Right. By the time he's inside,
we'll have a half-hour head start.


628
00:56:21.733 --> 00:56:24.486
I'll just divert the Marine Expeditionary Units
to the new away point...


629
00:56:24.527 --> 00:56:27.197
and then we chopper out the civilians.
Simple.


630
00:56:28.740 --> 00:56:30.492
You made the right decision.

631
00:56:32.035 --> 00:56:33.203
Yeah.

632
00:56:37.333 --> 00:56:40.002
Redwood Two.
Clarify status, Tiger One. Over.


633
00:56:48.720 --> 00:56:49.804
Sir.

634
00:56:59.272 --> 00:57:01.524
This way. Keep moving, please.

635
00:57:25.507 --> 00:57:27.550
If you boys go AWOL again...

636
00:57:29.136 --> 00:57:30.637
I'm gonna kick your ass.

637
00:57:30.721 --> 00:57:34.975
Yeah, you get stuck in a hole again,
I ain't gonna save your sorry ass.


638
00:57:35.058 --> 00:57:36.393
Follow me.

639
00:57:36.602 --> 00:57:37.853
Let's go.

640
00:57:42.775 --> 00:57:45.319
Redwood Two.
Clarify status, Tiger One. Over.


641
00:57:45.403 --> 00:57:47.280
<i>Tiger One. Hatch is open. Over.</i>

642
00:57:57.081 --> 00:57:58.332
Come on.

643
00:58:07.175 --> 00:58:08.259
There it is.

644
00:58:08.635 --> 00:58:11.471
Redwood Two.
Go, go, go. Stay low, stay low.


645
00:58:12.138 --> 00:58:14.224
All right, let's get up there and cover.

646
00:58:17.185 --> 00:58:18.437
Come on.

647
00:58:19.855 --> 00:58:21.815
Nice work. Let's get them on the bus.

648
00:58:38.916 --> 00:58:40.167
Go, go.

649
00:58:56.852 --> 00:58:58.186
Redwood Two. Clarify status...

650
00:58:58.270 --> 00:59:00.646
<i>- Tiger One. Over.
- Almost there, sir.</i>


651
00:59:00.688 --> 00:59:03.608
<i>This is Birch One.
President is en route. Over.</i>


652
00:59:04.567 --> 00:59:07.028
Why don't you attack this Embassy?

653
00:59:09.072 --> 00:59:10.782
What are you waiting for?

654
00:59:28.009 --> 00:59:29.510
Okay. Holding.

655
00:59:32.304 --> 00:59:34.056
Better, better way.

656
00:59:42.440 --> 00:59:43.733
It's not right.

657
00:59:48.279 --> 00:59:49.405
Shit!

658
00:59:50.907 --> 00:59:52.283
What are you doing?

659
00:59:55.453 --> 00:59:56.413
Shit.

660
01:00:05.296 --> 01:00:08.967
Retreat! All back to the Embassy. Go!

661
01:00:09.050 --> 01:00:10.343
Michelle!

662
01:00:10.468 --> 01:00:11.761
Move out!

663
01:00:13.889 --> 01:00:15.849
We've been set up. 
We've been set up!

664
01:00:15.932 --> 01:00:17.267
Hey, guys! Guys!

665
01:00:31.532 --> 01:00:33.076
Get them out of here!

666
01:00:34.035 --> 01:00:35.495
Move! Go, go!

667
01:00:35.578 --> 01:00:37.663
- Sir, they knew we were coming.
- Come on.


668
01:00:51.094 --> 01:00:52.804
Let's move inside.

669
01:01:02.981 --> 01:01:04.441
Back inside.

670
01:01:04.525 --> 01:01:05.984
Go. Let's go!

671
01:01:06.819 --> 01:01:08.153
Move, move, move!

672
01:01:12.365 --> 01:01:13.867
Come on, guys, let's go.

673
01:01:20.874 --> 01:01:23.752
Get the people to the TCU
and the President to the ACR.


674
01:01:23.836 --> 01:01:25.588
- Now. Come on, move.
- Let's go.


675
01:01:30.134 --> 01:01:31.302
Where's Michelle?

676
01:01:32.720 --> 01:01:35.682
- Where's Michelle?
- She's still in the tunnel, I think.


677
01:01:36.558 --> 01:01:39.060
Keenan, don't. It's too late.
Leave it, they're gone.


678
01:01:39.144 --> 01:01:41.479
I want this Embassy combat ready
in 15 minutes.


679
01:01:41.562 --> 01:01:43.773
You're not in command anymore!

680
01:01:43.981 --> 01:01:45.983
We're talking about lives here.

681
01:01:48.861 --> 01:01:51.781
- Give me five minutes, then seal the tunnel.
- Yes, sir.


682
01:01:51.864 --> 01:01:53.199
Don't wait for me.

683
01:02:25.858 --> 01:02:27.026
Michelle.

684
01:02:34.200 --> 01:02:35.285
Sam.

685
01:02:37.912 --> 01:02:39.122
Stay down.

686
01:03:29.215 --> 01:03:30.841
I'll take you out of here.

687
01:03:59.120 --> 01:04:01.248
- Seal the tunnel.
- Yes, sir.


688
01:04:02.708 --> 01:04:03.917
Fire in the hole!

689
01:04:11.842 --> 01:04:13.344
Geller is dead.

690
01:04:13.886 --> 01:04:16.681
The Satphone's out. 
We're cut off.

691
01:04:19.892 --> 01:04:22.770
They knew we were coming. They had to.

692
01:04:28.400 --> 01:04:32.363
- Did we scan everybody?
- Everyone who passes the security post.


693
01:04:32.655 --> 01:04:34.407
But it wasn't manned.

694
01:04:38.953 --> 01:04:41.206
<i>Amirev. He's still alive, sir.</i>

695
01:04:49.882 --> 01:04:53.385
<i>This is Delta 13, we are en route.
ETA is one hour. Over.</i>


696
01:05:24.292 --> 01:05:26.086
- Mr. President.
- Sir.


697
01:05:26.586 --> 01:05:30.047
We believe the militia may have planted
a listening device on someone.


698
01:05:30.089 --> 01:05:33.342
They made sure it was someone
who made it inside.


699
01:05:34.051 --> 01:05:35.511
Check my men, please.

700
01:05:47.733 --> 01:05:48.942
Clean.

701
01:05:48.984 --> 01:05:50.068
Sir, is there any chance...

702
01:05:50.152 --> 01:05:52.780
that someone in your office
could have planted one on you?


703
01:05:53.989 --> 01:05:55.616
Anything is possible.

704
01:05:55.658 --> 01:05:57.326
- Do you mind?
- Please.


705
01:06:12.299 --> 01:06:13.551
Nothing.

706
01:06:14.510 --> 01:06:16.137
So, that's everyone.

707
01:06:16.220 --> 01:06:18.723
No. Not everyone.

708
01:06:49.630 --> 01:06:51.924
Deactivated. It's one of ours.

709
01:06:52.925 --> 01:06:56.220
Tavarov has heard everything
within 10 feet of you.


710
01:07:15.865 --> 01:07:17.491
How's your head?

711
01:07:18.743 --> 01:07:20.370
Mild concussion.

712
01:07:22.205 --> 01:07:23.665
Sam, I...

713
01:07:26.501 --> 01:07:30.088
Sometimes, life forces you
to make a tough call, Michelle.


714
01:07:31.673 --> 01:07:33.300
But those people...

715
01:07:34.593 --> 01:07:35.677
Those poor people.

716
01:07:37.595 --> 01:07:38.680
I know.

717
01:07:39.681 --> 01:07:41.224
That's history.

718
01:07:42.475 --> 01:07:45.270
Maybe it sounds cold, but that's history.

719
01:07:46.772 --> 01:07:49.691
You have to survive
to write about it, okay?

720
01:07:51.151 --> 01:07:53.404
I'm sorry I ever doubted you.

721
01:07:59.326 --> 01:08:03.206
Michelle, they'll come at us
with everything they've got.


722
01:08:04.582 --> 01:08:06.501
I need to handle this.

723
01:08:12.756 --> 01:08:14.508
Eight marines left.

724
01:08:15.301 --> 01:08:18.554
- How's the morale holding up?
- We've got 10 motivated bad-asses, Gunny...


725
01:08:18.596 --> 01:08:22.100
just itching to bring a world of pain
to these motherfuckers.


726
01:08:22.183 --> 01:08:23.601
Copy that.

727
01:08:23.768 --> 01:08:26.938
Time to get down and dirty.
Keenan wants claymores.


728
01:08:26.980 --> 01:08:29.649
You get a staffer to pass these around.
I want metal...


729
01:08:29.774 --> 01:08:33.695
keys, coins, knives, nails and I want them
back here, full, in five minutes.


730
01:08:33.779 --> 01:08:35.030
Yes, sir.

731
01:08:39.660 --> 01:08:41.661
You were looking for me?

732
01:08:42.120 --> 01:08:45.165
Sir, I feel I should be relieved
of my command.


733
01:08:45.290 --> 01:08:48.835
Officially I don't work here, remember?

734
01:08:48.919 --> 01:08:51.129
We've got Tavarov. On four.

735
01:08:52.422 --> 01:08:56.302
You take it. As far as he and I are concerned
you're in charge here.


736
01:08:58.721 --> 01:09:00.806
<i>- Sam Keenan.
- Mr. Keenan.</i>


737
01:09:00.890 --> 01:09:04.143
You can end this with no further loss
on either side.


738
01:09:04.227 --> 01:09:06.646
Release President Amirev now...

739
01:09:06.688 --> 01:09:09.441
and your people
will leave our country unharmed.


740
01:09:09.482 --> 01:09:12.444
The marines and a shit load of tanks
are heading your way.


741
01:09:12.527 --> 01:09:13.653
<i>Over.</i>

742
01:09:13.986 --> 01:09:17.657
When they get here,
they will be dealing with a new government.


743
01:09:17.740 --> 01:09:18.783
Out.

744
01:09:20.159 --> 01:09:24.747
- Baldwin, are the civilians in the basement?
- Yes, sir.


745
01:09:28.460 --> 01:09:30.086
How are we looking?

746
01:09:31.838 --> 01:09:34.883
Bad news, sir. 
Our perimeter's full of holes.

747
01:09:35.092 --> 01:09:37.344
- And the good news?
- The good news?


748
01:09:38.429 --> 01:09:41.849
We gonna teach these mothers
a whole new meaning of pain.


749
01:09:41.932 --> 01:09:44.685
Give them hell, Gunny. 
That's an order.

750
01:09:44.769 --> 01:09:46.062
Yes, sir.

751
01:09:49.815 --> 01:09:52.025
Happy 4th of July, gentlemen.

752
01:09:52.150 --> 01:09:55.612
I suggest you make full use
of the right to bear arms.


753
01:09:56.572 --> 01:09:59.033
Got to love that Second Amendment.

754
01:10:21.848 --> 01:10:24.350
- What you doing here?
- Sightseeing.


755
01:10:25.268 --> 01:10:26.478
Michelle, go to the basement.

756
01:10:26.561 --> 01:10:29.397
I would, but Mike said he can't find
a decent camera angle down there.


757
01:10:29.439 --> 01:10:31.983
Yeah, that, and the lighting sucks.

758
01:10:32.484 --> 01:10:35.320
Intelligent, beautiful, stubborn.

759
01:10:36.572 --> 01:10:37.865
Nice mix.

760
01:10:43.370 --> 01:10:45.164
<i>Sir, should we wait?</i>

761
01:10:47.124 --> 01:10:48.709
No. Attack.

762
01:10:54.882 --> 01:10:56.675
Redwood One to Redwood Two.

763
01:10:57.676 --> 01:11:00.721
They're positioning to attack. Get ready.

764
01:11:01.555 --> 01:11:02.932
Copy that.

765
01:11:04.058 --> 01:11:07.228
At code Baker, followed by your number,
hold your fire.


766
01:11:07.478 --> 01:11:09.272
<i>We lure them into the open area...</i>

767
01:11:09.355 --> 01:11:12.400
<i>at which point I will give them
their motherfucking bonus.</i>


768
01:11:12.442 --> 01:11:15.028
<i>And we all open up
with everything we've got. Over.</i>


769
01:11:15.111 --> 01:11:16.196
Over.

770
01:11:19.074 --> 01:11:20.242
Here we go!

771
01:11:48.312 --> 01:11:50.898
Come on, hurry, hurry. This way. Quicker.

772
01:11:52.650 --> 01:11:54.360
- Go, go.
- Come on, keep moving.


773
01:11:54.444 --> 01:11:56.445
Come on, move.
Get everyone in the corner over here.


774
01:12:21.180 --> 01:12:24.058
General Borgov is on the secure channel.

775
01:13:11.481 --> 01:13:14.109
Baker Three, Baker Five, Baker Seven.

776
01:13:25.412 --> 01:13:27.665
We're getting in deep. Stand down.

777
01:14:01.074 --> 01:14:03.493
<i>Tavarov, this is General Borgov.</i>

778
01:14:03.577 --> 01:14:06.913
<i>We are nearing your position,
and I am ordering you to stand down.</i>


779
01:14:06.954 --> 01:14:08.581
The Army's back.

780
01:14:09.582 --> 01:14:11.042
Withdraw now.

781
01:14:13.128 --> 01:14:14.796
Move back, move back!

782
01:14:22.888 --> 01:14:26.308
Mr. Keenan. Your cavalry has arrived.

783
01:14:26.892 --> 01:14:28.310
<i>You are lucky.</i>

784
01:14:36.486 --> 01:14:39.071
<i>Baker Six, Baker Six. 
There is a cease-fire.</i>

785
01:14:39.154 --> 01:14:42.825
<i>Militia is falling back.
I repeat, militia is falling back.</i>


786
01:14:42.992 --> 01:14:44.368
Binoculars.

787
01:15:05.182 --> 01:15:07.976
General Borgov's regiment. They made it.

788
01:15:18.278 --> 01:15:20.697
Congratulations to your brave marines.

789
01:15:20.739 --> 01:15:24.952
At last, I can release you of this burden,
and return to the Presidential Palace.


790
01:15:48.935 --> 01:15:51.562
General Borgov is a personal contact.

791
01:15:52.480 --> 01:15:56.901
It would be a great honor, Mr. President,
if I could take his report first hand.


792
01:15:56.943 --> 01:15:58.903
- Very well.
- Thank you.


793
01:15:59.195 --> 01:16:02.032
John, I sense a
juicy photo op coming up.

794
01:16:05.369 --> 01:16:08.705
Redwood One? Tell your girlfriend
to get her cameras fired up.


795
01:16:09.164 --> 01:16:10.207
<i>Over.</i>

796
01:16:11.750 --> 01:16:13.085
Copy that.

797
01:16:48.871 --> 01:16:51.123
In the nick of time, General.

798
01:16:52.500 --> 01:16:55.795
- Good to see you again.
- Thank you for coming, sir.


799
01:16:57.005 --> 01:17:01.593
This is Birch One.
Militia forces have cut and run.


800
01:17:01.635 --> 01:17:03.553
The Government Square is secured.

801
01:17:03.637 --> 01:17:07.432
Please tell President Amirev
his people await his return.


802
01:17:07.599 --> 01:17:08.976
<i>- Out.
- Yes!</i>


803
01:17:36.671 --> 01:17:37.964
Oh, shit.

804
01:17:38.381 --> 01:17:40.884
Redwood Three. 
Return to compound.

805
01:17:41.176 --> 01:17:44.054
The Army's in on this. 
Fall back, fall back!

806
01:17:44.262 --> 01:17:45.597
Get down!

807
01:18:07.703 --> 01:18:08.871
Move.

808
01:18:22.135 --> 01:18:25.053
Get the President back into the bubble.
Now.


809
01:18:25.387 --> 01:18:26.722
Come on.

810
01:19:10.559 --> 01:19:14.146
<i>Anaconda Six to US Embassy.
Do you read me? Over.</i>


811
01:19:14.688 --> 01:19:18.818
This is Redwood One, say again.
I do not read you. Over.


812
01:19:21.279 --> 01:19:25.408
<i>Anaconda Six. Do you read me?
What's your sit-rep? Over.</i>


813
01:19:25.617 --> 01:19:29.578
We've got tanks in front of the Embassy,
pounding the crap out of us.


814
01:19:29.620 --> 01:19:31.664
<i>Copy that. Will return the favor.</i>

815
01:19:33.457 --> 01:19:35.877
<i>This is the United States Army.</i>

816
01:19:35.960 --> 01:19:39.839
<i>Stand down, lower your weapons,
or you will be fired upon.</i>


817
01:19:49.683 --> 01:19:50.726
Go.

818
01:20:03.822 --> 01:20:04.990
Here.

819
01:20:33.060 --> 01:20:34.353
I'm out.

820
01:20:34.603 --> 01:20:36.063
Get out of here!

821
01:20:36.314 --> 01:20:37.315
Sir.

822
01:21:21.694 --> 01:21:22.945
Where's Sam?

823
01:21:44.801 --> 01:21:46.636
Don't think about it.

824
01:21:47.262 --> 01:21:48.430
Do it.

825
01:22:05.740 --> 01:22:07.742
- Seal this room, soldier.
- Yes, sir.


826
01:22:07.825 --> 01:22:10.369
- Keep everybody over the other side, now.
- Okay.


827
01:22:38.440 --> 01:22:40.526
Sir, Miss Whitman's not in the TCU.

828
01:23:38.168 --> 01:23:39.294
Here!

829
01:25:18.146 --> 01:25:20.399
Private, bring that stretcher.

830
01:25:20.941 --> 01:25:22.150
Move!

831
01:25:24.986 --> 01:25:26.279
Medic!

832
01:25:34.120 --> 01:25:35.288
Come on.

833
01:25:39.042 --> 01:25:40.961
We need some help here.

834
01:25:49.845 --> 01:25:51.222
Thank you.

835
01:25:52.473 --> 01:25:54.267
Right this way, sir.

836
01:25:59.438 --> 01:26:02.274
- Marine, who's in charge here?
- He is, sir.


837
01:26:08.698 --> 01:26:11.284
Commander Keenan. 
Sit, sir, sit.

838
01:26:11.993 --> 01:26:14.245
Let's get these civilians out of here.

839
01:26:14.329 --> 01:26:17.165
- Go for it, Colonel.
- Aren't you coming with us?


840
01:26:17.874 --> 01:26:19.042
That's a no.

841
01:26:19.125 --> 01:26:20.836
- You sure?
- Yes, sir.


842
01:26:25.340 --> 01:26:27.259
I'm not going anywhere.

843
01:26:35.934 --> 01:26:37.018
Sir.
