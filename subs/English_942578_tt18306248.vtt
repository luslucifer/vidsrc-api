1
00:00:37.117 --> 00:00:38.423
Morning, Doctor Carver!

2
00:00:55.048 --> 00:00:56.310
Hey Doctor Carver!

3
00:00:56.484 --> 00:00:57.485
Ethan, hi.

4
00:00:57.659 --> 00:00:58.921
Did you hear our big news?

5
00:00:59.096 --> 00:00:59.835
No.

6
00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:01.010
We're engaged.

7
00:01:01.054 --> 00:01:02.054
You and Clair?

8
00:01:02.099 --> 00:01:04.448
Oh, wow! Congratulations.

9
00:01:04.623 --> 00:01:06.451
Well, it's all thanks to you,
Doctor Carver.


10
00:01:06.625 --> 00:01:08.453
If we hadn't participated
in your study,


11
00:01:08.626 --> 00:01:10.213
I probably would have never
discovered Clair was the one.


12
00:01:10.237 --> 00:01:12.892
I'm so happy for you.
When's the big day?


13
00:01:13.066 --> 00:01:14.652
We haven't set a date yet,
but when we do,


14
00:01:14.676 --> 00:01:15.895
we hope you can make it.

15
00:01:16.069 --> 00:01:17.244
I would be honored.

16
00:01:17.418 --> 00:01:19.203
I'm sorry, I have to run.

17
00:01:19.376 --> 00:01:22.206
I have media training, but
you and Claire are the stars.


18
00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.140
You're the first couple
in the study to get engaged.


19
00:01:24.164 --> 00:01:25.209
Oh!

20
00:01:25.383 --> 00:01:27.080
Anyway, congratulations again

21
00:01:27.254 --> 00:01:28.821
and let me know when
you pick a date.


22
00:01:28.995 --> 00:01:29.822
Will do.

23
00:01:29.995 --> 00:01:31.041
- Ok, bye.
- Bye.


24
00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:38.048
Ok Brooke, it's all very simple.

25
00:01:38.221 --> 00:01:39.919
So, I will just pretend to be
a TV reporter


26
00:01:40.093 --> 00:01:41.399
and ask you some questions.

27
00:01:41.572 --> 00:01:42.652
Does that sound ok, Brooke?

28
00:01:42.748 --> 00:01:44.837
Great. Fire away, Vince.

29
00:01:45.011 --> 00:01:48.319
Alright. So, Dr. Carver, your new
study is called The Dating Test.


30
00:01:48.493 --> 00:01:49.971
How does it work?

31
00:01:50.147 --> 00:01:51.689
Simply put, the dating test
helps you find


32
00:01:51.713 --> 00:01:53.411
your ideal person.

33
00:01:53.584 --> 00:01:55.456
The one.

34
00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:58.503
Couples go on a series of dates
wearing these watch-like devices


35
00:01:58.677 --> 00:02:01.288
that record your heart rate,
dopamine levels,


36
00:02:01.462 --> 00:02:03.856
pulse ox and several
other indicators.


37
00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:05.901
It's called the attraction
tracker.


38
00:02:06.076 --> 00:02:08.116
But how do you know that
they're your ideal match?


39
00:02:08.165 --> 00:02:09.601
Like, the one.

40
00:02:09.774 --> 00:02:11.951
Your level of attraction
to another person


41
00:02:12.125 --> 00:02:14.562
is measured on a scale
of 0 to 100.


42
00:02:14.736 --> 00:02:18.436
Meet someone who scores 95
and above, you've met the one.


43
00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:20.264
But is that all that love is?

44
00:02:20.438 --> 00:02:23.571
Just a series of chemical
reactions on a score sheet?


45
00:02:23.745 --> 00:02:26.922
Yes. These physical signals
are far more reliable


46
00:02:27.097 --> 00:02:28.576
than things like emotions.

47
00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:30.230
What about feelings?

48
00:02:30.404 --> 00:02:32.972
Feelings are like relatives
at Christmas.


49
00:02:33.146 --> 00:02:34.887
They come and go.

50
00:02:35.061 --> 00:02:37.541
But isn't that how people have
found love for, well, forever?


51
00:02:37.629 --> 00:02:39.259
Which explains why more
than half of marriages


52
00:02:39.283 --> 00:02:41.894
end in divorce.

53
00:02:42.068 --> 00:02:43.287
How sad.

54
00:02:45.158 --> 00:02:47.117
Oh, sorry. Where was I?

55
00:02:47.291 --> 00:02:50.380
So, Doctor Carver, has
this new study been tested?


56
00:02:50.555 --> 00:02:52.034
How do you know that it works?

57
00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:54.036
So far it's only been tested
on students,


58
00:02:54.211 --> 00:02:56.952
but, just this morning a student
of mine told me


59
00:02:57.127 --> 00:02:59.868
he is engaged to the person
he took the study with.


60
00:03:00.042 --> 00:03:01.914
They both scored above 95.

61
00:03:02.088 --> 00:03:03.785
Wow!

62
00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:05.676
So, Doctor Carver, you've
developed quite the reputation


63
00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:07.267
for your studies on love.

64
00:03:07.441 --> 00:03:10.052
Is the dating test
your crowning achievement?


65
00:03:10.227 --> 00:03:11.924
Oh, no. This is just
the beginning.


66
00:03:12.098 --> 00:03:15.275
There is so little research
on the science of love.


67
00:03:15.449 --> 00:03:16.842
So much to learn.

68
00:03:17.016 --> 00:03:18.296
Well, thank you Doctor Carver.

69
00:03:18.452 --> 00:03:20.367
Is there anything
you'd like to add?


70
00:03:20.541 --> 00:03:22.891
- No.
- You sure?


71
00:03:23.065 --> 00:03:27.418
Oh, and here at Pemberton
University,


72
00:03:27.592 --> 00:03:29.985
we conduct research with heart.

73
00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:31.509
Terrific, Brooke.
How did it feel?


74
00:03:31.683 --> 00:03:33.815
Great. But, I'll have to check
the tape.


75
00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:37.297
Can't trust feelings, right?

76
00:03:37.471 --> 00:03:38.666
Now I know what you're thinking.

77
00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:40.866
Where's the romance?

78
00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:42.433
Measuring neurotransmitters

79
00:03:42.606 --> 00:03:45.130
isn't exactly the stuff
of Jane Austen.


80
00:03:45.305 --> 00:03:47.264
Is that what you're really
looking for?


81
00:03:47.438 --> 00:03:50.919
Drama, heartache, corsets.

82
00:03:51.093 --> 00:03:54.880
Why rely on some abstract,
gut feeling about someone


83
00:03:55.053 --> 00:03:57.012
when you can have
quantifiable results


84
00:03:57.187 --> 00:04:00.799
that tell you if that person
is the one for you.


85
00:04:00.973 --> 00:04:03.410
The dating test takes
the guessing work out of..


86
00:04:04.977 --> 00:04:06.979
- Rebecca, hi.
- Hi, Brooke.


87
00:04:07.153 --> 00:04:08.241
Practicing for tonight?

88
00:04:08.415 --> 00:04:09.851
Yes, but it's fine.
Come in.


89
00:04:10.025 --> 00:04:11.699
- How's the speech coming?
- Great, I think.


90
00:04:11.723 --> 00:04:13.403
I'll just be giving a preview
of the study.


91
00:04:13.507 --> 00:04:15.442
Well, you don't want to be
giving away too much.


92
00:04:15.466 --> 00:04:18.337
Want to save it for the big
study's release in two weeks.


93
00:04:18.512 --> 00:04:19.861
Vince is billing it as a teaser.

94
00:04:20.034 --> 00:04:21.034
Ah, perfect.

95
00:04:21.166 --> 00:04:22.734
He told me that

96
00:04:22.907 --> 00:04:23.517
the practice interview
this morning went well.


97
00:04:23.691 --> 00:04:24.910
Mm-hm.

98
00:04:25.084 --> 00:04:26.955
Never thought one
of my professors


99
00:04:27.129 --> 00:04:29.915
would get more TV time than
the university's president.


100
00:04:30.089 --> 00:04:31.873
Rebecca, I am not...

101
00:04:32.047 --> 00:04:33.919
Oh, Brooke, I'm not complaining.

102
00:04:34.093 --> 00:04:36.922
Your research has put
this school on the map.


103
00:04:37.096 --> 00:04:41.143
We plan on taking full advantage
of our newfound notoriety.


104
00:04:41.318 --> 00:04:42.971
Have you heard the new
branding slogan?


105
00:04:43.145 --> 00:04:44.451
Research with heart.

106
00:04:44.625 --> 00:04:46.323
Kind of humanizes it,
don't you think?


107
00:04:46.497 --> 00:04:47.933
Mm-hm.

108
00:04:48.107 --> 00:04:49.935
I mean, it's not just about
the data, right?


109
00:04:50.109 --> 00:04:51.980
- Uh.
- Oh, Brooke.


110
00:04:52.154 --> 00:04:54.592
We are gonna ride
your coattails.


111
00:04:54.766 --> 00:04:58.465
We intend to increase
enrollment, funding,


112
00:04:58.639 --> 00:05:00.989
maybe even bump up our ranking.

113
00:05:01.163 --> 00:05:03.775
Oh, I don't know if my study
can do all that.


114
00:05:03.949 --> 00:05:07.996
Brooke, don't be modest,
my star professor.


115
00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:10.085
Or should I say Dean?

116
00:05:11.609 --> 00:05:12.914
Dean?

117
00:05:13.088 --> 00:05:15.221
Had a meeting with the Board.

118
00:05:15.395 --> 00:05:20.922
We think you'd be a perfect
new Dean of Psychology.


119
00:05:21.096 --> 00:05:24.012
But, let's revisit it
after the launch.


120
00:05:24.186 --> 00:05:25.884
Yes. Of course.

121
00:05:26.058 --> 00:05:28.138
And good luck tonight,
I'll see you at the theater.


122
00:05:28.234 --> 00:05:29.235
Thanks, Rebecca.

123
00:05:29.409 --> 00:05:32.238
Oh, and no pressure, right?

124
00:05:40.028 --> 00:05:42.988
She's expecting a boost in
donations, enrollment, ranking.


125
00:05:43.162 --> 00:05:43.902
All from your study?

126
00:05:44.076 --> 00:05:45.730
I know.

127
00:05:45.904 --> 00:05:47.403
Hm. Doctor Frankenstein,
you've created a monster.


128
00:05:47.427 --> 00:05:48.863
But wait, there's more.

129
00:05:49.037 --> 00:05:51.605
She's thinking of naming me
department Dean.


130
00:05:51.779 --> 00:05:55.305
Huh. That'd be kind of weird,
having you as my boss.


131
00:05:55.479 --> 00:05:57.829
Wait, will you give me tenure?

132
00:05:58.003 --> 00:06:00.092
Stop. I'm happy where I am.

133
00:06:00.266 --> 00:06:01.746
Come on, psychology Dean?

134
00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:04.009
More coin, prestige,
swanky receptions


135
00:06:04.183 --> 00:06:05.663
with that smelly cheese.

136
00:06:05.837 --> 00:06:08.840
And less time for research,
my first love.


137
00:06:09.014 --> 00:06:12.974
Speaking of first love, how's
it been since your last love?


138
00:06:13.148 --> 00:06:14.236
You mean Logan?

139
00:06:14.411 --> 00:06:15.431
I thought it was Landon.

140
00:06:15.455 --> 00:06:16.848
Landon was before Logan.

141
00:06:17.022 --> 00:06:18.565
Which makes your next
boyfriend Lucas?


142
00:06:18.589 --> 00:06:20.112
Which makes my next boyfriend
no one.


143
00:06:20.286 --> 00:06:21.635
I'm done.

144
00:06:21.809 --> 00:06:23.376
With guys whose names
start with I?


145
00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:24.919
With guys period.
With dating, swiping right.


146
00:06:24.943 --> 00:06:26.597
Oh, don't be a drama queen.

147
00:06:26.771 --> 00:06:28.947
Carly, I am not having
my heart stomped on again.


148
00:06:29.121 --> 00:06:30.862
But you're the expert on love.

149
00:06:31.036 --> 00:06:33.386
Yes, with the science of love,
why the heart races,


150
00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:35.780
the pupils dilate.
The palms sweat.


151
00:06:35.954 --> 00:06:37.390
I thought that was
a panic attack?


152
00:06:37.564 --> 00:06:39.004
It's why I developed
the love test.


153
00:06:39.174 --> 00:06:41.916
I want people looking for love
to find it.


154
00:06:42.090 --> 00:06:43.657
Ok, but what if you meet a guy

155
00:06:43.831 --> 00:06:46.834
who scores like a 98 on
the attraction tracker?


156
00:06:47.008 --> 00:06:49.054
George Clooney's looks
with Einstein's smarts?


157
00:06:49.228 --> 00:06:53.363
Unlikely. Anyway, I don't need
men to get my dopamine fix.


158
00:06:53.537 --> 00:06:54.842
I have chocolate for that.

159
00:06:55.016 --> 00:06:56.366
Oh, no. Thanks.

160
00:06:56.540 --> 00:06:58.977
I hope to get my dopamine
boost tonight.


161
00:06:59.151 --> 00:07:00.282
I have a date. And...

162
00:07:00.457 --> 00:07:01.936
You're doing the test with him?

163
00:07:02.110 --> 00:07:03.808
Not the whole thing,
just some questions


164
00:07:03.982 --> 00:07:06.071
to see if he, you know,
measures up.


165
00:07:06.245 --> 00:07:07.725
Good luck.

166
00:07:07.899 --> 00:07:09.267
But, if the chocolate offer
still stands?


167
00:07:09.291 --> 00:07:10.510
You know, for later.

168
00:07:10.684 --> 00:07:12.512
In case my date's
a dopamine dud.


169
00:07:19.954 --> 00:07:22.348
Hey, Molly. Are you
in pain today?


170
00:07:22.522 --> 00:07:27.788
How's that leg doing, huh?
Still a little tender, huh?


171
00:07:27.962 --> 00:07:29.355
Aw.

172
00:07:29.529 --> 00:07:31.009
How's Molly doing,
Doctor Bennett?


173
00:07:31.183 --> 00:07:33.272
Good. Yeah, she'll be ready
for walks soon.


174
00:07:33.446 --> 00:07:34.926
When will she be ready
for adoption?


175
00:07:35.013 --> 00:07:36.928
Oh, I'd say a week, maybe two.

176
00:07:37.102 --> 00:07:40.234
Oh, look at that face.
She'll be adopted in no time.


177
00:07:40.410 --> 00:07:42.370
And to think when I started
we only had five dogs.


178
00:07:43.717 --> 00:07:45.937
Oh, I'm sorry, Max.
Six dogs.


179
00:07:46.111 --> 00:07:48.635
Max, you don't count,
you're not up for adoption.


180
00:07:50.724 --> 00:07:52.291
You mind taking her back
to the kennels,


181
00:07:52.465 --> 00:07:53.901
make sure she's comfortable?

182
00:07:54.075 --> 00:07:55.618
Sure, Doctor Bennett, yeah,
anything else?


183
00:07:55.642 --> 00:07:57.949
- Yeah, your advice.
- My advice?


184
00:07:58.123 --> 00:08:01.779
Yeah, I'm going to a talk at
the university with Taylor later


185
00:08:01.953 --> 00:08:04.869
and uh, things have been
a little rocky lately.


186
00:08:05.043 --> 00:08:07.349
Flowers. Every woman
loves flowers.


187
00:08:07.524 --> 00:08:08.786
Old school. I like that.

188
00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:11.310
Maybe sunflowers?
Bright, cheerful.


189
00:08:11.484 --> 00:08:12.920
They bring good luck.

190
00:08:13.094 --> 00:08:15.532
In that case, maybe
I'll get a couple dozen.


191
00:08:15.706 --> 00:08:17.229
Good girl.

192
00:08:52.394 --> 00:08:53.395
Ugh!

193
00:08:57.617 --> 00:09:01.360
Oh yeah. Perfect.

194
00:09:10.238 --> 00:09:11.283
Beautiful.

195
00:09:11.457 --> 00:09:13.024
Thanks. Way to a woman's heart.

196
00:09:13.198 --> 00:09:14.286
And her brain.

197
00:09:14.460 --> 00:09:15.983
Sorry?

198
00:09:16.157 --> 00:09:18.037
Oh, it's just, when a person
receives flowers,


199
00:09:18.159 --> 00:09:19.485
it's actually their brain
that produces


200
00:09:19.509 --> 00:09:21.119
the pleasurable feelings.

201
00:09:21.293 --> 00:09:23.034
Hm. That takes the romance
out of it.


202
00:09:23.208 --> 00:09:25.471
Oh, romantic feelings
don't really...


203
00:09:25.645 --> 00:09:28.996
Sorry, don't mean to get
all science channel on you.


204
00:09:29.170 --> 00:09:31.303
Kind of a buzz kill.

205
00:09:31.477 --> 00:09:34.262
My favorite customer.
How're you doing?


206
00:09:34.436 --> 00:09:37.352
Happy as a sunflower
on a sunny day.


207
00:09:37.527 --> 00:09:40.051
- Speaking of which?
- Oh, your flowers.


208
00:09:40.225 --> 00:09:43.141
Oh, this nice young man
is holding them for you.


209
00:09:43.315 --> 00:09:45.056
Oh, uh, actually.

210
00:09:45.230 --> 00:09:47.798
There you go, Brooke,
all paid for.


211
00:09:47.972 --> 00:09:49.277
Oh, thank you, Liz.

212
00:09:49.451 --> 00:09:50.811
Mm-hm. You got
the final bouquet.


213
00:09:51.323 --> 00:09:52.846
I saved the best for last.

214
00:09:53.020 --> 00:09:55.414
Ah, you are the best!
They're so beautiful.


215
00:09:55.588 --> 00:09:58.939
That they are. Well, see you
next month, Brooke.


216
00:09:59.113 --> 00:09:59.853
Bye.

217
00:10:00.027 --> 00:10:01.681
Yeah. Bye.

218
00:10:01.855 --> 00:10:04.858
Ah, hey, oh, excuse me.
Hey, um, those are my flowers.


219
00:10:05.032 --> 00:10:06.904
Oh, I'm sorry, but they're
actually mine.


220
00:10:07.078 --> 00:10:09.036
You saw me, I was holding them.

221
00:10:09.210 --> 00:10:11.430
I know, but they're still mine.

222
00:10:11.604 --> 00:10:13.911
Do they have your name
on them or something?


223
00:10:14.085 --> 00:10:16.304
Actually, I do a standing order.

224
00:10:16.478 --> 00:10:19.220
Ah. Oh.

225
00:10:19.394 --> 00:10:22.528
Uh, what about lavender?
Makes a great aromatherapy.


226
00:10:22.702 --> 00:10:23.529
Very calming.

227
00:10:23.703 --> 00:10:24.878
Hm. You don't say.

228
00:10:25.052 --> 00:10:26.184
Cures insomnia.

229
00:10:26.358 --> 00:10:27.402
Oh, I sleep like a baby.

230
00:10:27.577 --> 00:10:28.839
- Hair loss?
- I'm good.


231
00:10:29.013 --> 00:10:30.057
Stress?

232
00:10:30.231 --> 00:10:31.382
Getting worse by the moment.

233
00:10:31.406 --> 00:10:32.886
Look, I'm sorry, I just...

234
00:10:33.060 --> 00:10:34.409
What if we go halfsies?

235
00:10:34.584 --> 00:10:35.367
Halfsies?

236
00:10:35.541 --> 00:10:37.108
Split em 50-50.

237
00:10:37.282 --> 00:10:39.632
Um, if not lavender,
then what about...


238
00:10:39.806 --> 00:10:43.636
You don't understand. I
need all the luck I can get.


239
00:10:43.810 --> 00:10:46.030
You're right, I
don't understand.


240
00:10:46.204 --> 00:10:47.945
Anyway, good luck.

241
00:10:48.119 --> 00:10:51.339
60-40? 70-30?

242
00:10:51.513 --> 00:10:53.037
Final offer.

243
00:11:13.057 --> 00:11:14.928
Flower thief, we meet again.

244
00:11:15.102 --> 00:11:16.974
Ryan. Hi.

245
00:11:17.148 --> 00:11:18.540
Taylor, hey.

246
00:11:18.715 --> 00:11:19.933
Are Sophie and Kyle here?

247
00:11:20.107 --> 00:11:21.195
Not yet.

248
00:11:22.632 --> 00:11:23.807
What's this?

249
00:11:23.981 --> 00:11:25.219
Lavender. It promotes healing.

250
00:11:25.243 --> 00:11:27.027
It may just promote sleepiness.

251
00:11:27.201 --> 00:11:28.701
Hey, you want to see something
really beautiful?


252
00:11:28.725 --> 00:11:29.987
Oh, it also cures hair loss.

253
00:11:30.161 --> 00:11:31.989
My new clothing line's out.

254
00:11:32.163 --> 00:11:34.034
This is the collection
I was talking about,


255
00:11:34.208 --> 00:11:37.821
where elegant, modern
and comfort blend into one.


256
00:11:37.995 --> 00:11:40.301
Huh. Nice.

257
00:11:40.475 --> 00:11:41.955
Nice?

258
00:11:42.129 --> 00:11:43.870
Ryan, these are $1500 outfits.

259
00:11:44.044 --> 00:11:47.091
People actually pay that?

260
00:11:47.265 --> 00:11:49.963
Yes. People with money.

261
00:11:50.137 --> 00:11:51.922
Something you had when you
worked with Kyle.


262
00:11:52.096 --> 00:11:53.488
Taylor, let's, let's...

263
00:11:53.663 --> 00:11:56.927
Hey! Sorry we're late.
Nice flowers.


264
00:11:57.101 --> 00:11:58.101
Don't get me started.

265
00:11:58.232 --> 00:11:59.538
I am so excited for this.

266
00:11:59.712 --> 00:12:00.321
Me too.

267
00:12:00.495 --> 00:12:01.888
Me three.

268
00:12:02.062 --> 00:12:04.108
Yeah me, who, who is
this woman again?


269
00:12:04.282 --> 00:12:05.642
I told you Ryan,
it's a professor


270
00:12:05.675 --> 00:12:07.035
who does all these
studies on love.


271
00:12:07.198 --> 00:12:09.026
She developed this
wearable biosensor


272
00:12:09.200 --> 00:12:10.960
and it monitors your body's
attraction to another person.


273
00:12:10.984 --> 00:12:12.377
What?

274
00:12:12.551 --> 00:12:13.571
It gives you like
an attraction score.


275
00:12:13.595 --> 00:12:14.379
I think she calls it a...

276
00:12:14.553 --> 00:12:16.381
Attraction tracker.

277
00:12:16.555 --> 00:12:17.575
After three dates, you know
if you met your perfect match.


278
00:12:17.599 --> 00:12:18.949
Isn't that incredible?

279
00:12:19.123 --> 00:12:20.690
Incredible and totally
ridiculous.


280
00:12:20.864 --> 00:12:21.647
Well, apparently her study's
being published


281
00:12:21.821 --> 00:12:23.127
in a psychology journal.

282
00:12:23.301 --> 00:12:24.868
More likely "Ladies
Home Journal".


283
00:12:25.042 --> 00:12:26.402
Is everything a joke
to you Ryan?


284
00:12:26.478 --> 00:12:28.959
No, it's just, it's not
how it works.


285
00:12:29.133 --> 00:12:30.525
Love is a feeling.

286
00:12:30.700 --> 00:12:32.310
It's like a giant fireball
hitting you.


287
00:12:32.484 --> 00:12:34.225
- A fireball?
- Yeah.


288
00:12:34.399 --> 00:12:36.183
- Like love at first sight?
- Exactly.


289
00:12:36.357 --> 00:12:38.397
It just, you know, doesn't
happen on the first date,


290
00:12:38.490 --> 00:12:40.927
forget about it.

291
00:12:41.101 --> 00:12:44.148
- Ready to go in?
- Yeah, I'm right behind you.


292
00:12:45.671 --> 00:12:48.021
- Forget about it.
- After you.


293
00:12:51.590 --> 00:12:52.765
Flowers?

294
00:12:54.245 --> 00:12:57.770
This is all your fault.
This is all your fault!


295
00:13:03.994 --> 00:13:05.473
Ready?

296
00:13:05.647 --> 00:13:07.258
Ready as I'll ever be.

297
00:13:07.432 --> 00:13:10.043
FYI, we're recording this.

298
00:13:10.217 --> 00:13:12.437
We'll use clips for
the study's release.


299
00:13:12.611 --> 00:13:16.615
Great. Good luck...
Dean Carver.


300
00:13:19.487 --> 00:13:21.402
Dean Carver.

301
00:13:22.577 --> 00:13:24.536
It does kind of have
a ring to it.


302
00:13:26.364 --> 00:13:29.062
And so the big question
everyone wants to know,


303
00:13:29.236 --> 00:13:33.197
can the dating test really
help you find the one.


304
00:13:33.371 --> 00:13:36.026
Can these physical indicators
really tell you


305
00:13:36.200 --> 00:13:39.551
if someone is your
one true love?


306
00:13:39.725 --> 00:13:44.382
All in less than a week?
And the answer is... yes.


307
00:13:44.556 --> 00:13:45.818
It works.

308
00:13:47.733 --> 00:13:51.041
Eight out of ten people
who scored 95 or above


309
00:13:51.215 --> 00:13:54.609
were identified as their
partner's ideal match.


310
00:13:54.784 --> 00:13:57.961
So, now I have a question
for you.


311
00:13:58.135 --> 00:13:59.876
What are you waiting for?

312
00:14:00.050 --> 00:14:03.227
Why wait for the mythical
arrow to strike


313
00:14:03.401 --> 00:14:09.407
when you can do something
to find the love of your life.


314
00:14:18.198 --> 00:14:20.505
Two weeks from today I will be
back on this stage


315
00:14:20.679 --> 00:14:23.421
to announce the
official release.


316
00:14:23.595 --> 00:14:26.380
I'd be happy to take
a few questions.


317
00:14:26.554 --> 00:14:27.947
Yes, you.

318
00:14:30.123 --> 00:14:32.299
Oh. It's the man from
the flower shop.


319
00:14:32.473 --> 00:14:33.997
How're my sunflowers doing?

320
00:14:34.171 --> 00:14:36.260
My sunflowers are alive
and well, thank you.


321
00:14:36.434 --> 00:14:38.218
Do you have a question?

322
00:14:38.392 --> 00:14:41.439
Yeah, I was wondering if you've
taken this dating test yourself?


323
00:14:41.613 --> 00:14:43.133
Researchers don't
usually participate


324
00:14:43.180 --> 00:14:44.268
in their own studies.

325
00:14:44.442 --> 00:14:45.442
So the answer is no?

326
00:14:45.486 --> 00:14:47.271
Ryan, stop.

327
00:14:47.445 --> 00:14:49.726
Well, yes. I mean no, I never
participated in the study.


328
00:14:49.795 --> 00:14:51.928
Well, with all due respect,
Doctor,


329
00:14:52.102 --> 00:14:53.427
you're telling others
to try something


330
00:14:53.451 --> 00:14:54.844
you're not willing
to try yourself.


331
00:14:55.018 --> 00:14:57.237
- Ryan. Sit down.
- What?


332
00:14:57.411 --> 00:14:59.849
People can decide
for themselves.


333
00:15:00.023 --> 00:15:01.807
Vince, tell her to move
onto somebody else.


334
00:15:01.981 --> 00:15:03.916
Brooke, Rebecca wants you
to take another question.


335
00:15:03.940 --> 00:15:05.115
Another question.

336
00:15:07.291 --> 00:15:08.945
Hey.

337
00:15:15.299 --> 00:15:16.778
Taylor. Taylor, wait!

338
00:15:16.953 --> 00:15:18.693
That was so embarrassing.

339
00:15:18.868 --> 00:15:20.410
You're never interested in
anything that I care about.


340
00:15:20.434 --> 00:15:22.151
Ever since you left
your practice with Kyle,


341
00:15:22.175 --> 00:15:23.413
all you care about is
your dog rescue center.


342
00:15:23.437 --> 00:15:25.004
I care about you.

343
00:15:25.178 --> 00:15:26.978
Face it, Ryan, it's...
it's not working out.


344
00:15:27.050 --> 00:15:30.488
Taylor, come on.
What, Taylor?


345
00:15:30.662 --> 00:15:31.358
Please!

346
00:15:31.532 --> 00:15:33.143
What...

347
00:15:38.539 --> 00:15:39.539
Thank you.

348
00:15:42.152 --> 00:15:43.457
Sorry about that, Brooke.

349
00:15:43.631 --> 00:15:44.695
I didn't like where
it was going.


350
00:15:44.719 --> 00:15:46.417
I can handle that guy.

351
00:15:46.591 --> 00:15:49.028
I know. I just wanted it over.
We can edit the video.


352
00:15:49.202 --> 00:15:52.336
Fantastic presentation.
Congratulations.


353
00:15:52.510 --> 00:15:53.815
Thank you.

354
00:15:53.990 --> 00:15:55.510
Maybe we'll skip
the Q & A next time.


355
00:15:57.776 --> 00:15:59.125
Do you have a question?

356
00:15:59.299 --> 00:16:00.899
Yeah, I was wondering
if you have taken


357
00:16:00.997 --> 00:16:02.912
the dating test yourself?

358
00:16:03.086 --> 00:16:04.150
Researchers don't usually
participate


359
00:16:04.174 --> 00:16:05.349
in their own studies.

360
00:16:05.523 --> 00:16:06.828
So the answer is no?

361
00:16:07.003 --> 00:16:08.526
Well, yes, I mean no.

362
00:16:08.700 --> 00:16:10.876
I never participated
in the study.


363
00:16:11.050 --> 00:16:12.660
With all due respect-

364
00:16:12.834 --> 00:16:14.073
- Don't worry, we're deleting
all that from the video.


365
00:16:14.097 --> 00:16:15.620
That bad?

366
00:16:15.794 --> 00:16:17.511
We just can't afford
any hiccups right now.


367
00:16:17.535 --> 00:16:19.165
There's too much riding
on the study's release.


368
00:16:19.189 --> 00:16:21.539
Sorry to interrupt,
but we have an issue.


369
00:16:21.713 --> 00:16:23.038
Researchers don't
usually participate


370
00:16:23.062 --> 00:16:24.062
in their own studies.

371
00:16:24.194 --> 00:16:25.978
So the answer is no?

372
00:16:26.152 --> 00:16:28.433
Well, yes. I mean no, I never
participated in the study.


373
00:16:28.502 --> 00:16:29.329
Hm, well...

374
00:16:29.503 --> 00:16:30.940
Vince, we all saw that.

375
00:16:31.114 --> 00:16:34.813
Yeah, and so have

376
00:16:34.987 --> 00:16:36.858
I'm afraid someone recorded it
on their phone.


377
00:16:37.033 --> 00:16:38.382
Oh no.

378
00:16:38.556 --> 00:16:40.099
It's getting a thousand hits
a minute.


379
00:16:40.123 --> 00:16:41.559
Almost half a million likes.

380
00:16:41.733 --> 00:16:44.388
They're referring to Brooke
as Doctor Cupid.


381
00:16:44.562 --> 00:16:47.782
The study's credibility.
Brooke's reputation.


382
00:16:47.957 --> 00:16:48.958
The school's reputation.

383
00:16:49.132 --> 00:16:50.437
The new branding campaign.

384
00:16:50.611 --> 00:16:53.223
Fundraising. Enrollment.
Our ranking.


385
00:16:53.397 --> 00:16:54.397
This is a disaster.

386
00:16:54.485 --> 00:16:55.573
It is.

387
00:16:57.227 --> 00:16:58.750
Unless, uh...

388
00:17:00.404 --> 00:17:02.406
Yes, of course,
I'll take the study.


389
00:17:02.580 --> 00:17:04.016
That's it.

390
00:17:04.190 --> 00:17:05.017
I'll find a single professor
on campus,


391
00:17:05.191 --> 00:17:06.713
we'll finish in a week

392
00:17:06.888 --> 00:17:08.343
and still have a week to prepare
for the launch.


393
00:17:08.367 --> 00:17:10.066
But what about if you find,
you know?


394
00:17:10.240 --> 00:17:12.024
What, find my perfect match?

395
00:17:12.198 --> 00:17:14.418
Vince, have you seen
the eligible bachelors


396
00:17:14.592 --> 00:17:15.809
on this campus?

397
00:17:15.985 --> 00:17:19.075
Alright. They're not all bad.

398
00:17:19.249 --> 00:17:20.902
Problem solved.

399
00:17:21.077 --> 00:17:22.077
Perfect!

400
00:17:26.691 --> 00:17:28.060
Eventually we'll bump out
this back wall


401
00:17:28.084 --> 00:17:29.824
and make room for more kennels.

402
00:17:29.999 --> 00:17:32.280
I gotta hand it to you, buddy,
this place looks amazing.


403
00:17:32.436 --> 00:17:35.439
Yeah, thanks.
Oh, check this out.


404
00:17:35.613 --> 00:17:37.049
What's this?

405
00:17:37.223 --> 00:17:39.791
This is a plan for the space
next door.


406
00:17:39.965 --> 00:17:41.662
Wow! You've thought
about everything.


407
00:17:41.836 --> 00:17:44.032
A little artificial grass,
room for the dogs to run around.


408
00:17:44.056 --> 00:17:45.318
I love it.

409
00:17:45.492 --> 00:17:46.892
I guess this means
you're definitely


410
00:17:46.928 --> 00:17:47.949
not coming back to the practice

411
00:17:47.973 --> 00:17:49.366
No chance.

412
00:17:49.540 --> 00:17:50.691
Another stake through
Taylor's heart.


413
00:17:50.715 --> 00:17:52.369
Tell me about it.

414
00:17:52.543 --> 00:17:53.326
You heard from her?

415
00:17:53.500 --> 00:17:54.501
Nope.

416
00:17:54.675 --> 00:17:56.460
No, no, she's pretty upset.

417
00:17:56.634 --> 00:17:59.985
She says that I'm not interested
in things that interest her.


418
00:18:00.159 --> 00:18:00.942
Like the dating test.

419
00:18:01.117 --> 00:18:02.466
That's one.

420
00:18:05.686 --> 00:18:07.079
You're not gonna believe this.

421
00:18:07.253 --> 00:18:09.516
Some PR guy from that university
called me,


422
00:18:09.690 --> 00:18:13.346
he said he wants me to take the
dating test with that professor.


423
00:18:13.520 --> 00:18:14.869
No kidding. What did you say?

424
00:18:15.044 --> 00:18:16.697
I said no, of course,

425
00:18:16.871 --> 00:18:18.831
I mean he hadn't even run it by
the professor yet.


426
00:18:19.004 --> 00:18:20.286
Well, what if she agreed
to do it?


427
00:18:20.310 --> 00:18:22.225
I would still say no.

428
00:18:22.399 --> 00:18:24.227
Although he did offer me
a stipend.


429
00:18:24.401 --> 00:18:25.967
Really? How much?

430
00:18:26.142 --> 00:18:27.142
A lot.

431
00:18:27.273 --> 00:18:29.145
I think you should do it.

432
00:18:29.319 --> 00:18:30.755
It's like a week.

433
00:18:30.929 --> 00:18:32.385
It's, that's a week
I'll never get back.


434
00:18:32.409 --> 00:18:34.541
But maybe you'd get Taylor back.

435
00:18:34.715 --> 00:18:36.935
Well, how-what are you
talking about?


436
00:18:37.109 --> 00:18:40.330
Look, Taylor wants you to take
this test thing seriously, right?


437
00:18:40.504 --> 00:18:42.941
- Yeah.
- Ok, so, stay with me here.


438
00:18:43.115 --> 00:18:44.986
You take the dating test
with the professor


439
00:18:45.161 --> 00:18:48.207
to convince Taylor that
you're taking it seriously,


440
00:18:48.381 --> 00:18:51.819
and then I get a cut
of your stipend.


441
00:18:51.993 --> 00:18:54.518
Huh. I mean, it would pay
for a lot of artificial grass.


442
00:18:54.692 --> 00:18:56.172
That too.

443
00:18:57.129 --> 00:18:58.957
- Alright, let's do it.
- Yes.


444
00:18:59.131 --> 00:19:01.177
- How do we tell Taylor?
- Ah.


445
00:19:01.351 --> 00:19:03.048
Oh, you can bet,
if I tell Sophie...


446
00:19:03.222 --> 00:19:04.504
Oh yeah, she's gonna
tell Taylor.


447
00:19:04.528 --> 00:19:07.357
Exactly. What about
a plan B?


448
00:19:07.531 --> 00:19:09.185
For what? How to tell Taylor?

449
00:19:09.359 --> 00:19:11.361
No, what if the dating
test works


450
00:19:11.535 --> 00:19:13.363
and you fall madly in love
with her?


451
00:19:13.537 --> 00:19:16.057
Ah, I would have felt something
on the first time that we met.


452
00:19:16.192 --> 00:19:17.018
No giant fireball?

453
00:19:17.193 --> 00:19:18.629
Not even a flicker.

454
00:19:18.803 --> 00:19:19.867
Then we've got nothing
to worry about.


455
00:19:19.891 --> 00:19:21.110
Ok.

456
00:19:24.069 --> 00:19:26.071
Let me see if I understand
correctly.


457
00:19:26.245 --> 00:19:28.943
You want me to date you
for a week?


458
00:19:29.118 --> 00:19:31.511
That's right, Doctor Matthews.
We'll finish in a week.


459
00:19:31.685 --> 00:19:33.470
Ok.

460
00:19:33.644 --> 00:19:35.404
Oh, great, great, any chance
you can start tomorrow?


461
00:19:35.428 --> 00:19:37.387
I need to check with my wife.

462
00:19:37.561 --> 00:19:39.084
You need to ask your wife.

463
00:19:39.258 --> 00:19:41.434
Yeah. Um, never mind.
I thought...


464
00:19:41.608 --> 00:19:43.020
Hey honey, there's a professor
on the phone.


465
00:19:43.044 --> 00:19:45.046
Okay, bye.

466
00:19:45.221 --> 00:19:47.788
Good news. The search is over.

467
00:19:47.962 --> 00:19:50.791
Vince has found you the perfect
man to take the test with.


468
00:19:50.965 --> 00:19:51.965
He's a doctor.

469
00:19:52.097 --> 00:19:53.838
Really?

470
00:19:54.012 --> 00:19:55.294
'Cause I think I've asked almost
every professor on campus.


471
00:19:55.318 --> 00:19:57.276
Hello again.

472
00:19:57.450 --> 00:20:01.454
Uh, Brooke, meet
Doctor Ryan Bennett.


473
00:20:01.628 --> 00:20:04.065
You're joking.

474
00:20:04.240 --> 00:20:05.806
Doctor Bennett has...

475
00:20:05.980 --> 00:20:07.808
Ryan, please.

476
00:20:07.982 --> 00:20:12.161
Uh, Ryan has graciously agreed
to take the test with you.


477
00:20:12.335 --> 00:20:13.858
You're not joking.

478
00:20:14.032 --> 00:20:15.227
Brooke, we think this is
exactly what's needed


479
00:20:15.251 --> 00:20:16.817
to get ahead of the viral video.

480
00:20:16.991 --> 00:20:20.473
- But him?
- Yes, me.


481
00:20:20.647 --> 00:20:22.475
The guy from the flower shop.

482
00:20:22.649 --> 00:20:24.347
Oh, sorry, I thought
you were the guy


483
00:20:24.521 --> 00:20:26.087
who was asking snarky questions.

484
00:20:26.262 --> 00:20:27.263
Snarky?

485
00:20:27.437 --> 00:20:28.960
Would you prefer rude?

486
00:20:29.134 --> 00:20:30.527
I prefer informed.

487
00:20:30.701 --> 00:20:32.268
Are you even a real doctor?

488
00:20:32.442 --> 00:20:34.042
Look who's asking snarky
questions now.


489
00:20:34.095 --> 00:20:36.837
I prefer informed.

490
00:20:37.011 --> 00:20:39.840
If the dating test can get
these two to fall in love,


491
00:20:40.014 --> 00:20:41.973
it can get anyone
to fall in love.


492
00:20:42.147 --> 00:20:44.715
So, are you gonna ask me
my astrological sign?


493
00:20:48.022 --> 00:20:50.416
Oh, he's cute.

494
00:20:50.590 --> 00:20:53.114
Who, that guy or the dog?

495
00:20:53.289 --> 00:20:54.725
Oh, come on, Brooke.

496
00:20:54.899 --> 00:20:57.206
A cute guy who runs
Jolly Rovers Rescue?


497
00:20:57.380 --> 00:20:59.164
He can't be all bad.

498
00:20:59.338 --> 00:21:00.644
No?

499
00:21:00.818 --> 00:21:02.994
I can grin and bear it
for a week.


500
00:21:03.168 --> 00:21:04.608
And your first date's
this evening?


501
00:21:04.648 --> 00:21:06.040
"Date."

502
00:21:08.042 --> 00:21:09.914
Wow, who's that?

503
00:21:10.088 --> 00:21:11.488
He didn't say he had
a girlfriend.


504
00:21:11.611 --> 00:21:13.918
Probably who the flowers
are for.


505
00:21:14.092 --> 00:21:15.485
Doesn't matter.
It's all for show.


506
00:21:15.659 --> 00:21:17.158
Brooke, you saw him
in the flower shop


507
00:21:17.182 --> 00:21:19.532
just before your speech.
It's fate.


508
00:21:19.706 --> 00:21:21.621
More like a fluke.

509
00:21:21.795 --> 00:21:25.190
Anyway, a week from now I can
say I did the test and move on.


510
00:21:25.364 --> 00:21:27.932
Unless he turns out to be
your perfect match.


511
00:21:28.106 --> 00:21:30.978
That guy? More like the dog.

512
00:21:33.372 --> 00:21:38.899
Ok. Born and raised
in Muncie, Indiana.


513
00:21:39.073 --> 00:21:41.511
University of Chicago, Columbia.

514
00:21:41.685 --> 00:21:45.863
PhD in social psychology.

515
00:21:46.037 --> 00:21:48.518
Pioneering in studies
on the science of love.


516
00:21:48.692 --> 00:21:50.650
More like pseudoscience.

517
00:21:52.696 --> 00:21:54.132
Hm.

518
00:21:54.306 --> 00:21:56.134
Wish my college professors
looked like that.


519
00:22:01.095 --> 00:22:03.141
What do we have in here?

520
00:22:04.185 --> 00:22:05.883
Ok, it's ready.

521
00:22:06.057 --> 00:22:10.235
Neurological studies of
interpersonal closeness.


522
00:22:10.409 --> 00:22:11.845
My dissertation.

523
00:22:12.019 --> 00:22:13.499
Oh, romantic.

524
00:22:13.673 --> 00:22:15.849
So, I did a spreadsheet to...

525
00:22:16.023 --> 00:22:18.983
Wait, wait, wait.
We have spreadsheets?


526
00:22:19.157 --> 00:22:22.813
Yes, to plot out the times,
places and objectives


527
00:22:22.987 --> 00:22:24.858
of our dates this week.

528
00:22:25.032 --> 00:22:26.686
Our dates have objectives?

529
00:22:26.860 --> 00:22:28.403
Yes, didn't you read the
background info I sent you?


530
00:22:28.427 --> 00:22:30.951
Uh, yep.
Yeah, I skimmed.


531
00:22:31.125 --> 00:22:32.562
Which is why I brought you this.

532
00:22:32.736 --> 00:22:34.453
Wow. Well, I hope this is
a take home test.


533
00:22:34.477 --> 00:22:36.585
It includes the complete study,
a list of questions,


534
00:22:36.609 --> 00:22:38.524
types of dates and appendices.

535
00:22:38.698 --> 00:22:40.134
You'll need this.

536
00:22:40.309 --> 00:22:41.590
Oh, Doctor Carver,
you shouldn't have.


537
00:22:41.614 --> 00:22:43.877
I didn't get you anything.

538
00:22:44.051 --> 00:22:46.924
The biosensor monitors
your heart rate, pulse ox,


539
00:22:47.098 --> 00:22:48.404
and a bunch of other things.

540
00:22:48.578 --> 00:22:50.101
Hm. And who monitors
the monitor?


541
00:22:50.275 --> 00:22:52.451
Me. I'll record the scores
after each date.


542
00:22:52.625 --> 00:22:55.846
Wow, if I knew you were keeping
score I would have shaved.


543
00:22:56.020 --> 00:22:58.283
We go on three different
types of dates


544
00:22:58.457 --> 00:23:01.765
to compare our compatibility
in different settings.


545
00:23:01.939 --> 00:23:02.983
Hm.

546
00:23:03.157 --> 00:23:04.985
What? It's in your folder.

547
00:23:05.159 --> 00:23:06.552
I'm sure.

548
00:23:06.726 --> 00:23:08.554
After tonight's introductory
date,


549
00:23:08.728 --> 00:23:12.863
we go on a stress-inducing date
followed by a romantic date.


550
00:23:13.037 --> 00:23:15.256
We'll finish in a week.
Do you want to go first?


551
00:23:15.431 --> 00:23:18.259
Uh, for what?

552
00:23:18.434 --> 00:23:20.914
The list of questions.
It's in your folder.


553
00:23:21.088 --> 00:23:22.916
Hm. Well I...
You know what,


554
00:23:23.090 --> 00:23:24.503
I thought we'd just get
to know each other


555
00:23:24.527 --> 00:23:26.355
a little bit before we...

556
00:23:26.529 --> 00:23:28.550
You were born and raised in New
Hampshire, youngest of three.


557
00:23:28.574 --> 00:23:30.446
Father a teacher,
mother a nurse.


558
00:23:30.620 --> 00:23:33.318
Undergrad Yukon,
Cornell veterinary school.


559
00:23:33.492 --> 00:23:36.190
Ten months ago you opened
Jolly Rovers Rescue


560
00:23:36.365 --> 00:23:38.497
and based on your
social media posts,


561
00:23:38.671 --> 00:23:41.979
you have a very attractive
girlfriend.


562
00:23:42.153 --> 00:23:44.285
- Impressive.
- Thanks.


563
00:23:44.460 --> 00:23:46.940
Not so sure about
the girlfriend right now.


564
00:23:47.114 --> 00:23:49.290
You were born in Muncie,
Indiana.


565
00:23:49.465 --> 00:23:50.944
Younger brother in Texas,

566
00:23:51.118 --> 00:23:52.661
mother and father both
college professors.


567
00:23:52.685 --> 00:23:54.383
University of Chicago
undergraduate,


568
00:23:54.557 --> 00:23:58.996
PhD at Columbia with a focus
on social psychology.


569
00:23:59.170 --> 00:24:03.304
Known for your pioneering
studies on the science of love.


570
00:24:03.479 --> 00:24:06.177
- TouchÃ©.
- Hm.


571
00:24:06.351 --> 00:24:08.832
Now, the list of questions.

572
00:24:09.006 --> 00:24:10.224
Where's your folder?

573
00:24:10.399 --> 00:24:12.662
- On here.
- Well, of course it is.


574
00:24:13.967 --> 00:24:15.360
Ah. Ok.

575
00:24:21.148 --> 00:24:23.368
- Ah, hmm.
- Thank you.


576
00:24:25.762 --> 00:24:27.894
Alright. Name three things
you and your partner


577
00:24:28.068 --> 00:24:29.592
appear to have in common.

578
00:24:29.766 --> 00:24:32.203
- Uh, we're both human.
- I think that's cheating.


579
00:24:32.377 --> 00:24:34.945
Ok. Uh, we both live
in the same city.


580
00:24:35.119 --> 00:24:36.294
One.

581
00:24:36.468 --> 00:24:37.948
- We're both doctors.
- Two.


582
00:24:38.122 --> 00:24:39.122
We both...

583
00:24:40.080 --> 00:24:41.995
Let's see. We both...

584
00:24:42.169 --> 00:24:43.669
We both are stumped
on the third thing


585
00:24:43.693 --> 00:24:44.433
that we have in common.

586
00:24:44.607 --> 00:24:46.260
Good enough. Ok.

587
00:24:46.435 --> 00:24:48.395
Name something you consider
to be a positive trait


588
00:24:48.480 --> 00:24:50.090
in your partner.

589
00:24:53.050 --> 00:24:55.226
- Next.
- Next.


590
00:24:55.400 --> 00:24:56.749
Mm.

591
00:24:57.228 --> 00:24:58.838
Oh, I got one here.

592
00:24:59.012 --> 00:25:01.014
When did you last sing
to yourself?


593
00:25:01.188 --> 00:25:02.233
Never.

594
00:25:02.407 --> 00:25:02.929
You never sing to yourself?

595
00:25:03.103 --> 00:25:04.496
Never.

596
00:25:04.670 --> 00:25:06.110
So what, you've never
done karaoke?


597
00:25:06.280 --> 00:25:10.067
Once, which also answers
question 16.


598
00:25:10.241 --> 00:25:12.852
Share an embarrassing moment
in your life.


599
00:25:13.026 --> 00:25:17.117
Hm. Well, I sing to myself
from time to time,


600
00:25:17.291 --> 00:25:18.945
around the house.

601
00:25:19.119 --> 00:25:22.862
Had to be you,
it had to be you, huh?


602
00:25:25.256 --> 00:25:27.867
Yeah. Why don't you sing
to yourself?


603
00:25:28.041 --> 00:25:28.694
That's why.

604
00:25:28.868 --> 00:25:30.957
Ho, ho, ho, ok.

605
00:25:31.131 --> 00:25:33.264
For the jugular
on the first date.


606
00:25:33.438 --> 00:25:36.833
Ok, why don't we just do this
or that questions.


607
00:25:37.007 --> 00:25:38.182
Sure.

608
00:25:38.356 --> 00:25:41.881
Cat or dog?
That's a gimme.


609
00:25:42.055 --> 00:25:43.100
TV or book?

610
00:25:43.274 --> 00:25:45.798
Book.

611
00:25:45.972 --> 00:25:48.584
- Cake or pie?
- Cake.


612
00:25:51.587 --> 00:25:53.110
I'm on a roll here.

613
00:25:56.766 --> 00:26:00.117
Ok. Passenger or driver?

614
00:26:00.291 --> 00:26:02.293
Passenger. You get
to see more things.


615
00:26:02.467 --> 00:26:06.297
Driver you're more in control.
Winter or summer?


616
00:26:06.471 --> 00:26:07.080
Winter.

617
00:26:07.254 --> 00:26:08.254
Summer.

618
00:26:08.342 --> 00:26:09.343
Baseball or football?

619
00:26:09.518 --> 00:26:10.867
Football.

620
00:26:11.041 --> 00:26:12.441
I don't do sports.
Lions or bears?


621
00:26:12.608 --> 00:26:13.608
Lions.

622
00:26:13.652 --> 00:26:15.349
Bears, by six points.

623
00:26:17.482 --> 00:26:19.702
Oh, you really don't do sports.

624
00:26:22.139 --> 00:26:24.010
Oh, excuse me.

625
00:26:25.969 --> 00:26:27.840
Oh, no. I have an emergency.

626
00:26:28.014 --> 00:26:30.843
Uh, a dog has an
obstructed airway.


627
00:26:31.017 --> 00:26:32.017
Oh, you have to go?

628
00:26:32.149 --> 00:26:33.585
Afraid so.

629
00:26:33.759 --> 00:26:35.559
Well, I understand.
Maybe we can reschedule?


630
00:26:35.718 --> 00:26:38.372
Maybe not. You can come
with me.


631
00:26:38.547 --> 00:26:39.547
To the dog rescue?

632
00:26:39.591 --> 00:26:40.940
Dog adoption center.

633
00:26:41.114 --> 00:26:42.463
Yeah, this is a quick procedure

634
00:26:42.638 --> 00:26:43.998
and then we can
pick up afterwards.


635
00:26:44.030 --> 00:26:45.510
Okay.

636
00:26:45.684 --> 00:26:47.364
Hate to see you revise
your spreadsheets.


637
00:26:57.174 --> 00:26:58.412
How long has he been
breathing like this?


638
00:26:58.436 --> 00:27:00.003
Since he came in.

639
00:27:00.177 --> 00:27:07.053
Okay. Alright, buddy.
Let me see. Okay. Okay.


640
00:27:07.227 --> 00:27:10.230
Yeah, yeah, it's obstructing
his airway.


641
00:27:10.404 --> 00:27:11.841
It's really far in though.

642
00:27:12.015 --> 00:27:13.514
Should I sedate him
for an extraction?


643
00:27:13.538 --> 00:27:15.279
No, I don't think there's time.

644
00:27:15.453 --> 00:27:18.456
Um, I have an idea, it's not
conventional but it works.


645
00:27:18.630 --> 00:27:20.327
Ok.

646
00:27:20.501 --> 00:27:20.980
Uh, Brooke, you might
want to back up a little bit.


647
00:27:21.154 --> 00:27:22.286
Oh, ok.

648
00:27:22.460 --> 00:27:26.072
Ok, buddy.
Yeah. You ready?


649
00:27:26.246 --> 00:27:34.037
Three, two, one.
There you go, buddy.


650
00:27:34.211 --> 00:27:35.211
Good job.

651
00:27:37.040 --> 00:27:39.912
Ok. Good job.

652
00:27:40.086 --> 00:27:42.915
Oh boy.

653
00:27:46.615 --> 00:27:50.967
So, why a vet?
Why not a people doctor?


654
00:27:51.141 --> 00:27:53.491
Other than cheaper
malpractice premiums?


655
00:27:53.665 --> 00:27:54.666
I don't know.

656
00:27:54.840 --> 00:27:57.582
It's just, always loved animals.

657
00:27:57.756 --> 00:28:01.804
A vet that runs a dog
adoption business.


658
00:28:01.978 --> 00:28:04.067
Right. Before that I was
in a private practice


659
00:28:04.241 --> 00:28:06.286
with a business partner.

660
00:28:06.460 --> 00:28:07.897
Why'd you give it up?

661
00:28:08.071 --> 00:28:10.334
Well, I still practice
veterinary care,


662
00:28:10.508 --> 00:28:12.118
but running a dog
adoption center


663
00:28:12.292 --> 00:28:15.208
had always been
a life-long dream.


664
00:28:15.382 --> 00:28:17.036
Nice.

665
00:28:17.210 --> 00:28:19.822
Being a scientist was always
my life-long dream.


666
00:28:19.996 --> 00:28:20.779
What do you know?

667
00:28:20.953 --> 00:28:22.433
What?

668
00:28:22.607 --> 00:28:24.287
That's the third thing
we have in common.


669
00:28:24.435 --> 00:28:25.915
Both in our dream jobs.

670
00:28:26.089 --> 00:28:27.090
Hm.

671
00:28:29.483 --> 00:28:32.008
- It's my stop.
- Mm-hm.


672
00:28:32.182 --> 00:28:33.923
- So, about tomorrow's date.
- Hm?


673
00:28:34.097 --> 00:28:37.187
Choose an activity that induces
high levels of stress.


674
00:28:37.361 --> 00:28:39.929
Oh, oh, oh, oh, I know mine.

675
00:28:40.103 --> 00:28:41.800
I know mine.
I'll text you.


676
00:28:41.974 --> 00:28:44.107
I'll text you back.

677
00:28:44.281 --> 00:28:47.284
- So, one down...
- Two to go.


678
00:28:47.458 --> 00:28:49.068
Was that the weirdest date ever?

679
00:28:49.242 --> 00:28:51.462
Absolutely. Who plans their
dates with spreadsheets?


680
00:28:51.636 --> 00:28:56.510
- I meant the choking dog.
- Yeah, that too.


681
00:28:59.949 --> 00:29:06.433
- Well. Goodnight, Doctor Carver.
- Goodnight, Doctor Bennett.


682
00:29:12.135 --> 00:29:14.485
So? How was your date?

683
00:29:14.659 --> 00:29:18.228
It went fine. Until a dog
spit rawhide at me.


684
00:29:18.402 --> 00:29:19.882
What? In the restaurant?

685
00:29:20.056 --> 00:29:21.797
No, I went with him
on an emergency call.


686
00:29:21.971 --> 00:29:23.320
He gave the Heimlich to a dog

687
00:29:23.494 --> 00:29:25.801
choking on one of
those rawhide things.


688
00:29:25.975 --> 00:29:28.020
It was pretty funny actually.

689
00:29:28.194 --> 00:29:29.848
I don't know, Brooke.

690
00:29:30.022 --> 00:29:31.260
Sounds to me like you did
more than grin and bear it.


691
00:29:31.284 --> 00:29:34.984
Oh, stop, Carly.
Warrior two.


692
00:29:36.986 --> 00:29:38.509
What was his score?

693
00:29:38.683 --> 00:29:40.816
Actually, I think I need
to recalibrate the...


694
00:29:40.990 --> 00:29:41.990
Brooke.

695
00:29:42.078 --> 00:29:43.296
88

696
00:29:43.470 --> 00:29:45.298
Wow. Impressive
for a first date.


697
00:29:45.472 --> 00:29:46.912
Sometimes multi-variant
data can...


698
00:29:47.083 --> 00:29:48.998
And your score?

699
00:29:49.172 --> 00:29:50.956
89.

700
00:29:51.130 --> 00:29:53.393
You two are approaching
ideal match territory.


701
00:29:53.567 --> 00:29:56.092
It's probably just an anomaly.

702
00:29:56.266 --> 00:29:58.374
Not for someone who has "in data
we trust" tattooed on her...


703
00:29:58.398 --> 00:30:01.140
Stop. How was your date?

704
00:30:01.314 --> 00:30:03.012
Ugh, disaster.

705
00:30:03.186 --> 00:30:04.927
Never made it past
the second question.


706
00:30:05.101 --> 00:30:06.426
What? Name the last book
you read?


707
00:30:06.450 --> 00:30:07.930
He said "War and Peace".

708
00:30:08.104 --> 00:30:10.106
I mean, no one actually reads
"War and Peace".


709
00:30:10.280 --> 00:30:11.280
He might have.

710
00:30:11.411 --> 00:30:12.411
Have you read it?

711
00:30:12.499 --> 00:30:14.023
I started it.

712
00:30:14.197 --> 00:30:17.374
Exactly. He was just trying
to impress me.


713
00:30:17.548 --> 00:30:20.594
Ok, well you should actually
do all of the questions.


714
00:30:20.769 --> 00:30:22.169
I'm taking the speed
dating route.


715
00:30:22.205 --> 00:30:23.989
Only asking three questions.

716
00:30:24.163 --> 00:30:26.620
Name a cheesy song you love, who
would be your ideal dinner guest


717
00:30:26.644 --> 00:30:29.995
and what's the most beautiful
view you've ever seen.


718
00:30:30.169 --> 00:30:31.538
And that's your plan to finding
the perfect match?


719
00:30:31.562 --> 00:30:33.433
Yes.

720
00:30:33.607 --> 00:30:36.393
I want a guy who reads poetry
and loves sappy love songs.


721
00:30:36.567 --> 00:30:37.967
Who wants to have dinner
with Plato.


722
00:30:38.047 --> 00:30:39.396
Not J Lo.

723
00:30:39.570 --> 00:30:43.008
- What about Vince?
- What about Vince?


724
00:30:43.182 --> 00:30:44.923
You don't notice the way
he looks at you


725
00:30:45.097 --> 00:30:47.578
with that shy boyish smile?

726
00:30:47.752 --> 00:30:50.929
Brooke, he looks at everyone
with that shy, boyish smile.


727
00:30:51.103 --> 00:30:52.975
Mm-hm. If you say so.

728
00:30:53.149 --> 00:30:56.065
So, what's your
big date tonight?


729
00:30:56.239 --> 00:30:58.284
The stress-inducing date.

730
00:31:00.199 --> 00:31:02.158
Downward dog.

731
00:31:05.596 --> 00:31:07.076
That's your downward dog?

732
00:31:07.250 --> 00:31:09.687
No, this is my tired dog.

733
00:31:23.962 --> 00:31:25.311
I can't do this.

734
00:31:25.485 --> 00:31:27.923
- You haven't bowled yet.
- I know, but...


735
00:31:28.097 --> 00:31:32.362
- Brooke. It's just a game.
- Oh, no. This game is evil.


736
00:31:32.536 --> 00:31:35.974
Its sole purpose is to torment,
ridicule and degrade.


737
00:31:36.148 --> 00:31:39.021
Leaving people without
a scrap of dignity.


738
00:31:39.195 --> 00:31:40.500
Bowling?

739
00:31:40.674 --> 00:31:42.067
Everyone watching you

740
00:31:42.241 --> 00:31:44.853
while you're making a fool
of yourself.


741
00:31:45.027 --> 00:31:47.246
I mean, that's the fun of it.

742
00:31:47.420 --> 00:31:50.641
Do I look like I'm having fun?

743
00:31:50.815 --> 00:31:54.993
Uh, ok. Um, I won't look.

744
00:31:58.170 --> 00:31:59.563
Very chivalrous of you.

745
00:32:01.304 --> 00:32:02.958
Ok, don't look.

746
00:32:03.132 --> 00:32:05.264
I'm not. I'm not looking.
I won't.


747
00:32:22.151 --> 00:32:24.066
That didn't sound great.

748
00:32:26.068 --> 00:32:27.199
It looked even worse.

749
00:32:28.070 --> 00:32:29.506
- Can I look now?
- No.


750
00:32:29.680 --> 00:32:31.290
Let me go again.

751
00:32:37.427 --> 00:32:40.169
That sounded better.

752
00:32:40.343 --> 00:32:43.694
You really are a terrible liar.
Just go.


753
00:32:45.696 --> 00:32:47.045
Hey, that wasn't easy.

754
00:32:47.219 --> 00:32:48.960
I should get bonus points
or something.


755
00:32:49.134 --> 00:32:52.137
I mean, it's not surprising
when you are bowling with these.


756
00:32:52.311 --> 00:32:54.550
It's really not that hard.
Can I just show you one thing?


757
00:32:54.574 --> 00:32:56.054
- Sure.
- Ok.


758
00:33:03.453 --> 00:33:07.848
Alright. Now, you want
to swing your arm back,


759
00:33:08.023 --> 00:33:12.810
keep your wrist straight
and as you swing forward,


760
00:33:12.984 --> 00:33:14.377
release the ball.

761
00:33:14.551 --> 00:33:15.334
But remember, keep
your wrist straight.


762
00:33:15.508 --> 00:33:17.902
- Ok.
- Alright.


763
00:33:18.076 --> 00:33:19.599
- I think I have it.
- Ok. Great.


764
00:33:22.472 --> 00:33:25.257
Ok, wrist straight.

765
00:33:35.311 --> 00:33:37.878
Yes!

766
00:33:45.321 --> 00:33:47.236
See, it's all in the wrist.

767
00:33:47.410 --> 00:33:51.196
Yeah, thanks.
Your turn.


768
00:33:54.417 --> 00:33:55.418
Alright.

769
00:34:10.085 --> 00:34:11.521
- Yeah!!
- Oh!


770
00:34:12.348 --> 00:34:14.959
It's all in the wrist.

771
00:34:18.006 --> 00:34:19.006
Thank you.

772
00:34:22.010 --> 00:34:23.837
Well, I survived.

773
00:34:24.012 --> 00:34:25.361
Well, more than survived,

774
00:34:25.535 --> 00:34:28.189
you bowled a perfectly
respectable 63.


775
00:34:28.364 --> 00:34:31.019
So, what if someone scored a

776
00:34:31.193 --> 00:34:33.325
Only a 63?
Probably not a keeper,


777
00:34:33.499 --> 00:34:37.068
but that's why we go on three
dates. I take the average.


778
00:34:37.242 --> 00:34:40.810
Hm. curious, what was my score
after the first date?


779
00:34:40.984 --> 00:34:43.466
I only reveal the scores
at the end.


780
00:34:43.640 --> 00:34:45.990
No exceptions?

781
00:34:46.164 --> 00:34:47.905
You were above 63.

782
00:34:48.079 --> 00:34:51.169
Oh yes. I'm perfectly
respectable.


783
00:34:51.343 --> 00:34:53.519
So, what is it with you
and bowling?


784
00:34:53.693 --> 00:34:57.523
- Childhood trauma.
- Left a scar?


785
00:34:57.697 --> 00:35:01.266
On me and almost on several
eight-year-old boys.


786
00:35:01.440 --> 00:35:03.181
Wow. There's a story there.

787
00:35:03.355 --> 00:35:06.402
My brother's eighth birthday,
I was 10.


788
00:35:06.576 --> 00:35:08.317
We had a bowling party.

789
00:35:08.491 --> 00:35:11.537
I was warming up, you know,
getting the old arm limber


790
00:35:11.711 --> 00:35:14.975
and holding onto my ball and
swinging my ball back and forth


791
00:35:15.150 --> 00:35:18.283
and back and forth and...
it slipped.


792
00:35:18.457 --> 00:35:20.068
This can't end well.

793
00:35:20.242 --> 00:35:22.374
Ball flew out of my hand,
took out the birthday boy


794
00:35:22.548 --> 00:35:24.333
and three of his friends
and the party clown.


795
00:35:24.507 --> 00:35:26.161
That clown probably
had it coming.


796
00:35:26.335 --> 00:35:29.077
No one got hurt but the ball
didn't stop rolling


797
00:35:29.251 --> 00:35:32.167
until it smashed
into the snack bar.


798
00:35:32.341 --> 00:35:34.101
I can still see the look
on that little boy's face


799
00:35:34.125 --> 00:35:35.822
as he saw it coming towards him.

800
00:35:35.996 --> 00:35:37.520
His loaded nachos
went everywhere.


801
00:35:37.694 --> 00:35:39.870
- That's traumatic.
- Expensive too.


802
00:35:40.044 --> 00:35:41.524
I mean, insurance only covers
so much.


803
00:35:41.567 --> 00:35:43.395
Right.

804
00:35:43.569 --> 00:35:45.678
So, what makes your half of
tonight's dates so stressful?


805
00:35:45.702 --> 00:35:47.095
Well, you'll see.

806
00:35:47.269 --> 00:35:48.922
Did we get through
all those questions?


807
00:35:49.097 --> 00:35:53.013
Uh, there's still a few more.
Oh, here's a good one.


808
00:35:53.188 --> 00:35:55.277
Describe a perfect day
you've had.


809
00:35:55.451 --> 00:35:56.495
Uh.

810
00:35:56.669 --> 00:35:57.844
I know mine.

811
00:35:58.018 --> 00:35:59.368
Go for it.

812
00:35:59.542 --> 00:36:01.370
Well, it's mostly perfect

813
00:36:01.544 --> 00:36:04.547
because it started off
so imperfectly.


814
00:36:04.721 --> 00:36:06.331
When I was a little girl,

815
00:36:06.505 --> 00:36:11.249
I was at my cousin's wedding
and I lost Screech.


816
00:36:11.423 --> 00:36:12.772
Screech?

817
00:36:12.946 --> 00:36:14.731
My stuffed snowy owl.
I was devastated.


818
00:36:14.905 --> 00:36:16.080
Inconsolable.

819
00:36:16.254 --> 00:36:18.778
Well, I was the flower girl

820
00:36:18.952 --> 00:36:21.041
and I was supposed to carry
white lilies.


821
00:36:21.216 --> 00:36:22.217
Nice.

822
00:36:22.391 --> 00:36:24.436
But, when I got to the church,

823
00:36:24.610 --> 00:36:29.485
the bride handed me this huge
bouquet of sunflowers.


824
00:36:29.659 --> 00:36:31.791
I hear you're fond of those.

825
00:36:31.965 --> 00:36:34.881
She said they would brighten
even the darkest day.


826
00:36:35.055 --> 00:36:36.579
And they did.

827
00:36:36.753 --> 00:36:38.842
It was the most beautiful thing
I had ever seen.


828
00:36:39.016 --> 00:36:40.336
More beautiful than a snowy owl?

829
00:36:40.409 --> 00:36:42.976
Definitely. But not as cuddly.

830
00:36:43.151 --> 00:36:45.109
Still, it cheered me up

831
00:36:45.283 --> 00:36:47.083
and even today whenever
I need a pick me up...


832
00:36:47.198 --> 00:36:49.418
You buy sunflowers
standing order.


833
00:36:49.592 --> 00:36:51.333
They're just happy flowers.

834
00:36:51.507 --> 00:36:52.986
Sounds pretty perfect.

835
00:36:53.161 --> 00:36:54.901
So, what about you?

836
00:36:55.075 --> 00:36:56.990
That's gonna have to wait
because it is time


837
00:36:57.165 --> 00:36:58.862
for my stress-inducing date.

838
00:36:59.036 --> 00:37:00.951
More stressful than bowling?

839
00:37:01.125 --> 00:37:02.387
Yes.

840
00:37:02.561 --> 00:37:06.478
And for you,
definitely more painful.


841
00:37:22.973 --> 00:37:24.844
- I warned you.
- You're not that bad.


842
00:37:25.018 --> 00:37:26.803
You're a worse liar than me.

843
00:37:34.506 --> 00:37:37.814
Oh, sorry, sorry.
We should-this was a bad idea.


844
00:37:37.988 --> 00:37:41.165
It's no worse than bowling.
And that ended ok.


845
00:37:41.339 --> 00:37:43.820
True, except bowling was
only stressful for one of us.


846
00:37:43.994 --> 00:37:46.170
Well, this isn't stressful
for me. Painful maybe.


847
00:37:58.617 --> 00:38:01.011
I feel like I'm back
in high school.


848
00:38:01.185 --> 00:38:02.641
You went to your
high school dances?


849
00:38:02.665 --> 00:38:06.234
A few. What, you didn't?

850
00:38:06.408 --> 00:38:08.018
A few.

851
00:38:09.149 --> 00:38:10.325
Oh.

852
00:38:12.109 --> 00:38:15.808
Let me guess, you were the shy
girl at the back of the gym?


853
00:38:15.982 --> 00:38:17.680
Yeah.

854
00:38:17.854 --> 00:38:20.335
Big thick glasses,
before you got your contacts.


855
00:38:20.509 --> 00:38:22.162
Yep.

856
00:38:22.337 --> 00:38:24.948
Hoping that that weird,
annoying kid in science class


857
00:38:25.122 --> 00:38:26.906
didn't ask you to dance?

858
00:38:27.080 --> 00:38:29.779
Ken Friss.

859
00:38:29.953 --> 00:38:32.216
That kid was a wizard
with a petri dish.


860
00:38:32.390 --> 00:38:33.870
He has an annoying name.

861
00:38:38.091 --> 00:38:40.529
I bet you were the guy all
the girls wanted to dance with.


862
00:38:40.703 --> 00:38:42.052
Uh, no.

863
00:38:42.226 --> 00:38:44.010
No, I was more like
your buddy Ken.


864
00:38:44.184 --> 00:38:47.971
Just trying to work up the
courage to ask that shy girl


865
00:38:48.145 --> 00:38:51.583
with big thick glasses to dance.

866
00:38:53.150 --> 00:38:55.065
I'm always going for the strong
silent type.


867
00:39:01.027 --> 00:39:02.768
Woah! Sorry.

868
00:39:02.942 --> 00:39:04.050
I think we should just stop.

869
00:39:04.074 --> 00:39:05.423
Come on, you two.

870
00:39:05.597 --> 00:39:06.922
I could drive a truck
through there.


871
00:39:06.946 --> 00:39:08.731
Get closer.

872
00:39:08.905 --> 00:39:10.646
- Oh!
- Isn't that better?


873
00:39:12.952 --> 00:39:15.868
And a little bit less swaying.
You look like drunk sailors.


874
00:39:16.042 --> 00:39:18.828
Remember, it's one, two,
three and back.


875
00:39:19.002 --> 00:39:19.698
One, two, three.

876
00:39:19.872 --> 00:39:21.221
Try.

877
00:39:21.396 --> 00:39:22.962
One, two, three.

878
00:39:25.922 --> 00:39:29.969
Oh, sorry. Sorry.

879
00:39:30.143 --> 00:39:35.497
Ok, what if I try leading, if
that wouldn't wound your ego?


880
00:39:35.671 --> 00:39:39.762
- No, better than wounding you.
- Ok.


881
00:39:39.936 --> 00:39:42.417
- Should we take it from the top?
- Mm-hm.


882
00:39:47.247 --> 00:39:49.511
Oooh.

883
00:39:53.210 --> 00:39:58.824
Hey! I'm dancing
without maiming anybody.


884
00:40:31.509 --> 00:40:33.859
So, other than proving
that you're as bad at bowling


885
00:40:34.033 --> 00:40:37.472
as I am at dancing, what was
the purpose of tonight?


886
00:40:37.646 --> 00:40:39.865
Relationships aren't
all wine and roses.


887
00:40:40.039 --> 00:40:41.879
People need to see how they
react to each other


888
00:40:42.041 --> 00:40:43.391
during times of stress.

889
00:40:43.565 --> 00:40:45.349
The biosensor tells you that?

890
00:40:45.523 --> 00:40:47.917
It measures norepinephrine,
the stress hormone.


891
00:40:48.091 --> 00:40:49.701
Hm.

892
00:40:49.875 --> 00:40:51.549
Can love really be explained
so scientifically?


893
00:40:51.573 --> 00:40:53.879
I mean, there's no room
for mystery and magic?


894
00:40:54.053 --> 00:40:55.054
Only in fairy tales.

895
00:40:55.228 --> 00:40:56.534
Well not for me.

896
00:40:56.708 --> 00:40:58.188
I'm a love at first sight
kind of guy.


897
00:40:58.318 --> 00:40:59.905
You don't think you can grow
to love someone?


898
00:40:59.929 --> 00:41:01.609
Not if you don't feel that
lightning bolt


899
00:41:01.670 --> 00:41:03.367
the first time you meet.

900
00:41:03.541 --> 00:41:06.892
I mean, it is such
an amazing feeling.


901
00:41:07.066 --> 00:41:09.939
It's like your heart's about
to burst.


902
00:41:10.113 --> 00:41:13.899
It's very romantic.
And, messy.


903
00:41:16.554 --> 00:41:18.556
- Ryan there's-
- But then-


904
00:41:18.730 --> 00:41:21.820
- Sorry. You go.

905
00:41:21.994 --> 00:41:23.779
I want to be clear with you.

906
00:41:23.953 --> 00:41:28.827
I'm only doing the test
with you to say I did the test.


907
00:41:29.001 --> 00:41:30.655
No, I figured.

908
00:41:30.829 --> 00:41:34.572
Yeah, I saw your video on
social media, Doctor Cupid.


909
00:41:34.746 --> 00:41:37.532
Truthfully, I'm done
with dating.


910
00:41:37.706 --> 00:41:39.577
I mean, actual dating.

911
00:41:39.751 --> 00:41:44.016
My history with men is a joke
and I'm always the punchline.


912
00:41:44.190 --> 00:41:45.540
Hm.

913
00:41:45.714 --> 00:41:47.585
I'm not having my heart
broken again.


914
00:41:47.759 --> 00:41:49.389
I thought you didn't believe
in broken hearts?


915
00:41:49.413 --> 00:41:51.937
I don't. But it sounds better

916
00:41:52.111 --> 00:41:54.592
than a precipitous drop
in oxytocin levels.


917
00:41:57.160 --> 00:41:59.051
Well, I guess you should know
that I'm only doing this


918
00:41:59.075 --> 00:42:01.425
to win back my girlfriend.

919
00:42:01.599 --> 00:42:03.601
How will this help you
win her back?


920
00:42:03.775 --> 00:42:07.779
Well, Taylor and I came
and saw your talk that night


921
00:42:07.953 --> 00:42:10.086
and after she wanted
to take the test


922
00:42:10.260 --> 00:42:12.871
and I kind of made fun of her.

923
00:42:13.045 --> 00:42:14.569
I like her already.

924
00:42:14.743 --> 00:42:17.310
Well, I guess I'm trying
to do this to show her


925
00:42:17.485 --> 00:42:18.964
that I'm taking it seriously.

926
00:42:19.138 --> 00:42:21.358
Taking her seriously,
you know, impress her.


927
00:42:21.532 --> 00:42:23.012
So, let's impress her.

928
00:42:23.186 --> 00:42:26.189
Let's show her you wooing
the socks off of me


929
00:42:26.363 --> 00:42:27.799
and only the socks.

930
00:42:27.973 --> 00:42:29.671
How?

931
00:42:29.845 --> 00:42:31.562
The university wants me to do
a video tomorrow night


932
00:42:31.586 --> 00:42:33.215
and talk about how I'm doing
the study with you.


933
00:42:33.239 --> 00:42:34.919
You know, strange bed fellows
and all that.


934
00:42:35.067 --> 00:42:36.547
Ok.

935
00:42:36.721 --> 00:42:37.330
They think it will diffuse
the viral video.


936
00:42:37.505 --> 00:42:38.854
Hmm.

937
00:42:39.028 --> 00:42:40.899
So, why don't you be
in the video too?


938
00:42:41.073 --> 00:42:43.075
We just have to make sure
Taylor's there.


939
00:42:43.249 --> 00:42:45.121
Yeah, I can probably
arrange that.


940
00:42:45.295 --> 00:42:49.995
And I'll act all, you know,
charmed by your witty repartee.


941
00:42:50.169 --> 00:42:51.669
Well, maybe you could do like
a hair flick thing.


942
00:42:51.693 --> 00:42:53.172
Oh, you mean like this?

943
00:42:53.346 --> 00:42:54.957
Oh, very convincing.

944
00:42:56.611 --> 00:42:57.971
Great. I'll text you
the details.


945
00:42:58.134 --> 00:42:59.483
Great.

946
00:42:59.657 --> 00:43:01.093
And then tomorrow's
our last date?


947
00:43:01.267 --> 00:43:03.835
The romantic date with gifts.
Then we're done.


948
00:43:04.009 --> 00:43:06.011
Perfect.

949
00:43:06.185 --> 00:43:09.928
Oh, can you do that hair flick
thing one more time?


950
00:43:10.102 --> 00:43:11.974
Save it for tomorrow.

951
00:43:18.371 --> 00:43:21.853
Wait, wait, wait.
What do you mean "spark"?


952
00:43:22.027 --> 00:43:23.551
When we were dancing.

953
00:43:23.725 --> 00:43:26.118
You mean like a bzzt spark,
or like a boom,


954
00:43:26.292 --> 00:43:27.487
love at first sight
kind of thing?


955
00:43:27.511 --> 00:43:28.904
Definitely not a kaboom.

956
00:43:29.078 --> 00:43:30.470
Was more like a flicker,
you know?


957
00:43:30.645 --> 00:43:32.385
It was like a warm tingle.

958
00:43:32.560 --> 00:43:35.432
Ok, that sounds serious.

959
00:43:35.606 --> 00:43:38.261
It's actually just nothing
like I expected, you know?


960
00:43:38.435 --> 00:43:42.874
She's more flexible
and self-deprecating.


961
00:43:43.048 --> 00:43:44.048
She's funny.

962
00:43:44.136 --> 00:43:45.573
Hold on, time out.

963
00:43:45.747 --> 00:43:47.202
Are you talking about
spreadsheet woman?


964
00:43:47.226 --> 00:43:48.880
Yes. She's got a whole
other side.


965
00:43:49.054 --> 00:43:51.100
A fun side, you know?

966
00:43:51.274 --> 00:43:52.643
I mean, you should have seen
her bowling.


967
00:43:52.667 --> 00:43:54.494
She was great.
She was funny.


968
00:43:54.669 --> 00:43:57.193
She's just fun.

969
00:43:57.367 --> 00:43:58.934
What?

970
00:43:59.108 --> 00:44:01.893
The look on your face,
like a lovesick puppy.


971
00:44:02.067 --> 00:44:04.002
Yeah, well she also said
that she's only doing it


972
00:44:04.026 --> 00:44:05.810
so that she can say
that she did it.


973
00:44:05.984 --> 00:44:07.812
You know, it's a PR thing
for her.


974
00:44:07.986 --> 00:44:09.616
Well that's fair. You're only
doing it to impress Taylor.


975
00:44:09.640 --> 00:44:10.640
I told her that.

976
00:44:10.772 --> 00:44:12.251
Really? What did she say?

977
00:44:12.425 --> 00:44:15.167
She said that she wants
to help me woo Taylor.


978
00:44:15.341 --> 00:44:17.866
Seriously? How?

979
00:44:18.040 --> 00:44:20.303
Ok, I need you to bring Taylor

980
00:44:20.477 --> 00:44:22.958
to the theater at Pemberton,

981
00:44:23.132 --> 00:44:24.829
Tonight? What for?

982
00:44:25.003 --> 00:44:27.832
I'm gonna do a video with
Brooke, ok?


983
00:44:28.006 --> 00:44:29.660
Huh.

984
00:44:29.834 --> 00:44:30.618
The university thinks
it's gonna take some air out


985
00:44:30.792 --> 00:44:32.576
of this viral video

986
00:44:32.750 --> 00:44:33.490
and I think it's gonna show
Taylor I'm taking her seriously.


987
00:44:33.664 --> 00:44:35.318
Ah! I get it.

988
00:44:35.492 --> 00:44:38.016
Now, but don't tell Taylor
that I'm in the video.


989
00:44:38.190 --> 00:44:40.584
Surprising her? Ok.
What do you want me to say?


990
00:44:40.758 --> 00:44:43.195
Anything. Just make sure
she's there at 7:30PM, ok?


991
00:44:43.369 --> 00:44:44.066
Got it.

992
00:44:44.240 --> 00:44:45.415
Thank you.

993
00:44:51.160 --> 00:44:55.207
Hey, Soph, listen.
I need a favor.


994
00:45:04.129 --> 00:45:06.088
I understand we have
a special guest tonight?


995
00:45:06.262 --> 00:45:07.742
Yes, I invited Ryan.

996
00:45:07.916 --> 00:45:09.787
Pure genius, Brooke.

997
00:45:09.961 --> 00:45:12.321
And we'll link tonight's video
with the one that went viral.


998
00:45:12.355 --> 00:45:14.159
People will see you're taking
the test with him and...


999
00:45:14.183 --> 00:45:15.010
Crisis averted.

1000
00:45:15.184 --> 00:45:16.751
We'll do our best.

1001
00:45:16.925 --> 00:45:18.424
And I'm sorry you're just
seeing this now, Brooke.


1002
00:45:18.448 --> 00:45:20.537
I had to revise it
when I heard about Ryan.


1003
00:45:20.711 --> 00:45:22.104
A script?

1004
00:45:22.278 --> 00:45:23.845
Vince, I can't memorize
this in time.


1005
00:45:24.019 --> 00:45:26.282
Oh, no worries.
It'll be on prompters.


1006
00:45:26.456 --> 00:45:29.111
We just want to play it safe.
No more surprises.


1007
00:45:29.285 --> 00:45:31.766
Well, break a leg.

1008
00:45:31.940 --> 00:45:32.940
Oh, sorry, Vince.

1009
00:45:33.028 --> 00:45:34.943
Oh, Carly. Hi.

1010
00:45:35.117 --> 00:45:39.251
So, I'll be in the back.
You are going to crush this.


1011
00:45:39.425 --> 00:45:41.601
Thanks Carly.

1012
00:45:42.385 --> 00:45:43.985
Looks like you two are falling
in love.


1013
00:45:44.126 --> 00:45:46.955
Oh, um, the scores
are surprising


1014
00:45:47.129 --> 00:45:49.914
but it's still the average
that counts.


1015
00:45:50.088 --> 00:45:51.960
You remind me of myself
when I was your age.


1016
00:45:52.134 --> 00:45:55.877
A rising scientist thinking I
could save the world with data.


1017
00:45:56.051 --> 00:45:58.053
When it came to dating,
I had a checklist.


1018
00:45:58.227 --> 00:46:00.011
Wanted to meet the perfect man.

1019
00:46:00.185 --> 00:46:03.145
Eventually, I met someone
who checked off all the boxes.


1020
00:46:03.319 --> 00:46:04.319
Did you marry him?

1021
00:46:04.450 --> 00:46:07.366
Yes, and I was miserable.

1022
00:46:07.540 --> 00:46:10.152
He had everything
I thought I wanted


1023
00:46:10.326 --> 00:46:12.371
but nothing I truly needed.

1024
00:46:12.545 --> 00:46:13.895
Affection.

1025
00:46:14.069 --> 00:46:15.810
Acceptance. Forgiveness.

1026
00:46:15.984 --> 00:46:17.064
And a heck of a lot of fun.

1027
00:46:18.682 --> 00:46:20.205
Oh, I'm sorry, Rebecca.

1028
00:46:20.379 --> 00:46:22.019
I always thought you were
happily married.


1029
00:46:22.077 --> 00:46:23.774
Oh, happily remarried.

1030
00:46:23.948 --> 00:46:26.255
Oh, I ditched the checklist.

1031
00:46:26.429 --> 00:46:28.083
Followed my heart.

1032
00:46:28.257 --> 00:46:29.998
Good luck tonight.

1033
00:46:42.227 --> 00:46:43.620
Kyle, why are we here again?

1034
00:46:43.794 --> 00:46:45.206
I told you, Doctor Carver
invited you


1035
00:46:45.230 --> 00:46:46.841
to the recording
of her new video.


1036
00:46:47.015 --> 00:46:48.015
But why me?

1037
00:46:48.146 --> 00:46:49.495
Well, she...

1038
00:46:49.669 --> 00:46:50.995
It's Doctor Carver's way
of apologizing


1039
00:46:51.019 --> 00:46:51.802
for how Ryan acted
the other night.


1040
00:46:51.976 --> 00:46:53.021
Exactly.

1041
00:46:53.195 --> 00:46:54.413
I don't even know the woman.

1042
00:46:54.587 --> 00:46:56.981
Well, she knows that you...

1043
00:46:57.155 --> 00:46:58.809
She found you on Ryan's
social media.


1044
00:46:58.983 --> 00:47:00.724
Exactly.

1045
00:47:00.898 --> 00:47:02.484
And as a woman she knows
what it's like to be with a guy


1046
00:47:02.508 --> 00:47:04.008
who thinks he knows
absolutely everything.


1047
00:47:04.032 --> 00:47:05.163
Exactly.

1048
00:47:05.337 --> 00:47:06.904
Come on, we're gonna be late.

1049
00:47:12.170 --> 00:47:13.170
- Hey there.
- Hey.


1050
00:47:13.215 --> 00:47:14.259
She's here, Taylor.

1051
00:47:14.433 --> 00:47:16.827
Great. I've been practicing.

1052
00:47:17.001 --> 00:47:18.437
Perfect.

1053
00:47:18.611 --> 00:47:20.011
About the script.
I didn't know...


1054
00:47:20.091 --> 00:47:21.397
Yeah, Vince gave it to me.

1055
00:47:21.571 --> 00:47:23.181
I thought we'd just wing it,
you know?


1056
00:47:23.355 --> 00:47:24.574
Let our natural charm flow.

1057
00:47:24.748 --> 00:47:26.028
They don't want any surprises.

1058
00:47:26.184 --> 00:47:27.925
The surprise is how
lame this is.


1059
00:47:28.099 --> 00:47:31.102
Come on, what happened
to our witty repartee?


1060
00:47:31.276 --> 00:47:32.930
He means well, 
I know though.

1061
00:47:33.104 --> 00:47:35.193
We should go.
Your tracker.


1062
00:47:35.367 --> 00:47:36.499
Thank you.

1063
00:47:59.087 --> 00:48:02.438
So, yes. It's official.
I am doing the test.


1064
00:48:02.612 --> 00:48:04.222
And while I've
never participated


1065
00:48:04.396 --> 00:48:08.052
in one of my own studies before,
I have to say it's been,


1066
00:48:08.226 --> 00:48:09.837
well, interesting.

1067
00:48:10.011 --> 00:48:11.795
But what's really been
interesting is


1068
00:48:11.969 --> 00:48:14.450
who I'm doing the test with.

1069
00:48:14.624 --> 00:48:17.845
You may recognize
my study participant.


1070
00:48:18.019 --> 00:48:20.108
Veterinarian from
Jolly Rovers Rescue,


1071
00:48:20.282 --> 00:48:22.545
Doctor Ryan Bennett.

1072
00:48:22.719 --> 00:48:24.068
Hello, Doctor Carver.

1073
00:48:24.242 --> 00:48:25.853
Hello Doctor Bennett.

1074
00:48:26.027 --> 00:48:29.944
Yes, it has been interesting
"dating" you.


1075
00:48:30.118 --> 00:48:34.557
Yes, indeed. You were a real
thorn in my side that night.


1076
00:48:34.731 --> 00:48:36.820
And now every night
I'm at your side.


1077
00:48:38.691 --> 00:48:40.476
I wrote that.

1078
00:48:40.650 --> 00:48:42.173
You certainly are.

1079
00:48:42.347 --> 00:48:44.175
We just have to survive
one more date, to...


1080
00:48:44.349 --> 00:48:46.308
So, what's been your favorite
date so far?


1081
00:48:46.482 --> 00:48:47.482
Oh, um...

1082
00:48:50.051 --> 00:48:51.313
Hm?

1083
00:48:51.704 --> 00:48:52.943
How about the time
when we went bowling?


1084
00:48:52.967 --> 00:48:54.272
Uh...

1085
00:48:54.446 --> 00:48:56.187
Yeah. She's the only person
I know


1086
00:48:56.361 --> 00:48:58.798
who can turn bowling
into a contact sport.


1087
00:48:59.887 --> 00:49:01.018
Good one.

1088
00:49:01.671 --> 00:49:02.991
Oh, what about our dancing date?

1089
00:49:03.107 --> 00:49:05.240
Last time I wear
open-toe heels with him.


1090
00:49:05.414 --> 00:49:08.808
And don't ever agree to help him
treat a choking dog.


1091
00:49:08.983 --> 00:49:10.419
I told you to stand back.

1092
00:49:10.593 --> 00:49:12.393
He pushed on that dog's
stomach, and whoosh,


1093
00:49:12.551 --> 00:49:15.206
this slobbery thing shoots right
past my face and nearly hits me.


1094
00:49:15.380 --> 00:49:17.271
Well, that's a small price
to pay for saving a life.


1095
00:49:17.295 --> 00:49:18.775
Oh, easy for him to say.

1096
00:49:18.949 --> 00:49:20.342
He wasn't covered in dog drool.

1097
00:49:20.516 --> 00:49:24.868
Oh, well. We did have our
romantic moments.


1098
00:49:25.042 --> 00:49:27.349
Oh, really?
Where was I?


1099
00:49:27.523 --> 00:49:28.916
Out on the dance floor when...

1100
00:49:29.090 --> 00:49:31.831
I remember seeing stars
in your eyes.


1101
00:49:32.006 --> 00:49:33.790
From you stepping on me.

1102
00:49:33.964 --> 00:49:35.835
They're going off script.
Ad-libbing.


1103
00:49:36.010 --> 00:49:37.794
I know. Isn't it great?

1104
00:49:37.968 --> 00:49:39.970
Ok, well, I admit
that I felt something.


1105
00:49:40.144 --> 00:49:42.581
Yeah, I always used to laugh
at my friends


1106
00:49:42.755 --> 00:49:46.542
who would tell me about this
feeling, this warm glow they got


1107
00:49:46.716 --> 00:49:49.197
when they slowly get to know
somebody, but...


1108
00:49:49.371 --> 00:49:50.371
It's true.

1109
00:49:50.415 --> 00:49:52.809
It's the best feeling.

1110
00:49:52.983 --> 00:49:58.902
It's like this heavy blanket
on a cold morning.


1111
00:49:59.076 --> 00:50:04.125
It's warm and safe and you just
don't want to be anywhere else.


1112
00:50:04.299 --> 00:50:10.218
Just feels right and easy
and a little scary.


1113
00:50:13.743 --> 00:50:16.441
But not as scary as her bowling.

1114
00:50:16.615 --> 00:50:18.487
Or as painful as his dancing.

1115
00:50:18.661 --> 00:50:19.705
Mm.

1116
00:50:25.059 --> 00:50:26.712
Brooke...

1117
00:50:26.886 --> 00:50:28.081
Now, I'll admit, some of that
was actually quite funny


1118
00:50:28.105 --> 00:50:29.846
and at times even touching,

1119
00:50:30.020 --> 00:50:31.935
but I thought we agreed
to stick to the script?


1120
00:50:32.109 --> 00:50:34.938
And I admire someone
who takes chances.


1121
00:50:35.112 --> 00:50:39.029
Oh, well, um, well, it was
pretty funny, choking dog.


1122
00:50:42.641 --> 00:50:44.861
I'm sorry, Rebecca.
I just got caught up and...


1123
00:50:45.035 --> 00:50:48.038
No need for apologies.
Good on you for taking a risk.


1124
00:50:48.212 --> 00:50:51.476
It's a quality I'll be looking
for in the next psychology dean.


1125
00:50:51.650 --> 00:50:53.478
And I know this wasn't part
of the plan,


1126
00:50:53.652 --> 00:50:56.264
but you two make a really
great couple.


1127
00:50:56.438 --> 00:50:59.267
Oh. Mm-mm.

1128
00:50:59.441 --> 00:51:01.051
I just...

1129
00:51:04.576 --> 00:51:07.362
Hey.

1130
00:51:07.536 --> 00:51:10.452
Sophie said that you did this
for me?


1131
00:51:10.626 --> 00:51:13.803
I did. Surprised?

1132
00:51:13.977 --> 00:51:15.346
Only that you wanted me
to watch you flirt


1133
00:51:15.370 --> 00:51:16.936
with a pretty professor.

1134
00:51:17.111 --> 00:51:18.329
Flirt? No. No, no.

1135
00:51:18.503 --> 00:51:20.331
That... that was,
that was an act.


1136
00:51:20.505 --> 00:51:23.030
Could have fooled me.

1137
00:51:23.204 --> 00:51:24.727
I was doing this to,

1138
00:51:24.901 --> 00:51:26.661
you know, show you that
I'm taking it seriously.


1139
00:51:26.685 --> 00:51:27.512
You know, impress you.

1140
00:51:27.686 --> 00:51:29.079
You want to impress me?

1141
00:51:29.253 --> 00:51:29.949
Go back to your private practice
with Kyle.


1142
00:51:30.124 --> 00:51:31.516
Taylor.

1143
00:51:31.690 --> 00:51:33.301
Ryan. I really think
it's about time


1144
00:51:33.475 --> 00:51:35.955
that you give up this whole
dog adoption thing.


1145
00:51:36.130 --> 00:51:38.480
This dog adoption thing
is my life's dream.


1146
00:51:38.654 --> 00:51:42.658
Can't it be more,
you know, a hobby?


1147
00:51:47.750 --> 00:51:51.710
Have we always been this far
apart in what we want in life?


1148
00:51:56.498 --> 00:51:59.849
Yeah. You just couldn't see it.

1149
00:52:00.023 --> 00:52:02.504
That fireball you felt
when we met,


1150
00:52:02.678 --> 00:52:06.812
it took time for the smoke
to clear.


1151
00:52:06.986 --> 00:52:09.685
Goodbye, Ryan.

1152
00:52:17.214 --> 00:52:20.261
Hey, was she surprised?

1153
00:52:20.435 --> 00:52:21.827
Uh, yes.

1154
00:52:22.001 --> 00:52:23.394
So, the plan worked?

1155
00:52:23.568 --> 00:52:25.222
Yes, you were,
you were really great.


1156
00:52:25.396 --> 00:52:27.833
You were very, very convincing.

1157
00:52:28.007 --> 00:52:29.531
Well, I mean, you too.

1158
00:52:29.705 --> 00:52:31.505
I mean, the look on your face
when you went on


1159
00:52:31.576 --> 00:52:35.014
about our moment on the dance
floor was Oscar worthy.


1160
00:52:35.189 --> 00:52:36.625
Yeah.

1161
00:52:38.540 --> 00:52:41.978
- What?
- Nothing.


1162
00:52:42.152 --> 00:52:45.416
Well, good night then.
And again, great acting job.


1163
00:52:45.590 --> 00:52:49.855
Thank you. You too.
Oh, you forgot about the...


1164
00:52:50.029 --> 00:52:52.945
Oh! Right.
Well, I'll save it.


1165
00:52:53.120 --> 00:52:54.904
In case you guys break up again.

1166
00:52:55.078 --> 00:52:57.298
Smart.

1167
00:52:57.472 --> 00:52:59.343
Well, good night.

1168
00:52:59.517 --> 00:53:01.128
Good night.

1169
00:53:15.403 --> 00:53:18.319
It's true.
It's, it's the best feeling.


1170
00:53:18.493 --> 00:53:24.542
It's like this heavy blanket
on a cold morning.


1171
00:53:24.716 --> 00:53:30.244
It's warm and safe and you just
don't want to be anywhere else.


1172
00:53:30.418 --> 00:53:35.118
This feels, feels right,
and easy.


1173
00:53:39.731 --> 00:53:42.212
Get it together, Brooke.

1174
00:53:42.386 --> 00:53:43.866
Eye on the prize, girl.

1175
00:53:44.040 --> 00:53:46.173
You're only doing this
for damage control.


1176
00:53:46.347 --> 00:53:48.392
Not to find your...

1177
00:53:55.573 --> 00:53:58.141
I can't even convince myself.

1178
00:54:09.196 --> 00:54:10.936
How's that?
You in pain, girl?


1179
00:54:11.110 --> 00:54:12.416
She's been walking fine.

1180
00:54:12.590 --> 00:54:14.113
I think she's good to go.

1181
00:54:14.288 --> 00:54:15.613
Can I put her on
the adoption list?


1182
00:54:15.637 --> 00:54:17.160
Yep, she's ready.

1183
00:54:17.334 --> 00:54:18.814
Oh, you hear that, Molly?

1184
00:54:18.988 --> 00:54:20.294
You're gonna have a new home.

1185
00:54:20.468 --> 00:54:22.383
Yeah. Probably sooner
than later.


1186
00:54:22.557 --> 00:54:24.515
I'm gonna miss you, Molly.

1187
00:54:27.997 --> 00:54:30.347
Jen, you mind
closing up tonight?


1188
00:54:30.521 --> 00:54:32.828
Sure, Doctor Bennett.
Going out with Taylor?


1189
00:54:33.002 --> 00:54:37.136
Nope. We broke up, actually.
For good this time.


1190
00:54:37.311 --> 00:54:38.529
I'm sorry.

1191
00:54:38.703 --> 00:54:40.183
Thanks, but she was never
on board


1192
00:54:40.357 --> 00:54:41.717
with this whole
dog adoption thing.


1193
00:54:41.793 --> 00:54:44.579
I see. What does
Doctor Carver think?


1194
00:54:44.753 --> 00:54:46.102
Brooke?

1195
00:54:46.276 --> 00:54:47.843
Yeah, yeah.
She's on board with it.


1196
00:54:48.017 --> 00:54:49.937
It's actually one of the things
we had in common.


1197
00:54:50.106 --> 00:54:51.499
Both in our dream jobs.

1198
00:54:51.673 --> 00:54:53.327
I don't mean to pry,
Doctor Bennett,


1199
00:54:53.501 --> 00:54:56.547
but seeing you and Doctor
Carver in that new video...


1200
00:54:56.721 --> 00:54:58.161
The one from last night?
That's up?


1201
00:54:58.288 --> 00:55:01.160
Mm-hm. You two
are so cute together.


1202
00:55:01.335 --> 00:55:03.119
Maybe things will work out
with her?


1203
00:55:03.293 --> 00:55:06.253
Doubtful. This is our
last date, tonight.


1204
00:55:06.427 --> 00:55:08.037
But thank you.

1205
00:55:08.211 --> 00:55:10.213
Mm-hm.

1206
00:55:20.528 --> 00:55:24.053
So, this is it.
Our romantic date.


1207
00:55:24.227 --> 00:55:25.750
Oh, I can tell.

1208
00:55:25.924 --> 00:55:29.058
Candlelight, white table cloth,
overpriced wine.


1209
00:55:29.232 --> 00:55:31.408
Hey, all this romance
doesn't come cheap.


1210
00:55:31.582 --> 00:55:32.931
Not for you at all.

1211
00:55:33.105 --> 00:55:34.455
Not true.

1212
00:55:34.629 --> 00:55:36.892
I do believe that people
feel something


1213
00:55:37.066 --> 00:55:38.807
that they call romance.

1214
00:55:38.981 --> 00:55:40.287
And you call?

1215
00:55:40.461 --> 00:55:42.114
A rush of feel good
neurochemicals


1216
00:55:42.289 --> 00:55:43.962
that flood the brain,
producing a wave of euphoria.


1217
00:55:43.986 --> 00:55:45.770
Hm. You know what?

1218
00:55:45.944 --> 00:55:48.140
I think I'll just stick with
good old-fashioned romance.


1219
00:55:48.164 --> 00:55:51.298
Suit yourself. Did you bring
the gift?


1220
00:55:51.472 --> 00:55:52.472
You?

1221
00:55:55.127 --> 00:55:56.128
You first.

1222
00:56:08.010 --> 00:56:10.012
As long as you're dancing
nothing can hurt you.


1223
00:56:10.186 --> 00:56:12.231
Aw. Just what I wanted.
Dance lessons.


1224
00:56:12.406 --> 00:56:13.755
For the man who has everything.

1225
00:56:13.929 --> 00:56:16.323
Including two left feet.

1226
00:56:19.021 --> 00:56:21.153
You're not, you know, offended?

1227
00:56:21.328 --> 00:56:24.243
Not at all.
No, thank you.


1228
00:56:27.159 --> 00:56:31.947
I'll think about you every time
I step on my partner's toes.


1229
00:56:34.297 --> 00:56:36.952
Ok. Your turn.

1230
00:56:40.303 --> 00:56:43.437
Oh, it's very light.
It's definitely not a book.


1231
00:56:43.611 --> 00:56:45.090
No, I saw your office.

1232
00:56:45.264 --> 00:56:48.093
You have more books
than a school library.


1233
00:56:48.267 --> 00:56:49.268
Well, it's not jewelry.

1234
00:56:49.443 --> 00:56:51.358
That's far too romantic.

1235
00:56:51.532 --> 00:56:55.013
Hate to see you hit by a rogue
wave of neurochemicals.


1236
00:56:55.187 --> 00:56:57.799
Ah, well... I'll...

1237
00:56:57.973 --> 00:56:59.017
Just open it.

1238
00:56:59.191 --> 00:57:00.584
Ok. Ok.

1239
00:57:04.109 --> 00:57:07.112
Screech!

1240
00:57:07.286 --> 00:57:08.287
Hope it's ok.

1241
00:57:08.462 --> 00:57:10.115
It's perfect.

1242
00:57:10.289 --> 00:57:12.509
It's just like the one I had
when I was growing up.


1243
00:57:14.337 --> 00:57:18.515
And just as cuddly.
Thank you.


1244
00:57:20.212 --> 00:57:21.388
You're very welcome.

1245
00:57:21.953 --> 00:57:22.998
Um.

1246
00:57:45.368 --> 00:57:47.370
So, our last date.

1247
00:57:47.544 --> 00:57:48.980
It is.

1248
00:57:49.154 --> 00:57:51.940
Is there a formal way
to end the study?


1249
00:57:52.114 --> 00:57:56.945
You know, say goodbye.
It's been fun, keep in touch.


1250
00:57:57.119 --> 00:57:59.426
You know, catch you
on the flip side.


1251
00:57:59.600 --> 00:58:01.055
I don't think anybody says
that anymore.


1252
00:58:01.079 --> 00:58:02.907
- I say that.
- Ok.


1253
00:58:03.081 --> 00:58:04.822
Hey, what if uh...

1254
00:58:04.996 --> 00:58:06.781
What?

1255
00:58:06.955 --> 00:58:10.828
What if I wanted to have,
I don't know, one more date?


1256
00:58:11.002 --> 00:58:13.178
To show Taylor
that this is something


1257
00:58:13.352 --> 00:58:15.790
you're really invested in?

1258
00:58:15.964 --> 00:58:18.270
Uh.

1259
00:58:18.445 --> 00:58:19.968
I'd do another date.

1260
00:58:20.142 --> 00:58:21.752
Me too.

1261
00:58:21.926 --> 00:58:23.841
I mean, we could go on
one of the bonus dates.


1262
00:58:24.015 --> 00:58:25.321
Bonus dates?

1263
00:58:25.495 --> 00:58:26.815
It's in your folder.
Appendix B.


1264
00:58:26.975 --> 00:58:30.457
There's an artsy date,
an exercise date,


1265
00:58:30.631 --> 00:58:31.762
a new-experiences date.

1266
00:58:31.936 --> 00:58:33.851
Yeah. What's that?

1267
00:58:34.025 --> 00:58:36.898
It's something neither of us
has done before.


1268
00:58:37.072 --> 00:58:39.117
So, one more date.

1269
00:58:39.291 --> 00:58:42.077
One more date.

1270
00:58:43.948 --> 00:58:47.778
It had to be you

1271
00:58:47.952 --> 00:58:51.869
It had to be you

1272
00:58:52.043 --> 00:58:59.877
I wandered around and
finally found somebody who...


1273
00:59:00.051 --> 00:59:01.313
You're singing.

1274
00:59:01.488 --> 00:59:02.924
Oh, sorry, was I
interrupting you?


1275
00:59:03.098 --> 00:59:04.882
No, no. It's great.

1276
00:59:05.056 --> 00:59:06.144
Ok.

1277
00:59:06.318 --> 00:59:07.885
You are really happy lately.

1278
00:59:08.059 --> 00:59:09.899
Happier than I've seen you
in a very long time.


1279
00:59:09.974 --> 00:59:11.759
Carly, I know where
you're going with this


1280
00:59:11.933 --> 00:59:14.892
and it has nothing to do
with Ryan.


1281
00:59:15.066 --> 00:59:15.893
- Really?
- Mm-Hm.


1282
00:59:16.067 --> 00:59:17.155
Hmm.

1283
00:59:19.027 --> 00:59:22.421
Wow. You're up to six.

1284
00:59:22.596 --> 00:59:24.293
So much for one more date.

1285
00:59:24.467 --> 00:59:26.904
Now the study has more
variables to ascertain.


1286
00:59:27.078 --> 00:59:28.819
Oh, Brooke. Would you listen
to yourself?


1287
00:59:28.993 --> 00:59:31.213
Human emotions do not compute.

1288
00:59:31.387 --> 00:59:33.955
I am equipped with
a data-driven heart.


1289
00:59:34.129 --> 00:59:36.174
Boop-boop. Boop-boop.

1290
00:59:36.348 --> 00:59:37.785
Are you finished?

1291
00:59:37.959 --> 00:59:38.959
Boop.

1292
00:59:40.744 --> 00:59:44.400
It's obvious.
You've fallen for him.


1293
00:59:44.574 --> 00:59:45.967
What? No.

1294
00:59:46.141 --> 00:59:48.186
He is your screen saver.

1295
00:59:48.360 --> 00:59:49.927
Agh-agh, no.

1296
00:59:50.101 --> 00:59:52.800
We saw an old photo booth
at the bowling alley.


1297
00:59:52.974 --> 00:59:54.323
Huh. Cute stuffed toy.

1298
00:59:54.497 --> 00:59:55.846
We had a gift giving date.

1299
00:59:56.020 --> 00:59:57.020
Flowers?

1300
00:59:57.108 --> 00:59:58.806
I bought those.

1301
00:59:58.980 --> 01:00:01.132
Still, two out of three.
Better than my average lately.


1302
01:00:01.156 --> 01:00:02.940
Your dates?

1303
01:00:03.114 --> 01:00:04.396
What, the three-question thing
isn't working out for you?


1304
01:00:04.420 --> 01:00:06.509
Ugh. Train wreck.
Every guy.


1305
01:00:06.683 --> 01:00:08.119
Oh, I'm sorry.

1306
01:00:08.293 --> 01:00:09.904
Like I ask one guy,
name a cheesy song.


1307
01:00:10.078 --> 01:00:12.907
He goes "I don't know
any songs about cheese."


1308
01:00:13.081 --> 01:00:14.473
Think that's bad?

1309
01:00:14.648 --> 01:00:16.954
Two guys said that their
ideal dinner guest


1310
01:00:17.128 --> 01:00:18.347
would be Kim Kardashian.

1311
01:00:18.521 --> 01:00:20.001
Oh, gosh.

1312
01:00:20.175 --> 01:00:22.220
Should have just skipped
the third question.


1313
01:00:22.394 --> 01:00:25.006
What's the most beautiful view
you've ever seen.


1314
01:00:25.180 --> 01:00:26.834
Wait, don't tell me.

1315
01:00:27.008 --> 01:00:28.357
Kim Kardashian.

1316
01:00:28.531 --> 01:00:31.360
So, no poetry and sappy
love songs.


1317
01:00:31.534 --> 01:00:33.188
The last guy scored
negative seven.


1318
01:00:33.362 --> 01:00:35.016
I'm so sorry, Carly.

1319
01:00:35.190 --> 01:00:38.846
Whatever. But you two clearly
have something going on.


1320
01:00:39.020 --> 01:00:40.935
Your scores are in the 90's.

1321
01:00:41.109 --> 01:00:42.632
The study's goal is 95.

1322
01:00:42.806 --> 01:00:47.332
But how did he score
where it counts? Here.


1323
01:00:47.506 --> 01:00:48.986
The study doesn't have
a protocol.


1324
01:00:49.160 --> 01:00:51.249
Oh, and the robot is back.

1325
01:00:51.423 --> 01:00:53.338
Oh, ok. You're right.

1326
01:00:53.512 --> 01:00:58.561
Ryan is great and funny and
charming and kind of sweet.


1327
01:00:58.735 --> 01:01:00.215
I knew it.

1328
01:01:00.389 --> 01:01:02.260
Who's trying to get back
with his girlfriend.


1329
01:01:02.434 --> 01:01:03.871
By going on more dates with you?

1330
01:01:04.045 --> 01:01:05.481
To show her he's invested.

1331
01:01:05.655 --> 01:01:07.962
Look, ok, I have seen you
with Logan,


1332
01:01:08.136 --> 01:01:09.877
with Landon, with Lucas...

1333
01:01:10.051 --> 01:01:11.226
There was no Lucas!

1334
01:01:11.400 --> 01:01:13.228
And now I've seen you with Ryan

1335
01:01:13.402 --> 01:01:15.926
and I've never seen you
so happy.


1336
01:01:16.100 --> 01:01:19.974
I mean, you are singing.

1337
01:01:20.148 --> 01:01:22.063
Ok, but the thing is Carly,

1338
01:01:22.237 --> 01:01:25.066
I was happy with Logan
and Landon


1339
01:01:25.240 --> 01:01:27.459
and pretty much every guy
I've ever dated


1340
01:01:27.634 --> 01:01:30.419
but I can't expose
my heart again


1341
01:01:30.593 --> 01:01:34.031
and watch it crumble
into a sad pile of rubble.


1342
01:01:34.205 --> 01:01:39.123
Ok. I'll let it go.
For now.


1343
01:01:39.297 --> 01:01:43.040
Look, we have one more date,
this Saturday night


1344
01:01:43.214 --> 01:01:45.477
and then I will thank him
for doing the dating test


1345
01:01:45.652 --> 01:01:50.961
and say bye and never
see him again.


1346
01:01:51.135 --> 01:01:53.094
Except on your screen saver.

1347
01:01:53.268 --> 01:01:55.749
Oh, right. I'll delete that.

1348
01:02:09.980 --> 01:02:12.113
Ready for a new experience?

1349
01:02:12.287 --> 01:02:13.418
Ok.

1350
01:02:18.685 --> 01:02:20.077
Are you sure about this?

1351
01:02:20.251 --> 01:02:21.402
Yes. Neither of us
have baked before.


1352
01:02:21.426 --> 01:02:22.993
This is gonna be fun.

1353
01:02:23.167 --> 01:02:24.887
Hm. You said the same thing
about bowling.


1354
01:02:25.039 --> 01:02:26.823
So, what are we making?

1355
01:02:26.997 --> 01:02:28.956
You like chocolate?

1356
01:02:29.130 --> 01:02:30.914
Of course.

1357
01:02:31.088 --> 01:02:33.568
In fact, studies show that nine
out of 10 women like chocolate.


1358
01:02:33.656 --> 01:02:34.962
The tenth is lying.

1359
01:02:35.136 --> 01:02:39.140
Oh, buh-dum-ching.

1360
01:02:39.314 --> 01:02:42.012
Ok, so. Chocolate what?
Mousse?


1361
01:02:42.186 --> 01:02:44.362
Oh la la. You do set
the bar high.


1362
01:02:44.536 --> 01:02:45.842
Cake?

1363
01:02:46.016 --> 01:02:47.844
Hm. That requires layers.
Lower.


1364
01:02:48.018 --> 01:02:49.018
Brownies?

1365
01:02:49.106 --> 01:02:50.978
Lower.

1366
01:02:51.152 --> 01:02:53.260
If we go any lower we'll be
licking batter off our fingers.


1367
01:02:53.284 --> 01:02:56.897
Well that does sound weirdly
appealing, but no.


1368
01:02:57.071 --> 01:03:00.814
How do triple threat chocolate
fudge cookies sound?


1369
01:03:00.988 --> 01:03:02.511
Threatening.
What's in 'em?


1370
01:03:02.685 --> 01:03:05.035
Dark chocolate chips,
white chocolate chips,


1371
01:03:05.209 --> 01:03:07.951
chocolate covered walnuts
with a chocolate drizzle.


1372
01:03:08.125 --> 01:03:09.845
That would actually be
a quadruple threat.


1373
01:03:09.997 --> 01:03:12.216
Wow, only you would count.

1374
01:03:12.390 --> 01:03:13.696
So, where's the recipe?

1375
01:03:13.870 --> 01:03:17.004
No recipe. It's gonna
be an adventure.


1376
01:03:17.178 --> 01:03:19.963
It'll be inedible.
We need a recipe.


1377
01:03:23.488 --> 01:03:24.488
Ok, come on.

1378
01:03:24.576 --> 01:03:26.056
Let's cook from here.

1379
01:03:26.230 --> 01:03:28.842
Romantic but not practical.
We need a recipe.


1380
01:03:29.016 --> 01:03:32.933
Brooke, where is your
adventurous spirit?


1381
01:03:33.107 --> 01:03:35.500
Ok then.

1382
01:03:35.674 --> 01:03:36.937
Let the fun begin.

1383
01:03:37.111 --> 01:03:40.984
Ok. That's the spirit.

1384
01:04:35.952 --> 01:04:39.913
Ok. Moment of truth?

1385
01:04:40.087 --> 01:04:41.915
Please. Ladies first.

1386
01:04:42.089 --> 01:04:45.832
You're either very chivalrous
or very cowardly.


1387
01:04:46.006 --> 01:04:47.529
Let's try them at the same time.

1388
01:04:47.703 --> 01:04:49.226
Ok.

1389
01:04:59.106 --> 01:05:00.803
That's not bad.

1390
01:05:00.977 --> 01:05:02.259
Not bad at all, considering
we didn't use a recipe.


1391
01:05:02.283 --> 01:05:04.111
Well, you see?

1392
01:05:04.285 --> 01:05:06.156
Is this your "I told you so"
moment?


1393
01:05:06.330 --> 01:05:09.899
No, this just shows that you
can use this instead of this.


1394
01:05:10.073 --> 01:05:12.815
I'd rather use this.

1395
01:05:12.989 --> 01:05:14.512
I'm just saying that, you know,

1396
01:05:14.686 --> 01:05:17.124
not everything needs to be
measured and quantified.


1397
01:05:17.298 --> 01:05:19.300
Definitely an "I told you so"
moment.


1398
01:05:19.474 --> 01:05:21.780
Bottom line, these are great.

1399
01:05:21.955 --> 01:05:23.347
Hmm. Perfect.

1400
01:05:26.350 --> 01:05:31.225
Uh, speaking of which, you
never answered question 11.


1401
01:05:31.399 --> 01:05:33.314
Describe a perfect day
you've had.


1402
01:05:33.488 --> 01:05:37.144
Ah, well, lately that would
be every day.


1403
01:05:37.318 --> 01:05:38.972
How so?

1404
01:05:39.146 --> 01:05:42.845
Rather than tell you,
why don't I show you?


1405
01:05:43.019 --> 01:05:44.019
Ah what, now?

1406
01:05:44.151 --> 01:05:46.196
Yeah. Yeah. Right now.

1407
01:05:46.370 --> 01:05:48.851
Ok. Can I bring the cookies?

1408
01:05:49.025 --> 01:05:50.548
- Sure.
- Ok.


1409
01:05:51.027 --> 01:05:52.986
As long as you're willing
to share.


1410
01:06:04.040 --> 01:06:05.781
My perfect day would start here.

1411
01:06:05.955 --> 01:06:06.956
At work?

1412
01:06:07.130 --> 01:06:09.393
Well, it's not work to me.

1413
01:06:09.567 --> 01:06:11.047
Do I get the full tour
this time?


1414
01:06:11.221 --> 01:06:13.310
Sure. Gonna leave
the cookies here though.


1415
01:06:13.484 --> 01:06:14.484
Oh.

1416
01:06:16.226 --> 01:06:19.012
Ok. Let's go.

1417
01:06:20.230 --> 01:06:24.756
And over here, these are
all of our dogs.


1418
01:06:24.931 --> 01:06:25.932
I could adopt them all.

1419
01:06:26.106 --> 01:06:27.716
Well, that can be arranged.

1420
01:06:29.718 --> 01:06:33.765
Oh! Here's a cutie! Hello.

1421
01:06:33.940 --> 01:06:35.854
Molly, this is Brooke.

1422
01:06:36.029 --> 01:06:37.769
Hi Molly.

1423
01:06:41.425 --> 01:06:42.557
Oh, she says hi.

1424
01:06:42.731 --> 01:06:44.124
Oh, what a smart dog.

1425
01:06:44.298 --> 01:06:45.995
She says "adopt me."

1426
01:06:46.169 --> 01:06:49.825
Aww. I wish.
But if I ever do...


1427
01:06:49.999 --> 01:06:50.826
- Uh-oh.
- Hello!


1428
01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:52.175
Someone's jealous.

1429
01:06:52.349 --> 01:06:53.829
Oh! Hi.

1430
01:06:54.003 --> 01:06:55.309
This is Max, my dog.

1431
01:06:55.483 --> 01:06:59.008
Hello Max!
Oh, you're beautiful too.


1432
01:06:59.182 --> 01:07:01.222
What do you think,
should we take them for a walk?


1433
01:07:03.056 --> 01:07:04.405
That's a yes.

1434
01:07:06.189 --> 01:07:07.189
Yes.

1435
01:07:11.281 --> 01:07:13.283
So, how did I score on the test?

1436
01:07:13.457 --> 01:07:17.896
Thursday night I am giving
a speech to release the study


1437
01:07:18.071 --> 01:07:19.855
and I'll reveal the scores.

1438
01:07:20.029 --> 01:07:22.336
Hm. How did I do?

1439
01:07:22.510 --> 01:07:24.164
Oh, you've been replaced.

1440
01:07:27.645 --> 01:07:28.645
Good choice.

1441
01:07:29.996 --> 01:07:31.171
- Oh, oh.
- Hey, Molly.


1442
01:07:31.345 --> 01:07:32.476
Come here.

1443
01:07:35.436 --> 01:07:37.046
Molly come here.

1444
01:07:40.006 --> 01:07:41.442
Well, that works.

1445
01:07:44.271 --> 01:07:47.839
Well, admit it, you're in love.

1446
01:07:48.014 --> 01:07:49.450
Ryan, I...

1447
01:07:49.624 --> 01:07:51.843
With Molly.

1448
01:07:52.018 --> 01:07:55.238
I mean, she is definitely
in love with you.


1449
01:07:55.412 --> 01:07:58.372
Oh, and how do you know that?

1450
01:07:58.546 --> 01:08:00.156
Doctor Bennett?

1451
01:08:00.330 --> 01:08:03.768
Well, the way she looks at you.
I mean, checking on you.


1452
01:08:03.942 --> 01:08:05.292
With those eyes.

1453
01:08:05.466 --> 01:08:08.338
She's up for adoption,
just saying.


1454
01:08:08.512 --> 01:08:10.645
I'll keep that in mind.

1455
01:08:11.385 --> 01:08:12.905
So, what about people,
Doctor Carver,


1456
01:08:12.951 --> 01:08:14.910
how do you tell
when they're in love?


1457
01:08:15.084 --> 01:08:17.086
Well, you know, the usual.

1458
01:08:17.259 --> 01:08:20.611
Just dilated pupils,
racing heart, sweaty palms.


1459
01:08:26.530 --> 01:08:30.794
I should get these guys inside.
Come on, let's go!


1460
01:08:30.969 --> 01:08:33.972
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

1461
01:08:48.552 --> 01:08:51.250
So, that was my perfect day.

1462
01:08:51.425 --> 01:08:53.991
Thank you for sharing it
with me.


1463
01:08:54.167 --> 01:08:56.081
My pleasure.

1464
01:08:58.170 --> 01:09:00.869
So, I was reading Appendix B

1465
01:09:01.043 --> 01:09:04.177
and it says that this was our
last bonus date.


1466
01:09:04.351 --> 01:09:08.746
Yes, it is.
Oh, no. Um...


1467
01:09:08.919 --> 01:09:10.269
What?

1468
01:09:10.444 --> 01:09:12.124
Oh no, it's a...
it's a big day tomorrow.


1469
01:09:12.272 --> 01:09:14.535
I just, I'm polishing the script
and rehearsing all day.


1470
01:09:14.709 --> 01:09:16.189
I can help you rehearse
if you want.


1471
01:09:16.363 --> 01:09:20.018
Yeah. Thanks, thanks.
But it's... I should go.


1472
01:09:20.193 --> 01:09:21.759
Right.

1473
01:09:21.933 --> 01:09:27.330
Um. It's been great.
It's been really great.


1474
01:09:27.504 --> 01:09:31.552
Thank you for everything.
Give Molly a big hug for me.


1475
01:09:31.726 --> 01:09:33.771
Yeah. I will.

1476
01:09:33.945 --> 01:09:39.080
So, I guess this is goodnight.
And goodbye.


1477
01:09:40.125 --> 01:09:48.045
Yeah. Um, oh.
This is your device.


1478
01:09:48.221 --> 01:09:50.614
Thank you, Doctor Bennett.

1479
01:09:56.011 --> 01:09:57.969
Catch you on the flip side.

1480
01:10:01.059 --> 01:10:03.105
I love it. Great job.

1481
01:10:03.279 --> 01:10:04.846
It's a really nice speech,
Brooke.


1482
01:10:05.020 --> 01:10:07.152
This is gonna be a huge boon
to the university.


1483
01:10:07.327 --> 01:10:08.850
The visibility we'll get
from this.


1484
01:10:09.024 --> 01:10:10.895
I invited local media to cover.

1485
01:10:11.069 --> 01:10:13.109
Now, it's important, Brooke,
that you don't reveal


1486
01:10:13.159 --> 01:10:15.119
the attraction tracker score
until tomorrow night.


1487
01:10:15.291 --> 01:10:16.964
And, please don't tell anyone
the real reason


1488
01:10:16.988 --> 01:10:18.250
you did the test.

1489
01:10:18.425 --> 01:10:19.904
What do we say to people

1490
01:10:20.078 --> 01:10:21.863
when they see they didn't
fall in love?


1491
01:10:22.037 --> 01:10:24.145
Well that can actually lend
some credibility to the study.


1492
01:10:24.169 --> 01:10:25.823
There simply wasn't
much attraction


1493
01:10:25.997 --> 01:10:27.607
between Brooke and Ryan.

1494
01:10:27.782 --> 01:10:30.176
We can't say that.
I mean, look at the scores.


1495
01:10:30.350 --> 01:10:33.353
Well, then maybe there simply
wasn't enough attraction.


1496
01:10:33.527 --> 01:10:35.355
That sound good to you, Brooke?

1497
01:10:35.529 --> 01:10:37.487
Yes, of course.

1498
01:10:37.660 --> 01:10:40.838
I mean, if study participants
don't reach 95


1499
01:10:41.012 --> 01:10:44.059
then it's time to move on.

1500
01:10:56.463 --> 01:10:59.205
Ok. Tell me.

1501
01:10:59.379 --> 01:11:01.163
Kyle, I, I, I told you.

1502
01:11:01.337 --> 01:11:04.253
I signed an 18-page contract
agreeing not to say anything


1503
01:11:04.427 --> 01:11:06.255
until the study is released.

1504
01:11:06.428 --> 01:11:08.668
Come on, you don't need a
score to tell you how you feel.


1505
01:11:08.692 --> 01:11:10.999
Is Brooke the one?

1506
01:11:11.173 --> 01:11:12.173
Kyle.

1507
01:11:12.218 --> 01:11:15.221
Come on. Is she the one?

1508
01:11:17.353 --> 01:11:19.921
Hmm?

1509
01:11:20.095 --> 01:11:23.490
Yes. Yes.

1510
01:11:23.664 --> 01:11:26.101
I knew it! I knew it.

1511
01:11:26.275 --> 01:11:28.843
The way you talked about her, it
was never like this with Taylor.


1512
01:11:29.017 --> 01:11:30.647
Don't say anything, ok.
Not even to Sophie.


1513
01:11:30.671 --> 01:11:33.500
Ok. What about Brooke?
How does she feel?


1514
01:11:33.674 --> 01:11:35.980
I'm not sure.
Not that it matters.


1515
01:11:36.154 --> 01:11:38.853
Of course, it matters.
It's kind of how love works.


1516
01:11:39.027 --> 01:11:40.309
Well not when one of us
has vowed


1517
01:11:40.333 --> 01:11:42.596
never to fall in love again.

1518
01:11:42.770 --> 01:11:43.901
Brooke, right?

1519
01:11:44.075 --> 01:11:46.077
No, me. Yes. Brooke.

1520
01:11:46.252 --> 01:11:47.991
She said she's done with dating.

1521
01:11:48.166 --> 01:11:51.821
Well, that's what Sophie said
and three months later


1522
01:11:51.996 --> 01:11:53.910
we were engaged.

1523
01:11:54.085 --> 01:11:56.000
She's just tired of dealing
with heartbreak.


1524
01:11:56.174 --> 01:11:59.569
Maybe this time
she won't have to.


1525
01:11:59.743 --> 01:12:03.878
Yeah, maybe, but...
she likes numbers, you know?


1526
01:12:04.052 --> 01:12:05.401
Not feelings.

1527
01:12:05.575 --> 01:12:07.360
She wants love plotted out

1528
01:12:07.534 --> 01:12:09.927
like data points on a graph.

1529
01:12:10.101 --> 01:12:11.580
You know what I think?

1530
01:12:11.755 --> 01:12:15.542
I think you should tell her
how you feel.


1531
01:12:15.716 --> 01:12:17.326
I don't know.

1532
01:12:17.500 --> 01:12:20.982
She may be a scientist,
but she still has feelings.


1533
01:12:28.119 --> 01:12:30.010
So, at this point I'm going
to reveal the score.


1534
01:12:30.034 --> 01:12:32.820
So, I'll cross to the stage,

1535
01:12:32.994 --> 01:12:35.475
and behind me will be
a graphics showing...


1536
01:12:37.477 --> 01:12:39.261
Ryan?

1537
01:12:39.435 --> 01:12:42.960
I was told that I might find
you here.


1538
01:12:43.134 --> 01:12:47.095
Lou, can we take a quick break?
Great, thanks.


1539
01:12:51.360 --> 01:12:52.970
Hey, what's up?

1540
01:12:53.143 --> 01:12:55.277
I know you're busy.
I won't be long.


1541
01:12:55.451 --> 01:12:57.845
Oh, it's ok.
What's wrong?


1542
01:12:58.018 --> 01:13:01.109
I've never seen your serious
face before.


1543
01:13:01.283 --> 01:13:02.937
This? Yeah, I know.

1544
01:13:03.111 --> 01:13:06.897
I only bring it out for funerals
and breakup speeches.


1545
01:13:07.071 --> 01:13:08.595
Which is this?

1546
01:13:08.768 --> 01:13:11.162
Neither. Although I did
break up with Taylor.


1547
01:13:11.337 --> 01:13:14.818
Oh. I'm sorry. When?

1548
01:13:14.991 --> 01:13:17.343
Uh, like last week.

1549
01:13:17.517 --> 01:13:19.127
Last week?

1550
01:13:19.301 --> 01:13:21.434
Yes. I should have told you.

1551
01:13:21.607 --> 01:13:23.305
We went on all those
bonus dates.


1552
01:13:23.479 --> 01:13:28.049
I know. I know, and I didn't go
on them to impress Taylor.


1553
01:13:28.223 --> 01:13:31.182
I went on them to-because...

1554
01:13:35.230 --> 01:13:39.930
Well, I think I'm in love
with you.


1555
01:13:40.104 --> 01:13:42.280
What?

1556
01:13:42.455 --> 01:13:46.502
And, so, I'm here you know,

1557
01:13:46.676 --> 01:13:48.982
to see if maybe you feel
the same way.


1558
01:13:49.157 --> 01:13:53.116
Um. What happened
to love at first sight?


1559
01:13:53.291 --> 01:13:55.859
I was wrong.

1560
01:13:56.033 --> 01:13:57.383
When we danced,

1561
01:13:57.557 --> 01:13:59.994
I felt this flicker
and that flame,


1562
01:14:00.168 --> 01:14:01.996
it just seems to grow brighter.

1563
01:14:02.169 --> 01:14:05.782
Every time that I see you.

1564
01:14:05.955 --> 01:14:09.917
Um. Ryan, my big speech
is tomorrow and...


1565
01:14:10.091 --> 01:14:11.527
I know.

1566
01:14:11.701 --> 01:14:12.939
I mean, there's a lot
riding on this.


1567
01:14:12.963 --> 01:14:14.225
Donations, enrollment, ranking.

1568
01:14:14.400 --> 01:14:15.879
The president wants
to make me Dean.


1569
01:14:16.053 --> 01:14:17.925
I just thought...

1570
01:14:18.098 --> 01:14:23.321
Yes, there was some attraction
as reflected in our scores.


1571
01:14:23.496 --> 01:14:25.889
Scores. Stop it.
Stop with the scores.


1572
01:14:26.062 --> 01:14:28.196
Come on. What are,
what are your feelings?


1573
01:14:28.370 --> 01:14:31.329
Feelings. I, I shut those down
a while ago.


1574
01:14:31.504 --> 01:14:36.204
Brooke. I felt something
from you.


1575
01:14:36.378 --> 01:14:39.207
I'm sorry. I, I never should
have let it slip out.


1576
01:14:39.381 --> 01:14:42.428
Slip out, Brooke.
What are you...


1577
01:14:42.602 --> 01:14:46.606
Ryan, I can't do this.
Please just try to understand.


1578
01:14:46.780 --> 01:14:52.263
I, I've had my heart broken
so many times.


1579
01:14:52.437 --> 01:14:57.181
As if I lost part of it,
somewhere along the line.


1580
01:14:57.355 --> 01:14:59.532
I'm sorry.

1581
01:15:10.717 --> 01:15:12.414
And after the three
required dates,


1582
01:15:12.588 --> 01:15:14.982
we decided to try some
bonus dates.


1583
01:15:15.156 --> 01:15:19.421
We visited an art museum,
rode a tandem bike.


1584
01:15:19.595 --> 01:15:23.077
I even learned to bake cookies
without using a recipe.


1585
01:15:23.250 --> 01:15:25.862
A sweet adventure.

1586
01:15:26.035 --> 01:15:29.213
All the while waiting to see
if cupid's arrow would strike.


1587
01:15:29.387 --> 01:15:31.433
Ugh. Enough about cupid.

1588
01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:37.047
All the while waiting to see
if a spark would ignite


1589
01:15:37.221 --> 01:15:40.616
a flame within our hearts.

1590
01:15:41.530 --> 01:15:45.794
Nope, sounds like heartburn.
Blah, blah, blah.


1591
01:15:45.969 --> 01:15:47.971
And now, for the big reveal.

1592
01:15:48.145 --> 01:15:49.545
The question everyone
wants to know.


1593
01:15:49.625 --> 01:15:53.977
Did I fall in love,
find the one?


1594
01:15:58.155 --> 01:15:59.592
There you are.

1595
01:15:59.766 --> 01:16:02.899
Oh. My favorite flower.

1596
01:16:03.073 --> 01:16:04.857
Good. 'Cause there's
a long trail of them


1597
01:16:05.032 --> 01:16:07.164
leading to your office.

1598
01:16:48.466 --> 01:16:50.904
They must be from Ryan.

1599
01:16:51.078 --> 01:16:55.256
Huh. What a funny, charming,
kind of sweet guy.


1600
01:17:11.228 --> 01:17:15.058
Think he still wants to get back
with his girlfriend?


1601
01:17:20.629 --> 01:17:22.848
"Dear Brooke, I want you
to know how much"


1602
01:17:23.023 --> 01:17:25.068
"I enjoyed my time with you."

1603
01:17:27.375 --> 01:17:30.030
"I will truly miss you."

1604
01:17:31.727 --> 01:17:35.991
"Your smile, your adventurous
baking."


1605
01:17:36.166 --> 01:17:38.255
"Your crazy bowling skills."

1606
01:17:42.259 --> 01:17:45.219
"I know you've had your heart
broken one too many times


1607
01:17:45.393 --> 01:17:48.830
"but I hope you don't give
up on finding love.


1608
01:17:49.005 --> 01:17:50.571
"You have a warm,
beautiful heart


1609
01:17:50.746 --> 01:17:53.531
"that deserves to be shared by
some lucky guy.


1610
01:17:53.705 --> 01:17:56.970
"Anyway, please accept
this parting gift"


1611
01:17:57.143 --> 01:17:59.842
"to help make your day
a little more perfect."


1612
01:18:00.016 --> 01:18:02.540
"Your devoted study partner,
Ryan."


1613
01:18:27.348 --> 01:18:28.654
You coming?

1614
01:18:30.437 --> 01:18:31.178
What's going on?

1615
01:18:31.352 --> 01:18:32.745
Ah, not going.

1616
01:18:34.964 --> 01:18:37.924
Isn't Brooke giving the dating
test results in like 20 minutes?


1617
01:18:38.098 --> 01:18:39.490
Yeah, but it doesn't matter.

1618
01:18:39.665 --> 01:18:41.491
The results, they don't
mean anything.


1619
01:18:46.018 --> 01:18:47.890
I mean, I tried.

1620
01:18:48.064 --> 01:18:51.067
I tried to get through to her
but she just,


1621
01:18:51.241 --> 01:18:53.853
she doesn't feel the same way.

1622
01:19:16.963 --> 01:19:19.356
There she is,
looking every bit the star.


1623
01:19:19.530 --> 01:19:20.530
Thanks Rebecca.

1624
01:19:20.575 --> 01:19:21.271
You look great, Brooke.

1625
01:19:21.445 --> 01:19:22.925
Thanks, Vince.

1626
01:19:23.098 --> 01:19:23.926
Uh, Vince, can you give us
a second please?


1627
01:19:24.100 --> 01:19:25.884
Oh, of course. Yeah.

1628
01:19:26.059 --> 01:19:27.645
Brooke, I don't know if you've
had time to think about


1629
01:19:27.669 --> 01:19:29.018
the Dean of Psychology position?

1630
01:19:29.192 --> 01:19:30.846
- I have, yes.
- Oh, good.


1631
01:19:31.020 --> 01:19:32.805
I mean, I can't
say this publicly,


1632
01:19:32.979 --> 01:19:36.112
but you'd be at the top
of my list.


1633
01:19:36.285 --> 01:19:39.812
Thank you, Rebecca,
but I won't be applying.


1634
01:19:39.986 --> 01:19:41.727
What? Why not?

1635
01:19:41.901 --> 01:19:44.338
Being Dean wouldn't leave
enough time for my research.


1636
01:19:44.512 --> 01:19:48.080
It's why I became a scientist.
That's where my heart is.


1637
01:19:48.255 --> 01:19:53.173
Oh, I see. Well, I can't say
I'm not disappointed.


1638
01:19:53.347 --> 01:19:56.219
But, I respect your decision.

1639
01:19:56.393 --> 01:19:58.961
A woman who follows her heart

1640
01:19:59.134 --> 01:20:02.312
and I trust you're applying that
in your love life as well.


1641
01:20:02.486 --> 01:20:05.925
It's show time. Oh, and for
tonight, maybe it's best to...


1642
01:20:06.098 --> 01:20:07.258
Stick to the script.
Got it.


1643
01:20:07.317 --> 01:20:08.317
Yeah.

1644
01:20:13.628 --> 01:20:15.345
And you'd think after
the bowling and the dancing


1645
01:20:15.369 --> 01:20:18.067
we'd call it quits, but no.

1646
01:20:18.241 --> 01:20:20.113
After the three required dates,

1647
01:20:20.287 --> 01:20:22.245
we decided to try some
bonus dates.


1648
01:20:22.419 --> 01:20:25.292
We visited an art museum,
rode a tandem bike...


1649
01:20:25.466 --> 01:20:29.949
I even learned to bake cookies
without using a recipe.


1650
01:20:30.123 --> 01:20:31.124
A sweet adventure.

1651
01:20:32.777 --> 01:20:34.388
All the while,
waiting for a spark


1652
01:20:34.562 --> 01:20:37.870
to ignite a flame
within our hearts.


1653
01:20:38.044 --> 01:20:41.351
And, it did.

1654
01:20:41.525 --> 01:20:43.353
In mine, at least.

1655
01:20:43.527 --> 01:20:48.968
Her name is Molly and she is the
most adorable rescue dog ever.


1656
01:20:49.142 --> 01:20:50.404
So now for the big reveal.

1657
01:20:51.839 --> 01:20:53.363
Excuse me, I had a question.

1658
01:20:53.537 --> 01:20:55.577
Uh yes, there'll be time
for questions at the end.


1659
01:20:58.064 --> 01:21:02.503
I was just wondering
if you fell in love.


1660
01:21:02.677 --> 01:21:05.071
You know, found the one?

1661
01:21:08.988 --> 01:21:12.382
Yes. Yes, I did.

1662
01:21:12.556 --> 01:21:16.821
I did fall in love, but I was
afraid to tell the man


1663
01:21:16.996 --> 01:21:18.301
that I fell in love with.

1664
01:21:18.475 --> 01:21:20.259
It's the story of my life,
really.


1665
01:21:20.434 --> 01:21:23.872
Turns out, there's more
to learn from my research.


1666
01:21:24.046 --> 01:21:31.967
Love is infinite, mysterious
and goes much deeper than data.


1667
01:21:32.141 --> 01:21:34.013
You see, I had given up on love.

1668
01:21:34.187 --> 01:21:36.102
Afraid my heart would take
another beating.


1669
01:21:36.276 --> 01:21:38.539
But, to be in love,

1670
01:21:38.713 --> 01:21:44.152
even just for a short time
is worth the heartbreak.


1671
01:21:50.507 --> 01:21:53.467
- That's so sweet.
- Cue the romantic music, right?


1672
01:21:53.641 --> 01:21:57.993
- A good cheesy love song.
- Cheesier the better.


1673
01:21:58.167 --> 01:22:02.998
Um, random question, but who'd
be your ideal dinner guest?


1674
01:22:03.172 --> 01:22:06.262
Frost. Dickinson.
Nope, Whitman.


1675
01:22:06.436 --> 01:22:08.917
I like poetry.

1676
01:22:09.091 --> 01:22:10.701
Two out of three.

1677
01:22:10.875 --> 01:22:15.968
And, um, what's the most
beautiful view you've ever seen?


1678
01:22:16.142 --> 01:22:18.231
The one I'm looking at.

1679
01:22:20.973 --> 01:22:22.583
Sorry to interrupt, folks.

1680
01:22:22.757 --> 01:22:24.977
But, in case you didn't know,

1681
01:22:25.151 --> 01:22:29.589
our new marketing slogan
is Research with Heart.


1682
01:22:29.764 --> 01:22:33.811
Which is exactly what Doctor
Carver showed tonight.


1683
01:22:33.986 --> 01:22:35.639
Heart.

1684
01:22:35.812 --> 01:22:39.382
So, I have decided to postpone
our study's release.


1685
01:22:39.556 --> 01:22:42.995
Sounds like some revisions
are in order.


1686
01:22:43.169 --> 01:22:46.128
That ok with you?

1687
01:22:47.738 --> 01:22:51.177
Remember Brooke,
follow your heart.


1688
01:22:59.402 --> 01:23:02.884
Thanks for the flowers.
The way to a woman's heart.


1689
01:23:03.058 --> 01:23:05.060
Well, like I said,

1690
01:23:05.234 --> 01:23:07.976
just trying to make your day
a little more perfect.


1691
01:23:08.150 --> 01:23:11.937
Well, there is one thing
that could make it more perfect.


1692
01:23:21.120 --> 01:23:22.120
Yes!

1693
01:23:23.949 --> 01:23:25.776
That's my boy!
