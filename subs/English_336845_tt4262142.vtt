a life in prison.


1272
01:24:39.292 --> 01:24:42.194
I can forgive you
but I can't forget.


1273
01:24:42.227 --> 01:24:44.162
[**]

1274
01:24:45.798 --> 01:24:48.233
With the guidance of God

1275
01:24:49.635 --> 01:24:52.771
I will prevail
and help others


1276
01:24:52.805 --> 01:24:56.475
that suffer at the hands
of others.


1277
01:24:56.509 --> 01:24:59.945
Writing this statement
gave me the strength


1278
01:24:59.978 --> 01:25:02.415
to be a stronger woman

1279
01:25:02.448 --> 01:25:09.688
and I know there is more good
than there is evil.


1280
01:25:09.722 --> 01:25:11.990
I know that
there's a lot of people


1281
01:25:12.024 --> 01:25:15.260
going through hard times.

1282
01:25:15.294 --> 01:25:17.930
But we need to reach out
a hand and hold them


1283
01:25:17.963 --> 01:25:20.666
and let them know
that they're being heard.


1284
01:25:24.169 --> 01:25:29.508
After 11 years,
I'm finally being heard


1285
01:25:29.542 --> 01:25:33.011
and it's liberating.

1286
01:25:33.045 --> 01:25:35.348
Thank you all.

1287
01:25:35.381 --> 01:25:37.182
I love you.

1288
01:25:39.318 --> 01:25:41.387
And God bless.

1289
01:25:41.420 --> 01:25:43.356

1291
01:26:23.028 --> 01:26:28.701
* Living all alone
In the corners of my mind *


1292
01:26:30.603 --> 01:26:36.208
* Hoping, praying, wishing
To see you one more time *


1293
01:26:38.110 --> 01:26:41.246
* Living alone
My baby's shadows *


1294
01:26:41.279 --> 01:26:43.749
* Dance across the wall

1295
01:26:45.818 --> 01:26:51.323
* In my dreams I hold you
And never let you fall *


1296
01:26:53.291 --> 01:26:59.164
* Living all alone
In the corners of my mind *


1297
01:27:00.833 --> 01:27:07.339
* Hoping, praying, wishing
To see you one more time *


1298
01:27:07.372 --> 01:27:12.945
* See you one more time
One more time *
