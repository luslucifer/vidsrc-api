00:02:05.717 --> 00:02:11.675
<i>Huda's Salon</i>

2
00:02:13.467 --> 00:02:15.717
- It's hot.
- Oh, sorry.


3
00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:18.300
It's all right.

4
00:02:18.383 --> 00:02:19.800
Why is the place empty today?

5
00:02:19.883 --> 00:02:23.217
You know, Reem, nowadays
everyone does their own hair.


6
00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:25.675
- Is it better now?
- Yes, thanks.


7
00:02:25.758 --> 00:02:30.133
The world is changing so fast,
I don't understand it anymore.


8
00:02:30.217 --> 00:02:35.550
They go to YouTube,
and copy haircuts poorly


9
00:02:35.633 --> 00:02:39.175
dye it with awful colors,
and have the nerve to call it fashion.


10
00:02:39.258 --> 00:02:43.008
It's a disaster when everyone
thinks they're an artist.


11
00:02:43.092 --> 00:02:47.258
- Filming and sharing everything online.
- Right.


12
00:02:47.342 --> 00:02:49.925
Have you seen the latest haircuts
on Facebook?


13
00:02:50.008 --> 00:02:54.467
Facebook is a disaster in itself.
Listen to this:


14
00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:59.925
My sister sent me pictures of two pairs
of shoes that she couldn't decide on.


15
00:03:00.008 --> 00:03:01.717
Then Suad sends me a message.

16
00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:03.883
- Suad Kasim?
- No, Diab.


17
00:03:03.967 --> 00:03:05.217
The Mosquito?

18
00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:08.675
- The one with the shoe shop?
- Let me continue.


19
00:03:08.758 --> 00:03:12.925
She said that the brown shoe is better.
But how did she know that?


20
00:03:13.008 --> 00:03:14.842
I called her to figure it out.

21
00:03:14.925 --> 00:03:20.592
I'd hit the 'share' button by mistake. All
my photos went straight to my Facebook.


22
00:03:20.675 --> 00:03:24.383
Half of the city saw my pictures.
Nobody commented, except the Mosquito.


23
00:03:24.467 --> 00:03:26.133
What a lowlife.

24
00:03:26.217 --> 00:03:32.592
She wanted to remind you to buy from her.
Her shoes are ugly like her face.


25
00:03:32.675 --> 00:03:36.383
Exactly. She pestered me about
why we don't buy from her anymore.


26
00:03:36.467 --> 00:03:39.050
So, I had to promise
that I would visit her shop.


27
00:03:39.133 --> 00:03:41.092
Despicable woman.

28
00:03:41.175 --> 00:03:44.217
Between you and me:
Facebook is a real pain in the ass.


29
00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:50.008
God knows what they put in our asses,
and who's benefiting from all of it.


30
00:03:50.092 --> 00:03:54.092
What I want to know is,
why do we use it for free?


31
00:03:54.175 --> 00:03:59.217
Because we're idiots. They sell us
like stupid cattle at the farm show


32
00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:03.092
and then we thank God for it.
We're just like this joke.


33
00:04:03.175 --> 00:04:07.300
A girl asks her friend: 'Did you marry
for tradition or out of love?'


34
00:04:07.383 --> 00:04:10.133
She answers: 'Out of stupidity.'

35
00:04:10.217 --> 00:04:12.175
- All done.
- She has a point.


36
00:04:15.008 --> 00:04:18.383
Oh, what's the matter? My baby.

37
00:04:22.008 --> 00:04:23.758
What is it now?

38
00:04:23.842 --> 00:04:26.133
Lost your dummy?

39
00:04:28.758 --> 00:04:32.800
Damn, my wrinkles
are taking over my face.


40
00:04:32.883 --> 00:04:34.550
Having a kid really ages you.

41
00:04:34.633 --> 00:04:38.050
With or without a kid,
you're going to age.


42
00:04:38.133 --> 00:04:40.300
So, tell me, where have you been?

43
00:04:40.383 --> 00:04:44.175
Seems like you disappeared
since you got married.


44
00:04:44.258 --> 00:04:48.967
- My husband barely lets me breathe.
- Oh, God. How come?


45
00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:52.467
He still thinks
I'm in love with someone else.


46
00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:55.300
- Are you?
- How can you love anyone in this dump?


47
00:04:55.383 --> 00:04:58.592
- Right. So tell him.
- I did.


48
00:04:58.675 --> 00:05:01.842
He says he loves me too much,
so he struggles to believe me.


49
00:05:03.967 --> 00:05:08.883
Girl, you don't love him.
And he feels it. End of story.


50
00:05:08.967 --> 00:05:11.883
I mean, I was in love with him
when we were engaged.


51
00:05:11.967 --> 00:05:14.550
But after we got married,
he started to drive me nuts.


52
00:05:14.633 --> 00:05:18.217
- He wasn't the same Yousef.
- They're all the same.


53
00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:20.883
Enough about men.
When will you go back to work?


54
00:05:20.967 --> 00:05:26.425
You have golden hands. Ever since you left
Rita's Salon, her place is a mess.


55
00:05:26.508 --> 00:05:30.050
When Lina is a little older,
I might open my own salon.


56
00:05:30.133 --> 00:05:32.592
Really?
Would your husband agree to that?


57
00:05:32.675 --> 00:05:36.675
Who cares? He wants me to stay home,
but it's not up to him.


58
00:05:36.758 --> 00:05:39.300
- God bless your daughter.
- Thanks.


59
00:05:41.175 --> 00:05:42.717
What about you?

60
00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:48.342
What about your kids? Can you still
not see them? Or visit them in Hebron?


61
00:05:48.425 --> 00:05:52.467
- What would you like to drink?
- Coffee, please. To wake me up.


62
00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:57.217
Sure. But let me put you
under the hairdryer first.


63
00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:10.550
You still use this thing?
It's suffocating.


64
00:06:10.633 --> 00:06:12.133
It won't need long.

65
00:06:16.675 --> 00:06:20.050
I'm so sick of sitting at home.
I'm so glad I could come here.


66
00:06:20.133 --> 00:06:24.508
Always welcome.
Even just to have a coffee.


67
00:06:25.258 --> 00:06:27.258
Yeah, I should do that more.

68
00:06:28.425 --> 00:06:31.217
Look. The best cup of coffee.

69
00:06:33.342 --> 00:06:35.675
- For the prettiest girl in town.
- Thank you.


70
00:06:46.133 --> 00:06:50.133
- Did you add cardamom? It's bitter.
- I didn't.


71
00:06:50.217 --> 00:06:52.925
It's a new blend. 
It'll grow on you.

72
00:06:55.425 --> 00:06:57.008
What would you like me to do today?

73
00:06:58.383 --> 00:07:02.008
- Just a trim? Maybe with bangs?
- Certainly.


74
00:07:11.842 --> 00:07:15.050
I look like a baboon in your mirror.

75
00:07:15.133 --> 00:07:19.133
It's not my mirror, sweetie.
You're just a little down.


76
00:07:20.175 --> 00:07:22.592
I had a row this morning.

77
00:07:22.675 --> 00:07:26.633
We'll get your hair done.
You'll feel a lot better.


78
00:07:26.717 --> 00:07:29.758
No, no, forget it, just style it.

79
00:07:31.217 --> 00:07:33.050
My head is killing me.

80
00:08:12.883 --> 00:08:14.717
Move your ass.

81
00:08:19.300 --> 00:08:20.717
Up.

82
00:08:24.467 --> 00:08:27.592
You couldn't find someone thinner?
I have back problems.


83
00:08:27.675 --> 00:08:31.592
Next time I'll bring you a catalog.
Picky bastard.


84
00:08:42.050 --> 00:08:45.175
Listen, 200 shekels is not enough.

85
00:08:45.258 --> 00:08:48.508
The taxi here and back costs me 50.

86
00:08:49.883 --> 00:08:54.758
If you want me to come back,
you must pay me at least 300.


87
00:08:54.842 --> 00:08:57.633
Shut up, you're giving me a headache.

88
00:08:59.467 --> 00:09:01.758
Then find someone else.

89
00:09:03.675 --> 00:09:05.967
- I have work to do.
- Strip her down.


90
00:09:06.050 --> 00:09:07.800
You boss me around.

91
00:09:07.883 --> 00:09:11.967
Telling me to get dressed
and undressed. It's not easy.


92
00:09:12.050 --> 00:09:14.967
I'd rather stay home.

93
00:09:16.175 --> 00:09:19.550
- Need help to open her eyes?
- No, go get ready.


94
00:09:19.633 --> 00:09:21.050
Hurry up.

95
00:09:22.842 --> 00:09:24.633
I said I can manage.

96
00:10:08.175 --> 00:10:10.258
Hands, you pervert. Get up.

97
00:10:34.467 --> 00:10:36.258
Where am I?

98
00:10:46.175 --> 00:10:47.675
Huda?

99
00:10:48.508 --> 00:10:49.758
What happened?

100
00:11:01.258 --> 00:11:02.800
I took it.

101
00:11:04.092 --> 00:11:07.425
I'm not going to drag this out.
We want you to work with us.


102
00:11:12.675 --> 00:11:16.467
- Who... Who are you?
- Secret Service.


103
00:11:20.967 --> 00:11:23.675
Secret Service for...

104
00:11:23.758 --> 00:11:25.175
The occupation?

105
00:11:30.175 --> 00:11:31.550
Who is this guy?

106
00:11:35.258 --> 00:11:36.675
What did he do to me, Huda?

107
00:11:42.967 --> 00:11:47.133
I know you're shocked.
It's going to take time.


108
00:11:47.217 --> 00:11:50.842
But don't worry,
I did not let him touch you.


109
00:12:08.675 --> 00:12:13.342
Huda. You know Yousef
will never believe me.


110
00:12:15.967 --> 00:12:17.467
Such a man is useless.

111
00:12:20.550 --> 00:12:22.925
How could you?

112
00:12:31.300 --> 00:12:32.508
Why?

113
00:12:33.592 --> 00:12:37.050
Why? I have a child.

114
00:12:37.133 --> 00:12:40.383
You want me to become a traitor.
How could you?


115
00:12:40.467 --> 00:12:42.133
Calm down.

116
00:12:44.633 --> 00:12:45.717
Calm down.

117
00:12:47.008 --> 00:12:48.050
Enough.

118
00:12:52.967 --> 00:12:56.175
There's nothing you can do.
It is what it is.


119
00:12:56.258 --> 00:12:59.133
Don't shout. You don't want anyone
to find you like this.


120
00:13:16.633 --> 00:13:20.592
If you tell your husband
or anyone else


121
00:13:20.675 --> 00:13:24.217
the Secret Service will be ruthless.
Merciless.


122
00:13:24.300 --> 00:13:28.258
And your daughter will pay the price.

123
00:13:35.008 --> 00:13:36.467
We're all in the same boat.

124
00:13:40.175 --> 00:13:42.508
But...

125
00:13:42.592 --> 00:13:43.842
But why me?

126
00:13:45.883 --> 00:13:47.217
People are strange.

127
00:13:48.425 --> 00:13:54.342
When something bad happens to them,
they ask God, 'Why me?'


128
00:13:54.425 --> 00:13:57.842
But never
when something good happens.


129
00:13:57.925 --> 00:14:01.092
Even though it's all God's will, no?

130
00:14:01.175 --> 00:14:03.925
- God's will?
- Yes.


131
00:14:11.967 --> 00:14:13.300
I understand you.

132
00:14:16.925 --> 00:14:18.550
I know it's not easy.

133
00:14:30.550 --> 00:14:32.883
This is the number
of a guy named Musa.


134
00:14:32.967 --> 00:14:35.967
If you have any helpful information,

135
00:14:36.050 --> 00:14:39.217
wanted rebels, weapons, anything,

136
00:14:39.300 --> 00:14:41.467
give him a call and he'll reward you.

137
00:14:45.008 --> 00:14:46.633
You're disgusting.

138
00:14:56.967 --> 00:14:58.175
Keep it.

139
00:14:59.508 --> 00:15:01.717
Cut it out. You're not a little girl.

140
00:15:02.675 --> 00:15:04.425
It won't hurt to keep it.

141
00:15:04.925 --> 00:15:07.008
If you choose not to use it,

142
00:15:07.883 --> 00:15:11.550
the photo is my guarantee
that you won't snitch on me.


143
00:15:19.508 --> 00:15:21.717
Let me finish your hair before you leave.

144
00:15:48.758 --> 00:15:50.133
Taxi.

145
00:15:57.342 --> 00:15:59.633
A woman with a child just rushed out.

146
00:15:59.717 --> 00:16:03.217
She clearly wasn't there for her hair.
Should I follow?


147
00:18:12.925 --> 00:18:14.842
Why didn't you get your hair cut?

148
00:18:15.925 --> 00:18:17.633
I didn't have time.

149
00:18:17.717 --> 00:18:21.258
You left early.
All this time with your boyfriend?


150
00:18:22.508 --> 00:18:24.967
- Please.
- I'm kidding.


151
00:18:25.883 --> 00:18:27.383
It's not funny.

152
00:18:29.800 --> 00:18:34.550
Should I mash it and feed her?
Much better than processed food.


153
00:18:35.467 --> 00:18:38.092
She's still too young.

154
00:18:38.175 --> 00:18:40.633
- Did you even try?
- She's too young.


155
00:18:42.175 --> 00:18:43.967
Let me. I'll try.

156
00:18:46.842 --> 00:18:50.092
Here, Lina. Open wide.

157
00:18:51.633 --> 00:18:56.008
Come on. Trust me,
don't be stubborn like your mom.


158
00:18:56.092 --> 00:18:58.008
Come on.

159
00:18:58.092 --> 00:19:00.883
She took a bite.
Oh, no... Come on.


160
00:19:00.967 --> 00:19:02.717
Yousef, you shouldn't.

161
00:19:04.217 --> 00:19:06.508
Fine, see if I care.

162
00:19:10.175 --> 00:19:13.883
Love, what's wrong?

163
00:19:13.967 --> 00:19:15.675
I told you, my stomach hurts.

164
00:19:17.133 --> 00:19:19.425
- Have some tea.
- I had some.


165
00:19:25.717 --> 00:19:27.675
What will you cook tomorrow?

166
00:19:28.758 --> 00:19:30.925
I don't know. Why?

167
00:19:31.008 --> 00:19:33.508
My mother and siblings will join us.

168
00:19:34.592 --> 00:19:35.842
The more the merrier.

169
00:19:38.883 --> 00:19:42.008
Love, what's wrong?

170
00:19:42.092 --> 00:19:43.967
Nothing.

171
00:19:49.342 --> 00:19:51.050
Do you not want them to come?

172
00:19:52.008 --> 00:19:53.300
This again?

173
00:19:54.175 --> 00:19:56.008
Okay, relax.

174
00:20:00.342 --> 00:20:02.258
Want to make us coffee?

175
00:20:04.342 --> 00:20:06.050
We ran out.

176
00:20:57.383 --> 00:21:00.300
Yousef, for God's sake, not today.

177
00:21:00.383 --> 00:21:02.300
You say that every day.

178
00:21:02.383 --> 00:21:05.300
My stomach hurts
and I don't want another fight.


179
00:21:05.383 --> 00:21:07.050
We're done fighting.

180
00:21:08.842 --> 00:21:12.008
- Why are you so moody lately?
- I swear it's nothing.


181
00:21:14.633 --> 00:21:16.175
I know you.

182
00:21:17.175 --> 00:21:18.675
Something is bothering you.

183
00:21:21.383 --> 00:21:23.425
Yousef, if I died, what would you do?

184
00:21:26.883 --> 00:21:28.717
What's wrong with you?

185
00:21:28.800 --> 00:21:30.008
What is it?

186
00:21:30.675 --> 00:21:32.383
Would you marry someone else?

187
00:21:36.133 --> 00:21:38.592
You know I never would.

188
00:21:38.675 --> 00:21:41.842
There's no one else
in my heart but you.

189
00:21:41.925 --> 00:21:45.133
Why not? Who would take care of Lina?

190
00:21:49.050 --> 00:21:50.467
Love, what is it?

191
00:21:51.175 --> 00:21:53.258
What are you afraid of? Tell me.

192
00:21:55.633 --> 00:21:58.133
I feel like I'm
going to die very soon.

193
00:21:59.258 --> 00:22:01.217
God forbid. Let it be me instead.

194
00:22:01.300 --> 00:22:03.758
- I'm serious.
- Me, too.


195
00:22:07.758 --> 00:22:10.342
- Can I trust you?
- Of course.


196
00:22:11.633 --> 00:22:13.550
Then why don't you trust me?

197
00:22:13.633 --> 00:22:16.300
Why can't you believe
that there's no one else?


198
00:22:47.550 --> 00:22:50.342
Yousef, go check on Lina.

199
00:22:51.717 --> 00:22:52.967
Yousef.

200
00:23:13.050 --> 00:23:14.967
I'm coming, sweetie.

201
00:23:15.883 --> 00:23:17.342
I'm here.

202
00:23:19.800 --> 00:23:21.592
Naughty girl.

203
00:23:23.300 --> 00:23:25.050
You're burning up.

204
00:23:31.633 --> 00:23:35.008
Yousef, Lina has a fever.

205
00:23:37.800 --> 00:23:39.008
What?

206
00:25:10.758 --> 00:25:14.842
Holy Mother. What's going on?
Who are you? Get away from me.


207
00:27:41.342 --> 00:27:42.925
This is the one I saw leaving.

208
00:27:43.008 --> 00:27:46.342
- Do you know where she went?
- No. You told me to watch the salon.


209
00:27:54.467 --> 00:27:56.425
Who is this? You know her?

210
00:27:56.508 --> 00:27:59.633
Safaa. May she rest in peace.

211
00:28:01.842 --> 00:28:04.217
Pay attention to the faces.

212
00:28:08.425 --> 00:28:10.300
Wait, wait.

213
00:28:10.383 --> 00:28:12.675
This guy...

214
00:28:15.925 --> 00:28:19.383
- Said Al-Qazaz, I know him.
- Who is he?


215
00:28:19.467 --> 00:28:22.508
- Some lowlife, I know him.
- What are you waiting for?


216
00:29:00.383 --> 00:29:01.675
Darling.

217
00:29:05.508 --> 00:29:06.842
Come on.

218
00:29:11.467 --> 00:29:16.133
<i>Lina, Lina, little one.</i>

219
00:29:16.217 --> 00:29:20.425
<i>Your hair is black and soft.</i>

220
00:29:21.467 --> 00:29:25.675
<i>Anyone who holds you loves you</i>

221
00:29:25.758 --> 00:29:30.425
<i>and will never let you go.</i>

222
00:30:08.967 --> 00:30:14.633
I swear to God I know nothing.
I just get 200 shekels per photo.


223
00:30:14.717 --> 00:30:17.258
I've told you before, I want names.

224
00:30:17.342 --> 00:30:21.842
I just know they work for Huda.
I swear, I don't know them.


225
00:30:21.925 --> 00:30:25.550
Start talking.
Which of these girls do you know?


226
00:30:25.633 --> 00:30:28.758
I'd give you their names
if I knew, I swear.


227
00:30:28.842 --> 00:30:31.217
Have mercy. I have kids to feed.

228
00:30:31.300 --> 00:30:32.300
Please.

229
00:30:32.383 --> 00:30:35.467
The only thing I know about Huda
is that she's divorced.


230
00:30:35.550 --> 00:30:41.717
And her sons left her. That's all I know.
You've got believe me. It's the truth.


231
00:30:41.800 --> 00:30:43.258
You're going to die anyway.

232
00:30:43.342 --> 00:30:45.842
We're going to burn you
whether you speak or not.


233
00:30:45.925 --> 00:30:47.592
If you want to live a little longer,
speak up.


234
00:30:47.675 --> 00:30:49.758
Stop. Don't do this.

235
00:30:49.842 --> 00:30:53.383
How do they communicate?
Tell me. Who runs them?


236
00:30:53.467 --> 00:30:55.383
Speak up. How do they work?

237
00:30:56.467 --> 00:31:01.050
I don't know. I really don't.
I was just a model.


238
00:31:01.133 --> 00:31:05.008
- What did you do to those girls?
- I was just the goddamn model.


239
00:31:05.092 --> 00:31:09.883
- Seems like he really doesn't know.
- Isam, tell him. Please God, help me.


240
00:31:09.967 --> 00:31:12.425
Now you want God to help you?

241
00:31:12.508 --> 00:31:15.675
- You want God's mercy?
- Yes, mercy.


242
00:31:15.758 --> 00:31:20.008
Listen, you had no mercy
for any of those girls.


243
00:31:20.092 --> 00:31:22.383
Now you want God's mercy?

244
00:31:22.467 --> 00:31:25.675
If you were just a traitor,
I'd have ended you with a bullet.


245
00:31:25.758 --> 00:31:27.842
But you're filthier than a rapist.

246
00:31:27.925 --> 00:31:33.092
We'll burn you to feel the same pain
you inflicted on these women.


247
00:31:33.175 --> 00:31:34.717
No.

248
00:31:34.800 --> 00:31:38.508
No, please. Have mercy.

249
00:33:45.217 --> 00:33:46.425
So?

250
00:33:48.758 --> 00:33:50.675
So, what?

251
00:34:09.842 --> 00:34:11.550
Those girls are not guilty.

252
00:34:11.633 --> 00:34:14.425
I'm the one who's guilty
and I'm ready to die.


253
00:34:15.300 --> 00:34:18.217
Anything else you want to know
I can tell you.


254
00:34:18.633 --> 00:34:21.925
But I won't give you any names.

255
00:34:22.008 --> 00:34:25.633
It's not about who's guilty or not.

256
00:34:25.717 --> 00:34:29.175
Having traitors among us is catastrophic.

257
00:34:30.842 --> 00:34:35.175
- Why should their families pay the price?
- You should have asked yourself that.


258
00:34:36.258 --> 00:34:39.717
Look, I know the pain
their families will suffer.


259
00:34:39.800 --> 00:34:43.300
But as the resistance,
we have no other choice.


260
00:34:44.508 --> 00:34:50.258
Traitors in our society
are like a cancer in the body.


261
00:34:51.508 --> 00:34:53.050
Chemotherapy.

262
00:34:54.967 --> 00:34:57.883
It also kills healthy cells.

263
00:34:59.342 --> 00:35:02.008
Not just cancerous ones.

264
00:35:02.092 --> 00:35:04.050
But in the end...

265
00:35:06.133 --> 00:35:10.967
we all just hope
that chemo leads to recovery.


266
00:35:12.092 --> 00:35:15.050
Bravo. You memorized that by heart.

267
00:35:15.925 --> 00:35:17.883
Listen, you bitch.

268
00:35:17.967 --> 00:35:20.467
You think you can play around with me?

269
00:35:20.550 --> 00:35:23.008
I could crush you with my bare hands.

270
00:36:14.842 --> 00:36:17.342
Congrats. She's going to have a girl.

271
00:36:17.425 --> 00:36:21.300
Oh, God. Her fourth girl.

272
00:36:21.383 --> 00:36:24.925
- Are you sure it's a girl?
- Only God can be sure.


273
00:36:27.842 --> 00:36:32.758
- Isn't there another test to be sure?
- Ma'am, it's all in God's hands.


274
00:36:32.842 --> 00:36:37.092
- Did you hear about Samira?
- No, what happened?


275
00:36:38.050 --> 00:36:41.592
She has breast cancer
and she won't tell her husband.


276
00:36:41.675 --> 00:36:45.342
- Poor girl. Why?
- She's afraid he'll divorce her.


277
00:36:45.425 --> 00:36:47.508
Poor Samira. That's terrible.

278
00:36:47.592 --> 00:36:53.300
She'd rather die than get a divorce.
Can you believe it?


279
00:37:07.842 --> 00:37:10.925
Leave the names aside.
We'll get back to them.


280
00:37:12.467 --> 00:37:15.258
Let's hear your story first.

281
00:37:16.592 --> 00:37:19.967
- What do you want to know?
- Everything.


282
00:37:20.050 --> 00:37:22.508
Why did you betray your people?

283
00:37:23.925 --> 00:37:27.717
The Secret Service caught me with a man
and threatened me.


284
00:37:27.800 --> 00:37:31.550
Either they expose me and my husband
kills me, or I work for them.


285
00:37:31.633 --> 00:37:35.925
You make me feel you're the victim here.
Why cheat in the first place?


286
00:37:36.008 --> 00:37:38.925
- Do you know my husband?
- I haven't had the honor.


287
00:37:39.008 --> 00:37:41.342
Try living with him one day
and get back to me.


288
00:37:42.592 --> 00:37:45.675
There are a thousand ways to leave him
on good terms.


289
00:37:45.758 --> 00:37:48.383
- Then remarry on good terms.
- Oh, really?


290
00:37:48.467 --> 00:37:50.883
Do you think you're living in Sweden?

291
00:37:50.967 --> 00:37:54.342
Aren't you divorced? And you're here.
Not in Sweden.


292
00:37:55.842 --> 00:38:00.592
I had to wait till my kids were older.
And now I'm not allowed to see them.


293
00:38:00.675 --> 00:38:03.967
How is that right?
I was the one who raised them.


294
00:38:05.592 --> 00:38:09.758
I know that our society
needs a good wake-up call.


295
00:38:09.842 --> 00:38:12.383
But you can't right a wrong
with a wrong.


296
00:38:13.758 --> 00:38:16.800
- You're about to do just that.
- How so?


297
00:38:16.883 --> 00:38:19.758
You want to punish those girls,
but I'm the guilty one.


298
00:38:30.050 --> 00:38:32.008
Are you married?

299
00:38:32.092 --> 00:38:35.050
So, you pick them young and pretty?

300
00:38:36.300 --> 00:38:39.925
If you want information, at least pretend
you're open to a conversation.


301
00:38:47.758 --> 00:38:51.675
- What do you want to know?
- Can I get some water?


302
00:39:26.300 --> 00:39:28.050
Next, please.

303
00:39:40.008 --> 00:39:41.717
What's wrong, my dear?

304
00:39:44.008 --> 00:39:46.675
If you need help, just tell me.

305
00:40:01.300 --> 00:40:08.300
<i>death to traitors</i>

306
00:40:49.342 --> 00:40:52.008
My job was simply to recruit the girls.

307
00:40:52.092 --> 00:40:55.425
- How much did they pay you per girl?
- 1,200 shekels.


308
00:40:55.508 --> 00:40:57.133
Cheapskates.

309
00:40:57.217 --> 00:41:00.217
But when Facebook came out,
they reduced it to 800.


310
00:41:00.300 --> 00:41:04.425
I don't need to take pictures now.
People publish their own scandals.


311
00:41:05.217 --> 00:41:07.217
How many girls did you compromise?

312
00:41:07.300 --> 00:41:09.050
- Count.
- I did.


313
00:41:09.133 --> 00:41:10.717
- How many?
- 15.


314
00:41:10.800 --> 00:41:13.592
- So why do you ask?
- Maybe there's one with no photo?


315
00:41:13.675 --> 00:41:16.967
And if there is,
do you really think I'd tell you?


316
00:41:18.383 --> 00:41:21.675
What kind of information
did they have to provide?


317
00:41:21.758 --> 00:41:24.467
The usual. Weapons, wanted rebels...

318
00:41:24.550 --> 00:41:26.842
- How much were the girls paid per snitch?
- Not much.


319
00:41:26.925 --> 00:41:29.467
Less than 800, but I don't know exactly.

320
00:41:29.550 --> 00:41:32.633
They mainly want permits for checkpoints.
Not money.


321
00:41:34.758 --> 00:41:40.175
So did they ask you to bring them down?
Did they choose the girls?


322
00:41:40.258 --> 00:41:42.050
No, I chose them.

323
00:41:43.383 --> 00:41:47.967
I agreed to bring a girl every 3 months.
It was the minimum they agreed to.


324
00:41:48.050 --> 00:41:50.800
And how did you choose the girls?

325
00:41:51.633 --> 00:41:54.175
Why one and not another?

326
00:41:55.092 --> 00:41:58.300
I chose girls
whose husbands were assholes.


327
00:42:00.967 --> 00:42:03.550
Oh, my God.
No one is going to believe you.


328
00:42:03.633 --> 00:42:05.842
It's going to fuel
all of Yousef's suspicions.


329
00:42:05.925 --> 00:42:09.675
The bigger problem is
if they find my photo.


330
00:42:09.758 --> 00:42:12.550
No one will believe that
I'm not a traitor.


331
00:42:12.633 --> 00:42:15.467
Why don't you swear to them
on the Quran that you're innocent?


332
00:42:15.550 --> 00:42:18.258
Even if the resistance believes me,
people won't.


333
00:42:18.342 --> 00:42:20.675
I'm going to die, Azza. 
I'm going to die.

334
00:42:20.758 --> 00:42:22.342
What are you going to do now?

335
00:42:23.758 --> 00:42:27.467
I must speak to Huda
and figure out what's going on.


336
00:42:27.550 --> 00:42:29.383
But she's probably in their hands now.

337
00:42:29.467 --> 00:42:32.383
And how will you get to her
without drawing attention?


338
00:42:33.800 --> 00:42:37.592
Should I call her?
Maybe she snuck her phone in.


339
00:42:37.675 --> 00:42:40.383
And if someone else answers?

340
00:42:40.467 --> 00:42:43.675
I'll pretend to be a client
who wants an appointment.


341
00:42:45.800 --> 00:42:49.133
- I don't have many options.
- What if they get your number?


342
00:42:49.217 --> 00:42:52.925
So what? If they don't have my photo,
I've got nothing to worry about.


343
00:42:53.008 --> 00:42:55.467
And if they do, then it
doesn't make a difference.


344
00:42:55.550 --> 00:42:57.258
That's it, I'm calling.

345
00:43:02.133 --> 00:43:03.842
<i>Hello?</i>

346
00:43:03.925 --> 00:43:06.717
- Is Huda there?
- <i>No, who's speaking?</i>


347
00:43:07.592 --> 00:43:10.383
I want to make an appointment
for a haircut.


348
00:43:10.467 --> 00:43:12.842
<i>Sure. Who's speaking?</i>

349
00:43:12.925 --> 00:43:15.133
Can I speak to Huda directly?

350
00:43:15.217 --> 00:43:18.717
<i>That's not possible.
She can't come to the phone right now.</i>


351
00:43:18.800 --> 00:43:20.883
Okay, then I'll call back later.

352
00:43:20.967 --> 00:43:24.633
- Who should I tell her called?
- <i>It's not important.</i>


353
00:43:24.717 --> 00:43:27.092
<i>I can tell her. 
I work for her.</i>

354
00:43:27.175 --> 00:43:29.008
<i>Why are you afraid to give your name?</i>

355
00:43:29.092 --> 00:43:33.633
I'm not afraid, but I don't know you.
Why would I give you my name?


356
00:43:33.717 --> 00:43:37.717
<i>So you didn't hear the news
and you simply want a haircut?</i>


357
00:43:39.050 --> 00:43:42.342
- What news?
- <i>Come on, do you think I'm that stupid?</i>


358
00:43:44.758 --> 00:43:47.925
<i>Fine, tell me what you know
about Huda.</i>


359
00:43:58.300 --> 00:44:00.175
Better call him back.

360
00:44:05.883 --> 00:44:11.758
<i>Believe me, we won't leave you alone,
even if hell freezes over.</i>


361
00:44:11.842 --> 00:44:14.592
<i>We'll drag you in by your ears.</i>

362
00:44:14.675 --> 00:44:16.925
God help us.

363
00:44:17.008 --> 00:44:19.342
Don't tell anyone at home
that I know.


364
00:44:19.425 --> 00:44:22.967
If they find out,
I'll be implicated with you, Reem.


365
00:44:29.383 --> 00:44:31.425
I'm sorry, Reem.

366
00:44:31.508 --> 00:44:34.342
I'm sorry I can't help. I'm sorry.

367
00:44:35.717 --> 00:44:37.967
They don't have your picture.

368
00:44:38.050 --> 00:44:40.842
We would have heard about it by now.
Trust in God.


369
00:44:42.967 --> 00:44:45.717
I have to find a way to protect
Lina and Yousef,


370
00:44:45.800 --> 00:44:47.925
in case they find my picture.

371
00:44:48.008 --> 00:44:49.633
I have to.

372
00:44:57.800 --> 00:45:04.217
<i>I had no one to help me.
A desperate woman is a cornered cat.</i>


373
00:45:04.300 --> 00:45:09.550
<i>- Scared, but also scary.
- You? Scared? Even death fears you.</i>


374
00:45:09.633 --> 00:45:14.092
<i>The same goes for you.
I think we can relate on this point.</i>


375
00:45:14.175 --> 00:45:17.633
- But I am afraid of death.
- Really?


376
00:45:17.717 --> 00:45:19.217
It doesn't seem like it.

377
00:45:19.300 --> 00:45:21.675
A freedom fighter
on the most wanted list.


378
00:45:23.717 --> 00:45:27.467
Everyone fears death. Some people
just know how to play the game.


379
00:45:27.550 --> 00:45:29.008
Most don't.

380
00:45:35.842 --> 00:45:38.092
Looks like you and I
know how to play it.

381
00:45:40.717 --> 00:45:43.383
I decided if this day came,
I'd play it grand.


382
00:45:43.467 --> 00:45:45.633
And not beg for my life.

383
00:45:45.717 --> 00:45:48.133
So you knew this day would come?

384
00:45:48.217 --> 00:45:50.967
I'll tell you,
but you need to talk first.


385
00:45:51.050 --> 00:45:54.050
Why did you join the resistance?

386
00:45:57.717 --> 00:46:01.675
Your secret is safe with me.
You know I'm headed for the grave.


387
00:46:01.758 --> 00:46:04.967
I just want to hear your story first.

388
00:46:07.300 --> 00:46:09.550
Why are you so curious?

389
00:46:10.550 --> 00:46:13.258
I'd like to know the story
of the last person I'll see.


390
00:46:20.800 --> 00:46:26.883
I'll tell what you want to know
if you tell me what lives inside you.


391
00:46:39.425 --> 00:46:43.467
When I was 11,
I had a friend called Muhanad.


392
00:46:46.258 --> 00:46:50.883
I tried to persuade him to throw rocks
at an army patrol jeep.


393
00:46:52.050 --> 00:46:54.008
He was afraid at first.

394
00:46:54.092 --> 00:46:55.758
I accused him of being a coward.

395
00:46:57.633 --> 00:47:00.967
He wanted to prove me wrong
so he came with me.


396
00:47:01.050 --> 00:47:05.925
There, I tried to persuade him
to throw the rock.


397
00:47:06.050 --> 00:47:08.217
A really big one.

398
00:47:08.300 --> 00:47:11.800
He refused, so I did it myself.

399
00:47:11.883 --> 00:47:13.925
The soldiers chased us.

400
00:47:14.008 --> 00:47:17.467
Muhanad managed to escape.
But they caught me.


401
00:47:19.217 --> 00:47:23.258
I swore to them that it wasn't me.

402
00:47:26.592 --> 00:47:30.925
One soldier slapped me so hard,
I got dizzy.


403
00:47:31.008 --> 00:47:33.842
Then he asked: '
Who did it then?'

404
00:47:33.925 --> 00:47:36.550
I was so afraid,
I told him it was Muhanad.


405
00:47:38.258 --> 00:47:41.425
They forced me
to take them to his house.


406
00:47:41.508 --> 00:47:44.133
When we got there...

407
00:47:46.592 --> 00:47:49.217
they shot him in front of his parents.

408
00:47:56.675 --> 00:48:00.467
Why did you bring others down
with you?


409
00:48:03.008 --> 00:48:06.342
For the same reason
you brought down Muhanad.


410
00:48:06.425 --> 00:48:09.842
When it comes down to your life
or that of others,


411
00:48:09.925 --> 00:48:11.717
what choice can you make?

412
00:48:32.592 --> 00:48:34.633
Who is she?

413
00:48:59.550 --> 00:49:01.425
Who is she?

414
00:49:04.842 --> 00:49:06.758
Who is she?

415
00:49:08.300 --> 00:49:10.883
Why did you hide this photo
in particular?


416
00:49:31.550 --> 00:49:33.883
Find me this one as soon as possible.

417
00:49:33.967 --> 00:49:39.675
Huda hid it. I feel she's different.
She may be the key.


418
00:49:39.758 --> 00:49:42.383
- She is the one I saw yesterday.
- Exactly.


419
00:49:42.467 --> 00:49:45.967
That's why we must find her.
Understood?


420
00:50:21.217 --> 00:50:22.758
Mom.

421
00:50:22.842 --> 00:50:26.300
- <i>What's wrong?</i>
- I don't know what to tell you.

422
00:50:27.425 --> 00:50:29.842
<i>You are worrying me.</i>

423
00:50:31.133 --> 00:50:34.258
This time I won't listen.
I'm leaving for Jordan.


424
00:50:34.383 --> 00:50:37.342
- <i>Dear God. Why?</i>
- Because.

425
00:50:37.425 --> 00:50:40.967
I am not sure Yousef will stand by me
no matter what.


426
00:50:43.300 --> 00:50:46.550
<i>I don't get you, Reem.
Do you want to leave Yousef?</i>


427
00:50:47.925 --> 00:50:52.592
<i>Girls today think marriage is bliss,
but darling, it takes effort.</i>


428
00:50:52.675 --> 00:50:57.633
<i>If you can fix the situation, fix it.
I don't have a magical solution.</i>


429
00:50:57.717 --> 00:51:02.675
- <i>Must Lina grow up in a broken home?</i>
- Better than a devastated one.

430
00:51:02.758 --> 00:51:06.633
<i>What are you babbling about?
You can't even travel.</i>


431
00:51:06.717 --> 00:51:11.717
<i>Your brother-in-law is in jail.
As a relative, you're banned from travel.</i>


432
00:51:11.800 --> 00:51:14.842
<i>You'd need a permit from
the Secret Service.</i>


433
00:51:14.925 --> 00:51:16.717
<i>How would you get one?</i>

434
00:51:19.008 --> 00:51:20.425
Bye, Mom.

435
00:51:21.967 --> 00:51:25.467
You chose women suffering in silence
at the hands of their asshole husbands.


436
00:51:27.050 --> 00:51:30.175
That way you could be sure they would
keep quiet on what you did.


437
00:51:31.258 --> 00:51:32.925
It's not the main reason.

438
00:51:33.008 --> 00:51:35.217
Oh, you have a main reason?

439
00:51:36.050 --> 00:51:39.967
Working with the Secret Service
gave these girls a sense of strength.


440
00:51:40.050 --> 00:51:41.717
By blackmailing them?

441
00:51:42.508 --> 00:51:46.217
They stood up to their husbands
once they got some courage.


442
00:51:48.133 --> 00:51:50.508
By collaborating with the enemy?
The occupation?


443
00:51:50.592 --> 00:51:52.300
Which enemy?

444
00:51:52.383 --> 00:51:54.008
Everyone is an enemy.

445
00:51:54.633 --> 00:51:59.092
It's easier to occupy a society
that is already repressing itself.


446
00:52:00.717 --> 00:52:05.300
You're exhausting me. You keep
bringing us back to square one.


447
00:52:05.758 --> 00:52:08.592
To waste time.
But your time is up.


448
00:52:17.925 --> 00:52:22.258
I know you like this song.
Don't you?


449
00:52:51.383 --> 00:52:54.008
<i>So you think you're a freedom fighter?</i>

450
00:52:54.092 --> 00:52:56.550
<i>You only flex your muscle on the weak.</i>

451
00:52:56.633 --> 00:52:59.967
<i>You choked me.
You're just another sad little hypocrite.</i>


452
00:53:00.050 --> 00:53:04.133
- What kind of a devil are you?
- Go on, then. Hit me.


453
00:53:04.217 --> 00:53:06.133
Show me how strong you are.

454
00:53:16.967 --> 00:53:18.258
That's not what I'm here for.

455
00:53:19.675 --> 00:53:23.883
I have a specialist waiting outside.

456
00:53:25.758 --> 00:53:29.092
Don't force me to bring him in.

457
00:53:30.300 --> 00:53:32.758
Do you know why you're upset?

458
00:53:32.842 --> 00:53:37.717
- You're now a part-time psychologist?
- No, I've just known a lot of men.


459
00:53:37.800 --> 00:53:39.800
How fabulous.

460
00:53:39.883 --> 00:53:44.175
You're upset because you're self-righteous
and I am exposing you.


461
00:53:44.967 --> 00:53:46.633
Oh, sweet patience.

462
00:53:46.717 --> 00:53:50.050
You told me your story,
so you think your crime is laid to rest?


463
00:53:50.133 --> 00:53:54.008
You're a coward
playing the freedom fighter.


464
00:53:54.092 --> 00:53:55.925
Listen, you.

465
00:53:57.092 --> 00:54:00.717
I don't give a shit
what you think of me.

466
00:54:00.800 --> 00:54:03.925
I'm just trying to decide

467
00:54:04.008 --> 00:54:08.383
whether I should use force myself

468
00:54:08.467 --> 00:54:10.800
or whether I should bring
in the specialist.


469
00:54:31.508 --> 00:54:34.342
Someone like Huda needs
someone like me.


470
00:54:36.633 --> 00:54:39.508
Man, what's wrong?
What's with you?


471
00:54:39.592 --> 00:54:42.800
Why won't you let me try? I'll have her
cough up the names in no time.


472
00:54:45.550 --> 00:54:50.883
Anyway, about this girl. I'm calling
all the numbers in Huda's cell phone.


473
00:54:51.675 --> 00:54:55.758
I'll trick them by offering clemency
in exchange for cooperation.


474
00:54:56.508 --> 00:55:01.967
- If we find her, we're done.
- I will, even if she's six feet under.


475
00:55:02.883 --> 00:55:07.050
"Tell me, Dad,
how did my infidel wife treat you?"


476
00:55:07.133 --> 00:55:12.425
The dad answers, "Son, it's not her.
Your mom's the infidel here."


477
00:55:13.383 --> 00:55:14.925
Good one.

478
00:55:15.008 --> 00:55:17.508
So she served him
and ceased to be an infidel?


479
00:55:17.592 --> 00:55:19.467
Don't push it.

480
00:55:19.550 --> 00:55:21.592
An infidel has nothing to do
with religion;


481
00:55:21.675 --> 00:55:23.050
it's all about your behavior.

482
00:55:23.133 --> 00:55:26.300
But your brother emphasized
the fact that


483
00:55:26.383 --> 00:55:29.508
after the wife served the man,
she ceased to be an infidel.


484
00:55:29.592 --> 00:55:31.883
If it was about
how she interacts with kids


485
00:55:31.967 --> 00:55:33.300
then it would be a different story.

486
00:55:33.383 --> 00:55:35.967
Wady, what is the moral here?

487
00:55:36.050 --> 00:55:40.175
Nothing, it's just a joke.
I was joking. That's all.


488
00:55:40.258 --> 00:55:43.050
You're quiet, Reem.
You're usually such a chatterbox.


489
00:55:43.133 --> 00:55:45.675
- I'm just listening.
- So what do you think?


490
00:55:45.758 --> 00:55:49.050
Is a woman an infidel
in how she treats her husband?


491
00:55:49.133 --> 00:55:51.258
Of course,
it's how she treats her husband.


492
00:55:51.342 --> 00:55:54.217
Then you're definitely an infidel.

493
00:55:54.300 --> 00:55:57.883
My infidel wife would be upgraded
to an atheist.


494
00:55:57.967 --> 00:56:02.425
If any of you were my husbands,
I would have divorced you.


495
00:56:02.508 --> 00:56:04.508
How do you deal with these morons?

496
00:56:04.592 --> 00:56:08.258
- Sahar, watch your tongue.
- Let's change the subject.


497
00:56:08.342 --> 00:56:11.342
When is Lina going to get
a little brother?


498
00:56:11.425 --> 00:56:13.133
Or a sister.

499
00:56:13.217 --> 00:56:17.175
Is this what happens to girls
when they go to university?


500
00:56:17.258 --> 00:56:22.967
We should have sent you to Deir el Zour
and let ISIS set you straight.


501
00:56:23.050 --> 00:56:25.758
- That's what she needs.
- For real, Reem.


502
00:56:25.842 --> 00:56:27.842
When will you have another one?

503
00:56:28.383 --> 00:56:30.467
When we've finished fixing up the house.

504
00:56:30.550 --> 00:56:33.383
- Will you change this color?
- What's wrong with it?


505
00:56:33.467 --> 00:56:37.300
Nothing, I just feel like
I'm in a fish tank.


506
00:56:37.383 --> 00:56:43.092
Honestly, right now one is enough.
We're barely managing with this one.


507
00:56:43.175 --> 00:56:46.675
What do you care?
Your wife has no job.


508
00:56:46.758 --> 00:56:48.592
I'm looking for one.

509
00:56:48.675 --> 00:56:50.758
Our expenses are high.

510
00:56:50.842 --> 00:56:54.217
And we want to send Lina
to a university abroad later.


511
00:56:54.300 --> 00:56:55.925
So she can come back with an infidel?

512
00:56:59.092 --> 00:57:01.967
- We laughed. Enough, now.
- Listen, listen.


513
00:57:02.050 --> 00:57:05.342
Did you hear about the scandal
at Huda's salon?


514
00:57:05.425 --> 00:57:08.133
Oh, right. I heard about it yesterday.

515
00:57:08.217 --> 00:57:12.883
Her exposure led to
at least a thousand traitors.


516
00:57:12.967 --> 00:57:15.925
- I'll get the coffee.
- How was she discovered?


517
00:57:16.008 --> 00:57:20.800
One of her victims committed suicide,
leaving an emotional letter.


518
00:57:20.883 --> 00:57:24.425
Every traitor will be exposed,
sooner or later.


519
00:57:33.592 --> 00:57:36.342
I just tried to help myself
as well as these girls.


520
00:57:36.425 --> 00:57:39.633
Helping them how?
By destroying their lives?


521
00:57:41.050 --> 00:57:46.008
You pretend you were
doing these girls a favor,


522
00:57:46.092 --> 00:57:51.217
when in reality you were stripping them
of their dignity and blackmailing them.


523
00:57:53.592 --> 00:57:55.675
Take a good look.

524
00:57:58.550 --> 00:58:00.883
You stripped them against their will.

525
00:58:01.633 --> 00:58:07.175
It's worse than rape. That is just once.
This extortion goes on forever.


526
00:58:08.925 --> 00:58:12.550
And what's worse,
you're playing the victim card.


527
00:58:13.800 --> 00:58:15.550
You're delusional.

528
00:58:17.717 --> 00:58:19.758
You can lie to me.

529
00:58:19.842 --> 00:58:23.008
- But to lie to yourself?
- You piece of shit.


530
00:58:23.092 --> 00:58:25.008
Who do you think you are?

531
00:58:25.092 --> 00:58:27.092
Who are you to judge me?

532
00:58:29.342 --> 00:58:34.008
Fine, I'm a piece of shit.
But what does that make you?


533
00:58:34.342 --> 00:58:36.800
Siham,
the latest research states


534
00:58:36.883 --> 00:58:40.217
that women who don't give birth,
keep their beauty.


535
00:58:40.300 --> 00:58:41.967
I know what I'm talking about.

536
00:58:42.050 --> 00:58:45.717
- I wish your mother had kept her beauty.
- What?


537
00:58:52.717 --> 00:58:54.342
Excuse me.

538
00:59:00.342 --> 00:59:02.217
She's joking, right?

539
00:59:05.133 --> 00:59:08.592
- Hello?
<i>- Don't hang up. Listen until the end.</i>


540
00:59:08.675 --> 00:59:12.633
<i>I want to help you.
If you help us find Huda's sons,</i>


541
00:59:12.717 --> 00:59:16.842
<i>I promise we'll wipe your slate clean.
This is the best we can offer you.</i>


542
00:59:26.092 --> 00:59:30.008
I'm not a traitor nor a snitch.
Please don't call again.


543
00:59:43.467 --> 00:59:46.717
- I told you not to call.
<i>- Wait, wait.</i>


544
00:59:46.800 --> 00:59:49.425
<i>Are you the one who visited
the salon yesterday?</i>


545
01:00:21.758 --> 01:00:23.633
What are you doing?

546
01:00:23.717 --> 01:00:25.133
Are you completely crazy?

547
01:00:28.467 --> 01:00:31.717
- Who keeps calling you?
- Nobody.


548
01:00:32.008 --> 01:00:33.342
059

549
01:00:34.050 --> 01:00:35.633
884

550
01:00:36.758 --> 01:00:38.175
5184.

551
01:00:40.217 --> 01:00:41.508
Take a look.

552
01:00:42.633 --> 01:00:44.842
This is in the south end of town.

553
01:00:44.925 --> 01:00:49.883
Zaki, Atef. Go with Isam.
Find the owner of this number.


554
01:00:50.717 --> 01:00:53.217
What kind of joke was that,
in front of my mother?


555
01:00:53.300 --> 01:00:56.342
'I wish your mother had kept her beauty?'
She left upset.


556
01:00:56.425 --> 01:00:59.717
I went above and beyond for them.
What else do you want from me?


557
01:00:59.800 --> 01:01:02.842
Reem, this is my family.
Not guests from Mexico.


558
01:01:02.925 --> 01:01:04.967
Should I put on a show for them?

559
01:01:05.050 --> 01:01:08.842
There's no pleasing your mother.
I can never do anything right.


560
01:01:08.925 --> 01:01:12.758
- Reem, please.
- So it's all my fault?


561
01:01:12.842 --> 01:01:16.633
I've been cooking all day
and you make out that I'm lazy.


562
01:01:16.717 --> 01:01:19.092
Why did you call me an infidel?

563
01:01:19.175 --> 01:01:22.675
Darling, that was a joke.
Reem. To make you less pouty.


564
01:01:22.758 --> 01:01:25.550
I know you too well, you meant it.

565
01:01:25.633 --> 01:01:28.758
When have you ever come home
and found no food on the table?


566
01:01:28.842 --> 01:01:31.425
Or a house that was not clean?

567
01:01:31.508 --> 01:01:33.967
As if this is just about
cooking and cleaning.


568
01:01:34.050 --> 01:01:38.467
- You've never said one nice thing to me.
- As if you're such a Romeo.


569
01:01:38.550 --> 01:01:42.925
All you ever say is, 'Where were you?
Who did you see, who drove you?'


570
01:01:43.008 --> 01:01:45.092
Here we go again.

571
01:01:45.175 --> 01:01:47.675
Reem, I have the right...
Reem, look at me.


572
01:01:47.758 --> 01:01:49.675
It's my right to know everything you do

573
01:01:49.758 --> 01:01:52.717
especially when I've never felt,
not once, that you love me.


574
01:01:52.800 --> 01:01:55.800
And your eyes are always wandering.

575
01:01:55.883 --> 01:01:58.467
My eyes?
Do you know why?


576
01:01:58.550 --> 01:02:00.842
Because my eyes stopped seeing
you as a man.


577
01:02:00.925 --> 01:02:02.842
A single word can flatten you.

578
01:02:02.925 --> 01:02:06.883
This is your grandma's house. I can't move
a chair without your mom's permission.


579
01:02:06.967 --> 01:02:09.633
Reem, you're going too far.

580
01:02:09.717 --> 01:02:12.092
You better hold that tongue of yours.

581
01:02:12.175 --> 01:02:14.883
I swear, Yousef, one more word
and I'm leaving this house.


582
01:02:15.675 --> 01:02:20.383
You are not giving up the names

583
01:02:20.467 --> 01:02:24.592
because you know you will die right after.

584
01:02:27.092 --> 01:02:31.300
If you think I'm stealing minutes,
you're wrong.


585
01:02:32.467 --> 01:02:36.092
I've been expecting this moment to come
for a long time.


586
01:02:36.175 --> 01:02:38.092
I'm ready.

587
01:02:38.175 --> 01:02:40.758
We both know you're a liar.

588
01:02:40.842 --> 01:02:43.633
If you are really so brave,

589
01:02:43.717 --> 01:02:48.217
then at least admit that you caused
a lot of pain to a lot of people...


590
01:02:49.633 --> 01:02:51.883
including these girls.

591
01:03:00.717 --> 01:03:02.717
It's just a matter of time
until we catch her.


592
01:03:02.800 --> 01:03:04.425
We've got her number.

593
01:03:06.967 --> 01:03:08.967
Do you have any idea
what will happen to her?


594
01:03:11.175 --> 01:03:14.717
- Take a left here.
- Are we getting close?


595
01:03:14.800 --> 01:03:17.592
- How accurate is this device?
- About a 50-meter radius.


596
01:03:21.342 --> 01:03:23.467
It should be easy.
There are just a few houses.


597
01:03:33.842 --> 01:03:38.758
If there's someone else in your life,
tell me. I can't deal with this anymore.


598
01:03:38.842 --> 01:03:41.592
Would you believe me if I said
there's no one else?


599
01:03:41.675 --> 01:03:44.175
Reem, love. Calm down.

600
01:03:46.675 --> 01:03:48.508
Tell me what's going on?

601
01:03:48.592 --> 01:03:50.175
What's going on?

602
01:03:50.258 --> 01:03:52.008
Would you believe me if I told you?

603
01:03:53.175 --> 01:03:55.800
Can I trust you if I told you?

604
01:03:59.258 --> 01:04:01.050
Yeah, I thought so.

605
01:04:11.300 --> 01:04:12.925
I'm listening.

606
01:04:14.675 --> 01:04:16.300
What's the deal?

607
01:04:18.717 --> 01:04:20.883
It's better for you not to know.

608
01:04:34.967 --> 01:04:38.592
You know what, Reem?
You're not the one leaving the house.


609
01:04:38.675 --> 01:04:40.175
I am.

610
01:04:47.758 --> 01:04:49.383
Enough!

611
01:04:51.217 --> 01:04:53.842
With your wit, you could have
saved those girls...


612
01:04:55.467 --> 01:04:58.758
and found yourself an escape route, too.

613
01:04:58.925 --> 01:05:00.300
You think so?

614
01:05:01.550 --> 01:05:06.800
Out of the frying pan into the fire.
What escape route are you talking about?


615
01:05:06.883 --> 01:05:08.508
You should have come to us.

616
01:05:09.342 --> 01:05:10.758
Just like Safaa?

617
01:05:12.342 --> 01:05:15.300
- So she snitched on me?
- How did you know?


618
01:05:15.383 --> 01:05:17.008
Her picture isn't here.

619
01:05:17.925 --> 01:05:22.508
Safaa is much better off
than you are right now.


620
01:05:22.592 --> 01:05:25.092
Really? In what way better?

621
01:05:25.175 --> 01:05:28.883
If you don't kill her,
the Secret Service will.


622
01:05:28.967 --> 01:05:32.592
No, Safaa committed suicide.

623
01:06:02.008 --> 01:06:04.758
I told you, I'm
all alone in the house.

624
01:06:04.842 --> 01:06:07.508
- Sorry to bother you.
- You're welcome.


625
01:07:45.258 --> 01:07:48.133
And what you did to your kids
is even worse.


626
01:07:48.217 --> 01:07:49.758
Tell me.

627
01:07:49.967 --> 01:07:52.425
How are Wajdi, Nabeel
and Karam doing?


628
01:07:56.550 --> 01:08:01.050
So now you've suddenly decided
to play good cop?


629
01:08:01.550 --> 01:08:03.092
They hate you, right?

630
01:08:05.258 --> 01:08:07.925
You claim their father forbade them
to see you.


631
01:08:08.842 --> 01:08:10.550
They're older now, though.

632
01:08:11.133 --> 01:08:16.300
They could have come looking for you.
Why haven't they?


633
01:08:16.382 --> 01:08:20.050
Their father made them hate me.

634
01:08:20.132 --> 01:08:23.342
Wrong.
It's because you're selfish.


635
01:08:24.425 --> 01:08:27.842
If you loved them in the first place,

636
01:08:27.925 --> 01:08:29.507
and cared for them,

637
01:08:29.592 --> 01:08:34.592
no force in the world could have
made them hate you.


638
01:08:36.757 --> 01:08:38.342
He took them away.

639
01:08:38.425 --> 01:08:41.007
They were not allowed to see me.

640
01:08:41.092 --> 01:08:43.467
I gave them all that I could.

641
01:08:43.550 --> 01:08:45.717
You're not the only victim in this world

642
01:08:45.800 --> 01:08:52.132
but you're the kind that uses it
to run away from your responsibility.


643
01:08:52.217 --> 01:08:54.050
Even towards your children.

644
01:08:54.132 --> 01:08:59.132
You'll die in an hour, while your kids
will hate you for the rest of their lives.


645
01:09:00.507 --> 01:09:02.925
Besides neglecting them,

646
01:09:03.007 --> 01:09:05.132
you've also brought
them nothing but shame.


647
01:09:06.342 --> 01:09:10.342
Did you know Wajdi, Nabeel
and Karam contacted us?


648
01:09:11.882 --> 01:09:13.592
No.

649
01:09:13.675 --> 01:09:16.425
Not to see if you were all right.

650
01:09:17.967 --> 01:09:20.717
Because they want to kill you themselves.

651
01:09:20.800 --> 01:09:23.632
To wash off the shame and the pain
you brought them.


652
01:10:33.633 --> 01:10:35.717
We want the names, Huda.

653
01:10:35.800 --> 01:10:39.342
Before they fall deeper into the clutches
of the Secret Service.


654
01:10:41.717 --> 01:10:43.675
<i>Hello?</i>

655
01:11:49.550 --> 01:11:55.008
We're looking for a young woman
with dark hair. We need to take a look.


656
01:12:28.175 --> 01:12:31.550
- Hello?
<i>- Hello? Who's this?</i>


657
01:12:31.633 --> 01:12:35.425
- Wrong number.
<i>- How's it wrong? You called me.</i>


658
01:12:35.508 --> 01:12:39.008
- It was a mistake.
<i>- No problem, have a good day.</i>


659
01:12:39.092 --> 01:12:43.842
- Wait, wait. Are you Musa?
<i>- Yes.</i>


660
01:12:46.008 --> 01:12:51.008
Huda gave me your number,
and they say she was caught.


661
01:12:51.092 --> 01:12:55.967
I'm banned from traveling abroad.
Could you get me a travel permit?


662
01:12:56.050 --> 01:12:58.467
I must leave today.

663
01:12:58.550 --> 01:13:01.508
<i>
- What's your name?</i>
- Reem.

664
01:13:01.592 --> 01:13:03.967
<i>Reem what?</i>

665
01:13:04.050 --> 01:13:07.217
- Could you?
<i>- Of course I can.</i>


666
01:13:07.300 --> 01:13:09.467
<i>Let me check your file.</i>

667
01:13:09.550 --> 01:13:14.008
- This is the first time I've called you.
<i>- So you don't have a file.</i>


668
01:13:14.092 --> 01:13:16.300
<i>Don't worry. 
You're in the clear.</i>

669
01:13:16.383 --> 01:13:22.342
But she took my photo
and if they find it, my life is over.


670
01:13:22.425 --> 01:13:26.300
- I have a daughter.
<i>- I understand, but I can't help you.</i>


671
01:13:26.383 --> 01:13:29.008
<i>You haven't helped us with anything.</i>

672
01:13:29.092 --> 01:13:33.217
<i>To protect you and your daughter,
we need information from you.</i>


673
01:13:33.300 --> 01:13:37.008
But they have my number.
They are going to find me.


674
01:13:37.092 --> 01:13:40.050
<i>I understand, but we're state-run.</i>

675
01:13:40.133 --> 01:13:44.258
<i>In order to help you, I need to
access a file and you don't have one.</i>


676
01:13:44.342 --> 01:13:47.342
<i>Give me any piece
of useful information...</i>


677
01:13:47.425 --> 01:13:49.425
I don't have any information.

678
01:13:49.508 --> 01:13:53.633
<i>Then pray that your photo doesn't
fall into the hands of the terrorists.</i>


679
01:13:58.883 --> 01:14:00.717
What kind of information do you want?

680
01:14:00.800 --> 01:14:03.758
<i>Let's start with you.
Who are you? How old are you?</i>


681
01:14:03.842 --> 01:14:06.008
<i>How old is your daughter?
Who's your husband?</i>


682
01:14:06.092 --> 01:14:07.883
Who are you talking to?

683
01:14:09.592 --> 01:14:12.092
Nobody. My mom.

684
01:14:12.175 --> 01:14:14.217
- Give me your phone.
- No. It's mine.


685
01:14:14.300 --> 01:14:15.508
- Give it to me.
- No.


686
01:14:15.592 --> 01:14:17.217
Give it.

687
01:14:25.467 --> 01:14:28.925
<i>
- Hello? Reem?</i>
- Who is this?

688
01:14:34.008 --> 01:14:35.675
Who was that?

689
01:14:37.467 --> 01:14:39.050
Where is Lina's basket?

690
01:14:39.133 --> 01:14:40.925
- Yousef, listen.
- Reem, get away from me.


691
01:14:41.008 --> 01:14:43.008
Yousef, just listen to me.

692
01:14:43.092 --> 01:14:45.300
I'm in trouble
and I need you to stand by me.


693
01:14:48.633 --> 01:14:51.717
It's not someone else.
That man is named Musa.


694
01:14:51.800 --> 01:14:55.425
I needed his help.
If you don't believe me, call him.


695
01:14:58.675 --> 01:15:00.092
Help with what?

696
01:15:01.050 --> 01:15:02.883
This is bigger than having someone else.

697
01:15:04.758 --> 01:15:07.342
Everyone is going to think that...

698
01:15:08.508 --> 01:15:10.258
It's Huda.

699
01:15:18.717 --> 01:15:23.592
Yesterday, I was at Huda's salon
and she drugged me...


700
01:15:29.633 --> 01:15:31.508
Huda's salon?

701
01:15:36.758 --> 01:15:39.717
If the resistance find my photo,
my life's over.


702
01:15:39.800 --> 01:15:43.842
I couldn't tell you.
I wasn't sure if you would stand by me...


703
01:15:46.425 --> 01:15:48.050
Yousef.

704
01:15:48.717 --> 01:15:51.633
If we want to protect Lina,
we have to leave this country.


705
01:15:59.675 --> 01:16:01.300
Yousef?

706
01:16:07.050 --> 01:16:09.425
Yousef, what are you going to do?

707
01:16:09.508 --> 01:16:12.050
Where are you going?
Wait. Wait.


708
01:16:15.633 --> 01:16:17.467
Yousef, just listen to me.

709
01:16:19.925 --> 01:16:22.925
To protect Lina,
we have to get away from you.


710
01:16:24.508 --> 01:16:27.342
And you need to find a way
to clear your name.


711
01:16:30.967 --> 01:16:32.800
I knew it.

712
01:16:34.925 --> 01:16:37.717
Go. You're nothing to me.

713
01:17:05.967 --> 01:17:08.842
The phone is moving
and I just saw a guy leaving in his car.


714
01:20:26.050 --> 01:20:29.133
<i>Reem, listen carefully. 
I will help you.</i>

715
01:20:29.217 --> 01:20:32.800
<i>But pay attention.
You have to do exactly what I tell you.</i>


716
01:20:32.883 --> 01:20:35.758
<i>Don't mess about
with the Secret Service.</i>


717
01:20:35.842 --> 01:20:42.550
<i>In 30 minutes, call the guy calling you.
Tell him to come pick you up. Okay?</i>


718
01:20:43.550 --> 01:20:46.550
Who should they fear more?
Us or the Secret Service?


719
01:20:47.383 --> 01:20:49.633
I honestly don't know.

720
01:20:50.550 --> 01:20:52.592
But I hope you're a good man.

721
01:20:53.675 --> 01:20:55.300
Are you?

722
01:21:10.342 --> 01:21:12.592
Promise me your guys
won't hurt those girls.


723
01:21:13.842 --> 01:21:18.175
Of course they won't.
They'll lead us to their handlers.


724
01:21:19.925 --> 01:21:22.383
Let them help you find Musa.

725
01:21:33.217 --> 01:21:35.008
Sanaa Ali Rabeh.

726
01:22:32.133 --> 01:22:34.508
<i>
- Hello?</i>
- Listen.

727
01:22:34.592 --> 01:22:38.633
- Come and get me now.
<i>- So you've changed your mind?</i>


728
01:22:38.717 --> 01:22:42.967
- I'm ready to face the consequences.
<i>- Give me your address then.</i>


729
01:22:44.050 --> 01:22:47.633
Bustan Al-Beik.
And you'll need to break the door open.


730
01:22:52.258 --> 01:22:55.258
Strange. She wants us
to break down the door.


731
01:22:55.342 --> 01:22:59.258
- Shall I go get her?
- It could be a setup.


732
01:22:59.342 --> 01:23:01.258
Shall I just watch the house?

733
01:23:01.342 --> 01:23:04.508
- Be careful. Go.
- Okay.


734
01:23:08.217 --> 01:23:10.050
Hassan?

735
01:23:12.133 --> 01:23:14.217
Did my sons really contact you?

736
01:23:16.758 --> 01:23:18.175
No.

737
01:23:21.508 --> 01:23:23.133
I'm sorry.

738
01:23:28.092 --> 01:23:31.300
- I have one last request.
- Sure.


739
01:23:31.383 --> 01:23:33.217
I don't want to be tortured to death.

740
01:23:34.550 --> 01:23:36.300
Can I be shot?

741
01:23:36.383 --> 01:23:37.758
And not in my face?

742
01:23:39.300 --> 01:23:41.133
I will respect that.

743
01:23:44.925 --> 01:23:49.883
Either way, no one will retain
a good image of you.


744
01:23:51.300 --> 01:23:53.300
I just hope you will.

745
01:23:58.050 --> 01:24:00.633
If I spared your life...

746
01:24:02.550 --> 01:24:04.175
what would you do?

747
01:24:12.258 --> 01:24:14.258
What happened to Reem?

748
01:24:15.300 --> 01:24:18.592
My guys are interrogating her husband.

749
01:24:18.675 --> 01:24:22.133
She really is innocent.
She never did anything wrong.


750
01:24:22.217 --> 01:24:23.925
Believe me.

751
01:24:24.008 --> 01:24:27.383
Why is she so important to you?
Why her?


752
01:24:29.300 --> 01:24:31.675
I see myself in her.

753
01:25:17.342 --> 01:25:19.175
Not in her head.

754
01:26:01.175 --> 01:26:04.883
<i>This is Hassan speaking.
Your husband is safe with us.</i>


755
01:26:04.967 --> 01:26:08.383
- And my daughter?
<i>- Your daughter, too.</i>


756
01:26:08.467 --> 01:26:13.008
<i>Listen, we need you to help us
get to Musa.</i>


757
01:26:14.675 --> 01:26:17.050
<i>
- Do you hear me?</i>
- Why? What happened?

758
01:26:17.133 --> 01:26:21.842
<i>Don't worry, we know you're innocent.
