597
00:29:18.691 --> 00:29:19.692
[Xan yells]

598
00:29:19.775 --> 00:29:23.404
[Darryl] Xan down.
Oh yeah. That was the winner.


599
00:29:23.529 --> 00:29:24.738
[Tempest] We need to see that again.

600
00:29:24.822 --> 00:29:26.740
[Darryl] You get extra points for
tripping.


601
00:29:27.074 --> 00:29:31.161
Because everybody in every
horror film dies when they trip.


602
00:29:31.245 --> 00:29:33.497
[sinister laugh]

603
00:29:33.581 --> 00:29:36.709
Another one down.
Well done, everybody.


604
00:29:36.792 --> 00:29:40.879
So, your scare scores for this
zone are added to the last.


605
00:29:40.963 --> 00:29:45.926
Now hopefully, you can keep them down
heading into our final zone.


606
00:29:46.010 --> 00:29:51.890
And most infernal zone. Remember the team
with the lowest score leads.


607
00:29:51.974 --> 00:29:57.980
Jaleel and Chris, [laughs] we only picked
up nine screams in the carnival.


608
00:29:58.063 --> 00:30:02.484
But you were closing your eyes like
practically the whole time.


609
00:30:02.901 --> 00:30:08.282
And, you ran like hell when
that chainsaw came after you.


610
00:30:08.824 --> 00:30:11.327
Your scare score is 17.

611
00:30:11.410 --> 00:30:13.537
- We're 17. That's under twenties.
- That's what's up.


612
00:30:13.621 --> 00:30:15.706
- [laughter]
- [Chris] That's under 20.


613
00:30:15.789 --> 00:30:18.751
- [Tempest] It ain't 18.
- Just so you know, it's under 20.


614
00:30:18.834 --> 00:30:23.297
Now Shoniqua and Javalan,
you screamed ten times


615
00:30:23.380 --> 00:30:28.302
on top of getting alien juice in your eye,
and dropping an alien.


616
00:30:28.385 --> 00:30:31.221
You flew outta there
like E.T. on a bicycle.


617
00:30:31.305 --> 00:30:32.139
[Javalan] You did, you did.

618
00:30:32.473 --> 00:30:36.060
[Darryl] But your score for this zone is

619
00:30:36.310 --> 00:30:37.895
- [Chris] Oh, did you run?
- [Jaleel] Oh, you ran.


620
00:30:37.978 --> 00:30:39.229
- [Chris] Oh you ran.
- [Jaleel] Oh, you ran.


621
00:30:39.313 --> 00:30:43.108
You ran. That's what got you in the
twenties. Listen, we're sub...


622
00:30:43.192 --> 00:30:49.865
Xan and Karma. You screamed 14 times.
And you fell.


623
00:30:49.948 --> 00:30:51.408
- [Xan screams]
- Oh I did, yeah.


624
00:30:51.492 --> 00:30:53.410
- [Tempest] To the floor.
- [contestants laugh]


625
00:30:53.494 --> 00:30:56.413
- [Darryl] You remember that part?
- Like his knee touched the ground?


626
00:30:56.497 --> 00:30:58.290
- [Lil Xan] Yes. Yeah.
- [Tempest] Like hard.


627
00:30:58.374 --> 00:31:03.629
We had to add some points for that
along with a number of other things.


628
00:31:03.712 --> 00:31:07.800
Your score for this zone is 23.

629
00:31:07.883 --> 00:31:12.971
- [Xan and Karma cheer]
- [contestants laugh]


630
00:31:13.722 --> 00:31:17.434
[Darryl] Shoniqua, you and Javalan
got knocked down to second.


631
00:31:17.518 --> 00:31:20.562
Jaleel, you and Chris
managed to take the lead.


632
00:31:21.146 --> 00:31:25.651
And then Xan, you and Karma are losing
gratuitous amounts blood.


633
00:31:25.734 --> 00:31:27.569
Look, I'm surprised both
of y'all still standing.


634
00:31:27.653 --> 00:31:28.862
What if we get zero points?

635
00:31:28.946 --> 00:31:32.449
- It's okay.
- You can always rise from the dead.


636
00:31:32.825 --> 00:31:35.160
- [Karma] Right, right.
- [Tempest] That's true.


637
00:31:36.453 --> 00:31:38.122
[screams]

638
00:31:38.205 --> 00:31:42.960
It's still anybody's haunt.
In our final zone, anything can happen.


639
00:31:43.377 --> 00:31:48.382
[Darryl] We have saved our most
skin crawling zone for last.


640
00:31:48.507 --> 00:31:51.468
Welcome to Sundown Manor.

641

- [wolf howling]
- [sinister laugh]


642
00:31:57.015 --> 00:32:01.019
[Narrator] In our final zone,
teams are greeted by the devil himself.


643
00:32:03.814 --> 00:32:07.234
Before entering the shocking
electrocution chamber.


644
00:32:08.485 --> 00:32:10.404
Then they'll make their
way to the dining room


645
00:32:10.487 --> 00:32:13.115
where the party is just getting started.

646
00:32:13.198 --> 00:32:17.077
[monster] It's party time.
[high pitched laugh]


647
00:32:17.161 --> 00:32:21.707
[Narrator] Next, they must duck down
into a fright-filled freezer,


648
00:32:21.790 --> 00:32:24.752
which leads to a demonic dollhouse.

649
00:32:25.627 --> 00:32:28.213
And then a Garden of Gore.

650
00:32:28.797 --> 00:32:33.260
And last, but not least
is the Field of Screams,


651
00:32:33.343 --> 00:32:36.680
where terror comes from all directions.

652
00:32:37.181 --> 00:32:39.808
[screaming]

653
00:32:40.726 --> 00:32:44.813
First up, is Xan and Karma,

654
00:32:45.147 --> 00:32:49.318
who currently sit in copious amounts of
blood, in last place.


655
00:32:49.401 --> 00:32:51.445
[Darryl] Now, it's time to show what you
made of. Let's do it.


656
00:32:51.528 --> 00:32:52.613
[Chris] Try not to fall down this time.

657
00:32:52.696 --> 00:32:53.739
Don't slip.

658
00:32:53.822 --> 00:32:56.241
I think that tonight, to be honest,

659
00:32:56.325 --> 00:32:59.119
I really think you are gonna be the more
scared one out of both of us.


660
00:32:59.203 --> 00:33:01.163
- We'll see. We'll see about that.
- I do.


661
00:33:01.246 --> 00:33:04.082
The last time I got scared,
my toothbrush fell in the toilet


662
00:33:04.208 --> 00:33:05.793
and I was like, man, this sucks.

663
00:33:06.418 --> 00:33:07.753
- All right, come on.
- No closing your eyes.

Yo, this one's for the money.

blink, don't even blink.

looking. She's not looking.
