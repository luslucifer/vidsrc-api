1
00:00:26.168 --> 00:00:27.283
Do you think it's
gonna sell out?


2
00:00:27.307 --> 00:00:28.688
What?

3
00:00:28.757 --> 00:00:33.313
Fright Fest.

4
00:00:33.382 --> 00:00:36.074
Well, which movie
looked best to you?


5
00:00:36.143 --> 00:00:38.283
Uhm, I don't know.

6
00:00:38.352 --> 00:00:40.113
Well, there Kamarimanku.

7
00:00:40.182 --> 00:00:41.562
There's Camp Blood.

8
00:00:41.632 --> 00:00:43.841
Full Moon Silver Bullet.

9
00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:45.912
Or Bride of the Living Dead.

10
00:00:45.981 --> 00:00:49.778
The horror movie.

11
00:00:49.847 --> 00:00:53.989
Two, please.

12
00:00:54.058 --> 00:01:01.686
Fright Fest!

13
00:01:01.755 --> 00:01:03.635
Alright, so you have to
have an opinion on this.


14
00:01:03.688 --> 00:01:06.242
Fast zombies or slow zombies?

15
00:01:06.311 --> 00:01:10.177
I don't know, fast?

16
00:01:10.246 --> 00:01:12.801
No, fast zombies are
a total abomination.


17
00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:14.457
You lose all nuance.

18
00:01:14.526 --> 00:01:17.426
If you think about it, zombies
are the total metaphor for...


19
00:01:17.495 --> 00:01:19.186
So we're locked
in here all night?


20
00:01:19.254 --> 00:01:22.776
Yeah, if you can handle it.

21
00:01:22.845 --> 00:01:24.778
Greetings my bloody talon.

22
00:01:24.847 --> 00:01:26.573
Welcome to Fright Fest.

23
00:01:35.202 --> 00:01:37.377
I have hand picked
four tremulous tales


24
00:01:37.446 --> 00:01:39.828
to invade your
cinemaplex tonight.


25
00:01:39.897 --> 00:01:41.587
These four distinct
tastes of terror


26
00:01:41.657 --> 00:01:44.833
will run throughout the night.

27
00:01:44.902 --> 00:01:46.835
If the first taste isn't enough,

28
00:01:46.904 --> 00:01:51.046
go back for seconds,
thirds, fourths.


29
00:01:51.115 --> 00:01:53.427
This is a buffet of blood.

30
00:01:53.496 --> 00:01:56.016
Gorge yourself on gore!

31
00:01:56.085 --> 00:02:00.365
But, it's not for
the faint of heart.


32
00:02:00.434 --> 00:02:02.713
At any point you find
the horrors too much,


33
00:02:02.782 --> 00:02:06.164
you'll find a chicken exit
located just left of the screen.


34
00:02:29.912 --> 00:02:33.502
Darach?

35
00:02:33.571 --> 00:02:35.020
Darach?

36
00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:37.368
Christ, Sarah, what?

37
00:02:37.437 --> 00:02:38.749
I heard something downstairs.

38
00:02:38.818 --> 00:02:41.371
Chicken exit, really?

39
00:02:41.441 --> 00:02:44.478
I have never taken
the chicken exit.


40
00:02:44.547 --> 00:02:49.068
Wow, you must be so proud.

41
00:02:49.138 --> 00:02:50.657
Go back to sleep, it's the rock.

42
00:02:50.726 --> 00:02:52.555
No, Darach.

43
00:02:52.624 --> 00:02:53.729
Darach!

44
00:02:53.798 --> 00:02:57.008
Please, go back to sleep.

45
00:02:57.077 --> 00:03:00.253
I have a massive headache.

46
00:03:00.322 --> 00:03:02.531
Turn off the bloody light.

47
00:05:00.131 --> 00:05:01.167
Darach?

48
00:05:57.568 --> 00:05:59.018
Sarah?

49
00:05:59.087 --> 00:06:00.916
I'm inspector O'Connor.

50
00:06:00.985 --> 00:06:02.435
Yes?

51
00:06:02.504 --> 00:06:04.437
I was hoping to ask
Sarah some questions.


52
00:06:04.506 --> 00:06:06.094
She already explained everything

53
00:06:06.163 --> 00:06:09.062
to the other police officers.

54
00:06:09.131 --> 00:06:14.619
Yes.

55
00:06:14.688 --> 00:06:18.485
Sarah, I was told that you
heard someone in the room


56
00:06:18.554 --> 00:06:21.557
with your husband
before you found him.


57
00:06:21.626 --> 00:06:25.596
A scream?

58
00:06:25.665 --> 00:06:29.324
It was a woman, wailing.

59
00:06:29.393 --> 00:06:36.572
Like a, something like nails
on a chalkboard or something.


60
00:06:36.641 --> 00:06:39.092
This noise,
it came from the bedroom?


61
00:06:39.161 --> 00:06:41.094
Yeah.

62
00:06:41.163 --> 00:06:43.476
Did you see this woman?

63
00:06:43.545 --> 00:06:46.099
She wasn't in there.

64
00:06:46.168 --> 00:06:50.931
Did you see anyone entering
or leaving the house?


65
00:06:51.001 --> 00:06:53.313
No.

66
00:06:53.382 --> 00:06:57.628
You think I'm crazy.

67
00:06:57.697 --> 00:06:59.664
I believe you heard something,

68
00:06:59.733 --> 00:07:04.117
but events like this
can cloud your mind.


69
00:07:04.186 --> 00:07:06.326
These bottles, they
from last night?


70
00:07:06.395 --> 00:07:09.812
Yeah, that's enough,
leave us, please.


71
00:07:09.881 --> 00:07:12.850
She needs to rest.

72
00:07:12.919 --> 00:07:15.887
Look, I'll call you if we
find out anything unusual


73
00:07:15.956 --> 00:07:18.028
about your husband's death,

74
00:07:18.097 --> 00:07:22.032
and we'll get that comb
you found analyzed.


75
00:07:22.101 --> 00:07:24.965
If you think of
anything, call me.


76
00:07:39.394 --> 00:07:43.156
Hey, I made you some tea,

77
00:07:43.225 --> 00:07:46.642
and cleaned a little.

78
00:07:46.711 --> 00:07:49.438
Did you get rest last night?

79
00:07:49.507 --> 00:07:51.647
A bit.

80
00:07:51.716 --> 00:07:52.786
Good.

81
00:08:00.449 --> 00:08:03.832
Sarah, why don't you come
and stay with us for a while?


82
00:08:03.901 --> 00:08:09.079
I think being amongst people
in the city will do you good.


83
00:08:09.148 --> 00:08:13.566
Thanks, but I think
I need some time alone.


84
00:08:13.635 --> 00:08:15.015
Okay.

85
00:08:30.100 --> 00:08:31.721
You know, last
night I kept thinking


86
00:08:31.791 --> 00:08:37.728
about something that
happened a few days ago.


87
00:08:37.797 --> 00:08:42.595
Darach came back from the walking
the fields a few days ago,


88
00:08:42.663 --> 00:08:46.219
and he was...

89
00:08:46.288 --> 00:08:51.051
Drunk out of his
mind, but terrified.


90
00:08:51.121 --> 00:08:54.641
He said he saw a
woman there screaming,


91
00:08:54.710 --> 00:08:58.162
then she disappeared.

92
00:08:58.231 --> 00:09:02.132
And that it was some ghost
that haunts his family


93
00:09:02.201 --> 00:09:04.375
or something...

94
00:09:04.444 --> 00:09:06.066
Banshee.

95
00:09:06.136 --> 00:09:07.620
You know it?

96
00:09:07.689 --> 00:09:12.072
It's a story my mom
told me as a child.


97
00:09:12.142 --> 00:09:14.144
Well, what is it?

98
00:09:14.213 --> 00:09:16.318
It's a kid's story.

99
00:09:16.387 --> 00:09:17.802
Tell me.

100
00:09:17.871 --> 00:09:22.152
Well...

101
00:09:22.221 --> 00:09:26.156
There's this legend about
a woman called a banshee,


102
00:09:26.225 --> 00:09:29.504
who would haunt some
of the Irish families.


103
00:09:29.573 --> 00:09:32.334
And she would wait
forever in the field


104
00:09:32.403 --> 00:09:35.441
for her husband to
return from the sea.


105
00:09:35.510 --> 00:09:38.754
Well, according to the legend,

106
00:09:38.823 --> 00:09:41.274
people who would hear her wail,

107
00:09:41.343 --> 00:09:44.519
would have a family
member die that night.


108
00:09:44.588 --> 00:09:49.420
And people who saw her
would die themselves.


109
00:09:49.489 --> 00:09:52.112
Darach would have
seen this banshee.


110
00:09:52.182 --> 00:09:55.046
No, Sarah, it's a ghost story.

111
00:09:55.115 --> 00:09:57.497
There's no such
thing as a banshee.


112
00:09:57.566 --> 00:09:59.775
Well, then what do
you think what I heard?


113
00:09:59.844 --> 00:10:01.121
You said you heard a rumble.

114
00:10:01.191 --> 00:10:02.295
And a scream!

115
00:10:02.364 --> 00:10:05.264
It could have been Darach.

116
00:10:05.333 --> 00:10:07.266
He had a heart attack.

117
00:10:07.335 --> 00:10:08.267
He was only 29.

118
00:10:08.336 --> 00:10:14.307
And an alcoholic.

119
00:10:14.376 --> 00:10:15.515
Out.

120
00:10:15.584 --> 00:10:16.309
Look, Sarah...

121
00:10:16.378 --> 00:10:17.759
Please leave.

122
00:12:27.026 --> 00:12:29.511
This is where you saw her?

123
00:12:29.580 --> 00:12:31.962
Right there.

124
00:12:32.031 --> 00:12:34.240
Did you get a good look at her?

125
00:12:34.309 --> 00:12:36.138
She was quite far away,

126
00:12:36.207 --> 00:12:42.973
but she had a white dress
covered in blood and long hair.


127
00:12:43.042 --> 00:12:46.286
She just disappeared?

128
00:12:46.356 --> 00:12:50.429
I know how it sounds, but
you should know what I saw.


129
00:12:50.498 --> 00:12:58.091
Sarah, I wanna
believe you, but...


130
00:12:58.160 --> 00:13:03.165
You know about the banshee?

131
00:13:03.234 --> 00:13:05.236
Yes.

132
00:13:05.305 --> 00:13:09.102
When I got the call
about your husband,


133
00:13:09.171 --> 00:13:11.346
about the scream you heard,

134
00:13:11.415 --> 00:13:14.694
I've heard about that before.

135
00:13:14.763 --> 00:13:16.627
Long time ago.

136
00:13:16.696 --> 00:13:20.010
When I was a boy, my
father claimed our family


137
00:13:20.079 --> 00:13:22.840
was one of the Irish
families cursed


138
00:13:22.909 --> 00:13:27.638
by a pagan witch, the banshee.

139
00:13:27.707 --> 00:13:30.400
My father said he heard the wail

140
00:13:30.469 --> 00:13:33.333
the night before my
uncle passed away.


141
00:13:33.403 --> 00:13:37.579
I thought he was mad.

142
00:13:37.648 --> 00:13:40.548
And uh...

143
00:13:40.617 --> 00:13:43.482
Do you believe me?

144
00:13:43.551 --> 00:13:46.899
I don't know what I believe.

145
00:13:46.968 --> 00:13:49.660
We'll do some research
into the banshee.


146
00:13:49.729 --> 00:13:52.145
It's all I can promise for now.

147
00:13:52.214 --> 00:13:56.564
Thanks.

148
00:13:56.633 --> 00:14:00.188
And did you find
anything on the comb?


149
00:14:00.257 --> 00:14:05.435
Nothing.

150
00:14:08.576 --> 00:14:10.578
Sarah, are you alright?

151
00:14:10.647 --> 00:14:12.683
Yeah, just some sleep.

152
00:19:05.044 --> 00:19:06.080
Sarah?

153
00:19:06.149 --> 00:19:09.359
It's Inspector O'Connor.

154
00:19:09.428 --> 00:19:11.292
I think the
banshee's in the house.


155
00:19:11.361 --> 00:19:12.362
What?

156
00:19:12.431 --> 00:19:13.708
I'm on my way, listen.

157
00:19:13.777 --> 00:19:16.746
I did some research on the
banshee, you need to hear this.


158
00:19:16.815 --> 00:19:18.678
Apparently, the legend
is based on a woman


159
00:19:18.748 --> 00:19:22.234
who lived in the 1600s, who
was nicknamed the Banshee.


160
00:19:22.303 --> 00:19:24.754
She sacrificed her
husband in some ritual


161
00:19:24.823 --> 00:19:27.239
and claimed he went off to sea.

162
00:19:27.308 --> 00:19:30.690
What happened to her?

163
00:19:30.760 --> 00:19:32.865
The villagers
found her blood stained dress.


164
00:19:32.934 --> 00:19:35.385
She was burned at
the stake as a witch.


165
00:19:35.454 --> 00:19:37.663
The villagers believed
she imprinted her evil


166
00:19:37.732 --> 00:19:40.424
in her silver comb.

167
00:19:40.493 --> 00:19:43.531
Sarah, there's more.

168
00:19:43.600 --> 00:19:44.670
It's not what you think.

169
00:19:48.156 --> 00:19:50.400
Sarah?

170
00:19:50.469 --> 00:19:53.230
Sarah?

171
00:20:11.973 --> 00:20:13.906
Sarah, what's going on?

172
00:20:44.730 --> 00:20:45.800
Sarah?

173
00:20:54.844 --> 00:20:58.192
Sarah?

174
00:20:58.261 --> 00:21:03.853
She's gone.

175
00:21:03.922 --> 00:21:08.823
Sarah, are you alright?

176
00:21:08.892 --> 00:21:10.273
She's gone.

177
00:21:10.342 --> 00:21:13.483
I defeated her, I
burned her comb.


178
00:21:13.552 --> 00:21:16.106
Sarah, what comb?

179
00:21:16.175 --> 00:21:19.972
Comb.

180
00:21:20.041 --> 00:21:22.837
I wanted to tell
you on the phone.


181
00:21:22.906 --> 00:21:25.805
The story about the
witch, the banshee...


182
00:21:25.875 --> 00:21:28.808
They're not real.

183
00:21:28.878 --> 00:21:31.673
I saw her in the house.

184
00:21:31.742 --> 00:21:34.331
- Sarah...
- She...


185
00:21:34.400 --> 00:21:38.197
It's a delusion.

186
00:21:38.266 --> 00:21:40.959
She's not real?

187
00:21:41.028 --> 00:21:43.823
These stories about
fairies and witches,


188
00:21:43.893 --> 00:21:47.310
they're just inspiration
for your mind.


189
00:21:47.379 --> 00:21:49.415
People have been telling stories

190
00:21:49.484 --> 00:21:53.247
about the banshee
since the 1600s.


191
00:21:53.316 --> 00:21:55.076
But it's all in your mind.

192
00:21:55.145 --> 00:21:58.562
I don't understand.

193
00:21:58.631 --> 00:22:02.981
Sarah, you're not well.

194
00:22:03.050 --> 00:22:06.501
The banshee is a
warning from your body.


195
00:22:12.783 --> 00:22:19.549
Come on, let me make
you a cup of tea.


196
00:22:19.618 --> 00:22:22.655
No, I think that
I need some rest.


197
00:25:00.641 --> 00:25:05.197
This sucks, I'm leaving!

198
00:25:05.266 --> 00:25:07.924
Really?

199
00:25:07.993 --> 00:25:10.202
Right at the good part, too.

200
00:25:19.660 --> 00:25:24.768
Shit!

201
00:25:24.837 --> 00:25:27.909
Come on, Frankie, get
it together, Jesus.


202
00:25:27.978 --> 00:25:29.670
Hey, you alright?

203
00:25:29.739 --> 00:25:32.397
Yup, I'm fine.

204
00:25:32.466 --> 00:25:36.194
What happened, you get spooked?

205
00:25:36.263 --> 00:25:39.921
I mean, you could have left.

206
00:25:39.990 --> 00:25:42.579
Remember the whole chicken exit?

207
00:25:42.648 --> 00:25:45.134
You're my ride.

208
00:25:45.203 --> 00:25:48.413
I'm fine, what's next?

209
00:25:48.482 --> 00:25:52.141
Full Moon just
started in theater five?


210
00:25:52.210 --> 00:25:55.385
Perfect!

211
00:25:55.454 --> 00:25:58.423
Alright.

212
00:26:06.741 --> 00:26:08.329
You guys are
always at the same night.


213
00:26:08.398 --> 00:26:12.609
What, alright!

214
00:26:12.678 --> 00:26:18.097
Two for two,
okay, here you go, thank you.


215
00:26:18.167 --> 00:26:19.271
One, please.

216
00:26:19.340 --> 00:26:22.171
Hi Sir, one,
alright, there you go.


217
00:26:22.240 --> 00:26:25.139
Alright all the way to the left.

218
00:26:29.592 --> 00:26:30.938
Hey sir, how can I help you?

219
00:26:32.215 --> 00:26:33.215
There you go.

220
00:26:34.321 --> 00:26:38.187
Use the door right down there.

221
00:26:38.256 --> 00:26:39.509
Hi, what can I do for you...
One, please.


222
00:26:39.533 --> 00:26:43.847
One, gotcha,
there you go, enjoy your show.


223
00:26:43.916 --> 00:26:45.849
One, please.

224
00:26:45.918 --> 00:26:48.818
Sorry kid, it's a private
screening, invitation only.


225
00:26:48.887 --> 00:26:52.684
I have a note from my dad.

226
00:26:52.753 --> 00:26:55.065
Cute kid, but I
can't let you in.


227
00:26:55.134 --> 00:26:56.905
Come back tomorrow for
the screening of frozen.


228
00:26:56.929 --> 00:26:59.208
The horror movie
on the ski slope?


229
00:26:59.277 --> 00:27:00.312
No.

230
00:27:18.606 --> 00:27:22.300
Enjoy the show!

231
00:27:22.369 --> 00:27:23.749
For you, Sir?

232
00:27:23.818 --> 00:27:26.269
I'd like a rack of
ribs and some chicken.


233
00:27:26.338 --> 00:27:29.341
Okay, we just ran out of ribs,
but I can bring that chicken


234
00:27:29.410 --> 00:27:33.242
out to you in about a minute.

235
00:27:33.311 --> 00:27:34.864
And for you, Sir?

236
00:27:34.933 --> 00:27:37.038
Skittles.

237
00:27:37.107 --> 00:27:39.178
There's a back door over here.

238
00:27:39.248 --> 00:27:41.871
Come on, Brandy, you really
wanna see a crappy movie?


239
00:27:41.940 --> 00:27:43.769
You're both chickenshits.

240
00:27:43.838 --> 00:27:46.047
I'm missing Vampire Diaries.

241
00:27:46.116 --> 00:27:47.290
Here it is!

242
00:28:01.442 --> 00:28:03.242
Shouldn't you be minding
the concession stand?


243
00:28:03.272 --> 00:28:04.963
We just ran out of meat!

244
00:28:05.032 --> 00:28:06.102
Did you check the freezer?

245
00:28:06.171 --> 00:28:07.379
Of course, I did!

246
00:28:07.448 --> 00:28:10.348
We're out, I'm telling
you, it's gone!


247
00:28:10.417 --> 00:28:11.349
10 minutes to sundown.

248
00:28:11.418 --> 00:28:13.592
I know, and I'm starving!

249
00:28:13.661 --> 00:28:15.767
I told you to eat
before you got here!


250
00:28:15.836 --> 00:28:21.013
I've got a litter to feed!

251
00:28:28.158 --> 00:28:29.263
Ah!

252
00:28:29.332 --> 00:28:30.195
What?

253
00:28:30.264 --> 00:28:36.615
Ah, just that looks amazing!

254
00:28:39.342 --> 00:28:40.930
See ya, losers!

255
00:28:52.562 --> 00:28:54.253
And let's lock her up.

256
00:28:59.949 --> 00:29:02.434
Hey, let us in!

257
00:29:02.503 --> 00:29:04.125
Later losers!

258
00:29:04.194 --> 00:29:05.989
You suck and I
hope you get caught!


259
00:29:06.058 --> 00:29:10.235
Dad will get her out
of trouble, he always does.


260
00:29:19.693 --> 00:29:21.142
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome!

261
00:29:22.143 --> 00:29:24.042
Welcome to oh, hey, hey, hey!

262
00:29:24.111 --> 00:29:25.492
We're thrilled to
have you with us!


263
00:29:25.561 --> 00:29:28.460
Before us the famous
cult classic film,


264
00:29:28.529 --> 00:29:30.842
Foaming at the Mouth Part Two.

265
00:29:30.911 --> 00:29:33.292
Also on behalf of
myself and my staff,


266
00:29:33.362 --> 00:29:36.330
I would like to apologize
for the shortage of food;


267
00:29:36.399 --> 00:29:38.090
however, we are
working diligently


268
00:29:38.159 --> 00:29:40.161
to get the problem resolved.

269
00:29:40.230 --> 00:29:42.129
In the meantime,

270
00:29:42.198 --> 00:29:45.201
the uncontrollable urge
to tear, claw or gnaw,


271
00:29:45.270 --> 00:29:47.168
please feel free to ask one

272
00:29:47.237 --> 00:29:49.861
of my lovely ushers
for a muzzle.


273
00:29:51.241 --> 00:29:53.451
We want meat!

274
00:29:53.520 --> 00:29:54.945
Okay, Sir, Sir,
we're doing everything


275
00:29:54.969 --> 00:29:56.281
we can to accommodate you.

276
00:29:56.350 --> 00:29:58.041
Bullshit!

277
00:29:58.110 --> 00:30:00.112
Yeah, let's get
those lights down.


278
00:30:00.181 --> 00:30:01.355
Enjoy your movie.

279
00:30:02.460 --> 00:30:09.156
Get outta here!

280
00:30:13.471 --> 00:30:16.232
Get away from me,
please get away from me!


281
00:30:16.301 --> 00:30:17.544
Please help me!

282
00:31:05.488 --> 00:31:09.941
Going somewhere, little girl?

283
00:31:12.668 --> 00:31:15.429
I remember you.

284
00:31:15.498 --> 00:31:18.570
Give her to me.

285
00:31:24.024 --> 00:31:27.717
Now to be fair we'll
have to raffle her off.


286
00:31:27.786 --> 00:31:29.547
Everyone check
their ticket stubs


287
00:31:29.616 --> 00:31:31.065
and let's get some numbers!

288
00:31:31.134 --> 00:31:32.895
Think she's got
enough meat on her


289
00:31:32.964 --> 00:31:34.483
for the four lucky winners!

290
00:31:38.176 --> 00:31:40.558
Don't worry, it won't hurt bad.

291
00:31:40.627 --> 00:31:41.627
What's your name?

292
00:31:41.662 --> 00:31:42.905
Brianne.

293
00:31:42.974 --> 00:31:45.390
Oh, Brianne, you
picked the wrong night


294
00:31:45.459 --> 00:31:47.392
to sneak into the
theater, Brianne.


295
00:31:47.461 --> 00:31:48.980
Hey Amanda, let's
get the numbers.


296
00:31:50.464 --> 00:31:52.431
Amanda, snap out of it.

297
00:31:58.541 --> 00:32:00.578
1922

298
00:32:01.579 --> 00:32:02.752
Winner!

299
00:32:02.821 --> 00:32:05.514
1897

300
00:32:05.583 --> 00:32:06.998
Winner!

301
00:32:07.067 --> 00:32:11.140
Two more!

302
00:32:11.209 --> 00:32:13.625
1431

303
00:32:13.694 --> 00:32:16.594
Oh, me, me, me, us, us!

304
00:32:16.663 --> 00:32:21.633
Winner!

305
00:32:21.702 --> 00:32:23.946
A little young there for a
tattoo, aren't you kiddo?


306
00:32:24.015 --> 00:32:27.156
1422

307
00:32:27.225 --> 00:32:31.194
Winner!

308
00:32:31.263 --> 00:32:32.817
What's the matter, little girl?

309
00:32:32.886 --> 00:32:34.715
It's not gonna be that bad?

310
00:32:34.784 --> 00:32:37.511
They'll kill you real
fast, we promise.


311
00:32:37.580 --> 00:32:39.651
Why didn't you just let me in?

312
00:32:39.720 --> 00:32:41.964
I had a note from my dad.

313
00:32:42.033 --> 00:32:45.070
Oh, that's right,
a note from your dad.


314
00:32:45.139 --> 00:32:49.834
How could I forget?

315
00:32:49.903 --> 00:32:52.871
Please allow my
daughter, Brianne,


316
00:32:52.940 --> 00:32:56.426
to see the movie Foaming
at the Mouth Two.


317
00:32:56.495 --> 00:32:59.602
If you don't let her,
you'll regret it.


318
00:33:40.574 --> 00:33:41.782
Hey pal, what'd we miss?

319
00:33:41.851 --> 00:33:44.371
Just the standards,
full moons, owls


320
00:33:44.440 --> 00:33:47.512
and a guy with a monstrous
secret.


321
00:33:47.581 --> 00:33:48.651
Awesome.

322
00:35:01.034 --> 00:35:02.863
Hey buddy, you okay?

323
00:35:12.114 --> 00:35:16.118
I think we should go.

324
00:35:18.707 --> 00:35:20.260
Run!

325
00:35:45.803 --> 00:35:48.391
- Shit!
- Seriously?


326
00:35:48.460 --> 00:35:49.738
It's literally locked.

327
00:35:49.807 --> 00:35:51.187
Oh, my God!

328
00:35:51.256 --> 00:35:52.706
We gotta hide!

329
00:36:28.121 --> 00:36:29.778
Stop that!

330
00:36:29.847 --> 00:36:30.779
Stop what?

331
00:36:30.848 --> 00:36:31.745
What you're doing.

332
00:36:31.814 --> 00:36:35.059
Oh, you mean, this?

333
00:36:35.128 --> 00:36:39.788
What time is it?

334
00:36:39.857 --> 00:36:41.720
4:30.

335
00:36:41.790 --> 00:36:43.930
I have to leave pretty soon.

336
00:36:43.999 --> 00:36:46.380
Sun comes up at 6:30.

337
00:36:46.449 --> 00:36:48.555
My wife's plane doesn't
get here til 5:30.


338
00:36:48.624 --> 00:36:51.730
I'm not worried about your wife.

339
00:36:51.800 --> 00:36:54.078
What does she do again?

340
00:36:54.147 --> 00:36:56.874
She works for the Ciph Room.

341
00:36:56.943 --> 00:36:57.944
Sounds boring.

342
00:36:58.013 --> 00:37:00.774
Yeah, it is, she's
always taking trips,


343
00:37:00.843 --> 00:37:03.881
leaving me here to
take care of the kids.


344
00:37:03.950 --> 00:37:05.606
You don't have kids.

345
00:37:05.675 --> 00:37:08.161
It's what I call the dogs.

346
00:37:08.230 --> 00:37:09.990
Divorce her.

347
00:37:10.059 --> 00:37:11.129
I can't.

348
00:37:11.198 --> 00:37:11.923
Can't?

349
00:37:11.992 --> 00:37:14.477
Not yet anyway.

350
00:37:14.546 --> 00:37:16.410
It's too much money involved.

351
00:37:16.479 --> 00:37:18.481
You don't need money
anymore, my dear.


352
00:37:22.347 --> 00:37:23.555
No fucking way!

353
00:37:23.624 --> 00:37:24.763
Quick, get in the closet!

354
00:37:24.833 --> 00:37:25.833
Oh, come on!

355
00:37:25.868 --> 00:37:26.904
Do it!

356
00:37:50.686 --> 00:37:52.999
Everything alright?

357
00:37:53.068 --> 00:37:55.208
Yeah, you're home early.

358
00:37:55.277 --> 00:37:58.970
Yeah, I took an earlier flight,
thought I'd surprise you.


359
00:37:59.039 --> 00:38:00.316
Well, you did.

360
00:38:00.385 --> 00:38:04.838
Good.

361
00:38:04.907 --> 00:38:06.805
What time did you go to bed?

362
00:38:06.875 --> 00:38:08.773
Oh, about 12:30.

363
00:38:08.842 --> 00:38:09.670
Really?

364
00:38:09.739 --> 00:38:11.155
It's pretty early.

365
00:38:25.376 --> 00:38:26.791
Who's in the closet?

366
00:38:26.860 --> 00:38:28.862
What?

367
00:38:28.931 --> 00:38:33.798
Do you think I'm stupid, Ronald?

368
00:38:33.867 --> 00:38:35.213
Calm down sweetie, okay?

369
00:38:35.282 --> 00:38:37.008
I will.

370
00:38:37.077 --> 00:38:39.010
Just let me check
one more thing first.


371
00:38:39.873 --> 00:38:43.635
Jesus Christ!

372
00:38:43.704 --> 00:38:47.225
Hah, how about that?

373
00:38:47.294 --> 00:38:49.883
You're crazy.

374
00:38:49.952 --> 00:38:52.886
Well, I have two bullets left.

375
00:38:52.955 --> 00:38:56.372
I can use one on you
and one on myself.


376
00:38:56.441 --> 00:38:59.893
No, I'll just use both on you.

377
00:38:59.962 --> 00:39:00.962
No wait!

378
00:39:10.904 --> 00:39:13.010
God, you're heavy.

379
00:39:18.532 --> 00:39:21.018
I gotta hand it to you, Ronald.

380
00:39:21.087 --> 00:39:24.435
You had me fooled
for at least a month.


381
00:39:24.504 --> 00:39:26.885
How long did you think
it would take me?


382
00:39:26.955 --> 00:39:30.475
Out every night, nowhere
to be seen during the day.


383
00:39:30.544 --> 00:39:32.719
I called your work last week.

384
00:39:32.788 --> 00:39:34.928
They said you just
stopped showing up.


385
00:39:34.997 --> 00:39:37.241
Schmuck.

386
00:39:37.310 --> 00:39:40.071
I guess this means you
won't have to divorce me.


387
00:39:40.140 --> 00:39:42.142
No pre-nup, either.

388
00:39:42.211 --> 00:39:46.664
Well, now that you're
dead, I can be honest.


389
00:39:46.733 --> 00:39:49.287
I never took that
trip to Atlanta.


390
00:39:49.356 --> 00:39:52.118
I just waited for you and
that whore in the back


391
00:39:52.187 --> 00:39:54.465
to make it to our bed.

392
00:39:54.534 --> 00:39:57.157
Well, my bed actually.

393
00:39:57.226 --> 00:39:59.780
I'm the one who paid for it.

394
00:39:59.849 --> 00:40:02.093
Where'd you find
the bimbo, anyway?


395
00:40:02.162 --> 00:40:07.271
I followed her around, but
couldn't find where she lived.


396
00:40:07.340 --> 00:40:09.756
Probably homeless.

397
00:40:09.825 --> 00:40:12.690
Way to aim high, Ron.

398
00:40:12.759 --> 00:40:16.487
I spent the last 10
years defending you.


399
00:40:16.556 --> 00:40:18.937
Do you even know
what I went through?


400
00:40:19.007 --> 00:40:22.010
My father kept telling
me, don't marry that man,


401
00:40:22.079 --> 00:40:23.528
he'll only hurt you.

402
00:40:23.597 --> 00:40:24.736
But did I listen?

403
00:40:24.805 --> 00:40:26.221
No.

404
00:40:26.290 --> 00:40:33.297
I just kept telling everyone,
you don't know the real Ron.


405
00:40:33.366 --> 00:40:39.303
Oh, it's just so disgusting.

406
00:40:39.372 --> 00:40:41.132
I hate you, Ronald.

407
00:40:41.201 --> 00:40:43.169
I hate everything about you.

408
00:40:43.238 --> 00:40:48.553
I'm glad that you're dead.

409
00:41:07.227 --> 00:41:09.333
Time to dump the garbage.

410
00:41:25.211 --> 00:41:27.834
Remember this spot, Ron?

411
00:41:27.903 --> 00:41:32.563
We used to stay up all night
and watch the sun come up.


412
00:41:32.632 --> 00:41:33.702
Hmm.

413
00:41:42.883 --> 00:41:44.368
Wow, S&M, charming.

414
00:41:52.790 --> 00:41:59.037
What the hell?

415
00:42:26.444 --> 00:42:29.137
Huh, that's what I thought.

416
00:42:41.287 --> 00:42:46.430
Oh, shit.

417
00:42:46.499 --> 00:42:52.056
Ronald!

418
00:42:52.125 --> 00:42:57.303
Ronald, where are you, honey?

419
00:43:12.076 --> 00:43:15.528
What the fuck is this?

420
00:43:15.597 --> 00:43:19.463
Elaine!

421
00:43:19.532 --> 00:43:22.120
I'm sorry about what I said.

422
00:43:23.191 --> 00:43:25.262
I don't hate you!

423
00:43:25.331 --> 00:43:30.198
I'm just uh, disappointed.

424
00:43:30.267 --> 00:43:32.648
Yeah, that's it, I'm just...

425
00:43:32.717 --> 00:43:35.272
Disappointed and hurt?

426
00:43:35.341 --> 00:43:36.549
Elaine.

427
00:43:36.618 --> 00:43:37.895
Sweety.

428
00:43:37.964 --> 00:43:40.173
Alright, alright,
you wanna divorce?


429
00:43:40.242 --> 00:43:42.555
I'll give you a divorce.

430
00:43:44.695 --> 00:43:49.458
Ron, dear?

431
00:43:49.527 --> 00:43:51.219
Shit.

432
00:44:21.663 --> 00:44:25.356
Hah, spare!

433
00:44:36.436 --> 00:44:38.852
I'll miss
watching the sun come up.


434
00:44:38.921 --> 00:44:42.442
You'll get used to it.

435
00:44:42.511 --> 00:44:44.893
Did you finish, Elaine?

436
00:44:44.962 --> 00:44:50.278
Actually, I had a better idea.

437
00:44:57.871 --> 00:45:01.565
She'll turn just before sunrise.

438
00:45:01.634 --> 00:45:04.050
Figured she'd like
to see it again.


439
00:45:04.119 --> 00:45:06.294
Just for old time's sake.

440
00:45:06.363 --> 00:45:12.610
Payback for putting
four bullet holes in me.


441
00:45:12.679 --> 00:45:15.268
Goodbye, dear.

442
00:45:15.337 --> 00:45:18.582
You know, it never really
was about the money.


443
00:45:18.651 --> 00:45:22.275
It was about spending
the rest of my life


444
00:45:22.344 --> 00:45:28.108
with someone as lifeless as you.

445
00:45:28.177 --> 00:45:35.944
Hurry up, we
have less than 30 minutes!


446
00:45:47.300 --> 00:45:49.302
You were great back there.

447
00:45:49.371 --> 00:45:50.683
Thanks, sweety.

448
00:45:50.752 --> 00:45:51.787
So were you.

449
00:46:19.988 --> 00:46:23.440
Ma'am, you okay?

450
00:46:28.755 --> 00:46:30.447
Cutting it pretty close.

451
00:46:30.516 --> 00:46:31.827
Drive faster.

452
00:46:31.896 --> 00:46:38.109
This is as fast as this
piece of shit goes, sweety.


453
00:46:40.249 --> 00:46:41.492
What the hell are you doing?

454
00:46:41.561 --> 00:46:42.562
I don't know.

455
00:46:42.631 --> 00:46:44.461
It must have got a
flat or something.


456
00:46:44.530 --> 00:46:46.394
Shit, keep driving.

457
00:46:46.463 --> 00:46:50.294
If I keep driving, it's
gonna make things worse.


458
00:46:59.924 --> 00:47:02.340
There's a spare in the back.

459
00:47:23.292 --> 00:47:25.605
What's taking so long?

460
00:47:25.674 --> 00:47:28.159
I thought I saw something.

461
00:47:35.132 --> 00:47:40.448
Open the door!

462
00:47:40.517 --> 00:47:42.139
- Shit!
- What?


463
00:47:42.208 --> 00:47:44.175
It's in Elaine's purse
at the bottom of the river!


464
00:47:44.244 --> 00:47:45.107
What about the house keys?

465
00:47:45.176 --> 00:47:48.283
Well, she had them.

466
00:47:52.908 --> 00:47:53.978
Shit!

467
00:48:01.365 --> 00:48:02.565
Don't you know the combination?

468
00:48:02.608 --> 00:48:03.540
It's not working!

469
00:48:03.609 --> 00:48:06.370
It's been changed!

470
00:48:14.827 --> 00:48:17.243
Elaine, open the door!

471
00:48:29.704 --> 00:48:33.742
Who's lifeless now, schmuck?

472
00:48:51.449 --> 00:48:54.660
So we just
stay in here all night?


473
00:48:54.729 --> 00:48:57.145
I don't know, I just,
I need some time to think.


474
00:48:57.214 --> 00:48:59.457
Okay.

475
00:49:16.544 --> 00:49:18.344
So do you do this for
all of your first dates,


476
00:49:18.407 --> 00:49:21.963
or am I special?

477
00:49:22.032 --> 00:49:23.689
What take them to horror movies?

478
00:49:23.758 --> 00:49:27.969
No, save them from werewolves
and J-horror cliches.


479
00:49:33.699 --> 00:49:36.391
What?

480
00:49:36.460 --> 00:49:39.290
You like me.

481
00:49:39.359 --> 00:49:40.395
Do not.

482
00:49:52.303 --> 00:49:56.376
It's okay, I'm pretty cool.

483
00:49:56.445 --> 00:50:01.381
Yeah, you're okay, when
you're not being a diva.


484
00:50:01.450 --> 00:50:05.213
Excuse me?

485
00:50:05.282 --> 00:50:10.459
You know what, all my
attention's on you now.


486
00:50:10.528 --> 00:50:14.187
So don't screw this up,
lover boy, pressure's on.


487
00:50:20.159 --> 00:50:22.195
Did you hear that?

488
00:50:22.264 --> 00:50:23.714
Yeah, hang on.

489
00:50:48.221 --> 00:50:50.983
Jesus Christ, it's
Michael Martin.


490
00:50:51.052 --> 00:50:53.123
Michael Martin was in
Slumber Party Slaying.


491
00:50:53.192 --> 00:50:56.609
The killer in Camp
Blood is Norman Ferris.


492
00:50:56.678 --> 00:50:58.576
I think I love you.

493
00:50:58.646 --> 00:51:03.547
I know.

494
00:51:06.619 --> 00:51:07.724
Finch, Finch!

495
00:51:20.184 --> 00:51:25.776
Norman Ferris, no defense.

496
00:51:25.845 --> 00:51:29.677
Finch!

497
00:51:38.513 --> 00:51:39.652
Is that supposed to work?

498
00:51:39.721 --> 00:51:41.689
Man, I don't know, he
drowned in the movie!


499
00:51:41.758 --> 00:51:42.655
God, you're such a geek!

500
00:51:42.724 --> 00:51:44.588
No, I'm not!

501
00:52:16.862 --> 00:52:20.728
So Jack,

502
00:52:20.797 --> 00:52:25.008
you said your parents left
just before I got here?


503
00:52:25.077 --> 00:52:26.595
They do that a lot, huh?

504
00:52:26.664 --> 00:52:30.807
Just leave you here alone in
this big old house by yourself?


505
00:52:30.876 --> 00:52:35.846
I'm not alone.

506
00:52:35.915 --> 00:52:38.642
You're just like all
the other sitters.


507
00:52:38.711 --> 00:52:40.678
No one ever believes me.

508
00:52:40.748 --> 00:52:42.715
Hey, hey, take it easy.

509
00:52:42.784 --> 00:52:47.893
I believe you, it's just
a little unusual, is all.


510
00:52:47.962 --> 00:52:49.618
It's cool.

511
00:52:49.687 --> 00:52:52.863
It's just I don't normally
take jobs by text message.


512
00:52:52.932 --> 00:52:55.038
I like to talk to
the parents first.


513
00:52:55.107 --> 00:52:58.144
That way I know
what rules to break.


514
00:53:06.774 --> 00:53:08.706
I don't know about you,

515
00:53:08.776 --> 00:53:10.674
but I like to eat and
watch TV at the same time.


516
00:53:10.743 --> 00:53:12.780
But, but we're not supposed to.

517
00:53:12.849 --> 00:53:14.057
Mom always says that when...

518
00:53:14.126 --> 00:53:15.541
Well, she isn't here, is she?

519
00:53:15.610 --> 00:53:17.715
So it'll be our little secret.

520
00:53:17.785 --> 00:53:19.683
Plus there's a pirates
versus ninjas movie on.


521
00:53:19.752 --> 00:53:20.822
Yay!

522
00:53:26.863 --> 00:53:29.313
You see this,
you pirate bitches?


523
00:53:29.382 --> 00:53:31.729
Uh, somebody save me!

524
00:53:31.799 --> 00:53:33.662
Don't you see it will never end?

525
00:53:33.731 --> 00:53:36.217
Pirate killing ninja,
ninja killing pirate.


526
00:53:36.286 --> 00:53:38.115
It'll never stop.

527
00:53:38.184 --> 00:53:41.394
No, no it won't.

528
00:53:41.463 --> 00:53:44.984
Not unless I kill
every last one of them.


529
00:53:45.053 --> 00:53:46.675
He's just a peasant.

530
00:53:46.744 --> 00:53:48.144
The poor sheath
can hide this steel.


531
00:53:49.575 --> 00:53:50.369
I've got your back, pirate.

532
00:53:50.438 --> 00:53:51.715
What was that?

533
00:53:51.784 --> 00:53:52.612
There's too many of them!

534
00:53:52.681 --> 00:53:53.303
You and Julia get out of here!

535
00:53:53.372 --> 00:53:54.787
Jack!

536
00:53:54.856 --> 00:53:56.893
Hey, Jack!

537
00:53:56.962 --> 00:53:58.284
You guys have a cat
or dog or something,


538
00:53:58.308 --> 00:53:59.792
you forgot to tell me about?

539
00:53:59.861 --> 00:54:03.761
Ninjas and pirates,
it's a new generation.


540
00:54:05.142 --> 00:54:07.904
Then what was that?

541
00:54:07.973 --> 00:54:09.975
I don't know.

542
00:54:10.044 --> 00:54:12.563
Probably the monsters.

543
00:54:12.632 --> 00:54:14.842
The monsters?

544
00:54:14.911 --> 00:54:18.017
The monsters in my room.

545
00:54:18.086 --> 00:54:22.780
You have monsters in your room?

546
00:54:22.850 --> 00:54:26.750
Yeah, I'm sure
that's it, monsters.


547
00:54:51.913 --> 00:54:56.159
Just one more story, please?

548
00:54:56.228 --> 00:54:58.506
Jack, you've had
just one more story


549
00:54:58.575 --> 00:55:00.680
about seven or
eight times already.


550
00:55:00.749 --> 00:55:02.199
It's time for bed, little buddy.

551
00:55:02.268 --> 00:55:06.790
Aw, my other sitters
always read me more stories.


552
00:55:06.859 --> 00:55:08.067
Hey speaking of,

553
00:55:08.136 --> 00:55:10.483
how many other
sitters have you had?


554
00:55:10.552 --> 00:55:13.003
You make it sound like no
one sticks around very long.


555
00:55:17.559 --> 00:55:20.838
Come on, Sarah,
just one more story.


556
00:55:20.908 --> 00:55:25.602
This one's my favorite.

557
00:55:25.671 --> 00:55:28.156
Look, you don't want
to go to bed, I get that.


558
00:55:28.225 --> 00:55:29.917
Is it the dark you're scared of?

559
00:55:29.986 --> 00:55:31.332
I can leave the light on.

560
00:55:31.401 --> 00:55:34.335
No, no, don't let
the light in, okay, promise?


561
00:55:34.404 --> 00:55:37.648
Okay, okay, take it easy.

562
00:55:37.717 --> 00:55:38.995
But think of it this way,

563
00:55:39.064 --> 00:55:40.928
if the light's on, the monsters

564
00:55:40.997 --> 00:55:43.931
are too scared to
come out, alright?


565
00:55:46.002 --> 00:55:48.556
They always come out, always.

566
00:55:57.289 --> 00:55:58.531
Oh.

567
00:56:15.169 --> 00:56:17.033
That little monkey.

568
00:56:17.102 --> 00:56:18.137
Jack!

569
00:56:25.282 --> 00:56:26.387
Jack!

570
00:56:26.456 --> 00:56:29.597
Don't make me come up...

571
00:56:29.666 --> 00:56:30.978
There.

572
00:56:33.394 --> 00:56:35.913
That's weird.

573
00:57:00.386 --> 00:57:02.595
Jack, I thought I told you to...

574
00:57:02.664 --> 00:57:05.840
It wasn't me, it
was the monsters.


575
00:57:05.909 --> 00:57:08.118
And what monsters would that be?

576
00:57:08.187 --> 00:57:11.052
But they, they were...

577
00:57:11.121 --> 00:57:13.089
Jack, there are so
such thing as monsters,


578
00:57:13.158 --> 00:57:16.609
and there will be no
more playing, got it?


579
00:57:16.678 --> 00:57:18.335
It's bed time, buddy.

580
00:57:18.404 --> 00:57:22.615
Now sweet dreams.

581
00:57:22.684 --> 00:57:25.480
No one ever believes me.

582
00:57:53.370 --> 00:57:56.201
That is it, mister!

583
00:57:56.270 --> 00:58:00.550
You are going to be in so
much...


584
00:58:09.076 --> 00:58:10.422
They're real!

585
00:58:10.491 --> 00:58:11.526
The monsters!

586
00:58:11.595 --> 00:58:13.010
I told you.

587
00:58:13.080 --> 00:58:14.667
Jack, I gotta get
you out of here!


588
00:58:14.736 --> 00:58:16.773
Oh, they're not going to get me.

589
00:58:16.842 --> 00:58:19.707
They're trying to
get away from me.


590
00:58:19.776 --> 00:58:21.916
I like them, they're mine.

591
00:58:21.985 --> 00:58:24.401
I won't ever let them leave.

592
00:58:24.470 --> 00:58:26.610
Jack!

593
00:58:26.679 --> 00:58:29.993
It's not them, it's me.

594
00:58:30.062 --> 00:58:31.995
I'm the monster.

595
00:58:32.064 --> 00:58:37.104
The monster you're so scared of.

596
00:58:37.173 --> 00:58:39.209
No!

597
00:58:39.278 --> 00:58:41.177
It can't be!

598
00:59:35.679 --> 00:59:37.094
It's like Dawn of the Dead here.

599
00:59:37.164 --> 00:59:40.236
Kinda yeah, with like
tweaking out zombies.


600
00:59:40.305 --> 00:59:44.378
No, like real 1978
lumbering Romero zombies.


601
00:59:51.178 --> 00:59:54.146
Well, I guess it's time
for the chicken exit.


602
00:59:54.215 --> 00:59:58.323
Do you think we
could push through?


603
00:59:58.392 --> 01:00:02.706
We're gonna have to
before they come fully to.


604
01:00:02.775 --> 01:00:03.775
You're kidding.

605
01:00:07.608 --> 01:00:08.988
That's our only way out.

606
01:00:09.057 --> 01:00:14.787
Okay.

607
01:02:10.455 --> 01:02:12.008
Well, I'm not really sure

608
01:02:12.077 --> 01:02:14.113
how I'm gonna top this
for a second date.


609
01:02:14.182 --> 01:02:15.977
Second date?

610
01:02:16.046 --> 01:02:18.186
Well yeah, I mean,

611
01:02:18.255 --> 01:02:21.983
I kinda wanna take you
out again, if you want to.


612
01:02:22.052 --> 01:02:24.641
I had fun!

613
01:02:24.710 --> 01:02:27.575
And I guess you could say
I saved your ass in there,


614
01:02:27.644 --> 01:02:29.163
so I feel like you owe me.

615
01:02:29.232 --> 01:02:31.579
I owe you?

616
01:02:31.648 --> 01:02:37.413
Okay, one condition, no movies.

617
01:02:37.482 --> 01:02:39.760
Do you hear something?
