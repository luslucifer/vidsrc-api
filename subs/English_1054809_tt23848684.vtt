[male announcer]<i>New York City,</i>

[audience cheering]

7
00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:39.330
-Thank you. Thank you very much.
-[music fading]


8
00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:42.010
Relax. Thank you.
That was aggressive.


9
00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:43.530
-Uh…
-[audience laughing]


10
00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:45.330
I was already terrified

11
00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:46.850
-before I came out.
-[audience laughing]


12
00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:49.850
I am doing stand-up comedy in 2022.

13
00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.130
-Anything could happen tonight.
-[audience laughing]


14
00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:55.010
I could be arrested, assaulted,
stabbed, slapped.


15
00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:59.130
-Even worse, discussed on Reddit.
-[audience laughing, applauding]


16
00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:02.370
I don't know how your evening goes.
Maybe you get home,


17
00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:04.770
digitally alter photographs
of yourself to prove


18
00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:07.610
that you had a real-life experience
on a platform designed


19
00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:10.890
to give you depression and anxiety
by trading your data for dopamine,


20
00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:14.450
in a world in which your news is fake
but your comic books are real,


21
00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:16.970
and the only thing we can really
be certain about tonight


22
00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:21.410
is some billionaire CEO with, like,
baller money and virgin energy


23
00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:25.090
will put his little rocket inside
a supermodel or space, or both.


24
00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:28.410
-Welcome to the show, guys.
-[audience cheering, applauding]


25
00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.690
Tonight, New York City,
I'd love to take you home.


26
00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:37.210
-Do you wanna go home with me, yeah?
-[audience cheering]


27
00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:38.370
[Vir] Lovely!

28
00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:40.810
Your home! I might not be allowed
back into mine.


29
00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:42.330
-Um…
-[audience laughing]


30
00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:44.850
I just wanna see who
I am working with this evening.


31
00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:48.690
You guys look like a good bunch.
I see, uh, I see Indian people.


32
00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:50.170
[audience laughing]

33
00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:52.730
I see people who are sleeping
with Indian people.


34
00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:56.050
[audience laughing, cheering]

35
00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:00.850
I see random White people who thought
Vir Das was German.


36
00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:03.050
-I see you guys as well.
-[audience laughing, cheering]


37
00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:04.370
Didn't look at the poster.

38
00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:09.410
Home is whatever feels safe
because we live in an unsafe world.


39
00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:10.850
-Can we agree on that?
-[audience] Yes!


40
00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:13.850
I just got back from London, England.
Unsafe!


41
00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:14.890
[audience laughing]

42
00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:19.010
Central London, in my hotel, a block away,
the middle of the afternoon,


43
00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:21.610
an 82-year-old couple,
out for an afternoon walk,


44
00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:23.490
murder in broad daylight.

45
00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:24.930
Yeah!

46
00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:28.410
-The guy they killed was so young. Right?
-[audience laughing]


47
00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:32.730
The old guy stabbed him
while the old lady tried to rob him.


48
00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:35.250
Because old British ladies don't normally,
like, kill people.


49
00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:37.410
They let other people do it
and give them knighthoods.


50
00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:40.370
-Um…
-[audience laughing, applauding]


51
00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:44.130
They do the robbing, right?

52
00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:46.050
It's… it's not stolen wealth.

53
00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:48.570
-It's "Commonwealth," right?
-[audience laughing]


54
00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:50.890
-Is this too soon? [laughs]
-[audience laughing]


55
00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:52.450
I am sorry! I don't care.

56
00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:55.250
The only queen I like
has "Yas" before her title.


57
00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:58.650
-[audience laughing, cheering]
-I like Yas Queens.


58
00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:00.530
Do you think anyone said that?

59
00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:02.290
They all gather around.
She's like, "William…"


60
00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:03.530
-[audience laughing]
-[chuckles]


61
00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:05.970
-"You must unite the family."
-[audience laughing]


62
00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:08.130
-"Make up with your brother."
-[audience laughing]


63
00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:10.970
-And he's like, "Yas, Queen!"
-[audience laughing, applauding]


64
00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:12.610
[Vir] I don't know, man.

65
00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:14.290
When you come to New York,

66
00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:17.810
every saying about your city
is partially true.


67
00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:19.210
[audience laughing]

68
00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:21.050
And they're like,
"You don't fuck with New York!"


69
00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:23.810
"Nobody can shut down New York!"
Very powerful!


70
00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:28.450
-And then it rains for three minutes.
-[audience laughing, applauding]


71
00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:32.690
-And you guys give up on life.
-[audience laughing]


72
00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:35.810
And not even real rain.
This weak-ass North American rain.


73
00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:37.130
-Right, this…
-[audience laughing]


74
00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:40.250
…this purposeless mist
that just hangs around your face


75
00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:41.890
like multiple alcoholics

76
00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:45.010
-having an animated conversation.
-[audience laughing]


77
00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:49.170
Listen, I come from Mumbai.
There is monsoon in Mumbai, right?


78
00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:51.610
-[audience cheering]
-It is--


79
00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:54.650
-That's God's orgasm right there.
-[audience laughing]


80
00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:56.330
And in Mumbai, they come on your face

81
00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:58.690
-for three months a year.
-[audience laughing, applauding]


82
00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:01.410
Mumbai rain is so strong,
it causes loss of hearing.


83
00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:02.570
Did you know that?

84
00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:05.290
-You ever seen Indian people do this shit?
-[audience laughing]


85
00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:07.770
-It's trauma, you racist!
-[audience laughing]


86
00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:10.810
People told me New York City
was unsafe. I disagree.


87
00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:13.570
-I've driven through the rest of America.
-[audience laughing]


88
00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:16.090
You drive through
these lovely woods and forests.


89
00:04:16.210 --> 00:04:18.930
Basically, the setting of every
true crime documentary


90
00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:20.730
-you have ever watched in your life.
-[audience laughing]


91
00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:22.650
America is just miles and miles

92
00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:24.890
-where you can bury bodies.
-[audience laughing]


93
00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:28.130
-Interrupted by cities that supply them.
-[audience laughing]


94
00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:31.370
Mumbai, one of the safest cities
in the world. Do you know why?


95
00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:33.090
No place to bury a body in Mumbai.

96
00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:34.930
-That's why.
-[audience laughing]


97
00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:38.050
You can bury a body
ten feet underground in Mumbai.


98
00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:39.370
The next morning, there will be laundry

99
00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:41.050
-hanging from that body.
-[audience laughing]


100
00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:43.610
That body will be an extra
in a Bollywood movie.


101
00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:46.290
Because in Mumbai,

102
00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:49.290
-death is no excuse for unemployment.
-[audience laughing]


103
00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:52.610
What I like though,
is you have a nice sense of community


104
00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:53.770
in small towns.

105
00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:56.930
Right? Like a college kid
goes missing into the forest.


106
00:04:57.290 --> 00:05:00.210
In five minutes, all the people
in town come together,


107
00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:02.810
hold hands and go
into the forest to look for that kid.


108
00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:06.650
-In five minutes, "Angela!"
-[audience laughing]


109
00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:09.450
"This way. Angela!" [laughs]

110
00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:13.170
Yo! You could not pay me enough money

111
00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:16.010
-to go into a forest with White people.
-[audience laughing]


112
00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:19.410
-That's how cults get started.
-[audience laughing]


113
00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:22.330
Ten White people
and a vulnerable Brown man in wildlife.


114
00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:23.490
I will be declared your leader.

115
00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:24.770
-I promise you.
-[audience laughing]


116
00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:26.410
Like… like if you came to me
and you're like,


117
00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:29.530
"Vir, there's a college kid missing
in the forest."


118
00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:31.650
Do you know what I would do immediately?

119
00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:34.250
I would call my cousins
back home in India.


120
00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:37.050
'Cause now there's a vacancy
in that college.


121
00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:40.050
[audience laughing, applauding]

122
00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:41.570
Guys…

123
00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:45.610
One man's death is another man's degree.

124
00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:47.650
-This is all I am saying.
-[audience laughing]


125
00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:49.810
Says something about your society though

126
00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:53.490
that an act of violence
is an anomaly worth documenting


127
00:05:54.010 --> 00:05:55.530
-instead of the norm.
-[audience laughing]


128
00:05:55.690 --> 00:05:58.010
You know, White people are in danger,
people get proactive.


129
00:05:58.090 --> 00:06:00.170
-They send cameras into a forest.
-[audience laughing]


130
00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:02.930
Black people and Brown people
are in danger,


131
00:06:03.010 --> 00:06:04.250
we just hold up our cell phones

132
00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:06.050
-and film that shit.
-[audience laughing]


133
00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:08.490
All Black and Brown true crime
documentaries are shaky,


134
00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:10.290
-handheld footage at best.
-[audience laughing]


135
00:06:10.690 --> 00:06:12.210
Because there is no sense
of mystery, right?


136
00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:15.090
In White true crime,
the killer's never found.


137
00:06:15.530 --> 00:06:19.010
In Black or Brown true crime,
the killer's on camera, in uniform.


138
00:06:19.450 --> 00:06:23.770
-[audience] Oh! [cheering, applauding]
-Guys! Guys!


139
00:06:26.850 --> 00:06:29.130
I'm just here to eat some beef
and then I leave tomorrow, all right?


140
00:06:29.250 --> 00:06:30.490
-Relax.
-[audience laughing]


141
00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:33.730
I think the only country
that has it together is Russia.


142
00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:36.090
-[audience laughing]
-They're just like,


143
00:06:36.170 --> 00:06:38.930
-"Life is short. We party."
-[audience laughing]


144
00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:43.890
The most badass Russian I met this year,
I went to the KGB museum in Prague.


145
00:06:44.010 --> 00:06:46.730
If you haven't been, you must go.
It's not a museum.


146
00:06:46.810 --> 00:06:48.450
It's a ten-foot by ten-foot basement

147
00:06:48.530 --> 00:06:51.010
-with a racist Russian man inside.
-[audience laughing]


148
00:06:51.170 --> 00:06:52.930
Opening of the door, very powerful.

149
00:06:53.090 --> 00:06:55.650
He comes out from behind a curtain.
He's like, "Hello!"


150
00:06:56.050 --> 00:06:59.090
-[audience laughing]
-"Welcome to museum of KGB."


151
00:06:59.330 --> 00:07:02.170
-[audience laughing]
-Like the name was a secret.


152
00:07:02.810 --> 00:07:04.370
I was in, immediately.

153
00:07:04.690 --> 00:07:07.410
-I was like, "You had me at 'K'."
-[audience laughing]


154
00:07:07.810 --> 00:07:10.450
I was converted. For two weeks,
I followed my wife around the house,


155
00:07:10.570 --> 00:07:12.890
-naked, just going, "KGB."
-[audience laughing]


156
00:07:14.530 --> 00:07:17.290
-As some of you will do later tonight.
-[audience laughing]


157
00:07:17.610 --> 00:07:19.890
-Your wife, not mine. [inhales]
-[audience laughing]


158
00:07:20.010 --> 00:07:21.890
The high point of this store
is the propaganda.


159
00:07:21.970 --> 00:07:24.650
He's like, "All right.
Everybody, come close. I tell you secret."


160
00:07:25.290 --> 00:07:28.650
"In World War Two,
Hitler have 3,000 tons of Nazi Gold."


161
00:07:29.010 --> 00:07:32.650
"At the end of the war,
they only find 150 tons of Nazi Gold."


162
00:07:33.130 --> 00:07:36.890
"Nobody know where rest of gold go.
But many years later, America is most


163
00:07:37.010 --> 00:07:39.170
-powerful country in the world."
-[audience laughing]


164
00:07:39.570 --> 00:07:41.530
And I was like,
"I underpaid for this talk."


165
00:07:41.690 --> 00:07:43.290
[audience laughing]

166
00:07:44.050 --> 00:07:46.490
It was a beautiful ironic moment, right?

167
00:07:46.650 --> 00:07:51.330
To stand there as an Indian and pretend
to disapprove of undeclared gold.


168
00:07:51.610 --> 00:07:54.970
[audience laughing, applauding]

169
00:07:55.850 --> 00:07:56.810
Oh…

170
00:07:57.650 --> 00:08:00.610
You think Nazi Gold is a conspiracy?
You haven't heard of Auntie Gold,


171
00:08:00.690 --> 00:08:02.170
-have you?
-[audience laughing]


172
00:08:02.530 --> 00:08:05.890
Every single Indian woman here tonight
has a bank locker


173
00:08:05.970 --> 00:08:08.370
-her husband knows nothing about…
-[audience laughing]


174
00:08:08.730 --> 00:08:10.130
…with gold that Indiana Jones

175
00:08:10.250 --> 00:08:11.730
-couldn't fucking find.
-[audience laughing]


176
00:08:11.810 --> 00:08:13.010
You will find Christ's chalice

177
00:08:13.130 --> 00:08:14.770
before you find Manju's necklace,
all right?


178
00:08:14.890 --> 00:08:16.570
[audience laughing, cheering]

179
00:08:17.330 --> 00:08:20.010
But home is where you feel safe.
Can we agree?


180
00:08:20.170 --> 00:08:22.810
-[audience cheering]
-This is something I think about.


181
00:08:22.890 --> 00:08:25.410
On an Air India flight
from Newark to Mumbai


182
00:08:25.530 --> 00:08:29.090
on the 27th of November 2021,
I am going home.


183
00:08:29.290 --> 00:08:32.010
A younger Air India air hostess
who is about 65…


184
00:08:32.250 --> 00:08:33.650
-[audience laughing]
-…comes up to me


185
00:08:33.730 --> 00:08:36.410
and offers me a glass of gin.
I refuse the gin. She says,


186
00:08:36.490 --> 00:08:39.050
-"Mr. Das, just drink the damn gin!"
-[audience laughing]


187
00:08:39.410 --> 00:08:42.650
The reason she insists, we both feel
that when I land in Mumbai,


188
00:08:42.730 --> 00:08:45.090
I am going to be arrested
and taken to prison.


189
00:08:45.290 --> 00:08:47.930
Now, I had prepared in my own way
to go to prison.


190
00:08:48.330 --> 00:08:50.730
I have stopped shaving,
begun doing push-ups.


191
00:08:50.850 --> 00:08:52.090
[audience laughing]

192
00:08:52.610 --> 00:08:54.250
The reason that I am in trouble.

193
00:08:54.610 --> 00:08:58.290
I have recently done a video
about my country at the Kennedy Center


194
00:08:58.370 --> 00:09:02.250
-called the "Two Indias" video. [inhales]
-[audience cheering, applauding]


195
00:09:15.930 --> 00:09:18.490
-You say that now!
-[audience laughing]


196
00:09:18.890 --> 00:09:22.010
The video is about the duality
in my nation and the need for us


197
00:09:22.090 --> 00:09:23.370
to unite in the light.

198
00:09:23.450 --> 00:09:26.050
It has caused
a lot of duality in my nation.


199
00:09:26.170 --> 00:09:28.610
-[audience laughing]
-And many people have united


200
00:09:28.690 --> 00:09:31.410
-in being pissed off at me.
-[audience laughing]


201
00:09:31.650 --> 00:09:33.930
I have been the number one trend
in the country for three weeks,


202
00:09:34.050 --> 00:09:36.490
had seven criminal complaints
filed against me,


203
00:09:36.730 --> 00:09:40.690
being charged with sedition
and defaming India on foreign soil.


204
00:09:40.810 --> 00:09:43.330
I was called a terrorist
on three different news channels


205
00:09:43.410 --> 00:09:44.810
-on the primetime news.
-[audience cheering]


206
00:09:44.970 --> 00:09:48.850
That is an interesting conversation
with your mother that evening.


207
00:09:48.970 --> 00:09:51.810
-[audience laughing]
-Just watching the news like,


208
00:09:51.890 --> 00:09:54.850
"Remember how you said how you don't know
how to describe what I do for a living?"


209
00:09:54.930 --> 00:09:57.770
[audience laughing, applauding]

210
00:10:02.050 --> 00:10:04.530
The headlines had,
"Vir Das is a terrorist."


211
00:10:04.650 --> 00:10:06.210
And I just remember thinking,

212
00:10:06.290 --> 00:10:09.210
"This is so insulting
to actual terrorists."


213
00:10:09.330 --> 00:10:11.530
[audience laughing]

214
00:10:12.250 --> 00:10:13.530
Can you imagine how terrorists feel?

215
00:10:13.610 --> 00:10:16.330
-They're like, "Bro, this guy?"
-[audience laughing]


216
00:10:16.730 --> 00:10:19.850
"We choreograph acts of violence
ten years in advance,


217
00:10:20.210 --> 00:10:21.690
but now we have to do spoken word

218
00:10:21.810 --> 00:10:23.450
-performance apparently."
-[audience laughing]


219
00:10:23.930 --> 00:10:26.570
New York, I never got any feedback
from any terrorist groups.


220
00:10:26.690 --> 00:10:27.970
-I promise you.
-[audience laughing]


221
00:10:28.490 --> 00:10:31.090
I never got a phone call,
"Hey, Vir, ISIS, huge fans."


222
00:10:31.210 --> 00:10:33.770
-"Love your work."
-[audience laughing, applauding]


223
00:10:34.810 --> 00:10:36.610
"Vir, where are you doing
your next comedy special?"


224
00:10:36.770 --> 00:10:38.770
-[audience laughing]
-"No, we know you tried Netflix,


225
00:10:38.850 --> 00:10:41.650
-but we'd like you to try ISIS."
-[audience laughing]


226
00:10:41.890 --> 00:10:44.850
"Vir, I don't know if you know this
but ISIS has way more subscribers


227
00:10:44.930 --> 00:10:47.010
-than Netflix."
-[audience laughing, applauding]


228
00:10:47.290 --> 00:10:48.970
Which is true. They do.

229
00:10:50.610 --> 00:10:53.610
-Much better family-sharing plan.
-[audience laughing]


230
00:10:54.130 --> 00:10:56.770
And really, ISIS and Netflix
just want the same thing,


231
00:10:56.850 --> 00:10:59.530
-which is for you to blow up.
-[audience laughing]


232
00:11:00.690 --> 00:11:02.010
I was on the news here too.

233
00:11:02.130 --> 00:11:05.770
I was on CNN and I was like,
"When did they start doing the news?"


234
00:11:05.850 --> 00:11:07.770
-[audience laughing]
-I…


235
00:11:07.890 --> 00:11:11.890
-[audience applauding]
-…was on the BBC. Home page!


236
00:11:12.050 --> 00:11:15.610
Big headline that said,
"Comedian polarizes the nation."


237
00:11:15.810 --> 00:11:17.330
-[audience laughing]
-Do you know how badly


238
00:11:17.410 --> 00:11:20.650
you have to fuck up before the British say
that you divided India?


239
00:11:20.810 --> 00:11:23.650
[audience laughing, cheering]

240
00:11:31.410 --> 00:11:34.570
Certain parties back home began lobbying
for my citizenship to be revoked


241
00:11:34.690 --> 00:11:37.090
on the grounds
that I am not a pure Indian.


242
00:11:37.370 --> 00:11:39.770
I have been polluted by Western thought.

243
00:11:39.930 --> 00:11:42.250
Be very careful of people
who celebrate purity.


244
00:11:42.330 --> 00:11:43.690
And that's not even history.

245
00:11:43.770 --> 00:11:47.370
-That's just basic <i>Harry Potter.</i>
-[audience laughing, applauding]


246
00:11:47.570 --> 00:11:50.650
They start a hashtag,
they're like, "Vir Das is a slave!"


247
00:11:51.010 --> 00:11:52.330
"Western slave!"

248
00:11:52.450 --> 00:11:56.130
Which would be offensive to me
except my last name is Das.


249
00:11:56.290 --> 00:11:57.890
[audience laughing]

250
00:11:58.730 --> 00:12:01.010
I'll translate. Don't worry, non-Indians.
Don't worry. I got you.


251
00:12:01.090 --> 00:12:03.490
Like, so Das literally means "slave,"

252
00:12:04.050 --> 00:12:05.610
but my first name is Vir,

253
00:12:05.690 --> 00:12:08.530
-so apparently, I am a brave slave.
-[audience laughing]


254
00:12:08.650 --> 00:12:11.130
Which-
- Isn't that all slaves, really?

255
00:12:11.210 --> 00:12:13.490
-[audience laughing]
-Have you ever met a nonchalant slave?


256
00:12:14.050 --> 00:12:16.930
"Yeah, I'm a slave.
It's pretty chilled out. Yeah, you know…"


257
00:12:17.050 --> 00:12:19.690
"Mostly work from home.
Their home. Hashtag, blessed."


258
00:12:19.810 --> 00:12:21.850
[audience laughing, applauding]

259
00:12:22.010 --> 00:12:25.810
While it offends me, they are not wrong.
I was raised abroad.


260
00:12:26.090 --> 00:12:28.450
Partially, so I have always felt
kind of stuck, right?


261
00:12:28.690 --> 00:12:32.610
I am too Indian for the West
but too Western for India.


262
00:12:32.770 --> 00:12:35.410
-Does that make sense to anybody?
-[audience cheering]


263
00:12:35.610 --> 00:12:37.770
That's easy applause.
I'll break it down, all right?


264
00:12:37.970 --> 00:12:38.970
Like, okay, check it out.

265
00:12:39.130 --> 00:12:42.170
I am not so Indian
that I would study to be a doctor.


266
00:12:42.290 --> 00:12:43.690
-Mm-mm.
-[audience laughing]


267
00:12:43.810 --> 00:12:48.610
No! But, like, I am Indian enough
where I would never use a White doctor.


268
00:12:49.050 --> 00:12:51.130
[audience laughing, applauding]

269
00:12:51.770 --> 00:12:52.770
Sorry.

270
00:12:53.930 --> 00:12:54.930
It's just…

271
00:12:55.890 --> 00:12:58.650
I would let an Indian engineer treat me
before a White doctor.


272
00:12:59.410 --> 00:13:00.690
I don't need curative medicine.

273
00:13:00.770 --> 00:13:03.530
-I need cheap efficient solutions now!
-[audience laughing]


274
00:13:03.890 --> 00:13:05.610
I don't need probiotics for gut health.

275
00:13:05.690 --> 00:13:07.330
I need a belt that burps me
every five minutes.


276
00:13:07.410 --> 00:13:09.010
-Yo, fucker, let's go.
-[audience laughing]


277
00:13:09.250 --> 00:13:12.770
All right, okay.
I have my eye on Western policy,


278
00:13:12.850 --> 00:13:16.050
so I believe that the abortion ruling
in America is a travesty.


279
00:13:16.410 --> 00:13:18.730
-Anything under 29--
-[audience laughing]


280
00:13:19.370 --> 00:13:21.730
-[shushes] Shut up. [chuckles]
-[audience laughing]


281
00:13:22.010 --> 00:13:23.250
Anything under 29 weeks,

282
00:13:23.330 --> 00:13:26.130
I believe is a woman's body
and her choice alone.


283
00:13:26.210 --> 00:13:28.010
-I believe that, all right?
-[audience applauding]


284
00:13:28.130 --> 00:13:30.650
-But I am also Indian!
-[audience laughing]


285
00:13:31.370 --> 00:13:34.090
So, I believe that anything
over seven years,


286
00:13:34.410 --> 00:13:36.490
a parent should be
able to take a slipper

287
00:13:36.570 --> 00:13:40.210
-and murder their child.
-[audience laughing, cheering]


288
00:13:41.650 --> 00:13:44.210
-I believe in long-game abortion.
-[audience laughing]


289
00:13:45.050 --> 00:13:46.730
And I look forward to your vote.
[chuckles]


290
00:13:46.810 --> 00:13:49.610
-[audience laughing]
-And long-game discipline.


291
00:13:49.810 --> 00:13:53.290
When I was 17, my best friend and I
crashed his father's car.


292
00:13:53.610 --> 00:13:55.690
His father kicked his own son
in the balls.


293
00:13:55.770 --> 00:13:58.610
-[audience laughing]
-He disciplined two generations


294
00:13:58.690 --> 00:14:01.010
-that evening, guys.
-[audience laughing]


295
00:14:02.090 --> 00:14:04.410
My best friend has a son now.
His son's first words were,


296
00:14:04.490 --> 00:14:06.610
-"I am sorry, Papa."
-[audience laughing]


297
00:14:08.050 --> 00:14:11.690
Like, I perform in America,
so I worry about being shot in America.


298
00:14:11.770 --> 00:14:13.370
I think you need gun control

299
00:14:13.450 --> 00:14:15.210
-legislation immediately.
-[audience applauding]


300
00:14:15.330 --> 00:14:17.610
-But I am also Indian.
-[audience laughing]


301
00:14:18.050 --> 00:14:21.370
So, I wanna be friends with at least
that one guy who has a gun.


302
00:14:21.450 --> 00:14:23.810
[audience laughing, applauding]

303
00:14:26.490 --> 00:14:28.770
-In case, shit goes down. [chuckles]
-[audience laughing]


304
00:14:28.890 --> 00:14:30.050
I can call Punjab and be like,

305
00:14:30.170 --> 00:14:32.410
-"Manjeet, I need you."
-[audience laughing]


306
00:14:32.530 --> 00:14:35.810
And I am not insinuating
that all Punjabi people have guns. Relax.


307
00:14:35.890 --> 00:14:38.170
Some of them have blades and swords.
Much quicker.


308
00:14:38.250 --> 00:14:40.290
-[audience laughing]
-Human beings are just fruit


309
00:14:40.410 --> 00:14:42.330
-with feelings.
-[audience laughing]


310
00:14:43.170 --> 00:14:46.690
Like I learned English first,
so my English is stronger than my Hindi,


311
00:14:46.770 --> 00:14:50.410
but I believe that Hindi
is a stronger language than English.


312
00:14:50.530 --> 00:14:52.370
There are beautiful words in Hindi

313
00:14:52.490 --> 00:14:55.770
that English doesn't have the power
to express as a language.


314
00:14:55.850 --> 00:14:57.610
-[audience laughing]
-Beautiful words like--


315
00:14:57.730 --> 00:15:00.370
-[clicks tongue]
-[audience laughing, applauding]


316
00:15:01.290 --> 00:15:02.370
That's a Hindi word.

317
00:15:03.890 --> 00:15:06.330
Non-Indians,
have you heard us do that shit, yeah?


318
00:15:06.530 --> 00:15:08.250
-[audience laughing]
-It means about 40 different things.


319
00:15:08.810 --> 00:15:10.170
Come on, everybody do it with me.
Come on.


320
00:15:10.250 --> 00:15:12.490
-I am happy. [clicks tongue]
-[audience clicking tongues, laughing]


321
00:15:12.810 --> 00:15:14.730
-I am sad. [clicks tongue]
-[audience clicking tongues, laughing]


322
00:15:14.930 --> 00:15:16.850
-Fuck you! [clicks tongue]
-[audience clicking tongues, laughing]


323
00:15:16.970 --> 00:15:20.730
-Fuck me! [clicks tongue]
-[audience laughing]


324
00:15:21.050 --> 00:15:22.370
White people can't make that noise.

325
00:15:22.450 --> 00:15:25.090
You need years of humidity
and cynicism to happen.


326
00:15:25.170 --> 00:15:26.090
[audience laughing]

327
00:15:26.170 --> 00:15:29.370
Give White people, like, ten more years
of climate change and Donald Trump,


328
00:15:29.450 --> 00:15:31.490
they'll all be walking around like…
[clicks tongue] "Goddammit!"


329
00:15:31.610 --> 00:15:32.970
[audience laughing]

330
00:15:33.450 --> 00:15:36.170
But, like, I am not so confident
in English


331
00:15:36.250 --> 00:15:39.050
-that I would have sex in English.
-[audience laughing]


332
00:15:39.490 --> 00:15:41.570
-I have sex in Hindi.
-[audience laughing]


333
00:15:42.810 --> 00:15:44.770
Because English sex is very confident,
right?


334
00:15:44.850 --> 00:15:47.650
-It's like, "Yeah, girl!"
-[audience laughing]


335
00:15:48.010 --> 00:15:49.610
"I'm about to clap those cheeks, girl!"

336
00:15:49.730 --> 00:15:51.250
-"Shit!"
-[audience laughing]


337
00:15:52.210 --> 00:15:54.730
-"We about to smash AF, girl!"
-[audience laughing]


338
00:15:54.850 --> 00:15:56.810
I don't have sex like that.
When I have sex, I'm like…


339
00:15:56.890 --> 00:15:59.530
[in Hindi] "Thank you so much.
May God always bless you."


340
00:15:59.690 --> 00:16:01.410
[audience laughing, cheering]

341
00:16:03.090 --> 00:16:04.930
"May you never forget me."

342
00:16:06.890 --> 00:16:08.450
[in English] Non-Indians,
that is the only joke


343
00:16:08.530 --> 00:16:10.290
I will not translate for you this evening.

344
00:16:10.370 --> 00:16:12.770
-[audience laughing]
-Purely for my self-esteem.


345
00:16:14.370 --> 00:16:16.690
A campaign has circulated
among school children


346
00:16:16.770 --> 00:16:18.530
who are making my video viral.

347
00:16:18.690 --> 00:16:20.610
The campaign says,
"If you ever get a chance


348
00:16:20.690 --> 00:16:25.690
to speak to a crowd abroad,
be a Swami Vivekananda, not a Vir Das."


349
00:16:25.930 --> 00:16:28.970
-With a picture of both of us together.
-[audience laughing]


350
00:16:29.370 --> 00:16:30.850
This is a lot of pressure, 
New York City.

351
00:16:30.930 --> 00:16:32.290
-Can we agree?
-[audience cheering]


352
00:16:32.410 --> 00:16:35.170
-To compare comedians to spiritual gurus.
-[audience laughing]


353
00:16:35.370 --> 00:16:38.290
-Nobody does the reverse.
-[audience laughing]


354
00:16:39.370 --> 00:16:42.690
I have never read a review
in the newspaper entertainment section,


355
00:16:42.850 --> 00:16:45.370
"Dalai Lama, not as funny
as we thought he was gonna be."


356
00:16:45.490 --> 00:16:48.570
-[audience laughing]
-"Jesus Christ, better magician


357
00:16:48.650 --> 00:16:50.530
-than comedian."
-[audience laughing]


358
00:16:50.730 --> 00:16:53.330
"Moses keeps repeating
the same ten jokes."


359
00:16:53.450 --> 00:16:55.850
-"Get new material, Moses!"
-[audience laughing, applauding]


360
00:16:55.970 --> 00:16:58.610
"Mohammed, loved the book,
hated the cartoon."


361
00:16:58.730 --> 00:17:01.130
[audience laughing, groaning]

362
00:17:01.530 --> 00:17:02.890
Yeah, let's talk about death threats.

363
00:17:03.010 --> 00:17:04.890
-Uh-- [laughs]
-[audience laughing, cheering]


364
00:17:05.050 --> 00:17:06.090
We get so many.

365
00:17:06.210 --> 00:17:08.170
My family is instructed
to turn their phones off


366
00:17:08.250 --> 00:17:10.730
because we get tens of thousands
of death threats.


367
00:17:10.930 --> 00:17:13.650
And I don't say that to manufacture
sympathy or bravado.


368
00:17:13.730 --> 00:17:17.610
I am nobody's victim, nobody's hero.
All right? Indians are very passé


369
00:17:17.690 --> 00:17:20.090
-about death threats anyway.
-[audience laughing]


370
00:17:20.210 --> 00:17:23.090
Like, you threaten an American's family,
they feel triggered.


371
00:17:23.210 --> 00:17:24.690
[audience laughing]

372
00:17:25.490 --> 00:17:28.130
Indians, you can literally look at us
and, guys, I'll translate now.


373
00:17:28.210 --> 00:17:29.610
You can look at an Indian
and be like…


374
00:17:29.690 --> 00:17:32.650
-[in Hindi] "I will…
-[audience laughing]


375
00:17:32.770 --> 00:17:35.770
-…kill your father and drink his blood."
-[audience laughing]


376
00:17:35.890 --> 00:17:39.570
[in English] Translation, "I will kill
your father and drink his blood."


377
00:17:39.690 --> 00:17:40.890
[audience laughing]

378
00:17:41.050 --> 00:17:45.090
You can say that to an Indian person
out loud and we'll be like, "Okay!"


379
00:17:45.250 --> 00:17:47.610
[audience laughing, applauding]

380
00:17:49.170 --> 00:17:50.170
Try.

381
00:17:52.130 --> 00:17:53.130
But not on Tuesday, huh?

382
00:17:53.210 --> 00:17:55.770
-It's non-veg, technically, so…
-[audience laughing]


383
00:17:56.170 --> 00:18:01.810
I also get 1.8 million social media
followers across platforms in 72 hours


384
00:18:01.930 --> 00:18:04.770
-between the age of 18 and 25.
-[audience cheering]


385
00:18:05.010 --> 00:18:10.170
I'm sitting on the youngest,
largest, most progressive


386
00:18:10.770 --> 00:18:12.770
dumb fuckest audience
I have ever had in my life!


387
00:18:12.890 --> 00:18:14.050
[audience laughing]

388
00:18:14.290 --> 00:18:16.610
Are you here tonight?
Eighteen to 25, make some noise.


389
00:18:16.810 --> 00:18:18.690
[audience cheering, applauding]

390
00:18:19.170 --> 00:18:21.730
-You dumb bastards, why?
-[audience laughing]


391
00:18:21.930 --> 00:18:24.290
-Don't get me wrong. I love your money…
-[audience laughing]


392
00:18:24.370 --> 00:18:27.250
…but you make me feel like
the creepy uncle at the disco, you know?


393
00:18:27.330 --> 00:18:29.330
-[audience laughing]
-They don't even know.


394
00:18:29.410 --> 00:18:31.250
They're like, "What's a disco, bro?
Is it a back problem?"


395
00:18:31.370 --> 00:18:33.090
-It's not a back problem!
-[audience laughing]


396
00:18:33.250 --> 00:18:35.090
It's a room where your parents
dry humped each other.


397
00:18:35.250 --> 00:18:36.890
-[audience laughing]
-They all join in.


398
00:18:36.970 --> 00:18:38.010
They're like, "We're with you, Vir."

399
00:18:38.090 --> 00:18:40.050
"This is a movement."
And I'm like, "No, it's not!"


400
00:18:40.210 --> 00:18:42.650
Your other hand is eating noodles
that your mom made.


401
00:18:42.730 --> 00:18:44.610
-This is not a movement.
-[audience laughing]


402
00:18:44.810 --> 00:18:46.730
We're just trying to plug
into virtue together


403
00:18:46.850 --> 00:18:49.290
by behaving like animals on social media.

404
00:18:49.810 --> 00:18:51.130
Because it's turning us into that.

405
00:18:51.490 --> 00:18:54.410
You ever seen a lion roar?
[imitates lion roaring]


406
00:18:54.490 --> 00:18:57.250
Instantly, what happens?
The rest of the pack is like…

[imitates lion roaring]

408
00:18:58.650 --> 00:19:00.610
-That's a retweet!
-[audience laughing]


409
00:19:02.290 --> 00:19:04.570
-You've ever seen wildebeest charging?
-[audience laughing]


410
00:19:04.650 --> 00:19:06.170
They don't know what the fuck
they're charging at,


411
00:19:06.250 --> 00:19:07.890
who they're following,
they're still charging.


412
00:19:07.970 --> 00:19:10.090
-That's a hashtag.
-[audience laughing]


413
00:19:10.730 --> 00:19:13.010
You ever seen two birds talk
to each other? [imitates bird noise]


414
00:19:13.090 --> 00:19:15.410
One takes off… [imitates bird noise]
…another one lands.


415
00:19:15.610 --> 00:19:18.090
Same sound, different movements.
That's a TikTok.


416
00:19:18.250 --> 00:19:21.490
-[audience laughing]
-Maybe to them it sounds cooler, right?


417
00:19:21.610 --> 00:19:23.330
Like you and me, we hear--
[imitates bird noise]


418
00:19:23.610 --> 00:19:26.450
-[audience laughing]
-Maybe in bird language, it sounds like…

<i>-♪ You will remember ♪</i>


422
00:19:36.010 --> 00:19:37.370
I love that song.

423
00:19:37.490 --> 00:19:40.450
Every time it plays
in my mind an influencer dies.

[audience laughing]

425
00:19:43.370 --> 00:19:46.450
Here's why I think your generation
might save the world.


426
00:19:46.810 --> 00:19:49.890
-You have zero emotional retention.
-[audience laughing, cheering]


427
00:19:50.050 --> 00:19:54.610
You must articulate every experience,
mid-experience and receive validation


428
00:19:54.690 --> 00:19:57.290
for the experience
before you have completed the experience.


429
00:19:57.370 --> 00:19:59.810
[audience laughing, applauding]

430
00:20:02.690 --> 00:20:05.610
But what that means
is you are not emotionally repressed.


431
00:20:05.770 --> 00:20:07.490
You don't carry, you know,
baggage around.


432
00:20:07.570 --> 00:20:10.090
You just express yourself.
You feel something new in your body,


433
00:20:10.170 --> 00:20:12.490
you're like,
"I think I identify as a woman."


434
00:20:12.730 --> 00:20:14.730
You're not repressed.
You get on the internet.


435
00:20:14.810 --> 00:20:16.930
You're like,
"I think I identify as a woman."

-[exhales sharply]

That's how old I am. That's the sound
I think the internet makes.


438
00:20:22.290 --> 00:20:24.050
[audience laughing]

439
00:20:24.170 --> 00:20:27.570
Somebody across the world is like,
"Hey, man, I identify as a woman too."


440
00:20:27.650 --> 00:20:29.570
"Here's what you need to do.
Step one, two, three."


441
00:20:29.650 --> 00:20:30.770
-[exhales sharply]
-[audience laughing]


442
00:20:30.850 --> 00:20:34.970
That's a privilege and a skill.
Don't ever take that for granted.


443
00:20:35.490 --> 00:20:37.770
We had nobody
for these conversations, right?


444
00:20:38.050 --> 00:20:40.970
-All we had were Indian parents.
-[audience laughing]


445
00:20:41.610 --> 00:20:45.010
If I walked into my parent's room like,
"Good morning, Mommy, Daddy."


446
00:20:45.210 --> 00:20:47.170
-[audience laughing]
-"I think…"


447
00:20:47.490 --> 00:20:48.850
[audience laughing]

448
00:20:51.250 --> 00:20:52.690
[audience applauding]

449
00:20:54.130 --> 00:20:56.890
-"…I identify as a woman."
-[audience laughing]


450
00:20:57.970 --> 00:20:59.970
-"Okay!"
-[audience laughing]


451
00:21:00.250 --> 00:21:02.570
"Could you identify as a woman
who does well on her exams?"


452
00:21:02.650 --> 00:21:04.690
-"How about that shit, huh?"
-[audience laughing, applauding]


453
00:21:05.090 --> 00:21:06.730
"She would be very welcome in this house."

454
00:21:07.890 --> 00:21:09.970
"A woman who gets into Harvard,
we care about admission,


455
00:21:10.050 --> 00:21:11.450
-not transition."
-[audience laughing]


456
00:21:11.530 --> 00:21:13.370
And I don't care
about your transition either.


457
00:21:13.490 --> 00:21:16.890
It is the prerogative of every generation
to shatter your social constructs


458
00:21:17.090 --> 00:21:18.170
through conversation.

459
00:21:18.250 --> 00:21:21.210
For you, that's gender.
So, go ahead, shatter it.


460
00:21:21.370 --> 00:21:22.850
We might wind up someplace cool.

461
00:21:22.970 --> 00:21:27.650
I hope you enjoy this fluidity as much
as your parents enjoyed infidelity.


462
00:21:28.010 --> 00:21:29.570
[audience laughing]

463
00:21:30.330 --> 00:21:33.210
-Oh, now we're uncomfortable, huh?
-[audience laughing]


464
00:21:33.530 --> 00:21:36.010
You don't need to have a gender,
but Mom and Dad still need


465
00:21:36.090 --> 00:21:38.330
-to have principles apparently, huh?
-[audience laughing]


466
00:21:38.610 --> 00:21:42.290
Your parents were shackled by marriage,
so they created a divorce industry.


467
00:21:42.530 --> 00:21:44.890
Your grandparents were shackled by race.

468
00:21:45.010 --> 00:21:46.610
That's what they broke down.
Those barriers.


469
00:21:46.690 --> 00:21:47.890
We don't have to talk about it.

470
00:21:48.210 --> 00:21:51.690
We can pretend like your grandmother goes
to Jamaica every summer for the seafood.


471
00:21:51.850 --> 00:21:53.010
[audience laughing]

472
00:21:53.970 --> 00:21:55.810
-Guys, grow up!
-[audience laughing]


473
00:21:56.050 --> 00:21:58.690
Your grandparents
were 20 years old in the 60s.


474
00:21:58.810 --> 00:22:01.570
Your grandmom and grandad
have been to one orgy minimum.


475
00:22:01.770 --> 00:22:03.970
-[audience laughing]
-They didn't call it that.


476
00:22:04.050 --> 00:22:06.210
They called it, like, tambola night
or some shit like that, all right?


477
00:22:06.410 --> 00:22:08.130
The communist party
or some shit like that.


478
00:22:08.250 --> 00:22:09.370
[audience laughing, applauding]

479
00:22:09.970 --> 00:22:11.970
For my generation, it was sexuality.

480
00:22:12.530 --> 00:22:14.690
Our parents couldn't have
that conversation with us.


481
00:22:14.810 --> 00:22:19.250
When I was 13, my mom came to me
like a detective who had solved a mystery.


482
00:22:19.450 --> 00:22:20.930
-[audience laughing]
-She's like, "Vir,


483
00:22:21.130 --> 00:22:24.250
-you don't have a girlfriend."
-[audience laughing]


484
00:22:24.730 --> 00:22:27.370
-"Women will not talk to you."
-[audience laughing]


485
00:22:27.530 --> 00:22:30.970
"If you're gay, tell me now.
We'll take you to a doctor and fix you."


486
00:22:31.090 --> 00:22:32.210
[audience laughing]

487
00:22:32.330 --> 00:22:34.690
I was like, "Mom, I'm not a gay.
I'm just a loser."


488
00:22:34.850 --> 00:22:36.730
[audience laughing, applauding]

489
00:22:36.890 --> 00:22:38.730
Those two are the opposite
of each other, right?


490
00:22:38.970 --> 00:22:41.050
'Cause gay men are winners.
They are always levelling up.


491
00:22:41.130 --> 00:22:44.130
My friend, Shashank. Here's how we dress,
here's how he dresses.


492
00:22:44.330 --> 00:22:45.450
Here's what we eat, here's what--

493
00:22:45.530 --> 00:22:47.810
-He dreams better than us.
-[audience laughing]


494
00:22:48.050 --> 00:22:50.730
He sleeps with a smile on his face
every night. Just-- Hmm!


495
00:22:50.890 --> 00:22:52.490
[audience laughing]

496
00:22:52.850 --> 00:22:55.690
He wakes up, I am like, "Shashank,
what the fuck are you dreaming about?"


497
00:22:55.770 --> 00:22:57.970
-He's like, "Sorbet."
-[audience laughing]


498
00:22:58.930 --> 00:22:59.930
"Sorbet?"

499
00:23:01.010 --> 00:23:03.850
"Even your dreams are lactose-free
and upper-middle-class, man."


500
00:23:04.050 --> 00:23:05.530
[audience laughing, applauding]

501
00:23:05.930 --> 00:23:06.930
I…

502
00:23:08.090 --> 00:23:09.930
I have never dreamt of sorbet.

503
00:23:10.290 --> 00:23:12.850
I have dreamt of one Toblerone
chocolate my entire life.


504
00:23:12.930 --> 00:23:13.890
[audience laughing]

505
00:23:13.970 --> 00:23:16.290
And in my dream, I didn't get to eat
the fucking chocolate.


506
00:23:16.490 --> 00:23:18.770
-[audience laughing ]
-It's still wound up inside me.


507
00:23:19.090 --> 00:23:21.650
-[audience] Oh! [laughing, cheering]
-But, you know…


508
00:23:24.410 --> 00:23:26.850
-That joke gets that reaction every time.
-[audience laughing]


509
00:23:27.010 --> 00:23:29.970
I'm not sure why though. I don't know
if it's because the joke is a twist


510
00:23:30.210 --> 00:23:32.330
or because of the texture
of the Toblerone.


511
00:23:32.570 --> 00:23:34.090
[audience laughing]

512
00:23:34.210 --> 00:23:35.770
'Cause, you know it would
take a while, right?


513
00:23:35.850 --> 00:23:38.690
'Cause you're putting a triangle
inside a circle. You know what I mean?


514
00:23:38.810 --> 00:23:40.770
-These are my dreams.
-[audience laughing]


515
00:23:41.010 --> 00:23:42.930
And this is how I
want to use my platform.

516
00:23:43.090 --> 00:23:46.010
-[laughs]
-[audience laughing, applauding]


517
00:23:47.450 --> 00:23:48.450
But, um…

518
00:23:49.770 --> 00:23:52.290
You know, I was curious
about my sexuality as well.


519
00:23:52.410 --> 00:23:55.250
So, when I was 13, I made out with a boy.
I tried it.


520
00:23:55.770 --> 00:23:57.490
-You know, and in…
-[audience cheering]


521
00:23:57.610 --> 00:23:59.370
-[clears throat]
-[audience laughing]


522
00:24:00.090 --> 00:24:02.490
And in five minutes,
we knew it wasn't for us.


523
00:24:02.570 --> 00:24:05.170
It didn't feel wrong,
but it didn't feel right for us.


524
00:24:05.250 --> 00:24:06.370
-Make sense?
-[audience] Yes!


525
00:24:06.650 --> 00:24:09.170
Never talk about it.
Most people in my generation don't


526
00:24:09.290 --> 00:24:12.370
because we studied Science
in Delhi Public School!


527
00:24:12.570 --> 00:24:14.170
[audience cheering, applauding]

528
00:24:14.650 --> 00:24:18.370
So, we were always taught that,
"All experiments must be success."


529
00:24:18.730 --> 00:24:20.250
[audience laughing, applauding]

530
00:24:20.530 --> 00:24:22.210
So, from my perspective,
I am not straight.


531
00:24:22.290 --> 00:24:25.370
-I failed the homosexuality entrance exam.
-[audience laughing]


532
00:24:25.450 --> 00:24:28.890
-I ace my SATs, fail my GAYs.
-[audience laughing]


533
00:24:29.530 --> 00:24:31.930
But my first kiss was a straight boy.

534
00:24:32.490 --> 00:24:36.850
-Yeah. So, ladies, I empathize.
-[audience laughing]


535
00:24:37.450 --> 00:24:38.490
[gags]

536
00:24:39.170 --> 00:24:40.770
We sign up for different things, right?

537
00:24:40.850 --> 00:24:44.170
You sign up for kissing.
We sign up for exploring, you know?


538
00:24:44.330 --> 00:24:45.330
[audience laughing]

539
00:24:45.450 --> 00:24:49.850
It's like the inside of my mouth
was the Earth and he believed it was flat.


540
00:24:50.010 --> 00:24:51.250
[audience laughing]

541
00:24:51.450 --> 00:24:53.570
I was like, "Hey, man,
do you wanna go round a little bit?"


542
00:24:53.890 --> 00:24:56.810
He's like, "No, I will keep going in
the same direction till I find the end."


543
00:24:56.970 --> 00:24:57.970
[audience laughing]

544
00:24:58.530 --> 00:25:01.330
Look how uncomfortable the room
is right now by the way.


545
00:25:02.370 --> 00:25:05.970
I am sorry, America.
Am I punching down on straight men?


546
00:25:06.130 --> 00:25:08.170
[audience laughing]

547
00:25:09.410 --> 00:25:12.290
These are the rules of comedy
that you have set in the West, right?


548
00:25:12.730 --> 00:25:16.290
Always make fun of people
who have more privilege than you do.


549
00:25:16.410 --> 00:25:17.850
That is called a punch up.

550
00:25:18.050 --> 00:25:20.930
Never make fun of people
who have less privilege than you.


551
00:25:21.050 --> 00:25:22.330
That is called a punch down!

552
00:25:22.450 --> 00:25:23.890
-Have you heard of this, yeah?
-[audience laughing]


553
00:25:23.970 --> 00:25:25.730
What a bullshit Western construct

554
00:25:25.810 --> 00:25:26.930
-this is!
-[audience laughing]


555
00:25:27.010 --> 00:25:29.410
Because in the West,
your privilege is consistent.


556
00:25:29.690 --> 00:25:31.610
Indian privilege is very volatile.

557
00:25:31.970 --> 00:25:34.610
Up and down, like a feather.
Fluttering on the wind.


558
00:25:34.770 --> 00:25:37.610
<i>One moment you are Forrest Gump,</i>
<i>next moment you are Laal Singh Chaddha.</i>


559
00:25:37.690 --> 00:25:40.490
-[audience laughing, applauding]
-Up and down, up and down, up and down!


560
00:25:46.010 --> 00:25:48.690
Plus, honestly, I feel like in the West,
most of you are calling out


561
00:25:48.770 --> 00:25:51.610
your own privilege before
other people call out your privilege


562
00:25:51.850 --> 00:25:53.330
so that you can go back to quietly

563
00:25:53.410 --> 00:25:55.410
-enjoying your privilege.
-[audience laughing]


564
00:25:55.690 --> 00:25:58.370
Some of you look confused.
The White people are like, "He knows!"


565
00:25:58.690 --> 00:26:00.290
[audience laughing]

566
00:26:00.730 --> 00:26:03.770
The minute you add nuance
to the privilege conversation,


567
00:26:03.890 --> 00:26:06.250
it falls apart. 
Like, okay, you tell me.

568
00:26:07.210 --> 00:26:11.530
Could I, a Brown man from India,
could I make fun of Ivanka Trump?


569
00:26:11.650 --> 00:26:13.530
-Is that a punch up? Yeah?
-[audience cheering]


570
00:26:13.810 --> 00:26:15.810
Allowed? Let's add layers.

571
00:26:16.330 --> 00:26:20.450
What if Ivanka Trump has a baby
with a Syrian Muslim refugee?


572
00:26:20.890 --> 00:26:22.810
-[crowd groaning, gasping]
-It could happen. Love is love.


573
00:26:23.050 --> 00:26:24.050
[audience laughing]

574
00:26:25.130 --> 00:26:27.930
-Could I make fun of the baby?
-[indistinct chatter]


575
00:26:28.170 --> 00:26:30.570
-You weak bastards!
-[audience laughing]


576
00:26:31.970 --> 00:26:34.970
Guys, come on. Muslim refugee
Trump baby is hilarious, guys.


577
00:26:35.130 --> 00:26:37.090
-[audience laughing]
-Guys, just…


578
00:26:38.290 --> 00:26:40.770
-Think about this baby.
-[audience laughing, cheering]


579
00:26:41.010 --> 00:26:43.010
Inzamam-ul-Trump.
Think about him, all right?


580
00:26:43.090 --> 00:26:45.610
[audience laughing, applauding]

581
00:26:46.730 --> 00:26:48.130
I don't know why
he is two feet tall.

582
00:26:48.210 --> 00:26:50.930
All right. It's none of my business.
Think about this fucking baby.


583
00:26:51.050 --> 00:26:55.330
He owns 75 buildings in Manhattan
but has no homeland. Come on!


584
00:26:55.410 --> 00:26:56.490
[audience laughing]

585
00:26:56.570 --> 00:26:58.970
I know, I know.
Uncomfortable, uncomfortable.


586
00:26:59.450 --> 00:27:01.570
-[audience laughing]
-[laughs] I'll pull back. Um…


587
00:27:02.170 --> 00:27:04.610
Vladimir Putin. Could I make fun
of Vladimir Putin?


588
00:27:04.730 --> 00:27:05.690
-Punch up?
-[audience cheering]


589
00:27:05.770 --> 00:27:09.570
Let's add layers.
What if Vladimir Putin had alopecia?


590
00:27:09.890 --> 00:27:11.210
[audience laughing]

591
00:27:11.490 --> 00:27:12.450
Oh!

592
00:27:13.290 --> 00:27:15.810
You thought Jada
was the only bald dictator?


593
00:27:15.930 --> 00:27:18.130
[audience laughing, applauding]

594
00:27:19.770 --> 00:27:21.570
He's just sad, sitting in the Kremlin,

595
00:27:21.650 --> 00:27:23.010
-rubbing his head.
-[audience laughing]


596
00:27:23.530 --> 00:27:25.650
-Nothing grows in Russia.
-[audience laughing]


597
00:27:26.330 --> 00:27:28.130
Please don't cancel me. I apologize.

598
00:27:28.530 --> 00:27:30.130
Please! I don't wanna get cancelled.

599
00:27:30.250 --> 00:27:32.170
It would really interfere
with my incarceration.


600
00:27:32.410 --> 00:27:34.210
[audience laughing]

601
00:27:35.130 --> 00:27:36.930
This is the big Western comic complaint.

602
00:27:37.130 --> 00:27:38.730
I was with an American comic.

603
00:27:38.810 --> 00:27:40.850
He was like,
"Vir, Cancel Culture is insane!"


604
00:27:41.490 --> 00:27:45.330
"The other day a mob came after me!
A mob! On Twitter!"


605
00:27:45.570 --> 00:27:47.650
[audience laughing, applauding]

606
00:27:50.530 --> 00:27:53.650
-[smacks lips] Okay.
-[audience laughing, applauding]


607
00:28:00.370 --> 00:28:03.810
It's like telling the freshly castrated
that your balls itch.


608
00:28:03.890 --> 00:28:05.770
-[audience laughing]
-The most annoying article


609
00:28:05.850 --> 00:28:07.370
that I ever read in the West is,

610
00:28:07.490 --> 00:28:10.730
"Why doesn't Indian comedy content
push the envelope?"


611
00:28:10.850 --> 00:28:13.810
[laughs sarcastically] Really, bitch?
Because we looked inside the envelope!


612
00:28:13.930 --> 00:28:15.370
[audience laughing]

613
00:28:15.570 --> 00:28:17.610
There are court cases inside the envelope.

614
00:28:18.010 --> 00:28:20.090
There is a court date
on the top of the envelope.


615
00:28:20.170 --> 00:28:21.610
-Um--
-[audience laughing]


616
00:28:21.810 --> 00:28:23.650
So, we make safe content, right?

617
00:28:23.730 --> 00:28:28.170
When we're in India, we make safe movies
where India always defeats Pakistan.


618
00:28:28.450 --> 00:28:30.370
-[audience laughing]
-Doesn't matter at what!


619
00:28:30.450 --> 00:28:33.290
Battle, cricket, inhaling, Uno!
We always win.


620
00:28:33.450 --> 00:28:34.530
[audience laughing]

621
00:28:34.690 --> 00:28:36.930
-And we love these movies, yes?
-[audience cheering]


622
00:28:37.050 --> 00:28:40.010
And then when we're abroad,
we make safe family content.


623
00:28:40.690 --> 00:28:43.770
Aww, look at this sitcom
about this South Asian family.


624
00:28:43.970 --> 00:28:45.770
Look how they get on with their neighbors.

625
00:28:45.850 --> 00:28:47.130
Do you know what they do at night?

626
00:28:47.210 --> 00:28:49.530
They watch Bollywood movies
about shooting their neighbors.


627
00:28:49.650 --> 00:28:50.810
[audience laughing]

628
00:28:51.050 --> 00:28:52.810
Aww, but they are so conservative.

629
00:28:53.290 --> 00:28:55.050
Yeah! They live abroad.

630
00:28:55.170 --> 00:28:57.890
-That's where conservative India lives.
-[audience laughing]


631
00:28:58.210 --> 00:28:59.210
Abroad.

632
00:28:59.530 --> 00:29:03.010
If you want your Indian children
to be virgins at 25,


633
00:29:03.170 --> 00:29:05.130
you raise them in New Jersey,
not New Delhi.


634
00:29:05.250 --> 00:29:07.530
[audience laughing, applauding]

635
00:29:08.930 --> 00:29:10.050
[inaudibly] Sorry!

636
00:29:14.810 --> 00:29:17.210
I know it hurt, but it's true.
Am I wrong?


637
00:29:17.410 --> 00:29:19.210
-[audience] No!
-Any people raised


638
00:29:19.330 --> 00:29:21.370
by Indian parents abroad?
Come on, second generations.


639
00:29:21.450 --> 00:29:23.090
Let me see you. Come on.
Indian parents here.


640
00:29:23.170 --> 00:29:24.770
I say this to you with respect.

641
00:29:25.330 --> 00:29:28.130
Your parent's version of India
does not exist.


642
00:29:28.250 --> 00:29:30.650
-It's archaic, it's gone!
-[audience cheering]


643
00:29:31.010 --> 00:29:32.770
Also, your pop culture portrayal

644
00:29:32.850 --> 00:29:34.810
-of India doesn't exist.
-[audience laughing]


645
00:29:34.930 --> 00:29:36.210
This India where we all walk around like…

646
00:29:36.330 --> 00:29:38.330
-[mumbles]
-[audience laughing]


647
00:29:38.690 --> 00:29:40.210
Do we talk like that back home?

648
00:29:40.370 --> 00:29:41.450
-[audience] No!
-No,


649
00:29:41.530 --> 00:29:43.530
-Indians talk like that here! [chuckles]
-[audience laughing]


650
00:29:43.690 --> 00:29:46.130
You know what that shit is?
That's an American accent.


651
00:29:46.250 --> 00:29:48.970
-[audience laughing]
-Come home!


652
00:29:49.770 --> 00:29:52.450
-[in Hindi] Come on!
-[audience laughing]


653
00:29:52.650 --> 00:29:56.490
[in English] Come home and witness
modern India in all of our chaos


654
00:29:56.570 --> 00:29:58.210
but our infinitely larger beauty.

655
00:29:58.290 --> 00:30:00.410
-Come home.
-[audience cheering]


656
00:30:01.130 --> 00:30:05.410
And if you are not going to come home,
never lecture us from abroad


657
00:30:05.610 --> 00:30:07.370
about what it means to be Indian.

658
00:30:07.450 --> 00:30:10.650
-In the words of every Mumbaikar I know…
-[audience cheering]


659
00:30:10.850 --> 00:30:13.130
[in Hindi] "Come and dare to battle me
or else, fuck off!"


660
00:30:13.250 --> 00:30:15.130
[audience cheering]

661
00:30:26.530 --> 00:30:27.850
[in English] I'll translate. Don't worry.

662
00:30:28.570 --> 00:30:29.690
It's not as good in English.

663
00:30:29.810 --> 00:30:31.250
-I'm just going to be honest.
-[audience laughing]


664
00:30:31.370 --> 00:30:33.210
Because you heard the response
in Hindi, right?


665
00:30:33.330 --> 00:30:36.050
-It was like-- You know?
-[audience laughing]


666
00:30:36.410 --> 00:30:39.250
But in English,
it literally translates into like,


667
00:30:39.410 --> 00:30:40.530
"Get on the field

668
00:30:40.730 --> 00:30:43.410
-or shove something up your ass."
-[audience laughing]


669
00:30:43.490 --> 00:30:44.610
It's not as good.

670
00:30:45.730 --> 00:30:49.810
-It's also a very specific life choice.
-[audience laughing]


671
00:30:51.450 --> 00:30:52.370
I…

672
00:30:53.770 --> 00:30:55.850
I don't know
what kind of situation you are in…


673
00:30:55.970 --> 00:30:57.050
[audience laughing]

674
00:30:57.130 --> 00:30:59.970
-…but the only two choices you have…
-[audience laughing]


675
00:31:02.410 --> 00:31:03.970
I don't even know what kind
of field this is,


676
00:31:04.050 --> 00:31:05.250
-you know?
-[audience laughing]


677
00:31:05.570 --> 00:31:07.050
Is it like a battlefield?

678
00:31:07.570 --> 00:31:09.570
You know, like two guys are like,
"All right, lads?"


679
00:31:09.690 --> 00:31:11.690
-[audience laughing]
-"It's time…


680
00:31:12.650 --> 00:31:16.010
to fight for our country, and our land."

681
00:31:16.570 --> 00:31:18.210
"So, we're gonna get on that field

682
00:31:18.650 --> 00:31:20.810
and if it's a battle
they are looking for, well, fuck it,


683
00:31:20.930 --> 00:31:22.890
-it's a battle they're gonna get."
-[audience laughing]


684
00:31:23.050 --> 00:31:24.170
"Are you with me?"

685
00:31:25.130 --> 00:31:27.130
-"No, I'm all right."
-[audience laughing]


686
00:31:27.530 --> 00:31:29.490
"I'm just gonna shove a wee
something up my ass."


687
00:31:29.650 --> 00:31:31.010
[audience laughing, applauding]

688
00:31:31.170 --> 00:31:32.170
I don't know.

689
00:31:34.330 --> 00:31:37.410
Ooh, Like an-- Like an athletic field,
like two marathon runners,


690
00:31:37.490 --> 00:31:38.850
you know, they're like,
"Okay, we have trained


691
00:31:38.930 --> 00:31:41.210
-for these moments our entire lives."
-[audience laughing]


692
00:31:41.370 --> 00:31:42.690
"We are going to get on this field

693
00:31:43.010 --> 00:31:45.170
and we are going
to win a gold medal for Nigeria."


694
00:31:45.330 --> 00:31:47.410
-[audience laughing]
-"Are you with me?"


695
00:31:47.850 --> 00:31:49.450
[clicks tongue]
"Okay, I am very tired now!"


696
00:31:49.570 --> 00:31:50.810
[audience laughing]

697

[audience laughing]

699
00:31:54.570 --> 00:31:57.730
Or like a-
- Like a farming American field.

700
00:31:57.810 --> 00:32:01.730
Like, you know,
two farmers are like, "Well, Jim…"

[audience laughing]

702
00:32:03.330 --> 00:32:04.650
"…I see a lot of corn."

703
00:32:06.130 --> 00:32:09.370
"Might be time to get on that field
and cut her down."


704
00:32:09.490 --> 00:32:11.170
[audience laughing, cheering]

-[audience laughing]


709
00:32:23.130 --> 00:32:24.490
"Well, we just improvised

710
00:32:24.570 --> 00:32:26.530
-a bit right now."
-[audience laughing]


711
00:32:26.650 --> 00:32:30.850

-It's a transition.
-[audience laughing]


732
00:33:22.010 --> 00:33:25.130
You know, it's your job to tell them lies.
Make them believe in miracles.


733
00:33:25.210 --> 00:33:28.890
Fucking God, Tooth Fairy, tax refunds.
That comes from you.

[audience laughing]

the day you went out into the real world

-and discovered your parents are morons?
-[audience laughing]


737
00:33:38.650 --> 00:33:42.370
-I was six.
-[audience laughs, applauds]


738
00:33:43.490 --> 00:33:46.690
My father and I, we were on the balcony
looking up at the stars,


739
00:33:46.930 --> 00:33:48.970
and I was like,
"Papa, what are the stars?"


740
00:33:49.130 --> 00:33:50.690
My father, without missing a beat,

741
00:33:50.810 --> 00:33:53.010
he's like, "Vir, there is a bright light
up in heaven."


742
00:33:53.410 --> 00:33:55.330
"That light used to blind human beings."

743
00:33:55.490 --> 00:33:59.130
"So, God took a black chart paper
and put it between heaven and Earth."


744
00:33:59.210 --> 00:34:01.010
[audience laughing, applauding]

745
00:34:01.210 --> 00:34:04.650
"Then God took a pencil
and punctured holes in the chart paper."


746
00:34:04.730 --> 00:34:06.210
-[audience laughing]
-"That became heaven's light."


747
00:34:06.290 --> 00:34:09.970
-And I was like, "My daddy is awesome."
-[audience laughing]


748
00:34:10.810 --> 00:34:13.410
And I took that information
and went to real school.


749
00:34:13.530 --> 00:34:15.650
[audience laughing]

750
00:34:15.810 --> 00:34:18.370
And I discovered,
no, my dad is on drugs apparently.


751
00:34:18.450 --> 00:34:20.130
[audience laughing, applauding]

752
00:34:20.250 --> 00:34:23.370
I was all passive-aggressive
with my teacher for no reason.


753
00:34:23.450 --> 00:34:26.970
My teacher's like,
"A star is a burning mass of hydrogen."


754
00:34:27.050 --> 00:34:29.410
I'm like, "This bitch doesn't know
about the chart paper!"


755
00:34:29.490 --> 00:34:32.810
[audience laughing, applauding]

756
00:34:34.370 --> 00:34:35.810
She is like, "Your father's wrong."

757
00:34:35.890 --> 00:34:38.530
I am like, "Get my dad's name
out of your fucking mouth!"


758
00:34:38.610 --> 00:34:41.090
-[imitates slapping sound]
-[audience laughing, applauding]


759
00:34:41.450 --> 00:34:44.610
Relax. Relax, babe.

760
00:34:45.570 --> 00:34:49.210
I would never slap a teacher.
Their salaries do that.


761
00:34:49.290 --> 00:34:52.890
[audience groaning, applauding]

762
00:34:53.210 --> 00:34:56.090
Do you remember
touching another human being's body


763
00:34:56.170 --> 00:34:59.050
but you hadn't seen
so much porn and Instagram


764
00:34:59.130 --> 00:35:00.970
that their body felt like a miracle?

765
00:35:01.410 --> 00:35:03.570
Like the first time
I took a girl's shirt off,


766
00:35:03.650 --> 00:35:07.930
-I was 16 years old and I believed…
-[audience laughing]


767
00:35:08.250 --> 00:35:11.210
…that if I push this breast in,
the other one would become bigger.


768
00:35:11.330 --> 00:35:13.090
[audience laughing, applauding]

769
00:35:14.850 --> 00:35:17.970
[chuckles] Don't judge me.
She felt the same way about my balls.


770
00:35:18.050 --> 00:35:20.050
All right, she was like,
"If I squeeze him,


771
00:35:20.130 --> 00:35:22.690
-he'll go to the neighbor's house."
-[audience laughing]


772
00:35:23.050 --> 00:35:25.130
This is geopolitics.
That's all it is, right?


773
00:35:25.290 --> 00:35:27.090
-[audience laughing]
-Apply pressure to the smaller community.


774
00:35:27.170 --> 00:35:29.010
Grow the larger community
and cause migration.


775
00:35:29.090 --> 00:35:33.330
-That's all it is. Yeah! Yeah!
-[audience laughing, applauding]


776
00:35:34.330 --> 00:35:37.730
We hunt for miracles,
and I submit to you that they still exist.


777
00:35:37.850 --> 00:35:40.290
Hear me out for a second,
New York, New Jersey.


778
00:35:40.410 --> 00:35:42.370
-Um.
-[audience laughing, applauding]


779
00:35:43.290 --> 00:35:44.290
This…

780
00:35:45.250 --> 00:35:48.650
This microphone is a miracle.
Hear me out.


781
00:35:49.370 --> 00:35:52.130
A microphone was invented 144 years ago.

782
00:35:52.810 --> 00:35:54.970
It has changed the world
more than any man alive.


783
00:35:55.650 --> 00:35:57.370
A microphone started World War Two.

784
00:35:58.210 --> 00:36:01.850
A microphone liberated Black people.
A microphone oppressed Jewish people.


785
00:36:02.850 --> 00:36:04.570
There are parts of the world
where this enables


786
00:36:04.650 --> 00:36:06.770
big people to talk about small things.

787
00:36:07.530 --> 00:36:08.610
In my part of the world,

788
00:36:08.690 --> 00:36:11.570
this enables small people to talk
about big things.


789
00:36:12.450 --> 00:36:14.890
The reason I am always in trouble…

790
00:36:16.930 --> 00:36:18.970
[audience laughing]

791
00:36:19.410 --> 00:36:21.530
…is because I discovered
the power of this microphone


792
00:36:21.610 --> 00:36:22.850
when I was eight years old.

793
00:36:22.970 --> 00:36:25.010
Tonight, New York City,
I'd love to tell you that story.


794
00:36:25.090 --> 00:36:29.130
-Would you like to hear that story?
-[audience cheering, applauding]


795
00:36:29.290 --> 00:36:30.610
I went to a fucked up boarding school

796
00:36:30.690 --> 00:36:32.890
-where a lot of strange shit happened.
-[audience laughing]


797
00:36:32.970 --> 00:36:36.490
Violence is an integral part
of the Indian schooling system.


798
00:36:36.570 --> 00:36:39.650
-Indians, have we been beaten?
-[audience] Yes!


799
00:36:39.730 --> 00:36:41.690
-With equipment?
-[audience] Yes!


800
00:36:41.770 --> 00:36:45.050
With cricket bats-- Commonwealth Games
of child abuse. Really.


801
00:36:45.130 --> 00:36:46.170
[audience laughing]

802
00:36:46.250 --> 00:36:49.330
I was once beaten
with a table tennis racquet for two hours.


803
00:36:49.410 --> 00:36:50.330
[audience laughing]

804
00:36:50.410 --> 00:36:52.730
Do you know the level of skill
and precision you need?


805
00:36:52.810 --> 00:36:54.050
[audience laughing]

806
00:36:54.130 --> 00:36:56.610
Even the victim is like,
"This is impressive. Carry on. Please."


807
00:36:56.690 --> 00:36:57.850
[audience laughing]

808
00:36:57.930 --> 00:37:00.130
"Just use the dotted side.
I enjoy the exfoliation."


809
00:37:00.210 --> 00:37:01.730
[audience laughing]

810
00:37:01.810 --> 00:37:05.490
We're beaten so much in school,
we don't remember anything from school.


811
00:37:06.090 --> 00:37:09.290
All Indians just remember
one useless equation


812
00:37:09.370 --> 00:37:12.210
and turns out it's a metaphor
for our entire lives.


813
00:37:12.770 --> 00:37:16.530
For some reason,
every Indian here tonight remembers


814
00:37:17.210 --> 00:37:22.610
-that a plus b whole square…
-[audience cheering, applauding]


815
00:37:22.770 --> 00:37:24.610
Ready? Yeah?

816
00:37:25.330 --> 00:37:27.050
-Deep breath.
-[audience laughing]


817
00:37:27.130 --> 00:37:29.490
-[audience] Is equal to--
-Not yet! [chuckles]


818
00:37:29.570 --> 00:37:32.050
-[audience laughing]
-[shivers]


819
00:37:32.970 --> 00:37:36.170
-Having, like, a mathematical monsoon.
-[audience laughing]


820
00:37:36.250 --> 00:37:38.250
-Wait for me, man.
-[audience laughing]


821
00:37:38.450 --> 00:37:42.530
All right, here we go.
A plus b whole square is equal to


822
00:37:42.650 --> 00:37:45.210
-A square plus b square…
-[audience] A square plus b square


823
00:37:45.290 --> 00:37:47.250
-plus 2ab.
-…plus 2ab.


824
00:37:47.330 --> 00:37:50.090
-Why do we remember this shit?
-[audience laughing]


825
00:37:50.170 --> 00:37:52.130
But there are three types
of people in the world.


826
00:37:52.890 --> 00:37:58.170
-Those who know about the 2ab.
-[audience laughing, applauding]


827
00:37:58.250 --> 00:38:00.650
-Those who forgot about the 2ab.
-[audience laughing]


828
00:38:00.730 --> 00:38:05.770
-And guys who think the 2ab is magic.
-[audience laughing]


829
00:38:05.850 --> 00:38:07.930
And we made the third guy--
I can't even-- I am not--


830
00:38:08.050 --> 00:38:11.050
[audience cheering, applauding]

831
00:38:16.650 --> 00:38:19.930
What happens to you in school
will stay with you your entire lives?


832
00:38:20.090 --> 00:38:21.490
-[audience] Yes.
-Sexually?


833
00:38:21.770 --> 00:38:24.570
-[audience laughing]
-You bailed on me. I am disappointed.


834
00:38:25.650 --> 00:38:27.810
-Can I do a sex story now? Yeah?
-[audience cheering]


835
00:38:27.970 --> 00:38:30.010
So, check this out. I was hooking up
with this girl, all right?


836
00:38:30.090 --> 00:38:31.330
[audience laughing]

837
00:38:31.410 --> 00:38:35.930
And, like, I was like, "What do you like?"
And she was like, "Vir, choke me."


838
00:38:36.170 --> 00:38:38.890
-[audience laughing, applauding]
-And I was like, "No!"


839
00:38:38.970 --> 00:38:40.890
[audience laughing]

840
00:38:40.970 --> 00:38:43.410
And she's like, "It's my fetish.
I want you to choke me."


841
00:38:43.650 --> 00:38:48.410
-And I was like, "No means no!"
-[audience laughing]


842
00:38:48.530 --> 00:38:50.610
And she's like,
"Ooh, what are you? Sensitive?"


843
00:38:50.690 --> 00:38:53.890
-And I was like, "No, I am famous!"
-[audience laughing]


844
00:38:53.970 --> 00:38:57.650
And she's like, "I give you consent.
Choke me." So, I was like, "Fine."


845
00:38:58.690 --> 00:39:00.690
So, three weeks later,
after lawyers had drawn up, like,


846
00:39:00.770 --> 00:39:01.850
non-disclosure agreements,

847
00:39:01.930 --> 00:39:03.770
-stamp paper notary.
-[audience laughing]


848
00:39:03.850 --> 00:39:06.810
And she's like, "Now is your moment."
And I went like… [mumbles]


849
00:39:06.890 --> 00:39:09.970
-[audience laughing]
-Scary for the choker also.


850
00:39:10.850 --> 00:39:13.690
She's like, "Come on, be a man!"
[chuckles] I was like, "Fine!"


851
00:39:14.330 --> 00:39:18.530
-[audience laughing]
-"You like that, Mrs. Patel?"


852
00:39:18.610 --> 00:39:21.010
[audience laughing, applauding]

853
00:39:21.090 --> 00:39:23.290
She was like,
"Who the fuck is Mrs. Patel?"


854
00:39:23.850 --> 00:39:25.970
I am like, "That's my Maths teacher
from class nine."


855
00:39:26.050 --> 00:39:30.570
[audience laughing, applauding]

856
00:39:30.650 --> 00:39:33.370
She's like, "Is this sexual for you?"

857
00:39:34.090 --> 00:39:36.290
I was like, "No, it's mostly justice.
But you do you, madam."


858
00:39:36.370 --> 00:39:40.850
[audience laughing, applauding]

859
00:39:41.530 --> 00:39:44.730
I was once beaten by a prefect two weeks
in a row with a hockey stick.


860
00:39:44.810 --> 00:39:45.770
I don't wanna say his name.

861
00:39:45.850 --> 00:39:48.370
I don't want legal trouble.
It was Mohit Singhal and…


862
00:39:48.450 --> 00:39:52.330
[audience laughing, applauding]

863
00:39:55.930 --> 00:39:59.370
There was a debate happening in school.
This boy was ten years older than I was.


864
00:39:59.450 --> 00:40:03.050
I remember he went up on stage
and began his debate with a joke.


865
00:40:03.130 --> 00:40:05.610
The joke was this.
"Good evening, everyone."


866
00:40:05.810 --> 00:40:08.690
"You're walking in the jungle
and you meet a lion."


867
00:40:08.770 --> 00:40:09.810
"What time is it?"

868
00:40:09.890 --> 00:40:14.610
-[grunts] "Time to run."
-[audience laughing]


869
00:40:17.570 --> 00:40:19.570
I still can't tell you
why I raised my hand.


870
00:40:19.650 --> 00:40:23.810
-[audience laughing]
-I went up on stage to ask him a question.


871
00:40:24.730 --> 00:40:26.570
I remember holding onto this microphone

872
00:40:26.650 --> 00:40:30.170
and feeling something
I'd never felt before. Strength.


873
00:40:31.250 --> 00:40:33.850
You know, I couldn't sit
but suddenly I could stand.


874
00:40:34.730 --> 00:40:37.210
Looking at this boy
who was ten years older than I was,


875
00:40:37.290 --> 00:40:40.810
and seeing something
I had never seen before. Fear.


876
00:40:40.890 --> 00:40:44.210
-[audience laughing]
-And letting it fill me up.


877
00:40:44.330 --> 00:40:47.090
I mean, call it courage,
call it what you like. Right?


878
00:40:47.970 --> 00:40:50.650
And somehow being able to be like,
"I just want to tell you…"


879
00:40:50.770 --> 00:40:52.050
[audience laughing]

880
00:40:52.130 --> 00:40:56.330
"…Mohit Singhal,
that if you are walking in the jungle


881
00:40:57.010 --> 00:41:00.650
and you meet a lion, it's not time to run,
it's time to die, bitch."


882
00:41:00.730 --> 00:41:02.730
-Now…
-[audience laughing]


883
00:41:02.810 --> 00:41:06.250
…the school laughed! 
My God, they laughed.

884
00:41:06.490 --> 00:41:08.730
And I learnt the most
important lesson of my life


885
00:41:08.810 --> 00:41:10.570
that words have meaning.

886
00:41:10.970 --> 00:41:15.370
Words cause and defeat violence.
Words are memorable.


887
00:41:15.530 --> 00:41:18.530
I was on cloud nine as I walked
to dinner that evening.


888
00:41:18.930 --> 00:41:22.250
And something came out of a bush
and pulled me into that bush.


889
00:41:22.570 --> 00:41:25.370
-And it was Mohit Singhal.
-[audience laughing]


890
00:41:25.450 --> 00:41:31.450
-And he said, "What time is it?"
-[audience laughing, applauding]


891
00:41:33.530 --> 00:41:37.050
-And I said, "Time to die." [chuckles]
-[audience laughing, applauding]


892
00:41:37.210 --> 00:41:38.970
He beat me for two more hours,

893
00:41:39.050 --> 00:41:40.930
but he couldn't beat
the smile off my face.


894
00:41:41.010 --> 00:41:44.570
I remember just lying on the floor,
bleeding uncontrollably,


895
00:41:44.650 --> 00:41:48.090
just laughing because I was like,
"Oh, shit, I deserve this."


896
00:41:48.170 --> 00:41:50.770
-[audience laughing]
-"But this is funny."


897
00:41:51.930 --> 00:41:55.210
"I can see jokes from here.
I think I like it here."


898
00:41:56.410 --> 00:41:58.890
I belong on the floor.
The floor is my home.


899
00:41:58.970 --> 00:42:04.010
And this is freedom. I swear to God.
It is! It is freedom that I think about,


900
00:42:04.570 --> 00:42:07.050
that I obsess about
on an Air India flight…


901
00:42:07.610 --> 00:42:10.930
-[audience laughing]
-…from Newark to Mumbai.


902
00:42:11.010 --> 00:42:11.970
[audience cheering]

903
00:42:12.050 --> 00:42:14.250
An Air India air hostess
offers me a glass of gin.


904
00:42:14.330 --> 00:42:16.490
I refuse. She says,
"Mr. Das, come with me."


905
00:42:17.410 --> 00:42:21.370
Takes me to the front of the plane.
In the silence of a sleeping aircraft,


906
00:42:21.450 --> 00:42:24.530
this old lady puts her arms around me
and I start to cry.


907
00:42:24.610 --> 00:42:29.090
And she just comforts me like a pro.
Like this happens every day on Air India.


908
00:42:29.170 --> 00:42:32.170
[audience laughing]

909
00:42:32.250 --> 00:42:34.250
Possibly after people try
the non-veg meal.


910
00:42:34.330 --> 00:42:38.570
[audience laughing, applauding]

911
00:42:38.650 --> 00:42:41.730
And she is like,
"I saw the video. I loved it."


912
00:42:42.010 --> 00:42:44.610
"Now, whatever happens,
you stand up straight, son!"


913
00:42:44.930 --> 00:42:46.770
"I know exactly
what you are going through."


914
00:42:47.050 --> 00:42:49.090
And I say, "Auntie, with all due respect…"

915
00:42:49.210 --> 00:42:50.530
[audience laughing]

916
00:42:50.610 --> 00:42:52.010
[chuckles] "…I am not sure you do."

917
00:42:52.570 --> 00:42:55.810
And she says, "Don't be silly.
Don't you and me have the same job?"


918
00:42:56.570 --> 00:42:59.690
"We're both just expected
to serve angry uncles."


919
00:42:59.850 --> 00:43:02.370
[audience laughing]

920
00:43:02.450 --> 00:43:09.410
[audience cheering, applauding]

921
00:43:10.370 --> 00:43:12.930
Sometimes all you need in life
is an Air India auntie, you know?


922
00:43:13.010 --> 00:43:15.170
-[audience laughing]
-And I-- Look, I'm not arrogant, New York.


923
00:43:15.250 --> 00:43:17.730
I know why the uncles are angry.
I get it. Right?


924
00:43:17.810 --> 00:43:20.890
They love their country.
I would never judge anybody for that.


925
00:43:20.970 --> 00:43:22.130
Do you love your country? Yeah?

926
00:43:22.210 --> 00:43:24.890
-[audience cheering]
-Well, most of them love their country.


927
00:43:25.130 --> 00:43:28.570
-The rest are nationalists but…
-[audience laughing]


928
00:43:28.690 --> 00:43:30.970
-We'll unpack it.
-[man] Whoo!


929
00:43:31.570 --> 00:43:32.690
In every country in the world

930
00:43:32.770 --> 00:43:34.930
there are patriots
and there are nationalists.


931
00:43:35.330 --> 00:43:38.330
Patriots love their country
and just do things about it.


932
00:43:38.810 --> 00:43:41.810
Nationalists love themselves
and the cult of themselves


933
00:43:41.890 --> 00:43:43.970
and they use their country
to advertise it.


934
00:43:44.090 --> 00:43:46.050
It's just narcissism with a flag.

935
00:43:46.130 --> 00:43:48.890
Don't ever let anyone tell you
how to love your own country.


936
00:43:48.970 --> 00:43:55.130
-[inhales sharply]
-[audience cheering, applauding]


937
00:43:56.730 --> 00:43:59.970
Now, that feels like information

938
00:44:00.050 --> 00:44:03.250
that you will soon speak at a party
and pass off as your own.


939
00:44:03.330 --> 00:44:08.250
-[audience laughing]
-It is fine but if you ever are in danger,


940
00:44:08.650 --> 00:44:10.170
and people start beating you
and they are like,


941
00:44:10.250 --> 00:44:12.130
"Where the fuck did you
learn this nonsense?"


942
00:44:12.290 --> 00:44:16.490
I need you to remember that
my name is Aziz Ansari. All right?


943
00:44:16.570 --> 00:44:18.810
[audience laughing]

944
00:44:18.890 --> 00:44:23.490
[audience applauding, cheering]

945
00:44:24.290 --> 00:44:27.530
-Or Hasan Minhaj.
-[audience laughing, cheering]


946
00:44:27.610 --> 00:44:31.410
-Same passport.
-[audience laughing]


947
00:44:32.130 --> 00:44:35.010
We arrive in Mumbai drunk on gin.
Well done, Auntie.


948
00:44:35.850 --> 00:44:38.410
There are 200 paparazzi
waiting for us at the airport.


949
00:44:38.490 --> 00:44:40.770
I am no way even
near that kind of famous.

950
00:44:41.130 --> 00:44:43.770
They follow us
across the airport in silence.


951
00:44:44.570 --> 00:44:47.210
They wait outside our house
for ten days in silence.


952
00:44:47.290 --> 00:44:48.930
It is just silent.

953
00:44:49.850 --> 00:44:53.170
After ten days, I call my lawyers
and I am like, "Are we okay?"


954
00:44:53.250 --> 00:44:54.890
And they are like,
"Yeah, we are rich, bitch."


955
00:44:54.970 --> 00:45:01.250
-And I am like, "Not you! Am I okay?"
-[audience laughing, applauding]


956
00:45:02.730 --> 00:45:04.450
They are like,
"Vir, these are police cases."


957
00:45:04.530 --> 00:45:05.530
"The police will decide

958
00:45:05.650 --> 00:45:07.810
whether to convert them
into charge sheets or not."


959
00:45:08.810 --> 00:45:11.290
It takes 35 very long days.

960
00:45:12.370 --> 00:45:14.490
In seven different
police stations in India,


961
00:45:15.250 --> 00:45:19.210
in seven different cities,
the police are shown my video.


962
00:45:19.330 --> 00:45:22.210
One by one they all say,
"This is not a problem."


963
00:45:22.290 --> 00:45:25.050
"We agree with this man.
We are not going to take action."


964
00:45:25.130 --> 00:45:28.690
-[audience cheering, applauding]
-I…


965
00:45:31.930 --> 00:45:34.410
And it's actually kind of breath-taking
if you think about it.


966
00:45:34.530 --> 00:45:39.850
Comedians aren't brave.
The police! Now, that is punching up!


967
00:45:40.770 --> 00:45:45.450
[audience applauding, cheering]

968
00:45:45.530 --> 00:45:48.130
On the night that I was called
a terrorist in my home country,


969
00:45:48.210 --> 00:45:49.930
I was nominated for an Emmy Award.

970
00:45:50.010 --> 00:45:53.690
-[inhales] I was… [chuckles]
-[audience cheering, applauding]


971
00:45:56.290 --> 00:45:59.570
I was in New York for the Emmys
for a show called<i>Vir Das: For India</i>


972
00:45:59.650 --> 00:46:03.330
-for which I already had a legal case.
-[audience laughing]


973
00:46:03.410 --> 00:46:05.530
By the time I walked the red carpet,
I had seven more.


974
00:46:05.610 --> 00:46:07.770
-[audience laughing]
-So, I just had to fake it, right?


975
00:46:07.850 --> 00:46:09.370
I was on the red carpet
and they were like,


976
00:46:09.450 --> 00:46:12.490
"Vir, how does it feel
to be in America right now?"


977
00:46:12.570 --> 00:46:14.970
And I'm like, "It's good to be
outside of India. I am not gonna lie."


978
00:46:15.050 --> 00:46:18.170
-[audience laughing, applauding]
-It's good to be traveling.


979
00:46:18.810 --> 00:46:21.290
"Do you feel like people
are excited for you back home?"


980
00:46:21.370 --> 00:46:24.090
-"Well, they are not calm."
-[audience laughing]


981
00:46:24.170 --> 00:46:25.810
"What are you gonna say if you win?"

982
00:46:26.410 --> 00:46:29.690
-"'Help!' I don't know!"
-[audience laughing]


983
00:46:29.890 --> 00:46:32.450
I just remember feeling
an intense sense of shame.


984
00:46:32.930 --> 00:46:36.090
"God, please don't let me win.
It will really piss them off. Please!"


985
00:46:36.450 --> 00:46:38.370
"Don't let me win.
It will really piss them off."


986
00:46:38.450 --> 00:46:40.770
And then I didn't win
and it just pissed me off.


987
00:46:40.850 --> 00:46:44.370
-[audience laughing]
-I lost to this big French show


988
00:46:44.450 --> 00:46:47.410
and there were all these gorgeous
French men walking around


989
00:46:47.490 --> 00:46:49.130
and they had heard what happened to me.

990
00:46:49.570 --> 00:46:51.890
And they came over and were like,
"We heard what happened to you."


991
00:46:51.970 --> 00:46:54.170
-"It must be very stressful."
-[audience laughing]


992
00:46:54.250 --> 00:46:56.530
"Listen, many of us are going
to have sex later tonight."


993
00:46:56.610 --> 00:46:58.050
-[audience laughing]
-"You are…


994
00:46:58.130 --> 00:47:01.370
You're a beautiful man. You can join.
We will relieve your stress."


995
00:47:01.850 --> 00:47:06.010
[audience laughing]

996
00:47:06.090 --> 00:47:10.770
And I was like, "You're having an orgy
to celebrate your Emmy?"


997
00:47:11.130 --> 00:47:12.930
And he's like, "No,
it's Monday, so…" [mumbles]


998
00:47:13.010 --> 00:47:15.170
[audience laughing]

999
00:47:15.250 --> 00:47:17.170
I am like, "You know, sir,
I appreciate the offer,


1000
00:47:17.250 --> 00:47:18.530
but like, if I get caught,

1001
00:47:18.610 --> 00:47:20.770
that's a very bad headline
for me right now."


1002
00:47:20.850 --> 00:47:21.850
[audience laughing]

1003
00:47:21.930 --> 00:47:25.290
"Vir Das ostracized and sodomized
by two different countries."


1004
00:47:25.370 --> 00:47:28.690
-[audience laughing]
-Two very different penal codes.


1005
00:47:28.770 --> 00:47:33.770
[audience laughing, applauding]

1006
00:47:34.130 --> 00:47:36.450
He is like, "No, I understand,
but if you don't want to,


1007
00:47:36.530 --> 00:47:38.410
then there is a field next door.
You…" [chuckles]


1008
00:47:38.490 --> 00:47:42.330
[audience laughing, applauding]

1009
00:47:42.410 --> 00:47:45.650
Every time I get nominated for an award,
some shit goes down.


1010
00:47:45.930 --> 00:47:49.250
Ten years ago, I was nominated
for a Filmfare Award.


1011
00:47:49.370 --> 00:47:53.410
-[audience cheering]
-Your ironic response is appropriate.


1012
00:47:53.490 --> 00:47:54.570
[audience laughing]

1013
00:47:54.650 --> 00:47:56.890
Filmfare Awards, guys,
are a very big deal.


1014
00:47:56.970 --> 00:47:59.210
-They are like our Oscar Awards.
-[audience laughing]


1015
00:47:59.290 --> 00:48:01.610
Except the Oscars
are way more expensive to buy.


1016
00:48:02.410 --> 00:48:03.890
-[audience laughing]
-I'd never been before.


1017
00:48:03.970 --> 00:48:07.330
So, Filmfare sent me a pass
that sticks to the inside of your car.


1018
00:48:07.610 --> 00:48:12.570
The pass says V-V-V-VIP.
Full form, VVVVIP!!


1019
00:48:12.650 --> 00:48:15.410
[audience laughing]

1020
00:48:15.490 --> 00:48:18.370
I'd never been, so I stuck the pass
on the outside of my windscreen.


1021
00:48:18.450 --> 00:48:21.370
-[audience laughing]
-I am on the Western Express Highway.


1022
00:48:22.530 --> 00:48:27.970
Out of the corner of my eye,
I see a V-V-V-VIP pass go vvvvip…


1023
00:48:28.050 --> 00:48:30.890
-[audience laughing]
-…stick to an auto rickshaw and fuck off.


1024
00:48:31.970 --> 00:48:34.930
This is what I mean
about Indian privilege. Very volatile.


1025
00:48:35.010 --> 00:48:36.930
[audience laughing]

1026
00:48:37.010 --> 00:48:40.650
I, meanwhile, am stuck outside
the gates of Filmcity trying to convince


1027
00:48:40.850 --> 00:48:44.050
the security guard that
I am an actor in movies. [chuckles]


1028
00:48:44.210 --> 00:48:46.530
And I swear to God, verbatim,
he looks at me and he's like,


1029
00:48:46.610 --> 00:48:49.250
"If you are an actor in movies,
I am an actor in movies."


1030
00:48:49.330 --> 00:48:53.050
[audience laughing, applauding]

1031
00:48:53.130 --> 00:48:56.210
So, now, I spend another hour
trying to convince the security guard


1032
00:48:56.290 --> 00:48:58.970
-that he could be an actor in movies.
-[audience laughing]


1033
00:48:59.050 --> 00:49:01.050
And he's like, "No, sir,
if I can be an actor in movies,


1034
00:49:01.130 --> 00:49:02.770
-you can be an actor in movies."
-[audience laughing]


1035
00:49:02.850 --> 00:49:04.250
And he's like, "What?"
And I am like, "What?"


1036
00:49:04.330 --> 00:49:07.690
-And I go inside. I am a Jedi.
-[audience laughing]


1037
00:49:07.770 --> 00:49:11.170
As I get to the Filmfare Awards,
they tell me that my producer, Aamir Khan,


1038
00:49:11.250 --> 00:49:14.810
has boycotted these awards.
Has not submitted any footage of mine


1039
00:49:14.890 --> 00:49:16.890
to play for when they announce
my nomination.


1040
00:49:16.970 --> 00:49:18.530
-[audience laughing]
-Yeah!


1041
00:49:19.050 --> 00:49:21.290
Americans, you will not know
who these actors are,


1042
00:49:21.370 --> 00:49:24.450
but they are very, very talented.
Deserve their nominations.


1043
00:49:25.090 --> 00:49:27.210
The lights get dim.
They are like, "And now,


1044
00:49:27.890 --> 00:49:33.290

at the Manikchand Pan Pasand…"

This was my in-memoriam moment of silence.
Everybody got all sad and shit.


1064
00:51:04.650 --> 00:51:07.250
They stood up. They were like,
"Oh, my God, he died so young."

-[audience laughing]
-"Who is he?"


1066
00:51:09.850 --> 00:51:12.170
Then they put the camera on me.
I didn't know what to do.


1067
00:51:12.250 --> 00:51:14.770
So, I mourned myself.
I am like, "Dead, dead, dead."

[audience laughing, applauding]

I thought about it the night of the Emmys.

00:51:30.650 --> 00:51:31.930
[clears throat] Look.

1073
00:51:34.090 --> 00:51:35.090
I would not wish…

1074
00:51:37.970 --> 00:51:40.770
feeling like you have let
your country down on my worst enemy.


1075
00:51:40.850 --> 00:51:43.730
I wouldn't. And I-
- [hesitates]

1076
00:51:43.810 --> 00:51:46.530
I was clear that day and I am clear
standing before you right now.


1077
00:51:46.610 --> 00:51:48.410
If I have ever
created a world in which

1078
00:51:49.090 --> 00:51:52.410
I don't get to touch a microphone,
I have zero interest in that world.


1079
00:51:54.130 --> 00:51:55.250
I just remember standing like--

1080
00:51:55.330 --> 00:51:58.930
I was at this fancy hotel called
The Beekman in New York and every floor--


1081
00:51:59.010 --> 00:52:01.170
It was hollow on the inside
and it overlooked the lobby


1082
00:52:01.250 --> 00:52:04.090
and I just remember standing
on my floor just thinking,


1083
00:52:04.170 --> 00:52:06.090
"Oh, I fucked it up. I…"

1084
00:52:07.130 --> 00:52:09.170
"They are never gonna let me--
I should jump."


1085
00:52:09.290 --> 00:52:11.450
"You know,
I'm in this fancy Emmy outfit--"


1086
00:52:11.530 --> 00:52:13.450
"They can send me off
in the outfit. It's perfect."


1087
00:52:13.530 --> 00:52:14.410
[audience laughing]

1088
00:52:14.730 --> 00:52:18.050
But then I remembered that my wife
is sleeping in the other room


1089
00:52:18.130 --> 00:52:22.690
-and that's an awkward checkout.
-[audience laughing]


1090
00:52:22.770 --> 00:52:25.210
-From the hotel.

00:52:25.290 --> 00:52:26.210
And life.

1092
00:52:27.250 --> 00:52:28.890
Plus, this is a
hotel in New York City.

1093
00:52:28.970 --> 00:52:30.890
If I just land in the lobby…
[imitates crash]


1094
00:52:30.970 --> 00:52:33.450
I'll scare the shit out of three countries
minimum, right? [chuckles]


1095
00:52:33.530 --> 00:52:35.890
-[audience laughing]
-[chuckling] Some British person is like,


1096
00:52:36.010 --> 00:52:38.770
"All right, yeah, do you have Netflix?"
[imitates crash]


1097
00:52:39.450 --> 00:52:41.290
"I am sorry. There is a dead Indian
in the lobby here."

[audience laughing]

1099
00:52:42.570 --> 00:52:44.970
"What's going on? Do they want
independence again? What's up?"


1100
00:52:45.090 --> 00:52:47.690
[audience laughing, applauding]

1101
00:52:47.890 --> 00:52:49.370
Two American girls are at the bar.

1102
00:52:49.450 --> 00:52:52.210
Just like, "Angela,
he doesn't deserve you."


1103
00:52:52.290 --> 00:52:55.970

1107
00:53:05.890 --> 00:53:09.010
Some kid is on Instagram in the lobby.
Suddenly… [imitates crash]


1108
00:53:09.410 --> 00:53:10.450

I have mouths to f…"

They are like, "Vir, nobody will work

"You have a social media following.

-[inhales] Drugs.
-[audience laughing]


1129
00:54:13.810 --> 00:54:16.090
I got high as balls. 
I smoked weed.

1130
00:54:16.610 --> 00:54:18.970
And when I did, I remembered
why I don't smoke weed.

[audience laughing]

1132
00:54:20.210 --> 00:54:24.290
It's because weed doesn't relax me.
It just makes me erect and afraid.


1133
00:54:24.370 --> 00:54:28.650
-[audience laughing]
-Which is my least favorite kind of erect.

00:54:53.250 --> 00:54:55.770
I can't even commit suicide
because all I keep thinking about is,


1143
00:54:55.850 --> 00:54:58.050
what if I jump, land

After two months, my family is allowed
to turn our phones on again.


1153
00:55:24.650 --> 00:55:28.130
They explode. It's not hatred. It's love.

Millions and millions of messages
of kindness from across the world.

people meet you with love,

with suspicion and resentment.

I thought you didn't exist!"

a little bit. [chuckles]

00:56:17.570 --> 00:56:19.250
And you realize that…

1169
00:56:20.850 --> 00:56:23.370
hate is yelled but love is felt.

1170
00:56:24.570 --> 00:56:28.330
It is unfair to expect people
to yell love.


1171
00:56:28.490 --> 00:56:31.210
You should just be grateful
that they feel it in the first place


1172
00:56:31.290 --> 00:56:34.090
and then trust that it will always
outlast the hate.


1173
00:56:34.170 --> 00:56:37.010
And that's not even history.
That's just basic <i>Harry Potter.</i>


1174
00:56:37.290 --> 00:56:39.370
[audience laughing]

1175
00:56:39.450 --> 00:56:41.850
But if you are ever
at the receiving end of hate,


1176
00:56:42.130 --> 00:56:44.850
or feel like your nation is lost in it,
from my family to you,


1177
00:56:44.930 --> 00:56:48.210
I just want you to know that
love is always playing right underneath.


1178
00:56:48.290 --> 00:56:50.650
You just can't hear it in the darkness.

1179
00:56:50.730 --> 00:56:52.890
You got to hang out till sunlight
and you'll hear it.


1180
00:56:53.250 --> 00:56:55.570
It's soft but it's not weak.
I promise you.


1181
00:56:55.650 --> 00:56:58.330
The problem is,
they just both play at the same time.


1182
00:56:58.410 --> 00:57:00.730
It's almost like
we come from two… [inhales]


1183
00:57:01.370 --> 00:57:03.930
[audience laughing]

1184
00:57:04.050 --> 00:57:10.730
[audience applauding, cheering]

1185
00:57:14.210 --> 00:57:17.170
-I don't repeat jokes.
-[audience laughing]


1186
00:57:17.290 --> 00:57:19.410
And then what? You are supposed
to go back to doing this again


1187
00:57:19.490 --> 00:57:21.530
like nothing ever happened, but it did.

1188
00:57:22.450 --> 00:57:25.810
I mourned my whole career.
I never thought I'd see you again.


1189
00:57:27.570 --> 00:57:30.130
So, now, you and me,
back in the same room together.


1190
00:57:30.610 --> 00:57:32.130
This is an unplanned blessing

1191
00:57:32.210 --> 00:57:35.250
that I could not be more
grateful for in my heart.


1192
00:57:35.330 --> 00:57:37.090
-[audience cheering]
-[hesitates]


1193
00:57:37.170 --> 00:57:41.530
But it's… It's different.
I have nothing left to lose.


1194
00:57:42.570 --> 00:57:44.010
I have no one left to impress.

1195
00:57:44.090 --> 00:57:48.370
I will never be mainstream
or cool again. I am finished.


1196
00:57:49.730 --> 00:57:50.730
But I am free.

1197
00:57:52.250 --> 00:57:56.410
It's like for the longest time you and me,
we just co-existed, right? A plus b!


1198
00:57:56.490 --> 00:57:59.690
[audience laughing, applauding]

1199
00:57:59.770 --> 00:58:02.450
And then some shit happened
and somebody whole squared us.


1200
00:58:02.610 --> 00:58:06.250
-[audience laughing]
-And now I feel like b square


1201
00:58:06.330 --> 00:58:09.370
and all I wanna do
is make you feel like a square.


1202
00:58:09.450 --> 00:58:13.290
And whatever happens next,
the sound of your laughter, that's 2ab.


1203
00:58:13.410 --> 00:58:20.410
-We can make magic together.
-[audience cheering, applauding]


1204
00:58:24.370 --> 00:58:28.410
I will never defame India
on foreign soil ever again.


1205
00:58:29.330 --> 00:58:32.170
So now, I just carry Indian soil
with me wherever I go.


1206
00:58:32.250 --> 00:58:37.930
[audience cheering, applauding]

1207
00:58:48.170 --> 00:58:50.890
Tonight, you are watching the performance
from a comedian from Mumbai


1208
00:58:50.970 --> 00:58:53.450
on the actual sands of Juhu Beach…

1209
00:58:53.530 --> 00:58:58.610
-[audience cheering, applauding]
-…that I travel with.


1210
00:58:58.770 --> 00:59:01.010
Every single time I made fun
of my country tonight,


1211
00:59:01.090 --> 00:59:03.530
I made sure
I was standing on Indian soil.


1212
00:59:03.610 --> 00:59:05.690
-[audience laughing]
-I timed every word to my feet.


1213
00:59:05.770 --> 00:59:07.690
Don't believe me?
Watch my special again!


1214
00:59:07.770 --> 00:59:09.250
[audience laughing]

1215
00:59:09.330 --> 00:59:11.810
This is an awkward conversation
with customs by the way.


1216
00:59:13.130 --> 00:59:16.170
They are just like, "Sir, why are you
traveling with a suitcase full of sand?"


1217
00:59:16.250 --> 00:59:18.410
-I am like, "Patriotism!"
-[audience laughing]


1218
00:59:18.490 --> 00:59:21.730
There aren't even that many airlines that
will let you check in a bag full of sand.


1219
00:59:22.290 --> 00:59:26.850
-But there is one!
-[audience cheering, applauding]


1220
00:59:26.930 --> 00:59:29.890
I don't care where I go from here,
I take Mumbai sand with me.


1221
00:59:29.970 --> 00:59:31.890
And we are flying Air India,
ladies and gentlemen.


1222
00:59:31.970 --> 00:59:34.810
-[audience cheering, applauding]
-And if you have ever flown Emirates,


1223
00:59:34.890 --> 00:59:37.010
you know what a goddamn
compromise that is.


1224
00:59:37.090 --> 00:59:39.530
-[audience laughing]
-Have you flown Emirates here?


1225
00:59:39.650 --> 00:59:40.770
-[audience cheering]
-[mumbles]


1226
00:59:40.850 --> 00:59:43.770
-Maybe not you guys but still, you know.
-[audience laughing]


1227
00:59:43.850 --> 00:59:46.410
-[chuckles] I am sorry.
-[audience applauding]


1228
00:59:46.490 --> 00:59:48.690
Just getting emotional.
I had to bring it back. I am sorry.


1229
00:59:48.890 --> 00:59:52.250
-I am sure you will, someday.
-[audience laughing, cheering]


1230
00:59:52.370 --> 00:59:54.090
-Just work hard.
-[audience laughing]


1231
00:59:54.170 --> 00:59:56.650
-Or sleep with these guys.
-[audience laughing]


1232
00:59:56.730 --> 01:00:00.330
[audience cheering, applauding]

1233
01:00:00.410 --> 01:00:03.410
This is my final story for the evening.
It is a very privileged story.


1234
01:00:03.490 --> 01:00:05.650
But I will endear myself to you
through the course of this story.


1235
01:00:05.730 --> 01:00:08.570
-Are we ready? Yeah?
-[audience cheering]


1236
01:00:08.650 --> 01:00:10.610
So, I was flying first-class
on Emirates, guys.


1237
01:00:10.690 --> 01:00:12.410
-And, uh…
-[audience laughing]


1238
01:00:12.490 --> 01:00:14.850
That first-class seat is tremendous.
Have you seen it? Yeah?


1239
01:00:15.250 --> 01:00:19.210
-You walk by it on your way to…
-[audience laughing]


1240
01:00:19.450 --> 01:00:22.690
Airhostess is one of the most
beautiful women I have ever seen.


1241
01:00:22.770 --> 01:00:25.410
She comes up. She is like,
"Mr. Das, there's a shower."


1242
01:00:26.930 --> 01:00:29.410
Would you like to shower
an hour before landing


1243
01:00:29.490 --> 01:00:31.330
or two hours before landing?"

1244
01:00:31.410 --> 01:00:35.850
And I was so taken with her beauty.
I thought she meant with her.


1245
01:00:35.930 --> 01:00:37.730
[audience laughing, applauding]

1246
01:00:37.810 --> 01:00:39.850
I was like, "Madam, this is the number
one airline in the world."


1247
01:00:39.930 --> 01:00:41.130
[audience laughing]

1248
01:00:41.210 --> 01:00:42.850
"UNESCO voted number one
airline in the world."


1249
01:00:42.930 --> 01:00:44.610
-[audience laughing]
-[chuckles]


1250
01:00:44.690 --> 01:00:48.290
Then you go to first class.
There's a bathroom in first class!


1251
01:00:48.370 --> 01:00:51.570
It's the size of an apartment!
Your apartment. But still, you know…


1252
01:00:51.650 --> 01:00:53.850
[audience laughing, applauding]

1253
01:00:53.930 --> 01:00:56.970
They give you one towel.
You get naked. I start to…


1254
01:00:57.170 --> 01:00:59.210
This is not how I shower.
I am sorry. [chuckles]


1255
01:00:59.290 --> 01:01:00.210
[audience laughing]

1256
01:01:00.290 --> 01:01:02.290
All Indians don't shower
in Bollywood movies.


1257
01:01:02.370 --> 01:01:03.650
That's not how this works.

1258
01:01:03.970 --> 01:01:06.890
No, I just get the soap, right?
And I am <i>jhaaging</i> up and…


1259
01:01:06.970 --> 01:01:10.610
-[audience laughing]
-What the fuck?


1260
01:01:10.690 --> 01:01:12.210
[audience laughing]

1261
01:01:12.290 --> 01:01:14.250
What do you say in New York
if you don't say <i>"jhaaging</i> up"?


1262
01:01:14.330 --> 01:01:15.690
-What's the word?
-[woman] Lather?


1263
01:01:15.770 --> 01:01:18.090
Lather? Lather, madam? Lather?

1264
01:01:19.210 --> 01:01:22.450
-With respect-- [spits] All right?
-[audience laughing, applauding]


1265
01:01:22.530 --> 01:01:25.330
-I am very sorry. I don't mean to…
-[audience cheering, applauding]


1266
01:01:25.410 --> 01:01:27.290
But I just-
- Lather has super, like…

1267
01:01:27.450 --> 01:01:30.530
"My name is Sandeep
but call me Sandy" energy, you know?


1268
01:01:30.610 --> 01:01:33.050
-[audience laughing]
-Now, there's a green light.


1269
01:01:33.130 --> 01:01:35.530
I don't see the light go red
because I am a back showerer.


1270
01:01:35.610 --> 01:01:38.410
I don't shower like this.
I shower like that. I like it this way.


1271
01:01:38.490 --> 01:01:41.010
-[audience laughing]
-Really? Just me? Nobody else?


1272
01:01:41.170 --> 01:01:43.530
Yeah? Madam? Yeah? Madam?
There you go.


1273
01:01:43.610 --> 01:01:45.810
I don't like hot liquid
splashing in my face.


1274
01:01:45.890 --> 01:01:47.250
I like it trickling down my ass.

1275
01:01:47.330 --> 01:01:49.850
-Madam? Madam?
-[audience laughing, applauding]


1276
01:01:49.930 --> 01:01:52.250
It's because… [chuckles] …when I…

1277
01:01:53.170 --> 01:01:57.370
Very sorry. When I was growing up,
I didn't have a shower, I had a bucket.


1278
01:01:57.450 --> 01:02:00.330
-[audience laughing]
-Bucket had a hot tap and a cold tap.


1279
01:02:00.450 --> 01:02:03.450
You had to mix the temperature yourself.
To get the temperature right,


1280
01:02:03.530 --> 01:02:06.210
you had to be a thermal
engineer slash psychic.


1281
01:02:06.290 --> 01:02:09.850
[audience laughs, applauds]

1282
01:02:11.970 --> 01:02:14.690
It was always 40 degrees too warm.
So, what did we do?


1283
01:02:14.770 --> 01:02:17.290
Safety position. Take a mug.
Put it on our back.


1284
01:02:17.410 --> 01:02:19.530
Let it trickle down
our back and cool down

1285
01:02:19.610 --> 01:02:21.970
before it cradled our testicles.
This is science!


1286
01:02:22.050 --> 01:02:23.170
[audience laughing]

1287
01:02:23.290 --> 01:02:26.290
You only get ten minutes of water.
This lady didn't tell me that shit.


1288
01:02:26.410 --> 01:02:29.170
When I am at my peak form,
the light goes red and the water goes out.


1289
01:02:29.250 --> 01:02:30.250
[audience laughing]

1290
01:02:30.330 --> 01:02:32.610
I look like I have been molested
by a cloud at this point.


1291
01:02:32.690 --> 01:02:34.690
[audience laughing]

1292
01:02:35.250 --> 01:02:37.010
So now I come out of the shower
to the sink


1293
01:02:37.090 --> 01:02:39.250
with my own personal marshmallow.
[chuckles]


1294
01:02:39.730 --> 01:02:42.330
And I am just doing like a bird bath
type of a situation.


1295
01:02:42.410 --> 01:02:44.370
-[audience laughing]
-But, like, I am not tall enough


1296
01:02:44.450 --> 01:02:46.050
to just lower my junk into the sink

1297
01:02:46.130 --> 01:02:47.850
and give it a casual wash, right?

1298
01:02:49.130 --> 01:02:52.890
So, now I have to take palmfuls
and splash them up into dark places.


1299
01:02:52.970 --> 01:02:55.130
-[audience laughing]
-But the entire bathroom is flooded.


1300
01:02:55.690 --> 01:03:00.250
It is soaking.
And I will not be the Indian man…


1301
01:03:00.330 --> 01:03:01.490
[audience laughing]

1302
01:03:01.570 --> 01:03:04.490
-…who fucked up the bathroom.
-[audience laughing]


1303
01:03:04.570 --> 01:03:09.050
So, now I am naked on all fours
with my one towel


1304
01:03:09.210 --> 01:03:11.730
mopping the Emirate's
first-class bathroom.


1305
01:03:11.810 --> 01:03:14.810
-[audience laughing, applauding]
-Mopping it clean!


1306
01:03:15.850 --> 01:03:18.010
Why? For my country!

1307
01:03:18.170 --> 01:03:20.690
-[audience cheering]
-You call me a traitor?


1308
01:03:22.410 --> 01:03:25.450
-I am a janitor is what I am!
-[audience cheer, applauding]


1309
01:03:25.570 --> 01:03:28.290
