2
00:00:34.939 --> 00:00:39.109
Hi, I'm Brittany. I'm 22 years
old and I'm from Miami, Florida.


3
00:00:44.616 --> 00:00:49.119
Hi, I'm Serena. I'm 19
from Riverside, California.


4
00:00:54.926 --> 00:01:01.465
Hi, guys. My name is Savana
Anna and I'm from Texas.


5
00:01:05.803 --> 00:01:11.643
Hi, boys, or should I say men 'cause
that's exactly why I'm here, to find a man.


6
00:01:11.676 --> 00:01:13.443
My name is Clarissa.

7
00:01:16.346 --> 00:01:22.587
I'm looking for a gentleman who loves
his little Russian princess.


8
00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:33.397
I'm a singer, dancer, actress, you name it.
Entertainment is my thing.


9
00:01:38.235 --> 00:01:42.807
I don't really usually do this,
so this is new for me.


10
00:01:47.879 --> 00:01:53.283
I'm looking for a lovely
gentleman with big old heart.


11
00:01:56.688 --> 00:02:01.959
I am 23 years young and I am ready
to mingle with the right guy.


12
00:02:07.497 --> 00:02:11.769
I love to be spoiled.
I love travelling. I love shopping.


13
00:02:17.474 --> 00:02:20.845
I don't like just staying home
and watching movies.


14
00:02:20.878 --> 00:02:23.948
No offense, but that just sounds
a little clichÃ© to me.


15
00:02:25.983 --> 00:02:30.454
Someone that has
a little more wisdom


16
00:02:30.487 --> 00:02:36.359
and, uh, little more, you know,
thicker wallet maybe.


17
00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:47.270
I went on one of these dates and this guy
went Dutch on me and I was not having it.


18
00:02:52.375 --> 00:02:55.680
I prefer older men because
they tend to have more money


19
00:02:55.713 --> 00:02:57.648
because they have
their priorities in line.


20
00:03:02.787 --> 00:03:07.390
I'm just looking for a guy who's
really nice, fun, good personality


21
00:03:07.424 --> 00:03:09.594
and can take me
on a really nice date.


22
00:03:14.364 --> 00:03:17.835
I don't cook or clean.
Your maid can do that.


23
00:03:22.907 --> 00:03:26.543
I like going to Vegas.
I want a reason to dress up.


24
00:03:26.577 --> 00:03:29.614
I love dressing up. I love shopping.
I like looking good.


25
00:03:41.391 --> 00:03:47.632
Your little Russian princess.
So, swipe right if you like me.


26
00:03:54.005 --> 00:03:56.707
If you like what you see,
swipe right.


27
00:04:02.479 --> 00:04:06.050
Swipe right and maybe you and I could
be right for each other.


28
00:04:09.519 --> 00:04:12.723
If you like what you see,
you can just swipe left.


29
00:04:12.757 --> 00:04:15.827
Um, or, no,
I think it was right.


30
00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:58.896
<i>It all starts
with the perfect selfie.</i>


31
00:05:58.930 --> 00:06:01.632
<i>If you're serious
about being a sugar baby,</i>


32
00:06:01.666 --> 00:06:03.901
<i>you need to treat it
like a full-time job.</i>


33
00:06:15.947 --> 00:06:18.249
Candy. Candy.

34
00:06:18.282 --> 00:06:21.218
Excuse me, Candy,
listen, it is not...


35
00:06:21.252 --> 00:06:25.022
It's not my fault that you
chose to give a client a discount.


36
00:06:25.056 --> 00:06:29.093
And I'm certainly not going to lose
money because you made a stupid choice.


37
00:06:29.126 --> 00:06:31.195
Hold on a second.
Are you Kimberly?


38
00:06:31.228 --> 00:06:34.065
- Yeah, it's me.
- Just give me one second.


39
00:06:34.098 --> 00:06:37.735
If you want to play housewife, I suggest you
take a baking class and quit the business


40
00:06:37.768 --> 00:06:39.536
and leave the money making
to the professionals.


41
00:06:39.569 --> 00:06:42.606
In the meantime,
pay me my fucking money.


42
00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:43.674
Can I get you something?

43
00:06:43.708 --> 00:06:44.875
Water.

44
00:06:44.909 --> 00:06:46.543
Got it.

45
00:06:46.577 --> 00:06:48.779
Please, I can't with you.

46
00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:51.716
I'm sorry. Really sorry.

47
00:06:51.749 --> 00:06:53.684
- I just...
- Don't be.


48
00:06:53.718 --> 00:06:56.187
Did I hear you say discount?

49
00:06:56.220 --> 00:06:59.556
Because does she know that she's only worth
what her cheapest client is willing to pay her?


50
00:06:59.590 --> 00:07:02.693
Oh, my God!
I'm going to write that down.


51
00:07:02.727 --> 00:07:06.163
I can tell we're gonna get along
amazing.


52
00:07:06.197 --> 00:07:09.767
<i>Raquelle proceeded to tell me
about this dating app she was launching.</i>


53
00:07:10.668 --> 00:07:14.972
<i>It matches really attractive
girls like me with rich guys.</i>


54
00:07:15.006 --> 00:07:18.142
<i>he called it</i> Ballers and Babes <i>.</i>

55
00:07:18.175 --> 00:07:20.644
The best part is it's legal.

56
00:07:20.678 --> 00:07:23.546
There's never an agreement
of sex for money.


57
00:07:23.581 --> 00:07:27.885
We all know what the game is but
since it's never actually said.


58
00:07:27.918 --> 00:07:30.187
It's genius.

59
00:07:30.221 --> 00:07:32.723
Mm
-Hm.

60
00:07:32.757 --> 00:07:35.292
And that way, when the girl actually
gets it up, he feels like he's scoring.


61
00:07:35.326 --> 00:07:40.097
And what is it with men and their
obsession for scoring, sports and sex?


62
00:07:40.131 --> 00:07:42.867
You need an app? I know a guy.

63
00:07:47.071 --> 00:07:50.875
<i>The internet has been invaluable
in terms of what it's done for sex.</i>


64
00:07:50.908 --> 00:07:53.878
<i>First, it's revolutionized porn.</i>

65
00:07:53.911 --> 00:07:57.081
<i>As a kid, I would jerk off
to Victoria's Secrets catalog.</i>


66
00:07:57.114 --> 00:07:59.183
<i>These millennials don't know
how good they have it.</i>


67
00:08:01.052 --> 00:08:05.756
<i>And thanks to the prevalence of porn,
the quality of sex has also improved.</i>


68
00:08:05.790 --> 00:08:08.025
<i>It used to be you were lucky
to get head.</i>


69
00:08:08.059 --> 00:08:10.761
<i>Now, it's not even foreplay unless
you're getting at least that.</i>


70
00:08:11.829 --> 00:08:14.198
<i>Now, there are
these sugar daddy sites.</i>


71
00:08:14.231 --> 00:08:18.836
<i>Craigslist and Tinder were an okay
start, guys looking to get laid,</i>


72
00:08:18.869 --> 00:08:21.272
<i>girls who wanted to make
some extra cash.</i>


73
00:08:21.305 --> 00:08:23.374
<i>These sites
cut through all the bullshit.</i>


74
00:08:23.407 --> 00:08:25.643
<i>It's a pure business
arrangement...</i>


75
00:08:25.676 --> 00:08:29.647
<i>hot, young girls and rich guys
looking to exploit each other.</i>


76
00:08:30.381 --> 00:08:32.183
<i>Let the games begin.</i>

77
00:08:36.353 --> 00:08:39.824
- It's a beautiful night.
- Yeah, it is.


78
00:08:41.659 --> 00:08:45.029
Hey, uh, do you think that we could
stop at the Apple store on our way home?


79
00:08:45.062 --> 00:08:46.997
Uh, why?

80
00:08:47.031 --> 00:08:49.300
Well, the new iPhones
just came out.


81
00:08:49.333 --> 00:08:53.637
Didn't I just buy you a new phone
and a new computer last month?


82
00:08:53.671 --> 00:08:56.207
- Yeah.
- Is it really that much different?


83
00:08:56.240 --> 00:08:59.343
Paul, please.

84
00:08:59.376 --> 00:09:03.414
I promise we can go back to your place
and I'll make it worth your while.


85
00:09:03.447 --> 00:09:04.348
Come on.

86
00:09:07.351 --> 00:09:09.386
<i>So, here's how this game works.</i>

87
00:09:09.420 --> 00:09:12.723
<i>The girls try to drag as much
money as they can from a guy</i>


88
00:09:12.756 --> 00:09:15.860
<i>while the guys grab as much pussy
as possible without going broke.</i>


89
00:09:15.893 --> 00:09:18.762
Thank you again for the watch.
It's beautiful.


90
00:09:18.796 --> 00:09:20.831
It was my pleasure.
It's beautiful on you.


91
00:09:23.033 --> 00:09:26.770
Also, I hope you don't think I'm awful
but, uh, tuition is due.


92
00:09:27.905 --> 00:09:30.174
Of course, I got you.

93
00:09:30.207 --> 00:09:33.410
<i>And believe me, these girls
will try every trick in the book.</i>


94
00:09:48.292 --> 00:09:49.426
How's that?

95
00:09:59.403 --> 00:10:01.872
Whenever you guys are ready.
Thanks for stopping in.


96
00:10:01.906 --> 00:10:04.441
Thanks. You got it.

97
00:10:07.811 --> 00:10:09.480
Oh, uh, at least
let me get the tip.


98
00:10:09.513 --> 00:10:11.182
I mean, you've done
so much for me.


99
00:10:11.215 --> 00:10:12.416
Well, yeah, thank you.

100
00:10:15.819 --> 00:10:18.789
- What's this?
- It's a Tip N Split.


101
00:10:18.822 --> 00:10:21.125
It's a... a light, a calculator,
and a magnifier.


102
00:10:21.158 --> 00:10:23.827
It's set specifically
for tipping. It's genius.


103
00:10:25.296 --> 00:10:27.364
- Okay.
- Did you know the average American wastes


104
00:10:27.398 --> 00:10:30.301
almost a thousand dollars a year
in overtipping?


105
00:10:30.334 --> 00:10:33.704
I mean, I have expensive taste but
I don't believe in wasting money.


106
00:10:35.072 --> 00:10:40.477
- So, it's 17.85?
- Oh, I will even... even 18. I'm not heartless.


107
00:10:40.511 --> 00:10:41.812
Clearly.

108
00:10:43.881 --> 00:10:46.016
So, what do you want to do now?

109
00:10:47.184 --> 00:10:48.986
Ah, we go for a ride.

110
00:10:49.019 --> 00:10:51.488
- We'll pull over, have a bottle of wine.
- Yeah.


111
00:10:53.490 --> 00:10:55.326
Let's go.

112
00:11:22.319 --> 00:11:24.888
<i>Getting money out
of Paul was becoming annoying.</i>


113
00:11:24.922 --> 00:11:27.992
<i>I don't know if he was having
financial problems but it was clear.</i>


114
00:11:28.025 --> 00:11:30.427
<i>I am so over this relationship.</i>

115
00:11:30.461 --> 00:11:33.130
So, what do you think?

116
00:11:33.163 --> 00:11:39.069
Yeah, the screen is so much bigger and
the camera totally kicks ass. So worth it.


117
00:11:39.103 --> 00:11:42.439
Well, how about we put this away
for a while


118
00:11:42.473 --> 00:11:46.977
and we can talk about how you're
gonna show me your appreciation.


119
00:11:47.011 --> 00:11:48.779
<i>Yep, I'm done.</i>

120
00:12:09.634 --> 00:12:11.935
You know what, this wine
is going right through me.


121
00:12:12.637 --> 00:12:15.439
- Let me go to the bathroom real fast. I'll be right back.
- Hurry back.


122
00:12:16.874 --> 00:12:18.208
- One moment.
- Okay.


123
00:12:18.242 --> 00:12:19.243
Be right back.

124
00:12:23.314 --> 00:12:26.016
Hey, do we have any more wine?

125
00:12:26.984 --> 00:12:28.319
Yeah, I have...
I have some wine in the truck.


126
00:12:28.352 --> 00:12:29.420
I'll get it.
Just give me one second.


127
00:13:10.662 --> 00:13:12.996
What in the holy fuck?

128
00:13:13.030 --> 00:13:14.431
I wish you hadn't had done that.

129
00:13:14.465 --> 00:13:16.233
Jesus, Ted, you scared me.

130
00:13:16.266 --> 00:13:17.401
Obviously.

131
00:13:18.670 --> 00:13:20.938
What is all this?

132
00:13:20.971 --> 00:13:23.240
It was supposed to be a surprise
but you ruined it.


133
00:13:24.475 --> 00:13:27.144
- Ted, that's not funny.
- I'm not laughing.


134
00:13:28.646 --> 00:13:31.081
Stay away from me,
you fucking psycho.


135
00:13:31.115 --> 00:13:32.983
Oh, you got spirit. I like that.

136
00:13:33.016 --> 00:13:35.052
Most girls just curl up
into a little ball.


137
00:13:35.085 --> 00:13:37.254
It's gonna be a lot of fun.

138
00:13:37.287 --> 00:13:41.191
- Stay away from me, you ass, or I'll fucking kill you.
- Give it a shot.


139
00:13:41.225 --> 00:13:42.660
You fucking...

140
00:13:46.363 --> 00:13:50.934
We both knew this time was coming.
This run is over.


141
00:13:52.704 --> 00:13:54.606
Now, it's my turn for some fun.

142
00:14:04.448 --> 00:14:07.384
Help! No! Fuck!

143
00:14:32.744 --> 00:14:34.044
Oh!

144
00:14:35.078 --> 00:14:37.682
Don't make me come
on that huge cock of yours.


145
00:14:50.394 --> 00:14:52.730
Oh, crazy, babe.

146
00:14:55.733 --> 00:14:57.702
You want to go again?

147
00:14:57.735 --> 00:15:02.206
Uh, yeah, just, uh...
just give me a few minutes, okay?


148
00:15:02.239 --> 00:15:04.341
Okay.

149
00:15:04.374 --> 00:15:08.345
- How about I go get us some wine and you try and get it up?
- Perfect.


150
00:15:13.618 --> 00:15:18.155
<i>Paul is really nice.
I sort of hated to see things end.</i>


151
00:15:19.356 --> 00:15:21.325
<i>Inorganic mercury.</i>

152
00:15:21.358 --> 00:15:23.628
<i>It's used to make batteries
and is deadly when ingested.</i>


153
00:15:23.661 --> 00:15:26.698
<i>It's cheap and super easy
to get your hands on.</i>


154
00:15:45.850 --> 00:15:49.119
<i>I was watching
a true crime story on A&E.</i>


155
00:15:49.152 --> 00:15:53.190
<i>One of the stories was about a woman who
killed her boyfriend for the insurance money.</i>


156
00:15:53.223 --> 00:15:57.629
<i>I didn't even know you could take out an insurance
policy on someone you weren't married to.</i>


157
00:15:57.662 --> 00:16:00.063
<i>That was a game changer.</i>

158
00:16:11.542 --> 00:16:14.511
<i>Believe it or not,
I was gonna miss Lisa.</i>


159
00:16:14.545 --> 00:16:19.283
<i>But I found the best thing to do after a relationship
like this is to get right back out there.</i>


160
00:16:24.121 --> 00:16:28.492
<i>Technology also makes it incredibly
easy to take on different identities</i>


161
00:16:28.525 --> 00:16:30.595
<i>which comes in very handy
at times.</i>


162
00:16:38.502 --> 00:16:40.404
<i>I just heard about this new app.</i>

163
00:16:40.437 --> 00:16:43.307
<i>The girls on here
are supposed to be insanely hot.</i>


164
00:16:44.576 --> 00:16:48.780
<i>Hello, who do we have here?
You look like fun.</i>


165
00:16:58.590 --> 00:17:00.090
<i>This guy is hot.</i>

166
00:17:01.859 --> 00:17:05.128
<i>If you're gonna have to fuck a guy
for a while, it's definitely a plus.</i>


167
00:17:18.275 --> 00:17:19.677
- Hi, guys, welcome.
- Hey.


168
00:17:27.317 --> 00:17:29.621
- Did you find everything okay?
- I did, thank you.


169
00:17:29.654 --> 00:17:30.888
Oh, this is so cute.

170
00:17:30.922 --> 00:17:32.824
- Isn't it so cute?
- Yeah.


171
00:17:32.857 --> 00:17:34.826
I'm going to Coachella,
so I thought it would be perfect.


172
00:17:34.859 --> 00:17:36.594
Oh, that's gonna...
This is gonna be great for Coachella.


173
00:17:36.628 --> 00:17:40.197
- Have you been before?
- I have, yeah. It's so much fun.


174
00:17:40.230 --> 00:17:42.900
- This is my first time, so I'm really excited.
- Oh, you'll have a blast.


175
00:17:42.934 --> 00:17:45.235
So, 35.82 is your total.

176
00:17:48.205 --> 00:17:50.842
So how do you meet these guys
anyway?


177
00:17:50.875 --> 00:17:53.276
It's the digital age,
how do you think?


178
00:17:54.344 --> 00:17:56.546
You mean, like Craigslist?

179
00:17:56.581 --> 00:17:59.316
Because you know
people get killed on there.


180
00:17:59.349 --> 00:18:01.686
Oh, don't be silly, Annie.

181
00:18:04.756 --> 00:18:06.791
- All right, have so much fun.
- Thank you so much.


182
00:18:06.824 --> 00:18:08.191
- Bye.
- Bye.


183
00:18:14.231 --> 00:18:16.566
That's so cute.
Do you want to try it on?


184
00:18:16.601 --> 00:18:17.935
Um...

185
00:18:17.969 --> 00:18:20.571
You know,
it might be a little too short.


186
00:18:20.605 --> 00:18:23.206
You know, you always want
to leave the guys wanting more.


187
00:18:23.240 --> 00:18:25.242
It's a good point.
I hadn't thought of that.


188
00:18:26.243 --> 00:18:28.713
So what, like, Tinder?

189
00:18:28.746 --> 00:18:30.782
Yeah, something like that.

190
00:18:30.815 --> 00:18:32.817
It's a little more exclusive and
tailored towards wealthy men.


191
00:18:33.951 --> 00:18:35.586
Yes, I love that.

192
00:18:35.620 --> 00:18:36.954
- Do you want to try it on?
- Yeah.


193
00:18:36.988 --> 00:18:38.355
Perfect. Right this way.

194
00:18:48.231 --> 00:18:52.904
So, wait, you don't actually have sex
for money with these guys, do you?


195
00:18:52.937 --> 00:18:58.408
Annie, we all have sex for money and the guys
have to provide if they want us to provide.


196
00:19:05.850 --> 00:19:09.020
I just think you should
value yourself a little more.


197
00:19:09.053 --> 00:19:10.888
That's all I'm saying.

198
00:19:11.856 --> 00:19:16.761
Excuse me, sweetie,
can I ask you how much you make a month?


199
00:19:16.794 --> 00:19:20.665
Oh, um, I don't know,
it just depends on commission.


200
00:19:22.767 --> 00:19:27.471
The first year, I made 50,000 and that
was going on two or three dates a week.


201
00:19:27.504 --> 00:19:30.675
And this year, I wouldn't be surprised
if I cleared a hundred thousand.


202
00:19:30.708 --> 00:19:32.542
And the guys aren't that ugly.

203
00:19:35.512 --> 00:19:36.446
- Here you go.
- Thank you.


204
00:19:36.480 --> 00:19:37.414
Mm
-Hm.

205
00:19:40.651 --> 00:19:42.754
Aren't you worried about what
people are gonna think of you?


206
00:19:42.787 --> 00:19:44.722
- Excuse me.
- Yeah.


207
00:19:44.756 --> 00:19:46.724
What did you say
the name of that app was?


208
00:19:46.758 --> 00:19:48.793
- It's <i>Ballers and Babes</i>.
- Thanks.


209
00:19:55.066 --> 00:19:57.735
<i>First,
you really have to vet them.</i>


210
00:19:57.769 --> 00:20:00.838
<i>Of course, this guy's going to try and
impress you with how much money he has.</i>


211
00:20:00.872 --> 00:20:03.406
<i>So, it's really important to see
if that's real.</i>


212
00:20:04.108 --> 00:20:07.078
<i>Also, it's not just about
how much money he has</i>


213
00:20:07.111 --> 00:20:09.513
<i>but how much he is willing
to spend on you.</i>


214
00:20:12.750 --> 00:20:17.021
So, Ted, I'm surprised that you
managed to stay single for so long.


215
00:20:17.054 --> 00:20:20.557
It's, obviously, not because
you can't find someone.


216
00:20:20.591 --> 00:20:26.798
Well, I've had my fair share of women
but, uh, it just never seems to last.


217
00:20:27.732 --> 00:20:29.299
What usually goes wrong?

218
00:20:30.735 --> 00:20:32.435
I don't know.

219
00:20:32.469 --> 00:20:33.771
I mean, for example,
I just got out of a relationship


220
00:20:35.273 --> 00:20:39.911
and, uh, we had a good run but, uh,
things... things had run its course.


221
00:20:40.912 --> 00:20:42.479
It's hard to explain.
You just get something,


222
00:20:42.512 --> 00:20:43.948
you get...
kind of get a feeling for it.


223
00:20:47.618 --> 00:20:49.954
I went through
something similar myself.


224
00:20:53.090 --> 00:20:53.825
They must really want to talk to
you, they keep calling.


225
00:20:55.525 --> 00:21:00.564
- I'm so sorry.
- That's okay. You can take it.


226
00:21:00.598 --> 00:21:01.732
- Really?
- Yeah.


227
00:21:01.766 --> 00:21:04.501
Okay. Hello.

228
00:21:07.537 --> 00:21:09.506
Can you excuse me for a second?

229
00:21:17.715 --> 00:21:20.383
Yeah, how can I help you,
Detective?


230
00:21:20.417 --> 00:21:22.552
I'm afraid I have some bad news.

231
00:21:23.688 --> 00:21:25.690
<i>You knew Mr. 
Paul Sandberg?</i>

232
00:21:26.791 --> 00:21:29.359
Uh, yeah, of course.
Him and I were dating.


233
00:21:30.460 --> 00:21:34.098
I'm sorry to tell you this but, uh,
Mr. Sandberg was found dead in his house


234
00:21:34.131 --> 00:21:35.498
a few hours ago.

235
00:21:36.533 --> 00:21:39.003
Oh, my God! Uh, what happened?

236
00:21:39.036 --> 00:21:40.470
<i>Well, we're not sure yet.</i>

237
00:21:40.503 --> 00:21:42.807
I think it might be
a heart attack.


238
00:21:49.512 --> 00:21:51.481
- Hi.
- Hey, can I get you anything else right now?


239
00:21:51.514 --> 00:21:53.017
- No, I'm okay.
- You sure?


240
00:21:53.050 --> 00:21:54.619
- Yeah.
- All right, great.


241
00:21:54.652 --> 00:21:56.419
Hey, what happened to your foot
by the way?


242
00:21:56.453 --> 00:22:00.758
Oh, I, uh, I got into a...
a rock climbing accident.


243
00:22:00.791 --> 00:22:02.827
So, you rock climb?

244
00:22:02.860 --> 00:22:04.729
- I... I did, yeah.
- Not anymore, huh?


245
00:22:04.762 --> 00:22:06.429
Not anymore. Not for the moment.

246
00:22:06.463 --> 00:22:08.099
Nice. You gotta be
pretty strong for that, huh?


247
00:22:08.132 --> 00:22:09.600
Yeah. Do you climb?

248
00:22:09.634 --> 00:22:11.602
No, I've always been interested
though.


249
00:22:11.636 --> 00:22:13.004
- Yeah?
- Yeah.


250
00:22:13.037 --> 00:22:15.505
Me and one of the cooks,
we, uh, we... we climb.


251
00:22:15.538 --> 00:22:19.577
I'd love to... to... maybe you'd
like to come with us one day.


252
00:22:19.610 --> 00:22:21.646
- Your boyfriend?
- No, he's not.


253
00:22:21.679 --> 00:22:23.948
I'm... I'm single.
He's just a friend.


254
00:22:23.981 --> 00:22:26.183
Nice. Nice. I'm just
on a first date over here.


255
00:22:26.217 --> 00:22:28.551
- Ah, first dates.
- Yes.


256
00:22:28.586 --> 00:22:31.622
- I was wondering.
- Yes. You know, nice girl.


257
00:22:31.656 --> 00:22:34.926
- How's it going?
- She's very nice. Very nice person.


258
00:22:34.959 --> 00:22:36.861
- Yeah.
- Sounds like it's going well.


259
00:22:36.894 --> 00:22:38.129
- Yeah.
- Good.


260
00:22:38.162 --> 00:22:41.564
- I'm, uh, I'm Ted.
- I'm Caitlin.


261
00:22:41.599 --> 00:22:43.768
- Caitlin. Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.


262
00:22:43.801 --> 00:22:46.203
We'll go rock climbing sometime when
you're on the... on the mend here.


263
00:22:46.237 --> 00:22:48.072
That sounds like fun.

264
00:22:48.105 --> 00:22:49.941
- I'll... I'll be right back.
- Okay.


265
00:22:50.975 --> 00:22:53.144
Uh, would you be willing
to meet up with me?


266
00:22:53.177 --> 00:22:56.546
I need to ask you a few questions.
Just routine stuff.


267
00:22:58.983 --> 00:23:01.484
Yeah, yeah, of course.

268
00:23:01.518 --> 00:23:04.454
Um, I'm... I'm busy tonight, but I can
come by first thing tomorrow morning.


269
00:23:05.790 --> 00:23:08.225
Oh, yeah, that'd be great.
Thank you.


270
00:23:18.235 --> 00:23:20.972
- Hi. Everything okay?
- Yeah.


271
00:23:21.005 --> 00:23:24.875
It was my landlord and, um,
there's a leak in the apartment above me.


272
00:23:24.909 --> 00:23:26.010
So, it's fine.

273
00:23:27.778 --> 00:23:30.014
So, where are you taking me
tonight?


274
00:23:30.047 --> 00:23:32.583
There is this underground
speakeasy downtown.


275
00:23:32.616 --> 00:23:36.053
- We got some jazz. Sound good?
- Perfect.


276
00:23:38.122 --> 00:23:39.156
All right.

277
00:23:41.759 --> 00:23:43.894
So, you guys ready
for some dessert?


278
00:23:43.928 --> 00:23:47.231
We have an amazing
peach cobbler. It's homemade.


279
00:23:47.264 --> 00:23:49.900
Is it gluten-free?

280
00:23:49.934 --> 00:23:52.303
It's peach cobbler.

281
00:23:52.336 --> 00:23:55.006
- We'll just take the check.
- Great.


282
00:23:55.039 --> 00:23:56.140
- There you go.
- Thank you.


283
00:23:56.173 --> 00:23:57.174
Have a nice day.

284
00:24:13.024 --> 00:24:15.693
A heart attack? I mean...

285
00:24:15.726 --> 00:24:18.329
I shouldn't be surprised
he did eat like shit.


286
00:24:18.362 --> 00:24:22.600
No, it wasn't his diet, suicide.

287
00:24:24.235 --> 00:24:25.636
He left a note.

288
00:24:28.939 --> 00:24:30.107
It was written to you.

289
00:24:31.375 --> 00:24:34.211
Really? What does it say?

290
00:24:37.948 --> 00:24:41.685
"Dear Kimberly,
by the time you read this


291
00:24:41.719 --> 00:24:44.688
I will have already crossed over
the other side.


292
00:24:45.756 --> 00:24:49.660
I'm sorry to leave you in this
dark cruel world without me.


293
00:24:49.693 --> 00:24:52.596
But just know that you made it
a better place for me.


294
00:24:54.031 --> 00:24:58.803
I love you and I hope you find
happiness like I found with you.


295
00:24:58.836 --> 00:25:01.906
Love eternally, Paul."

296
00:25:04.408 --> 00:25:06.844
Forensics confirmed
it's his handwriting.


297
00:25:07.978 --> 00:25:11.315
As you can probably imagine,
his wife didn't take it very well.


298
00:25:11.348 --> 00:25:15.619
My God! Poor Paul.

299
00:25:40.678 --> 00:25:43.047
It's been a while
since you've been in.


300
00:25:43.080 --> 00:25:46.217
Yeah, I'm... I'm sorry
about that, I got really busy.


301
00:25:47.852 --> 00:25:49.320
Well, I understand.

302
00:25:49.353 --> 00:25:55.960
Um, last time you were in
was, um, August 6th.


303
00:25:58.095 --> 00:26:00.297
How's the Xanax working for you?

304
00:26:01.699 --> 00:26:04.768
Yeah, I didn't actually take it.

305
00:26:05.936 --> 00:26:07.037
Why is that?

306
00:26:08.672 --> 00:26:13.944
Well, I was reading online about some of
the side effects and I had some concerns.


307
00:26:13.978 --> 00:26:15.813
Like... what?

308
00:26:18.382 --> 00:26:21.685
Well, it says it causes
confusion and memory loss


309
00:26:21.719 --> 00:26:26.123
and there was this woman online who said she
called her mom and forgot about it the next day.


310
00:26:28.125 --> 00:26:31.362
Do me a favor,
stay off the internet.


311
00:26:32.296 --> 00:26:36.834
If you have any questions,
call me. Get right back to you.


312
00:26:38.869 --> 00:26:42.173
I think that we can
make progress by... by talking


313
00:26:42.206 --> 00:26:48.078
and you letting me know your
feelings about the situation.


314
00:26:52.416 --> 00:26:56.420
You mean, this stuff
with my mom's ex-boyfriend


315
00:26:56.453 --> 00:27:01.091
'cause I don't really want
to talk about that. It was...


316
00:27:01.992 --> 00:27:03.794
- Yeah.
- ...a long time ago.


317
00:27:03.827 --> 00:27:06.730
I know, I know. I understand.

318
00:27:06.764 --> 00:27:12.770
And, um, it's...
it's never easy to talk about.


319
00:27:14.305 --> 00:27:20.444
But, uh, you know,
if we don't talk about it


320
00:27:22.513 --> 00:27:28.018
and you don't start dealing with
it, it's never going to go away.


321
00:27:28.052 --> 00:27:30.387
And this is probably
where your...


322
00:27:30.421 --> 00:27:35.292
A lot of this anxiety, a lot of these problems
that you've talked to me about having


323
00:27:35.326 --> 00:27:37.061
is stemming from.

324
00:27:37.094 --> 00:27:38.862
And I think, the more
that you can talk about it,


325
00:27:40.231 --> 00:27:44.435
and this is... this does not leave
this room, this is me and you,


326
00:27:44.468 --> 00:27:49.473
and the more that you can talk about
it, the easier it'll be for you.


327
00:27:57.314 --> 00:28:01.819
Imagine that the one person

328
00:28:01.852 --> 00:28:05.155
that's supposed to protect you,

329
00:28:07.825 --> 00:28:09.827
she doesn't even believe you.

330
00:28:13.831 --> 00:28:18.068
So, that every time you said no,

331
00:28:20.504 --> 00:28:22.806
he made it that much worse.

332
00:28:26.043 --> 00:28:29.179
Would you want
to think about that?


333
00:28:30.514 --> 00:28:34.285
No. No.

334
00:28:37.121 --> 00:28:43.827
But I have spoken to a lot of
young girls who have dealt with it


335
00:28:43.861 --> 00:28:50.868
and the best thing I can suggest is
for you to start talking about it.


336
00:28:50.901 --> 00:28:57.408
So, if you can talk to me about
it, the way it made you feel,


337
00:28:59.476 --> 00:29:01.378
I think it can make you better.

338
00:29:01.412 --> 00:29:03.380
I think I can help you.
I really do.


339
00:29:07.619 --> 00:29:11.121
Maybe I'll try the Xanax
another time.


340
00:29:11.155 --> 00:29:12.590
Okay. All right.

341
00:29:22.366 --> 00:29:25.469
<i>Fred is a guy I found to
help me with the financial arrangements.</i>


342
00:29:25.502 --> 00:29:29.540
<i>He has some great connections that are morally
pliable and don't ask too many questions.</i>


343
00:29:29.574 --> 00:29:33.143
<i>I give him a third of the cut
and I let him have sex with me.</i>


344
00:29:33.177 --> 00:29:36.380
<i>I know. But it was the only way
he would agree to it.</i>


345
00:29:36.413 --> 00:29:41.852
Two hundred and fifty thousand minus
eighty-two thousand five hundred for me.


346
00:29:43.387 --> 00:29:46.223
I gotta say,
we make a pretty good team.


347
00:29:46.256 --> 00:29:49.326
Team? What do you mean by team?

348
00:29:49.360 --> 00:29:53.297
I just mean we work well
together and I look out for you.


349
00:29:54.699 --> 00:29:56.567
- You look out for me?
- Yeah.


350
00:29:58.969 --> 00:30:03.240
Yeah, we do make a good team
but this is just business.


351
00:30:03.273 --> 00:30:04.241
I know.

352
00:30:05.476 --> 00:30:10.080
Okay, good because I don't need
you falling in love with me.


353
00:30:10.114 --> 00:30:11.181
I'm not.

354
00:30:13.250 --> 00:30:15.152
But, you know,
would that be so bad?


355
00:30:16.053 --> 00:30:19.523
Fred, we've been over this.
This is business.


356
00:30:19.556 --> 00:30:22.359
I know. I'm... I'm just saying,
hypothetically,


357
00:30:22.393 --> 00:30:26.063
if something were to happen
between us.


358
00:30:26.096 --> 00:30:27.898
Would that be such a bad thing?

359
00:30:28.600 --> 00:30:30.067
You're married.

360
00:30:31.468 --> 00:30:36.440
And you kill guys for money, so,
you know, let's not be judgmental.


361
00:30:36.473 --> 00:30:38.576
Okay, let's just drop it.

362
00:30:38.610 --> 00:30:41.278
Okay, you're my business partner
and you get to fuck me,


363
00:30:41.311 --> 00:30:44.381
- so that's as good as it gets, okay?
- Whatever.


364
00:30:45.583 --> 00:30:48.018
So, what's this new guy like?

365
00:30:50.320 --> 00:30:55.392
He's okay. I mean, he is kind of a loner
and good-looking and he fucks me good.


366
00:30:56.493 --> 00:30:59.363
What's that supposed to mean,
he fucks you good?


367
00:30:59.396 --> 00:31:02.466
It means he has a
cock and knows how to use it.


368
00:31:05.436 --> 00:31:07.672
Is he better than me?

369
00:31:10.140 --> 00:31:12.042
You don't want me
to answer that, do you?


370
00:31:13.645 --> 00:31:16.313
So, hey, how's your guy coming
with the new policy?


371
00:31:18.015 --> 00:31:21.653
So, what's it like doing it?
Is it hard?


372
00:31:23.420 --> 00:31:25.389
- Killing the guys?
- Yeah.


373
00:31:26.724 --> 00:31:32.162
Yeah, the first one
was hard but it gets easier.


374
00:31:32.196 --> 00:31:35.399
Key is not to let it get
too easy so I don't get sloppy.


375
00:31:37.802 --> 00:31:40.070
Hey, I got a question.

376
00:31:40.103 --> 00:31:44.408
How in the hell did you get that
last guy to write a suicide note?


377
00:31:44.441 --> 00:31:46.778
That was fucking brilliant.

378
00:31:51.315 --> 00:31:54.485
You know, Dr. Harris told me
something very interesting today.


379
00:31:54.518 --> 00:31:56.153
Yeah? What's that?

380
00:31:57.889 --> 00:32:01.358
Well, he told me about this exercise he has
people do in his couple therapy session.


381
00:32:01.391 --> 00:32:03.494
Mm
-Hm. What kind of exercise?

382
00:32:03.527 --> 00:32:06.598
He has them write letters
to each other.


383
00:32:06.631 --> 00:32:10.033
Um, yeah,
my first wife and I did that.


384
00:32:10.067 --> 00:32:11.535
It did not work out.

385
00:32:11.568 --> 00:32:14.606
No, but Dr. Harris
has an interesting twist.


386
00:32:14.639 --> 00:32:17.742
He has them imagine that
they've died and gone to heaven.


387
00:32:17.775 --> 00:32:20.812
- You believe in heaven?
- Paul, that's not the point.


388
00:32:20.845 --> 00:32:23.447
Okay, okay, fine. Go on.

389
00:32:23.480 --> 00:32:27.284
So you imagine that you're in heaven and
you have one last chance to write a letter


390
00:32:27.317 --> 00:32:29.319
to the one person you loved.

391
00:32:29.353 --> 00:32:32.657
- Isn't that romantic?
- Yeah, if you say so.


392
00:32:32.690 --> 00:32:34.558
It sounds a little didactic
for my taste.


393
00:32:35.459 --> 00:32:37.494
Okay, whatever,
I didn't mean to be didactic.


394
00:32:37.528 --> 00:32:40.765
What? I'm just saying
it's not for me. That's all.


395
00:32:40.798 --> 00:32:43.400
Okay, well,
I should sleep in my own bed tonight.


396
00:32:43.433 --> 00:32:47.037
Wait, wait,
okay, okay, let's do it.


397
00:32:49.106 --> 00:32:51.441
- What?
- Let's do it. Let's write the letters.


398
00:32:51.475 --> 00:32:53.443
No,
you're just saying like that.


399
00:32:53.477 --> 00:32:57.381
No, it... it sounded weird at
first but I... It could be fun.


400
00:32:57.414 --> 00:33:00.484
Really?
You would do that for me?


401
00:33:00.517 --> 00:33:02.754
Of course, I'd do that for you.

402
00:33:02.787 --> 00:33:05.122
Here, I'll go get the pen
and paper.


403
00:33:10.862 --> 00:33:12.095
Done.

404
00:33:16.333 --> 00:33:19.236
"Dear, Kimberly,
by the time you read this


405
00:33:19.269 --> 00:33:21.673
I will have already crossed over
the other side.


406
00:33:23.675 --> 00:33:27.679
See, everything out of context
sounds exactly like a suicide note


407
00:33:27.712 --> 00:33:31.515
- and he didn't suspect a thing.
- Jesus.


408
00:33:32.650 --> 00:33:35.152
Remind me never to get
on your bad side.


409
00:33:35.185 --> 00:33:39.556
Well, just keep these checks
coming and you'll be fine.


410
00:33:39.591 --> 00:33:40.625
Fair enough.

411
00:33:42.526 --> 00:33:46.463
- Wanna go fuck?
- Ugh, do we have to?


412
00:33:47.732 --> 00:33:50.167
You don't have to sound
so excited.


413
00:33:50.200 --> 00:33:51.769
Well, do you want to do it
or not?


414
00:33:51.803 --> 00:33:53.337
Yeah, no, let's go.

415
00:34:06.718 --> 00:34:08.518
So, you know
how you're gonna do this guy?


416
00:34:09.954 --> 00:34:13.256
Um, well,
I'm still figuring it out.


417
00:34:14.391 --> 00:34:18.896
You know, I'm learning about a lot of
interesting non-traceable lethal chemicals.


418
00:34:18.930 --> 00:34:21.365
You know, I think I have a knack
for this sort of thing.


419
00:34:22.700 --> 00:34:25.670
If I had applied myself, I would
have done much better in chemistry.


420
00:34:27.437 --> 00:34:30.675
Well, you're applying yourself now.
It's all that matters.


421
00:34:31.576 --> 00:34:33.745
That's true. Thanks, Fred.

422
00:34:35.412 --> 00:34:40.350
Just don't be an idiot and do any
research on your home computer.


423
00:34:40.384 --> 00:34:44.321
Well, if the Casey Anthony thing
taught us anything it was that.


424
00:34:46.390 --> 00:34:48.358
Yeah, I always use a cheap tablet,
free Wi-Fi at a coffee shop


425
00:34:48.392 --> 00:34:50.662
- and then toss it.
- Good girl.


426
00:34:52.396 --> 00:34:56.934
Yeah, so, uh, I still have 30 minutes
before I gotta go. You want to go again?


427
00:34:58.335 --> 00:35:00.672
Um...

428
00:35:00.705 --> 00:35:03.240
Sweetie, if you want more sex than you're
getting, we're gonna have to discuss.


429
00:35:03.273 --> 00:35:05.342
You getting a lower percentage
of your cut.


430
00:35:06.778 --> 00:35:08.545
You can't blame a guy
for trying.


431
00:35:15.385 --> 00:35:16.854
- There you are.
- Hi.


432
00:35:16.888 --> 00:35:17.955
How you doing?

433
00:35:19.791 --> 00:35:20.825
Wow.

434
00:35:23.828 --> 00:35:25.863
- Good to see you.
- You, too. You look stunning.


435
00:35:25.897 --> 00:35:28.265
- What, thanks.
- Very welcome.


436
00:35:28.298 --> 00:35:30.567
- You look good, too.
- Well, thank you.


437
00:35:44.281 --> 00:35:48.385
I don't know, is it just me or
is this place a little creepy?


438
00:35:48.418 --> 00:35:49.453
I don't think so.

439
00:35:50.722 --> 00:35:53.591
Besides, you're here with me.
What could possibly go wrong?


440
00:35:53.624 --> 00:35:55.993
That's true.

441
00:35:56.027 --> 00:35:58.696
- Do you... do you like the wine?
- Yeah, I like it.


442
00:35:58.730 --> 00:36:01.465
Really? It's a little tannic
for my taste.


443
00:36:01.498 --> 00:36:03.968
But I have a great Pinot.
You wanna try it?


444
00:36:04.001 --> 00:36:05.737
- Sure.
- Here.


445
00:36:22.385 --> 00:36:23.688
It's getting chilly out here.

446
00:36:24.589 --> 00:36:26.624
- You cold?
- Yeah.


447
00:36:28.325 --> 00:36:30.360
Let's just have a little
more wine then we'll go back.


448
00:36:50.413 --> 00:36:53.618
- How you doing tonight, Ma'am?
- Good.


449
00:36:55.352 --> 00:36:58.388
- Are we not supposed to be here?
- No, you're fine.


450
00:36:58.421 --> 00:37:00.524
Just, uh, you might want
to keep an eye out.


451
00:37:00.557 --> 00:37:02.492
There was a murder here
a couple of weeks ago.


452
00:37:04.829 --> 00:37:07.330
Is everything okay, Sir?

453
00:37:07.364 --> 00:37:09.801
Yes, I was just telling the miss here that
we had a murder a couple of weeks ago.


454
00:37:09.834 --> 00:37:12.069
Yeah, I heard about that.
That was right here?


455
00:37:12.103 --> 00:37:15.606
Yep, the police suspect we're
dealing with a serial killer.


456
00:37:16.874 --> 00:37:21.012
They tend to always return to
the same place for more victims.


457
00:37:21.045 --> 00:37:24.347
You said we.
Are you involved in the investigation?


458
00:37:24.381 --> 00:37:29.020
Well, not technically,
but this is my territory,


459
00:37:29.053 --> 00:37:33.825
so I'm doing my part to keep the
police informed, warn the public.


460
00:37:33.858 --> 00:37:36.127
- That sort of thing.
- I see.


461
00:37:36.160 --> 00:37:39.096
Well, thanks for giving us the heads
up and, uh, good luck with your case.


462
00:37:41.666 --> 00:37:43.533
See, I told you
this place was creepy?


463
00:37:45.036 --> 00:37:47.738
You got great instincts. You were right.
Come on, let's get out of here.


464
00:37:47.772 --> 00:37:49.874
Well, you folks
have a good evening.


465
00:37:49.907 --> 00:37:53.110
You too, Sir. Thank you.
Come on.


466
00:38:01.085 --> 00:38:02.385
Bye.

467
00:38:17.835 --> 00:38:20.037
Goddamn fucking cryptids!

468
00:38:26.543 --> 00:38:30.014
Fucking hooker,
whore, slut fucking bitch!


469
00:38:36.087 --> 00:38:37.655
What do we have here?

470
00:38:44.695 --> 00:38:47.497
Excuse me, I don't mean to bother
you but I'm a little lost here.


471
00:38:47.530 --> 00:38:49.000
Uh, sure, where are you going?

472
00:38:49.033 --> 00:38:51.202
Well, my client's having a party
around here


473
00:38:51.235 --> 00:38:53.137
but the guy's not picking up the
phone and I can't find the address.


474
00:38:53.170 --> 00:38:55.940
- What street does he live on?
- Let's see.


475
00:38:55.973 --> 00:38:58.943
I think it's, um, Dickens.

476
00:38:58.976 --> 00:39:00.645
That's on the other side
of Ventura.


477
00:39:02.013 --> 00:39:03.581
Of course. This guy wouldn't live
on the north side of Ventura.


478
00:39:05.116 --> 00:39:07.852
What are you,
like a lawyer or something?


479
00:39:07.885 --> 00:39:11.055
Worse actually. I'm a talent agent.
I represent actors.


480
00:39:11.088 --> 00:39:12.555
Really?

481
00:39:12.590 --> 00:39:14.058
Yeah, this guy's TV show
got picked up.


482
00:39:14.091 --> 00:39:16.160
He's having a little party
to celebrate.


483
00:39:16.193 --> 00:39:18.729
I really hate going
to these things


484
00:39:18.763 --> 00:39:20.698
but it would be bad for him if I didn't
show up since I'm taking ten percent.


485
00:39:20.731 --> 00:39:22.199
Right.

486
00:39:22.233 --> 00:39:25.236
- Well, thank you for your help.
- Yeah, no problem.


487
00:39:25.269 --> 00:39:27.838
All right. Hey, I don't mean
to sound, uh, too forward


488
00:39:27.872 --> 00:39:31.876
but you wouldn't want to come hang with a
bunch of superficial TV people, would you?


489
00:39:31.909 --> 00:39:34.211
That actually sounds really fun.

490
00:39:34.245 --> 00:39:36.047
Great.

491
00:39:44.155 --> 00:39:45.589
Hi. I'm Seth.

492
00:39:45.623 --> 00:39:47.058
Hi. I'm Nancy. 
Nice to meet you.

493
00:39:47.091 --> 00:39:48.893
Nice to meet you, Nancy.
And what do you do?


494
00:39:48.926 --> 00:39:52.529
Uh, you're not gonna believe
this, but I am an actress.


495
00:39:52.562 --> 00:39:55.166
- Get out of here. What a coincidence.
- Yeah.


496
00:39:55.199 --> 00:39:58.069
- Do you have an agent?
- Uh, no, actually not yet.


497
00:39:58.102 --> 00:40:00.037
How about, uh, a reel?
You have a reel?


498
00:40:00.071 --> 00:40:02.606
Yeah, I just, uh,
finished a short film.


499
00:40:02.640 --> 00:40:04.875
- Fantastic. I'd love to see it.
- Really?


500
00:40:04.909 --> 00:40:07.845
- Yeah, you have a great look.
- Thank you.


501
00:40:07.878 --> 00:40:09.914
You're welcome.
I've good eye for these things.


502
00:40:59.063 --> 00:41:00.798
It's the fourth one this month.

503
00:41:03.134 --> 00:41:04.668
It's the worst one yet.

504
00:41:09.740 --> 00:41:13.210
- Hey, Kimberly, did you hear?
- Hear what, Janet?


505
00:41:13.244 --> 00:41:18.983
Nancy, the actress, that lives
across the way, she was murdered.


506
00:41:19.016 --> 00:41:20.684
Wait, when, what happened?

507
00:41:20.718 --> 00:41:23.354
They found her body
up by Topanga Canyon.


508
00:41:23.387 --> 00:41:25.289
They think
it was a serial killer.


509
00:41:26.223 --> 00:41:28.726
I was just up there.

510
00:41:28.759 --> 00:41:30.895
Oh, no.

511
00:41:30.928 --> 00:41:33.330
Yeah, the ranger came by and said that
they found another girl's body there.


512
00:41:33.364 --> 00:41:38.335
Oh, my God! I don't know
what this world is coming to.


513
00:41:38.369 --> 00:41:41.338
People are so heartless.

514
00:41:42.306 --> 00:41:45.009
- I have to go, Janet.
- Oh.


515
00:41:45.910 --> 00:41:48.112
- I'll... I'll call you later?
- Okay.


516
00:41:53.050 --> 00:41:55.186
I like the new signature.

517
00:41:55.219 --> 00:41:59.857
And somehow you manage to keep
them all looking differently.


518
00:41:59.890 --> 00:42:01.659
It's all about the details.

519
00:42:02.426 --> 00:42:09.733
Speaking of details, so does he
really fuck better than I do?


520
00:42:09.767 --> 00:42:12.036
Jesus, Fred, obsessed much?

521
00:42:13.070 --> 00:42:15.339
Well, does he?

522
00:42:17.408 --> 00:42:20.010
He's got 20 years of experience.

523
00:42:20.044 --> 00:42:22.012
But don't worry, it gives you
something to work towards


524
00:42:22.046 --> 00:42:25.916
and there's really not much you
can do about that cock thing.


525
00:42:25.950 --> 00:42:30.054
That's cold.

526
00:42:30.087 --> 00:42:31.122
You asked.

527
00:42:39.396 --> 00:42:41.665
Can you believe it,
we were just up there?


528
00:42:42.399 --> 00:42:43.901
Yeah, that is eerie.

529
00:42:43.934 --> 00:42:46.971
And that girl,
she lives so close to me.


530
00:42:47.004 --> 00:42:48.973
I hope they catch
this son of a bitch.


531
00:42:49.006 --> 00:42:50.808
It's fucking scary.

532
00:42:51.842 --> 00:42:54.311
Listen, I gotta run but, uh,
I'll see you later, right?


533
00:42:54.345 --> 00:42:56.947
- <i>Yeah, okay.</i>
- Okay, bye.


534
00:43:00.985 --> 00:43:02.653
<i>Damn it,
that was too impulsive.</i>


535
00:43:04.388 --> 00:43:07.324
<i>What was I fucking thinking picking
up a random girl off the street,</i>


536
00:43:07.358 --> 00:43:09.426
<i>especially
in Kimberly's neighborhood?</i>


537
00:43:10.961 --> 00:43:13.764
<i>I'm gonna have to find
a new spot for next time.</i>


538
00:43:19.003 --> 00:43:21.205
And it happened
right in my neighborhood,


539
00:43:21.238 --> 00:43:25.009
it's... I get so freaked out
at any little noise I hear,


540
00:43:25.042 --> 00:43:26.410
I feel like someone's
breaking in.


541
00:43:26.443 --> 00:43:29.013
I don't think you have anything
to worry about.


542
00:43:29.046 --> 00:43:32.082
I mean, it seems like this guy's luring them
in secluded areas and then killing them,


543
00:43:32.116 --> 00:43:34.451
he's not breaking into homes,
okay?


544
00:43:36.020 --> 00:43:39.390
If it makes you feel any better,
you can stay here with me tonight.


545
00:43:41.492 --> 00:43:42.760
Thanks, Ted.

546
00:43:43.994 --> 00:43:47.331
- I do feel safer here.
- Good.


547
00:44:08.786 --> 00:44:10.487
Oh, fuck.

548
00:44:12.523 --> 00:44:15.226
Uh, that was amazing.

549
00:44:16.560 --> 00:44:18.796
You should teach guys
how to fuck.


550
00:44:18.829 --> 00:44:21.031
You could charge a fortune.

551
00:44:21.065 --> 00:44:23.167
Thank you.

552
00:44:24.101 --> 00:44:25.502
You're good, too.

553
00:44:27.238 --> 00:44:28.272
Fuck.

554
00:44:32.409 --> 00:44:33.877
Well, you smoke?

555
00:44:35.079 --> 00:44:38.315
Why? Does it bother you?
I don't have to.


556
00:44:39.850 --> 00:44:42.553
Oh, fuck.
My doctor says I should quit.


557
00:44:42.587 --> 00:44:44.188
That's good advice.

558
00:44:44.221 --> 00:44:46.023
Yeah, I had some problems
with my liver.


559
00:44:46.056 --> 00:44:47.524
I was drinking
a bottle of scotch a night.


560
00:44:48.492 --> 00:44:50.261
But since I quit it went away.

561
00:44:50.294 --> 00:44:52.830
Just have a couple of glasses
of wine at night now.


562
00:44:52.863 --> 00:44:54.898
So, you're like an alcoholic?

563
00:44:54.932 --> 00:44:59.370
No, I was just bored.

564
00:45:02.172 --> 00:45:03.540
Now, I've got some new hobbies.

565
00:45:04.842 --> 00:45:08.012
- Like fucking young girls.
- For example.


566
00:45:09.346 --> 00:45:11.982
Well, I'm glad
I could keep you healthy.


567
00:45:12.016 --> 00:45:13.450
Me, too.

568
00:45:53.591 --> 00:45:56.193
<i>There is a breed
of mushrooms that when cooked,</i>


569
00:45:56.226 --> 00:45:59.096
<i>they look and taste
like regular mushrooms.</i>


570
00:45:59.129 --> 00:46:02.199
<i>These, however,
are highly toxic.</i>


571
00:46:02.232 --> 00:46:04.868
<i>As little as one ounce
is enough to kill someone.</i>


572
00:46:17.448 --> 00:46:18.982
- Eat up.
- This is great.


573
00:46:37.167 --> 00:46:39.503
Mmm. Delicious.

574
00:46:40.705 --> 00:46:43.073
- Good.
- I'm impressed.


575
00:46:49.213 --> 00:46:50.280
Oh, God!

576
00:46:58.723 --> 00:47:00.124
Oh, my God!

577
00:47:08.265 --> 00:47:10.000
<i>911, state your emergency.</i>

578
00:47:10.033 --> 00:47:12.369
I... I need an ambulance
right away, please.


579
00:47:17.541 --> 00:47:20.578
So, how you been doing?

580
00:47:21.579 --> 00:47:22.614
Good.

581
00:47:23.648 --> 00:47:26.183
Yeah, this week
was a little tough


582
00:47:26.216 --> 00:47:31.188
but I was seeing this guy
and we went out a few times.


583
00:47:33.725 --> 00:47:35.159
And how was that?

584
00:47:36.393 --> 00:47:42.366
It was really great,
but I sort of put an end to things.


585
00:47:42.399 --> 00:47:43.701
Why?

586
00:47:45.502 --> 00:47:48.573
I don't know. I didn't want it
to get too complicated.


587
00:47:50.073 --> 00:47:52.042
Considering
what you've been through,


588
00:47:52.075 --> 00:47:55.546
you're probably afraid of letting
a man get too close to you.


589
00:47:57.181 --> 00:48:00.951
Maybe. I never thought
about it like that.


590
00:48:02.252 --> 00:48:04.121
Might be worth the risk.

591
00:48:05.657 --> 00:48:07.692
Well, I'll keep that in mind
for the future


592
00:48:07.725 --> 00:48:11.028
but pretty sure
this relationship was over.


593
00:48:12.362 --> 00:48:16.200
You never know. Sometimes these
things aren't as final as you think.


594
00:48:17.367 --> 00:48:21.004
Mm... Yeah, that's true.

595
00:48:22.539 --> 00:48:25.476
- But not this one. Yeah.
- All right.


596
00:48:30.615 --> 00:48:34.351
I don't understand.
How did he pull through?


597
00:48:34.384 --> 00:48:36.553
I told you,
he's like freakishly healthy.


598
00:48:36.588 --> 00:48:38.623
This is gonna be a lot harder
than I thought.


599
00:48:40.357 --> 00:48:43.227
- Or maybe...
- What?


600
00:48:45.062 --> 00:48:47.097
Maybe you're starting
to have feelings for this guy.


601
00:48:48.733 --> 00:48:50.702
Yeah, I like Ted.

602
00:48:50.735 --> 00:48:54.538
I also liked Paul.
But I still acted like a professional.


603
00:48:54.572 --> 00:48:56.273
I don't know.

604
00:48:56.306 --> 00:48:58.075
I think it's different
with this guy.


605
00:48:59.343 --> 00:49:01.278
What are you talking about?

606
00:49:01.311 --> 00:49:05.115
Well, you're always talking
about how good he is in bed


607
00:49:05.148 --> 00:49:09.219
and how hot he is and how
he takes care of himself.


608
00:49:10.254 --> 00:49:12.757
Are you jealous, Fred?

609
00:49:12.790 --> 00:49:15.225
No. No.

610
00:49:16.594 --> 00:49:23.066
I just think, maybe subconsciously,
you didn't want to kill him.


611
00:49:23.100 --> 00:49:25.637
Let's get something straight
right now.


612
00:49:25.670 --> 00:49:30.675
I don't really want to kill anyone, okay?
And I don't really enjoy it.


613
00:49:30.708 --> 00:49:32.577
But that doesn't mean
that I'm not going to do it.


614
00:49:32.610 --> 00:49:36.748
Yeah, I like Ted,
but business is business.


615
00:49:36.781 --> 00:49:43.387
You're right, I... I'm sorry, I didn't
mean to question your professionalism.


616
00:49:44.288 --> 00:49:46.791
I'm just trying to make sure
your head's still in the game.


617
00:49:46.824 --> 00:49:48.860
Yeah, don't worry
where my head is at.


618
00:49:48.893 --> 00:49:51.428
You take care of things on your
end and I'll take care of the rest.


619
00:49:52.563 --> 00:49:55.465
- I'm sorry.
- I think you should go.


620
00:49:56.901 --> 00:49:58.603
I... I said I'm sorry.

621
00:50:00.103 --> 00:50:04.374
I'm the one taking all the risk here, okay?
I don't need you questioning me.


622
00:50:05.409 --> 00:50:07.679
You're right. I apologize.

623
00:50:10.648 --> 00:50:13.851
- I was thinking, uh, maybe we could...
- No.


624
00:50:13.885 --> 00:50:17.789
Okay, I have a date with Ted later
and I want to be well-rested.


625
00:50:18.923 --> 00:50:24.261
- Well-rested up for your epic sex?
- Exactly.


626
00:50:28.833 --> 00:50:30.868
It's really cool.

627
00:50:30.902 --> 00:50:33.638
- Yeah, it's really nice of you.
- You have a great laugh.


628
00:50:33.671 --> 00:50:34.872
No.

629
00:50:34.906 --> 00:50:36.641
- It's true. It's true.
- Stop.


630
00:50:36.674 --> 00:50:38.576
- How you two doing?
- Good, my friend.


631
00:50:38.610 --> 00:50:39.877
- Would you like some wine?
- Yeah.


632
00:50:39.911 --> 00:50:42.212
- And you, Sir?
- Yes, please. Thank you.


633
00:50:45.415 --> 00:50:48.886
You know, I was thinking... maybe we can
get out of town this weekend, you know?


634
00:50:49.854 --> 00:50:53.523
It sounds nice.
What did you have in mind?


635
00:50:53.557 --> 00:50:58.562
Yeah. Maybe we'd go to like a small
town somewhere, something secluded,


636
00:50:58.596 --> 00:51:00.530
I don't know, like a log cabin.

637
00:51:00.564 --> 00:51:02.432
It sounds cozy.

638
00:51:02.466 --> 00:51:04.501
My friend has a place
a few hours up north.


639
00:51:04.534 --> 00:51:07.270
We leave on Friday,
maybe get brunch on Saturday,


640
00:51:07.304 --> 00:51:09.339
bring a bottle of wine,
go for a hike.


641
00:51:10.608 --> 00:51:12.710
- I am in.
- Great.


642
00:51:14.344 --> 00:51:19.751
Oh, I have a therapy session at 3 PM,
um, maybe we can leave after that.


643
00:51:19.784 --> 00:51:23.253
That works.
By the way, how's that going?


644
00:51:23.955 --> 00:51:27.959
Well, it's going good.
I think I'm having some breakthroughs.


645
00:51:27.992 --> 00:51:31.729
Really?
What kind of breakthroughs?


646
00:51:31.763 --> 00:51:37.702
Well, Dr. Harris seems to think that these kind
of relationships are leaving me feeling numb.


647
00:51:39.236 --> 00:51:40.872
Hmm. What do you think?

648
00:51:43.440 --> 00:51:50.414
I think that the idea of having something
stable and more long term has its appeal.


649
00:51:50.447 --> 00:51:51.649
What about you?

650
00:51:52.984 --> 00:51:55.953
Oh, I mean, yeah,
that would... sounds nice.


651
00:51:57.554 --> 00:52:04.394
I just, uh, I have some...
I have some things in my personal life


652
00:52:04.428 --> 00:52:09.701
that I don't think would go over too
well on a long-term relationship.


653
00:52:09.734 --> 00:52:11.334
Like what?

654
00:52:14.672 --> 00:52:17.374
Just some hobbies that I have.

655
00:52:18.542 --> 00:52:20.778
What could you possibly do
in your spare time


656
00:52:20.812 --> 00:52:24.882
that would interfere with
a relationship like forever?


657
00:52:24.916 --> 00:52:26.550
No. No.

658
00:52:28.385 --> 00:52:33.256
I'll tell you what,
I could show you this weekend.


659
00:52:34.458 --> 00:52:37.862
It sounds adventurous.
I'm intrigued.


660
00:52:38.996 --> 00:52:40.430
You have no idea.

661
00:52:48.840 --> 00:52:51.743
I don't know,
it just sounds too risky.


662
00:52:51.776 --> 00:52:54.444
Why? Don't you trust me?

663
00:52:54.478 --> 00:52:59.449
Yes, I trust you, but involving another
person, it just complicates things.


664
00:52:59.483 --> 00:53:00.852
And why do you want
to be involved now?


665
00:53:00.885 --> 00:53:03.353
You never wanted
to be involved before.


666
00:53:03.386 --> 00:53:07.524
Well, I'm just thinking he...
he already survived one poison attempt.


667
00:53:08.425 --> 00:53:12.029
If he's poisoned again,
it could look very suspicious.


668
00:53:12.063 --> 00:53:15.432
Yeah, but you're talking about
a botched robbery.


669
00:53:15.465 --> 00:53:18.936
I mean, have you ever shot
someone or fired a gun?


670
00:53:20.337 --> 00:53:24.341
I've never killed anyone
but I know I could do it.


671
00:53:25.442 --> 00:53:27.645
And, yes, I fired a gun.

672
00:53:27.678 --> 00:53:30.681
My dad used to take me to the
shooting range every Sunday.


673
00:53:30.715 --> 00:53:32.382
I'm a pretty good shot.

674
00:53:33.818 --> 00:53:38.055
Okay, shooting someone is a lot
different than shooting at a target.


675
00:53:39.090 --> 00:53:42.392
Look, I'm telling you,
I could do it.


676
00:53:44.561 --> 00:53:46.563
Okay. How would it go down?

677
00:53:48.465 --> 00:53:52.469
There's a mini mart on the way to the
cabin, the bathroom's in the back.


678
00:53:53.470 --> 00:53:55.940
You just tell him
that you need to take a leak.


679
00:53:55.973 --> 00:53:57.975
And when you go into
the bathroom, you just wait.


680
00:53:59.076 --> 00:54:02.113
After a few minutes,
call him on his cell phone


681
00:54:02.146 --> 00:54:04.081
and tell him that there's no
toilet paper in the bathroom,


682
00:54:04.115 --> 00:54:06.617
that you need him
to bring you some.


683
00:54:06.651 --> 00:54:09.787
When he steps around the corner,
I'll be waiting there.


684
00:54:10.922 --> 00:54:13.490
I'll put two in his head
and one in his chest.


685
00:54:13.523 --> 00:54:16.627
It just sounds too risky.

686
00:54:17.862 --> 00:54:20.064
I... I've already done
some recon.


687
00:54:20.097 --> 00:54:24.101
There are no cameras back there and
hardly anyone ever goes to this place.


688
00:54:24.135 --> 00:54:28.538
All you have to do is make sure
no one's around when you call him


689
00:54:28.573 --> 00:54:32.076
and then just give me some time to make
it to the freeway and we're home free.


690
00:54:34.078 --> 00:54:36.013
You really think
you could do it?


691
00:54:36.047 --> 00:54:40.585
- You think you could pull the trigger?
- I know I could.


692
00:54:48.960 --> 00:54:51.629
You okay?
You seem a little quiet.


693
00:54:52.830 --> 00:54:54.531
Yeah, I'm fine.

694
00:54:54.564 --> 00:54:57.467
Uh, so how far away
is this place?


695
00:54:57.500 --> 00:55:00.037
Uh, it's like two and a half hours,
maybe a little bit more with traffic.


696
00:55:00.071 --> 00:55:02.740
If... if you're tired,
take a nap, seat goes back.


697
00:55:02.773 --> 00:55:04.441
Okay.

698
00:55:04.474 --> 00:55:05.910
You sure you don't want
anything to drink?


699
00:55:05.943 --> 00:55:08.579
- Mm-Hm, I'm good.
- Okay. I'll be right back.


700
00:55:08.613 --> 00:55:10.413
Lock the doors.

701
00:55:23.560 --> 00:55:25.196
Hey, Fred, it's me.

702
00:55:25.229 --> 00:55:27.899
Um, yeah, we have to... we have
to call the whole thing off.


703
00:55:27.932 --> 00:55:30.601
<i>I have a really bad feeling
about this.</i>


704
00:55:30.635 --> 00:55:34.805
Goddamn it, Kimberly.
Everything is already in place.


705
00:55:34.839 --> 00:55:38.075
No, trust me,
it's not gonna happen.


706
00:55:38.109 --> 00:55:40.111
I knew you were
falling in love with him.


707
00:55:40.144 --> 00:55:41.746
I'll call you later.

708
00:55:48.185 --> 00:55:49.787
Fucking asshole.

709
00:55:50.821 --> 00:55:53.024
I can't wait to kill your ass.

710
00:56:05.535 --> 00:56:07.905
- Did I scare you?
- Yeah.


711
00:56:07.939 --> 00:56:09.607
Oh.

712
00:56:09.640 --> 00:56:12.043
- Whoa.
- I told you to lock the door. Here.


713
00:56:12.977 --> 00:56:15.046
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.


714
00:56:15.079 --> 00:56:16.847
Don't say
I never got you anything.


715
00:56:16.881 --> 00:56:20.151
It's okay, well, you know what,
I am kind of hungry, so.


716
00:56:20.184 --> 00:56:21.886
Okay, I'll feed you.

717
00:56:21.919 --> 00:56:25.990
- What are you in the mood for?
- Anything. Sushi?


718
00:56:26.023 --> 00:56:27.625
- You like sushi?
- Yeah.


719
00:56:27.658 --> 00:56:29.727
Okay, good, it's a good
sushi place on the way.


720
00:56:29.760 --> 00:56:31.729
Okay.

721
00:56:31.762 --> 00:56:35.666
Right after my dad left,
my mom lost her job


722
00:56:35.700 --> 00:56:39.536
and then she had to go on
unemployment and then food stamps.


723
00:56:39.569 --> 00:56:41.238
It was just so embarrassing.

724
00:56:43.007 --> 00:56:47.979
Then my mom would sell them for really cheap
so she could buy booze and cigarettes.


725
00:56:48.913 --> 00:56:51.882
You can't buy that stuff
with food stamps.


726
00:56:51.916 --> 00:56:55.186
- Makes sense why you're so ambitious.
- Yeah.


727
00:56:56.320 --> 00:57:01.859
Uh, I remember standing in line in the grocery
store and my mama will whip out the food stamps.


728
00:57:01.892 --> 00:57:03.995
I just felt like
everyone was staring at us.


729
00:57:05.596 --> 00:57:10.001
From that point on, I swore that I
would never be a loser like that.


730
00:57:11.736 --> 00:57:14.071
You're the farthest thing
from a loser.


731
00:57:16.107 --> 00:57:18.609
I'm just happy
we were getting away.


732
00:57:18.642 --> 00:57:21.012
Me, too.
I'm glad you wanted to come.


733
00:57:37.962 --> 00:57:39.096
Is this it?

734
00:57:40.464 --> 00:57:42.933
Yeah, I know, it doesn't look
like much but it's on the inside.


735
00:57:44.001 --> 00:57:46.137
It looks kind of scary.

736
00:57:46.170 --> 00:57:50.975
Yeah, let me get the lights on,
you'll warm up too, I promise.


737
00:58:14.331 --> 00:58:16.600
Hey, how did you sleep?

738
00:58:18.002 --> 00:58:20.337
Uh, surprisingly well.

739
00:58:20.371 --> 00:58:24.141
It's really quiet here, right?
There's nobody around for miles.


740
00:58:25.676 --> 00:58:28.012
Now, you want to head into town
and get some breakfast?


741
00:58:28.045 --> 00:58:33.751
Hmm, yeah, I just have
to hop in the shower.


742
00:58:35.953 --> 00:58:39.190
- You want to join me?
- Definitely.


743
00:58:48.732 --> 00:58:54.905
You know, this isn't a place I normally come,
but I gotta say it's kind of charming.


744
00:58:54.939 --> 00:58:57.007
Good. I'm glad you like it.

745
00:58:57.908 --> 00:58:59.877
We've got some fun things
planned for us.


746
00:58:59.910 --> 00:59:02.346
Ooh. Intriguing.

747
00:59:02.379 --> 00:59:04.982
How are you guys doing?
Can I get you anything else?


748
00:59:05.015 --> 00:59:08.953
- Oh, we're good. Just the check, please.
- Okay, be right back.


749
00:59:08.986 --> 00:59:11.322
Hey, you know, is there a
hardware store around here?


750
00:59:11.355 --> 00:59:14.792
Oh, yeah, right up the street
like three-quarters of a block up


751
00:59:14.825 --> 00:59:19.697
you take a right, it's called Johnson's,
run by Bobby and his son Earl Jr.


752
00:59:19.730 --> 00:59:22.233
Thank you.

753
00:59:22.266 --> 00:59:25.836
I gotta grab a couple of things for
the house. Shouldn't be too long.


754
00:59:25.870 --> 00:59:27.371
You mind waiting here
for a minute?


755
00:59:27.404 --> 00:59:28.672
Yeah, that's fine.

756
00:59:28.706 --> 00:59:30.708
Beautiful. Don't go anywhere.

757
01:00:00.237 --> 01:00:04.375
What the fuck are you doing here?
Are you trying to sabotage this?


758
01:00:04.408 --> 01:00:06.877
- I need to talk to you.
- No, you don't.


759
01:00:06.911 --> 01:00:10.314
I told you it was off and I'll
call you when I get back to L.A.


760
01:00:10.347 --> 01:00:11.315
So, you're not gonna do it?

761
01:00:13.417 --> 01:00:17.054
I am going to do it.
I just need more time.


762
01:00:17.087 --> 01:00:19.290
I don't think that's it.

763
01:00:20.391 --> 01:00:23.260
I... I think there's
something else going on here.


764
01:00:23.294 --> 01:00:26.964
Fred,
I'm only gonna say this once.


765
01:00:26.997 --> 01:00:29.099
Back the fuck off!

766
01:00:29.133 --> 01:00:31.335
This is my business
and you work for me.


767
01:00:33.037 --> 01:00:36.407
I don't think you fully
appreciate what I contribute.


768
01:00:36.440 --> 01:00:39.009
Okay, you wouldn't even
have a business without me.


769
01:00:39.043 --> 01:00:42.413
Okay, you're not the only person
that sells life insurance.


770
01:00:43.514 --> 01:00:45.749
Are you threatening
to cut me out?


771
01:00:45.783 --> 01:00:48.452
Because that would be
a very bad idea.


772
01:00:48.485 --> 01:00:50.921
I'm not threatening you.

773
01:00:50.955 --> 01:00:53.257
I'm just merely pointing out the fact
that compared to what I have to do,


774
01:00:53.290 --> 01:00:55.492
your job is very easy.

775
01:00:55.526 --> 01:01:00.231
Hey, I'm offering to be more involved,
to share more of the risk here.


776
01:01:00.264 --> 01:01:02.766
I appreciate that,
but I work alone.


777
01:01:04.868 --> 01:01:06.070
You're in love with him,
aren't you?


778
01:01:07.004 --> 01:01:07.972
Fred.

779
01:01:09.073 --> 01:01:11.275
Look, it's okay if you are.
Just, you know, tell me.


780
01:01:11.308 --> 01:01:13.377
Be... be straight about it.

781
01:01:13.410 --> 01:01:16.080
And if you want to call it off,
we can.


782
01:01:16.113 --> 01:01:17.948
Just don't jerk me around.

783
01:01:17.982 --> 01:01:22.052
I'm not in love with anyone.
I'm going to do it.


784
01:01:23.921 --> 01:01:26.290
Okay. If you say so.

785
01:01:26.323 --> 01:01:28.058
Yeah, I say so.

786
01:01:29.226 --> 01:01:32.463
Now, you need to leave
before Ted comes back.


787
01:01:32.496 --> 01:01:33.864
I'm only trying to help.

788
01:01:35.332 --> 01:01:38.369
You can help by going home.

789
01:01:40.237 --> 01:01:41.205
Fine.

790
01:01:43.040 --> 01:01:44.908
If you need me, 
I'll be around.

791
01:01:44.942 --> 01:01:48.779
No, don't be around, Fred.
Go home.


792
01:02:03.927 --> 01:02:07.097
Hello. Anyone here?

793
01:02:07.131 --> 01:02:08.932
- Hey, how you doing, Sir?
- Nice to see you, my friend.


794
01:02:08.966 --> 01:02:10.467
- How you doing?
- Excellent. What can we do for you?


795
01:02:10.501 --> 01:02:12.436
So, I'm having a little issue
back at the house, uh,


796
01:02:12.469 --> 01:02:14.471
a dead deer is entangled
in my fence there.


797
01:02:14.505 --> 01:02:16.574
You have anything that
could possibly cut through it?


798
01:02:16.608 --> 01:02:18.942
- Yeah, bone you say, huh?
- That's the worst.


799
01:02:18.976 --> 01:02:22.346
That's tough. Uh, ax saw,
that'll do the trick.


800
01:02:22.379 --> 01:02:24.415
- Perfect.
- Yeah, I got a bunch of them in the back.


801
01:02:24.448 --> 01:02:26.584
Oh, great, great. Do you have
anything for any clogged pipes?


802
01:02:26.618 --> 01:02:28.285
Oh, yeah,
I mean, I got a Liquid-Plumr.


803
01:02:28.319 --> 01:02:29.953
You need something stronger
than that?


804
01:02:29.987 --> 01:02:32.122
You know what,
it's really, really backed up.


805
01:02:32.156 --> 01:02:34.425
You happen to have anything with
some hydrochloric acid by any chance?


806
01:02:34.458 --> 01:02:36.960
I might, I'm not sure,
but we can go check in the back.


807
01:02:36.994 --> 01:02:40.264
- Okay, cool.
- Right this way, Sir. Hey, watch your step.


808
01:02:46.036 --> 01:02:50.407
Hi, Dr. Harris.
Um, I'm sorry to bother you on the weekend.


809
01:02:50.441 --> 01:02:53.510
It's no problem, Kimberly.
What's going on?


810
01:02:54.478 --> 01:03:01.185
I'm just having some really bad
anxiety border-lining on panic.


811
01:03:01.218 --> 01:03:03.621
Go on. And?

812
01:03:03.655 --> 01:03:08.525
I'm just having some really weird feelings
and I just don't know what's going on.


813
01:03:09.993 --> 01:03:11.962
What kind of feelings?

814
01:03:13.464 --> 01:03:15.933
Feelings for a person.

815
01:03:17.101 --> 01:03:18.636
Okay, I'm listening.

816
01:03:20.237 --> 01:03:23.140
I mean, on one hand, I'm really happy
with the way the relationship is going


817
01:03:23.173 --> 01:03:25.442
and on the other,
I'm really conflicted.


818
01:03:26.343 --> 01:03:30.214
And that makes you uneasy?

819
01:03:30.247 --> 01:03:36.253
Yeah, like... like, I'm losing myself
and I can't get my emotions under control


820
01:03:36.286 --> 01:03:40.190
and I just... I don't know
what's wrong with me.


821
01:03:40.224 --> 01:03:43.560
Nothing is wrong with you,
Kimberly.


822
01:03:45.295 --> 01:03:47.665
Sounds to me
like you are in love.


823
01:03:47.699 --> 01:03:50.501
What? I am?

824
01:03:51.402 --> 01:03:54.004
Yeah, I'm pretty sure.

825
01:03:54.037 --> 01:03:57.241
Oh, well, that...
that's not good.


826
01:03:57.274 --> 01:03:58.942
<i>Why not?</i>

827
01:03:58.976 --> 01:04:01.145
Well, it really screws up
my plans.


828
01:04:01.178 --> 01:04:06.316
Welcome to being in love.
You just gotta go for it.


829
01:04:07.719 --> 01:04:12.523
Uh, I don't know, Dr. Harris, I... I really
don't think I am ready for that sort of thing.


830
01:04:12.556 --> 01:04:15.058
<i>This is a
breakthrough for you, Kimberly.</i>


831
01:04:15.092 --> 01:04:17.161
Give it a chance.

832
01:04:17.194 --> 01:04:18.295
Okay.

833
01:04:19.396 --> 01:04:21.532
Uh, thank you. I... I gotta go.

834
01:04:30.507 --> 01:04:34.077
<i>I felt things with Kimberly had
gone as far as they were gonna go,</i>


835
01:04:34.111 --> 01:04:36.648
<i>so I planned
some fun farewell games.</i>


836
01:04:36.681 --> 01:04:38.515
<i>Well, fun for me anyway.</i>

837
01:04:40.150 --> 01:04:43.655
<i>But then something caught me
completely off guard.</i>


838
01:04:46.791 --> 01:04:52.697
Ted, there's something
I... I have to tell you.


839
01:04:54.064 --> 01:04:57.134
And this is a first for me,
so keep that in mind.


840
01:04:58.469 --> 01:04:59.671
What is it?

841
01:05:01.573 --> 01:05:04.007
I'm just gonna be really honest
with you.


842
01:05:04.041 --> 01:05:06.744
Okay, now I'm scared.

843
01:05:07.812 --> 01:05:09.313
You should be.

844
01:05:12.584 --> 01:05:17.020
When we first started dating, I was
only interested in you for your money.


845
01:05:18.222 --> 01:05:21.191
Oh, we met on a sugar daddy app.
It's not a newsflash.


846
01:05:22.559 --> 01:05:23.761
Yeah.

847
01:05:25.529 --> 01:05:29.299
I just... I've just been
through a lot of guys


848
01:05:29.333 --> 01:05:34.104
and with you it's...

849
01:05:35.439 --> 01:05:36.741
It's different with me?

850
01:05:39.209 --> 01:05:40.244
Yeah.

851
01:05:41.411 --> 01:05:46.550
I...
This isn't supposed to happen.


852
01:05:49.086 --> 01:05:50.220
What is it?

853
01:05:51.789 --> 01:05:57.160
I don't know, it's... your eyes
or that you're really hot


854
01:05:57.194 --> 01:06:00.163
or you're really good in bed

855
01:06:03.166 --> 01:06:05.135
or that you're really smart

856
01:06:08.372 --> 01:06:11.108
and you make me laugh.

857
01:06:18.115 --> 01:06:19.516
I am falling for you.

858
01:06:25.790 --> 01:06:27.592
You don't seem too happy
about that.


859
01:06:30.260 --> 01:06:31.428
I'm not.

860
01:06:35.465 --> 01:06:40.504
But maybe... maybe it's you.

861
01:06:42.640 --> 01:06:46.076
- It's my fault?
- Yeah.


862
01:06:49.581 --> 01:06:51.548
I don't really believe in love.

863
01:06:54.251 --> 01:06:58.188
But maybe we're like soul mates.

864
01:07:02.292 --> 01:07:05.529
I just had to get that
off my chest.


865
01:07:07.865 --> 01:07:09.433
I'm glad you told me.

866
01:07:11.468 --> 01:07:12.870
Okay.

867
01:07:12.904 --> 01:07:15.172
What is it that you wanted
to show me?


868
01:07:15.907 --> 01:07:21.144
Oh, you know what not today.
Maybe tomorrow.


869
01:07:21.178 --> 01:07:23.380
What? You're gonna make me wait
for that?


870
01:07:23.413 --> 01:07:25.148
You'll be glad I did. Come here.

871
01:07:36.894 --> 01:07:39.797
- Hey, are you getting hungry?
- Yeah, I could eat actually.


872
01:07:40.765 --> 01:07:43.567
Well, the place across
the street looks pretty good.


873
01:07:43.601 --> 01:07:45.402
Oh, this place is good.
You want to go there?


874
01:07:46.671 --> 01:07:47.905
Yeah.

875
01:07:47.939 --> 01:07:49.506
I'm gonna go in the shop
real quick.


876
01:07:49.539 --> 01:07:51.241
Do you want to get us a table?

877
01:07:51.274 --> 01:07:53.611
- Sounds good.
- Okay.


878
01:07:53.645 --> 01:07:56.246
- Thanks, Ted.
- You're welcome. Take the umbrella.


879
01:07:56.279 --> 01:07:57.915
- I'll be right over here.
- Okay.


880
01:08:03.420 --> 01:08:06.289
<i>That was the second time
I saw that guy hanging around.</i>


881
01:08:06.323 --> 01:08:08.558
<i>First, I thought he might have
just been checking Kimberly out,</i>


882
01:08:08.593 --> 01:08:10.828
<i>but then I thought
it might be something more.</i>


883
01:08:10.862 --> 01:08:13.865
<i>When I saw him the second time,
I knew for sure he definitely knew her,</i>


884
01:08:13.898 --> 01:08:15.900
<i>probably her boyfriend.</i>

885
01:08:15.933 --> 01:08:18.568
<i>Not that I really give a fuck.</i>

886
01:08:18.603 --> 01:08:21.338
<i>I can't believe I actually sort of
believed Kimberly's bullshit earlier.</i>


887
01:08:22.406 --> 01:08:25.275
I got it. A gas leak.

888
01:08:25.308 --> 01:08:27.377
What the fuck
are you doing here?


889
01:08:27.411 --> 01:08:29.947
I followed you guys up to
the cabin you're staying at.


890
01:08:29.981 --> 01:08:34.484
And after you guys went on your little picnic,
I picked the lock and I checked the place out.


891
01:08:34.518 --> 01:08:37.421
That old stove
would work perfectly.


892
01:08:37.454 --> 01:08:40.792
What the fuck are you doing?
Stalking us? Come on.


893
01:08:46.698 --> 01:08:49.266
Just... just listen to me, okay.

894
01:08:49.299 --> 01:08:54.471
All you have to do is just wait till Ted's
asleep and then just turn one of those knobs,


895
01:08:54.504 --> 01:08:57.240
a quarter turn to the right and
then just tiptoe out of there.


896
01:08:57.274 --> 01:08:59.409
I'll have my car
parked up the street always.


897
01:08:59.443 --> 01:09:01.545
He'll be dead by morning.

898
01:09:01.579 --> 01:09:04.247
Okay, what if he gets up,
sees I'm not there and smells the gas?


899
01:09:04.281 --> 01:09:05.917
What then, genius?

900
01:09:05.950 --> 01:09:07.685
Okay, okay.

901
01:09:07.719 --> 01:09:12.556
Well, uh,
I... I still have the gun.


902
01:09:12.590 --> 01:09:15.927
I could just wait inside the cabin and
pop him when you walk through the door.


903
01:09:15.960 --> 01:09:18.830
Fred, I swear to God.

904
01:09:18.863 --> 01:09:20.965
I knew you were falling in love
with him.


905
01:09:20.998 --> 01:09:23.000
I'm getting really fucking sick
of this, okay.


906
01:09:23.034 --> 01:09:25.737
You... you have to leave.

907
01:09:25.770 --> 01:09:29.272
Just... just tell me you're not
in love with him and I'll leave.


908
01:09:29.306 --> 01:09:32.275
- Why?
- Because I'm in love with you.


909
01:09:33.310 --> 01:09:34.979
I want to be with you.

910
01:09:35.012 --> 01:09:37.849
Jesus Christ, Fred.
I really can't deal with this now.


911
01:09:37.882 --> 01:09:39.884
Ted is waiting for me.
I have to leave.


912
01:09:39.917 --> 01:09:41.686
Okay, fine.

913
01:09:43.353 --> 01:09:47.324
I'm staying at the Pine Tree and if... if
you need anything, if you change your mind.


914
01:09:48.760 --> 01:09:50.628
Go home.

915
01:09:53.530 --> 01:09:54.866
I'll leave my cell on.

916
01:10:05.042 --> 01:10:07.011
So, we're pretty beat.

917
01:10:07.044 --> 01:10:09.847
- You want to head to bed?
- Yeah.


918
01:10:09.881 --> 01:10:12.950
Um, give me a minute.
I have something I want to put on for you.


919
01:10:13.918 --> 01:10:14.986
Beautiful.

920
01:10:23.928 --> 01:10:25.328
Don't be too long.

921
01:11:28.793 --> 01:11:31.394
<i>There was definitely
something going on here.</i>


922
01:11:31.428 --> 01:11:33.430
<i>I don't know what game
these two are playing</i>


923
01:11:33.463 --> 01:11:36.133
<i>but I had some games of my own
that I was looking forward to.</i>


924
01:12:31.022 --> 01:12:32.857
Did you sleep good?

925
01:12:33.758 --> 01:12:36.961
Look, I... I don't know
what Fred told you


926
01:12:36.994 --> 01:12:40.932
but I... I told him
not to go through with it.


927
01:12:40.965 --> 01:12:42.465
What are you talking about?

928
01:12:46.270 --> 01:12:51.609
Fred, he was... he was gonna try and kill
you but I... I called the whole thing off.


929
01:12:53.044 --> 01:12:55.579
- He was gonna kill me?
- Yeah.


930
01:12:55.613 --> 01:13:00.685
At the gas station, he's gonna shoot you but
I told him to not go through with the plan.


931
01:13:02.620 --> 01:13:03.688
What plan?

932
01:13:07.524 --> 01:13:08.926
What plan?

933
01:13:11.929 --> 01:13:14.899
Fred, he sells life insurance

934
01:13:14.932 --> 01:13:19.070
and he takes out policies
on the guys.


935
01:13:20.004 --> 01:13:21.572
It was really easy.

936
01:13:21.605 --> 01:13:26.277
And I just... I kept doing it
and I'm sorry.


937
01:13:33.050 --> 01:13:34.517
You kill guys for money.

938
01:13:40.691 --> 01:13:42.059
And you were going to kill me.

939
01:13:43.227 --> 01:13:45.229
Yeah. But I...

940
01:13:48.833 --> 01:13:51.902
I meant what I said
the other night.


941
01:13:59.710 --> 01:14:06.017
You are a fucking filthy vile
whore piece of fucking trash.


942
01:14:06.050 --> 01:14:08.886
I am gonna rid the world
of all of you.


943
01:14:08.919 --> 01:14:11.689
I am here to do the
devil's work, do you understand?


944
01:14:13.624 --> 01:14:16.927
Please, please don't do this.
You don't have to. Please.


945
01:14:16.961 --> 01:14:21.265
I remember begging like that
when I was five years old


946
01:14:22.333 --> 01:14:25.036
and I begged my father
not to kill my dog.


947
01:14:25.069 --> 01:14:29.173
And you know what he did,
he slit his throat.


948
01:14:33.878 --> 01:14:37.815
Oh, yeah, I should have fucking killed
you quick like the rest of them.


949
01:14:40.851 --> 01:14:42.720
There was just something
about you.


950
01:14:43.921 --> 01:14:46.090
You're the serial killer?

951
01:14:47.024 --> 01:14:49.860
I'm surprised it took you
this long to figure it out.


952
01:14:52.229 --> 01:14:55.099
You killed my neighbor
that night you dropped me off?


953
01:14:55.132 --> 01:14:59.070
That was supposed to be you.
That park ranger interrupted.


954
01:15:04.041 --> 01:15:06.744
I was falling in love with you,

955
01:15:06.777 --> 01:15:10.948
and to think I was feeling
guilty for trying to poison you.


956
01:15:10.981 --> 01:15:12.049
Poison me?

957
01:15:14.418 --> 01:15:18.322
That night with the spaghetti
and the mushrooms.


958
01:15:21.859 --> 01:15:23.160
That was you?

959
01:15:25.129 --> 01:15:26.163
Yeah.

960
01:15:27.198 --> 01:15:28.265
Bullshit.

961
01:15:31.902 --> 01:15:33.370
You have your juice
this morning?


962
01:15:36.907 --> 01:15:38.142
You're bluffing.

963
01:15:40.744 --> 01:15:42.279
And if you're fucking
lying to me,


964
01:15:45.349 --> 01:15:50.387
I'm gonna cut your tongue out and then I'm
going to cut from here all the way to here,


965
01:15:51.989 --> 01:15:53.891
and then I'm going to cut
this eye out.


966
01:15:55.926 --> 01:15:58.362
And then, I'm going to slit your
throat until you fucking die


967
01:15:58.395 --> 01:16:00.297
while you watch me
with this eye.


968
01:16:03.100 --> 01:16:04.768
So, let's go get the antidote.

969
01:16:14.912 --> 01:16:16.113
How are you feeling?

970
01:16:18.449 --> 01:16:21.719
Still a little queasy
but better.


971
01:16:26.824 --> 01:16:28.092
I'm really sorry.

972
01:16:33.464 --> 01:16:34.899
I'm sorry for scaring you.

973
01:16:39.837 --> 01:16:41.238
You must think I'm a monster.

974
01:16:45.776 --> 01:16:47.077
No, I... I don't.

975
01:16:50.514 --> 01:16:51.916
I appreciate that.

976
01:16:59.290 --> 01:17:00.424
Why do you do it?

977
01:17:09.300 --> 01:17:11.835
I've asked myself that
thousands of times.


978
01:17:15.806 --> 01:17:19.877
All I could tell you is that I'm
wired different than most people.


979
01:17:23.948 --> 01:17:25.449
Well, maybe I am, too.

980
01:17:30.254 --> 01:17:34.124
We both kill.
Just for different reasons.


981
01:17:36.393 --> 01:17:37.394
Yeah.

982
01:17:41.398 --> 01:17:43.067
Does it have to be women?

983
01:17:45.569 --> 01:17:46.770
Why?

984
01:17:50.140 --> 01:17:51.275
I don't know, I was...

985
01:17:53.510 --> 01:17:57.114
I was thinking that this
doesn't have to be the end,


986
01:17:57.147 --> 01:18:01.018
like maybe we could come up
with an arrangement.


987
01:18:04.054 --> 01:18:04.822
Go on.

988
01:18:07.491 --> 01:18:09.360
Maybe I could throw some men
your way


989
01:18:09.393 --> 01:18:13.831
and we already know
each other's secrets, so...


990
01:18:18.936 --> 01:18:23.440
- Sex is good.
- Yeah.


991
01:18:25.843 --> 01:18:28.045
I'm willing to give it a shot
if you are.


992
01:18:42.860 --> 01:18:44.061
It's Fred.

993
01:19:07.985 --> 01:19:11.455
What do you have to say now?
Nothing. Nothing.


994
01:19:12.356 --> 01:19:16.026
You don't kill me. I kill you.

995
01:19:25.536 --> 01:19:28.072
Never fuck with me.
My mother fucked with me.


996
01:19:28.105 --> 01:19:32.042
My dad fucked with me.
You don't fuck with me anymore. Anymore.


997
01:19:45.500 --> 01:19:50.500
