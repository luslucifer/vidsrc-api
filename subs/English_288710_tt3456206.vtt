7
00:02:46.917 --> 00:02:49.693
You been out here all night?

8
00:02:50.353 --> 00:02:53.300
You're blocking the driveway.

9
00:05:04.254 --> 00:05:06.255
Are you here by yourself'?

10
00:05:06.256 --> 00:05:07.823
Mostly.

11
00:05:07.824 --> 00:05:09.258
More coffee?

12
00:05:09.259 --> 00:05:11.068
Please.

13
00:05:14.831 --> 00:05:16.674
No milk.

14
00:05:17.267 --> 00:05:20.077
Headed out west'?

15
00:05:21.771 --> 00:05:24.115
East.

16
00:05:26.076 --> 00:05:28.078
Away from...

17
00:05:29.045 --> 00:05:30.279
Yeah.

18
00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:33.249
He's probably reading
my note about now.


19
00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:36.051
"By the time I get to Phoenix"?

20
00:05:36.052 --> 00:05:38.089
More or less.

21
00:05:39.689 --> 00:05:41.223
Nice place you got.

22
00:05:41.224 --> 00:05:43.135
You're kidding, right'?

23
00:05:44.794 --> 00:05:47.900
Oh, no, no.
First one's on me.


24
00:05:48.765 --> 00:05:50.244
Thanks.

25
00:05:54.137 --> 00:05:56.583
You okay?

26
00:05:58.742 --> 00:06:02.019
I could really use a shower.

27
00:06:02.178 --> 00:06:07.178
I'd rather not use one
of the rooms right now, but...


28
00:06:09.986 --> 00:06:11.887
Good morning.

29
00:06:13.723 --> 00:06:15.725
Good morning.

30
00:06:23.867 --> 00:06:25.601
Sleep okay?

31
00:06:25.602 --> 00:06:27.582
I slept fine.

32
00:06:28.538 --> 00:06:29.983
Eggs?

33
00:06:33.910 --> 00:06:36.845
You know, why don't you
use my shower.


34
00:06:36.846 --> 00:06:39.281
Soap's nicer than in the rooms.

35
00:06:39.282 --> 00:06:42.217
Make your skin pretty.

36
00:06:42.218 --> 00:06:43.852
Prettier.

37
00:07:17.554 --> 00:07:19.591
This your car?

38
00:07:20.824 --> 00:07:23.192
Can't drive like that.
Tire's flat.


39
00:07:23.193 --> 00:07:25.160
It was driving fine last night.

40
00:07:25.161 --> 00:07:28.063
Well, probably was a slow leak.

41
00:07:28.064 --> 00:07:29.798
Got a spare'?

42
00:07:29.799 --> 00:07:31.300
That was my spare.

43
00:07:31.301 --> 00:07:34.908
Well, miss, lucky I'm here.

44
00:07:51.955 --> 00:07:53.856
Where you headed'?

45
00:07:53.857 --> 00:07:54.990
Twin Cities.

46
00:07:54.991 --> 00:07:57.292
Taking the back roads, huh?
Yeah.


47
00:07:57.293 --> 00:08:00.996
I always feel like the semis are
gonna drive me off the freeway.


48
00:08:00.997 --> 00:08:05.100
You spend any time in Flagstaff?
Passed through.


49
00:08:05.101 --> 00:08:08.137
Seems like a nice town.

50
00:08:08.138 --> 00:08:10.806
On the surface maybe.

51
00:08:10.807 --> 00:08:13.842
Most towns seem nice
on the surface.


52
00:08:13.843 --> 00:08:16.245
In the day, on Main Street.

53
00:08:16.246 --> 00:08:20.115
But at night,
in the bars, motel rooms,


54
00:08:20.116 --> 00:08:23.097
it's a whole nother story.

55
00:08:26.856 --> 00:08:28.096
Yeah.

56
00:08:28.691 --> 00:08:33.003
The nicer the town,
the dirtier the crime.


57
00:08:34.064 --> 00:08:36.203
Spousal abuse.

58
00:08:36.599 --> 00:08:37.733
Molestation.

59
00:08:37.734 --> 00:08:41.570
Drugs. Prostitution. Murder.
Every town's got 'em.


60
00:08:41.571 --> 00:08:44.279
Everyone's guilty of something.

61
00:08:46.943 --> 00:08:49.011
Not a nail after all.

62
00:08:49.012 --> 00:08:51.013
Looks like
your tire got screwed.


63
00:08:59.756 --> 00:09:01.890
Surprised to see you here.

64
00:09:01.891 --> 00:09:05.294
On my way home from Flagstaff.
Long night.


65
00:09:05.295 --> 00:09:05.994
Flagstaff?

66
00:09:05.995 --> 00:09:09.164
Yeah, they wanted
all hands on deck.


67
00:09:09.165 --> 00:09:10.265
Gruesome scene.

68
00:09:10.266 --> 00:09:14.002
You'll hear about it on the
evening news, I'm sure. Mm-hmm.


69
00:09:14.003 --> 00:09:16.839
You mind fetching
Officer Gault some coffee?


70
00:09:16.840 --> 00:09:19.708
Sure. To-go cups
are in the back.


71
00:09:19.709 --> 00:09:23.145
Well, that's my name, Miss...
Laine.


72
00:09:23.146 --> 00:09:27.151
Laine. I'd like it
light and sweet.


73
00:09:53.543 --> 00:09:56.145
You find everything
you're looking for'?


74
00:09:56.146 --> 00:09:57.913
Yeah, I think so.

75
00:09:57.914 --> 00:09:59.181
This place is a dive.

76
00:09:59.182 --> 00:10:03.085
There's plenty of nicer
motels off the freeway.


77
00:10:03.086 --> 00:10:06.158
Maybe I don't like the freeway.

78
00:10:09.659 --> 00:10:11.126
Here you go.

79
00:10:11.127 --> 00:10:13.073
Thanks.

80
00:10:14.964 --> 00:10:16.999
Sweet, but not too sweet.

81
00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:18.901
Just the way I like it.
This one's a keeper.


82
00:10:18.902 --> 00:10:23.044
Officer Gault.
Are you there'? Hold on a minute.


83
00:10:24.174 --> 00:10:27.951
How about it'?
How about what'?


84
00:10:29.712 --> 00:10:32.352
Hey, gotta run.
Just need to finish the air.


85
00:10:32.582 --> 00:10:35.317
But it should hold up till
you get where you're going.


86
00:10:35.318 --> 00:10:38.697
Thank you.
My pleasure.


87
00:10:41.791 --> 00:10:43.361
How about staying on?

88
00:10:43.593 --> 00:10:45.928
This place could use
a fresh face.


89
00:10:45.929 --> 00:10:48.000
Free room and board.

90
00:10:48.131 --> 00:10:52.367
I would, um, but my mother's
expecting me up in Minneapolis.


91
00:10:52.368 --> 00:10:55.872
Suit yourself.

92
00:10:57.173 --> 00:10:59.107
Luanne.

93
00:10:59.108 --> 00:11:01.777
I sure would appreciate
a room though.


94
00:11:01.778 --> 00:11:03.979
- Just for the night?
- You can have 3.


95
00:11:03.980 --> 00:11:08.684
But if I get any paying customers,
you're gonna need to clear out.


96
00:11:08.685 --> 00:11:10.255
Okay.

97
00:12:04.674 --> 00:12:08.744
- Flynn, baby, you better be waiting
for me. - Indeed I am, my darling.


98
00:12:08.745 --> 00:12:13.181
I just thought my momentum might
help get you out the door.


99
00:12:13.182 --> 00:12:15.219
Christ.

100
00:12:20.223 --> 00:12:24.296
This dump is deserted.
What did I tell you'?


101
00:12:25.194 --> 00:12:26.728
But I love my diamonds.

102
00:12:26.729 --> 00:12:30.198
You need to wear them
while eating a cheeseburger'?


103
00:12:30.199 --> 00:12:33.835
They don't have steak'?
Gloria, please.


104
00:12:33.836 --> 00:12:36.772
Kidding.
Okay, okay.


105
00:12:36.773 --> 00:12:39.652
Ooh, Jesus Christ.

106
00:14:04.193 --> 00:14:06.298
Piece of junk!

107
00:14:10.199 --> 00:14:13.669
Gloria, open the door.

108
00:14:15.872 --> 00:14:18.106
Will you take that out
to the car for me'?


109
00:14:18.107 --> 00:14:21.143
Gloria, you're not leaving.
The hell I'm not!


110
00:14:21.144 --> 00:14:25.080
- And where will you go'?
- The closest hotel.


111
00:14:25.081 --> 00:14:27.082
Don't be unreasonable.

112
00:14:27.083 --> 00:14:31.086
Did you hear the way
she was talking to me'?


113
00:14:31.087 --> 00:14:32.087
And that place.

114
00:14:32.088 --> 00:14:35.924
Ten minutes in there, and I feel
like there's grease all over me.


115
00:14:35.925 --> 00:14:37.993
And what about your brother?

116
00:14:37.994 --> 00:14:40.634
Eddie can visit me at the hotel.

117
00:14:40.963 --> 00:14:43.098
Where's my jacket'?

118
00:14:43.099 --> 00:14:44.332
Gloria, please.

119
00:14:44.333 --> 00:14:48.804
Have you forgotten the
reason as to why we are here'?


120
00:14:48.805 --> 00:14:51.006
I have not.
Then for God's sake,


121
00:14:51.007 --> 00:14:54.079
will you please try
and be sensible?


122
00:14:54.310 --> 00:14:55.210
Look, after tomorrow night,

123
00:14:55.211 --> 00:15:00.211
we're not going to have to worry
about money for a very long time.


124
00:15:00.683 --> 00:15:03.852
Gloria, Mr. Dunbar
was good to us.


125
00:15:03.853 --> 00:15:05.833
Two big ones.

126
00:15:08.324 --> 00:15:10.926
So tomorrow night we leave'?

127
00:15:10.927 --> 00:15:12.531
Yes.

128
00:15:12.829 --> 00:15:15.664
After they make
the drop-off.


129
00:15:15.665 --> 00:15:16.998
Okay?

130
00:15:16.999 --> 00:15:18.300
Oh, come on.

131
00:15:18.301 --> 00:15:23.301
Darling, why don't you take
one of your little pills


132
00:15:24.140 --> 00:15:26.746
and get ready for bed?

133
00:15:29.912 --> 00:15:31.780
Where are your pills?

134
00:15:31.781 --> 00:15:34.022
Should be in there.

135
00:15:39.155 --> 00:15:41.156
Well,
I don't see them.


136
00:15:41.157 --> 00:15:44.764
There's a new bottle
in the bathroom.


137
00:15:49.131 --> 00:15:50.799
Here, darling.

138
00:15:50.800 --> 00:15:53.835
I never wanna come back
to this rotten place.


139
00:15:53.836 --> 00:15:55.873
Of course not.

- Good morning.
- Morning.


149
00:18:51.814 --> 00:18:55.318
I slept very well last night.
Happy to hear.


150
00:18:55.551 --> 00:18:58.687
- I woke up this morning, and I was thinking...
- It's too late.


151
00:18:58.688 --> 00:19:01.828
I've changed my mind.
I don't need you anymore.


152
00:19:04.593 --> 00:19:05.927
I really do need a job.

153
00:19:05.928 --> 00:19:08.063
Then why did you turn it down'?

154
00:19:08.064 --> 00:19:11.602
See, that's why
you sleep in a car.


155
00:19:15.671 --> 00:19:16.805
Are you going
to order something?


156
00:19:16.806 --> 00:19:21.516
Because if you're not, we do
reserve the stools for customers.


157
00:19:22.645 --> 00:19:25.580
Well'?
I'm sorry, Luanne.


158
00:19:25.581 --> 00:19:27.652
I was wrong.

159
00:19:27.883 --> 00:19:30.785
I was hurting
and... and tired.


160
00:19:30.786 --> 00:19:34.089
I couldn't think past
getting some rest.


161
00:19:34.090 --> 00:19:38.732
It was very kind of you to
make the offer. I'll say.


162
00:19:40.996 --> 00:19:41.996
Please.

163
00:19:41.997 --> 00:19:46.234
I'm afraid if I don't have
something to cling to right now,


164
00:19:46.235 --> 00:19:49.037
I'll run back to him
all over again.


165
00:19:49.038 --> 00:19:52.874
You're not missing him,
are you'?


166
00:19:52.875 --> 00:19:55.253
It's a vicious cycle.

167
00:19:55.845 --> 00:19:59.581
What about your mother
in Minneapolis?


168
00:19:59.582 --> 00:20:03.118
To be honest,
she doesn't have much.


169
00:20:03.119 --> 00:20:04.886
She drinks.

170
00:20:04.887 --> 00:20:08.130
I suppose I'll just be a burden.

171
00:20:13.295 --> 00:20:17.141
You sure have an odd way
of showing gratitude.


172
00:20:22.605 --> 00:20:25.273
Is that the blouse
you wore yesterday'?


173
00:20:25.274 --> 00:20:27.742
Yeah. I washed it
in the sink.


174
00:20:27.743 --> 00:20:29.978
Well, we'll have to do
something about that.


175
00:20:29.979 --> 00:20:33.324
Where should I start'?
Well...


176
00:20:52.701 --> 00:20:54.302
Who put the noose
around your neck'?


177
00:20:54.303 --> 00:20:57.205
Hey, goddamn it, Lee!
Leave her alone.


178
00:20:57.206 --> 00:20:59.345
She's a good kid.

179
00:21:05.114 --> 00:21:07.015
- Good morning.
- Morning.


180
00:21:09.318 --> 00:21:11.653
Hi. Would you like
some coffee?


181
00:21:11.654 --> 00:21:16.194
If you're pouring, I shall
drink whatever you've got.


182
00:21:21.330 --> 00:21:22.997
Good morning.

183
00:21:22.998 --> 00:21:25.035
Morning.

184
00:21:26.001 --> 00:21:27.268
On vacation'?

185
00:21:27.269 --> 00:21:29.337
Headed for Palm Springs.

186
00:21:29.338 --> 00:21:32.707
My wife likes to think
that she can golf.


187
00:21:32.708 --> 00:21:34.976
Can't she'?
She can swing.


188
00:21:34.977 --> 00:21:37.245
Can't hit the ball,
but she can swing.


189
00:21:37.246 --> 00:21:40.114
Put on a fresh pot,
will ya, doll'?


190
00:21:40.115 --> 00:21:44.118
Oh. I should probably get one
of those to go, for the wife.


191
00:21:44.119 --> 00:21:45.687
She has a tough time
falling asleep,


192
00:21:45.688 --> 00:21:50.091
but once she goes down,
a cadaver is easier to wake up.


193
00:21:50.092 --> 00:21:52.368
And how long will you
stay in Palm Springs?


194
00:21:52.595 --> 00:21:54.896
Shouldn't you be scrubbing
a toilet or something'?


195
00:21:59.368 --> 00:22:02.770
- Well, look who stayed.
- Good morning.


196
00:22:02.771 --> 00:22:07.141
I was driving by and saw that Nova
still out there. I had a hunch.


197
00:22:07.142 --> 00:22:11.246
Well, I best check on the wife.

198
00:22:11.247 --> 00:22:14.849
Oh, hey, mister,
do I know you from somewhere?


199
00:22:14.850 --> 00:22:18.853
Excuse me. Didn't you want a
to-go cup for your wife'?


200
00:22:18.854 --> 00:22:21.189
Oh, yes. Thank you.

201
00:22:21.190 --> 00:22:23.725
They took 'em!

202
00:22:23.726 --> 00:22:24.826
- The diamonds!
- What'?


203
00:22:24.827 --> 00:22:26.794
They took my diamond necklace!

204
00:22:26.795 --> 00:22:29.631
Now, sweetie, will you
try and calm down?


205
00:22:29.632 --> 00:22:30.732
Oh, thank God, Officer.

206
00:22:30.733 --> 00:22:33.601
Someone broke into my room
and stole my diamond necklace.


207
00:22:33.602 --> 00:22:36.704
Officer, my wife
is obviously mistaken.


208
00:22:36.705 --> 00:22:38.339
I am not mistaken.

209
00:22:38.340 --> 00:22:40.341
Don't you call me mistaken!

210
00:22:40.342 --> 00:22:45.052
I always put it in the side
pocket of my suitcase.


211
00:22:46.148 --> 00:22:48.182
You! I bet you know
where they are!


212
00:22:48.183 --> 00:22:51.953
I suggest you listen to
your husband and calm down.


213
00:22:51.954 --> 00:22:55.323
Now, Officer, I'm dreadfully sorry
that you've been pulled into this.


214
00:22:55.324 --> 00:22:58.726
- He's trying to help!
- But this is the third time this week


215
00:22:58.727 --> 00:23:01.362
that my wife has misplaced
her zirconia necklace.


216
00:23:01.363 --> 00:23:03.798
She's always worried that
someone's going to steal it,


217
00:23:03.799 --> 00:23:06.100
so she hides it so well
that she can't find it.


218
00:23:06.101 --> 00:23:08.236
I most certainly did not hide it!
And besides...


219
00:23:08.237 --> 00:23:11.673
No, darling, why don't you and
I just go search the room'?


220
00:23:11.674 --> 00:23:13.314
Yeah, maybe you should go
and double-check


221
00:23:13.542 --> 00:23:17.012
before you trouble
the officer any further.


222
00:23:23.953 --> 00:23:25.591
Okay.

223
00:23:25.854 --> 00:23:28.990
But I did not hide it.
Come on, darling.


224
00:23:28.991 --> 00:23:35.203
And if I don't find it, I'll
bring in the whole damn force!


225
00:23:35.631 --> 00:23:37.198
Of course you will, darling.
Come on.


226
00:23:37.199 --> 00:23:39.801
So, you're still
on that Flagstaff case'?


227
00:23:39.802 --> 00:23:44.772
Between that and the Dunbar
heist, our hands are full.


228
00:23:44.773 --> 00:23:46.941
We're making progress.

229
00:23:46.942 --> 00:23:48.943
Hey. Join me outside
for a smoke'?


230
00:23:48.944 --> 00:23:52.213
Wish I could,
but I'm on the clock.


231
00:23:52.214 --> 00:23:54.660
Go ahead.

232
00:23:57.753 --> 00:24:01.756
Must have been a real good
reason made you stay.


233
00:24:01.757 --> 00:24:03.791
Needed a job.
Got one.


234
00:24:03.792 --> 00:24:04.359
Mmm.

235
00:24:04.360 --> 00:24:07.729
I know a girl in a hurry
when I see one.


236
00:24:07.730 --> 00:24:09.030
Uh, found it!

237
00:24:09.031 --> 00:24:10.765
Under the mattress, of course!

238
00:24:10.766 --> 00:24:14.543
Thanks so much for your help!

239
00:24:17.940 --> 00:24:20.074
I should get back to work.

240
00:24:20.075 --> 00:24:23.211
You don't need to be coy with me.
I'm not.


241
00:24:23.212 --> 00:24:24.912
Here's what I'm thinking.

242
00:24:24.913 --> 00:24:26.080
9:00 my shift ends.

243
00:24:26.081 --> 00:24:30.952
Pick you up, bring you back to my house.
I'll throw some rib eye on the grill.


244
00:24:30.953 --> 00:24:35.231
We'll drink some wine
and discuss our situation.


245
00:24:35.891 --> 00:24:38.337
You're barking up
the wrong tree, Officer.


246
00:24:38.560 --> 00:24:39.894
You're not serious.

247
00:24:39.895 --> 00:24:43.934
Your kind will
never do it for me.


248
00:24:44.967 --> 00:24:47.709
Better if you left me alone.

249
00:24:47.870 --> 00:24:53.843
Desert's a lonely place, so don't
come scratching at my door.


250
00:25:30.012 --> 00:25:32.219
Nice to see you too, pops.

251
00:25:35.317 --> 00:25:37.752
Loraine, right?
Luanne.


252
00:25:37.753 --> 00:25:42.156
Yeah. Well, I'm gonna need the
key to my room. I'm gonna crash.


253
00:25:42.157 --> 00:25:46.003
How's room 2?
Yeah, that's fine.


254
00:25:46.562 --> 00:25:49.330
Oh, hey, and got any aspirin'?

255
00:25:49.331 --> 00:25:52.200
Thanks. If I'm not in
a bed in 30 seconds,


256
00:25:52.201 --> 00:25:55.648
I'm gonna pass out
right here on the floor.


257
00:25:56.905 --> 00:26:00.648
Don't worry.
I'll be up by 8:00.


258
00:26:17.292 --> 00:26:19.533

Ooh.


297
00:29:29.851 --> 00:29:31.185
A girl after my own heart.

I bet you say
that to all the girls.

will you?

Makes it feel

301
00:29:46.935 --> 00:29:48.069
Ahh.

302
00:29:48.070 --> 00:29:51.813
Like water on a desert rose.

303
00:29:56.878 --> 00:29:58.279
I like your style.

304
00:29:58.280 --> 00:29:59.980
I aim to please.
You should try my margarita.


305
00:29:59.981 --> 00:30:06.523
I don't think there's a drink more suited
for a celebration than a margarita.


306
00:30:07.255 --> 00:30:08.189
Champagne?

307
00:30:08.190 --> 00:30:11.726
That's not a drink.
That is a soda.


308
00:30:12.994 --> 00:30:14.962
Flynn, baby, come on!

309
00:30:14.963 --> 00:30:18.775
Hell hath no fury
like a woman bored.


310
00:30:19.301 --> 00:30:20.968
Why don't you take her out'?

311
00:30:20.969 --> 00:30:23.779
Like to the desert
and shoot her'?


312
00:30:24.606 --> 00:30:26.340
Ah.

313
00:30:26.341 --> 00:30:31.341
I swear, she is heaven
when she's in her element.


314
00:30:31.680 --> 00:30:33.948
Here, not so much.

315
00:30:33.949 --> 00:30:36.150
Oh, yeah'?
Well, thanks again.


316
00:30:36.151 --> 00:30:40.187
And I'll be back around 7:00
for those margaritas.


317
00:30:40.188 --> 00:30:41.861
Until then.

318
00:30:42.190 --> 00:30:44.727
Where has she gone'?

319
00:30:46.161 --> 00:30:47.868
Darling.

320
00:31:44.186 --> 00:31:46.223
Where are you'?

321
00:32:00.101 --> 00:32:04.104
In Flagstaff, police continue to
investigate the homicide at a local motel.


322
00:32:04.105 --> 00:32:09.105
The body was discovered yesterday morning
after report's of a noise disturbance.


323
00:32:09.377 --> 00:32:12.613
The victim has now been
identified as Jed H. Burnham,


324
00:32:12.614 --> 00:32:14.682
son of oil tycoon H.W. Burnham.

325
00:32:14.683 --> 00:32:18.018
Burnham, vice president of Southwest
Oil and Phoenix area resident,


326
00:32:18.019 --> 00:32:23.019
was believed to be in the area for acquisition
of land holdings in the southern region.


327
00:32:23.291 --> 00:32:24.325
Considered a rising
political favorite,


328
00:32:24.326 --> 00:32:28.229
Burnham's gruesome murder has sent shook
waves through the local community.


329
00:32:28.230 --> 00:32:30.698
No suspects are yet
in custody,


330
00:32:30.699 --> 00:32:34.579
NN but local and state police
are...


331
00:32:45.780 --> 00:32:49.216
Hope I'm not bothering you.
Mm-mmm.


332
00:32:49.217 --> 00:32:51.952
Just about to take a nap.

333
00:32:51.953 --> 00:32:53.899
May I?

334
00:33:01.029 --> 00:33:04.131
What do you think?
It's pretty.


335
00:33:04.132 --> 00:33:05.907
Try it on.

336
00:33:19.314 --> 00:33:21.749
This was yours?
Mm-hmm.


337
00:33:21.750 --> 00:33:24.585
A gift from Maxine's on Melrose.

338
00:33:24.586 --> 00:33:27.692
Johnny had impeccable taste.

339
00:33:29.591 --> 00:33:30.758
Who's Johnny?

340
00:33:30.759 --> 00:33:34.172
Oh, a man from another life.

341
00:33:38.733 --> 00:33:40.634
Just as I thought.

342
00:33:40.635 --> 00:33:44.238
Looks better on you
than me. You like?


343
00:33:44.239 --> 00:33:45.639
Yeah, I do.

344
00:33:45.640 --> 00:33:48.075
Then it's yours.
Thanks.


345
00:33:48.076 --> 00:33:52.179
We'll have to do something
about this hair too.


346
00:33:52.180 --> 00:33:56.788
I know exactly how you
should get it cut.


347
00:33:57.919 --> 00:33:59.887
You're awfully nice to me.

348
00:33:59.888 --> 00:34:01.922
Well, you work for me now, doll,

349
00:34:01.923 --> 00:34:04.858
and if you look good,
I look good.


350
00:34:04.859 --> 00:34:09.063
Besides, maybe one day,
when we least expect it,


351
00:34:09.064 --> 00:34:11.932
you'll be able
to return the favor.


352
00:34:11.933 --> 00:34:13.867
Huh?

353
00:34:13.868 --> 00:34:15.569
Hope so.

354
00:34:15.570 --> 00:34:20.986
Let me know if you hear
or see anything, okay'?


355
00:34:21.309 --> 00:34:25.780
And don't nap too long.
I might need you.


356
00:34:48.036 --> 00:34:50.346
Mmm.

357
00:34:50.572 --> 00:34:51.346
Spared her life'?

358
00:34:51.573 --> 00:34:55.776
I decided to give
the old broad another chance.


359
00:34:55.777 --> 00:34:57.177

Eddie, you gotta see
what I got at the Injun shop.


372
00:35:39.954 --> 00:35:43.724
I got this for you,

my mom.

384
00:36:20.562 --> 00:36:23.297
Every day at 5:00,
she'd turn away from the TV


385
00:36:23.298 --> 00:36:26.867
and say, "You know
what time it is, sweetie?"


386
00:36:26.868 --> 00:36:28.836
And I'd make her a drink.

She's a friend of Luanne's.


440
00:39:13.768 --> 00:39:17.571
She's not a friend of Luanne's.

461
00:40:35.616 --> 00:40:39.987
Maybe she is exactly
who she says is... nobody.


462
00:40:39.988 --> 00:40:41.088
Please.

463
00:40:41.089 --> 00:40:43.695

I overheard.
Through the vent in my room.


474
00:41:20.028 --> 00:41:22.796
We didn't say anything
to anyone.

00:41:26.100 --> 00:41:28.635
She was upset because
she didn't want to be here.


477
00:41:28.636 --> 00:41:30.937
All of you idiots
are gonna wind up dead.


478
00:41:30.938 --> 00:41:34.775
Please, I won't say a word.
I swear. I won't go to the cops.


479
00:41:34.776 --> 00:41:35.876
I can't.

480
00:41:35.877 --> 00:41:37.982
I can't go to the cops.

481
00:41:39.747 --> 00:41:41.624
I'm wanted.

482
00:41:42.283 --> 00:41:44.017
What for'?

483
00:41:44.018 --> 00:41:45.852
Murder.

484
00:41:45.853 --> 00:41:48.255
But I didn't mean to kill him.

485
00:41:48.256 --> 00:41:49.156
Who'?

486
00:41:49.157 --> 00:41:51.792
They're gonna give me the chair.

487
00:41:51.793 --> 00:41:54.137
Was this in Flagstaff'?

488
00:41:54.796 --> 00:41:58.767
You're telling me
you killed Burnham'?


489
00:41:59.233 --> 00:42:00.167
Bullshit.
I swear.


490
00:42:00.168 --> 00:42:04.905
I met him in a parking lot.
We went back to his room.


491
00:42:04.906 --> 00:42:05.305
What for'?

492
00:42:05.306 --> 00:42:09.609
I just needed to get out of Flagstaff.
I thought he could help.


493
00:42:09.610 --> 00:42:11.283
Uh-huh.

494
00:42:11.712 --> 00:42:15.882
But as soon as we got
back to his room,


495
00:42:15.883 --> 00:42:17.317
he got silent.

496
00:42:17.318 --> 00:42:21.588
He grabbed me,
pinned me down on the bed,


497
00:42:21.589 --> 00:42:24.324
wrapped a belt around my neck.

498
00:42:24.325 --> 00:42:28.328
The more I fought,
the tighter he pulled.


499
00:42:28.329 --> 00:42:31.031
He was trying
to tear off my clothes.


500
00:42:31.032 --> 00:42:33.767
I wiggled an arm loose
and we fell on the floor,


501
00:42:33.768 --> 00:42:37.739
and he got the wind
knocked out of him.


502
00:42:38.773 --> 00:42:41.549
I could've left, but...

503
00:42:42.176 --> 00:42:44.247
I didn't.

504
00:42:45.079 --> 00:42:47.214
That's quite a page-turner.

505
00:42:47.215 --> 00:42:48.982
You don't believe me'?

506
00:42:48.983 --> 00:42:53.983
Honey, at this point, why should
I believe anything you tell me'?


507
00:42:54.355 --> 00:42:55.822
Wait. Wait.

508
00:42:55.823 --> 00:43:00.823
I have something of his. It's in
the bathroom, in the garbage can.


509
00:43:00.895 --> 00:43:02.662
In the café?

510
00:43:02.663 --> 00:43:03.830
Yes.

511
00:43:03.831 --> 00:43:07.711
- Gloria, check the garbage.
- Why me'?


512
00:43:15.776 --> 00:43:18.178
I didn't tell you
to bring the whole can.


513
00:43:18.179 --> 00:43:21.786
I'm not putting
my hand in there.


514
00:43:24.752 --> 00:43:26.288
Find it.

515
00:43:32.593 --> 00:43:35.328
I won't have a chance
if they catch me.


516
00:43:35.329 --> 00:43:37.998
They will give you the chair.

517
00:43:37.999 --> 00:43:40.834
But what's this got
to do with the money?


518
00:43:40.835 --> 00:43:42.815
I just thought...

519
00:43:42.937 --> 00:43:45.272
I just need
a couple thousand dollars.


520
00:43:45.273 --> 00:43:46.840
Just to get away.

521
00:43:46.841 --> 00:43:49.344
Leave the kid alone, Lee.
I'll give her the money.


522
00:43:49.577 --> 00:43:53.246
Why'? Not exactly gonna
break the bank, would it'?


523
00:43:53.247 --> 00:43:55.727
It's pathetic.

524
00:43:56.884 --> 00:43:58.752
I'll keep this.

525
00:43:58.753 --> 00:44:00.854
For insurance.

526
00:44:00.855 --> 00:44:03.657
That was them on the phone.

527
00:44:03.658 --> 00:44:08.195
There's been a snag. They don't
know when they'll be here.


528
00:44:08.196 --> 00:44:10.767
What does this mean'?

529
00:44:11.299 --> 00:44:13.540
Sorry, kid.

530
00:44:14.101 --> 00:44:16.980
Help her up, would you'?

531
00:44:20.575 --> 00:44:22.816
Just trying to help.

532
00:45:13.961 --> 00:45:17.306
I fucking knew it. We should've
split the money when we had it.


533
00:45:17.531 --> 00:45:19.599
We could've been
in Mexico by now.


534
00:45:19.600 --> 00:45:20.305
That wasn't an option.

535
00:45:20.534 --> 00:45:23.737
And to add insult, they're gonna
take a out just to clean the money?


536
00:45:23.738 --> 00:45:28.074
The bills were marked.
They'd have found you in a day.


537
00:45:28.075 --> 00:45:29.609
And she...

538
00:45:29.610 --> 00:45:32.746
She's taking a full cut,
and she wasn't even there.


539
00:45:32.747 --> 00:45:35.115
Don't you forget, boy.
This is my place!


540
00:45:35.116 --> 00:45:37.617
And it's my connection
that's cleaning the money!


541
00:45:37.618 --> 00:45:38.318
Supposedly cleaning the money.

542
00:45:38.319 --> 00:45:42.155
They'll never show up, or if they
do, they won't bring the money.


543
00:45:42.156 --> 00:45:44.157
They'll bring a bullet
for each of us.


544
00:45:44.158 --> 00:45:46.593
You think that's true?
No.


545
00:45:46.594 --> 00:45:49.596
Luanne's known
these people for decades.


546
00:45:49.597 --> 00:45:52.771
She's just a washed-up showgirl.

547
00:45:52.967 --> 00:45:55.935
You fucking crazy'?

548
00:45:55.936 --> 00:45:59.339
- I'm not afraid to punch a woman!
- You should be!


549
00:45:59.340 --> 00:46:00.840
Eddie, sit down.

550
00:46:00.841 --> 00:46:02.075
You're not my boss.

551
00:46:02.076 --> 00:46:05.078
Boss or no boss, sit down.

552
00:46:05.079 --> 00:46:07.647
Now, let's take
a breather, boys.


553
00:46:07.648 --> 00:46:11.051
Fighting isn't going
to get us anywhere.


554
00:46:11.052 --> 00:46:13.019
We're almost at the
finish line, right'?


555
00:46:13.020 --> 00:46:16.089
- If the money's delivered.
- It's gonna be delivered.


556
00:46:25.066 --> 00:46:27.546
Frontier.

557
00:46:28.302 --> 00:46:29.235
Yes.

558
00:46:29.236 --> 00:46:32.038
They'll be here within the hour.

559
00:46:32.039 --> 00:46:37.614
See, everything is on track.
We just need to relax.


560
00:46:38.179 --> 00:46:42.882
And look, we haven't even tried
Laine's cherry margarita.


561
00:46:43.584 --> 00:46:47.220
You all just want to sit around
drinking cherry margaritas'?


562
00:46:47.221 --> 00:46:49.929
Lee, would you like
to do the honors?


563
00:46:52.126 --> 00:46:55.573
What you need to do is sober up.

564
00:46:55.696 --> 00:46:59.838
You do know I'm more
sober when I drink.


565
00:47:00.034 --> 00:47:02.135
- I'll make coffee.
- Stay right where you are.


566
00:47:02.136 --> 00:47:06.243
- Luanne will make it.
- Do I look like I work here'?


567
00:47:10.010 --> 00:47:11.887
Okay.

568
00:47:22.123 --> 00:47:24.899
Can I have one of those?

569
00:47:26.193 --> 00:47:28.561
Last one.

570
00:47:28.562 --> 00:47:29.262
Oh.

571
00:47:29.263 --> 00:47:31.965
I guess I didn't steal
your necklace after all.


572
00:47:31.966 --> 00:47:34.234
Well, I can't explain it.

573
00:47:34.235 --> 00:47:37.170
First it wasn't there,
then it was.


574
00:47:37.171 --> 00:47:39.005
You were in the movies, right?

575
00:47:39.006 --> 00:47:42.249
Spent some time
in glitter. Yeah.


576
00:47:42.643 --> 00:47:44.144
Must have been fabulous.

577
00:47:44.145 --> 00:47:47.024
I'd be lying
if I said it wasn't.


578
00:47:47.715 --> 00:47:50.283
- So Why'd you quit?
- Who says I quit?


579
00:47:50.284 --> 00:47:55.284
Was it because you didn't
quite have what it takes'?


580
00:47:56.023 --> 00:47:58.158
No, that's what happened to me.

581
00:47:58.159 --> 00:47:59.926
I was studying,
and my teacher said,


582
00:47:59.927 --> 00:48:02.929
"You got the looks,
but you don't got "it."'


583
00:48:02.930 --> 00:48:03.897
And I said, "What's "if?"

584
00:48:03.898 --> 00:48:08.898
And he said, "If you don't know what
"it' is, that means you don't got it."


585
00:48:09.170 --> 00:48:12.806
Well, I definitely had it.

586
00:48:12.807 --> 00:48:13.139
Oh.

587
00:48:13.140 --> 00:48:16.042
- It was because of her boyfriend.
- Excuse me'?


588
00:48:16.043 --> 00:48:17.076
That's why you left.

589
00:48:17.077 --> 00:48:20.814
Because your brilliant boyfriend
put a hit out on a studio director


590
00:48:20.815 --> 00:48:22.015
'cause you didn't get a part.

591
00:48:22.016 --> 00:48:25.585
Johnny wasn't my boyfriend.
He was my fiancé.


592
00:48:25.586 --> 00:48:27.687
And that's not
the way it happened.


593
00:48:27.688 --> 00:48:29.189
Everyone having coffee'?

594
00:48:29.190 --> 00:48:32.262
- Yes.
- Not me.


595
00:48:32.626 --> 00:48:35.903
Keeps me awake.

596
00:48:48.642 --> 00:48:51.177
So why did you
leave the business?


597
00:48:51.178 --> 00:48:53.179
You know who Jack Warner was?

598
00:48:53.180 --> 00:48:56.316
He was some big-time
studio guy, right'? Yeah.


599
00:48:56.317 --> 00:48:59.924
Some big-time studio guy.

600
00:49:00.287 --> 00:49:03.323
Well, at the time,
I was doing bit parts


601
00:49:03.324 --> 00:49:05.959
in a series of low-budget
costume dramas,


602
00:49:05.960 --> 00:49:06.960
and Jack noticed me.

603
00:49:06.961 --> 00:49:10.096
Called me in for a screen
test for Dark Victory.


604
00:49:10.097 --> 00:49:14.807
That's the movie with Bette Davis.
My mom loved that movie.


605
00:49:15.102 --> 00:49:17.981
Should have been Luanne Brice.

606
00:49:18.239 --> 00:49:22.542
I did all the make-up tests,
the costume fittings.


607
00:49:22.543 --> 00:49:25.046
Oh, you should have seen me.

608
00:49:26.046 --> 00:49:29.115
And then, just days
before shooting,


609
00:49:29.116 --> 00:49:30.783
he calls me in for a meeting.

610
00:49:30.784 --> 00:49:33.653
Tells me the director
wants Davis instead of me


611
00:49:33.654 --> 00:49:36.689
and offers me some second-rate
flop in exchange.


612
00:49:36.690 --> 00:49:40.263
- What'd you do'?
- I told him to go fuck himself.


613
00:49:41.662 --> 00:49:46.771
So, what about that business with
your fiancé and the director'?


614
00:49:48.702 --> 00:49:50.670
That might have happened.

615
00:49:50.671 --> 00:49:52.972
But Johnny was just
giving him a scare.


616
00:49:52.973 --> 00:49:56.576
Splashed him and his little
poodle with some gasoline.


617
00:49:56.577 --> 00:49:58.311
That's all.

618
00:49:58.312 --> 00:50:00.580
But I didn't need Hollywood.
I had Johnny.


619
00:50:00.581 --> 00:50:05.318
Johnny was going to produce
a movie showcasing my talents,


620
00:50:05.319 --> 00:50:07.287
show the world what I could do.

621
00:50:07.288 --> 00:50:10.701
He hired a writer,
and we wrote a script.


622
00:50:11.725 --> 00:50:14.137
No Time for Tears.

623
00:50:15.029 --> 00:50:16.729
We were so close to making it.

624
00:50:16.730 --> 00:50:19.973
We were in Vegas,
raising the money, when...


625
00:50:21.001 --> 00:50:22.844
when...

626
00:50:25.773 --> 00:50:28.141
With Johnny gone,

627
00:50:28.142 --> 00:50:30.343
there was no picture.

628
00:50:30.344 --> 00:50:32.654
There was nothing.

629
00:50:32.913 --> 00:50:34.714
So you came here.

630
00:50:34.715 --> 00:50:37.250
Johnny won this place
in a bet years before,


631
00:50:37.251 --> 00:50:43.167
and I thought I'd just
hide out, rest a little.


632
00:50:44.658 --> 00:50:46.626
But it's funny how,

633
00:50:46.627 --> 00:50:48.761
when your heart's been choked,

634
00:50:48.762 --> 00:50:52.098
days turn into weeks,
into months,


635
00:50:52.099 --> 00:50:53.976
into years.

636
00:50:54.668 --> 00:50:56.306
Until...

637
00:50:57.638 --> 00:51:02.053
you wake up one day,
and you don't know who you are.


638
00:51:08.148 --> 00:51:10.016
Well.

639
00:51:10.017 --> 00:51:11.684
I hope I'm not boring you.

640
00:51:11.685 --> 00:51:18.603
Oh. No. I'm...
I'm just sleepy.


641
00:51:19.193 --> 00:51:21.673
Those margaritas.

642
00:51:22.296 --> 00:51:25.903
This Coffee's not doing much for me.

643
00:51:28.102 --> 00:51:31.070
Sure you
don't want some coffee'?


644
00:51:31.071 --> 00:51:32.709
Nah.

645
00:51:33.774 --> 00:51:36.812
I think I need some air.

646
00:51:41.582 --> 00:51:43.687
That's pretty good.

647
00:51:51.892 --> 00:51:54.930
I should
go check on her.


648
00:51:57.031 --> 00:51:59.671
"The Frontier."

649
00:52:00.167 --> 00:52:03.046
Cowboys and Indians.

650
00:52:03.971 --> 00:52:07.612
Makes you think of the past,
don't it'?


651
00:52:09.176 --> 00:52:12.316
But it's really
about the future.


652
00:52:12.546 --> 00:52:14.781
Okay. Come on.

653
00:52:14.782 --> 00:52:16.819
Let's go sit down.

654
00:52:17.317 --> 00:52:20.286
Think I drank too much.

655
00:52:20.287 --> 00:52:23.200
This never happens with juice.

656
00:52:28.762 --> 00:52:30.571
Oh.

657
00:52:35.269 --> 00:52:37.603
Is Eddie okay'?

658
00:52:37.604 --> 00:52:40.139
Yeah, Eddie's fine.

659
00:52:40.140 --> 00:52:42.677
Are you okay?

660
00:52:43.143 --> 00:52:44.986
Mm-hmm.

661
00:52:46.346 --> 00:52:50.055
That Lee, he hurt you.

662
00:52:51.618 --> 00:52:53.791
I'm gonna be okay.

663
00:52:58.759 --> 00:53:01.000
Eddie's so funny.

664
00:53:02.696 --> 00:53:06.143
I never get to see him anymore.

665
00:53:07.167 --> 00:53:11.274
He's always driving places.

666
00:53:17.010 --> 00:53:21.047
♪ Wait for the wagon ♪

667
00:53:21.048 --> 00:53:24.996
♪ Wait for the wagon ♪

668
00:53:25.819 --> 00:53:28.287
♪ Wait for the wagon ♪

669
00:53:28.288 --> 00:53:33.738
♪ And we'll all take a ride ♪

670
00:53:45.105 --> 00:53:47.813
Please don't let me die.

671
00:53:50.577 --> 00:53:53.786
You're not gonna die.

672
00:53:58.085 --> 00:53:59.928
Good.

673
00:54:00.921 --> 00:54:03.663
I don't wanna die.

674
00:54:18.939 --> 00:54:20.714
Eddie'?

675
00:54:22.009 --> 00:54:25.778
You... You put something
in the coffee.


676
00:54:25.779 --> 00:54:28.614
You put something in that drink.

677
00:54:28.615 --> 00:54:31.562
Didn't you?
Yes.


678
00:54:33.153 --> 00:54:35.121
What do you want?

679
00:54:35.122 --> 00:54:37.193
A thousand bucks?

680
00:54:38.125 --> 00:54:40.827
You can have it.

681
00:54:40.828 --> 00:54:42.929
That's nice, Eddie.

682
00:54:42.930 --> 00:54:45.934
But I don't want
a thousand bucks.


683
00:54:46.333 --> 00:54:48.668
I want it all.

684
00:54:48.669 --> 00:54:49.807
You...

685
00:55:00.848 --> 00:55:02.953
Luanne.

686
00:56:10.684 --> 00:56:13.528
Surprised to see you
open so late.


687
00:56:13.787 --> 00:56:15.187
Yeah.

688
00:56:15.188 --> 00:56:18.057
Some of the guests
had a little party here,


689
00:56:18.058 --> 00:56:20.971
and I got stuck
with the cleanup.


690
00:56:21.895 --> 00:56:23.195
Run out of rooms'?

691
00:56:23.196 --> 00:56:26.132
I think he had
a little too much gin.


692
00:56:26.133 --> 00:56:26.999
Luanne said just to leave him.

693
00:56:27.000 --> 00:56:32.000
If my father was here, he would write
that man a ticket for public drunkenness,


694
00:56:32.005 --> 00:56:34.974
then slip it in his wallet
to find when he wakes up.


695
00:56:34.975 --> 00:56:39.078
- Your dad's a cop'?
- Was. County sheriff.


696
00:56:39.079 --> 00:56:41.314
Died a couple of years back.

697
00:56:41.315 --> 00:56:43.015
I'm sorry.

698
00:56:43.016 --> 00:56:45.584
Yeah, he let the job
get the best of him.


699
00:56:45.585 --> 00:56:47.219
Didn't even make it
to retirement.


700
00:56:47.220 --> 00:56:51.324
I imagine it'd be hard not to.

701
00:56:55.862 --> 00:56:57.899
Look, I...

702
00:56:58.065 --> 00:57:03.065
I wanted to apologize
for the way I acted earlier.


703
00:57:03.136 --> 00:57:05.705
It's okay.
No.


704
00:57:05.706 --> 00:57:08.084
I was out of line.

705
00:57:08.208 --> 00:57:11.644
Been under a lot of
stress lately, you know,


706
00:57:11.645 --> 00:57:13.879
with this Flagstaff killing.

707
00:57:13.880 --> 00:57:16.615
Please. I'm sorry.

708
00:57:16.616 --> 00:57:20.655
You were just being friendly,
and I was...


709
00:57:21.555 --> 00:57:24.035
It's just been a while.

710
00:57:24.891 --> 00:57:27.531
I'm terrible at this.

711
00:57:27.661 --> 00:57:30.563
I don't know why,
but sometimes I'm scared


712
00:57:30.564 --> 00:57:32.771
of the very thing I want.

713
00:57:33.200 --> 00:57:34.266
Oh, yeah'?

714
00:57:34.267 --> 00:57:37.269
Got any time off this weekend'?

715
00:57:37.270 --> 00:57:39.972
What do you have in mind'?

716
00:57:39.973 --> 00:57:41.646
Rib eye?

717
00:57:42.142 --> 00:57:44.010
I think I might have Sunday off.

718
00:57:44.011 --> 00:57:47.049
Maybe you'll swing by
and pick me up.


719
00:57:47.681 --> 00:57:50.184
I'll think about it.

720
00:57:50.951 --> 00:57:55.661
Well, can I get you
some coffee before you go'?


721
00:57:56.223 --> 00:57:59.227
Yeah.
Coffee sounds good.


722
00:58:20.947 --> 00:58:27.557
You know, on second thought,
I'll take a Coke.


723
00:58:29.256 --> 00:58:30.923
You sure?

724
00:58:30.924 --> 00:58:32.725
Yep.

725
00:58:32.726 --> 00:58:36.902
But I'll take it to go.
I don't want to keep you.


726
00:58:48.308 --> 00:58:50.117
Need a straw?

727
00:58:53.280 --> 00:58:55.226
Much obliged.

728
00:59:07.961 --> 00:59:09.662
Who do you think did it'?

729
00:59:09.663 --> 00:59:12.576
Excuse me'?
Flagstaff.


730
00:59:13.233 --> 00:59:16.969
See, State thinks
it was someone who knew him,


731
00:59:16.970 --> 00:59:19.038
that it was a calculated hit
covered up to look


732
00:59:19.039 --> 00:59:24.039
like he was killed during a robbery
or some other kind of transaction.


733
00:59:24.811 --> 00:59:25.878
Oh, yeah'?

734
00:59:25.879 --> 00:59:31.261
How I see it, I think
he was killed by a whore.


735
00:59:32.119 --> 00:59:33.953
Hmm.

736
00:59:33.954 --> 00:59:35.588
But what do you think?

737
00:59:35.589 --> 00:59:40.589
You agree with me
or with the State'?


738
00:59:40.694 --> 00:59:43.195
I really have no idea.

739
00:59:43.196 --> 00:59:45.005
Well.

740
00:59:46.666 --> 00:59:49.044
Good thing you're not a cop.

741
01:02:33.867 --> 01:02:35.676
Fuck!

742
01:02:39.005 --> 01:02:41.713
No, no, no.

743
01:02:54.321 --> 01:02:57.962
Come on.

744
01:02:58.358 --> 01:03:01.260
Come on! Come on!

745
01:04:28.014 --> 01:04:29.615
He took it!
He took the money!


746
01:04:29.616 --> 01:04:31.817
Eddie'? He must have put
something in the coffee.


747
01:04:31.818 --> 01:04:35.154
You made the coffee. He's the
only one who didn't drink it.


748
01:04:35.155 --> 01:04:39.024
- The bastard!
- I tried to stop him, but...


749
01:04:39.025 --> 01:04:40.192
he knocked me out.

750
01:04:40.193 --> 01:04:41.727
You could do better than that.

751
01:04:41.728 --> 01:04:44.329
- I'm still here, aren't I'?
- What happened'?


752
01:04:44.330 --> 01:04:46.632
Did they deliver the money'?
Eddie took it.


753
01:04:46.633 --> 01:04:48.967
- Eddie?
- No. Eddie wouldn't do that!


754
01:04:48.968 --> 01:04:52.805
- Eddie wouldn't do that!
- Then where the hell is he'?


755
01:04:52.806 --> 01:04:53.305
I don't know!

756
01:04:53.306 --> 01:04:56.842
Maybe he took the money, and
he's bringing it somewhere safe.


757
01:04:56.843 --> 01:04:58.944
Somewhere safe'?
Stupid broad!


758
01:04:58.945 --> 01:05:02.214
We're taking your car. Everybody
get in the fucking car.


759
01:05:02.215 --> 01:05:04.183
Oh, Lee...
Now!


760
01:05:04.184 --> 01:05:08.690
You too, missy.
Nobody leaves my sight.


761
01:05:22.569 --> 01:05:23.569
He could be anywhere by now.

762
01:05:23.570 --> 01:05:28.173
Stop at the first gas station,
see if somebody spotted him.


763
01:05:28.174 --> 01:05:31.519
How are we
going to find him'?


764
01:05:32.078 --> 01:05:33.614
Gloria?

765
01:05:33.813 --> 01:05:36.949
- I don't know where he is.
- Take a guess.


766
01:05:36.950 --> 01:05:39.151
I don't know!

767
01:05:39.152 --> 01:05:42.955
- Why would he do this'?
- Ask him when we find him.


768
01:05:42.956 --> 01:05:45.257
Right now I just
wanna know where he is,


769
01:05:45.258 --> 01:05:48.296
so think, damn it, think!

770
01:05:52.165 --> 01:05:56.079
What is it'? There's
something up ahead.


771
01:06:03.309 --> 01:06:06.602
Flynn. Don't let him!
Don't let him, Flynn!


772
01:06:06.627 --> 01:06:07.748
All right.

773
01:06:23.696 --> 01:06:24.997
He left his gun?

774
01:06:24.998 --> 01:06:27.099
Actually, it looks like mine.

775
01:06:27.100 --> 01:06:28.767
Look! There's blood!

776
01:06:28.768 --> 01:06:31.303
There's blood on the road!

777
01:06:31.304 --> 01:06:32.938
Is it Eddie's'?

778
01:06:32.939 --> 01:06:34.106
Does he bleed red'?

779
01:06:34.107 --> 01:06:38.249
Come on, darling. Get in the car.
Just get in the car.


780
01:06:42.682 --> 01:06:44.716
He couldn't have gotten far.

781
01:06:44.717 --> 01:06:47.786
If we find him, will you
let me talk to him'?


782
01:06:47.787 --> 01:06:51.256
- Lee, will you let me talk to him first?
- .Jesus Christ!


783
01:06:51.257 --> 01:06:53.965
Shut the fuck up!

784
01:06:58.898 --> 01:07:02.277
Wait a minute.
What's that?


785
01:07:06.139 --> 01:07:07.914
That's Eddie!

786
01:07:08.942 --> 01:07:10.242
Oh! Eddie!

787
01:07:10.243 --> 01:07:13.845
Oh, my... Oh! Eddie.
Eddie. Eddie.


788
01:07:13.846 --> 01:07:16.748
Eddie!
Why did you do it'?


789
01:07:16.749 --> 01:07:19.718
Eddie, why did you do it'?

790
01:07:19.719 --> 01:07:22.054
You know I wouldn't.

791
01:07:22.055 --> 01:07:23.088
I was gonna...

792
01:07:23.089 --> 01:07:27.128
I don't care why he did it.
Is it all there?


793
01:07:29.028 --> 01:07:31.597
Lee, don't you do this!

794
01:07:31.598 --> 01:07:35.133
He's hurt! Look at him.
He's hurt!


795
01:07:35.134 --> 01:07:36.568
The coffee.

796
01:07:36.569 --> 01:07:40.672
- It was in the coffee.
- I know it was the coffee.


797
01:07:40.673 --> 01:07:42.874
No! You're a beast!
I won't let you do it!


798
01:07:42.875 --> 01:07:46.755
If you want to shoot him,
you'll have to go through me.


799
01:08:20.580 --> 01:08:22.821
Such a tragedy.

800
01:08:35.161 --> 01:08:38.199
Why the hell
did you have to kill her'?


801
01:08:38.665 --> 01:08:41.233
At this pace,
you may well be next.


802
01:08:41.234 --> 01:08:43.669
Now open the trunk.
Why?


803
01:08:43.670 --> 01:08:47.516
This is where you earn
your thousand dollars.


804
01:08:47.640 --> 01:08:50.678
I asked for 2,000.
Open it.


805
01:08:54.080 --> 01:08:55.313
Jesus Christ!

806
01:08:55.314 --> 01:08:57.582
Who the hell is that'?

807
01:08:57.583 --> 01:08:59.685
Eddie did this'?

808
01:08:59.686 --> 01:09:01.996
How?
How do you think'?


809
01:09:02.822 --> 01:09:04.589
Help me with the bodies.

810
01:09:04.590 --> 01:09:06.934
Let's get this done, now!

811
01:09:39.559 --> 01:09:41.971
I'm sorry.

812
01:09:47.700 --> 01:09:49.543
Flynn?

813
01:09:49.802 --> 01:09:52.248
You want me to drive'?

814
01:09:53.039 --> 01:09:55.707
Flynn?

815
01:10:36.048 --> 01:10:39.655
Stop it, Flynn!
Get off of her!


816
01:10:49.228 --> 01:10:52.107
Shoot him!
No.


817
01:10:58.905 --> 01:11:00.942
What a shame.

818
01:11:01.274 --> 01:11:04.118
Goddamn it.

819
01:11:05.378 --> 01:11:08.257
Just get me in the car.

820
01:11:13.886 --> 01:11:18.023
Tell me, what is it
that keeps you up at night?


821
01:11:18.024 --> 01:11:21.827
Luanne, there's a doctor
in New River.


822
01:11:21.828 --> 01:11:24.095
He'll take care of me there.

823
01:11:24.096 --> 01:11:26.898
Those aren't things
to worry about.


824
01:11:26.899 --> 01:11:29.968
Christmas is
right around the corner.


825
01:11:29.969 --> 01:11:31.670
And we're all here.

826
01:11:31.671 --> 01:11:33.238
Luanne, I'm gonna die.

827
01:11:33.239 --> 01:11:35.841
Don't you see'?

828
01:11:35.842 --> 01:11:38.109
There's no time for tears.

829
01:11:38.110 --> 01:11:42.714
Is... is that
from your goddamn movie'?


830
01:11:42.715 --> 01:11:45.958
Goddamn it, Luanne!

831
01:11:47.587 --> 01:11:48.653
Look.

832
01:11:48.654 --> 01:11:53.091
The snow is falling.
I think it's a sign.


833
01:11:53.092 --> 01:11:56.869
Next year will surely be heaven.

834
01:12:07.006 --> 01:12:09.816
Will you be a doll and drive'?

835
01:12:10.676 --> 01:12:12.043
But he's gonna die.

836
01:12:12.044 --> 01:12:15.914
We can't be going to New River.

837
01:12:15.915 --> 01:12:18.122
Not tonight.

838
01:12:23.022 --> 01:12:25.590
You've been such a big help.

839
01:12:25.591 --> 01:12:29.095
I'd hate to have to leave you.

840
01:12:39.171 --> 01:12:43.278
Well, that went better
than expected.


841
01:12:44.310 --> 01:12:46.211
Where are we going?

842
01:12:46.212 --> 01:12:48.214
The Frontier.

843
01:14:21.807 --> 01:14:25.744
I couldn't have done
this without you.


844
01:14:25.745 --> 01:14:31.627
So I want you to have this.

845
01:14:33.719 --> 01:14:36.988
I don't know
how much is in there,


846
01:14:36.989 --> 01:14:39.691
but it should last you a while.

847
01:14:39.692 --> 01:14:41.569
Go ahead.

848
01:14:42.094 --> 01:14:44.963
I don't know what to say.

849
01:14:44.964 --> 01:14:47.035
Thank you.

850
01:14:47.867 --> 01:14:50.101
Oh, you're so young.

851
01:14:50.102 --> 01:14:53.071
I'm gonna teach you
everything I know.


852
01:14:53.072 --> 01:14:56.875
Now, if you wouldn't mind,
go make us some coffee.


853
01:14:56.876 --> 01:15:01.848
I'm gonna round up a few
things before we hit the road.


854
01:15:02.281 --> 01:15:04.916
We don't have much time.

855
01:15:04.917 --> 01:15:06.726
Yeah.

856
01:15:47.293 --> 01:15:49.136
Laine'?

857
01:16:23.762 --> 01:16:26.174

01:19:21.740 --> 01:19:23.875
Drop the bag.

875
01:19:25.010 --> 01:19:28.583
Kneel.
Hands on your head.


876
01:19:54.073 --> 01:19:56.713
She's dead, isn't she?

877
01:20:08.120 --> 01:20:12.056
Dispatch. This is 62A
requesting backup.


878
01:20:12.057 --> 01:20:13.991
Your 926'?

879
01:20:13.992 --> 01:20:18.162
Frontier Motel.
Old 66. Truxton.


880
01:20:18.163 --> 01:20:20.298
Copy that. The situation'?

881
01:20:22.201 --> 01:20:24.836
We got at least
a half dozen bodies here.


882
01:20:24.837 --> 01:20:28.284
Half a mile down the road,
near a vehicle.


883
01:20:29.141 --> 01:20:32.844
And at least one here
at the motel.


884
01:20:32.845 --> 01:20:34.045
Jesus Christ.

885
01:20:34.046 --> 01:20:37.148
Looks like some of the players
from the Dunbar heist.


886
01:20:37.149 --> 01:20:39.755
Any sign of the money'?

887
01:20:40.953 --> 01:20:45.732
- Is this everything?
- As far as I know.


888
01:20:49.361 --> 01:20:51.662
No sign of the money,

889
01:20:51.663 --> 01:20:54.999
but I'll have backup
search the premises.


890
01:20:55.000 --> 01:20:57.173
Please stand by.

891
01:21:02.975 --> 01:21:06.210
Those people in the trunk...

892
01:21:06.211 --> 01:21:09.090
Eddie couldn't have killed them.

893
01:21:11.250 --> 01:21:13.985
And who are you?

894
01:21:13.986 --> 01:21:16.296
Just a customer.

895
01:21:25.931 --> 01:21:28.733
Picked the wrong motel,
didn't you?


896
01:21:28.734 --> 01:21:32.003
Woke up.
Heard some screaming.


897
01:21:32.004 --> 01:21:34.205
Gunshots down the road.

898
01:21:34.206 --> 01:21:38.313
Stepped out and almost
got yourself killed.


899
01:21:39.678 --> 01:21:42.682
Yeah, that sounds about right.

900
01:21:43.015 --> 01:21:46.851
In a few minutes, a whole lot
of people are gonna be here


901
01:21:46.852 --> 01:21:48.820
to clean up this shithole.

902
01:21:48.821 --> 01:21:54.066
Make sure you're here. They're
gonna ask you some questions.


903
01:21:54.626 --> 01:21:56.828
What am I supposed
to tell them'?


904
01:21:56.829 --> 01:21:59.673
The truth, naturally.

905
01:22:40.906 --> 01:22:43.978
And in Truxton, the
three-week search for those responsible


906
01:22:44.042 --> 01:22:47.211
in the Dunbar armored truck
heist ended in violence today.


907
01:22:47.212 --> 01:22:50.648
Three suspects-John Flynn,
Lee Towers and Eddie King...


908
01:22:50.649 --> 01:22:52.850
Were found dead along Route 66.

909
01:22:52.851 --> 01:22:55.353
The fourth, Luanne
Brice, was found dead


910
01:22:55.354 --> 01:22:56.654
at the local motel she owned.

911
01:22:56.655 --> 01:23:00.258
In a strange turn of events authorities
have also obtained evidence


912
01:23:00.259 --> 01:23:02.827
linking the thieves to the
murder of Jed H. Burnham,


913
01:23:02.828 --> 01:23:06.898
whose body was found earlier
this week at a Flagstaff motel.


914
01:23:06.899 --> 01:23:08.900
Burnham's father, H.W. Burnham,

915
01:23:08.901 --> 01:23:12.069
has commended police for
solving his son's murder.


916
01:23:12.070 --> 01:23:15.950
So far, no money has
been recovered.
