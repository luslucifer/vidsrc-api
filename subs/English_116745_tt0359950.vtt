I skipped it.

Okay, you got to
help me out here, man.

And bewildering.


162
00:11:20.738 --> 00:11:23.073
I should evaluate you,
you should evaluate me.


163
00:11:23.240 --> 00:11:24.617
I don't think
they'll let us do that.


164
00:11:24.783 --> 00:11:25.826
Just saying.

165
00:11:29.455 --> 00:11:32.958
Hey, how long has this neg roll
been here... out in the open?


166
00:11:36.337 --> 00:11:37.379
It says "Sean O'Connell."

167
00:11:37.546 --> 00:11:39.215
It came in this morning.

168
00:11:39.381 --> 00:11:42.259
There's a present, too. He sent
you a present, on your desk.


169
00:11:44.094 --> 00:11:45.846
Sean O'Connell
still shoots on film.


170
00:11:46.388 --> 00:11:48.390
That results for
me in a man crush.


171
00:11:50.434 --> 00:11:52.019
Hey, you want
to mount these?


172
00:11:52.269 --> 00:11:53.354
Seriously?

173
00:11:53.521 --> 00:11:54.772
Sure.

174
00:12:05.783 --> 00:12:08.619
SEAN: Heard rumblings
LIFE'S done, man.


175
00:12:08.786 --> 00:12:10.079
Wanted to say thanks.

176
00:12:10.454 --> 00:12:14.291
Take a look inside, a gift for
all the years of hard work.


177
00:12:14.792 --> 00:12:16.293
Sorry about the neg roll.

178
00:12:17.127 --> 00:12:18.879
I spilled some blood on it...

179
00:12:19.046 --> 00:12:20.756
while self-stitching
a gun wound to my abdomen...


180
00:12:20.923 --> 00:12:24.134
but number 25 is my best ever.

181
00:12:24.301 --> 00:12:27.137
The quintessence
of life, I think.


182
00:12:27.304 --> 00:12:29.473
I trust you'll get it
where it needs to go...


183
00:12:29.723 --> 00:12:31.308
you always do.

184
00:12:51.745 --> 00:12:52.746
What did you get?

185
00:12:54.999 --> 00:12:56.333
It's a wallet.

186
00:13:03.841 --> 00:13:05.676
With LIFE'S motto on it.

187
00:13:14.143 --> 00:13:15.436
Here you go.

188
00:13:21.859 --> 00:13:23.694
Where's 25?
It's not there.


189
00:13:24.028 --> 00:13:25.029
(LOUD KNOCKING ON DOOR)

190
00:13:26.488 --> 00:13:29.325
Hey, we need negative 25.

191
00:13:29.867 --> 00:13:32.536
Sean O'Connell
sent a telegram.


192
00:13:32.703 --> 00:13:33.704
An actual telegram.

193
00:13:33.871 --> 00:13:35.831
A 100-year-old dude
came in a little hat.


194
00:13:37.207 --> 00:13:38.417
So there's
a floor meeting.


195
00:13:39.376 --> 00:13:41.003
Bring 25.

196
00:13:44.715 --> 00:13:46.884
It's here somewhere.
We'll find it.


197
00:13:47.217 --> 00:13:49.762
Okay, make a contact sheet of
these frames as soon as you can.


198
00:13:49.928 --> 00:13:51.055
And don't say
anything to anyone.


199
00:13:51.138 --> 00:13:52.222
Yeah.

200
00:13:52.556 --> 00:13:56.477
I just wanted to inform you
all reluctantly, that--


201
00:14:02.733 --> 00:14:05.444
I guess, just start back
from the beginning.


202
00:14:05.611 --> 00:14:08.739
Okay. I just wanted to inform
you all reluctantly...


203
00:14:08.906 --> 00:14:12.242
that this month's issue
will be our last.


204
00:14:12.910 --> 00:14:13.994
What?

205
00:14:14.078 --> 00:14:15.079
Yeah. What?

206
00:14:15.788 --> 00:14:17.456
This is some bull!

207
00:14:18.248 --> 00:14:19.291
It's sad...

208
00:14:20.626 --> 00:14:22.586
...news, for sure.

209
00:14:24.254 --> 00:14:26.256
Now, you're all
valued employees.


210
00:14:26.423 --> 00:14:30.052
But as we undergo this
transition to LIFE online...


211
00:14:30.219 --> 00:14:31.762
we wanted to be
candid with you...


212
00:14:31.929 --> 00:14:35.474
that some of you will be
determined non-vital employees...


213
00:14:35.641 --> 00:14:37.309
to the new partnership.

214
00:14:37.476 --> 00:14:39.436
And we'll be deciding
which of those positions...


215
00:14:39.603 --> 00:14:42.981
will be remaining with us over
the course of the next week.


216
00:14:43.148 --> 00:14:47.194
Also, we feel sad about
that, as you can see.


217
00:14:47.611 --> 00:14:48.654
(GROANS)

218
00:14:48.737 --> 00:14:49.738
Now for some good news.

219
00:14:49.905 --> 00:14:51.907
We are very excited--
All right, Don.


220
00:14:52.574 --> 00:14:55.869
Ted Hendricks. Managing
director of the transition.


221
00:14:56.912 --> 00:14:59.415
Never fun,
this stage.


222
00:14:59.748 --> 00:15:03.043
But we do have ahead of us
the privilege of publishing...


223
00:15:03.210 --> 00:15:06.964
what will be the very last
issue of LIFE magazine.


224
00:15:07.464 --> 00:15:10.551
And for the final issue,
we just received a telegram.


225
00:15:10.634 --> 00:15:11.677
Come on.

226
00:15:11.760 --> 00:15:14.054
From Sean O'Connell...

227
00:15:14.221 --> 00:15:16.390
who has never,
I'm told, been willing...


228
00:15:16.557 --> 00:15:18.434
to speak with
the executives here.


229
00:15:18.600 --> 00:15:20.144
Well, he broke
his long silence


230
00:15:20.310 --> 00:15:21.895
and shared his
thoughts with us...


231
00:15:22.062 --> 00:15:24.898
through that old man.

232
00:15:26.817 --> 00:15:28.193
Sean O'Connell.

233
00:15:28.360 --> 00:15:33.115
"I expect full consideration
of negative 25 for cover.


234
00:15:33.407 --> 00:15:34.950
"My most grand.

235
00:15:35.117 --> 00:15:38.454
"The quintessence of life."

236
00:15:39.830 --> 00:15:40.956
What is that?

237
00:15:41.749 --> 00:15:43.584
It means like the
fullest and most rich.


238
00:15:43.751 --> 00:15:46.044
Okay. So our cover will probably
be the most famous ever...


239
00:15:46.211 --> 00:15:49.715
because it really will have the
big quintessence of all time.


240
00:15:49.882 --> 00:15:53.093
Very full and so rich.

241
00:15:55.846 --> 00:15:57.514
So let's see
this thing. Huh?


242
00:15:57.681 --> 00:15:59.016
Let's see it.

243
00:15:59.183 --> 00:16:01.894
Can we-- What am I doing up here?
What's going on?


244
00:16:02.060 --> 00:16:03.520
We'll receive it now
from Negative Assets.


245
00:16:03.687 --> 00:16:04.938
This gentleman.
The last man in.


246
00:16:05.063 --> 00:16:06.273
Negative Assets.
What's that?


247
00:16:06.440 --> 00:16:07.483
Ah, Major Tom.

248
00:16:08.358 --> 00:16:10.736
Can I get that?

249
00:16:13.530 --> 00:16:15.407
It's being processed.

250
00:16:16.283 --> 00:16:17.451
All right. Well,
let's do it.


251
00:16:17.618 --> 00:16:19.995
Let's process
some quintessence.


252
00:16:20.370 --> 00:16:21.371
Come on.

253
00:16:22.206 --> 00:16:23.207
Go.

254
00:16:23.832 --> 00:16:24.833
Now.

255
00:16:24.917 --> 00:16:26.418
That's why I'm clapping.

256
00:16:26.585 --> 00:16:28.545
When do we go to press?
Two and a half weeks.


257
00:16:42.518 --> 00:16:43.519
Hi.

258
00:16:43.977 --> 00:16:44.978
Hi.

259
00:16:45.646 --> 00:16:47.773
I'm Walter.

260
00:16:48.232 --> 00:16:50.359
Cheryl. Melhoff. Mitty.

261
00:16:50.776 --> 00:16:51.819
Yes.

262
00:16:54.238 --> 00:16:56.156
You work in Photo Accounts, right?
I do.


263
00:16:56.323 --> 00:16:57.407
Negative Assets.

264
00:16:57.574 --> 00:16:58.909
Yes. lam.

265
00:16:59.076 --> 00:17:01.912
You're processing the last cover photo.
That's a big deal.


266
00:17:02.079 --> 00:17:04.957
Yeah, it's... there's a...
we have a glitch.


267
00:17:05.123 --> 00:17:06.583
Mini, on that
one right now.


268
00:17:06.750 --> 00:17:08.293
I wanted to say,
to you...


269
00:17:09.086 --> 00:17:13.006
do you maybe have an address
for Sean O'Connell?


270
00:17:14.049 --> 00:17:16.260
Um... It's not really
that easy with him.


271
00:17:16.343 --> 00:17:18.011
He moves around
so much. I don't.


272
00:17:18.178 --> 00:17:19.429
Yeah, he's on a freelance.

273
00:17:19.596 --> 00:17:22.349
I don't know where and
he doesn't have a phone.


274
00:17:22.516 --> 00:17:24.977
No phone? He's old school. Yeah.

275
00:17:28.230 --> 00:17:30.023
But, you know, why don't
I check with Peg?


276
00:17:30.190 --> 00:17:31.984
I know she just processed
a check for him.


277
00:17:32.150 --> 00:17:34.945
And we could track his pay-out maybe.
Find him that way?


278
00:17:35.529 --> 00:17:38.407
Cool. Very cool.
Okay.


279
00:17:38.574 --> 00:17:40.200
Walter.
Yes.


280
00:17:40.367 --> 00:17:41.660
I'm on it.

281
00:17:41.827 --> 00:17:42.995
Thanks.

282
00:17:43.161 --> 00:17:44.246
Yes. Are you coming?

283
00:17:44.496 --> 00:17:45.956
Yes, I'm not.

284
00:17:46.290 --> 00:17:48.208
Yes, I have
to stay.


285
00:17:50.168 --> 00:17:52.671
Here's the
contact sheet.


286
00:17:58.719 --> 00:17:59.928
What do you see?

287
00:18:00.095 --> 00:18:02.222
This photo cluster.
These three.


288
00:18:02.389 --> 00:18:04.099
They're the only
printable ones.


289
00:18:04.266 --> 00:18:06.393
He took them around the
same time he took 25.


290
00:18:06.643 --> 00:18:09.104
They could give us a clue
to where Sean is.


291
00:18:09.271 --> 00:18:10.272
Blow them up,
all right?


292
00:18:10.397 --> 00:18:11.398
Cool.

293
00:18:26.663 --> 00:18:28.332
CHERYL: Hey.

294
00:18:28.665 --> 00:18:30.208
Walter, right?

295
00:18:33.086 --> 00:18:34.171
Yeah.

296
00:18:34.588 --> 00:18:37.424
So, I called Peg about Sean.
She's gonna get back to me.


297
00:18:37.799 --> 00:18:39.176
Oh! Hey, thanks.

298
00:18:40.093 --> 00:18:42.512
Cool glasses,
very Sand People.


299
00:18:43.555 --> 00:18:45.933
These? No,
these are loupes.


300
00:18:46.099 --> 00:18:47.684
They're for work.
They magnify the--


301
00:18:47.851 --> 00:18:49.853
Is that 25? Can I see?

302
00:18:50.020 --> 00:18:51.104
That's... No.

303
00:18:51.897 --> 00:18:54.733
I can't quite
find 25...


304
00:18:54.900 --> 00:18:56.401
just now.

305
00:18:56.568 --> 00:18:58.070
You can't find it?

306
00:18:58.236 --> 00:19:00.030
Yeah. That's why
I'm trying to find Sean.


307
00:19:00.197 --> 00:19:04.368
I'm trying to track him down
somehow with these other images.


308
00:19:05.452 --> 00:19:06.536
His whereabouts?

309
00:19:06.703 --> 00:19:07.871
Yeah.

310
00:19:09.873 --> 00:19:12.376
I take this class,
Writing the Mystery Novel.


311
00:19:13.043 --> 00:19:15.045
Anyway, they say the key
is to work backwards.


312
00:19:15.212 --> 00:19:18.632
You connect the clues and then
scatter them so they seem unrelated.


313
00:19:18.799 --> 00:19:20.550
There's like a whole
science to it.


314
00:19:21.259 --> 00:19:22.719
May I?
Sure.


315
00:19:23.804 --> 00:19:25.889
Okay. Thumb.

316
00:19:26.306 --> 00:19:28.892
Yeah. It's an
unknown thumb.


317
00:19:29.059 --> 00:19:30.978
Okay. Water?

318
00:19:32.312 --> 00:19:33.438
Just water, I guess?

319
00:19:33.605 --> 00:19:34.648
Yeah, just water.

320
00:19:34.773 --> 00:19:35.816
Okay.

321
00:19:35.983 --> 00:19:37.317
And...

322
00:19:38.735 --> 00:19:41.321
like a curved piece of...

323
00:19:41.488 --> 00:19:45.283
some kind of, part of a thing.
(CHUCKLES)


324

But the thing with clues,
my teacher says...


325
00:19:49.746 --> 00:19:52.249
is you really only need one good
one, and then they'll connect...


326
00:19:52.416 --> 00:19:55.168
and you'll be like, "Oh, yes, of
course, unknown thumb, water...


327
00:19:55.335 --> 00:19:57.671
"I should have seen this
the whole time. Ahh!"


328
00:19:58.338 --> 00:20:01.133
(LAUGHS) Yeah, yeah,
I'll be like...


329
00:20:05.262 --> 00:20:09.307
Well, anyway, I should get
back and try not to get fired.

331
00:20:17.649 --> 00:20:19.651

I've been working on, too.

336
00:20:32.497 --> 00:20:34.875
I was just saying I'll let you
know when I hear back from Peg.


337
00:20:35.876 --> 00:20:37.711
Okay. Thank you.

00:20:38.045 --> 00:20:39.129

Hey, Odessa.

341
00:20:49.431 --> 00:20:50.557
What?

342
00:20:59.066 --> 00:21:02.194
WALTER: ls there a larger apartment
available the piano could fit in?


343
00:21:02.444 --> 00:21:04.696
Because We
a memento of our meme.

That's a really big--

345
00:21:07.574 --> 00:21:10.452
Most people sell their really big
mementos before they move here.


346
00:21:10.619 --> 00:21:12.954
My dad bought it for her
the year they were married.


347
00:21:13.121 --> 00:21:15.290
It means a lot to her.

348
00:21:16.374 --> 00:21:18.210
That's a villa. It's a
little more costly...


349
00:21:18.376 --> 00:21:21.838
but it has a more generous, piano kind
of size living room for you though.


350
00:21:22.005 --> 00:21:23.381
Yeah. Yeah,
this is good.


351
00:21:23.590 --> 00:21:24.800
On move-in,
you'd need first month's,

last month's,
and full deposit.


353
00:21:26.259 --> 00:21:28.011
That's $4,700.
Great.


354
00:21:28.345 --> 00:21:29.387
Yeah, okay.

355
00:21:29.471 --> 00:21:30.847
Yeah, we'll take it.
I'll get the paperwork.


356
00:21:30.931 --> 00:21:33.058
The new villa comes
open in three weeks.

I'm guessing.

That's cool.

00:21:43.735 --> 00:21:45.028
Yeah. Isn't
that awesome?


362
00:21:45.195 --> 00:21:47.781
This was your favorite thing when
we were little. Do you remember?


363
00:21:47.948 --> 00:21:49.199
You want to do it?

364
00:21:49.366 --> 00:21:50.367
Yeah, all right.

room for your piano.

You can stay at my place
until it's ready.

I won't be cramping

get you in here today.

Look what I found!

375
00:22:09.553 --> 00:22:11.805
This is from you
and Tim Linderman.


376
00:22:11.972 --> 00:22:14.224
Do you remember, we were
gonna backpack Europe?


377
00:22:14.391 --> 00:22:15.725
That June Dad died?

378
00:22:15.892 --> 00:22:18.103
Man! What is in here?

379
00:22:18.270 --> 00:22:19.437
That's my Walter box.

Some of my Walter
knick-knacks and keepsakes.


381
00:22:22.566 --> 00:22:24.526
You made the
best mix tapes!


382
00:22:24.860 --> 00:22:27.237
Oh, man.
What? What's that?


383
00:22:27.529 --> 00:22:29.573
Travel journal Dad gave me.

384
00:22:29.698 --> 00:22:30.699
Oh.

385
00:22:30.949 --> 00:22:33.702
You should donate that, because
you never used it, to a poor kid.


386
00:22:33.869 --> 00:22:35.871
A poor kid who's
gonna travel to Europe?


387
00:22:36.037 --> 00:22:37.873
Look at you
and your dad!


388
00:22:38.039 --> 00:22:39.082
Is that my
tournament one?


389
00:22:39.249 --> 00:22:41.042

Sharing your accomplishments
with the whole world.


391
00:22:45.922 --> 00:22:47.924
It's from the
Fairview Smalltowner, Mom.


392
00:22:48.091 --> 00:22:50.760
Well, I really
liked that nifty mohawk.


393
00:22:51.261 --> 00:22:52.429
You know, when
your daddy died...


394
00:22:52.596 --> 00:22:54.764
and then you went to work
in that pizza place...


395
00:22:54.931 --> 00:22:58.435
the one that was named after a father,
had that father kind of name.


396
00:22:58.518 --> 00:22:59.519
Papa John's.

397

Yeah, delivery.

it was really sad for you...

working in a restaurant
named after a father

after your father just died.

401
00:23:08.445 --> 00:23:10.030
I never even
thought about that.


402
00:23:11.198 --> 00:23:13.074
Probably because
I didn't call Dad "Papa."


403
00:23:13.241 --> 00:23:14.784
You had a weird style.

404
00:23:14.951 --> 00:23:17.370
That wasn't my style.
That was a uniform. KFC.

00:27:22.449 --> 00:27:23.700
and then his
wife answers it...


480
00:27:23.867 --> 00:27:26.161
and it turns out they were soul
mates and didn't even know it...


481
00:27:26.327 --> 00:27:29.581
and they end up making love
in capes, or on a cape.


482
00:27:29.747 --> 00:27:32.375
It's a song? Can you
sing a little bit?


483
00:27:32.542 --> 00:27:36.045
(SINGING SOFTLY) If you like pina
coladas, getting caught in the rain


484
00:27:36.212 --> 00:27:37.297
You know that song?
I have to go.


485
00:27:37.422 --> 00:27:38.506
Is that Hall & Oates?

486
00:27:38.756 --> 00:27:40.550
Hey!
Hey.


487
00:27:40.717 --> 00:27:41.843
Is that another clue?

488
00:27:42.010 --> 00:27:43.511
Yeah. This one's okay.
Yeah?


489
00:27:44.095 --> 00:27:46.139
There's a boat
there, I think.


490
00:27:46.681 --> 00:27:48.892
"Erkig--"
Snek.


491
00:27:49.058 --> 00:27:50.393
Erkigsnek?
Yeah.


492
00:27:50.560 --> 00:27:51.644
Sounds like a real clue.

493
00:27:51.811 --> 00:27:53.229
Yeah, it's the
boat's name.


494
00:27:53.396 --> 00:27:54.522
Have you Googled it?

495
00:27:54.647 --> 00:27:55.732
I was on my way to.

496
00:27:56.733 --> 00:27:58.151
Yeah. N
-U.

497
00:27:58.318 --> 00:28:01.279
It's the first two letters
of the port city.

(PHONE CHIMES)

500
00:28:06.117 --> 00:28:07.327
So, the park...

501
00:28:07.494 --> 00:28:09.245
I got to run up there
and pick up my son.


502
00:28:09.412 --> 00:28:11.247
He's skateboarding
with a friend.


503
00:28:11.414 --> 00:28:13.625
Do you want to walk
up with me?


504
00:28:15.084 --> 00:28:16.169
Starting now?

505
00:28:16.336 --> 00:28:17.629
Yeah, starting now.

506
00:28:17.795 --> 00:28:18.963
Okay.

507
00:28:19.130 --> 00:28:20.798
Yeah, we got to figure this out.
It's a big deal.


508
00:28:20.965 --> 00:28:22.675
You lost a
Sean O'Connell.


509
00:28:23.593 --> 00:28:25.178
I used to work
at Nabisco.


510
00:28:25.345 --> 00:28:29.641
And then,
I had a change...


511
00:28:29.807 --> 00:28:32.143
and I decided
to apply to LIFE.


512
00:28:32.310 --> 00:28:35.772
Thought it would be more
colorful, less regular, I guess.


513
00:28:35.939 --> 00:28:38.483
You know, I just like
the idea of it.


514
00:28:39.817 --> 00:28:41.319
I like the motto
of the company.


515
00:28:41.486 --> 00:28:42.779
Do you know it?

00:28:48.201 --> 00:28:49.619
Yeah, I...

520
00:28:51.162 --> 00:28:53.122
I got this, from Sean.

521
00:28:54.624 --> 00:28:55.667
He gave this to you?

522
00:28:55.833 --> 00:28:57.001
Yeah.

523
00:28:58.461 --> 00:29:00.463
I like that,
"TO DRAW CLOSER."


524
00:29:03.800 --> 00:29:05.802
So, what's he
like in person?


525
00:29:05.969 --> 00:29:07.136
Sean?
Yeah.


526
00:29:08.304 --> 00:29:10.807
Well, I haven't
actually met him.


527
00:29:10.974 --> 00:29:12.809
I mean, we talk
a lot, but...


528
00:29:12.976 --> 00:29:15.979
I've been his point guy here
ever since I started.

00:29:16.145 --> 00:29:17.647
How long ago was that?

531
00:29:20.316 --> 00:29:21.401
16 years?

532
00:29:21.568 --> 00:29:23.027
Oh, my gosh. Wow.

533
00:29:23.194 --> 00:29:24.487
Well, you have
nothing to worry about.


534
00:29:24.654 --> 00:29:26.155
With the layoffs,
I mean.


535
00:29:26.322 --> 00:29:28.241
I've been here
for a month.

Oh. Sorry.


538
00:29:34.831 --> 00:29:36.708
It's Rich's dad.

539
00:29:37.584 --> 00:29:39.002
It's your--

Newly former.


541
00:29:42.213 --> 00:29:45.049
But we've been sort of...
I don't know.


542
00:29:45.216 --> 00:29:46.676
(CONTINUES RINGING) I
don't need to get it.


543
00:29:50.054 --> 00:29:52.682
So, what kind of skateboard
does your son have?


544
00:29:53.725 --> 00:29:55.393
Um, I have
no idea!


545
00:29:55.727 --> 00:29:57.687
It's oblong.
I don't know.


546
00:29:57.854 --> 00:30:00.189
Why?
No, I just--


547
00:30:00.773 --> 00:30:04.694
I used to... I was kind
of into the scene.


548
00:30:05.528 --> 00:30:06.863
The skateboard scene?
Yeah.


549
00:30:07.155 --> 00:30:08.197
Wow!

550
00:30:08.906 --> 00:30:10.241
Hi, Peg.

551
00:30:10.408 --> 00:30:13.536
Yeah, it's Sean O'Connell, we
actually need to find him.


552
00:30:16.039 --> 00:30:18.207
Yes. If you
could hurry.

554
00:30:20.209 --> 00:30:21.461
Yeah.

555
00:30:21.878 --> 00:30:23.630
It's a good one
for the repertoire.


556

I'm Walter.

Rich.

558
00:30:27.467 --> 00:30:29.927
Yeah, we think he might know
something or have an asset we need.


559
00:30:30.094 --> 00:30:31.596
You know, you just got to get
a little more snap...


560
00:30:31.763 --> 00:30:33.222
get that thing up there.

561
00:30:34.390 --> 00:30:36.142
Want me to show
you something?


562
00:30:36.768 --> 00:30:38.394
Sure.

563
00:30:40.438 --> 00:30:41.439
Here.

564
00:30:42.565 --> 00:30:43.608
I like your trucks.

565
00:30:43.900 --> 00:30:44.984
Thanks.

566
00:30:46.319 --> 00:30:47.737
Now check this out.

567
00:30:49.739 --> 00:30:51.491
Know about the flick?
Uh-huh.


568
00:30:51.908 --> 00:30:55.078
Yeah, we've finished processing
his April work order.


569
00:31:01.793 --> 00:31:03.753
Yes, it's kind
of important.


570
00:31:06.589 --> 00:31:09.550
Did you forward
the job 1090s?


571
00:31:10.218 --> 00:31:11.886
Or his last salary?

572
00:31:13.096 --> 00:31:14.263
Wow!

573
00:31:18.101 --> 00:31:19.227

That was awesome.

00:31:21.229 --> 00:31:22.271
So it could be
either place.

Thanks, Walter.
Okay. Thanks, Peg.


577
00:31:24.232 --> 00:31:25.233
All right.

00:31:26.609 --> 00:31:27.777
Hey, so...

579
00:31:27.944 --> 00:31:29.612
Sean's definitely
not in New York.


580
00:31:29.779 --> 00:31:31.322
Peg said she
sent multiples.


581
00:31:31.489 --> 00:31:33.491
I don't know if you know
how it works with him.


582
00:31:33.658 --> 00:31:36.494
She sends copies because we
never know where he's gonna be.


583
00:31:36.661 --> 00:31:39.747
And this week she sent 1090s
to Princeton, New Jersey.


584
00:31:39.997 --> 00:31:41.916
Oh, great.
Train ride.


585
00:31:42.166 --> 00:31:43.626
And one to Greenland.

586
00:31:43.793 --> 00:31:44.794
Just in case.

587
00:31:45.628 --> 00:31:47.296
Greenland, the country?

588
00:31:48.339 --> 00:31:49.424
That's--

589
00:31:50.758 --> 00:31:52.135
You can't take
a train there.


590
00:31:52.343 --> 00:31:53.511
No.

591
00:31:53.678 --> 00:31:55.513
Well, maybe he's in Jersey.
Yeah.


592
00:31:55.680 --> 00:31:58.474
Yeah, is your phone done
buffering with that ship's name?


593
00:31:58.641 --> 00:32:00.685
Yes! Look.
Here it is.

follow that up.


598

Yeah, follow it
up in Greenland.

00:32:12.155 --> 00:32:14.323
Yeah. Why not? Go!

600
00:32:14.490 --> 00:32:15.992

Maybe I should get it.

so fast! Here!


607
00:32:30.173 --> 00:32:31.340
Take that.

608
00:32:33.217 --> 00:32:35.011
Yeah. I understand.

Okay. Bye.

00:32:38.389 --> 00:32:39.974
He did fall
down a well.

00:32:40.683 --> 00:32:42.059
But I don't care.

612
00:32:42.226 --> 00:32:44.645
I just want to be
with you, you know?


613
00:32:44.896 --> 00:32:45.897
Really?

every moment count, starting now.

Anything.

but smaller.

Or something.

don't really know how it works.

00:34:09.230 --> 00:34:10.731
(RASPING)

640
00:34:10.815 --> 00:34:12.942
Good-bye, Walter.

641
00:34:13.484 --> 00:34:14.902
Good-bye! Walter!

642
00:34:15.820 --> 00:34:17.947
Walter!
Walter!


643
00:34:18.114 --> 00:34:19.282
Bye!
Oh!


644
00:34:19.448 --> 00:34:20.783
Sorry! I was just--

645
00:34:21.158 --> 00:34:22.910
Where do you go?

646
00:34:23.077 --> 00:34:24.954
I started thinking about--

647
00:34:25.121 --> 00:34:27.790
No, it's okay, I was probably boring
you about my broken refrigerator.


648
00:34:27.957 --> 00:34:28.958
No!

649
00:34:29.625 --> 00:34:30.585
Rich!

650
00:34:30.668 --> 00:34:33.004
My son's running into the street.
I have to go.


651
00:34:33.170 --> 00:34:34.630
Yeah.

652
00:34:34.797 --> 00:34:38.009
I wanted to tell you,
that song, "Major Tom"?


653
00:34:38.175 --> 00:34:40.845
Back there, when
the beard guy was--


654
00:34:41.762 --> 00:34:42.972
He doesn't know what
he's talking about.


655
00:34:43.139 --> 00:34:47.184
That song is about courage
and going into the unknown.


656
00:34:47.977 --> 00:34:49.270
It's a cool song.

657
00:34:53.190 --> 00:34:54.692
Rich!

658
00:35:04.827 --> 00:35:05.828
Yo!

659
00:35:06.662 --> 00:35:08.789
Where's my thing?

660
00:35:08.998 --> 00:35:11.167
It's in a silver bath.

661
00:35:12.376 --> 00:35:14.337
I don't even know what language
you're speaking right now.


662
00:35:14.503 --> 00:35:16.297
You know, you got
to take me seriously.


663
00:35:16.464 --> 00:35:18.507
I got a magazine
to execute here.


664
00:35:18.674 --> 00:35:20.509
And bosses to answer to.

665
00:35:20.676 --> 00:35:23.638
So next time I see you,
I see that picture. Okay?


666
00:35:25.056 --> 00:35:26.349
Hey! Dream Machine!

667
00:35:26.515 --> 00:35:27.516
Hello?

668
00:35:28.517 --> 00:35:30.353
I want proof
you heard me.


669
00:35:32.146 --> 00:35:33.856
Next time I see you--

670
00:35:35.399 --> 00:35:36.484
You see the picture.

671
00:35:37.068 --> 00:35:38.861
That's right!

672
00:35:45.368 --> 00:35:47.370
Any luck, Hernando?

673
00:35:47.536 --> 00:35:50.164
I turned the place upside-down.

674
00:35:50.331 --> 00:35:51.749
I searched Receiving,
too, man.


675
00:35:53.209 --> 00:35:55.211
This never happens!

676
00:35:55.711 --> 00:35:57.171
I'm telling you...

677
00:35:57.338 --> 00:35:58.589
it's nowhere, Walter.

678
00:36:00.549 --> 00:36:03.719
I mean, maybe he
didn't even send it.


679
00:36:04.345 --> 00:36:05.930
Maybe it's still on him.

680
00:36:07.848 --> 00:36:09.058
Walter?

681
00:36:35.459 --> 00:36:36.919
Walter!

682
00:37:06.824 --> 00:37:11.454
Something filled up

683
00:37:13.956 --> 00:37:18.961
My heart with nothing

684
00:37:21.005 --> 00:37:27.803
Someone told me not to cry

685
00:37:34.560 --> 00:37:39.023
Now that I'm older

686
00:37:41.817 --> 00:37:46.197
My heart's colder

687
00:37:48.491 --> 00:37:55.206
And I can see that it's a lie

688
00:38:35.788 --> 00:38:36.789
Hi.

689
00:38:37.206 --> 00:38:38.207
Hi.

690
00:38:39.542 --> 00:38:41.043
Do you have any
cars available?


691
00:38:42.086 --> 00:38:45.881
Yeah, we have a blue one
and a red one.


692
00:38:50.094 --> 00:38:51.846
I'll take the red one.

693
00:39:35.639 --> 00:39:40.769
MAN: (SINGING) You were working
as a waitress In a cocktail bar


694
00:39:40.936 --> 00:39:43.939
When I met you

695
00:39:44.106 --> 00:39:48.319
I picked you out, I shook you
up And turned you around


696
00:39:48.485 --> 00:39:51.655
Turned you into someone new

697
00:39:52.323 --> 00:39:53.824
Hi.
Hi.


698
00:39:53.991 --> 00:39:58.120
Can I ask you, could
someone receive mail here?


699
00:39:58.287 --> 00:40:00.414
An American?
Sean O'Connell?


700
00:40:00.581 --> 00:40:03.292
I think he might have received
mail at this address.


701
00:40:03.834 --> 00:40:05.920
You want a drink?

702
00:40:06.754 --> 00:40:08.339
Okay. Yeah, I guess...

703
00:40:10.341 --> 00:40:13.260
a small beer shoe.

704
00:40:13.677 --> 00:40:15.638
So, could somebody
get mail here?


705
00:40:15.888 --> 00:40:16.889
Heli mail.

706
00:40:17.014 --> 00:40:18.015
"Heli mail"?

707
00:40:18.349 --> 00:40:21.477
We helicopter mail to the
ships when they pass by.


708
00:40:21.644 --> 00:40:23.771
We are pub and helipad.

709
00:40:23.979 --> 00:40:26.398
Yeah. Wait,
the Erkigsnek?


710
00:40:26.565 --> 00:40:27.983
Yeah. Erkigsnek.

711
00:40:28.150 --> 00:40:29.276
Erkigsnek.

712
00:40:29.652 --> 00:40:31.820
We flew mail
to her Tuesday.


713
00:40:32.154 --> 00:40:34.657
I'm gonna take it
down a little, here.


714
00:40:34.823 --> 00:40:36.659
I just want to
speak from the heart.


715
00:40:36.992 --> 00:40:38.661
I lost a good lady.

716
00:40:39.161 --> 00:40:42.122
I feel this song is helping me
feel like I'm not alone.


717
00:40:42.957 --> 00:40:46.085
Even though
I pretty much am.


718
00:40:46.418 --> 00:40:47.419
Come on, let's sing it.

719
00:40:47.795 --> 00:40:49.171
Everyone.

720
00:40:49.421 --> 00:40:50.589
Let's sing it together.

721
00:40:50.756 --> 00:40:52.925
Don't you want me, baby?

722
00:40:53.092 --> 00:40:55.010
Do you know who
flies the mail out?


723
00:40:55.177 --> 00:40:57.096
Do you have
regular pilots?


724
00:40:57.179 --> 00:40:58.180
Hey, man.

725
00:40:58.264 --> 00:40:59.974
Just keep it going, man.

726
00:41:00.140 --> 00:41:01.392
Hey.
Sing it.


727
00:41:01.558 --> 00:41:03.936
No, no, thank you.
I'm all right.


728
00:41:04.103 --> 00:41:05.562
Come on, man. Go on.

729
00:41:05.729 --> 00:41:07.564
I was working
as a waitress


730
00:41:07.731 --> 00:41:10.442
Yeah, I know it.
I'm okay. Thank you.


731
00:41:10.609 --> 00:41:12.653
I'm on a business trip,
I'm working.


732
00:41:12.820 --> 00:41:14.780
Come on, man. This song
is important to me.


733
00:41:16.031 --> 00:41:16.991
Yeah.
Yeah.


734
00:41:17.074 --> 00:41:18.117
Sing it.
Okay.


735
00:41:18.284 --> 00:41:22.997
I was working as a waitress in a
cocktail bar That much is true


736
00:41:23.080 --> 00:41:24.081
Okay?

737
00:41:24.581 --> 00:41:26.000
That sucked.

738
00:41:26.083 --> 00:41:27.126
Do your work.

739
00:41:27.209 --> 00:41:28.210
You don't have to push.

740
00:41:29.253 --> 00:41:31.171
What if I poke you?
Don't poke me.


741
00:41:31.964 --> 00:41:33.340
Do your work, man.
Don't poke me!


742
00:41:33.507 --> 00:41:35.009
I'm poking you.
What am I doing?


743
00:41:35.175 --> 00:41:37.052
Stop poking me!
Don't poke me!


744
00:41:37.886 --> 00:41:38.887
(YELLS)

745
00:41:40.723 --> 00:41:41.765
Hey!

746
00:41:43.934 --> 00:41:45.019
Come on!

747
00:41:45.561 --> 00:41:46.562
Aah!

748
00:41:50.482 --> 00:41:51.900
Wait, wait.
Wait!


749
00:41:52.443 --> 00:41:54.403
Your thumb! I have to talk
to you about your thumb!


750
00:41:58.991 --> 00:42:02.328
MAN: Yeah. I flew mail out
to the Erkigsnek Tuesday.


751
00:42:02.703 --> 00:42:04.913
Gave him a ride.

752
00:42:05.080 --> 00:42:08.208
He took that photo
of my hand on the stick.


753
00:42:09.293 --> 00:42:13.255
I'm just blown away
I located your thumb.


754
00:42:14.923 --> 00:42:17.426
There is, like, eight
people in Greenland.


755
00:42:20.137 --> 00:42:23.432
I mean, it's a good
place to find a thumb.


756
00:42:26.185 --> 00:42:28.771
Don't cheat on
your lady, man...


757
00:42:28.937 --> 00:42:31.940
when you live in a country that
only has eight people in it.


758
00:42:32.483 --> 00:42:33.859
By the way.

759
00:42:34.735 --> 00:42:35.736
So, uh...

760
00:42:35.819 --> 00:42:38.280
You're scrappy.

761
00:42:38.614 --> 00:42:39.615
(LAUGHS)

762
00:42:40.115 --> 00:42:42.951
You're a little
scrappy Duncan.


763
00:42:43.786 --> 00:42:45.454
So, you're trying
to find this guy?


764
00:42:45.621 --> 00:42:47.039
Yes. Yeah.

765
00:42:47.623 --> 00:42:51.043
Well, I'm flying some radio parts
out there in five minutes.


766
00:42:53.796 --> 00:42:56.298
He may still be
on the boat.


767
00:42:56.840 --> 00:42:57.841
Really?
Yeah.


768
00:42:59.176 --> 00:43:01.929
Maybe you could
come with me.


769
00:43:08.477 --> 00:43:13.649
Yeah, or maybe I could just
call him on the boat phone.


770
00:43:14.650 --> 00:43:16.276
The boat phone?

771
00:43:16.443 --> 00:43:18.612
Yeah, the phone
on the boat.


772
00:43:18.779 --> 00:43:21.490
You mean the
ship-to-shore?


773
00:43:21.657 --> 00:43:25.160
Yeah, maybe I could just ask
him on the ship-to-shore.


774
00:43:25.369 --> 00:43:27.496
Their radio is broke.

775
00:43:27.663 --> 00:43:30.499
That's why I'm
flying out there now.


776
00:43:30.958 --> 00:43:31.959
Oh.

777
00:43:32.376 --> 00:43:34.169
You're flying
out right now?


778
00:43:34.503 --> 00:43:35.796
I'm just gonna
finish my beer.


779
00:43:35.963 --> 00:43:37.339
The weather doesn't
look so great.


780
00:43:37.506 --> 00:43:38.507
It's not.

781
00:43:39.174 --> 00:43:40.509
Looks like there's
a storm moving in.


782
00:43:42.010 --> 00:43:43.011
PILOT: Yeah.

783
00:43:43.178 --> 00:43:44.388
A-brewin'.

784
00:43:44.555 --> 00:43:46.098
Yeah.

785
00:43:46.265 --> 00:43:47.349
But you're just...

786
00:43:47.516 --> 00:43:49.768
you're just gonna
finish your beer...


787
00:43:49.935 --> 00:43:53.147
and then fly a machine?

788
00:43:55.858 --> 00:43:57.317
Yeah.

789
00:43:58.444 --> 00:44:00.696
I'm kind of nervous
about the storm.


790
00:44:01.822 --> 00:44:04.825
I just want to get
a couple of beers down.


791
00:44:15.169 --> 00:44:16.378
Okay. I'm not gonna
go with you.

(BURPS)

793
00:44:18.213 --> 00:44:19.339
Yeah.

794
00:44:21.049 --> 00:44:22.551
Whatever.

795
00:44:27.306 --> 00:44:28.724
See you, man.
Okay.


796
00:44:28.891 --> 00:44:29.975
See you.

797
00:44:31.935 --> 00:44:33.395
Okay.

We don't!

I was gonna drop the radio

You take them.
They're right next to you.

These?
Yeah.


844

Just jump in the boat.
You got them?


845

great, Walter!

What do you mean,
"jump into the boat"?


848
00:49:20.849 --> 00:49:24.060
What would be the best way of
reaching you to stay in touch?


849
00:49:25.187 --> 00:49:26.521
I don't know. Wait!

What do you mean
"jump into the boat"?

got to go now!

No, Walter!

You are safe!

here, I think!

Don't fear the porpoise!

870
00:50:30.418 --> 00:50:32.796
I don't think
it's a porpoise!


871
00:50:32.963 --> 00:50:35.590
I'm telling you,
it's a porpoise.

900
00:51:49.998 --> 00:51:51.333
Is there any way
that we could radio him?

It's very important that I
discuss something with him.

about where he was going?

No, he didn't say much.

these guys, the Chilean deckhands.

01:07:50.291 --> 01:07:53.460
No, I just worked there,
that's all.


1130
01:07:54.837 --> 01:07:57.131
I used to have a mohawk...

1131
01:07:57.631 --> 01:07:59.341
and a backpack...

1132
01:08:00.134 --> 01:08:04.638
and this idea of who I wanted
to be and what I wanted to do.


1133
01:08:06.932 --> 01:08:08.183
Yeah?

1134
01:08:08.350 --> 01:08:10.311
Nothing. Just...

1135
01:08:12.187 --> 01:08:14.815
I was pretty
close with my dad.


1136
01:08:14.982 --> 01:08:19.820
And he died when I
was 17, on a Tuesday.


1137
01:08:19.987 --> 01:08:21.947
And we didn't
have any savings.


1138
01:08:22.489 --> 01:08:25.868
So I got a haircut
that Thursday...


1139
01:08:26.035 --> 01:08:29.455
and a job the same Thursday.

1140
01:08:30.873 --> 01:08:32.166
Papa John's?

1141
01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:34.168
Yeah.

1142
01:08:36.921 --> 01:08:38.923
Your dad let
you have a mohawk?


1143
01:08:39.673 --> 01:08:41.926
He shaved my head.

1144
01:08:42.593 --> 01:08:44.678
That's a good dad move.

1145
01:08:45.512 --> 01:08:46.889
Yeah.

1146
01:08:48.724 --> 01:08:50.059
Is it nice there?

1147
01:08:50.768 --> 01:08:53.187
Yeah, it is.

1148
01:08:53.854 --> 01:08:55.606
It's really beautiful.

1149
01:08:56.065 --> 01:08:57.399
Well, it's pretty
sucky here.


1150
01:08:57.566 --> 01:08:58.776
Human Resources
has already started


1151
01:08:58.901 --> 01:09:00.110
letting some of
the staff go...


1152
01:09:00.277 --> 01:09:02.571
so it'll be a lot different
when you get back.


1153
01:09:03.697 --> 01:09:05.699
Hey, I picked
something up for...


1154
01:09:08.077 --> 01:09:09.411
I think I lost you.

1155
01:09:11.372 --> 01:09:13.582
You know what? I'll catch
you up when I see you.


1156
01:09:14.375 --> 01:09:15.459
Great. Okay.

1157
01:09:15.626 --> 01:09:17.711
All right. Okay.

1158
01:09:18.253 --> 01:09:19.380
Bye, Walter.

1159
01:09:19.546 --> 01:09:20.965
Bye, Cheryl.

1160
01:09:32.059 --> 01:09:33.060
(PHONE CHIMING)

1161
01:10:02.798 --> 01:10:03.799
What's going on?

1162
01:10:05.592 --> 01:10:07.344
They shut down
two floors.


1163
01:10:07.511 --> 01:10:10.264
Why do you
look rugged?


1164
01:10:12.975 --> 01:10:14.184
I see you.

1165
01:10:15.144 --> 01:10:16.812
I see you!

1166
01:10:16.979 --> 01:10:18.105
What did I say?

1167
01:10:18.272 --> 01:10:19.690
I see you.

1168
01:10:19.940 --> 01:10:21.692
The photograph.
Now. Let me see it.


1169
01:10:21.859 --> 01:10:24.319
He looked it up. There's no
such thing as a silver bath.


1170
01:10:24.945 --> 01:10:27.781
Listen, there was uncertainty
about the negative.


1171
01:10:27.948 --> 01:10:29.700
I understood that, hopefully,
it was in Iceland.


1172
01:10:29.950 --> 01:10:31.118
It was in your care.

1173
01:10:31.201 --> 01:10:32.202
If you just give
me some more time--


1174
01:10:32.369 --> 01:10:33.370
You're fired.

1175
01:10:33.454 --> 01:10:34.788
We'll make another cover.

1176
01:10:34.872 --> 01:10:35.873
Hey!

1177
01:10:39.293 --> 01:10:42.004
More than a million, way more,
negatives have come through my office.


1178
01:10:42.171 --> 01:10:43.672
I have never mislaid one.

1179
01:10:44.298 --> 01:10:47.593
Put it on a plaque.
Hang it at your next job.


1180
01:10:48.635 --> 01:10:50.637
Now I got to explain
this to the board?


1181
01:10:53.140 --> 01:10:54.475
Hey.

1182
01:10:56.101 --> 01:10:57.269
Are you okay?

1183
01:10:57.352 --> 01:10:58.812
Yeah.

1184
01:10:59.480 --> 01:11:00.981
That's cool.

1185
01:11:01.148 --> 01:11:04.485
It's a skateboard.
It's for Cheryl's son.


1186
01:11:06.111 --> 01:11:08.113
Cheryl's not in.
She was let go.


1187
01:11:08.822 --> 01:11:10.699
I told you,
man, it's bad.


1188
01:11:10.866 --> 01:11:12.284
Hey! That's my fern.

1189
01:11:13.494 --> 01:11:14.995
Thank you.

1190
01:12:06.088 --> 01:12:07.089
Hi.

1191
01:12:07.756 --> 01:12:08.882
Hi.

1192
01:12:11.426 --> 01:12:12.761
Can I...?

1193
01:12:14.805 --> 01:12:16.181
Yeah.

1194
01:12:16.932 --> 01:12:19.393
I'm looking for
Cheryl Melhoff.


1195
01:12:20.018 --> 01:12:21.019
You want Cheryl?

1196
01:12:21.687 --> 01:12:23.981
Yeah. She's...

1197
01:12:24.731 --> 01:12:29.945
We work together, and she was
helping me with a work thing.


1198
01:12:32.281 --> 01:12:33.782
Cheryl.

1199
01:12:35.784 --> 01:12:37.202
Honey?

1200
01:12:39.037 --> 01:12:40.497
There's some guy here.

1201
01:12:40.664 --> 01:12:42.291
CHERYL: What?

1202
01:12:42.958 --> 01:12:43.959
(BARKING)

1203
01:12:44.293 --> 01:12:45.419
MAN: From work.

1204
01:12:46.044 --> 01:12:48.463
CHERYL: Okay, hold on.
I'm on the phone.

(AUDIENCE CHEERING)

1206
01:13:13.322 --> 01:13:14.615
MAN". It's Conan.

1207
01:13:14.781 --> 01:13:19.620
Tonight, First Lady Michelle
Obama, Walter Mitty.


1208
01:13:19.786 --> 01:13:21.622
Can we talk
about your love life?


1209
01:13:21.955 --> 01:13:23.332
I think people
would be interested.


1210
01:13:23.498 --> 01:13:24.833
You don't want to know
about my love life.


1211
01:13:25.459 --> 01:13:26.627
I think they do.

1212
01:13:26.877 --> 01:13:30.505
Yeah, I think they do. Now, I
don't believe everything I read.


1213
01:13:30.672 --> 01:13:33.383
There's a scandal?
A little scandal?


1214
01:13:33.550 --> 01:13:35.552
A little scandal, yes.

1215
01:13:35.719 --> 01:13:39.306
She was back with her
husband, or something.


1216
01:13:39.473 --> 01:13:40.432
Then she fell for you?

1217
01:13:40.515 --> 01:13:42.643
Where there's smoke,
there's fire.


1218
01:13:42.809 --> 01:13:43.977
You're awesome, Walter.

1219
01:13:44.144 --> 01:13:45.145
WALTER: (ON TV) Thanks.

1220
01:13:45.229 --> 01:13:46.313
ANDY: Sure.

1221
01:13:46.688 --> 01:13:48.190
Can you turn this off?

1222
01:13:49.233 --> 01:13:50.275
It stays on.

1223
01:13:53.570 --> 01:13:55.822
I'm just going to get out.

1224
01:14:10.254 --> 01:14:11.296
Hey, Mom.

1225
01:14:11.421 --> 01:14:12.422
Hi, honey.

1226
01:14:13.423 --> 01:14:15.342
Walter, you got
to tip these guys.


1227
01:14:15.509 --> 01:14:17.511
We got the piano
back safe, Mom.


1228
01:14:18.512 --> 01:14:20.555
Are you back
from your work trip?


1229
01:14:20.722 --> 01:14:22.266
Yeah, this morning.

1230
01:14:22.516 --> 01:14:23.684
Hungry?

1231
01:14:24.142 --> 01:14:25.143
Mmm-hmm.

1232
01:14:25.686 --> 01:14:27.187
I'm making soup.
Thanks.


1233
01:14:27.354 --> 01:14:28.939
Hey, tipping time now.

1234
01:14:34.861 --> 01:14:36.405
This is all I got.

1235
01:14:38.991 --> 01:14:40.450
MAN: Thank you.
Thank you very much.


1236
01:14:40.617 --> 01:14:42.452
ODESSA: All right,
thanks, everybody.


1237
01:14:42.619 --> 01:14:43.954
For all your
hard work.


1238
01:14:44.121 --> 01:14:45.289
MAN: We appreciate
it, ma'am.


1239
01:14:45.455 --> 01:14:47.165
You did great. You
just let yourself out.


1240
01:14:47.332 --> 01:14:48.792
He's good for this.

1241
01:14:51.295 --> 01:14:52.838
EDNA: Are you gonna
stay for dinner?


1242
01:14:53.005 --> 01:14:54.131
ODESSA: Oh, Mom,
I'd love to.


1243
01:14:54.298 --> 01:14:55.799
I think I'm just
really wiped out


1244
01:14:55.924 --> 01:14:57.384
after supervising moving
that thing all day.


1245
01:14:57.551 --> 01:15:00.429
I think I just need to go to
yoga and then just crash.


1246
01:15:00.595 --> 01:15:02.097
What is it?
A class?


1247
01:15:02.514 --> 01:15:03.515
Yes, yoga.

1248
01:15:03.682 --> 01:15:06.435
It's a class. I go to the hot
kind, where they heat the room.


1249
01:15:07.227 --> 01:15:08.687
Have you heard of that? Sure.

1250
01:15:08.854 --> 01:15:10.814
You have?
It's great for you.


1251
01:15:10.981 --> 01:15:12.441
You just get it all
out of your system.


1252
01:15:12.607 --> 01:15:15.110
You get your sweat out, you just
get everything, all your fear.


1253
01:15:15.277 --> 01:15:17.362
I'm waiting on a call
about an audition.


1254
01:15:17.529 --> 01:15:18.780
That Grease show'?

1255
01:15:18.947 --> 01:15:20.240
Yeah.
Rizzo?


1256
01:15:20.407 --> 01:15:22.451
Yeah. I'm really
excited about it.


1257
01:15:23.452 --> 01:15:25.203
What's good about this is that
I just don't worry about it.


1258
01:15:25.662 --> 01:15:26.913
I just get
out of my head.


1259
01:15:27.080 --> 01:15:28.081
Is that good for you?

1260
01:15:28.165 --> 01:15:30.375
I feel like it's good
in a class like this.


1261
01:15:30.542 --> 01:15:32.127
I mean, I'm not going to get
paid for it, which is fine.


1262
01:15:32.294 --> 01:15:33.837
It's not about money.
Wonderful.


1263
01:15:34.004 --> 01:15:35.589
And I feel like...

1264
01:15:35.756 --> 01:15:39.718
It's just for kids, but I think it's
important for them to start early.


1265
01:15:40.218 --> 01:15:41.470
I'm really
thrilled, Mom.


1266
01:15:41.636 --> 01:15:43.597
I think I'm just
going to enjoy it.


1267
01:15:43.722 --> 01:15:45.599
Just standing in front
of people and talking.


1268
01:15:46.099 --> 01:15:48.018
You'll be good at that.
Yeah.


1269
01:15:48.185 --> 01:15:50.062
You'll really be good at that.
I think so, too, Mom.


1270
01:15:50.228 --> 01:15:51.521
Hey, Mom?

1271
01:15:51.688 --> 01:15:52.856
Yeah.

1272
01:15:53.482 --> 01:15:57.903
Did somebody take a picture of
your piano, like, a week ago?


1273
01:16:00.238 --> 01:16:01.490
I did.

1274
01:16:02.282 --> 01:16:04.117
With Sean's camera.

1275
01:16:08.246 --> 01:16:09.456
Sean O'Connell's camera?

1276
01:16:09.623 --> 01:16:11.458
Yeah, he came to visit.

1277
01:16:12.584 --> 01:16:13.960
Mom, what?

1278
01:16:15.045 --> 01:16:16.046
Yeah.

1279
01:16:16.129 --> 01:16:18.006
He wanted to know
about your work schedule,


1280
01:16:18.131 --> 01:16:20.092
when you left,
when you came home.


1281
01:16:20.258 --> 01:16:22.636
He said you
really understood LIFE.


1282
01:16:22.803 --> 01:16:24.554
He was really
interested in your work.


1283
01:16:26.807 --> 01:16:28.266
Mom, why didn't you tell me?

1284
01:16:28.475 --> 01:16:30.977
I told you. I told you
in the produce aisle.


1285
01:16:31.144 --> 01:16:32.687
I remember that.

1286
01:16:34.314 --> 01:16:35.357
Maybe you were...

1287
01:16:35.524 --> 01:16:39.236
Odessa, what is it you call it when he
goes into one of his little places?


1288
01:16:39.403 --> 01:16:41.029
"Zoned out."

1289
01:16:41.196 --> 01:16:43.115
You do that
now and then.


1290
01:16:44.950 --> 01:16:46.660
What's the matter?

1291
01:16:48.120 --> 01:16:49.913
I got fired.

1292
01:16:50.455 --> 01:16:52.165
I lost a picture of his.

1293
01:16:52.958 --> 01:16:53.959
Can you find it?

1294
01:16:55.168 --> 01:16:57.295
No, I don't know
where he is.


1295
01:16:57.462 --> 01:17:00.549
He's someplace
with Warlocks or...


1296
01:17:01.466 --> 01:17:03.093
Warlords.

1297
01:17:03.343 --> 01:17:04.803
No, Warlocks.

1298
01:17:05.220 --> 01:17:06.805
No. Warlords.

1299
01:17:06.972 --> 01:17:10.308
Sean said he had to meet
with warlords very soon...


1300
01:17:10.475 --> 01:17:12.477
and maybe he
would take my cake


1301
01:17:12.602 --> 01:17:14.604
so that he could
get permission...


1302
01:17:14.771 --> 01:17:17.190
to trek through
the wilds and places.


1303
01:17:17.357 --> 01:17:20.193
He said he wants to photograph
snow leopards. How about that?


1304
01:17:20.360 --> 01:17:21.778
Who?

1305
01:17:31.163 --> 01:17:33.790
"Ungoverned Afghanistan."

1306
01:17:36.751 --> 01:17:37.794
EDNA: Mmm-hmm.

1307
01:17:37.878 --> 01:17:38.879
That's where Sean is.

1308
01:17:39.588 --> 01:17:42.090
Crazy Afghanistan. Yeah.

1309
01:17:42.757 --> 01:17:44.843
In the upper Himalayas.

1310
01:17:45.760 --> 01:17:47.512
They can't
let you go.


1311
01:17:48.513 --> 01:17:50.599
You were Sean's partner.

1312
01:17:50.765 --> 01:17:51.933
He told me...

1313
01:17:52.100 --> 01:17:54.561
that you were the person
who worked the hardest...


1314
01:17:54.728 --> 01:17:59.191
to make sure his work was
realized the way he wished.


1315
01:18:04.404 --> 01:18:06.114
You finish his work.

1316
01:18:49.991 --> 01:18:52.202
Heaven is a switchboard
that you want to fight


1317
01:18:52.285 --> 01:18:54.538
She would even miss you
if you taught her sight


1318
01:18:54.621 --> 01:18:56.748
Power politician leaning
to the right


1319
01:18:56.831 --> 01:18:58.041
Baby's got a trust fund

1320
01:18:58.124 --> 01:19:01.044
That she'll want to
go off like that


1321
01:19:01.127 --> 01:19:03.129
Get off of my stack

1322
01:19:03.755 --> 01:19:05.423
Leave a little window

1323
01:19:05.507 --> 01:19:07.592
Get off of my stack

1324
01:19:15.809 --> 01:19:17.936
Now we wear same-colored
yellow uniforms


1325
01:19:18.019 --> 01:19:20.605
Sky is burning but at
least we know we're warm


1326
01:19:20.689 --> 01:19:22.732
Go and run yourself
a million miles


1327
01:19:22.816 --> 01:19:24.192
Hoping that the colors run out

1328
01:19:24.317 --> 01:19:26.528
And you go off like that

1329
01:19:26.903 --> 01:19:28.989
Get off of my stack

1330
01:19:32.200 --> 01:19:34.869
Stack

1331
01:21:43.665 --> 01:21:44.666
(PHONE RINGS)

1332
01:21:47.293 --> 01:21:48.336
Hey,Todd.

1333
01:21:48.461 --> 01:21:50.130
Hey, what's up?

1334
01:21:50.296 --> 01:21:51.631
Not much.

1335
01:21:51.798 --> 01:21:55.427
Hey, good news. Your profile
really rounded out, man.


1336
01:21:55.593 --> 01:21:57.345
That volcano-shark combo.

1337
01:21:57.512 --> 01:22:00.473
That is money in the bank. Get
ready to get a lot of winks.


1338
01:22:00.640 --> 01:22:01.808
Okay.

1339
01:22:01.975 --> 01:22:03.309
But something else.

1340
01:22:03.476 --> 01:22:05.311
Cheryl Melhoff...

1341
01:22:05.478 --> 01:22:08.022
she's not on here
anymore. Withdrawn.


1342
01:22:08.523 --> 01:22:09.524
Oh.

1343
01:22:09.691 --> 01:22:11.443
Really?
Yeah.


1344
01:22:11.985 --> 01:22:13.445
Hey, man, where
are you now?


1345
01:22:13.611 --> 01:22:14.821
Himalayas.

1346
01:22:14.988 --> 01:22:18.158
The Himalayas.
I love it.


1347
01:22:18.324 --> 01:22:19.826
That is a kick-ass
"Been There."


1348
01:22:19.993 --> 01:22:21.995
Todd, I'm gonna
keep this short.


1349
01:22:22.162 --> 01:22:23.830
I have to make
oxygen choices.


1350
01:22:23.997 --> 01:22:26.207
Hey, I get it. so!

1351
01:22:26.374 --> 01:22:29.544
Anyway, you have a profile now.
Congratulations.


1352
01:22:29.711 --> 01:22:31.504
Cool, but,
you know what?


1353
01:22:31.671 --> 01:22:33.214
Would you take me off?

1354
01:22:33.381 --> 01:22:36.384
I can't really
swing that $500 yearly.


1355
01:22:36.551 --> 01:22:37.802
MAN: Hey.

1356
01:22:40.346 --> 01:22:41.431
Hey, man.

1357
01:22:41.514 --> 01:22:42.766
You're sure?
Because I feel like


1358
01:22:42.891 --> 01:22:44.142
we're really
onto something here.


1359
01:22:44.309 --> 01:22:47.187
Do you mind?
I'm working.


1360
01:22:47.353 --> 01:22:49.355
This is one of the best
profiles I've ever done.


1361
01:22:49.522 --> 01:22:50.857
And our refund policy,
well, we don't have one...


1362
01:22:51.483 --> 01:22:53.318
Todd, I got to go.

1363
01:22:55.236 --> 01:22:56.237
Sean.

1364
01:22:57.155 --> 01:22:58.239
Yeah.

1365
01:23:04.996 --> 01:23:07.040
It's Walter.

1366
01:23:10.668 --> 01:23:12.378
Mitty.

1367
01:23:21.387 --> 01:23:22.388
Walter Mitty.

1368
01:23:23.264 --> 01:23:24.891
Seriously?

1369
01:23:27.018 --> 01:23:29.229
How the hell did
you get up here?


1370
01:23:30.063 --> 01:23:31.564
I just...

1371
01:23:35.235 --> 01:23:36.945
I've been looking for you.

1372
01:23:39.948 --> 01:23:41.533
Sit down.

1373
01:23:48.373 --> 01:23:49.749
I'll sit.

1374
01:23:57.757 --> 01:23:59.592
Well, take your time.
Settle in.


1375
01:23:59.759 --> 01:24:01.594
Try to be
real still, okay?


1376
01:24:04.055 --> 01:24:05.640
There's a snow leopard.

1377
01:24:06.766 --> 01:24:09.310
Right in this ridge.

1378
01:24:10.144 --> 01:24:13.815
So we have to try to be very,
very, very, very still.


1379
01:24:16.943 --> 01:24:19.445
They call the snow
leopard the "ghost cat."


1380
01:24:21.447 --> 01:24:23.741
it never lets
itself be seen.


1381
01:24:28.496 --> 01:24:30.498
Ghost cat?

1382
01:24:33.751 --> 01:24:37.297
Beautiful things
don't ask for attention.


1383
01:24:42.844 --> 01:24:48.099
Sean, there was a negative that
got separated from your roll.


1384
01:24:50.184 --> 01:24:53.146
I'm taking a lot of
heat over it at work.


1385
01:24:53.313 --> 01:24:57.150
It never came with the
roll that you sent.


1386
01:24:57.317 --> 01:24:59.152
The last roll
you're talking about?


1387
01:24:59.319 --> 01:25:00.445
Yeah.

1388
01:25:00.570 --> 01:25:01.654
The 25.

1389
01:25:03.114 --> 01:25:04.782
Yeah.

1390
01:25:05.992 --> 01:25:07.952
You're sitting on it.

1391
01:25:10.997 --> 01:25:12.874
Why am I sitting on it?

1392
01:25:14.292 --> 01:25:16.169
It's in your wallet.

1393
01:25:17.003 --> 01:25:19.047
That was the gift.

1394
01:25:19.213 --> 01:25:20.965
The photograph.

1395
01:25:21.132 --> 01:25:23.009
The wallet was just something
I could put it in.


1396
01:25:23.176 --> 01:25:26.638
So, I put it in a little slot, the
little picture holder in there.


1397
01:25:26.804 --> 01:25:28.473
I thought it
would be cute.


1398
01:25:31.059 --> 01:25:32.894
I told you,
"look inside."


1399
01:25:33.561 --> 01:25:35.188
In the note.

1400
01:25:35.480 --> 01:25:36.648
You said "look inside."

1401
01:25:36.814 --> 01:25:40.026
I thought you meant look
inside of the wrapping paper.


1402
01:25:40.568 --> 01:25:43.196
Yeah? Well, you got a real
nice surprise coming.


1403
01:25:43.363 --> 01:25:45.531
No, I don't have it.

1404
01:25:45.698 --> 01:25:47.617
I don't have
it anymore.


1405
01:25:47.700 --> 01:25:48.701
Whoa!

1406
01:25:54.582 --> 01:25:56.542
What the hell
were you thinking?


1407
01:25:58.836 --> 01:26:01.756
I mean, I'm sorry, I've admired
you for a very long time...


1408
01:26:01.923 --> 01:26:05.593
but that is not a good move, at
all, with a valuable negative.


1409
01:26:05.760 --> 01:26:07.720
Sorry, I just...

1410
01:26:07.887 --> 01:26:10.431
I thought it would be
a playful kind of thing.


1411
01:26:10.598 --> 01:26:12.058
Playful?

1412
01:26:13.267 --> 01:26:14.852
Too playful.

1413
01:26:16.229 --> 01:26:17.563
I see what you're saying.

1414
01:26:17.730 --> 01:26:20.400
With the cover, I should have
been more straightforward.


1415
01:26:20.566 --> 01:26:23.611
But can I ask you, I mean,
if you don't mind...


1416
01:26:24.570 --> 01:26:26.364
what did you do
with the wallet?


1417
01:26:27.407 --> 01:26:28.866
Chucked it.

1418
01:26:31.202 --> 01:26:33.329
Well, that hurts
my feelings.


1419
01:26:34.580 --> 01:26:36.582
No. Man, I liked
it very much.


1420
01:26:36.749 --> 01:26:38.084
I appreciated
it very much.


1421
01:26:38.251 --> 01:26:39.252
So you threw it away?

1422
01:26:43.589 --> 01:26:46.509
So, you have no
idea what it was?


1423
01:26:47.593 --> 01:26:48.594
The photograph?

1424
01:26:52.432 --> 01:26:53.766
It's a shame.

1425
01:26:56.269 --> 01:26:58.104
It was a beauty.

1426
01:27:06.029 --> 01:27:07.030
(MEN YELLING)

1427
01:27:14.704 --> 01:27:17.081
How did you
find me, anyway?


1428
01:27:19.625 --> 01:27:20.877
My mom.

1429
01:27:21.753 --> 01:27:24.964
Cool lady. Knows
how to bake.


1430
01:27:25.381 --> 01:27:26.883
Yeah.

1431
01:27:29.552 --> 01:27:30.803
Hey' Why did you--
Shh!


1432
01:28:07.048 --> 01:28:09.592
When are you gonna take it?

1433
01:28:13.679 --> 01:28:15.598
Sometimes I don't.

1434
01:28:16.474 --> 01:28:18.267
If I like a moment...

1435
01:28:18.893 --> 01:28:22.563
I mean, me, personally...

1436
01:28:24.524 --> 01:28:27.693
I don't like to have the
distraction of the camera.


1437
01:28:31.197 --> 01:28:35.034
Just want to stay in it.

1438
01:28:38.538 --> 01:28:40.206
Stay in it?

1439
01:28:41.707 --> 01:28:43.376
Yeah, right there.

1440
01:28:44.544 --> 01:28:46.379
Right here.

1441
01:28:49.715 --> 01:28:51.551
Now it's gone.
It's gone.


1442
01:28:58.141 --> 01:28:59.600
That looks like fun.

1443
01:28:59.934 --> 01:29:01.894
I think I'm
gonna jump in.


1444
01:29:03.020 --> 01:29:05.398
Hey, what was
the picture, Sean?


1445
01:29:06.274 --> 01:29:09.402
We're gonna be odd-numbered
if you don't join.


1446
01:29:10.736 --> 01:29:13.030
What was the picture?

1447
01:29:14.073 --> 01:29:17.785
Let's just call it a
ghost cat, Walter Mitty.


1448
01:29:25.334 --> 01:29:27.628
What's in your hand

1449
01:29:28.754 --> 01:29:31.966
You're pinned down to routines

1450
01:29:35.595 --> 01:29:38.181
Elevate and leave

1451
01:29:38.931 --> 01:29:41.350
The flickering screen

1452
01:29:45.563 --> 01:29:48.774
Where nothing is compromised

1453
01:29:49.650 --> 01:29:51.903
Nothing is lost

1454
01:29:55.907 --> 01:29:58.993
When everything is realized

1455
01:30:00.244 --> 01:30:02.330
Nothing is crossed

1456
01:31:04.934 --> 01:31:06.686
MAN: You made
the watch list.


1457
01:31:06.852 --> 01:31:09.563
How did you get to Afghanistan?
There's a travel ban.

(SIGHS)

1459
01:31:10.773 --> 01:31:12.316
Through Yemen.

1460
01:31:13.567 --> 01:31:15.486
Violent place.

1461
01:31:16.445 --> 01:31:18.739
That's why the air
fare is only $84.


1462
01:31:19.824 --> 01:31:21.742
Can I have
my fife back?


1463
01:31:23.786 --> 01:31:25.621
Do you know anyone
in Los Angeles?


1464
01:31:25.788 --> 01:31:27.957
No.
Any acquaintances? Okay.


1465
01:31:28.124 --> 01:31:29.125
Any companions?

1466
01:31:29.292 --> 01:31:32.545
Anybody here who might be able to
verify that you're Walter Mitty?


1467
01:31:38.718 --> 01:31:39.719
(DOOR BUZZES)

1468
01:31:42.722 --> 01:31:44.307
MAN: Walter Mitty?

1469
01:31:44.515 --> 01:31:45.516
Yeah.

1471
01:31:49.770 --> 01:31:50.771
Hey.

1472
01:31:52.398 --> 01:31:53.399
Thank you.
Thanks.


1473
01:31:53.566 --> 01:31:55.109
What? Come here.

1474
01:31:55.276 --> 01:31:56.819
Come here.
(GROANING)


1475
01:31:56.986 --> 01:31:58.404
Backpack.

1476
01:31:58.571 --> 01:31:59.905
Big hug!

1477
01:32:00.156 --> 01:32:02.241
Airport prison, huh?

1478
01:32:02.325 --> 01:32:03.326
Yeah.

1479
01:32:03.451 --> 01:32:05.995
Tell me all about it over a Cinnabon.
Come on.


1480
01:32:06.162 --> 01:32:07.747
Cinnabon!

1481
01:32:09.790 --> 01:32:11.876
How long were you
detained for, by the way?


1482
01:32:13.252 --> 01:32:14.920
Like, 17 hours.

1483
01:32:15.296 --> 01:32:17.590
Wow! How's that
Cinnabon taste?


1484
01:32:17.757 --> 01:32:18.758
Really great.

1485
01:32:18.966 --> 01:32:21.761
That's frosted heroin. That's
what you're eating, my friend.


1486
01:32:21.927 --> 01:32:24.638
That's what you're having
right there, man.


1487
01:32:24.722 --> 01:32:25.681
By the way--

1488
01:32:25.765 --> 01:32:29.560
you got 300 winks before I
took down your profile.


1489
01:32:29.727 --> 01:32:32.313
In the space of two hours.
It was crazy.


1490
01:32:32.480 --> 01:32:33.981
I thought I was selling
concert tickets.


1491
01:32:34.899 --> 01:32:36.150
I never checked.

1492
01:32:36.275 --> 01:32:38.110
Oh! Because of...

1493
01:32:38.986 --> 01:32:41.697
the "Pina Colada"
girl that quit?


1494
01:32:42.531 --> 01:32:44.075
Yeah.
Yeah.

Cheryl, who did not respond
to a single wink...


1497
01:32:50.956 --> 01:32:52.291
the whole time
she was on there.


1498
01:32:52.708 --> 01:32:54.210
That's a choosy lady.

1499
01:32:54.627 --> 01:32:57.588
(SING-SONG)
That's a choosy lady.


1500
01:32:57.671 --> 01:32:58.672
(CHUCKLES)

1501
01:32:59.048 --> 01:33:00.132
How's the...

1502
01:33:01.759 --> 01:33:03.719
daydreaming going?

1503
01:33:06.639 --> 01:33:07.973
Lately, less.

1504
01:33:09.809 --> 01:33:10.976
Good.

1505
01:33:11.143 --> 01:33:12.311
Less is good.

1506
01:33:13.104 --> 01:33:14.397
Thanks for the pastry.

1507
01:33:14.563 --> 01:33:16.649
Yeah, well, you owe me.
(CHUCKLES)


1508
01:33:16.816 --> 01:33:19.193
I'll send you a check
as soon as I sell the piano.


1509
01:33:20.820 --> 01:33:22.530
You have a lot
on your plate.


1510
01:33:23.280 --> 01:33:25.199
What are you
gonna do now?


1511
01:33:26.325 --> 01:33:28.119
Go out and
get another job.


1512
01:33:32.331 --> 01:33:33.332
Boom!
(CHUCKLES)


1513
01:33:35.668 --> 01:33:37.169
Sorry, Walter,
I just...


1514
01:33:37.336 --> 01:33:38.295
What?

1515
01:33:38.379 --> 01:33:40.172
You are so not
how I pictured you.


1516
01:33:41.298 --> 01:33:42.800
How did you picture me?

1517
01:33:42.967 --> 01:33:45.428
I pictured you as a little
gray piece of paper.


1518
01:33:46.095 --> 01:33:47.513
But now I see you...

1519
01:33:47.680 --> 01:33:49.765
and it's like
Indiana Jones...


1520
01:33:49.932 --> 01:33:51.225
decided to become
the lead singer


1521
01:33:51.350 --> 01:33:52.685
of The Strokes or
something like that.


1522
01:33:52.852 --> 01:33:54.645
(LAUGHS)
It's nuts. I know.


1523
01:34:15.124 --> 01:34:16.459
Sorry, Mom.

1524
01:34:16.625 --> 01:34:17.793
What for?

1525
01:34:18.878 --> 01:34:20.963
Dad bought it for you.
It was my responsibility.


1526
01:34:21.714 --> 01:34:22.882
Oh, Walter.

1527
01:34:23.424 --> 01:34:24.467
We're all grown here.

1528
01:34:24.550 --> 01:34:26.427
We're all good.

1529
01:34:48.449 --> 01:34:49.492
Ooh!

1530
01:34:49.575 --> 01:34:51.911
That's heavy
duty, that sum.


1531
01:34:52.077 --> 01:34:53.913
You should put
this in your wallet.


1532
01:34:54.079 --> 01:34:55.789
I don't have one.
Oh.


1533
01:35:05.341 --> 01:35:06.383
I found it
in the trash.


1534
01:35:06.550 --> 01:35:09.220
I always save
your knick-knacks.


1535
01:35:14.934 --> 01:35:16.268
Thanks.

1536
01:35:19.230 --> 01:35:20.356
Got it, Mom?
Got it.


1537
01:35:20.523 --> 01:35:21.899
Watch the stairs.

1538
01:36:06.485 --> 01:36:07.987
TED: I think this works.

1539
01:36:08.153 --> 01:36:10.864

This says it all.


1540
01:36:12.324 --> 01:36:13.450
Oh, hey. Welcome.

1541
01:36:13.617 --> 01:36:15.661
Wait, I'm sorry,
not welcome.


1542
01:36:15.828 --> 01:36:17.705
Not an employee.

1543
01:36:18.289 --> 01:36:19.707
Sorry.

1544
01:36:23.877 --> 01:36:26.672
There's the picture
Sean wanted. 25.


1545
01:36:30.175 --> 01:36:32.845
You have two days
to print for cover.


1546
01:36:35.347 --> 01:36:37.516
There's your quintessence.

1547
01:36:41.520 --> 01:36:42.563
Hey.

1548
01:36:44.523 --> 01:36:46.358
Do you know our motto?

1549
01:36:49.236 --> 01:36:50.821
"Life...

1550
01:36:52.323 --> 01:36:55.200
"I'm lovin' it?"

1551
01:36:55.743 --> 01:36:56.869
No.

1552
01:36:57.202 --> 01:36:59.204
That's McDonald's.

1553
01:37:01.915 --> 01:37:04.043
This thing that
you do, Ted...


1554
01:37:04.209 --> 01:37:06.670
where you come into a place
and you push people out.


1555
01:37:09.006 --> 01:37:10.841
You should know that those
people worked really hard


1556
01:37:10.966 --> 01:37:12.843
to build this magazine.

1557
01:37:15.095 --> 01:37:16.847
They believed
in the motto.


1558
01:37:17.848 --> 01:37:19.016
And I get it. You got
your marching orders...


1559
01:37:19.183 --> 01:37:21.935
and you have to do
what you have to do.


1560
01:37:23.437 --> 01:37:25.856
But you don't have
to be such a dick.


1561
01:37:29.401 --> 01:37:33.364
Put that on a plaque, and
hang it at your next job.


1562
01:37:44.458 --> 01:37:47.586
What was it? Sasquatch?
A unicorn?


1563
01:37:47.753 --> 01:37:49.588
The negative?
Yeah.


1564
01:37:50.255 --> 01:37:51.757
I didn't look.
(SCOFFS)


1565
01:37:52.841 --> 01:37:53.842
(CHUCKLES)

1566
01:37:57.054 --> 01:37:59.139
You were
a good boss, Walter.


1567
01:38:01.433 --> 01:38:02.976
Thanks, man.

1568
01:39:21.513 --> 01:39:23.056
Hey, Walter.
What's up?


1569
01:39:23.223 --> 01:39:24.683
Check this out.

1570
01:39:34.109 --> 01:39:35.110
(CHUCKLES)

1571
01:39:37.029 --> 01:39:38.238
See you!

1572
01:39:40.032 --> 01:39:41.116
Hi.

1573
01:39:52.377 --> 01:39:54.713
Walter Mitty.
Severance package.


1574
01:40:36.755 --> 01:40:37.923
Hey.

1575
01:40:38.799 --> 01:40:40.092
Cheryl.

1576
01:40:41.927 --> 01:40:43.303
Hey-
Hey-


1577
01:40:43.971 --> 01:40:46.431
I got that email
from Rich yesterday.


1578
01:40:46.598 --> 01:40:47.850
He's really good.

1579
01:40:48.016 --> 01:40:49.268
Walter, thank you.

1580
01:40:49.434 --> 01:40:50.686
That was...

1581
01:40:50.853 --> 01:40:54.022
That was just a really
cool thing to do.


1582
01:40:54.189 --> 01:40:56.191
I just saw it
in Iceland.


1583
01:40:56.775 --> 01:40:57.776
He loves it.

1584
01:40:57.943 --> 01:40:59.820
And I'm taking
him this afternoon.


1585
01:41:02.281 --> 01:41:04.157
Hey, I wanted
you to know...


1586
01:41:04.867 --> 01:41:06.451
you weren't boring me.

1587
01:41:07.327 --> 01:41:08.871
That day in the park.

1588
01:41:10.330 --> 01:41:11.540
I was...

1589
01:41:12.958 --> 01:41:13.959
I was thinking about...

1590
01:41:14.126 --> 01:41:18.297
I hope this doesn't sound weird,
but I was thinking about you.


1591
01:41:20.215 --> 01:41:23.719
When I was in Greenland,
they do karaoke there...


1592
01:41:24.386 --> 01:41:29.474
and I had to get on this helicopter,
with a very drunk pilot.


1593
01:41:30.350 --> 01:41:32.978
And I started
to imagine you...


1594
01:41:33.645 --> 01:41:35.689
singing Major Tom.

1595
01:41:38.483 --> 01:41:40.152
Anyway...

1596
01:41:41.069 --> 01:41:43.238
it got me
on the helicopter.


1597
01:41:43.405 --> 01:41:47.492
And it got me
where I wanted to go.


1598
01:41:50.037 --> 01:41:51.038
So, what happened
to you?


1599
01:41:51.204 --> 01:41:54.416
You sort of fell off
the face of the Earth there.


1600
01:41:54.583 --> 01:41:56.001
For a little bit.

1601
01:41:56.668 --> 01:41:58.837
I came by and...

1602
01:41:59.004 --> 01:42:01.840
your husband answered so I
figured I should just go.


1603
01:42:03.216 --> 01:42:06.553
Phil. He was
fixing my refrigerator.


1604
01:42:06.720 --> 01:42:08.513
And he's not
my husband.


1605
01:42:09.890 --> 01:42:11.850
I guess I imagined...

1606
01:42:13.727 --> 01:42:16.021
I thought maybe you
got back together.


1607
01:42:16.730 --> 01:42:18.857
You have a good
imagination.


1608
01:42:19.024 --> 01:42:20.525
But no.

1609
01:42:23.111 --> 01:42:25.697
Hey, my sister got
this role in Grease.


1610
01:42:25.864 --> 01:42:27.074
Rizzo.

1611
01:42:27.240 --> 01:42:29.576
Not on Broadway.
In some weird church.


1612
01:42:32.537 --> 01:42:34.081
Do you want
to go with me?


1613
01:42:35.123 --> 01:42:36.750
I made that sound
really not good.


1614
01:42:36.917 --> 01:42:38.085
Yeah.

1615
01:42:38.961 --> 01:42:40.212
Yeah?

1616
01:42:40.545 --> 01:42:43.590
Yeah, yeah.
I would love to.


1617
01:42:43.757 --> 01:42:46.593
Grease in a weird church?
Are you kidding?


1618
01:42:46.760 --> 01:42:48.887
Rizzo, that's
the best part.


1619
01:42:49.221 --> 01:42:52.140
Yeah, Rizzo. (CHUCKLES)
Tough and tender.


1620
01:42:52.307 --> 01:42:53.725
Yeah.

1621
01:42:54.559 --> 01:42:55.894
Great.

1622
01:42:56.603 --> 01:42:58.814
Are you heading Uptown?

1623
01:42:59.481 --> 01:43:00.482
Sure.

1624
01:43:00.565 --> 01:43:01.566
Yeah?

1625
01:43:03.652 --> 01:43:05.737
I actually always
related to Rizzo more.


1626
01:43:05.904 --> 01:43:07.406
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.


1627
01:43:07.572 --> 01:43:10.659
Was it the smoking
and the teenage sex?


1628
01:43:10.826 --> 01:43:13.745
No. She was
just real, I guess.


1629
01:43:13.912 --> 01:43:14.913
Oh!

1630
01:43:15.122 --> 01:43:18.291
The last issue, it should be here.
It came out this morning.


1631
01:43:39.104 --> 01:43:41.440
Man. Walter.

1632
01:44:00.125 --> 01:44:02.502
Should we go buy
one of those?


1633
01:44:02.669 --> 01:44:04.421
Yeah. I was
probably gonna...


1634
01:44:04.588 --> 01:44:06.256
Probably gonna go back later?
Yeah.


1635
01:44:06.423 --> 01:44:10.135
I just didn't want to seem
uncool and get one right away.


1636
01:44:41.875 --> 01:44:45.295
There's a rhythm
in rush these days


1637
01:44:47.839 --> 01:44:51.718
Where the lines don't move
and the colors don't fade


1638
01:44:54.763 --> 01:44:58.225
Leaves you empty
with nothing but dreams


1639
01:45:00.811 --> 01:45:04.689
In a world gone shallow
In a world gone lean


1640
01:45:07.734 --> 01:45:11.321
Sometimes there's things
a man cannot know


1641
01:45:14.199 --> 01:45:17.661
The gears won't turn
and the leaves won't grow


1642
01:45:20.539 --> 01:45:24.376
There's no place to run
and no gasoline


1643
01:45:27.087 --> 01:45:30.382
Engine won't turn
And the train won't leave


1644
01:45:33.552 --> 01:45:37.639
Engines won't turn
And the train won't leave


1645
01:45:39.891 --> 01:45:43.228
I will stay with you tonight

1646
01:45:46.398 --> 01:45:50.068
Hold you close
'til the morning light


1647
01:45:52.696 --> 01:45:56.324
In the morning watch
a new day rise


1648
01:45:59.244 --> 01:46:02.998
We'll do whatever
just to stay alive


1649
01:46:05.667 --> 01:46:09.504
We'll do whatever
just to stay alive


1650
01:46:11.882 --> 01:46:15.427
Well, the way I feel is
the way I write


1651
01:46:17.804 --> 01:46:21.391
Racin' like the thoughts
of the man who lies


1652
01:46:23.310 --> 01:46:26.521
There is a truth and
it's on our side


1653
01:46:28.773 --> 01:46:32.194
Dawn is coming
Open your eyes


1654
01:46:34.487 --> 01:46:38.158
Look into the sun
as the new days rise


1655
01:46:39.951 --> 01:46:43.371
And I will wait
for you tonight


1656
01:46:45.415 --> 01:46:49.211
You're here forever
and you're by my side


1657
01:46:50.837 --> 01:46:54.674
I've been waiting all my life

1658
01:46:56.468 --> 01:47:00.305
To feel your heart
as it's keeping time


1659
01:47:02.140 --> 01:47:06.019
We'll do whatever
just to stay alive


1660
01:47:23.370 --> 01:47:26.539
Dawn is coming
Open your eyes


1661
01:47:30.710 --> 01:47:34.130
Dawn is coming
Open your eyes


1662
01:47:38.093 --> 01:47:41.972
Dawn is coming
Open your eyes


1663
01:47:45.517 --> 01:47:49.729
Dawn is coming
Open your eyes


1664
01:48:00.282 --> 01:48:04.953
Look into the sun
as the new days rise


1665
01:48:09.541 --> 01:48:13.003
There's a rhythm
in rush these days


1666
01:48:15.547 --> 01:48:19.426
Where the lines don't move
and the colors don't fade


1667
01:48:22.387 --> 01:48:25.849
Leaves you empty
with nothing but dreams


1668
01:48:28.435 --> 01:48:32.439
In a world gone shallow
In a world gone lean


1669
01:48:35.400 --> 01:48:38.611
But there is a truth
and it's on our side


1670
01:48:41.865 --> 01:48:45.118
Dawn is coming, open your eyes

1671
01:48:48.371 --> 01:48:52.584
Look into the sun
as a new days rise


1672
01:49:02.677 --> 01:49:05.513
Step outside,
I'm gonna step outside


1673
01:49:09.309 --> 01:49:12.354
Step outside,
I'm gonna step outside


1674
01:49:26.117 --> 01:49:29.120
Heart's on fire,
leave it all behind you


1675
01:49:39.297 --> 01:49:42.717
Dark as night,
let the lightning guide you


1676
01:49:49.432 --> 01:49:52.185
Step outside,
I'm gonna step outside


1677
01:49:59.317 --> 01:50:02.737
Heart's on fire,
leave it all behind you


1678
01:50:03.446 --> 01:50:09.077
Living life
Feeding appetites


1679
01:50:09.911 --> 01:50:15.417
Stake through every heart
stop in the mood


1680
01:50:16.835 --> 01:50:19.212
Being glad

1681
01:50:19.963 --> 01:50:22.924
Breathing half the time

1682
01:50:32.684 --> 01:50:35.937
Heart's on fire,
leave it all behind you


1683
01:50:45.655 --> 01:50:49.284
Dark as night,
let the lightning guide you


1684
01:50:49.409 --> 01:50:51.995
Step outside,
I'm gonna step outside


1685
01:51:19.606 --> 01:51:22.609
Broke to Monday

1686
01:51:22.901 --> 01:51:25.278
Something's not the same

1687
01:51:26.237 --> 01:51:28.114
Blank head

1688
01:51:28.239 --> 01:51:30.909
Cross tiles sweep the floor

1689
01:51:32.869 --> 01:51:37.624
Feel your presence
in your absence


1690
01:51:37.916 --> 01:51:39.417
Shut the door

1691
01:51:48.718 --> 01:51:52.096
Heart's on fire,
leave it all behind you


1692
01:52:01.981 --> 01:52:05.360
Dark as night,
let the lightning guide you


1693
01:52:08.363 --> 01:52:11.908
Must believe in

1694
01:52:11.991 --> 01:52:14.953
Step outside
Take a step outside


1695
01:52:15.036 --> 01:52:16.621
Take a step outside

1696
01:52:21.709 --> 01:52:25.171
Must believe in

1697
01:52:25.255 --> 01:52:28.216
Step outside
Take a step outside


1698
01:52:28.299 --> 01:52:29.884
Take a step outside

1699
01:52:35.473 --> 01:52:38.810
Heart's on fire,
leave it all behind you


1700
01:53:06.254 --> 01:53:08.631
You know I love my lady

1701
01:53:09.924 --> 01:53:12.051
We've been together so long

1702
01:53:13.511 --> 01:53:15.972
Like a worn-out recording

1703
01:53:17.265 --> 01:53:19.058
Of my favorite song

1704
01:53:20.560 --> 01:53:22.979
So while she lay
there sleepin'


1705
01:53:24.147 --> 01:53:26.065
I read the paper in bed

1706
01:53:27.609 --> 01:53:30.194
And in the personal columns,

1707
01:53:31.195 --> 01:53:33.114
There was this letter
that read


1708
01:53:34.782 --> 01:53:37.493
If you like pina coladas

1709
01:53:38.411 --> 01:53:40.455
Or getting caught in the rain

1710
01:53:42.165 --> 01:53:44.584
And the feel of the ocean

1711
01:53:45.710 --> 01:53:47.879
And the taste of champagne

1712
01:53:49.005 --> 01:53:51.424
If you like making love
at midnight


1713
01:53:52.717 --> 01:53:54.844
In the dunes of the cape

1714
01:53:56.095 --> 01:53:58.806
Then you're the lady
that I look for


1715
01:53:59.891 --> 01:54:01.976
Come with me and escape
