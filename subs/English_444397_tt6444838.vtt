00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:57.579
THE WORKSHOP

2
00:02:40.093 --> 00:02:42.187
There's nothing at first.

3
00:02:48.401 --> 00:02:50.062
Take the plunge.

4
00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:52.864
You can say whatever you like.

5
00:02:58.044 --> 00:02:59.170
A murder maybe?

6
00:02:59.379 --> 00:03:01.848
A good start for a thriller.

7
00:03:02.048 --> 00:03:02.742
Bravo!

8
00:03:04.884 --> 00:03:07.216
A murder isn't always at the start.

9
00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:09.616
You're right.

10
00:03:10.356 --> 00:03:13.724
It it starts with a murder,
what happens?


11
00:03:13.926 --> 00:03:15.394
Do we witness it?

12
00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:19.626
No, it's not good to see it.

13
00:03:19.866 --> 00:03:21.960
We mustn't know who did it.

14
00:03:22.135 --> 00:03:24.263
Literature is good that way.

15
00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:26.734
You can keep things back.

16
00:03:26.939 --> 00:03:31.206
You can describe the crime
without showing the killer's face.


17
00:03:31.411 --> 00:03:32.708
Like in a movie.

18
00:03:32.912 --> 00:03:36.041
It's dark
or you see through his eyes.


19
00:03:36.916 --> 00:03:39.715
- A subjective camera.
- Right.


20
00:03:39.919 --> 00:03:41.011
What is this?

21
00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:44.315
Mastermind?
What are these fancy terms?


22
00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:45.958
Subjective camera?

23
00:03:46.159 --> 00:03:47.456
Who can explain?

24
00:03:48.227 --> 00:03:49.695
It's when

25
00:03:50.163 --> 00:03:53.929
the camera replaces the character.
You see what he sees.


26
00:03:54.667 --> 00:03:55.759
Thanks.

27
00:03:56.669 --> 00:03:58.637
So do we see the murder'?

28
00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:02.005
I thought...

29
00:04:02.241 --> 00:04:06.235
The corpse could be found
floating in the harbor...


30
00:04:06.446 --> 00:04:07.641
I like that.

31
00:04:07.847 --> 00:04:09.713
Not very corpse-like.

32
00:04:09.949 --> 00:04:10.745
Why not?

33
00:04:11.684 --> 00:04:13.015
He could've drowned.

34
00:04:13.252 --> 00:04:14.378
All right...

35
00:04:14.587 --> 00:04:16.578
So how do we make it clear?

36
00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:18.314
Riddled with bullets.

37
00:04:18.758 --> 00:04:21.193
A bullet-riddled corpse.

38
00:04:21.361 --> 00:04:22.988
No weapon nearby.

39
00:04:23.429 --> 00:04:26.797
It's not suicide,
so it has to be a murder.


40
00:04:27.433 --> 00:04:29.595
A round from an AK-47.

41
00:04:30.336 --> 00:04:32.134
No one suicides by AK-47.

42
00:04:32.605 --> 00:04:36.872
A Kalashnikov is a war weapon.

43
00:04:37.343 --> 00:04:38.538
It slices you in two.

44
00:04:38.778 --> 00:04:40.268
Too gory

45
00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:42.642
Play with your dolls!

46
00:04:42.849 --> 00:04:45.875
You see sicker stuff
on the Net or TV.

47
00:04:46.119 --> 00:04:48.611
- I don't watch.
- Come on!


48
00:04:48.821 --> 00:04:51.756
Any social network you use,

49
00:04:52.225 --> 00:04:53.090
you find it.

50
00:04:53.326 --> 00:04:55.192
The other day, a pal

51
00:04:55.395 --> 00:04:58.490
posted a video of ISIS beheading guys.

52
00:04:59.165 --> 00:05:00.530
Often there's no title.

53
00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.594
Know the worst? 
I saw this video

54
00:05:03.803 --> 00:05:06.135
of two-year old kids twerking...

55
00:05:06.339 --> 00:05:08.330
- What?
- Wiggling their butts.


56
00:05:09.575 --> 00:05:10.371
It's a dance.

57
00:05:10.576 --> 00:05:12.567
There's a link with ISIS?

58
00:05:13.746 --> 00:05:16.044
Stuff like that goes viral.

59
00:05:17.183 --> 00:05:19.311
It's almost porn, that dance.

60
00:05:19.519 --> 00:05:21.647
No one makes you watch.

61
00:05:21.854 --> 00:05:22.685
Not always.

62
00:05:22.889 --> 00:05:24.015
I thought...

63
00:05:25.057 --> 00:05:28.493
the corpse could be found disfigured.

64
00:05:28.928 --> 00:05:32.125
Like someone threw acid over it.

65
00:05:32.732 --> 00:05:36.327
The forehead's run into the eyes
so you can't


66
00:05:36.536 --> 00:05:37.901
recognize the eyes.

67
00:05:38.104 --> 00:05:40.266
The cheeks have run too.

68
00:05:40.506 --> 00:05:43.498
The teeth have slipped...

69
00:05:43.709 --> 00:05:45.143
Ghost rider teeth.

70
00:05:46.679 --> 00:05:47.646
All right...

71
00:05:47.847 --> 00:05:51.374
So we have to imagine the whole story.

72
00:05:51.884 --> 00:05:54.319
It's like some US series.

73
00:05:54.587 --> 00:05:56.555
- With suspense.
- Suspense!


74
00:05:56.756 --> 00:05:59.191
We'll need a CSI team.

75
00:05:59.725 --> 00:06:01.853
That's very American.

76
00:06:02.795 --> 00:06:04.320
What's that in French?

77
00:06:04.564 --> 00:06:05.656
Pathologists.

78
00:06:05.865 --> 00:06:08.163
Pathologists? Seriously?

79
00:06:08.634 --> 00:06:11.831
I'm sick of DNA.
There's no more mystery.


80
00:06:12.905 --> 00:06:14.031
- What?
- I agree.


81
00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:17.210
- What do you suggest?
- I dunno.


82
00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:20.304
Not identifying the victim is good,

83
00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:23.279
but I imagined more psychology.

84
00:06:23.483 --> 00:06:25.451
Psychology?

85
00:06:25.651 --> 00:06:27.312
The lady knows big words!

86
00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:29.388
Boys aren't into that.

87
00:06:29.589 --> 00:06:32.456
We learn about the victim bit by bit...

88
00:06:32.658 --> 00:06:35.457
How do you do that?
In flashbacks?


89
00:06:35.661 --> 00:06:37.493
Yeah, flashbacks maybe.

90
00:06:37.730 --> 00:06:40.222
A guy on the docks at night...

91
00:06:40.433 --> 00:06:42.458
He's there for a reason.

92
00:06:42.668 --> 00:06:46.263
Do you mean a specific area
of the docks?


93
00:06:46.472 --> 00:06:48.270
Visualize the place.

94
00:06:48.474 --> 00:06:51.409
It'll help you to describe the scene.

95
00:06:52.478 --> 00:06:53.570
I was thinking

96
00:06:54.413 --> 00:06:55.847
of the shipyard.

97
00:06:56.015 --> 00:06:59.110
It's a monumental setting, it's great.

98
00:06:59.318 --> 00:07:00.979
It's really La Ciotat's past.

99
00:07:01.187 --> 00:07:03.713
I thought of that right away.

100
00:07:03.956 --> 00:07:07.893
We all think of it-
Not very original of you-.


101
00:07:08.961 --> 00:07:11.760
Sorry. Forgive me, Boubacar.

102
00:07:11.964 --> 00:07:13.261
Something classier

103
00:07:13.466 --> 00:07:15.798
or more modern like the marina.

104
00:07:16.002 --> 00:07:18.198
Yachts, billionaires...

105
00:07:18.437 --> 00:07:23.432
Or someplace else...
Boston, Washington, New York...


106
00:07:23.643 --> 00:07:24.906
Here isn't good'?

107
00:07:25.344 --> 00:07:29.372
Look around.
Le Mugel, the coves, nice places...


108
00:07:29.615 --> 00:07:32.414
You and your US cliches... Gangs,

109
00:07:32.618 --> 00:07:33.881
the mafia, etc.

110
00:07:34.053 --> 00:07:37.683
You write a story
to escape your shit life.


111
00:07:38.157 --> 00:07:40.626
The novel has to be set here?

112
00:07:41.127 --> 00:07:42.253
Yes.

113
00:07:42.461 --> 00:07:46.796
The idea of this workshop
is to write about your town.


114
00:07:46.999 --> 00:07:48.125
A novel is fiction,

115
00:07:48.334 --> 00:07:49.301
imagination.

116
00:07:49.502 --> 00:07:52.767
We can't write in isolation
or looking in a mirror.


117
00:07:52.972 --> 00:07:53.803
It's dumb.

118
00:07:55.641 --> 00:07:58.508
You don't have to look in a mirror.

119
00:07:58.711 --> 00:08:00.645
Use your imagination

120
00:08:00.846 --> 00:08:03.372
to make your daily life an adventure...

121
00:08:04.584 --> 00:08:06.109
What's so funny'?

122
00:08:06.886 --> 00:08:08.411
An adventure...

123
00:08:09.221 --> 00:08:11.849
Adventure isn't always a world away.

124
00:08:12.658 --> 00:08:15.593
Adventure here will be tough.

125
00:08:15.761 --> 00:08:17.627
We've only just started.

126
00:08:17.863 --> 00:08:19.388
Not in this place.

127
00:08:22.068 --> 00:08:25.504
Let's keep talking,
but I suggest you take notes.


128
00:08:26.606 --> 00:08:28.131
We write already?

129
00:08:28.374 --> 00:08:30.536
No, just take notes.

130
00:08:30.910 --> 00:08:35.711
It the conversation gives you an idea,
note it down somewhere.


131
00:08:35.915 --> 00:08:38.907
- He goes swimming!
- And you don't?


132
00:08:39.385 --> 00:08:41.877
- Towel and all...
- He wants to tan.


133
00:08:42.088 --> 00:08:43.578
You can take notes?

134
00:08:45.691 --> 00:08:48.854
She's just a teacher,
not much of a writer.


135
00:08:49.462 --> 00:08:52.454
I don't like her fancy, arrogant air.

136
00:08:52.698 --> 00:08:54.132
Pretentious, like.

137
00:08:54.300 --> 00:08:56.894
Her Paris accent gets to me.

138
00:08:57.570 --> 00:08:59.937
I barely understand at times.

139
00:09:00.139 --> 00:09:02.164
"I'm delighted to meet you.

140
00:09:02.408 --> 00:09:04.570
"We'll do good work here.“

141
00:09:04.777 --> 00:09:08.042
"Delighted to get a vacation
out of this.“


142
00:09:08.748 --> 00:09:11.877
They rented her a really fancy villa.

143
00:09:13.152 --> 00:09:14.517
The bus!

144
00:09:14.754 --> 00:09:16.688
Shit---
Run!


145
00:09:44.583 --> 00:09:46.017
Hey, Antoine!

146
00:09:47.119 --> 00:09:48.951
Théo, look who's here.

147
00:09:50.990 --> 00:09:52.856
- Doing OK, cuz?
- And you'?


148
00:09:53.492 --> 00:09:54.789
Got a kiss for me'?

149
00:09:55.795 --> 00:09:57.763
Stop it!

150
00:09:58.364 --> 00:10:00.196
- Where were you'?
- Swimming.


151
00:10:01.033 --> 00:10:02.728
I wanna go swimming too.

152
00:10:02.968 --> 00:10:05.096
- You do?
- I'll take you.


153
00:10:06.472 --> 00:10:08.304
- See you.
- Ciao, bro.


154
00:10:08.507 --> 00:10:10.373
- Love you, Théo.
- Say bye.


155
00:10:10.843 --> 00:10:12.208
Ciao, bro.

156
00:10:30.362 --> 00:10:31.352
Hi!

157
00:10:32.832 --> 00:10:34.129
Antoine...

158
00:10:38.137 --> 00:10:40.469
Well'? How did it go?

159
00:10:41.307 --> 00:10:42.468
Fine.

160
00:10:44.210 --> 00:10:47.077
- You'll tell me about it?
- Don't worry-.


161
00:12:24.410 --> 00:12:25.377
PROTECT

162
00:12:26.912 --> 00:12:28.437
HELP OTHERS

163
00:12:32.585 --> 00:12:33.416
PREPARE

164
00:12:36.322 --> 00:12:37.346
TO DEFEND OUR VALUES

165
00:12:38.858 --> 00:12:41.020
THE FRENCH ARMY

166
00:12:49.168 --> 00:12:50.465
Watch out, will you?

167
00:12:50.669 --> 00:12:52.364
Sorry, beauty.

168
00:12:54.807 --> 00:12:55.740
Hello.

169
00:12:57.042 --> 00:12:58.476
Where do I put it?

170
00:12:58.944 --> 00:13:00.105
Here is good.

171
00:13:04.984 --> 00:13:07.078
- Had a good evening?
- And you'?


172
00:13:07.286 --> 00:13:09.254
- I didn't sleep.
- Why?


173
00:13:09.455 --> 00:13:11.253
- I watched an action movie.
- What?


174
00:13:11.457 --> 00:13:12.720
Not your type.

175
00:13:12.892 --> 00:13:15.862
And what do you think I watch?

176
00:13:16.061 --> 00:13:17.551
Gentle movies.

177
00:13:18.564 --> 00:13:19.861
I don't know...

178
00:13:20.833 --> 00:13:22.858
- Benjamin?
- No, nothing.


179
00:13:23.068 --> 00:13:26.732
Ok, thanks.
But please put your phone away.


180
00:13:26.972 --> 00:13:28.736
Etienne, any ideas?

181
00:13:28.908 --> 00:13:31.377
Yes, but nothing really...

182
00:13:31.577 --> 00:13:32.840
It's not worth it.

183
00:13:33.045 --> 00:13:35.673
It is. We'll sort them after.

184
00:13:35.881 --> 00:13:37.906
As we mentioned the shipyard,

185
00:13:38.150 --> 00:13:41.848
why not do a
story set in the past?

186
00:13:42.054 --> 00:13:43.044
Interesting.

187
00:13:43.822 --> 00:13:46.450
Did you have a period in mind?

188
00:13:47.893 --> 00:13:49.224
I thought...

189
00:13:49.828 --> 00:13:51.523
when the yard was active.

190
00:13:51.730 --> 00:13:55.360
Just before it shut down,
when things heated up.


191
00:13:55.567 --> 00:13:58.264
Great.
The chaos, the strikes and all.


192
00:13:58.504 --> 00:14:02.202
It was wild.
They tied the manager to a crane,


193
00:14:02.408 --> 00:14:04.536
burned tollbooths...
Crazy.


194
00:14:04.743 --> 00:14:06.108
They cut the tracks

195
00:14:06.712 --> 00:14:09.238
so the riot police were brought in.

196
00:14:09.715 --> 00:14:12.377
But that was before I was born.

197
00:14:12.718 --> 00:14:14.049
I wasn't born either

198
00:14:14.453 --> 00:14:17.286
but my grandad left Algeria
to work here.


199
00:14:17.523 --> 00:14:19.389
That makes me French now.

200
00:14:19.591 --> 00:14:21.582
French? What's your name'?

201
00:14:25.297 --> 00:14:26.423
Chill, you Arabs.

202
00:14:26.632 --> 00:14:27.963
Let's focus.

203
00:14:28.968 --> 00:14:33.269
Malika's right. It doesn't have to be
a period we've known.


204
00:14:33.472 --> 00:14:36.442
Yesterday you told me the idea

205
00:14:36.642 --> 00:14:39.111
is to talk about our daily lives.

206
00:14:39.812 --> 00:14:41.439
- You said that.
- I did.


207
00:14:41.647 --> 00:14:44.241
But it can be your town's past too.

208
00:14:44.450 --> 00:14:47.044
Your family's experiences.

209
00:14:47.252 --> 00:14:48.549
We don't talk about that.

210
00:14:48.754 --> 00:14:52.622
It's there subconsciously,
you've heard about it.


211
00:14:53.058 --> 00:14:56.517
I've only been in La Ciotat five years.

212
00:14:56.729 --> 00:14:59.721
My grandad told me lots of stuff.

213
00:14:59.932 --> 00:15:03.869
There was pride
in being from La Ciotat.


214
00:15:04.636 --> 00:15:08.402
Pride in welding in the dark
and breathing asbestos?


215
00:15:08.607 --> 00:15:12.441
You saw the result?
The huge things they built'?


216
00:15:13.779 --> 00:15:16.874
I can ask my grandad to help us.

217
00:15:17.783 --> 00:15:19.410
That's interesting.

218
00:15:19.618 --> 00:15:23.248
When you write a novel,
you have to do research


219
00:15:23.789 --> 00:15:27.589
to make your fiction more real.

220
00:15:29.461 --> 00:15:31.327
You're dubious, Antoine?

221
00:15:32.931 --> 00:15:35.730
I'm not keen on
a story in the past.

222
00:15:35.934 --> 00:15:37.732
I have an idea then...

223
00:15:38.303 --> 00:15:40.294
Go on, we're listening.

224
00:15:40.506 --> 00:15:42.372
I mentioned flashbacks.

225
00:15:42.608 --> 00:15:45.077
Our story could be set today,

226
00:15:45.611 --> 00:15:49.206
but the crime's motive
could lie in the past.


227
00:15:51.050 --> 00:15:53.985
That's not bad.
What do you think?


228
00:15:54.186 --> 00:15:57.053
Also, the victim could be black.

229
00:15:57.656 --> 00:15:59.351
Or an Arab.

230
00:15:59.558 --> 00:16:01.993
- Why'?
- Why what?


231
00:16:02.194 --> 00:16:04.891
Why black or Arab?
A racist crime?


232
00:16:05.130 --> 00:16:07.565
- Maybe.
- What's the point?


233
00:16:08.133 --> 00:16:09.623
He's black or Arab.

234
00:16:09.835 --> 00:16:11.098
- That's all?
- Yes.


235
00:16:11.503 --> 00:16:16.202
Why not a white victim
and a black or Arab killer?


236
00:16:16.408 --> 00:16:19.105
- Anti-white racism?
- You said it's not racism.


237
00:16:19.344 --> 00:16:20.675
You started-.

238
00:16:20.879 --> 00:16:23.007
Calm down, both of you.

239
00:16:23.215 --> 00:16:27.345
It's good to have blacks or Arabs,
like around this table.


240
00:16:27.553 --> 00:16:28.384
What black?

241
00:16:28.587 --> 00:16:30.521
Who do you mean, ma'am?

242
00:16:30.722 --> 00:16:32.884
But we can decide later

243
00:16:33.092 --> 00:16:34.958
if it's a racist crime.

244
00:16:36.228 --> 00:16:37.718
Put a question mark.

245
00:16:37.930 --> 00:16:39.364
I'll do that.

246
00:16:39.565 --> 00:16:41.226
"Racist dimension?"

247
00:16:42.267 --> 00:16:43.962
Antoine, any ideas?

248
00:16:45.838 --> 00:16:47.499
No, not really.

249
00:16:47.706 --> 00:16:52.166
I liked Bouba's idea yesterday
of using the marina.


250
00:16:52.511 --> 00:16:54.377
We're backtracking?

251
00:16:54.746 --> 00:16:56.908
The shipyard was confirmed?

252
00:16:57.116 --> 00:17:00.142
- I thought we agreed...
- We kept saying so.


253
00:17:00.385 --> 00:17:02.410
Don't ask me in that case.

254
00:17:02.921 --> 00:17:05.117
No, go on, express yourself.

255
00:17:05.357 --> 00:17:07.792
Why are you so keen on the marina?

256
00:17:08.227 --> 00:17:09.695
It's not that...

257
00:17:10.429 --> 00:17:13.091
I think it's better for a thriller.

258
00:17:13.298 --> 00:17:15.733
Yacht-owners make good victims.

259
00:17:16.535 --> 00:17:19.163
They're rich, people envy them,

260
00:17:19.371 --> 00:17:22.341
they do all kinds of shady deals...

261
00:17:22.541 --> 00:17:24.703
It makes the town look better.

262
00:17:24.910 --> 00:17:26.571
Drugs and trafficking?

263
00:17:26.778 --> 00:17:28.906
The shipyard's dead now.

264
00:17:29.114 --> 00:17:31.139
- It's history.
- Dead and buried.


265
00:17:31.383 --> 00:17:35.820
All the same,
it's the first thing you see here.


266
00:17:35.988 --> 00:17:37.149
We know that.

267
00:17:37.389 --> 00:17:40.552
Tourists talk about it,
but it's a graveyard.


268
00:17:41.393 --> 00:17:43.691
You can even see it from here.

269
00:17:51.336 --> 00:17:55.705
Rather than get stuck
on the victim or killer's identity,


270
00:17:55.941 --> 00:17:57.409
past or present...

271
00:17:57.910 --> 00:18:00.402
I suggest you write. Simply.

272
00:18:02.314 --> 00:18:04.908
- Write what?
- Whatever you want.


273
00:18:05.117 --> 00:18:06.881
Whatever is easiest.

274
00:18:07.085 --> 00:18:10.851
The description of a place,
character or scene.


275
00:18:11.023 --> 00:18:13.117
Or a personal experience

276
00:18:13.325 --> 00:18:16.124
that could be linked to the story.

277
00:18:16.995 --> 00:18:19.157
You must feel free to write

278
00:18:19.364 --> 00:18:21.856
without focusing on the plot.

279
00:18:22.100 --> 00:18:23.693
I call it “writing around“.

280
00:18:25.337 --> 00:18:26.327
It's not easy.

281
00:18:27.172 --> 00:18:29.106
We're not writers.

282
00:18:29.308 --> 00:18:30.400
Just try.

283
00:18:30.609 --> 00:18:31.576
That's all.

284
00:18:31.777 --> 00:18:33.245
I'm not writing.

285
00:18:35.280 --> 00:18:37.874
Why do this course in that case'?

286
00:18:38.050 --> 00:18:39.347
I had no choice.

287
00:18:39.785 --> 00:18:41.219
That's not true.

288
00:18:41.386 --> 00:18:43.411
You applied to do it.

289
00:18:43.655 --> 00:18:47.853
No, the Job Center told me
I had a course. So I came.


290
00:18:48.060 --> 00:18:49.994
Weren't you glad to be picked'?

291
00:18:50.195 --> 00:18:51.492
It's not the World Cup.

292
00:18:51.964 --> 00:18:53.728
Picked for nothing.

293
00:18:54.299 --> 00:18:57.496
I don't want them to strike me off-.

294
00:18:57.703 --> 00:18:59.000
You can't say that.

295
00:18:59.204 --> 00:19:02.003
The selection process wasn't like that.

296
00:19:03.008 --> 00:19:04.305
You'd prefer what?

297
00:19:04.509 --> 00:19:06.807
Council office work,
cleaning beaches?


298
00:19:07.012 --> 00:19:10.380
It'd be more use.
Think we'll be writers?


299
00:19:10.582 --> 00:19:13.608
Even speaking,
you make spelling mistakes.


300
00:19:14.586 --> 00:19:16.918
I won't make you a writer.

301
00:19:17.155 --> 00:19:19.954
But I'd like us to enjoy

302
00:19:20.158 --> 00:19:23.321
thinking together to build something up.

303
00:19:23.528 --> 00:19:25.053
That's why I'm here.

304
00:19:25.264 --> 00:19:27.255
- That's why?
- Yes.


305
00:19:27.833 --> 00:19:29.927
You're well paid to be here.

306
00:19:30.535 --> 00:19:33.470
Yes, but I could earn more elsewhere.

307
00:19:33.672 --> 00:19:34.969
I couldn't.

308
00:19:36.675 --> 00:19:38.040
Why then?

309
00:19:38.610 --> 00:19:41.443
Why does a writer like you
waste time with us'?


310
00:19:41.680 --> 00:19:43.444
I'm not wasting my time.

311
00:19:43.615 --> 00:19:45.447
It interests me, that's all.

312
00:19:46.051 --> 00:19:49.646
Besides, even it this
may sound pretentious...


313
00:19:52.591 --> 00:19:55.720
I like passing on things I can do.

314
00:19:55.927 --> 00:19:57.861
Thank you, ma'am, really.

315
00:19:58.597 --> 00:20:01.965
Benjamin, I hope
you'll change your mind.


316
00:20:02.768 --> 00:20:05.237
But don't spoil it for the others.

317
00:20:05.771 --> 00:20:08.797
No worries. I'll put in my hours.

318
00:20:09.408 --> 00:20:11.843
Don't ask for more,
I'll be no trouble.


319
00:20:12.444 --> 00:20:13.377
That's all.

320
00:20:16.548 --> 00:20:18.573
For those willing to write,

321
00:20:18.884 --> 00:20:21.353
I suggest you get started.
Try it.


322
00:20:21.887 --> 00:20:25.187
In the shade, the sun,
sitting, lying, whatever...


323
00:20:25.390 --> 00:20:27.882
You need to be comfortable to write.

324
00:20:28.093 --> 00:20:30.061
Try it and we'll see.

325
00:22:07.359 --> 00:22:09.691
Foreigners aren't the problem,

326
00:22:10.562 --> 00:22:13.156
nor the open borders.

327
00:22:15.834 --> 00:22:19.202
No, the problem
is the EU bureaucrats


328
00:22:19.404 --> 00:22:21.372
who opened those borders,

329
00:22:22.007 --> 00:22:25.170
who intended
to make countries lose


330
00:22:25.377 --> 00:22:28.813
more than their sovereignty,
their immunity.


331
00:22:30.749 --> 00:22:32.342
A country without immunity

332
00:22:33.618 --> 00:22:36.781
gradually loses its identity,

333
00:22:37.456 --> 00:22:38.753
its roots,

334
00:22:39.124 --> 00:22:40.285
its culture.

335
00:22:40.525 --> 00:22:42.789
And I mean its true culture,

336
00:22:43.462 --> 00:22:47.729
namely the set of customs
that shape and unite us-.


337
00:22:48.533 --> 00:22:49.466
I don't mean

338
00:22:49.634 --> 00:22:53.400
the shapeless and mind-numbing
mass media.


339
00:22:54.739 --> 00:22:56.070
It's up to us,

340
00:22:56.608 --> 00:23:00.374
the people of our land,
to embody the French spirit


341
00:23:00.779 --> 00:23:03.976
if we don't want
foreign, capitalist powers


342
00:23:04.216 --> 00:23:06.150
to become even more global

343
00:23:06.318 --> 00:23:09.652
and impose
their politically correct agenda.


344
00:23:10.121 --> 00:23:14.251
Of course, we'll come up against
the human-rightist morality


345
00:23:14.459 --> 00:23:16.826
of our right-minded detractors,

346
00:23:17.062 --> 00:23:19.053
but we fight for a people,

347
00:23:19.264 --> 00:23:20.732
a culture

348
00:23:20.932 --> 00:23:24.425
endangered
by galloping cross-fertilization.


349
00:23:24.636 --> 00:23:28.334
We also fight to preserve
European thinking


350
00:23:28.573 --> 00:23:31.565
and its 35,000-year history, no less.

351
00:23:34.913 --> 00:23:37.939
On the coast,
between Marseille and Toulouse,


352
00:23:38.149 --> 00:23:41.949
CNC is one
of the world's leading yards...


353
00:23:42.988 --> 00:23:46.253
The Northern and Mediterranean yards

354
00:23:46.958 --> 00:23:50.121
unite the work of the shipyards
in Dunkirk,


355
00:23:50.328 --> 00:23:52.092
La Seyne and La Ciotat.

356
00:23:52.297 --> 00:23:56.165
...some produce series
of identical ships,


357
00:23:56.368 --> 00:23:57.392
but CNC

358
00:23:57.636 --> 00:24:01.334
uses the skills and quality
of its design office...


359
00:24:51.556 --> 00:24:53.581
After welding and assembly,

360
00:24:54.759 --> 00:24:57.194
we'd organize the launch.

361
00:24:57.395 --> 00:25:01.593
If there were no holes,
no chance of water seeping in,


362
00:25:01.833 --> 00:25:03.460
then we could launch.

363
00:25:03.668 --> 00:25:07.127
So the scenes of waves
flooding the town were here?


364
00:25:07.339 --> 00:25:10.309
Right here or that slipway there.

365
00:25:10.508 --> 00:25:12.704
- Two of them?
- Yes. Here.


366
00:25:13.745 --> 00:25:15.235
The sections went there

367
00:25:15.447 --> 00:25:18.212
and once it was assembled,
we'd remove the door


368
00:25:18.416 --> 00:25:19.850
and let it slide down.

369
00:25:20.051 --> 00:25:21.917
It didn’t hit the wharf

370
00:25:22.253 --> 00:25:26.281
but looked like it would
and made a huge wave.


371
00:25:26.524 --> 00:25:29.892
Whenever there was a launch,
usually at noon,


372
00:25:30.095 --> 00:25:32.792
my dad was soaked to his knees.

373
00:25:36.201 --> 00:25:38.135
10,000 people worked here.

374
00:25:38.303 --> 00:25:40.271
Until the day they said,

375
00:25:40.905 --> 00:25:42.373
"It's all over-"

376
00:25:42.574 --> 00:25:45.066
It really messed our minds up.

377
00:25:45.276 --> 00:25:47.301
50 suicides the first year,

378
00:25:47.545 --> 00:25:50.173
divorces, people turning to drink...

379
00:25:51.950 --> 00:25:55.045
A real tragedy.
And some fought back.


380
00:25:55.253 --> 00:25:57.847
They felt better by fighting-.

381
00:25:58.056 --> 00:26:00.081
They fought back.

382
00:26:00.291 --> 00:26:02.623
- They resisted.
- You occupied it?


383
00:26:02.827 --> 00:26:06.491
Yes, I occupied the yard
and it lasted ten years.


384
00:26:06.731 --> 00:26:10.167
We were up against guys
using tear gas


385
00:26:10.335 --> 00:26:11.302
and clubs.

386
00:26:11.503 --> 00:26:14.029
We fought back and we won.

387
00:26:14.406 --> 00:26:17.535
The site is still industrial

388
00:26:17.742 --> 00:26:19.403
for maritime trades.

389
00:26:20.478 --> 00:26:25.109
It means that people, our children,
can come here to work.


390
00:26:26.484 --> 00:26:29.181
We'll carry on along here.

391
00:26:30.755 --> 00:26:32.245
On with the visit...

392
00:26:34.359 --> 00:26:38.489
They sound like happy memories,
the fight and so on...


393
00:26:38.963 --> 00:26:41.933
They are, even if we suffered a lot.

394
00:26:42.133 --> 00:26:44.261
I had to eat at a shelter.

395
00:26:44.469 --> 00:26:46.801
I got my clothes from there.

396
00:26:47.005 --> 00:26:50.134
Like my colleagues,
I had no money coming in.


397
00:27:23.174 --> 00:27:24.266
It's beautiful.

398
00:27:24.476 --> 00:27:26.001
We've done good work.

399
00:27:26.211 --> 00:27:28.646
Six weeks of renovation.

400
00:27:32.016 --> 00:27:34.713
- How long is it?
- 32 metres.


401
00:27:36.087 --> 00:27:37.555
Can I come on board?

402
00:27:38.356 --> 00:27:40.120
You've got a nerve!

403
00:27:41.826 --> 00:27:43.521
Come on, then.

404
00:27:44.562 --> 00:27:46.360
- Thanks.
- Sure.


405
00:28:40.485 --> 00:28:43.079
Like I told your pal,
don't make a mess!


406
00:28:53.164 --> 00:28:54.359
They call this luxury.

407
00:28:54.599 --> 00:28:56.567
I'm totally into it.

408
00:28:56.768 --> 00:28:59.931
- You could never afford this.
- We can dream.


409
00:29:00.438 --> 00:29:02.463
Not even a weekend rental.

410
00:29:02.674 --> 00:29:04.802
Malika, sit up. Show respect.

411
00:29:05.009 --> 00:29:08.707
This won't happen again.
Let me enjoy it.


412
00:29:10.014 --> 00:29:12.642
I could live on a yacht like this.

413
00:29:13.184 --> 00:29:15.278
You'd get seasick.

414
00:29:15.486 --> 00:29:17.580
Moor in a pine forest...

415
00:29:17.789 --> 00:29:19.484
So buy a caravan.

416
00:29:21.659 --> 00:29:24.185
This suits me as a setting.

417
00:29:24.429 --> 00:29:27.558
Imagine a corpse on a yacht
in the yard.


418
00:29:27.765 --> 00:29:28.755
Not bad.

419
00:29:28.967 --> 00:29:32.426
We get our yard
and you, your billionaire's yacht.


420
00:29:33.605 --> 00:29:37.599
It fits in with Bouba's idea.
Shot in his bath like Scarface.


421
00:29:37.809 --> 00:29:39.436
What about the past,

422
00:29:39.644 --> 00:29:41.078
the strikes, the fight?

423
00:29:41.279 --> 00:29:44.305
So a worker comes back,

424
00:29:44.515 --> 00:29:47.109
to kill an American billionaire.
A rabid Communist?


425
00:29:47.318 --> 00:29:48.615
My grandad was a Communist.

426
00:29:48.820 --> 00:29:53.087
There's your killer.
An old Communist Arab in a wheelchair.


427
00:29:53.291 --> 00:29:55.385
My grandad isn't handicapped.

428
00:29:55.693 --> 00:29:57.991
Imagine him coming onto the boat.

429
00:29:58.963 --> 00:30:00.795
"Where's the Yank to waste?"

430
00:30:01.866 --> 00:30:03.960
Joking aside, we won't keep it all,

431
00:30:04.168 --> 00:30:05.966
but this is interesting.

432
00:30:06.170 --> 00:30:07.660
Malika's idea

433
00:30:07.872 --> 00:30:11.240
of bringing in
the town's Communist past is good-.


434
00:30:11.576 --> 00:30:15.069
If you want a political novel,
not a thriller, say so-.


435
00:30:15.313 --> 00:30:16.974
I'm easy either way.

436
00:30:17.181 --> 00:30:18.342
You're easy'?

437
00:30:18.549 --> 00:30:20.483
Who'll believe that?

438
00:30:20.685 --> 00:30:22.881
It's not how I see it but...

439
00:30:24.088 --> 00:30:27.456
And a thriller
can have a political side.


440
00:30:27.692 --> 00:30:28.818
It often does.

441
00:30:29.027 --> 00:30:31.121
Talking politics makes him uneasy.

442
00:30:31.329 --> 00:30:33.821
Bullshit. It doesn't interest me.

443
00:30:34.032 --> 00:30:36.160
We know what that means.

444
00:30:36.834 --> 00:30:37.995
Shut your mouth!

445
00:30:39.704 --> 00:30:41.570
- 1-0.
- Game over.


446
00:30:50.014 --> 00:30:54.508
---But a real, crude
and asserted form of violence-.


447
00:30:55.086 --> 00:30:59.523
How can a young woman like you
write such awful things?


448
00:31:00.291 --> 00:31:02.157
Maybe you don't know me.

449
00:31:03.962 --> 00:31:05.589
Violence, then.

450
00:31:05.797 --> 00:31:08.391
But also a lot of eroticism.

451
00:31:08.599 --> 00:31:11.034
An eroticism I'd call

452
00:31:11.235 --> 00:31:12.725
almost masculine.

453
00:31:13.237 --> 00:31:16.605
Well, the two main characters are men...

454
00:31:16.808 --> 00:31:18.435
Two brothers, in fact.

455
00:31:18.943 --> 00:31:22.379
There's a strong hint of incest.

456
00:31:22.580 --> 00:31:24.742
Antoine! Come and eat!

457
00:31:25.650 --> 00:31:26.617
Coming!

458
00:31:26.818 --> 00:31:28.513
Violence and desire rise.

459
00:31:28.753 --> 00:31:30.721
When you say that, my book

460
00:31:30.922 --> 00:31:32.287
sounds terrible.

461
00:31:33.224 --> 00:31:35.852
That's not what I meant to say.

462
00:31:36.060 --> 00:31:39.894
I don't see the relationship's
incestuous side.


463
00:31:40.098 --> 00:31:42.863
People imagine desire between brothers,

464
00:31:43.234 --> 00:31:46.397
but I think the eroticism comes from me,

465
00:31:46.738 --> 00:31:49.537
from how I see them as a woman.

466
00:31:51.175 --> 00:31:52.665
What interested me...

467
00:31:53.745 --> 00:31:57.045
- this may sound trite -
but I wanted


468
00:31:57.248 --> 00:32:00.274
to describe two very close brothers

469
00:32:00.485 --> 00:32:02.476
who grow to hate each other

470
00:32:03.087 --> 00:32:05.522
because each one feels

471
00:32:05.690 --> 00:32:07.818
the other dictates his thoughts.

472
00:32:08.026 --> 00:32:09.516
In the end,

473
00:32:09.761 --> 00:32:13.220
no one can tell
the ventriloquist from the dummy.


474
00:32:13.431 --> 00:32:14.694
Is that clear'?

475
00:32:24.709 --> 00:32:26.336
It's me. I'm off to bed.

476
00:32:26.978 --> 00:32:28.241
Give me a kiss.

477
00:32:36.054 --> 00:32:37.249
What is it?

478
00:32:37.855 --> 00:32:40.324
It's by the lady I'm working with.

479
00:32:41.793 --> 00:32:42.954
Let me see-.

480
00:32:47.899 --> 00:32:50.493
Olivia Déjazet. Lost Wager.

481
00:32:50.701 --> 00:32:51.862
Is it good?

482
00:32:52.403 --> 00:32:53.666
Not bad.

483
00:32:58.676 --> 00:33:00.371
- Is that her?
- Yeah.


484
00:33:00.578 --> 00:33:01.875
She's pretty.

485
00:33:02.080 --> 00:33:03.707
Thanks to the photo.

486
00:33:07.251 --> 00:33:09.219
It's late. Get to bed now.

487
00:33:09.821 --> 00:33:10.811
A kiss.

488
00:33:15.226 --> 00:33:16.557
Good night.

489
00:33:26.871 --> 00:33:29.033
- Déjazet.
- ls she famous?


490
00:33:29.240 --> 00:33:31.368
You bet. Are you stupid?

491
00:33:31.576 --> 00:33:33.203
She's written a lot.

492
00:33:33.411 --> 00:33:35.573
- She's charming.
- Very nice.


493
00:33:37.181 --> 00:33:38.945
I'd write with her!

494
00:33:42.253 --> 00:33:43.414
She's chill!

495
00:33:43.754 --> 00:33:46.621
She can borrow my big pen anytime.

496
00:33:46.858 --> 00:33:47.950
Horn dog.

497
00:33:48.126 --> 00:33:51.152
She's the snooty Champs
-Elysées type.

498
00:33:52.029 --> 00:33:54.794
It's a gala.
She's normal otherwise.


499
00:33:54.966 --> 00:33:56.263
Antoine!

500
00:33:56.467 --> 00:33:58.094
Defending her'? In love?

501
00:33:58.636 --> 00:33:59.660
Shut your trap!

502
00:33:59.904 --> 00:34:01.269
He's in love!

503
00:34:02.940 --> 00:34:04.430
Teddy, take a look.

504
00:34:05.610 --> 00:34:07.078
She's still hot!

505
00:34:07.545 --> 00:34:09.536
I never said she'd had it.

506
00:34:10.248 --> 00:34:12.273
Nice, plunging backline.

507
00:34:12.483 --> 00:34:15.009
- Pissed off'?
- Nah, screw that.


508
00:34:15.253 --> 00:34:18.348
- She hangs out in town?
- Not her type.


509
00:34:19.056 --> 00:34:21.582
Too bad, I'd buy her a pastis.

510
00:34:22.426 --> 00:34:25.225
- More than a pastis!
- Quit the macho act.


511
00:34:25.429 --> 00:34:28.262
- Never seen a girl before?
- Cut it out.


512
00:34:29.600 --> 00:34:31.932
- I wasted you!
- That hurt!


513
00:34:32.136 --> 00:34:33.570
Thought you'd beat me'?

514
00:34:33.771 --> 00:34:36.138
I don't train all day!

515
00:34:36.340 --> 00:34:38.365
- I have stuff to do-
- She's pissed off-.


516
00:34:38.609 --> 00:34:41.909
- She's pissed off...
- Enough. Look at this mess.


517
00:34:42.113 --> 00:34:43.581
Steph, take over.

518
00:34:45.249 --> 00:34:46.239
I take the winner.

519
00:34:46.584 --> 00:34:48.712
- Want to help?
- Sure.


520
00:34:48.920 --> 00:34:51.582
- Take stuff to the kitchen.
- Ok.


521
00:34:54.025 --> 00:34:55.959
He's not doing the dishes!

522
00:34:56.160 --> 00:34:58.652
- It's nothing, OK.
- Pussy!


523
00:35:00.131 --> 00:35:01.929
You're pissing me off-.

524
00:35:03.167 --> 00:35:04.601
Some music...

525
00:35:10.841 --> 00:35:12.366
What's with you'?

526
00:35:12.610 --> 00:35:14.476
Move, I can't see!

527
00:35:15.947 --> 00:35:18.075
What are you doing?

528
00:35:18.282 --> 00:35:20.478
Shit, I was fucking winning.

529
00:36:05.863 --> 00:36:07.388
What's up, kiddo'?

530
00:36:11.869 --> 00:36:13.860
A quick dance, then bed, ok'?

531
00:36:15.039 --> 00:36:17.064
Promise? Gimme five.

532
00:36:17.775 --> 00:36:18.640
Let's go.

533
00:36:36.927 --> 00:36:38.053
Stop it!

534
00:37:37.254 --> 00:37:41.191
"That day, thousands came
to see the tanker launched.


535
00:37:42.193 --> 00:37:43.957
"In the dry dock,

536
00:37:44.161 --> 00:37:46.960
"workers were freeing the steel monster.

537
00:37:47.698 --> 00:37:49.632
"A creaking sound is heard

538
00:37:49.834 --> 00:37:52.826
“and the black hulk
slides along its track.


539
00:37:53.037 --> 00:37:55.233
"It descends in slow motion.

540
00:37:55.973 --> 00:37:58.408
"On the deck, workers wave flags

541
00:37:58.609 --> 00:38:01.101
"and all the boats sound their horns.

542
00:38:01.979 --> 00:38:03.140
"On hitting the water,

543
00:38:03.347 --> 00:38:06.874
"the ship makes a wave
that reaches the shore.


544
00:38:07.885 --> 00:38:11.082
"The young people who are too close
are splashed and laugh.


545
00:38:11.322 --> 00:38:12.414
"The town cheers.

546
00:38:12.623 --> 00:38:16.958
"Are they applauding the majestic ship
or the workers for their labor?


547
00:38:17.161 --> 00:38:21.530
"The latter proudly embrace,
gazing at the ocean-going giant.“


548
00:38:22.733 --> 00:38:24.326
There, that's all.

549
00:38:24.535 --> 00:38:27.470
That's good, Malika.
Vibrant, well constructed...


550
00:38:27.671 --> 00:38:28.638
Well done.

551
00:38:29.140 --> 00:38:32.405
It was like being there. Bravo.

552
00:38:32.576 --> 00:38:35.011
I asked my dad.
He was little but...


553
00:38:35.212 --> 00:38:36.407
I took notes.

554
00:38:36.647 --> 00:38:39.173
See, it's not that hard.

555
00:38:40.184 --> 00:38:41.345
Who else?

556
00:38:44.355 --> 00:38:45.447
Boubacar?

557
00:38:45.923 --> 00:38:50.224
Can you give me a couple of days?
What I wrote sucks.


558
00:38:50.428 --> 00:38:52.863
A couple of days? Not a week.

559
00:38:58.669 --> 00:39:00.364
So, who's ready'?

560
00:39:02.406 --> 00:39:03.567
I have something,

561
00:39:03.774 --> 00:39:08.041
but it's not historical like Malika.
It's like the start oi a novel.


562
00:39:08.245 --> 00:39:09.735
We're listening.

563
00:39:17.755 --> 00:39:21.123
"As usual, he had
to struggle to get up.

564
00:39:21.358 --> 00:39:24.521
“He nearly forgot
he had finished at the yard.


565
00:39:24.728 --> 00:39:27.220
"The temp work was over.

566
00:39:27.431 --> 00:39:30.890
“He had put
the finishing touches to the yacht


567
00:39:31.101 --> 00:39:32.899
"refurbished by the 25 workers.

568
00:39:33.103 --> 00:39:35.800
"He went to the dry dock.
With a terrific din,


569
00:39:36.373 --> 00:39:38.740
"the crane moved the yacht to the water.

570
00:39:38.943 --> 00:39:40.240
"Everyone cheered.

571
00:39:40.444 --> 00:39:43.607
"His colleagues
and the engineer who never spoke to him.


572
00:39:43.814 --> 00:39:47.648
"The yacht's owner was there,
an emir in a white djellaba.


573
00:39:47.885 --> 00:39:49.819
"He joined the others on board.

574
00:39:49.987 --> 00:39:52.251
"His blood was pounding in his ears.

575
00:39:52.456 --> 00:39:55.551
"He no longer knew why he was there.

576
00:39:56.126 --> 00:39:58.094
"Then the engine rumbled to life.

577
00:39:58.295 --> 00:40:01.595
“Slowly, as in a dream,
the boat left the harbor.


578
00:40:01.799 --> 00:40:03.130
"Everyone was smiling.

579
00:40:03.334 --> 00:40:06.634
"The engineer went round,
congratulating the team.


580
00:40:06.837 --> 00:40:08.532
"He finally reached him.

581
00:40:09.106 --> 00:40:11.097
"He held out a spotless hand.

582
00:40:11.308 --> 00:40:12.469
"That did ii.

583
00:40:12.676 --> 00:40:16.544
"He felt he was in a black hole,
speeding towards the abyss.


584
00:40:16.780 --> 00:40:19.545
"He opened his bag,
took out an AK-47,


585
00:40:19.750 --> 00:40:22.515
"and, before anyone could react,
opened fire.


586
00:40:22.686 --> 00:40:26.486
"Nothing could stop him.
The blood seemed to urge him on.


587
00:40:27.291 --> 00:40:29.089
"The boat headed out to sea.

588
00:40:29.293 --> 00:40:31.955
"No emotion. His mind's blank.
He kills.


589
00:40:32.162 --> 00:40:34.927
"The last one is the other temp worker.

590
00:40:35.866 --> 00:40:40.201
"The young man begs in terror,
a terror he refuses to see.


591
00:40:40.437 --> 00:40:42.235
"So he fires one last time.

592
00:40:42.840 --> 00:40:45.866
“He looks around,
as if discovering the scene.


593
00:40:46.110 --> 00:40:50.547
“The deck is a pool of red.
Steaming blood covers the white seats.


594
00:40:50.714 --> 00:40:54.082
"The air smells of death,
less sickening than expected.


595
00:40:54.318 --> 00:40:56.616
"Spattered with blood and brains,

596
00:40:56.820 --> 00:40:59.653
"he steps over the corpses
and the dying.


597
00:40:59.857 --> 00:41:03.794
"Ignoring their pain, he goes
to the helm and, with true pride,


598
00:41:03.994 --> 00:41:07.862
"steers the ghost ship
to a destination he does not even know."


599
00:41:10.367 --> 00:41:12.859
Your brain's fried, man?

600
00:41:13.404 --> 00:41:14.599
What's up?

601
00:41:14.838 --> 00:41:16.829
You get hard writing that?

602
00:41:17.374 --> 00:41:21.038
It's a crime thriller.
Not some floppy romance.


603
00:41:21.245 --> 00:41:23.179
- What?
- Soppy, not floppy.


604
00:41:23.380 --> 00:41:24.506
Same difference.

605
00:41:24.715 --> 00:41:27.377
You're a fucking hypocrite.

606
00:41:27.585 --> 00:41:29.610
You're into Scarface.

607
00:41:30.154 --> 00:41:32.623
It's way more violent than this.

608
00:41:33.390 --> 00:41:35.154
He thinks it's Scarface...

609
00:41:35.359 --> 00:41:38.056
- We're waiting for yours.
- Don't worry.


610
00:41:38.596 --> 00:41:41.861
- It's not bad...
- So what's the problem?


611
00:41:42.066 --> 00:41:45.730
You go way too far.
You can't write stuff like that.


612
00:41:45.936 --> 00:41:48.371
We don't decree
what we can write or not.


613
00:41:48.572 --> 00:41:51.598
- Does he realize the limits?
- I don't know.


614
00:41:52.543 --> 00:41:54.671
Do you see what she means?

615
00:41:55.346 --> 00:41:58.941
The idea of a red line
that maybe you crossed.


616
00:41:59.717 --> 00:42:00.741
I dunno.

617
00:42:00.951 --> 00:42:03.977
After that, you've nothing left to say.

618
00:42:04.221 --> 00:42:06.986
What can you write after? It's sick.

619
00:42:07.191 --> 00:42:08.158
It's sick?

620
00:42:08.359 --> 00:42:09.690
You find it sick?

621
00:42:09.893 --> 00:42:11.884
What your pals did wasn't?

622
00:42:12.262 --> 00:42:15.232
- At the Bataclan...
- My pals?


623
00:42:15.432 --> 00:42:17.958
Quit provoking me, dickhead!

624
00:42:18.202 --> 00:42:20.068
Calm down, Fadi!

625
00:42:20.270 --> 00:42:21.601
Calm down, OK!

626
00:42:21.805 --> 00:42:23.432
You defend a racist!

627
00:42:23.641 --> 00:42:25.268
I'm not defending him!

628
00:42:26.076 --> 00:42:28.511
We're here to talk and debate,

629
00:42:28.712 --> 00:42:29.804
not trade insults.

630
00:42:29.980 --> 00:42:33.075
He insults all Muslims
and you're on his side.


631
00:42:33.784 --> 00:42:36.446
I'm not.
I don't want to hear that here.


632
00:42:36.920 --> 00:42:38.081
Is that clear'?

633
00:42:40.457 --> 00:42:41.424
Listen,

634
00:42:41.625 --> 00:42:43.218
I don't agree with Antoine,

635
00:42:43.427 --> 00:42:46.055
but maybe we should discuss it.

636
00:42:46.397 --> 00:42:47.523
Discuss what?

637
00:42:47.731 --> 00:42:49.893
Radicalization and all that.

638
00:42:50.100 --> 00:42:52.626
- A Jihadi story now'?
- Why not'?


639
00:42:52.836 --> 00:42:55.828
Those jerks won't dictate what we write!

640
00:42:56.240 --> 00:42:58.732
You can't just say they're jerks.

641
00:42:58.942 --> 00:43:01.468
They've changed our lives and...

642
00:43:01.912 --> 00:43:05.109
when I go out,
it's in the back of my mind.


643
00:43:05.315 --> 00:43:06.339
Hear him'?

644
00:43:06.917 --> 00:43:10.410
More folks die on the roads
than in attacks.


645
00:43:10.621 --> 00:43:12.385
And you play the wimp?

646
00:43:13.323 --> 00:43:16.315
With all the stuff on TV,
I understand him-.


647
00:43:16.527 --> 00:43:18.655
A mall reminds you of the Bataclan.

648
00:43:19.129 --> 00:43:22.292
A white truck reminds you of Nice.

649
00:43:22.499 --> 00:43:26.197
We're not at war.
War's in Syria.


650
00:43:26.437 --> 00:43:29.771
Those things happen everywhere.
Tunis, Paris...


651
00:43:30.174 --> 00:43:33.041
In Oslo,
it was a blue-eyed blond guy like you.


652
00:43:33.277 --> 00:43:34.574
It's pretty clear

653
00:43:34.778 --> 00:43:38.806
this is the first discussion
that concerns us all.


654
00:43:39.016 --> 00:43:40.882
I'm not interested.

655
00:43:41.552 --> 00:43:44.817
I agree it's a very sensitive subject,

656
00:43:45.456 --> 00:43:47.151
but we should tackle it.

657
00:43:47.357 --> 00:43:51.658
You're not an Arab.
Look at him. Lumping us all together.


658
00:43:51.862 --> 00:43:53.853
I bet his killer's Arab.

659
00:43:54.064 --> 00:43:55.327
Not necessarily.

660
00:43:55.532 --> 00:43:59.230
40% of those radicalized
are white French converts.


661
00:43:59.470 --> 00:44:00.665
Who'll believe that?

662
00:44:00.871 --> 00:44:04.068
White, green or yellow,
he'll be an Arab for people.


663
00:44:04.308 --> 00:44:07.107
Hold on, drop the politics.

664
00:44:07.311 --> 00:44:10.611
I wrote an action scene
and you're going haywire.


665
00:44:10.814 --> 00:44:12.111
That's just it.

666
00:44:12.316 --> 00:44:14.910
You don't seem to give a shit.

667
00:44:15.085 --> 00:44:18.020
- You act smart, writing gory stuff---
- So?


668
00:44:18.222 --> 00:44:19.212
You can't.

669
00:44:19.423 --> 00:44:21.016
- You decide?
- What'll you do?


670
00:44:21.492 --> 00:44:24.120
What'll I do? Have you lost it?

671
00:44:24.328 --> 00:44:26.524
Shut your mouth! Stop smiling!

672
00:44:28.699 --> 00:44:31.168
Put your hand down!
Don't threaten me!


673
00:44:31.568 --> 00:44:33.093
I'll rip your head off!

674
00:44:38.108 --> 00:44:40.133
Boubacar, sit down.

675
00:44:40.377 --> 00:44:41.811
Let me speak-.

676
00:44:42.012 --> 00:44:44.879
- Illegal.
- You're the fucking illegal.


677
00:44:45.282 --> 00:44:47.614
I'm more French than you, man!

678
00:44:48.919 --> 00:44:50.045
Finished?

679
00:44:50.420 --> 00:44:52.218
- Can I speak?
- Speak.


680
00:44:53.857 --> 00:44:55.518
This may shock you.

681
00:44:55.926 --> 00:44:58.588
For a first draft, 
Antoine's text

682
00:44:58.796 --> 00:45:00.457
is quite well written.

683
00:45:04.868 --> 00:45:06.029
Now, Antoine,

684
00:45:06.904 --> 00:45:10.568
while cruelty may attract me,
I agree with Boubacar.


685
00:45:10.774 --> 00:45:14.438
You show
a little too much complacency.


686
00:45:15.579 --> 00:45:17.206
What's complacency?

687
00:45:18.549 --> 00:45:20.711
It's like you're enjoying it,

688
00:45:20.918 --> 00:45:22.886
as if it gets you “hard“.

689
00:45:23.620 --> 00:45:27.579
- Have you lost it too'?
- You know what I mean.


690
00:45:27.791 --> 00:45:30.590
You tell me to write,
then say it's not that!


691
00:45:30.794 --> 00:45:32.057
Quit playing the victim!

692
00:45:32.262 --> 00:45:34.060
We don't want to write that!

693
00:45:34.264 --> 00:45:37.427
I don't complain
about your dumb noble stuff.


694
00:45:37.634 --> 00:45:39.500
So what's the rule here?

695
00:45:39.736 --> 00:45:42.068
There's a lot of confusion.

696
00:45:42.272 --> 00:45:46.470
It's not fair
to call Malika's text "noble".


697
00:45:47.177 --> 00:45:51.444
Not all positive feelings
are noble feelings.


698
00:45:51.648 --> 00:45:54.447
- You others think...
- We have names.


699
00:45:54.785 --> 00:45:56.879
- I know, Fadi.
- We're not animals.


700
00:45:57.087 --> 00:45:59.579
I don't respect you?

701
00:45:59.790 --> 00:46:01.315
Say what you want to say.

702
00:46:03.594 --> 00:46:08.031
You seem to think that the author
necessarily agrees with his characters.


703
00:46:08.198 --> 00:46:11.498
If so, we'd need to ban

704
00:46:11.702 --> 00:46:14.569
and lock up all thriller writers.

705
00:46:15.505 --> 00:46:18.770
Like it or not,
you can describe a massacre


706
00:46:19.142 --> 00:46:22.635
without being a killer,
or a racist without being racist.


707
00:46:22.846 --> 00:46:25.816
Etienne was the one
who spoke about Jihads!


708
00:46:26.016 --> 00:46:28.678
- Let me finish.
- So speak!


709
00:46:30.787 --> 00:46:33.916
In fiction,
you can describe a way of thinking


710
00:46:34.124 --> 00:46:36.058
in order to denounce it.

711
00:46:36.226 --> 00:46:38.320
That is the power of art.

712
00:46:39.563 --> 00:46:40.724
Do you follow'?

713
00:46:49.139 --> 00:46:51.938
What he wrote isn't the problem,
you know it.


714
00:47:57.307 --> 00:47:58.433
I want to dive in.

715
00:47:58.642 --> 00:48:02.169
Well, the sea's waiting for you
with open arms.


716
00:48:05.649 --> 00:48:06.673
You scared me!

717
00:48:08.552 --> 00:48:11.419
Sorry, I didn't know you were here.

718
00:48:12.289 --> 00:48:13.654
I was just going.

719
00:48:15.258 --> 00:48:17.522
We're not chasing you off?

720
00:48:17.728 --> 00:48:19.196
No, I was going.

721
00:48:22.766 --> 00:48:25.292
Boris, my publisher. Antoine...

722
00:48:26.470 --> 00:48:27.413
- Hello.
- Hi, Antoine.


723
00:48:27.437 --> 00:48:28.199
- Hello.
- Hi, Antoine.


724
00:48:33.977 --> 00:48:35.172
Feeling better?

725
00:48:36.813 --> 00:48:38.474
Fine, I have no problem.

726
00:48:39.649 --> 00:48:41.242
We can talk about it.

727
00:48:41.785 --> 00:48:43.116
Everything's fine.

728
00:48:45.756 --> 00:48:46.951
Enjoy your swim.

729
00:48:47.824 --> 00:48:49.121
See you tomorrow.

730
00:49:46.383 --> 00:49:47.873
Lunch tomorrow?

731
00:49:49.352 --> 00:49:50.217
Sure.

732
00:49:51.888 --> 00:49:52.498
- Are you angry?
- No.


733
00:49:52.522 --> 00:49:53.853
- Are you angry?
- No.


734
00:49:55.258 --> 00:49:56.350
Call me?

735
00:49:57.928 --> 00:49:59.362
Have a good evening.

736
00:51:39.296 --> 00:51:40.991
Can't you move faster?

737
00:51:41.765 --> 00:51:42.926
Gimme a break.

738
00:51:44.134 --> 00:51:45.226
Shit---...

739
00:51:46.436 --> 00:51:46.612
Nearly there.

740
00:51:46.636 --> 00:51:47.603
Nearly there.

741
00:51:49.839 --> 00:51:51.637
Is this Baghdad or what?

742
00:51:51.841 --> 00:51:55.675
Shut the fuck up!
They spot us, we're in deep shit!


743
00:51:58.114 --> 00:52:00.626
He's freaking out. Relax, man.

744
00:52:00.650 --> 00:52:01.194
He's freaking out. Relax, man.

745
00:52:01.218 --> 00:52:02.310
What's that?

746
00:52:03.520 --> 00:52:04.510
The wolf.

747
00:52:06.890 --> 00:52:08.984
Flashlights off now!

748
00:52:22.539 --> 00:52:24.530
Shit, how many are there?

749
00:52:34.884 --> 00:52:37.649
- You could hit them tor real'?
- No sweat.


750
00:52:37.854 --> 00:52:40.323
- You need to know how.
- It takes practice.


751
00:52:40.523 --> 00:52:41.957
Give it here.

752
00:52:44.427 --> 00:52:46.555
Breathing's what matters most.

753
00:52:47.764 --> 00:52:49.528
He's wasted.

754
00:52:50.100 --> 00:52:53.195
You should've taken pills
for the shakes.


755
00:52:53.403 --> 00:52:55.394
Quit hassling him...

756
00:52:55.605 --> 00:52:56.766
Shut your mouth.

757
00:52:57.941 --> 00:53:00.740
- It's not easy from here.
- Right.


758
00:53:08.084 --> 00:53:09.210
Wish I could.

759
00:53:09.419 --> 00:53:10.909
You said it, man.

760
00:53:21.798 --> 00:53:22.959
Want some?

761
00:54:27.764 --> 00:54:28.526
Seasick?

762
00:54:28.698 --> 00:54:30.132
Shit, I can't see!

763
00:54:33.937 --> 00:54:35.029
Hey, guys»-

764
00:54:35.505 --> 00:54:36.870
Great place, huh?

765
00:54:38.208 --> 00:54:39.403
It's nice at night.

766
00:54:39.642 --> 00:54:42.270
This is our place, man.

767
00:54:45.548 --> 00:54:46.982
Keep it off me-.

768
00:54:47.183 --> 00:54:48.344
- Want some?
- No.


769
00:54:48.551 --> 00:54:50.417
We'll see if you don't!

770
00:54:53.022 --> 00:54:54.512
Hold him!

771
00:55:00.897 --> 00:55:02.558
Think it's funny, do you'?

772
00:55:07.904 --> 00:55:09.531
It's OK. The next one.

773
00:55:09.739 --> 00:55:11.104
Second shot.

774
00:55:11.908 --> 00:55:15.071
Don't get too stressed.
Just take aim.


775
00:55:17.847 --> 00:55:19.337
You're useless.

776
00:55:19.549 --> 00:55:20.326
I'll show you how.

777
00:55:20.350 --> 00:55:21.340
I'll show you how.

778
00:55:22.852 --> 00:55:24.650
Watch and admire.

779
00:55:29.025 --> 00:55:31.960
Who's the boss?
Come on, cuz, you now.


780
00:55:32.595 --> 00:55:33.562
Here.

781
00:55:35.231 --> 00:55:36.426
Extend your arm.

782
00:55:36.866 --> 00:55:39.233
- Breathe...
- Playing the sheriff?


783
00:55:39.436 --> 00:55:40.733
- And shoot.
- Hold on.


784
00:55:40.937 --> 00:55:43.235
- He'll do it, you'll see.
- He won't.


785
00:55:43.440 --> 00:55:45.534
- He's a loser.
- He's good.


786
00:55:49.379 --> 00:55:51.006
He's good, OK.

787
00:55:51.214 --> 00:55:53.581
- Practice.
- He was lucky.


788
00:55:53.783 --> 00:55:56.081
I expected more of a recoil...

789
00:55:56.619 --> 00:55:57.882
You got lucky.

790
00:55:58.087 --> 00:55:59.418
You got lucky.

791
00:56:02.392 --> 00:56:02.868
- What did I say?
- Hold on.


792
00:56:02.892 --> 00:56:04.326
- What did I say?
- Hold on.


793
00:56:05.228 --> 00:56:06.753
Beginner's luck.

794
00:56:07.597 --> 00:56:08.860
Call it quits!

795
00:56:22.111 --> 00:56:23.237
That's good.

796
00:56:23.580 --> 00:56:24.775
She freaked out.

797
00:56:29.986 --> 00:56:31.351
What are you doing?

798
00:56:31.988 --> 00:56:35.151
- Having a dip.
- It's too cold. You're nuts.


799
00:56:35.391 --> 00:56:36.916
Let him strip for us.

800
00:56:37.961 --> 00:56:39.952
Go for it, cuz.

801
00:56:40.330 --> 00:56:41.627
Want a strip?

802
00:56:51.508 --> 00:56:54.205
- He's crazy!
- Totally wild!


803
00:56:55.512 --> 00:56:57.674
Come back, Antoine, we love you!

804
00:57:03.253 --> 00:57:04.721
I've done a portrait.

805
00:57:04.921 --> 00:57:07.947
We have the setting: the yacht.
We have a lot.


806
00:57:08.691 --> 00:57:10.853
As for the investigator,

807
00:57:11.094 --> 00:57:12.858
she should be local.

808
00:57:13.029 --> 00:57:13.939
All I said was that it's too vague.

809
00:57:13.963 --> 00:57:16.125
All I said was that it's too vague.

810
00:57:18.368 --> 00:57:19.733
I was thinking about

811
00:57:19.969 --> 00:57:21.903
our guide at the yard.

812
00:57:22.105 --> 00:57:23.595
- Ronaldo.
- Rinaldi.


813
00:57:24.974 --> 00:57:26.135
Rinaldi.

814
00:57:28.211 --> 00:57:28.454
It'd be a surprise
if he was the killer.

815
00:57:28.478 --> 00:57:32.415
It'd be a surprise
if he was the killer.

816
00:57:32.615 --> 00:57:34.208
No one would expect it.

817
00:57:34.384 --> 00:57:37.877
Because it'd never happen
in real life, right?


818
00:57:38.121 --> 00:57:39.646
No, it's a good idea.

819
00:57:39.856 --> 00:57:42.468
An old worker
who hates what the yard has become,


820
00:57:42.492 --> 00:57:43.152
An old worker
who hates what the yard has become,


821
00:57:43.359 --> 00:57:47.523
seeing them build rich guys' yachts,
no more pride...


822
00:57:47.730 --> 00:57:49.698
I suggested that before.

823
00:57:50.567 --> 00:57:52.729
Imagine workers taking up arms.

824
00:57:52.969 --> 00:57:54.960
Exactly what I suggested.

825
00:57:55.371 --> 00:57:56.482
Be glad we picked your idea.

826
00:57:56.506 --> 00:57:57.598
Be glad we picked your idea.

827
00:57:57.807 --> 00:58:00.276
It reminds me
of my grandad and his pals.


828
00:58:00.476 --> 00:58:03.912
It was a while
since you mentioned Grandpa.


829
00:58:04.080 --> 00:58:05.912
Imagine the old men.

830
00:58:06.149 --> 00:58:10.108
They meet and get mad
about the yard's situation.


831
00:58:10.320 --> 00:58:10.996
How it's declined,
with guys who could build


832
00:58:11.020 --> 00:58:12.920
How it's declined,
with guys who could build


833
00:58:13.089 --> 00:58:15.717
250-metre boats being told,

834
00:58:16.159 --> 00:58:18.287
"Hands off, it's luxury work."

835
00:58:18.494 --> 00:58:19.984
So they talk about it.

836
00:58:20.196 --> 00:58:22.995
I was thinking that Rinaldi,
our character,


837
00:58:23.199 --> 00:58:25.010
could blow a fuse one night
or drink too much


838
00:58:25.034 --> 00:58:26.900
could blow a fuse one night
or drink too much


839
00:58:27.103 --> 00:58:29.868
and ice a billionaire, by accident.

840
00:58:30.073 --> 00:58:31.598
- By accident?
- Yeah.


841
00:58:31.841 --> 00:58:34.173
- He's not a killer then.
- He is.


842
00:58:34.377 --> 00:58:36.812
I think it'd be interesting

843
00:58:37.013 --> 00:58:38.674
if he wants to kill

844
00:58:39.582 --> 00:58:42.244
and his only motive
is the need to kill.

845
00:58:43.753 --> 00:58:46.415
Are you nuts?
You don't kill like that.


846
00:58:46.756 --> 00:58:47.746
It happens.

847
00:58:47.957 --> 00:58:50.949
You went haywire last time,
but at the Bataclan...


848
00:58:51.194 --> 00:58:52.184
Not again!

849
00:58:52.528 --> 00:58:53.538
Let me explain!

850
00:58:53.563 --> 00:58:54.155
Let me explain!

851
00:58:54.364 --> 00:58:55.798
Let him speak.

852
00:58:57.433 --> 00:58:58.457
At the Bataclan,

853
00:58:58.968 --> 00:59:02.927
they said they did it
because music is Satan's trap,


854
00:59:03.139 --> 00:59:05.164
France waged war in Syria...

855
00:59:05.408 --> 00:59:06.842
But I think

856
00:59:07.410 --> 00:59:08.053
they just wanted to shoot people.

857
00:59:08.077 --> 00:59:10.375
They just wanted to shoot people.

858
00:59:10.747 --> 00:59:13.842
They were gonna die,
so it was a good way to go.


859
00:59:14.050 --> 00:59:16.849
You're scary,
you seem to understand them.


860
00:59:17.053 --> 00:59:19.545
I'm not saying I understand them.

861
00:59:19.756 --> 00:59:22.067
I can just imagine wanting to kill.

862
00:59:22.091 --> 00:59:22.683
I can just imagine wanting to kill.

863
00:59:22.892 --> 00:59:24.485
Bullshit. Shut up.

864
00:59:24.661 --> 00:59:27.096
Not happy'? I'm defending them.

865
00:59:27.630 --> 00:59:29.496
You say that cos I'm Muslim?

866
00:59:30.066 --> 00:59:31.591
Happy with what they did'?

867
00:59:31.801 --> 00:59:33.667
Don't start again...

868
00:59:33.903 --> 00:59:35.837
No, but I don't need to justify myself.

869
00:59:36.005 --> 00:59:36.582
Maybe you're a bad Muslim then.

870
00:59:36.606 --> 00:59:38.802
Maybe you're a bad Muslim then.

871
00:59:39.142 --> 00:59:41.167
- Where's your veil'?
- Oh, no...


872
00:59:41.411 --> 00:59:43.846
I don't need your permission!

873
00:59:44.013 --> 00:59:45.503
Your big brother's then?

874
00:59:45.748 --> 00:59:47.842
Antoine, enough. This...

875
00:59:48.584 --> 00:59:50.596
this endless provocation is exhausting.

876
00:59:50.620 --> 00:59:52.054
This endless provocation is exhausting.

877
00:59:52.255 --> 00:59:55.225
You ruin your interesting ideas
with this crap.


878
00:59:55.425 --> 00:59:56.915
What was interesting?

879
00:59:57.126 --> 00:59:59.458
It's interesting to define the limits

880
00:59:59.662 --> 01:00:02.461
between murder, terrorism,
armed struggle.


881
01:00:02.665 --> 01:00:04.827
You make it interesting.

882
01:00:05.034 --> 01:00:05.110
I just don't think
gratuitous murder exists.


883
01:00:05.134 --> 01:00:09.162
I just don't think
gratuitous murder exists.


884
01:00:09.372 --> 01:00:10.669
You said the opposite.

885
01:00:10.873 --> 01:00:12.739
I didn't say the opposite.

886
01:00:12.975 --> 01:00:15.171
I picked the wrong words.

887
01:00:17.447 --> 01:00:19.124
The guys at the Bataclan...

888
01:00:19.148 --> 01:00:20.138
The guys at the Bataclan...

889
01:00:20.850 --> 01:00:23.842
in their minds, they were heroes.
They thought,


890
01:00:24.053 --> 01:00:27.079
"Let's let off steam
by killing infidels."


891
01:00:27.323 --> 01:00:28.984
I'm not saying...

892
01:00:29.358 --> 01:00:31.850
they were right
but it's comprehensible.


893
01:00:32.829 --> 01:00:33.138
I hope you're joking.

894
01:00:33.162 --> 01:00:34.459
I hope you're joking.

895
01:00:35.031 --> 01:00:37.966
What?
Haven't you ever wanted to kill?


896
01:00:38.568 --> 01:00:41.663
You write about sordid murders all day.

897
01:00:41.871 --> 01:00:43.635
You've never wanted to kill?

898
01:00:45.575 --> 01:00:47.653
I imagine what a character thinks.

899
01:00:47.677 --> 01:00:48.473
I imagine what a character thinks.

900
01:00:48.678 --> 01:00:50.612
I've never wanted to kill.

901
01:00:50.813 --> 01:00:54.147
For a love story,
you use your own experience.


902
01:00:54.584 --> 01:00:57.576
You can't confuse love and murder.

903
01:00:57.920 --> 01:01:01.015
- That's why your stuff doesn't work.
- What?


904
01:01:01.224 --> 01:01:03.852
- I read one of your books.
- Really?


905
01:01:04.060 --> 01:01:05.721
I'm flattered.

906
01:01:06.829 --> 01:01:08.661
- Which one?
- Lost Wager.


907
01:01:08.865 --> 01:01:10.663
Not the mildest one.

908
01:01:15.772 --> 01:01:17.536
What are you doing?

909
01:01:17.907 --> 01:01:19.204
Reading it to us?

910
01:01:19.408 --> 01:01:22.002
- Do you mind?
- No, not at all.


911
01:01:25.014 --> 01:01:28.314
"Just as his hand was about to grab
the breeze-block,


912
01:01:28.518 --> 01:01:32.682
Jeremy was overcome
by burning yet sterile remorse.


913
01:01:33.055 --> 01:01:36.025
Indeed, his hand showed no hesitation

914
01:01:36.225 --> 01:01:39.092
as his fingers closed
on the granular mass.


915
01:01:39.295 --> 01:01:41.593
He was like a
witness of his own act,

916
01:01:41.798 --> 01:01:45.063
of the majesty in the arc
his arm formed


917
01:01:45.268 --> 01:01:48.363
before the block
struck his brother's skull.


918
01:01:48.571 --> 01:01:50.869
The impact sparked
a strange sadness:


919
01:01:51.207 --> 01:01:54.734
a sense of the irreparable,
yet oi infinite beauty.


920
01:01:54.944 --> 01:01:57.606
He stood gazing
at the debris at his feet,


921
01:01:57.814 --> 01:02:00.408
carefully avoiding his brother's gaze

922
01:02:00.616 --> 01:02:05.383
and those eyes that died in an instant,
without a sound or a whimper."


923
01:02:09.559 --> 01:02:11.049
What's your point?

924
01:02:11.460 --> 01:02:13.622
It's like you listen to yourself.

925
01:02:14.297 --> 01:02:15.662
They're pretty sentences,

926
01:02:15.898 --> 01:02:18.595
nicely constructed.
You write well but...


927
01:02:18.801 --> 01:02:21.395
you don't seem to feel the thing.

928
01:02:22.805 --> 01:02:25.001
I thought it was pretty good.

929
01:02:25.241 --> 01:02:26.504
Like slow motion.

930
01:02:26.676 --> 01:02:29.304
A guy thinks all that in a flash?

931
01:02:29.512 --> 01:02:32.379
- Why not?
- Maybe not, but it's literature.


932
01:02:32.615 --> 01:02:34.481
Literature's dumb then.

933
01:02:35.251 --> 01:02:36.844
Thanks a lot.

934
01:02:37.286 --> 01:02:40.483
You aim for style with long sentences

935
01:02:40.690 --> 01:02:42.522
and old words like...

936
01:02:42.758 --> 01:02:44.226
I dunno...

937
01:02:44.861 --> 01:02:46.056
"granular“.

938
01:02:46.762 --> 01:02:48.127
With small grains.

939
01:02:48.331 --> 01:02:50.766
- I realized.
- So everything's fine.


940
01:02:50.967 --> 01:02:54.267
The problem is
you use a pretentious word,


941
01:02:54.470 --> 01:02:56.165
not an everyday one.

942
01:02:56.873 --> 01:03:00.070
Literature isn't simply telling a story.

943
01:03:00.309 --> 01:03:04.246
You look for the right word,
one that sounds right.


944
01:03:04.447 --> 01:03:06.415
So you pick a dead word!

945
01:03:06.616 --> 01:03:08.380
I don't set out to.

946
01:03:08.851 --> 01:03:12.549
In this precise case,
I could have used "grainy“,


947
01:03:13.055 --> 01:03:14.523
but it's so dull!

948
01:03:14.724 --> 01:03:17.750
- Do you say "granular" to people?
- No.


949
01:03:17.994 --> 01:03:19.462
So it's a bit out-dated.

950
01:03:19.662 --> 01:03:21.187
You're pissing her off.

951
01:03:21.397 --> 01:03:23.092
What's up'? We're talking.

952
01:03:23.332 --> 01:03:26.700
I say she doesn't know
what a killer thinks.


953
01:03:26.903 --> 01:03:28.928
- And she gets mad.
- I'm not.


954
01:03:29.505 --> 01:03:32.475
Anyone can see you're pissed off-.

955
01:03:33.976 --> 01:03:36.445
I'm not here to be insulted, OK.

956
01:03:36.646 --> 01:03:38.171
Take your things and go.

957
01:03:52.061 --> 01:03:54.086
It's worse than I thought.

958
01:03:54.330 --> 01:03:56.321
Maybe it's just temporary.

959
01:03:56.999 --> 01:03:58.797
I shouldn't have told you.

960
01:03:59.902 --> 01:04:01.336
What's the problem?

961
01:04:02.071 --> 01:04:03.869
- Is it Yann'?
- Yes.


962
01:04:04.073 --> 01:04:05.905
And the other characters.

963
01:04:06.609 --> 01:04:10.477
When I reread it,
I feel I'm exploiting them,


964
01:04:10.713 --> 01:04:13.011
putting my words in their mouths.

965
01:04:13.849 --> 01:04:16.477
Sorry to state the obvious but...

966
01:04:16.686 --> 01:04:19.018
isn't writing always like that?

967
01:04:20.189 --> 01:04:23.318
But it's as if Yann has no autonomy.

968
01:04:23.526 --> 01:04:26.120
He's waiting with his big eyes

969
01:04:26.629 --> 01:04:30.725
for me to dress and feed him.
I feel like his mother.


970
01:04:31.367 --> 01:04:34.302
"Wear a scarf, dear, it's chilly."

971
01:04:34.470 --> 01:04:37.770
I dreamt of a teenager who'd be

972
01:04:38.474 --> 01:04:39.737
lively,

973
01:04:39.942 --> 01:04:42.070
almost brutal sometimes,

974
01:04:42.411 --> 01:04:44.345
sexy as the devil...

975
01:04:45.614 --> 01:04:48.606
The more I work,
the less I like him.

976
01:04:50.286 --> 01:04:52.948
Want me to come down next weekend?

977
01:04:53.622 --> 01:04:54.783
No, please.

978
01:04:55.124 --> 01:04:56.592
Sorry, but I...

979
01:04:57.159 --> 01:04:59.253
I think I need to be alone.

980
01:05:00.930 --> 01:05:02.227
I won't insist.

981
01:05:03.332 --> 01:05:04.800
Thanks for calling.

982
01:05:05.835 --> 01:05:07.166
Lots of love.

983
01:05:07.403 --> 01:05:09.098
Yeah, lots of love.

984
01:06:05.327 --> 01:06:07.091
Sorry to bother you.

985
01:06:07.296 --> 01:06:10.994
I'm Olivia Déjazet.
I run the writing workshop.


986
01:06:11.200 --> 01:06:12.190
All right.

987
01:06:12.635 --> 01:06:14.228
Is Antoine in'?

988
01:06:14.703 --> 01:06:16.228
Yes. ls there a problem'?

989
01:06:16.472 --> 01:06:19.407
No. Do you think
I could talk to him'?

990
01:06:19.575 --> 01:06:22.101
Of course. Come in. Second floor.

991
01:06:22.344 --> 01:06:23.539
Ok. Thank you.

992
01:06:31.353 --> 01:06:32.514
Good evening.

993
01:06:32.721 --> 01:06:33.984
Come in, please.

994
01:06:38.861 --> 01:06:40.727
Hello, Olivia Déjazet.

995
01:06:40.930 --> 01:06:42.056
How do you do?

996
01:06:42.264 --> 01:06:44.232
Would you like a drink'?

997
01:06:44.433 --> 01:06:46.265
No, I won't disturb you.

998
01:06:46.502 --> 01:06:48.834
Tell us if there's a problem.

999
01:06:49.038 --> 01:06:51.632
- Not at all.
- He says nothing.


1000
01:06:51.841 --> 01:06:53.605
So we're a bit...

1001
01:06:53.776 --> 01:06:55.801
Don't worry, it's fine.

1002
01:06:59.415 --> 01:07:01.679
He never hears when he's in his room.

1003
01:07:01.884 --> 01:07:03.079
Come with me.

1004
01:07:13.262 --> 01:07:14.730
Shit, you scared me!

1005
01:07:15.364 --> 01:07:16.854
Don't exaggerate.

1006
01:07:17.066 --> 01:07:19.228
- Ah... Hello.
- Hello, Antoine.


1007
01:07:24.907 --> 01:07:26.068
I'll leave you.

1008
01:07:32.748 --> 01:07:34.341
Sorry to disturb you.

1009
01:07:34.550 --> 01:07:36.985
But I've come here because

1010
01:07:37.386 --> 01:07:40.651
I wanted to make it clear that...

1011
01:07:41.056 --> 01:07:43.423
you can come back tomorrow.

1012
01:07:45.060 --> 01:07:47.085
I planned to anyway.

1013
01:07:47.630 --> 01:07:48.825
Good.

1014
01:07:49.465 --> 01:07:51.399
So no misunderstandings?

1015
01:07:52.301 --> 01:07:53.462
No, it's fine.

1016
01:07:57.940 --> 01:08:00.466
May I come in? Do you mind?

1017
01:08:10.452 --> 01:08:11.476
Here.

1018
01:08:25.467 --> 01:08:26.798
It's nice here.

1019
01:08:29.004 --> 01:08:30.199
It's great!

1020
01:08:32.308 --> 01:08:33.503
Listen...

1021
01:08:34.009 --> 01:08:37.274
We need to talk about
what's happening


1022
01:08:37.479 --> 01:08:38.776
with the others.

1023
01:08:40.382 --> 01:08:41.543
I'm OK.

1024
01:08:43.886 --> 01:08:45.411
I'd just like to say

1025
01:08:45.654 --> 01:08:49.181
you could drop the provocation,
couldn't you?


1026
01:08:51.293 --> 01:08:52.624
I don't provoke.

1027
01:08:52.828 --> 01:08:54.489
You know what I mean.

1028
01:08:57.733 --> 01:09:01.033
The continual clashes become tiring.

1029
01:09:02.338 --> 01:09:07.003
You seem to make insulting remarks
just to annoy everyone.


1030
01:09:07.209 --> 01:09:08.973
Malika, for instance.

1031
01:09:11.513 --> 01:09:13.038
No idea what you mean.

1032
01:09:16.752 --> 01:09:19.050
You don't have to be friends.

1033
01:09:19.989 --> 01:09:22.981
But you should be able to communicate.

1034
01:09:23.192 --> 01:09:25.456
It is group work after all.

1035
01:09:27.029 --> 01:09:29.157
Why are you telling me this?

1036
01:09:30.165 --> 01:09:31.963
I've had loads of ideas.

1037
01:09:32.167 --> 01:09:37.196
That's why I don't understand
why you suddenly say sick things


1038
01:09:37.740 --> 01:09:39.401
you don't even believe.

1039
01:09:40.276 --> 01:09:42.301
You know what I think now?

1040
01:09:43.279 --> 01:09:44.644
No, I don't.

1041
01:09:46.215 --> 01:09:47.979
But they ring false.

1042
01:09:49.251 --> 01:09:51.379
I just say what I think.

1043
01:09:51.787 --> 01:09:55.314
Too bad if it shocks the others.
I don't need them.


1044
01:09:56.592 --> 01:09:58.390
You seem very lonely.

1045
01:09:59.295 --> 01:10:00.421
What do you know?

1046
01:10:01.764 --> 01:10:02.925
Shit---...

1047
01:10:03.432 --> 01:10:05.958
It's a struggle helping you.

1048
01:10:06.201 --> 01:10:07.293
Helping me?

1049
01:10:07.770 --> 01:10:09.898
What is this? I don't need help.

1050
01:10:14.943 --> 01:10:17.878
It got you mad
when I talked about your book.


1051
01:10:19.315 --> 01:10:21.147
I don't really think so.

1052
01:10:21.917 --> 01:10:23.214
Be honest.

1053
01:10:23.886 --> 01:10:26.150
It wasn't pleasant but...

1054
01:10:26.955 --> 01:10:29.652
It felt like you wanted revenge.

1055
01:10:29.892 --> 01:10:31.087
Bullshit.

1056
01:10:32.261 --> 01:10:34.457
That's how it felt anyhow.

1057
01:10:34.930 --> 01:10:39.458
It's silly, but I'm vulnerable
when people mock what I write.


1058
01:10:40.402 --> 01:10:42.666
That's your problem.

1059
01:10:43.405 --> 01:10:46.397
Maybe I shouldn't have reacted
like that.


1060
01:10:53.449 --> 01:10:54.473
I'll be going.

1061
01:10:57.019 --> 01:10:58.316
See you tomorrow.

1062
01:12:13.595 --> 01:12:16.292
Our ideas are making headway.

1063
01:12:16.532 --> 01:12:19.797
We have a lot in common
with interesting people.


1064
01:12:20.002 --> 01:12:21.766
People like Dieudonné,

1065
01:12:21.937 --> 01:12:23.405
Zemmour and others.

1066
01:12:23.605 --> 01:12:25.630
It's very interesting

1067
01:12:26.375 --> 01:12:29.504
and important
how they've freed speech.


1068
01:12:35.451 --> 01:12:37.442
But what can we do?

1069
01:12:37.686 --> 01:12:39.211
Good question.

1070
01:12:39.421 --> 01:12:41.116
I was coming to that.

1071
01:12:41.890 --> 01:12:44.018
Why are our ideas making headway?

1072
01:12:44.560 --> 01:12:49.157
We're not pantomime activists
like in traditional parties.


1073
01:12:51.133 --> 01:12:54.433
We're ready
to get up at 4 am for the party,


1074
01:12:54.636 --> 01:12:57.571
post bills
or sit in a cell all night.


1075
01:12:57.773 --> 01:13:00.367
We're even ready to get beaten up!

1076
01:13:01.410 --> 01:13:05.244
If you join us, we'll
ask a lot of you.

1077
01:13:07.382 --> 01:13:11.649
But it's not a lot compared
to what we'll lose if we do fuck all-.


1078
01:13:21.597 --> 01:13:23.588
- Steph, what's up'?
- El Diablo!


1079
01:13:25.501 --> 01:13:26.593
Hand it over.

1080
01:13:40.782 --> 01:13:43.149
Know who I am?
Know who I am?


1081
01:13:43.352 --> 01:13:45.013
I'm Teddy Chauvin, man.

1082
01:13:46.522 --> 01:13:48.320
Bang-bang, you too!

1083
01:13:52.861 --> 01:13:55.956
- Seen your wimpy mug'?
- She's playin' the dealer.


1084
01:13:56.598 --> 01:13:57.622
Where's my 20'?

1085
01:13:57.833 --> 01:13:59.597
Arabs wear shells now?

1086
01:13:59.801 --> 01:14:02.327
Your sunhat is ruining your hair!

1087
01:14:02.538 --> 01:14:04.506
Fashion disaster...

1088
01:14:04.706 --> 01:14:06.572
You're gorgeous, babe.

1089
01:14:06.808 --> 01:14:09.106
The ape knows how to talk!

1090
01:14:11.547 --> 01:14:14.312
- We thought you'd forgotten.
- Sorry.


1091
01:14:14.516 --> 01:14:16.006
How are you today?

1092
01:14:19.521 --> 01:14:21.046
You overslept, ma'am?

1093
01:14:22.057 --> 01:14:23.821
I got to sleep late.

1094
01:14:24.026 --> 01:14:27.223
- How come'? You went out'?
- Not even.


1095
01:14:29.031 --> 01:14:31.056
- Shall we sit outside?
- Sure.


1096
01:14:58.260 --> 01:14:59.455
Everything Ok?

1097
01:14:59.695 --> 01:15:00.856
Yeah, fine.

1098
01:15:09.938 --> 01:15:12.703
20 or 30 years after being fired,

1099
01:15:12.908 --> 01:15:16.435
they find their old foreman
who's doing well,


1100
01:15:16.678 --> 01:15:18.612
working for a big company.

1101
01:15:18.780 --> 01:15:21.442
They decide to kidnap him

1102
01:15:21.950 --> 01:15:24.920
for a ransom.
They take him to the yard.


1103
01:15:25.120 --> 01:15:28.454
They hold him
on a yacht being refurbished,


1104
01:15:28.690 --> 01:15:31.887
but things don't go as planned.

1105
01:15:32.761 --> 01:15:35.059
The guy's a bit arrogant.

1106
01:15:35.263 --> 01:15:38.198
It's annoying
and one of them hits him.


1107
01:15:38.400 --> 01:15:39.868
He tries to flee.

1108
01:15:40.068 --> 01:15:42.765
In the struggle, he falls overboard,

1109
01:15:42.971 --> 01:15:44.439
strikes the scaffolding

1110
01:15:44.640 --> 01:15:46.335
and hits the ground, dead.

1111
01:15:46.575 --> 01:15:50.205
To cover up,
they hide him on the yacht...


1112
01:15:51.079 --> 01:15:52.171
Not bad.

1113
01:15:53.215 --> 01:15:54.705
What do you think?

1114
01:15:54.916 --> 01:15:56.213
I dunno...

1115
01:15:56.418 --> 01:15:59.251
It's a bit of a let-down,
an accident...


1116
01:15:59.888 --> 01:16:03.153
I'm not dissing your work,
but it could be better.


1117
01:16:05.260 --> 01:16:07.752
Antoine, you're not usually so quiet.

1118
01:16:08.597 --> 01:16:11.225
Let him sleep, it's a nice change.

1119
01:16:14.336 --> 01:16:18.136
I also think it's a pity
it's not a real murder...


1120
01:16:19.007 --> 01:16:20.634
But I don't care.

1121
01:16:20.842 --> 01:16:22.367
That settles it.

1122
01:16:25.113 --> 01:16:27.275
All right. So what do we do?

1123
01:17:23.338 --> 01:17:24.499
How's it going?

1124
01:17:26.174 --> 01:17:27.972
- Taking a walk?
- Yes.


1125
01:17:28.477 --> 01:17:30.809
Actually, I wanted to see you.

1126
01:17:31.513 --> 01:17:33.481
- You followed me'?
- No.


1127
01:17:33.849 --> 01:17:36.284
I knew you'd probably be here.

1128
01:17:42.157 --> 01:17:44.319
You were very quiet today.

1129
01:17:45.393 --> 01:17:46.986
I did as you said.

1130
01:17:47.829 --> 01:17:50.628
I didn't agree with their stuff.

1131
01:17:50.832 --> 01:17:52.596
- I kept quiet.
- Even so...


1132
01:17:53.034 --> 01:17:54.832
You can express yourself.

1133
01:17:55.036 --> 01:17:57.664
You keep changing, you're complicated.

1134
01:17:57.873 --> 01:17:59.466
No, you're weird.

1135
01:17:59.674 --> 01:18:01.005
I'm not weird.

1136
01:18:03.211 --> 01:18:05.873
That's not what I wanted to talk about.

1137
01:18:08.016 --> 01:18:10.508
It's about the book I'm writing.

1138
01:18:14.389 --> 01:18:15.686
You could help me.

1139
01:18:16.725 --> 01:18:18.523
Help you write?

1140
01:18:19.094 --> 01:18:20.391
Let's say...

1141
01:18:20.962 --> 01:18:23.488
I'd like to ask you about your life,

1142
01:18:24.032 --> 01:18:26.023
about your ideas...

1143
01:18:26.768 --> 01:18:28.702
I think it could help me.

1144
01:18:29.437 --> 01:18:31.963
- You want to write about me?
- No.


1145
01:18:33.441 --> 01:18:38.641
The book's advancing nicely,
but you could help feed my characters.


1146
01:18:43.485 --> 01:18:45.476
How long would your thing take?

1147
01:18:46.121 --> 01:18:47.452
Not too long.

1148
01:18:47.823 --> 01:18:50.258
- A couple of hours.
- That long?


1149
01:18:51.226 --> 01:18:53.718
You're not obliged to accept.

1150
01:18:54.963 --> 01:18:56.226
I'll see.

1151
01:18:57.833 --> 01:18:58.994
When'?

1152
01:18:59.234 --> 01:19:01.828
Any time.
An evening, a weekend...


1153
01:19:04.639 --> 01:19:06.129
I'll think about ii.

1154
01:19:12.113 --> 01:19:13.638
There he is, guys.

1155
01:19:14.282 --> 01:19:18.048
Everyone on the crystals.
Take out the little monsters.


1156
01:19:20.689 --> 01:19:23.056
All strike the ice now!

1157
01:19:23.825 --> 01:19:25.623
Go on, uphill!

1158
01:19:26.628 --> 01:19:27.823
Fuck, I'm dying!

1159
01:19:28.196 --> 01:19:30.130
I'm dying, I need a heal.

1160
01:19:30.599 --> 01:19:31.760
I'm dying!

1161
01:19:32.334 --> 01:19:33.529
Fuck!

1162
01:19:43.144 --> 01:19:46.341
"They loved recalling the past fight,

1163
01:19:46.548 --> 01:19:48.073
"the mass demonstrations,

1164
01:19:49.217 --> 01:19:51.914
"the meetings to change the world...

1165
01:19:52.153 --> 01:19:53.746
"They were young then.

1166
01:19:54.489 --> 01:19:59.017
"The three of them would meet up
to drink and to have a good laugh.


1167
01:19:59.227 --> 01:20:03.095
“They'd recall times
when there were 50 or 100 of them


1168
01:20:03.331 --> 01:20:05.163
"in the union offices,

1169
01:20:05.367 --> 01:20:08.200
"packed with people and hope.

1170
01:20:09.237 --> 01:20:12.104
"They'd spend evenings
recalling old stories,


1171
01:20:12.340 --> 01:20:14.468
"days of triumph or failure,

1172
01:20:14.809 --> 01:20:17.642
“names of colleagues
who fought with them.


1173
01:20:18.079 --> 01:20:21.447
"At times, they'd recall a face,
not the name.


1174
01:20:22.150 --> 01:20:24.949
“They'd spend hours
trying to remember it..."


1175
01:21:31.553 --> 01:21:33.248
Come in, it's not locked.

1176
01:21:40.495 --> 01:21:42.020
Sorry I'm late.

1177
01:21:42.263 --> 01:21:44.027
I thought you'd forgotten.

1178
01:21:44.232 --> 01:21:46.826
No, I was just busy.

1179
01:21:47.002 --> 01:21:47.992
Come on.

1180
01:21:52.974 --> 01:21:54.135
Come on in.

1181
01:21:54.676 --> 01:21:55.837
It's this way.

1182
01:22:03.952 --> 01:22:05.147
Want a drink'?

1183
01:22:05.353 --> 01:22:07.378
- What have you got?
- Everything.


1184
01:22:07.756 --> 01:22:10.418
Coke, orange juice, beer...

1185
01:22:10.992 --> 01:22:12.517
Orange juice is good.

1186
01:22:31.780 --> 01:22:33.475
Sit down if you want.

1187
01:22:34.215 --> 01:22:36.650
We'll work at the table.

1188
01:22:43.058 --> 01:22:44.321
Sit down.

1189
01:22:55.837 --> 01:22:57.771
Mind if I record you?

1190
01:22:58.573 --> 01:23:00.200
No. Why would I'?

1191
01:23:00.842 --> 01:23:02.537
Some people don't like it.

1192
01:23:04.746 --> 01:23:07.181
Do you often question people'?

1193
01:23:07.515 --> 01:23:09.449
No, but it happens.

1194
01:23:11.820 --> 01:23:13.515
Want a cake first?

1195
01:23:13.721 --> 01:23:15.553
No, I ate not long ago.

1196
01:23:18.493 --> 01:23:23.158
So, tor starters,
what do you like to do with your days?


1197
01:23:26.601 --> 01:23:29.730
With the workshop,
I don't have time tor much else.


1198
01:23:29.938 --> 01:23:32.532
I meant the days you don't go.

1199
01:23:34.209 --> 01:23:36.644
On days I don't work, 
I like to walk.

1200
01:23:36.845 --> 01:23:38.813
I go down to the cove.

1201
01:23:39.013 --> 01:23:41.107
I stay a couple of hours...

1202
01:23:41.516 --> 01:23:43.985
Then, I go to eat with my parents.

1203
01:23:44.185 --> 01:23:46.347
You get on with your parents'?

1204
01:23:46.855 --> 01:23:48.152
They're cool.

1205
01:23:50.024 --> 01:23:54.188
My dad yells at me sometimes
cos I don't talk much---...


1206
01:23:58.533 --> 01:24:00.160
True, I don't talk much.

1207
01:24:01.069 --> 01:24:03.060
After I finish eating,

1208
01:24:03.738 --> 01:24:05.399
I go to my room

1209
01:24:05.607 --> 01:24:07.041
and watch stuff online.

1210
01:24:07.976 --> 01:24:09.603
What kind of stuff?

1211
01:24:10.478 --> 01:24:11.809
Loads of stuff.

1212
01:24:12.046 --> 01:24:13.377
Like most people.

1213
01:24:16.885 --> 01:24:20.321
You said, “When I don't work."
You work sometimes?


1214
01:24:20.488 --> 01:24:21.751
I didn't know.

1215
01:24:22.657 --> 01:24:25.752
Last year,
I worked a few days a week.


1216
01:24:26.261 --> 01:24:28.195
A kids' club supervisor.

1217
01:24:28.396 --> 01:24:29.693
Did you like it?

1218
01:24:32.467 --> 01:24:34.128
I like kids, so...

1219
01:24:37.438 --> 01:24:38.906
Why not this year'?

1220
01:24:41.442 --> 01:24:42.967
There was trouble.

1221
01:24:47.415 --> 01:24:48.940
You won't say more?

1222
01:24:50.952 --> 01:24:53.387
- It was the parents.
- What?


1223
01:24:53.588 --> 01:24:56.114
They said I spoke badly to their kids.

1224
01:24:58.660 --> 01:25:00.424
Anyhow, I'll join the army.

1225
01:25:01.129 --> 01:25:03.496
Really? You've applied?

1226
01:25:05.133 --> 01:25:06.999
I checked it out online.

1227
01:25:09.103 --> 01:25:11.265
I get the impression

1228
01:25:11.472 --> 01:25:13.463
you're alone a lot.

1229
01:25:14.509 --> 01:25:17.809
I don't need people on my back
all the time.


1230
01:25:18.012 --> 01:25:20.379
- You have friends?
- Of course.


1231
01:25:20.815 --> 01:25:22.579
You don't see them much?

1232
01:25:23.484 --> 01:25:24.679
I do.

1233
01:25:25.153 --> 01:25:28.783
My cousin lives downstairs.
I see him and the guys.


1234
01:25:28.990 --> 01:25:32.756
What do you do together?
Go out, talk...


1235
01:25:32.961 --> 01:25:34.827
We go out, we talk...

1236
01:25:35.163 --> 01:25:36.187
Normal stuff.

1237
01:25:37.632 --> 01:25:39.623
Do politics interest you?

1238
01:25:43.137 --> 01:25:44.127
No.

1239
01:25:45.240 --> 01:25:49.871
We see each other for fun,
fora laugh.


1240
01:25:50.078 --> 01:25:52.775
Not to waste time on crap like that.

1241
01:25:53.014 --> 01:25:56.609
Do the others work?
What does your cousin do?


1242
01:25:56.818 --> 01:25:58.081
He's a mason.

1243
01:25:59.153 --> 01:26:01.087
He's with a temp agency.

1244
01:26:01.256 --> 01:26:02.781
He doesn't make much.

1245
01:26:03.024 --> 01:26:06.654
Even so,
I guess he can do more than you.


1246
01:26:07.362 --> 01:26:10.229
I dunno. I'm at my parents'.

1247
01:26:10.431 --> 01:26:13.423
He has his wife and kid.
Dependents.


1248
01:26:16.170 --> 01:26:19.140
He clearly states his political views...

1249
01:26:23.544 --> 01:26:24.978
What do you mean?

1250
01:26:25.713 --> 01:26:28.910
I'll try to be clearer.
Teddy is your cousin?


1251
01:26:29.851 --> 01:26:30.784
You know him?

1252
01:26:32.887 --> 01:26:34.855
I saw his Internet profile.

1253
01:26:35.290 --> 01:26:37.884
You found it by accident?

1254
01:26:38.226 --> 01:26:41.218
Not by accident.
He's one of your friends.


1255
01:26:41.429 --> 01:26:42.555
You saw mine too?

1256
01:26:44.198 --> 01:26:47.293
He clearly states his opinions anyhow.

1257
01:26:47.468 --> 01:26:49.835
He's even posted a video

1258
01:26:50.071 --> 01:26:53.041
of a meeting he was at
with a guy


1259
01:26:53.241 --> 01:26:56.074
who has extreme right-wing ideas.

1260
01:26:57.812 --> 01:26:59.780
You've been investigating?

1261
01:27:00.214 --> 01:27:01.875
No, I'm not a cop.

1262
01:27:02.083 --> 01:27:05.451
I was surprised
to find that unprotected.


1263
01:27:05.653 --> 01:27:08.452
Is it smart using free access?

1264
01:27:08.656 --> 01:27:13.617
Proves it's not extreme right-wing.
They're just opposed to the system.


1265
01:27:14.996 --> 01:27:17.931
That's how the far right defines itself.

1266
01:27:18.132 --> 01:27:20.157
For you lot, they're Nazis.

1267
01:27:20.401 --> 01:27:21.732
"You lot"?

1268
01:27:22.136 --> 01:27:24.104
You know what I mean.

1269
01:27:24.305 --> 01:27:26.433
I don't, but never mind.

1270
01:27:28.276 --> 01:27:32.213
I saw a video of you
on a beach at night.


1271
01:27:32.413 --> 01:27:35.678
You, Teddy your cousin, friends...

1272
01:27:38.353 --> 01:27:39.320
You did?

1273
01:27:41.155 --> 01:27:42.680
You were having fun.

1274
01:27:43.624 --> 01:27:47.117
You'd camouflaged your face with din.
Remember'?


1275
01:27:49.330 --> 01:27:50.627
It was at dawn.

1276
01:27:50.832 --> 01:27:52.027
Maybe.

1277
01:27:52.467 --> 01:27:54.128
I saw you strip too.

1278
01:27:54.335 --> 01:27:55.530
Jeez...

1279
01:27:57.105 --> 01:27:59.369
And I saw you had a gun.

1280
01:28:03.811 --> 01:28:05.643
What do you do with it?

1281
01:28:07.548 --> 01:28:09.744
Use it to scare yourself?

1282
01:28:10.952 --> 01:28:12.215
We have fun.

1283
01:28:13.721 --> 01:28:16.053
Odd way to have fun, isn't it?

1284
01:28:16.491 --> 01:28:18.084
We don't hurt anyone.

1285
01:28:18.559 --> 01:28:20.357
I don't know about that.

1286
01:28:21.329 --> 01:28:23.354
Then again, I'm not a cop.

1287
01:28:25.400 --> 01:28:27.391
What I'd like to understand

1288
01:28:28.002 --> 01:28:30.266
is what you're thinking then.

1289
01:28:30.471 --> 01:28:33.338
Why do you show yourselves like that?

1290
01:28:33.541 --> 01:28:35.737
What do you tell yourselves

1291
01:28:36.244 --> 01:28:38.212
when you make those videos?

1292
01:28:43.251 --> 01:28:44.776
I'll have one after all.

1293
01:28:46.421 --> 01:28:47.752
Help yourself.

1294
01:29:01.669 --> 01:29:05.367
I don't get what you're after.
What can I tell you?


1295
01:29:06.941 --> 01:29:08.534
I don't know yet.

1296
01:29:08.876 --> 01:29:10.241
But I'm listening.

1297
01:29:11.712 --> 01:29:13.544
I have nothing smart to say.

1298
01:29:13.748 --> 01:29:15.238
So you say»-

1299
01:29:19.287 --> 01:29:21.381
For me, you think non-stop.

1300
01:29:22.523 --> 01:29:26.460
You're a lot smarter
than you want us to think.


1301
01:29:27.795 --> 01:29:29.661
I may not be very smart.

1302
01:29:30.398 --> 01:29:31.991
Maybe I'm totally dumb.

1303
01:29:43.878 --> 01:29:46.176
I think I know why I interest you.

1304
01:29:47.114 --> 01:29:49.310
Really? So tell me.

1305
01:29:51.752 --> 01:29:54.084
It's because I scare you.

1306
01:29:56.457 --> 01:29:57.481
Really?

1307
01:29:57.892 --> 01:29:59.155
I dunno...

1308
01:30:00.061 --> 01:30:01.187
It turns you on?

1309
01:30:01.395 --> 01:30:03.557
No, I'm just trying to understand.

1310
01:30:06.501 --> 01:30:08.629
That's what you tell yourself.

1311
01:30:08.836 --> 01:30:10.804
But I see how you look at me.

1312
01:30:17.245 --> 01:30:19.680
- I don't like ii.
- What?


1313
01:30:19.847 --> 01:30:21.008
All this.

1314
01:30:21.749 --> 01:30:23.683
Your questions and stuff.

1315
01:30:24.185 --> 01:30:25.812
It's kind of sick.

1316
01:30:27.455 --> 01:30:29.651
You act like a vampire.

1317
01:30:30.124 --> 01:30:33.651
You suck people's blood
and use it to make money.


1318
01:30:33.861 --> 01:30:36.489
You confuse everything.
It's tiring.


1319
01:30:37.098 --> 01:30:37.894
Let's stop.

1320
01:30:39.934 --> 01:30:41.424
You bet we'll stop.

1321
01:30:52.680 --> 01:30:55.206
It isn't always easy.

1322
01:30:55.449 --> 01:30:59.386
In a group,
you always have conflicting ideas.


1323
01:30:59.554 --> 01:31:02.023
I get pissed off sometimes,

1324
01:31:02.223 --> 01:31:04.021
but in the long run,

1325
01:31:04.225 --> 01:31:07.991
I've met people I'd never have met
in real life.


1326
01:31:09.130 --> 01:31:12.100
We work hard. It's no holiday.

1327
01:31:12.300 --> 01:31:14.894
We'll try to make something good.

1328
01:31:16.637 --> 01:31:20.164
I knew we wouldn't write a best-seller.

1329
01:31:20.841 --> 01:31:24.106
But it's better than mixing cement

1330
01:31:24.312 --> 01:31:25.677
or laying cables.

1331
01:31:26.047 --> 01:31:28.573
It's fun, we're having a laugh.

1332
01:31:30.351 --> 01:31:31.546
It's cool.

1333
01:31:33.487 --> 01:31:36.184
Writing a novel, quite frankly...

1334
01:31:37.158 --> 01:31:39.126
I never thought I would.

1335
01:31:40.261 --> 01:31:43.458
It's a totally awesome experience.

1336
01:31:44.265 --> 01:31:45.892
On my CV,

1337
01:31:46.100 --> 01:31:48.626
it'll look really good.

1338
01:31:50.504 --> 01:31:54.668
Before this, I wrote a lot,
so it's an opportunity


1339
01:31:54.875 --> 01:31:57.242
in relation to my future career

1340
01:31:57.445 --> 01:32:00.278
as a writer or just a journalist.

1341
01:32:00.514 --> 01:32:02.539
In any case, we talk a lot.

1342
01:32:03.217 --> 01:32:06.812
I've discovered ways of thinking
I never suspected.


1343
01:32:07.021 --> 01:32:08.955
Who are these youngsters?

1344
01:32:09.123 --> 01:32:11.820
It's a social integration course, right'?

1345
01:32:12.627 --> 01:32:14.618
They're like other youngsters

1346
01:32:14.862 --> 01:32:17.797
who didn't get much out of school

1347
01:32:17.965 --> 01:32:19.899
or culture either.

1348
01:32:20.101 --> 01:32:21.091
<i>I'm sorry. hope</i>

1349
01:32:21.302 --> 01:32:25.671
they'll discover a relationship
with tree and personal writing


1350
01:32:25.906 --> 01:32:27.340
to reconcile them with literature

1351
01:32:28.275 --> 01:32:29.572
and the world.

1352
01:32:29.777 --> 01:32:31.302
Ambitious, isn't it?

1353
01:32:31.545 --> 01:32:33.377
We need to remember

1354
01:32:33.581 --> 01:32:36.278
that the goal is to write a thriller.

1355
01:32:37.051 --> 01:32:40.715
hurt destined to be published.

1356
01:32:40.921 --> 01:32:42.047
Yes, absolutely.

1357
01:32:42.256 --> 01:32:44.281
It will be,
and that's important.


1358
01:32:44.492 --> 01:32:47.325
There's nothing more stimulating

1359
01:32:47.561 --> 01:32:49.655
than creating a work,

1360
01:32:50.131 --> 01:32:52.156
whatever its literary value.

1361
01:32:52.400 --> 01:32:55.893
We're not writing for nothing
or for fun.


1362
01:32:56.103 --> 01:32:57.400
There's a result.

1363
01:32:57.605 --> 01:32:59.369
The most interesting thing

1364
01:32:59.573 --> 01:33:02.873
is to see them change over time.

1365
01:33:03.077 --> 01:33:05.671
The way they view themselves alters.

1366
01:33:06.580 --> 01:33:09.379
Writing is a good way to shake yourself,

1367
01:33:09.583 --> 01:33:12.883
escape idleness
and gain in confidence.


1368
01:33:13.487 --> 01:33:14.852
The novel is a pretext,

1369
01:33:15.456 --> 01:33:17.083
the means to do that.

1370
01:34:48.616 --> 01:34:50.141
What are you doing here?

1371
01:35:24.084 --> 01:35:25.779
What's that gun'?

1372
01:35:26.887 --> 01:35:28.355
Are you crazy?

1373
01:35:29.456 --> 01:35:30.582
I'm OK.

1374
01:35:52.446 --> 01:35:53.914
I don't understand.

1375
01:35:55.950 --> 01:35:57.941
What do you want me to say?

1376
01:35:58.853 --> 01:36:00.787
What do you want me to do'?

1377
01:36:01.655 --> 01:36:03.145
What can I do'?

1378
01:36:05.993 --> 01:36:07.290
Can I help you?

1379
01:36:08.829 --> 01:36:10.263
I don't need help.

1380
01:36:19.807 --> 01:36:21.901
So put the gun down, please.

1381
01:36:23.043 --> 01:36:23.908
No.

1382
01:36:26.814 --> 01:36:28.908
Stop pointing it at me at least.

1383
01:36:46.033 --> 01:36:48.161
I'm getting really scared.

1384
01:37:03.150 --> 01:37:04.640
We'll go fora ride.

1385
01:37:06.353 --> 01:37:09.015
In your car.
I'll tell you where to go.


1386
01:37:48.595 --> 01:37:50.222
Let's talk, Antoine.

1387
01:37:52.032 --> 01:37:53.727
Explain everything.

1388
01:37:56.637 --> 01:37:58.071
Do you trust me?

1389
01:38:00.274 --> 01:38:02.641
You know you can trust me-.

1390
01:38:03.944 --> 01:38:05.139
Right, Antoine?

1391
01:38:08.415 --> 01:38:09.940
I won't tell anyone.

1392
01:38:20.060 --> 01:38:22.085
Maybe we misunderstood each other.

1393
01:38:23.897 --> 01:38:25.763
Maybe you can explain.

1394
01:38:33.173 --> 01:38:35.267
Take that track on the left.

1395
01:38:53.360 --> 01:38:54.850
Where are we going?

1396
01:39:05.105 --> 01:39:06.470
Stop here.

1397
01:39:07.674 --> 01:39:09.164
We'll walk from here.

1398
01:39:18.519 --> 01:39:19.884
What do you want?

1399
01:39:20.888 --> 01:39:22.413
I don't wanna talk.

1400
01:41:04.258 --> 01:41:05.419
It's weird.

1401
01:41:06.160 --> 01:41:07.924
I'd never been at night.

1402
01:41:25.679 --> 01:41:26.840
Are you cold?

1403
01:41:28.248 --> 01:41:29.215
No.

1404
01:42:35.549 --> 01:42:36.983
Go if you want.

1405
01:45:18.345 --> 01:45:20.279
- Olivia?
- Yes?


1406
01:45:20.480 --> 01:45:23.472
Do you have a synonym for "bury“?

1407
01:45:24.518 --> 01:45:25.679
Inter.

1408
01:45:26.153 --> 01:45:28.019
Lay to rest, entomb...

1409
01:45:28.221 --> 01:45:30.690
Inter is good.

1410
01:45:50.043 --> 01:45:51.374
Look who's back!

1411
01:45:53.246 --> 01:45:54.236
Hello.

1412
01:45:59.953 --> 01:46:02.115
I want to read something I wrote.

1413
01:46:03.190 --> 01:46:05.488
It's to say goodbye for good.

1414
01:46:05.926 --> 01:46:07.860
Why did you piss us off?

1415
01:46:08.695 --> 01:46:10.220
We don't give a shit.

1416
01:46:10.430 --> 01:46:13.365
- Looking for applause'?
- He drifts in and out.


1417
01:46:14.468 --> 01:46:17.062
I thought about sending it,

1418
01:46:18.104 --> 01:46:20.300
but I preferred to read it here.

1419
01:46:20.907 --> 01:46:22.432
I don't know now.

1420
01:46:24.811 --> 01:46:26.176
It's not too long?

1421
01:46:29.149 --> 01:46:30.810
Go on, we're listening.

1422
01:46:40.093 --> 01:46:41.117
"Yes...

1423
01:46:41.561 --> 01:46:44.929
A man can kill out of boredom,
just to see.


1424
01:46:45.265 --> 01:46:48.565
He could have shot someone
out of boredom,


1425
01:46:48.768 --> 01:46:51.066
just for something to happen.

1426
01:46:51.304 --> 01:46:52.794
He'd have told the cops

1427
01:46:53.006 --> 01:46:56.840
he shot the guy
for being an Arab or a Jew or gay.


1428
01:46:57.477 --> 01:46:59.172
They'd have understood.

1429
01:46:59.412 --> 01:47:01.039
No explaining to do.

1430
01:47:01.781 --> 01:47:04.716
But the victim didn't matter.

1431
01:47:05.185 --> 01:47:07.620
He could even have shot himself.

1432
01:47:07.821 --> 01:47:09.653
They'd have understood too.

1433
01:47:09.856 --> 01:47:12.951
They'd have said
he had no future, no friends...


1434
01:47:13.159 --> 01:47:14.957
But he did neither one.

1435
01:47:15.161 --> 01:47:16.754
He was too weak.

1436
01:47:17.197 --> 01:47:18.687
He had done nothing.

1437
01:47:21.134 --> 01:47:23.125
So he got bored and waited.

1438
01:47:23.537 --> 01:47:24.902
But for what?

1439
01:47:25.438 --> 01:47:26.701
He drifted along.

1440
01:47:27.474 --> 01:47:29.670
Just to pass the time.

1441
01:47:30.210 --> 01:47:31.871
To kill time, as they say.

1442
01:47:32.112 --> 01:47:34.444
But the town was killing him.

1443
01:47:34.881 --> 01:47:36.713
Always the same routes.

1444
01:47:37.284 --> 01:47:41.482
Sometimes, to dispel his boredom,
he'd take a long detour.


1445
01:47:42.022 --> 01:47:43.512
But it didn't work.

1446
01:47:43.823 --> 01:47:46.622
He knew all the roads and tracks.

1447
01:47:46.893 --> 01:47:50.352
He had travelled them so often,
alone, always alone.


1448
01:47:50.897 --> 01:47:52.524
Always the same landscape.

1449
01:47:52.732 --> 01:47:54.826
The yard that no one could avoid.

1450
01:47:55.035 --> 01:47:59.131
The crane that was religiously preserved
like a work of art-.


1451
01:48:00.340 --> 01:48:02.365
He didn't share that nostalgia.

1452
01:48:02.576 --> 01:48:04.408
He didn't care about the yard,

1453
01:48:04.644 --> 01:48:07.841
the workers or the tankers built there.

1454
01:48:08.815 --> 01:48:10.476
That wasn't his story.

1455
01:48:11.184 --> 01:48:14.518
He'd meet people he knew
and pretend to be happy.


1456
01:48:14.721 --> 01:48:18.248
He knew everyone,
so tried to avoid them.


1457
01:48:19.259 --> 01:48:21.956
He felt
these people smiling at him,


1458
01:48:22.195 --> 01:48:26.154
who claimed to love or help him,
talked to him like an animal.


1459
01:48:26.700 --> 01:48:28.532
An animal to be trained.

1460
01:48:29.169 --> 01:48:32.161
He had to realize,
that even if he was bored,


1461
01:48:32.372 --> 01:48:34.238
even if his friends were strangers,

1462
01:48:34.441 --> 01:48:37.376
even with no future, no friends, no job,
