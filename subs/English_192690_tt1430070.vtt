3
00:01:07.714 --> 00:01:09.026
HELLO, THERE.

4
00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.684
RUSTY CARTER.
PLEASED TO MEET YOU.


5
00:01:11.718 --> 00:01:13.306
I OFFICIALLY REGRET
HAVING EYES.


6
00:01:13.341 --> 00:01:14.342
WHO WANTS A DRINK?

7
00:01:14.376 --> 00:01:15.653
NO THANKS.

8
00:01:15.688 --> 00:01:17.517
FINE, FINE.
MORE FOR ME.


9
00:01:19.174 --> 00:01:20.555
HAVE A SEAT,
YOUNG LADIES.


10
00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:54.209
HELLO?

11
00:01:54.244 --> 00:01:57.005
HEY, IS THIS, UM,
LEAH COLLINS?


12
00:01:57.039 --> 00:01:59.007
YES, IT IS,
MAY I ASK WHO'S CALLING?


13
00:01:59.041 --> 00:02:05.462
LOOK, I DON'T KNOW THE RIGHT
WAY TO DO THIS OR WHATEVER.


14
00:02:05.496 --> 00:02:07.291
YOUR DAD DIED.

15
00:02:07.326 --> 00:02:09.155
HE'S...DEAD.

16
00:02:09.189 --> 00:02:10.605
WHAT?

17
00:02:11.985 --> 00:02:13.642
OK. WHO IS THIS?

18
00:02:13.677 --> 00:02:15.644
IT'S CHARLIE TILLERMAN.

19
00:02:15.679 --> 00:02:17.957
YOU KNOW,
HIS OTHER DAUGHTER.


20
00:02:17.991 --> 00:02:19.752
I'M SORRY.

21
00:02:19.786 --> 00:02:22.272
DID YOU JUST SAY
CHARLIE TILLERMAN?


22
00:02:22.306 --> 00:02:23.687
YEAH.

23
00:02:23.721 --> 00:02:25.689
OK. IS THIS SOME
SORT OF JOKE?


24
00:02:25.723 --> 00:02:27.207
YOU DON'T EVEN
KNOW MY DAD.


25
00:02:27.242 --> 00:02:28.036
OH, WOW.

26
00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:29.762
THANKS FOR
REMINDING ME.


27
00:02:29.796 --> 00:02:32.282
ANYWAY, HE DIED IN A BOATING
ACCIDENT OR SOMETHING


28
00:02:32.316 --> 00:02:33.697
AND THIS LAWYER
GUY CALLED.


29
00:02:33.731 --> 00:02:35.285
HE SAID WE HAVE TO
GO DOWN TO ARIZONA


30
00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:38.184
TO FILL OUT SOME PAPERWORK
AND PACK UP HIS SHIT.


31
00:02:38.218 --> 00:02:39.358
OH, AND WE
GOTTA TO DRIVE


32
00:02:39.392 --> 00:02:40.980
BECAUSE THERE'S JUST
A WHOLE BUNCH OF STUFF


33
00:02:41.014 --> 00:02:43.016
AND WE CAN'T FIT IT
ALL ON A PLANE.


34
00:02:47.504 --> 00:02:49.782
YOU'RE SERIOUS?

35
00:02:49.816 --> 00:02:52.819
SO, THIS IS REAL?

36
00:02:54.234 --> 00:02:55.822
YEAH.

37
00:02:55.857 --> 00:02:57.686
WE GOTTA GO PACK UP
HIS STUFF.


38
00:03:04.141 --> 00:03:05.832
OH MY GOD.

39
00:03:05.867 --> 00:03:10.112
HELLO?
ARE YOU STILL THERE?


40
00:03:10.147 --> 00:03:12.322
YEAH, I'M STILL HERE.
I'M JUST...


41
00:03:12.356 --> 00:03:13.702
I'M TRYING TO
FIGURE THIS OUT.


42
00:03:13.737 --> 00:03:14.841
I'M LOOKING AT
MY CALENDAR


43
00:03:14.876 --> 00:03:16.878
AND IT SAYS THAT MY DAD
WAS ON A BUSINESS TRIP.


44
00:03:16.912 --> 00:03:18.983
I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY WOULD
HE HAVE SO MUCH STUFF


45
00:03:19.018 --> 00:03:20.571
THAT WE HAVE
TO BRING BACK.


46
00:03:20.606 --> 00:03:21.607
I HAVE NO
IDEA EITHER.


47
00:03:21.641 --> 00:03:23.263
THE LAWYER JUST
SAID GO TO ARIZONA,


48
00:03:23.298 --> 00:03:24.679
PACK UP HIS SHIT,
AND BRING IT BACK.


49
00:03:24.713 --> 00:03:26.715
I MEAN, THAT'S ALL.
THAT'S ALL I KNOW.


50
00:03:27.854 --> 00:03:30.340
THIS JUST DOESN'T
MAKE ANY SENSE.


51
00:03:30.374 --> 00:03:33.135
I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHY YOU'RE CALLING ME.


52
00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:35.655
YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW HIM--WHY
WOULD YOU BE NOTIFIED FIRST?


53
00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:39.383
WELL, I THINK IT'S PROBABLY
BECAUSE I USE HIS LAST NAME.


54
00:03:39.418 --> 00:03:41.143
AND I WOULDN'T, IF MY
MOM'S MAIDEN NAME


55
00:03:41.178 --> 00:03:43.525
WAS ANYTHING OTHER
THAN RAPER.


56
00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:46.183
YEAH, I GUESS.

57
00:03:46.217 --> 00:03:49.773
OH MY GOD,
MY MOM.


58
00:03:49.807 --> 00:03:51.430
DID YOU CALL
MY MOM?


59
00:03:51.464 --> 00:03:53.293
DOES MY MOM KNOW
ABOUT THIS?


60
00:03:53.328 --> 00:03:54.709
NO, I DIDN'T
TELL HER.


61
00:03:59.403 --> 00:04:00.818
SO, YOU'RE WELCOME TO COME
WITH IF YOU WANT,


62
00:04:00.853 --> 00:04:03.200
BUT YOU GOTTA
COVER HALF THE GAS.


63
00:04:03.234 --> 00:04:05.961
YEAH, WHATEVER.

64
00:04:05.996 --> 00:04:09.137
SORRY I HAD
TO TELL YOU LIKE THIS.


65
00:04:09.171 --> 00:04:11.657
NO YOU'RE NOT.

66
00:04:11.691 --> 00:04:12.830
FAIR ENOUGH.

67
00:04:12.865 --> 00:04:14.694
I'LL TEXT YOU
MY ADDRESS.


68
00:04:14.729 --> 00:04:15.971
SEE YOU TOMORROW.

69
00:06:29.139 --> 00:06:30.934
I CAN'T UNLOCK
MY WINDOW.


70
00:06:30.968 --> 00:06:33.108
YOU CAN'T SMOKE
IN HERE.


71
00:06:33.143 --> 00:06:34.489
YOU'VE GOTTA
BE KIDDING.


72
00:06:34.524 --> 00:06:36.560
WE'RE GONNA DRIVE ALL THE WAY
TO ARIZONA AND I CAN'T SMOKE?


73
00:06:36.595 --> 00:06:39.805
YOU CAN,
JUST NOT IN THE CAR.


74
00:06:39.839 --> 00:06:41.427
IT'S A ROAD TRIP.

75
00:06:41.461 --> 00:06:42.497
EXACTLY.

76
00:06:42.532 --> 00:06:44.016
WHICH MEANS WE'LL BE
STOPPING AT GAS STATIONS.


77
00:06:44.050 --> 00:06:45.500
YOU CAN SMOKE
WHEN WE GET THERE.


78
00:06:47.502 --> 00:06:49.504
GREAT.

79
00:06:52.334 --> 00:06:53.957
PLEASE DON'T
TOUCH THAT.


80
00:07:02.552 --> 00:07:04.726
SHIT!
PULL OVER.


81
00:07:04.761 --> 00:07:05.831
WHAT?

82
00:07:05.865 --> 00:07:07.315
I FORGOT SOMETHING
AT THE HOUSE.


83
00:07:07.349 --> 00:07:10.007
PLEASE, JUST GO
BACK AROUND.


84
00:07:10.042 --> 00:07:11.491
FLIP A BITCH.

85
00:07:11.526 --> 00:07:13.459
I'LL BE REALLY FAST,
I SWEAR.


86
00:07:13.493 --> 00:07:14.356
IS IT IMPORTANT?

87
00:07:14.391 --> 00:07:15.461
YEAH. IT'S REALLY
IMPORTANT.


88
00:07:15.495 --> 00:07:18.153
PLEASE, I
GOTTA HAVE IT.


89
00:07:18.188 --> 00:07:19.672
GOD...

90
00:07:19.707 --> 00:07:20.708
"FLIP A BITCH?"

91
00:07:25.057 --> 00:07:27.093
SO YOU'RE SURE MY CAR'S
GOING TO BE SAFE HERE, RIGHT?


92
00:07:27.128 --> 00:07:29.544
CHILL. IT'S JUST
FOR 3 DAYS.


93
00:07:30.407 --> 00:07:33.341
THIS IS RIDICULOUS.

94
00:07:33.375 --> 00:07:37.138
UGH. IS THIS CAR EVEN GOING
TO MAKE IT TO ARIZONA?


95
00:07:37.172 --> 00:07:39.485
WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME
YOU GOT YOUR OIL CHANGED?


96
00:07:39.519 --> 00:07:41.521
HAVE YOU HAD
YOUR TIRES ROTATED?


97
00:07:41.556 --> 00:07:44.007
DOES YOUR WARRANTY HAVE
ROAD-SIDE ASSISTANCE?


98
00:07:44.041 --> 00:07:44.973
DO YOU HAVE
JUMPER CABLES?


99
00:07:45.008 --> 00:07:46.837
DO YOU EVER
SHUT UP?


100
00:07:48.805 --> 00:07:50.530
SO...WHAT DO YOU
DO FOR A LIVING?


101
00:07:50.565 --> 00:07:51.393
I'M AN ARTIST.

102
00:07:52.532 --> 00:07:55.432
SO, YOU'RE A
WAITRESS THEN?


103
00:07:55.466 --> 00:07:58.435
NO.
NOT FULL TIME.


104
00:07:58.469 --> 00:07:59.539
WHATEVER.

105
00:07:59.574 --> 00:08:00.506
WHAT DO
YOU DO?


106
00:08:00.540 --> 00:08:02.197
OH, I WORK
IN FINANCE.


107
00:08:02.232 --> 00:08:03.820
SO, YOU'RE
A BANK TELLER?


108
00:08:03.854 --> 00:08:06.754
NOT EXACTLY. I'M A
FINANCIAL SYSTEMS ANALYST.


109
00:08:06.788 --> 00:08:07.617
THRILLING.

110
00:08:07.996 --> 00:08:09.998
UGH.
THAT SMELLS FOUL.


111
00:08:46.138 --> 00:08:47.139
HOLY SHIT.

112
00:08:48.416 --> 00:08:50.832
UH, ARE
WE THERE?


113
00:08:50.867 --> 00:08:52.696
I HOPE NOT.

114
00:09:01.394 --> 00:09:02.499
WELCOME TO BEAR LAKE.

115
00:09:02.533 --> 00:09:04.915
MY NAME IS CORY,
HOW CAN I HELP YOU?


116
00:09:04.950 --> 00:09:06.779
UH, YEA, HI, I'M SORRY
TO BOTHER YOU.


117
00:09:06.814 --> 00:09:08.298
I THINK WE MAY HAVE
THE WRONG ADDRESS...


118
00:09:08.332 --> 00:09:10.783
IS THIS

119
00:09:10.818 --> 00:09:12.198
YES IT IS!

120
00:09:12.233 --> 00:09:15.098
OOH! OOH! ARE YOU

00:09:15.132 --> 00:09:16.375
MEMBERS OF
WHAT?


122
00:09:16.409 --> 00:09:18.377
NO, WE'RE ACTUALLY HERE
ABOUT NED TILLERMAN.


123
00:09:18.411 --> 00:09:20.310
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU KNOW HIM,
THIS IS HIS DAUGHTER.


124
00:09:20.344 --> 00:09:22.864
OH MY GOD!
YOU POOR THING.


125
00:09:22.899 --> 00:09:25.142
I'M SO SORRY
ABOUT YOUR DAD.


126
00:09:25.177 --> 00:09:26.696
THANK YOU.

127
00:09:26.730 --> 00:09:29.526
WE'RE HERE

128
00:09:29.560 --> 00:09:30.838
CAN YOU JUST
BUZZ US IN?


129
00:09:30.872 --> 00:09:33.530
OH, YEAH.
WHOOPSIES!


130
00:09:33.564 --> 00:09:36.153
DID HE JUST
SAY "WHOOPSIES?"


131
00:09:36.188 --> 00:09:37.948
OH COME ON, YOU
HEARD THAT LISP.


132
00:09:37.983 --> 00:09:39.674
IT DOESN'T MATTER,
IT'S NOT EVEN AWORD.


133
00:09:39.709 --> 00:09:40.813
YES IT IS.

134
00:09:40.848 --> 00:09:43.195
MY BOYFRIEND IN COLLEGE
USED TO SAY IT ALL THE TIME.


135
00:09:43.229 --> 00:09:45.438
WAS HE STRAIGHT?

136
00:09:45.473 --> 00:09:46.301
STRAIGHT ENOUGH.

137
00:09:47.509 --> 00:09:49.511
BUZZER'S BROKE,
SO HOLD TIGHT.


138
00:09:49.546 --> 00:09:50.961
I'LL OPEN THE GATE

00:09:55.069 --> 00:09:56.208
NATURIST?

140
00:09:56.242 --> 00:09:58.762
WHAT DOES
THAT MEAN?


141
00:09:58.797 --> 00:10:00.695
DID YOU EVER
READ "WALDEN"?


142
00:10:00.730 --> 00:10:02.490
NOPE.

143
00:10:02.524 --> 00:10:04.872
YOU'RE A HIPPIE ARTIST AND
YOU'VE NEVER READ "WALDEN"?


144
00:10:04.906 --> 00:10:06.149
NO, I HAVEN'T.

145
00:10:06.183 --> 00:10:07.702
DID YOU MANAGE TO BECOME
A YUPPIE BITCH


146
00:10:07.737 --> 00:10:09.980
WITHOUT READING
"WHO MOVED MY CHEESE?"


147
00:10:10.015 --> 00:10:11.361
GOD, I LOVE
THAT BOOK!


148
00:10:11.395 --> 00:10:12.983
HEY GIRLFRIENDS!

149

00:10:31.070 --> 00:10:32.002
JESUS.

161
00:10:32.037 --> 00:10:35.868
HI, I'M CORY,
IT'S SO GOOD TO MEET YOU.


162
00:10:35.903 --> 00:10:38.181
CHARLIE.

163
00:10:38.215 --> 00:10:40.873
HEY YOU.
HI! I'M CORY.


164
00:10:40.908 --> 00:10:42.392
LEAH COLLINS.

165
00:10:42.426 --> 00:10:44.704
SO...
WELCOME TO BEAR LAKE!


166
00:10:44.739 --> 00:10:45.567
WE'RE JUST HERE
TO SEE RUSTY--


167
00:10:45.602 --> 00:10:46.672
RUSTY CARTER?

168
00:10:46.706 --> 00:10:48.122
YEAH, HE SAID
HE'D BE HERE.


169
00:10:48.156 --> 00:10:49.468
HE CERTAINLY IS,

170
00:10:49.502 --> 00:10:52.367
BUT I THINK I'D BETTER
TAKE YOU TO SEE KRISTI FIRST.


171
00:10:52.402 --> 00:10:53.472
SHE WOULD BE...?

172
00:10:53.506 --> 00:10:54.542
KRISTI LERNNER.

173
00:10:54.576 --> 00:10:56.268
SHE'S THE RESORT'S
GENERAL MANAGER.


174
00:10:56.302 --> 00:10:58.201
SHE'S JUST INSIDE,
SO LET ME GRAB HER.


175
00:10:58.235 --> 00:11:00.065
THANKS.

176
00:11:06.726 --> 00:11:08.936
GIRLS, IT IS A PLEASURE
TO MEET YOU.


177
00:11:08.970 --> 00:11:10.247
I'M KRISTI.

178
00:11:10.282 --> 00:11:13.975
I'M JUST SO SORRY THAT IT HAD
TO BE UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES.


179
00:11:14.010 --> 00:11:16.426
COME HERE,
BOTH OF YOU.


180
00:11:17.703 --> 00:11:21.224
NED WAS JUST
A WONDERFUL MAN.


181
00:11:21.258 --> 00:11:22.259
A TRUE HERO.

182
00:11:23.882 --> 00:11:27.782
HIS PASSING HAS BEEN
REALLY HARD ON ALL OF US HERE.


183
00:11:27.817 --> 00:11:28.990
HEY PARTY PEOPLE!

184
00:11:29.025 --> 00:11:30.992
MID-DAY DAIQUIRIS ARE
AVAILABLE POOL-SIDE!


185
00:11:31.027 --> 00:11:32.097
COME AND GET 'EM!

186
00:11:32.131 --> 00:11:34.444
YEAH, SOUNDS LIKE YOU'RE
ALL REAL TORN UP ABOUT IT.


187
00:11:34.478 --> 00:11:36.653
WELL, LIFE
GOES ON!


188
00:11:36.687 --> 00:11:38.448
SO, WE APPARENTLY NEED
TO MEET WITH RUSTY.


189
00:11:38.482 --> 00:11:39.518
I TAKE IT HE'S
A LAWYER?


190
00:11:39.552 --> 00:11:41.865
YES. AFTER HE SPENT
SO MUCH TIME HERE,


191
00:11:41.900 --> 00:11:43.487
WE MADE HIM OUR
RESIDENT LEGAL COUNSEL.


192
00:11:43.522 --> 00:11:45.558
AND HE HAS
NED'S WILL?


193
00:11:45.593 --> 00:11:47.560
CORRECT. HE'S BEEN
EXPECTING YOU.


194
00:11:47.595 --> 00:11:48.872
GREAT. CAN YOU
SHOW US TO HIM?


195
00:11:48.907 --> 00:11:49.735
YES.

196
00:11:52.427 --> 00:11:54.395
SO...
WE'LL FOLLOW YOU?


197
00:11:54.429 --> 00:11:57.053
ABSOLUTELY.
RIGHT AFTER YOU DISROBE.


198
00:11:59.538 --> 00:12:01.022
AH, NO THAT'S
NOT HAPPENING.


199
00:12:01.057 --> 00:12:02.058
RIIIGHT.

200
00:12:02.092 --> 00:12:04.336
MY MOM ALWAYS TOLD ME
TO GET THE MONEY FIRST.


201
00:12:06.027 --> 00:12:07.270
IT'S A JOKE.

202
00:12:07.304 --> 00:12:10.376
OH. OK.
WELL, I'M NOT JOKING.


203
00:12:10.411 --> 00:12:12.896
YOU'LL NEED TO DISROBE
BEFORE YOU ENTER THE RESORT.


204
00:12:12.931 --> 00:12:14.035
I CAN SHOW YOU TO
THE LOCKER ROOMS--


205
00:12:14.070 --> 00:12:15.623
I'M JUST GONNA STOP
YOU RIGHT THERE.


206
00:12:15.657 --> 00:12:17.004
WE'RE NOT TAKING
OFF OUR CLOTHES!


207
00:12:17.038 --> 00:12:18.868
SO, HOW ELSE TO YOU
WANT TO GO ABOUT THIS?


208
00:12:18.902 --> 00:12:20.455
I MEAN, WE'RE NOT
HERE TO JUDGE YOU


209
00:12:20.490 --> 00:12:21.905
OR YOUR LIFE CHOICES
OR WHATEVER,


210
00:12:21.940 --> 00:12:24.011
BUT THAT'S EXACTLY
- A CHOICE.


211
00:12:24.045 --> 00:12:26.323
AND DEFINITELY NOT ONE
WE'RE WILLING TO MAKE.


212
00:12:26.358 --> 00:12:27.462
IT'S PRETTY
FUCKING WEIRD.


213
00:12:27.497 --> 00:12:28.808
NO OFFENSE.

214
00:12:28.843 --> 00:12:31.190
GIRLS, THE BEAR LAKE
NATURIST RESORT


215
00:12:31.225 --> 00:12:33.883
IS A PLACE WHERE PEOPLE PAY
TO COME AND BE SOCIALLY NUDE


216
00:12:33.917 --> 00:12:36.023
IN AN ACCEPTING
ATMOSPHERE.


217
00:12:36.057 --> 00:12:37.921
AND THE BY-LAWS
OF THE RESORT STATE


218
00:12:37.956 --> 00:12:40.199
THAT NO ONE CAN BE CLOTHED
BEYOND THIS POINT,


219
00:12:40.234 --> 00:12:42.857
FOR THE COMFORT AND
SAFETY OF ALL GUESTS.


220
00:12:42.892 --> 00:12:44.894
THERE'S NO EXCEPTION
TO THIS RULE?


221
00:12:44.928 --> 00:12:46.826
RIGHT! EVEN IF YOU'RE JUST HERE
TO PICKUP YOUR DEAD DAD'S SHIT?


222
00:12:46.861 --> 00:12:49.450
NO, REALLY, KRISTI, WE JUST NEED
TO TAKE CARE OF A FEW THINGS.


223
00:12:49.484 --> 00:12:52.487
I'M SORRY.
RULES ARE RULES.


224
00:12:52.522 --> 00:12:55.628
TEXTILES ARE NOT PERMITTED
BEYOND THIS VISITOR'S CENTER.


225
00:12:55.663 --> 00:12:57.699
UN
-FUCKING
-REAL.

226
00:12:57.734 --> 00:13:00.323
WAIT, DID I JUST HEAR
SOMEONE SAY THERE'S A POOL?


227
00:13:00.357 --> 00:13:02.877
YEAH, WE HAVE
AN AMAZING POOL, AND--


228
00:13:02.912 --> 00:13:05.811
GREAT. JUST SHOW US
TO THE LOCKER ROOM.


229
00:13:05.845 --> 00:13:08.124
ALRIGHT, FOLLOW ME.

230
00:13:08.158 --> 00:13:09.504
YO, WHAT ARE
YOU DOING?!


231
00:13:09.539 --> 00:13:11.541
IT'S FINE! I HAVE A PLAN.
C'MON.


232
00:13:14.578 --> 00:13:15.994
OH, UH, I THINK WE
SHOULD PROBABLY GO


233
00:13:16.028 --> 00:13:17.961
GET OUR BAGS OUT
OF THE CAR. RIGHT?


234
00:13:17.996 --> 00:13:20.136
WHAT IS YOUR
BRILLIANT PLAN?


235
00:13:20.170 --> 00:13:21.171
HOLD ON...

236
00:13:23.139 --> 00:13:24.140
WHAT?

237
00:13:24.174 --> 00:13:25.865
HELLO...

238
00:13:25.900 --> 00:13:27.488
SO YOU HAVE
A FOOFY TOWEL.


239
00:13:27.522 --> 00:13:28.730
SO WHAT?

240
00:13:28.765 --> 00:13:29.697
OH MY GOD.

241
00:13:29.731 --> 00:13:30.940
CHARLIE, FOCUS
WITH ME FOR A SECOND.


242
00:13:30.974 --> 00:13:32.527
THEY'RE OBVIOUSLY NOT GONNA
LET US WEAR CLOTHES, RIGHT?


243
00:13:32.562 --> 00:13:33.597
YEAH.

244
00:13:33.632 --> 00:13:35.634
BUT THERE'S A POOL, SO
WE CAN JUST WEAR TOWELS!


245
00:13:35.668 --> 00:13:36.842
I MEAN,
PROBLEM SOLVED.


246
00:13:36.876 --> 00:13:38.499
I DON'T HAVE
ONE OF THOSE.


247
00:13:38.533 --> 00:13:40.294
I'M PRETTY SURE
WE'RE IN A LOCKER ROOM.


248
00:13:40.328 --> 00:13:41.916
EW.

249
00:13:41.951 --> 00:13:43.745
IT'S EITHER THAT
OR NOTHING.


250
00:13:43.780 --> 00:13:45.782
LITERALLY.
SO TAKE YOUR PICK.


251
00:13:54.066 --> 00:13:55.619
YOUR'S VELCRO'S?

252
00:13:55.654 --> 00:13:57.794
COOL, HUH?

253
00:13:57.828 --> 00:13:59.830
PACKING LIGHT DOESN'T
ALWAYS COME IN HANDY.


254
00:14:01.798 --> 00:14:03.075
ARE YOU
GONNA CHANGE?


255
00:14:03.110 --> 00:14:05.457
YEAH. BUT...
TURN AROUND.


256
00:14:05.491 --> 00:14:07.010
COME ON.

257
00:14:07.045 --> 00:14:08.632
TURN AROUND!

258
00:14:08.667 --> 00:14:11.049
ARE YOU IN 7TH GRADE?
MY GOD!


259
00:14:16.640 --> 00:14:17.641
READY!

260
00:14:22.508 --> 00:14:23.509
LET'S GO!

261
00:14:25.063 --> 00:14:26.167
ARE YOU COMING?

262
00:14:26.202 --> 00:14:27.237
YEAH.

263
00:14:32.380 --> 00:14:33.795
A LITTLE HELP,
MAYBE?


264
00:14:33.830 --> 00:14:35.211
WHAT WAS THAT
ABOUT PACKING LIGHT?


265
00:14:37.627 --> 00:14:38.455
THANKS.

266
00:14:48.638 --> 00:14:50.847
UH, THAT'S
NOT REALLY--


267
00:14:50.881 --> 00:14:52.642
I KNOW.
AND, I'M SORRY.


268
00:14:52.676 --> 00:14:54.333
WE'RE REALLY NOT TRYING TO MAKE
A BIG DEAL OUT OF THIS,


269
00:14:54.368 --> 00:14:56.128
BUT SINCE THERE'S A POOL,
AND PEOPLE WEAR TOWELS,


270
00:14:56.163 --> 00:14:58.165
WE'LL FIT
RIGHT IN.


271
00:14:58.199 --> 00:15:00.650
SO PLEASE... JUST TAKE
US TO SEE RUSTY?


272
00:15:01.651 --> 00:15:05.344
UM, I GET THE FEELING YOU'RE
NOT GOING TO BACK DOWN,


273
00:15:05.379 --> 00:15:09.590
SO I WILL ALLOW THIS...
FOR THE NEXT COUPLE OF HOURS.


274
00:15:09.624 --> 00:15:10.763
IF YOU STAY ANY
LONGER THAN THAT,


275
00:15:10.798 --> 00:15:12.489
YOU'LL NEED TO DISROBE
LIKE EVERYONE ELSE.


276
00:15:12.524 --> 00:15:13.180
IT'S A DEAL.

277
00:15:13.214 --> 00:15:14.077
NO IT ISN'T!

278
00:15:14.112 --> 00:15:15.872
WE'RE NOT GOING TO
BE HERE THAT LONG.


279
00:15:15.906 --> 00:15:18.875
OK, OH, HOW ABOUT YOU LEAVE
YOUR SUITCASES HERE?


280
00:15:18.909 --> 00:15:19.841
GREAT.

281
00:15:19.876 --> 00:15:21.498
OK, LET'S
GET GOING.


282
00:15:21.533 --> 00:15:23.190
I DON'T WANT TO LEAVE
MY STUFF HERE.


283
00:15:23.224 --> 00:15:26.227
HELLO! NUDIES AREN'T
GONNA STEAL YOUR CLOTHES.


284
00:15:27.918 --> 00:15:28.747
COME ON!

285
00:15:31.715 --> 00:15:33.338
THIS IS
RUSTY'S CABIN.


286
00:15:33.372 --> 00:15:35.202
I'LL BE WAITING
RIGHT HERE FOR YOU.


287
00:15:38.239 --> 00:15:41.311
HELLO, THERE.
RUSTY CARTER.


288
00:15:41.346 --> 00:15:42.692
PLEASED TO MEET YOU.

289
00:15:42.726 --> 00:15:44.280
WHO WANTS A DRINK?!

290
00:15:44.314 --> 00:15:45.350
NO THANKS.

291
00:15:45.384 --> 00:15:46.696
FINE,
MORE FOR ME.


292
00:15:46.730 --> 00:15:48.560
HAVE A SEAT,
YOUNG LADIES.


293
00:15:51.666 --> 00:15:54.048
SO IT'S A REAL PLEASURE
TO MEET NED'S DAUGHTER.


294
00:15:54.083 --> 00:15:55.463
WHICH OF YOU DID I SPEAK
TO ON THE PHONE?


295
00:15:55.498 --> 00:15:57.327
THAT'D BE ME.
CHARLIE TILLERMAN.


296
00:15:57.362 --> 00:15:59.502
CHARLIE, YOUR DAD
WAS A GOOD GUY.


297
00:15:59.536 --> 00:16:02.125
HE WAS,
WASN'T HE.


298
00:16:02.160 --> 00:16:03.782
OH, I'M SORRY,
WE'VE NEVER SPOKEN.


299
00:16:03.816 --> 00:16:05.646
I'M LEAH,
NED'S DAUGHTER.


300
00:16:07.544 --> 00:16:08.545
THERE'S TWO
OF YOU?


301
00:16:08.580 --> 00:16:09.891
WELL, THERE'S ONLY ONE
BIOLOGICAL DAUGHTER...


302
00:16:09.926 --> 00:16:11.341
AND THAT'S ME.

303
00:16:11.376 --> 00:16:13.136
THAT'S CORRECT, BUT THERE'S
ONLY ONE DAUGHTER


304
00:16:13.171 --> 00:16:15.069
THAT HE RAISED...
AND THAT'S ME.


305
00:16:15.104 --> 00:16:16.864
I'M SORRY.

306
00:16:16.898 --> 00:16:18.141
HE NEVER MENTIONED
EITHER ONE OF YOU,


307
00:16:18.176 --> 00:16:20.488
EXCEPT IN THE WILL.

308
00:16:20.523 --> 00:16:22.525
THERE'S A LOT OF
LEGAL JARGON ON HERE;


309
00:16:22.559 --> 00:16:25.838
FOR THE SAKE OF TIME
WE'LL JUST SKIP OVER IT.


310
00:16:25.873 --> 00:16:26.839
GREAT.

311
00:16:26.874 --> 00:16:29.532
NO, I THINK IT'D BE
BEST IF WE HEARD IT ALL.


312
00:16:29.566 --> 00:16:31.430
IT'S OK,
WE HAVE TIME.


313
00:16:31.465 --> 00:16:34.330
WELL, THERE'S REALLY ONLY
TWO MAIN ARTICLES OF NOTE.


314
00:16:34.364 --> 00:16:36.332
NED WANTED
TO BE CREMATED.


315
00:16:36.366 --> 00:16:38.472
AND HE'D LIKE HIS ASHES
TO BE SPREAD AROUND THIS AREA.


316
00:16:38.506 --> 00:16:40.439
HEY, SO, HAS HE ALREADY
BEEN COOKED OR WHAT?


317
00:16:40.474 --> 00:16:44.202
NO, WE'VE GOT HIM IN STORAGE
DOWN AT THE MORGUE IN TOWN.


318
00:16:44.236 --> 00:16:47.136
IF BE COULD BACK UP FOR
A SECOND, BRIEF ASIDE:


319
00:16:47.170 --> 00:16:48.896
WHAT HAPPENED
TO HIM?


320
00:16:48.930 --> 00:16:50.380
OH WOW.

321
00:16:50.415 --> 00:16:51.830
SKIPPED RIGHT OVER THAT,
DIDN'T I?


322
00:16:51.864 --> 00:16:52.796
YES, YOU DID.

323
00:16:52.831 --> 00:16:53.659
IT'S THE SCOTCH.

324
00:16:54.729 --> 00:16:57.180
WELL, NED WAS WORKING
WITH A BUDDY


325
00:16:57.215 --> 00:17:00.632
ON A MOTORBOAT HERE
AT THE RESORT.


326
00:17:00.666 --> 00:17:03.186
THEY THOUGHT THE ENGINE
WAS OUT OF GEAR--


327
00:17:03.221 --> 00:17:07.363
WELL, IT STARTED AND THE
PROPELLER BURIED ITSELF


328
00:17:07.397 --> 00:17:09.848
IN THE MIDDLE OF
HIS SPINAL CORD.


329
00:17:09.882 --> 00:17:14.335
HE DIED INSTANTLY.

330
00:17:14.370 --> 00:17:17.545
POOR BASTARD.

331
00:17:17.580 --> 00:17:20.583
DO WE NEED TO GO TO THE MORGUE
AND GET HIM PREPARED?


332
00:17:22.101 --> 00:17:23.379
RUSTY!

333
00:17:23.413 --> 00:17:24.449
YEAH.

334
00:17:24.483 --> 00:17:26.796
FIRST THING
MONDAY MORNING.


335
00:17:26.830 --> 00:17:28.487
WHAT?!

336
00:17:28.522 --> 00:17:30.351
WELL THE MORTICIAN
IS OUT OF TOWN.


337
00:17:30.386 --> 00:17:31.732
WHERE IS HE?

338
00:17:31.766 --> 00:17:34.010
HE'S ON
A FISHING TRIP.


339
00:17:34.044 --> 00:17:35.184
THIS IS
ABSOLUTELY INSANE.


340
00:17:35.218 --> 00:17:36.840
THERE'S OTHER PEOPLE
THAT WORK AT THE MORGUE.


341
00:17:36.875 --> 00:17:38.014
CAN'T SOMEONE ELSE
LET US IN?


342
00:17:38.048 --> 00:17:39.498
RIGHT! WE DON'T
LIVE AROUND HERE.


343
00:17:39.533 --> 00:17:40.672
WHERE ARE
WE GONNA STAY?


344
00:17:40.706 --> 00:17:42.121
YOU CAN STAY HERE,
I IMAGINE.


345
00:17:42.156 --> 00:17:43.364
NO, IT'S NOT EVEN
AN OPTION.


346
00:17:43.399 --> 00:17:44.952
I HAVE TO BE BACK IN MIAMI
MONDAY MORNING FOR A MEETING.


347
00:17:44.986 --> 00:17:46.540
I CANNOT MISS
THIS MEETING!


348
00:17:46.574 --> 00:17:48.162
SO WHAT DID NED DO
WHEN HE WAS HERE?


349
00:17:48.197 --> 00:17:50.026
YOU KNOW, OTHER
THAN GET KILLED.


350
00:17:52.511 --> 00:17:53.926
WHAT IS
SO FUNNY?


351
00:17:56.550 --> 00:18:01.348
I JUST THOUGHT YOU'D BE
A LITTLE LESS ANTAGONISTIC


352
00:18:01.382 --> 00:18:04.143
WHEN YOU FOUND OUT
YOU OWN THE PLACE.


353
00:18:04.178 --> 00:18:06.007
WE OWN ONE OF THESE
LITTLE CABINS?


354
00:18:06.042 --> 00:18:08.493
ALL OF BEAR LAKE.
HE LEFT IT TO YOU.


355
00:18:08.527 --> 00:18:09.528
GET...OUT!

356
00:18:12.704 --> 00:18:14.292
THAT GUY HASN'T
SEEN ME IN TWO DECADES,


357
00:18:14.326 --> 00:18:15.776
AND NOW HE'S TRYING TO MAKE UP
FOR IT BY LEAVING ME


358
00:18:15.810 --> 00:18:17.260
A FUCKING
NUDIST COLONY?!


359
00:18:17.295 --> 00:18:19.676
NUDIST RESORT.
COLONIES ARE FOR LEPERS.


360
00:18:19.711 --> 00:18:23.680
YOU'RE TELLING ME RIGHT NOW THAT
MY DAD OWNED THIS ENTIRE PLACE?


361
00:18:23.715 --> 00:18:25.544
TECHNICALLY,
UNTIL NOW.


362
00:18:27.512 --> 00:18:31.895
THE WILL STATES THAT
SOLE PROPRIETORSHIP


363
00:18:31.930 --> 00:18:36.037
SHALL BE PASSED DIRECTLY
TO QUOTE DAUGHTER UNQUOTE.


364
00:18:36.072 --> 00:18:37.556
THAT'S ME!

365
00:18:37.591 --> 00:18:38.523
ARE YOU HIGH?

366
00:18:38.557 --> 00:18:40.041
THAT IS MOST
DEFINITELY NOT YOU!


367
00:18:40.076 --> 00:18:41.353
IT'S BOTH OF YOU.

368
00:18:41.388 --> 00:18:42.354
WELL, I'M BLOOD!

369
00:18:42.389 --> 00:18:43.079
HE DOESN'T
KNOW HER.


370
00:18:43.113 --> 00:18:44.253
I'M HIS DAUGHTER!

371
00:18:45.046 --> 00:18:47.463
WELL, TECHNICALLY
YOU'RE BOTH RIGHT.


372
00:18:47.497 --> 00:18:50.293
WHILE CHARLIE IS HIS
BIOLOGICAL DAUGHTER,


373
00:18:50.328 --> 00:18:53.676
LEAH IS HIS DAUGHTER
THROUGH COMMON LAW ADOPTION.


374
00:18:53.710 --> 00:18:55.885
SO, I FIND THAT THE ESTATE
SHALL BE DIVIDED


375
00:18:55.919 --> 00:18:57.852
BETWEEN THE
TWO OF YOU.


376
00:18:57.887 --> 00:18:58.888
BEAUTIFUL!

377
00:19:00.269 --> 00:19:04.273
I LIKE THE TOWELS.
NICE TOUCH.


378
00:19:08.104 --> 00:19:09.968
ARE YOU
ON NITROUS?


379
00:19:10.002 --> 00:19:14.317
I JUST CAN'T BELIEVE NED'S
DAUGHTERS ARE SO UPTIGHT!


380
00:19:14.352 --> 00:19:17.976
ANYWAY, WE'RE GONNA
SIGN ALL THE PAPERS,


381
00:19:18.010 --> 00:19:21.600
AND SIGN THE DEED OVER AS SOON
AS YOU TAKE CARE OF HIS ASHES.


382
00:19:23.602 --> 00:19:25.604
THIS FUCKIN' SUCKS.
I'M OUT OF HERE.


383
00:19:26.018 --> 00:19:27.054
CHARLIE, HEY!

384
00:19:34.475 --> 00:19:36.166
UM, CAN I USE THIS?

385
00:19:36.201 --> 00:19:37.375
YEAH.

386
00:19:37.409 --> 00:19:39.066
I'M GONNA GIVE YOU MY NUMBER
AND IF YOU HEAR FROM BILLY


387
00:19:39.100 --> 00:19:42.828
BEFORE MONDAY MORNING,
YOU KNOW WHERE TO REACH ME.


388
00:19:42.863 --> 00:19:44.002
IT WAS NICE
TO MEET YOU.


389
00:19:44.036 --> 00:19:45.072
LIKEWISE.

390
00:19:51.423 --> 00:19:55.047
WELL, NOW THAT YOU'RE
AWARE OF EVERYTHING,


391
00:19:55.082 --> 00:19:56.325
HOW ABOUT I TAKE YOU ON
THE GRAND TOUR?


392
00:19:56.359 --> 00:19:57.809
PLEASE.

393
00:19:57.843 --> 00:19:59.673
GREAT!
LET'S GET STARTED.


394
00:20:06.231 --> 00:20:07.646
THIS IS THE
CABIN AREA.


395
00:20:07.681 --> 00:20:10.097
WE HAVE FIFTEEN ROOMS -
LET ME SHOW YOU THIS ONE!


396
00:20:15.551 --> 00:20:20.003
SO, THERE'S EITHER ONE OR
TWO BEDS - THIS ONE HAS ONE -


397
00:20:20.038 --> 00:20:23.144
HEATER, AIR CONDITIONER,
A NIGHT SIDE TABLE, LAMP...


398
00:20:23.179 --> 00:20:25.630
WHAT DO
YOU THINK?


399
00:20:25.664 --> 00:20:28.046
NICE.

400
00:20:28.080 --> 00:20:29.875
HANGERS?
REALLY?


401
00:20:29.910 --> 00:20:32.361
EVERYBODY ARRIVES
IN CLOTHES.


402
00:20:36.261 --> 00:20:38.677
WHOA! YOU DO NOT
SEE THAT EVERYDAY.


403
00:20:43.889 --> 00:20:46.478
THIS IS OUR GIFT SHOP,
"BARE NECESSITIES."


404
00:20:46.513 --> 00:20:47.410
AND THIS
IS NATALIE!


405
00:20:47.445 --> 00:20:48.411
WELCOME!
HI!


406
00:20:51.380 --> 00:20:53.485
YOU GUYS SELL T-SHIRTS
AT A NUDIST RESORT?


407
00:20:53.520 --> 00:20:54.866
WE'RE SELLING
THEM IRONICALLY.


408
00:20:54.900 --> 00:20:56.454
OH, SO IF WE GET ONE FROM HERE,
WE CAN WEAR IT?


409
00:20:56.488 --> 00:20:57.351
NO.

410
00:21:02.356 --> 00:21:06.636
WELL, THIS IS OUR INCREDIBLE
POOL, HOT TUB, AND SAUNA.


411
00:21:06.671 --> 00:21:08.051
THERE AREN'T
MANY PEOPLE HERE...


412
00:21:08.086 --> 00:21:10.088
IS THIS JUST
A SLOW DAY?


413
00:21:10.122 --> 00:21:12.711
IT'S BEEN KIND OF
A SLOW SEASON.


414
00:21:12.746 --> 00:21:14.230
SO HOW DO YOU
STAY A FLOAT?


415
00:21:14.264 --> 00:21:16.059
NUDIST RESORTS ARE ACTUALLY
A GROWING INDUSTRY


416
00:21:16.094 --> 00:21:17.164
IN THE UNITED STATES.

417
00:21:17.198 --> 00:21:19.166
THEY MAKE AS MUCH
AS $300,000 A YEAR.


418
00:21:19.200 --> 00:21:20.443
OH SNAP,
I'M RICH!


419
00:21:20.478 --> 00:21:22.445
YEAH,
THAT'S NOT US.


420
00:21:22.480 --> 00:21:24.343
HOW MUCH DOES
THIS ONE MAKE?


421
00:21:24.378 --> 00:21:26.380
WE CAN GET INTO
ALL THAT LATER.


422
00:21:29.107 --> 00:21:32.144
LAUREN, THESE ARE
NED'S DAUGHTERS,


423
00:21:32.179 --> 00:21:34.043
LEAH & CHARLIE.

424
00:21:34.077 --> 00:21:36.494
OH, WOW, HI.

425
00:21:38.288 --> 00:21:41.222
LAUREN IS, OBVIOUSLY,
OUR LIFEGUARD


426
00:21:41.257 --> 00:21:42.396
AND THE HEAD OF
FITNESS ACTIVITIES.


427
00:21:42.431 --> 00:21:44.433
YOUR YOGA CLASSES
ARE THE BEST.


428
00:21:47.056 --> 00:21:51.543
GOD, YOU REALLY LOOK
SO MUCH LIKE HIM.


429
00:21:51.578 --> 00:21:54.443
OH, NO, I'M ACTUALLY NOT
HIS BIOLOGICAL DAUGHTER.


430
00:21:54.477 --> 00:21:55.444
I AM.

431
00:21:55.478 --> 00:21:57.307
OH. I DIDN'T...
UM...


432
00:21:59.655 --> 00:22:01.726
WHAT, I BETTER
DO THIS.


433
00:22:01.760 --> 00:22:02.899
WE WILL LEAVE YOU
TO YOUR JOB.


434
00:22:02.934 --> 00:22:04.763
WE'VE GOT SO MUCH MORE
TO SEE; LET'S GO!


435
00:22:08.767 --> 00:22:11.494
AND THIS IS WHERE
EVERYONE SHOWERS.


436
00:22:11.529 --> 00:22:13.496
WE HAVE TO SHOWER
WITH OTHER PEOPLE TOO?


437
00:22:13.531 --> 00:22:14.393
YUP!

438
00:22:16.844 --> 00:22:18.536
ALRIGHT, NOW THAT'S
SOME KOOKIE SHIT.


439
00:22:18.570 --> 00:22:19.433
NO KIDDING.

440
00:22:22.850 --> 00:22:25.681
AH, AND THIS IS OUR
RESTAURANT, UDISTS.


441
00:22:25.715 --> 00:22:27.683
WE SERVE THREE
DELICIOUS MEALS A DAY


442
00:22:27.717 --> 00:22:29.478
COURTESY OF OUR
WONDERFUL CHEF, CORY,


443
00:22:29.512 --> 00:22:30.755
WHOM YOU'VE--

444
00:22:30.789 --> 00:22:32.826
IS HE THAT ADORABLE GAY GUY
WHO'S SURPRISINGLY WELL HUNG?


445
00:22:32.860 --> 00:22:37.969
WE DON'T CONDONE GAWKING
AT EACH OTHER'S GENITALS.


446
00:22:38.003 --> 00:22:40.281
BUT YES,
THAT'S HIM.


447
00:22:40.316 --> 00:22:43.388
THE MENU CHANGES
DAILY--YOU'LL LOVE IT.


448
00:22:43.422 --> 00:22:45.355
YOU GUYS DO HAVE A
LIQUOR LICENSE, RIGHT?


449
00:22:45.390 --> 00:22:49.014
YUP. RIGHT ACROSS THE WAY
AT OUR BAR, "FIESTA CANTINA".


450
00:22:49.049 --> 00:22:49.843
THAT'S YOUR
LAST ONE, OK.


451
00:22:49.877 --> 00:22:50.706
OK.

452
00:22:51.810 --> 00:22:53.156
THIS IS TREVOR.

453
00:22:53.191 --> 00:22:58.196
TREVOR, THESE ARE NED'S
DAUGHTERS CHARLIE AND LEAH.


454
00:23:00.267 --> 00:23:01.544
HI.

455
00:23:01.579 --> 00:23:03.339
HEY.

456
00:23:03.373 --> 00:23:07.619
I'M... REALLY SORRY
ABOUT NED.


457
00:23:07.654 --> 00:23:10.795
HE WAS A REALLY
GREAT GUY.


458
00:23:10.829 --> 00:23:14.143
AND... ONE OF MY
REGULARS HERE.


459
00:23:14.177 --> 00:23:15.178
I CAN SEE WHY.

460
00:23:17.974 --> 00:23:21.978
I MEAN... BECAUSE...
THIS BAR IS AWESOME!


461
00:23:22.013 --> 00:23:24.118
THAT CONCLUDES
OUR TOUR.


462
00:23:24.153 --> 00:23:26.120
HOPE YOU
ENJOYED IT.


463
00:23:26.155 --> 00:23:29.399
YEAH. IT WAS EXTREMELY
ENLIGHTENING.


464
00:23:29.434 --> 00:23:30.884
SHOULD I SHOW YOU
BACK TO YOUR CABIN?


465
00:23:30.918 --> 00:23:33.196
I THINK WE CAN FIND IT
ON OUR OWN.


466
00:23:33.231 --> 00:23:36.337
YEAH. I THINK WE JUST NEED A FEW
MINUTES TO TAKE THIS ALL IN.


467
00:23:36.372 --> 00:23:39.651
SO IF YOU NEED ANYTHING AT ALL,
DON'T HESITATE TO ASK ME.


468
00:23:39.686 --> 00:23:41.032
WE WON'T.

469
00:23:41.066 --> 00:23:41.895
THANK YOU.

470
00:23:43.034 --> 00:23:44.035
UM, LET'S GO.

471
00:23:45.243 --> 00:23:46.693
BYE, LEAH.

472
00:23:46.727 --> 00:23:47.625
BYE!

473
00:23:47.659 --> 00:23:48.522
CAN I HAVE
A DRINK?


474
00:23:48.557 --> 00:23:50.524
YEAH, YEAH, DEFINITELY!
LET'S HAVE TWO!


475
00:23:50.559 --> 00:23:51.767
I DON'T KNOW
WHY I'M LAUGHING.


476
00:23:51.801 --> 00:23:54.045
WE HAVE TO SPEND THE WHOLE
WEEKEND IN THIS INSANE ASYLUM.


477
00:23:54.079 --> 00:23:56.150
I JUST
DON'T GET IT.


478
00:23:56.185 --> 00:23:59.015
WHY WOULD ANYONE WANT
TO LIVE LIKE THIS?


479
00:24:00.638 --> 00:24:02.881
THIS IS WHY I LIKE PORN--

480
00:24:02.916 --> 00:24:04.780
BECAUSE WHEN I'M SICK
OF LOOKING AT BALLS,


481
00:24:04.814 --> 00:24:06.195
I CAN JUST
TURN IT OFF.


482
00:24:06.229 --> 00:24:07.506
I KNOW!

483
00:24:07.541 --> 00:24:09.336
I MEAN, I DON'T
REALLY KNOW, BUT STILL,


484
00:24:09.370 --> 00:24:11.476
LIKE, MY DAD WOULDN'T
EVEN LET ME WEAR A BIKINI.


485
00:24:11.510 --> 00:24:13.512
SO HOW WAS HE
OK WITH THIS?


486
00:24:16.343 --> 00:24:17.689
I REALLY NEED SOME
HAND SANITIZER.


487
00:24:17.724 --> 00:24:19.726
LET'S JUST GET
BACK TO THE CABIN.


488
00:24:27.285 --> 00:24:29.114
LET'S GET
OUT OF HERE.


489
00:24:37.019 --> 00:24:39.366
WHAT ARE
YOU DOING?


490
00:24:39.400 --> 00:24:41.161
MAN, IF WE GOTTA BE AT
NUDIE CAMP UNTIL MONDAY,


491
00:24:41.195 --> 00:24:44.509
I'M AT LEAST GONNA SEE IF
THERE'S CIVILIZATION NEARBY.


492
00:24:44.543 --> 00:24:46.062
CIVILIZATION?

493
00:24:46.097 --> 00:24:47.477
HAVE YOU LOOKED AROUND?

494
00:24:47.512 --> 00:24:49.031
I LOOKED GOOGLED THIS PLACE
BEFORE WE GO HERE,


495
00:24:49.065 --> 00:24:50.826
AND WE'RE IN LIKE

496
00:24:50.860 --> 00:24:51.827
OH MY GOD.

497
00:24:51.861 --> 00:24:53.552
DID YOU BRING ME TO
THE BERMUDA TRIANGLE?


498
00:24:53.587 --> 00:24:55.693
IT'S LIKE
"THE HILLS HAVE EYES".


499
00:24:55.727 --> 00:24:57.246
UGH, SUCKS.

500
00:24:57.280 --> 00:24:59.213
THERE'S GOTTA BE
A DIVE BAR SOMEWHERE.


501
00:24:59.248 --> 00:25:00.905
BELIEVE ME,
I CHECKED.


502
00:25:00.939 --> 00:25:02.251
MAYBE A
LIQUOR STORE?


503
00:25:02.285 --> 00:25:04.115
PLEASE GOD LET THERE
BE A LIQUOR STORE.


504
00:25:07.739 --> 00:25:09.361
YOU COMING?

505
00:25:09.396 --> 00:25:11.053
NO, I THINK
I'LL STAY.


506
00:25:11.087 --> 00:25:14.504
ALRIGHT.
SUIT YOURSELF.


507
00:25:14.539 --> 00:25:16.541
SO, YOU
WANT ANYTHING?


508
00:25:16.575 --> 00:25:19.130
SOMETHING TO MAKE ME FORGET
TODAY EVER HAPPENED?


509
00:25:19.164 --> 00:25:19.993
DONE.

510
00:25:26.275 --> 00:25:28.864
YOU OK?

511
00:25:28.898 --> 00:25:31.038
I JUST FEEL LIKE I'M
GOING CRAZY, YOU KNOW?


512
00:25:31.073 --> 00:25:32.557
LIKE, HOW DOES
SOMEONE COME TO THIS?


513
00:25:32.591 --> 00:25:34.076
I FEEL LIKE MOST OTHER DADS
ARE CONTENT TO JUST SIT


514
00:25:34.110 --> 00:25:36.250
IN FRONT OF THE TV WITH
A BEER IN THEIR UNDERWEAR...


515
00:25:36.285 --> 00:25:39.253
I'M SURE YOUR DAD SAT IN
FRONT OF THE TV WITH A BEER...


516
00:25:39.288 --> 00:25:41.221
JUST WITHOUT
THE UNDERWEAR.


517
00:25:41.255 --> 00:25:42.843
THANKS FOR
THAT IMAGE.


518
00:25:42.878 --> 00:25:44.673
SORRY.

519
00:25:44.707 --> 00:25:45.501
I'M GONNA
HEAD OUT.


520
00:25:45.535 --> 00:25:46.916
GOOD LUCK MAKING
IT OUT CLOTHED.


521
00:25:52.888 --> 00:25:54.717
GOD, WHAT DID YOU
SEE IN THIS PLACE?


522
00:25:57.375 --> 00:25:59.411
HEY CHARLIE!

523
00:25:59.446 --> 00:26:02.069
THAT DOESN'T LOOK
LIKE A TOWEL TO ME...


524
00:26:02.104 --> 00:26:04.796
DO YOU HAVE
A LIGHT?


525
00:26:04.831 --> 00:26:06.246
HERE YOU GO.

526
00:26:06.280 --> 00:26:07.730
THANK YOU.

527
00:26:07.765 --> 00:26:10.008
WOULD YOU LIKE A COLD
DRINK WITH THAT?


528
00:26:10.043 --> 00:26:11.216
YOU GOT
A BEER?


529
00:26:11.251 --> 00:26:12.252
YEAH,
SIT DOWN!


530
00:26:21.157 --> 00:26:22.400
HERE YOU ARE.

531
00:26:22.434 --> 00:26:23.263
THANKS.

532
00:26:30.995 --> 00:26:33.791
SO, UM, HOW LONG HAVE
YOU LIVED HERE?


533
00:26:33.825 --> 00:26:37.380
WELL, MY PARENTS BOUGHT
THIS PLACE IN THE LATE 60S.


534
00:26:37.415 --> 00:26:39.589
WHOA, THAT MEANS
YOU GREW UP HERE.


535
00:26:39.624 --> 00:26:43.524
GOD, THAT'S CRAZY.
WHAT WAS THAT LIKE?


536
00:26:43.559 --> 00:26:45.319
NOT AS COOL AS SOME
PEOPLE MIGHT THINK.


537
00:26:45.354 --> 00:26:47.908
I MEAN, IT WAS GREAT
AS A CHILD...


538
00:26:47.943 --> 00:26:50.531
IT'S JUST A LITTLE STRANGE
WHEN YOU HIT PUBERTY.


539
00:26:50.566 --> 00:26:52.326
BUT WHEN I WENT
OFF TO COLLEGE,


540
00:26:52.361 --> 00:26:54.777
I REALIZED THE APPLE DIDN'T
FALL TOO FAR FROM THE TREE.


541
00:26:54.812 --> 00:26:58.022
I WAS ALL ABOUT BEING
NAKED IN MY APARTMENT.


542
00:26:58.056 --> 00:27:00.162
WHICH REALLY
BOTHERED MY ROOMMATE...


543
00:27:00.196 --> 00:27:03.199
BUT IT DIDN'T SEEM TO BOTHER
HER BOYFRIEND THAT MUCH.


544
00:27:04.407 --> 00:27:05.754
WELL, WHEN YOU WENT
TO SCHOOL THOUGH...


545
00:27:05.788 --> 00:27:07.065
I MEAN, YOU HAD TO WEAR
CLOTHES THERE, RIGHT?


546
00:27:07.100 --> 00:27:08.342
YEAH.

547
00:27:08.377 --> 00:27:10.344
AND MY PARENTS
RAN A NUDIST RESORT,


548
00:27:10.379 --> 00:27:13.313
SO CLOTHING SHOPPING REALLY
WASN'T A BIG PRIORITY.


549
00:27:13.347 --> 00:27:15.902
IT WAS ALL HAND-ME-DOWNS
AND THE GOODWILL...


550
00:27:15.936 --> 00:27:18.905
AND I REALLY DIDN'T HAVE
A LOT WITH THE POPULARITY.


551
00:27:18.939 --> 00:27:21.493
GOD YEAH. I TOTALLY KNOW
WHAT THAT'S LIKE.


552
00:27:21.528 --> 00:27:24.807
PEOPLE USED TO MAKE FUN OF
ME A LOT IN HIGH SCHOOL TOO.


553
00:27:24.842 --> 00:27:26.913
I TRIED A BUNCH OF
DIFFERENT STYLES -


554
00:27:26.947 --> 00:27:30.813
LIKE I WAS GRUNGE, AND GOTH,
AND PUNK FOR A LITTLE BIT -


555
00:27:30.848 --> 00:27:34.092
IT REALLY DIDN'T
MATTER WHAT I WORE,


556
00:27:34.127 --> 00:27:36.301
PEOPLE STILL FOUND SOMETHING
WRONG WITH IT, YOU KNOW?


557
00:27:36.336 --> 00:27:37.509
I KNOW.

558
00:27:37.544 --> 00:27:40.512
SOMETIMES YOU JUST NEVER FIT
IN, NO MATTER WHAT YOU DO.


559
00:27:40.547 --> 00:27:43.757
ALL THAT ENDED WHEN I MOVED
BACK HERE MY JUNIOR YEAR.


560
00:27:43.792 --> 00:27:45.966
WHY DID YOU
MOVE BACK?


561
00:27:46.001 --> 00:27:47.830
I HAD
A BAD ACCIDENT.


562
00:27:48.520 --> 00:27:51.144
WHAT SORT
OF ACCIDENT?


563
00:27:51.178 --> 00:27:53.042
A FIRE.

564
00:27:53.077 --> 00:27:56.045
AND, WELL, YOU CAN SEE
HOW THAT TURNED OUT.


565
00:27:56.080 --> 00:27:59.048
AFTER MONTHS OF TREATMENT
AND MONTHS OF CRYING -


566
00:27:59.083 --> 00:28:01.775
I KNEW I HAD TO LEARN TO COME
TO TERMS WITH MY NEW SELF.


567
00:28:01.810 --> 00:28:04.226
IT WAS EITHER THAT,
OR BE VERY ANGRY...


568
00:28:04.260 --> 00:28:09.438
AND I FIGURED, WHAT BETTER PLACE
TO LEARN ACCEPTANCE THAN HERE?


569
00:28:09.472 --> 00:28:13.856
SO BECOMING A BURN VICTIM MADE
YOU TAKE OVER A NUDIST RESORT?


570
00:28:13.891 --> 00:28:15.547
HOW DOES THAT
MAKE SENSE?


571
00:28:15.582 --> 00:28:17.032
WELL... WHAT MADE ME
TAKE IT OVER


572
00:28:17.066 --> 00:28:20.035
WAS MY PARENTS MOVING TO
FLORIDA TO BE WITH MY GRANDMA.


573
00:28:20.069 --> 00:28:23.970
AND, THERE ARE
WORSE PLACES


574
00:28:24.004 --> 00:28:27.836
TO COME TO TERMS WITH YOUR
BODY-IMAGE, YOU KNOW?


575
00:28:30.424 --> 00:28:32.841
YEAH,
I CAN SEE THAT.


576
00:28:32.875 --> 00:28:34.601
THAT'S
PRETTY COOL.


577
00:28:34.635 --> 00:28:36.085
BUT IT WASN'T
ALL SELF-HEALING.


578
00:28:36.120 --> 00:28:36.914
THE FIRST
COUPLE YEARS


579
00:28:36.948 --> 00:28:38.260
I TREATED IT LIKE
A PAID VACATION.


580
00:28:38.294 --> 00:28:40.883
I ALMOST RAN THIS PLACE
INTO THE GROUND.


581
00:28:40.918 --> 00:28:43.265
THAT'S WHEN "GOOD OL' NED"
CAME INTO THE PICTURE, RIGHT?


582
00:28:43.299 --> 00:28:46.751
YEAH, AND MY PARENTS FULLY
EXPECTED HIM TO CONVERT IT


583
00:28:46.785 --> 00:28:49.340
INTO A SUMMER CAMP
OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT,


584
00:28:49.374 --> 00:28:52.205
BUT HE GAVE MY DAD HIS WORD
THAT HE'D KEEP IT AS IT WAS.


585
00:28:54.034 --> 00:28:56.968
SO, YOU SAID THIS
WAS A SLOW SEASON.


586
00:28:57.003 --> 00:28:59.074
IF THIS PLACE ISN'T
DOING GOOD BUSINESS--


587
00:28:59.108 --> 00:29:01.352
I DON'T WORRY
ABOUT THAT.


588
00:29:01.386 --> 00:29:05.701
BEAR LAKE IS MORE OF A HOME
THAN A BUSINESS, I'M JUST...


589
00:29:05.735 --> 00:29:07.737
I'M SO HAPPY
TO BE HERE.


590
00:29:13.951 --> 00:29:18.748
JOE WELLS...
CENTURY 21.


591
00:29:18.783 --> 00:29:20.578
IS THIS HIS OFFICE
OR CELL PHONE?


592
00:29:20.612 --> 00:29:23.684
OK. AND YOU'VE ALREADY SPOKEN
WITH HIM, RIGHT?


593
00:29:23.719 --> 00:29:26.756
AND HE'LL BE DISCREET?

594
00:29:26.791 --> 00:29:30.139
OK, I JUST, THIS DOES NOT
NEED TO BE PUBLIC KNOWLEDGE.


595
00:29:30.174 --> 00:29:32.901
OK, I WILL SEE YOU
NEXT WEEK THEN!


596
00:29:32.935 --> 00:29:34.972
THANKS AGAIN,
MAYA.


597
00:29:36.352 --> 00:29:39.493
YOU KNOW WHAT,
I HAVE TO GO. OK.


598
00:29:39.528 --> 00:29:40.529
JUST A SEC!

599
00:29:43.118 --> 00:29:43.946
COME IN.

600
00:29:45.603 --> 00:29:47.053
HI! LEAH, RIGHT?

601
00:29:47.087 --> 00:29:48.330
YEAH.

602
00:29:48.364 --> 00:29:49.607
WHAT'S UP?

603
00:29:49.641 --> 00:29:52.058
OH, I JUST BROUGHT YOU GUYS SOME
EXTRA BLANKETS AND TOWELS...


604
00:29:52.092 --> 00:29:53.576
IT GETS PRETTY COLD
HERE AT NIGHT.


605
00:29:53.611 --> 00:29:55.958
THANKS, THAT WAS
AWFULLY SWEET OF Y--


606
00:29:55.993 --> 00:29:57.684
HEY,
WHAT'S UP?


607
00:29:57.718 --> 00:29:59.720
KRISTI SENT ME
TO TAKE A LOOK AT YOUR HEATER.


608
00:29:59.755 --> 00:30:02.240
CODE YELLOW...
REPEAT, COLD YELLOW.


609
00:30:02.275 --> 00:30:04.173
YOU GUYS HAVE CODES?

610
00:30:04.208 --> 00:30:05.519
YEAH, WE GET BORED.

611
00:30:05.554 --> 00:30:07.038
EASILY.

612
00:30:07.073 --> 00:30:08.522
SO WHAT'S
A CODE YELLOW?


613
00:30:08.557 --> 00:30:09.661
IT'S A BROKEN
URINAL.


614
00:30:09.696 --> 00:30:10.697
NO, IT'S NOT!

615
00:30:10.731 --> 00:30:11.767
IT JUST MEANS THERE'S
A MAINTENANCE REQUEST


616
00:30:11.801 --> 00:30:12.768
IN THE YELLOW CABIN.

617
00:30:12.802 --> 00:30:15.081
C'MON... WE TOTALLY
COULD'VE HAD HER.


618
00:30:15.115 --> 00:30:21.225
DON'T YOU HAVE THAT DATE
NIGHT WITH YOUR HUSBAND?


619
00:30:21.259 --> 00:30:23.434
OH YEAH!
YEAH... I DID.


620
00:30:23.468 --> 00:30:24.918
YES...

621
00:30:24.953 --> 00:30:30.613
YEAH, UM, DUSTY'S COOKING ME...
MEATY LASAGNA BECAUSE IT'S...


622
00:30:30.648 --> 00:30:35.653
YOU KNOW, MY FAVORITE SO
HE'S DOING A SPECIAL THING.


623
00:30:36.067 --> 00:30:36.930
UMMM...

624
00:30:46.043 --> 00:30:46.871
MMMM...

625
00:30:48.045 --> 00:30:52.773
OH...UH, LEAH...
I'M UP HERE.


626
00:30:52.808 --> 00:30:54.154
I KNOW.

627
00:30:54.189 --> 00:30:57.054
NO, IT'S OK.

628
00:30:57.088 --> 00:30:59.366
I MEAN, I'M COOL WITH IT.
WE'RE ALL USED TO IT.


629
00:30:59.401 --> 00:31:00.919
COOL WITH WHAT?

630
00:31:00.954 --> 00:31:03.301
YOU WERE TOTALLY
STARING JUST THEN.


631
00:31:03.336 --> 00:31:05.062
NO I WASN'T.

632
00:31:05.096 --> 00:31:07.340
I'VE...
I'VE SEEN...


633
00:31:07.374 --> 00:31:08.824
I'VE SEEN SOME
OF THOSE BEFORE.


634
00:31:08.858 --> 00:31:11.033
WHATEVER MAKES YOU
FEEL COMFORTABLE.


635
00:31:11.068 --> 00:31:12.931
I'M COMFORTABLE.

636
00:31:12.966 --> 00:31:14.485
YOU'RE COMFORTABLE.

637
00:31:14.519 --> 00:31:15.831
I'M SO COOL WITH
THIS RIGHT NOW.


638
00:31:15.865 --> 00:31:17.488
YEAH, GO AHEAD,
TAKE A LOOK.


639
00:31:17.522 --> 00:31:19.007
IT'S GONNA HAVE TO BE
A LONG ONE BUT...


640
00:31:19.041 --> 00:31:20.387
I'M OK
WITH THAT.


641
00:31:20.422 --> 00:31:22.389
YEAH, NO, EYE CONTACT
IS ALWAYS GOOD.


642
00:31:22.424 --> 00:31:28.223
YEAH, UM, IT'S, WELL,
YEAH I KINDA FEEL DIRTY NOW.


643
00:31:28.257 --> 00:31:30.052
YOU SHOULDN'T.
IT'S TOTALLY HARMLESS.


644
00:31:30.087 --> 00:31:31.916
YEAH...
I MEAN...


645
00:31:36.714 --> 00:31:41.995
WELL, UM...I'M GLAD THAT
WASN'T AWKWARD.


646
00:31:42.030 --> 00:31:43.686
SO, I GOTTA GO.

647
00:31:43.721 --> 00:31:46.724
YOU KNOW, THAT HUSBAND
DINNER THING.


648
00:31:50.797 --> 00:31:54.352
SO UM, YOU'RE ALL SET
ON BLANKETS AND...


649
00:31:54.387 --> 00:31:56.837
YUP! ABSOLUTELY,
I'M TOTALLY FINE.


650
00:31:56.872 --> 00:31:59.737
I ACTUALLY DID HAVE
ONE QUESTION FOR YOU...


651
00:31:59.771 --> 00:32:01.014
UM, IS THERE A TIME WHEN
THE COMMUNAL SHOWERS


652
00:32:01.049 --> 00:32:04.328
AREN'T SO COMMUNAL?

653
00:32:04.362 --> 00:32:05.467
ACTUALLY TONIGHT
THERE'S A--


654
00:32:05.501 --> 00:32:07.331
SORRY. THERE'S A STAFF
MEETING AT 8,


655
00:32:07.365 --> 00:32:10.058
SO YOU'LL HAVE THE WHOLE
PLACE TO YOURSELF.


656
00:32:10.092 --> 00:32:12.543
AND JUST GET TO THE
YELLOW CABIN WHEN YOU'RE DONE.


657
00:32:12.577 --> 00:32:14.579
I MEAN, WHEN
YOU HAVE TIME.


658
00:32:18.928 --> 00:32:20.516
REPEAT, CODE YELLOW.

659
00:32:20.551 --> 00:32:22.380
THAT ACTUALLY SOUNDS,
PRETTY SERIOUS.


660
00:32:22.415 --> 00:32:23.278
I SHOULD--

661
00:32:23.312 --> 00:32:24.520
YOU SHOULD GO.
THAT'S WHY YOU GET PAID.


662
00:32:24.555 --> 00:32:26.074
JUST GO.
YEAH...


663
00:32:26.108 --> 00:32:28.214
BUT I'LL SEE YOU
LATER, YOU KNOW?


664
00:32:28.248 --> 00:32:30.112
I'M GONNA TAKE
A LOOK AT THAT TOO.


665
00:32:30.147 --> 00:32:31.562
IT'S NOT SAFE.

666
00:32:34.047 --> 00:32:36.049
WELL, I'LL SEE
YOU LATER, OK?


667
00:32:54.171 --> 00:32:55.310
SO WHAT DO
YOU THINK?


668
00:32:55.344 --> 00:32:57.035
THEY SEEM...
NICE.


669
00:32:57.070 --> 00:32:58.589
YEAH.

670
00:32:58.623 --> 00:33:00.418
DOES ANYONE KNOW HOW THEY
FELT ABOUT BEING CROWNED


671
00:33:00.453 --> 00:33:02.593
THE "NUDEYLAND QUEENS".

672
00:33:02.627 --> 00:33:10.394
WELL, "VERONICA" WAS PISSED,
AND "BETTY" WAS... EFFICIENT.


673
00:33:10.428 --> 00:33:12.879
YEAH, THAT'S...
THAT'S PRETTY ACCURATE.


674
00:33:28.791 --> 00:33:30.207
SHOOT!

675
00:33:30.241 --> 00:33:31.691
DID I FORGET
TO PACK IT?


676
00:33:36.213 --> 00:33:38.076
YOU WILL JUST
HAVE TO DO.


677
00:33:40.872 --> 00:33:41.839
THEY'RE NEVER
GOING TO UNDERSTAND


678
00:33:41.873 --> 00:33:43.116
THE WAY THAT
WE LIVE HERE?


679
00:33:43.151 --> 00:33:45.394
ALL WE GOTTA DO IS MAKE
THEM FEEL AT HOME.


680
00:33:45.429 --> 00:33:47.500
AND THEN MAYBE THEY'LL
BE RELAXED ENOUGH


681
00:33:47.534 --> 00:33:49.053
TO DROP
THOSE TOWELS.


682
00:33:49.087 --> 00:33:50.192
THAT'S NOT
GONNA HAPPEN.


683
00:33:50.227 --> 00:33:52.194
I SPENT ALL
AFTERNOON WITH THEM.


684
00:33:52.229 --> 00:33:53.230
OBVIOUSLY NED
HAD A REASON


685
00:33:53.264 --> 00:33:54.679
TO KEEP THIS PLACE
A SECRET FROM THEM.


686
00:33:54.714 --> 00:33:56.647
WHY DID HE
GIVE IT TO THEM?


687
00:33:56.681 --> 00:33:58.027
THEY'RE JUST
GONNA SELL IT!


688
00:33:58.062 --> 00:34:02.031
NO! HE JUST THOUGHT THAT IF THEY
CAME HERE, AND EXPERIENCED IT,


689
00:34:02.066 --> 00:34:04.033
THEY'D FALL IN LOVE WITH
BEAR LAKE LIKE WE DID.


690
00:34:04.068 --> 00:34:05.173
OH YEAH RIGHT!

691
00:34:05.207 --> 00:34:07.175
THEY WILL TURN IT
INTO CONDOS, OR A MALL,


692
00:34:07.209 --> 00:34:07.830
OR A FRIGGING
GOLF COUR--


693
00:34:07.865 --> 00:34:09.936
GUYS! GUYS!

694
00:34:09.970 --> 00:34:11.593
THOSE GIRLS HAVE
NEVER BEEN EXPOSED


695
00:34:11.627 --> 00:34:13.733
TO THIS TYPE OF
ENVIRONMENT BEFORE.


696
00:34:13.767 --> 00:34:16.218
SO OF COURSE THEY'LL
BE SCARED AT FIRST.


697
00:34:16.253 --> 00:34:18.738
I WAS.

698
00:34:18.772 --> 00:34:22.397
LOOK, IF WE TRY OUR BEST
AND HELP THEM OUT,


699
00:34:22.431 --> 00:34:23.674
THEN I'M SURE
WE CAN--


700
00:34:23.708 --> 00:34:25.020
THEY HAVE NO
OBLIGATION TO US.


701
00:34:25.054 --> 00:34:26.401
THE DON'T
EVEN LIKE US.


702
00:34:26.435 --> 00:34:31.233
THEN WE'LL JUST HAVE
TO MAKE THEM LIKE US.


703
00:34:31.268 --> 00:34:32.683
CHEERS TO THAT.

704
00:34:43.245 --> 00:34:44.591
WHAT THE FUCK
ARE YOU DOING?


705
00:34:44.626 --> 00:34:46.628
GET THAT
OUTTA THERE!


706
00:34:52.461 --> 00:34:54.049
THAT WASN'T MY
TOOTHBRUSH...


707
00:34:54.083 --> 00:34:56.362
CHARLIE! WHY WOULD
I USE YOUR TOOTHBRUSH?


708
00:34:56.396 --> 00:34:58.605
WHY WOULD YOU BE USING
A TOOTHBRUSH TO BEGIN WITH?


709
00:34:58.640 --> 00:35:00.262
'CAUSE YOU WANT
TO BE MINTY FRESH?


710
00:35:00.297 --> 00:35:02.022
NO!
I NEED TO RELAX.


711
00:35:02.057 --> 00:35:05.509
AND I LEFT MY REAL...
THING... AT HOME.


712
00:35:05.543 --> 00:35:06.268
YOU COULD'VE
BORROWED ONE OF MINE.


713
00:35:06.303 --> 00:35:07.235
I BROUGHT THREE SIZES.

714
00:35:07.269 --> 00:35:10.307
OKAY, THIS CONVERSATION
JUST ENDED.


715
00:35:10.341 --> 00:35:11.687
SO, DID YOU AT
LEAST FIND A BAR?


716
00:35:11.722 --> 00:35:13.896
NO.

717
00:35:13.931 --> 00:35:16.382
FIESTA CANTINA'S OUR
ONLY OPTION.


718
00:35:16.416 --> 00:35:18.556
NO SHIRT, NO SHOES
OR ELSE NO SERVICE.


719
00:35:18.591 --> 00:35:19.592
AWESOME.

720
00:35:26.288 --> 00:35:27.427
I'M GONNA SEE
WHAT'S ON TV.


721
00:35:27.462 --> 00:35:28.463
GOOD IDEA.

722
00:35:38.645 --> 00:35:40.578
SHIT. IS THIS
PAY-PER-VIEW?


723
00:35:40.613 --> 00:35:42.442
WELCOME TO
BEAR LAKE!


724
00:35:43.857 --> 00:35:46.308
WE HAVE A REGULATION
SIZE TENNIS COURT.


725
00:35:46.343 --> 00:35:47.344
YOU'LL LOVE IT!

726
00:35:48.759 --> 00:35:52.210
WE ALSO HAVE
HORSE SHOES...


727
00:35:55.075 --> 00:35:57.457
AND YOU CAN WORK UP A SWEAT
IN OUR OUTDOOR GYM.


728
00:36:04.050 --> 00:36:08.192
AND LATER YOU CAN RELAX THOSE
BURNING MUSCLES IN OUR HOT TUB.


729
00:36:08.226 --> 00:36:10.608
NO, I THINK IT'S SUPPOSED
TO BE "EDUCATIONAL."


730
00:36:14.060 --> 00:36:17.201
AND IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR MORE
RELAXING FUN IN THE SUN,


731
00:36:17.235 --> 00:36:20.618
BEAR LAKE BEACH IS
ONLY A SHORT HIKE AWAY.


732
00:36:22.068 --> 00:36:24.070
AND NOT ONLY DO WE HAVE
THE AMAZING FACILITIES


733
00:36:24.104 --> 00:36:25.347
THAT YOU JUST SAW,

734
00:36:25.382 --> 00:36:27.763
BUT WE SURE KNOW DO HOW
TO HAVE A GOODTIME HERE.


735
00:36:27.798 --> 00:36:29.800
WE HAVE WEEKLY
THEME PARTIES!


736
00:36:30.628 --> 00:36:32.527
ALRIGHT, I'LL SEE YOU AT
THE POOL TABLE LATER ON.


737
00:36:32.561 --> 00:36:33.493
NO MORE
OF THOSE JOKES!


738
00:36:33.528 --> 00:36:35.530
HEY! WHAT'S GOIN'
ON GIRLFRIEND!


739
00:36:35.564 --> 00:36:37.255
TWO SHOTS PLEASE!

740
00:36:37.290 --> 00:36:39.430
WE ALSO HOST
PRIVATE EVENTS...


741
00:36:39.465 --> 00:36:42.399
SUCH AS BIRTHDAYS,
BAR MITZVAHS AND WEDDINGS!


742
00:36:42.433 --> 00:36:45.436
TAKE DUSTY'S RING,
AND PUT IT ON HIS LEFT FINGER,


743
00:36:45.471 --> 00:36:47.024
AND REPEAT

744
00:36:47.058 --> 00:36:48.508
DUSTY I GIVE
YOU THIS RING.


745
00:36:48.543 --> 00:36:50.372
DUSTY, I GIVE
YOU THIS RING.


746
00:36:50.407 --> 00:36:52.063
I DIDN'T KNOW THEY
ORDAINED WOMEN PRIESTS.


747
00:36:52.098 --> 00:36:53.789
THEY DON'T.

748
00:36:53.824 --> 00:36:56.689
I ASK THAT YOU PUT THIS
ON NATALIE'S LEFT FINGER.


749
00:36:56.723 --> 00:36:58.069
SO, IS THIS
EVEN LEGAL?


750
00:36:58.104 --> 00:36:59.519
I DON'T KNOW.

751
00:36:59.554 --> 00:37:01.383
YOU MAY NOW
KISS YOUR BRIDE.


752
00:37:05.249 --> 00:37:07.665
AND THE FUN DOESN'T
STOP THERE...


753
00:37:07.700 --> 00:37:10.185
BE SURE TO CHECK OUT
CORY'S RENDITION


754
00:37:10.219 --> 00:37:12.290
OF "THE MAN-GINA
MONOLOGUES".


755
00:37:12.325 --> 00:37:13.844
"MY VAGINA IS ANGRY.

756
00:37:13.878 --> 00:37:16.225
"IT IS.
IT'S PISSED OFF.


757
00:37:16.260 --> 00:37:20.402
"MY VAGINA'S FURIOUS
AND IT NEEDS TO TALK.


758
00:37:20.437 --> 00:37:23.301
"IT NEEDS TO TALK
ABOUT ALL THIS SHIT.


759
00:37:23.336 --> 00:37:25.511
IT NEEDS TO TALK
TO YOU. "


760
00:37:25.545 --> 00:37:26.788
SO COME
TO BEAR LAKE!


761
00:37:26.822 --> 00:37:28.755
IT'S WHERE THE
BARES PLAY--


762
00:37:28.790 --> 00:37:29.791
NO, UH UH.

763
00:37:32.103 --> 00:37:33.277
WE'RE LEAVING.

764
00:37:33.311 --> 00:37:34.589
WE'RE NOT LEAVING,
CHARLIE...


765
00:37:34.623 --> 00:37:36.660
WE STILL HAVE TO GET
MY DAD'S ASHES.


766
00:37:36.694 --> 00:37:38.489
GIVE ME THE BODY.
I'LL BURN IT MYSELF.


767
00:37:38.524 --> 00:37:40.249
WHAT IS WRONG
WITH YOU?


768
00:37:40.284 --> 00:37:41.250
YOU SAW
THE VIDEO!


769
00:37:41.285 --> 00:37:42.873
THIS PLACE IS A FUCKING
NUT HOUSE!


770
00:37:42.907 --> 00:37:44.046
I KNOW.

771
00:37:44.081 --> 00:37:47.533
I JUST SAW A GROWN MAN
TALK ABOUT HIS ANGRY VAGINA...


772
00:37:47.567 --> 00:37:48.534
I GET IT!

773
00:37:48.568 --> 00:37:49.949
BUT, LET'S JUST MAKE IT
THROUGH THE WEEKEND


774
00:37:49.983 --> 00:37:52.434
AND THEN WE'LL SELL THIS PLACE
AND USE THE MONEY FOR THERAPY.


775
00:37:52.469 --> 00:37:56.300
LIKE, ETERNAL-SUNSHINE
THERAPY.


776
00:37:56.334 --> 00:37:58.095
FINE.

777
00:37:58.129 --> 00:37:59.441
LET'S JUST GO
TO BED.


778
00:37:59.476 --> 00:38:00.925
I AM SOOO DOWN
FOR THAT.


779
00:38:07.449 --> 00:38:08.761
HEY LEAH!

780
00:38:08.795 --> 00:38:10.452
YOU KNOW...

781
00:38:10.487 --> 00:38:12.903
I HAVE LIVED HERE
FOR ABOUT THREE YEARS,


782
00:38:12.937 --> 00:38:15.664
AND I GOTTA TELL YOU, THAT'S
PROBABLY THE SEXIEST OUTFIT


783
00:38:15.699 --> 00:38:18.460
I'VE SEEN SINCE
I'VE BEEN HERE.


784
00:38:18.495 --> 00:38:21.394
I'M GLAD YOU GOT
TO WITNESS IT.


785
00:38:21.429 --> 00:38:25.260
I SOOO DID NOT THINK PEOPLE
WOULD BE AWAKE THIS EARLY.


786
00:38:27.331 --> 00:38:30.748
I KNOW, I HAVE PRETTY
RIDICULOUS BEAD HEAD.


787
00:38:30.783 --> 00:38:33.475
THAT'S UH,
SOMETHING.


788
00:38:33.510 --> 00:38:34.925
IT'S HORRIBLE!

789
00:38:40.137 --> 00:38:41.759
SHE DOESN'T LIKE
MY OUTFIT, HUH?


790
00:38:41.794 --> 00:38:44.797
YEAH, IT'S THE FACT THAT
YOU'RE WEARING ONE.


791
00:38:44.831 --> 00:38:48.076
YOU KNOW WHAT, I THINK
SHE'S JUST JEALOUS.


792
00:38:48.110 --> 00:38:49.422
YEAH...
THAT'S PROBABLY IT.


793
00:38:49.457 --> 00:38:50.872
IT IS
PROBABLY IT!


794
00:38:50.906 --> 00:38:52.736
IT'S LIKE A BLANKET WITH
SLEEVES, IT'S AWESOME.


795
00:38:52.770 --> 00:38:53.771
YOU SHOULD
BUY ONE.


796
00:38:55.532 --> 00:38:57.016
I'LL HAVE
TO LOOK INTO IT...


797
00:38:57.050 --> 00:38:58.189
BUT, IN THE MEANTIME...

798
00:38:58.224 --> 00:39:00.571
WE'RE ACTUALLY GOING TO GO
GET SOME BREAKFAST.


799
00:39:00.606 --> 00:39:02.090
YOU SHOULD COME
WITH YOUR MOO MOO.


800
00:39:02.124 --> 00:39:05.749
THAT'S AN ENTICING OFFER,
BUT I HAVE A LOT OF WORK TO DO


801
00:39:05.783 --> 00:39:07.820
SO I THINK I SHOULD PROBABLY
JUST STAY HERE AND DO IT.


802
00:39:07.854 --> 00:39:09.718
WHAT KIND OF WORK
DO YOU DO?


803
00:39:09.753 --> 00:39:13.239
IT'S BORING STUFF.

804
00:39:13.273 --> 00:39:16.414
I'M A FINANCIAL
SYSTEMS ANALYST.


805
00:39:16.449 --> 00:39:19.107
IT'S THRILLING,
I KNOW.


806
00:39:19.141 --> 00:39:20.453
WOW.

807
00:39:20.488 --> 00:39:21.937
TREV',
YOU COMING?


808
00:39:21.972 --> 00:39:24.871
OKAY, WELL THAT'S
MY CUE.


809
00:39:24.906 --> 00:39:28.185
ALRIGHT.
DON'T WORK TOO HARD.


810
00:39:28.219 --> 00:39:29.048
I WON'T.

811
00:39:34.191 --> 00:39:36.055
OH, SO THAT'S
HOW IT IS.


812
00:39:36.089 --> 00:39:38.920
ALRIGHT,
BRING IT, BITCH.


813
00:40:22.411 --> 00:40:23.240
NICE.

814
00:40:25.483 --> 00:40:26.484
HI, RUSTY.

815
00:40:27.796 --> 00:40:28.797
THAT'S THE SPIRIT!

816
00:40:44.019 --> 00:40:45.158
ANOTHER DAY
LIKE THIS?


817
00:40:45.193 --> 00:40:46.159
IF I CAN.

818
00:40:46.194 --> 00:40:48.334
BUT THIS THING
KEEPS FALLING OFF.


819
00:40:51.233 --> 00:40:52.890
SO, WILL YOUR SISTER
BE JOINING US?


820
00:40:52.925 --> 00:40:54.271
I DUNNO.

821
00:40:54.305 --> 00:40:56.066
I THINK SHE IS.

822
00:40:56.100 --> 00:40:57.101
OH YEAH?
WHY?


823
00:40:57.308 --> 00:40:59.863
HEY, GUYS.
GOOD MORNING!


824
00:41:05.144 --> 00:41:07.249
GO GIRL.
WELCOME TO THE FAMILY!


825
00:41:07.284 --> 00:41:08.043
THANKS.

826
00:41:08.078 --> 00:41:09.010
DON'T YOU
JUST LOVE IT?


827
00:41:09.044 --> 00:41:09.907
MMM....

828
00:41:09.942 --> 00:41:11.426
I KNOW!
THERE AREN'T EVEN WORDS!


829
00:41:11.460 --> 00:41:12.461
COME JOIN US
FOR BREAKFAST.


830
00:41:12.496 --> 00:41:13.359
COOL, YEAH!

831
00:41:13.393 --> 00:41:14.360
GOD, YOU BITCH!

832
00:41:14.394 --> 00:41:16.569
YOU JUST COMPLETELY
ABANDONED ME.


833
00:41:16.604 --> 00:41:17.915
C'MON, CHARLIE.

834
00:41:17.950 --> 00:41:20.193
THIS IS
RIDICULOUS.


835
00:41:20.228 --> 00:41:21.850
YOU PEOPLE ARE
FUCKING INSANE.


836
00:41:21.885 --> 00:41:23.162
GOOD MORNING,
SUNSHINE!


837
00:41:23.196 --> 00:41:24.508
WHAT IS
THIS SHIT?!


838
00:41:24.542 --> 00:41:25.682
THIS GUY GETS
TO WEAR CLOTHES?


839
00:41:25.716 --> 00:41:27.269
BELIEVE ME, HONEY,
I'D RATHER NOT...


840
00:41:27.304 --> 00:41:29.996
BUT THERE'S A LOT OF JOBS AROUND
HERE THAT REQUIRE CLOTHING.


841
00:41:30.031 --> 00:41:32.240
YEAH.
LIKE, CARPENTRY...


842
00:41:32.274 --> 00:41:35.657
REMOVING BEE HIVES...

843
00:41:35.692 --> 00:41:39.040
FRYING BACON...

844
00:41:39.074 --> 00:41:40.248
AUTO REPAIR...

845
00:41:40.282 --> 00:41:42.284
DON'T TRY IT,
HONEY.


846
00:41:42.319 --> 00:41:45.736
UM... WHY DON'T YOU COME
HELP ME IN THE KITCHEN?


847
00:41:47.496 --> 00:41:49.360
HERE WE GO,

848
00:41:49.395 --> 00:41:51.259
"OVER 40
AND LOVING IT",


849
00:41:51.293 --> 00:41:54.158
IN REFERENCE TO THE NUMBER OF
SEXUAL PARTNERS YOU HAVE A DAY.


850
00:41:59.923 --> 00:42:02.442
THAT TOWEL IS REALLY
GETTING IN THE WAY.


851
00:42:02.477 --> 00:42:03.685
SORRY.

852
00:42:03.720 --> 00:42:08.897
HERE WE GO, I NOW ANOINT YOU
MY OFFICIAL KITCHEN HELPER.


853
00:42:08.932 --> 00:42:10.519
THANK YOU!

854
00:42:10.554 --> 00:42:13.937
DO YOU THINK I COULD GET
ONE FOR THE BACKSIDE?


855
00:42:13.971 --> 00:42:16.180
OK, FINE.

856
00:42:16.215 --> 00:42:20.702
BUT IF I WERE YOU,
I'D FLAUNT THAT BOOTY.


857
00:42:20.737 --> 00:42:23.740
THANK YOU, BUT I THINK
I'LL KEEP IT COVERED.


858
00:42:23.774 --> 00:42:24.775
I'M JUST SAYING!

859
00:42:24.810 --> 00:42:25.880
IF YOU'D STOP HIDING,

860
00:42:25.914 --> 00:42:28.054
YOU MAY JUST DISCOVER
NEW THINGS ABOUT YOURSELF.


861
00:42:28.089 --> 00:42:29.746
REALLY?
LIKE WHAT?


862
00:42:29.780 --> 00:42:30.919
LIKE...

863
00:42:30.954 --> 00:42:34.923
NUDISM IS AN AWESOME WAY
TO PROTEST MATERIALISM!


864
00:42:34.958 --> 00:42:36.925
I UNDERSTAND THAT,
ACTUALLY.


865
00:42:36.960 --> 00:42:38.582
I SPEND TOO MUCH
MONEY ON CLOTHES--


866
00:42:38.616 --> 00:42:39.997
TELL ME ABOUT IT.

867
00:42:40.032 --> 00:42:43.380
LAST MONTH I BOUGHT A $2,000
PAIR OF ALLIGATOR COWBOY BOOTS.


868
00:42:43.414 --> 00:42:44.588
REALLY?!

869
00:42:44.622 --> 00:42:46.072
I WANNA SEE
THOSE BOOTS!


870
00:42:46.107 --> 00:42:48.178
KRISTI CONVINCED ME
TO RETURN THEM.


871
00:42:48.212 --> 00:42:51.112
IT WAS A SAD,
SAD DAY.


872
00:42:51.146 --> 00:42:53.908
SO, YOU DO REALIZE
THERE ARE OTHER WAYS


873
00:42:53.942 --> 00:42:56.634
TO ACHIEVE SIMPLICITY
IN YOUR LIFE, RIGHT?


874
00:42:56.669 --> 00:42:58.636
LIKE, YOU DON'T HAVE TO
STRIP OFF ALL YOUR CLOTHES


875
00:42:58.671 --> 00:43:00.569
JUST TO PROTEST
MATERIALISM.


876
00:43:00.604 --> 00:43:01.709
OF COURSE,
I KNOW THAT.


877
00:43:01.743 --> 00:43:03.296
THAT'S NOT WHY
I LIVE HERE.


878
00:43:03.331 --> 00:43:05.574
WHY DO YOU
LIVE HERE?


879
00:43:05.609 --> 00:43:09.061
WELL, I GREW UP IN
SOUTHERN INDIANA.


880
00:43:09.095 --> 00:43:11.719
AND GROWING UP GAY IN SOUTHERN
INDIANA WAS A NIGHTMARE.


881
00:43:11.753 --> 00:43:13.755
EVERY FUCKING DAY OF MY
LIFE SOME JOCK WAS LIKE,


882
00:43:13.790 --> 00:43:15.101
"HEY, SUCK
MY COCK,"


883
00:43:15.136 --> 00:43:17.448
AND THE NEXT DAY AT SCHOOL,
HE WOULD KICK MY TEETH IN.


884
00:43:17.483 --> 00:43:20.831
I DID TWO DAYS AT IU, AND
THE SAME SHIT WENT DOWN...


885
00:43:20.866 --> 00:43:23.006
SO I JUST GOT
IN MY CAR


886
00:43:23.040 --> 00:43:24.732
AND DROVE STRAIGHT
TO WEST HOLLYWOOD.


887
00:43:24.766 --> 00:43:29.219
BUT LA SUCKED TOO...
FOR DIFFERENT REASONS.


888
00:43:29.253 --> 00:43:31.359
WHY?

889
00:43:31.393 --> 00:43:35.846
THE MATERIALISM, THE ELITISM,
THE EXPENSE OF JUST GETTING BY.


890
00:43:35.881 --> 00:43:38.953
SO, THE GUY I WAS DATING
BROUGHT ME TO BEAR LAKE!


891
00:43:38.987 --> 00:43:41.024
AND, HERE I AM!

892
00:43:41.058 --> 00:43:43.026
HE'S SOOO LONG GONE,

893
00:43:43.060 --> 00:43:46.754
BUT THIS IS THE HAPPIEST
I'VE EVER BEEN.


894
00:43:46.788 --> 00:43:49.618
GOOD FOR YOU,
I GUESS.


895
00:43:49.653 --> 00:43:51.448
YOU SHOULD TRY IT.

896
00:43:51.482 --> 00:43:52.898
THIS PLACE-

897
00:43:52.932 --> 00:43:55.383
WHERE WHO YOU ARE AS A HUMAN
BEING IS ALL THAT MATTERS -


898
00:43:55.417 --> 00:43:56.694
AND WHAT OTHER
PEOPLE THINK OF YOU


899
00:43:56.729 --> 00:43:58.386
DOESN'T MATTER
A DARN THING.


900
00:43:58.420 --> 00:43:59.697
WELL, I DIG THAT.

901
00:43:59.732 --> 00:44:01.009
I DON'T CARE WHAT
PEOPLE THINK OF ME.


902
00:44:01.044 --> 00:44:02.700
YOU ARE
SOO LYING!


903
00:44:02.735 --> 00:44:03.736
IF THAT WERE TRUE,

904
00:44:03.771 --> 00:44:06.912
YOU WOULDN'T BE SPORTING
THE DOUBLE-APRON LOOK.


905
00:44:06.946 --> 00:44:09.949
SO...

906
00:44:09.984 --> 00:44:12.055
DO YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE
GONNA DO WITH THE PLACE?


907
00:44:12.089 --> 00:44:16.473
YOU'RE NOT GONNA LIKE SELL
IT TO DEVELOPERS, ARE YOU?


908
00:44:16.507 --> 00:44:19.545
TO BE HONEST, I COULD
REALLY USE THE CASH.


909
00:44:19.579 --> 00:44:21.892
NOOOOOOOO.
PLEASE DON'T DO THAT.


910
00:44:21.927 --> 00:44:24.239
I DON'T KNOW WHERE
I WOULD GO.


911
00:44:24.274 --> 00:44:26.759
WELL NOTHING HAS
BEEN DECIDED YET.


912
00:44:26.794 --> 00:44:28.381
WE JUST TALKED
ABOUT IT THIS MORNING...


913
00:44:28.416 --> 00:44:30.383
AND THEN LEAH GOT
A CALL FROM SOME GUY,


914
00:44:30.418 --> 00:44:32.075
AND SHE WAS ON THE PHONE
FOR A COUPLE HOURS.


915
00:44:32.109 --> 00:44:32.869
OOH!
A GUY?!?!


916
00:44:32.903 --> 00:44:34.525
WHAT GUY?

917
00:44:34.560 --> 00:44:37.425
UM, FROM THE

918
00:44:37.459 --> 00:44:40.566
SWEETIE... WE'RE ALL
FROM THE 21ST CENTURY...


919
00:44:40.600 --> 00:44:44.259
YOU MEAN A GUY
FROM CENTURY 21.


920
00:44:44.294 --> 00:44:45.191
THE REALTY COMPANY?

921
00:44:45.226 --> 00:44:47.021
THAT'S THE ONE, YEAH!

922
00:44:47.055 --> 00:44:51.266
WE PUT OUT A COUPLE
FEELERS TO A FEW BUYERS.


923
00:44:51.301 --> 00:44:54.718
BUT, WITH MY LUCK, NO
ONE WILL BE INTERESTED.


924
00:44:54.752 --> 00:44:57.307
I'LL BE HONEST
WITH YA -


925
00:44:57.341 --> 00:45:02.553
AS SOMEONE WHO'S HAD NEARLY
FOUR DECADES OF BAD LUCK -


926
00:45:02.588 --> 00:45:06.419
THIS PLACE IS THE ONLY
'GOOD LUCK' I'VE EVER HAD.


927
00:45:07.904 --> 00:45:09.837
I LOVE YOU TOO.
BYE.


928
00:45:11.977 --> 00:45:13.012
WHAT'S WITH
THE CLOTHES?


929
00:45:13.047 --> 00:45:14.600
THE NUDISM
DIDN'T TAKE?


930
00:45:14.634 --> 00:45:15.912
NO SO MUCH.

931
00:45:15.946 --> 00:45:18.086
WHAT'S ALL THIS?

932
00:45:18.121 --> 00:45:21.020
CORY LET ME OUT OF THE
KITCHEN FOR JUST A FEW HOURS


933
00:45:21.055 --> 00:45:23.712
TO HELP YOU CLEAN THE
CABIN SO... LET'S GO.


934
00:45:23.747 --> 00:45:25.059
YOU READY?

935
00:45:25.093 --> 00:45:25.922
YEAH.

936
00:45:44.457 --> 00:45:45.873
HE HAS
ROMANCE NOVELS.


937
00:45:51.085 --> 00:45:52.120
THEY CAN'T
BE HIS...


938
00:45:52.155 --> 00:45:53.363
THERE'S LIKE TEN
OF THEM HERE!


939
00:45:53.397 --> 00:45:56.780
NO THAT...
DOESN'T FIT.


940
00:45:56.814 --> 00:46:00.266
THERE IS SO MUCH I DIDN'T
KNOW ABOUT HIM.


941
00:46:00.301 --> 00:46:03.200
OH, C'MON, YOU KNEW
LIKE EVERYTHING ABOUT HIM.


942
00:46:03.235 --> 00:46:05.893
EXCEPT FOR A FEW
CHOICE HOBBIES.


943
00:46:05.927 --> 00:46:08.309
WOAH...

944
00:46:08.343 --> 00:46:10.173
I FOUND A
PHOTO ALBUM.


945
00:46:12.278 --> 00:46:15.799
THIS IS WHEN HE TOOK ME TO GREAT
AMERICA WHEN I WAS LIKE, 12.


946
00:46:15.833 --> 00:46:18.077
HE REFUSED TO RIDE ANY
OF THE ROLLER COASTERS


947
00:46:18.112 --> 00:46:20.424
'CAUSE HE GO, LIKE,
NAUSEOUS.


948
00:46:20.459 --> 00:46:23.289
IT'S SO WEIRD...

949
00:46:23.324 --> 00:46:26.154
IT'S SO CRAZY
TO SEE HIM.


950
00:46:27.431 --> 00:46:28.639
UGH!

951
00:46:28.674 --> 00:46:33.058
OH MY GOD! OH JESUS!
NAKED FATHER PICTURES!


952
00:46:33.092 --> 00:46:35.439
UGH, EWWW!

953
00:46:35.474 --> 00:46:39.133
THAT'S DISGUSTING.
THAT'S DISGUSTING!


954
00:46:39.167 --> 00:46:41.411
THAT IS SO WRONG
THAT I EVEN SAW THAT.


955
00:46:41.445 --> 00:46:42.860
THAT JUST HAPPENED!

956
00:46:47.072 --> 00:46:48.936
CLEARLY, HE DIDN'T
NEED THESE!


957
00:46:51.386 --> 00:46:55.114
WHY AM I LAUGHING
ABOUT THIS?


958
00:46:55.149 --> 00:46:56.598
OH MY GOSH.

959
00:47:02.777 --> 00:47:04.779
THIS STUFF EVEN
SMELLS LIKE HIM.


960
00:47:04.813 --> 00:47:06.298
I JUST FOUND
HIS JOURNAL.


961
00:47:06.332 --> 00:47:08.645
NO!

962
00:47:08.679 --> 00:47:11.303
HE DID NOT HAVE
A JOURNAL...


963
00:47:11.337 --> 00:47:14.582
HE USED TO GIVE ME SO MUCH
CRAP FOR HAVING A JOURNAL!


964
00:47:14.616 --> 00:47:16.653
DO YOU THINK WE
CAN READ IT?


965
00:47:16.687 --> 00:47:18.931
HE'S NOT
GONNA KNOW.


966
00:47:18.966 --> 00:47:20.898
YOU KNOW WHAT
WE SHOULD DO?


967
00:47:20.933 --> 00:47:22.624
WE SHOULD HAVE
A KEEP PILE,


968
00:47:22.659 --> 00:47:23.901
SO WE CAN KEEP
THE IMPORTANT STUFF


969
00:47:23.936 --> 00:47:26.939
AND THEN BOX THE REST UP
OR THROW IT AWAY.


970
00:47:30.322 --> 00:47:30.978
OH MY GOD!

971
00:47:31.012 --> 00:47:31.702
WHAT JUST HAPPENED?

972
00:47:31.737 --> 00:47:32.738
OH MY GOD!

973
00:47:32.772 --> 00:47:33.773
WHAT?! WHAT?!

974
00:47:35.499 --> 00:47:38.640
OH MY GOD, YOUR DAD
WAS A SLUT TOO!


975
00:47:38.675 --> 00:47:39.607
NO HE WASN'T!

976
00:47:39.641 --> 00:47:41.298
THAT WAS NOT HIS.

977
00:47:41.333 --> 00:47:44.094
YOU DON'T
THINK IT WAS--


978
00:47:44.129 --> 00:47:46.303
HE'S NOT GAY
CHARLIE!


979
00:47:46.338 --> 00:47:48.616
OOO HEY!
I HAVE AN IDEA!


980
00:47:48.650 --> 00:47:50.652
LET'S USE YOUR DEAD
DAD'S NUDIE PICTURES


981
00:47:50.687 --> 00:47:53.310
TO PICK UP HIS
DIRTY CONDOM.


982
00:47:53.345 --> 00:47:55.485
DID YOU REALLY
JUST SAY THAT?


983
00:47:55.519 --> 00:47:58.833
YOU'RE SO AWKWARD...
OH, MY GOSH.


984
00:47:58.867 --> 00:48:00.317
YOU KNOW WHAT?

985
00:48:00.352 --> 00:48:02.768
I THINK WE SHOULD JUST BURN
THE WHOLE CABIN DOWN?


986
00:48:02.802 --> 00:48:04.252
IT'LL BE FASTER.

987
00:48:04.287 --> 00:48:05.736
YOU DON'T HAVE
TO STAY.


988
00:48:05.771 --> 00:48:07.048
YOU CAN GO
IF YOU WANT.


989
00:48:07.083 --> 00:48:09.257
I MEAN, I'M TOTALLY FINE LOOKING
THROUGH THIS STUFF BY MYSELF.


990
00:48:09.292 --> 00:48:11.673
I'LL GO ASK KRISTI
FOR A FEW BOXES.


991
00:48:11.708 --> 00:48:12.536
COOL.

992
00:48:13.951 --> 00:48:15.263
I'M GONNA SNAG
THESE TWO.


993
00:48:15.298 --> 00:48:16.299
GO FOR IT.

994
00:48:21.476 --> 00:48:22.236
YOU GOT IT?

995
00:48:22.270 --> 00:48:23.099
YEAH.

996
00:48:24.721 --> 00:48:25.549
FUCK!

997
00:48:29.795 --> 00:48:30.692
YOU NEED
ANY HELP?


998
00:48:30.727 --> 00:48:33.385
I'M SO HUNGRY,
I JUST WANNA GO EAT.


999
00:48:33.419 --> 00:48:36.698
YEAH, BUT I THOUGHT
IT CLOSED AT 6?


1000
00:48:36.733 --> 00:48:39.805
I'VE GOT THE
KITCHEN COVERED.


1001
00:48:39.839 --> 00:48:41.669
COME ON. IT'S FINE,
WE'LL DO IT LATER.


1002
00:48:44.879 --> 00:48:46.881
LET'S JUST TAKE THIS
ONE TO THE CAR. LETS GO.


1003
00:48:57.202 --> 00:48:58.375
THEY KEEP PLATES
OF FOOD IN THE OVEN


1004
00:48:58.410 --> 00:49:01.033
FOR PEOPLE WHO
MISS MEALS.


1005
00:49:01.068 --> 00:49:02.034
SWEET!

1006
00:49:02.069 --> 00:49:03.104
AW, FUCKTWAT!

1007
00:49:03.139 --> 00:49:03.932
YOU OK?

1008
00:49:03.967 --> 00:49:05.624
IS EVERYONE
OK IN HERE?


1009
00:49:05.658 --> 00:49:06.901
WHERE DID YOU
LEARN TO SPEAK?


1010
00:49:06.935 --> 00:49:09.076
OH.
IT'S YOU TWO.


1011
00:49:09.110 --> 00:49:11.285
HELLO, LAUREN.

1012
00:49:11.319 --> 00:49:14.736
HI...
HEY! WAIT...


1013
00:49:14.771 --> 00:49:17.187
I KNOW YOU GUYS HAVEN'T BEEN
HAVING THE GREATEST TIME HERE--


1014
00:49:17.222 --> 00:49:19.810
THIS IS GOING TO BE
THE WORST BLISTER EVER.


1015
00:49:19.845 --> 00:49:23.538
BUT WE'RE HAVING A PARTY
TONIGHT AT THE BAR.


1016
00:49:23.573 --> 00:49:25.402
YOU SHOULD REALLY
THINK ABOUT COMING.


1017
00:49:25.437 --> 00:49:27.335
GREAT, THANKS
FOR THE INVITE.


1018
00:49:27.370 --> 00:49:29.061
NO, SERIOUSLY.
CONSIDER IT.


1019
00:49:29.096 --> 00:49:32.099
IT'S A THEME PARTY, AND
THE THEME IS 'ONE ITEM'.


1020
00:49:32.133 --> 00:49:34.273
SO, YOU CAN WEAR
WHATEVER YOU WANT,


1021
00:49:34.308 --> 00:49:36.275
AS LONG AS IT'S JUST
ONE THING.


1022
00:49:36.310 --> 00:49:37.759
THAT SOUNDS...
PROMISING.


1023
00:49:37.794 --> 00:49:39.554
YEAH, RIGHT?

1024
00:49:39.589 --> 00:49:42.695
WILL THERE BE LIKE,
AN OPEN BAR?


1025
00:49:42.730 --> 00:49:44.559
TREVOR'S USUALLY
PRETTY GENEROUS.


1026
00:49:45.836 --> 00:49:47.942
COOL, I'LL GO.

1027
00:49:47.976 --> 00:49:49.702
REALLY?

1028
00:49:49.737 --> 00:49:50.979
YEAH, REALLY?

1029
00:49:51.014 --> 00:49:52.153
WHY NOT?

1030
00:49:52.188 --> 00:49:54.604
I MEAN, I COULD USE SOMETHING
TO TAKE THE EDGE OFF.


1031
00:49:54.638 --> 00:49:56.364
BUT YOU SURE HAVE
A FASCINATING WAY


1032
00:49:56.399 --> 00:49:58.125
OF UNWINDING AT THE END
OF A LONG, HARD DAY--


1033
00:49:58.159 --> 00:50:00.023
DROP IT ALREADY!

1034
00:50:00.057 --> 00:50:01.507
AND, WHAT ABOUT
YOU CHARLIE?


1035
00:50:01.542 --> 00:50:03.233
WE'LL SEE.

1036
00:50:03.268 --> 00:50:04.786
GREAT!

1037
00:50:04.821 --> 00:50:06.547
AND FOR THE RECORD,

1038
00:50:06.581 --> 00:50:09.964
I WON'T TELL KRISTI
ABOUT YOUR TEXTILES.


1039
00:50:09.998 --> 00:50:11.931
THANKS.

1040
00:50:11.966 --> 00:50:15.107
BUT YOU SHOULD THINK
ABOUT TRYING SOMETHING NEW.


1041
00:50:15.142 --> 00:50:16.108
CAN'T HURT,
RIGHT?


1042
00:50:16.143 --> 00:50:18.179
YES, IT CAN.

1043
00:50:18.214 --> 00:50:20.871
I'VE TOTALLY GOT THE
RUG BURNS TO PROVE IT.


1044
00:50:20.906 --> 00:50:22.942
CHARMING.

1045
00:50:22.977 --> 00:50:24.806
WHATEVER, HAVE FUN
AT YOUR LITTLE PARTY.


1046
00:50:26.843 --> 00:50:30.743
AH, YOU'RE BAD!
T-REX RULE APPLIES.


1047
00:50:30.778 --> 00:50:32.952
YOU LOOK LIKE
A BUNNY!


1048
00:50:32.987 --> 00:50:35.955
LOOK WHO'S
AT THE PARTY.


1049
00:50:35.990 --> 00:50:37.578
I TOLD YOU THEY'D
COME AROUND!


1050
00:50:37.612 --> 00:50:41.616
YEAH BUT DRUNK NUDISTS
ARE SCARY TO UPTIGHT PRUDES.


1051
00:50:41.651 --> 00:50:44.447
I THINK YOU UNDERESTIMATE
MY CHARM. YOOHOO!


1052
00:50:44.481 --> 00:50:45.689
HI!

1053
00:50:45.724 --> 00:50:47.588
HEY...

1054
00:50:47.622 --> 00:50:48.347
A SHEET?

1055
00:50:48.382 --> 00:50:50.211
REALLY?
THAT'S ALL YOU GOT?


1056
00:50:50.591 --> 00:50:52.075
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOUR
NEW FOUND FREEDOM?


1057
00:50:52.109 --> 00:50:54.457
IT WAS A LITTLE
TOO FREE-ING.


1058
00:50:54.491 --> 00:50:56.700
AH. COME JOIN US!
COME ON.


1059
00:50:56.735 --> 00:50:57.977
THANKS.

1060
00:50:58.012 --> 00:50:59.600
HEY LEAH!
YOU WANT A DRINK?


1061
00:50:59.634 --> 00:51:02.154
YEAH! THAT'S WHAT
I'M HERE FOR.


1062
00:51:02.189 --> 00:51:03.431
I LIKE YOUR ITEM!

1063
00:51:03.466 --> 00:51:04.605
THANK YOU!

1064
00:51:04.639 --> 00:51:06.158
CAN I GET YOU
A DRINK?


1065
00:51:06.193 --> 00:51:08.229
SURE, BUT I HAVE
TO WARN YOU.


1066
00:51:08.264 --> 00:51:10.127
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO
GET ME PRETTY DRUNK


1067
00:51:10.162 --> 00:51:12.095
IT YOU EXPECT TO
SLEEP WITH ME.


1068
00:51:12.129 --> 00:51:14.062
AND YOU'D HAVE TO GET ME DRUNK
ENOUGH TO FORGET I LIKE COCK,


1069
00:51:14.097 --> 00:51:15.236
SO I THINK
WE'RE GOOD.


1070
00:51:15.271 --> 00:51:16.203
WHAT'LL IT BE?

1071
00:51:16.237 --> 00:51:17.031
LONG ISLAND.

1072
00:51:17.065 --> 00:51:18.239
ONE LONG ISLAND,
COMING UP!


1073
00:51:18.274 --> 00:51:19.240
THIS ROUND'S
ON ME.


1074
00:51:20.068 --> 00:51:24.383
HEY TREV, DO YOU THINK
YOU COULD TAKE FIVE,


1075
00:51:24.418 --> 00:51:26.247
COME DANCE
WITH ME?


1076
00:51:26.282 --> 00:51:28.111
OH, SORRY LAUREN.

1077
00:51:30.286 --> 00:51:32.736
WHATEVER.
IT'S YOUR LOSS.


1078
00:51:32.771 --> 00:51:34.428
NOT REALLY.

1079
00:51:34.462 --> 00:51:36.706
SO I HAVE A QUESTION
FOR YOU.


1080
00:51:36.740 --> 00:51:39.433
YOU'RE ALL PUNK ROCK
AND NONCONFORMIST...


1081
00:51:39.467 --> 00:51:40.882
YES?

1082
00:51:40.917 --> 00:51:41.918
SO WHAT'S MORE
ANTI-ESTABLISHMENT


1083
00:51:41.952 --> 00:51:43.575
THAN WHAT
WE DO HERE?


1084
00:51:43.609 --> 00:51:46.233
KRISTI! DRINK?

1085
00:51:46.267 --> 00:51:48.718
THE USUAL.

1086
00:51:48.752 --> 00:51:50.582
THAT'S A
VALID POINT...


1087
00:51:53.930 --> 00:51:56.967
SO, YOU'RE BACK TO BREAKING
THE DRESS CODE?


1088
00:51:57.002 --> 00:52:00.074
OH COME ON!
DON'T EVEN!


1089
00:52:00.108 --> 00:52:00.971
WHAT?

1090
00:52:01.006 --> 00:52:02.525
I TOTALLY FOLLOWED
THE RULES.


1091
00:52:02.559 --> 00:52:03.871
THEY SAID
'ONE ITEM'.


1092
00:52:03.905 --> 00:52:04.872
ONE ITEM!

1093
00:52:04.906 --> 00:52:07.288
WEAK.
SAUCE.


1094
00:52:07.323 --> 00:52:09.773
I DIDN'T EVEN
WEAR UNDERWEAR.


1095
00:52:09.808 --> 00:52:11.603
WELL, THAT'S
A START.


1096
00:52:11.637 --> 00:52:12.466
IT IS!

1097
00:52:43.428 --> 00:52:45.050
THAT TASTES
FUCKING GOOD.


1098
00:52:45.084 --> 00:52:47.052
COME ONE,
LET'S DANCE.


1099
00:52:47.086 --> 00:52:48.433
UH, NO.

1100
00:52:48.467 --> 00:52:51.159
I USUALLY WAIT UNTIL THE
SECOND OR THIRD DATE


1101
00:52:51.194 --> 00:52:53.714
TO LET PEOPLE RUB
THEIR JUNK ON MY ASS.


1102
00:52:53.748 --> 00:52:55.578
SO, HERE, HERE...

1103
00:52:55.612 --> 00:53:00.790
AND... WHAT DATE WOULD
YOU CONSIDER THIS?


1104
00:53:00.824 --> 00:53:03.827
WELL, WHAT DATE WOULD
YOU WANT IT TO BE?


1105
00:53:09.626 --> 00:53:10.627
I LIKE YOU!

1106
00:53:12.595 --> 00:53:14.976
DUDE, I TOTALLY JUST
BUSTED MY KNEE!


1107
00:53:15.011 --> 00:53:16.253
CAN WE SIT?

1108
00:53:16.288 --> 00:53:17.462
SIT DOWN,
SIT DOWN.


1109
00:53:17.496 --> 00:53:18.877
YOU CAN HAVE YOUR
TOP HAT BACK NOW!


1110
00:53:18.911 --> 00:53:19.981
SHHH.

1111
00:53:20.016 --> 00:53:22.605
I KNOW.
SHHHH!


1112
00:53:22.639 --> 00:53:23.709
CLOSE ENOUGH.

1113
00:53:23.744 --> 00:53:25.366
YOU ARE
SO ADORABLE.


1114
00:53:25.401 --> 00:53:27.575
YEAH?
WELL, YOU'RE SWEET.


1115
00:53:27.610 --> 00:53:29.059
WELL, YOU'RE HOT.

1116
00:53:29.094 --> 00:53:31.096
IS THAT SO?

1117
00:53:31.130 --> 00:53:33.823
UH HUH.
LIKE, CRAZY HOT.


1118
00:53:33.857 --> 00:53:36.135
LIKE THE KIND OF HOT WHEN YOU
TAKE PIZZA OUT OF THE OVEN


1119
00:53:36.170 --> 00:53:37.999
AND IT BURNS YOU--

1120
00:53:45.179 --> 00:53:46.767
YOU TASTE GOOD.

1121
00:53:46.801 --> 00:53:49.114
WELL YOU
SMELL GOOD.


1122
00:53:49.148 --> 00:53:50.736
YOU KNOW WHAT I WAS
THINKING EARLIER?


1123
00:53:50.771 --> 00:53:51.875
WHAT'S THAT?

1124
00:53:51.910 --> 00:53:55.051
THAT IF I COULD
FUCK A SMELL,


1125
00:53:55.085 --> 00:53:58.054
I WOULD SOO FUCK
YOUR SMELL.


1126
00:53:58.088 --> 00:54:00.159
LEAH,
ARE YOU OK?


1127
00:54:00.194 --> 00:54:02.023
I WOULD SOO FUCK
YOUR SMELL.


1128
00:54:14.311 --> 00:54:15.554
IS THIS
YOUR PLACE?


1129
00:54:15.589 --> 00:54:16.728
UH HUH.

1130
00:54:16.762 --> 00:54:17.763
WELL LET'S
GO THEN!


1131
00:54:19.040 --> 00:54:20.870
NOT MUCH LEFT...

1132
00:54:25.461 --> 00:54:27.911
YOU KNOW WHAT
I DON'T GET?


1133
00:54:27.946 --> 00:54:30.914
WHY WOULD MY
DAD HAVE A BABY


1134
00:54:30.949 --> 00:54:36.920
AND THEN LEAVE HER FOR
ANOTHER BABY? RIGHT?


1135
00:54:36.955 --> 00:54:40.096
HE CHEATED ON ME
WITH A DIFFERENT BABY!


1136
00:54:40.130 --> 00:54:41.891
THAT'S WHAT'S
HE DID.


1137
00:54:41.925 --> 00:54:43.237
THAT'S EXACTLY
WHAT HE DID.


1138
00:54:43.271 --> 00:54:44.411
THAT'S MY CUE!

1139
00:54:44.445 --> 00:54:47.448
GOOD NIGHT TO YOU,
AND GOOD LUCK TO YOU!


1140
00:54:47.483 --> 00:54:49.243
I THINK WE NEED TO GET
YOU ON TO THE WATER.


1141
00:54:49.277 --> 00:54:52.177
OK, YEAH, TOP IT OFF
FOR ME, THANK YOU.


1142
00:54:52.211 --> 00:54:53.903
YOU DON'T
WEAR CLOTHES!


1143
00:54:53.937 --> 00:54:55.491
WHAT DO YOU DO
WITH YOUR KEYS?


1144
00:54:55.525 --> 00:54:57.113
I LEAVE THEM UNDER
THE DOORSTEP.


1145
00:54:57.147 --> 00:55:00.910
WELL I'M GONNA SIT HERE
TILL YOU FIND THEM.


1146
00:55:00.944 --> 00:55:01.911
TREVOR?

1147
00:55:01.945 --> 00:55:03.153
YEAH?

1148
00:55:03.188 --> 00:55:05.466
I HAVE A SECRET.

1149
00:55:05.501 --> 00:55:08.538
AND WHAT'S
THAT SECRET?


1150
00:55:08.573 --> 00:55:11.161
I TOTALLY WORE MORE
THAN ONE ITEM.


1151
00:55:11.196 --> 00:55:14.268
NOT FOR LONG.

1152
00:55:14.302 --> 00:55:16.995
YOU KNOW
ANOTHER THING?


1153
00:55:17.029 --> 00:55:21.482
I BET SHE HAD THE
BEST CHRISTMASES EVER.


1154
00:55:21.517 --> 00:55:22.552
YOU KNOW?

1155
00:55:22.587 --> 00:55:24.243
LIKE SHE HAD
PRESENTS UNDER HER TREE.


1156
00:55:24.278 --> 00:55:26.418
AND I BET SHE DID NOT
SPEND HER CHILDHOOD


1157
00:55:26.453 --> 00:55:29.248
WONDERING WHY HER
DADDY DIDN'T WANT HER.


1158
00:55:29.283 --> 00:55:31.975
WHY DON'T WE
GET YOU TO BED?


1159
00:55:32.010 --> 00:55:35.807
YOU'RE SO NICE.
I LOVE YOU, CORY.


1160
00:55:35.841 --> 00:55:38.568
LOVE YOU TOO, BUT I'M NOT
GONNA SLEEP WITH YOU.


1161
00:55:38.603 --> 00:55:40.467
THAT'S YOUR LOSS,
ISN'T IT?


1162
00:55:53.272 --> 00:55:56.483
THIS IS SO CRAZY BECAUSE I
TOTALLY DID NOT EVEN THINK


1163
00:55:56.517 --> 00:55:58.001
THAT YOU LIKED ME.

1164
00:55:58.036 --> 00:56:00.901
WHAT? WHY?

1165
00:56:00.935 --> 00:56:03.973
BECAUSE I THOUGHT
THAT YOU LIKED...


1166
00:56:04.007 --> 00:56:07.148
ANNIE, CURLY ANNIE...

1167
00:56:07.183 --> 00:56:08.978
YOU MEAN LAUREN,
DON'T YOU?


1168
00:56:09.012 --> 00:56:12.153
I-- BUT SHE TOTALLY LOOKS
LIKE LITTLE ORPHAN ANNIE,


1169
00:56:12.188 --> 00:56:13.120
DOESN'T SHE?

1170
00:56:13.154 --> 00:56:14.293
I KNOW!

1171
00:56:14.328 --> 00:56:16.157
I FUCKIN' LOVE
THAT MOVIE!


1172
00:56:18.505 --> 00:56:22.716
HEY...HEY,
WHAT'S WRONG?


1173
00:56:22.750 --> 00:56:25.063
NOTHING.
IT'S OK.


1174
00:56:25.097 --> 00:56:29.999
LOOK, LAUREN AND I NEVER
HAD ANYTHING GOING ON, OK?


1175
00:56:30.033 --> 00:56:31.518
LIAR!

1176
00:56:31.552 --> 00:56:32.726
YOU ARE SUCH
A LIAR.


1177
00:56:32.760 --> 00:56:35.487
I TOTALLY WOULDN'T
BLAME YOU.


1178
00:56:35.522 --> 00:56:37.972
SHE'S A NAKED
FUCKIN' YOGA INSTRUCTOR!


1179
00:56:38.007 --> 00:56:40.319
SHE'S, LIKE,
FLEXIBLE!


1180
00:56:40.354 --> 00:56:41.458
LEAH, I WAS
NEVER INTO HER.


1181
00:56:41.493 --> 00:56:43.737
BESIDES, SHE WAS
SLEEPING WITH NED--


1182
00:56:43.771 --> 00:56:46.222
WHAT?

1183
00:56:46.256 --> 00:56:47.326
WHAT?

1184
00:56:47.361 --> 00:56:49.190
HE'S MARRIED!

1185
00:56:51.607 --> 00:56:52.573
ARE YOU SERIOUS?

1186
00:56:56.922 --> 00:56:59.580
AND YOU DIDN'T
STOP IT?


1187
00:56:59.615 --> 00:57:02.618
IT'S NOT LIKE I CAN
CONTROL ANYONE HERE.


1188
00:57:02.652 --> 00:57:04.689
THAT'S ALL YOU'VE DONE
SINCE WE GOT HERE,


1189
00:57:04.723 --> 00:57:05.931
IS TRY TO CONTROL US!

1190
00:57:05.966 --> 00:57:07.830
NO, WE ARE NOT TRYING TO
CONTROL YOU GUYS, LEAH.


1191
00:57:07.864 --> 00:57:10.246
THIS IS
OUR LIFESTYLE.


1192
00:57:10.280 --> 00:57:13.594
I AM SO FUCKING DONE
WITH YOU GUYS.


1193
00:57:13.629 --> 00:57:14.284
LEAH, WAIT.

1194
00:57:14.319 --> 00:57:16.217
YOU'RE SUCH
A HYPOCRITE.


1195
00:57:16.252 --> 00:57:18.081
AND YOUR KEYS ARE
IN THE DOOR, IDIOT!


1196
00:57:22.845 --> 00:57:23.673
OW!!

1197
00:57:42.105 --> 00:57:43.935
YOU'RE JUST AS DRUNK
AS I WAS.


1198
00:58:00.020 --> 00:58:02.091
WHERE ARE
YOU GOING?


1199
00:58:02.125 --> 00:58:04.749
KRISTI KICKED ME OUT
OF THE KITCHEN,


1200
00:58:04.783 --> 00:58:08.304
SO I HAVE TO GO FIND
FOR ANOTHER CLOTHED JOB.


1201
00:58:08.338 --> 00:58:13.896
SOUNDS LIKE MY ONLY TWO OPTIONS
ARE CARPENTRY AND BEE KEEPING.


1202
00:58:13.930 --> 00:58:16.761
CHARLIE, WE OWN
THIS PLACE NOW.


1203
00:58:16.795 --> 00:58:17.969
WE CAN MAKE
THE RULES.


1204
00:58:18.003 --> 00:58:21.800
YOU DON'T HAVE TO HAVE A JOB
IN ORDER TO WEAR CLOTHES.


1205
00:58:31.085 --> 00:58:32.328
HI, KRISTI.

1206
00:58:32.362 --> 00:58:33.260
HEY, LEAH.

1207
00:58:33.294 --> 00:58:34.606
DO YOU HAVE SOME
TAPE I CAN BORROW?


1208
00:58:34.641 --> 00:58:35.987
SURE.

1209
00:58:36.021 --> 00:58:38.092
THANK YOU
VERY MUCH.


1210
00:58:38.127 --> 00:58:39.300
WHAT HAVE YOU
GOT THERE?


1211
00:58:39.335 --> 00:58:41.302
OH, JUST SOME NEW
RESORT RULES.


1212
00:58:41.337 --> 00:58:42.165
WHAT?

1213
00:58:45.893 --> 00:58:47.136
YOU CAN'T
DO THIS.


1214
00:58:47.170 --> 00:58:48.240
ACTUALLY, I CAN.

1215
00:58:48.275 --> 00:58:50.104
SEE, I NOW OWN HALF
OF BEAR LAKE,


1216
00:58:50.139 --> 00:58:52.279
WHICH MEANS I CAN MAKE
WHATEVER CHANGES I SEE FIT.


1217
00:58:52.313 --> 00:58:54.212
I'M SORRY.

1218
00:58:54.246 --> 00:58:56.248
I'M GONNA BORROW
THIS REAL QUICK.


1219
00:58:57.180 --> 00:58:59.389
ATTENTION ALL
BEAR LAKE GUESTS!


1220
00:58:59.424 --> 00:59:00.494
PLEASE LISTEN CAREFULLY

1221
00:59:00.528 --> 00:59:02.979
AS WE ARE ESTABLISHING
A NEW SET OF RESORT RULES.


1222
00:59:03.014 --> 00:59:06.258
BEAR LAKE IS
NOW A CLOTHING OPTIONAL RESORT.


1223
00:59:06.293 --> 00:59:08.088
YOU MAY WEAR CLOTHING
IF YOU PREFER.


1224
00:59:08.122 --> 00:59:08.951
SWEET.

1225
00:59:11.643 --> 00:59:12.817
THANK GOD!

1226
00:59:12.851 --> 00:59:13.714
YOU CAN'T TAKE--!

1227
00:59:13.749 --> 00:59:14.750
SURE CAN!

1228
00:59:14.784 --> 00:59:16.959
THIS ONE'S IMPORTANT,

1229
00:59:16.993 --> 00:59:18.477
NO ADULTERY.

1230
00:59:18.512 --> 00:59:19.720
AND RULE NUMBER THREE,

1231
00:59:19.755 --> 00:59:21.584
WHICH IS KIND OF MY
PERSONAL FAVORITE.


1232
00:59:21.618 --> 00:59:23.897
IT ALSO GOES HAND IN HAND

1233
00:59:23.931 --> 00:59:25.622
NO SKANKS ALLOWED!

1234
00:59:25.657 --> 00:59:28.039
THIS MEANS
YOU LAUREN...


1235
00:59:28.073 --> 00:59:29.903
GOD, HE WAS LIKE
TWICE YOUR AGE.


1236
00:59:32.664 --> 00:59:34.493
NEW RULES MY ASS!

1237
00:59:45.366 --> 00:59:47.092
HEY, NICE WORK!

1238
00:59:47.127 --> 00:59:50.095
WHAT WAS THAT THING
ABOUT LAUREN?


1239
00:59:50.130 --> 00:59:52.684
I DO NOT EVEN WANT
TO TALK ABOUT IT.


1240
00:59:52.719 --> 00:59:54.134
WELL, I DON'T KNOW
WHY YOU DID IT,


1241
00:59:54.168 --> 00:59:55.860
BUT YOU ARE A FLIPPIN'
GENIUS. THANK YOU!


1242
00:59:55.894 --> 00:59:58.483
YOU ARE WELCOME.

1243
00:59:58.517 --> 01:00:01.141
BUT SERIOUSLY, I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE SO WORRIED ABOUT.


1244
01:00:01.175 --> 01:00:02.798
YOU HAVE
A GREAT BODY.


1245
01:00:02.832 --> 01:00:05.766
NOT REALLY.

1246
01:00:05.801 --> 01:00:07.803
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?


1247
01:00:07.837 --> 01:00:09.597
YOU'RE LIKE A STATUE!

1248
01:00:09.632 --> 01:00:12.462
A GAWKY ONE WITH SHITTY HAIR,
BUT STILL... A STATUE.


1249
01:00:18.468 --> 01:00:19.297
WHAT?

1250
01:00:19.331 --> 01:00:21.264
I'M NOT A
FUCKING STATUE!


1251
01:00:21.299 --> 01:00:22.231
I HAVE...

1252
01:00:22.265 --> 01:00:22.956
WHAT?

1253
01:00:22.990 --> 01:00:25.510
NO BOOBS AND A FAT ASS.

1254
01:00:25.544 --> 01:00:29.341
YOU DO NOT KNOW WHAT I'VE BEEN
THROUGH MY ENTIRE FRICKIN' LIFE


1255
01:00:29.376 --> 01:00:31.205
SINCE I
WAS FOURTEEN!


1256
01:00:33.242 --> 01:00:34.968
MY MOM?

1257
01:00:35.002 --> 01:00:36.935
FORMER FUCKING
BEAUTY QUEEN, OK?


1258
01:00:36.970 --> 01:00:38.247
LIKE, SERIOUSLY?

1259
01:00:38.281 --> 01:00:39.800
IMAGINE GROWING UP
IN THAT HOUSE.


1260
01:00:39.835 --> 01:00:41.802
LIKE, ALL SHE
COULD TALK ABOUT WAS,


1261
01:00:41.837 --> 01:00:44.115
"GET OFF YOUR FAT ASS
CHARLIE, AND GO WORK OUT.


1262
01:00:44.149 --> 01:00:46.117
GO GET IN SHAPE.
DON'T EAT THAT. "


1263
01:00:46.151 --> 01:00:47.981
I KNOW!
MOMENT OF TRUTH?


1264
01:00:51.191 --> 01:00:53.020
I TOTALLY FUCK
WITH THE LIGHTS OFF.


1265
01:00:58.854 --> 01:01:00.579
WHY?

1266
01:01:00.614 --> 01:01:03.824
I CAN'T EVEN BELIEVE I'M
ABOUT TO SAY THIS...UM...


1267
01:01:03.859 --> 01:01:04.825
FIRST GRADE.

1268
01:01:04.860 --> 01:01:08.691
DAMON ROTH...
CALLED ME "CHUNKY".


1269
01:01:08.725 --> 01:01:11.659
I'M STILL ON
A DIET.


1270
01:01:11.694 --> 01:01:14.421
I SAW YOU NAKED, AND YOU
HAVE NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT.


1271
01:01:14.455 --> 01:01:15.905
THANK YOU!

1272
01:01:15.940 --> 01:01:16.803
CHEERS.

1273
01:01:18.425 --> 01:01:20.427
WELL, THAT'S NOT WHAT
EVERYONE THINKS.


1274
01:01:27.641 --> 01:01:30.437
SO, WE'RE TYPICAL
AMERICAN CHICKS.


1275
01:01:30.471 --> 01:01:31.438
WAA WAA WAA.

1276
01:01:31.472 --> 01:01:32.439
RIGHT?

1277
01:01:32.473 --> 01:01:34.303
ALRIGHT SERIOUSLY,
ORANGE JUICE?


1278
01:01:34.337 --> 01:01:36.512
THIS TOAST IS
FUCKIN' DISGUTING.


1279
01:01:36.546 --> 01:01:37.409
BUT HERE'S
THE THING...


1280
01:01:37.444 --> 01:01:38.445
I MADE IT.

1281
01:01:39.687 --> 01:01:41.344
THEN YOU NEED
A BETTER TOASTER.


1282
01:01:41.379 --> 01:01:43.174
THIS IS WHAT'S WEIRD--

1283
01:01:43.208 --> 01:01:44.623
AND I SO CANNOT BELIEVE
I'M ABOUT TO SAY THIS--


1284
01:01:44.658 --> 01:01:46.453
BUT THIS PLACE?

1285
01:01:46.487 --> 01:01:49.283
THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT IT THAT
DOESN'T MAKE YOU FEEL THAT WAY.


1286
01:01:49.318 --> 01:01:50.871
I MEAN, THAT'S KINDA WHY I DID
WHAT I DID AT BREAKFAST


1287
01:01:50.906 --> 01:01:51.803
THE OTHER DAY.

1288
01:01:51.838 --> 01:01:53.874
BULLSHIT! YOU DID IT
TO IMPRESS A DUDE.


1289
01:01:53.909 --> 01:01:54.910
I DID NOT!

1290
01:02:00.467 --> 01:02:03.435
ALRIGHT MAYBE... A LITTE.
BUT DUDE, WHATEVER!


1291
01:02:03.470 --> 01:02:06.300
LIKE... IT WAS ACTUALLY...
KIND OF LIBERATING.


1292
01:02:12.962 --> 01:02:14.308
WELL HEY, LISTEN.

1293
01:02:14.343 --> 01:02:17.139
I'M GONNA HEAD UP
TO THAT LAKE I THINK.


1294
01:02:17.173 --> 01:02:18.899
OOO, GO FOR IT.

1295
01:02:18.934 --> 01:02:21.281
I ACTUALLY NEED TO TAKE CARE
OF SOME BUSINESS TOO.


1296
01:02:21.315 --> 01:02:22.765
NEED A HAND?

1297
01:02:22.799 --> 01:02:24.732
NO, I'M GOOD.

1298
01:02:24.767 --> 01:02:26.596
ALRIGHT, HAVE FUN.

1299
01:02:33.776 --> 01:02:36.158
OH. MY. FUCKING. GOD.

1300
01:02:41.853 --> 01:02:43.820
WHAT THE FUCK IS
WRONG WITH---


1301
01:02:43.855 --> 01:02:46.409
LEAH, STOP!

1302
01:02:46.444 --> 01:02:47.652
WHAT WAS THAT?

1303
01:02:47.686 --> 01:02:49.343
AN ATTEMPT AT TEACHING
YOU A LESSON.


1304
01:02:49.378 --> 01:02:51.828
WHAT... DON'T OPEN
THE DOOR FOR STRANGERS?


1305
01:02:51.863 --> 01:02:53.969
DON'T FUCK
MY DAD.


1306
01:02:54.003 --> 01:02:55.246
WHO TOLD
YOU THAT?


1307
01:02:55.280 --> 01:02:56.937
IT DOESN'T MATTER.
IT'S TRUE.


1308
01:02:56.972 --> 01:02:57.938
YOU DON'T
UNDERSTAND.


1309
01:02:57.973 --> 01:02:59.250
I DON'T.

1310
01:02:59.284 --> 01:03:01.424
I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY HE WOULD
LEAVE A PERFECTLY GOOD FAMILY


1311
01:03:01.459 --> 01:03:04.496
AT HOME TO COME FUCK
SOME SLUTTY LIFEGUARD?


1312
01:03:04.531 --> 01:03:05.739
THAT'S NOT
WHAT IT WAS--


1313
01:03:05.773 --> 01:03:06.982
LOOK AT YOU.

1314
01:03:07.016 --> 01:03:09.398
YOU'RE A KID.
YOU'RE LIKE, MY AGE.


1315
01:03:09.432 --> 01:03:11.400
YOUR DAD DIDN'T
SEE ME THAT WAY.


1316
01:03:11.434 --> 01:03:14.265
WELL I'M LOOKING RIGHT AT YOU

1317
01:03:14.299 --> 01:03:15.576
A DISTRACTION.

1318
01:03:15.611 --> 01:03:16.577
AND BRAVO LAUREN,

1319
01:03:16.612 --> 01:03:18.407
BECAUSE NO ONE EVEN
KNEW THAT WE EXISTED!


1320
01:03:18.441 --> 01:03:20.788
I MEAN, RUSTY DIDN'T
EVEN CALL US WHEN HE DIED.


1321
01:03:20.823 --> 01:03:22.687
THAT'S NOT TRUE,
I KNEW ALL ABOUT YOU.


1322
01:03:22.721 --> 01:03:24.965
NED TALKED ABOUT YOU
ALL THE TIME!


1323
01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:27.657
HE WAS SO PROUD
OF YOU.


1324
01:03:27.692 --> 01:03:32.869
HE WAS ALWAYS SAYING THAT SOON
YOU'D BE THE ONE SUPPORTING HIM.


1325
01:03:32.904 --> 01:03:34.699
YEAH, HE SAID
THAT TO ME TOO.


1326
01:03:34.733 --> 01:03:36.528
YEAH.

1327
01:03:36.563 --> 01:03:39.324
SEE, HE REALLY WANTED TO
TELL YOU ABOUT THIS PLACE,


1328
01:03:39.359 --> 01:03:42.845
HE JUST DIDN'T KNOW
HOW YOU'D REACT.


1329
01:03:42.879 --> 01:03:45.848
HE SAID YOU HAD SOME
ISSUES ABOUT YOUR BODY--


1330
01:03:45.882 --> 01:03:47.263
HE TALKED TO YOU
ABOUT THAT?


1331
01:03:47.298 --> 01:03:48.920
HE DIDN'T KNOW HOW
TO TALK TO YOU.


1332
01:03:48.955 --> 01:03:51.095
AND I TOLD HIM
HE SHOULD TELL YOU,


1333
01:03:51.129 --> 01:03:54.098
BUT HE THOUGHT YOU WOULDN'T
WANT TO HAVE ANYTHING


1334
01:03:54.132 --> 01:03:55.996
TO DO WITH
THIS PLACE.


1335
01:03:56.031 --> 01:03:59.931
BUT LOOK,
YOU'RE HERE NOW.


1336
01:03:59.966 --> 01:04:02.623
SO MAYBE THIS IS YOUR CHANCE
TO PROVE HIM WRONG...


1337
01:04:02.658 --> 01:04:05.454
I DON'T HAVE ANYTHING
TO PROVE, LAUREN.


1338
01:04:05.488 --> 01:04:09.492
I JUST WANTED TO TELL YOU
THAT WHAT YOU DID WAS WRONG.


1339
01:04:19.330 --> 01:04:21.228
HEY, JOE!

1340
01:04:21.263 --> 01:04:23.058
PLEASE TELL ME
SOMETHING GOOD.


1341
01:04:23.092 --> 01:04:25.336
YOU'RE BREAKING UP.

1342
01:04:25.370 --> 01:04:27.855
JOE?

1343
01:04:27.890 --> 01:04:30.030
WHAT?

1344
01:04:30.065 --> 01:04:30.893
HOLD ON JOE.

1345
01:04:32.999 --> 01:04:33.827
JOE?

1346
01:04:46.322 --> 01:04:49.153
PROPANE HEATER!
I HAVE NO CLUE.


1347
01:04:53.295 --> 01:04:54.503
YOU KNOW WHAT?
HOLD ON.


1348
01:04:54.537 --> 01:04:56.263
I THINK I SEE SOMEONE WHO
MIGHT BE ABLE TO ANSWER THAT.


1349
01:04:56.298 --> 01:04:58.162
EXCUSE ME!

1350
01:04:58.196 --> 01:04:59.646
NATALIE, RIGHT?

1351
01:04:59.680 --> 01:05:01.061
YEAH, WHAT'S UP?

1352
01:05:01.096 --> 01:05:02.407
CAN YOU TELL ME IF ANY
OF THE CABINS HERE


1353
01:05:02.442 --> 01:05:03.926
ARE RUN WITH
PROPANE HEAT?


1354
01:05:03.960 --> 01:05:06.549
WELL... THE CABINS RUN ON
ELECTRIC SPACE HEATERS,


1355
01:05:06.584 --> 01:05:07.585
BUT THE RESTAURANT
AND BAR...


1356
01:05:07.619 --> 01:05:08.931
JUST A SECOND,
JOE.


1357
01:05:08.965 --> 01:05:10.450
WHO WANTS
TO KNOW?


1358
01:05:10.484 --> 01:05:12.107
MY REALTOR.

1359
01:05:12.141 --> 01:05:13.039
I THINK THIS IS SOMETHING

1360
01:05:13.073 --> 01:05:14.281
YOU SHOULD BE TALKING
TO KRISTI ABOUT.


1361
01:05:14.316 --> 01:05:16.490
FINE. ALRIGHT JOE, SHE
SAYS THAT THE CABINS


1362
01:05:16.525 --> 01:05:19.321
ARE RUN ON
ELECTRIC SPACE HEATERS.


1363
01:05:19.355 --> 01:05:21.806
JOE? JOE, CAN
YOU HEAR ME?


1364
01:05:21.840 --> 01:05:25.603
JOE? JOE?

1365
01:05:25.637 --> 01:05:28.157
GOD... I HATE
THIS PLACE!


1366
01:05:28.192 --> 01:05:30.642
YOU KNOW, I'D WATCH HOW LOUDLY
YOU SAY STUFF LIKE THAT.


1367
01:05:33.093 --> 01:05:33.921
HEY CHARLIE.

1368
01:05:36.752 --> 01:05:42.585
MAN, I'M REALLY STRIKING
OUT WITH THIS FAMILY TODAY.


1369
01:05:46.279 --> 01:05:49.420
SO... WHAT ARE
YOU LISTENING TO?


1370
01:05:49.454 --> 01:05:53.009
OH, SHE'S THIS, LIKE,
INDIE ROCK CHICK


1371
01:05:53.044 --> 01:05:56.116
THAT NOBODY'S
EVER HEARD OF.


1372
01:05:56.151 --> 01:05:59.119
RACHEL YAMAGATA?

1373
01:05:59.154 --> 01:06:01.466
NO SHIT.
CHECK IT OUT.


1374
01:06:06.437 --> 01:06:08.439
YOU HAVE SOMETHING IN
COMMON WITH A NUDIST!


1375
01:06:10.855 --> 01:06:11.683
SCARY.

1376
01:06:12.926 --> 01:06:15.135
I AM SORRY YOU'RE HAVING
TO GO THROUGH ALL THIS.


1377
01:06:15.170 --> 01:06:17.241
RIGHT.

1378
01:06:17.275 --> 01:06:18.759
I WOULD GIVE
ANYTHING NATALIE,


1379
01:06:18.794 --> 01:06:20.899
ANYTHING, JUST TO HAVE
A LITTLE BIT OF INSIGHT.


1380
01:06:20.934 --> 01:06:22.108
YOU GUYS ALL SEEM
TO KNOW MY DAD.


1381
01:06:22.142 --> 01:06:24.489
TO ME HE WAS LIKE
A STRANGER.


1382
01:06:24.524 --> 01:06:25.387
OKAY, FINE...

1383
01:06:25.421 --> 01:06:26.388
IF I TELL YOU
SOMETHING,


1384
01:06:26.422 --> 01:06:28.838
WILL YOU PROMISE NOT
TO GO AND TELL CHARLIE?


1385
01:06:28.873 --> 01:06:29.874
YEAH.

1386
01:06:34.430 --> 01:06:37.744
SO ARE YOU DOCUMENTING
YOUR NIGHTMARE WEEKEND


1387
01:06:37.778 --> 01:06:40.471
HERE AT BEAR LAKE?

1388
01:06:40.505 --> 01:06:44.820
THIS? OH, IT'S...
NED'S.


1389
01:06:44.854 --> 01:06:45.855
OH.

1390
01:06:51.585 --> 01:06:53.760
DO YOU WANT TO KNOW
THE TRUTH?


1391
01:06:53.794 --> 01:06:56.590
YES, PLEASE.

1392
01:06:56.625 --> 01:06:58.765
YOU'RE MOM KNEW
ABOUT THIS PLACE.


1393
01:06:58.799 --> 01:07:00.905
SHE KNEW ABOUT
LAUREN TOO.


1394
01:07:00.939 --> 01:07:01.940
SHUT UP.

1395
01:07:06.186 --> 01:07:07.670
NO, SHE DIDN'T...

1396
01:07:07.705 --> 01:07:09.534
YEAH, SHE DID.

1397
01:07:12.848 --> 01:07:14.229
SO WHAT BROUGHT
YOU HERE?


1398
01:07:14.263 --> 01:07:16.127
DID YOU GET LOST ON
YOUR WAY TO BONNAROO?


1399
01:07:16.162 --> 01:07:18.509
HONESTLY, IT WAS KIND
OF AN ACCIDENT.


1400
01:07:18.543 --> 01:07:20.856
YOU ACCIDENTALLY
BECAME A NUDIST.


1401
01:07:20.890 --> 01:07:21.926
WELL...

1402
01:07:21.960 --> 01:07:22.927
HOW DOES
THAT HAPPEN?


1403
01:07:22.961 --> 01:07:24.273
I WAS A RUNNER
IN COLLEGE,


1404
01:07:24.308 --> 01:07:26.068
AND WE'D ALWAYS DO
THESE TRAINING RUNS


1405
01:07:26.102 --> 01:07:28.174
THAT TOOK UP DOWN THE TRAIL,
PAST BEAR LAKE.


1406
01:07:28.208 --> 01:07:29.761
THE BIG JOKE WAS ABOUT
COMING DOWN HERE,


1407
01:07:29.796 --> 01:07:31.763
BUT NOBODY EVER DID...

1408
01:07:31.798 --> 01:07:34.283
SO ONE DAY, I TOOK THE TURN,
I CAME DOWN HERE...


1409
01:07:34.318 --> 01:07:39.254
TOOK OFF MY SHOES AND MY SOCKS
AND THEN I KIND OF SAT HERE.


1410
01:07:39.288 --> 01:07:40.738
TILL I FINALLY GOT UP
THE COURAGE


1411
01:07:40.772 --> 01:07:42.671
AND JUST RAN
INTO THE WATER.


1412
01:07:42.705 --> 01:07:44.224
YOU KNOW,
THINKING ABOUT IT


1413
01:07:44.259 --> 01:07:47.848
IS SO MUCH WORSE THAN
ACTUALLY DOING IT.


1414
01:07:47.883 --> 01:07:49.505
IT FELT GREAT!

1415
01:07:49.540 --> 01:07:53.302
I REMEMBER STANDING
THERE--RIGHT OVER THERE--


1416
01:07:53.337 --> 01:07:55.166
AND THEN SOMEONE
STOLE MY CLOTHES!


1417
01:07:55.201 --> 01:07:56.098
WHAT?

1418
01:07:56.132 --> 01:07:57.617
YEAH!

1419
01:07:57.651 --> 01:07:59.584
I LOOKED AWAY FOR A SECOND
AND THEY WERE GONE.


1420
01:07:59.619 --> 01:08:01.621
MY SHORTS, MY SHOES,
MY KEY TO THE DORMS,


1421
01:08:01.655 --> 01:08:03.139
ALL OF IT.

1422
01:08:03.174 --> 01:08:05.556
GETTING BACK WAS A MESS.

1423
01:08:05.590 --> 01:08:07.282
NOT MY FINEST HOUR.

1424
01:08:07.316 --> 01:08:09.180
BUT I STILL CAME BACK.

1425
01:08:09.215 --> 01:08:11.182
EVEN AFTER THAT.

1426
01:08:11.217 --> 01:08:12.839
I MET KRISTI, SHE
OFFERED ME THE JOB...


1427
01:08:12.873 --> 01:08:17.464
I'VE NEVER
LOOKED BACK.


1428
01:08:17.499 --> 01:08:21.503
YOUR PARENTS DIDN'T EXACTLY
HAVE A STORYBOOK MARRIAGE.


1429
01:08:21.537 --> 01:08:23.090
YEAH,
THEY'RE HUMAN.


1430
01:08:23.125 --> 01:08:24.782
JUST LIKE ANY
OTHER COUPLE, THEY FOUGHT...


1431
01:08:24.816 --> 01:08:26.162
BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY,
THEY WERE HAPPY.


1432
01:08:26.197 --> 01:08:28.199
A FEW YEARS AGO
THEY ALMOST HAD A DIVORCE.


1433
01:08:31.202 --> 01:08:32.030
YEAH.

1434
01:08:33.618 --> 01:08:34.999
I MEAN YOUR DAD FELT
REALLY GUILTY


1435
01:08:35.033 --> 01:08:37.450
ABOUT SCREWING THINGS
UP WITH CHARLIE -


1436
01:08:37.484 --> 01:08:38.727
AND THAT CAUSED A LOT
OF PROBLEMS -


1437
01:08:38.761 --> 01:08:40.142
AND HE WANTED
TO LEAVE.


1438
01:08:40.176 --> 01:08:42.144
BUT YOUR PARENTS WANTED
YOU TO HAVE A SENSE SECURITY,


1439
01:08:42.178 --> 01:08:45.768
SO THEY AGREED
TO STAY TOGETHER...


1440
01:08:45.803 --> 01:08:47.736
AT LEAST UNTIL YOU
FINISHED COLLEGE...


1441
01:08:47.770 --> 01:08:50.325
AT WHICH POINT, THEY
BASICALLY SEPARATED.


1442
01:08:50.359 --> 01:08:51.567
BUT THEN THEY FIGURED
THE ARRANGEMENT


1443
01:08:51.602 --> 01:08:54.501
HAD BEEN WORKING SO
WELL FOR SO MANY YEARS...


1444
01:08:54.536 --> 01:08:57.366
WHY TO CHANGE SOMETHING
THAT WORKED?


1445
01:09:03.959 --> 01:09:05.788
ARE YOU OK?

1446
01:09:14.797 --> 01:09:18.560
UM... THAT WAS...
FOR YOUR EYES.


1447
01:09:21.528 --> 01:09:24.566
OH! I WILL ABSOLUTELY
WASH THAT.


1448
01:09:24.600 --> 01:09:26.119
THE THING
IS CHARLIE,


1449
01:09:26.153 --> 01:09:28.086
YOU GOTTA DO YOUR OWN
THING, YOU KNOW?


1450
01:09:28.121 --> 01:09:30.192
SELL THE PLACE,
WHATEVER.


1451
01:09:30.226 --> 01:09:33.851
I'LL BE FINE.

1452
01:09:33.885 --> 01:09:35.991
BUT JUST TAKE IT
EASY ON CORY.


1453
01:09:36.025 --> 01:09:39.857
THIS PLACE REALLY IS THE ONLY
HOME HE'S EVER KNOWN.


1454
01:09:39.891 --> 01:09:41.790
I'VE GOT A CLASS
I'VE GOTTA TEACH.


1455
01:09:41.824 --> 01:09:43.205
SEE YA 'ROUND?

1456
01:09:43.239 --> 01:09:44.068
YEAH.

1457
01:09:50.316 --> 01:09:51.524
FOUR WORDS, LADIES...

1458
01:09:51.558 --> 01:09:55.631
HOT
-TUB
-HAPPY
-HOUR!

1459
01:09:55.666 --> 01:09:57.771
NO CAN DO TREVOR,

1460
01:09:57.806 --> 01:09:59.014
I'VE GOT TO GET
TO YOGA CLASS,


1461
01:09:59.048 --> 01:10:00.947
THEN I'VE GOTTA PICK
THE HUBBY UP FROM WORK.


1462
01:10:00.981 --> 01:10:04.088
BUT I THINK THIS ONE
COULD USE A LITTLE THIRST AID.


1463
01:10:04.122 --> 01:10:05.952
WHAT DO YOU SAY?
YOU IN?


1464
01:10:07.471 --> 01:10:08.334
YEAH.

1465
01:10:09.783 --> 01:10:11.198
I'LL SEE YOU
LATER, OK?


1466
01:10:11.233 --> 01:10:12.061
YEAH.

1467
01:11:44.257 --> 01:11:45.914
HEY, HAS ANYONE
SEEN CHARLIE?


1468
01:11:45.948 --> 01:11:47.122
YEAH, I TALKED
TO HER A WHILE AGO...


1469
01:11:47.156 --> 01:11:49.676
OOO, I SEE
CHARLIE!


1470
01:11:49.711 --> 01:11:55.095
HEY! ALRIGHT! GOOD JOB!

1471
01:11:55.130 --> 01:11:56.303
WE KNEW YOU
HAD IT IN YOU!


1472
01:11:56.338 --> 01:11:58.823
COME OVER HERE,
SIT NEXT TO ME!


1473
01:11:58.858 --> 01:12:01.516
THEY GROW UP
SO FAST.


1474
01:12:01.550 --> 01:12:02.827
WHO'S DRINKING
AROUND HERE?


1475
01:12:02.862 --> 01:12:04.864
YOU GOT A BEER FOR
ME, SOMEONE?


1476
01:12:05.416 --> 01:12:09.144
THANKS,
SIS.


1477
01:12:09.178 --> 01:12:10.870
CHEERS! CHEERS!

1478
01:12:10.904 --> 01:12:12.734
WELCOME TO
THE CULT.


1479
01:13:03.025 --> 01:13:04.026
COME IN!

1480
01:13:07.409 --> 01:13:10.585
HEY.
CAN I COME IN?


1481
01:13:10.619 --> 01:13:11.620
YES. YEAH.

1482
01:13:17.661 --> 01:13:20.008
SO YOU'RE BACK
IN THE BUFF?


1483
01:13:20.042 --> 01:13:21.527
I AM.

1484
01:13:21.561 --> 01:13:25.289
I LIKE IT... WHY THE
CHANGE OF HEART?


1485
01:13:25.323 --> 01:13:26.462
BECAUSE I WANTED
TO APOLOGIZE


1486
01:13:26.497 --> 01:13:29.189
FOR BEING AN ASSHOLE
THE OTHER NIGHT.


1487
01:13:29.224 --> 01:13:32.986
AND I KIND THOUGHT THAT THIS
WAS THE RIGHT WAY TO DO IT.


1488
01:13:33.021 --> 01:13:35.541
YOU KNOW...

1489
01:13:35.575 --> 01:13:37.819
I'M SORRY YOU HAD
TO FIND OUT THAT WAY.


1490
01:13:37.853 --> 01:13:40.960
THANK YOU.

1491
01:13:40.994 --> 01:13:44.964
YOU'RE A
MUSICIAN TOO.


1492
01:13:44.998 --> 01:13:48.623
YOU ARE SO GIFTED!
IT'S JUST NOT FAIR.


1493
01:13:48.657 --> 01:13:50.452
OK, THIS IS WHAT I
DON'T UNDERSTAND--


1494
01:13:50.486 --> 01:13:53.075
AND I DO NOT MEAN FOR THIS
TO COME OUT THE WRONG WAY--


1495
01:13:53.110 --> 01:13:56.078
BUT YOU REALIZE YOU COULD
BE CRAZY SUCCESSFUL


1496
01:13:56.113 --> 01:13:57.666
IN THE OUTSIDE WORLD,
RIGHT?


1497
01:13:57.701 --> 01:14:02.188
SO WHY DO YOU CHOOSE
TO WORK HERE?


1498
01:14:02.222 --> 01:14:06.606
YOU KNOW, I USED TO BE A PART
OF THE OUTSIDE WORLD.


1499
01:14:06.641 --> 01:14:07.780
I DIDN'T
GROW UP HERE.


1500
01:14:07.814 --> 01:14:10.092
I WAS ACTUALLY IN
MED-SCHOOL BEFORE I CAME.


1501
01:14:10.127 --> 01:14:12.301
WHOA!

1502
01:14:12.336 --> 01:14:15.960
BUT I DIDN'T LIKE
THE PERSON I WAS BECOMING...


1503
01:14:15.995 --> 01:14:18.238
I WAS FAKE.

1504
01:14:18.273 --> 01:14:21.345
MAKING CONNECTIONS
WITH FAKE PEOPLE...


1505
01:14:21.379 --> 01:14:24.486
AND I STARTED TO
HATE MYSELF.


1506
01:14:24.520 --> 01:14:27.006
AS SOON AS I'D WALK
THROUGH THE DOOR AT NIGHT...


1507
01:14:27.040 --> 01:14:30.147
THE FURTHER I STEPPED OUT OF
CHARACTER WHEN I WAS AT HOME...


1508
01:14:30.181 --> 01:14:33.288
THE CLOSER I GOT TO
WHO I WANTED TO BE.


1509
01:14:33.322 --> 01:14:34.634
IT WAS MISERABLE.

1510
01:14:34.669 --> 01:14:36.325
I MEAN, I DIDN'T
WANT TO BE A DOCTOR.


1511
01:14:36.360 --> 01:14:38.293
SOMEONE ELSE WANTED
THAT FOR ME.


1512
01:14:38.327 --> 01:14:40.157
SO I QUIT.

1513
01:14:42.677 --> 01:14:45.749
COINCIDENTALLY, MY
GIRLFRIEND QUIT ON ME.


1514
01:14:45.783 --> 01:14:48.372
THEN I WENT ON
THIS JOURNEY...


1515
01:14:48.406 --> 01:14:49.822
PACKED UP AND LEFT.

1516
01:14:49.856 --> 01:14:53.584
THEN I STUMBLED
UPON THIS PLACE.


1517
01:14:53.619 --> 01:14:55.448
AND I'M HAPPY HERE.

1518
01:15:03.318 --> 01:15:05.182
TREV,
I'M SORRY.


1519
01:15:05.216 --> 01:15:07.011
I KNOW
I SCREWED UP.


1520
01:15:07.046 --> 01:15:09.842
I WAS JUST HURT, AND UPSET,
AND CONFUSED,


1521
01:15:09.876 --> 01:15:12.741
AND I TOOK IT OUT ON YOU...
AND, THE WHOLE RESORT FOR--


1522
01:15:12.776 --> 01:15:15.364
LEAH. IT'S OK.

1523
01:15:15.399 --> 01:15:17.021
REALLY?

1524
01:15:17.056 --> 01:15:18.264
REALLY.

1525
01:15:18.298 --> 01:15:20.300
NO, LIKE
REALLY REALLY?


1526
01:15:20.335 --> 01:15:22.337
LIKE, REALLY
REALLY.


1527
01:15:28.654 --> 01:15:33.659
SO, CHARLIE, YOU THINK YOU MIGHT
KEEP THE PLACE AFTER ALL?


1528
01:15:33.693 --> 01:15:36.178
GOT A MILLION DOLLARS
TO GIVE ME?


1529
01:15:36.213 --> 01:15:39.078
I KNEW IT.

1530
01:15:39.112 --> 01:15:41.321
WHAT?

1531
01:15:41.356 --> 01:15:43.703
I THOUGHT YOU WERE
STARTING TO ENJOY YOURSELF.


1532
01:15:43.738 --> 01:15:44.842
YOU SEEMED SO
HAPPY TONIGHT.


1533
01:15:44.877 --> 01:15:46.292
I KNOW.

1534
01:15:46.326 --> 01:15:50.089
I AM BUT...
IT'S JUST, YOU KNOW.


1535
01:15:50.123 --> 01:15:52.919
IT'S ABOUT
THE CASH.


1536
01:15:52.954 --> 01:15:54.956
SO NOW, IT'S ALL
ABOUT THE CASH.


1537
01:15:57.993 --> 01:15:59.305
I MEAN, LOOK.

1538
01:15:59.339 --> 01:16:01.928
IT'S BEEN ABOUT
THE MONEY


1539
01:16:01.963 --> 01:16:05.207
EVER SINCE MY DAD LEFT
MY MOM WITHOUT A CENT.


1540
01:16:05.242 --> 01:16:06.484
YOU KNOW?

1541
01:16:06.519 --> 01:16:10.074
AND HE'S NEVER GIVEN
ME ANYTHING...


1542
01:16:10.109 --> 01:16:11.938
EXCEPT THIS PLACE.

1543
01:16:17.357 --> 01:16:19.187
SO YOU'RE NOT GONNA LET US
LIVE HERE ANYMORE?


1544
01:16:24.157 --> 01:16:29.335
I... I DON'T MEAN TO KICK
YOU GUYS OUT OF YOUR HOME.


1545
01:16:29.369 --> 01:16:32.510
WOW, THAT'S REALLY NOT
MY INTENTION AT ALL.


1546
01:16:32.545 --> 01:16:34.029
LEAH JUST RAN
THE NUMBERS


1547
01:16:34.064 --> 01:16:36.514
AND THIS PLACE JUST
ISN'T MAKING ANY MONEY.


1548
01:16:36.549 --> 01:16:38.378
SO THAT'S IT?

1549
01:16:40.656 --> 01:16:42.037
YEAH.

1550
01:16:42.072 --> 01:16:44.108
YOU KNOW, THE REAL
WORLD EXISTS.


1551
01:16:44.143 --> 01:16:45.351
IT'S OUT THERE.

1552
01:16:45.385 --> 01:16:47.318
I KNOW YOU GUYS
DON'T WANT TO DEAL IT,


1553
01:16:47.353 --> 01:16:50.494
BUT I HAVE BILLS AND
RENT AND SHIT TO PAY,


1554
01:16:50.528 --> 01:16:52.668
AND ALL THAT
STUFF HAPPENS


1555
01:16:52.703 --> 01:16:55.706
OUTSIDE THIS SWEET
LITTLE BUBBLE.


1556
01:17:00.228 --> 01:17:01.539
CORY!

1557
01:17:01.574 --> 01:17:02.989

1558
01:17:05.992 --> 01:17:07.960

1559
01:17:07.994 --> 01:17:10.065
CORY! HONEY...

01:17:20.627 --> 01:17:22.837
DON'T APOLOGIZE.

1562
01:17:22.871 --> 01:17:25.149
DO WHAT YOU
THINK IS RIGHT.


1563
01:17:25.184 --> 01:17:27.186
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT'S RIGHT...


1564
01:17:49.242 --> 01:17:50.105
SHIT!

1565
01:17:50.140 --> 01:17:51.520

1569
01:17:59.494 --> 01:18:01.496

1570
01:18:01.530 --> 01:18:02.531

WHAT THE FUCK!

1575
01:18:13.508 --> 01:18:15.096

1576
01:18:15.130 --> 01:18:16.683

1577
01:18:16.718 --> 01:18:17.684
WHERE DO YOU

1578
01:18:17.719 --> 01:18:18.927
WHERE HAVE
YOU BEEN?


1579
01:18:18.962 --> 01:18:21.861
THANK YOU.

1580
01:18:21.896 --> 01:18:23.173
AND WE CAN TALK
ABOUT THAT LATER.


1581
01:18:23.207 --> 01:18:24.553
OH, YES WE CAN.

1582
01:18:24.588 --> 01:18:25.831
WE'RE SO LATE.

1583
01:18:25.865 --> 01:18:27.487
I KNOW, I KNOW.

1584
01:18:27.522 --> 01:18:28.834
SO YOU HAD
A GOODNIGHT.


1585
01:18:28.868 --> 01:18:30.697
IT WAS PRETTY
FUCKIN' AMAZING.


1586
01:18:33.562 --> 01:18:35.530
UGH, WE'RE
SO LATE.


1587
01:18:35.564 --> 01:18:37.359
WILL YOU LOCK
THE DOOR?


1588
01:18:37.394 --> 01:18:39.706
YES!

1589
01:18:39.741 --> 01:18:40.949
IT'S YOUR FAULT
WE'RE LATE.

1596
01:20:13.904 --> 01:20:16.044

01:20:23.569 --> 01:20:24.777
WELL LEAH,
IF YOU'RE GOING,


1603
01:20:24.811 --> 01:20:27.021
I'D REALLY LOVE A CHANCE TO
APOLOGIZE BEFORE YOU LEAVE.


1604
01:20:27.055 --> 01:20:29.023
HONESTLY,
IT'S NOT NECESSARY.


1605
01:20:29.057 --> 01:20:30.610
I JUST DON'T LIKE
TO LEAVE THINGS


1606
01:20:30.645 --> 01:20:31.646
THE WAY THAT
WE LEFT THEM.


1607
01:20:31.680 --> 01:20:33.475
REALLY, IT'S WATER
UNDER THE BRIDGE.


1608
01:20:33.510 --> 01:20:34.338
OK.

1609
01:20:35.857 --> 01:20:38.860

1634
01:22:28.797 --> 01:22:33.181
