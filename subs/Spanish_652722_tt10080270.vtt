1
00:01:06.843 --> 00:01:09.053
I have the tendency
to always assume the worst.


2
00:01:09.095 --> 00:01:12.056
To be paranoid.
To move with caution.


3
00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:14.601
That has been my life.

4
00:01:14.642 --> 00:01:18.021
In a world of drugs,
murderers, and slavery.


5
00:01:19.647 --> 00:01:21.483
I doubt I will
ever be able to understand

6
00:01:21.524 --> 00:01:23.109
what happened
the last nine years of my life.


7
00:01:24.402 --> 00:01:27.781
I don't know.
Things could have been different.


8
00:01:29.073 --> 00:01:31.659
He must have had his reasons
to have done what he did.


9
00:01:37.791 --> 00:01:42.045
IN THE ARMS OF AN ASSASSIN

10
00:02:40.603 --> 00:02:44.107
Welcome. My house is your house.

11
00:02:44.941 --> 00:02:46.192
Come in.

12
00:02:47.485 --> 00:02:48.862
Have a seat.

13
00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:52.449
Would you like a drink?

14
00:02:53.366 --> 00:02:55.743
The best tequila in Mexico.

15
00:02:56.536 --> 00:02:58.079
Don't drink it fast.

16
00:02:59.706 --> 00:03:01.040
You must drink it slowly.

17
00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:04.085
You must enjoy it.

18
00:03:19.642 --> 00:03:22.854
I agreed to come here because you
promised I wouldn't waste my time.


19
00:03:26.316 --> 00:03:27.942
Tell the whore to go
or there's nothing to talk about.


20
00:03:29.444 --> 00:03:30.820
I'm his sister, asshole.

21
00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:39.996
-Who is he?
-I don't know, but he's a foreigner.


22
00:03:41.247 --> 00:03:42.373
Now...

23
00:03:43.291 --> 00:03:44.125
we're ready.

24
00:03:45.043 --> 00:03:49.672
Let's talk business.
Three million for Guzman's head.


25
00:03:51.716 --> 00:03:55.637
I understand your price is two million.

26
00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:59.516
That's a very generous offer.

27
00:04:00.308 --> 00:04:01.976
Or a very desperate one.

28
00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:08.858
I think that the one you want me to kill
will pay me double for your head.


29
00:04:18.952 --> 00:04:21.246
My reasons are not your concern.

30
00:04:23.498 --> 00:04:24.999
You're right.

31
00:04:27.001 --> 00:04:30.505
The only thing that matters is that you
tell Guillermo back there to drop the gun.


32
00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:34.884
If he doesn't do it in three seconds,
I'll kill him.


33
00:04:58.324 --> 00:04:59.451
Clean that!

34
00:05:04.289 --> 00:05:07.500
-What are you doing?
-Take your things, we're leaving.


35
00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:13.047
-Where did you get that?
-We have no time, Lydia. Let's go.


36
00:05:13.089 --> 00:05:15.550
No, I can't go.

37
00:05:16.259 --> 00:05:19.179
Trust me. Everything will be all right.

38
00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:22.432
-That man is our only way out.
-Javier will kill us both.


39
00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:28.771
I will come back for you. I promise.

40
00:05:32.734 --> 00:05:36.488
Get into bed.
Pretend you've been sleeping.


41
00:05:41.951 --> 00:05:44.412
You've made your point clear.

42
00:05:45.205 --> 00:05:47.499
I wasn't trying to make any point, Javier.

43
00:05:48.082 --> 00:05:52.212
Okay, shit. Three million.

44
00:05:52.253 --> 00:05:53.922
Do you accept the offer?

45
00:05:55.965 --> 00:05:59.344
Three and a half. 
My price just went up.

46
00:06:01.763 --> 00:06:03.097
Asshole.

47
00:06:04.891 --> 00:06:06.184
Okay.

48
00:06:10.271 --> 00:06:12.941
But only if you do
it in less than a week.

49
00:06:22.450 --> 00:06:24.410
You'll hear from me
when the job is done.

50
00:07:04.075 --> 00:07:05.201
Drive.

51
00:07:06.453 --> 00:07:07.871
Get me out of here.

52
00:07:08.621 --> 00:07:09.831
Now.

53
00:07:32.270 --> 00:07:33.313
What's your name?

54
00:07:35.857 --> 00:07:39.903
My name is Sarai. Javier has had me
in captivity since I was fourteen.


55
00:07:40.945 --> 00:07:42.113
I need you to help me.

56
00:07:44.824 --> 00:07:46.701
Why do you think I'll help you?

57
00:07:47.452 --> 00:07:48.411
Why not?

58
00:07:50.330 --> 00:07:52.165
Interfering is not my business.

59
00:07:52.207 --> 00:07:53.249
What's your business then?

60
00:07:54.042 --> 00:07:55.376
Killing people in cold blood?

61
00:08:01.508 --> 00:08:02.884
Can you take me to the border?

62
00:08:04.135 --> 00:08:07.096
I'll do whatever you want.
Please, help me cross the border.


63
00:08:07.138 --> 00:08:08.932
If you mean the US border,

64
00:08:08.973 --> 00:08:11.434
you must know that the distance is longer
than I care to have you in my car.


65
00:08:11.476 --> 00:08:12.811
How long is that?

66
00:08:15.647 --> 00:08:17.315
Can you tell me where we are?

67
00:08:22.779 --> 00:08:23.696
Okay.

68
00:08:25.240 --> 00:08:27.492
If you aren't helping me, stop the car.
I'll go on my own.


69
00:08:36.459 --> 00:08:38.628
Sarai, get up.
Javier wants to see you.


70
00:08:40.839 --> 00:08:43.133
I'm talking to you, stupid girl.

71
00:08:44.217 --> 00:08:46.803
-Where is Sarai?
-I don't know.


72
00:08:46.845 --> 00:08:48.388
How is it that you don't know?

73
00:08:56.563 --> 00:08:57.814
I'm different from the others.

74
00:08:59.274 --> 00:09:00.775
I'm Javier's favorite.

75
00:09:02.152 --> 00:09:04.320
You can use me as leverage.

76
00:09:04.362 --> 00:09:06.072
What makes you think I need leverage?

77
00:09:06.990 --> 00:09:09.033
Did he pay you the whole $3.5 million?

78
00:09:10.827 --> 00:09:12.620
That's not how it works.

79
00:09:12.662 --> 00:09:14.414
I know how Javier works.

80
00:09:14.456 --> 00:09:16.749
If he didn't give you all the money before
you left, he will never pay you.


81
00:09:17.333 --> 00:09:21.004
-He'd rather die than to pay you.
-Are you getting out?


82
00:09:25.008 --> 00:09:27.510
No. You're taking me to the border.

83
00:09:43.151 --> 00:09:45.028
Javier, Sarai is gone.

84
00:09:45.069 --> 00:09:47.989
I looked everywhere for her.
Let's call that son of a bitch.


85
00:09:48.031 --> 00:09:49.157
She must have gone with him.

86
00:09:50.366 --> 00:09:52.452
Javier, are you listening to me?
I'm talking to you.


87
00:09:52.494 --> 00:09:56.164
Sarai is gone.
Hurry up, they can't have gone too far.


88
00:10:10.512 --> 00:10:12.222
Why are you his favorite?

89
00:10:15.016 --> 00:10:16.434
I was not purchased.

90
00:10:17.811 --> 00:10:19.354
I was brought here by my mother.

91
00:10:21.397 --> 00:10:23.733
Javier saw something different in me
from the rest.


92
00:10:25.193 --> 00:10:30.240
He calls it love.
I call it sick obsession.


93
00:10:31.658 --> 00:10:33.952
I just want to go back home.

94
00:10:33.993 --> 00:10:36.162
I can pay you. 
I will find a way.

95
00:10:37.914 --> 00:10:39.332
I do what I say.

96
00:10:40.583 --> 00:10:45.588
I'm not going to hide.
And with time, I will pay you.


97
00:10:46.214 --> 00:10:49.759
If a drug lord believes
he is in love with you,


98
00:10:49.801 --> 00:10:52.220
it would not be me
you will need to hide from.


99
00:10:52.262 --> 00:10:56.307
-Then you know I am in danger.
-But you are not my responsibility.


100
00:10:58.935 --> 00:11:01.813
If you had a daughter or a sister,
you would care.


101
00:11:03.106 --> 00:11:05.525
I had a life before my mother
brought me from Spain.


102
00:11:06.067 --> 00:11:07.610
It wasn't much, but...

103
00:11:08.153 --> 00:11:09.654
I had one.

104
00:11:57.035 --> 00:11:58.369
What are you doing?

105
00:12:01.080 --> 00:12:01.956
Don't kill me.

106
00:12:02.457 --> 00:12:03.458
Don't move.

107
00:12:11.966 --> 00:12:13.885
Don't talk or raise your head.

108
00:12:20.266 --> 00:12:21.559
Where is Sarai?

109
00:12:22.602 --> 00:12:23.770
It's him.

110
00:12:23.812 --> 00:12:26.981
Javier wants to know why the hell
you didn't bring her back yourself.


111
00:12:28.817 --> 00:12:30.026
Sit down.

112
00:12:30.068 --> 00:12:32.237
No. I didn't come here to visit you.

113
00:12:32.821 --> 00:12:33.988
Bring me Sarai.

114
00:12:36.491 --> 00:12:39.744
Or you and I can be alone together
for a while first.


115
00:12:41.079 --> 00:12:42.247
Wouldn't you like that?

116
00:12:48.002 --> 00:12:50.964
-You'd rather shoot me than have sex with
me? -Yes, I would rather.


117
00:12:52.382 --> 00:12:53.383
Bring Sarai out here.

118
00:13:01.099 --> 00:13:02.350
I've told you to have a seat.

119
00:13:49.230 --> 00:13:50.482
You're going to tell me

120
00:13:51.858 --> 00:13:54.319
the real objective
behind Javier hiring me.


121
00:13:55.904 --> 00:13:57.489
What do you mean?

122
00:13:59.741 --> 00:14:03.286
If he wanted me alive to kill Guzman,
none of his men would have fired at me.


123
00:14:04.537 --> 00:14:06.706
Javier wants Guzman dead.

124
00:14:06.748 --> 00:14:08.708
Otherwise he wouldn't have
let you leave with the money.


125
00:14:18.384 --> 00:14:22.597
If I kill Guzman, I will have no problem
getting the rest of the money.


126
00:14:23.723 --> 00:14:24.724
Exactly.

127
00:14:25.683 --> 00:14:27.185
Did she already get in your head?

128
00:14:29.103 --> 00:14:31.147
That girl wasn't bought or sold.

129
00:14:31.189 --> 00:14:34.234
-I didn't ask you.
-You didn't need to.


130
00:14:38.905 --> 00:14:40.365
I see. You're going to play the hero.

131
00:14:45.703 --> 00:14:47.747
She will be my payment guarantee.

132
00:14:48.998 --> 00:14:52.168
Javier won't like that.
The girl wasn't part of the deal.


133
00:14:55.213 --> 00:14:59.175
I don't care what Javier thinks.

134
00:14:59.217 --> 00:15:01.803
Go and tell him that from now on
there will be a new deal.


135
00:15:02.762 --> 00:15:08.184
I'll keep the girl until I kill Guzman,
then we exchange the girl for my money.


136
00:15:09.936 --> 00:15:12.063
You aren't understanding
anything, asshole.


137
00:15:13.356 --> 00:15:19.237
If you want a whore, Javier can give you
anyone you want, but not that girl.


138
00:15:20.697 --> 00:15:24.868
You are going to wake the monster.
I doubt you want that.


139
00:15:30.081 --> 00:15:32.333
Put your hands behind the chair.

140
00:15:34.127 --> 00:15:35.670
Go to hell.

141
00:15:50.810 --> 00:15:52.061
Asshole!

142
00:15:53.605 --> 00:15:55.565
Put your hands behind the chair.

143
00:16:04.199 --> 00:16:07.118
Sarai, come out of the bathroom.

144
00:16:17.712 --> 00:16:19.297
Come here.

145
00:16:19.339 --> 00:16:21.925
Didn't you tell him that Javier
has you anytime he wants?


146
00:16:29.015 --> 00:16:30.725
Don't feel sorry for her.

147
00:16:31.643 --> 00:16:34.562
He treats this whore better than me,
and I'm his sister.


148
00:16:35.146 --> 00:16:36.439
Doesn't he?

149
00:16:38.983 --> 00:16:41.194
There is a rope
in the bag. Take it.

150
00:16:48.326 --> 00:16:49.494
Tie her up.

151
00:16:53.456 --> 00:16:55.250
Lydia asked about you.

152
00:16:56.501 --> 00:17:00.672
She is going to be punished.
But you knew that, didn't you, Sarai?


153
00:17:02.549 --> 00:17:06.803
I don't care what they do to her.
I won't go back there.


154
00:17:08.054 --> 00:17:09.806
Be careful.

155
00:17:12.016 --> 00:17:15.103
Good. Get away from her.

156
00:17:20.275 --> 00:17:22.360
Tell Javier I will be in touch.

157
00:17:24.529 --> 00:17:25.738
Let's go.

158
00:17:27.699 --> 00:17:33.705
Son of a bitch, you're dead.
You hear me? Dead!


159
00:18:34.557 --> 00:18:36.142
Will you tell me your name?

160
00:18:38.520 --> 00:18:39.479
Victor.

161
00:18:43.441 --> 00:18:44.776
Where are you from, Victor?

162
00:18:46.778 --> 00:18:47.987
Finish eating.

163
00:18:56.371 --> 00:18:58.373
You know my name and where I'm from.

164
00:19:00.125 --> 00:19:01.501
Why don't you want to talk to me?

165
00:19:02.794 --> 00:19:04.921
At least tell me where you're from.

166
00:19:14.347 --> 00:19:15.765
I was born in Cuba.

167
00:19:17.600 --> 00:19:19.561
I have a younger sister.

168
00:19:19.602 --> 00:19:23.106
-My mother is Mexican, father was
Cuban. -Was?


169
00:19:23.857 --> 00:19:27.026
He is dead. He was my first kill.

170
00:19:32.115 --> 00:19:33.366
You killed your father?

171
00:19:35.118 --> 00:19:38.496
-Why?
-I think you know enough about me.


172
00:19:45.211 --> 00:19:47.255
I need to go to the bathroom.

173
00:19:51.259 --> 00:19:56.097
-I'm not going to the bathroom with you.
-You go with me or you don't go.


174
00:20:44.479 --> 00:20:46.064
Don't come out.

175
00:21:59.971 --> 00:22:01.055
What happened?

176
00:22:02.557 --> 00:22:03.850
They were coming for you.

177
00:22:06.728 --> 00:22:07.645
Let's go.

178
00:22:11.608 --> 00:22:12.775
You want a new car?

179
00:22:50.188 --> 00:22:51.856
They're all dead.

180
00:22:53.358 --> 00:22:56.319
That little bitch. 
And what do we do now?

181
00:22:59.197 --> 00:23:00.657
Lydia.

182
00:23:18.842 --> 00:23:20.635
What is this place?

183
00:23:22.512 --> 00:23:24.639
We're spending the night here.

184
00:23:25.473 --> 00:23:26.683
It's a secure place.

185
00:23:27.684 --> 00:23:31.229
If you want, you can take a shower.

186
00:23:37.235 --> 00:23:38.445
Victor...

187
00:23:41.239 --> 00:23:42.907
Please, don't call me by my name.

188
00:23:46.786 --> 00:23:47.996
Forget it.

189
00:24:32.373 --> 00:24:35.418
Can you tell me what you did?
The girl wasn't part of the deal.


190
00:24:35.460 --> 00:24:37.295
Guzman's daughter was in the house.

191
00:24:42.091 --> 00:24:44.552
-Are you sure it was her?
-I'm sure.


192
00:24:45.220 --> 00:24:46.638
I talked to Javier.

193
00:24:47.222 --> 00:24:51.100
I negotiated with him and accepted
half of the money, as you asked me.


194
00:24:51.142 --> 00:24:53.353
What did Javier offer you to kill Guzman?

195
00:24:53.394 --> 00:24:57.315
Less than what Guzman offered to kill
Javier and recover his daughter.


196
00:24:57.357 --> 00:25:01.027
Everything has changed, the plan,
the contract, your orders, everything.


197
00:25:01.528 --> 00:25:03.655
What are my new orders?

198
00:25:04.322 --> 00:25:05.865
He is waiting for me to contact him.

199
00:25:05.907 --> 00:25:09.160
Your new orders depend
on the information you have.


200
00:25:09.702 --> 00:25:12.163
The girl is useful, Niklas.

201
00:25:12.664 --> 00:25:13.915
She's important to Javier.

202
00:25:13.957 --> 00:25:18.461
-Exchange her for Guzman's daughter?
-If necessary.


203
00:25:18.503 --> 00:25:20.839
Go and tell Vonnegut

204
00:25:21.840 --> 00:25:23.216
that everything is under control.

205
00:25:23.258 --> 00:25:26.678
I will tell him.
Javier sent something for you to see.


206
00:25:41.192 --> 00:25:42.444
What were you watching?

207
00:25:45.989 --> 00:25:47.073
Turn around.

208
00:25:47.615 --> 00:25:48.658
Why?

209
00:25:49.868 --> 00:25:52.912
No. Victor, please.

210
00:25:52.954 --> 00:25:55.206
-Stop it, Victor.
-Sorry.


211
00:25:58.168 --> 00:25:59.377
Victor, don't do this.

212
00:26:20.064 --> 00:26:20.982
Rest.

213
00:27:15.453 --> 00:27:16.663
What's the password?

214
00:27:18.665 --> 00:27:21.459
-You don't want to see that.
-Give me the password.


215
00:27:26.673 --> 00:27:32.679
68k30

216
00:27:33.429 --> 00:27:37.392
5Lw

217
00:27:37.433 --> 00:27:40.103
65.

218
00:27:40.145 --> 00:27:43.356
I'll tell you one more time,
you don't want to see that.


219
00:27:43.898 --> 00:27:47.652
For you, Sarai, if you don't come back,
say goodbye to your friend.


220
00:28:03.126 --> 00:28:04.836
-Leave me alone.
-Shut up.


221
00:28:10.884 --> 00:28:13.011
Shut up.

222
00:28:13.845 --> 00:28:15.138
Javier, there.

223
00:29:02.185 --> 00:29:05.772
-Niklas.
-Javier is on the phone. Can you talk?


224
00:29:06.564 --> 00:29:07.565
Yes.

225
00:29:10.401 --> 00:29:12.821
You are going to die
for what you've done.


226
00:29:12.862 --> 00:29:15.240
Sarai should have been returned to me
the minute you found her.


227
00:29:15.740 --> 00:29:18.368
What's done is done.
Why did you call me?


228
00:29:18.409 --> 00:29:21.663
I want Guzman dead
for the price we agreed.


229
00:29:22.622 --> 00:29:26.042
But I'll give you one million more
if you kill Sarai.


230
00:29:29.254 --> 00:29:33.508
-Why do you want her dead?
-As we've already discussed,


231
00:29:33.550 --> 00:29:36.928
-reasons don't matter in this business.
-Okay.


232
00:29:37.637 --> 00:29:39.139
Then this is what will happen:

233
00:29:39.889 --> 00:29:42.851
You're going to bring me
Guzman's daughter for Sarai.


234
00:29:42.892 --> 00:29:45.728
Then I kill Guzman and give
the girl back when you pay me.


235
00:29:46.437 --> 00:29:48.982
-Guzman's daughter?
-Yes.


236
00:29:49.607 --> 00:29:54.237
And I thought all this time
that he wanted to kill me. You're good.


237
00:29:54.279 --> 00:29:56.906
You're doing two contracts
at the same time.


238
00:29:56.948 --> 00:29:58.783
You show the daughter to Guzman,

239
00:29:58.825 --> 00:30:01.202
you take the money that he offered
to pay you to recover his daughter,


240
00:30:01.244 --> 00:30:05.039
you kill him and then get the money
I offered you for his head.


241
00:30:05.081 --> 00:30:06.708
Is it a deal or not?

242
00:30:07.459 --> 00:30:09.878
Then you're not killing Sarai.

243
00:30:10.628 --> 00:30:12.088
Not for now.

244
00:30:12.130 --> 00:30:13.423
She's my only guarantee.

245
00:30:14.215 --> 00:30:16.509
Once I give her back to you,
you can do whatever you want.


246
00:30:17.635 --> 00:30:21.723
Okay. I'll arrange for everything
to happen today.


247
00:30:38.198 --> 00:30:41.117
Wake up. We're going.

248
00:30:41.910 --> 00:30:44.496
-Are you taking me to Lydia?
-Not for now.


249
00:30:47.540 --> 00:30:49.876
I don't care what happens to me.
You have to take me back.


250
00:30:50.502 --> 00:30:52.295
I don't think it's
the best thing for you.

251
00:30:53.338 --> 00:30:56.132
You have to take me there, Victor.
They are going to kill her.


252
00:30:56.174 --> 00:30:57.383
Sarai, the plan has changed.

253
00:30:57.425 --> 00:30:59.219
No. Can't you understand?

254
00:30:59.260 --> 00:31:01.346
You have to take me.
I'm the only one who can help her.


255
00:31:07.560 --> 00:31:10.605
-I'm going with or without you.
-I decide when you're going.


256
00:31:12.273 --> 00:31:13.107
Get dressed.

257
00:31:13.900 --> 00:31:15.151
Aren't you going to tie me up?

258
00:31:16.653 --> 00:31:17.821
What happens if I escape?

259
00:31:19.364 --> 00:31:21.533
The only one who knows
the way back to Javier is me.


260
00:31:22.367 --> 00:31:24.536
Are you coming or staying?

261
00:32:04.826 --> 00:32:06.703
Why does Javier want you dead?

262
00:32:08.538 --> 00:32:09.539
What?

263
00:32:10.957 --> 00:32:12.709
Did he say he wanted to kill me?

264
00:32:13.918 --> 00:32:15.962
He offered me one million to do it.

265
00:32:19.591 --> 00:32:20.550
Why?

266
00:32:26.389 --> 00:32:27.515
No.

267
00:32:28.183 --> 00:32:30.101
-I don't know.
-Yes, you know.


268
00:32:31.686 --> 00:32:32.562
Think.

269
00:32:40.945 --> 00:32:44.991
I don't know, Victor. 
I don't understand.

270
00:32:46.451 --> 00:32:48.453
I always knew he was crazy

271
00:32:48.495 --> 00:32:51.581
and obsessed with me.

272
00:32:52.791 --> 00:32:57.462
And he protected me from everything
that was done to the other girls.


273
00:32:57.504 --> 00:32:59.464
He protected you?

274
00:32:59.506 --> 00:33:03.843
Yes. He didn't let his men touch me,

275
00:33:04.427 --> 00:33:06.137
not even his sister.

276
00:33:07.722 --> 00:33:13.353
He never left me alone. When he flew
somewhere he took me with him.


277
00:33:14.270 --> 00:33:16.105
And I felt...

278
00:33:17.315 --> 00:33:21.236
-like a trophy.
-That's exactly what you are.


279
00:33:22.195 --> 00:33:23.947
Where did he take you?

280
00:33:25.198 --> 00:33:29.619
They seemed like vacation houses.

281
00:33:29.661 --> 00:33:32.831
He said he was going
to meet with people,


282
00:33:32.872 --> 00:33:37.085
but I knew about the drugs
and the women.


283
00:33:37.669 --> 00:33:42.757
-Sometimes we came back with a new
girl. -Do you remember any names?


284
00:33:46.553 --> 00:33:49.347
No, not at the moment.

285
00:33:54.686 --> 00:33:55.770
What happened?

286
00:34:00.441 --> 00:34:01.985
You know too much.

287
00:34:03.987 --> 00:34:07.907
If you're alive and free,
then you're a threat to Javier


288
00:34:07.949 --> 00:34:09.742
and to his whole organization.

289
00:34:15.373 --> 00:34:16.708
Are you going to kill me?

290
00:34:20.336 --> 00:34:22.881
If that had been my intention,
I would have killed you already.


291
00:34:24.174 --> 00:34:27.969
Why don't you do it?
Because I'm your guarantee?


292
00:34:28.011 --> 00:34:29.345
In a way, yes.

293
00:34:30.847 --> 00:34:32.682
But I don't kill innocent people.

294
00:34:38.354 --> 00:34:39.689
I am not innocent.

295
00:34:41.483 --> 00:34:43.026
Nobody is innocent.

296
00:34:45.737 --> 00:34:48.198
I let that asshole rape me for years.

297
00:34:49.032 --> 00:34:50.241
I've never done anything.

298
00:34:51.159 --> 00:34:52.035
I just stood there.

299
00:34:53.077 --> 00:34:57.707
Seeing everything. Seeing how his men
and his whore of a sister...


300
00:34:58.374 --> 00:34:59.250
rape,

301
00:35:00.168 --> 00:35:03.338
torture, and sell the girls.

302
00:35:06.466 --> 00:35:07.759
Like Carmen.

303
00:35:08.843 --> 00:35:11.095
They broke her hands...

304
00:35:11.137 --> 00:35:12.514
with a hammer.

305
00:35:13.056 --> 00:35:14.682
Marisol...

306
00:35:16.309 --> 00:35:17.852
They made her have an abortion

307
00:35:18.478 --> 00:35:20.522
and let her bleed to death...

308
00:35:21.064 --> 00:35:23.983
on the stretcher,
with her baby by her side.


309
00:35:24.567 --> 00:35:27.946
Karen was killed because

310
00:35:28.905 --> 00:35:32.951
the man who went
to buy her didn't like her.


311
00:35:34.828 --> 00:35:39.833
And I was standing there,
without doing anything.


312
00:35:40.959 --> 00:35:44.045
Never. I never did anything.

313
00:35:46.714 --> 00:35:48.133
Yes, you did.

314
00:35:49.342 --> 00:35:52.053
Despite everything you went through,
you kept calm.


315
00:35:53.179 --> 00:35:54.973
And waited for your opportunity.

316
00:35:57.642 --> 00:36:00.186
And today you're risking
your life for your friend.


317
00:36:01.563 --> 00:36:03.064
You're innocent.

318
00:36:05.191 --> 00:36:07.026
If not, you wouldn't be alive.

319
00:36:15.285 --> 00:36:16.369
Don't move.

320
00:36:26.296 --> 00:36:27.672
Everything is prepared.

321
00:36:28.173 --> 00:36:29.799
Can you tell me what you're doing?

322
00:36:30.550 --> 00:36:33.219
-These negotiations...
-What are the new orders?


323
00:36:37.098 --> 00:36:37.974
Nothing yet.

324
00:36:38.892 --> 00:36:41.144
But you can't accept deals by yourself.

325
00:36:42.187 --> 00:36:45.857
-You can only execute them.
-Vonnegut must trust me.


326
00:36:48.693 --> 00:36:50.445
Can you do me a favor?

327
00:36:52.280 --> 00:36:53.323
As a brother?

328
00:36:54.657 --> 00:36:56.034
Not as my contact.

329
00:36:58.244 --> 00:36:59.204
Have I ever said no?

330
00:37:11.883 --> 00:37:13.510
Sarai, this is Niklas.

331
00:37:14.844 --> 00:37:16.721
You are going with him in his car.

332
00:37:20.308 --> 00:37:21.226
Easy.

333
00:37:21.851 --> 00:37:23.019
He won't hurt you.

334
00:37:31.694 --> 00:37:33.154
What's going to happen now?

335
00:37:34.155 --> 00:37:35.990
We are going to meet Javier.

336
00:37:36.825 --> 00:37:38.326
He is going to
give your friend to us.

337
00:37:39.494 --> 00:37:41.037
Are you going to exchange me for Lydia?

338
00:37:41.079 --> 00:37:42.372
That was the deal.

339
00:37:45.875 --> 00:37:47.502
If that's what I have
to do, I'll do it.

340
00:37:52.257 --> 00:37:56.136
Promise me nothing
is going to happen to Lydia.


341
00:38:41.139 --> 00:38:43.183
You're a complete distraction.

342
00:38:45.810 --> 00:38:48.271
I never wanted to cause trouble,
not for you nor Victor.


343
00:38:49.939 --> 00:38:55.195
I want to be clear, everything Victor does
is for the sake of The Order.


344
00:38:57.113 --> 00:38:58.156
Not for you.

345
00:39:19.093 --> 00:39:21.262
Javier didn't come. How cowardly.

346
00:39:22.388 --> 00:39:26.392
He is not a coward, he is very clever.
Please, hide.


347
00:39:59.551 --> 00:40:02.637
-And Javier?
-He is not coming.


348
00:40:20.405 --> 00:40:23.950
-It's her, Lydia! She's there!
-I told you to stay down.


349
00:40:28.830 --> 00:40:30.165
I said two.

350
00:40:43.052 --> 00:40:44.137
Cordelia.

351
00:40:44.721 --> 00:40:46.014
What is she doing here?

352
00:42:49.095 --> 00:42:49.971
I'm sorry.

353
00:42:50.972 --> 00:42:53.099
Look at me.

354
00:42:53.141 --> 00:42:54.142
Everything will be all right.

355
00:43:57.622 --> 00:43:58.915
What the hell did you do?

356
00:44:00.125 --> 00:44:01.417
You're risking everything.

357
00:44:02.210 --> 00:44:03.503
Everything. Your place in The Order.

358
00:44:03.545 --> 00:44:05.880
Your relationship with Vonnegut.
Your life. My life!


359
00:44:05.922 --> 00:44:07.382
You've become unstable, Victor.

360
00:44:07.882 --> 00:44:10.802
And you know better than anyone
what The Order does in these cases.


361
00:44:11.886 --> 00:44:13.972
You are going to tell Vonnegut
that they shot first.


362
00:44:14.764 --> 00:44:17.517
And you're going to inform Guzman that
we had no control over Javier's absence,


363
00:44:17.559 --> 00:44:19.144
but the job will be done.

364
00:44:23.398 --> 00:44:25.483
As usual, I'll tell him
whatever you need me to say.


365
00:44:26.401 --> 00:44:27.569
Just tell me something.

366
00:44:29.195 --> 00:44:31.239
Does this have anything to do with
what happened in Budapest?


367
00:44:33.533 --> 00:44:34.451
I have nothing to say about that.

368
00:45:11.196 --> 00:45:12.822
Is everything I asked for ready?

369
00:45:12.864 --> 00:45:15.074
Everything's ready.
They're waiting for you.


370
00:45:39.766 --> 00:45:41.100
Go to the bathroom and wash your face.

371
00:46:35.447 --> 00:46:37.157
From now on you're Izabel.

372
00:46:38.199 --> 00:46:39.576
What?

373
00:46:39.617 --> 00:46:42.287
We're going to a safe house,
but nobody can know your name.


374
00:46:42.787 --> 00:46:44.664
Not even the woman who is receiving us.

375
00:46:46.458 --> 00:46:47.750
Who is the woman?

376
00:46:48.626 --> 00:46:50.044
She is a safe contact.

377
00:46:51.212 --> 00:46:54.924
-If she is one of you, why lie to her?
-To be cautious.


378
00:46:55.467 --> 00:46:59.012
When a person is sought by powerful
people, anyone can be influenced.


379
00:48:03.284 --> 00:48:05.245
Are you sharing the same bed?

380
00:48:05.286 --> 00:48:07.831
Because I can make one on the sofa,
for either of you.


381
00:48:07.872 --> 00:48:10.125
It won't be necessary,
I'm not sleeping here.


382
00:48:11.459 --> 00:48:13.670
Make yourself at home then.

383
00:48:14.254 --> 00:48:15.421
Victor...

384
00:48:16.005 --> 00:48:17.257
you know where to find me.

385
00:48:21.052 --> 00:48:22.929
Why are we here?

386
00:48:22.971 --> 00:48:25.056
You're staying here
until I eliminate Javier.


387
00:48:28.726 --> 00:48:29.978
I prefer to go with you.

388
00:48:30.812 --> 00:48:31.855
No, Sarai.

389
00:48:33.565 --> 00:48:34.858
You're staying here.

390
00:48:37.735 --> 00:48:39.737
It's not necessary for you
to keep risking your life.


391
00:48:41.448 --> 00:48:44.284
If you want to be more comfortable,
there are new clothes in the closet.


392
00:48:44.325 --> 00:48:45.368
They should be your size.

393
00:49:02.427 --> 00:49:03.928
Trust me.

394
00:49:06.139 --> 00:49:07.765
Javier is going to kill both of us.

395
00:49:35.585 --> 00:49:37.587
-Ready.
-Thanks.


396
00:49:38.755 --> 00:49:42.091
That girl you brought, Izabel?

397
00:49:42.133 --> 00:49:44.677
We both know it's not
her real name of course.


398
00:49:45.720 --> 00:49:46.763
What are you doing with her?

399
00:49:47.639 --> 00:49:51.434
I'm using her until I eliminate Javier.
After that she will be free.


400
00:49:53.394 --> 00:49:57.065
I don't think it's only that.
Are you looking to be exiled?


401
00:49:57.607 --> 00:49:58.858
To be killed?

402
00:50:00.401 --> 00:50:01.486
Or both?

403
00:50:31.808 --> 00:50:32.725
Are you leaving?

404
00:50:34.727 --> 00:50:35.603
Yes.

405
00:50:37.313 --> 00:50:38.439
Are you coming back?

406
00:50:39.983 --> 00:50:41.359
Maybe. I don't know.

407
00:50:42.777 --> 00:50:45.363
Once I kill Javier, Samantha will take you
wherever you need to go.


408
00:50:45.905 --> 00:50:47.198
Or I'll send Niklas for you.

409
00:50:48.741 --> 00:50:50.452
And if others know?

410
00:50:51.494 --> 00:50:53.955
Maybe Javier is not the only one
who can find me.


411
00:51:21.024 --> 00:51:21.941
Victor.

412
00:51:25.904 --> 00:51:27.238
I'm afraid I won't see you again.

413
00:51:48.259 --> 00:51:49.135
Niklas.

414
00:51:58.686 --> 00:51:59.562
What time?

415
00:52:10.907 --> 00:52:11.741
Good morning.

416
00:52:12.242 --> 00:52:13.952
Do you drink coffee?

417
00:52:14.619 --> 00:52:15.495
Yes, please.

418
00:52:17.872 --> 00:52:21.251
I'm sure he knows you
appreciate his help.


419
00:52:22.961 --> 00:52:24.254
Can you tell me anything about him?

420
00:52:26.881 --> 00:52:28.591
I only know what he told me.

421
00:52:30.009 --> 00:52:30.969
And what was that?

422
00:52:32.512 --> 00:52:35.557
Not much. Nobody
knows much about him.


423
00:52:36.599 --> 00:52:40.353
I suppose it's okay if I tell you
that he is a discreet and strange man.


424
00:52:41.813 --> 00:52:43.606
That he likes Cuban coffee.

425
00:52:44.232 --> 00:52:45.733
Mexican food.

426
00:52:46.484 --> 00:52:47.485
How long has he been like that?

427
00:52:49.154 --> 00:52:50.113
Always.

428
00:52:52.240 --> 00:52:56.453
When he was little he was raised
by assassins and trained to be one.


429
00:52:57.537 --> 00:52:59.122
He doesn't trust anything or anyone.

430
00:53:00.123 --> 00:53:01.583
Everything he does is planned.

431
00:53:02.500 --> 00:53:03.793
Nothing is accidental.

432
00:53:07.464 --> 00:53:09.632
He told me he killed his father.

433
00:53:11.134 --> 00:53:12.010
Is that true?

434
00:53:13.303 --> 00:53:15.763
If he told you that, it must have been
to shut you up.


435
00:53:31.196 --> 00:53:32.530
What are you doing?
Come here.


436
00:53:33.364 --> 00:53:34.449
Quickly.

437
00:53:55.345 --> 00:53:57.305
I have four bullets in this gun.

438
00:53:57.680 --> 00:53:59.682
I'm going to put one in you
every two minutes


439
00:54:00.016 --> 00:54:01.351
if Sarai does not appear.

440
00:54:01.392 --> 00:54:02.560
Victor is coming.

441
00:54:03.978 --> 00:54:04.979
You're lying.

442
00:54:05.563 --> 00:54:07.357
You reek of lies.

443
00:54:09.442 --> 00:54:10.568
Search the house.

444
00:54:11.069 --> 00:54:12.362
Find her.

445
00:54:18.326 --> 00:54:19.452
Victor was here.

446
00:54:19.911 --> 00:54:21.329
With a girl named Izabel.

447
00:54:22.539 --> 00:54:23.748
But he took her with him.

448
00:54:34.884 --> 00:54:36.636
I know she is here.

449
00:54:37.512 --> 00:54:40.765
I know she didn't go with him.
I've been watching him.


450
00:54:42.600 --> 00:54:45.478
So, you have six minutes,
because the last bullet...


451
00:54:46.020 --> 00:54:47.647
is for your head.

452
00:54:50.859 --> 00:54:52.861
Are you listening, Sarai?

453
00:54:54.571 --> 00:54:58.366
In six more minutes, you'll kill her.
The same you did with Lydia.


454
00:54:59.993 --> 00:55:02.454
I just want to take you home, honey.

455
00:55:03.204 --> 00:55:04.539
I will never hurt you.

456
00:55:08.084 --> 00:55:10.003
I told you nobody is here.

457
00:55:19.053 --> 00:55:20.096
Son of a bitch.

458
00:55:21.890 --> 00:55:24.267
Time is running out, Sarai.

459
00:55:35.987 --> 00:55:37.030
Samantha.

460
00:55:37.071 --> 00:55:39.449
-Are you okay?
-Come here.


461
00:55:39.491 --> 00:55:40.533
What happened?

462
00:55:40.575 --> 00:55:41.826
Aren't you happy?

463
00:55:42.410 --> 00:55:46.206
Why didn't you tell me?
I would have done anything for you.


464
00:55:48.750 --> 00:55:49.959
Let me have a look at you.

465
00:55:53.546 --> 00:55:55.256
Did you have sex with him?

466
00:55:56.466 --> 00:55:57.592
Did you sleep with him?

467
00:55:59.052 --> 00:56:00.553
Or are you still mine?

468
00:56:02.972 --> 00:56:04.182
I'll always...

469
00:56:04.224 --> 00:56:05.433
be yours.

470
00:56:06.851 --> 00:56:09.813
Don't lie.
You know what you've done to me?


471
00:56:10.230 --> 00:56:13.817
-You shouldn't have gone.
-I'm ready to come home.


472
00:56:24.619 --> 00:56:25.745
Did you kill her?

473
00:56:28.540 --> 00:56:29.707
That's right.

474
00:56:41.177 --> 00:56:42.387
There is your boyfriend.

475
00:57:22.010 --> 00:57:22.886
Sarai.

476
00:57:26.973 --> 00:57:27.849
We have to go.

477
00:57:29.976 --> 00:57:31.102
You're going to be okay.

478
00:57:32.770 --> 00:57:33.646
Let's go.

479
00:57:34.647 --> 00:57:35.648
Come on.

480
00:58:26.157 --> 00:58:28.034
I haven't seen you
in a church in years.

481
00:58:30.954 --> 00:58:32.914
Do you think God will forgive you
for everything you've done?


482
00:58:40.213 --> 00:58:41.381
I didn't come to ask for forgiveness.

483
00:58:43.049 --> 00:58:44.175
Then?

484
00:58:44.759 --> 00:58:45.760
What are we doing here?

485
00:58:46.261 --> 00:58:47.428
Have a seat.

486
00:58:48.388 --> 00:58:49.264
We have to talk.

487
00:58:58.022 --> 00:58:59.732
Do you remember the
mission in Budapest?


488
00:59:02.026 --> 00:59:03.111
It never existed.

489
00:59:05.905 --> 00:59:07.115
I went to see our father.

490
00:59:08.783 --> 00:59:09.826
He called me.

491
00:59:14.122 --> 00:59:15.206
A year ago...

492
00:59:16.666 --> 00:59:18.334
your mother was eliminated
because she was discovered


493
00:59:18.376 --> 00:59:19.627
selling information from The Order.

494
00:59:19.669 --> 00:59:21.004
But that you already know.

495
00:59:23.548 --> 00:59:25.884
The Order couldn't trust you anymore.

496
00:59:27.218 --> 00:59:30.054
Vonnegut thought you might take
revenge for her death.


497
00:59:32.932 --> 00:59:34.142
They ordered me to eliminate you.

498
00:59:37.270 --> 00:59:38.813
Our father agreed.

499
00:59:41.316 --> 00:59:42.442
Why didn't you do it?

500
00:59:46.488 --> 00:59:47.572
Why am I still alive?

501
00:59:48.072 --> 00:59:50.158
You were the only mission
I couldn't accomplish.


502
00:59:53.328 --> 00:59:55.121
Our father decided to do it himself.

503
00:59:57.457 --> 00:59:59.334
He told me the
only way to stop him

504
01:00:01.211 --> 01:00:02.462
was to kill him.

505
01:00:05.423 --> 01:00:06.758
So I shot him.

506
01:00:19.103 --> 01:00:23.107
Then I convinced Vonnegut
that he could trust you.


507
01:00:27.779 --> 01:00:29.030
Why are you telling me this now?

508
01:00:31.282 --> 01:00:32.909
You should know the truth before dying.

509
01:00:39.749 --> 01:00:40.625
What are you saying?

510
01:00:43.002 --> 01:00:44.546
Don't mess with me.

511
01:00:47.507 --> 01:00:50.969
There were only two people who knew
where we were. Samantha and you.


512
01:00:53.054 --> 01:00:54.472
What the hell are you talking about?

513
01:00:54.973 --> 01:00:56.808
Samantha gave her life for Sarai.

514
01:00:58.685 --> 01:01:00.186
You're incapable of that.

515
01:01:01.938 --> 01:01:02.981
Incapable?

516
01:01:04.941 --> 01:01:07.193
-Why did you betray me?
-I've never betrayed you.


517
01:01:07.235 --> 01:01:09.612
-Why?
-I've never betrayed you.


518
01:01:12.490 --> 01:01:14.200
I swear on my life. 
I'm your brother.

519
01:01:15.118 --> 01:01:17.579
I would die before betraying you.

520
01:01:21.416 --> 01:01:22.876
I told you not to come out.

521
01:01:24.210 --> 01:01:26.546
-You told me she was dead.
-I lied.


522
01:01:26.588 --> 01:01:28.673
Who is betraying whom?

523
01:01:30.341 --> 01:01:31.342
What?

524
01:01:33.678 --> 01:01:34.679
Kill me.

525
01:01:37.223 --> 01:01:38.516
Kill me. Please.

526
01:01:40.226 --> 01:01:41.853
I won't beg for my life.

527
01:01:43.438 --> 01:01:45.273
If you have to eliminate me, do it.

528
01:01:46.232 --> 01:01:49.486
But you must know
that I have never betrayed you.


529
01:02:05.919 --> 01:02:09.088
Victor, look at me.

530
01:02:09.798 --> 01:02:12.050
Why do you trust her?

531
01:02:12.926 --> 01:02:14.219
She was the one who started everything.

532
01:02:14.969 --> 01:02:16.721
She was the one who brought Javier.

533
01:02:18.848 --> 01:02:19.766
It was her.

534
01:02:32.779 --> 01:02:34.114
Victor, it wasn't my fault.

535
01:02:45.750 --> 01:02:46.835
Take off your clothes.

536
01:02:48.503 --> 01:02:49.379
Why?

537
01:02:50.421 --> 01:02:51.422
Take them off.

538
01:03:08.648 --> 01:03:09.607
All of it.

539
01:04:39.656 --> 01:04:40.698
What are you doing?

540
01:04:41.241 --> 01:04:42.242
Trust me.

541
01:05:12.438 --> 01:05:13.606
Don't move.

542
01:05:35.503 --> 01:05:36.588
Put your clothes on.

543
01:05:51.019 --> 01:05:52.228
Do you recognize this?

544
01:05:56.566 --> 01:05:58.359
It's the same chip
as the girls from Dubai.


545
01:05:58.943 --> 01:06:00.195
The ones Hamburg bought.

546
01:06:00.904 --> 01:06:03.406
Javier was more involved
than we thought.


547
01:06:04.449 --> 01:06:05.658
Make it disappear.

548
01:06:08.244 --> 01:06:09.120
I will.

549
01:06:42.612 --> 01:06:44.197
Start thinking where
you want me to take you.


550
01:06:45.824 --> 01:06:48.868
I have new orders arriving soon
and I won't have much time to do it.


551
01:06:50.286 --> 01:06:51.496
I want to stay with you.

552
01:06:54.124 --> 01:06:55.375
Victor, I can help you.

553
01:06:55.959 --> 01:06:57.961
Have you ever trained anyone
to be like you?


554
01:06:58.253 --> 01:06:59.170
To do what you do?

555
01:07:01.589 --> 01:07:02.841
No. And I will never do it.

556
01:07:03.842 --> 01:07:04.759
Why?

557
01:07:05.468 --> 01:07:06.427
Why not?

558
01:07:10.974 --> 01:07:12.016
I have nowhere to go.

559
01:07:13.017 --> 01:07:14.185
I don't have a family.

560
01:07:14.727 --> 01:07:15.603
No friends.

561
01:07:16.855 --> 01:07:17.981
I don't even have an identity.

562
01:07:23.027 --> 01:07:23.987
Sarai.

563
01:07:25.447 --> 01:07:26.990
You'll have everything you need.

564
01:07:28.575 --> 01:07:29.451
Money.

565
01:07:29.742 --> 01:07:31.744
A new identity. A new life.

566
01:07:31.995 --> 01:07:34.122
I will take care of that, personally.

567
01:07:34.789 --> 01:07:37.000
I don't need you to help me
with a life I don't want.


568
01:07:37.500 --> 01:07:39.127
You don't want to be alone.

569
01:07:41.337 --> 01:07:43.506
To live free and make your own decisions.

570
01:07:43.840 --> 01:07:45.467
And have sex with whom you decide.

571
01:07:45.508 --> 01:07:47.427
And have a normal life,
because you don't know that.


572
01:07:49.471 --> 01:07:52.432
If I ask you to kill someone because it's
part of a mission, you wouldn't do it.


573
01:07:53.808 --> 01:07:56.436
You couldn't kill someone without knowing
why you're doing it.


574
01:07:58.271 --> 01:07:59.564
You'll never be like me.

575
01:08:02.775 --> 01:08:03.985
We're leaving at six.

576
01:08:05.653 --> 01:08:07.530
I hope you know by then
where you want me to take you.


577
01:08:46.986 --> 01:08:48.029
You shouldn't be here.

578
01:08:48.947 --> 01:08:50.782
This is exactly where I want to be.

579
01:08:55.620 --> 01:08:56.788
Sarai.

580
01:08:57.956 --> 01:08:59.207
This cannot happen.

581
01:08:59.249 --> 01:09:00.583
Yes, it can.

582
01:09:02.001 --> 01:09:03.837
Victor, I've never been
with a man I want.

583
01:09:04.838 --> 01:09:05.964
I want to be with you.

584
01:09:07.173 --> 01:09:09.884
I want to feel what it's like
to be in control, at least just once.


585
01:11:18.138 --> 01:11:20.140
I can teach you if you want.

586
01:11:28.731 --> 01:11:29.983
Despite my fear,

587
01:11:30.483 --> 01:11:32.485
I wanted to be right where I was.

588
01:11:33.153 --> 01:11:35.155
Trapped in the arms of an assassin.

589
01:11:42.370 --> 01:11:44.205
Why didn't we leave early
like you told me?


590
01:11:47.709 --> 01:11:49.085
I thought you should rest.

591
01:11:51.129 --> 01:11:52.005
Thank you.

592
01:11:55.508 --> 01:11:56.676
You play the piano very well.

593
01:11:59.304 --> 01:12:01.097
Did you ever consider
playing professionally?


594
01:12:01.598 --> 01:12:02.849
When I was a little girl.

595
01:12:04.017 --> 01:12:05.310
But now I only play for myself.

596
01:12:07.896 --> 01:12:09.439
Can you promise me something?

597
01:12:09.856 --> 01:12:11.774
Can you play the piano for me
once in a while?


598
01:12:14.819 --> 01:12:15.820
I don't understand.

599
01:12:16.321 --> 01:12:17.322
The plane leaves in an hour.

600
01:12:18.198 --> 01:12:19.491
There's new clothes in the bags.

601
01:12:20.241 --> 01:12:21.242
Hurry up.

602
01:12:31.586 --> 01:12:33.254
Your name is Izabel Seyfried.

603
01:12:33.296 --> 01:12:35.089
You are a confident woman,

604
01:12:35.507 --> 01:12:37.425
strong, with a great personality.

605
01:12:37.884 --> 01:12:39.177
Anything I ask you,

606
01:12:39.594 --> 01:12:40.470
you do it.

607
01:12:40.720 --> 01:12:42.889
It could be the difference
between life or death.


608
01:12:43.389 --> 01:12:44.891
I'm not and I won't be your hero.

609
01:12:45.850 --> 01:12:48.102
You must understand
that you might die in this mission.


610
01:12:48.812 --> 01:12:50.230
Trust only in yourself.

611
01:12:50.563 --> 01:12:51.564
In your instinct.

612
01:12:52.023 --> 01:12:54.943
If you want, as a last resort,
you can trust me.


613
01:12:55.401 --> 01:12:57.487
I've accepted to bring
you on this mission,


614
01:12:57.529 --> 01:12:59.906
because I want to show you
that this life isn't for you.


615
01:13:03.159 --> 01:13:04.494
His name is Arthur Hamburg.

616
01:13:06.371 --> 01:13:08.915
He is known to throw
luxurious parties in different places.


617
01:13:10.083 --> 01:13:11.376
And how do we know where it is?

618
01:13:12.502 --> 01:13:13.628
We will be invited.

619
01:15:31.766 --> 01:15:33.726
Good evening. And welcome.

620
01:15:36.604 --> 01:15:37.730
Are you enjoying yourselves?

621
01:15:40.483 --> 01:15:41.734
We are.

622
01:15:42.318 --> 01:15:43.319
Thank you for the invitation.

623
01:15:44.529 --> 01:15:45.822
You speak Italian.

624
01:15:46.656 --> 01:15:47.782
I speak seven languages.

625
01:15:48.199 --> 01:15:49.075
And where...

626
01:15:50.743 --> 01:15:51.786
are you from?

627
01:15:52.495 --> 01:15:53.580
I'm not from here.

628
01:15:55.915 --> 01:15:57.167
And the lady?

629
01:15:57.208 --> 01:15:58.543
She is from Spain.

630
01:16:00.170 --> 01:16:01.379
Which part of Spain?

631
01:16:03.548 --> 01:16:04.549
Madrid.

632
01:16:05.633 --> 01:16:07.552
-And she is your--
-She is my property.


633
01:16:10.054 --> 01:16:11.306
She's mine.

634
01:16:12.974 --> 01:16:13.850
Well.

635
01:16:14.559 --> 01:16:15.894
Part of her.

636
01:16:16.394 --> 01:16:17.604
And the other part?

637
01:16:18.480 --> 01:16:20.315
The other part thinks for herself.

638
01:16:21.858 --> 01:16:23.276
I prefer a woman who resists.

639
01:16:24.778 --> 01:16:26.946
My Izabel knows how to please me.

640
01:16:28.281 --> 01:16:29.532
But sometimes,

641
01:16:30.700 --> 01:16:32.535
she can't keep her mouth shut.

642
01:16:40.043 --> 01:16:42.295
I would love to talk to you

643
01:16:42.754 --> 01:16:43.755
in a more private place.

644
01:16:45.965 --> 01:16:46.841
Okay.

645
01:16:48.551 --> 01:16:49.511
Excellent.

646
01:16:50.053 --> 01:16:51.054
Let's go.

647
01:17:30.301 --> 01:17:31.344
Check them.

648
01:17:36.724 --> 01:17:37.725
Is this necessary?

649
01:17:38.768 --> 01:17:41.062
I'm sorry, dear, 
I must be cautious.

650
01:17:42.397 --> 01:17:43.314
You can leave now.

651
01:17:44.023 --> 01:17:45.233
Come back in an hour.

652
01:17:50.071 --> 01:17:50.947
Come in.

653
01:17:51.406 --> 01:17:52.407
Make yourself at home.

654
01:18:23.605 --> 01:18:24.481
Thanks.

655
01:18:25.231 --> 01:18:26.107
You're welcome.

656
01:18:36.576 --> 01:18:37.869
I'll tell you what I want.

657
01:18:39.204 --> 01:18:41.039
And I will let you
put a price on it.

658
01:18:42.499 --> 01:18:43.708
What do you want?

659
01:18:45.710 --> 01:18:46.711
I want to watch you two.

660
01:18:49.422 --> 01:18:50.507
I want to watch you.

661
01:18:52.759 --> 01:18:53.885
Have sex with her.

662
01:18:55.220 --> 01:18:56.596
And once in a while,

663
01:18:57.305 --> 01:18:58.807
you do what I ask.

664
01:19:02.977 --> 01:19:05.021
And after that, for an extra amount...

665
01:19:07.857 --> 01:19:09.150
I kneel before you.

666
01:19:12.737 --> 01:19:13.905
I'm not doing that.

667
01:19:15.865 --> 01:19:16.741
All right.

668
01:19:19.744 --> 01:19:21.079
You're doing what I tell you.

669
01:19:26.084 --> 01:19:27.418
Fifteen thousand to watch.

670
01:19:28.294 --> 01:19:30.004
Fifteen thousand to go down on me.

671
01:19:32.632 --> 01:19:33.466
Deal.

672
01:19:35.009 --> 01:19:35.927
Cheers.

673
01:19:50.608 --> 01:19:51.484
Izabel.

674
01:19:52.777 --> 01:19:53.695
Sit down.

675
01:20:24.142 --> 01:20:25.477
Open her legs.

676
01:20:30.607 --> 01:20:31.733
Touch her.

677
01:20:48.124 --> 01:20:49.250
Make her cry.

678
01:20:50.627 --> 01:20:51.503
Come on.

679
01:20:53.963 --> 01:20:55.423
I have toys if you want.

680
01:20:57.133 --> 01:20:59.177
I don't need toys to make her cry.

681
01:21:03.890 --> 01:21:05.141
But that wouldn't be bad.

682
01:21:08.144 --> 01:21:09.562
It's been a long time
since I've made her cry like that.


683
01:21:12.690 --> 01:21:15.568
What do you think
about my wife joining us?


684
01:21:21.282 --> 01:21:22.492
That wasn't part of the deal.

685
01:21:23.993 --> 01:21:24.994
But...

686
01:21:25.787 --> 01:21:26.788
it could be.

687
01:21:28.414 --> 01:21:29.290
Where is she?

688
01:21:29.791 --> 01:21:31.417
She's right here...

689
01:21:33.378 --> 01:21:35.004
Don't get startled when
you see her.


690
01:21:37.715 --> 01:21:39.634
Somehow my Mary is like your Izabel.

691
01:21:40.844 --> 01:21:42.679
Maybe she is a little submissive...

692
01:21:44.222 --> 01:21:45.515
But you'll like her.

693
01:21:48.184 --> 01:21:49.352
Okay.

694
01:21:50.562 --> 01:21:51.437
Thank you.

695
01:22:05.535 --> 01:22:06.536
Sarai.

696
01:22:10.790 --> 01:22:13.084
In the upper drawer there's a gun
and an envelope. Take them out.


697
01:22:14.252 --> 01:22:15.253
God.

698
01:22:18.631 --> 01:22:19.632
Give me the gun.

699
01:22:23.470 --> 01:22:24.804
No, please.

700
01:22:24.846 --> 01:22:26.973
I have a lot of money, I'll give you
what you want, don't kill me.


701
01:22:27.515 --> 01:22:28.600
In the envelope,

702
01:22:29.225 --> 01:22:30.268
there is a letter, take it out.

703
01:22:32.353 --> 01:22:34.314
Your wife left a letter
signed by her hand.


704
01:22:34.355 --> 01:22:35.732
But what the hell are you saying?

705
01:22:35.773 --> 01:22:36.733
Victor, we have to help her.

706
01:22:37.150 --> 01:22:38.526
Forget about her, read the letter.

707
01:22:40.487 --> 01:22:41.321
"My dear husband,

708
01:22:41.738 --> 01:22:42.822
"I can't keep doing this,

709
01:22:42.864 --> 01:22:46.493
"I have embarrassed our family,
our children, ourselves.


710
01:22:46.951 --> 01:22:47.952
"I can't live like this any longer.

711
01:22:48.328 --> 01:22:53.333
"I'm sorry I haven't asked for your help,
but I just wanted to end everything.


712
01:22:53.374 --> 01:22:56.336
"And that's what I'm doing.
Goodbye, Arthur. Your wife, Mary."


713
01:22:58.171 --> 01:22:59.214
Tell me why you're here.

714
01:22:59.839 --> 01:23:01.883
Inside the envelope there's a memory
card. Give it to me.


715
01:23:07.013 --> 01:23:07.931
Listen to me.

716
01:23:08.556 --> 01:23:11.142
All the information here
was transferred to my boss.


717
01:23:11.684 --> 01:23:14.103
The information of your clients
and your bank accounts.


718
01:23:14.604 --> 01:23:17.190
Including videos that your wife filmed
without you knowing it.


719
01:23:17.232 --> 01:23:20.026
If you don't report this as a suicide,

720
01:23:20.568 --> 01:23:22.654
all this information
goes directly to the FBI.


721
01:23:46.636 --> 01:23:47.637
No.

722
01:23:49.722 --> 01:23:52.183
-No, please.
-Don't move.


723
01:23:53.059 --> 01:23:54.644
Please, listen to me.

724
01:23:55.436 --> 01:23:57.230
A while ago you
asked your wife to watch.

725
01:23:59.274 --> 01:24:00.942
Your wife asked you to watch this.

726
01:24:08.032 --> 01:24:09.367
Please.

727
01:24:11.494 --> 01:24:12.829
No.

728
01:24:12.871 --> 01:24:13.872
No.

729
01:24:19.627 --> 01:24:20.712
Son of a bitch.

730
01:24:41.232 --> 01:24:42.400
I'm sorry, Hamburg.

731
01:24:45.945 --> 01:24:47.322
But you have one hour...

732
01:24:49.115 --> 01:24:50.366
to create a story.

733
01:25:03.546 --> 01:25:04.506
Breathe.

734
01:25:52.512 --> 01:25:53.555
Victor Faust.

735
01:26:05.233 --> 01:26:06.484
It's been a pleasure.

736
01:26:08.945 --> 01:26:10.280
See you soon.

737
01:26:12.198 --> 01:26:13.074
Soon.

738
01:26:30.758 --> 01:26:32.677
You said you didn't kill innocent people.

739
01:26:34.220 --> 01:26:37.098
-She was innocent.
-She was the mark.


740
01:26:39.976 --> 01:26:41.644
Mary Hamburg bought her own death.

741
01:26:44.105 --> 01:26:47.275
Both were involved
in cases of violence and murders.


742
01:26:50.904 --> 01:26:52.697
A year ago,
she tried to leave everything.


743
01:26:55.742 --> 01:26:57.243
But Hamburg didn't let her.

744
01:26:59.204 --> 01:27:00.455
He made her addicted to heroin.

745
01:27:01.706 --> 01:27:03.708
And put her inside
that bedroom ever since.


746
01:27:07.754 --> 01:27:08.963
Do you think they're coming to find us?

747
01:27:11.424 --> 01:27:12.300
I don't think so.

748
01:27:14.302 --> 01:27:15.637
Hamburg has a lot to lose.

749
01:27:17.722 --> 01:27:19.474
Hamburg must pay for everything
he has done.


750
01:27:20.850 --> 01:27:22.477
As she did.

751
01:27:24.270 --> 01:27:26.231
Sooner or later,
someone will have him killed.


752
01:27:39.953 --> 01:27:42.622
If Hamburg hadn't opened
the bedroom door on time,


753
01:27:44.624 --> 01:27:46.167
would you have made love
in front of him?


754
01:27:52.674 --> 01:27:53.550
Of course not.

755
01:28:01.975 --> 01:28:03.017
But you wanted to?

756
01:28:10.775 --> 01:28:11.651
Yes.

757
01:28:12.360 --> 01:28:13.486
But not in that place.

758
01:28:14.362 --> 01:28:15.947
Not under those circumstances.

759
01:28:20.535 --> 01:28:21.619
And do you still want to?

760
01:30:28.663 --> 01:30:29.747
What happened, Niklas?

761
01:30:29.789 --> 01:30:32.792
Vonnegut has just sent you
a new mission. It's in the city.


762
01:30:32.834 --> 01:30:33.710
Place?

763
01:30:34.002 --> 01:30:37.213
I've just sent you all the information
you need. It's at 9:00.


764
01:30:38.214 --> 01:30:40.884
-That's less than an hour.
- Enough time.


765
01:30:40.925 --> 01:30:42.427
Let me know when it's done.

766
01:32:02.632 --> 01:32:03.508
Victor?

767
01:32:04.592 --> 01:32:05.969
It's Niklas. Open.

768
01:32:15.436 --> 01:32:16.646
Victor sent me for you.

769
01:32:17.438 --> 01:32:18.356
Where is he?

770
01:32:20.316 --> 01:32:21.401
He's on a mission.

771
01:32:21.442 --> 01:32:24.195
But don't worry, he will meet you
at the airport this afternoon.


772
01:32:28.199 --> 01:32:29.075
What are you doing?

773
01:32:29.534 --> 01:32:30.577
What are you doing?

774
01:32:30.618 --> 01:32:33.163
-Don't do it. I'll leave.
-I'm trying to protect my brother.


775
01:32:33.204 --> 01:32:35.498
-I know. You're right...
-They're going to kill him.


776
01:32:36.124 --> 01:32:37.625
When they find out
all he has done for you,


777
01:32:37.667 --> 01:32:38.710
it's just a matter of time.

778
01:33:40.980 --> 01:33:42.315
Victor.

779
01:33:42.357 --> 01:33:43.525
Don't do it.

780
01:33:44.901 --> 01:33:46.111
He's your brother.

781
01:35:22.123 --> 01:35:23.458
How long was I asleep?

782
01:35:25.043 --> 01:35:26.211
Three days.

783
01:35:37.847 --> 01:35:40.183
Here you have everything
you need for a new life.


784
01:35:44.103 --> 01:35:44.979
Are you leaving?

785
01:35:48.274 --> 01:35:49.150
Yes.

786
01:36:33.153 --> 01:36:37.532
ONE YEAR LATER

787
01:36:40.034 --> 01:36:43.663
Victor Faust did more than just set me
free from a life of abuse and slavery.


788
01:36:44.456 --> 01:36:45.498
He changed me.

789
01:36:46.249 --> 01:36:47.959
He made me feel real emotions.

790
01:36:48.751 --> 01:36:49.961
He set me free.

791
01:36:50.837 --> 01:36:52.755
There's not a single day
that I don't think about him.


792
01:36:53.590 --> 01:36:55.967
Or the life I could
have had thanks to his help.


793
01:36:57.302 --> 01:36:58.761
But this is the life I choose.

794
01:36:59.429 --> 01:37:01.222
With or without Victor.

795
01:37:01.848 --> 01:37:03.641
Welcome. Do you have an appointment?

796
01:37:04.350 --> 01:37:06.728
-I'm here to see Arthur Hamburg.
-Your name, please?


797
01:37:07.312 --> 01:37:08.480
Izabel Seyfried.

798
01:41:06.217 --> 01:41:08.219
