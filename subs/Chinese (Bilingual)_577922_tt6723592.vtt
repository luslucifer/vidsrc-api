1
00:01:10.511 --> 00:01:12.847
叫醒美国佬

2
00:01:14.223 --> 00:01:15.141
嘿
Hey!


3
00:01:48.382 --> 00:01:50.676
（国家歌剧院）

4
00:02:59.453 --> 00:03:01.288
我们活在一个暮光世界
We live in a twilight world.


5
00:03:03.082 --> 00:03:04.834
我们活在一个暮光世界
We live in a twilight world.


6
00:03:05.501 --> 00:03:06.961
且黄昏时没有朋友
And there are no friends at dusk.


7
00:03:07.044 --> 00:03:10.047
你的身分曝光 这场突袭是为了消灭你
You've been made. This siege is a blind for them to vanish you.


8
00:03:15.177 --> 00:03:17.096
但我建立了联系
But I established contact.


9
00:03:17.179 --> 00:03:20.724
带你走或杀了你 我只有两分钟 快做决定
Bring you in or kill you. I have two minutes. Make up your mind.


10
00:03:25.813 --> 00:03:27.106
东西在哪里？
Where's the package?


11
00:03:27.398 --> 00:03:28.274
衣帽间
Coat check.


12
00:03:53.007 --> 00:03:53.841
待在这里
Stay.


13
00:04:05.603 --> 00:04:07.146
拿他的

14
00:04:12.151 --> 00:04:13.486
你在干嘛？

15
00:04:14.278 --> 00:04:15.237
你在干嘛？

16
00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:18.240
你是谁？

17
00:04:20.326 --> 00:04:21.827
黄昏时没有朋友？
No friends at dusk, huh?


18
00:04:21.911 --> 00:04:24.330
有你就行 带他到集合点
You'll do. Get him to the rally point.


19
00:04:56.445 --> 00:04:59.198
换衣服 乌克兰人等的是一名乘客
Swap clothes. The Ukrainians are expecting a passenger.


20
00:04:59.532 --> 00:05:01.242
我从没看过这种容器
I've never seen encapsulation like this.


21
00:05:01.325 --> 00:05:03.410
不知道有多古老 但是货真价实
We don't know how old it is, but it's the real deal.


22
00:05:03.494 --> 00:05:04.453
有逃脱备案吗？
Did you have an out?


23
00:05:04.537 --> 00:05:06.330
通往下水道的施工隧道
Service tunnel to the sewer.


24
00:05:06.497 --> 00:05:09.667
拿去 带他走他的出口 我不信任我们的人
Take this. Take him. Take his exit. I don't trust ours anymore.


25
00:05:09.792 --> 00:05:10.709
能拆除炸弹吗？
Can you defuse that?


26
00:05:10.793 --> 00:05:12.628
那会同步引爆 还有更多吗？

27
00:05:13.796 --> 00:05:15.423
-连观众也炸？ -人命不值钱

28
00:05:15.506 --> 00:05:16.715
任务不是救人
- Taking out the audience? - They're just the cheap seats.


29
00:05:43.325 --> 00:05:44.326
快走吧
Walk away.


30
00:05:48.289 --> 00:05:50.291
你不必杀死这些人
You don't have to kill these people.


31
00:06:03.179 --> 00:06:05.723
-他不是我们的人 -我需要帮手
That wasn't one of us. I'll take the help.


32
00:06:07.850 --> 00:06:08.684
快走 快走
Go, go, go.


33
00:06:22.907 --> 00:06:24.241
不是那家伙

34
00:06:39.757 --> 00:06:42.885
人在受训后 撑得住18小时刑求
A man can be trained to hold out for about 18 hours,


35
00:06:43.052 --> 00:06:46.013
所以你的同僚7点后就安全了
so your colleagues will be clear by 7:00.


36
00:06:52.311 --> 00:06:54.063
他连18分钟都撑不住
He didn't last 18 minutes.


37
00:06:54.188 --> 00:06:55.981
他没什么好隐瞒了
He didn't have anything to hide.


38
00:06:56.148 --> 00:06:58.442
你救出个无名小卒
You were smuggling a nobody.


39
00:07:01.445 --> 00:07:03.114
风险很大
It's risky.


40
00:07:06.450 --> 00:07:08.702
还是你指望这玩意？
Or were you counting on this?


41
00:07:08.869 --> 00:07:12.164
自杀药丸 中情局标配
Death. CIA issue.


42
00:07:19.505 --> 00:07:22.591
他们一旦安全就让自己活命
Spare yourself, once they clear.


43
00:07:36.939 --> 00:07:40.109
就快7点了 糟糕
Almost 7:00. Uh-oh.


44
00:07:45.489 --> 00:07:47.116
时钟跑太快
It's running fast.


45
00:07:51.036 --> 00:07:53.372
我得拨慢一小时
We have to put it back one hour.


46
00:08:12.892 --> 00:08:14.602
吐出来
Get it out!


47
00:08:38.292 --> 00:08:40.461
欢迎来到来世
Welcome to the afterlife.


48
00:08:41.087 --> 00:08:43.714
你陷入人工昏迷期间
You've been in a medically-induced coma


49
00:08:43.798 --> 00:08:47.134
我们把你救出来 重建你的口腔
while we got you out of Ukraine and rebuilt your mouth.


50
00:08:47.301 --> 00:08:51.347
自杀药丸是假的
The suicide pills are fake.


51
00:08:52.223 --> 00:08:53.516
为什么？
Why?


52
00:08:53.682 --> 00:08:54.934
这是个考验
A test.


53
00:08:55.309 --> 00:08:56.477
考验？
A test?


54
00:08:59.772 --> 00:09:01.649
他们拔光我的牙齿
They pulled my teeth out.


55
00:09:03.192 --> 00:09:05.402
小队安全逃走了吗？
Did my team get clear?


56
00:09:06.195 --> 00:09:09.740
没有 可能是俄罗斯佣兵干的
No. Private Russians, we think.


57
00:09:10.741 --> 00:09:12.660
有人招供
Somebody talked.


58
00:09:13.702 --> 00:09:14.829
你没有
Not you.


59
00:09:15.454 --> 00:09:18.374
你宁死也不愿放弃同僚
You chose to die instead of giving up your colleagues.


60
00:09:27.466 --> 00:09:30.302
我们都相信自己会冲进火场
We all believe we'd run into the burning building.


61
00:09:31.470 --> 00:09:33.848
直到感受到热浪
But until we feel that heat,


62
00:09:36.343 --> 00:09:37.711
谁也不能确定 但你能
we can never know.You do.


63
00:09:42.940 --> 00:09:44.191
我辞职
I resign.


64
00:09:44.567 --> 00:09:47.236
你不替我们做事 你已经死了
You don't work for us. You're dead.


65
00:09:48.487 --> 00:09:51.282
你的职责超越国家利益
Your duty transcends national interests.


66
00:09:51.449 --> 00:09:53.200
这是为了人类存亡
This is about survival.


67
00:09:55.578 --> 00:09:56.704
谁的？
Whose?


68
00:09:59.290 --> 00:10:00.624
所有人
Everyone's.


69
00:10:03.210 --> 00:10:05.755
这是一场冷酷无情的冷战
There's a cold war, cold as ice.


70
00:10:06.630 --> 00:10:10.134
只要知道它的本质就会输
To even know its true nature is to lose.


71
00:10:10.301 --> 00:10:12.136
天机不可泄漏
This is knowledge divided.


72
00:10:12.219 --> 00:10:17.892
我只能给你一个手势 加上一个字
All I have for you is a gesture in combination with a word.


73
00:10:18.058 --> 00:10:19.185
天能
"Tenet."


74
00:10:21.020 --> 00:10:22.313
小心运用
Use it carefully.


75
00:10:24.023 --> 00:10:27.151
它能开启正确的门 也会打开错误的门
It'll open the right doors, but some of the wrong ones, too.


76
00:10:27.234 --> 00:10:29.153
他们只告诉你这些？
That's all they've told you?


77
00:10:30.404 --> 00:10:32.072
你通过的考验
That test you passed?


78
00:10:33.449 --> 00:10:35.534
不是每个人都能通过
Not everybody does.


79
00:12:15.009 --> 00:12:18.804
（爱西尼号）

80
00:12:31.525 --> 00:12:33.444
（启动）

81
00:12:45.539 --> 00:12:47.792
（B-2室）

82
00:12:47.958 --> 00:12:52.379
穿上反光背心 拿着笔记板 几乎就能闯入任何地方
With a high-vis vest and a clipboard, you can get almost anywhere.


83
00:12:52.546 --> 00:12:54.173
几乎啦
Almost.


84
00:12:55.091 --> 00:12:56.801
谜一般的天能
An obscure tenet.


85
00:13:05.059 --> 00:13:08.479
别闲聊 别曝露我们的身分和目的
No small talk. Nothing that might reveal who we are or what we do.


86
00:13:08.979 --> 00:13:11.232
我以为我是来找出任务目的
I thought I was here to find out what we do.


87
00:13:11.774 --> 00:13:14.151
你不必知道 只要学会
You're not here for "what," you're here for "how."


88
00:13:14.443 --> 00:13:17.571
那是你的任务 与我无关
"What" is your department and not my business.


89
00:13:17.738 --> 00:13:19.365
为了执行任务
Well, to do what I do...


90
00:13:20.116 --> 00:13:22.576
我需要知道面对什么威胁
I need some idea of the threat we face.


91
00:13:25.287 --> 00:13:28.916
以我的了解 我们试图阻止第三次世界大战
As I understand it, we're trying to prevent World War III.


92
00:13:29.166 --> 00:13:30.543
核战？
Nuclear holocaust?


93
00:13:31.127 --> 00:13:32.128
不
No.


94
00:13:33.712 --> 00:13:35.256
更糟的事
Something worse.


95
00:13:44.598 --> 00:13:45.850
瞄准后开枪
Aim it and pull the trigger.


96
00:13:47.935 --> 00:13:49.186
弹匣是空的
It's empty.


97
00:13:49.270 --> 00:13:50.229
瞄准
Aim it.


98
00:13:55.901 --> 00:13:57.069
检查弹匣
Check the magazine.


99
00:14:01.490 --> 00:14:02.700
怎么会？
How?


100
00:14:08.372 --> 00:14:12.460
其中一颗子弹和我们一样 顺着时间向前进
One of these bullets is like us, traveling forwards through time.


101
00:14:12.668 --> 00:14:14.962
另一颗则是向后退
The other one's going backwards.


102
00:14:15.421 --> 00:14:17.631
分得出来吗？
Can you tell which is which?


103
00:14:19.508 --> 00:14:22.803
现在呢？完全逆转
How about now?


104
00:14:22.970 --> 00:14:27.391
熵造成反向运作 让动作看起来全都倒转
It's inverted. Its entropy runs backwards. So, to our eyes, its movement is reversed.


105
00:14:27.475 --> 00:14:30.853
可能是核分裂引发的反向辐射
We think it's a type of inverse radiation triggered by nuclear fission.


106
00:14:30.978 --> 00:14:33.314
-不是你制造的？ -我们还不知道怎么做
You didn't make it?


107
00:14:34.857 --> 00:14:39.028
有人在未来制造 然后逆转时间传送给我们
Someone's manufacturing them in the future. They're streaming back at us.


108
00:14:39.195 --> 00:14:40.362
试试看
Try it.


109
00:14:47.620 --> 00:14:50.247
你要想着放下子弹
You have to have dropped it.


110
00:15:01.467 --> 00:15:03.094
我还没碰 它怎么会动？
How can it move before I touch it?


111
00:15:03.177 --> 00:15:06.013
从你的角度是你抓住子弹
From your point of view, you caught it.


112
00:15:06.097 --> 00:15:08.516
从子弹的角度是你放下它
But from the bullet's point of view, you dropped it.


113
00:15:08.599 --> 00:15:10.518
但原因应该先于结果
But cause comes before effect.


114
00:15:10.601 --> 00:15:13.312
不 那是我们看待时间的方法
No, that's just the way we see time.


115
00:15:13.437 --> 00:15:15.064
自由意志呢？
Well, what about free will?


116
00:15:15.147 --> 00:15:17.733
你不出手 那颗子弹就不会动
That bullet wouldn't have moved if you hadn't put your hand there.


117
00:15:17.900 --> 00:15:20.778
不管怎么看 都是你造成的
Either way we run the tape, you made it happen.


118
00:15:22.071 --> 00:15:23.781
别试着理解它
Don't try to understand it.


119
00:15:25.032 --> 00:15:26.242
感受它
Feel it.


120
00:15:36.836 --> 00:15:37.962
直觉
Instinct.


121
00:15:39.713 --> 00:15:40.840
我懂了
Got it.


122
00:15:45.678 --> 00:15:47.680
为何感觉这么奇怪？
Why does it feel so strange?


123
00:15:48.848 --> 00:15:52.560
你不是射出子弹 而是接住它
You're not shooting the bullet, you're catching it.


124
00:15:54.228 --> 00:15:55.771
哇塞
Whoa.


125
00:15:58.399 --> 00:16:00.443
我看过这种子弹
I've seen this type of ammunition before.


126
00:16:00.568 --> 00:16:01.485
出任务时
In the field?


127
00:16:01.777 --> 00:16:02.778
我差点被打中
I was almost hit.


128
00:16:02.862 --> 00:16:04.530
那你很幸运
Then you were exceedingly lucky.


129
00:16:05.364 --> 00:16:09.493
被逆转的子弹打中会受重伤 下场很惨
An inverted bullet passing through your body would be devastating. Not pretty.


130
00:16:10.995 --> 00:16:12.496
这些像是现代的子弹
These look like today's.


131
00:16:12.580 --> 00:16:15.082
可能是现在制造 却在多年后被逆转
They may have been made today and inverted years from now.


132
00:16:15.166 --> 00:16:16.167
从哪弄来的？
Where did you get them?


133
00:16:17.411 --> 00:16:20.414
墙上挖出来的 我奉命研究这里所有的物质
Came with the wall. I was assigned it, like all the material I'm studying here.


134
00:16:20.087 --> 00:16:21.672
分析过金属成分吗？
Do you have an analysis on the metals?


135
00:16:22.047 --> 00:16:23.591
当然了 怎么了？
Sure. Why?


136
00:16:23.674 --> 00:16:27.511
混合哪些合金我也许能辨识 是在哪里制造 听好
The mixture of alloys can tell me where they might have been made. Look...


137
00:16:28.929 --> 00:16:30.639
这不是世界末日
I'm not seeing Armageddon here.


138
00:16:33.225 --> 00:16:35.895
子弹看似普通 但却是一台简单机器
The bullet may not seem like much, but it's a simple machine.


139
00:16:35.978 --> 00:16:38.731
铅弹头、铜弹壳、火药
Lead bullet, brass casing, gunpowder.


140
00:16:39.607 --> 00:16:43.068
他们能逆转子弹就能逆转任何东西
If they can invert that, I see no reason they couldn't invert pretty much anything.


141
00:16:43.152 --> 00:16:46.197
一枚核弹只能危害人类未来
Even a nuclear weapon can only affect our future.


142
00:16:46.363 --> 00:16:49.909
但逆转时间的武器却能毁灭这世界
An inverted weapon might be able to affect our past as well.


143
00:16:53.704 --> 00:16:57.708
既然已经知道这种科技 就能找到更多逆转的物质
Now that we know what to look for, we're finding more and more inverted material.


144
00:16:58.167 --> 00:17:00.961
更复杂的残余物
Remnants of complex objects.


145
00:17:04.381 --> 00:17:05.925
你觉得这些是什么？
What do you think we're seeing?


146
00:17:07.885 --> 00:17:10.262
即将来临的战争废墟
The detritus of a coming war.


147
00:17:29.406 --> 00:17:31.325
-喂？ -我们活在一个暮光世界
- Yep? - We live in a twilight world.


148
00:17:31.408 --> 00:17:33.661
黄昏时没有朋友 我听说你死了
No friends at dusk. I was told you left the building.


149
00:17:33.744 --> 00:17:35.287
就连死人也需要盟友
Even the dead need allies.


150
00:17:35.371 --> 00:17:36.539
什么盟友？
Specifically?


151
00:17:37.164 --> 00:17:40.126
我在孟买需要帮手找到桑杰辛格
I need an assist in Mumbai. I need to get to Sanjay Singh.


152
00:17:40.334 --> 00:17:43.170
辛格？他足不出户 他家
Singh? He never leaves his house. And his house is...


153
00:17:43.754 --> 00:17:46.257
-很高 -没错 我看到了
- his house. - Yes, it is.


154
00:17:48.134 --> 00:17:50.344
两小时后孟买游艇俱乐部见
Bombay Yacht Club in two hours.


155
00:18:02.606 --> 00:18:07.153
看来你临时需要人介绍 一位有威望的孟买当地人士
It seems you need an introduction to a prominent Mumbai local on short notice.


156
00:18:08.404 --> 00:18:11.574
-我是尼尔 -我想见桑杰辛格
I'm Neil. I need an audience with Sanjay Singh.


157
00:18:13.993 --> 00:18:15.077
不可能
That's not possible.


158
00:18:15.244 --> 00:18:17.538
最多10分钟
Ten minutes tops.


159
00:18:18.205 --> 00:18:19.832
问题不是时间
Time isn't the problem.


160
00:18:20.833 --> 00:18:23.085
而是能不能活着出来
It's getting out alive that's the problem.


161
00:18:26.046 --> 00:18:29.300
你会胁持小孩或女人当人质吗？
Would you take a child hostage? A woman?


162
00:18:29.383 --> 00:18:32.219
有必要的话 我不想要惹麻烦
If I had to. I'm not looking to make much noise here.


163
00:18:32.845 --> 00:18:33.763
点什么？
Yes?


164
00:18:33.846 --> 00:18:36.724
伏特加通宁和健怡可乐
Vodka tonic. And a Diet Coke.


165
00:18:39.101 --> 00:18:40.186
怎么了？
What?


166
00:18:41.270 --> 00:18:43.981
-你出任务时不喝酒 -知道就好
You never drink on the job. You're well-informed.


167
00:18:44.064 --> 00:18:47.651
这是干我们这一行的好处
Well, pays to be in our profession.


168
00:18:47.735 --> 00:18:49.737
我宁愿喝苏打水
Well, I prefer soda water.


169
00:18:52.198 --> 00:18:53.574
才怪
No, you don't.


170
00:18:54.700 --> 00:18:56.577
你的跳伞技术怎样？
How's your parachuting?


171
00:18:56.744 --> 00:18:58.579
受训时摔断过脚踝
I broke an ankle during basic training.


172
00:18:58.746 --> 00:19:01.540
辛格的房子不够高 不能跳伞
Singh's house isn't tall enough to parachute off of.


173
00:19:02.041 --> 00:19:05.711
-但具有高空弹跳性 -高空弹跳性不算个词
It's bungee-jumpable. I don't think "bungee-jumpable" is a word.


174
00:19:05.878 --> 00:19:08.756
也许不是 但那是唯一逃脱的方法
It may not be a word, but it may be our only way out of that place.


175
00:19:10.091 --> 00:19:11.967
或是闯进去的方法
Or into it, for that matter.


176
00:19:51.549 --> 00:19:54.301
我知道你累了 我也很累
I know you're tired. I'm also very tired.


177
00:20:56.697 --> 00:20:58.157
退后
Stay back.


178
00:20:58.324 --> 00:21:02.286
我在乌克兰差点被一种 非比寻常的子弹射死
I was almost taken out by a very unusual type of ammunition in Ukraine.


179
00:21:02.369 --> 00:21:04.705
我想知道是谁给的
I want to know who supplied it.


180
00:21:04.872 --> 00:21:07.792
我是桑杰 你是？
My name is Sanjay. And you are?


181
00:21:08.876 --> 00:21:10.044
不想闲聊？
No chitchat?


182
00:21:10.753 --> 00:21:14.256
不会有人回应 也没人会来救你
There's no one at the other end. No one who's gonna help you, anyway.


183
00:21:16.008 --> 00:21:17.551
别让食物凉掉
Don't let it get cold.


184
00:21:19.637 --> 00:21:21.555
我怎么知道是谁给的？
Why should I know who supplied it?


185
00:21:21.639 --> 00:21:24.308
金属成分只有印度才有
Combination of metals is unique to India.


186
00:21:24.391 --> 00:21:25.935
来自印度就是你给的

187
00:21:27.728 --> 00:21:30.898
好吧 推理 朋友
Deduction, then.


188
00:21:34.193 --> 00:21:36.862
我不是被派来谈判的
I'm not the man they send to negotiate.


189
00:21:38.072 --> 00:21:40.116
也不是来跟你交易
Or the man they send to make deals.


190
00:21:40.199 --> 00:21:42.993
但有事大家都来找我
But I am the man people talk to.


191
00:21:44.829 --> 00:21:47.414
不行 我不能告诉你
I can't.


192
00:21:51.961 --> 00:21:56.173
泄漏客户的机密 会违反他奉为准则的教条
This may be the easiest trigger I've ever had to pull. To say anything about a client would violate the tenets he lives by.


193
00:21:57.133 --> 00:21:58.884
如果你这么重视教条
If tenets are important to you, then you can tell me.


194
00:21:59.093 --> 00:22:01.929
那你就能告诉我一切

195
00:22:05.433 --> 00:22:08.352
桑杰 请替客人倒杯酒
Sanjay, make a drink for our guest, please.


196
00:22:08.978 --> 00:22:11.564
干杯 我是普莉亚
Cheers. - Priya. - Hmm.


197
00:22:12.773 --> 00:22:14.608
你才是幕后老大？
This is your operation?


198
00:22:14.984 --> 00:22:18.028
拿男人当傀儡在男人世界很有用
A masculine front in a man's world has its uses.


199
00:22:18.112 --> 00:22:20.406
你找的军火商是安德烈萨托
The dealer you're looking for is Andrei Sator.


200
00:22:20.531 --> 00:22:21.657
俄国的大财阀
The Russian oligarch.


201
00:22:21.824 --> 00:22:23.451
-你认识他？ -没有私交
- You know him? - Not personally.


202
00:22:23.617 --> 00:22:25.953
靠天然气成为亿万富豪
Made his billions in gas.


203
00:22:26.120 --> 00:22:29.415
听说在莫斯科失宠后搬到伦敦
Moved to London. Said to be on the outs with Moscow.


204
00:22:29.582 --> 00:22:31.250
很好
Very good.


205
00:22:31.417 --> 00:22:34.420
但他不是靠天然气致富 而是靠钚元素
Except the gas he made his billions from was actually plutonium.


206
00:22:34.503 --> 00:22:38.340
这不能解释你为何或如何 把逆转子弹卖给他
None of which explains how or why you sold him inverted munitions.


207
00:22:38.424 --> 00:22:40.926
我卖子弹给他的时候 它们都很普通
When I sold him the rounds, they were perfectly ordinary.


208
00:22:41.010 --> 00:22:42.678
他是怎么逆转子弹？
So how did he get them inverted?


209
00:22:43.554 --> 00:22:46.348
我们认为他只是个掮客
We believe he's functioning as some sort of a broker.


210
00:22:46.432 --> 00:22:48.559
现在和未来的中间人
Between our time and the future.


211
00:22:49.935 --> 00:22:51.562
他能和未来的人沟通？
He can communicate with the future?


212
00:22:51.645 --> 00:22:55.316
我们都行啊 电邮、信用卡、简讯
We all do, don't we? E-mails, credit cards, texts.


213
00:22:55.399 --> 00:22:58.486
任何纪录都能直接和未来的人沟通
Anything that goes into the record speaks directly to the future.


214
00:22:59.320 --> 00:23:02.448
问题是 未来的人能回应吗？
The question is, can the future speak back?


215
00:23:03.407 --> 00:23:05.034
我要负责查出来？
And I'm supposed to find out?


216
00:23:05.868 --> 00:23:09.163
想靠近萨托就需要全新的主人翁
To get anywhere near Sator would take a fresh-faced protagonist.


217
00:23:09.955 --> 00:23:12.333
你就是最好的人选
And you are fresh as a daisy.


218
00:23:12.541 --> 00:23:16.087
接近他 查出他用什么方法收到什么
Get close. Find out what he's receiving and how.


219
00:23:16.170 --> 00:23:18.422
让英国情报局介入安全吗？
Is it safe to involve British Intelligence?


220
00:23:18.506 --> 00:23:21.092
我有个萨托动不了的联络人
I have a contact who's out of Sator's reach.


221
00:23:27.139 --> 00:23:29.350
你一定有逃走的计划
You must've had a plan for getting out.


222
00:23:29.892 --> 00:23:31.685
我并不喜欢
Not one I love.


223
00:23:54.917 --> 00:23:56.585
我能效劳吗？
May I help you, sir?


224
00:23:56.669 --> 00:23:58.045
我是寇斯比先生的午餐
I'm Mr. Crosby's lunch.


225
00:23:58.129 --> 00:24:01.132
我假设你和麦可寇斯比爵士约吃午餐
I presume you mean Sir Michael Crosby's lunch.


226
00:24:01.215 --> 00:24:02.299
尽管假设吧
Presume away.


227
00:24:02.383 --> 00:24:03.843
请跟我来
If you'll follow me.


228
00:24:08.556 --> 00:24:11.142
我先吃了 别介意
Started without you. Hope you don't mind.


229
00:24:11.559 --> 00:24:12.768
我会跟上的
I'll catch up.


230
00:24:13.769 --> 00:24:15.020
我要一样的
Same for me, please.


231
00:24:15.104 --> 00:24:16.147
我叫服务生来
I'll send the waiter.


232
00:24:16.230 --> 00:24:17.857
交代一声就行了
No, just pass on the order.


233
00:24:18.858 --> 00:24:21.861
我猜你对某个俄国人士有兴趣
I gather you have an interest in a certain Russian national.


234
00:24:21.986 --> 00:24:24.572
英俄人士 我得格外小心
Anglo-Russian. So I have to watch my step.


235
00:24:24.655 --> 00:24:27.366
没错 他是英国情报局的线人
Indeed. He's tapped into the intelligence services.


236
00:24:27.533 --> 00:24:30.244
我警告过他们 他都乱给情报
I've warned them he's feeding them rubbish...


237
00:24:30.578 --> 00:24:32.037
但他们似乎不在乎
but they don't seem to care.


238
00:24:32.329 --> 00:24:33.205
跟我说说他
Tell me about him.


239
00:24:34.375 --> 00:24:37.845
你应该对 苏联时期的秘密城市很熟悉
I assume you're familiar with the Soviet-era secret cities.


240
00:24:37.460 --> 00:24:41.422
地图上找不到的封闭城市 建立在敏感企业周围
Closed cities, not shown on maps. Built around sensitive industries.


241
00:24:41.589 --> 00:24:44.675
多数都已开放 也重新命名为一般城镇
Most of them have been opened up and renamed as regular towns.


242
00:24:44.759 --> 00:24:48.095
但萨托成长的城市并不是 史托斯克12市
Not the one Sator grew up in.


243
00:24:54.995 --> 00:24:58.399
出了意外 后来就用来做地下核试验
Some kind of accident. After which it was used for underground tests.


244
00:24:57.897 --> 00:25:00.858
两星期前 发生基辅歌剧院突袭的同一天
Two weeks ago, same day as the Kiev opera siege,


245
00:25:00.941 --> 00:25:03.986
我们发现北西伯利亚发生核爆
we spotted a detonation in northern Siberia,


246
00:25:04.069 --> 00:25:06.405
就在史托斯克12市的旧址
just where Stalsk-12 was.


247
00:25:06.572 --> 00:25:09.742
萨托从地图上的空白中崛起
Sator emerged from this blank spot on the map


248
00:25:09.950 --> 00:25:14.955
野心勃勃 砸下大钱进入英国体制
with ambition... and enough money to buy his way into the British establishment.


249
00:25:15.039 --> 00:25:16.040
透过他妻子？
Through his wife?


250
00:25:17.218 --> 00:25:19.787
凯萨琳巴顿 佛德瑞克巴顿爵士的大侄女
Katherine Barton. Oldest niece of Sir Frederick Barton.


251
00:25:19.210 --> 00:25:21.712
她在薛普利拍卖行工作 拍卖会上认识了萨托
She works at Shipley's. Met Sator at an auction.


252
00:25:21.796 --> 00:25:22.671
婚姻幸福？
A happy marriage?


253
00:25:22.755 --> 00:25:24.215
早已形同陌路
Practically estranged.


254
00:25:24.757 --> 00:25:27.426
-我要怎么接近萨托？ -当然是透过她
Well, how do I get to Sator?


255
00:25:30.763 --> 00:25:31.764
非也
Hardly.


256
00:25:32.848 --> 00:25:34.850
我们有一张王牌
We have an ace in the hole.


257
00:25:37.728 --> 00:25:40.147
你用购物袋装哥雅名画
You're carrying a Goya in a Harrods bag.


258
00:25:40.272 --> 00:25:42.942
这是西班牙人阿雷波画的假画
It's a fake by a Spaniard named Arepo.


259
00:25:43.025 --> 00:25:46.195
从瑞士伯恩没收来的其中一幅
One of two we've confiscated from an embezzler in Bern.


260
00:25:46.403 --> 00:25:47.613
另一幅怎么了？
What happened to the other one?


261
00:25:47.696 --> 00:25:50.908
经过凯萨琳监定后 出现在薛普利拍卖行
It turned up at Shipley's. Authenticated by Katherine Barton.


262
00:25:50.991 --> 00:25:53.869
然后拿去拍卖 你猜被谁买走？
Put on auction. And who do you think bought it?


263
00:25:54.036 --> 00:25:55.079
她丈夫？
Her husband?


264
00:25:55.689 --> 00:25:56.924
Mmm-hmm.

265
00:25:57.665 --> 00:25:59.375
她知道是假画吗？
Does she know it's a forgery?


266
00:25:59.542 --> 00:26:00.751
很难说
Oh, it's hard to say.


267
00:26:00.835 --> 00:26:04.880
谣传她和阿雷波关系亲密
Rumor has it that she and Arepo were close.


268
00:26:04.964 --> 00:26:06.090
嗯
Uh-huh.


269
00:26:07.216 --> 00:26:09.301
别介意喔
Look, no offense,


270
00:26:09.468 --> 00:26:12.888
但你若想假冒一个亿万富豪
but in this world, when someone is claiming to be a billionaire...


271
00:26:14.390 --> 00:26:16.684
穿平价西装可骗不了人
Brooks Brothers won't cut it.


272
00:26:16.767 --> 00:26:18.310
我的预算有限
I'm assuming I'm on a budget.


273
00:26:18.477 --> 00:26:21.063
先拯救世界再核销开支
Save the world, then we'll balance the books.


274
00:26:21.730 --> 00:26:23.315
让我推荐一位裁缝师
Can I recommend a tailor?


275
00:26:23.482 --> 00:26:24.608
不用劳您大驾
I'll manage.


276
00:26:24.692 --> 00:26:27.111
不是你们英国人才会狗眼看人低
You British don't have a monopoly on snobbery, you know.


277
00:26:27.236 --> 00:26:31.157
你误会了 我们只想插一脚
Well, not a monopoly. More of a controlling interest.


278
00:26:31.991 --> 00:26:33.659
麻烦帮我打包
Could you box that up for me?


279
00:26:33.742 --> 00:26:34.910
想都别想
Certainly not.


280
00:26:36.120 --> 00:26:37.955
再见 麦可爵士
Goodbye, Sir Michael.


281
00:26:47.298 --> 00:26:52.052
（坎农街3号）

282
00:27:08.611 --> 00:27:10.488
（薛普利拍卖行）

283
00:27:10.654 --> 00:27:12.323
我能效劳吗？
How can I help, sir?


284
00:27:15.409 --> 00:27:18.454
抱歉 您没预约 这位先生
Sorry, I wasn't notified of any appointments, Mr...


285
00:27:18.537 --> 00:27:19.538
哥雅
Goya.


286
00:27:20.790 --> 00:27:21.707
哥雅先生？
Mr. Goya.


287
00:27:22.977 --> 00:27:25.212
不是 我听说你能监定哥雅名画
No. I'm told you're the person to see about Goya.


288
00:27:27.171 --> 00:27:28.589
太了不起了
That's extraordinary.


289
00:27:33.677 --> 00:27:35.054
值多少钱？
What's it worth?


290
00:27:36.347 --> 00:27:37.973
先别急
Let's not get ahead of ourselves.


291
00:27:39.558 --> 00:27:42.228
估价前要做很多监定
Lots of work to do before any kind of valuation.


292
00:27:43.813 --> 00:27:47.483
收藏历史、显微镜和X光检验
Provenance, microscopic examination, X-rays.


293
00:27:47.650 --> 00:27:49.819
你的直觉是什么？
But what does your heart tell you?


294
00:27:53.989 --> 00:27:56.158
你说是向谁买下这幅画？
Sir, where did you say you acquired this drawing?


295
00:27:56.826 --> 00:27:58.035
汤玛士阿雷波
Tomas Arepo.


296
00:28:01.831 --> 00:28:04.917
我用几分美金 向愤怒的瑞士银行家买下这幅画
I bought my Goya for cents on a dollar from an irate Swiss banker.


297
00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:07.920
追溯到阿雷波 才发现我挖到宝
Traced it back to Arepo, then realized I scored a bargain


298
00:28:08.003 --> 00:28:10.798
因为他告诉我 谁用高价买下他另一幅假画
when he told me who paid top dollar for another one of his pictures.


299
00:28:10.881 --> 00:28:12.842
-你先生 -你挖到什么宝？
- Your husband. - Where's your bargain?


300
00:28:12.925 --> 00:28:14.468
这画显然是假的
Your drawing's an obvious fake.


301
00:28:14.552 --> 00:28:17.721
我的画是幅逼真的假画 你比谁都清楚
My drawing's a very good fake.


302
00:28:20.850 --> 00:28:23.352
我帮忙诈骗自己老公这件事？
The information that I helped defraud my own husband?


303
00:28:23.436 --> 00:28:26.439
他和我算是同行 但想见到他真的很难
He and I are in related businesses, but he's a very hard man to meet.


304
00:28:26.605 --> 00:28:29.358
-假如我们谈笔交易 -交易？
If you and I were to make an arrangement...


305
00:28:31.026 --> 00:28:34.530
别这么怕这字眼 我先生并不怕
Don't be afraid of the word. My husband isn't.


306
00:28:34.697 --> 00:28:36.449
很遗憾 他抢先你一步
I'm sorry to tell you he got there first.


307
00:28:36.532 --> 00:28:38.659
他早就知道却没有采取行动？
He knows? And he's never done anything about it?


308
00:28:38.742 --> 00:28:41.287
-何必呢？ -他被骗了9百万美元啊
Why would he? He paid $9 million for it.


309
00:28:41.370 --> 00:28:43.873
不过就是他逼我们度假的花费
Barely cover the cost of the holiday he just forced us on.


310
00:28:43.956 --> 00:28:45.416
去火星度假吗？
Where'd you go, Mars?


311
00:28:46.625 --> 00:28:49.545
越南 坐我们的游艇 他的游艇
Vietnam, on our yacht. His yacht.


312
00:28:50.296 --> 00:28:53.132
你一身高级西装、名鞋、名表
You've got the suit. The shoes, the watch.


313
00:28:53.924 --> 00:28:55.509
却有点自不量力
Think you're a little out of your depth.


314
00:28:56.677 --> 00:28:59.847
像你先生这种财富庞大的有钱人
People who've amassed fortunes, like your husband's,


315
00:29:00.014 --> 00:29:03.601
通常不会容忍自己被诈骗
generally aren't okay with being cheated out of any of it.


316
00:29:09.106 --> 00:29:11.984
那幅画是用来控制我的把柄
The drawing is his hold over me.


317
00:29:15.613 --> 00:29:20.618
他威胁要报警 让我坐牢
He threatened me with police. Prison. The works.


318
00:29:22.828 --> 00:29:24.705
他控制我
He controls me.


319
00:29:24.872 --> 00:29:27.625
我和儿子的相处 所有的一切
My contact with my son. Everything.


320
00:29:27.792 --> 00:29:31.003
离开他本就很难 现在更不可能了
Leaving would never have been easy but now it's impossible.


321
00:29:32.296 --> 00:29:34.298
我反抗不了他
You can't fight.


322
00:29:34.924 --> 00:29:36.926
只能哀求他
Just beg.


323
00:29:39.053 --> 00:29:41.347
我在越南试过再去爱他
In Vietnam, I tried to love him again.


324
00:29:41.430 --> 00:29:44.600
以为如果有爱 他就会把儿子还给我
Thought if there was love there, he might give me my son back.


325
00:29:44.767 --> 00:29:48.854
我们坐在天杀的游艇上看夕阳
We sat on that bloody boat watching the sunsets,


326
00:29:49.063 --> 00:29:51.273
重温昔日幸福时光
imitating some earlier time in our lives.


327
00:29:51.440 --> 00:29:53.609
他似乎很快乐 于是我问他
He seemed happy, so I asked him.


328
00:29:54.485 --> 00:29:55.986
他提出条件
And he made me an offer.


329
00:29:56.278 --> 00:29:59.698
我不再见儿子他就放我走
He'd let me go if I agreed never to see my son again.


330
00:30:03.119 --> 00:30:06.247
我表达了意见 把麦斯带上岸
I expressed myself. I took Max ashore.


331
00:30:06.372 --> 00:30:10.167
他带着悔意打给我 当我们回到游艇
He called us, contrite.


332
00:30:10.251 --> 00:30:13.587
我却看到一个女人跳下海 然后他就消失不见
And when we got back, I glimpsed some other woman diving off the boat, and he'd vanished.


333
00:30:16.674 --> 00:30:18.551
我从来没这么嫉妒过
I never felt such envy.


334
00:30:18.634 --> 00:30:20.010
你不像是会嫉妒的人
You don't seem the jealous type.


335
00:30:20.094 --> 00:30:21.846
我嫉妒她的自由
Of her freedom.


336
00:30:25.224 --> 00:30:28.060
你知道我有多想跳下海吗？
You know how I dream of just diving off that boat?


337
00:30:28.144 --> 00:30:29.854
但你们有个儿子
But you share a son.


338
00:30:30.271 --> 00:30:32.189
那就是我现在的生活
That's my life now.


339
00:30:32.773 --> 00:30:34.817
你当时知道那是幅假画吗？
Did you know the drawing was a fake?


340
00:30:34.900 --> 00:30:38.362
不知道 我和汤玛士变得很亲密 也许太亲密了
No. Tomas and I became close, maybe too close.


341
00:30:38.446 --> 00:30:39.613
我让他失望了
I failed.


342
00:30:39.697 --> 00:30:42.324
安德烈不懂失望的感觉 只觉得遭到背叛
Andrei can't conceive of failure, only betrayal.


343
00:30:42.408 --> 00:30:44.326
但我没有背叛我丈夫
But I didn't betray my husband.


344
00:30:44.410 --> 00:30:46.829
回头看 或许我错失机会
Retrospect, maybe I missed my chance.


345
00:30:46.912 --> 00:30:48.581
而他则放阿雷波走
And he let Arepo walk free.


346
00:30:48.664 --> 00:30:50.791
如果你真的见过阿雷波
If you'd actually met Arepo as you claimed,


347
00:30:50.875 --> 00:30:53.461
就会知道他早已不能走路
you'd understand he no longer walks anywhere.


348
00:30:53.544 --> 00:30:56.505
-我们只讲过电话 -他也不能讲电话
We spoke on the phone. He can't do that either.


349
00:30:57.089 --> 00:30:58.758
-那幅画呢？ -要干嘛？
- Where's the drawing? - Why?


350
00:30:58.841 --> 00:31:02.386
把我介绍给他 我就把画偷走
Get me an introduction. I'll take the drawing out of the equation.


351
00:31:02.470 --> 00:31:05.055
没有画就不能告你 也不能威胁你
No picture, no prosecution, no more hold over you.


352
00:31:05.890 --> 00:31:07.850
我是你的第二次机会
I might just be your second chance.


353
00:31:07.933 --> 00:31:09.852
不 我不需要救赎
No, I don't need redemption.


354
00:31:09.935 --> 00:31:11.479
你要背叛他
At betrayal.


355
00:31:17.359 --> 00:31:18.736
你先生的朋友？
Friends of your husband's?


356
00:31:19.653 --> 00:31:21.155
你早就知道了？
You knew this was going to happen?


357
00:31:21.238 --> 00:31:23.449
放心 他们不会杀你
Don't worry, they won't kill you.


358
00:31:23.616 --> 00:31:26.619
安德烈不喜欢和当地警察打交道
Andrei dislikes tangling with local law enforcement on that level.


359
00:31:26.786 --> 00:31:28.913
你一定很不喜欢我的长相
You must've really not liked the look of me.


360
00:31:29.079 --> 00:31:30.122
你的长相没问题
The look of you's fine.


361
00:31:31.726 --> 00:31:34.963
最好先来狠的 免得我三心两意
It's best to get to the nasty part before I care one way or the other.


362
00:31:34.668 --> 00:31:37.463
你左边口袋有个号码 别从家里打来
There's a number in your left coat pocket. Don't call from home.


363
00:31:38.964 --> 00:31:40.841
你不会接到我的电话
You won't be taking my call.


364
00:31:42.551 --> 00:31:44.386
别小看我
I might surprise you.


365
00:32:15.334 --> 00:32:17.545
我一小时前就点了辣椒酱
I ordered my hot sauce an hour ago.


366
00:32:20.381 --> 00:32:21.799
能不能快点走？
Can we get going?


367
00:32:35.479 --> 00:32:36.564
拜托
Please?


368
00:32:37.231 --> 00:32:38.649
他要你亲眼看见
He wants you to see.


369
00:33:04.675 --> 00:33:06.510
然后再得到他要的
And he gets what he wants.


370
00:33:13.434 --> 00:33:15.436
他也有吃鳖的一天
Not always, apparently.


371
00:33:21.734 --> 00:33:24.236
安娜说我们要去庞贝看火山熔岩
Anna says we're going to Pompeii


372
00:33:27.407 --> 00:33:29.309
我也会去!
I'll be there, too!


373
00:33:48.344 --> 00:33:50.179
我就说别小看我
Told you I'd surprise you.


374
00:33:51.514 --> 00:33:53.891
-他很可爱 -他是我的一切
He's a cute kid. He's everything.


375
00:33:56.185 --> 00:33:57.812
那幅画在哪？
Where's the drawing?


376
00:33:57.978 --> 00:33:59.814
奥斯陆的机场
Oslo. At the airport.


377
00:33:59.980 --> 00:34:00.898
机场？
The airport?


378
00:34:01.565 --> 00:34:03.150
知道自由港是什么吗？
Do you know what a Freeport is?


379
00:34:04.235 --> 00:34:07.947
-专门储放艺术品的港口仓库 -尚未课税的艺术品
A storage facility for art that was acquired... But not yet taxed.


380
00:34:08.697 --> 00:34:10.741
我们建立了一个网络
We started a network.


381
00:34:11.117 --> 00:34:14.411
路特速营造公司负责盖仓库 我负责引进客户
Rotas, this construction company, built them. I brought in the clients.


382
00:34:14.495 --> 00:34:15.579
这些仓库是避税天堂
The facilities are tax havens.


383
00:34:15.663 --> 00:34:16.664
（自由港）

384
00:34:16.997 --> 00:34:19.417
客户可以看到他们的投资 却不必进口到国内
The clients can view their investments without importing them,


385
00:34:19.500 --> 00:34:21.293
这样就不必缴税
so they avoid paying tax.


386
00:34:21.377 --> 00:34:24.088
就像是艺术品的转机贵宾室？
It's sorta like a transit lounge for art?


387
00:34:24.171 --> 00:34:25.297
艺术品、古董
Art, antiquities.


388
00:34:25.464 --> 00:34:27.508
-任何贵重物品 -任何东西？
- Anything of value, really. - Anything?


389
00:34:27.591 --> 00:34:29.218
任何合法的东西
Anything legal.


390
00:34:29.301 --> 00:34:32.680
就像是瑞士银行系统 完全隐密
But it's not unlike the Swiss banking system. Opaque.


391
00:34:34.515 --> 00:34:37.977
你应该知道自由港多半只有仓库
As I'm sure you are aware, most Freeports are just warehouses.


392
00:34:38.060 --> 00:34:40.729
但我们能确保你能享受
But here we ensure that you can actually enjoy...


393
00:34:40.813 --> 00:34:43.190
路特速在奥斯陆自由港有仓库 我猜画在那里
Rotas has assets in the Oslo Freeport. I'm guessing it's there.


394
00:34:43.315 --> 00:34:45.317
保险库在这里
And this way to the vaults!


395
00:34:45.526 --> 00:34:47.278
-你猜？ -她猜的？
- Guessing? - Guessing?


396
00:34:47.445 --> 00:34:49.613
我们每年去那里四五次
We make trips there four, five times a year.


397
00:34:49.697 --> 00:34:51.532
-去看艺术品？ -还有去干他的勾当
- To view art? - And whatever it is he does.


398
00:34:52.199 --> 00:34:54.618
但艺术品对安德烈来说并不重要
Turns out art's of no importance to Andrei.


399
00:34:54.827 --> 00:34:56.370
自由港才重要
But the Freeports are.


400
00:34:58.038 --> 00:35:00.332
保险库是根据五角大厦结构建造
The structure of the vaults is based on the Pentagon.


401
00:35:00.416 --> 00:35:03.127
每个保险库都有独立的结构体
Each vault a separate structure within the others.


402
00:35:03.210 --> 00:35:05.880
破坏一个结构体不会影响其它的
Damage to one structure won't compromise the others.


403
00:35:09.425 --> 00:35:10.551
（火警）

404
00:35:17.349 --> 00:35:21.520
设有生物识别器 直接从
Some of our clients opt for biometric access, straight in...


405
00:35:23.022 --> 00:35:24.565
机场跑道进出
off the tarmac.


406
00:35:24.648 --> 00:35:25.900
从机场航厦？
From the terminal?


407
00:35:26.776 --> 00:35:28.736
从他们的私人飞机
From their private planes.


408
00:35:28.861 --> 00:35:29.862
当然了
Of course.


409
00:35:30.988 --> 00:35:34.992
我们的后勤部门 从世界其它自由港运送货物
Our logistics department ships to and from


410
00:35:37.119 --> 00:35:38.829
你想在那里找到什么？
What are you hoping to find in there?


411
00:35:38.913 --> 00:35:40.206
你真想知道？
You really wanna know?


412
00:35:40.456 --> 00:35:41.957
我不确定
I'm not sure.


413
00:35:42.124 --> 00:35:44.043
带一些防辐射手套
Bring some lead-lined gloves.


414
00:35:44.418 --> 00:35:47.171
天啊 是核武
Jesus.


415
00:35:49.917 --> 00:35:52.452
注意防火措施
pay attention to the fire precautions.


416
00:35:53.052 --> 00:35:55.721
-文件特别怕 -火灾？当然了
Documents are vulnerable to...


417
00:35:58.182 --> 00:36:00.226
我们不用洒水系统
We don't use sprinklers.


418
00:36:00.309 --> 00:36:03.062
仓库会灌满卤烷
The facility is flooded with halide gas,


419
00:36:03.145 --> 00:36:05.314
几秒内就能排除空气
displacing all the air within seconds.


420
00:36:06.398 --> 00:36:07.483
你能示范吗？
Can you show me?


421
00:36:07.566 --> 00:36:09.652
我们会窒息而死
If I did, we'd suffocate.


422
00:36:11.028 --> 00:36:12.154
员工呢？
What about the staff?


423
00:36:12.238 --> 00:36:15.658
卤烷只会灌满保险库 他们得逃进两边的走廊
Halide only fills the vaults, they just have to get into either corridor,


424
00:36:15.741 --> 00:36:17.743
而且会有10秒的警告
and there is a 10-second warning.


425
00:36:17.827 --> 00:36:19.912
至少你给他们10秒逃命
At least you give them 10 seconds.


426
00:36:19.995 --> 00:36:25.960
客户会用我们就是因为 他们的货比我们的命更值钱
Well, sir, our clients use us because we have no priorities above their property.


427
00:36:26.544 --> 00:36:27.420
真要命
Blimey.


428
00:36:27.503 --> 00:36:28.754
全都是防火门
All doors are fireproof.


429
00:36:28.921 --> 00:36:31.674
液压开关 简单的钥匙和电子触发器
Hydraulic closers, simple key and electronic triggers.


430
00:36:31.757 --> 00:36:33.634
全面封锁后要开启其实很容易
Surprisingly easy once there's a lockdown.


431
00:36:33.717 --> 00:36:35.094
为何会全面封锁？
Why a lockdown?


432
00:36:35.177 --> 00:36:37.930
电源安全开关会导致外门密封
Power switches to fail-safes, sealing the outer doors,


433
00:36:38.097 --> 00:36:40.683
但内门就回到原厂设定
but inner doors revert to factory settings.


434
00:36:41.725 --> 00:36:44.270
锁头很容易撬开 简直就是小儿科
And pickable locks.


435
00:36:50.067 --> 00:36:54.738
该怎么挟带重装武器 而不会触发封锁程序？
So, how do we get enough firepower through the perimeter to trigger the lockdown procedure?


436
00:36:56.323 --> 00:36:57.950
自由港的后墙
Back wall of the Freeport.


437
00:36:58.033 --> 00:36:59.326
你有点子？
You've got something?


438
00:37:00.077 --> 00:37:01.579
你不会喜欢
Not gonna like it.


439
00:37:02.371 --> 00:37:04.206
你想撞毁一架飞机？
You wanna crash a plane?


440
00:37:04.373 --> 00:37:06.625
又不是让它坠毁 没那么夸张
Well, not from the air. Don't be so dramatic.


441
00:37:06.792 --> 00:37:11.797
我要让一架喷射客机偏离跑道 撞上后墙引发一场大火
I want to run a jet off the taxiway and breach the rear wall and start a fire.


442
00:37:13.716 --> 00:37:15.301
多大的飞机？
Well, how big a plane?


443
00:37:16.010 --> 00:37:19.847
那部分就有点夸张了
Well, that part is a little dramatic.


444
00:37:20.639 --> 00:37:23.976
这是米耶 他的小组会搞定飞机
This is Mahir.


445
00:37:25.436 --> 00:37:26.979
挪威货运航空公司
Norsk Freight.


446
00:37:27.146 --> 00:37:29.398
他们使用自由港西侧的机库
They use the hangar on the west side of the Freeport.


447
00:37:29.482 --> 00:37:31.650
你要撞毁货机？机组员怎么办？
You want to crash a transport plane? What about the crew?


448
00:37:31.734 --> 00:37:33.569
解开逃生滑梯 让他们逃命
We pop the slides, chuck 'em off.


449
00:37:33.694 --> 00:37:34.862
在飞机滑行中？
On the move?


450
00:37:35.029 --> 00:37:36.822
有什么问题？他们不会有事
What's the problem? They'll be fine.


451
00:37:37.615 --> 00:37:39.283
这太胆大妄为了
Well, it seems bold.


452
00:37:39.450 --> 00:37:42.203
胆大妄为不错啊 我以为你会说疯狂
Bold I'm fine with. I thought you were gonna say nuts.


453
00:37:42.286 --> 00:37:43.370
被抓了怎么办？
And if you get caught?


454
00:37:43.454 --> 00:37:44.413
不会啦
We won't.


455
00:37:44.497 --> 00:37:45.790
万一呢？
And if you do?


456
00:37:46.540 --> 00:37:49.460
大家会以为是恐攻 但没人死亡
Everyone assumes terrorism, but no one's died,


457
00:37:49.543 --> 00:37:53.631
快速引渡后逃过牢狱之灾 根本就不会上新闻
so swift extradition then lost in the system. It'll barely make the news.


458
00:37:53.714 --> 00:37:55.925
这要看爆炸有多大
Oh, depends on the size of your explosion.


459
00:37:56.175 --> 00:37:58.511
其实金条一定会引起大骚动
Well, actually, the gold bars might get some play.


460
00:37:58.594 --> 00:37:59.720
金条？
Gold bars?


461
00:37:59.804 --> 00:38:02.056
挪威货运每月运送金条到国库
Norsk Freight ships Treasury gold once a month.


462
00:38:02.139 --> 00:38:04.517
炸掉后货舱 金条散落在跑道
Blow the back. Drop it out on the runway.


463
00:38:05.684 --> 00:38:09.063
我保证没人会注意仓库
No one will be looking at the building. I guarantee you.


464
00:38:12.149 --> 00:38:14.193
五角仓库的中央空间太大了
The space in the center of the pentagon is too big.


465
00:38:14.360 --> 00:38:15.611
那里有什么东西
There's something there.


466
00:38:16.403 --> 00:38:18.739
但查不出来 平面图上没记号
Can't figure it out, it's just not marked.


467
00:38:20.616 --> 00:38:21.826
45秒
That's 45 seconds.


468
00:38:21.992 --> 00:38:22.952
绰绰有余
Ample.


469
00:38:23.160 --> 00:38:24.495
你不是还得狂奔吗？
Won't you be running?


470
00:38:26.163 --> 00:38:28.916
好吧 换你了 开始打包
All right, it's your turn. Start packing.


471
00:38:47.328 --> 00:38:48.561
各位 请通过安检门
Gentlemen, if you would, through the detector, please.


472
00:38:52.022 --> 00:38:53.023
先生
Sir?


473
00:39:04.368 --> 00:39:06.954
请问要喝咖啡或水？
I can offer you, perhaps, a coffee, water?


474
00:39:07.037 --> 00:39:08.539
给我杯浓缩咖啡
No, I'll take an espresso.


475
00:39:08.706 --> 00:39:10.374
-您呢？ -不用 谢谢
- Sir? - No, thank you.


476
00:39:10.541 --> 00:39:12.084
太好了
Excellent.


477
00:39:21.051 --> 00:39:25.014
大家都吃素吗？我只有素食餐
Is everybody on this plane vegetarian? Because all I got here is vegetarian.


478
00:39:27.057 --> 00:39:29.435
那看起来像是肉
So that looks like meat,


479
00:39:29.518 --> 00:39:32.104
不过应该是素的 看起来都是素的
but I think that looks vegetarian. I think they both look vegetarian.


480
00:39:32.188 --> 00:39:34.356
我也不知道 我被搞混了
I don't really know. It's confusing, ya know?


481
00:39:35.191 --> 00:39:36.025
好吧
Okay.


482
00:39:43.407 --> 00:39:44.700
这里请 两位
This way, gentlemen.


483
00:40:00.841 --> 00:40:03.135
两位 你们的储藏室
Gentlemen, your assigned compartment.


484
00:40:13.729 --> 00:40:15.773
继续开 别用无线电
Carry on. Not the radio.


485
00:40:17.858 --> 00:40:21.570
（挪威货运）

486
00:40:54.228 --> 00:40:55.229
瑜珈
Yoga.


487
00:41:00.359 --> 00:41:02.236
快走 快啊
Let's go! Now!


488
00:41:32.725 --> 00:41:33.768
快点 快点
Go, go, go!


489
00:42:09.261 --> 00:42:10.513
好吧
Right. Um...


490
00:42:26.195 --> 00:42:28.405
你说10秒 对吧？
You said 10 seconds, right?


491
00:43:48.444 --> 00:43:50.154
这里有别人
There's someone in here with us.


492
00:43:54.784 --> 00:43:59.622
（路特速）

493
00:44:05.044 --> 00:44:07.338
-要帮忙吗？ -好啊
- Need a hand? - Actually, yes.


494
00:44:35.407 --> 00:44:36.408
别碰
Don't touch them!


495
00:44:37.326 --> 00:44:38.786
到底发生什么事？
The hell happened here?


496
00:44:44.375 --> 00:44:46.127
事情还没发生
It hasn't happened yet.


497
00:47:05.307 --> 00:47:06.475
别杀他
Don't kill him!


498
00:47:07.351 --> 00:47:09.645
我们得知道身分是否曝光
We need to know if we've been compromised.


499
00:47:11.772 --> 00:47:15.651
你为何在这里？你是谁？
Why are you here? Who are you?


500
00:47:16.402 --> 00:47:18.195
你怎么知道我们在这？
How'd you know we'd be here?


501
00:47:33.544 --> 00:47:35.171
我们得走了
We need to go.


502
00:47:40.342 --> 00:47:42.344
另一个家伙怎么了？
What happened to the other guy?


503
00:47:42.970 --> 00:47:45.055
搞定了
Took care of him.


504
00:47:59.695 --> 00:48:01.030
我看太多了
Well, I've seen too much.


505
00:48:01.113 --> 00:48:03.824
我还活着 这代表你决定信任我
I'm still alive, which must mean you've decided to trust me.


506
00:48:03.991 --> 00:48:05.701
也许我不够狠
Or maybe I lost my edge.


507
00:48:05.868 --> 00:48:07.453
你还是够狠
Edge is still intact.


508
00:48:09.538 --> 00:48:11.165
发生一场冷战
There's a cold war.


509
00:48:11.665 --> 00:48:12.583
核战？
Nuclear?


510
00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:14.251
时间战争
Temporal.


511
00:48:15.628 --> 00:48:16.545
时空旅行？
Time travel?


512
00:48:16.712 --> 00:48:17.630
不
No.


513
00:48:18.130 --> 00:48:21.008
能够逆转物质中熵的科技
Technology that can invert an object's entropy.


514
00:48:22.009 --> 00:48:23.552
你是指逆转时间
You mean reverse chronology.


515
00:48:24.639 --> 00:48:26.908
就像费曼与惠勒的理论 正子只是时间逆行的电子？
Like Feynman and Wheeler's notion that a positron is an electron


516
00:48:29.350 --> 00:48:32.311
-我是物理硕士 -那就试着跟上罗
I have a master's in physics.


517
00:48:34.105 --> 00:48:35.147
必须完全保密
Beyond secret.


518
00:48:35.231 --> 00:48:36.524
那为何找我来？
Then why'd you bring me in?


519
00:48:37.619 --> 00:48:40.020
我以为只会找到一幅画和几盒子弹
I thought we'd find a drawing and a couple boxes of bullets.


520
00:48:39.527 --> 00:48:41.153
我比你更惊讶
Not as surprised as I was.


521
00:48:41.320 --> 00:48:44.198
我要回孟买问个明白
I'm going back to Mumbai to get some answers.


522
00:48:45.199 --> 00:48:48.369
我会让你当中间人 但是记住 对你来说
I'll set you up as a go-between. But remember, to you...


523
00:48:49.411 --> 00:48:51.831
任务是找到钚元素
it's all about plutonium.


524
00:48:51.914 --> 00:48:53.624
任务完成后 他们会杀你灭口
And when we're done, they'll kill you.


525
00:48:53.707 --> 00:48:55.960
你不是会杀我灭口吗？
Won't you have to do that anyway?


526
00:48:56.502 --> 00:48:58.129
我宁愿自己做决定
I'd rather it be my decision.


527
00:48:58.421 --> 00:48:59.463
我也是
So would I.


528
00:49:00.131 --> 00:49:01.132
希望啦
I think.


529
00:49:13.185 --> 00:49:14.019
你干的？
Your work?


530
00:49:14.103 --> 00:49:14.937
（运送金条货机撞毁）

531
00:49:16.647 --> 00:49:18.399
你在保险库找到什么？
What did you find in the vaults?


532
00:49:18.566 --> 00:49:21.485
两个敌人 其中一个逆行
Two antagonists. One inverted.


533
00:49:21.569 --> 00:49:25.281
我们除掉那个正常的 但逆行的逃走了
We took out the regular one, but the inverted one got away.


534
00:49:25.531 --> 00:49:26.949
两人同时出现？
Both emerged at the same moment?


535
00:49:27.032 --> 00:49:28.033
对
Yeah.


536
00:49:28.701 --> 00:49:30.536
他们是同一个人
They were the same person.


537
00:49:31.412 --> 00:49:33.456
萨托在保险库装了一道逆转门
Sator's built a turnstile in that vault.


538
00:49:33.539 --> 00:49:34.665
逆转门？
Turnstile?


539
00:49:34.790 --> 00:49:37.209
逆转时间的机器
A machine for inverting.


540
00:49:37.376 --> 00:49:40.004
你告诉我那项科技还没有被发明
You've told me that technology hasn't been invented yet.


541
00:49:40.171 --> 00:49:42.631
是没有 是未来的人给他的
It hasn't.


542
00:49:44.508 --> 00:49:46.635
你有机会查个明白
You have the best chance of finding out.


543
00:49:47.845 --> 00:49:49.597
-见到他了吗？ -差一点

544
00:49:52.433 --> 00:49:53.642
像是什么？
Such as?


545
00:49:53.726 --> 00:49:55.853
钚241
Plutonium-241.


546
00:49:55.936 --> 00:49:59.190
萨托试图从中情局小队那里 抢走唯一没登记的钚241
Sator tried to lift the only loose 241 from under a CIA team


547
00:49:59.273 --> 00:50:01.776
就是那次基辅歌剧院突击行动
at the opera siege in Kiev.


548
00:50:01.859 --> 00:50:04.653
他杀了小队 但没拿到钚241
He got the team.


549
00:50:05.863 --> 00:50:07.782
乌克兰国家安全局
Ukrainian Security Services.


550
00:50:07.865 --> 00:50:10.117
一周内会运到塔林
It's moving to Tallinn in a week.


551
00:50:10.367 --> 00:50:15.289
帮助军火商窃取武器级钚元素 是绝不能容许的 普莉亚
Helping an arms dealer steal weapons-grade plutonium is unacceptable, Priya.


552
00:50:15.664 --> 00:50:17.249
我只要把他干掉就行
I'm just gonna take him out.


553
00:50:17.333 --> 00:50:19.668
不行 萨托必须活着
No, no, no. Sator has to stay alive.


554
00:50:19.835 --> 00:50:22.463
直到我们知道他到底扮演什么角色
He has to stay alive until we know his part in things.


555
00:50:22.630 --> 00:50:26.383
趁机查明真相 但不能失去钚241
Leverage the situation, without losing control of the 241.


556
00:50:26.467 --> 00:50:27.843
太危险了
It's too dangerous.


557
00:50:28.010 --> 00:50:30.304
恐怖份子的核弹 就算能杀死数十亿人口
A terrorist's bomb, even one that can kill billions,


558
00:50:30.471 --> 00:50:33.140
但若不能阻止萨托 后果远比那更严重
is nothing compared with what will happen if we don't stop Sator.


559
00:50:33.307 --> 00:50:34.892
阻止他做什么？
From doing what?


560
00:50:35.059 --> 00:50:38.687
我们遭到来自未来的攻击
We are being attacked by the future.


561
00:50:39.855 --> 00:50:43.234
萨托在帮助他们 你得查出他的方法
And Sator's helping. You have to find out how.


562
00:50:58.958 --> 00:51:01.335
我看到奥斯陆的新闻 拿到画了吗？
I saw the news from Oslo. Do you have the drawing?


563
00:51:01.419 --> 00:51:03.087
你不必再担心了
You don't have to worry about it anymore.


564
00:51:03.254 --> 00:51:04.880
你毁了那幅画？
You destroyed it?


565
00:51:05.464 --> 00:51:07.258
我觉得你不会想要拿回来
I didn't think you'd want it back.


566
00:51:07.425 --> 00:51:08.384
他知道吗？
Does he know?


567
00:51:08.551 --> 00:51:10.052
还不知道 你先耐心等待
Not yet. So sit tight.


568
00:51:10.136 --> 00:51:11.178
耐心等待？
Sit tight?


569
00:51:12.674 --> 00:51:14.742
我儿子和那禽兽相处愈久 就会愈来愈疏远我
Every day my son spends with that monster, he thinks a little less of me.


570
00:51:14.390 --> 00:51:18.018
你不会等太久的 尽快把我介绍给他
It won't be long. In the meantime, introduce me.


571
00:51:18.519 --> 00:51:19.520
以什么身分？
As what?


572
00:51:20.948 --> 00:51:23.017
前任美国驻利雅德大使馆一等秘书
I'm a former first secretary from the American Embassy in Riyadh.


573
00:51:22.690 --> 00:51:24.191
我们去年6月在宴会上认识
We met at a party last June.


574
00:51:24.358 --> 00:51:26.110
我们在利雅德参加过宴会 但不是在6月
We were at a party in Riyadh, but I don't think it was in June.


575
00:51:26.193 --> 00:51:28.446
6月29日 7点或7点半
It was June 29th. 7:00 or 7:30.


576
00:51:28.612 --> 00:51:31.282
菜单上是鲑鱼 那晚改成鲈鱼
Salmon was on the printed menu. Swapped for sea bass on the night.


577
00:51:31.449 --> 00:51:33.159
萨托提早离开 他走后我们才认识
Sator left early. That's when we met.


578
00:51:33.325 --> 00:51:36.412
后来我去伦敦的薛普利拍卖行 你在这里遇见我
I came into Shipley's in London. You ran into me here


579
00:51:36.579 --> 00:51:38.122
想带我看你的游艇
and wanna show me your yacht.


580
00:51:38.330 --> 00:51:39.999
他会以为我们搞外遇
He'll think we're having an affair.


581
00:51:40.583 --> 00:51:41.667
那他会更想见我
Then he'll wanna meet me.


582
00:51:41.751 --> 00:51:42.710
或是杀了你
Or have you killed.


583
00:51:42.877 --> 00:51:45.004
这一点不用你担心
Let me worry about that.


584
00:51:45.296 --> 00:51:46.964
我看起来担心吗？
Did I look worried?


585
00:51:49.143 --> 00:51:50.410
除了船员能睡70人 包括两架直升机 防御飞弹
Sleeps 70 with crew.


586
00:51:52.595 --> 00:51:53.971
怕海盗吗？
Two helicopters. Missile defenses. Afraid of pirates?


587
00:51:54.138 --> 00:51:58.434
安德烈和黑白两道打交道 得罪两边 这就是避难所
Andrei lives playing one government off the other.


588
00:51:58.726 --> 00:51:59.769
我能跟你上船吗？
The day they turn, that's his refuge. May I join you?


589
00:51:59.852 --> 00:52:02.438
瓦克夫不见得会允许
Not sure Volkov's taking passengers just now.


590
00:52:02.521 --> 00:52:04.190
那就搭我的船
Then we'll take mine.


591
00:52:38.140 --> 00:52:39.141
麦斯
Max!


592
00:52:40.851 --> 00:52:42.853
那个美国人是谁？

593
00:52:44.438 --> 00:52:45.689
是个朋友

594
00:52:45.773 --> 00:52:47.566
他去过拍卖行
The man from Shipley's.


595
00:52:48.651 --> 00:52:50.903
你想找人痛扁他
Who you tried to have beaten up.


596
00:52:52.029 --> 00:52:54.406
我再问一次 他是谁？
I ask again, who is he?


597
00:52:57.076 --> 00:52:59.829
我们去年6月 在利雅德美国大使馆认识
We met in Riyadh last June at the American Embassy.


598
00:52:59.912 --> 00:53:02.164
这个外交官的身手不错嘛
Good with fists for a diplomat.


599
00:53:02.331 --> 00:53:04.333
你的疑心病太重了 安德烈
Paranoia's your department, Andrei.


600
00:53:04.500 --> 00:53:07.628
他人很好 我邀他来共进晚餐

602
00:53:09.130 --> 00:53:12.007
他去了庞贝和赫库兰尼姆
He's visiting Pompeii and Herculaneum.


603
00:53:12.466 --> 00:53:16.262
你就把他送走？我答应陪他去的
You just sent him off? I promised him I'd go with him.


604
00:53:16.720 --> 00:53:18.764
我跟他说你在忙
I explained you were busy.


605
00:53:20.307 --> 00:53:22.643
忙着陪朋友
With your friend.


606
00:53:43.998 --> 00:53:48.002
别乱摸 要摸也得先请我吃晚饭
Hey, easy, fella. Where I'm from, you buy me dinner first.


607
00:53:58.679 --> 00:54:00.598
-萨托先生 -省省吧

告诉我你上了我老婆没有

老死

613
00:54:14.195 --> 00:54:16.614
你挑错行业了
You chose the wrong profession.

前面有一座有围墙的花园 我们要带你去 割断你咽喉
There's a walled garden up the road. We are going to take you there, cut your throat.


615
00:54:22.870 --> 00:54:25.790
不是横割 是在中间割出一个洞
Not across. In the middle, like a hole.


616
00:54:25.956 --> 00:54:30.461
然后割下你的蛋 塞进洞里面 塞爆气管
Then we take your balls and we stuff them in the cut,block the windpipe.


617
00:54:30.878 --> 00:54:31.796

Complex.


618
00:54:31.879 --> 00:54:35.174
看着你讨厌的人在窒息而死之前

Is this how you treat all your guests?


621
00:54:40.805 --> 00:54:42.306
话讲完了
We're finished.


622

624
00:54:55.486 --> 00:54:56.695
这里不好讲话
Not here.


625
00:55:00.157 --> 00:55:01.117
会驾帆船吗？
You sail?


626

629
00:55:21.679 --> 00:55:23.931
麦斯今年缺课太多次了
Max has missed too much school this year.


630
00:55:24.014 --> 00:55:27.184
我要带他回英国 学校不会容许他缺课这么多
I'm taking him back to England.


631
00:55:30.062 --> 00:55:31.814
你虽然富可敌国
You have all the trappings of a king.


632
00:55:31.897 --> 00:55:34.608
但只是在玩权力游戏的奸诈小人
We both know you're a grubby little man playing power games

637
00:55:52.334 --> 00:55:54.712
你担心那幅画被毁了？
Were you worried it had been destroyed?


638
00:55:54.795 --> 00:55:57.923
放心 我的直觉告诉我 把它从保险库拿出来
Rest assured, instinct told me to remove it from the vault.


639
00:55:59.133 --> 00:56:01.802
我对未来总是有敏锐的直觉
I've always had instincts about the future.


640
00:56:03.304 --> 00:56:06.724

那座基地被夺回来
When the station was retaken,


647
00:57:17.002 --> 00:57:20.673
但核弹弹头的钚241 却少了3/4公斤

648
00:57:24.802 --> 00:57:26.679
丢失的钚241

我不会跟你合伙

654
00:57:55.916 --> 00:57:59.044
你懂得怎么自保 没留下任何纪录
You can take care of yourself. You have no record.


655
00:58:00.337 --> 00:58:04.175
受过训练的军火商 知道怎么掩盖自己的痕迹
Someone in the arms trade, with training, who knows how to cover his tracks.


656
00:58:04.258 --> 00:58:05.509

你不能这样驾船

665
00:58:57.269 --> 00:58:58.562
我不是你想的那种人
I'm not who you think I am.


666

我知道 他给我看了那幅画

我不知道你以为你先生在做什么
I don't know what you think your husband does...


669
00:59:07.154 --> 00:59:09.573
大家都知道他是军火商
Oh, we both know he's an arms dealer.


670
00:59:09.698 --> 00:59:10.908

00:59:27.466 --> 00:59:28.467
现在
Now.


676
00:59:29.760 --> 00:59:31.762
他要看到我没穿裤子？
Uh, he wants to see me without pants?


677
00:59:37.726 --> 00:59:38.644
相信我
- Trust me. - Save it.


678
00:59:40.080 --> 00:59:42.349
省省吧 我不会再上第二次当
I'm not falling for it twice.


679
00:59:43.941 --> 00:59:45.401
你有更好的选择？
You have a better option?


680
00:59:48.279 --> 00:59:50.239
你会不择手段得到你要的
Whatever it takes to get what you want.


681
00:59:50.322 --> 00:59:52.825
根本不会管我跟儿子的死活
Not a second's thought for me or my son.


682
00:59:57.413 --> 00:59:59.665
你觉得他会怎么对付我？
What do you think he's gonna do to me now?


683
01:00:11.135 --> 01:00:12.553
尽量别用它
Try not to use it.


684
01:00:14.597 --> 01:00:16.223
别对任何人开枪
On anyone.


685
01:00:21.729 --> 01:00:22.980
够了
Enough.


686
01:00:26.734 --> 01:00:29.528
瞧 我和年轻小伙子一样健康
See? Pulse of a man half my age.


687
01:00:32.782 --> 01:00:34.408
陪我喝酒
Drink with me.


688
01:00:36.410 --> 01:00:38.412
看来我欠你一条命
It seems I now owe you my life.


689
01:00:38.788 --> 01:00:39.789
小事一件
It's nothing.


690
01:00:39.955 --> 01:00:41.749
我的命可不是小事
My life is not nothing.


691
01:00:41.832 --> 01:00:44.335
我也不喜欢亏欠别人
And I don't like to be in debt.


692
01:00:44.710 --> 01:00:48.714
那就回报我 别报复你老婆
Then pay me. No retribution against your wife.


693
01:00:52.093 --> 01:00:54.553
你以为是她松开我的安全索？
You think she released my harness?


694
01:00:57.848 --> 01:00:59.642
那是我自己的错
It was my own mistake.


695
01:01:00.309 --> 01:01:02.228
那就帮我偷走钚241
Then help me steal the 241.


696
01:01:02.311 --> 01:01:04.730
我需要资源 那是武器化的钚元素
I need resources. It's weapons-grade plutonium.


697
01:01:04.814 --> 01:01:06.816
必须小心处理 也需要封隔设施
That means special handling, containment facilities...


698
01:01:06.899 --> 01:01:08.317
我很清楚
I know what it means.


699
01:01:10.486 --> 01:01:13.489
你要教我幅射的危险？
You lecture me about radiation?


700
01:01:14.448 --> 01:01:16.367
安德烈萨托
Andrei Sator,


701
01:01:16.534 --> 01:01:21.080
从年少就在废墟中挖掘钚元素
digging plutonium from the rubble of my city as a teenager.


702
01:01:21.247 --> 01:01:22.081
在哪里？
Where?


703
01:01:24.875 --> 01:01:26.794
史托斯克12市
Stalsk-12.


704
01:01:28.295 --> 01:01:29.296
我的家乡
My home.


705
01:01:32.466 --> 01:01:36.804
一枚核弹在地面引爆 碎片四处散落
One part of a warhead exploded at ground level, scattering the others.


706
01:01:38.514 --> 01:01:40.975
政府需要有人找到钚元素
They needed people to find the plutonium.


707
01:01:43.144 --> 01:01:46.647
那是我第一笔生意 没人敢竞标
It became my first contract.


708
01:01:46.730 --> 01:01:48.732
他们都觉得必死无疑
Nobody else even bid. They thought it was a death sentence.


709
01:01:51.360 --> 01:01:52.361
但是
But...


710
01:01:54.238 --> 01:01:56.949
一个人死亡的可能
one man's probability of death...


711
01:01:57.116 --> 01:01:58.826
（安德烈萨托）

712
01:01:58.993 --> 01:02:03.330
却是另一个人存活的可能
...is another man's possibility for a life.


713
01:02:05.416 --> 01:02:08.085
我在全新俄罗斯占有一席之地
I staked my claim in the new Russia.


714
01:02:09.044 --> 01:02:12.882
直到现在 只有我的公司能在废墟中作业
Even now, my company is the only one to operate in the ruins.


715
01:02:13.883 --> 01:02:16.886
钚241经由欧洲北部被运送到
The 241 is being transported through northern Europe,


716
01:02:17.052 --> 01:02:21.515
位于第里雅斯特的长期核武库
on its way to the long-term nuclear storage depot in Trieste.


717
01:02:22.433 --> 01:02:24.685
听说你在塔林有人脉
I'm told you have resources in Tallinn.


718
01:02:29.565 --> 01:02:31.734
留下来过夜
Stay with us tonight.


719
01:02:31.901 --> 01:02:33.527
我坚持
I insist.


720
01:03:01.013 --> 01:03:02.098
你想干嘛？
What do you want?


721
01:03:02.264 --> 01:03:04.266
好好谈谈今天的事
We're going to talk about today.


722
01:03:05.226 --> 01:03:06.227
才不要
No, we're not.


723
01:03:06.393 --> 01:03:07.394
不要？
No?


724
01:03:09.396 --> 01:03:10.439
走着瞧
We'll see.


725
01:03:11.107 --> 01:03:14.568
别以为你能像 对付别的女人一样对付我
Don't think for a second you can treat me like you treat your other women.


726
01:03:16.529 --> 01:03:18.447
那么
And, uh...


727
01:03:19.532 --> 01:03:23.911
你以为 我是怎么对付别的女人？
how do you imagine...I treat these other women, huh?


728
01:03:24.078 --> 01:03:26.539
我会逼她们乖乖说话？
You think I force them into conversation?


729
01:03:26.705 --> 01:03:29.875
你不想说没关系 用力咬着吧
You wanna be quiet, fine.You can bite down on that.


730
01:03:32.878 --> 01:03:36.424
就连你空洞的灵魂也需要填补
Even a soul as blank and brittle as yours needs a response.


731
01:03:37.967 --> 01:03:40.010
光是恐惧和痛苦够吗？
Is fear and pain enough, Andrei?


732
01:03:40.094 --> 01:03:41.470
我只能给你这些
That's all I have to offer you.


733
01:03:41.554 --> 01:03:43.097
那就够了
Well, that will have to do, then.


734
01:03:43.264 --> 01:03:45.850
你为什么不放过我？
Why didn't you just let me go?


735
01:03:46.016 --> 01:03:48.018
因为
Because...


736
01:03:50.062 --> 01:03:54.692
如果我不能拥有你
if I can't have you...


737
01:03:56.277 --> 01:03:58.779
别人也休想拥有你
no one else can.


738
01:04:00.114 --> 01:04:03.033
你敢碰我 我会叫到他听见
And if you touch me, I scream so loud he hears.


739
01:04:03.117 --> 01:04:04.994
我会让他插手吗？
You think I let him interfere?


740
01:04:05.077 --> 01:04:07.580
他敢的话 你就得杀了他
If he tried, you'd have to kill him.


741
01:04:07.663 --> 01:04:08.998
生意一笔勾销
End of deal.


742
01:04:10.624 --> 01:04:12.835
所以你最好别碰我
So you leave me alone.


743
01:04:14.837 --> 01:04:16.088
别来烦我
Not now!


744
01:06:35.936 --> 01:06:40.149
98下 扁人后脉博还这么稳真不赖
Ninety-eight. Not bad for such exertion.


745
01:06:51.702 --> 01:06:52.995
他在窗口偷看
He was at the window.


746
01:06:54.663 --> 01:06:55.915
我只是好奇
I was curious.


747
01:06:57.249 --> 01:07:00.127
你不该对我的货好奇
My property shouldn't concern you.


748
01:07:00.294 --> 01:07:01.879
你是什么人？
Who are you?


749
01:07:02.046 --> 01:07:04.215
怎会知道歌剧院的事？
How do you come by your information about the opera?


750
01:07:04.298 --> 01:07:08.552
你不会跟个不够聪明的 中情局干员做生意吧？
You wouldn't do business with someone who wasn't savvy enough to be recruited.


751
01:07:08.636 --> 01:07:11.722
中情局提供市场上2/3的核原料
Hell, the CIA provides two thirds of the market for fissile material.


752
01:07:11.806 --> 01:07:14.600
他们通常是买家 不是卖家
They're usually buying, not selling.


753
01:07:15.684 --> 01:07:18.229
但我们活在一个暮光世界
But we do live in a twilight world.


754
01:07:18.437 --> 01:07:20.022
惠特曼的诗句？很优美
Is that Whitman? Pretty.


755
01:07:20.106 --> 01:07:22.191
下一个警告就是脑袋吃子弹
Next warning's a bullet in the brain.


756
01:07:24.360 --> 01:07:25.861
不是咽喉里塞卵蛋？
No balls in my throat?


757
01:07:26.695 --> 01:07:30.407
到了塔林就没有时间搞这种事
There will be no time for such things... in Tallinn.


758
01:07:31.117 --> 01:07:34.620
你设法去那里 我要瓦克夫加入你小组
You make your way there. I want Volkov on your team.


759
01:07:34.912 --> 01:07:35.955
办不到
No.


760
01:07:39.250 --> 01:07:42.753
我负责偷货 你负责给钱
I spring the material. You pay me off.


761
01:07:42.837 --> 01:07:44.422
你太太负责交易
Your wife does the exchange.


762
01:07:44.505 --> 01:07:46.048
我从不让她涉入我的生意
I never involve her in my business.


763
01:07:46.132 --> 01:07:47.800
所以我才信任她
Yeah, that's why I trust her.


764
01:07:48.217 --> 01:07:49.718
送他上岸
Put him ashore.


765
01:07:50.219 --> 01:07:51.470
我要怎么联络你？
How do I contact you?


766
01:07:51.554 --> 01:07:52.471
你不能
You don't.


767
01:07:52.555 --> 01:07:54.223
你要怎么付我头期款？
How do you advance me the funds?


768
01:07:58.102 --> 01:08:01.063
你最好别把钚元素掉地上
Handle the plutonium better than that.


769
01:08:11.115 --> 01:08:12.408
金条上面发现什么？
What did you find on the gold?


770
01:08:12.491 --> 01:08:14.493
没印记、没模具痕迹 啥都没有
No franks, no mold marks. Nothing.


771
01:08:14.577 --> 01:08:16.537
-哪儿来的？ -情报点
- How? - Dead drops.


772
01:08:17.079 --> 01:08:20.082
他埋下时空胶囊 传送位置
He buries his time capsule, transmits the location,


773
01:08:20.249 --> 01:08:23.502
然后挖出未来送来的逆转物品
then digs it up to collect the inverted materials they sent.


774
01:08:23.794 --> 01:08:26.630
一瞬间就送到 他埋在哪里？
Seemingly instantaneous. Where's he bury it?


775
01:08:26.797 --> 01:08:29.717
几世纪都不会被发现的地方
Some place that won't be discovered for centuries.


776
01:08:29.884 --> 01:08:31.761
土壤分析显示什么？
What did the soil samples show?


777
01:08:31.969 --> 01:08:35.556
欧洲北部 亚洲 有放射性
Northern Europe, Asia.


778
01:08:39.310 --> 01:08:40.519
为何找我来？
Why am I here?


779
01:08:40.603 --> 01:08:43.814
我不信任别人进行监定
I don't trust anyone else to assess the pieces.


780
01:08:44.607 --> 01:08:46.817
车队会经过市区 你觉得怎样？
Via convoy through downtown, what's the thinking?


781
01:08:47.276 --> 01:08:50.112
马路太拥挤 车况很难预料
Crowded. Unpredictable traffic patterns.


782
01:08:50.196 --> 01:08:52.281
几乎不可能策划突袭行动
It's almost impossible to plan an ambush.


783
01:08:52.448 --> 01:08:54.074
说得有道理
They have a point.


784
01:08:54.742 --> 01:08:56.243
他们从空中监视车队？
Is the convoy monitored from the air?


785
01:08:56.327 --> 01:08:59.997
GPS定位 转错一个弯 大队人马就会赶来
Tracked by GPS. One wrong turn, in come the cavalry.


786
01:09:00.080 --> 01:09:01.332
我们需要重装武器
We need big guns.


787
01:09:01.415 --> 01:09:03.834
可以展示武力 也不必开火
Guns that make the point without being fired.


788
01:09:03.918 --> 01:09:06.003
还需要低调的飙速快车
We need a fast car that doesn't look fast. Four heavy vehicles.


789
01:09:06.087 --> 01:09:08.506
四台不一样的重型车辆

790
01:09:12.218 --> 01:09:15.429
最重要的是绝对不能留下任何纪录
Most of all, we have to set this up with nothing in the record.


791
01:09:15.513 --> 01:09:17.389
电子和纸本都不行
Nothing electronic, nothing paper.


792
01:09:17.556 --> 01:09:21.685
把货偷走后不能让萨托突袭我们
I don't want Sator ambushing us once we spring the material.


793
01:09:21.852 --> 01:09:24.480
他被蒙在鼓里我们才安全
His ignorance is our only protection.


794
01:09:28.317 --> 01:09:32.321
（自由港）

795
01:10:02.059 --> 01:10:03.310
看到吗 凯特？
You see, Kat?


796
01:10:04.270 --> 01:10:06.522
一些我的最爱
Some of my favorites.


797
01:10:08.065 --> 01:10:12.903
被烧过但仍能用 对吧？
Singed but, uh, salvageable, wouldn't you say?


798
01:10:12.987 --> 01:10:14.905
那不是我的专长
- That's not my area of expertise.


799
01:10:16.150 --> 01:10:20.520
没错 你跟这种事不会有关系
Ah, that's right.You would never have anything to do with such things.


800
01:10:20.035 --> 01:10:22.496
但我们的世界在此碰撞
But this is where our worlds collide.


801
01:10:22.663 --> 01:10:24.290
这是什么 安德烈？
What is this, Andrei?


802
01:10:24.457 --> 01:10:27.418
你心知肚明 凯特
You know perfectly well what it is, Kat.


803
01:10:30.254 --> 01:10:32.047
这门肮脏龌龊的生意
The filthy business


804
01:10:32.131 --> 01:10:35.634
让你穿得光鲜亮丽 也让我们儿子念名校
that put those clothes on your back and our boy in his school,


805
01:10:35.718 --> 01:10:38.220
你还以为是你靠关系得来的
that you thought you could negotiate your way around.


806
01:10:39.263 --> 01:10:41.265
车队10分钟后抵达市区

807
01:10:48.022 --> 01:10:49.231
该走了
Time to go.


808
01:10:49.315 --> 01:10:50.775
我才不会跟他走
I'm not going anywhere with him.


809
01:10:50.858 --> 01:10:52.193
看着我
Look at me!


810
01:10:53.444 --> 01:10:58.324
搞清楚一件事 你不能与虎谋皮
And understand, you don't negotiate with a tiger.


811
01:10:58.491 --> 01:11:02.495
只能欣赏他 直到他反扑
You admire a tiger until he turns on you


812
01:11:02.661 --> 01:11:07.082
就会知道他有多威猛
and you feel its true fucking nature!


813
01:11:07.416 --> 01:11:08.667
别过来
Don't.


814
01:11:09.710 --> 01:11:11.754
给我待在那里
You stay right there.


815
01:11:15.341 --> 01:11:17.718
绿组 两分钟
Green. Two minutes.


816
01:11:41.283 --> 01:11:42.576
你不会杀我
You are not going to kill me.


817
01:11:42.660 --> 01:11:44.411
我已经试过了
I already tried.


818
01:11:44.495 --> 01:11:48.124
你只敢把我推下船 而没胆冷血拿枪杀我
You pushed me off a boat. You are not going to shoot me in cold blood.


819
01:11:48.290 --> 01:11:50.501
我的血在沸腾 安德烈
My blood's not cold, Andrei.


820
01:11:50.668 --> 01:11:53.796
对 但你不够愤怒
No, but you're not angry enough.


821
01:11:55.589 --> 01:11:58.968
因为愤怒会变成绝望
Because anger scars over into despair.


822
01:12:01.053 --> 01:12:03.264
我看着你的双眼
I look in your eyes...


823
01:12:04.765 --> 01:12:06.392
只看到绝望
I see despair.


824
01:12:10.187 --> 01:12:13.399
贱女人 只会靠我养
Vengeful bitch! Living off me!


825
01:12:13.566 --> 01:12:16.735
我还以为你没这么贱 够了
Thinking that you're better! Enough!


826
01:12:40.843 --> 01:12:43.554
告诉我发生的一切
Tell me everything as it happens.


827
01:12:45.806 --> 01:12:47.767
把我锁在这一边
Seal me this side.


828
01:13:04.992 --> 01:13:07.286
黄组 60秒
Yellow, 60 seconds.


829
01:13:07.453 --> 01:13:08.996
60秒 收到

830
01:13:23.803 --> 01:13:26.222
蓝组 45秒
Blue, 45 seconds.


831
01:13:26.597 --> 01:13:28.224
蓝组 45秒 收到
Blue, 45, check.


832
01:13:44.740 --> 01:13:47.118
红组正开向你
Okay, Red. Coming to you.


833
01:13:56.794 --> 01:13:58.379
三台货车到位

834
01:14:02.466 --> 01:14:05.094
观察一切 向我回报
Watch everything. Give me all the details.


835
01:14:50.347 --> 01:14:51.724
大家准备好了吗？
All right, everyone set?


836
01:14:57.480 --> 01:14:59.482
5
And five...


837
01:15:00.357 --> 01:15:01.776
4
four...


838
01:15:02.735 --> 01:15:03.694
3
three...


839
01:15:04.820 --> 01:15:05.821
2
two...


840
01:15:07.990 --> 01:15:08.991
1
one.


841
01:15:31.722 --> 01:15:32.765
上吧 黄组
Go, Yellow!


842
01:15:36.435 --> 01:15:37.603
出了问题
We got a problem!


843
01:15:37.686 --> 01:15:40.731
我们需要支援 靠
Backup, we need backup! Shit!


844
01:15:52.201 --> 01:15:53.452
无线电失效

845
01:15:53.619 --> 01:15:55.788
他们还在移动吗？

846
01:17:47.191 --> 01:17:49.193
仔细听无线电对话
Check the radio chatter.


847
01:18:06.085 --> 01:18:09.922
我看过每种武器等级的容器 这不是其中之一
I've seen samples of encapsulation in every weapons class. This is not one of them.


848
01:18:10.089 --> 01:18:11.674
那就是他要的
That's what he's after.


849
01:18:15.469 --> 01:18:16.637
我听不懂
Can't understand this.


850
01:18:16.720 --> 01:18:18.305
你说你懂爱沙尼亚语
You said you spoke Estonian.


851
01:18:18.389 --> 01:18:22.184
这不是爱沙尼亚语 是倒着说的话
It's not Estonian. It's backwards.


852
01:18:26.188 --> 01:18:27.690
那是怎么回事？
The hell is that?


853
01:18:42.997 --> 01:18:44.331
快 快
Go, go, go!


854
01:19:30.878 --> 01:19:32.421
别交给他
Don't give it to him.


855
01:19:32.963 --> 01:19:36.050
-这不是钚元素 -这更可怕 该死
This isn't plutonium. It's worse than that, God damn it!


856
01:19:54.276 --> 01:19:55.319
抱歉
Sorry.


857
01:20:11.460 --> 01:20:12.545
他逃走了
He's getting away.


858
01:20:14.463 --> 01:20:15.673
他把她留在车上
He left her in the car!


859
01:20:15.756 --> 01:20:18.050
快追上她 快啊
Go after her, go! Go, go, go!


860
01:20:31.480 --> 01:20:32.690
开到旁边
Pull up alongside!


861
01:20:48.497 --> 01:20:50.833
快啊 靠近一点
Come on, come on. Closer!


862
01:20:54.712 --> 01:20:56.213
稳住 稳住
Keep it steady, keep it steady!


863
01:20:58.340 --> 01:20:59.925
快点
Hurry up!


864
01:21:01.427 --> 01:21:02.595
拜托
Please!


865
01:21:38.881 --> 01:21:41.467
别着急 我要呼叫救兵
All right, sit tight. I'm calling the cavalry.


866
01:21:42.301 --> 01:21:43.677
哪来的救兵？
What cavalry?


867
01:22:48.033 --> 01:22:50.202
你不说实话她就死
If you are not telling the truth, she dies.


868
01:22:52.830 --> 01:22:54.248
我不知道你在说什么
I don't know what you're talkin' about.


869
01:22:54.331 --> 01:22:56.459
你放在车上 不是消防车上 对吧？
You left it in the car, not the fire truck, right?


870
01:22:58.544 --> 01:22:59.712
谁跟你说的？
- Who told you that? - Just tell me now,


871
01:23:01.015 --> 01:23:02.282
老实说 真的在BMW车上吗？
is it really in the BMW?


872
01:23:03.007 --> 01:23:03.883
不知道
I don't know.


873
01:23:03.966 --> 01:23:05.634
你不说我就再开枪
Tell me or I'll shoot her again!


874
01:23:07.386 --> 01:23:08.387
放了她
Leave her alone!


875
01:23:08.554 --> 01:23:09.930
杀了他
Kill him!


876
01:23:10.097 --> 01:23:11.932
我没空跟你耗
I don't have time to negotiate.


877
01:23:17.521 --> 01:23:18.606
-听我说 -3
- Listen to me! - Three.


878
01:23:18.773 --> 01:23:19.690
我能帮你
I can help you.


879
01:23:19.857 --> 01:23:21.066
-救救我 -2
- Help me! - Two.


880
01:23:21.233 --> 01:23:22.193
拜托
Please!


881
01:23:22.359 --> 01:23:23.402
-不要 -1
- Don't! - One.


882
01:23:27.656 --> 01:23:29.450
下一枪就脑袋开花
Next one's a bullet to the head.


883
01:23:31.035 --> 01:23:32.536
-不 -1
- No! - One.


884
01:23:32.703 --> 01:23:34.246
2、3
Two. Three.


885
01:23:34.413 --> 01:23:35.581
好啦 好啦
Okay! Okay.


886
01:23:36.457 --> 01:23:41.170
-我放在那辆BMW上 -我们要检查是不是真的
The car. The BMW. I left it in the BMW. We're going to check this is real.


887
01:23:44.006 --> 01:23:45.174
在手套箱里
It's in the glove box!


888
01:23:46.175 --> 01:23:47.927
你放在哪里？
Where did you leave it?


889
01:23:48.969 --> 01:23:51.097
轿车或消防车 哪一台？
Car or fire truck, which one?


890
01:23:51.180 --> 01:23:53.641
你放在哪一台车上？ 我去之前得知道
Which vehicle did you leave it in? I need to know before I go out there.


891
01:23:53.724 --> 01:23:54.642
我告诉你了
I already told you.


892
01:23:56.185 --> 01:23:57.186
我相信你
I believe you.


893
01:23:57.561 --> 01:24:00.106
你要她 那就祝你们幸福
You wanted her here, I hope you'll be happy...


894
01:24:11.951 --> 01:24:13.119
安全
Clear!


895
01:24:13.619 --> 01:24:15.162
惠勒 检查另一边
Wheeler, go check the other side.


896
01:24:15.329 --> 01:24:16.580
你们两个
You two.


897
01:24:16.664 --> 01:24:17.832
他跑去哪了？
Where did he go?


898
01:24:18.082 --> 01:24:18.958
过去
The past.


899
01:24:42.106 --> 01:24:43.524
在手套箱里
It's in the glove box!


900
01:24:43.649 --> 01:24:46.026
我们要检查是不是真的
We're going to check this is real.


901
01:24:49.113 --> 01:24:51.657
-3、2、1 -好啦
- Three, two, one. - Okay, okay...


902
01:24:51.824 --> 01:24:54.076
下一枪就脑袋开花
Next one's a bullet to the head.


903
01:24:54.785 --> 01:24:57.037
-不 -1
- No! No! - One.


904
01:24:57.204 --> 01:24:58.706
-听我说 -2
- Listen to me. - Two.


905
01:24:58.956 --> 01:24:59.999
3
Three.


906
01:25:00.875 --> 01:25:01.876
我能帮你
I can help you.


907
01:25:02.042 --> 01:25:03.294
我没空跟你耗
I don't have time to negotiate.


908
01:25:04.044 --> 01:25:05.588
你不说我就再开枪
Tell me or I'll shoot her again.


909
01:25:06.714 --> 01:25:09.508
-放了她 -老实说 真的在BMW车上吗？
- Leave her alone! - Tell me now,


910
01:25:11.813 --> 01:25:14.247
你放在车上 不是消防车上 对吧？
You left it in the car, not the fire truck, right?


911
01:25:13.763 --> 01:25:15.055
谁跟你说的？
Who told you that?


912
01:25:15.556 --> 01:25:17.558
你不说实话她就死
If you're not telling the truth, she dies.


913
01:25:17.641 --> 01:25:19.393
我不知道你在说什么
I don't know what you're talking about.


914
01:25:31.781 --> 01:25:33.073
-医护人员 -到了
- Medic! - Check in.


915
01:25:34.533 --> 01:25:36.160
她遭到枪伤？
She's been shot?


916
01:25:36.494 --> 01:25:38.078
把她带回这一边
Bring her back, this side.


917
01:25:39.622 --> 01:25:41.457
她被逆转子弹射伤吗？
Was she shot with an inverted round?


918
01:25:46.754 --> 01:25:48.881
这是艾佛斯 他是自己人
This is Ives. He's one of us.


919
01:25:50.257 --> 01:25:52.134
自己人？这些人是谁？
"Us"! Who are these guys?


920
01:25:52.301 --> 01:25:54.386
普莉亚的人 我们的人
Priya's. Ours.


921
01:25:54.470 --> 01:25:56.055
萨托怎么会知道突袭行动？
How did Sator know about the ambush?


922
01:25:56.138 --> 01:25:57.431
有留下纪录
It's posterity.


923
01:25:58.626 --> 01:26:00.628
光天化日下的突袭行动 不可能没有纪录
An ambush in the middle of the street can't stay out of the records.


924
01:26:00.059 --> 01:26:03.145
屁啦 他知道我们的一举一动 每一个细节都知道
Bullshit! He knew every move we made! Every one of 'em.


925
01:26:03.229 --> 01:26:05.147
有人告密 是谁？是你吗？
Somebody talked. Who was it?


926
01:26:05.314 --> 01:26:06.232
不是
- Was it you? - No. No.


927
01:26:06.816 --> 01:26:11.695
你在每一个阶段都知道太多 我再问你一次
At every stage, you've known too much. I'm going to ask you again.


928
01:26:12.613 --> 01:26:14.615
你有没有告密？
Did you talk?


929
01:26:16.283 --> 01:26:20.287
没人告密 他们展开时间钳形攻势
Nobody talked. They're running a temporal pincer movement.


930
01:26:20.955 --> 01:26:22.081
什么？
A what?


931
01:26:22.248 --> 01:26:26.168
钳形攻势 不是空间 而是时间
The pincer movement. But not in space, in time.


932
01:26:26.836 --> 01:26:29.004
他一半的组员顺着时间前进
Half his team moves forward through the event.


933
01:26:29.088 --> 01:26:32.007
他先监控他们 最后再逆转时间展开攻击
He monitors them, and then attacks at the end moving backwards,


934
01:26:32.091 --> 01:26:33.551
那时他已知道一切
knowing everything.


935
01:26:33.634 --> 01:26:35.177
除了我把钚元素藏在哪里
Except for where I stashed the plutonium.


936
01:26:35.761 --> 01:26:37.596
那并不是钚元素 对吧？
Which isn't really plutonium, is it?


937
01:26:37.680 --> 01:26:41.434
我说过那是他要的东西 你也告诉他东西在哪
I told you it was what he was after. And you just told him where it was.


938
01:26:42.351 --> 01:26:43.727
我撒了谎
I lied.


939
01:26:45.563 --> 01:26:47.773
天啊 你连这件事也撒谎？
Jesus. You lied about it?


940
01:26:47.857 --> 01:26:51.110
他没办法在房间内确认 反正他还是会射杀她
He couldn't verify inside the room. He'd have shot her anyway.


941
01:26:52.236 --> 01:26:54.196
撒谎是标准行动程序
Lying is standard operating procedure.


942
01:26:54.321 --> 01:26:55.448
伤口扩散得太大
It's spread too far.


943
01:26:55.573 --> 01:26:56.866
什么意思？
Meaning what?


944
01:26:57.241 --> 01:26:58.367
她快死了
She's gonna die.


945
01:26:58.534 --> 01:27:00.119
标准行动程序
Standard operating procedure.


946
01:27:00.202 --> 01:27:02.121
救不了吗？我们不能做点什么？
Can't you help her? Can we do something?


947
01:27:02.204 --> 01:27:05.040
不能逆转病患然后稳定逆转辐射？
Can't we stabilize the inverse radiation by inverting the patient?


948
01:27:05.124 --> 01:27:06.250
要花好几天
Takes days.


949
01:27:06.333 --> 01:27:07.168
走吧
Let's go.


950
01:27:08.596 --> 01:27:10.932
我们几分钟前才掌控这台机器 之前是萨托的
We took control of this machine minutes ago. Before that, it's Sator's.


951
01:27:10.546 --> 01:27:12.590
她在这一边能活多久？
How long is she gonna live on this side?


952
01:27:12.757 --> 01:27:14.258
最多3个钟头
Three hours, tops.


953
01:27:14.425 --> 01:27:15.926
我要带她过去
I'm taking her through.


954
01:27:16.093 --> 01:27:18.179
我不会让她死 我愿意冒险
I'm not gonna let her die. I'll take my chances.


955
01:27:18.345 --> 01:27:20.306
没办法把你带回来
There's no way of bringing you back.


956
01:27:20.723 --> 01:27:22.141
我们会找到另一台机器
We find another machine.


957
01:27:22.224 --> 01:27:23.642
一星期前？在哪里？
A week ago? Where?


958
01:27:25.728 --> 01:27:27.229
奥斯陆
Oslo.


959
01:27:27.396 --> 01:27:31.150
那在机场安检范围内的仓库 闯不进去的
That facility's inside an airport security perimeter. It's impregnable.


960
01:27:32.359 --> 01:27:33.652
上个星期就可以
Mmm... It wasn't last week.


961
01:27:33.986 --> 01:27:36.864
我们要闯进去 你还会帮我们吧
We're going in. You might as well help us.


962
01:27:38.032 --> 01:27:40.785
这是反照窗 当你走向逆转门
This is a proving window. As you approach the turnstile,


963
01:27:40.868 --> 01:27:43.829
要是在反照窗内看不到自己 就别进去机器里
if you don't see yourself in the proving window,


964
01:27:44.830 --> 01:27:47.583
看不到逆行的自己走出逆转门 就代表你出不来
If you don't see yourself reverse-exit a machine,


965
01:27:50.628 --> 01:27:52.046
你自己看
See for yourself.


966
01:27:52.296 --> 01:27:54.090
这就是答案 走吧
There's your answer. Let's go.


967
01:28:18.906 --> 01:28:22.076
她慢慢稳定下来 伤口缝合了 只需要时间康复
She's stabilizing slowly. I'll clean and close, but the rest is time.


968
01:28:22.159 --> 01:28:23.410
需要多少时间？
How long does she need?


969
01:28:23.494 --> 01:28:25.788
4、5天 一星期最保险
Four, five days. A week to be sure.


970
01:28:27.039 --> 01:28:29.917
尼尔 设法带我们去奥斯陆 我要再出去
Hey, Neil. Find a way to get us to Oslo. I'm going back out there.


971
01:28:31.794 --> 01:28:32.920
去做什么？
To do what?


972
01:28:34.282 --> 01:28:36.117
阻止萨托拿着我给他的东西逃走
To stop Sator from getting away with whatever it is I just gave him.


973
01:28:35.798 --> 01:28:39.009
你没给他 你骗他东西在哪里 等等
You didn't. You lied about where it was. Wait.


974
01:28:39.593 --> 01:28:41.095
你是为了她回去
You're going out there for her.


975
01:28:41.178 --> 01:28:42.680
他在过去威胁要杀她
He threatened to kill her in the past.


976
01:28:42.763 --> 01:28:44.640
若真的下手 她现在会怎样？
If he does, what happens to her here?


977
01:28:45.933 --> 01:28:47.810
无从得知
That's unknowable.


978
01:28:47.893 --> 01:28:50.146
你若想去改变过去 就不是在这里观察后果
If you're there to make a change, you're not here to observe its effect.


979
01:28:50.229 --> 01:28:51.522
你相信什么？
What do you believe?


980
01:28:51.689 --> 01:28:53.816
发生过的已经发生了
What's happened's happened.


981
01:28:53.983 --> 01:28:56.777
我们必须在此时此刻救她
We need to save her, here and now.


982
01:28:56.944 --> 01:29:00.489
你若是再出去 就会双手奉上他要的东西
If you go back out there, you might hand him exactly what he's after.


983
01:29:00.656 --> 01:29:03.492
别让他们把她带回去 好吗？
Don't let them take her back through there.


984
01:29:06.495 --> 01:29:07.955
时间不多了
We don't have a lot of time.


985
01:29:08.122 --> 01:29:13.669
你何不替我们找个刚从奥斯陆运来 舒舒服服的货柜？
So why don't you find us a nice, cozy shipping container that's just come off a ship from Oslo?


986
01:29:13.753 --> 01:29:15.129
这么做太莽撞了
This is cowboy shit.


987
01:29:15.212 --> 01:29:17.882
你一旦走出那道门 就不知道会惹上什么麻烦
You have no idea what you're getting yourself into


988
01:29:20.009 --> 01:29:21.218
惠勒 告诉他
Wheeler, brief him.


989
01:29:21.802 --> 01:29:23.262
你会需要自己的氧气瓶
You'll need your own air.


990
01:29:23.429 --> 01:29:26.599
这里的氧气无法进入逆转的肺膜
Regular air won't pass through the membranes of inverted lungs.


991
01:29:26.766 --> 01:29:30.644
第一条规则 别接触顺时间前进的自己
Number one rule: don't come into contact with your forward self.


992
01:29:30.728 --> 01:29:33.355
所以才需要这些屏障和防护衣
It's the whole point of these barriers and protective suits.


993
01:29:33.439 --> 01:29:34.815
我们没有时间了
We don't have time.


994
01:29:34.899 --> 01:29:37.026
你的粒子若是接触到
Well, if your particles come into contact...


995
01:29:37.193 --> 01:29:38.110
会怎样？
What?


996
01:29:38.277 --> 01:29:39.236
全人类灭绝
Annihilation.


997
01:29:39.403 --> 01:29:41.280
那就糟糕了 对吧？
That would be bad, right?


998
01:29:41.447 --> 01:29:45.159
走出气闸后 花点时间适应环境
When you exit the air lock, take a moment to orient yourself.


999
01:29:45.326 --> 01:29:46.368
一切都会感觉很奇怪
Things will feel strange.


1000
01:29:47.745 --> 01:29:49.872
当你奔跑 风会从你后面吹来
When you run, the wind will be at your back.


1001
01:29:49.955 --> 01:29:54.835
当你碰到火 衣服上会结冰 因为热传导被逆转了
You encounter fire, ice will form on your clothes as the transfer of heat is reversed.


1002
01:29:54.919 --> 01:29:58.964
地心引力会是正常的 但周遭的世界将是逆转的
Gravity will feel normal but appear reversed for the world around you.


1003
01:30:00.007 --> 01:30:03.844
你的视觉和听觉会受到扭曲 这是正常的
You may experience distortions in your vision and hearing.


1004
01:30:05.971 --> 01:30:07.389
我不能保证你会有操控性
I can't vouch for the handling.


1005
01:30:07.473 --> 01:30:09.683
摩擦力和风阻都被逆转
Friction and wind resistance are reversed.


1006
01:30:09.809 --> 01:30:11.977
你也被逆转 但这世界并没有
You are inverted. The world is not.


1007
01:30:12.061 --> 01:30:13.687
收发器在公事箱上面吗？
Was the transponder on the case?


1008
01:30:13.854 --> 01:30:15.523
我们把它给丢了
We've tossed that case.


1009
01:30:15.606 --> 01:30:18.275
我逆向时间移动 所以必须遵循这个准则
I'm moving backwards. It's the ball I have to follow.


1010
01:30:18.359 --> 01:30:19.985
把追踪器给我
Give me the reader.


1011
01:30:24.073 --> 01:30:25.324
好吧
Okay.


1012
01:30:26.367 --> 01:30:27.660
准备好了吗？
You ready?


1013
01:31:57.625 --> 01:32:02.296
（追踪中）

1014
01:33:14.910 --> 01:33:16.120
（标准标记）

1015
01:33:19.540 --> 01:33:21.917
东西不在里面
The material's not in the case.


1016
01:33:22.835 --> 01:33:25.713
把演算机的其它部分带去震源
Get the other sections of the algorithm to the hypocenter.


1017
01:33:26.297 --> 01:33:29.508
他撒了谎 东西不在BMW上
He was lying. It wasn't in the BMW.


1018
01:33:29.592 --> 01:33:31.010
到底在哪里？
So, where is it?


1019
01:34:16.889 --> 01:34:18.974
我看到交换过程
I saw the handoff.


1020
01:34:19.141 --> 01:34:21.602
你害我白白射伤她
You made me shoot her for nothing.


1021
01:34:22.520 --> 01:34:26.315
你倒是让我的脉搏飙到130 没有人做到这一点
You did get my pulse above 130, no one's done that before.


1022
01:34:26.398 --> 01:34:28.067
就连我老婆也没有
Not even my wife.


1023
01:34:57.721 --> 01:35:00.266
艾佛斯和他的小组留下来清理现场
You left Ives and his team a hell of a cleanup.


1024
01:35:01.475 --> 01:35:03.561
热传导被逆转
Heat transfer was reversed.


1025
01:35:04.270 --> 01:35:08.399
你可能是史上第一个 因为爆炸导致失温的案例
You might be the first case of hypothermia from a gasoline explosion in history.


1026
01:35:09.275 --> 01:35:11.360
我已经见怪不怪了
At this point, nothing surprises.


1027
01:35:12.695 --> 01:35:14.071
我们正在回奥斯陆？
We're headed back to Oslo?


1028
01:35:14.155 --> 01:35:16.031
在路特速的货柜里
In a Rotas shipping container.


1029
01:35:16.407 --> 01:35:17.908
他拿到东西了 尼尔
He's got the material, Neil.


1030
01:35:18.325 --> 01:35:20.161
我双手奉上它
I handed it to him on a plate.


1031
01:35:20.953 --> 01:35:21.954
我警告过你
I warned you...


1032
01:35:22.037 --> 01:35:24.790
发生过的事已经发生了 我现在知道了
What's happened's happened. I get it now.


1033
01:35:24.874 --> 01:35:28.586
但我很难相信说话模棱两可的人
But it's hard to take things on trust from people speaking half-truths.


1034
01:35:28.669 --> 01:35:29.879
这么说不公平
That's not fair.


1035
01:35:29.962 --> 01:35:31.964
你在我们见面前就参一脚
You were a part of this before we met.


1036
01:35:32.214 --> 01:35:33.424
你替普莉亚工作？

1037
01:35:33.507 --> 01:35:34.467
不是
Were you working for Priya?


1038
01:35:36.844 --> 01:35:39.847
现在知道对你没啥好处
It can't possibly do you any good to know that right now.


1039
01:35:40.014 --> 01:35:44.852
等这一切过去 我们还活着 你也还在乎
When this is over, if we're still standing, and you still care,


1040
01:35:45.019 --> 01:35:47.646
我就告诉你我的人生故事
then you can hear my life story, okay?


1041
01:35:49.982 --> 01:35:51.650
很抱歉拖你下水
I'm sorry I involved you.


1042
01:35:51.859 --> 01:35:53.611
你得告诉我是怎么回事
You need to tell me what's going on.


1043
01:35:53.694 --> 01:35:56.405
尼尔知道的显然比我多
Apparently Neil here knows more about it than I do.


1044
01:35:56.572 --> 01:35:57.573
祝好运 老兄
Good luck, pal.


1045
01:35:58.859 --> 01:36:01.195
告诉凯特任何事 普莉亚就会认为她是风险
By telling Kat anything, we're compromising her in Priya's eyes.


1046
01:36:00.868 --> 01:36:03.245
普莉亚早就这么认为了
In Priya's eyes, she's already compromised.


1047
01:36:03.329 --> 01:36:05.706
她有权知道为何自己可能会死
She has the right to know why she might die.


1048
01:36:05.790 --> 01:36:06.874
我会死吗？
Am I gonna die?


1049
01:36:06.957 --> 01:36:08.542
我们能帮你就不会
Not if we have something to say about it.


1050
01:36:08.626 --> 01:36:09.627
我们能帮你
And we do.


1051
01:36:09.919 --> 01:36:11.378
你是谁？
Who are you?


1052
01:36:12.505 --> 01:36:16.008
先从简单的开始 每条物理定律
Let's start with the simple stuff. Every law of physics...


1053
01:36:22.264 --> 01:36:24.266
东西不在里面
The material's not in the case.


1054
01:36:24.433 --> 01:36:27.603
把演算机的其它部分带去震源
Get the other sections of the algorithm to the hypocenter.


1055
01:36:36.737 --> 01:36:37.780
你受伤了？
You injured?


1056
01:36:43.577 --> 01:36:45.579
演算机是什么 尼尔？
What's the algorithm, Neil?


1057
01:36:47.540 --> 01:36:50.626
钚241是九个部分的其中一个

1058
01:36:52.128 --> 01:36:56.549
那是以物体呈现的分子式 所以不会被复制或以语言传递
It's a formula rendered into physical form so it can't be copied or communicated.


1059
01:36:57.007 --> 01:36:59.260
那是只有一个功能的黑盒子
It's a black box with one function.


1060
01:36:59.552 --> 01:37:01.053
什么功能？
Which is?


1061
01:37:01.929 --> 01:37:04.682
逆转时间 但不是逆转物体或人
Inversion. But not objects or peoples.


1062
01:37:04.765 --> 01:37:06.016
而是我们周遭的世界
The world around us.


1063
01:37:06.100 --> 01:37:07.101
我不懂
I don't understand.


1064
01:37:08.262 --> 01:37:10.865
当他们逆转更多物体的熵
As they invert the entropy of more and more objects,


1065
01:37:10.438 --> 01:37:14.191
向前和向后的时间 就会愈来愈纠结
the two directions of time are becoming more intertwined.


1066
01:37:14.358 --> 01:37:17.403
但由于世界基本上还是向前运作
But because the environment essentially flows in our direction...


1067
01:37:17.611 --> 01:37:18.904
我们就能掌控时间
we dominate.


1068
01:37:18.988 --> 01:37:21.866
其他人总是逆流泅泳 那才救了你的命
They're always swimming upstream.


1069
01:37:24.910 --> 01:37:26.078
就像是迎风撒尿
Pissing in the wind.


1070
01:37:26.162 --> 01:37:29.165
演算机能够改变风向
And the algorithm can change the direction of that wind.


1071
01:37:29.248 --> 01:37:31.834
它能逆转全世界的熵
It can invert the entropy of the world.


1072
01:37:32.251 --> 01:37:33.377
那会怎样？
And if that happens?


1073
01:37:37.006 --> 01:37:39.091
游戏结束？能说得更清楚吗？
"End of play." Can you be a little more precise?


1074
01:37:39.258 --> 01:37:43.888
曾经活过的每个人和一切 都会立刻毁灭 够清楚了吧？
Everyone and everything that's ever lived, destroyed. Instantly.


1075
01:37:48.851 --> 01:37:51.937
你睡得越久 就会越快康复
The more you sleep, the faster you'll heal.


1076
01:38:07.745 --> 01:38:09.038
在货车上了
On a truck.


1077
01:38:11.415 --> 01:38:12.708
应该就快到了
Shouldn't be long now.


1078
01:38:14.001 --> 01:38:18.005
我一直在想 我们是他们的祖先
I've been thinking. We're their ancestors.


1079
01:38:18.089 --> 01:38:20.716
他们毁灭我们不也毁灭了自己？
If they destroy us, won't that destroy them?


1080
01:38:21.217 --> 01:38:23.302
这就要提到祖父悖论
This brings us to the grandfather paradox.


1081
01:38:23.469 --> 01:38:24.637
什么？
The what?


1082
01:38:25.513 --> 01:38:28.390
假如你回到过去把自己祖父杀掉
If you went back in time


1083
01:38:30.726 --> 01:38:31.644
答案是什么？
What's the answer?


1084
01:38:31.727 --> 01:38:33.312
没有答案 这是悖论
There's no answer. It's a paradox.


1085
01:38:33.896 --> 01:38:36.899
但是在未来 当权者显然相信你能
But in the future, those in power clearly believe that you can


1086
01:38:37.066 --> 01:38:40.152
把你祖父踢下楼梯 挖出他的眼珠
kick grandpa down the stairs, gouge his eyes out,


1087
01:38:40.319 --> 01:38:43.072
切断他的喉咙 却没有任何后果
slit his throat, without consequence.


1088
01:38:43.405 --> 01:38:45.032
他们有可能对吗？
Could they be right?


1089
01:38:45.199 --> 01:38:48.577
不重要 他们深信不疑
Doesn't matter. They believe it.


1090
01:38:48.661 --> 01:38:50.830
而且愿意毁灭我们
So they're willing to destroy us.


1091
01:38:52.581 --> 01:38:54.083
我要继续睡觉了
Can I go back to sleep now?


1092
01:38:54.166 --> 01:38:55.668
不行 我又想到另一件事
No. I thought of something else.


1093
01:38:55.751 --> 01:38:56.585
太好了
Great.


1094
01:38:56.752 --> 01:38:58.712
像这样逆转时间
This reversing the flow of time.


1095
01:38:58.796 --> 01:39:01.674
我们此刻身在此处 岂不代表从未发生？
Doesn't us being here now mean it never happens?


1096
01:39:01.757 --> 01:39:03.134
因为我们阻止了他们？
That we stop them?


1097
01:39:04.051 --> 01:39:05.886
乐观来说 我认为是对的
Optimistically, I'd say that's right.


1098
01:39:06.470 --> 01:39:07.680
悲观来说呢？
Pessimistically?


1099
01:39:07.763 --> 01:39:10.850
在平行世界理论中 我们不可能知道
In a parallel worlds theory, we can't know the relationship


1100
01:39:10.933 --> 01:39:13.686
意识和多重现实的关系
between consciousness and multiple realities.


1101
01:39:13.853 --> 01:39:15.104
你开始头痛了吗？
Does your head hurt yet?


1102
01:39:15.271 --> 01:39:16.439
当然
Yes.


1103
01:39:20.359 --> 01:39:21.819
试着睡觉吧
Try to sleep.


1104
01:39:36.834 --> 01:39:38.043
靠
Shit.


1105
01:39:39.462 --> 01:39:41.422
他们没载我们进去
They didn't take us inside.


1106
01:39:42.673 --> 01:39:44.300
该怎么办？
What do we do?


1107
01:39:47.678 --> 01:39:48.679
我们从破口进去
We use the breach.


1108
01:39:48.846 --> 01:39:51.098
撞上去后趁乱行动 准备好
The chaos right after impact. Get ready.


1109
01:39:53.934 --> 01:39:55.436
她的伤好了吗？
She healed enough?


1110
01:39:56.771 --> 01:39:59.690
不知道 我从来没做过这种事
I don't know. I've never done this before.


1111
01:40:00.357 --> 01:40:03.736
消防队来了 带凯特从破口进去
The fire crew's there.


1112
01:40:05.905 --> 01:40:07.448
你再带她进来
Then you bring her in.


1113
01:40:09.158 --> 01:40:10.159
你的伤怎样？
How's your arm?


1114
01:40:10.242 --> 01:40:11.702
不太妙
Not good.


1115
01:40:16.457 --> 01:40:18.209
听到引擎爆炸后马上行动
We move as soon as we hear the engines.


1116
01:40:22.713 --> 01:40:23.798
-等等 -怎么了？
- Hold on, hold on. - What?


1117
01:40:24.173 --> 01:40:25.091
你在流血
You're bleeding.


1118
01:40:25.883 --> 01:40:26.759
来 让我看看
All right, let me take a look at it.


1119
01:40:33.849 --> 01:40:34.850
好了吗？
Ready?


1120
01:41:07.842 --> 01:41:09.260
在这儿等 我要进去
Wait here. I'm going in.


1121
01:43:06.919 --> 01:43:07.753
快啊
Come on!


1122
01:43:08.254 --> 01:43:09.255
快走
Go, go, go!


1123
01:43:40.077 --> 01:43:40.911
快走
Go!


1124
01:45:22.555 --> 01:45:25.850
你明知是我从保险库出来 干嘛不说？
You knew it was me coming out of that vault.


1125
01:45:30.479 --> 01:45:33.482
事实不会改变 我知道你不会有事
Thing's the same, I knew you'd be okay.


1126
01:45:33.649 --> 01:45:35.192
发生过的已经发生了
What's happened's happened.


1127
01:45:35.276 --> 01:45:38.446
我若先说 你又改变作法 谁知道会怎样？
If I told you and you acted differently, who knows?


1128
01:45:40.197 --> 01:45:42.241
规定是不能说
The policy is to suppress.


1129
01:45:42.783 --> 01:45:44.493
谁规定的？
Whose policy?


1130
01:45:44.577 --> 01:45:45.870
我们啊 朋友
Ours, my friend.


1131
01:45:49.415 --> 01:45:52.501
我们要拯救走向灭亡的世界
We're the people saving the world from what might've been.


1132
01:46:02.178 --> 01:46:03.262
凯特
Kat?


1133
01:46:04.221 --> 01:46:05.473
我在这儿
I'm here.


1134
01:46:06.474 --> 01:46:09.310
伤疤会很大 你不会有事
It'll be quite a scar. You'll be okay.


1135
01:46:11.771 --> 01:46:12.730
搞定了
Did it.


1136
01:46:13.189 --> 01:46:14.440
搞定了什么？
You did what?


1137
01:46:15.149 --> 01:46:16.776
安德烈拿到演算机
Andrei has the algorithm.


1138
01:46:17.985 --> 01:46:19.737
你不知道他在哪里
You don't know where he is.


1139
01:46:21.906 --> 01:46:23.115
或哪个时空
Or when.


1140
01:46:24.492 --> 01:46:26.869
-把普莉亚带来奥斯陆 -为什么？
- Get Priya here to Oslo. - Why?


1141
01:46:26.952 --> 01:46:29.789
若我不做点什么 两天后她就会告诉我钚241的事
If I don't do something, in two days, she tells me about the 241.


1142
01:46:29.872 --> 01:46:31.040
那是无法改变的
Nothing can change that.


1143
01:46:31.373 --> 01:46:32.374
等着瞧
We'll see.


1144
01:46:33.167 --> 01:46:34.502
把她带来
Just get her here.


1145
01:46:37.129 --> 01:46:38.047
你好 普莉亚
Hello, Priya.


1146
01:46:39.090 --> 01:46:41.926
怎么回事？尼尔呢？
What's going on?


1147
01:46:46.055 --> 01:46:46.931
我做了什么？
What did I do?


1148
01:46:47.014 --> 01:46:50.101
是你打算做什么 两天后你会派我把钚241
It's what you're going to do. In two days, you're gonna have me dangle plutonium-241


1149
01:46:51.345 --> 01:46:53.814
拿到世上最危险的军火商面前当钓饵
in front of the world's most dangerous arms dealer.


1150
01:46:53.354 --> 01:46:54.897
我想要知道原因
Now, I wanna know why.


1151
01:46:55.147 --> 01:46:57.274
你让萨托拿到钚241？
You let Sator get hold of 241?


1152
01:46:57.441 --> 01:46:59.193
不 我让他拿到演算机
No, I let him get ahold of the algorithm.


1153
01:47:00.820 --> 01:47:02.655
告诉我实情 普莉亚
So, tell me about it, Priya.


1154
01:47:02.988 --> 01:47:05.658
那是独一无二的
It's... It's unique.


1155
01:47:05.741 --> 01:47:09.286
打造它的科学家自杀了 这样她就不会被迫打造另一台
The scientist who built it took her own life so she couldn't be forced to make another.


1156
01:47:09.370 --> 01:47:10.371
未来的科学家？
A scientist in the future?


1157
01:47:10.454 --> 01:47:11.664
好几个世代以后
Generations from now.


1158
01:47:11.747 --> 01:47:13.165
她为什么必须自杀？
Why does she have to kill herself?


1159
01:47:13.666 --> 01:47:15.584
你知道曼哈顿计划吗？
You're familiar with the Manhattan Project?


1160
01:47:16.544 --> 01:47:20.089
第一次原子弹试爆前 欧本海默开始担心
As they approached the first atomic test,


1161
01:47:26.303 --> 01:47:30.266
想像她是那个世代的欧本海默
Think of our scientist as her generation's Oppenheimer.


1162
01:47:30.850 --> 01:47:33.185
她发明了逆转世界的方法
She devises a method for inverting the world,


1163
01:47:33.352 --> 01:47:37.565
但是坚信只要毁灭我们 也会毁灭他们自己
but becomes convinced that by destroying us, they're destroying themselves.


1164
01:47:37.731 --> 01:47:39.483
祖父悖论
The grandfather paradox.


1165
01:47:39.650 --> 01:47:42.945
但是和欧本海默不同 她坚决反抗
But, unlike Oppenheimer,


1166
01:47:45.239 --> 01:47:47.658
然后藏在她能想到最好的地方
and hiding them the best place she can think of.


1167
01:47:48.200 --> 01:47:50.411
过去 也就是现今
The past.


1168
01:47:54.457 --> 01:47:57.877
九个受到史上最严密保护的物质
Nine bombs. Nine sets of the most closely guarded materials in the history of the world.


1169
01:47:57.960 --> 01:48:00.087
最安全的隐藏处
The best hiding place possible.


1170
01:48:00.171 --> 01:48:02.214
核子安全厂房
Nuclear containment facilities.


1171
01:48:03.007 --> 01:48:07.011
萨托受到未来人资助 终其一生的任务
Sator's lifelong mission, financed and guided by the future, has been to


1172
01:48:07.094 --> 01:48:09.472
就是找到并组装演算机
find and reassemble the algorithm.


1173
01:48:09.638 --> 01:48:10.973
他们为何挑中他？
Why do they choose him?


1174
01:48:11.056 --> 01:48:12.933
因为他刚好出现在对的地方
Because he was at the right place at the right time.


1175
01:48:13.058 --> 01:48:15.186
苏联解体的时候
The collapse of the Soviet Union.


1176
01:48:15.352 --> 01:48:18.439
核武史上最不安全的时刻
The most insecure moment in the history of nuclear weapons.


1177
01:48:18.606 --> 01:48:20.775
他有几个部分？
How many sections does he have?


1178
01:48:20.941 --> 01:48:22.526
拿到钚241后 九个都有
After the 241, all nine.


1179
01:48:22.693 --> 01:48:24.195
老天爷
Jesus Christ.


1180
01:48:24.779 --> 01:48:27.740
所以这次我们要采取不一样的行动
And that's why you're going to do things differently this time.


1181
01:48:28.699 --> 01:48:31.535
改变作法？好让凯萨琳不受伤？
To change things?


1182
01:48:35.915 --> 01:48:37.792
那个宇宙若是存在
If that universe can exist...


1183
01:48:38.250 --> 01:48:39.585
也没有我们容身之处
we don't live in it.


1184
01:48:39.668 --> 01:48:40.920
总得试试看吧
Well, let's try.


1185
01:48:41.629 --> 01:48:43.339
你会警告我
You're going to warn me.


1186
01:48:43.506 --> 01:48:47.051
我不会 无知是我们的优势
No, I'm not. Ignorance is our ammunition.


1187
01:48:47.134 --> 01:48:47.968
拜托
Come on.


1188
01:48:48.135 --> 01:48:50.346
你若知道演算机是什么
If you had known what the algorithm was,


1189
01:48:50.513 --> 01:48:52.640
还会让它落在萨托手上？
would you have let it fall into Sator's hands?


1190
01:48:54.058 --> 01:48:56.018
你希望萨托拿到最后一部分
You want Sator to get the last section.


1191
01:48:56.102 --> 01:48:58.604
这样他才会带来另外八个
That is the only way he'll bring together the other eight.


1192
01:48:58.771 --> 01:49:00.439
我应该偷走它
I was supposed to steal it...


1193
01:49:01.148 --> 01:49:01.982
然后弄丢它？
then lose it?


1194
01:49:02.149 --> 01:49:03.526
任务达成
Mission accomplished.


1195
01:49:04.068 --> 01:49:05.486
你利用我
You used me.


1196
01:49:06.529 --> 01:49:07.863
就像你利用凯萨琳
As you used Katherine.


1197
01:49:08.781 --> 01:49:10.449
标准行动程序
Standard operating procedure.


1198
01:49:12.034 --> 01:49:13.410
你尽了你的职责
You've done your part.


1199
01:49:13.994 --> 01:49:14.829
我的职责？
My part?


1200
01:49:15.329 --> 01:49:17.790
我是这项行动的主人翁
I'm the protagonist of this operation.


1201
01:49:17.957 --> 01:49:21.127
你只是其中一个
You... are a protagonist.


1202
01:49:21.210 --> 01:49:24.422
你自以为是拯救世界唯一的救世主？
Did you think you were the only one capable of saving the world?


1203
01:49:28.843 --> 01:49:29.885
不是
No.


1204
01:49:31.262 --> 01:49:33.973
但我是 因为我还没告诉你
But I am.


1205
01:49:36.225 --> 01:49:37.309
你马上就会告诉我
You're about to.


1206
01:49:37.393 --> 01:49:40.062
才不会 那就让我们参一脚
No, I'm not. So, deal us in.


1207
01:49:41.272 --> 01:49:42.314
我们？
"Us"?


1208
01:49:42.857 --> 01:49:44.400
为何又要把她拖下水？
Why would you want to involve her again?


1209
01:49:44.483 --> 01:49:45.776
因为她能接近他
Because she can get close to him.


1210
01:49:45.860 --> 01:49:47.153
他还信任她吗？
Does he still trust her?


1211
01:49:47.319 --> 01:49:49.655
他以为她死了 但他曾经信任她
He thinks she's dead.


1212
01:49:52.366 --> 01:49:53.701
现在轮到你了
And now, it's your turn.


1213
01:49:53.951 --> 01:49:57.079
就算你觉得她知道太多 还是得假设她逃过死劫
Assuming she makes it out alive,whether or not you feel she knows too much.


1214
01:49:57.371 --> 01:49:58.581
办不到

1215
01:50:00.968 --> 01:50:03.337
那就和负责处理的人谈谈
then talk to whoever's in charge of loose ends.


1216
01:50:02.668 --> 01:50:04.503
我要你承诺
I need your word


1217
01:50:04.587 --> 01:50:07.173
她和她儿子的安全 普莉亚
that she and her son will be safe, Priya.


1218
01:50:07.256 --> 01:50:09.508
干我们这行承诺有什么用？
What good is someone's word in our line of business?


1219
01:50:15.598 --> 01:50:16.766
他们会很安全
They'll be safe.


1220
01:50:18.559 --> 01:50:20.644
特隆赫姆外海有个集合点
There's a rally point offshore at Trondheim.


1221
01:50:20.811 --> 01:50:22.271
设法赶到那里
Get yourselves up there.


1222
01:50:22.354 --> 01:50:24.315
艾佛斯有一个小组准备逆转
Ives has a team ready to invert.


1223
01:50:24.398 --> 01:50:25.691
你有逆转门？
You have a turnstile?


1224
01:50:25.858 --> 01:50:28.569
和我们试图摧毁的科技一模一样
The exact technology that we're trying to suppress.


1225
01:50:28.652 --> 01:50:30.905
以火攻火很危险
Fighting fire with fire's a treacherous business.


1226
01:50:31.280 --> 01:50:33.574
但是未来有一些人
But there are some people, in the future,


1227
01:50:33.741 --> 01:50:36.911
想要继续把演算机送回过去
who want to continue the algorithm's journey into the past.


1228
01:50:37.912 --> 01:50:42.458
你要知道 天能不是在过去建立
You see... Tenet wasn't founded in the past.


1229
01:50:42.625 --> 01:50:45.294
而是将在未来成立
It will be founded in the future.


1230
01:51:12.029 --> 01:51:13.948
还是不习惯鸟倒着飞
Can't get over the birds.


1231
01:51:14.031 --> 01:51:15.783
还好吧？
How're you feeling?


1232
01:51:21.122 --> 01:51:22.665
告诉我你会杀了他
Tell me you're gonna kill him.


1233
01:51:23.165 --> 01:51:24.250
办不到
I can't.


1234
01:51:24.333 --> 01:51:25.501
为什么？
Why not?


1235
01:51:25.668 --> 01:51:27.503
我打赌你一定杀过很多人
Bet you've probably killed a lot of people.


1236
01:51:27.670 --> 01:51:29.713
他有个失能开关
Not with a dead man's switch.


1237
01:51:29.880 --> 01:51:31.632
就是他戴的智慧手环
The fitness tracker he wears.


1238
01:51:31.757 --> 01:51:33.300
他一直在监控他的健康
He's obsessive about his health.


1239
01:51:33.384 --> 01:51:34.885
手环连结到一个开关
It'll be linked to a switch,


1240
01:51:34.969 --> 01:51:38.722
大概是一封电邮透露情报点的位置
probably a simple e-mail burst that reveals the location of the dead drop,


1241
01:51:38.806 --> 01:51:40.683
他心跳一停止就会起动
set to fire if his heart stops.


1242
01:51:40.766 --> 01:51:42.935
他的死会启动演算机
His death activates the algorithm.


1243
01:51:43.018 --> 01:51:46.522
他死了世界就会毁灭 没人敢杀他
He dies, the world ends. No one dares kill him.


1244
01:51:48.899 --> 01:51:50.818
不对 你想错了
No, you've missed the point.


1245
01:51:53.154 --> 01:51:54.864
他打算自我了结
He's intending to end his life.


1246
01:51:56.991 --> 01:51:57.825
为什么？
Why?


1247
01:51:59.618 --> 01:52:01.036
他就快死了
He's dying.


1248
01:52:02.079 --> 01:52:04.123
无法治愈的胰脏癌
Inoperable pancreatic cancer.


1249
01:52:05.750 --> 01:52:07.668
他要把全世界当成陪葬品
And he's taking the world with him.


1250
01:52:07.918 --> 01:52:09.879
他若无法拥有 谁都不能
If he can't have her, no one can.


1251
01:52:10.212 --> 01:52:13.883
他能决定何时何处毁灭世界
He gets to choose the time and place for the end of the world.


1252
01:52:14.300 --> 01:52:16.761
他会选择哪个时刻？
What moment? What does he choose?


1253
01:52:18.763 --> 01:52:21.724
你曾说某次度假让他觉得被爱
You told me about a holiday where you let him feel loved.


1254
01:52:21.807 --> 01:52:23.017
越南
Vietnam.


1255
01:52:23.100 --> 01:52:25.019
你说他消失不见 是哪一天？
You said he vanished. What day?


1256
01:52:25.102 --> 01:52:27.897
我和麦斯上岸 他搭机飞走 但不知道是哪一天
I went ashore with Max and he flew off, but I don't know what day it was.


1257
01:52:27.980 --> 01:52:31.317
14号 10天前 他人在乌克兰
It was the 14th. Ten days ago.


1258
01:52:33.527 --> 01:52:35.654
你怎么知道的？
How do you know about that?


1259
01:52:37.031 --> 01:52:39.241
重点是他不在游艇上 那是他的空档
The point is, he wasn't on his yacht, so that's his window.


1260
01:52:39.325 --> 01:52:41.786
回到那个黄金时刻 也是他生命的最后一刻
To go back to that golden moment and have it be his last.


1261
01:52:41.869 --> 01:52:43.412
每个人的最后一刻
Everyone's last.


1262
01:52:43.496 --> 01:52:46.540
我们得神不知鬼不觉 从情报点偷走演算机
We have to lift the algorithm from the dead drop


1263
01:52:48.918 --> 01:52:50.461
而且大家不必陪葬
And not the rest of us.


1264
01:52:50.544 --> 01:52:51.670
情报点在哪里？
Where's the dead drop?


1265
01:52:51.754 --> 01:52:53.422
天机不可泄漏 朋友
Knowledge divided, my friend.


1266
01:52:53.506 --> 01:52:54.423
你不告诉我？
You're not gonna tell me?


1267
01:52:54.507 --> 01:52:56.258
无知是我们的优势
Ignorance is our ammunition.


1268
01:52:56.342 --> 01:52:57.968
但我需要你回到游艇 凯特
But I need you back on that yacht, Kat.


1269
01:52:58.135 --> 01:52:59.178
为什么？
Why?


1270
01:52:59.345 --> 01:53:01.138
你得阻止他自杀

1271
01:53:01.222 --> 01:53:04.350
直到我们确定演算机不在情报点
You have to stop him killing himself until we know the algorithm is out of the dead drop.


1272
01:53:04.433 --> 01:53:06.602
要是我被逮到 我儿子会目睹一切
But if I'm caught there, my son sees.


1273
01:53:06.685 --> 01:53:10.439
若他时候到了 我不希望他死前看到这一幕
I don't want those moments to be full of anguish if they're gonna be his last.


1274
01:53:11.273 --> 01:53:13.275
不会的
They're not.


1275
01:53:37.508 --> 01:53:38.467
时间到了
It's time.


1276
01:53:38.551 --> 01:53:42.012
我们正在倒退回14号 但不知道情报点在哪里
We're working our way back to the 14th, but without knowing where the dead drop is,


1277
01:53:42.096 --> 01:53:44.473
我也没办法准备什么
there's only so much I can do to prepare.


1278
01:53:45.641 --> 01:53:47.476
你知道震源是什么吗？
You know what a hypocenter is?


1279
01:53:48.853 --> 01:53:51.272
地下核武试爆的原爆点
It's ground zero for an underground nuclear test.


1280
01:53:51.355 --> 01:53:56.402
麦可寇斯比爵士告诉我 史托斯克12市14号有一场核爆
Sir Michael Crosby told me about a detonation in Stalsk-12 on the 14th.


1281
01:53:56.569 --> 01:53:58.654
情报点就在震源底下
The dead drop is at the bottom of the hypocenter.


1282
01:53:58.821 --> 01:54:01.782
核爆把演算机封在地底
That explosion seals up the algorithm.


1283
01:54:01.949 --> 01:54:05.578
我们最好在核爆前把它挖出来
Well, then we better pull it out of that hole before the bomb goes off, eh?


1284
01:54:07.997 --> 01:54:09.373
排队
Line it up.


1285
01:54:09.790 --> 01:54:10.791
向前走
Move forward.


1286
01:54:12.918 --> 01:54:13.919
下一个
Next.


1287
01:54:18.507 --> 01:54:19.508
排队
Line it up.


1288
01:54:21.010 --> 01:54:22.219
尼尔呢？
Where's Neil?


1289
01:54:25.347 --> 01:54:26.682
他一定先过去了
He must've gone through already.


1290
01:54:26.766 --> 01:54:27.850
我没有说再见
I didn't get to say goodbye.


1291
01:54:28.559 --> 01:54:30.019
这就是再见 不是吗？
This is goodbye, isn't it?


1292
01:54:30.186 --> 01:54:33.189
我很想说 你不必这么做
I'd like to say...that you don't have to do this


1293
01:54:33.272 --> 01:54:36.984
安德烈对我做过最坏的事 就是他向我提出条件
Kat...Worst thing Andrei ever did to me was that offer he made me.


1294
01:54:37.151 --> 01:54:40.154
我不再见儿子 他就放我走
Let me go if I agreed never to see my son again.


1295
01:54:41.447 --> 01:54:44.617
我大吼大叫 大飙脏话
I shouted and... swore.


1296
01:54:45.743 --> 01:54:48.162
但有一瞬间他从我表情看出
But he'd seen it on my face, just for an instant.


1297
01:54:51.415 --> 01:54:53.084
我在认真考虑
I considered it.


1298
01:54:53.751 --> 01:54:56.087
我不知道是因为我恨透他了
I don't know if I hate him more for what he's done,


1299
01:54:56.170 --> 01:54:58.255
或是因为他看穿了我
or because he knows that about me.


1300
01:54:58.464 --> 01:54:59.465
喔
Oh.


1301
01:55:01.425 --> 01:55:05.012
有机会救我儿子 你不了解那对一个母亲的意义
A chance to help save my child. You can't know what that means to a mother.


1302
01:55:05.179 --> 01:55:06.013
没错
No.


1303
01:55:07.140 --> 01:55:09.009
你曾经杀过你痛恨的人
You've killed people you've hated before.


1304
01:55:08.557 --> 01:55:09.850
通常不是出于私仇
It's not usually personal.


1305
01:55:09.934 --> 01:55:11.936
反正他快死了 也许并不算
Well, he's dying anyway. Maybe it doesn't even count.


1306
01:55:12.019 --> 01:55:13.646
每杀一个人都算
It always counts, Kat.


1307
01:55:14.105 --> 01:55:16.857
你不是去杀他 而是去阻止他
You're not there to kill him, you're the backstop.


1308
01:55:17.775 --> 01:55:20.277
若我们没偷走演算机 他自杀成功
If we don't lift that algorithm and he kills himself,


1309
01:55:20.444 --> 01:55:22.071
就会害死全人类
he takes us all with him.


1310
01:55:24.740 --> 01:55:26.826
遵守你的承诺 好吗？
You just keep up your end, okay?


1311
01:55:30.996 --> 01:55:31.997
今天是14号
Today's the 14th.


1312
01:55:32.498 --> 01:55:35.418
西伯利亚外海 该行动了
Offshore of Siberia.


1313
01:55:38.838 --> 01:55:41.382
-谁能让我登上游艇？ -我有最佳的人选
give you some time to get back into Vietnam. And who gets me on the yacht?


1314
01:55:45.052 --> 01:55:47.430
你一定会在某时某处受到威胁
There may be a time and place you feel threatened.


1315
01:55:47.555 --> 01:55:50.224
按下通话键 说出你的位置就挂断
Hit "talk," state your location, hang up.


1316
01:55:50.683 --> 01:55:52.268
谁会听到留言？
Who gets the message?


1317
01:55:52.726 --> 01:55:54.353
后代的人
Posterity.


1318
01:56:33.768 --> 01:56:35.102
史托斯克12市
Stalsk-12.


1319
01:56:35.269 --> 01:56:38.647
一座隐匿的城市 什么事都有可能发生
Hidden from the world is a city where anything can happen.


1320
01:56:38.731 --> 01:56:41.317
就在今天  各位 10分钟后
And today, ladies and gents, for ten minutes, it most assuredly does.


1321
01:56:41.400 --> 01:56:43.152
一定会发生一件惊天大事

1322
01:56:43.235 --> 01:56:46.822
你们被分成两队 展开时间钳形攻势
You've been divided into two teams for a temporal pincer movement.


1323
01:56:46.906 --> 01:56:48.365
我们是红队 顺着时间向前
We're Red Team, moving forward.


1324
01:56:48.449 --> 01:56:50.910
为了容易分辨 你们会配戴这些
In order to distinguish the teams, you'll wear these.


1325
01:56:50.993 --> 01:56:54.789
那边的朋友 由惠勒中校率领的蓝队逆转时间
Our friends over there, Blue Team, led by Commander Wheeler, are inverted.


1326
01:56:54.872 --> 01:56:56.707
为什么不让我们看到他们？
Why don't they let us see them?


1327
01:56:56.791 --> 01:56:58.542
也许我们不会喜欢发生的事
Maybe we won't like what happened.


1328
01:56:58.626 --> 01:57:01.504
他们1小时后会听到同样的简报
One hour from now, they had this briefing.


1329
01:57:03.422 --> 01:57:06.675
然后会空降在震源上方的山脊
Then, were dropped on the ridge above the hypocenter,


1330
01:57:06.842 --> 01:57:09.095
尽量接近核爆发生的时间
as close in time to the detonation as possible.


1331
01:57:09.261 --> 01:57:13.099
他们的任务是清除现场
Their objectives were clearance and clarification.


1332
01:57:13.265 --> 01:57:17.019
这次简报有他们在未来的经验
Now, this briefing has the benefit of their experience.


1333
01:57:33.911 --> 01:57:35.746
两支队伍都有倒数码表
Both teams have countdown watches.


1334
01:57:35.913 --> 01:57:40.000
我们空降后从10倒数 一直到0的核爆发生
Ours counts down from ten, from landing to zero to the explosion.


1335
01:57:40.084 --> 01:57:41.877
-蓝队的时间被逆转 -大伙儿 向左看
- Blue Team is reversed. - Everybody, look to your left.


1336
01:57:42.044 --> 01:57:46.048
要是你到0还没到空降区 就别想活着离开
If you are not at the LZ at zero, you are not leaving.


1337
01:57:47.133 --> 01:57:48.426
了解吗？
Do you understand?


1338
01:57:48.717 --> 01:57:52.221
空降后清除现场让蓝队安全撤退
We drop in, clear LZs for Blue Team evacuation.


1339
01:57:52.388 --> 01:57:54.014
然后一路挺进市区
We make our way into the city proper.


1340
01:57:54.181 --> 01:57:58.269
这些是废弃建筑物 但我们得知 某处有一道逆转门
These buildings are abandoned, but we learned there is a turnstile.


1341
01:57:58.352 --> 01:58:00.354
可能会遭到敌人攻击
Expect a bitemporal response.


1342
01:58:00.438 --> 01:58:02.022
会有逆转时间的弹炮吗？
They'll have inverse ordnance?


1343
01:58:02.106 --> 01:58:04.358
逆转时间的、传统的
Inverse, conventional,


1344
01:58:04.442 --> 01:58:07.486
正常的敌人、逆转的敌人 什么都有
forward antagonists, inverted antagonists, they have it all.


1345
01:58:07.611 --> 01:58:11.740
城市另一边的地面隆起 一直到震源上方的山脊
On the other side of the city, the ground rises to the ridge above the hypocenter.


1346
01:58:11.824 --> 01:58:17.037
小分队会从市区走这条隧道 一直到震源的地底
A splinter unit will take this tunnel from the city to the floor of the hypocenter.


1347
01:58:17.121 --> 01:58:19.748
蓝队守住这里的入口
Blue Team located an entrance here.


1348
01:58:19.915 --> 01:58:21.959
这块岩石里的炸弹
The bomb is in this rock,


1349
01:58:22.126 --> 01:58:26.172
会在高处引爆造成山崩 封住山洞
high above, to trigger a collapse,


1350
01:58:27.882 --> 01:58:30.468
不用 炸弹会按照计划引爆
We don't. The explosion takes place as planned.


1351
01:58:30.634 --> 01:58:34.472
我们的任务就是拆除炸弹失败
Now, our job is to fail to defuse that bomb


1352
01:58:34.555 --> 01:58:38.100
好让小分队神不知鬼不觉完成任务
while the splinter unit achieves its task undetected.


1353
01:58:38.184 --> 01:58:39.101
什么任务？
Which is?


1354
01:58:39.185 --> 01:58:40.478
这是机密 你不必知道
Need-to-know, and you don't.


1355
01:58:41.353 --> 01:58:43.022
还有别的蠢问题吗？
Any other stupid questions?


1356
01:58:43.397 --> 01:58:45.691
很好 走吧 快去准备
Good. Well, let's go. Let's get ready.


1357
01:58:48.611 --> 01:58:50.029
我要参与第一波行动
I wanted to be on the first wave.


1358
01:58:50.196 --> 01:58:54.158
没有第一波行动 红队和蓝队同时展开行动
There is no first wave. Red Team and Blue Team operate simultaneously.


1359
01:58:54.241 --> 01:58:58.078
听好 你若拘泥于传统线性时间 就别上直升机
Look, don't get on the chopper if you can't stop thinking in linear terms.


1360
01:58:58.162 --> 01:59:01.749
你想加入成功得手的队伍吗？
Now, you wanna be on the team that lifts the contents of the capsule?


1361
01:59:01.832 --> 01:59:03.334
当然想
Absolutely.


1362
01:59:03.959 --> 01:59:05.377
那就是我们俩
Yeah, that's us.


1363
01:59:06.003 --> 01:59:07.463
我们是小分队
We're splinter unit.


1364
01:59:07.546 --> 01:59:08.631
只有我们？
Just us?


1365
01:59:09.340 --> 01:59:12.510
知道容器里装什么的人 不能离开战场
No one who knows the contents of that capsule can leave the field.


1366
01:59:13.219 --> 01:59:15.679
我们会自己搞定
I thought we'd manage ourselves.


1367
01:59:25.606 --> 01:59:28.526
甲板离水面有40尺 你下得去吗？
It's 40 feet from the private deck to the water.


1368
01:59:30.820 --> 01:59:33.197
我发射信号弹前别让他死
Until you see my signal, you don't let him die.


1369
02:00:09.150 --> 02:00:10.526
30秒
Thirty seconds!


1370
02:00:51.609 --> 02:00:52.777
快上 快上
Go! Go! Go!


1371
02:01:04.330 --> 02:01:07.583
我们即将遭遇冲击波 抓紧了
We're coming in on a shockwave. Hang on, people.


1372
02:01:16.717 --> 02:01:18.010
站起来
On your feet!


1373
02:01:31.774 --> 02:01:33.150
那里
There!


1374
02:01:46.163 --> 02:01:48.040
夫人 我们以为您上岸了
Ma'am. We thought you'd gone ashore.


1375
02:01:48.124 --> 02:01:49.792
我偷溜回来给安德烈一个惊喜
Well, I snuck back to surprise Andrei.


1376
02:01:49.875 --> 02:01:50.709
老板走了耶
Oh, the boss left.


1377
02:01:52.169 --> 02:01:55.756
请萨托先生来这里找我 别告诉其他人
Well, have Mr. Sator find me here.


1378
02:03:04.784 --> 02:03:05.785
地雷
Mines!


1379
02:03:05.993 --> 02:03:06.952
地雷
Mines!


1380
02:03:21.300 --> 02:03:22.927
他们说你上岸了
They told me you'd gone ashore.


1381
02:03:24.970 --> 02:03:26.263
他们说你飞走了
They told me you'd flown off.


1382
02:03:26.347 --> 02:03:28.474
我回来看你和麦斯
I came back to see you and Max.


1383
02:03:28.557 --> 02:03:30.601
麦斯跟安娜在岸上
Max is on shore with Anna.


1384
02:03:31.769 --> 02:03:33.479
我们吵过架 得好好谈谈
We need time, just you and me, after what happened.


1385
02:03:33.562 --> 02:03:36.107
我只是开玩笑 那是个蠢笑话
I was joking. It was a stupid joke.


1386
02:03:36.732 --> 02:03:38.192
你认为我是个坏妈妈
You think I'm a terrible mother.


1387
02:03:38.275 --> 02:03:41.779
我们都知道你比较讨厌我
We both know my opinion of you is higher than yours of me.


1388
02:03:49.662 --> 02:03:51.997
我希望我们的关系好一点
I want things to be better, Andrei.


1389
02:04:07.680 --> 02:04:08.848
找掩护
Take cover!


1390
02:04:13.227 --> 02:04:15.104
给我AT4反坦克火箭筒
Get me a goddamn AT4!


1391
02:04:15.187 --> 02:04:16.439
马上把他除掉
Take him out, now!


1392
02:04:17.022 --> 02:04:18.441
提供掩护
Provide some cover!


1393
02:04:18.607 --> 02:04:20.443
快点 快啊 快上
Move, move, move! Let's go!


1394
02:04:20.609 --> 02:04:21.902
快 快
Move, move, move!


1395
02:05:32.223 --> 02:05:33.057
惠勒
Wheeler!


1396
02:05:34.809 --> 02:05:35.810
快逃
Get outta there!


1397
02:05:35.976 --> 02:05:37.144
来啊
Come on!


1398
02:05:42.817 --> 02:05:43.651
艾佛斯
Ives!


1399
02:05:45.903 --> 02:05:47.530
小分队 这里
Splinter unit. Here.


1400
02:05:49.281 --> 02:05:51.575
今天的夕阳会很美
You know, it's going to be a beautiful sunset.


1401
02:05:51.659 --> 02:05:55.538
我会派人带麦斯回来 我们应该跟他有亲子时间
I'll get Max brought back. We should share the moment with him.


1402
02:05:56.163 --> 02:05:58.165
我替你倒杯酒
I'll make you a drink.


1403
02:05:59.125 --> 02:06:01.127
把我儿子带回游艇
Bring my son back to the boat.


1404
02:06:07.633 --> 02:06:08.801
没时间了 快走
We're runnin' out of time, let's go!


1405
02:06:08.884 --> 02:06:11.679
他们看到我们就完了
If they see us, it's all for nothing.


1406
02:06:14.890 --> 02:06:16.308
需要声东击西
We need a distraction.


1407
02:06:16.392 --> 02:06:17.726
安啦
Don't worry about that.


1408
02:06:21.397 --> 02:06:22.815
听我命令
On my mark!


1409
02:06:25.651 --> 02:06:27.278
用火箭筒炮轰基地
RPG, hit the base!


1410
02:06:28.320 --> 02:06:29.655
炮轰那栋建筑物
That building on my mark!


1411
02:06:31.449 --> 02:06:33.242
3、2
Three! Two!


1412
02:06:33.409 --> 02:06:35.161
1 开火
One! Fire!


1413
02:06:36.287 --> 02:06:37.204
开火
Fire!


1414
02:06:52.511 --> 02:06:53.804
快上
Move! Move!


1415
02:07:09.528 --> 02:07:11.530
没退路了 来吧
We're committed now. Come on.


1416
02:07:17.828 --> 02:07:19.413
那是什么？
What's that?


1417
02:07:19.580 --> 02:07:22.041
我向中情局借来的
I borrowed it from the CIA.


1418
02:07:23.334 --> 02:07:24.376
是什么？
What is it?


1419
02:07:24.543 --> 02:07:26.796
毁灭世界的方法
The way the world ends.


1420
02:07:26.962 --> 02:07:29.632
不是轰隆巨响 而是悄然一声
Not with a bang, but a whimper.


1421
02:07:29.840 --> 02:07:31.550
我不懂
I don't understand.


1422
02:07:31.717 --> 02:07:33.844
我吞下这个 万物都会消逝
When I take this, it's all over.


1423
02:07:34.595 --> 02:07:36.430
那就先别吞
Then don't take it yet.


1424
02:07:39.475 --> 02:07:41.102
为什么？
Why not?


1425
02:07:42.728 --> 02:07:44.772
因为就快看到夕阳了
Because we have the sunset coming.


1426
02:07:45.106 --> 02:07:47.566
还剩下一点伏特加
And a little vodka left.


1427
02:07:47.733 --> 02:07:49.693
麦斯也很快就回来
And Max will be here soon.


1428
02:07:49.860 --> 02:07:53.864
他们说是你在岸上陪麦斯 不是安娜
They said they thought it was you, not Anna, ashore with Max.


1429
02:07:56.659 --> 02:08:00.079
只要你分得出来就好
So long as you can tell the difference.


1430
02:08:02.248 --> 02:08:04.917
我要办正事了 亲爱的
A moment's business, my love.


1431
02:08:17.096 --> 02:08:18.389
米耶 收到吗？
Mahir, do you copy?


1432
02:08:18.556 --> 02:08:21.600
还不行 我重覆 还不行
Not clear. I repeat, not clear!


1433
02:08:21.767 --> 02:08:22.768
收到
Copy that.


1434
02:08:23.018 --> 02:08:26.147
我重覆 还不行
I repeat, not clear!


1435
02:08:52.715 --> 02:08:53.799
尼尔
Neil!


1436
02:08:54.592 --> 02:08:55.676
尼尔
Neil!


1437
02:09:08.522 --> 02:09:09.648
快上
Go!


1438
02:09:18.574 --> 02:09:21.243
炸弹威力不够把门炸开
We don't have anything big enough to blow this.


1439
02:09:27.583 --> 02:09:29.335
搜他身 看有没有手榴弹
Try him. See if he's got a grenade.


1440
02:09:34.006 --> 02:09:35.007
有吗？
Anything?


1441
02:09:35.174 --> 02:09:36.133
没有
Nah, nothing.


1442
02:09:37.244 --> 02:09:39.614
过来看看 能不能撬开锁？
Here, you try having a look. Can you pick it?


1443
02:09:39.095 --> 02:09:42.223
希望不能 那锁花了我很多钱
I hope not. I paid a lot for that lock.


1444
02:09:42.306 --> 02:09:45.267
喜欢我旅程的开始 还有你旅程的结束吗？
How do you like where my journey began and yours ends?


1445
02:09:45.351 --> 02:09:46.852
核弹的辐射太强了
Little radioactive for my taste.


1446
02:09:47.019 --> 02:09:49.939
我的宿命和核弹息息相关
My fate was always bound up with radiation.


1447
02:09:51.148 --> 02:09:53.526
我们在最危险的地方干活
We'd work where no one else would.


1448
02:09:53.943 --> 02:09:56.403
我和魔鬼做了交易
I made a bargain with the devil.


1449
02:09:56.487 --> 02:09:58.072
金钱交换时间
Money for time.


1450
02:09:58.239 --> 02:10:00.324
我们出卖我们的未来
We sold our futures.


1451
02:10:00.407 --> 02:10:03.577
现在你要犯下足以毁灭世界的错误
And now you're about to make the same mistake for the entire world.


1452
02:10:03.744 --> 02:10:06.664
那不是错误 而是我交换的条件
It wasn't a mistake. I made the bargain I could.


1453
02:10:06.831 --> 02:10:08.040
你的回报是什么？
What was yours?


1454
02:10:08.124 --> 02:10:10.835
你为了不解的使命而奋战
You fight for a cause you barely understand...


1455
02:10:11.460 --> 02:10:14.964
与你不信任的人合作 什么都没告诉他们
with people you trust so little, you've told them nothing.


1456
02:10:15.131 --> 02:10:17.216
我死了 世界也跟着我毁灭
When I die, the world dies with me.


1457
02:10:17.299 --> 02:10:19.385
你的知识也随着你消逝
And your knowledge dies with you,


1458
02:10:19.468 --> 02:10:23.139
一起被埋进坟里 就像一个无名的古埃及建筑工人
buried in a tomb like an anonymous Egyptian builder


1459
02:10:23.222 --> 02:10:25.766
被封在金字塔里以守住秘密
sealed in a pyramid to keep his secret.


1460
02:10:25.850 --> 02:10:28.436
你的信仰是盲目的 你是个疯子
Your faith is blind. You're a fanatic.


1461
02:10:49.039 --> 02:10:51.459
有什么比毁灭世界更疯狂？
What's more fanatical than trying to destroy the world?


1462
02:10:51.542 --> 02:10:54.086
并不是 我在创造一个新世界
I'm not, I'm creating a new one.


1463
02:10:54.628 --> 02:10:58.466
某时某处 一个人在水晶塔中打开开关
Somewhere, sometime, a man in a crystalline tower throws a switch


1464
02:10:59.049 --> 02:11:02.636
就同时触发并避免了世界末日
and Armageddon is both triggered and avoided.


1465
02:11:02.803 --> 02:11:06.182
现在时间自己逆转方向
Now time itself switches direction.


1466
02:11:06.265 --> 02:11:08.684
我们沐浴在其中的阳光
The same sunshine we basked in


1467
02:11:08.768 --> 02:11:12.646
将温暖我们在未来世代的后裔
will warm the faces of our descendants generations to come.


1468
02:11:12.813 --> 02:11:14.732
他们为何要杀死我们？
How could they wanna kill us?


1469
02:11:14.815 --> 02:11:18.152
因为他们的海水上涨、河流干枯
Because their oceans rose and their rivers ran dry.


1470
02:11:18.235 --> 02:11:21.822
你不明白吗？ 他们别无选择才会逆转时间
Don't you see? They have no choice but to turn back.


1471
02:11:22.448 --> 02:11:24.408
都是我们的错
We're responsible.


1472
02:11:37.963 --> 02:11:40.674
你知道了事实 还会阻止我吗？
Knowing this, do you still want me to stop?


1473
02:11:41.801 --> 02:11:45.596
会 每个世代都努力设法存活
Yes. Each generation looks out for its own survival.


1474
02:11:45.679 --> 02:11:47.598
这就是他们在做的
That's exactly what they're doing.


1475
02:11:47.681 --> 02:11:49.809
但你不是 你是个叛徒
But not you. You're a traitor.


1476
02:11:49.892 --> 02:11:52.978
你没有自己的人生才想害死所有人
Bringing death to all, because you have no life


1477
02:11:55.022 --> 02:11:56.607
你儿子的生命不会
Not your son's.


1478
02:11:56.690 --> 02:12:00.402
我最大的罪过就是把儿子 带进我明知会灭亡的世界
My greatest sin was to bring a son into a world I knew was ending.


1479
02:12:00.486 --> 02:12:02.404
你觉得上帝会宽恕我吗？
You think God will forgive me?


1480
02:12:08.202 --> 02:12:09.328
等等
Wait!


1481
02:12:10.371 --> 02:12:11.372
等等
Wait!


1482
02:12:12.414 --> 02:12:13.791
可恶
God...


1483
02:12:25.094 --> 02:12:26.637
掩护我
Cover me!


1484
02:12:34.520 --> 02:12:36.355
快上 快上
Go! Go! Go!


1485
02:12:38.149 --> 02:12:42.903
你不相信上帝或未来 或是在你经验之外的事
You don't believe in God, or a future, or anything outside of your own experience.


1486
02:12:43.070 --> 02:12:45.614
其它的才是信仰
The rest is belief.


1487
02:12:46.031 --> 02:12:47.992
而我没有信念
And I don't have it.


1488
02:12:48.617 --> 02:12:52.163
没有信念就不是人类 你只是个疯子
Without it, you're not human. You're just a madman.


1489
02:12:52.830 --> 02:12:55.791
或是一个神之类的
Or a god.


1490
02:13:00.254 --> 02:13:01.756
住手 天啊
Don't. Jesus.


1491
02:13:02.298 --> 02:13:03.758
我们的时间到了
Our time is up.


1492
02:13:10.347 --> 02:13:12.433
我会替你问候我老婆
I'll give your love to my wife.


1493
02:13:12.933 --> 02:13:15.102
你忘了 我还不认识她
You're forgetting. I haven't met her yet.


1494
02:13:15.352 --> 02:13:18.105
没错 你认识她以后她就死了
That's right. After you meet her, she dies.


1495
02:13:18.272 --> 02:13:20.733
那我就把我的爱给她
I'll just give her my love instead.


1496
02:13:22.026 --> 02:13:23.068
别这么做
Don't do...


1497
02:13:24.487 --> 02:13:25.321
瓦克夫
Volkov...


1498
02:13:25.988 --> 02:13:27.615
射爆他的头

1499
02:13:39.460 --> 02:13:41.462
别谈公事了 亲爱的
Enough business, my love.


1500
02:14:08.447 --> 02:14:11.450
你根本不知道我在说什么 对吧？
You have no idea what I'm talking about, do you?


1501
02:14:13.285 --> 02:14:15.913
不过听起来很重要
But it sounds terribly important.


1502
02:14:17.998 --> 02:14:19.250
你要去哪？
Where are you going?


1503
02:14:19.417 --> 02:14:20.668
你不热吗？
Aren't you hot?


1504
02:14:37.268 --> 02:14:38.519
你在干嘛？
What are you doing now?


1505
02:14:38.686 --> 02:14:40.354
防晒油挤得满地
I spilled sunscreen.


1506
02:14:40.813 --> 02:14:42.648
-又怎样？ -甲板很滑
- So what? - Slippery!


1507
02:14:45.985 --> 02:14:47.403
过来吧
Just come here.


1508
02:14:50.656 --> 02:14:53.409
转过去 你会喜欢的
Turn over. You'll like it.


1509
02:15:27.943 --> 02:15:29.320
我做不到
I can't do this.


1510
02:15:30.237 --> 02:15:32.990
-我不能让你以为你赢了 -别破坏这一刻 凯特
- I can't let you think you've won. - Don't spoil this moment, Kat.


1511
02:15:33.073 --> 02:15:35.910
我不会让你进了坟墓 还以为会带我们一起陪葬
I'm not letting you go to your grave thinking we're coming with you.


1512
02:15:38.329 --> 02:15:39.789
你会孤独死去 安德烈
You're dying alone, Andrei.


1513
02:15:39.955 --> 02:15:40.998
快点 快点
Come on, come on, come on!


1514
02:15:41.165 --> 02:15:43.501
隧道封死 闸门关闭
Tunnel's sealed, gate's closed.


1515
02:15:44.001 --> 02:15:45.503
米耶 收到吗？
Mahir, do you copy?


1516
02:15:45.961 --> 02:15:46.796
收到
Yeah.


1517
02:15:46.962 --> 02:15:48.798
先别行动 我重覆 别行动
Hold. I repeat, hold!


1518
02:15:54.136 --> 02:15:55.387
看着我的双眼
Look in my eyes.


1519
02:15:56.722 --> 02:15:58.182
你看到什么？
Which do you see?


1520
02:15:59.266 --> 02:16:02.186
绝望或愤怒？
Despair or anger?


1521
02:16:03.771 --> 02:16:07.775
我不是能给你爱的女人 虽然你伤了她的心
I'm not the woman who could find love for you even though you scarred her on the inside.


1522
02:16:09.568 --> 02:16:13.405
我是被你射伤 存心要报复的悍妇
I'm the vengeful bitch you scarred on the outside.


1523
02:16:16.617 --> 02:16:17.618
不
No!


1524
02:16:36.846 --> 02:16:37.680
惨了
Shit.


1525
02:16:39.533 --> 02:16:41.669
艾佛斯 她杀了他 收到吗？ 她杀死了他
Ives, she's killed him. Ives, do you copy? She's killed him.


1526
02:16:41.267 --> 02:16:44.019
她太早行动 杀死了他
She jumped the gun. She killed him.


1527
02:17:02.496 --> 02:17:04.999
快啊 他们到那里了吗？
Come on, come on! Do you think they made it?


1528
02:17:09.336 --> 02:17:10.588
管它的
Ah, screw it.


1529
02:18:21.408 --> 02:18:23.953
凯特 你太早行动了
Kat! You jumped the gun!


1530
02:18:24.120 --> 02:18:28.082
我办不到 我不能让他觉得自己赢了才死
I couldn't do it. I couldn't let him die thinking he'd won.


1531
02:18:28.165 --> 02:18:30.251
我知道你会有办法
I knew you'd find a way.


1532
02:18:30.835 --> 02:18:32.920
等等 你有办法 我们不会死吧？
Wait, you found a way, we're okay, right?


1533
02:18:33.003 --> 02:18:35.131
对 我有办法 保重
Yeah, found a way. Be safe.


1534
02:18:56.819 --> 02:18:58.237
我还以为你是逆转的
Thought you were inverted.


1535
02:18:58.446 --> 02:19:00.156
我在中间换了时间
Changed gears halfway.


1536
02:19:01.657 --> 02:19:03.451
看来你们这里需要帮忙
Looked like you needed help here.


1537
02:19:03.534 --> 02:19:05.870
这里？在下面时才需要帮忙
Here? We needed help down there.


1538
02:19:07.037 --> 02:19:08.414
你怎么把锁打开？
How'd you get that lock open?


1539
02:19:09.248 --> 02:19:11.500
不是我 你的小队不是需要你？
Wasn't me. Didn't your team need you?


1540
02:19:12.251 --> 02:19:14.253
下一次回去时再去带他们
I'll get 'em on the next pass.


1541
02:19:14.920 --> 02:19:15.921
好吗 艾佛斯？
All right, Ives?


1542
02:19:16.464 --> 02:19:18.174
先等我喘口气
Once I've caught my breath.


1543
02:19:32.354 --> 02:19:35.316
看到这玩意的人都不能活着离开
No one who's seen this leaves the field.


1544
02:19:43.616 --> 02:19:45.117
好吧
All right.


1545
02:19:48.662 --> 02:19:50.164
我们把它藏起来
We hide it.


1546
02:19:50.873 --> 02:19:52.374
然后再自我了断
We end our lives.


1547
02:19:53.167 --> 02:19:55.377
这是唯一确定的方法
That's the only way to be sure.


1548
02:19:57.129 --> 02:19:59.006
至于何时自杀
As to when...


1549
02:19:59.256 --> 02:20:01.801
也许就让每个人自己决定
maybe that's every man's decision to make for himself.


1550
02:20:02.927 --> 02:20:04.220
你不杀我们？
You're not gonna kill us?


1551
02:20:04.386 --> 02:20:06.764
我找到你们就会
If I ever find you, I will.


1552
02:20:06.847 --> 02:20:08.557
但你不会努力找吧？
But you won't look too hard?


1553
02:20:09.433 --> 02:20:10.601
当然会
Yes, I will.


1554
02:20:14.355 --> 02:20:16.398
你不会回伦敦找凯特吧？
You're not going back to London to check on Kat, are you?


1555
02:20:16.482 --> 02:20:19.026
不会 太危险了
No. It's far too dangerous.


1556
02:20:19.860 --> 02:20:21.612
远远看她也不会？
Even from afar?


1557
02:20:22.696 --> 02:20:24.115
不会
Even from afar.


1558
02:20:26.408 --> 02:20:27.576
艾佛斯
Ives!


1559
02:20:28.577 --> 02:20:29.829
等等
Wait.


1560
02:20:36.168 --> 02:20:37.753
你真的要再回去？
Are you really going back in?


1561
02:20:40.589 --> 02:20:43.592
只有我能及时把门打开 对吧？
I'm the only one who could've got that door open in time, right, Ives?


1562
02:20:43.801 --> 02:20:46.262
你是最高竿的锁匠
Well, I don't know any locksmiths as good as you.


1563
02:20:47.721 --> 02:20:48.806
听到吗？
See?


1564
02:20:49.557 --> 02:20:51.392
又是我在里面
It's me in there, again.


1565
02:20:51.892 --> 02:20:54.937
为了这项任务创造另一个过去
Weaving another past in the fabric of this mission.


1566
02:21:03.487 --> 02:21:04.447
尼尔 等等
Neil, wait!


1567
02:21:08.868 --> 02:21:10.703
我们才刚拯救世界
Just saved the world.


1568
02:21:10.995 --> 02:21:12.913
不能留下任何风险
Can't leave anything to chance.


1569
02:21:13.497 --> 02:21:16.000
但我们做法不同会改变什么吗？
But can we change things if we do it differently?


1570
02:21:16.417 --> 02:21:18.627
发生过的已经发生了
"What's happened's happened."


1571
02:21:18.794 --> 02:21:21.797
这是对这个世界运作的信念
Which is an expression of faith in the mechanics of the world.


1572
02:21:22.381 --> 02:21:24.175
而不是袖手旁观的藉口
It's not an excuse to do nothing.


1573
02:21:24.592 --> 02:21:25.426
宿命？
Fate?


1574
02:21:25.593 --> 02:21:26.927
随你怎么说
Call it what you want.


1575
02:21:27.303 --> 02:21:28.512
你会怎么说？
What do you call it?


1576
02:21:29.263 --> 02:21:30.389
现实
Reality.


1577
02:21:33.058 --> 02:21:34.351
让我走吧
Now let me go.


1578
02:21:40.065 --> 02:21:42.610
你一直没说是谁找你来的 尼尔
Hey, you never did tell me who recruited you, Neil.


1579
02:21:42.777 --> 02:21:44.737
你到现在还没猜到？
Haven't you guessed by now?


1580
02:21:45.446 --> 02:21:46.405
是你啊
You did.


1581
02:21:46.989 --> 02:21:49.533
只是跟你原来想的不一样
Only not when you thought.


1582
02:21:49.867 --> 02:21:52.203
你在过去有个未来
You have a future in the past.


1583
02:21:52.369 --> 02:21:55.331
对我来说是多年前 对你来说是多年后
Years ago for me. Years from now for you.


1584
02:21:56.415 --> 02:21:58.000
你认识我很多年了？
You've known me for years?


1585
02:21:59.668 --> 02:22:03.464
对我来说 这是一段美好友情的结束
For me, I think this is the end of a beautiful friendship.


1586
02:22:03.547 --> 02:22:05.633
但对我来说 这只是开始
But for me, it's just the beginning.


1587
02:22:06.133 --> 02:22:08.052
我们一起干了一些事
We get up to some stuff.


1588
02:22:08.469 --> 02:22:10.930
你一定会喜欢 等着瞧
You're gonna love it. You'll see.


1589
02:22:11.806 --> 02:22:14.266
整项任务都是时间钳形攻势
This whole operation's a temporal pincer.


1590
02:22:14.642 --> 02:22:15.893
谁的任务？
Whose?


1591
02:22:17.311 --> 02:22:18.896
你的
Yours!


1592
02:22:19.021 --> 02:22:20.564
你才完成一半
You're only halfway there.


1593
02:22:20.648 --> 02:22:22.608
我会在一开始见你 朋友
I'll see you at the beginning, friend.


1594
02:22:31.408 --> 02:22:34.578
我们拯救了可能走向灭亡的世界
We're the people saving the world from what might have been.


1595
02:22:34.662 --> 02:22:36.455
世人将永远不知道这件事
World will never know what could've happened.


1596
02:22:38.499 --> 02:22:41.293
就算知道也不会在乎
And even if they did, they wouldn't care.


1597
02:22:45.631 --> 02:22:47.883
因为没人在乎没引爆的炸弹
'Cause no one cares about the bomb that didn't go off.


1598
02:22:47.967 --> 02:22:48.884
（坎农街3号）

1599
02:22:48.968 --> 02:22:50.928
只有拯救世界的人才知道
Only the one that did.


1600
02:22:53.264 --> 02:22:54.682
在孩子出来前动手
Do it before the boy comes out.


1601
02:22:57.309 --> 02:23:00.354
这算是慈悲？你答应过我
That's your idea of mercy? You gave me your word.


1602
02:23:00.521 --> 02:23:03.566
我当时也告诉你要付出代价
And I told you then what it would be worth.


1603
02:23:04.066 --> 02:23:05.943
这里 就在今天
Here, today.


1604
02:23:07.319 --> 02:23:08.821
你怎么知道？
How did you know?


1605
02:23:10.948 --> 02:23:13.534
坎农街 下午3点 大概没什么
Cannon Place, 3:00. Probably nothing, I'm...


1606
02:23:14.034 --> 02:23:14.869
后代
Posterity.


1607
02:23:15.035 --> 02:23:18.539
坎农街 下午3点 大概没什么
Cannon Place, 3:00. Probably nothing, I'm...


1608
02:23:19.373 --> 02:23:22.501
我跟你说过 你得开始以不同角度看这世界
I told you you'd have to start looking differently at the world.


1609
02:23:23.169 --> 02:23:26.130
-我必须清理善后 -那从来都不是你的责任
- I have to tie up the loose ends. - That was never your job.


1610
02:23:26.213 --> 02:23:27.173
那是谁的？
Then whose was it?


1611
02:23:27.339 --> 02:23:28.758
我的
Mine.


1612
02:23:28.841 --> 02:23:32.219
我发现我不替你工作 我们一直都在替我工作
