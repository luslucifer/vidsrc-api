00:09:19.720 --> 00:09:20.720
Where's your jacket?

2
00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:22.600
Hey!

3
00:09:23.240 --> 00:09:26.040
- Can't you give us a hand?
- I've got homework.


4
00:11:41.520 --> 00:11:42.520
Hey.

5
00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:44.200
What are you doing?

6
00:11:44.560 --> 00:11:45.560
Nothing.

7
00:11:45.760 --> 00:11:47.280
Why don't you come downstairs?

8
00:11:47.680 --> 00:11:48.840
We're watching a game.

9
00:11:49.720 --> 00:11:50.720
No I'm alright.

10
00:11:52.760 --> 00:11:53.760
You sure?

11
00:11:53.960 --> 00:11:55.760
Come on...
It's a good game.


12
00:11:56.720 --> 00:11:59.200
- I don't really like football.
- Listen if you just...


13
00:14:48.560 --> 00:14:50.840
How many times have I got to try?

14
00:14:51.280 --> 00:14:53.280
Every time I try
to talk to him...


15
00:17:04.840 --> 00:17:05.840
Come on.

16
00:17:19.400 --> 00:17:21.680
Oh, no, wait wait wait.

17
00:17:21.880 --> 00:17:22.880
Erm...

18
00:17:29.520 --> 00:17:31.000
Can you play with...

19
00:17:31.400 --> 00:17:32.440
Look at that!

20
00:17:43.880 --> 00:17:45.200
Blaine!

21
00:17:51.120 --> 00:17:52.720
Don't worry.

22
00:17:56.280 --> 00:17:57.280
Blaine!

23
00:17:59.520 --> 00:18:01.480
Calm down. Calm down!
It's not you.


24
00:18:01.560 --> 00:18:02.560
Blaine!

25
00:18:03.440 --> 00:18:04.440
Hey...

26
00:18:43.280 --> 00:18:44.320
What's wrong?

27
00:18:45.120 --> 00:18:46.120
Look at me.

28
00:18:48.880 --> 00:18:51.120
Shhh...

29
00:19:00.560 --> 00:19:01.560
Look at me.

30
00:19:02.320 --> 00:19:03.320
You're safe.

31
00:19:04.240 --> 00:19:05.680
You're safe with me, okay?

32
00:19:06.520 --> 00:19:07.560
Come on...

33
00:19:10.520 --> 00:19:11.520
Come on.

34
00:19:40.840 --> 00:19:41.880
It's late.

35
00:19:48.640 --> 00:19:50.520
- Where have you been?
- Out.


36
00:19:52.080 --> 00:19:53.160
With who?

37
00:19:53.320 --> 00:19:54.600
Why are you in my room?

38
00:19:54.920 --> 00:19:56.840
You don't talk to
me like that, Josh!


39
00:19:56.960 --> 00:19:58.080
I'm your father!

40
00:19:58.160 --> 00:19:59.480
This is my house!

41
00:20:01.080 --> 00:20:02.640
I tried, Josh!

42
00:20:02.720 --> 00:20:04.480
I tried and tried!

43
00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:06.919
You're not the only one
she fucking left!


44
00:20:06.920 --> 00:20:08.680
I wish you'd left!

45
00:20:15.680 --> 00:20:18.840
You'll stay in this room
until I tell you otherwise.


46
00:21:55.920 --> 00:21:56.920
Josh?

47
00:22:58.160 --> 00:22:59.240
Josh!

48
00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:06.000
Josh!?

49
00:23:34.920 --> 00:23:35.800
Oi!

50
00:23:35.920 --> 00:23:36.920
Come here!

51
00:23:37.160 --> 00:23:37.880
Come...

52
00:23:37.880 --> 00:23:38.880
here!

53
00:23:39.120 --> 00:23:40.760
Did you think I wouldn't find you?

54
00:23:45.560 --> 00:23:46.960
You thought you could leave.

55
00:23:47.520 --> 00:23:48.720
You're coming with me.

56
00:23:48.800 --> 00:23:50.480
You're coming back with me!

57
00:24:13.160 --> 00:24:15.080
So what about Harkstead?

58
00:24:15.320 --> 00:24:16.240
We could venture out that way.

59
00:24:16.320 --> 00:24:17.320
I guess...

60
00:24:17.840 --> 00:24:20.279
It's just all guesswork really.

61
00:24:20.280 --> 00:24:22.000
But, you know, that's the last...

62
00:24:49.800 --> 00:24:50.800
Blaine...

63
00:24:52.160 --> 00:24:54.160
You need to go with
these people now.


64
00:24:58.560 --> 00:24:59.680
It's ok, son.

65
00:27:18.760 --> 00:27:21.400
- All right? You're not bored?
- No, I'm fine.


66
00:27:22.160 --> 00:27:24.400
Don't be scared.
Go talk to people.


67
00:27:24.520 --> 00:27:26.920
I'm not scared.
It's just...


68
00:27:30.800 --> 00:27:32.640
Can you give me a sec?
I'll be right back.


69
00:29:08.080 --> 00:29:09.240
I'm bad at dancing.

70
00:29:10.800 --> 00:29:11.800
No.

71
00:29:12.600 --> 00:29:13.600
Not at all.

72
00:29:17.320 --> 00:29:18.320
I'm so bored.

73
00:29:20.280 --> 00:29:21.280
Yeah, me too.

74
00:29:22.760 --> 00:29:23.960
Wanna leave?

75
00:29:39.160 --> 00:29:40.360
What's your name?

76
00:29:42.600 --> 00:29:43.600
Aurélien.

77
00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:47.000
And you?

78
00:29:47.240 --> 00:29:48.240
Johnny.

79
00:29:49.080 --> 00:29:50.200
Like Johnny Cash.

80
00:29:52.280 --> 00:29:53.400
You new here?

81
00:29:54.920 --> 00:29:55.920
Yeah.

82
00:29:57.640 --> 00:29:58.640
I'm from Brittany.

83
00:30:00.440 --> 00:30:01.640
I've only been here a month.

84
00:30:03.360 --> 00:30:04.680
You should've stayed.

85
00:30:05.720 --> 00:30:07.440
People here are real assholes.

86
00:30:08.320 --> 00:30:10.400
I haven't made a single
friend in 10 years.


87
00:30:13.920 --> 00:30:15.080
Why stay then?

88
00:30:17.360 --> 00:30:18.920
I've only got Suze.

89
00:30:19.560 --> 00:30:20.560
That's great.

90
00:30:21.480 --> 00:30:23.640
I won't stay long.
I have to be up early.


91
00:30:38.800 --> 00:30:41.880
I've only got one glass.
You can use it if you like.


92
00:30:42.560 --> 00:30:43.560
Thanks.

93
00:30:45.800 --> 00:30:47.280
You read this sort of thing?

94
00:30:51.280 --> 00:30:52.280
I used to be a florist.

95
00:30:56.920 --> 00:30:58.200
It didn't work out.

96
00:31:03.360 --> 00:31:04.360
Why?

97
00:31:05.240 --> 00:31:07.440
I messed up my chance.

98
00:31:12.240 --> 00:31:13.240
That's not so bad.

99
00:31:14.320 --> 00:31:16.160
It's better not to do it, right?

100
00:31:18.320 --> 00:31:19.320
I don't know.

101
00:31:21.200 --> 00:31:24.520
Past a certain age, it
all seems a little silly.


102
00:31:27.920 --> 00:31:28.920
Anyway...

103
00:31:30.240 --> 00:31:31.240
Cheers.

104
00:31:51.360 --> 00:31:54.360
It's funny. You don't
look like a florist.


105
00:31:55.240 --> 00:31:56.240
Oh yeah?

106
00:31:57.800 --> 00:31:59.240
What do I look like?

107
00:32:00.760 --> 00:32:02.000
I don't know.

108
00:32:02.080 --> 00:32:04.480
I don't have any
great ambitions.


109
00:32:05.880 --> 00:32:07.120
Hold on, I'll show you...

110
00:32:15.880 --> 00:32:17.360
This is what I want.

111
00:32:18.680 --> 00:32:20.200
To build my own house.

112
00:32:21.880 --> 00:32:23.280
That's all that matters.

113
00:32:29.720 --> 00:32:31.120
Looks pretty good.

114
00:32:56.520 --> 00:32:58.200
Screw you, bitch!

115
00:32:58.440 --> 00:33:00.880
You're so annoying,
you fucking bitch!


116
00:33:01.160 --> 00:33:02.160
Fuck!

117
00:33:36.560 --> 00:33:38.040
Come on, tell me.

118
00:33:38.200 --> 00:33:40.000
What do you want me to say?

119
00:33:40.160 --> 00:33:42.640
We had some drinks,
I drank too much,


120
00:33:42.800 --> 00:33:45.080
I passed out on the floor...

121
00:33:46.080 --> 00:33:49.400
That's so gross, Aurélien.
What happened in the morning?


122
00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:51.000
Nothing.

123
00:33:51.880 --> 00:33:53.600
I left before he woke up.

124
00:33:54.800 --> 00:33:56.160
What a beautiful story!

125
00:33:57.640 --> 00:33:59.600
You really are scared
of everything, you know?


126
00:34:00.080 --> 00:34:02.160
Emma, can you stop
saying I'm scared?


127
00:34:02.480 --> 00:34:03.480
Chill out.

128
00:34:04.600 --> 00:34:05.840
Don't get wound up.

129
00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:15.480
How do you know Johnny?

130
00:34:17.120 --> 00:34:18.440
I see him on nights out.

131
00:34:19.560 --> 00:34:21.280
I know him more by reputation.

132
00:34:22.880 --> 00:34:24.120
He's a little...

133
00:34:25.640 --> 00:34:26.640
Wild.

134
00:34:27.600 --> 00:34:28.960
But he's not a bad guy.

135
00:34:33.520 --> 00:34:38.320
Would you rather die on the
Titanic or in the Twin Towers?


136
00:34:38.600 --> 00:34:40.000
Would you rather fly or swim?

137
00:34:43.360 --> 00:34:45.240
- Come on, choose!
- Hey...


138
00:34:45.960 --> 00:34:47.800
- All right?
- Yeah, all right.


139
00:34:48.760 --> 00:34:50.640
- I like your scarf.
- Thanks.


140
00:34:50.920 --> 00:34:52.280
Hi, Johnny.

141
00:34:54.560 --> 00:34:55.560
Hey.

142
00:34:56.640 --> 00:34:57.880
What's your...

143
00:34:58.160 --> 00:34:59.560
What's your name again?

144
00:35:00.320 --> 00:35:01.640
Aurélien.

145
00:35:03.280 --> 00:35:05.480
Sorry about last night.

146
00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:10.040
I hope I wasn't being an idiot.

147
00:35:10.280 --> 00:35:11.480
No, not at all.

148
00:35:12.360 --> 00:35:13.720
Not at all.

149
00:35:13.880 --> 00:35:14.920
Cool.

150
00:35:18.800 --> 00:35:19.880
Shall we?

151
00:35:59.720 --> 00:36:01.640
Look! Johnny's
flat on his ass!


152
00:36:16.360 --> 00:36:17.360
Here...

153
00:36:18.400 --> 00:36:20.600
Johnny, look at me.
What have you taken?


154
00:36:25.200 --> 00:36:27.160
It'll be OK.
We'll go to the ER.


155
00:36:51.440 --> 00:36:52.440
Let me see...

156
00:37:28.880 --> 00:37:30.280
I don't have ambitions.

157
00:37:34.200 --> 00:37:35.200
An ambition.

158
00:37:37.080 --> 00:37:38.400
Like you, with your house.

159
00:37:39.760 --> 00:37:40.880
I don't have that.

160
00:37:42.920 --> 00:37:43.920
I've got nothing.

161
00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:46.200
I haven't got a clue.

162
00:37:48.960 --> 00:37:50.160
You'll get there.

163
00:37:54.280 --> 00:37:55.400
I'm not so sure.

164
00:37:57.360 --> 00:37:59.400
I'm quite realistic
about myself.


165
00:38:01.440 --> 00:38:02.880
I have no great ambitions.

166
00:38:03.440 --> 00:38:05.800
No great ambitions,
no small ambitions.


167
00:38:09.120 --> 00:38:11.560
I'm just here,
wandering like a ghost.


168
00:38:18.240 --> 00:38:19.400
I have no purpose.

169
00:38:23.160 --> 00:38:24.200
You know...

170
00:38:28.280 --> 00:38:31.400
Some things are important
because they have no purpose.


171
00:39:01.960 --> 00:39:03.360
You're my friend, Aurélien.

172
00:39:15.920 --> 00:39:17.000
I know.

173
00:39:20.120 --> 00:39:21.160
I'm sorry.

174
00:39:50.520 --> 00:39:52.480
One, two, three...

175
00:39:55.040 --> 00:39:56.280
Another!

176
00:39:58.600 --> 00:39:59.960
It burns your insides!

177
00:40:00.120 --> 00:40:01.720
- Again? No!
- Of course!


178
00:40:01.800 --> 00:40:03.920
- No, we're done.
- Whatever...


179
00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:06.360
Aurélien, you too.
Tonight's our night!


180
00:40:06.440 --> 00:40:08.880
- This isn't happening.
- Keep pouring.


181
00:40:08.960 --> 00:40:11.280
We're going to hell.
OK, let's do it.


182
00:40:12.560 --> 00:40:15.360
- One, two, three...
- It's on!


183
00:40:54.760 --> 00:40:57.960
Hey, I'm meeting friends.
See you at the after party?


184
00:40:58.040 --> 00:40:59.160
Sure, no worries.

185
00:41:01.480 --> 00:41:05.800
Your outfit's nice. What is it?
Did you get it in the sales?


186
00:42:22.200 --> 00:42:23.440
Stop. You're a bad kisser.

187
00:42:28.280 --> 00:42:31.960
Commercial music is the worst!
I only listen to techno...


188
00:42:32.840 --> 00:42:35.960
And that weirdo who
was hitting on you!


189
00:42:36.040 --> 00:42:38.360
What was his name?

190
00:42:38.920 --> 00:42:41.800
- Catfish!
- Oh yeah! Catfish!


191
00:42:43.360 --> 00:42:45.840
- Hey.
- Hi.


192
00:43:04.720 --> 00:43:06.600
It wasn't your night then.

193
00:43:06.920 --> 00:43:09.160
No, not really.

194
00:43:10.400 --> 00:43:12.680
It's no use getting
ahead of yourself.


195
00:43:13.880 --> 00:43:15.040
Who are you talking about?

196
00:43:16.560 --> 00:43:17.560
Johnny.

197
00:43:18.120 --> 00:43:20.840
He says it's an
"homage" to Johnny Cash,


198
00:43:20.920 --> 00:43:24.200
but he's just some goon
who likes Johnny Hallyday!


199
00:43:27.920 --> 00:43:29.000
Fucking bitch...

200
00:43:46.280 --> 00:43:47.280
Aurélien?

201
00:43:50.920 --> 00:43:53.080
I think I'm done with parties.

202
00:44:05.800 --> 00:44:07.160
Thanks for the taxi.

203
00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:09.000
No worries.

204
00:44:16.880 --> 00:44:18.560
I'd marry you in a heartbeat.

205
00:45:15.400 --> 00:45:18.040
You drink too slow!
Like an old lady.


206
00:45:20.400 --> 00:45:22.800
- You drink like a drunk.
- What's that?


207
00:45:26.320 --> 00:45:27.320
Nothing.

208
00:45:30.080 --> 00:45:31.080
Nothing...

209
00:45:33.160 --> 00:45:34.440
I prefer it that way.

210
00:45:41.400 --> 00:45:44.280
Nothing to say?
Do I scare you?


211
00:45:45.240 --> 00:45:46.560
You don't scare me.

212
00:45:49.120 --> 00:45:51.320
Aurélien, stop being weak.

213
00:45:51.440 --> 00:45:53.600
- Stand up for yourself!
- Stop...


214
00:45:53.680 --> 00:45:55.279
- Come on...
- That hurts!


215
00:45:55.280 --> 00:45:56.960
Fucking hell! Stand up!

216
00:45:57.200 --> 00:46:00.200
Stand up. Show me you're a man.

217
00:46:00.280 --> 00:46:03.280
A real man. Show me
you're not scared...


218
00:46:03.360 --> 00:46:06.480
What do you want?
You want me to hit you?


219
00:46:06.560 --> 00:46:07.560
- Go on!
- Fine!


220
00:46:08.440 --> 00:46:11.200
Is that it? To show
you I'm not scared?


221
00:46:11.280 --> 00:46:12.840
I'm not fucking scared!

222
00:46:24.720 --> 00:46:26.160
You're a wild one.

223
00:46:31.600 --> 00:46:33.000
Sorry, I just...

224
00:46:34.720 --> 00:46:37.400
That was dumb. I didn't
mean anything by it.


225
00:46:39.800 --> 00:46:42.120
Come on, let's go.
I want to party.


226
00:47:03.840 --> 00:47:06.040
Hey, watch where you're going.

227
00:47:06.240 --> 00:47:08.440
He's drunk, just leave it...

228
00:47:08.640 --> 00:47:10.840
- Talk to me.
- Who are you?


229
00:47:10.920 --> 00:47:13.480
- Leave him alone...
- Stay out of this.


230
00:48:06.560 --> 00:48:08.440
It's over, Aurélien.
Don't worry.


231
00:48:34.480 --> 00:48:35.480
All right?

232
00:48:42.960 --> 00:48:44.080
Do you want a coffee?

233
00:48:46.840 --> 00:48:47.840
Sure.

234
00:49:44.800 --> 00:49:46.360
This is going to sting.

235
00:49:54.440 --> 00:49:55.760
You're really messed up.

236
00:49:57.560 --> 00:49:58.960
I don't recognise myself.

237
00:50:04.200 --> 00:50:05.840
Thanks for last night.

238
00:50:07.800 --> 00:50:09.080
For sticking up for me.

239
00:50:13.960 --> 00:50:15.640
I've never been
in a fight before.


240
00:50:20.520 --> 00:50:22.240
I make you do stupid things.

241
00:51:49.000 --> 00:51:52.280
Okay, make a bit of distance between you?

242
00:51:52.800 --> 00:51:53.840
Now look up.

243
00:51:55.300 --> 00:51:56.990
Put your hand down, Philip.

244
00:52:00.880 --> 00:52:02.976
This is so what I'm looking for.
So give me something else.


245
00:52:03.000 --> 00:52:04.120
Give me some more.

246
00:53:11.400 --> 00:53:12.600
I like a more feminine tone.

247
00:53:13.320 --> 00:53:15.280
Like I said though,
the lighting is just really...


248
00:53:15.320 --> 00:53:16.960
I know.
She's fantastic.


249
00:53:17.560 --> 00:53:18.600
It's perfect.

250
00:53:19.280 --> 00:53:21.320
Maybe you can try a
combination of them both.


251
00:53:23.360 --> 00:53:24.480
Have them together.

252
00:53:24.680 --> 00:53:26.400
Yes, I like them together.

253
00:53:27.240 --> 00:53:28.480
The natural look.

254
00:53:29.120 --> 00:53:30.160
Excuse me.

255
00:53:31.480 --> 00:53:33.560
- That one and that one.
- Thanks.


256
00:53:34.120 --> 00:53:36.240
- Sorry about that.
- These ones.


257
00:53:37.480 --> 00:53:39.200
A little bit more to
the camera please?


258
00:53:41.200 --> 00:53:42.320
Yeah that's good.

259
00:53:42.400 --> 00:53:43.400
Try this one on.

260
00:53:44.440 --> 00:53:46.000
Oh yeah, thank you.

261
00:53:46.080 --> 00:53:48.400
Change for this one instead.

262
00:53:48.480 --> 00:53:49.840
Aaron? Can you
come here please?


263
00:53:50.120 --> 00:53:52.416
- Thank you Thomas you may go.
- Can you take your shirt off?


264
00:53:52.440 --> 00:53:55.880
Erm, if you finish off with
Aaron, I'll go get Michael.


265
00:53:56.320 --> 00:53:58.320
Weyland. Yes?
Okay. Alright.


266
00:54:05.560 --> 00:54:07.600
- Are you from Cynk?
- No.


267
00:54:07.840 --> 00:54:10.320
If you wait, we'll be
with you in a second.


268
00:54:10.400 --> 00:54:12.760
- Erm, Michael Weyland?
- Here.


269
00:54:12.920 --> 00:54:14.760
If you come this way,
please. Thank you.


270
00:54:25.160 --> 00:54:28.960
Excuse me. But you have to
wait outside until it's your turn.


271
00:54:29.520 --> 00:54:30.640
Thank you.

272
00:56:02.760 --> 00:56:05.520
Unfortunately we're running
out of time, so...


273
00:56:05.600 --> 00:56:07.120
we'll be in touch
with the agencies.


274
00:56:07.200 --> 00:56:09.160
If you could all make
your way to the exit.


275
00:56:09.240 --> 00:56:10.240
Thank you.

276
00:56:16.000 --> 00:56:17.520
Yes it went great.

277
00:56:18.400 --> 00:56:20.240
We're just wrapping up here.

278
00:56:22.120 --> 00:56:23.280
For sure.

279
00:56:24.040 --> 00:56:25.600
No I won't have time for that.

280
00:56:27.800 --> 00:56:29.000
Sure, bye.

281
00:56:50.440 --> 00:56:51.840
The casting's closed.

282
00:56:51.920 --> 00:56:53.120
Are you sure about that?

283
00:56:54.000 --> 00:56:55.000
Yes.

284
00:56:55.280 --> 00:56:56.880
We found our model.

285
00:57:15.880 --> 00:57:17.240
Are these your pictures?

286
00:57:18.000 --> 00:57:19.760
Having trouble finding the exit?

287
00:57:24.280 --> 00:57:25.960
They're really interesting.

288
00:57:32.280 --> 00:57:33.920
I'm heading home.
Are you staying?


289
00:57:34.000 --> 00:57:35.400
Yeah. Thanks for today.

290
00:57:35.600 --> 00:57:36.920
Yeah. See you.

291
00:57:41.720 --> 00:57:42.960
Stand over there.

292
00:58:03.400 --> 00:58:04.440
Over here?

293
00:58:05.640 --> 00:58:06.640
Mhm.

294
00:58:07.520 --> 00:58:09.360
- What's your name?
- Philip Berg.


295
00:58:09.440 --> 00:58:10.440
OK.

296
00:58:11.240 --> 00:58:12.880
Start by exhaling.

297
00:58:14.280 --> 00:58:15.280
Lean back.

298
00:58:17.680 --> 00:58:18.840
Chin up.

299
00:58:21.160 --> 00:58:22.160
Good.

300
00:58:29.120 --> 00:58:30.120
Hi.

301
00:58:31.000 --> 00:58:32.200
They're on the table.

302
00:58:51.880 --> 00:58:53.560
Okay! Thanks.

303
00:58:55.400 --> 00:58:56.720
Just give me a minute.

304
00:59:09.440 --> 00:59:10.800
- Hey.
- Hi.


305
00:59:10.880 --> 00:59:12.280
- Sebastian.
- Philip.


306
00:59:12.360 --> 00:59:13.560
You did great, man.

307
00:59:14.200 --> 00:59:16.880
- She didn't like me.
- I do. You look good.


308
00:59:18.040 --> 00:59:19.040
Thanks.

309
00:59:19.400 --> 00:59:21.240
I've seen your work.
You're great.


310
00:59:22.120 --> 00:59:24.440
- So you work with Chloe?
- Not really.


311
00:59:24.520 --> 00:59:25.800
I recognize you.

312
00:59:26.880 --> 00:59:27.880
Liar.

313
00:59:29.880 --> 00:59:31.320
So you've been doing this long?

314
00:59:31.400 --> 00:59:32.440
Not so long.

315
00:59:35.120 --> 00:59:36.920
What about you?
Where are you from?


316
00:59:37.360 --> 00:59:39.200
The Netherlands. Amsterdam.

317
00:59:39.360 --> 00:59:41.360
- Yeah? Cool.
- I like it better here.


318
00:59:41.440 --> 00:59:43.360
- Really?
- People are more fashionable.


319
00:59:43.440 --> 00:59:45.600
- How long have you been here?
- About a year now.


320
00:59:46.600 --> 00:59:49.000
I travel around a lot so I
don't really keep track...


321
00:59:51.040 --> 00:59:52.040
Guys?

322
00:59:54.640 --> 00:59:56.360
See? She likes you.

323
01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:13.600
- You try this.
- I found that one for you.


324
01:00:13.960 --> 01:00:15.920
- This one?
- Okay...


325
01:00:16.520 --> 01:00:17.600
You try that one.

326
01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:19.000
It's a deal.

327
01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:21.680
Not that one!
That one's mine.


328
01:00:23.560 --> 01:00:24.560
Is it nice?

329
01:00:26.120 --> 01:00:27.440
- Is it?
- Yeah.


330
01:00:27.800 --> 01:00:29.640
Okay, let's take it off.

331
01:00:30.440 --> 01:00:32.440
Look at yourself...

332
01:00:38.640 --> 01:00:40.960
You look good.
Why so serious?


333
01:00:43.560 --> 01:00:45.960
Because this is serious.

334
01:00:47.920 --> 01:00:49.440
That's amazing.

335
01:01:23.520 --> 01:01:25.880
Good. Bastian can you
turn forward please?


336
01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:33.040
Okay really good.
Take one more step.


337
01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:36.280
Philip, step back.

338
01:01:37.200 --> 01:01:38.480
Like this?

339
01:01:39.680 --> 01:01:40.760
Out of the shot.

340
01:01:47.080 --> 01:01:48.400
Here we go. Look up.

341
01:01:49.880 --> 01:01:51.000
Lovely.

342
01:01:52.080 --> 01:01:54.040
Good! That's a hot one.

343
01:02:00.280 --> 01:02:02.800
- You like this?
- That's great.


344
01:02:04.880 --> 01:02:05.880
Beautiful.

345
01:02:16.520 --> 01:02:17.720
Beautiful.

346
01:02:20.440 --> 01:02:22.080
You're killing me Bas. Great!

347
01:02:22.720 --> 01:02:23.800
You like this?

348
01:02:24.600 --> 01:02:25.840
I do!

349
01:02:26.640 --> 01:02:27.880
Sebastian, come on.

350
01:02:28.600 --> 01:02:30.040
Okay, wait a minute.

351
01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:39.240
Here we go.

352
01:02:46.040 --> 01:02:47.800
Yeah, I like this.

353
01:02:55.560 --> 01:02:57.240
Beautiful. Come on,
give me more!


354
01:03:00.520 --> 01:03:03.240
Okay, fashion, guys?
Give me fashion.


355
01:03:03.800 --> 01:03:05.480
Bas, you know what I need.

356
01:03:13.320 --> 01:03:14.720
Beautiful.

357
01:03:17.440 --> 01:03:18.640
Turn up a little bit.

358
01:03:23.120 --> 01:03:25.000
Oh that's hot.

359
01:03:25.400 --> 01:03:27.440
You haven't seen
my best work yet.


360
01:03:28.080 --> 01:03:29.240
Let's see it.

361
01:03:33.640 --> 01:03:35.480
Not too bad, good!

362
01:03:35.800 --> 01:03:37.080
Philip!

363
01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:40.360
Okay, turn up a little.

364
01:03:44.760 --> 01:03:46.480
Okay I know where this is going.

365
01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:57.840
Oh that's so nice.

366
01:04:03.360 --> 01:04:04.640
Keep going.

367
01:04:08.440 --> 01:04:09.920
Okay, hold that one.

368
01:04:12.400 --> 01:04:13.920
Do you want to go further?

369
01:04:16.200 --> 01:04:17.640
Don't you wanna do it?

370
01:04:19.200 --> 01:04:20.200
Do you?

371
01:04:24.400 --> 01:04:25.560
Let's do it.

372
01:04:34.920 --> 01:04:37.760
- I don't know...
- That's fine. It's up to you.


373
01:04:39.600 --> 01:04:41.920
Some guy is asking
for you in there.


374
01:04:44.120 --> 01:04:45.560
What the hell?

375
01:04:46.880 --> 01:04:48.960
Since when do you
smoke that shit?


376
01:04:49.960 --> 01:04:50.960
Huh?

377
01:04:52.640 --> 01:04:53.640
Okay...

378
01:05:04.560 --> 01:05:06.120
Hey, man. What's up?

379
01:05:06.760 --> 01:05:09.520
Can I get you anything?
A drink? A beer?


380
01:05:09.600 --> 01:05:10.440
Can we talk?

381
01:05:10.520 --> 01:05:12.280
Yeah... sure.

382
01:05:14.120 --> 01:05:15.120
So what's up?

383
01:05:15.440 --> 01:05:16.080
I'm leaving.

384
01:05:16.160 --> 01:05:17.640
Oh you're going
back to Amsterdam?


385
01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:19.200
That's great, man.

386
01:05:19.760 --> 01:05:21.680
We need to talk about
what happened.


387
01:05:29.240 --> 01:05:30.240
Look...

388
01:05:30.920 --> 01:05:31.936
I should have called you back.

389
01:05:31.960 --> 01:05:33.080
I made a complaint.

390
01:05:36.400 --> 01:05:37.800
She pushed us, Philip.

391
01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:28.520
Wonderful.

392
01:06:38.800 --> 01:06:40.680
Can't we try a different background?

393
01:06:40.760 --> 01:06:41.880
No, this is fine.

394
01:06:54.880 --> 01:06:55.960
What?

395
01:06:56.320 --> 01:06:58.160
- What is it?
- Nothing.


396
01:09:53.280 --> 01:09:54.280
Come on...

397
01:09:58.280 --> 01:09:59.280
It's ok.

398
01:10:04.720 --> 01:10:06.720
- You wanted it.
- I did?


399
01:10:07.640 --> 01:10:09.360
If not, why didn't you say no?

400
01:10:09.600 --> 01:10:12.040
I didn't think it was my
responsibility to say no.


401
01:10:13.440 --> 01:10:14.560
I don't know...

402
01:10:14.680 --> 01:10:15.800
I have to work.

403
01:10:15.920 --> 01:10:18.560
You have to go to the police
and tell them what happened.


404
01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:21.000
I won't.

405
01:10:35.800 --> 01:10:37.160
Okay Philip, what
else do you got?


406
01:10:37.240 --> 01:10:39.320
Just give me something!
Something more. Come on.


407
01:10:41.360 --> 01:10:42.680
That's nice.

408
01:10:44.760 --> 01:10:47.000
I love that. Yes!

409
01:10:55.720 --> 01:10:56.760
Lovely.

410
01:10:57.920 --> 01:10:58.920
Okay, Philip.

411
01:10:59.400 --> 01:11:00.520
Give me something.

412
01:11:04.480 --> 01:11:05.480
No.

413
01:11:05.880 --> 01:11:08.240
That doesn't work.
Stand behind him.


414
01:11:08.480 --> 01:11:10.120
Good. Put that arm there.

415
01:11:10.200 --> 01:11:12.040
Oh yes! I like that one.

416
01:11:15.080 --> 01:11:16.080
Okay wait...

417
01:11:22.400 --> 01:11:23.800
Beautiful.

418
01:11:31.600 --> 01:11:32.640
No don't do that.

419
01:11:33.240 --> 01:11:34.680
I like it. Put it back.

420
01:11:35.200 --> 01:11:37.200
Put the hand back.
There we go.


421
01:11:39.880 --> 01:11:41.080
Yeah that's nice.

422
01:11:41.160 --> 01:11:42.480
Good one, Philip.

423
01:11:45.800 --> 01:11:46.800
Yeah.

424
01:11:48.080 --> 01:11:50.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
This is good.


425
01:11:50.120 --> 01:11:50.680
Okay, you know what?

426
01:11:50.760 --> 01:11:52.760
We're gonna go on,
and you drop the underwear.


427
01:11:57.800 --> 01:12:00.360
Hey it's going great!
It's going so good.


428
01:12:00.920 --> 01:12:02.000
Hey man.

429
01:12:02.320 --> 01:12:04.480
We're beautiful.
We're so beautiful!


430
01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:06.000
Hey, look...

431
01:12:06.760 --> 01:12:09.040
Man this is so good.
She loves it.


432
01:12:09.120 --> 01:12:10.880
She really really loves it.

433
01:12:12.360 --> 01:12:15.560
Oh man this is awesome.
This is so big, man.


434
01:12:15.880 --> 01:12:18.360
Us doing it, we're great.
You're beautiful.


435
01:12:18.680 --> 01:12:19.760
You look beautiful.

436
01:12:26.240 --> 01:12:27.240
Hey man...

437
01:12:28.160 --> 01:12:29.160
Beautiful.

438
01:12:36.840 --> 01:12:38.000
You know you're

439
01:12:38.480 --> 01:12:40.200
the best model I've ever seen?

440
01:12:41.080 --> 01:12:45.720
You're the nicest model
I've ever met in my whole life.


441
01:12:50.760 --> 01:12:51.800
Hey?

442
01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:54.160
Stop... stop it.

443
01:12:54.720 --> 01:12:56.920
Stop the rumor.

444
01:12:58.000 --> 01:12:59.360
Hey let's do it.

445
01:13:14.480 --> 01:13:16.880
Nice. Lovely.

446
01:13:25.280 --> 01:13:27.000
Lovely. Now look up.

447
01:13:27.400 --> 01:13:28.520
Good.

448
01:13:31.240 --> 01:13:32.240
Great.

449
01:13:32.400 --> 01:13:34.296
Okay you're doing good.
Just give me something more.


450
01:13:34.320 --> 01:13:35.600
Play with me now.

451
01:13:41.240 --> 01:13:43.200
Yes, yes! Love it.

452
01:13:43.280 --> 01:13:45.880
Keep it. Keep that one.
Keep that one.


453
01:13:51.520 --> 01:13:52.520
Still, Philip.

454
01:16:13.920 --> 01:16:14.920
Do you smoke?

455
01:16:15.800 --> 01:16:16.800
No.

456
01:16:24.880 --> 01:16:26.200
No, I got you.

457
01:16:26.280 --> 01:16:27.520
Okay, come on.

458
01:16:27.600 --> 01:16:28.840
I don't see it.

459
01:16:28.920 --> 01:16:29.920
What?

460
01:16:32.200 --> 01:16:33.720
I don't see you as a model.

461
01:16:38.600 --> 01:16:41.040
It's a compliment, man.
You can do whatever you wanna do.


462
01:16:41.120 --> 01:16:42.400
This is what I want to do.

463
01:16:42.480 --> 01:16:44.160
So you want to be a cover boy?

464
01:16:44.680 --> 01:16:45.960
I want to be...

465
01:16:47.280 --> 01:16:48.560
Someone.

466
01:17:02.640 --> 01:17:03.640
Seriously...

467
01:17:03.720 --> 01:17:04.720
Give it to me.

468
01:17:05.760 --> 01:17:06.760
Okay, ready?

469
01:17:10.800 --> 01:17:11.800
Come on.

470
01:17:12.360 --> 01:17:14.360
Okay, we have camera issues.
Are you ready?


471
01:17:16.960 --> 01:17:18.600
You think I'm naive, don't you?

472
01:17:18.680 --> 01:17:19.680
No.

473
01:17:20.440 --> 01:17:21.800
Yeah you do.

474
01:17:23.640 --> 01:17:24.920
You think that I'm...

475
01:17:25.240 --> 01:17:26.240
that I'm stupid.

476
01:17:27.320 --> 01:17:28.520
I think you're beautiful.

477
01:17:32.560 --> 01:17:33.560
Slowly...

478
01:17:35.800 --> 01:17:36.800
Can I have it?

479
01:18:26.640 --> 01:18:28.400
- Bonjour, ça va?
- Bonjour.


480
01:18:30.960 --> 01:18:33.280
Hi. The stylist is
waiting for you.


481
01:18:40.320 --> 01:18:41.520
I like that!

482
01:18:43.840 --> 01:18:45.040
Nice.

483
01:18:47.880 --> 01:18:49.400
- Hi.
- Hi.


484
01:18:49.920 --> 01:18:51.920
Okay, let's have a look...

485
01:18:58.480 --> 01:19:01.280
Okay one more time.
Now turn up.


486
01:20:35.800 --> 01:20:37.040
Hi my love.

487
01:20:38.680 --> 01:20:39.800
It's me.

488
01:20:42.040 --> 01:20:43.040
Mom.

489
01:20:59.600 --> 01:21:01.200
You may not think

490
01:21:03.240 --> 01:21:05.040
graduation is a big deal.

491
01:21:06.760 --> 01:21:07.760
But it is.

492
01:21:10.520 --> 01:21:12.160
Congratulations Manuel.

493
01:21:16.240 --> 01:21:17.440
Graduation,

494
01:21:18.560 --> 01:21:20.160
is the combination

495
01:21:20.320 --> 01:21:23.040
and celebration of
all your hard work,


496
01:21:23.680 --> 01:21:24.680
and growth.

497
01:21:27.960 --> 01:21:30.040
I am so proud of you.

498
01:21:39.520 --> 01:21:40.520
I hope

499
01:21:40.920 --> 01:21:41.920
these tapes

500
01:21:42.360 --> 01:21:43.720
make a difference.

501
01:22:43.720 --> 01:22:45.040
So what do you wanna do today?

502
01:22:48.240 --> 01:22:49.240
I dunno.

503
01:22:49.520 --> 01:22:50.520
It's your birthday.

504
01:22:58.000 --> 01:22:59.440
Well we can't stay here.

505
01:23:00.200 --> 01:23:01.640
We should get going pretty soon.

506
01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:07.000
Sure.

507
01:23:07.520 --> 01:23:08.800
Wherever you wanna go.

508
01:23:12.160 --> 01:23:13.440
I had fun last night.

509
01:23:17.560 --> 01:23:19.360
I'm glad I decided...

510
01:23:19.680 --> 01:23:20.720
to stay the night.

511
01:24:01.840 --> 01:24:02.840
Manuel!

512
01:24:04.800 --> 01:24:05.880
Manuel!

513
01:24:07.240 --> 01:24:08.240
I know

514
01:24:09.720 --> 01:24:12.120
your father has his
own ideas about


515
01:24:14.120 --> 01:24:15.760
what it means to be a man.

516
01:24:17.120 --> 01:24:18.680
I can try to teach you.

517
01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:26.340
I don't want to
speak ill of your father.

518
01:24:29.440 --> 01:24:31.520
But it's so important for me

519
01:24:32.280 --> 01:24:34.120
to make sure you know love.

520
01:24:40.480 --> 01:24:42.040
Of course,

521
01:24:42.320 --> 01:24:44.640
there's other stuff
I hope you'll learn.


522
01:24:45.680 --> 01:24:47.760
That are not as grand.

523
01:24:51.320 --> 01:24:53.600
Like shaving before a date. Hm?

524
01:24:55.840 --> 01:24:59.960
Just make sure you're not
scratching the person you love.


525
01:25:02.040 --> 01:25:03.040
Hey!

526
01:25:04.880 --> 01:25:06.960
Hey. Are you ok?

527
01:25:10.880 --> 01:25:11.880
Manny...

528
01:25:14.880 --> 01:25:16.399
He was gonna find out
about us at some point.


529
01:25:16.400 --> 01:25:17.640
Just gimme a minute.

530
01:25:18.920 --> 01:25:19.920
Manny...

531
01:25:21.400 --> 01:25:22.400
Manny!

532
01:25:24.520 --> 01:25:25.520
Hey.

533
01:25:27.080 --> 01:25:28.080
Listen.

534
01:25:30.160 --> 01:25:31.280
Just forget about it.

535
01:25:31.360 --> 01:25:32.440
Get off me!

536
01:26:01.680 --> 01:26:04.520
I'm sorry I can't be
there for you Manuel.


537
01:26:08.040 --> 01:26:10.320
I'm sorry I can't be there now.

538
01:26:16.080 --> 01:26:17.080
I just...

539
01:26:17.760 --> 01:26:19.760
want to watch you grow.

540
01:26:27.160 --> 01:26:29.280
I hate making these tapes!

541
01:26:31.280 --> 01:26:33.640
I don't want to leave you.

542
01:26:35.160 --> 01:26:37.120
I want to give you the world!

543
01:26:37.320 --> 01:26:38.920
You deserve the world.

544
01:26:45.720 --> 01:26:46.720
I just...

545
01:28:03.680 --> 01:28:04.680
Mommy?

546
01:28:05.560 --> 01:28:06.560
Yes Manito?

547
01:28:10.120 --> 01:28:12.960
- What happened Mommy?
- Nothing Manny.


548
01:28:13.400 --> 01:28:16.400
Mommy just had an accident.

549
01:28:18.520 --> 01:28:19.680
Are you ok?

550
01:28:35.280 --> 01:28:36.680
What's wrong with her?

551
01:28:39.280 --> 01:28:41.680
She doesn't feel very
good right now.


552
01:28:51.720 --> 01:28:52.720
Mommy?

553
01:28:54.040 --> 01:28:55.040
Mommy?

554
01:29:19.160 --> 01:29:20.160
Hello?

555
01:29:21.800 --> 01:29:24.440
- Hello?
- Hello, is this Manuel?


556
01:29:24.840 --> 01:29:25.960
Yeah this is him.

557
01:29:27.120 --> 01:29:28.120
Who's this?

558
01:29:28.560 --> 01:29:29.640
This is Carol.

559
01:29:30.760 --> 01:29:32.760
Your mother and
I were very close.


560
01:29:34.000 --> 01:29:35.000
Erm...

561
01:29:36.080 --> 01:29:37.840
I have something
I need to give you.


562
01:29:39.920 --> 01:29:41.680
Are you coming home soon?

563
01:31:17.880 --> 01:31:19.080
Hi my love.

564
01:31:20.840 --> 01:31:21.840
It's me.

565
01:31:22.720 --> 01:31:23.720
Mom.

566
01:31:27.600 --> 01:31:28.640
I have...

567
01:31:29.160 --> 01:31:31.040
so much to tell you.

568
01:31:35.600 --> 01:31:37.000
First thing's first.

569
01:31:38.680 --> 01:31:41.240
Happy Birthday Manuel!

570
01:31:43.000 --> 01:31:44.280
Are you ok?

571
01:31:48.800 --> 01:31:49.800
No.

572
01:31:53.400 --> 01:31:55.840
I'm not going to leave you.

573
01:31:59.240 --> 01:32:01.560
I love you with all my heart.

574
01:32:05.240 --> 01:32:07.320
A child needs to hear this

575
01:32:07.400 --> 01:32:08.840
as he grows up.

576
01:32:12.760 --> 01:32:16.280
And I know you may
not have heard that.


577
01:32:17.880 --> 01:32:18.880
Often...

578
01:32:22.680 --> 01:32:24.400
You're going to have to...

579
01:32:25.640 --> 01:32:26.640
grow up.

580
01:32:27.000 --> 01:32:28.440
Much faster

581
01:32:29.000 --> 01:32:30.800
than the people around you.

582
01:32:33.360 --> 01:32:34.360
But,

583
01:32:35.680 --> 01:32:37.200
I believe that

584
01:32:38.000 --> 01:32:39.000
only

585
01:32:39.320 --> 01:32:41.160
is going to make you stronger.

586
01:32:44.480 --> 01:32:46.280
There might be people

587
01:32:47.560 --> 01:32:48.560
who will

588
01:32:49.840 --> 01:32:52.520
- try to make you feel...
- Manuel!


589
01:32:52.760 --> 01:32:53.760
Tell you

590
01:32:54.280 --> 01:32:56.560
- you're not good.
- Where are you going!?


591
01:32:58.040 --> 01:32:59.080
But don't

592
01:32:59.480 --> 01:33:00.560
listen to them.

593
01:33:05.040 --> 01:33:06.320
You are!

594
01:33:12.520 --> 01:33:13.720
But remember,

595
01:33:15.200 --> 01:33:16.200
the love,

596
01:33:16.720 --> 01:33:17.760
the trust.

597
01:33:24.560 --> 01:33:25.600
Remember,

598
01:33:26.480 --> 01:33:29.520
you can overcome anything!

599
01:33:37.080 --> 01:33:38.360
Be free.

600
01:33:43.200 --> 01:33:44.280
Your life

601
01:33:44.680 --> 01:33:46.120
is yours.

602
01:33:58.200 --> 01:33:59.240
Live it!
