1
00:00:02.837 --> 00:00:09.927
Earth. It's hard to remember
the green forests and blue sea.

2
00:00:10.011 --> 00:00:14.891
After all human abuse struck latter again.

3
00:00:14.974 --> 00:00:18.186
In a series of natural disasters.

4
00:00:18.269 --> 00:00:25.067
Launched the earth a
kind of game against humanity.

5
00:00:25.151 --> 00:00:30.531
The sky was covered with ashes. 
The crops withered and died.

6
00:00:30.615 --> 00:00:35.995
The power supply collapsed
and the food chain collapsed.

7
00:00:36.078 --> 00:00:39.665
The hungry masses clashed.

8
00:00:39.749 --> 00:00:43.920
Governments struggled to maintain law and order.

9
00:00:44.003 --> 00:00:51.886
In this chaos came a scientific focus
with an escape plan into action.


10
00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:59.936
Ironically, that had collaborated in the
past was an escape plan ironically redundant.


11
00:01:00.019 --> 00:01:05.399
The pilgrimage began two questions persisted.

12
00:01:05.483 --> 00:01:11.823
Will take better care of the new
home and how you should take?


13
00:01:17.286 --> 00:01:21.666
The dust layer is thick enough here,
Weller research director.


14
00:01:21.749 --> 00:01:26.879
The Reiger killing if the block.

15
00:01:32.969 --> 00:01:40.184
- We have permission to be here?
- Soon you will be sacrificed to the volcano.


16
00:01:40.268 --> 00:01:43.479
There has been active for two million years.

17
00:01:46.441 --> 00:01:50.945
There is an outbreak, but a sandstorm.

18
00:01:51.028 --> 00:01:56.075
- Bryce?
- Get out of there! Get out there!


19
00:02:04.584 --> 00:02:08.588
The door is closed. Get ready. Come on.

20
00:02:15.219 --> 00:02:20.224
We should call the Reiger. 
The Foster should come here now.

21
00:02:20.308 --> 00:02:24.687
I can do it.

22
00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:37.230
Martian Land. (2015)

23
00:02:39.911 --> 00:02:45.124
- We have the park to ourselves.
- Most people have already been evacuated.


24
00:02:45.208 --> 00:02:50.129
Only security guards, the hospital
staff is with us again.

25
00:02:53.382 --> 00:02:55.426
- I get the last departure.
- I'm not leaving without you.


26
00:02:55.510 --> 00:03:00.973
Ellie, your mother is research director.
Concerned about the storm.


27
00:03:01.057 --> 00:03:04.644
When you are upset they are all there.

28
00:03:04.727 --> 00:03:11.150
This is discrimination, you have nothing to prove.

29
00:03:11.234 --> 00:03:14.862
That said, Take the first bus. 
We take the latter.

30
00:03:14.946 --> 00:03:19.117
thousands from all colonies have been emptied.

31
00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:24.580
I will not do in the
beginning, but because I can help.

32
00:03:24.664 --> 00:03:31.003
You need not concern us. 
The small colony Ern has no domes.

33
00:03:49.313 --> 00:03:53.484
If you leave, so people will think
that I have inside information.


34
00:03:53.568 --> 00:03:57.488
There you have it.

35
00:03:57.572 --> 00:04:01.993
- Should they turn red?
- Very funny.


36
00:04:09.709 --> 00:04:14.714
- Ellie, the boats are on the way!
- We get them. Come on!


37
00:04:28.603 --> 00:04:34.776
- Wait! there will be more people!
- Not anymore.


38
00:04:46.412 --> 00:04:51.584
They must be extremely tight, 
Doctor Foster.

39
00:04:51.667 --> 00:04:56.339
So as not to
break on Mars thy bones.

40
00:04:56.422 --> 00:05:01.803
From Earth. We traveled all the way.
Strangely, I'm not tired of you yet.


41
00:05:03.638 --> 00:05:09.102
With that said, 
I welcome you to Mars.

42
00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:18.653
- Sure you do not want to see it?
- Describe it to me.


43
00:05:24.992 --> 00:05:28.412
See this storm.

44
00:05:28.496 --> 00:05:32.667
New York of Mars is fully covered.

45
00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:46.097
I have to go around. 
It can be rough.

46
00:06:01.028 --> 00:06:07.535
Director Weller, we have heard the distress
frequencies. You should hear it.


47
00:06:09.328 --> 00:06:15.042
I'm Ellie Weller. My mother is
Miranda Weller, head of research.


48
00:06:15.126 --> 00:06:19.714
New York of Mars has been hit by
a sandstorm despite the dome.


49
00:06:19.797 --> 00:06:25.928
I and others we are in determining

50
00:06:26.012 --> 00:06:32.685
Answer. We can not stay away. In three
days we walk towards the tunnel.


51
00:06:32.908 --> 00:06:37.940
I asked her to take
off from there. Go away.

52
00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:57.043
185 days. As long as you ask me to wait
while you get a a better solution.


53
00:06:57.126 --> 00:07:01.172
Including recovery Doctor Foster.

54
00:07:01.255 --> 00:07:06.052
Put much faith in a man
who was in a dying planet.

55
00:07:06.135 --> 00:07:12.809
I do not like the decision, but it
was mine. It's part of the job.


56
00:07:12.892 --> 00:07:16.729
You Lead researcher Weller. 
You can stretch your powers.

57
00:07:16.813 --> 00:07:23.486
I have seen up close. 
Not ordinary sandstorm.

58
00:07:23.569 --> 00:07:29.450
- What makes this particular storm?
- I do not know. Therefore, we need to Foster.


59
00:07:29.534 --> 00:07:32.745
The same if anyone can stop her.

60
00:07:32.829 --> 00:07:36.624
Captain. Director. 
They are here.

61
00:07:42.922 --> 00:07:45.341
Are you okay, Doc?

62
00:07:47.176 --> 00:07:51.431
Yes. Take me to your leader.

63
00:07:51.514 --> 00:07:55.560
Miranda. Hello.

64
00:07:55.643 --> 00:07:59.230
Wonderful to see you.

65
00:08:01.107 --> 00:08:05.820
- Status update?
- The storm has already reached a volume.


66
00:08:05.903 --> 00:08:09.407
You have just landed with precision,
but you should start now.


67
00:08:09.490 --> 00:08:14.620
Wait a minute now. 
You are married;

68
00:08:14.704 --> 00:08:21.919
We traveled together for months and did not
mention that you were married to my ex-wife.


69
00:08:22.003 --> 00:08:25.798
It was my idea, 
I wanted to come.

70
00:08:25.882 --> 00:08:30.970
You're stubborn enough not to let the planets.

71
00:08:31.053 --> 00:08:36.642
Let the planets. 
I am stubborn, but would like to see...

72
00:08:36.726 --> 00:08:43.024
- To save our daughter. Where is;
- More is at stake here.


73
00:08:43.107 --> 00:08:47.779
Corrections could not be the
end of humanity on Mars.

74
00:08:47.862 --> 00:08:53.034
- Who is she; Area police?
- The Commander Alison Reiger.


75
00:08:53.117 --> 00:08:57.330
Wait a second! 
You have weapons on Mars?

76
00:08:57.413 --> 00:09:01.793
- Safety is always necessary.
- We can talk;


77
00:09:01.876 --> 00:09:08.424
- I told unfit for life.
- Less for each day, thanks to you.


78
00:09:08.508 --> 00:09:13.971
When using my technology
for the wrong reasons. Perfect.

79
00:09:15.098 --> 00:09:21.270
- What do you mean;
- He's bitter, and stubborn bastard.


80
00:09:22.438 --> 00:09:28.402
But has the advanced technology. 
It is probably here to help.

81
00:09:28.486 --> 00:09:31.614
Shit about what happens
here in the long run.

82
00:09:31.697 --> 00:09:37.995
It is a distraction that I have cleared
the ground and everyone comes home.


83
00:09:38.079 --> 00:09:44.627
- Foster...
- I'm here for a reason. To see my daughter. Where is Ellie?


84
00:10:00.101 --> 00:10:06.399
- We have to take when you have a plan.
- A plan; In waited for rescue.


85
00:10:06.482 --> 00:10:13.239
- Klaus will be no rescue.
- Said in three days and we went to the
tunnel. She said in three days, not me.


86
00:10:13.322 --> 00:10:20.747
There is a broken field generator.
The storm was disturbed by the dome area.


87
00:10:21.956 --> 00:10:26.252
- We have to go now.
- The satellite is probably blocked.


88
00:10:26.335 --> 00:10:30.840
And will soon be out. 
What do we have to do;

89
00:10:30.923 --> 00:10:35.470
The sandstorm block the satellite
signal on the way to the MLA.


90
00:10:35.553 --> 00:10:40.558
Not hear enough in advance to leave.
We have to take care of ourselves.


91
00:10:43.644 --> 00:10:47.064
We can try to take
us to the MLA tunnel.

92
00:10:47.148 --> 00:10:51.611
Or take the clothing to the control tower.

93
00:10:51.694 --> 00:10:58.618
- On the roof, we might ftasoue the MLA.
- Yes, but there are only two uniforms.


94
00:10:58.701 --> 00:11:03.331
You said you would wait for rescue.

95
00:11:03.414 --> 00:11:07.585
Nobody leaves before we know
what is wrong with the dome.

96
00:11:07.668 --> 00:11:13.132
If we go out and this is dangerous,
then go here to wait for rescue.


97
00:11:13.216 --> 00:11:16.302
Okay, the worst of the storm
is now in New York Mars.

98
00:11:16.385 --> 00:11:22.767
According to the telemetry strikes
the eye of MLA hours.

99
00:11:22.850 --> 00:11:27.396
After that the worst is
over, but not out of danger.

100
00:11:27.480 --> 00:11:32.235
The storm hit the
waves while moving toward us.

101
00:11:32.318 --> 00:11:36.614
It is not like the usual storms.

102
00:11:36.697 --> 00:11:43.663
Founded on Olympus Mons.
killing five in my group.

103
00:11:43.746 --> 00:11:49.502
- There is an outbreak?
- The heating has awakened volcano.


104
00:11:49.585 --> 00:11:55.758
- A volcanic sand storm.
- In the planets do not like when
you increase the temperature.


105
00:11:55.842 --> 00:12:00.555
The storm is a
symptom, just as the Yellowstone.

106
00:12:00.638 --> 00:12:06.686
- No, it was a natural disaster.
- Climate change does not mean anything?


107
00:12:06.769 --> 00:12:11.482
We are not here to discuss what happened
on Earth. It has already become Dr. Foster,


108
00:12:11.566 --> 00:12:14.694
and, if I remember, you lost.

109
00:12:14.777 --> 00:12:18.531
We have lost a significant number
of resources to bring them here.


110
00:12:18.614 --> 00:12:23.703
Show that Dr. Weller has the
right to help us stop the storm.

111
00:12:23.786 --> 00:12:29.959
I said that this would happen.
This was a mistake to come here.


112
00:12:30.042 --> 00:12:33.796
Being here is a waste of resources.

113
00:12:33.880 --> 00:12:40.595
I got all the brightest minds on
the planet except one. My own.


114
00:12:40.678 --> 00:12:45.224
My storm distraction only
from my work on Earth.

115
00:12:45.308 --> 00:12:49.353
Luckily, perhaps I can stop.

116
00:12:49.437 --> 00:12:55.234
- How can we stop it, Dr. Foster?
- A series of transmitters EMF


117
00:12:55.318 --> 00:13:00.072
We can build on the Earth. To beat
the volcanic ash from the air.


118
00:13:00.156 --> 00:13:07.205
To create an active site with a low
frequency electromagnetic field.


119
00:13:07.288 --> 00:13:12.168
And a drive device uses this field,

120
00:13:12.251 --> 00:13:19.133
as transmission means and sends a pulse of charged
particles will counteract the action of the storm,


121
00:13:19.217 --> 00:13:22.429
and goodbye. So I had to
go to New York on Mars before.

122
00:13:22.513 --> 00:13:27.809
We can use the data measured by the cuff
for the calibration of the unit load.


123
00:13:27.892 --> 00:13:34.065
You just have to determine who put the
transmitters. Now, we must put an MLA in here.


124
00:13:34.148 --> 00:13:40.321
A New York Mars. It should be high. On the
roof of the tallest building, right?


125
00:13:40.404 --> 00:13:47.036
And then... what is it here?

126
00:13:47.120 --> 00:13:52.959
It's a relay station. 
There is a radiofonikos tower here.

127
00:13:53.042 --> 00:13:56.587
Perfect. This is the
position of the third transmitter.

128
00:13:56.671 --> 00:14:00.842
Good. We can try to
flush out the communication signal,

129
00:14:00.925 --> 00:14:08.474
while we we there. Finally, the motion
device. We must let the eye of the storm.


130
00:14:08.558 --> 00:14:13.813
Once you cross this line...

131
00:14:13.896 --> 00:14:18.484
If you go too early,
the storm can be restored.

132
00:14:18.568 --> 00:14:23.823
If you release too late, we all die.

133
00:14:29.203 --> 00:14:32.331
It is very dangerous
to fly in the storm,

134
00:14:32.415 --> 00:14:38.921
after Andrew Foster will take a security team
in New York Mars o Neil, you have to deliver,


135
00:14:39.005 --> 00:14:44.343
and install the second transmitter. And from
there go in storm activate the detonator.


136
00:14:44.427 --> 00:14:51.184
The Reiger and I will install the third
transmitter on the roof and then wait for the
eye of the storm to pass the area of effect.


137
00:14:51.267 --> 00:14:58.524
This keeps an expert on each transmitter.
I will prepare take off once they're ready.


138
00:14:58.608 --> 00:15:03.404
For all these reasons, we must hope
that will work. Let's do it.


139
00:15:05.406 --> 00:15:11.329
- How can we help Ellie?
- Upon cessation of the storm.


140
00:15:11.412 --> 00:15:17.460
When clean, I get a bus and
are received in New York of Mars.

141
00:15:17.543 --> 00:15:21.714
I will not go back
to Earth before it is safe.

142
00:15:21.798 --> 00:15:26.135
There you have it christened yet? The storm.

143
00:15:26.219 --> 00:15:28.763
I suggest the name Mars.

144
00:15:28.846 --> 00:15:35.394
He who descended from Olympus to destroy. The god
of war. I thought you liked the Greek mythology.


145
00:15:35.478 --> 00:15:42.610
Should people be at war on their
planet? It is the wrong message.


146
00:15:42.693 --> 00:15:46.697
This is exactly the right message.

147
00:15:46.781 --> 00:15:53.871
You know. When you see that only
gives a sense called. Jupiter.


148
00:16:05.179 --> 00:16:08.928
Why are we not prepared for this?
To make our own storm thinner?


149
00:16:09.011 --> 00:16:13.850
This was invented only after I left home.

150
00:16:13.933 --> 00:16:18.938
We went more to try to build one that got
to fetch Dr. Foster. You got it, Reiger?


151
00:16:19.021 --> 00:16:23.276
We can not do without him.

152
00:16:28.823 --> 00:16:34.162
The law also. The majority of children are people. The girls
are distinguished as people posted in the last book?


153
00:16:34.245 --> 00:16:37.415
How can we overcome it?

154
00:16:37.498 --> 00:16:42.879
Foster will tell Ellie I'm in the dark,
I'll be careful to see, okay? Of course!


155
00:16:42.962 --> 00:16:49.594
- Remember that the transmitters operate?
- Do not worry about me! We talk a lot about the
ship. Concentrate on obtaining data and find Ellie!


156
00:16:49.677 --> 00:16:56.434
- The storm entered the tunnel. Are you here;
- It can not be so strong!


157
00:16:56.517 --> 00:16:59.896
Oh my God!

158
00:17:05.985 --> 00:17:11.616
- Transmitters ETL. Quickly!
- Who is Ellie!


159
00:17:14.494 --> 00:17:19.957
- We have to close the tunnel. Now!
- Quickly!


160
00:17:22.168 --> 00:17:24.837
Put zones.

161
00:17:27.924 --> 00:17:32.887
Andrea, Close it, now!

162
00:17:35.681 --> 00:17:38.726
What was he doing?

163
00:17:53.741 --> 00:17:57.620
Final.

164
00:18:03.167 --> 00:18:08.131
MLA tunnel number 66. 
It is to walk.

165
00:18:08.214 --> 00:18:13.719
- Okay, ladies. We can leave.
- Klaus...


166
00:18:15.096 --> 00:18:18.516
What are you waiting for; Let's go.

167
00:18:24.230 --> 00:18:28.776
Ida... I have a plan. 
I will leave her.

168
00:18:28.860 --> 00:18:33.197
- I missing out three. Three...
- No! Believe me!


169
00:18:33.281 --> 00:18:36.939
3 2 No 1 Ellie!

170
00:18:50.047 --> 00:18:55.762
You climbed into a metal box with your new wife and
the former, and were directed to a monster storm?


171
00:18:55.845 --> 00:18:59.974
- Yes of course. If that helps.
- What is happening here;


172
00:19:00.057 --> 00:19:04.103
We talk... How many people will have to
die to stop underestimate this storm?


173
00:19:04.187 --> 00:19:08.775
The emergency is issued, all put in
shelters and wait to get this thing.


174
00:19:08.858 --> 00:19:13.446
Ordinary dust storms on Mars can last for weeks
on end. How long can be in your shelter?


175
00:19:13.529 --> 00:19:18.284
- The very few days?
- Seven. Good luck with that. There are several.


176
00:19:18.367 --> 00:19:23.331
We close the lower dome
and transfer energy to shelters.

177
00:19:23.414 --> 00:19:29.712
- The fuselage will definitely
switched off when the storm comes.
- There is a choice Reiger. We have to kill before.


178
00:19:31.047 --> 00:19:35.218
And we know to be successful? 
Why is it said?

179
00:19:35.301 --> 00:19:41.682
Who would bet the lives of all who
are in the MLA? It will not happen!


180
00:19:41.766 --> 00:19:47.438
Send our two best people to die if you
like, but when you fail this mission,


181
00:19:47.522 --> 00:19:52.235
We'll do things my way. Until
then I put people into shelters.


182
00:19:52.318 --> 00:19:57.573
I have three days in which to do it.
After that I will not hear it anymore.


183
00:20:00.993 --> 00:20:04.789
She is fun.

184
00:20:16.968 --> 00:20:21.639
We can not stay here. 
It may take weeks before they come.

185
00:20:21.722 --> 00:20:26.936
What do we have to do; The tunnel has been destroyed
and the dome is affected by the pressure drop.


186
00:20:27.019 --> 00:20:29.313
What do we have to do;

187
00:20:31.732 --> 00:20:39.037
We are ready. The battery is charged and solar
cells help us. Let us follow the storm,


188
00:20:39.073 --> 00:20:45.329
any changes speed or direction will do our best
to let you know, but the coverage is poor.


189
00:20:45.413 --> 00:20:50.835
Be careful and be fast. 
Ellie had a radio a few days ago.

190
00:20:50.918 --> 00:20:56.466
- I believe that just passed the wave,
it takes another external signal.
- And then we can look for, right?


191
00:20:56.549 --> 00:21:02.972
Foster. It is important to save Ellie,
but will save stopping the storm.


192
00:21:03.055 --> 00:21:07.435
The Rover is barely
equipped for two return trips.

193
00:21:07.518 --> 00:21:12.231
- You can not get others.
- No. No. I do not care.


194
00:21:12.315 --> 00:21:18.571
You can take my place. To know
since I was 5 years old, Foster.


195
00:21:18.654 --> 00:21:21.824
I love and Ellie too. 
If there is a way, we'll find him,

196
00:21:21.908 --> 00:21:27.455
but if Jupiter is dead, you're the
most important person on Mars.


197
00:21:27.538 --> 00:21:33.086
- After you, doctor. We'll go into this thing?
- Yes.


198
00:21:33.169 --> 00:21:38.800
- It is even smaller than the terrestrial vehicle.
- Let's go.


199
00:22:04.325 --> 00:22:08.884
These farms are united.

200
00:22:10.373 --> 00:22:14.924
If you were not the bombs of
hydrocarbons, none of them could.


201
00:22:16.337 --> 00:22:20.508
Yes, I created this hell. Thank you, Neil.

202
00:22:20.591 --> 00:22:25.346
- I thought you knew about Miranda.
- For sure.


203
00:22:25.430 --> 00:22:30.768
Therefore you have forgotten to mention
the name of for how many months?


204
00:22:30.852 --> 00:22:36.107
- I need to know if I can trust you, Neil.
- You know what, Pete... Dr. Foster.


205
00:22:36.190 --> 00:22:40.987
If interested so much, 
I hate to talk, man. 
You need to know.

206
00:22:41.070 --> 00:22:48.286
And speaking of trust, you can trust me? I was
not removed from all this, from Miranda, Ellie.


207
00:22:48.369 --> 00:22:53.207
By mankind. You can not do that and
then get upset when people move.


208
00:22:53.291 --> 00:22:58.588
Do not worry about me, but for
all people in the MLA and on Mars.


209
00:22:58.671 --> 00:23:04.093
Think about it. 
Is human survival stake.

210
00:23:04.177 --> 00:23:07.172
It is the mission, Dr. Foster.

211
00:23:09.098 --> 00:23:15.229
Can you trust me? 
The question is can we trust?

212
00:23:15.313 --> 00:23:22.320
All I did was try to save the Earth. We went from Earth
when almost collapsed when the Yellowstone broke.


213
00:23:22.403 --> 00:23:27.784
Yes, and you left on a planet-sized volcano Arizona.
An inert volcano. In which you woke up.


214
00:23:27.867 --> 00:23:32.330
- With your technology.
- The stole.
- I built this technology to help the Earth.


215
00:23:32.413 --> 00:23:36.751
The rest of us vevaiothikame that
the future of man was on Mars.


216
00:23:36.834 --> 00:23:42.715
- Ellie was five. Could I choose?
- This is between you and Miranda.


217
00:23:42.799 --> 00:23:49.138
Ellie is here. This is key. He seems to be
concerned more with the decision you did.


218
00:23:49.222 --> 00:23:52.725
What it supposed to mean?

219
00:23:53.976 --> 00:24:00.024
To know for a long time, Foster. 
That means a lot to me.

220
00:24:00.108 --> 00:24:05.780
But throughout her life, she thought
she just loved the planet.


221
00:24:07.782 --> 00:24:13.913
I stayed behind on Earth to
clean it, so she can come home.

222
00:24:13.996 --> 00:24:17.835
And when you find it, it will be
exactly what you ask her to do.


223
00:24:28.094 --> 00:24:33.141
- Andrew.
- Director Weller. About tunnels...


224
00:24:33.224 --> 00:24:39.564
- You do not have to apologize.
- No apologies.
- We all want the good of the colony just following orders.


225
00:24:39.647 --> 00:24:46.112
I was right. If I had not closed
the doors, it would be much worse.


226
00:24:46.195 --> 00:24:53.244
We are friends. I care about you, and I
hope Ellie is okay. I think Ellie is fine.


227
00:24:53.327 --> 00:24:58.791
But Reiger was right. 
Even though Ellie was there,

228
00:24:58.875 --> 00:25:04.964
I would have done the same thing.
There'd hazard colony for anyone.


229
00:25:07.133 --> 00:25:10.178
Understandable.

230
00:25:16.684 --> 00:25:20.732
Oh, baby. How dry... how dry.

231
00:25:22.815 --> 00:25:25.402
So beautiful! So beautiful!

232
00:25:29.739 --> 00:25:34.494
Damn. What are we doing now;

233
00:25:59.018 --> 00:26:03.723
- Oh. Ooh. What are you doing;
- Do not stay here, we?


234
00:26:04.107 --> 00:26:08.320
- We have a mission.
- We can not get closer?


235
00:26:09.403 --> 00:26:13.741
- Maybe even the security camera?
- I do not think so, Doctor.


236
00:26:13.825 --> 00:26:19.872
- You knew it had to come out of this thing.
- I was hoping to avoid as much as possible.


237
00:26:19.956 --> 00:26:22.715
Well, There is no better time.

238
00:26:30.425 --> 00:26:34.095
Beautiful, is not it?

239
00:26:34.178 --> 00:26:37.974
I would like to come in now, please.

240
00:26:38.057 --> 00:26:41.185
Come on.

241
00:26:43.229 --> 00:26:46.191
I do not know why you
did not want to leave the Earth.

242
00:26:47.275 --> 00:26:51.910
- Fewer words, more air pockets.
- You can go, Doctor.


243
00:27:06.878 --> 00:27:11.091
- First time;
- Is there a cigarette?


244
00:27:12.175 --> 00:27:16.971
- You have my parts?
- Which parts?


245
00:27:23.186 --> 00:27:28.191
I want to help, but the
suit broke, and I have no spare.

246
00:27:28.274 --> 00:27:33.571
- I can not go away, not for long.
- You know the way and know the tools.


247
00:27:33.654 --> 00:27:38.242
- I'd rather have that Dr. Foster.
- No offense, Doctor.
- I hate to offend.


248
00:27:38.326 --> 00:27:44.957
You probably borrow the outfit
Foster doctor and join me?

249
00:27:45.041 --> 00:27:50.597
Help both Dr. Pete Johnson
and the famous Neal Weller,

250
00:27:50.880 --> 00:27:55.259
a project of global importance?
- That is right.
- You're right.


251
00:27:56.511 --> 00:28:01.390
Okay. Tomorrow morning. Extremely.

252
00:28:01.474 --> 00:28:08.022
Sorry if I was unclear. quite clear. It should
be done now. There is no time to waste.


253
00:28:08.106 --> 00:28:13.402
- It is dangerous at night.
- I know we can not expect much.


254
00:28:13.486 --> 00:28:16.239
You are welcome.

255
00:28:20.326 --> 00:28:25.832
- I think I could get used to walk more.
- Doctor, with her outfit.


256
00:28:34.507 --> 00:28:38.302
Thank you.

257
00:28:38.386 --> 00:28:40.993
- Where were you;
- Control the evacuation.


258
00:28:41.279 --> 00:28:47.462
Do not worry about evacuations. It's under
control. Neil Foster and this problem is.


259
00:28:47.895 --> 00:28:52.442
- The storm is moving towards them.
- I take communication.


260
00:28:52.525 --> 00:28:56.112
Maybe we can not hear anything from them.

261
00:28:56.195 --> 00:29:01.451
- Do not worry. Will restore communication.
- I hope so.


262
00:29:06.038 --> 00:29:12.336
- All good down there, Doctor?
- Everything is wonderful.


263
00:29:12.420 --> 00:29:18.815
Ouliana, enjoy your drink Martian. Thank you.

264
00:29:19.552 --> 00:29:25.650
- It could not have happened without my job.
- Just do not drink it all.


265
00:29:27.059 --> 00:29:30.772
We should be there.

266
00:29:30.855 --> 00:29:34.942
Right up to the top.

267
00:29:39.655 --> 00:29:45.161
- You are there; Do you hear me;
- Okay.


268
00:29:45.244 --> 00:29:49.499
- Please, Foster, answer.
- Miranda?


269
00:30:00.802 --> 00:30:06.724
- Do you think Miranda trying to communicate with us.
- The signal is improved in a few minutes.


270
00:30:06.808 --> 00:30:11.056
- Did you hear what he says?
- Miranda? Not yet.


271
00:30:15.650 --> 00:30:20.692
- What now?
- Miranda, you hear me?


272
00:30:33.376 --> 00:30:39.715
- Neil, come back.
- We have almost finished. Doctor.


273
00:30:39.799 --> 00:30:43.970
Neil, look to the west!

274
00:30:44.053 --> 00:30:47.081
Foster, put the outfit Oulianas.

275
00:30:49.100 --> 00:30:53.050
- I thought it was broken.
- Just do it. Foster.


276
00:30:53.771 --> 00:30:58.151
You must insert the Rover and drive
it to the foot of the cliff.


277
00:30:58.234 --> 00:31:03.531
- The outfit will not keep it safe for a long time.
- Just need only to enter the Rover.


278
00:31:03.614 --> 00:31:08.745
Foster, you do. 
It is a short walk away.

279
00:31:12.790 --> 00:31:16.961
- Oxygen level 100 percent.
- What does this mean;


280
00:31:17.044 --> 00:31:22.175
- That there is full oxygen.
- Good. Thank you.


281
00:31:22.258 --> 00:31:27.221
This is liar. The uniform false. 
It is a problem.

282
00:31:27.305 --> 00:31:33.728
- How long do I have?
- Put your suit and go to the rover now.


283
00:31:33.811 --> 00:31:35.510
Run, Foster!

284
00:31:48.134 --> 00:31:52.013
Oh my God!

285
00:31:52.205 --> 00:31:58.086
Ouliana! Wait! Hold on! 
I'll pull through!

286
00:31:58.169 --> 00:32:01.297
Hold steady!

287
00:32:11.265 --> 00:32:14.894
Ouliana!

288
00:32:32.036 --> 00:32:37.333
- How is the Rover, Doctor?
- I'm working on it.


289
00:32:47.385 --> 00:32:53.057
- The antenna is gone, Neil.
- Just bring the Rover into position.


290
00:33:02.303 --> 00:33:03.453
Quiet, Doctor!

291
00:33:07.660 --> 00:33:08.810
Move on, Doctor.

292
00:33:19.344 --> 00:33:22.078
- Where is the Ouliana?
- One problem at a time.


293
00:33:42.023 --> 00:33:43.145
Ellie?

294
00:33:45.985 --> 00:33:47.424
I do not understand.

295
00:33:48.861 --> 00:33:53.680
Hello; Neil, Foster? Answer.

296
00:33:54.938 --> 00:33:56.268
Please answer now.

297
00:33:59.207 --> 00:34:01.481
- Exchange?
- Ellie?


298
00:34:02.251 --> 00:34:03.998
Alt? Is there anyone there?

299
00:34:05.671 --> 00:34:10.843
We can now see the repeater. Have
you heard from Neil or Foster?


300
00:34:10.927 --> 00:34:15.598
Not yet, but they have returned to the
long communication has progressed.


301
00:34:15.681 --> 00:34:21.104
I have to believe? 
The storm just passed the company's site.

302
00:34:21.187 --> 00:34:26.609
They still have two days to perform this
task. And completed the first objective.


303
00:34:26.692 --> 00:34:32.407
So we're on schedule. 
Yes this is why it works. believe me.

304
00:34:32.490 --> 00:34:38.538
The last time I trusted, many died.
How many people were evacuated?


305
00:34:38.621 --> 00:34:43.292
I did not know that was in
our way if we were not there.

306
00:34:43.376 --> 00:34:47.964
To come into contact with them, Weller. 
To refer to me.

307
00:34:49.340 --> 00:34:55.763
- Ellie? Can you hear me;
- Mother?


308
00:34:55.847 --> 00:35:00.435
- Thank you, Thank God. Are you safe?
- Yes.


309
00:35:00.518 --> 00:35:05.398
- We are in the warehouse. What happens;
- Who are you in the warehouse?


310
00:35:05.481 --> 00:35:09.444
- With the Ida.
- Hey, Director Weller.


311
00:35:09.527 --> 00:35:15.783
You should go to the tunnel. With
the storm the pressure dropped.


312
00:35:15.867 --> 00:35:22.457
We know. The tunnels are not working. We do
not know what went wrong in your head.


313
00:35:22.540 --> 00:35:28.504
- Mom, maybe get us some?
- Your father and Neil are on the road.
- Did you see Dad and Neil?


314
00:35:28.508 --> 00:35:33.509
That's why Neil left,
to get this monster away?

315
00:35:33.513 --> 00:35:38.389
No time for that. We need your help.
They are off course and have little time.


316
00:35:38.473 --> 00:35:43.978
- There are uniforms to the shelter there?
- Yes, both.


317
00:35:44.061 --> 00:35:50.651
Okay, I want to put them. Honey, I know you have been
through a lot, but you have to ask to spend a little more.


318
00:35:50.735 --> 00:35:56.074
The storm will hit you in waves. You have
a window now, but it will not last long.


319
00:35:56.157 --> 00:36:02.705
You must return the tunnels and get there. In New
York ordered Mars before Neil and Foster get there.


320
00:36:02.789 --> 00:36:09.545
I ask only risking a lot based on the word.
And that was not worth much when we left Earth.


321
00:36:09.629 --> 00:36:15.218
- It's all we have. I believe in him.
- I hope you're right.


322
00:36:15.301 --> 00:36:21.933
They come, but we do not know when. I want to go to
the Control Center and access the compass controls.


323
00:36:22.016 --> 00:36:26.229
Download an error report. 
The Foster to do.

324
00:36:26.312 --> 00:36:29.982
Be ready when they land.

325
00:36:30.066 --> 00:36:34.613
- Ida.
- Yes ma'am;
- Please call me Miranda.
- Yes ma'am;


326
00:36:35.196 --> 00:36:40.410
- To keep my daughter safe.
- I promise.


327
00:36:40.493 --> 00:36:45.581
Try to stay in touch. skip Center. 
They come there.

328
00:36:45.665 --> 00:36:49.585
Simply will be delayed a bit.

329
00:36:54.674 --> 00:36:59.637
- Make sure it is well tied, Doc.
- Sure, it ready.


330
00:36:59.720 --> 00:37:05.810
- Get up here and tighten your belt.
- I hate when you say that.


331
00:37:16.028 --> 00:37:21.284
We arrive there. I know. The Rover
will not survive the storm. I know.


332
00:37:21.367 --> 00:37:27.123
- What are you doing;
- You said it yourself, Doctor.
There will survive this storm.


333
00:37:28.875 --> 00:37:34.630
- It's a rock, Neil!
- We need to move, we get a new road.


334
00:37:37.884 --> 00:37:43.598
- The moat protects us from the storm.
- And the sun.


335
00:37:43.681 --> 00:37:46.642
One problem the moment, hold on!

336
00:37:57.028 --> 00:38:01.240
- What are we doing now;
- You just have to land.


337
00:38:05.369 --> 00:38:08.790
This is your plan?

338
00:38:21.641 --> 00:38:25.379
One size fits all. For sure.

339
00:38:25.890 --> 00:38:30.937
- I did not like them after school.
- Can you help me here?


340
00:38:33.022 --> 00:38:37.985
In warehouses, we take a
series of additional air reservoirs.

341
00:38:38.069 --> 00:38:42.824
There is a strap
at the back. Back there.

342
00:38:42.907 --> 00:38:47.161
- I can see that.
- You; This is nice.


343
00:38:51.958 --> 00:38:55.670
Like this.

344
00:38:58.214 --> 00:39:03.761
Your mother... 
She said nothing to rescue.

345
00:39:03.845 --> 00:39:10.017
If a mother called her father
and her dad came to reality,

346
00:39:10.101 --> 00:39:16.065
the storm is bigger than we thought.
- So think and our dead?


347
00:39:17.150 --> 00:39:21.988
It may seem pretty bleak
if my father is involved.

348
00:39:23.448 --> 00:39:28.953
For 20 years, the father pulled radioactive
ash from the Earth's atmosphere.


349
00:39:29.036 --> 00:39:35.251
That's all he cared. The fact that
makes him come here is important.


350
00:39:38.129 --> 00:39:41.257
Hey, listen, Ida...

351
00:39:41.340 --> 00:39:47.346
I tell you that you need not participate.
You can not expect the storm here.


352
00:39:50.016 --> 00:39:54.395
I will not leave you.

353
00:39:54.479 --> 00:40:00.193
I promised to your mother to
keep you safe, and I meant it.

354
00:40:00.276 --> 00:40:03.196
Okay;

355
00:40:08.076 --> 00:40:12.246
I hope your dad to
be there when they come.

356
00:40:12.330 --> 00:40:18.419
The Neil was the first trip here
from Earth and the first back.


357
00:40:18.503 --> 00:40:24.133
He has been on
Mars more than any other.

358
00:40:24.217 --> 00:40:28.721
If anyone can bring
them here, is Neil Weller.

359
00:40:37.271 --> 00:40:43.236
- Eve, check the vital signs Dr. Foster, please?
- The pulse and breathing are normal.


360
00:40:45.238 --> 00:40:52.078
- How long have the life support?
- In current energy levels, 2.5 hours.


361
00:40:52.161 --> 00:40:58.084
- How much oxygen we?
- For 12 hours. To anyone;


362
00:40:59.585 --> 00:41:06.342
- How much oxygen for two people?
- A total of 12 six hours in each.


363
00:41:06.426 --> 00:41:12.849
- I've experienced worse, Eva.
- The command is not recognized.


364
00:41:12.932 --> 00:41:17.687
Time to wake up, Doc. Wake up.

365
00:41:20.231 --> 00:41:23.985
Okay, what's the plan?

366
00:41:24.068 --> 00:41:27.822
I do not think we will succeed.

367
00:41:27.905 --> 00:41:32.618
- What are you talking about;
- I drove the Rover too hard yesterday.


368
00:41:32.702 --> 00:41:37.957
We have approximately 2 hours of power.

369
00:41:38.040 --> 00:41:43.087
We're stuck here until you come
out the storm, so we can leave.


370
00:41:43.171 --> 00:41:49.552
So I expect to
pass this wave. So what;

371
00:41:49.635 --> 00:41:54.891
- We are stuck in a ravine.
- There is a more up output.


372
00:41:54.974 --> 00:41:59.395
The hill going back
to New York to Mars.

373
00:42:00.605 --> 00:42:05.318
- This is nice;
- In two hours.


374
00:42:05.401 --> 00:42:10.823
Including support life. 
We must take our uniforms back.

375
00:42:15.161 --> 00:42:18.664
- And my outfit is not working.
- What does not work.


376
00:42:21.459 --> 00:42:27.548
Come on, Neil. perhaps you were the
smartest in the world before I came.


377
00:42:28.925 --> 00:42:33.679
- What do you think;
- Thank you.


378
00:42:34.889 --> 00:42:38.643
I do not think I
could imagine us out of it.

379
00:42:42.897 --> 00:42:47.193
It was such a discussion
that brought us into this mess.

380
00:42:47.276 --> 00:42:52.490
By this I mean that chaos two million miles
from Earth, stuck deep into a ravine.


381
00:42:52.573 --> 00:42:59.163
A huge, electric sandstorm rages
and kill all our loved ones.

382
00:43:02.708 --> 00:43:08.214
There then resigned and will not resign now.

383
00:43:09.966 --> 00:43:13.136
Foster?

384
00:43:13.219 --> 00:43:16.889
What do you think;

385
00:43:44.083 --> 00:43:49.589
Mother told me to take the elevator through
the service tunnel. Okay. Let's go.


386
00:44:00.016 --> 00:44:05.438
We need to get down to the station to get to
the elevator. What; Down there? Are you afraid?


387
00:44:05.442 --> 00:44:08.628
- No.
- Okay. Let's go.


388
00:45:21.722 --> 00:45:26.477
He get halfway. 
We have to walk the rest.

389
00:45:55.590 --> 00:46:00.553
- Going through the tunnel of New York on Mars?
- Yes, probably.


390
00:46:00.636 --> 00:46:06.309
- But what if I choose the wrong road.
- Your mom can spot the location.


391
00:46:06.392 --> 00:46:11.606
But what if they are wrong. 
We can handle it.

392
00:46:11.689 --> 00:46:16.611
- Mom, we're almost there.
- Approaching the control center.


393
00:46:16.694 --> 00:46:20.907
I got it.

394
00:46:20.990 --> 00:46:27.830
Hey, listen. Go to the Control Center of New
York of Mars, if you will, should be safer.


395
00:46:28.956 --> 00:46:34.629
It is the ankle. 
He broke when we ran to find shelter.

396
00:46:34.712 --> 00:46:40.218
We need to get out of the tunnel before
the pressure drops. Can you do it?


397
00:46:40.301 --> 00:46:45.014
Yes I can. Then go.

398
00:46:50.186 --> 00:46:55.566
- Okay. No problem to the control center.
- Okay. Sounds simple.


399
00:46:55.650 --> 00:47:00.279
- We'll be there soon.
- Oh, my God, watch out.


400
00:47:07.286 --> 00:47:13.876
- Hello.
- Carl and Dana, Ellie Weller.


401
00:47:13.960 --> 00:47:18.631
Ellie Weller? Hell what to do down here?

402
00:47:21.843 --> 00:47:27.223
Foster, you have to ask again. 
Are you sure it works?

403
00:47:27.306 --> 00:47:32.979
- I do not want to destroy the launcher.
- continue to work.


404
00:47:33.062 --> 00:47:37.233
When using it as
a lightning rod was damaged.

405
00:47:37.316 --> 00:47:42.010
- One of us have to activate it manually.
- We agree with that?


406
00:47:44.449 --> 00:47:48.870
We have to be. 
One problem at a time.

407
00:47:48.873 --> 00:47:53.082
Okay. What should I do.

408
00:47:59.881 --> 00:48:05.928
Are you sure; When we begin, we
need to move it is. We are ready.


409
00:48:06.012 --> 00:48:11.017
Yes I am sure. 
What is the difference between the slope?

410
00:48:11.100 --> 00:48:16.481
Not much, but the rise consumes much power.

411
00:48:16.564 --> 00:48:21.444
We have to go close
to Jupiter and steal some lightning.

412
00:48:21.527 --> 00:48:26.574
One can take us
to New York to Mars.

413
00:48:26.657 --> 00:48:32.121
Yes, I hope you're right.

414
00:48:32.205 --> 00:48:35.666
Then we are both.

415
00:48:35.750 --> 00:48:42.006
I'll say it again: You
have to have my outfit.

416
00:48:42.090 --> 00:48:47.178
If this does not
work, we will die both.

417
00:48:47.261 --> 00:48:49.680
Okay.

418
00:48:51.265 --> 00:48:56.562
- Close on life support.
- Oxygen level 100 percent.


419
00:49:09.200 --> 00:49:12.912
It will be very slow transport.

420
00:49:12.995 --> 00:49:18.751
- We must leave?
- No, of course not.


421
00:49:24.549 --> 00:49:27.885
We are almost at
the bottom of the storm,

422
00:49:27.969 --> 00:49:33.074
- But we are losing speed and power.
- How you doing;


423
00:49:33.307 --> 00:49:36.936
100% oxygen level.

424
00:49:37.019 --> 00:49:41.899
- Oxygen level 100 percent.
- Like I said.


425
00:49:49.782 --> 00:49:53.828
Okay, that's it.

426
00:49:53.911 --> 00:49:57.498
Now just have to wait.

427
00:50:02.253 --> 00:50:08.092
Mom, we'll be there
soon enough, but I recognize.

428
00:50:08.176 --> 00:50:11.012
Mother;

429
00:50:11.095 --> 00:50:15.029
The air for the MLA tunnel
on the way. Are you sure;

430
00:50:15.975 --> 00:50:19.919
- Ellie, hey.
- Yes, positive. We are security agents.


431
00:50:19.955 --> 00:50:26.069
- I worked in this industry.
- The storm is in the tunnel.


432
00:50:26.152 --> 00:50:28.946
It is very likely not to come here?

433
00:50:29.030 --> 00:50:34.535
- Ellie!
- Oh my god. We must have the speed up!


434
00:50:36.496 --> 00:50:43.503
Open air-locks! Run, I have her! Run!

435
00:50:50.760 --> 00:50:56.724
- I can not!
- Continue, I have her!


436
00:50:59.185 --> 00:51:01.230
Come on! Guys.

437
00:51:26.648 --> 00:51:28.734
Here, techi, techi, techi.

438
00:51:45.273 --> 00:51:47.192
Neil. Neil.

439
00:51:48.276 --> 00:51:53.823
Doctor? Foster? 
You can not breathe?

440
00:51:56.993 --> 00:52:01.622
Hold on, my friend! 
Here comes more oxygen.

441
00:52:02.999 --> 00:52:07.063
Let's go. Relax yourself! 
Here comes the delicious oxygen.

442
00:52:09.147 --> 00:52:14.302
It's good; Sit back. Foster, Look at me!

443
00:52:14.385 --> 00:52:20.349
There is air in the cabin. 
I take the helmet off. It's cold.

444
00:52:27.148 --> 00:52:32.570
- It's cold.
- It is OK. Now we wait.


445
00:52:39.160 --> 00:52:41.719
Here we go. Okay, hold on, my friend.

446
00:52:43.873 --> 00:52:45.458
The life support returns.

447
00:52:53.341 --> 00:52:54.842
Damn! Doctor, let's go!

448
00:52:58.846 --> 00:53:04.018
Wait, Doctor! You should not resign, Foster!

449
00:53:05.603 --> 00:53:11.401
Eva, let his glove defibrillator.
Wait, Doc. I am coming.

450
00:53:15.446 --> 00:53:20.993
- Charge, Eva.
- Charge.


451
00:53:21.077 --> 00:53:26.707
- Charge again, Eva.
- Charge.


452
00:53:39.137 --> 00:53:42.890
Who moved here.

453
00:53:44.392 --> 00:53:50.273
- Eva, close the glove.
- Turn off the flow.


454
00:54:39.030 --> 00:54:42.617
Damn!

455
00:54:49.749 --> 00:54:53.836
Okay...

456
00:54:53.920 --> 00:55:00.551
I do not understand. Should be the New York
of Mars the safest place. How it happened?


457
00:55:00.635 --> 00:55:05.932
This was probably because the
pressure in the dome fell.

458
00:55:06.015 --> 00:55:09.977
Nobody knew that this would happen.

459
00:55:13.356 --> 00:55:18.111
Ellie... How can we stop this?

460
00:55:20.321 --> 00:55:25.243
We start by giving my father the information.

461
00:55:25.326 --> 00:55:28.871
After this.

462
00:55:30.164 --> 00:55:34.669
We do what we can.

463
00:55:34.752 --> 00:55:39.632
You see something on camera?

464
00:55:39.715 --> 00:55:42.427
Not yet.

465
00:55:42.510 --> 00:55:46.097
Will.

466
00:55:49.767 --> 00:55:54.147
- Maybe you should get some sleep.
- What's up with you;


467
00:55:54.230 --> 00:55:59.110
- I can handle it.
- I want to help.


468
00:55:59.193 --> 00:56:03.072
Helping you, Ida.

469
00:56:08.619 --> 00:56:12.790
I took almost all night, but
I have all the data ready.

470
00:56:12.874 --> 00:56:18.838
- Sweetness should be there.
- They are coming. Wait. Wait a minute.


471
00:56:18.921 --> 00:56:23.134
- Something to mention?
- Not yet.


472
00:56:23.217 --> 00:56:28.514
Miranda! It's now or never. Jupiter
comes today. Exhausted will do?


473
00:56:28.598 --> 00:56:31.768
Will.

474
00:56:32.935 --> 00:56:39.525
- Miranda, by virtue of what you speak?
- Now with Ellie.


475
00:56:39.609 --> 00:56:45.406
- You have to leave the room.
- Has information from the dome. Not a bad time.


476
00:56:45.490 --> 00:56:52.789
- That's not good enough.
- Can be installed EMF transmitter. This
will give them enough time to reach Jupiter.


477
00:56:52.872 --> 00:56:58.628
- You can your daughter to complete the mission?
- Yes. This can make it.


478
00:56:58.711 --> 00:57:02.173
Better than anyone else. 
Easy for you to say.

479
00:57:02.256 --> 00:57:09.263
Listen, Reiger. 
You do not see that it is the only solution. 
You can not hide under the earth!

480
00:57:09.347 --> 00:57:14.185
If you do not kill Zeus, 
Zeus kills us.

481
00:57:14.268 --> 00:57:18.981
Lambert accompanied the director
Weller the administration room.


482
00:57:19.065 --> 00:57:23.069
Are you kidding me; Do not do that.

483
00:57:23.152 --> 00:57:28.991
Now. Sorry Miranda. 
We tried your way. 
Time to say goodbye.

484
00:57:29.075 --> 00:57:31.244
Come on.

485
00:57:31.327 --> 00:57:36.165
Hello; Hello; Hello; Answer Miranda. Reiger. Each one.

486
00:57:36.249 --> 00:57:40.753
Foster! Miranda thank goodness. Foster,
where are you? What happened;


487
00:57:40.837 --> 00:57:45.716
Last night we were at Valles Marineris
moat. Not my favorite geological place.


488
00:57:45.800 --> 00:57:50.513
- Foster! Shut up!
- The point is that we are here.


489
00:57:53.224 --> 00:57:57.812
The southeastern air duct goes
directly to the control center.


490
00:57:57.895 --> 00:58:02.984
- Guys, Ellie is there. It has information from the dome.
- This is my girl.


491
00:58:03.067 --> 00:58:08.531
Give her the transmitter EMF and drive towards you
the storm. Foster is situated at the triangle.


492
00:58:08.614 --> 00:58:13.067
- In triangle of Foster?
- Just go there now. Hurry.
- Understandable.


493
00:58:31.471 --> 00:58:36.726
Everyone must see that there is hope
here. Oh, and do business with me.


494
00:58:36.809 --> 00:58:43.733
Alison secured first and close tunnels when necessary.

495
00:58:43.816 --> 00:58:48.279
- Sounds reasonable, captain.
- Do it.


496
00:58:48.362 --> 00:58:51.074
I just stay here.

497
00:58:55.161 --> 00:58:59.791
Ellie, you need to release the
southwest access to the airline.


498
00:58:59.874 --> 00:59:05.755
Wait, Mom. I have not seen him
for ages. What should I tell him?


499
00:59:05.838 --> 00:59:11.677
- I do not know what it is anymore.
- The same stubborn bastard as before.


500
00:59:11.761 --> 00:59:18.309
He can stop here. He knows what
he is doing, but needs our help.


501
00:59:18.393 --> 00:59:20.978
Okay.

502
00:59:24.774 --> 00:59:27.985
Hey.

503
00:59:32.490 --> 00:59:36.160
Let me see you.

504
00:59:45.795 --> 00:59:50.091
The mother said that the need is here.

505
00:59:50.174 --> 00:59:53.970
Yes I believe it. Thank you.

506
00:59:54.053 --> 00:59:58.808
- So you do this work?
- I should do it.


507
01:00:01.769 --> 01:00:08.025
Remember not to leave the Earth without you,
but I guess you said something similar.


508
01:00:11.487 --> 01:00:16.242
I did it right. 
I do it now as well.

509
01:00:22.081 --> 01:00:26.794
This is my friend. 
These are my fathers.

510
01:00:26.878 --> 01:00:30.089
Hello. Ida.

511
01:00:30.173 --> 01:00:34.761
Good to finally know that, Ida.

512
01:00:34.844 --> 01:00:38.431
- Doctor Pete Foster.
- Oh.


513
01:00:39.682 --> 01:00:43.436
Yes, it was quite difficult.

514
01:00:43.519 --> 01:00:47.690
- Mom said you need our help.
- Yes.


515
01:00:47.774 --> 01:00:52.320
Ellie. We need you to get this EMF transmitter
on the roof and the activations.


516
01:00:52.403 --> 01:00:56.157
Once enabled, turn back and protect yourself.

517
01:00:56.240 --> 01:00:59.077
What is the benefit from it?

518
01:00:59.160 --> 01:01:03.790
We have an actuator which uses the
field as a transmission medium


519
01:01:03.873 --> 01:01:07.710
Emits charged particles.

520
01:01:07.794 --> 01:01:11.881
So they should be in
the eye of the storm.

521
01:01:15.384 --> 01:01:18.888
Is that your plan?

522
01:01:18.971 --> 01:01:23.309
Ellie, I promise that we will return.

523
01:01:23.393 --> 01:01:27.897
- We can use one of the designs?
- That is the Ellie mothers plan.


524
01:01:27.980 --> 01:01:32.235
It works if you help us.

525
01:01:37.949 --> 01:01:40.076
Okay.

526
01:01:40.159 --> 01:01:46.499
I should probably point out that we do not
have so much oxygen. If you have to go again...


527
01:01:46.582 --> 01:01:53.005
We have reserves. We must go back, if we want
to achieve before the storm hit the MLA.


528
01:01:53.089 --> 01:01:58.719
Okay; Many people rely on
us in all of us.

529
01:01:58.803 --> 01:02:04.559
Sorry, but we have to cancel the reunion.

530
01:02:04.642 --> 01:02:07.814
- Come on let's go.
- Well, hey. Ellie...


531
01:02:11.107 --> 01:02:14.235
Before I leave...

532
01:02:16.529 --> 01:02:23.828
I do not know how
I can apologize for everything.

533
01:02:29.292 --> 01:02:35.047
To let you travel was
the hardest thing I've ever done.

534
01:02:36.758 --> 01:02:42.972
Hey, we have an almost completely clean place
on Earth. There no longer need face mask.


535
01:02:46.434 --> 01:02:51.481
It's wonderful. 
I would love there.

536
01:02:51.564 --> 01:02:57.403
And Ida... I do not
know if you were on Earth...

537
01:02:57.487 --> 01:03:02.116
But this can also be seen.

538
01:03:02.200 --> 01:03:05.747
So if you want...

539
01:03:07.830 --> 01:03:13.711
Look, this does not happen as planned. Okay.

540
01:03:15.755 --> 01:03:19.801
Think about it. Okay;

541
01:03:21.219 --> 01:03:24.222
Okay.

542
01:03:27.683 --> 01:03:32.146
I love you. Watch yourselves.

543
01:03:33.523 --> 01:03:39.487
Well. Goodbye.

544
01:03:52.625 --> 01:03:57.213
People go to shelters, but time is short.

545
01:03:57.296 --> 01:04:01.342
This is your responsibility, Weller.

546
01:04:18.192 --> 01:04:22.238
- How's Doctor?
- Almost done.


547
01:04:22.321 --> 01:04:26.451
You can tell as soon as just cum.

548
01:04:33.124 --> 01:04:35.169
Everything ready.

549
01:04:44.343 --> 01:04:51.517
- Hey wait, Neil. Why are we stopped?
- I need to correct something. What to corrections?


550
01:04:51.601 --> 01:04:56.647
The lightning destroyed a battery.
The latter may also be lost.


551
01:04:56.731 --> 01:05:02.540
I disconnect the broken, then we can
get out of the eye of the storm in time.


552
01:05:03.080 --> 01:05:04.697
Neil, the storm is just upon us.

553
01:05:12.100 --> 01:05:15.463
COMMAND: OVERRIDE LOCKOUT.

554
01:05:16.084 --> 01:05:20.463
- Oxygen level 100 percent.
- Neil, a second this is my uniform.


555
01:05:20.546 --> 01:05:25.802
OK, the repair goes quickly. Neil is
broken! I will return immediately.


556
01:05:25.885 --> 01:05:30.932
- Open the door.
- Wait, Neil!


557
01:05:38.564 --> 01:05:43.986
Doctor, when you connect these cables
have to leave as soon as possible.


558
01:05:44.070 --> 01:05:50.034
It is almost time, but to
have time to pass us by storm.

559
01:05:57.125 --> 01:06:03.714
- Oh. Yeah... Miranda, you hear me?
- Neil, why you left the Rover?


560
01:06:03.798 --> 01:06:09.011
It is the only
solution, baby. I am sorry.

561
01:06:09.095 --> 01:06:13.307
Foster, I figured it.

562
01:06:13.391 --> 01:06:18.187
There is only enough energy
for one of us to succeed.

563
01:06:18.271 --> 01:06:23.985
There is no life support. You need to wear the
uniform. When you finish, the take off from here.


564
01:06:24.068 --> 01:06:29.699
- What's up with you; I broke.
- The mission of Elli is critical.


565
01:06:29.782 --> 01:06:35.096
Your mission is critical,
but not me. Not anymore.

566
01:06:35.329 --> 01:06:40.477
When I do. When the storm cleared, they
will come to find you and pick you up.


567
01:06:43.463 --> 01:06:50.094
You're more valuable to people
here on Mars than on Earth.

568
01:06:50.178 --> 01:06:54.165
Therefore, I hope you
stay I'll see you around.

569
01:06:54.348 --> 01:07:02.065
- And how long do you find all this?
- From the ditch, and when I gave Ellie oxygen, I was sure.


570
01:07:02.148 --> 01:07:07.445
Risking the lives of all
in each MLA, without ask me?

571
01:07:07.528 --> 01:07:12.825
- No doctor, I risked my own.
- Neil return to Rover and find a way.


572
01:07:12.909 --> 01:07:19.630
I work on it, Miranda. Oxygen does not last for
both of us and the Rover has little power.


573
01:07:20.673 --> 01:07:22.255
Get back into the Rover, Neil.

574
01:07:24.378 --> 01:07:31.010
There is more at stake. 
Mars needs you and Foster.

575
01:07:31.094 --> 01:07:37.725
- This is the only solution.
- Foster, to go out and help him!


576
01:07:40.853 --> 01:07:42.641
The air lock is not responding.

577
01:07:44.233 --> 01:07:50.947
Yes, I broke the system. 
You need permission to open it.

578
01:07:51.030 --> 01:07:57.078
- Hell, Neil!
- Foster, go and get him!
- I'm working on it!


579
01:08:00.498 --> 01:08:06.212
The antenna is broken. But the battery
could not handle another discharge.


580
01:08:06.295 --> 01:08:10.049
I have almost finished, Doctor.

581
01:08:12.635 --> 01:08:18.516
- Prepared to leave.
- Do not give up, Neil.
- I giving up.


582
01:08:18.599 --> 01:08:24.147
- We do that must be done.
- Oxygen level 100 percent.


583
01:08:24.230 --> 01:08:29.277
Miranda, the last ten years has been,

584
01:08:29.360 --> 01:08:33.823
the best in my life.
- Oh my god.


585
01:08:33.906 --> 01:08:41.038
Say to Ellie that I love. 
Ellie i love you.

586
01:08:41.122 --> 01:08:46.961
It is not your fault. 
Install EMF transmitter.

587
01:08:47.044 --> 01:08:52.717
I love you and I'm proud of you.

588
01:08:52.800 --> 01:08:56.262
Goodbye, Miranda.

589
01:08:59.390 --> 01:09:04.353
- Take care of my family, Pete.
- Neil?


590
01:09:15.740 --> 01:09:19.077
I am very sorry about it.

591
01:09:30.421 --> 01:09:34.671
- Foster?
- Miranda, he is gone.


592
01:09:41.349 --> 01:09:45.520
I... I am very sorry about it.

593
01:09:45.603 --> 01:09:50.274
Miranda, the brand will soon disappear.

594
01:09:50.358 --> 01:09:55.655
If you hear, make sure
that the transmitter is ready EMF.

595
01:09:55.738 --> 01:09:57.992
And look toward the horizon.

596
01:09:59.767 --> 01:10:03.326
Listen here... 
Neil was right.

597
01:10:05.515 --> 01:10:09.978
Mars is our future.

598
01:10:12.171 --> 01:10:16.426
I would like to ask
Ellie to come with me.

599
01:10:16.509 --> 01:10:21.848
Foster, you stupid idiot. We have
no intention to leave behind anyway.


600
01:10:23.099 --> 01:10:27.395
To promise me one thing only, Miranda.

601
01:10:27.478 --> 01:10:31.025
Bring Ellie home. Only once.

602
01:10:37.321 --> 01:10:43.453
I do not think I could save
the Earth, but I can save Mars.

603
01:10:55.131 --> 01:10:59.427
Foster? Foster!

604
01:10:59.510 --> 01:11:04.307
It's time to get to safety. Do not
do that, Reiger. Mission failed!


605
01:11:04.390 --> 01:11:08.895
The Neil is dead, maybe Foster. Jupiter
is here, whether you like it or not!


606
01:11:08.978 --> 01:11:13.941
Now, I'm sorry, Miranda. You play with
the life of the colony for a long time!


607
01:11:14.025 --> 01:11:19.655
Here Reiger. Start closing. Redirect
all the power in emergency shelters.


608
01:11:21.199 --> 01:11:24.827
Or agree to come with
us, or will to conceive.

609
01:11:24.911 --> 01:11:28.581
Not ordinary sandstorm.

610
01:11:28.664 --> 01:11:35.116
- If you do not take the opportunity to stop,
then all that we fight will be lost.
- We disagree with that.


611
01:11:35.379 --> 01:11:39.322
Lambert, grasp the Weller director. 
We're checking out.

612
01:11:40.551 --> 01:11:46.724
Alison, at least give the plan a chance Foster. If you
run the power elsewhere, the transmitters will not work.


613
01:11:48.142 --> 01:11:52.355
Andrew, now.

614
01:11:53.856 --> 01:12:00.738
Alison. Ellie is there
and tries to stop it.

615
01:12:00.822 --> 01:12:06.647
- Are you going to sacrifice?
- I hope to find a safe place.


616
01:12:09.414 --> 01:12:14.232
We must hurry! We need to get to
the top and place the transmitter.


617
01:12:15.545 --> 01:12:20.050
We must be ready when dad
arrived in the eye of the storm.

618
01:12:24.095 --> 01:12:29.100
- Eva, oxygen control.
- 100% oxygen level.


619
01:12:29.183 --> 01:12:34.647
- At 4%.
- To replace the tube. We will continue with this.


620
01:12:52.540 --> 01:12:58.129
- You probably need to get inside.
- Not without you.


621
01:13:01.758 --> 01:13:08.014
- Do you still think you do it right?
- Can Foster to stop the storm?


622
01:13:08.097 --> 01:13:13.519
- What if the transmitter has power?
- The Foster is the smartest I know.


623
01:13:13.603 --> 01:13:18.566
- If anyone can, that is.
- What are we going to do;
- Leave it to me.


624
01:13:21.069 --> 01:13:26.449
Take my handcuffs. We must now ensure the
supply of EMF transmitter. You have it.


625
01:13:26.532 --> 01:13:31.579
- Lambert!
- Wait! Miranda!
- Open the door now!
- I'm sorry, captain.


626
01:13:31.662 --> 01:13:37.585
- You can take the tunnel from there.
- If it is wrong, then you will die!


627
01:13:37.668 --> 01:13:44.675
- But if he is right, many people will live!
- Lambert!


628
01:14:11.619 --> 01:14:14.137
Andrew, this is Jupiter.

629
01:14:16.666 --> 01:14:22.088
- I wish we had uniforms.
- Hopefully it's not necessary. Come on.


630
01:14:24.132 --> 01:14:28.303
Okay, Jupiter. 
Let's look at why you are capable.

631
01:14:35.530 --> 01:14:37.040
This will work.

632
01:14:52.869 --> 01:14:54.728
Ida is ready. Ida? Ida!

633
01:14:58.750 --> 01:15:03.796
Oh, God, you silly. Ida, hold on!

634
01:15:10.636 --> 01:15:17.060
Hold on! Hold on, Ida!

635
01:15:20.646 --> 01:15:23.775
Oh my God.

636
01:15:29.113 --> 01:15:30.575
Check it.

637
01:15:33.534 --> 01:15:38.372
- He's dead.
- Not very long. He came here with the transmitter.


638
01:15:38.456 --> 01:15:45.046
There is an emergency cord here.
It takes strength, what does Reiger.


639
01:15:49.383 --> 01:15:55.131
- Miranda!
- I know! OK let's go!


640
01:15:58.768 --> 01:16:01.979
Come on!

641
01:16:07.944 --> 01:16:09.195
Come on.

642
01:16:13.035 --> 01:16:17.062
- What are we doing now;
- We must hope that Foster did.


643
01:16:24.627 --> 01:16:31.509
- Oxygen is critical.
- Thanks, Eve.


644
01:16:31.592 --> 01:16:36.931
You have three minutes to
return to the transfer medium.

645
01:17:12.215 --> 01:17:13.365
Ida!

646
01:17:43.746 --> 01:17:45.148
Please, Ida!

647
01:17:53.841 --> 01:17:58.054
We can get out of this roof now?

648
01:18:00.390 --> 01:18:05.812
Take a deep breath. 
Let's get out of here.

649
01:18:46.644 --> 01:18:52.233
You have one minute to
return to the transfer medium.

650
01:18:52.316 --> 01:18:54.694
Shut up.

651
01:19:01.784 --> 01:19:05.204
That's it.

652
01:19:12.879 --> 01:19:17.675
If it continues to record...

653
01:19:19.844 --> 01:19:23.639
For Ellie.

654
01:19:26.350 --> 01:19:31.898
If you are safe
then I did my job.

655
01:19:36.611 --> 01:19:40.156
I love you.

656
01:19:42.492 --> 01:19:45.870
For Miranda.

657
01:19:47.455 --> 01:19:53.044
Sorry for Neil. 
He saved my life more than once.

658
01:19:54.712 --> 01:19:58.679
Without him, none of this would have worked.

659
01:20:02.095 --> 01:20:05.848
He was a good man.

660
01:20:08.768 --> 01:20:13.940
And for the rest of humanity.

661
01:20:17.151 --> 01:20:19.604
When I'm here now,

662
01:20:22.949 --> 01:20:28.162
making death, realize the...

663
01:20:32.041 --> 01:20:37.213
That Mars will continue trying to kill you.

664
01:20:40.341 --> 01:20:45.221
So being smart.

665
01:20:45.304 --> 01:20:52.437
You have already destroyed a planet.
Do not do the same with him.


666
01:20:56.566 --> 01:21:01.863
Not after all these sacrifices.

667
01:21:40.318 --> 01:21:43.821
So, father...

668
01:21:43.905 --> 01:21:49.202
- Returns to Earth now?
- We need you here, Foster.


669
01:21:50.787 --> 01:21:52.647
I do not go anywhere.

670
01:21:54.648 --> 01:22:04.648
