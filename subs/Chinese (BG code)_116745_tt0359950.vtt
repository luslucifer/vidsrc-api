00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:32.221
无法执行请求

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:34.221
嗯?

今天有什么能为您效劳?
How can I help you today?


12
00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:36.627
你好 我好像无法给别人发送表情
Hi. I can't seem to leave a wink for someone.


13
00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:38.060
我不知道 是我的页面崩溃了吗?
I don't know, is my page broken?


14
00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:40.103
是否进入了错误的页面 或者...
Do I maybe have a broken page, or...


15
00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.501
我从没遇到这种情况 但是没关系
I've never heard of that, but, okay.


16
00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:45.100
你是第一次使用你的网恋网账户吗?
You're trying to use your eHarmony account for the first time?


17
00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:46.507
- 是的  - 好的
- I am.  - Okay.


18
00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:48.981
我正在看你的简介
I'm looking at your profile.


19
00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:51.182
我们有一个非常复杂的匹配算法
We have a pretty intricate matching algorithm.


20
00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:53.230
这是我们和其他在线交友网站
That's what distinguishes us from other


21
00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:54.230
不一样的地方
online dating services.


22
00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:55.541
没错 我欣赏这一点
Yeah, I like that.


23
00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:58.984
其实 我只是想给一个人发送表情
Actually, I'm just trying to leave a wink for one person.


24
00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:00.630
她叫谢尔·梅霍芙
Cheryl Melhoff.


25
00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:03.386
她在一个月前进入我的部门工作...
She started in my division at work about a month ago...


26
00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:05.028
我偶然在面包店附近听她说
and I overheard her near the bagels


27
00:04:05.028 --> 00:04:06.828
她在你们网站征婚
saying she was on your site.


28
00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:08.505
好吧 真特别的情况
Okay, that's unique.


29
00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:09.701
但我想问个问题
But let me ask you.


30
00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:11.305
你有很多项...
You left a lot of this stuff...


31
00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:15.351
比如"你的经历"的部分空着没填
like the "Been There, Done That" section, you left it blank.


32
00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:17.224
没错 我跳过了这部分
Yeah, I think I skipped it.


33
00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:19.185
好吧 你不能为难我 先生
Okay, you got to help me out here, man.


34
00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:20.751
不要省略信息
Don't skip stuff.


35
00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:24.340
好吧 但是我真没去过
Okay, well, I haven't really been


36
00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:26.906
任何有名或值得一提地方
anywhere noteworthy or mentionable.


37
00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:31.869
有没有你曾做过值得一提的事情?
Have you done anything noteworthy, mentionable?


38
00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:37.343
你好 你还在听吗?
Hello, you still there?


39
00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:39.549
你能稍等一下吗?
Can you hang on a second?


40
00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:51.382
快 快 快! 让开! 让开!
Go, go, go! Get out! Get out!


41
00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:54.350
快爆炸啦! 快走! 快走!
She's gonna blow! Go! Go!


42
00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:58.109
- 奇普!  - 在这里!
- Chips!  - Over here!


43
00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:00.260
奇普! 谢谢!
Chips! Thank you!


44
00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:01.541
你怎么知道这楼会爆炸?
How did you know about the building?


45
00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:03.429
我听到犬吠声 还闻到了煤气味
I heard barking, thought I smelled gas.


46
00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:04.786
但愿它没事
I hope it's okay.


47
00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:06.510
我在冲下楼梯的时候
I engineered a prosthesis for Chips


48
00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:08.221
顺便给奇普做了一个假肢
while I was sprinting down the stairwell.


49
00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:09.835
一个固定在臀部
A little hip-joint assembly


50
00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:12.022
套在前骨盘 还有垂环锁的小假肢
with a drop-ring lock and an anterior pelvic band.


51
00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:13.701
天啊 你真让人刮目相看!
God, you're noteworthy!


52
00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:17.069
我是三有青年: 有魄力 有勇气 有创造力
I just live by the ABC's: Adventurous, Brave, Creative.


53
00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:19.140
这就是我理想中的男人啊
That's everything I want in a man.


54
00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:22.741
先生?
My man?


55
00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:24.704
嘿 先生 你还在听吗?
Hey, my man, you still there?


56
00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:28.066
嘿
Hey.


57
00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:30.389
怎么了? 你是晕过去了还是...
What? Did you pass out or...


58
00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:32.703
不是 我只是出神了
No, I just like, zoned out for a second.


59
00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:35.067
好吧 你经常这样吗?
Okay. Do you do that a lot?


60
00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:38.941
我想 也就普通频率
Normal amount, I guess.


61
00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:42.586
我得走了 抱歉
Yeah, I got to run. Sorry.


62
00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:44.265
好吧 但我们需要更多的...
Okay, but we need a lot more...

白日梦想家

64
00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:24.067
嘿 今天可不是迟到的好日子
Hey. Bad day to be late.


65
00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:25.631
我们公司刚刚被收购了
We just got acquired.


66
00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:27.509
- 什么?  - 是的 就在周末

华特! 生日快乐!

68
00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:30.955
喔呼!

他四十二岁了!
He's 42 years old!


70
00:06:33.140 --> 00:06:34.904
欧黛纱! 你来这里干嘛?
Odessa! What are you doing here?


71
00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:37.462
你妈做了你最喜欢的小柑橘蛋糕
Mom made you your favorite clementine cake.


72
00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:39.315
你不是应该在养老院
Aren't you supposed to be at the retirement place


73
00:06:39.340 --> 00:06:40.785
帮妈把钢琴搬进去吗?
with her getting the piano moved in?


74
00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:42.465
没错 我在那里 干完差不多一半了...
Yes, I was there. It's like halfway done...


75
00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:45.464
把钢琴从货车里搬出来 在街上放着 一切都很顺利
piano's out of the van, it's on the street, everything's fine.


76
00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:47.260
但我刚好接了个很重要的试镜
But I just got a phone call about a really


77
00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:48.990
所以你能帮我搬钢琴吗?
big audition, so can you go finish it?


78
00:06:49.140 --> 00:06:51.188
- 不行 我要迟到了  - 华特 我...
- No, I can't. I'm late.  - Walter, I...


79
00:06:51.340 --> 00:06:53.820
我觉得你没明白我需要什么
I don't think you're seeing this from what I need.


80
00:06:53.980 --> 00:06:55.106
你需要什么?
What do you need?


81
00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:57.467
我要成为"火爆浪子"里的里佐
I need to be Rizzo in Grease.


82
00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:57.467
1978年出品的电影 改编自音乐剧"西边故事"

83
00:06:57.940 --> 00:06:59.021
我没明白
I don't understand that.


84
00:06:59.180 --> 00:07:01.421
- 我的试镜! 里佐!  - 里佐?
- My audition! Rizzo!  - Rizzo?


85
00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:03.635
里佐! 她既强硬又温柔!
Rizzo! She's tough and tender!


86
00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:03.635
里佐是个叛逆女孩 试图用强硬的外表掩盖痛苦和自卑

87
00:07:03.660 --> 00:07:04.661
放过我吧 求你了
Do me a favor, please.


88
00:07:04.820 --> 00:07:07.140
不管你用什么办法 一定要把妈妈的钢琴搬进去 好吗?
Make sure Mom's piano gets moved in all the way. All right?


89
00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:08.831
不要当里佐!
Don't go to Rizzo!


90
00:07:08.980 --> 00:07:11.631
谢你全家 华特 生日快乐!

而且要做一些调动
Yeah, there's gonna be changes.


94
00:07:16.380 --> 00:07:20.021
很可能会把我们下调到一些网络部门去
Downsizing of us into some kind of dot-com thing, possibly.


95
00:07:21.020 --> 00:07:22.943
真是前途未卜
I wonder how this thing goes down,


96
00:07:23.100 --> 00:07:25.023
过渡期又该怎么过
how the transition's gonna play out.


97
00:07:25.180 --> 00:07:26.466

And what do you do, cake man?


102
00:07:40.780 --> 00:07:41.781
哦 呃...
Oh, uh...


103
00:07:43.620 --> 00:07:46.942
这蛋糕只是今天才有 我不是蛋糕师
The cake's just for today. I'm not a cake man.


104
00:07:47.100 --> 00:07:48.465

107
00:07:53.020 --> 00:07:56.183
处理"生活"杂志的所有图片...
Directly with LIFE's photo units...


108
00:07:56.380 --> 00:07:58.435
不好意思 我完全沉浸在这首歌里
I'm sorry, I was really getting into this song


109
00:07:58.460 --> 00:08:00.383
没听见你说什么
and I stopped listening to you.


110
00:08:03.660 --> 00:08:05.708
我刚刚说 你知道谁留胡子好看吗?
I was saying, you know who looks good in a beard?


111
00:08:05.860 --> 00:08:07.544
是邓布利多 不是你
Dumbledore, not you.


112
00:08:05.860 --> 00:08:07.544
邓布利多: 出自"哈利·波特"系列

Worth the wait.


118
00:08:29.860 --> 00:08:32.067
# 楞个里格楞 #
# Mind over matter #


119
00:08:38.500 --> 00:08:40.070
- 嘿 泰德  - 唐尼

120
00:08:40.820 --> 00:08:42.584
- 还适应吗?  - 非常好

00:09:03.180 --> 00:09:05.581
这个周末糟透了
I had an awesome weekend.


128
00:09:22.380 --> 00:09:24.064
这个周末你都做了什么?
And what did you do this weekend?


129
00:09:24.380 --> 00:09:26.269
唔... 我想想
Um... Let's see.


130
00:09:26.900 --> 00:09:29.631
我用北极冰泉泡了个澡...
I bathed in Arctic mountain water...


131
00:09:29.780 --> 00:09:32.101
我的拉丁情人在一旁背诗给我听
while my Latin lover recited verse to me.


132
00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:34.069
- 真会意淫  - 对吧
- You slut.  - I know.


133
00:09:34.220 --> 00:09:37.144
事实上 我在等冰箱修理工 可他一直没有来
Actually, I waited for my refrigerator repairman, who never came.


134
00:09:37.300 --> 00:09:38.631
真悲剧
I'm so sorry.


135
00:09:38.820 --> 00:09:39.821
晚点给你打电话
I'm gonna call you later.


136
00:09:39.940 --> 00:09:40.941
好的
Okay.


137
00:09:45.340 --> 00:09:46.701
冰 对吧?
The ice, yes?


138
00:09:46.740 --> 00:09:48.265
她就像女人一样无常
She moves like a woman.


139
00:09:50.020 --> 00:09:52.148
我叫华特·米蒂
I'm Walter Mitty.


140
00:09:52.580 --> 00:09:55.026
我叫谢尔·梅霍芙
Cheryl Melhoff.


141
00:09:55.180 --> 00:09:56.466
你去哪里了?
Where have you been?


142
00:09:56.620 --> 00:09:58.987
测试人类精神的极限
Testing the limits of the human espirit.


143
00:10:00.140 --> 00:10:03.110
我想爬上你的头发 测试一下
I'd like to climb your hair, test that out.


144
00:10:03.300 --> 00:10:07.225
我可以用我的传情猎鹰跟你联系
Perhaps I can contact you, possibly through my poetry falcon.


145
00:10:07.460 --> 00:10:08.700
传情猎鹰
Poetry falcon.


146
00:10:08.860 --> 00:10:09.861
我喜欢这名字
I like that.


147
00:10:14.540 --> 00:10:17.384
要是我拿回形针打他一下 他会不会动呢?
Do you think, if I hit him with a paper clip, would he move?


148
00:10:17.540 --> 00:10:18.635
不知道
I don't know.


149
00:10:18.660 --> 00:10:19.821
试试
Do it.


150
00:10:19.980 --> 00:10:21.391
来
Hello.


151
00:10:21.540 --> 00:10:23.907
我曾经真的朝他扔过一个墨盒
I actually threw a toner box at him once.


152
00:10:24.060 --> 00:10:25.141
是吗? 他动了吗?
Yeah? Did he move?


153
00:10:25.300 --> 00:10:26.790
没有 我扔偏了
No, I missed.


154
00:10:27.500 --> 00:10:29.423
真是个好故事
That's a great story.


155
00:10:30.420 --> 00:10:32.263
塔台呼叫汤姆上校
Ground Control to Major Tom.


156
00:10:33.140 --> 00:10:35.541
你能听见吗 汤姆上校?
Can you hear me, Major Tom?


157
00:10:38.500 --> 00:10:39.501
哦!
Oh!


158
00:10:42.340 --> 00:10:43.671
哇
Wow.


159
00:10:45.180 --> 00:10:47.547
我们接着往下说
Moving on, as they say.


160
00:10:48.540 --> 00:10:51.350
这是会议室 这边是办公室...
Conference room, more of these stations here...


161
00:10:51.500 --> 00:10:53.229
大部分时间员工各干各的
where people sort of do their thing.


162
00:10:53.340 --> 00:10:54.546
这样布局是为了...
Layout's here for...


163
00:11:05.020 --> 00:11:06.510
早上好 赫南多!
Morning, Hernando!


164
00:11:06.700 --> 00:11:09.021
新来了个难缠的家伙 你听说了吗?
There's a new nut pouch, did you hear?


165
00:11:10.220 --> 00:11:12.985
是的 我见过他了
Yeah. I met him.


166
00:11:13.140 --> 00:11:14.426
我们要被重新考核
We're gonna be evaluated.


167
00:11:14.620 --> 00:11:17.590
不过他们考核不了 我们这活还是很难的
They won't be able to. We do intricate details back here.


168
00:11:17.740 --> 00:11:18.755
没错
Yeah.


169
00:11:18.780 --> 00:11:20.589
这活很麻烦 而且容易出错
It's tricky. And bewildering.


170
00:11:20.740 --> 00:11:23.061
应该让我们互相考核
I should evaluate you, you should evaluate me.


171
00:11:23.220 --> 00:11:24.660
我觉得他们不会让我们这么做的
I don't think they'll let us do that.


172
00:11:24.780 --> 00:11:25.827
说说而已
Just saying.


173
00:11:29.460 --> 00:11:31.642
这卷底片放在这里多久了?
Hey, how long has this neg roll been here?


174
00:11:31.642 --> 00:11:32.942
放在外面的这卷
Out in the open.


175
00:11:36.340 --> 00:11:37.387
上面写着"肖恩·奥康奈尔"
It says "Sean O'Connell."


176
00:11:37.540 --> 00:11:39.224
今天早上拿来的
It came in this morning.


177
00:11:39.380 --> 00:11:42.270
还有个礼物 他寄给你一份礼物 就在你桌上
There's a present, too. He sent you a present, on your desk.


178
00:11:44.100 --> 00:11:45.864
肖恩·奥康奈尔还在用胶卷拍照
Sean O'Connell still shoots on film.


179
00:11:46.380 --> 00:11:48.382
我真是很喜欢他
That results for me in a man crush.


180
00:11:50.420 --> 00:11:52.024
嘿 你想洗这盒胶卷吗?
Hey, you want to mount these?


181
00:11:52.260 --> 00:11:53.341
真的我来?
Seriously?


182
00:11:53.540 --> 00:11:54.780
当然
Sure.


183
00:12:05.780 --> 00:12:08.624
听说"生活"杂志破产了
Heard rumblings LIFE's done, man.


184
00:12:08.780 --> 00:12:10.066
我想对你道谢
Wanted to say thanks.


185
00:12:10.460 --> 00:12:14.306
看看里面的东西 作为你多年努力工作的礼物
Take a look inside, a gift for all the years of hard work.


186
00:12:14.780 --> 00:12:16.305
至于底片胶卷 我很抱歉
Sorry about the neg roll.


187
00:12:17.140 --> 00:12:18.869
我自己缝合...
I spilled some blood on it...


188
00:12:19.060 --> 00:12:20.744
腹部枪伤的时候 溅了点血在胶卷上面...
while self-stitching a gun wound to my abdomen...


189
00:12:20.940 --> 00:12:24.149
但二十五号是我拍得最好的一张
but number 25 is my best ever.


190
00:12:24.300 --> 00:12:27.144
我认为是生活的精髓
The quintessence of life, I think.


191
00:12:27.300 --> 00:12:29.462
我相信你会把它放在属于它的位置上...
I trust you'll get it where it needs to go...


192
00:12:29.740 --> 00:12:31.310
你总能做到
you always do.


193
00:12:45.740 --> 00:12:47.041
感谢你所做的一切

194
00:12:51.740 --> 00:12:52.741
你拿的是什么?
What did you get?


195
00:12:54.980 --> 00:12:56.345
钱包
It's a wallet.


196
00:13:03.860 --> 00:13:05.669
有"生活"杂志的格言在上面
With LIFE's motto on it.


197
00:13:05.860 --> 00:13:06.860
认识世界 克服困难

198
00:13:06.860 --> 00:13:07.860
洞悉所有 贴近生活

199
00:13:07.860 --> 00:13:08.860
寻找真爱 感受彼此

200
00:13:08.860 --> 00:13:09.860
这就是生活的意义

201
00:13:14.140 --> 00:13:15.426
给你
Here you go.


202
00:13:21.860 --> 00:13:23.703
- 二十五号呢?  - 没有
- Where's 25?  - It's not there.


203
00:13:26.500 --> 00:13:29.344
嘿 我们需要二十五号底片
Hey, we need negative 25.


204
00:13:29.860 --> 00:13:32.545
肖恩·奥康奈尔发了电报
Sean O'Connell sent a telegram.


205
00:13:32.700 --> 00:13:33.701
是真的电报
An actual telegram.


206
00:13:33.860 --> 00:13:35.828
一个带着小帽子的百岁老人传信的
A 100-year-old dude came in a little hat.


207
00:13:37.220 --> 00:13:38.426
所以要开个楼层会议
So there's a floor meeting.


208
00:13:39.380 --> 00:13:41.030
带上二十五号底片
Bring 25.


209
00:13:44.700 --> 00:13:46.907
肯定还在这 我们会找到它的
It's here somewhere. We'll find it.


210
00:13:47.220 --> 00:13:49.791
好的 尽快制作这些框架的关系表
Okay, make a contact sheet of these frames as soon as you can.


211
00:13:49.940 --> 00:13:51.115
而且别跟任何人提起这事
And don't say anything to anyone.


212
00:13:51.140 --> 00:13:52.221
好的
Yeah.


213
00:13:52.540 --> 00:13:56.465
我很不情愿地要通知大家...
I just wanted to inform you all reluctantly, that...


214
00:14:02.740 --> 00:14:05.471
我想得重头再说一遍
I guess, just start back from the beginning.


215
00:14:05.620 --> 00:14:08.749
好了 我很不情愿地要通知大家...
Okay. I just wanted to inform you all reluctantly...


216
00:14:08.900 --> 00:14:12.268
本月的期刊将会是我们的最后一期
that this month's issue will be our last.


217
00:14:12.900 --> 00:14:14.035
什么?
What?


218
00:14:14.060 --> 00:14:15.061
是的 什么?
Yeah. What?


219
00:14:15.780 --> 00:14:17.464
扯淡!
This is some bull!


220
00:14:18.260 --> 00:14:19.307
是坏消息...
It's sad...


221
00:14:20.620 --> 00:14:22.588
确实如此
news, for sure.


222
00:14:24.260 --> 00:14:26.262
你们都是难得的好员工
Now, you're all valued employees.


223
00:14:26.420 --> 00:14:30.061
但由于我们处于"生活"杂志网络化的过渡期...
But as we undergo this transition to LIFE online...


224
00:14:30.220 --> 00:14:31.790
所以我们想明白告诉你们...
we wanted to be candid with you...


225
00:14:31.940 --> 00:14:35.467
将有部分员工被新公司...
that some of you will be determined non-vital employees...


226
00:14:35.660 --> 00:14:37.310
列为非重要员工
to the new partnership.


227
00:14:37.460 --> 00:14:39.428
而我们将在下周的例会上...
And we'll be deciding which of those positions...


228
00:14:39.620 --> 00:14:42.988
决定保留哪些职位
will be remaining with us over the course of the next week.


229
00:14:43.140 --> 00:14:47.190
正如你所见 我们也对此感到悲伤
Also, we feel sad about that, as you can see.


230
00:14:48.740 --> 00:14:49.741
现在是好消息
Now for some good news.


231
00:14:49.900 --> 00:14:51.902
- 我们非常激动地...  - 够了 唐
- We are very excited...  - All right, Don.


232
00:14:52.580 --> 00:14:55.868
我是泰德·亨德里克斯 过渡期的主管经理
Ted Hendricks. Managing director of the transition.


233
00:14:56.900 --> 00:14:59.426
眼下的形势 并不乐观
Never fun, this stage.


234
00:14:59.740 --> 00:15:03.062
但我们确实获得允许来出版...
But we do have ahead of us the privilege of publishing...


235
00:15:03.220 --> 00:15:06.986
这最后一期的"生活"月刊杂志
what will be the very last issue of LIFE magazine.


236
00:15:07.460 --> 00:15:10.595
而这最后一期 我们刚刚收到了一封电报
And for the final issue, we just received a telegram.


237
00:15:10.620 --> 00:15:11.715
给我
Come on.


238
00:15:11.740 --> 00:15:14.061
肖恩·奥康奈尔发来的...
From Sean O'Connell...


239
00:15:14.220 --> 00:15:16.382
据说他从不愿意...
who has never, I'm told, been willing...


240
00:15:16.540 --> 00:15:18.429
和公司的高管接触
to speak with the executives here.


241
00:15:18.580 --> 00:15:20.150
然而这次 他打破了长期的沉默
Well, he broke his long silence


242
00:15:20.300 --> 00:15:21.904
跟我们分享了他的想法...
and shared his thoughts with us...


243
00:15:22.060 --> 00:15:24.904
通过那位老伯
through that old man.


244
00:15:26.820 --> 00:15:28.185
我是肖恩·奥康奈尔
Sean O'Connell.


245
00:15:28.340 --> 00:15:33.107
"我希望能以二十五号底片作为封面"
"I expect full consideration of negative 25 for cover."


246
00:15:33.420 --> 00:15:34.945
"我最高的杰作"
"My most grand."


247
00:15:35.100 --> 00:15:38.468
"生活的精髓"
"The quintessence of life."


248
00:15:39.820 --> 00:15:40.946
精髓是啥?
What is that?


249
00:15:41.740 --> 00:15:43.583
好像是指充实而富有
It means like the fullest and most rich.


250
00:15:43.740 --> 00:15:46.061
好了 因此我们下一期封面将会非常轰动...
Okay. So our cover will probably be the most famous ever...


251
00:15:46.220 --> 00:15:49.702
因为它真的蕴含生活的精髓
because it really will have the big quintessence of all time.


252
00:15:49.900 --> 00:15:53.109
充实而富有
Very full and so rich.


253
00:15:55.860 --> 00:15:57.510
那么让我们见识一下 怎样?
So let's see this thing. Huh?


254
00:15:57.700 --> 00:15:59.031
看下那照片
Let's see it.


255
00:15:59.180 --> 00:16:01.911
我们... 我现在在这里干什么? 下面该怎么办?
Can we... What am I doing up here? What's going on?


256
00:16:02.060 --> 00:16:03.505
我们现在向底片资产部拿到这个底片
We'll receive it now from Negative Assets.


257
00:16:03.700 --> 00:16:04.940
就是那位先生 最后一个进来的
This gentleman. The last man in.


258
00:16:05.060 --> 00:16:06.266
底片资产部 那是什么?
Negative Assets. What's that?


259
00:16:06.420 --> 00:16:07.501
啊 汤姆上校
Ah, Major Tom.


260
00:16:08.340 --> 00:16:10.741
能把照片给我吗?
Can I get that?


261
00:16:13.540 --> 00:16:15.429
底片还在处理中
It's being processed.


262
00:16:16.300 --> 00:16:17.461
好的 那现在开工吧
All right. Well, let's do it.


263
00:16:17.620 --> 00:16:19.987
去搞定那生活的精髓吧
Let's process some quintessence.


264
00:16:20.380 --> 00:16:21.381
开始吧
Come on.


265
00:16:22.220 --> 00:16:23.221
行动起来
Go.


266
00:16:23.820 --> 00:16:24.875
马上
Now.


267
00:16:24.900 --> 00:16:26.425
这就是拍手的原因
That's why I'm clapping.


268
00:16:26.580 --> 00:16:28.548
- 我们什么时候印刷?  - 两周半后
- When do we go to press?  - Two and a half weeks.


269
00:16:42.500 --> 00:16:43.501
你好
Hi.


270
00:16:43.980 --> 00:16:44.981

00:16:48.220 --> 00:16:49.248
我叫谢尔

273
00:16:49.248 --> 00:16:50.348
- 米蒂  - 梅霍芙

274
00:16:50.780 --> 00:16:51.827

Yes.


275
00:16:54.220 --> 00:16:56.143
- 你在摄影师账户部工作 是吗?  - 是的
- You work in Photo Accounts, right?  - I do.


276
00:16:56.340 --> 00:16:57.421
你在底片资产部
Negative Assets.


277
00:16:57.580 --> 00:16:58.911
是的
Yes. I am.


278
00:16:59.060 --> 00:17:01.904
你在处理最后一期封面照片 那可是件大工程
You're processing the last cover photo. That's a big deal.


279
00:17:02.060 --> 00:17:04.950
是的 这个... 有一点... 我们遇到一点困难
Yeah, it's... there's a... we have a glitch.


280
00:17:05.140 --> 00:17:06.585
一点点小问题
Mini, on that one right now.


281
00:17:06.740 --> 00:17:08.310
我想跟你说...
I wanted to say, to you...


282
00:17:09.100 --> 00:17:13.025
你有没有肖恩·奥康奈尔的住址?
do you maybe have an address for Sean O'Connell?


283
00:17:14.060 --> 00:17:16.315
唔... 这可能不好找
Um... It's not really that easy with him.


284
00:17:16.340 --> 00:17:18.024
他居无定所 我不知道
He moves around so much. I don't.


285
00:17:18.180 --> 00:17:19.420
是啊 他是自由投稿者
Yeah, he's on a freelance.


286
00:17:19.580 --> 00:17:22.345
我不知道他的住址 而且他也没有电话
I don't know where and he doesn't have a phone.


287
00:17:22.500 --> 00:17:24.980
- 没有电话? 他很传统  - 是的
- No phone? He's old school.  - Yeah.


288
00:17:28.220 --> 00:17:30.029
对了 我去找佩吉查一下吧?
But, you know, why don't I check with Peg?


289
00:17:30.180 --> 00:17:31.989
她刚刚准备了一张给肖恩的支票
I know she just processed a check for him.


290
00:17:32.140 --> 00:17:34.950
我们也许可以查送信地址 用这种方式找他?
And we could track his pay-out maybe. Find him that way?


291
00:17:35.540 --> 00:17:38.430
- 很好 太好了  - 好的
- Cool. Very cool.  - Okay.


292
00:17:38.580 --> 00:17:40.184
- 你叫华特  - 是的
- Walter.  - Yes.


293
00:17:40.380 --> 00:17:41.666
我去办
I'm on it.


294
00:17:41.820 --> 00:17:42.981
谢谢
Thanks.


295
00:17:43.180 --> 00:17:44.261
你要进来吗?
Yes. Are you coming?


296
00:17:44.500 --> 00:17:45.945
是的 不用了
Yes, I'm not.


297
00:17:46.300 --> 00:17:48.223
是的 我得呆在这儿
Yes, I have to stay.


298
00:17:50.180 --> 00:17:52.660
这是相版
Here's the contact sheet.


299
00:17:58.700 --> 00:17:59.940
你看到什么了?
What do you see?


300
00:18:00.100 --> 00:18:02.228
那送来的胶卷
This photo cluster. These three.


301
00:18:02.380 --> 00:18:04.109
只有这三张是有图像的
They're the only printable ones.


302
00:18:04.260 --> 00:18:06.388
这几张是他在拍25号的同时拍的
He took them around the same time he took 25.


303
00:18:06.660 --> 00:18:09.106
根据这些线索可能能找到肖恩
They could give us a clue to where Sean is.


304
00:18:09.260 --> 00:18:10.261
洗出这几张 好吗?
Blow them up, all right?


305
00:18:10.380 --> 00:18:11.381
好的
Cool.


306
00:18:26.660 --> 00:18:28.344
嘿
Hey.


307
00:18:28.660 --> 00:18:30.230
华特 是吗?
Walter, right?


308
00:18:33.100 --> 00:18:34.181
是的
Yeah.


309
00:18:34.580 --> 00:18:37.424
我跟佩吉说了肖恩的事情了 她会回电话给我
So, I called Peg about Sean. She's gonna get back to me.


310
00:18:37.780 --> 00:18:39.191
哦! 嘿 谢谢了
Oh! Hey, thanks.


311
00:18:40.100 --> 00:18:42.501
好酷的眼镜 很有沙人的感觉
Cool glasses, very Sand People.


312
00:18:43.540 --> 00:18:45.941
这个吗? 不是的 这是小型放大镜
These? No, these are loupes.


313
00:18:46.100 --> 00:18:47.704
我工作的时候用的 它能放大...
They're for work. They magnify the...


314
00:18:47.860 --> 00:18:49.862
这就是25号吗? 我能看看吗?
Is that 25? Can I see?


315
00:18:50.020 --> 00:18:51.101
这个... 不是
That's... No.


316
00:18:51.900 --> 00:18:54.744
我还没找到25号...
I can't quite find 25...


317
00:18:54.900 --> 00:18:56.425
目前来说
just now.


318
00:18:56.580 --> 00:18:58.070
你没找到?
You can't find it?


319
00:18:58.220 --> 00:19:00.029
是的 所以我才想要去找肖恩
Yeah. That's why I'm trying to find Sean.


320
00:19:00.180 --> 00:19:04.390
我试着根据其他的照片找到他的下落
I'm trying to track him down somehow with these other images.


321
00:19:05.460 --> 00:19:06.541
他的行踪吗?
His whereabouts?


322
00:19:06.700 --> 00:19:07.861
是的
Yeah.


323
00:19:09.860 --> 00:19:12.386
我上过一个关于写悬疑小说的课
I take this class, Writing the Mystery Novel.


324
00:19:13.060 --> 00:19:15.062
他们说关键是逆向思维
Anyway, they say the key is to work backwards.


325
00:19:15.220 --> 00:19:17.422
收集所有线索 然后再各个分析
You connect the clues and then scatter them


326
00:19:17.422 --> 00:19:18.622
可能看上去毫无联系
so they seem unrelated.


327
00:19:18.780 --> 00:19:20.544
推理可复杂了呢
There's like a whole science to it.


328
00:19:21.260 --> 00:19:22.705
- 我可以看看嘛?  - 当然
- May I?  - Sure.


329
00:19:23.820 --> 00:19:25.902
好的 大拇指
Okay. Thumb.


330
00:19:26.300 --> 00:19:28.906
是的 不知道是谁的
Yeah. It's an unknown thumb.


331
00:19:29.060 --> 00:19:30.983
好吧 水面?
Okay. Water?


332
00:19:32.300 --> 00:19:33.426
就是水吧 我猜?
Just water, I guess?


333
00:19:33.620 --> 00:19:34.667
是的 就是水
Yeah, just water.


334
00:19:34.780 --> 00:19:35.827
好的
Okay.


335
00:19:35.980 --> 00:19:37.311
还有...
And...


336
00:19:38.740 --> 00:19:41.346
好像是一个弧形...
like a curved piece of...


337
00:19:41.500 --> 00:19:45.300
像是某个东西的一部分
some kind of, part of a thing.


338
00:19:47.580 --> 00:19:49.582
但是我的老师说 关于线索...
But the thing with clues, my teacher says...


339
00:19:49.740 --> 00:19:51.500
肯定会有一个关键
is you really only need one good one,


340
00:19:51.500 --> 00:19:52.420
将所有线索联系起来...
and then they'll connect...


341
00:19:52.420 --> 00:19:53.140
然后你就会觉得
and you'll be like,


342
00:19:53.140 --> 00:19:55.185
"哦 是啊 当然 无名的大拇指 水面..."
"Oh, yes, of course, unknown thumb, water..."


343
00:19:55.340 --> 00:19:57.661
"我早就该想到的 哈!"
"I should have seen this the whole time. Ahh!"


344
00:19:58.340 --> 00:20:01.150
是啊 是啊 我会试着...
Yeah, yeah, I'll be like...


345
00:20:05.260 --> 00:20:09.310
好吧 不管怎样 我该回去了 不然我就要被炒鱿鱼了
Well, anyway, I should get back and try not to get fired.


346
00:20:14.260 --> 00:20:15.261
嘿 谢尔
Hey, Cheryl.


347
00:20:17.660 --> 00:20:19.700
我也在做一些创作
I have something creative I've been working on, too.


348
00:20:19.780 --> 00:20:20.781
哦
Oh.


349
00:20:21.100 --> 00:20:22.750
就是一个小工程
Little side project.


350
00:20:27.700 --> 00:20:29.543
华特 真的太美了!
Walter, it's amazing!


351
00:20:30.100 --> 00:20:31.545
华特?
Walter?


352
00:20:32.500 --> 00:20:34.940
我刚刚说如果佩吉给我回电话了 我会告诉你的
I was just saying I'll let you know when I hear back from Peg.


353
00:20:35.860 --> 00:20:37.703
好的 谢谢
Okay. Thank you.


354
00:20:38.060 --> 00:20:39.141
好的
Okay.


355
00:20:46.620 --> 00:20:47.860
嘿 欧黛纱
Hey, Odessa.


356
00:20:49.420 --> 00:20:50.546
什么?
What?


357
00:20:59.060 --> 00:21:02.189
能否换个大点的公寓? 能放下这个钢琴的
Is there a larger apartment available the piano could fit in?


358
00:21:02.460 --> 00:21:04.701
那个是我妈妈的纪念物
Because it's a memento of our mom's.


359
00:21:04.860 --> 00:21:06.988
真的太大了...
That's a really big...


360
00:21:07.580 --> 00:21:10.470
很多人在搬来之前都会把太大件的纪念物卖掉
Most people sell their really big mementos before they move here.


361
00:21:10.620 --> 00:21:12.941
我爸爸在他们结婚那年给她买了这架钢琴
My dad bought it for her the year they were married.


362
00:21:13.140 --> 00:21:15.302
对她来说意味着很多
It means a lot to her.


363
00:21:16.380 --> 00:21:18.223
这是个别墅 有点儿贵...
That's a villa. It's a little more costly...


364
00:21:18.380 --> 00:21:21.827
但是它绝对宽敞 有足够放得下钢琴的客厅
but it has a more generous, piano kind of size living room for you though.


365
00:21:22.020 --> 00:21:23.385
好的 这个很好
Yeah. Yeah, this is good.


366
00:21:23.580 --> 00:21:24.786
如果要搬进去 你需要有第一个月的
On move-in, you'd need first month's,


367
00:21:24.940 --> 00:21:26.180
最后一个月的 以及全部的存款
last month's, and full deposit.


368
00:21:26.260 --> 00:21:28.024
- 4700块钱  - 棒
- That's $4,700.  - Great.


369
00:21:28.340 --> 00:21:29.435
好的 没问题
Yeah, okay.


370
00:21:29.460 --> 00:21:30.915
- 我们会买的  - 我去拿文件
- Yeah, we'll take it.  - I'll get the paperwork.


371
00:21:30.940 --> 00:21:33.068
新的别墅会在三周以后开放
The new villa comes open in three weeks.


372
00:21:33.220 --> 00:21:34.346
我猜
I'm guessing.


373
00:21:37.220 --> 00:21:38.267
生日快乐
Happy birthday.


374
00:21:39.780 --> 00:21:42.181
弹力强人!
Stretch Armstrong!


375
00:21:42.340 --> 00:21:43.626
棒极了
That's cool.


376
00:21:43.740 --> 00:21:45.026
是啊 很不错不是吗?
Yeah. Isn't that awesome?


377
00:21:45.180 --> 00:21:47.786
这可是你小时候最喜欢的玩具 还记得吗?
This was your favorite thing when we were little. Do you remember?


378
00:21:47.940 --> 00:21:49.180
还想来一次吗?
You want to do it?


379
00:21:49.380 --> 00:21:50.381
好啊
Yeah, all right.


380
00:21:50.540 --> 00:21:53.305
来吧 使劲儿拉! 很好 很好!
Come on, Stretch! Good, good!


381
00:21:53.460 --> 00:21:54.461
好了 我们得走了
Come on, we got to go.


382
00:21:54.620 --> 00:21:57.544
一幢别墅 好吧 但是搞清楚 我可不想太奢华
A villa, okay, but hey, I'm not the Queen of Sheba.


383
00:21:57.700 --> 00:21:59.100
你得有个能装得下钢琴的房间
You got to have room for your piano.


384
00:21:59.140 --> 00:22:00.551
那边收拾好之前你就先住在我这边吧
You can stay at my place until it's ready.


385
00:22:00.700 --> 00:22:02.702
我在这儿不会太束缚你吗?
I won't be cramping your scene?


386
00:22:02.860 --> 00:22:04.225
束缚我? 不会
My scene? No.


387
00:22:04.380 --> 00:22:06.100
很抱歉没让你今天住进去
And sorry we couldn't get you in here today.


388
00:22:06.220 --> 00:22:07.221
华特!
Walter!


389
00:22:07.380 --> 00:22:09.382
你看我找到了什么!
Look what I found!


390
00:22:09.540 --> 00:22:11.827
这是你和蒂姆·林德曼的
This is from you and Tim Linderman.


391
00:22:11.980 --> 00:22:14.221
你还记不记得 那时候我们收拾东西准备去欧洲玩儿?
Do you remember, we were gonna backpack Europe?


392
00:22:14.380 --> 00:22:15.745
爸爸去世的那个六月?
That June Dad died?


393
00:22:15.900 --> 00:22:18.107
伙计! 来看看里面有什么?
Man! What is in here?


394
00:22:18.260 --> 00:22:19.421
那是我的家族盒子
That's my Walter box.


395
00:22:19.620 --> 00:22:22.100
有一些咱们家的小摆设和纪念品什么的
Some of my Walter knick-knacks and keepsakes.


396
00:22:22.580 --> 00:22:24.548
你做的音乐选集是最棒的!
You made the best mix tapes!


397
00:22:24.860 --> 00:22:27.227
- 天啊  - 怎么了? 那是什么?
- Oh, man.  - What? What's that?


398
00:22:27.540 --> 00:22:29.588
爸爸给我的旅行日志
Travel journal Dad gave me.


399
00:22:29.700 --> 00:22:30.701
哦
Oh.


400
00:22:30.940 --> 00:22:33.705
你应该把它捐了 因为你从来没用过 捐给贫困的小孩子吧
You should donate that, because you never used it, to a poor kid.


401
00:22:33.860 --> 00:22:35.862
一个准备去欧洲旅行的贫困小孩吗?
A poor kid who's gonna travel to Europe?


402
00:22:36.020 --> 00:22:37.863
你看你和你爸爸!
Look at you and your dad!


403
00:22:38.020 --> 00:22:39.101
那个是我比赛的那张照片吗?
Is that my tournament one?


404
00:22:39.260 --> 00:22:41.069
他对这个得意的不得了
He was so proud of this.


405
00:22:43.140 --> 00:22:45.461
他真想和全世界分享你的成就
Sharing your accomplishments with the whole world.


406
00:22:45.940 --> 00:22:47.942
那只是个小镇上的比赛 妈妈
It's from the Fairview Smalltowner, Mom.


407
00:22:48.100 --> 00:22:50.751
我真的超喜欢那个帅帅的莫霍克头
Well, I really liked that nifty mohawk.


408
00:22:51.260 --> 00:22:52.540
你知道吗 你爸爸去世后...
You know, when your daddy died...


409
00:22:52.580 --> 00:22:54.787
你就去比萨店工作...
and then you went to work in that pizza place...


410
00:22:54.940 --> 00:22:58.475
那家店以一个父亲命名 就是类似父亲的名字
the one that was named after a father, had that father kind of name.


411
00:22:58.500 --> 00:22:59.501
棒约翰
Papa John's.


412
00:22:59.620 --> 00:23:00.635
是的 送外卖
Yeah, delivery.


413
00:23:00.660 --> 00:23:03.635
那个时候我就想...
And I thought perhaps that it was really sad for you...


414
00:23:03.660 --> 00:23:05.555
在你爸爸去世后 在一个那样名字的店里工作
working in a restaurant named after a father


415
00:23:05.580 --> 00:23:07.264
你会很难过吧
after your father just died.


416
00:23:08.460 --> 00:23:10.030
我从来没往那方面想
I never even thought about that.


417
00:23:11.180 --> 00:23:13.069
可能是因为我从来不叫老爸 "爸爸" 吧
Probably because I didn't call Dad "Papa."


418
00:23:13.260 --> 00:23:14.785
你穿得真怪
You had a weird style.


419
00:23:14.940 --> 00:23:17.386
不是我穿得怪 那个是肯德基的制服
That wasn't my style. That was a uniform. KFC.


420
00:23:18.260 --> 00:23:19.755
我家勤劳的小蜜蜂
My worker bee.


421
00:23:23.540 --> 00:23:24.780
"水中有字"?
"Word in the water"?


422
00:23:24.980 --> 00:23:26.584
好了 知道吗? 我得走了
Okay, you know what? I got to go.


423
00:23:26.740 --> 00:23:28.742
我们会让你尽快住进别墅 好吗?
We're getting you into a villa situation, okay?


424
00:23:28.940 --> 00:23:30.101
- 好的  - 很好 我走了
- Okay.  - Good, everybody?


425
00:23:30.260 --> 00:23:31.307
我家勤劳的小蜜蜂...
My worker bee...


426
00:23:31.460 --> 00:23:33.261
- 还有我家爱表演的小蜜蜂!  - 谢谢你 妈妈
- and my performance artist bee!  - Thank you, Mom.


427
00:23:38.940 --> 00:23:40.305
- 赫南多  - 嘿
- Hernando.  - Hey.


428
00:23:42.300 --> 00:23:43.825
- 我什么都没看到  - 在中间偏上
- I don't see anything.  - Upper middle.


429
00:23:43.980 --> 00:23:45.823
很模糊 但是水里的确有字
It's faint. There's a word in the water.


430
00:23:51.260 --> 00:23:53.149
我很紧张 华特
I'm getting nervous, Walter.


431
00:23:55.660 --> 00:23:57.105
嘿 这是某片海洋
Hey, this is an ocean.


432
00:23:57.300 --> 00:23:58.825
那是艘船
That's a boat.


433
00:23:59.900 --> 00:24:01.789
"厄基斯那克"
"Erkigsnek."


434
00:24:01.940 --> 00:24:04.102
他在那艘船附近
He was near this boat.


435
00:24:05.380 --> 00:24:06.461
一会儿见
See you in a few.


436
00:24:06.620 --> 00:24:07.860
我去查看一下收发室
I'll check the mailroom.


437
00:24:15.460 --> 00:24:16.871
终刊封面
Final cover.


438
00:24:17.740 --> 00:24:19.344
责任重大啊
Big responsibility.


439
00:24:20.740 --> 00:24:21.946
哦 这是我想要的照片吗?
Oh, is that my quintessence?


440
00:24:23.420 --> 00:24:24.910
不是
No.


441
00:24:25.380 --> 00:24:27.860
我们正在为开始做准备呢
We're prepping the wetting agents on that to start the process.


442
00:24:27.980 --> 00:24:30.711
真的吗? 因为你好像还在玩玩具
Really? Because it looks like you're playing with toys.


443
00:24:31.660 --> 00:24:34.550
不是 这个是礼物
No, this is a gift.


444
00:24:34.700 --> 00:24:36.782
底片需要经过一系列专业的...
Yeah, the negative needs to go through a very technical...


445
00:24:36.940 --> 00:24:39.784
抱歉 我没办法和你进行有关专业的对话
I'm sorry. I can't have a professional conversation with you.

你不能带着他穿过办公室
You can't walk through the office with him.


449
00:24:48.100 --> 00:24:49.864
- 给我吧  - 我会收起来的
- Let's have it.  - I'll put it away.


450
00:24:50.740 --> 00:24:52.310

现在
Now.


452
00:24:53.940 --> 00:24:57.342
这是工作的地方 不是玩玩具的地方!
This is a place of business, not a place of jelly-man toys!


453
00:24:57.500 --> 00:24:58.547
放手!
Get off it!


454
00:24:58.740 --> 00:24:59.741
不 我不放!

那是我的! 给我!

不!
No!


458
00:25:17.500 --> 00:25:20.583
别抓着我的小伙伴不放!
Stop fiddling with sweets and little men!


459
00:25:20.740 --> 00:25:23.186
这才是我该做的!
I'm trying to do my job!


460
00:26:23.380 --> 00:26:25.269
你是铁皮人吗?
Are you the Tin Man?


461
00:26:26.020 --> 00:26:28.102
需不需要给你上点油?
Need a little oil can?


462
00:26:28.820 --> 00:26:29.867

我们需要完善你的信息 使之没有空格
we need to beef your profile up, make it, you know, not blank.

473
00:26:59.100 --> 00:27:00.101
呃...
Um...


474
00:27:00.620 --> 00:27:01.951
我去过凤凰大学
Phoenix.


475
00:27:02.100 --> 00:27:03.590
我忘了为什么去了
I forgot why.


476
00:27:03.780 --> 00:27:04.827
然后是纳什维尔...
Then Nashville...


477
00:27:04.980 --> 00:27:06.141
但那只是去凤凰城路过那边的机场
but that was just the airport on the way


478
00:27:06.260 --> 00:27:07.740
所以我不知道算不算...
to Phoenix, so I don't know if that...


479
00:27:07.780 --> 00:27:08.781
嗯哼...
Uh-huh...


480
00:27:08.900 --> 00:27:12.029
嘿 伙计 我在想 如果你跟那姑娘在一起工作的话...
Hey, man, I was thinking, if you work with this girl...


481
00:27:12.260 --> 00:27:15.821
为什么不直接邀请她出去呢?
why don't you just humanly invite her out?


482
00:27:16.020 --> 00:27:18.751
不 不 不 我是想要试着像"椰奶鸡尾酒之歌"那样
No, no, no, I'm trying to do like a "Pina Colada Song" thing.


483
00:27:18.900 --> 00:27:20.061
"椰奶鸡尾酒之歌"?
"Pina Colada Song"?


484
00:27:20.220 --> 00:27:22.302
是啊 一个人发了一个广告 寻找爱人...
Yeah, you know, a guy posts an ad, looking for a lover...


485
00:27:22.460 --> 00:27:23.700
然后他的妻子回复了他...
and then his wife answers it...


486
00:27:23.860 --> 00:27:26.181
然后两个从不认识到一见钟情...
and it turns out they were soul mates and didn't even know it...


487
00:27:26.340 --> 00:27:29.583
最后他们披着披风做爱 或是躺在披风上
and they end up making love in capes, or on a cape.


488
00:27:29.740 --> 00:27:32.391
这是首歌吗? 你能唱一段吗?
It's a song? Can you sing a little bit?


489
00:27:32.540 --> 00:27:36.067
如果你椰奶鸡尾酒 当被大雨淋湿
If you like pina coladas, getting caught in the rain


490
00:27:36.220 --> 00:27:37.301
知道这首歌吗? 我得挂了
You know that song? I have to go.


491
00:27:37.420 --> 00:27:38.501
是霍尔与奥茨的歌吗?
Is that Hall & Oates?


492

00:27:42.020 --> 00:27:43.510
- 是啊 这个线索很不错  - 是吗?
- Yeah. This one's okay.  - Yeah?


495
00:27:44.100 --> 00:27:46.148
我想这里有一艘船
There's a boat there, I think.


496
00:27:46.700 --> 00:27:48.907
- "厄基..."  - 斯那克

497
00:27:49.060 --> 00:27:50.391
- 厄基斯那克?  - 是的
- Erkigsnek?  - Yeah.


498
00:27:50.540 --> 00:27:51.666

他在和朋友滑滑板
He's skateboarding with a friend.


508

你得找到肖恩·奥康奈尔
You lost a Sean O'Connell.


514

我以前在纳贝斯克工作

515
00:28:25.340 --> 00:28:29.664
然后 我的生活发生了点变化...
And then, I had a change...


516
00:28:29.820 --> 00:28:32.141
我决定申请来生活杂志工作
and I decided to apply to LIFE.


517
00:28:32.300 --> 00:28:35.782
想着这边应该会更丰富多彩 少些局限 我猜是这样
Thought it would be more colorful, less regular, I guess.


518
00:28:35.940 --> 00:28:38.511
你知道 我只是喜欢它的理念

00:29:37.580 --> 00:29:39.025
那就是你的...
It's your...


545
00:29:39.180 --> 00:29:42.070
前任老公 刚刚离的
Former. Newly former.


546
00:29:42.220 --> 00:29:45.064
但是我们还是... 我也不知道
But we've been sort of... I don't know.


547
00:29:45.220 --> 00:29:46.900
我不用接
I don't need to get it.


548
00:29:50.060 --> 00:29:52.711
那么 你儿子玩的是哪种滑板呢?
So, what kind of skateboard does your son have?


549
00:29:53.740 --> 00:29:55.390
呃 我也不知道!
Um, I have no idea!


550
00:29:55.740 --> 00:29:57.708
就是长长的 我也不知道是什么
It's oblong. I don't know.


551
00:29:57.860 --> 00:30:00.181
- 干嘛问这个?  - 没有 我只是...
- Why?  - No, I just...


552
00:30:00.780 --> 00:30:04.705
我以前... 我以前也玩过
I used to... I was kind of into the scene.


553
00:30:05.540 --> 00:30:06.871
- 你玩过滑板?  - 是的
- The skateboard scene?  - Yeah.


554
00:30:07.140 --> 00:30:08.187
哇哦!
Wow!


555
00:30:08.900 --> 00:30:10.265
嗨 佩吉
Hi, Peg.


556
00:30:10.420 --> 00:30:13.549
是的 就是肖恩·奥康奈尔 我们得找到他
Yeah, it's Sean O'Connell, we actually need to find him.


557
00:30:16.020 --> 00:30:18.227
是的 如果你能尽快的话
Yes. If you could hurry.


558
00:30:18.740 --> 00:30:19.946
翻板
Kickflip.


559
00:30:20.220 --> 00:30:21.460
是的
Yeah.


560
00:30:21.860 --> 00:30:23.624
这个是保留节目的经典动作
It's a good one for the repertoire.


561
00:30:24.740 --> 00:30:26.105
我是华特
I'm Walter.


562
00:30:26.260 --> 00:30:27.307
我是理查
Rich.


563
00:30:27.460 --> 00:30:29.980
是的 我想他可能知道点儿什么或者有什么对我们有用的东西
Yeah, we think he might know something or have an asset we need.


564
00:30:30.100 --> 00:30:31.590
知道吗 你只要在用一点劲儿...
You know, you just got to get a little more snap...


565
00:30:31.780 --> 00:30:33.225
让滑板起得来
get that thing up there.


566
00:30:34.380 --> 00:30:36.144
要我给你示范一下吗?
Want me to show you something?


567
00:30:36.780 --> 00:30:38.384
好吧
Sure.


568
00:30:40.420 --> 00:30:41.421
给
Here.


569
00:30:42.580 --> 00:30:43.627
我喜欢你的滑板
I like your trucks.


570
00:30:43.900 --> 00:30:44.981
谢谢
Thanks.


571
00:30:46.300 --> 00:30:47.745
现在来看看这个
Now check this out.


572
00:30:49.740 --> 00:30:51.504
- 知道怎么跳吗?  - 嗯哼
- Know about the flick?  - Uh-huh.


573
00:30:51.900 --> 00:30:55.063
是的 我们已经处理完他四月份的工作订单了
Yeah, we've finished processing his April work order.


574
00:31:01.780 --> 00:31:03.748
是的 这个很重要
Yes, it's kind of important.


575
00:31:06.580 --> 00:31:09.550
税表你也发送过去了?
Did you forward the job 1090s?


576
00:31:10.220 --> 00:31:11.904
他最后的工资你也预填了?
Or his last salary?


577
00:31:13.100 --> 00:31:14.261
哇哦!
Wow!


578
00:31:18.100 --> 00:31:19.226
哇哦!
Wow!


579
00:31:19.660 --> 00:31:21.071
- 还给你  - 这太屌了
- Here you go.  - That was awesome.


580
00:31:21.220 --> 00:31:22.341
所以哪里都有可能
So it could be either place.


581
00:31:22.420 --> 00:31:24.070
- 谢谢 华特  - 好的 谢谢 佩吉
- Thanks, Walter.  - Okay. Thanks, Peg.


582
00:31:24.220 --> 00:31:25.221
好的
All right.


583
00:31:26.620 --> 00:31:27.781
嘿 情况是...
Hey, so...


584
00:31:27.940 --> 00:31:29.624
肖恩肯定不在纽约
Sean's definitely not in New York.


585
00:31:29.780 --> 00:31:31.350
佩吉说她发送了好几份出去
Peg said she sent multiples.


586
00:31:31.500 --> 00:31:33.502
我不确定你知不知道他的习惯
I don't know if you know how it works with him.


587
00:31:33.660 --> 00:31:36.504
因为我们都不知道他在哪里 所以她发了好几份出去
She sends copies because we never know where he's gonna be.


588
00:31:36.660 --> 00:31:39.743
这次她把税表发到新泽西的普林斯顿
And this week she sent 10903 to Princeton, New Jersey.


589
00:31:39.980 --> 00:31:41.903
这方便啊 火车直达
Oh, great. Train ride.


590
00:31:42.180 --> 00:31:43.625
而另一个发去了格陵兰
And one to Greenland.


591
00:31:43.780 --> 00:31:44.781
以保万一
Just in case.


592
00:31:45.620 --> 00:31:47.304
格陵兰 丹麦那个?
Greenland, the country?


593
00:31:48.340 --> 00:31:49.421
那就...
That's...


594
00:31:50.740 --> 00:31:52.151
不是火车的距离了
You can't take a train there.


595
00:31:52.340 --> 00:31:53.501
是啊
No.


596
00:31:53.660 --> 00:31:55.503
- 他也可能在新泽西  - 对啊
- Well, maybe he's in Jersey.  - Yeah.


597
00:31:55.660 --> 00:31:58.470
对了 你手机搜索那船名有结果了吗?
Yeah, is your phone done buffering with that ship's name?


598
00:31:58.660 --> 00:32:00.708
读取好了! 看这里
Yes! Look. Here it is.


599
00:32:00.860 --> 00:32:03.022
在格陵兰岛的努克
Nuuk, Greenland.


600
00:32:04.140 --> 00:32:05.955
好哎!
Yeah!


601
00:32:05.980 --> 00:32:07.141
拜托 这线索不错的!
Come on, that's a good lead!


602
00:32:07.300 --> 00:32:09.143
你应该进一步跟进
You should follow that up.


603
00:32:09.980 --> 00:32:11.982
是啊 一路跟去格陵兰
Yeah, follow it up in Greenland.


604
00:32:12.140 --> 00:32:14.347
是啊 怎么了? 追过去啊!
Yeah. Why not? Go!


605
00:32:14.500 --> 00:32:15.990
破解谜案
Crack the case.


606
00:32:16.140 --> 00:32:17.710
钱包上的字就是你的心声
Listen to your wallet.


607
00:32:20.980 --> 00:32:24.155
对不起 是... 菲尔又打过来了
Sorry, it's my... it's Phil again.


608
00:32:24.180 --> 00:32:26.786
他估计有麻烦或者什么事了 我还是接一下比较好
Maybe he fell down a well or something. Maybe I should get it.


609
00:32:26.980 --> 00:32:28.061
嘿 伙计! 过来!
Hey, buddy! Here!


610
00:32:28.220 --> 00:32:30.029
理查 理查! 别这么快! 过来!
Rich, Rich! Not so fast! Here!


611
00:32:30.180 --> 00:32:31.341
这个你拿着
Take that.


612
00:32:33.220 --> 00:32:35.029
好的 我知道了
Yeah. I understand.


613
00:32:35.500 --> 00:32:37.150
好的 再见
Okay. Bye.


614
00:32:38.380 --> 00:32:39.984
他的确惹了些麻烦
He did fall down a well.


615
00:32:40.700 --> 00:32:42.065
但我不在乎
But I don't care.


616
00:32:42.220 --> 00:32:44.666
我只想和你在一起 懂吗?
I just want to be with you, you know?


617
00:32:44.900 --> 00:32:45.901
真的?
Really?


618
00:32:46.060 --> 00:32:49.348
我们私奔吧 让我们活在当下 立刻马上
Let's run away together. Let's make every moment count, starting now.


619
00:32:49.580 --> 00:32:50.581
好极了!
Sweet!


620
00:32:52.020 --> 00:32:53.075
我能跟你说件事吗?
Can I tell you something?


621
00:32:53.100 --> 00:32:54.147
任何事都行
Anything.


622
00:32:56.180 --> 00:32:58.342
我喜欢"奇幻逆緣"那种设定
I have that Benjamin Buttons thing.


623
00:32:59.260 --> 00:33:01.262
年纪越老 体格变得越小
Where you get old, but smaller.


624
00:33:01.420 --> 00:33:04.503
反正就这意思 最后 变成一个外表老头的婴儿
Or whatever, and become a gradual old baby. Or something.


625
00:33:04.820 --> 00:33:07.266
我没看过那电影 所以确切的细节也不太清楚
I didn't see the movie, so I don't really know how it works.


626
00:33:07.420 --> 00:33:08.660
但我买了碟片
But I have it.


627
00:33:09.660 --> 00:33:11.662
就算这样 我们也能一起生活在一起
We can still build a life together.


628
00:33:12.260 --> 00:33:13.261
爽
Cool.


629
00:33:26.940 --> 00:33:29.420
我喜欢你这件可爱的小衬衫
I like your snappy little suit.


630
00:33:29.900 --> 00:33:32.107
我在玩偶店买的
I bought it at a doll store.


631
00:33:32.620 --> 00:33:33.746
哦 很好啊
Oh. Cool.


632
00:33:35.740 --> 00:33:39.028
我的小心脏已经不足硬币大小...
My little heart is no bigger than a quarter...


633
00:33:39.860 --> 00:33:42.625
但里面却很充实
but it's as full as Fort Knox.


634
00:33:43.460 --> 00:33:45.747
你是我见过最勇敢的人
You're the bravest man I've ever known.


635
00:33:46.860 --> 00:33:48.589
我爱你 宝贝
I love you, baby.


636
00:33:48.740 --> 00:33:51.391
不是"婴儿" 而是...
Not like "baby," like...


637
00:33:51.540 --> 00:33:55.386
因为你长的就像一个奇怪的婴儿一样
because you look like a little weird baby-man.


638
00:33:56.460 --> 00:33:57.746
我懂的
I get it.


639
00:33:58.260 --> 00:34:00.995
谢谢你给了我如此美满的人生
Thank you for such a wonderful life.


640
00:34:05.100 --> 00:34:08.104
静静地躺着 走完这一世吧
Just nestle in here and die.


641
00:34:10.820 --> 00:34:12.948
再见 华特
Good-bye, Walter.


642
00:34:13.500 --> 00:34:14.911
再见了! 华特!
Good-bye! Walter!


643
00:34:15.820 --> 00:34:17.948
华特! 华特!
Walter! Walter!


644
00:34:18.100 --> 00:34:19.306
- 再见!  - 哦!
- Bye!  - Oh!


645
00:34:19.460 --> 00:34:20.791
不好意思! 我只是有点...
Sorry! I was just...


646
00:34:21.140 --> 00:34:22.904
你要去哪里?
Where do you go?


647
00:34:23.060 --> 00:34:24.949
我刚刚在想...
I started thinking about...


648
00:34:25.140 --> 00:34:27.901
算了 没事 估计我的破冰箱的事情也无聊到你了
No, it's okay, I was probably boring you about my broken refrigerator.


649
00:34:27.940 --> 00:34:28.941
没有的事!
No!


650
00:34:29.620 --> 00:34:30.635
理查!
Rich!


651
00:34:30.660 --> 00:34:33.027
我儿子快跑远了 我要走了
My son's running into the street. I have to go.


652
00:34:33.180 --> 00:34:34.625
好的
Yeah.


653
00:34:34.780 --> 00:34:38.023
跟你说件事 那首"汤姆上校"
I wanted to tell you, that song, "Major Tom"?


654
00:34:38.180 --> 00:34:40.865
之前 那个大胡子...
Back there, when the beard guy was...


655
00:34:41.780 --> 00:34:42.986
他根本不知道他在说什么
He doesn't know what he's talking about.


656
00:34:43.140 --> 00:34:47.190
那首歌讲的是勇敢和对未知的探索
That song is about courage and going into the unknown.


657
00:34:47.980 --> 00:34:49.266
很赞的一首歌
It's a cool song.


658
00:34:53.180 --> 00:34:54.705
理查!
Rich!


659
00:35:04.820 --> 00:35:05.821
哟!
Yo!


660
00:35:06.660 --> 00:35:08.788
我的东西呢?
Where's my thing?


661
00:35:08.980 --> 00:35:11.187
浸在银盐液槽里了
It's in a silver bath.


662
00:35:12.380 --> 00:35:14.348
我都不知道你在说哪门外星语了
I don't even know what language you're speaking right now.


663
00:35:14.500 --> 00:35:16.309
告诉你 你最好别给我打马虎眼
You know, you got to take me seriously.


664
00:35:16.460 --> 00:35:18.508
我手上还要出版最后一期的杂志
I got a magazine to execute here.


665
00:35:18.660 --> 00:35:20.503
而且还有上头的差事
And bosses to answer to.


666
00:35:20.660 --> 00:35:23.630
下次我看到你的时候 照片也要在 懂了吗?
So next time I see you, I see that picture. Okay?


667
00:35:25.060 --> 00:35:26.346
嘿! 白日梦的家伙!
Hey! Dream Machine!


668
00:35:26.500 --> 00:35:27.501
叫你呢
Hello.


669
00:35:28.500 --> 00:35:30.343
只是... 我就想确认一下你听到我说的话了
Just... I want proof you heard me.


670
00:35:32.140 --> 00:35:33.869
下次我看到你...
Next time I see you...


671
00:35:35.380 --> 00:35:36.506
就能看到照片
You see the picture.


672
00:35:37.060 --> 00:35:38.869
这就对了!
That's right!


673
00:35:45.380 --> 00:35:47.382
运气如何 赫南多?
Any luck, Hernando?


674
00:35:47.540 --> 00:35:50.191
这地方都被我翻了个遍 25号照片不在这里
I turned the place upside-down. 25 is not here.


675
00:35:50.340 --> 00:35:51.751
连收件室都查过了 伙计
I searched Receiving, too, man.


676
00:35:53.220 --> 00:35:55.222
这不可能的!
This never happens!


677
00:35:55.700 --> 00:35:57.190
我跟你说...
I'm telling you...


678
00:35:57.340 --> 00:35:58.580
它不见了 华特
it's nowhere, Walter.


679
00:36:00.540 --> 00:36:03.703
我的意思是 他可能就没有发过来
I mean, maybe he didn't even send it.


680
00:36:04.340 --> 00:36:05.944
或者照片还在他那里
Maybe it's still on him.


681

放眼全世界

685
00:37:06.820 --> 00:37:11.462
# 有些事 #
# Something filled up #


686
00:37:13.940 --> 00:37:18.980
# 充实我的内心 #
# My heart with nothing #


687
00:37:21.020 --> 00:37:27.824
# 有些人 教我不要哭泣 #
# Someone told me not to cry #


688
00:37:34.540 --> 00:37:39.023
# 如今我已变老 #
# Now that I'm older #


689
00:37:41.820 --> 00:37:46.189
# 我的心也随之冰冷 #
# My heart's colder #


690
00:37:48.500 --> 00:37:55.224
# 才明白 一切不过一场骗局 #
# And I can see that it's a lie #


691
00:38:27.780 --> 00:38:29.781
努克镇

就那辆红色的好了
I'll take the red one.


697
00:39:35.620 --> 00:39:40.786
# 你曾在酒吧做服务员 #

699
00:39:44.100 --> 00:39:48.310
# 我们约会过 感动过 回首过 #
# I picked you out, I shook you up and turned you around #


700
00:39:48.500 --> 00:39:51.663
# 改变了你的一切 #
# Turned you into someone new #


701
00:39:52.340 --> 00:39:53.830
- 嗨  - 嗨

Can I ask you, could someone receive mail here?


703
00:39:58.300 --> 00:40:00.428
收件人是个美国人? 叫肖恩·奥康奈尔?
An American? Sean O'Connell?


704
00:40:00.580 --> 00:40:03.311
我认为他可能把邮件地址写这里了
I think he might have received mail at this address.


705
00:40:03.820 --> 00:40:05.902
你要喝一杯吗?
You want a drink?


706
00:40:06.740 --> 00:40:08.344
好吧 也行啊 要不...

所以 这里能收到信件吗?
So, could somebody get mail here?

710
00:40:17.020 --> 00:40:18.021
"机邮"?
"Heli mail"?


711
00:40:18.340 --> 00:40:21.469
有船路过的时候 我们用直升机把邮件送过去
We helicopter mail to the ships when they pass by.


712
00:40:21.660 --> 00:40:23.788

我把音量调小点
I'm gonna take it down a little, here.


718
00:40:34.820 --> 00:40:36.663
我打心底说一句
I just want to speak from the heart.


719
00:40:36.980 --> 00:40:38.664
我错过了一个好女人
I lost a good lady.


720
00:40:39.180 --> 00:40:42.150
我觉得这首歌让我不觉得那么孤单
I feel this song is helping me feel like I'm not alone.


721

726
00:40:53.100 --> 00:40:55.023
你知道一般谁送邮的吗?
Do you know who flies the mail out?


727
00:40:55.180 --> 00:40:57.155
或者常飞那边的飞行员?
Do you have regular pilots?


728
00:40:57.180 --> 00:40:58.235

740
00:41:23.060 --> 00:41:24.107
够了吗?
Okay?


741
00:41:24.580 --> 00:41:25.991
难听死了
That sucked.

00:41:26.100 --> 00:41:27.195
做你的事去
Do your work.


743
00:41:27.220 --> 00:41:28.221
推推嚷嚷的不好
You don't have to push.


744
00:41:29.260 --> 00:41:31.183
- 我还戳你了 怎么着?  - 住手 别戳我
- What if I poke you?  - Stop. Don't poke me.


745
00:41:31.980 --> 00:41:33.345
- 你敢怎么着 伙计  - 别戳我!
- Do your work, man.  - Don't poke me!

747
00:41:35.180 --> 00:41:37.069
别戳我! 不准戳我!
Stop poking me! Don't poke me!


748

00:41:50.500 --> 00:41:51.911
等一下 等一下!
Wait, wait. Wait!


752
00:41:52.460 --> 00:41:54.460
你的大拇指! 我要跟你谈谈你的大拇指!
Your thumb! I have to talk to you about your thumb!


753
00:41:58.980 --> 00:42:02.348
没错 周二是我飞去厄基斯那克号送信的
Yeah. I flew mail out to the Erkigsnek Tuesday.


754
00:42:02.700 --> 00:42:04.907
顺便捎了他一程
Gave him a ride.


755
00:42:05.060 --> 00:42:08.223
我开直升机的时候 他拍了我的手
He took that photo of my hand on the stick.


756
00:42:09.300 --> 00:42:13.271
不敢相信 我竟然找到这大拇指的主人了
I'm just blown away I located your thumb.


757
00:42:14.940 --> 00:42:17.420
那个 其实格陵兰岛大概就七八个人
There is, like, eight people in Greenland.


758
00:42:20.140 --> 00:42:23.428
我是想说 这里比对大拇指 简单明了
I mean, it's a good place to find a thumb.


759
00:42:26.180 --> 00:42:28.786
别做对不起你女人的事情 伙计...
Don't cheat on your lady, man...


760
00:42:28.940 --> 00:42:31.944
特别是你住在一个只有八个人的地方
when you live in a country that only has eight people in it.


761
00:42:32.500 --> 00:42:33.865
就这么一说
By the way.


762
00:42:34.740 --> 00:42:35.795
所以...
So, uh...


763
00:42:35.820 --> 00:42:38.266
你也有点脾气的啊
You're scrappy.


764
00:42:40.100 --> 00:42:42.944
你是个有点脾气的小伙子
You're a little scrappy Duncan.


765
00:42:43.780 --> 00:42:45.464
所以你在找这个人?
So, you're trying to find this guy?


766
00:42:45.620 --> 00:42:47.031
是的
Yes. Yeah.


767
00:42:47.620 --> 00:42:51.067
五分钟之后 我就要送些电台零件过去
Well, I'm flying some radio parts out there in five minutes.


768
00:42:53.780 --> 00:42:56.306
他可能还在船上
He may still be on the boat.


769
00:42:56.820 --> 00:42:57.867
- 真的?  - 有可能
- Really?  - Yeah.


770
00:42:59.180 --> 00:43:01.945
你也许跟我一起走也不错
Maybe you could come with me.


771
00:43:08.460 --> 00:43:13.671
可以 也许我可以直接打他的船载电话
Yeah, or maybe I could just call him on the boat phone.


772
00:43:14.660 --> 00:43:16.264
船载电话?
The boat phone?


773
00:43:16.460 --> 00:43:18.622
嗯 船上的电话
Yeah, the phone on the boat.


774
00:43:18.780 --> 00:43:21.511
你是指联络装置?
You mean the ship-to-shore?


775
00:43:21.660 --> 00:43:25.142
是的 估计用联络装置也蛮方便的
Yeah, maybe I could just ask him on the ship-to-shore.


776
00:43:25.380 --> 00:43:27.508
他们的电台坏了
Their radio is broke.


777
00:43:27.660 --> 00:43:30.504
所以我才要飞这么一趟的
That's why I'm flying out there now.


778
00:43:30.940 --> 00:43:31.941
哦
Oh.


779
00:43:32.380 --> 00:43:34.189
你现在就准备走?
You're flying out right now?


780
00:43:34.500 --> 00:43:35.786
喝完这杯我就出发
I'm just gonna finish my beer.


781
00:43:35.980 --> 00:43:37.345
可天气看起来不怎么样啊
The weather doesn't look so great.


782
00:43:37.500 --> 00:43:38.501
的确不怎么样
It's not.


783
00:43:39.180 --> 00:43:40.620
那边的风暴看上去要飘过来的样子
Looks like there's a storm moving in.


784
00:43:42.020 --> 00:43:43.021
是啊
Yeah.


785
00:43:43.180 --> 00:43:44.386

但你刚刚...
But you're just...


788
00:43:47.500 --> 00:43:49.787
你刚刚喝过酒...
you're just gonna finish your beer...


789
00:43:49.940 --> 00:43:53.149
还能飞得稳吗?
and then fly a machine?


790
00:43:55.860 --> 00:43:57.305
也对哦
Yeah.


791
00:43:58.460 --> 00:44:00.701
风暴来了 我稍微有点紧张而已
I'm kind of nervous about the storm.


792
00:44:01.820 --> 00:44:04.824
所以就来这边喝酒压压惊
I just want to get a couple of beers down.


793
00:44:15.180 --> 00:44:16.420
好吧 那我不跟你走了

Thanks.


1096
01:07:22.260 --> 01:07:25.423
不是 "拉吉卡韦"的意思是在40个阿拉伯国家里的...
No. "Rajqawee" means "strong little man"...


1097
01:07:25.580 --> 01:07:27.901
"强壮的小矮人"
in, like, 40 Arabic countries.


1098
01:07:28.060 --> 01:07:30.984
"布兹喀什"是中非的...
And "Buzkashi" is "goat hockey"...


1099
01:07:31.140 --> 01:07:32.949
"山羊曲棍球"
in Central Asia.


1100
01:07:33.100 --> 01:07:36.104
还有"魔术师"...
And "warlocks"...


1101
01:07:36.740 --> 01:07:37.787
对
Yeah.


1102
01:07:38.580 --> 01:07:40.628
我希望它们是有联系的
I was hoping they would connect.


1103
01:07:43.740 --> 01:07:47.062
你刚才说你因为那里的杯子就离开了棒约翰?
So, you said that you left Papa John's because of the cups?


1104
01:07:47.260 --> 01:07:49.786
那我作为消费者是不是该知道些什么?
Is there something I should be aware of as a customer?


1105
01:07:50.300 --> 01:07:53.463
不是 我之前在那里干过 就这样
No, I just worked there, that's all.


1106
01:07:54.820 --> 01:07:57.141
我以前留着莫霍克头...
I used to have a mohawk...


1107
01:07:57.620 --> 01:07:59.349
背着双肩包...
and a backpack...


1108
01:08:00.140 --> 01:08:04.623
我还知道我想要成为什么 我想干什么
and this idea of who I wanted to be and what I wanted to do.


1109
01:08:06.940 --> 01:08:08.180
然后呢?
Yeah?


1110
01:08:08.340 --> 01:08:10.308
没什么 只是...
Nothing. Just...


1111
01:08:12.180 --> 01:08:14.831
那时 我和我爸关系特别好
I was pretty close with my dad.


1112
01:08:14.980 --> 01:08:19.827
他在我17岁的时候去世了 那是周二
And he died when I was 17, on a Tuesday.


1113
01:08:19.980 --> 01:08:21.948
那是我们没什么存款
And we didn't have any savings.


1114
01:08:22.500 --> 01:08:25.868
于是我在那周周四把头发剪了
So I got a haircut that Thursday...


1115
01:08:26.020 --> 01:08:29.467
在同一个周四我找了份工作
and a job the same Thursday.


1116
01:08:30.860 --> 01:08:32.191
在棒约翰?
Papa John's?


1117
01:08:32.980 --> 01:08:34.186
对
Yeah.


1118
01:08:36.940 --> 01:08:38.942
你爸允许你留莫霍克头?
Your dad let you have a mohawk?


1119
01:08:39.660 --> 01:08:41.947
他亲自给我剃的
He shaved my head.


1120
01:08:42.580 --> 01:08:44.662
真是个好爸爸
That's a good dad move.


1121
01:08:45.500 --> 01:08:46.911
对啊
Yeah.


1122
01:08:48.740 --> 01:08:50.071
冰岛美吗?
Is it nice there?


1123
01:08:50.780 --> 01:08:53.181
嗯 挺美的
Yeah, it is.


1124
01:08:53.860 --> 01:08:55.624
真的很美丽
It's really beautiful.


1125
01:08:56.060 --> 01:08:57.391
这边可一点都不美好
Well, it's pretty sucky here.


1126
01:08:57.580 --> 01:08:58.786
人力资源部已经开始
Human Resources has already started


1127
01:08:58.900 --> 01:09:00.140
裁掉一些员工了...
letting some of the staff go...


1128
01:09:00.260 --> 01:09:02.581
等你回来的时候会有很大不同
so it'll be a lot different when you get back.


1129
01:09:03.700 --> 01:09:05.702
嘿 我弄了点东西 给...
Hey, I picked something up for...


1130
01:09:08.060 --> 01:09:09.425
我想刚才信号不好
I think I lost you.


1131
01:09:11.380 --> 01:09:13.587
这样吧 回去再细聊
You know what? I'll catch up with you when I see you.


1132
01:09:14.380 --> 01:09:15.461
好啊
Great. Okay.


1133
01:09:15.620 --> 01:09:17.702
好的 没问题
All right. Okay.


1134
01:09:18.260 --> 01:09:19.386
拜拜 华特
Bye, Walter.


1135
01:09:19.540 --> 01:09:20.985
回见 谢尔
Bye, Cheryl.


1136
01:09:41.540 --> 01:09:44.795
赫南多发来短信: 十万火急 小胡子再见不到你 他就要炒我了

1137
01:10:02.780 --> 01:10:03.781
怎么了?
What's going on?


1138
01:10:05.580 --> 01:10:07.344
他们关了两层楼
They shut down two floors.


1139
01:10:07.500 --> 01:10:10.265
你怎么这么狼狈?
Why do you look rugged?


1140
01:10:12.980 --> 01:10:14.186
我看见你了
I see you.


1141
01:10:15.140 --> 01:10:16.824
又见面了!
I see you!


1142
01:10:16.980 --> 01:10:18.106
我上次说啥?
What did I say?


1143
01:10:18.260 --> 01:10:19.705
我看见你了
I see you.


1144

照片 拿出来
The photograph. Now. Let me see it.


1145
01:10:21.860 --> 01:10:24.306
我让他查了 没有什么叫银盐溶液的玩意
He looked it up. There's no such thing as a silver bath.


1146
01:10:24.940 --> 01:10:27.784
听着 底片这东西很容易出问题
Listen, there was uncertainty about the negative.


1147
01:10:27.940 --> 01:10:29.820
我明白 但底片在冰岛
I understood that, hopefully, it was in Iceland.


1148
01:10:29.940 --> 01:10:31.101
这是你的事
It was in your care.


1149
01:10:31.220 --> 01:10:32.221
你再给我点时间...
If you just give me some more time...


1150
01:10:32.380 --> 01:10:33.435
你被开除了
You're fired.


1151
01:10:33.460 --> 01:10:34.835

1156

Now I got to explain this to the board?


1157

谢尔不在 她被裁了
Cheryl's not in. She was let go.


1163
01:11:08.820 --> 01:11:10.709
很抱歉
I told you, man, it's bad.

快累死我了
after supervising moving that thing all day.

我去练练瑜伽 然后闷头睡一觉
I think I just need to go to yoga and then just crash.

01:15:12.620 --> 01:15:15.100
出出汗 把所有烦恼都忘掉
You get your sweat out, you just get everything, all your fear.

1232
01:15:25.660 --> 01:15:26.900
抛开杂念
I just get out of my head.


1233
01:15:27.060 --> 01:15:28.155
那不是挺好的?
Is that good for you?


1234
01:15:28.180 --> 01:15:30.387
我觉得报个班上上挺好的
I feel like it's good in a class like this.


1235
01:15:30.540 --> 01:15:32.144
虽然得不到什么报酬 但是无所谓
I mean, I'm not going to get paid for it, which is fine.


1236
01:15:32.300 --> 01:15:33.825
- 和钱无关  - 多好啊
- It's not about money.  - Wonderful.


1237

我觉得...
And I feel like...


1238
01:15:35.740 --> 01:15:39.711
那课是给孩子们上的 从小开始练很重要
It's just for kids, but I think it's important for them to start early.


1239
01:15:40.220 --> 01:15:41.460
我挺激动的 妈
I'm really thrilled, Mom.


1240

自己享受就行

1241
01:15:43.740 --> 01:15:45.583
站在大家面前讲话
Just standing in front of people and talking.


1242
01:15:46.100 --> 01:15:48.023

妈?
Hey. Mom?


1245
01:15:51.700 --> 01:15:52.861
怎么了
Yeah.


1246
01:15:53.500 --> 01:15:57.903

用肖恩的相机

他想了解你的行程

你什么时候走 什么时候回家

他说你真的很懂"生活"杂志的真谛

1257
01:16:26.820 --> 01:16:28.265
妈 你怎么不告诉我?
Mom, why didn't you tell me?


1258
01:16:28.460 --> 01:16:30.986
我说了啊 买菜的时候给你说的
I told you. I told you in the produce aisle.


1259
01:16:31.140 --> 01:16:32.710
我还记着呢
I remember that.


1260
01:16:34.300 --> 01:16:35.347
可能你...
Maybe you were...


1261
01:16:35.540 --> 01:16:39.226
欧黛莎 你怎么形容他走神?
Odessa, what is it you call it when he goes into one of his little places?


1262
01:16:39.420 --> 01:16:41.024
"迷糊"
"Zoned out."


1263
01:16:41.180 --> 01:16:43.103
你时不时就犯迷糊
You do that now and then.


1264
01:16:44.940 --> 01:16:46.669
怎么了?
What's the matter?


1265
01:16:48.100 --> 01:16:49.909
我被开除了
I got fired.


1266
01:16:50.460 --> 01:16:52.189
我把他的照片丢了
I lost a picture of his.


1267

能找到吗?
Can you find it?


1268
01:16:55.180 --> 01:16:57.308
找不着了 我不知道他在哪
No, I don't know where he is.


1269
01:16:57.460 --> 01:17:00.543
他去找魔法师还是什么的...
He's someplace with warlocks or...


1270

肖恩说他很快会去见军阀...
Sean said he had to meet with warlords very soon...


1274
01:17:10.460 --> 01:17:12.462
没准带着我的蛋糕
and maybe he would take my cake


1275
01:17:12.620 --> 01:17:14.622
能买通他们...
so that he could get permission...


1276
01:17:14.780 --> 01:17:17.181
好去野外拍照
to trek through the wilds and places.


1277
01:17:17.340 --> 01:17:20.184
他说他要去拍雪豹 厉害吧?

混乱的阿富汗 没错

1283
01:17:42.740 --> 01:17:44.868
在喜马拉雅山脉上
In the upper Himalayas.


1284
01:17:45.740 --> 01:17:47.504
他们不会赶你走
They can't let you go.


1285
01:17:48.500 --> 01:17:50.582
你是肖恩的搭档

他告诉我...
He told me...


1287
01:17:52.100 --> 01:17:54.580
你是最努力按他的设想...
that you were the person who worked the hardest...


1288
01:17:54.740 --> 01:17:59.189
帮他完成作品的人
to make sure his work was realized the way he wished.


1289
01:18:04.420 --> 01:18:06.104
去完成他的作品吧
You finish his work.


1290
01:18:44.420 --> 01:18:46.104
五月八日 喜马拉雅山下

1291
01:18:49.980 --> 01:18:52.275
# 天堂是你总想到达的地方 #
# Heaven is a switchboard that you want to fight #


1292
01:18:52.300 --> 01:18:54.595
# 如果你愿意帮她开阔眼界 她会想你 #
# She would even miss you if you taught her sight #


1293
01:18:54.620 --> 01:18:56.795
# 当政治家们开始右倾 #
# Power politician leaning to the right #

1294
01:18:54.620 --> 01:18:56.795
我雇了两个强壮的小男人

1295
01:18:56.820 --> 01:18:58.115
# 当孩子们有了信用基金 #
# Baby's got a trust fund #


1296
01:18:58.140 --> 01:19:01.115
# 她就会离开 #
# That she'll want to go off like that #


1297
01:19:01.140 --> 01:19:03.142
# 不再烦恼 #
# Get off of my stack #


1298
01:19:03.740 --> 01:19:05.475
# 开一扇小窗 #
# Leave a little window #


1299
01:19:05.500 --> 01:19:07.582
# 不再烦恼 #
# Get off of my stack #


1300
01:19:06.500 --> 01:19:08.582
我接受了"山之洗礼"

1301
01:19:15.820 --> 01:19:17.995
# 现在我们穿着一样的黄衣服 #
# Now we wear same-colored yellow uniforms #


1302
01:19:15.820 --> 01:19:17.995
我们用妈妈做的蛋糕贿赂了军阀

1303
01:19:18.020 --> 01:19:20.675
# 天空在燃烧 但是我们却很温暖 #
# Sky is burning but at least we know we're warm #


1304
01:19:20.700 --> 01:19:22.795
# 走遍了全世界 #
# Go and run yourself a million miles #


1305
01:19:22.820 --> 01:19:24.185
# 希望这个颜色最终会消失 #
# Hoping that the colors run out #


1306
01:19:24.300 --> 01:19:26.541
# 然后你也会像我一样
# And you go off like that #


1307
01:19:26.900 --> 01:19:28.982
# 远离烦恼 #
# Get off of my stack #


1308
01:19:32.180 --> 01:19:34.865
# 烦恼 #
# Stack #


1309
01:19:38.180 --> 01:19:38.865
身体和心灵的测试

1310
01:19:53.180 --> 01:19:54.865
海拔18000英尺

1311
01:20:00.180 --> 01:20:02.865
我的意识像雪一样在漂

1312
01:21:00.180 --> 01:21:03.865
我孤身一人

1313
01:21:04.180 --> 01:21:07.865
一个人

1314
01:21:47.300 --> 01:21:48.347
嘿 托德
Hey, Todd.


1315
01:21:48.460 --> 01:21:50.144
怎么样?
Hey, what's up?


1316
01:21:50.300 --> 01:21:51.631
还好
Not much.


1317
01:21:51.780 --> 01:21:55.421
好消息 你的档案终于完成了
Hey, good news. Your profile really rounded out, man.


1318
01:21:55.580 --> 01:21:57.344
多亏了火山鲨鱼一条龙
That volcano-shark combo.


1319
01:21:57.500 --> 01:22:00.470
简直是香饽饽 等着姑娘来找你吧
That is money in the bank. Get ready to get a lot of winks.


1320
01:22:00.620 --> 01:22:01.826
那好啊
Okay.


1321
01:22:01.980 --> 01:22:03.311
但是还有件事
But something else.


1322
01:22:03.460 --> 01:22:05.303
谢尔·梅霍夫...
Cheryl Melhoff...


1323
01:22:05.460 --> 01:22:08.031
她不在这了 注销了
she's not on here anymore. Withdrawn.


1324
01:22:08.540 --> 01:22:09.541
哦
Oh.


1325
01:22:09.700 --> 01:22:11.464
- 真的?  - 是啊
- Really?  - Yeah.


1326
01:22:11.980 --> 01:22:13.470
你现在在哪?
Hey, man, where are you now?


1327
01:22:13.620 --> 01:22:14.826
喜马拉雅
Himalayas.


1328
01:22:14.980 --> 01:22:18.143
喜马拉雅 我爱死那地方了
The Himalayas. I love it.


1329
01:22:18.340 --> 01:22:19.830
这是最厉害的"去过的地方"
That is a kick-ass "Been There."


1330
01:22:19.980 --> 01:22:21.982
托德 我得长话短说
Todd, I'm gonna keep this short.


1331
01:22:22.180 --> 01:22:23.830
氧气不够
I have to make oxygen choices.


1332
01:22:23.980 --> 01:22:26.221
我明白 冲啊!
Hey, I get it. Go!


1333
01:22:26.380 --> 01:22:29.543
你的档案完成了 恭喜你
Anyway, you have a profile now. Congratulations.


1334
01:22:29.700 --> 01:22:31.509
那不错 不过
Cool, but, you know what?


1335
01:22:31.660 --> 01:22:33.230
你能不能把它撤下来?
Would you take me off?


1336
01:22:33.380 --> 01:22:36.384
我付不起每年500的档案费
I can't really swing that $500 yearly.


1337
01:22:36.540 --> 01:22:37.826
等等
Hey.


1338
01:22:40.340 --> 01:22:41.475
哥们
Hey, man.


1339
01:22:41.500 --> 01:22:42.786
你确定吗?
You're sure? Because I feel like


1340
01:22:42.900 --> 01:22:44.180
我觉得我们才刚上道啊
we're really onto something here.


1341
01:22:44.300 --> 01:22:47.190
能小点声吗? 我在工作
Do you mind? I'm working.


1342
01:22:47.340 --> 01:22:49.342
这可是我弄过最棒的档案
This is one of the best profiles I've ever done.


1343
01:22:49.540 --> 01:22:51.460
关于退款的政策 我们这还没有...
And our refund policy, well, we don't have one...


1344
01:22:51.500 --> 01:22:53.309
托德 我得挂了
Todd, I got to go.


1345
01:22:55.220 --> 01:22:56.221
肖恩
Sean.


1346
01:22:57.140 --> 01:22:58.221
是我
Yeah.


1347
01:23:04.980 --> 01:23:07.028
我是华特
It's Walter.


1348
01:23:10.660 --> 01:23:12.389
米蒂
Mitty.


1349
01:23:21.380 --> 01:23:22.381
华特·米蒂
Walter Mitty.


1350
01:23:23.260 --> 01:23:24.910
真的?
Seriously?


1351
01:23:27.020 --> 01:23:29.227
你怎么上来的?
How the hell did you get up here?


1352
01:23:30.060 --> 01:23:31.585
我...
I just...


1353
01:23:35.220 --> 01:23:36.949
我一直在找你
I've been looking for you.


1354
01:23:39.940 --> 01:23:41.544
先坐下
Sit down.


1355
01:23:48.380 --> 01:23:49.745
我坐
I'll sit.


1356
01:23:57.740 --> 01:23:59.583
慢慢来 缓和下来
Well, take your time. Settle in.


1357
01:23:59.740 --> 01:24:01.583
保持安静 好吗?
Try to be real still, okay?


1358
01:24:04.060 --> 01:24:05.630
那有只雪豹
There's a snow leopard.


1359
01:24:06.780 --> 01:24:09.306
就在山脊里
Right in this ridge.


1360
01:24:10.140 --> 01:24:13.826
所以我们得非常非常非常安静
So we have to try to be very, very, very, very still.


1361
01:24:16.940 --> 01:24:19.466
大家管雪豹叫"幽灵猫"
They call the snow leopard the "ghost cat."


1362
01:24:21.460 --> 01:24:23.747
它们神出鬼没
It never lets itself be seen.


1363
01:24:28.500 --> 01:24:30.502
幽灵猫?
Ghost cat?


1364
01:24:33.740 --> 01:24:37.301
美好的东西从来不会寻求关注
Beautiful things don't ask for attention.


1365
01:24:42.860 --> 01:24:48.105
肖恩 你给我的底片有一张不见了
Sean, there was a negative that got separated from your roll.


1366
01:24:50.180 --> 01:24:53.150
为这事我被批了个狗血淋头
I'm taking a lot of heat over it at work.


1367
01:24:53.300 --> 01:24:57.146
那张底片没有寄来
It never came with the roll that you sent.


1368
01:24:57.300 --> 01:24:59.143
你说最后一卷?
The last roll you're talking about?


1369
01:24:59.300 --> 01:25:00.461
没错
Yeah.


1370
01:25:00.580 --> 01:25:01.661
25号
The 25.


1371
01:25:03.100 --> 01:25:04.784
没错
Yeah.


1372
01:25:05.980 --> 01:25:07.948
你就坐在它上边
You're sitting on it.


1373
01:25:10.980 --> 01:25:12.869
为什么这么说?
Why am I sitting on it?


1374
01:25:14.300 --> 01:25:16.189
就在你钱包里
It's in your wallet.


1375
01:25:17.020 --> 01:25:19.068
那是个礼物
That was the gift.


1376
01:25:19.220 --> 01:25:20.984
照片是个礼物
The photograph.


1377
01:25:21.140 --> 01:25:23.029
钱包只是我用来装底片的
The wallet was just something I could put it in.


1378
01:25:23.180 --> 01:25:26.627
我把底片放在了钱包的照片夹里
So, I put it in a little slot, the little picture holder in there.


1379
01:25:26.820 --> 01:25:28.470
我觉得挺有意思的
I thought it would be cute.


1380
01:25:31.060 --> 01:25:32.903
我告诉过你啊"往里看"
I told you, "look inside."


1381
01:25:33.580 --> 01:25:35.184
纸条上写了
In the note.


1382
01:25:35.460 --> 01:25:36.666
你说"往里看"
You said "look inside."


1383
01:25:36.820 --> 01:25:40.029
我以为你说的是往包装纸里看
I thought you meant look inside of the wrapping paper.


1384
01:25:40.580 --> 01:25:43.186
是吗? 多棒的惊喜啊
Yeah? Well, you got a real nice surprise coming.


1385
01:25:43.380 --> 01:25:45.542
不 没了
No, I don't have it.


1386
01:25:45.700 --> 01:25:47.675
已经没了
I don't have it anymore.


1387
01:25:47.700 --> 01:25:48.701
哇哦!
Whoa!


1388
01:25:54.580 --> 01:25:56.548
你在想什么啊?
What the hell were you thinking?


1389
01:25:58.820 --> 01:26:01.744
不好意思 我仰慕你这么久
I mean, I'm sorry, I've admired you for a very long time...


1390
01:26:01.940 --> 01:26:05.581
但是这真是太坑人了 那底片太珍贵了
but that is not a good move, at all, with a valuable negative.


1391
01:26:05.740 --> 01:26:07.708
对不起 我...
Sorry, I just...


1392
01:26:07.900 --> 01:26:10.426
我觉得这么挺好玩的
I thought it would be a playful kind of thing.


1393
01:26:10.580 --> 01:26:12.070
好玩?
Playful?


1394
01:26:13.260 --> 01:26:14.864
真好玩
Too playful.


1395
01:26:16.220 --> 01:26:17.585
我明白你的意思
I see what you're saying.


1396
01:26:17.740 --> 01:26:20.391
当封面的图 我应该直接给你
With the cover, I should have been more straightforward.


1397
01:26:20.580 --> 01:26:23.629
你要是不介意 我想问问你...
But can I ask you, I mean, if you don't mind...


1398
01:26:24.580 --> 01:26:26.389
钱包怎么了?
what did you do with the wallet?


1399
01:26:27.420 --> 01:26:28.865
扔了
Chucked it.


1400
01:26:31.220 --> 01:26:33.348
真伤心
Well, that hurts my feelings.


1401
01:26:34.580 --> 01:26:36.582
不 我很喜欢
No. Man, I liked it very much.


1402
01:26:36.740 --> 01:26:38.105
非常喜欢
I appreciated it very much.


1403
01:26:38.260 --> 01:26:39.261
所以你就把他扔了?
So you threw it away?


1404
01:26:43.580 --> 01:26:46.504
你不知道那是什么?
So, you have no idea what it was?


1405
01:26:47.580 --> 01:26:48.581
那张照片?
The photograph?


1406
01:26:52.420 --> 01:26:53.785
真可惜
It's a shame.


1407
01:26:56.260 --> 01:26:58.103
那张真的很美
It was a beauty.


1408
01:27:14.700 --> 01:27:17.101
话说回来 你怎么找到我的?
How did you find me, anyway?


1409
01:27:19.620 --> 01:27:20.860
靠我妈妈
My mom.


1410
01:27:21.740 --> 01:27:24.983
她是个好人 蛋糕烤得很棒
Cool lady. Knows how to bake.


1411
01:27:25.380 --> 01:27:26.905
是啊
Yeah.


1412
01:27:29.540 --> 01:27:30.826
- 你为什么...  - 嘘!
- Hey, why did you...  - Shh!


1413
01:28:07.060 --> 01:28:09.586
你准备什么时候拍?
When are you gonna take it?


1414
01:28:13.660 --> 01:28:15.583
有时候我不拍
Sometimes I don't.


1415
01:28:16.460 --> 01:28:18.269
如果我很喜欢某个瞬间...
If I like a moment...


1416
01:28:18.900 --> 01:28:22.586
我是说 就我个人而言...
I mean, me, personally...


1417
01:28:24.540 --> 01:28:27.703
我不喜欢为了拍照而拍照
I don't like to have the distraction of the camera.


1418
01:28:31.180 --> 01:28:35.026
只想享受在那一刻
Just want to stay in it.


1419
01:28:38.540 --> 01:28:40.224
享受在那一刻?
Stay in it?


1420
01:28:41.700 --> 01:28:43.384
嗯 那一刻
Yeah, right there.


1421
01:28:44.540 --> 01:28:46.383
就像这一刻
Right here.


1422
01:28:49.700 --> 01:28:51.543
现在它不见了 跑掉了
Now it's gone. It's gone.


1423
01:28:58.140 --> 01:28:59.585
看起来很好玩
That looks like fun.


1424
01:28:59.940 --> 01:29:01.908
我要加入
I think I'm gonna jump in.


1425
01:29:03.020 --> 01:29:05.387
嘿 那张照片是什么 肖恩?
Hey, what was the picture, Sean?


1426
01:29:06.260 --> 01:29:09.423

那照片是什么?
What was the picture?


1428
01:29:14.060 --> 01:29:17.781
让我们称之为鬼猫吧 华特·米蒂
Let's just call it a ghost cat, Walter Mitty.


1429
01:29:25.340 --> 01:29:27.627
# 你手握何物 #
# What's in your hand


1430
01:29:28.740 --> 01:29:31.983
# 你被囚制于常规之中 #
# You're pinned down to routines #


1431
01:29:35.580 --> 01:29:38.186
# 情绪时而高涨时而低落 #
# Elevate and leave #


1432
01:29:38.940 --> 01:29:41.341
# 闪烁的屏幕之上 #

1433
01:29:45.580 --> 01:29:48.789
# 一切尽在坚持之中 #

1434
01:29:49.660 --> 01:29:51.901
# 一切常在 #
# Nothing is lost #


1435
01:29:55.900 --> 01:29:58.983
# 当一切处于意识之内 #

1436
01:30:00.260 --> 01:30:02.342
# 一切顺利 #
# Nothing is crossed #


1437
01:31:04.940 --> 01:31:06.704
你在监视名单上
You made the watch list.


1438
01:31:06.860 --> 01:31:09.635
你是怎么避过旅行禁令 到阿富汗的?
How did you get to Afghanistan? There's a travel ban.


1439
01:31:10.780 --> 01:31:12.305
从也门过去
Through Yemen.


1440

暴力之都
Violent place.


1441
01:31:16.460 --> 01:31:18.747
这就是为什么飞机票只要84美元
That's why the air fare is only $84.


1442
01:31:19.820 --> 01:31:21.743
我可以要回我的横笛吗?
Can I have my fife back?


1443
01:31:23.780 --> 01:31:25.623
你在洛杉矶认识什么人吗?

或者任何可以证明你是华特·米蒂的人?
Anybody here who might be able to verify that you're Walter Mitty?


1447

1458
01:32:03.460 --> 01:32:05.986

肉桂卷呀!
Cinnabon!


1460
01:32:09.780 --> 01:32:11.862
顺便问一句 你被拘留了多久?
How long were you detained for, by the way?


1461
01:32:13.260 --> 01:32:14.910
貌似有17个小时
Like, 17 hours.


1462
01:32:15.300 --> 01:32:17.587
哇哦! 肉桂卷味道怎么样?

Really great.


1464
01:32:18.980 --> 01:32:21.790
我的朋友 你现在吃的是糖霜海洛因
That's frosted heroin. That's what you're eating, my friend.


1465

这就是你在这所拥有的
That's what you're having right there, man.


1466
01:32:24.740 --> 01:32:25.755
顺便提一下...
By the way...


1467
01:32:25.780 --> 01:32:29.546
在我撤下你的资料之前你得到了300个示好
you got 300 winks before I took down your profile.

在两小时之内 太疯狂了
In the space of two hours. It was crazy.

我还以为我在卖音乐会门票呢
I thought I was selling concert tickets.


1470

谢尔 从来没有回应过别人的示好...
Cheryl, who did not respond to a single wink...


1476
01:32:50.940 --> 01:32:52.305
她一直都在那

是个挑三拣四的女士

进行得怎么样了?
daydreaming going?


1481
01:33:06.620 --> 01:33:07.985
最近比较少
Lately, less.


1482
01:33:09.820 --> 01:33:10.981
不错
Good.

对 你欠我的

1486
01:33:16.820 --> 01:33:19.187
我钢琴一卖掉 我就把支票寄给你

你盘子里有很多
You have a lot on your plate.


1488
01:33:23.260 --> 01:33:25.183
你现在要做什么呢?
What are you gonna do now?


1489
01:33:26.340 --> 01:33:28.104
出去然后再找份工作
Go out and get another job.


1490
01:33:32.340 --> 01:33:33.341
干杯!
Boom!


1491
01:33:35.660 --> 01:33:37.185
对不起 华特 我只是...
Sorry, Walter, I just...


1492
01:33:37.340 --> 01:33:38.355
什么?
What?


1493
01:33:38.380 --> 01:33:40.189
你和我想象的完全不一样
You are so not how I pictured you.


1494
01:33:41.300 --> 01:33:42.790
你是怎么想象我的?
How did you picture me?


1495
01:33:42.980 --> 01:33:45.426
我想你是一个灰暗的家伙
I pictured you as a little gray piece of paper.


1496
01:33:46.100 --> 01:33:47.511
但现在我看到你...
But now I see you...


1497
01:33:47.660 --> 01:33:49.788
有点像印第安纳·琼斯...
and it's like Indiana Jones...


1498
01:33:49.940 --> 01:33:51.226
决定成为摇滚乐队的主唱
decided to become the lead singer


1499
01:33:51.340 --> 01:33:52.820
或者其他类似的
of The Strokes or something like that.


1500
01:33:52.860 --> 01:33:54.669
- 太疯狂了  - 我知道
- It's nuts.  - I know.


1501
01:34:15.140 --> 01:34:16.471
对不起 妈妈
Sorry, Mom.


1502
01:34:16.620 --> 01:34:17.781
为什么要说对不起?
What for?


1503
01:34:18.860 --> 01:34:20.988
这是爸爸买给你的 这是我的责任
Dad bought it for you. It was my responsibility.


1504
01:34:21.700 --> 01:34:22.906

我想让你知道...
Hey, I wanted you to know...


1577
01:41:04.860 --> 01:41:06.464
你没有让我无聊
you weren't boring me.


1578
01:41:07.340 --> 01:41:08.865
那天在公园里
That day in the park.


1579
01:41:10.340 --> 01:41:11.546
我...
I was...


1580
01:41:12.940 --> 01:41:13.941
我当时在想...
I was thinking about...


1581
01:41:14.140 --> 01:41:18.304
我希望这听起来没有很怪异 但那时我是在想你
I hope this doesn't sound weird, but I was thinking about you.


1582
01:41:20.220 --> 01:41:23.702
当时我正在格陵兰 他们在那里唱卡拉OK...
When I was in Greenland, they do karaoke there...


1583
01:41:24.380 --> 01:41:29.466
而我不得不坐上一架直升机 和一个喝得醉醺醺的飞行员
and I had to get on this helicopter, with a very drunk pilot.


1584
01:41:30.340 --> 01:41:32.991
然后我开始想象你...
And I started to imagine you...


1585
01:41:33.660 --> 01:41:35.708
唱着"汤姆上校"那首歌
singing Major Tom.


1586
01:41:38.500 --> 01:41:40.150
不管怎样...
Anyway...


1587
01:41:41.060 --> 01:41:43.222
它让我上了直升机
it got me on the helicopter.


1588
01:41:43.420 --> 01:41:47.505
并且把我带到了我想去的地方
And it got me where I wanted to go.


1589
01:41:50.020 --> 01:41:51.021
所以 你发生了什么?
So, what happened to you?


1590
01:41:51.220 --> 01:41:54.429
你似乎失踪了
You sort of fell off the face of the Earth there.


1591
01:41:54.580 --> 01:41:56.025
一会会儿
For a little bit.


1592
01:41:56.660 --> 01:41:58.822
我路过你家然后...
I came by and...


1593
01:41:59.020 --> 01:42:01.830
你的丈夫开门了 所以我想我还是走吧
your husband answered so I figured I should just go.


1594
01:42:03.220 --> 01:42:06.542
是菲尔 他当时在修理我的冰箱
Phil. He was fixing my refrigerator.


1595
01:42:06.700 --> 01:42:08.509
而且他不是我的丈夫
And he's not my husband.


1596
01:42:09.900 --> 01:42:11.868
看起来像我想象的...
I guess I imagined...


1597
01:42:13.740 --> 01:42:16.027
我以为也许你们又重修旧好了
I thought maybe you got back together.


1598
01:42:16.740 --> 01:42:18.868
你想象力真丰富
You have a good imagination.


1599
01:42:19.020 --> 01:42:20.545
但是没有
But no.

1603

你想和我一起去看吗?
Do you want to go with me?


1604
01:42:35.140 --> 01:42:36.744
我知道这听起来并不是很好
I made that sound really not good.


1605
01:42:36.900 --> 01:42:38.106
好啊
Yeah.


1606

Grease in a weird church? Are you kidding?


1609
01:42:46.740 --> 01:42:48.902
里佐 那是最好的部分
Rizzo, that's the best part.


1610
01:42:49.220 --> 01:42:52.144

- Oh, yeah?  - Yeah.


1618
01:43:07.580 --> 01:43:10.663
因为抽烟还是青少年性行为?
Was it the smoking and the teenage sex?


1619
01:43:10.820 --> 01:43:13.744
不 我觉得她很真实
No. She was just real, I guess.


1620
01:43:13.900 --> 01:43:14.901

# Well, the way I feel is the way I write #


1645
01:46:17.820 --> 01:46:21.381
# 如说谎之人的泉思如涌 #
# Racin' like the thoughts of the man who lies #


1646
01:46:23.300 --> 01:46:26.543

# There's a rhythm in rush these days #


1660
01:48:15.540 --> 01:48:19.431
# 生活一成不变 但是也没有因此失色 #
# Where the lines don't move and the colors don't fade #


1661
01:48:22.380 --> 01:48:25.862

1696
01:53:13.500 --> 01:53:15.980
# 就像我最喜欢的歌曲唱片 #
# Like a worn-out recording #


1697
01:53:17.260 --> 01:53:19.069
# 最终变得磨损 #
# Of my favorite song #


1698
01:53:20.540 --> 01:53:22.986
# 所以当她睡在那里 #
# So while she lay there sleepin' #


1699
01:53:24.140 --> 01:53:26.063
# 我在床头读着杂志 #

# 如果你喜欢鸡尾酒 #
# If you like piña coladas #


1703
01:53:38.420 --> 01:53:40.468
# 或者喜欢雨点的洗礼 #
# Or getting caught in the rain #


1704
01:53:42.180 --> 01:53:44.581
# 海洋的抚摸 #
# And the feel of the ocean #


1705
01:53:45.700 --> 01:53:47.862
# 香槟的味道
# And the taste of champagne #


1706
01:53:49.020 --> 01:53:51.421
# 如果你喜欢在午夜做爱 #
# If you like making love at midnight #


1707
01:53:52.700 --> 01:53:54.862
# 在海角的沙丘里 #
# In the dunes of the cape #


1708
01:53:56.100 --> 01:53:58.831
# 那么你就是我一直寻找的人 #
# Then you're the lady that I look for #


1709
01:53:59.900 --> 01:54:01.982
# 和我走吧 一起逃离 #
# Come with me and escape #
