00:07:56.625 --> 00:07:57.827
Uh-uh. [DOOR CLOSES]

154
00:07:57.860 --> 00:07:59.396
- ELI: Wait a second.
- HARPER: We just thought...


155
00:08:01.130 --> 00:08:02.798
That went really well.

156
00:08:02.832 --> 00:08:04.867
MEGHAN: Okay.
So, not excited to see us.


157
00:08:04.899 --> 00:08:06.702
No, she'll come around.
She will be.


158
00:08:06.736 --> 00:08:09.438
- BECCA: Shit.
- It's fine. We'll just give her time.


159
00:08:09.471 --> 00:08:10.906
Just sit her down tonight.

160
00:08:10.940 --> 00:08:13.076
We can't sit her down if we can't
get her to stay in a room with us.


161
00:08:13.108 --> 00:08:15.178
Wait. "Sit her down"?
Am I missing something?


162
00:08:15.211 --> 00:08:16.980
Eli is concerned about Sam.

163
00:08:17.012 --> 00:08:20.149
- About how much she's drinking and how she's handling things.
- BECCA: Sam. Sam?


164
00:08:20.182 --> 00:08:22.018
'Cause how she's
handling things isn't working.


165
00:08:22.050 --> 00:08:24.152
- MEGHAN: Oh, my God. You guys...
- Sam?


166
00:08:24.185 --> 00:08:26.822
AARON: Yo, I didn't know this
was gonna be a whole "thing."


167
00:08:26.856 --> 00:08:28.825
Then why did you come, dude?
Why are you here?


168
00:08:28.858 --> 00:08:30.393
- AARON: Easy, man.
- No, I wanna know.


169
00:08:30.425 --> 00:08:33.396
Well, first of all, you said she
was gonna be excited to see us.


170
00:08:33.429 --> 00:08:35.631
And besides, we wanna
be here for our friend.


171
00:08:35.664 --> 00:08:38.868
And you obviously weren't not gonna
do this, so we weren't not gonna come.


172
00:08:38.901 --> 00:08:40.603
- Yeah.
- [KNOCKING AT DOOR]


173

Oh. Hi.

174
00:08:48.810 --> 00:08:51.079
- Hi.
- Who's that?


175
00:08:51.113 --> 00:08:52.982
Maybe I have the wrong...
Is Sam here?


176
00:08:53.015 --> 00:08:54.684
- You're looking for Sam?
- Fascinating.


177
00:08:54.717 --> 00:08:55.852
So far, yes. I'm Ruthy.

178
00:08:55.884 --> 00:08:57.419
- Are you sure?
- Doesn't sound sure.


179
00:08:57.453 --> 00:08:59.222
- AARON: Ruthy?
- Short for Rutherford.


180
00:08:59.254 --> 00:09:01.823
- Oh! Duh.
- My mother's favorite president.


181
00:09:01.857 --> 00:09:03.726
BECCA: Shouldn't
that be "Ruh-thy?"


182
00:09:03.758 --> 00:09:05.228
Oh, you're Becca.

183
00:09:05.261 --> 00:09:07.430
- Am I famous?
- No, sorry, you're Sam's sister, right?


184
00:09:07.463 --> 00:09:08.831
- Yeah.
- Who are you?


185
00:09:08.863 --> 00:09:12.267
I live next to Sam. Is she...
We had plans to avoid Thanksgiving.


186
00:09:12.300 --> 00:09:13.268
Fascinating!

187
00:09:13.301 --> 00:09:15.437
Sorry, we're so rude.
Come in, please.


188
00:09:15.470 --> 00:09:17.305
Come in. I'm Harper.

189

Ah.

This is Eli, Meghan,
and Becca.


191
00:09:20.608 --> 00:09:24.913
I wasn't expecting other people.
If you want, I can go somewhere.


192
00:09:24.946 --> 00:09:28.784
Don't be silly, no. Let me take this
upstairs. And Eli, can you take his coat?


193
00:09:28.818 --> 00:09:31.754
- Yeah, sure.
- Thank you.


194
00:09:31.786 --> 00:09:33.288
Brave of you to stay.

195
00:09:33.321 --> 00:09:35.390
Brave of you to straighten
your hair in this weather.


196
00:09:35.424 --> 00:09:37.794
- Oh, my God. You suck.
- Thank you.


197
00:09:37.826 --> 00:09:39.961
Can we focus, please?

198
00:09:39.994 --> 00:09:44.099
Ruthy, I'm sorry to say, you, uh, walked
into a little bit of family business.


199
00:09:44.132 --> 00:09:46.002
So we're just
in the middle of something here.


200
00:09:46.035 --> 00:09:50.173
I think maybe some of us actually might be
on a different page about what is happening,


201
00:09:50.205 --> 00:09:52.874
so if we can just re-center
and move forward


202
00:09:52.907 --> 00:09:54.643
with the intention
of being here for Sam.


203
00:09:54.676 --> 00:09:57.913
I am with the intention of eating these
eggs before they get cold, please.


204
00:09:57.946 --> 00:09:59.748
Ruthy, I brought you
some right here.


205
00:09:59.781 --> 00:10:02.951
BECCA: They're right. We need to
wait it out. ELI: Wait what out?


206
00:10:02.984 --> 00:10:04.753
MEGHAN: She's
not delighted to see us.


207
00:10:04.786 --> 00:10:05.921
ELI: She didn't know
you were coming.


208
00:10:05.954 --> 00:10:07.456
She's happy we're here, guys.

209

Oh, you have the emotional
capacity of a raisin.


210
00:10:09.325 --> 00:10:11.194
- I've heard that, thanks.
- RUTHY: Oh, my God.


211
00:10:11.227 --> 00:10:15.231
Lookay, we're all here now and it's crucial
that we're a united front about this.


212
00:10:15.263 --> 00:10:16.599
A united front about what?

213
00:10:16.632 --> 00:10:18.767
- What is happening?
- What is it? What is this about?


214
00:10:20.169 --> 00:10:21.737
She's dropping the charges.

215
00:10:21.770 --> 00:10:25.341
- What? Why didn't you tell me that?
- Oh, my God.


216
00:10:25.373 --> 00:10:26.942
This is why
you moved Friendsgiving.


217
00:10:26.975 --> 00:10:29.678
Listen, we need to work together
here to make sure that Sam


218
00:10:29.711 --> 00:10:32.180
doesn't make a decision
that she cannot undo.


219
00:10:32.214 --> 00:10:33.983
Once it's over, it's over.

220

[SHUSHES] Keep your voice down, man.
She's right in there.


221
00:10:36.118 --> 00:10:37.887
BECCA: She
cannot drop the charges.


222
00:10:37.920 --> 00:10:39.088
If she doesn't go,

223
00:10:39.121 --> 00:10:40.690
it's filed
as a false accusation.


224
00:10:40.723 --> 00:10:41.958
Gets counted as she's lying.

225
00:10:41.991 --> 00:10:43.626
Lookay, she just needs
to put that fucker away.


226
00:10:43.658 --> 00:10:45.427
- She just needs to let the justice system do its...
- Fuck the justice system.


227
00:10:45.460 --> 00:10:47.363
She needs to stop this guy from
doing this to another woman.


228
00:10:47.396 --> 00:10:49.232
Maybe that's not
what she wants.


229
00:10:49.265 --> 00:10:52.201
Of course it's what she wants. I'm not
saying that she knows it's what she wants,


230
00:10:52.233 --> 00:10:53.835
but it's what she wants.

231

- Eli...
- I love when men tell women what they want. It's the best.

Okay, you know what I mean.

233
00:10:57.439 --> 00:10:59.242
Lookay, we have
a better chance of this working


234
00:10:59.275 --> 00:11:01.711
if we do it on her terms.

235
00:11:01.743 --> 00:11:04.247
Gain her trust,
establish therapeutical ends.

My least favorite
version of you.

- Psych school dropout.
- Mmm.


238
00:11:07.616 --> 00:11:10.752
Has anybody actually talked to
Sam about this? Like, at all?


239
00:11:10.786 --> 00:11:12.854
I was just about to say that
one of us should go talk to her.


240
00:11:12.887 --> 00:11:15.557
- And it really ought to be me.
- [SCOFFS] Absolutely not. It's me.


241
00:11:15.590 --> 00:11:17.259
"Me or you," I said.

242
00:11:17.292 --> 00:11:19.094
- I said, "Or you."
- Okay.


243
00:11:20.094 --> 00:11:22.130
Wait a second. Why not me?

244
00:11:22.164 --> 00:11:23.900

your job right now,


245
00:11:23.932 --> 00:11:28.570
in this space, and quite frankly the
world, is to be quiet and to listen.

Um...

247
00:11:30.104 --> 00:11:31.373
She just doesn't need to hear from a
straight white dude right now, okay?


248
00:11:31.406 --> 00:11:32.974
Just because he's...
Not all men are...


249
00:11:33.007 --> 00:11:34.343
Did you really just
"Not all men" me?


250
00:11:34.376 --> 00:11:36.946
Don't fucking lump me
into some category, Bec.


251

That's so
unbelievably reductive.

- This is not about your politics.
- Okay.


253
00:11:40.215 --> 00:11:41.550
And technically,
I'm not white-white, okay?

[MOCK VOMITS] Shit.

Oh, it's your Jew card.
You dropped it.

[HARPER, AARON
AND MEGHAN CHUCKLING]

All right.

260
00:11:54.530 --> 00:11:56.464
Um, I know
you weren't expecting me,


261
00:11:56.498 --> 00:11:59.569
and I just arrived at this
whatever you're calling this,


262
00:11:59.602 --> 00:12:02.004
and I hardly know
any of you, like, at all.


263
00:12:02.036 --> 00:12:04.406
But what I do know
is that Sam is in there,


264
00:12:04.440 --> 00:12:08.945
and if the coffee is out here,
she'll come out eventually.


265
00:12:08.978 --> 00:12:12.013
So let's just
give her some space.

Give it up, man.

I want to check
my Fantasy scores.

You know what
this place needs?


271
00:12:37.605 --> 00:12:39.674
A little
Christmas spirit, yeah?


272
00:12:39.708 --> 00:12:40.576
It's still Thanksgiving.

273
00:12:40.608 --> 00:12:42.612
Yeah, yeah,
but Sam loves Christmas.


274
00:12:42.645 --> 00:12:45.114
I mean, it's late November.
It's practically December.


275
00:12:45.147 --> 00:12:46.415
And I think Bec would agree

276
00:12:46.448 --> 00:12:47.583
that celebrating
Thanksgiving this year


277
00:12:47.616 --> 00:12:49.118
is a little controversial
anyway, right?


278
00:12:49.151 --> 00:12:51.887
Well, I mean, it's not just this
year that it's controversial.


279
00:12:51.920 --> 00:12:56.125
But sure, maybe let's skip the holiday
that glorifies genocide and rape.

- It's fine.

- A bat?
- A real bat? I wanna see.

- No, just sit down.
- No.


287

I will continue to reach out
to animal control.

Right, okay. Well, I officially demand
Christmas festivity, starting with a tree.

Even if we're
against Thanksgiving,

we don't have to be
against mashed potatoes.

Yeah, so whatever holiday it is,
we should make... pie.

- AARON: Booze.

00:13:38.633 --> 00:13:41.469
Boys, you ready to George
Washington this bitch?


300
00:13:41.502 --> 00:13:44.239
Um, the whole point of the
story is that he didn't.


301
00:13:44.272 --> 00:13:45.807
He didn't
chop down a cherry tree.


302
00:13:45.840 --> 00:13:48.576
Well, Rutherford,
you're the expert on presidents, not me.


303
00:13:48.609 --> 00:13:49.978
Wait, I'm sorry,
what is happening?


304
00:13:50.012 --> 00:13:51.414
What are these gendered
activities right now? [SCOFFS]


305
00:13:51.446 --> 00:13:52.947
[MEGHAN AND HARPER] Ugh.

306
00:13:52.980 --> 00:13:55.216
Okay, whatever.

307
00:13:55.249 --> 00:13:58.119
I'm gonna stay back
and see if she emerges.


308
00:13:58.152 --> 00:13:59.622
Fine, whatever.

309
00:13:59.655 --> 00:14:01.457
Hey, you ready to roll up your sleeves
and chop yourself a tree, Ruthy?


310
00:14:01.489 --> 00:14:04.459
Oh, my God. I'm in a porn.

311
00:14:05.060 --> 00:14:06.963
I'm in a hetero porn.

312
00:14:14.969 --> 00:14:18.773
Now it's just this scramble
to get everything together.


313
00:14:18.806 --> 00:14:21.109
- [LAUGHS] I'm sure you're doing all of it.
- Of course.


314
00:14:21.142 --> 00:14:22.877
So fucking typical of him.

315
00:14:22.911 --> 00:14:26.214
- Know that that doesn't change once you get married.
- Ugh.


316
00:14:26.248 --> 00:14:27.416
But you'll see it'll work.

317
00:14:27.449 --> 00:14:28.950
MEGHAN: He's good
at so many other things.


318
00:14:28.983 --> 00:14:30.252
Any preferences?

319
00:14:30.285 --> 00:14:34.323
Oh. Um, no.
I'm not, uh...


320
00:14:34.355 --> 00:14:35.457
I'm not drinking.

321
00:14:35.491 --> 00:14:37.326
Oh, my God.
Are you pregnant?


322
00:14:37.358 --> 00:14:40.796
What? No. God, no.

323
00:14:40.829 --> 00:14:43.065
Then why? Since when?

324
00:14:43.098 --> 00:14:48.002
Uh, since just
after the, um...


325
00:14:48.036 --> 00:14:53.642
[CLICKS TONGUE] Just after. My therapist
suggested it would be good for my anxiety.


326
00:14:53.675 --> 00:14:56.245
Oh, wow.
So you're like totally sober?


327
00:14:56.277 --> 00:14:58.513
- Yeah.
- [CHUCKLES SOFTLY]


328
00:14:58.546 --> 00:15:00.815
Your wedding's gonna suck.

329
00:15:00.849 --> 00:15:02.818
[SCOFFS]

330
00:15:02.850 --> 00:15:05.453
RUTHY: I remember reading in elementary
school that they eat mosquitoes.


331
00:15:05.487 --> 00:15:08.557
So we just need to find,
like, a thousand mosquitoes.


332
00:15:08.589 --> 00:15:10.759
And I remember
they eat fruit, too.


333
00:15:10.792 --> 00:15:13.796
[CHUCKLES] Why are we
feeding the bat again?


334
00:15:13.829 --> 00:15:16.933
'Cause the ladies don't want
the bat to starve and die.


335
00:15:19.535 --> 00:15:22.004
Hey, she mention
any other details to Meghan?


336
00:15:22.637 --> 00:15:24.572
Who?

337
00:15:24.605 --> 00:15:28.877
Sam. Has Sam mentioned anything
else about that night to her?


338
00:15:28.911 --> 00:15:30.579
Oh. We don't really...

339
00:15:30.612 --> 00:15:33.616
'Cause I figured, you know, Meghan might
know why she fucking bailed on this thing.


340
00:15:33.648 --> 00:15:35.884
- Um...
- Maybe it had something to do with the drug test.


341
00:15:35.917 --> 00:15:39.020
- I know she's been waiting on those results for...
- Test came back negative.


342
00:15:40.022 --> 00:15:41.456
What?

343
00:15:41.489 --> 00:15:43.558
- How would you know?
- They mentioned them at the hearing.


344
00:15:43.592 --> 00:15:45.695
- His lawyer's, like, obsessive.
- Wait. Wait a second.


345
00:15:46.594 --> 00:15:48.564
You've been to the hearings?

346
00:15:49.230 --> 00:15:50.999
No.

347
00:15:51.032 --> 00:15:55.003
[SCOFFS] She said that no one was allowed.
Motherfucker. God damn it.


348
00:15:56.438 --> 00:15:58.307
I don't know.

349
00:15:58.339 --> 00:16:02.578
I mean, it happened
at our engagement party.


350
00:16:02.610 --> 00:16:06.414
I was so drunk, I didn't even
notice when she disappeared.


351
00:16:06.448 --> 00:16:08.117
- It's our fault that it...
- No, it's not.


352
00:16:08.150 --> 00:16:11.320
- No, it's not your burden all the time.
- No, I know it's not our fault.


353
00:16:11.353 --> 00:16:13.354
- I just...
- Meghan, none of us noticed.


354
00:16:13.387 --> 00:16:15.391
We were all plastered.

355
00:16:17.358 --> 00:16:21.796
And Aaron won't talk about it.
Like, at all.


356
00:16:21.829 --> 00:16:23.232
He can't. He says

357
00:16:23.265 --> 00:16:25.734
he can't think about it happening
to his friend, so he just doesn't.


358
00:16:25.767 --> 00:16:28.036
The male ability
to compartmentalize?


359
00:16:28.070 --> 00:16:30.473
MEGHAN: [HUFFS] I know.

360
00:16:30.506 --> 00:16:32.541
But I can't...
I can't expect him to.


361
00:16:33.709 --> 00:16:37.279
Aaron wasn't there that night
at the hospital with Sam.


362
00:16:37.311 --> 00:16:39.882
It was... intense.

363
00:16:43.252 --> 00:16:46.589
He won't even acknowledge
that it happened.


364
00:16:46.622 --> 00:16:50.993
Yeah, I just need him to say
that it happened.


365
00:16:51.026 --> 00:16:56.531
And now we have this expensive
venue, and this date, and I just...


366
00:16:56.565 --> 00:16:58.733
Have you guys been
to counseling?


367
00:16:58.767 --> 00:17:02.771
[CHUCKLES] We're in a
thruple with our therapist.


368
00:17:02.804 --> 00:17:05.007
- God.
- Yeah.


369
00:17:05.039 --> 00:17:09.377
How's Eli with all of this?
How are you guys?


370
00:17:09.411 --> 00:17:12.113
He's good.
We're... We're fine.


371
00:17:18.053 --> 00:17:20.456
She's so...
good at lying.


372
00:17:20.488 --> 00:17:22.924
Whatever, maybe I can talk to her lawyer.
We can fucking figure...


373
00:17:22.958 --> 00:17:24.159
Maybe just talk to her.

374
00:17:24.191 --> 00:17:25.460
I have, dude.

375
00:17:25.494 --> 00:17:27.363
My mother has.

376
00:17:27.395 --> 00:17:31.065
We ask her to explain the minutest fucking
detail, she goes full fucking Bartleby.


377
00:17:31.098 --> 00:17:34.869
- Huh?
- It's Melville. It's...


378
00:17:34.902 --> 00:17:37.405
- Whatever, you explain it to him.
- I'd prefer not to.


379
00:17:37.439 --> 00:17:39.575
She doesn't
want to tell us shit, dude.


380
00:17:39.607 --> 00:17:43.211
Why are you so relentless, man?
Nobody's holding out on you.


381
00:17:43.245 --> 00:17:47.917
Because that piece of shit
did this to my sister, dude.


382
00:17:47.950 --> 00:17:49.951
And if this all went down
the way she said it went down...


383
00:17:49.985 --> 00:17:50.987
If?

384
00:17:58.727 --> 00:18:01.030
Ruthy. Uh,
I've been meaning to ask you.


385
00:18:01.063 --> 00:18:03.866
Do you, um... you like cars?
Are you a car guy?


386
00:18:03.899 --> 00:18:07.369
Uh, no not...
I... [COUGHS, SNIFFLES]


387
00:18:07.401 --> 00:18:10.538
- Great.
- ...have been in several cars.

00:18:10.572 --> 00:18:13.709
In the past. Before.

I should have...

Meghan.

393
00:18:31.559 --> 00:18:34.996

Oh, my God.

- Fuck.
- [SCOFFS]

He's been leaving for work
super early lately.


402
00:19:07.662 --> 00:19:09.698
I followed him once.

403
00:19:09.730 --> 00:19:12.901
Not to be like psycho wife
or anything, I just...


404
00:19:14.702 --> 00:19:18.039
He's been sitting outside
in the parking lot


405
00:19:18.073 --> 00:19:20.242
where the kid
goes to football practice.


406
00:19:21.809 --> 00:19:24.613
He just sits in his car
and he watches him go in.


407
00:19:28.216 --> 00:19:30.452
You don't think he's...

408
00:19:30.485 --> 00:19:32.588
Do you think
he's gonna do something?


409

00:19:43.998 --> 00:19:45.233
I would never.
