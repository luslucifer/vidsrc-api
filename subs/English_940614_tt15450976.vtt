[dark music]

8
00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:59.550
So, how'd I do?

9
00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:01.470
Better, right?

10
00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:03.700
Actually, you're two seconds
slower than your top speed,


11
00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:06.390
which, as I've told you before,
subpar.


12
00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:09.290
That can't be.

13
00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:11.220
I've been practicing
day and night.


14
00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:13.230
- Let me try again.
- Sabrina.


15
00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:20.110
I've hesitated saying this
for a long time, but...


16
00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:22.550
you just don't have
what it takes


17
00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:24.140
to compete in the Summer Games.

18
00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:27.400
Coach, this is
my whole purpose in life.


19
00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:29.150
I have to be the best.

20
00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:30.330
I have to be.

21
00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:33.730
Please, give me another chance.

22
00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:36.000
I've given you more chances
than anyone I've coached.


23
00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:39.420
I'm sorry, I really am.

24
00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:40.930
I have what it takes.

25
00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:42.510
And you know it.

26
00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:46.430
You've always known it.

27
00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:57.340
[Coach Sharky]
Sabrina, don't do that.


28
00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:58.280
Come on.

29
00:02:59.030 --> 00:02:59.820
Sabrina.

30
00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:03.030
We've gone over this before.

31
00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:04.010
I'm married.

32
00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:05.700
And even if I wasn't married,

33
00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:06.870
I'm too old for you.

34
00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:09.090
No, you're not.
You're perfect for me.


35
00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:10.200
I think you need to go.

36
00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:11.690
Coach, please, I love you.

37
00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:13.120
You know how much I love you.

38
00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:14.770
I have always loved you.

39
00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:16.380
Coach, please, don't go.

40
00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:17.840
Sabrina!

41
00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:21.550
You need professional help.

Where are you going?

48
00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:22.780
Sabrina?

49
00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:25.780
- Where are you going?
- Work.


50
00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:26.780
Good.

51
00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:28.770
Doing what?

52
00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:30.530
Teaching brats to swim, okay?

53
00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:32.360
You satisfied?

54
00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:33.700
Yes.

55
00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:35.680
And you should be too.

56
00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:37.770
It's great you're finally
doing something...


57
00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:38.630
Great?

58
00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:40.540
It's an insult.

59
00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:42.450
I trained my entire life
for the big leagues,


60
00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:43.460
and now I'm just a...

61
00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:47.470
Well, we both know why
you lost your shot


62
00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:48.640
at the big leagues.

63
00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:49.970
Don't we?

[dark music]

65
00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:55.640

Mr. Scott?

70
00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:38.850
Hi, I'm...

71
00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:40.020
Sabrina Jameson.

72
00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:41.440
Swim instructor, right?

73
00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:44.670
I guess the inflatables
gave me away.


74
00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:45.480
Yeah.

75
00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:47.180
Let me wash up.

76
00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:48.920
Come on in and meet my daughter,
Ashley.


77
00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:51.120
Sabrina, call me Parker.

78
00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:56.540
[dark music]

79
00:05:56.760 --> 00:05:57.540
Parker...

00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:00.930
[Parker]
What would you like to drink?


81
00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:02.950
Oh, water's fine.

82
00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:05.050
You'd think since I swim in it
I'd hate the stuff,


83
00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:06.200
but no.

84
00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:07.550
[Parker]
Great.


85
00:06:15.970 --> 00:06:17.140
I'll be right back.

86
00:06:27.130 --> 00:06:29.400
[dark music]

87
00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:00.940
Be right there.

[soft music]

00:07:10.610 --> 00:07:12.280
Hey, you must be Ashley.

[running footsteps]

91
00:07:17.850 --> 00:07:19.190
[Parker] Catch a
glimpse of the princess?


92
00:07:19.350 --> 00:07:21.940
I did, she's really pretty.

93
00:07:22.030 --> 00:07:23.290
Totally takes after her mom.

94
00:07:25.290 --> 00:07:26.250
Anyways.

95
00:07:27.610 --> 00:07:30.800
My wife, Ellen,
had this beautiful pool built.


96
00:07:32.640 --> 00:07:34.540
Because she thought it would be
great for family time.


97
00:07:34.700 --> 00:07:36.290
Absolutely.

98
00:07:36.310 --> 00:07:37.700
Yeah, and then there was
an incident


99
00:07:37.790 --> 00:07:39.380
and now Ashley's afraid
of the water.


100
00:07:39.530 --> 00:07:40.810
[dark music]

101
00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:42.060
What happened?

102
00:07:42.810 --> 00:07:44.290
Um...

103
00:07:44.390 --> 00:07:45.870
It's okay if you
don't want to tell me,


104
00:07:45.960 --> 00:07:47.800
but it might help me
to figure out


105
00:07:47.890 --> 00:07:49.060
how to reach her.

106
00:07:49.150 --> 00:07:51.470
Have you tried to teach Ashley
to swim yourself?


107
00:07:51.990 --> 00:07:54.470
Yeah. I can't even get her
near the water.


108
00:07:54.570 --> 00:07:57.450
And, um... how 'bout your wife?

109
00:07:58.220 --> 00:07:59.550
Did she try?

110
00:07:59.570 --> 00:08:01.240
Yeah, about that.

111
00:08:01.330 --> 00:08:03.160
My wife, Ellen, um...

112
00:08:03.890 --> 00:08:05.390
She's away for a while.

113
00:08:05.410 --> 00:08:06.330
Oh.

114
00:08:06.820 --> 00:08:07.840
Where is she?

115
00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:11.560
Uh, she's with family.

116
00:08:12.580 --> 00:08:14.510
[Ellen] The job just
started to wear me down.


117
00:08:15.850 --> 00:08:20.600
Pretty soon, I was...
drinking to face trial dates.


118
00:08:22.850 --> 00:08:24.500
And then the worst day of all.

119
00:08:24.520 --> 00:08:26.980
[somber music]

120
00:08:29.170 --> 00:08:30.920
I had told
my 10-year-old daughter


121
00:08:31.010 --> 00:08:32.780
that I'd give her
a swimming lesson.


122
00:08:34.420 --> 00:08:37.270
But I was drunk
and I passed out.


123
00:08:37.370 --> 00:08:38.870
[inhales sharply, sighs]

124
00:08:40.040 --> 00:08:42.120
Ashley decided
she could swim anyway.


125
00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:47.960
I'm lucky my husband
was home that day.


126
00:08:49.550 --> 00:08:50.880
I don't know
what would have happened


127
00:08:51.110 --> 00:08:51.880
if he wasn't there.

128
00:08:54.940 --> 00:08:57.380
A mother is supposed
to protect her baby.


129
00:09:01.120 --> 00:09:02.850
My name is Ellen Scott.

130
00:09:04.890 --> 00:09:06.350
And I'm an alcoholic.

131

[knocking on door]

132
00:09:13.960 --> 00:09:15.070
Ashley, sweetheart?

133
00:09:15.300 --> 00:09:17.700
[soft music]

134
00:09:20.970 --> 00:09:22.080
[door opens]

135
00:09:31.980 --> 00:09:32.880
One second.

136
00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:43.910
Ash, I know you're in there
and I know you can hear me.


137
00:09:44.770 --> 00:09:47.490
I asked this nice young lady,
Sabrina,


138
00:09:47.590 --> 00:09:49.770
to maybe give you
some swim lessons.


139
00:09:49.920 --> 00:09:50.940
What do you say?

140
00:09:54.280 --> 00:09:55.940
[mouths]
Let me try.


141
00:10:04.510 --> 00:10:05.580
Hey, Ashley.

142
00:10:06.680 --> 00:10:07.450
I'm Sabrina.

143
00:10:08.850 --> 00:10:11.130
You know, I was just like you
at your age.


144
00:10:11.850 --> 00:10:13.130
You couldn't get me near a pool.

145
00:10:14.860 --> 00:10:18.190
But then... one day
this great swimming teacher


146
00:10:18.210 --> 00:10:20.190
helped me get over my fears
and now...


147
00:10:20.210 --> 00:10:23.640
And now... Sabrina is training
for the Summer Games.


148
00:10:25.550 --> 00:10:27.050
The Summer Games?

149
00:10:27.140 --> 00:10:29.060
The real Summer Games?

150
00:10:29.700 --> 00:10:30.890
That's right.

151
00:10:30.980 --> 00:10:33.150
And if you wanted,

152
00:10:33.300 --> 00:10:35.320
maybe one day you could be
on the national team too.


153
00:10:36.820 --> 00:10:38.820
But we're never gonna know
unless you get in the water.


154
00:10:42.320 --> 00:10:43.160
'Kay.

155
00:10:43.660 --> 00:10:44.880
All right then.

156
00:10:45.390 --> 00:10:46.160
Go on and get into your swimsuit

157
00:10:46.310 --> 00:10:46.990
and I'll meet you outside.

158
00:10:51.890 --> 00:10:54.170
[soft, eerie music]

159
00:11:12.020 --> 00:11:12.940
All right.

160
00:11:14.360 --> 00:11:16.270
I'm gonna sit right over there
at that patio table.


161
00:11:16.860 --> 00:11:17.360
And...

162

[dreamy music]

163
00:11:20.860 --> 00:11:21.780
Do my...

164
00:11:25.520 --> 00:11:28.950
work, but I'll keep an eye
on you the whole time, okay?


165
00:11:33.530 --> 00:11:34.370
All right.

166
00:11:35.440 --> 00:11:36.460
Now.

167
00:11:37.860 --> 00:11:39.210
First thing we're gonna do
is touch the water.


168
00:11:40.110 --> 00:11:41.220
[sighs]

169
00:11:46.610 --> 00:11:47.300
See?

170
00:11:48.620 --> 00:11:49.710
The other teachers
tried that same trick


171
00:11:49.800 --> 00:11:50.810
and it didn't work.

172
00:11:54.380 --> 00:11:57.480
Well, let's try stepping
into the pool together.


173
00:11:58.640 --> 00:12:00.030
I'll hold your hand
the whole time.


174
00:12:29.670 --> 00:12:31.080
Here, let's try
something different.


175
00:12:31.100 --> 00:12:31.930
May I?

176
00:12:33.100 --> 00:12:34.020
Come here.

177
00:12:36.010 --> 00:12:36.770
Good job.

178
00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:37.770
There we go.

179
00:12:43.110 --> 00:12:43.900
Okay.

180
00:12:45.110 --> 00:12:46.000
This is gonna take
a whole lot of courage,


181
00:12:46.100 --> 00:12:47.450
but I know you can do it, okay?

182
00:12:48.270 --> 00:12:50.030
Watch me first and then you try.

183
00:12:52.010 --> 00:12:54.290
[soft music]

184
00:12:56.440 --> 00:12:57.790
All right, you watching?
You ready?

[Ashley laughs]

187
00:13:06.540 --> 00:13:07.540
All right, come on.

188
00:13:07.640 --> 00:13:08.620
It's not bad, I promise.

189
00:13:08.640 --> 00:13:09.640
Come on.

190
00:13:20.820 --> 00:13:21.980
All right, you ready?

191
00:13:22.130 --> 00:13:24.150
One, two, three.

192
00:13:25.640 --> 00:13:28.070
[laughing]

193
00:13:29.660 --> 00:13:30.820
All right, now splash me,
come on.


194
00:13:31.980 --> 00:13:33.390
No, a real one!
Splash me, come on.


195
00:13:33.480 --> 00:13:34.480
[laughing]

196
00:13:34.500 --> 00:13:35.240
Come on.

[distant humming]

201
00:14:19.380 --> 00:14:20.450
You're doing it again.

202
00:14:20.540 --> 00:14:22.040
What? What am I doing?

203
00:14:22.270 --> 00:14:24.690
[soft, tense music]

204
00:14:24.710 --> 00:14:27.050
You're obsessing
over some older man.


205
00:14:28.440 --> 00:14:29.770
Who is he this time?

206
00:14:29.790 --> 00:14:31.220
Oh, wait, I know.

207
00:14:32.300 --> 00:14:34.300
The father of the "brat"
you had to teach.


208
00:14:35.620 --> 00:14:36.630
So?

209
00:14:36.780 --> 00:14:38.040
He's married, right?

210
00:14:38.060 --> 00:14:39.230
That is none of your business.

211
00:14:39.380 --> 00:14:40.390
[Khloe]
Oh, the hell it isn't.


212
00:14:41.970 --> 00:14:44.470
I said that you could live here
as long as you promised


213
00:14:44.630 --> 00:14:46.120
to never do this again.

214
00:14:46.140 --> 00:14:48.380
But, Mom, this one
is perfect for me.


215
00:14:48.400 --> 00:14:49.070
He's...

216
00:14:50.570 --> 00:14:51.910
He's perfect.

217
00:14:52.130 --> 00:14:53.070
Oh, Sabrina.

218
00:14:53.910 --> 00:14:55.970
Your father left you.

219
00:14:55.990 --> 00:14:57.800
And you going after
these older men


220
00:14:57.900 --> 00:14:59.150
isn't going to bring him home.

221
00:14:59.310 --> 00:15:01.470
[Sabrina] Yeah, and you
know why Dad walked out?


222
00:15:01.490 --> 00:15:02.730
Because of you.

223
00:15:02.830 --> 00:15:05.990
You drove him out,
and I miss him every single day.


224
00:15:06.090 --> 00:15:07.160
Miss him all you want.

225
00:15:07.310 --> 00:15:08.740
He's never coming back.

226
00:15:08.760 --> 00:15:12.590
And if you think you're gonna
find him in these other men,


227
00:15:12.820 --> 00:15:14.990
- you're dead wrong.
- Parker is different.


228
00:15:15.010 --> 00:15:16.560
His marriage is in trouble.

229
00:15:18.990 --> 00:15:19.580
He needs me.

230
00:15:19.600 --> 00:15:20.990
[Khloe laughs]

231
00:15:21.750 --> 00:15:23.940
Okay, I'm gonna call
Dr. Gonzalez.


232
00:15:24.160 --> 00:15:25.590
What? No.

233
00:15:25.680 --> 00:15:27.330
He'll make me take
those pills again.


234
00:15:27.350 --> 00:15:29.680
Yeah, you need to take
those pills again.


235
00:15:29.840 --> 00:15:31.590
I don't need any damn pills.

236
00:15:31.610 --> 00:15:32.450
Stop.

237
00:15:32.950 --> 00:15:33.780
Give it.

238
00:15:35.120 --> 00:15:35.780
Fine.

239
00:15:36.690 --> 00:15:38.190
You don't want to get help?

240
00:15:38.350 --> 00:15:40.120
Then you gotta call this Parker

241
00:15:40.350 --> 00:15:41.790
and tell him that you're gonna
turn down the job.


242
00:15:42.460 --> 00:15:43.540
I can't do that.

243
00:15:47.020 --> 00:15:47.610
I love him.

244
00:15:47.630 --> 00:15:49.420
He's... he's the one.

What are you doing?

247
00:16:02.960 --> 00:16:05.310
I said what are you doing?

248
00:16:09.230 --> 00:16:11.820
I'm calling your client
and telling him you are unwell.

Mom.

250

Please don't ruin this
for me, please,


251
00:16:16.400 --> 00:16:17.660
I am begging you.

252
00:16:17.810 --> 00:16:20.410
This is for your own good,
Sabrina, and you know it.


253
00:16:29.580 --> 00:16:30.340
You've gotta be kidding me.

254
00:16:30.490 --> 00:16:31.320
Knock it off.

This is Park... 
[phone beeps off]

00:16:42.740 --> 00:16:43.930
I said not to call him.

00:16:44.020 --> 00:16:45.810
I told you don't call.

262
00:16:47.010 --> 00:16:48.440
What is the matter
with you? Get up.

Yep.

Dad, can Sabrina stay
for dinner?

Ashley, I'm sure
she has other plans,

not to mention other students.

I could rearrange my schedule.

Oh, you don't have to do that.

[Ashley]
Please, Dad?


283
00:18:35.860 --> 00:18:37.460
You can make your famous pasta.

Famous pasta, huh?

00:18:43.310 --> 00:18:44.550

[crickets chirring]

And, fortunately, I was
working from home that day


288
00:18:50.370 --> 00:18:52.150
and just happened to check on
Ashley's progress.


289
00:18:52.300 --> 00:18:54.650
I mean, had I shown up
a minute later...


290
00:18:55.480 --> 00:18:57.390
Oh my God, no.

291
00:18:57.490 --> 00:19:02.050
Yeah. So, that's why Ashley's
afraid of the water,


292
00:19:02.070 --> 00:19:04.160
and that's when
Ellen and I decided


293
00:19:04.310 --> 00:19:05.830
she needed to go to rehab.

294
00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:10.500
Sorry, I didn't feel comfortable
telling you sooner,

- No, no, it's okay.

Ashley is the center of my life.

I haven't seen her
this happy in months.


303
00:19:28.850 --> 00:19:30.180
It's all because of you.

Come on, I'm just givin' her
swim lessons.


305

No, I'm serious.

306
00:19:35.690 --> 00:19:38.190
It's in the care and the concern
that you show for her.


307
00:19:38.420 --> 00:19:40.030
I mean, you treat her
like she's your own.


308
00:19:41.590 --> 00:19:43.200
I can't tell you
how much that means to me.

Forgive me.

Look, I...I would be lying
if I was to tell you

that I'm not extremely attracted
to you.

But I'm still deeply committed
to my wife Ellen.

Of course you are.

in the moment.

I guess I did too.

Ah, so, um...

said I'm ready to come home.

And how's my baby?

335
00:21:03.260 --> 00:21:04.610
She's doing great.

336
00:21:05.610 --> 00:21:07.950
I finally found her
a swim instructor.


337
00:21:09.010 --> 00:21:09.950
Sabrina.

338
00:21:10.180 --> 00:21:12.280
And she's training
for the Summer Games.


339
00:21:12.770 --> 00:21:13.620
Ash loves her.

340
00:21:14.440 --> 00:21:15.360
She's like a little dolphin,

341
00:21:15.460 --> 00:21:16.960
I can hardly keep her
out of the pool.


342
00:21:20.520 --> 00:21:21.290
[sighs]

343
00:21:21.960 --> 00:21:22.630
What's the matter?

344
00:21:24.540 --> 00:21:26.710
I wasn't there
for her first lesson.


345
00:21:26.860 --> 00:21:27.630
Don't worry.

346
00:21:28.800 --> 00:21:30.190
There'll be plenty more to come.

347
00:21:30.710 --> 00:21:31.640
See you in the morning?

348
00:21:32.370 --> 00:21:32.970
Okay.

349
00:21:33.810 --> 00:21:35.200
I'll be waiting.

350
00:21:35.220 --> 00:21:36.550
I love you.

351
00:21:36.650 --> 00:21:37.600
Love you too.

352
00:21:42.230 --> 00:21:43.650
[aide] I'll need your
phone back, please.


353
00:21:47.060 --> 00:21:47.990
[clears throat]

354
00:21:50.330 --> 00:21:51.160
[Ellen]
Thank you.


355
00:21:56.390 --> 00:21:58.670
[soft, tense music]

356
00:22:17.520 --> 00:22:19.930
[liquid glugging]

357
00:22:20.020 --> 00:22:22.360
[acid hissing]

358
00:22:39.210 --> 00:22:40.330
Fiji.

359
00:22:44.100 --> 00:22:45.210
How 'bout you, babe?

360
00:22:48.940 --> 00:22:51.340
[dark music]

361
00:22:53.780 --> 00:22:56.060
[soft music]

362
00:23:04.640 --> 00:23:05.570
[Ashley]
Sabrina!


363
00:23:06.790 --> 00:23:07.480
Hey!

364
00:23:07.570 --> 00:23:09.050
Big surprise.

365
00:23:09.150 --> 00:23:10.740
- Come on, hurry!
- Okay.


366
00:23:17.970 --> 00:23:18.490
Wow.

367
00:23:19.640 --> 00:23:22.040
- Okay, I'll be right back.
- Okay.


368
00:23:24.420 --> 00:23:27.590
So, what's all this
about a big surprise?


369
00:23:28.760 --> 00:23:29.760
Ellen's home.

370
00:23:30.820 --> 00:23:31.420
Oh.

371
00:23:32.260 --> 00:23:33.500
Yeah, it's a little unexpected,

372
00:23:33.650 --> 00:23:36.150
so I would appreciate it
if we could be discreet


373
00:23:36.170 --> 00:23:38.220
about our moment
the other night.


374
00:23:39.420 --> 00:23:40.180
Of course.

375
00:23:41.340 --> 00:23:42.680
Hey, I'm just here
for Ashley, right?


376
00:23:42.830 --> 00:23:43.900
No worries.

377
00:23:45.180 --> 00:23:46.400
Oh, wait.

378
00:23:48.020 --> 00:23:49.350
[laughing]

379
00:23:49.500 --> 00:23:50.500
[Ashley]
You're gonna [indistinct].


380
00:23:50.520 --> 00:23:52.450
Like, on day one
we had a splash fight.


381
00:23:52.670 --> 00:23:53.850
So much fun.

382
00:23:54.010 --> 00:23:55.410
You're gonna be so proud of me.

383
00:23:56.010 --> 00:23:56.740
Sabrina!

384
00:24:03.460 --> 00:24:04.700
Nice to meet you.

385
00:24:04.790 --> 00:24:05.960
My name is Ellen.

386
00:24:06.110 --> 00:24:07.440
So happy to meet you.

387
00:24:07.540 --> 00:24:08.960
- I'm Sabrina.
- I know!


388
00:24:09.110 --> 00:24:11.880
All I've been hearing since
I've been back is, "Sabrina!"


389
00:24:13.280 --> 00:24:15.090
Thank you so much
for teaching Ashley how to swim.


390
00:24:15.700 --> 00:24:16.640
My pleasure.

391
00:24:18.030 --> 00:24:20.030
Well, I've got to go
to a business meeting,


392
00:24:20.050 --> 00:24:21.880
so I'm gonna let you ladies
get acquainted.


393
00:24:21.980 --> 00:24:22.980
Make me proud.

394
00:24:25.050 --> 00:24:27.890
So, ready to show your mom
how great you are?


395
00:24:28.040 --> 00:24:28.820
I will.

396
00:24:37.490 --> 00:24:39.310
All right, let's go. Let's go.

397
00:24:39.330 --> 00:24:41.660
[laughing, indistinct chatter]

398
00:24:44.830 --> 00:24:45.670
Come on.

399
00:25:00.330 --> 00:25:01.660
Did you see me, Mom?

400
00:25:01.760 --> 00:25:04.180
[Ellen] Didn't take my
eyes off you for a second!


401
00:25:04.670 --> 00:25:06.140
You're doing great.

402
00:25:07.760 --> 00:25:09.690
That's because Sabrina
is such a great teacher.


403
00:25:09.920 --> 00:25:11.420
[laughs]

404
00:25:11.430 --> 00:25:13.010
Am I ready for the pros yet?

405
00:25:13.530 --> 00:25:14.530
You're gettin' there.

406
00:25:17.090 --> 00:25:19.260
[Sabrina] So, um, I
usually bring some snacks


407
00:25:19.280 --> 00:25:21.350
for Ashley to enjoy
after the lesson.


408
00:25:21.440 --> 00:25:23.040
Oh, how thoughtful of you.

409
00:25:26.430 --> 00:25:27.210
There we go.

410
00:25:28.790 --> 00:25:31.440
Granola bar and sports drink
for our world champion.


411
00:25:31.940 --> 00:25:33.550
And for the adults.

412
00:25:37.290 --> 00:25:39.540
One for you and one for Parker.

413
00:25:40.450 --> 00:25:42.720
Oh, my gosh, no, of course not.

414
00:25:42.870 --> 00:25:44.800
These are for you and Parker
to enjoy after dinner.


415
00:25:44.890 --> 00:25:45.560
[Ellen]
Mm.


416
00:25:47.060 --> 00:25:48.800
Thank you, but we can't have
these types of drinks


417
00:25:48.900 --> 00:25:49.730
in the house.

418
00:25:49.960 --> 00:25:51.400
Oh, why not?

419
00:25:52.960 --> 00:25:55.070
I'm on the program.

420
00:25:55.650 --> 00:25:56.810
Oh. Oh my gosh.

421
00:25:56.960 --> 00:25:58.910
I'm...I'm so sorry,
I didn't know.


422
00:25:59.890 --> 00:26:01.070
I'm sure you didn't.

423
00:26:04.560 --> 00:26:07.250
Well, I'll see you tomorrow
for our next lesson, 'kay?


424
00:26:07.470 --> 00:26:08.370
'Kay.

425
00:26:09.920 --> 00:26:13.240
Actually, I'll...I'll call you
to schedule the next lesson.


426
00:26:13.250 --> 00:26:14.250
Oh, you don't have to do that,

427
00:26:14.410 --> 00:26:15.920
I'll just show up
at our regular time.


428
00:26:16.570 --> 00:26:18.480
I'll call you to schedule
the next lesson.


429
00:26:18.500 --> 00:26:21.170
But I've been teaching Ashley
for three times a week


430
00:26:21.320 --> 00:26:22.320
for the past month.

431
00:26:22.340 --> 00:26:24.260
She's been making
such great progress.


432
00:26:24.420 --> 00:26:25.770
[Ellen]
And we appreciate that.


433
00:26:26.770 --> 00:26:27.730
I'll call you.

434
00:26:28.510 --> 00:26:29.010
Got it.

435
00:26:29.100 --> 00:26:31.600
[tense music]

436
00:26:43.950 --> 00:26:45.790
[engine revs]

437
00:26:45.940 --> 00:26:48.450
You are going to love
going back to rehab, Ellen.


438
00:26:55.710 --> 00:26:57.370
[Parker] So what are
your thoughts on Sabrina?


439
00:26:58.130 --> 00:26:59.720
Ashley's not having
a lesson tomorrow.


440
00:27:00.300 --> 00:27:01.300
I canceled it.

441
00:27:02.800 --> 00:27:04.030
It's obvious that Sabrina
is a little more interested


442
00:27:04.050 --> 00:27:06.430
in you than giving Ashley
a swimming lesson.


443
00:27:09.720 --> 00:27:10.640
[Parker]
I'm sorry?


444
00:27:11.700 --> 00:27:12.650
You lost me.

445
00:27:14.040 --> 00:27:15.270
I saw the two of you
talking to each other.


446
00:27:16.210 --> 00:27:16.980
And?

447
00:27:19.140 --> 00:27:20.210
What, you think
she's interested in me


448
00:27:20.230 --> 00:27:21.710
because we were talking
to each other?


449
00:27:21.730 --> 00:27:22.880
No.

450
00:27:22.900 --> 00:27:25.220
Because she was
straightening your tie.


451
00:27:25.310 --> 00:27:26.400
The hell was she doing that for?

452
00:27:26.490 --> 00:27:28.490
Come on, I told her
I had a business meeting.


453
00:27:28.720 --> 00:27:30.150
She probably noticed
it was crooked.


454
00:27:30.170 --> 00:27:31.330
[laughs]

455
00:27:31.560 --> 00:27:33.570
Yeah, I'm sure
that's not all she noticed.


456
00:27:34.500 --> 00:27:37.580
Babe, Sabrina and I
discuss Ashley's progress,


457
00:27:37.730 --> 00:27:39.410
I pay her, that's it.

458
00:27:39.920 --> 00:27:41.470
Over a couple of cold beers?

459
00:27:42.570 --> 00:27:43.420
What?

460
00:27:43.510 --> 00:27:45.340
She brought over snacks
for Ashley


461
00:27:45.500 --> 00:27:46.900
and two bottles of craft beer

462
00:27:46.920 --> 00:27:48.740
she claims were for you
and for me.


463
00:27:48.760 --> 00:27:50.260
Now, why would she do that?

464
00:27:50.350 --> 00:27:52.090
I don't know.

465
00:27:52.250 --> 00:27:54.170
She brings over snacks
and drinks all the time.


466
00:27:54.190 --> 00:27:56.020
She was probably being friendly.

467
00:27:59.010 --> 00:28:01.190
I was a divorce lawyer,
remember?


468
00:28:01.350 --> 00:28:03.850
I can spot women like her
from the next town over.


469
00:28:04.700 --> 00:28:06.370
Is this how we're gonna
celebrate you coming home?


470
00:28:08.540 --> 00:28:09.280
Just...

471
00:28:09.430 --> 00:28:11.370
[sighs]

472
00:28:11.520 --> 00:28:13.020
Answer one question.

473
00:28:13.040 --> 00:28:14.270
What?

474
00:28:14.360 --> 00:28:16.000
Did you tell her I was in rehab?

475
00:28:18.210 --> 00:28:19.450
Why would you do that?

476
00:28:19.610 --> 00:28:21.790
That is not something
that she needs to know.


477
00:28:21.940 --> 00:28:23.960
[Parker]
I'm sorry. You're right.


478
00:28:24.110 --> 00:28:25.550
It was a moment of weakness.

479
00:28:26.780 --> 00:28:27.720
Okay.

480
00:28:29.710 --> 00:28:34.060
But then... why would
she offer me a beer if...


481
00:28:35.960 --> 00:28:37.900
if she knew I had a problem?

482
00:28:39.130 --> 00:28:41.460
Look, I don't think
she was being malicious.


483
00:28:41.960 --> 00:28:43.070
She probably forgot.

484
00:28:44.650 --> 00:28:47.410
Babe, the main thing is she's
helped Ashley's confidence,


485
00:28:47.630 --> 00:28:49.580
Ashley adores her,
and now she can swim.


486
00:28:53.640 --> 00:28:54.540
Honey.

487
00:28:55.810 --> 00:28:57.480
Get out into the world again.

488
00:28:57.660 --> 00:28:58.920
Find a new job.

489
00:28:59.070 --> 00:29:01.000
Volunteer. Do something.

490
00:29:01.570 --> 00:29:03.260
But don't worry about Sabrina.

491
00:29:04.910 --> 00:29:06.430
She's here to teach Ashley.

492
00:29:07.910 --> 00:29:09.760
She's helped her a lot,
and that's all we need to know.


493
00:29:13.430 --> 00:29:15.890
[birds chirping]

494
00:29:17.850 --> 00:29:19.180
[dark music]

495
00:29:19.270 --> 00:29:21.730
[sighs deeply]

496
00:29:22.940 --> 00:29:25.500
[phone ringing]

497
00:29:25.520 --> 00:29:26.450
Hi.

498
00:29:27.170 --> 00:29:27.780
Steve?

499
00:29:28.780 --> 00:29:30.020
Ellen Scott here.

500
00:29:30.180 --> 00:29:31.450
Linda?

501
00:29:31.680 --> 00:29:33.100
Hi!

502
00:29:33.120 --> 00:29:34.360
Yeah, Ellen Scott.

503
00:29:34.510 --> 00:29:36.350
Oh, you're...you're in a meeting?

504
00:29:36.370 --> 00:29:39.610
Listen, I was calling
because I'm, um,


505
00:29:39.700 --> 00:29:40.940
ready to get back to work.

506
00:29:40.960 --> 00:29:42.540
You don't do family law anymore?

507
00:29:42.690 --> 00:29:43.800
Oh, okay.

508
00:29:44.800 --> 00:29:46.040
I'm sorry, I...

509
00:29:46.190 --> 00:29:47.710
[sighs]

510
00:29:47.860 --> 00:29:49.540
Listen, is Mr. Stafford in?

511
00:29:49.640 --> 00:29:51.300
I wanted to let him know
that I'm currently looking...


512
00:29:52.550 --> 00:29:55.980
No, I am not still in rehab.

513
00:30:10.660 --> 00:30:11.820
[grunts softly]

514
00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:18.330
[soft, dark music]

515
00:30:21.150 --> 00:30:23.500
[sighs deeply]

516
00:30:26.570 --> 00:30:28.840
[soft music]

517
00:30:45.750 --> 00:30:46.820
[sighs]

518
00:31:01.270 --> 00:31:03.540
[soft, tense music]

519
00:31:23.960 --> 00:31:26.230
[indistinct chatter, laughter]

520
00:31:36.150 --> 00:31:37.030
Surprise!

521
00:31:38.140 --> 00:31:41.160
We, uh...
we weren't expecting you.


522
00:31:41.310 --> 00:31:43.310
Well, I don't mean to interrupt,

523
00:31:43.330 --> 00:31:45.160
but the last time I came over,

524
00:31:45.310 --> 00:31:46.980
I think I must have dropped
my sunglasses


525
00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:48.250
somewhere in your backyard.

526
00:31:49.590 --> 00:31:50.760
Can I have a quick look?

527
00:31:52.760 --> 00:31:54.930
[indistinct chatter, laughter]

528
00:31:55.150 --> 00:31:56.930
Wow.

529
00:31:57.160 --> 00:31:59.100
Sounds like someone's
having a good time.


530
00:31:59.330 --> 00:32:00.340
Yeah.

531
00:32:00.840 --> 00:32:02.270
Look, I meant to call you.

532
00:32:03.270 --> 00:32:05.660
Ellen decided that
Ashley's progressing so well


533
00:32:05.680 --> 00:32:07.510
that she's ready
to go to the next level.


534
00:32:08.110 --> 00:32:10.070
Great, I've arrived
just in time.


535
00:32:11.450 --> 00:32:12.930
With someone else.

536
00:32:13.510 --> 00:32:14.930
[soft, tense music]

537
00:32:14.950 --> 00:32:16.430
What?

538
00:32:16.530 --> 00:32:19.010
Yeah, um, we decided to get
a medal-winner to teach her.


539
00:32:19.030 --> 00:32:19.620
Hold on...

540
00:32:21.010 --> 00:32:22.770
I may not have a medal yet,

541
00:32:22.790 --> 00:32:24.940
but I'm training
for the national team


542
00:32:24.960 --> 00:32:27.700
every single day of my life.

543
00:32:27.800 --> 00:32:29.630
You can't just go switching
a teacher on a kid


544
00:32:29.780 --> 00:32:30.610
like that suddenly,

545
00:32:30.710 --> 00:32:31.960
it's not good for them.

546
00:32:33.040 --> 00:32:35.450
I was also hoping
that we could sit down


547
00:32:35.470 --> 00:32:37.300
and map out a plan for Ashley.

548
00:32:39.290 --> 00:32:40.810
There's so much
I wanted to teach her.


549
00:32:43.980 --> 00:32:47.150
Uh... thank you for helping her
as much as you did.


550
00:32:50.470 --> 00:32:51.820
Can I at least tell her goodbye?

551
00:32:54.710 --> 00:32:55.780
[sighs]

552
00:32:56.660 --> 00:32:59.120
[water splashing]

553
00:33:02.740 --> 00:33:03.500
Hey.

554
00:33:04.890 --> 00:33:06.220
Sabrina thinks she left
her sunglasses here


555
00:33:06.240 --> 00:33:07.790
- the other day.
- Hey there.


556
00:33:09.150 --> 00:33:10.500
Mind if I have quick look?

557
00:33:13.510 --> 00:33:15.130
No. Go ahead.

558
00:33:19.680 --> 00:33:20.500
How's she doing?

559
00:33:20.920 --> 00:33:22.160
She's doing great.

560
00:33:22.260 --> 00:33:23.350
Having a lot of fun.

561
00:33:24.740 --> 00:33:25.640
I gotta jump, okay?

562
00:33:26.520 --> 00:33:28.850
[soft, dark music]

563
00:33:36.090 --> 00:33:38.860
Well, I can't find
those darn sunglasses.


564
00:33:39.090 --> 00:33:40.320
Who knows where
I might've left 'em.


565
00:33:41.440 --> 00:33:43.760
Anyway, Parker mentioned

566
00:33:43.780 --> 00:33:45.870
you found someone new
to teach Ashley.


567
00:33:48.190 --> 00:33:49.880
I thought I'd say goodbye,
but...


568
00:33:55.940 --> 00:33:57.220
I can't believe it.

569
00:34:00.610 --> 00:34:01.390
Donna Dean.

570
00:34:01.540 --> 00:34:03.800
The Donna Dean, bronze medalist?

571
00:34:03.890 --> 00:34:04.710
That's me.

572
00:34:05.380 --> 00:34:06.230
And the gold medal's up next.

573
00:34:06.450 --> 00:34:07.210
[laughs]

574
00:34:07.230 --> 00:34:08.470
Great.

575
00:34:08.620 --> 00:34:09.730
Donna's gonna help me
get to the Summer Games.


576
00:34:09.880 --> 00:34:12.470
I saw you, little dolphin,
you're doing great!


577
00:34:13.310 --> 00:34:15.290
[Ashley]
Mom, I have to use the bathroom.


578
00:34:15.310 --> 00:34:18.530
Okay, but don't run,
and don't get water everywhere.


579
00:34:23.060 --> 00:34:25.240
So, I hear
you got Ashley started.


580
00:34:25.400 --> 00:34:27.060
Yeah, but, I mean,
how great for her


581
00:34:27.080 --> 00:34:28.810
that you're teaching her now.

582
00:34:29.230 --> 00:34:30.660
By the way, I'm a huge fan.

583
00:34:30.750 --> 00:34:31.810
Well, thank you.

584
00:34:31.830 --> 00:34:33.230
[dark music]

585
00:34:33.330 --> 00:34:34.880
Wait, don't I know you?

586
00:34:36.590 --> 00:34:37.820
You two know each other.

587
00:34:37.830 --> 00:34:38.830
[Donna]
I remember now.


588
00:34:38.930 --> 00:34:40.650
You were training
for the national team


589
00:34:40.740 --> 00:34:42.430
with Coach Sharky
about a year ago.


590
00:34:42.660 --> 00:34:44.000
I used to stand
on the sidelines sometimes


591
00:34:44.160 --> 00:34:45.340
and watch everybody.

592
00:34:45.990 --> 00:34:47.920
- Wait, who?
- Coach Wallace.


593
00:34:48.010 --> 00:34:49.580
Sharky is his nickname.

594
00:34:49.600 --> 00:34:51.230
Best swimming coach in town.

595
00:34:52.670 --> 00:34:55.110
But then you suddenly
had to leave the team.


596
00:34:55.940 --> 00:34:57.020
What was that all about?

597
00:34:57.110 --> 00:34:58.440
[intense music]

598
00:34:58.600 --> 00:35:00.950
[water gurgling]

599
00:35:07.960 --> 00:35:09.440
Are you angry with me?

600
00:35:09.460 --> 00:35:11.270
What? No. Of course not.

601
00:35:11.370 --> 00:35:12.350
My mom thought it would be good

602
00:35:12.370 --> 00:35:13.960
for a real medalist to teach me.

603
00:35:14.110 --> 00:35:15.940
That's why Donna's here.

604
00:35:15.960 --> 00:35:17.800
Well, your mom is a smart woman.

605
00:35:19.040 --> 00:35:20.860
You know,
if Ashley were my daughter,


606
00:35:20.880 --> 00:35:22.860
I'd fire me and hire Donna.

607
00:35:22.880 --> 00:35:23.970
You would?

608
00:35:24.120 --> 00:35:24.970
Oh, hell yeah.

609
00:35:25.200 --> 00:35:25.550
Oops.

610
00:35:25.700 --> 00:35:26.640
[giggles]

611
00:35:28.200 --> 00:35:30.140
I just wanted to say goodbye.

612
00:35:31.370 --> 00:35:32.540
Keep up the great work, okay?

613
00:35:32.550 --> 00:35:34.940
[soft music]

614
00:35:35.820 --> 00:35:37.270
You have a fantastic teacher.

615
00:35:41.660 --> 00:35:42.490
Okay.

616
00:35:45.220 --> 00:35:45.990
Look.

617
00:35:48.890 --> 00:35:51.790
It's obvious that
you bonded with Ashley.


618
00:35:52.390 --> 00:35:52.960
And...

619
00:35:53.910 --> 00:35:57.060
well, if you have the time, uh,

620
00:35:57.080 --> 00:35:59.080
why don't you drop by
for Ashley's next lesson


621
00:35:59.170 --> 00:36:00.820
and hang out with us.

622
00:36:00.920 --> 00:36:02.170
I mean, if you want to.

623
00:36:03.090 --> 00:36:04.180
I'd love to.

624
00:36:05.090 --> 00:36:06.350
And just so you know...

625
00:36:07.410 --> 00:36:08.850
Ashley was my best student.

626
00:36:09.580 --> 00:36:10.330
Really?

627
00:36:10.350 --> 00:36:11.590
Yeah, I mean, look at her.

628
00:36:11.690 --> 00:36:13.520
She's a natural.

629
00:36:17.020 --> 00:36:18.020
Thank you.

630
00:36:19.530 --> 00:36:22.860
And thank you for being
such a great sport about this.


631
00:36:23.010 --> 00:36:23.860
Of course.

632
00:36:25.610 --> 00:36:27.370
Ashley's in great hands
with Donna.


633
00:36:30.610 --> 00:36:31.660
[Ellen]
Yeah, she is.


634
00:36:33.520 --> 00:36:34.690
Go enjoy
your daughter's progress.


635
00:36:34.710 --> 00:36:36.000
I'll show myself out.

636
00:36:42.380 --> 00:36:43.220
Perfect.

637
00:36:44.220 --> 00:36:45.380
Perfect.

638
00:36:51.280 --> 00:36:53.560
[dark music]

639
00:37:04.570 --> 00:37:06.890
Can't wait to redo this place.

640
00:37:06.980 --> 00:37:09.240
[airplane engine roaring]

641
00:37:14.810 --> 00:37:17.820
[Parker] Well, Sabrina took that
better than I thought she would.


642
00:37:18.570 --> 00:37:19.810
[Ellen]
And she said she'd love


643
00:37:19.830 --> 00:37:21.920
to stop by and hang out
for Ashley's lessons.


644
00:37:22.150 --> 00:37:23.260
Oh, really?

645
00:37:23.480 --> 00:37:24.590
[laughs]

646
00:37:25.910 --> 00:37:28.240
I'm sorry I jumped the gun
on Sabrina.


647
00:37:28.990 --> 00:37:30.500
She really does seem
like a sweet young woman.


648
00:37:30.600 --> 00:37:31.490
[Parker]
Told ya.


649
00:37:31.510 --> 00:37:32.580
Mm.

650
00:37:32.670 --> 00:37:34.080
See you tomorrow night?

651
00:37:34.180 --> 00:37:36.160
[Parker] Unless you've
changed the locks on the doors.


652
00:37:36.180 --> 00:37:36.730
Mm.

653
00:37:39.440 --> 00:37:43.280
I bought something sexy to wear.

654
00:37:43.500 --> 00:37:45.110
In that case,
I'm definitely comin' home.


655
00:37:45.260 --> 00:37:46.090
[chuckles]

656
00:37:46.110 --> 00:37:48.340
[Ellen]
Oh, before you go.


657
00:37:48.360 --> 00:37:50.770
Do you remember that photo
of the three of us


658
00:37:50.790 --> 00:37:52.620
that was above the fireplace?

659
00:37:53.440 --> 00:37:54.450
It's gone.

660
00:37:55.940 --> 00:37:57.860
Babe, there's a lot of photos
above the fireplace.


661
00:37:58.020 --> 00:38:00.250
Yeah, but this one was taken
after I got back from rehab.


662
00:38:01.130 --> 00:38:01.960

I do remember the photo,

but... I don't know
where it is.


665
00:38:06.970 --> 00:38:09.380
We'll find it
when I get back, okay?


666
00:38:09.530 --> 00:38:12.120
I just don't understand
why it's not there.


667
00:38:12.140 --> 00:38:13.120
It's always there.

668
00:38:13.220 --> 00:38:15.310
Honey, you go to sleep.

669
00:38:16.040 --> 00:38:16.810
I'll see you tomorrow.

670
00:38:17.550 --> 00:38:19.310
- Love you.
- Love you too.

Hey!

680
00:39:42.210 --> 00:39:43.790
I'm here to hang out with you

681
00:39:43.880 --> 00:39:45.290
for Ashley's lesson with Donna.

682
00:39:45.310 --> 00:39:47.720
Uh, you're a day early.

683
00:39:47.740 --> 00:39:49.140
Donna doesn't get here
till tomorrow


684
00:39:49.240 --> 00:39:50.740
and Ashley's still not back yet
from school.


685
00:39:50.890 --> 00:39:52.720
Agh, darn it.

686
00:39:53.130 --> 00:39:54.740
Must have gotten my dates
mixed up again.


687
00:39:55.980 --> 00:39:59.300
Anyway, I stopped by
this super cute bakery


688
00:39:59.320 --> 00:40:01.300
and picked up some
gourmet cookies for everyone.

Yeah, I know that place.

Wilka's, we go there
all the time.


691
00:40:04.730 --> 00:40:05.990
Everything they make
is so great.


692
00:40:06.150 --> 00:40:07.090
I know!

693
00:40:09.570 --> 00:40:12.150
Well, since you're here,
come on in.


694
00:40:12.590 --> 00:40:13.260
I'll make some coffee.

695
00:40:13.490 --> 00:40:14.580
Great!

696
00:40:14.600 --> 00:40:17.340
[soft, dark music]

697
00:40:17.490 --> 00:40:20.430
[Ellen] So you're all right
switching off lessons with Donna?


698
00:40:22.160 --> 00:40:24.180
We'll try it
and see how it goes.


699
00:40:24.330 --> 00:40:27.010
Oh, absolutely,
I think it's a great idea.


700
00:40:27.110 --> 00:40:29.940
Honestly, thank you for even
keeping me on the team.

Oh, I hope peanut butter
chocolate chip's okay.

You won't get any argument
from me.


703
00:40:49.130 --> 00:40:51.250
Oh, uh, Sabrina, um...

704
00:40:53.280 --> 00:40:54.470
there's...

705
00:40:54.620 --> 00:40:55.690
Thank you.

706
00:40:55.710 --> 00:40:58.380
Something that's been
bothering me.


707
00:40:59.290 --> 00:41:01.970
The other day when you
brought over the, um...


708
00:41:03.960 --> 00:41:04.790
- The beers?
- Yeah.


709
00:41:04.810 --> 00:41:07.480
Oh, God, I'm so sorry.

710
00:41:08.210 --> 00:41:09.980
Parker told me
and I just wasn't thinking.


711
00:41:11.130 --> 00:41:12.060
Can you forgive me?

712
00:41:12.150 --> 00:41:13.800
Oh, of course.

713
00:41:13.900 --> 00:41:16.150
It's just that, as you know,

714
00:41:16.380 --> 00:41:19.230
I can't have any substances
in the house.


715
00:41:19.330 --> 00:41:21.910
No... alcohol.

716
00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:27.500
Mm, no... prescription
painkillers.


717
00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:29.320
No weed.

718
00:41:29.340 --> 00:41:31.000
I completely understand.

719
00:41:31.230 --> 00:41:31.840
Now...

720
00:41:34.170 --> 00:41:35.670
You gotta share
the guilt with me.


721
00:41:42.920 --> 00:41:45.520
Uh-uh, these are for you
and your family.


722
00:41:46.350 --> 00:41:48.000
I bought some for myself
and it is gonna take


723
00:41:48.020 --> 00:41:50.020
absolutely all of my willpower

724
00:41:50.170 --> 00:41:51.840
not to eat them
before I get home, so...


725
00:41:52.340 --> 00:41:54.180
Well, in that case,

726
00:41:54.190 --> 00:41:57.030
these are going
in the cupboard for later,


727
00:41:57.180 --> 00:41:59.110
otherwise they'll be gone
before Parker and Ashley


728
00:41:59.200 --> 00:41:59.700
even get here.

Oh, Sabrina, hi, it was great!

and why are you here?

She had a little headache
so she's taking a nap,


759
00:44:08.550 --> 00:44:10.550
and I'm here
because I thought today


760
00:44:10.570 --> 00:44:11.830
was your lesson with Donna.

761
00:44:12.500 --> 00:44:13.670
My bad.

762
00:44:15.170 --> 00:44:17.910
Anyway, I was about to leave
unless you want to show me

what Donna's been teaching you.

let me see what you know.

don't stop now!

How did I do?

I don't wanna get out
of the pool yet.

no unsupervised swimming

If you want to swim, go ahead.

No unsupervised swimming.

Yeah, and where's your mom?

Resting, she had a headache.

in here by yourself?

I... I wasn't drinking.


829
00:48:20.410 --> 00:48:22.910
I trusted you,
and you did it again!


830
00:48:23.830 --> 00:48:25.920
I... I wasn't, I swear.

831
00:48:28.480 --> 00:48:29.250
Oh!

832
00:48:30.420 --> 00:48:32.500
Where'd you hide it this time?

833
00:48:32.650 --> 00:48:34.090
I know you put it somewhere.

834
00:49:09.020 --> 00:49:09.630
[she groans]

835
00:49:13.530 --> 00:49:15.860
Look what I found
underneath the sofa.


836
00:49:15.880 --> 00:49:17.380
Now, why would it be there?

837
00:49:17.470 --> 00:49:19.530
I don't... I don't know.

838
00:49:19.550 --> 00:49:20.860
Yes, you do!

839
00:49:20.880 --> 00:49:22.460
You put it there!

840
00:49:22.480 --> 00:49:24.980
Ashley was in the pool, alone!

841
00:49:26.300 --> 00:49:28.540
One of us is supposed
to be out there


842
00:49:28.560 --> 00:49:30.770
watching her at all times,
you know that.


843
00:49:31.650 --> 00:49:33.470
I... I swear, I...

844
00:49:33.490 --> 00:49:36.490
I didn't even know she...
came home.


845
00:49:38.220 --> 00:49:38.990
[she groans]

846
00:49:41.160 --> 00:49:42.290
You blacked out.

847
00:49:45.570 --> 00:49:48.000
No, baby, that's impossible.

848
00:49:48.150 --> 00:49:49.500
I... I... I...

849
00:49:52.400 --> 00:49:54.010
You're gonna have to go back.

850
00:49:55.250 --> 00:49:57.510
[Ellen]
What? No! Please.


851
00:49:57.660 --> 00:49:59.340
[Parker]
We're not gonna lose Ashley


852
00:49:59.500 --> 00:50:01.660
because you can't control
your drinking problem.


853
00:50:01.760 --> 00:50:02.920
[Ellen]
I can't go back.


854
00:50:03.070 --> 00:50:04.920
[sobbing]

855
00:50:05.080 --> 00:50:08.090
- This is Parker Scott.
- No, no, please! Please!


856
00:50:08.190 --> 00:50:09.430
[unintelligible]

857
00:50:09.580 --> 00:50:11.020
No, no!

858
00:50:11.860 --> 00:50:14.430
Please, I can't go back!

859
00:50:14.530 --> 00:50:16.490
[sobbing]

[he sighs]

863
00:50:41.950 --> 00:50:43.350
I'll check in on you every day.

864
00:50:45.120 --> 00:50:46.060
Ashley.

865
00:50:48.470 --> 00:50:49.560
Honey, honey, honey, honey.

866
00:50:50.960 --> 00:50:52.050
I know.

867
00:50:52.140 --> 00:50:53.570
You gotta get in the car.

868
00:50:57.240 --> 00:50:59.400
[somber music]

[engine starting]

871
00:51:51.120 --> 00:51:52.960
We lost Mom again.

872
00:51:53.630 --> 00:51:55.290
[sighs]
Yeah.


873
00:51:55.440 --> 00:51:57.420
She just wasn't ready yet,
that's all.


874
00:51:58.210 --> 00:51:59.920
Will she ever be ready?

875
00:52:02.140 --> 00:52:03.690
[he sighs]

876
00:52:03.790 --> 00:52:07.860
I don't know, Ash,
but right now,


877
00:52:07.960 --> 00:52:09.790
it's best that
she be near people


878
00:52:09.810 --> 00:52:11.460
who can take care
of her properly.


879
00:52:11.480 --> 00:52:13.540
I can take of her!

880
00:52:13.550 --> 00:52:15.390
I want to take care of her!

881
00:52:15.480 --> 00:52:16.980
I know you do.

882
00:52:18.540 --> 00:52:19.650
I do too.

883
00:52:21.060 --> 00:52:22.640
But first, Mom has to learn

884
00:52:22.660 --> 00:52:23.950
to take care of herself.

885
00:52:27.660 --> 00:52:29.330
Are you still mad at me?

886
00:52:30.160 --> 00:52:31.290
A little bit.

887
00:52:33.000 --> 00:52:34.150
But it's only because

888
00:52:34.170 --> 00:52:36.790
I don't want anything bad
to happen to you.


889
00:52:37.900 --> 00:52:40.170
I love you more than anything

890
00:52:40.320 --> 00:52:41.410
in this world.

891
00:52:41.510 --> 00:52:42.510
You understand?

892
00:52:43.990 --> 00:52:45.920
- I'm sorry, Daddy.
- Come here.


893
00:52:46.070 --> 00:52:48.140
- I'm sorry!
- It's okay.


894

Look, everyone, it's Donna Dean,

901
00:53:32.560 --> 00:53:35.380
world-famous bronze medalist.

902
00:53:35.400 --> 00:53:36.880
How'd you get in here?

903
00:53:36.970 --> 00:53:38.350
You didn't read the sign?

904
00:53:39.570 --> 00:53:41.720
"Professionals only."

905
00:53:41.740 --> 00:53:43.230
The exit's over there.

906
00:53:43.390 --> 00:53:46.630
I'm not going anywhere until you
agree to stop teaching Ashley.


907
00:53:46.720 --> 00:53:48.530
I'm Ashley's teacher, not you.

908
00:53:49.630 --> 00:53:51.740
Besides, I'm better than you.

909
00:53:51.890 --> 00:53:53.490
[laughing]

910
00:53:53.580 --> 00:53:56.660
Okay... prove it.

911
00:53:56.750 --> 00:53:57.820
You're on.

912
00:53:57.920 --> 00:54:00.250

[water bubbling]

916
00:55:00.650 --> 00:55:03.150
See? I am the best teacher
for Ashley.


917
00:55:03.300 --> 00:55:04.560
[Donna laughs]

918
00:55:04.650 --> 00:55:05.820
What is so funny?

919
00:55:05.970 --> 00:55:06.890
[Donna laughs]

920
00:55:06.990 --> 00:55:09.450
[tense music]

921
00:55:15.240 --> 00:55:16.580
What are you laughing at?

922
00:55:17.410 --> 00:55:18.500
You think you got fired

923
00:55:18.650 --> 00:55:20.740
because you weren't
a good enough teacher?


924
00:55:20.890 --> 00:55:23.840
It's because you wouldn't stop
hitting on Mrs. Scott's husband.


925
00:55:23.990 --> 00:55:27.250
- That's not true.
- Uh, yeah, it is.


926
00:55:27.340 --> 00:55:30.680
Mrs. Scott told me herself
the first day I was there.


927
00:55:30.830 --> 00:55:32.900
Yeah, well, did she also
tell you she's in rehab


928
00:55:32.920 --> 00:55:34.510
'cause she's walking around
drunk half the time?


929
00:55:34.660 --> 00:55:36.420
Oh, that's rich,

930
00:55:36.570 --> 00:55:38.570
coming from a pathological liar?

931
00:55:39.670 --> 00:55:42.080
You say you're training
for the Summer Games?


932
00:55:42.100 --> 00:55:44.100
You haven't even been
on Coach Sharky's team


933
00:55:44.190 --> 00:55:45.360
for over a year.

934
00:55:46.420 --> 00:55:48.360
Yeah, word on the street is

935
00:55:48.510 --> 00:55:51.180
you suddenly had to leave
'cause you kept hitting on him.


936
00:55:51.200 --> 00:55:54.200
You don't know anything!

937
00:55:54.430 --> 00:55:56.930
Maybe I don't know
exactly what happened


938
00:55:56.940 --> 00:56:00.350
because I wasn't there,
but here's my guess:


939
00:56:00.370 --> 00:56:02.190
You tried to hook up with him,

940
00:56:02.210 --> 00:56:04.880
but he told you to get lost,
and you didn't like it.


941
00:56:07.030 --> 00:56:09.170
That's it, isn't it?

942
00:56:10.780 --> 00:56:11.840
Isn't it?

943
00:56:15.390 --> 00:56:17.720
That's why they won't let you
on the national team!


944
00:56:17.870 --> 00:56:19.540
You got a reputation!

945
00:56:19.630 --> 00:56:22.950
Oh, Sabrina's a bad girl!

946
00:56:22.970 --> 00:56:24.640
Look, I loved Coach, okay?

947
00:56:24.790 --> 00:56:25.900
I loved him!

948
00:56:26.900 --> 00:56:29.130
And he was gonna ruin my life!

949
00:56:29.140 --> 00:56:31.400
I had to teach him a lesson,
I had to!


950
00:56:32.460 --> 00:56:34.070
You had to do what?

951
00:56:35.720 --> 00:56:37.070
Teach him a lesson?

952
00:56:38.640 --> 00:56:39.740
You're sick.

953
00:56:39.970 --> 00:56:41.990
I'm not letting you
anywhere near that kid


954
00:56:42.080 --> 00:56:43.140
or that family.

955
00:56:43.160 --> 00:56:44.920
I'm calling them right now.

956
00:56:57.600 --> 00:56:58.840

Guess you'll never get
the gold now.

[sighs]

969
00:58:25.020 --> 00:58:26.850
- Hey.
- Hey.


970
00:58:27.000 --> 00:58:28.690
[Sabrina] Been a couple
weeks since I saw you,


971
00:58:28.840 --> 00:58:30.190
so I thought I'd check in.

972
00:58:30.340 --> 00:58:31.310
[Parker]
Thanks.


973
00:58:32.100 --> 00:58:33.020
How are you?

974
00:58:34.030 --> 00:58:35.690
I heard the news about Donna.

975
00:58:35.840 --> 00:58:37.590
It's unbelievable.

976
00:58:37.610 --> 00:58:40.270
The police say she was taking
anabolic steroids,


977
00:58:40.420 --> 00:58:41.990
say her heart just gave out.

978
00:58:42.940 --> 00:58:44.430
How's Ashley taking it?

979
00:58:44.450 --> 00:58:46.110
Not well.

980
00:58:46.260 --> 00:58:48.370
She hasn't wanted to go
near the pool since.


981
00:58:48.520 --> 00:58:50.100
Look, if you think
it would help,


982
00:58:50.190 --> 00:58:51.530
I would be happy to come over

983
00:58:51.540 --> 00:58:53.440
and give Ashley
some catch-up lessons.


984
00:58:53.450 --> 00:58:55.950
I mean, if that's all right
with Ellen.


985
00:58:56.110 --> 00:58:58.110
Actually, it doesn't matter

986
00:58:58.130 --> 00:58:59.880
whether Ellen's okay with it
or not.


987
00:59:01.800 --> 00:59:03.200
She's back in rehab.

988
00:59:03.220 --> 00:59:06.800
What? She seemed perfectly fine
the last time I saw her.


989
00:59:06.950 --> 00:59:09.620
- What happened?
- I wish I knew.


990
00:59:09.640 --> 00:59:12.120
The thing is,
Ellen was always able


991
00:59:12.210 --> 00:59:14.570
to hide her problem really well.

992
00:59:16.740 --> 00:59:17.570
But this time...

993
00:59:19.800 --> 00:59:21.560
I don't know,
she must've gone on a bender.


994
00:59:21.570 --> 00:59:22.910
I've never seen her like that.

995
00:59:24.560 --> 00:59:27.080
- I'm so sorry to hear this.
- Thanks.


996
00:59:29.060 --> 00:59:31.250
Well, if you really have
the time,


997
00:59:31.480 --> 00:59:33.420
I'm sure Ashley would love
to see you again.


998
00:59:33.570 --> 00:59:35.810
I think some lessons from you
would cheer her up.


999
00:59:35.830 --> 00:59:37.250
And vice versa.

1000
00:59:38.500 --> 00:59:41.090
- This afternoon okay?
- Sure.


1001
00:59:42.340 --> 00:59:45.100
Great. I'll see you later.

1002
00:59:46.820 --> 00:59:47.600
[clicks]

1003
00:59:49.010 --> 00:59:50.270
[sighs]

1004
00:59:51.500 --> 00:59:52.660
Perfect.

1005
00:59:52.680 --> 00:59:55.770
[ominous music]

1006
01:00:04.510 --> 01:00:06.010
That's right, yeah.

1007
01:00:06.030 --> 01:00:08.030
Down kick, then keep
your legs straight,


1008
01:00:08.180 --> 01:00:09.290
then do the up kick.

1009
01:00:09.440 --> 01:00:12.350
[bright music]

1010
01:00:12.370 --> 01:00:13.790
Yeah, keep kicking around...

1011
01:00:17.040 --> 01:00:18.370
Nice, nice.

1012
01:00:18.520 --> 01:00:20.690
[splashing]

1013
01:00:20.710 --> 01:00:22.800
[indistinct]

1014
01:00:25.140 --> 01:00:26.470
[phone ringing]

1015
01:00:33.890 --> 01:00:35.770
[splashing]

1016
01:00:40.470 --> 01:00:44.550
Hi. How are you today?
Feeling better?


1017
01:00:44.570 --> 01:00:47.230
[Ellen] I... still don't
feel like myself.


1018
01:00:47.330 --> 01:00:48.230
Not even close.

1019
01:00:48.390 --> 01:00:49.230
[sniffling]

1020
01:00:49.330 --> 01:00:51.810
But I... I had to call

1021
01:00:51.830 --> 01:00:54.620
and see how Ashley was doing
after Donna...


1022
01:00:56.820 --> 01:00:58.890
I can't even bring myself
to say it.


1023
01:00:58.910 --> 01:01:02.170
Yeah, well...
Ash took it pretty hard,


1024
01:01:02.320 --> 01:01:04.080
so I decided
to bring back Sabrina.


1025
01:01:04.240 --> 01:01:06.680
I don't know what it is,
but those two have a bond.


1026
01:01:07.680 --> 01:01:09.570
Anyway, Ashley's smiling again.

1027
01:01:09.590 --> 01:01:12.500
I don't think it was a good idea
to rehire Sabrina.


1028
01:01:12.590 --> 01:01:14.310
I... I don't follow.

1029
01:01:15.910 --> 01:01:18.000
[Ellen] That day when
she brought over the beers,


1030
01:01:18.020 --> 01:01:20.420
she knew I was on the program.

1031
01:01:20.510 --> 01:01:22.190
You told her.
She didn't forget.


1032
01:01:22.420 --> 01:01:24.360
She...she brought those beers
on purpose.


1033
01:01:25.110 --> 01:01:26.700
You remember that

1034
01:01:26.850 --> 01:01:28.350
but you don't remember
passing out


1035
01:01:28.370 --> 01:01:29.930
in the middle of the day

1036
01:01:29.940 --> 01:01:32.040
with our daughter
in the pool by herself.


1037
01:01:33.100 --> 01:01:34.370
I don't know what happened,

1038
01:01:34.600 --> 01:01:36.020
but I swear,

1039
01:01:36.040 --> 01:01:38.710
I was not drinking that day,
I wasn't.


1040
01:01:38.860 --> 01:01:40.940
Instead of fixating on Sabrina
bringing over those beers,


1041
01:01:40.960 --> 01:01:42.360
why don't you come clean
about the fact


1042
01:01:42.380 --> 01:01:43.550
that you were drinking that day?

1043
01:01:43.700 --> 01:01:45.120
I wasn't drinking!

1044
01:01:45.220 --> 01:01:47.280
[intense music]

1045
01:01:47.290 --> 01:01:48.700
And I don't know what happened,

1046
01:01:48.720 --> 01:01:50.800
but I think Sabrina
did something.


1047
01:01:50.950 --> 01:01:52.610
Just like she did
with those beers,


1048
01:01:52.630 --> 01:01:54.780
she... she did something.

1049
01:01:54.800 --> 01:01:56.290
You're not making any sense.

1050
01:01:56.300 --> 01:01:57.560
[Ellen]
I can't remember.


1051
01:01:57.790 --> 01:02:00.140
- Yeah, because you blacked out.
- No.


1052
01:02:00.290 --> 01:02:01.960
Trust me, I swear, I...

1053
01:02:01.980 --> 01:02:03.230
[Parker]
I can't!


1054
01:02:04.130 --> 01:02:06.300
Sabrina is trouble.

1055
01:02:06.310 --> 01:02:08.150
She's the one who's lying.

1056
01:02:08.240 --> 01:02:10.390
Yeah, well, she's not the one
that left our daughter


1057
01:02:10.480 --> 01:02:11.890
in the pool unattended.

1058
01:02:11.990 --> 01:02:15.060
Baby, I...I swear. Please.

1059
01:02:15.160 --> 01:02:16.250
[Parker]
I've gotta go.


1060
01:02:20.750 --> 01:02:21.980
[sobs]

1061
01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:24.810
[Parker] You're teaming
up on me now, okay.


1062
01:02:24.830 --> 01:02:26.830
[laughter]

1063
01:02:26.980 --> 01:02:28.650
Can you come back tomorrow?

1064
01:02:28.670 --> 01:02:30.240
Oh, tomorrow, I don't know.

1065
01:02:30.340 --> 01:02:32.170
Let me... let me check.

1066
01:02:32.270 --> 01:02:33.750
[gentle music]

1067
01:02:33.840 --> 01:02:35.560
It's looking like...

1068
01:02:36.590 --> 01:02:37.660
I can make it.

1069
01:02:37.680 --> 01:02:38.990
Yes!

1070
01:02:39.010 --> 01:02:41.440
Can Sabrina stay for dinner
tomorrow night too?


1071
01:02:42.670 --> 01:02:44.920
Ash, we can't take
all of her time.


1072
01:02:44.940 --> 01:02:46.610
Why not?

1073
01:02:49.840 --> 01:02:50.860
[Parker]
We'll see.


1074
01:02:51.010 --> 01:02:53.180
For now, brush your teeth
and get to bed.


1075
01:02:53.190 --> 01:02:54.790
Only if Sabrina tucks me in.

1076
01:02:58.770 --> 01:02:59.790
Be right back.

1077
01:03:04.610 --> 01:03:05.800
[laughing]

1078
01:03:12.140 --> 01:03:15.030
Did your mom ever tuck you in
when you were a kid?


1079
01:03:15.050 --> 01:03:18.810
No. My mother
never really had time for me.


1080
01:03:18.960 --> 01:03:19.980
[tender music]

1081
01:03:20.130 --> 01:03:21.480
She didn't really love me.

1082
01:03:25.540 --> 01:03:26.650
What is it, sweetie?

1083
01:03:27.970 --> 01:03:30.710
I don't think my mom
loves me either.


1084
01:03:30.730 --> 01:03:32.900
[Sabrina]
Of course she does.


1085
01:03:32.990 --> 01:03:34.280
No, she doesn't.

1086
01:03:35.330 --> 01:03:36.550
She's never here,

1087
01:03:36.570 --> 01:03:38.220
she keeps making mistakes.

1088
01:03:38.310 --> 01:03:40.160
Ashley, we all make mistakes.

1089
01:03:41.230 --> 01:03:43.150
Your mom loves you,

1090
01:03:43.170 --> 01:03:44.500
and your dad does too.

1091
01:03:45.500 --> 01:03:46.990
Do you know how lucky you are

1092
01:03:47.010 --> 01:03:48.460
to have such a fantastic dad?

1093
01:03:50.830 --> 01:03:53.180
Last time I saw my dad,
I was five years old.


1094
01:03:55.070 --> 01:03:56.350
He used to take me swimming.

1095
01:03:57.520 --> 01:03:59.350
He and my mom
were always arguing.


1096
01:04:00.740 --> 01:04:01.690
He was trying his best,

1097
01:04:01.840 --> 01:04:04.860
but... it was never good enough
for her.


1098
01:04:05.920 --> 01:04:06.860
He couldn't take it.

1099
01:04:08.030 --> 01:04:10.920
One day, packed his suitcase,

1100
01:04:10.940 --> 01:04:13.990
kissed me goodbye,
and I never saw him again.


1101
01:04:15.370 --> 01:04:17.330
I think about Daddy every day.

1102
01:04:18.780 --> 01:04:21.710
I wish I could bring him back,
but... I can't.


1103
01:04:25.210 --> 01:04:27.710
Anyway, trust me.

1104
01:04:28.790 --> 01:04:30.710
Your mom and dad love you.

1105
01:04:32.780 --> 01:04:33.880
And so do I.

1106
01:04:40.630 --> 01:04:42.710
Good night, little dolphin.

1107
01:04:42.730 --> 01:04:44.640
Good night, big dolphin.

1108
01:04:44.730 --> 01:04:46.190
[laughing]

1109
01:04:59.250 --> 01:05:01.560
Let's see, all right.

1110
01:05:01.580 --> 01:05:04.870
We have candles...

1111
01:05:05.900 --> 01:05:07.070
That's for the diffuser.

1112
01:05:07.090 --> 01:05:10.750
Where's the diffuser?
There it is, okay, um...


1113
01:05:10.910 --> 01:05:14.500
Wait, you brought
all this here for me?


1114
01:05:14.590 --> 01:05:15.830
[mellow music]

1115
01:05:15.930 --> 01:05:17.150
Stress relief.

1116
01:05:17.170 --> 01:05:20.260
This stuff helps,
and trust me, you need it.


1117
01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:27.920
There is... one more thing
you should do.


1118
01:05:27.940 --> 01:05:29.900
[water splashing]

1119
01:05:41.620 --> 01:05:43.270
Doesn't this feel great?

1120
01:05:43.290 --> 01:05:44.460
It does.

1121
01:05:46.460 --> 01:05:48.440
You know, you should give
yourself daily swim breaks.


1122
01:05:48.460 --> 01:05:49.790
I mean, you clearly work out.

1123
01:05:49.950 --> 01:05:50.790
[chuckles]

1124
01:05:52.040 --> 01:05:53.590
Mainly weights and jogging.

1125
01:05:54.530 --> 01:05:56.450
Okay, so,

1126
01:05:56.470 --> 01:05:58.140
make swim dates
with your daughter then.


1127
01:05:58.290 --> 01:05:59.430
I bet she'd love that.

1128
01:06:00.790 --> 01:06:03.050
That was actually
my original plan.


1129
01:06:03.200 --> 01:06:04.640
Thank you for reminding me.

1130
01:06:09.220 --> 01:06:10.480
Race you to the other side?

1131
01:06:14.230 --> 01:06:16.300
[splashing]

[laughing]

1134
01:06:33.900 --> 01:06:34.800
Okay.

1135
01:06:36.400 --> 01:06:37.170
You win.

1136
01:06:38.180 --> 01:06:39.340
I'm no match for you.

1137
01:06:40.570 --> 01:06:41.680
I bet you could be.

1138
01:06:56.180 --> 01:06:57.190
Sabrina...

1139
01:06:58.360 --> 01:06:59.360
That's my name.

1140
01:07:01.020 --> 01:07:02.370
I forgot to mention...

1141
01:07:03.940 --> 01:07:05.700
this is the other way
to relieve stress.


1142
01:07:11.620 --> 01:07:12.540
[laughing]

1143
01:07:15.440 --> 01:07:16.860
[soft music]

1144
01:07:16.960 --> 01:07:18.620
You have to get up early?

1145
01:07:18.780 --> 01:07:21.050
No, I can sleep in.

1146
01:07:22.890 --> 01:07:25.560
- Good.
- Yeah, but this coming Tuesday,


1147
01:07:25.780 --> 01:07:27.850
I have to go to New York
for two weeks.


1148
01:07:30.140 --> 01:07:32.230
Yeah, lately I pay the neighbor

1149
01:07:32.460 --> 01:07:34.400
to look over Ashley
while I'm gone, but...


1150
01:07:37.460 --> 01:07:38.360
I'll do it.

1151
01:07:39.390 --> 01:07:40.360
You would?

1152
01:07:41.630 --> 01:07:42.860
You could stay here.

1153
01:07:45.730 --> 01:07:47.080
I would love that.

1154
01:08:00.760 --> 01:08:03.930
I've been reading a lot
about substance abuse.


1155
01:08:05.260 --> 01:08:06.260
Addiction.

1156
01:08:08.340 --> 01:08:11.180
Ellen, you, and Ashley
will be dealing with this


1157
01:08:11.330 --> 01:08:13.100
for the rest of Ellen's life.

1158
01:08:15.520 --> 01:08:17.070
[sighs]

1159
01:08:21.430 --> 01:08:23.360
You're always telling me
you have to think


1160
01:08:23.450 --> 01:08:27.620
about Ashley's future,
but... she deserves a mother


1161
01:08:27.770 --> 01:08:32.200
who's reliable,
who's gonna be there for her.


1162
01:08:32.350 --> 01:08:33.250
Doesn't she?

1163
01:08:36.520 --> 01:08:37.420
She does.

1164
01:08:38.950 --> 01:08:40.460
I could be that for her.

1165
01:08:56.460 --> 01:08:59.150
[Ellen] I don't even remember
how I got here this time.


1166
01:09:00.890 --> 01:09:04.660
But I do know...
I never want to be here again.


1167
01:09:05.570 --> 01:09:07.070
I love you all,

1168
01:09:07.160 --> 01:09:10.810
but... I miss my family,

1169
01:09:10.830 --> 01:09:12.240
and I want to go home.

1170
01:09:12.330 --> 01:09:14.500
[solemn music]

1171
01:09:14.650 --> 01:09:18.670
My name is Ellen Scott,
and I'm an alcoholic.


1172
01:09:18.820 --> 01:09:20.750
[applause]

1173
01:09:20.900 --> 01:09:22.060
Good job.

1174
01:09:22.080 --> 01:09:22.910
[sighs]

1175
01:09:23.070 --> 01:09:24.730
Vicky, why don't you go next?

1176
01:09:24.750 --> 01:09:28.180
Mm, sure, um...

1177
01:09:29.740 --> 01:09:31.850
I started drinking
when I was 12.


1178
01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:34.520
My friend invited me over
and her parents weren't home,


1179
01:09:34.750 --> 01:09:36.340
so we thought
that it would be cool


1180
01:09:36.360 --> 01:09:38.580
to drink some
of her dad's beers,


1181
01:09:38.600 --> 01:09:40.520
and then we drank some more.

1182
01:09:40.750 --> 01:09:44.010
It was fun,
and we just kept drinkin' 'em.


1183
01:09:44.030 --> 01:09:45.860
We turned on the TV,
and they were showing


1184
01:09:46.010 --> 01:09:47.260
that old movie, Jaws.

1185
01:09:47.270 --> 01:09:48.370
[dark music]

1186
01:09:48.590 --> 01:09:51.020
Okay, maybe some of you
don't remember it,


1187
01:09:51.040 --> 01:09:54.710
but it was about
this huge killer shark.


1188
01:09:54.860 --> 01:09:58.270
[voice echoing] Huge killer
shark. Huge killer shark.


1189
01:09:58.290 --> 01:10:01.380
Huge killer shark.
Huge killer shark.


1190
01:10:01.530 --> 01:10:03.100
[Donna] You were training
for the national team


1191
01:10:03.200 --> 01:10:04.940
with Coach Sharky
about a year ago.


1192
01:10:04.960 --> 01:10:06.610
- Wait, who?
- Coach Wallace.


1193
01:10:06.630 --> 01:10:08.700
Sharky is his nickname.

1194
01:10:08.800 --> 01:10:11.300
[Vicky] And it really gets me
because my niece is 12 now


1195
01:10:11.450 --> 01:10:12.560
and when I...

1196
01:10:12.710 --> 01:10:14.120
[Ellen]
Excuse me.


1197
01:10:14.130 --> 01:10:14.970
Hey, Ellen.

1198
01:10:15.120 --> 01:10:16.730
Hey, we're not done yet here.

1199
01:10:23.400 --> 01:10:25.550
Jerry, could I use my phone
for a minute?


1200
01:10:25.650 --> 01:10:27.070
Good afternoon to you too.

1201
01:10:27.220 --> 01:10:28.910
You know the rules:
Phone calls only


1202
01:10:29.060 --> 01:10:30.740
during scheduled times
with supervision.


1203
01:10:32.800 --> 01:10:34.470
It's my friend's birthday

1204
01:10:34.560 --> 01:10:37.490
and... last year I forgot it.

1205
01:10:37.640 --> 01:10:39.420
I just want to send her a text

1206
01:10:39.570 --> 01:10:41.250
and let her know
how much she means to me.


1207
01:10:43.500 --> 01:10:45.760
I just need a minute... or two.

1208
01:10:47.320 --> 01:10:49.050
I'll be standing
right here in front of you.


1209
01:10:51.580 --> 01:10:53.720
Two minutes. Go.

1210
01:11:03.520 --> 01:11:05.610
[phone ringing]

1211
01:11:07.780 --> 01:11:08.950
[Jerry]
Reception.


1212
01:11:10.620 --> 01:11:11.740
He's doing what?

1213
01:11:13.270 --> 01:11:14.120
Well, where's the...

1214
01:11:15.120 --> 01:11:16.450
Okay, you know what, never mind.

1215
01:11:16.600 --> 01:11:17.450
Coming up.

1216
01:11:19.850 --> 01:11:22.280
Lucky you, I got a situation
on the third floor.


1217
01:11:22.290 --> 01:11:23.630
You just bought yourself
two more minutes.


1218
01:11:23.780 --> 01:11:24.630
Thank you.

[phone dialing]

1220
01:11:32.640 --> 01:11:33.970
- Hello?
- Hi!


1221
01:11:34.810 --> 01:11:36.200
Coach Sharky Wallace?

1222
01:11:36.290 --> 01:11:37.530
[Coach Sharky]
Yeah, who's this?


1223
01:11:37.550 --> 01:11:39.790
Hi, my...my name is Ellen Scott.

1224
01:11:39.810 --> 01:11:42.040
I'm...I'm calling about a swimmer

1225
01:11:42.060 --> 01:11:44.040
that you coached last year,

1226
01:11:44.060 --> 01:11:46.630
a young woman by the name
of Sabrina Jameson.


1227
01:11:46.730 --> 01:11:48.820
[Coach Sharky] I can't discuss
my students with strangers.


1228
01:11:48.970 --> 01:11:50.150
- Goodbye.
- Hello?


1229
01:11:51.160 --> 01:11:52.160
Coach Sharky?

1230
01:11:52.880 --> 01:11:53.820
Hello?

1231

[Parker] You looking forward
to seeing Charlotte today?


1236
01:12:51.050 --> 01:12:53.200
That's why I love Saturdays
so much!


1237
01:12:53.220 --> 01:12:56.200
And her mom always makes us
popcorn when we watch movies.

[gentle music]

1239
01:12:58.630 --> 01:13:01.370
Hey, how would you feel

1240
01:13:01.390 --> 01:13:05.020
about Sabrina spending
a little more time with us?


1241
01:13:06.050 --> 01:13:08.060
You mean, like, moving in?

1242
01:13:08.960 --> 01:13:10.290
Not exactly.

1243
01:13:10.310 --> 01:13:13.800
You know I have to go
to New York in a couple of days,


1244
01:13:13.890 --> 01:13:17.150
so instead of dropping you off
at Mrs. Miller's,


1245
01:13:17.240 --> 01:13:20.060
I thought maybe Sabrina
could come stay here with you.


1246
01:13:20.080 --> 01:13:22.000
That'd be great, 
I love Sabrina!

1247
01:13:23.970 --> 01:13:27.420
Uh, then I guess...
Mom's not coming back?


1248
01:13:27.640 --> 01:13:28.480
[sighs]

1249
01:13:28.500 --> 01:13:30.000
Of course she is.

1250
01:13:31.500 --> 01:13:33.010
But I just don't know when.

1251
01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:36.240
Meanwhile, it might be nice

1252
01:13:36.260 --> 01:13:38.340
to have Sabrina around here
a little more,


1253
01:13:38.430 --> 01:13:39.990
if that's okay with you.

1254
01:13:40.080 --> 01:13:41.580
It's okay.

1255
01:13:41.680 --> 01:13:44.990
[Parker]
Good, but Sabrina


1256
01:13:45.010 --> 01:13:47.160
will never take the place
of your mom.


1257
01:13:47.180 --> 01:13:49.090
I just want to be clear
about that.


1258
01:13:49.180 --> 01:13:51.850
Dad, I know that.

You have fun. If you need
anything, let me know, call me.

- I love you.
- I do too!


1262

Let me get the door.

1263
01:13:58.770 --> 01:14:01.790
- Thank you, Dad.
- Thank you so much again.


1264
01:14:02.850 --> 01:14:04.600
All right, you ladies have fun.

[Sabrina] I stopped by
this super cute bakery


1271
01:16:01.800 --> 01:16:03.410
and picked up gourmet cookies
for everyone.

[Ellen]
Coach Sharky?


1273
01:16:12.990 --> 01:16:15.880
- Yeah, who are you?
- Oh, I...


1274
01:16:18.760 --> 01:16:20.500
I am sorry to bother you, but...

1275
01:16:20.650 --> 01:16:22.150
You're the one who called
earlier, aren't you?


1276
01:16:22.170 --> 01:16:23.760
Yes, but please let me explain.

1277
01:16:25.080 --> 01:16:27.320
A few months ago,
my husband hired Sabrina


1278
01:16:27.340 --> 01:16:29.340
to give our daughter
swimming lessons.


1279
01:16:29.430 --> 01:16:32.830
Sabrina said that she was
training for the Summer Games,


1280
01:16:32.920 --> 01:16:35.850
but later, I found out
that she wasn't


1281
01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:38.110
and she hadn't been for a year.

1282
01:16:39.780 --> 01:16:42.450
I am convinced that Sabrina
has been lying to us.


1283
01:16:43.840 --> 01:16:45.950
My husband doesn't think so,
but I do.


1284
01:16:46.770 --> 01:16:48.120
Please, can you help me?

1285
01:16:50.030 --> 01:16:52.030
[Coach Sharky]
I feel partially responsible.


1286
01:16:52.120 --> 01:16:56.920
I just... I didn't think
that she'd continue with the...


1287
01:16:58.630 --> 01:17:00.860
Continue to what?

1288
01:17:00.870 --> 01:17:03.210
Sabrina was one of my students.

1289
01:17:03.360 --> 01:17:06.040
She showed some promise
in the beginning,


1290
01:17:06.200 --> 01:17:09.360
but then she started
to have some issues.

[intense music]

1292

[Sabrina]
You're perfect for me.


1293
01:17:15.980 --> 01:17:17.560
You know how much I love you!

1294
01:17:17.650 --> 01:17:19.320
I've always loved you!

1295

[splashing]

1296
01:17:37.580 --> 01:17:38.840
You're the first person I told.

1297
01:17:40.080 --> 01:17:41.730
I didn't call the police
because,


1298
01:17:41.820 --> 01:17:43.580
even though she tried
to kill me,


1299
01:17:43.680 --> 01:17:46.340
I felt guilty
about kickin' her off the team.


1300
01:17:46.490 --> 01:17:48.760
I mean, I didn't want
to completely destroy her life.


1301
01:17:50.350 --> 01:17:53.090
You were a lot more generous
than I would've been.


1302
01:17:53.190 --> 01:17:57.810
Later, I found out that I wasn't
her first, um... obsession.


1303
01:17:58.860 --> 01:18:00.580
She has a thing for older men,

1304
01:18:00.600 --> 01:18:02.190
and if they reject her,

1305
01:18:02.420 --> 01:18:04.180
she freaks out
and tries to kill 'em.


1306

[dramatic music]

1307
01:18:06.850 --> 01:18:10.370
I think one of those older men
happens to be my husband.

01:18:17.210 --> 01:18:18.370
Listen to me carefully

1311
01:18:18.600 --> 01:18:20.210
and do not hang up.

1312
01:18:20.360 --> 01:18:21.940
What's goin' on?

1313
01:18:22.030 --> 01:18:24.110
You sound like you're in a car.
Where are you?


1314
01:18:24.200 --> 01:18:24.880
[Ellen]
That's not important.


1315
01:18:26.050 --> 01:18:27.960
I just talked
to Sabrina's old coach.


1316
01:18:28.050 --> 01:18:30.290
What? Why?

1317
01:18:30.390 --> 01:18:31.550
Why would you do that?

1318
01:18:31.780 --> 01:18:33.630
[Ellen] I remembered
something Donna said.


1319
01:18:33.780 --> 01:18:35.540
It came rushing back
to me today.


1320
01:18:35.560 --> 01:18:37.730
Sabrina stopped training
for the Summer Games


1321
01:18:37.950 --> 01:18:40.640
and had to suddenly leave
her team a year ago.


1322
01:18:40.730 --> 01:18:42.070
I had to find out why.

1323
01:18:42.220 --> 01:18:44.960
Sabrina told me she's been
training every single day.


1324
01:18:44.980 --> 01:18:46.630
[Ellen]
Yeah, well, she hasn't been.


1325
01:18:46.650 --> 01:18:48.980
Okay, well, maybe she said that
just to get the job.


1326
01:18:49.130 --> 01:18:50.910
One way or another,
Ashley can swim now.


1327
01:18:51.060 --> 01:18:52.320
[Ellen]
Listen to me.


1328
01:18:52.470 --> 01:18:54.730
Her coach said he had to kick
Sabrina off the team


1329
01:18:54.750 --> 01:18:56.400
because she kept hitting on him.

1330
01:18:56.410 --> 01:18:57.990
When he rejected her,

1331
01:18:58.080 --> 01:18:59.920
she tried to kill him!

1332
01:19:01.090 --> 01:19:03.160
Hello, did you hear what I said?

1333
01:19:03.260 --> 01:19:04.840
She tried to kill him!

1334
01:19:05.830 --> 01:19:08.500
I... I can't believe that.

1335
01:19:08.650 --> 01:19:09.830
Yeah, well, you better.

1336
01:19:09.930 --> 01:19:11.320
He wasn't the first one.

1337
01:19:11.410 --> 01:19:14.490
It's a pattern she has
with older men who reject her.


1338
01:19:14.510 --> 01:19:16.770
Be straight with me,
have you been drinking?


1339
01:19:16.920 --> 01:19:18.940
[Ellen]
I am stone-cold sober!


1340
01:19:19.830 --> 01:19:21.010
That's the other thing.

1341
01:19:21.110 --> 01:19:23.850
I remember that day now clearly.

1342
01:19:23.940 --> 01:19:25.830
I didn't drink anything!

1343
01:19:25.850 --> 01:19:29.340
Sabrina came over with
a box of cookies from Wilka's.


1344
01:19:29.360 --> 01:19:31.670
I had some, she didn't,

1345
01:19:31.770 --> 01:19:33.870
because she laced them
with drugs.


1346
01:19:34.860 --> 01:19:36.290
That doesn't make any sense.

1347
01:19:36.440 --> 01:19:37.770
[Ellen]
Yes, it does!


1348
01:19:37.860 --> 01:19:39.270
It all makes sense!

1349
01:19:39.290 --> 01:19:42.530
She drugged me
to get me out of the picture


1350
01:19:42.690 --> 01:19:44.960
because she wants
to get rid of me!


1351
01:19:46.690 --> 01:19:48.800
Okay, well, how do you explain
the bottle of whiskey I found?


1352
01:19:48.950 --> 01:19:50.190
[Ellen]
Sabrina put it there!


1353
01:19:50.210 --> 01:19:51.630
It had to be her!

1354
01:19:51.790 --> 01:19:54.800
Okay, I admit, I used to hide
bottles all over the house,


1355
01:19:55.030 --> 01:19:56.050
but, under the sofa?

1356
01:19:56.140 --> 01:19:58.550
Come on! That's for amateurs!

1357
01:19:58.640 --> 01:20:00.140
[doorbell ringing]

1358
01:20:01.890 --> 01:20:04.310
Hold on, someone's at the door.

1359
01:20:07.820 --> 01:20:08.820
[door opening]

1360
01:20:10.820 --> 01:20:11.820
Morning!

1361
01:20:11.970 --> 01:20:13.610
- Business call.
- Okay.


1362
01:20:15.050 --> 01:20:17.400
Listen, I...

1363
01:20:17.550 --> 01:20:19.570
[Ellen]
She's already there, isn't she?


1364
01:20:19.720 --> 01:20:21.650
Parker, she is dangerous!

1365
01:20:21.740 --> 01:20:23.390
She cannot be
around you or Ashley!


1366
01:20:23.410 --> 01:20:24.290
[Parker]
I have to go.


1367
01:20:31.330 --> 01:20:33.510
[birds chirping]

1368
01:20:33.740 --> 01:20:36.180
[grim music]

1369
01:20:49.530 --> 01:20:50.990
It's a beautiful pool, isn't it?

1370
01:20:52.260 --> 01:20:53.940
Yeah, it's perfect.

1371
01:20:54.030 --> 01:20:56.920
Ash and I are gonna have
so much fun swimming in it,


1372
01:20:56.940 --> 01:20:59.280
and even more fun
when you come back and join us.


1373
01:20:59.370 --> 01:21:02.040
Yeah, you know,

1374
01:21:02.190 --> 01:21:05.040
I'm not leaving
until Tuesday though.


1375
01:21:05.190 --> 01:21:06.380
It's only Saturday.

1376
01:21:06.600 --> 01:21:07.770
Oh, I know.

1377
01:21:07.790 --> 01:21:10.170
I just wanted to get
a head start, you know?


1378
01:21:11.200 --> 01:21:12.530
Learn my way around the house,

1379
01:21:12.550 --> 01:21:14.380
make sure I know
where everything is.


1380
01:21:15.290 --> 01:21:16.050
For Ashley.

1381
01:21:18.370 --> 01:21:21.450
By the way,
how's your training going?


1382
01:21:21.470 --> 01:21:22.730
You know, for the Summer Games?

1383
01:21:24.120 --> 01:21:25.790
- Great.
- I guess I should know this


1384
01:21:25.810 --> 01:21:27.730
by now,
but how often do you train?


1385
01:21:29.730 --> 01:21:33.310
- As often as I can.
- The reason why I'm asking is


1386
01:21:33.460 --> 01:21:35.310
I was hoping I could consult
with your coach


1387
01:21:35.470 --> 01:21:38.060
to see if I can get Ashley
into the accelerated program.


1388
01:21:38.150 --> 01:21:39.580
She's been doing so well.

1389
01:21:40.580 --> 01:21:42.250
I can look into that for you.

1390
01:21:44.140 --> 01:21:46.250
That might be difficult, though,

1391
01:21:46.400 --> 01:21:49.040
since you're not training
for the Summer Games.


1392
01:21:50.480 --> 01:21:52.420
I don't like when people
lie to me, Sabrina.


1393
01:21:53.760 --> 01:21:55.430
I'm not lying.

1394
01:21:56.590 --> 01:21:59.100
Good, glad to hear that.

1395
01:22:00.600 --> 01:22:01.930
I feel so much better.

1396
01:22:05.680 --> 01:22:08.000
Although, Ellen told me

1397
01:22:08.090 --> 01:22:10.010
that you brought over
a box of cookies.


1398
01:22:10.170 --> 01:22:11.440
She ate them and you didn't.

1399
01:22:11.670 --> 01:22:12.570
Why not?

1400
01:22:13.760 --> 01:22:15.260
I wasn't hungry.

1401
01:22:15.280 --> 01:22:18.510
I'm thinking you didn't eat them
because you put drugs in them,


1402
01:22:18.520 --> 01:22:20.600
and whatever you put in them
knocked Ellen out.


1403
01:22:20.620 --> 01:22:22.430
That's crazy!
Why would I do that?


1404
01:22:22.450 --> 01:22:24.950
So I would think Ellen
was drinking again, that's why.


1405
01:22:25.180 --> 01:22:26.770
And that bottle of whiskey
under the sofa,


1406
01:22:26.790 --> 01:22:28.250
I'm guessing
you didn't do that either?


1407
01:22:29.870 --> 01:22:31.350
Everything's going so well.

1408
01:22:31.450 --> 01:22:33.350
Why are you playing
this game with me?


1409
01:22:33.450 --> 01:22:35.190
Why have you been lying to me

1410
01:22:35.210 --> 01:22:37.540
from the moment
that you walked into my house?


1411
01:22:37.640 --> 01:22:39.380
You were never training
for the Summer Games.


1412
01:22:39.530 --> 01:22:40.450
You got kicked off the team

1413
01:22:40.550 --> 01:22:41.710
because you tried to kill
your coach!


1414
01:22:41.810 --> 01:22:43.120
That's not true!

1415
01:22:43.140 --> 01:22:44.810
Ellen tracked him down,
he told her everything,


1416
01:22:44.960 --> 01:22:46.530
so don't lie to me anymore,
Sabrina!


1417
01:22:46.550 --> 01:22:47.960
I wasn't trying to kill him!

1418
01:22:48.050 --> 01:22:49.960
He was trying to kill me!

1419
01:22:49.980 --> 01:22:53.870
I loved him, and he was trying
to walk away from me!


1420
01:22:53.890 --> 01:22:56.150
But that...that doesn't matter
anymore,


1421
01:22:56.300 --> 01:22:58.650
because I have you and Ashley.
Look...


1422
01:23:02.050 --> 01:23:03.280
We're a family now.

1423
01:23:11.390 --> 01:23:15.560
Sabrina, I don't know
what you're talking about,


1424
01:23:15.660 --> 01:23:17.920
but you need to go right now.

1425
01:23:18.070 --> 01:23:19.180
Go where?

1426
01:23:19.400 --> 01:23:21.330
I gave up everything
to be with you.


1427
01:23:21.350 --> 01:23:23.180
We're...we're gonna start
a new life together,


1428
01:23:23.330 --> 01:23:24.850
you, me, and Ashley.

1429
01:23:26.170 --> 01:23:27.930
I'm gonna say this
one more time:


1430
01:23:28.020 --> 01:23:29.410
You need to go.

1431
01:23:29.500 --> 01:23:32.430
But... but we're together now.

1432
01:23:32.520 --> 01:23:34.170
You...you love me.

1433
01:23:34.190 --> 01:23:35.530
Like hell I do!

1434
01:23:35.750 --> 01:23:36.680
Get out!

1435
01:23:36.770 --> 01:23:37.860
I'm calling the police.
