2
00:01:18.393 --> 00:01:22.475
HAPPY 80TH, DON HUMBERTO

3
00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:51.559
HAPPY BIRTHDAY

4
00:01:51.976 --> 00:01:54.892
I couldn't sleep last night.

5
00:01:56.685 --> 00:01:59.809
I was thinking and thinking.

6
00:02:02.393 --> 00:02:03.725
Alright...

7
00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.809
How do people see me?

8
00:02:10.143 --> 00:02:11.850
How do they see me?

9
00:02:13.893 --> 00:02:17.600
As a man who started from nothing

10
00:02:17.768 --> 00:02:20.725
and today is a leader
in the pharmaceutical industry


11
00:02:20.893 --> 00:02:24.309
and feeds almost 10,000 families.

12
00:02:24.976 --> 00:02:27.225
What do I care about that?

13
00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:30.434
I'll tell you how they see me.

14
00:02:31.601 --> 00:02:33.642
As a millionaire,

15
00:02:34.018 --> 00:02:36.309
with an obscene fortune,

16
00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:39.600
but with no prestige.

17
00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:46.767
Well, through your foundation
you've helped to set up projects...


18
00:02:46.935 --> 00:02:50.392
Everyone knows
what foundations are for.


19
00:02:50.726 --> 00:02:53.767
That building is practically unused.

20
00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:03.475
I've turned 80.

21
00:03:05.101 --> 00:03:07.934
I want to be remembered differently.

22
00:03:09.435 --> 00:03:10.892
I don't know,

23
00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:14.392
to do something that lasts.

24
00:03:17.893 --> 00:03:19.975
A bridge, for example,

25
00:03:20.268 --> 00:03:23.142
designed by a famous architect.

26
00:03:25.185 --> 00:03:27.309
A bridge with my name on it.

27
00:03:27.935 --> 00:03:31.725
To finance it,
then donate it to the State.


28
00:03:32.476 --> 00:03:36.059
The Humberto Suárez Bridge.

29
00:03:42.726 --> 00:03:45.809
Or if not, a movie.

30
00:03:48.185 --> 00:03:50.184
A movie?

31
00:03:53.726 --> 00:03:56.350
You want to direct a movie?

32
00:03:56.518 --> 00:03:59.684
No, you idiot,
how can I direct a movie?


33
00:03:59.851 --> 00:04:02.725
To finance a movie.

34
00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:04.725
To be the maker.

35
00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:07.809
So that people know I'm behind it.

36
00:04:09.518 --> 00:04:12.100
But not any movie.

37
00:04:12.518 --> 00:04:14.600
A great movie,

38
00:04:15.143 --> 00:04:19.184
with a great director,
famous actors,


39
00:04:19.351 --> 00:04:21.100
with the best.

40
00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:24.350
A movie.

41
00:04:31.018 --> 00:04:34.809
Yes, it's the best option.

42
00:04:37.185 --> 00:04:39.059
A movie.

43
00:04:40.185 --> 00:04:41.642
Sorry, excuse me.

44
00:04:42.643 --> 00:04:44.975
What would it be about?

45
00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:47.350
How should I know?

46
00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:05.017
Lola Cuevas, the director.

47
00:05:05.185 --> 00:05:06.767
She's the most prestigious now.

48
00:05:06.935 --> 00:05:08.684
She snaps up all the awards.

49
00:05:08.851 --> 00:05:10.517
Highly prized by the critics.

50
00:05:10.685 --> 00:05:12.392
She never grants interviews.

51
00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:15.309
She's kind of strange.

52
00:05:15.893 --> 00:05:18.767
Her films:
<i>The Inverted Rain,</i> from 1996.


53
00:05:18.935 --> 00:05:21.642
Her first work,
acclaimed around the world.


54
00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:25.184
<i>The Void,</i> 2001. Very weird,
not as celebrated as the previous one.


55
00:05:25.351 --> 00:05:28.267
<i>Haze,</i> 2015.
Considered her masterpiece.


56
00:05:28.435 --> 00:05:29.809
She's been waiting a few minutes.

57
00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:32.100
Remind me a bit about this project.

58
00:05:32.268 --> 00:05:34.684
It's all fine,
we have the book rights.


59
00:05:34.851 --> 00:05:38.600
-It was a tough negotiation, but...
-Sure, I found out what we paid.


60
00:05:38.768 --> 00:05:40.767
You asked me to prioritise it.

61
00:05:40.935 --> 00:05:44.267
One thing is prioritising,
another is getting fucked.


62
00:05:45.018 --> 00:05:47.559
But anyway, we've got it now.

63
00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:50.184
-Lola...?
-Cuevas.


64
00:05:53.726 --> 00:05:57.475
Iván Torres and Félix Rivero.
They're the perfect actors for this.


65
00:05:57.643 --> 00:05:59.934
They're being sounded out now,
and it's all go,


66
00:06:00.101 --> 00:06:04.475
despite loads of difficulties,
which was expected.


67
00:06:07.726 --> 00:06:10.225
They belong to different worlds.

68
00:06:10.393 --> 00:06:14.559
Iván is the master actor,
very prestigious,


69
00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:16.475
and Félix is...

70
00:06:16.643 --> 00:06:18.850
a worldwide star.

71
00:06:19.101 --> 00:06:22.267
I'm interested in that tension,
I think it'll help us a lot.


72
00:06:22.435 --> 00:06:24.309
And they've never worked together.

73
00:06:25.393 --> 00:06:26.892
I don't know...

74
00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:28.975
I want the best.

75
00:06:29.143 --> 00:06:30.267
Are they the best?

76
00:06:31.310 --> 00:06:33.392
Better, worse...

77
00:06:37.518 --> 00:06:40.184
wouldn't use those terms
to define an artist,


78
00:06:40.351 --> 00:06:42.309
but I get your question

79
00:06:42.476 --> 00:06:46.225
and the answer is yes,
they're absolutely the best for this.


80
00:06:46.393 --> 00:06:47.434
Excellent.

81
00:06:47.601 --> 00:06:50.600
-You really don't want any?
-No, you go ahead.


82
00:06:50.768 --> 00:06:55.267
Well, getting the book wasn't easy.

83
00:06:55.476 --> 00:06:56.850
But that's it.

84
00:06:57.601 --> 00:07:00.309
We have it, it's mine now.

85
00:07:01.310 --> 00:07:05.850
You know I'll do a very loose version
of the novel, don't you?


86
00:07:06.101 --> 00:07:08.517
It was the first thing I said
when they called me.


87
00:07:08.810 --> 00:07:11.559
But there will be
something of the book left?


88
00:07:11.726 --> 00:07:13.809
It cost me a fortune.

89
00:07:14.351 --> 00:07:15.350
Tell me,

90
00:07:16.726 --> 00:07:18.216
what did you think?

91
00:07:18.435 --> 00:07:21.559
It's meant to be good, isn't it?

92
00:07:21.726 --> 00:07:23.517
It's a Nobel Prize winner.

93
00:07:24.185 --> 00:07:27.184
I'd love you to tell me
what it's about.


94
00:07:27.351 --> 00:07:30.100
I haven't read it yet.

95
00:07:31.893 --> 00:07:34.642
I'm not much of a reader, actually.

96
00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:45.975
How do I tell you?

97
00:07:47.018 --> 00:07:49.142
<i>Rivalry</i> is...

98
00:07:49.310 --> 00:07:50.850
Alright then...

99
00:07:51.893 --> 00:07:53.725
It's the story of two brothers:

100
00:07:53.893 --> 00:07:57.767
Manuel is dull, introverted,

101
00:07:58.018 --> 00:08:00.142
and his brother Pedro,
his older brother,


102
00:08:00.310 --> 00:08:04.184
is very sure of himself, and rich.

103
00:08:07.018 --> 00:08:10.309
1970: a country town.

104
00:08:11.310 --> 00:08:14.142
Manuel is driving his parents
down a road.


105
00:08:14.310 --> 00:08:16.100
It's night and he's drunk.

106
00:08:17.101 --> 00:08:19.350
He loses control and the car
rolls over and over.


107
00:08:19.518 --> 00:08:21.309
I hate drunks.

108
00:08:22.185 --> 00:08:25.475
The parents die in the crash.
Manuel is unhurt.


109
00:08:25.560 --> 00:08:27.975
Pedro, the other brother,
reports him to the police.


110
00:08:28.643 --> 00:08:29.725
Well done.

111
00:08:29.893 --> 00:08:33.391
Then Manuel is sentenced
to several years in prison.


112
00:08:33.560 --> 00:08:35.934
Meanwhile, Pedro goes on
with his life


113
00:08:36.101 --> 00:08:39.934
and has a relationship with Lucy,
a whore at the town brothel.


114
00:08:40.310 --> 00:08:42.475
Everyone is suspicious
of Pedro's luxuries.


115
00:08:42.726 --> 00:08:44.434
He has a foundry,

116
00:08:44.601 --> 00:08:47.392
but nobody believes that
the money comes from there.


117
00:08:47.560 --> 00:08:50.475
Years go by
and Manuel gets out of prison.


118
00:08:50.643 --> 00:08:54.392
Pedro knows his brother is free
but they never meet.


119
00:08:54.560 --> 00:08:58.684
Until one day Manuel goes to
the brothel and sleeps with Lucy.


120
00:08:59.018 --> 00:09:03.017
His brother finds out, proposes to Lucy
and offers her a life of luxury.


121
00:09:03.185 --> 00:09:04.642
Lucy says yes.

122
00:09:04.976 --> 00:09:07.225
Manuel sinks into a terrible depression.

123
00:09:07.393 --> 00:09:10.309
Then he finds out
that Lucy is pregnant.


124
00:09:11.101 --> 00:09:14.392
He begins to wonder
if the child is his.


125
00:09:14.560 --> 00:09:16.017
The baby is born.

126
00:09:16.185 --> 00:09:18.392
But is it his or not?

127
00:09:18.851 --> 00:09:20.059
Wait, I'll go on.

128
00:09:20.310 --> 00:09:23.309
One day Manuel steels himself
and goes to Pedro's house.


129
00:09:23.476 --> 00:09:24.809
He knocks on the door.

130
00:09:24.976 --> 00:09:26.309
Pedro opens up.

131
00:09:26.560 --> 00:09:28.100
Manuel sees Lucy with the baby

132
00:09:28.268 --> 00:09:31.434
in a scene of devastating ordinariness.

133
00:09:31.685 --> 00:09:34.559
Manuel asks, almost begs
to talk to his brother.


134
00:09:34.810 --> 00:09:38.767
The brothers walk around
the estate at night, in darkness.


135
00:09:39.143 --> 00:09:41.184
Manuel apologises to Pedro.

136
00:09:41.351 --> 00:09:42.642
Pedro relents.

137
00:09:42.810 --> 00:09:46.100
The brothers embrace
and cry like children.


138
00:09:46.518 --> 00:09:48.100
Because men do cry.

139
00:09:48.810 --> 00:09:50.142
I love it. It ends well.

140
00:09:50.310 --> 00:09:53.309
I like the ending.
The brothers have reconciled.


141
00:09:54.018 --> 00:09:56.017
Wait, it doesn't end there.

142
00:09:56.185 --> 00:09:58.184
There's still the ending.

143
00:10:45.393 --> 00:10:48.017
OFFICIAL COMPETITION

144
00:11:44.601 --> 00:11:46.184
Take care of it!

145
00:11:48.851 --> 00:11:51.725
Maestro, we meet at last.

146
00:11:51.893 --> 00:11:55.392
It'll be a real honour
to work with you.


147
00:11:56.893 --> 00:11:58.059
Thank you.

148
00:11:59.851 --> 00:12:00.934
Let's go.

149
00:12:02.435 --> 00:12:03.767
Well...

150
00:12:04.060 --> 00:12:05.934
First rehearsal, eh?

151
00:12:06.185 --> 00:12:08.475
Good luck, pal.

152
00:12:08.643 --> 00:12:10.184
You'll need it.

153
00:12:11.893 --> 00:12:13.225
Sure.

154
00:12:13.393 --> 00:12:16.975
So will you.
Don't get too confident.


155
00:12:17.643 --> 00:12:18.475
Coats.

156
00:12:20.310 --> 00:12:21.517
Thank you.

157
00:12:21.976 --> 00:12:23.225
Go ahead.

158
00:12:29.185 --> 00:12:31.392
Look, there she is.

159
00:12:34.518 --> 00:12:36.684
Lola, good afternoon.

160
00:12:37.893 --> 00:12:42.142
I really rushed to finish it,
but it's turned out very well.


161
00:12:44.893 --> 00:12:47.309
A lot of work, loads.

162
00:12:48.685 --> 00:12:51.392
It ended up a bit bulky.

163
00:12:52.768 --> 00:12:54.642
With all my notes.

164
00:12:54.893 --> 00:12:56.309
I can't stop.

165
00:12:56.976 --> 00:13:00.434
How about we do a short exercise?

166
00:13:00.601 --> 00:13:01.559
Okay.

167
00:13:02.476 --> 00:13:04.892
How do you see your character, Iván?

168
00:13:07.601 --> 00:13:12.059
I've thought a lot about Pedro
all these months.


169
00:13:13.393 --> 00:13:15.392
I think Pedro's...

170
00:13:16.518 --> 00:13:20.100
driving force has been
to outdo his younger brother


171
00:13:20.268 --> 00:13:21.600
in front of their parents.
*


172
00:13:21.893 --> 00:13:25.350
So let's say that Pedro
has done everything right,


173
00:13:25.518 --> 00:13:30.100
he's always been steadfast,
secure, even with women.


174
00:13:30.935 --> 00:13:32.392
A football fan,

175
00:13:32.560 --> 00:13:37.100
a touch of the macho,
aggression, nationalism...


176
00:13:37.268 --> 00:13:39.642
He channels the primitive side,

177
00:13:39.810 --> 00:13:43.975
joining other primates
on the bleachers of the stadium.


178
00:13:44.768 --> 00:13:46.517
He gets up early.

179
00:13:47.185 --> 00:13:51.100
He's a simple, optimistic man.

180
00:13:51.268 --> 00:13:54.642
And I think that
he never wanted children,


181
00:13:54.810 --> 00:13:57.392
although he ended up
with one at this late stage.


182
00:13:57.560 --> 00:14:02.184
I love the idea of two brothers
forming a single entity,


183
00:14:02.351 --> 00:14:04.600
but split into two bodies.

184
00:14:04.810 --> 00:14:06.309
Look.

185
00:14:06.810 --> 00:14:09.767
They try to lead their lives
on different paths,


186
00:14:09.935 --> 00:14:12.934
but an unexpected event
puts them in opposition.


187
00:14:13.101 --> 00:14:13.684
Yes, yes.

188
00:14:13.851 --> 00:14:17.517
The fate of one is irrevocably linked
to that of the other.


189
00:14:17.685 --> 00:14:19.434
In fact, what happens to one,

190
00:14:19.601 --> 00:14:22.100
-happens to the other, right?
-Exactly.


191
00:14:23.685 --> 00:14:26.309
Félix, how do you see your character?

192
00:14:28.935 --> 00:14:32.559
Manuel, my character, doesn't exist.

193
00:14:33.018 --> 00:14:35.809
Pedro, his character, doesn't either.

194
00:14:35.976 --> 00:14:36.684
-Oh no?
-No.


195
00:14:36.976 --> 00:14:39.100
They're black ink on white paper.

196
00:14:39.518 --> 00:14:44.017
I don't need to know my character's past,
because he doesn't have one.


197
00:14:44.268 --> 00:14:48.684
I'll study the words and say them
with conviction and authority.


198
00:14:48.893 --> 00:14:52.225
That'll be enough,
the people will see Manuel.


199
00:14:58.268 --> 00:14:59.475
When you go to the doctor,

200
00:14:59.643 --> 00:15:03.017
you don't need him to tell you
his life story to believe him.


201
00:15:03.185 --> 00:15:06.392
If he has a white coat, a diploma
on the wall and a stethoscope,


202
00:15:06.560 --> 00:15:09.767
-to the audience he's a doctor.
-That underestimates the audience.


203
00:15:09.935 --> 00:15:10.600
Well...

204
00:15:10.768 --> 00:15:13.517
And it underestimates the actor,
it underestimates our work.


205
00:15:13.685 --> 00:15:15.142
-No, I don't think so.
-Yes.


206
00:15:15.310 --> 00:15:19.934
Anyway, I haven't argued about
these things for 30 or 40 years.


207
00:15:20.435 --> 00:15:23.809
You can never be so sure of
what the audience perceives


208
00:15:23.976 --> 00:15:26.309
about you or the character.

209
00:15:26.476 --> 00:15:29.600
There's an exercise I do
with my students.


210
00:15:29.768 --> 00:15:32.184
I tell them that when they're alone

211
00:15:32.351 --> 00:15:34.892
to call themselves out loud.

212
00:15:35.060 --> 00:15:39.892
For that very reason, to see
and feel themselves from outside.


213
00:15:41.310 --> 00:15:42.809
I know it sounds silly...

214
00:15:42.976 --> 00:15:46.684
-Sounds good.
-...but it's quite distressing.


215
00:15:48.893 --> 00:15:49.517
Iván!

216
00:15:52.768 --> 00:15:53.684
Iván!

217
00:15:56.601 --> 00:15:57.642
Iván!

218
00:16:04.351 --> 00:16:05.559
Iván!

219
00:16:09.393 --> 00:16:10.392
Oh, jeez...

220
00:16:10.643 --> 00:16:12.850
Poor kids, poor kids.

221
00:16:13.018 --> 00:16:16.350
I want to return to what you said
about the character,


222
00:16:16.518 --> 00:16:18.309
that he doesn't want children.

223
00:16:19.101 --> 00:16:20.850
I think it's a major detail.

224
00:16:21.101 --> 00:16:23.267
So do I, it is.

225
00:16:23.518 --> 00:16:25.684
-Do you have children?
-Yes.


226
00:16:25.810 --> 00:16:26.767
Five.

227
00:16:26.935 --> 00:16:28.809
-Five? All with the same one?
-Yes.


228
00:16:29.226 --> 00:16:30.975
All with this guy.

229
00:16:35.226 --> 00:16:37.361
Sorry, you gave it to me
on a platter.


230
00:16:37.560 --> 00:16:39.892
Yes, five with four
different women, yes.


231
00:16:40.060 --> 00:16:41.184
Do you have any Iván?

232
00:16:41.560 --> 00:16:42.767
Sorry?

233
00:16:43.018 --> 00:16:44.684
-Do you have any children?
-Yes, yes.


234
00:16:44.851 --> 00:16:47.059
One from my first marriage.

235
00:16:47.226 --> 00:16:49.767
He's grown up now, over 40.

236
00:16:49.935 --> 00:16:52.392
With Violeta,
we've been together for 28 years,


237
00:16:52.560 --> 00:16:54.309
we tried at the time,

238
00:16:54.476 --> 00:16:56.684
but now it's a little late.

239
00:16:56.851 --> 00:16:58.809
-I would have liked to.
-Okay.


240
00:16:59.601 --> 00:17:02.809
-Do you have...?
-No. Nor do I want to.


241
00:17:03.935 --> 00:17:08.059
I think an artist without children
has a huge advantage.


242
00:17:08.225 --> 00:17:11.017
You can create freely, without fear.

243
00:17:11.185 --> 00:17:13.184
With children, there's panic.

244
00:17:13.350 --> 00:17:16.599
People become conservative,
have no ideas. It's normal.


245
00:17:16.768 --> 00:17:19.349
With children to take care of,

246
00:17:19.518 --> 00:17:23.809
with the constant worry that
something bad could happen to them...


247
00:17:23.975 --> 00:17:28.934
it doesn't leave much room
to create anything risky, but anyway...


248
00:17:30.310 --> 00:17:33.975
Can you face me so that I can
see you better when we read?


249
00:17:43.143 --> 00:17:46.434
Well, Félix, we may have
different work methods,


250
00:17:48.351 --> 00:17:51.767
but we do agree on
the mediocrity of having children.


251
00:17:51.935 --> 00:17:54.392
-Shall we read?
-Yes, of course.


252
00:17:55.018 --> 00:17:56.017
Let's go.

253
00:17:56.518 --> 00:17:59.017
"Scene 1: interior, night,
Pedro's house.


254
00:17:59.185 --> 00:18:01.684
Pedro is told about the crash.

255
00:18:01.851 --> 00:18:04.017
The phone rings.
It's 11:30 at night.


256
00:18:04.268 --> 00:18:05.392
Pedro looks at the time and answers."

257
00:18:05.560 --> 00:18:06.767
"Hello."

258
00:18:06.976 --> 00:18:08.475
"A man's voice on the other end.

259
00:18:08.643 --> 00:18:10.934
Pedro knows it's a policeman.
He answers."


260
00:18:11.101 --> 00:18:13.100
"Good evening. Who is it?"

261
00:18:14.435 --> 00:18:16.184
Again, please.

262
00:18:16.476 --> 00:18:17.392
What?

263
00:18:17.935 --> 00:18:19.934
"Good evening". Again.

264
00:18:20.185 --> 00:18:22.767
-"Good evening."
-Once more.


265
00:18:27.226 --> 00:18:28.475
"Good evening."

266
00:18:28.643 --> 00:18:30.059
Once more.

267
00:18:32.685 --> 00:18:34.850
-"Good evening."
-Again.


268
00:18:38.101 --> 00:18:39.642
"Good evening."

269
00:18:41.226 --> 00:18:42.684
Once more.

270
00:18:47.018 --> 00:18:49.142
"Good evening." Do we carry on?

271
00:18:50.393 --> 00:18:52.684
No, because it's not right.

272
00:18:55.435 --> 00:18:59.392
You know that "good evening"
can mean many things, don't you?


273
00:18:59.560 --> 00:19:02.934
An invitation, an apology,
an attack, a thousand things.


274
00:19:03.101 --> 00:19:05.892
Here, this "good evening" must say:

275
00:19:06.060 --> 00:19:09.309
"What the hell's happened
for the police to call me


276
00:19:09.476 --> 00:19:12.309
at 11 o'clock at home?"

277
00:19:14.601 --> 00:19:15.850
All that?

278
00:19:16.101 --> 00:19:17.267
All that.

279
00:19:18.351 --> 00:19:20.767
You can do it perfectly well.
Let's go.


280
00:19:24.601 --> 00:19:25.725
"Good evening."

281
00:19:25.893 --> 00:19:27.309
That's it.

282
00:19:28.310 --> 00:19:29.434
That's it.

283
00:19:33.601 --> 00:19:35.767
"Scene 2: exterior, night, road.

284
00:19:35.935 --> 00:19:37.725
Pedro reaches the scene of the crash.

285
00:19:37.976 --> 00:19:41.392
An overturned car, an ambulance,
and his parents' bodies on the asphalt.


286
00:19:41.560 --> 00:19:45.600
Beside them is Manuel, kneeling,
crying desperately, a cop beside him."


287
00:19:45.768 --> 00:19:46.767
Pedro.

288
00:19:49.268 --> 00:19:51.017
Excuse me, Lola.

289
00:19:52.018 --> 00:19:54.017
A small observation on this text.

290
00:19:54.185 --> 00:19:56.059
Here the script says:

291
00:19:56.226 --> 00:19:59.642
"What happened?
What have you done, you fucking drunk?"


292
00:20:00.310 --> 00:20:02.600
I think Pedro should first just ask

293
00:20:02.768 --> 00:20:06.184
"What happened?", without the insult.

294
00:20:06.893 --> 00:20:10.059
I think it's better
if he's more restrained at first,


295
00:20:10.310 --> 00:20:12.267
trying to understand the situation.

296
00:20:12.435 --> 00:20:14.642
Later, yes...

297
00:20:15.018 --> 00:20:18.392
as he gradually gets angrier,

298
00:20:18.935 --> 00:20:21.725
he explodes at his brother,

299
00:20:22.351 --> 00:20:23.850
but not...

300
00:20:24.018 --> 00:20:25.642
What do you think?

301
00:20:28.018 --> 00:20:30.309
No, it's better to say it
as it's written.


302
00:20:30.726 --> 00:20:34.184
Let's go from where Pedro arrives
at the scene of the crash.


303
00:20:34.351 --> 00:20:35.350
Iván.

304
00:20:36.601 --> 00:20:40.350
"What happened? What have
you done, you fucking drunk?"


305
00:20:40.518 --> 00:20:41.934
"Sorry, sorry.

306
00:20:42.101 --> 00:20:46.017
Something ran in front of me,
a dog or whatever..."


307
00:20:46.185 --> 00:20:48.434
-Stop. Let's stop for a moment.
-Yes.


308
00:20:48.601 --> 00:20:50.934
-One crucial thing that you know...
-Yes.


309
00:20:51.101 --> 00:20:54.767
A drunk tries not to look drunk,
isn't that right?


310
00:20:55.018 --> 00:20:57.517
Even more if he's caused an accident.

311
00:20:57.685 --> 00:20:59.392
Then let's...

312
00:20:59.560 --> 00:21:01.309
How...?

313
00:21:01.685 --> 00:21:03.809
Imagine your level of drunkenness

314
00:21:03.976 --> 00:21:08.267
from 1 to 10, 10 being really drunk.
Try to give me a 3.


315
00:21:08.810 --> 00:21:09.809
Very well.

316
00:21:09.976 --> 00:21:11.142
A 3.

317
00:21:14.351 --> 00:21:16.684
Sorry, sorry.

318
00:21:17.685 --> 00:21:20.892
Something ran in front of me,
a dog or whatever...


319
00:21:21.143 --> 00:21:22.225
A 5.

320
00:21:24.060 --> 00:21:25.517
Sorry, sorry.

321
00:21:25.685 --> 00:21:29.934
Something ran in front of me,
a dog or whatever...


322
00:21:31.060 --> 00:21:33.600
A bit more, a 6.5.

323
00:21:37.518 --> 00:21:39.100
Sorry, sorry.

324
00:21:39.268 --> 00:21:42.767
Something ran in front of me,
a dog or whatever...


325
00:21:44.268 --> 00:21:46.142
That's it, Félix, right there.

326
00:21:47.518 --> 00:21:49.517
I felt it too.

327
00:21:50.601 --> 00:21:51.559
Yes.

328
00:21:54.768 --> 00:21:55.809
Did you see?

329
00:21:55.976 --> 00:21:59.350
Back into the brain,
no one can survive that.


330
00:21:59.601 --> 00:22:00.350
-Nobody?
-Nobody.


331
00:22:00.601 --> 00:22:01.684
I believe you.

332
00:22:01.851 --> 00:22:03.059
Alright, another one.

333
00:22:03.393 --> 00:22:07.142
Some guy comes along
and hits you square in the face.


334
00:22:07.310 --> 00:22:07.975
Alright.

335
00:22:08.143 --> 00:22:11.642
Because you stole his girlfriend
or he just doesn't like you.


336
00:22:11.810 --> 00:22:14.267
-For whatever reason.
-Okay.


337
00:22:14.425 --> 00:22:15.642
-Okay.
-Go.


338
00:22:15.810 --> 00:22:18.767
-Slowly first, right?
-Yes, in slow motion.


339
00:22:18.935 --> 00:22:20.309
-Go.
-That's it.


340
00:22:20.518 --> 00:22:24.225
Okay, now we use
the inertia of his body,


341
00:22:24.393 --> 00:22:26.142
to pull him forward.

342
00:22:27.018 --> 00:22:30.100
It's very simple, but it works.

343
00:22:30.268 --> 00:22:32.225
-It works.
-Yes.


344
00:22:32.393 --> 00:22:34.642
-Let's go.
-Good.


345
00:22:34.810 --> 00:22:37.934
Go on.
We'll do it a bit faster, okay?


346
00:22:42.435 --> 00:22:44.017
-Did you see?
-Can I try?


347
00:22:44.185 --> 00:22:46.142
-Go ahead.
-I'm going to try.


348
00:22:46.143 --> 00:22:47.809
Let's see if I can do it.

349
00:22:47.976 --> 00:22:49.309
Come on!

350
00:22:49.768 --> 00:22:50.850
Ready?

351
00:22:55.268 --> 00:22:56.725
At most,

352
00:22:57.185 --> 00:23:00.142
at most, one of you,

353
00:23:01.060 --> 00:23:02.392
only one,

354
00:23:03.143 --> 00:23:05.059
will finish this hard road

355
00:23:05.310 --> 00:23:08.767
and get to be a professional actor.

356
00:23:08.935 --> 00:23:11.017
One at most.

357
00:23:12.685 --> 00:23:14.975
So, if there's anyone here

358
00:23:17.185 --> 00:23:21.309
who's not absolutely sure
that they're this chosen one,


359
00:23:22.435 --> 00:23:27.184
I ask you, please, to leave the room
and not come back.


360
00:23:29.518 --> 00:23:33.059
The world needs engineers,
dentists, lawyers,


361
00:23:33.601 --> 00:23:36.184
people who turn the wheel,
labourers who work,


362
00:23:36.351 --> 00:23:39.892
but one thing it doesn't need
is more actors.


363
00:23:50.935 --> 00:23:52.934
Does no one have any doubts?

364
00:23:55.560 --> 00:23:56.434
No.

365
00:23:56.601 --> 00:23:57.684
Yes.

366
00:23:58.310 --> 00:23:59.642
Maybe.

367
00:24:00.185 --> 00:24:03.517
This guy is in every fucking movie
in this country. No.


368
00:24:03.685 --> 00:24:04.934
Maybe.

369
00:24:05.101 --> 00:24:05.934
No.

370
00:24:06.101 --> 00:24:07.184
Yes.

371
00:24:07.435 --> 00:24:08.100
No.

372
00:24:08.435 --> 00:24:09.100
No.

373
00:24:09.810 --> 00:24:10.350
No.

374
00:24:11.060 --> 00:24:11.642
No way.

375
00:24:12.018 --> 00:24:12.559
No.

376
00:24:13.060 --> 00:24:13.642
No.

377
00:24:14.726 --> 00:24:17.475
What a bland face. No.

378
00:24:18.601 --> 00:24:21.684
This cross eyed one, maybe.

379
00:24:22.101 --> 00:24:23.725
No.

380
00:24:24.560 --> 00:24:25.184
No.

381
00:24:25.810 --> 00:24:27.309
No.

382
00:24:27.643 --> 00:24:28.267
No.

383
00:24:28.768 --> 00:24:29.350
No.

384
00:24:30.143 --> 00:24:31.142
Yes.

385
00:24:32.268 --> 00:24:34.975
-Hey, he was a student of mine.
-Really?


386
00:24:35.143 --> 00:24:38.142
-Yes. Not much talent, poor guy.
-Then no.


387
00:24:38.310 --> 00:24:40.350
No, no, please, let him!

388
00:24:40.518 --> 00:24:43.184
You don't have to be a genius
to sit without saying a word.


389
00:24:43.351 --> 00:24:44.059
Take him, please.

390
00:24:44.310 --> 00:24:45.934
-We'll include him for you.
-Thanks.


391
00:24:46.101 --> 00:24:48.392
They are actors, aren't they?
I don't want any surprises.


392
00:24:48.560 --> 00:24:49.684
Yes, they're all actors.

393
00:24:49.851 --> 00:24:51.600
Poor guys.

394
00:24:52.601 --> 00:24:54.142
-I'd keep...
-Excuse me.


395
00:24:54.310 --> 00:24:56.267
Apologies for Félix's delay.

396
00:24:56.435 --> 00:24:59.267
He had to see the doctor,
but he'll be here in a minute.


397
00:24:59.435 --> 00:25:01.642
I warn you, he's
not in a good mood.

398
00:25:01.935 --> 00:25:04.475
I don't give a crap.
And who is this?


399
00:25:04.643 --> 00:25:06.309
Félix's errand boy.

400
00:25:06.601 --> 00:25:07.642
Come, come.

401
00:25:07.810 --> 00:25:08.559
I'll introduce you.

402
00:25:08.726 --> 00:25:10.767
Darío, Félix's personal assistant, Iván

403
00:25:10.935 --> 00:25:12.600
Iván, a pleasure to meet you.

404
00:25:12.768 --> 00:25:15.059
I'm a big fan,
I really admire you.


405
00:25:15.226 --> 00:25:17.225
Thank you very much.

406
00:25:26.310 --> 00:25:27.725
Rook!

407
00:25:28.476 --> 00:25:30.642
Rook!

408
00:25:30.810 --> 00:25:32.267
Cartagena!

409
00:25:41.435 --> 00:25:42.642
I'm ready.

410
00:25:42.851 --> 00:25:43.684
He's ready.

411
00:25:43.851 --> 00:25:47.809
The issue is what I do with
all these projectiles on me.


412
00:25:48.018 --> 00:25:50.767
You won't be doing this
before every take, will you?


413
00:25:51.143 --> 00:25:54.161
Hey, it's my method,
it works for me.


414
00:25:54.393 --> 00:25:56.600
-It disturbs me. Do it further away.
-Sure, sure.


415
00:25:56.768 --> 00:26:00.100
-And I assure you, it does no good.
-No, it does for me. Oh, yeah.


416
00:26:00.310 --> 00:26:01.517
Shall we begin?

417
00:26:02.351 --> 00:26:05.559
Remember, we're in the prison,
in the visiting area,


418
00:26:05.726 --> 00:26:08.600
with reinforced glass
between the two of you.


419
00:26:08.768 --> 00:26:10.350
-You talk on the phone.
-Okay.


420
00:26:10.601 --> 00:26:11.850
-Ready?
-Yes.


421
00:26:12.310 --> 00:26:13.725
Okay, let's go.

422
00:26:14.018 --> 00:26:15.100
Action.

423
00:26:18.143 --> 00:26:22.142
Mum and Dad would hate you
if they were alive.


424
00:26:22.310 --> 00:26:25.434
Don't even say their names!
You should've died in the crash.


425
00:26:25.601 --> 00:26:27.184
Okay, stop. Let's go back.

426
00:26:27.393 --> 00:26:30.767
Here, Pedro bangs the glass hard.

427
00:26:30.935 --> 00:26:33.309
He's very upset,
he starts to cry.


428
00:26:33.518 --> 00:26:35.142
Do it, please.

429
00:26:35.310 --> 00:26:36.475
What?

430
00:26:36.976 --> 00:26:38.059
Your actions.

431
00:26:38.226 --> 00:26:41.142
Do your actions.
Cry, I want to see it.


432
00:26:42.351 --> 00:26:45.517
There's no need,
I'll do it in the take.


433
00:26:46.185 --> 00:26:49.225
I can't cry gratuitously,
just like that.


434
00:26:50.018 --> 00:26:51.350
I've never been asked to.

435
00:26:51.476 --> 00:26:54.475
I have to be in the situation.
I have to be focused.


436
00:26:54.643 --> 00:26:56.934
But don't worry,
my emotion is on point.


437
00:26:57.101 --> 00:26:59.725
No, I'm not worried,
but I want to see it.


438
00:26:59.893 --> 00:27:02.142
Otherwise, I can't direct you.

439
00:27:02.685 --> 00:27:06.017
I don't need to do it
in a reading, frankly.


440
00:27:06.185 --> 00:27:09.434
The script says
that Pedro cries, right?


441
00:27:09.601 --> 00:27:10.309
Sure.

442
00:27:10.476 --> 00:27:12.309
-Well, how do we do it?
-That's...


443
00:27:14.060 --> 00:27:15.767
-Don't try to do it well.
-Okay.


444
00:27:15.935 --> 00:27:17.600
Find the truth.

445
00:27:21.518 --> 00:27:22.809
What are you doing?

446
00:27:25.476 --> 00:27:26.934
Crying.

447
00:27:27.476 --> 00:27:28.850
Weeping.

448
00:27:29.310 --> 00:27:30.642
Tears.

449
00:27:31.435 --> 00:27:34.184
Menthol. I always use it.

450
00:27:34.351 --> 00:27:37.392
Or do you need to remember
your dead grandma to cry?


451
00:27:37.560 --> 00:27:38.975
I don't know, eh?

452
00:27:39.226 --> 00:27:41.975
-You're not using that in my film.
-It works!


453
00:27:42.143 --> 00:27:43.834
Let's go again.
I'll watch from here.


454
00:27:44.018 --> 00:27:45.934
Let's go from "Mum and Dad".

455
00:27:47.351 --> 00:27:48.350
Action.

456
00:27:50.476 --> 00:27:53.225
Mum and Dad would hate you
if they were alive.


457
00:27:53.393 --> 00:27:56.517
Don't even say their names!
You should've died in the crash.


458
00:27:56.935 --> 00:27:58.100
Let it out, Iván!

459
00:27:59.101 --> 00:28:00.184
Hold on...

460
00:28:04.726 --> 00:28:06.475
Give me a break, man!

461
00:28:06.643 --> 00:28:09.184
-Why are you doing this? Why?
-Nothing happened.


462
00:28:09.393 --> 00:28:13.392
Don't be an asshole!
Look, blood. I'm bleeding!


463
00:28:16.643 --> 00:28:18.142
Are you all right Félix?

464
00:28:18.310 --> 00:28:21.225
Lola, Iván can't do this.

465
00:28:21.393 --> 00:28:24.809
This is my work tool, eh?

466
00:28:25.060 --> 00:28:28.892
This time I'll let it go,
but next time...


467
00:28:29.060 --> 00:28:32.059
I swear I'll smash
that fools face in, eh?


468
00:28:32.768 --> 00:28:35.059
When you get a film actor,

469
00:28:35.226 --> 00:28:38.517
don't get one who needs
this whole circus.


470
00:28:38.685 --> 00:28:40.059
Plus, he has an Argentinian accent.

471
00:28:40.226 --> 00:28:42.725
20 years in Spain
and he still has the accent.


472
00:28:42.893 --> 00:28:43.559
He has no accent.

473
00:28:43.810 --> 00:28:46.309
As if there weren't Spanish actors
who could play my brother.


474
00:28:46.476 --> 00:28:47.975
There must be a hundred.

475
00:28:48.143 --> 00:28:49.475
Come on, you still have time.

476
00:28:49.643 --> 00:28:53.017
Paco Carrasco.
A wonderful actor, wonderful.


477
00:28:53.726 --> 00:28:55.309
-Let's see...
-Yeah.


478
00:28:55.726 --> 00:28:58.142
Or Emilio Aravena..

479
00:28:58.351 --> 00:29:00.600
Emilio's very good too, eh?

480
00:29:01.893 --> 00:29:03.225
He's very good.

481
00:29:29.685 --> 00:29:31.975
-What are you doing?
-Nothing.


482
00:29:33.060 --> 00:29:35.142
Don't get side-tracked.

483
00:29:38.435 --> 00:29:41.517
I may have to call my lawyer.

484
00:29:42.976 --> 00:29:44.809
Come on, rehearse!

485
00:29:48.226 --> 00:29:49.559
He's all better.

486
00:29:49.768 --> 00:29:52.600
-By contract you can't touch his face.
-What?


487
00:29:52.768 --> 00:29:54.434
I thought you knew.

488
00:29:54.685 --> 00:29:56.684
Why would I know that crap?

489
00:29:56.851 --> 00:29:59.642
Is that true? It's extraordinary.

490
00:29:59.893 --> 00:30:01.392
It's pretty wild.

491
00:30:04.351 --> 00:30:06.309
Come on, let's act.

492
00:30:07.851 --> 00:30:09.559
Let's go.

493
00:30:11.476 --> 00:30:15.225
The link between these two brothers
is broken now,


494
00:30:15.435 --> 00:30:16.892
it has shattered.

495
00:30:17.601 --> 00:30:21.767
But something is still alive, okay?

496
00:30:22.560 --> 00:30:25.642
Let's work on that,
that impotence.


497
00:30:26.143 --> 00:30:27.809
But restrained, Iván.

498
00:30:31.685 --> 00:30:33.017
Let's go for it.

499
00:30:35.893 --> 00:30:37.142
Action.

500
00:30:40.476 --> 00:30:42.559
You're despicable.

501
00:30:43.768 --> 00:30:45.267
I'm your brother.

502
00:30:46.643 --> 00:30:49.059
I'm all you have.

503
00:30:52.143 --> 00:30:56.517
How can you live knowing that
you sent your only brother to prison?


504
00:30:58.685 --> 00:31:02.517
Leave that to me
and my conscience.


505
00:31:04.101 --> 00:31:06.309
You've only got two years left.

506
00:31:07.018 --> 00:31:09.559
For causing a massacre.

507
00:31:10.685 --> 00:31:12.059
It's nothing.

508
00:31:20.143 --> 00:31:22.725
Mum and Dad would hate you
if they were alive.


509
00:31:22.893 --> 00:31:24.475
Don't even say their names!

510
00:31:25.726 --> 00:31:27.475
Don't even say their names!

511
00:31:28.601 --> 00:31:32.225
You should've died in the crash.

512
00:31:33.310 --> 00:31:34.100
You.

513
00:32:09.310 --> 00:32:11.184
Very good, Iván.

514
00:32:13.143 --> 00:32:14.809
-Thank you.
-Very good.


515
00:32:21.185 --> 00:32:24.668
You don't have to smash
a chair to show anger.


516
00:32:24.886 --> 00:32:26.309
Sorry about that.

517
00:32:26.476 --> 00:32:29.309
We're not acting
for row 48 in a theatre.


518
00:32:29.476 --> 00:32:32.475
-You're right. A thousand pardons.
-Okay.


519
00:32:32.643 --> 00:32:34.142
-I don't know...
-It's fine, it's fine.


520
00:32:34.310 --> 00:32:37.309
-The tension... Forgive me.
-Forget it. It's over.


521
00:32:37.476 --> 00:32:41.267
Anyway, in the end
it turned out great.


522
00:32:41.435 --> 00:32:44.600
I'll tell you something.
I'm sure we'll make a great movie.


523
00:32:44.768 --> 00:32:45.767
I hope so.

524
00:32:45.935 --> 00:32:50.017
I can see us getting an Oscar
in the Dolby Theatre in Hollywood.


525
00:32:50.185 --> 00:32:52.142
Your speech in English.
You do speak English, right?


526
00:32:52.310 --> 00:32:53.767
-No, not at all.
-No?


527
00:32:53.935 --> 00:32:56.600
I'd never subject myself
to that circus.


528
00:32:56.893 --> 00:32:59.725
I don't want to be the Latino
who puts a bit of colour


529
00:32:59.893 --> 00:33:02.725
into that entertainment industry
for numbskulls.


530
00:33:03.476 --> 00:33:06.350
You go, you like it,
that's why you work...


531
00:33:06.518 --> 00:33:08.892
I won't say no.
Yeah, yeah, I'll go.


532
00:33:09.060 --> 00:33:11.059
-See?
-Yeah, sure.


533
00:33:12.601 --> 00:33:15.975
Hey, this wardrobe is great.

534
00:33:20.101 --> 00:33:23.475
Check out the lesbian-looking
eyesore outside.


535
00:33:23.643 --> 00:33:27.059
I bet you 100 euros
she's one of Lola's girlfriends.


536
00:33:27.226 --> 00:33:28.392
Done.

537
00:33:33.393 --> 00:33:36.600
Félix, this is Violeta, my wife.

538
00:33:38.393 --> 00:33:39.850
Nice to meet you.

539
00:33:40.018 --> 00:33:42.267
-Charmed.
-Nice to meet you.


540
00:33:43.435 --> 00:33:46.350
Félix, I'd like to give you
my latest book.


541
00:33:47.018 --> 00:33:49.225
She writes children's stories.

542
00:33:49.560 --> 00:33:53.142
I'm sure you've heard her name.
Violeta Valderrobles.


543
00:33:54.351 --> 00:33:57.934
She's famous in the circle
of children's writers.


544
00:33:59.476 --> 00:34:02.517
It's the story of a special child,
an immigrant


545
00:34:02.685 --> 00:34:05.350
who lives on the street
and turns junk objects


546
00:34:05.601 --> 00:34:09.142
into imaginary treasures
that teach him something.


547
00:34:09.310 --> 00:34:11.100
Don't tell him the whole book.

548
00:34:11.268 --> 00:34:12.934
It's a metaphor.

549
00:34:13.101 --> 00:34:15.767
It's a call to all of us,

550
00:34:15.935 --> 00:34:19.017
men, women, the genderless,

551
00:34:19.268 --> 00:34:22.392
to live in a state
of permanent poetry,


552
00:34:22.768 --> 00:34:26.225
against this ever more hostile, sick

553
00:34:26.726 --> 00:34:29.434
and unjust world we live in.

554
00:34:30.851 --> 00:34:33.017
I love it. Thanks a lot.

555
00:34:33.185 --> 00:34:36.142
How do you know you love it
if you haven't read it yet?


556
00:34:36.435 --> 00:34:38.975
From what she told me.

557
00:34:39.601 --> 00:34:41.975
-It looks great.
-Thank you.


558
00:34:42.226 --> 00:34:44.392
And it only cost you 100 euros.

559
00:34:44.810 --> 00:34:45.559
Why?

560
00:34:45.726 --> 00:34:46.809
Shall we go?

561
00:34:46.976 --> 00:34:50.850
<i>Did you know that the pink dolphin
is in serious danger of extinction?</i>


562
00:34:51.310 --> 00:34:55.475
<i>This marvellous animal has been
devastated by the deeds of man</i>


563
00:34:55.726 --> 00:34:57.392
<i>and it needs our help.</i>

564
00:34:57.726 --> 00:34:59.850
<i>The pink dolphin has no voice.</i>

565
00:35:00.018 --> 00:35:01.975
<i>Today I am its voice</i>

566
00:35:02.143 --> 00:35:04.434
<i>and I say: it needs your help.</i>

567
00:35:04.601 --> 00:35:07.059
-How pathetic. Please...
<i>-I need one euro.</i>


568
00:35:07.226 --> 00:35:09.350
<i>With your contribution we can...</i>

569
00:35:09.518 --> 00:35:12.600
Lola, excuse me,
the crane is ready on the terrace.


570
00:35:13.018 --> 00:35:17.184
Félix will be late.
In case you want to entertain Iván.


571
00:35:17.351 --> 00:35:18.392
Coming.

572
00:35:18.976 --> 00:35:21.225
You must see this Félix thing.

573
00:35:21.393 --> 00:35:22.684
It's dreadful.

574
00:35:22.851 --> 00:35:26.975
<i>Did you know that the pink dolphin
is in serious danger of extinction?</i>


575
00:35:27.310 --> 00:35:31.434
<i>This marvellous animal has been
devastated by the deeds of man</i>


576
00:35:31.601 --> 00:35:34.517
<i>and it needs our help.</i>

577
00:35:36.935 --> 00:35:39.100
I'll speak in Spanish.

578
00:35:39.601 --> 00:35:43.767
I must say that when I was
nominated for this award,


579
00:35:43.976 --> 00:35:46.934
my first impression was distaste.

580
00:35:47.101 --> 00:35:49.892
I wasn't going to come, frankly,
but then...


581
00:35:50.893 --> 00:35:53.517
my family and friends
made me realize that


582
00:35:54.060 --> 00:35:58.392
it was important to be here
to say what I think.


583
00:35:58.560 --> 00:36:03.225
That's why I'm here before you,
to lay out my position.


584
00:36:03.726 --> 00:36:05.434
I don't believe in art as spectacle

585
00:36:05.601 --> 00:36:08.642
and much less
in what they call success.


586
00:36:09.393 --> 00:36:13.809
Making art compete
as if it were a sports event,


587
00:36:14.518 --> 00:36:16.100
I think is atrocious.

588
00:36:17.601 --> 00:36:20.725
Why then have I come?

589
00:36:21.310 --> 00:36:23.225
I've come...

590
00:36:23.685 --> 00:36:28.059
to formally declare
my rejection of this award.


591
00:36:30.476 --> 00:36:31.934
Thank you very much.

592
00:36:33.101 --> 00:36:34.850
And good night.

593
00:36:50.768 --> 00:36:51.767
Hello.

594
00:36:57.268 --> 00:36:58.559
What's this?

595
00:36:58.893 --> 00:37:02.059
This is about including
an external element


596
00:37:02.310 --> 00:37:05.309
that increases the tension,
increases the fear.


597
00:37:05.935 --> 00:37:09.309
It also symbolises the pressure
these two wretches live under,


598
00:37:09.476 --> 00:37:10.517
the weight of the law.

599
00:37:10.685 --> 00:37:12.517
I don't need that.

600
00:37:12.976 --> 00:37:15.225
It's not a need Iván,

601
00:37:15.393 --> 00:37:16.850
it's an exercise.

602
00:37:17.643 --> 00:37:20.100
Come on, it's only 5 tons.

603
00:37:20.268 --> 00:37:21.850
Is this safe?

604
00:37:24.101 --> 00:37:25.684
Are we ready?

605
00:37:31.726 --> 00:37:34.600
Remember, you're talking to a judge.

606
00:37:37.185 --> 00:37:40.267
That image will haunt me
my whole life.


607
00:37:40.435 --> 00:37:42.184
Memories of horror.

608
00:37:42.393 --> 00:37:44.975
Mum and Dad stretched out.

609
00:37:45.560 --> 00:37:47.475
In shock, deep shock.

610
00:37:47.643 --> 00:37:50.267
...amid glass and blood...

611
00:37:50.435 --> 00:37:51.600
Now you hate him!

612
00:37:51.768 --> 00:37:54.892
...and Manuel kneeling on
the asphalt, drunk...


613
00:37:55.039 --> 00:37:56.273
Sentence!

614
00:37:57.601 --> 00:38:00.017
I didn't see my brother,
I saw my parents' killer.


615
00:38:00.185 --> 00:38:03.642
-Less Iván. Relax!
-Sure, "relax", Lola, but with this...


616
00:38:03.810 --> 00:38:05.309
Don't cut!

617
00:38:07.768 --> 00:38:09.267
Let's go again.

618
00:38:09.851 --> 00:38:12.059
From "I didn't see my brother".

619
00:38:12.473 --> 00:38:13.549
Action.

620
00:38:13.810 --> 00:38:16.517
I didn't see my brother,
I saw my parents' killer.


621
00:38:17.185 --> 00:38:18.284
Less.

622
00:38:20.268 --> 00:38:22.975
I didn't see my brother,
I saw my parents' killer.


623
00:38:23.117 --> 00:38:25.114
-Less.
-But...


624
00:38:25.310 --> 00:38:28.267
If I do any less,
I'll be doing nothing, Lola.


625
00:38:28.435 --> 00:38:29.850
That's the idea.

626
00:38:32.476 --> 00:38:34.559
-Alright, Félix...
-Yeah, yeah.


627
00:38:35.476 --> 00:38:37.725
-Use it, use it.
-Yeah, yeah.


628
00:38:38.101 --> 00:38:40.600
-You're terrified of the judge.
-Yes, the judge.


629
00:38:40.717 --> 00:38:42.019
Let's go.

630
00:38:44.893 --> 00:38:48.309
I bear the harshest sentence,

631
00:38:49.110 --> 00:38:49.999
the guilt...

632
00:38:50.185 --> 00:38:52.309
-From here, from the heart.
-Yeah, yeah.


633
00:38:52.476 --> 00:38:53.850
Say it from here.

634
00:38:54.018 --> 00:38:57.434
I would rather have died

635
00:38:57.893 --> 00:38:59.142
and they lived.

636
00:38:59.351 --> 00:39:00.809
-Fake, I don't believe it.
-No.


637
00:39:00.976 --> 00:39:03.517
Truth, I want the truth.

638
00:39:04.283 --> 00:39:05.813
Something...

639
00:39:06.268 --> 00:39:09.475
ran in front of me,
I think it was an animal or...


640
00:39:09.592 --> 00:39:11.062
Resigned.

641
00:39:11.992 --> 00:39:13.662
An accident.

642
00:39:14.310 --> 00:39:16.392
An accident I couldn't prevent.

643
00:39:16.560 --> 00:39:18.767
Again. Resigned and disillusioned.

644
00:39:18.935 --> 00:39:20.850
Disillusioned. Right.

645
00:39:23.393 --> 00:39:26.600
An accident I couldn't prevent.

646
00:39:27.185 --> 00:39:30.100
Resigned, disillusioned
and distressed.


647
00:39:31.851 --> 00:39:34.934
An accident I couldn't prevent.

648
00:39:35.935 --> 00:39:38.934
-That's it.
- Yes, I...


649
00:39:39.101 --> 00:39:41.100
That's the way, guys.

650
00:39:41.476 --> 00:39:43.642
I promise to shut up.

651
00:39:43.792 --> 00:39:45.231
It's all yours.

652
00:39:45.361 --> 00:39:46.397
Action.

653
00:39:48.018 --> 00:39:51.642
We've done three rehearsals.
Six to go.


654
00:39:51.893 --> 00:39:55.975
I never understood that.
Nine seemed like very few.


655
00:39:56.518 --> 00:40:00.225
Sorry, it's the best I can do
with my schedule.


656
00:40:00.393 --> 00:40:01.684
Sure, but...

657
00:40:02.393 --> 00:40:05.392
You always have to rehearse
according to what the work requires.


658
00:40:07.226 --> 00:40:10.809
Sometimes rehearsing too much
can overcook the thing.


659
00:40:10.976 --> 00:40:13.600
Too much, no, what's necessary.

660
00:40:13.768 --> 00:40:15.559
Don't worry about it.

661
00:40:15.726 --> 00:40:18.725
We're rehearsing for nine days
because that's enough.


662
00:40:19.018 --> 00:40:21.684
Lola, sorry, you've finished
with the rock, haven't you?


663
00:40:36.351 --> 00:40:39.059
-But...
-Guys, you're so gullible.


664
00:40:39.226 --> 00:40:40.725
It's cardboard.

665
00:40:41.476 --> 00:40:42.559
-Ready?
-Got it.


666
00:40:42.726 --> 00:40:44.600
-Straight to Instagram, eh?
-Yeah, yeah.


667
00:40:44.768 --> 00:40:45.767
Let's go.

668
00:40:47.810 --> 00:40:49.475
Go, go.

669
00:40:51.643 --> 00:40:53.684
What a wanker.

670
00:41:16.518 --> 00:41:18.059
I'm sorry.

671
00:41:18.226 --> 00:41:20.350
It all got terribly complicated.

672
00:41:20.518 --> 00:41:21.434
The third time.

673
00:41:21.601 --> 00:41:24.642
Lola, Diana is coming,
but she's with Mr Suárez.


674
00:41:24.810 --> 00:41:25.809
You don't say.

675
00:41:25.976 --> 00:41:29.434
And to what do we owe
the visit from our producer?


676
00:41:29.601 --> 00:41:33.267
He's bringing his daughter Diana.
I told you she's playing the role of Lucy.


677
00:41:33.435 --> 00:41:35.725
That was true?
I thought it was a joke.


678
00:41:35.893 --> 00:41:39.809
He asked me, I did loads of tests
and the girl's great,


679
00:41:39.976 --> 00:41:41.059
very special.

680
00:41:42.351 --> 00:41:46.975
Diana, your character doesn't
have any particular interest.


681
00:41:47.226 --> 00:41:49.475
She's in her place,
she goes with the flow.


682
00:41:49.643 --> 00:41:52.517
They're the ones
with the conflict. Alright?


683
00:41:52.687 --> 00:41:53.559
Okay.

684
00:41:53.726 --> 00:41:57.309
I'd like to see the stamp of
Pedro and Manuel's personalities


685
00:41:57.518 --> 00:41:58.575
through the kiss,

686
00:41:58.769 --> 00:42:00.809
how they kiss Lucy,

687
00:42:01.060 --> 00:42:03.767
their individual approach.

688
00:42:04.226 --> 00:42:06.475
-Do you want to start?
-Right away.


689
00:42:09.435 --> 00:42:10.934
Right, let's go.

690
00:42:13.393 --> 00:42:15.350
Put the headphones on.

691
00:42:15.518 --> 00:42:17.392
The sound is key here.

692
00:42:19.851 --> 00:42:20.767
Hello.

693
00:42:20.935 --> 00:42:22.059
Listen...

694
00:42:22.226 --> 00:42:24.934
Sorry if I have an erection.

695
00:42:25.310 --> 00:42:29.309
And sorry if I don't,
it's nothing personal.


696
00:42:30.185 --> 00:42:32.767
-Okay. Ready?
-Yeah, yeah.


697
00:42:34.643 --> 00:42:35.767
Action.

698
00:43:18.310 --> 00:43:19.975
Okay, okay, okay.

699
00:43:21.018 --> 00:43:22.934
Thank you, Félix.

700
00:43:23.310 --> 00:43:25.559
Iván, shall we go with you?

701
00:43:27.726 --> 00:43:29.642
Good luck, champ.

702
00:43:34.476 --> 00:43:36.184
Okay, let's go.

703
00:43:37.143 --> 00:43:38.350
Forgive me.

704
00:43:57.810 --> 00:43:58.725
Okay, okay, okay.

705
00:43:58.893 --> 00:44:01.809
The poor guy's been married
for 28 years to the same woman,


706
00:44:01.976 --> 00:44:04.059
you can tell that.

707
00:44:04.935 --> 00:44:07.725
Don't you laugh,
you don't convey much either.


708
00:44:07.893 --> 00:44:11.684
I have 13 international awards, eh?
I must convey something.


709
00:44:11.976 --> 00:44:12.809
Just saying.

710
00:44:13.060 --> 00:44:15.767
Oh, sure, the awards.
Yes, that's so important.


711
00:44:15.935 --> 00:44:19.434
Guys, I'll show you something,
with Diana's permission.


712
00:44:23.601 --> 00:44:24.767
Do you mind?

713
00:44:27.976 --> 00:44:29.059
Look.

714
00:45:41.018 --> 00:45:43.210
I forgot something at work.

715
00:45:43.412 --> 00:45:44.934
I have to go.

716
00:45:45.643 --> 00:45:47.559
It's all fantastic.

717
00:45:50.810 --> 00:45:52.017
My girl...

718
00:45:52.351 --> 00:45:53.517
Excellent.

719
00:45:54.435 --> 00:45:57.350
Tell me about it later.

720
00:46:02.935 --> 00:46:05.267
So the idea is to fly
on Tuesday the 21st.


721
00:46:05.476 --> 00:46:06.850
In the morning, early.

722
00:46:08.143 --> 00:46:09.142
Excuse me.

723
00:46:10.310 --> 00:46:11.642
Lola, yes?

724
00:46:12.560 --> 00:46:13.559
Yes.

725
00:46:15.018 --> 00:46:16.309
Fine, I'll put it on speaker.

726
00:46:16.601 --> 00:46:18.184
It's Lola.

727
00:46:19.435 --> 00:46:21.392
<i>Hi, guys, how are you?</i>

728
00:46:21.560 --> 00:46:23.684
<i>I wanted to ask you a favour.</i>

729
00:46:23.851 --> 00:46:28.059
<i>Maybe the next day you could
bring some of your awards.</i>


730
00:46:29.851 --> 00:46:32.184
Hi, Lola, it's Félix.

731
00:46:32.351 --> 00:46:35.142
Do you mean the trophies,
the statues?


732
00:46:35.310 --> 00:46:39.767
<i>Yes, some of the 35 you said.
Whatever's easy.</i>


733
00:46:41.310 --> 00:46:44.225
<i>We'll be doing an exercise
with them, okay?</i>


734
00:46:44.393 --> 00:46:45.934
-Okay.
-Great. See you later.


735
00:46:46.185 --> 00:46:47.392
<i>See you later. Great.</i>

736
00:46:47.560 --> 00:46:49.309
Good, let's resume.

737
00:46:49.726 --> 00:46:52.892
I was saying that we'd leave
early on the 21st


738
00:46:53.060 --> 00:46:54.850
and we'd be just over a week

739
00:46:55.018 --> 00:46:58.309
until the final scenes
and some exteriors.


740
00:46:58.518 --> 00:47:01.184
-Exactly seven working days.
-Yes, as long as it doesn't rain.


741
00:47:01.393 --> 00:47:04.434
One thing.
When I travel, I always get


742
00:47:04.768 --> 00:47:08.642
the cheapest ticket,
never first class.


743
00:47:08.976 --> 00:47:11.142
Take that into account, please.
It's important.


744
00:47:11.310 --> 00:47:12.309
Why?

745
00:47:12.476 --> 00:47:14.017
It's an ethical question.

746
00:47:14.268 --> 00:47:15.350
Ethical?

747
00:47:15.518 --> 00:47:18.892
I hate being forced
to have privileges.


748
00:47:19.101 --> 00:47:22.184
Besides, when I get on the plane
and pass through first class,


749
00:47:22.351 --> 00:47:26.850
I check out the turd
and shitbird faces up front.


750
00:47:27.226 --> 00:47:30.059
Iván, I like you more every day.

751
00:47:31.060 --> 00:47:33.309
-I have to go. I have classes.
-Fine.


752
00:47:39.060 --> 00:47:42.892
Sorry I'd like to comment
briefly on Félix's food.


753
00:47:43.060 --> 00:47:44.142
Let's see...

754
00:47:44.351 --> 00:47:46.892
It has to be macrobiotic,
ecological,


755
00:47:47.060 --> 00:47:49.517
gluten-free, all made in Spain.

756
00:47:58.310 --> 00:47:59.309
Félix.

757
00:48:02.560 --> 00:48:03.725
Félix.

758
00:48:07.935 --> 00:48:09.184
Félix.

759
00:48:16.101 --> 00:48:17.309
Félix.

760
00:48:20.810 --> 00:48:21.934
Félix!

761
00:48:26.685 --> 00:48:27.934
Félix!

762
00:48:30.393 --> 00:48:31.642
Félix!

763
00:48:34.226 --> 00:48:35.517
Félix!

764
00:48:37.060 --> 00:48:38.309
Félix!

765
00:48:41.726 --> 00:48:43.309
Cool, I like it.

766
00:48:43.476 --> 00:48:44.642
Yeah, yeah.

767
00:49:20.435 --> 00:49:24.059
I'm starting to worry
because this isn't it.


768
00:49:24.226 --> 00:49:25.309
This isn't it.

769
00:49:25.726 --> 00:49:29.434
Where are the sofa fabrics
I approved the other day?


770
00:49:29.976 --> 00:49:31.142
Here.

771
00:49:32.518 --> 00:49:34.309
Look, this is it.

772
00:49:34.476 --> 00:49:36.100
This one, this one.

773
00:49:36.268 --> 00:49:37.267
Not this one.

774
00:49:37.435 --> 00:49:39.017
See the difference?

775
00:49:39.518 --> 00:49:41.350
-Yes, I think so.
-You see?


776
00:49:42.268 --> 00:49:46.517
The curtains are from the house
of a simple, small-town guy.


777
00:49:46.810 --> 00:49:48.809
Yes, he has money,
but we have to imagine


778
00:49:48.976 --> 00:49:52.892
what he thinks is refined,
a rough, unrefined guy.


779
00:49:53.060 --> 00:49:56.725
What does he think is refined?
Not the art director. Got it?


780
00:49:56.893 --> 00:50:00.261
I've got it.
It's about this man's aspiration.


781
00:50:00.435 --> 00:50:01.600
-Exactly.
-Lola.


782
00:50:01.893 --> 00:50:05.642
Iván should've come half an hour ago.
I've called him three tiroes.


783
00:50:05.810 --> 00:50:07.642
-Call from my phone.
-Yes.


784
00:50:07.851 --> 00:50:08.934
Well, Susana, that's it.

785
00:50:09.185 --> 00:50:13.184
Check the notes, that's why I spent
seven hours looking at fabrics.


786
00:50:18.643 --> 00:50:20.475
<i>-Hello?</i>
-Iván, hello.


787
00:50:20.976 --> 00:50:22.975
<i>-Lola?</i>
-No, it's Julia.


788
00:50:23.143 --> 00:50:25.975
I'm calling from Lola's mobile,
my battery's run out.


789
00:50:26.143 --> 00:50:26.892
<i>Sure.</i>

790
00:50:27.060 --> 00:50:29.517
Iván, you do remember
that we start at 2 o'clock?


791
00:50:29.726 --> 00:50:31.559
Yes, it's in my diary,

792
00:50:31.726 --> 00:50:34.434
but since I was made to wait
in the last rehearsal


793
00:50:34.601 --> 00:50:36.975
and the one before,

794
00:50:37.351 --> 00:50:39.559
etcetera, etcetera,

795
00:50:39.726 --> 00:50:42.267
today I'll make them wait
two hours to make up for it.


796
00:50:42.476 --> 00:50:44.017
And I'm charging for it.

797
00:50:44.310 --> 00:50:46.600
I'll see you at 4 pm.

798
00:50:46.768 --> 00:50:48.392
I'll be on time.

799
00:51:05.935 --> 00:51:07.600
Sorry.

800
00:51:07.768 --> 00:51:08.975
It's...

801
00:51:09.768 --> 00:51:13.434
a series about an astronaut.

802
00:51:13.601 --> 00:51:16.141
On the way back in a spaceship,

803
00:51:16.351 --> 00:51:19.267
he lands on an island
inhabited by savages


804
00:51:19.435 --> 00:51:22.309
who've never had any contact
with civilization.


805
00:51:22.476 --> 00:51:24.142
I play the astronaut.

806
00:51:24.310 --> 00:51:25.100
How awful.

807
00:51:25.310 --> 00:51:28.975
It's so bad, it could be great, eh?

808
00:51:29.143 --> 00:51:32.684
-Mark my words.
-Yes, great.


809
00:51:41.893 --> 00:51:43.184
This is nice.

810
00:51:43.393 --> 00:51:47.142
What a waste.
Nobody's ever used it.


811
00:51:47.601 --> 00:51:51.309
For a pharmaceutical congress,
at the very most.


812
00:51:55.435 --> 00:51:58.225
These are just some of them.

813
00:51:58.768 --> 00:52:02.392
From right to left,
the San Sebastián Silver Shell,


814
00:52:02.560 --> 00:52:04.309
two Golden Globes,

815
00:52:04.476 --> 00:52:07.309
the Volpi Cup from the Venice festival,

816
00:52:07.476 --> 00:52:09.684
and two of my five Goyas.

817
00:52:09.851 --> 00:52:11.975
The other three
are in my home in Saint-Tropez.


818
00:52:12.226 --> 00:52:15.100
The rest are in
the Los Angeles house.


819
00:52:15.310 --> 00:52:17.767
-A lot.
-Why did you make us bring them?


820
00:52:18.476 --> 00:52:21.059
We're going to do
a little thing with them.


821
00:52:21.268 --> 00:52:22.767
Yours, Iván?

822
00:52:24.768 --> 00:52:26.684
I don't have nearly as many.

823
00:52:26.867 --> 00:52:29.892
Obviously, I must be
a much worse actor.


824
00:52:31.018 --> 00:52:34.684
The Medal for Excellence
in the Performing Arts,


825
00:52:35.685 --> 00:52:37.517
a Max Award...

826
00:52:39.435 --> 00:52:42.184
And this is the most important of all.

827
00:52:43.893 --> 00:52:47.684
I was given it at a school
for disabled children.


828
00:52:47.851 --> 00:52:49.892
I went to teach the kids there.

829
00:52:50.060 --> 00:52:51.475
They made it themselves.

830
00:52:51.726 --> 00:52:54.767
A beautiful experience.

831
00:52:54.935 --> 00:52:56.767
-Shall we start?
-Yes, let's start.


832
00:53:17.018 --> 00:53:19.475
Trust, trust, guys.

833
00:53:21.935 --> 00:53:24.850
I want you to lose
all autonomy, all of it.


834
00:53:25.851 --> 00:53:28.600
One is anchored to the other,
and vice versa.


835
00:53:28.935 --> 00:53:30.225
There are two of them.

836
00:53:31.726 --> 00:53:35.184
Two, but subordinate
to a single path.


837
00:53:35.393 --> 00:53:37.725
They are two, but with one "I".

838
00:53:37.893 --> 00:53:41.225
With a deformed "I",
it's deformed.


839
00:53:41.810 --> 00:53:46.017
It's one of the things I like most
about the novel, if not <i>the</i> most.


840
00:53:47.060 --> 00:53:50.350
The body as an enclosure,

841
00:53:51.185 --> 00:53:53.434
a prison and a sentence,

842
00:53:54.935 --> 00:53:58.892
where the skin is merely
a casing, a vessel.


843
00:54:00.018 --> 00:54:01.267
One.

844
00:54:02.601 --> 00:54:03.892
One only.

845
00:54:14.060 --> 00:54:14.725
Curtain!

846
00:54:54.351 --> 00:54:55.434
No! No!

847
00:54:57.810 --> 00:54:59.517
Fucking bitch!

848
00:55:01.310 --> 00:55:03.309
No, Lola!

849
00:55:06.393 --> 00:55:08.225
Not that, no!

850
00:55:21.101 --> 00:55:22.184
No!

851
00:55:24.185 --> 00:55:25.267
No!

852
00:55:29.101 --> 00:55:32.142
No, not that, please!

853
00:55:38.185 --> 00:55:39.600
Fucking bitch!

854
00:55:43.643 --> 00:55:44.684
Not that!

855
00:55:47.226 --> 00:55:48.392
Not that!

856
00:55:53.060 --> 00:55:54.309
Not that!

857
00:55:54.726 --> 00:55:55.809
No!

858
00:55:56.268 --> 00:55:57.267
No, no!

859
00:55:58.351 --> 00:55:59.350
No!

860
00:56:03.393 --> 00:56:05.100
Lola, no!

861
00:56:07.185 --> 00:56:09.892
My Silver Lion for Best Director

862
00:56:10.060 --> 00:56:13.184
and my Palme d'Or
for Best Picture.


863
00:56:17.310 --> 00:56:18.642
Fuck it.

864
00:56:23.643 --> 00:56:26.934
Well, it seems the awards
we're good for something.


865
00:56:28.518 --> 00:56:29.684
Gentlemen,

866
00:56:30.685 --> 00:56:33.184
an exercise on the ego.

867
00:56:34.018 --> 00:56:35.600
What is she doing, the bitch?!

868
00:56:35.768 --> 00:56:39.642
Guys, 15 minutes break
and we go to 63.


869
00:56:40.893 --> 00:56:41.725
Take it easy, Félix!

870
00:56:42.018 --> 00:56:45.392
Give me one reason,
one, to justify what you did!


871
00:56:45.560 --> 00:56:48.309
Why the fucking hell
did you do that?


872
00:56:48.476 --> 00:56:50.850
-To transform.
-Do you know what it means to us?


873
00:56:51.018 --> 00:56:53.350
To transform, that's the reason.
It transforms.


874
00:56:53.518 --> 00:56:56.225
Transform... I'll turn your face
into a Picasso!


875
00:56:56.435 --> 00:56:57.309
Take it easy, Félix.

876
00:56:57.518 --> 00:57:00.600
-That was nuts. We'll talk about this.
-Whenever you like, Iván.


877
00:57:00.768 --> 00:57:02.017
She's crazy.

878
00:57:04.143 --> 00:57:05.934
I'm sending a stack of lawyers!

879
00:57:06.101 --> 00:57:07.934
I'm so scared.
Give them my address.


880
00:57:08.101 --> 00:57:11.600
-4310 Segurola and La Habana, 7th floor.
-They'll be there!


881
01:00:00.143 --> 01:00:03.642
Félix's lawyers demand that
the destroyed awards are replaced


882
01:00:03.810 --> 01:00:06.809
and their client reimbursed
for non-material damages.


883
01:00:06.976 --> 01:00:09.017
Fuck, "non-material damages"...

884
01:00:09.310 --> 01:00:09.975
Let's see?

885
01:00:10.226 --> 01:00:14.309
Duplicates of the six you destroyed
comes to 83,000 euros.


886
01:00:14.476 --> 01:00:18.017
I don't care, they can work it out
with the producer, not me.


887
01:00:18.643 --> 01:00:21.392
The catering people are here.
You asked to try the food...


888
01:00:21.643 --> 01:00:24.559
-No, don't depress me with that today.
-Fine.


889
01:00:24.768 --> 01:00:28.975
The day I got out,
I wanted to go back to jail.


890
01:00:29.393 --> 01:00:30.850
No, no.

891
01:00:31.101 --> 01:00:32.684
-What?
-No.


892
01:00:32.893 --> 01:00:33.850
Don't look at him.

893
01:00:34.018 --> 01:00:34.892
Don't look at him,

894
01:00:35.060 --> 01:00:37.017
and when you do, at the end,

895
01:00:37.185 --> 01:00:40.434
I want you to bore into him
with your look, to see his soul.


896
01:00:40.601 --> 01:00:41.642
Again.

897
01:00:44.601 --> 01:00:45.684
Action.

898
01:00:47.476 --> 01:00:49.142
The day I...

899
01:00:49.310 --> 01:00:50.267
No.

900
01:00:50.435 --> 01:00:52.600
No, no, no.

901
01:00:52.768 --> 01:00:53.434
But...

902
01:00:53.601 --> 01:00:57.934
Look, Lola, I've made
over a hundred films,


903
01:00:58.185 --> 01:01:02.142
and you're going to tell me
how to do my fucking job?


904
01:01:02.351 --> 01:01:03.725
Don't fuck with me.

905
01:01:03.893 --> 01:01:05.142
Let me do the scene once,

906
01:01:05.310 --> 01:01:09.600
and if you don't like it,
you come and do it, eh, cutie?


907
01:01:10.643 --> 01:01:11.850
Sorry.

908
01:01:12.935 --> 01:01:14.892
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

909
01:01:17.143 --> 01:01:18.350
Excuse me.

910
01:01:19.143 --> 01:01:21.892
Excuse me, Lola.
You too, Iván, I'm sorry.


911
01:01:22.143 --> 01:01:22.725
Sorry.

912
01:01:22.893 --> 01:01:25.434
Félix, I'm sorry,
but I have to believe it.


913
01:01:25.601 --> 01:01:27.975
No, no, it's just...

914
01:01:30.018 --> 01:01:32.184
I'm upset about a personal matter.

915
01:01:32.351 --> 01:01:34.100
It's my problem

916
01:01:34.268 --> 01:01:37.017
and I took it out on you.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.


917
01:01:37.185 --> 01:01:39.975
Did you fight with your new call girl?

918
01:01:40.143 --> 01:01:42.725
Okay, it's fine,
we all have bad days.


919
01:01:42.976 --> 01:01:43.975
Yes.

920
01:01:44.268 --> 01:01:47.725
-From the top.
-Lola, Lola, wait. Iván...


921
01:01:50.518 --> 01:01:52.517
I have something to tell you.

922
01:01:53.935 --> 01:01:56.850
It's very hard to say,

923
01:01:57.018 --> 01:01:59.725
but I think you both should know.

924
01:02:00.685 --> 01:02:02.350
It turns out...

925
01:02:02.810 --> 01:02:04.934
I don't want to shake you up.

926
01:02:05.310 --> 01:02:09.725
If there's anything I don't want,
it's to be pitied.


927
01:02:11.310 --> 01:02:13.142
First of all, I'm fine,

928
01:02:13.768 --> 01:02:17.184
as well as one can be
under the circumstances.


929
01:02:17.893 --> 01:02:19.809
Anyway...

930
01:02:19.976 --> 01:02:22.809
I'd better get to the point,
come straight out with it.


931
01:02:23.310 --> 01:02:25.559
Earlier this month

932
01:02:25.726 --> 01:02:29.059
I had a medical check-up and...

933
01:02:29.518 --> 01:02:31.434
the results weren't good.

934
01:02:32.643 --> 01:02:35.142
Not good at all.

935
01:02:36.726 --> 01:02:39.392
Adenocarcinoma of the pancreas.

936
01:02:40.976 --> 01:02:42.309
Cancer.

937
01:02:43.435 --> 01:02:44.600
And...

938
01:02:45.601 --> 01:02:49.934
the prognosis isn't encouraging.

939
01:02:50.810 --> 01:02:53.142
I have to have more tests,

940
01:02:53.310 --> 01:02:56.309
but if they confirm
what seems to be...


941
01:02:57.018 --> 01:02:58.475
a fact,

942
01:02:59.185 --> 01:03:01.475
I have at most a year left.

943
01:03:07.476 --> 01:03:08.892
But...

944
01:03:10.893 --> 01:03:12.850
Is there no treatment?

945
01:03:14.310 --> 01:03:17.725
Yes, but it's very invasive and...

946
01:03:18.518 --> 01:03:20.434
I decided not to do anything.

947
01:03:21.143 --> 01:03:22.934
I'm just on palliatives.

948
01:03:25.143 --> 01:03:27.892
I haven't cancelled any project.

949
01:03:28.268 --> 01:03:31.309
I'm carrying on with
my normal life while I can.


950
01:03:35.643 --> 01:03:36.892
I want...

951
01:03:38.643 --> 01:03:40.725
I want death to catch me
living my life.


952
01:03:44.643 --> 01:03:49.350
Lola, Iván, I want my last film
to be a great film.


953
01:03:51.310 --> 01:03:53.559
And I'm going to do my utmost,

954
01:03:53.726 --> 01:03:55.350
absolutely.

955
01:03:57.560 --> 01:04:01.975
Maybe I can even channel
this painful experience


956
01:04:02.935 --> 01:04:05.267
to nourish my character.

957
01:04:07.143 --> 01:04:09.767
Count on my help
for whatever you want.


958
01:04:11.101 --> 01:04:12.434
Thank you.

959
01:04:14.685 --> 01:04:17.434
We're going to make
a fucking great film.


960
01:04:22.185 --> 01:04:25.184
Forgive my mood swings
and these outbursts, but...


961
01:04:25.393 --> 01:04:28.017
this medication has got me...

962
01:04:28.268 --> 01:04:30.059
kind of crazy.

963
01:04:30.310 --> 01:04:32.809
Everything disturbs me and...

964
01:05:18.018 --> 01:05:19.225
Julia.

965
01:05:20.726 --> 01:05:21.809
Can you hear me?

966
01:05:25.601 --> 01:05:29.059
What I'm going to tell you
is between us, okay?


967
01:05:31.060 --> 01:05:34.017
Félix is sick. 
He has cancer.

968
01:05:35.518 --> 01:05:38.350
Yes, awful. He told us today.

969
01:05:38.518 --> 01:05:40.309
He hasn't long to live.

970
01:05:42.101 --> 01:05:44.559
So we have to shoot sooner.

971
01:05:44.726 --> 01:05:46.309
Yes, two weeks.

972
01:05:47.560 --> 01:05:49.309
Yes, yes, sure we can.

973
01:05:49.476 --> 01:05:51.934
We have to start on the 21st.

974
01:05:52.601 --> 01:05:55.017
I don't know, nor do I care.

975
01:05:55.226 --> 01:05:58.184
PANCREATIC CANCER:
WHY IS IT THE DEADLIEST?


976
01:06:11.726 --> 01:06:14.434
DENTAL BLEACHING

977
01:06:54.435 --> 01:06:58.725
Losing one of your actors
as soon as you start shooting.


978
01:07:02.143 --> 01:07:03.850
What a disaster.

979
01:07:04.476 --> 01:07:07.517
How was I to know
he was going through all this?


980
01:07:07.685 --> 01:07:10.850
He looks fine,
always full of energy.


981
01:07:11.101 --> 01:07:12.934
It's horrible, yes.

982
01:07:13.310 --> 01:07:14.684
It's really tough.

983
01:07:15.935 --> 01:07:19.684
And it's a nasty cancer.

984
01:07:20.476 --> 01:07:23.184
And I'm demanding so much
from you, so much...


985
01:07:24.351 --> 01:07:26.892
Have I treated you so badly?

986
01:07:28.726 --> 01:07:30.934
You didn't know.

987
01:07:34.476 --> 01:07:37.392
It doesn't matter,
I'm a goddamn monster.


988
01:07:37.893 --> 01:07:40.809
It's because I suffer,
I suffer a lot with my films.


989
01:07:40.976 --> 01:07:44.559
I tried to do it differently,
but I can't. I don't know.


990
01:07:46.226 --> 01:07:47.600
Lola, sorry.

991
01:07:47.768 --> 01:07:50.434
Félix's mobile is off.
He's half an hour late.


992
01:07:50.685 --> 01:07:52.767
Don't call him again, my God.

993
01:07:57.435 --> 01:08:00.017
Poor guy must be with the doctors.

994
01:08:02.435 --> 01:08:05.267
What the fuck do we do now?

995
01:08:10.476 --> 01:08:13.100
Lola, I want to
tell you something because...


996
01:08:14.351 --> 01:08:17.309
I keep thinking about it too.

997
01:08:19.101 --> 01:08:20.767
If it gets worse...

998
01:08:20.935 --> 01:08:24.809
We hope not, of course,
we hope not.


999
01:08:26.560 --> 01:08:29.642
But if Félix can't go on,

1000
01:08:31.726 --> 01:08:34.975
I could play both roles.

1001
01:08:37.935 --> 01:08:40.600
Two brothers,
one with a beard,


1002
01:08:40.768 --> 01:08:42.934
the other without a beard...

1003
01:08:43.601 --> 01:08:45.475
Or they could be twins.

1004
01:08:46.476 --> 01:08:48.017
Why not?

1005
01:08:48.518 --> 01:08:49.850
Whatever.

1006
01:08:54.268 --> 01:08:56.350
It's an idea, that's all.

1007
01:09:08.310 --> 01:09:10.184
Oh, this stress.

1008
01:09:13.435 --> 01:09:15.434
My whole body hurts.

1009
01:09:15.810 --> 01:09:18.892
Squeeze a bit there,
please, my neck.


1010
01:09:25.185 --> 01:09:27.850
-Harder.
-Yes, hold on.


1011
01:09:28.851 --> 01:09:30.309
Harder.

1012
01:09:31.310 --> 01:09:34.309
Life is so hard sometimes.

1013
01:10:00.976 --> 01:10:03.309
Félix, how are you, honey?

1014
01:10:03.810 --> 01:10:05.475
It's all fine, fine.

1015
01:10:06.476 --> 01:10:07.850
Did you rest up?

1016
01:10:08.018 --> 01:10:11.142
Yes, I had a tiny domestic problem.

1017
01:10:11.351 --> 01:10:14.475
I was arguing with my ex-wife
all morning


1018
01:10:14.643 --> 01:10:18.309
because the bitch wants to stay
in my house in Saint-Tropez.


1019
01:10:18.560 --> 01:10:19.642
Do you know Saint
-Tropez?

1020
01:10:20.268 --> 01:10:21.975
Beautiful beaches.

1021
01:10:22.143 --> 01:10:23.892
Great nightlife too.

1022
01:10:25.685 --> 01:10:29.100
But she knows about
your disease, right?


1023
01:10:30.351 --> 01:10:31.517
What disease?

1024
01:10:31.893 --> 01:10:34.142
Oh, no, no... the cancer thing?

1025
01:10:34.310 --> 01:10:36.309
No, she doesn't because...

1026
01:10:36.601 --> 01:10:38.184
it's a lie.

1027
01:10:38.643 --> 01:10:39.642
It's a lie.

1028
01:10:39.810 --> 01:10:43.892
How can I be sick?
Just look at me.


1029
01:10:44.101 --> 01:10:45.725
I did it as...

1030
01:10:46.226 --> 01:10:48.309
a performance for you two,

1031
01:10:48.476 --> 01:10:52.184
a little acting demonstration.

1032
01:11:16.976 --> 01:11:18.475
So intense.

1033
01:11:19.685 --> 01:11:20.892
You do realize, right?

1034
01:11:21.143 --> 01:11:23.392
You don't play with that.
You son of a bitch.


1035
01:11:23.560 --> 01:11:25.809
A son of a bitch...

1036
01:11:26.351 --> 01:11:28.434
but a great actor too, clearly,

1037
01:11:28.601 --> 01:11:31.600
because you bought it,
hook, line and sinker.


1038
01:11:38.976 --> 01:11:41.017
You destroyed something
very fragile, Félix.


1039
01:11:41.185 --> 01:11:43.059
You destroyed it.

1040
01:11:43.351 --> 01:11:45.184
And you destroyed those awards.

1041
01:11:45.351 --> 01:11:47.100
-Don't speak.
-Huh?


1042
01:11:47.393 --> 01:11:48.725
Don't say anything.

1043
01:11:51.060 --> 01:11:53.559
Lola, what happened?

1044
01:11:53.810 --> 01:11:56.517
I can have a ton of things
going around my mind,


1045
01:11:56.655 --> 01:12:00.059
and it works perfectly,
despite the chaos.


1046
01:12:00.226 --> 01:12:04.184
Now this absurd, childish thing
between you two comes up,


1047
01:12:04.351 --> 01:12:06.642
and it's like a rock to the head,

1048
01:12:06.935 --> 01:12:09.600
I go into a kind of blackout.

1049
01:12:10.143 --> 01:12:11.892
Fuck, you're getting to know me

1050
01:12:12.101 --> 01:12:14.975
and you know that
I'm very, very sensitive.


1051
01:12:15.226 --> 01:12:16.559
Is it a gift? Yes.

1052
01:12:16.726 --> 01:12:19.975
Do I have a hard time?
Yes, I do!


1053
01:12:21.268 --> 01:12:25.600
Is this about whose dick is bigger,
who is more macho?


1054
01:12:25.976 --> 01:12:28.184
No, Lola, it's not.

1055
01:12:28.351 --> 01:12:31.684
In my case, I can assure you
that it's not like that.


1056
01:12:32.310 --> 01:12:34.100
Look, however...

1057
01:12:35.060 --> 01:12:38.350
out of place, stupid,
even unpleasant


1058
01:12:38.518 --> 01:12:41.309
what Félix did may be,

1059
01:12:42.726 --> 01:12:44.809
I mean... well...

1060
01:12:44.976 --> 01:12:47.100
There's competition,

1061
01:12:47.268 --> 01:12:48.725
there always is.

1062
01:12:48.893 --> 01:12:51.350
But in this case the situation,

1063
01:12:51.768 --> 01:12:54.267
and I want to make this clear,

1064
01:12:54.768 --> 01:12:56.309
it's objective,

1065
01:12:57.768 --> 01:12:59.392
it's reality,

1066
01:12:59.601 --> 01:13:02.184
it can't be concealed.

1067
01:13:02.518 --> 01:13:07.392
It's easy to see which one
of us has the most talent.


1068
01:13:08.768 --> 01:13:09.850
Come here.

1069
01:13:10.893 --> 01:13:14.892
Come over here.
It's good for you to hear too.


1070
01:13:15.351 --> 01:13:19.267
I'm saying that one
can tell very clearly


1071
01:13:19.435 --> 01:13:21.434
who is the better actor

1072
01:13:22.018 --> 01:13:24.142
between Félix and me.

1073
01:13:24.310 --> 01:13:25.892
And it's Félix.

1074
01:13:26.143 --> 01:13:30.059
Félix is a better actor than I am.

1075
01:13:30.851 --> 01:13:32.892
You know how to reach...

1076
01:13:34.101 --> 01:13:37.309
the audience, the people,
the real people.


1077
01:13:37.601 --> 01:13:39.642
On the other hand, I chose...

1078
01:13:40.893 --> 01:13:42.809
to believe I was prestigious.

1079
01:13:42.976 --> 01:13:46.892
I fooled myself, I told myself that
the audience wasn't at the level


1080
01:13:48.310 --> 01:13:50.309
of what I was doing.

1081
01:13:52.101 --> 01:13:53.225
Horrible.

1082
01:13:53.685 --> 01:13:56.517
A whole career based

1083
01:13:56.893 --> 01:13:58.975
on a false doctrine,

1084
01:13:59.685 --> 01:14:02.934
comfortable and fake,
which is even worse.


1085
01:14:04.685 --> 01:14:07.517
And I ended up realising,
working here with you,


1086
01:14:07.768 --> 01:14:10.434
and it's what I owe you,

1087
01:14:11.601 --> 01:14:15.934
that true artistic daring
lives in moving


1088
01:14:17.310 --> 01:14:19.767
the common people,
the common audience.


1089
01:14:20.310 --> 01:14:23.934
And that's tremendously hard,
extremely hard.


1090
01:14:24.101 --> 01:14:26.309
Félix does it,

1091
01:14:27.935 --> 01:14:29.850
hats off, like no one else.

1092
01:14:30.185 --> 01:14:31.267
Like the best.

1093
01:14:31.476 --> 01:14:33.392
You're the master.

1094
01:14:35.560 --> 01:14:36.975
I have to tell you that.

1095
01:14:38.560 --> 01:14:40.267
Iván, I don't...

1096
01:14:40.726 --> 01:14:44.017
I'm very grateful
for your words, really.


1097
01:14:44.851 --> 01:14:48.309
For someone with your career
to speak like that...


1098
01:14:49.476 --> 01:14:52.059
You're the master of acting,

1099
01:14:52.226 --> 01:14:54.684
and for me what you said

1100
01:14:54.851 --> 01:14:57.309
is better than any award.

1101
01:14:58.310 --> 01:15:01.517
Lola, I'll always be
grateful to you


1102
01:15:01.685 --> 01:15:04.392
that you had the idea
to put us together.


1103
01:15:06.560 --> 01:15:10.725
I must say that I also had
a lot of prejudices against you.


1104
01:15:11.101 --> 01:15:14.642
The great master,
the one who knows the most...


1105
01:15:15.018 --> 01:15:18.309
But I've seen that
you're all that and more.


1106
01:15:19.143 --> 01:15:21.809
An actor in capital letters.

1107
01:15:22.935 --> 01:15:25.434
And I'm sure that this film

1108
01:15:25.601 --> 01:15:28.559
will see you recognised
by the general public.


1109
01:15:29.393 --> 01:15:30.475
Yes, sir.

1110
01:15:31.810 --> 01:15:35.225
I was returning the courtesy, Félix.

1111
01:15:36.726 --> 01:15:38.059
I was acting.

1112
01:15:38.226 --> 01:15:40.517
You believed it, eh? I got you.

1113
01:15:41.226 --> 01:15:42.350
The general public

1114
01:15:43.310 --> 01:15:47.017
is a mass of ignorant,
passive people with no ideas,


1115
01:15:47.185 --> 01:15:48.475
and actors like you

1116
01:15:49.226 --> 01:15:53.392
leave the audience
even more stultified.


1117
01:15:54.601 --> 01:15:56.475
And you always give them
the same thing.


1118
01:15:56.643 --> 01:15:59.309
Pure banal entertainment,

1119
01:15:59.476 --> 01:16:03.059
which doesn't even entertain me,
incidentally.


1120
01:16:03.226 --> 01:16:06.142
That's what I really think.

1121
01:16:06.310 --> 01:16:08.225
Sorry, Lola, sorry.

1122
01:16:08.685 --> 01:16:09.850
Forgive me.

1123
01:16:10.393 --> 01:16:13.059
One-all. We're tied.

1124
01:16:18.393 --> 01:16:19.642
That's true.

1125
01:16:19.810 --> 01:16:22.184
No one likes how I act.

1126
01:16:22.351 --> 01:16:23.684
Except the audience.

1127
01:16:23.851 --> 01:16:25.225
No less.

1128
01:16:25.393 --> 01:16:28.184
-Julia, when's the next rehearsal?
-Thursday.


1129
01:16:28.393 --> 01:16:29.600
Thursday.

1130
01:16:31.143 --> 01:16:33.142
Good, because I can't
handle you two anymore.


1131
01:16:33.310 --> 01:16:34.600
No rehearsal today.

1132
01:16:34.768 --> 01:16:36.350
Until Thursday.

1133
01:16:42.018 --> 01:16:43.517
Amazing.

1134
01:16:43.976 --> 01:16:45.892
I totally believed it.

1135
01:16:46.851 --> 01:16:48.767
You as an audience believed it,

1136
01:16:48.935 --> 01:16:52.517
but I believed it first,
do you understand?


1137
01:16:52.685 --> 01:16:53.392
Sure.

1138
01:16:53.560 --> 01:16:56.017
I have to believe it
so that you do.


1139
01:16:56.185 --> 01:16:58.559
I never tire of telling my students:

1140
01:16:58.726 --> 01:17:03.267
It's not about repeating the text,
but thinking like the character.


1141
01:17:03.435 --> 01:17:05.267
If you think like the character,

1142
01:17:05.435 --> 01:17:09.017
if you've captured
the mind of the character,


1143
01:17:09.185 --> 01:17:11.225
the rest comes by itself.

1144
01:17:11.393 --> 01:17:12.725
It's as simple

1145
01:17:12.893 --> 01:17:15.267
and as complex as that.

1146
01:17:15.435 --> 01:17:16.475
Excuse me.

1147
01:17:19.643 --> 01:17:21.059
YOU'RE FIRED YOU IDIOT

1148
01:17:21.226 --> 01:17:22.725
Is something wrong?

1149
01:18:30.518 --> 01:18:31.684
Excuse me.

1150
01:18:32.310 --> 01:18:33.850
Félix, Iván,

1151
01:18:34.101 --> 01:18:36.225
Lola just told me she's not coming.

1152
01:18:36.435 --> 01:18:38.642
I'll read the message.

1153
01:18:38.976 --> 01:18:43.309
"Tell them this is today's rehearsal,
the experience of coming in vain.


1154
01:18:43.643 --> 01:18:46.475
This question mark,
the void of the unforeseen,


1155
01:18:46.643 --> 01:18:49.309
will make them think
about themselves.


1156
01:18:49.476 --> 01:18:51.225
I'll see them on Tuesday."

1157
01:18:52.851 --> 01:18:53.934
Sorry.

1158
01:18:57.851 --> 01:18:59.059
Holy shit, man.

1159
01:18:59.226 --> 01:19:01.309
Holy shit.

1160
01:19:01.560 --> 01:19:05.225
Let's not give this nutcase
the satisfaction of a comment.


1161
01:19:05.810 --> 01:19:07.309
What a bitch.

1162
01:19:08.018 --> 01:19:10.100
Goddamn bitch.

1163
01:19:11.476 --> 01:19:12.350
Fucking bitch!

1164
01:19:35.310 --> 01:19:38.517
-Wonderful.
-Yes, it's great, great.


1165
01:19:38.685 --> 01:19:43.475
Listen to that texture,
the dirt in the background.


1166
01:19:43.643 --> 01:19:44.684
Can you hear it?

1167
01:19:44.851 --> 01:19:46.725
Like a latent...

1168
01:19:46.893 --> 01:19:49.559
Yes. Very dense.

1169
01:19:49.851 --> 01:19:51.184
And now..

1170
01:19:52.601 --> 01:19:54.767
Now it goes to the limit.

1171
01:20:00.601 --> 01:20:02.309
Where is he from?

1172
01:20:02.685 --> 01:20:05.392
He's Canadian,
but he lives in Düsseldorf.


1173
01:20:05.560 --> 01:20:07.475
He's a performer as well.

1174
01:20:10.768 --> 01:20:15.142
These sounds fascinate me,
that timeless, tribal banging.


1175
01:20:15.310 --> 01:20:16.642
Listen.

1176
01:20:20.018 --> 01:20:22.017
No, no, I think...

1177
01:20:23.310 --> 01:20:24.892
I think it's...

1178
01:20:26.560 --> 01:20:29.600
the man next door
nailing something.


1179
01:20:31.851 --> 01:20:33.850
Yes, it's him, fuck it.

1180
01:20:40.185 --> 01:20:41.809
Misunderstood.

1181
01:20:43.351 --> 01:20:44.850
Lesbian.

1182
01:20:46.268 --> 01:20:47.934
Pretentious.

1183
01:20:48.226 --> 01:20:49.600
Depraved.

1184
01:20:50.935 --> 01:20:52.142
Cruel.

1185
01:20:54.018 --> 01:20:56.225
Whore. Whore.

1186
01:20:57.560 --> 01:20:58.892
Girl.

1187
01:20:59.643 --> 01:21:00.892
Girl.

1188
01:21:03.601 --> 01:21:04.850
Alone.

1189
01:21:06.310 --> 01:21:07.809
Alone.

1190
01:21:10.893 --> 01:21:13.392
Terrified. Terrified.

1191
01:21:15.226 --> 01:21:16.309
Genius.

1192
01:21:18.185 --> 01:21:20.142
Jerk.

1193
01:21:21.185 --> 01:21:22.350
Crazy.

1194
01:21:24.268 --> 01:21:25.392
Crazy.

1195
01:21:26.643 --> 01:21:27.934
You're crazy.

1196
01:21:28.893 --> 01:21:31.809
Ridiculous.

1197
01:21:35.185 --> 01:21:36.225
Ridiculous.

1198
01:21:36.393 --> 01:21:39.350
Sorry, I didn't want to interrupt,
but they're ready.


1199
01:21:40.143 --> 01:21:42.184
What, what? What now?

1200
01:21:42.351 --> 01:21:43.642
They're set.

1201
01:21:46.435 --> 01:21:49.434
Not one fucking moment
to myself, really!


1202
01:21:49.601 --> 01:21:52.017
Not a single one.

1203
01:21:52.310 --> 01:21:53.642
Idiot!

1204
01:21:53.893 --> 01:21:54.850
Ignoramus!

1205
01:21:55.018 --> 01:21:56.600
Son of a bitch!

1206
01:21:56.768 --> 01:21:57.559
Prick!

1207
01:21:57.726 --> 01:21:59.017
Ass kisser!

1208
01:21:59.185 --> 01:22:00.350
Go fuck yourself!

1209
01:22:01.810 --> 01:22:03.184
Double fuck yourself!

1210
01:22:03.351 --> 01:22:04.392
Fathead, filth!

1211
01:22:04.560 --> 01:22:05.392
Bastard!

1212
01:22:05.560 --> 01:22:06.392
Scumbag!

1213
01:22:06.560 --> 01:22:07.517
Shit eater!

1214
01:22:07.685 --> 01:22:08.434
Leech!

1215
01:22:08.601 --> 01:22:10.309
I shit on your teeth!

1216
01:22:10.476 --> 01:22:12.934
Double fuck your mother!

1217
01:22:13.185 --> 01:22:15.475
Triple fuck your fucking mother!

1218
01:22:15.643 --> 01:22:16.684
Nutjob!

1219
01:22:16.851 --> 01:22:17.642
Abortion!

1220
01:22:17.810 --> 01:22:20.184
Son of a truckful of bitches!

1221
01:22:21.601 --> 01:22:26.434
I shit on the ass crack
and pussy of your fucking mother!


1222
01:22:26.685 --> 01:22:30.017
Fuck your mother!
I shit on your mother's face!


1223
01:22:30.185 --> 01:22:31.392
Not me.

1224
01:22:31.643 --> 01:22:33.184
Not me, Iván Torres.

1225
01:22:33.351 --> 01:22:37.142
I shit on the whole Torres family,

1226
01:22:37.310 --> 01:22:38.975
on the Torres of the past,

1227
01:22:39.226 --> 01:22:40.600
the present

1228
01:22:40.768 --> 01:22:42.517
and of the future!

1229
01:22:42.685 --> 01:22:43.850
On all the Torres!

1230
01:22:44.018 --> 01:22:45.350
Félix Rivero,

1231
01:22:45.518 --> 01:22:49.725
if there wasn't a lady present,
I'd beat the living shit out of you.


1232
01:22:49.893 --> 01:22:51.350
Right, that's enough.

1233
01:22:51.685 --> 01:22:55.434
It was just an exercise
to warm up for rehearsal.


1234
01:22:55.601 --> 01:22:57.559
-That's enough.
-Take it easy.


1235
01:22:57.726 --> 01:23:01.517
I'd never hit an old man
clearly in inferior shape.


1236
01:23:01.685 --> 01:23:03.475
So speaks the kid
who's a slave to money.


1237
01:23:03.643 --> 01:23:05.559
You're a slave too,
but for less money.


1238
01:23:05.726 --> 01:23:07.017
Enough, enough.

1239
01:23:07.185 --> 01:23:09.684
We rehearse in 15.
Let's go, guys.


1240
01:23:11.351 --> 01:23:13.184
Look, this is Pedro's house.

1241
01:23:13.351 --> 01:23:15.975
Here, he's having dinner with Lucy
when Manuel arrives.


1242
01:23:16.143 --> 01:23:16.975
Perfect.

1243
01:23:17.143 --> 01:23:20.309
And all this is the fields outside.

1244
01:23:21.310 --> 01:23:25.475
There, where the door is,
is the foundry.


1245
01:23:25.643 --> 01:23:26.725
Excellent.

1246
01:23:27.476 --> 01:23:31.725
And here, in this spot,
you two stop for the ending.


1247
01:23:31.893 --> 01:23:33.184
Got it. Good, good.

1248
01:23:33.393 --> 01:23:35.559
All this minimalism.

1249
01:23:36.435 --> 01:23:40.434
It takes me back to
my beginnings, in the 60s.


1250
01:23:40.893 --> 01:23:45.600
Laboratory Theatre,
this is older than...


1251
01:23:46.893 --> 01:23:49.517
I don't know if it's useful
to rehearse like this, but...


1252
01:23:49.685 --> 01:23:51.017
It's useful to me.

1253
01:23:51.185 --> 01:23:53.309
Exactly, it's useful.

1254
01:23:53.935 --> 01:23:56.100
Guys, this is the most complex,

1255
01:23:56.310 --> 01:23:59.059
the biggest scene in the film,
so, concentration.


1256
01:23:59.226 --> 01:24:00.559
Come on, let's do it.

1257
01:24:00.726 --> 01:24:03.225
-Diana, are you ready?
-Lucy is ready.


1258
01:24:03.976 --> 01:24:06.684
One thing, Iván.

1259
01:24:08.268 --> 01:24:11.642
Did you do something to your teeth?
They're very white.


1260
01:24:12.518 --> 01:24:13.434
No.

1261
01:24:13.601 --> 01:24:15.580
Okay, nobody interrupts
the rehearsal but me.


1262
01:24:15.810 --> 01:24:17.475
No one cuts for any reason.

1263
01:24:17.643 --> 01:24:20.059
I want a full take, okay?

1264
01:24:20.393 --> 01:24:23.434
People, this is the final scene.

1265
01:24:23.601 --> 01:24:25.559
Julia, lights, please.

1266
01:24:26.685 --> 01:24:28.017
Focus.

1267
01:24:29.726 --> 01:24:30.809
Action.

1268
01:24:46.601 --> 01:24:48.350
You hesitate for a second.

1269
01:25:09.060 --> 01:25:10.059
Hello.

1270
01:25:11.393 --> 01:25:12.809
I need to talk to you.

1271
01:25:12.976 --> 01:25:16.309
Impossible. I'm about to
have dinner with my wife.


1272
01:25:16.518 --> 01:25:17.809
Please.

1273
01:25:18.185 --> 01:25:19.434
I can't take any more.

1274
01:25:19.685 --> 01:25:23.350
I need to talk to you,
even if it's for the last time.


1275
01:25:23.518 --> 01:25:24.892
-Mum and Dad...
-Don't even say their names.


1276
01:25:25.060 --> 01:25:26.642
Please, please.

1277
01:25:26.935 --> 01:25:29.850
Iván, you hesitate, but give in.

1278
01:25:31.310 --> 01:25:32.517
Lucy.

1279
01:25:34.351 --> 01:25:38.600
I'll be back in a few minutes
and we'll have dinner.


1280
01:25:42.226 --> 01:25:45.892
-Let's get away from the house.
-Yes, that's better.


1281
01:25:48.935 --> 01:25:53.309
Even if it's too late,
I wanted to apologise to you.


1282
01:25:55.143 --> 01:25:56.600
Hold it there.

1283
01:25:57.143 --> 01:25:59.725
I always competed with you.

1284
01:25:59.893 --> 01:26:03.934
And you always protected me,
almost like a father.


1285
01:26:04.976 --> 01:26:07.309
Now you've started a family
with Lucy


1286
01:26:07.518 --> 01:26:12.392
and I'm sure she's made
the best choice.


1287
01:26:16.143 --> 01:26:18.309
There's nothing...

1288
01:26:19.018 --> 01:26:21.934
Not everything
can be expressed in words.


1289
01:26:23.351 --> 01:26:25.017
I just want to...

1290
01:26:26.476 --> 01:26:28.142
tell you I'm sorry...

1291
01:26:29.226 --> 01:26:30.725
for everything.

1292
01:26:31.268 --> 01:26:33.642
Manuel, you paid your debt.

1293
01:26:34.851 --> 01:26:36.392
That's all over.

1294
01:26:38.101 --> 01:26:40.642
And it was crystal clear that...

1295
01:26:41.726 --> 01:26:44.309
you had no bad intentions.

1296
01:26:45.143 --> 01:26:49.517
Don't think it was easy for me
to testify against you.


1297
01:26:51.351 --> 01:26:54.684
Maybe it was my way...

1298
01:26:54.851 --> 01:26:58.267
of putting the pain somewhere.

1299
01:27:02.976 --> 01:27:06.309
The truth is that,
whatever happens,


1300
01:27:09.060 --> 01:27:10.642
we're brothers.

1301
01:27:12.518 --> 01:27:13.767
They hug.

1302
01:27:16.476 --> 01:27:18.934
Turn, turn, turn.

1303
01:27:21.518 --> 01:27:22.475
Now!

1304
01:27:39.518 --> 01:27:41.100
Let's see who's in charge now.

1305
01:27:41.310 --> 01:27:43.767
Now drag him to the foundry.

1306
01:28:06.060 --> 01:28:07.975
And you put him in the oven.

1307
01:28:23.393 --> 01:28:25.267
He transforms.

1308
01:28:27.726 --> 01:28:29.267
Glasses.

1309
01:28:34.518 --> 01:28:35.809
Cap.

1310
01:28:44.851 --> 01:28:47.725
That's it.
The complete mutation.


1311
01:28:48.518 --> 01:28:52.850
Now you go home
as if nothing's happened.


1312
01:29:02.351 --> 01:29:04.434
Here the voice-over
would come in.


1313
01:29:08.435 --> 01:29:11.225
Manuel took over the life
of his brother.


1314
01:29:13.518 --> 01:29:16.892
No one could've mistaken
Manuel for Pedro,


1315
01:29:17.768 --> 01:29:20.559
but Lucy and the whole town

1316
01:29:20.726 --> 01:29:23.684
chose to pretend
that Manuel was Pedro.


1317
01:29:25.393 --> 01:29:26.600
And full stop.

1318
01:29:28.976 --> 01:29:30.350
The end.

1319
01:29:34.810 --> 01:29:36.017
Okay, cut.

1320
01:29:37.310 --> 01:29:38.725
Very good.

1321
01:29:39.018 --> 01:29:40.684
Very good, yes sir.

1322
01:29:41.310 --> 01:29:43.684
Rest up, we'll be playing this
loads of times.


1323
01:29:43.851 --> 01:29:45.267
I didn't think it was that good.

1324
01:29:45.435 --> 01:29:47.934
You have to know it in your sleep.

1325
01:29:48.101 --> 01:29:49.517
But it was great.

1326
01:29:50.685 --> 01:29:51.725
Very good.

1327
01:29:51.893 --> 01:29:54.142
All three looking at the camera, please.

1328
01:30:00.935 --> 01:30:02.600
Don't move.

1329
01:30:09.726 --> 01:30:11.475
Everyone look that way, please.

1330
01:30:11.643 --> 01:30:12.725
That's it.

1331
01:30:18.435 --> 01:30:20.767
Great. Smile, please.

1332
01:30:35.935 --> 01:30:38.100
One moment, please.

1333
01:30:40.643 --> 01:30:41.642
That's it.

1334
01:30:46.143 --> 01:30:48.975
Thank you, everyone,
for coming today.


1335
01:30:50.643 --> 01:30:53.392
It's a very important time
in my life.


1336
01:30:54.726 --> 01:30:59.475
We're celebrating the start
of this adventure I've put you on.


1337
01:31:01.060 --> 01:31:03.725
Shooting begins in two days.

1338
01:31:05.601 --> 01:31:08.642
I want to thank these great artists,

1339
01:31:08.810 --> 01:31:12.392
who at this stage of my life
I consider to be my friends,


1340
01:31:12.560 --> 01:31:14.184
for joining the project.

1341
01:31:15.018 --> 01:31:18.975
Félix and Iván,
our two greatest actors,


1342
01:31:19.143 --> 01:31:21.184
together for the first time!

1343
01:31:23.393 --> 01:31:24.642
Thank you very much.

1344
01:31:26.726 --> 01:31:28.059
Lola,

1345
01:31:28.685 --> 01:31:30.184
what can I tell you?

1346
01:31:31.060 --> 01:31:33.517
-Sometimes you bewilder me.
-Oh, really?


1347
01:31:33.685 --> 01:31:37.850
But I see the genius of your ideas.

1348
01:31:38.101 --> 01:31:40.767
You know that
I consider you my friend.


1349
01:31:40.935 --> 01:31:43.975
Perhaps you want to say a few words.

1350
01:31:44.143 --> 01:31:44.809
No, no.

1351
01:31:45.060 --> 01:31:46.767
-Yes, please, come, Lola.
-Thank you.


1352
01:31:46.935 --> 01:31:48.434
Yes, of course.

1353
01:31:50.268 --> 01:31:53.684
Thank you,
and make the best of films!


1354
01:31:59.060 --> 01:32:01.142
The best of films....

1355
01:32:01.976 --> 01:32:04.225
What is that, Humberto?

1356
01:32:05.393 --> 01:32:07.142
I often wonder

1357
01:32:07.310 --> 01:32:11.225
if there's a kind of canon
we should follow.


1358
01:32:11.810 --> 01:32:13.600
Right? I wonder if...

1359
01:32:14.560 --> 01:32:19.225
we can dislike a film,
but think it's good as well.


1360
01:32:19.851 --> 01:32:23.184
And when we think
a film is good, is it good?


1361
01:32:25.018 --> 01:32:27.225
I don't know,
maybe it only reaffirms


1362
01:32:27.393 --> 01:32:31.642
our pigeonholed,
entrenched tastes.


1363
01:32:31.976 --> 01:32:35.309
We should be very careful
about what we like.


1364
01:32:36.935 --> 01:32:38.767
Because one sees
what one understands,


1365
01:32:38.935 --> 01:32:41.934
and what one doesn't understand,
one doesn't like.


1366
01:32:44.601 --> 01:32:49.100
Many important things
are those we don't understand.


1367
01:32:49.976 --> 01:32:51.892
Thank you, everyone.

1368
01:33:00.768 --> 01:33:02.642
I was thinking

1369
01:33:02.810 --> 01:33:05.184
it'd be great if you asked Félix...

1370
01:33:05.351 --> 01:33:06.059
What?

1371
01:33:06.310 --> 01:33:09.434
If you asked Félix to record
a message for Emilia,


1372
01:33:09.564 --> 01:33:10.934
she's a huge fan of his.

1373
01:33:11.101 --> 01:33:14.392
Don't count on me for such drivel.

1374
01:33:16.351 --> 01:33:18.225
But she's your niece.

1375
01:33:18.601 --> 01:33:19.850
And she's turning 15.

1376
01:33:20.018 --> 01:33:23.059
Those things are cringeworthy.

1377
01:33:24.685 --> 01:33:26.350
She'd die to get...

1378
01:33:26.518 --> 01:33:27.559
Even worse.

1379
01:33:27.726 --> 01:33:29.309
I'm sorry.

1380
01:33:29.476 --> 01:33:34.475
I don't agree with the vile upbringing
the parents gave that poor creature.


1381
01:33:35.643 --> 01:33:39.142
He gave out such a whomping...

1382
01:33:40.310 --> 01:33:43.392
If we'd done it for real,
it wouldn't have been


1383
01:33:43.560 --> 01:33:45.559
as dangerous as it was.

1384
01:33:45.810 --> 01:33:47.975
-Félix, excuse me.
-Hi, Violeta. What's up?


1385
01:33:48.143 --> 01:33:49.017
-How are you?
-Good, great.


1386
01:33:49.185 --> 01:33:50.350
I wanted to ask you a favour.

1387
01:33:50.435 --> 01:33:54.184
It's my niece's birthday
and I'd like you to record a video.


1388
01:33:54.351 --> 01:33:55.642
-Do you mind?
-No, no.


1389
01:33:55.810 --> 01:33:57.003
Thanks a lot.

1390
01:33:57.185 --> 01:33:58.684
-What's her name?
-Emilia.


1391
01:33:58.851 --> 01:34:00.225
-Emilia.
-She's turning 15.


1392
01:34:01.893 --> 01:34:03.225
Hello, Emi.

1393
01:34:03.560 --> 01:34:04.684
Happy birthday.

1394
01:34:24.435 --> 01:34:25.642
Indeed!

1395
01:34:25.976 --> 01:34:27.350
How rude.

1396
01:34:29.935 --> 01:34:33.142
You can't leave dishes from
the first round uncollected.


1397
01:34:33.310 --> 01:34:34.642
It's unacceptable.

1398
01:34:34.893 --> 01:34:38.059
I don't know if you're blind
or just idiots.


1399
01:34:38.226 --> 01:34:41.725
So stop running around
like headless chickens and do it.


1400
01:34:41.893 --> 01:34:43.392
Sorry, right away, don't worry.

1401
01:34:43.560 --> 01:34:46.767
No, I do worry.
Of course I worry!


1402
01:34:47.310 --> 01:34:48.517
Don Iván!

1403
01:34:48.685 --> 01:34:50.934
What are you doing here?
Can I help you?


1404
01:34:51.101 --> 01:34:53.225
I need a cigarette,
have you got one?


1405
01:34:55.310 --> 01:34:57.059
I'll smoke with you.

1406
01:35:01.101 --> 01:35:03.975
Now I'm the face
for a charity campaign


1407
01:35:04.143 --> 01:35:08.267
that makes houses for African refugees
from discarded containers.


1408
01:35:08.435 --> 01:35:11.017
You've seen those ship containers.

1409
01:35:11.268 --> 01:35:13.767
They make beautiful houses
out of them.


1410
01:35:13.935 --> 01:35:15.309
They're small,

1411
01:35:15.643 --> 01:35:18.642
-but very beautiful.
-Great.


1412
01:35:19.685 --> 01:35:22.517
Sorry, I have to take
an important call.


1413
01:35:22.768 --> 01:35:23.975
Just a second.

1414
01:35:25.268 --> 01:35:29.767
And in the name of "charisma"
we have to endure horrible actors


1415
01:35:30.018 --> 01:35:32.767
with a lobotomized audience
that adores them.


1416
01:35:32.935 --> 01:35:34.767
It's a vicious circle,
where the audience...


1417
01:35:34.935 --> 01:35:37.517
I'm dying to be with you too,

1418
01:35:37.685 --> 01:35:39.767
but not today, it's impossible.

1419
01:35:39.935 --> 01:35:41.725
Keep that urge for tomorrow.

1420
01:35:41.893 --> 01:35:44.684
And that energy,
you're going to need it.


1421
01:35:44.851 --> 01:35:47.350
Félix is without a doubt
the worst actor


1422
01:35:47.518 --> 01:35:49.309
I've worked with in my life.

1423
01:35:49.476 --> 01:35:53.392
It's incredible that a guy
so lacking in resources


1424
01:35:53.560 --> 01:35:55.350
has had the career he's had.

1425
01:35:55.518 --> 01:35:57.892
Clearly, the film industry

1426
01:35:58.143 --> 01:36:00.767
is too generous, too generous.

1427
01:36:00.935 --> 01:36:05.184
Lola told me
what they're paying him.


1428
01:36:05.393 --> 01:36:07.017
-It's grotesque.
-Right.


1429
01:36:07.476 --> 01:36:08.600
Grotesque.

1430
01:36:08.768 --> 01:36:12.059
And the brute thinks that because
he's paid this obscene amount,


1431
01:36:12.226 --> 01:36:13.767
because it is obscene,

1432
01:36:13.976 --> 01:36:17.809
he's better than those of us who
get paid a reasonable amount.


1433
01:36:18.060 --> 01:36:20.642
I'd never let them pay me
what they pay him.


1434
01:36:20.893 --> 01:36:23.350
It'd be dishonest...

1435
01:36:23.518 --> 01:36:25.642
pornographic, even.

1436
01:36:26.560 --> 01:36:29.392
I totally agree, 
I totally agree.

1437
01:36:29.601 --> 01:36:32.809
One is certainly not
the money one makes.


1438
01:36:32.976 --> 01:36:34.059
I, for example...

1439
01:36:34.226 --> 01:36:37.725
And it's not the first time
I've worked with an idiot.


1440
01:36:37.893 --> 01:36:39.850
I'm used to it.

1441
01:36:40.101 --> 01:36:41.267
But...

1442
01:36:42.060 --> 01:36:45.850
this individual, so to speak,

1443
01:36:46.101 --> 01:36:49.517
has the worst problem
anyone can have:


1444
01:36:49.685 --> 01:36:52.100
He doesn't know
that he doesn't know it.


1445
01:36:53.185 --> 01:36:55.225
He doesn't know
that he doesn't know it.


1446
01:36:55.435 --> 01:36:56.517
Sure.

1447
01:36:56.685 --> 01:36:59.559
Ignorance plus arrogance.
The worst thing.


1448
01:37:00.185 --> 01:37:01.392
The worst thing.

1449
01:37:03.518 --> 01:37:05.100
Anyway...

1450
01:37:05.268 --> 01:37:08.600
I think the main thing now is...

1451
01:37:09.810 --> 01:37:13.225
to focus on the film, isn't it?

1452
01:37:17.685 --> 01:37:19.475
Well, I'm heading down

1453
01:37:19.643 --> 01:37:22.809
because if I'm not there,
it all falls apart.


1454
01:37:22.976 --> 01:37:23.850
Are you coming?

1455
01:37:24.018 --> 01:37:25.059
No, you go.

1456
01:37:25.226 --> 01:37:29.059
I'm fucking sick
of this decadent circus


1457
01:37:29.226 --> 01:37:32.142
of airheads, whores and the corrupt.

1458
01:37:32.310 --> 01:37:33.434
You go.

1459
01:37:35.226 --> 01:37:36.434
It's finished.

1460
01:37:40.476 --> 01:37:43.225
Well, I'll get going.

1461
01:37:51.518 --> 01:37:52.809
Anyway...

1462
01:38:05.310 --> 01:38:06.517
Félix, buddy...

1463
01:38:06.685 --> 01:38:07.642
Right then...

1464
01:38:07.810 --> 01:38:10.809
Say that again,
you old piece of shit.


1465
01:38:10.976 --> 01:38:12.475
You whinger.

1466
01:38:12.643 --> 01:38:15.059
Let's see if your face
really is untouchable.


1467
01:38:15.226 --> 01:38:16.434
Right then...

1468
01:38:26.310 --> 01:38:28.392
Fuck, fuck, fuck.

1469
01:38:48.518 --> 01:38:50.142
Fuck.

1470
01:39:01.643 --> 01:39:04.059
Fuck, fuck, fuck.

1471
01:39:22.435 --> 01:39:23.767
Everyth ing's-fi ne.

1472
01:39:27.351 --> 01:39:28.725
Everything's fine.

1473
01:39:33.393 --> 01:39:35.100
Everything's fine.

1474
01:39:47.726 --> 01:39:49.642
Yes, the Humberto Suárez Foundation.

1475
01:39:49.810 --> 01:39:52.100
It's the third time I've called.

1476
01:39:52.851 --> 01:39:54.267
Yeah, it was me.

1477
01:39:59.310 --> 01:40:01.475
There's a man...!

1478
01:40:04.476 --> 01:40:08.225
Yes, but this is
the third time I've called.


1479
01:40:22.935 --> 01:40:24.309
-What happened?
-He jumped.


1480
01:40:24.476 --> 01:40:27.142
-What?
-Or fell, I don't know.


1481
01:40:28.851 --> 01:40:32.642
How many times do I have to call
for a goddamn ambulance?


1482
01:42:20.060 --> 01:42:22.059
Again, Félix!

1483
01:42:22.768 --> 01:42:23.975
Here, here!

1484
01:42:24.143 --> 01:42:26.809
Félix! Félix!

1485
01:42:39.310 --> 01:42:43.517
<i>RIVALRY</i>
A FILM BY LOLA CUEVAS


1486
01:42:57.768 --> 01:42:59.267
Next question.

1487
01:42:59.768 --> 01:43:00.850
You.

1488
01:43:03.310 --> 01:43:05.767
First of all,
congratulations on the film.


1489
01:43:05.935 --> 01:43:09.892
I saw it at the morning screening
and I was astounded.


1490
01:43:10.060 --> 01:43:12.600
-The question, please.
-Yes, sorry.


1491
01:43:12.768 --> 01:43:14.267
For Lola.

1492
01:43:14.435 --> 01:43:18.267
In your film there is a clear
ideological position,


1493
01:43:18.435 --> 01:43:24.642
a critique of the role of women
within the patriarchal society.


1494
01:43:24.810 --> 01:43:28.142
The position doesn't matter,
if there was one.


1495
01:43:28.851 --> 01:43:29.517
It doesn't matter.

1496
01:43:29.685 --> 01:43:34.392
One has to stop doing
an ideological frisk of everything,


1497
01:43:34.685 --> 01:43:38.975
to stop pigeonholing works
by their presumed ideology.


1498
01:43:39.685 --> 01:43:43.475
The fact that you see
a manifesto in my film


1499
01:43:43.976 --> 01:43:45.934
is rather reductionist,

1500
01:43:47.351 --> 01:43:50.142
to my taste, intellectually lazy.

1501
01:43:50.518 --> 01:43:55.434
A film isn't an affirmation,
an answer to a question,


1502
01:43:55.601 --> 01:43:59.350
just as art does not
refer to something,


1503
01:43:59.518 --> 01:44:02.517
but is a thing in itself.

1504
01:44:06.768 --> 01:44:07.767
Next question.

1505
01:44:10.101 --> 01:44:11.475
You, please.

1506
01:44:14.810 --> 01:44:15.892
Thank you.

1507
01:44:16.310 --> 01:44:18.434
For Félix Rivero.

1508
01:44:19.768 --> 01:44:22.892
Iván Torres was meant to
be your co-star in this film.


1509
01:44:23.060 --> 01:44:25.767
Then tragedy struck.

1510
01:44:26.560 --> 01:44:31.142
How was the experience
of playing both characters?


1511
01:44:31.310 --> 01:44:36.184
Do you have any news
of Iván's state of health?


1512
01:44:36.393 --> 01:44:39.892
They haven't issued
a medical report for some time.


1513
01:44:40.143 --> 01:44:42.600
Beginning with the main thing,

1514
01:44:42.768 --> 01:44:45.559
there is no news on Iván's state.

1515
01:44:46.351 --> 01:44:49.184
He's the same,
in a vegetative state.


1516
01:44:49.768 --> 01:44:53.267
The diagnosis is diff...

1517
01:44:54.435 --> 01:44:57.350
Diffuse axonal injury.

1518
01:44:57.518 --> 01:44:58.475
Exactly.

1519
01:44:58.726 --> 01:45:00.225
Diffuse axonal injury.

1520
01:45:00.393 --> 01:45:03.017
He's in a deep coma,

1521
01:45:03.185 --> 01:45:05.517
no reaction at all, poor man.

1522
01:45:05.685 --> 01:45:09.434
From what the doctors say,
it's irreversible.


1523
01:45:09.935 --> 01:45:12.350
It was a very tough situation,

1524
01:45:12.518 --> 01:45:16.267
I never quite understood
what really happened.


1525
01:45:16.893 --> 01:45:20.767
Iván was a very complex,
tortured person.


1526
01:45:20.935 --> 01:45:23.267
Anyway... Terrible.

1527
01:45:23.810 --> 01:45:26.350
We'll never know
what was going through his head.


1528
01:45:26.518 --> 01:45:28.809
Personally, I'm still,

1529
01:45:29.060 --> 01:45:31.975
as you can imagine, devastated.

1530
01:45:32.518 --> 01:45:35.350
That's why,
when Lola told me her idea,


1531
01:45:35.518 --> 01:45:37.434
brilliant, by the way,

1532
01:45:37.643 --> 01:45:40.225
of playing Iván's character as well,

1533
01:45:40.435 --> 01:45:43.184
I saw it as a tribute.

1534
01:45:44.175 --> 01:45:45.223
And I know,

1535
01:45:45.709 --> 01:45:47.226
I'm certain,

1536
01:45:48.310 --> 01:45:51.267
that he would've done
the same for this film.


1537
01:45:52.143 --> 01:45:54.850
Iván, my dear...

1538
01:46:00.310 --> 01:46:01.892
Thank you so much,

1539
01:46:04.030 --> 01:46:05.566
<i>maestro.</i>

1540
01:46:06.297 --> 01:46:07.532
Friend.

1541
01:46:08.703 --> 01:46:10.018
Brother.

1542
01:46:21.310 --> 01:46:22.517
You.

1543
01:46:25.101 --> 01:46:26.309
For Lola, please.

1544
01:46:26.560 --> 01:46:29.600
Have you imagined what the film
would be with Iván Torres,


1545
01:46:29.768 --> 01:46:33.600
if what unfortunately happened
hadn't happened?


1546
01:46:37.419 --> 01:46:38.548
No.

1547
01:46:43.060 --> 01:46:44.184
Thank you.

1548
01:46:44.726 --> 01:46:46.559
Next question.

1549
01:47:54.560 --> 01:47:57.017
<i>When does a film end?</i>

1550
01:48:00.726 --> 01:48:01.975
<i>Now?</i>

1551
01:48:03.268 --> 01:48:05.850
<i>When the end credits come on?</i>

1552
01:48:08.560 --> 01:48:11.559
<i>At the cinema exit,
when we argue about it?</i>


1553
01:48:13.101 --> 01:48:16.392
<i>The next day,
a month later, a year later?</i>


1554
01:48:20.643 --> 01:48:23.059
<i>Or every time we think about it?</i>

1555
01:48:25.476 --> 01:48:29.392
<i>Some films end
with the closing credits.</i>


1556
01:48:32.351 --> 01:48:33.975
Félix...

1557
01:48:35.226 --> 01:48:36.850
Rivero.

1558
01:48:40.643 --> 01:48:44.642
Fucking son of a bitch.

1559
01:48:45.935 --> 01:48:47.517
<i>But others,</i>

1560
01:48:48.268 --> 01:48:49.434
believe me,

1561
01:48:51.185 --> 01:48:54.309
may never end.
