00:00:44.595 --> 00:00:49.859
<i>Every five years the tribes of the Sahara
race their finest horses.</i>


2
00:00:51.143 --> 00:00:54.984
<i>The race is a great test of stamina
for both horse and rider.</i>


3
00:00:55.522 --> 00:00:58.526
<i>To the victor go the best horses
from the losing tribes,</i>


4
00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:01.699
<i>bringing prestige, wealth and power.</i>

5
00:01:03.655 --> 00:01:07.205
<i>Strongest and fastest of all
is the Black Stallion</i>


6
00:01:07.367 --> 00:01:10.211
<i>who means more than anything
to young Alec Ramsey.</i>


7
00:01:12.122 --> 00:01:13.982
<i>The original Berber owners of the stallion</i>

8
00:01:14.082 --> 00:01:17.469
<i>have come to reclaim their champion
in time for the race.</i>


9
00:01:18.211 --> 00:01:21.594
<i>But there is also
a rogue tribe, the Uruk,</i>

10
00:01:21.715 --> 00:01:25.352
<i>whose evil leader, Kurr,
has come to stop the Black...</i>


11
00:03:32.095 --> 00:03:34.689
There. Want a bite?

12
00:03:53.492 --> 00:03:55.369
Thank you very much, sir.

13
00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:57.917
Purpose of your visit?

14
00:03:58.455 --> 00:04:00.378
We have come for our horse.

15
00:04:03.794 --> 00:04:04.795
This horse?

16
00:04:06.129 --> 00:04:07.255
Yes.

17
00:04:07.881 --> 00:04:09.474
His real name is Shetan.

18
00:04:12.302 --> 00:04:13.704
I doubt that horse is for sale.

19
00:04:13.804 --> 00:04:15.181
We have not come to buy him.

20
00:04:15.388 --> 00:04:16.685
He was stolen from us.

21
00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:19.647
Shufi! Voyons.

22
00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:22.671
Kurr.

23
00:04:22.771 --> 00:04:24.523
We must act tonight.

24
00:05:20.704 --> 00:05:22.702
Shetan, we meet again.

25
00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:44.482
Mom?

26
00:05:47.814 --> 00:05:49.157
Shetan!

27
00:05:50.984 --> 00:05:52.219
What is it, Alec?

28
00:05:52.319 --> 00:05:54.162
I don't know.
There's something wrong with the Black.


29
00:05:57.240 --> 00:05:58.332
Ahh!

30
00:05:59.618 --> 00:06:00.790
Aah!

31
00:06:04.331 --> 00:06:05.753
Ugh! Ugh!

32
00:06:10.837 --> 00:06:11.838
Ah!

33
00:06:17.344 --> 00:06:18.970
Black?

34
00:06:25.101 --> 00:06:27.195
What happened? 
Is he all right?

35
00:06:28.021 --> 00:06:29.364
I think so.

36
00:06:31.983 --> 00:06:33.451
What's the matter?

37
00:06:33.735 --> 00:06:35.783
You're not getting enough attention, huh?

38
00:06:37.447 --> 00:06:38.824
Oh, this horse, Alec...

39
00:06:39.032 --> 00:06:40.934
Why don't you go back to bed?

40
00:06:41.034 --> 00:06:42.102
Oh, no.

41
00:06:42.202 --> 00:06:43.854
You're not sleeping in the barn, Alec.

42
00:06:43.954 --> 00:06:45.956
Sorry. You know the rules.

43
00:06:46.539 --> 00:06:47.665
Come to bed now, Alec.

44
00:06:48.541 --> 00:06:51.044
Shh. It's okay.

45
00:07:18.697 --> 00:07:20.415
I'll be right back.

46
00:08:25.847 --> 00:08:27.474
Mom, fire!

47
00:08:31.061 --> 00:08:32.187
Black!

48
00:08:34.355 --> 00:08:36.983
Alec! Get out of there Alec, right now!

49
00:08:37.358 --> 00:08:39.427
Operator! Operator!

50
00:08:39.527 --> 00:08:41.012
Alec, get out of there!

51
00:08:41.112 --> 00:08:42.489
Alec Ramsey!

52
00:08:44.157 --> 00:08:45.955
Get me the fire department, please!

53
00:08:51.164 --> 00:08:53.337
Alec, are you all right?

54
00:08:53.583 --> 00:08:55.068
- What happened?
- Yeah, I'm fine.


55
00:08:56.503 --> 00:08:57.779
I'll try and save my car.

56
00:08:57.879 --> 00:08:59.426
You be careful!

57
00:09:01.508 --> 00:09:02.509
Try the other side.

58
00:09:05.720 --> 00:09:06.812
Come on.

59
00:09:17.232 --> 00:09:18.905
Easy, boy.

60
00:09:25.448 --> 00:09:26.474
Son, get back.

61
00:09:26.574 --> 00:09:27.700
Please, get back.

62
00:09:28.034 --> 00:09:29.019
- Alec!
- Get back.


63
00:09:29.119 --> 00:09:31.271
- You get away from there right now!
- Is anyone in that barn?


64
00:09:31.371 --> 00:09:32.522
No. Ohh!

65
00:09:32.622 --> 00:09:33.965
Our beautiful barn!

66
00:09:36.793 --> 00:09:37.777
What happened?

67
00:09:37.877 --> 00:09:39.237
I don't know what happened.

68
00:09:39.337 --> 00:09:41.740
The horse got away,
and then it just burst into flames.


69
00:09:41.840 --> 00:09:43.717
- How'd it start?
- Must've been the paint cans.


70
00:09:43.842 --> 00:09:45.368
We were just painting
the side of the barn.


71
00:09:45.468 --> 00:09:48.329
- Are you all right?
- I'm okay, and Alec is fine.


72
00:09:48.429 --> 00:09:50.056
He let the horse out.

73
00:10:10.743 --> 00:10:12.086
Hey, stop!

74
00:10:12.579 --> 00:10:13.580
Stop!

75
00:10:18.918 --> 00:10:19.861
Hey!

76
00:10:19.961 --> 00:10:21.133
Wait!

77
00:10:21.671 --> 00:10:22.718
Black!

78
00:10:34.934 --> 00:10:35.935
Ugh.

79
00:10:40.773 --> 00:10:42.050
Whoa, Black.

80
00:10:42.150 --> 00:10:43.343
Whoa, Black.

81
00:10:43.443 --> 00:10:44.660
Easy, boy.

82
00:10:45.069 --> 00:10:46.286
Easy.

83
00:10:46.863 --> 00:10:47.955
Whoa.

84
00:10:49.949 --> 00:10:50.996
Whoa.

85
00:11:08.843 --> 00:11:09.969
Whoa.

86
00:11:36.079 --> 00:11:37.080
Yah!

87
00:11:45.380 --> 00:11:47.007
Come on, Black!

88
00:12:20.957 --> 00:12:22.675
Shetan!

89
00:12:25.545 --> 00:12:27.889
Come on, Black. Come on. Come on, Black.

90
00:12:41.978 --> 00:12:44.356
I'm Abu Jakub Ben Ishak.

91
00:12:45.064 --> 00:12:47.112
Shetan is our horse.

92
00:12:47.483 --> 00:12:49.761
We are taking him back to Wadi Draa.

93
00:12:49.861 --> 00:12:51.989
But you can't take him! He's mine!

94
00:12:52.572 --> 00:12:54.474
No! No!

95
00:12:54.574 --> 00:12:56.201
No! No!

96
00:12:59.162 --> 00:13:03.417
I am sorry, child,
but the horse must come with me.


97
00:13:04.250 --> 00:13:06.924
The monster that started the fire

98
00:13:07.295 --> 00:13:10.765
will stop at nothing
to prevent Shetan from coming home.


99
00:13:10.923 --> 00:13:12.075
But this is his home!

100
00:13:12.175 --> 00:13:14.473
His home is in the desert with us.

101
00:13:14.594 --> 00:13:16.621
No! You can't take him!

102
00:13:16.721 --> 00:13:18.644
No! No!

103
00:13:18.765 --> 00:13:19.857
Black!

104
00:13:22.310 --> 00:13:23.436
Black!

105
00:13:26.105 --> 00:13:27.106
Black!

106
00:13:31.444 --> 00:13:32.595
Easy. Easy does it.

107
00:13:32.695 --> 00:13:34.117
Hold that rope.

108
00:13:34.781 --> 00:13:35.998
That's it.

109
00:13:39.911 --> 00:13:40.958
Black!

110
00:14:07.814 --> 00:14:08.861
Black?

111
00:14:42.640 --> 00:14:44.417
Alec, where are you?

112
00:14:44.517 --> 00:14:45.752
Alec, can you hear me?

113
00:14:45.852 --> 00:14:47.729
Yeah, Mom. I'm fine.

114
00:14:48.062 --> 00:14:49.756
Don't worry about me, okay?

115
00:14:49.856 --> 00:14:51.733
What do you mean? 
Of course I'm worrying.

116
00:14:52.567 --> 00:14:53.614
Alec?

117
00:14:54.026 --> 00:14:55.152
Alec?

118
00:14:55.736 --> 00:14:56.763
Alec?

119
00:14:56.863 --> 00:14:57.864
Hey, Mom,

120
00:14:58.322 --> 00:14:59.682
I know where the Black is going.

121
00:14:59.782 --> 00:15:00.999
I'm going after him.

122
00:15:01.367 --> 00:15:03.620
Going after him? 
What do you mean?

123
00:15:03.870 --> 00:15:05.713
Alec, come back here.

124
00:15:05.872 --> 00:15:06.919
Alec?

125
00:15:07.999 --> 00:15:09.025
Here it is.

126
00:15:09.125 --> 00:15:10.172
Wadi Draa.

127
00:15:10.793 --> 00:15:11.778
Hmm.

128
00:15:11.878 --> 00:15:13.880
Way out there
in the desert like that, huh?


129
00:15:14.172 --> 00:15:16.391
Closest city is Casablanca.

130
00:15:16.591 --> 00:15:17.934
Casablanca.

131
00:15:18.134 --> 00:15:23.474
Pan American has a clipper ship which flies
twice a week from La Guardia.


132
00:15:24.056 --> 00:15:25.166
Uh...

133
00:15:25.266 --> 00:15:29.087
Today and Friday at 5:00,
and it gets there in 3 days.


134
00:15:29.187 --> 00:15:30.234
Thank you.

135
00:15:36.694 --> 00:15:37.762
- Frank.
- Yeah.


136
00:15:37.862 --> 00:15:40.390
I, ah, want you to take a look
at the hydraulic lift.


137
00:15:57.757 --> 00:15:59.509
Where's your kid stationed now?

138
00:15:59.675 --> 00:16:00.993
Well, he's in Frankfurt.

139
00:16:01.093 --> 00:16:02.265
Frankfurt, huh?

140
00:16:02.428 --> 00:16:03.429
Yup.

141
00:16:16.567 --> 00:16:17.944
Hey, kid, hey.

142
00:16:18.194 --> 00:16:19.946
Hey, you don't belong out there.

143
00:16:20.321 --> 00:16:22.619
You ain't allowed on that scaffolding.

144
00:16:22.740 --> 00:16:24.413
Get back in the ship.

145
00:16:24.825 --> 00:16:26.748
No, no, no, in the ship!

146
00:16:27.787 --> 00:16:29.460
Where you belong
with the rest of the tour.


147
00:16:34.835 --> 00:16:35.820
That's right.

148
00:16:35.920 --> 00:16:37.638
Inside, inside.

149
00:16:39.298 --> 00:16:41.409
This plane is going to Casablanca, right?

150
00:16:41.509 --> 00:16:43.227
Yeah, that's right.

151
00:16:45.888 --> 00:16:47.707
Each engine is accessible for maintenance.

152
00:16:47.807 --> 00:16:49.959
- You mean you can go inside them?
- That's right.


153
00:16:50.059 --> 00:16:52.920
A flight engineer can enter the wing
through a port on the flight deck,


154
00:16:53.020 --> 00:16:55.193
if emergency repairs are necessary.

155
00:16:55.481 --> 00:16:58.050
But in 6 years it's never been needed.

156
00:16:58.150 --> 00:17:00.152
Now, if you'd like to move forward...

157
00:17:01.487 --> 00:17:02.488
The engines drive

158
00:17:02.655 --> 00:17:03.656
4 Hamilton...

159
00:17:22.174 --> 00:17:23.676
Yeah, I got it.

160
00:17:24.218 --> 00:17:25.686
I'll be back up for the other case.

161
00:17:31.225 --> 00:17:33.978
We could replace the whole door,
but I think just a nut'll do it.


162
00:17:48.492 --> 00:17:49.664
Okay.

163
00:19:56.328 --> 00:19:58.547
Hey, get out of there.

164
00:19:58.748 --> 00:20:00.671
How long you been in there?

165
00:20:02.293 --> 00:20:03.527
I don't know.

166
00:20:03.627 --> 00:20:05.004
I got in, in New York.

167
00:20:05.671 --> 00:20:07.173
How'd you get in there?

168
00:20:07.882 --> 00:20:09.225
I just climbed in.

169
00:20:11.844 --> 00:20:13.642
Are you gonna eat that piece of bread?

170
00:20:13.763 --> 00:20:14.935
What?

171
00:20:15.473 --> 00:20:18.101
'Cause... 'Cause if you're not,
I'd like to have it.


172
00:20:18.976 --> 00:20:20.102
Sure.

173
00:20:47.129 --> 00:20:48.781
Our stowaway.

174
00:20:48.881 --> 00:20:50.133
Hmph!

175
00:20:53.135 --> 00:20:56.598
If you were mine, I'd make
your bottom very sore, Mon petit.


176
00:21:17.034 --> 00:21:18.853
Be sure you don't leave these walls.

177
00:21:18.953 --> 00:21:21.832
You're going back to your mother
on the clipper tomorrow.


178
00:21:28.254 --> 00:21:30.427
Are there any horses around here?

179
00:21:31.590 --> 00:21:32.658
A horse.

180
00:21:32.758 --> 00:21:33.930
Horses.

181
00:21:37.388 --> 00:21:38.715
Oui.

182
00:21:38.815 --> 00:21:42.351
- Un cheval?
- Oui, oui, un cheval.


183
00:21:46.146 --> 00:21:47.614
Magnifique, non?

184
00:21:47.815 --> 00:21:49.613
Oui, oui.

185
00:21:49.942 --> 00:21:51.410
C'est Le cheval Du colonel.

186
00:21:51.777 --> 00:21:54.955
Oui! My cheval more big,
more m-m-magnifique.


187
00:21:55.239 --> 00:21:56.849
- Black.
- Black?


188
00:21:56.949 --> 00:21:58.201
Oui, Black.

189
00:21:58.784 --> 00:21:59.956
The Black.

190
00:22:00.202 --> 00:22:01.294
Black?

191
00:22:04.957 --> 00:22:05.941
The Shetan.

192
00:22:06.041 --> 00:22:07.723
Shetan?

193
00:22:13.340 --> 00:22:14.387
Viens.

194
00:22:24.643 --> 00:22:25.815
C'est bon.

195
00:22:26.353 --> 00:22:27.570
Tuareg.

196
00:22:49.084 --> 00:22:51.257
Doucement, doucement.

197
00:23:28.540 --> 00:23:29.632
No, no.

198
00:23:29.875 --> 00:23:30.876
No?

199
00:23:56.193 --> 00:24:00.288
I know you from photographs
in American newspapers.


200
00:24:00.531 --> 00:24:02.249
You won the big match race.

201
00:24:02.783 --> 00:24:05.081
Come, look who we have here.

202
00:24:05.244 --> 00:24:07.417
I've been hoping of news of Shetan.

203
00:24:07.705 --> 00:24:09.106
He was kidnapped.

204
00:24:09.206 --> 00:24:11.584
Yes, I know. By Sahid Ben Ishak.

205
00:24:11.750 --> 00:24:13.694
- Do you know him?
- Never mind what I know.


206
00:24:13.794 --> 00:24:15.154
What do you know?

207
00:24:15.254 --> 00:24:16.551
What is this?

208
00:24:16.922 --> 00:24:22.228
This is the symbol of the Uruk, simply
the most powerful tribe in the desert.


209
00:24:22.594 --> 00:24:25.188
How did Ben Ishak
and Shetan leave America?


210
00:24:25.431 --> 00:24:27.458
On a ship called the Casablanca.

211
00:24:27.558 --> 00:24:29.105
Ah, yes.

212
00:24:29.393 --> 00:24:30.940
I shall catch them in Sulaiyil.

213
00:24:31.437 --> 00:24:33.439
We must leave immediately.

214
00:24:34.773 --> 00:24:35.841
Who are you after?

215
00:24:35.941 --> 00:24:37.113
Black?

216
00:24:38.402 --> 00:24:40.154
I am after victory.

217
00:24:40.779 --> 00:24:41.996
Power.

218
00:24:42.156 --> 00:24:45.459
Power to the Uruk
for the first time in history.


219
00:24:46.326 --> 00:24:47.452
Start the motor.

220
00:24:47.828 --> 00:24:49.296
You have been very helpful.

221
00:24:51.790 --> 00:24:52.775
Hey!

222
00:24:52.875 --> 00:24:55.256
I scratched your back,
now you scratch mine.


223
00:24:55.794 --> 00:24:56.920
What does this mean?

224
00:24:57.087 --> 00:24:58.179
Where's Sulaiyil?

225
00:24:58.922 --> 00:25:00.424
An oasis in the desert.

226
00:25:01.133 --> 00:25:03.077
The only way to Wadi Draa.

227
00:25:03.177 --> 00:25:05.646
Ben Ishak must stop there for water.

228
00:25:05.804 --> 00:25:07.056
And now I must depart.

229
00:25:07.556 --> 00:25:08.624
Please take me with you.

230
00:25:08.724 --> 00:25:09.850
Peace be with you.

231
00:25:10.309 --> 00:25:11.902
- Allez!
- Wait, look!


232
00:25:14.521 --> 00:25:16.194
Where you got this?

233
00:25:16.523 --> 00:25:17.883
Why? You want it?

234
00:25:17.983 --> 00:25:19.826
I must have, yes.

235
00:25:20.819 --> 00:25:22.696
Then take me with you.

236
00:25:24.114 --> 00:25:25.240
A deal?

237
00:25:26.325 --> 00:25:27.326
Right.

238
00:25:27.659 --> 00:25:28.831
Ah! Allez.

239
00:25:48.388 --> 00:25:50.015
I see you make great progress.

240
00:25:51.100 --> 00:25:52.847
I will finish.

241
00:25:53.852 --> 00:25:54.853
Le camion.

242
00:25:55.145 --> 00:25:56.146
Eh?

243
00:25:59.024 --> 00:26:00.321
Trucks are the future, you know.

244
00:26:01.360 --> 00:26:03.454
Roads across the mountains.

245
00:26:07.366 --> 00:26:08.743
Imbecile!

246
00:26:11.662 --> 00:26:14.710
Great highways crisscrossing the desert.

247
00:26:15.374 --> 00:26:17.547
You want the desert to look like that?

248
00:26:17.751 --> 00:26:19.719
I want progress.

249
00:26:19.878 --> 00:26:20.879
Change.

250
00:26:21.255 --> 00:26:23.132
Change in the tribal leadership.

251
00:26:23.841 --> 00:26:28.808
Soon you will learn the old ways
of the Berbers, the ridiculous traditions.


252
00:26:29.138 --> 00:26:33.104
Ask an honorable man to be his guest,
no man would refuse.


253
00:26:33.225 --> 00:26:34.226
How stupid!

254
00:26:34.393 --> 00:26:37.171
Ask a man for protection,
no harm will come to you.


255
00:26:37.271 --> 00:26:38.397
What nonsense!

256
00:26:38.772 --> 00:26:41.863
I will destroy those traditions,
once and for all.


257
00:26:41.984 --> 00:26:43.031
Hey! Aide-moi.

258
00:26:50.909 --> 00:26:52.306
Hey, what's so funny?

259
00:27:02.296 --> 00:27:03.388
The medallion.

260
00:27:04.173 --> 00:27:05.324
But we're not in Sulaiyil yet.

261
00:27:05.424 --> 00:27:06.471
Give it to me!

262
00:27:12.222 --> 00:27:13.223
I drive.

263
00:27:20.439 --> 00:27:22.640
But we had a deal.

264
00:27:25.944 --> 00:27:27.137
What about me?

265
00:27:27.237 --> 00:27:28.284
What about you?

266
00:27:29.448 --> 00:27:32.580
If you ever see this again, stop.

267
00:27:32.868 --> 00:27:35.712
The Uruks are something to fear.

268
00:27:40.209 --> 00:27:41.886
I want to be your guest.

269
00:27:43.670 --> 00:27:45.764
You said no one would refuse me.

270
00:27:45.964 --> 00:27:49.309
I said no honorable man would refuse.

271
00:28:46.358 --> 00:28:47.384
Hey!

272
00:28:47.484 --> 00:28:49.202
Hey... Hey...

273
00:28:53.490 --> 00:28:54.537
Hey, water.

274
00:29:06.628 --> 00:29:07.675
Thank you.

275
00:29:36.950 --> 00:29:38.418
Does anybody speak English?

276
00:29:38.744 --> 00:29:40.995
- English?
- English.


277
00:29:51.298 --> 00:29:52.324
English!

278
00:29:52.424 --> 00:29:53.550
Uh, Shetan.

279
00:29:54.301 --> 00:29:55.427
Shetan, Shetan.

280
00:29:55.844 --> 00:29:57.120
Hey, wait a minute. Wait!

281
00:29:57.220 --> 00:29:58.437
Where are you going?

282
00:29:58.889 --> 00:29:59.936
Does anybody know...

283
00:30:02.267 --> 00:30:03.752
Please... Keep quiet.

284
00:30:03.852 --> 00:30:05.354
- You speak English.
- Shh!


285
00:30:05.604 --> 00:30:07.072
You must not let them know.

286
00:30:08.065 --> 00:30:11.600
Take this fruit. 
Sit next to me.

287
00:30:38.637 --> 00:30:40.639
You lie still and listen.

288
00:30:44.810 --> 00:30:46.027
My name is Raj.

289
00:30:46.853 --> 00:30:48.230
I'm Alec Ramsey.

290
00:30:49.064 --> 00:30:50.566
Where did you learn English?

291
00:30:51.316 --> 00:30:52.317
In school.

292
00:30:52.526 --> 00:30:54.369
I'm on my way back from university.

293
00:30:56.446 --> 00:30:57.948
What do you know of Shetan?

294
00:30:58.407 --> 00:30:59.454
He's my horse.

295
00:30:59.950 --> 00:31:02.373
Shetan belongs to Jakub Abu Ben Ishak.

296
00:31:02.994 --> 00:31:06.043
Mr. Ben Ishak, he kidnapped
him from me in New York.


297
00:31:08.750 --> 00:31:10.127
Ben Ishak has him?

298
00:31:10.335 --> 00:31:11.737
Yeah, he's taking him to Wadi Draa.

299
00:31:11.837 --> 00:31:13.113
Shh! Speak softly.

300
00:31:13.213 --> 00:31:14.886
I'm trying to get to Sulaiyil.

301
00:31:16.007 --> 00:31:17.509
Do you know where that's at?

302
00:31:18.051 --> 00:31:19.052
Of course.

303
00:31:19.386 --> 00:31:20.854
Is this truck gonna go there?

304
00:31:21.221 --> 00:31:22.268
No.

305
00:31:22.597 --> 00:31:24.270
Will you go there?

306
00:31:24.516 --> 00:31:25.517
No.

307
00:31:26.143 --> 00:31:27.127
Can I walk there?

308
00:31:27.227 --> 00:31:28.604
Never. You must have a camel.

309
00:31:28.728 --> 00:31:31.089
Wh... What is a child like you
doing here alone?


310
00:31:31.189 --> 00:31:32.941
Why don't you go back to America?

311
00:31:49.708 --> 00:31:51.225
Hey, where are you going?

312
00:32:39.549 --> 00:32:40.766
Where are you going?

313
00:32:41.927 --> 00:32:42.911
Go away.

314
00:32:43.011 --> 00:32:44.388
You cannot come with me.

315
00:32:45.013 --> 00:32:48.083
You... You will not wait long.
Other trucks, they will pass this way.


316
00:32:48.183 --> 00:32:49.275
What about you?

317
00:32:51.770 --> 00:32:52.987
I'm meeting someone.

318
00:32:53.522 --> 00:32:54.506
I'll wait with you.

319
00:32:54.606 --> 00:32:55.858
No. Go away from me.

320
00:32:58.318 --> 00:32:59.319
Stop!

321
00:32:59.444 --> 00:33:00.429
I'm hot.

322
00:33:00.529 --> 00:33:02.702
You stop! You must wet your head cloth.

323
00:33:03.114 --> 00:33:05.833
Four men could've drunk
from what you spill on the ground.


324
00:33:09.204 --> 00:33:11.878
You'd be wise to return to
your people as soon as possible.


325
00:33:13.208 --> 00:33:14.460
Not without my horse.

326
00:33:15.961 --> 00:33:18.055
Shetan is not yours.

327
00:33:18.797 --> 00:33:20.299
He belongs to this desert.

328
00:33:21.258 --> 00:33:22.475
You must forget him.

329
00:33:23.760 --> 00:33:24.761
But I can't.

330
00:33:26.930 --> 00:33:29.479
And what do you think will happen
if you get to Wadi Draa?


331
00:33:30.016 --> 00:33:32.269
Do you think Ben Ishak will
give you back the horse?


332
00:33:32.811 --> 00:33:36.486
Do you think you can bring the horse back
across the desert on your own?


333
00:33:37.983 --> 00:33:38.984
I don't know.

334
00:34:38.793 --> 00:34:39.794
Who is it?

335
00:34:40.629 --> 00:34:42.757
Meslar. He'll take me home.

336
00:34:43.715 --> 00:34:45.433
Take you home? 
Is he your father?

337
00:34:45.800 --> 00:34:46.847
No.

338
00:34:47.135 --> 00:34:48.603
He will keep me from harm.

339
00:35:10.575 --> 00:35:11.667
Americeni.

340
00:35:14.245 --> 00:35:15.246
Americeni?

341
00:35:22.587 --> 00:35:24.510
He thought you were one of his people.

342
00:35:24.631 --> 00:35:26.783
When you did not answer him,
he was deeply insulted.


343
00:35:29.135 --> 00:35:30.682
He asks for your forgiveness.

344
00:35:31.096 --> 00:35:32.122
Uh... Sure.

345
00:35:32.222 --> 00:35:33.849
Tell him not to worry about it.

346
00:35:40.363 --> 00:35:42.210
I'll give you some dates.

347
00:35:42.357 --> 00:35:44.550
If you turn back, there is no danger.

348
00:35:45.276 --> 00:35:47.178
Please take me with you to Sulaiyil.

349
00:35:47.278 --> 00:35:48.972
Please don't go without me.

350
00:35:49.072 --> 00:35:51.374
I've got to find my horse.

351
00:35:56.746 --> 00:35:58.123
I want to be your guest.

352
00:36:00.125 --> 00:36:01.126
And his, too.

353
00:36:02.377 --> 00:36:04.220
I want to be under your protection.

354
00:36:07.173 --> 00:36:08.174
Oh.

355
00:36:10.802 --> 00:36:11.894
We cannot refuse.

356
00:36:12.721 --> 00:36:13.768
But you remember.

357
00:36:14.305 --> 00:36:16.353
A guest must also honor his host.

358
00:36:25.650 --> 00:36:27.493
As-salaam alaikum!

359
00:36:29.320 --> 00:36:30.663
As-salaam alaikum!

360
00:36:59.517 --> 00:37:00.734
Come on, Abdul.

361
00:38:07.418 --> 00:38:10.113
It is believed that sitting
under a thorn bush


362
00:38:10.213 --> 00:38:13.600
will give sight to evil creatures
that Allah has blinded.


363
00:38:14.259 --> 00:38:18.429
And the Tuareg believes that throwing
a pebble will keep them blinded.


364
00:38:19.764 --> 00:38:21.141
And do you believe that?

365
00:38:22.559 --> 00:38:25.187
You do not see me
throwing a pebble, do you?


366
00:38:30.942 --> 00:38:32.535
He's a child.

367
00:38:36.990 --> 00:38:37.991
Alec.

368
00:38:46.624 --> 00:38:49.594
Home, home on the range

369
00:38:50.795 --> 00:38:55.346
Where the deer and the antelope play

370
00:38:56.134 --> 00:38:58.557
Where seldom is heard

371
00:38:58.845 --> 00:39:00.973
A discouraging word

372
00:39:01.973 --> 00:39:06.194
And the skies are not cloudy all day

373
00:39:07.770 --> 00:39:10.774
Home, home on the range

374
00:39:18.990 --> 00:39:19.933
Hear me.

375
00:39:20.033 --> 00:39:23.252
We're coming to the oasis at Sulaiyil.
I am in danger from the Uruk.


376
00:39:23.661 --> 00:39:25.230
- Uruk?
- Just do as you're told,


377
00:39:25.330 --> 00:39:26.815
and we will evade them.

378
00:39:26.915 --> 00:39:28.107
Keep your face covered.

379
00:39:28.207 --> 00:39:30.175
Everyone will believe you are a Tuareg.

380
00:39:30.627 --> 00:39:34.339
If anyone speaks to you, you answer
with this gesture Meslar makes.


381
00:39:37.133 --> 00:39:38.284
It means you cannot speak.

382
00:39:38.384 --> 00:39:39.385
You have no tongue.

383
00:39:53.274 --> 00:39:54.321
Black?

384
00:40:25.640 --> 00:40:27.688
You must not leave our sight.

385
00:40:28.476 --> 00:40:30.169
But I thought I saw the Black, Raj.

386
00:40:30.269 --> 00:40:31.963
Abu Ben Ishak is not stupid.

387
00:40:32.063 --> 00:40:34.486
He would not bring
Shetan here in the daylight.


388
00:40:35.900 --> 00:40:36.901
How come?

389
00:40:37.902 --> 00:40:39.279
The Uruk, child.

390
00:41:37.795 --> 00:41:39.843
Raj! Uruk! Uruk!

391
00:41:41.632 --> 00:41:42.633
Whoo!

392
00:41:46.763 --> 00:41:48.039
Kurr! He is here.

393
00:41:48.139 --> 00:41:49.982
Alec, come here!

394
00:41:51.059 --> 00:41:52.543
Alec, come back. 
I am your friend.

395
00:41:52.643 --> 00:41:53.836
Do not run away from me!

396
00:41:53.936 --> 00:41:54.937
Damn you!

397
00:41:59.984 --> 00:42:00.985
Alec!

398
00:42:01.319 --> 00:42:02.320
Wait!

399
00:42:03.613 --> 00:42:04.614
Come here.

400
00:42:06.032 --> 00:42:07.033
Follow me.

401
00:42:12.330 --> 00:42:13.356
Ben Ishak!

402
00:42:13.456 --> 00:42:14.503
Win Ben Ishak?

403
00:42:17.001 --> 00:42:18.674
Shetan. He is here.

404
00:42:20.213 --> 00:42:21.280
To the well!

405
00:42:21.380 --> 00:42:22.677
I must have Shetan!

406
00:42:28.054 --> 00:42:30.415
You and I must go
to the edge of the oasis.


407
00:42:30.515 --> 00:42:31.687
We must escape the Uruk.

408
00:42:32.225 --> 00:42:33.522
But what about the Black?

409
00:42:33.684 --> 00:42:37.262
Child, there is nothing
can be done now. Follow!


410
00:42:53.037 --> 00:42:54.038
Come on.

411
00:43:02.046 --> 00:43:03.047
Stay down!

412
00:43:04.048 --> 00:43:05.140
We are safe here.

413
00:43:06.092 --> 00:43:07.469
We will wait for Meslar.

414
00:43:08.970 --> 00:43:10.392
I don't understand.

415
00:43:19.480 --> 00:43:20.527
Black?

416
00:43:27.113 --> 00:43:28.456
- Black!
- No!


417
00:43:38.749 --> 00:43:39.841
Black!

418
00:44:03.941 --> 00:44:05.534
Shetan!

419
00:44:31.636 --> 00:44:32.637
No!

420
00:44:32.845 --> 00:44:33.937
No!

421
00:44:34.889 --> 00:44:35.936
Black!

422
00:44:36.557 --> 00:44:37.604
No!

423
00:44:51.239 --> 00:44:52.331
Here.

424
00:44:52.907 --> 00:44:54.159
No, take the tea.

425
00:44:54.617 --> 00:44:55.869
It will calm you.

426
00:44:56.535 --> 00:44:57.832
Your Black is safe now.

427
00:44:58.329 --> 00:45:00.064
The Uruk dare not follow Ben Ishak.

428
00:45:00.164 --> 00:45:01.399
He and his men are too strong.

429
00:45:01.499 --> 00:45:02.500
The Uruk are cowards.

430
00:45:13.970 --> 00:45:15.938
I gotta find my horse, Raj.

431
00:45:17.640 --> 00:45:18.687
I know.

432
00:45:20.017 --> 00:45:24.029
But did you ever think
that maybe your horse


433
00:45:24.188 --> 00:45:28.196
is better off living here,
in the desert, where he belongs?


434
00:45:28.317 --> 00:45:29.739
He belongs with me.

435
00:45:58.723 --> 00:45:59.724
Raj!

436
00:45:59.974 --> 00:46:00.975
Raj!

437
00:46:06.147 --> 00:46:07.740
Meslar says there is no water.

438
00:46:25.708 --> 00:46:27.335
The Uruk. Quickly!

439
00:46:55.029 --> 00:46:56.781
Come Alec! We must go!

440
00:46:56.906 --> 00:46:58.658
Meslar will protect us. Come!

441
00:47:01.577 --> 00:47:05.582
Yaah!

442
00:47:35.820 --> 00:47:36.821
Allah!

443
00:48:48.559 --> 00:48:49.776
Where are we going?

444
00:48:50.102 --> 00:48:51.194
To Sulaiyil.

445
00:48:51.896 --> 00:48:53.773
Sulaiyil? What about Wadi Draa?

446
00:48:54.523 --> 00:48:56.070
You will be safe in Sulaiyil.

447
00:48:56.358 --> 00:48:58.736
In the desert,
you will have feet of butter.


448
00:48:58.986 --> 00:49:00.488
Don't worry about me.

449
00:49:01.405 --> 00:49:02.452
You are my guest.

450
00:49:02.907 --> 00:49:04.454
You are under my protection.

451
00:49:04.909 --> 00:49:06.911
So what do you think's
gonna happen in Sulaiyil?


452
00:49:07.244 --> 00:49:09.647
The Uruk were waiting for Mr. Ben Ishak.

453
00:49:09.747 --> 00:49:12.216
I bet they're still there,
expecting you to come back.


454
00:49:13.250 --> 00:49:15.924
I don't know about you,
but I ain't going back there.


455
00:49:16.086 --> 00:49:18.760
If the Black's in Wadi Draa,
then that's where I'm going.


456
00:49:19.507 --> 00:49:21.659
Oh! And...
And how far do you think you'll get?


457
00:49:21.759 --> 00:49:22.785
All the way.

458
00:49:22.885 --> 00:49:23.977
You are a child!

459
00:49:25.554 --> 00:49:28.437
You're the child. You're the one
who can't move without a bodyguard.


460
00:49:36.232 --> 00:49:37.324
Alec.

461
00:49:37.441 --> 00:49:38.488
Wait.

462
00:49:53.123 --> 00:49:54.170
Come.

463
00:50:30.869 --> 00:50:31.961
Wow!

464
00:50:34.248 --> 00:50:35.465
You may have it.

465
00:50:37.501 --> 00:50:39.424
In exchange for Meslar's sword.

466
00:50:40.421 --> 00:50:42.014
I'm ready to carry it now.

467
00:51:32.723 --> 00:51:34.066
She is the mother horse.

468
00:51:36.393 --> 00:51:40.231
It is said that
all horses come from her.

469
00:51:42.149 --> 00:51:46.411
And to touch her, will make a rider
be one with his horse,


470
00:51:56.205 --> 00:51:57.832
and give me skill to win the race.

471
00:51:58.916 --> 00:52:00.509
You're riding in the race?

472
00:52:01.794 --> 00:52:02.795
Yes.

473
00:52:04.088 --> 00:52:09.101
That is why I'm going home,
and why the Uruk wish to stop me.


474
00:52:09.593 --> 00:52:12.437
For the same reason
they wish to stop Shetan...


475
00:52:12.763 --> 00:52:17.317
Because Ben Ishak's clan
and my father's clan have won many times.


476
00:52:18.102 --> 00:52:19.775
Is there a race every year?

477
00:52:19.937 --> 00:52:21.280
Every five years.

478
00:52:21.730 --> 00:52:23.448
Every desert tribe lives for it.

479
00:52:23.941 --> 00:52:28.203
We train and... and breed
for five years, for stamina and speed.


480
00:52:29.738 --> 00:52:33.033
If we lose, we
lose more than the race.

481
00:52:33.450 --> 00:52:35.123
We lose the best from our herd.

482
00:52:37.454 --> 00:52:40.048
You mean Mr. Ben Ishak
could lose the Black?


483
00:52:41.583 --> 00:52:44.132
If Shetan loses the race, yes.

484
00:52:46.547 --> 00:52:48.094
And the Uruk could win him?

485
00:52:48.298 --> 00:52:49.925
No, ha! Never.

486
00:52:50.384 --> 00:52:52.807
The Uruk horses are rogues with no heart.

487
00:52:54.221 --> 00:52:55.643
But there will be other horses.

488
00:52:56.223 --> 00:52:58.692
Some, perhaps,
with greater heart than Shetan.


489
00:53:06.650 --> 00:53:08.323
Raj, are we going to make it?

490
00:53:38.140 --> 00:53:39.437
The well is dry.

491
00:54:04.708 --> 00:54:05.755
Hey, water!

492
00:54:52.881 --> 00:54:54.975
Raj, is she gonna be all right?

493
00:54:56.969 --> 00:54:58.812
She's weak.

494
00:55:41.054 --> 00:55:42.055
Her...

495
00:55:42.180 --> 00:55:45.476
Flesh... Will give us
a few more hours of life.


496
00:57:31.581 --> 00:57:32.582
Raj!

497
00:57:34.251 --> 00:57:35.252
Raj!

498
00:57:37.629 --> 00:57:38.676
Hey, Raj!

499
00:58:17.294 --> 00:58:18.295
Wait a minute.

500
00:59:14.726 --> 00:59:15.773
Here is Sagr.

501
00:59:16.353 --> 00:59:17.821
Raj, she's beautiful.

502
00:59:18.980 --> 00:59:20.232
You will ride with me.

503
00:59:34.704 --> 00:59:35.956
I can go no further.

504
00:59:37.040 --> 00:59:39.088
I am not welcome in Ben Ishak's kingdom.

505
00:59:40.043 --> 00:59:41.761
Follow this gorge to your Black.

506
00:59:49.219 --> 00:59:50.345
For your journey.

507
00:59:55.976 --> 00:59:58.399
If you ever again wish
to cross the desert, Alec,


508
00:59:59.229 --> 01:00:02.449
I would consider it a great
privilege to accompany you.


509
01:00:03.483 --> 01:00:04.530
Me, too.

510
01:00:31.052 --> 01:00:32.304
Bye. Raj!

511
01:00:35.640 --> 01:00:36.641
Bye, Alec!

512
01:02:12.570 --> 01:02:13.617
Black!

513
01:03:53.838 --> 01:03:54.839
Whoa, Black.

514
01:04:03.056 --> 01:04:04.649
Let go of me!

515
01:04:05.141 --> 01:04:06.142
Black!

516
01:04:07.852 --> 01:04:09.104
Let go of me!

517
01:04:14.692 --> 01:04:15.739
Black!

518
01:04:19.906 --> 01:04:21.499
Easy, boy.

519
01:04:36.798 --> 01:04:37.799
Black?

520
01:05:25.472 --> 01:05:31.111
Young man, you are courageous
to have come this far.


521
01:05:31.853 --> 01:05:33.446
I came for my horse.

522
01:05:34.105 --> 01:05:36.824
I have told you before,
he's not your horse.


523
01:05:37.150 --> 01:05:38.902
And you may not stay here.

524
01:05:40.528 --> 01:05:42.201
But I want to be your guest.

525
01:05:46.242 --> 01:05:49.291
You are resourceful, young man.

526
01:05:49.704 --> 01:05:51.627
You know I cannot refuse.

527
01:05:51.915 --> 01:05:54.839
But, you will do nothing

528
01:05:55.376 --> 01:05:56.923
to interfere with Shetan.

529
01:06:07.805 --> 01:06:09.352
You may rest here.

530
01:06:09.474 --> 01:06:10.771
Thank you.

531
01:06:45.301 --> 01:06:46.427
Good morning, sir.

532
01:07:14.581 --> 01:07:16.675
Here is Aisha.

533
01:07:18.251 --> 01:07:19.594
Now, Aisha

534
01:07:20.169 --> 01:07:22.342
is Shetan's dam.

535
01:07:22.839 --> 01:07:27.511
After the last race, she was taken
from me by the winner, Abdel Rahman.


536
01:07:27.802 --> 01:07:32.140
She was heavy with her first foal, Shetan.

537
01:07:33.725 --> 01:07:37.644
I had to trade many,
many horses to get her back.


538
01:07:37.745 --> 01:07:42.300
For I knew that this foal
was to be the culmination


539
01:07:42.400 --> 01:07:44.198
of all our efforts.

540
01:07:44.694 --> 01:07:48.536
I have sacrificed the wealth of my people

541
01:07:48.865 --> 01:07:50.833
for this one horse.

542
01:07:51.117 --> 01:07:52.539
I cannot fail.

543
01:07:53.703 --> 01:07:56.706
If you really want the Black to win,
you should let me ride him.


544
01:07:57.206 --> 01:08:01.173
Your offer is very kind,
but he will be ridden


545
01:08:02.128 --> 01:08:04.551
by the best rider of my tribe.

546
01:08:15.058 --> 01:08:17.231
There is Shetan's rider.

547
01:08:30.448 --> 01:08:31.449
Yah!

548
01:08:50.426 --> 01:08:51.411
Whoa!

549
01:08:51.511 --> 01:08:52.537
Whoa!

550
01:08:52.637 --> 01:08:53.684
Whoa!

551
01:08:55.390 --> 01:08:56.767
Yah! Yah!

552
01:09:33.553 --> 01:09:36.139
So, you are surprised?

553
01:09:37.265 --> 01:09:38.266
Well, yeah.

554
01:09:38.474 --> 01:09:40.818
But I wasn't riding the Black, you know.

555
01:09:41.936 --> 01:09:45.949
It is said that for every great horse,
there is but one rider.


556
01:09:46.315 --> 01:09:48.534
I am Shetan's rider.

557
01:09:50.486 --> 01:09:51.533
I don't think so.

558
01:10:26.439 --> 01:10:27.440
Easy, Black.

559
01:10:27.815 --> 01:10:29.032
You must not interfere!

560
01:10:48.044 --> 01:10:49.091
No, Black!

561
01:10:52.840 --> 01:10:53.841
Shetan!

562
01:11:04.227 --> 01:11:08.773
Among Berbers, there is a time
to welcome a guest,


563
01:11:10.274 --> 01:11:12.572
and a time to bid him good-bye.

564
01:11:14.737 --> 01:11:15.763
What do you mean?

565
01:11:15.863 --> 01:11:21.123
I have arranged an escort
to accompany you to Casablanca.


566
01:11:23.788 --> 01:11:24.835
Tomorrow.

567
01:11:25.331 --> 01:11:26.315
Tomorrow?

568
01:11:26.415 --> 01:11:29.294
I have asked you not
to interfere with Shetan.


569
01:11:30.336 --> 01:11:31.588
You are confusing him.

570
01:11:31.921 --> 01:11:34.299
You should let me ride him for you.

571
01:11:35.424 --> 01:11:38.936
You are a threat to my people.

572
01:11:41.806 --> 01:11:43.774
You will leave tomorrow.

573
01:12:08.457 --> 01:12:10.630
I wish to speak
to you for a moment.

574
01:12:20.636 --> 01:12:22.663
I know that you believe
your love for Shetan


575
01:12:22.763 --> 01:12:26.392
is more important than anything,
but you are wrong.


576
01:12:27.143 --> 01:12:29.987
The survival of my
people is more important.


577
01:12:30.730 --> 01:12:33.108
You would be very selfish to deny this.

578
01:12:36.319 --> 01:12:39.163
I've not been with Shetan
since he was stolen.


579
01:12:39.780 --> 01:12:40.781
You know him.

580
01:12:42.199 --> 01:12:43.246
So?

581
01:12:44.201 --> 01:12:48.168
I think my grandfather might
let you stay for the race if...


582
01:12:48.497 --> 01:12:49.840
You help me with Sh...

583
01:12:50.082 --> 01:12:51.504
The Black tonight.

584
01:12:52.752 --> 01:12:54.254
What do you mean, help you?

585
01:12:55.046 --> 01:12:57.299
I must be able to ride him, Alec.

586
01:13:24.533 --> 01:13:25.830
Whoa, there.

587
01:13:26.285 --> 01:13:27.377
Whoa.

588
01:13:34.710 --> 01:13:35.778
How are you?

589
01:13:35.878 --> 01:13:36.970
Huh?

590
01:13:49.809 --> 01:13:51.903
I think he's gonna like you fine.

591
01:13:52.019 --> 01:13:53.692
Will you help me on him?

592
01:13:55.231 --> 01:13:56.232
Now?

593
01:13:56.732 --> 01:13:58.325
There's so little time, Alec.

594
01:14:18.754 --> 01:14:19.755
Whoa!

595
01:14:20.423 --> 01:14:22.551
Oh, you!

596
01:14:27.304 --> 01:14:28.351
Shetan!

597
01:14:32.727 --> 01:14:34.053
Oh!

598
01:14:46.657 --> 01:14:47.829
I will try again.

599
01:14:56.584 --> 01:14:57.585
The Uruk.

600
01:14:58.169 --> 01:15:00.547
Alec, the Uruk, they're after Shetan!

601
01:15:01.464 --> 01:15:03.307
Alec, that way! Go that way.

602
01:15:16.312 --> 01:15:17.359
Come on, Black!

603
01:15:17.646 --> 01:15:20.320
Come on, Black! Come on, Black!

604
01:16:49.655 --> 01:16:51.139
Hey!

605
01:17:02.251 --> 01:17:03.343
Shetan...

606
01:17:03.919 --> 01:17:05.262
Met.

607
01:17:14.263 --> 01:17:15.310
Black!

608
01:17:24.773 --> 01:17:25.820
Whoa, Black!

609
01:17:46.670 --> 01:17:47.671
Stop!

610
01:17:47.922 --> 01:17:49.640
Stop! I want to talk to you!

611
01:17:49.965 --> 01:17:51.033
A deal!

612
01:17:51.133 --> 01:17:53.744
I only make deals with honorable men!

613
01:18:01.810 --> 01:18:03.611
Whoa, Black.

614
01:18:11.070 --> 01:18:12.162
Let's go. Come on.

615
01:18:16.951 --> 01:18:17.998
Alec!

616
01:18:18.160 --> 01:18:19.603
Alec!

617
01:18:23.916 --> 01:18:24.963
Meslar!

618
01:18:25.209 --> 01:18:26.586
I thought you were dead.

619
01:19:02.955 --> 01:19:03.956
Alec!

620
01:19:05.082 --> 01:19:06.675
Alec, it's me!

621
01:19:08.002 --> 01:19:09.128
Are you all right, Alec?

622
01:19:09.795 --> 01:19:11.047
Yeah, I'm all right.

623
01:19:19.346 --> 01:19:20.438
The Uruk?

624
01:19:21.557 --> 01:19:22.774
I got away.

625
01:19:30.524 --> 01:19:31.884
I'm... I'm sorry, sir.

626
01:19:31.984 --> 01:19:33.201
I... I had to.

627
01:19:33.569 --> 01:19:36.909
My kingdom is in your hands.

628
01:19:37.489 --> 01:19:41.623
I appeal to you on behalf
of my people to help us...


629
01:19:41.869 --> 01:19:44.122
By riding your Black in the race.

630
01:19:45.497 --> 01:19:46.544
My Black?

631
01:19:46.749 --> 01:19:50.361
I see now that you
are the one rider for the horse.


632
01:19:50.461 --> 01:19:52.179
He has no other master.

633
01:19:52.755 --> 01:19:54.849
But if you want to keep him,
you must win the race.


634
01:19:55.382 --> 01:19:58.226
I pray he has the stamina.

635
01:20:49.686 --> 01:20:50.778
Shetan.

636
01:21:24.555 --> 01:21:25.556
Come.

637
01:21:46.326 --> 01:21:47.686
What's he talking about, Raj?

638
01:21:47.786 --> 01:21:49.413
I will tell you. 
I will tell you.

639
01:22:00.716 --> 01:22:02.218
Well, what was that all about, Raj?

640
01:22:02.634 --> 01:22:04.227
The landmarks for the race course.

641
01:22:04.511 --> 01:22:05.888
Is there gonna be flags or something?

642
01:22:07.139 --> 01:22:08.140
No.

643
01:22:08.474 --> 01:22:09.896
But you do not worry.

644
01:22:10.100 --> 01:22:11.352
You follow me.

645
01:22:11.810 --> 01:22:13.687
I will not mislead you, Alec Ramsey.

646
01:22:14.396 --> 01:22:15.397
I know.

647
01:22:16.815 --> 01:22:17.907
But I gotta win.

648
01:22:18.859 --> 01:22:19.860
So must I.

649
01:26:03.458 --> 01:26:05.005
- Argh!
- Hey!


650
01:27:06.229 --> 01:27:07.697
Whoa, Sagr, whoa!

651
01:27:19.451 --> 01:27:20.498
Alec!

652
01:27:20.869 --> 01:27:21.870
Alec!

653
01:27:22.496 --> 01:27:23.543
Here, Alec!

654
01:27:24.164 --> 01:27:25.211
Here!

655
01:27:27.667 --> 01:27:28.668
Raj.

656
01:27:29.419 --> 01:27:30.545
Choukran, Alec.

657
01:27:31.213 --> 01:27:32.280
The Uruk.

658
01:27:32.380 --> 01:27:33.448
The gray horse.

659
01:27:33.548 --> 01:27:35.221
The rider, he knocked me off.

660
01:27:35.509 --> 01:27:36.556
Yeah, me, too.

661
01:27:38.678 --> 01:27:40.100
No, no! This way is better.

662
01:27:40.722 --> 01:27:41.723
Follow!

663
01:28:55.797 --> 01:28:57.032
All right, Meslar!

664
01:28:57.132 --> 01:28:58.133
Meslar!

665
01:29:30.665 --> 01:29:32.383
It is just you and I now, Alec.

666
01:29:50.602 --> 01:29:51.694
Alec, look!

667
01:30:05.200 --> 01:30:07.147
Hold on to the wheel!

668
01:30:09.537 --> 01:30:10.538
It's not my fault.

669
01:30:13.375 --> 01:30:14.752
Shoot! Shoot!

670
01:30:15.293 --> 01:30:16.385
I'm blind!

671
01:30:16.711 --> 01:30:18.338
Shoot! Imbecile, shoot!

672
01:30:19.297 --> 01:30:20.344
Shoot!

673
01:31:02.298 --> 01:31:04.517
Come back! I want to talk to you!

674
01:31:04.843 --> 01:31:05.969
A deal!

675
01:31:07.595 --> 01:31:09.472
Son of a bitch!

676
01:32:34.641 --> 01:32:36.188
Shetan.

677
01:33:54.888 --> 01:33:56.890
You will always be
as a brother to me, Alec.


678
01:34:09.152 --> 01:34:10.153
Alec?

679
01:34:13.364 --> 01:34:14.957
He is my friend, sir.

680
01:34:20.747 --> 01:34:24.421
Your friend's horse is spared.

681
01:34:39.807 --> 01:34:42.230
Meslar! Meslar!

682
01:35:15.885 --> 01:35:17.979
No! No!

683
01:36:18.781 --> 01:36:20.704
Come on, come on, babies.

684
01:36:21.242 --> 01:36:22.368
Come on, babies.

685
01:36:24.537 --> 01:36:25.754
Come here. Come on.

686
01:36:26.914 --> 01:36:28.131
Come on, you little turkey.

687
01:36:28.416 --> 01:36:29.417
Come here.

688
01:36:30.043 --> 01:36:32.045
Oh, look at the nice little baby.

689
01:36:34.088 --> 01:36:35.260
Come on!

690
01:36:35.715 --> 01:36:36.967
Come on!

691
01:36:40.345 --> 01:36:41.517
Come here.

692
01:37:24.389 --> 01:37:27.817
How's my boy, huh? How are you?

693
01:38:21.946 --> 01:38:23.368
I think he belongs here.

694
01:38:31.038 --> 01:38:32.756
Maybe I'll be back.
