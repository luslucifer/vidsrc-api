1
00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:45.150
Climbing against the clock
is an unforgiving task.


2
00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.670
But I wanted to
show I could do something

3
00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:55.430
and prove I could do it
better than anyone else.


4
00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:02.310
A NETFLIX DOCUMENTARY

5
00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:06.750
<i>He climbs faster than anyone else.</i>

6
00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:09.230
<i>Usually alone
without any safety equipment.</i>


7
00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:12.230
<i>No ropes, no safety gear.</i>

8
00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:16.390
<i>As for his life insurance...</i>

9
00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.590
<i>the tips of his fingers and toes.</i>

10
00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:23.030
<i>Welcome, Ueli Steck!</i>

11
00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:28.630
Don't take this
the wrong way, but are you crazy?


12
00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:29.710
Sh!

13
00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:35.230
Ueli Steck, as one
of the world's fastest mountain climbers,


14
00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:36.390
someone is even faster now.

15
00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:37.270
Yes.

16
00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.030
Welcome, Dani Arnold.

17
00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:48.910
Ueli Steck was more
than a star. He was my role model.


18
00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:53.670
But I never imagined
that he'd also become my rival.


19
00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:01.510
<i>What is your next
goal? Just to become even faster?</i>


20
00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.430
<i>Dani Arnold, why do all this?</i>

21
00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:07.030
<i>Ueli Steck,
isn't this Russian roulette?</i>


22
00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:12.790
Once the games begin,
this duel between Arnold and Steck...


23
00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:17.270
It's only a matter of time
until the pressure is so great


24
00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:20.950
that if you make a mistake, then...

25
00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:24.550
it's over.

26
00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:32.750
RACE TO THE SUMMIT

27
00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:43.870
SWITZERLAND

28
00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:35.190
It may be difficult
for people to believe or understand,


29
00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:39.150
but I really am a scaredy-cat.

30
00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:58.150
Talking with insurance is
out of the question,


31
00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:00.750
so you can't afford to make any mistakes.

32
00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:03.910
You have to be able
to handle the pressure.


33
00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:11.630
You have to tell yourself, "I'm the best."

34
00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:13.830
And you have to believe it.

35
00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:30.430
All right. Ready to go.

36
00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:35.030
CALIFORNIA

37
00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:36.950
We'll start climbing,
then figure it out.


38
00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:38.350
Yeah, we'll sort it out.

39
00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:40.990
What is that shirt?
It's just all your random...


40
00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:42.350
What is "Richner" in there?

41
00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:44.230
- They make vacuums?
- Bathrooms.


42
00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:45.350
- Bathrooms?
- Yeah.


43
00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:47.110
- You're sponsored by a bathroom?
- Yeah.


44
00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:48.190
No shit.

45
00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:52.870
The first time meeting Ueli,
his English wasn't quite as good.


46
00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:57.150
I'm sure he must've had a sense of humor,
and I'm sure he must've had fun sometimes,


47
00:04:57.230 --> 00:04:59.750
but I never personally saw it,
I don't think.


48
00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:02.590
<i>He was very "on."</i>

49
00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:03.830
<i>Very Swiss.</i>

50
00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:07.190
I'm gonna run out
of rope in one second.

51
00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:15.630
Ueli and I teamed up to attempt

52
00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:17.710
the speed record
on "The Nose" of El Capitan


53
00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:20.510
which is a 900-meter wall
in Yosemite Valley.


54
00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:27.950
The appeal of speed climbing is
that it's so quantifiable.


55
00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:31.310
It's just an easy way to rank yourself
against other climbers.


56
00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:39.630
But normally, speed climbing
isn't actually that fast.


57
00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:42.870
Speed climbing normally
refers to very efficient climbing.


58
00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:44.670
When I climbed with Ueli
for the first time,


59
00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:47.206
I was like, "Oh, he actually puts
the speed in speed climbing."


60
00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:49.390
"Like, he's actually moving
really, really fast."


61
00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:58.070
Big wall climbing, hanging for days
at a time... I don't want to do that.


62
00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:02.310
For me, the adventure aspect of climbing

63
00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:05.630
has never really appealed to me.

64
00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:08.670
I'm more interested in the sports aspect.

65
00:06:09.630 --> 00:06:12.350
Exciting.
We already passed four on Freeblast.


66
00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:17.510
Oh, shit.

67
00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:23.990
You know, he was just more comfortable
being right on the limit


68
00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:25.550
than anybody I knew.

69
00:06:27.350 --> 00:06:29.190
I'm up a way, Ueli!

70
00:06:34.030 --> 00:06:36.030
Oh! Shit.

71
00:06:38.590 --> 00:06:42.030
He fell 25 meters, let's say.
Maybe a little more.


72
00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:45.350
He got some big scrapes, was bleeding
a bit. He was definitely banged up.


73
00:06:46.710 --> 00:06:48.790
I was like,
"Let's just come back tomorrow."


74
00:06:48.870 --> 00:06:51.470
"Let's... Let's go down,
have some ice cream, chill by the river."


75
00:06:51.550 --> 00:06:53.750
"Sort of relax. 
Like, enjoy the day."

76
00:06:53.830 --> 00:06:55.070
Let's keep going!

77
00:06:55.670 --> 00:06:57.150
Okay, keep going.

78
00:07:08.190 --> 00:07:09.230
Nice job!

79
00:07:09.750 --> 00:07:11.230
Pissed about myself.

80
00:07:11.310 --> 00:07:13.430
I fell off. That's an error.

81
00:07:13.950 --> 00:07:17.670
He definitely was annoyed with himself
and was like, "We keep going, no problem!"


82
00:07:17.750 --> 00:07:19.830
And I was like,
"Dude, this guy is psycho."


83
00:07:22.150 --> 00:07:25.190
Though I think now, in retrospect,
some of that is actually just


84
00:07:25.270 --> 00:07:27.310
his experience
as an alpinist at that point.


85
00:07:27.390 --> 00:07:31.070
And so I think he was just
much more comfortable with sketchy things.


86
00:07:44.590 --> 00:07:46.910
As a mountain climber,
there are all sorts of feats


87
00:07:46.990 --> 00:07:48.870
you're expected to accomplish.

88
00:07:48.950 --> 00:07:53.110
Free-climbing up El Capitan, for example,
or getting to the top of Everest.


89
00:07:53.190 --> 00:07:56.230
And then, of course,
you have the north face trilogy.


90
00:07:56.310 --> 00:07:57.710
SWITZERLAND
FRANCE - ITALY


91
00:07:59.270 --> 00:08:01.910
The Grandes Jorasses,
the Matterhorn, and the Eiger


92
00:08:01.990 --> 00:08:05.670
make up the three greatest challenges
of mountaineering in the Alps.


93
00:08:13.950 --> 00:08:16.670
It's more difficult
to climb the north face of a mountain.


94
00:08:18.030 --> 00:08:22.390
SWITZERLAND

95
00:08:23.830 --> 00:08:25.350
There's no sun, it gets cold,

96
00:08:25.430 --> 00:08:27.710
and it's usually steeper
than the south face.


97
00:08:29.230 --> 00:08:33.630
FRANCE

98
00:08:33.710 --> 00:08:36.510
They create
this mythological status.


99
00:08:38.190 --> 00:08:39.670
SWITZERLAND

100
00:08:39.750 --> 00:08:43.230
But for me, the north face
of the Eiger was always the focal point.


101
00:08:49.270 --> 00:08:51.390
It's a part of mountain climbing history.

102
00:08:54.350 --> 00:08:57.670
<i>The Eiger.
This name sends shivers of adventure</i>


103
00:08:57.750 --> 00:09:00.110
<i>down the spine of every non-alpinist too.</i>

104
00:09:02.910 --> 00:09:06.990
<i>In 1938, German alpinists
Heckmair and VÃ¶rg</i>


105
00:09:07.070 --> 00:09:10.390
<i>needed three days to climb
the 1,650-meter rock face.</i>


106
00:09:10.470 --> 00:09:14.590
<i>The Schlunegger brothers
were climbing for 38 hours.</i>


107
00:09:17.270 --> 00:09:20.590
How long
can you expect an ascent to take?


108
00:09:20.670 --> 00:09:26.590
I think that nowadays if an alpinist,
a young climber, is well-prepared


109
00:09:26.670 --> 00:09:30.310
with modern equipment
and knowledge about the face,


110
00:09:30.390 --> 00:09:33.710
it should be possible to climb
the face in a day.


111
00:09:34.350 --> 00:09:38.030
SWITZERLAND

112
00:09:42.830 --> 00:09:45.390
Well, I think it can be done
in under three hours.


113
00:09:46.710 --> 00:09:47.630
I had the idea,

114
00:09:47.710 --> 00:09:51.630
"Yes, I'd like to climb all three
great north faces in record time."


115
00:10:08.150 --> 00:10:11.230
Ueli has expressed interest
in climbing the north faces


116
00:10:11.310 --> 00:10:13.550
and doing it as a solo climb.

117
00:10:13.630 --> 00:10:16.070
He has the illusion of...
No, I mean the...


118
00:10:17.830 --> 00:10:20.830
You mean... You mean
he's someone with vision, right?


119
00:10:22.110 --> 00:10:25.190
To have that vision,
to be able to come up with the idea...


120
00:10:26.390 --> 00:10:28.670
That's the most fascinating thing.

121
00:10:29.190 --> 00:10:30.550
When I met Ueli...

122
00:10:30.630 --> 00:10:31.630
MOUNTAIN GUIDE

123
00:10:31.710 --> 00:10:35.390
...he was this young, energetic, hardcore
rock 'n' roller kinda guy. I mean,


124
00:10:37.190 --> 00:10:38.630
just motivated.

125
00:10:44.150 --> 00:10:45.190
He had this

126
00:10:45.270 --> 00:10:46.990
"Swiss machine" approach.

127
00:10:47.710 --> 00:10:51.790
It was a brutal, very athletic-focused
approach to training.


128
00:10:51.870 --> 00:10:53.430
He trained very hard.

129
00:10:56.150 --> 00:10:59.270
Even though the expectation was
to, you know, climb for a day,


130
00:10:59.350 --> 00:11:02.470
then rest a day,
then climb again the next day,


131
00:11:05.830 --> 00:11:08.110
Ueli climbed for five days straight.

132
00:11:12.390 --> 00:11:15.150
I don't consider myself to be
naturally talented in any way.


133
00:11:15.230 --> 00:11:16.790
Quite the contrary, in fact.

134
00:11:17.870 --> 00:11:19.950
I just prepare very meticulously.

135
00:11:20.030 --> 00:11:22.310
I'm very traditionally Swiss in that way.

136
00:11:27.030 --> 00:11:31.270
Ultimately, if I have a goal,
then I prepare for it. I pursue it.


137
00:11:45.750 --> 00:11:46.590
After a while,

138
00:11:46.670 --> 00:11:50.070
I began to consider the possibility
of free-climbing these routes.


139
00:11:51.390 --> 00:11:52.310
How you could move

140
00:11:52.390 --> 00:11:55.830
without pulling yourself up on hooks
or jumping on fixed ropes?


141
00:11:58.070 --> 00:12:01.950
And then I decided to climb it as fast as
I could and hopefully set a new record.


142
00:12:03.910 --> 00:12:06.190
Yes, I have him on the display now.

143
00:12:06.270 --> 00:12:08.550
You can fly in
above him now. That's it.

144
00:12:08.630 --> 00:12:09.630
Okay, great.

145
00:12:42.310 --> 00:12:44.950
If you think
of the... the classic depiction


146
00:12:45.030 --> 00:12:46.830
of a... of a Swiss alpinist

147
00:12:46.910 --> 00:12:50.830
as like the, whatever,
the high sock things and, like, yodeling,


148
00:12:51.470 --> 00:12:54.950
and then you contrast that against,
like, Ueli Steck's version of alpinism,


149
00:12:55.030 --> 00:12:58.310
where he's literally running up the face
as fast as anyone's ever moved.


150
00:12:58.390 --> 00:13:01.350
I mean, he really brought
the modern style to alpinism.


151
00:13:24.110 --> 00:13:27.270
The most difficult section is
the Hinterstoisser Traverse.


152
00:13:30.110 --> 00:13:31.030
HINTERSTOISSER TRAVERSE

153
00:13:31.110 --> 00:13:33.910
It's a smooth rock face, so there's
very little structure to work with.


154
00:13:37.230 --> 00:13:41.430
Now there's a fixed rope for climbers
so they can continue with greater ease.


155
00:13:44.350 --> 00:13:47.630
For me, the aim was
to climb the whole way without ropes.


156
00:13:56.750 --> 00:13:59.590
And then, when you look down
at that thousand-meter drop,


157
00:13:59.670 --> 00:14:02.310
you're struck with reality.
"If I fall here, I'm dead."


158
00:14:24.390 --> 00:14:26.750
Great.
That's fine. Stay on him.


159
00:14:27.830 --> 00:14:29.270
Stay on him.

160
00:14:54.110 --> 00:14:56.790
And then, when you stop
to get a bit of oxygen,


161
00:14:59.910 --> 00:15:02.150
you need a moment
to take it all in,

162
00:15:02.230 --> 00:15:04.630
realizing that you've
just reached the summit.


163
00:15:11.870 --> 00:15:13.830
But it's not until you look down
at your watch


164
00:15:13.910 --> 00:15:16.350
that you realize
how fast you've been climbing.


165
00:15:23.990 --> 00:15:26.670
<i>The idea that
a solo climber could ever conquer</i>


166
00:15:26.750 --> 00:15:28.430
<i>the notorious "death face" in record time</i>

167
00:15:28.510 --> 00:15:31.670
<i>is something nobody could've
dreamed of in the 1930s.</i>


168
00:15:32.270 --> 00:15:35.070
<i>Steck climbs the north face
of the Eiger in record time,</i>


169
00:15:35.150 --> 00:15:37.270
<i>two hours and 47 minutes.</i>

170
00:15:37.870 --> 00:15:41.190
<i>Well-known photographer and alpinist
RÃ¶bi BÃ¶sch got it all on tape.</i>


171
00:15:43.190 --> 00:15:45.950
<i>RÃ¶bi,
anything else you need me to do</i>


172
00:15:46.030 --> 00:15:47.750
<i>or would be good to have?</i>

173
00:15:47.830 --> 00:15:49.150
<i>Hold my arms up?</i>

174
00:15:49.230 --> 00:15:50.670
<i>Yeah, yeah.</i>

175
00:15:50.750 --> 00:15:54.190
<i>Not quite.
Up to that triangle where he's standing.</i>


176
00:15:55.910 --> 00:15:58.190
Goddammit. Maybe you can catch it?

177
00:16:00.710 --> 00:16:03.830
- Today you're a bit...
- I've lost quite a lot today!


178
00:16:03.910 --> 00:16:06.030
Everything's falling down here.

179
00:16:08.630 --> 00:16:10.590
I was
a very experienced photographer,


180
00:16:10.670 --> 00:16:12.390
and he was an exceptional mountaineer.

181
00:16:13.310 --> 00:16:16.030
Our combination of skills
just worked very well.


182
00:16:16.110 --> 00:16:17.590
A little bit higher.

183
00:16:20.390 --> 00:16:21.990
THE FASTEST MAN ON THE MOUNTAIN

184
00:16:22.070 --> 00:16:23.390
I guess you could say

185
00:16:23.470 --> 00:16:25.710
it was both
a mountaineering and media phenomenon.


186
00:16:26.230 --> 00:16:30.190
Ueli realized that himself
and believed it could sell really well.


187
00:16:32.070 --> 00:16:35.870
And so he tried to make a living from it,
a good living. That was Ueli.


188
00:16:35.950 --> 00:16:37.670
Welcome, Ueli Steck!

189
00:16:40.310 --> 00:16:43.030
Don't take it
the wrong way, but are you crazy?


190
00:16:43.630 --> 00:16:46.110
I've been asked that many times.

191
00:16:47.510 --> 00:16:50.670
Ueli Steck,
we normally walk to these chairs,


192
00:16:50.750 --> 00:16:52.990
but we thought you're used to climbing.

193
00:16:53.710 --> 00:16:54.710
He did this

194
00:16:54.750 --> 00:16:57.710
with that same single-minded focus
he had as a mountain climber.


195
00:16:58.310 --> 00:17:00.870
When I was young,
I played ice hockey.


196
00:17:00.950 --> 00:17:03.550
I've always been an athlete.

197
00:17:06.390 --> 00:17:09.390
It's nearly impossible to explain
the complexities of mountain climbing


198
00:17:09.470 --> 00:17:10.790
to the average person.

199
00:17:10.870 --> 00:17:13.950
But everyone can understand
time and speed.


200
00:17:14.030 --> 00:17:16.110
Ueli made the most of that too.

201
00:17:16.190 --> 00:17:20.230
Better to
run up mountains for ten years


202
00:17:20.310 --> 00:17:21.670
than sit around for 100?

203
00:17:23.590 --> 00:17:25.670
To him,
the next step was obvious.


204
00:17:25.750 --> 00:17:28.710
"Let's try to do it
on the Matterhorn and Grandes Jorasses."


205
00:17:36.830 --> 00:17:39.230
<i>The star of modern alpinism...</i>

206
00:17:39.310 --> 00:17:41.310
<i>Extreme alpinist, 
Ueli Steck.</i>

207
00:17:41.390 --> 00:17:44.310
<i>Extreme sportsman Ueli Steck
does these crazy things.</i>


208
00:17:44.390 --> 00:17:46.870
You have a girlfriend
and good life insurance?


209
00:17:46.950 --> 00:17:50.550
I can't get life insurance.
Not with the risks I'm taking.


210
00:17:50.630 --> 00:17:52.510
Does your girlfriend come with you?

211
00:17:52.590 --> 00:17:55.150
- Quite often.
- But she has a rope?


212
00:17:55.230 --> 00:17:56.390
- Always.
- Okay.


213
00:17:56.470 --> 00:17:59.470
Otherwise, I wouldn't allow that.
It'd be way too dangerous!


214
00:18:01.430 --> 00:18:04.390
<i>And now this Swiss alpinist's achievement,</i>

215
00:18:04.470 --> 00:18:09.630
<i>climbing the north face of the Matterhorn
in just an hour and 56 minutes.</i>


216
00:18:09.710 --> 00:18:13.510
<i>It's the third record set by Ueli Steck.</i>

217
00:18:13.590 --> 00:18:16.190
<i>Ueli Steck has made
his dream come true.</i>


218
00:18:16.270 --> 00:18:19.270
<i>He climbed
the three most famous Swiss north faces</i>


219
00:18:19.350 --> 00:18:20.590
<i>in record time.</i>

220
00:18:20.670 --> 00:18:22.390
<i>Solo and without ropes.</i>

221
00:18:24.470 --> 00:18:25.470
It's a sprint.

222
00:18:26.070 --> 00:18:27.830
- A sprint...
- A sprint to the top.


223
00:18:27.910 --> 00:18:31.110
What is your next goal?
Just to be even faster?


224
00:18:31.190 --> 00:18:34.750
I think you have to be careful
when going faster and faster.


225
00:18:34.830 --> 00:18:37.190
At some point, it gets really dangerous.

226
00:18:37.270 --> 00:18:40.030
If it's technically demanding,

227
00:18:40.110 --> 00:18:43.030
you need to be at a certain level

228
00:18:43.110 --> 00:18:46.070
and have certain skills
if you don't want to fall.


229
00:18:48.030 --> 00:18:50.510
I was fascinated
by his approach to climbing.


230
00:18:50.590 --> 00:18:52.990
It impressed me. 
He was already this hero.

231
00:18:56.190 --> 00:18:59.310
I admired the way he could
make a living from mountaineering.


232
00:19:01.670 --> 00:19:04.510
At the time, I was building machine parts.

233
00:19:05.670 --> 00:19:08.310
And in my off time,
I trained as a mountain guide.


234
00:19:12.790 --> 00:19:14.310
But I never imagined

235
00:19:14.390 --> 00:19:18.070
that I'd end up becoming
one of the best mountaineers in the world.


236
00:19:21.070 --> 00:19:24.070
Whatever
Ueli Steck does, he does it right.


237
00:19:24.150 --> 00:19:26.750
Yesterday, the extreme alpinist
introduced his new book


238
00:19:26.830 --> 00:19:30.790
about his record-breaking climbs
of the three great alpine north faces.


239
00:19:33.430 --> 00:19:36.790
The book is based
on interviews that I did with Ueli.


240
00:19:39.710 --> 00:19:42.070
When friends of mine
heard about it, it was like,


241
00:19:42.150 --> 00:19:44.110
"What? You're working with Ueli Steck?"

242
00:19:44.190 --> 00:19:46.390
For them, you know, 
Ueli Steck was just...

243
00:19:46.470 --> 00:19:47.470
BOOK AUTHOR

244
00:19:50.270 --> 00:19:53.590
<i>Ueli very heavily publicized
the speed records.</i>


245
00:19:54.710 --> 00:19:57.590
<i>But speed always involves
some sort of competition.</i>


246
00:19:58.510 --> 00:20:01.710
People ask me,
"Why did you climb the Eiger North Face,


247
00:20:01.790 --> 00:20:04.110
which people usually take two days..."

248
00:20:04.190 --> 00:20:08.830
"Why did you climb that in... three hours,
more or less?"


249
00:20:10.190 --> 00:20:12.470
A lot of people think it's just adventure,

250
00:20:12.550 --> 00:20:17.910
but I think mountaineering,
you really can change it when you're fit,


251
00:20:17.990 --> 00:20:19.550
when you take it as a sport.

252
00:20:19.630 --> 00:20:24.030
And that's how my approach went
for climbing all these mountains.


253
00:20:24.110 --> 00:20:27.110
And I think that's
how I found new challenges.


254
00:20:29.830 --> 00:20:31.830
I went to his presentations.

255
00:20:33.470 --> 00:20:35.630
Ueli Steck was the
big name at the time.

256
00:20:38.230 --> 00:20:41.870
"Is it possible?"
"Could I do it too?" I wanted to try.


257
00:20:46.550 --> 00:20:50.470
We live in a society
overrun with rules and regulations.


258
00:20:53.910 --> 00:20:58.710
But the ability to do what I want,
when I want, and the way I want to do it,


259
00:21:00.110 --> 00:21:03.350
I want that freedom,
and you can get that in the mountains.


260
00:21:06.790 --> 00:21:09.830
I found Dani to be
a very accomplished mountain guide.


261
00:21:11.670 --> 00:21:14.870
In 2010, I went
up Mont Blanc with him.

262
00:21:17.390 --> 00:21:19.150
I could see he was fast.

263
00:21:23.350 --> 00:21:26.790
There's a famous climbing ridge
in the Alps, the Salbit-Westgrat.


264
00:21:28.430 --> 00:21:32.110
He had climbed it beforehand
and had done so incredibly quickly.


265
00:21:34.230 --> 00:21:36.830
Most climbs take about ten hours.

266
00:21:38.430 --> 00:21:41.910
But I think I was able to climb it
in one hour and 35 minutes.


267
00:21:51.430 --> 00:21:53.110
Of course, the problem was

268
00:21:53.190 --> 00:21:56.310
that I couldn't tell my parents
I was going alone because,


269
00:21:56.830 --> 00:21:58.510
well, they would've locked me in.

270
00:21:58.590 --> 00:22:00.350
There was no way I could tell them.

271
00:22:03.670 --> 00:22:06.670
And then he told us he was at the top
and that everything went fine.


272
00:22:06.750 --> 00:22:07.750
DANI'S FATHER

273
00:22:08.310 --> 00:22:10.230
Yes, it's very difficult to see.

274
00:22:10.310 --> 00:22:11.750
I mean, when I see it, I...

275
00:22:11.830 --> 00:22:13.230
No, no.

276
00:22:14.630 --> 00:22:18.750
One brief lapse, a stone,
and it's over. Finito, right?


277
00:22:19.790 --> 00:22:21.390
But at the same time,

278
00:22:21.470 --> 00:22:25.630
I feel that it's very important
to stand by your beliefs and convictions.


279
00:22:27.390 --> 00:22:29.790
Otherwise, you know, you're just...

280
00:22:30.670 --> 00:22:31.950
You're not free.

281
00:22:32.870 --> 00:22:35.070
A mother's heart burns a little, right?

282
00:22:35.150 --> 00:22:36.670
DANI'S MOTHER

283
00:22:36.750 --> 00:22:39.470
But somehow, you just have to<i>...</i>

284
00:22:40.230 --> 00:22:42.590
You just have to let him do it.

285
00:22:44.750 --> 00:22:49.270
And it's his world and his life,
and he can do what he wants with it.


286
00:22:59.990 --> 00:23:03.670
Eventually, my thoughts turned
towards the north face of the Eiger.


287
00:23:05.830 --> 00:23:08.390
I knew Ueli Steck. 
I knew what he did.

288
00:23:08.910 --> 00:23:11.030
UELI THE SUMMIT RACER

289
00:23:11.110 --> 00:23:13.750
It was incredibly fast.
Dangerous, of course.


290
00:23:13.830 --> 00:23:16.950
But more than anything,
the fact that he was free-soloing.


291
00:23:21.030 --> 00:23:23.230
I just wanted to try it for myself.

292
00:23:31.790 --> 00:23:35.910
And when I took that first step
and moved into this vertical world,


293
00:23:36.950 --> 00:23:38.750
something kind of clicked.

294
00:23:54.510 --> 00:23:56.670
I was climbing the Eiger with a visitor.

295
00:24:00.990 --> 00:24:03.670
And I looked down,
and I saw someone far below us,


296
00:24:03.750 --> 00:24:06.270
someone moving incredibly fast.

297
00:24:08.790 --> 00:24:10.430
And then I realized it was Dani.

298
00:24:11.390 --> 00:24:12.390
Yeah.

299
00:24:16.510 --> 00:24:18.870
Dani was not a complete unknown.

300
00:24:20.790 --> 00:24:22.870
But he did keep a low profile.

301
00:24:42.830 --> 00:24:45.230
It was nice to be
able to see that live.

302
00:24:45.910 --> 00:24:48.030
The dawning of the next generation.

303
00:24:58.230 --> 00:25:00.750
I couldn't believe it
when I got to the summit.


304
00:25:02.110 --> 00:25:06.230
I don't know how many times I calculated
how long it had taken me to get there.


305
00:25:06.310 --> 00:25:09.950
NORTH FACE OF THE EIGER
NEW RECORD


306
00:25:10.030 --> 00:25:12.390
Twenty minutes faster
than Ueli Steck.


307
00:25:22.550 --> 00:25:23.750
I'm exhausted!

308
00:25:31.950 --> 00:25:34.830
Yes, you've now broken
the record that Ueli Steck set


309
00:25:34.910 --> 00:25:36.350
not that long ago.

310
00:25:39.790 --> 00:25:43.230
I thought it was only fair
to let Ueli know personally.


311
00:25:43.910 --> 00:25:44.910
Um...

312
00:25:45.990 --> 00:25:49.070
I sent him a text because I know
he's climbing in the Himalayas.


313
00:25:50.990 --> 00:25:53.350
You think he'll respond?

314
00:25:58.550 --> 00:25:59.710
He texted back.

315
00:26:02.030 --> 00:26:03.430
"Congratulations."

316
00:26:05.270 --> 00:26:06.510
That's how it is.

317
00:26:07.310 --> 00:26:09.710
That's great.
He can prepare himself for it again.


318
00:26:09.790 --> 00:26:10.990
Yes, I think.

319
00:26:12.030 --> 00:26:16.070
It's important that there are
lots of equally capable mountaineers.


320
00:26:18.470 --> 00:26:20.710
It's nice up here, isn't it?

321
00:26:20.790 --> 00:26:21.830
Yes, perfect.

322
00:26:27.230 --> 00:26:30.590
Yesterday,
a young mountain guide from Uri


323
00:26:30.670 --> 00:26:34.310
achieved a new record climb
in an amazing two hours and 28 minutes.


324
00:26:34.390 --> 00:26:36.630
That was Daniel Arnold.

325
00:26:37.750 --> 00:26:43.150
He beat professional climber Ueli Steck's
record by a whole 19 minutes.


326
00:26:43.230 --> 00:26:47.750
Two hours and 28 minutes
up the north face to the summit.


327
00:26:47.830 --> 00:26:50.910
Daniel Arnold would like
to see anyone else do that!


328
00:26:51.710 --> 00:26:52.870
Really awesome!

329
00:26:54.430 --> 00:26:58.550
CANTON OF URI

330
00:27:01.350 --> 00:27:05.110
<i>The unknown
young alpinist has thus become a new star</i>


331
00:27:05.190 --> 00:27:07.550
<i>of the extreme mountaineering scene.</i>

332
00:27:09.350 --> 00:27:13.190
<i>Arnold lives
in an apartment building here in BÃ¼rglen.</i>


333
00:27:14.870 --> 00:27:17.510
<i>If need be,
he practices in his living room.</i>


334
00:27:17.590 --> 00:27:21.630
<i>It has a climbing fingerboard on the wall.
You can tell he climbs from his fingers...</i>


335
00:27:26.950 --> 00:27:30.230
He climbed over
the roof when he was three or four.


336
00:27:30.310 --> 00:27:32.430
Our three-story house.

337
00:27:33.670 --> 00:27:37.390
"Hello, Mommy!" Of course,
I was having coffee down on the terrace.


338
00:27:37.470 --> 00:27:40.150
And then I looked up.
"Oh my God!"


339
00:27:42.230 --> 00:27:45.790
Then I just said,
"Please come back down, nice and slowly."


340
00:27:48.350 --> 00:27:50.470
It was easy for him, 
I have to say.

341
00:27:54.510 --> 00:27:57.870
I mean, don't forget,
it's over 1,700 meters.


342
00:27:58.870 --> 00:28:00.910
The weather wasn't always good either.

343
00:28:02.830 --> 00:28:04.990
I get the feeling
it's just good for children


344
00:28:05.070 --> 00:28:08.390
because you have to struggle
through it, too, and that leaves its mark.


345
00:28:10.790 --> 00:28:13.030
It shapes you, makes you tough.

346
00:28:21.190 --> 00:28:23.750
Right. Well, right now,
we're just taking some pictures.


347
00:28:23.830 --> 00:28:24.870
This is Thomas.

348
00:28:27.830 --> 00:28:30.990
I met Dani at the beginnings
of his mountain climbing career.


349
00:28:31.510 --> 00:28:33.750
He was up and running really quickly, but...

350
00:28:34.110 --> 00:28:35.390
PHOTOGRAPHER AND MOUNTAIN GUIDE

351
00:28:35.470 --> 00:28:37.990
...he felt as though
he wasn't a strong mountaineer at all.


352
00:28:41.070 --> 00:28:42.350
I'm sure it was difficult

353
00:28:42.430 --> 00:28:44.830
for him to recognize
that he wasn't just good,


354
00:28:45.350 --> 00:28:46.550
he was world-class.

355
00:28:51.510 --> 00:28:54.510
At that time, I was looking
for different opportunities


356
00:28:54.590 --> 00:28:56.670
and climbing projects all over the world.

357
00:28:58.070 --> 00:29:00.350
But I was looking for
my own path as well.

358
00:29:05.270 --> 00:29:08.030
The fact that
such a big, strong man


359
00:29:08.110 --> 00:29:10.310
can move so delicately
over the ice and rock,


360
00:29:10.390 --> 00:29:11.870
it never ceases to amaze me.

361
00:29:13.230 --> 00:29:16.310
Without a doubt,
he is as strong as Ueli Steck.


362
00:29:21.190 --> 00:29:22.670
I also find it fascinating

363
00:29:22.750 --> 00:29:26.270
that Dani and Ueli
are each other's complete opposite.


364
00:29:28.110 --> 00:29:32.430
On the one hand, you have Ueli Steck.
Extremely focused and well-organized.


365
00:29:34.590 --> 00:29:37.350
He had a strict training plan,
a nutritionist,


366
00:29:37.430 --> 00:29:38.950
an entire team behind him.

367
00:29:42.350 --> 00:29:44.350
And on the other hand, you have Dani,

368
00:29:44.430 --> 00:29:48.510
who eats sausages in the evening
and sets a speed record the next day.


369
00:29:50.870 --> 00:29:53.390
Dani, did you get yourself
a new nutritionist?


370
00:29:54.230 --> 00:29:55.510
Yeah, it's not so bad.

371
00:30:03.110 --> 00:30:05.510
Ueli was not
born into a mountaineering family.


372
00:30:06.630 --> 00:30:09.350
He grew up in Emmental,
which is fairly flat.


373
00:30:09.870 --> 00:30:11.310
Ueli was ambitious.

374
00:30:12.350 --> 00:30:15.030
His ambition was probably
his most definitive character trait.


375
00:30:20.270 --> 00:30:22.430
From a purely physical
point of view,


376
00:30:22.510 --> 00:30:24.590
I'm not a natural-born athlete.

377
00:30:25.710 --> 00:30:28.550
To reach that level,
I need to work hard at everything.


378
00:30:34.670 --> 00:30:38.510
I tend to live in the moment,
but sometimes I do envy him.


379
00:30:38.590 --> 00:30:40.590
I especially envy his willpower.

380
00:30:42.990 --> 00:30:45.710
Ueli Steck was more than a star.
He was my role model.


381
00:30:48.790 --> 00:30:52.830
But I never imagined
that he'd also become my rival.


382
00:30:54.790 --> 00:30:59.110
TWO MONTHS AFTER DANI'
S EIGER RECORD

383
00:31:04.910 --> 00:31:06.910
One day, quite unexpectedly,

384
00:31:06.990 --> 00:31:10.430
I saw an article
published in a major Swiss newspaper.


385
00:31:12.390 --> 00:31:14.150
UELI STECK IS RELAXING?
YES, I'M ENJOYING IT.


386
00:31:14.230 --> 00:31:17.150
There was a great deal of criticism
from Ueli Steck.


387
00:31:17.230 --> 00:31:20.630
...DANIEL ARNOLD BEAT YOUR RECORD
BY 20 MINUTES...


388
00:31:20.710 --> 00:31:22.790
...CLIMBING WITHOUT ROPES...

389
00:31:22.870 --> 00:31:25.110
Ueli said that I had cheated...

390
00:31:25.190 --> 00:31:26.470
...NOT COMPARABLE

391
00:31:26.550 --> 00:31:29.350
...all because I had used rope
during my free-climb.


392
00:31:29.430 --> 00:31:31.030
HINTERSTOISSER
TRAVERSE


393
00:31:31.110 --> 00:31:33.910
Specifically,
the Hinterstoisser Traverse rope.


394
00:31:40.830 --> 00:31:44.430
So I reached out to him
and asked if we could meet for coffee.


395
00:31:47.190 --> 00:31:49.590
I really had to be careful
on the Hinterstoisser.


396
00:31:49.670 --> 00:31:51.550
It was a very controlled climb.

397
00:31:53.110 --> 00:31:54.710
I had to stand quite flat.

398
00:31:54.790 --> 00:31:58.630
And when you consider the crampons
were pushed against a smooth rock face


399
00:31:58.710 --> 00:32:02.350
and how thin your climbing hooks are,
the time begins to add up.


400
00:32:03.830 --> 00:32:05.390
It's not like a 100-meter race.

401
00:32:05.470 --> 00:32:08.030
You're not directly
competing against each other.


402
00:32:11.470 --> 00:32:14.750
Of course, he's right.
It's not a 100-meter race.


403
00:32:16.190 --> 00:32:18.430
But when you publicly fire off criticism,

404
00:32:18.510 --> 00:32:21.350
the media will pick it up
almost immediately,


405
00:32:21.430 --> 00:32:25.230
and I think that's a very unpleasant way
of handling things like this.


406
00:32:28.790 --> 00:32:32.590
I free-climbed the whole face.
He pulled the ropes.


407
00:32:33.110 --> 00:32:38.430
I'm proud about that. I was the first
who really pushed it to that limit.


408
00:32:38.950 --> 00:32:41.870
Climbing without the rope is just pure.

409
00:32:42.630 --> 00:32:44.470
You cannot cheat anything, you know?

410
00:32:44.550 --> 00:32:47.790
It's just you and the rock,
or just you and the mountain.


411
00:32:50.350 --> 00:32:53.030
I think that, at the time,
Ueli was surprised.


412
00:32:53.110 --> 00:32:55.270
He probably never imagined
someone like Dani


413
00:32:55.350 --> 00:32:56.670
would come along so soon.

414
00:33:00.470 --> 00:33:03.990
But free-climbing
the Hinterstoisser Traverse is crazy.


415
00:33:04.870 --> 00:33:07.630
It's incredibly risky.
You could easily die.


416
00:33:10.830 --> 00:33:14.430
Honestly, I've used the rope
every time I've climbed the Eiger.


417
00:33:16.350 --> 00:33:19.470
Dani Arnold, others train for months.

418
00:33:19.550 --> 00:33:22.110
How was the north face
of the Eiger for you?


419
00:33:22.710 --> 00:33:24.070
Well, I...

420
00:33:24.750 --> 00:33:28.790
I must say,
I didn't train very hard for it.


421
00:33:29.430 --> 00:33:32.070
I'm a mountain guide. 
I've climbed a lot.

422
00:33:34.990 --> 00:33:38.310
That said, when you compare him
to everyone else in the world,


423
00:33:38.390 --> 00:33:40.510
I actually think Ueli was, in fact,

424
00:33:40.590 --> 00:33:43.710
the most qualified
to judge Dani's achievement.


425
00:33:45.270 --> 00:33:47.550
Some are now claiming you cheated.

426
00:33:51.150 --> 00:33:54.030
<i>Looking back,
I was just very naive and starry-eyed.</i>


427
00:33:55.710 --> 00:34:00.710
<i>But receiving that kind of criticism
and being criticized in such a public way,</i>


428
00:34:01.950 --> 00:34:02.950
<i>that hurt me.</i>

429
00:34:04.070 --> 00:34:06.950
But don't risk
your life for the next record.


430
00:34:07.030 --> 00:34:08.870
There's no point.

431
00:34:08.950 --> 00:34:11.790
As a mountain guide,
you enjoy being in the mountains.


432
00:34:11.870 --> 00:34:14.950
- It's not about new records.
- That's right.


433
00:34:17.550 --> 00:34:20.910
<i>It's not a sort of
small minority in the canton of Uri.</i>


434
00:34:20.990 --> 00:34:22.950
<i>It's ZÃ¼rich. 
It's Switzerland.</i>

435
00:34:23.030 --> 00:34:24.550
<i>This is big, isn't it?</i>

436
00:34:29.430 --> 00:34:30.590
Ueli Steck,

437
00:34:30.670 --> 00:34:33.350
you once said
the best alpinist isn't the most famous,


438
00:34:33.430 --> 00:34:35.470
it's the one with the best marketing.

439
00:34:35.550 --> 00:34:39.590
Yes, you can't make a living
just by being a good alpinist.


440
00:34:39.670 --> 00:34:43.430
Nobody is interested.
You have to be able to communicate it.


441
00:34:43.510 --> 00:34:47.030
So now you have to come up
with new marketing ideas


442
00:34:47.110 --> 00:34:49.190
to keep the excitement up

443
00:34:49.270 --> 00:34:53.470
because you probably can't climb
the north face of the Eiger any faster?


444
00:34:53.550 --> 00:34:57.750
No, I won't go back up the north face
of the Eiger to try to go even faster.


445
00:34:57.830 --> 00:35:01.110
That would be like treading water.
No point in that.


446
00:35:01.190 --> 00:35:04.590
It's important
to keep moving forward in life.


447
00:35:09.950 --> 00:35:11.830
People need
huge challenges.


448
00:35:11.910 --> 00:35:15.470
They need adventure in their lives.
Without it, you might as well be dead.


449
00:35:18.070 --> 00:35:21.390
So what are we doing now?
What's the new goal?


450
00:35:25.270 --> 00:35:28.710
I want to try and take
what I achieved on the north faces


451
00:35:28.790 --> 00:35:30.150
a step further.

452
00:35:30.230 --> 00:35:33.950
And for me, I want to try
and take that next step in the Himalayas.


453
00:35:36.350 --> 00:35:38.510
I hope to break new boundaries there.

454
00:35:39.110 --> 00:35:42.110
The key to success is simply speed.

455
00:35:55.710 --> 00:35:57.950
Considering his knowledge,
his speed,


456
00:35:58.030 --> 00:35:59.710
and his efficiency as a climber,

457
00:36:00.310 --> 00:36:03.230
Ueli decided to go and tackle
the really big mountains,


458
00:36:03.310 --> 00:36:05.750
so he went searching in the Himalayas.

459
00:36:07.470 --> 00:36:10.510
He trekked to Annapurna
to look at its south face.


460
00:36:12.950 --> 00:36:16.830
And when he saw it, he realized,
"This could be a new project for me."


461
00:36:17.590 --> 00:36:21.230
It's the most dangerous eight-thousander.
Its avalanches are deadly.


462
00:36:21.830 --> 00:36:25.990
ANNAPURNA
SOUTH FACE


463
00:36:26.470 --> 00:36:28.510
- Uh-huh. The middle one.
- The middle one.


464
00:36:28.590 --> 00:36:30.270
Just to the left...

465
00:36:31.230 --> 00:36:32.750
The big challenges are

466
00:36:32.830 --> 00:36:35.710
no longer trying to be a minute faster
climbing the Eiger.


467
00:36:36.470 --> 00:36:38.710
The big challenges
are now in the Himalayas.


468
00:36:52.270 --> 00:36:54.310
- This one has snapped.
- Oh, yeah.


469
00:36:55.190 --> 00:36:59.070
If that's the smallest problem
we have on this climb, I'm psyched.


470
00:37:00.870 --> 00:37:03.510
He had objectives planned out
years ahead,


471
00:37:03.590 --> 00:37:05.790
and he had his partners planned out
years ahead.


472
00:37:05.870 --> 00:37:07.750
Even if it was
in my wheelhouse, he would say...


473
00:37:07.830 --> 00:37:09.110
HIGH ALTITUDE MOUNTAINEER

474
00:37:09.190 --> 00:37:11.910
"No, Don, you're not my partner
on that one. Wait till the next one."


475
00:37:13.870 --> 00:37:15.830
You only have
so much to work with here, so...


476
00:37:15.910 --> 00:37:18.870
Yeah. I mean,
for us, it's good so we have something...


477
00:37:21.950 --> 00:37:23.310
You know, we had fun.

478
00:37:23.390 --> 00:37:28.230
At 7,000 meters, we'd sing that song
from Survivor, "The Eye of the Tiger."


479
00:37:34.110 --> 00:37:38.350
You know, they call me
the "Eiger Tiger" in... in England?


480
00:37:38.430 --> 00:37:39.630
- Really?
- Yeah!


481
00:37:39.710 --> 00:37:41.270
The "Eiger Tiger."

482
00:37:48.190 --> 00:37:52.110
When we were sitting up there joking
and singing the "Eiger Tiger" to Survivor,


483
00:37:52.190 --> 00:37:54.110
it was incredibly dangerous.

484
00:37:56.270 --> 00:37:58.350
Just at the bottom of the face now.

485
00:37:58.430 --> 00:38:00.910
You can see it up above me.

486
00:38:01.590 --> 00:38:02.630
Beautiful clouds.

487
00:38:05.230 --> 00:38:09.190
One of the most terrifying things
about the south face of Annapurna


488
00:38:09.270 --> 00:38:10.350
is its rockfall.

489
00:38:14.950 --> 00:38:16.470
It was constant.

490
00:38:17.670 --> 00:38:19.870
We had a hole
or two in the tent

491
00:38:19.950 --> 00:38:23.270
where shards had broken through
as they smashed around us.


492
00:38:25.710 --> 00:38:28.350
And the reason
why we weren't gonna use rope


493
00:38:28.430 --> 00:38:31.510
is because the likelihood
of one of us getting pegged


494
00:38:31.590 --> 00:38:34.230
was so high,
you'd just pull the other person off.


495
00:38:41.310 --> 00:38:44.070
At that time, it had
a one in three death-to-summit rate.


496
00:38:44.950 --> 00:38:48.310
For every three climbers
who make the summit, one dies trying.


497
00:38:53.550 --> 00:38:56.630
So, uh, Ueli and I have arrived now.

498
00:38:56.710 --> 00:38:57.910
Woo-hoo!

499
00:38:57.990 --> 00:38:59.230
We're on the face.

500
00:38:59.830 --> 00:39:05.190
- The slopes, uh, were unbelievably safe.
- Easy, easy. Yeah, yeah.


501
00:39:05.270 --> 00:39:07.950
- Easy. Yeah, yeah. No problem.
- Yeah, it's, uh...


502
00:39:09.550 --> 00:39:11.150
No, easy!

503
00:39:11.910 --> 00:39:13.030
We'll get up there.

504
00:39:14.670 --> 00:39:17.590
Ueli said,
"I think the conditions are better now,


505
00:39:17.670 --> 00:39:19.230
so I think we should go up."

506
00:39:33.670 --> 00:39:36.150
Anyway, it's no problem with the rock.

507
00:39:36.670 --> 00:39:37.950
The weather is okay.

508
00:39:41.030 --> 00:39:43.070
For me, the risk was too high.

509
00:39:43.150 --> 00:39:46.270
And I said, "No. I'm not going,"
and he continued up.


510
00:39:48.270 --> 00:39:52.190
- Do you see, like, little flags?
- Yeah, they're very pretty.


511
00:39:52.270 --> 00:39:55.030
They're really Swiss style, huh?

512
00:39:55.750 --> 00:39:58.710
Not that crap bamboo from Nepal.

513
00:40:01.950 --> 00:40:03.910
- See you, huh?
- Yeah.


514
00:40:05.350 --> 00:40:07.430
No worries. I'll keep you updated.

515
00:40:20.590 --> 00:40:21.590
Rolling.

516
00:40:22.350 --> 00:40:25.150
Whatever he decides to do today,

517
00:40:25.230 --> 00:40:27.990
whether he's just gonna go up
and sleep at 7,000 meters


518
00:40:28.070 --> 00:40:30.670
and get acclimatized more,
or he's gonna go for the summit,


519
00:40:30.750 --> 00:40:32.070
we're behind him 100%.

520
00:40:32.150 --> 00:40:36.750
We're just gonna wait here and just see
how the next day or two unfolds.


521
00:40:38.270 --> 00:40:40.590
And it appears that, uh...

522
00:40:40.670 --> 00:40:44.310
It appears that he's going for it.
He may even be going for the summit today.


523
00:40:48.790 --> 00:40:52.390
I mean, above 6,200 meters,
the body is dying.


524
00:40:53.150 --> 00:40:56.070
So speed is safety in the big mountains.

525
00:40:56.150 --> 00:40:57.830
There's no question about it.

526
00:41:07.990 --> 00:41:12.750
Dan Patitucci and I watched him continue
to ascend throughout the day.


527
00:41:16.750 --> 00:41:18.550
- That's a cool shot.
- Yeah.


528
00:41:18.630 --> 00:41:21.070
- With the avalanche next to him.
- Yeah.


529
00:41:22.550 --> 00:41:25.070
I mean,
he can't be thinking about going up?


530
00:41:26.110 --> 00:41:28.630
Who knows what's going
through that guy's head?


531
00:41:35.630 --> 00:41:38.750
And at that point,
these raging winds came


532
00:41:38.830 --> 00:41:40.830
and created spindrift on the face,

533
00:41:40.910 --> 00:41:43.750
which creates literally avalanches
all over the face.


534
00:41:45.670 --> 00:41:48.070
You'd see him actually disappear.

535
00:41:48.150 --> 00:41:50.030
His little dot would disappear.

536
00:41:50.550 --> 00:41:52.030
There was a lot of spindrift.

537
00:41:52.110 --> 00:41:52.950
PHOTOGRAPHER

538
00:41:53.030 --> 00:41:54.750
- Yeah.
- That thing was running nonstop.


539
00:41:54.830 --> 00:41:57.350
What do you think that means,
as far as what he'll do?


540
00:41:57.430 --> 00:41:59.230
I think he'll have
a look in the night,

541
00:42:00.270 --> 00:42:01.310
see if this thing...

542
00:42:01.390 --> 00:42:05.070
If the wind calms down and it's quiet,
he'll go up on the rock


543
00:42:05.150 --> 00:42:07.790
'cause he was talking
about going up in the dark, for sure.


544
00:42:11.030 --> 00:42:15.470
I knew he was serious when he said
he didn't bring his phone from base camp.


545
00:42:15.550 --> 00:42:18.030
- Yeah.
- He's like, "No, I'm all business."


546
00:42:18.110 --> 00:42:21.750
- Yeah. He did say that, didn't he?
- Not even the phone.


547
00:42:28.750 --> 00:42:31.630
Then night came.
I looked up on the face.


548
00:42:31.710 --> 00:42:33.990
The winds had stopped. 
The stars were out.

549
00:42:34.070 --> 00:42:36.470
And I looked really closely
through the lens.


550
00:42:36.550 --> 00:42:39.870
And I looked really closely to try to see
if I could see his light up there,


551
00:42:39.950 --> 00:42:41.430
and I... I couldn't see anything.

552
00:42:50.230 --> 00:42:51.590
What's going on, Dan?

553
00:42:52.270 --> 00:42:54.390
Bread, tea, trying to find Ueli.

554
00:42:55.030 --> 00:42:58.430
<i>In the morning,
woke up, and we're all looking for him.</i>


555
00:42:59.070 --> 00:43:01.910
<i>And then, there he was,
descending that snowfield again.</i>


556
00:43:03.310 --> 00:43:04.310
Oh, wait.

557
00:43:04.790 --> 00:43:06.350
He's right of that.

558
00:43:06.950 --> 00:43:09.390
Way right of that. 
He's up in here.

559
00:43:15.710 --> 00:43:18.590
<i>It took me a while
to wrap my head around</i>


560
00:43:18.670 --> 00:43:20.670
<i>that that's what happened in the night.</i>

561
00:43:22.270 --> 00:43:25.150
<i>You know? "Wait a minute. You summited?
I just saw you coming down."</i>


562
00:43:25.230 --> 00:43:29.230
<i>I... I just couldn't believe he summited.
It was just so fast.</i>


563
00:43:30.310 --> 00:43:31.830
It was unbelievable.

564
00:43:33.670 --> 00:43:35.590
- Well...
- Uh...


565
00:43:38.510 --> 00:43:41.070
- Thanks.
- Great job, man!


566
00:43:43.710 --> 00:43:45.830
Let's go to the beach now.

567
00:43:49.030 --> 00:43:51.870
Twenty-eight hours,
Annapurna South Face.


568
00:43:51.950 --> 00:43:55.830
A great day. A perfect success for me.

569
00:43:56.630 --> 00:43:57.990
And now I've climbed it.

570
00:44:00.070 --> 00:44:02.230
So the south face
of Annapurna has a Swiss route.


571
00:44:06.670 --> 00:44:09.670
Ueli Steck has
now achieved another sensation.


572
00:44:09.750 --> 00:44:13.590
He's the first to conquer
the eight-thousander Annapurna solo.


573
00:44:13.670 --> 00:44:16.750
Here is the picture
from his Facebook page.


574
00:44:16.830 --> 00:44:17.910
Awesome!

575
00:44:19.550 --> 00:44:22.710
BOUNDARY PUSHER FROM THE BERNESE ALPS

576
00:44:23.870 --> 00:44:26.270
Welcome
to the Piolets d'Or awards ceremony.


577
00:44:26.350 --> 00:44:28.150
This is alpinism's equivalent
of the Oscars,


578
00:44:28.230 --> 00:44:30.510
and the opening ceremony is
about to get underway.


579
00:44:31.350 --> 00:44:34.230
Famous climbers and the jury members
are about to arrive.


580
00:44:34.310 --> 00:44:37.630
There's free food, free booze. We'll talk
to as many famous people as we can...


581
00:44:37.710 --> 00:44:40.430
Each year, the Piolets d'Or showcases

582
00:44:40.510 --> 00:44:42.510
the alpinism's best from the last year.

583
00:44:42.590 --> 00:44:45.110
It's a bit like the Oscars of alpinism.

584
00:44:47.350 --> 00:44:50.590
The Piolets d'Or 2014 goes to Ueli Steck.

585
00:44:50.670 --> 00:44:53.630
For the first solo climb
of the Annapurna South Face.


586
00:44:56.790 --> 00:44:59.790
Ueli, congratulations. 
How does this feel?

587
00:44:59.870 --> 00:45:02.790
Yeah, I'm... I'm pretty happy. So psyched!

588
00:45:11.390 --> 00:45:15.470
For me, personally, Annapurna is
already the pinnacle achievement.


589
00:45:17.390 --> 00:45:20.670
It was a moment
I had dreamed about for years.


590
00:45:23.830 --> 00:45:27.390
But in hindsight,
it turned out to be a double-edged sword.


591
00:45:27.910 --> 00:45:30.430
I had never taken
such a big risk in my life.


592
00:45:33.150 --> 00:45:35.310
When was the moment
where you realized


593
00:45:35.390 --> 00:45:37.350
that there was no going back?

594
00:45:38.830 --> 00:45:41.470
I had already planned
on having to climb during the night,


595
00:45:41.550 --> 00:45:43.230
so I made sure to bring my camera.

596
00:45:43.310 --> 00:45:45.350
The idea was
to take a picture with my camera


597
00:45:45.430 --> 00:45:46.910
to help guide me in the dark,

598
00:45:46.990 --> 00:45:49.430
so I pulled out my camera
and took a photo.


599
00:45:50.030 --> 00:45:53.270
And then I was about to take
a second photo when a spindrift,


600
00:45:53.350 --> 00:45:56.710
which is a wind-blown avalanche,
hit me full-on.


601
00:45:58.270 --> 00:46:02.550
That was an incredibly precarious moment.
I could've fallen right then and there.


602
00:46:02.630 --> 00:46:04.310
But for me, it was like...

603
00:46:06.390 --> 00:46:08.550
a switch in my head had been flicked.

604
00:46:08.630 --> 00:46:12.070
And from that moment on,
I accepted the risk and just pushed ahead.


605
00:46:16.110 --> 00:46:17.910
Switzerland is
the world champion


606
00:46:17.990 --> 00:46:19.550
when it comes to insurance.

607
00:46:20.070 --> 00:46:23.350
We wouldn't be
if we weren't so incredibly risk-averse.


608
00:46:23.870 --> 00:46:26.190
That's what was so wonderful about Ueli.

609
00:46:26.270 --> 00:46:28.550
On the one hand,
he was so typically Swiss...


610
00:46:28.630 --> 00:46:29.790
TV HOST

611
00:46:29.870 --> 00:46:34.030
...modest, normal, friendly.
Just a nice, reliable sort of person.


612
00:46:35.790 --> 00:46:38.190
And on the other hand, he was crazy.

613
00:46:41.590 --> 00:46:45.470
For me as a journalist,
it was an irresistible combination.


614
00:46:47.790 --> 00:46:50.190
What's it like,
living a lifestyle like yours?


615
00:46:51.390 --> 00:46:55.350
For example, is it compatible
with having a family, having children?


616
00:46:57.390 --> 00:47:00.350
Well, for me, the idea of having children...

617
00:47:01.350 --> 00:47:05.550
You know, mountaineering, expeditions,
all of it's dangerous and risky.


618
00:47:07.110 --> 00:47:08.590
And for me, I would...

619
00:47:08.670 --> 00:47:11.910
I'd find it difficult to deal with,
knowing I had a child at home.


620
00:47:11.990 --> 00:47:12.990
Hmm.

621
00:47:31.230 --> 00:47:32.230
DANI'S WIFE

622
00:47:32.310 --> 00:47:33.990
Dani and I grew
up in the same community.

623
00:47:36.750 --> 00:47:39.750
And then we agreed
to start climbing together.


624
00:47:41.550 --> 00:47:44.030
And eventually, we became a couple.

625
00:47:46.270 --> 00:47:48.470
We dreamed of starting a family

626
00:47:49.390 --> 00:47:51.310
for quite some time now.

627
00:47:59.190 --> 00:48:03.950
He was just this affable, athletic, this

628
00:48:04.990 --> 00:48:06.790
energetic young man.

629
00:48:11.990 --> 00:48:14.790
The speed ascent
of the north face of the Eiger


630
00:48:14.870 --> 00:48:17.550
was really the springboard for his career.

631
00:48:24.150 --> 00:48:27.630
But the media circuit that followed
completely threw him off-course.


632
00:48:29.470 --> 00:48:32.510
He wasn't prepared for it at all.
He didn't expect it.


633
00:48:34.590 --> 00:48:38.270
Ueli Steck, as one
of the best mountaineers in the world,


634
00:48:38.350 --> 00:48:41.630
how fast did you go up
the north face of the Eiger?


635
00:48:41.710 --> 00:48:43.390
Two hours, 47 minutes.

636
00:48:43.470 --> 00:48:47.070
- Since then, someone's been faster.
- Yes. Two hours, 29 minutes.


637
00:48:47.150 --> 00:48:51.870
But it's completely different.
It's a game that he's playing there.


638
00:48:52.430 --> 00:48:56.070
SPEED CLIMBING
DANGEROUS DUEL ON THE MOUNTAIN


639
00:49:00.190 --> 00:49:01.550
I never imagined

640
00:49:01.630 --> 00:49:03.910
there would be
as much media coverage as there was.


641
00:49:05.510 --> 00:49:08.350
I tried to avoid
it, and the rivalry too.

642
00:49:12.830 --> 00:49:15.670
But I wanted to be taken seriously
as a mountaineer.


643
00:49:15.750 --> 00:49:17.950
That's how I wanted people to see me.

644
00:49:20.790 --> 00:49:24.430
The north face of the Matterhorn...
Fastest time, Ueli Steck.


645
00:49:29.950 --> 00:49:33.950
NORTH FACE OF THE MATTERHORN
UELI'S RECORD


646
00:49:39.510 --> 00:49:40.790
But at the time,

647
00:49:40.870 --> 00:49:44.430
Ueli Steck didn't officially climb
the original north face route.


648
00:49:48.950 --> 00:49:50.710
I was set from the very beginning.

649
00:49:53.790 --> 00:49:55.790
I knew I wanted to use the routes

650
00:49:55.870 --> 00:49:58.590
that had been scaled
by the first climbers.


651
00:50:02.390 --> 00:50:05.510
And I was sure
they could be climbed even faster.


652
00:50:18.030 --> 00:50:21.590
This week,
another record fell on the Matterhorn,


653
00:50:21.670 --> 00:50:23.110
a speed record.

654
00:50:23.190 --> 00:50:26.670
Just in time for the 150th anniversary
of its first ascent.


655
00:50:26.750 --> 00:50:31.230
The Uri mountaineer Dani Arnold
conquered the most Swiss of all mountains


656
00:50:31.310 --> 00:50:33.910
faster than anyone has before.

657
00:50:35.630 --> 00:50:37.590
<i>The north face
of the Matterhorn.</i>


658
00:50:37.670 --> 00:50:40.870
<i>Normal alpinists
take eight to twelve hours</i>


659
00:50:40.950 --> 00:50:43.110
<i>to climb the over 1,000 vertical meters.</i>

660
00:50:43.870 --> 00:50:46.990
<i>It took Dani Arnold a lot less time
to reach the summit.</i>


661
00:50:47.070 --> 00:50:50.510
<i>One hour and 46 minutes, a new record.</i>

662
00:50:54.030 --> 00:50:57.350
When people see images
and videos of climbs like this,


663
00:50:57.430 --> 00:51:00.790
they assume that there's nothing enjoyable
in running up a mountain.


664
00:51:03.230 --> 00:51:04.630
But once you've done it yourself,

665
00:51:04.710 --> 00:51:07.870
you feel this enormous sense
of satisfaction and pleasure.


666
00:51:07.950 --> 00:51:12.110
It's incredible, and it motivates you
to push yourself and just keep going.


667
00:51:28.350 --> 00:51:31.870
NORTH FACE OF THE MATTERHORN
NEW RECORD


668
00:51:36.790 --> 00:51:38.510
Oh!

669
00:51:38.590 --> 00:51:40.470
- Bless you.
- Cool!


670
00:51:41.950 --> 00:51:43.470
Oh, that was tough.

671
00:51:44.270 --> 00:51:45.310
Sure!

672
00:51:48.950 --> 00:51:51.710
<i>Even after the Matterhorn record
was made public,</i>


673
00:51:51.790 --> 00:51:54.830
<i>I never heard anything about it
from Ueli Steck.</i>


674
00:51:54.910 --> 00:51:56.670
<i>I didn't send him a text either.</i>

675
00:51:58.510 --> 00:51:59.790
Oh!

676
00:52:01.710 --> 00:52:04.830
<i>With this
performance, Dani Arnold has topped</i>


677
00:52:04.910 --> 00:52:07.150
<i>the famous alpinist Ueli Steck
by ten minutes</i>


678
00:52:08.470 --> 00:52:12.190
<i>who previously held
the north face of the Matterhorn record.</i>


679
00:52:13.230 --> 00:52:14.670
<i>It's not the first time.</i>

680
00:52:14.750 --> 00:52:17.950
<i>Four years ago,
Dani Arnold set his first big record</i>


681
00:52:18.030 --> 00:52:19.750
<i>on the north face of the Eiger.</i>

682
00:52:19.830 --> 00:52:23.230
<i>There, too, he improved
on Ueli Steck's best time.</i>


683
00:52:26.910 --> 00:52:28.470
<i>Daniel Arnold.</i>

00:52:28.990 --> 00:52:30.350
<i>Ueli Steck.</i>

685

<i>Both trying to beat
each other's speed records.</i>


686
00:52:36.030 --> 00:52:39.630
<i>This duel between alpinists
is getting more and more extreme.</i>


687
00:52:44.950 --> 00:52:46.870
NORTH FACE OF THE EIGER

688
00:52:48.190 --> 00:52:51.190
Here he comes!
Oh, he's not walking quite right.


689
00:52:51.710 --> 00:52:52.990
What happened?

690
00:52:53.830 --> 00:52:56.870
I've been better.
Skiing's not really my thing.


691
00:52:57.830 --> 00:53:00.150
Right now, we're standing
in front of the Eiger


692
00:53:00.230 --> 00:53:02.630
which holds a lot of significance for you.

693
00:53:04.390 --> 00:53:08.910
But recently, your record was broken.
Someone else beat it by 19 minutes.


694
00:53:09.510 --> 00:53:11.310
Yes, Dani Arnold was a bit faster.

695
00:53:14.830 --> 00:53:16.350
That was awful, right?

696
00:53:17.030 --> 00:53:20.550
Ueli Steck is standing right in front
of the north face of the Eiger,


697
00:53:20.630 --> 00:53:23.590
and here I am, saying,
"Well, you had this record,


698
00:53:23.670 --> 00:53:27.150
but unfortunately, you don't have it
anymore. Someone was faster."


699
00:53:27.230 --> 00:53:28.390
First question!

700
00:53:30.870 --> 00:53:33.750
Personally, I don't think
he enjoyed doing media work.


701
00:53:36.190 --> 00:53:38.510
It was the price he had to pay.

702
00:53:38.590 --> 00:53:41.230
After all, all of his projects
were paid for


703
00:53:41.310 --> 00:53:44.790
through publicity and sponsorship deals.

704
00:53:46.390 --> 00:53:50.310
If I had to guess,
he was probably just too nice to admit it,


705
00:53:50.390 --> 00:53:53.990
and not enough of an asshole
to refuse to do it.


706
00:54:01.510 --> 00:54:04.150
Sometimes people ask me
if I want to beat Dani's time.


707
00:54:04.230 --> 00:54:06.030
"Don't you want to have another go?"

708
00:54:08.230 --> 00:54:11.790
And in those moments, I think to myself,
"Yeah, actually, I should."


709
00:54:29.830 --> 00:54:32.550
Ueli was always very aware
of the risk he was taking


710
00:54:32.630 --> 00:54:35.070
and the dangers he exposed himself to.

711
00:54:36.990 --> 00:54:39.150
His wife, Nicole,
always worried about him.


712
00:54:39.230 --> 00:54:41.910
She hated when he did solo expeditions.

713
00:54:43.710 --> 00:54:46.670
One time he said, "Nicole was against it,
but I still had to go."


714
00:54:46.750 --> 00:54:47.750
BOOK AUTHOR

715
00:54:51.390 --> 00:54:54.230
Ultimately, I think
the urge is so great that,


716
00:54:54.750 --> 00:54:58.390
yeah, I understand
how someone would keep chasing after it.


717
00:55:03.390 --> 00:55:05.230
We often spoke about it,

718
00:55:06.230 --> 00:55:08.270
whether or not
he should climb the Eiger again


719
00:55:08.350 --> 00:55:10.190
to try and break Dani's record.

720
00:55:19.230 --> 00:55:23.550
The fact of the matter was that he knew
he was stronger than the last time.


721
00:55:32.310 --> 00:55:35.470
And then, one day, "I think the conditions
on Eiger are really good."

NORTH FACE OF THE EIGER
DANI'S RECORD


724
00:56:08.430 --> 00:56:12.630
As a climber, you have to have
a certain amount of bravado.


725
00:56:14.870 --> 00:56:19.670
But the more I gravitate towards thinking
about it as a rivalry and a competition,


726
00:56:19.750 --> 00:56:21.510
of how it was done,

727
00:56:21.590 --> 00:56:25.110
without ropes and much of it free solo,
and I think about the stakes,


728
00:56:25.190 --> 00:56:27.870
the more I think
it's a ludicrous competition.


729
00:56:31.710 --> 00:56:33.590
It's a weird mix of things.

730
00:56:36.030 --> 00:56:41.270
To pit something with so high consequence,
uh, with a sport.


731
00:56:43.430 --> 00:56:45.870
If you lose, you die.

732
00:56:46.710 --> 00:56:49.270
It's just too... too dangerous.

733
00:57:03.670 --> 00:57:07.790
HINTERSTOISSER TRAVERSE

734
00:57:17.070 --> 00:57:19.150
The fact that he had criticized me

735
00:57:19.230 --> 00:57:22.790
for holding onto the ropes
at Hinterstoisser's Traverse,


736
00:57:22.870 --> 00:57:26.030
and now to see him
doing the exact same thing,


737
00:57:28.030 --> 00:57:29.790
it just annoyed me.

738
00:57:41.790 --> 00:57:44.710
NORTH FACE OF THE EIGER
NEW RECORD


739
00:57:55.190 --> 00:57:59.470
It was clear that losing
the record weighed heavily on his mind,


740
00:58:01.630 --> 00:58:04.070
although we said
relatively little about it.

UELI STECK GETS HIS EIGER RECORD BACK


742
00:58:08.070 --> 00:58:09.630
I find it a little...

743
00:58:10.230 --> 00:58:12.350
Honestly, I find it rather dumb.

744
00:58:13.310 --> 00:58:16.590
Of course, to make a living from this,
you need to be successful.


745
00:58:17.750 --> 00:58:19.990
But then the question remains...
How important is it?


746
00:58:20.070 --> 00:58:20.910
DANI'S FATHER

747
00:58:20.990 --> 00:58:22.350
Frankly, I can't really say.

748
00:58:23.230 --> 00:58:25.070
It's the media that keeps you relevant.

749
00:58:25.150 --> 00:58:26.030
DANI'S MOTHER

750
00:58:26.110 --> 00:58:28.166
People want something
to ask you about on television.


751
00:58:28.190 --> 00:58:31.590
I imagine it feels like
trying to get through a revolving door.


752
00:58:45.230 --> 00:58:46.990
They have to achieve something

753
00:58:47.070 --> 00:58:49.830
so the media has
something to write about again.


754
00:58:51.350 --> 00:58:53.430
So tell me, what
do you call it when...

755
00:58:53.510 --> 00:58:55.110
Not the internet...

756
00:58:56.470 --> 00:58:59.870
- Social media?
- Yes, but not just that. There's this...


757
00:58:59.950 --> 00:59:03.750
- Facebook?
- Facebook! Facebook. Facebook.


758
00:59:03.830 --> 00:59:04.990
Facebook exactly.

759
00:59:10.790 --> 00:59:13.470
Facebook and Instagram, all that stuff.

760
00:59:16.990 --> 00:59:20.910
When I see how much money is earned
from just skipping around a little...


761
00:59:21.750 --> 00:59:25.070
You know, when you call in a TV crew
for every push-up you do,


762
00:59:25.150 --> 00:59:27.990
then, yes, you have a media presence.

763
00:59:32.510 --> 00:59:35.430
I told him to leave it alone. You know?
"You don't need that."


764
00:59:35.510 --> 00:59:37.710
But I'm probably just
too old to get it.

765
00:59:42.590 --> 00:59:47.150
You can look at this whole social media
development however you want to.


766
00:59:48.310 --> 00:59:51.310
But I always have to ask myself,
"Is it really worth it?"


767
01:00:01.310 --> 01:00:04.190
FRANCE

768
01:00:08.590 --> 01:00:10.230
Competition more or less exists

769
01:00:10.310 --> 01:00:13.390
because people are
simultaneously chasing the same goals.


770
01:00:17.750 --> 01:00:19.870
As a result,
there are tons of mountaineers


771
01:00:19.950 --> 01:00:22.870
who end up making bad choices
in pursuit of victory.


772
01:00:25.190 --> 01:00:29.110
I was on the press staff
for Piolets d'Or in 2014.


773
01:00:30.510 --> 01:00:33.470
At that point, I understood
there were doubts about whether or not


774
01:00:33.550 --> 01:00:36.470
Ueli Steck had reached
the summit of Annapurna.


775
01:00:38.470 --> 01:00:43.670
Ueli Steck had no photos
or video that captured the moment,


776
01:00:43.750 --> 01:00:47.710
so he simply cannot prove
that he did reach the summit.


777
01:00:51.550 --> 01:00:53.590
I remember asking Ueli Steck

778
01:00:53.670 --> 01:00:55.670
about Annapurna behind the scenes,

779
01:00:55.750 --> 01:00:58.150
and he very clearly
brushed my question aside.


780
01:00:58.230 --> 01:01:00.830
He basically said, "It's not important."

781
01:01:04.550 --> 01:01:06.550
And I thought to myself, "How bizarre."

782
01:01:09.430 --> 01:01:12.550
And so, I started to study Steck's climbs.

783
01:01:13.510 --> 01:01:15.510
Pumori, frozen camera.

784
01:01:16.430 --> 01:01:18.830
Shishapangma, camera failure.

785
01:01:19.430 --> 01:01:22.070
Annapurna, camera lost altogether.

786
01:01:23.510 --> 01:01:25.310
Photos of the summit of Makalu?

787
01:01:25.390 --> 01:01:27.790
They may exist,
but they've never been published.


788
01:01:28.390 --> 01:01:30.150
Same with Gasherbrum 2.

789
01:01:33.550 --> 01:01:36.590
How is it that,
in the middle of the 21st century,


790
01:01:36.670 --> 01:01:38.670
with better technology than ever before,

791
01:01:38.750 --> 01:01:43.350
that a climber of his caliber could have
slipped up on taking photographs?


792
01:01:45.190 --> 01:01:47.670
It's not the first time
I didn't photograph the summit.


793
01:01:47.750 --> 01:01:51.150
And, yes, a photo is important,
proof is important,


794
01:01:51.230 --> 01:01:53.630
but when you're on
those types of rock faces,


795
01:01:53.710 --> 01:01:55.910
you don't have time to think about that.

796
01:01:55.990 --> 01:01:57.470
You need to get down quickly.

797
01:01:57.550 --> 01:01:59.030
Nothing matters but safety.

798
01:02:04.430 --> 01:02:06.590
I can only
reasonably conclude that,


799
01:02:06.670 --> 01:02:09.350
given the lack of description
and absence of physical proof,


800
01:02:09.430 --> 01:02:13.710
there is no way to confirm that Ueli Steck
reached the summit of Annapurna.


801
01:02:15.550 --> 01:02:18.190
Well, I think it's fair
that questions are being asked.


802
01:02:18.270 --> 01:02:21.270
I understand why. To take someone
at their word would be naive.


803
01:02:22.350 --> 01:02:25.230
But in order to pass fair judgement
on something like this,


804
01:02:25.310 --> 01:02:28.670
you need a great deal of expertise
and understanding of the subject.


805
01:02:31.310 --> 01:02:34.630
Rodolphe Popier, for example,
is not a mountaineer at all.


806
01:02:36.670 --> 01:02:39.270
And in this case, saying,
"You didn't reach the summit"


807
01:02:39.350 --> 01:02:41.270
basically equates to, "You're a liar."

808
01:02:42.030 --> 01:02:44.710
Anyone making a living
from their performances


809
01:02:44.790 --> 01:02:48.710
must ultimately bring back
some kind of proof of their achievement.


810
01:02:48.790 --> 01:02:51.990
INCONSISTENCIES
IN STECK'S SOLO ASCENT OF ANNAPURNA


811
01:02:52.070 --> 01:02:54.030
Some have suggested, for example,

812
01:02:54.110 --> 01:02:58.030
that you could've set a GPS route
using your watch. Why didn't you do that?


813
01:02:58.110 --> 01:03:01.510
LIES AND DOUBTS ON THE MOUNTAIN

814
01:03:02.670 --> 01:03:06.230
The purpose of the watch is
to use GPS when I'm really lost.


815
01:03:06.310 --> 01:03:08.310
It's my way to get back safely.

816
01:03:09.030 --> 01:03:11.190
And if you set it
and use it from the start,


817
01:03:11.270 --> 01:03:13.950
your battery may die
by the time you reach the summit.


818
01:03:14.750 --> 01:03:15.670
And besides,

819
01:03:15.750 --> 01:03:18.510
there's so many more important things
to think about in the moment,


820
01:03:18.590 --> 01:03:19.910
especially when climbing.

821
01:03:19.990 --> 01:03:22.710
It just wasn't a priority,
so I didn't do it.


822
01:03:26.070 --> 01:03:28.710
Dani Arnold, in your opinion,
does a top mountaineer


823
01:03:28.790 --> 01:03:30.710
have to be able to prove his achievements?

824
01:03:33.750 --> 01:03:35.870
Well, it's suspicious if you don't.

825
01:03:35.950 --> 01:03:38.390
After all, when you're considered
a super professional


826
01:03:38.470 --> 01:03:42.190
with all the marketing contracts
and management that comes with it,


827
01:03:43.670 --> 01:03:45.950
yeah, you can't keep
losing your camera like that.


828
01:03:48.710 --> 01:03:51.750
At the end of the day,
I can only be responsible for myself.


829
01:03:51.830 --> 01:03:54.510
And as a role model
for up-and-coming alpinists,


830
01:03:54.590 --> 01:03:58.110
I have to go about things
as professionally and diligently as I can.


831
01:03:59.990 --> 01:04:02.070
It all seemed kind of ridiculous
because it was like,


832
01:04:02.150 --> 01:04:05.350
this is the fittest climber in the world,
who has speed records everywhere,


833
01:04:05.430 --> 01:04:08.590
saying that he did something that seems
well within his capabilities.


834
01:04:08.670 --> 01:04:10.190
You know, like, it doesn't seem crazy.

835
01:04:10.230 --> 01:04:12.190
But, you know,
it's kind of the double-edged sword


836
01:04:12.230 --> 01:04:14.446
of being one of the most
well-known climbers in the world


837
01:04:14.470 --> 01:04:17.590
is that you're just inviting more people
to scrutinize your achievements.


838
01:04:17.670 --> 01:04:20.270
If some people want to criticize,
screw 'em.


839
01:04:20.350 --> 01:04:22.230
You know, like, that's... that's fine.

840
01:04:23.710 --> 01:04:26.670
I respect Ueli as a great climber,
for sure...


841
01:04:26.750 --> 01:04:27.630
EXTREME CLIMBER

842
01:04:27.710 --> 01:04:29.990
...but what pisses me off about Ueli

843
01:04:30.070 --> 01:04:34.270
is that he did a very bad service
to the climbing society.


844
01:04:34.350 --> 01:04:36.510
Because we earn money.

845
01:04:36.590 --> 01:04:38.910
And that's the reason

846
01:04:38.990 --> 01:04:42.870
why we always
take some proof from the mountain.


847
01:04:43.510 --> 01:04:45.950
Okay. You must know this shadow of doubt,

848
01:04:46.030 --> 01:04:48.270
this constant speculation
from your critics


849
01:04:48.350 --> 01:04:50.990
about what really happened.
You'll never dispel it.


850
01:04:51.510 --> 01:04:53.790
Yes, I know
I'll never be able to dispel them.


851
01:04:53.870 --> 01:04:56.030
I can't go back and change things.

852
01:04:56.790 --> 01:04:58.190
But that's just how it is,

853
01:04:58.270 --> 01:05:01.150
so all I can do is accept it
and live with it.


854
01:05:03.150 --> 01:05:04.230
I believed him.

855
01:05:04.310 --> 01:05:05.350
TV HOST

856
01:05:05.430 --> 01:05:07.950
But as a team, we were very divided.

857
01:05:09.590 --> 01:05:11.190
In the end, we concluded that

858
01:05:11.270 --> 01:05:14.350
only he knows
whether he reached the summit or not.


859
01:05:18.950 --> 01:05:21.550
Of course, I had hoped he'd done it.

860
01:05:22.750 --> 01:05:25.670
The idea that the pressure
had built so much


861
01:05:25.750 --> 01:05:28.590
that he had maybe considered faking it...

862
01:05:29.830 --> 01:05:32.590
that's what made me
want to believe he had made it.


863
01:05:36.430 --> 01:05:39.510
<i>What's
your next goal? Just to be even faster?</i>


864
01:05:39.590 --> 01:05:45.110
<i>Or is it about finding a route
that no one has done before?</i>


865
01:05:45.670 --> 01:05:49.230
<i>What are
your goals for the next maybe 12 months</i>


866
01:05:49.310 --> 01:05:51.670
<i>or, I don't know, maybe two years?</i>

867
01:05:52.750 --> 01:05:56.270
<i>Is your motivation
for 8,000-meter peaks back,</i>


868
01:05:56.350 --> 01:05:58.750
<i>or do you think
you're done with 8,000 now?</i>


869
01:06:01.110 --> 01:06:03.110
I don't think
it was unfamiliar to him at all,


870
01:06:03.190 --> 01:06:04.510
the search for meaning.

871
01:06:05.030 --> 01:06:08.710
Why do this? Do I still want it?
What should I do in the future?


872
01:06:11.390 --> 01:06:15.430
Every time we celebrate success,
someone always asks, "What's next?"


873
01:06:18.670 --> 01:06:21.350
Is that it?
Even without light, it's better, almost.


874
01:06:28.670 --> 01:06:32.310
So, Ueli, regarding your performances
in elite mountaineering,


875
01:06:32.390 --> 01:06:36.230
do you think that part of your life
and career has come to an end?


876
01:06:36.990 --> 01:06:38.030
Yes, I do.

877
01:06:39.670 --> 01:06:44.270
It's easy enough to say that now,
but committing to that,


878
01:06:45.070 --> 01:06:47.990
personally, it's not an easy thing to do.

879
01:06:51.110 --> 01:06:53.510
You know, it's hard to accept

880
01:06:53.590 --> 01:06:57.310
that your best and greatest
achievements are behind you...


881
01:06:58.110 --> 01:07:00.630
...when you're only 38 years old.

882
01:07:02.390 --> 01:07:04.310
You feel a bit useless.

883
01:07:05.190 --> 01:07:08.110
The first men on the moon
suffered post-landing depression.


884
01:07:08.630 --> 01:07:11.310
Men like Armstrong, Aldrin.
Can you relate to that?


885
01:07:11.830 --> 01:07:12.990
Yes, I can.

886
01:07:14.870 --> 01:07:17.910
Of course I can.
That's exactly what it feels like.


887
01:07:18.430 --> 01:07:21.510
You know, they came back from the moon,
and everyone was just,


888
01:07:21.590 --> 01:07:23.510
"Whoa!" Blah, blah, blah.

889
01:07:25.190 --> 01:07:27.510
But nobody really knows
what happened up there.


890
01:07:27.590 --> 01:07:29.150
They're the only ones who know.

891
01:07:29.230 --> 01:07:31.990
They're the only ones
who have experienced it.


892
01:07:33.230 --> 01:07:34.950
These feelings are...

893
01:07:36.070 --> 01:07:37.310
They're intense.

894
01:07:39.470 --> 01:07:40.630
And you're alone.

895
01:07:45.630 --> 01:07:49.990
That's brilliant.
Great, great. Well done. Thank you.


896
01:07:51.670 --> 01:07:54.550
- You aren't too cold?
- No, no!


897
01:07:55.910 --> 01:07:57.950
Is it worse than Annapurna?

898
01:08:03.030 --> 01:08:05.510
For a while, he insisted
he was done with the Himalayas.


899
01:08:06.270 --> 01:08:09.870
But in time, the dust had settled,
and eventually, you know...


900
01:08:19.550 --> 01:08:22.950
Namaste! Good to see you.
How are you?


901
01:08:25.150 --> 01:08:27.630
- Welcome back!
- Yeah. I'm happy to be here!


902
01:08:27.710 --> 01:08:28.710
Yeah.

903
01:08:35.230 --> 01:08:36.790
And you couldn't dissuade him.

904
01:08:37.950 --> 01:08:38.990
That was Ueli.

905
01:08:40.590 --> 01:08:41.590
He didn't give up.

906
01:08:46.470 --> 01:08:48.230
He had been there for a month.

907
01:08:49.150 --> 01:08:51.510
He said, "Come on,
let's climb Nuptse together."


908
01:08:55.870 --> 01:08:57.670
He was pleased that I was coming.

909
01:09:03.990 --> 01:09:06.990
When I got out,
I was immediately met by the Sherpa.


910
01:09:07.910 --> 01:09:10.990
And then he said,
"I have very bad news."

911
01:09:14.430 --> 01:09:15.750
"Ueli's dead."

912
01:09:23.590 --> 01:09:26.510
Of course, at first,
you just hope they're false reports,


913
01:09:26.590 --> 01:09:27.990
that it's not true.

914
01:09:32.750 --> 01:09:36.550
But then it turned out I knew the pilot
who'd recovered his body, so I called him.


915
01:09:37.870 --> 01:09:40.270
And he just said, "Yes, it's Ueli."

916
01:09:41.550 --> 01:09:45.670
He must've been careless
for a moment,


917
01:09:45.750 --> 01:09:47.430
thinking it was a very easy route.

918
01:09:47.510 --> 01:09:49.950
I heard he slipped
and fell some 1,000 meters.


919
01:09:58.230 --> 01:10:00.670
I think the accident
must have happened near the summit.


920
01:10:01.190 --> 01:10:03.710
But I believed he felt great
in the moments before,


921
01:10:03.790 --> 01:10:04.870
when he was climbing.

922
01:10:17.430 --> 01:10:20.350
The alpinism world
is in mourning today.


923
01:10:20.430 --> 01:10:23.710
We learned this morning
that Ueli Steck had a fatal accident.


924
01:10:23.790 --> 01:10:26.870
He climbed faster
than anyone else


925
01:10:26.950 --> 01:10:28.670
and usually alone, without ropes.

926
01:10:28.750 --> 01:10:32.030
Ueli Steck was Switzerland's
most well-known extreme alpinist


927
01:10:32.110 --> 01:10:35.550
and was considered one of the best
solo climbers in the world.


928
01:10:35.630 --> 01:10:38.350
Steck will be buried in Nepal,

929
01:10:38.430 --> 01:10:42.030
and his memorial will take place
in Switzerland in the upcoming days.


930
01:10:49.430 --> 01:10:52.070
SWITZERLAND

931
01:10:52.670 --> 01:10:55.150
It was
a very special memorial service


932
01:10:55.230 --> 01:10:57.430
which wasn't conducted by a priest

933
01:10:57.510 --> 01:11:00.190
but instead
by the well-known TV host Mona Vetsch


934
01:11:00.270 --> 01:11:04.470
who filmed a documentary with Ueli Steck.

935
01:11:08.990 --> 01:11:14.030
His wife, Nicole, gave me
a saying, a Tibetan proverb, and it says,


936
01:11:15.350 --> 01:11:19.790
"It's better to live one day as a tiger
than a thousand days as a sheep."


937
01:11:21.150 --> 01:11:24.350
And she said
that phrase was important to Ueli.


938
01:11:28.510 --> 01:11:31.510
We had dinner together at our house
the night before he left,


939
01:11:31.590 --> 01:11:34.390
and it was... Um,
he was at his best.

940
01:11:34.470 --> 01:11:39.630
He was at his happiest.
He was off to... to live his dream.


941
01:11:39.710 --> 01:11:41.310
And that was exactly what he said.

942
01:11:41.390 --> 01:11:44.190
He was focused on his dream,
and he was ready.


943
01:11:49.230 --> 01:11:55.910
TO KARIN. MANY, MANY THANKS.
IT WAS GREAT FUN ONCE AGAIN.


944
01:11:55.990 --> 01:11:58.350
I actually thought that,
after Annapurna,


945
01:11:58.430 --> 01:12:00.030
he'd decide to take a step back.

946
01:12:01.950 --> 01:12:04.270
But he just pushed forward until...

947
01:12:05.630 --> 01:12:10.990
There's this stupid saying,
"One day you will come unstuck."


948
01:12:22.470 --> 01:12:25.470
We mountaineers are like
one big family.


949
01:12:26.950 --> 01:12:30.390
So when we lose someone,
it really impacts all of us.


950
01:12:30.470 --> 01:12:32.230
It's very difficult.

951
01:12:34.990 --> 01:12:38.590
JULY 2018

952
01:12:39.270 --> 01:12:40.510
15 MONTHS AFTER UELI'S DEATH

953
01:12:40.590 --> 01:12:42.190
Can you roll? And...

954
01:12:43.710 --> 01:12:46.750
Quiet, please. Rolling.
Clap, clap, please.


955
01:12:48.750 --> 01:12:52.230
So why don't you start
by telling us what this is all about.


956
01:12:54.070 --> 01:12:56.590
Behind me is the Grandes Jorasses.

957
01:12:59.630 --> 01:13:04.150
And tomorrow,
I plan to climb it solo as fast as I can.


958
01:13:06.110 --> 01:13:09.310
So if you manage
to get a good time tomorrow,


959
01:13:09.390 --> 01:13:11.070
then you'll have held the speed record

960
01:13:11.150 --> 01:13:13.790
for all alpine north faces
at least once. Correct?


961
01:13:15.870 --> 01:13:17.510
Yes, I...

962
01:13:17.590 --> 01:13:20.470
I've been looking forward to tomorrow
for over a year now.


963
01:13:25.590 --> 01:13:28.590
And so I'm hoping everything goes well.

964
01:13:33.390 --> 01:13:39.150
NORTH FACE OF GRANDES JORASSES
UELI'S RECORD


965
01:13:48.110 --> 01:13:50.230
Whether or not
it was an official rivalry,


966
01:13:50.310 --> 01:13:53.190
you can't completely deny
the competitive relationship


967
01:13:53.270 --> 01:13:55.310
between you and Ueli Steck.

968
01:13:56.230 --> 01:13:59.190
Just the fact that he went back
to the north face of Eiger


969
01:13:59.270 --> 01:14:01.470
to reclaim the record for himself,

970
01:14:01.550 --> 01:14:04.590
there was always a sort of tension
between the two of you.


971
01:14:05.110 --> 01:14:06.230
Since Ueli's passing,

972
01:14:06.310 --> 01:14:09.190
do you feel that anything's
fundamentally changed for you?


973
01:14:09.270 --> 01:14:10.670
Do you ever think about it?

974
01:14:15.910 --> 01:14:18.550
Honestly, from a personal standpoint,

975
01:14:18.630 --> 01:14:21.990
nothing has really changed for me
since Ueli's accident.


976
01:14:31.070 --> 01:14:34.830
At the end of the day,
we were incredibly different people.


977
01:14:37.150 --> 01:14:40.430
But obviously,
it showed me what could happen.


978
01:14:42.190 --> 01:14:45.230
I'd like to believe that
in those life-or-death moments,


979
01:14:45.310 --> 01:14:47.750
I'd be able to stop myself in time.

980
01:14:51.350 --> 01:14:54.990
But I also know what I can do
if I push myself a little more.


981
01:15:13.150 --> 01:15:15.110
When he said
the north face of Jorasses,


982
01:15:15.190 --> 01:15:17.390
I thought, "No, 
Dani, you can't."

983
01:15:22.310 --> 01:15:24.830
I gave him a guardian angel
to take with him.


984
01:15:25.990 --> 01:15:28.670
And when he took
it, he laughed and asked,

985
01:15:29.270 --> 01:15:30.950
"Is it as fast as I am?"

986
01:15:48.230 --> 01:15:50.190
We talked about it once,

987
01:15:52.030 --> 01:15:53.750
the "what if."

988
01:15:57.270 --> 01:16:00.790
How would we handle it?
Who would be told? Things like that.


989
01:16:05.070 --> 01:16:08.310
But I don't want to spend
a lot of time thinking about that.


990
01:16:33.910 --> 01:16:35.310
The summit!

991
01:16:44.310 --> 01:16:45.590
Ah!

992
01:16:45.670 --> 01:16:47.150
So cool!

993
01:16:50.590 --> 01:16:52.710
The third great north face!

994
01:16:53.710 --> 01:16:55.590
It was faster than I thought.

995
01:17:00.750 --> 01:17:02.710
It really is so cool

996
01:17:04.390 --> 01:17:05.390
when...

997
01:17:06.070 --> 01:17:08.110
when your big dream comes true.

998
01:17:11.950 --> 01:17:13.070
Mega!

999
01:17:14.550 --> 01:17:17.150
NORTH FACE OF GRANDES JORASSES
NEW RECORD


1000
01:17:17.230 --> 01:17:20.550
<i>Some astonishing
images from a record-breaking ascent</i>


1001
01:17:20.630 --> 01:17:24.310
<i>of the north face of Grandes Jorasses
in the Mont Blanc massif.</i>


1002
01:17:24.390 --> 01:17:26.710
<i>Dani Arnold just set a new record</i>

1003
01:17:26.790 --> 01:17:30.790
<i>of only 2 hours and 4 minutes to climb
the north face of Grandes Jorasses.</i>


1004
01:17:31.790 --> 01:17:36.030
We have a man here today
who brought us some spectacular images,


1005
01:17:36.110 --> 01:17:40.030
someone who's also regarded in his circles
as an absolutely exceptional talent.


1006
01:17:40.110 --> 01:17:44.590
One of the best alpinists in the world,
but above all, one of the fastest.


1007
01:17:44.670 --> 01:17:48.710
<i>Why do all this?</i> Good question.
That's the title of his book.


1008
01:17:48.790 --> 01:17:52.430
There's only one area
where he's become more risk averse.


1009
01:17:52.510 --> 01:17:55.990
The man who risks absolutely everything
was recently asked


1010
01:17:56.070 --> 01:17:57.670
how he invests his money.

1011
01:17:57.750 --> 01:17:59.950
His very conservative answer,

1012
01:18:00.030 --> 01:18:02.230
"Stocks are really too risky for me."

1013
01:18:02.310 --> 01:18:04.510
Welcome, Dani Arnold!

1014
01:18:08.590 --> 01:18:11.950
We've got some spectacular
climbing footage for you this morning.


1015
01:18:12.030 --> 01:18:14.950
We're going to show you
Swiss extreme mountaineer Dani Arnold.


1016
01:18:16.190 --> 01:18:19.510
Now, you may have noticed
he's climbing without a safety harness,


1017
01:18:19.590 --> 01:18:21.630
which is obviously super dangerous

1018
01:18:21.710 --> 01:18:23.910
and should definitely
not be tried at home.


1019
01:18:23.990 --> 01:18:25.550
RACING FROM SUMMIT TO SUMMIT

1020
01:18:25.630 --> 01:18:29.150
Having professional photos
and videos to show to people,


1021
01:18:29.230 --> 01:18:32.230
and then, you know,
having them sent to companies


1022
01:18:32.310 --> 01:18:36.430
to use in marketing and advertising,
it's all part of the gig nowadays.


1023
01:18:36.510 --> 01:18:39.310
- Is it a business too?
- You could say that.


1024
01:18:46.750 --> 01:18:50.990
It felt strange to suddenly
see Dani in the same boat as Ueli Steck.


1025
01:18:52.150 --> 01:18:54.030
Life had completely changed.

1026
01:18:55.590 --> 01:18:57.990
<i>Dani is from
the SchÃ¤chen valley</i>


1027
01:18:58.070 --> 01:18:59.870
<i>and has started a really crazy project.</i>

1028
01:19:00.390 --> 01:19:02.510
<i>The Three Peaks in the Dolomites.</i>

1029
01:19:02.590 --> 01:19:04.030
<i>Dani Arnold from Switzerland</i>

1030
01:19:04.110 --> 01:19:08.510
<i>took on the legendary,

1031
01:19:12.470 --> 01:19:14.750
Dani Arnold, why do all this?

1032
01:19:15.550 --> 01:19:19.230
Well, why shouldn't I do it?

1033
01:19:20.630 --> 01:19:24.710
But what if you make a mistake?
If there isn't a better hold above you?


1034
01:19:26.190 --> 01:19:27.830
Yeah, well...

1035
01:19:28.350 --> 01:19:31.670
I take this pretty seriously.

1036
01:19:31.750 --> 01:19:33.430
That doesn't happen.

1037
01:19:37.390 --> 01:19:40.550
Do you get a bad night's sleep
beforehand? Or a good one?


1038
01:19:40.630 --> 01:19:42.110
Do you get scared?

1039
01:19:42.870 --> 01:19:45.630
Well, right before you go,

1040
01:19:46.350 --> 01:19:48.110
you get scared.

1041
01:19:48.190 --> 01:19:51.790
At last, a normal human statement.
I like that.


1042
01:19:56.790 --> 01:19:59.630
I think
it's a good thing to be scared of heights.


1043
01:20:03.510 --> 01:20:06.310
But making sure
that fear has a positive impact,


1044
01:20:06.390 --> 01:20:09.230
that it serves to empower you
and not paralyze you...


1045
01:20:12.430 --> 01:20:14.470
that's the real trick behind it all.

1046
01:20:30.630 --> 01:20:32.390
To me, Dani comes across

1047
01:20:32.470 --> 01:20:34.910
as very neighborly,
like he's just your fellow mountain guide.


1048
01:20:37.550 --> 01:20:40.910
But the fact that he also has
this ability to set these records,


1049
01:20:40.990 --> 01:20:42.470
it's just crazy.

1050
01:20:50.310 --> 01:20:53.550
<i>Free solo climbing speed record
for climbing the "Cima Grande"</i>


1051
01:20:53.630 --> 01:20:55.310
<i>in the Italian Dolomite range.</i>

1052
01:20:55.390 --> 01:20:59.710
<i>Arnold climbed the mountain face

1053
01:21:04.310 --> 01:21:06.270
My name is Dani Arnold.

1054
01:21:06.350 --> 01:21:08.990
I come from BÃ¼rglen
in the canton of Uri.

1055
01:21:09.070 --> 01:21:10.070
NORTH FACE OF THE EIGER

1056
01:21:10.110 --> 01:21:12.310
I climbed
the north face of the Eiger.


1057
01:21:12.390 --> 01:21:14.270
It didn't take too long.

1058
01:21:15.870 --> 01:21:20.350
Yes, and now Ueli Steck
has done it six minutes faster.


1059
01:21:21.910 --> 01:21:24.670
That's not at all ideal, of course.

1060
01:21:27.110 --> 01:21:29.470
I don't know if I'll
try it again or not.

1061
01:21:32.590 --> 01:21:35.750
Truthfully,
I think it maybe hurts Dani,


1062
01:21:35.830 --> 01:21:39.950
knowing that he's never been able
to achieve the same status of Ueli.


1063
01:21:42.910 --> 01:21:45.150
So the big question remains...

1064
01:21:45.230 --> 01:21:48.830
Do we keep playing this game?
And, if so, where does it end?


1065
01:21:51.070 --> 01:21:54.110
Because, ultimately,
speed-climbing at that level


1066
01:21:54.190 --> 01:21:56.150
is just a matter of statistics.

1067
01:21:57.590 --> 01:21:59.710
If you don't ever reach a stopping point,

1068
01:21:59.790 --> 01:22:03.190
then it's only inevitable that,
one day, it's going to kill you.


1069
01:22:18.630 --> 01:22:20.590
How did your view
of the world change


1070
01:22:20.670 --> 01:22:22.070
with the birth of your daughter?

1071
01:22:22.710 --> 01:22:25.630
Honestly, I don't feel
like things have changed that much for me.


1072
01:22:25.710 --> 01:22:27.630
I have an extra responsibility, sure,

1073
01:22:27.710 --> 01:22:29.990
but if I had changed everything
for Ladina's sake,


1074
01:22:30.070 --> 01:22:32.510
I'd feel as though everything I'd done
beforehand was wrong.


1075
01:22:39.030 --> 01:22:40.830
Wow, you're awesome!

1076
01:22:41.550 --> 01:22:42.630
Hmm?

1077
01:22:49.830 --> 01:22:52.710
Spending your life
with a star mountaineer


1078
01:22:53.630 --> 01:22:55.190
isn't always enjoyable.

1079
01:22:57.710 --> 01:23:02.590
Are we going climbing?
If we can't go climbing, we're lost.


1080
01:23:05.470 --> 01:23:07.190
Even when I was pregnant,

1081
01:23:07.270 --> 01:23:09.710
everyone just kept asking me,
"How do you deal with it?"


1082
01:23:09.790 --> 01:23:13.190
"The risks he takes,
how dangerous it all is... How do you deal?"


1083
01:23:32.710 --> 01:23:35.590
Truthfully, my thinking
hasn't changed that much.


1084
01:23:36.310 --> 01:23:37.550
I know he can say no

1085
01:23:37.630 --> 01:23:40.470
and that he'll come back safely
if the climb's too risky.


1086
01:23:43.150 --> 01:23:44.670
I'm counting on that.

1087
01:23:47.630 --> 01:23:51.270
NORTH FACE OF THE EIGER

1088
01:24:03.070 --> 01:24:04.910
I love what I do.

1089
01:24:06.390 --> 01:24:10.190
And if you get enough recognition for it
and can make a living from it,


1090
01:24:10.270 --> 01:24:11.870
that's great too.

1091
01:24:13.470 --> 01:24:17.350
But I don't climb for the publicity.
I climb for myself.


1092
01:24:18.990 --> 01:24:22.150
I just have heard that,
and... and I did hear from Ueli too,


1093
01:24:22.230 --> 01:24:26.910
this whole argument that was,
"Well, I really did this for myself."


1094
01:24:26.990 --> 01:24:30.390
It's like, "Climbing is just an adventure,
and I'm just doing it for myself."


1095
01:24:30.470 --> 01:24:33.230
Well, then why am I hearing about it?
You know? I mean...


1096
01:24:34.590 --> 01:24:36.990
If you're just doing it for yourself,
just do it for yourself


1097
01:24:37.030 --> 01:24:38.430
and don't tell anybody you did it.

1098
01:24:38.510 --> 01:24:40.510
MAN AGAINST ICE

1099
01:24:40.590 --> 01:24:43.190
As soon as you start going public,
making a living out of it,


1100
01:24:43.270 --> 01:24:45.870
and as soon as you start saying,
"I pressed a button."


1101
01:24:45.950 --> 01:24:47.910
"Here's how fast I did it,"

1102
01:24:47.990 --> 01:24:51.150
you inherently incorporate
that competitive aspect of it.


1103
01:24:53.950 --> 01:24:55.590
<i>Welcome, Ueli Steck.</i>

1104
01:24:58.550 --> 01:25:00.310
<i>Faster, higher, further.</i>

1105
01:25:00.390 --> 01:25:04.830
<i>Ueli Steck is pushing the boundaries
of alpinism higher and higher.</i>


1106
01:25:05.430 --> 01:25:08.350
<i>And at the same time,
you ask when will the next one come</i>


1107
01:25:08.430 --> 01:25:11.430
<i>and beat his record this time?</i>

1108
01:25:12.910 --> 01:25:15.190
Recently,
your record was broken.


1109
01:25:15.270 --> 01:25:17.270
Someone else beat it by 19 minutes.

1110
01:25:17.870 --> 01:25:19.670
Yes, Dani Arnold was a bit faster.

1111
01:25:24.230 --> 01:25:27.710
This rivalry, especially seeing it
in this extreme environment,


1112
01:25:27.790 --> 01:25:29.790
has fascinated a lot of people.

1113
01:25:31.830 --> 01:25:33.270
But we need to ask ourselves,

1114
01:25:33.350 --> 01:25:37.230
how are we reporting these things,
and is there a real reason to do so?


1115
01:25:37.310 --> 01:25:38.590
And I'm including myself.

1116
01:25:41.950 --> 01:25:45.670
For example, does record breaking
have to be the standard for recognition?


1117
01:25:45.750 --> 01:25:48.710
If we're being honest, we know
there's not always proof of that.


1118
01:25:52.590 --> 01:25:55.230
Isn't it enough
for someone to just be really good?


1119
01:25:55.310 --> 01:25:57.030
Do they always have to be the best?

1120
01:26:09.870 --> 01:26:13.350
Eventually, I realized that Ueli
just did it better than I ever could.


1121
01:26:17.030 --> 01:26:19.990
But it was kind of difficult
for me to accept.


1122
01:26:23.350 --> 01:26:26.150
Ultimately, though, it's just a sport.

1123
01:26:28.950 --> 01:26:31.630
I broke Ueli's record, 
Ueli broke mine,

1124
01:26:33.110 --> 01:26:36.390
and, one day,
someone faster than him will come along.


1125
01:26:40.470 --> 01:26:42.230
I just have to accept that.

1126
01:26:45.470 --> 01:26:47.350
And then, at some point,

1127
01:26:47.430 --> 01:26:49.750
you'll have to start
thinking about quitting.


1128
01:26:59.790 --> 01:27:06.070
DANI ARNOLD IS STILL CLIMBING
ALL OVER THE WORLD


1129
01:27:07.910 --> 01:27:13.630
HE HOLDS SPEED RECORDS
FOR ALL THE GREAT NORTH FACES


1130
01:27:14.790 --> 01:27:16.110
WITH ONE EXCEPTION:

1131
01:27:16.190 --> 01:27:19.670
UELI STECK STILL
HAS THE FASTEST TIME FOR THE EIGER


1132
01:27:21.910 --> 01:27:26.550
THIS FILM IS DEDICATED TO HIS MEMORY
