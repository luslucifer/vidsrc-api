2
00:01:28.214 --> 00:01:29.213
Attack front!

3
00:01:35.789 --> 00:01:36.788
<i>Macht schnell!</i>

4
00:01:41.528 --> 00:01:42.660
Let's go!

5
00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:49.033
<i>Macht schnell!</i>

6
00:01:56.676 --> 00:01:58.776
Go, go, go!

7
00:02:02.248 --> 00:02:04.549
Move it up! Let's go!

8
00:02:11.958 --> 00:02:13.191
Gun's down again!

9
00:02:13.193 --> 00:02:15.293
Engine's still
locked up, Lance!


10
00:02:18.565 --> 00:02:19.864
Go, go, go!

11
00:02:33.813 --> 00:02:36.180
We're getting our asses
kicked here, Lance!


12
00:02:36.182 --> 00:02:38.683
We have to hold the line till
phase two of the aerial bombing,


13
00:02:38.685 --> 00:02:40.251
and we can't even
get in the fight!


14
00:02:40.253 --> 00:02:42.553
Afternoon ain't
coming soon enough!


15
00:02:42.555 --> 00:02:44.755
Long as we're
long gone before then!


16
00:02:52.999 --> 00:02:56.501
Sarge, we can leave
anytime you give the word!


17
00:02:56.503 --> 00:02:59.403
I hate to say it, but
I'm with CK on this one.


18
00:02:59.405 --> 00:03:02.406
We need to advance to
the rear and regroup!


19
00:03:02.408 --> 00:03:03.708
Negative, Sergeant Rose!

20
00:03:14.521 --> 00:03:16.754
Move up! Move up!

21
00:03:23.963 --> 00:03:25.830
We hold them here!

22
00:03:31.538 --> 00:03:33.538
Move! Move! Move!
Get on your feet!


23
00:03:35.942 --> 00:03:38.276
We push through
until air support comes!


24
00:03:38.278 --> 00:03:39.844
Aw, for hell's sake!

25
00:03:39.846 --> 00:03:41.212
We're surrounded by Nazis!

26
00:03:41.214 --> 00:03:44.715
Doesn't matter if we go
forwards or backwards!


27
00:03:57.163 --> 00:04:00.064
McNay, get us around those
tanks over there! You copy?


28
00:04:00.066 --> 00:04:01.499
Copy that, Sarge!

29
00:04:01.501 --> 00:04:02.700
We're mighty low on fuel!

30
00:04:02.702 --> 00:04:04.202
We don't get
around those tanks,


31
00:04:04.204 --> 00:04:06.404
fuel's gonna be
the least of our concerns!


32
00:04:06.406 --> 00:04:08.306
Copy that.

33
00:04:11.177 --> 00:04:13.044
Come on!

34
00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:23.321
Does anything
on this tank work?


35
00:04:23.323 --> 00:04:24.989
Gunner's always
ready and willing!


36
00:04:24.991 --> 00:04:26.824
Oh, well, let's just
take out those tanks


37
00:04:26.826 --> 00:04:28.726
and keep advancing, okay?

38
00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:46.644
We got one ahead!

39
00:04:46.646 --> 00:04:48.487
Rose and I will take it out!

40
00:04:48.848 --> 00:04:51.148
Rest of you, sit tight!

41
00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:52.783
Watch our six!

42
00:04:54.887 --> 00:04:58.556
Sergeant Lance Dawson
playing hero again.


43
00:04:58.558 --> 00:04:59.690
This thing goes sideways,

44
00:04:59.692 --> 00:05:00.758
you keep this thing moving.

45
00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:02.293
You don't stop rolling

46
00:05:02.295 --> 00:05:03.894
till you see friendly faces

47
00:05:03.896 --> 00:05:05.496
or Saint Peter's gates.

48
00:05:05.498 --> 00:05:06.964
Copy that!

49
00:05:09.002 --> 00:05:12.203
Well, at least this crate's
not a burnin' Sherman.


50
00:05:12.205 --> 00:05:13.704
Let's do this!
- You'd better be quick.


51
00:05:13.706 --> 00:05:15.867
It looks like we're
going to get some rain.


52
00:05:24.417 --> 00:05:25.549
Plan, Sarge?

53
00:05:25.551 --> 00:05:27.752
The basic rodeo roundup.

54
00:05:27.754 --> 00:05:29.553
I'll go to the left. You
catch 'em on the right.


55
00:05:29.555 --> 00:05:31.522
I've known about
the rodeo roundup


56
00:05:31.524 --> 00:05:33.424
since the 761st,
Sergeant Dawson.


57
00:05:33.426 --> 00:05:35.192
Any problems there, Sarge?

58
00:05:35.194 --> 00:05:36.294
Never a problem!

59
00:05:36.296 --> 00:05:37.428
I just want to be able to see

60
00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:39.897
my wife and kids
again just like you!


61
00:05:39.899 --> 00:05:41.299
We don't have any kids!

62
00:05:41.301 --> 00:05:42.533
Not for lack of trying!

63
00:05:42.535 --> 00:05:43.934
Let's go!

64
00:06:04.924 --> 00:06:07.004
Hey the Rain's
letting up, let's go!


65
00:06:12.432 --> 00:06:14.932
Oh, hey. Good to see you guys.

66
00:06:14.934 --> 00:06:17.301
Miss us? 
- Ah, getting bored.

67
00:06:17.303 --> 00:06:19.270
Ready? Move her out!

68
00:06:19.272 --> 00:06:21.038
Back to American lines!

69
00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:23.174
Forward ho, Sarge!

70
00:06:30.783 --> 00:06:33.718
Lance, we're cut off
from the column.


71
00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:36.253
Freddy, how we doing?

72
00:06:36.255 --> 00:06:38.015
We're mighty low on fuel!

73
00:06:38.424 --> 00:06:40.265
Let's get as far as we can!

74
00:06:41.828 --> 00:06:44.061
Well, you guys
better hit the ground!


75
00:06:48.601 --> 00:06:50.968
Now, soldiers, we're
well over enemy lines,


76
00:06:50.970 --> 00:06:53.404
so get into tank formation,
and be on the lookout.


77
00:06:53.406 --> 00:06:56.941
Keep your eyes peeled
for the enemy!


78
00:07:15.795 --> 00:07:17.228
Piece of junk!

79
00:07:27.640 --> 00:07:28.973
Looks like we're all clear.

80
00:07:28.975 --> 00:07:30.040
For now.

81
00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:48.993
Well, I guess that's
the end of that.


82
00:07:48.995 --> 00:07:50.127
Can it, Private.

83
00:07:52.465 --> 00:07:53.531
Bad news, Lance.

84
00:07:53.533 --> 00:07:54.799
We're dry.

85
00:07:56.769 --> 00:07:57.768
Yeah, Sarge?

86
00:07:57.770 --> 00:07:58.969
Where's that fuel point,
Private?


87
00:07:58.971 --> 00:08:00.438
Radio confirmed a supply truck

88
00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:02.440
about a kilometer
east of us, stationary.


89
00:08:02.442 --> 00:08:03.507
All right.

90
00:08:07.113 --> 00:08:09.033
We'd better
get a move on, then.


91
00:09:20.186 --> 00:09:21.252
<i>Fr?ulein.</i>

92
00:09:40.806 --> 00:09:41.906
Hey.

93
00:09:54.487 --> 00:09:56.020
Take him out.

94
00:10:05.097 --> 00:10:07.977
Rose, mission first.
Then check the girl.


95
00:10:16.709 --> 00:10:18.342
Shit. No go!

96
00:10:18.344 --> 00:10:20.277
We're gonna have to carry it!

97
00:10:29.422 --> 00:10:31.255
Are you okay?

98
00:10:41.033 --> 00:10:42.833
We got company coming!

99
00:10:42.835 --> 00:10:45.202
We gotta go! Come with us!

100
00:10:45.204 --> 00:10:48.305
Come on! Come on! Let's go!

101
00:11:02.955 --> 00:11:05.623
For once, I'm glad to see
you guys can't follow orders.


102
00:11:05.625 --> 00:11:08.592
Sergeant McNay thought
you could use some help.


103
00:11:08.594 --> 00:11:10.314
He was right.

104
00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:23.941
Private Sommers,
let's make this quick.


105
00:11:23.943 --> 00:11:24.942
Turret's jammed,

106
00:11:24.944 --> 00:11:26.824
and the breach is stuck again!

107
00:11:27.413 --> 00:11:30.914
Griffin, get these cans
back there.


108
00:11:30.916 --> 00:11:33.017
Get this beast fueled up.
Freddy!


109
00:11:33.019 --> 00:11:34.084
Hey!

110
00:11:34.186 --> 00:11:35.285
Get this thing fueled up!

111
00:11:35.287 --> 00:11:36.854
You get this beast moving!

112
00:11:36.856 --> 00:11:38.355
Let me get the radio!

113
00:11:38.357 --> 00:11:41.759
Freddy! Give me a hand
clearing this damn thing!


114
00:11:41.761 --> 00:11:42.826
Almighty, Almighty,

115
00:11:42.828 --> 00:11:43.861
this is 3-6 Actual

116
00:11:43.863 --> 00:11:45.663
requesting air support. Over!

117
00:11:45.665 --> 00:11:49.033
3-6, this is Almighty.
Negative on air support.


118
00:11:49.035 --> 00:11:50.834
Maintain radio silence
now forward.


119
00:11:50.836 --> 00:11:52.736
3-6 Actual. Out.

120
00:11:52.738 --> 00:11:54.605
Copy that, Almighty. Out!

121
00:11:54.607 --> 00:11:56.874
Another minute, Sarge!

122
00:11:56.876 --> 00:11:58.108
Freddy.

123
00:11:59.879 --> 00:12:01.645
All right, listen up!

124
00:12:01.647 --> 00:12:04.481
We have to move
to rally point two ASAP.


125
00:12:04.483 --> 00:12:07.084
When we get there,
we're gonna stay put


126
00:12:07.086 --> 00:12:09.687
and maintain radio silence.

127
00:12:09.689 --> 00:12:11.221
You speak English? 
- I do.

128
00:12:11.223 --> 00:12:12.389
What's your name?

129
00:12:12.391 --> 00:12:14.191
Sister Claudette. 
- Sister?

130
00:12:14.193 --> 00:12:16.160
Are you hurt, Sister Claudette?

131
00:12:16.162 --> 00:12:17.995
No, where do we go?

132
00:12:17.997 --> 00:12:20.698
We're going to a military rally
point, where you'll be relocated.


133
00:12:20.700 --> 00:12:22.566
You're safe as long
as you're with us.


134
00:12:22.568 --> 00:12:23.634
I must get back!

135
00:12:23.636 --> 00:12:24.935
Calm down, Sister.

136
00:12:24.937 --> 00:12:26.970
Hey, get down!

137
00:12:26.972 --> 00:12:28.572
Watch the fire, Griff!

138
00:12:34.547 --> 00:12:36.480
Sommers, we don't
have that much time.


139
00:12:36.482 --> 00:12:39.316
30 more seconds, Sarge!

140
00:12:41.887 --> 00:12:43.854
The children, they need me!

141
00:12:43.856 --> 00:12:45.389
Children? What children?

142
00:12:45.391 --> 00:12:48.158
I run an orphanage
with Mother Mary Ellen.


143
00:12:48.160 --> 00:12:49.193
There... There are many orphans!

144
00:12:49.195 --> 00:12:50.327
They must be saved!

145
00:12:56.235 --> 00:12:57.868
I... I live with the children.

146
00:12:57.870 --> 00:13:00.003
Kids? What kind
of nun has kids?


147
00:13:00.005 --> 00:13:02.740
Nuns run orphanages,
you dumb-ass!


148
00:13:02.742 --> 00:13:04.975
Orphans, yes! I must go!

149
00:13:04.977 --> 00:13:06.210
Hey! Hey! You can't make it

150
00:13:06.212 --> 00:13:08.512
back to the orphanage
by yourself!


151
00:13:08.514 --> 00:13:10.614
I don't know how
you got this far alone.


152
00:13:10.616 --> 00:13:12.616
I had an American escort.

153
00:13:12.618 --> 00:13:14.718
American escort?

154
00:13:15.721 --> 00:13:18.322
They were executed
by the Germans.


155
00:13:18.324 --> 00:13:20.224
Freddy, give me the map!

156
00:13:28.267 --> 00:13:30.400
Watch... Keep your head down!

157
00:13:30.402 --> 00:13:31.969
Hey.

158
00:13:34.573 --> 00:13:36.340
We're here.

159
00:13:36.342 --> 00:13:37.574
Where's your orphanage?

160
00:13:37.576 --> 00:13:38.642
Uh...

161
00:13:39.078 --> 00:13:40.144
Here?

162
00:13:40.479 --> 00:13:42.045
Rose, that's three clicks east.

163
00:13:42.047 --> 00:13:44.248
Rally point's
five clicks north!


164
00:13:44.250 --> 00:13:46.350
Almost there, Sarge!

165
00:13:46.352 --> 00:13:50.988
We don't have a lot of time
to get to that rally point.


166
00:13:52.191 --> 00:13:53.891
We're already a
kilometer off-course.


167
00:13:53.893 --> 00:13:56.193
Three clicks east,
pick up a bunch of kids,


168
00:13:56.195 --> 00:13:58.095
then hike back to here,

169
00:13:58.097 --> 00:13:59.563
plus another five clicks north,

170
00:13:59.565 --> 00:14:01.465
and that's pretty
shaky ground, Sarge.


171
00:14:01.467 --> 00:14:03.801
Rose, what if we
go straight there?


172
00:14:03.803 --> 00:14:06.103
Well, we got a...
a chance of making it


173
00:14:06.105 --> 00:14:07.805
to the rally point
before the bombs fall.


174
00:14:07.807 --> 00:14:09.139
Chance? What kind of chance?

175
00:14:09.141 --> 00:14:11.542
A slim one! But it's...

176
00:14:11.544 --> 00:14:13.277
it's better than the chance

177
00:14:13.278 --> 00:14:16.238
that those kids have making
it through the operation.


178
00:14:17.950 --> 00:14:19.583
One more can! One
more can, Sarge!


179
00:14:19.585 --> 00:14:20.584
One more can!

180
00:14:20.586 --> 00:14:22.753
We can't risk it.

181
00:14:23.556 --> 00:14:25.222
I'm sorry, Sister. 
- No!

182
00:14:25.224 --> 00:14:26.924
Sarge, Sarge, I don't
think you heard me.


183
00:14:26.926 --> 00:14:28.992
I heard you
just fine, Sergeant.


184
00:14:28.994 --> 00:14:31.728
I said a slim chance,
you know, but...


185
00:14:31.730 --> 00:14:33.330
Yeah, I'm aware of that,
Sergeant!


186
00:14:33.332 --> 00:14:36.834
Well, holy shit! I'm with
the Sarge on this one!


187
00:14:36.836 --> 00:14:38.335
What did your father
used to always say?


188
00:14:38.337 --> 00:14:39.870
If you're gonna die,
you might as well


189
00:14:39.872 --> 00:14:41.104
go ahead and die...

190
00:14:41.106 --> 00:14:43.006
Doing the right thing, yeah.

191
00:14:43.008 --> 00:14:44.808
And in my eyes,
this is the right thing.


192
00:14:44.810 --> 00:14:46.743
I usually back your
play, but look at her!


193
00:14:46.745 --> 00:14:49.413
This is not a damn vote
at the Rotary Club, Sergeant!


194
00:14:49.415 --> 00:14:51.915
What you're saying could get
us all killed, kids included!


195
00:14:51.917 --> 00:14:53.584
I say we get the kids!

196
00:14:53.586 --> 00:14:56.707
At least give 'em a chance to
make it through the operation.


197
00:14:57.590 --> 00:15:00.924
Look, they may not be our kids,

198
00:15:00.926 --> 00:15:02.767
but they're someone's kids.

199
00:15:04.430 --> 00:15:05.495
All right, that's it!

200
00:15:05.497 --> 00:15:07.097
Good to go!

201
00:15:10.402 --> 00:15:11.401
Traversing! Put your head down.

202
00:15:11.403 --> 00:15:12.402
Put your head down.

203
00:15:12.404 --> 00:15:13.637
Get ready!

204
00:15:16.075 --> 00:15:18.976
Lance, you better
cover your ears!


205
00:15:21.380 --> 00:15:23.113
Firing!

206
00:15:38.197 --> 00:15:39.596
Clear!

207
00:15:46.705 --> 00:15:49.806
Freddy, you get this beast
to the rally point.


208
00:15:49.808 --> 00:15:50.941
You gotta be kidding me!

209
00:15:50.943 --> 00:15:52.709
Am I the only one
thinking straight here?


210
00:15:52.711 --> 00:15:54.344
Look, I feel for those orphans,

211
00:15:54.346 --> 00:15:56.513
I really do, but you
said it yourself.


212
00:15:56.515 --> 00:15:59.116
We barely stand a chance of
making it in one piece now.


213
00:15:59.118 --> 00:16:02.586
I don't see how having these
kids die with us is gonna help.


214
00:16:02.588 --> 00:16:04.488
Now, look, Sarge, I know that
you got a lot on your plate...


215
00:16:04.490 --> 00:16:07.758
CK, Rose, Griffin,

216
00:16:07.760 --> 00:16:09.693
we'll be on foot.

217
00:16:09.695 --> 00:16:11.161
Hey, we'll be able to hit

218
00:16:11.163 --> 00:16:12.195
a few of these rough shortcuts

219
00:16:12.197 --> 00:16:14.197
you can't navigate
through, all right?


220
00:16:14.199 --> 00:16:17.501
We pick up those kids,
we'll come out here.


221
00:16:17.503 --> 00:16:21.538
That's right along the route.
Give us one hour.


222
00:16:21.540 --> 00:16:24.041
If we're not there, you
keep this beast moving,


223
00:16:24.043 --> 00:16:25.776
and you don't stop till
you hit that rally point.


224
00:16:25.778 --> 00:16:27.611
I'm not leaving you, Lance.

225
00:16:27.613 --> 00:16:29.413
That's an order, soldier.

226
00:16:30.282 --> 00:16:32.082
Copy that.

227
00:16:32.084 --> 00:16:34.985
Rose, you take point for now.

228
00:16:34.987 --> 00:16:37.587
Sister, show him the way.

229
00:16:37.589 --> 00:16:38.655
All right.

230
00:16:42.394 --> 00:16:44.861
We'll be looking out
for you, Sarge!


231
00:16:44.863 --> 00:16:47.030
You better be!

232
00:16:47.032 --> 00:16:49.700
If the Krauts don't
get us, Dawson will.


233
00:16:49.702 --> 00:16:52.035
Come on, Griff. Griff!

234
00:16:52.037 --> 00:16:53.757
Back me up on this one.

235
00:16:54.873 --> 00:16:56.406
FIGMO.

236
00:17:25.637 --> 00:17:27.671
Hey, look, uh, Sarge,

237
00:17:27.673 --> 00:17:33.043
um, how we know she ain't leading
us into some kind of trap?


238
00:17:33.045 --> 00:17:35.845
That sounds
pretty unlikely, Private.


239
00:17:36.148 --> 00:17:38.048
I... I just ain't
buying it. I mean,


240
00:17:38.050 --> 00:17:40.684
what the hell's a nun
doing out here, anyway?


241
00:17:40.686 --> 00:17:43.120
She don't even sound French.

242
00:17:43.122 --> 00:17:44.855
I just ain't buying it.

243
00:17:44.857 --> 00:17:46.690
CK, if it is a trap,

244
00:17:46.692 --> 00:17:47.924
it's a pretty weak one.

245
00:17:47.926 --> 00:17:49.646
Get back in formation.

246
00:17:50.295 --> 00:17:52.162
Sergeant's right, CK.

247
00:17:52.164 --> 00:17:53.830
We're behind enemy lines.

248
00:17:53.832 --> 00:17:55.365
We're trapped already.

249
00:18:09.915 --> 00:18:13.617
I wouldn't expect to see any
friendly faces anytime soon.


250
00:18:31.236 --> 00:18:33.937
We still need
to do this, Sarge?


251
00:18:45.451 --> 00:18:47.717
They may not be our kids,

252
00:18:47.719 --> 00:18:49.486
but they were someone's.

253
00:19:20.285 --> 00:19:23.887
You should have been more
cooperative, shouldn't you?


254
00:19:23.889 --> 00:19:27.724
I lost six good men,

255
00:19:27.726 --> 00:19:28.792
friends!

256
00:19:29.495 --> 00:19:31.761
Because your brother
helped the Americans,


257
00:19:31.763 --> 00:19:34.030
he is now dead!

258
00:19:36.101 --> 00:19:41.505
I want to know everything he told
you about the American plans.


259
00:19:41.507 --> 00:19:43.206
But I... I do not know.

260
00:19:43.208 --> 00:19:45.909
H-He never told me anything
the American spies told him.


261
00:19:45.911 --> 00:19:47.344
- You lie! No!

262
00:19:47.346 --> 00:19:48.612
No, it is the truth!

263
00:19:48.614 --> 00:19:50.914
He never told me anything!

264
00:19:50.916 --> 00:19:52.549
I think you lie.

265
00:19:52.551 --> 00:19:54.484
No, no! I don't know!

266
00:19:54.486 --> 00:19:55.552
I don't know!

267
00:19:56.155 --> 00:19:57.521
Tell me everything!

268
00:19:57.523 --> 00:19:59.823
No, no. This is my family.

269
00:19:59.825 --> 00:20:02.993
This is my family! No! No!

270
00:20:02.995 --> 00:20:04.995
I find you peasants
hard to believe.


271
00:20:05.831 --> 00:20:07.697
No, it's true.

272
00:20:07.699 --> 00:20:09.833
No, my family.

273
00:20:10.269 --> 00:20:11.701
No!

274
00:20:17.876 --> 00:20:19.142
Now...

275
00:20:19.144 --> 00:20:22.479
tell me of the American plans.

276
00:20:22.481 --> 00:20:25.782
I want to know now!

277
00:20:40.799 --> 00:20:42.799
That's not too far
from here, Sarge.


278
00:20:44.469 --> 00:20:48.004
Hey, no matter what
happens, stay here.


279
00:20:48.006 --> 00:20:49.039
Stay low.

280
00:20:49.041 --> 00:20:50.106
No, I must... 
- Ehp! Ehp!

281
00:20:50.108 --> 00:20:51.308
You stay here.

282
00:20:51.777 --> 00:20:53.176
Wait for me.

283
00:21:05.924 --> 00:21:07.023
No!

284
00:21:10.729 --> 00:21:15.065
This is what you get
for helping the Americans.


285
00:21:15.067 --> 00:21:18.335
I want to know everything
they told your brother.


286
00:21:18.337 --> 00:21:19.970
I know nothing!

287
00:21:19.972 --> 00:21:21.104
And I want to know now!
- Nothing!


288
00:21:21.106 --> 00:21:22.939
Nothing!

289
00:21:34.019 --> 00:21:36.253
Sarge, we got a problem here.

290
00:21:37.789 --> 00:21:39.489
Jesus.

291
00:21:39.491 --> 00:21:41.625
Rose, clear the front

292
00:21:41.627 --> 00:21:42.892
so we can get to that officer.

293
00:21:42.894 --> 00:21:45.195
CK, take out that vehicle.

294
00:21:45.197 --> 00:21:46.763
Nothing!

295
00:21:46.765 --> 00:21:48.064
I could take the first one,

296
00:21:48.066 --> 00:21:49.866
but the officer's
too close to the woman.


297
00:21:49.868 --> 00:21:51.868
Ah, shit. We got dead
civilians out there.


298
00:21:51.870 --> 00:21:52.869
Some of 'em are kids.

299
00:21:52.871 --> 00:21:55.238
I see it. Take him, Rose.

300
00:21:55.240 --> 00:21:56.306
Wilco.

301
00:22:34.146 --> 00:22:35.912
Hold your fire!

302
00:22:35.914 --> 00:22:37.981
We have you surrounded!

303
00:22:37.983 --> 00:22:40.216
Your vehicle is disabled!

304
00:22:40.218 --> 00:22:43.053
Surrender now!

305
00:22:43.055 --> 00:22:46.356
We have a woman
in here, a civilian,


306
00:22:46.358 --> 00:22:48.458
an innocent woman!

307
00:22:48.460 --> 00:22:50.327
Come out with your hands up!

308
00:22:54.800 --> 00:22:57.500
You send the woman out
without any further harm,


309
00:22:57.502 --> 00:22:59.703
I promise that you and your men

310
00:22:59.705 --> 00:23:01.905
will be treated
as prisoners of war


311
00:23:01.907 --> 00:23:04.668
in accordance with the
Geneva Convention!


312
00:23:07.946 --> 00:23:11.181
Sarge, I say we fill
that house full of lead


313
00:23:11.183 --> 00:23:12.649
while we still got the chance.

314
00:23:12.651 --> 00:23:14.918
Just sit tight, soldier.

315
00:23:26.965 --> 00:23:29.232
They've got
a grenade on her, Rose.


316
00:23:32.671 --> 00:23:34.170
Let the woman go!

317
00:23:37.376 --> 00:23:39.442
Let the woman go now!

318
00:23:46.118 --> 00:23:49.085
Your nine! Officer's
heading into the woods!


319
00:23:49.087 --> 00:23:51.254
Hold your fire, CK.

320
00:24:10.075 --> 00:24:11.141
Ah, shit!

321
00:24:47.779 --> 00:24:48.778
Jesus.

322
00:24:48.780 --> 00:24:50.780
Secure the area now!

323
00:24:50.782 --> 00:24:53.550
Hey, we got a survivor, Sarge!

324
00:24:54.653 --> 00:24:56.619
All clear!

325
00:24:56.621 --> 00:24:58.421
Goddamn animals.

326
00:25:00.725 --> 00:25:02.025
Hey.

327
00:25:02.027 --> 00:25:03.092
Hey!

328
00:25:04.229 --> 00:25:05.662
Want some water?

329
00:25:05.664 --> 00:25:06.996
Wasser?

330
00:25:07.399 --> 00:25:08.398
Come here.

331
00:25:08.400 --> 00:25:09.732
How you doing, soldier?

332
00:25:09.734 --> 00:25:10.733
Some more?

333
00:25:10.735 --> 00:25:11.768
Aw, come on!

334
00:25:11.770 --> 00:25:13.670
Hey, want some more?

335
00:25:13.672 --> 00:25:14.904
It's all right.

336
00:25:15.841 --> 00:25:17.474
There you go.

337
00:25:23.715 --> 00:25:26.356
What the hell are
you doing, Private?


338
00:25:28.453 --> 00:25:29.819
Stand down!

339
00:25:29.821 --> 00:25:31.955
I said stand down!

340
00:25:38.330 --> 00:25:40.096
CK.

341
00:25:40.098 --> 00:25:41.564
Don't.

342
00:25:41.566 --> 00:25:42.632
Hey.

343
00:25:45.003 --> 00:25:46.069
Hey.

344
00:26:12.497 --> 00:26:13.563
Hey!

345
00:26:15.133 --> 00:26:18.134
I don't know how you did
things over in the Pacific.


346
00:26:18.136 --> 00:26:22.205
But over here, we don't butcher
helpless, unarmed soldiers,


347
00:26:22.207 --> 00:26:23.940
even if they're the enemy,

348
00:26:23.942 --> 00:26:25.842
before we've had
a chance to ask them


349
00:26:25.844 --> 00:26:27.877
some questions
and get some intel!


350
00:26:30.148 --> 00:26:34.083
We should have killed 'em all
when we had the chance.


351
00:26:34.085 --> 00:26:38.321
Think the kids might have
appreciated that?


352
00:26:38.323 --> 00:26:41.190
Or even our dear sweet Sister?

353
00:26:44.729 --> 00:26:46.396
Huh?

354
00:26:50.669 --> 00:26:51.901
Heh.

355
00:26:55.707 --> 00:26:58.274
Screw your head on
tight, soldier!


356
00:26:58.276 --> 00:27:01.244
Want to save
your goddamn kids or not?


357
00:27:14.993 --> 00:27:17.060
I told you to stay put.

358
00:27:22.801 --> 00:27:25.568
We have to go, Sister.

359
00:27:25.570 --> 00:27:27.904
We must bury them.

360
00:27:27.906 --> 00:27:30.373
There's no time
to bury the dead.


361
00:27:30.375 --> 00:27:31.474
I'm sorry.

362
00:27:35.246 --> 00:27:37.847
They're in God's hands now.

363
00:27:37.849 --> 00:27:40.016
Let's go save your kids.

364
00:28:00.171 --> 00:28:03.539
Major, what about
the Americans?


365
00:28:03.541 --> 00:28:06.576
They're most likely
an advance squad


366
00:28:06.578 --> 00:28:08.945
in preparation for their
up-and-coming operation.


367
00:28:08.947 --> 00:28:11.481
I want to capture
one of their commanders.


368
00:28:11.483 --> 00:28:14.217
I need to know what
their objectives are,


369
00:28:14.219 --> 00:28:17.220
how many men and when.

370
00:28:17.222 --> 00:28:19.722
We need more of our men,
Gretsch.


371
00:28:19.724 --> 00:28:24.694
It's been a long time since I've
had to travel this far on foot.


372
00:28:26.731 --> 00:28:29.198
Are you going weak
on me, Gretsch?


373
00:28:29.200 --> 00:28:30.733
Like the Fatherland?

374
00:28:33.705 --> 00:28:34.937
Like the Fatherland,

375
00:28:34.939 --> 00:28:37.273
are you turning weak on me?!

376
00:28:38.176 --> 00:28:41.110
In this time of crisis,

377
00:28:41.112 --> 00:28:44.180
we need all the
intelligence we can get!


378
00:28:44.182 --> 00:28:47.383
And if we need to walk,
we will walk!


379
00:28:47.385 --> 00:28:50.153
Unless you would care for
me to end the war for you


380
00:28:50.155 --> 00:28:51.254
right here, right now!

381
00:28:51.256 --> 00:28:54.757
You can sleep for the
rest of it and forever.


382
00:28:54.759 --> 00:28:56.392
Do you want that, Gretsch?

383
00:28:56.394 --> 00:28:58.561
No, Major.

384
00:28:59.998 --> 00:29:01.531
Good.

385
00:29:12.544 --> 00:29:13.643
It's one of ours.

386
00:29:15.080 --> 00:29:17.747
Are you going to help them?

387
00:29:22.987 --> 00:29:25.988
Sarge, CK and me
can get down there.


388
00:29:25.990 --> 00:29:27.590
Too far away. We can't.

389
00:29:27.592 --> 00:29:29.592
I know.

390
00:29:30.862 --> 00:29:33.663
It's our own guys!

391
00:29:39.637 --> 00:29:40.803
Sarge!

392
00:29:40.805 --> 00:29:41.871
It's over.

393
00:29:43.374 --> 00:29:44.707
Let's get those kids.

394
00:29:44.709 --> 00:29:46.075
Griffin...

395
00:29:47.612 --> 00:29:49.345
take point.

396
00:30:02.127 --> 00:30:04.227
Come on, Lance. 
Where are you?

397
00:30:06.297 --> 00:30:09.031
I don't think they're
gonna make it back.


398
00:30:09.033 --> 00:30:11.033
Sarge says we stay, we stay.

399
00:30:11.035 --> 00:30:12.769
Well, I say we go.

400
00:30:12.771 --> 00:30:14.612
What do you think, Gunderson?

401
00:30:15.774 --> 00:30:16.939
Heh.

402
00:30:16.941 --> 00:30:18.241
Thanks a lot for the support.

403
00:30:18.243 --> 00:30:20.343
We're not taking
a vote on this!


404
00:30:20.345 --> 00:30:22.979
The Sarge says we stay,
we stay.


405
00:30:22.981 --> 00:30:24.313
He's got an hour to get back.

406
00:30:24.315 --> 00:30:25.815
Why don't you
make yourself useful


407
00:30:25.817 --> 00:30:26.949
and do a perimeter check?

408
00:30:26.951 --> 00:30:28.851
Be back in an hour.

409
00:30:30.388 --> 00:30:31.687
Redeal.

410
00:31:00.051 --> 00:31:01.851
You are surrounded.

411
00:31:01.853 --> 00:31:03.152
Shit.

412
00:31:03.154 --> 00:31:05.555
Drop your rifle.

413
00:31:05.557 --> 00:31:07.290
Now.

414
00:31:42.093 --> 00:31:44.260
Good morning, Private.

415
00:31:44.262 --> 00:31:49.799
We need to have a talk about
your operations, hmm?


416
00:31:51.436 --> 00:31:53.135
Private Scott Sommers...

417
00:31:56.040 --> 00:31:58.207
Now...

418
00:32:01.880 --> 00:32:03.145
your up-and-coming operation,

419
00:32:03.147 --> 00:32:05.448
what's the objective?

420
00:32:06.251 --> 00:32:08.092
Private Scott S...

421
00:32:09.888 --> 00:32:14.857
Now, Private, how old are you?

422
00:32:14.859 --> 00:32:17.326
18? 19 perhaps?

423
00:32:17.328 --> 00:32:18.327
19?

424
00:32:18.329 --> 00:32:21.430
See?! We can communicate!

425
00:32:21.432 --> 00:32:24.367
Indeed, a young man.

426
00:32:24.369 --> 00:32:27.770
I've lost many young men,

427
00:32:27.772 --> 00:32:30.406
15-year-old boys,

428
00:32:30.408 --> 00:32:35.278
to soldiers just like you.

429
00:32:37.448 --> 00:32:40.783
You see, you will tell me

430
00:32:40.785 --> 00:32:45.554
everything you know
about your operations,


431
00:32:45.556 --> 00:32:50.426
or I will cut pieces
of you until you do.


432
00:32:54.432 --> 00:32:56.299
God!

433
00:32:56.301 --> 00:32:58.567
The operation,
what is your objective?


434
00:33:10.548 --> 00:33:11.814
Tell me!

435
00:33:25.229 --> 00:33:26.362
An hour and 10.

436
00:33:26.364 --> 00:33:28.030
Sommers has been gone too long.

437
00:33:28.032 --> 00:33:29.999
I need to go check on him.

438
00:33:31.836 --> 00:33:34.303
No, sir. Someone needs
to hold this tank,


439
00:33:34.305 --> 00:33:35.705
and that someone's you.

440
00:33:36.941 --> 00:33:38.240
Roger that.

441
00:33:38.242 --> 00:33:39.475
I'm going anyway.

442
00:33:49.153 --> 00:33:52.088
Uh, Freddy, we got a problem.

443
00:33:52.090 --> 00:33:54.023
What? You see something?

444
00:33:57.195 --> 00:33:58.661
Holy shit!

445
00:33:58.663 --> 00:34:01.030
They're not gonna miss
once they get that close!


446
00:34:01.032 --> 00:34:02.898
Gonna get an A.P.

447
00:34:02.900 --> 00:34:04.400
Get a good mark!

448
00:34:08.940 --> 00:34:10.172
Mark set!

449
00:34:10.541 --> 00:34:11.741
Fire!

450
00:34:31.396 --> 00:34:33.896
Okay, this mission's FUBAR.

451
00:34:33.898 --> 00:34:35.731
I don't even think
Kilroy's been here.


452
00:34:35.733 --> 00:34:37.653
We should talk
about this later.


453
00:35:05.763 --> 00:35:07.897
<i>Amerikaner!</i>

454
00:35:24.816 --> 00:35:27.483
How many grenades do we have?

455
00:35:27.485 --> 00:35:29.251
One! One!

456
00:35:29.253 --> 00:35:31.020
Light 'em up!

457
00:35:47.772 --> 00:35:51.507
Come on! Come on! Come on!
Move, move, move, move!


458
00:35:51.509 --> 00:35:53.542
All right, let's go! Come on!

459
00:36:04.856 --> 00:36:08.224
He was a member of an
American tank crew.


460
00:36:08.226 --> 00:36:10.493
They have their tank near here.

461
00:36:10.495 --> 00:36:13.329
Sadly, he did not
elaborate as to where.


462
00:36:13.331 --> 00:36:15.331
He knew nothing of their plans.

463
00:36:15.333 --> 00:36:16.866
Shall we find the tank?

464
00:36:16.868 --> 00:36:19.602
I don't give a damn
about their tank.


465
00:36:19.604 --> 00:36:21.704
I want the tank commander.

466
00:36:21.706 --> 00:36:25.207
And thank you to our
new found friend in there,


467
00:36:25.209 --> 00:36:26.742
our late friend,

468
00:36:26.744 --> 00:36:28.777
I know where they went.

469
00:36:47.832 --> 00:36:50.599
Doesn't look like
an orphanage to me.


470
00:37:25.136 --> 00:37:26.936
Oh, thank God.

471
00:37:42.420 --> 00:37:44.286
It's ours.

472
00:37:55.700 --> 00:37:56.865
Who here is in command?

473
00:37:56.867 --> 00:37:57.867
That would be me.

474
00:37:57.868 --> 00:37:59.268
And now it will be me.

475
00:37:59.270 --> 00:38:00.336
Turn this thing around.

476
00:38:00.338 --> 00:38:01.437
Everybody out!

477
00:38:03.040 --> 00:38:06.775
See, children? I told you your
mother would return safe.


478
00:38:06.777 --> 00:38:08.677
Mama! Mama! Mama! Mama!

479
00:38:08.679 --> 00:38:11.113
She's their mother?

480
00:38:12.583 --> 00:38:14.650
Let's talk.

481
00:38:29.934 --> 00:38:31.333
It's time for the truth.

482
00:38:32.603 --> 00:38:34.404
Those kids called you Mama.

483
00:38:34.705 --> 00:38:36.171
I am Sister Claudette.

484
00:38:36.173 --> 00:38:38.974
I don't think so.
You ain't French,


485
00:38:38.976 --> 00:38:40.542
and this ain't no orphanage.

486
00:38:40.544 --> 00:38:42.211
I think you're
a desperate mother


487
00:38:42.213 --> 00:38:44.813
who'd do anything
to save her kids,


488
00:38:44.815 --> 00:38:46.715
and you suckered us in here.

489
00:38:46.717 --> 00:38:48.384
I am not a nun.

490
00:38:48.386 --> 00:38:49.685
I am from Portugal.

491
00:38:49.687 --> 00:38:51.720
My husband was
an American ambassador,


492
00:38:51.722 --> 00:38:53.489
and we almost escaped.

493
00:38:53.491 --> 00:38:55.257
No more lies!

494
00:38:57.728 --> 00:39:00.462
And what about Sister
Mary what's-her-name?


495
00:39:00.464 --> 00:39:02.231
She is a real nun.

496
00:39:02.233 --> 00:39:03.465
Uh-huh.

497
00:39:03.467 --> 00:39:05.901
She has been our savior.

498
00:39:05.903 --> 00:39:09.071
And this, uh, orphanage?

499
00:39:09.073 --> 00:39:11.040
No orphans.

500
00:39:12.276 --> 00:39:14.510
I'm not gonna get my men
wrapped up in this matt...


501
00:39:14.512 --> 00:39:16.312
Get down!

502
00:39:18.482 --> 00:39:19.615
Rose, you see anything?

503
00:39:19.617 --> 00:39:21.050
Not yet!

504
00:39:21.052 --> 00:39:22.885
Pinned in a goddamn orphanage

505
00:39:22.887 --> 00:39:25.354
with goddamn nuns and kids.

506
00:39:26.557 --> 00:39:29.291
Private Griffin,
you okay out there?


507
00:39:29.293 --> 00:39:30.893
Fine, Sarge!

508
00:39:30.895 --> 00:39:32.394
Just enjoying the view!

509
00:39:34.532 --> 00:39:36.265
Coming your way!

510
00:39:38.936 --> 00:39:41.437
Grenade!

511
00:39:53.651 --> 00:39:57.052
Shh.
It's okay. It's okay.


512
00:39:58.289 --> 00:40:00.823
It's a hell of a time
to pull a John Wayne move,


513
00:40:00.825 --> 00:40:02.124
you stupid bastard!

514
00:40:02.126 --> 00:40:03.192
Shut up.

515
00:40:10.167 --> 00:40:12.501
There's no need for
any further bloodshed!


516
00:40:12.503 --> 00:40:16.205
Sounds like that Kraut officer
that killed those kids.


517
00:40:18.442 --> 00:40:19.942
Griff, can you move?

518
00:40:19.944 --> 00:40:22.411
I... Hurts pretty bad,
but I can move.


519
00:40:22.413 --> 00:40:23.512
Okay.

520
00:40:23.514 --> 00:40:26.682
If you surrender now,
I assure you


521
00:40:26.684 --> 00:40:30.652
that you will be treated in accordance
with the Geneva Convention!


522
00:40:30.654 --> 00:40:32.755
Oh, bullshit.

523
00:40:32.757 --> 00:40:36.091
Claudette, get the kids
ready to move now.


524
00:40:36.093 --> 00:40:39.128
I say we stand
and fight, Sarge!


525
00:40:39.130 --> 00:40:40.629
It's not your call, Private!

526
00:40:40.631 --> 00:40:42.464
If you are concerned

527
00:40:42.466 --> 00:40:44.299
for the lives of the children,

528
00:40:44.301 --> 00:40:47.836
I promise you they
will be treated well


529
00:40:47.838 --> 00:40:51.607
if you come out now
and surrender!


530
00:40:51.609 --> 00:40:52.708
We're wasting time.

531
00:40:52.710 --> 00:40:53.976
CK, damn it.

532
00:40:53.978 --> 00:40:55.244
That's enough, soldier.

533
00:40:55.246 --> 00:40:56.445
It's not too long

534
00:40:56.447 --> 00:40:59.047
till the operation's bombs
start falling.


535
00:41:00.785 --> 00:41:02.618
<i>Grenaden.</i>

536
00:41:02.620 --> 00:41:03.852
<i>Schnell!</i>

537
00:41:10.761 --> 00:41:11.794
Pierre! Pierre!

538
00:41:11.796 --> 00:41:13.996
Stop! Stop!

539
00:41:16.901 --> 00:41:19.268
Stay with Amelie.
I will protect Pierre.


540
00:41:20.938 --> 00:41:22.838
Nuts. Claudette,
you and Sister Mary


541
00:41:22.840 --> 00:41:24.740
get those kids ready to go now!

542
00:41:24.742 --> 00:41:26.742
Okay.

543
00:41:26.744 --> 00:41:29.278
CK, you go with those kids!

544
00:41:29.280 --> 00:41:30.846
Pierre has run away!

545
00:41:30.848 --> 00:41:33.482
Aw, come on! You
gotta be kidding me!


546
00:41:33.484 --> 00:41:35.117
Do it!

547
00:41:37.688 --> 00:41:38.987
All right, let's go!

548
00:41:40.090 --> 00:41:41.156
Come on. Let's go!

549
00:41:41.158 --> 00:41:42.891
Move, move, move!

550
00:41:43.527 --> 00:41:45.561
Move, move, move, move!

551
00:41:45.563 --> 00:41:46.562
Come on.

552
00:41:46.564 --> 00:41:48.263
Pierre!

553
00:41:48.265 --> 00:41:49.905
Come on! 
- Pierre!

554
00:41:50.634 --> 00:41:52.334
Pierre!

555
00:41:52.336 --> 00:41:53.602
Sarge, Griffin's been hit!

556
00:41:53.604 --> 00:41:55.103
Come on! Come on!

557
00:41:55.105 --> 00:41:56.171
Ahh!

558
00:42:06.584 --> 00:42:08.951
Pi...

559
00:42:16.594 --> 00:42:19.061
Pierre! Pierre!

560
00:42:19.063 --> 00:42:20.562
Pierre! Pierre!

561
00:42:25.069 --> 00:42:26.435
Shut up. Shut up, lady!

562
00:42:26.437 --> 00:42:28.003
The Krauts are gonna hear you.

563
00:42:28.005 --> 00:42:30.138
Pierre went in the woods.

564
00:42:30.140 --> 00:42:32.407
Stop him, please. Find him!

565
00:42:33.377 --> 00:42:35.210
H
-He's just a boy.

566
00:42:35.212 --> 00:42:36.712
He's just a boy!

567
00:42:36.714 --> 00:42:38.814
Oh, Pierre!

568
00:42:38.816 --> 00:42:40.749
Oh, God, Pierre.

569
00:42:40.751 --> 00:42:41.850
God in Heaven.

570
00:42:41.852 --> 00:42:42.918
Pierre. Ohh.

571
00:42:44.722 --> 00:42:45.721
CK!

572
00:42:45.723 --> 00:42:47.623
CK, get your ass back here now!

573
00:42:47.625 --> 00:42:48.657
I could follow him!

574
00:42:48.659 --> 00:42:49.925
Negative! We gotta go!

575
00:42:49.927 --> 00:42:52.160
CK knows where
the tank is, all right?


576
00:42:52.162 --> 00:42:54.429
He'll have to catch up.
You get Griffin,


577
00:42:54.431 --> 00:42:56.365
and you follow me, all right?

578
00:42:56.367 --> 00:42:58.567
Pierre! 
- Shhh.

579
00:42:58.569 --> 00:43:00.602
Sister, listen.

580
00:43:00.604 --> 00:43:03.238
We can't run fast
enough, all right?


581
00:43:03.240 --> 00:43:05.173
CK will find the boy.

582
00:43:07.778 --> 00:43:09.111
He'll save your son.

583
00:43:09.113 --> 00:43:11.113
I promise.

584
00:43:12.449 --> 00:43:13.482
Gotta go. 
- Go.

585
00:43:13.484 --> 00:43:14.483
Move, move, move, move, move!

586
00:43:14.485 --> 00:43:15.651
Let's go. 
- Go, go.

587
00:43:15.653 --> 00:43:16.752
Move, move, move, move!

588
00:43:16.754 --> 00:43:17.986
Move. Move. Come on.

589
00:43:17.988 --> 00:43:20.088
Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.

590
00:43:38.542 --> 00:43:40.622
Kid, what the hell's
the matter with you?


591
00:44:08.539 --> 00:44:11.173
Come on now, kid.

592
00:44:11.175 --> 00:44:12.741
Come on now. Hey...

593
00:44:12.743 --> 00:44:15.243
there's no need
for that, all right?


594
00:44:34.665 --> 00:44:36.198
Oh, no, no.

595
00:44:36.200 --> 00:44:37.733
Come on.

596
00:44:39.136 --> 00:44:41.403
Ah, stupid!

597
00:44:59.690 --> 00:45:01.957
We will find Pierre soon, okay.

598
00:45:08.165 --> 00:45:09.698
Damn. 
- Sir! Sir!

599
00:45:09.700 --> 00:45:11.099
I'm fine, Sergeant!

600
00:45:11.101 --> 00:45:14.136
I'm fine. Just...
Just a minor misstep.


601
00:45:14.138 --> 00:45:16.672
Let's take a minute
and catch our breath.


602
00:45:16.674 --> 00:45:20.342
Said... I said I'm fine.

603
00:45:28.619 --> 00:45:30.786
We're a few clicks
east of the tank.


604
00:45:30.788 --> 00:45:32.454
CK... 
- Will be fine,

605
00:45:32.456 --> 00:45:33.822
or they won't.

606
00:45:33.824 --> 00:45:36.658
We've got a bigger
immediate problem.


607
00:45:36.660 --> 00:45:38.260
Griffin's not doing well.

608
00:45:38.262 --> 00:45:40.495
Right. We don't have the time

609
00:45:40.497 --> 00:45:42.338
or the manpower to go back.

610
00:45:47.438 --> 00:45:50.205
CK and the boy.

611
00:45:53.243 --> 00:45:54.376
It's not good.

612
00:46:06.590 --> 00:46:07.656
No.

613
00:46:07.658 --> 00:46:08.523
No.

614
00:46:08.525 --> 00:46:10.459
No.

615
00:46:10.461 --> 00:46:12.627
No. No.

616
00:46:12.629 --> 00:46:14.563
No! No! No!

617
00:46:14.565 --> 00:46:15.597
Oh, God.

618
00:46:15.599 --> 00:46:18.533
Oh, God.

619
00:46:21.138 --> 00:46:23.638
No. No.

620
00:46:23.640 --> 00:46:24.773
No.

621
00:46:24.775 --> 00:46:27.075
My baby. No.

622
00:46:29.313 --> 00:46:31.947
No.

623
00:46:33.050 --> 00:46:34.116
No.

624
00:46:35.719 --> 00:46:37.085
No.

625
00:46:39.223 --> 00:46:40.288
Where were you?

626
00:46:41.759 --> 00:46:43.358
Where were you?!

627
00:46:44.328 --> 00:46:45.894
Where were you?!

628
00:46:45.896 --> 00:46:47.863
Where were you?!

629
00:46:51.635 --> 00:46:53.635
Claudette, quiet.

630
00:46:53.637 --> 00:46:55.103
Sarge...

631
00:46:55.105 --> 00:46:57.072
She's quiet, or we're dead.

632
00:47:00.844 --> 00:47:03.044
My baby!

633
00:47:03.046 --> 00:47:04.112
Shh.

634
00:47:13.157 --> 00:47:14.222
Private...

635
00:47:19.429 --> 00:47:20.495
German bullet.

636
00:47:22.065 --> 00:47:24.166
I let my guard down.

637
00:47:26.570 --> 00:47:28.904
Rose, you and Griffin get them.

638
00:47:28.906 --> 00:47:30.405
Get out of here.

639
00:47:32.075 --> 00:47:34.955
Come on. Come on. Come on.
Come on. We gotta go.


640
00:47:44.321 --> 00:47:47.022
We're gonna have to bury
the kid shallow.


641
00:47:55.232 --> 00:47:57.465
That should have been for me.

642
00:47:58.836 --> 00:48:01.036
That kid just... He just...

643
00:48:01.038 --> 00:48:04.606
Let's just get this kid
buried quickly.


644
00:48:13.917 --> 00:48:15.784
A.P. loaded! Up!

645
00:48:15.786 --> 00:48:17.385
Fire!

646
00:48:23.861 --> 00:48:26.161
Yeah! Yeah!

647
00:48:26.163 --> 00:48:28.496
Ha!

648
00:48:30.434 --> 00:48:31.900
Reloading!

649
00:48:31.902 --> 00:48:33.568
Load it up! Quick!

650
00:48:41.979 --> 00:48:45.247
Do those help, Sister?

651
00:48:45.249 --> 00:48:48.216
Heh. I never been much
for religion.


652
00:48:48.218 --> 00:48:52.120
Starting to figure maybe I
should start thinking about it.


653
00:48:56.693 --> 00:48:58.193
Thank you.

654
00:48:58.195 --> 00:48:59.261
<i>Merci.</i>

655
00:49:00.731 --> 00:49:02.430
Mercy?

656
00:49:02.432 --> 00:49:03.431
<i>Merci.</i>

657
00:49:03.433 --> 00:49:04.432
Uh...

658
00:49:04.434 --> 00:49:05.467
thank you.

659
00:49:05.469 --> 00:49:06.835
<i>Merci.</i> 
- Oh.

660
00:49:06.837 --> 00:49:08.336
Heh heh ho ho ho.

661
00:49:08.338 --> 00:49:10.171
<i>Merci.</i>

662
00:49:12.509 --> 00:49:17.045
Hey, CK, looks like I
finally got one thing right


663
00:49:17.047 --> 00:49:19.547
in my sorry-ass G.I. life.

664
00:49:29.326 --> 00:49:32.794
Doesn't seem like a
necessary firefight, Sarge.


665
00:49:32.796 --> 00:49:33.995
Let's find another route.

666
00:49:33.997 --> 00:49:35.630
We have to get to the tank.

667
00:49:35.632 --> 00:49:37.198
This is the quickest route.

668
00:49:37.200 --> 00:49:40.302
None of us are in a position
to fight right now.


669
00:49:40.304 --> 00:49:41.369
We could find
another way around.


670
00:49:41.371 --> 00:49:43.104
Might take a little
longer, but...


671
00:49:43.106 --> 00:49:44.139
How much longer?

672
00:49:44.141 --> 00:49:45.807
About 20 minutes.

673
00:49:45.809 --> 00:49:48.043
That's time we don't have.

674
00:49:48.045 --> 00:49:50.045
That's time
Griffin doesn't have.


675
00:49:50.047 --> 00:49:52.514
CK, you get Griffin
and the civilians.


676
00:49:52.516 --> 00:49:55.116
Take 'em about 20 meters
in the woods.


677
00:49:55.118 --> 00:49:57.018
You hide 'em as best you can.

678
00:49:57.020 --> 00:49:59.154
Then you get your ass
back here ASAP.


679
00:49:59.156 --> 00:50:00.322
He's right, Sarge.

680
00:50:00.324 --> 00:50:02.023
We got no chance of
making it through.


681
00:50:02.025 --> 00:50:03.158
Let me draw fire.

682
00:50:03.160 --> 00:50:04.793
You guys get the
civilians through.


683
00:50:04.795 --> 00:50:08.730
Griffin, I am not sending a
wounded man out to get cut down.


684
00:50:08.732 --> 00:50:10.332
It's for the best, Sarge.

685
00:50:10.334 --> 00:50:11.967
Griff, you been losing
a lot of blood.


686
00:50:11.969 --> 00:50:13.929
You don't know
what you're saying.


687
00:50:14.604 --> 00:50:15.904
It's the only way,

688
00:50:15.906 --> 00:50:17.272
and you know it.
You all know it.


689
00:50:17.274 --> 00:50:21.276
No. We stick to my plan,

690
00:50:21.278 --> 00:50:24.412
and you go
on my signal. Move out.


691
00:50:25.349 --> 00:50:27.215
All right,
let's go. Come on.


692
00:50:27.217 --> 00:50:29.551
Come on. Griff, you're with me.

693
00:50:34.257 --> 00:50:36.591
Griff, let's go.

694
00:50:54.144 --> 00:50:56.311
All right.

695
00:50:56.313 --> 00:50:58.780
Hey, keep your eyes open.

696
00:51:00.150 --> 00:51:02.317
I gotta go for a bit.

697
00:51:02.319 --> 00:51:04.552
Buddy, I need you
to keep breathing.


698
00:51:04.554 --> 00:51:05.787
All right?

699
00:51:05.789 --> 00:51:07.188
Now hey. Hey.

700
00:51:07.190 --> 00:51:09.424
All right, now you
see a Kraut helmet,


701
00:51:09.426 --> 00:51:11.393
you just start
shooting, all right?


702
00:51:11.395 --> 00:51:13.261
All right.

703
00:51:14.531 --> 00:51:15.563
All right. Yeah.

704
00:51:15.565 --> 00:51:18.466
Hey, CK? 
- Yeah?

705
00:51:18.468 --> 00:51:21.269
Get the hell out of here.

706
00:51:21.271 --> 00:51:23.772
Can't you see I got
civilians to save?


707
00:51:23.774 --> 00:51:26.474
You Okie son of a bitch.

708
00:51:27.477 --> 00:51:29.911
All right,
you wait here for me.


709
00:51:29.913 --> 00:51:31.646
You copy me?

710
00:51:33.784 --> 00:51:35.717
FIGMO.

711
00:51:37.554 --> 00:51:40.789
I copy, man. I copy.

712
00:51:45.862 --> 00:51:48.430
You stay here.

713
00:51:58.041 --> 00:51:59.374
Wait here.

714
00:52:11.288 --> 00:52:15.223
It's okay,
Amelie. It's okay.


715
00:52:15.225 --> 00:52:17.125
Just look at the lights

716
00:52:17.127 --> 00:52:19.961
playing through the trees.

717
00:52:19.963 --> 00:52:22.330
Look how beautiful they are.

718
00:52:30.173 --> 00:52:32.407
The hell with this.

719
00:52:44.087 --> 00:52:45.920
Monsieur.

720
00:52:59.703 --> 00:53:01.069
Damn it.

721
00:53:02.973 --> 00:53:04.639
Get the civilians.

722
00:53:06.910 --> 00:53:07.942
That was Griffin.

723
00:53:07.944 --> 00:53:09.410
Yeah.

724
00:53:10.680 --> 00:53:13.148
All right, let's go. Come on.

725
00:53:13.150 --> 00:53:15.070
Come on. Let's go.
On the double.


726
00:53:17.020 --> 00:53:18.653
Griff.

727
00:53:18.655 --> 00:53:20.355
Griff.

728
00:53:26.096 --> 00:53:28.363
Griff ain't there, Sarge.

729
00:53:28.365 --> 00:53:30.798
Gotta get
to that tank, soldier.


730
00:53:32.669 --> 00:53:34.669
That's him, Sarge.
We gotta back him up.


731
00:53:34.671 --> 00:53:36.271
He's saving our ass right now.

732
00:53:36.273 --> 00:53:38.239
Let's not let that go to waste.

733
00:53:38.241 --> 00:53:39.474
Let's move.

734
00:53:56.359 --> 00:53:58.426
<i>Amerikaner! Amerikaner!</i>
<i>Amerikaner!</i>


735
00:54:00.363 --> 00:54:02.363
<i>Ha??nde hoch!</i>

736
00:54:02.365 --> 00:54:04.299
<i>Ha??nde hoch, 
Amerikaner!</i>

737
00:54:04.301 --> 00:54:06.634
Well, what do you know, Sarge?

738
00:54:06.636 --> 00:54:09.837
Looks like I had
one extra after all.


739
00:54:30.827 --> 00:54:33.127
The operation's breathing
down our backside, Gunderson.


740
00:54:33.129 --> 00:54:35.129
Only one real round
left, Freddy.


741
00:54:36.566 --> 00:54:39.267
I don't like the sound of that.

742
00:54:52.749 --> 00:54:54.616
You finally get to use Stella.

743
00:54:54.618 --> 00:54:55.984
Load her up.

744
00:54:59.889 --> 00:55:00.955
Run like hell.

745
00:55:15.405 --> 00:55:17.839
Gunderson, back inside now!

746
00:55:35.959 --> 00:55:39.327
Hey, let's take a minute
and switch off.


747
00:55:39.329 --> 00:55:42.196
Rose, stand guard.

748
00:55:42.198 --> 00:55:44.632
CK, with me.

749
00:55:45.568 --> 00:55:47.302
Thank you, Sergeant.

750
00:55:47.304 --> 00:55:49.105
My daughter needs a rest.

751
00:55:50.240 --> 00:55:51.920
Get down. Get down.

752
00:55:56.913 --> 00:55:59.447
On the double, soldier.

753
00:56:05.422 --> 00:56:07.622
Are you on board
with the mission at hand?


754
00:56:08.958 --> 00:56:12.093
I'm sorry Griffin and that
kid died, I really am,


755
00:56:12.095 --> 00:56:13.895
and I need you
thinking straight.


756
00:56:13.897 --> 00:56:14.896
Do your duty.

757
00:56:14.898 --> 00:56:15.997
Griffin did his duty.

758
00:56:15.999 --> 00:56:17.098
This kid is safe.

759
00:56:18.468 --> 00:56:21.402
We're done, hmm? Sir?

760
00:56:21.404 --> 00:56:22.937
Don't call me sir!

761
00:56:22.939 --> 00:56:24.539
I work for a living.

762
00:56:24.541 --> 00:56:25.873
You need to get
your shit together,


763
00:56:25.875 --> 00:56:27.742
because you are
compromising my team.


764
00:56:27.744 --> 00:56:29.944
We should have been at the
rallying point an hour ago,


765
00:56:29.946 --> 00:56:32.113
but we ain't, 'cause of them.

766
00:56:32.115 --> 00:56:34.115
They're the compromise.

767
00:56:34.117 --> 00:56:36.851
We are soldiers!
That is our job!


768
00:56:36.853 --> 00:56:38.653
That what you're gonna tell
yourself when you're thinking


769
00:56:38.655 --> 00:56:40.188
about killing Griffin
and this whole team?


770
00:56:40.190 --> 00:56:42.090
Listen here,
you son of a bitch!


771
00:56:42.092 --> 00:56:44.525
Yeah! Yeah! 
- Leave it be!

772
00:56:44.527 --> 00:56:46.527
Clock's a'tickin'!

773
00:56:48.832 --> 00:56:51.065
We need to get moving now.

774
00:56:51.067 --> 00:56:54.068
CK, on point.

775
00:56:54.070 --> 00:56:55.570
Yes, sir.

776
00:57:11.521 --> 00:57:15.323
There are many tracks on
the road, and now this.


777
00:57:15.325 --> 00:57:18.126
They're still nearby,
Herr Gretsch.


778
00:57:18.128 --> 00:57:19.260
Major?

779
00:57:19.262 --> 00:57:20.895
We are looking...

780
00:57:23.266 --> 00:57:24.832
for an American G.I.,

781
00:57:24.834 --> 00:57:28.069
a woman and some children.

782
00:57:29.973 --> 00:57:31.539
Our lines are nearby.

783
00:57:31.541 --> 00:57:34.542
We can use some more help.

784
00:57:34.544 --> 00:57:36.844
<i>Ja,</i> Major.

785
00:57:57.600 --> 00:57:59.767
Y'all have to come see this.

786
00:57:59.769 --> 00:58:02.970
Some kind of Nazi scarecrow.

787
00:58:02.972 --> 00:58:04.772
Check it out.

788
00:58:30.233 --> 00:58:31.432
Sniper in the woods!

789
00:58:31.434 --> 00:58:33.234
You are one lucky
son of a bitch.


790
00:58:33.236 --> 00:58:34.902
Tell me about it.

791
00:58:34.904 --> 00:58:37.824
Rose, get up here, and get
me eyes on that shooter!


792
00:58:42.278 --> 00:58:43.611
You see him?

793
00:58:45.615 --> 00:58:48.415
A couple yards to the
right of that scarecrow!


794
00:58:50.186 --> 00:58:52.720
Ain't wearing a uniform.

795
00:58:52.722 --> 00:58:54.388
There are poachers
in these woods.


796
00:58:54.390 --> 00:58:55.723
They will shoot either side.

797
00:58:55.725 --> 00:58:58.125
They do not care
where a bounty is from.


798
00:58:58.127 --> 00:58:59.160
Think I see him.

799
00:58:59.162 --> 00:59:01.496
Got a shot?

800
00:59:07.437 --> 00:59:08.703
All right, we're
gonna have to...


801
00:59:08.705 --> 00:59:10.338
gonna have to go
around this field,


802
00:59:10.340 --> 00:59:11.372
use those trees for cover.

803
00:59:11.374 --> 00:59:12.607
It's gonna cost us.

804
00:59:12.609 --> 00:59:15.910
That tank'll be
a sight for sore eyes.


805
00:59:17.347 --> 00:59:19.213
A.P. loaded! Up!

806
00:59:19.215 --> 00:59:20.314
Fire!

807
00:59:23.419 --> 00:59:24.619
Yeah! Yeah!

808
00:59:33.663 --> 00:59:35.630
Come on, Sarge. Hurry up.

809
00:59:37.066 --> 00:59:39.700
CK, you remember Omaha?

810
00:59:39.702 --> 00:59:43.104
Man, I never thought I'd
have to do another Omaha.


811
00:59:43.106 --> 00:59:44.972
You're gonna do an Omaha!

812
00:59:46.109 --> 00:59:47.108
With gravy?

813
00:59:47.110 --> 00:59:50.845
No gravy!
We're out in the open.


814
01:00:23.813 --> 01:00:24.452
- Freeze!
- Freeze!
- Freeze!


815
01:00:24.814 --> 01:00:27.348
- Freeze!
- Freeze!
- Hold it!


816
01:00:27.350 --> 01:00:28.349
Ah, hell. I know that sound!

817
01:00:28.351 --> 01:00:30.351
Who was it? Which one? Who?

818
01:00:33.122 --> 01:00:34.188
Go.

819
01:00:34.190 --> 01:00:36.757
Take her. Be safe.

820
01:00:36.759 --> 01:00:38.326
Stop! Stop! Stop!

821
01:00:38.328 --> 01:00:39.627
Stop! Stop! Stop!

822
01:00:39.629 --> 01:00:40.928
All right, do not move!

823
01:00:40.930 --> 01:00:42.530
Don't move. What are you doing?

824
01:00:42.532 --> 01:00:44.599
No! Do not move! Don't!

825
01:00:44.601 --> 01:00:46.100
Stop! Stop! All right.

826
01:00:46.102 --> 01:00:47.768
All right,
you're gonna do that.


827
01:00:47.770 --> 01:00:49.704
You're gonna walk right to me.

828
01:00:57.914 --> 01:00:58.913
Take it slow honey.

829
01:00:58.915 --> 01:01:00.514
- Slow down. - Go to CK.
- Don't move.


830
01:01:00.516 --> 01:01:02.516
All right. Slow down. Easy.

831
01:01:02.518 --> 01:01:03.517
Slow down.

832
01:01:07.657 --> 01:01:09.223
Stay calm.

833
01:01:09.225 --> 01:01:11.125
God be with you.

834
01:01:15.965 --> 01:01:18.466
All right, take small steps.
Just right here.


835
01:01:18.468 --> 01:01:20.234
Now, when you get here,

836
01:01:20.236 --> 01:01:23.156
you're just gonna hand her
right over to me, okay?


837
01:01:27.143 --> 01:01:29.577
I'm right here. Right here.

838
01:01:29.579 --> 01:01:31.012
I'm gonna take her from you.

839
01:01:31.014 --> 01:01:33.280
Just slow down. Slow down.
Nice and easy.


840
01:01:33.282 --> 01:01:34.448
Nice and easy now.

841
01:01:34.450 --> 01:01:35.850
All right,
I got her! I got her!


842
01:01:35.852 --> 01:01:37.985
Oh, God.

843
01:01:38.955 --> 01:01:40.855
What the hell are you doing?

844
01:01:40.857 --> 01:01:44.859
I'm getting my way into
Heaven by saving a nun.


845
01:01:44.861 --> 01:01:46.761
We both know
that's a mine out there.


846
01:01:46.763 --> 01:01:49.296
Hey, can't let you do that.

847
01:01:49.298 --> 01:01:51.065
The hell you can't.

848
01:01:51.067 --> 01:01:53.534
Lance, take care of the kid.

849
01:01:53.536 --> 01:01:55.636
Maybe it was just a dud.

850
01:01:55.638 --> 01:01:58.339
Maybe I can still get her off.

851
01:01:58.341 --> 01:01:59.440
Nathan! Look...

852
01:01:59.442 --> 01:02:00.641
Good.

853
01:02:00.643 --> 01:02:02.510
It's settled.

854
01:02:08.885 --> 01:02:12.920
I'm so afraid, so very afraid.

855
01:02:13.690 --> 01:02:15.356
Be strong, Mother Mary!

856
01:02:15.358 --> 01:02:21.429
I wasn't expecting to be
visiting our Father so soon.


857
01:02:21.431 --> 01:02:23.130
Oh, Mother.

858
01:02:33.409 --> 01:02:34.909
We gotta go.

859
01:02:34.911 --> 01:02:37.545
We gotta get
to a safe distance.


860
01:02:37.547 --> 01:02:38.612
Move, Sister! CK: All right.

861
01:02:38.614 --> 01:02:39.613
No! Come on.

862
01:02:39.615 --> 01:02:40.614
Move! 
- No!

863
01:02:40.616 --> 01:02:42.177
Come on. 
- No!

864
01:02:43.519 --> 01:02:47.488
You know, normally, Sister,

865
01:02:47.490 --> 01:02:49.290
I'm not a praying man.

866
01:02:49.292 --> 01:02:52.960
I promise you I'll do
my best for you.


867
01:02:55.531 --> 01:02:58.432
I seem to remember

868
01:02:58.434 --> 01:03:01.268
my... my Catholic friends.

869
01:03:06.743 --> 01:03:07.908
It's a prayer.

870
01:03:09.712 --> 01:03:13.814
Hail Mary, full of Grace.

871
01:03:18.354 --> 01:03:20.988
Bless you, my son.

872
01:03:22.692 --> 01:03:24.391
Heh.

873
01:03:36.973 --> 01:03:38.038
Amelie, come back!

874
01:03:38.040 --> 01:03:39.920
Sarge, we got a problem here!

875
01:03:43.479 --> 01:03:45.546
He's gone, Sarge!

876
01:03:45.548 --> 01:03:46.781
Amelie.

877
01:03:46.783 --> 01:03:48.349
Baby.

878
01:03:59.428 --> 01:04:02.229
Amelie!

879
01:04:02.231 --> 01:04:03.430
Amelie! Ohh!

880
01:04:03.432 --> 01:04:04.498
Where are you?

881
01:04:04.500 --> 01:04:05.566
Oh, Amelie.

882
01:04:10.573 --> 01:04:12.640
Amelie!

883
01:04:12.642 --> 01:04:13.974
Amelie!

884
01:04:15.545 --> 01:04:17.211
Amelie!

885
01:04:17.213 --> 01:04:18.279
Amelie!

886
01:04:23.386 --> 01:04:25.119
Halt!

887
01:04:33.396 --> 01:04:35.529
<i>Raus! Raus!</i>

888
01:04:39.368 --> 01:04:40.868
Amelie!

889
01:04:40.870 --> 01:04:42.069
Amelie!

890
01:04:43.539 --> 01:04:45.372
Amelie!

891
01:04:45.374 --> 01:04:46.507
Amelie!

892
01:05:27.350 --> 01:05:29.917
American commander!

893
01:05:29.919 --> 01:05:32.553
I have something you want!

894
01:05:43.666 --> 01:05:46.200
American commander!

895
01:05:46.969 --> 01:05:49.737
I know you are out there!

896
01:05:49.739 --> 01:05:51.639
Sarge, he's gonna do it. You know.
You saw what he did back there.


897
01:05:51.641 --> 01:05:53.361
Yeah, I know.

898
01:05:58.414 --> 01:06:00.881
I propose a trade!

899
01:06:04.720 --> 01:06:06.553
Come on now! We have
no time to waste!


900
01:06:07.356 --> 01:06:08.355
No.

901
01:06:08.357 --> 01:06:09.924
We've already lost
one kid today.


902
01:06:09.926 --> 01:06:11.992
Let's not lose another one.

903
01:06:18.834 --> 01:06:21.669
You hear this?

904
01:06:21.671 --> 01:06:23.637
These are my men,

905
01:06:23.639 --> 01:06:25.572
and they are closing in!

906
01:06:25.574 --> 01:06:28.776
It would be a shame if I
had to kill these people


907
01:06:28.778 --> 01:06:31.712
so you could go on
playing soldier!


908
01:06:33.549 --> 01:06:36.183
The clock is ticking!

909
01:06:36.919 --> 01:06:39.620
Ticktock!

910
01:06:39.622 --> 01:06:41.221
Show yourself!

911
01:06:48.864 --> 01:06:51.065
Let her and the kid go.

912
01:06:55.705 --> 01:06:57.371
You are alone?

913
01:06:59.642 --> 01:07:00.708
Yes.

914
01:07:22.698 --> 01:07:25.032
Are you, now?

915
01:07:25.034 --> 01:07:27.001
So...

916
01:07:27.003 --> 01:07:28.335
you're a liar.

917
01:07:35.244 --> 01:07:38.579
How could I possibly
keep my word to a liar?


918
01:07:47.790 --> 01:07:49.123
Don't touch her!

919
01:07:55.865 --> 01:07:59.566
I'll kick your teeth through
the back of your neck!


920
01:08:06.175 --> 01:08:07.441
Greetings, Sergeant.

921
01:08:20.356 --> 01:08:23.323
We need to talk about
your upcoming operation.


922
01:08:25.895 --> 01:08:28.829
Staff Sergeant Lance Dawson,
United States Army.


923
01:08:28.831 --> 01:08:32.566
Serial number DL3268.

924
01:08:35.237 --> 01:08:37.171
Yes, you are.

925
01:08:40.576 --> 01:08:44.878
Earlier today, I met one
of your young privates.


926
01:08:44.880 --> 01:08:46.613
Tank soldier.

927
01:08:46.615 --> 01:08:49.516
Didn't know much
about your plans.


928
01:08:50.553 --> 01:08:52.433
He did tell me what he knew...

929
01:08:53.055 --> 01:08:55.355
eventually.

930
01:08:56.592 --> 01:08:58.659
But you,

931
01:08:58.661 --> 01:09:00.360
you are a commander.

932
01:09:01.697 --> 01:09:03.263
You know all your plans,

933
01:09:03.265 --> 01:09:07.434
and you will tell me
everything I need to know.


934
01:09:07.436 --> 01:09:09.970
Staff Sergeant Lance Dawson,

935
01:09:09.972 --> 01:09:11.171
United States Army. Shh.

936
01:09:11.173 --> 01:09:15.709
You... 
- Serial number DL3268.

937
01:09:16.979 --> 01:09:18.820
This means something to you.

938
01:09:19.715 --> 01:09:21.782
Your father's,
grandfather, family?


939
01:09:21.784 --> 01:09:23.851
Hmm?

940
01:09:23.853 --> 01:09:25.686
It's very nice.

941
01:09:27.456 --> 01:09:32.926
Sergeant, you will tell me
everything I need to know,


942
01:09:32.928 --> 01:09:34.128
sooner or later.

943
01:09:35.164 --> 01:09:36.763
Staff Sergeant Lance Dawson,

944
01:09:36.765 --> 01:09:38.065
United States Army. Ohh.

945
01:09:38.067 --> 01:09:40.534
Stop that. Serial number DL...

946
01:09:42.404 --> 01:09:43.504
Gretsch!

947
01:09:51.480 --> 01:09:53.981
Now you're going to tell
me about your plans.


948
01:09:53.983 --> 01:09:55.582
Staff Sergeant Lance Dawson...
We need to know units.


949
01:09:55.584 --> 01:09:56.917
United States Army.
- I want to know.


950
01:09:56.919 --> 01:09:58.552
I want places.
I want numbers...


951
01:09:58.554 --> 01:10:01.922
Serial number DL326...
- An objective...


952
01:10:04.326 --> 01:10:07.461
You are not telling me
what I want to know!


953
01:10:13.736 --> 01:10:17.638
Service number 375...

954
01:10:18.374 --> 01:10:19.506
Idiot!

955
01:10:19.508 --> 01:10:21.375
Aah!

956
01:10:25.314 --> 01:10:28.382
Gretsch! Stop playing.

957
01:10:28.384 --> 01:10:30.250
The American passed out.

958
01:10:30.252 --> 01:10:31.652
Bring me this one.

959
01:10:31.654 --> 01:10:33.053
<i>Ja,</i> Major.

960
01:10:33.055 --> 01:10:35.956
And these two in 10 minutes.

961
01:10:35.958 --> 01:10:38.225
Going to clean up.

962
01:10:38.227 --> 01:10:39.927
<i>Ja,</i> Major.

963
01:10:49.638 --> 01:10:50.771
Leave them alone.

964
01:10:55.177 --> 01:10:57.911
You smell pretty, Fr?ulein.

965
01:10:57.913 --> 01:10:59.873
Leave them out of it,
you coward.


966
01:11:08.090 --> 01:11:10.390
Gretsch, now!

967
01:11:14.496 --> 01:11:16.597
<i>Schnell!</i>

968
01:11:16.599 --> 01:11:17.664
<i>Schnell!</i>

969
01:11:26.575 --> 01:11:27.841
Jesus!

970
01:11:27.843 --> 01:11:29.343
He needs water!

971
01:11:30.946 --> 01:11:32.045
Sarge.

972
01:11:32.047 --> 01:11:33.580
You don't look so good.
- Get back!


973
01:11:33.582 --> 01:11:36.383
You look like you could
use some mashed potatoes.


974
01:11:36.385 --> 01:11:38.151
With gravy.

975
01:11:38.153 --> 01:11:39.953
Yeah.

976
01:12:07.049 --> 01:12:09.583
I am glad to see you.

977
01:12:09.585 --> 01:12:12.419
Yeah. Sorry about that, boss.

978
01:12:36.478 --> 01:12:38.679
Hey, you know how
to drive this thing?


979
01:12:38.681 --> 01:12:41.448
Sergeant Rose taught me
everything I know about driving,


980
01:12:41.450 --> 01:12:42.582
so yeah. All right.

981
01:12:42.584 --> 01:12:44.551
All right.

982
01:12:44.553 --> 01:12:47.220
Now, how do I start this thing?

983
01:12:52.428 --> 01:12:54.895
<i>Scheisse.</i>

984
01:13:02.771 --> 01:13:05.138
Bring me mein Panzer!
- Schnell!


985
01:13:05.140 --> 01:13:06.740
We'll take the shortcut.

986
01:13:19.355 --> 01:13:21.621
Where... Where are we going?

987
01:13:21.623 --> 01:13:23.890
As far away from here
as we can get,


988
01:13:23.892 --> 01:13:25.659
toward American lines.

989
01:13:25.661 --> 01:13:28.195
We have to get out of here before
these bombs start falling.


990
01:13:39.007 --> 01:13:40.807
<i>Schnell! Schnell!</i>

991
01:14:10.439 --> 01:14:11.872
Shit.

992
01:14:11.874 --> 01:14:13.173
God.

993
01:14:13.175 --> 01:14:14.975
I'm out of ammo.

994
01:14:16.378 --> 01:14:18.111
CK, does this thing
go any faster?


995
01:14:18.113 --> 01:14:20.480
Might not matter if the
airdrop's on time.


996
01:14:20.482 --> 01:14:22.115
We gotta find some cover.

997
01:14:22.117 --> 01:14:23.250
All right.

998
01:14:23.252 --> 01:14:25.919
Check under the blanket!

999
01:14:32.995 --> 01:14:34.795
Mommy, I'm scared.

1000
01:14:40.269 --> 01:14:42.769
Slow down! Slow down!

1001
01:14:53.282 --> 01:14:55.849
So this is your operation.

1002
01:15:00.889 --> 01:15:02.656
Ah, nuts!

1003
01:15:09.231 --> 01:15:10.997
Faster, CK!

1004
01:15:10.999 --> 01:15:13.099
Sarge, I think
the fuel tank took a hit,


1005
01:15:13.101 --> 01:15:14.668
'cause we are
losing petrol fast!


1006
01:15:14.670 --> 01:15:15.836
We need to outrun that tank,

1007
01:15:15.838 --> 01:15:17.170
or it's gonna plow
right over us!


1008
01:15:17.172 --> 01:15:19.639
I'll get us as far
as I can, but, uh...


1009
01:15:20.742 --> 01:15:22.175
That ain't good.

1010
01:15:40.062 --> 01:15:41.528
There it is!

1011
01:15:41.530 --> 01:15:43.530
I see American flags
one click ahead!


1012
01:15:48.136 --> 01:15:49.402
Ah, ah, no!

1013
01:15:49.404 --> 01:15:50.670
No, no, no, no, no!

1014
01:15:50.672 --> 01:15:52.205
Come on, baby! Not now!

1015
01:15:52.207 --> 01:15:54.040
We try to coast, that tank's
gonna run right over us.


1016
01:15:54.042 --> 01:15:56.209
We can make a run for it
if we stop!


1017
01:15:56.211 --> 01:15:57.878
Copy that!

1018
01:16:07.956 --> 01:16:10.657
Help them down.
- Come on. Come on, honey.


1019
01:16:10.659 --> 01:16:12.192
We gotta get
a move on CK.


1020
01:16:12.194 --> 01:16:14.227
Operation's Big Bombs are
going to drop any second.


1021
01:16:14.229 --> 01:16:15.896
Come on. Come on. Come on.

1022
01:16:25.240 --> 01:16:27.641
<i>Scheisse.</i>

1023
01:16:32.481 --> 01:16:34.481
CK, we lost Claudette!

1024
01:16:34.483 --> 01:16:35.749
Take her. I'm going back.

1025
01:16:35.751 --> 01:16:37.517
I'll meet you
at the rally point.


1026
01:16:37.519 --> 01:16:39.619
Yes, Sergeant!

1027
01:17:03.445 --> 01:17:04.744
Claudette!

1028
01:17:11.153 --> 01:17:12.752
No!

1029
01:18:39.608 --> 01:18:42.876
Looks like we both lose...

1030
01:18:42.878 --> 01:18:45.712
you Nazi son of a bitch.

1031
01:18:46.915 --> 01:18:50.850
At least I get
to watch you die!


1032
01:18:55.457 --> 01:18:57.323
Aah!

1033
01:19:35.297 --> 01:19:36.696
Hey.

1034
01:19:36.698 --> 01:19:39.132
Claudette! Hey!

1035
01:19:39.134 --> 01:19:40.333
Amelie...

1036
01:19:40.335 --> 01:19:41.434
where is...

1037
01:19:41.436 --> 01:19:42.502
CK has her.

1038
01:19:42.704 --> 01:19:43.703
Get up. Okay.

1039
01:19:43.705 --> 01:19:44.704
Come on.

1040
01:19:50.746 --> 01:19:51.811
It is too late.

1041
01:19:51.813 --> 01:19:53.880
Probably.

1042
01:19:56.651 --> 01:19:58.331
Come on. 
- All right.

1043
01:20:02.257 --> 01:20:03.590
Come on.

1044
01:20:03.592 --> 01:20:05.258
Come on.

1045
01:20:08.063 --> 01:20:10.096
Come on. You can make it!

1046
01:20:18.240 --> 01:20:20.273
Come on, Sister.

1047
01:20:20.275 --> 01:20:21.341
Come on.

1048
01:20:23.078 --> 01:20:26.112
Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

1049
01:20:28.784 --> 01:20:30.150
Hey, get down.

1050
01:20:54.309 --> 01:20:57.510
Sarge!

1051
01:21:00.715 --> 01:21:03.383
Sarge!

1052
01:21:16.364 --> 01:21:18.464
Hey. Hey. Sarge?

1053
01:21:18.466 --> 01:21:20.433
Sarge? You still with me?

1054
01:21:20.435 --> 01:21:22.236
Come on now. Stay with me.

1055
01:21:23.038 --> 01:21:26.673
Staff Sergeant Freddy McNay!

1056
01:21:26.675 --> 01:21:27.874
What happened to y'all?

1057
01:21:27.876 --> 01:21:30.743
We got ambushed back there, Sarge!
It got too hot!


1058
01:21:30.745 --> 01:21:31.911
Had to get out of there!

1059
01:21:31.913 --> 01:21:34.881
You're too late, of course.

1060
01:21:34.883 --> 01:21:36.282
Probably!

1061
01:21:52.367 --> 01:21:53.433
Whoo!

1062
01:21:59.007 --> 01:22:01.040
This is the final part

1063
01:22:01.042 --> 01:22:03.309
of Operation
Ardennes Fury, Sarge...


1064
01:22:03.311 --> 01:22:05.411
bombs, tanks,

1065
01:22:05.413 --> 01:22:07.680
and one last push across
this damned forest!


1066
01:22:07.682 --> 01:22:11.017
We're gonna blast those Nazi
mothers with everything we got


1067
01:22:11.019 --> 01:22:12.652
all the way to Berlin!

1068
01:22:17.158 --> 01:22:19.078
We're close
to base camp, Lance.


1069
01:22:19.928 --> 01:22:20.960
I'm gonna...

1070
01:22:20.962 --> 01:22:22.862
I'm gonna get some rest now.

1071
01:22:22.864 --> 01:22:25.832
Negative. Negative, Sergeant!

1072
01:22:25.834 --> 01:22:27.600
This is no time for laying down

1073
01:22:27.602 --> 01:22:28.801
on the job! You read me?

1074
01:22:28.803 --> 01:22:31.170
Are you giving me
orders now, Private?


1075
01:22:32.173 --> 01:22:34.407
You stay alive, Sarge,

1076
01:22:34.409 --> 01:22:37.343
I'll sign those
court-martial papers myself.


1077
01:22:37.345 --> 01:22:38.745
Okay.

1078
01:22:51.826 --> 01:22:53.660
Oh, Amelie!

1079
01:23:10.011 --> 01:23:13.146
Thanks for saving us
back there.


1080
01:23:13.148 --> 01:23:14.213
What time you got?

1081
01:23:15.617 --> 01:23:17.317
Doesn't matter.
