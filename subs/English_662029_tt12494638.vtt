00:01:15.424 --> 00:01:20.262
AHED'S KNEE

2
00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:03.907
I'm Ahed Tamimi.

3
00:03:04.449 --> 00:03:09.079
Born on January 31, 2001,
in Nabi Saleh, Palestine.


4
00:03:09.162 --> 00:03:11.873
At age 16, I was sent to jail
for slapping a soldier.


5
00:03:12.499 --> 00:03:13.584
This is my knee.

6
00:03:13.917 --> 00:03:15.502
Your tweet, Mr. Smotrich!

7
00:03:15.961 --> 00:03:19.256
I am very sad that Ahed Tamimi

8
00:03:19.339 --> 00:03:21.425
is simply put under house arrest.

9
00:03:21.883 --> 00:03:25.429
She should have gotten a bullet,

10
00:03:25.512 --> 00:03:28.348
in her kneecap, at least.

11
00:03:28.724 --> 00:03:31.476
That would put her under house arrest

12
00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:33.979
for the rest of her life.

13
00:03:34.396 --> 00:03:35.314
Now I sing?

14
00:04:44.007 --> 00:04:45.258
Eliya Ziv.

15
00:04:45.342 --> 00:04:47.469
16 and a half, Glory Agency.

16
00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:49.554
I'm Bezalel Smotrich.

17
00:04:50.013 --> 00:04:52.057
Minister, member of Parliament,

18
00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:53.684
leader of The Jewish Home.

19
00:04:54.351 --> 00:04:55.644
My childhood.

20
00:04:55.727 --> 00:04:56.728
Your father?

21
00:04:58.063 --> 00:04:59.272
In an Israeli jail.

22
00:04:59.773 --> 00:05:02.067
- His sister?
- Shot dead by a policewoman.


23
00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:04.111
- His brother-in-law?
- Shot dead by a soldier.


24
00:05:04.444 --> 00:05:06.029
- His cousin?
- Shot dead by a soldier.


25
00:05:06.113 --> 00:05:07.114
His nephew?

26
00:05:07.197 --> 00:05:08.573
Shot dead by a settler.

27
00:05:09.074 --> 00:05:10.075
Your mother?

28
00:05:11.618 --> 00:05:12.953
I'm 16.

29
00:05:17.082 --> 00:05:18.125
Your mother!

30
00:05:19.793 --> 00:05:21.294
With me in an Israeli jail.

31
00:05:21.378 --> 00:05:22.212
Louder.

32
00:05:23.338 --> 00:05:24.381
Your female cousin?

33
00:05:26.425 --> 00:05:27.551
With us in jail.

34
00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:34.057
<i>The teen challenging Israel in court</i>

35
00:05:35.308 --> 00:05:36.184
Your male cousin?

36
00:05:39.438 --> 00:05:41.940
Shot in the head by a soldier.
Then imprisoned.


37
00:05:45.402 --> 00:05:46.611
Where is victory?

38
00:05:50.657 --> 00:05:51.783
In my sacrifice.

39
00:05:53.201 --> 00:05:54.369
And liberation?

40
00:06:01.209 --> 00:06:02.335
Liberation?

41
00:06:03.253 --> 00:06:04.504
You keep silent.

42
00:06:11.928 --> 00:06:13.597
I am very sad that Ahed Tamimi...

43
00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:14.639
Smotrich!

44
00:06:14.723 --> 00:06:16.308
This is your tweet.

45
00:06:16.391 --> 00:06:18.101
You saw Ahed on TV.

46
00:06:18.185 --> 00:06:19.436
It drove you nuts.

47
00:06:19.936 --> 00:06:22.314
I am deeply saddened.

48
00:06:22.397 --> 00:06:24.775
She should've received a bullet...

49
00:06:25.442 --> 00:06:28.111
In her kneecap, at least.

50
00:06:28.195 --> 00:06:29.237
Again!

51
00:06:29.321 --> 00:06:30.489
Thrilled, like a bridegroom.

52
00:06:31.406 --> 00:06:33.074
I'm Bezalel Smotrich.

53
00:06:33.742 --> 00:06:34.993
What did I want?

54
00:06:35.786 --> 00:06:38.413
One bullet in her kneecap.

55
00:06:55.430 --> 00:06:56.431
Here.

56
00:06:59.267 --> 00:07:00.852
Now we smash your knee.

57
00:07:52.571 --> 00:07:53.738
Am I interrupting?

58
00:07:57.534 --> 00:07:58.577
Not at all.

59
00:08:00.161 --> 00:08:01.162
Y.

60
00:08:02.163 --> 00:08:04.833
Filmmaker and video artist.
Nice to meet you.


61
00:08:05.292 --> 00:08:08.795
Maayan.
Pilot on the Tel Aviv-Sapir, Arava route.


62
00:08:09.296 --> 00:08:10.714
You're shooting a film?

63
00:08:11.172 --> 00:08:12.090
No.

64
00:08:13.258 --> 00:08:16.261
I have a screening
of a movie I made.

65
00:08:16.344 --> 00:08:17.304
In Sapir.

66
00:08:18.638 --> 00:08:20.932
At the public library, I think.

67
00:08:21.308 --> 00:08:22.517
I was filming a...

68
00:08:24.227 --> 00:08:25.312
They're combat troops.

69
00:08:25.812 --> 00:08:28.440
On a mission. Something in Gaza.

70
00:08:33.320 --> 00:08:35.572
I'm shooting
something personal for someone.


71
00:08:35.655 --> 00:08:37.115
The wing's in the shot.

72
00:08:37.574 --> 00:08:39.492
Can I film from the cockpit?

73
00:08:41.494 --> 00:08:42.746
I won't get you in trouble?

74
00:08:42.829 --> 00:08:43.705
Take a seat.

75
00:08:43.788 --> 00:08:44.623
Thanks.

76
00:08:45.206 --> 00:08:47.375
You made any movies I've heard of?

77
00:08:47.459 --> 00:08:48.293
Just a sec.

78
00:08:59.387 --> 00:09:00.221
Hi.

79
00:09:00.931 --> 00:09:03.099
I hope you had a better night.

80
00:09:04.351 --> 00:09:05.852
I made it to the Arava.

81
00:09:07.145 --> 00:09:08.355
Have a good day.

82
00:09:09.940 --> 00:09:10.941
Love you.

83
00:10:20.593 --> 00:10:21.803
Hello. I'm Yahalom.

84
00:10:22.637 --> 00:10:23.596
Yahalom?

85
00:10:24.055 --> 00:10:25.140
Yahalom David.

86
00:10:25.223 --> 00:10:27.934
Deputy Director, Libraries Division,
Ministry of Culture.


87
00:10:29.436 --> 00:10:30.478
Right, Yahalom.

88
00:10:30.562 --> 00:10:31.646
Emails Yahalom.

89
00:10:33.523 --> 00:10:34.983
I pictured you differently.

90
00:10:35.942 --> 00:10:37.277
You had a good flight?

91
00:10:37.819 --> 00:10:39.988
All good? Not too bumpy?

92
00:10:43.658 --> 00:10:45.785
It beats four hours on a bus.

93
00:10:46.202 --> 00:10:47.787
You didn't get sick?

94
00:10:48.329 --> 00:10:49.330
No.

95
00:10:50.040 --> 00:10:54.169
I didn't expect to see you.
I thought you were in an office


96
00:10:54.252 --> 00:10:56.212
in Jerusalem or Tel Aviv.

97
00:10:56.713 --> 00:10:59.549
Yes, we're based in Jerusalem
at the Ministry.


98
00:11:00.050 --> 00:11:01.134
But I came.

99
00:11:04.220 --> 00:11:05.388
I grew up here.

100
00:11:06.556 --> 00:11:08.600
Well, not here exactly.

101
00:11:08.683 --> 00:11:10.018
A village nearby.

102
00:11:10.477 --> 00:11:14.647
But all the local kids
went to high school here.


103
00:11:15.356 --> 00:11:17.484
Some grades had practically no students.

104
00:11:24.657 --> 00:11:26.868
Any idea of Arava's population?

105
00:11:26.951 --> 00:11:27.952
No.

106
00:11:28.578 --> 00:11:30.288
I bet you never came.

107
00:11:30.371 --> 00:11:32.040
No, I'm from Tel Aviv.

108
00:11:32.123 --> 00:11:33.291
Born and raised?

109
00:11:33.666 --> 00:11:34.584
Yes.

110
00:11:34.667 --> 00:11:35.585
Awesome.

111
00:11:36.294 --> 00:11:39.214
I did my military service
on the Syria-Lebanon border.


112
00:11:39.297 --> 00:11:40.757
When we occupied Lebanon.

113
00:11:41.508 --> 00:11:42.675
I'm old.

114
00:11:44.302 --> 00:11:45.887
So, Arava's population?

115
00:11:45.970 --> 00:11:47.222
You'll never guess.

116
00:11:47.305 --> 00:11:48.306
50,000.

117
00:11:49.474 --> 00:11:50.642
3,000.

118
00:11:50.725 --> 00:11:52.685
3,000 people, that's all.

119
00:11:52.769 --> 00:11:54.521
Incredible. As many as my street.

120
00:11:55.063 --> 00:11:56.481
So there's no one here.

121
00:11:57.315 --> 00:11:58.608
My family lives here.

122
00:11:59.150 --> 00:12:00.985
Parents, some brothers and sisters.

123
00:12:01.069 --> 00:12:03.613
I can see my family
and attend your event.


124
00:12:06.407 --> 00:12:09.285
I must admit
I really love your films.


125
00:12:09.661 --> 00:12:11.371
Actually, I'm happy to admit it.

126
00:12:12.413 --> 00:12:13.540
You've seen them?

127
00:12:14.457 --> 00:12:16.000
I wouldn't say so otherwise.

128
00:12:17.544 --> 00:12:18.545
Thanks.

129
00:12:21.714 --> 00:12:22.841
Shall we go in?

130
00:12:23.341 --> 00:12:24.592
See your flat?

131
00:13:00.587 --> 00:13:01.588
Nice.

132
00:13:02.463 --> 00:13:05.717
I'm glad you like it.
You don't have to be polite.


133
00:13:05.800 --> 00:13:08.178
Any issues, just let me know.

134
00:13:09.262 --> 00:13:11.764
It's an honor for Sapir and the Arava,

135
00:13:11.848 --> 00:13:13.892
and me personally, to have you here.

136
00:13:16.227 --> 00:13:17.187
Thanks.

137
00:13:18.897 --> 00:13:19.939
Water?

138
00:13:22.650 --> 00:13:25.528
I imagined someone older,
from your emails.


139
00:13:26.237 --> 00:13:29.032
The way I phrase things?
People say that.


140
00:13:29.115 --> 00:13:30.366
And your job.

141
00:13:30.909 --> 00:13:35.455
Deputy director,
division of public libraries...


142
00:13:35.788 --> 00:13:39.834
Deputy Director, Libraries Division,
Ministry of Culture.


143
00:13:49.510 --> 00:13:53.556
I started out running the library
where the screening is this evening.


144
00:13:54.641 --> 00:13:56.392
<i>My evening ended in bed.</i>

145
00:14:05.318 --> 00:14:07.195
It's at five, remember.

146
00:14:09.072 --> 00:14:09.948
Okay?

147
00:14:28.758 --> 00:14:30.969
How did you come to run a library?

148
00:14:32.136 --> 00:14:33.221
You want to know?

149
00:14:35.223 --> 00:14:36.933
It's not much of a story.

150
00:14:39.560 --> 00:14:41.229
I was a big reader as a kid.

151
00:14:41.312 --> 00:14:44.732
All kinds of books,
anything I could find.


152
00:14:44.816 --> 00:14:46.609
No idea where I got it from.

153
00:14:46.693 --> 00:14:49.779
My parents didn't read much.
The paper occasionally.


154
00:14:49.862 --> 00:14:50.989
But hardly ever.

155
00:14:51.072 --> 00:14:52.365
My siblings read...

156
00:14:53.032 --> 00:14:54.158
WhatsApp messages.

157
00:14:56.786 --> 00:14:58.329
And you? Directing?

158
00:14:58.871 --> 00:15:00.665
Never mind. Keep going.

159
00:15:04.585 --> 00:15:08.965
Father, an art critic.
Mother, a playwright and screenwriter.


160
00:15:09.465 --> 00:15:12.844
Aged 4, I was drawing the
steps in <i>Battleship Potemkin.</i>


161
00:15:12.927 --> 00:15:14.929
Or the knights in <i>Alexander Nevsky.</i>

162
00:15:15.346 --> 00:15:16.681
You don't know them.

163
00:15:16.764 --> 00:15:18.891
They're films by a Russian director,

164
00:15:18.975 --> 00:15:22.437
a radical genius and fervent communist,
gagged by Stalin.


165
00:15:22.520 --> 00:15:24.314
You're right, I don't know them.

166
00:15:24.397 --> 00:15:25.565
I'll look them up.

167
00:15:25.648 --> 00:15:27.442
A Russian filmmaker and communist.

168
00:15:27.525 --> 00:15:28.943
Alexander Nevsky?

169
00:15:30.570 --> 00:15:31.487
Yes.

170
00:15:34.032 --> 00:15:35.116
Keep going.

171
00:15:37.118 --> 00:15:39.787
When they opened
Arava's first library here,


172
00:15:39.871 --> 00:15:41.831
I'd just finished military service.

173
00:15:42.206 --> 00:15:46.085
They were hiring a library director
but I had to do everything.


174
00:15:46.169 --> 00:15:48.421
Manager, librarian, cleaner too.

175
00:15:49.756 --> 00:15:51.215
Yes, cleaning.

176
00:15:51.299 --> 00:15:54.218
After 3-4 years,
our budget was increased.


177
00:15:54.302 --> 00:15:55.428
I'd got people reading

178
00:15:55.887 --> 00:15:57.972
or just visiting the library,

179
00:15:58.056 --> 00:15:59.974
looking at book covers, wondering,

180
00:16:00.308 --> 00:16:02.060
"What's this one about?"

181
00:16:02.143 --> 00:16:04.270
They gave me an intern.

182
00:16:04.354 --> 00:16:07.940
And I became director of libraries,
Arava region.


183
00:16:08.649 --> 00:16:11.736
Then the new government
introduced its reforms.


184
00:16:12.070 --> 00:16:14.489
You must know the new chief of staff,

185
00:16:14.572 --> 00:16:16.783
always on TV, not the silent type.

186
00:16:18.201 --> 00:16:19.160
Don't know her.

187
00:16:19.243 --> 00:16:21.662
She called a meeting and told us,

188
00:16:21.746 --> 00:16:24.123
"It's you who decide
what people consume."


189
00:16:24.207 --> 00:16:28.086
I detest people using "consume"
for books and films.


190
00:16:28.169 --> 00:16:29.796
Then she said,

191
00:16:29.879 --> 00:16:33.883
"You'll shape Israelis' culture,
beliefs and thoughts,


192
00:16:33.966 --> 00:16:35.802
"what they find beautiful or ugly.

193
00:16:35.885 --> 00:16:37.261
"Basically, who they are."

194
00:16:37.929 --> 00:16:39.305
Suddenly, it seemed huge.

195
00:16:44.811 --> 00:16:47.188
Am I boring you, blabbing away?

196
00:16:47.271 --> 00:16:48.689
No, I'll just freshen up.

197
00:16:49.982 --> 00:16:51.401
A horrible night's sleep.

198
00:16:54.529 --> 00:16:56.155
You want to take a nap?

199
00:17:18.719 --> 00:17:19.929
Who stayed here last?

200
00:17:21.889 --> 00:17:22.932
No idea.

201
00:17:24.058 --> 00:17:25.143
Not an artist.

202
00:17:28.563 --> 00:17:29.772
What sign are you?

203
00:17:30.731 --> 00:17:31.607
Me?

204
00:17:33.776 --> 00:17:35.069
I'm a spring baby.

205
00:17:36.571 --> 00:17:37.572
Aries.

206
00:17:38.114 --> 00:17:39.157
Same here.

207
00:17:43.536 --> 00:17:45.538
You know what they say about Aries...

208
00:17:51.169 --> 00:17:52.420
Keep going, Yahalom.

209
00:17:56.799 --> 00:18:00.511
Two years ago, something happened
you may have heard about.


210
00:18:01.888 --> 00:18:04.765
The minister and director
had a falling out.


211
00:18:05.141 --> 00:18:06.350
I've no idea...

212
00:18:06.434 --> 00:18:08.144
Actually, I have a good idea.

213
00:18:08.227 --> 00:18:09.687
As you can imagine.

214
00:18:10.104 --> 00:18:13.316
Let's just say
it was over an artwork dealing with...


215
00:18:13.733 --> 00:18:15.693
Not a film, not a book...

216
00:18:16.611 --> 00:18:18.321
The director was fired.

217
00:18:18.404 --> 00:18:21.157
It's trendy to recruit from the regions

218
00:18:21.240 --> 00:18:22.992
and I impressed them.

219
00:18:24.327 --> 00:18:26.162
So I headed to Jerusalem.

220
00:18:26.245 --> 00:18:27.497
To the Ministry.

221
00:18:29.040 --> 00:18:32.418
My parents were sad
that I was leaving Arava.


222
00:18:33.169 --> 00:18:34.378
They must be proud.

223
00:18:34.921 --> 00:18:35.963
Parents.

224
00:18:36.756 --> 00:18:38.966
I saw that you work with your mom.

225
00:18:39.717 --> 00:18:40.885
That's so moving.

226
00:18:42.637 --> 00:18:43.888
She could have come.

227
00:18:47.934 --> 00:18:48.976
Well...

228
00:18:50.061 --> 00:18:52.939
I'll be going. 
Pickup at 4:20?

229
00:18:55.024 --> 00:18:56.567
There's the form...

230
00:18:56.651 --> 00:18:58.152
I don't have it with me.

231
00:18:58.236 --> 00:19:01.781
The library
should have sent it to you to sign.


232
00:19:01.864 --> 00:19:03.241
Did you sign it?

233
00:19:03.324 --> 00:19:05.618
I settled money stuff with the girl here.

234
00:19:06.202 --> 00:19:07.245
Talia.

235
00:19:07.328 --> 00:19:11.082
Sorry, I tried,
but they refuse to cover your expenses.


236
00:19:11.958 --> 00:19:14.835
For me, it's a no-brainer
for a director like you.


237
00:19:14.919 --> 00:19:18.339
Anyway, on the form,
you specify your topic and sign.


238
00:19:18.422 --> 00:19:21.259
It commits you
to addressing a specific subject.


239
00:19:22.552 --> 00:19:23.719
I don't understand.

240
00:19:23.803 --> 00:19:24.762
How can I put it?

241
00:19:24.845 --> 00:19:27.473
There's a list of topics to choose from.

242
00:19:27.557 --> 00:19:29.267
A diverse list.

243
00:19:29.350 --> 00:19:33.062
You check topics you'll discuss,
and you can add others.


244
00:19:33.145 --> 00:19:35.481
You're supposed to have signed it,

245
00:19:35.565 --> 00:19:37.775
for us to approve the screening.

246
00:19:37.858 --> 00:19:39.235
Otherwise, we can't pay you.

247
00:19:40.736 --> 00:19:42.071
What kind of topics?

248
00:19:42.154 --> 00:19:43.990
Lots. I'll bring it tonight.

249
00:19:44.073 --> 00:19:45.116
Such as?

250
00:19:47.618 --> 00:19:49.745
The forces of nature, the sea.

251
00:19:50.371 --> 00:19:53.791
Jewish immigration, diversity,
differences in society.


252
00:19:54.375 --> 00:19:55.543
Sure, they overlap.

253
00:19:56.711 --> 00:19:57.837
Judaism, family...

254
00:19:57.920 --> 00:19:58.754
Love?

255
00:19:59.171 --> 00:20:00.590
I guess. We can add it.

256
00:20:00.673 --> 00:20:01.549
And sex?

257
00:20:04.510 --> 00:20:07.430
And the abject dumbing-down
of this country,


258
00:20:08.014 --> 00:20:10.349
which revels in its own stupidity?

259
00:20:11.684 --> 00:20:14.937
That's actually
what tonight's movie is about.


260
00:20:17.481 --> 00:20:18.649
Look, it's not...

261
00:20:19.233 --> 00:20:21.152
I'm not proud of these forms.

262
00:20:22.069 --> 00:20:23.195
Keep going.

263
00:20:25.573 --> 00:20:27.033
Actually, I'm embarrassed.

264
00:20:31.704 --> 00:20:34.498
They're going way further than before.

265
00:20:34.874 --> 00:20:37.001
They meddle in everything,

266
00:20:37.460 --> 00:20:39.920
so only their pet projects get exposure.

267
00:20:42.089 --> 00:20:44.258
They don't like other people's opinions.

268
00:20:45.009 --> 00:20:45.926
No.

269
00:20:47.845 --> 00:20:48.804
Fine.

270
00:20:53.267 --> 00:20:55.353
Tonight, I'll bring the form so...

271
00:20:55.436 --> 00:20:56.604
And everyone else?

272
00:20:57.605 --> 00:20:59.523
Directors? Writers? Lecturers?

273
00:20:59.940 --> 00:21:00.858
What?

274
00:21:00.941 --> 00:21:01.984
They sign?

275
00:21:03.027 --> 00:21:04.945
I haven't seen anyone who didn't.

276
00:21:07.448 --> 00:21:08.574
I won't sleep.

277
00:21:09.075 --> 00:21:10.201
Don't feel like it.

278
00:21:11.285 --> 00:21:12.870
Is there anything to see?

279
00:21:12.953 --> 00:21:14.038
For sure.

280
00:21:14.580 --> 00:21:16.666
I didn't want to pester you

281
00:21:16.749 --> 00:21:18.959
but the Arava is incredible!

282
00:21:19.043 --> 00:21:21.962
Sand and more sand to get lost in.

283
00:21:22.421 --> 00:21:25.591
I get carried away.
The must-see is 15 minutes away.


284
00:21:25.675 --> 00:21:27.468
It's like a big crevasse.

285
00:21:27.551 --> 00:21:29.720
Outside, head for the big dune.

286
00:21:29.804 --> 00:21:32.014
Go right 700 meters. 
I mean, go east.

287
00:21:32.098 --> 00:21:33.557
We played there as kids.

288
00:21:33.641 --> 00:21:37.061
The recent deluge filled it up,
totally flooded it.


289
00:21:37.395 --> 00:21:39.271
Animals drowned,
there may be skeletons.


290
00:21:39.355 --> 00:21:42.608
I never saw it so full.
It's extraordinary, unprecedented!


291
00:21:42.692 --> 00:21:44.527
A giant pool in the desert!

292
00:21:45.361 --> 00:21:46.404
A miracle.

293
00:25:04.351 --> 00:25:05.269
Hi.

294
00:25:05.352 --> 00:25:06.478
Thanks for calling back.

295
00:25:06.562 --> 00:25:07.688
<i>No problem.</i>

296
00:25:07.771 --> 00:25:08.814
How are you?

297
00:25:09.273 --> 00:25:10.983
<i>Not great, you know.</i>

298
00:25:11.317 --> 00:25:12.902
<i>I'm getting divorced.</i>

299
00:25:12.985 --> 00:25:14.111
Yeah, you said.

300
00:25:15.112 --> 00:25:18.824
<i>Even when feelings have gone,
it's not easy.</i>


301
00:25:18.908 --> 00:25:20.034
Everything's sad.

302
00:25:20.117 --> 00:25:22.494
<i>Dividing up an apartment and everything.</i>

303
00:25:22.578 --> 00:25:23.579
<i>Time erased.</i>

304
00:25:24.204 --> 00:25:26.123
<i>Not erased. 
Memories remain.</i>

305
00:25:26.206 --> 00:25:30.294
<i>But with the resentment,
I don't trust my own memories anymore.</i>


306
00:25:31.712 --> 00:25:32.796
<i>Where are you?</i>

307
00:25:32.880 --> 00:25:33.881
I'm in a...

308
00:25:34.632 --> 00:25:37.051
village called Sapir, in the Arava.

309
00:25:37.718 --> 00:25:41.388
It pays more than the Cinematheque.
Out in the desert. Ever been?


310
00:25:41.472 --> 00:25:42.431
<i>I did my army...</i>

311
00:25:42.514 --> 00:25:44.183
Guess Arava's population.

312
00:25:44.850 --> 00:25:45.851
<i>5,000?</i>

313
00:25:45.935 --> 00:25:46.936
Not bad!

314
00:25:47.478 --> 00:25:50.314
I started casting this weird project,

315
00:25:50.397 --> 00:25:52.441
<i>The Knee of Ahed Tamimi.</i>

316
00:25:52.900 --> 00:25:54.276
Because of Smotrich.

317
00:25:54.360 --> 00:25:56.862
<i>Who said we should cut off her leg?</i>

318
00:25:56.946 --> 00:25:58.113
A bullet in the knee.

319
00:25:58.197 --> 00:26:00.783
He was sad
she wasn't shot in the knee.


320
00:26:00.866 --> 00:26:02.701
So she'd stay home all her life.

321
00:26:03.243 --> 00:26:06.705
It's still hazy, some kind of video art.

322
00:26:06.789 --> 00:26:08.666
What do I know about video art?

323
00:26:09.667 --> 00:26:11.919
<i>It's experimental? 
You have funding?</i>

324
00:26:12.461 --> 00:26:13.671
Not yet.

325
00:26:13.754 --> 00:26:14.922
<i>Not yet?</i>

326
00:26:16.548 --> 00:26:19.510
<i>The way things are going,
beat it to Paris or New York.</i>


327
00:26:19.593 --> 00:26:20.886
<i>In your case, Paris.</i>

328
00:26:21.679 --> 00:26:23.430
That's why I'm calling.

329
00:26:23.514 --> 00:26:25.265
I'm here for a screening,

330
00:26:25.349 --> 00:26:28.143
and there's this girl, Yahalom,

331
00:26:28.686 --> 00:26:31.397
deputy director of libraries
at the Ministry.


332
00:26:31.480 --> 00:26:32.773
I know it sounds...

333
00:26:33.357 --> 00:26:35.567
But with all that's going on,

334
00:26:36.485 --> 00:26:39.697
libraries are becoming cultural hubs,

335
00:26:39.780 --> 00:26:41.240
not just for writers.

336
00:26:42.908 --> 00:26:46.495
<i>I know, there was
that whole censorship story.</i>


337
00:26:46.578 --> 00:26:50.249
She was appointed just after.
She's a kid from around here.


338
00:26:50.332 --> 00:26:51.834
So, she and her boss,

339
00:26:52.292 --> 00:26:54.586
whoever he or she may be,

340
00:26:54.962 --> 00:26:56.922
on instructions from the minister,

341
00:26:57.381 --> 00:27:01.176
decide which films, books and plays
are seen in Israel,


342
00:27:01.260 --> 00:27:02.553
and which...

343
00:27:04.221 --> 00:27:08.600
writers, directors or artists appear,
or stay home.


344
00:27:09.268 --> 00:27:11.228
The financial impact is obvious.

345
00:27:11.311 --> 00:27:14.356
Hitting us in the wallet,
at the supermarket,


346
00:27:14.440 --> 00:27:16.775
making us buy the cheapest brands,

347
00:27:16.859 --> 00:27:18.902
afraid to check our bank balance.

348
00:27:20.571 --> 00:27:23.449
I got her life story. 
She's a talker.

349
00:27:23.782 --> 00:27:25.117
And lovely, by the way.

350
00:27:25.534 --> 00:27:27.911
Not exactly sophisticated

351
00:27:27.995 --> 00:27:30.122
but very moved by art.

352
00:27:30.205 --> 00:27:33.751
How can you get mad
at someone who fights in 50°C heat


353
00:27:33.834 --> 00:27:35.252
for folks to read books?

354
00:27:38.505 --> 00:27:40.257
Then she brings up this form,

355
00:27:40.340 --> 00:27:43.761
on which you choose your topic
from a prepared list.


356
00:27:43.844 --> 00:27:45.304
There are no other options.

357
00:27:45.637 --> 00:27:48.474
No mention of occupation, conflict,
or anything.


358
00:27:49.767 --> 00:27:50.851
<i>What is there?</i>

359
00:27:50.934 --> 00:27:51.894
Guess.

360
00:27:51.977 --> 00:27:54.271
Diversity, the army, 
Jewish history...

361
00:27:54.354 --> 00:27:55.773
Ethnic diversity, religion,

362
00:27:55.856 --> 00:27:59.359
tolerance, Judaism and the diaspora,
Jewish holidays,


363
00:27:59.443 --> 00:28:00.861
our national history...

364
00:28:01.737 --> 00:28:03.655
wars, the Holocaust,

365
00:28:03.739 --> 00:28:06.075
anti
-Semitism, the Torah, Judaism,

366
00:28:06.158 --> 00:28:09.286
family, father-son, mother-daughter,
friends, love,


367
00:28:09.369 --> 00:28:11.121
army, flag, nation.

368
00:28:11.205 --> 00:28:12.164
<i>All right.</i>

369
00:28:12.915 --> 00:28:14.208
Besides that, nothing.

370
00:28:15.334 --> 00:28:16.627
<i>The country's finished.</i>

371
00:28:16.710 --> 00:28:20.881
The amazing thing is,
this librarian agrees with us.


372
00:28:20.964 --> 00:28:22.466
She says that the Ministry

373
00:28:22.549 --> 00:28:25.135
wants control
over every song, play or movie.


374
00:28:25.219 --> 00:28:27.262
Anyone who dissents is crushed.

375
00:28:27.346 --> 00:28:28.931
And she's from the Ministry,

376
00:28:29.014 --> 00:28:32.059
taking orders from the minister
and his vile chief of staff.


377
00:28:32.142 --> 00:28:33.227
<i>- Sure.</i>
- We're lost.


378
00:28:33.602 --> 00:28:34.895
For her to say,

379
00:28:34.978 --> 00:28:38.649
"We, Israel's Ministry of Culture,
are waging war on art,"


380
00:28:38.732 --> 00:28:40.359
that cannot be erased.

381
00:28:41.110 --> 00:28:42.111
Ever.

382
00:28:43.529 --> 00:28:45.030
Maybe there'll be a miracle.

383
00:28:48.659 --> 00:28:49.618
<i>Right.</i>

384
00:28:49.701 --> 00:28:50.953
You'll publish it?

385
00:28:51.787 --> 00:28:52.704
<i>Okay.</i>

386
00:28:53.497 --> 00:28:54.748
You're not scared?

387
00:28:54.832 --> 00:28:56.458
<i>Sure, but let's be brave.</i>

388
00:28:56.542 --> 00:28:59.586
<i>Worst case,
it's not like the press pays well now.</i>


389
00:29:00.838 --> 00:29:03.048
<i>You'll get her to talk and tape her?</i>

390
00:29:03.132 --> 00:29:04.299
Saying what?

391
00:29:05.050 --> 00:29:06.426
<i>As much as possible.</i>

392
00:29:08.554 --> 00:29:09.847
<i>You can help her.</i>

393
00:29:17.855 --> 00:29:18.981
I'll do it.

394
00:29:19.857 --> 00:29:20.858
<i>Cool.</i>

395
00:29:23.485 --> 00:29:24.611
Film her, too?

396
00:29:25.863 --> 00:29:27.030
<i>Audio will do.</i>

397
00:29:29.324 --> 00:29:30.617
<i>You'll send it tonight?</i>

398
00:29:31.493 --> 00:29:32.661
After the screening.

399
00:29:33.245 --> 00:29:34.371
<i>Happy screening.</i>

400
00:29:34.454 --> 00:29:35.706
Happy divorce.

401
00:30:18.707 --> 00:30:19.583
Mom...

402
00:30:21.501 --> 00:30:23.086
You good? Feeling okay?

403
00:30:24.880 --> 00:30:26.590
How's your breathing? Your back?

404
00:30:28.383 --> 00:30:29.885
I'm in the Arava.

405
00:30:30.844 --> 00:30:33.513
I started casting <i>The Knee of Ahed Tamimi.</i>

406
00:30:34.514 --> 00:30:36.141
It filled me with doubt.

407
00:30:37.476 --> 00:30:38.769
Now I'm in the desert.

408
00:30:40.479 --> 00:30:42.397
They asked why you didn't come.

409
00:30:43.941 --> 00:30:46.068
I'm showing you their wonder.

410
00:30:46.818 --> 00:30:51.657
A big crevasse filled by floods
that killed humans and animals.


411
00:30:52.574 --> 00:30:53.992
A good place to die.

412
00:30:55.953 --> 00:30:57.079
See it, Mom?

413
00:30:58.538 --> 00:31:00.082
They told me, "It's a miracle!"

414
00:31:01.291 --> 00:31:02.376
A miracle.

415
00:33:08.877 --> 00:33:10.545
Excuse me, where's the restaurant?

416
00:33:10.962 --> 00:33:11.963
There!

417
00:33:12.881 --> 00:33:13.882
Thanks!

418
00:35:22.385 --> 00:35:23.345
Hello.

419
00:35:26.848 --> 00:35:27.849
Excuse me...

420
00:35:34.940 --> 00:35:36.066
Who are you?

421
00:35:40.529 --> 00:35:41.613
Who are you?

422
00:35:49.996 --> 00:35:51.289
When are you singing?

423
00:35:52.999 --> 00:35:54.125
Day after tomorrow.

424
00:35:55.502 --> 00:35:56.586
I'll be gone.

425
00:36:00.173 --> 00:36:01.341
What's your name?

426
00:36:02.634 --> 00:36:03.927
We do covers.

427
00:36:06.096 --> 00:36:07.180
Great name.

428
00:36:49.472 --> 00:36:50.932
Hi, is this Y?

429
00:36:51.975 --> 00:36:52.809
Yes.

430
00:36:54.185 --> 00:36:57.689
I'm Bar, the actress
from the audition earlier.


431
00:36:57.772 --> 00:36:58.982
<i>For Ahed Tamimi.</i>

432
00:37:01.776 --> 00:37:04.237
Sorry to call.
Super unprofessional, I know.


433
00:37:04.654 --> 00:37:07.699
I got your number from Hila,
the casting director.


434
00:37:07.782 --> 00:37:09.743
She told me not to tell you.

435
00:37:10.910 --> 00:37:13.747
She also thought it was super good today.

436
00:37:15.206 --> 00:37:16.207
<i>Fine.</i>

437
00:37:18.752 --> 00:37:20.962
I just need to say, 
I feel it's me.

438
00:37:21.713 --> 00:37:22.881
Ahed is me.

439
00:37:22.964 --> 00:37:25.216
I'll go as deep as I can.

440
00:37:25.300 --> 00:37:26.343
Really, I'll...

441
00:37:27.636 --> 00:37:28.553
Sorry.

442
00:37:28.928 --> 00:37:30.472
I read stuff online

443
00:37:30.847 --> 00:37:33.224
and I realized all we did to her.

444
00:37:33.642 --> 00:37:35.644
It broke my heart. Really.

445
00:37:36.269 --> 00:37:37.812
I feel I can go

446
00:37:37.896 --> 00:37:41.441
<i>as deep as you
want me to go. Really.</i>

447
00:37:41.524 --> 00:37:45.153
<i>I saw a YouTube video of her
with her cousin, who's so pretty.</i>


448
00:37:45.737 --> 00:37:48.573
<i>Actually, Ahed's really pretty, too,</i>

449
00:37:48.657 --> 00:37:51.326
<i>and I felt so inspired. 
It was so...</i>

450
00:37:51.409 --> 00:37:52.619
What about your father?

451
00:37:52.702 --> 00:37:54.663
No, it's no problem.

452
00:37:54.996 --> 00:37:57.374
Really. He's fine with it.

453
00:37:58.500 --> 00:38:01.294
I read Ahed's scenes to him earlier.

454
00:38:01.378 --> 00:38:03.171
Only him. He won't tell anyone.

455
00:38:05.006 --> 00:38:06.299
I felt so emotional.

456
00:38:07.884 --> 00:38:08.718
So emotional.

457
00:38:10.804 --> 00:38:12.472
<i>My voice was shaking.</i>

458
00:38:13.056 --> 00:38:17.060
<i>I could hardly speak.
The words wouldn't come out.</i>


459
00:38:17.769 --> 00:38:19.104
<i>My father said,</i>

460
00:38:19.187 --> 00:38:22.148
<i>"Go on, go on, it's beautiful!"</i>

461
00:38:22.232 --> 00:38:23.650
<i>I sensed that he also...</i>

462
00:38:24.067 --> 00:38:25.527
<i>That my father also...</i>

463
00:38:26.486 --> 00:38:27.904
<i>had goosebumps too.</i>

464
00:38:28.446 --> 00:38:29.531
<i>Really.</i>

465
00:38:30.073 --> 00:38:31.032
<i>His eyes</i>

466
00:38:31.449 --> 00:38:32.534
<i>were moist.</i>

467
00:38:32.617 --> 00:38:34.494
<i>I'd never seen him like that.</i>

468
00:38:35.620 --> 00:38:36.955
<i>I started crying...</i>

469
00:38:37.038 --> 00:38:38.540
Ahed Tamimi doesn't cry.

470
00:38:43.920 --> 00:38:45.672
You were good. We'll see.

471
00:39:04.858 --> 00:39:08.153
<i>Hey, sweetie.
Sorry, I was at a funeral.</i>


472
00:39:08.945 --> 00:39:10.572
<i>How did the auditions go?</i>

473
00:39:10.655 --> 00:39:11.781
<i>You're in Tel Aviv?</i>

474
00:39:12.323 --> 00:39:14.993
<i>I read what you
sent</i> about The Knee of...

475
00:39:32.927 --> 00:39:36.306
<i>Obviously, count me in.
Come hell or high water!</i>


476
00:39:36.389 --> 00:39:37.849
<i>But your project's still...</i>

477
00:39:38.558 --> 00:39:39.809
<i>taking shape.</i>

478
00:39:39.893 --> 00:39:42.228
<i>Do you plan to shoot in Tel Aviv?</i>

479
00:39:42.312 --> 00:39:45.315
<i>The real location in the territories
will be tricky.</i>


480
00:39:45.774 --> 00:39:46.691
<i>She's Palestin...</i>

481
00:40:04.709 --> 00:40:06.836
<i>Anyway, we'll need the Army's permission.</i>

482
00:40:07.253 --> 00:40:11.216
<i>Or you shoot in Tel Aviv,
everybody unpaid, including you.</i>


483
00:40:11.299 --> 00:40:12.842
<i>That could work,</i>

484
00:40:12.926 --> 00:40:15.929
<i>but we'll all be in trouble
if word gets out.</i>


485
00:40:18.306 --> 00:40:21.684
<i>We'll come up with something
for when she's doing math</i>


486
00:40:21.768 --> 00:40:23.478
<i>in her cell for her exams.</i>

487
00:40:23.561 --> 00:40:26.898
<i>Somewhere small, no windows,
like my parking garage.</i>


488
00:40:27.398 --> 00:40:31.736
<i>But if you want the arrest
and her cousin's funeral,</i>


489
00:40:31.820 --> 00:40:34.531
<i>we'll need to find some funding.</i>

490
00:40:35.907 --> 00:40:38.576
<i>What if you show
the soldier's point of view?</i>


491
00:40:38.660 --> 00:40:40.411
<i>The soldier who clashes with her.</i>

492
00:40:40.954 --> 00:40:42.997
<i>You wanted to make it personal, right?</i>

493
00:41:05.562 --> 00:41:07.522
Yahalom told me a lot about you.

494
00:41:07.605 --> 00:41:09.274
Library Yahalom?

495
00:41:09.357 --> 00:41:10.650
Our Yahalom.

496
00:41:12.527 --> 00:41:14.696
I married a childhood friend of hers.

497
00:41:16.406 --> 00:41:17.657
Yahalom introduced us.

498
00:41:23.955 --> 00:41:25.164
No...

499
00:41:25.248 --> 00:41:26.082
Thanks.

500
00:41:26.875 --> 00:41:28.543
Despite our age difference.

501
00:41:30.545 --> 00:41:32.213
Any idea of Yahalom's age?

502
00:41:32.297 --> 00:41:33.256
No.

503
00:41:34.257 --> 00:41:35.300
Very young.

504
00:41:39.721 --> 00:41:41.639
She brings lots of shows here.

505
00:41:42.599 --> 00:41:44.517
Last week, the guy who sings

506
00:41:45.560 --> 00:41:47.770
<i>I'll head home on the gravel road.</i>

507
00:41:47.854 --> 00:41:49.272
- Know him.
- Bearded guy.


508
00:41:50.565 --> 00:41:52.108
And the actor who went religious

509
00:41:52.191 --> 00:41:53.276
and started singing.

510
00:41:59.240 --> 00:42:02.660
She's done a great job
advertising your screening.


511
00:42:04.495 --> 00:42:05.580
Good.

512
00:42:06.789 --> 00:42:08.249
Usually, people come.

513
00:42:28.519 --> 00:42:29.854
What a coincidence.

514
00:42:29.938 --> 00:42:31.397
This song's in my movie.

515
00:44:19.255 --> 00:44:20.715
That's the film's ending.

516
00:44:25.344 --> 00:44:27.513
Vulgarity's victory march.

517
00:44:39.192 --> 00:44:40.234
Stop for her.

518
00:44:56.709 --> 00:44:57.543
Ayalot.

519
00:44:59.045 --> 00:45:00.004
Sapir?

520
00:45:03.758 --> 00:45:05.051
We're going to a movie.

521
00:45:18.314 --> 00:45:19.565
So, what do you do?

522
00:45:20.566 --> 00:45:21.776
I install solar panels.

523
00:45:22.276 --> 00:45:25.488
Here, there's not many people
but lots of sunshine.


524
00:45:26.447 --> 00:45:27.740
Competition's fierce.

525
00:45:27.824 --> 00:45:30.076
All of Arava is doing solar now.

526
00:45:30.451 --> 00:45:32.120
After the bell pepper trauma.

527
00:45:32.703 --> 00:45:34.497
Sure. Arava is bell peppers.

528
00:45:34.580 --> 00:45:36.207
It was. In the past.

529
00:45:36.541 --> 00:45:38.167
Summer starts early here.

530
00:45:38.251 --> 00:45:41.045
Two months before Holland,
one month before Spain.


531
00:45:41.129 --> 00:45:43.422
The fleshiest peppers in the world.

532
00:45:43.506 --> 00:45:44.590
We all grew them.

533
00:45:44.674 --> 00:45:46.425
World champions of peppers!

534
00:45:46.509 --> 00:45:47.552
You're with me?

535
00:45:48.219 --> 00:45:49.303
Yes, it's interesting.

536
00:45:49.762 --> 00:45:51.013
That's when it hit.

537
00:45:51.514 --> 00:45:52.807
Global warming.

538
00:45:53.599 --> 00:45:56.978
Suddenly, our sun's blazing
on Spanish peppers.


539
00:45:57.520 --> 00:45:59.147
We lost the Russian market.

540
00:45:59.772 --> 00:46:02.066
Fields of peppers rotting in the sun.

541
00:46:02.567 --> 00:46:03.609
Worthless.

542
00:46:04.527 --> 00:46:06.028
We all went bankrupt.

543
00:46:07.446 --> 00:46:08.990
Everything belongs to the banks.

544
00:46:09.740 --> 00:46:10.867
We're slaves.

545
00:46:25.339 --> 00:46:27.383
That drives people to suicide.

546
00:46:43.274 --> 00:46:45.860
So I started working with bees.

547
00:46:46.819 --> 00:46:47.820
Apiculture?

548
00:46:49.197 --> 00:46:51.490
I used to make honey, as a hobby.

549
00:46:52.033 --> 00:46:54.952
Then I got tendinitis in this shoulder.

550
00:46:56.078 --> 00:46:58.080
Tried everything, nothing worked.

551
00:46:58.164 --> 00:46:59.165
Pain...

552
00:46:59.582 --> 00:47:01.500
So bad I couldn't speak.

553
00:47:04.045 --> 00:47:08.925
My wife happened to watch a program
about bee poison.


554
00:47:09.008 --> 00:47:10.259
No, not poison.

555
00:47:10.343 --> 00:47:11.302
The stinger.

556
00:47:11.761 --> 00:47:12.762
The venom.

557
00:47:13.137 --> 00:47:14.263
As a cure.

558
00:47:14.639 --> 00:47:18.559
I took a bee from the hive
and pressed it on my shoulder.


559
00:47:18.643 --> 00:47:20.269
It didn't want to sting me.

560
00:47:20.353 --> 00:47:22.980
I kept squeezing it with two fingers.

561
00:47:23.481 --> 00:47:24.607
It had no choice.

562
00:47:24.690 --> 00:47:25.608
Sting!

563
00:47:25.691 --> 00:47:26.776
Twenty bees.

564
00:47:29.487 --> 00:47:30.321
Since then,

565
00:47:30.863 --> 00:47:31.864
nothing.

566
00:47:35.243 --> 00:47:37.912
So I'm researching the field of bee venom

567
00:47:37.995 --> 00:47:39.789
for healing purposes.

568
00:47:40.915 --> 00:47:41.874
Yes.

569
00:47:44.669 --> 00:47:48.005
They say it works
for many different conditions.


570
00:47:48.506 --> 00:47:50.675
Infections, viral diseases,

571
00:47:51.550 --> 00:47:52.635
cancer...

572
00:47:53.803 --> 00:47:55.388
What do they say about cancer?

573
00:47:56.138 --> 00:47:57.974
There are firsthand accounts.

574
00:48:00.851 --> 00:48:02.228
My mother has cancer.

575
00:48:07.525 --> 00:48:08.776
I'm sorry, man.

576
00:48:14.198 --> 00:48:16.117
Now, lots of people recover.

577
00:48:18.411 --> 00:48:19.787
What kind does she have?

578
00:48:21.247 --> 00:48:22.248
Lungs.

579
00:48:29.714 --> 00:48:30.840
Miracles happen.

580
00:48:41.517 --> 00:48:42.560
<i>Hey.</i>

581
00:48:45.354 --> 00:48:46.814
<i>Filmmaker</i>

582
00:48:47.398 --> 00:48:49.233
<i>in the Arava.</i>

583
00:48:51.444 --> 00:48:55.448
<i>They're showing a film I made.</i>

584
00:48:58.075 --> 00:49:00.286
<i>It premiered in Berlin!</i>

585
00:49:03.456 --> 00:49:05.041
<i>Why no photo?</i>

586
00:49:07.001 --> 00:49:08.502
<i>I am</i>

587
00:49:10.379 --> 00:49:13.007
<i>kind of famous.</i>

588
00:49:17.136 --> 00:49:19.388
<i>And you? Why not your face?</i>

589
00:49:21.849 --> 00:49:24.727
<i>I'm married</i>

590
00:49:26.896 --> 00:49:28.272
<i>Interesting!</i>

591
00:49:28.939 --> 00:49:32.193
10, 9, 8, 7, 6,
5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

592
00:49:32.860 --> 00:49:36.030
9, 8, 7, 6,
5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

593
00:49:38.074 --> 00:49:39.408
<i>Come on!</i>

594
00:49:39.492 --> 00:49:41.452
8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

595
00:49:41.535 --> 00:49:43.120
7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

596
00:49:43.204 --> 00:49:44.372
5, 4, 3, 2, 1...

597
00:49:44.705 --> 00:49:45.748
All good?

598
00:49:45.831 --> 00:49:46.791
Sure.

599
00:49:47.666 --> 00:49:49.335
Narkis, my little sister.

600
00:49:52.254 --> 00:49:53.506
She's shy.

601
00:49:53.589 --> 00:49:54.965
Don't be shy, Narkis.

602
00:49:56.258 --> 00:49:57.301
I'm sorry,

603
00:49:58.094 --> 00:50:00.054
not many people came.

604
00:50:02.306 --> 00:50:03.849
They complain they're bored,

605
00:50:03.933 --> 00:50:06.602
but when something's on,
they stay in bed.


606
00:50:06.685 --> 00:50:08.104
They live like plants.

607
00:50:12.900 --> 00:50:14.652
I brought my family as backup.

608
00:50:14.735 --> 00:50:16.237
That's our mother.

609
00:50:16.320 --> 00:50:18.823
Dad behind her,
with the citrus platter.


610
00:50:21.033 --> 00:50:22.701
Plus uncles and aunts.

611
00:50:22.785 --> 00:50:23.953
Our brother maybe.

612
00:50:34.338 --> 00:50:35.464
How are you?

613
00:50:58.237 --> 00:50:59.488
Excuse me.

614
00:51:00.406 --> 00:51:02.241
What is the film's rating?

615
00:51:02.324 --> 00:51:03.325
Meaning?

616
00:51:03.409 --> 00:51:04.785
The minimum age allowed?

617
00:51:04.869 --> 00:51:07.288
In Israel, 16. 
In France, 12.

618
00:51:08.831 --> 00:51:11.041
The youngest is 14. It's fine.

619
00:51:11.375 --> 00:51:15.296
If you have a sweet tooth,
try my aunt's apricot cake.


620
00:51:15.379 --> 00:51:16.589
Spectacular.

621
00:51:16.672 --> 00:51:18.299
She's our mom's cousin,

622
00:51:18.382 --> 00:51:19.717
but we call her Auntie.

623
00:51:36.233 --> 00:51:37.151
Auntie...

624
00:51:37.234 --> 00:51:38.777
Take this to your grave!

625
00:51:38.861 --> 00:51:40.946
...is a better cook than Mom.

626
00:51:45.910 --> 00:51:48.329
My old music teacher came.

627
00:51:48.412 --> 00:51:49.747
I used to play piano.

628
00:51:50.414 --> 00:51:51.916
- Weddings?
- Classical.


629
00:51:51.999 --> 00:51:55.503
Only me in the village.
I was no good but I persevered.


630
00:51:55.586 --> 00:51:57.588
I gave a recital. Rachmaninoff.

631
00:51:58.380 --> 00:51:59.590
I was terrible.

632
00:52:22.488 --> 00:52:24.573
Thank you for the warm welcome.

633
00:52:29.620 --> 00:52:33.541
This film has gone around the world,
taking me with it,


634
00:52:33.999 --> 00:52:36.043
but it's my first time in the Arava.

635
00:52:36.585 --> 00:52:37.753
Maybe not the last.

636
00:52:39.213 --> 00:52:41.215
All you're about to see is true.

637
00:52:42.091 --> 00:52:43.634
All the events took place.

638
00:52:44.051 --> 00:52:45.594
All the characters existed.

639
00:52:45.970 --> 00:52:48.430
The repetitive aspect is taken from life.

640
00:52:49.807 --> 00:52:51.600
Just pay attention to the style.

641
00:52:52.768 --> 00:52:56.355
See you afterward for a session
of questions and answers.


642
00:52:57.022 --> 00:52:59.108
Although there are no answers.

643
00:53:00.067 --> 00:53:01.110
With you?

644
00:53:01.860 --> 00:53:03.487
Y, sorry...

645
00:53:03.571 --> 00:53:04.822
I'll be moderating.

646
00:53:07.449 --> 00:53:08.492
Good.

647
00:53:08.826 --> 00:53:12.538
My mother,
who writes my movies with me...


648
00:53:12.871 --> 00:53:14.164
She's a screenwriter.

649
00:53:14.540 --> 00:53:15.874
She always says,

650
00:53:15.958 --> 00:53:18.377
"At the end, geography wins."

651
00:53:19.920 --> 00:53:21.922
That reminds me of the Arava.

652
00:53:23.549 --> 00:53:25.467
She says it about Israel.

653
00:53:27.595 --> 00:53:29.096
Not necessarily in a good way.

654
00:54:12.014 --> 00:54:13.849
What do I do during the film?

655
00:54:16.060 --> 00:54:17.436
You're not staying?

656
00:54:18.646 --> 00:54:21.398
I love my films
but I can't watch them.

657
00:54:23.400 --> 00:54:25.611
I'll come outside with you.

658
00:54:30.783 --> 00:54:32.076
I've seen it twice.

659
00:55:04.441 --> 00:55:07.444
I had some questions about the movie.

660
00:55:08.237 --> 00:55:10.447
It's so unpredictable.

661
00:55:10.531 --> 00:55:11.532
Innovative.

662
00:55:12.449 --> 00:55:14.076
Innovative, I don't know.

663
00:55:14.743 --> 00:55:15.786
But thanks.

664
00:55:19.164 --> 00:55:20.457
It's a film

665
00:55:20.999 --> 00:55:22.626
that reinvents the genre.

666
00:55:23.043 --> 00:55:24.044
The genre?

667
00:55:24.586 --> 00:55:25.754
I'm not so sure.

668
00:55:28.006 --> 00:55:30.050
Where do you get your ideas?

669
00:55:31.301 --> 00:55:33.721
Before, from the wonder of the night.

670
00:55:37.099 --> 00:55:39.226
Now, from the foul taste of morning.

671
00:55:49.862 --> 00:55:52.239
Remind me to get a shot before sunset.

672
00:55:52.948 --> 00:55:56.243
If you forget,
I have millions of all these cliffs.


673
00:56:01.290 --> 00:56:03.041
I'd like to tell you a story.

674
00:56:07.087 --> 00:56:08.547
A story no one ever told.

675
00:56:09.757 --> 00:56:10.841
I love secrets.

676
00:56:11.967 --> 00:56:14.553
It's complicated.
I'll try to keep it short.


677
00:56:16.263 --> 00:56:19.558
At the end,
you'll get why I'm telling it. Me too.


678
00:56:20.684 --> 00:56:23.812
I did my military service
on a mountaintop


679
00:56:23.896 --> 00:56:25.773
on the Syria
-Lebanon border.

680
00:56:25.856 --> 00:56:27.483
When we occupied Lebanon,

681
00:56:28.317 --> 00:56:30.027
Mom asked me to say I was gay.

682
00:56:30.778 --> 00:56:32.738
Back then, homosexuals were exempted.

683
00:56:32.821 --> 00:56:35.240
I'm not gay. Unfortunately, perhaps.

684
00:56:35.324 --> 00:56:36.658
Wronged by women?

685
00:56:36.742 --> 00:56:39.703
I wanted to be a hero,
dreamed of a commando unit.


686
00:56:39.787 --> 00:56:41.830
A health issue disqualified me.

687
00:56:42.706 --> 00:56:44.124
It broke my heart.

688
00:56:45.375 --> 00:56:48.295
No later failure in movies
hurt so much.


689
00:56:50.756 --> 00:56:52.216
Anyway, keep it short.

690
00:56:52.925 --> 00:56:55.177
I wound up in an intelligence unit.

691
00:56:55.260 --> 00:56:57.513
15 of us. Only men, no women.

692
00:56:57.888 --> 00:56:59.097
None. Ever.

693
00:56:59.515 --> 00:57:03.769
Hearing the voice of the plump secretary
of a general dropping in,


694
00:57:03.852 --> 00:57:05.854
we'd charge into the corridor.

695
00:57:06.355 --> 00:57:08.774
We craved women
and we'll never be sated.


696
00:57:09.733 --> 00:57:11.401
Every two weeks,

697
00:57:11.485 --> 00:57:12.820
on holy Friday,

698
00:57:13.403 --> 00:57:16.573
if there was no emergency or alert,
we would dance.


699
00:57:16.657 --> 00:57:18.992
Ten guys in an empty room.

700
00:57:19.076 --> 00:57:21.787
And a photo of the
Dead Sea on the wall!

701
00:58:03.537 --> 00:58:05.914
<i>We're the murderers of ancient times!</i>

702
00:58:05.998 --> 00:58:08.625
<i>We're the empire of eternity!
The kingdom!</i>


703
00:59:58.235 --> 01:00:00.946
We lived in burrows in the mountain.

704
01:00:01.029 --> 01:00:03.699
We'd sworn to protect pointless secrets.

705
01:00:03.782 --> 01:00:05.784
I arrived at the same time as...

706
01:00:05.867 --> 01:00:07.494
Damn! Ants in winter!

707
01:00:08.495 --> 01:00:11.039
At the same time as this other soldier.

708
01:00:11.665 --> 01:00:14.751
You see?
I'd asked for a dangerous posting.


709
01:00:14.835 --> 01:00:16.420
I was looking for adventure.

710
01:00:16.503 --> 01:00:18.296
I felt like I was a cowboy.

711
01:00:18.880 --> 01:00:21.508
I've no idea how he ended up there.

712
01:00:22.009 --> 01:00:25.679
Just before, a guy jumped to his death
from an antenna tower.


713
01:00:25.762 --> 01:00:27.222
Three months later,

714
01:00:27.305 --> 01:00:31.101
the cook cut his own throat
with a razor, screaming,


715
01:00:31.184 --> 01:00:33.437
"Mom! I'm building the Temple!"

716
01:00:33.937 --> 01:00:35.397
Anyway, keep it short.

717
01:00:35.897 --> 01:00:38.692
As new recruits,
obviously we got hazed.


718
01:00:39.026 --> 01:00:40.360
Standard humiliations.

719
01:00:40.444 --> 01:00:43.780
Licking armpits, earlobes,
boot soles, belly buttons.


720
01:00:43.864 --> 01:00:47.159
Two guys hold you,
a third rams his dick in your ear.


721
01:00:47.242 --> 01:00:48.243
Keep it short.

722
01:00:48.326 --> 01:00:50.454
It was tense with the Syrians.

723
01:00:50.537 --> 01:00:53.373
Later, it turned out,
it was a complete fraud.


724
01:00:53.457 --> 01:00:56.251
A Mossad agent dreamed up a war
to keep his job.


725
01:00:56.334 --> 01:00:59.838
Most likely, he felt old and irrelevant,

726
01:00:59.921 --> 01:01:03.341
wanted to show
he could still do something big.


727
01:01:03.425 --> 01:01:04.718
Like a war.

728
01:01:06.928 --> 01:01:07.763
I get that.

729
01:01:10.265 --> 01:01:11.224
Come on!

730
01:01:13.226 --> 01:01:14.186
Again!

731
01:01:16.104 --> 01:01:19.191
<i>20,000 Syrian rifles trained on us
around the clock.</i>


732
01:01:19.274 --> 01:01:21.318
<i>Or so we were led to believe.</i>

733
01:01:21.401 --> 01:01:25.697
<i>The Syrian army was our worst nightmare.
Commandos, gruesome torture...</i>


734
01:01:25.781 --> 01:01:26.782
<i>Chairs</i>

735
01:01:26.865 --> 01:01:29.159
that snap your spine
vertebra by vertebra.


736
01:01:30.285 --> 01:01:31.286
You understand?

737
01:01:31.661 --> 01:01:32.996
It was long ago,

738
01:01:33.080 --> 01:01:35.499
well before their civil war and all that.

739
01:01:35.957 --> 01:01:38.335
I'm labeled a young director
but I'm old.


740
01:01:40.128 --> 01:01:41.296
Keep it short.

741
01:01:41.797 --> 01:01:43.423
The evening of our arrival

742
01:01:45.133 --> 01:01:46.843
they called the two newbies

743
01:01:47.427 --> 01:01:48.845
to one of the bunkers.

744
01:01:49.721 --> 01:01:51.640
We crawled through narrow tunnels.

745
01:01:53.141 --> 01:01:54.726
<i>We were sad and lost.</i>

746
01:01:55.894 --> 01:01:56.978
<i>Especially him.</i>

747
01:02:04.361 --> 01:02:06.029
<i>Ever hear of the singing officer?</i>

748
01:02:07.072 --> 01:02:07.989
No.

749
01:02:08.073 --> 01:02:09.241
Sounds like a book.

750
01:02:11.159 --> 01:02:12.119
The singing officer.

751
01:02:12.994 --> 01:02:15.997
<i>An intelligence officer
during the Yom Kippur war,</i>


752
01:02:16.081 --> 01:02:18.166
<i>captured by the Syrians.</i>

753
01:02:18.250 --> 01:02:19.918
<i>He had a phenomenal memory.</i>

754
01:02:20.001 --> 01:02:22.504
<i>I did too, but time shows no mercy.</i>

755
01:02:22.587 --> 01:02:26.508
<i>Legend has it, when they pressed
an empty pistol to his head,</i>


756
01:02:26.591 --> 01:02:29.010
<i>he cracked, spilled all our secrets.</i>

757
01:02:29.094 --> 01:02:32.597
<i>He showed off with his memory,
enjoyed impressing them.</i>


758
01:02:33.140 --> 01:02:34.266
<i>Keep it short.</i>

759
01:02:34.349 --> 01:02:36.685
<i>On his return,
he was accused of treason.</i>


760
01:02:37.519 --> 01:02:40.605
<i>At a remembrance ceremony,
someone spat in his face.</i>


761
01:02:46.778 --> 01:02:48.155
You have combat trauma?

762
01:02:49.698 --> 01:02:50.866
What combat?

763
01:03:04.212 --> 01:03:05.505
See that Syrian village?

764
01:03:06.506 --> 01:03:09.050
One day,
Israeli soldiers will buy cheese


765
01:03:09.134 --> 01:03:10.594
from the village store.

766
01:03:12.679 --> 01:03:15.473
But before,
guys even younger than you will die.


767
01:03:22.647 --> 01:03:23.982
This is cyanide.

768
01:03:25.567 --> 01:03:27.819
We all carry it in our pockets.

769
01:03:29.738 --> 01:03:32.073
For the Last Judgment procedure,

770
01:03:32.449 --> 01:03:34.367
when Syrians are scaling the walls,

771
01:03:35.243 --> 01:03:37.204
when it's captivity or death.

772
01:03:38.747 --> 01:03:40.248
Here, we choose death.

773
01:03:41.875 --> 01:03:44.419
We'll all take our cyanide pill.

774
01:03:44.920 --> 01:03:46.504
One after the other.

775
01:03:48.089 --> 01:03:49.799
Nobody will duck out.

776
01:04:18.453 --> 01:04:21.289
Where's the form you want me to sign?

777
01:04:21.873 --> 01:04:23.166
I need to get paid.

778
01:04:24.918 --> 01:04:26.753
Good thing you reminded me.

779
01:04:39.683 --> 01:04:42.978
Stop by the theater, will you?
Check the sound's loud.


780
01:04:49.442 --> 01:04:52.988
But open and shut the door
nice and gently.


781
01:04:53.363 --> 01:04:54.739
Don't let it slam.

782
01:05:26.062 --> 01:05:27.188
Hi, Mom.

783
01:05:28.606 --> 01:05:30.442
This is the Arava before sunset.

784
01:05:33.945 --> 01:05:37.240
We drove through a field
of rotting bell peppers.


785
01:05:38.033 --> 01:05:39.492
I wanted to film it for you.

786
01:05:41.661 --> 01:05:42.871
Just think,

787
01:05:42.954 --> 01:05:45.790
heaps of rotting peppers
in the desert.


788
01:05:47.292 --> 01:05:49.210
A metaphor for this country.

789
01:05:50.587 --> 01:05:53.298
We were driving too fast
to film it properly.


790
01:05:53.381 --> 01:05:54.591
So just imagine.

791
01:05:57.510 --> 01:06:00.930
Maybe we could use it
as the start of a story.


792
01:06:01.014 --> 01:06:02.432
Think it over, Mom.

793
01:06:03.850 --> 01:06:05.769
The screening is in progress.

794
01:06:07.354 --> 01:06:08.813
The dance scene, maybe.

795
01:06:11.941 --> 01:06:13.151
Have a good evening.

796
01:06:14.986 --> 01:06:16.780
Take half a sleeping pill.

797
01:06:18.073 --> 01:06:19.366
You are my treasure.

798
01:06:44.641 --> 01:06:47.852
Recording Yahalom David,
deputy director, libraries.


799
01:06:48.895 --> 01:06:51.356
Sapir Village, December 15.

800
01:06:51.898 --> 01:06:53.108
5:45 pm.

801
01:06:56.027 --> 01:06:58.321
Ignore the start of the recording.

802
01:07:05.912 --> 01:07:08.665
Any beautiful animals
worth shooting around here?


803
01:07:08.748 --> 01:07:09.749
Besides me?

804
01:07:09.833 --> 01:07:12.043
Bobcats, caracals, wolves, jackals,

805
01:07:12.127 --> 01:07:13.962
ugly striped hyenas,

806
01:07:14.045 --> 01:07:15.839
antelopes, crocodile farms...

807
01:07:15.922 --> 01:07:18.091
- The farm only opens in summer.
- Gazelles?


808
01:07:18.842 --> 01:07:20.969
Sign and we'll go looking for gazelles.

809
01:07:23.555 --> 01:07:24.764
Here, a pen.

810
01:07:24.848 --> 01:07:25.974
Wait!

811
01:07:26.057 --> 01:07:28.685
A week, 10 days,
after they gave us cyanide,


812
01:07:28.768 --> 01:07:31.604
screaming woke us up,
me and the other rookie.


813
01:07:32.647 --> 01:07:34.399
"To the bunker! 
To the bunker!"

814
01:07:38.069 --> 01:07:39.529
<i>The darkened tunnels.</i>

815
01:07:40.029 --> 01:07:41.156
<i>All is black.</i>

816
01:07:41.239 --> 01:07:43.283
<i>Three times, my head bangs on rocks.</i>

817
01:07:43.950 --> 01:07:45.994
<i>"Don't be scared," I tell him.</i>

818
01:07:47.662 --> 01:07:48.913
It didn't help.

819
01:07:57.422 --> 01:07:59.382
<i>Horrifying reports start coming in.</i>

820
01:08:00.258 --> 01:08:02.260
<i>Syrian tanks headed our way.</i>

821
01:08:02.969 --> 01:08:06.306
<i>Airborne commandos
swarming over the mountain.</i>


822
01:08:06.389 --> 01:08:08.933
<i>More commandos converging from Lebanon.</i>

823
01:08:09.893 --> 01:08:10.977
<i>Think about it.</i>

824
01:08:11.769 --> 01:08:15.398
Eyes wide open, like
a storm on the ocean,

825
01:08:15.482 --> 01:08:17.025
or I don't know what.

826
01:08:17.609 --> 01:08:20.612
Faces as white as sheets on a line.

827
01:08:21.946 --> 01:08:22.906
Imagine it.

828
01:08:24.115 --> 01:08:25.200
Imagine it.

829
01:08:55.813 --> 01:08:58.983
<i>We call for help
but the Israeli army is fast asleep.</i>


830
01:08:59.526 --> 01:09:01.861
Keep it short.
It dragged on an hour.


831
01:09:02.946 --> 01:09:05.865
<i>The sergeant's arrogance
gives way to fear.</i>


832
01:09:06.282 --> 01:09:09.244
<i>He receives orders over the radio
and falls silent.</i>


833
01:09:10.537 --> 01:09:12.247
<i>His eyes bug out.</i>

834
01:09:20.088 --> 01:09:22.131
Last Judgment!

835
01:09:47.323 --> 01:09:49.742
<i>One guy tries to protest.</i>

836
01:09:49.826 --> 01:09:52.704
<i>Let's run, he says,
but we know we're surrounded.</i>


837
01:09:58.710 --> 01:10:00.003
They shut him up.

838
01:10:04.799 --> 01:10:06.134
How come you're here?

839
01:10:08.469 --> 01:10:09.470
A miracle?

840
01:13:33.132 --> 01:13:34.091
I can't.

841
01:13:44.811 --> 01:13:46.604
- I can't.
- Swallow.


842
01:13:52.735 --> 01:13:54.445
- I can't.
- Swallow.


843
01:14:01.077 --> 01:14:02.161
Swallow.

844
01:14:04.664 --> 01:14:05.873
Swallow!

845
01:14:18.678 --> 01:14:19.720
Swallow!

846
01:14:26.435 --> 01:14:27.937
Poor guy, how awful.

847
01:14:28.020 --> 01:14:29.063
Wait...

848
01:14:31.107 --> 01:14:32.108
Shoot me!

849
01:14:33.943 --> 01:14:35.027
You shoot me!

850
01:14:42.076 --> 01:14:43.411
Grab that idiot!

851
01:14:44.495 --> 01:14:47.331
The war, cyanide, it's all a joke.
There's nothing.


852
01:14:47.415 --> 01:14:48.499
I know.

853
01:15:00.595 --> 01:15:01.679
Unbelievable!

854
01:15:03.139 --> 01:15:04.140
How cruel!

855
01:15:04.223 --> 01:15:07.226
What a scumbag, that sergeant.
A real bastard!


856
01:15:07.310 --> 01:15:11.564
The weirdest thing is,
I saw right away he was lying.


857
01:15:11.647 --> 01:15:12.940
They were all lying.

858
01:15:13.524 --> 01:15:14.692
How did you know?

859
01:15:14.775 --> 01:15:16.360
They were terrible actors.

860
01:15:16.819 --> 01:15:20.489
Especially the guy running the thing.
The sergeant.


861
01:15:21.032 --> 01:15:23.534
We found out later,
it was all his idea.

862
01:15:24.243 --> 01:15:26.037
On the radio, he was like,

863
01:15:26.120 --> 01:15:28.998
"How many? Thousands?
Coming up the valley?


864
01:15:29.081 --> 01:15:30.541
Another chopper's landed?"

865
01:15:30.875 --> 01:15:33.085
I could tell it was to no one.

866
01:15:33.169 --> 01:15:34.837
The rhythm was off.

867
01:15:35.671 --> 01:15:36.756
Too rapid.

868
01:15:37.131 --> 01:15:39.508
He couldn't stand the slowness of truth.

869
01:15:40.134 --> 01:15:43.262
"Heart-broken, 
I must tell you,

870
01:15:43.596 --> 01:15:45.264
"Last Judgment!"

871
01:15:45.348 --> 01:15:46.641
I nearly cracked up.

872
01:15:46.724 --> 01:15:50.603
And taking the so-called cyanide,
the way he swallowed.


873
01:15:50.686 --> 01:15:52.939
The way he yelled, "Swallow! Swallow!"

874
01:15:54.231 --> 01:15:55.566
I wasn't buying it.

875
01:15:58.194 --> 01:16:00.738
I did secretarial work at a missile base.

876
01:16:01.447 --> 01:16:04.700
From my office window, 
I saw a fence.

877
01:16:05.576 --> 01:16:06.702
Totally pointless.

878
01:16:08.955 --> 01:16:11.165
At least, you got stories out of it.

879
01:16:11.248 --> 01:16:13.668
We all have stories
but you celebrate yours.


880
01:16:16.253 --> 01:16:19.006
Actually, your story reminds me
of a book I read.


881
01:16:19.882 --> 01:16:21.384
It's very similar.

882
01:16:22.301 --> 01:16:24.470
About the Foreign Legion, maybe.

883
01:16:25.137 --> 01:16:26.222
In Africa?

884
01:16:26.597 --> 01:16:28.099
A two-word title.

885
01:16:37.066 --> 01:16:38.192
Name.

886
01:16:38.275 --> 01:16:41.237
Date, title, copyright holder.

887
01:16:41.696 --> 01:16:45.116
Role in the production.
Writer-director, right?


888
01:16:45.199 --> 01:16:47.201
Co-writer? Your mother?

889
01:16:47.284 --> 01:16:48.369
Wait.

890
01:16:50.079 --> 01:16:52.039
Don't you have any questions?

891
01:16:52.665 --> 01:16:55.167
My story needs no further explanation?

892
01:16:59.839 --> 01:17:02.800
Something crossed my mind.
Maybe you won't like it.


893
01:17:05.302 --> 01:17:09.056
If you knew it was a game,
why let them torment the guy?


894
01:17:09.140 --> 01:17:10.808
You could've spoken out.

895
01:17:12.685 --> 01:17:14.145
I guess it's easy now,

896
01:17:14.562 --> 01:17:15.896
I wasn't there.

897
01:17:16.564 --> 01:17:18.024
I was there, though.

898
01:17:19.442 --> 01:17:22.695
I was wise to their game, not scared.
Just the opposite.


899
01:17:23.779 --> 01:17:27.616
I hated the sergeant
and his buddies in the unit.


900
01:17:28.617 --> 01:17:30.911
I didn't want to help, just the opposite.

901
01:17:30.995 --> 01:17:32.038
Destroy everything.

902
01:17:32.538 --> 01:17:33.497
Always.

903
01:17:33.831 --> 01:17:35.291
So why do nothing?

904
01:17:35.374 --> 01:17:39.211
Why did I let it go on and on?
Why play along?


905
01:17:39.670 --> 01:17:41.630
I could've taught them a lesson.

906
01:17:41.714 --> 01:17:44.508
Demolished years of abuse in a second.

907
01:17:46.052 --> 01:17:47.678
But I swallowed the cyanide.

908
01:17:49.013 --> 01:17:51.307
So, before I swallow this pill,

909
01:17:52.850 --> 01:17:55.186
tell me what I'm really signing.

910
01:17:56.479 --> 01:17:59.106
It's your agreement with the Ministry...

911
01:17:59.190 --> 01:18:00.232
No, wrong.

912
01:18:02.818 --> 01:18:05.654
You specify the nature
of the cultural activity...


913
01:18:05.738 --> 01:18:06.739
No.

914
01:18:08.449 --> 01:18:10.618
- I don't know what to say.
- The truth.


915
01:18:12.369 --> 01:18:14.663
I'm part of the Ministry, the system.

916
01:18:14.747 --> 01:18:16.123
Read what it says.

917
01:18:18.793 --> 01:18:20.586
- Read it?
- Go ahead.


918
01:18:27.343 --> 01:18:29.845
"Activity description:
public meeting with..."


919
01:18:29.929 --> 01:18:31.097
Skip that, please.

920
01:18:33.099 --> 01:18:36.602
"Once the activity is completed,
the invoice will be..."


921
01:18:36.685 --> 01:18:37.645
Come on.

922
01:18:38.896 --> 01:18:40.064
"Confidentiality.

923
01:18:40.606 --> 01:18:42.733
"You must respect the copy..."

924
01:18:42.817 --> 01:18:45.444
Copyright.
Come on. "Activity topics."


925
01:18:48.614 --> 01:18:52.118
"Check activity topics
from the following list:


926
01:18:55.663 --> 01:18:56.997
"The Jewish experience,

927
01:18:57.081 --> 01:19:00.042
"cultural diversity in Israel,
likeness and difference,


928
01:19:00.126 --> 01:19:02.211
"Jewish identity,

"landscapes and places,

"Jewish diaspora, anti

931
01:19:06.298 --> 01:19:08.551
"ethnicity in Israel, Zionism."

932
01:19:08.634 --> 01:19:09.718
More, more.

933
01:19:11.095 --> 01:19:13.013
"Desert and sea, men and women,

934
01:19:13.097 --> 01:19:16.600
"Jewish holidays, childhood,
sports, favorite singers,


935

936

937
01:19:21.522 --> 01:19:22.439
"the Army.

01:19:22.523 --> 01:19:25.860
"If none of the above topics
are applicable,


939
01:19:25.943 --> 01:19:30.197
"please specify your subject
and angle of approach."


940
01:19:30.281 --> 01:19:31.490
What do you think?

941
01:19:32.199 --> 01:19:33.367
I already told you.

942
01:19:35.327 --> 01:19:36.370
So?

943
01:19:37.163 --> 01:19:38.998
These requirements are new.

944
01:19:39.081 --> 01:19:40.916
Instead of local libraries,

945
01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:44.295
all this is now run
by the Ministry's libraries division.


946
01:19:44.378 --> 01:19:45.880
- You.
- I'm the deputy.


947
01:19:46.255 --> 01:19:49.300
You receive the forms
and approve or reject them.


948
01:19:49.383 --> 01:19:50.301
No.

949
01:19:50.634 --> 01:19:53.095
Not me.
We follow the instructions we're given.


950
01:19:53.179 --> 01:19:54.221
By whom?

951
01:19:55.306 --> 01:19:57.141
The minister and chief of staff.

952
01:19:57.224 --> 01:19:58.475
Which instructions?

953
01:20:02.980 --> 01:20:04.064
Come on!

954
01:20:04.607 --> 01:20:07.067
We're losing the light,
as we say on film sets.


955
01:20:12.072 --> 01:20:16.076
Not to approve exhibition of works,
or invitations to artists,


956
01:20:16.160 --> 01:20:18.245
that deal with inappropriate...

957
01:20:18.329 --> 01:20:21.373
What's inappropriate?
Inappropriate, says who?


958
01:20:23.292 --> 01:20:24.919
We do. The Ministry.

959
01:20:26.462 --> 01:20:27.796
I'll rephrase it.

960
01:20:28.297 --> 01:20:33.719
Suppose I want to discuss a nationalist,
racist, sadistic, abject Jewish state,


961
01:20:33.802 --> 01:20:38.265
whose sole aim is to reduce the soul,
particularly the Arab soul,


962
01:20:38.349 --> 01:20:40.935
to impotence and incompetence,

963
01:20:41.018 --> 01:20:43.520
so it collapses
under the state's oppression


964
01:20:43.604 --> 01:20:46.023
and will be completely at its mercy.

965
01:20:46.106 --> 01:20:50.945
A state that is a deadly, congenital
or contagious disease for its citizens.


966
01:20:51.320 --> 01:20:53.322
You'd be rejected and blacklisted.

967
01:20:53.405 --> 01:20:57.117
What if the topic is Israelis,
in their bestial ignorance,


968
01:20:57.201 --> 01:20:59.453
blind puppets, wretched creatures,

969
01:20:59.536 --> 01:21:02.414
who torment anybody different from them,

970
01:21:02.498 --> 01:21:06.293
and who are obsessed
with their possessions and...


971
01:21:06.377 --> 01:21:07.336
Enough!

972
01:21:07.419 --> 01:21:08.337
Hold on!

973
01:21:08.420 --> 01:21:13.217
Any glimmer of light in them
was extinguished by their schools,


974
01:21:13.300 --> 01:21:16.053
which commit crimes
against their own students,


975
01:21:16.136 --> 01:21:19.765
which murder their spirit
and exterminate their soul.


976
01:21:20.140 --> 01:21:21.058
Exterminate...

977
01:21:21.141 --> 01:21:23.686
Which spew out impenetrable spite.

978
01:21:23.769 --> 01:21:25.646
Syllabus as mental illness!

979
01:21:25.729 --> 01:21:30.067
And the parents,
who are also terrible ignoramuses,


980
01:21:30.150 --> 01:21:33.487
totally innocent
since no one ever opened their eyes.


981
01:21:33.570 --> 01:21:34.738
Just the opposite!

982
01:21:34.822 --> 01:21:37.533
You'll be blacklisted,
if you want to know.


983
01:21:37.616 --> 01:21:38.951
I want the truth.

984
01:21:39.034 --> 01:21:40.536
Truly, it's what we'd do.

985
01:21:41.287 --> 01:21:43.247
What if my topic is a state

986
01:21:43.330 --> 01:21:45.833
that vomits out
whatever doesn't conform


987
01:21:45.916 --> 01:21:47.918
and never takes it back?

988
01:21:48.002 --> 01:21:51.088
That brutalizes its victims
with deepest baseness,


989
01:21:51.171 --> 01:21:53.382
and sometimes even deeper.

990
01:21:53.465 --> 01:21:56.176
Whose morality is a complete fraud,

991
01:21:56.260 --> 01:21:58.887
and to say otherwise
would be a lie...


992
01:21:58.971 --> 01:22:00.556
You can tell me but not...

993
01:22:00.639 --> 01:22:01.640
I say,

994
01:22:01.724 --> 01:22:05.436
"A Jewish, nationalistic, racist state."

995
01:22:05.519 --> 01:22:09.440
And they retort, "Not in Israel.
And if so, there's no harm in it.


996
01:22:09.523 --> 01:22:13.527
"For the land of Israel is beauty,
and its people is worthy."


997
01:22:13.610 --> 01:22:15.863
But beyond their empty rhetoric,

998
01:22:15.946 --> 01:22:18.782
the true nature of the country's rulers
is revealed.


999
01:22:18.866 --> 01:22:20.284
Including your minister!

1000
01:22:20.701 --> 01:22:24.288
So cowardly, so vulgar, so grotesque.

1001
01:22:24.371 --> 01:22:27.791
Their despicable laws prevent fresh air

1002
01:22:27.875 --> 01:22:30.044
from penetrating people's brains.

1003
01:22:30.127 --> 01:22:33.547
Then those rulers,
behind their nationalist exhortations,


1004
01:22:33.630 --> 01:22:35.299
can easily tyrannize.

1005
01:22:35.841 --> 01:22:40.095
Just ask 2, 3 or 4 questions
and demand answers


1006
01:22:40.179 --> 01:22:42.181
to expose their abhorrent fraud.

1007
01:22:42.264 --> 01:22:43.932
I don't want a debate but...

1008
01:22:44.016 --> 01:22:47.811
They shut people's eyes
so they forget there's not one people,


1009
01:22:47.895 --> 01:22:49.646
there are a million people.

1010
01:22:49.730 --> 01:22:52.316
Not one country but a million countries.

1011
01:22:52.399 --> 01:22:56.195
Each of them, Yahalom,
is beautiful and important.


1012
01:22:56.278 --> 01:22:58.864
The universe bubbles over
with strange beauty.


1013
01:22:58.947 --> 01:23:02.701
Just read the books
you probably have in your library.


1014
01:23:03.410 --> 01:23:04.536
Jules Verne?

1015
01:23:06.163 --> 01:23:07.164
Dickens?

1016
01:23:08.916 --> 01:23:10.084
Dostoyevsky?

1017
01:23:10.876 --> 01:23:11.877
Kafka?

1018
01:23:13.295 --> 01:23:14.546
Edgar Allan Poe?

1019
01:23:14.630 --> 01:23:15.714
George Sand?

1020
01:23:16.382 --> 01:23:18.384
They hide all that from their people,

1021
01:23:18.467 --> 01:23:22.179
who think, in their ignorance,
the universe begins and ends


1022
01:23:22.262 --> 01:23:24.515
in the cage where they live and die.

1023
01:23:27.893 --> 01:23:31.146
Say a fraction of that and you're through.
No need for...


1024
01:23:31.230 --> 01:23:32.231
Secrets?

1025
01:23:32.689 --> 01:23:34.983
Military secrets? 
State secrets?

1026
01:23:35.526 --> 01:23:38.237
Do we have bombs of a type...

1027
01:23:40.864 --> 01:23:41.949
How many?

1028
01:23:44.284 --> 01:23:45.619
At least!

1029
01:23:45.702 --> 01:23:46.662
Where?

1030
01:23:47.037 --> 01:23:47.955
Here.

1031
01:23:48.038 --> 01:23:49.540
Straight on, straight on!

1032
01:23:50.249 --> 01:23:52.084
On asphalt, on sand!

1033
01:23:52.543 --> 01:23:54.211
Raise the hem of your dress.

1034
01:23:54.294 --> 01:23:57.214
The road goes through the mud of hell.

1035
01:23:57.297 --> 01:23:59.049
At the main intersection,

1036
01:23:59.133 --> 01:24:00.509
hurry, hurry!

1037
01:24:01.135 --> 01:24:02.428
Bastards coming through!

1038
01:24:03.137 --> 01:24:04.513
I'm a bastard, too!

1039
01:24:04.930 --> 01:24:06.432
Straight on, straight on!

1040
01:24:08.267 --> 01:24:10.436
- Here! In the desert...
- Not here but...


1041
01:24:10.519 --> 01:24:12.646
A new generation is rising.

1042
01:24:13.105 --> 01:24:15.274
It grows but doesn't bloom.

1043
01:24:15.357 --> 01:24:16.567
It wilts.

1044
01:24:16.650 --> 01:24:18.652
It rots before buds appear.

1045
01:24:18.735 --> 01:24:21.697
Instead of shucking off
earlier generations,


1046
01:24:21.780 --> 01:24:24.074
it wallows in its own vileness.

1047
01:24:24.158 --> 01:24:25.075
Vulgar!

1048
01:24:25.159 --> 01:24:26.076
Ignorant!

1049
01:24:26.160 --> 01:24:27.077
Cowardly!

1050
01:24:27.161 --> 01:24:29.246
Worse than those that went before.

1051
01:24:29.329 --> 01:24:31.498
Each generation here is the worst.

1052
01:24:31.582 --> 01:24:34.877
And each one
produces a generation even worse still.


1053
01:24:34.960 --> 01:24:37.296
Every day, monsters will be born here!

1054
01:24:37.963 --> 01:24:40.215
- I'm not saying a word...
- Jerusalem?


1055
01:24:40.757 --> 01:24:42.259
Is Jerusalem a topic?

1056
01:24:42.342 --> 01:24:43.427
Is it or not?

1057
01:24:43.844 --> 01:24:45.762
I'd love to film Jerusalem.

1058
01:24:45.846 --> 01:24:49.016
Sing the praises of its monstrous charm.

1059
01:24:49.099 --> 01:24:50.517
A land killing its own!

1060
01:24:51.185 --> 01:24:52.978
Putrid historical garbage!

1061
01:24:53.520 --> 01:24:56.106
Hideous inhabitants
living in hideous beauty.


1062
01:24:56.190 --> 01:24:58.275
Over time, they become malicious.

1063
01:24:58.734 --> 01:25:01.570
Yet in that city of death,
I feel at home.


1064
01:25:01.653 --> 01:25:04.990
I wish I could say
it had no ties to me.

1065
01:25:05.073 --> 01:25:07.326
For I want no ties to it.

1066
01:25:07.409 --> 01:25:10.204
But we're tied by an unbreakable bond!

1067
01:25:10.829 --> 01:25:13.290
That truth will drag me down to hell.

1068
01:25:14.458 --> 01:25:18.086
Puke Israel out of me with a scream,

1069
01:25:18.170 --> 01:25:19.838
straight into the face...

1070
01:25:19.922 --> 01:25:23.467
Into the face of your minister of culture!

1071
01:25:24.092 --> 01:25:27.679
Deranged by malice,
he'll crawl on all fours!


1072
01:25:27.763 --> 01:25:30.432
Like a cow, he'll graze...

1073
01:25:43.403 --> 01:25:44.655
It will soon pass.

1074
01:25:53.288 --> 01:25:54.373
Well?

1075
01:25:58.335 --> 01:25:59.378
Well what?

1076
01:26:00.379 --> 01:26:02.172
What will you do to me?

1077
01:26:03.757 --> 01:26:04.883
We'll reject you.

1078
01:26:05.300 --> 01:26:06.218
And?

1079
01:26:06.301 --> 01:26:07.761
And report you.

1080
01:26:07.844 --> 01:26:08.845
So?

1081
01:26:09.388 --> 01:26:10.806
So you'll be done.

1082
01:26:11.598 --> 01:26:12.975
Labeled a traitor even.

1083
01:26:14.434 --> 01:26:15.602
Perhaps.

1084
01:26:15.686 --> 01:26:18.438
Finished, destroyed, crushed.

1085
01:26:18.522 --> 01:26:19.648
Perhaps.

1086
01:26:21.191 --> 01:26:22.484
Don't hide. Say it!

1087
01:26:24.861 --> 01:26:25.946
I'm no echo.

1088
01:26:26.029 --> 01:26:27.030
It's the truth.

1089
01:26:28.615 --> 01:26:29.783
It's the truth.

1090
01:26:30.158 --> 01:26:31.868
It's the truth, it's the truth.

1091
01:26:42.504 --> 01:26:45.132
You'll be finished, destroyed, crushed.

1092
01:26:46.508 --> 01:26:47.634
Who'll finish me?

1093
01:26:48.802 --> 01:26:50.470
Destroy me? Crush me?

1094
01:26:52.097 --> 01:26:53.724
The libraries division.

1095
01:26:54.182 --> 01:26:55.225
Us.

1096
01:26:56.518 --> 01:26:57.769
On whose orders?

1097
01:26:57.853 --> 01:26:59.021
The minister's.

1098
01:26:59.104 --> 01:27:02.524
He said, "Smear the country,
and you starve to death."


1099
01:27:03.734 --> 01:27:05.193
What do you think?

1100
01:27:05.861 --> 01:27:07.112
It's pathetic.

1101
01:27:09.698 --> 01:27:10.616
Good.

1102
01:27:10.699 --> 01:27:12.367
He's a minister of the arts

1103
01:27:12.451 --> 01:27:13.869
who hates art.

1104
01:27:15.454 --> 01:27:16.580
Good.

1105
01:27:16.663 --> 01:27:19.416
In a government that hates human freedom.

1106
01:27:19.499 --> 01:27:20.500
Say it.

1107
01:27:20.584 --> 01:27:22.794
A minister of the arts who hates art

1108
01:27:22.878 --> 01:27:24.254
in a government...

1109
01:27:24.338 --> 01:27:25.631
I'm no parrot.

1110
01:27:25.714 --> 01:27:27.007
They're your own words.

1111
01:27:27.424 --> 01:27:29.384
If it means so much to you...

1112
01:27:30.802 --> 01:27:33.555
He's a minister of
the arts who hates art

1113
01:27:34.139 --> 01:27:36.016
in a government

1114
01:27:36.099 --> 01:27:38.018
that hates all human beauty.

1115
01:27:40.062 --> 01:27:42.022
The ugliest of governments.

1116
01:27:46.234 --> 01:27:47.277
I agree.

1117
01:27:57.621 --> 01:27:59.247
Give me the form, please.

1118
01:28:03.877 --> 01:28:05.045
And a pen?

1119
01:28:10.467 --> 01:28:11.802
What can I write on?

1120
01:28:23.730 --> 01:28:25.232
In topics for discussion...

1121
01:28:26.942 --> 01:28:27.776
I'm checking

1122
01:28:28.485 --> 01:28:29.695
Family,

1123
01:28:30.821 --> 01:28:31.822
Love,

1124
01:28:33.198 --> 01:28:34.199
and...

1125
01:28:37.619 --> 01:28:39.079
Comrades in arms.

1126
01:29:19.619 --> 01:29:20.704
Hi, Mom.

1127
01:29:22.706 --> 01:29:24.291
I'm here, far away.

1128
01:29:26.376 --> 01:29:27.794
And I can't decide.

1129
01:29:30.589 --> 01:29:32.382
If what I did was right.

1130
01:29:35.093 --> 01:29:37.596
I have no doubt what you'd have done.

1131
01:29:48.857 --> 01:29:51.860
I'm sending you
the last minute of today.


1132
01:30:36.446 --> 01:30:37.531
Come on, Y.

1133
01:30:39.074 --> 01:30:40.200
Come on.

1134
01:30:45.163 --> 01:30:47.457
Come on, Y, come on.

1135
01:31:33.962 --> 01:31:35.463
Soon you'll be on stage.

1136
01:31:40.010 --> 01:31:42.095
I have a question, but be honest.

1137
01:31:44.598 --> 01:31:47.601
In your cyanide story,
you weren't the guy who knew.


1138
01:31:47.684 --> 01:31:50.770
You were the sobbing one
who ran away. Right?


1139
01:31:54.691 --> 01:31:55.734
The victim?

1140
01:31:58.695 --> 01:32:01.239
Who didn't understand
and ran for his life?


1141
01:32:02.949 --> 01:32:05.785
You're the one who cried. 
I'm sure of it.

1142
01:32:06.620 --> 01:32:09.873
In the story, you run from yourself,
but it's in you.


1143
01:32:10.498 --> 01:32:11.625
I sense it.

1144
01:32:12.876 --> 01:32:13.919
The fear.

1145
01:32:14.002 --> 01:32:15.003
The despair.

1146
01:32:16.338 --> 01:32:17.756
It's in your films, too.

1147
01:32:18.882 --> 01:32:20.383
There's another option.

1148
01:32:21.301 --> 01:32:22.427
Which is?

1149
01:32:23.595 --> 01:32:26.348
That I was neither the hazed rookie...

1150
01:32:28.433 --> 01:32:29.893
nor the observer.

1151
01:32:33.772 --> 01:32:35.023
I was the sergeant.

1152
01:32:36.149 --> 01:32:37.442
The guy behind it all.

1153
01:32:40.528 --> 01:32:41.655
I am the devil.

1154
01:32:42.864 --> 01:32:43.990
The tormentor.

1155
01:33:12.018 --> 01:33:13.019
Good evening.

1156
01:33:19.359 --> 01:33:20.986
Anyone want to ask anything?

1157
01:33:27.283 --> 01:33:28.576
To say anything?

1158
01:33:33.289 --> 01:33:35.083
Did anyone think anything?

1159
01:33:35.166 --> 01:33:36.376
Did anyone think?

1160
01:33:41.381 --> 01:33:42.632
Thank you.

1161
01:33:43.591 --> 01:33:46.469
The baby in the film, is that you?

1162
01:33:49.222 --> 01:33:50.390
Or yours?

1163
01:33:50.974 --> 01:33:52.809
I'll never have children.

1164
01:33:52.892 --> 01:33:54.102
You have any?

1165
01:33:54.185 --> 01:33:56.104
Yes, I'm a mother of three.

1166
01:33:56.771 --> 01:33:58.064
Pleased to meet you.

1167
01:33:58.148 --> 01:34:01.026
I'm the enemy of families.
Hell's little darling.


1168
01:34:05.572 --> 01:34:08.700
My mother often says,
"There are no survivors here."


1169
01:34:09.451 --> 01:34:11.119
No survivors, my friends.

1170
01:34:11.202 --> 01:34:12.203
Not me.

1171
01:34:12.287 --> 01:34:13.288
Nor you.

1172
01:34:14.748 --> 01:34:16.583
I have something to tell you.

1173
01:34:16.666 --> 01:34:19.961
I'll shoot my next film soon.
<i>The Knee of Ahed Tamimi.</i>


1174
01:34:20.462 --> 01:34:23.465
You won't be able to see Ahed's knee

1175
01:34:23.548 --> 01:34:25.175
after it is shattered by a bullet.

1176
01:34:25.258 --> 01:34:27.510
As for <i>The Knee of Ahed Tamimi,</i>

1177
01:34:27.594 --> 01:34:29.763
you won't be able to see it here,

1178
01:34:29.846 --> 01:34:31.681
and most likely won't want to.

1179
01:34:31.765 --> 01:34:35.018
Maybe you too are sad
she wasn't shot in the knee.


1180
01:34:35.643 --> 01:34:37.187
You won't be able to see it

1181
01:34:37.604 --> 01:34:41.274
because to be here
to listen to you keep silent,


1182
01:34:41.357 --> 01:34:43.234
I had to fill out a form,

1183
01:34:43.735 --> 01:34:47.155
specifying the subject
of the film you just saw,


1184
01:34:47.238 --> 01:34:49.199
and of the subsequent discussion.

1185
01:34:50.283 --> 01:34:51.701
A form of submission.

1186
01:34:52.994 --> 01:34:54.162
Servility.

1187
01:34:55.288 --> 01:34:56.581
Humiliation.

1188
01:34:59.626 --> 01:35:02.670
You're thinking,
"How's this about the Arab's knee?


1189
01:35:02.754 --> 01:35:04.172
"He's exaggerating, lying.

1190
01:35:04.589 --> 01:35:06.341
"Damn right, shut him down."

1191
01:35:09.427 --> 01:35:10.845
Hear for yourselves.

1192
01:35:16.017 --> 01:35:18.478
<i>It's the truth,
it's the truth, it's the truth...</i>


1193
01:35:24.943 --> 01:35:27.028
<i>You'll be finished, destroyed, crushed.</i>

1194
01:35:27.445 --> 01:35:29.739
<i>- Who'll finish me?
- Us.</i>


1195
01:35:29.823 --> 01:35:31.324
<i>On the minister's orders.</i>

1196
01:35:33.076 --> 01:35:36.371
<i>He said, "Smear the country,
and you starve to death."</i>


1197
01:35:36.454 --> 01:35:37.914
<i>What do you think?</i>

1198
01:35:38.456 --> 01:35:39.582
<i>It's pathetic.</i>

1199
01:35:39.666 --> 01:35:40.625
<i>Good.</i>

1200
01:35:40.708 --> 01:35:43.461
<i>He's a minister of
the arts who hates art.</i>

1201
01:35:43.920 --> 01:35:45.004
<i>Say it.</i>

1202
01:35:45.088 --> 01:35:48.716
<i>"He's a minister of the arts
in a government that hates..."</i>


1203
01:35:48.800 --> 01:35:50.468
<i>- I'm no parrot.
- They're your words.</i>


1204
01:35:50.552 --> 01:35:51.678
What are you doing?

1205
01:35:51.761 --> 01:35:53.429
<i>If it means so much to you...</i>

1206
01:35:53.805 --> 01:35:56.808
<i>A minister of the arts who hates art</i>

1207
01:35:57.934 --> 01:36:00.603
<i>in a government that hates human beauty.</i>

1208
01:36:01.688 --> 01:36:03.565
<i>The ugliest of governments.</i>

1209
01:36:03.982 --> 01:36:05.191
<i>I agree.</i>

1210
01:36:06.526 --> 01:36:08.153
I have just sent that...

1211
01:36:08.236 --> 01:36:09.362
- Asshole!
- Coward!


1212
01:36:09.445 --> 01:36:12.323
...to the press,
TV, internet, everywhere!


1213
01:36:21.124 --> 01:36:22.584
You killed me, get it?

1214
01:36:23.168 --> 01:36:24.335
I'm finished!

1215
01:36:41.561 --> 01:36:42.604
Yahalom!

1216
01:37:35.490 --> 01:37:36.491
Stay back!

1217
01:37:40.453 --> 01:37:41.371
Yahalom!

1218
01:37:44.290 --> 01:37:45.416
Come back!

1219
01:37:46.793 --> 01:37:47.752
Stop!

1220
01:37:51.297 --> 01:37:52.382
- No, Yahalom.
- Back, Mom!


1221
01:37:52.465 --> 01:37:53.925
Your whole family's here.

1222
01:37:54.008 --> 01:37:55.343
We all love you.

1223
01:37:55.969 --> 01:37:58.596
You know how much we love you?

1224
01:37:58.680 --> 01:38:00.640
What's wrong, my child?

1225
01:38:00.723 --> 01:38:01.891
My life's over.

1226
01:38:03.810 --> 01:38:06.562
Silence!

1227
01:38:22.078 --> 01:38:23.413
Everybody's seen it?

1228
01:38:25.623 --> 01:38:27.125
The minister has tweeted.

1229
01:38:28.209 --> 01:38:29.460
Chief of staff, too.

1230
01:38:29.544 --> 01:38:30.878
Shut up, asshole!

1231
01:38:30.962 --> 01:38:33.381
Anything happens to her,
we'll fuck you up.


1232
01:38:33.464 --> 01:38:34.924
I'll rip you to shreds!

1233
01:38:35.008 --> 01:38:36.175
Stop, Dad!

1234
01:38:36.634 --> 01:38:37.844
Don't be vulgar!

1235
01:38:40.638 --> 01:38:41.723
I'll jump.

1236
01:38:43.516 --> 01:38:44.475
Don't jump.

1237
01:38:46.602 --> 01:38:47.603
Why not?

1238
01:38:50.648 --> 01:38:51.774
I'll jump.

1239
01:38:52.942 --> 01:38:54.193
I didn't send it.

1240
01:38:56.696 --> 01:38:58.072
I don't believe you.

1241
01:38:58.156 --> 01:38:59.449
Don't believe me.

1242
01:39:00.450 --> 01:39:01.534
Liar.

1243
01:39:05.246 --> 01:39:06.998
I didn't send it but I will.

1244
01:39:07.081 --> 01:39:08.708
Do it and we'll kill you!

1245
01:39:10.752 --> 01:39:11.836
Kill me.

1246
01:39:12.920 --> 01:39:15.089
Push me off right behind her.

1247
01:39:15.173 --> 01:39:16.382
Son of a bitch!

1248
01:39:16.466 --> 01:39:18.092
Haven't you hurt her enough?

1249
01:39:18.468 --> 01:39:20.636
You scum! You're scum and a coward!

1250
01:39:21.471 --> 01:39:23.306
Anyone comes close, I'll send it.

1251
01:39:28.061 --> 01:39:29.520
Could be, nobody cares.

1252
01:39:29.604 --> 01:39:30.646
Don't jump.

1253
01:39:33.775 --> 01:39:35.276
Delete it, please.

1254
01:39:36.444 --> 01:39:39.447
I appeal to your heart.
You want to destroy my life?


1255
01:39:40.573 --> 01:39:41.741
Like I give a shit.

1256
01:39:42.575 --> 01:39:45.828
You know what a scandalous life is?
And we're helpless.


1257
01:39:45.912 --> 01:39:47.538
You know what death is?

1258
01:39:47.955 --> 01:39:48.915
I'll jump.

1259
01:39:48.998 --> 01:39:49.999
Jump.

1260
01:39:50.083 --> 01:39:51.042
I'll die.

1261
01:39:51.125 --> 01:39:53.669
Smashed to a pulp. 
And us just after.

1262
01:39:53.753 --> 01:39:54.879
Please.

1263
01:40:03.513 --> 01:40:05.181
Please, let her go.

1264
01:40:09.560 --> 01:40:11.312
Let her go and take me.

1265
01:40:11.687 --> 01:40:13.564
I'll send it. Stay back.

1266
01:40:13.648 --> 01:40:14.690
Take me.

1267
01:40:18.236 --> 01:40:19.362
Leave her alone.

1268
01:40:21.280 --> 01:40:22.407
Take me.

1269
01:40:22.824 --> 01:40:24.158
What are you doing?

1270
01:40:25.159 --> 01:40:26.202
I want to.

1271
01:40:27.829 --> 01:40:29.622
Stay away from him, Narkis.

1272
01:40:29.705 --> 01:40:30.832
He's good.

1273
01:40:36.254 --> 01:40:37.296
You're good.

1274
01:40:41.426 --> 01:40:42.427
Enough.

1275
01:40:44.971 --> 01:40:46.180
Don't be angry.

1276
01:40:49.100 --> 01:40:50.309
You're good, not bad.

1277
01:40:53.938 --> 01:40:54.981
I know.

1278
01:40:57.984 --> 01:40:58.985
Go away.

1279
01:41:02.488 --> 01:41:03.656
Don't be angry.

1280
01:41:07.952 --> 01:41:09.620
Be good and you'll feel good.

1281
01:41:18.796 --> 01:41:19.964
You are good.

1282
01:41:23.050 --> 01:41:24.343
Everything will be fine.

1283
01:41:27.763 --> 01:41:28.890
You are good.

1284
01:41:33.686 --> 01:41:34.896
You are good.

1285
01:43:41.314 --> 01:43:42.815
I'm on my way home.

1286
01:43:45.443 --> 01:43:46.527
How are you today?

1287
01:43:48.696 --> 01:43:50.072
Able to stay strong?

1288
01:43:52.617 --> 01:43:54.493
Last night, there was the screening.

1289
01:43:56.162 --> 01:43:57.330
It wasn't bad.

1290
01:44:02.627 --> 01:44:04.378
You see all this, Mom?

1291
01:44:09.050 --> 01:44:12.136
Say goodbye to the land of Israel
through the clouds.
