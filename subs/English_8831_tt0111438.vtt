You're gonna give it to me.

You all remember Dr. Hans Kleindast,
the Nobel laureate...


32
00:04:54.351 --> 00:04:58.276
...who helped us during the space program?
For the past 20 years, he's been trying...

<i>...to keep his face off the cover
of TIME magazine, doing research.</i>


34
00:05:01.816 --> 00:05:04.444
His field of research has been time travel.

- I get the feeling he's gonna tell us.


38
00:05:13.828 --> 00:05:16.752
The funny thing is,
the good doctor actually did it.


39
00:05:21.211 --> 00:05:24.886
I thought that would get your attention.
That's right, he did it.


40

The technology's all in the folders in front
of you. You won't understand it.


41
00:05:29.135 --> 00:05:32.230
Now, you can't go forward,
because the future hasn't happened yet.


42
00:05:32.389 --> 00:05:35.484
However, you can go back,
and that's where things get real tricky.


43
00:05:35.642 --> 00:05:38.566
Turns out, if you go back
and change something, it's serious.


44
00:05:38.728 --> 00:05:41.572
It could be catastrophic.
Like throwing a stone in a lake...


45
00:05:41.731 --> 00:05:44.985
...and it causes ripples in the water.
Only, they're ripples in time.


46

So you can't go back and kill Hitler,
much as we'd all like to...


47
00:05:48.697 --> 00:05:51.246
...because it could cause
a chain reaction of events...


48
00:05:51.408 --> 00:05:54.332
...that could alter
or even destroy mankind.


49
00:05:54.494 --> 00:05:56.792
And that, my good senators,
is where you come in.


50
00:05:56.955 --> 00:05:59.504
We have to form
a brand-new covert agency...


51
00:05:59.666 --> 00:06:02.670
...to police this technology
and to actually protect time.


52
00:06:02.836 --> 00:06:05.931
It's gonna be called the Time Enforcement
Commission, or the T.E.C.


53
00:06:06.089 --> 00:06:09.593
This man is Commander Eugene Matuzak
of the Washington Police Department.


54
00:06:09.759 --> 00:06:11.978
He is our choice to run the commission.

55

How much is this gonna cost?

56
00:06:14.764 --> 00:06:16.607
- A lot.
- How much is a lot?


57
00:06:16.766 --> 00:06:18.768
More than a little
and less than too much.

58
00:06:18.935 --> 00:06:22.280
This is not a good time to ask for money.
You know, the economy--


59
00:06:22.439 --> 00:06:26.444
Suppose one of our foreign competitors
goes back in time and invents the computer?


60
00:06:26.609 --> 00:06:28.156
Or the airplane or automobile?

61
00:06:28.319 --> 00:06:30.697
Wanna talk about the state
of the American economy?


62
00:06:30.864 --> 00:06:34.334
How about this one? Saddam Hussein
finances a trip back to 1944.


63
00:06:34.492 --> 00:06:38.793
He gets our technology and Iraq becomes
the first country to have the atomic bomb.

- Oh, you like that one.
- Not bad.


65
00:06:41.958 --> 00:06:45.929
Try this one on for size. We think
there's already been a ripple. Ten days ago.


66
00:06:46.087 --> 00:06:49.682
CIA broke up an arms sale to Middle-Eastern
terrorists in Hamburg, Germany.


67
00:06:49.841 --> 00:06:53.516
That's happened before, so that news
doesn't come across the president's desk.


68
00:06:53.678 --> 00:06:57.353
What made this one different is that
the purchase was made with gold bullion.


69
00:06:57.515 --> 00:07:00.143
And the gold bullion was dated 1863
and stamped:


70
00:07:00.310 --> 00:07:03.154
Property of the Confederate States
of America.


71
00:07:03.313 --> 00:07:06.032
We had it carbon tested
and authenticated, and it's real.

Now, just think about what I'm saying.

73

Going back in time
is a pretty easy way to make money.


74
00:07:12.363 --> 00:07:16.243
Our committee would have
exclusive jurisdiction over this program?


75

Yours and yours alone, and no one
can know about this. It's too dangerous.

He said McComb
would go after his family.

He also said McComb
has half of the agency. I believe him.

Put your gun on the floor.

887
01:26:37.916 --> 01:26:39.759
What were you gonna do? Shoot me?

888
01:26:41.461 --> 01:26:43.589
There's a bomb
that's gonna go off any second.


889
01:26:43.755 --> 01:26:46.133
You know what happens then?
We're all gonna be dead.


890
01:26:46.299 --> 01:26:48.176
And I'm gonna win by default.

891
01:26:48.343 --> 01:26:51.847
My young self is still gonna be president
and you can't save your wife.


892
01:26:52.013 --> 01:26:54.015
Just like you couldn't save her
once before.


893
01:26:54.182 --> 01:26:56.651
She died because you came back
and made some changes.


894
01:26:56.810 --> 01:26:59.313
So now you're gonna fuck with time.

895
01:26:59.813 --> 01:27:03.943
- You're as bad as me.
- Wrong. I'm setting it right.


896
01:27:05.610 --> 01:27:07.783
Usually, I hate doing things
more than once.


897
01:27:07.946 --> 01:27:10.119
But in this case,
I don't see any other option.


898
01:27:10.740 --> 01:27:12.492
I do.

899
01:27:15.954 --> 01:27:17.331
What are you doing here?

900
01:27:17.497 --> 01:27:20.171
What do you mean? You called.
You left a message with the senate operator.


901
01:27:20.333 --> 01:27:22.927
I didn't leave any message, you idiot.

902
01:27:23.086 --> 01:27:25.680
Don't argue among yourself. I left it.

903
01:27:26.882 --> 01:27:28.304
Now nobody's got a future.

904
01:27:29.467 --> 01:27:34.644
Okay, this is a real mess now.
I hope you're happy. This is a real mess.


905
01:27:34.806 --> 01:27:39.152
You turned what was gonna be a simple
ordinary murder into a bloodbath.


906
01:27:40.645 --> 01:27:43.319
You get out of here. Get out of here.
Go, now, go.


907
01:27:49.154 --> 01:27:51.327
- You two should be closer.
- Keep him away.


908
01:27:51.489 --> 01:27:56.336
Same matter can't occupy same space.
I'm still kicking. I must be on Broadway.


909
01:27:57.162 --> 01:27:59.711
No!

Hey, where you going?


914
01:30:23.767 --> 01:30:26.987
- What happened to you?
MATUZAK: What are you talking about?


915
01:30:27.771 --> 01:30:29.193
You're walking around.

916
01:30:29.355 --> 01:30:33.781
Yeah, I've been doing that since I'm 2.
Does that strike you as abnormal?

Hey, what's going on
with Senator McComb?


919
01:30:42.702 --> 01:30:43.999
Senator McComb?

920
01:30:44.162 --> 01:30:46.085
- Yeah.
- If you want time off, ask for it.


921
01:30:46.247 --> 01:30:48.966
- Don't act like you're out of your head.
- Got a blank spot.


922
01:30:49.125 --> 01:30:51.503
A blank spot?
You've got a hole in your head.


923
01:30:51.669 --> 01:30:55.515
Ten years ago, McComb left his office,
canceled all his appointments, disappeared.


924
01:30:55.673 --> 01:30:59.928
- Nobody's ever seen him.
- That's so sad. I remember.
