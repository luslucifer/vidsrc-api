<b>The Legend Of Ben Hall</b>

3
00:02:41.526 --> 00:02:42.558
So, where we goin' now?

4
00:02:43.844 --> 00:02:44.448
Back to the locker.

5
00:02:46.897 --> 00:02:48.353
What do you expect
to find up there?


6
00:02:48.473 --> 00:02:49.376
I'll tell you what

7
00:02:49.984 --> 00:02:51.849
A lot of bloody nothin'
and you know it!


8
00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:54.670
Should be goin' down south
crossin' into Victoria like Jack did


9
00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:56.548
I'm not going south, Jim
and that's the end of it!


10
00:03:27.811 --> 00:03:28.105
Jim...

11
00:03:31.193 --> 00:03:32.385
Jim, get up,
it's your watch.


12
00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:34.237
It's your watch

13
00:04:37.583 --> 00:04:39.395
Where are you,
you bastards?


14
00:04:46.501 --> 00:04:47.533
Ben Hall!

15
00:04:48.698 --> 00:04:50.078
Come out and
surrender yourself!


16
00:04:50.639 --> 00:04:51.893
Remember the Queen!

17
00:04:53.465 --> 00:04:54.269
Halt!

18
00:04:54.658 --> 00:04:57.172
We know you're out there,
we got you bloody surrounded!


19
00:05:29.647 --> 00:05:30.126
Shot!

20
00:05:53.074 --> 00:05:54.229
After him, boys!

21
00:06:24.513 --> 00:06:27.912
I've shot the bastard!
I've shot Ben Hall!


22
00:06:40.605 --> 00:06:41.657
There he is!

23
00:06:42.251 --> 00:06:43.049
Come on!

24
00:07:35.858 --> 00:07:36.234
Will!

25
00:07:37.248 --> 00:07:39.126
Will, over here!

26
00:07:43.313 --> 00:07:44.660
Ah, Jesus Christ!

27
00:07:45.272 --> 00:07:46.975
You got a pellet in you?
You alright?


28
00:07:48.412 --> 00:07:50.170
The bullet went straight through.
Right.


29
00:07:50.540 --> 00:07:53.293
Damn, lookie there!
Bad shots, right?


30
00:07:54.751 --> 00:07:57.022
How the hell did those traps get
so close without us knowing?


31
00:08:26.373 --> 00:08:27.650
Hands in the air, Mr. Gibson.

32
00:08:31.097 --> 00:08:31.848
Benjamin?

33
00:08:32.684 --> 00:08:34.421
It's good to see you again
after all these years.


34
00:08:35.839 --> 00:08:37.501
You look well.
Hey,


35
00:08:37.973 --> 00:08:41.109
I need horses and food.
and clean rags, now!


36
00:08:41.419 --> 00:08:42.780
I hope you
forgive our intrusion,


37
00:08:43.475 --> 00:08:45.438
under normal circumstances,
I would leave you, Bill, alone.


38
00:08:47.052 --> 00:08:48.244
This is a matter of
life and death.


39
00:08:50.573 --> 00:08:51.953
What are you doing
back out this way?


40
00:08:52.441 --> 00:08:54.648
Thought you boys were
ranging around Carcoar.


41
00:08:55.450 --> 00:08:56.896
Carcoar was getting
too hot for us.


42
00:08:57.537 --> 00:09:00.016
Then, you are back here for good?
No.


43
00:09:01.566 --> 00:09:03.002
I'm just lookin' for someone.
Who?


44
00:09:04.730 --> 00:09:05.321
Just someone.

45
00:09:06.920 --> 00:09:07.718
I might be able to help.

46
00:09:12.714 --> 00:09:13.521
I'm lookin' for Biddy.

47
00:09:15.962 --> 00:09:16.995
You don't know
where she is?


48
00:09:18.188 --> 00:09:18.573
No.

49
00:09:20.253 --> 00:09:21.746
After she left, I
never found her again.


50
00:09:23.521 --> 00:09:24.545
What do you
want with her now?


51
00:09:32.981 --> 00:09:34.051
You know where she is.

52
00:09:36.155 --> 00:09:38.110
Where is she?
Will I regret telling you?


53
00:09:38.230 --> 00:09:39.660
You'll regret it
more if you don't.


54
00:09:44.690 --> 00:09:46.850
She's on Marsdon Station
out of Micalb.


55
00:09:47.310 --> 00:09:48.475
Your boy's there too.

56
00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:50.465
So, a little word...

57
00:09:54.632 --> 00:09:56.125
She's still with Jim Taylor.

58
00:10:00.867 --> 00:10:01.834
What are you gonna do?

59
00:10:03.489 --> 00:10:04.588
That's not your concern.

60
00:10:07.564 --> 00:10:08.484
Thanks for the horses, Bill.

61
00:10:18.963 --> 00:10:20.709
I'm done, lad, I'm leavin'.

62
00:10:21.111 --> 00:10:22.926
What do you mean, Jim?
What I mean is...


63
00:10:23.046 --> 00:10:24.672
I'm headin' to Victoria
as fast as I can.


64
00:10:25.367 --> 00:10:27.329
To hell with bushrangin',
It doesn't mean a damn!


65
00:10:27.526 --> 00:10:28.324
There's no money in it

66
00:10:28.444 --> 00:10:29.786
and I'm gettin' out
while I can and


67
00:10:29.870 --> 00:10:32.559
live what life I got left in free
but not in fuckin' chains.


68
00:10:33.498 --> 00:10:34.878
Alone is when
they catch you.


69
00:10:34.998 --> 00:10:37.977
Then why don't you come to Victoria with me?
I'm not going to bloody Victoria!


70
00:10:38.759 --> 00:10:40.111
Aah, suit yourself.

71
00:10:40.553 --> 00:10:44.131
Chase that woman? You might put
this shite behind you and move on, huh?


72
00:10:46.345 --> 00:10:47.945
We're through, old man.

73
00:10:48.881 --> 00:10:49.567
Oh, yeah?

74
00:10:50.224 --> 00:10:50.956
We are.

75
00:10:51.651 --> 00:10:53.398
See, this is your problem, boyo.

76
00:10:53.876 --> 00:10:55.811
Women, they always
get the better of you,


77
00:10:56.841 --> 00:11:00.709
especially that screwer
you keep pining about.


78
00:11:01.423 --> 00:11:02.540
Fuckin' bastard!

79
00:11:07.572 --> 00:11:09.271
You'll never even
make the Murray, you old fool,


80
00:11:09.515 --> 00:11:10.360
let alone cross it!

81
00:12:12.141 --> 00:12:12.939
Henry!

82
00:12:13.283 --> 00:12:15.255
Get inside right now!
Go!


83
00:12:40.336 --> 00:12:43.182
You're not welcome here, Benjamin!
You hear me?


84
00:12:44.031 --> 00:12:44.838
Get out of here!

85
00:12:45.871 --> 00:12:46.763
Where's Taylor

86
00:12:47.721 --> 00:12:48.961
Not here, now go!

87
00:12:50.745 --> 00:12:52.078
I've come to see my son.

88
00:12:52.360 --> 00:12:54.284
He doesn't remember
who you are, Benjamin.


89
00:12:55.215 --> 00:12:56.211
Call him out here.

90
00:13:01.966 --> 00:13:03.056
I won't ask you again.

91
00:13:05.122 --> 00:13:05.873
Call him out.

92
00:13:08.925 --> 00:13:09.873
Henry!

93
00:13:11.432 --> 00:13:12.925
Come out here, please.

94
00:13:17.895 --> 00:13:18.891
It's alright!

95
00:13:33.426 --> 00:13:34.055
Henry...

96
00:13:35.304 --> 00:13:36.149
Do you remember me?

97
00:13:41.211 --> 00:13:42.263
I'm your father, Henry!

98
00:13:43.803 --> 00:13:45.042
Your Dah, remember?

99
00:13:46.525 --> 00:13:47.098
It's true.

100
00:13:47.840 --> 00:13:49.361
I've been looking
for you for a long time.


101
00:13:51.323 --> 00:13:52.280
Because, your mum,

102
00:13:53.323 --> 00:13:54.618
she took you away from me.

103
00:13:56.881 --> 00:13:58.581
Henry, I need you
to do something...


104
00:13:59.973 --> 00:14:00.959
quick as you can,

105
00:14:01.710 --> 00:14:03.870
get your clothes and
everything that belongs to you.


106
00:14:04.893 --> 00:14:06.668
because you're coming with me now.
What?


107
00:14:06.788 --> 00:14:08.471
Go on.
What are you talking about?


108
00:14:08.591 --> 00:14:09.446
Benjamin?

109
00:14:10.516 --> 00:14:11.840
You are not
taking him anywhere!


110
00:14:11.869 --> 00:14:12.930
He's my son!

111
00:14:13.207 --> 00:14:15.225
You had no right to take him
from me and I will not have


112
00:14:15.345 --> 00:14:16.850
Taylor raising him,
not for another minute!


113
00:14:17.130 --> 00:14:20.172
No! I won't let you
take him, you bastard!


114
00:14:21.607 --> 00:14:22.837
Do you hear me?

115
00:14:23.043 --> 00:14:26.358
No, I won't let you take him!
He's coming with me...


116
00:14:26.478 --> 00:14:29.184
or I'll wait here for Taylor to
get back and when he does,


117
00:14:29.304 --> 00:14:31.306
I swear I'll do what I should
have done a long time ago.


118
00:14:31.739 --> 00:14:33.091
I was right to leave you!

119
00:14:34.622 --> 00:14:35.908
Look what you've become!

120
00:14:42.310 --> 00:14:43.737
So, what's it gonna be?

121
00:14:44.958 --> 00:14:47.437
Well, what choice do I have?
None.


122
00:14:48.977 --> 00:14:49.906
See how you like it.

123
00:14:53.173 --> 00:14:54.572
Where are you taking him?

124
00:15:07.070 --> 00:15:09.108
Jesus, Ben!
Can I come in?


125
00:15:09.228 --> 00:15:10.282
Yeah, of course. Quickly!

126
00:15:15.200 --> 00:15:17.707
I won't have that bastard, Taylor,
bringing up my son.


127
00:15:18.515 --> 00:15:20.628
He's a drunkard and a
scoundrel, you know that.


128
00:15:20.748 --> 00:15:21.435
I know that.

129
00:15:21.952 --> 00:15:23.980
It doesn't seem right,
snatching him away like that.


130
00:15:24.837 --> 00:15:26.227
No worse than what
she did to me.


131
00:15:26.347 --> 00:15:29.551
Ben, the police will come
after us if he stays here.


132
00:15:30.058 --> 00:15:30.885
I'm his father,

133
00:15:32.077 --> 00:15:34.781
I decide who he lives with
and not the bloody police.


134
00:15:34.901 --> 00:15:36.509
Henry doesn't know
his Benjamin


135
00:15:36.629 --> 00:15:39.636
He'll want to see his mother.
She'll come looking for him, too.


136
00:15:39.645 --> 00:15:40.058
No!

137
00:15:40.725 --> 00:15:42.415
She's no more fit to
raise him than Taylor is.


138
00:15:42.680 --> 00:15:44.802
But she's still his mother.
She doesn't deserve to be!


139
00:15:47.149 --> 00:15:52.085
Bill, I can't raise him
but you can


140
00:15:54.141 --> 00:15:54.845
Please, Bill.

141
00:15:56.729 --> 00:15:58.250
I'll ask nothing else
of you, ever again.


142
00:16:02.729 --> 00:16:04.935
I can't stay, Henry.
I'm sorry.


143
00:16:07.451 --> 00:16:09.085
but Uncle Bill and Auntie Anne
are your family,


144
00:16:10.118 --> 00:16:11.207
they're going to take good care of you.

145
00:16:11.461 --> 00:16:12.822
When can I go home?

146
00:16:15.076 --> 00:16:15.921
This is your home now.

147
00:16:17.386 --> 00:16:18.719
I'll come to see you
as often as I can.


148
00:17:17.396 --> 00:17:19.490
You expecting anyone?
No.


149
00:17:29.843 --> 00:17:30.547
Who's there?

150
00:17:31.617 --> 00:17:32.322
Hello, Mitch.

151
00:17:33.439 --> 00:17:35.561
Ben? Is that you?

152
00:17:37.189 --> 00:17:38.513
Ha, ha, ha,ha, ha!

153
00:17:39.124 --> 00:17:41.358
You're the last person I ever
expected to see tonight!


154
00:17:44.100 --> 00:17:45.274
Look who it is, Mary.

155
00:17:46.264 --> 00:17:47.654
Benjamin!

156
00:17:48.960 --> 00:17:52.143
So wonderful to see you.
My God, it's been so long!


157
00:17:52.263 --> 00:17:55.063
Not intruding, am I?
Not at all, you're always welcome!


158
00:17:55.782 --> 00:17:58.796
Looking rather frightful, these days.
I am sorry about that.


159
00:17:59.022 --> 00:18:00.656
Let's just get the man
something to eat, love,


160
00:18:06.404 --> 00:18:10.301
Is this Catherine?
You're all grown up!


161
00:18:10.582 --> 00:18:13.634
Catherine, this is an old friend
of your Ma and Da's, Mr. Hall.


162
00:18:14.132 --> 00:18:15.268
Hi, Mr. Hall.

163
00:18:29.374 --> 00:18:29.947
Da!

164
00:18:38.264 --> 00:18:38.987
Ben!

165
00:19:07.131 --> 00:19:08.511
You stay right here.

166
00:19:27.259 --> 00:19:30.771
Good morning, gentlemen!
Can I offer your men some water?


167
00:19:30.891 --> 00:19:34.611
No, thank you, Madam, we've just come
from the Stricklands, they took care of us.


168
00:19:35.485 --> 00:19:38.555
Well, then, Colonel, I'll leave you to it.
If you do see anything, make sure to...


169
00:20:05.635 --> 00:20:06.987
They were just happening by.

170
00:20:07.241 --> 00:20:09.288
They do that from time to time,
asking questions.


171
00:20:09.560 --> 00:20:12.002
And what did you tell them, Mick?
Same as I always do:


172
00:20:12.894 --> 00:20:15.617
that I haven't seen you,
not for years.


173
00:20:19.297 --> 00:20:21.466
Do you know who's that Inspector?
Ernst Sanderson.


174
00:20:21.757 --> 00:20:22.800
He's not such a bad sort.

175
00:20:23.898 --> 00:20:27.250
I keep things friendly with him.
It's easier for us that way.


176
00:20:29.166 --> 00:20:30.546
They know you're in the area, Ben

177
00:20:31.541 --> 00:20:32.969
It's not safe for you here.

178
00:20:34.255 --> 00:20:35.109
For any of us.

179
00:21:33.607 --> 00:21:34.321
Jack!

180
00:21:37.579 --> 00:21:39.917
What the hell are you doing here?
Looking for you, of course!


181
00:21:40.409 --> 00:21:42.278
Knew I'd find you here
with Goobang Mick.


182
00:21:42.559 --> 00:21:46.127
Does his missus still fancy you?
Keep your voice down!


183
00:21:47.019 --> 00:21:47.592
What happened?

184
00:21:47.930 --> 00:21:49.489
Thought you'd be halfway
back to Canada by now.


185
00:21:49.527 --> 00:21:50.560
No, forget that...

186
00:21:50.785 --> 00:21:52.147
went home to Victoria
for a while.


187
00:21:52.560 --> 00:21:54.635
But I'm ready to come out again.
Had to...


188
00:21:55.048 --> 00:21:57.903
Blew all my cash on cheap grogan
and cheaper tarts


189
00:21:59.854 --> 00:22:01.206
It was glorious!

190
00:22:01.939 --> 00:22:03.394
Heard they caught the old man
down on the river.


191
00:22:05.328 --> 00:22:06.089
I did warn him.

192
00:22:06.333 --> 00:22:08.427
Ah,the man was a
pain in the ass, anyway.


193
00:22:10.524 --> 00:22:11.735
Christ, you look terrible!

194
00:22:12.224 --> 00:22:13.134
You know that.

195
00:22:16.055 --> 00:22:18.092
Compared to you, I always did.
This is true!


196
00:22:18.524 --> 00:22:19.923
One cannot buy style, they said.

197
00:22:21.422 --> 00:22:23.629
I'll tell ya, I'm just itching
to get back out there.


198
00:22:24.418 --> 00:22:25.864
You know, one paper claimed I was dead

199
00:22:26.061 --> 00:22:27.620
and that you were
the bloke who shot me.

200
00:22:29.246 --> 00:22:31.904
Now, I want them to
know that I'm alive


201
00:22:32.908 --> 00:22:34.476
and... back on the job.

202
00:22:35.134 --> 00:22:35.998
I think we should give it up.

203
00:22:37.164 --> 00:22:39.032
Give it up?
Come on, Ben!


204
00:22:39.408 --> 00:22:40.770
2 years, we rode together.

205
00:22:41.192 --> 00:22:42.826
2 years and they couldn't touch us.

206
00:22:43.079 --> 00:22:44.150
Place is getting hotter, Jack.

207
00:22:44.956 --> 00:22:45.557
More than ever.

208
00:22:45.838 --> 00:22:46.646
It's alright, Gilbert,

209
00:22:46.766 --> 00:22:49.528
Sir Fred's got the Lochland by the
.balls and he's sqeezing tight.


210
00:22:49.648 --> 00:22:52.862
Alright, so let's head south,
Auburn way.


211
00:22:53.260 --> 00:22:54.499
keep clear out of the Lochland

212
00:22:54.790 --> 00:22:56.415
We'd need to skip the country, Jack.
What?


213
00:22:56.828 --> 00:22:57.476
And go where?

214
00:23:01.293 --> 00:23:01.913
America.

215
00:23:03.688 --> 00:23:05.763
Why the hell do you
want to go to America?


216
00:23:06.166 --> 00:23:07.087
It's not part of the Empire.

217
00:23:07.124 --> 00:23:08.983
They're fighting a bloody
Civil War over there.


218
00:23:09.002 --> 00:23:11.303
And war is the perfect time
to slip in without a fuss!


219
00:23:12.158 --> 00:23:15.258
To get passage, will cost us a small
fortune, Ben. You do know that?


220
00:23:16.934 --> 00:23:18.201
So we need to
go ahead and get it.


221
00:23:21.572 --> 00:23:23.225
Like I said:
we head south.


222
00:23:23.750 --> 00:23:25.657
Hit the mailrooms,
we just bale them up!


223
00:23:25.966 --> 00:23:27.431
One after the other,
bang, bang, bang!


224
00:23:28.023 --> 00:23:30.108
Right, just the pair of us.

225
00:23:30.361 --> 00:23:31.488
We'll find some more lads.

226
00:23:32.070 --> 00:23:33.873
Cold, sly, kids with some real moxie.

227
00:23:34.493 --> 00:23:35.695
Come on, Ben!

228
00:23:36.899 --> 00:23:39.021
It's no fun playing
without you in the game.


229
00:23:44.469 --> 00:23:48.075
We ride again, we do so
for one purpose:


230
00:23:48.694 --> 00:23:51.671
to get out, to skip the country
for good. Are we clear?


231
00:23:52.340 --> 00:23:53.335
Now, I'm up for that.

232
00:23:56.058 --> 00:23:57.945
MM, Goobang, how's the wife?

233
00:24:05.533 --> 00:24:07.758
There's some bread, bacon
and potatoes.


234
00:24:08.384 --> 00:24:09.079
You're a sweetheart.

235
00:24:10.759 --> 00:24:13.313
Thanks for everything, Mick.
You're always welcome.


236
00:24:15.642 --> 00:24:18.938
Maam, always a pleasure.
So long, godday!


237
00:24:54.439 --> 00:24:55.472
Just me, then.

238
00:24:56.749 --> 00:24:59.941
I have company!
You remember Mr. Kelly?


239
00:25:00.458 --> 00:25:02.608
Of course, you're lookin'
better than ever, young Benjamin.


240
00:25:02.908 --> 00:25:03.923
Mr. Kelly.
Miss!


241
00:25:04.457 --> 00:25:06.748
It's John-John, the jockey
I was telling you about.


242
00:25:06.868 --> 00:25:07.987
My grandson.

243
00:25:09.940 --> 00:25:11.715
Very pleased to
finally meet you, Mr. Hall.


244
00:25:13.410 --> 00:25:13.936
Join us.

245
00:25:14.818 --> 00:25:16.095
Johnny here
did a bloody good job


246
00:25:16.133 --> 00:25:18.105
telegraphing for me in
Omelia, a few years back.


247
00:25:19.307 --> 00:25:22.048
How ols are you?
Almost eighteen.


248
00:25:23.486 --> 00:25:24.115
What do you do?

249
00:25:24.378 --> 00:25:25.749
He's the best jockey you'll ever meet, Ben.

250
00:25:26.500 --> 00:25:27.824
As good a horseman
as the both of us.


251
00:25:28.894 --> 00:25:30.847
So what can we possibly
do for you, Mr. Dunne?


252
00:25:32.070 --> 00:25:36.125
The lad's got himself into some
serious trouble with the Trapps,


253
00:25:36.126 --> 00:25:36.326
The lad's got himself
into some serious trouble,


254
00:25:36.526 --> 00:25:38.953
Oops, haven't we all!
That true?


255
00:25:40.081 --> 00:25:42.447
Me and my mate, Daniel Ryan,
robbed a fella...


256
00:25:43.001 --> 00:25:44.081
then got ourselves nabbed.

257
00:25:44.400 --> 00:25:47.358
We were supposed to show for trial
but I bolted.


258
00:25:47.602 --> 00:25:49.385
There's a warrant out for his arrest,

259
00:25:49.665 --> 00:25:51.928
if caught, they'll
throw him in the cells.


260
00:25:52.350 --> 00:25:55.749
You're lookin' to join with us.
Is that what you want?


261
00:25:56.266 --> 00:25:57.233
More than anything!

262
00:26:02.439 --> 00:26:04.580
Despite what the papers
encourage you to imagine,


263
00:26:06.402 --> 00:26:07.801
this life you want is not easy.

264
00:26:10.649 --> 00:26:12.771
In fact, most days, it's nothing
short of hell on earth.


265
00:26:13.757 --> 00:26:16.236
One false step,
one bad judgement,


266
00:26:17.334 --> 00:26:19.203
you could be shot dead
or made to dance or nothin'.


267
00:26:20.552 --> 00:26:21.557
Understand?

268
00:26:22.674 --> 00:26:24.721
Seems you're here now because
you made some bad choices.


269
00:26:25.819 --> 00:26:27.200
You sure you're not
just making another?


270
00:26:27.594 --> 00:26:30.139
Now, now! No need to
insult our friend here!


271
00:26:30.338 --> 00:26:32.131
He needs to know the nature
of what he seeks, Jack.


272
00:26:33.108 --> 00:26:34.845
We do this because we
have no recoutrse left.


273
00:26:36.479 --> 00:26:37.389
Not for a lark

274
00:26:38.037 --> 00:26:39.633
and not because we want
our names in the papers.


275
00:26:39.981 --> 00:26:42.337
He's speaking for himself.
You ride with us, John...


276
00:26:44.108 --> 00:26:45.752
you can never again
lead a normal life.


277
00:26:46.784 --> 00:26:48.803
With respect, Mr. Hall...

278
00:26:50.296 --> 00:26:51.892
my life has never been normal.

279
00:27:00.910 --> 00:27:02.253
Welcome aboard, Johnny!

280
00:27:44.553 --> 00:27:45.220
Get out!

281
00:27:47.887 --> 00:27:48.798
Hand those over, maam.

282
00:27:49.830 --> 00:27:50.535
I'll take that!

283
00:27:55.331 --> 00:27:56.542
There, Mister!
Huh?


284
00:27:56.824 --> 00:27:58.730
Move your hands, I'll blow
your bloody brains out.


285
00:28:41.531 --> 00:28:42.639
This is what I like to see.

286
00:28:43.568 --> 00:28:44.789
Listen to this,
listen to this!


287
00:28:45.486 --> 00:28:48.116
I regret to state that the
reports of Gilbert's resurgence...


288
00:28:48.313 --> 00:28:49.393
turns out to be fact.

289
00:28:49.712 --> 00:28:51.468
He returns to his
favorite hunting grounds,


290
00:28:51.693 --> 00:28:55.440
bringing with him a fresh hand,
the young John Dunne


291
00:28:55.560 --> 00:28:56.154
There's more!

292
00:28:56.755 --> 00:28:59.844
He is the very beau ideal
of a modern bushranger,


293
00:29:00.285 --> 00:29:04.276
youthful and daring, with the
agility and nature of a tiger cat.


294
00:29:04.614 --> 00:29:06.862
a splendid rider and a
thorough bushman.


295
00:29:06.982 --> 00:29:09.059
What can I say,
I'm famous already!


296
00:29:09.097 --> 00:29:11.087
Never have the public
more to dread


297
00:29:11.293 --> 00:29:14.335
or the authorities, a more
formidable gang to deal with


298
00:29:14.955 --> 00:29:15.640
than now.

299
00:29:16.607 --> 00:29:18.589
Wooh!
What'd I tell ya, huh?


300
00:29:18.998 --> 00:29:20.425
Was I right about
our boy here, Ben?


301
00:29:20.688 --> 00:29:22.660
You were right.
And another thing,


302
00:29:22.895 --> 00:29:23.561
from here on,

303
00:29:23.796 --> 00:29:26.669
we start teaching manners to any
wretches that help the police against us.


304
00:29:26.789 --> 00:29:27.946
How do we
teach them manners?


305
00:29:28.394 --> 00:29:31.304
Simple! We burn their property
to the bloody stumps.


306
00:29:31.342 --> 00:29:34.290
No! We start that kind of work and
the country'll get too hot to hold us.


307
00:29:34.722 --> 00:29:35.276
Wrong!

308
00:29:35.396 --> 00:29:37.595
It'll make anyone think twice
before crossing us.


309
00:29:37.791 --> 00:29:40.401
What it will do is make every
settler turn out and hunt us down.


310
00:29:41.652 --> 00:29:45.756
We wouldn't last a month.
Fine, I'll just shoot them, then.


311
00:29:48.385 --> 00:29:50.413
You do so and you'll
have me to reckon with.


312
00:29:50.817 --> 00:29:52.620
I won't take the life of
another man who hasn't


313
00:29:52.740 --> 00:29:53.869
first tried to take mine.

314
00:29:54.132 --> 00:29:55.277
You can do what you like

315
00:29:55.397 --> 00:29:57.587
but I mean to shoot any man
I find helping the Trapps.


316
00:29:57.784 --> 00:30:01.052
Or any trap I come across.
No, you won't.


317
00:30:16.083 --> 00:30:17.153
Hello, lass!

318
00:30:18.656 --> 00:30:19.782
Can you open that for me?

319
00:30:21.172 --> 00:30:22.637
I'd really like to keep this.

320
00:30:23.163 --> 00:30:23.642
Why?

321
00:30:23.679 --> 00:30:25.163
Because it's very
important to me.


322
00:30:25.283 --> 00:30:26.130
It's very special.

323
00:30:27.197 --> 00:30:28.286
Alright.
Thank you.


324
00:30:28.314 --> 00:30:29.356
Hat, please, sir.

325
00:30:31.816 --> 00:30:34.830
That bag's... Whoo!
Thank you.


326
00:30:39.068 --> 00:30:40.570
Mr. Fancy Britches!

327
00:30:41.246 --> 00:30:42.880
You travel quite loaded, I'd expect.

328
00:30:44.157 --> 00:30:46.814
Turn out your pockets.
I refuse.


329
00:30:48.715 --> 00:30:49.851
Wanna rethink your answer?

330
00:30:50.152 --> 00:30:51.945
No. Go ahead, shoot me,
if you're going to.


331
00:30:53.833 --> 00:30:55.147
Not in front of these ladies.

332
00:30:56.471 --> 00:30:58.349
But I will rip you trousers off,
tie you to that tree


333
00:30:58.469 --> 00:31:00.208
and leave you there with your
tallywhacker hanging out,


334
00:31:00.434 --> 00:31:01.673
for all to see

335
00:31:02.728 --> 00:31:04.014
John Gilbert, is it?

336
00:31:05.112 --> 00:31:06.840
Happy Jack, to you, sir.

337
00:31:07.638 --> 00:31:10.540
Now, turn out your pockets!

338
00:31:16.150 --> 00:31:16.657
Better!

339
00:31:18.403 --> 00:31:19.877
I can do yo
better than all that.


340
00:31:21.051 --> 00:31:24.422
I will write you out a check for 50 pounds,
in exchange for the loan of a revolver


341
00:31:25.352 --> 00:31:29.502
and a duel, at 20 paces,
this instant.


342
00:31:33.734 --> 00:31:36.485
Bless you, sir. That is the
kindest proposition I've had all day


343
00:31:37.387 --> 00:31:40.222
but I must regrettably decline.
I didn't think you'd be game enough.


344
00:31:41.227 --> 00:31:41.874
What did you say?

345
00:31:43.398 --> 00:31:47.529
I did not think you would be
game enough, Happy Jack!


346
00:31:49.201 --> 00:31:50.487
I'm not game enough?

347
00:31:56.949 --> 00:31:59.194
Keep your check! I'll show you
how fucking game I am,


348
00:31:59.203 --> 00:32:00.226
you Jimmy Grant cock!

349
00:32:00.503 --> 00:32:02.700
You want me to blow your bloody
brains out all over the highway?


350
00:32:02.934 --> 00:32:03.761
I'm game for that!

351
00:32:04.390 --> 00:32:05.244
What are you waiting for?

352
00:32:05.272 --> 00:32:06.718
20 paces and turn!
Jack!


353
00:32:07.069 --> 00:32:07.708
Cool off!

354
00:32:07.828 --> 00:32:10.102
He's the one talking fight
and I'll gladly give him one!


355
00:32:12.957 --> 00:32:16.365
If you want a shooting match with us,
bring your own revolver next time.


356
00:32:17.819 --> 00:32:18.937
Get back to work!

357
00:32:21.040 --> 00:32:24.354
You two, open your purses
Right now, come on, move!


358
00:32:31.998 --> 00:32:34.411
So, when does the fun start?

359
00:32:38.063 --> 00:32:38.955
Won't be long now.

360
00:33:08.169 --> 00:33:08.930
Major, sir!

361
00:33:09.606 --> 00:33:11.287
Whole gang, right here!

362
00:33:19.353 --> 00:33:23.466
Hey, you, drop it! Drop it or
I'll blow your bloody head off!


363
00:33:25.088 --> 00:33:26.610
Get back inside, now!

364
00:33:30.919 --> 00:33:34.140
Jack, we got 2 more!
Let's go!


365
00:33:50.807 --> 00:33:52.744
Surrender!

366
00:34:04.742 --> 00:34:07.034
Draw back!
Draw back!


367
00:34:07.064 --> 00:34:10.281
Go! You'll draw their fire, Debby!
Get away from the coach!


368
00:34:14.210 --> 00:34:15.464
Surrender!

369
00:34:15.465 --> 00:34:16.686
Saved you, Boss!

370
00:34:18.171 --> 00:34:19.063
Bloody traps!

371
00:34:19.096 --> 00:34:20.978
There!
Stand fast!


372
00:34:21.407 --> 00:34:23.388
Stand fast, you bastards!

373
00:34:23.411 --> 00:34:24.861
Surrender!
Never...


374
00:34:24.890 --> 00:34:26.977
Give in to a
bloody bushranger!


375
00:34:54.683 --> 00:34:56.404
Smartest thing you ever did.

376
00:35:23.370 --> 00:35:24.145
Get out!

377
00:35:33.044 --> 00:35:36.432
Eureka! It's all here!
Hoards of cash!


378
00:35:36.552 --> 00:35:37.214
Get all of it!

379
00:35:38.572 --> 00:35:40.939
What the hell?
Mr. Hall,


380
00:35:41.455 --> 00:35:42.676
The bank notes
are all cut in half.


381
00:35:48.294 --> 00:35:49.149
Check them all.

382
00:35:53.108 --> 00:35:55.887
Why are they cut in half?
I said why are they cut in half!


383
00:35:56.413 --> 00:35:58.422
That's the way the banks
are sending them, these days,


384
00:35:58.450 --> 00:35:59.756
you've left them little choice.

385
00:35:59.793 --> 00:36:01.981
And where are the other halves?
They come at a later time.


386
00:36:02.018 --> 00:36:02.638
When?

387
00:36:02.876 --> 00:36:04.876
Nobody knows,
that's the whole point!


388
00:36:08.519 --> 00:36:10.388
Mr. Hall, they're all the same.

389
00:36:11.640 --> 00:36:13.771
Take them with us.
But they're worthless!


390
00:36:13.891 --> 00:36:15.828
So are the other halves,
if they don't get these back.


391
00:36:44.787 --> 00:36:47.688
You heard me out there.
I gave him fair warning.


392
00:36:48.017 --> 00:36:49.913
That's what the bloody fool
got for not standing.


393
00:36:50.129 --> 00:36:53.031
Fair warning or not, today,
you branded us as killers.


394
00:36:54.617 --> 00:36:56.477
Half the country will be
gunning for us now.


395
00:36:57.200 --> 00:36:58.693
This is who we are, Ben!

396
00:36:59.354 --> 00:37:01.100
This is what we do.
It's us or it's them.


397
00:37:01.130 --> 00:37:03.260
We're worth more to our friends
dead than we are alive.


398
00:37:03.754 --> 00:37:05.331
How long do you think
we can last, Jack?


399
00:37:08.792 --> 00:37:11.646
Any more talk of shooting people,
I'll bore a hole through you myself!


400
00:37:13.702 --> 00:37:14.688
We're getting out of the district.

401
00:37:42.630 --> 00:37:46.620
...coming straight towards me and
I said: "Stand! Stand! Stand! Bang!"


402
00:37:46.876 --> 00:37:48.341
One shot, right here.

403
00:37:48.745 --> 00:37:50.257
One on the ground!
Fellow's a pip!


404
00:37:51.261 --> 00:37:52.811
Never seen a dead man before.

405
00:37:53.234 --> 00:37:56.023
So, it's the truth: what
happened to Sgt. Perry?


406
00:37:57.328 --> 00:38:00.145
Be careful, Ben, what I mind,
a few boys'll hear,


407
00:38:01.997 --> 00:38:04.795
but i know a lot of fellas that would
turn you in, given half the chance.


408
00:38:05.832 --> 00:38:06.714
Watch you back.

409
00:38:33.962 --> 00:38:36.488
You got enough pistols there, boy?

410
00:38:38.704 --> 00:38:39.492
Beg your pardon?

411
00:38:39.689 --> 00:38:42.187
Have you got enough
pistols there, boy?


412
00:38:48.221 --> 00:38:50.024
Missing one?
Yeah...


413
00:38:50.230 --> 00:38:52.803
a great big long one
right between your legs!


414
00:38:55.366 --> 00:38:57.826
Go away., old damn Mordemaker!
Oi!


415
00:39:06.027 --> 00:39:08.788
Any last wisecrack before I
blow your head inside out?


416
00:39:08.818 --> 00:39:09.952
Hold your horses, son.

417
00:39:10.065 --> 00:39:12.065
He's just havin' a lark.
Hubert, let him pay!


418
00:39:12.386 --> 00:39:14.320
No one wants to see
a man killed today.


419
00:39:22.849 --> 00:39:25.431
No, of course not,

420
00:39:25.910 --> 00:39:30.051
but I reckon I know what
everyone would like to see.


421
00:39:33.293 --> 00:39:35.734
Put my manhood to
the test, if you dare.


422
00:40:30.130 --> 00:40:32.693
Gentlemen, the
next round is on me!


423
00:40:45.344 --> 00:40:46.490
This one's jammed again.

424
00:40:47.724 --> 00:40:48.635
I'm not surprised.

425
00:40:50.175 --> 00:40:51.161
Yours never do.

426
00:40:53.274 --> 00:40:53.875
Really!

427
00:40:55.208 --> 00:40:56.316
Trantors are handmade.

428
00:40:57.416 --> 00:40:58.515
Beautiful craftsmanship.

429
00:41:00.412 --> 00:41:01.435
Besy revolvers in the world!

430
00:41:05.801 --> 00:41:07.435
Reckon I'd like to get one for myself.

431
00:41:12.914 --> 00:41:16.595
Mr. Hall, why did you
become a bushranger?


432
00:41:17.970 --> 00:41:19.013
Couple of years back...

433
00:41:20.552 --> 00:41:23.369
the police took a set against me because
I was friendly with Frank Gardner.


434
00:41:24.439 --> 00:41:26.711
Pottinger threw me in the lobs
for almost a month.


435
00:41:27.318 --> 00:41:30.031
After that, I helped Gardner
with the escort delivery.


436
00:41:30.747 --> 00:41:31.977
That's how it all started, anyway.

437
00:41:35.367 --> 00:41:37.780
Gilbert told me that...

438
00:41:38.963 --> 00:41:42.738
you were..
He says you have a wife.


439
00:41:45.447 --> 00:41:46.452
I had a wife...

440
00:41:47.616 --> 00:41:48.189
once...

441
00:41:49.165 --> 00:41:50.010
that's a long story

442
00:41:50.837 --> 00:41:51.823
Well, I got all night.

443
00:41:57.935 --> 00:42:02.001
We were married about 4 years
and she was beautiful.


444
00:42:03.508 --> 00:42:04.053
Biddy...

445
00:42:05.548 --> 00:42:07.248
had a friend by the
name of Jim Taylor.


446
00:42:08.732 --> 00:42:09.915
He didn't live far from us...

447
00:42:12.675 --> 00:42:17.288
flesh-eatin' loudmouth type. He
would visit her when I was away.


448
00:42:22.967 --> 00:42:23.784
I got wise to them, though.

449
00:42:25.004 --> 00:42:28.159
Gave him a stern warning to stay away.
Gave Biddy the same.


450
00:42:33.502 --> 00:42:34.929
Can't say I was gentle about it, however.

451
00:42:41.109 --> 00:42:44.799
A short time afterwards, I was
away mustering wild horses,


452
00:42:48.055 --> 00:42:51.229
and while I was away,
she ran off with him.


453
00:42:52.478 --> 00:42:54.121
Worst of all, she
took my son with her.

454
00:42:57.366 --> 00:42:58.558
He was about 3, at the time.

455
00:43:00.953 --> 00:43:01.732
What did you do?

456
00:43:04.126 --> 00:43:05.356
Looked all over for them.

457
00:43:07.799 --> 00:43:09.339
For a long time,
I did nothing else.


458
00:43:10.437 --> 00:43:12.071
Not a single soul knew
where they'd gone.


459
00:43:13.095 --> 00:43:14.174
I'm sorry to hear that.

460
00:43:17.424 --> 00:43:19.875
I swore, the day I
found Jim Taylor,


461
00:43:21.762 --> 00:43:23.706
I'd put a bullet
in his wicked hide.


462
00:43:24.861 --> 00:43:27.669
You'll never know true hatred until
someone destroys your family.


463
00:43:40.176 --> 00:43:43.593
Ben, you know it's\
Christmas next week, don't you?


464
00:43:44.680 --> 00:43:46.407
I didn't realize.
Well, it is.


465
00:43:47.280 --> 00:43:49.600
And I was thinkin', we
oughta enjoy some festivities..


466
00:43:50.492 --> 00:43:51.074
for a change of pace.

467
00:43:52.398 --> 00:43:54.651
What do you say to that, Johnny?
Sounds grand to me.


468
00:43:55.956 --> 00:43:57.731
We're not all that far
away from Binda, are we?


469
00:43:58.228 --> 00:43:59.496
What do you say,
we drop in and...


470
00:44:00.444 --> 00:44:03.477
see some old friends.
Sounds like an idea.


471
00:44:05.104 --> 00:44:08.099
Yes, it is.
Brace yourself, Mr. Dunne!


472
00:44:08.441 --> 00:44:12.113
We are about to have ourselves
a very Merry Christmas!


473
00:44:34.886 --> 00:44:37.665
Benjamin, come in.
Where have you been?


474
00:44:41.999 --> 00:44:43.840
I was startin' to think you
were never coming back.


475
00:44:45.389 --> 00:44:46.459
I said I would, didn't I?

476
00:44:46.919 --> 00:44:49.164
But it's been so long, you had
me worried something happened.


477
00:44:51.520 --> 00:44:53.802
or maybe you went and found
yourself some other Doxie.


478
00:44:56.121 --> 00:44:56.919
There's no one else.

479
00:44:58.694 --> 00:45:00.731
What are you doin' here, sneakin'
up in the middle of the night?


480
00:45:02.038 --> 00:45:04.207
Gilbert and I are camped just
outside of town with a new fellow.


481
00:45:04.742 --> 00:45:06.207
I came to see if you'd
like to join us tomorrow.


482
00:45:06.779 --> 00:45:08.667
Of course, I'll bring
Ellen and Peggy too.


483
00:45:09.380 --> 00:45:10.592
Gilbert would
like that very much.


484
00:45:12.663 --> 00:45:14.926
And what about tonight?
You goin' back?


485
00:45:16.296 --> 00:45:17.235
Not if I don't have to.

486
00:45:24.910 --> 00:45:25.718
Have you missed me?

487
00:45:29.201 --> 00:45:29.924
What do you think?

488
00:45:31.782 --> 00:45:32.909
You wonder, sometimes...

489
00:45:33.698 --> 00:45:36.421
Seems you'd rather be out there in
the cold and rain than here with me.


490
00:45:41.200 --> 00:45:42.806
Can't exactly
live a normal life.


491
00:45:43.963 --> 00:45:45.062
I suppose not.

492
00:46:43.929 --> 00:46:44.821
Can't sleep?

493
00:46:47.651 --> 00:46:48.337
No.

494
00:46:49.135 --> 00:46:50.412
Your safe here, Ben.

495
00:46:51.520 --> 00:46:52.684
No one knows you're here.

496
00:46:53.745 --> 00:46:54.769
What is it, what's wrong?

497
00:46:56.780 --> 00:46:58.348
I'm alright.
No, you're not.


498
00:46:59.136 --> 00:47:00.545
I've never seen you like this.

499
00:47:01.174 --> 00:47:02.376
Some bad things
have happened, that's all.


500
00:47:03.230 --> 00:47:06.103
Like what?
You don't want to know.


501
00:47:06.878 --> 00:47:08.033
Yes, I do.

502
00:47:08.709 --> 00:47:10.015
Perhaps, I don't want
you to know.


503
00:47:10.785 --> 00:47:11.367
Why?

504
00:47:19.543 --> 00:47:20.041
Ben!

505
00:47:23.336 --> 00:47:24.717
I should go before first light.

506
00:47:38.448 --> 00:47:39.701
So, what's this Peggy girl like?

507
00:47:41.156 --> 00:47:42.170
Jack says she's pretty.

508
00:47:44.095 --> 00:47:44.846
She's pretty enough.

509
00:47:45.194 --> 00:47:48.086
And if she's anything like her sister,
you're in for a grand time.


510
00:47:53.810 --> 00:47:55.707
Woop! Careful,
don't spill it on me.


511
00:48:00.561 --> 00:48:03.725
Good Lord, would you look at
how long your hair is these days!


512
00:48:03.885 --> 00:48:06.411
I'm obliged to wear it long, for
I have times I need to dress


513
00:48:06.441 --> 00:48:08.598
in womens' clothes.
Oh, you do not!


514
00:48:08.628 --> 00:48:10.803
It's true, I
stand as a witness.


515
00:48:13.056 --> 00:48:15.469
Do you wear ladies' clothes?
Sometimes.


516
00:48:16.209 --> 00:48:17.054
Why?

517
00:48:17.288 --> 00:48:19.908
When I need to pass through
a town unrecognized, of course.


518
00:48:20.256 --> 00:48:22.866
And more, I fully intend

519
00:48:22.988 --> 00:48:26.875
to escape out of the country,
dressed in a petticoat.


520
00:48:28.207 --> 00:48:31.334
I bet you'd be the
ugliest girl I've ever seen!


521
00:48:32.113 --> 00:48:35.521
Some men showed interest.
You know what?


522
00:48:35.878 --> 00:48:38.563
You should all come to the
Boxing Day Ball with us next week,


523
00:48:38.863 --> 00:48:40.892
at the Flagg Hotel.
What do you say, Ben?


524
00:48:41.417 --> 00:48:43.626
Why not!
Happy now, huh,huh?


525
00:48:46.940 --> 00:48:49.044
For Christ's sake, Jack,
try to have a nice evening!


526
00:48:49.241 --> 00:48:51.232
Alright, alright!
We were leaving anyway.


527
00:48:53.182 --> 00:48:54.694
Her sweet honeypot
calls to me.


528
00:48:55.877 --> 00:48:58.252
You're such a vulgar man, Johnny Gilbert!
Yes!


529
00:48:58.412 --> 00:49:02.196
And you love a vulgar man. And I'm
the most vulgar man you've ever met!


530
00:49:02.914 --> 00:49:05.562
Put me down, you brute!
Oh, I plan to.


531
00:49:05.592 --> 00:49:06.557
Put me down!

532
00:49:06.587 --> 00:49:09.224
Come to think of it, I think it's
time we had some privacy, as well.


533
00:49:10.074 --> 00:49:10.994
Put me down!

534
00:49:13.109 --> 00:49:14.903
Look after your guest, John.
I will.


535
00:49:29.531 --> 00:49:31.643
Is it true that bushrangers
know how to treat ladies


536
00:49:31.673 --> 00:49:32.648
better than regular men?

537
00:49:34.472 --> 00:49:35.411
I don't know.

538
00:49:36.359 --> 00:49:37.927
Oh, well, that's what
Ellen claims, anyway.


539
00:49:38.472 --> 00:49:40.143
Says Gilbert knows
his way around quite well.


540
00:49:40.716 --> 00:49:43.054
I think bushrangers know how
to treat ladies pretty good.


541
00:49:45.030 --> 00:49:47.612
Go on, then.
Show me how.


542
00:50:16.740 --> 00:50:19.228
So? Tell us. Did you...

543
00:50:20.130 --> 00:50:21.857
tip the velvet,
get a bit of under?


544
00:50:22.139 --> 00:50:23.707
Shut up, Jack!
You did!


545
00:50:24.025 --> 00:50:25.265
You got her heels up!

546
00:50:25.396 --> 00:50:27.612
Ben, our little Johnny's
all grown up now.


547
00:50:40.475 --> 00:50:41.264
Goddammit!

548
00:50:42.738 --> 00:50:44.212
Doesn't anybody
use cash anymore?


549
00:50:44.487 --> 00:50:45.886
Now it's all worthless checks.

550
00:50:46.919 --> 00:50:48.215
At this rate,
we'll never have enough.


551
00:50:54.058 --> 00:50:54.818
you find something?

552
00:50:56.424 --> 00:50:57.935
I don't think you want
to hear this, Mr. Hall.


553
00:50:59.898 --> 00:51:00.461
Read it.

554
00:51:04.811 --> 00:51:07.384
Mrs. Hall, wife of Ben Hall,
the bushranger,


555
00:51:07.497 --> 00:51:09.666
accompanied by the
notorious Jim Taylor,


556
00:51:09.696 --> 00:51:11.685
took out a summons
against Bill Hall


557
00:51:11.715 --> 00:51:13.901
for the illegal detention
of Ben Hall's child...


558
00:51:14.645 --> 00:51:16.561
but the parties concerned
made no appearance.


559
00:51:17.002 --> 00:51:19.509
The child, having been
surrendered back to Taylor,


560
00:51:19.641 --> 00:51:21.321
who now assumes his guardianship.

561
00:51:54.199 --> 00:51:56.649
Jim, not in front of Henry!

562
00:51:57.241 --> 00:51:59.062
Take your drinking
outside, right now.


563
00:52:03.306 --> 00:52:04.828
I got things to do, anyway.

564
00:52:28.573 --> 00:52:28.893
Ben!

565
00:52:30.461 --> 00:52:32.724
Wait, listen to me!
Get your horse.


566
00:52:33.921 --> 00:52:34.803
We're going for a ride.

567
00:52:39.179 --> 00:52:40.071
A ride where?

568
00:52:40.392 --> 00:52:43.106
Get your bloody horse tethered or
...I'll be makin' it for you.


569
00:52:45.247 --> 00:52:47.003
Stay right here!
Benjamin!


570
00:52:47.387 --> 00:52:50.345
Benjamin, go, get out of here!
Go, go!


571
00:52:50.625 --> 00:52:52.775
I said get on your horse,
Taylor, right now!


572
00:52:52.805 --> 00:52:55.968
No, don't you shoot my father,
Ben Hall!


573
00:52:55.998 --> 00:52:57.360
Don't you shoot him!

574
00:52:57.505 --> 00:52:59.167
Don't you shoot my Dah!
Henry,


575
00:52:59.197 --> 00:53:01.336
I'm your Dah, I'm
your Dah, remember?


576
00:53:01.366 --> 00:53:01.994
No!

577
00:53:23.465 --> 00:53:24.489
You will tell him.

578
00:53:26.667 --> 00:53:28.620
You will tell him
who his father really is.


579
00:54:54.507 --> 00:54:55.755
Try it on, might be 7.

580
00:54:56.253 --> 00:54:58.093
You have such
beautiful things, Mrs. Morris.


581
00:54:58.123 --> 00:54:58.873
Oh, thank you.

582
00:55:01.473 --> 00:55:02.478
Evening, ladies.

583
00:55:04.496 --> 00:55:06.740
Heading to the Ball, later tonight?
Indeed, we are!


584
00:55:08.055 --> 00:55:11.050
Helen, you're not thinking of
wearing crenoline, are you?


585
00:55:12.013 --> 00:55:14.032
I am, I'm old enough.

586
00:55:14.285 --> 00:55:16.820
Leave them alone, Edward.
Let the ladies have their fun.


587
00:55:17.262 --> 00:55:20.276
So tell me, who are the
lucky fellas, taking you?


588
00:55:20.807 --> 00:55:22.873
Big surprise.
You'll see.


589
00:55:23.521 --> 00:55:24.985
Well, I can't wait
to meet them.


590
00:55:31.228 --> 00:55:32.871
Bail up.
Easy, easy!


591
00:55:33.115 --> 00:55:36.467
Stay calm, everyone, calm!

592
00:55:37.735 --> 00:55:39.678
Howdy, there,
Miss McKennon, Miss Knox.


593
00:55:39.866 --> 00:55:41.378
Evening, sir.
Evening, sir.


594
00:55:43.507 --> 00:55:44.230
I know you!

595
00:55:45.938 --> 00:55:48.652
Gilbert, John Gilbert!
I'm flattered you remember.


596
00:55:49.497 --> 00:55:50.784
I suppose you're Ben Hall.

597
00:55:52.118 --> 00:55:53.095
I am that gentleman.

598
00:55:57.001 --> 00:55:59.161
Any firearms on the premises?
No!


599
00:55:59.630 --> 00:56:01.555
Cash?
Only some silver.


600
00:56:02.461 --> 00:56:03.109
Only silver.

601
00:56:08.057 --> 00:56:09.362
A man in your position, Morris

602
00:56:22.298 --> 00:56:24.374
I've heard you keep your
money in strange places.


603
00:56:26.754 --> 00:56:28.294
Helen, you told them.
How could you?


604
00:56:28.435 --> 00:56:30.397
I would do nothing
of the sort Miss Morris.


605
00:56:31.580 --> 00:56:32.726
You can lock up for tonight.

606
00:56:34.322 --> 00:56:35.909
We'll be escorting you
and your wife to the Ball.


607
00:56:37.490 --> 00:56:38.532
What do you want from me?

608
00:56:38.889 --> 00:56:40.335
Far too dangerous,
leaving you outside,


609
00:56:41.818 --> 00:56:43.217
being a former policeman and all.

610
00:56:43.612 --> 00:56:45.490
Now, go let your wife
change her dress.


611
00:57:17.708 --> 00:57:21.370
Ladies and gentlemen, please
excuse our raucous entrance


612
00:57:21.539 --> 00:57:24.731
but I will have your
undivided attention.


613
00:57:26.167 --> 00:57:28.571
My name is John Gilbert

614
00:57:28.993 --> 00:57:32.214
and with me are my mates,
Ben Hall and John Dunn.


615
00:57:32.571 --> 00:57:34.355
No doubt, you
have heard of us.


616
00:57:35.007 --> 00:57:35.796
But don't be alarmed.

617
00:57:36.350 --> 00:57:38.096
We are here for
the same reason as you.,


618
00:57:39.805 --> 00:57:40.669
to have a bit of fun!

619
00:57:40.922 --> 00:57:42.819
No one is to leave
without my permission first.


620
00:57:45.091 --> 00:57:45.645
Do that

621
00:57:48.083 --> 00:57:49.069
and there'll be no trouble.

622
00:57:51.379 --> 00:57:52.121
Fiddler, proceed!

623
00:57:55.550 --> 00:57:56.714
Come now, ladies and gentlemen,

624
00:57:56.846 --> 00:57:58.630
let us all liquor and dance.

625
00:57:58.752 --> 00:57:59.738
first round is on me.

626
00:58:41.948 --> 00:58:43.751
John, you're up!

627
01:00:02.103 --> 01:00:03.174
Ben, how about a drink?

628
01:00:04.178 --> 01:00:05.584
A drink, a Morris?

629
01:00:07.889 --> 01:00:09.871
Boys, are you bloody mad?

630
01:00:10.331 --> 01:00:11.786
You know what their
capture is worth?


631
01:00:14.490 --> 01:00:16.650
25 hundred pounds!

632
01:00:17.497 --> 01:00:19.412
Now, I'll make a rush on them.

633
01:00:20.492 --> 01:00:21.976
Anyone game enough to join me?

634
01:00:22.107 --> 01:00:23.112
Sure, I'm in.

635
01:00:23.253 --> 01:00:25.685
For a slice of fed like that?
As am I.


636
01:00:25.826 --> 01:00:26.089
Good.

637
01:00:33.961 --> 01:00:36.674
Pistols goin' off around
women and children, Morris...


638
01:00:36.704 --> 01:00:37.848
They've been drinkin'.

639
01:00:38.319 --> 01:00:39.465
They won't be themselves.

640
01:00:39.624 --> 01:00:40.854
They're not doing any harm.

641
01:00:41.089 --> 01:00:43.258
Oh, right, if we sit
here and do nothing,


642
01:00:43.925 --> 01:00:46.732
What does it make us, hm?
Cowards!


643
01:00:49.666 --> 01:00:52.380
Leave him, leave him,
leave him be.


644
01:00:53.262 --> 01:00:54.380
we bide our time.

645
01:00:54.953 --> 01:00:56.220
Let them drink a little more.

646
01:00:56.436 --> 01:00:58.286
You fellas take
Gilbert and Dunn.


647
01:01:01.331 --> 01:01:02.504
Leave Ben Hall to me.

648
01:01:42.833 --> 01:01:44.899
What's wrong?
Wait right here.


649
01:01:48.260 --> 01:01:49.058
Morris!

650
01:01:50.391 --> 01:01:52.457
Stand, you bloody dog
or I'll shoot you!


651
01:01:53.100 --> 01:01:55.794
We hear whispers of dirty talk
coming from this room.


652
01:01:56.668 --> 01:01:57.297
Morris!

653
01:02:05.271 --> 01:02:07.149
For those of who who crave
to take our lives


654
01:02:07.179 --> 01:02:08.586
for the blood money
on our hides,


655
01:02:09.534 --> 01:02:11.778
have the courage to step
forward and take it now.


656
01:02:16.349 --> 01:02:17.091
What are you waiting for?

657
01:02:21.213 --> 01:02:21.767
Take it now.

658
01:02:35.269 --> 01:02:37.888
Any man, thirsting for the blood
money on my head, can earn it.


659
01:02:39.197 --> 01:02:43.281
I'll fight you all on the street,
one after the other.


660
01:02:46.682 --> 01:02:49.067
Did we tell you to stop?
Keep playing!


661
01:03:05.107 --> 01:03:09.867
<i>As I was crossing over
the Abercrombie mountains,</i>


662
01:03:09.897 --> 01:03:14.440
<i>I met Sir Fredrick Pottinger
and his money he was counting</i>


663
01:03:14.571 --> 01:03:18.986
<i>I then produced my pistol
to acquaint him of his danger</i>


664
01:03:19.016 --> 01:03:23.756
<i>saying stand and deliver
for I am a Beauford stranger</i>


665
01:03:33.420 --> 01:03:37.934
<i>Now it's early the next morning
about six o'clock or seven</i>


666
01:03:38.111 --> 01:03:42.790
<i>There were troopers all around me
in numbers odd and even</i>


667
01:03:42.909 --> 01:03:47.853
<i>but Jenny had got 3 charges
and she dampened them with water</i>


668
01:03:47.883 --> 01:03:52.730
<i>Oh, the devil will take her mother
or favorite sons or daughters</i>


669
01:04:09.459 --> 01:04:11.976
<i>...on the Abercrombie mountain</i>

670
01:04:12.006 --> 01:04:17.065
but they didn't take my piss from me
and I knocked down all their...


671
01:04:17.095 --> 01:04:21.962
and I made up all my...
to Sir Fred and all his gentry


672
01:04:32.291 --> 01:04:33.449
Where's Morris?

673
01:04:43.084 --> 01:04:44.586
Jack, Morris is gone!

674
01:04:45.356 --> 01:04:46.088
Move, move!

675
01:04:55.374 --> 01:04:56.407
Morris!

676
01:05:01.796 --> 01:05:02.839
Morris!

677
01:05:03.652 --> 01:05:05.107
get back here, now!

678
01:05:08.337 --> 01:05:10.027
Morris, you bastard!

679
01:05:16.334 --> 01:05:17.789
This is your last chance!

680
01:05:34.249 --> 01:05:35.385
What happened, where is he?

681
01:05:35.629 --> 01:05:37.535
The bastard was trying
to set loose our horses.


682
01:05:37.817 --> 01:05:39.066
He's gone!
Christ,


683
01:05:39.096 --> 01:05:41.160
he'll have every troop from
Golburn down here in no time


684
01:05:41.629 --> 01:05:43.714
So much for our fine evening!
So, what do we do?


685
01:05:44.326 --> 01:05:46.167
I'm going to burn his store
down to bloody stumps,


686
01:05:46.608 --> 01:05:48.692
right now!
Keep everyone here.


687
01:05:48.993 --> 01:05:50.974
Please, please, I beg you!

688
01:05:51.249 --> 01:05:53.287
Don't burn it down.
You'll ruin us.


689
01:05:53.559 --> 01:05:54.996
Your husband is
nothing but a dog


690
01:05:55.296 --> 01:05:57.785
and if I ever come across him again,
that day will be his last.


691
01:05:57.909 --> 01:06:01.393
Please, don't do this to us.
Please!


692
01:06:03.336 --> 01:06:05.233
Nobody leaves this building
for the next hour.


693
01:06:44.301 --> 01:06:46.855
Do it in,
serves the bugger right!


694
01:06:47.165 --> 01:06:48.480
Yeah, serves him right!

695
01:08:35.341 --> 01:08:36.017
Who could that be?

696
01:08:36.843 --> 01:08:37.961
I know who I hope it is.

697
01:08:45.699 --> 01:08:47.267
Who are you?
What do you want?


698
01:08:52.017 --> 01:08:54.599
You're all charged with aiding
and abetting the Hall gang


699
01:08:54.629 --> 01:08:56.524
and the commission of arson.
You're under arrest


700
01:08:56.554 --> 01:08:58.026
and will be coming
with us to Galban.


701
01:08:58.712 --> 01:08:59.407
that is all.

702
01:09:02.856 --> 01:09:03.429
Hey...

703
01:09:03.720 --> 01:09:06.180
I didn't... I wasn't...
I wasn't there...


704
01:09:40.191 --> 01:09:42.059
Godd evening, Miss.
Good evening, sir.


705
01:09:43.346 --> 01:09:45.580
So, who are you, then?
Harry Nelson.


706
01:09:45.610 --> 01:09:47.984
Well Harry Nelson, you'll be
minding our horses.


707
01:09:48.275 --> 01:09:49.402
Got that?
Alright.


708
01:09:49.862 --> 01:09:51.637
You make a run for it,
we'll let them loose.


709
01:09:53.909 --> 01:09:54.754
I'll blow your brains out.

710
01:09:58.590 --> 01:10:02.121
Everybody, outside!
This instant!


711
01:10:02.151 --> 01:10:03.764
Faster! Move!

712
01:10:04.534 --> 01:10:05.989
Come on! Move! Move!

713
01:10:06.884 --> 01:10:08.321
Move!
Bring it in there.


714
01:10:11.072 --> 01:10:12.875
Alright, everyone. listen up!

715
01:10:13.391 --> 01:10:15.551
Empty out the
contents of your jacket


716
01:10:15.953 --> 01:10:18.038
place it in your hats.
Hold them out for me to see.


717
01:10:18.282 --> 01:10:20.742
I catch anyone holdin' out on me,
you'll get a good throttlin'.


718
01:10:20.772 --> 01:10:22.742
Understand? Good!
Miss? Step inside, please.


719
01:10:23.334 --> 01:10:25.343
Alright, report!
Starting with you.


720
01:10:26.444 --> 01:10:28.989
What's that? What have
you got? Let's see it!


721
01:10:38.945 --> 01:10:40.767
Would you be kind enough to
open all the others for me?


722
01:10:41.659 --> 01:10:42.335
Of course.

723
01:11:25.934 --> 01:11:28.160
What is it, Samuel
Those were gunshots, just now.


724
01:11:28.491 --> 01:11:30.557
I swear, it's a dream.
Mr. Nelson!


725
01:11:32.360 --> 01:11:34.885
Mr. Nelson! Mr. Nelson!

726
01:11:35.129 --> 01:11:36.688
There are bushrangers
at Kelly's Hotel


727
01:11:36.885 --> 01:11:38.651
and them boys
had Harry with them!


728
01:11:39.312 --> 01:11:41.068
Christ, what was all
that racket about Johnny?


729
01:11:41.246 --> 01:11:42.814
I chased up a fella
headed this way.


730
01:11:42.844 --> 01:11:43.518
Oh, you did?

731
01:11:44.382 --> 01:11:44.974
good for ya!

732
01:11:45.475 --> 01:11:47.457
The traps'll be here any minute,
I'm telling ya!


733
01:11:47.487 --> 01:11:49.550
Not likely, they're all out in
the bush, looking for us.


734
01:11:49.580 --> 01:11:51.494
You don't know that!
Yes, I do.


735
01:11:51.524 --> 01:11:53.907
Jack, call us all downstairs.

736
01:11:58.458 --> 01:11:59.594
Ben, Johnny
wants to see you.


737
01:12:00.223 --> 01:12:02.082
I don't know.
Ask him about it.


738
01:12:02.631 --> 01:12:04.559
Please Sam, you don't
go out there by yourself.


739
01:12:04.589 --> 01:12:06.340
At least, wait for the
others to get back.


740
01:12:06.370 --> 01:12:09.229
It'll be too late by then,
they've got our boy, Lizzy.


741
01:12:10.382 --> 01:12:12.307
Plesse, Sam, you don't go up there!
now, look,


742
01:12:12.337 --> 01:12:14.354
Now, look, I'm just
going to do my best.


743
01:12:15.264 --> 01:12:15.790
Wait here.

744
01:12:19.030 --> 01:12:19.969
What's the trouble, John?

745
01:12:20.099 --> 01:12:21.216
We got what bwe came for.

746
01:12:21.348 --> 01:12:22.906
Why the hell are
we lagging around?


747
01:12:23.216 --> 01:12:25.188
Jack wants to find himself
a pair of boots to his liking.


748
01:12:25.319 --> 01:12:28.418
Mr. Hall, if there are any traps in town,
they'll be all over us, any time now.


749
01:12:28.606 --> 01:12:29.949
Then go outside and
keep good watch.


750
01:12:41.074 --> 01:12:42.426
Dad, Dad, have you heard?

751
01:12:42.595 --> 01:12:44.013
Hall's gang have
bailed up the hotel


752
01:12:44.043 --> 01:12:45.083
i'm on my way there now.

753
01:12:45.113 --> 01:12:47.017
they've got your brother with them.
Can I come with you?


754
01:12:47.047 --> 01:12:48.567
Alright, but keep
at a good distance.


755
01:12:58.285 --> 01:12:59.637
Jack, we got company!

756
01:13:01.933 --> 01:13:02.356
Jack!

757
01:13:24.079 --> 01:13:26.050
Not one step closer!

758
01:13:26.379 --> 01:13:26.858
Wait here.

759
01:13:27.787 --> 01:13:30.088
Get back or
I'll shoot you!


760
01:13:32.358 --> 01:13:33.325
Dad!

761
01:13:45.578 --> 01:13:46.245
Dad!

762
01:14:10.555 --> 01:14:11.109
Ben?

763
01:14:19.301 --> 01:14:20.409
That's my Da.

764
01:14:21.273 --> 01:14:22.437
That's my Da!

765
01:14:22.747 --> 01:14:25.245
You shot my Da, you bastard!

766
01:14:25.275 --> 01:14:26.822
God damn you,boy!

767
01:14:27.076 --> 01:14:30.071
Nelson was a husband and
a father of 8 children!


768
01:14:30.922 --> 01:14:32.143
John, what's going on?

769
01:14:32.904 --> 01:14:35.674
Shot one of the bloody traps.
The other one bolted.


770
01:14:39.704 --> 01:14:40.718
Da's dead!

771
01:14:58.640 --> 01:15:00.762
Ah, just what I wanted, ah!

772
01:15:02.058 --> 01:15:04.152
What are you doing?
What does it look like?


773
01:15:05.232 --> 01:15:06.321
Now, I can't use it anymore.

774
01:15:25.463 --> 01:15:26.778
What the bloody hell was that?

775
01:15:26.909 --> 01:15:28.318
I didn't know what to do,
I'm sorry!


776
01:15:28.458 --> 01:15:30.336
It just happened!
You're wanted for murder, John.


777
01:15:30.834 --> 01:15:32.609
That means when they
catch you, they'll hang you.


778
01:15:33.153 --> 01:15:33.886
What were you thinking?

779
01:15:33.916 --> 01:15:36.433
You left me alone out there!
What was I supposed to do?


780
01:15:36.463 --> 01:15:38.292
You coulda just shot him
in the leg for Christ's sake.


781
01:15:38.322 --> 01:15:40.499
Instead, you blew the poor
bastard to kingdom come!


782
01:15:40.529 --> 01:15:42.142
I said I was sorry, alright?

783
01:15:42.172 --> 01:15:43.545
No need to be sorry, Johnny.

784
01:15:43.936 --> 01:15:45.395
You did what
was needed, that's all.


785
01:15:47.058 --> 01:15:48.952
You want the
whole country against us, Jack.


786
01:15:48.982 --> 01:15:49.825
Is that what you want?

787
01:15:49.855 --> 01:15:50.920
It already is!

788
01:15:52.466 --> 01:15:53.605
And if they're
coming for us,


789
01:15:54.219 --> 01:15:56.305
I'm taking as many traps
with me as I can.


790
01:15:57.016 --> 01:15:58.851
God damn you,
the pair of you!


791
01:16:00.730 --> 01:16:02.224
You're as mad as
you are stupid!


792
01:16:02.890 --> 01:16:04.310
You think you're innocent
in all this?


793
01:16:04.632 --> 01:16:06.422
That you ain't got
no blood on your hands?


794
01:16:06.452 --> 01:16:08.849
I may not be innocent but
I've never killed a man.


795
01:16:08.879 --> 01:16:09.559
So what?

796
01:16:11.534 --> 01:16:13.709
You've taken shots at hundreds of them,

797
01:16:14.079 --> 01:16:16.727
Could've killed any
one of them at any time.


798
01:16:18.232 --> 01:16:19.593
But you always
were a lousy shot.


799
01:16:20.022 --> 01:16:22.094
I never miss
anything I fix to hit.


800
01:16:22.508 --> 01:16:24.358
I see. So, you're
just a coward, then.


801
01:16:27.154 --> 01:16:27.805
Say it again.

802
01:16:30.466 --> 01:16:31.428
Say it again, Jack.

803
01:16:33.544 --> 01:16:34.831
I said say it again!

804
01:16:47.964 --> 01:16:48.719
Where are you going?

805
01:17:12.218 --> 01:17:14.097
John, Come in quickly!

806
01:17:17.929 --> 01:17:18.358
John...

807
01:17:21.333 --> 01:17:22.235
What's happened?

808
01:17:25.370 --> 01:17:26.229
What have you done?

809
01:17:29.987 --> 01:17:30.934
I shot a man.

810
01:17:33.432 --> 01:17:33.906
A trap?

811
01:17:34.816 --> 01:17:35.585
I'm sorry.

812
01:17:40.981 --> 01:17:41.884
Think I will stay here..

813
01:17:44.502 --> 01:17:45.790
No, you've gotta run.

814
01:17:46.087 --> 01:17:48.484
John, get away from the country
as fast as you can.


815
01:17:48.514 --> 01:17:49.831
Come with me, please.

816
01:17:50.186 --> 01:17:52.672
We'll go north, we'll
start a new life together.


817
01:17:53.101 --> 01:17:55.009
I'll look after you, Pegs.
I swear it.


818
01:17:55.389 --> 01:17:58.052
What about my sister?
She can come too.


819
01:17:58.659 --> 01:17:59.961
John, haven't you heard?

820
01:18:00.967 --> 01:18:03.601
3 weeks ago, we were all arrested
for what happened in Binda.


821
01:18:04.128 --> 01:18:06.392
Then let me go free
but Ellen and Chrissy...


822
01:18:06.866 --> 01:18:08.967
they've been sent to
Sydney to stand trial.


823
01:18:12.734 --> 01:18:14.614
We didn't know
we'd get them hurt.


824
01:18:20.915 --> 01:18:23.978
Come with me, please.

825
01:18:26.316 --> 01:18:30.103
I can't, I'm sorry.

826
01:18:52.833 --> 01:18:54.771
You say you want to
escape the country, Ben...


827
01:18:55.393 --> 01:18:56.044
do you mean that?

828
01:18:56.584 --> 01:18:57.915
Or is that just
cock and bull talk?


829
01:18:58.847 --> 01:19:00.949
No, it's true.
Good!


830
01:19:04.828 --> 01:19:07.210
Christine is in jail,
Ellen too.


831
01:19:07.965 --> 01:19:08.823
I thought you ought to know that.

832
01:19:27.382 --> 01:19:34.662
Three long steps
I step it up to her


833
01:19:34.858 --> 01:19:41.014
Though knowing her
as she must be mine


834
01:19:41.165 --> 01:19:48.105
i would make you as happy
as any lady


835
01:19:48.632 --> 01:19:55.468
If you would grant me
one small rally


836
01:19:56.720 --> 01:20:04.207
She said: "Stand off,
you are deceiptful,


837
01:20:04.793 --> 01:20:10.949
you are deceiptful
and a false young man


838
01:20:10.979 --> 01:20:17.913
It is you that's caused
my poor heart for to wonder.


839
01:20:21.459 --> 01:20:24.019
Mr. Hall, there's more troopers
headed this way,


840
01:20:24.049 --> 01:20:25.084
not 2 miles off.

841
01:20:26.750 --> 01:20:28.807
God damn it,
we just got here!


842
01:20:29.266 --> 01:20:32.077
You can stay at my place tonught.
Come, on.


843
01:20:34.620 --> 01:20:35.818
May the Good Lord Bless you.

844
01:20:38.792 --> 01:20:41.086
Once they've passed through
the area, give us the all clear.


845
01:20:42.092 --> 01:20:42.580
Good lad.

846
01:20:57.477 --> 01:20:59.993
Well, we can say the gang was here
not more than 2 hours ago.


847
01:21:00.230 --> 01:21:01.029
And they were tipped off.

848
01:21:01.206 --> 01:21:02.582
Any idea where they went, sir?

849
01:21:03.115 --> 01:21:05.719
Couldn't tell you, sir.
Who tipped them off?


850
01:21:06.606 --> 01:21:07.968
Couldn't tell you that, either.

851
01:21:08.264 --> 01:21:10.912
Arrest him. I want everyone
here questioned.


852
01:21:11.548 --> 01:21:13.753
Their telegraph is still here,
I'll wager that.


853
01:21:17.528 --> 01:21:20.576
Him! That one, right there!

854
01:21:21.375 --> 01:21:22.278
You, there!

855
01:21:27.574 --> 01:21:28.595
What's your name, lad?

856
01:21:30.193 --> 01:21:31.953
Suttle.
Suttle.


857
01:21:32.957 --> 01:21:34.762
You got 2 choices, Mr. Suttle...

858
01:21:34.792 --> 01:21:37.855
you can tell us where they went
and we let you walk free


859
01:21:38.269 --> 01:21:38.979
no charges.

860
01:21:40.059 --> 01:21:43.536
You're facing 7 years in jail for
aiding and abetting bushrangers.


861
01:21:44.937 --> 01:21:48.725
So, what's it gonna be?
Where'd they go, Mr. Suttle?


862
01:22:01.763 --> 01:22:02.178
Ben!

863
01:22:02.740 --> 01:22:04.249
Don't you shoot my Da!

864
01:22:07.253 --> 01:22:09.339
Benjamin!
<i>Benjamin!</i>


865
01:23:45.915 --> 01:23:46.596
Look out!

866
01:23:53.521 --> 01:23:54.645
Johnny, get your head down!

867
01:23:55.378 --> 01:23:56.724
Get into the fight, Johnny!

868
01:24:01.610 --> 01:24:02.187
Come on!

869
01:24:05.723 --> 01:24:06.108
Jack!

870
01:24:06.655 --> 01:24:07.514
They're all over us!

871
01:24:09.038 --> 01:24:10.532
We have to get out of here,
right now!


872
01:24:11.122 --> 01:24:13.845
Give yourselves up!
We've got you surrounded!


873
01:24:16.893 --> 01:24:17.943
They're surrounding us!

874
01:24:22.260 --> 01:24:23.236
Both of you,get out!

875
01:24:23.917 --> 01:24:25.322
No, it's murder out there.

876
01:24:25.633 --> 01:24:27.572
We have to or they'll
trap us like bloody rats.


877
01:24:28.001 --> 01:24:28.903
Come on!

878
01:24:30.067 --> 01:24:31.192
Go! Now!

879
01:24:31.532 --> 01:24:32.257
Follow me!

880
01:24:35.788 --> 01:24:36.942
They're getting out!

881
01:24:41.217 --> 01:24:42.327
Go on, Jim. Go on!

882
01:25:35.742 --> 01:25:36.955
Jesus, Ben's been hit!

883
01:25:37.843 --> 01:25:39.544
Where in the hell
did they come from?


884
01:25:39.574 --> 01:25:42.592
Burns must have sold us out!
Bloody bastard!


885
01:25:54.211 --> 01:25:57.319
We need to get back to the horses.
No chance, just run!


886
01:25:58.636 --> 01:25:59.139
Run!

887
01:26:21.549 --> 01:26:22.851
Keep running, Johnny, go!

888
01:26:26.396 --> 01:26:27.944
Come on, you bastards!

889
01:26:28.610 --> 01:26:29.468
I'm over here.

890
01:26:34.242 --> 01:26:36.032
You want a bloody fight?
Come on!


891
01:26:51.623 --> 01:26:53.118
Just run, Jack. Go!

892
01:26:53.918 --> 01:26:55.442
Christ's sake, don't lose that!

893
01:27:28.389 --> 01:27:29.691
Where are we going?

894
01:27:32.438 --> 01:27:35.797
Hearse Hill isn't far from here.
We can get horses there.


895
01:27:36.655 --> 01:27:37.276
Come on!

896
01:28:08.621 --> 01:28:09.642
Wait! Stop!

897
01:28:20.007 --> 01:28:23.159
Benny, I can feel the ball,

898
01:28:23.499 --> 01:28:26.066
It's hit the bone...
Shit.


899
01:28:26.096 --> 01:28:28.004
Devil of a thing
to get hold of...


900
01:28:28.034 --> 01:28:29.114
Do what you have to.

901
01:28:29.810 --> 01:28:31.437
Just get the bastard thing out.

902
01:28:32.190 --> 01:28:33.433
Bite on this.

903
01:28:37.340 --> 01:28:38.139
Ready?

904
01:28:57.262 --> 01:28:58.129
Oh,yes.

905
01:28:59.269 --> 01:29:02.938
Oh, yes, my little darlin'.
Hold your hand out.


906
01:29:07.280 --> 01:29:10.876
Send that back to the traps, huh?
Alright?


907
01:29:15.605 --> 01:29:17.588
Detective James Pye...

908
01:29:17.958 --> 01:29:19.645
he's the fella
that had a go at you.


909
01:29:19.911 --> 01:29:22.678
Oh, he's also the
one who arrested Gardner.


910
01:29:23.166 --> 01:29:24.557
At Akers Creek, last year.

911
01:29:25.779 --> 01:29:28.368
Something else here,
you should know...


912
01:29:32.402 --> 01:29:36.915
Parliament has moved to pass
the Felons Apprehension Act,


913
01:29:37.404 --> 01:29:38.730
which would
summon and command


914
01:29:38.760 --> 01:29:42.074
John Gilbert, Benjamin Hall
and John Dunn to serve...


915
01:29:42.622 --> 01:29:43.791
surrender...

916
01:29:45.744 --> 01:29:49.510
to surrender themselves to
abide their trial respectively


917
01:29:49.939 --> 01:29:52.291
for the felony and murder
so charged upon them.


918
01:29:52.735 --> 01:29:55.028
If by the set date,
they have not surrendered,


919
01:29:55.058 --> 01:29:56.597
they will be declared outlaws,

920
01:29:57.411 --> 01:30:00.947
after which, any citizen may
apprehend or take said outlaws,


921
01:30:02.244 --> 01:30:02.969
dead or alive,

922
01:30:03.753 --> 01:30:07.348
without being accountable
for using any deadly weapon.


923
01:30:10.746 --> 01:30:13.394
What the hell does that mean?
It means that anyone can kill you.


924
01:30:14.134 --> 01:30:16.901
Anyone, no charges will be laid.

925
01:30:17.176 --> 01:30:18.715
What the hell gives them
the right to do that?


926
01:30:19.041 --> 01:30:21.675
They can't do that to us!
You hear? Thay can't!


927
01:30:21.705 --> 01:30:22.770
They bloody well can!

928
01:30:24.599 --> 01:30:25.309
And they will.

929
01:30:26.079 --> 01:30:30.977
...as this passed. You got

930
01:30:31.007 --> 01:30:34.232
We are not turning ourselves
in top, none of us are!


931
01:30:35.304 --> 01:30:36.709
Certainly not
while we have these.


932
01:30:57.661 --> 01:30:59.895
We need to get out of the country
well before this Act is passed.


933
01:31:00.369 --> 01:31:03.106
I agree but with what?
We lost everything at Byrnes'


934
01:31:03.520 --> 01:31:06.169
and we need a whole lot more.
What are you thinking, Ben?


935
01:31:07.115 --> 01:31:09.098
That we try something we
should've done a long time ago...


936
01:31:12.649 --> 01:31:14.543
sticking up a gold escort.
Which one?


937
01:31:15.307 --> 01:31:17.808
An escort leaves the Araloo in Deaton's
every week, bound for Sydney.


938
01:31:19.036 --> 01:31:20.693
Goes over the Blue Mountains,
through Majaor's Creek,


939
01:31:21.448 --> 01:31:22.706
that's where we hit it.
Perfect!


940
01:31:23.795 --> 01:31:26.148
You're not bloody serious!
You got a better idea?


941
01:31:26.178 --> 01:31:27.864
We've done this before,
Johnny. Don't worry.


942
01:31:28.101 --> 01:31:29.891
I would gather in\
half a dozen others...


943
01:31:30.069 --> 01:31:31.268
there's only 3 of us.

944
01:31:31.298 --> 01:31:34.005
Then, we'll get more fellas.
One more, to do it.


945
01:31:36.152 --> 01:31:37.099
Someone we can trust.

946
01:31:39.082 --> 01:31:40.502
Well, what about Daniel Ryan?

947
01:31:41.553 --> 01:31:42.884
He's be game for it,
I know he would.


948
01:31:43.180 --> 01:31:43.802
Know where he is?

949
01:31:44.947 --> 01:31:47.522
I think so, up in Berra
last I heard.


950
01:31:48.809 --> 01:31:49.593
Then go and get him.

951
01:31:56.211 --> 01:32:01.020
Ben, this is my mate, Dan Ryan.
It's nice to meet you, Mr. Hall.


952
01:32:02.485 --> 01:32:04.305
Dunn tells me you're up
for a bit of cross work


953
01:32:04.675 --> 01:32:05.903
Aye, the more, the merrier.

954
01:32:06.870 --> 01:32:08.291
Know what you're
getting yourself into, lad?


955
01:32:09.267 --> 01:32:09.785
I'm game.

956
01:32:14.195 --> 01:32:14.949
Welcome to the gang.

957
01:33:04.873 --> 01:33:08.942
You ok, mate?
Yeah, right as rain, mate.


958
01:33:47.669 --> 01:33:49.741
Let's do this fast
and do it right.


959
01:34:29.546 --> 01:34:29.945
Hey!

960
01:34:32.239 --> 01:34:33.452
Look out! Look out!

961
01:34:36.678 --> 01:34:37.343
Get down!

962
01:34:38.211 --> 01:34:38.684
Here!

963
01:34:39.838 --> 01:34:42.457
Come on, move up!
Move up, come on, boys!


964
01:34:44.264 --> 01:34:45.263
Lead on, Kay!

965
01:34:47.246 --> 01:34:48.489
Keep your heads on Kelly!

966
01:35:11.297 --> 01:35:12.377
Fuckin' hell!

967
01:35:15.677 --> 01:35:16.639
Mr. Hall!

968
01:35:18.224 --> 01:35:19.156
There's 2 more!

969
01:35:46.509 --> 01:35:48.300
Jesus! Ben,
they're getting closer!


970
01:35:54.475 --> 01:35:57.641
It's no bloody good,
get back to the horses.


971
01:35:57.671 --> 01:35:58.795
Come on, Ryan.

972
01:36:09.553 --> 01:36:11.151
Watch! We've
got them on the run!


973
01:36:13.005 --> 01:36:14.914
Move up! Move!

974
01:36:59.722 --> 01:37:00.269
Mr. Hall...

975
01:37:05.612 --> 01:37:06.781
so where we headed to next?

976
01:37:08.157 --> 01:37:11.176
We are heading north.
Yeah, that's right,


977
01:37:11.960 --> 01:37:15.319
You are going back to Marinbara.
Excuse me?


978
01:37:16.519 --> 01:37:20.025
You're going back home,
first thing tomorrow.


979
01:37:21.535 --> 01:37:22.511
Yeah, like hell I am!

980
01:37:26.003 --> 01:37:27.734
Look, I don't care what
happened with the escort, alright?


981
01:37:28.678 --> 01:37:30.291
I said I'd ride with you
and I'm a man of my word.


982
01:37:32.170 --> 01:37:34.212
Johhnyy Dunn is my good mate,
same as you and Gilbert.


983
01:37:34.242 --> 01:37:36.372
I don't walk away from mates.
Dan,


984
01:37:36.757 --> 01:37:37.911
you don't want to
become what we have


985
01:37:38.372 --> 01:37:40.339
No, I do, that's why I'm here.
That's why I've come here.


986
01:37:40.931 --> 01:37:41.952
Then, you'll do it your own way.

987
01:37:46.066 --> 01:37:47.664
I'm not taking any
more mates to hell with me


988
01:38:25.021 --> 01:38:26.486
We'll cross over the Harvey Ranges here,

989
01:38:27.403 --> 01:38:29.948
girding around Wellington
on the McCrory River.


990
01:38:30.529 --> 01:38:35.234
From there, we head east
to the Mirror Valley, then north,


991
01:38:36.818 --> 01:38:39.141
Straight for Queensland.
That's one hell of a ride.


992
01:38:39.644 --> 01:38:42.729
If we push hard enough, we can
be across the border in a fortnight.


993
01:38:44.595 --> 01:38:46.874
From there, we buy our passage out.
With what?


994
01:38:47.170 --> 01:38:49.833
If we bailed up everyone between here and
Queensland, we still won't have enough.


995
01:38:50.368 --> 01:38:51.951
No damn way, we're
getting out of the country.


996
01:38:52.380 --> 01:38:53.342
I have some stowed away.

997
01:38:55.339 --> 01:38:56.286
How much?

998
01:38:57.796 --> 01:38:59.408
Probably not
enough to get us out.


999
01:39:00.336 --> 01:39:02.837
I don't know, maybe.

1000
01:39:06.284 --> 01:39:10.383
Where is it?
Buried at Mick Coneley's


1001
01:39:11.971 --> 01:39:13.924
You trust Goobang Mick
with that lot?


1002
01:39:15.078 --> 01:39:16.336
He's like family to me

1003
01:39:16.366 --> 01:39:18.150
and he's never once
taken a penny of it.


1004
01:39:18.979 --> 01:39:20.725
We could have been halfway
across the sea by now!


1005
01:39:20.961 --> 01:39:23.181
We nearly got our heads blown off
going after that escort!


1006
01:39:23.211 --> 01:39:25.852
You never wanted
to leave anyway.


1007
01:39:26.192 --> 01:39:28.219
It's you that doesn't
want to leave because you


1008
01:39:28.456 --> 01:39:29.728
can't let Biddy go,

1009
01:39:32.037 --> 01:39:32.614
can you?

1010
01:39:35.429 --> 01:39:38.862
Now, I say it's high time we got
the fuck out of New South Wales.


1011
01:39:40.963 --> 01:39:41.866
Let's go, Johnny.

1012
01:40:32.209 --> 01:40:34.902
You're to be outlawed, Ben,
all three of you.


1013
01:40:35.863 --> 01:40:37.219
First outlaws in the colony.

1014
01:40:38.092 --> 01:40:40.104
This country certainly doesn't
want us anymore, does it.


1015
01:40:40.489 --> 01:40:43.552
Can you blame them?
You raised some hell out there.


1016
01:40:44.543 --> 01:40:46.200
I can't be helpin'
you anymore, Ben.


1017
01:40:46.933 --> 01:40:49.907
Every time you show up,
you put my family at risk.


1018
01:40:51.401 --> 01:40:52.999
I just need your help
one last time, Mick.


1019
01:40:54.287 --> 01:40:56.092
After that, the 3 of us
will be gone forever.


1020
01:40:57.524 --> 01:41:00.469
I swear it.
What do you need?


1021
01:41:29.904 --> 01:41:32.878
Leaving the Colony for good, Mick tells me.
Very soon.


1022
01:41:33.885 --> 01:41:36.237
I'm sorry, you'll be missed.

1023
01:41:38.641 --> 01:41:42.088
By as many as I think?
I'll miss you, for one.


1024
01:41:44.145 --> 01:41:45.299
It's kind of you to say so.

1025
01:41:49.724 --> 01:41:53.823
Do you remember, years ago,
my uncle set your broken leg.


1026
01:41:55.075 --> 01:41:58.182
I remember you lying up there
on our kitchen table, your


1027
01:41:58.729 --> 01:42:02.162
poor leg all wrapped up tight.
How old were you?


1028
01:42:03.103 --> 01:42:04.183
Thirteen?
Fourteen.


1029
01:42:08.874 --> 01:42:09.880
No, not reaaly.

1030
01:42:12.130 --> 01:42:14.616
I fancied you something
terrible in those days.


1031
01:42:15.711 --> 01:42:19.025
Can't imagine how I cried when
I heard you married Biddy Walsh.


1032
01:42:21.259 --> 01:42:23.287
I was convinced
you'd notice me,


1033
01:42:24.168 --> 01:42:25.411
one day, when I'd grown up...

1034
01:42:28.134 --> 01:42:29.569
Wasn't meant to be, I suppose.

1035
01:42:30.729 --> 01:42:32.061
I've always has some other plans,

1036
01:42:36.100 --> 01:42:36.958
Always for the best.

1037
01:42:44.601 --> 01:42:47.560
I wouldn't have broken
your heart the way she did.


1038
01:43:02.309 --> 01:43:03.922
Everything alright?
Yes!


1039
01:43:03.952 --> 01:43:06.319
Just getting a blessed
speck out from his eye.


1040
01:43:07.503 --> 01:43:08.021
Go on...

1041
01:43:14.875 --> 01:43:16.458
Thanks for seeing to that.
Quite alright.


1042
01:43:29.949 --> 01:43:31.606
The rest will be waiting
or you when you get back.


1043
01:43:32.198 --> 01:43:33.899
Thank you, Mick.
We won't be too long.


1044
01:43:35.232 --> 01:43:35.883
A week.

1045
01:43:37.150 --> 01:43:37.771
Two, at most.

1046
01:43:53.058 --> 01:43:54.656
I need to ride to Forbes tomorrow.

1047
01:43:55.216 --> 01:43:55.793
What for?

1048
01:43:56.000 --> 01:43:57.894
The boys need me to
pick up some more supplies


1049
01:43:58.190 --> 01:44:01.060
I'll come with you.
No, much faster if I ride alone.


1050
01:44:01.800 --> 01:44:03.215
Let me know if
you need anything.


1051
01:44:21.231 --> 01:44:22.341
Sure you don't want us with you?

1052
01:44:22.918 --> 01:44:25.049
Take care of that bastard, Taylor,
once and for all?


1053
01:44:25.079 --> 01:44:26.070
I'll be fine.

1054
01:44:26.898 --> 01:44:28.689
You heading into Forbes?
You bet.


1055
01:44:29.295 --> 01:44:31.752
I'm not leaving without a goodbye
present from a certain young lady


1056
01:44:32.355 --> 01:44:34.722
Or two.
Stay out of sight.


1057
01:44:36.128 --> 01:44:37.060
Don't draw any attention.

1058
01:44:38.520 --> 01:44:41.494
Be careful, Ben.
We'll be waiting for you at Mick's.


1059
01:44:46.800 --> 01:44:48.857
You're certain, this man
can be trusted, James?


1060
01:44:49.227 --> 01:44:52.452
Well, not 100%, 
Sir... but yes.

1061
01:44:53.074 --> 01:44:55.604
Sir, I dealt with these
informer types before.


1062
01:44:56.005 --> 01:44:58.240
Most often, they're planted
by the gang themselves.


1063
01:44:58.565 --> 01:45:01.687
Tryin' to throw us off the scent.
I believe this man is telling the truth.


1064
01:45:01.924 --> 01:45:04.247
I've known him some time, Sir.
Well, who is he?


1065
01:45:05.179 --> 01:45:06.999
He has asked to remain
completely anonymous, Sir.


1066
01:45:08.036 --> 01:45:08.835
I see.

1067
01:45:10.255 --> 01:45:12.208
Sergeant, would you
excuse us, please?


1068
01:45:15.781 --> 01:45:16.314
Sir!

1069
01:45:20.290 --> 01:45:22.420
I'm sorry, Sir, the fewer
people that know, the better.


1070
01:45:23.338 --> 01:45:24.876
Word spreads fast.

1071
01:45:25.788 --> 01:45:28.659
I want you to take out a patrol,
see where this leads...


1072
01:45:29.547 --> 01:45:33.527
If this fellow of yours is lying to us,
we'll soon know and have lost nothing.


1073
01:45:35.229 --> 01:45:39.254
But if he is telling the truth,
this may be our last chance, eh?


1074
01:45:39.505 --> 01:45:40.941
I'll assemble a party immediately.

1075
01:45:41.636 --> 01:45:43.663
I want Sgt. Condell
on this one, as well.


1076
01:45:44.891 --> 01:45:45.380
Sir.

1077
01:45:46.900 --> 01:45:50.668
You may find you need a man
like him on this, James, alright?


1078
01:45:51.792 --> 01:45:52.384
Very well.

1079
01:46:10.475 --> 01:46:10.895
Jim!

1080
01:46:15.757 --> 01:46:17.503
I'll keep him here.
Go! Go!


1081
01:46:25.656 --> 01:46:27.683
Henry, stay close to the house.

1082
01:46:47.018 --> 01:46:47.935
Come to see my boy.

1083
01:46:59.431 --> 01:47:00.112
Hello, Henry.

1084
01:47:00.985 --> 01:47:03.145
Hello.
Do you remember me?


1085
01:47:05.758 --> 01:47:08.259
You're Ben Hall, my Dah.

1086
01:47:10.893 --> 01:47:13.349
That's right, I have something here
that I wanted to give you.


1087
01:47:24.520 --> 01:47:27.554
It's you, not as hairy.

1088
01:47:28.353 --> 01:47:29.137
Thast's right...

1089
01:47:30.498 --> 01:47:31.238
I'm not as hairy.

1090
01:47:32.799 --> 01:47:33.761
I want you to have that,

1091
01:47:34.752 --> 01:47:36.335
so you always remember
who your Daddy is.


1092
01:47:43.883 --> 01:47:46.990
Where's Taylor? I have something
I have to discuss with him...


1093
01:47:48.303 --> 01:47:48.836
Both of you.

1094
01:47:53.348 --> 01:47:53.852
Alright.

1095
01:47:55.775 --> 01:47:57.329
Leave your guns here and
I'll take you to him.


1096
01:48:02.216 --> 01:48:02.734
Biddy!

1097
01:48:06.197 --> 01:48:06.680
Biddy, wait!
What are you...


1098
01:48:06.880 --> 01:48:08.431
He just wants to talk
to you and that's all.


1099
01:48:16.538 --> 01:48:17.707
This is all for Henry,

1100
01:48:19.734 --> 01:48:20.740
300 pounds.

1101
01:48:22.683 --> 01:48:23.956
I'm entrusting it
to his mother...


1102
01:48:25.036 --> 01:48:26.856
to be kept safe for
my son's future.


1103
01:48:27.048 --> 01:48:27.936
And nothing else.

1104
01:48:32.028 --> 01:48:36.126
Now, you'll swear an oath, never
to touch a single penny of it, ever.


1105
01:48:39.456 --> 01:48:41.009
I won't touch it, Ben.
I swear!


1106
01:48:47.664 --> 01:48:52.428
Because if you ever steal from
my son, I will hear of it...


1107
01:48:58.716 --> 01:49:00.062
You hold him to that oath, Biddy.

1108
01:49:25.065 --> 01:49:25.642
Where's Ben?

1109
01:49:26.056 --> 01:49:27.935
Went to say farewell to his boy,
out of Lake Hull


1110
01:49:29.096 --> 01:49:30.413
Won't be seeing him
for a few days yet.


1111
01:49:30.650 --> 01:49:31.745
He'll miss you, camped up that way,

1112
01:49:32.337 --> 01:49:35.252
off Mordicent,
wouldn't want anyone to see you here


1113
01:49:35.888 --> 01:49:36.273
Understood.

1114
01:49:40.195 --> 01:49:42.918
Thanks for the grub, Mr. Coneley.
You're welcome.


1115
01:49:50.495 --> 01:49:51.116
Everything alright?

1116
01:49:52.847 --> 01:49:54.460
While we're here,
keep your eyes wide open.


1117
01:50:06.578 --> 01:50:07.525
I have to go away...

1118
01:50:09.877 --> 01:50:11.209
I won't be able
to see you again.


1119
01:50:13.221 --> 01:50:16.136
Not for a very long time.
Promise me...


1120
01:50:17.764 --> 01:50:20.945
when you're grown up,
you'll come and find me.


1121
01:50:22.122 --> 01:50:23.203
I promise.

1122
01:50:27.079 --> 01:50:28.011
I'll be watching out for you.

1123
01:50:35.164 --> 01:50:38.656
You get as far away as you
can, Ben, as fast as you can.


1124
01:50:39.218 --> 01:50:41.334
You don't look back, you
get away safe, you hear?


1125
01:50:41.763 --> 01:50:42.340
Biddy...

1126
01:50:44.787 --> 01:50:47.924
I'm not proud of what I've become.
You have to believe that.


1127
01:50:50.647 --> 01:50:53.162
I just want Henry to know who
his father was before all this.


1128
01:50:56.077 --> 01:50:58.977
Only you can teach him that.
I will.


1129
01:51:00.634 --> 01:51:01.374
Thank you, Biddy.

1130
01:51:12.346 --> 01:51:13.604
I love you, little man.

1131
01:51:36.366 --> 01:51:38.319
Ben! Ben!

1132
01:51:49.330 --> 01:51:52.216
I'm so sorry for what I did.

1133
01:52:43.631 --> 01:52:45.940
Sergeant!
Inspector coming.


1134
01:52:54.661 --> 01:52:57.945
What's the situation?
They've arrived.


1135
01:52:58.744 --> 01:52:59.899
But Gilbert and Dunn only.

1136
01:53:00.283 --> 01:53:02.296
So, let's go take the little bastards.
No.


1137
01:53:02.713 --> 01:53:05.095
We'll wait for Ben Hall.
I mean to take all three.


1138
01:53:05.287 --> 01:53:07.921
If those 2 little bastards are there
now, I say we go get them now.


1139
01:53:07.951 --> 01:53:10.584
Hall will not be far behind.
Sir!


1140
01:53:10.614 --> 01:53:13.189
Do you hear me? We wait!

1141
01:53:36.711 --> 01:53:37.747
Cover the fire, quickly!

1142
01:53:47.409 --> 01:53:49.273
There!
Just who the hell are they?


1143
01:53:49.303 --> 01:53:52.218
I knew it! Conely sold us out,
the fuckin' fistgate!


1144
01:53:56.482 --> 01:53:57.873
What about Ben?
He's on his way here.


1145
01:53:57.917 --> 01:53:59.145
We'll find him first, come on.

1146
01:54:18.850 --> 01:54:19.442
Gilbert!

1147
01:54:23.209 --> 01:54:23.934
Johnny!

1148
01:54:27.131 --> 01:54:28.373
Gilbert!

1149
01:54:55.559 --> 01:54:58.400
Sergeant, is it true you know Ben Hall?
Hey,


1150
01:54:59.489 --> 01:55:01.768
I escorted him to
his trial in Orange in '62.


1151
01:55:02.508 --> 01:55:03.470
Twasn't long after...

1152
01:55:03.854 --> 01:55:06.281
him and Gardiner and his mates,
they put a little hole in my ribs...


1153
01:55:06.666 --> 01:55:09.655
at Ugaya Rocks.
Damned near killed me that day.


1154
01:55:10.521 --> 01:55:12.519
That Ben Hall fella
nearly killed me too.


1155
01:55:13.421 --> 01:55:15.449
One day at Leselly Creekside there,

1156
01:55:15.952 --> 01:55:17.091
him and other 3 fellas

1157
01:55:17.801 --> 01:55:20.183
they been chase me,
they been shooting at me


1158
01:55:20.851 --> 01:55:23.219
Me have to jump off my horse
up and run


1159
01:55:23.707 --> 01:55:25.616
but that Ben Hall fella
been chase after me


1160
01:55:26.341 --> 01:55:29.981
I had no bullet left; I grab my
gun and I threw it at him...


1161
01:55:31.873 --> 01:55:34.167
and him drop straight on
the ground on him head


1162
01:55:37.451 --> 01:55:40.307
Looks as though we're all acqainted
with the enemy, except myself.


1163
01:55:43.070 --> 01:55:45.615
You will be, sir, soon enough.

1164
01:56:15.094 --> 01:56:18.763
Ben, you're back.
Aye.


1165
01:56:19.903 --> 01:56:22.063
Any trouble about the place?
Not that I've seen.


1166
01:56:23.085 --> 01:56:23.588
All quiet.

1167
01:56:25.704 --> 01:56:27.909
Where are the others?
I've not seen 'em yet.


1168
01:56:28.811 --> 01:56:31.401
Strange, they should
have arrived days ago.


1169
01:56:32.352 --> 01:56:35.311
Hope they're alright,
Why don't you come inside?


1170
01:56:36.096 --> 01:56:37.516
I'll get Mary to cook up
a nice supper.


1171
01:56:38.078 --> 01:56:40.771
I think it's best I make camp.
Alright.


1172
01:56:55.007 --> 01:56:57.300
Gilbert and Dunn are gone.
Gone?


1173
01:56:57.774 --> 01:56:59.120
What do you mean?
Gone where?


1174
01:56:59.520 --> 01:57:01.236
Some Strickland stockmen
passed by yesterday, they


1175
01:57:01.266 --> 01:57:03.145
must have mistaken them
as policemen and bolted.


1176
01:57:03.320 --> 01:57:05.614
Dammit, we should have taken
them when we had the chance.


1177
01:57:05.644 --> 01:57:07.463
But Ben Hall's here.
What?


1178
01:57:07.730 --> 01:57:10.526
Just arrived, not an hour ago.
Camped half a mile from my place.


1179
01:57:11.680 --> 01:57:14.713
We take Hall immediately,
while we still can.


1180
01:57:15.311 --> 01:57:18.714
Davidson, if you ambush
Hall right there, in his camp,


1181
01:57:19.365 --> 01:57:22.325
you shoot him right there
and then, I'm tellin' you.


1182
01:57:22.798 --> 01:57:25.136
If he gets but a yard on you,
you'll lose him.


1183
01:57:25.490 --> 01:57:26.555
You can bet your life on it.

1184
01:57:28.627 --> 01:57:32.266
And then he'll know it was me.
He'll know!


1185
01:57:34.036 --> 01:57:34.687
Shoot him.

1186
01:58:06.700 --> 01:58:07.928
Still no sign of the boys?

1187
01:58:08.994 --> 01:58:10.385
Take a look around
first thing tomorrow.


1188
01:58:11.450 --> 01:58:12.160
Can't be far off.

1189
01:58:17.156 --> 01:58:18.222
See you in the morning, alright?

1190
01:58:23.129 --> 01:58:23.529
Mick,

1191
01:58:26.591 --> 01:58:26.991
Thank you.

1192
01:58:33.605 --> 01:58:36.165
There! Hall's in that bush somewhere.

1193
01:58:36.475 --> 01:58:37.511
Let's go get him now.

1194
01:58:38.014 --> 01:58:39.864
Not in daylight. He'll
see us coming a mile off.


1195
01:58:41.580 --> 01:58:43.814
Billy! Go ahead.

1196
01:58:44.782 --> 01:58:47.948
Find out exactly where Hall's?
Report straight back.


1197
01:58:48.120 --> 01:58:50.902
Quiet now! No noise, hm?
Good luck.


1198
01:58:53.649 --> 01:58:57.659
Now listen here, Billy. You get close
enough and you shoot that bastard.


1199
01:58:58.393 --> 01:58:59.207
You got that, Boyle?

1200
01:59:01.204 --> 01:59:02.122
You do as your ordered.

1201
01:59:02.486 --> 01:59:03.255
I do what he say.

1202
01:59:04.128 --> 01:59:05.401
What do you think you've
been given this for?


1203
01:59:05.933 --> 01:59:09.277
We're here to kill this man. If you
get the chance, then you shoot him.


1204
01:59:10.544 --> 01:59:11.580
Don't bloody miss.

1205
02:00:21.923 --> 02:00:23.399
Did you find him?
Yes, boss.


1206
02:00:24.272 --> 02:00:26.906
Ben Hall came over in
that trees there. Big bush.


1207
02:00:27.320 --> 02:00:28.075
Hard to be quiet.

1208
02:00:28.889 --> 02:00:31.478
We won't get within 40 yards\
without him hearing us.


1209
02:00:32.626 --> 02:00:35.571
I'm not underestimating this man,
Sergeant, not here!


1210
02:00:36.059 --> 02:00:39.358
This is his world. He knows the
bush like the blacks know the bush.


1211
02:00:40.498 --> 02:00:42.628
Quiet, lads, here's our play.

1212
02:00:43.271 --> 02:00:44.056
Keep this:

1213
02:00:44.411 --> 02:00:46.349
You take Buckley, Coburn,
Bourne and Charlie...


1214
02:00:46.719 --> 02:00:48.036
you circle right
round behind him


1215
02:00:48.391 --> 02:00:49.663
take a position on the lee side,

1216
02:00:49.826 --> 02:00:51.720
now you spread right out
across that flank


1217
02:00:51.750 --> 02:00:52.948
in case he makes a
break for that corner.


1218
02:00:53.584 --> 02:00:56.233
Now, you keep a good distance,
wait there til first light


1219
02:00:56.514 --> 02:00:59.710
Nobody makes a move on him,
fires a single shot,unless I do.


1220
02:01:01.056 --> 02:01:03.956
If we can take him alive, we will.
Let's move!


1221
02:01:05.461 --> 02:01:05.816
I'm up.

1222
02:01:07.340 --> 02:01:11.395
Wait! Boot off,
all of you.


1223
02:01:12.401 --> 02:01:14.191
Sir?
He'll hear us coming a mile off.


1224
02:01:14.848 --> 02:01:15.484
Boots off!

1225
02:01:36.014 --> 02:01:36.591
Ben Hall!

1226
02:04:29.834 --> 02:04:30.589
On my mark.

1227
02:05:10.622 --> 02:05:11.924
Hall!

1228
02:05:18.816 --> 02:05:21.110
Stand fast!

1229
02:05:24.483 --> 02:05:26.732
Hall!

1230
02:05:27.612 --> 02:05:28.485
Shoot him!

1231
02:05:30.083 --> 02:05:31.296
Shoot him now!

1232
02:05:33.161 --> 02:05:35.084
Stand fast!

1233
02:05:52.774 --> 02:05:53.455
Come on!

1234
02:06:39.875 --> 02:06:41.192
No!

1235
02:06:47.965 --> 02:06:50.110
Cease fire!

1236
02:07:15.095 --> 02:07:16.471
Halt!

1237
02:07:19.786 --> 02:07:23.411
No, no, I'm wounded.

1238
02:07:24.476 --> 02:07:25.319
I'm wounded.

1239
02:07:44.729 --> 02:07:45.839
Hold fire!

1240
02:07:46.756 --> 02:07:48.650
Hold fire! No!

1241
02:07:50.509 --> 02:07:54.593
Hold fire!
Cease Fire!


1242
02:10:23.204 --> 02:10:26.045
My God! What happened?
You couldn't take him alive?


1243
02:10:26.548 --> 02:10:27.126
No, Sir.

1244
02:10:28.868 --> 02:10:29.859
Never gave us the chance.

1245
02:10:32.532 --> 02:10:34.308
Well, he must have put
up one hell of a last fight.


1246
02:10:35.906 --> 02:10:37.282
He didn't fire a shot.
What?


1247
02:10:38.983 --> 02:10:42.209
He didn't fire a single shot, Sir.
He was on the run, though, Sir


1248
02:10:42.638 --> 02:10:45.109
And armed... had no choice

1249
02:10:46.796 --> 02:10:49.267
I want a full report from
both of you, immediately!

02:14:02.065 --> 02:14:12.065
