RESYNC BY BSpidey87

2
00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:40.470
Heads, you live.

3
00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:43.770
Tails, you die.

4
00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:49.670
Tails, you die.

5
00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:54.570
My name is Domino Harvey.

6
00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:56.870
I am a bounty hunter.

7
00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.270
What I say
over the next several hours


8
00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:04.670
will determine whether or not
I spend the rest of my life in prison.


9
00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.370
Tails, you die.

10
00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:10.970
Miss Harvey, my name is Taryn Mills.

11
00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:13.970
I'm a criminal psychologist
working for the FBI.


12
00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.270
I'm here to ask you
a few questions.


13
00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:18.370
Here's the part

14
00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:20.070
where I'm supposed
to get all defensive


15
00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:23.270
and say, "Not until
I speak with my attorney. "


16
00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:26.870
I'll tell you everything I know.

17
00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:31.370
36 hours ago,
$10 million was stolen


18
00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.470
from an armoured car that
was subsequently found


19
00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.370
abandoned at the Hoover Dam.

20
00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.670
The driver's name was Locus Fender.

21
00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.670
We know that he
was in on the heist.

22
00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:51.270
We know that
he was in on the heist.


23
00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:54.170
Is it true that you were hired

24
00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.270
to track down
and capture the thieves


25
00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:58.070
and then deliver them to Drake Bishop,

26
00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.370
owner of the Stratosphere
Hotel and Casino?


27
00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:02.570
Yes.

28
00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:05.070
You then learned

29
00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:07.070
where the thieves
had hidden the money.


30
00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.470
And at the instructions
of your employer,


31
00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:12.570
went to retrieve the money yourself.

32
00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.970
We were sent out
to the Fender Compound...


33
00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:18.670
in the desert near the chicken ranch.

34
00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:26.270
This way.

35
00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:44.270
All right, on my go.

36
00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:46.970
Watch your ass on this one.

37
00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:49.270
Go.

38
00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:08.670
Sic 'em, boy! Sic 'em!

39
00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:17.570
Fuck!

40
00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:20.570
Chi Chi?

41
00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:23.870
That's my best friend.

42
00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:26.970
His name is Choco.
He's always fancied me,


43
00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:29.670
but too shy to ever
do anything about it.


44
00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:32.770
Chi Chi!

45
00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:36.670
Edna, Chi Chi's in doggie hell.

46
00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:39.470
All we want is the money.

47
00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:40.770
That's Ed Moseby,

48
00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:43.770
the most legendary bounty hunter
in all of Los Angeles.


49
00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:46.270
He's my boss, my mentor,

50
00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:48.070
the father I never had.

51
00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:51.570
Chi Chi!

52
00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:56.170
My poor Chi Chi!

53
00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:02.370
The Manchurian Candidate,
eh, Edna?


54
00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:05.570
Is that you, Domino?

55
00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:07.570
Nice to see you, darling.

56
00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:10.370
Your father must be so proud

57
00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:13.970
of what's become of his little angel.

58
00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:15.770
Listen, bitch, we've got your son!

59
00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:18.470
If you don't give us the money,
we're gonna wax his fucking ass!


60
00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:20.370
You don’t have shit!

61
00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:22.470
Hey, Choco.

62
00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:26.470
Show her.

63
00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:41.070
He's still alive, Edna!

64
00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:43.070
Prove it!

65
00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:45.170
Choco, go get him.

66
00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:03.070
Last question for £20.

67
00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:05.370
Start the clock. 
Zack, in anatomy,

68
00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:07.970
a human being is usually
born with how many toes?


69
00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:09.870
We got to show Edna her son.

70
00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:19.270
That's our driver Alf.

71
00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:20.870
He's from Afghanistan.

72
00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:23.470
He once ate a cat.

73
00:05:25.670 --> 00:05:27.670
We can’t understand how to
pronounce his fucking name,


74
00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:30.370
so we just call him
the cat eating alien.


75
00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:40.270
What does that mean?

76
00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:42.170
Shut the fuck up.

77
00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:18.470
How did Locus Fender lose his arm?

78
00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:24.970
He had the combination
to the safe tattooed on it.


79
00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:26.770
Mama! Mama!

80
00:06:27.570 --> 00:06:29.070
Locus!

81
00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:30.370
Mama. Mama.

82
00:06:30.470 --> 00:06:32.170
Baby, I'm here!

83
00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:34.270
Please. Please.

84
00:06:35.570 --> 00:06:37.770
You got to do as I say.

85
00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:41.170
Now, the combination is on my arm.

86
00:06:42.670 --> 00:06:44.870
Mama, you got to get the decoder.

87
00:06:45.770 --> 00:06:47.470
Please, Mama.

88
00:06:48.270 --> 00:06:50.670
Put your weapon down!

89
00:06:51.870 --> 00:06:53.270
Put it down, Mama!

90
00:06:53.370 --> 00:06:54.970
Put your fucking weapon down!

91
00:07:17.670 --> 00:07:19.170
Time to start at the beginning.

92
00:07:20.470 --> 00:07:22.670
Time to start at the beginning.

93
00:07:23.370 --> 00:07:25.270
I'm the boss.

94
00:07:25.970 --> 00:07:29.270
I'm already a cool
motherfucker, you know?


95
00:07:29.370 --> 00:07:30.970
I employ bounty hunters.

96
00:07:30.970 --> 00:07:32.370
I'm here today to speak

97
00:07:32.470 --> 00:07:35.170
for all the women of
mixed race in America.


98
00:07:35.270 --> 00:07:36.570
I'm sorry?

99
00:07:37.770 --> 00:07:40.770
I will knock
you out! Number one!


100
00:07:44.670 --> 00:07:46.570
Where's my money?

101
00:07:48.370 --> 00:07:49.870
I fuckin' love that show.

102
00:08:25.770 --> 00:08:27.970
Maybe one of you will survive.

103
00:08:49.870 --> 00:08:51.470
Now, Mama!

104
00:08:53.370 --> 00:08:54.970
Put your fucking weapon down!

105
00:09:07.570 --> 00:09:10.570
You got 10 minutes
to open that safe, Edna.


106
00:09:11.370 --> 00:09:13.670
Fuck you!

107
00:09:15.370 --> 00:09:16.870
I've never killed anyone.

108
00:09:16.970 --> 00:09:21.270
I hope to never kill anyone,
even if they deserve it.


109
00:09:21.370 --> 00:09:25.670
My agenda is to kick ass
and secure the bounty.


110
00:09:25.670 --> 00:09:29.670
If I'm on this side of the law,
I can live the low life and avoid jail.


111
00:09:29.770 --> 00:09:33.570
I can live the nasty
and not do time for it.


112
00:09:33.870 --> 00:09:36.370
That's called
the best of both worlds.


113
00:09:36.470 --> 00:09:39.770
As for that other world,
that 90210 world,


114
00:09:39.870 --> 00:09:41.870
it's not for me.

115
00:09:48.770 --> 00:09:50.370
Is that him?

116
00:09:50.370 --> 00:09:52.370
Is that your dad?

117
00:09:52.470 --> 00:09:55.070
My real father was an actor.

118
00:09:55.170 --> 00:09:57.070
He died when I was a little girl.

119
00:09:57.170 --> 00:09:58.170
Hi, Ben.

120
00:09:58.270 --> 00:10:00.370
What the hell are you doing?
What's the matter with you?


121
00:10:00.470 --> 00:10:02.870
Heh. I knew Frank.

122
00:10:02.970 --> 00:10:04.670
Who didn't?

123
00:10:05.470 --> 00:10:07.370
Hey, Edna...

124
00:10:07.470 --> 00:10:09.470
You know what, sweetheart?
You got, like, 7 minutes


125
00:10:09.570 --> 00:10:11.870
to open that goddamn freezer,

126
00:10:11.970 --> 00:10:14.470
or I'm gonna flush that
fucking arm down the toilet.


127
00:10:14.570 --> 00:10:16.070
Fucker!

128
00:10:16.170 --> 00:10:18.170
You're probably
wondering how a girl like me


129
00:10:18.270 --> 00:10:20.770
arrived here, at the arse end
of the Nevada Desert


130
00:10:20.870 --> 00:10:24.570
with a blood-spattered Winnebago
and a one-armed man.


131
00:10:26.770 --> 00:10:30.470
The Department of
Motor Vehicles in Los Angeles.


132
00:10:31.870 --> 00:10:34.070
His name is Frances.

133
00:10:34.170 --> 00:10:36.970
Mr 90210 college boy
had found himself


134
00:10:37.070 --> 00:10:39.470
in the wrong place at the wrong time.

135
00:10:39.570 --> 00:10:41.370
Hey, yeah, what's up?

136
00:10:41.470 --> 00:10:42.570
OK.

137
00:10:42.670 --> 00:10:45.970
Look, I said,

138
00:10:46.070 --> 00:10:48.870
they're about to call
my number, like, any second.


139
00:10:48.970 --> 00:10:51.270
Now, are you in, or are you out?

140
00:10:51.370 --> 00:10:55.670
OK. Make up your fucking mind, 'cause
they're about to call my number.


141
00:10:55.770 --> 00:11:00.370
Right now, 'cause they're about to call
my fucking number.


142
00:11:01.270 --> 00:11:03.070
All right.

143
00:11:03.170 --> 00:11:04.870
We're on.

144
00:11:13.570 --> 00:11:17.670
Now serving GO86.

145
00:11:17.670 --> 00:11:19.970
Hey...

146
00:11:22.370 --> 00:11:24.170
Kee Kee?

147
00:11:33.370 --> 00:11:36.670
Kee Kee said that
you could deliver the...


148
00:11:36.770 --> 00:11:39.670
the IDs tonight.

149
00:11:40.370 --> 00:11:42.870
Lateesha... I need that web link.

150
00:11:42.970 --> 00:11:45.770
The J Lo concert is
probably sold out already.


151
00:11:50.370 --> 00:11:53.170
Kee Kee don’t make the rules.

152
00:11:53.970 --> 00:11:55.070
Listen...

153
00:11:56.170 --> 00:11:58.170
bitch...

154
00:12:01.870 --> 00:12:05.370
I don't think you understand who
the fuck you're dealing with here.


155
00:12:06.470 --> 00:12:10.870
OK? Because I could make
your job disappear like that.


156
00:12:14.370 --> 00:12:16.770
Kee Kee said tonight.

157
00:12:26.270 --> 00:12:28.470
Tonight, 8pm.

158
00:12:31.070 --> 00:12:32.970
Anything else?

159
00:12:35.470 --> 00:12:37.470
Nope.

160
00:12:37.570 --> 00:12:39.570
Good-bye, Frances.

161
00:12:41.970 --> 00:12:44.270
Good-bye, Lateesha.

162
00:12:54.270 --> 00:12:55.970
Fuck 'em.

163
00:12:57.670 --> 00:12:59.770
Fuck ‘em all.

164
00:13:01.170 --> 00:13:03.270
Lateesha, Frances,
and the 4 fake IDs


165
00:13:03.370 --> 00:13:05.970
is where it all went wrong.

166
00:13:06.270 --> 00:13:08.170
Where's the money?

167
00:13:08.270 --> 00:13:10.170
I don't know.

168
00:13:15.470 --> 00:13:18.970
I think that you're lying. I think you know
exactly where the money is.


169
00:13:21.370 --> 00:13:24.070
I think you're trying to scare me
into falsely incriminating myself,


170
00:13:24.170 --> 00:13:26.070
and it's not going to work.

171
00:13:27.370 --> 00:13:31.770
This is your last chance. Once I walk
out that door, I can't help you.


172
00:13:36.570 --> 00:13:40.670
When I was a little girl, my
father told me that if you weren't careful,


173
00:13:40.770 --> 00:13:45.170
you could lose everything you've ever
earned in life in a split second.


174
00:13:45.570 --> 00:13:48.370
You have to know when to cash out.

175
00:14:07.570 --> 00:14:09.670
Thank you.

176
00:14:13.770 --> 00:14:16.270
He will wipe away
every tear from their eyes,


177
00:14:16.370 --> 00:14:17.970
and death will be no more.

178
00:14:18.070 --> 00:14:20.070
Neither will mourning nor outcry

179
00:14:20.170 --> 00:14:22.470
nor pain be any more.

180
00:14:22.870 --> 00:14:25.870
The former things have passed away.

181
00:14:27.170 --> 00:14:28.670
And, look...

182
00:14:28.770 --> 00:14:30.670
I am with you all the days

183
00:14:30.670 --> 00:14:33.870
until the conclusion
of the system of things.


184
00:14:44.970 --> 00:14:48.370
After Dad passed on, my
mum's agenda was to hit the town


185
00:14:48.470 --> 00:14:51.170
and find another husband
with a boatload of cash.


186
00:14:54.970 --> 00:14:57.070
Hello, Mr Stevens. How are you?

187
00:14:57.170 --> 00:15:00.170
- Good holidays?
- Absolutely. Thank you.


188
00:15:00.270 --> 00:15:03.470
Darling.
I love you, love you.


189
00:15:03.570 --> 00:15:06.570
- Bye. Got to go, got to go.
- Bye.


190
00:15:10.770 --> 00:15:13.270
She decided to sock me
and my goldfish Sammy away


191
00:15:13.370 --> 00:15:14.970
in boarding school.

192
00:15:19.970 --> 00:15:22.970
A week later, sammy died.

193
00:15:24.470 --> 00:15:27.070
It was a pivotal moment in my life.

194
00:15:27.170 --> 00:15:31.370
I decided to never invest too much
emotion in one thing.


195
00:15:34.770 --> 00:15:38.070
It's always a set-up
to the pain of losing them.


196
00:16:01.470 --> 00:16:03.470
God created me
in His image.


197
00:16:13.670 --> 00:16:16.170
I guess
he had a thing for models.


198
00:16:16.270 --> 00:16:18.270
I guess
he had a thing for models.


199
00:16:18.370 --> 00:16:21.570
Like most models,
I was bored with life.


200
00:16:21.670 --> 00:16:24.870
I hated everything and everyone.

201
00:16:30.370 --> 00:16:33.070
If you think America
is dirt bag central,


202
00:16:33.170 --> 00:16:36.870
clearly you've never been to the sleaze
nation of our Queen Mother.


203
00:16:41.570 --> 00:16:43.570
I hope all this
is not gonna change you.


204
00:16:43.570 --> 00:16:47.070
One thing we'd like to change, though...
You said Ian's name wrong.


205
00:16:47.170 --> 00:16:50.370
- Right, it's "eye-an".
- Ian Ziering, not "ee-an" Ziering.


206
00:16:50.470 --> 00:16:52.370
It's "eye-an", since birth.

207
00:16:52.470 --> 00:16:55.670
Brilliant... Absolutely brilliant.

208
00:16:56.170 --> 00:16:59.070
Mum was determined
to move us to Beverly Hills.


209
00:16:59.170 --> 00:17:01.370
That damn show started it all.

210
00:17:01.370 --> 00:17:03.870
That damn show
started it all.


211
00:17:07.370 --> 00:17:10.970
She remarried to a man
named Mark Waldman.


212
00:17:12.270 --> 00:17:15.370
He invested in a restaurant
called the Hard Rock Cafe.


213
00:17:17.270 --> 00:17:20.970
Domino, Domino, give the goddamn
num chucks a rest already.


214
00:17:21.070 --> 00:17:23.070
It's time for supper. 
Come on, baby.

215
00:17:23.170 --> 00:17:25.770
I tried
Beverly Hills High for a spell,


216
00:17:25.870 --> 00:17:27.770
but it didn't work out.

217
00:17:27.870 --> 00:17:31.070
I hated them. I hated them all.

218
00:17:31.170 --> 00:17:34.470
5, 6, 7, 8!
We are Alpha Omega


219
00:17:34.570 --> 00:17:36.570
we are the AOPs...

220
00:17:36.670 --> 00:17:40.370
College was even worse.
Mum convinced me to join a sorority.


221
00:17:40.370 --> 00:17:42.670
It was all fun and games at first.

222
00:17:42.770 --> 00:17:44.570
Then the hazing started.

223
00:17:51.470 --> 00:17:54.670
This is fucking disgusting!

224
00:17:54.770 --> 00:17:57.670
Disgusting!

225
00:18:02.870 --> 00:18:05.970
Look at these mosquito bites.

226
00:18:08.470 --> 00:18:11.770
What's it like to have the body
of a 10-year-old boy?


227
00:18:15.570 --> 00:18:18.370
- Have you had a nose job?
- No.


228
00:18:28.570 --> 00:18:31.470
A week later, I was expelled.

229
00:18:32.170 --> 00:18:35.470
In the end,
it all came down to fate...


230
00:18:36.870 --> 00:18:40.770
An LA Weekly advert
strewn across the ground.


231
00:18:44.770 --> 00:18:47.370
Claremont Williams III...

232
00:18:47.470 --> 00:18:51.070
- Yeah!
- The legendary bail bondsman.


233
00:19:15.370 --> 00:19:18.570
I'm here for
the bounty hunter seminar.


234
00:19:24.670 --> 00:19:26.670
Cash?

235
00:19:31.870 --> 00:19:34.070
Keep the change.

236
00:19:42.570 --> 00:19:44.170
See, as a bail bondsman,

237
00:19:44.170 --> 00:19:47.470
I'm the go-between for
the court and the accused.


238
00:19:47.570 --> 00:19:49.370
For a 10% fee,

239
00:19:49.470 --> 00:19:52.270
I will guarantee the amount
set by the court.


240
00:19:52.370 --> 00:19:53.770
Now...

241
00:19:53.870 --> 00:19:56.570
if the defendant should fail to appear

242
00:19:56.670 --> 00:19:58.570
at his or her court date,

243
00:19:58.670 --> 00:20:03.070
I will bring in a bounty hunter
to recapture the defendant,


244
00:20:03.170 --> 00:20:06.870
or I will face having to repay
the court costs myself,


245
00:20:06.970 --> 00:20:11.070
which... we can't do.

246
00:20:13.070 --> 00:20:16.170
Now, this occurs most...

247
00:20:19.670 --> 00:20:22.370
frequently when the collateral

248
00:20:22.470 --> 00:20:25.470
or the guarantee
given to the bondsman


249
00:20:25.470 --> 00:20:30.770
turns out to be worthless
or difficult to liquidate.


250
00:20:31.470 --> 00:20:34.970
So... in layman's terms,

251
00:20:35.070 --> 00:20:38.770
we get 10% of the bail.

252
00:20:38.870 --> 00:20:41.870
Now, in the next few moments,

253
00:20:41.970 --> 00:20:45.270
Ed Moseby will take the podium,
and he will begin the seminar


254
00:20:45.370 --> 00:20:47.370
on how to become a bounty hunter.

255
00:20:47.470 --> 00:20:50.670
In the meantime, feel free to take
a coffee break, pee break, whatever.


256
00:20:50.770 --> 00:20:53.470
We'll be starting
in the next few minutes.


257
00:20:55.870 --> 00:21:00.370
Hey, how about it? Want to ride
some bounty hunter cock?


258
00:21:00.470 --> 00:21:04.070
- Fuck you, dickhead.
- Bitch!


259
00:21:04.170 --> 00:21:06.970
Excuse the fuck out of us!

260
00:21:15.270 --> 00:21:17.370
We got to ditch this thing.

261
00:21:18.970 --> 00:21:20.970
Gentlemen...

262
00:21:21.070 --> 00:21:23.470
it has been a pleasure.

263
00:21:24.870 --> 00:21:28.570
All right, bathroom window, 5minutes.

264
00:21:28.670 --> 00:21:30.870
I'll keep the engine running.

265
00:21:40.470 --> 00:21:42.870
Nobody really knows
where Ed came from.


266
00:21:42.970 --> 00:21:45.770
This much is clear...
the man's been places,


267
00:21:45.770 --> 00:21:48.670
seen things, lived life.

268
00:21:48.770 --> 00:21:51.270
He did a term in Soledad
and a term in Angola,


269
00:21:51.370 --> 00:21:54.370
where he lost a
toe during a prison riot.

270
00:21:54.470 --> 00:21:56.970
The man's a warrior.

271
00:22:15.970 --> 00:22:18.370
To say that Choco is
the product of a broken home


272
00:22:18.470 --> 00:22:21.070
is to presume a home existed
in the first place.


273
00:22:21.170 --> 00:22:25.170
No. Choco never had a home.
Well, not unless you count


274
00:22:25.270 --> 00:22:27.070
10 or so juvenile
correction facilities,


275
00:22:27.170 --> 00:22:29.170
where he spent his childhood.

276
00:22:36.370 --> 00:22:38.370
Mierda! Damn!

277
00:22:41.870 --> 00:22:43.670
Goddamn!

278
00:22:45.070 --> 00:22:47.270
Puta...

279
00:22:47.370 --> 00:22:50.570
- What the fuck is this?
- Where the fuck are you going?


280
00:22:50.670 --> 00:22:53.170
Those people paid for a seminar!

281
00:22:54.870 --> 00:22:56.670
Where do you get off
fucking up my windshield?


282
00:22:56.670 --> 00:22:59.470
I want a job!

283
00:23:02.570 --> 00:23:04.970
Jesus fuckin' Christ, lady.

284
00:23:04.970 --> 00:23:07.570
Everybody wants a goddamn job.

285
00:23:08.470 --> 00:23:11.770
What makes you think you
can do this one?


286
00:23:15.070 --> 00:23:17.570
I've been training since I was 12.

287
00:23:17.670 --> 00:23:19.970
Knives, guns, throwing stars.

288
00:23:20.070 --> 00:23:23.570
You name it, I can fight with it.
I'm a hard worker. I'm a hard worker.


289
00:23:23.670 --> 00:23:28.170
I'm fast to learn, and nothing scares me.
I'm not afraid to die.


290
00:23:33.470 --> 00:23:35.570
Why would a...

291
00:23:35.670 --> 00:23:40.170
delicate little thing like you
want to be a goddamn bounty hunter?


292
00:23:41.270 --> 00:23:43.970
I want to have a little fun.

293
00:23:47.570 --> 00:23:49.870
You want to have a little fun?

294
00:23:53.470 --> 00:23:56.170
Well, little girl, you want a job?

295
00:23:56.270 --> 00:23:58.070
Yeah.

296
00:23:58.970 --> 00:24:00.770
It's gonna cost you a new windshield.

297
00:24:00.870 --> 00:24:04.370
You know what? Enough of that
"little girl" shit. The name is Domino.


298
00:24:05.270 --> 00:24:07.170
Domino.

299
00:24:07.770 --> 00:24:11.170
- Domino what?
- No, just Domino.


300
00:24:11.270 --> 00:24:13.470
Let's take a ride.

301
00:24:13.570 --> 00:24:14.570
Qué?

302
00:24:28.070 --> 00:24:31.470
The kid's name is Hector Maldonado,

303
00:24:31.970 --> 00:24:36.570
His mother posted bail for him,
after he was arrested for a drive-by.


304
00:24:40.170 --> 00:24:43.170
He speaks perfect fuckin' English.
He just thinks it's cute


305
00:24:43.270 --> 00:24:45.770
when he's around
a good-looking woman.


306
00:24:55.670 --> 00:24:58.070
Hey. Yeah, listen.

307
00:24:58.170 --> 00:25:01.870
Louise, listen,
you can make this easy,


308
00:25:01.970 --> 00:25:04.370
or you can make it real complicated.

309
00:25:05.470 --> 00:25:08.270
For $200, Louise gave us
her boyfriend's whereabouts


310
00:25:08.370 --> 00:25:11.870
at the local gang banger hangout
across the street.


311
00:25:22.670 --> 00:25:25.070
What's his problem?

312
00:25:25.170 --> 00:25:29.170
Latin petulance. Hold on.
Give me a minute with him.


313
00:25:29.970 --> 00:25:33.570
All right, come on,
princess, spit it out.


314
00:25:35.770 --> 00:25:38.970
Why do we need that bitch on the
team? You don’t like what I'm doing?


315
00:25:39.070 --> 00:25:42.170
I can hear you.

316
00:25:42.270 --> 00:25:45.870
Hey, baby, why don’t you take a walk
and let me handle this?


317
00:25:46.270 --> 00:25:49.870
First, she ain't on the team yet.

318
00:25:49.970 --> 00:25:51.670
OK?

319
00:25:51.770 --> 00:25:54.270
Second of all,

320
00:25:54.370 --> 00:25:56.370
take a look at her.

321
00:25:56.570 --> 00:25:59.270
I mean, come on, man, she ain't ugly.

322
00:25:59.870 --> 00:26:02.070
You and I walk down the street,
what do people see?


323
00:26:02.170 --> 00:26:04.070
A couple of losers, right?

324
00:26:04.170 --> 00:26:07.970
We add her to the equation, you know
what people are gonna think?


325
00:26:08.070 --> 00:26:08.970
What?

326
00:26:09.070 --> 00:26:13.670
There goes two of the coolest
mother fuckers who ever lived.


327
00:26:15.770 --> 00:26:19.070
You know what?
I don't know about you, man, but...


328
00:26:19.170 --> 00:26:22.270
I'm already
a cool motherfucker, you know?


329
00:26:22.370 --> 00:26:25.070
Sometimes you got
your own tongue up your ass.


330
00:26:25.170 --> 00:26:27.970
Little fuckin' pendejo.

331
00:26:29.470 --> 00:26:33.570
I could feel the blood
coursing through my veins.


332
00:26:35.270 --> 00:26:38.470
Merry Christmas.
Did you ever use one of these?


333
00:26:38.570 --> 00:26:41.570
Ever heard of the
Beverly Hills Gun Club?


334
00:26:44.970 --> 00:26:47.870
Shotgun in hand,
kicking down a door and wondering


335
00:26:47.970 --> 00:26:50.170
if there was heavy firepower
on the other side.


336
00:26:50.170 --> 00:26:52.570
Domino, you cover the side.

337
00:26:52.670 --> 00:26:54.970
Choco, you cover the rear.

338
00:26:55.070 --> 00:26:57.470
On my word.

339
00:26:58.370 --> 00:27:00.170
Turns out...

340
00:27:00.270 --> 00:27:03.270
my first raid was to be
a near-disaster.


341
00:27:06.370 --> 00:27:08.770
That bitch Louise set us up.

342
00:27:08.870 --> 00:27:10.970
Hector was hiding underneath
her bed all along.


343
00:27:11.070 --> 00:27:14.770
- Hey, what's up, fool?
- Hurry! There's 3 po-pos out front!


344
00:27:14.870 --> 00:27:17.070
Fuck. You serious?

345
00:27:23.470 --> 00:27:25.870
Ed On my go.

346
00:27:28.270 --> 00:27:29.870
Go.

347
00:27:44.970 --> 00:27:49.270
That night, my coin was tossed.

348
00:27:50.170 --> 00:27:52.970
Heads, you live. 
Tails, you die.

349
00:27:58.770 --> 00:28:00.870
50/50 chance.

350
00:28:01.470 --> 00:28:03.170
Life or death.

351
00:28:12.370 --> 00:28:14.470
This ain't Sunset Boulevard.

352
00:28:16.670 --> 00:28:19.570
My destiny was life.

353
00:28:27.870 --> 00:28:30.570
Life as a bounty hunter.

354
00:28:34.370 --> 00:28:36.670
Put that shit down, homey!

355
00:28:36.770 --> 00:28:40.170
What the fuck you doin', bitch?!
Step back, motherfucker!


356
00:28:49.170 --> 00:28:50.870
What the fuck you want?

357
00:28:50.970 --> 00:28:54.070
We're not cops. We're bounty hunters.
All we want is Hector.


358
00:28:54.170 --> 00:28:56.470
Fuck you and the fuckin' po-pos, bitch!

359
00:28:56.570 --> 00:28:58.970
You tell me where he is,
and I'll give you...


360
00:28:59.070 --> 00:29:00.270
You'll what?

361
00:29:00.270 --> 00:29:05.070
Sometimes a girl has to be
naughty to get herself out of a jam.


362
00:29:05.070 --> 00:29:07.070
I'll give you a lap dance.

363
00:29:07.070 --> 00:29:08.970
Man, fuck you, bitch!

364
00:29:09.070 --> 00:29:11.870
I'll give you a lap dance,
bra and panties on.


365
00:29:11.870 --> 00:29:15.270
Man, if I wanted all that,
I'd go to a strip joint, motherfucker.


366
00:29:15.370 --> 00:29:17.770
Come on, you and me.

367
00:29:19.070 --> 00:29:20.970
You know you want it.

368
00:29:21.970 --> 00:29:24.270
Hey, what do you think, dawg?

369
00:29:24.370 --> 00:29:26.470
I want to see what the fuck
this bitch is workin' with.


370
00:29:26.470 --> 00:29:29.970
- I'm offering it to you, baby. Come on.
- Is that right?


371
00:29:30.770 --> 00:29:33.270
Well, take off your clothes, bitch.

372
00:29:36.070 --> 00:29:38.370
Sit down.

373
00:29:40.470 --> 00:29:42.370
That's right, girl.
That's right, girl.


374
00:30:05.870 --> 00:30:07.670
It worked.

375
00:30:07.870 --> 00:30:10.870
We got the scoop
on how to find Hector.


376
00:30:10.970 --> 00:30:13.070
2 weeks later, we nailed him.

377
00:30:17.970 --> 00:30:20.370
Claremont was Charlie
to our three Angels.


378
00:30:20.470 --> 00:30:24.970
It's very simple. The...
DMV is the de facto conduit


379
00:30:25.070 --> 00:30:26.870
for all humanity,

380
00:30:26.970 --> 00:30:28.870
and every human being
that we track down


381
00:30:28.970 --> 00:30:31.870
has a record in the DMV database.

382
00:30:31.970 --> 00:30:35.470
Whether it be LAPD,
Social Services,


383
00:30:35.570 --> 00:30:37.370
the Credit Bureau, or the FBI,

384
00:30:37.470 --> 00:30:39.970
they all use the DMV's database
as their hub.


385
00:30:40.070 --> 00:30:43.270
So, we have people on the inside
who feed us the information.


386
00:30:43.370 --> 00:30:45.170
This one right there.

387
00:30:45.470 --> 00:30:48.470
Shit. And who would know it?

388
00:30:48.570 --> 00:30:53.770
The gatekeepers of humanity turn out
to be a bunch of sassy black women.


389
00:31:00.470 --> 00:31:02.470
Excuse me?

390
00:31:02.570 --> 00:31:04.770
He said he liked your suit.

391
00:31:06.470 --> 00:31:08.970
- Tell him what you said.
- I like your suit.


392
00:31:20.370 --> 00:31:24.070
After 6 months,
Claremont hired Alf to drive us around.


393
00:31:24.170 --> 00:31:26.670
We were so busy.

394
00:31:29.970 --> 00:31:35.270
Little did I know that the FBI liked
to keep tabs on us bounty hunters.


395
00:31:37.870 --> 00:31:41.470
Ed, what did you do
before you were a bounty hunter?


396
00:31:41.570 --> 00:31:45.070
I played music. 
I was a musician.

397
00:31:45.170 --> 00:31:46.570
Really?

398
00:31:46.670 --> 00:31:48.570
What, in a band?

399
00:31:49.670 --> 00:31:51.570
Did you ever hear
of Stevie Ray Vaughan?


400
00:31:51.670 --> 00:31:53.870
Wait, you're shitting me.

401
00:31:54.670 --> 00:31:57.570
Stevie and I hooked up in Austin.

402
00:31:58.670 --> 00:32:02.170
Back in the day,
we did the bus tour thing together.


403
00:32:02.770 --> 00:32:06.170
Played every goddamn
small club that would have us.


404
00:32:08.370 --> 00:32:11.970
Yep. Me and that
boy, we tore it up.

405
00:32:14.370 --> 00:32:16.070
Holy shit.

406
00:32:16.170 --> 00:32:19.570
Played with Pat Benatar,
but that was only when I needed cash.


407
00:32:19.670 --> 00:32:22.770
Fuck off. I love Pat Benatar.

408
00:32:22.870 --> 00:32:25.070
Hey... So did I.

409
00:32:26.170 --> 00:32:28.670
But that's another story.

410
00:32:29.870 --> 00:32:32.270
Love is a battlefield, baby.

411
00:32:36.470 --> 00:32:39.670
What about Choco?
How did you meet him?


412
00:32:43.270 --> 00:32:46.070
I met Choco on the street...

413
00:32:46.170 --> 00:32:49.270
a few hours after
he got out of lockup.

414
00:32:49.270 --> 00:32:53.170
He was standing there
in a pair of those jailhouse slippers.


415
00:32:54.070 --> 00:32:57.870
He didn't have a nickel in his pocket
or a place to sleep.


416
00:32:57.970 --> 00:33:00.170
We started talking, and I liked the kid.

417
00:33:00.270 --> 00:33:02.670
Like a little brother.

418
00:33:03.670 --> 00:33:05.470
You know?

419
00:33:05.570 --> 00:33:08.370
Worst thing in the world
is to be caged up.


420
00:33:08.370 --> 00:33:12.770
That boy has been there,
and he ain't never goin' back.


421
00:33:12.870 --> 00:33:15.870
Even if it costs him his life.

422
00:33:22.770 --> 00:33:25.970
-   What you lookin' at, darlin'?
- Nothing!


423
00:33:26.070 --> 00:33:27.770
Put that fucking gun down!

424
00:33:29.670 --> 00:33:31.570
Put the fucking gun down!

425
00:33:43.070 --> 00:33:46.070
Choco grew up
on the streets of Venezuela.


426
00:33:46.170 --> 00:33:47.270
When he was four years old,

427
00:33:47.370 --> 00:33:50.070
he stabbed another kid in the eyeball
with a pencil.


428
00:33:52.170 --> 00:33:54.870
There were wires crossed
somewhere in his soul.


429
00:34:19.070 --> 00:34:23.370
In 2003,
I was named Bounty Hunter of the Year.


430
00:34:31.670 --> 00:34:35.670
To the woman who has brought
beauty and grace


431
00:34:35.770 --> 00:34:37.770
to this profession...

432
00:34:37.870 --> 00:34:40.570
Domino Harve-e-e-ey!

433
00:35:01.470 --> 00:35:04.970
From that day on, Eddie,
Choco, and I were inseparable.


434
00:35:09.270 --> 00:35:11.670
It turned out
the three sassy black women and Raul


435
00:35:11.770 --> 00:35:16.470
were the gatekeepers of humanity...
the DMV.


436
00:35:16.470 --> 00:35:19.170
Lateesha was one of
Claremont's many mistresses.


437
00:35:19.270 --> 00:35:21.870
Claremont was godfather to us all.

438
00:35:22.070 --> 00:35:25.270
Just look at t that luscious action
right there. Look at that.


439
00:35:25.270 --> 00:35:28.170
Man, I'm gonna get you
a pair of glasses.


440
00:35:32.770 --> 00:35:34.470
Hey.

441
00:35:34.570 --> 00:35:36.670
That's an ass.

442
00:36:10.870 --> 00:36:14.170
Weather's gonna be
a great day today. Lots of sunshine.


443
00:36:14.270 --> 00:36:16.870
Cool temperatures, though.
We should be at 76 degrees.


444
00:36:16.970 --> 00:36:20.870
You know, a guy could get used
to a life this ordinary.


445
00:36:29.170 --> 00:36:31.370
Maybe you should...

446
00:36:32.170 --> 00:36:34.970
Maybe you should fuck her mom, too.

447
00:36:35.870 --> 00:36:39.270
What the fuck is your problem, bitch?

448
00:36:40.070 --> 00:36:41.570
So, who is this Choico?

449
00:36:42.170 --> 00:36:43.670
Mum was terrified for me.

450
00:36:43.770 --> 00:36:45.670
She didn't approve
of my lifestyle one bit.


451
00:36:45.770 --> 00:36:47.870
Is he your new boyfriend?

452
00:36:51.170 --> 00:36:54.370
His name is Choco, and he's not
my boyfriend. He's a bounty hunter.


453
00:36:54.470 --> 00:36:57.570
Whatever. He's a criminal.
And that Ed Moseby character...


454
00:36:57.670 --> 00:37:00.070
I mean, he's a complete loser.

455
00:37:02.870 --> 00:37:05.970
He knew Frank Sinatra.

456
00:37:09.470 --> 00:37:11.370
Who didn't?

457
00:37:16.470 --> 00:37:20.970
We may have been
dysfunctional, but we worked.


458
00:37:21.070 --> 00:37:22.770
We were family.

459
00:37:29.270 --> 00:37:30.770
Do you know this man?

460
00:37:30.870 --> 00:37:33.970
Yeah, he's a reality television producer.

461
00:37:34.070 --> 00:37:36.770
His name's Mark Heiss.

462
00:37:37.670 --> 00:37:42.570
Mr Heiss was very generous in turning
over some videotapes to the FBI.


463
00:37:42.670 --> 00:37:45.170
There's lots of footage of you.

464
00:37:46.270 --> 00:37:48.970
We know everything.

465
00:37:49.370 --> 00:37:50.570
Mark Heiss
was friends with Mum.


466
00:37:50.670 --> 00:37:52.970
I hate this!

467
00:37:53.070 --> 00:37:54.370
They changed the fucking font!

468
00:37:54.470 --> 00:37:56.970
He heard my story
at some cocktail party.


469
00:37:57.070 --> 00:38:00.070
She's stupid! You're not stupid.

470
00:38:00.170 --> 00:38:01.970
- All right.
- Get Cynthia on the line!


471
00:38:02.070 --> 00:38:05.270
- Well, Domino's in the lobby.
- They changed the fucking font!


472
00:38:05.370 --> 00:38:07.470
Well, Domino's been waiting.

473
00:38:07.570 --> 00:38:09.170
Put her in the conference room.

474
00:38:09.270 --> 00:38:11.270
Turns out, he wanted
to put us on television.


475
00:38:12.770 --> 00:38:16.070
I should let you know that
Mr Heiss will only be available to meet


476
00:38:16.170 --> 00:38:19.470
for about five minutes, so we should
hurry up and cut to the point.


477
00:38:21.170 --> 00:38:25.570
And speak in short sentences
because he has the attention span


478
00:38:25.670 --> 00:38:27.370
of a ferret on crystal meth.

479
00:38:27.970 --> 00:38:30.970
Mum was horrified
and demanded to tag along


480
00:38:30.970 --> 00:38:33.470
just to keep me from signing anything.

481
00:38:34.270 --> 00:38:37.470
- I've seen that.
- Excuse me?


482
00:38:37.570 --> 00:38:39.270
A ferret on crystal meth.

483
00:38:46.570 --> 00:38:49.070
You don’t speak...
you don't speak Spanish?


484
00:38:49.070 --> 00:38:51.070
- No.
- No?


485
00:38:52.370 --> 00:38:55.970
This is LA, man.
You should speak Spanish, you know?


486
00:38:58.470 --> 00:39:01.070
OK, everybody has water...

487
00:39:06.770 --> 00:39:11.070
God, he should be here
any second. Here he is.


488
00:39:12.270 --> 00:39:14.970
- Sophie.
- Hello.


489
00:39:15.570 --> 00:39:19.370
Sorry, guys, about the wait.
I'm having font issues.


490
00:39:19.470 --> 00:39:22.470
Let me cut to the chase
'cause I have to take this call.


491
00:39:22.570 --> 00:39:25.670
We want to follow you around
with a camera crew for a week.


492
00:39:25.770 --> 00:39:29.570
The last thing we did...
the pilot episode... is not testing well.


493
00:39:29.670 --> 00:39:31.570
We got too many rednecks.

494
00:39:37.870 --> 00:39:39.870
It's too much like Cops.

495
00:39:39.970 --> 00:39:41.670
We need... Go ahead.

496
00:39:42.470 --> 00:39:44.070
We need...

497
00:39:44.470 --> 00:39:46.670
something sexy!

498
00:39:47.370 --> 00:39:49.470
Something different.

499
00:39:51.470 --> 00:39:53.470
We need Domino.

500
00:39:57.070 --> 00:39:58.870
We need Domino.

501
00:40:01.270 --> 00:40:03.370
Listen, friend...

502
00:40:04.370 --> 00:40:06.370
we ain't gonna do this thing

503
00:40:06.470 --> 00:40:09.470
unless the whole team
gets equal coverage.


504
00:40:09.970 --> 00:40:13.370
You're not her father, Ed.
No one cares what you think.


505
00:40:18.870 --> 00:40:21.670
Well, with all due respect, Mom,

506
00:40:21.770 --> 00:40:26.370
I'm her boss,
and she's on my team. OK?


507
00:40:29.170 --> 00:40:31.570
And unless we all get equal coverage,

508
00:40:31.670 --> 00:40:34.870
we're all gonna walk the fuck
out of here together?


509
00:40:40.170 --> 00:40:43.770
Equal coverage, or we all walk.

510
00:40:43.870 --> 00:40:45.770
Done! OK.

511
00:40:46.470 --> 00:40:48.770
The whole team... We follow it.

512
00:40:48.870 --> 00:40:52.770
What guarantee can you give us that
Domino's name won’t be tarnished?


513
00:40:52.870 --> 00:40:55.770
Sophie, this is reality television.

514
00:40:55.870 --> 00:40:59.470
What you see is what you get.

515
00:40:59.570 --> 00:41:03.970
You will be exploited,
your story won’t be told truthfully,


516
00:41:04.070 --> 00:41:06.470
and your life will never be the same.

517
00:41:06.570 --> 00:41:09.270
I beg you.

518
00:41:09.370 --> 00:41:12.570
I beg you not
to get involved with this...

519
00:41:12.670 --> 00:41:14.670
this drivel!

520
00:41:15.770 --> 00:41:18.470
No offence, Mark,
but we both know that this is drivel.


521
00:41:18.570 --> 00:41:20.770
No offence taken.

522
00:41:20.870 --> 00:41:23.570
Anyway, if she's gonna be in anything,
she should be in the centre.


523
00:41:23.670 --> 00:41:25.970
Sure, OK.

524
00:41:26.070 --> 00:41:28.270
But...

525
00:41:28.370 --> 00:41:30.370
Done!

526
00:41:30.470 --> 00:41:33.270
Talk it over. I
have to take this call.

527
00:41:33.370 --> 00:41:36.970
Cynthia, you changed the fucking font
on the promo! Why?


528
00:41:37.070 --> 00:41:41.070
I felt like a hypocrite,
given my hatred of all things Hollywood,


529
00:41:41.170 --> 00:41:43.470
but I'll admit...

530
00:41:43.570 --> 00:41:45.470
I wanted my story told.

531
00:41:46.370 --> 00:41:49.270
I wanted everyone to know
the things I'd done.


532
00:41:49.370 --> 00:41:51.970
I wanted some recognition
in the world.


533
00:41:54.470 --> 00:41:55.970
We'll do it.

534
00:41:58.070 --> 00:42:00.270
We'll do it.

535
00:42:01.470 --> 00:42:04.570
God help us. God help us all.

536
00:42:04.670 --> 00:42:07.770
It was the beginning of the end.

537
00:42:09.370 --> 00:42:11.670
Jerry! Jerry!

538
00:42:11.770 --> 00:42:16.370
Welcome back. We're here in LA
with mixed race single mothers.


539
00:42:16.470 --> 00:42:18.870
Our next guest
takes pride in the fact


540
00:42:18.970 --> 00:42:21.170
that she's in the Guinness
Book of World Records


541
00:42:21.270 --> 00:42:25.070
for being America's
youngest grandmother.


542
00:42:25.170 --> 00:42:28.670
And... she's only 28.

543
00:42:28.770 --> 00:42:30.970
Please welcome Lateesha Rodriguez!

544
00:42:31.070 --> 00:42:33.870
Lateesha was
our prime contact at the DMV.


545
00:42:33.970 --> 00:42:37.570
Most of our bond certificates
came from Claremont through her.


546
00:42:41.170 --> 00:42:43.170
- Hey, Jerry!
- Hey, Lateesha. How are you?


547
00:42:43.270 --> 00:42:44.970
- I'm fine.
- What's going on?


548
00:42:45.070 --> 00:42:48.370
I'm here today to speak
for all people of mixed race in America.


549
00:42:48.470 --> 00:42:52.270
Now, as a blactino woman, I believe
we deserve our own race category


550
00:42:52.370 --> 00:42:55.170
to forge an identity, Jerry.
That's how I feel.


551
00:42:55.270 --> 00:42:57.570
Did you just say "blactino"?

552
00:42:57.670 --> 00:42:59.670
Yes, I did. I'm a blactino
-American.

553
00:42:59.770 --> 00:43:01.570
First of all...

554
00:43:01.670 --> 00:43:03.770
first of all, you don't even look Latino.

555
00:43:03.770 --> 00:43:05.970
You look black.
You're... You're black.


556
00:43:06.070 --> 00:43:09.070
Second of all, I'm of mixed race,
and I've struggled my whole life


557
00:43:09.170 --> 00:43:11.470
as to whether I'm Chinese
or whether I'm black.


558
00:43:11.570 --> 00:43:13.970
Chinegro! What you are is chinegro!

559
00:43:14.070 --> 00:43:16.270
- Chinegro?
- Chinegro! There you go!


560
00:43:16.370 --> 00:43:18.470
- Chinegro?
- You are a chinegro!


561
00:43:18.570 --> 00:43:23.070
- What the is chinegro?
- That's what you are! Chinegro is you!


562
00:43:23.170 --> 00:43:25.470
That's some bulls...

563
00:43:25.570 --> 00:43:29.070
OK, as I understand it, you brought
a mixed-race flow chart with you.


564
00:43:29.170 --> 00:43:32.070
Why don’t we bring that out?

565
00:43:33.570 --> 00:43:37.370
How you doin', sugar? All right.
I'm gonna call you later.


566
00:43:37.470 --> 00:43:39.970
All right.

567
00:43:41.270 --> 00:43:42.770
Take a look at this...

568
00:43:42.870 --> 00:43:46.570
Blactino, black Asian, hispasian, OK?

569
00:43:46.670 --> 00:43:49.770
Now, for the Asian subcategories,
I got you, sister.


570
00:43:49.770 --> 00:43:52.870
We have chinegro right here.
That's you. Chinegro.


571
00:43:52.970 --> 00:43:55.070
That's not a word! 
That's not a word!

572
00:43:55.170 --> 00:43:59.370
Yes, it is, sister.
We have koreagro. Japegro, OK?


573
00:44:01.370 --> 00:44:04.670
Chispanic, koreaspanic,
and last but not least,


574
00:44:04.770 --> 00:44:07.870
check this out, y'all... japanic.

575
00:44:07.970 --> 00:44:10.170
That's how I flow with it!

576
00:44:10.270 --> 00:44:14.170
Do you believe the government should
recognise these racial subgroups?


577
00:44:14.270 --> 00:44:15.670
Yes, Jerry, I do.

578
00:44:15.770 --> 00:44:17.070
Hey, wait!

579
00:44:17.170 --> 00:44:19.970
First of all, first of all,
honey, let me tell you,


580
00:44:19.970 --> 00:44:22.770
from one, blactino woman
to another...


581
00:44:22.870 --> 00:44:25.270
- Right on.
- Our concern is education!


582
00:44:25.370 --> 00:44:28.670
You ever hear of that?! Here you are,
a 28-year-old grandmother!


583
00:44:28.770 --> 00:44:30.570
Yes, I am.

584
00:44:30.670 --> 00:44:32.770
You need to add another category
to your flow chart.


585
00:44:32.870 --> 00:44:36.470
It's called birth control, bitch!

586
00:44:40.170 --> 00:44:42.570
OK, yeah. Check this out.

587
00:44:42.670 --> 00:44:44.870
I am educated, you blactino bitch!

588
00:44:44.970 --> 00:44:46.170
What?!

589
00:44:46.270 --> 00:44:49.470
I'm a Devry graduate! And, yes,
my daughter might be a single mother...


590
00:44:49.570 --> 00:44:53.570
- I'll kick your ass! I'll kick your ass!
- Bring it, bitch!


591
00:44:53.670 --> 00:44:57.970
Jerry! Jerry!
Jerry! Jerry! Jerry! Jerry!


592
00:45:13.470 --> 00:45:16.970
- Come on, Bri. We're late, we're late.
- Dude, it's fucking Map quest.


593
00:45:17.070 --> 00:45:19.070
I told you, never again
with that piece of shit.


594
00:45:19.170 --> 00:45:20.570
Guys.

595
00:45:22.170 --> 00:45:23.670
Come meet Domino.

596
00:45:23.770 --> 00:45:27.770
Domino, I want you to meet
the co-hosts of Bounty Squad.


597
00:45:28.870 --> 00:45:31.870
Fucking... fucking... fucking...

598
00:45:31.970 --> 00:45:35.970
fucking 90210.
I couldn't get away from it.


599
00:45:36.070 --> 00:45:38.070
It wasn’t until later on that I realised

600
00:45:38.170 --> 00:45:41.170
Mum had gotten to Heiss
and pulled some strings.


601
00:45:41.270 --> 00:45:43.070
Ian Ziering.

602
00:45:44.270 --> 00:45:47.470
Brian Austin Green. Domino.

603
00:45:49.570 --> 00:45:51.270
Cocoa... Choco.

604
00:45:51.370 --> 00:45:53.470
- Cocoa?
- Choco.


605
00:45:53.570 --> 00:45:55.370
Choco. Sorry.

606
00:45:55.470 --> 00:45:57.270
The man from Afghanistan

607
00:45:57.370 --> 00:46:01.070
has made some significant
changes to the RV.


608
00:46:02.770 --> 00:46:04.570
My God.

609
00:46:18.970 --> 00:46:21.770
Are those real bones?

610
00:46:21.870 --> 00:46:24.370
Monkey... monkey bones?

611
00:46:25.070 --> 00:46:27.470
Shrunken heads?

612
00:46:27.570 --> 00:46:29.670
From my family.

613
00:46:29.970 --> 00:46:32.970
I drive these bounty hunters
for a free Afghanistan.


614
00:46:33.070 --> 00:46:36.970
I didn't know
this was gonna be a political show.


615
00:46:39.170 --> 00:46:44.270
Alf grew up during the Russian
invasion of Afghanistan.


616
00:46:49.070 --> 00:46:52.470
He had always wanted to be
part of the revolution


617
00:46:53.770 --> 00:46:56.470
but it seemed to pass him by.

618
00:46:59.270 --> 00:47:01.270
At the tender age of 14,

619
00:47:01.270 --> 00:47:04.470
he decided that explosives
would be his speciality.


620
00:47:25.270 --> 00:47:27.670
His eyebrows
never grew back.


621
00:47:30.270 --> 00:47:32.770
OK, Ed...

622
00:47:32.870 --> 00:47:35.470
What background should someone have
if they want to go into bounty hunting?


623
00:47:35.570 --> 00:47:37.970
How does jail sound?

624
00:47:41.370 --> 00:47:43.570
So, tell me, do you boys hunt?

625
00:47:43.670 --> 00:47:45.970
I killed a... I killed a squirrel...

626
00:47:47.870 --> 00:47:49.670
once.

627
00:47:53.970 --> 00:47:59.070
Well, let me tell you something.
Once you hunt a human being,


628
00:48:00.170 --> 00:48:02.770
you'll never hunt an animal again.

629
00:48:02.870 --> 00:48:04.870
You know, it's a different kind of rush.

630
00:48:04.970 --> 00:48:08.870
The problem is, is that when
you've done it for as long as I have,


631
00:48:08.970 --> 00:48:10.870
all you got to show for it is

632
00:48:10.970 --> 00:48:14.670
an empty bank account and, IBS.

633
00:48:17.170 --> 00:48:20.270
- IBS?
- Yeah, that's irritable bowel syndrome.


634
00:48:20.370 --> 00:48:25.170
You got a spastic colon?
That's hysterical.


635
00:48:25.270 --> 00:48:27.470
You know, my grandmother
has one of those.


636
00:48:27.570 --> 00:48:29.570
Does your grandmother hunt?

637
00:48:30.570 --> 00:48:33.270
Well, I don't know. Maybe.

638
00:48:35.570 --> 00:48:38.870
Why don't you just
shut the fuck up?


639
00:48:46.170 --> 00:48:49.170
You were supposed to talk about
the healthcare crisis!


640
00:48:49.270 --> 00:48:51.970
Exactly. Why would you use
Jerry Springer


641
00:48:51.970 --> 00:48:56.270
as a platform for some kind of
progressive race modification proposal?


642
00:48:56.370 --> 00:48:59.270
Well, I don't think Ted Koppel
would blook Lateesha Rodriguez!


643
00:48:59.370 --> 00:49:03.270
- Not a chance.
- Not a chance in hell.


644
00:49:03.370 --> 00:49:05.770
OK, Jerry is one of the only forums
our people have, baby.


645
00:49:05.870 --> 00:49:08.870
I thought having time on Springer
would give me a chance


646
00:49:08.870 --> 00:49:12.670
of gettin' a blook deal
or a correspondence gig on BET.


647
00:49:12.770 --> 00:49:14.270
Jenny Jones bitch got cancelled.

648
00:49:14.370 --> 00:49:16.670
Yeah, Montel would've been better.

649
00:49:22.670 --> 00:49:25.870
Lateesha's granddaughter
Mika had a rare blood disease.


650
00:49:25.970 --> 00:49:28.870
Her white cell count was dropping fast.

651
00:49:28.970 --> 00:49:30.570
Dad?

652
00:49:31.770 --> 00:49:34.070
We need money.

653
00:49:37.370 --> 00:49:38.970
I got an idea.

654
00:49:39.070 --> 00:49:40.570
What?

655
00:49:40.670 --> 00:49:42.470
Armoured car business.

656
00:49:43.370 --> 00:49:45.770
We just signed a new
insurance policy in Nevada.


657
00:49:45.870 --> 00:49:47.870
There's a loophole.

658
00:49:51.170 --> 00:49:54.370
Claremont Williams,
bail bondsman,


659
00:49:54.470 --> 00:49:58.670
armoured car service,
bounty hunter service.


660
00:49:58.770 --> 00:50:01.170
An unusual combination.

661
00:50:05.670 --> 00:50:07.670
Kee Kee, me and Claremont

662
00:50:07.770 --> 00:50:11.070
are working on a plan
to get money for Mika.


663
00:50:12.570 --> 00:50:15.870
A real good plan, baby... a good plan.

664
00:50:19.070 --> 00:50:21.270
Are you aware that Lateesha Rodriguez
has been running


665
00:50:21.370 --> 00:50:23.270
a counterfeit driver's licence racket?

666
00:50:23.370 --> 00:50:25.770
Well, that's the word on the street.

667
00:50:28.670 --> 00:50:30.970
You drove Lateesha's daughter
to school,


668
00:50:31.070 --> 00:50:34.170
then dropped her off
at the DMV. Why?


669
00:50:34.270 --> 00:50:36.570
Her car was in the shop.

670
00:50:40.470 --> 00:50:45.370
How convenient. The morning
you call in sick, I turn on the TV


671
00:50:45.470 --> 00:50:49.070
and see you all over Jerry Springer.

672
00:50:51.270 --> 00:50:53.870
- Never heard of Ti Vo?
- Think I can afford it?


673
00:50:53.970 --> 00:50:56.270
Give me a break, Pat.
What do you want?


674
00:50:56.370 --> 00:50:59.970
I got a call yesterday from
our health care provider.


675
00:51:00.070 --> 00:51:02.670
They said you tried to pass your
granddaughter off as Kee Kee


676
00:51:02.770 --> 00:51:05.470
down at City Terrace
Community Hospital.


677
00:51:05.570 --> 00:51:09.470
They said you forged the age on the
application for some sort of operation.


678
00:51:09.570 --> 00:51:13.170
Mother fuckin' HMOs
don't cover grandchildren.


679
00:51:13.270 --> 00:51:17.670
That fuckin' operation is $300,000.
Where am I gonna get the money, Pat?


680
00:51:17.770 --> 00:51:22.670
You should've thought about that
before you became a grandmother.


681
00:51:22.770 --> 00:51:24.970
Fuck you.

682
00:51:25.970 --> 00:51:29.470
You got 2 weeks
to clear out your desk.

683
00:51:29.570 --> 00:51:32.470
It just kept
getting worse for Lateesha.


684
00:51:32.570 --> 00:51:35.970
- What?
- Did I stutter? 2 weeks.


685
00:51:36.570 --> 00:51:39.370
No one could've
expected what happened next.


686
00:51:39.470 --> 00:51:44.770
By the way, there are a couple of
FBI agents here that want to talk to you.


687
00:51:50.070 --> 00:51:53.570
You're gonna go to jail
for a long, long time, Lateesha.


688
00:51:54.170 --> 00:51:56.170
Unless you cooperate with us.

689
00:51:56.170 --> 00:51:59.170
Their names
were Cosgrove and Wilson.


690
00:51:59.270 --> 00:52:02.170
Someone had tipped them off
to Lateesha's counterfeit scam,


691
00:52:02.270 --> 00:52:04.770
but that's not what
they were really after.


692
00:52:04.870 --> 00:52:06.570
I'm listening.

693
00:52:06.670 --> 00:52:09.070
In about 10 minutes,
a college kid named Frances


694
00:52:09.170 --> 00:52:12.970
is gonna walk up to your window
and ask for 4counterfeit IDs.


695
00:52:14.370 --> 00:52:15.970
You could help us out here.

696
00:52:16.070 --> 00:52:18.570
Lateesha, we want
to know what he’s up to.


697
00:52:18.670 --> 00:52:22.870
I mean, look at you. You got your hair
did, your nails lookin' all good.


698
00:52:22.970 --> 00:52:25.970
You go to jail,
that's all gonna go away.

699
00:52:26.070 --> 00:52:28.370
- Won't see your kids for a long time.
- Think about it.


700
00:52:28.470 --> 00:52:30.570
It's gonna be long as hell.

701
00:52:32.470 --> 00:52:35.370
This was when Lateesha
decided to do something foolish,


702
00:52:35.470 --> 00:52:38.770
and Frances was
in the wrong place at the wrong time.


703
00:52:38.870 --> 00:52:40.270
OK.

704
00:52:41.870 --> 00:52:46.970
OK. He and three of his friends
are gonna hijack an armoured truck.


705
00:52:49.470 --> 00:52:52.970
They're gonna walk away
with 10 million in cash.


706
00:52:53.070 --> 00:52:55.070
10 million.

707
00:52:57.070 --> 00:53:02.070
Now serving GO86.

708
00:53:05.270 --> 00:53:06.570
Hey.

709
00:53:25.270 --> 00:53:28.370
Weather Sunshine, that's for sure.
We should be at 76 degrees,


710
00:53:28.470 --> 00:53:31.670
the downtown area barely breaking
that 70-degree mark.


711
00:53:31.770 --> 00:53:35.370
66 was the high yesterday. Overnight
lows dropping down to 48 degrees.


712
00:53:35.470 --> 00:53:37.770
All right, y'all, 
Lateesha done...

713
00:53:37.870 --> 00:53:41.070
Lateesha done dug herself a deep hole,

714
00:53:41.170 --> 00:53:44.670
and, she can't get out by herself.

715
00:53:44.770 --> 00:53:46.670
Can y'all dig what I’m saying?

716
00:53:46.770 --> 00:53:49.970
Mija, we're in a hole together.
We dig together. We're a team.


717
00:53:50.070 --> 00:53:53.070
Just like Billy Ocean says:
"When the going gets tough... "


718
00:53:53.170 --> 00:53:55.470
"the tough get going. "

719
00:53:58.970 --> 00:54:01.570
There are 3 kinds
of people in this world...


720
00:54:01.670 --> 00:54:03.570
the rich,

721
00:54:03.670 --> 00:54:06.570
the poor, and everyone in between.

722
00:54:06.670 --> 00:54:09.370
Think you're having a tough day?
You should see this.


723
00:54:09.470 --> 00:54:11.570
I got an armoured truck that's empty.
Yeah.


724
00:54:11.670 --> 00:54:14.370
I think Mr Wonderful is pulling up now.

725
00:54:20.870 --> 00:54:24.870
That's Drake Bishop, owner
of the Stratosphere Hotel and Casino.


726
00:54:24.870 --> 00:54:29.070
He's worth a billion dollars,

727
00:54:29.170 --> 00:54:31.670
His attorney, Burke Beckett.

728
00:54:31.670 --> 00:54:34.570
- I'm Detective Chris Cudlitz.
- We know who you are.


729
00:54:34.670 --> 00:54:35.670
Where's my money?

730
00:54:35.770 --> 00:54:38.770
I think it’s probably best
if we take a look at the tapes.


731
00:54:43.770 --> 00:54:46.170
Our tapes show
that at 6:23am,


732
00:54:46.270 --> 00:54:50.670
your truck pulls into the parking lot
and turns the engine off.


733
00:54:52.970 --> 00:54:55.770
- Rewind, please.
- Rewind the tape.


734
00:54:59.070 --> 00:55:02.170
- Freeze the tape.
- Freeze the tape.


735
00:55:02.970 --> 00:55:05.870
- Now, can you zoom in?
- Zoom in, please.


736
00:55:05.970 --> 00:55:08.370
You a fucking mockingbird?
Shut the fuck up!


737
00:55:08.470 --> 00:55:10.170
I just...

738
00:55:15.970 --> 00:55:19.270
- Nancy Reagan.
- I think that's Hillary Clinton.


739
00:55:19.370 --> 00:55:23.170
- Fat ankles.
- It's Barbara fucking Bush.


740
00:55:23.270 --> 00:55:26.070
And Jacqueline Onassis
just to her left.


741
00:55:26.170 --> 00:55:29.670
Christ almighty, it's the goddamned
First Ladies.


742
00:55:30.470 --> 00:55:32.970
If you don’t mind me
asking you, Mr Bishop,


743
00:55:33.070 --> 00:55:35.170
what exactly is in those tan duffel bags?

744
00:55:35.270 --> 00:55:39.270
- You don’t have to answer that.
- Shut up, Burke. $10 million, cash.


745
00:55:39.370 --> 00:55:42.170
Don't tell me it was a fucking hijacking.

746
00:55:43.970 --> 00:55:46.670
How'd you get me
in this position, Burke?


747
00:55:46.770 --> 00:55:49.770
Mr. Bishop?
You have an urgent telephone call, sir.


748
00:55:50.970 --> 00:55:52.770
Yeah. Bishop.

749
00:55:53.070 --> 00:55:55.370
Bishop, this is Claremont Williams.

750
00:55:55.470 --> 00:55:58.970
I own the Williams Brothers
Armoured Car Service.


751
00:55:58.970 --> 00:56:00.170
Yeah.

752
00:56:00.270 --> 00:56:02.870
Hold on a minute, please.

753
00:56:14.070 --> 00:56:15.270
Let me isolate it.

754
00:56:16.070 --> 00:56:19.870
Yesterday I received
an e-mail from a source.


755
00:56:19.970 --> 00:56:22.670
In this e-mail were
four social security numbers


756
00:56:22.770 --> 00:56:25.470
made to counterfeit
California driver's licences.


757
00:56:25.570 --> 00:56:26.770
And?

758
00:56:26.870 --> 00:56:29.470
I believe these are the gentlemen
who robbed us, sir.


759
00:56:29.570 --> 00:56:32.770
I'm also a bail bondsman
out of Los Angeles,


760
00:56:32.870 --> 00:56:36.970
and I can track down and deliver these
thieves to you for a small finder's fee.


761
00:56:36.970 --> 00:56:40.370
- How much?
- Just $300,000.


762
00:56:41.670 --> 00:56:43.370
And what happens
if you don't deliver?


763
00:56:43.470 --> 00:56:47.570
My theft insurance policy
will have to fork over that $10 million.


764
00:56:47.670 --> 00:56:49.570
That will take 6-8 months.

765
00:56:49.670 --> 00:56:52.270
But you should know, sir,
that I employ bounty hunters,


766
00:56:52.370 --> 00:56:55.770
and my bounty hunters can and will
track down these thieves.


767
00:56:55.870 --> 00:56:59.770
Well, you deliver these crooks to me
and you've got yourself a deal...


768
00:56:59.870 --> 00:57:01.170
300,000.

769
00:57:01.170 --> 00:57:03.570
Thank you, sir. 
That's a deal.

770
00:57:06.970 --> 00:57:09.970
Crime boss Anthony Cigliutti.

771
00:57:11.470 --> 00:57:15.570
Bishop's attorney had put his boss
in business with the mob.


772
00:57:15.670 --> 00:57:17.370
They're asking for a finder’s fee.

773
00:57:17.470 --> 00:57:20.370
Finder's fee? That's bullshit.

774
00:57:20.470 --> 00:57:22.770
Sounds like an inside job to me.

775
00:57:22.870 --> 00:57:25.470
Could be. Who knows
if this Claremont Williams


776
00:57:25.570 --> 00:57:27.370
is in on the heist or not.

777
00:57:27.370 --> 00:57:30.870
All I know, if this joker
delivers the First Ladies,


778
00:57:30.970 --> 00:57:33.870
we'll split the 300,000 fee with you.

779
00:57:36.470 --> 00:57:40.270
All right, gentlemen.
Sounds like we got a little situation here.


780
00:57:41.270 --> 00:57:44.170
Quite a mess indeed.

781
00:57:44.270 --> 00:57:48.670
Beckett had just brokered
an underhanded deal with Cigliutti.


782
00:57:48.770 --> 00:57:51.670
The 10 million,
en route from LA to Vegas,


783
00:57:51.770 --> 00:57:53.270
belonged to the mob.

784
00:57:53.370 --> 00:57:57.870
Bishop's clean reputation was a great
cover for laundered cash.


785
00:57:58.870 --> 00:58:01.770
If the FBI could link
the two men together,


786
00:58:01.870 --> 00:58:04.170
it would be the takedown of the century.

787
00:58:08.470 --> 00:58:11.970
The FBI was always listening,
hence the underwater cordless.


788
00:58:20.670 --> 00:58:21.770
In Needles.

789
00:58:28.570 --> 00:58:31.870
Locus Fender was brought in
to drive the armoured car,


790
00:58:31.970 --> 00:58:34.270
another one of Claremont's
network of stooges.


791
00:58:34.370 --> 00:58:36.970
His mother Edna
worked at the Nedles DMV.


792
00:58:37.070 --> 00:58:41.070
Mama! You're not gonna believe this.
Mama, come quick!


793
00:58:41.870 --> 00:58:44.270
- Where are the First Ladies?
- They disappeared.


794
00:58:44.370 --> 00:58:46.070
What do you mean, they disappeared?

795
00:58:46.070 --> 00:58:50.170
According to Locus,
they stopped for gas.


796
00:58:51.770 --> 00:58:55.170
I'm gonna fill up the tank and grab
a Mountain Dew. Don’t make a peep.


797
00:58:55.170 --> 00:58:57.370
Especially you, Barbara.

798
00:59:04.170 --> 00:59:06.170
- Hey, man.
- Hey, how's it going?


799
00:59:06.270 --> 00:59:08.370
I need to get...

800
00:59:08.470 --> 00:59:11.170
$8 of gas and...

801
00:59:11.270 --> 00:59:13.970
A Mountain Dew.
Do you have Moonpie?


802
00:59:14.070 --> 00:59:16.570
Yeah, I got a
couple of them over there.

803
00:59:17.370 --> 00:59:19.770
And a slim...

804
00:59:19.870 --> 00:59:22.770
Shit! No, no, no!

805
00:59:22.870 --> 00:59:26.770
He was sure they'd nabbed
the cash. Straight-up double-cross.


806
00:59:31.870 --> 00:59:34.470
But they'd left without it.

807
00:59:34.870 --> 00:59:37.770
That doesn’t make any sense.

808
00:59:41.370 --> 00:59:44.170
Well, they left all the money.
It doesn’t make sense...


809
00:59:44.270 --> 00:59:47.770
Locus! Fuck ‘em. 
Their loss is our gain.

810
00:59:47.870 --> 00:59:49.670
Put the money in the freezer.

811
00:59:49.770 --> 00:59:53.070
- Mama?
- Locus... Fuck ‘em.


812
00:59:53.670 --> 00:59:54.970
OK, Mama.

813
00:59:55.070 --> 00:59:59.270
Either this was some kind of
setup, or the First Ladies got scared,


814
00:59:59.370 --> 01:00:01.270
decided to pull out and cut their losses.

815
01:00:04.970 --> 01:00:07.670
Are you wearing makeup?

816
01:00:07.770 --> 01:00:09.870
What, can you tell?

817
01:00:09.970 --> 01:00:13.170
You're wearing eyeliner, man.
You look like a drag queen.


818
01:00:13.970 --> 01:00:15.770
Who the hell is that?

819
01:00:30.570 --> 01:00:33.770
Guys, it's time.
We need the bounty hunters.


820
01:00:33.870 --> 01:00:36.570
Come on! 110%.

821
01:00:36.570 --> 01:00:40.070
Looks like Night of the Living Dead.

822
01:00:41.070 --> 01:00:44.370
Are we on? Now?

823
01:00:44.470 --> 01:00:45.370
Yeah, now.

824
01:00:45.470 --> 01:00:49.070
- Is that a joint?
- No. He's not smoking.


825
01:00:49.170 --> 01:00:52.870
Put that down. You know, television...
the people watching, those kids...


826
01:00:52.870 --> 01:00:54.070
Yeah, yeah...

827
01:01:00.170 --> 01:01:04.270
Claremont fed us a fake story
about the First Ladies.


828
01:01:06.070 --> 01:01:08.270
Are we rolling?

829
01:01:08.270 --> 01:01:11.970
So, today, Domino and her team are out
to nab four criminals for forging checks


830
01:01:12.070 --> 01:01:14.270
with counterfeit driver's licences.

831
01:01:14.270 --> 01:01:17.270
What can you tell us about
these 4creeps, Domino?


832
01:01:17.370 --> 01:01:21.570
Apparently, they call
themselves the First Ladies.


833
01:01:21.670 --> 01:01:25.970
Jackie Onassis...
his real name was Lester Kincaid.


834
01:01:26.070 --> 01:01:28.370
Yo, yo, yo yo, yo

835
01:01:32.570 --> 01:01:36.370
Hey, Rochelle.
Put your mama on the phone.


836
01:01:36.470 --> 01:01:38.070
Hey, what's happening, baby?

837
01:01:38.470 --> 01:01:40.270
Lester Kincaid, you're going to jail.

838
01:01:40.370 --> 01:01:42.870
What the fuck is this shit? Hey, man!

839
01:01:44.070 --> 01:01:46.370
I need clearances.

840
01:01:52.670 --> 01:01:54.670
- Go, go.
- Cho... Chocko... Choco.


841
01:01:54.770 --> 01:01:56.870
Jesus. This guy's a psychopath.

842
01:01:56.970 --> 01:02:01.370
What do we get for $10?
Everything you want.


843
01:02:01.470 --> 01:02:05.870
Nancy Reagan turned out to
be a sex addict named Howie Stein.


844
01:02:05.970 --> 01:02:10.370
My name is Howie, and I am
a recovering nymphomaniac.


845
01:02:10.470 --> 01:02:12.870
Yeah!
Hi, Howie.


846
01:02:22.970 --> 01:02:26.070
Now, if 2 Live Crew
has taught us anything,


847
01:02:26.170 --> 01:02:30.170
it's that horniness in today's society
is out of control.


848
01:02:30.270 --> 01:02:32.670
And at one point
within the next decade,


849
01:02:32.770 --> 01:02:34.470
mark my words, ladies and gentlemen,

850
01:02:34.570 --> 01:02:37.870
society will have reached
something I call...


851
01:02:37.970 --> 01:02:40.070
APATT...

852
01:02:41.370 --> 01:02:44.570
"All porno, all the time. "

853
01:02:44.570 --> 01:02:49.270
Pornography will have become
an epidemic in this country.


854
01:02:49.370 --> 01:02:52.370
Phase one... masturbation.

855
01:02:52.470 --> 01:02:55.470
- Who's this chump?
- That's Howard Stein.


856
01:02:55.570 --> 01:02:57.870
He's an entertainment lawyer,
some shit firm.


857
01:02:57.970 --> 01:02:59.270
Love him.

858
01:02:59.370 --> 01:03:01.370
He's so attractive.

859
01:03:01.470 --> 01:03:03.470
And to our female friends here today,

860
01:03:03.570 --> 01:03:08.670
we must not abuse of our dogs with
the lure of a peanut butter snatch.


861
01:03:08.770 --> 01:03:12.070
We must channel our horniness
into extracurricular activities.


862
01:03:12.170 --> 01:03:14.970
Howard Stein, you're under arrest.

863
01:03:15.070 --> 01:03:18.770
Whoa! Look, he's got him by the eyes.

864
01:03:26.370 --> 01:03:31.170
Barbara Bush
and Hillary Clinton were next.


865
01:03:37.770 --> 01:03:40.170
Frances and Charles Cigliutti.

866
01:03:40.270 --> 01:03:44.170
Their father was mob boss
Anthony Cigliutti. They were Mafia kids.


867
01:03:44.270 --> 01:03:47.470
We found them at their frat house, and
they'd been under FBI surveillance


868
01:03:47.570 --> 01:03:49.870
for the past six months.

869
01:04:02.170 --> 01:04:04.470
All right, boys, we're in business.

870
01:04:04.570 --> 01:04:07.470
Yeah. The bounty hunters have arrived.

871
01:04:08.970 --> 01:04:12.170
They're driving Winne...
driving Winnebagos?


872
01:04:16.070 --> 01:04:18.670
What is this shit?

873
01:04:20.570 --> 01:04:23.070
Is that the guy from
Beverly Hills 90210?


874
01:04:23.170 --> 01:04:26.670
- I fuckin' loved that show, man.
- Well, he hasn't aged well.


875
01:04:33.670 --> 01:04:36.970
We're looking for Frances and Charles!
Are they here?


876
01:04:40.770 --> 01:04:44.370
We're from a new reality TV show.
It's called Bounty Squad.


877
01:04:45.970 --> 01:04:49.370
Jesus, look at that.
She just tells it like it is.


878
01:04:49.470 --> 01:04:52.370
It's... It's... we should sign her.

879
01:05:04.170 --> 01:05:05.970
Frances! Frances!

880
01:05:06.070 --> 01:05:10.270
Frances! Frances!

881
01:05:10.370 --> 01:05:13.970
All right, 60 seconds.
Here's the question.


882
01:05:14.570 --> 01:05:16.870
Which one of you is Frances?

883
01:05:57.570 --> 01:05:58.770
This girl is gonna be a star.

884
01:05:58.870 --> 01:06:02.370
We should sign her
to a talent holding deal.


885
01:06:03.070 --> 01:06:04.770
Stay down!

886
01:06:04.870 --> 01:06:06.970
Fucker!

887
01:06:29.170 --> 01:06:31.270
Fuck!

888
01:06:49.070 --> 01:06:51.070
Fuck.

889
01:06:51.170 --> 01:06:54.170
I told him back off.
It's too psychotic.


890
01:07:10.070 --> 01:07:11.770
- Hello?
- You get all four?


891
01:07:11.870 --> 01:07:14.070
- Yeah.
- Good.


892
01:07:14.170 --> 01:07:16.470
Deliver them to the Needles DMV,

893
01:07:16.570 --> 01:07:18.970
sundown,
the Sam Kinison Monument.


894
01:07:19.070 --> 01:07:21.170
Why in the fuck out there?

895
01:07:21.170 --> 01:07:24.970
Listen, I can't even find any warrants
in the system for these four.


896
01:07:25.070 --> 01:07:28.170
The system hasn't been updated is all.

897
01:07:46.170 --> 01:07:48.570
- Hey.
- How you doing?


898
01:07:51.370 --> 01:07:54.770
- This is all an act, isn’t it?
- What is?


899
01:07:54.870 --> 01:07:58.570
This... this whole tough chick thing.

900
01:07:59.870 --> 01:08:01.970
What makes you so sure?

901
01:08:02.570 --> 01:08:04.770
I'm an actor.

902
01:08:04.870 --> 01:08:07.770
You can't fake it like we can.

903
01:08:08.270 --> 01:08:10.470
You know what I think?

904
01:08:10.570 --> 01:08:14.370
I think you're just a scared little girl
with some serious daddy issues.


905
01:08:27.870 --> 01:08:30.370
Motherfucker!

906
01:08:31.370 --> 01:08:33.770
You... you broke my fuckin' nose!

907
01:08:37.370 --> 01:08:39.170
Thanks.

908
01:08:41.270 --> 01:08:43.970
My friend Tina,
she thought you were dead.


909
01:08:43.970 --> 01:08:48.770
Really? Well, tell your friend Tina...
she's a whore.


910
01:09:00.670 --> 01:09:03.670
- It's still bleeding.
- I can’t believe this fucking bitch.


911
01:09:03.770 --> 01:09:05.870
- I'm sorry!

912
01:09:09.170 --> 01:09:11.170
Where are the bond certificates?

913
01:09:11.270 --> 01:09:13.970
There are no bond certificates.

914
01:09:16.770 --> 01:09:18.470
Claremont didn’t provide them?

915
01:09:18.570 --> 01:09:21.070
He didn't give me anything.

916
01:09:21.170 --> 01:09:24.170
Hey, Claremont said
drop the First Ladies off in Needles,


917
01:09:24.270 --> 01:09:27.470
go home and don't ask any questions.

918
01:09:32.770 --> 01:09:37.370
There's only one reason that we
wouldn’t have any bond certificates.


919
01:09:43.370 --> 01:09:46.070
These guys have never been arrested.

920
01:09:47.870 --> 01:09:50.870
Is this an inside job?

921
01:10:15.070 --> 01:10:18.070
- No, that's bullshit...
- Do you believe what's going on?


922
01:10:18.170 --> 01:10:21.070
No, I didn't sign on for this shit, Terry.
I got punched in the...


923
01:10:21.170 --> 01:10:24.170
Get the fuckin' camera
off me right now, please.


924
01:10:25.870 --> 01:10:30.470
Put down the camera.
Turn the fucking camera off!


925
01:10:30.570 --> 01:10:33.070
What happens now?

926
01:10:33.170 --> 01:10:34.970
The tour is cancelled.

927
01:10:35.070 --> 01:10:37.470
You drove us to Needles
to putus in jail?


928
01:10:37.470 --> 01:10:39.970
Come on, move! Getup. Come on.

929
01:10:39.970 --> 01:10:42.270
Turn the fucking camera off!

930
01:10:42.370 --> 01:10:44.770
Don’t listen to her. Keep filming.

931
01:10:44.870 --> 01:10:46.170
Fucker!

932
01:10:55.070 --> 01:10:57.070
Fuck!

933
01:11:09.670 --> 01:11:12.470
- I ain't worth this shit.
- Shut the fuck up and walk.


934
01:11:12.570 --> 01:11:14.270
- These aren't cops.
- No shit.


935
01:11:14.370 --> 01:11:16.370
Watch your mouth. 
God is listening.

936
01:11:16.470 --> 01:11:18.470
Come over here, good-looking.

937
01:11:18.570 --> 01:11:20.670
Here's your First Ladies.

938
01:11:20.770 --> 01:11:23.570
Pleasure doing business with you.

939
01:11:23.670 --> 01:11:26.170
She told me she was 18.

940
01:11:39.670 --> 01:11:42.870
- Ow. Fuck!
- I hit my head, too.


941
01:11:42.870 --> 01:11:47.670
Why the fuck are we staying
in this shithole? This is ridiculous.


942
01:11:47.670 --> 01:11:49.470
Guys.

943
01:11:51.770 --> 01:11:55.070
The footage we captured for that
was phenomenal.


944
01:11:55.170 --> 01:11:56.970
Did you get the broken fuckin' nose?

945
01:11:57.070 --> 01:11:59.870
- It's gonna jumpstart your careers.
- Fuck, yeah.


946
01:11:59.970 --> 01:12:02.170
Look at my face!

947
01:12:02.270 --> 01:12:04.270
It's all good.

948
01:12:08.170 --> 01:12:11.570
You need to start thinking more
positively. We need to celebrate.


949
01:12:11.670 --> 01:12:14.770
- We need to go to, like, a strip club.
- All right.


950
01:12:25.770 --> 01:12:28.270
Something awful
was about to happen.


951
01:12:41.770 --> 01:12:43.970
I could feel it in my bones.

952
01:13:12.370 --> 01:13:16.270
What?

953
01:13:28.570 --> 01:13:31.370
Do you mind if
I ask you a question?

954
01:13:33.070 --> 01:13:35.870
Do I look like I speak Spanish?

955
01:13:36.870 --> 01:13:40.370
Do I look South American to you?
I don't understand


956
01:13:40.370 --> 01:13:42.070
a word you're fucking saying.

957
01:13:42.170 --> 01:13:45.370
You know what? Ed's right.
It's not cute. It's not fucking cute!


958
01:13:45.470 --> 01:13:48.870
It's never been fucking cute, Choco!
I don't fucking understand you!


959
01:13:48.970 --> 01:13:50.870
You're a freak!

960
01:14:21.270 --> 01:14:25.770
Man, they never show the cum shots
in these shitbag motels.


961
01:14:47.170 --> 01:14:52.970
Jesus Christ, Choco. I just got done
paying 12.95 for this movie.


962
01:14:53.070 --> 01:14:57.370
- I'm never gonna know how it ends.
- Don't fuck with me, Ed.


963
01:14:57.370 --> 01:15:00.670
Listen, Choco, don't go goddamn
King Kong on me, OK?


964
01:15:00.770 --> 01:15:04.470
If you want to be alone...
if you need me, I'll tell you what...


965
01:15:04.470 --> 01:15:07.670
I'll be in Domino's room.
I'll be makin' up my own ending.


966
01:15:08.270 --> 01:15:10.570
Shut up!

967
01:15:12.270 --> 01:15:14.670
Come on, boy.
I'm gonna whip your ass,


968
01:15:14.770 --> 01:15:18.470
and then I'm gonna whip your
goddamn girlfriend's ass.


969
01:15:21.770 --> 01:15:25.070
- Do it!
- Hey, wait a minute...


970
01:15:28.570 --> 01:15:31.070
What are you doing? Over this?!

971
01:15:31.170 --> 01:15:33.570
- Pull the fuckin' trigger.
- I will fucking pull it!


972
01:15:33.670 --> 01:15:36.270
I know it comes easy
to a fucker like you.


973
01:15:36.370 --> 01:15:39.470
Pull it. Pull the trigger.

974
01:15:41.970 --> 01:15:45.470
You think I don't know
what the fuck's goin' on?


975
01:15:47.370 --> 01:15:49.670
Let me tell you something.

976
01:15:51.970 --> 01:15:53.970
You see this?

977
01:15:55.070 --> 01:15:57.570
There was no prison riot.

978
01:15:58.070 --> 01:16:00.470
I blew off my own goddamn toe.

979
01:16:02.070 --> 01:16:04.870
Just to numb the pain.

980
01:16:05.870 --> 01:16:08.970
Let me tell you something...
we all get weak over women.


981
01:16:09.670 --> 01:16:12.470
We all get weak over women.

982
01:16:13.870 --> 01:16:17.370
Fuckin' broads are all nuts.
They know how to kill us.


983
01:16:17.470 --> 01:16:19.170
And this kid in there...

984
01:16:19.170 --> 01:16:21.570
she's killin' you.

985
01:17:05.670 --> 01:17:08.070
Who are you?

986
01:17:18.770 --> 01:17:20.470
Sir...

987
01:17:20.570 --> 01:17:23.070
You want me to shoot 'em
in the kneecaps?


988
01:17:23.070 --> 01:17:26.670
Now, you listen to me.
Hold on one second.


989
01:17:28.170 --> 01:17:30.970
Ask them politely where the money is.

990
01:17:31.070 --> 01:17:34.870
If they don't know, just tell them
to start digging their own graves.


991
01:17:34.970 --> 01:17:37.070
OK.

992
01:17:48.470 --> 01:17:50.870
- Yeah. Hello?
- Mr. Cigliutti?


993
01:17:50.970 --> 01:17:54.070
I'm calling from the Zeta Theta Theta
house at Cal West LA.


994
01:17:54.170 --> 01:17:57.670
- Yes, yes. What is it?
- I'm sorry to be bothering you.


995
01:17:57.770 --> 01:17:59.970
- It's a bit of an emergency.
- What?


996
01:18:00.070 --> 01:18:04.470
Your sons have been kidnapped
by these crazy game show hosts.


997
01:18:04.570 --> 01:18:08.670
Wait, wait, wait. My sons Frances
and Charlie have been kidnapped?


998
01:18:08.770 --> 01:18:10.670
Yeah, I'm afraid so.

999
01:18:16.470 --> 01:18:21.170
We don't know about any money.
We were just going to get fake IDs.


1000
01:18:21.270 --> 01:18:25.870
Forgive us, O Lord,
for our daily trespasses...


1001
01:18:27.270 --> 01:18:29.670
for we know not what we do,

1002
01:18:29.770 --> 01:18:32.370
and what we see...

1003
01:18:32.670 --> 01:18:34.670
may not be the truth.

1004
01:18:35.270 --> 01:18:39.070
I'm gonna fill up the tank and grab
a Mountain Dew. Don’t make a peep.


1005
01:18:39.170 --> 01:18:40.370
Especially you, Barbara.

1006
01:18:41.970 --> 01:18:46.570
The three sassy black women
and Raul were the real First Ladies.


1007
01:18:48.470 --> 01:18:50.370
- What now?
- I don't know.


1008
01:18:57.570 --> 01:18:59.470
Hello? Where are you?!

1009
01:18:59.470 --> 01:19:02.970
I'm pullin' up right now.
Evacuate the van, Tee.


1010
01:19:03.070 --> 01:19:05.770
Plans have changed.
We setup the wrong guys.


1011
01:19:12.870 --> 01:19:15.770
The four guys we nabbed
were just Lateesha's patsies.


1012
01:19:15.870 --> 01:19:18.670
It was her sorry luck
they were connected to the mob.


1013
01:19:18.770 --> 01:19:20.970
Get out! Get out of the car!

1014
01:19:40.970 --> 01:19:43.770
You have fucked us so bad.

1015
01:19:43.870 --> 01:19:45.670
- I fucked up?
- You heard me.


1016
01:19:45.770 --> 01:19:49.670
You can't help your black, greedy, lyin'
ass from tryin' to get every fuckin' thing.


1017
01:19:49.770 --> 01:19:54.070
All you did is put a death sentence
on my grandbaby. That's all you did.


1018
01:19:54.370 --> 01:19:57.470
- Did you know what I was trying to do?
- What?


1019
01:19:57.570 --> 01:19:59.770
What was you tryin' to do, Claremont?!

1020
01:19:59.870 --> 01:20:02.470
- I ain't talkin' to y'all.
- What was you tryin' to get done?


1021
01:20:02.570 --> 01:20:05.270
Shut the fuck up! Everybody!

1022
01:20:05.370 --> 01:20:07.370
You mad because you fucked up!

1023
01:20:07.370 --> 01:20:09.270
Who told you to get
those boys involved?


1024
01:20:09.370 --> 01:20:11.070
What the fuck else did you want?!

1025
01:20:11.170 --> 01:20:13.270
Let's go home right now!

1026
01:20:33.570 --> 01:20:34.470
Hi.

1027
01:20:34.570 --> 01:20:36.570
Domino, we got a problem.

1028
01:20:36.670 --> 01:20:40.470
Lateesha's assumed
the FBI was onto the scam...


1029
01:20:40.570 --> 01:20:42.470
the fake ID scam.

1030
01:20:42.570 --> 01:20:45.070
She sets up these college kids.

1031
01:20:45.170 --> 01:20:48.870
These kids have been under
FBI surveillance for the last 6 months.


1032
01:20:48.970 --> 01:20:52.470
- What happened to them?
- They might be dead already.


1033
01:20:56.070 --> 01:21:01.370
There's something else
you should know about these kids.


1034
01:21:01.470 --> 01:21:05.070
They're Mafia kids, 
Cigliutti's kids.

1035
01:21:05.370 --> 01:21:07.870
Jesus Christ.

1036
01:21:07.970 --> 01:21:12.870
What, Anthony Cigliutti? Fuck,
Claremont! You've so fucked us up.


1037
01:21:12.970 --> 01:21:16.270
You set me up to deliver...

1038
01:21:16.370 --> 01:21:21.070
fucking Mafia crime boss children
to be executed.


1039
01:21:21.170 --> 01:21:26.170
Just relax. Just follow my instructions
and we all walk away from this clean.


1040
01:21:28.270 --> 01:21:30.770
Claremont laid it
all out on the table.


1041
01:21:30.870 --> 01:21:34.170
His plan was to ask for
a $300,000 finder's fee


1042
01:21:34.270 --> 01:21:38.670
to recover the 10 million he'd stolen.
It all became a huge cluster fuck


1043
01:21:38.770 --> 01:21:42.970
when Lateesha tried to pin it
on the Cigliutti kids.


1044
01:21:43.070 --> 01:21:45.170
Now our only chance for survival

1045
01:21:45.270 --> 01:21:47.870
was to stay on course
and retrieve the money.


1046
01:21:47.970 --> 01:21:49.570
Alf, come on!

1047
01:21:49.670 --> 01:21:54.070
First priority was to cut loose
the crew and sabotage the footage.


1048
01:21:54.170 --> 01:21:55.570
We couldn't leave
any evidence behind.


1049
01:21:55.570 --> 01:21:57.970
Come on, guys! 
It's time to go!

1050
01:21:58.070 --> 01:22:01.370
Alf, go grab all the footage,
every tape you see. Come on!


1051
01:22:01.370 --> 01:22:05.070
We gotta go find Locus Fender.
He knows exactly where the money is.


1052
01:22:05.170 --> 01:22:09.670
We find the money, we return it to
Bishop, we're in the clear. Come on!


1053
01:22:12.270 --> 01:22:13.570
I knew in my heart of hearts

1054
01:22:13.670 --> 01:22:16.370
we should've stopped
when my goldfish died.


1055
01:22:16.470 --> 01:22:19.070
It was a sign from a higher power.

1056
01:22:20.170 --> 01:22:22.970
Alf!

1057
01:22:24.370 --> 01:22:27.270
For fuck's sake, Alf!

1058
01:22:30.570 --> 01:22:33.170
Where the fuck are the tapes?

1059
01:23:03.870 --> 01:23:05.470
Based on Claremont's plan,

1060
01:23:05.570 --> 01:23:08.770
we joined forces with
Lashandra and Lashindra.


1061
01:23:10.970 --> 01:23:13.270
- You want a lap dance?
- Yeah.


1062
01:23:13.370 --> 01:23:16.670
Tonight we have a 2-for-1 special
for these luscious tits.


1063
01:23:16.770 --> 01:23:18.870
Luscious tits.

1064
01:23:19.370 --> 01:23:21.770
Come on. Come on, baby.

1065
01:23:33.270 --> 01:23:37.170
What's goin' on?
What the fuck?! I didn't do anything!


1066
01:23:41.570 --> 01:23:45.470
I kicked ass at the fucking audition.
Seriously, I really was great.


1067
01:23:49.170 --> 01:23:51.270
My agent called
and says that I'm too old.


1068
01:23:59.670 --> 01:24:02.370
Ian, how you doing?
You all right? Yeah?


1069
01:24:20.570 --> 01:24:23.070
Domino, Domino,
now, listen to me.


1070
01:24:23.170 --> 01:24:25.470
The combination code is
tattooed on his right arm.


1071
01:24:25.570 --> 01:24:28.070
You will never get inside
Edna Fender's safe


1072
01:24:28.170 --> 01:24:32.370
unless you have the code breaker
on that arm. Understand?


1073
01:24:32.470 --> 01:24:34.370
You're breaking up. 
I can't hear you.

1074
01:24:34.470 --> 01:24:36.970
Listen, Edna's armed and dangerous...

1075
01:24:37.070 --> 01:24:38.670
So don't fuck around.

1076
01:24:38.770 --> 01:24:41.870
- What?
- Remove the right arm.


1077
01:24:41.970 --> 01:24:45.970
- You're breaking up.
- Domino, remove the right arm.


1078
01:24:52.370 --> 01:24:56.170
Remove his shirt
from his upper right arm.


1079
01:24:56.270 --> 01:25:00.070
You'll find the combination inside
the tattoo on his arm. You got me?


1080
01:25:17.470 --> 01:25:19.870
What did he say?

1081
01:25:27.070 --> 01:25:30.070
He said, "Remove the right arm. "

1082
01:26:49.770 --> 01:26:51.670
You're fuckin' crazy!

1083
01:26:52.570 --> 01:26:53.870
Phew!

1084
01:26:53.970 --> 01:26:56.870
My fuckin' arm!

1085
01:27:14.970 --> 01:27:17.670
So, now we're back where we started.

1086
01:27:18.970 --> 01:27:20.270
We sure are.

1087
01:27:24.770 --> 01:27:28.970
Edna! You beautiful thing, come on out.

1088
01:27:29.170 --> 01:27:31.970
We found the money in the freezer.
It was all there.


1089
01:27:39.370 --> 01:27:41.770
That's a lot to carry.

1090
01:27:44.670 --> 01:27:49.170
How about a pot of coffee, Edna?
It's gonna be a long night.


1091
01:27:50.070 --> 01:27:52.270
...part light-induced, part drug.

1092
01:27:57.870 --> 01:28:03.070
Turned out Edna
had one last trick up her sleeve.


1093
01:28:14.170 --> 01:28:16.670
Cocksuckers gonna pay.

1094
01:28:20.570 --> 01:28:22.870
Mescaline.

1095
01:28:24.070 --> 01:28:26.870
With each passing second,

1096
01:28:26.870 --> 01:28:30.770
reality eclipsed
into the asphalt horizon.


1097
01:28:34.270 --> 01:28:37.770
Soon, the mescaline was
pulsing through our veins.


1098
01:28:40.270 --> 01:28:43.470
...pulsing through our veins.

1099
01:29:43.670 --> 01:29:46.370
There is mescaline in your system,

1100
01:29:46.470 --> 01:29:48.670
but I'm guessing it's nothing new.

1101
01:29:49.470 --> 01:29:52.070
It's not unusual for someone like you...

1102
01:29:54.870 --> 01:29:57.470
pampered her whole life...

1103
01:29:58.770 --> 01:30:02.970
to indulge in drugs
as a coping mechanism.


1104
01:30:05.970 --> 01:30:08.670
Not living up to your expectations.

1105
01:30:10.370 --> 01:30:13.370
Certainly not up to your mother's.

1106
01:30:14.070 --> 01:30:16.470
You know you're a heartbreak to her,
don’t you?


1107
01:30:17.270 --> 01:30:20.270
Now the bitch
was getting personal.


1108
01:30:42.870 --> 01:30:45.470
You lost everything that belongs to you.

1109
01:30:45.570 --> 01:30:47.770
You can take responsibility for it, or not.

1110
01:30:47.770 --> 01:30:51.370
Either way, you've got
no one to blame but yourself.


1111
01:32:32.770 --> 01:32:35.070
Hey, there's someone coming.

1112
01:32:44.670 --> 01:32:46.570
Hey!

1113
01:32:47.370 --> 01:32:49.470
David!

1114
01:32:54.370 --> 01:32:55.970
We need help.

1115
01:32:56.070 --> 01:32:59.570
Miracles. You're all miracles.

1116
01:32:59.670 --> 01:33:01.970
Thank you! Thank God!

1117
01:33:24.270 --> 01:33:26.370
What's your name?

1118
01:33:27.270 --> 01:33:29.270
Domino.

1119
01:33:36.870 --> 01:33:39.470
I know you.

1120
01:33:42.870 --> 01:33:44.970
You're the angel of fire.

1121
01:33:45.070 --> 01:33:47.270
Angel of fire.

1122
01:33:50.170 --> 01:33:51.770
I know you.

1123
01:33:51.870 --> 01:33:54.770
You burn bright enough
to know there are certain sacrifices


1124
01:33:54.870 --> 01:33:57.470
that need to be made.

1125
01:34:03.570 --> 01:34:07.470
You see, if you don't give back
the money, you all will die.


1126
01:34:09.870 --> 01:34:14.670
And you will die contorted,
and you will die unforgiven.


1127
01:34:14.770 --> 01:34:19.770
You see, there's... there's this...
this puzzle,


1128
01:34:19.870 --> 01:34:22.970
and at the centre of this puzzle,
there's a child,


1129
01:34:23.070 --> 01:34:25.570
and this is a very sick child.

1130
01:34:25.670 --> 01:34:27.970
Avery sick child.

1131
01:34:31.170 --> 01:34:34.570
But this child will be
a great leader someday.


1132
01:34:34.670 --> 01:34:37.370
Do you know the child I speak of?

1133
01:34:38.170 --> 01:34:39.870
Yes.

1134
01:34:40.670 --> 01:34:45.670
Well, you have only one destiny,
and that destiny is...


1135
01:34:46.970 --> 01:34:51.570
that you must offer your lives
in exchange for the life of the child.


1136
01:34:52.270 --> 01:34:54.170
Then, and only then,

1137
01:34:54.270 --> 01:34:57.870
will you truly be cleansed
in the blood of the lamb.


1138
01:35:09.270 --> 01:35:11.370
Take us to Vegas.

1139
01:35:48.870 --> 01:35:50.670
It's official.

1140
01:35:51.670 --> 01:35:54.270
Bishop whacked Frances and Chuckie.

1141
01:35:57.370 --> 01:36:00.870
- What's our options?
- What's your options?


1142
01:36:06.570 --> 01:36:08.070
Kill them.

1143
01:36:08.170 --> 01:36:11.370
When?

1144
01:36:14.470 --> 01:36:16.870
- When?
- Tonight!


1145
01:36:16.970 --> 01:36:18.670
Kill them all.

1146
01:36:18.770 --> 01:36:20.870
Kill them all tonight!

1147
01:36:24.170 --> 01:36:25.770
Go! Go!

1148
01:36:25.870 --> 01:36:28.070
Let's go! Move it out!

1149
01:36:39.870 --> 01:36:43.770
You know, we discovered the bodies
early this morning.


1150
01:36:45.070 --> 01:36:46.970
The FBI was lying.

1151
01:36:47.070 --> 01:36:49.870
The guys we nabbed
weren't dead after all.


1152
01:37:00.370 --> 01:37:04.070
Please, I just supply them with pussy.

1153
01:37:04.170 --> 01:37:07.370
I justwant to get people high, man.

1154
01:37:08.870 --> 01:37:10.770
Fuck 'em. They don't know.

1155
01:37:39.770 --> 01:37:41.870
Fuck, this shit's intense.

1156
01:37:41.970 --> 01:37:45.070
Ian, just do what they say.
I don’t feel like getting killed.


1157
01:37:45.170 --> 01:37:47.270
We need you to book us
a hotel suite.


1158
01:37:47.370 --> 01:37:50.170
- What, with my money?
- Put it on your credit card.


1159
01:37:50.270 --> 01:37:53.970
Are you serious?
OK, don't look at me that way.


1160
01:38:08.670 --> 01:38:10.370
- This is Bishop.
- Mr Bishop,


1161
01:38:10.470 --> 01:38:13.370
the bounty hunters have arrived.
Where do you want to meet?


1162
01:38:13.470 --> 01:38:17.170
Top of the World at the Stratosphere.
Yeah, it's completely secure.


1163
01:38:17.270 --> 01:38:22.270
We'll drop off the money in exactly
one hour. Should we say, 7pm?


1164
01:38:22.370 --> 01:38:23.870
Yeah, good.

1165
01:38:23.970 --> 01:38:29.170
We'll drop off the money in exactly
one hour. Should we say, 7pm?


1166
01:38:29.270 --> 01:38:32.970
All right, boys, we're in business.

1167
01:38:37.970 --> 01:38:41.670
We could let Cigliutti think
that the kids are still dead.


1168
01:38:41.770 --> 01:38:45.770
Yeah, and then we can flush out
Cigliutti in the money exchange.


1169
01:38:45.870 --> 01:38:48.270
Yeah!

1170
01:38:50.470 --> 01:38:53.470
Wilson...
They're on the move.


1171
01:39:00.570 --> 01:39:01.670
Yeah, what?

1172
01:39:01.770 --> 01:39:04.770
Yeah, Mr Cigliutti, the money exchange
with Drake Bishop


1173
01:39:04.870 --> 01:39:10.070
will occur on the top floor suite of
the Stratosphere at exactly 7pm.


1174
01:39:11.470 --> 01:39:15.770
Sounds like we got a negro
Deep Throat here. Right?


1175
01:39:18.770 --> 01:39:21.270
Man, we are so fucked.

1176
01:39:22.670 --> 01:39:26.170
Yeah, well, that guy said
we were fucked either way.


1177
01:39:35.770 --> 01:39:38.670
- Hello?
- Domino...


1178
01:39:38.770 --> 01:39:43.670
the money exchange will take place
at Top of the World, Stratosphere.


1179
01:39:43.770 --> 01:39:46.770
And I need you
to get there right at 7pm.


1180
01:39:48.170 --> 01:39:52.970
I'm sorry it turned out like this.
I won’t forget this, Domino.


1181
01:40:23.570 --> 01:40:25.770
Get off.

1182
01:40:29.770 --> 01:40:31.870
Lateesha.

1183
01:40:32.870 --> 01:40:35.570
What the fuck have you gotten us into?

1184
01:40:35.670 --> 01:40:39.370
Claremont negotiated a finder’s fee
for $300,000.


1185
01:40:39.470 --> 01:40:41.970
He fucked it up
'cause he tried to take all of it.


1186
01:40:42.070 --> 01:40:45.070
- Bullshit. You set us up.
- Fuck you.


1187
01:40:51.170 --> 01:40:54.870
Domino, if I could take it all back,
I would.


1188
01:40:56.070 --> 01:40:59.370
Well, they're gonna kill us
if we don't deliver all the money.


1189
01:41:09.770 --> 01:41:13.470
$300,000, and I need to collect
that fee right now.


1190
01:41:14.870 --> 01:41:18.470
It'll pay for my baby's entire operation.

1191
01:41:19.170 --> 01:41:21.470
Please.

1192
01:41:36.670 --> 01:41:39.470
Alf, what the fuck
are you doing in there?!


1193
01:41:39.570 --> 01:41:40.970
Alf!

1194
01:41:42.870 --> 01:41:46.570
Wanker, cut the drama.
I need 300k from one of the bags.


1195
01:42:13.870 --> 01:42:15.970
I love you, Domino.

1196
01:42:16.070 --> 01:42:17.670
Thank you.

1197
01:42:41.970 --> 01:42:46.070
This is your last chance. Once I walk
out that door, I can't help you.


1198
01:42:47.670 --> 01:42:50.270
You have a fondness for tattoos.

1199
01:42:53.270 --> 01:42:56.570
You've been staring
at my goldfish all afternoon.


1200
01:42:58.070 --> 01:43:00.070
It's a koi, actually.

1201
01:43:00.170 --> 01:43:02.470
The Japanese refer
to them as shiro muji,


1202
01:43:02.570 --> 01:43:05.270
which, translated, means "white...

1203
01:43:06.170 --> 01:43:08.370
and nothing else. "

1204
01:43:10.570 --> 01:43:13.570
Do you know why I really
became a bounty hunter?


1205
01:43:14.170 --> 01:43:16.670
Because of cunts like me?

1206
01:43:20.570 --> 01:43:24.470
It kills you that
while I'm coming into my own,


1207
01:43:24.570 --> 01:43:27.570
you're stuck
in some dead-end marriage.


1208
01:43:27.670 --> 01:43:30.170
Or, worse yet, an unfulfilling job.

1209
01:43:30.270 --> 01:43:32.970
I'm not married.

1210
01:43:33.470 --> 01:43:36.270
And I love my job.

1211
01:43:37.870 --> 01:43:39.970
Where are you hiding your tattoo?

1212
01:43:40.070 --> 01:43:41.770
Is it on your ankle?

1213
01:43:41.770 --> 01:43:44.670
No. Or is it somewhere else?

1214
01:43:44.770 --> 01:43:47.370
Is it somewhere nasty?

1215
01:43:48.270 --> 01:43:51.470
I'm picturing something...
picturing something delicate,


1216
01:43:51.570 --> 01:43:55.070
like a rose, or... or a hummingbird.

1217
01:43:55.170 --> 01:43:57.870
Or, no. Maybe it's
the name of a man

1218
01:43:57.970 --> 01:44:00.370
that you can't bring home to Daddy.

1219
01:44:03.970 --> 01:44:05.970
No.

1220
01:44:05.970 --> 01:44:09.270
No, I'm completely wrong,
aren't I, Taryn?


1221
01:44:09.370 --> 01:44:10.770
God.

1222
01:44:10.770 --> 01:44:14.070
See, I bet... I'm thinking...

1223
01:44:14.170 --> 01:44:17.770
that when you go to sleep
alone tonight...


1224
01:44:18.970 --> 01:44:21.270
it's my pussy you'll be dreaming of.

1225
01:44:21.970 --> 01:44:23.870
Really?

1226
01:46:03.770 --> 01:46:05.270
Brian...

1227
01:46:05.970 --> 01:46:07.870
I love you, bro.

1228
01:46:49.270 --> 01:46:51.670
Welcome to the Top of the World.

1229
01:46:56.070 --> 01:46:59.370
It's a little out of the way,
but, very private.


1230
01:47:02.670 --> 01:47:04.870
Where have I seen
you two boys before?


1231
01:47:04.970 --> 01:47:06.870
We're actors.

1232
01:47:06.970 --> 01:47:08.870
What the fuck are you doing here?

1233
01:47:08.970 --> 01:47:12.370
- We're celebrity hostages.
- Celebrity hostages?


1234
01:47:12.470 --> 01:47:14.970
Yeah. Apparently, people
don't kill other people


1235
01:47:15.070 --> 01:47:17.770
when celebrities are around.

1236
01:47:18.470 --> 01:47:20.670
Brings too much attention.

1237
01:47:21.770 --> 01:47:23.470
I see.

1238
01:47:23.570 --> 01:47:27.470
Well, I'd better have you
escorted downstairs, then.


1239
01:47:45.770 --> 01:47:48.370
You got lucky.

1240
01:48:01.670 --> 01:48:03.970
Go! Let's go!

1241
01:48:15.570 --> 01:48:17.770
And you're a...

1242
01:48:18.170 --> 01:48:20.370
a bounty hunter.

1243
01:48:26.070 --> 01:48:29.170
- Yes, I am.
- Dangerous profession.


1244
01:48:32.370 --> 01:48:34.470
Sometimes.

1245
01:48:40.470 --> 01:48:42.570
Will maintain visual contact...

1246
01:48:42.670 --> 01:48:46.170
Will maintain visual contact with
the tactical team that's on location.


1247
01:48:47.770 --> 01:48:51.770
Could you... could you be
a little bit more specific about that?


1248
01:48:54.270 --> 01:48:58.170
It can be dangerous when you don't
know what to expect from a situation.


1249
01:49:06.470 --> 01:49:10.870
When you have absolutely no idea
what could possibly happen next.


1250
01:49:19.270 --> 01:49:22.870
The bags contain the 10million,
minus the $300,000 finder's fee


1251
01:49:22.970 --> 01:49:25.170
you negotiated with Claremont.

1252
01:49:25.570 --> 01:49:30.970
Well, now, that's...
that's what I call bold, Miss Harvey.


1253
01:49:31.370 --> 01:49:34.670
But I'm impressed.
I'm very impressed.


1254
01:49:34.770 --> 01:49:36.370
Go!

1255
01:49:42.970 --> 01:49:47.670
All right, gentlemen, let's make sure that
those bags are packed with my money,


1256
01:49:47.770 --> 01:49:51.470
and we'll let these bounty hunters go.

1257
01:49:51.570 --> 01:49:53.670
Your money's gone.

1258
01:49:56.070 --> 01:49:57.970
What?

1259
01:50:02.770 --> 01:50:03.970
What are you talking about?

1260
01:50:04.070 --> 01:50:07.170
It has been sent
to help free Afghanistan.


1261
01:50:07.270 --> 01:50:08.770
Let us go.

1262
01:50:10.470 --> 01:50:13.370
- Let us go.
- What the fuck are you doing?


1263
01:50:22.370 --> 01:50:24.270
It's a bomb!

1264
01:50:46.670 --> 01:50:49.070
OK, drop the weapons!

1265
01:50:56.770 --> 01:51:01.470
- You killed my sons.
- I didn't kill your sons.


1266
01:51:01.870 --> 01:51:04.770
I'm not in the people-killing business.

1267
01:51:10.470 --> 01:51:11.570
No!

1268
01:51:34.470 --> 01:51:35.970
Alf!

1269
01:51:37.570 --> 01:51:41.570
- What the fuck's going on up there?
- Get somebody in there!


1270
01:52:01.670 --> 01:52:04.270
Mayday, mayday. This is Victor Bravo.
We're going down.


1271
01:52:07.070 --> 01:52:08.970
Repeat, I'm going down.

1272
01:52:12.070 --> 01:52:14.070
Heads, you live.

1273
01:52:14.770 --> 01:52:16.770
Tails, you die.

1274
01:52:18.470 --> 01:52:20.770
Tails, you die.

1275
01:52:25.570 --> 01:52:27.370
Tails, you die.

1276
01:52:44.270 --> 01:52:47.070
Move back, for fuck's sake!

1277
01:52:57.370 --> 01:52:59.270
No!

1278
01:53:36.770 --> 01:53:39.370
Come on, Alf!

1279
01:54:00.770 --> 01:54:02.270
I make...

1280
01:54:04.270 --> 01:54:07.470
I make everything... OK.

1281
01:54:11.570 --> 01:54:13.570
My coin was tossed.

1282
01:54:13.670 --> 01:54:16.370
50/50 chance.

1283
01:54:50.670 --> 01:54:53.270
Put it down, or I'll blow
your fuckin' brains out!


1284
01:54:56.270 --> 01:54:58.070
Fuckin' shoot him!

1285
01:55:19.770 --> 01:55:23.170
I once vowed never to invest
too much emotion into anyone.


1286
01:55:23.270 --> 01:55:25.670
- I love you.
- I love you.


1287
01:55:30.370 --> 01:55:32.570
I love you, Choco.

1288
01:55:38.970 --> 01:55:42.270
50/50 chance. Life or death.

1289
01:55:42.370 --> 01:55:43.870
Heads, you live.

1290
01:55:43.970 --> 01:55:46.070
Tails, you die.

1291
01:55:53.270 --> 01:55:55.170
My destiny was life.

1292
01:55:59.570 --> 01:56:01.570
When I was a little girl,

1293
01:56:01.670 --> 01:56:04.270
my mum took me to Las Vegas.

1294
01:56:06.570 --> 01:56:10.370
She told me that it was the most
dangerous place on earth.


1295
01:56:32.370 --> 01:56:35.470
Miss Harvey, I suggest you retire.

1296
01:56:36.770 --> 01:56:38.870
Sweet dreams, Miss Mills.

1297
01:56:40.170 --> 01:56:43.070
My name is Domino Harvey.

1298
01:56:44.370 --> 01:56:46.770
I am a bounty hunter.

1299
01:56:49.570 --> 01:56:54.370
I know that my Eddie and Choco are
staring down at me from the afterlife.


1300
01:56:57.270 --> 01:57:01.070
I now feel a sense of relief
that we will meet again.


1301
01:57:11.070 --> 01:57:12.870
Mum...

1302
01:57:14.970 --> 01:57:16.870
I love you.

1303
01:57:23.570 --> 01:57:26.370
There are three kinds of people
in the world...


1304
01:57:28.370 --> 01:57:30.670
The rich...

1305
01:57:39.770 --> 01:57:41.670
The poor...

1306
01:57:55.370 --> 01:57:57.770
And everyone in between.

1307
01:58:01.970 --> 01:58:05.270
- I'm Dr Walton.
- Mr Williams.


1308
01:58:05.970 --> 01:58:08.370
Kee Kee Rodriguez.

1309
01:58:08.370 --> 01:58:10.470
- I'm her mother, Lateesha.
- We're her cousins.


1310
01:58:10.570 --> 01:58:11.870
First cousins.

1311
01:58:11.970 --> 01:58:15.770
It seems that we
have a few things we have to look at.


1312
01:58:16.870 --> 01:58:18.970
If you're wondering
what's true and what isn't,


1313
01:58:19.070 --> 01:58:22.570
fuck off, because it's
none of your goddamn business.


1314
01:58:22.670 --> 01:58:25.470
I'll never tell you what it all meant.

1315
01:58:25.470 --> 01:58:28.370
I'll never tell you
what it all meant.


1316
01:58:29.470 --> 01:58:33.570
All that matters is
that my mission is complete.


1317
01:58:44.370 --> 01:58:46.170
I saved her.

1318
01:58:49.270 --> 01:58:50.970
And when she is older...

1319
01:58:53.070 --> 01:58:54.770
A woman named Domino will tell her

1320
01:58:54.870 --> 01:58:58.770
that there is only one
conclusion to every story...


1321
01:59:00.270 --> 01:59:02.770
We all fall down.

1322
02:00:24.470 --> 02:00:27.170
My name is Domino Harvey.

1323
02:00:37.670 --> 02:00:40.270
Heads, you live.

1324
02:00:40.370 --> 02:00:42.570
Tails, you die.
