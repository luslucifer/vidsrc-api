Woo hoo!

Jess, where's the fire?

16
00:01:21.489 --> 00:01:23.535
Too quick for you?

17
00:01:23.665 --> 00:01:25.537
No.

18
00:01:25.624 --> 00:01:28.192
But I am in no rush
to get back to


19
00:01:28.322 --> 00:01:30.281
Thanksgiving craziness.

20
00:01:30.368 --> 00:01:32.674
Yeah, I'll second that.

21
00:01:32.805 --> 00:01:35.416
I have everything that I'm
thankful for right here.


22
00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:41.335
I did not peg you for
an expert snowmobiler?


23
00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:43.076
Wait till you see me on skis.

24
00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:44.817
And snowshoes.

25
00:01:44.947 --> 00:01:47.559
And I can build a
pretty mean snowman.


26
00:01:47.689 --> 00:01:49.822
How did I not know
that about you?


27
00:01:49.952 --> 00:01:52.346
You know, a true lady always
preserves an air of mystery.


28
00:01:52.477 --> 00:01:54.783
Too late for that.

29
00:01:54.914 --> 00:01:56.698
I already know how
amazing you are.


30
00:01:56.785 --> 00:01:57.873
Come on.

31
00:01:59.614 --> 00:02:01.312
We're sticking to
trails this time!


32
00:02:01.442 --> 00:02:03.618
Oh come on, Buck Thompson.

33
00:02:03.792 --> 00:02:05.272
Take off your Ranger
hat for a minute.


34
00:02:05.403 --> 00:02:06.752
You're off duty!

35
00:02:10.408 --> 00:02:11.496
It's spectacular, right?

36
00:02:11.626 --> 00:02:12.671
Definitely.

37
00:02:12.801 --> 00:02:14.368
I love this.

38
00:02:14.542 --> 00:02:16.327
When the temperature drops,

39
00:02:16.457 --> 00:02:20.853
the stalactites aggregate and
beautiful crystal formation.


40
00:02:20.983 --> 00:02:22.091
I'll be studying the physical
underlying structure


41
00:02:22.115 --> 00:02:24.770
of this land.

42
00:02:24.857 --> 00:02:26.772
Geology rocks!

43
00:02:26.859 --> 00:02:28.121
Geology puns?

44
00:02:29.905 --> 00:02:31.429
We've been having a
lot of fun, Jess,


45
00:02:31.559 --> 00:02:33.866
these last few months but...

46
00:02:33.953 --> 00:02:35.128
That was rock bottom.

47
00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:40.568
Although getting to know you has
made me want to be boulder.


48
00:02:40.742 --> 00:02:42.266
Oh! I'm impressed with that one.

49
00:02:42.353 --> 00:02:43.832
Thank you.

50
00:02:45.312 --> 00:02:47.575
It really is beautiful.

51
00:02:47.662 --> 00:02:50.796
Every time I take a deep
breath, and my lungs freeze,


52
00:02:50.926 --> 00:02:52.798
I respect how dangerous
it is out here.


53
00:02:52.885 --> 00:02:56.584
Well, we should
probably get back.


54
00:02:56.715 --> 00:02:58.760
Your Mom is never
going to warm up to me


55
00:02:58.847 --> 00:03:01.241
if we're late for Thanksgiving.

56
00:03:01.372 --> 00:03:03.548
Mom is going to warm up to you.

57
00:03:03.678 --> 00:03:06.681
Store-bought apple
pie notwithstanding.


58
00:03:06.812 --> 00:03:08.770
Everyone knows it's pumpkin
pie at Thanksgiving.


59
00:03:08.944 --> 00:03:10.120
I don't!

60
00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:12.078
I don't know these things!

61
00:03:12.165 --> 00:03:14.820
Are your big city Thanksgivings
too posh for pies?


62
00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:17.692
No! No, it's not...

63
00:03:17.823 --> 00:03:22.828
My family is just a
little less traditional.


64
00:03:22.915 --> 00:03:27.137
Mom's just been hard to connect
to ever since Dad died.


65
00:03:27.267 --> 00:03:29.027
She's even more protective
of her traditions.


66
00:03:29.139 --> 00:03:30.792
Well,

67
00:03:31.053 --> 00:03:34.535
you're still really lucky to
have such a tight-knit family.


68
00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:38.278
I'm just not really
sure how I fit in.


69
00:03:38.409 --> 00:03:40.106
You're doing pretty good so far.

70
00:03:40.237 --> 00:03:42.674
- Really?
- Uh huh.


71
00:03:42.804 --> 00:03:45.067
Once they get to
know you like I do,


72
00:03:45.198 --> 00:03:47.983
they're going to love you.

73
00:03:48.114 --> 00:03:51.422
Do you want to maybe
spend Christmas together?


74
00:03:51.509 --> 00:03:54.425
We can go somewhere,
just the two of us.


75
00:03:54.555 --> 00:03:57.645
Spend a few hours
by a fireplace?


76
00:03:57.776 --> 00:03:59.734
Yeah.

77
00:03:59.908 --> 00:04:03.216
My uncle's got a cabin
near Howler's Bay.


78
00:04:03.347 --> 00:04:07.002
Maybe. We will see.

79
00:04:07.133 --> 00:04:09.024
I mean, we don't have to
spend Christmas together


80
00:04:09.048 --> 00:04:10.702
if you don't want to.

81
00:04:10.832 --> 00:04:13.400
In my line of work,
I can't make plans.


82
00:04:13.531 --> 00:04:16.316
Accidents, natural disasters,

83
00:04:16.447 --> 00:04:18.710
they don't really
happen on schedule.


84
00:04:18.884 --> 00:04:21.234
I just don't want
to let you down.


85
00:04:21.365 --> 00:04:24.498
I'm crazy about you.

86
00:04:24.629 --> 00:04:26.805
And I'm lucky to spend
any day with you,


87
00:04:26.935 --> 00:04:29.024
Christmas or not.

88
00:04:30.765 --> 00:04:32.898
Okay.

89
00:04:33.028 --> 00:04:34.769
Okay.

90
00:04:40.949 --> 00:04:41.949
- Hey Mom!

91
00:04:42.037 --> 00:04:43.517
Hey!

92
00:04:43.691 --> 00:04:45.127
Oooh!

93
00:04:45.258 --> 00:04:46.303
These are for you.

94
00:04:46.433 --> 00:04:47.584
Oh honey, these are beautiful!

95
00:04:47.608 --> 00:04:49.741
Thank you. Beautiful.

96
00:04:49.871 --> 00:04:52.526
I thought maybe you could
put them on the table,


97
00:04:52.657 --> 00:04:54.485
in memory of Dad.

98
00:04:54.615 --> 00:04:56.574
Oh, that's really
thoughtful of you.


99
00:04:56.704 --> 00:04:58.967
- Thanks.
- Of course.


100
00:04:59.098 --> 00:05:00.491
Okay, let me have it.

101
00:05:00.621 --> 00:05:01.729
What's the plan for this year?

102
00:05:01.753 --> 00:05:03.624
Well you get to guess.

103
00:05:03.755 --> 00:05:05.887
Okay, um... Small to large?

104
00:05:05.974 --> 00:05:07.062
Nope.

105
00:05:07.193 --> 00:05:08.586
Ah... Shiny?

106
00:05:08.716 --> 00:05:10.544
No. Well, a little.

107
00:05:10.675 --> 00:05:11.502
Antique?

108
00:05:11.632 --> 00:05:12.938
No.

109
00:05:13.068 --> 00:05:14.244
- Vintage?
- No.


110
00:05:14.374 --> 00:05:15.941
Okay. I'll tell you.

111
00:05:16.028 --> 00:05:17.986
In honor of my
Scottish heritage,


112
00:05:18.117 --> 00:05:21.686
I thought we'd go
with plaid-chic.


113
00:05:21.816 --> 00:05:23.296
I love it.

114
00:05:23.427 --> 00:05:24.732
It's genius Mom.

115
00:05:24.906 --> 00:05:26.908
It took me awhile to
paint all of these, but...


116
00:05:26.995 --> 00:05:28.275
Hang on. You hand-painted these?

117
00:05:28.301 --> 00:05:29.911
I did.

118
00:05:30.042 --> 00:05:31.522
Of course you did.

119
00:05:31.609 --> 00:05:32.784
I had nothing else to do.

120
00:05:32.958 --> 00:05:33.958
Decorate.

121
00:05:34.002 --> 00:05:35.743
- They look great.
- Thank you.


122
00:05:35.874 --> 00:05:38.006
I'm really happy you're
here helping me with this.


123
00:05:38.137 --> 00:05:39.530
Gosh, it's too bad
you have to work


124
00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:41.967
the holiday shift today.

125
00:05:42.097 --> 00:05:43.534
I know. I'm sorry.

126
00:05:43.664 --> 00:05:46.014
It's just, it's my turn.

127
00:05:46.145 --> 00:05:48.800
You know who's going to
eat everything in sight?


128
00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:51.150
Oh yeah.

129
00:05:51.281 --> 00:05:53.500
- Buck?
- Yes!


130
00:05:53.587 --> 00:05:55.067
Can you just put a
plate aside for me?


131
00:05:55.154 --> 00:05:56.851
I will. Oh! Good idea.

132
00:05:58.549 --> 00:06:00.246
Okay. Oh my step ladder.

133
00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:01.203
It already looks great.

134
00:06:01.334 --> 00:06:02.334
It does!

135
00:06:11.953 --> 00:06:13.390
Hey!

136
00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:15.653
Aunt Janine says
dinner's up in ten.


137
00:06:15.827 --> 00:06:17.568
Last one there is
a rotten eggnog!


138
00:06:17.698 --> 00:06:19.700
Yeah, you'll smell like Pyrite!

139
00:06:26.359 --> 00:06:27.665
What? It's a rock.

140
00:06:27.795 --> 00:06:29.928
Smells like sulfur!

141
00:06:30.058 --> 00:06:32.409
I like the joke!

142
00:06:32.539 --> 00:06:34.236
You know what? I'm walking.

143
00:06:34.411 --> 00:06:36.326
Then I'm walking too!

144
00:06:36.456 --> 00:06:38.216
Well then you're going
to be a rotten eggnog!


145
00:06:38.284 --> 00:06:40.373
I'd rather be with you.

146
00:06:40.504 --> 00:06:42.244
We'll find some time for us.

147
00:06:42.375 --> 00:06:45.117
Just you and me. I promise.

148
00:06:45.247 --> 00:06:47.902
Maybe we could go for
a walk after dinner.


149
00:06:48.076 --> 00:06:50.252
It's the Leonid meteor
shower tonight.


150
00:06:50.383 --> 00:06:52.342
Should be pretty spectacular.

151
00:06:52.472 --> 00:06:54.126

Um, she has been
preparing for weeks!


167
00:08:02.977 --> 00:08:05.676
Everything on this
table has been grown,


168
00:08:05.806 --> 00:08:08.069
gathered and hunted
by Aunt Janine.


169
00:08:08.156 --> 00:08:09.723
Really?

170
00:08:09.897 --> 00:08:11.508
What can I say?

171
00:08:11.638 --> 00:08:14.075
My family deserves the best.

172
00:08:14.206 --> 00:08:17.601
Well, every dish smells amazing!

173
00:08:17.688 --> 00:08:19.167
Thank you.

174
00:08:19.254 --> 00:08:20.928
We did really well this
summer with the gardens.


175
00:08:20.952 --> 00:08:22.388
Finally we were
able to pick more


176
00:08:22.562 --> 00:08:24.303
than the wildlife could eat.

177
00:08:26.087 --> 00:08:28.568
What does your family like
to make for Thanksgiving?


178
00:08:28.699 --> 00:08:32.093
Nothing nearly as
impressive as this.


179
00:08:32.224 --> 00:08:34.139
If you think this is impressive,

180
00:08:34.226 --> 00:08:36.620
wait to see what she
does at Christmas.


181
00:08:36.707 --> 00:08:40.319
Surely Jessica's parents will
want to see her at Christmas.


182
00:08:40.406 --> 00:08:42.016
Well, actually,

183
00:08:42.103 --> 00:08:44.541
my family has never
been big on celebrating


184
00:08:44.715 --> 00:08:47.065
"commercial holidays".

185
00:08:47.195 --> 00:08:49.023
The town is honoring my Dad

186
00:08:49.197 --> 00:08:51.199
with a Christmas Eve
service this year.


187
00:08:51.286 --> 00:08:53.724
Candlelight
Christmas Eve service.


188
00:08:53.898 --> 00:08:56.161
I just want to say

189
00:08:56.291 --> 00:09:00.948
how special it is to have
my family here with me.


190
00:09:01.079 --> 00:09:04.430
It's another Thanksgiving
without Walter,


191
00:09:04.561 --> 00:09:10.218
but as I look into each of your
eyes, and of course Roma,


192
00:09:10.392 --> 00:09:13.744
I can really feel that
he's here with us.


193
00:09:17.530 --> 00:09:18.749
Sorry, Mom.

194
00:09:18.879 --> 00:09:21.360
No worries. Is everything okay?

195
00:09:21.447 --> 00:09:24.058
It's Avalon County.
It's an emergency.


196
00:09:29.760 --> 00:09:31.501
Wayne Rangers to Avalon.

197
00:09:31.631 --> 00:09:32.763
Buck?

198
00:09:32.893 --> 00:09:34.112
If you can hear me...

199
00:09:34.242 --> 00:09:36.114
This is Buck Thompson. Go ahead.

200
00:09:36.201 --> 00:09:38.377
It's Meg
Rogers up in Avalon Pass.


201
00:09:38.464 --> 00:09:41.293
Meg? Long time.

202
00:09:41.423 --> 00:09:43.251
What's going on?

203
00:09:43.382 --> 00:09:44.949
Level two avalanche.

204
00:09:45.123 --> 00:09:47.560
I've got skiers trapped
somewhere out there.


205
00:09:47.734 --> 00:09:49.214
Current weather?

206
00:09:49.301 --> 00:09:50.345
Visibility is low.

207
00:09:50.476 --> 00:09:51.477
Storm is pressing in.

208
00:09:51.651 --> 00:09:53.087
My team is stretched thin.

209
00:09:53.261 --> 00:09:54.587
We could really
use your expertise.


210
00:09:54.611 --> 00:09:56.613
I'm on my way. Over.

211
00:09:59.224 --> 00:10:00.878
Avalon has had a level two.

212
00:10:01.008 --> 00:10:02.749
I'm sorry but, I have to go.

213
00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:04.185
What's a level two?

214
00:10:04.316 --> 00:10:05.316
It's an avalanche.

215
00:10:05.535 --> 00:10:06.735
I'll call Roma. 
Get her ready.

216
00:10:06.797 --> 00:10:08.407
Not yet.

217
00:10:08.581 --> 00:10:09.993
Let me assess on the ground
what rescue efforts they need


218
00:10:10.017 --> 00:10:11.932
and if they need air support.

219
00:10:12.106 --> 00:10:12.803
Meg and I have worked
together before.


220
00:10:12.977 --> 00:10:15.109
We've got a shorthand.

221
00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:17.808
I'm going to need you to
cover for me while I'm away.


222
00:10:17.938 --> 00:10:19.200
Meg.

223
00:10:20.680 --> 00:10:22.682
Who's Meg?

224
00:10:22.856 --> 00:10:24.554
Let me pack you some food.

225
00:10:24.684 --> 00:10:26.860
No time. Duty calls.

226
00:10:26.991 --> 00:10:28.601
Honey, you need
to eat something!


227
00:10:28.732 --> 00:10:29.907
You're the one who taught me

228
00:10:30.037 --> 00:10:31.648
to live a life in
service of others.


229
00:10:33.345 --> 00:10:34.781
Everything's good.

230
00:10:36.609 --> 00:10:37.697
Excuse me.

231
00:10:41.135 --> 00:10:42.572
This is Buck Thompson.

232
00:10:42.702 --> 00:10:44.245
I need my plane ready to
go down at the hangar.


233
00:10:44.269 --> 00:10:46.576
Thank you.

234
00:10:46.706 --> 00:10:48.882
Do you think there will
be more avalanches?


235
00:10:49.056 --> 00:10:50.884
It's always a possibility.

236
00:10:51.058 --> 00:10:52.166
You'll be safe in your
plane, though, right?


237
00:10:52.190 --> 00:10:53.495
This isn't my first avalanche.

238
00:10:53.626 --> 00:10:55.019
I know.

239
00:10:55.149 --> 00:10:57.499
On a scale of one to ten,
how dangerous is it?


240
00:10:57.630 --> 00:10:59.458
I don't know.

241
00:10:59.589 --> 00:11:02.592
Best-case scenario, I could
be back in a few hours.


242
00:11:02.722 --> 00:11:04.289
Worst-case?

243
00:11:04.419 --> 00:11:05.745
There's never been a
worst-case scenario


244
00:11:05.769 --> 00:11:07.609
that I haven't been about
to get myself out of.


245
00:11:07.684 --> 00:11:08.423
And I don't intend to.

246
00:11:08.554 --> 00:11:09.947
But...

247
00:11:10.077 --> 00:11:12.036
Jess, Rescue Services
is the life I've chosen.


248
00:11:12.123 --> 00:11:14.038
You're my girlfriend.

249
00:11:14.168 --> 00:11:16.170
I need you to understand.

250
00:11:18.912 --> 00:11:20.435
I have to go.

251
00:11:21.306 --> 00:11:22.307
Wait!

252
00:11:28.313 --> 00:11:29.662
Take this.

253
00:11:33.753 --> 00:11:36.669
A geologist with a lucky rock.

254
00:11:36.756 --> 00:11:39.237
What's it mean?

255
00:11:39.367 --> 00:11:41.369
It's a meteorite.

256
00:11:41.500 --> 00:11:43.371
That little hunk of rock

257
00:11:43.502 --> 00:11:46.026
is what started my
fascination with geology.


258
00:11:46.157 --> 00:11:49.247
And yes, it's my lucky rock.

259
00:11:50.814 --> 00:11:52.511
Be safe.

260
00:11:52.642 --> 00:11:54.948
Come back to me.

261
00:11:57.255 --> 00:11:58.473
I will.

262
00:12:09.354 --> 00:12:11.356
So where was I?

263
00:12:11.443 --> 00:12:14.315
Um... Cheers.

264
00:12:14.446 --> 00:12:19.277
To us ladies, to lost
loves and realities.


265
00:12:21.975 --> 00:12:24.238
Now dig in. Please.

266
00:12:51.439 --> 00:12:53.006
Don't worry.

267
00:12:53.093 --> 00:12:55.487
Buck is an excellent pilot.

268
00:12:55.661 --> 00:12:57.030
With years of experience
with search and rescue


269
00:12:57.054 --> 00:12:58.533
under his belt.

270
00:12:58.664 --> 00:13:00.057
I know.

271
00:13:00.144 --> 00:13:01.754
It's just hard to
turn the worry off.


272
00:13:01.885 --> 00:13:03.085
You learn how to live with it.

273
00:13:03.190 --> 00:13:04.230
Pass the potatoes, please.

274
00:13:04.278 --> 00:13:05.278
Sure.

275
00:13:07.064 --> 00:13:08.326
And don't worry about Buck.

276
00:13:08.456 --> 00:13:09.936
If he's with Meg,

277
00:13:10.067 --> 00:13:12.939
he has absolutely
nothing to worry about.


278
00:13:13.026 --> 00:13:16.334
Who is Meg?
Did they serve together?


279
00:13:16.508 --> 00:13:20.294
No, Meg and Roma served
together in Afghanistan.


280
00:13:20.425 --> 00:13:25.299
And Buck and Meg were co-pilots
in the Avalon Pass.


281
00:13:25.430 --> 00:13:26.736
Carrots?

282
00:13:26.866 --> 00:13:28.781
Co-pilots?

283
00:13:28.912 --> 00:13:30.652
Yeah.

284
00:13:30.783 --> 00:13:32.567
Beets?

285
00:13:32.698 --> 00:13:33.786
Sure.

286
00:13:46.364 --> 00:13:48.583
The Buck Thompson!

287
00:13:48.670 --> 00:13:50.368
Ted.

288
00:13:50.542 --> 00:13:52.500
I didn't realize Meg was
calling in the big guns.


289
00:13:53.937 --> 00:13:54.807
It's good to see you.

290
00:13:54.938 --> 00:13:56.417
Likewise, brother.

291
00:13:56.548 --> 00:13:58.004
I only wish it was under
better circumstances.


292
00:13:58.028 --> 00:13:59.108
Prep the dogs and stand by.

293
00:14:02.684 --> 00:14:03.860
Fueled up and ready to go.

294
00:14:03.990 --> 00:14:05.687
That's why you're the best.

295
00:14:05.818 --> 00:14:07.124
The skiers are experienced.

296
00:14:07.254 --> 00:14:08.386
They have a transceiver,

297
00:14:08.516 --> 00:14:10.170
but we haven't located
the signal yet.


298
00:14:10.344 --> 00:14:11.626
If they've been
pushed off the trail


299
00:14:11.650 --> 00:14:13.130
they could be
anywhere down here.


300
00:14:13.304 --> 00:14:14.653
Hopefully nowhere
near that cliff.


301
00:14:14.784 --> 00:14:16.196
With the amount of
snowfall and debris...


302
00:14:16.220 --> 00:14:17.395
They could be buried deep.

303
00:14:17.525 --> 00:14:18.962
Exactly.

304
00:14:19.092 --> 00:14:20.702
I'll need you to fly
as low as you can.


305
00:14:20.833 --> 00:14:22.071
I'll be your eyes
and ears out there.


306
00:14:22.095 --> 00:14:23.314
Let's go!

307
00:14:37.371 --> 00:14:39.025
Do you want me to
start hanging these?


308
00:14:39.112 --> 00:14:40.897
Yes, please.

309
00:14:41.027 --> 00:14:45.031
And this is our Christmas
Countdown Cookie Counter!


310
00:14:45.162 --> 00:14:47.817
Christmas can officially begin.

311
00:14:47.947 --> 00:14:49.557
Is that like an advent calendar?

312
00:14:49.688 --> 00:14:51.168
Sort of.

313
00:14:51.298 --> 00:14:53.344
But you roll the days
back until Christmas


314
00:14:53.518 --> 00:14:54.758
and have a cookie for each day.

315
00:14:54.911 --> 00:14:56.738
Because? Cookies!

316
00:14:56.869 --> 00:15:00.133
Well, I think that's
a really cute tradition.


317
00:15:01.569 --> 00:15:03.745
This is such a beautiful tree.

318
00:15:03.876 --> 00:15:05.791
Smells so fresh, like you just

319
00:15:05.965 --> 00:15:07.314
took it out of the forest!

320
00:15:07.488 --> 00:15:09.839
Ah! Never from the forest.

321
00:15:09.969 --> 00:15:12.972
From Dana at the tree farm.

322
00:15:13.146 --> 00:15:15.583
You know what could be good?

323
00:15:15.670 --> 00:15:17.977
If you talked with Aunt
Janine about working


324
00:15:18.151 --> 00:15:20.153
the Thompson Tree Detail.

325
00:15:20.327 --> 00:15:23.156
Yeah, sure! I would love to.

326
00:15:23.287 --> 00:15:26.377
But what is the
Thompson Tree Detail?


327
00:15:26.507 --> 00:15:28.727
It's an old forest
ranger tradition.


328
00:15:28.858 --> 00:15:30.642
She heads it up.

329
00:15:30.729 --> 00:15:32.600
I think you'd like it.

330
00:15:32.774 --> 00:15:34.428
Yeah, I'd love to.

331
00:15:43.220 --> 00:15:47.093
Steady Ted?
Come in Steady Teddy.


332
00:15:47.180 --> 00:15:48.834
Nobody calls me
that anymore, Buck.


333
00:15:48.965 --> 00:15:50.749
Well they should.

334
00:15:50.923 --> 00:15:52.620
You earned it.

335
00:15:52.751 --> 00:15:54.622
Thanks for guiding us
through the peaks, buddy.


336
00:15:54.753 --> 00:15:56.753
Hey man, it's awesome to
have you back on the team.


337
00:15:56.842 --> 00:15:58.583
We should catch up later.

338
00:16:00.019 --> 00:16:02.021
No, I better get back.

339
00:16:02.152 --> 00:16:04.632
Not tonight, you're not.

340
00:16:04.763 --> 00:16:07.331
You've just completed a
high-stress search and rescue.


341
00:16:07.461 --> 00:16:09.289
You need to take a break.

342
00:16:10.595 --> 00:16:13.250
Okay okay.

343
00:16:13.380 --> 00:16:15.180
I guess I'm going to see
you at the mess hall.


344
00:16:15.208 --> 00:16:15.905
Over and out.

345
00:16:15.992 --> 00:16:17.297
Copy that.

346
00:16:20.910 --> 00:16:23.521
Hey Buck.

347
00:16:23.651 --> 00:16:26.959
Would you consider
staying longer?


348
00:16:27.133 --> 00:16:30.049
I can't, really.

349
00:16:30.223 --> 00:16:33.052
I'm in for a rough winter.

350
00:16:33.183 --> 00:16:36.142
They're forecasting
record snowfall.


351
00:16:36.273 --> 00:16:38.884
And I'm seriously shorthanded.

352
00:16:39.058 --> 00:16:40.364
We need avalanche control

353
00:16:40.494 --> 00:16:42.714
and we need to start
blasting it now.


354
00:16:42.844 --> 00:16:44.910
And quite frankly, there's
no one east of the Rockies


355
00:16:44.934 --> 00:16:46.587
that has your skills.

356
00:16:46.674 --> 00:16:48.328
Please.

357
00:16:51.070 --> 00:16:53.246
Please please.

358
00:16:53.420 --> 00:16:56.336
Fine, I'll stay for a bit.

359
00:16:57.947 --> 00:16:59.339
Good.

360
00:17:02.038 --> 00:17:04.083
♪

361
00:17:04.214 --> 00:17:05.606
Hey, can you give me a minute?

362
00:17:05.911 --> 00:17:07.454
I'm just going to call home and
let them know I'm staying.


363
00:17:07.478 --> 00:17:08.653
Okay.

364
00:17:08.783 --> 00:17:09.784
I'll get you some punch.

365
00:17:16.966 --> 00:17:18.010
Buck!

366
00:17:18.184 --> 00:17:19.794
Jess! Hey!

367
00:17:19.925 --> 00:17:21.666
Hey? Buck?

368
00:17:22.884 --> 00:17:23.929
Hey, can you hear me?

369
00:17:24.060 --> 00:17:25.539
Jess?

370
00:17:25.670 --> 00:17:27.628
Jess. The reception's bad.

371
00:17:29.369 --> 00:17:31.023
If you can hear me,
the rescue went well.


372
00:17:31.154 --> 00:17:33.460
The skiers are safe.

373
00:17:33.591 --> 00:17:35.636
But I'm not going to be
flying home tonight.


374
00:17:35.767 --> 00:17:39.031
You're flying home tonight?
That's great!


375
00:17:39.162 --> 00:17:41.077
No! I'm staying.

376
00:17:41.251 --> 00:17:43.731
For a few days actually.

377
00:17:43.862 --> 00:17:46.604
A few days?

378
00:17:46.691 --> 00:17:48.693
Meg needs help with
the avalanche control.


379
00:17:48.823 --> 00:17:51.043
All this early snow
is wreaking havoc.


380
00:17:51.217 --> 00:17:52.784
Oh.

381
00:17:52.914 --> 00:17:55.091
Okay. Well, ah...

382
00:17:55.265 --> 00:17:57.180
You know what, we can,

383
00:17:57.310 --> 00:18:00.183
we can decorate our Christmas
tree on the weekend.


384
00:18:00.270 --> 00:18:03.577
I'm not really sure how long
the blasting is going to take.


385
00:18:03.708 --> 00:18:06.145
Blasting?

386
00:18:06.232 --> 00:18:08.234
Isn't that kind of dangerous?

387
00:18:08.365 --> 00:18:09.409
Buck! Come on!

388
00:18:09.540 --> 00:18:12.021
Friends are waiting!

389
00:18:12.195 --> 00:18:14.458
Look, I don't want to
keep you from your work


390
00:18:14.545 --> 00:18:16.242
Sorry, what?

391
00:18:16.373 --> 00:18:17.939
Look Jess.

392
00:18:18.070 --> 00:18:20.072
We're going to decorate
the tree next week,


393
00:18:20.203 --> 00:18:23.032
or the week after.

394
00:18:23.162 --> 00:18:25.034
I miss you.

395
00:18:25.121 --> 00:18:27.297
Me too.

396
00:18:27.384 --> 00:18:31.562
I know. Duty calls.

397
00:18:31.736 --> 00:18:33.825
Look, I'm really
sorry about this.


398
00:18:33.955 --> 00:18:34.955
I didn't...

399
00:18:35.914 --> 00:18:36.914
Jess?

400
00:18:38.482 --> 00:18:39.526
Hello?

401
00:18:40.658 --> 00:18:41.920
Buck?

402
00:18:47.665 --> 00:18:49.493
There he is.

403
00:18:49.623 --> 00:18:50.983
The man of the hour
trying to hide.


404
00:18:51.103 --> 00:18:52.539
Get in here.

405
00:18:52.626 --> 00:18:54.628
Introducing your local hero.

406
00:18:54.759 --> 00:18:56.369
Buck Thompson!

407
00:19:00.156 --> 00:19:01.635
You all did great today.

408
00:19:01.766 --> 00:19:03.594
To you!

409
00:19:03.768 --> 00:19:04.856
Cheers!

410
00:19:11.776 --> 00:19:12.951
- Hey!
- Hey.


411
00:19:13.082 --> 00:19:15.214
Is Buck okay?
Did he find those skiers?


412
00:19:15.388 --> 00:19:16.607
Yeah. Everyone is safe.

413
00:19:16.694 --> 00:19:17.694
Here let me.

414
00:19:18.957 --> 00:19:20.219
Thank you.

415
00:19:20.350 --> 00:19:21.481
That's great.

416
00:19:21.742 --> 00:19:23.024
Well, he will be starving
when he gets back,


417
00:19:23.048 --> 00:19:25.355
so Aunt Janine has
his plate over there.


418
00:19:25.529 --> 00:19:27.096
Oh, he's, um...

419
00:19:27.270 --> 00:19:29.881
He's actually not going to be
home for a couple of days.


420
00:19:29.968 --> 00:19:31.361
Meg needed him at Avalon.

421
00:19:31.535 --> 00:19:32.971
It must be serious then.

422
00:19:33.102 --> 00:19:35.452
Yeah. I'm sure.

423
00:19:42.937 --> 00:19:44.939
Buddy, you just
saved two lives, man.


424
00:19:45.070 --> 00:19:46.115
Don't look so down.

425
00:19:46.245 --> 00:19:48.204
Is everything okay at home?

426
00:19:48.291 --> 00:19:50.423
My girlfriend's disappointed
I'm staying on.


427
00:19:50.597 --> 00:19:52.295
It's our first Thanksgiving.

428
00:19:52.382 --> 00:19:55.036
What, you're not home to hang
some decorations together?


429
00:19:55.211 --> 00:19:57.517
Rescue Services, man,
it's unpredictable.


430
00:19:57.691 --> 00:19:59.432
It's hard to find
people that understand


431
00:19:59.606 --> 00:20:01.173
the stress and demands.

432
00:20:01.304 --> 00:20:03.349
Come on. Let's play!

433
00:20:03.436 --> 00:20:04.698
Don't worry.

434
00:20:04.829 --> 00:20:06.265
I'm going to let
you win this time.


435
00:20:06.439 --> 00:20:07.658
Because I feel bad for you.

436
00:20:07.832 --> 00:20:09.070
That's what he says every time.

437
00:20:09.094 --> 00:20:10.400
Uh huh.

453
00:21:23.690 --> 00:21:25.823
Good morning, Rangers!

454
00:21:25.997 --> 00:21:28.695
It's beginning to look
a lot like Christmas.


455
00:21:28.782 --> 00:21:30.958
Only twenty-five
days left to go!


456
00:21:32.873 --> 00:21:33.918
Soon.

457
00:21:35.702 --> 00:21:36.702
Okay now!

458
00:21:37.095 --> 00:21:38.183
Right.

459
00:21:38.575 --> 00:21:40.161
A huge amount of early
snow plus warm weather


460
00:21:40.185 --> 00:21:41.380
gives us a weak layer
in the snow blanket.


461
00:21:41.404 --> 00:21:42.840
Yeah.

462
00:21:43.014 --> 00:21:45.016
Weak snow pack on the
steep eastern slopes,


463
00:21:45.103 --> 00:21:46.583
it's a double whammy.

464
00:21:46.670 --> 00:21:48.498
We use digital
detonators now though,


465
00:21:48.585 --> 00:21:49.585
so it's more controlled.

466
00:21:49.716 --> 00:21:50.413
And a lot safer.

467
00:21:50.500 --> 00:21:52.371
Uh huh.

468
00:21:52.458 --> 00:21:54.243
Let's plan out the charges.

469
00:21:54.417 --> 00:21:57.637
All right. So I'm thinking we
start here, then we go...


470
00:21:57.811 --> 00:21:59.465
Yeah. And then we'll
just wipe them...


471
00:22:02.816 --> 00:22:04.340
Exactly.

472
00:22:04.470 --> 00:22:05.993
Okay.

473
00:22:26.492 --> 00:22:29.016
So then Josh and I
have to go to his stepmom's


474
00:22:29.147 --> 00:22:31.976
for a second Christmas
dinner on the 25th.


475
00:22:32.063 --> 00:22:34.674
And then we have to go to my
Dad's for brunch on the 26th.


476
00:22:38.025 --> 00:22:41.159
Hey. Are you even listening
to my holiday crabbiness?


477
00:22:41.246 --> 00:22:45.250
Yeah. It sounds
like a lot of food.


478
00:22:45.337 --> 00:22:48.775
Maybe you just need to remind
Buck what he's missing.


479
00:22:48.862 --> 00:22:51.604
Hey! Why don't you take a
pic with this little gem?


480
00:23:26.073 --> 00:23:29.076
What did you do
to her this time?


481
00:23:29.207 --> 00:23:30.948
I just replaced a pump.

482
00:23:31.078 --> 00:23:32.819
Still can't seem to
get her to go, though.


483
00:23:32.906 --> 00:23:34.691
I haven't looked at her yet.

484
00:23:35.996 --> 00:23:37.868
Yeah, you give it a go.

485
00:23:42.481 --> 00:23:45.745
You know, Buck, I ah...

486
00:23:45.876 --> 00:23:48.835
I heard you been
having some trouble.


487
00:23:48.966 --> 00:23:53.492
After you came home.
Because of the dogs.


488
00:23:56.800 --> 00:23:59.324
It's tough to get
Afghanistan out of my head.


489
00:23:59.455 --> 00:24:01.979
I'm still jolted
awake some nights.


490
00:24:02.109 --> 00:24:04.721
Cold sweats.

491
00:24:04.851 --> 00:24:07.201
Yeah, man, me too.

492
00:24:07.288 --> 00:24:09.160
Me too.

493
00:24:17.690 --> 00:24:20.040
You know, I never told anyone

494
00:24:20.127 --> 00:24:23.174
what I see in my nightmares.

495
00:24:23.304 --> 00:24:25.263
Not even my own wife.

496
00:24:27.613 --> 00:24:29.615
She already has a
pretty good idea.


497
00:24:33.184 --> 00:24:35.752
Listen, I started to
talk with somebody.


498
00:24:35.926 --> 00:24:38.363
It helps.

499
00:24:38.450 --> 00:24:42.802
It's still there but, less.

500
00:24:42.933 --> 00:24:44.978
I'll shoot you the number?

501
00:24:45.109 --> 00:24:47.894
Yeah.

502
00:24:47.981 --> 00:24:50.027
Yeah, less would be good, man.

503
00:24:53.378 --> 00:24:54.945
So, what do you think?

504
00:24:56.990 --> 00:24:58.688
What did you do to her?

505
00:24:59.993 --> 00:25:01.778
Let's see you work
your magic, Bucko.


506
00:25:19.970 --> 00:25:21.319
This is Buck Thompson.

507
00:25:21.406 --> 00:25:22.818
I'm up in snow country
and I can't say


508
00:25:22.842 --> 00:25:24.365
when I'll get back to my phone.

509
00:25:24.453 --> 00:25:25.758
But leave a message.

510
00:25:38.510 --> 00:25:40.164
Okay! Here we go!

511
00:25:43.080 --> 00:25:44.864
Any info on the guy's injuries?

512
00:25:44.951 --> 00:25:46.910
Upper body.
Maybe a broken collar bone.


513
00:25:47.040 --> 00:25:48.781
It's going to be
difficult to transport.


514
00:25:53.133 --> 00:25:54.973
Search and rescue have
got it cleared up ahead.

Does Wayne Forest
need you that badly?


532
00:27:10.689 --> 00:27:12.517
Meg, I agreed to a few days.

533
00:27:12.648 --> 00:27:14.258
It's been a few weeks.

534
00:27:14.388 --> 00:27:17.000
And I am so grateful.

535
00:27:17.130 --> 00:27:19.393
But if you ever need
a change of pace,


536
00:27:19.524 --> 00:27:21.918
maybe consider transferring
up here for a season.


537
00:27:22.005 --> 00:27:23.963
That's an enticing offer, but...

538
00:27:24.094 --> 00:27:25.835
Ah, you can't blame
me for asking.


539
00:27:25.965 --> 00:27:29.403
Look, we make a good team.

540
00:27:29.534 --> 00:27:30.883
We're good together.

541
00:27:31.057 --> 00:27:32.363
Yeah, we are.

542
00:27:32.493 --> 00:27:33.493
But I've got to get home.

543
00:27:34.974 --> 00:27:36.976
I've got to make
sure I've got time


544
00:27:37.107 --> 00:27:38.848
to fuel up and beat this storm.

545
00:27:39.022 --> 00:27:41.459
You're not fueled up?

546
00:27:41.546 --> 00:27:43.330
The storm last night
blocked all access


547
00:27:43.461 --> 00:27:45.898
to the road on the north side.

548
00:27:46.029 --> 00:27:48.727
Cars and fuel aren't
getting in or out.


549
00:27:48.858 --> 00:27:51.295
I'm sorry Buck.

550
00:27:51.382 --> 00:27:54.124
Looks like you're going to be
grounded here a few more days.


551
00:27:55.691 --> 00:27:57.475
Hey Meg. Are you coming?

552
00:27:57.606 --> 00:27:59.433
Yeah.

553
00:28:17.190 --> 00:28:18.322
Hey you!

554
00:28:18.452 --> 00:28:20.411
Hey...

555
00:28:20.541 --> 00:28:21.693
I was just going to
call you and tell you that I...


556
00:28:21.717 --> 00:28:22.848
Jess...

557
00:28:22.979 --> 00:28:24.633
There was a storm last night.

558
00:28:24.763 --> 00:28:26.330
The northern road
to Avalon is blocked.


559
00:28:26.460 --> 00:28:28.549
Oh.

560
00:28:28.637 --> 00:28:29.899
Well, if it's that bad,

561
00:28:30.073 --> 00:28:32.162
it sounds like your
plane is grounded too.


562
00:28:32.336 --> 00:28:34.077
The problem is the fuel trucks.

563
00:28:34.251 --> 00:28:35.881
They can't get through
so I can't start back


564
00:28:35.905 --> 00:28:38.037
until they clear out.

565
00:28:38.168 --> 00:28:40.823
Okay. No worries. I'll just...

566
00:28:40.997 --> 00:28:42.476
See you when I see you.

567
00:28:42.563 --> 00:28:44.565
Okay.

568
00:28:44.696 --> 00:28:46.872
Did you hear me when I
said I can't make it?


569
00:28:47.003 --> 00:28:49.005
I did. I heard you. I just...

570
00:28:49.135 --> 00:28:51.224
I'm not surprised.

571
00:28:51.311 --> 00:28:54.445
I know the weather's
bad, and your work...


572
00:28:54.575 --> 00:28:57.666
It's just the
realities of our life together.


573
00:28:57.753 --> 00:28:59.276
And I am making peace with that.

574
00:28:59.406 --> 00:29:01.191
New Year's, then?

575
00:29:01.365 --> 00:29:03.889
So you're completely snowed in?

576
00:29:03.976 --> 00:29:06.196
Not completely.

577
00:29:06.370 --> 00:29:08.677
The northern road is blocked,
the other roads are bad,


578
00:29:08.764 --> 00:29:12.115
but they're plowing them now.

579
00:29:12.202 --> 00:29:15.422
If I had my truck, I'd
be there in a heartbeat.


580
00:29:15.509 --> 00:29:18.338
Well, you may not have
a vehicle, but I do.


581
00:29:18.469 --> 00:29:20.732
Oh yeah?

582
00:29:20.863 --> 00:29:23.692
I'm coming to you.

583
00:29:23.822 --> 00:29:27.608
Jess! Jess, that's nuts.

584
00:29:27.739 --> 00:29:29.610
The weather's horrible,
the roads are bad.


585
00:29:29.785 --> 00:29:31.482
There's black ice.

586
00:29:31.612 --> 00:29:34.790
Accidents happen fast and
this temperature, it's brutal.


587
00:29:34.964 --> 00:29:36.617
I can handle winter.

588
00:29:36.748 --> 00:29:40.404
Snow shovel, bag of sand,
warming candle, blankets.


589
00:29:40.534 --> 00:29:42.232
I got it covered!

590
00:29:42.406 --> 00:29:45.757
How about I grab a snowmobile?

591
00:29:45.888 --> 00:29:47.759
I could meet you half way.

592
00:29:47.846 --> 00:29:49.892
What do you say?

593
00:29:50.022 --> 00:29:51.371
Howler's Bay?

594
00:29:51.502 --> 00:29:53.591
Howler's Bay! That's right
by your uncle's cabin!


595
00:29:53.678 --> 00:29:55.941
That's the one.

596
00:29:56.072 --> 00:29:57.421
I'll send you the coordinates.

597
00:29:57.551 --> 00:29:59.031
Okay, this is perfect.

598
00:29:59.205 --> 00:30:00.966
Although we don't really
have a very good history


599
00:30:00.990 --> 00:30:02.556
with cabins, do we?

600
00:30:02.687 --> 00:30:04.297
Yeah.

601
00:30:04.602 --> 00:30:06.909
It's a good thing bears are
hibernating this time of year.


602
00:30:07.039 --> 00:30:09.359
Although the weather can be
just as dangerous as the bears.


603
00:30:09.433 --> 00:30:10.956
Well, I'll get a
good night's sleep


604
00:30:11.043 --> 00:30:12.107
and leave first thing
in the morning.


605
00:30:12.131 --> 00:30:14.438
Kiss you soon.

606
00:30:14.525 --> 00:30:16.179
And Jess...

607
00:30:16.266 --> 00:30:17.746
Be careful.

608
00:30:17.833 --> 00:30:19.269
I will.

609

615
00:30:48.559 --> 00:30:51.823
Look, no one knows these
backwoods like I do.


616
00:30:51.954 --> 00:30:53.670
Plus my shortcuts will
get you to Howler's Bay

in half the time.

618
00:30:55.696 --> 00:30:57.611
It's Christmas Eve.

619
00:30:57.742 --> 00:30:59.222
You should be at home.

620
00:30:59.309 --> 00:31:01.790
I don't have anyone
waiting for me.


621
00:31:01.920 --> 00:31:04.314
Let me help.

622
00:31:04.444 --> 00:31:07.534
I'm the reason that you've
been here for so long.


623
00:31:07.708 --> 00:31:11.016
Plus it'll be good to
just ride for fun,


624
00:31:11.147 --> 00:31:13.279
like we used to.

625
00:31:13.410 --> 00:31:15.542
Thank you.

626
00:31:15.673 --> 00:31:18.023
Don't expect me
to go easy on you.


627
00:31:18.154 --> 00:31:20.025
It's like that, is it?

628
00:31:26.379 --> 00:31:28.381
Try to keep up!

629
00:31:38.261 --> 00:31:41.177
Merry Christmas
Eve Day, Rangers!


630
00:31:41.307 --> 00:31:44.397
I hope your day is as
merry and sugary sweet


631
00:31:44.571 --> 00:31:45.571
as these cookies!

632
00:31:45.703 --> 00:31:46.703
Come and get em!

633
00:32:03.503 --> 00:32:04.548
Hi. Oh!

634
00:32:04.678 --> 00:32:05.678
Hi!

635
00:32:08.987 --> 00:32:10.684
- Let me help you.
- Thanks.


636
00:32:10.815 --> 00:32:13.339
Thank you so much for
offering to dog sit.


637
00:32:13.513 --> 00:32:15.428
No problem! It'll be fine.

638
00:32:16.560 --> 00:32:17.735
No thank you.

639
00:32:19.693 --> 00:32:22.218
How do I get him to stop
staring at me like that?


640
00:32:22.348 --> 00:32:24.133
Oh. That's just how
he shows affection.


641
00:32:24.263 --> 00:32:25.438
He likes you.

642
00:32:25.569 --> 00:32:26.569
Oh.

643
00:32:28.441 --> 00:32:29.703
Cute. Um...

644
00:32:29.878 --> 00:32:31.140
Hi!

645
00:32:31.270 --> 00:32:32.924
Here's a nice pat for ya.

646
00:32:36.014 --> 00:32:39.148
Yeah, I'll be honest.
I'm more of a cat person.


647
00:32:39.278 --> 00:32:40.758
Because we, you know,
mutually respect


648
00:32:40.889 --> 00:32:43.065
each other's independence.

649
00:32:43.195 --> 00:32:47.112
But family helps
one another out. So.


650
00:32:47.243 --> 00:32:49.375
You consider me a
part of your family?


651
00:32:52.204 --> 00:32:54.772
Look, ah...

652
00:32:54.903 --> 00:32:57.775
I know loving someone who's
devoted their entire life


653
00:32:57.906 --> 00:32:59.995
to the service isn't easy.

654
00:33:00.125 --> 00:33:05.261
I'm just not really sure he
even wants a relationship.


655
00:33:05.391 --> 00:33:07.567
He struggles to commit
to the tiniest things.


656
00:33:07.698 --> 00:33:10.614
Try not to blame him for that.

657
00:33:10.701 --> 00:33:12.268
It's the job.

658
00:33:12.442 --> 00:33:14.226
I know.

659
00:33:16.054 --> 00:33:19.710
See? You're more of a
Thompson than you realize.


660
00:33:22.495 --> 00:33:23.627
This is for you.

661
00:33:31.026 --> 00:33:32.505
A compass?

662
00:33:32.592 --> 00:33:35.073
It was my Dad's.

663
00:33:35.204 --> 00:33:37.771
It's for good luck.
On a long trip.


664
00:33:37.902 --> 00:33:40.949
Oh, I don't want to take
something so personal.


665
00:33:41.079 --> 00:33:43.734
Please, I want you to have it.

666
00:33:43.908 --> 00:33:47.825
Just bring it, and Buck
back to us for Christmas.


667
00:33:47.999 --> 00:33:49.958
I will.

668
00:33:50.045 --> 00:33:51.152
And I'll make sure we get back

669
00:33:51.176 --> 00:33:52.743
for Walter's
candlelight service.


670
00:33:52.917 --> 00:33:56.399
Okay. You be a good boy
for Roma. Okay. Okay?


671
00:33:56.529 --> 00:33:58.270
- Thank you.
- Uh huh.


672
00:34:08.715 --> 00:34:10.674
You kind of smell.

673
00:34:18.203 --> 00:34:20.901
We're going to take a shortcut.

674
00:34:20.989 --> 00:34:22.903
But we want to go south!

675
00:34:22.991 --> 00:34:24.296
Just trust me!

676
00:34:24.427 --> 00:34:26.081
Make sure you stay on my tracks.

677
00:35:05.903 --> 00:35:07.470
Hey!

678
00:35:07.600 --> 00:35:10.473
How's the Thompson Tree
Detail this morning?


679
00:35:10.560 --> 00:35:12.301
Any suspicious behavior?

680
00:35:12.388 --> 00:35:13.998
Nothing suspicious.

681
00:35:14.129 --> 00:35:16.044
Only delicious.

682
00:35:16.174 --> 00:35:17.543
Jessica dropped these
off this morning


683
00:35:17.567 --> 00:35:19.047
on her way to go meet Buck.

684
00:35:19.177 --> 00:35:21.005
Oh! She really went to meet him.

685
00:35:21.179 --> 00:35:23.399
Must be real feelings there.

686
00:35:23.573 --> 00:35:25.488
She also promised
to have him back


687
00:35:25.618 --> 00:35:27.968
for Uncle Walt's
candle light service.


688
00:35:28.099 --> 00:35:30.014
Cookie?

689
00:35:30.145 --> 00:35:33.670
To have the metabolism of a
twenty-seven year old again.


690
00:35:33.800 --> 00:35:36.238
We've got to stay alert for
last-minute shoppers today.


691
00:35:36.368 --> 00:35:38.066
Definitely.

692
00:35:38.153 --> 00:35:39.260
It's still pretty early, though,

693
00:35:39.284 --> 00:35:40.564
if you want your morning coffee.

694
00:35:40.633 --> 00:35:42.287
I'm good to start watch, thanks.

695
00:35:45.943 --> 00:35:47.640
Aunt Janine.

696
00:35:47.771 --> 00:35:49.816
Is there a reason you
didn't you let Jess


697
00:35:49.947 --> 00:35:51.470
help with the Detail?

698
00:35:51.601 --> 00:35:54.865
And I quote "we have
it covered this year".


699
00:35:56.649 --> 00:35:59.522
It's a Thompson family
tradition, that's all.


700
00:35:59.652 --> 00:36:02.002
She makes Buck happy.
I know you see that.


701
00:36:02.177 --> 00:36:03.700
Roma and I see that.

702
00:36:03.830 --> 00:36:05.832
She might be part of
your family one day.


703
00:36:05.963 --> 00:36:09.575
When Walt left, he
entrusted the Detail to me.


704
00:36:09.706 --> 00:36:12.230
He felt it was important
that people respect


705
00:36:12.404 --> 00:36:14.189
the trees in our state forest.

706
00:36:14.276 --> 00:36:17.670
Now I'm in charge of
protecting those trees.


707
00:36:18.932 --> 00:36:20.195
Okay.

708
00:36:20.586 --> 00:36:22.501
And by not inviting her
to the family tradition


709
00:36:22.632 --> 00:36:24.764
you're just trying to
protect the forest, right?


710
00:36:26.897 --> 00:36:28.638
Not Buck?

711
00:36:36.341 --> 00:36:37.690
Hey!

712
00:36:40.258 --> 00:36:41.825
Too many rocks.

713
00:36:41.955 --> 00:36:43.131
It's too dangerous.

714
00:36:43.261 --> 00:36:44.654
Let's head back to the trail.

715
00:36:44.871 --> 00:36:48.005
Come on, we've driven
through much worse before.


716
00:36:48.092 --> 00:36:49.267
Let's keep going.

717
00:36:49.398 --> 00:36:50.616
We're almost at the pass

718
00:36:50.790 --> 00:36:51.854
and then we're not much
farther from there.


719
00:36:51.878 --> 00:36:52.966
I've seen too much.

720
00:36:53.053 --> 00:36:54.925
Let's go!

721
00:36:55.055 --> 00:36:55.839
Come on.

722
00:36:55.969 --> 00:36:56.969
Okay.

723
00:37:27.740 --> 00:37:30.961
Okay! Enough with the staring.

724
00:37:31.048 --> 00:37:32.528
You like me. I get that.

725
00:37:32.658 --> 00:37:35.661
That's great, but enough.

726
00:37:41.058 --> 00:37:42.538
At ease, boy!

727
00:37:45.367 --> 00:37:47.282
Eyes front!

728
00:37:50.937 --> 00:37:53.418
Fine.
Don't listen to my commands.


729
00:37:53.549 --> 00:37:54.811
I don't care.

730
00:37:56.160 --> 00:37:58.162
Hey! I was using that.

731
00:37:58.293 --> 00:37:59.772
No respect for rank!

732
00:38:03.298 --> 00:38:04.473
Are you okay?

733
00:38:09.739 --> 00:38:11.654
Okay. Let's get you up.

734
00:38:19.575 --> 00:38:21.229
I should have seen that log!

735
00:38:21.359 --> 00:38:23.361
It's okay. It's not your fault.

736
00:38:23.492 --> 00:38:25.494
But that log came
out of nowhere.


737
00:38:33.850 --> 00:38:37.897
Well. At least we're
close to the cabin.


738
00:38:39.595 --> 00:38:42.598
What about your shoulder?

739
00:38:42.772 --> 00:38:46.166
You're not wincing for nothing.

740
00:38:46.254 --> 00:38:47.342
You don't miss a thing.

741
00:38:47.516 --> 00:38:48.560
Nope.

742
00:38:51.389 --> 00:38:53.609
Do me a favor?

743
00:38:53.783 --> 00:38:56.133
Let me tell Ted
about his machine.


744
00:38:56.264 --> 00:38:58.242
Ah. But it would be so much
more fun if I could tell him.


745
00:38:58.266 --> 00:39:00.790
Meg!

746
00:39:00.964 --> 00:39:03.749
This old thing. 
He won't care.

747
00:39:03.880 --> 00:39:05.969
His wife's getting him
a new one for Christmas.


748
00:39:15.457 --> 00:39:17.067
Buck!

749
00:39:17.197 --> 00:39:19.025
Buck, it's okay.

750
00:39:19.156 --> 00:39:21.332
You're safe.

751
00:39:21.506 --> 00:39:23.552
Come back to me.

752
00:39:25.031 --> 00:39:26.032
Okay.

753
00:39:28.687 --> 00:39:31.560
I think it's time to go home.

754
00:39:31.690 --> 00:39:36.129
Okay. We'll get you there.

755
00:39:36.260 --> 00:39:39.742
Let's just take a little
break first, okay?


756
00:39:39.829 --> 00:39:41.961
I'll make us a fire.

757
00:39:42.092 --> 00:39:44.616
We can have some coffee.
And then we'll keep going.


758
00:39:45.878 --> 00:39:46.923
Sounds good.

759
00:39:50.840 --> 00:39:52.842
What about that storm?

760
00:39:54.931 --> 00:39:57.412
It's not supposed to hit
until later tonight.


761
00:39:59.457 --> 00:40:01.633
Long after we're both back home.

762
00:40:01.764 --> 00:40:03.069
Come on.

763
00:41:55.312 --> 00:41:56.661
No!

764
00:42:12.111 --> 00:42:13.199
Argh!

765
00:42:54.023 --> 00:42:55.023
Oh!

766
00:42:56.199 --> 00:42:57.200
Good morning.

767
00:42:57.287 --> 00:42:59.202
Good morning.

768
00:42:59.289 --> 00:43:03.728
My vehicle got stuck
in all this snow.


769
00:43:03.859 --> 00:43:05.338
Do you think you
could help me out?


770
00:43:05.469 --> 00:43:08.690
My truck won't be ready
for a couple of hours.


771
00:43:08.864 --> 00:43:11.997
I'm getting it ready for the
Christmas parade in town.


772
00:43:14.173 --> 00:43:16.093
Sorry, I don't have another
vehicle to offer you.


773
00:43:19.701 --> 00:43:21.137
You have some beautiful dogs.

774
00:43:21.267 --> 00:43:23.835
Yup. The best.

775
00:43:23.966 --> 00:43:25.794
Fast as anything.

776
00:43:25.968 --> 00:43:28.318
Yeah, I can see that.

777
00:43:28.448 --> 00:43:30.296
Every winter, I spend a few
weeks with my aunt and uncle


778
00:43:30.320 --> 00:43:31.669
up in Alaska.

779
00:43:31.843 --> 00:43:34.411
They have about fifty dogs.

780
00:43:34.542 --> 00:43:35.543
They train them.

781
00:43:35.673 --> 00:43:37.196
- Fifty?
- Yeah.


782
00:43:38.850 --> 00:43:40.591
It's the best way to travel.

783
00:43:40.722 --> 00:43:43.420
Yup. It sure is.

784
00:43:45.901 --> 00:43:47.685
Your best trail is over here.

785
00:43:47.816 --> 00:43:49.382
You just have to
watch for a few turns.


786
00:43:49.513 --> 00:43:51.341
I am here.

787
00:43:51.471 --> 00:43:52.995
You want to head all
the way down here


788
00:43:53.082 --> 00:43:55.345
to where the path opens.

789
00:43:55.519 --> 00:43:58.609
Now to cross the pass
and there's the cabin.


790
00:43:58.740 --> 00:43:59.958
Just over the river.

791
00:44:00.089 --> 00:44:01.307
So it's not too far?

792
00:44:01.394 --> 00:44:02.526
Not too far at all.

793
00:44:02.744 --> 00:44:05.703
Good for the pups.
They need a good run.


794
00:44:05.834 --> 00:44:08.010
Thank you for
trusting me with them.


795
00:44:08.097 --> 00:44:10.360
I'll have them back
before the storm sets in.


796
00:44:10.490 --> 00:44:11.796
You're welcome.

797
00:44:18.586 --> 00:44:19.630
Hike!

798
00:44:41.783 --> 00:44:43.785
I just don't know

799
00:44:43.872 --> 00:44:45.700
if Jessica has the
grit she'll need


800
00:44:45.830 --> 00:44:47.658
to be in a relationship
with Buck.


801
00:44:47.789 --> 00:44:49.268
You saw how upset she was when

802
00:44:49.399 --> 00:44:52.794
he had to leave at Thanksgiving?

803
00:44:52.924 --> 00:44:55.666
Seems more like love to me.

804
00:44:55.753 --> 00:44:57.625
I don't understand

805
00:44:57.755 --> 00:45:01.106
not being with your
family over the holidays.


806
00:45:01.193 --> 00:45:03.456
I mean, does she come
from a solid family?


807
00:45:03.631 --> 00:45:05.110
Yes.

808
00:45:05.241 --> 00:45:08.157
They just celebrate
differently, is all.


809
00:45:08.287 --> 00:45:10.594
Buck says she speaks to
her Mom, Dad and brother


810
00:45:10.725 --> 00:45:12.117
almost every day.

811
00:45:12.248 --> 00:45:15.425
They're artists.
They travel around a lot.


812
00:45:15.512 --> 00:45:19.124
Just a little less
traditional than us, is all.


813
00:45:19.211 --> 00:45:23.476
Well it's fine that not
every family is the same,


814
00:45:23.607 --> 00:45:27.785
as long as she's a
good fit with ours.


815
00:45:27.872 --> 00:45:32.964
Aunt Janine, I know this
time of year is hard for you


816
00:45:33.095 --> 00:45:35.619
and you're missing Uncle Walt.

817
00:45:35.706 --> 00:45:37.684
But remember how he'd always
make room at the table


818
00:45:37.708 --> 00:45:39.797
for others?

819
00:45:39.884 --> 00:45:43.714
If he hadn't done that for
me, I wouldn't be here.


820
00:45:47.762 --> 00:45:50.895
- Oh! Wait a minute.

821
00:45:51.026 --> 00:45:52.375
I've got one!

822
00:45:56.814 --> 00:45:58.468
Wait a minute.

823
00:45:59.904 --> 00:46:02.167
Two! Greedy grinches!

824
00:46:02.254 --> 00:46:03.168
Amara!

825
00:46:03.255 --> 00:46:04.256
I'm on it.

826
00:46:11.046 --> 00:46:12.438
Whoa!

827
00:46:24.668 --> 00:46:26.626
Okay guys.

828
00:46:26.714 --> 00:46:28.759
Good job, guys. Good job.

829
00:47:16.067 --> 00:47:19.157
Stop right there!

830
00:47:19.288 --> 00:47:21.899
Back away from the tree!

831
00:47:23.509 --> 00:47:25.816
Do you have a permit
to cut this tree down?


832
00:47:25.947 --> 00:47:27.992
What's a permit?

833
00:47:29.646 --> 00:47:31.039
Come with me.

834
00:47:35.086 --> 00:47:36.435
Who sent you?

835
00:47:36.566 --> 00:47:37.741
No one.

836
00:47:38.133 --> 00:47:40.570
Stealing trees from the
Wayne National Forest


837
00:47:40.700 --> 00:47:43.921
to sell at Christmas
is not allowed.


838
00:47:44.052 --> 00:47:45.531
Are we in trouble?

839
00:47:45.705 --> 00:47:47.272
Oh, I'd say so.

840
00:47:47.403 --> 00:47:48.883
Please, ma'am, you
can't tell our Mom.


841
00:47:48.970 --> 00:47:51.929
I can. And I will.

842
00:47:52.016 --> 00:47:53.322
They're just kids.

843
00:47:53.713 --> 00:47:55.517
Then I think you're the
perfect age to learn about


844
00:47:55.541 --> 00:47:57.587
the consequences
of your actions.


845
00:47:57.717 --> 00:47:59.241
Don't you think?

846
00:48:03.245 --> 00:48:04.899
Ah, good job guys.

847
00:48:05.987 --> 00:48:07.597
Good job.

848
00:48:09.033 --> 00:48:10.295
I got to figure out where I am.

849
00:48:14.299 --> 00:48:15.605
Okay...

850
00:48:18.869 --> 00:48:21.350
We're here.

851
00:48:21.437 --> 00:48:24.222
We're close.
We have to be close.


852
00:48:38.541 --> 00:48:40.760
Okay, guys.

853
00:48:40.848 --> 00:48:42.980
Don't even think about
going anywhere this time.


854
00:48:59.736 --> 00:49:02.695
How often are you still
having PTSD episodes?


855
00:49:05.655 --> 00:49:07.787
Not as much anymore.

856
00:49:07.962 --> 00:49:09.920
Not since I met Jess.

857
00:49:11.879 --> 00:49:14.142
I'm seeing someone about it.

858
00:49:14.229 --> 00:49:16.013
Sleeping better too.

859
00:49:17.145 --> 00:49:19.451
What about Roma?

860
00:49:19.625 --> 00:49:21.714
What about her?

861
00:49:21.845 --> 00:49:24.152
How has she transitioned
back to civilian life?


862
00:49:25.849 --> 00:49:28.939
Did she ever remarry?

863
00:49:29.070 --> 00:49:31.028
Re-what?

864
00:49:31.159 --> 00:49:34.640
Oh. Sorry. I...

865
00:49:34.814 --> 00:49:37.948
Meg. Spit it out.

866
00:49:38.079 --> 00:49:40.342
I don't think it was official.

867
00:49:40.429 --> 00:49:42.300
It was just a private
ceremony at the base.


868
00:49:42.431 --> 00:49:45.173
I thought you knew.

869
00:49:45.303 --> 00:49:49.568
Roma is definitely not married.

870
00:49:49.742 --> 00:49:51.788
Well no.

871
00:49:51.919 --> 00:49:54.791
He went missing on his tour.

872
00:49:54.922 --> 00:49:57.272
He never made it back home.

873
00:50:01.754 --> 00:50:04.018
She never said anything.

874
00:50:11.721 --> 00:50:15.290
We've all been trained to
set our emotions aside.


875
00:50:16.813 --> 00:50:19.163
That doesn't make it any easier.

876
00:50:21.339 --> 00:50:25.169
I know what it's like
to love somebody


877
00:50:25.256 --> 00:50:26.649
and to not have
them in your life.


878
00:50:34.613 --> 00:50:35.963
Meg, I...

879
00:50:36.267 --> 00:50:39.662
Would you reconsider moving
back to Avalon Pass?


880
00:50:44.232 --> 00:50:47.496
I think there's more for you in
the mountains than you think.


881
00:50:49.106 --> 00:50:50.325
Meg, I...

882
00:50:50.499 --> 00:50:52.196
Merry Christmas Buck!

883
00:50:52.283 --> 00:50:54.024
I hope I'm not
interrupting anything?


884
00:50:54.155 --> 00:50:56.244
Jess!

885
00:50:56.331 --> 00:50:58.333
What are you doing here?

886
00:50:58.463 --> 00:50:59.682
Why aren't you in your car?

887
00:50:59.812 --> 00:51:02.206
Well, my car conked out.

888
00:51:02.337 --> 00:51:04.034
So I left it with a mechanic.

889
00:51:04.165 --> 00:51:06.167
Really nice guy.
His name is Bob.


890
00:51:06.341 --> 00:51:08.125
I borrowed his dog
sled so I could


891
00:51:08.212 --> 00:51:12.564
go on a romantic Christmas
getaway with my boyfriend.


892
00:51:12.651 --> 00:51:14.262
Hey, I'm Meg.

893
00:51:16.090 --> 00:51:18.831
What brings you to
these snowy parts, Meg?


894
00:51:18.962 --> 00:51:21.008
I was... I was just
trying to show Buck


895
00:51:21.138 --> 00:51:22.618
a shortcut through
the backwoods.


896
00:51:22.792 --> 00:51:24.592
And then... It's actually
quite a funny story.


897
00:51:24.620 --> 00:51:26.100
We were racing
through the forest


898
00:51:26.230 --> 00:51:27.797
and we had a bit of an accident.

899
00:51:27.927 --> 00:51:30.278
And then... It was pretty
thrilling, though, wasn't it.


900
00:51:30.408 --> 00:51:32.608
Anyway, then we had to double
on my snowmobile to get...


901
00:51:33.977 --> 00:51:35.413
Jess! Jess!

902
00:51:37.067 --> 00:51:38.590
What?

903
00:51:42.203 --> 00:51:43.203
Jess.

904
00:51:44.988 --> 00:51:45.858
Jess, where are you going?

905
00:51:45.989 --> 00:51:47.208
Home.

906
00:51:47.382 --> 00:51:48.731
I thought your car
needed repairs.


907
00:51:48.905 --> 00:51:49.905
Yeah, it does!

908
00:51:51.821 --> 00:51:53.692
From the Santa parade
than watch you have lunch


909
00:51:53.823 --> 00:51:54.954
all cozy with Meg.

910
00:51:55.129 --> 00:51:56.869
Nothing is going on!

911
00:51:57.000 --> 00:51:58.349
I was coming to see you.

912
00:51:58.480 --> 00:51:59.674
Meg was just helping
me get there faster.


913
00:51:59.698 --> 00:52:01.526
And then I hit this log...

914
00:52:02.919 --> 00:52:05.182
Jess, please.

915
00:52:05.313 --> 00:52:06.923
We haven't seen
each other in weeks!


916
00:52:07.054 --> 00:52:08.707
And I missed you.

917
00:52:08.838 --> 00:52:11.536
I didn't want things
to start off this way.


918
00:52:11.667 --> 00:52:14.061
Me neither.

919
00:52:14.191 --> 00:52:16.759
We're off to a bumpy start, but,

920
00:52:16.889 --> 00:52:21.155
the cabin, it's going
to be nice. Okay?


921
00:52:21.285 --> 00:52:26.638
You know, all I wanted was just
to spend a few hours with you.


922
00:52:26.769 --> 00:52:29.902
No work, no rocks, no agenda.

923
00:52:30.077 --> 00:52:32.644
No other people. You know?

924
00:52:32.775 --> 00:52:34.864
I do.

925
00:52:34.951 --> 00:52:38.476
So when we get to the cabin,
Meg is going to leave and


926
00:52:38.650 --> 00:52:40.130
it's just going to
be just you and me.


927
00:52:40.261 --> 00:52:42.437
Meg is coming to the cabin?

928
00:52:42.611 --> 00:52:44.091
Your head is full
of jingle bells


929
00:52:44.178 --> 00:52:45.744
if you think that's happening.

930
00:52:47.094 --> 00:52:48.182
Buck!

931
00:52:49.183 --> 00:52:50.793
Meg?

932
00:52:52.534 --> 00:52:54.231
Here! Bring your pack!

933
00:53:01.369 --> 00:53:02.674
What's going on?

934
00:53:02.805 --> 00:53:04.739
I was taking him down to
get a drink by the river.


935
00:53:04.763 --> 00:53:06.765
And the poor guy stepped
right into that fox trap.


936
00:53:06.896 --> 00:53:09.855
Meg, antiseptic, gauze, water.

937
00:53:09.942 --> 00:53:11.422
They're in the bag.

938
00:53:11.553 --> 00:53:12.336
Jessica, hold him by
the shoulders. Steady.


939
00:53:12.467 --> 00:53:14.033
So he can't bite himself or us.

940
00:53:14.164 --> 00:53:15.164
I've got him.

941
00:53:44.281 --> 00:53:46.109
It's okay. I got him.

942
00:53:46.196 --> 00:53:47.545
- I'll be right by.
- Okay.


943
00:53:50.853 --> 00:53:52.855
I shouldn't have
taken him that way.


944
00:53:52.942 --> 00:53:54.502
I shouldn't have taken
him to the river.


945
00:53:54.596 --> 00:53:56.902
I could've made a few trips
and just brought him water.


946
00:53:57.076 --> 00:53:58.716
I could of brought all
four of them water.


947
00:54:01.211 --> 00:54:02.734
I'm so sorry.

948
00:54:02.865 --> 00:54:05.955
It's not on you.
It's not your fault.


949
00:54:06.085 --> 00:54:07.783
The trap is old.

950
00:54:07.957 --> 00:54:09.717
It looks like it's been
there for a long time.


951
00:54:09.741 --> 00:54:12.004
His wounds aren't that deep.

952
00:54:12.135 --> 00:54:13.963
It's going to be okay.

953
00:54:18.924 --> 00:54:21.536
Meg. Listen.

954
00:54:24.669 --> 00:54:28.630
I need you to know how
important Jess is to me.


955
00:54:28.760 --> 00:54:31.937
I care about her a lot.

956
00:54:32.111 --> 00:54:35.724
More than I've cared
about anyone before.


957
00:54:38.379 --> 00:54:40.816
More than you care about me?

958
00:54:43.558 --> 00:54:47.431
We make a great team.

959
00:54:47.518 --> 00:54:49.038
We wouldn't have been
friends this long


960
00:54:49.085 --> 00:54:51.261
if we weren't honest
with each other.


961
00:54:51.348 --> 00:54:54.482
- Yeah?
- Yeah.


962
00:54:54.612 --> 00:54:57.746
I can see how you
feel about Jessica.


963
00:54:57.876 --> 00:55:00.270
I saw the way that
you looked at her.


964
00:55:02.490 --> 00:55:05.014
You should tell her.

965
00:55:05.101 --> 00:55:08.278
She knows how I feel.

966
00:55:08.409 --> 00:55:10.324
She drove through a blizzard

967
00:55:10.454 --> 00:55:12.151
and rode a dog sled
to get to you.


968
00:55:12.326 --> 00:55:13.631
You should tell her.

969
00:55:16.417 --> 00:55:17.809
Okay.

970
00:55:23.815 --> 00:55:26.949
Okay, seriously, this is a lot.

971
00:55:27.079 --> 00:55:30.213
I already have
a best friend. So...

988
00:56:54.384 --> 00:56:56.081
Thanks, Charlie.

989
00:57:02.349 --> 00:57:04.152
Are you sure you're going
to okay with these guys?


990
00:57:04.176 --> 00:57:07.745
Thanks. I got this.

991
00:57:07.876 --> 00:57:09.506
Why don't you just come
with us to the cabin?


992
00:57:09.530 --> 00:57:11.662
We can all go back together.

993
00:57:11.793 --> 00:57:15.013
I've got to get this little
guy some medical attention.


994
00:57:15.100 --> 00:57:17.146
And then,

995
00:57:17.276 --> 00:57:20.715
I'm going to have Santa Bob
make me a giant hot chocolate.


996
00:57:20.802 --> 00:57:22.257
He actually makes
his own marshmallows.


997
00:57:22.281 --> 00:57:23.326
Can you believe it?

998
00:57:23.457 --> 00:57:25.807
Merry Christmas, Meg.

999
00:57:25.937 --> 00:57:27.722
Merry Christmas, Jessica.

1000
00:57:29.550 --> 00:57:30.768
Be safe.

1001
00:57:33.292 --> 00:57:34.292
Hike!

1002
00:57:35.425 --> 00:57:36.905
Be safe!

1003
00:57:42.911 --> 00:57:45.740
You were pretty
amazing back there.


1004
00:57:45.870 --> 00:57:48.177
You're good at what you do.

1005
00:57:48.307 --> 00:57:53.051
Rescuing people while being
all handsome and brave.


1006
00:57:53.182 --> 00:57:54.401
Really?

1007
00:57:54.531 --> 00:57:55.619
Yeah.

1008
00:57:57.316 --> 00:58:00.668
Look, I'm really
sorry about all that.


1009
00:58:00.798 --> 00:58:03.758
She is really just
a good friend.


1010
00:58:03.845 --> 00:58:07.457
I can't help how 'handsome and
brave' I am to other people.


1011
00:58:07.588 --> 00:58:08.937
Oh, please.

1012
00:58:15.334 --> 00:58:16.814
We'd better get going.

1013
00:58:16.945 --> 00:58:19.382
I don't like the
look of the sky.


1014
00:58:19.513 --> 00:58:21.993
Looks like the storm's moving
in faster than we thought.


1015
00:58:22.080 --> 00:58:24.343
The cabin is just on the
other side of the pass.


1016
00:58:24.474 --> 00:58:25.954
We'll be fine.

1017
00:58:26.084 --> 00:58:27.869
Right.

1018
00:58:27.956 --> 00:58:30.045
In just a couple of hours

1019
00:58:30.175 --> 00:58:32.221
and we'll be curled
up by a fireplace.


1020
00:58:32.395 --> 00:58:34.571
Visibility is getting worse.
Temperature is dropping.


1021
00:58:34.745 --> 00:58:37.139
And we're losing daylight.

1022
00:58:37.269 --> 00:58:39.291
Three worst-case scenarios,
all actually happening...


1023
00:58:39.315 --> 00:58:40.664
Right now.

1024
00:58:43.537 --> 00:58:44.538
Did you hear that?

1025
00:58:53.198 --> 00:58:54.678
Are those what I think they are?

1026
00:58:59.074 --> 00:59:00.815
Wolf tracks.

1027
00:59:00.945 --> 00:59:02.730
Great.

1028
00:59:02.817 --> 00:59:04.645
Welcome to Howler's Bay.

1029
00:59:22.576 --> 00:59:24.055
Like this?

1030
00:59:24.186 --> 00:59:25.622
That's it!

1031
00:59:25.709 --> 00:59:27.406
And it you want,
you can eat some.


1032
00:59:27.581 --> 00:59:29.539
That's the fun part!

1033
00:59:29.670 --> 00:59:34.022
When you're finished you can
take it home for your tree.


1034
00:59:34.196 --> 00:59:36.459
We don't have a tree this year.

1035
00:59:36.633 --> 00:59:38.722
Mom said we can't afford it.

1036
00:59:38.809 --> 00:59:40.898
That's right.

1037
00:59:41.029 --> 00:59:42.572
We wanted to surprise her
with one for Christmas


1038
00:59:42.596 --> 00:59:44.815
to make her happy.

1039
00:59:44.946 --> 00:59:47.209
She's been sad?

1040
00:59:48.515 --> 00:59:50.342
That's thoughtful of you.

1041
00:59:52.083 --> 00:59:53.563
Hey, can you make me one?

1042
00:59:53.694 --> 00:59:55.130
I'll be right back.

1043
00:59:56.871 --> 00:59:59.438
Aunt Janine, they weren't
taking the tree to sell it.


1044
00:59:59.526 --> 01:00:02.050
Sounds like they're having
a hard time at home.


1045
01:00:02.224 --> 01:00:05.575
Well that's still no reason
to resort to petty crime.


1046
01:00:05.706 --> 01:00:07.666
Behavior like this would
never have been tolerated


1047
01:00:07.751 --> 01:00:09.100
when I was a Junior Ranger.

1048
01:00:09.274 --> 01:00:11.450
I know. We have to
protect the forest.


1049
01:00:12.843 --> 01:00:13.963
Oh I think their Mom's here.

1050
01:00:15.106 --> 01:00:17.282
Sorry, I got here
as soon as I could.


1051
01:00:17.413 --> 01:00:18.413
Not to worry.

1052
01:00:21.330 --> 01:00:23.767
They were stealing a tree?
Really?


1053
01:00:25.508 --> 01:00:26.988
I'm sorry.

1054
01:00:27.075 --> 01:00:29.294
My kids are good kids.

1055
01:00:29.425 --> 01:00:31.296
I just haven't been able
to keep them in line


1056
01:00:31.470 --> 01:00:33.995
and do everything
without James being here.


1057
01:00:34.125 --> 01:00:35.779
James is your husband?

1058
01:00:35.910 --> 01:00:39.435
Yeah. He's a petroleum engineer.

1059
01:00:39.566 --> 01:00:41.872
He's away on an oil
rig for six months.


1060
01:00:42.003 --> 01:00:44.788
I worry about him.

1061
01:00:44.875 --> 01:00:47.791
It's hard to celebrate
when he's gone.


1062
01:00:49.445 --> 01:00:51.012
If you were to come
to the bakery,


1063
01:00:51.099 --> 01:00:53.014
I'd be more than happy
to make this up to you


1064
01:00:53.144 --> 01:00:55.538
with some fresh cinnamon
rolls for Christmas?


1065
01:00:55.669 --> 01:00:57.496
Mom!

1066
01:00:57.627 --> 01:00:59.455
Hi sweetheart!

1067
01:00:59.586 --> 01:01:01.588
I'm sorry, Mom.

1068
01:01:01.718 --> 01:01:03.677
Are we in trouble?

1069
01:01:03.807 --> 01:01:05.089
We just wanted you
to have a tree.


1070
01:01:05.113 --> 01:01:06.505
Can we go home now?

1071
01:01:06.680 --> 01:01:08.812
Rachel, Marcus...

1072
01:01:08.899 --> 01:01:10.901
I'm afraid you can't
leave just yet.


1073
01:01:11.032 --> 01:01:12.860
I expect you to make this right.

1074
01:01:32.706 --> 01:01:34.446
Are we out of gas?

1075
01:01:34.577 --> 01:01:35.577
That's impossible.

1076
01:01:36.797 --> 01:01:38.189
The gauge says full.

1077
01:01:54.031 --> 01:01:56.643
I guess the gauge is broken.

1078
01:01:56.817 --> 01:01:59.210
Great.

1079
01:01:59.341 --> 01:02:01.648
Well...

1080
01:02:01.778 --> 01:02:04.085
How far is the cabin from here?

1081
01:02:04.172 --> 01:02:06.609
Just across the river.

1082
01:02:06.740 --> 01:02:08.393
Are you up for a hike?

1083
01:02:08.567 --> 01:02:10.091
Yeah. Let's do it.

1084
01:02:22.277 --> 01:02:24.322
There you go.

1085
01:02:24.453 --> 01:02:26.020
Go ahead.

1086
01:02:28.457 --> 01:02:32.461
So these decorations
need to find a new home.


1087
01:02:32.591 --> 01:02:34.724
On your tree.

1088
01:02:34.855 --> 01:02:37.379
The one you didn't cut down.

1089
01:02:38.772 --> 01:02:39.772
Thanks, Ms Thompson.

1090
01:02:39.816 --> 01:02:40.948
Can we go decorate it now?

1091
01:02:41.078 --> 01:02:41.949
Off you go.

1092
01:02:42.079 --> 01:02:42.906
Follow me.

1093
01:02:43.037 --> 01:02:43.907
Thank you!

1094
01:02:44.038 --> 01:02:45.779
You're welcome.

1095
01:02:45.909 --> 01:02:48.433
Thank you for making them happy.

1096
01:02:48.520 --> 01:02:50.131
You know, the Rangers
and I could always


1097
01:02:50.261 --> 01:02:52.220
use help in the forest.

1098
01:02:52.394 --> 01:02:54.875
Maybe your kids would like
to join the Junior Rangers?


1099
01:02:57.529 --> 01:02:58.966
They would love that.

1100
01:03:01.446 --> 01:03:02.534
Merry Christmas.

1101
01:03:03.971 --> 01:03:05.233
Merry Christmas.

1102
01:03:09.454 --> 01:03:10.454
Go on!

1103
01:03:17.071 --> 01:03:19.029
Is that my Father's compass?

1104
01:03:19.203 --> 01:03:21.640
Yeah. Roma gave it to me.

1105
01:03:21.771 --> 01:03:23.033
For our trip.

1106
01:03:23.207 --> 01:03:25.035
She did?

1107
01:03:25.166 --> 01:03:26.820
She must like you.

1108
01:03:26.994 --> 01:03:29.126
Yeah, I like her too.

1109
01:03:29.213 --> 01:03:30.780
She's actually watching
Charlie for me.


1110
01:03:30.911 --> 01:03:32.869
Roma is dog sitting?

1111
01:03:32.956 --> 01:03:36.394
Wow. She must really like you.

1112
01:03:36.481 --> 01:03:39.484
Well, she kind of seemed
happy to have some company.


1113
01:03:39.615 --> 01:03:42.836
Although, she's more
of a cat person.


1114
01:03:44.751 --> 01:03:46.578
Roma to Charlie...

1115
01:03:46.709 --> 01:03:49.799
Roma to Charlie,
requesting permission to land.


1116
01:03:49.973 --> 01:03:52.541
There you go.

1117
01:03:52.671 --> 01:03:54.499
Of course I brought
a treat for you.


1118
01:03:54.630 --> 01:03:57.241
I am your Santa.

1119
01:03:57.372 --> 01:03:59.678
Just don't tell Jessica I'm
giving you treats, okay?


1120
01:03:59.809 --> 01:04:01.649
Otherwise she won't let
me dog sit you anymore.


1121
01:04:03.073 --> 01:04:04.205
Where is she?

1122
01:04:04.335 --> 01:04:05.655
We should be getting
ready by now.


1123
01:04:08.339 --> 01:04:09.514
Pretty quiet up there.

1124
01:04:11.386 --> 01:04:13.780
You're way too
quiet for Jessica.


1125
01:04:13.910 --> 01:04:15.694
No I'm not.

1126
01:04:15.825 --> 01:04:18.088
Yes you are.

1127
01:04:18.219 --> 01:04:20.438
You talk endlessly
when you're excited.


1128
01:04:20.569 --> 01:04:23.137
You laugh when you're nervous.

1129
01:04:23.224 --> 01:04:25.792
But you laugh when you try
not to laugh at your own joke


1130
01:04:25.922 --> 01:04:29.143
and you are quiet when
you're over thinking.


1131
01:04:30.666 --> 01:04:32.165
You know you don't know
everything about me,


1132
01:04:32.189 --> 01:04:34.191
Buck Thompson.

1133
01:04:34.365 --> 01:04:36.324
We've only been
dating a few months.


1134
01:04:36.454 --> 01:04:39.022
But I like everything
I've learned about you.


1135
01:04:39.153 --> 01:04:40.850
Especially your rock puns.

1136
01:04:42.373 --> 01:04:46.334
Well. I've missed you.

1137
01:04:46.464 --> 01:04:49.380
I realized all I wanted to
do was just be with you.


1138
01:04:49.511 --> 01:04:51.556
And you were up there with Meg,

1139
01:04:51.687 --> 01:04:54.472
rescuing people and
saving people's lives,


1140
01:04:54.603 --> 01:04:56.648
and making the world
a better place and...


1141
01:04:56.779 --> 01:04:59.521
That's just it, Jess.

1142
01:04:59.651 --> 01:05:02.176
You make the world so much
better than I ever could.


1143
01:05:02.306 --> 01:05:04.265
Just by being you.

1144
01:05:09.052 --> 01:05:10.358
Get back.

1145
01:05:22.109 --> 01:05:24.415
Yeah. I know...

1146
01:05:24.546 --> 01:05:26.243
Scary foxes.

1147
01:05:28.637 --> 01:05:32.249
Can we please just shake
this whole Meg thing off?


1148
01:05:33.990 --> 01:05:35.513
I can't control how she feels.

1149
01:05:35.600 --> 01:05:37.602
All I can control is how I feel.

1150
01:05:37.733 --> 01:05:41.128
And I really want to spend
Christmas with my girlfriend.


1151
01:05:47.134 --> 01:05:48.134
Better?

1152
01:05:48.222 --> 01:05:49.701
Much. Thank you.

1153
01:05:52.095 --> 01:05:54.054
I know how I feel
about you, too.


1154
01:05:55.316 --> 01:05:57.971
And the jumping helped.

1155
01:05:58.101 --> 01:06:00.234
A little.

1156
01:06:00.408 --> 01:06:02.540
I can kind of feel
my toes again.


1157
01:06:02.714 --> 01:06:04.107
Sort of.

1158
01:06:08.546 --> 01:06:10.244
We can cross through here.

1159
01:06:10.418 --> 01:06:11.698
The river's just over that hill.

1160
01:06:13.203 --> 01:06:16.119
Well, I read the map too and...

1161
01:06:17.425 --> 01:06:18.905
It's not going to
take much longer


1162
01:06:18.992 --> 01:06:22.082
if we stick to the safer route.

1163
01:06:24.084 --> 01:06:25.781
Okay.

1164
01:06:25.912 --> 01:06:27.304
You lead the way.

1165
01:06:31.395 --> 01:06:37.227
♪

1166
01:06:37.314 --> 01:06:45.314
♪

1167
01:06:47.324 --> 01:06:51.633
♪

1168
01:06:51.720 --> 01:06:54.549
You think Dad would like this?

1169
01:06:54.679 --> 01:06:57.465
How could he not?

1170
01:06:57.552 --> 01:06:59.684
Look how beautiful it is!

1171
01:06:59.858 --> 01:07:02.339
Yeah. He'd think it was perfect.

1172
01:07:04.211 --> 01:07:07.866
Well, you can come back next
year and decorate it again.


1173
01:07:07.954 --> 01:07:11.044
Plus everyone who comes
to the woods can see it.


1174
01:07:11.218 --> 01:07:13.176
It's beautiful!

1175
01:07:15.178 --> 01:07:16.178
Thank you, Amara.

1176
01:07:17.267 --> 01:07:18.573
Hello!

1177
01:07:18.703 --> 01:07:22.664
Hi Charlie! Merry Christmas Eve!

1178
01:07:22.751 --> 01:07:23.926
Hello to you too.

1179
01:07:24.057 --> 01:07:25.754
Hi.

1180
01:07:25.884 --> 01:07:28.670
So how're your first
dog adventures going?


1181
01:07:28.800 --> 01:07:30.802
Oh, I'd say we had
a really good time.


1182
01:07:30.933 --> 01:07:33.022
Didn't we? Yes we did.

1183
01:07:33.153 --> 01:07:36.243
Oh! Didn't think you were
much of a dog person.


1184
01:07:36.373 --> 01:07:39.768
I'd say I'm more of
a Charlie person.


1185
01:07:39.855 --> 01:07:41.074
You guys ready to go?

1186
01:07:41.204 --> 01:07:42.486
Yeah, I just need
to grab my coat.


1187
01:07:42.510 --> 01:07:44.338
And, of course, his squeaky toy.

1188
01:07:44.468 --> 01:07:45.468
Come on!

1189
01:07:53.782 --> 01:07:55.262
Hey Aunt Janine.

1190
01:07:55.392 --> 01:07:57.220
Roma and I are
getting ready to go.


1191
01:07:57.307 --> 01:08:00.006
Hey. Listen.
Have you heard from Buck?


1192
01:08:00.136 --> 01:08:03.183
I'd like my son here for
church on Christmas Eve.


1193
01:08:03.270 --> 01:08:05.794
Jessica promised she'd call
when she gets to the cabin.


1194
01:08:07.143 --> 01:08:09.276
They're just catching up.

1195
01:08:09.450 --> 01:08:12.192
Right. Well, okay.

1196
01:08:12.366 --> 01:08:13.932
She knows to drive
him back in time


1197
01:08:14.063 --> 01:08:16.196
for our family celebrations.

1198
01:08:16.283 --> 01:08:17.956
So if that doesn't earn
the girl some serious points


1199
01:08:17.980 --> 01:08:20.243
in your books, I
don't know what will.


1200
01:08:20.374 --> 01:08:22.550
Okay. So where on
earth are they?


1201
01:08:22.680 --> 01:08:24.769
I don't know.

1202
01:08:24.943 --> 01:08:26.356
But Buck wouldn't
deviate from the plan.


1203
01:08:26.380 --> 01:08:27.859
They must be close.

1204
01:08:27.946 --> 01:08:29.731
Right.

1205
01:08:29.905 --> 01:08:31.274
Well, I suppose if anyone could
make it through the wilds,


1206
01:08:31.298 --> 01:08:32.951
it's those two.

1207
01:08:33.039 --> 01:08:36.825
You know, singing
might help warm us up.


1208
01:08:36.955 --> 01:08:38.305
No chance.

1209
01:08:53.407 --> 01:08:54.973
It's okay.

1210
01:08:55.148 --> 01:08:57.933
It's okay. It's okay.

1211
01:09:04.809 --> 01:09:05.810
It's that sound.

1212
01:09:08.117 --> 01:09:09.901
The howling.

1213
01:09:10.032 --> 01:09:13.253
I know. It's haunting.

1214
01:09:16.082 --> 01:09:17.518
We're getting close.

1215
01:09:17.648 --> 01:09:20.042
I can hear the river.

1216
01:09:20.173 --> 01:09:22.107
It's going to be dangerous, but
it's the only way to get home.


1217
01:09:22.131 --> 01:09:23.131
Hey.

1218
01:09:24.742 --> 01:09:26.831
I know. We need to get home.

1219
01:09:29.617 --> 01:09:30.617
Thank you.

1220
01:09:32.663 --> 01:09:35.753
A guy could really
freeze up out here.


1221
01:09:35.840 --> 01:09:38.278
Don't even joke about frostbite.

1222
01:09:39.844 --> 01:09:40.844
Come on.

1223
01:09:55.338 --> 01:09:57.253
The river sounds
like it's running fast.


1224
01:09:57.384 --> 01:09:58.820
It sounds dangerous.

1225
01:10:04.565 --> 01:10:05.957
The river looks
higher this year.


1226
01:10:06.088 --> 01:10:07.611
Well...

1227
01:10:07.785 --> 01:10:10.484
Looks like we're spending
Christmas in the wilds.


1228
01:10:10.614 --> 01:10:13.487
We either cross the river
or we sleep outside.


1229
01:10:16.011 --> 01:10:18.405
We have no idea
how deep that is.


1230
01:10:18.535 --> 01:10:19.884
What will kill us first?

1231
01:10:20.058 --> 01:10:22.322
The freezing cold
river or the current?


1232
01:10:25.586 --> 01:10:26.946
Let's find a
better place to cross.


1233
01:10:47.825 --> 01:10:49.958
The water's shallower here.

1234
01:10:50.088 --> 01:10:52.047
Even in the middle.

1235
01:10:52.178 --> 01:10:54.267
It should only go up
to about mid-thigh.


1236
01:10:54.397 --> 01:10:57.313
It's narrower here so it will
be quicker to get across.


1237
01:10:57.444 --> 01:10:58.880
It's easy.

1238
01:11:01.143 --> 01:11:03.232
We're not going to find
a better way to cross.


1239
01:11:03.363 --> 01:11:05.713
The current only gets stronger
the further down we go.


1240
01:11:12.067 --> 01:11:14.765
I, I know.

1241
01:11:14.896 --> 01:11:18.029
I'm not going to let
anything happen to you.


1242
01:11:18.204 --> 01:11:19.335
Just think about that cabin

1243
01:11:19.422 --> 01:11:21.381
on the other side of that ridge.

1244
01:11:21.511 --> 01:11:23.600
A big warm fire that's
waiting for us.


1245
01:11:25.559 --> 01:11:27.387
You're making future plans now?

1246
01:11:27.517 --> 01:11:29.519
Jess, I need you to trust me.

1247
01:11:29.650 --> 01:11:32.566
We can do this. You and I.

1248
01:11:32.740 --> 01:11:34.307
Together.

1249
01:11:34.437 --> 01:11:36.309
Okay.

1250
01:11:36.439 --> 01:11:37.658
Okay.

1251
01:11:49.060 --> 01:11:51.149
Wait wait! I don't
think I can do this!


1252
01:11:51.324 --> 01:11:53.282
Jess, you keep going.

1253
01:11:53.413 --> 01:11:55.589
Quick, but steady.

1254
01:12:02.117 --> 01:12:03.684
Buck! Buck!

1255
01:12:42.200 --> 01:12:43.767
Buck!

1256
01:12:43.854 --> 01:12:44.854
Buck!

1257
01:13:28.725 --> 01:13:29.726
Come on! Come on!

1258
01:13:34.122 --> 01:13:36.082
We need to get your boots
and wet clothes off now!


1259
01:13:40.128 --> 01:13:41.390
Okay, I'm going to make a fire.

1260
01:13:41.521 --> 01:13:42.641
And call your Mom and Amara.

1261
01:14:24.651 --> 01:14:26.827
So, how do I look?

1262
01:14:28.698 --> 01:14:31.571
Very handsome and brave.
Festive.


1263
01:14:31.658 --> 01:14:33.094
Thank you.

1264
01:14:35.575 --> 01:14:37.403
Here. Let me take those.

1265
01:14:37.533 --> 01:14:38.534
Sit down.

1266
01:14:41.624 --> 01:14:43.800
Is the radio working this time?

1267
01:14:43.887 --> 01:14:47.151
Yeah. I radioed in
our position to Amara.


1268
01:14:47.238 --> 01:14:50.372
Your Mom was relieved
to hear we were okay.


1269
01:14:50.503 --> 01:14:54.289
Another hour, she would've
sent out the search party.


1270
01:14:54.376 --> 01:14:57.727
But, she did manage to save us
some of her homemade egg nog.


1271
01:14:57.858 --> 01:14:59.642
She's starting to like you.

1272
01:14:59.729 --> 01:15:03.167
Well, I am the beautiful,
courageous woman


1273
01:15:03.298 --> 01:15:05.779
who made it through the forest

1274
01:15:05.866 --> 01:15:08.346
and across that
river with her son.


1275
01:15:08.521 --> 01:15:10.436
Jess, Jess. Please.

1276
01:15:10.566 --> 01:15:12.916
I'm more likely to die of
blanket suffocation


1277
01:15:13.047 --> 01:15:14.701
than hypothermia at this point.

1278
01:15:14.875 --> 01:15:17.660
I promise, I'm good.

1279
01:15:17.747 --> 01:15:19.270
Just one more.

1280
01:15:21.621 --> 01:15:22.665
There.

1281
01:15:35.896 --> 01:15:37.941
You're looking better.

1282
01:15:38.072 --> 01:15:40.204
Blue lips weren't a
great look for you.


1283
01:15:40.335 --> 01:15:41.935
I'm going to remember
that for next time.


1284
01:15:44.557 --> 01:15:46.602
You know Buck, thank you

1285
01:15:46.733 --> 01:15:48.430
for getting us
across that river.


1286
01:15:48.561 --> 01:15:50.016
But I'd appreciate
it if you'd stop doing


1287
01:15:50.040 --> 01:15:52.129
such dangerous things.

1288
01:15:52.260 --> 01:15:54.392
I'm tired of having to save you!

1289
01:15:54.567 --> 01:15:57.047
- Oh really.
- Yeah!


1290
01:15:57.178 --> 01:16:00.703
Well, I think we saved
each other this time.


1291
01:16:04.359 --> 01:16:05.578
Come here.

1292
01:16:11.758 --> 01:16:14.412
Well, it looks like we get to
spend Christmas Eve together


1293
01:16:14.543 --> 01:16:17.067
after all.

1294
01:16:17.154 --> 01:16:18.155
I'm grateful.

1295
01:16:20.636 --> 01:16:21.898
Me too.

1296
01:16:23.117 --> 01:16:24.117
Hey Jess...

1297
01:16:28.296 --> 01:16:32.300
Ever since I got back
from Afghanistan,


1298
01:16:32.474 --> 01:16:37.174
I've been keeping the ones
I love at a distance.


1299
01:16:37.261 --> 01:16:39.133
Even you.

1300
01:16:41.265 --> 01:16:44.704
And I know that these last few
weeks have been difficult,


1301
01:16:44.791 --> 01:16:49.883
being separated, but if we
weren't away from each other,


1302
01:16:49.970 --> 01:16:55.845
I wouldn't have realized how
much I want that to change.


1303
01:16:55.976 --> 01:16:57.281
Forever.

1304
01:17:01.155 --> 01:17:02.765
I want you to have something.

1305
01:17:06.682 --> 01:17:08.292
My lucky rock.

1306
01:17:08.423 --> 01:17:11.034
It's just a stand in.

1307
01:17:11.165 --> 01:17:14.037
For now.

1308
01:17:14.168 --> 01:17:16.953
Until I can get you a
much more sparkly one.


1309
01:17:21.436 --> 01:17:24.308
Jessica Alaway.

1310
01:17:24.395 --> 01:17:28.269
I want to spend the rest
of my life with you.


1311
01:17:28.399 --> 01:17:30.053
Will you marry me?

1312
01:17:30.184 --> 01:17:32.969
Yes! Yes!

1313
01:17:40.760 --> 01:17:42.457
I love you, Jess.

1314
01:17:42.588 --> 01:17:43.937
I love you more.

1315
01:17:44.067 --> 01:17:45.939
Ah, that's not possible.

1316
01:17:49.029 --> 01:17:51.031
You do realize we have to

1317
01:17:51.161 --> 01:17:53.076
get home for Christmas
Eve dinner now.


1318
01:17:53.207 --> 01:17:54.445
Or Mom's going to kill us both.

1319
01:17:54.469 --> 01:17:55.775
Yeah, I know.

1320
01:18:16.360 --> 01:18:18.232
I can't believe I
have to do this again!


1321
01:18:20.756 --> 01:18:22.628
Admit it. You like it.

1322
01:18:22.758 --> 01:18:25.935
Wow! That is quite the outfit!
Very festive.


1323
01:18:26.109 --> 01:18:29.199
Yeah. It's keeping me warm.

1324
01:18:29.373 --> 01:18:30.853
I can see that.

1325
01:18:32.420 --> 01:18:35.075
Well, we have a
Christmas Eve to get to.


1326
01:18:35.205 --> 01:18:36.685
We cannot be late for service.

1327
01:18:38.078 --> 01:18:39.732
You're welcome for the rescue.

1328
01:18:39.862 --> 01:18:42.212
Rescue? That's not
what this was!


1329
01:18:42.343 --> 01:18:43.799
You just came in to
give me fashion advice.


1330
01:18:43.823 --> 01:18:44.867
Come on.

1331
01:18:47.565 --> 01:18:50.917
Thank you so much for
bringing him home in one piece.


1332
01:18:51.004 --> 01:18:52.919
I'm so glad to be here.

1333
01:18:53.093 --> 01:18:54.181
Me too.

1334
01:18:58.359 --> 01:18:59.795
Congratulations!

1335
01:18:59.926 --> 01:19:01.275
Thank you.

1336
01:19:01.405 --> 01:19:02.405
I'm proud of you.

1337
01:19:05.540 --> 01:19:07.629
A rock, though?

1338
01:19:07.760 --> 01:19:09.370
Yeah, it's a long story.

1339
01:19:09.457 --> 01:19:10.737
Maybe I'll tell
you another time.


1340
01:19:10.850 --> 01:19:11.938
Okay.

1341
01:19:14.418 --> 01:19:18.814
I know I didn't get you for
secret Santa this year,


1342
01:19:18.901 --> 01:19:21.599
but I did get you a gift.

1343
01:19:21.730 --> 01:19:23.819
What are you talking about?

1344
01:19:23.950 --> 01:19:26.213
I made some calls.

1345
01:19:26.343 --> 01:19:28.476
And we're going to find him.

1346
01:19:28.606 --> 01:19:31.087
Your missing soldier.

1347
01:19:35.439 --> 01:19:36.789
Thank you.

1348
01:19:42.098 --> 01:19:44.710
You know, it helps
to talk to somebody.


1349
01:19:44.797 --> 01:19:46.363
Take it from somebody who knows

1350
01:19:46.494 --> 01:19:50.541
how hard it is to
come home. Yeah.


1351
01:19:50.628 --> 01:19:53.196
Yeah.

1352
01:19:55.764 --> 01:19:58.288
Hello! A toast!

1353
01:19:58.419 --> 01:19:59.986
Yes!

1354
01:20:00.116 --> 01:20:01.552
Come gather around, kids.

1355
01:20:06.949 --> 01:20:10.170
Nothing formal. 
Nothing fancy.

1356
01:20:10.300 --> 01:20:14.957
I would just like to
make a toast to love...


1357
01:20:15.088 --> 01:20:17.786
And to family.

1358
01:20:17.917 --> 01:20:19.701
To Uncle Walt!

1359
01:20:19.832 --> 01:20:21.485
Cheers everybody.

1360
01:20:21.616 --> 01:20:26.969
Cheers.

1361
01:20:28.579 --> 01:20:29.579
Oops!

1362
01:20:30.973 --> 01:20:32.758
Buck!

1363
01:20:32.888 --> 01:20:34.324
Every year!

1364
01:20:37.632 --> 01:20:39.155
It's time to go!

1365
01:20:39.286 --> 01:20:40.896
- Oh goodness.
- It is!


1366
01:20:45.509 --> 01:20:47.598
You need a jacket.

1367
01:20:47.773 --> 01:20:50.340
I lost my in the river, Mom.

1368
01:20:50.427 --> 01:20:52.227
I'm just glad I didn't
lose you in that river.


1369
01:20:53.866 --> 01:20:55.781
Stand by.

1370
01:20:55.911 --> 01:20:57.130
Okay.

1371
01:21:02.657 --> 01:21:03.789
Dad's coat?

1372
01:21:03.919 --> 01:21:05.965
Yeah.

1373
01:21:06.095 --> 01:21:07.923
You need it now, honey.

1374
01:21:08.054 --> 01:21:09.620
This will keep you warm.

1375
01:21:11.318 --> 01:21:14.582
Oh my gosh! Look at this.

1376
01:21:14.712 --> 01:21:16.976
It fits you perfectly.

1377
01:21:26.028 --> 01:21:28.248
You look nice.

1378
01:21:28.378 --> 01:21:29.378
Thank you.

1379
01:21:30.293 --> 01:21:31.860
- Are you ready?
- Uh huh.


1380
01:21:33.209 --> 01:21:35.429
All right kids.
Jessica, after you.


1381
01:21:35.559 --> 01:21:36.909
Okay. Let's go.

1382
01:21:38.954 --> 01:21:40.303

Merry Christmas.

1410
01:24:02.837 --> 01:24:06.928
You know, this has been a
pretty great Christmas Eve.


1411
01:24:07.102 --> 01:24:10.497
You're the best present I
could have ever asked for.


1412
01:24:10.627 --> 01:24:13.065
You're mine too.

1413
01:24:13.152 --> 01:24:14.912
You know, I don't think
we could have planned


1414
01:24:15.023 --> 01:24:17.808
a better holiday if we tried.

1415
01:24:17.939 --> 01:24:22.378
Other than the blizzard,
extreme cold, and icy river.


1416
01:24:22.509 --> 01:24:24.032
The cabin was nice.

1417
01:24:24.163 --> 01:24:25.207
Yeah!

1418
01:24:28.210 --> 01:24:30.604
There's no meteor
shower tonight.


1419
01:24:30.734 --> 01:24:32.823
That's okay.

1420
01:24:32.910 --> 01:24:36.088
I think I've had enough of
the wonders of nature for now.


1421
01:24:36.262 --> 01:24:39.221
I am perfectly content

1422
01:24:39.352 --> 01:24:42.224
with a boring life
with my fiancé.


1423
01:24:42.311 --> 01:24:45.010
I think our life
together is going to be


1424
01:24:45.140 --> 01:24:47.577
anything but boring.

1425
01:24:47.751 --> 01:24:49.405
I think so too.
