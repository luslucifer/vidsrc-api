(dramatic music)
(curtain rustling)

00:00:41.746 --> 00:00:46.751
(birds chirping)
(wind howling)


6
00:00:51.255 --> 00:00:54.324
(soft dramatic tone)

00:01:02.332 --> 00:01:05.870

00:01:24.522 --> 00:01:27.792
(mellow hip-hop music)

10
00:01:36.199 --> 00:01:38.402
- You know what
this reminds me of?


11
00:01:38.435 --> 00:01:40.538
That joint you were supposed
to spark up two exits ago.


12
00:01:40.572 --> 00:01:42.674
- Ah, all right, all
right, all right!


13
00:01:42.707 --> 00:01:45.710
Just give me a second.

14
00:01:45.743 --> 00:01:47.845
- Come on, come on!

15
00:01:47.879 --> 00:01:51.148
(mellow hip-hop music)

16
00:01:56.588 --> 00:01:58.188
- What are you doin', man?

17
00:01:58.221 --> 00:01:59.456
Why you stoppin'?

18
00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.325
- I wanna see if
this guy needs help.


19
00:02:01.358 --> 00:02:03.061
- [Passenger] At 2 a.m.
in the middle of nowhere?


20
00:02:03.093 --> 00:02:04.729
- [Driver] Ah, you're just high.

21
00:02:04.762 --> 00:02:06.030
- I'm always high.

22
00:02:06.064 --> 00:02:07.364
What does that have
to do with anything?


23
00:02:07.397 --> 00:02:08.499
- You're paranoid, too.

24
00:02:09.667 --> 00:02:11.234
Don't touch anything.

25
00:02:11.268 --> 00:02:12.537
I'll be back in a second.

26
00:02:13.671 --> 00:02:17.341
(mellow hip-hop music)

27
00:02:17.374 --> 00:02:18.241
- If you're not back
in five minutes,


28
00:02:18.275 --> 00:02:19.309
I'm leaving you, man!

29
00:02:28.553 --> 00:02:30.153
I'm telling you, man,

30
00:02:30.187 --> 00:02:31.355
he's probably a killer.

31
00:02:34.358 --> 00:02:35.225
- Hey, there.

32
00:02:35.258 --> 00:02:36.894
You, uh, need a hand?

33
00:02:36.928 --> 00:02:37.962
- Oh, my gosh, yes!

34
00:02:37.996 --> 00:02:38.796
That would be great.

35
00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:40.064
Thank you.

36
00:02:40.098 --> 00:02:43.101
I am, I am not good
with cars. (laughs)


37
00:02:43.133 --> 00:02:46.436
- Uh, did you call anybody?

38
00:02:46.471 --> 00:02:47.505
- No service.

39
00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:51.241
(phone beeps)

40
00:02:51.274 --> 00:02:52.510
- Yeah, I got nothin' either.

41
00:02:52.543 --> 00:02:53.343
You mind if I take a look?

42
00:02:53.377 --> 00:02:54.912
- No, please!

43
00:02:54.946 --> 00:02:55.780
Thank you.

44
00:03:00.618 --> 00:03:02.587
(eerie music)

45
00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:03.821
Where you headed, um?

46
00:03:05.023 --> 00:03:06.289
- Hunter.

47
00:03:06.323 --> 00:03:07.925
We are headed up
to Camp Echo Lake.


48
00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:10.061
- The old Camp Pleasant Lake?

49
00:03:11.428 --> 00:03:13.665
- Yeah, new owners bought
it, the Rutherfords,


50
00:03:13.698 --> 00:03:16.366
and they're turning
it into a horror camp.


51
00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:18.803
(suspenseful music)

52
00:03:18.836 --> 00:03:19.637
- A what?

53
00:03:19.671 --> 00:03:20.805
- A horror camp.

54
00:03:20.838 --> 00:03:22.640
Adults pay good money to relive

55
00:03:22.674 --> 00:03:24.742
the legendary horror events.

56
00:03:24.776 --> 00:03:27.444
And this week's
theme, Camp of Terror.


57
00:03:27.478 --> 00:03:29.346
(dramatic music)

58
00:03:29.379 --> 00:03:30.748
- A camp of what?

59
00:03:30.782 --> 00:03:33.117
- It's the story of
the Meadows family,


60
00:03:33.151 --> 00:03:35.185
happened 20 years
ago this weekend.


61
00:03:36.921 --> 00:03:38.890
Camp of Terror is
what the news call it.


62
00:03:38.923 --> 00:03:41.191
John and Ruby Meadows
dropped their kids,


63
00:03:41.224 --> 00:03:43.260
Echo and Jasper,
off at the camp,


64
00:03:43.293 --> 00:03:46.097
and Echo was kidnapped.

65
00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:47.932
And they ended up
closin' the lake.


66
00:03:49.399 --> 00:03:50.400
To top it off,

67
00:03:51.602 --> 00:03:53.171
John and Ruby were
brutally murdered


68
00:03:53.203 --> 00:03:57.041
by some crazed maniac
on their way home.


69
00:03:57.075 --> 00:04:01.179
- Uh, um, what happened
to the little girl?


70
00:04:02.379 --> 00:04:03.748
- [Hunter] She was
never seen again.


71
00:04:05.415 --> 00:04:07.018
- And the little brother?

72
00:04:07.051 --> 00:04:08.285
- I don't know.

73
00:04:08.318 --> 00:04:10.021
I think he ended
up in foster care.


74
00:04:11.055 --> 00:04:12.724
So we were hired to come up

75
00:04:12.757 --> 00:04:14.759
and do the special
effects for the camp.


76
00:04:14.792 --> 00:04:15.827
- We?

77
00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:17.628
- Yeah, Adam, my
assistant and I.


78
00:04:17.662 --> 00:04:19.229
So he's back in the van.

79
00:04:19.262 --> 00:04:21.398
He's pretty sure
you're a serial killer.


80
00:04:21.431 --> 00:04:24.267
(motorist laughs)

81
00:04:25.803 --> 00:04:27.205
- Come on, come on, come on!

82
00:04:28.639 --> 00:04:30.475
(leaves rustling)

83
00:04:30.508 --> 00:04:31.943
What was that?

84
00:04:31.976 --> 00:04:33.678
- How many kills
do you have to do


85
00:04:34.746 --> 00:04:37.081
to be officially
labeled a serial killer?


86
00:04:37.115 --> 00:04:38.516
- What?

87
00:04:38.549 --> 00:04:42.053
(suspenseful music)

88
00:04:47.158 --> 00:04:47.959
- Don't worry,

89
00:04:47.992 --> 00:04:49.560
I'm not gonna kill you.

90
00:04:50.661 --> 00:04:51.461
- Okay.

91
00:04:51.496 --> 00:04:52.462
Good.

92
00:04:52.497 --> 00:04:55.900
(dark suspenseful music)

93
00:04:58.268 --> 00:05:00.303
(eerie music)

94
00:05:00.337 --> 00:05:01.506
(twigs snapping)

95
00:05:01.539 --> 00:05:02.940
- Who's there?
(skin squelching)


96
00:05:02.974 --> 00:05:03.775
- Ugh.

97
00:05:03.808 --> 00:05:07.111
(blood gushing)

98
00:05:07.145 --> 00:05:07.945
(body thuds)
(van alarm beeps)


99
00:05:07.979 --> 00:05:09.312
- What was that?

100
00:05:11.115 --> 00:05:12.382
Adam, goddammit.

101
00:05:12.415 --> 00:05:14.719
I told you not to
touch anything.


102
00:05:14.752 --> 00:05:17.188
- Hey, where you going, man?

103
00:05:17.221 --> 00:05:20.758
(dramatic music)

104
00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:24.028
What the fuck?

105
00:05:24.929 --> 00:05:27.865
(motorist screams)

106
00:05:32.036 --> 00:05:35.606
(upbeat suspenseful music)

107
00:05:42.613 --> 00:05:45.950
(train whistle blowing)

108
00:05:50.555 --> 00:05:54.292
(upbeat suspenseful music)

109
00:05:54.324 --> 00:05:57.094
(dramatic music)

110
00:06:00.798 --> 00:06:04.367
(upbeat suspenseful music)

111
00:06:17.481 --> 00:06:20.251
(swing creaking)

112
00:06:21.384 --> 00:06:25.623
(upbeat suspenseful
music continues)


113
00:06:41.371 --> 00:06:44.709
(train whistle blowing)

114
00:06:48.679 --> 00:06:51.782
(dark ominous music)

115
00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:11.702
(upbeat music)

116
00:07:12.870 --> 00:07:15.673
- Hello, and welcome
to Camp Pleasant Lake.


117
00:07:15.706 --> 00:07:16.941
- Hi there.
- Hey!


118
00:07:16.974 --> 00:07:19.610
- Hope you're all ready
for a weekend of terror!


119
00:07:19.644 --> 00:07:21.245
- I'm excited to see blood.

120
00:07:21.279 --> 00:07:23.147
- Glad to hear it.
- When's the terror start?


121
00:07:23.180 --> 00:07:24.447
- Relax, my man, soon enough.

122
00:07:24.482 --> 00:07:25.516
- Awesome!

123
00:07:25.549 --> 00:07:26.884
- Hey-
- How was your trip?


124
00:07:26.918 --> 00:07:27.718
- Not bad.

125
00:07:27.752 --> 00:07:28.753
Do you know where I can

126
00:07:28.786 --> 00:07:29.987
find the Rutherfords?
- Yeah.


127
00:07:30.021 --> 00:07:30.788
Hopefully, it's
better next time.


128
00:07:30.821 --> 00:07:31.756
I'm sorry to hear that.

129
00:07:31.789 --> 00:07:33.524
- Yeah, I have had better.

130
00:07:33.557 --> 00:07:34.859
- He was snorin' the whole trip.

131
00:07:34.892 --> 00:07:36.160
- Hey, do you know who I am?

132
00:07:36.193 --> 00:07:38.262
- No one cares, bro!
- Loser!


133
00:07:38.296 --> 00:07:41.365
- Look, I am puttin'
this in my report.


134
00:07:41.399 --> 00:07:42.867
- I've been waiting
for this all week.


135
00:07:42.900 --> 00:07:44.168
- Only a week?

136
00:07:44.201 --> 00:07:45.836
- Well, my wife's mad I came.

137
00:07:45.870 --> 00:07:47.204
(man scoffs)
- What?


138
00:07:47.238 --> 00:07:48.372
- She hates horror movies.

139
00:07:48.406 --> 00:07:49.640
- Oh, this ain't a movie, man.

140
00:07:49.674 --> 00:07:51.509
This is the real thing.

141
00:07:51.542 --> 00:07:53.577
- Aren't you that guy from,
it's that that blog, right?


142
00:07:53.611 --> 00:07:54.412
What's the name of it?

143
00:07:54.444 --> 00:07:56.180
- HandleWithScare.com.

144
00:07:56.213 --> 00:07:58.082
- Yeah, yeah, that's the one!

145
00:07:58.115 --> 00:07:59.283
- [Both] Yeah!

146
00:07:59.317 --> 00:08:01.419
- I think that's the, is it?
- Yeah.


147
00:08:01.451 --> 00:08:03.521
Look, it's been a long trip.

148
00:08:03.554 --> 00:08:05.222
Do you know where I can
find the Rutherfords?


149
00:08:05.256 --> 00:08:07.325
- Yeah, they're right over
there by registration.


150
00:08:07.358 --> 00:08:08.392
That's where I'm headed.

151
00:08:08.426 --> 00:08:09.459
- Awesome.

152
00:08:09.493 --> 00:08:12.363
(cheerful music)

153
00:08:12.396 --> 00:08:13.531
- Mr. and Mrs. Rutherford?

154
00:08:13.564 --> 00:08:14.365
- Yes.

155
00:08:14.398 --> 00:08:15.599
- That's us.

156
00:08:15.633 --> 00:08:17.168
- I'm so excited
for this weekend.


157
00:08:17.201 --> 00:08:18.302
- So are we.

158
00:08:18.336 --> 00:08:20.204
- When do we get to see blood?

159
00:08:20.237 --> 00:08:21.339
- The entire weekend.

160
00:08:22.206 --> 00:08:24.108
- I can't wait. (giggles)

161
00:08:24.141 --> 00:08:24.942
- Jesus!

162
00:08:26.143 --> 00:08:27.611
These people make me nuts.

163
00:08:29.447 --> 00:08:31.115
Jonah, you made it.

164
00:08:31.148 --> 00:08:33.384
- Ah, Mr. Rutherford,

165
00:08:34.752 --> 00:08:37.321
Jonah Perrigo,
HandleWithScare.com.


166
00:08:37.355 --> 00:08:39.457
- We know exactly
who you are, Jonah.


167
00:08:39.490 --> 00:08:41.425
- How was your trip?

168
00:08:41.459 --> 00:08:44.662
- Well, it is going
to go in my review.


169
00:08:45.963 --> 00:08:47.765
- What do you need
from me, Jonah?


170
00:08:47.798 --> 00:08:49.000
- Sleep.

171
00:08:49.033 --> 00:08:50.134
Where are your cabins?

172
00:08:51.335 --> 00:08:52.136
All right.

173
00:08:52.169 --> 00:08:54.038
Well, before I go,

174
00:08:54.071 --> 00:08:55.940
you got time for
a quick interview?


175
00:08:55.973 --> 00:08:57.441
- Jonah, we are so busy.

176
00:08:57.476 --> 00:08:58.743
I don't want to be late, okay?

177
00:08:58.776 --> 00:09:00.945
Listen, you get settled in,

178
00:09:00.978 --> 00:09:02.213
and then we'll find time

179
00:09:02.246 --> 00:09:03.614
for a nice, little
talk later, okay?


180
00:09:03.647 --> 00:09:06.183
- Quick question, where
will the first kill be?


181
00:09:06.217 --> 00:09:07.585
- Wouldn't you like to know.

182
00:09:07.618 --> 00:09:08.552
- Mmm.

183
00:09:08.586 --> 00:09:10.454
Yeah, very true.

184
00:09:10.489 --> 00:09:11.856
Fair point.

185
00:09:11.889 --> 00:09:13.924
- Have you seen Hunter?

186
00:09:13.958 --> 00:09:16.093
- Darlene, why would
we want him here?


187
00:09:16.127 --> 00:09:17.895
- We're paying him enough.

188
00:09:17.928 --> 00:09:19.930
- We put him in a
cabin in the woods


189
00:09:19.964 --> 00:09:21.799
so the other campers
wouldn't see him.


190
00:09:21.832 --> 00:09:23.100
- Well, have you seen him?

191
00:09:23.134 --> 00:09:24.969
- No, but we've exchanged texts.

192
00:09:25.002 --> 00:09:26.203
You gotta calm down.

193
00:09:26.237 --> 00:09:27.972
Look, everything is
set for tonight, okay?


194
00:09:28.005 --> 00:09:29.640
It's all in place.

195
00:09:29.673 --> 00:09:31.008
- No, it better be.

196
00:09:31.042 --> 00:09:33.210
We sunk a lot of money
into this damn camp!


197
00:09:40.217 --> 00:09:42.653
(dark music)

198
00:09:47.526 --> 00:09:50.294
(crowd cheering)

199
00:09:51.496 --> 00:09:54.533
- And that's why we're
here tonight, campers,


200
00:09:54.565 --> 00:09:59.570
for the Camp Echo Lake
Camp of Terror experience.


201
00:10:00.304 --> 00:10:01.506
(suspenseful music)

202
00:10:01.540 --> 00:10:02.973
- They don't wanna
hear that shit!


203
00:10:04.241 --> 00:10:06.077
Get to the good stuff.

204
00:10:06.110 --> 00:10:07.178
- What's that, Mike?

205
00:10:08.547 --> 00:10:11.516
- The story of what happened
to the Meadows family


206
00:10:11.550 --> 00:10:15.753
20 years ago, the
kidnapping, little Echo,


207
00:10:15.786 --> 00:10:19.223
and the brutal murder
of her parents,


208
00:10:19.256 --> 00:10:21.158
John and Ruby.

209
00:10:23.327 --> 00:10:25.329
- Tell us the rest of the story!

210
00:10:25.362 --> 00:10:27.465
- Yeah, that's why we're here!

211
00:10:27.499 --> 00:10:30.034
- We paid extra money to
be the first campers here.


212
00:10:30.067 --> 00:10:31.602
- Yeah, a lotta money!

213
00:10:31.635 --> 00:10:32.636
- Give us some excitement!

214
00:10:32.670 --> 00:10:34.038
- And it better be scary.

215
00:10:34.071 --> 00:10:35.239
- Okay.

216
00:10:35.272 --> 00:10:36.407
Okay.

217
00:10:36.440 --> 00:10:38.342
But you asked for it.

218
00:10:38.375 --> 00:10:39.511
So here goes.

219
00:10:40.411 --> 00:10:42.913
(eerie music)

220
00:10:46.817 --> 00:10:50.454
The story supposedly
says that 20 years ago,


221
00:10:52.591 --> 00:10:57.061
on this exact night,
Halloween weekend in 2002.


222
00:11:00.297 --> 00:11:02.333
(dark ominous tones)

223
00:11:02.366 --> 00:11:04.435
(John and Ruby arguing)

224
00:11:04.468 --> 00:11:08.939
(humming "This Little
Light of Mine")


225
00:11:23.020 --> 00:11:27.158
(John and Ruby continue arguing)

226
00:11:28.493 --> 00:11:29.293
(glass breaking)

227
00:11:29.326 --> 00:11:31.729
(Echo gasps)

228
00:11:34.566 --> 00:11:36.967
(Echo humming)

229
00:11:37.001 --> 00:11:38.802
- What are you humming, Big Sis?

230
00:11:38.836 --> 00:11:40.004
- My favorite song.

231
00:11:40.037 --> 00:11:41.906
It drowns out their arguing.

232
00:11:41.939 --> 00:11:44.108
- I know you don't like
it when they argue.


233
00:11:45.309 --> 00:11:47.912
Mom and Dad are going to
camp this weekend, too.


234
00:11:47.945 --> 00:11:48.846
Grownup camp.

235
00:11:50.080 --> 00:11:51.315
- Wanna see my costume?

236
00:11:54.018 --> 00:11:56.488
- So what are you
supposed to be?


237
00:11:57.489 --> 00:11:59.591
- This year for Halloween,

238
00:11:59.624 --> 00:12:01.258
I'm going to be happy.

239
00:12:02.960 --> 00:12:04.629
- I think I'm gonna
be a werewolf!


240
00:12:06.063 --> 00:12:07.898
- I've gotta show Mom and Dad.

241
00:12:07.932 --> 00:12:10.635
(gentle music)

242
00:12:10.669 --> 00:12:12.903
- John, this is my last
go at this marriage.


243
00:12:12.937 --> 00:12:14.104
If you want it to work,

244
00:12:14.138 --> 00:12:16.508
you're gonna take this
retreat seriously.


245
00:12:16.541 --> 00:12:17.775
I mean it this time, okay?

246
00:12:17.808 --> 00:12:19.009
I...

247
00:12:19.043 --> 00:12:21.445
- Mommy, Daddy, just be happy!

248
00:12:22.614 --> 00:12:25.282
I thought you weren't
going to argue anymore.


249
00:12:25.316 --> 00:12:26.116
- See, John.

250
00:12:27.151 --> 00:12:29.253
I told you the
children could hear us.


251
00:12:30.555 --> 00:12:32.122
- Just let me handle this.

252
00:12:32.156 --> 00:12:34.492
(melancholy music)

253
00:12:34.526 --> 00:12:37.995
Sweetie, Mommy and
Daddy were not arguing.


254
00:12:38.028 --> 00:12:39.863
We were talking about
how excited we are


255
00:12:39.897 --> 00:12:41.700
for adult camp this weekend!

256
00:12:41.732 --> 00:12:43.067
- Why are you so loud then?

257
00:12:44.569 --> 00:12:45.803
My friends at school said

258
00:12:45.836 --> 00:12:49.608
you and Mommy are going
to get a separation.


259
00:12:49.641 --> 00:12:52.577
(melancholy music)

260
00:12:56.715 --> 00:12:58.415
- It's called a divorce, honey.

261
00:13:00.050 --> 00:13:01.586
Don't worry.

262
00:13:01.620 --> 00:13:03.688
Me and your father
love each other dearly.


263
00:13:05.422 --> 00:13:06.223
Right, hun?

264
00:13:11.563 --> 00:13:12.930
Now, why don't you go
finish getting ready, okay?


265
00:13:12.963 --> 00:13:14.398
We're gonna leave in 30 minutes.

266
00:13:14.431 --> 00:13:17.334
(melancholy music)

267
00:13:19.370 --> 00:13:20.137
- Hey!

268
00:13:20.170 --> 00:13:21.939
You forgetting someone?

269
00:13:21.972 --> 00:13:22.840
Where's my hug?

270
00:13:25.175 --> 00:13:27.278
Did you help your little brother
pick out his costume yet?


271
00:13:27.311 --> 00:13:29.113
- Jasper, I have
to go help Jasper!


272
00:13:29.146 --> 00:13:30.515
- Yes, you heard your mother,

273
00:13:30.548 --> 00:13:32.182
we leave in 30 minutes!

274
00:13:34.686 --> 00:13:36.854
Be happy, my little princess!

275
00:13:36.887 --> 00:13:38.590
- [Echo] Jasper, Jasper,
come on, get ready.


276
00:13:38.623 --> 00:13:39.724
We're going to camp!

277
00:13:39.758 --> 00:13:42.727
(melancholy music)

278
00:13:47.898 --> 00:13:50.669
(dramatic music)

279
00:13:57.808 --> 00:14:00.311
(tense music)

280
00:14:10.622 --> 00:14:13.057
- Dammit, Ruby, you
missed the turn!


281
00:14:13.090 --> 00:14:14.925
We're gonna run outta gas now!

282
00:14:14.958 --> 00:14:17.261
I told you to get gas
at the last rest stop!


283
00:14:17.294 --> 00:14:20.030
Now, we're gonna be stranded
in the middle of nowhere!


284
00:14:20.064 --> 00:14:22.166
- Quiet, John, you're
gonna wake the kids.


285
00:14:23.334 --> 00:14:25.869
- Just get out and
let me drive, Ruby!


286
00:14:25.903 --> 00:14:28.005
- I'm not getting out
and waking the kids.


287
00:14:29.340 --> 00:14:30.809
There has to be a gas station
around here somewhere.


288
00:14:30.841 --> 00:14:32.811
We're only 10 miles
away from the camp.


289
00:14:34.244 --> 00:14:36.113
- I really wish you would
just listen to me, Ruby.


290
00:14:36.146 --> 00:14:38.182
- John, stop fighting with me!

291
00:14:39.584 --> 00:14:41.385
I thought you wanted this
relationship to work.


292
00:14:42.587 --> 00:14:44.756
We need to be a good
example to our kids.


293
00:14:44.789 --> 00:14:47.391
Let's just get a bite to
eat, find a gas station,


294
00:14:47.424 --> 00:14:48.992
then drop the kids off at camp.

295
00:14:51.261 --> 00:14:52.664
Then we'll go to
marriage counseling,


296
00:14:52.697 --> 00:14:54.998
and see if we can
make this work.


297
00:14:55.866 --> 00:14:58.770
(melancholy music)

298
00:15:00.505 --> 00:15:01.338
- Fine.

299
00:15:06.711 --> 00:15:09.346
(eerie ominous music)

300
00:15:09.380 --> 00:15:12.082
(people talking)

301
00:15:22.960 --> 00:15:24.128
- May I be excused?

302
00:15:24.161 --> 00:15:25.996
I need to use the bathroom.

303
00:15:28.867 --> 00:15:30.367
- Go with her.

304
00:15:30.401 --> 00:15:32.737
I'll stay here with Jasper
and take care of the bill.


305
00:15:34.506 --> 00:15:35.607
- I'm a big girl, Dad.

306
00:15:35.640 --> 00:15:37.341
I don't need Mom to go with me.

307
00:15:41.378 --> 00:15:42.212
- Go with her.

308
00:15:54.358 --> 00:15:57.361
So little buddy, you
excited for camp?


309
00:15:57.394 --> 00:15:59.129
- Yeah.
- (chuckles) Yeah.


310
00:15:59.163 --> 00:16:00.832
Well, finish your lunch, okay?

311
00:16:00.865 --> 00:16:01.666
I'm gonna go pay the bill.

312
00:16:01.699 --> 00:16:02.634
I'll be right back.

313
00:16:12.677 --> 00:16:15.780
(dark crashing tone)

314
00:16:19.016 --> 00:16:21.853
(toilet flushing)

315
00:16:28.493 --> 00:16:29.928
- Did you wash your hands, Echo?

316
00:16:29.960 --> 00:16:31.228
- Yes, Mom.

317
00:16:31.261 --> 00:16:33.430
- Okay, Jasper and
Daddy are waiting.


318
00:16:33.464 --> 00:16:34.298
Let's go.

319
00:16:42.574 --> 00:16:43.508
- Where's, Echo?

320
00:16:43.541 --> 00:16:45.309
- Right behind me.

321
00:16:45.342 --> 00:16:46.578
- I don't see her, Mommy.

322
00:16:48.813 --> 00:16:50.047
- Jesus Christ,
you left her inside


323
00:16:50.080 --> 00:16:51.448
the bathroom alone
again, didn't you?


324
00:16:51.483 --> 00:16:53.016
- She was right behind me.

325
00:16:53.050 --> 00:16:56.053
(suspenseful music)

326
00:17:09.601 --> 00:17:11.401
- Stay with Jasper.

327
00:17:11.435 --> 00:17:14.438
(suspenseful music)

328
00:17:27.451 --> 00:17:28.653
- That's my favorite.

329
00:17:32.657 --> 00:17:33.491
- You want it?

330
00:17:35.025 --> 00:17:35.960
- [John] I'll be
right back, Son.


331
00:17:35.994 --> 00:17:36.861
- Okay, Dad.

332
00:17:40.430 --> 00:17:42.767
- But my parents said
I can't have any candy


333
00:17:42.800 --> 00:17:44.636
until Halloween night.

334
00:17:46.370 --> 00:17:49.474
- Listen, my name's Lou,

335
00:17:49.507 --> 00:17:50.440
and I work here.

336
00:17:52.242 --> 00:17:54.879
I don't see anybody around
us right now, do you?


337
00:17:54.913 --> 00:17:56.113
(door clicks)

338
00:17:56.146 --> 00:17:57.147
- [John] Echo?

339
00:17:57.180 --> 00:17:59.049
Echo, sweetie, where are you?

340
00:17:59.951 --> 00:18:00.752
- That's my dad.

341
00:18:00.785 --> 00:18:02.386
I better go, Lou.

342
00:18:02.419 --> 00:18:03.253
- Hey.

343
00:18:04.421 --> 00:18:06.891
You save this for later, okay?

344
00:18:06.925 --> 00:18:09.928
(tense music)

345
00:18:09.961 --> 00:18:12.030
My sweet little princess, okay?

346
00:18:14.866 --> 00:18:17.735
- What have I told you
about talking to strangers?


347
00:18:17.769 --> 00:18:19.336
- But, but-
- No.


348
00:18:19.369 --> 00:18:22.306
- Sir, she wasn't
talking to a stranger.


349
00:18:22.339 --> 00:18:23.508
My name's Lou.

350
00:18:23.541 --> 00:18:24.809
I work here.

351
00:18:24.842 --> 00:18:26.176
- All right, thank you,

352
00:18:26.209 --> 00:18:27.444
but we really gotta go.

353
00:18:27.478 --> 00:18:28.412
We're gonna be late for camp.

354
00:18:28.445 --> 00:18:29.446
Thanks.

355
00:18:29.480 --> 00:18:30.949
- Camp?

356
00:18:30.982 --> 00:18:31.816
Which camp?

357
00:18:34.052 --> 00:18:35.887
- [John] Yeah, I
forget the name of it.


358
00:18:35.920 --> 00:18:36.721
- Camp Pleasant Lake, Lou.

359
00:18:36.754 --> 00:18:38.221
It's the Halloween camp.

360
00:18:39.389 --> 00:18:40.825
- Sorry, we gotta go.

361
00:18:40.858 --> 00:18:41.726
Thanks again.

362
00:18:43.761 --> 00:18:46.330
(tense music)

363
00:18:46.363 --> 00:18:47.197
- You're lucky.

364
00:18:48.499 --> 00:18:50.334
My boy, Lou, here is a good man.

365
00:18:51.736 --> 00:18:54.104
Next person comin'
along might not be.


366
00:18:56.708 --> 00:18:58.977
Keep an eye on your
little girl now, ya hear?


367
00:19:01.445 --> 00:19:03.313
- Ouch, that hurts, Daddy.

368
00:19:03.347 --> 00:19:04.549
- Let's go.

369
00:19:04.582 --> 00:19:06.084
Now, we're definitely
gonna be late for camp.


370
00:19:07.384 --> 00:19:09.887
(tense music)

371
00:19:21.599 --> 00:19:22.432
- Yes, sir.

372
00:19:24.002 --> 00:19:25.402
- And I want my
goddamn belt back.


373
00:19:25.435 --> 00:19:26.537
You give me that back-

374
00:19:26.571 --> 00:19:28.806
Yo, yo, excuse me, sir!
(dramatic music)


375
00:19:28.840 --> 00:19:29.674
Watch it mister!

376
00:19:29.707 --> 00:19:30.508
- Sorry, apologies.

377
00:19:30.541 --> 00:19:31.375
Didn't see you.

378
00:19:31.408 --> 00:19:33.176
- Okay, that's fine.

379
00:19:33.210 --> 00:19:35.046
- Thanks.
- There you go.


380
00:19:35.079 --> 00:19:38.650
- Some folks don't take too
kindly to be bumped into.


381
00:19:38.683 --> 00:19:40.150
- Better keep an eye

382
00:19:40.183 --> 00:19:42.954
on your little girl next
time, too, huh? (chuckles)


383
00:19:44.421 --> 00:19:45.623
- Let's go.

384
00:19:45.657 --> 00:19:46.524
Now!

385
00:19:46.557 --> 00:19:47.792
- Hey, hey, hey, hey!

386
00:19:47.825 --> 00:19:49.627
That's no way to
speak to your wife.


387
00:19:50.928 --> 00:19:52.697
- Not nice at all.

388
00:19:52.730 --> 00:19:54.866
- We's nice around here.

389
00:19:54.899 --> 00:19:55.967
(dark music)

390
00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:58.002
- Very nice. (giggles)
- Watch out


391
00:19:58.036 --> 00:20:00.237
for that little girl

392
00:20:00.270 --> 00:20:02.473
and that little boy.

393
00:20:02.507 --> 00:20:05.275
- Better watch out
for that one there.


394
00:20:05.308 --> 00:20:07.712
(dark music)

395
00:20:13.084 --> 00:20:14.317
- Move, please.

396
00:20:15.887 --> 00:20:17.088
Get out of our way!

397
00:20:19.724 --> 00:20:21.859
- They're right, mister.

398
00:20:21.893 --> 00:20:24.394
The next person
may not be so nice.


399
00:20:25.763 --> 00:20:27.431
- You aren't that nice.

400
00:20:30.101 --> 00:20:31.769
- Is that so?

401
00:20:33.571 --> 00:20:35.907
- You don't know what you're
talking about, little boy.


402
00:20:37.008 --> 00:20:38.408
- Hey, kids,

403
00:20:38.442 --> 00:20:42.680
some children are better
to be seen than heard.


404
00:20:42.714 --> 00:20:45.016
(dark music)

405
00:20:45.049 --> 00:20:48.285
- Good thing we raised
our boy right here.


406
00:20:51.923 --> 00:20:52.724
Not like you!

407
00:20:54.092 --> 00:20:55.893
- Dad raised us right!

408
00:20:55.927 --> 00:20:59.429
(threatening music)

409
00:20:59.463 --> 00:21:01.933
- What's your name, little man?

410
00:21:01.966 --> 00:21:02.900
- I'm Jasper.

411
00:21:08.371 --> 00:21:09.707
This is my sister, Echo.

412
00:21:10.775 --> 00:21:13.745
- Aren't you a cutie pie?

413
00:21:15.646 --> 00:21:17.181
- Just move out of our way.

414
00:21:17.215 --> 00:21:18.616
We really need to get going.

415
00:21:19.851 --> 00:21:22.452
- Dad, that hurts!

416
00:21:22.487 --> 00:21:24.021
- Treat 'em right.

417
00:21:24.055 --> 00:21:26.456
They won't be around forever.

418
00:21:26.491 --> 00:21:28.092
- Come on, go, go, let's go.

419
00:21:31.629 --> 00:21:34.297
(ominous music)

420
00:21:39.537 --> 00:21:42.339
- Tim, be a dear,

421
00:21:42.372 --> 00:21:44.976
and get the sheriff
on the phone for me.


422
00:21:45.009 --> 00:21:46.244
- Yes, ma'am, right away!

423
00:21:48.513 --> 00:21:49.847
- You know what to do.

424
00:21:51.916 --> 00:21:54.384
(dark music)

425
00:21:54.417 --> 00:21:55.787
- Yes, Esmeralda.

426
00:21:59.123 --> 00:22:02.560
- Oh, Ezra, it'll be worth it.

427
00:22:07.632 --> 00:22:09.000
- The sheriff's on the line.

428
00:22:12.670 --> 00:22:14.205
- [Sheriff] Sheriff Dean here.

429
00:22:14.238 --> 00:22:15.940
- It Esmeralda.

430
00:22:15.973 --> 00:22:16.941
- Always a pleasure.

431
00:22:16.974 --> 00:22:18.075
What can I do for you?

432
00:22:19.043 --> 00:22:20.310
- Lou's following a family

433
00:22:20.343 --> 00:22:22.914
of city slickers
straight into camp.


434
00:22:24.248 --> 00:22:26.117
You know what to do.

435
00:22:26.150 --> 00:22:26.951
- Say no more.

436
00:22:26.984 --> 00:22:28.686
I'll keep him covered.

437
00:22:28.719 --> 00:22:31.122
(dark music)

438
00:22:32.190 --> 00:22:33.825
- Thank you, Tim.

439
00:22:33.858 --> 00:22:35.259
- [Tim] Yes, Esmeralda.

440
00:22:39.730 --> 00:22:43.366
(Esmeralda laughs)

441
00:22:43.400 --> 00:22:45.903
(tense music)

442
00:23:04.021 --> 00:23:07.325
(tense music continues)

443
00:23:41.292 --> 00:23:43.094
- Jasper, wake up.

444
00:23:43.127 --> 00:23:44.729
We're at camp, sweetie.

445
00:23:45.863 --> 00:23:48.366
(tense music)

446
00:23:54.105 --> 00:23:54.939
Go.

447
00:23:57.475 --> 00:23:58.376
Go ahead, honey.

448
00:23:58.408 --> 00:23:59.176
It's only for the weekend.

449
00:23:59.210 --> 00:24:00.211
We'll see you on Monday.

450
00:24:05.883 --> 00:24:07.118
Take my phone.

451
00:24:07.151 --> 00:24:09.020
I'll call you tonight
from Daddy's phone.


452
00:24:14.792 --> 00:24:16.459
(dark music)

453
00:24:16.494 --> 00:24:17.528
- Hello!

454
00:24:17.561 --> 00:24:19.462
Welcome to Camp Pleasant Lake!

455
00:24:19.497 --> 00:24:21.098
I'm Mr. Corbin.

456
00:24:21.132 --> 00:24:22.600
- [Jasper] Hi, I'm Jasper.

457
00:24:22.633 --> 00:24:23.734
I'm a werewolf for Halloween.

458
00:24:23.768 --> 00:24:26.203
- That's a great
costume, Jasper!


459
00:24:27.672 --> 00:24:28.472
- Nice.

460
00:24:28.506 --> 00:24:30.107
- Cool costume!

461
00:24:30.141 --> 00:24:31.976
- And I'm his
older sister, Echo.


462
00:24:33.411 --> 00:24:34.545
- Where's your costume?

463
00:24:37.815 --> 00:24:39.750
What is that supposed to be?

464
00:24:39.784 --> 00:24:40.685
- [Echo] Happy.

465
00:24:40.718 --> 00:24:41.953
(children laughing)

466
00:24:41.986 --> 00:24:43.120
- That's the stupidest
thing I've ever heard.


467
00:24:43.154 --> 00:24:44.655
- What an idiot!

468
00:24:44.689 --> 00:24:46.958
(children laughing)

469
00:24:46.991 --> 00:24:48.592
- [Camper] Look
at me, I'm happy!


470
00:24:48.626 --> 00:24:50.460
- You have a problem with that?

471
00:24:53.931 --> 00:24:55.733
(intense music)

472
00:24:55.766 --> 00:24:57.301
(children laughing)

473
00:24:57.335 --> 00:24:59.070
- [Child] What a loser!

474
00:24:59.103 --> 00:25:00.438
- Loser!
- Loser!


475
00:25:03.274 --> 00:25:05.876
- Don't worry
about these losers.


476
00:25:05.910 --> 00:25:06.811
(children laughing)

477
00:25:06.844 --> 00:25:08.012
- There she goes!

478
00:25:10.014 --> 00:25:11.582
Aren't you supposed to be happy?

479
00:25:11.615 --> 00:25:12.850
(children laughing)

480
00:25:12.883 --> 00:25:16.187
- [Camper] Oh, you're
gonna cry to your mommy?


481
00:25:16.220 --> 00:25:18.289
- Look at him! (laughing)

482
00:25:18.322 --> 00:25:20.658
(sad music)

483
00:25:23.894 --> 00:25:26.330
(twig snaps)

484
00:25:33.804 --> 00:25:34.972
- Stupid mask!

485
00:25:38.009 --> 00:25:39.643
Nobody wants to
hang out with me.


486
00:25:42.179 --> 00:25:44.515
(sad music)

487
00:25:56.360 --> 00:25:58.829
It's you, the, the, the...

488
00:26:01.866 --> 00:26:03.667
- The man from the restaurant.

489
00:26:04.702 --> 00:26:06.837
I'm Ezra, Lou's father.

490
00:26:07.872 --> 00:26:08.706
- You work here?

491
00:26:09.607 --> 00:26:10.674
- Hmm, uh-uh.

492
00:26:12.443 --> 00:26:14.412
I work at Camp Hope.

493
00:26:14.445 --> 00:26:17.248
(sad music)

494
00:26:17.281 --> 00:26:19.250
- The other kids were
making fun of me.


495
00:26:20.151 --> 00:26:21.285
I hate it here!

496
00:26:22.653 --> 00:26:24.989
(sad music)

497
00:26:26.491 --> 00:26:27.725
- There's that smile.

498
00:26:29.160 --> 00:26:32.096
(Ezra chuckles)

499
00:26:32.129 --> 00:26:33.264
You know what?

500
00:26:34.999 --> 00:26:37.234
My camp's right down the road.

501
00:26:37.268 --> 00:26:38.369
Lou's there, too.

502
00:26:44.241 --> 00:26:45.876
- I like Lou.

503
00:26:45.910 --> 00:26:46.744
He gave me this.

504
00:26:47.611 --> 00:26:48.979
It's my favorite.

505
00:26:49.013 --> 00:26:50.414
- Well, that's a good thing,

506
00:26:51.782 --> 00:26:53.818
'cause there's a whole
bunch more of it at my camp.


507
00:26:54.985 --> 00:26:55.786
You wanna go?

508
00:26:56.654 --> 00:26:57.489
- Yeah!

509
00:26:58.622 --> 00:27:00.357
Wait, where's Jasper?

510
00:27:02.660 --> 00:27:04.628
I don't wanna forget about him.

511
00:27:04.662 --> 00:27:06.297
- We won't forget about Jasper.

512
00:27:07.465 --> 00:27:08.866
We'll come back and get him.

513
00:27:09.834 --> 00:27:10.668
I,

514
00:27:11.802 --> 00:27:12.603
I...

515
00:27:12.636 --> 00:27:13.437
- Promise?

516
00:27:13.471 --> 00:27:14.305
- I promise.

517
00:27:16.674 --> 00:27:17.942
- Okay.

518
00:27:17.975 --> 00:27:19.844
The kids don't like
me here anyway.


519
00:27:19.877 --> 00:27:21.378
They broke my costume.

520
00:27:23.013 --> 00:27:24.483
(sad music)

521
00:27:24.516 --> 00:27:25.382
- That's a shame.

522
00:27:26.817 --> 00:27:27.818
But it's all right.

523
00:27:28.953 --> 00:27:31.088
We're gonna make you
another one at my camp.


524
00:27:32.790 --> 00:27:34.825
- Okay, let's go then.

525
00:27:34.859 --> 00:27:36.495
- Boys, boys, break it up!

526
00:27:36.528 --> 00:27:37.461
- Say that again!

527
00:27:37.496 --> 00:27:38.497
- She's a freak!

528
00:27:38.530 --> 00:27:39.430
- That's enough, guys!

529
00:27:39.463 --> 00:27:40.297
Come on!

530
00:27:43.767 --> 00:27:44.603
- Where's Echo?

531
00:27:46.403 --> 00:27:47.905
- Looks like she
finally found a friend.


532
00:27:47.938 --> 00:27:49.206
(children laughing)

533
00:27:49.240 --> 00:27:50.609
- Echo!

534
00:27:50.641 --> 00:27:51.476
Echo!

535
00:27:52.376 --> 00:27:53.744
Echo!
(train whistle blowing)


536
00:27:53.777 --> 00:27:54.613
Echo!

537
00:28:01.486 --> 00:28:04.188
(soft dramatic music)

538
00:28:04.221 --> 00:28:07.024
- And little Echo Meadows

539
00:28:07.057 --> 00:28:11.362
was never seen or
heard from again.


540
00:28:13.330 --> 00:28:14.732
- And rumor has it,

541
00:28:14.765 --> 00:28:17.536
Echo still roams these woods.

542
00:28:17.569 --> 00:28:20.271
- I heard she comes back

543
00:28:20.304 --> 00:28:24.208
every Halloween looking for him.

544
00:28:24.241 --> 00:28:25.644
And if we're lucky,

545
00:28:27.011 --> 00:28:30.014
she'll come back tonight.

546
00:28:30.047 --> 00:28:31.215
- I love this shit!

547
00:28:31.248 --> 00:28:32.850
- Shit, me, too!

548
00:28:32.883 --> 00:28:36.521
- Wait, you don't actually
think this shit is real, do you?


549
00:28:36.555 --> 00:28:38.022
- Come on, man.

550
00:28:38.055 --> 00:28:40.024
The Rutherfords made this
shit up just to make a buck.


551
00:28:40.057 --> 00:28:41.725
- What happened to him?

552
00:28:41.759 --> 00:28:43.060
- What happened to who?

553
00:28:45.196 --> 00:28:46.397
- Echo's little brother.

554
00:28:48.132 --> 00:28:49.200
What happened to him?

555
00:28:49.233 --> 00:28:53.871
- Neither him or his sister

556
00:28:53.904 --> 00:28:55.706
was ever seen again.

557
00:28:57.808 --> 00:28:58.776
What?

558
00:28:58.809 --> 00:28:59.611
(dramatic music)

559
00:28:59.644 --> 00:29:00.512
You asked what happened.

560
00:29:02.179 --> 00:29:02.980
- Hoo!

561
00:29:03.013 --> 00:29:04.315
Hoo, hoo!

562
00:29:04.348 --> 00:29:05.749
- The fuck's wrong with you?

563
00:29:05.783 --> 00:29:07.051
- He probably wasn't
hugged enough as a child.


564
00:29:07.084 --> 00:29:09.654
(group laughs)

565
00:29:21.932 --> 00:29:22.833
- Camp of Terror,

566
00:29:25.402 --> 00:29:28.339
you really wanna
know the real story?


567
00:29:28.372 --> 00:29:30.007
- Yeah!
- Of course!


568
00:29:30.040 --> 00:29:31.208
- Now, the legend goes,

569
00:29:32.376 --> 00:29:35.580
that Echo Meadows was kidnapped

570
00:29:35.614 --> 00:29:37.616
by a very evil man,

571
00:29:37.649 --> 00:29:38.949
(eerie music)

572
00:29:38.983 --> 00:29:41.852
because that evil man
and his wife, Esmeralda,


573
00:29:41.885 --> 00:29:43.988
desperately wanted
a little girl,


574
00:29:45.422 --> 00:29:47.291
but they just couldn't get one.

575
00:29:47.324 --> 00:29:48.792
So-

576
00:29:48.826 --> 00:29:53.030
- So then, when John and
Ruby Meadows left the camp,


577
00:29:53.897 --> 00:29:56.367
they were brutally murdered,

578
00:29:56.400 --> 00:29:59.203
and the killer was never found!

579
00:29:59.236 --> 00:30:04.241
Locals say Echo
returns every Halloween


580
00:30:05.342 --> 00:30:07.811
to these woods
looking for family.


581
00:30:07.845 --> 00:30:08.680
And

582
00:30:09.913 --> 00:30:11.549
- If you get in her way,

583
00:30:11.583 --> 00:30:13.951
she will slash you,

584
00:30:13.984 --> 00:30:16.220
and leave you with a sad,

585
00:30:16.253 --> 00:30:18.690
bloody frown on your face!

586
00:30:19.890 --> 00:30:23.662
- So then you can
feel the same pain


587
00:30:23.695 --> 00:30:25.095
she once did!

588
00:30:25.129 --> 00:30:26.564
- When does the terror start?

589
00:30:26.598 --> 00:30:27.431
- Tomorrow!

590
00:30:28.733 --> 00:30:30.602
So you may all want
to turn in soon,


591
00:30:30.635 --> 00:30:32.169
and get a good night's sleep.

592
00:30:32.202 --> 00:30:36.273
- Actually, the terror has
already started tonight.


593
00:30:37.441 --> 00:30:42.046
Supposedly, Echo
Meadows went wandering


594
00:30:42.079 --> 00:30:45.149
in the forest the night
that she was kidnapped,


595
00:30:45.182 --> 00:30:48.986
the very same night that her
parents were brutally murdered.


596
00:30:50.187 --> 00:30:51.889
- Any camper that
gets in her way,


597
00:30:51.922 --> 00:30:53.324
well, you know (air hissing).

598
00:30:54.992 --> 00:30:58.829
- Now, you wanted the extra
Camp of Terror experience.


599
00:30:58.862 --> 00:31:00.831
Well, you have got it!

600
00:31:00.864 --> 00:31:02.567
With the VIP experience,

601
00:31:02.600 --> 00:31:06.337
you will be the first
campers to relive the horror


602
00:31:06.370 --> 00:31:10.007
that happened that
night 20 years ago,


603
00:31:10.040 --> 00:31:12.042
right here, right now,

604
00:31:12.076 --> 00:31:14.144
in the all new Camp of Terror!

605
00:31:15.513 --> 00:31:17.448
(group cheers)

606
00:31:17.482 --> 00:31:20.217
(dramatic music)

607
00:31:21.418 --> 00:31:24.756
- And how 'bout
that interview now?


608
00:31:24.789 --> 00:31:26.924
- No, sorry, Jonah.

609
00:31:26.957 --> 00:31:27.792
- I see.

610
00:31:28.959 --> 00:31:30.427
- Grab the original crew.

611
00:31:30.461 --> 00:31:32.162
Let's meet at the
tunnel in a bit.


612
00:31:32.196 --> 00:31:33.030
- I got you.

613
00:31:36.367 --> 00:31:38.670
(campers laughing)

614
00:31:38.703 --> 00:31:41.539
(suspenseful music)

615
00:31:41.573 --> 00:31:42.774
- [Camper 1] Whoa, what's that?

616
00:31:42.807 --> 00:31:44.441
- This place looks awesome!

617
00:31:44.476 --> 00:31:46.009
- Wonder how long
it's been here?


618
00:31:47.177 --> 00:31:48.780
- [Camper 2] What,
tryin' to scare us?


619
00:31:48.813 --> 00:31:49.714
- [Camper 3] Is this
part of the camp?


620
00:31:49.748 --> 00:31:50.849
- Are you ready?

621
00:31:51.783 --> 00:31:53.283
- Let's act surprised.

622
00:31:53.317 --> 00:31:55.820
We gotta put on a really
good show for the campers.


623
00:31:55.854 --> 00:31:57.221
- Let's do this!

624
00:31:57.254 --> 00:32:00.090
(engine revving)

625
00:32:00.124 --> 00:32:01.760
Let's hear you, man!

626
00:32:02.694 --> 00:32:03.961
You guys wanted a show.

627
00:32:03.994 --> 00:32:05.697
(group cheers)

628
00:32:05.730 --> 00:32:08.432
(engine revving)

629
00:32:11.736 --> 00:32:14.938
- You all wanted the Camp
of Terror experience?


630
00:32:14.972 --> 00:32:17.876
Well, here you go!

631
00:32:17.908 --> 00:32:19.009
Hurry!

632
00:32:19.042 --> 00:32:20.779
- Let's go!
(campers screaming)


633
00:32:20.812 --> 00:32:22.714
(engine revving)

634
00:32:22.747 --> 00:32:24.181
(campers scream)

635
00:32:24.214 --> 00:32:25.517
(body thuds)

636
00:32:25.550 --> 00:32:27.151
- We all saw what happened.

637
00:32:27.184 --> 00:32:28.385
- We didn't know she
was being kidnapped.


638
00:32:28.419 --> 00:32:29.420
It's not our fault.

639
00:32:30.688 --> 00:32:32.690
(eerie ominous tones)
- Echo!


640
00:32:32.724 --> 00:32:34.224
- I'm his big sister, Echo.

641
00:32:34.258 --> 00:32:35.159
- What an idiot!

642
00:32:35.192 --> 00:32:36.193
(children laughing)

643
00:32:36.226 --> 00:32:37.327
- She's a freak!

644
00:32:37.361 --> 00:32:40.130
(dramatic music)

645
00:32:41.365 --> 00:32:45.068
(children laughing)

646
00:32:45.102 --> 00:32:47.004
Aren't you supposed to be happy?

647
00:32:47.037 --> 00:32:50.307
(dramatic music)

648
00:32:50.340 --> 00:32:51.509
- Echo!

649
00:32:51.543 --> 00:32:52.710
- Look at him!

650
00:32:52.744 --> 00:32:53.545
(children laughing)

651
00:32:53.578 --> 00:32:54.813
- [Jasper] Echo!

652
00:32:54.846 --> 00:32:56.313
Echo!

653
00:32:56.346 --> 00:32:57.749
- Jacob's right.

654
00:32:57.782 --> 00:32:59.751
We all saw what happened,

655
00:32:59.784 --> 00:33:01.151
and did nothing about it.

656
00:33:01.185 --> 00:33:03.220
- We had our chance
when the cops came.


657
00:33:03.253 --> 00:33:04.889
- They asked us if
we saw anything.


658
00:33:04.923 --> 00:33:06.791
- And we all said no.

659
00:33:06.825 --> 00:33:08.493
- We-
- Should've told the cops


660
00:33:08.526 --> 00:33:09.494
what we saw!

661
00:33:09.527 --> 00:33:10.862
- But we kept our mouths shut!

662
00:33:10.895 --> 00:33:12.429
- Look, we're all
in this together.


663
00:33:12.463 --> 00:33:15.567
- We stick to our
original story.


664
00:33:15.600 --> 00:33:17.301
We saw nothing.

665
00:33:17.334 --> 00:33:18.168
Got it?

666
00:33:19.203 --> 00:33:20.003
(twig snaps)

667
00:33:20.037 --> 00:33:20.839
- Who's that?

668
00:33:20.872 --> 00:33:21.773
Who's there?

669
00:33:21.806 --> 00:33:22.507
- "Who's that, who's there?"

670
00:33:22.540 --> 00:33:23.440
Calm down, dude!

671
00:33:23.475 --> 00:33:24.676
You're always freakin' out.

672
00:33:24.709 --> 00:33:25.976
It's probably nothin'.

673
00:33:26.009 --> 00:33:28.145
- That, or...
- Echo Meadows!


674
00:33:29.213 --> 00:33:30.180
(group laughs)

675
00:33:30.214 --> 00:33:31.114
- [Jacob] Stop it.

676
00:33:31.148 --> 00:33:32.015
- What's the matter, Jacob?

677
00:33:32.049 --> 00:33:33.518
You scared?

678
00:33:33.551 --> 00:33:34.953
(group laughs)

679
00:33:34.985 --> 00:33:36.588
- In all seriousness,

680
00:33:36.621 --> 00:33:39.356
the Rutherfords are payin'
us good money for this,


681
00:33:39.389 --> 00:33:42.192
so let's give those
campers what they came for,


682
00:33:42.226 --> 00:33:44.027
a weekend of terror!

683
00:33:44.061 --> 00:33:45.295
- And remember,
starting tomorrow,


684
00:33:45.329 --> 00:33:48.198
we will all be getting
killed off one by one.


685
00:33:48.232 --> 00:33:50.033
The Rutherfords will
be telling the campers


686
00:33:50.067 --> 00:33:51.669
Echo took us all.

687
00:33:51.703 --> 00:33:54.304
- And that's why they won't
be seein' our dead bodies.


688
00:33:54.338 --> 00:33:56.774
We meet back at the
counselor's lodge on Monday,


689
00:33:56.808 --> 00:34:00.143
Halloween morning, and
do it all over again


690
00:34:00.177 --> 00:34:01.713
for a new batch of campers.

691
00:34:01.746 --> 00:34:03.180
- It's easy money for everyone.

692
00:34:03.213 --> 00:34:05.415
- Now, let's get back to
our tents and get some rest.


693
00:34:05.449 --> 00:34:07.785
It's gonna be a
long, bloody weekend!


694
00:34:09.086 --> 00:34:11.723
(ominous music)

695
00:34:16.059 --> 00:34:18.796
(fire crackling)

696
00:34:20.732 --> 00:34:22.767
(gravel crunching)

697
00:34:22.800 --> 00:34:26.303
(eerie suspenseful music)

698
00:34:44.923 --> 00:34:45.990
(skin sizzling)
(Jacob cries out)


699
00:34:46.024 --> 00:34:49.027
- Ahh, fuck!

700
00:34:49.059 --> 00:34:51.261
Ow, what the fuck?

701
00:34:51.295 --> 00:34:53.498
I thought this shit was
supposed to be fake?


702
00:34:55.033 --> 00:34:56.433
(Jacob grunts)

703
00:34:56.466 --> 00:34:59.971
(eerie suspenseful music)

704
00:35:09.614 --> 00:35:10.815
This isn't funny!

705
00:35:10.848 --> 00:35:12.382
What the fuck, Hunter?

706
00:35:13.885 --> 00:35:16.621
(dramatic music)

707
00:35:21.759 --> 00:35:25.295
(operatic dramatic music)

708
00:35:32.570 --> 00:35:33.504
Ugh!

709
00:35:33.538 --> 00:35:36.040
(tense music)

710
00:35:38.843 --> 00:35:42.179
(train whistle blowing)

711
00:35:45.415 --> 00:35:47.351
- (chuckles) I guess
Jacob is still bent


712
00:35:47.384 --> 00:35:48.418
from last night, huh?

713
00:35:50.021 --> 00:35:51.789
- Maybe he's hung over.

714
00:35:51.823 --> 00:35:53.057
- I'm surprised.

715
00:35:53.091 --> 00:35:54.926
His big ass never
misses breakfast.


716
00:35:54.959 --> 00:35:57.862
(group laughs)

717
00:35:57.895 --> 00:35:59.731
- Let's go wake his lazy ass up.

718
00:35:59.764 --> 00:36:01.633
- Like Mike said, we're all
in this together, right?


719
00:36:01.666 --> 00:36:02.734
- Right.

720
00:36:02.767 --> 00:36:03.568
Let's go.

721
00:36:09.540 --> 00:36:11.943
(dark music)

722
00:36:16.014 --> 00:36:18.616
(chuckles) Oh.

723
00:36:20.652 --> 00:36:23.320
(curious music)

724
00:36:26.924 --> 00:36:28.960
Guess you got axed
first, huh, buddy?


725
00:36:30.762 --> 00:36:32.764
Hey, come check this out.

726
00:36:34.732 --> 00:36:37.669
(mysterious music)

727
00:36:43.007 --> 00:36:44.108
- Wow, it looks like

728
00:36:44.142 --> 00:36:45.877
the Rutherfords started
the party early.


729
00:36:45.910 --> 00:36:47.478
- This looks fake.

730
00:36:47.512 --> 00:36:49.547
We need to tell the Rutherfords
to make it look more real.


731
00:36:49.580 --> 00:36:51.281
- It's not too bad!

732
00:36:51.314 --> 00:36:53.316
- The Rutherfords are
cheap as hell, man!


733
00:36:55.318 --> 00:36:56.621
- What do you think, Mike?

734
00:36:58.790 --> 00:37:00.357
- Remember what the
Rutherfords said,


735
00:37:00.390 --> 00:37:02.527
"They're gonna make it
look as real as possible."


736
00:37:02.560 --> 00:37:04.929
These campers paid good
money for this shit.


737
00:37:05.897 --> 00:37:07.131
(someone whistles)

738
00:37:07.165 --> 00:37:09.634
Hey, what are you doin' here?

739
00:37:09.667 --> 00:37:10.935
This is the counselors'
campgrounds.


740
00:37:10.968 --> 00:37:13.270
You should be with
the other campers.


741
00:37:13.303 --> 00:37:15.006
(tense music)

742
00:37:15.039 --> 00:37:17.374
(lips pop)

743
00:37:17.407 --> 00:37:19.644
- Mike, Mike, did you see this?

744
00:37:19.677 --> 00:37:21.746
This Hunter did great work, huh?

745
00:37:21.779 --> 00:37:22.947
- Who?

746
00:37:22.980 --> 00:37:24.482
- Hunter, the guy we hired

747
00:37:24.515 --> 00:37:26.818
to do the special effects
that would look so great.


748
00:37:26.851 --> 00:37:28.653
- Not in front of
the other campers.


749
00:37:29.854 --> 00:37:31.254
- What are you talking about?
- What the?


750
00:37:31.288 --> 00:37:33.157
That little fucker
was just here.


751
00:37:33.191 --> 00:37:34.092
- Who, who are
you talkin' about?


752
00:37:34.125 --> 00:37:35.827
- That weird camper, he was.

753
00:37:35.860 --> 00:37:36.694
Nevermind.

754
00:37:38.496 --> 00:37:41.666
So who's gonna get it next?

755
00:37:41.699 --> 00:37:44.836
(Rick chuckles)

756
00:37:44.869 --> 00:37:47.705
(Darlene giggles)

757
00:37:53.044 --> 00:37:55.980
(mysterious music)

758
00:38:08.726 --> 00:38:09.694
(skin squelching)

759
00:38:09.727 --> 00:38:12.262
(Lou groaning)

760
00:38:14.565 --> 00:38:17.267
- Who the fuck are you?

761
00:38:17.300 --> 00:38:19.804
(tense music)

762
00:38:31.582 --> 00:38:32.415
Fuck.

763
00:38:39.624 --> 00:38:40.892
Jesus Christ.

764
00:38:40.925 --> 00:38:43.460
(eerie music)

765
00:38:55.173 --> 00:38:55.973
Ugh!

766
00:38:56.007 --> 00:38:57.175
What the fuck?

767
00:39:01.279 --> 00:39:02.113
Huh?

768
00:39:02.146 --> 00:39:04.649
(eerie music)

769
00:39:21.666 --> 00:39:22.500
Mom? Dad?

770
00:39:26.871 --> 00:39:27.705
Dad?

771
00:39:33.211 --> 00:39:35.880
Where the fuck did you get that?

772
00:39:38.983 --> 00:39:39.984
Who are you?

773
00:39:48.092 --> 00:39:48.926
Ugh!

774
00:39:51.662 --> 00:39:55.432
(dramatic suspenseful music)

775
00:40:01.939 --> 00:40:04.208
- I heard Jacob got it first.

776
00:40:04.242 --> 00:40:05.343
- Which one was Jacob?

777
00:40:05.375 --> 00:40:07.044
- You know, the chubby one.

778
00:40:07.078 --> 00:40:07.912
- (laughing) Oh, that guy.

779
00:40:09.412 --> 00:40:10.581
Yeah.

780
00:40:10.615 --> 00:40:12.683
- So how long you think
it took to kill him?


781
00:40:12.717 --> 00:40:14.018
- Shit, long enough.

782
00:40:14.051 --> 00:40:15.418
I mean, he probably
tried to talk


783
00:40:15.452 --> 00:40:16.854
the killer's ear off first.

784
00:40:16.888 --> 00:40:17.688
- Seriously.

785
00:40:17.722 --> 00:40:19.090
- This is bullshit.

786
00:40:19.123 --> 00:40:20.892
We didn't even get to
see any of the carnage.


787
00:40:20.925 --> 00:40:22.894
- Yeah, I mean, we
paid extra for this.


788
00:40:22.927 --> 00:40:24.328
- They should have come got us.

789
00:40:24.362 --> 00:40:26.130
- Look, why don't you guys

790
00:40:26.163 --> 00:40:28.799
just enjoy your lunch
and stop complaining.


791
00:40:28.833 --> 00:40:29.767
Nobody wants to hear it.

792
00:40:29.800 --> 00:40:31.302
- Fuckin'.
- This guy.


793
00:40:32.469 --> 00:40:33.938
- [Camper] Yeah, what is wrong?

794
00:40:33.971 --> 00:40:36.641
- Yeah, we paid good money for
this horror camp experience.


795
00:40:37.642 --> 00:40:39.777
- Just give us what we want!

796
00:40:39.810 --> 00:40:42.412
- We wanna see.
- We wanna see blood!


797
00:40:42.445 --> 00:40:43.681
Blood!

798
00:40:43.714 --> 00:40:46.651
- People, please,
take it easy here.


799
00:40:46.684 --> 00:40:49.086
I can hear you arguing all
the way down the trail.


800
00:40:49.120 --> 00:40:52.089
- Why didn't you come get
us when you offed Jacob?


801
00:40:52.123 --> 00:40:54.158
- Jacob was a, was
a bonus, right?


802
00:40:54.191 --> 00:40:55.126
- Yeah.

803
00:40:55.159 --> 00:40:56.794
- Correct me if I'm wrong,

804
00:40:56.827 --> 00:40:59.363
an unforgettable, most brutal,

805
00:40:59.397 --> 00:41:02.033
horrifying Camp of
Terror experience.


806
00:41:02.066 --> 00:41:03.267
- Right?
- Yeah.


807
00:41:03.301 --> 00:41:06.070
You kinda forgot the
bloody, horrifying part.


808
00:41:06.103 --> 00:41:08.205
- We wanted to see Jacob get it.

809
00:41:08.239 --> 00:41:10.641
- Yeah, not be told about
a fake pool of blood.


810
00:41:10.675 --> 00:41:12.810
- Yeah, we didn't
even know how he died.


811
00:41:13.878 --> 00:41:15.913
- Rick, give us what we want.

812
00:41:15.947 --> 00:41:17.982
- We want what you promised!

813
00:41:18.015 --> 00:41:19.917
- Yeah, the Camp of
Terror experience.


814
00:41:22.420 --> 00:41:24.021
- Are you ripping us off?

815
00:41:24.055 --> 00:41:25.823
- What's going on Mr.
and Mrs. Rutherford?


816
00:41:25.856 --> 00:41:27.457
- No, come on, please, people.

817
00:41:27.491 --> 00:41:30.361
Look, today is gonna be epic.

818
00:41:30.394 --> 00:41:33.331
I promise you we are
gonna have blood, okay?


819
00:41:35.032 --> 00:41:36.667
What happened with Hunter?

820
00:41:36.701 --> 00:41:39.103
He didn't even tell me
he was gonna off Jacob.


821
00:41:39.136 --> 00:41:41.339
That was scheduled for today.

822
00:41:41.372 --> 00:41:43.474
- I just saw someone
over by the fire pit.


823
00:41:44.575 --> 00:41:45.977
Looks like they're setting up.

824
00:41:46.010 --> 00:41:48.646
- You again, the weird camper.

825
00:41:48.679 --> 00:41:49.513
What do you want?

826
00:41:50.548 --> 00:41:53.484
(campers laughing)

827
00:41:55.920 --> 00:41:58.489
- It's only day two
(indistinct) a shit show.


828
00:41:58.522 --> 00:42:00.024
- Listen, I'm gonna
go check on Hunter.


829
00:42:00.057 --> 00:42:02.126
You get them all excited
about tonight, all right?


830
00:42:02.159 --> 00:42:04.929
- Tell Hunter if
he fucks up again,


831
00:42:04.962 --> 00:42:06.530
I'll be the one killing his ass.

832
00:42:08.065 --> 00:42:09.934
Okay, campers, listen.

833
00:42:09.967 --> 00:42:12.003
- Hey, how about
that interview now?


834
00:42:12.036 --> 00:42:15.474
- Sorry, Jonah, I need to
get the campers excited.


835
00:42:15.506 --> 00:42:17.441
You wanna see blood, campers?

836
00:42:17.476 --> 00:42:18.309
- Yeah.
- Yes.


837
00:42:19.877 --> 00:42:20.878
- [Darlene] Now you're
going to get it.


838
00:42:20.911 --> 00:42:22.213
- Can I quote you on that?

839
00:42:23.647 --> 00:42:26.984
- Go back to your
cabins and get ready.


840
00:42:27.018 --> 00:42:30.421
We meet at the fire
pit in two hours.


841
00:42:30.454 --> 00:42:31.422
Okay?

842
00:42:31.455 --> 00:42:33.157
Let's go.
- Hell, yeah!


843
00:42:33.190 --> 00:42:36.193
- Let's do it.
- Let's do it.


844
00:42:36.227 --> 00:42:38.763
(tense music)

845
00:42:48.472 --> 00:42:50.641
- Hey, you okay?

846
00:42:56.847 --> 00:42:57.681
What's wrong?

847
00:43:01.685 --> 00:43:03.954
- I don't like when the
campers make fun of me.


848
00:43:05.256 --> 00:43:06.323
- Who made fun of you?

849
00:43:07.358 --> 00:43:08.692
Who are you talking about?

850
00:43:14.432 --> 00:43:15.733
- All of you.

851
00:43:15.766 --> 00:43:18.436
(ominous music)

852
00:43:20.838 --> 00:43:22.973
- I heard what Mike
said to you back there.


853
00:43:23.974 --> 00:43:24.942
Don't listen to him.

854
00:43:24.975 --> 00:43:25.976
He's an asshole.

855
00:43:30.281 --> 00:43:31.348
What's your name?

856
00:43:31.382 --> 00:43:32.950
I'm Gracie-
- You were part of it.


857
00:43:34.418 --> 00:43:35.719
(camper laughs)

858
00:43:35.753 --> 00:43:38.155
(dark music)

859
00:43:46.597 --> 00:43:49.266
(curious music)

860
00:43:53.037 --> 00:43:54.638
- I could kill Hunter right now.

861
00:43:57.041 --> 00:44:00.512
I can't believe that little
prick screwed us over like this!


862
00:44:05.182 --> 00:44:08.052
You told me that he
was top notch, Darlene.


863
00:44:08.085 --> 00:44:10.754
- He came highly recommended
on their company site.


864
00:44:10.788 --> 00:44:12.256
- Well, we have no killer now.

865
00:44:13.357 --> 00:44:15.059
And no killer means
angry campers.


866
00:44:15.092 --> 00:44:17.328
And angry campers means refunds.

867
00:44:20.631 --> 00:44:24.768
Every camper paid $10,000
to be here this weekend.


868
00:44:24.802 --> 00:44:27.972
And we have a whole nother bunch
of 'em coming in on Monday.


869
00:44:28.005 --> 00:44:29.807
We're gonna lose a ton of money,

870
00:44:29.840 --> 00:44:31.275
and I don't like to lose.

871
00:44:32.143 --> 00:44:33.578
- I called the company,

872
00:44:33.612 --> 00:44:34.778
and they said they're
trying to send someone out


873
00:44:34.812 --> 00:44:36.013
as soon as possible.

874
00:44:36.046 --> 00:44:37.214
- Darlene, it's
Halloween weekend.


875
00:44:37.248 --> 00:44:39.650
They're all booked,
for God's sake!


876
00:44:41.185 --> 00:44:43.555
Now, all these campers
are gonna gather here


877
00:44:43.588 --> 00:44:45.890
in an hour and 30 minutes.

878
00:44:45.923 --> 00:44:47.224
We have to figure
out something fast,


879
00:44:47.258 --> 00:44:48.593
or we are fucked!

880
00:44:49.827 --> 00:44:51.496
I'd put on the Echo
costume myself,


881
00:44:51.530 --> 00:44:52.930
but I'm not five five, dear.

882
00:44:53.898 --> 00:44:55.065
- You.

883
00:44:55.099 --> 00:44:56.100
- [Rick] Oh, please.

884
00:45:02.873 --> 00:45:05.276
(dark music)

885
00:45:10.814 --> 00:45:12.883
- Mrs. Rutherford.
- Yeah, yeah, hold on.


886
00:45:13.784 --> 00:45:15.052
(light bouncy music)

887
00:45:15.085 --> 00:45:16.687
- How's your husband?

888
00:45:16.720 --> 00:45:17.622
- [Darlene] Yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.


889
00:45:17.656 --> 00:45:19.089
- He's late like usual.

890
00:45:19.123 --> 00:45:20.824
- Yeah, what's going on?

891
00:45:20.858 --> 00:45:22.459
- This is supposed to
be a camp of terror.


892
00:45:22.494 --> 00:45:24.862
- Yeah, not a camp
of nightmares.


893
00:45:24.895 --> 00:45:26.830
- I wouldn't call
any of this terror.


894
00:45:26.864 --> 00:45:28.832
- It's been more like
camp of nap time.


895
00:45:28.866 --> 00:45:30.167
(campers chuckle)

896
00:45:30.201 --> 00:45:31.802
- Camp of nap time.

897
00:45:33.337 --> 00:45:34.438
I like that.

898
00:45:34.471 --> 00:45:37.107
- So Mrs. Rutherford,
where is your-


899
00:45:37.141 --> 00:45:38.577
- He'll be here soon.

900
00:45:38.610 --> 00:45:39.644
Don't worry.

901
00:45:39.678 --> 00:45:41.045
- How much longer?

902
00:45:41.078 --> 00:45:42.581
- Man, we've been
waiting for like an hour!


903
00:45:42.614 --> 00:45:43.548
- Be patient.

904
00:45:43.582 --> 00:45:44.882
He'll be here.

905
00:45:44.915 --> 00:45:46.784
Where the fuck are you, Rick?

906
00:45:46.817 --> 00:45:49.920
(light bouncy music)

907
00:45:52.790 --> 00:45:53.958
- There he is.

908
00:45:55.694 --> 00:45:57.027
- Let's get the show going.

909
00:45:59.296 --> 00:46:00.864
- Okay.

910
00:46:00.898 --> 00:46:01.700
First of all,

911
00:46:01.732 --> 00:46:03.167
I want to thank you all

912
00:46:03.200 --> 00:46:05.769
for showing up this weekend
for the Camp of Terror.


913
00:46:07.204 --> 00:46:09.940
I don't know quite how to
say this, but here goes.


914
00:46:09.974 --> 00:46:10.774
- [Camper] There he is.

915
00:46:10.808 --> 00:46:11.643
Hey!

916
00:46:12.510 --> 00:46:15.246
(dramatic music)

917
00:46:17.114 --> 00:46:18.349
- Get him, Echo.

918
00:46:18.382 --> 00:46:19.250
- It's show time!

919
00:46:19.283 --> 00:46:20.619
- We wanna see.

920
00:46:20.652 --> 00:46:21.486
- Blood!
- Yeah!


921
00:46:21.519 --> 00:46:24.255
(dramatic music)

922
00:46:26.190 --> 00:46:27.091
Get him, Echo!

923
00:46:28.993 --> 00:46:31.829
- (chuckling) Hunter,
you son of a bitch,


924
00:46:31.862 --> 00:46:33.097
you fuckin' made it.

925
00:46:33.130 --> 00:46:33.964
Ooh!

926
00:46:34.898 --> 00:46:35.966
- Let's do this.

927
00:46:37.001 --> 00:46:39.103
Let's give 'em a show.

928
00:46:39.136 --> 00:46:40.471
- Get him, Echo.

929
00:46:41.539 --> 00:46:43.774
- You think I'm afraid of you?

930
00:46:43.807 --> 00:46:45.042
(knife swishing)
Ugh!


931
00:46:45.075 --> 00:46:46.611
- Bravo! Bravo!

932
00:46:46.645 --> 00:46:48.747
- Now, that's what
I'm talkin' about.


933
00:46:48.779 --> 00:46:50.114
(dramatic music)

934
00:46:50.147 --> 00:46:51.148
- Holy shit!

935
00:46:53.384 --> 00:46:55.119
- He's killing the campers too.

936
00:46:55.152 --> 00:46:56.387
- That's more like it.
- Hey, that's what I mean.


937
00:46:56.420 --> 00:46:57.221
- Awesome.

938
00:46:57.254 --> 00:46:59.990
(dramatic music)

939
00:47:01.191 --> 00:47:02.259
- Gettin' better.

940
00:47:04.128 --> 00:47:05.863
- Great death scene, Hector.

941
00:47:05.896 --> 00:47:07.164
- You too, camper girl.

942
00:47:08.667 --> 00:47:11.835
- You wanted blood, you got it!

943
00:47:11.869 --> 00:47:14.639
Welcome to the new
Camp of Terror!


944
00:47:15.774 --> 00:47:18.142
- [Camper] That's what
I'm talkin' about.


945
00:47:18.175 --> 00:47:20.478
(campers cheering)

946
00:47:20.512 --> 00:47:23.247
- Great job bringing
Hunter back.


947
00:47:23.280 --> 00:47:24.749
- I know.
- I want you to go


948
00:47:24.783 --> 00:47:26.016
and find Hunter,

949
00:47:26.050 --> 00:47:27.351
and have him send
his assistant Adam


950
00:47:27.384 --> 00:47:28.787
to clean this shit up, okay?

951
00:47:28.819 --> 00:47:29.654
- [Darlene] Okay.

952
00:47:30.555 --> 00:47:31.388
- All right.

953
00:47:32.823 --> 00:47:34.825
That Darlene, she puts on
a good show, believe me.


954
00:47:35.859 --> 00:47:39.430
(train whistle blowing)

955
00:47:39.463 --> 00:47:42.466
(suspenseful music)

956
00:47:44.569 --> 00:47:45.436
- Hunter?

957
00:47:47.639 --> 00:47:48.573
Hunter!

958
00:47:53.712 --> 00:47:55.979
Rick is not mad at you.

959
00:47:56.013 --> 00:47:58.315
He thinks you're
doing a great job.


960
00:48:00.752 --> 00:48:02.453
Come on, Hunter,
where are you at?


961
00:48:03.954 --> 00:48:05.155
(phone chimes)

962
00:48:05.189 --> 00:48:08.192
(suspenseful music)

963
00:48:14.331 --> 00:48:16.233
Where the heck are you?

964
00:48:19.937 --> 00:48:22.640
Enough of these games, Hunter!

965
00:48:22.674 --> 00:48:23.475
(hand knocking)

966
00:48:23.508 --> 00:48:24.509
Hunter!

967
00:48:24.542 --> 00:48:25.376
Hunter!

968
00:48:26.811 --> 00:48:28.747
Stop messing with me,
(speaking in foreign language)!


969
00:48:30.615 --> 00:48:33.350
(phone chimes)

970
00:48:33.384 --> 00:48:35.886
(eerie music)

971
00:48:42.727 --> 00:48:44.763
Ha ha, this isn't funny.

972
00:48:46.130 --> 00:48:48.165
I'm telling Rick
you're messing with me.


973
00:48:57.908 --> 00:49:00.645
(killer humming)

974
00:49:04.682 --> 00:49:06.718
Stop messing with me, Hunter.

975
00:49:06.751 --> 00:49:08.787
We're paying you good
money for this gig.


976
00:49:09.621 --> 00:49:12.122
(tense music)

977
00:49:17.595 --> 00:49:20.931
(train whistle blowing)

978
00:49:27.070 --> 00:49:28.272
Rick was right.

979
00:49:28.305 --> 00:49:30.809
(eerie music)

980
00:49:33.444 --> 00:49:34.278
That's it.

981
00:49:37.181 --> 00:49:38.650
(knife swishing)

982
00:49:38.683 --> 00:49:41.418
(blood spurting)

983
00:49:45.389 --> 00:49:48.225
(killer grunting)

984
00:49:52.664 --> 00:49:54.799
(killer grunting)

985
00:49:54.833 --> 00:49:56.400
Who the fuck are you?

986
00:49:56.433 --> 00:49:59.771
(train whistle blowing)

987
00:50:03.808 --> 00:50:06.410
(gentle music)

988
00:50:07.712 --> 00:50:10.782
(counselors talking)

989
00:50:11.850 --> 00:50:12.684
- Opa, oh.

990
00:50:15.687 --> 00:50:16.621
Nostrovia.

991
00:50:16.654 --> 00:50:19.323
(hip-hop music)

992
00:50:24.194 --> 00:50:27.532
- You shared the shit out
of those campers earlier.


993
00:50:28.967 --> 00:50:30.702
- (chuckles) Literally to death.

994
00:50:30.735 --> 00:50:31.569
To death!

995
00:50:33.270 --> 00:50:35.607
- Hey, Mr. Rutherford,
where's Mrs. Rutherford?


996
00:50:38.108 --> 00:50:41.613
(concerned music)

997
00:50:41.646 --> 00:50:42.480
- Huh.

998
00:50:43.948 --> 00:50:44.949
- What's wrong?

999
00:50:44.983 --> 00:50:46.250
- Nothing.

1000
00:50:46.283 --> 00:50:47.652
But she should be back now.

1001
00:50:49.119 --> 00:50:49.921
- Talk to me.

1002
00:50:51.923 --> 00:50:54.124
- I sent Darlene
to gather up Hunter


1003
00:50:54.157 --> 00:50:56.460
for the second show
tonight, right?


1004
00:50:56.494 --> 00:50:58.496
The last thing I want
is anyone to think


1005
00:50:58.530 --> 00:51:00.598
that there's
anything going wrong.


1006
00:51:00.632 --> 00:51:01.900
- Yeah.

1007
00:51:01.933 --> 00:51:02.867
- Mike, you could
do me a big favor


1008
00:51:02.901 --> 00:51:03.835
and go look for those two.

1009
00:51:03.868 --> 00:51:05.603
I'll get everybody here ready.

1010
00:51:05.637 --> 00:51:10.608
- Yeah, yeah, of course.

1011
00:51:12.644 --> 00:51:14.177
- One more, and then we go back.

1012
00:51:15.245 --> 00:51:16.146
- Mrs. Rutherford?

1013
00:51:20.217 --> 00:51:21.051
Hunter?

1014
00:51:24.956 --> 00:51:25.857
Where are you guys?

1015
00:51:25.890 --> 00:51:28.026
We got a big night planned out.

1016
00:51:28.058 --> 00:51:31.061
(suspenseful music)

1017
00:51:32.362 --> 00:51:33.196
Mrs. Rutherford?

1018
00:51:34.164 --> 00:51:35.198
Hunter, is that you?

1019
00:51:36.601 --> 00:51:39.604
(suspenseful music)

1020
00:51:42.105 --> 00:51:44.876
(dramatic music)

1021
00:51:46.477 --> 00:51:47.612
What the fuck?

1022
00:51:53.885 --> 00:51:54.686
(footsteps crunch)

1023
00:51:54.719 --> 00:51:55.853
Who is that?

1024
00:51:55.887 --> 00:51:59.456
(suspenseful music)

1025
00:51:59.490 --> 00:52:00.290
Who's there?

1026
00:52:05.395 --> 00:52:06.196
Wait a minute.

1027
00:52:07.899 --> 00:52:09.366
I know what's going on.

1028
00:52:09.399 --> 00:52:10.935
It's my time to die.

1029
00:52:12.503 --> 00:52:13.470
Oh, they want a show?

1030
00:52:14.839 --> 00:52:16.206
I'll give 'em a show.

1031
00:52:16.239 --> 00:52:19.010
(suspenseful music)

1032
00:52:19.043 --> 00:52:20.511
Come on, guys, where are you?

1033
00:52:22.013 --> 00:52:24.214
I don't like being alone
at night by myself!


1034
00:52:25.083 --> 00:52:28.086
(suspenseful music)

1035
00:52:30.822 --> 00:52:32.289
I knew it.

1036
00:52:32.322 --> 00:52:34.993
Hunter, let's give
'em a real good show.


1037
00:52:35.026 --> 00:52:37.394
(eerie music)

1038
00:52:37.427 --> 00:52:39.396
Echo, is that you?

1039
00:52:41.633 --> 00:52:42.533
Don't hurt me.

1040
00:52:42.567 --> 00:52:44.267
Please, don't hurt me!

1041
00:52:44.301 --> 00:52:46.169
I'm sorry for what happened
to you and your family!


1042
00:52:46.203 --> 00:52:49.239
Please don't kill me!
(knife swishes)


1043
00:52:50.273 --> 00:52:51.141
Motherfucker!

1044
00:52:52.076 --> 00:52:54.277
Hunter, I'm gonna kill you!

1045
00:52:54.311 --> 00:52:55.613
Hey, get back here.

1046
00:52:55.647 --> 00:52:57.982
I don't get paid
enough for this shit!


1047
00:52:58.016 --> 00:53:00.752
(dramatic music)

1048
00:53:10.795 --> 00:53:12.764
Fucker, now you're mine.

1049
00:53:15.365 --> 00:53:17.035
You're mine, Hunter!

1050
00:53:21.606 --> 00:53:23.508
What the fuck is this place?

1051
00:53:23.541 --> 00:53:26.544
(suspenseful music)

1052
00:53:30.347 --> 00:53:32.684
(dramatic music)

1053
00:53:32.717 --> 00:53:33.985
Who the fuck are you?

1054
00:53:34.018 --> 00:53:36.654
(Lou grunts)

1055
00:53:36.688 --> 00:53:37.689
- Ugh, fuck.

1056
00:53:39.590 --> 00:53:40.491
Behind you.

1057
00:53:41.458 --> 00:53:44.261
(pipe smashes)

1058
00:53:44.294 --> 00:53:45.129
- All right, all
right, all right,


1059
00:53:45.163 --> 00:53:46.363
now let's listen up.

1060
00:53:46.396 --> 00:53:48.566
We are gonna give these campers

1061
00:53:48.599 --> 00:53:52.103
the greatest show of shows ever

1062
00:53:52.136 --> 00:53:56.641
because tonight, we
all die by the hand


1063
00:53:56.674 --> 00:54:01.012
of our very own
little Echo Meadows.


1064
00:54:01.045 --> 00:54:02.914
Little Echo Meadows, sha.

1065
00:54:02.947 --> 00:54:04.582
- [Counselors]
Woo, woo, woo, woo!


1066
00:54:09.754 --> 00:54:11.989
- All right, now, I want
you all to go get ready,


1067
00:54:12.023 --> 00:54:14.859
and we'll meet at
the fire pit in...


1068
00:54:14.892 --> 00:54:16.694
You thought I was
gonna spill, right?


1069
00:54:16.728 --> 00:54:19.530
We'll meet at the
fire pit in an hour.


1070
00:54:19.564 --> 00:54:21.733
See you there or be square.

1071
00:54:21.766 --> 00:54:23.801
- You're going in the wrong
direction, Mr. Rutherford.


1072
00:54:23.835 --> 00:54:25.069
- I am not.

1073
00:54:25.103 --> 00:54:27.872
I am going to find
my future ex-wife


1074
00:54:27.905 --> 00:54:30.875
because I believe she's fucking,

1075
00:54:31.843 --> 00:54:33.243
fucking Mike in the woods.

1076
00:54:34.244 --> 00:54:36.748
(eerie music)

1077
00:54:39.584 --> 00:54:42.252
Darlene?

1078
00:54:42.285 --> 00:54:44.321
Darlene, where the?

1079
00:54:44.354 --> 00:54:46.256
Where the hell are you?

1080
00:54:49.259 --> 00:54:52.630
(eerie music continues)

1081
00:54:58.435 --> 00:54:59.269
Darlene!

1082
00:55:01.672 --> 00:55:02.507
Darlene!

1083
00:55:05.676 --> 00:55:07.078
Stupid bitch.

1084
00:55:09.981 --> 00:55:10.815
Oh!

1085
00:55:15.153 --> 00:55:19.223
Oh!
(dramatic music)


1086
00:55:19.257 --> 00:55:20.558
There you are, you fucker.

1087
00:55:24.595 --> 00:55:26.063
Where's my wife and Mike?

1088
00:55:26.097 --> 00:55:27.430
Huh?

1089
00:55:27.464 --> 00:55:28.766
Don't fuck around with me.

1090
00:55:30.868 --> 00:55:32.570
You got a big show to do.

1091
00:55:32.603 --> 00:55:33.604
Now, come on.

1092
00:55:34.972 --> 00:55:36.174
Don't you fuck with me.

1093
00:55:36.207 --> 00:55:37.440
You understand?

1094
00:55:37.475 --> 00:55:39.376
You do your fucking job,

1095
00:55:39.409 --> 00:55:40.711
and we won't have.

1096
00:55:40.745 --> 00:55:41.546
Hang on.

1097
00:55:41.579 --> 00:55:43.181
Hang on.

1098
00:55:43.214 --> 00:55:44.347
Ooh!

1099
00:55:44.381 --> 00:55:47.384
(knife swishes)
Ugh!


1100
00:55:48.286 --> 00:55:50.453
Ooh, have me kill, Hunter.

1101
00:55:51.923 --> 00:55:54.592
(Rick groaning)

1102
00:56:00.298 --> 00:56:01.732
You?

1103
00:56:01.766 --> 00:56:05.102
(train whistle blowing)

1104
00:56:09.273 --> 00:56:12.276
(suspenseful music)

1105
00:56:31.329 --> 00:56:33.965
(guts squelching)
(Lou groaning)


1106
00:56:33.998 --> 00:56:36.834
(Mike whimpering)

1107
00:56:37.702 --> 00:56:40.304
(Lou groaning)

1108
00:57:02.526 --> 00:57:05.229
(hip-hop music)

1109
00:57:07.999 --> 00:57:09.200
- That's some good shit.

1110
00:57:09.233 --> 00:57:10.668
- And where did
you get that from?


1111
00:57:10.701 --> 00:57:12.637
- These fools got it from
one of the counselors.


1112
00:57:12.670 --> 00:57:14.005
- Which one?

1113
00:57:14.038 --> 00:57:14.839
- Who cares?

1114
00:57:14.872 --> 00:57:16.540
- Where the women at?

1115
00:57:16.574 --> 00:57:17.341
- I'm not good enough?

1116
00:57:17.375 --> 00:57:18.910
- I mean.

1117
00:57:18.943 --> 00:57:20.945
- Did we invite any
other ladies over?


1118
00:57:20.978 --> 00:57:23.581
- Man, you ain't got a
fuckin' shot with them anyway.


1119
00:57:23.614 --> 00:57:26.284
- Man, he said you
ain't got no game.


1120
00:57:26.317 --> 00:57:27.952
- Man, I got more game than any

1121
00:57:27.985 --> 00:57:29.954
of you motherfuckers combined.

1122
00:57:29.987 --> 00:57:30.821
- That burn.

1123
00:57:32.290 --> 00:57:34.525
- Come on, man,
pass that shit over.


1124
00:57:35.693 --> 00:57:36.761
- You can't handle
this shit, old man.


1125
00:57:36.794 --> 00:57:38.896
(hip-hop music)

1126
00:57:38.930 --> 00:57:40.331
- Let me have it.

1127
00:57:43.634 --> 00:57:46.304
- This camp sucks.

1128
00:57:46.337 --> 00:57:51.342
- They better kill off at
least one counselor tonight.


1129
00:57:52.476 --> 00:57:53.644
- [Camper 1] Yeah, I
wouldn't hold my breath.


1130
00:57:53.678 --> 00:57:54.879
- Shit, I thought this

1131
00:57:54.912 --> 00:57:56.914
Camp of Terror would
be more exciting.


1132
00:57:56.948 --> 00:57:58.582
- [Camper 1] They killed
off campers earlier today.


1133
00:57:59.850 --> 00:58:02.687
(campers talking)

1134
00:58:04.221 --> 00:58:07.024
- Knowing Gracie, she
probably paid extra


1135
00:58:07.058 --> 00:58:08.559
to have Rick kill her.

1136
00:58:08.592 --> 00:58:11.262
(hip-hop music)

1137
00:58:12.263 --> 00:58:13.130
- I know, right.

1138
00:58:13.164 --> 00:58:14.231
"He's behind you.

1139
00:58:14.265 --> 00:58:15.800
He's behind you."

1140
00:58:15.833 --> 00:58:18.102
(group laughing)

1141
00:58:18.135 --> 00:58:19.036
- [Smoking Camper]
How much you think


1142
00:58:19.070 --> 00:58:20.171
that ho paid to get killed?

1143
00:58:20.204 --> 00:58:21.105
- For that death?

1144
00:58:21.138 --> 00:58:22.807
500 tops, that shit was whack.

1145
00:58:22.840 --> 00:58:24.108
- Obviously.

1146
00:58:24.141 --> 00:58:25.343
- Obviously what?

1147
00:58:25.376 --> 00:58:27.044
- I mean, she knew
exactly where to go.


1148
00:58:27.078 --> 00:58:28.546
She was definitely in on it.

1149
00:58:28.579 --> 00:58:30.214
- [Camper 2] That doesn't
prove anything, man.


1150
00:58:30.247 --> 00:58:31.482
- Sure it does.

1151
00:58:31.515 --> 00:58:32.483
- How so?

1152
00:58:32.516 --> 00:58:35.152
- She was clearly jealous.

1153
00:58:35.186 --> 00:58:36.420
- Jealous of what?

1154
00:58:36.454 --> 00:58:38.756
- I was getting
all the attention.


1155
00:58:38.789 --> 00:58:40.191
- Yeah, she's got you there.

1156
00:58:41.592 --> 00:58:44.261
(hip-hop music)

1157
00:58:45.429 --> 00:58:46.964
- Epic?

1158
00:58:46.998 --> 00:58:49.400
It takes more than
one kill to be epic.


1159
00:58:49.433 --> 00:58:50.868
- Yeah, you got that right.

1160
00:58:50.901 --> 00:58:52.436
- Well, how many do you need?

1161
00:58:52.470 --> 00:58:54.872
- At least three or four.

1162
00:58:54.905 --> 00:58:56.941
- Or something really memorable.

1163
00:58:56.974 --> 00:58:59.076
- Yeah, like-
- Yeah, with lots of blood.


1164
00:59:00.811 --> 00:59:02.646
- I wonder what the
Rutherfords have


1165
00:59:02.680 --> 00:59:05.016
in store for us tonight.

1166
00:59:05.049 --> 00:59:06.117
- Well, whatever it is,

1167
00:59:06.150 --> 00:59:07.284
it better be good.

1168
00:59:08.419 --> 00:59:09.820
We paid good money
for this shit.


1169
00:59:09.854 --> 00:59:11.522
- Yeah, and we're just
sitting here doing nothing.


1170
00:59:11.555 --> 00:59:13.024
- In this shitty-ass RV.

1171
00:59:13.057 --> 00:59:15.059
- Bro, we should just leave.

1172
00:59:15.092 --> 00:59:16.327
- And go where?

1173
00:59:16.360 --> 00:59:19.163
- Hey, anywhere's
better than here.


1174
00:59:19.196 --> 00:59:20.031
- Let's go.

1175
00:59:22.666 --> 00:59:23.968
What you doing?

1176
00:59:24.001 --> 00:59:25.269
- What the fuck?

1177
00:59:25.302 --> 00:59:26.704
The door is locked.

1178
00:59:26.737 --> 00:59:28.406
- What?
(camper gasps)


1179
00:59:28.439 --> 00:59:30.941
- [Camper 1] Hey, somebody
open a fucking window!


1180
00:59:30.975 --> 00:59:32.410
- Come on!
- Hurry.


1181
00:59:32.443 --> 00:59:34.945
(eerie music)

1182
00:59:37.214 --> 00:59:38.416
- [Camper 3] Is that fire?

1183
00:59:38.449 --> 00:59:41.385
- [Camper 1] Hey, somebody open!

1184
00:59:41.419 --> 00:59:44.021
Hey, somebody open
a fucking window!


1185
00:59:44.055 --> 00:59:47.291
- Come on, come on, hurry!
- Help!


1186
00:59:47.324 --> 00:59:49.293
- What the fuck?
- Hey, somebody open


1187
00:59:49.326 --> 00:59:52.396
a fuckin' window!
- Come on.


1188
00:59:52.430 --> 00:59:53.664
(campers screaming)

1189
00:59:53.697 --> 00:59:56.467
(dramatic music)

1190
00:59:57.301 --> 00:59:59.970
(fists banging)

1191
01:00:08.245 --> 01:00:11.082
(explosion booms)

1192
01:00:13.651 --> 01:00:16.987
(train whistle blowing)

1193
01:00:23.562 --> 01:00:24.361
- Where's Rick?

1194
01:00:24.395 --> 01:00:25.396
He's late.

1195
01:00:25.429 --> 01:00:26.597
- I don't know.

1196
01:00:26.630 --> 01:00:27.465
- This better not be
another disappointment.


1197
01:00:27.499 --> 01:00:28.732
- Calm down.

1198
01:00:28.766 --> 01:00:31.035
I'm sure it will be
here any second now.


1199
01:00:31.068 --> 01:00:32.636
- The show was supposed
to start 30 minutes ago.


1200
01:00:32.670 --> 01:00:34.405
Don't you remember?

1201
01:00:34.438 --> 01:00:36.107
- He's just a little late.

1202
01:00:36.140 --> 01:00:36.941
Don't worry.

1203
01:00:36.974 --> 01:00:38.442
Tonight's gonna be epic.

1204
01:00:39.478 --> 01:00:40.845
- It better be.

1205
01:00:40.878 --> 01:00:43.380
(eerie music)

1206
01:00:45.349 --> 01:00:46.150
- Finally.

1207
01:00:46.183 --> 01:00:47.318
- It's about damn time.

1208
01:00:48.587 --> 01:00:50.354
Let's see some action.

1209
01:00:50.387 --> 01:00:51.922
Let's go.

1210
01:00:51.956 --> 01:00:54.024
- I guess we're
starting without Rick.


1211
01:00:54.058 --> 01:00:55.693
- Yeah, I guess so.

1212
01:00:55.726 --> 01:00:56.528
(dramatic music)

1213
01:00:56.561 --> 01:00:57.529
- Ooh.
- Yes!


1214
01:00:59.363 --> 01:01:00.164
- Oh, yes.

1215
01:01:03.067 --> 01:01:05.769
- I ain't scared of you!

1216
01:01:05.803 --> 01:01:07.805
- Oh!
- Oh, yeah!


1217
01:01:07.838 --> 01:01:08.639
- Epic!

1218
01:01:09.541 --> 01:01:10.509
- Holy shit.

1219
01:01:11.842 --> 01:01:13.612
Come give me a try.

1220
01:01:13.644 --> 01:01:14.445
(knife swishing)

1221
01:01:14.479 --> 01:01:17.214
(camper gagging)

1222
01:01:20.017 --> 01:01:21.486
- Hey, what about me?

1223
01:01:21.520 --> 01:01:24.255
(dramatic music)

1224
01:01:28.527 --> 01:01:29.594
- More! More!

1225
01:01:30.629 --> 01:01:32.196
- Let's go, fucker.

1226
01:01:33.797 --> 01:01:35.733
- Get 'em, Echo, mm hmm.

1227
01:01:37.001 --> 01:01:38.335
- Let's do this.

1228
01:01:40.371 --> 01:01:41.172
- Ooh!

1229
01:01:41.205 --> 01:01:43.974
(dramatic music)

1230
01:01:46.010 --> 01:01:46.844
Ooh!

1231
01:01:47.811 --> 01:01:49.514
(campers talking)

1232
01:01:49.548 --> 01:01:53.117
(dramatic music continues)

1233
01:01:59.223 --> 01:02:02.527
(train whistle blowing)

1234
01:02:05.229 --> 01:02:08.232
(suspenseful music)

1235
01:02:21.879 --> 01:02:24.649
- I'm gonna ask
you one more time


1236
01:02:27.485 --> 01:02:29.220
who the fuck are you?

1237
01:02:32.089 --> 01:02:32.990
Who's that?

1238
01:02:36.160 --> 01:02:38.195
(chains rattling)

1239
01:02:38.229 --> 01:02:40.965
(air whooshing)

1240
01:02:45.236 --> 01:02:47.738
(pipe clangs)

1241
01:02:55.647 --> 01:02:56.914
- Our last day of camp.

1242
01:02:58.148 --> 01:02:59.517
- You know what that means,

1243
01:03:00.619 --> 01:03:02.820
Echo's last day of terror.

1244
01:03:02.853 --> 01:03:05.022
- Yeah.
- Who do you think is next?


1245
01:03:05.055 --> 01:03:06.190
- Does it matter?

1246
01:03:06.223 --> 01:03:08.259
As long as it's gruesome.

1247
01:03:08.292 --> 01:03:10.427
I hope they double up the
blood on the next one.


1248
01:03:10.461 --> 01:03:12.863
- This is the best
camp experience ever.


1249
01:03:12.896 --> 01:03:14.064
- Mm hmm.

1250
01:03:14.098 --> 01:03:16.701
This is gonna make
for such a good blog.


1251
01:03:16.735 --> 01:03:19.203
- First Jacob, then Darlene,
then Mike, then Rick,


1252
01:03:19.236 --> 01:03:21.438
the new campers
arrive tomorrow, so...


1253
01:03:21.472 --> 01:03:23.642
- So then it's our turn
to die next then, right?


1254
01:03:23.675 --> 01:03:25.376
- I am so glad the
Rutherfords didn't tell us


1255
01:03:25.409 --> 01:03:26.578
when we're gonna die.

1256
01:03:26.611 --> 01:03:28.112
- I'm starting to
feel a little nervous.


1257
01:03:28.145 --> 01:03:30.247
This shit's starting
to feel kind of real.


1258
01:03:31.583 --> 01:03:33.551
(both laughing)

1259
01:03:33.585 --> 01:03:34.385
- Come on, let's
go meet the campers


1260
01:03:34.418 --> 01:03:35.687
over by the fire pits.

1261
01:03:35.720 --> 01:03:36.954
- Right, it is our
last day, right?


1262
01:03:36.987 --> 01:03:38.155
- Let's give 'em one last show.

1263
01:03:41.392 --> 01:03:44.395
(suspenseful music)

1264
01:03:50.769 --> 01:03:54.338
- (gasping) I can't breathe.

1265
01:03:54.371 --> 01:03:59.376
I can't breathe. (coughs)

1266
01:04:01.579 --> 01:04:03.113
Will I get out of this?

1267
01:04:09.487 --> 01:04:11.088
Who the fuck is that?

1268
01:04:12.856 --> 01:04:15.259
(eerie music)

1269
01:04:19.063 --> 01:04:19.897
No.

1270
01:04:19.930 --> 01:04:21.499
You don't understand!

1271
01:04:21.533 --> 01:04:23.267
No, you don't understand!

1272
01:04:23.300 --> 01:04:25.102
I didn't want to do that.

1273
01:04:25.135 --> 01:04:26.470
I didn't want to do that!

1274
01:04:26.504 --> 01:04:27.605
Listen.

1275
01:04:27.639 --> 01:04:29.641
I did that for...

1276
01:04:29.674 --> 01:04:32.976
(eerie music)

1277
01:04:33.010 --> 01:04:34.378
- Why are you turning here?

1278
01:04:38.683 --> 01:04:40.084
I know you hear me.

1279
01:04:42.152 --> 01:04:43.187
John!

1280
01:04:43.220 --> 01:04:45.155
- Yes, I heard you!

1281
01:04:45.189 --> 01:04:46.791
- Then why didn't you answer me?

1282
01:04:48.058 --> 01:04:49.326
What the fuck, John?

1283
01:04:50.394 --> 01:04:52.463
- I just thought
silence would be better


1284
01:04:52.497 --> 01:04:54.932
than yet another fight.

1285
01:04:54.965 --> 01:04:56.634
- Well, that
clearly didn't work.


1286
01:04:59.504 --> 01:05:00.739
Where are you going?

1287
01:05:00.772 --> 01:05:02.206
We're supposed to be
going the other way.


1288
01:05:02.239 --> 01:05:05.242
(suspenseful music)

1289
01:05:08.212 --> 01:05:10.180
- Why is this asshole
flashing me down?


1290
01:05:11.081 --> 01:05:12.282
- Just let him pass you.

1291
01:05:16.053 --> 01:05:17.154
- He's not passing us.

1292
01:05:18.723 --> 01:05:20.324
- Just keep waving him by.

1293
01:05:20.357 --> 01:05:22.259
- I'm already, I'm
already doing that!


1294
01:05:23.661 --> 01:05:24.829
I'm just gonna pull over.

1295
01:05:25.864 --> 01:05:29.701
(suspenseful music continues)

1296
01:05:41.613 --> 01:05:42.913
What's this asshole doing?

1297
01:05:48.318 --> 01:05:49.119
What the heck?

1298
01:05:49.153 --> 01:05:50.421
Ruby?

1299
01:05:50.454 --> 01:05:52.156
Ruby, where are you going?

1300
01:05:53.056 --> 01:05:56.895
(suspenseful music continues)

1301
01:06:01.932 --> 01:06:02.767
It's you.

1302
01:06:07.171 --> 01:06:08.071
Let's go, Ruby.

1303
01:06:09.473 --> 01:06:10.742
I said let's go!

1304
01:06:10.775 --> 01:06:12.976
- Hey, easy with
the little lady.


1305
01:06:13.010 --> 01:06:13.845
Okay?

1306
01:06:13.878 --> 01:06:14.679
(dramatic music)

1307
01:06:14.712 --> 01:06:15.513
Back off.

1308
01:06:15.547 --> 01:06:16.380
- Brother!

1309
01:06:18.115 --> 01:06:23.120
Mom and Dad always wanted
a sweet little princess.


1310
01:06:25.490 --> 01:06:27.525
- What the fuck are
you talking about, Lou?


1311
01:06:28.593 --> 01:06:29.894
You're scaring my wife!

1312
01:06:30.795 --> 01:06:32.029
- Hey, hey, easy, mister.

1313
01:06:33.230 --> 01:06:34.465
Actually, we're just
messing with you, man.


1314
01:06:34.499 --> 01:06:36.801
We just came by to
apologize to y'all


1315
01:06:36.835 --> 01:06:38.603
about what happened
earlier at the restaurant.


1316
01:06:38.636 --> 01:06:40.705
So don't shit yourself.

1317
01:06:43.240 --> 01:06:44.441
Let's have fun.

1318
01:06:44.476 --> 01:06:47.110
- It's okay, we
were just leaving.


1319
01:06:47.144 --> 01:06:50.280
- Hey Ruby, I'm sorry,

1320
01:06:52.584 --> 01:06:54.218
but you ain't going anywhere.

1321
01:06:55.118 --> 01:06:58.121
(threatening music)

1322
01:07:00.692 --> 01:07:02.259
- You don't have to do this!

1323
01:07:03.495 --> 01:07:07.164
- It's not what
we wanna do, John.


1324
01:07:09.299 --> 01:07:11.068
It's what we have to do!

1325
01:07:12.504 --> 01:07:14.037
We have to do this!

1326
01:07:15.205 --> 01:07:17.007
I am so sorry.

1327
01:07:19.009 --> 01:07:19.844
I'm sorry.

1328
01:07:22.012 --> 01:07:24.114
Mom wanted a little girl.

1329
01:07:25.048 --> 01:07:27.150
(dramatic music)

1330
01:07:27.184 --> 01:07:29.787
(John choking)

1331
01:07:32.422 --> 01:07:35.459
(dramatic music)

1332
01:07:35.493 --> 01:07:38.630
So Dad kidnapped her that day.

1333
01:07:45.335 --> 01:07:47.505
- [Killer] She had a name.

1334
01:07:48.472 --> 01:07:49.541
Echo Meadows!

1335
01:07:53.310 --> 01:07:54.846
(Lou spits)

1336
01:07:54.879 --> 01:07:56.714
- Jasper, is that you?

1337
01:08:01.385 --> 01:08:03.788
(Lou laughs)

1338
01:08:04.689 --> 01:08:07.357
(Jasper laughs)

1339
01:08:10.662 --> 01:08:13.531
Wait, there's two of you.

1340
01:08:13.565 --> 01:08:16.000
(eerie music)

1341
01:08:22.040 --> 01:08:24.542
- Echo, sweet little princess.

1342
01:08:26.978 --> 01:08:30.048
I knew, I knew you
would come back.


1343
01:08:30.080 --> 01:08:31.148
I knew it.

1344
01:08:31.181 --> 01:08:33.685
(eerie music)

1345
01:08:37.989 --> 01:08:41.593
But you shoulda never
to done what you did!


1346
01:08:47.431 --> 01:08:48.700
They loved you!

1347
01:08:48.733 --> 01:08:50.400
And you killed them.

1348
01:08:51.234 --> 01:08:54.237
(hammer squelching)

1349
01:09:01.012 --> 01:09:01.813
- Why?

1350
01:09:01.846 --> 01:09:04.448
Why are you doing this?

1351
01:09:04.482 --> 01:09:05.483
We love you.

1352
01:09:07.018 --> 01:09:07.852
- Uh!

1353
01:09:12.490 --> 01:09:14.191
You're not my father!

1354
01:09:14.224 --> 01:09:15.026
- Ezra?

1355
01:09:15.059 --> 01:09:15.860
(dramatic music)

1356
01:09:15.893 --> 01:09:17.862
Are you in here?

1357
01:09:17.895 --> 01:09:18.730
No!

1358
01:09:19.564 --> 01:09:20.865
No, no, no, no!

1359
01:09:22.100 --> 01:09:23.534
Echo!

1360
01:09:23.568 --> 01:09:26.436
You're supposed to
be our daughter!


1361
01:09:26.470 --> 01:09:28.472
- I am not your daughter!

1362
01:09:28.506 --> 01:09:31.109
(dramatic music)

1363
01:09:31.141 --> 01:09:32.275
- Don't say that.

1364
01:09:34.512 --> 01:09:35.580
Come to mama.

1365
01:09:37.649 --> 01:09:39.249
- You are not my mother!

1366
01:09:39.282 --> 01:09:41.119
You took me from her.

1367
01:09:41.151 --> 01:09:43.420
(eerie music)

1368
01:09:43.453 --> 01:09:47.558
- Yes, I am your mama,

1369
01:09:47.592 --> 01:09:50.895
and that, that's your papa!

1370
01:09:52.664 --> 01:09:53.865
We love you.

1371
01:09:55.066 --> 01:09:56.199
- No, no!

1372
01:09:56.233 --> 01:09:58.235
You had your dim-witted,
brain-washed sons


1373
01:09:58.268 --> 01:10:00.004
murder my parents!

1374
01:10:01.706 --> 01:10:06.243
- Miserable, ungrateful
little bitch!


1375
01:10:06.276 --> 01:10:08.513
(hammer squelching)

1376
01:10:08.546 --> 01:10:11.816
(dramatic music)

1377
01:10:11.849 --> 01:10:13.718
I thought you loved me!

1378
01:10:13.751 --> 01:10:16.587
(hammer pounding)

1379
01:10:26.964 --> 01:10:27.865
- Mom? Dad?

1380
01:10:34.438 --> 01:10:35.272
Dad?

1381
01:10:36.874 --> 01:10:39.644
(dramatic music)

1382
01:10:41.445 --> 01:10:42.513
Jesus Christ!

1383
01:10:43.748 --> 01:10:44.582
No!

1384
01:10:45.750 --> 01:10:46.584
No!

1385
01:10:48.619 --> 01:10:51.489
No, Dad, Dad, Dad,
Dad, Dad, Dad, Dad!


1386
01:10:52.590 --> 01:10:53.356
No!

1387
01:10:54.492 --> 01:10:56.060
No, Dad!

1388
01:10:56.094 --> 01:11:00.598
I love you. No.

1389
01:11:00.631 --> 01:11:02.934
No, no, no, no, no, no, Mom.

1390
01:11:05.069 --> 01:11:05.870
No!

1391
01:11:06.871 --> 01:11:07.672
Echo!

1392
01:11:10.407 --> 01:11:11.609
They loved you!

1393
01:11:12.810 --> 01:11:13.978
And you killed them.

1394
01:11:14.011 --> 01:11:16.481
(eerie music)

1395
01:11:17.447 --> 01:11:20.051
- They took everything from me.

1396
01:11:24.122 --> 01:11:26.456
You took everything from me!

1397
01:11:29.727 --> 01:11:32.730
(suspenseful music)

1398
01:11:42.540 --> 01:11:44.142
- We killed your brother,

1399
01:11:44.175 --> 01:11:46.511
and now we're gonna kill you.

1400
01:11:46.544 --> 01:11:50.047
(Lou and Jasper laughing)

1401
01:11:51.949 --> 01:11:54.552
(Lou laughing)

1402
01:11:56.587 --> 01:11:58.656
- See you in hell, Lou.

1403
01:11:58.689 --> 01:12:01.259
(Lou laughing)

1404
01:12:23.147 --> 01:12:25.716
(gentle music)

1405
01:12:31.255 --> 01:12:34.592
(train whistle blowing)

1406
01:12:40.998 --> 01:12:41.999
- Come on, guys.

1407
01:12:42.033 --> 01:12:43.366
It's our last day of camp.

1408
01:12:43.400 --> 01:12:44.367
Come on.

1409

(campers clapping)

1411
01:12:48.105 --> 01:12:51.042
- Yeah, you guys
still got to die.


1412
01:12:51.075 --> 01:12:52.076
- Don't worry.

1413
01:12:52.109 --> 01:12:53.277
You'll get your show.

1414
01:12:54.712 --> 01:12:58.783
- [Jasper] Hey, you all came
to camp to hear the story


1415
01:12:58.816 --> 01:13:01.152
of Echo Meadows and her family.

1416
01:13:01.185 --> 01:13:02.153
Am I right?

1417
01:13:02.186 --> 01:13:03.020
- [All] Yeah!

1418
01:13:04.387 --> 01:13:08.092

all paid big money


1419
01:13:08.125 --> 01:13:12.395
to see a Camp of
Terror live show?


1420
01:13:12.429 --> 01:13:13.430
- Yeah!
- Yes, we did.


1421
01:13:14.899 --> 01:13:19.871
- [Jasper] Sit back, relax,
and enjoy the closing act.


1422
01:13:22.073 --> 01:13:23.174
- Mike?

1423
01:13:23.207 --> 01:13:25.109
- Holy shit!

1424
01:13:25.142 --> 01:13:26.477
- I thought he was dead.

1425
01:13:26.510 --> 01:13:28.913
- Oh ho, that's what
I'm talkin' about.


1426
01:13:28.946 --> 01:13:31.949
(suspenseful music)

1427
01:13:32.884 --> 01:13:33.951

1428
01:13:35.686 --> 01:13:40.558

1431
01:13:45.395 --> 01:13:46.230
Run! Run!

1432
01:13:47.397 --> 01:13:48.299
Jasper Meadows!

1433
01:13:48.332 --> 01:13:49.867
Jasper Meadows is a killer!

1434
01:13:49.901 --> 01:13:51.002
He's a killer!

1435

(campers talking)

1436
01:13:52.370 --> 01:13:54.238

1437
01:13:54.272 --> 01:13:56.207
- Ooh, Jasper's
gonna get you, Mike.


1438

He's gonna get you, ooh.

(Mike screaming)

1440
01:13:58.843 --> 01:14:00.077
- This is boring.

1441
01:14:00.111 --> 01:14:01.545
Kill him already!

1442
01:14:01.579 --> 01:14:03.314

1446
01:14:16.694 --> 01:14:17.460
It's him!

1447
01:14:17.495 --> 01:14:18.296
It's really him!

1448
01:14:18.329 --> 01:14:19.130
He's alive!

1449
01:14:19.163 --> 01:14:19.964

1450
01:14:19.997 --> 01:14:22.800
(Mike screaming)

1451
01:14:25.836 --> 01:14:28.639
- You're in on this too?

1452
01:14:28.673 --> 01:14:31.342
- You don't remember me, do you?

1453
01:14:33.811 --> 01:14:35.046
- What an idiot.

1454

(dramatic music)

1455
01:14:38.316 --> 01:14:41.986
(campers laughing)

1456
01:14:42.019 --> 01:14:43.721

supposed to be happy?


1457
01:14:43.754 --> 01:14:46.257
(eerie music)

1458
01:14:49.961 --> 01:14:51.762

(suspenseful music)

1460
01:14:55.766 --> 01:14:56.567

01:14:56.600 --> 01:14:57.435
Ooh!

1462
01:14:59.770 --> 01:15:00.771
Ugh.

(operatic dramatic music)

1464
01:15:06.410 --> 01:15:07.745

1465
01:15:13.851 --> 01:15:14.785
- Encore!

1466
01:15:14.819 --> 01:15:17.021

Ugh.

01:15:36.674 --> 01:15:38.109
Ugh!

1477
01:15:38.142 --> 01:15:39.877
Fuck you.

1484
01:15:55.760 --> 01:15:56.927
- Yeah!
- Yeah!


1485
01:16:00.598 --> 01:16:01.966
- Hey, hey, hey!

1486
01:16:04.168 --> 01:16:06.404
You know what I hate
more than counselors?


1487
01:16:06.437 --> 01:16:07.772
- What?

1488
01:16:07.805 --> 01:16:09.073
- Fuckin' reporters!

1489
01:16:09.106 --> 01:16:12.610
(operatic dramatic music)

1490
01:16:13.878 --> 01:16:15.813
- I'm the last to die.

1491
01:16:15.846 --> 01:16:17.048
- Wrong!

1492
01:16:17.081 --> 01:16:17.915
Mike is.

1493
01:16:28.859 --> 01:16:31.429
(Jasper yells)

1494
01:16:35.766 --> 01:16:37.968

01:16:58.656 --> 01:17:01.493
(Jasper laughing)

1498
01:17:04.662 --> 01:17:07.431
(Jasper yelling)

1499
01:17:09.800 --> 01:17:11.869
(Mike whimpering)

1500
01:17:11.902 --> 01:17:14.839
(threatening music)

1501
01:17:27.418 --> 01:17:28.752
- Let me go, please.

1502
01:17:28.786 --> 01:17:30.354
- Shut the fuck up!

1503
01:17:31.355 --> 01:17:33.290
- I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

1504
01:17:34.191 --> 01:17:35.092
Help! Help!

1505
01:17:38.629 --> 01:17:39.463
Help!

1506
01:17:41.732 --> 01:17:42.933
I'm sorry, I swear.

1507
01:17:42.967 --> 01:17:44.368
I swear, I swear I
won't say anything.


1508
01:17:44.401 --> 01:17:45.202
I swear I won't say anything.

1509
01:17:45.236 --> 01:17:46.036
Let me go.

1510
01:17:46.070 --> 01:17:47.104
Let me go, please.

1511
01:17:47.138 --> 01:17:48.806
- Real good at that.
- Help!


1512
01:17:48.839 --> 01:17:50.975
- Real fucking good at that.

1513
01:17:51.008 --> 01:17:53.077
(suspenseful music)

1514
01:17:53.110 --> 01:17:54.645
- Help!

1515
01:17:54.678 --> 01:17:55.514
Help!

1516
01:17:56.581 --> 01:17:57.748
Help!

1517
01:17:57.781 --> 01:17:59.283
Help!

1518
01:17:59.316 --> 01:18:00.885
Please!

1519
01:18:00.918 --> 01:18:01.919
I'm sorry, please.

1520
01:18:03.287 --> 01:18:04.722
Help!

1521
01:18:04.755 --> 01:18:05.590
Help!

1522
01:18:06.790 --> 01:18:07.858
We were only kids.

1523
01:18:07.892 --> 01:18:09.093
We were only kids.

1524
01:18:09.126 --> 01:18:09.927
We were only kids.

1525
01:18:09.960 --> 01:18:11.162
- You had your chance.

1526
01:18:11.195 --> 01:18:12.997
You said nothing!
- We were kids.


1527
01:18:13.030 --> 01:18:13.831
We were kids.

1528
01:18:13.864 --> 01:18:14.599
We were kids.

1529
01:18:14.633 --> 01:18:15.432
Help!

1530
01:18:15.466 --> 01:18:16.300
Help!

1531
01:18:17.434 --> 01:18:18.269
- Yeah?

1532
01:18:19.403 --> 01:18:20.738
So was she.

1533
01:18:20.771 --> 01:18:23.774
(threatening music)

1534
01:18:24.643 --> 01:18:27.411
(Mike screaming)

1535
01:18:34.351 --> 01:18:35.152
Shut up!

1536
01:18:35.186 --> 01:18:36.687
Shut the fuck up!

1537
01:18:36.720 --> 01:18:39.390
(knife jabbing)

1538
01:18:40.925 --> 01:18:43.562
(blood pouring)

1539
01:18:43.595 --> 01:18:46.163
(Jasper yells)

1540
01:18:48.533 --> 01:18:49.366
Ugh.

1541
01:18:54.772 --> 01:18:58.108
(train whistle blowing)

1542
01:19:00.711 --> 01:19:03.881
(intense eerie music)

1543
01:19:16.126 --> 01:19:17.194
- We're finally here.

1544
01:19:18.929 --> 01:19:21.098
- We're finally off
that shitty bus.


1545
01:19:22.266 --> 01:19:23.300
- You'd think the
Rutherfords would have


1546
01:19:23.334 --> 01:19:24.802
a more comfortable bus.

1547
01:19:24.835 --> 01:19:27.471
But I guess the rich
get richer for a reason.


1548
01:19:27.505 --> 01:19:29.840
- Ah, come on, this
is gonna be awesome.


1549
01:19:29.873 --> 01:19:31.543
- I wonder who's
gonna die first.


1550
01:19:31.576 --> 01:19:32.743
- Her.

1551
01:19:32.776 --> 01:19:35.112
- Yeah, the bimbo
always gets it first.


1552
01:19:35.145 --> 01:19:36.481
- It's always the stoner.
(camera snapping)


1553
01:19:36.514 --> 01:19:38.415
- You guys are way off.

1554
01:19:38.449 --> 01:19:41.218
(dramatic music)

1555
01:19:51.829 --> 01:19:53.430
- Man, you scared everybody off.

1556
01:19:53.464 --> 01:19:54.965
- Not everyone.

1557
01:19:54.999 --> 01:19:56.233
- Do you see that?

1558
01:19:56.267 --> 01:19:57.067
Over there.

1559
01:19:57.101 --> 01:19:58.002
- Yes, I do.

1560
01:19:58.035 --> 01:19:59.870
- No, no, over there, the ones.

1561
01:19:59.903 --> 01:20:01.905
- There it is indeed.

1562
01:20:01.939 --> 01:20:03.407
- Loser.

1563
01:20:03.440 --> 01:20:06.176
(dramatic music)

1564
01:20:14.018 --> 01:20:17.254
Who the fuck are you?

1565
01:20:17.288 --> 01:20:18.856
Great, another loser.

1566
01:20:18.889 --> 01:20:19.691
Ow!

1567
01:20:19.724 --> 01:20:22.226
(eerie music)

1568
01:20:23.093 --> 01:20:25.764
You used to hide in the group.

1569
01:20:25.796 --> 01:20:29.466
And now I have you all alone.

1570
01:20:29.501 --> 01:20:33.237
All alone! (laughing)

1571
01:20:33.270 --> 01:20:36.273
(camper whimpering)

1572
01:20:41.278 --> 01:20:42.079
- [Camper] Help!

1573
01:20:42.112 --> 01:20:43.280
- Help!

1574
01:20:43.314 --> 01:20:44.882
Help!

1575
01:20:44.915 --> 01:20:45.750

Oh, no!

Oh, no!

1579
01:20:51.088 --> 01:20:51.922
Oh, no!

1580
01:20:59.531 --> 01:21:00.331
Ha ha!

1581
01:21:15.079 --> 01:21:15.913
- Hello?

1582
01:21:18.483 --> 01:21:19.316
Holy shit.

1583
01:21:23.788 --> 01:21:26.023
I don't remember this cabin.

1584
01:21:26.056 --> 01:21:26.890
Holy crap.

1585
01:21:28.359 --> 01:21:29.360
That's cool.

1586
01:21:30.861 --> 01:21:33.698
(camera snapping)

1587
01:21:34.865 --> 01:21:35.700
Oh, cool.

1588
01:21:42.339 --> 01:21:43.173
Cool.

1589
01:21:45.242 --> 01:21:48.078
(camera snapping)

1590
01:21:58.523 --> 01:21:59.923
Nice touch.

1591
01:21:59.957 --> 01:22:02.926
(threatening music)

1592
01:22:06.498 --> 01:22:08.332

Jeez!

(eerie music)

1594
01:22:14.071 --> 01:22:14.905
Oh, you're.

1595
01:22:16.808 --> 01:22:18.543
What's wrong?

1596
01:22:18.576 --> 01:22:21.646
(Echo humming)

1597
01:22:21.679 --> 01:22:23.548
What's wrong with you?

1598
01:22:23.581 --> 01:22:26.183
(Echo humming)

1599
01:22:26.216 --> 01:22:27.852
What the fuck is
wrong with you, huh?


1600
01:22:29.788 --> 01:22:31.355
Mm.

1601
01:22:31.388 --> 01:22:32.222
Mm.

1602
01:22:35.593 --> 01:22:37.995
You should smile more.

1603
01:22:38.028 --> 01:22:38.863
Bitch.

1604
01:22:40.431 --> 01:22:41.599
- You are all the same.

1605
01:22:44.435 --> 01:22:46.270
You don't remember me, do you?

1606
01:22:48.405 --> 01:22:51.308
(campers laughing)

1607
01:22:52.544 --> 01:22:53.377
- No.

1608
01:23:00.451 --> 01:23:01.285
Hey.

1609
01:23:08.992 --> 01:23:10.027
Shit.

1610
01:23:10.060 --> 01:23:11.462
Okay, okay, okay.

1611
01:23:16.366 --> 01:23:17.167
Ugh!

1612
01:23:17.201 --> 01:23:18.068

(eerie music)

1615
01:23:40.592 --> 01:23:42.359
- It's gonna be okay.

1616
01:23:46.196 --> 01:23:48.933
The new campers are here.

1617
01:23:48.967 --> 01:23:50.802
- You know what we have
to do, little brother.
