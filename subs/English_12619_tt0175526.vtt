1
00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:41.527
In my planet, the women are barren.

2
00:00:43.945 --> 00:00:45.996
I traveled secretly...

3
00:00:46.156 --> 00:00:49.456
across the depths of space,
assuming human form...


4
00:00:51.912 --> 00:00:54.540
so I'd may came to know earthly women...

5
00:00:54.748 --> 00:00:57.251
and repopulate my desolated planet.

6
00:01:00.545 --> 00:01:04.470
I wish for you to know
my true name. Xunobulax.


7
00:01:05.008 --> 00:01:07.890
- Xunobulax?
- Yeah.


8
00:01:09.513 --> 00:01:11.481
Our race makes love just once.

9
00:01:13.392 --> 00:01:17.272
We put all our cosmic energy
into that one explosive... act...


10
00:01:19.523 --> 00:01:22.117
and then, like your terrestrial mayfly...

11
00:01:22.984 --> 00:01:25.658
we die of a sweet early content.

12
00:01:27.155 --> 00:01:29.954
I want to make love to you
in the manner of my people.


13
00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:33.746
I want it to be my last act.

14
00:01:34.371 --> 00:01:36.874
Keep that up, Rod, and it will be
your last act.


15
00:01:37.332 --> 00:01:39.426
I can't return home without
accomplishing my mission.


16
00:01:39.626 --> 00:01:41.299
I said stop!

17
00:01:47.718 --> 00:01:50.769
- I want my first time to be with you.
- And so do I.


18
00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:54.433
Cool, I understand. Please, Stacy.

19
00:02:17.581 --> 00:02:19.254
What the fuck is this?

20
00:02:25.172 --> 00:02:26.515
Hold on.

21
00:02:30.343 --> 00:02:33.392
Ben! Get your ass over here!

22
00:02:34.848 --> 00:02:36.850
Mark, is that you in there?

23
00:02:45.901 --> 00:02:47.244
This isn't funny!

24
00:02:49.237 --> 00:02:50.534
What the hell...

25
00:02:52.908 --> 00:02:54.330
Rod!

26
00:02:59.247 --> 00:03:00.624
No! Rod!

27
00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:19.977
Stacy...

28
00:03:23.146 --> 00:03:24.568
Stacy...

29
00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:34.783
Stacy!

30
00:03:40.622 --> 00:03:42.169
Stacy!

31
00:03:53.218 --> 00:03:54.595
No! Rod!

32
00:03:56.388 --> 00:03:57.605
Oh, my God!

33
00:04:35.302 --> 00:04:38.602
I was supposed to
be home 15 minutes ago.

34
00:04:38.889 --> 00:04:41.642
Sixth graders can stay out
later than you can.


35
00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:50.613
No, baby, come on...

36
00:04:51.109 --> 00:04:53.703
No, no, no, no... No.

37
00:04:54.112 --> 00:04:55.079
No.

38
00:04:57.782 --> 00:04:59.375
Mmm... Stop.

39
00:05:00.577 --> 00:05:03.296
Doesn't it ever bother you
you could die a virgin?


40
00:05:03.496 --> 00:05:06.959
Yeah. It's right up there
with global warming.


41
00:05:14.215 --> 00:05:16.718
I think we should start
seeing other people.


42
00:05:16.927 --> 00:05:18.019
What?

43
00:05:19.179 --> 00:05:21.655
Look... we've been dating
for about a year,


44
00:05:21.855 --> 00:05:24.906
and I really don't think
it's working out. All right?


45
00:05:33.401 --> 00:05:35.449
- Hi, Mrs. Marken.
- You two having fun?


46
00:05:35.654 --> 00:05:37.156
Hi, Mom.

47
00:05:37.489 --> 00:05:40.743
Kenny, you wouldn't happen to
have a cigarette for me, would ya?


48
00:05:42.494 --> 00:05:43.761
Sure.

49
00:05:46.289 --> 00:05:49.509
Mrs. Marken, smoking's really bad for you.

50
00:05:51.127 --> 00:05:52.674
Ah...

51
00:05:52.879 --> 00:05:54.802
The industrial strength.

52
00:05:58.343 --> 00:05:59.720
I owe you.

53
00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:02.393
I'm going to have to smoke this here.

54
00:06:02.931 --> 00:06:05.354
Brent doesn't like me
to smoke in the house.


55
00:06:07.435 --> 00:06:11.440
- It's my last guilty pleasure.
- Is Dad still up?


56
00:06:11.982 --> 00:06:15.361
- My, we're out late tonight, huh?
- Kenny was just leaving.


57
00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:17.787
Too bad.

58
00:06:22.659 --> 00:06:25.001
It looks like the coast is clear.

59
00:06:25.161 --> 00:06:27.459
If you want to beat the heat,
you better hurry up.


60
00:06:29.791 --> 00:06:32.168
- Mrs. Marken?
- Mm-hmm.


61
00:06:33.503 --> 00:06:36.256
- Your headlights are on.
- Very observant.


62
00:06:37.090 --> 00:06:40.552
- Thanks. Good night.
- Good night.


63
00:06:49.602 --> 00:06:51.821
So, is this goodbye or good night?

64
00:06:52.939 --> 00:06:54.236
Pick one.

65
00:06:55.442 --> 00:06:57.661
- Pick one.
- I think it's up to you.


66
00:07:08.246 --> 00:07:10.465
Don't... slam the door!

67
00:07:26.056 --> 00:07:28.275
Like a little tiny mouse.

68
00:07:28.475 --> 00:07:29.476
Ssh.

69
00:07:31.352 --> 00:07:33.275
- Good night.
- Good night.


70
00:08:02.884 --> 00:08:05.143
- Do you know what time it is?
- Daddy, don't scare me like that.


71
00:08:05.303 --> 00:08:07.305
You're grounded the next two
Friday nights.


72
00:08:07.514 --> 00:08:09.516
Most 6th graders stay out
later than I can.


73
00:08:09.724 --> 00:08:11.476
They're not the sheriff's daughter.

74
00:08:35.542 --> 00:08:37.135
Marken.

75
00:08:40.630 --> 00:08:43.224
Alright, I'll get down there
as soon as I can.


76
00:09:00.316 --> 00:09:01.693
Daddy.

77
00:09:31.514 --> 00:09:34.393
- You're the only one here?
- First on the scene.


78
00:09:34.601 --> 00:09:37.024
The forensics and homicide
are on their way from Richmond.


79
00:09:37.228 --> 00:09:40.607
That's the victim's car.
It's covered in blood, Sheriff.


80
00:09:44.611 --> 00:09:48.616
Over here, I found the boy
faced down in the water...


81
00:09:48.907 --> 00:09:51.751
with about a million stab wounds.
And the girl...


82
00:09:53.203 --> 00:09:55.376
Well, nailed to a tree.

83
00:09:56.080 --> 00:09:59.334
A lot of blood pumped out of
her wounds, which means...


84
00:09:59.542 --> 00:10:03.467
Which means all this was done
to her while she was still alive.


85
00:10:28.821 --> 00:10:29.743
Jody, doll... listen...

86
00:10:29.948 --> 00:10:32.326
I'm trying to pump out a special
edition of the paper before lunchtime.


87
00:10:32.533 --> 00:10:34.001
And if you tell me all that you know,
I'll be your best friend...


88
00:10:34.202 --> 00:10:36.920
your very, very best friend... and
you can be co-editor of the paper,


89
00:10:37.121 --> 00:10:38.338
and apply to all those Ivy League schools

90
00:10:38.539 --> 00:10:40.912
with those young marriageable boys.
What do ya think?


91
00:10:41.084 --> 00:10:42.631
Don't be silent like that. No, no, no.

92
00:10:42.835 --> 00:10:45.881
I want you to talk to your dad and snoop
dog for me. You know what I'm saying?


93
00:10:46.089 --> 00:10:48.512
Timmy, I don't have a clue
what you're talking about.


94
00:10:49.425 --> 00:10:51.302
You haven't heard about Rod and Stacy?

95
00:10:51.511 --> 00:10:54.606
Are you already taking footnotes for
your pathetic little gossip column?


96
00:10:55.098 --> 00:10:58.272
- Did they break up?
- Break up? Wake up, they're dead!


97
00:10:58.476 --> 00:11:00.649
They flatlined, they shuffled
off the mortal coil,


98
00:11:00.853 --> 00:11:04.115
they croaked, and gone
to see their maker. Duh...


99
00:11:04.315 --> 00:11:06.067
How can you be so critically uninformed?

100
00:11:06.276 --> 00:11:08.779
Will you look, the whole school is
buzzing with that music.


101
00:11:13.658 --> 00:11:18.170
Look! Maybe there's something for my
incredibly pathetic gossip column after all.


102
00:11:19.747 --> 00:11:21.670
Like I'm not paying attention.

103
00:11:23.584 --> 00:11:26.258
Mr. Sisler, Sheriff Marken's
here to see you, sir.


104
00:11:26.462 --> 00:11:31.058
- Shall I bring him in?
- Yeah. Thank you, Diana.


105
00:11:36.931 --> 00:11:39.810
- Oh, Brent. It's been a while.
- Tom.


106
00:11:47.358 --> 00:11:49.736
I don't need to tell you what
an uproar the school is in.


107
00:11:50.153 --> 00:11:52.326
I canceled all the regular
classes for the day and...


108
00:11:52.864 --> 00:11:55.788
asked the teachers to
counsel and console the kids.


109
00:11:55.992 --> 00:11:59.872
I know there are professionals
for these sorts of situations, but...


110
00:12:00.872 --> 00:12:03.420
- I thought it'd be best coming from...
- Listen, Tom.


111
00:12:03.624 --> 00:12:07.174
I'm to have to stop by some of your
classes... to ask a few questions.


112
00:12:08.588 --> 00:12:10.761
I'd like to start with the ones
those two kids attended.


113
00:12:11.466 --> 00:12:13.685
Naturally, you're all horrified...

114
00:12:13.885 --> 00:12:16.809
by the sudden senseless loss
of your classmates.


115
00:12:17.513 --> 00:12:20.953
Perhaps some of you feel guilty that
you weren't nicer to Rod and Stacey


116
00:12:21.154 --> 00:12:24.020
while they were alive
or maybe you're... I don't know...


117
00:12:24.228 --> 00:12:27.482
haunted by something unpleasant
you might have said to one of them.


118
00:12:28.483 --> 00:12:31.908
Once, in the 8th grade,
I had a fight with Rod...


119
00:12:32.111 --> 00:12:34.830
And I told him
to fuck off and die!

120
00:12:41.454 --> 00:12:43.081
Hey, come on, guys.

121
00:12:45.291 --> 00:12:46.793
It's alright, Heather.

122
00:12:49.420 --> 00:12:54.095
Maybe we'll all feel better if we talk
about our lost classmates and how we feel.


123
00:12:55.760 --> 00:12:58.639
Mark, you were friends with Rod.
Do you want to say something?


124
00:13:00.431 --> 00:13:02.354
Oh, man...

125
00:13:04.852 --> 00:13:06.980
I don't know, I'm just...

126
00:13:08.106 --> 00:13:10.063
Thank you, Mark.

127
00:13:14.320 --> 00:13:15.913
How about you, Sandy?

128
00:13:17.990 --> 00:13:19.282
Sandy!

129
00:13:19.826 --> 00:13:21.919
Oh, um... I... I, uh...

130
00:13:22.286 --> 00:13:24.755
I guess at times like this...

131
00:13:25.581 --> 00:13:27.174
I just hope there's a heaven.

132
00:13:27.834 --> 00:13:29.081
Lame.

133
00:13:30.503 --> 00:13:31.800
Cindy, come on.

134
00:13:32.338 --> 00:13:35.558
I think it's important in times like this
we offer each other some support.


135
00:13:35.967 --> 00:13:40.059
I'd like to offer the killer's ass some
support in the fucking electric chair.


136
00:13:42.807 --> 00:13:44.229
That's a legitimate reaction,

137
00:13:44.434 --> 00:13:47.942
unfortunately, the means of execution in
this state happens to be lethal injection.


138
00:13:48.855 --> 00:13:53.156
Ben, I know you have a very different
point of view regarding this tragedy.


139
00:13:53.359 --> 00:13:54.360
So...

140
00:13:56.821 --> 00:13:58.038
Go ahead.

141
00:13:58.698 --> 00:14:01.916
Well, I would like to know whether
this killer...


142
00:14:02.076 --> 00:14:06.627
removed any body parts, or sexually
defiled any orifice of either victims.


143
00:14:07.081 --> 00:14:08.424
You're tragically sick.

144
00:14:08.791 --> 00:14:10.509
I wanna know, because if he didn't,

145
00:14:10.710 --> 00:14:13.554
I'm starting to think this loser
deserves a thumbs down.


146
00:14:13.754 --> 00:14:15.722
How can you be so insensitive?

147
00:14:15.923 --> 00:14:19.682
And you're like Mother Teresa?
You're the one told Rod to drop dead.


148
00:14:19.886 --> 00:14:22.309
You're only fooling yourself with this
display of indifference.


149
00:14:22.513 --> 00:14:25.813
Hey, Jackhole, you're not playing
Death Quake now, this is the real world!


150
00:14:26.058 --> 00:14:27.359
Fuck you.

151
00:14:27.602 --> 00:14:31.818
This is Ben's pathetic concept of cool,
He has to pretend he's not afraid.


152
00:14:32.023 --> 00:14:34.196
Well, hello Cindy Freud!

153
00:14:34.400 --> 00:14:36.152
What's your concept of cool, doc?

154
00:14:36.360 --> 00:14:39.284
Bang the entire senior class
starting with "A"?


155
00:14:39.489 --> 00:14:42.618
If I'm so all used up then, why do
you try to hook me up nonstop?


156
00:14:42.825 --> 00:14:46.959
- I find experience attractive!
- Alright, shut up now, would you please?


157
00:14:47.163 --> 00:14:49.165
Everyone! Jesus!

158
00:14:49.749 --> 00:14:51.672
What is wrong with you people?

159
00:14:53.377 --> 00:14:54.974
Jody...

160
00:14:55.171 --> 00:14:59.017
certainly I can count on you to say
something singularly constructive.


161
00:15:02.220 --> 00:15:03.267
Dad?

162
00:15:04.013 --> 00:15:06.937
Please excuse the intrusion,
Mr. Marliston,


163
00:15:07.141 --> 00:15:09.360
but Sheriff Marken would like
to address the class.


164
00:15:09.602 --> 00:15:12.946
Hi, Sheriff... Leonard Marliston.
It's a pleasure to meet you, sir.


165
00:15:13.147 --> 00:15:14.864
Likewise.

166
00:15:15.024 --> 00:15:17.618
Class, please give your attention
to Sheriff Marken.


167
00:15:19.445 --> 00:15:22.619
Two of your fellow students,
Rod Harper and Stacy Twelfmann...


168
00:15:22.823 --> 00:15:24.541
were murdered last night at the falls...

169
00:15:24.742 --> 00:15:27.621
by a person or persons unknown,
in a cold-blooded fashion.


170
00:15:29.247 --> 00:15:32.672
The reason I came here was to ask
you, as friends and good citizens...


171
00:15:32.875 --> 00:15:34.798
to come forward to me or my staff...

172
00:15:35.002 --> 00:15:37.801
with any information you might have
concerning this terrible crime.


173
00:15:38.548 --> 00:15:41.392
- Is there a suspect yet, Sheriff?
- No.


174
00:15:41.592 --> 00:15:43.594
Well, is there any other
information you can give us?


175
00:15:43.803 --> 00:15:46.272
I'm not at liberty to discuss
the case any further.


176
00:15:48.516 --> 00:15:51.065
Well, Sheriff, Plato says that
polis can only remain healthy


177
00:15:51.269 --> 00:15:53.112
if truth is available to all citizens.

178
00:15:55.106 --> 00:15:59.865
Well, Plato can give out all details he
wants when he's the sheriff of this town.


179
00:16:03.155 --> 00:16:05.032
He's doing it deliberately.

180
00:16:05.950 --> 00:16:07.372
Of course he is.

181
00:16:07.952 --> 00:16:10.296
All the more reason
why you should ignore it.


182
00:16:10.871 --> 00:16:12.748
Do you think she goes all the way?

183
00:16:17.920 --> 00:16:19.012
Doubt it.

184
00:16:20.006 --> 00:16:21.258
Who'd want to fuck her?

185
00:16:24.594 --> 00:16:25.811
Look.

186
00:16:42.778 --> 00:16:44.121
Shit.

187
00:16:44.572 --> 00:16:45.949
Stop throwing shit!

188
00:16:46.157 --> 00:16:48.285
- Fuck you!
- Jesus Christ!


189
00:16:52.163 --> 00:16:54.962
Okay now, I am done with relationships...

190
00:16:55.166 --> 00:16:58.044
but I see a hope for you.
Come on. Come on.


191
00:16:58.252 --> 00:17:01.047
- No, Jody, no.
- Come on. It's sad and pathetic.


192
00:17:01.255 --> 00:17:03.303
You watch him eat every single day
and you never talk to him.


193
00:17:03.507 --> 00:17:06.644
My parents have been married for 25 years
and all they do is watch TV.


194
00:17:06.844 --> 00:17:08.266
Come on, you're going to go.
You're going to talk to him.


195
00:17:08.471 --> 00:17:09.688
You don't want to make a scene!

196
00:17:17.813 --> 00:17:19.315
How are you doing?

197
00:17:22.610 --> 00:17:25.113
It's a pretty freaky day today, isn't it.

198
00:17:25.321 --> 00:17:26.743
Yeah, I guess so.

199
00:17:38.376 --> 00:17:40.003
You shit sucking liar!

200
00:17:41.379 --> 00:17:42.926
I'm gonna kill you!

201
00:17:43.881 --> 00:17:45.640
Better than a cock-sucking liar!

202
00:17:45.800 --> 00:17:47.427
I'll kill you, you little shit!

203
00:17:50.638 --> 00:17:52.311
What's going on here?

204
00:17:56.686 --> 00:17:59.314
It's a compliment when a guy
says you can suck good dick.


205
00:18:01.565 --> 00:18:03.363
You got something on your mouth there.

206
00:18:04.276 --> 00:18:07.075
- He's lying to everyone about me!
- Tell me about it in the office!


207
00:18:08.948 --> 00:18:10.575
Hey, hey!
What's your phone number, Annette?


208
00:18:11.742 --> 00:18:13.244
No, it was someone, not me.

209
00:18:15.830 --> 00:18:17.002
What's up with that?

210
00:18:17.206 --> 00:18:19.584
Dylan's been telling people
Annette gave him a hummer.


211
00:18:20.584 --> 00:18:22.552
- Did she?
- Are you kidding?


212
00:18:22.753 --> 00:18:24.005
No.

213
00:18:24.213 --> 00:18:26.762
She thinks fellatio is a
character in Shakespeare.


214
00:18:27.258 --> 00:18:30.048
She wouldn't know a dick
if its name was Woody.


215
00:18:32.138 --> 00:18:33.515
That's funny.

216
00:18:34.014 --> 00:18:36.437
What do you think, Mark?

217
00:18:36.976 --> 00:18:38.272
Huh?

218
00:18:38.602 --> 00:18:41.025
I think these ribs rule.

219
00:19:03.335 --> 00:19:05.429
Come on, honey, we're late.

220
00:19:07.131 --> 00:19:08.553
- Hi, handsome.
- Hi.


221
00:19:25.024 --> 00:19:26.196
Here we go.

222
00:19:27.443 --> 00:19:29.946
Hello. Come here handsome.

223
00:19:30.321 --> 00:19:31.823
Good to see you!

224
00:19:37.953 --> 00:19:39.529
Who is it?

225
00:19:39.914 --> 00:19:42.754
- Hi, Annette?
- Yeah?


226
00:19:42.958 --> 00:19:46.257
- It's Loralee Sherman.
- Excuse me?


227
00:19:46.462 --> 00:19:50.140
Loralee Sherman. 
Is your mom home?

228
00:19:50.341 --> 00:19:51.617
Uh...

229
00:19:52.551 --> 00:19:53.726
No.

230
00:19:53.886 --> 00:19:57.306
- She didn't tell you I was coming by?
- No.


231
00:19:57.723 --> 00:20:01.227
I must have just missed her.
Can I leave a note?


232
00:20:10.277 --> 00:20:12.245
Okay, just one second.

233
00:20:16.325 --> 00:20:18.498
Could you slip it through
the door, please?


234
00:20:37.263 --> 00:20:39.561
I think I'm ready for the run.

235
00:20:40.307 --> 00:20:42.560
Hey, hey, come on now.
What's the hurry, gorgeous?


236
00:20:43.477 --> 00:20:46.026
Slow down. Slow down.

237
00:20:53.404 --> 00:20:54.872
- Who left the door open?
- I don't know.


238
00:20:55.072 --> 00:20:56.995
- Annette?
- Annette?


239
00:20:58.242 --> 00:20:59.484
Annette!

240
00:20:59.702 --> 00:21:01.730
Annette!

241
00:21:09.503 --> 00:21:10.755
- Grab there...
- Okay.


242
00:21:10.963 --> 00:21:12.556
Grab underneath. 
Get a good grip, alright?

243
00:21:12.756 --> 00:21:16.351
Step through, let their weight and
their momentum take them over.


244
00:21:16.635 --> 00:21:18.696
- Okay.
- The most important thing is this grip.


245
00:21:18.896 --> 00:21:21.191
Latch on like a pitbull.

246
00:21:21.399 --> 00:21:23.146
Is there any way you
could give me some mace,


247
00:21:23.350 --> 00:21:25.444
or maybe a ray gun, stun gun, anything?

248
00:21:25.644 --> 00:21:27.612
No, it's against the law. Here I come.

249
00:21:32.568 --> 00:21:34.445
- Take 5, champ.
- Okay.


250
00:21:36.155 --> 00:21:37.452
Marken.

251
00:21:48.918 --> 00:21:51.171
Looks like we have
an encore performance, Sheriff.


252
00:21:53.589 --> 00:21:55.808
Agent Bronhill, this is
special agent Majestik.


253
00:21:57.301 --> 00:22:00.396
- Who was first on the scene?
- My deputy.


254
00:22:01.347 --> 00:22:03.315
I responded to the father's
call around 11:00 pm,


255
00:22:03.515 --> 00:22:05.734
notified the sheriff
immediately afterwards.


256
00:22:08.771 --> 00:22:10.193
We got this.

257
00:22:19.031 --> 00:22:21.159
We're in the big league now.

258
00:22:26.747 --> 00:22:28.624
As you can see
on the inside left thigh

259
00:22:28.832 --> 00:22:31.585
there's a one inch deep carving
of the word "virgin".


260
00:22:32.211 --> 00:22:34.088
The ones we found in all 3 victims.

261
00:22:34.922 --> 00:22:36.549
Like Stacy Twelfmann...

262
00:22:36.757 --> 00:22:39.476
Annette DeWolde was in fact a virgin
at the time of death.


263
00:22:40.552 --> 00:22:44.227
The hymen was intact. We found no
evidence of semen on the clothes...


264
00:22:44.431 --> 00:22:47.776
skin, hair, mouth, or the anus.

265
00:22:49.019 --> 00:22:52.023
No abrasions or contusions
in the pubic region.


266
00:22:52.439 --> 00:22:55.568
In fact no evidence of
sexual penetration of any kind.


267
00:22:56.819 --> 00:23:00.494
Neither was the boy we found
in the first killings sexually assaulted.


268
00:23:01.532 --> 00:23:04.502
Of course I can't tell you
if he died a virgin...


269
00:23:05.202 --> 00:23:09.252
but I can tell you that he did not
have sex at the time of the killings.


270
00:23:10.624 --> 00:23:12.376
It would appear...

271
00:23:12.584 --> 00:23:17.260
that your killer has been quite accurate
in the application of his signature.


272
00:23:27.266 --> 00:23:28.313
Come in.

273
00:23:33.147 --> 00:23:34.399
Hi, honey.

274
00:23:35.190 --> 00:23:36.407
Hi, Daddy.

275
00:23:37.067 --> 00:23:38.444
Listen...

276
00:23:38.944 --> 00:23:41.447
I need to ask you a personal question.

277
00:23:41.655 --> 00:23:43.703
About what?

278
00:23:43.907 --> 00:23:45.625
It's about you and Kenny.

279
00:23:46.618 --> 00:23:49.838
- What is it?
- About how far you've gone?


280
00:23:51.790 --> 00:23:52.882
Gone?

281
00:23:53.792 --> 00:23:54.964
Gone, you know...

282
00:23:56.378 --> 00:23:57.721
base wise.

283
00:23:58.881 --> 00:24:00.804
Are you two kissing?

284
00:24:01.884 --> 00:24:03.710
Of course.

285
00:24:05.345 --> 00:24:08.394
I'm not a child anymore, Dad.
That's normal.


286
00:24:08.599 --> 00:24:10.101
I'm not criticizing.

287
00:24:10.809 --> 00:24:12.231
I know. I know...

288
00:24:13.645 --> 00:24:15.647
Have you gone further than that?

289
00:24:18.734 --> 00:24:23.114
Listen, I wouldn't ask you this unless
it was absolutely necessary.


290
00:24:25.616 --> 00:24:29.746
Can you go further... than you have?

291
00:24:31.246 --> 00:24:32.372
Yes.

292
00:24:36.126 --> 00:24:38.879
No, no, but you don't have
to worry about it.


293
00:24:40.172 --> 00:24:41.094
Okay?

294
00:24:41.632 --> 00:24:43.885
We just broke up the other day.

295
00:24:45.719 --> 00:24:46.766
Yeah.

296
00:24:49.473 --> 00:24:52.522
Are you disappointed... Dad?

297
00:24:53.060 --> 00:24:54.107
Hm?

298
00:24:54.895 --> 00:24:57.364
Are you disappointed
that I'm still a virgin?


299
00:24:58.065 --> 00:25:01.194
No, no... not at all.

300
00:25:03.028 --> 00:25:04.075
Okay...

301
00:25:07.032 --> 00:25:09.831
I'm very, very, very proud of you.

302
00:25:14.623 --> 00:25:16.546
You're still my little girl.

303
00:25:21.255 --> 00:25:22.347
- Good night.
- Good night.


304
00:25:22.548 --> 00:25:23.765
I love you.

305
00:25:34.935 --> 00:25:37.609
Parents in our town need to know
what's really going on here.


306
00:25:38.188 --> 00:25:40.486
Does that mean revealing the signature?

307
00:25:40.691 --> 00:25:42.284
Yeah, I suppose it does.

308
00:25:42.693 --> 00:25:44.195
Textbooks say don't.

309
00:25:44.653 --> 00:25:47.497
It'll leave us no conclusive way
to verify the killer's confession.


310
00:25:47.698 --> 00:25:51.123
- It could also spur copycat crimes.
- This is different.


311
00:25:51.577 --> 00:25:54.330
This isn't a signature. 
It's a message.

312
00:25:54.872 --> 00:25:56.639
Message?

313
00:25:58.542 --> 00:26:00.636
I want you to set up an
emergency town meeting.


314
00:26:00.836 --> 00:26:02.930
Tonight at 6:00 pm.

315
00:26:03.130 --> 00:26:07.135
And I want every parent of every
teenager in town there. Do it.


316
00:26:09.178 --> 00:26:11.522
We don't have a
venue big enough for that.

317
00:26:11.972 --> 00:26:14.020
We'll use the gym at the high school.

318
00:26:14.808 --> 00:26:17.277
No kids. Not yet.

319
00:26:20.063 --> 00:26:22.566
There you are, Mr. Marliston.

320
00:26:22.774 --> 00:26:25.402
- Oh, Jody... Hi.
- Hi.


321
00:26:26.653 --> 00:26:29.998
I finished my T.S. Elliot paper.

322
00:26:30.324 --> 00:26:31.997
Great. Wow.

323
00:26:33.827 --> 00:26:36.455
I want you to know,
I really love his work.


324
00:26:36.663 --> 00:26:37.710
Good.

325
00:26:40.959 --> 00:26:45.214
"Alas, our dried voices
When we whisper together


326
00:26:46.423 --> 00:26:49.848
Are quiet and meaningless
As wind and dry grass


327
00:26:50.844 --> 00:26:55.270
Or rats feet over broken glass
In our dry cellar"


328
00:27:04.775 --> 00:27:09.747
Do you think that that's how it is
between people, Mr. Marliston?


329
00:27:10.405 --> 00:27:12.748
Everything dry...

330
00:27:12.908 --> 00:27:16.082
and meaningless and hopelessly empty?

331
00:27:18.038 --> 00:27:19.505
Um...

332
00:27:20.207 --> 00:27:22.130
I heard that you broke up with Kenny.

333
00:27:22.918 --> 00:27:27.139
What does that have to do with it?
I'm very over him.


334
00:27:28.548 --> 00:27:30.516
Do you think that any serious
thought that I have...


335
00:27:30.717 --> 00:27:33.766
is solely attributed to my one
misspent year with Kenny Ascot?


336
00:27:34.054 --> 00:27:36.773
No, I'm sorry. Jody, 
I'm... it's, uh...

337
00:27:38.517 --> 00:27:40.110
Oh, God...

338
00:27:41.603 --> 00:27:46.109
I'm sorry. I'm very embarrassed
that I just yelled at you.


339
00:27:46.358 --> 00:27:49.282
No, I... I'm really sorry,
it's none of my business.


340
00:27:56.868 --> 00:27:58.120
What's wrong?

341
00:27:58.996 --> 00:28:01.966
It's weird. I just saw
someone standing there.


342
00:28:05.544 --> 00:28:06.921
- Jody, no... Jody...
- What?


343
00:28:39.036 --> 00:28:40.037
Come out!

344
00:29:13.403 --> 00:29:15.872
- Anything?
- No, no.


345
00:29:16.490 --> 00:29:19.184
I guess we've spooked each other
pretty good, didn't we?


346
00:29:19.385 --> 00:29:21.157
Yeah...

347
00:29:21.461 --> 00:29:24.255
Come on, I have to go to this meeting
your father organized.


348
00:29:32.381 --> 00:29:34.099
- Are you gonna be alright?
- Yeah.


349
00:29:34.466 --> 00:29:36.560
- Hey, Mr. Marliston?
- Yeah?


350
00:29:36.760 --> 00:29:37.852
Um...

351
00:29:38.387 --> 00:29:40.355
Can we talk again sometime?

352
00:29:40.555 --> 00:29:43.434
- Jody, of course.
- I mean just us.


353
00:29:45.977 --> 00:29:47.320
Um... yeah.

354
00:29:50.148 --> 00:29:51.616
Sure, yeah...

355
00:29:51.817 --> 00:29:53.319
- Go home, Jody.
- Okay.


356
00:29:53.527 --> 00:29:54.904
- Run!
- Okay.


357
00:29:58.281 --> 00:30:01.706
You cannot tell these parents that
somebody's murdering virgins.


358
00:30:02.536 --> 00:30:04.664
Maybe Annette DeWolde
would be alive today...


359
00:30:04.871 --> 00:30:07.215
if I had revealed details
about the first two killings.


360
00:30:07.416 --> 00:30:10.044
Jeez, Brent, get a hold of yourself.
You've got responsibilities.


361
00:30:10.252 --> 00:30:11.754
Get your hands off me!

362
00:30:12.546 --> 00:30:14.389
Don't talk to me about responsibilities!

363
00:30:14.589 --> 00:30:16.762
You and I both know what it
means to walk away from those.


364
00:30:17.384 --> 00:30:20.103
If word gets back to these kids
that somebody is...


365
00:30:21.012 --> 00:30:23.640
murdering virgins, we're
gonna have a goddamn...


366
00:30:25.434 --> 00:30:27.061
fuck fest on our hands.

367
00:30:27.269 --> 00:30:29.067
It's better than a pile of dead teenagers.

368
00:30:46.079 --> 00:30:48.089
- Oh, God...
- Boo!


369
00:30:48.290 --> 00:30:50.793
- What are you doing here?
- Timmy, what are you doing here?


370
00:30:51.001 --> 00:30:52.674
- I'm getting the scoop.
- Then, get it.


371
00:30:52.878 --> 00:30:55.427
I want to thank you very much
for coming out this evening.


372
00:30:56.631 --> 00:30:58.474
As I'm sure you all know...

373
00:30:59.384 --> 00:31:02.433
in the last two days
we have lost 3 of our children.


374
00:31:03.305 --> 00:31:05.933
We have now established a
common link between those killings.


375
00:31:06.224 --> 00:31:07.350
Well, what is it?

376
00:31:08.226 --> 00:31:10.604
All 3 victims attended
our public high school...


377
00:31:11.813 --> 00:31:15.693
and all 3 victims,
to the best of our knowledge...


378
00:31:15.901 --> 00:31:18.245
appeared to be... virgins.

379
00:31:20.447 --> 00:31:24.042
Holy hymens, Batman!
They're killing virgins?


380
00:31:24.242 --> 00:31:26.540
You're not suggesting that's
more than coincidence?


381
00:31:26.745 --> 00:31:29.501
- Are you close to an arrest?
- No.


382
00:31:29.706 --> 00:31:31.379
Well, what are we supposed
to tell our kids?


383
00:31:31.583 --> 00:31:33.711
To go out and get laid if they
want to feel safe?


384
00:31:34.252 --> 00:31:35.674
No, I'm not saying that.

385
00:31:35.879 --> 00:31:37.597
I can't lock my daughter
up in the basement.


386
00:31:38.048 --> 00:31:39.550
I wouldn't worry about it, Victor.

387
00:31:39.758 --> 00:31:41.931
What are you saying about my daughter?

388
00:31:42.135 --> 00:31:43.637
Sit down, Victor, I was joking.

389
00:31:43.845 --> 00:31:46.424
It 's a hell of a time to be joking
about a thing like this!


390
00:31:46.598 --> 00:31:47.895
Hey, back off!

391
00:31:52.479 --> 00:31:54.277
This is totally excellent!
Would you look at them?


392
00:31:54.481 --> 00:31:56.575
They've turned into a bunch of
mindless animals down there!


393
00:31:56.775 --> 00:31:59.198
Jody, get out of the way.

394
00:32:01.821 --> 00:32:04.119
Battery! Can I use your phone
for a second? Please?


395
00:32:04.324 --> 00:32:06.418
- Please? No, no, no, no.
- You never give it back to me.


396
00:32:07.160 --> 00:32:09.458
Please, remember why we came here!

397
00:32:10.372 --> 00:32:12.420
- Just give this to me.
- Here, here, here.


398
00:32:15.627 --> 00:32:17.800
Elway? Stop the presses...
Listen, I've got your story for you.


399
00:32:18.004 --> 00:32:20.132
Virgin killer terrorizes...
Wait, you're breaking up.


400
00:32:20.340 --> 00:32:22.388
No, no, no, not virtue killer...
virgin killer!


401
00:32:22.592 --> 00:32:23.969
I gotta get out
of this corridor, hang on.

402
00:32:24.386 --> 00:32:26.480
I'm asking you for the last time!

403
00:32:28.014 --> 00:32:29.812
Alright, that's enough!

404
00:32:31.476 --> 00:32:32.693
Oh, Daddy...

405
00:32:36.773 --> 00:32:37.865
Timmy?

406
00:32:40.485 --> 00:32:41.407
Timmy!

407
00:32:41.611 --> 00:32:43.158
I need my cell phone back!

408
00:32:46.908 --> 00:32:47.955
Timmy!

409
00:32:49.619 --> 00:32:50.620
Timmy?

410
00:32:54.958 --> 00:32:56.084
Shit!

411
00:33:01.756 --> 00:33:02.723
Timmy!

412
00:33:07.596 --> 00:33:08.722
Timmy!

413
00:33:14.102 --> 00:33:15.103
Timmy...

414
00:33:32.787 --> 00:33:33.788
Timmy?

415
00:33:44.633 --> 00:33:48.058
Timmy, come on! 
This isn't funny anymore!

416
00:33:49.971 --> 00:33:53.896
I'll be your best friend.
Your very, very, very best friend.


417
00:34:17.415 --> 00:34:20.881
Oh... is that for me?

418
00:35:41.458 --> 00:35:42.984
Virgin.

419
00:36:42.060 --> 00:36:43.277
Jody! Jody!

420
00:36:43.478 --> 00:36:44.900
- Daddy, she was after me!
- What?


421
00:36:45.104 --> 00:36:47.152
She killed Timmy! 
She's in there!

422
00:36:47.357 --> 00:36:49.780
- Take her! Stay back!
- Dad, be careful, please!


423
00:37:22.141 --> 00:37:24.860
Maybe the nose was just
a little bit smaller.


424
00:37:26.855 --> 00:37:29.574
And there was a gray streak right there.

425
00:37:32.026 --> 00:37:33.278
Like that, yeah.

426
00:37:38.783 --> 00:37:40.000
That's her.

427
00:37:41.661 --> 00:37:43.880
That's at least what I saw of her.

428
00:37:45.790 --> 00:37:47.133
Can you make her, Sheriff?

429
00:37:47.542 --> 00:37:48.759
I don't know.

430
00:37:51.045 --> 00:37:53.969
Hey, listen to me! Listen to me!

431
00:37:54.173 --> 00:37:56.141
- Listen to me!
- Give me the bell.


432
00:37:56.342 --> 00:38:00.436
You stupid fucking FBI sons of bitches,
why don't you come out here and get me?


433
00:38:00.647 --> 00:38:01.894
You did good, baby.

434
00:38:02.098 --> 00:38:04.351
Listen to me, I killed those kids.

435
00:38:04.559 --> 00:38:06.986
- I've got to make a couple of calls.
- Okay.


436
00:38:07.186 --> 00:38:08.813
Your mother will be here
in a couple of minutes, okay?


437
00:38:09.022 --> 00:38:10.524
- Okay.
- You'll be fine.


438
00:38:12.317 --> 00:38:13.193
Hey!

439
00:38:13.401 --> 00:38:15.904
- I killed those kids.
- Watch your language.


440
00:38:16.195 --> 00:38:19.244
You're a bunch of sons of bitches!
That's what you are.


441
00:38:19.449 --> 00:38:22.419
And you know what? I loved
killing those kids. They were evil.


442
00:38:22.619 --> 00:38:25.839
I loved killing them. But do you know
what I did before I killed them?


443
00:38:26.581 --> 00:38:29.088
I kissed them. Like this!

444
00:38:32.378 --> 00:38:34.472
Rolly, that's my name! 
Don't you hurt me!

445
00:38:34.881 --> 00:38:37.384
I'm telling you! I'm telling you!
I know my rights!


446
00:38:54.776 --> 00:38:55.698
Brent.

447
00:38:56.945 --> 00:38:58.663
Great meeting last night.

448
00:38:59.530 --> 00:39:01.407
Very comforting to the parents.

449
00:39:01.824 --> 00:39:04.452
- Listen, are you alone?
- Yes.


450
00:39:04.661 --> 00:39:06.538
Good, because I got something
I wanna show you.


451
00:39:06.746 --> 00:39:08.639
I'm faxing to you now.

452
00:39:31.938 --> 00:39:35.067
Are you looking at it?
Tell me that's not her.


453
00:39:36.109 --> 00:39:40.072
- Who?
- Loralee Sherman. Tell me that's not her?


454
00:39:41.572 --> 00:39:44.200
Oh, jeez Brent, you are cracking up.

455
00:39:44.409 --> 00:39:46.411
A few years ago,
I thought about contacting her.


456
00:39:46.619 --> 00:39:48.087
I traced her to West Virginia.

457
00:39:48.287 --> 00:39:50.881
About two hours from here.
This time I'm going out there.


458
00:39:51.082 --> 00:39:54.298
Listen, Brent... Nobody has seen
or heard of her for over 25 years.


459
00:39:54.502 --> 00:39:58.510
Now why the hell would she be showing up
now as some sort of psycho killer?


460
00:40:02.343 --> 00:40:04.391
Put the phone down, 
I'll call you back.

461
00:40:05.805 --> 00:40:07.978
- What are you doing?
- What's wrong?


462
00:40:08.683 --> 00:40:10.981
Were you listening to me?
What did you hear?


463
00:40:11.769 --> 00:40:14.773
No, I didn't hear anything. I just
picked up the phone to call Mom.


464
00:40:15.356 --> 00:40:18.610
I couldn't figure out how
to get a line out, that's all.


465
00:40:25.158 --> 00:40:28.833
Sorry, honey.
This case, I guess it's, uh...


466
00:40:29.704 --> 00:40:32.048
guess it's really getting to me.

467
00:40:32.248 --> 00:40:35.001
I'm sorry, baby,
it's not your fault, honey.


468
00:40:35.710 --> 00:40:36.802
It's not your fault.

469
00:40:44.260 --> 00:40:47.487
- Hi, Sheriff Marken.
- Hello, Sandy.


470
00:40:47.680 --> 00:40:50.650
Oh, my God, Jody. Are you okay?
Everybody's been asking about you.


471
00:40:50.850 --> 00:40:55.526
Sheriff! Rolly, prisoner wants
to make a full confession.


472
00:40:56.981 --> 00:40:59.029
I hope it's faster than
last week's confession.


473
00:41:01.778 --> 00:41:04.031
- God, you're not gonna believe this.
- What?


474
00:41:04.864 --> 00:41:06.832
Hurricane hormone has hit
the whole entire school.


475
00:41:07.658 --> 00:41:10.332
Word got out that your attacker
has this thing for virgins.


476
00:41:10.787 --> 00:41:14.836
So everyone's decided to take themselves
off endangered species list. And have sex.


477
00:41:15.041 --> 00:41:17.635
You're making it sound like
it's some kind of a flu shot.


478
00:41:17.835 --> 00:41:19.712
We're talking hymen holocaust here.

479
00:41:19.921 --> 00:41:22.970
But they couldn't print the location,
so I'm gonna give you the 411.


480
00:41:24.842 --> 00:41:27.561
- Where is it?
- The old Donkey Hill hunting lodge.


481
00:41:27.762 --> 00:41:30.936
That skashy keg place?
That place is such a shithole.


482
00:41:31.140 --> 00:41:32.887
All we need is floor space.

483
00:41:33.059 --> 00:41:36.025
Didn't you want your first time to be
something beautiful, something romantic?


484
00:41:36.270 --> 00:41:39.240
Jody, you have to go!
Everybody's gonna be there.


485
00:41:39.982 --> 00:41:42.110
Mark's going, of course. And Kenny.

486
00:41:43.778 --> 00:41:46.702
And you cannot leave saving his life
up to that slut Sharon.


487
00:41:47.740 --> 00:41:51.415
Cindy's holding her pre-game talk
at the bleacher's at lunch. All girls.


488
00:41:51.828 --> 00:41:53.000
Jody...

489
00:41:53.371 --> 00:41:55.749
- Sweetheart, how's my baby?
- I'm fine, Mom.


490
00:41:56.040 --> 00:41:58.509
How's your leg? Mm... baby.

491
00:41:58.876 --> 00:41:59.923
Hi, Mrs. Marken.

492
00:42:00.128 --> 00:42:03.332
Sandy, good to see you.
I'm so happy you're here.


493
00:42:04.215 --> 00:42:07.219
Honey, are you finished yet?
You ready to come home?


494
00:42:07.969 --> 00:42:11.731
- I was gonna go to school with Sandy.
- I don't think that's a very good idea.


495
00:42:11.931 --> 00:42:14.065
Why don't you go home with your mother?

496
00:42:14.225 --> 00:42:16.978
Dad, I'd really like to be
with my friends right now.


497
00:42:17.603 --> 00:42:19.826
She'll be safe with us, Mr. Marken.

498
00:42:20.314 --> 00:42:22.863
It's okay, Sheriff.
I'll keep an eye on her.


499
00:42:48.593 --> 00:42:50.720
- Jody!
- Come on!


500
00:42:56.934 --> 00:43:00.404
- It's nice to see you, Jody.
- Are you alright?


501
00:43:03.983 --> 00:43:06.156
How did you make it through?

502
00:43:09.822 --> 00:43:11.165
Hi.

503
00:43:15.161 --> 00:43:16.253
Jody...

504
00:43:17.455 --> 00:43:19.048
I almost lost you.

505
00:43:20.124 --> 00:43:22.377
I don't think I could
go on living if I had.


506
00:43:23.127 --> 00:43:25.880
- Really?
- Of course.


507
00:43:26.088 --> 00:43:28.011
What about what's her face?

508
00:43:29.717 --> 00:43:32.220
Ah, Jody, I love you.

509
00:43:33.179 --> 00:43:35.273
But I still have female friends.

510
00:43:35.806 --> 00:43:38.480
- But?
- But...


511
00:43:39.810 --> 00:43:43.860
Let's not fight. Come with me
to this party tonight.


512
00:43:44.232 --> 00:43:47.486
No, I promised my dad I'd be home
after school and I'd stay there.


513
00:43:47.693 --> 00:43:48.951
I promised.

514
00:43:49.111 --> 00:43:52.360
Look, if you don't
want to go with me...

515
00:43:53.157 --> 00:43:55.100
just say so.

516
00:43:55.284 --> 00:43:58.625
- Don't use your dad as an excuse.
- I'm not.


517
00:44:04.043 --> 00:44:05.340
Who's that?

518
00:44:06.671 --> 00:44:09.470
- It 's my bodyguard.
- Bodyguard?


519
00:44:10.091 --> 00:44:13.427
Yeah. I told my dad
I'd be home at 3.

520
00:44:13.970 --> 00:44:18.106
But you'll come with me? You'll come
with me later and we'll go together?


521
00:44:18.307 --> 00:44:19.809
I'll think about it.

522
00:44:37.201 --> 00:44:39.920
Girls have to do everything.

523
00:44:40.121 --> 00:44:41.998
Boys are totally clueless when
it comes to sex.


524
00:44:42.373 --> 00:44:44.421
It starts with them
trying to unhook our bras,


525
00:44:44.625 --> 00:44:46.798
fumbling around and it never changes.

526
00:44:47.461 --> 00:44:49.704
Wait until they try to put
their dicks in you.


527
00:44:50.339 --> 00:44:51.966
Please don't say they need help with that?

528
00:44:52.758 --> 00:44:54.386
Always.

529
00:44:56.012 --> 00:44:59.940
- What about birth control?
- Girls, there's no time for the pill...


530
00:45:00.141 --> 00:45:02.735
and certainly no chance
for withdraw, so...


531
00:45:03.352 --> 00:45:04.695
I recommend condoms.

532
00:45:05.521 --> 00:45:08.781
What about clitoral or vaginal orgasm?

533
00:45:08.941 --> 00:45:12.861
Unless we're talking about
masturbation, forget it.


534
00:45:16.365 --> 00:45:18.584
Aren't you being just
a little hard on the boys?


535
00:45:20.745 --> 00:45:24.750
Dennis asked me today
if chicks had 2 holes or 3.


536
00:45:25.082 --> 00:45:28.211
- Did not!
- How could you not know that, dude?


537
00:45:28.669 --> 00:45:32.299
Oh, yeah, I forgot I was hanging
with the poontang clan back here.


538
00:45:35.051 --> 00:45:37.474
I get it that
four kids are dead, but...

539
00:45:38.596 --> 00:45:41.270
I'm sorry, this is still pretty choice.

540
00:45:44.310 --> 00:45:46.157
No shit!

541
00:45:47.813 --> 00:45:50.612
Next thing we have to
do, is find a psycho

542
00:45:50.816 --> 00:45:54.069
who's offing chicks who don't give head.

543
00:45:55.154 --> 00:45:58.444
Yeah... Then I don't have
to worry about one hole.


544
00:46:00.284 --> 00:46:01.251
Nice and good afternoon.

545
00:46:01.452 --> 00:46:05.127
This is Stan Michaels, coming to you live
from George Washington High School...


546
00:46:05.581 --> 00:46:07.925
the epicenter of what can only
be described as...


547
00:46:08.125 --> 00:46:11.345
the senseless slaughter of innocence
here in Cherry Falls, Virginia.


548
00:46:11.670 --> 00:46:16.433
In the last 3 days, four teenagers have
been killed, a fifth viciously attacked.


549
00:46:16.634 --> 00:46:20.138
Certain local officials believe
the killer, still at large...


550
00:46:20.346 --> 00:46:23.441
may be targeting teenage
high school virgins.


551
00:46:23.849 --> 00:46:27.857
And now, students here on campus
are rumored have organized a sex party


552
00:46:28.062 --> 00:46:30.836
to actually eliminate themselves
as possible targets.


553
00:46:31.732 --> 00:46:34.076
Attention,
this is your principal speaking.


554
00:46:34.819 --> 00:46:36.913
It has come to my notice
that certain individuals


555
00:46:37.113 --> 00:46:40.083
have taken it upon themselves
to organize a wild party tonight.


556
00:46:41.117 --> 00:46:42.692
I want you to know...

557
00:46:42.852 --> 00:46:46.047
that any George Washington High
student attending this gap,


558
00:46:46.247 --> 00:46:50.743
will be disadvantaged by every
penalty it is in my power to impose.


559
00:47:04.140 --> 00:47:07.977
This report says local school officials at
a loss as to how to handle the situation.


560
00:47:08.185 --> 00:47:10.734
We'll get comments now from students...

561
00:47:44.346 --> 00:47:47.850
Hail, hail, Virgin High!
Drop your pants and fuck, or die!


562
00:47:48.058 --> 00:47:52.234
Hail, hail, Virgin High!
Drop your pants and fuck or die!


563
00:48:03.157 --> 00:48:04.409
Hi, Mom.

564
00:48:05.618 --> 00:48:07.962
How's my brave little baby?

565
00:48:08.162 --> 00:48:10.711
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.


566
00:48:10.915 --> 00:48:15.170
Don't worry, Deputy Mina was
watching me like a hawk all day.


567
00:48:15.920 --> 00:48:18.343
Must've been a very
interesting day at school.


568
00:48:18.672 --> 00:48:19.939
Yeah...

569
00:48:20.174 --> 00:48:22.927
Definitely wasn't your typical Thursday.

570
00:48:25.346 --> 00:48:27.644
I smell fresh cookies here.

571
00:48:29.141 --> 00:48:30.358
These are a little bit burnt,

572
00:48:30.559 --> 00:48:33.278
but I've got another batch coming out
of the oven in a second.


573
00:48:33.479 --> 00:48:34.321
Mmm.

574
00:48:34.522 --> 00:48:37.401
Oh, honey. Don't eat this.
Spit it out. Come on.


575
00:48:37.608 --> 00:48:40.031
Then let me get you some water
to wash it down.


576
00:48:42.029 --> 00:48:46.125
Mom? Do you know anything about
a woman named Loralee Sherman?


577
00:48:47.660 --> 00:48:49.168
Loralee Sherman?

578
00:48:49.328 --> 00:48:51.754
- Yeah.
- No, why?


579
00:48:51.914 --> 00:48:55.339
I overheard Daddy talking to
Mr. Sisler and they mentioned her.


580
00:48:56.460 --> 00:48:58.508
I have no idea who you're talking about.

581
00:48:59.630 --> 00:49:03.476
Mr. Sisler said that she had
disappeared 25 years ago.


582
00:49:05.135 --> 00:49:07.684
Wouldn't a story like that
make small town news?


583
00:49:10.224 --> 00:49:12.602
I've never heard of her,
and I've lived here all my life...


584
00:49:13.102 --> 00:49:15.150
except those two years at Berkeley.

585
00:49:18.357 --> 00:49:21.097
You know, I think you should go
lie down, take a little rest.


586
00:49:21.257 --> 00:49:24.367
You're looking a little pale. And I'll
call you when it's time for dinner, okay?


587
00:49:24.572 --> 00:49:25.664
I'm wasted.

588
00:49:27.241 --> 00:49:28.663
Okay, sweetheart?

589
00:49:45.301 --> 00:49:46.678
I'm going to West Virginia.

590
00:49:47.136 --> 00:49:49.559
West Virginia? 
We need you here.

591
00:49:49.972 --> 00:49:52.145
Well, there's something
I've gotta do there.


592
00:49:54.518 --> 00:49:58.022
Okay, I'll hold down the fort.

593
00:49:58.439 --> 00:50:01.534
But we are getting some calls
from some irate parents.


594
00:50:01.734 --> 00:50:04.786
What do you want us to do about this sex
party the high school kids are throwing?


595
00:50:04.987 --> 00:50:07.410
Sex party? Do you know where it is?

596
00:50:08.198 --> 00:50:09.324
I'll find out.

597
00:50:10.242 --> 00:50:12.336
Treat it like any other party.

598
00:50:13.120 --> 00:50:15.794
If there's trouble, move in.
Otherwise, lay off.


599
00:50:20.794 --> 00:50:22.296
I could be gone a while.

600
00:52:20.164 --> 00:52:21.211
Oh, God, Mom!

601
00:52:21.415 --> 00:52:24.043
What are you doing here?
You get your ass home right now!


602
00:52:24.251 --> 00:52:27.380
Mom, tell me about Loralee Sherman.
Tell me! Tell me!


603
00:52:27.713 --> 00:52:29.410
Tell me!

604
00:52:31.175 --> 00:52:33.122
When I was in high school...

605
00:52:34.470 --> 00:52:36.814
there was a girl named Loralee Sherman...

606
00:52:37.681 --> 00:52:40.025
that claimed she was raped by...

607
00:52:42.436 --> 00:52:44.279
4 drunken seniors.

608
00:52:44.938 --> 00:52:46.360
And?

609
00:52:49.193 --> 00:52:53.451
Nobody was ever formally charged. Nobody.

610
00:52:56.742 --> 00:52:59.211
Nobody was ever charged.

611
00:52:59.912 --> 00:53:01.585
Was there any evidence?

612
00:53:02.664 --> 00:53:06.005
- Did she identify them?
- Yeah.


613
00:53:06.210 --> 00:53:07.712
Then why weren't they charged?

614
00:53:08.337 --> 00:53:12.262
Because they were from good families,
stars of the football team.


615
00:53:12.466 --> 00:53:16.304
That kind of thing. And she was just
this loner that nobody cared for.


616
00:53:16.512 --> 00:53:19.061
She just thought she was
smarter than everybody.


617
00:53:20.349 --> 00:53:22.477
Nothing would have ever come from it.

618
00:53:23.393 --> 00:53:26.363
I don't know if it would have
held up in court.


619
00:53:27.147 --> 00:53:30.492
Not then, and I don't think it
would have held up now.


620
00:53:30.734 --> 00:53:32.657
So, you all just let it go?

621
00:53:32.861 --> 00:53:33.862
Yeah...

622
00:53:34.363 --> 00:53:36.281
She left town...

623
00:53:37.324 --> 00:53:39.998
and nobody ever saw her again.

624
00:53:42.412 --> 00:53:43.629
And that was...

625
00:53:45.040 --> 00:53:47.042
That was 27 years ago.

626
00:53:48.252 --> 00:53:49.845
Who were the men that raped her?

627
00:53:51.922 --> 00:53:53.344
Well...

628
00:53:53.549 --> 00:53:57.224
Two of the guys left town
about the year after that.


629
00:53:58.345 --> 00:54:01.974
And that was good thing, because we were
all able to move forward from there.


630
00:54:03.308 --> 00:54:04.605
Who else?

631
00:54:06.311 --> 00:54:09.815
- Tommy Sisler.
- The Principal.


632
00:54:12.401 --> 00:54:14.870
You said that there were four men.

633
00:54:15.863 --> 00:54:17.285
Who is the fourth?

634
00:54:20.742 --> 00:54:22.085
Mom?

635
00:54:27.624 --> 00:54:29.547
Who is the fourth, Mom?

636
00:54:32.337 --> 00:54:34.063
Mom?

637
00:54:37.426 --> 00:54:40.396
Your father. Your father.

638
00:54:43.015 --> 00:54:47.942
Honey, he didn't participate. He was
sick, he was falling down drunk.


639
00:54:48.604 --> 00:54:52.199
But he went to the police then, and
then he told them what happened?


640
00:54:53.191 --> 00:54:56.786
Honey, those were his good friends.
He couldn't do that.


641
00:54:56.987 --> 00:54:58.705
And besides,
what are you gonna tell the police?


642
00:54:58.906 --> 00:55:02.331
That a drunken girl had sex
with three drunken boys?


643
00:55:02.534 --> 00:55:04.135
- I mean who...
- No.


644
00:55:06.788 --> 00:55:08.415
You said it was rape.

645
00:58:26.238 --> 00:58:28.707
44, 10-5 to 45.

646
00:58:34.955 --> 00:58:36.447
45.

647
00:58:36.623 --> 00:58:38.349
What's your twenty?

648
00:58:41.586 --> 00:58:43.133
I'm headed back now.

649
00:58:43.463 --> 00:58:45.591
Did you find what
you were looking for, sir?


650
00:58:48.677 --> 00:58:50.053
Sir?

651
00:58:50.303 --> 00:58:51.720
I don't know.

652
00:58:51.888 --> 00:58:54.482
Well, I got a message for you
to meet up with Tom Sisler


653
00:58:54.683 --> 00:58:56.685
at the high school tonight, ASAP.

654
00:58:57.352 --> 00:58:58.799
Say what?

655
00:58:58.979 --> 00:59:03.200
Something to do with a Loralee Sherman.
I spoke to his secretary, sir.


656
00:59:05.277 --> 00:59:06.654
Sir, are you there?

657
00:59:07.737 --> 00:59:09.614
Roger that. I'll check it out.

658
00:59:39.144 --> 00:59:41.192
Honey, I really need to see you.

659
00:59:43.648 --> 00:59:44.945
You're early.

660
00:59:49.237 --> 00:59:51.706
My parents are total frauds.

661
00:59:53.783 --> 00:59:56.457
- It's disgusting.
- Of course they are.


662
00:59:56.912 --> 00:59:58.380
They're your parents.

663
01:00:00.415 --> 01:00:02.088
My dad's into hookers.

664
01:00:03.376 --> 01:00:06.129
I think my mom probably was a hooker.

665
01:00:14.638 --> 01:00:18.858
I can't believe I let them influence
every single decision that I've ever made.


666
01:00:19.392 --> 01:00:23.317
You lose your spiritual virginity...

667
01:00:24.397 --> 01:00:26.616
when you realize that your parents...

668
01:00:27.150 --> 01:00:29.903
are even bigger hypocrites
than your friends are.


669
01:00:31.821 --> 01:00:33.164
Yeah...

670
01:00:40.872 --> 01:00:42.124
Bite it.

671
01:00:50.590 --> 01:00:51.716
Bite it.

672
01:00:53.760 --> 01:00:54.807
Bite it.

673
01:00:56.304 --> 01:00:57.396
Harder.

674
01:00:59.015 --> 01:01:00.062
Yeah...

675
01:01:00.267 --> 01:01:01.519
Harder.

676
01:01:03.436 --> 01:01:04.528
Harder.

677
01:01:04.980 --> 01:01:06.152
Harder.

678
01:01:07.357 --> 01:01:08.449
Harder!

679
01:01:24.958 --> 01:01:26.551
Let's do it.

680
01:01:27.711 --> 01:01:31.341
Kenny, you've been pressuring me
for a whole year to sleep with you.


681
01:01:32.173 --> 01:01:33.925
Let's just do it.

682
01:01:35.552 --> 01:01:37.930
You're only doing it
'cause you're pissed at your parents.


683
01:01:38.138 --> 01:01:39.264
Aww...

684
01:01:40.765 --> 01:01:42.312
What's wrong, Kenny?

685
01:01:43.310 --> 01:01:44.687
Can't you decide?

686
01:01:45.854 --> 01:01:48.947
It doesn't have to be
this complicated, baby.


687
01:01:49.107 --> 01:01:50.703
Oh...

688
01:01:51.359 --> 01:01:53.236
Don't you like my body?

689
01:01:57.115 --> 01:01:58.367
I love your...

690
01:01:58.908 --> 01:02:00.876
I love your body, baby.

691
01:02:01.745 --> 01:02:06.091
I just want you to be with me
because you want to be with me.


692
01:02:06.833 --> 01:02:08.050
That's all.

693
01:02:08.960 --> 01:02:11.258
Spare me the violins.

694
01:02:14.716 --> 01:02:17.765
Hey, where are you going?

695
01:02:18.470 --> 01:02:20.268
I changed my mind about tonight.

696
01:02:20.847 --> 01:02:24.147
I don't need some stupid kids sex party.

697
01:02:26.811 --> 01:02:28.939
You have better company in mind?

698
01:02:29.147 --> 01:02:30.669
Well...

699
01:02:32.734 --> 01:02:34.031
Frankly, yes.

700
01:02:34.235 --> 01:02:36.704
Like Mr. Marliston, maybe?

701
01:02:37.906 --> 01:02:39.078
Whoa...

702
01:02:40.617 --> 01:02:42.039
Where did that come from?

703
01:02:44.287 --> 01:02:45.960
I've seen you hanging out with him.

704
01:02:48.875 --> 01:02:50.218
Well, you probably have.

705
01:02:50.418 --> 01:02:53.342
So now, I should start
looking for you around every corner...


706
01:02:53.546 --> 01:02:56.891
eavesdropping,
snooping and sneaking about?


707
01:03:00.637 --> 01:03:03.516
Kenny, I had no idea
that your poor mind...


708
01:03:04.849 --> 01:03:06.647
was so diseased.

709
01:03:19.656 --> 01:03:22.034
If you go now,
I don't want to see you again!


710
01:03:23.993 --> 01:03:25.245
It's over!

711
01:04:11.082 --> 01:04:14.086
You take the north side, you take the rear.
Beau, you get the south.


712
01:04:14.294 --> 01:04:15.341
I'll watch the front.

713
01:04:15.545 --> 01:04:18.389
Hey Deputy, do you want to
infiltrate the party with me?


714
01:04:18.590 --> 01:04:20.513
Go undercover for half an hour?

715
01:04:20.717 --> 01:04:22.219
Get movin'!

716
01:04:43.531 --> 01:04:44.657
Hey...

717
01:04:44.866 --> 01:04:46.459
Oh... Hi, Mark.

718
01:04:46.659 --> 01:04:50.004
Sharon, you look voluptuous.

719
01:04:51.247 --> 01:04:52.339
Eww...

720
01:04:52.832 --> 01:04:54.675
What is that smell?

721
01:04:55.418 --> 01:04:57.637
It's just a little cologne.

722
01:04:58.087 --> 01:05:01.637
I, uh, wouldn't go near any candles
if I were you.


723
01:05:01.841 --> 01:05:03.935
You might spontaneously combust.

724
01:05:09.474 --> 01:05:11.226
- Hi, Mark.
- Oh, hi.


725
01:05:15.772 --> 01:05:17.599
What's that smell?

726
01:05:18.107 --> 01:05:19.583
Uh...

727
01:05:20.026 --> 01:05:21.373
Nothin'.

728
01:05:23.446 --> 01:05:24.743
I like it.

729
01:05:26.574 --> 01:05:28.075
Yeah?

730
01:05:56.187 --> 01:05:57.655
You like to dance?

731
01:06:04.404 --> 01:06:05.871
Hi.

732
01:06:09.158 --> 01:06:11.627
Have you ever played Death Quake?

733
01:06:14.122 --> 01:06:17.467
Okay, but you have to wear a rubber.

734
01:06:19.627 --> 01:06:21.800
- And I want your CDs.
- Not my imports.


735
01:06:22.005 --> 01:06:24.884
I want everything.
Domestic, imports, bootlegs, works.


736
01:06:30.305 --> 01:06:32.399
Okay, you can have my CDs.

737
01:06:32.599 --> 01:06:35.227
- And your K2 snowboard.
- Not my snowboard.


738
01:06:37.312 --> 01:06:39.565
Alright, the board too.

739
01:06:40.273 --> 01:06:43.493
You know, that's an awful lot
for 10 minutes of beasting.


740
01:06:44.152 --> 01:06:47.407
Don't flatter yourself, you'll be
lucky to last 10 seconds.


741
01:06:47.572 --> 01:06:51.327
You just better hope that when I erupt
you don't end up on the ceiling.


742
01:06:56.414 --> 01:06:59.084
- Hi.
- Hey, Sharon...


743
01:07:02.253 --> 01:07:04.676
You don't have to be nervous.

744
01:07:05.798 --> 01:07:07.550
You're the one who's shaking.

745
01:07:25.693 --> 01:07:27.460
You okay?

746
01:07:27.620 --> 01:07:28.796
Yeah...

747
01:07:29.113 --> 01:07:31.115
Yeah. Oh...

748
01:07:33.076 --> 01:07:34.123
What 's wrong?

749
01:07:35.078 --> 01:07:37.126
I can't face this is happening again.

750
01:07:37.705 --> 01:07:40.549
Twice today I stopped a girl from
putting her hands in my pants.


751
01:07:41.709 --> 01:07:45.304
Is there something you want to
tell me? I don't mind a challenge.


752
01:07:48.883 --> 01:07:51.727
Right. Neither do I.

753
01:07:52.345 --> 01:07:55.431
Thank you, Sharon. Thank you.

754
01:07:56.307 --> 01:07:58.480
You could've given it a shot.

755
01:07:59.769 --> 01:08:02.522
Hey, uh, I always knew
he was a butt pirate.


756
01:08:03.356 --> 01:08:07.031
- You wanna get with a real man?
- No. Do you?


757
01:08:07.235 --> 01:08:08.282
Ow!

758
01:08:21.082 --> 01:08:22.584
Hi, Mr. Marliston.

759
01:08:22.792 --> 01:08:24.886
Oh, jeez Jody, you scared me. Hi.

760
01:08:25.086 --> 01:08:26.178
I'm sorry.

761
01:08:27.505 --> 01:08:30.759
- How are you?
- Good. How are you doing?


762
01:08:32.552 --> 01:08:34.304
What have you got in this trunk?

763
01:08:34.512 --> 01:08:38.312
Oh, just, you know,
just some old memorabilia.


764
01:08:39.016 --> 01:08:40.939
Do you want a hand or something?

765
01:08:41.936 --> 01:08:44.906
Yeah... yeah, I could use
a hand with this.


766
01:08:45.481 --> 01:08:48.110
Are you sure you're up for it?
It's going all the way into my basement.


767
01:08:52.029 --> 01:08:53.531
There, go this way.

768
01:08:55.366 --> 01:08:56.624
You know...

769
01:08:56.784 --> 01:08:59.663
You're just about the only person
that I trust these days.


770
01:09:00.037 --> 01:09:04.550
Me? Come on. What about your dad?
I know how close you are with your father.


771
01:09:05.293 --> 01:09:08.843
I found out some pretty terrible
things about my father recently.


772
01:09:09.046 --> 01:09:10.548
- Oh, yeah...
- Yeah.


773
01:09:11.048 --> 01:09:15.536
Like what? That he's a liar,
a fraud... a criminal?


774
01:09:16.095 --> 01:09:17.712
Yeah.

775
01:09:28.524 --> 01:09:30.026
What's in the trunk?

776
01:09:31.152 --> 01:09:32.862
Your dad.

777
01:09:33.571 --> 01:09:34.743
Maybe mine.

778
01:09:48.753 --> 01:09:50.346
Daddy!

779
01:10:56.237 --> 01:10:58.239
Hey, Brent, tell us the story...

780
01:10:58.447 --> 01:11:01.050
Tell us about what happened

781
01:11:01.258 --> 01:11:05.254
when you were very drunk.

782
01:11:07.206 --> 01:11:11.507
Tom Sisler's in the story, and so is a woman
by the name of Loralee Sherman.


783
01:11:12.503 --> 01:11:14.505
There are people who can help you.

784
01:11:18.301 --> 01:11:21.225
Don't hurt her! Please!

785
01:11:22.555 --> 01:11:25.061
I'm not gonna hurt her.

786
01:11:25.266 --> 01:11:27.564
You are, with the truth.

787
01:11:31.522 --> 01:11:32.990
I'll get you started.

788
01:11:34.525 --> 01:11:36.823
See, I remember the story like this.
It was...


789
01:11:37.153 --> 01:11:39.952
a dark and scary night...

790
01:11:41.616 --> 01:11:42.993
kind of like tonight.

791
01:11:43.242 --> 01:11:46.788
My mother already told me this story!
You can't hurt me with this story!


792
01:11:46.996 --> 01:11:51.287
Shut up! Shut up!
I'll kill you if you don't shut up!


793
01:11:51.751 --> 01:11:54.220
Alright! I'll tell you!

794
01:12:08.851 --> 01:12:10.973
There were four of us.

795
01:12:11.771 --> 01:12:13.343
We were drunk.

796
01:12:15.942 --> 01:12:18.320
About ready to graduate from high school.

797
01:12:21.906 --> 01:12:25.410
We were going to a party to
celebrate the end of our senior year.


798
01:12:29.622 --> 01:12:32.421
Then we saw a car broke down
on the side of the road.


799
01:12:34.752 --> 01:12:36.254
It was Loralee.

800
01:12:44.303 --> 01:12:46.271
We all knew her from school.

801
01:12:46.847 --> 01:12:49.521
She was a weird kid.

802
01:12:51.644 --> 01:12:53.567
Kind of pretty in a way, I guess.

803
01:12:55.189 --> 01:12:57.112
I was in really bad shape.

804
01:13:01.070 --> 01:13:03.198
Tom told her to
get into his car, but...

805
01:13:05.616 --> 01:13:07.118
she wouldn't do it.

806
01:13:09.120 --> 01:13:11.168
So, they started teasing her.

807
01:13:13.958 --> 01:13:15.505
Laughing at her.

808
01:13:16.627 --> 01:13:18.004
And then she got mad.

809
01:13:19.964 --> 01:13:21.932
She called Tom a homo...

810
01:13:22.466 --> 01:13:24.768
...and then she just took off.

811
01:13:26.053 --> 01:13:28.101
And they took off right after her.

812
01:13:32.476 --> 01:13:34.478
That's when things got crazy.

813
01:13:36.897 --> 01:13:38.991
They poured booze down her throat.

814
01:13:40.735 --> 01:13:42.533
Then, I guess what happened...

815
01:13:52.163 --> 01:13:53.665
Well, you know what happened.

816
01:13:54.457 --> 01:13:56.585
Yeah, well, I don't remember,
so, keep going.


817
01:13:57.752 --> 01:14:00.426
First Tom, then Harry...

818
01:14:02.423 --> 01:14:03.595
...then Jim.

819
01:14:05.134 --> 01:14:07.307
Then, they came looking for me...

820
01:14:07.928 --> 01:14:09.430
and they grabbed me...

821
01:14:12.266 --> 01:14:13.813
...they threw me on top of her.

822
01:14:15.519 --> 01:14:17.112
But I knew what I was doing.

823
01:14:17.313 --> 01:14:20.157
God help me, I
knew what I was doing!

824
01:14:21.776 --> 01:14:23.644
God, daddy, no.

825
01:14:25.946 --> 01:14:28.745
Happy graduation, baby! Woo!

826
01:14:33.120 --> 01:14:34.292
I knew.

827
01:14:59.146 --> 01:15:01.274
Did you know that she
was in love with you, Brent?


828
01:15:02.066 --> 01:15:05.741
Oh, yeah. Love letters, poems, songs...

829
01:15:06.237 --> 01:15:08.581
All things she wrote before you raped her.

830
01:15:10.741 --> 01:15:14.917
That's why she came over to the car.
Because she saw your face.


831
01:15:15.955 --> 01:15:19.504
She never had the nerve to approach
the big star quarterback, Brent Marken.


832
01:15:22.086 --> 01:15:24.680
You never knew that
she loved you, did you, Brent?


833
01:15:25.005 --> 01:15:27.053
Oh, how could you?

834
01:15:28.050 --> 01:15:30.849
She never had the nerve to approach
you before you raped her.


835
01:15:31.053 --> 01:15:33.772
And after you raped her,
there was no one to tell.


836
01:15:35.975 --> 01:15:37.272
Except me.

837
01:15:41.063 --> 01:15:43.907
Over and over again.

838
01:15:49.947 --> 01:15:52.791
It's very difficult to look like
the one person in the world


839
01:15:52.992 --> 01:15:55.290
your mother loves and hates the most.

840
01:15:58.622 --> 01:16:00.420
We have the same color of eyes...

841
01:16:01.292 --> 01:16:02.418
No...

842
01:16:03.335 --> 01:16:04.382
Dad.

843
01:16:05.045 --> 01:16:06.467
No, no...

844
01:16:09.175 --> 01:16:11.847
No... No.

845
01:16:12.094 --> 01:16:14.688
It's a stinking hypocritical world,
isn't it, Brent?


846
01:16:15.306 --> 01:16:17.684
Where rapists become
the pillars of the community.


847
01:16:18.392 --> 01:16:21.236
And the stinking
hypocritical people in it...


848
01:16:21.729 --> 01:16:25.074
wouldn't even miss their own
worthless befouled lives very much.


849
01:16:25.858 --> 01:16:27.359
So...

850
01:16:28.152 --> 01:16:32.328
So, what better to deprive them
of the only innocence they have left.


851
01:16:34.200 --> 01:16:35.817
Their precious...

852
01:16:37.119 --> 01:16:39.292
virginal children.

853
01:16:50.257 --> 01:16:52.476
Please! Don't hurt her!

854
01:16:55.804 --> 01:16:56.805
No!

855
01:17:04.230 --> 01:17:05.672
No!

856
01:17:08.984 --> 01:17:10.060
Does that hurt?

857
01:17:12.404 --> 01:17:13.576
Please, help!

858
01:17:15.324 --> 01:17:17.076
Help!

859
01:17:17.534 --> 01:17:18.330
Shut up!

860
01:17:20.829 --> 01:17:23.678
- Goddamn that bell!
- Help!


861
01:17:25.876 --> 01:17:27.643
I'm coming!

862
01:17:29.713 --> 01:17:33.617
Hi, Kenny.
What are you doing here at midnight?


863
01:17:35.010 --> 01:17:36.387
Mister Marliston...

864
01:17:36.595 --> 01:17:38.438
Mister... M...

865
01:17:38.639 --> 01:17:40.516
Something wrong with your mouth, Kenny?
What do you want?


866
01:17:54.738 --> 01:17:56.957
- Where's Jody?
- How should I know?


867
01:17:57.449 --> 01:17:59.543
'Cause her bike is parked by your stairs.

868
01:17:59.743 --> 01:18:01.244
No, it's not.

869
01:18:08.877 --> 01:18:11.255
Why are you looking at me
like that, Kenny?


870
01:18:11.547 --> 01:18:14.300
- Why are you wearing lipstick?
- Because it makes me pretty.


871
01:18:25.936 --> 01:18:27.062
Jody!

872
01:18:36.030 --> 01:18:37.452
Jody!

873
01:18:39.992 --> 01:18:41.039
Jody!

874
01:19:10.773 --> 01:19:14.198
You hurt my daughter! 
I'm gonna kill you!

875
01:19:15.986 --> 01:19:18.956
Jody! Jody! Jody!

876
01:19:22.993 --> 01:19:24.461
Get out of here!

877
01:19:25.704 --> 01:19:27.172
Fuckin' move!

878
01:19:32.169 --> 01:19:33.466
Jody, come on!

879
01:19:41.178 --> 01:19:43.897
The music! To the lounge, come on!

880
01:20:02.324 --> 01:20:04.873
Hold it! You stop right there!

881
01:20:05.411 --> 01:20:07.505
Mr. Marliston just killed my daddy!

882
01:20:07.704 --> 01:20:09.706
He killed all those kids.
He's trying to kill us!


883
01:20:09.915 --> 01:20:11.087
- Jody?
- Yeah.


884
01:20:11.291 --> 01:20:12.543
Well, who's that with you?

885
01:20:12.751 --> 01:20:15.595
I'm Kenny Ascott!
And everything she says is true!


886
01:20:17.047 --> 01:20:20.217
This is White Knight on the south side
to Black Queen, do you copy, over?


887
01:20:20.426 --> 01:20:23.895
- Black Queen to White Knight, over.
- Brent's dead! Marliston's the killer!


888
01:20:24.096 --> 01:20:26.982
He nailed the chief! 
Do you copy, over?

889
01:20:27.182 --> 01:20:30.982
- You better come, come on.
- This is my post, I can't just split!


890
01:20:36.207 --> 01:20:37.709
Shit!

891
01:20:38.084 --> 01:20:39.927
Goddamn it!

892
01:20:48.203 --> 01:20:50.001
Nobody's here. Let's move!

893
01:20:53.041 --> 01:20:55.715
- Help!
- Help!


894
01:21:01.925 --> 01:21:05.140
- It's Mr. Marliston! He's the killer!
- Let's run!


895
01:21:06.430 --> 01:21:08.023
Class dismissed!

896
01:21:21.945 --> 01:21:23.288
Run, Jody! Run!

897
01:21:23.489 --> 01:21:24.832
Kenny!

898
01:21:32.498 --> 01:21:33.715
Kenny!

899
01:21:43.717 --> 01:21:45.084
Come on!

900
01:21:50.057 --> 01:21:52.230
Get out of the way! 
Get out of the way!

901
01:21:55.854 --> 01:21:57.671
Go away!

902
01:22:02.027 --> 01:22:03.279
Jody!

903
01:22:31.682 --> 01:22:32.808
Stay there.

904
01:22:52.202 --> 01:22:53.579
Kenny!

905
01:22:55.455 --> 01:22:56.877
Kenny!

906
01:23:48.050 --> 01:23:50.269
- Mark, don't!
- Man, get back here!


907
01:23:51.428 --> 01:23:52.975
Mister Marliston.

908
01:23:58.644 --> 01:24:00.570
- No!
- Get outta here!


909
01:24:41.561 --> 01:24:45.737
So you have absolutely no idea
why your father was in West Virginia?


910
01:24:51.363 --> 01:24:53.288
And you can think of no reason...

911
01:24:53.448 --> 01:24:55.917
why Leonard Marliston
committed these murders?


912
01:24:57.202 --> 01:24:58.698
No.

913
01:24:59.121 --> 01:25:02.821
And after all this, you can think
of nothing else to tell me?


914
01:25:03.208 --> 01:25:07.303
I think you've asked my daughter
enough questions. Agent Bronhill.


915
01:25:09.548 --> 01:25:12.092
Well, thank you for now, ladies.

916
01:25:12.509 --> 01:25:14.182
You've been very cooperative.

917
01:25:22.894 --> 01:25:24.111
Let's go.
