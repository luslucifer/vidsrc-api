00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:53.404
In this life,

2
00:00:53.405 --> 00:00:55.885
Savannah had only
encountered two phenomena


3
00:00:55.886 --> 00:00:58.497
with unequivocal
rarity and beauty.


4
00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:04.415
The first was the magical
glow of the blue moon,


5
00:01:04.416 --> 00:01:07.331
so named for its scarcity.

6
00:01:07.332 --> 00:01:11.902
It appeared only once or
twice every two or three years.


7
00:01:13.991 --> 00:01:16.080
And the other was love,
an even rarer occurrence,


8
00:01:17.821 --> 00:01:20.998
ignited by the passion
of a man named linden.


9
00:01:26.743 --> 00:01:29.527
However, even
the truest devotion


10
00:01:29.528 --> 00:01:32.313
can be threatened by ambition,

11
00:01:32.314 --> 00:01:35.838
and for Savannah, this
coursed through her veins


12
00:01:35.839 --> 00:01:38.320
like a fire that refuse to dim.

13
00:01:43.673 --> 00:01:44.934
I love you.

14
00:01:44.935 --> 00:01:46.936
On the strike of midnight,

15
00:01:46.937 --> 00:01:48.377
it would be time
for her to choose...


16
00:01:50.462 --> 00:01:53.421
Between her heart's
comfort or destiny unknown.


17
00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:56.991
She could have
one but never both.


18
00:01:58.601 --> 00:02:00.384
As she disappeared
into the night


19
00:02:00.385 --> 00:02:03.823
to the sound of pounding
hooves on cobblestone,


20
00:02:03.824 --> 00:02:07.261
Savannah pulls off
her heels and she turns


21
00:02:07.262 --> 00:02:10.091
for one last glimpse
of her true love.


22
00:02:13.529 --> 00:02:15.660
Now that's how you finish a
book! Wouldn't you say, grace?


23
00:02:15.661 --> 00:02:18.446
I know! I did it
once, I can do it again.


24
00:02:18.447 --> 00:02:20.013
Uh-uh! Hello!

25
00:02:20.014 --> 00:02:21.841
Where's the fire? Come
on, I'm not feeling it!


26
00:02:21.842 --> 00:02:24.060
Maybe I have nothing
left to say about love.


27
00:02:24.061 --> 00:02:26.497
It's not like romance is
the only genre out there.


28
00:02:26.498 --> 00:02:27.759
Mysteries are always popular.

29
00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:29.892
Your deadline is in 10 days,

30
00:02:29.893 --> 00:02:32.068
and we're paying you for
the third book in this trilogy,


31
00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:35.158
so you better find something
worth saying about romance.


32
00:02:35.159 --> 00:02:36.856
I'm gonna be frank.

33
00:02:36.857 --> 00:02:38.814
Your book sales have
dropped significantly


34
00:02:38.815 --> 00:02:40.598
in the last quarter.

35
00:02:40.599 --> 00:02:42.600
If this book doesn't
hit the bestseller list,


36
00:02:42.601 --> 00:02:44.341
we won't be extending
your contract.


37
00:02:44.342 --> 00:02:46.300
I'll get the pages
out to you, okay?


38
00:02:46.301 --> 00:02:48.998
I'll force them out
one way or another.


39
00:02:48.999 --> 00:02:51.522
No, you're not
gonna force anything.


40
00:02:51.523 --> 00:02:54.874
You're gonna weave a
tapestry of love and passion


41
00:02:54.875 --> 00:02:58.094
that ends this trilogy
was such fierce emotion


42
00:02:58.095 --> 00:03:00.618
people are gonna be buying
your book for the next 10 years.


43
00:03:00.619 --> 00:03:01.706
Fierce emotions. Gotcha.

44
00:03:01.707 --> 00:03:03.491
Yes!

45
00:03:03.492 --> 00:03:04.709
You know, get a
change of scenery.


46
00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:06.886
Ask someone on a date.

47
00:03:06.887 --> 00:03:08.583
Wanna go on a date?

48
00:03:08.584 --> 00:03:10.890
Not me, but I
like the confidence.


49
00:03:10.891 --> 00:03:12.501
Ooh! How 'bout him?

50
00:03:14.503 --> 00:03:16.063
How'd you even
know that was in there?


51
00:03:20.465 --> 00:03:21.813
Do you think I would have
forgotten about your muse


52
00:03:21.814 --> 00:03:24.207
when you, a lowly,
unpublished writer


53
00:03:24.208 --> 00:03:26.601
approached me with the
most heartfelt manuscript


54
00:03:26.602 --> 00:03:28.646
I'd ever set my eyes on?

55
00:03:28.647 --> 00:03:30.692
Sean's irrelevant. He
broke up with me, remember?


56
00:03:30.693 --> 00:03:32.824
No, you broke up with him
because he was being distant.


57
00:03:32.825 --> 00:03:34.914
Same thing!

58
00:03:34.915 --> 00:03:37.351
He's probably often in
Europe researching catacombs


59
00:03:37.352 --> 00:03:40.310
or imagining the
next Eiffel Tower.


60
00:03:40.311 --> 00:03:41.311
What's this?

61
00:03:41.312 --> 00:03:42.312
What?

62
00:03:43.488 --> 00:03:45.185
The blue moon ball.

63
00:03:45.186 --> 00:03:47.143
Um...

64
00:03:47.144 --> 00:03:50.016
It's just a hometown event
that happens every few years.


65
00:03:50.017 --> 00:03:51.626
Flyer I used to think
was meaningful.


66
00:03:52.454 --> 00:03:53.411
Used to?

67
00:03:53.412 --> 00:03:54.455
Sounds quaint.

68
00:03:54.456 --> 00:03:56.544
Ancient history now.

69
00:03:56.545 --> 00:03:59.329
Grace, stop waiting for
the moment's stars to align.


70
00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:01.418
Take action in your life!

71
00:04:01.419 --> 00:04:03.594
Fight for your love!

72
00:04:03.595 --> 00:04:05.727
I need you to think about
where your heart was


73
00:04:05.728 --> 00:04:07.685
when you first met Sean,

74
00:04:07.686 --> 00:04:09.905
when you first fell
in love with him.


75
00:04:09.906 --> 00:04:11.386
Go there and write.

76
00:04:13.431 --> 00:04:14.431
Okay?

77
00:04:17.653 --> 00:04:19.089
My book signing!

78
00:04:46.812 --> 00:04:47.812
- Hey.
- Hi!


79
00:04:49.598 --> 00:04:51.599
So nice to meet a
fellow rom reader.


80
00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:55.298
Actually, I'm just looking
for some books on isometrics.


81
00:04:55.299 --> 00:04:56.299
Oh.

82
00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:13.926
Oh!

83
00:05:13.927 --> 00:05:15.710
I am so sorry!

84
00:05:15.711 --> 00:05:16.798
Are you all right?

85
00:05:16.799 --> 00:05:18.930
I'm fine.

86
00:05:18.931 --> 00:05:22.761
I am such a klutz. Hopefully
my patients never find out.


87
00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:25.720
Um...

88
00:05:26.722 --> 00:05:29.506
I'm really sorry, again.

89
00:05:29.507 --> 00:05:30.900
Have a good evening.

90
00:05:33.598 --> 00:05:35.904
Um, I mean, I
am a little bruised.


91
00:05:37.602 --> 00:05:39.690
Nothing a book
sale wouldn't fix.


92
00:05:39.691 --> 00:05:42.693
Well, I can't say I've
ever read a romance novel.


93
00:05:42.694 --> 00:05:44.652
Is this one any good?

94
00:05:44.653 --> 00:05:47.916
Only if you like
your passion red hot.


95
00:05:47.917 --> 00:05:51.876
Sounds like I could get
burned if I'm not careful.


96
00:05:51.877 --> 00:05:53.530
So you're a doctor?

97
00:05:53.531 --> 00:05:55.576
Resident currently,

98
00:05:55.577 --> 00:05:56.838
so I'm good with burns.

99
00:05:58.884 --> 00:06:01.277
Well, what do you
residents like to do for fun?


100
00:06:01.278 --> 00:06:03.932
Fun hasn't come
up much lately.


101
00:06:03.933 --> 00:06:05.803
We do enjoy an
occasional brunch.


102
00:06:05.804 --> 00:06:06.804
Me too!

103
00:06:08.198 --> 00:06:10.765
Maybe the author
of "river romance"


104
00:06:10.766 --> 00:06:12.549
would be open to
discussing her novel


105
00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:14.029
over mimosas some time?

106
00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:15.336
She might be.

107
00:06:16.989 --> 00:06:18.207
James.

108
00:06:18.208 --> 00:06:19.817
- James?
- Strong name.


109
00:06:19.818 --> 00:06:20.818
Thank you.

110
00:06:20.819 --> 00:06:21.820
I'll just...

111
00:06:23.170 --> 00:06:24.649
Give you my number.

112
00:06:31.352 --> 00:06:32.352
Ciao.

113
00:06:33.789 --> 00:06:36.007
That was a hot tamale!

114
00:06:36.008 --> 00:06:37.401
Nicely done, dear!

115
00:06:40.665 --> 00:06:41.665
Okay.

116
00:06:43.233 --> 00:06:45.147
It's quite nippy
out there tonight.


117
00:06:45.148 --> 00:06:48.411
Keeping people inside, I think.

118
00:06:48.412 --> 00:06:49.673
Leaving already?

119
00:06:49.674 --> 00:06:50.674
Yes.

120
00:06:52.851 --> 00:06:54.678
Thank you you so much for
letting me use your store, ester.


121
00:06:54.679 --> 00:06:56.811
Nevermind about the turnout.

122
00:06:56.812 --> 00:06:58.987
You're a great writer!

123
00:06:58.988 --> 00:07:01.163
Thank you.

124
00:07:01.164 --> 00:07:03.078
I want you to come back
here for your next book launch.


125
00:07:03.079 --> 00:07:04.384
If I have one.

126
00:07:04.385 --> 00:07:05.820
You will!

127
00:07:05.821 --> 00:07:07.909
Just don't give up.

128
00:07:07.910 --> 00:07:11.173
That's the secret to
anything worthwhile,


129
00:07:11.174 --> 00:07:14.829
because, you know,
everyone loves a happy ending.


130
00:07:14.830 --> 00:07:16.135
Me too.

131
00:07:44.816 --> 00:07:45.816
What?

132
00:07:51.432 --> 00:07:52.432
Oh!

133
00:07:55.740 --> 00:07:57.872
Pinch me! I'm dreaming!

134
00:08:00.092 --> 00:08:01.919
Hi, mom.

135
00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:04.792
I can't believe
you're really here!


136
00:08:04.793 --> 00:08:06.620
And just in time!

137
00:08:06.621 --> 00:08:08.796
How serendipitous.

138
00:08:08.797 --> 00:08:10.189
It was kind of a
last-minute decision.


139
00:08:10.190 --> 00:08:12.321
Well, I'll take it.

140
00:08:12.322 --> 00:08:15.020
Come on, let's get
you in the house.


141
00:08:20.678 --> 00:08:22.810
I miss this place.

142
00:08:22.811 --> 00:08:24.681
I wish I could
transplant it back to la.


143
00:08:26.728 --> 00:08:30.165
Well, la may have
skyscrapers and strip malls,


144
00:08:30.166 --> 00:08:31.819
but it doesn't have
the blue moon ball.


145
00:08:33.778 --> 00:08:35.257
Please, that's so far away,

146
00:08:35.258 --> 00:08:37.564
it's the last thing on my mind.

147
00:08:37.565 --> 00:08:39.435
What do you mean?

148
00:08:39.436 --> 00:08:42.525
I assumed you knew the
blue moon is this Friday.


149
00:08:43.527 --> 00:08:45.136
It can't be!

150
00:08:45.137 --> 00:08:46.137
It's supposed to be
another five years


151
00:08:46.138 --> 00:08:47.878
until the next blue moon.

152
00:08:47.879 --> 00:08:50.404
That's how long
you've been away.


153
00:08:51.274 --> 00:08:52.274
Really?

154
00:08:53.798 --> 00:08:55.973
It feels like no time at all.

155
00:08:55.974 --> 00:08:58.672
Well, the good
news is you're back,


156
00:08:58.673 --> 00:09:01.196
and this is gonna be
a very special year,


157
00:09:01.197 --> 00:09:03.067
where the blue moon
falls on the same night


158
00:09:03.068 --> 00:09:04.721
as the harvest moon.

159
00:09:04.722 --> 00:09:06.071
I thought you knew.

160
00:09:10.032 --> 00:09:13.252
I'm sorry I've been
away for so long.


161
00:09:13.253 --> 00:09:15.515
But I'm really happy
I'm not missing this.


162
00:09:15.516 --> 00:09:18.431
You work too hard
in that career of yours.


163
00:09:18.432 --> 00:09:22.913
You have always been
single-minded, and I am so glad


164
00:09:22.914 --> 00:09:26.221
that you finally took
some time for yourself.


165
00:09:26.222 --> 00:09:28.005
But if you didn't
know about the ball,


166
00:09:28.006 --> 00:09:31.008
what brought you back home?

167
00:09:31.009 --> 00:09:35.230
My agent suggested it.

168
00:09:35.231 --> 00:09:36.710
He wanted me to
return to the place


169
00:09:36.711 --> 00:09:38.625
where I first
learned about love.


170
00:09:38.626 --> 00:09:40.844
Back to your mom,

171
00:09:40.845 --> 00:09:42.925
who's the person who loves
you the most in the world.


172
00:09:44.066 --> 00:09:45.066
Exactly.

173
00:09:47.765 --> 00:09:50.376
Well, I should get to bed.

174
00:09:50.377 --> 00:09:51.986
I've got a full day
of work tomorrow.


175
00:09:51.987 --> 00:09:53.770
Okay.

176
00:09:53.771 --> 00:09:56.599
I'm gonna make this
trip extra inspirational.


177
00:09:56.600 --> 00:09:58.035
Thanks, mom.

178
00:09:58.036 --> 00:09:59.254
I'm gonna start with baking.

179
00:09:59.255 --> 00:10:00.603
- Yes!
- Okay.


180
00:10:01.866 --> 00:10:02.866
Goodnight.

the intense writer phase.

Hilarious!

194

I'm going the old

195
00:11:17.638 --> 00:11:19.595
and I didn't want
anyone to recognize me.


196
00:11:19.596 --> 00:11:21.815
People are gonna think
you're there to mug them.

Maybe they'll
keep their distance.


198
00:11:27.125 --> 00:11:29.649

isn't the best...

Are my eyes deceiving

217
00:12:43.027 --> 00:12:43.811
Heather.

218
00:12:43.811 --> 00:12:44.725
Hey.

219
00:12:44.725 --> 00:12:45.725
Grace!

220
00:12:47.075 --> 00:12:48.467
Grace, grace,
grace, grace, grace


221
00:12:48.468 --> 00:12:50.425
girl, did I ever miss you!

222
00:12:50.426 --> 00:12:52.775
I missed you too.

223
00:12:52.776 --> 00:12:54.211
So much missing.

224
00:12:55.518 --> 00:12:57.301
See my truck on your way in?

225
00:12:57.302 --> 00:12:58.260
I just got new mud tires on her.

226
00:12:58.260 --> 00:12:59.217
Can you believe it?

227
00:12:59.218 --> 00:13:01.088
Wow.

228
00:13:01.089 --> 00:13:02.481
That must've cost
you an arm and a leg.


229
00:13:02.482 --> 00:13:05.527
Boyfriend's leg, not mine.

230
00:13:05.528 --> 00:13:09.052
I'm so glad to see that you
made it back, just in time, too.


231
00:13:09.053 --> 00:13:10.445
I know. For the ball, right?

232
00:13:10.446 --> 00:13:12.229
Oh, sure. If that
even happens,


233
00:13:12.230 --> 00:13:13.970
they'll probably
have the permits


234
00:13:13.971 --> 00:13:15.450
to tear this old heap
of timber down by then.


235
00:13:15.451 --> 00:13:17.234
Tear it down?

236
00:13:17.235 --> 00:13:19.585
Yeah, for the new
shopping complex!


237
00:13:19.586 --> 00:13:21.543
This is prime real
estate, you know.


238
00:13:21.544 --> 00:13:23.807
Location, location, location.

239
00:13:26.070 --> 00:13:27.680
You'd me a perfect person
to write an article on it!


240
00:13:27.681 --> 00:13:29.561
Yeah, it would bring some
hype to the mega mall!


241
00:13:31.206 --> 00:13:33.555
Or is that beneath you?

242
00:13:33.556 --> 00:13:37.124
You are little miss famous
now, aren't you?


243
00:13:37.125 --> 00:13:39.518
I have both your novels
on my bedside table.


244
00:13:39.519 --> 00:13:40.780
You've read my books?

245
00:13:40.781 --> 00:13:42.433
Read them?

246
00:13:42.434 --> 00:13:44.523
I inhaled them!

247
00:13:44.524 --> 00:13:46.525
I was so relieved when
Savannah finally left lyndon


248
00:13:46.526 --> 00:13:48.570
to go pursue her own career,

249
00:13:48.571 --> 00:13:50.790
and she can finally start
dating men of a higher caliber


250
00:13:50.791 --> 00:13:54.881
and tax bracket, if you
know what I mean.


251
00:13:54.882 --> 00:13:55.882
Yeah.

252
00:13:56.927 --> 00:13:59.363
Well, my characters await, so...

253
00:13:59.364 --> 00:14:00.104
I should get back to it.

254
00:14:00.105 --> 00:14:01.627
Of course.

255
00:14:01.628 --> 00:14:03.324
But I wouldn't
recommend doing it here.


256
00:14:03.325 --> 00:14:06.066
The contractor's
in and out all day.


257
00:14:06.067 --> 00:14:08.982
Right, for the much
needed shopping mall.


258
00:14:08.983 --> 00:14:09.940
Exactly.

259
00:14:09.940 --> 00:14:10.940
Yeah.

260
00:15:00.600 --> 00:15:02.513
Lyndon and Savannah's
stroll through the Rose garden


261
00:15:02.514 --> 00:15:05.473
became a march down blame Lane.

262
00:15:05.474 --> 00:15:07.257
"I can't believe you'd tear
down the walls of our love


263
00:15:07.258 --> 00:15:09.564
without so much as
running the idea by me first,"


264
00:15:09.565 --> 00:15:10.913
Savannah snaps.

265
00:15:12.873 --> 00:15:14.177
Grace.

266
00:15:14.178 --> 00:15:15.570
"It's just a building, Ramona.

267
00:15:15.571 --> 00:15:17.659
I knew you'd say no,

268
00:15:17.660 --> 00:15:20.270
"so I made an executive
decision," lyndon replies.


269
00:15:20.271 --> 00:15:21.532
"What gives you the right?"

270
00:15:21.533 --> 00:15:22.533
Grace!

271
00:15:23.971 --> 00:15:25.407
I'm sorry, I'm try-

272
00:15:27.017 --> 00:15:28.017
Sean.

273
00:15:31.500 --> 00:15:34.937
Sorry, I just heard your
voice and underwent a...


274
00:15:34.938 --> 00:15:35.938
Minor heart attack.

275
00:15:37.419 --> 00:15:39.072
Were you sitting
there the whole time?


276
00:15:39.073 --> 00:15:40.203
At our tree?

277
00:15:40.204 --> 00:15:41.204
Is this...

278
00:15:42.119 --> 00:15:43.511
Our tree?

279
00:15:44.383 --> 00:15:45.426
It is, I...

280
00:15:45.427 --> 00:15:47.820
No, no, no, I was...

281
00:15:47.821 --> 00:15:51.040
On a work break and I
decided to get some fresh air.


282
00:15:51.041 --> 00:15:52.041
Right.

283
00:15:53.609 --> 00:15:55.262
Wait, you work here?

284
00:15:55.263 --> 00:15:57.351
Yeah, I got my
master's in architecture,


285
00:15:57.352 --> 00:16:00.223
and then, what would you know,

286
00:16:00.224 --> 00:16:03.705
first job I land is
right back at home.


287
00:16:03.706 --> 00:16:05.359
Building the new
shopping complex!


288
00:16:05.360 --> 00:16:06.621
I heard.

289
00:16:06.622 --> 00:16:08.492
No, no, no.

290
00:16:08.493 --> 00:16:10.886
I'm here to make sure
that doesn't happen.


291
00:16:10.887 --> 00:16:13.106
I'm trying to get the old
mansion deemed historic


292
00:16:13.107 --> 00:16:14.368
and save it.

293
00:16:14.369 --> 00:16:15.979
Really? That's amazing!

294
00:16:19.069 --> 00:16:20.722
Uh...

295
00:16:20.723 --> 00:16:22.681
Sorry, I kind of
went a little crazy


296
00:16:22.682 --> 00:16:25.031
when Heather told me
they were tearing it down.


297
00:16:25.032 --> 00:16:26.032
Heather told you?

298
00:16:26.033 --> 00:16:27.686
Can you believe it?

299
00:16:27.687 --> 00:16:29.513
She actually sounded
excited about it too.


300
00:16:29.514 --> 00:16:32.168
Same country Princess as always.

301
00:16:32.169 --> 00:16:33.609
She was a sucker
for outlet stores.


302
00:16:38.262 --> 00:16:40.524
So does this mean you're
gonna the blue moon ball?


303
00:16:40.525 --> 00:16:42.484
I haven't missed one yet.

304
00:16:43.659 --> 00:16:45.486
Are you going?

305
00:16:45.487 --> 00:16:46.487
I am now.

306
00:16:48.708 --> 00:16:51.318
I'm really glad
that I ran into you.


307
00:16:51.319 --> 00:16:53.276
Or bothered you.

308
00:16:53.277 --> 00:16:54.717
At least some
things never changed.


309
00:16:59.414 --> 00:17:01.676
You look really good.

310
00:17:01.677 --> 00:17:03.157
I am really good.

311
00:17:05.725 --> 00:17:07.334
I think you're
supposed to say that...


312
00:17:07.335 --> 00:17:08.422
I look really good too.

313
00:17:10.730 --> 00:17:12.340
Isn't that a given?

314
00:17:15.212 --> 00:17:16.691
Well, I've...

315
00:17:16.692 --> 00:17:18.780
Got to get back to work.

316
00:17:18.781 --> 00:17:21.478
I got to find grounds to
deem the mansion historic,


317
00:17:21.479 --> 00:17:23.654
then write a 20-page proposal.

318
00:17:23.655 --> 00:17:25.526
Save the blue moon ball.

319
00:17:25.527 --> 00:17:26.614
Exactly!

320
00:17:26.615 --> 00:17:28.311
So...

321
00:17:28.312 --> 00:17:31.010
I'll see you around, I guess?

322
00:17:31.011 --> 00:17:32.011
Maybe.

323
00:17:43.153 --> 00:17:44.501
Danny, hey.

324
00:17:44.502 --> 00:17:45.502
Hey.

325
00:17:46.591 --> 00:17:48.592
Can you come to my office?

326
00:17:48.593 --> 00:17:50.681
I want to talk about
the book signing.


327
00:17:50.682 --> 00:17:52.901
I heard through the grapevine
that after selling one book,


328
00:17:52.902 --> 00:17:54.773
you proceeded to pack up early.

329
00:17:54.774 --> 00:17:56.035
Tell me the grapevine lies.

330
00:17:56.036 --> 00:17:57.036
I did.

331
00:17:58.865 --> 00:18:00.474
You told me to go to the
place where I first fell in love,


332
00:18:00.475 --> 00:18:03.042
so I flew home last night.

333
00:18:03.043 --> 00:18:04.957
Flew home?

334
00:18:04.958 --> 00:18:07.524
I was talking about in
your mind, not on a plane.


335
00:18:07.525 --> 00:18:09.352
Oops.

336
00:18:09.353 --> 00:18:10.832
Well, you're there
now, I suppose.


337
00:18:10.833 --> 00:18:12.529
Getting lots of writing done?

338
00:18:12.530 --> 00:18:13.530
Tons!

339
00:18:14.358 --> 00:18:15.663
Great.

340
00:18:15.664 --> 00:18:16.795
Send me the pages by Friday.

341
00:18:16.796 --> 00:18:18.840
Prepare to be amazed.

342
00:18:18.841 --> 00:18:21.625
You know, in this profession,
I prepare for the worst


343
00:18:21.626 --> 00:18:23.192
and I pray for slightly better.

344
00:18:23.193 --> 00:18:24.411
Bye, grace.

345
00:18:25.195 --> 00:18:26.195
By-

346
00:18:30.374 --> 00:18:32.201
- Joe, come here!

347
00:18:43.605 --> 00:18:44.998
Sean!

348
00:18:48.740 --> 00:18:50.480
Hey, Heather.

349
00:18:50.481 --> 00:18:51.655
How was your day?

350
00:18:51.656 --> 00:18:53.354
Oh, good as good can be.

351
00:18:55.008 --> 00:18:56.704
Spent most of it
at the riding club,


352
00:18:56.705 --> 00:18:58.749
practicing dressage with star.

353
00:18:58.750 --> 00:19:00.360
I'm gonna need new gloves soon.

354
00:19:00.361 --> 00:19:01.578
My day was good too.

355
00:19:01.579 --> 00:19:03.493
Thanks for asking.

356
00:19:03.494 --> 00:19:05.582
Somebody's grumpy.

357
00:19:05.583 --> 00:19:07.410
I heard you've been
talking up the shopping mall,


358
00:19:07.411 --> 00:19:09.456
which seems a little strange,

359
00:19:09.457 --> 00:19:13.416
given that it's my job to
make sure that doesn't happen.


360
00:19:13.417 --> 00:19:17.856
It's your first job,
baby boo. A practice run.


361
00:19:17.857 --> 00:19:20.336
Besides, you know how
proud my daddy's gonna be


362
00:19:20.337 --> 00:19:22.469
when you declare
that site a tear-down.


363
00:19:22.470 --> 00:19:24.036
Thanks for the
vote of confidence,


364
00:19:24.037 --> 00:19:26.952
but this mansion is
really important to me.


365
00:19:26.953 --> 00:19:30.564
It's a link to some of this
town's most important history.


366
00:19:30.565 --> 00:19:32.131
It's not a tear-down.

367
00:19:32.132 --> 00:19:34.481
I love that you always
think with your heart,


368
00:19:34.482 --> 00:19:37.397
it's the perfect balance
to overly logical me,


369
00:19:37.398 --> 00:19:39.442
who has no choice
but to point out


370
00:19:39.443 --> 00:19:42.576
that old house hasn't been
used in who knows how long.


371
00:19:42.577 --> 00:19:44.752
It's a financial black hole.

372
00:19:44.753 --> 00:19:48.409
That's why the cassidys
are finally dropping it.


373
00:19:50.019 --> 00:19:51.585
You know, I
heard they're living


374
00:19:51.586 --> 00:19:52.629
in the suburbs
somewhere back east.


375
00:19:52.630 --> 00:19:55.067
The suburbs! Poor things.

376
00:19:55.068 --> 00:19:56.938
People will come
shopping here every day


377
00:19:56.939 --> 00:19:59.549
from all over the
county and beyond.


378
00:19:59.550 --> 00:20:03.771
It'll increase our
town's economy tenfold.


379
00:20:03.772 --> 00:20:06.295
You know, I didn't need
your dad to give me this job.


380
00:20:06.296 --> 00:20:08.558
I can stand on my own two feet.

381
00:20:08.559 --> 00:20:10.518
Of course you can, sweetie.

382
00:20:12.650 --> 00:20:14.956
You ever gonna
stay at your own place?


383
00:20:14.957 --> 00:20:17.176
Why would I do that, silly?

384
00:20:17.177 --> 00:20:20.136
I make this place
just barely livable.


385
00:20:21.442 --> 00:20:22.790
Dinner will be ready in fine

386
00:20:26.751 --> 00:20:28.448
Well!

387
00:20:28.449 --> 00:20:29.797
If it isn't my goddaughter!

388
00:20:29.798 --> 00:20:31.538
Sheriff Carson.

389
00:20:31.539 --> 00:20:33.540
How are you doing, sweetie?

390
00:20:33.541 --> 00:20:35.107
When I heard you
were back in town,


391
00:20:35.108 --> 00:20:36.760
I decided to camp out
in your mom's kitchen.


392
00:20:36.761 --> 00:20:39.676
That way you have no
choice but to say howdy.


393
00:20:39.677 --> 00:20:41.591
Camp out means eat the fridge.

394
00:20:42.593 --> 00:20:44.203
Best fridge in town.

395
00:20:44.204 --> 00:20:45.421
Well, I'd never come
home without visiting


396
00:20:45.422 --> 00:20:47.424
the best storyteller in town.

397
00:20:50.688 --> 00:20:51.775
Um...

398
00:20:51.776 --> 00:20:53.560
How did the writing go?

399
00:20:53.561 --> 00:20:54.841
Did you manage
to stay incognito?


400
00:20:55.346 --> 00:20:56.955
As if.

401
00:20:56.956 --> 00:20:57.999
I had to personally
introduce myself


402
00:20:58.000 --> 00:20:59.740
as the great-great-granddaughter

403
00:20:59.741 --> 00:21:01.568
of the man who helped
build that mansion


404
00:21:01.569 --> 00:21:04.266
to every demolition
contractor in the county.


405
00:21:04.267 --> 00:21:05.876
So you know.

406
00:21:05.877 --> 00:21:07.574
Why didn't you tell me

407
00:21:07.575 --> 00:21:09.663
they were planning
to tear it down?


408
00:21:09.664 --> 00:21:11.534
It's a tragedy, grace, not
one we have any power over.


409
00:21:11.535 --> 00:21:13.972
And it's a reminder
that the blue moon ball


410
00:21:13.973 --> 00:21:15.930
is not about fancy location.

411
00:21:15.931 --> 00:21:17.976
It's about bringing the
community together.


412
00:21:17.977 --> 00:21:19.934
So you're gonna host
the party in your backyard?


413
00:21:19.935 --> 00:21:22.067
If it came to
that, in a heartbeat,


414
00:21:22.068 --> 00:21:24.678
and anyone in town
would do the same thing.


415
00:21:24.679 --> 00:21:26.376
Yes, ma'am, all true.

416
00:21:28.944 --> 00:21:29.944
Sean's trying to have
the mansion deemed


417
00:21:29.945 --> 00:21:31.555
as a historical site.

418
00:21:34.297 --> 00:21:35.298
Right. Sean.

419
00:21:37.300 --> 00:21:39.693
I was wondering when
your two paths would cross.


420
00:21:39.694 --> 00:21:41.347
Do you think there's any
chance he'll manage to save it?


421
00:21:41.348 --> 00:21:42.739
Well, Sean's a smart man.

422
00:21:42.740 --> 00:21:44.654
The town's lucky to have him.

423
00:21:44.655 --> 00:21:46.874
That said, he's not
exactly the persuasive type.


424
00:21:48.050 --> 00:21:49.833
That's definitely true.

425
00:21:49.834 --> 00:21:50.705
He could never get
me to do anything.


426
00:21:50.706 --> 00:21:52.793
Yes, I know that.

427
00:21:52.794 --> 00:21:55.665
You were always the ring
leader with the bright ideas.


428
00:21:55.666 --> 00:21:57.493
You know, I remember
the time you and Sean


429
00:21:57.494 --> 00:21:59.582
stole that fire hose

430
00:21:59.583 --> 00:22:00.801
and flooded out old man
Jeremiah's taxidermy shop.


431
00:22:00.802 --> 00:22:01.802
Woo hoo hoo hoo!

432
00:22:01.803 --> 00:22:03.456
He was hopping mad!

433
00:22:03.457 --> 00:22:05.153
Don't encourage her.

434
00:22:05.154 --> 00:22:07.025
Like two peas in
a pod of mischief.


435
00:22:07.026 --> 00:22:09.505
I plead the fifth.

436
00:22:17.949 --> 00:22:18.949
Hey, phone?

437
00:22:19.822 --> 00:22:20.864
Yes?

438
00:22:20.865 --> 00:22:21.996
What does love mean?

439
00:22:24.043 --> 00:22:25.086
An intense
feeling of deep affection.


440
00:22:25.087 --> 00:22:27.001
Example: His love of football.

441
00:22:33.704 --> 00:22:35.618
Grace montague speaking.

442
00:22:35.619 --> 00:22:37.403
Hey, grace, it's James.

443
00:22:37.404 --> 00:22:38.969
Hey!

444
00:22:38.970 --> 00:22:40.101
You'll never
guess where I'm at.


445
00:22:40.102 --> 00:22:42.496
Back at the scene of the crime.

446
00:22:44.628 --> 00:22:46.368
Look, I know it's a
little bit late for brunch,


447
00:22:46.369 --> 00:22:48.762
but my work is taking me
out of the city tomorrow.


448
00:22:48.763 --> 00:22:50.764
So, if you're free tonight,

449
00:22:50.765 --> 00:22:52.592
maybe we could
squeeze in that date.


450
00:22:52.593 --> 00:22:55.508
I'm actually not
in la right now.


451
00:22:55.509 --> 00:22:58.511
I'm on a bit of a
work trip myself.


452
00:22:58.512 --> 00:23:01.644
Oh, well, yeah, I
knew it was a long shot.


453
00:23:01.645 --> 00:23:03.864
Um...

454
00:23:03.865 --> 00:23:05.779
Weird question for you.
But I was just wondering,


455
00:23:05.780 --> 00:23:09.261
how do you know when to
stop diagnosing a patient?


456
00:23:09.262 --> 00:23:12.090
Like, how do you know
when you're done testing them


457
00:23:12.091 --> 00:23:15.136
and you can just treat
them for what you think it is?


458
00:23:15.137 --> 00:23:17.182
There's no hard and fast rule.

459
00:23:17.183 --> 00:23:19.445
When I've exhausted all
the possibilities I can think of.


460
00:23:19.446 --> 00:23:21.317
Then I just trust my gut.

461
00:23:23.014 --> 00:23:24.841
Does your next romance
novel need a doctor?


462
00:23:26.105 --> 00:23:29.019
No, but that actually helped.

463
00:23:29.020 --> 00:23:30.412
Thanks, James.

464
00:23:30.413 --> 00:23:31.153
Have a good night.

465
00:23:31.154 --> 00:23:32.675
You too.

466
00:23:32.676 --> 00:23:33.676
Bye, grace.

467
00:23:39.118 --> 00:23:40.118
Hey, phone?

468
00:23:40.859 --> 00:23:42.207
Yes?

469
00:23:42.208 --> 00:23:43.512
How to write a
persuasive study


470
00:23:43.513 --> 00:23:44.992
on historical property value.

471
00:23:47.213 --> 00:23:50.737
- Approved historical property
applications: 1,021 entries.


472
00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:53.280
Hey, phone, email links to me.

473
00:23:54.176 --> 00:23:55.176
Emailing links.

474
00:24:04.578 --> 00:24:05.970
Mom, are you awake?

475
00:24:11.498 --> 00:24:12.759
Mom.

476
00:24:12.760 --> 00:24:14.108
Are you awake?

477
00:24:14.109 --> 00:24:14.849
What happened?
What time is it?


478
00:24:14.850 --> 00:24:15.892
5:00 A.M.!

479
00:24:16.981 --> 00:24:19.069
I've been up all night

480
00:24:19.070 --> 00:24:20.070
trying to figure out how to
help Sean win a zoning permit,


481
00:24:20.071 --> 00:24:21.898
and I think I've done it.

482
00:24:21.899 --> 00:24:23.900
So you're an architect now?

483
00:24:23.901 --> 00:24:25.206
I know!

484
00:24:25.207 --> 00:24:27.121
But like sheriff Carson said,

485
00:24:27.122 --> 00:24:28.905
Sean doesn't need an
architect; He needs a writer.


486
00:24:28.906 --> 00:24:29.950
And I'm a writer!

487
00:24:29.951 --> 00:24:30.778
I'm persuasive!

488
00:24:30.778 --> 00:24:31.692
And loud.

489
00:24:31.693 --> 00:24:32.735
Yeah.

490
00:24:34.434 --> 00:24:37.044
You know, grace,
this is a noble project,


491
00:24:37.045 --> 00:24:38.219
but do you think
it's a good idea


492
00:24:38.220 --> 00:24:40.308
to be working with Sean again?

493
00:24:40.309 --> 00:24:41.875
I mean, I remember
when you two broke up.


494
00:24:41.876 --> 00:24:44.182
It just really hurt you.

495
00:24:44.183 --> 00:24:45.835
It was years ago.

496
00:24:45.836 --> 00:24:47.097
We were just kids.

497
00:24:47.098 --> 00:24:48.316
We've grown past all that.

498
00:24:48.317 --> 00:24:50.362
Yeah, but what
about your work?


499
00:24:50.363 --> 00:24:52.886
Don't you have a deadline
the night of the ball?


500
00:24:52.887 --> 00:24:54.975
Shouldn't you stay focused?

501
00:24:54.976 --> 00:24:56.759
I can do both.

502
00:24:56.760 --> 00:24:58.631
See?

503
00:24:58.632 --> 00:24:59.546
Did you see?

504
00:24:59.547 --> 00:25:01.199
Oh.

505
00:25:13.342 --> 00:25:14.213
I didn't know they
taught the two-step


506
00:25:14.214 --> 00:25:16.040
at architectural school.

507
00:25:17.346 --> 00:25:19.304
Whoever built this place

508
00:25:19.305 --> 00:25:21.872
knew exactly what
they were doing.


509
00:25:24.005 --> 00:25:25.875
This house is built
with a sprung floor


510
00:25:25.876 --> 00:25:27.573
that absorbs shock.

511
00:25:27.574 --> 00:25:29.402
So when I lift you up...

512
00:25:31.621 --> 00:25:33.622
And then drop you back down...

513
00:25:33.623 --> 00:25:34.928
I don't break an ankle.

514
00:25:34.929 --> 00:25:35.929
Exactly.

515
00:25:45.287 --> 00:25:47.550
I want to tell you something.

516
00:25:48.943 --> 00:25:49.943
Yeah?

517
00:25:52.947 --> 00:25:54.687
I was hired for this job

518
00:25:54.688 --> 00:25:58.168
because the
contractor knew I'd fail.


519
00:25:58.169 --> 00:26:00.736
It's my first job with the firm.

520
00:26:00.737 --> 00:26:02.825
I'm a newbie.

521
00:26:02.826 --> 00:26:04.349
How would the contractor
possibly know that?


522
00:26:04.350 --> 00:26:07.526
The contractor
is Heather's dad.


523
00:26:07.527 --> 00:26:08.962
Ugh!

524
00:26:08.963 --> 00:26:10.965
Classic small-town nepotism.

525
00:26:12.749 --> 00:26:15.273
I'm glad you came home.

526
00:26:15.274 --> 00:26:17.100
Might be your last
chance to say goodbye


527
00:26:17.101 --> 00:26:18.712
if I botch this job.

528
00:26:20.844 --> 00:26:23.019
My mom used to tell me stories

529
00:26:23.020 --> 00:26:26.284
that my great-great-grandpa
helped build that red barn.


530
00:26:26.285 --> 00:26:27.807
How could such a precious place

531
00:26:27.808 --> 00:26:30.070
not have any
historical significance?


532
00:26:30.071 --> 00:26:32.246
That's so weird!

533
00:26:32.247 --> 00:26:35.423
No, my family used to tell
me the exact same story.


534
00:26:35.424 --> 00:26:37.599
Maybe our ancestors
built it together.


535
00:26:37.600 --> 00:26:39.949
And maybe that's why we
need to work together now.


536
00:26:39.950 --> 00:26:42.082
We're not gonna let some
rich country bureaucrats


537
00:26:42.083 --> 00:26:44.171
take over our town!

538
00:26:44.172 --> 00:26:46.478
If you can prove what
makes the site historical,


539
00:26:46.479 --> 00:26:48.915
I'll come up with
the arguing proposal.


540
00:26:48.916 --> 00:26:50.133
What do you say?

541
00:26:50.700 --> 00:26:51.700
Team?

542
00:26:57.054 --> 00:26:58.054
Team.

543
00:27:02.059 --> 00:27:04.104
So what's first on the list?

544
00:27:04.105 --> 00:27:07.107
Library archives or a town-wide
save-the-mansion petition?


545
00:27:07.108 --> 00:27:09.327
Actually, I noticed
a quarter wall panel


546
00:27:09.328 --> 00:27:11.154
that looks a little too new.

547
00:27:11.155 --> 00:27:12.155
So it's been updated.

548
00:27:12.156 --> 00:27:13.940
That's good, right?

549
00:27:13.941 --> 00:27:16.029
Yeah, but it only
takes up half the wall.


550
00:27:16.030 --> 00:27:16.900
So it's covering something up?

551
00:27:16.901 --> 00:27:18.771
Exactly.

552
00:27:18.772 --> 00:27:20.512
Fingers crossed
it's not black mold.


553
00:27:20.513 --> 00:27:21.730
Well, I'm gonna head
home and grab some tools.


554
00:27:21.731 --> 00:27:23.123
I'm gonna get that paneling off.

555
00:27:23.124 --> 00:27:25.865
Great! I can
see your new digs.


556
00:27:25.866 --> 00:27:29.259
Actually, I've had
a bit of an infestation.


557
00:27:29.260 --> 00:27:31.044
Mice?

558
00:27:31.045 --> 00:27:32.262
Something like that.

559
00:27:32.263 --> 00:27:34.787
I'll drop you off at home and...

560
00:27:34.788 --> 00:27:36.092
We can meet up later.

561
00:27:36.093 --> 00:27:37.790
Yeah, yeah, that sounds great.

562
00:27:37.791 --> 00:27:41.054
I have some writing
to do anyway, so...


563
00:27:41.055 --> 00:27:42.838
No way!

564
00:27:42.839 --> 00:27:45.624
You're still driving Jess?

565
00:27:45.625 --> 00:27:46.625
Of course!

566
00:27:50.412 --> 00:27:53.458
You put some work into her.

567
00:27:53.459 --> 00:27:56.504
Ah, there's no more hole
in the passenger seat.


568
00:27:56.505 --> 00:27:58.506
You don't need that
old striped pillow anymore.


569
00:27:58.507 --> 00:28:01.944
Oh yeah! I totally
forgot about that thing.


570
00:28:01.945 --> 00:28:04.338
Got new mud tires on her too.

571
00:28:04.339 --> 00:28:05.513
Must be the season.

572
00:28:05.514 --> 00:28:07.210
Heather was just telling me

573
00:28:07.211 --> 00:28:09.605
that she got the same
thing for her truck.


574
00:28:12.956 --> 00:28:14.217
Her truck.

575
00:28:14.218 --> 00:28:15.218
Great.

576
00:28:16.133 --> 00:28:17.133
Mom?

577
00:28:18.919 --> 00:28:20.354
I have a problem.

578
00:28:22.096 --> 00:28:23.575
As a kid, you would
always say that


579
00:28:23.576 --> 00:28:25.315
when you didn't know
how to finish a story.


580
00:28:25.316 --> 00:28:27.013
Well, at least with a story,

581
00:28:27.014 --> 00:28:28.536
I can always erase
it and try again.


582
00:28:28.537 --> 00:28:29.885
Those look lovely, by the way.

583
00:28:29.886 --> 00:28:31.583
Thank you.

584
00:28:31.584 --> 00:28:33.802
With this, if I mess
up, there's no do-over,


585
00:28:33.803 --> 00:28:35.978
no back button.

586
00:28:35.979 --> 00:28:38.154
And exactly what problem
is it we're discussing?


587
00:28:38.155 --> 00:28:39.155
Sean.

588
00:28:40.288 --> 00:28:42.332
He's acting all weird and aloof.

589
00:28:42.333 --> 00:28:44.160
Well, you know, maybe his life

590
00:28:44.161 --> 00:28:46.511
is a little more
complicated than you think.


591
00:28:46.512 --> 00:28:47.903
What do you mean?

592
00:28:47.904 --> 00:28:49.383
Well, I'm not one to pry

593
00:28:49.384 --> 00:28:51.603
into other people's
affairs, but...


594
00:28:51.604 --> 00:28:55.476
You know, your history
together is complex.


595
00:28:55.477 --> 00:28:57.260
Technically, I guess we
never called off our engagement,


596
00:28:57.261 --> 00:28:58.348
but that was years ago.

597
00:28:58.349 --> 00:29:00.350
Mm-hm. And now?

598
00:29:00.351 --> 00:29:03.615
Now we're working together...

599
00:29:03.616 --> 00:29:05.181
And it just feels
like all those years


600
00:29:05.182 --> 00:29:08.054
of being best friends
never happened.


601
00:29:08.055 --> 00:29:10.056
It I'll just makes
me feel more...


602
00:29:10.057 --> 00:29:11.187
Interested?

603
00:29:11.188 --> 00:29:12.188
Confused.

604
00:29:14.017 --> 00:29:15.801
Are you still
in love with him?


605
00:29:15.802 --> 00:29:16.802
No!

606
00:29:19.327 --> 00:29:22.982
I'm in like,
emphasis on the like.


607
00:29:22.983 --> 00:29:25.201
And I have no idea if
he feels the same way.


608
00:29:25.202 --> 00:29:27.203
Do you remember
when you started writing?


609
00:29:27.204 --> 00:29:28.509
No.

610
00:29:28.510 --> 00:29:30.642
It was after your father died.

611
00:29:30.643 --> 00:29:32.774
You needed to just sort
through your feelings,


612
00:29:32.775 --> 00:29:34.428
write them out.

613
00:29:34.429 --> 00:29:37.171
So the stories and
the poems were fiction.


614
00:29:38.477 --> 00:29:40.609
But your emotions were real.

615
00:29:44.178 --> 00:29:46.179
So you think I should journal?

616
00:29:46.180 --> 00:29:48.790
I think it would give
you the clarity you need.


617
00:29:48.791 --> 00:29:50.531
Thanks, mom.

618
00:29:50.532 --> 00:29:53.491
You always have the best advice.

619
00:30:20.214 --> 00:30:22.084
Hey Sean!

620
00:30:22.085 --> 00:30:23.216
You still want to
see a movie tonight?


621
00:30:23.217 --> 00:30:25.435
Yeah, yeah. Just one sec.

622
00:30:25.436 --> 00:30:26.785
What's with all the letters?

623
00:30:26.786 --> 00:30:27.873
I just...

624
00:30:27.874 --> 00:30:30.223
Nothing. Just junk mail.

625
00:30:30.224 --> 00:30:32.008
Makes good fire starter.

626
00:30:33.662 --> 00:30:36.360
What movie are we
seeing again tonight?


627
00:30:47.284 --> 00:30:48.284
Okay.

628
00:30:52.594 --> 00:30:55.075
What do I want to
say about Sean?


629
00:30:56.816 --> 00:30:59.949
It depends on what
he has to say about me.


630
00:31:27.934 --> 00:31:29.021
Hello?

631
00:31:29.022 --> 00:31:31.197
Hey! Are you busy?

632
00:31:31.198 --> 00:31:32.981
If you consider staring at a
blank computer screen busy,


633
00:31:32.982 --> 00:31:34.374
then yes.

634
00:31:34.375 --> 00:31:35.418
Sounds rough.

635
00:31:35.419 --> 00:31:37.203
Yeah. I need a break.

636
00:31:37.204 --> 00:31:39.379
Good. You're never
gonna believe this.


637
00:31:39.380 --> 00:31:40.381
What is it?

638
00:31:47.954 --> 00:31:49.129
What is all this?

639
00:31:53.350 --> 00:31:55.047
It looks like an old doorway

640
00:31:55.048 --> 00:31:57.745
that someone filled in,
and some vandalism.


641
00:31:57.746 --> 00:32:00.139
I don't think it's vandalism.

642
00:32:00.140 --> 00:32:02.532
An old tradition, maybe.

643
00:32:02.533 --> 00:32:05.058
Names and hearts. Past lovers?

644
00:32:07.190 --> 00:32:08.626
Okay, what were your
grandparents' names?


645
00:32:08.627 --> 00:32:10.759
Albert and Marjorie. Why?

646
00:32:12.195 --> 00:32:14.241
Do you think this was them?

647
00:32:16.069 --> 00:32:17.635
There's only
one way to find out.


648
00:32:17.636 --> 00:32:18.593
They're still alive?

649
00:32:18.594 --> 00:32:20.289
Grandpa Albert is.

650
00:32:20.290 --> 00:32:22.291
Present's a little tricky,

651
00:32:22.292 --> 00:32:24.554
but the past he knows
like the back of his hand.


652
00:32:24.555 --> 00:32:27.253
You up for a trip
down memory Lane?


653
00:32:27.254 --> 00:32:29.516
On one condition.

654
00:32:29.517 --> 00:32:31.344
Anything from
my partner in crime.


655
00:32:31.345 --> 00:32:33.172
I get to drive Jess.

656
00:32:38.308 --> 00:32:40.483
I really appreciate
you doing this, grace,


657
00:32:40.484 --> 00:32:41.659
especially when you
have work of your own


658
00:32:41.660 --> 00:32:44.096
you've got to get back to.

659
00:32:44.097 --> 00:32:46.402
I wouldn't exactly
consider this work.


660
00:32:46.403 --> 00:32:47.403
Lucky!

661
00:32:49.406 --> 00:32:51.538
I barely slept with all the
thoughts racing through my mind.


662
00:32:51.539 --> 00:32:54.454
I mean, there's really only
two ways we can go, right?


663
00:32:54.455 --> 00:32:56.282
You're right.

664
00:32:56.283 --> 00:32:58.067
We save her or we don't.

665
00:33:01.375 --> 00:33:05.945
Hey, I'm really doing everything
I can to save the mansion.


666
00:33:07.903 --> 00:33:09.512
I know I screwed up and
disappointed you in the past,


667
00:33:09.513 --> 00:33:12.341
but I'll try not to let
that happen again.


668
00:33:12.342 --> 00:33:14.474
Disappointed me?

669
00:33:14.475 --> 00:33:18.217
Sean, I sent you about

670
00:33:18.218 --> 00:33:20.698
countless embarrassing
late-night voicemails,


671
00:33:20.699 --> 00:33:22.569
and you couldn't so
much as call me back?


672
00:33:22.570 --> 00:33:24.353
But...

673
00:33:24.354 --> 00:33:26.138
You never came back!

674
00:33:26.139 --> 00:33:27.748
I was chasing my
dreams to be a writer!


675
00:33:27.749 --> 00:33:30.620
You said you wanted that for me.

676
00:33:30.621 --> 00:33:31.621
And I did!

677
00:33:33.233 --> 00:33:34.712
So I don't get it.

678
00:33:34.713 --> 00:33:36.584
You're not making sense.

679
00:33:38.760 --> 00:33:41.328
I really screwed up, didn't I?

680
00:33:48.639 --> 00:33:49.683
You did.

681
00:33:54.167 --> 00:33:55.124
Do you think it's
too late to fix it?


682
00:33:55.125 --> 00:33:56.646
Fix it?

683
00:33:56.647 --> 00:33:57.996
I still have the bolt, Sean.

684
00:33:57.997 --> 00:33:59.127
Get down!

685
00:33:59.128 --> 00:34:00.650
What?

686
00:34:00.651 --> 00:34:01.348
Your hair!
There's a bug in it!


687
00:34:01.349 --> 00:34:02.391
Let me get it!

688
00:34:02.392 --> 00:34:03.002
There's a-

689
00:34:03.003 --> 00:34:04.698
ew!

690
00:34:04.699 --> 00:34:07.048
Ew, ew, ew! Get
it out, get it out!


691
00:34:07.049 --> 00:34:08.441
Did you get it?

692
00:34:08.442 --> 00:34:09.312
Sean!

693
00:34:09.313 --> 00:34:10.704
Got it.

694
00:34:10.705 --> 00:34:12.227
Let me see it!

695
00:34:12.228 --> 00:34:13.533
I smashed it.

696
00:34:13.534 --> 00:34:14.577
Wait here.

697
00:34:14.578 --> 00:34:16.189
I'm gonna get grandpa.

698
00:34:17.146 --> 00:34:18.146
Yeah.

699
00:34:19.540 --> 00:34:21.020
You go get grandpa.

700
00:34:41.257 --> 00:34:42.780
Hi, Mrs. Montague!

701
00:34:42.781 --> 00:34:44.825
Oh, well, Heather! Hello!

702
00:34:44.826 --> 00:34:46.653
Did you jog all the way here?

703
00:34:46.654 --> 00:34:48.133
Exercise keeps me focused.

704
00:34:48.134 --> 00:34:49.917
I love the determination.

705
00:34:49.918 --> 00:34:51.484
What brings you out to the area?

706
00:34:51.485 --> 00:34:53.791
Well, it's a town-wide survey,

707
00:34:53.792 --> 00:34:55.705
I want to know exactly
what kind of stores


708
00:34:55.706 --> 00:34:57.838
this town wants to
see in the new mall.


709
00:34:57.839 --> 00:35:02.495
A new tech shop, a trendy
cafe, arts boutiques, you name it.


710
00:35:02.496 --> 00:35:04.323
I'm very sorry, Heather.

711
00:35:04.324 --> 00:35:06.368
I just don't think it's
right I take the survey.


712
00:35:06.369 --> 00:35:09.763
Grace and I are dead set
against the mansion demolition.


713
00:35:09.764 --> 00:35:11.591
Well, that's all right.

714
00:35:11.592 --> 00:35:14.072
You have a great
day, Mrs. Montague.


715
00:35:14.073 --> 00:35:15.073
You too.

716
00:35:17.859 --> 00:35:19.077
Mrs. Montague?

717
00:35:19.078 --> 00:35:21.035
Yes, dear?

718
00:35:21.036 --> 00:35:24.387
Grace is really lucky to
have such a supportive mom.


719
00:35:25.867 --> 00:35:27.215
How are you feeling?

720
00:35:27.216 --> 00:35:28.738
How they treating you in there?

721
00:35:28.739 --> 00:35:30.392
Well, I can't
complain, you know.


722
00:35:30.393 --> 00:35:32.438
I mean, I started
out with nothing,


723
00:35:32.439 --> 00:35:34.570
and I still have
most of it left.


724
00:35:36.704 --> 00:35:37.618
You're doing
great. I mean, look at you.


725
00:35:37.619 --> 00:35:39.445
Well, you know.

726
00:35:39.446 --> 00:35:40.576
Grandpa Albert,
this is the friend


727
00:35:40.577 --> 00:35:41.664
I was telling you about, grace.

728
00:35:41.665 --> 00:35:43.101
Who? Speak up.

729
00:35:43.102 --> 00:35:43.754
Grace!

730
00:35:43.755 --> 00:35:45.103
Eh?

731
00:35:45.104 --> 00:35:46.452
Oh!

732
00:35:46.453 --> 00:35:47.671
Marjorie, my dear!

733
00:35:48.847 --> 00:35:50.978
Let's go to the races!

734
00:35:50.979 --> 00:35:53.459
Grandpa Albert, that's
not Marjorie. She's-


735
00:35:53.460 --> 00:35:55.200
- at the riding club.

736
00:35:55.201 --> 00:35:57.985
Oh, at the riding club?

737
00:35:57.986 --> 00:36:00.161
Well, of course she is.

738
00:36:00.162 --> 00:36:01.641
I'm sorry, dear.

739
00:36:01.642 --> 00:36:03.469
My mistake.

740
00:36:03.470 --> 00:36:04.384
I guess the green
family loving me


741
00:36:04.385 --> 00:36:05.863
must be a genetic trait.

742
00:36:07.822 --> 00:36:09.605
Taxi driver...

743
00:36:09.606 --> 00:36:12.652
Take me to the mansion gardens!

744
00:36:12.653 --> 00:36:16.264
I haven't seen a
blooming lilac in years.


745
00:36:16.265 --> 00:36:17.265
Yes, sir.

746
00:36:22.445 --> 00:36:25.883
Oh, what a time to be alive.

747
00:36:25.884 --> 00:36:28.015
- Grandpa?
- Eh?


748
00:36:28.016 --> 00:36:30.844
I wanted to ask you
about the blue moon ball.


749
00:36:30.845 --> 00:36:32.280
Do you remember it?

750
00:36:32.281 --> 00:36:34.457
Well, of course I remember it!

751
00:36:36.764 --> 00:36:41.029
Dancing under the blue moon
is how every man in this town


752
00:36:42.378 --> 00:36:43.944
found the love of his life,

753
00:36:43.945 --> 00:36:46.382
glowing under Luna's soft kiss.

754
00:36:49.559 --> 00:36:51.299
That's beautiful.

755
00:36:51.300 --> 00:36:52.866
Is that how you met Marjorie?

756
00:36:52.867 --> 00:36:55.174
Oh, no, no, we
grew up together.


757
00:36:57.045 --> 00:36:58.959
We were in the same class

758
00:36:58.960 --> 00:37:02.442
all the way from kindergarten
through graduation.


759
00:37:04.226 --> 00:37:05.271
Just like us.

760
00:37:07.142 --> 00:37:09.491
Albert, we were
wondering about the mansion.


761
00:37:09.492 --> 00:37:11.015
We found some carved initials,
and we were just wondering


762
00:37:11.016 --> 00:37:13.495
if they had any
sort of significance.


763
00:37:13.496 --> 00:37:15.323
Significance?

764
00:37:16.586 --> 00:37:18.674
It's a tradition!

765
00:37:18.675 --> 00:37:21.113
As old as the blue moon itself.

766
00:37:23.115 --> 00:37:26.422
Legend had it that if a young
man would carve his name


767
00:37:28.207 --> 00:37:30.861
next to the name of
the woman he loved,


768
00:37:32.602 --> 00:37:34.647
they would be
brought together again


769
00:37:34.648 --> 00:37:36.519
under the next blue moon,

770
00:37:37.868 --> 00:37:39.478
and the moon would see to it,

771
00:37:39.479 --> 00:37:41.523
no matter what
the circumstances,


772
00:37:41.524 --> 00:37:45.398
that their paths would
cross and their love blossom.


773
00:37:46.573 --> 00:37:48.443
Does it work?

774
00:37:48.444 --> 00:37:50.489
Ask Marjorie.

775
00:37:50.490 --> 00:37:52.622
We've been married since 1960.

776
00:37:54.929 --> 00:37:56.886
Why are you asking
all these questions


777
00:37:56.887 --> 00:37:59.368
about the blue moon ball anyway?

778
00:38:00.500 --> 00:38:02.849
Grandpa Albert...

779
00:38:02.850 --> 00:38:07.419
There are some people who
want to tear the mansion down.


780
00:38:07.420 --> 00:38:09.247
Me and grace,
we're trying to gather


781
00:38:09.248 --> 00:38:12.337
as much information as we
can to stop that from happening.


782
00:38:12.338 --> 00:38:13.600
That's criminal!

783
00:38:18.257 --> 00:38:19.344
Grandpa!

784
00:38:19.345 --> 00:38:20.736
Where are you going?

785
00:38:20.737 --> 00:38:21.737
The study!

786
00:38:23.001 --> 00:38:24.001
There's a study?

787
00:38:24.002 --> 00:38:25.525
Not that I know of.

788
00:38:30.008 --> 00:38:31.051
Grandpa, where are you going?

789
00:38:31.052 --> 00:38:32.140
You'll see.

790
00:38:39.930 --> 00:38:41.541
Prepare to be amazed.

791
00:38:52.682 --> 00:38:54.554
Nice work, Sean.

792
00:38:55.642 --> 00:38:56.990
That's a boy.

793
00:38:56.991 --> 00:38:58.253
Ah, here we go.

794
00:39:01.474 --> 00:39:02.823
Whoa-ho, here it is.

795
00:39:07.610 --> 00:39:09.133
Is this an original
map of our town?


796
00:39:09.134 --> 00:39:11.526
Uh-huh.

797
00:39:11.527 --> 00:39:12.354
It can't be.

798
00:39:12.355 --> 00:39:13.920
The year's 1831.

799
00:39:13.921 --> 00:39:16.009
We weren't found until 1845.

800
00:39:16.010 --> 00:39:18.142
That's right.

801
00:39:18.143 --> 00:39:21.580
The original founder of
this land, Austin Hastings,


802
00:39:21.581 --> 00:39:24.496
bought over 10,000 acres

803
00:39:24.497 --> 00:39:28.195
and built this
mansion for his wife.


804
00:39:28.196 --> 00:39:31.633
They knew they had
something special here,


805
00:39:31.634 --> 00:39:33.679
so they started
giving land deeds


806
00:39:33.680 --> 00:39:36.073
to some of the
struggling local farmers


807
00:39:36.074 --> 00:39:38.640
to foster a community.

808
00:39:38.641 --> 00:39:42.341
He envisioned a town,
and this is what it became.


809
00:39:45.126 --> 00:39:48.346
Enough to have to have
it declared a historic site?


810
00:39:48.347 --> 00:39:50.739
I mean, if we can
find the original deeds,


811
00:39:50.740 --> 00:39:52.567
I don't see why not.

812
00:39:52.568 --> 00:39:55.744
Find 'em?

813
00:39:55.745 --> 00:39:58.660
My grandpa used to bring
me here to the mansion


814
00:39:58.661 --> 00:40:01.534
when I was a child
for history lessons.


815
00:40:03.753 --> 00:40:06.625
Now, Mr. Hastings kept
every document he ever had


816
00:40:06.626 --> 00:40:08.410
right here in this desk.

817
00:40:10.717 --> 00:40:11.717
There you go.

818
00:40:16.331 --> 00:40:19.986
Look, we're all here. The
montagues, the Greens.


819
00:40:19.987 --> 00:40:22.162
As a gesture of appreciation,

820
00:40:22.163 --> 00:40:25.949
the local farmers built
Mr. Hastings the red barn.


821
00:40:30.911 --> 00:40:31.912
Grace, I...

822
00:40:34.044 --> 00:40:35.871
I wanna ask you something.

823
00:40:35.872 --> 00:40:36.872
Yeah?

824
00:40:37.918 --> 00:40:39.485
It's kinda awkward.

825
00:40:42.183 --> 00:40:43.836
I'm more just
asking for a friend.


826
00:40:43.837 --> 00:40:45.969
Oh, well, yeah, let's hear it.

827
00:40:49.190 --> 00:40:51.757
He has this girlfriend...

828
00:40:51.758 --> 00:40:54.804
And she was supposed
to be just a rebound


829
00:40:56.893 --> 00:41:00.287
to help him get over the
biggest heartbreak of his life.


830
00:41:00.288 --> 00:41:02.856
But that rebound
turned out to be


831
00:41:04.553 --> 00:41:07.860
more permanent than he expected.

832
00:41:07.861 --> 00:41:11.255
And he's been trying to break
up with her for months now,


833
00:41:11.256 --> 00:41:14.781
but he doesn't want to
hurt anyone's feelings.


834
00:41:17.175 --> 00:41:19.698
Us girls are
tougher than we look.


835
00:41:19.699 --> 00:41:21.308
You should just
be honest with her.


836
00:41:21.309 --> 00:41:23.920
No one likes
getting strung along.


837
00:41:25.139 --> 00:41:26.836
Do I know this couple?

838
00:41:27.924 --> 00:41:29.664
Yeah.

839
00:41:29.665 --> 00:41:31.927
It's Heather actually.

840
00:41:31.928 --> 00:41:34.060
Ugh.

841
00:41:34.061 --> 00:41:37.020
I pity the man who's ever
crossed paths with her.


842
00:41:41.721 --> 00:41:42.721
Me too.

843
00:41:47.814 --> 00:41:49.031
Pot hole!

844
00:41:58.216 --> 00:42:00.042
I don't know about you,

845
00:42:00.043 --> 00:42:01.957
but I'd sooner take a
pothole over a ticket.


846
00:42:01.958 --> 00:42:04.221
It's Jess we're talking about.

847
00:42:04.222 --> 00:42:06.962
You've got me there.

848
00:42:06.963 --> 00:42:09.182
Just let me do
the talking. It's fine.


849
00:42:26.244 --> 00:42:29.637
Sorry, officer. I was
just avoiding a pothole.


850
00:42:29.638 --> 00:42:31.335
Mm-hm.

851
00:42:31.336 --> 00:42:32.727
Well, grace, I know
these country roads


852
00:42:32.728 --> 00:42:35.164
aren't as pristine as la.

853
00:42:35.165 --> 00:42:36.731
That with some
pretty erratic driving,


854
00:42:36.732 --> 00:42:39.038
even for the likes of this town,

855
00:42:39.039 --> 00:42:41.040
not to mention
you're in the company


856
00:42:41.041 --> 00:42:44.261
of one of the most notorious
party boys in these parts.


857
00:42:44.262 --> 00:42:45.784
Sean?

858
00:42:45.785 --> 00:42:47.089
Me?

859
00:42:47.090 --> 00:42:48.917
No, I'm talking about Albert.

860
00:42:48.918 --> 00:42:50.310
Best square dance caller I know.

861
00:42:52.182 --> 00:42:54.532
So, to ensure that we
keep the streets safe,


862
00:42:54.533 --> 00:42:58.362
I'm gonna need you to prove
that you haven't been drinking.


863
00:42:58.363 --> 00:43:00.059
Hop on out of the
car, miss montague.


864
00:43:00.060 --> 00:43:01.540
You, too, partner.

865
00:43:04.499 --> 00:43:06.195
What can I do
for you, sheriff?


866
00:43:06.196 --> 00:43:07.240
Want me to walk the line?

867
00:43:07.241 --> 00:43:09.460
Not quite, grace.

868
00:43:09.461 --> 00:43:12.245
I've found line dance is a
much better judge of sobriety.


869
00:43:13.247 --> 00:43:15.074
You're kidding!

870
00:43:15.075 --> 00:43:16.989
I don't even remember
how to line dance!


871
00:43:16.990 --> 00:43:17.947
Maybe your good friend
Sean here can remind you.


872
00:43:17.948 --> 00:43:19.470
Come on. Hop to it.

873
00:43:19.471 --> 00:43:21.031
It was the line
dance king in the day.


874
00:43:23.692 --> 00:43:24.823
Cowboy up!

875
00:43:24.824 --> 00:43:25.781
Come on!

876
00:43:25.782 --> 00:43:28.218
Oh!

877
00:43:33.267 --> 00:43:34.963
I haven't done this
since the last ball.


878
00:43:34.964 --> 00:43:37.139
I can't believe my feet
even know what to do.


879
00:43:37.140 --> 00:43:40.839
It's not your
feet. It's your heart.


880
00:43:50.893 --> 00:43:51.893
Sweetie?

881
00:43:52.939 --> 00:43:55.070
Are you awake?

882
00:43:55.071 --> 00:43:58.247
I know you've been up for
hours writing, but I made cookies.


883
00:44:00.381 --> 00:44:02.470
Oatmeal raisin! My favorite!

884
00:44:04.516 --> 00:44:06.255
I thought you were in your
room. Did you sneak out?


885
00:44:06.256 --> 00:44:08.562
Sneak out?

886
00:44:08.563 --> 00:44:10.347
I hate to burst your bubble,
mom, but I'm not 16 anymore.


887
00:44:10.348 --> 00:44:13.219
No, six is a better estimate.

888
00:44:13.220 --> 00:44:15.134
Come on.

889
00:44:15.135 --> 00:44:16.483
I want to tell you about
my ideas for the mansion


890
00:44:16.484 --> 00:44:17.745
that required your
wisdom and expertise.


891
00:44:17.746 --> 00:44:19.007
Oh.

892
00:44:25.406 --> 00:44:26.972
Sean says the biggest
problem with the mansion


893
00:44:26.973 --> 00:44:28.495
is keeping it heated
and maintained


894
00:44:28.496 --> 00:44:30.367
while it's not being used.

895
00:44:30.368 --> 00:44:33.152
Which is 99% of the time.

896
00:44:33.153 --> 00:44:34.849
And if we had a ball
there every night,


897
00:44:34.850 --> 00:44:36.242
well, then we'd
lose the very rarity


898
00:44:36.243 --> 00:44:38.636
that makes it so special.

899
00:44:38.637 --> 00:44:40.594
The town's been
helping the cassidys


900
00:44:40.595 --> 00:44:43.815
with the costs for a long
time, but it's a big number.


901
00:44:43.816 --> 00:44:46.296
Maybe it doesn't
have to be a ball.


902
00:44:47.733 --> 00:44:50.343
What about a farmers market?

903
00:44:50.344 --> 00:44:52.127
Or a wedding venue.

904
00:44:52.128 --> 00:44:53.172
It's so beautiful.

905
00:44:53.173 --> 00:44:55.304
Why not both?

906
00:44:55.305 --> 00:44:57.829
Well, people have been asking

907
00:44:57.830 --> 00:45:01.223
for an indoor farmers
market for years.


908
00:45:01.224 --> 00:45:03.356
We could use the barn.

909
00:45:03.357 --> 00:45:05.271
And the house and the
grounds are magazine worthy.


910
00:45:05.272 --> 00:45:06.925
We'd just need a marketing
campaign to get the word out.


911
00:45:06.926 --> 00:45:08.623
Oh! They're perfect.

912
00:45:10.712 --> 00:45:12.844
But who'd run it.

913
00:45:12.845 --> 00:45:14.149
I happen to know a
certain empty nester


914
00:45:14.150 --> 00:45:15.350
who's been needing a new baby.

915
00:45:16.501 --> 00:45:18.023
Am I so obvious?

916
00:45:19.939 --> 00:45:21.723
Look, a shooting star!

917
00:45:23.682 --> 00:45:26.335
I wish that you and
Sean save the mansion.


918
00:45:26.336 --> 00:45:28.555
I wish the universe
would give me a sign.


919
00:45:28.556 --> 00:45:29.948
If Sean's the one
I meant to be with,


920
00:45:29.949 --> 00:45:32.037
have him call me right now.

921
00:45:37.913 --> 00:45:39.784
You're not gonna get that?

922
00:45:39.785 --> 00:45:42.395
It's a telemarketer.

923
00:45:42.396 --> 00:45:44.571
Just because
you don't get a sign


924
00:45:44.572 --> 00:45:47.879
doesn't mean it's
not gonna work out.


925
00:46:05.724 --> 00:46:06.724
Hey, hon.

926
00:46:08.640 --> 00:46:11.816
I saw your track of the
old fogeys home today.


927
00:46:11.817 --> 00:46:12.991
Visiting grandpa?

928
00:46:15.037 --> 00:46:16.037
Sean?

929
00:47:02.955 --> 00:47:04.172
Hello?

930
00:47:04.173 --> 00:47:05.870
Daddy, we have a problem.

931
00:47:05.871 --> 00:47:07.524
Heather, what now?

932
00:47:07.525 --> 00:47:09.482
He's finding evidence.

933
00:47:09.483 --> 00:47:10.658
Good evidence.

934
00:47:12.312 --> 00:47:13.791
I think maybe
someone's helping him.


935
00:47:13.792 --> 00:47:15.444
Heather, do
you want to be appointed


936
00:47:15.445 --> 00:47:18.883
executive developer
of this mall or not?


937
00:47:18.884 --> 00:47:19.884
Wh-

938
00:47:20.407 --> 00:47:22.147
yes!

939
00:47:22.148 --> 00:47:24.192
I want him with
anything in this world.


940
00:47:24.193 --> 00:47:25.846
Then start making
some executive decisions.


941
00:47:25.847 --> 00:47:28.501
You know this man, you
know how to shake him up.


942
00:47:28.502 --> 00:47:30.372
Change his mind!

943
00:47:30.373 --> 00:47:32.201
Am I making myself clear?

944
00:47:35.335 --> 00:47:36.335
Crystal.

945
00:48:23.209 --> 00:48:24.383
Morning!

946
00:48:24.384 --> 00:48:26.124
Good morning.

947
00:48:26.125 --> 00:48:28.822
Dressing up for someone?

948
00:48:28.823 --> 00:48:33.522
Please tell me that
manicure is for your keyboard.


949
00:48:33.523 --> 00:48:34.437
There's point in
trying to figure out


950
00:48:34.438 --> 00:48:36.482
the ending to my novel

951
00:48:36.483 --> 00:48:38.092
without first finding out
how my love story ends.


952
00:48:38.093 --> 00:48:39.703
I think it's great

953
00:48:39.704 --> 00:48:41.400
that you want to reflect
your life experiences


954
00:48:41.401 --> 00:48:43.271
in your writing,

955
00:48:43.272 --> 00:48:46.144
but don't forget that
relationships take work.


956
00:48:46.145 --> 00:48:48.407
Writing takes work.

957
00:48:48.408 --> 00:48:51.540
Relationships only
take one thing: Love.


958
00:48:51.541 --> 00:48:54.282
Fate brings people together,

959
00:48:54.283 --> 00:48:57.982
and if it's meant to
be, it should be easy.


960
00:48:57.983 --> 00:49:00.201
I don't know if your father
would have agreed with that.


961
00:49:00.202 --> 00:49:02.422
Well, let's see if Sean does.

962
00:49:14.216 --> 00:49:15.564
Okay.

963
00:49:15.565 --> 00:49:17.785
Time to rip off the band-aid.

964
00:49:20.570 --> 00:49:22.659
Miss pick here
and let me just cut to the chase,


965
00:49:22.660 --> 00:49:24.791
I can't won't call you back

966
00:49:24.792 --> 00:49:27.359
if you don't leave your
name and number, so do it!


967
00:49:28.275 --> 00:49:29.362
Hi, miss pick.

968
00:49:30.450 --> 00:49:31.929
I mean Heather.

969
00:49:31.930 --> 00:49:32.973
It's Sean.

970
00:49:32.974 --> 00:49:34.323
My number is 555...

971
00:49:37.196 --> 00:49:38.980
Listen, we need to talk.

972
00:49:40.416 --> 00:49:41.416
Today.

973
00:49:43.419 --> 00:49:45.856
I feel like things have
been a little off recently,


974
00:49:45.857 --> 00:49:48.206
and if you could

00:49:49.904 --> 00:49:51.035

00:50:17.236 --> 00:50:18.976
Whatever do you mean?

987
00:50:18.977 --> 00:50:20.629
Please.

988
00:50:20.630 --> 00:50:22.196
I'd recognize our
song three miles away.


989
00:50:22.197 --> 00:50:24.764
What took you so long?

990
00:50:24.765 --> 00:50:27.811
There was something I
needed to take care of first.


991
00:50:27.812 --> 00:50:30.509
So I could give
you my full attention.


992
00:50:30.510 --> 00:50:33.512
And did you manage
to take care of it?


993
00:50:33.513 --> 00:50:35.166
Not quite.

994
00:50:35.167 --> 00:50:37.168
But I'm resolute.

995
00:50:37.169 --> 00:50:39.126
What's this?

996
00:50:39.127 --> 00:50:41.912
This is the finished proposal

997
00:50:41.913 --> 00:50:44.653
and an idea for a farmers
market and a wedding venue


998
00:50:44.654 --> 00:50:46.874
overseen by my sweet mother.

There's something I've
been meaning to tell you.


1004
00:51:06.807 --> 00:51:08.547

This.

1010
00:51:25.086 --> 00:51:26.521
Help me!

1011
00:51:26.522 --> 00:51:27.915
I've been maimed!

1012
00:51:32.224 --> 00:51:33.094
What happened?

1013
00:51:33.095 --> 00:51:34.703
Are you okay?

1014
00:51:34.704 --> 00:51:36.967
No, I'm not okay!
I'm seriously wounded!


1015
00:51:36.968 --> 00:51:40.535
I'm just lucky it was
my leg and not my neck!


1016
00:51:40.536 --> 00:51:41.710
You fell?

1017
00:51:41.711 --> 00:51:43.974
Yeah.

1018
00:51:43.975 --> 00:51:44.758
I got your voicemail, and I
was hurrying into the mansion


1019
00:51:44.759 --> 00:51:46.628
when this happened.

1020
00:51:46.629 --> 00:51:48.457
Step broke right through!

1021
00:51:50.155 --> 00:51:51.633
Just imagine the lawsuit

1022
00:51:51.634 --> 00:51:55.246
if it weren't someone
as spry as myself.


1023
00:51:55.247 --> 00:51:57.640
This whole place
is a death trap.


1024
00:51:59.425 --> 00:52:01.295
The whole structure's
just rotting away.


1025
00:52:01.296 --> 00:52:02.644
I don't know about
the whole structure.


1026
00:52:02.645 --> 00:52:04.472
It was just one step.

1027
00:52:04.473 --> 00:52:06.561
Give me your keys.

1028
00:52:06.562 --> 00:52:07.562
I'll get the truck, and we
can take her to the hospital


1029
00:52:07.563 --> 00:52:08.303
and make sure nothing's broken.

1030
00:52:08.304 --> 00:52:09.956
Oh!

1031
00:52:09.957 --> 00:52:11.566
Oh, I can't put
any weight on it!


1032
00:52:11.567 --> 00:52:13.481
I can't put any weight on it.

1033
00:52:13.482 --> 00:52:17.008
If it's not broken, it's
definitely fractured.


1034
00:52:23.318 --> 00:52:25.146
I'm so lucky to have you.

1035
00:52:26.800 --> 00:52:28.366
I'm probably gonna
be out of commission


1036
00:52:28.367 --> 00:52:31.195
for the rest of the summer.

1037
00:52:31.196 --> 00:52:32.501
I'm gonna need you.

1038
00:52:34.634 --> 00:52:38.115
Help me get dressed,
drive me to the stables...


1039
00:52:38.116 --> 00:52:39.420
Feed me.

1040
00:52:39.421 --> 00:52:41.423
Are your arms broken too?

1041
00:52:43.556 --> 00:52:46.514
I was just saying
how lucky it is


1042
00:52:46.515 --> 00:52:50.431
and fortunate that I have
someone who loves me,


1043
00:52:50.432 --> 00:52:54.175
someone who would choose
me over some old building.


1044
00:52:58.310 --> 00:53:00.703
So what was your
voicemail about?


1045
00:53:02.009 --> 00:53:04.533
Nothing. Don't worry about it.

1046
00:53:07.841 --> 00:53:09.624
Okay, do you want...

1047
00:53:12.890 --> 00:53:14.716
Do you need help?

1048
00:53:14.717 --> 00:53:16.327
We should get something
to stabilize her leg.


1049
00:53:16.328 --> 00:53:17.719
Oh, don't worry
about it, grace.


1050
00:53:17.720 --> 00:53:20.419
My seanie will stabilize
it while you drive.


1051
00:53:21.811 --> 00:53:23.943
My seanie?

1052
00:53:23.944 --> 00:53:27.295
Maybe she hit her head
too. We'd better get going!


1053
00:53:39.699 --> 00:53:40.873
I'll be right back
with a wheelchair.


1054
00:53:40.874 --> 00:53:42.483
Don't talk to each other!

1055
00:53:42.484 --> 00:53:44.486
What?

1056
00:53:47.315 --> 00:53:49.403
He really is sweet, isn't he?

1057
00:53:49.404 --> 00:53:51.579
He really is.

1058
00:53:51.580 --> 00:53:53.755
This town's lucky to have him.

1059
00:53:53.756 --> 00:53:55.279
Good cheekbones.

1060
00:53:55.280 --> 00:53:56.585
Contagious laugh.

1061
00:53:58.805 --> 00:54:00.545
You really did capture him
in your novels, you know?


1062
00:54:00.546 --> 00:54:03.504
All his happy-go-lucky
mannerisms.


1063
00:54:03.505 --> 00:54:05.767
I'm so glad you could tell.

1064
00:54:05.768 --> 00:54:08.945
It was really hard to
capture his character, his...


1065
00:54:08.946 --> 00:54:09.946
Essence.

1066
00:54:11.078 --> 00:54:12.861
I don't know how you do it.

1067
00:54:12.862 --> 00:54:14.385
Do what?

1068
00:54:14.386 --> 00:54:16.561
You know.

1069
00:54:16.562 --> 00:54:19.477
Recall those feelings every
time you sit down to write.


1070
00:54:19.478 --> 00:54:20.652
It sounds exhausting.

1071
00:54:21.784 --> 00:54:22.742
Everyone doing okay in here?

1072
00:54:22.743 --> 00:54:24.003
Sean!

1073
00:54:24.004 --> 00:54:26.832
I was in a rush, I'm sorry!

1074
00:54:26.833 --> 00:54:27.616
Are you okay?

1075
00:54:27.617 --> 00:54:29.530
Yeah.

1076
00:54:29.531 --> 00:54:30.010
Watch your leg, watch
your leg, watch you leg.


1077
00:54:30.010 --> 00:54:30.924
Okay, sit, sit.

1078
00:54:30.924 --> 00:54:31.924
- Ow!
- Ooh!


1079
00:54:32.665 --> 00:54:33.665
I'm so sorry.

1080
00:54:39.628 --> 00:54:41.238
Grace.

1081
00:54:41.239 --> 00:54:42.239
James!

1082
00:54:42.936 --> 00:54:44.763
What are you doing here?

1083
00:54:44.764 --> 00:54:46.895
I applied for the
locum position here.


1084
00:54:46.896 --> 00:54:48.767
They offered me the job.

1085
00:54:48.768 --> 00:54:50.682
I don't know if
I should take it.


1086
00:54:50.683 --> 00:54:53.250
After looking around,
this town just seems so...


1087
00:54:53.251 --> 00:54:54.251
Quiet.

1088
00:54:55.340 --> 00:54:56.297
You don't live here, do you?

1089
00:54:56.298 --> 00:54:57.298
No, no, I...

1090
00:54:58.908 --> 00:55:00.188
I mean, I did.
I'm just visiting.


1091
00:55:01.433 --> 00:55:02.737
Grace was born
and raised here.


1092
00:55:02.738 --> 00:55:04.739
She's ours.

1093
00:55:04.740 --> 00:55:08.396
I mean, she knows how
to appreciate the quiet.


1094
00:55:09.745 --> 00:55:11.834
How do you guys know each other?

1095
00:55:13.445 --> 00:55:15.576
I sense tension.

1096
00:55:15.577 --> 00:55:20.059
Is this an la boyfriend
you've been keeping from us?


1097
00:55:20.060 --> 00:55:21.930
James bought one of my books.

1098
00:55:21.931 --> 00:55:25.412
It's hard to resist
a given saleswoman.


1099
00:55:25.413 --> 00:55:26.892
I know we could all stay here

1100
00:55:26.893 --> 00:55:28.459
gushing over
grace's books all day,


1101
00:55:28.460 --> 00:55:30.896
but I need to see
a doctor, Sean.


1102
00:55:30.897 --> 00:55:31.897
Right.

1103
00:55:33.378 --> 00:55:35.074
Grace, you coming?

1104
00:55:35.075 --> 00:55:37.729
I'll just wait in the truck.

1105
00:55:38.774 --> 00:55:40.645
It's the locks.

1106
00:55:43.562 --> 00:55:45.867
It'll be a bit of
a wait for them,


1107
00:55:45.868 --> 00:55:48.087
and I'm just getting off work.

1108
00:55:48.088 --> 00:55:51.917
If you don't mind, I'll drop
you anywhere you need to go.


1109
00:55:51.918 --> 00:55:52.961
Okay.

1110
00:55:52.962 --> 00:55:54.050
Sure.

1111
00:55:54.051 --> 00:55:55.051
Wonderful.

1112
00:55:55.052 --> 00:55:56.009
I'll be back in five.

1113
00:55:56.010 --> 00:55:57.228
Sounds good.

1114
00:56:14.549 --> 00:56:15.549
Hi, mom.

1115
00:56:16.899 --> 00:56:19.205
Oh, not so fast young lady!

1116
00:56:19.206 --> 00:56:20.424
I need to get
inside and write.


1117
00:56:20.425 --> 00:56:21.642
I know how my novel ends.

1118
00:56:21.643 --> 00:56:22.948
So what does that mean?

1119
00:56:22.949 --> 00:56:24.906
Sean's the only one for me.

1120
00:56:24.907 --> 00:56:27.561
No one, no matter how
dreamy, can take his place.


1121
00:56:27.562 --> 00:56:28.780
We're soulmates.

1122
00:56:28.781 --> 00:56:30.521
That's amazing, sweetie.

1123
00:56:30.522 --> 00:56:32.218
I'm glad you're
proving me wrong.


1124
00:56:32.219 --> 00:56:35.091
Not to mention he's
driving quite the car now.


1125
00:56:35.092 --> 00:56:37.789
Oh, that was
actually a friend from la.


1126
00:56:37.790 --> 00:56:39.486
Your two worlds colliding?

1127
00:56:39.487 --> 00:56:41.271
More like a surprise meteor.

1128
00:56:41.272 --> 00:56:43.403
Isn't that what wiped
out the dinosaurs?


1129
00:56:45.319 --> 00:56:48.408
Go finish your book while
you're glowing with inspiration.


1130
00:57:04.599 --> 00:57:05.599
Thank you.

1131
00:57:31.017 --> 00:57:35.629
I just swear it was the
other leg you were clutching.


1132
00:57:35.630 --> 00:57:38.154
It's weird that the
one that hurt less...


1133
00:57:38.155 --> 00:57:40.199
Was the one that was fractured.

1134
00:57:40.200 --> 00:57:42.897
Yeah, well, you're an
architect, not a physician.


1135
00:57:42.898 --> 00:57:45.074
Let's just stay in your field.

1136
00:57:46.511 --> 00:57:48.599
Can I get you anything?

1137
00:57:48.600 --> 00:57:49.600
Water? Tea?

1138
00:57:54.083 --> 00:57:57.869
How about the permit to
that old house's demolition?


1139
00:57:57.870 --> 00:58:01.830
As long as it's still standing,
people are in danger.


1140
00:58:04.050 --> 00:58:06.182
I know you were planning
on being a lead investor


1141
00:58:06.183 --> 00:58:08.707
and developer
in the outlet mall.


1142
00:58:10.404 --> 00:58:12.971
This has nothing
to do with that.


1143
00:58:12.972 --> 00:58:14.060
Are you sure?

1144
00:58:20.284 --> 00:58:21.980
How'd you know?

1145
00:58:21.981 --> 00:58:24.330
You leave your
sticky notes everywhere.


1146
00:58:24.331 --> 00:58:26.332
It wasn't that hard
to piece together.


1147
00:58:26.333 --> 00:58:28.595
That house is gonna
come down, Sean.


1148
00:58:28.596 --> 00:58:30.771
It's just a matter of time.

1149
00:58:30.772 --> 00:58:32.120
And the land is better
off in the hands of a local


1150
00:58:32.121 --> 00:58:33.948
than some outside builder.

1151
00:58:33.949 --> 00:58:36.124
Have you ever considered

1152
00:58:36.125 --> 00:58:38.475
there might be a better
use for your money,


1153
00:58:38.476 --> 00:58:41.347
something that makes
it more positive change?


1154
00:58:41.348 --> 00:58:43.044
I am not paying for
you to go on another


1155
00:58:43.045 --> 00:58:45.917
six-month archeological dig.

1156
00:58:45.918 --> 00:58:48.311
It was a six-day
architectural convention,


1157
00:58:48.312 --> 00:58:50.356
and I paid you back.

1158
00:58:50.357 --> 00:58:54.273
Old buildings, old
bones, all the same to me.


1159
00:58:54.274 --> 00:58:56.668
Now I'll take that tea, please.

1160
00:59:46.195 --> 00:59:47.239
That everything?

1161
00:59:47.240 --> 00:59:49.067
For now.

1162
00:59:49.068 --> 00:59:50.721
Store everything
near the kitchen.


1163
00:59:50.722 --> 00:59:52.244
The decorating
crew will be in tonight.


1164
00:59:52.245 --> 00:59:53.941
I can't believe
that ball's tomorrow.


1165
00:59:53.942 --> 00:59:55.247
This week flew by.

1166
00:59:55.248 --> 00:59:57.118
Life does that.

1167
00:59:57.119 --> 00:59:59.948
And the older you
get, the faster it goes.


1168
01:00:02.211 --> 01:00:03.778
Call you in a bit.

1169
01:00:07.347 --> 01:00:09.654
No mansion means no dancin'!

1170
01:00:11.003 --> 01:00:13.048
No mansion means no dancin'!

1171
01:00:14.789 --> 01:00:16.791
No mansion means no dancin'!

1172
01:00:17.966 --> 01:00:19.141
Grandpa Albert?

1173
01:00:20.926 --> 01:00:22.143
What are you
doing here so early?


1174
01:00:22.144 --> 01:00:23.231
You must be freezing.

1175
01:00:24.364 --> 01:00:26.800
I'm hot with a raging fire!

1176
01:00:26.801 --> 01:00:28.194
Sweating for justice!

1177
01:00:30.065 --> 01:00:31.665
Does the nursing
home know you're here?


1178
01:00:32.241 --> 01:00:34.939
Do those people know anything?

1179
01:00:34.940 --> 01:00:38.377
The newspaper said
that a step came loose


1180
01:00:38.378 --> 01:00:41.859
and some local lady got injured.

1181
01:00:41.860 --> 01:00:44.471
They said the
mansion was a hazard.


1182
01:00:50.390 --> 01:00:51.477
That doesn't necessarily mean

1183
01:00:51.478 --> 01:00:53.131
the building will be demolished.

1184
01:00:53.132 --> 01:00:56.352
We get the final
word this afternoon.


1185
01:00:56.353 --> 01:00:59.660
Those bureau-rats
should know the facts!


1186
01:01:06.624 --> 01:01:10.062
Sean, I need you to
get to the mansion now!


1187
01:01:12.194 --> 01:01:14.892
What facts, grandpa
Albert, are we talking about?


1188
01:01:14.893 --> 01:01:18.156
I proposed to
Marjorie on those steps.


1189
01:01:18.157 --> 01:01:21.115
They're as sturdy
as our marriage.


1190
01:01:21.116 --> 01:01:25.337
What we're dealing with
here is first degree sabotage.


1191
01:01:25.338 --> 01:01:27.078
Joe, come here!

1192
01:01:27.079 --> 01:01:28.079
Hey, Joe!

1193
01:01:29.081 --> 01:01:30.081
Wait here.

1194
01:01:33.085 --> 01:01:35.303
Hey! What are you doing?

1195
01:01:35.304 --> 01:01:36.914
Marking the placements.

1196
01:01:36.915 --> 01:01:38.568
For the explosives?

1197
01:01:38.569 --> 01:01:40.396
They need to be aligned
with the support beam


1198
01:01:40.397 --> 01:01:41.962
to ensure the entire building
comes down in one go.


1199
01:01:41.963 --> 01:01:43.834
You can't implode the mansion!

1200
01:01:43.835 --> 01:01:45.357
No final decision's
been announced!


1201
01:01:45.358 --> 01:01:47.403
We're just doing some
preliminary work, okay?


1202
01:01:47.404 --> 01:01:49.405
We won't do anything
actually until the results are in.


1203
01:01:49.406 --> 01:01:50.928
So stop digging holes!

1204
01:01:50.929 --> 01:01:52.538
If I don't dig holes,

1205
01:01:52.539 --> 01:01:55.062
the wrecking ball
guy may take my job.


1206
01:01:55.063 --> 01:01:57.413
We're all fighting for
something here, sweetie.


1207
01:01:57.414 --> 01:02:00.416
No mansion means no dancin'!

1208
01:02:00.417 --> 01:02:02.113
You hit a gas line?

1209
01:02:02.114 --> 01:02:02.810
No dancin'

1210
01:02:02.810 --> 01:02:03.420
Albert!

1211
01:02:03.420 --> 01:02:04.420
No ma-

1212
01:02:08.468 --> 01:02:09.468
Marjorie!

1213
01:02:10.470 --> 01:02:12.733
Oh, I'm so glad you came back.

1214
01:02:15.214 --> 01:02:18.825
This is what happens when
problems get swept under the rug.


1215
01:02:18.826 --> 01:02:20.697
Couples fight.

1216
01:02:20.698 --> 01:02:21.350
Grace?

1217
01:02:21.351 --> 01:02:22.438
Sean!

1218
01:02:22.439 --> 01:02:24.222
Grandpa Albert?

1219
01:02:24.223 --> 01:02:25.484
Come again?

1220
01:02:25.485 --> 01:02:26.790
This isn't what it looks like.

1221
01:02:26.791 --> 01:02:29.967
I was professing my love.

1222
01:02:29.968 --> 01:02:33.100
All right, it's exactly
what it looks like.


1223
01:02:33.101 --> 01:02:34.667
Come on, grandpa.

1224
01:02:34.668 --> 01:02:36.495
We need to get you
back to the home.


1225
01:02:36.496 --> 01:02:39.106
This will be your 10th demerit.

1226
01:02:42.284 --> 01:02:45.853
Can I have one last
look inside the mansion?


1227
01:03:03.523 --> 01:03:06.482
Those contractors are
already planning her implosion.


1228
01:03:06.483 --> 01:03:09.136
That's how certain they
are that we already failed.


1229
01:03:09.137 --> 01:03:11.051
We put up the
best fight we could


1230
01:03:11.052 --> 01:03:14.751
for the people of this
community, living and passed.


1231
01:03:14.752 --> 01:03:18.450
That's what the
blue moon's all about.


1232
01:03:18.451 --> 01:03:20.670
Speaking of...

1233
01:03:20.671 --> 01:03:23.542
You haven't officially
asked me to the ball yet.


1234
01:03:23.543 --> 01:03:25.979
I think I asked you last time.

1235
01:03:25.980 --> 01:03:28.200
Doesn't that make it your turn.

1236
01:03:29.810 --> 01:03:30.811
Sean green...

1237
01:03:32.160 --> 01:03:34.641
Will you go to the ball with me?

1238
01:03:36.338 --> 01:03:37.858
I'll see if I can
fit in my schedule.


1239
01:03:38.906 --> 01:03:40.777
Great.

1240
01:03:40.778 --> 01:03:41.430
I'll come by yours
tomorrow and pick you up.


1241
01:03:41.431 --> 01:03:43.214
Um...

1242
01:03:43.215 --> 01:03:45.912
Maybe I should pick you up.

1243
01:03:45.913 --> 01:03:46.913
Sean?

1244
01:03:49.221 --> 01:03:50.221
Sean green?

1245
01:03:56.010 --> 01:03:57.010
Hi, Oscar.

1246
01:03:57.011 --> 01:03:59.143
Hey, good luck.

1247
01:03:59.144 --> 01:04:00.361
My daughter, she's been
looking forward to this ball


1248
01:04:00.362 --> 01:04:02.059
for five years straight.

1249
01:04:02.060 --> 01:04:03.277
It'll be her first one.

1250
01:04:03.278 --> 01:04:04.278
Let's hope.

1251
01:04:07.456 --> 01:04:10.371
Steps seem fine.

1252
01:04:24.561 --> 01:04:28.433
Well, what are you
waiting for? Open it.


1253
01:04:28.434 --> 01:04:30.696
What if we didn't get it?

1254
01:04:30.697 --> 01:04:32.437
I'd be chased out of town!

1255
01:04:32.438 --> 01:04:35.266
Sean, no one would blame you.

1256
01:04:35.267 --> 01:04:37.225
We did everything we could.

1257
01:04:39.184 --> 01:04:40.185
You open it.

1258
01:04:41.403 --> 01:04:43.187
If we got the permit,

1259
01:04:43.188 --> 01:04:46.408
it's all because of
you're amazing proposal.


1260
01:04:49.455 --> 01:04:50.455
Well?

1261
01:04:52.676 --> 01:04:54.068
I'm sorry, Sean.

1262
01:04:57.506 --> 01:05:00.204
Sorry that you ever
doubted yourself!


1263
01:05:00.205 --> 01:05:01.771
We got the permit,

1264
01:05:01.772 --> 01:05:02.511
and the town's gonna
buy out the cassidys.


1265
01:05:02.511 --> 01:05:03.338
We did it!

1266
01:05:03.339 --> 01:05:05.209
Yes!

1267
01:05:05.210 --> 01:05:06.732
I guess the blue
moon had our back.


1268
01:05:06.733 --> 01:05:08.212
This wasn't the
blue moon, grace.


1269
01:05:08.213 --> 01:05:09.256
This was all you!

1270
01:05:09.257 --> 01:05:10.431
We make a great team.

1271
01:05:10.432 --> 01:05:11.346
I'm gonna let grandpa know!

1272
01:05:11.347 --> 01:05:12.651
Okay.

1273
01:05:12.652 --> 01:05:14.392
I'm gonna let the newspaper know

1274
01:05:14.393 --> 01:05:15.741
that the ball is
full steam ahead,


1275
01:05:15.742 --> 01:05:16.482
and I'll be at
your place at six.


1276
01:05:16.483 --> 01:05:18.614
Six? Tonight?

1277
01:05:18.615 --> 01:05:23.141
I like sweet
shiraz and chardonnay.


1278
01:05:34.065 --> 01:05:35.065
Heather...

1279
01:05:36.284 --> 01:05:37.546
I want to break up.

1280
01:05:42.290 --> 01:05:44.118
We don't love each other.

1281
01:05:46.555 --> 01:05:48.949
I don't even think you like me.

1282
01:05:52.344 --> 01:05:54.085
Is there another woman?

1283
01:05:55.782 --> 01:05:58.132
Well, if we're being honest...

1284
01:05:59.873 --> 01:06:03.223
Heather, put down
the dinner plates!


1285
01:06:03.224 --> 01:06:07.228
No, no. Can't we talk about
this like civilized adults?


1286
01:06:08.447 --> 01:06:10.014
Get out of my house!

1287
01:06:12.277 --> 01:06:13.452
This is my house!

1288
01:06:29.163 --> 01:06:30.163
Heather?

1289
01:06:31.122 --> 01:06:32.122
You home?

1290
01:06:45.527 --> 01:06:47.355
I'm in here!

1291
01:06:50.315 --> 01:06:51.533
We need to talk.

1292
01:06:57.888 --> 01:06:59.976
Are those the permit
results for the mansion?


1293
01:06:59.977 --> 01:07:02.718
The results have nothing to
do with what I'm about to say.


1294
01:07:02.719 --> 01:07:05.242
Unless you're about
to say the results,


1295
01:07:05.243 --> 01:07:07.244
which I'd really like to know.

1296
01:07:07.245 --> 01:07:10.377
Heather, I want to break up.

1297
01:07:10.378 --> 01:07:12.292
We don't love each other.

1298
01:07:12.293 --> 01:07:13.293
If anything-

1299
01:07:13.294 --> 01:07:14.294
- okay.

1300
01:07:15.470 --> 01:07:16.775
Okay?

1301
01:07:16.776 --> 01:07:18.168
Yeah, fine. Let's break up.

1302
01:07:18.169 --> 01:07:20.431
Just like that?

1303
01:07:20.432 --> 01:07:23.695
I'm gonna need some
alone time to grieve.


1304
01:07:23.696 --> 01:07:24.696
Mind leaving?

1305
01:07:26.655 --> 01:07:28.919
Actually, this is my house.

1306
01:07:30.659 --> 01:07:33.270
Both my leg and my
heart have been broken


1307
01:07:33.271 --> 01:07:35.141
in the past 24 hours,
and you have the gall-


1308
01:07:35.142 --> 01:07:36.142
- okay.

1309
01:07:37.057 --> 01:07:38.405
Sorry, you're right.

1310
01:07:38.406 --> 01:07:40.451
Take all the time you need.

1311
01:07:40.452 --> 01:07:41.452
Sorry.

1312
01:07:55.336 --> 01:07:57.555
I thought your leg was broken.

1313
01:07:57.556 --> 01:07:58.556
Ow, ow, ow!

1314
01:08:01.690 --> 01:08:02.821
It's the other one.

1315
01:08:08.219 --> 01:08:09.610
I'd loved to have
seen Heather's face


1316
01:08:09.611 --> 01:08:11.438
when she heard the news.

1317
01:08:11.439 --> 01:08:13.789
I don't know what you
have against that girl.


1318
01:08:13.790 --> 01:08:17.096
She spent her whole life
wanting to be just like you.


1319
01:08:17.097 --> 01:08:19.011
Very funny.

1320
01:08:19.012 --> 01:08:21.405
I'm the last person that
Heather would ever want to be.


1321
01:08:21.406 --> 01:08:23.450
I'm proud of our family,
but compared to her,


1322
01:08:23.451 --> 01:08:25.539
I grew up with nothing.

1323
01:08:25.540 --> 01:08:29.021
That may be true, but just to
imagine how she sees things.


1324
01:08:29.022 --> 01:08:32.068
You grew up earning
everything that she got for free.


1325
01:08:32.069 --> 01:08:35.375
And you're the one with
the career and passion.


1326
01:08:35.376 --> 01:08:39.597
She may have money, but her
dreams haven't come to fruition.


1327
01:08:39.598 --> 01:08:42.427
If she even knows
what her dreams are.


1328
01:08:44.255 --> 01:08:46.517
I never thought
of it that way.


1329
01:08:46.518 --> 01:08:49.825
Do you think-

1330
01:08:49.826 --> 01:08:51.305
Hold that thought.

1331
01:08:56.093 --> 01:08:57.136
Hello?

1332
01:08:57.137 --> 01:08:59.008
Grace, finally!

1333
01:08:59.009 --> 01:09:00.836
Either you're in some
backwards hole in the wall


1334
01:09:00.837 --> 01:09:02.533
with no WiFi, or you
have developed a tendency


1335
01:09:02.534 --> 01:09:04.143
to hang up on me.

1336
01:09:04.144 --> 01:09:05.753
I would never.

1337
01:09:05.754 --> 01:09:06.754
Did you get a chance
to read my novel?


1338
01:09:06.755 --> 01:09:08.800
What did you think?

1339
01:09:08.801 --> 01:09:10.280
I think we should
discuss this in my office.


1340
01:09:10.281 --> 01:09:12.282
Can you come in
tomorrow morning?


1341
01:09:12.283 --> 01:09:13.283
Tomorrow?

1342
01:09:14.589 --> 01:09:16.068
Is it urgent?

1343
01:09:16.069 --> 01:09:17.591
It certainly shouldn't
be postponed.


1344
01:09:17.592 --> 01:09:18.766
Is that a problem.

1345
01:09:18.767 --> 01:09:20.986
No, no. No problem at all.

1346
01:09:20.987 --> 01:09:23.423
I'll book a flight
back to la tonight.


1347
01:09:23.424 --> 01:09:24.729
Great.

1348
01:09:24.730 --> 01:09:25.817
Okay, kiddo, I'll see you soon.

1349
01:09:25.818 --> 01:09:26.818
See ya.

1350
01:09:35.262 --> 01:09:36.741
Sean.

1351
01:09:44.663 --> 01:09:49.189
I've faked a lot of things
these past few months, but...


1352
01:09:50.843 --> 01:09:52.323
I never faked how
badly I wanted this.


1353
01:09:55.152 --> 01:09:58.197
It would have been a chance
to make something of myself.


1354
01:09:58.198 --> 01:09:59.286
You're a pick.

1355
01:10:00.592 --> 01:10:03.637
You're the top of the town.

1356
01:10:03.638 --> 01:10:05.901
You never had to prove yourself.

1357
01:10:05.902 --> 01:10:09.688
Maybe not to you, but
to myself and to my family?


1358
01:10:14.649 --> 01:10:18.044
I can't just live off
daddy's charity forever.


1359
01:10:20.090 --> 01:10:24.572
Anyway, that's enough that
rich girl's sob story for today.


1360
01:10:26.966 --> 01:10:30.360
Thank you for not freaking out.

1361
01:10:30.361 --> 01:10:31.753
How could I be mad?

1362
01:10:35.061 --> 01:10:36.453
I've made my fair
share of mistakes


1363
01:10:36.454 --> 01:10:38.282
in this relationship too.

1364
01:11:15.754 --> 01:11:17.364
It's open.

1365
01:11:18.975 --> 01:11:20.279
What's going on?

1366
01:11:20.280 --> 01:11:21.889
Oh, you know.

1367
01:11:21.890 --> 01:11:23.935
Just realizing I'm
living in a fantasy.


1368
01:11:23.936 --> 01:11:26.111
Truth is so much
crueler than fiction.


1369
01:11:26.112 --> 01:11:27.852
I don't think that's
how the saying goes.


1370
01:11:27.853 --> 01:11:29.636
Are you leaving?

1371
01:11:29.637 --> 01:11:31.769
My publisher told
me to come back to la


1372
01:11:31.770 --> 01:11:33.466
'cause my novel
was a total flop.


1373
01:11:33.467 --> 01:11:34.467
He said that?

1374
01:11:34.468 --> 01:11:35.991
He didn't have to.

1375
01:11:35.992 --> 01:11:37.775
But the blue moon
ball is tomorrow night.


1376
01:11:37.776 --> 01:11:39.646
Trust me, I know.

1377
01:11:39.647 --> 01:11:41.518
I'm just scared
that you're going back


1378
01:11:41.519 --> 01:11:43.085
with more mixed
emotions about this place


1379
01:11:43.086 --> 01:11:45.957
than when you came here.

1380
01:11:45.958 --> 01:11:49.265
I'm focused on my
career, not my emotions.


1381
01:11:49.266 --> 01:11:52.920
You are gonna have the most
amazing writing career, grace!


1382
01:11:52.921 --> 01:11:54.574
I just worry you're
gonna have regrets


1383
01:11:54.575 --> 01:11:56.576
in other aspects of your life.

1384
01:11:56.577 --> 01:11:58.448
Like my
non-existent love life?


1385
01:11:58.449 --> 01:11:59.580
I don't think so.

1386
01:12:00.929 --> 01:12:01.929
Here.

1387
01:12:04.585 --> 01:12:06.848
I don't need any
more reminders of him!


1388
01:12:10.417 --> 01:12:11.417
Delete.

1389
01:12:26.955 --> 01:12:31.872

Hey!

1397
01:13:07.518 --> 01:13:08.822
No demolition!

1398
01:13:13.524 --> 01:13:14.785
No demolition.

1399
01:13:14.786 --> 01:13:16.918
Just some much-needed repairs.

1400
01:13:27.015 --> 01:13:28.842
Have a safe flight,
and remember to call


1401
01:13:28.843 --> 01:13:30.627
and let me know what they say.

1402
01:13:30.628 --> 01:13:33.760
And remember, grace, you
always have a home here.


1403
01:13:33.761 --> 01:13:36.938
I'll call you when I
get back to la, okay?


1404
01:13:39.854 --> 01:13:42.292
I love you, grace. Stay safe.

1405
01:13:43.467 --> 01:13:44.946
I love you too, mom.

1406
01:14:17.109 --> 01:14:18.588
I saw a car!

1407
01:14:18.589 --> 01:14:19.632
Was she in it?

1408
01:14:19.633 --> 01:14:21.112
You just missed her.

1409
01:14:21.113 --> 01:14:22.766
She's leaving?

1410
01:14:22.767 --> 01:14:24.898
Because of me?

1411
01:14:24.899 --> 01:14:27.858
You've gone ahead and
broken Gracie's heart again.


1412
01:14:27.859 --> 01:14:30.861
I'd be shocked if she ever
wants to come back home.


1413
01:14:30.862 --> 01:14:33.211
I broke up with Heather.

1414
01:14:33.212 --> 01:14:35.823
A few minutes
too late, it seems.


1415
01:14:39.784 --> 01:14:41.828
Grace kept the pillow?

1416
01:14:41.829 --> 01:14:43.743
She's always clung
onto a piece of your, Sean.


1417
01:14:43.744 --> 01:14:46.616
I'm sure she'd love to
have all of you for once.


1418
01:14:46.617 --> 01:14:49.401
I can't believe I lost
my chance with her.


1419
01:14:49.402 --> 01:14:53.013
Love has nothing to
do with chances, Sean.


1420
01:14:53.014 --> 01:14:55.495
Aw, Sean, you have a good night.

1421
01:15:34.969 --> 01:15:36.101
My cinderella.

1422
01:15:42.977 --> 01:15:46.110
Oh, Sean, I
feel badly for you,


1423
01:15:46.111 --> 01:15:48.155
but I don't think my
daughter would appreciate me


1424
01:15:48.156 --> 01:15:51.115
comforting you on the
night of her breakup.


1425
01:15:51.116 --> 01:15:55.424
What if this doesn't have to
be the night of her breakup?


1426
01:15:55.425 --> 01:15:59.994
What if this could be the first
day of her cinderella story?


1427
01:16:02.258 --> 01:16:04.389
I have the best idea.

1428
01:16:04.390 --> 01:16:07.087
I know this will. Please,
I know this will work.


1429
01:16:11.092 --> 01:16:13.790
Grace, it's my job
to be honest with you,


1430
01:16:13.791 --> 01:16:16.096
so that's what I'm gonna be.

1431
01:16:16.097 --> 01:16:19.186
A good romance novel,
heck, a good relationship


1432
01:16:19.187 --> 01:16:21.363
has lovers that beat the odds,

1433
01:16:21.364 --> 01:16:24.235
characters who confront
their biggest fears


1434
01:16:24.236 --> 01:16:26.368
and come out on the
other side stronger.


1435
01:16:26.369 --> 01:16:28.935
Lyndon and Savannah's
problems disappearing


1436
01:16:28.936 --> 01:16:31.068
under the blue moon is...

1437
01:16:31.069 --> 01:16:32.809
It's ex machina.

1438
01:16:32.810 --> 01:16:34.376
Do you think it's possible

1439
01:16:34.377 --> 01:16:36.160
that maybe you're
interpreting it wrong?


1440
01:16:36.161 --> 01:16:37.640
What you're reading
as ex machina


1441
01:16:37.641 --> 01:16:39.642
is meant to be read as fate.

1442
01:16:39.643 --> 01:16:41.165
True love conquers all.

1443
01:16:41.166 --> 01:16:42.775
What exactly did they conquer?

1444
01:16:42.776 --> 01:16:44.342
The distance that
held them apart.


1445
01:16:44.343 --> 01:16:46.301
Yes, right, so
they move closer


1446
01:16:46.302 --> 01:16:48.912
and they're no longer
physically distant.


1447
01:16:48.913 --> 01:16:51.828
What about the
emotional distance?


1448
01:16:51.829 --> 01:16:55.310
What about lyndon never
replying to her letters?


1449
01:16:55.311 --> 01:16:58.182
What about Savannah's
fear of commitment?


1450
01:16:58.183 --> 01:16:59.836
I can add those pages in.

1451
01:16:59.837 --> 01:17:01.621
Consider it an epilogue.

1452
01:17:05.103 --> 01:17:08.627
I'm gonna think
of it as a total bust.


1453
01:17:08.628 --> 01:17:09.846
What's this?

1454
01:17:09.847 --> 01:17:12.631
Your severance check.

1455
01:17:12.632 --> 01:17:13.807
Good luck, grace.

1456
01:17:15.983 --> 01:17:17.288
But it's a trilogy. What
about the third book?


1457
01:17:17.289 --> 01:17:20.073
Grace, you know,
sometimes an open ending


1458
01:17:20.074 --> 01:17:22.902
is more satisfactory
than the wrong ending.


1459
01:17:22.903 --> 01:17:23.903
Um...

1460
01:17:24.775 --> 01:17:26.950
Right. Yeah.

1461
01:17:26.951 --> 01:17:31.258
You know, one day you may
wake up to that happy ending,


1462
01:17:31.259 --> 01:17:33.783
but until then, maybe
you should stick


1463
01:17:33.784 --> 01:17:36.787
with user manuals
and technical writing.


1464
01:17:38.266 --> 01:17:39.789
Um...

1465
01:17:39.790 --> 01:17:41.356
Fyi, Danny...

1466
01:17:41.357 --> 01:17:42.705
Happy endings don't exist.

1467
01:17:45.230 --> 01:17:49.277
I think my ex-wife would
agree with you on that one.


1468
01:17:54.021 --> 01:17:56.240
I've only spent
one day in pediatrics,


1469
01:17:56.241 --> 01:17:59.156
but I am certain that's
where I'm supposed to be.


1470
01:17:59.157 --> 01:18:00.723
Now, there's something
about working with children


1471
01:18:00.724 --> 01:18:02.115
that makes me feel like

1472
01:18:02.116 --> 01:18:04.770
I'm making a
difference in the world.


1473
01:18:04.771 --> 01:18:06.643
That sounds so amazing.

1474
01:18:09.820 --> 01:18:10.820
I'm sorry.

1475
01:18:12.388 --> 01:18:13.779
I've been going on
and on about myself.


1476
01:18:13.780 --> 01:18:16.129
What's it like being a writer?

1477
01:18:16.130 --> 01:18:17.130
It's...

1478
01:18:19.090 --> 01:18:21.961
Challenging.

1479
01:18:21.962 --> 01:18:24.094
Sometimes I wish I could just...

1480
01:18:24.095 --> 01:18:25.923
Disappear into my books.

1481
01:18:27.620 --> 01:18:29.969
Can you tell that
from my writing?


1482
01:18:29.970 --> 01:18:32.885
I haven't actually had a
chance to read your book yet.


1483
01:18:34.888 --> 01:18:36.411
That's okay.

1484
01:18:36.412 --> 01:18:39.326
It's probably for the best.

1485
01:18:39.327 --> 01:18:40.458
Wait, wait, wait.

1486
01:18:40.459 --> 01:18:41.764
Hey, did I say something wrong?

1487
01:18:41.765 --> 01:18:43.157
No, it's not that.

1488
01:18:44.768 --> 01:18:47.247
You're perfect, James.

1489
01:18:47.248 --> 01:18:49.902
You're the kind of
guy I write books about.


1490
01:18:49.903 --> 01:18:52.122
But that's fiction.

1491
01:18:52.123 --> 01:18:53.123
Exactly.

1492
01:18:55.866 --> 01:18:57.301
I'll see you around.

1493
01:18:57.302 --> 01:19:00.696

I said go away!

1502
01:19:51.487 --> 01:19:52.487
Mom?

1503
01:20:00.060 --> 01:20:01.800
Broken.

1504
01:20:01.801 --> 01:20:02.801

Dear grace,

1508
01:20:29.350 --> 01:20:32.352
this is the 53rd letter
I won't be sending.


1509
01:20:32.353 --> 01:20:34.137
Every day I stay away

1510
01:20:34.138 --> 01:20:37.140
is a day you can make
your dreams come true.


1511
01:20:37.141 --> 01:20:40.099
You're going be the
most amazing writer.


1512
01:20:40.100 --> 01:20:43.363
You've already written the
best love story across my heart.


1513
01:20:43.364 --> 01:20:45.844
Love you always, Sean.

1514
01:20:50.067 --> 01:20:52.808
Sean green, I know
you can hear me!


1515
01:20:52.809 --> 01:20:53.809
Guess what?

1516
01:20:54.506 --> 01:20:56.202
You're too late!

1517
01:20:56.203 --> 01:20:58.248
53 letters too late!

1518
01:21:03.080 --> 01:21:05.168
This dress will look
better on you than me?


1519
01:21:11.088 --> 01:21:12.088
My turn.

1520
01:21:13.220 --> 01:21:15.178
Grace, I know you're a girl

1521
01:21:15.179 --> 01:21:17.354
of fairytales and
cinderella stories,


1522
01:21:17.355 --> 01:21:20.227
but maybe our
romance isn't that simple.


1523
01:21:22.665 --> 01:21:26.189
Maybe our love has
to break convention


1524
01:21:26.190 --> 01:21:29.105
for it to be real
outside of your books.


1525
01:21:29.106 --> 01:21:31.411
What are you doing here?

1526
01:21:31.412 --> 01:21:33.936
Winning you back.

1527
01:21:33.937 --> 01:21:34.937
Here.

1528
01:21:40.160 --> 01:21:41.248
Ask me anything.

1529
01:21:43.990 --> 01:21:45.251
Okay.

1530
01:21:45.252 --> 01:21:47.602
Why are you wearing a dress?

1531
01:21:47.603 --> 01:21:51.128
To make you laugh
and maybe let me in. Next.


1532
01:21:54.348 --> 01:21:58.090
Why didn't you tell me
that you were dating Heather?


1533
01:21:58.091 --> 01:21:59.266
I tried, but...

1534
01:22:01.617 --> 01:22:03.880
Things are never that simple.

1535
01:22:05.795 --> 01:22:07.622
I was hoping you
wouldn't have to find out.


1536
01:22:07.623 --> 01:22:09.362
So there could be
another secret between us?


1537
01:22:09.363 --> 01:22:12.149
Like all those letters
you never sent?


1538
01:22:14.281 --> 01:22:16.413
I never sent the letters,
because I was scared


1539
01:22:16.414 --> 01:22:20.069
that if I admitted
that I loved you,


1540
01:22:20.070 --> 01:22:22.549
you'd come back
to our small town


1541
01:22:22.550 --> 01:22:24.813
and leave your dreams behind.

1542
01:22:24.814 --> 01:22:26.553
I was scared that I
would distract you


1543
01:22:26.554 --> 01:22:29.078
from becoming who
you were meant to be.


1544
01:22:29.079 --> 01:22:32.124
You were never
a distraction, Sean.


1545
01:22:32.125 --> 01:22:34.911
You were my muse.
Don't you get that?


1546
01:22:36.434 --> 01:22:38.653
I was scared I...

1547
01:22:38.654 --> 01:22:43.222
Wouldn't ever be good
enough for you, grace.


1548
01:22:43.223 --> 01:22:47.140
Sean, you've always been
everything I ever wanted...


1549
01:22:49.708 --> 01:22:51.841
And exactly what I needed.

1550
01:22:53.843 --> 01:22:57.150
I've loved you from
the moment I saw you.


1551
01:22:59.675 --> 01:23:02.067
And that's never changed.

1552
01:23:02.068 --> 01:23:03.940
Please forgive me, grace.

1553
01:23:06.246 --> 01:23:07.291
Is it too late?

1554
01:23:13.427 --> 01:23:17.954
The truth is I could have
come home anytime to see you.


1555
01:23:19.042 --> 01:23:20.042
I was scared too.

1556
01:23:21.740 --> 01:23:23.698
I guess being disappointed

1557
01:23:23.699 --> 01:23:27.006
was easier than
taking a risk to get hurt.


1558
01:23:32.359 --> 01:23:36.101
And in my imagination,
love was always perfect.


1559
01:23:36.102 --> 01:23:37.974
But that's not real life.

1560
01:23:39.671 --> 01:23:41.020
Can we fix it?

1561
01:23:44.850 --> 01:23:48.461
It'll never be
too late for us.


1562
01:23:48.462 --> 01:23:51.290
Too bad it's too
late for the ball.


1563
01:23:51.291 --> 01:23:52.857
Then I guess it's a good thing

1564
01:23:52.858 --> 01:23:54.990
I already booked
two flights back home.


1565
01:23:54.991 --> 01:23:55.991
Wow!

1566
01:23:57.776 --> 01:23:59.472
You were really confident
you were gonna get me back.


1567
01:23:59.473 --> 01:24:01.474
I took a chance and
believed for a change.


1568
01:24:01.475 --> 01:24:02.562
Come on!

1569
01:24:02.563 --> 01:24:04.303
Let's catch that plane.

1570
01:24:05.436 --> 01:24:07.045
Wait.

1571
01:24:07.046 --> 01:24:08.655
What's wrong?

1572
01:24:08.656 --> 01:24:10.441
Do you mind if
I wear the dress?


1573
01:24:40.514 --> 01:24:42.690
I'll have to later about it.

1574
01:24:43.779 --> 01:24:45.736
This place is amazing,

1575
01:24:45.737 --> 01:24:48.826
even more spectacular
than I remember.


1576
01:24:48.827 --> 01:24:51.264
I have something to show you.

1577
01:24:55.051 --> 01:24:56.051
I love it!

1578
01:24:56.879 --> 01:24:58.619
We're leaving our Mark.

1579
01:25:02.841 --> 01:25:04.973
In the words of grandpa Albert,

1580
01:25:04.974 --> 01:25:07.932
if lovers carve their names
on the walls of the mansion,


1581
01:25:07.933 --> 01:25:11.981
the blue moon will see
to it that they are reunited.


1582
01:25:13.330 --> 01:25:15.288
I think I lost another bet.

1583
01:25:16.507 --> 01:25:18.551
But you kids were right.

1584
01:25:18.552 --> 01:25:22.120
Fate works in mysterious
and wonderful ways.


1585
01:25:22.121 --> 01:25:24.035
It wasn't fate.

1586
01:25:24.036 --> 01:25:27.517
It was respect and
communication.


1587
01:25:27.518 --> 01:25:30.346
Honesty and forgiveness.

1588
01:25:30.347 --> 01:25:31.738
Were finally both all in.

1589
01:25:31.739 --> 01:25:32.739
And ready.

1590
01:25:34.699 --> 01:25:36.656
Well, then I can
guarantee it's a relationship


1591
01:25:36.657 --> 01:25:40.182
that's gonna last,
one worth lasting.


1592
01:25:40.183 --> 01:25:41.487
May I have this dance?

1593
01:25:41.488 --> 01:25:42.619
I'd be delighted.

1594
01:25:43.882 --> 01:25:45.927
I think he was talking to me.

1595
01:25:45.928 --> 01:25:47.320
If you think so.

1596
01:25:49.801 --> 01:25:51.715
I heard there was
a young woman


1597
01:25:51.716 --> 01:25:54.152
in need of a dance partner.

1598
01:25:54.153 --> 01:25:58.330
Now, I've only got 15 minutes
before bed check at the home,


1599
01:25:58.331 --> 01:26:00.724
so hate to make this
a dance to remember!


1600
01:26:00.725 --> 01:26:02.160
Okay!

1601
01:26:17.176 --> 01:26:20.744
Sean, there's something
I need to tell you.


1602
01:26:20.745 --> 01:26:23.442
Please don't say you
want me in that dress again.


1603
01:26:23.443 --> 01:26:26.011
Despite how
cute you looked, no.


1604
01:26:27.752 --> 01:26:28.752
I...

1605
01:26:29.885 --> 01:26:32.538
I lost my publishing contract.

1606
01:26:32.539 --> 01:26:35.020
My agents hated my latest novel.

1607
01:26:38.894 --> 01:26:40.547
Grace, I'm so sorry.

1608
01:26:42.767 --> 01:26:43.767
Me too.

1609
01:26:45.335 --> 01:26:48.250
Can you try again
at a new version


1610
01:26:48.251 --> 01:26:50.253
now that your muse is back?

1611
01:26:51.907 --> 01:26:53.559
I could write the
best novel in the world


1612
01:26:53.560 --> 01:26:57.042
and I don't think he'd
give me a second chance.


1613
01:27:00.524 --> 01:27:05.094
Well, I might know someone
with a large sum of money


1614
01:27:06.269 --> 01:27:08.009
who's looking to invest.

1615
01:27:08.010 --> 01:27:10.054
It's a bit of a long
shot, but who knows?


1616
01:27:10.055 --> 01:27:12.709
The timing might be just right.

1617
01:27:12.710 --> 01:27:13.710
Really?

1618
01:27:15.365 --> 01:27:17.366
You think they've
read my novels?


1619
01:27:17.367 --> 01:27:18.367
Read them?

1620
01:27:20.892 --> 01:27:23.589
They're your biggest fan.

1621
01:27:23.590 --> 01:27:24.851
And they're here tonight.

1622
01:27:24.852 --> 01:27:27.289
Do you want me to introduce you?

1623
01:27:27.290 --> 01:27:29.074
Sean, that's amazing!

1624
01:27:30.380 --> 01:27:31.380
I love you.

1625
01:27:32.251 --> 01:27:33.556
Say it again.

1626
01:27:33.557 --> 01:27:34.557
I love you.

1627
01:27:35.472 --> 01:27:36.472
Again.

1628
01:27:37.256 --> 01:27:38.256
I love you.

1629
01:27:46.787 --> 01:27:48.572
I love you too, grace.

1630
01:27:55.187 --> 01:27:59.365
I'll get you a real engagement
ring, but until then...


1631
01:28:02.890 --> 01:28:04.327
Will you marry me?

1632
01:28:07.634 --> 01:28:10.333
You couldn't
stop me if you tried.


1633
01:28:18.558 --> 01:28:21.126
Now you have
lipstick all over you.


1634
01:28:23.563 --> 01:28:25.652
Who's that scary investor?

1635
01:28:34.357 --> 01:28:36.706
Grace, this is Heather.

1636
01:28:36.707 --> 01:28:37.968
Heather, grace.

1637
01:28:40.276 --> 01:28:41.276
Sean?

1638
01:28:42.800 --> 01:28:45.541
Sure, you've gone
to school together.


1639
01:28:45.542 --> 01:28:48.152
Maybe you've even
been friends at one point.


1640
01:28:48.153 --> 01:28:51.677
But you've never
been business partners.


1641
01:28:51.678 --> 01:28:53.157
What are you talking about?

1642
01:28:53.158 --> 01:28:55.072
You've wanted to
make a name for yourself


1643
01:28:55.073 --> 01:28:57.683
ever since your dad got you
tour first set of business cards


1644
01:28:57.684 --> 01:28:59.294
in the sixth grade.

1645
01:28:59.295 --> 01:29:03.428
You have money and
business sense but...


1646
01:29:03.429 --> 01:29:06.649
Not a stitch of creativity.

1647
01:29:06.650 --> 01:29:10.392
And grace, you're all
passion and creativity,


1648
01:29:10.393 --> 01:29:14.614
but completely lacking in
practical, commercial skills.


1649
01:29:16.268 --> 01:29:18.835
Sean, what are
you babbling about?


1650
01:29:18.836 --> 01:29:21.794
I think what he's
trying to say is...


1651
01:29:21.795 --> 01:29:25.015
I could really use your help.

1652
01:29:25.016 --> 01:29:26.712
I'm looking for
someone to invest


1653
01:29:26.713 --> 01:29:29.412
in the publication
of my third novel.


1654
01:29:35.635 --> 01:29:37.723
You want that person to be me?

1655
01:29:37.724 --> 01:29:39.508
I would love that.

1656
01:29:39.509 --> 01:29:40.509
He's right.

1657
01:29:41.598 --> 01:29:43.252
We'd make a good team.

1658
01:29:47.647 --> 01:29:48.995
A toast!

1659
01:30:03.576 --> 01:30:05.099
There you are.

1660
01:30:05.100 --> 01:30:06.753
My beautiful fiancee.

1661
01:30:18.025 --> 01:30:19.636
Everything all right?

1662
01:30:22.421 --> 01:30:24.640
Sean. I love you.

1663
01:30:24.641 --> 01:30:26.251
And I love this town.

1664
01:30:27.513 --> 01:30:28.513
But...

1665
01:30:31.561 --> 01:30:33.518
I don't think I can
live here anymore.


1666
01:30:33.519 --> 01:30:35.259
What?

1667
01:30:35.260 --> 01:30:38.044
My career and
my life are in la now.


1668
01:30:38.045 --> 01:30:39.394
You just lost your contract.

1669
01:30:39.395 --> 01:30:40.395
I know.

1670
01:30:41.614 --> 01:30:42.614
You're right.

1671
01:30:45.749 --> 01:30:48.098
We can make this work.

1672
01:30:48.099 --> 01:30:51.450
If you want to stay
here or come with me...


1673
01:30:53.191 --> 01:30:55.061
We can make it work this time.

1674
01:30:55.062 --> 01:30:58.369
Grace, this is crazy deja vu.

1675
01:30:58.370 --> 01:31:00.980
I can't believe
you're saying this.


1676
01:31:00.981 --> 01:31:03.722
I know, and I'm sorry.

1677
01:31:03.723 --> 01:31:07.640
But I've been out here
trying to figure it out and...


1678
01:31:09.816 --> 01:31:13.298
I know that if I stay
here, I won't be happy...


1679
01:31:14.560 --> 01:31:15.952
And that's gonna hurt us.

1680
01:31:15.953 --> 01:31:18.651
Maybe not
immediately, but in time.


1681
01:31:21.088 --> 01:31:22.960
Please just come with me.

1682
01:31:26.485 --> 01:31:30.706
I have an old house
I'm renovating that I love.


1683
01:31:30.707 --> 01:31:32.838
And I have a job here.

1684
01:31:32.839 --> 01:31:35.494
This is where we're
supposed to be.


1685
01:31:38.149 --> 01:31:40.585
I can't believe
I'm hearing this.


1686
01:31:40.586 --> 01:31:41.717
Sean-

1687
01:31:41.718 --> 01:31:43.110
- no, I need to think.

1688
01:32:08.353 --> 01:32:10.877
I am such a huge fan of yours!

1689
01:32:12.662 --> 01:32:14.924
I can't believe that
I'm finally meeting you!


1690
01:32:14.925 --> 01:32:16.405
That is so sweet.

1691
01:32:20.844 --> 01:32:21.844
There you go.

1692
01:32:24.717 --> 01:32:26.979
Ester!

1693
01:32:26.980 --> 01:32:29.199
I think it's about time I
get a signed copy of my own.


1694
01:32:29.200 --> 01:32:31.419
Of course.

1695
01:32:31.420 --> 01:32:32.203
If I had known, I would
have had one ready for you.


1696
01:32:32.204 --> 01:32:33.899
Oh, that's all right.

1697
01:32:33.900 --> 01:32:36.206
I was hoping to
meet your new Beau.


1698
01:32:36.207 --> 01:32:37.860
He's not here.

1699
01:32:37.861 --> 01:32:38.992
I am so sorry!

1700
01:32:40.080 --> 01:32:41.865
Excuse me, excuse me.

1701
01:32:43.040 --> 01:32:44.040
I'm sorry I'm late.

1702
01:32:48.393 --> 01:32:51.743
So this is the man
worth 90,000 words.


1703
01:32:54.399 --> 01:32:57.097
I think I'd like
your signature too.


1704
01:33:00.753 --> 01:33:02.101
I love you.

1705
01:33:02.102 --> 01:33:03.495
I love you too.
