1
00:00:06.124 --> 00:00:07.883
- Previously on "All Stars"...

2
00:00:07.952 --> 00:00:09.952
- It's just the feeling of...

3
00:00:10.021 --> 00:00:11.883
they're not seeing me.

4
00:00:11.952 --> 00:00:14.676
I contemplated
getting up and leaving.


5
00:00:14.745 --> 00:00:16.848
- For this week's
maxi challenge,


6
00:00:16.917 --> 00:00:19.331
you need to create trailers

7
00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:21.917
for a sickening scripted series.

8
00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:25.307
- Well, Heidi,
how are you feeling now?


9
00:00:25.331 --> 00:00:26.790
Because I know last week
you were fed up.


10
00:00:26.814 --> 00:00:28.641
Over it, bitch.

11
00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.400
- I'm flustered
at the moment by Kandy


12
00:00:31.469 --> 00:00:33.952
because I'm in this alliance
with Jimbo and Kandy


13
00:00:34.021 --> 00:00:35.859
and we're supposed to be
watching each other's backs.


14
00:00:35.883 --> 00:00:37.341
Okay, baby, if y'all
want to play this game,


15
00:00:37.365 --> 00:00:38.962
baby, I'll spill all your
motherfuckin' tea out here,


16
00:00:38.986 --> 00:00:40.400
baby.
- Ooh.


17
00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:42.031
- I'll spill all the tea
that's behind the scenes.


18
00:00:42.055 --> 00:00:44.848
I have tea that will burn
this competition down.


19
00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:50.365
- Did just hear that?
- The ocean?


20
00:00:50.434 --> 00:00:51.469
Yeah.

21
00:00:51.538 --> 00:00:53.607
- No, voices.

22
00:00:53.676 --> 00:00:56.400
- Your sketch was pleasant.

23
00:00:56.469 --> 00:00:59.227
It wasn't the laugh riot
that I know


24
00:00:59.296 --> 00:01:01.296
that you kids can deliver.

25
00:01:01.365 --> 00:01:04.124
Jaymes Mansfield, 
Darienne Lake,

26
00:01:04.192 --> 00:01:06.055
Alexis Michelle,

27
00:01:06.124 --> 00:01:10.365
you are the bottom All Stars
of the week.


28
00:01:10.434 --> 00:01:15.710
Jimbo, condragulations, you are
the top All Star of the week.


29
00:01:15.779 --> 00:01:18.055
- Yes.

30
00:01:18.123 --> 00:01:22.434
- It's time to present
this week's lip-sync assassin.


31
00:01:26.572 --> 00:01:31.227
Shannel, condragulations,
you're a winner, baby.


32
00:01:31.296 --> 00:01:36.745
Which queen has the group
chosen to get the chop?


33
00:01:36.813 --> 00:01:38.090
- Darienne.

34
00:01:38.158 --> 00:01:40.779
- Darienne Lake,
you're leaving us tonight,


35
00:01:40.848 --> 00:01:44.400
but the Fame Games
have just begun.


36
00:01:44.468 --> 00:01:48.262
Now sashay away.

37
00:01:54.538 --> 00:01:56.641
- Yes.
- Whoo!


38
00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:58.262
- All right.

39
00:01:58.331 --> 00:02:00.331
- My God.
- Whoo!


40
00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:02.848
- Another one for Jimbo.

41
00:02:05.227 --> 00:02:06.227
My God.

42
00:02:06.262 --> 00:02:08.952
Darienne Lake has gone home.

43
00:02:09.021 --> 00:02:11.203
And I'm trying to look at
the positive of the situation.


44
00:02:11.227 --> 00:02:14.572
I did just lose a friend here,
but I also finally


45
00:02:14.641 --> 00:02:16.676
gained that closet space.

46
00:02:16.745 --> 00:02:19.848
- "Darienne was here twice.

47
00:02:19.917 --> 00:02:23.883
Love and laughs, see you soon?"
Question mark.


48
00:02:23.952 --> 00:02:25.331
Maybe there's a twist.

49
00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:27.520
- Girl, she don't know shit.

50
00:02:29.641 --> 00:02:31.241
- We love you, Darienne.
- Bye, Darienne.


51
00:02:31.296 --> 00:02:32.434
- Bye, Darienne.

52
00:02:32.503 --> 00:02:33.503
- Bye, honey.

53
00:02:33.538 --> 00:02:34.469
- Mwah. Mwah.

54
00:02:34.538 --> 00:02:35.814
You cleaned that, my God.

55
00:02:35.883 --> 00:02:38.848
- Yeah, thanks,
you need me to do your face?


56
00:02:38.917 --> 00:02:40.710
- No, I need to do Heidi's face.

57
00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:43.917
- Y'all are hateful,
and I look like


58
00:02:43.986 --> 00:02:45.266
the sexiest donkey in the world.

59
00:02:45.296 --> 00:02:46.410
Y'all be jealous.
- It's true.


60
00:02:46.434 --> 00:02:47.952
- You're the sexiest jackass
in town.


61
00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:51.124
- The only jackass in town,
let's be honest, honey.


62
00:02:53.641 --> 00:02:54.790
- Can we play
"Pin the Tail on the Heidi"?


63
00:02:54.814 --> 00:02:55.962
- You want to pin the tail
on me?


64
00:02:55.986 --> 00:02:57.538
Sure, I'm down.

65
00:02:57.607 --> 00:02:58.952
Hit it, hit it!

66
00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:00.055
- There we go.

67
00:03:00.124 --> 00:03:01.676
- I'm a Christian woman!

68
00:03:01.745 --> 00:03:03.503
- Speaking of pinning the tail,
honey,


69
00:03:03.572 --> 00:03:05.021
you have pinned two wins.

70
00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:06.021
My God.

71
00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:07.883
Thank you.

72
00:03:07.952 --> 00:03:09.538
Thank you, everybody.

73
00:03:09.607 --> 00:03:11.503
I'm excited about it.

74
00:03:11.572 --> 00:03:12.814
- Let's count these votes

75
00:03:12.883 --> 00:03:14.952
and see what we got in this box.

76
00:03:15.021 --> 00:03:16.503
The mystery box.

77
00:03:16.572 --> 00:03:19.469
- Let's see what's in my box.

78
00:03:20.814 --> 00:03:22.745
One for Darienne.

79
00:03:24.572 --> 00:03:25.745
One for Jaymes.

80
00:03:27.848 --> 00:03:28.779
Interesting.

81
00:03:28.848 --> 00:03:31.021
- Two for Darienne.

82
00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:33.055
Three for Darienne.

83
00:03:33.124 --> 00:03:34.572
Four for Darienne.

84
00:03:34.641 --> 00:03:37.883
Five, six, and seven.

85
00:03:37.952 --> 00:03:39.090
Darienne.

86
00:03:39.157 --> 00:03:40.548
That Jaymes is
probably Darienne.


87
00:03:40.572 --> 00:03:43.055
- I did vote for her
three times in a row.


88
00:03:43.124 --> 00:03:44.272
- And Jimbo, yeah, what was...

89
00:03:44.296 --> 00:03:45.400
Who'd you show?

90
00:03:45.469 --> 00:03:47.986
- What's in your titty?

91
00:03:48.055 --> 00:03:49.583
- Sorry, Alexis, I know
this is your wedding night


92
00:03:49.607 --> 00:03:53.193
and everything, and...

93
00:03:53.262 --> 00:03:54.883
I just had to pick Darienne.

94
00:03:56.917 --> 00:04:00.607
I just wanted to make you sweat.

95
00:04:00.676 --> 00:04:04.365
- Jimbo is the first girl
to win twice now,


96
00:04:04.434 --> 00:04:06.986
and I'm sure she's feeling
on top of the world.


97
00:04:12.227 --> 00:04:14.055
- But here's the problem.

98
00:04:14.124 --> 00:04:16.479
In this game, you don't want
to be seen as the front runner.


99
00:04:16.503 --> 00:04:17.917
Then you're a threat
to everybody.


100
00:04:19.744 --> 00:04:21.262
Some girls might be
taking notice,


101
00:04:21.331 --> 00:04:23.883
and I would not be surprised
if they're starting


102
00:04:23.952 --> 00:04:26.262
to think about sending
her home as soon


103
00:04:26.331 --> 00:04:28.434
as she lands in the bottom.

104
00:04:28.503 --> 00:04:32.400
Jimbo, if I were you,
I'd sleep with one tit open.


105
00:04:39.503 --> 00:04:41.538
The winner of "RuPaul's
Drag Race All Stars"


106
00:04:41.607 --> 00:04:42.986
receives a one-year supply

107
00:04:43.055 --> 00:04:45.745
of Anastasia Beverly Hills
cosmetics,


108
00:04:45.814 --> 00:04:48.572
a coveted spot in
the "Drag Race" Hall of Fame,


109
00:04:48.641 --> 00:04:52.090
and a cash prize of $200,000,

110
00:04:52.158 --> 00:04:54.193
with extra-special guest judges

111
00:04:54.262 --> 00:04:56.331
Matt Rogers and Bowen Yang.

112
00:05:07.745 --> 00:05:08.952
- She's safe.

113
00:05:09.021 --> 00:05:11.365
- It's a brand-new week.
- Yes.


114
00:05:11.434 --> 00:05:13.090
You feeling good?

115
00:05:13.158 --> 00:05:14.434
Okay.

116
00:05:14.503 --> 00:05:15.863
- It is a new day
in the Werk Room,


117
00:05:15.917 --> 00:05:17.296
which means it's a fresh slate.

118
00:05:17.365 --> 00:05:19.090
So that
being in the bottom thing,


119
00:05:19.158 --> 00:05:20.365
that didn't happen.

120
00:05:20.434 --> 00:05:21.952
We're not remembering that part.

121
00:05:22.021 --> 00:05:24.227
We're gonna start this day
with a positive attitude


122
00:05:24.296 --> 00:05:25.572
if it kills me.

123
00:05:25.641 --> 00:05:27.296
- Do you want a bite
of my apple, LaLa?


124
00:05:27.365 --> 00:05:29.641
- Ooh, LaLa, that tongue.

125
00:05:31.572 --> 00:05:34.193
- You saw that, you saw that.

126
00:05:34.262 --> 00:05:36.158
Look at her smile.

127
00:05:36.227 --> 00:05:38.503
She's just like, "Yes."

128
00:05:38.572 --> 00:05:40.227
- You is a horny bitch.

129
00:05:40.296 --> 00:05:41.445
- I thought I was the horny one.

130
00:05:41.469 --> 00:05:42.676
- My God.
- You loved it.


131
00:05:42.745 --> 00:05:44.779
- My poor mother.

132
00:05:47.227 --> 00:05:48.400
- There we go, there we go.

133
00:05:48.469 --> 00:05:51.331
- She done already
done had herses.


134
00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:53.814
- Hi, All Stars.
- Hi, Ru!


135
00:05:53.883 --> 00:05:55.572
You know,
when I was a young queen,


136
00:05:55.641 --> 00:05:59.124
I used to wonder,
where do broken hearts go?


137
00:05:59.193 --> 00:06:01.917
Well, now
I'm a little bit older,


138
00:06:01.986 --> 00:06:03.538
a little bit wiser,

139
00:06:03.607 --> 00:06:08.676
and today I wonder,
where do broken hips go?


140
00:06:08.745 --> 00:06:11.917
No really, think about it.

141
00:06:11.986 --> 00:06:12.986
- Broken hips?

142
00:06:13.021 --> 00:06:14.572
- Broken hips and hearts?

143
00:06:14.641 --> 00:06:17.710
- I don't know
what the hell that means.


144
00:06:17.779 --> 00:06:20.986
- Hello, hello, hello,
ladies, hi.


145
00:06:21.055 --> 00:06:21.986
- Yeah, girl.

146
00:06:22.055 --> 00:06:23.434
- God, you guys match.

147
00:06:23.503 --> 00:06:24.676
- Ladykins.

148
00:06:24.745 --> 00:06:26.365
Hi.

149
00:06:26.434 --> 00:06:28.607
- I hope your pussies
are on fire.


150
00:06:28.676 --> 00:06:30.021
- Still burning.

151
00:06:30.090 --> 00:06:31.952
- Because for this week's
maxi challenge,


152
00:06:32.021 --> 00:06:35.469
it's time to play
Snatch Game of Love.


153
00:06:37.917 --> 00:06:39.710
- Yes, okay.

154
00:06:39.779 --> 00:06:41.883
- #AllStars8.

155
00:06:41.952 --> 00:06:44.607
Now, you need to deliver
your funniest celebrity


156
00:06:44.676 --> 00:06:48.883
impersonation as you try
to charm the pants


157
00:06:48.952 --> 00:06:51.848
off of a foxy Snatchelor.

158
00:06:53.814 --> 00:06:55.607
Ever done that before?

159
00:06:55.676 --> 00:06:57.021
- Well.

160
00:06:57.090 --> 00:06:59.745
- All Stars, start your engines,

161
00:06:59.814 --> 00:07:02.158
and may the best drag queen win.

162
00:07:05.745 --> 00:07:07.986
- I wonder who our
Snatchelor is gonna be.


163
00:07:08.055 --> 00:07:08.986
- Right?

164
00:07:09.055 --> 00:07:12.365
- I can finally find me a man.

165
00:07:12.434 --> 00:07:19.055
- Ooh, today's maxi challenge
is the Snatch Game of Love.


166
00:07:20.883 --> 00:07:22.193
Bitch.

167
00:07:22.262 --> 00:07:23.538
How you feeling?

168
00:07:23.607 --> 00:07:25.745
- You didn't do a Snatch Game
in our season.


169
00:07:25.814 --> 00:07:27.469
- Don't remind me.
Do not remind me.


170
00:07:27.538 --> 00:07:28.538
- You got sent home.

171
00:07:28.572 --> 00:07:30.124
- You didn't have to say
all that.


172
00:07:30.193 --> 00:07:32.307
You could have just stopped at
you didn't do the Snatch Game.


173
00:07:32.331 --> 00:07:33.790
This is my first time.
I'm a baby at this.


174
00:07:33.814 --> 00:07:35.193
I'm new to this.

175
00:07:35.262 --> 00:07:37.400
So I gotta try my best
to keep up with these hos.


176
00:07:37.469 --> 00:07:39.814
Because you can excel
at Snatch Game,


177
00:07:39.883 --> 00:07:42.193
but you're one to look out for.

178
00:07:42.262 --> 00:07:44.434
I'm doing
Suki With The Good Coochie.


179
00:07:44.503 --> 00:07:47.124
- Sukihana.
- From "Love & Hip Hop."


180
00:07:47.193 --> 00:07:48.883
"Love & Hip Hop Miami."
- Yes, indeed.


181
00:07:48.952 --> 00:07:50.572
- Ooh, she a nasty bitch.

182
00:07:50.641 --> 00:07:51.676
- She is nasty.

183
00:07:51.745 --> 00:07:53.917
Sukihana is a reality TV star

184
00:07:53.986 --> 00:07:55.814
who is also a rapper,

185
00:07:55.883 --> 00:07:58.227
plastic surgery advocate...

186
00:07:58.296 --> 00:07:59.686
You know, just search her name,
honey.


187
00:07:59.710 --> 00:08:01.952
You'll find some things
about her, honey.


188
00:08:02.021 --> 00:08:05.331
And I can just have fun
with her, you know?


189
00:08:05.400 --> 00:08:08.331
My God, this is beautiful.

190
00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:09.917
Let me try it.

191
00:08:09.986 --> 00:08:12.572
Let's see if some of your
dancing rubs off on me.


192
00:08:12.641 --> 00:08:14.434
- Tonight on
the Snatch Game of Love,


193
00:08:14.503 --> 00:08:17.641
I'm going to be
our Puerto Rican idol


194
00:08:17.710 --> 00:08:19.538
Iris Chacón.

195
00:08:19.607 --> 00:08:21.814
La Vedette De America.

196
00:08:21.883 --> 00:08:25.262
Before J.Lo, we have
Iris Chacón in Puerto Rico.


197
00:08:25.331 --> 00:08:27.296
Even David Letterman called her

198
00:08:27.365 --> 00:08:29.227
the Dolly Parton of Puerto Rico.

199
00:08:29.296 --> 00:08:30.652
- That could be a lot of
pressure doing someone


200
00:08:30.676 --> 00:08:31.745
that's so beloved, though.

201
00:08:31.814 --> 00:08:32.893
Are you sure
you can handle that?


202
00:08:32.917 --> 00:08:33.848
- Yeah, of course I can handle.

203
00:08:33.917 --> 00:08:34.917
- Okay.

204
00:08:36.124 --> 00:08:37.514
- If I did RuPaul
in front of RuPaul,


205
00:08:37.538 --> 00:08:38.434
I can do anything, girl.

206
00:08:38.503 --> 00:08:39.814
- Right.

207
00:08:39.883 --> 00:08:41.410
Bravery is not something
that's a stranger to you.


208
00:08:41.434 --> 00:08:42.951
- I'm brave, I'm brave.

209
00:08:43.021 --> 00:08:47.641
On season two, I have to be
part of the first Snatch Game


210
00:08:47.710 --> 00:08:50.193
ever in "RuPaul's Drag Race"
history.


211
00:08:50.262 --> 00:08:53.883
The time has come now for you
to lip synch for your life.


212
00:08:53.952 --> 00:08:57.434
I didn't win, but I think
I kill it on that challenge.


213
00:08:57.503 --> 00:09:01.538
This time my plan is
to take home this Snatchelor


214
00:09:01.607 --> 00:09:05.090
and my second winning.

215
00:09:05.158 --> 00:09:06.883
- What about you, Jaymes?
Who are you doing?


216
00:09:06.952 --> 00:09:08.158
- I'm doing Jennifer Coolidge.

217
00:09:08.227 --> 00:09:09.952
- Ooh, yes.

218
00:09:10.021 --> 00:09:11.400
- I know,
I'm going against type.


219
00:09:11.469 --> 00:09:13.986
You're not very pretty,
and you're not very bright.


220
00:09:14.055 --> 00:09:15.548
My gosh,
you sound just like her.


221
00:09:15.572 --> 00:09:16.848
- I've been working on it.

222
00:09:16.917 --> 00:09:20.227
Jennifer Coolidge
is a gay icon, okay?


223
00:09:20.296 --> 00:09:22.538
She's a goddess
on the tiers of goddesses


224
00:09:22.607 --> 00:09:23.848
as far as we're concerned.

225
00:09:23.917 --> 00:09:26.158
- Makes me want a hot dog...
- Real bad.


226
00:09:26.227 --> 00:09:27.538
- The pressure is on.

227
00:09:27.607 --> 00:09:29.400
Like, I have to deliver, okay?

228
00:09:29.469 --> 00:09:32.745
Like, my gay card might get
pulled if I fuck this up.


229
00:09:32.814 --> 00:09:33.997
I haven't done
a Snatch Game before.


230
00:09:34.021 --> 00:09:35.193
- Your first Snatch Game.

231
00:09:35.262 --> 00:09:36.814
- I don't really know
what to expect.


232
00:09:36.883 --> 00:09:38.928
We were both in the bottom last
week, so this is our chance


233
00:09:38.952 --> 00:09:39.883
to claw our way back up.

234
00:09:39.952 --> 00:09:41.538
- That's right.

235
00:09:44.158 --> 00:09:45.307
- We're both Snatch
Game winners.


236
00:09:45.331 --> 00:09:47.021
- Yes, we are.
- Come on, legends only.


237
00:09:47.090 --> 00:09:48.607
- Come on, legends.

238
00:09:48.676 --> 00:09:49.956
I don't know, do you feel, like,

239
00:09:50.021 --> 00:09:51.331
extra pressure or whatever?

240
00:09:51.400 --> 00:09:52.572
- I do.

241
00:09:52.641 --> 00:09:53.962
Spotlight's gonna be
on us to do well.


242
00:09:53.986 --> 00:09:55.296
- Yeah.

243
00:09:55.365 --> 00:09:57.538
- But I feel like having
that pressure will


244
00:09:57.607 --> 00:10:00.676
help us rise to the challenge.

245
00:10:00.745 --> 00:10:02.917
- Yeah.

246
00:10:02.986 --> 00:10:05.365
- I won my Snatch Game
on season nine


247
00:10:05.434 --> 00:10:07.572
as the one and only Liza.

248
00:10:07.641 --> 00:10:10.400
It's Liza with a
Z. It has a Z.

249
00:10:10.469 --> 00:10:11.469
- Liza with a Z.

250
00:10:11.503 --> 00:10:12.434
- Yes, yes.

251
00:10:12.503 --> 00:10:14.607
I have a legacy to live up to.

252
00:10:16.055 --> 00:10:18.158
- That comes with
a lot of pressure.


253
00:10:18.227 --> 00:10:20.986
I am going to be one
of the great ladies


254
00:10:21.055 --> 00:10:23.710
of stage and screen, Bea Arthur.

255
00:10:23.779 --> 00:10:25.158
My God.

256
00:10:25.227 --> 00:10:27.400
- Having done such an icon
last time


257
00:10:27.469 --> 00:10:28.676
and excelled at it,

258
00:10:28.745 --> 00:10:30.641
I did not want to take
a step back.


259
00:10:30.710 --> 00:10:35.021
Bea Arthur is this titan
of show biz, and I love Bea,


260
00:10:35.090 --> 00:10:36.917
and I know RuPaul loves Bea.

261
00:10:36.986 --> 00:10:39.745
It's a big risk, but I'm
still waiting on my first win.


262
00:10:39.814 --> 00:10:41.814
So this is my moment to shine.

263
00:10:41.883 --> 00:10:44.227
My God,
what's all this, your diary?


264
00:10:44.296 --> 00:10:46.710
- My notes.

265
00:10:46.779 --> 00:10:50.021
- Jesus, God, you've even got
math at the top.


266
00:10:50.090 --> 00:10:53.538
I would say that Alexis
is definitely


267
00:10:53.607 --> 00:10:55.365
my biggest competition
this week.


268
00:10:55.434 --> 00:10:59.227
- Don't touch,
you fucking chaotic bitch.


269
00:10:59.296 --> 00:11:02.262
- But I'd like to say that
pressure makes the diamond.


270
00:11:02.331 --> 00:11:04.193
LaLa.

271
00:11:04.262 --> 00:11:05.469
- I want a piggyback ride.

272
00:11:05.538 --> 00:11:07.641
Okay, let's go.

273
00:11:08.745 --> 00:11:09.779
Wow.

274
00:11:11.296 --> 00:11:12.572
My God.

275
00:11:13.814 --> 00:11:15.883
The LaLa express.

276
00:11:15.952 --> 00:11:17.607
Alexis, are you jealous?

277
00:11:17.676 --> 00:11:19.090
I got to ride LaLa.

278
00:11:19.158 --> 00:11:20.090
She's fuming.

279
00:11:20.158 --> 00:11:22.021
Absolutely fuming.

280
00:11:24.503 --> 00:11:26.543
My God, this is one of
my favorite things to do.


281
00:11:26.607 --> 00:11:28.158
Can I help you?
- Clean my titties?


282
00:11:28.227 --> 00:11:29.158
- Yes.

283
00:11:29.227 --> 00:11:30.503
- Of course, girl, have at it.

284
00:11:30.572 --> 00:11:32.296
- I'm one of the best
titty cleaners around.


285
00:11:32.365 --> 00:11:35.469
My God, not a white
person cleaning for me.


286
00:11:35.538 --> 00:11:37.090
Change has come.

287
00:11:38.676 --> 00:11:40.331
- Hey, All Stars.

288
00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:42.400
Hi.

289
00:11:42.469 --> 00:11:44.814
- Who's single
and ready to tingle?


290
00:11:44.883 --> 00:11:47.021
Ooh.

291
00:11:47.090 --> 00:11:48.021
- Okay.

292
00:11:48.090 --> 00:11:50.848
Kahanna, come on over.

293
00:11:50.917 --> 00:11:52.469
Okay.

294
00:11:52.538 --> 00:11:57.021
You came over with just a big
container of cheese balls.


295
00:11:57.090 --> 00:11:58.538
- That's what I'm using
as my makeup.


296
00:11:58.607 --> 00:11:59.607
Okay.

297
00:11:59.641 --> 00:12:01.124
So you are a Montrese.

298
00:12:02.503 --> 00:12:05.710
Yes, I'm paying homage
to my mother, Coco.


299
00:12:05.779 --> 00:12:07.952
- How does someone do
Coco Montrese?


300
00:12:08.021 --> 00:12:09.821
I know you have
the orange cheese puffs there.


301
00:12:11.227 --> 00:12:14.262
- She was criticized
for the orange makeup


302
00:12:14.331 --> 00:12:15.331
by Alyssa Edwards.

303
00:12:16.745 --> 00:12:18.676
- Girl, look how orange
you fuckin' look, girl.


304
00:12:18.745 --> 00:12:21.124
- I'm not joking, bitch.

305
00:12:21.193 --> 00:12:23.641
- Have you ever performed
as her before?


306
00:12:23.710 --> 00:12:24.779
- Yes, I actually have.

307
00:12:24.848 --> 00:12:26.400
I actually did her
for Halloween.


308
00:12:26.469 --> 00:12:27.997
That was one of the times
that literally


309
00:12:28.021 --> 00:12:29.503
I was just letting loose.

310
00:12:29.572 --> 00:12:31.652
And I feel like this is
what I need for this challenge,


311
00:12:31.676 --> 00:12:33.538
because I've been
kind of in my head


312
00:12:33.607 --> 00:12:35.883
when it comes to acting
and, like, being funny.


313
00:12:35.952 --> 00:12:38.055
If I can just channel
that energy


314
00:12:38.124 --> 00:12:40.607
that I did for Halloween
and having fun as her,


315
00:12:40.676 --> 00:12:42.641
I know that this could probably
help me get a win.


316
00:12:42.710 --> 00:12:44.262
- That's right.

317
00:12:44.331 --> 00:12:48.469
Just make sure you make Coco
proud and you make her funny.


318
00:12:48.538 --> 00:12:50.021
Go get to work
and make me laugh.


319
00:12:50.090 --> 00:12:51.021
- All right. I got you.

320
00:12:51.090 --> 00:12:52.227
- All right. Thanks.

321
00:12:52.296 --> 00:12:54.779
Jimbo, come on over.

322
00:12:56.331 --> 00:12:59.710
Okay, you have on Mary Jane
shoes and a curly wig.


323
00:12:59.779 --> 00:13:01.238
I don't even have to guess
who this is.


324
00:13:01.262 --> 00:13:02.193
- Who is it?

325
00:13:02.262 --> 00:13:03.400
- It's Shirley Temple.

326
00:13:03.469 --> 00:13:04.917
- It's Little Miss Miracle.

327
00:13:04.986 --> 00:13:07.262
- Now, you were on
the Canadian version


328
00:13:07.331 --> 00:13:08.883
Snatch Game."

329
00:13:08.952 --> 00:13:10.262
- I won.
- You did.


330
00:13:10.331 --> 00:13:11.445
What character did you play?

331
00:13:11.469 --> 00:13:14.952
I was Joan goddamn Rivers.

332
00:13:15.021 --> 00:13:17.572
Brook Lynn, I'm wondering
what the hell I did in my life


333
00:13:17.641 --> 00:13:19.676
to end up in the bottom
of a wastebasket


334
00:13:19.745 --> 00:13:21.193
with these hair balls.

335
00:13:21.262 --> 00:13:23.676
- And then when you did
"UK vs the World,"


336
00:13:23.745 --> 00:13:24.883
you did not.

337
00:13:24.952 --> 00:13:26.917
You're doing that
in a somber way.


338
00:13:26.986 --> 00:13:28.710
Is it because
you were gone by then?


339
00:13:32.262 --> 00:13:35.538
- I wanted to play it with you
so bad.


340
00:13:35.607 --> 00:13:37.952
- I have high expectations
on this.


341
00:13:38.021 --> 00:13:40.572
Now, have you performed
as Shirley Temple before?


342
00:13:40.641 --> 00:13:42.986
- I have never been
Shirley Temple.


343
00:13:43.055 --> 00:13:45.331
I've never even tried
this costume on before.


344
00:13:45.400 --> 00:13:47.469
I am taking a risk.

345
00:13:47.538 --> 00:13:49.331
- I love that.
As long as she's funny.


346
00:13:49.400 --> 00:13:50.779
- I'm gonna be sweet as pie.

347
00:13:52.365 --> 00:13:54.745
- Now it's my moment
to finally do


348
00:13:54.814 --> 00:13:56.814
an American Snatch Game
with Mama Ru.


349
00:13:56.883 --> 00:13:58.090
I just want to make Ru laugh,

350
00:13:58.158 --> 00:13:59.376
I want to make the judges laugh,

351
00:13:59.400 --> 00:14:01.883
and I want to do
this character justice.


352
00:14:01.952 --> 00:14:03.538
- Heidi N Closet.
- Hi, darling.


353
00:14:03.607 --> 00:14:04.538
- Let me guess.

354
00:14:04.607 --> 00:14:05.607
You're playing a pirate.

355
00:14:06.883 --> 00:14:08.883
Blackbeard the pirate.
- Okay.


356
00:14:08.952 --> 00:14:10.917
Have you ever played
Blackbeard before?


357
00:14:10.986 --> 00:14:12.790
- I've never played Blackbeard,
but I do like booty.


358
00:14:12.814 --> 00:14:14.090
So you know.

359
00:14:14.158 --> 00:14:16.331
- Okay, yeah, you have
something in common.


360
00:14:16.400 --> 00:14:20.676
So, Heidi, so far you have
not won a main challenge.


361
00:14:20.745 --> 00:14:22.124
Are you disappointed?

362
00:14:22.193 --> 00:14:24.227
- Not necessarily disappointed,

363
00:14:24.296 --> 00:14:26.917
but it's a pressure cooker
in here and it's like,


364
00:14:26.986 --> 00:14:28.296
it can get to you at times.

365
00:14:28.365 --> 00:14:30.365
And also that's just how it is.

366
00:14:30.434 --> 00:14:32.917
I gotta be in the moment
and have fun.


367
00:14:32.986 --> 00:14:34.134
I remember on season 12,
you told me,


368
00:14:34.158 --> 00:14:35.193
"Just have fun, bitch."

369
00:14:35.262 --> 00:14:36.434
- Yes, please have fun.

370
00:14:36.503 --> 00:14:38.331
Because you are
a naturally funny person.


371
00:14:38.400 --> 00:14:40.641
You're naturally charismatic.

372
00:14:40.710 --> 00:14:42.745
- Well, thank you.
I appreciate that.


373
00:14:42.814 --> 00:14:44.745
Being here is definitely taxing.

374
00:14:44.814 --> 00:14:48.469
And sometimes I kind of let
the competition get to me.


375
00:14:48.538 --> 00:14:50.710
But I need to remember
that I'm here to have fun


376
00:14:50.779 --> 00:14:52.296
and show off what I got.

377
00:14:52.365 --> 00:14:56.124
So I'm gonna worry about Heidi
and Blackbeard the pirate.


378
00:14:56.193 --> 00:14:57.193
Arr.

379
00:15:07.193 --> 00:15:11.607
- From the heart of Hollywood,
it's the Snatch Game of Love.


380
00:15:11.676 --> 00:15:15.055
And here's the Snatchmaker
himself, RuPaul.


381
00:15:16.676 --> 00:15:19.055
- Welcome, lovers.

382
00:15:19.124 --> 00:15:21.296
Let's get to the heart
of the matter


383
00:15:21.365 --> 00:15:24.400
and meet our celebrity
Snatchelorettes.


384
00:15:24.469 --> 00:15:27.262
First up, well,
shiver me timbers.


385
00:15:27.331 --> 00:15:30.090
It's Blackbeard the pirate.

386
00:15:30.158 --> 00:15:32.676
- Yo-ho-ho, honey,
I'm here, honey, yes.


387
00:15:32.745 --> 00:15:34.434
- Is that a wooden leg?

388
00:15:34.503 --> 00:15:36.400
- Baby, I got a third, honey.

389
00:15:38.883 --> 00:15:43.572
- Up next, the Puerto Rican
bombshell, Iris Chacón.


390
00:15:45.365 --> 00:15:48.021
Now, what kind of man
are you looking for?


391
00:15:48.090 --> 00:15:51.848
- I'm looking for...
- Sausage and eggs.


392
00:15:53.262 --> 00:15:55.021
So you're
a breakfast queen, are you?


393
00:15:55.090 --> 00:15:57.055
- I'm hungry, Ru.

394
00:15:58.883 --> 00:16:01.814
- Up next,
it's Drag Race royalty.


395
00:16:01.883 --> 00:16:04.021
Coco Montrese is here.

396
00:16:04.090 --> 00:16:05.021
- That's right.

397
00:16:05.090 --> 00:16:06.331
I'm back.

398
00:16:06.400 --> 00:16:07.680
I know y'all called
Alyssa first.


399
00:16:07.710 --> 00:16:08.641
- Yeah.

400
00:16:08.710 --> 00:16:09.986
- But you know what?

401
00:16:10.055 --> 00:16:12.434
When it comes to love,
I'm no runner up, bitch.


402
00:16:13.503 --> 00:16:14.917
- Okay.

403
00:16:14.986 --> 00:16:18.331
Up next,
she's always best in show,


404
00:16:18.400 --> 00:16:19.331
Jennifer Coolidge.

405
00:16:19.400 --> 00:16:20.331
Hi.

406
00:16:20.400 --> 00:16:21.503
- Hi.

407
00:16:21.572 --> 00:16:23.021
- How's that white lotus?

408
00:16:23.090 --> 00:16:25.210
- You'll have to wait till
after the show to see that.


409
00:16:26.883 --> 00:16:28.814
- Now it's time
to play the game.


410
00:16:28.883 --> 00:16:31.883
So let's close that sugar wall.

411
00:16:31.952 --> 00:16:34.021
- Bye.

412
00:16:34.090 --> 00:16:37.158
- Let's meet
our first Snatchelor.


413
00:16:37.227 --> 00:16:41.710
He's a Pisces with
serious intimacy issues.


414
00:16:41.779 --> 00:16:44.814
Please welcome Matt Rogers.

415
00:16:44.883 --> 00:16:46.262
- Hey, Ru.
- Hi, Matt.


416
00:16:46.331 --> 00:16:48.055
- How's it going?
- Great.


417
00:16:48.124 --> 00:16:51.331
Are you ready to snatch
a Snatchelorette?


418
00:16:51.400 --> 00:16:52.745
- Crossing my fingers, Ru.

419
00:16:52.814 --> 00:16:54.814
- You feeling some type
of a tingly connection?


420
00:16:54.883 --> 00:16:57.434
- All the time everywhere.

421
00:16:57.503 --> 00:17:00.193
- All right, Matt,
here's how our game works.


422
00:17:00.262 --> 00:17:04.331
You ask our four celebrities
personal questions,


423
00:17:04.400 --> 00:17:08.158
and they try to win your heart
with their answers.


424
00:17:08.227 --> 00:17:12.779
Now, when the buzzer goes off,
you choose your dream snatch.


425
00:17:12.848 --> 00:17:15.124
All right, Matt, first question.

426
00:17:15.193 --> 00:17:18.021
- Snatchelorette number one,
if you could take me


427
00:17:18.090 --> 00:17:20.331
anywhere in the universe
for our first date,


428
00:17:20.400 --> 00:17:22.676
where would you take me,
and why?


429
00:17:22.745 --> 00:17:26.193
- I would take you out
on my big black ship.


430
00:17:26.262 --> 00:17:28.227
It'll take you around
the six seas, yes.


431
00:17:28.295 --> 00:17:30.090
- I thought it was
the seven seas.


432
00:17:30.158 --> 00:17:32.055
- There's seven seas?

433
00:17:34.090 --> 00:17:35.503
Shit, my peg.

434
00:17:35.572 --> 00:17:38.779
Well, the jig is up.

435
00:17:38.848 --> 00:17:39.848
The jig is up.

436
00:17:39.917 --> 00:17:42.434
You got me. You got me.

437
00:17:42.503 --> 00:17:44.227
Sorry.

438
00:17:44.296 --> 00:17:46.641
- Okay, well,
Snatchelorette number two.


439
00:17:47.883 --> 00:17:49.917
- They say you are what you eat.

440
00:17:49.986 --> 00:17:52.262
So who are you?

441
00:17:52.331 --> 00:17:57.262
- Papi, I am a bombshell
with a tremendo culo.


442
00:18:00.710 --> 00:18:02.917
Tremendo.

443
00:18:02.986 --> 00:18:05.090
- Snatchelorette number three,
same question.


444
00:18:05.158 --> 00:18:06.710
You are what you eat.

445
00:18:06.779 --> 00:18:08.193
I want to know what you are.

446
00:18:08.262 --> 00:18:11.917
- I mean, what you think?

447
00:18:11.986 --> 00:18:13.814
I'm a damn Cheeto.
How about that?


448
00:18:13.883 --> 00:18:14.883
I'm a Cheeto.

449
00:18:14.952 --> 00:18:16.055
- I am okay with Cheetos.

450
00:18:16.124 --> 00:18:17.814
- They're good.

451
00:18:17.883 --> 00:18:18.928
- Snatchelorette number four.

452
00:18:18.952 --> 00:18:19.883
- Hi, Matt Rogers.

453
00:18:19.952 --> 00:18:20.883
- Hey.

454
00:18:20.952 --> 00:18:22.434
- You seem like a homosexual.

455
00:18:23.710 --> 00:18:24.779
It's okay.

456
00:18:24.848 --> 00:18:26.090
We can make it work.

457
00:18:26.158 --> 00:18:28.572
We can lay in bed
and touch fabric swatches.


458
00:18:28.641 --> 00:18:29.883
And gays love me.

459
00:18:29.952 --> 00:18:31.376
- Well, there's a connection
right there.


460
00:18:31.400 --> 00:18:32.676
- Huge.

461
00:18:32.745 --> 00:18:34.469
All right, Snatchelorette
number four,


462
00:18:34.538 --> 00:18:36.814
I'm trying to develop
a foot fetish.


463
00:18:36.883 --> 00:18:40.503
Describe your feet to me
in ways I cannot resist.


464
00:18:40.572 --> 00:18:42.986
- I didn't know
it was gonna be a pop quiz.


465
00:18:43.055 --> 00:18:44.158
Asking me about my feet.

466
00:18:44.227 --> 00:18:45.883
Is Quentin Tarantino
behind that wall?


467
00:18:48.745 --> 00:18:50.331
Well, I'm a busy actress, Ru.

468
00:18:50.400 --> 00:18:53.021
It's a SAG violation
right now being here.


469
00:18:55.090 --> 00:18:57.400
- All right, Snatchelorette
number one, same question.


470
00:18:57.469 --> 00:19:00.021
Describe your feet and please
be irresistible about it.


471
00:19:00.090 --> 00:19:01.607
- Yeah, Mr. Rogers.

472
00:19:01.676 --> 00:19:04.986
I'm gonna describe
my favorite foot to you.


473
00:19:05.055 --> 00:19:06.434
It's round.

474
00:19:06.503 --> 00:19:08.296
It's silver.

475
00:19:08.365 --> 00:19:10.307
And bitch, you'll get
a splinter, let's be honest.


476
00:19:10.331 --> 00:19:13.503
It's a peg leg, baby,
it's a peg leg.


477
00:19:15.883 --> 00:19:17.686
- All right, well,
Snatchelorette number three,


478
00:19:17.710 --> 00:19:19.400
I have a confession to make.

479
00:19:19.469 --> 00:19:20.745
I have great skin.

480
00:19:20.814 --> 00:19:23.124
And that's because I moisturize.

481
00:19:23.193 --> 00:19:26.814
I want to know,
what's your beauty secret?


482
00:19:26.883 --> 00:19:28.641
- Filters.

483
00:19:28.710 --> 00:19:30.296
Ain't nobody
naturally beautiful.


484
00:19:30.365 --> 00:19:33.538
And if you are,
how much you paid your doctor?


485
00:19:35.434 --> 00:19:37.227
- You need a refund
for that joke, bitch.


486
00:19:40.848 --> 00:19:42.100
- Y'all hos better keep it cute,

487
00:19:42.124 --> 00:19:44.469
and I'm not joking, bitch.

488
00:19:44.538 --> 00:19:45.779
- There you go, sis.

489
00:19:45.848 --> 00:19:48.262
- Snatchelorette number two,
same question.


490
00:19:48.331 --> 00:19:51.710
- Every morning I clean my face
with leche, you know,


491
00:19:51.779 --> 00:19:55.124
with milk.

492
00:19:55.193 --> 00:19:57.676
And I'm gonna play
my two maracas for you


493
00:19:57.745 --> 00:19:58.814
right now, Papi.

494
00:20:00.986 --> 00:20:02.296
Beautiful.

495
00:20:02.365 --> 00:20:03.883
- How wonderful.
- You love music?


496
00:20:03.952 --> 00:20:04.883
- I love music.

497
00:20:04.952 --> 00:20:07.848
I love listening to it. Yeah.

498
00:20:07.917 --> 00:20:09.883
Moving on,
Snatchelorette number four,


499
00:20:09.952 --> 00:20:12.883
they say you can tell a lot
about a person's soul


500
00:20:12.952 --> 00:20:15.296
by looking right
directly into their eyes.


501
00:20:15.365 --> 00:20:17.848
Look into Snatchelorette
number three's eyes


502
00:20:17.917 --> 00:20:19.434
and tell me what you see.

503
00:20:19.503 --> 00:20:22.193
- I can tell
she's wearing contacts.


504
00:20:25.193 --> 00:20:27.503
- Bitch, why your lips
look like that?


505
00:20:27.572 --> 00:20:28.745
- They're glossy.

506
00:20:28.814 --> 00:20:30.572
- Look like you kissed
a baboon's ass.


507
00:20:30.641 --> 00:20:31.641
- Thank you.

508
00:20:34.021 --> 00:20:35.469
- All right.

509
00:20:35.538 --> 00:20:37.124
Snatchelorette number two,
look into


510
00:20:37.193 --> 00:20:40.641
Snatchelorette number one's
eyes and tell me what you see.


511
00:20:40.710 --> 00:20:42.331
- Terrible makeup.

512
00:20:44.848 --> 00:20:48.158
- She cross-eyed, I'm sorry.

513
00:20:48.227 --> 00:20:50.262
- Okay, Snatchelorette
number three,


514
00:20:50.331 --> 00:20:52.848
it's tradition
that virgin brides


515
00:20:52.917 --> 00:20:54.986
wear white at their weddings.

516
00:20:55.055 --> 00:20:57.434
I want to know if we got
married, what color would


517
00:20:57.503 --> 00:20:59.572
your wedding dress be, and why?

518
00:20:59.641 --> 00:21:02.365
- Well, depending on
the filter I use that day,


519
00:21:02.434 --> 00:21:03.710
it could change the hue.

520
00:21:03.779 --> 00:21:06.400
So I don't know exactly
if it's giving


521
00:21:06.469 --> 00:21:12.538
peach or yellow or orange.

522
00:21:13.296 --> 00:21:14.779
In my heart,
it's gonna be orange.


523
00:21:14.848 --> 00:21:17.296
So I'm wearing orange
on our wedding day, baby.


524
00:21:17.365 --> 00:21:19.779
- Here, pass this to her
so she can find the joke.


525
00:21:19.848 --> 00:21:21.848
Pass that to her
so she can find the joke.


526
00:21:24.296 --> 00:21:25.928
- Bitch, don't kick me
while I'm down, bitch.


527
00:21:25.952 --> 00:21:27.710
You know this is not
my strong suit.


528
00:21:27.779 --> 00:21:31.193
You're trying to make a joke
happen at my expense.


529
00:21:31.262 --> 00:21:33.021
I'm not here for it.

530
00:21:33.090 --> 00:21:35.227
Exit stage left, little boy.

531
00:21:36.572 --> 00:21:40.572
- That buzzer means
we are out of time.


532
00:21:40.641 --> 00:21:44.193
So, Matt, who do you choose?

533
00:21:44.262 --> 00:21:47.641
Snatchelorette number one,
Snatchelorette number two,


534
00:21:47.710 --> 00:21:49.710
Snatchelorette number three,

535
00:21:49.779 --> 00:21:54.055
or Snatchelorette number four?

536
00:21:54.124 --> 00:21:57.331
- I'm gonna have to go with
Snatchelorette number four.


537
00:21:57.400 --> 00:22:00.917
- Bingo.
- Snatchelorette number four.


538
00:22:00.986 --> 00:22:03.572
Before you meet
your Snatchelorette,


539
00:22:03.641 --> 00:22:05.814
let's meet the three celebrities

540
00:22:05.883 --> 00:22:07.469
you did not choose.

541
00:22:07.538 --> 00:22:08.848
- Awkward.

542
00:22:08.917 --> 00:22:12.572
Say hello
to Blackbeard the pirate.


543
00:22:12.641 --> 00:22:14.365
- Arr.

544
00:22:14.434 --> 00:22:16.124
- It's an honor.

545
00:22:16.193 --> 00:22:19.055
- Polly!

546
00:22:19.124 --> 00:22:20.158
- I think her bird died.

547
00:22:20.227 --> 00:22:21.572
- I think that was Polly.
- Yeah.


548
00:22:21.641 --> 00:22:22.676
- The bird Polly.

549
00:22:22.745 --> 00:22:24.227
I think Polly is done.

550
00:22:24.296 --> 00:22:27.400
All right, let me
introduce you to Iris Chacón.


551
00:22:27.469 --> 00:22:28.400
- Hi.

552
00:22:28.469 --> 00:22:30.090
- How could you miss all this?

553
00:22:31.296 --> 00:22:32.227
- I'm a fool.

554
00:22:32.296 --> 00:22:33.331
You're beautiful.

555
00:22:35.572 --> 00:22:36.572
- All right.

556
00:22:36.607 --> 00:22:39.055
Say hello to Coco Montrese.

557
00:22:39.124 --> 00:22:40.883
- You look like
you got good credit.


558
00:22:40.952 --> 00:22:42.021
- It's okay.

559
00:22:42.090 --> 00:22:43.021
God.

560
00:22:43.090 --> 00:22:45.158
That's a man.

561
00:22:45.227 --> 00:22:49.296
- Okay, Matt, behind that
thin, glittered membrane


562
00:22:49.365 --> 00:22:52.917
beats the heart of
the celebrity you've chosen.


563
00:22:52.986 --> 00:22:59.021
Move that sugar wall and say
hello to Jennifer Coolidge.


564
00:22:59.090 --> 00:23:00.514
- You picked the right girl,
dumbass.


565
00:23:00.538 --> 00:23:01.641
Come on.
- Hey.


566
00:23:01.710 --> 00:23:02.986
How are you?

567
00:23:03.055 --> 00:23:04.952
- So where are you going
on the first date?


568
00:23:05.021 --> 00:23:06.883
I wanted to go shopping.

569
00:23:06.952 --> 00:23:08.090
Come on, let's go.

570
00:23:08.158 --> 00:23:09.307
We could use
your credit card first.


571
00:23:09.331 --> 00:23:10.917
- Let's go.
I do have good credit.


572
00:23:10.986 --> 00:23:12.779
- You two go shopping,

573
00:23:12.848 --> 00:23:15.607
and audience, don't you go away.

574
00:23:15.676 --> 00:23:18.538
More Snatch Game of Love
right after this.


575
00:23:27.124 --> 00:23:30.986
Welcome back
to the Snatch Game of Love.


576
00:23:31.055 --> 00:23:35.538
Let's meet our next batch
of celebrity Snatchelorettes.


577
00:23:35.607 --> 00:23:38.745
First up,
my favorite Golden Girl,


578
00:23:38.814 --> 00:23:40.331
Bea Arthur, is here.

579
00:23:40.400 --> 00:23:41.503
- Hello, Ru.

580
00:23:41.572 --> 00:23:43.262
You're a pal and a confidant.

581
00:23:43.331 --> 00:23:45.021
- Thank you for being a friend.

582
00:23:45.090 --> 00:23:47.434
Now what kind of man
are you looking for?


583
00:23:47.503 --> 00:23:50.296
- If you've got a pulse,
we'll do great.


584
00:23:50.365 --> 00:23:53.021
My pussy's drier
than Grant's tomb.


585
00:23:54.917 --> 00:23:59.848
- Up next, from "Mob Wives,"
it's Renee Graziano.


586
00:23:59.917 --> 00:24:01.572
- Yo, RuPaul.

587
00:24:01.641 --> 00:24:02.779
- How's business?

588
00:24:02.848 --> 00:24:04.607
- Staten Island is booming.

589
00:24:04.676 --> 00:24:06.055
Is it really?

590
00:24:06.124 --> 00:24:07.503
But the Feds don't like that.

591
00:24:07.572 --> 00:24:10.090
- Are the Feds listening in
on this conversation?


592
00:24:10.158 --> 00:24:12.296
- You tell me.
You the one miked.


593
00:24:14.365 --> 00:24:15.434
- Okay.

594
00:24:15.503 --> 00:24:19.538
Up next,
from "Love & Hip Hop Miami,"


595
00:24:19.607 --> 00:24:21.469
Sukihana is here.

596
00:24:21.538 --> 00:24:23.262
- Suki With The Good Coochie.

597
00:24:23.331 --> 00:24:24.676
Okay.

598
00:24:24.745 --> 00:24:26.917
- You shoot in Miami.
- Yeah.


599
00:24:26.986 --> 00:24:28.572
- You live in Atlanta.

600
00:24:28.641 --> 00:24:29.710
- And do.

601
00:24:29.779 --> 00:24:31.503
- Which do you call home?

602
00:24:31.572 --> 00:24:32.572
- Houston.

603
00:24:36.158 --> 00:24:41.090
All right, up next,
she's America's OG sweetheart.


604
00:24:41.158 --> 00:24:43.469
Shirley Temple is here.

605
00:24:43.538 --> 00:24:45.331
Hi, Shirley Temple.

606
00:24:45.400 --> 00:24:47.400
- Well, hello, Ru.

607
00:24:49.193 --> 00:24:52.262
I won the hearts of America
and the world.


608
00:24:52.331 --> 00:24:54.400
- Yes, you did.

609
00:24:54.469 --> 00:24:58.158
Are you ready to win the heart
of a nice Snatchelor?


610
00:24:58.227 --> 00:25:02.952
- Well, I don't know,
does he know how to babysit?


611
00:25:03.021 --> 00:25:04.848
- All right,
time to play the game.


612
00:25:04.917 --> 00:25:09.021
Let's close that sugar wall.

613
00:25:09.090 --> 00:25:11.779
- The Feds, bitch, the Feds.

614
00:25:11.848 --> 00:25:14.365
- Let's meet
our next Snatchelor.


615
00:25:14.434 --> 00:25:18.917
He's a Scorpio who was born
without a gag reflex.


616
00:25:18.986 --> 00:25:21.124
There ought to be
a charity for that.


617
00:25:21.193 --> 00:25:23.848
Please welcome Bowen Yang.

618
00:25:23.917 --> 00:25:24.986
- Hi, Ru.

619
00:25:25.055 --> 00:25:25.986
I'm a medical marvel.

620
00:25:26.055 --> 00:25:29.124
- Yes, you are, my goodness.

621
00:25:29.193 --> 00:25:30.952
Now, I hear
you're looking for love.


622
00:25:31.021 --> 00:25:32.331
- I am, and I'm not that picky.

623
00:25:32.400 --> 00:25:33.572
- Not that picky?
- No.


624
00:25:33.641 --> 00:25:34.952
- Good to know.

625
00:25:35.021 --> 00:25:36.962
I think you've definitely
come to the right place.


626
00:25:36.986 --> 00:25:39.331
First question from Bowen.

627
00:25:39.400 --> 00:25:43.434
- Snatchelorette number one,
I love an outdoorsy gal.


628
00:25:43.503 --> 00:25:46.331
If I took you camping
on our first date, tell me,


629
00:25:46.400 --> 00:25:48.676
how would you make it
super romantic?


630
00:25:48.745 --> 00:25:51.090
- Well, Bowen,
we could start by reading


631
00:25:51.158 --> 00:25:55.745
through the collected works
of William Shakespeare.


632
00:25:55.814 --> 00:25:58.814
And then we might get
a little drunk,


633
00:25:58.883 --> 00:26:03.814
and we'll land in jail.

634
00:26:09.365 --> 00:26:10.848
- That sounds lovely.

635
00:26:12.986 --> 00:26:14.676
- It's a good time.

636
00:26:17.607 --> 00:26:20.331
- Snatchelorette number two,
how would you make camping


637
00:26:20.400 --> 00:26:21.745
super romantic?

638
00:26:21.814 --> 00:26:23.296
- Well, first of all, Bowen,

639
00:26:23.365 --> 00:26:25.607
we not going camping
in Staten Island.


640
00:26:25.676 --> 00:26:27.710
That dump is infested
with rats...


641
00:26:27.779 --> 00:26:29.848
The same rats over here, bitch.

642
00:26:29.917 --> 00:26:31.883
Okay.

643
00:26:31.952 --> 00:26:33.296
Snatchelorette number three.

644
00:26:33.365 --> 00:26:34.365
- Hello, Bo
-Bo.

645
00:26:34.400 --> 00:26:36.986
- Roses are red,
violets are blue,


646
00:26:37.055 --> 00:26:39.952
how do you feel
about open relationships?


647
00:26:40.021 --> 00:26:41.952
- As long as y'all both
open your bank accounts,


648
00:26:42.021 --> 00:26:45.607
we all good in the hood, baby.

649
00:26:45.676 --> 00:26:46.883
- Okay.

650
00:26:46.952 --> 00:26:48.676
Snatchelorette number four,

651
00:26:48.745 --> 00:26:52.090
what song best describes
your love life, and why?


652
00:26:52.158 --> 00:26:54.676
- I would say
"On The Good Ship Lollipop,"


653
00:26:54.745 --> 00:27:00.503
'cause I'm a sweet trip
to the candy shop.


654
00:27:00.572 --> 00:27:02.124
I'm all grown up now.

655
00:27:02.193 --> 00:27:04.090
I'm 100 years old.

656
00:27:07.710 --> 00:27:10.676
- In what, Shirley, dog years?

657
00:27:10.745 --> 00:27:12.434
- You tell me, you're the bitch.

658
00:27:17.124 --> 00:27:19.883
- Snatchelorette number three,
if you were an animal,


659
00:27:19.952 --> 00:27:22.331
what kind of animal
would you be, and why?


660
00:27:22.400 --> 00:27:23.331
- All right, all right.

661
00:27:23.400 --> 00:27:25.331
So I'll be a poodle, okay?

662
00:27:25.400 --> 00:27:28.227
Because this pussy barks,
all right?


663
00:27:28.296 --> 00:27:30.952
- Snatchelorette number two,
what kind of animal


664
00:27:31.021 --> 00:27:33.227
would Snatchelorette
number one be?


665
00:27:33.296 --> 00:27:35.745
- A cockroach,
so I could step on her.


666
00:27:35.814 --> 00:27:36.745
- Ooh.

667
00:27:36.814 --> 00:27:38.227
- I'd like to see her try.

668
00:27:38.296 --> 00:27:40.193
I spent a year at Attica.

669
00:27:40.262 --> 00:27:41.745
Yes, I know it's a men's prison.

670
00:27:41.814 --> 00:27:44.469
I was there a year
before they found out.


671
00:27:46.400 --> 00:27:48.434
- I will gut you like a fish.

672
00:27:50.503 --> 00:27:51.779
- Okay.

673
00:27:51.848 --> 00:27:53.090
Snatchelorette number four,

674
00:27:53.158 --> 00:27:55.607
I'm terrible
at remembering names.


675
00:27:55.676 --> 00:27:57.434
Look at Snatchelorette
number one


676
00:27:57.503 --> 00:28:00.883
and give her a nickname
that I would never forget.


677
00:28:00.952 --> 00:28:04.365
- I call you clam chowder.

678
00:28:04.434 --> 00:28:06.848
'Cause you look stinky.

679
00:28:09.434 --> 00:28:13.538
- I've got the best clam
in Miami.


680
00:28:13.607 --> 00:28:15.572
- Okay,
Snatchelorette number two,


681
00:28:15.641 --> 00:28:17.779
now you look at
Snatchelorette number three.


682
00:28:17.848 --> 00:28:20.952
What should her nickname be?

683
00:28:21.021 --> 00:28:24.331
- A fuckin' whore.

684
00:28:24.400 --> 00:28:25.745
- That is my nickname, honey.

685
00:28:25.814 --> 00:28:28.572
You know me well?

686
00:28:28.641 --> 00:28:30.503
- Is that descriptive enough
for you?


687
00:28:30.572 --> 00:28:31.607
- Yes. Yes.

688
00:28:31.676 --> 00:28:32.952
So specific.
- Yeah.


689
00:28:33.021 --> 00:28:34.469
- Okay.

690
00:28:34.538 --> 00:28:37.538
Snatchelorette number one,
where's the strangest place


691
00:28:37.607 --> 00:28:39.124
you've made whoopee?

692
00:28:39.193 --> 00:28:41.848
- Well, Bowen,
I would probably have to say


693
00:28:41.917 --> 00:28:44.262
in George Peppard's pool house.

694
00:28:48.538 --> 00:28:49.986
- Was George there?

695
00:28:50.055 --> 00:28:53.124
- Well, of course.

696
00:28:53.193 --> 00:28:55.572
- Was the whole A Team there?

697
00:28:55.641 --> 00:28:57.331
- I'm an opportunist.

698
00:28:59.917 --> 00:29:00.917
- That's a yes.

699
00:29:00.986 --> 00:29:02.814
- Thank you.

700
00:29:02.883 --> 00:29:06.090
- Snatchelorette number four,
where's the strangest place


701
00:29:06.158 --> 00:29:07.572
you've made whoopee?

702
00:29:07.641 --> 00:29:10.262
Well, wouldn't you
like to know, you pervert?


703
00:29:10.331 --> 00:29:12.676
Stop hiding behind that wall
and show yourself.


704
00:29:14.814 --> 00:29:19.434
You and your dirty old
questions, you dirty old man.


705
00:29:19.503 --> 00:29:21.676
Look at me, Mommy.

706
00:29:35.296 --> 00:29:36.883
- Isn't she just darling?

707
00:29:36.952 --> 00:29:38.572
- I'm so cute.

708
00:29:38.641 --> 00:29:40.745
Who would believe
I just shit myself?


709
00:29:46.227 --> 00:29:48.331
That buzzer means,

710
00:29:48.400 --> 00:29:50.917
Bowen, it's time for you
to make a decision.


711
00:29:50.986 --> 00:29:53.400
Who snatched your heart?

712
00:29:53.469 --> 00:29:55.503
Is it Snatchelorette number one,

713
00:29:55.572 --> 00:29:58.779
number two, number three,

714
00:29:58.848 --> 00:30:00.745
or number four?

715
00:30:00.814 --> 00:30:02.848
- I might get put
on a registry for it,


716
00:30:02.917 --> 00:30:05.296
but I think
Snatchelorette number four.


717
00:30:05.365 --> 00:30:07.296
My God, we won!

718
00:30:07.365 --> 00:30:09.538
We found a home.

719
00:30:09.607 --> 00:30:11.331
Golly.

720
00:30:11.400 --> 00:30:13.296
- Before you meet
your Snatchelorette,


721
00:30:13.365 --> 00:30:17.572
let's meet the three
celebrities you didn't choose.


722
00:30:17.641 --> 00:30:20.814
Say hello to Beatrice Arthur.

723
00:30:20.883 --> 00:30:24.193
- God will get you for that,
Bowen.


724
00:30:24.262 --> 00:30:25.814
- I'm sorry, ma'am.

725
00:30:27.814 --> 00:30:31.158
- May I please introduce you
to Renee Graziano.


726
00:30:31.227 --> 00:30:32.790
- I'ma catch your ass
in the parking lot.


727
00:30:32.814 --> 00:30:34.952
My God.

728
00:30:35.021 --> 00:30:38.400
- Okay, Bowen, meet Sukihana.

729
00:30:39.745 --> 00:30:41.134
- We wouldn't have
worked out anyway.


730
00:30:41.158 --> 00:30:43.710
My God.

731
00:30:43.779 --> 00:30:47.952
- Okay, Bowen,
only a thin, pink sugar wall


732
00:30:48.021 --> 00:30:51.021
stands between you
and your future.


733
00:30:51.090 --> 00:30:54.503
Move that sugar wall.

734
00:30:54.572 --> 00:30:56.745
Say hello to Shirley Temple.

735
00:30:56.814 --> 00:30:58.848
- Ooh, wowee.

736
00:30:58.917 --> 00:30:59.952
- Wow.

737
00:31:00.021 --> 00:31:02.469
- I didn't think
you'd be so small.


738
00:31:03.641 --> 00:31:05.365
I'm gonna keep you.

739
00:31:05.434 --> 00:31:06.779
- Yay.

740
00:31:06.848 --> 00:31:10.055
- At Snatch Game of Love,
we love a happy ending.


741
00:31:10.124 --> 00:31:13.779
So let's bring back
our other happy couple.


742
00:31:13.848 --> 00:31:16.331
Matt and Jennifer,
come on out here.


743
00:31:16.400 --> 00:31:17.917
Wow, congratulations.

744
00:31:17.986 --> 00:31:19.434
My God.

745
00:31:19.503 --> 00:31:24.848
- Matt and Bowen, before we go,
I have one thing to say.


746
00:31:24.917 --> 00:31:31.641
The time has come for you
to lip synch for your love.


747
00:31:48.090 --> 00:31:49.952
10, 10, 10, 10.

748
00:31:56.538 --> 00:31:58.227
Wonderful.

749
00:31:58.296 --> 00:32:00.158
Good night, everybody.

750
00:32:00.227 --> 00:32:01.779
Good night.

751
00:32:17.676 --> 00:32:18.607
- Out the way, bitch.

752
00:32:18.676 --> 00:32:20.883
- Next, body, body.

753
00:32:20.952 --> 00:32:23.090
Come on in, everybody.

754
00:32:23.158 --> 00:32:26.848
- Did somebody knock this bitch
aside her head?


755
00:32:29.227 --> 00:32:31.193
- All right, Snatch Game
is out of the way.


756
00:32:31.262 --> 00:32:32.503
It's done.

757
00:32:32.572 --> 00:32:33.928
It's the most
nerve-racking challenge


758
00:32:33.952 --> 00:32:34.986
in Drag Race history.

759
00:32:36.710 --> 00:32:38.193
I can breathe again.

760
00:32:38.262 --> 00:32:39.942
- Look at that tap,
tap, tap, tap, tapping.


761
00:32:44.917 --> 00:32:46.158
- Yes!

762
00:32:46.227 --> 00:32:47.434
- For now.

763
00:32:47.503 --> 00:32:48.503
- I had so much fun

764
00:32:48.572 --> 00:32:50.227
just being a little psychopath.

765
00:32:50.296 --> 00:32:52.227
- And it was so much fun
to play together.


766
00:32:52.296 --> 00:32:54.883
We let each other,
like, have our time.


767
00:32:54.952 --> 00:32:57.262
- Girl, I just gotta be real.

768
00:32:57.331 --> 00:33:01.503
After yesterday,
it just, like, really


769
00:33:01.572 --> 00:33:03.710
freaking shook me with Heidi.

770
00:33:03.779 --> 00:33:05.193
Girl, I'm already under the bus.

771
00:33:05.262 --> 00:33:06.997
I don't need you to roll it
and drive on top of me.


772
00:33:07.021 --> 00:33:08.607
Like, that's not
what sisters do.


773
00:33:08.676 --> 00:33:10.055
That's not what family does.

774
00:33:10.124 --> 00:33:13.848
- No, and I also heard
that she went and told Jimbo


775
00:33:13.917 --> 00:33:16.055
that I was coming for her

776
00:33:16.124 --> 00:33:17.404
and she better watch out for me.

777
00:33:17.434 --> 00:33:18.365
I was like...

778
00:33:18.434 --> 00:33:19.572
Gag.

779
00:33:19.641 --> 00:33:21.503
- That's the game
we're playing here?


780
00:33:21.572 --> 00:33:24.676
Listen,
Heidi has spilled some tea,


781
00:33:24.745 --> 00:33:26.503
but it's fake tea.

782
00:33:26.572 --> 00:33:30.158
Jimbo told me that one night
after they cut the camera,


783
00:33:30.227 --> 00:33:33.296
Heidi went up to Jimbo
and whispered in her ear,


784
00:33:33.365 --> 00:33:35.572
"Watch out for Kandy.
She's gunning for you.


785
00:33:35.641 --> 00:33:37.710
She's gonna send you home."

786
00:33:37.779 --> 00:33:39.848
I don't know
what Heidi thinks she heard,


787
00:33:39.917 --> 00:33:42.055
but I did not say that.

788
00:33:42.124 --> 00:33:44.124
If anything, baby,
I am looking out


789
00:33:44.193 --> 00:33:45.779
for both of them
in this competition.


790
00:33:45.848 --> 00:33:49.676
So I'm confused,
and I feel betrayed.


791
00:33:52.158 --> 00:33:54.434
- How do you feel,
Jessica, after yesterday?


792
00:33:54.503 --> 00:33:57.952
- I feel that I started, like,
cute, you know, it was like,


793
00:33:58.021 --> 00:34:00.262
but the joke
sometimes, I don't know.


794
00:34:00.331 --> 00:34:03.745
Sometimes they were there,
sometimes wasn't.


795
00:34:03.814 --> 00:34:05.469
I don't think that
I did terrible,


796
00:34:05.538 --> 00:34:07.503
but I know I can do better.

797
00:34:07.572 --> 00:34:10.158
Well, I hope in
the bottom it's not me.


798
00:34:13.434 --> 00:34:14.594
- How are you doing, Kahanna?

799
00:34:14.641 --> 00:34:15.917
- Back and forth.
- Yeah.


800
00:34:15.986 --> 00:34:17.847
- You know, I was already,
like, feeling


801
00:34:17.917 --> 00:34:19.237
kind of defeated
before I went in.


802
00:34:19.296 --> 00:34:20.503
- I feel you.

803
00:34:20.572 --> 00:34:23.434
- But what really,
like, sent me was you.


804
00:34:23.503 --> 00:34:24.778
- Me?

805
00:34:24.847 --> 00:34:28.778
- Yes, because
you really were pushing me.


806
00:34:28.847 --> 00:34:31.296
Seeing that I was struggling
and, like,


807
00:34:31.365 --> 00:34:33.952
throwing the jokes back at me.

808
00:34:34.021 --> 00:34:36.503
Like, giving me the map
and literally,


809
00:34:36.572 --> 00:34:38.537
like, antagonizing me.

810
00:34:38.606 --> 00:34:40.400
It just was not cute, Heidi.

811
00:34:43.814 --> 00:34:45.917
- I also want to say
I did not mean for that


812
00:34:45.986 --> 00:34:47.503
to be what was happening.

813
00:34:47.572 --> 00:34:50.883
I literally had no idea Kahanna
was having these feelings.


814
00:34:50.952 --> 00:34:52.572
Like, I'm a little hurt,
actually,


815
00:34:52.641 --> 00:34:55.331
that she would think that
I was trying to sabotage her.


816
00:34:57.365 --> 00:35:00.572
I don't want you to feel like
I was trying to push you down.


817
00:35:00.641 --> 00:35:02.681
I was hoping that you would,
like, be able to volley


818
00:35:02.710 --> 00:35:04.158
and, like, hit the joke.

819
00:35:04.227 --> 00:35:05.652
- Girl, I wasn't even
hitting the jokes


820
00:35:05.676 --> 00:35:07.055
that Ru was giving me.

821
00:35:07.124 --> 00:35:09.917
So why are you digging
the hole even deeper for me?


822
00:35:09.986 --> 00:35:11.986
It really, really hurt.

823
00:35:12.055 --> 00:35:13.686
I'm not even gonna sit here
and front with you.


824
00:35:13.710 --> 00:35:15.066
I was really devastated
last night.


825
00:35:15.090 --> 00:35:16.952
- No, I want to be real,
and I appreciate


826
00:35:17.021 --> 00:35:18.848
that you're being real with me.

827
00:35:18.917 --> 00:35:20.503
- Kahanna is going through it.

828
00:35:20.572 --> 00:35:23.952
But girl, Heidi was playing
the Snatch Game


829
00:35:24.021 --> 00:35:25.917
just the way God intended.

830
00:35:25.986 --> 00:35:28.331
- I'm so sorry that that
is how you... how it came off.


831
00:35:28.400 --> 00:35:29.745
I do apologize.

832
00:35:29.814 --> 00:35:32.055
I never want my sisters
to feel like I'm trying


833
00:35:32.124 --> 00:35:34.503
to, like, make them feel
less than or make them...


834
00:35:34.572 --> 00:35:36.193
Push them down
in any sort of way.


835
00:35:36.262 --> 00:35:37.848
Girl, you know that's not me.

836
00:35:37.917 --> 00:35:39.365
That's not what I do.

837
00:35:39.434 --> 00:35:42.262
- Okay, so since we're talking
about family and stuff,


838
00:35:42.331 --> 00:35:44.031
Heidi, why did I hear
that you went to Jimbo


839
00:35:44.055 --> 00:35:45.538
and told her
that I'm coming for her?


840
00:35:48.503 --> 00:35:51.124
- Because you did.

841
00:35:51.193 --> 00:35:53.779
Alexis?
- Ooh.


842
00:35:53.848 --> 00:35:57.055
- Alexis was present
when Kandy was saying


843
00:35:57.124 --> 00:36:00.055
she would send Jimbo home.

844
00:36:00.124 --> 00:36:01.193
- Girl.

845
00:36:01.262 --> 00:36:04.503
- Tell the truth.
Shame the devil.


846
00:36:04.572 --> 00:36:09.883
- I am just trying to, like,
flatline in this conversation.


847
00:36:09.952 --> 00:36:11.779
- Did Kandy say to you that?

848
00:36:11.848 --> 00:36:16.193
- I nodded because
Kandy said that to me.


849
00:36:16.262 --> 00:36:18.538
- I said I'm gunning for her?

850
00:36:21.158 --> 00:36:22.400
- No.

851
00:36:22.469 --> 00:36:23.710
- So then?

852
00:36:23.779 --> 00:36:25.986
- Alexis starts to agree
with what I'm saying,


853
00:36:26.055 --> 00:36:29.917
but as soon as Kandy pipes up,
she's like, "Well,


854
00:36:29.986 --> 00:36:34.262
I don't know if that's exactly
what she had said."


855
00:36:34.331 --> 00:36:35.917
- So which is it?

856
00:36:35.986 --> 00:36:38.503
- What she said was, as soon
as Jimbo lands on the bottom,


857
00:36:38.572 --> 00:36:39.814
I'm gonna send her ass home.

858
00:36:39.883 --> 00:36:41.090
- I didn't hear that from her.

859
00:36:41.158 --> 00:36:43.434
I did not hear Kandy say that.

860
00:36:43.503 --> 00:36:46.331
- I said she is competition.

861
00:36:46.400 --> 00:36:48.296
- That's not true, Kandy.

862
00:36:48.365 --> 00:36:49.814
- Why would you go
behind my back


863
00:36:49.883 --> 00:36:51.331
and throw me under the bus?

864
00:36:51.400 --> 00:36:52.960
- But I did not throw you
under the bus.


865
00:36:53.021 --> 00:36:54.262
- That's what Jimbo said.

866
00:36:54.331 --> 00:36:56.193
- I didn't say
she threw you under the bus.


867
00:36:56.262 --> 00:36:58.848
You let me know that I need
to watch out for Kandy,


868
00:36:58.917 --> 00:37:00.410
because she said
she was coming for you.


869
00:37:00.434 --> 00:37:02.331
And I said, okay.

870
00:37:02.400 --> 00:37:03.883
- Even if that was the case,

871
00:37:03.952 --> 00:37:05.986
ain't we supposed to be sisters?

872
00:37:06.055 --> 00:37:07.262
Where's the loyalty?

873
00:37:07.331 --> 00:37:10.331
- Well, she was
being loyal to me.


874
00:37:10.400 --> 00:37:13.021
- Baby, you were the one trying
to turn the tables


875
00:37:13.090 --> 00:37:15.641
on our alliance member.

876
00:37:15.710 --> 00:37:18.296
And you want to question
my integrity?


877
00:37:18.365 --> 00:37:19.917
Really?

878
00:37:19.986 --> 00:37:23.572
- Can we just chalk this up to
we are all fierce competition?


879
00:37:23.641 --> 00:37:24.848
- But the thing is,

880
00:37:24.917 --> 00:37:27.090
this is a democracy
where we are voting.


881
00:37:27.158 --> 00:37:29.986
And if Jimbo for whatever
reason landed in the top


882
00:37:30.055 --> 00:37:31.272
and I had landed in the bottom,

883
00:37:31.296 --> 00:37:32.479
she would have believed
all that shit


884
00:37:32.503 --> 00:37:33.686
and would have sent my ass home.

885
00:37:33.710 --> 00:37:35.538
That is wild to me.

886
00:37:35.607 --> 00:37:38.814
- At this point, it's
Heidi's word against Kandy's,


887
00:37:38.883 --> 00:37:40.163
and I don't know who to believe.

888
00:37:40.193 --> 00:37:42.883
But being in the middle
of a fight


889
00:37:42.952 --> 00:37:47.193
between two of my good
sisters feels really shitty.


890
00:37:54.710 --> 00:37:55.990
- Can you light a candle,
please?


891
00:37:56.021 --> 00:37:57.365
And burn some fuckin' sage.

892
00:37:57.434 --> 00:37:58.365
- We might need a few.

893
00:37:58.434 --> 00:37:59.469
- Let's burn some wigs.

894
00:37:59.538 --> 00:38:00.676
Fuck the candles.

895
00:38:03.814 --> 00:38:05.986
- The room is just dead silent.

896
00:38:06.055 --> 00:38:09.055
You could hear a rat
piss on cotton, honey.


897
00:38:09.124 --> 00:38:11.848
I feel very alone
and, like, it's just...


898
00:38:11.917 --> 00:38:13.572
It's not sitting right with me.

899
00:38:13.641 --> 00:38:15.193
The feeling, the aura.

900
00:38:15.262 --> 00:38:19.193
Jimbo, what I told you,
that's what I had heard.


901
00:38:19.262 --> 00:38:21.227
And that's all there was to it.

902
00:38:21.296 --> 00:38:22.572
Let's just have fun tonight.

903
00:38:22.641 --> 00:38:26.227
And when it comes down
to voting, vote Heidi.


904
00:38:26.296 --> 00:38:28.193
- No, Heidi. Come on.
- No, no, no.


905
00:38:28.262 --> 00:38:29.641
Absolutely not.

906
00:38:29.710 --> 00:38:31.376
- It's 'cause I do not like
what this has become,


907
00:38:31.400 --> 00:38:32.686
because this has become
really ugly


908
00:38:32.710 --> 00:38:34.538
and really hideous,
and I don't like that.


909
00:38:36.883 --> 00:38:38.607
So have fun or I'm leaving now.

910
00:38:38.676 --> 00:38:40.331
I don't... honestly, no,
we don't even


911
00:38:40.400 --> 00:38:42.055
have to vote tonight.
I love y'all.


912
00:38:42.124 --> 00:38:43.296
- No.
- No, Heidi.


913
00:38:43.365 --> 00:38:44.296
- No.
- I love you.


914
00:38:44.365 --> 00:38:45.296
I can't.
- No.


915
00:38:45.365 --> 00:38:46.365
- I can't.
I cannot.


916
00:38:46.434 --> 00:38:47.779
I love y'all.
- No.


917
00:38:47.848 --> 00:38:48.779
- I love y'all so much.

918
00:38:48.848 --> 00:38:50.124
- Heidi, no.

919
00:38:50.193 --> 00:38:52.090
- What the fuck?

920
00:38:53.193 --> 00:38:55.193
- I'm not going back in there.

921
00:38:58.503 --> 00:39:00.503
- What are you doing?

922
00:39:00.572 --> 00:39:01.917
- Why?

923
00:39:01.986 --> 00:39:04.434
As upset as I am with Heidi,

924
00:39:04.503 --> 00:39:07.055
this has gone way over the hill.

925
00:39:07.124 --> 00:39:10.055
I never even, like, wanted
something like this to happen.


926
00:39:10.124 --> 00:39:12.400
At the end of the day,
she's still my sister,


927
00:39:12.469 --> 00:39:14.572
and I don't want
my sister to go.


928
00:39:14.641 --> 00:39:17.124
- I need my peace and my joy.

929
00:39:17.193 --> 00:39:19.503
I've lost it here.

930
00:39:19.572 --> 00:39:21.745
- You're not gonna regret this
when you go home?


931
00:39:21.814 --> 00:39:25.158
- No, I'm not gonna regret this.

932
00:39:25.227 --> 00:39:27.331
I know I'm not.

933
00:39:27.400 --> 00:39:28.676
I'm pleased with what I showed.

934
00:39:28.745 --> 00:39:31.055
No amount of money, no $200,000,

935
00:39:31.124 --> 00:39:34.158
no $50,000 from the Fame Game
is worth my happiness.


936
00:39:38.227 --> 00:39:40.193
- Girl, what the fuck
just happened?


937
00:39:40.262 --> 00:39:41.952
- I've done
what I came here to do.


938
00:39:42.021 --> 00:39:43.917
I came here to have fun,
show my growth,


939
00:39:43.986 --> 00:39:47.193
and have a kiki, honey,
and I've done all that.


940
00:39:47.262 --> 00:39:48.997
So sometimes you just gotta
take your own destiny


941
00:39:49.021 --> 00:39:50.262
into your own hands.

942
00:39:53.090 --> 00:39:54.710
- So she decided
she's not coming back?


943
00:39:54.779 --> 00:39:55.952
Yeah, she's...

944
00:39:56.021 --> 00:39:57.710
She's gone.

945
00:39:57.779 --> 00:39:58.710
She left.

946
00:39:58.779 --> 00:40:00.365
- Well...

947
00:40:04.331 --> 00:40:09.193
I know that when our lives
have been the darkest...


948
00:40:11.331 --> 00:40:16.365
It's been this thing that we do
that has saved us.


949
00:40:18.538 --> 00:40:20.158
- It's really shocking
that Heidi


950
00:40:20.227 --> 00:40:22.158
gave up on this opportunity.

951
00:40:22.227 --> 00:40:25.434
I'm so bummed, because
we came into this competition


952
00:40:25.503 --> 00:40:27.676
as friends,
and I really envisioned us


953
00:40:27.745 --> 00:40:28.986
being in the finale together.

954
00:40:29.055 --> 00:40:30.952
- That's not how
that was supposed to end.


955
00:40:31.021 --> 00:40:34.676
- After all of this drama,
who do I feel I can trust?


956
00:40:35.814 --> 00:40:37.262
Nobody.

957
00:40:37.331 --> 00:40:39.091
At the end of the day,
this is a competition.


958
00:40:39.124 --> 00:40:41.641
So I really need
to watch my own back


959
00:40:41.710 --> 00:40:43.952
and keep my eye on the prize.

960
00:40:46.848 --> 00:40:50.710
Fuck. Fuck.

961
00:41:09.503 --> 00:41:10.848
- Yes.

962
00:41:10.917 --> 00:41:11.917
- Yeah.

963
00:41:13.572 --> 00:41:16.503
- You better walk
in those razor blades.


964
00:41:16.572 --> 00:41:20.090
- Welcome to the main stage of
"RuPaul's Drag Race All Stars."


965
00:41:20.158 --> 00:41:23.676
Mrs. Michelle Visage,
tell everybody


966
00:41:23.745 --> 00:41:24.917
how you met your husband.

967
00:41:24.986 --> 00:41:26.158
- Picture it.

968
00:41:26.227 --> 00:41:29.021
New York City,

969
00:41:29.090 --> 00:41:33.641
I was in a bikini, and I
asked him to sit on my towel.


970
00:41:34.814 --> 00:41:36.124
I had the story all wrong.

971
00:41:36.193 --> 00:41:38.193
I thought you were in
a bikini on the corner


972
00:41:38.262 --> 00:41:40.538
of 8th Avenue and 42nd Street.

973
00:41:40.607 --> 00:41:42.055
- We'll never know.

974
00:41:43.503 --> 00:41:45.814
- Mrs. Ross Mathews.

975
00:41:45.883 --> 00:41:47.203
Now, how did you meet
your husband?


976
00:41:47.227 --> 00:41:49.193
- It was over breakfast
in Puerto Vallarta.


977
00:41:49.262 --> 00:41:53.158
I remember a teeny Speedo
and a huge burrito.


978
00:41:53.227 --> 00:41:55.503
Wait, no, it wasn't a burrito.

979
00:41:57.469 --> 00:42:01.503
- The adorable Bowen Yang
and Matt Rogers.


980
00:42:01.572 --> 00:42:04.262
Now, are you guys married
in real life?


981
00:42:04.331 --> 00:42:05.848
- Yes, Ru,
but not to each other.


982
00:42:05.917 --> 00:42:08.021
- We both have wives
named Cheryl Anne.


983
00:42:08.090 --> 00:42:09.124
- Hi, Cheryl Anne.

984
00:42:09.193 --> 00:42:10.503
- We'll be home soon.

985
00:42:10.572 --> 00:42:12.676
Poor Cheryl Anne.

986
00:42:14.227 --> 00:42:15.883
Now, this week we
challenged our queens


987
00:42:15.952 --> 00:42:18.607
to make us fall in love
with their


988
00:42:18.676 --> 00:42:20.917
celebrity impersonations.

989
00:42:20.986 --> 00:42:26.503
And tonight on the runway,
category is Ruveal Yourself.


990
00:42:26.572 --> 00:42:32.331
Now, sadly, I want to confirm
that Heidi N Closet has chosen


991
00:42:32.400 --> 00:42:35.296
to remove herself
from the competition


992
00:42:35.365 --> 00:42:39.262
and will not be participating
in the Fame Games.


993
00:42:39.331 --> 00:42:42.400
We wish Heidi nothing but love.

994
00:42:42.469 --> 00:42:44.745
All Stars, start your engines,

995
00:42:44.814 --> 00:42:47.296
and may the best drag queen win.

996
00:42:58.469 --> 00:43:01.331
- Category is Ruveal Yourself.

997
00:43:01.400 --> 00:43:03.883
Up first, Jessica Wild.

998
00:43:03.952 --> 00:43:05.512
- Ooh, someone's going
to her hen party.


999
00:43:06.538 --> 00:43:07.710
- Everybody remember

1000
00:43:07.779 --> 00:43:10.262
Jessica Wild being the chicken.

1001
00:43:10.331 --> 00:43:14.538
Who came first, the chicken
or the egg or Jessica Wild?


1002
00:43:14.607 --> 00:43:16.917
- Good luck,
and don't cluck it up.


1003
00:43:18.400 --> 00:43:21.124
- I love a drag look
with a side of cholesterol.


1004
00:43:21.193 --> 00:43:23.434
- I'm a very sexy chicken.

1005
00:43:23.503 --> 00:43:26.331
Baby, see you at brunch.

1006
00:43:26.400 --> 00:43:27.952
- Well, she's not just easy.

1007
00:43:28.021 --> 00:43:29.227
She's over easy.

1008
00:43:29.296 --> 00:43:30.469
- Hey.

1009
00:43:30.538 --> 00:43:32.641
- All right, girl,
"omelet" you finish.


1010
00:43:36.021 --> 00:43:38.021
- Kahanna Montrese.

1011
00:43:38.090 --> 00:43:42.021
- Okay, seriously, has anyone
seen Big Bird lately?


1012
00:43:42.090 --> 00:43:45.572
- My look on the runway
is showgirl burlesque.


1013
00:43:45.641 --> 00:43:47.814
Sometimes it's just better
to be naked.


1014
00:43:47.883 --> 00:43:50.883
Who needs rhinestones
when you have a beautiful ass?


1015
00:43:50.952 --> 00:43:52.676
- She seems shy.

1016
00:43:52.745 --> 00:43:54.503
- This is why they call it
the Vegas Strip.


1017
00:43:54.572 --> 00:43:55.779
- Okay.

1018
00:43:55.848 --> 00:44:00.848
What happens in Kahanna
stays in Kahanna.


1019
00:44:01.952 --> 00:44:03.021
- This is me.

1020
00:44:03.090 --> 00:44:05.193
I don't need clothes
to be beautiful.


1021
00:44:05.262 --> 00:44:07.779
- First the egg look and now
she's serving crack too.


1022
00:44:10.676 --> 00:44:12.538
- Up next, Jaymes Mansfield.

1023
00:44:13.848 --> 00:44:16.710
- A furry walks amongst us.

1024
00:44:16.779 --> 00:44:18.445
- I am on my way to Sesame
Street in this costume,


1025
00:44:18.469 --> 00:44:19.848
all right?

1026
00:44:19.917 --> 00:44:21.952
I cannot see a goddamn thing
in this thing.


1027
00:44:22.021 --> 00:44:24.572
First off, I reveal me.

1028
00:44:24.641 --> 00:44:27.055
I bet you didn't think this
reveal could get any better.


1029
00:44:27.124 --> 00:44:29.538
- But, wait, there's more.

1030
00:44:29.607 --> 00:44:32.262
- Giving you a little taste
of what I'm all about.


1031
00:44:32.331 --> 00:44:34.055
I am a show.

1032
00:44:34.124 --> 00:44:35.745
Sometimes a strip show.

1033
00:44:35.814 --> 00:44:39.779
- She's a freak in the streets
and a freak in the sheets.


1034
00:44:39.848 --> 00:44:41.503
- That's the best way.

1035
00:44:41.572 --> 00:44:42.710
- Ooh.

1036
00:44:42.779 --> 00:44:44.400
- "bee-hive."
- Careful.


1037
00:44:44.469 --> 00:44:46.479
You're gonna put somebody's
eyes out with those things.


1038
00:44:46.503 --> 00:44:47.607
- Ooh.

1039
00:44:47.676 --> 00:44:50.090
- Her colors are
blush and whore.


1040
00:44:52.262 --> 00:44:54.848
Kandalisa Muse.

1041
00:44:54.917 --> 00:44:57.538
- Baby, I'm ready
to serve you some cookies.


1042
00:44:57.607 --> 00:44:59.848
Look at this bored housewife.

1043
00:44:59.917 --> 00:45:01.641
Leave it to Beaver.

1044
00:45:03.469 --> 00:45:06.021
- I spin, I spin, and I spin.

1045
00:45:06.090 --> 00:45:07.503
- Ooh.

1046
00:45:07.572 --> 00:45:09.090
- Look at me in my red dress.

1047
00:45:09.158 --> 00:45:11.469
Carmen Sandiego realness.

1048
00:45:11.538 --> 00:45:13.227
- Carmen Sandiego lost her hat.

1049
00:45:18.021 --> 00:45:20.124
- It's everything, bitch,
I'm everything.


1050
00:45:20.193 --> 00:45:24.607
- The Real Housewives of
Fredericks of Hollywood.


1051
00:45:24.676 --> 00:45:26.710
- Take that, Judy Jetson.

1052
00:45:26.779 --> 00:45:28.952
- To infinity and be a whore.

1053
00:45:32.296 --> 00:45:33.917
- LaLa Ri.

1054
00:45:33.986 --> 00:45:36.193
Cloaked in mystery.

1055
00:45:36.262 --> 00:45:37.503
- Barney is a woman now.

1056
00:45:37.572 --> 00:45:38.572
Yes.

1057
00:45:40.090 --> 00:45:42.607
- My bodysuit is stoned out
for the gods.


1058
00:45:42.676 --> 00:45:44.917
I have a bow on the back,
because I am the present,


1059
00:45:44.986 --> 00:45:46.262
honey, and the gift.

1060
00:45:46.331 --> 00:45:49.676
- Wrap it and turn it
and tie it with a bow.


1061
00:45:49.745 --> 00:45:50.745
- Look out, Ciara.

1062
00:45:50.814 --> 00:45:52.469
Somebody else got goodies.

1063
00:45:52.538 --> 00:45:53.952
- Yep.

1064
00:45:54.021 --> 00:45:55.400
- Eggplant emoji.

1065
00:45:58.227 --> 00:45:59.503
- Jimbo.

1066
00:46:00.607 --> 00:46:01.848
My God.

1067
00:46:01.917 --> 00:46:03.779
- The judges are gagged.

1068
00:46:03.848 --> 00:46:05.331
Who is this handsome stud?

1069
00:46:05.400 --> 00:46:08.365
- I've been trying to avoid
this guy on Grindr all day.


1070
00:46:10.883 --> 00:46:13.090
- I don't know her from Adam.

1071
00:46:13.158 --> 00:46:16.296
- It's Adam and Steve,
not Adam and Eve.


1072
00:46:16.365 --> 00:46:18.296
- I am living my Eve fantasy.

1073
00:46:18.365 --> 00:46:20.676
I am the only woman,
the original woman


1074
00:46:20.745 --> 00:46:22.124
from the Garden of Eden.

1075
00:46:24.021 --> 00:46:26.193
- And I am ready
to commit a sin.


1076
00:46:26.262 --> 00:46:30.572
- The forbidden fruit
isn't so forbidden anymore.


1077
00:46:30.641 --> 00:46:32.400
- We've looked at Jimbo
from both sides now.


1078
00:46:32.469 --> 00:46:33.745
- Yes.

1079
00:46:33.814 --> 00:46:35.654
- I was wondering what
happened to Kevin Sorbo.


1080
00:46:37.883 --> 00:46:40.227
- What a two-faced bitch.

1081
00:46:42.158 --> 00:46:43.952
- Alexis Michelle.

1082
00:46:44.021 --> 00:46:47.848
- Are you a good witch
or a drag witch?


1083
00:46:47.917 --> 00:46:49.193
- Sure, I'll smell your finger.

1084
00:46:51.469 --> 00:46:53.607
- The inspiration
for this reveal


1085
00:46:53.676 --> 00:46:57.262
comes from my favorite
musical, "Into The Woods."


1086
00:46:58.331 --> 00:46:59.986
My goodness.

1087
00:47:00.055 --> 00:47:01.572
She's beautiful.

1088
00:47:01.641 --> 00:47:03.917
- I'll eat her apples.

1089
00:47:03.986 --> 00:47:08.952
- I feel spooky, I feel
woodsy, I feel fabulous.


1090
00:47:09.021 --> 00:47:11.779
- That old black magic
has me in its spell.


1091
00:47:17.641 --> 00:47:19.745
- Welcome, All Stars.

1092
00:47:19.814 --> 00:47:23.779
Based on your Snatch Game
of Love performances


1093
00:47:23.848 --> 00:47:28.572
and your Ruveal Yourself
runway looks,


1094
00:47:28.641 --> 00:47:33.124
I've made some decisions.

1095
00:47:33.193 --> 00:47:35.434
Kandy Muse,

1096
00:47:35.503 --> 00:47:37.607
LaLa Ri,

1097
00:47:37.676 --> 00:47:39.917
you are both safe.

1098
00:47:42.676 --> 00:47:44.572
You may leave the stage.

1099
00:47:44.641 --> 00:47:45.710
- Bye.

1100
00:47:50.952 --> 00:47:53.296
- Ladies, you represent the tops

1101
00:47:53.365 --> 00:47:55.193
and the bottoms of the week.

1102
00:47:55.262 --> 00:47:57.745
Now it's time
for the judges' critiques.


1103
00:47:57.814 --> 00:48:01.400
First up, Jessica Wild.

1104
00:48:01.469 --> 00:48:03.986
- Snatch Game of Love,
you did the icon


1105
00:48:04.055 --> 00:48:06.055
that is Miss Iris Chacón.

1106
00:48:06.124 --> 00:48:07.331
Your body looked great.

1107
00:48:07.400 --> 00:48:08.676
The hair looked great.

1108
00:48:08.745 --> 00:48:10.710
I thought you embodied her
somewhat.


1109
00:48:10.779 --> 00:48:16.055
But there was so much more to
her that could have been done.


1110
00:48:16.124 --> 00:48:18.952
- I want to talk about your
Ruveal Yourself runway look.


1111
00:48:19.021 --> 00:48:20.917
You look "egg-celent."

1112
00:48:20.986 --> 00:48:23.469
You do.

1113
00:48:23.538 --> 00:48:25.641
- I want to really thank you
for telling


1114
00:48:25.710 --> 00:48:28.365
this important story
of the chicken and the egg.


1115
00:48:28.434 --> 00:48:30.154
And it feels like
you've really taken a side


1116
00:48:30.193 --> 00:48:31.503
that the chicken did come first.

1117
00:48:31.572 --> 00:48:34.227
So thank you for that
conversation starter.


1118
00:48:34.296 --> 00:48:35.917
- Your Iris Chacón
I was so excited for,


1119
00:48:35.986 --> 00:48:37.365
because I'm a big fan of hers.

1120
00:48:37.434 --> 00:48:38.503
I know you are.

1121
00:48:38.572 --> 00:48:39.917
But it just didn't hit the mark.

1122
00:48:39.986 --> 00:48:42.021
We didn't get
your point of view with it.


1123
00:48:42.090 --> 00:48:43.021
What is your...

1124
00:48:43.090 --> 00:48:44.469
- I didn't get it too.

1125
00:48:48.469 --> 00:48:50.469
- Kahanna Montrese.

1126
00:48:50.538 --> 00:48:52.883
Va-va-va-voom.

1127
00:48:52.952 --> 00:48:56.400
- Snatch Game of Love,
you chose your drag mama,


1128
00:48:56.469 --> 00:48:58.745
Drag Race legend Coco Montrese.

1129
00:48:58.814 --> 00:49:00.917
- That's right. I'm back.

1130
00:49:00.986 --> 00:49:04.055
- I think in theory,
the idea was good.


1131
00:49:04.124 --> 00:49:06.848
Where you went wrong
is that it was


1132
00:49:06.917 --> 00:49:09.883
just a bunch of the same thing
over and over again.


1133
00:49:09.952 --> 00:49:11.514
- There's nothing wrong
with playing, like,


1134
00:49:11.538 --> 00:49:13.607
ornery, cranky Coco.

1135
00:49:13.676 --> 00:49:15.676
But it's hard to react
from that place,


1136
00:49:15.745 --> 00:49:17.779
especially when Ru's
throwing you some assists


1137
00:49:17.848 --> 00:49:20.538
or as you're interacting
with the other queens.


1138
00:49:20.607 --> 00:49:23.124
So I think you just had
a hard job to do.


1139
00:49:23.193 --> 00:49:24.641
- It was just flat.

1140
00:49:24.710 --> 00:49:30.710
What's not flat is this
beautiful, ridiculous outfit.


1141
00:49:30.779 --> 00:49:32.158
- Not only is the look
beautiful,


1142
00:49:32.227 --> 00:49:34.952
but your presentation
of it was sexy.


1143
00:49:35.021 --> 00:49:36.193
It was alluring.

1144
00:49:36.262 --> 00:49:38.745
In that regard,
tens across the board.


1145
00:49:38.814 --> 00:49:40.848
- Yeah.
- Thank you, Kahanna.


1146
00:49:40.917 --> 00:49:43.676
- Thank you, Ru.
- Jaymes Mansfield.


1147
00:49:43.745 --> 00:49:45.814
- You know, if I walk this Earth

1148
00:49:45.883 --> 00:49:48.331
and never see
a drag impersonation


1149
00:49:48.400 --> 00:49:50.227
of Jennifer Coolidge again,
I'd be okay.


1150
00:49:51.607 --> 00:49:54.434
- But I thought you did
a wonderful job.


1151
00:49:54.503 --> 00:49:56.917
And you, in my opinion,
saved that first group.


1152
00:49:56.986 --> 00:49:58.666
Tonight on the runway,
this is really cute,


1153
00:49:58.710 --> 00:50:01.641
but the fit on this
is a bit awry.


1154
00:50:01.710 --> 00:50:02.917
- I lost weight.

1155
00:50:02.986 --> 00:50:04.641
I didn't expect that to happen.
- Yay!


1156
00:50:04.710 --> 00:50:06.434
But gotta pin it,
we gotta pull it.


1157
00:50:06.503 --> 00:50:07.755
Because whatever
the situation is,


1158
00:50:07.779 --> 00:50:09.296
you're out here for display.

1159
00:50:09.365 --> 00:50:12.124
And I'm also starting to get
a bit samey from you.


1160
00:50:12.193 --> 00:50:13.893
Give us versatility.
Give us different looks.


1161
00:50:13.917 --> 00:50:15.641
Switch it up.

1162
00:50:15.710 --> 00:50:16.928
- I love it.
Michelle says switch it up.


1163
00:50:16.952 --> 00:50:18.503
Bitch came out as a pink Muppet.

1164
00:50:20.124 --> 00:50:22.021
- I love this runway so much.

1165
00:50:22.090 --> 00:50:24.503
I think we're long overdue
for the yassification


1166
00:50:24.572 --> 00:50:25.641
of Jim Henson.

1167
00:50:27.193 --> 00:50:28.814
You did it perfectly.

1168
00:50:28.883 --> 00:50:31.917
- Up next, Alexis Michelle.

1169
00:50:31.986 --> 00:50:36.641
- Bea Arthur, you would think
it's an easy character to do,


1170
00:50:36.710 --> 00:50:38.124
but it's not.

1171
00:50:38.193 --> 00:50:40.503
- I've got the best clam
in Miami.


1172
00:50:40.572 --> 00:50:42.814
- It was really,
really well done.


1173
00:50:42.883 --> 00:50:44.262
I was so proud of you.

1174
00:50:44.331 --> 00:50:47.193
- Just down to the outfit
that she would either wear


1175
00:50:47.262 --> 00:50:48.814
to a gala or the pharmacy,

1176
00:50:48.883 --> 00:50:50.710
it was perfection.

1177
00:50:50.779 --> 00:50:52.917
- You were so, so good.

1178
00:50:52.986 --> 00:50:54.296
You were really method.

1179
00:50:54.365 --> 00:50:58.814
I mean, it was just marvelous.

1180
00:50:58.883 --> 00:51:02.124
- I really liked your
Ruveal Yourself runway look.


1181
00:51:02.193 --> 00:51:04.641
You went from that
creepy little witch


1182
00:51:04.710 --> 00:51:06.434
to twirl into this
beautiful gown.


1183
00:51:06.503 --> 00:51:08.848
I wish maybe the gown
was a color or something


1184
00:51:08.917 --> 00:51:11.641
so it was a real
juxtaposition from the witch,


1185
00:51:11.710 --> 00:51:13.676
but it's beautiful.

1186
00:51:13.745 --> 00:51:15.503
- Well, thank you, Alexis.

1187
00:51:15.572 --> 00:51:18.365
Up next, Jimbo.

1188
00:51:18.434 --> 00:51:21.503
- Now, I ask this
with the kindness in my heart.


1189
00:51:21.572 --> 00:51:23.883
What the fuck is wrong with you?

1190
00:51:27.572 --> 00:51:33.469
Shirley Temple could not
have been more insane.


1191
00:51:33.538 --> 00:51:36.296
This tap dancing
giant human being.


1192
00:51:36.365 --> 00:51:40.745
It was just wrong
in all the best ways.


1193
00:51:40.814 --> 00:51:44.193
- I feel like with you,
Jimbo, the concept


1194
00:51:44.262 --> 00:51:46.296
matches the quality
which matches the comedy.


1195
00:51:46.365 --> 00:51:49.538
I mean, you bring all three
of those together so well.


1196
00:51:49.607 --> 00:51:50.641
My God.

1197
00:51:50.710 --> 00:51:51.883
Thank you.

1198
00:51:51.952 --> 00:51:53.434
- I actually would go
as far as to say


1199
00:51:53.503 --> 00:51:56.227
that you are the best
physical comedian


1200
00:51:56.296 --> 00:51:58.296
that "Drag Race" has ever seen.

1201
00:51:58.365 --> 00:52:00.641
When you started tap dancing,

1202
00:52:00.710 --> 00:52:02.710
it was the funniest thing
I have seen


1203
00:52:02.779 --> 00:52:04.538
in months, maybe years.

1204
00:52:04.607 --> 00:52:06.986
Just yeah, thanks
for putting on a show.


1205
00:52:07.055 --> 00:52:09.296
My God, thank you
for such beautiful words.


1206
00:52:09.365 --> 00:52:12.676
- Then you come out here
like this on the runway.


1207
00:52:12.745 --> 00:52:17.055
Literally,
whose face is that, Jimbo?


1208
00:52:17.124 --> 00:52:18.055
- It's mine.

1209
00:52:18.124 --> 00:52:19.538
Yeah, I had my face cast.

1210
00:52:19.607 --> 00:52:22.745
- This was just really
next level to us.


1211
00:52:22.814 --> 00:52:25.090
Really next level.

1212
00:52:25.158 --> 00:52:26.158
- Thank you, ladies.

1213
00:52:26.193 --> 00:52:28.055
I think we've heard enough.

1214
00:52:28.124 --> 00:52:31.917
Based on the judges' critiques
I've made some decisions.


1215
00:52:35.710 --> 00:52:39.434
Jimbo, condragulations.

1216
00:52:39.503 --> 00:52:41.641
You are the top All Star
of the week.


1217
00:52:41.710 --> 00:52:43.124
- Yahoo!

1218
00:52:43.193 --> 00:52:45.676
Whoopsie.

1219
00:52:45.745 --> 00:52:47.158
Misfire.

1220
00:52:48.365 --> 00:52:53.365
- You've won a cash prize
of $5,000.


1221
00:52:53.434 --> 00:52:56.262
- Thank you, thank you,
thank you.


1222
00:52:56.331 --> 00:52:58.986
- Jaymes Mansfield,

1223
00:52:59.055 --> 00:53:01.986
Alexis Michelle,

1224
00:53:02.055 --> 00:53:03.883
you are safe.

1225
00:53:05.572 --> 00:53:08.400
Jessica Wild, Kahanna Montrese,

1226
00:53:08.469 --> 00:53:10.090
I'm sorry, my dears,

1227
00:53:10.158 --> 00:53:13.607
but you are the bottom
All Stars of the week.


1228
00:53:13.676 --> 00:53:14.986
Thank you, All Stars.

1229
00:53:15.055 --> 00:53:16.434
You may leave the stage.

1230
00:53:20.296 --> 00:53:25.503
- I'm in the bottom yet again,
and I'm definitely shaken.


1231
00:53:25.572 --> 00:53:30.193
Because based off my track
record, I may be in trouble.


1232
00:53:30.262 --> 00:53:32.572
- This is my first time
in the bottom,


1233
00:53:32.641 --> 00:53:35.331
and I'm scared as "fff."

1234
00:53:35.400 --> 00:53:38.262
I hope the girls are voting
by track record.


1235
00:53:38.331 --> 00:53:40.021
But we never know.

1236
00:53:40.090 --> 00:53:41.745
I'm not safe right now.

1237
00:53:57.917 --> 00:54:00.676
- One of our sisters has
already left us tonight,


1238
00:54:00.745 --> 00:54:03.538
and the thought
of sending someone else home


1239
00:54:03.607 --> 00:54:05.124
is really, really tough.

1240
00:54:06.814 --> 00:54:08.331
I look good.

1241
00:54:08.400 --> 00:54:12.296
- Jessica and Kahanna
both have challenge wins,


1242
00:54:12.365 --> 00:54:14.158
but, you know, at this point,

1243
00:54:14.227 --> 00:54:18.365
there is very little
to no room for error.


1244
00:54:18.434 --> 00:54:22.365
Any little mishap,
that might send you home.


1245
00:54:23.469 --> 00:54:26.883
This sucks, officially.

1246
00:54:28.469 --> 00:54:30.538
- I love you, and I admire you,

1247
00:54:30.607 --> 00:54:33.745
and I'm very proud of you,
sister.


1248
00:54:33.814 --> 00:54:36.262
- I don't want to do this today.

1249
00:54:36.331 --> 00:54:37.469
God.

1250
00:54:39.745 --> 00:54:42.469
In your honor,
I'm gonna steal this.


1251
00:54:50.710 --> 00:54:52.779
- This has been
an emotional week,


1252
00:54:52.848 --> 00:54:56.710
and now I have such
a hard choice to make.


1253
00:54:56.779 --> 00:54:59.021
This is Jessica's first time
in the bottom


1254
00:54:59.090 --> 00:55:03.262
and maybe my only chance
to take her down.


1255
00:55:03.331 --> 00:55:05.193
Kahanna, you are such
an amazing queen,


1256
00:55:05.262 --> 00:55:07.538
but you've had more
chances than most people.


1257
00:55:07.607 --> 00:55:10.262
So maybe it's time to go.

1258
00:55:10.331 --> 00:55:11.641
Silence.

1259
00:55:11.710 --> 00:55:13.710
I have made my decision.

1260
00:55:22.090 --> 00:55:23.331
Welcome back.

1261
00:55:23.400 --> 00:55:26.986
Jimbo, are you ready
to meet your opponent?


1262
00:55:27.055 --> 00:55:28.055
- I hope so.

1263
00:55:29.331 --> 00:55:31.296
- I'm gonna dust them away.

1264
00:55:31.365 --> 00:55:36.883
- It's time to present
this week's lip-sync assassin.


1265
00:55:38.090 --> 00:55:39.090
Wow.

1266
00:55:41.331 --> 00:55:43.745
It's my blushing bride.

1267
00:55:43.814 --> 00:55:48.572
- Ruveal yourself.

1268
00:55:49.434 --> 00:55:50.469
- Kameron?

1269
00:55:50.538 --> 00:55:51.641
- Who is it?

1270
00:55:51.710 --> 00:55:54.710
- This is someone
who came to play.


1271
00:55:59.365 --> 00:56:01.262
- Jasmine Kennedie.

1272
00:56:01.331 --> 00:56:02.917
- Hi, Mama Ru.

1273
00:56:02.986 --> 00:56:03.986
- Come on down.

1274
00:56:04.055 --> 00:56:05.434
- I guess.

1275
00:56:05.503 --> 00:56:09.124
- They got season 14's
Jasmine Kennedie up in here.


1276
00:56:09.193 --> 00:56:10.713
Now, this is
a lip-sync assassin, baby.


1277
00:56:10.745 --> 00:56:11.917
She gonna twirl.

1278
00:56:11.986 --> 00:56:13.607
And I know she on
the Vegas show too.


1279
00:56:13.676 --> 00:56:15.156
So I'm excited to see
what mama gives.


1280
00:56:15.193 --> 00:56:16.400
She looks good.

1281
00:56:16.469 --> 00:56:19.883
- Welcome home, Jasmine.

1282
00:56:19.952 --> 00:56:20.952
- Feels correct.

1283
00:56:23.745 --> 00:56:26.917
- Two queens stand before me.

1284
00:56:26.986 --> 00:56:30.848
Ladies, Jasmine holds
the lipstick of the queen


1285
00:56:30.917 --> 00:56:34.193
that the group has voted
to send home.


1286
00:56:34.262 --> 00:56:39.055
If Jasmine wins the lip sync,
the queen on her lipstick


1287
00:56:39.124 --> 00:56:40.641
gets the chop.

1288
00:56:40.710 --> 00:56:41.641
Jimbo.

1289
00:56:41.710 --> 00:56:42.883
- Yeah.

1290
00:56:42.952 --> 00:56:44.400
- This is your chance
to impress me.


1291
00:56:44.469 --> 00:56:45.400
- Okay.

1292
00:56:45.469 --> 00:56:47.538
- Win $20,000.
- Yeah.


1293
00:56:47.607 --> 00:56:49.952
- And earn the power to give

1294
00:56:50.021 --> 00:56:53.400
one of the bottom queens
the chop.


1295
00:56:55.055 --> 00:56:58.641
The time has come for you
to lip synch


1296
00:56:58.710 --> 00:57:04.503
for your legacy.

1297
00:57:04.572 --> 00:57:10.124
Good luck, and don't fuck it up.

1298
00:58:03.952 --> 00:58:07.503
Jasmine Kennedie,
you better go off bitch.


1299
00:58:49.572 --> 00:58:52.193
- You fucking talented bitch.

1300
00:58:55.158 --> 00:58:57.572
- Ladies, I've made my decision.

1301
00:59:01.296 --> 00:59:02.883
Jasmine Kennedie...

1302
00:59:04.538 --> 00:59:08.124
Condragulations,
you're a winner, baby.


1303
00:59:08.193 --> 00:59:09.686
- Wait, that's the first time
you've said that.


1304
00:59:09.710 --> 00:59:10.824
Can you say it
again one more time?


1305
00:59:10.848 --> 00:59:12.227
- You're a winner, baby.

1306
00:59:12.296 --> 00:59:14.055
Yes!

1307
00:59:14.124 --> 00:59:15.055
I will take it.

1308
00:59:15.124 --> 00:59:16.296
I'll take it.

1309
00:59:16.365 --> 00:59:20.331
- All Stars, this week's $20,000

1310
00:59:20.400 --> 00:59:23.365
will roll over
to next week's tip.


1311
00:59:23.434 --> 00:59:24.883
- Okay.

1312
00:59:24.952 --> 00:59:28.538
- All right, Jimbo, you are
safe to slay another day.


1313
00:59:28.607 --> 00:59:30.365
- Thank you so much.

1314
00:59:30.434 --> 00:59:31.503
Thank you.

1315
00:59:31.572 --> 00:59:33.814
We love you.

1316
00:59:36.055 --> 00:59:38.124
- Will the bottom queens
please step forward?


1317
00:59:44.434 --> 00:59:48.607
Jessica Wild, Kahanna Montrese.

1318
00:59:48.676 --> 00:59:52.779
Whoever gets the chop tonight
will be immediately entered


1319
00:59:52.848 --> 00:59:56.434
into the online Fame Games.

1320
00:59:56.503 --> 01:00:02.158
Now, with great power comes
great responsibility.


1321
01:00:02.227 --> 01:00:05.986
That is why...

1322
01:00:06.055 --> 01:00:08.745
I have made
this difficult decision.


1323
01:00:11.055 --> 01:00:13.090
I will continue to be blonde.

1324
01:00:20.193 --> 01:00:22.848
- You're so brave.

1325
01:00:22.917 --> 01:00:23.952
- Bravery.

1326
01:00:24.021 --> 01:00:26.021
- No one is going home tonight.

1327
01:00:33.021 --> 01:00:34.469
- Thank you.

1328
01:00:34.538 --> 01:00:37.193
Thank you.

1329
01:00:37.262 --> 01:00:39.021
- Yes, yes, honey.

1330
01:00:41.469 --> 01:00:43.193
Thank you.

1331
01:00:43.262 --> 01:00:46.090
My God.

1332
01:00:46.158 --> 01:00:48.676
- Jasmine Kennedie,
we loved having you back.


1333
01:00:48.745 --> 01:00:50.479
Well, thank you
for allowing me to twirl again.


1334
01:00:50.503 --> 01:00:52.090
You're welcome any time.

1335
01:00:52.158 --> 01:00:53.158
- Thank you.

1336
01:00:53.227 --> 01:00:55.331
- Condragulations, All Stars.

1337
01:00:55.400 --> 01:00:57.710
And remember,
if you can't love yourself,


1338
01:00:57.779 --> 01:00:59.514
how in the hell
you gonna love somebody else?


1339
01:00:59.538 --> 01:01:00.745
Can I get an amen up in here?

1340
01:01:00.814 --> 01:01:02.952
- Amen.
- All right.


1341
01:01:03.021 --> 01:01:05.952
Let the music play.

1342
01:01:19.917 --> 01:01:21.077
- Next time on "All Stars"...

1343
01:01:21.124 --> 01:01:22.445
- I thought Heidi
was a real contender.


1344
01:01:22.469 --> 01:01:23.997
- I just hope she didn't
plant seeds here


1345
01:01:24.021 --> 01:01:25.676
in people's heads
that are gonna grow


1346
01:01:25.745 --> 01:01:27.607
as the competition
moves forward.


1347
01:01:27.676 --> 01:01:31.124
- I think it's some lies
probably being told.


1348
01:01:31.193 --> 01:01:32.848
- For this week's
maxi challenge,


1349
01:01:32.917 --> 01:01:35.779
we are staging
the world premiere


1350
01:01:35.848 --> 01:01:39.434
of "Joan,
the Unauthorized Rusical."


1351
01:01:39.503 --> 01:01:40.848
Yes!

1352
01:01:40.917 --> 01:01:42.641
- Well, I don't have
another option, so...


1353
01:01:42.710 --> 01:01:44.238
- What do you mean,
you don't have another option?


1354
01:01:44.262 --> 01:01:45.893
Like, you don't just get
to say, "This is mine,


1355
01:01:45.917 --> 01:01:47.710
and I don't have
another option."


1356
01:01:47.779 --> 01:01:49.090
- I see you, bitch.

1357
01:01:52.641 --> 01:01:54.710
- Not ass, axe.

1358
01:01:54.779 --> 01:01:56.158
- What's wrong with that?

1359
01:01:56.227 --> 01:01:57.848
- This is gonna be a battle.

1360
01:01:57.917 --> 01:02:00.124
- Don't fuck with me, fellas.

1361
01:02:00.193 --> 01:02:03.193
- We are ready to bring
the house down.


1362
01:02:03.262 --> 01:02:07.641
- That Rusical was unbelievable.

1363
01:02:07.710 --> 01:02:10.917
- Ruveal yourself.

1364
01:02:38.493 --> 01:02:40.493
