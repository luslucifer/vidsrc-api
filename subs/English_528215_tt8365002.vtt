2
00:02:17.745 --> 00:02:18.787
Kid!

3
00:02:24.037 --> 00:02:25.162
Move your arse!

4
00:02:42.412 --> 00:02:43.703
In you go. Go on.

5
00:02:50.912 --> 00:02:52.578
Can you give him another chance Mick?

6
00:02:53.662 --> 00:02:55.037
He's got a lot on his plate.

7
00:02:55.703 --> 00:02:56.828
His girl's pregnant.

8
00:03:10.787 --> 00:03:12.620
- See you Monday.
- Aye, see you.


9
00:03:21.453 --> 00:03:23.578
I asked you if this is what you wanted.
I warned you.


10
00:03:23.662 --> 00:03:25.037
- Yeah, you warned me.
- Yeah.


11
00:04:04.412 --> 00:04:07.412
But all the boys have one.
Most of the girls as well.


12
00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:09.287
- Don't twist the knife.
- I'm not!


13
00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:12.578
Do you hit harder if you're wearing white?

14
00:04:12.662 --> 00:04:14.537
I think you probably definitely do.

15
00:04:15.787 --> 00:04:16.870
I doubt it.

16
00:04:17.287 --> 00:04:19.453
You don't know what it feels like
to feel shame.


17
00:04:20.912 --> 00:04:22.287
Come on, pick up the pace.

18
00:04:22.453 --> 00:04:23.453
Real shame!

19
00:04:23.662 --> 00:04:24.662
Hey!

20
00:04:25.162 --> 00:04:26.370
Do you want fajitas tonight?

21
00:04:27.287 --> 00:04:28.828
Real Shame, do you want fajitas tonight?

22
00:04:28.995 --> 00:04:30.370
- You know I do.
- Right.


23
00:04:35.412 --> 00:04:37.828
Maybe your mum and me
will have some wine tonight.


24
00:04:39.912 --> 00:04:41.078
Fuck's sake.

25
00:04:42.078 --> 00:04:43.120
That was your fault.

26
00:04:44.078 --> 00:04:45.912
It's all right, Dad,
they won't make you pay for it.


27
00:04:45.995 --> 00:04:46.912
Shut up.

28
00:04:47.287 --> 00:04:48.745
I've seen it happen before.

29
00:05:25.703 --> 00:05:26.620
How's my boys?

30
00:05:26.703 --> 00:05:27.870
- Fine.
- Fine.


31
00:05:27.995 --> 00:05:29.287
And my man?

32
00:05:30.453 --> 00:05:31.537
Fine.

33
00:05:58.453 --> 00:05:59.620
What's up with you?

34
00:05:59.703 --> 00:06:01.703
I bet I could punch a hole
in this door.


35
00:06:11.078 --> 00:06:12.245
You just get too excited.

36
00:06:13.245 --> 00:06:15.495
I'm going upstairs for a minute.
Nobody come up to our room.


37
00:06:15.578 --> 00:06:16.662
Finnie, that means you.

38
00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:22.203
You'll be okay, just
keep the peas on it.

39
00:06:24.370 --> 00:06:25.537
- Stevie, hold them!
- I am.


40
00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:27.203
- Hold them proper!
- I am!


41
00:06:31.203 --> 00:06:32.120
Stevie, man!

42
00:06:34.078 --> 00:06:35.495
Come on, get out of my way.

43
00:06:51.870 --> 00:06:53.078
Want some?

44
00:06:54.078 --> 00:06:55.453
Come on, I asked you to move.

45
00:06:58.745 --> 00:06:59.620
Wait!

46
00:07:09.953 --> 00:07:10.912
Nice.

47
00:07:11.870 --> 00:07:12.828
Do you think?

48
00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:13.995
Yeah.

49
00:07:15.370 --> 00:07:16.537
I got you something as well.

50
00:07:24.662 --> 00:07:26.078
Did he tell you he got canned?

51
00:07:26.620 --> 00:07:28.578
Told me he had the weekend
to think about it.


52
00:07:30.412 --> 00:07:31.870
What's there to think about?

53
00:07:32.245 --> 00:07:34.120
He doesn't want to work there.
You should see him.


54
00:07:36.287 --> 00:07:37.620
It's embarrassing, Katie.

55
00:07:37.703 --> 00:07:38.578
Open your present.

56
00:07:50.912 --> 00:07:52.078
It's a shirt.

57
00:07:52.745 --> 00:07:53.870
It's a nice shirt.

58
00:07:55.620 --> 00:07:57.703
I thought I wasn't getting to go
to your mum and dad's 40th.


59
00:07:57.828 --> 00:07:59.703
- It's not for that.
- What's it for?


60
00:08:00.620 --> 00:08:01.620
Try it on.

61
00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:05.287
I will after my shower.

62
00:08:06.412 --> 00:08:08.078
Come on, it'll make you feel better
about yourself.


63
00:08:09.828 --> 00:08:10.995
Who told you that, the sales girl?

64
00:08:11.078 --> 00:08:12.745
I bought it online,
there was no sales girl.


65
00:08:12.870 --> 00:08:14.995
Katie, I stink.

66
00:08:15.078 --> 00:08:15.995
I stink too.

67
00:08:16.078 --> 00:08:17.662
Yeah, but not like me.

68
00:08:30.912 --> 00:08:32.162
For fuck's sake, Dad.

69
00:09:15.912 --> 00:09:17.162
Very handsome.

70
00:09:18.578 --> 00:09:19.537
I'll do that.

71
00:09:19.620 --> 00:09:20.495
I don't mind.

72
00:09:20.620 --> 00:09:22.203
It's my night, you go change.

73
00:09:22.787 --> 00:09:23.745
Do you like it?

74
00:09:24.995 --> 00:09:26.203
Yeah, it fits fine.

75
00:09:33.828 --> 00:09:35.328
Katie, I can manage, you go change.

76
00:09:35.453 --> 00:09:36.662
God, your hands are red...

77
00:09:36.870 --> 00:09:38.328
Red as that pepper, look.

78
00:09:42.995 --> 00:09:45.370
Um, Stevie needs a karate suit.

79
00:09:45.620 --> 00:09:46.870
It's not been six weeks.

80
00:09:46.953 --> 00:09:48.162
How long's it been?

81
00:09:48.287 --> 00:09:49.162
Three.

82
00:09:49.245 --> 00:09:50.162
Well he needs one.

83
00:09:50.578 --> 00:09:53.245
It was you said six weeks.
Do you want me to do this onion?


84
00:09:53.328 --> 00:09:55.245
No, I want you to go get changed.

85
00:09:55.828 --> 00:09:56.703
Why?

86
00:09:57.495 --> 00:09:59.620
You're not going to wear that
to eat your fajitas in?


87
00:10:00.078 --> 00:10:01.120
I won't spill.

88
00:10:01.662 --> 00:10:03.037
- Katie...
- What?


89
00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:04.912
- The boys will be coming down in a minute.
- So?


90
00:10:05.037 --> 00:10:07.287
- So, you want them to see you like that?
- Like what?


91
00:10:08.953 --> 00:10:11.120
I just don't see the point in dressing up
to sit about the house.


92
00:10:11.537 --> 00:10:14.745
Well, I want to see what if feels like
before I take the label off. Is that okay?


93
00:10:33.203 --> 00:10:35.370
Dad, you're not very far along are you?

94
00:10:36.912 --> 00:10:38.703
What do you think
of your mum's dress, Stevie?


95
00:10:39.453 --> 00:10:40.870
It's not for me to say.

96
00:10:41.162 --> 00:10:42.370
She's going to change in a minute.

97
00:10:42.453 --> 00:10:44.287
No, she's not going
to change in a minute.

98
00:10:48.745 --> 00:10:50.078
Fuck me, Mum, you look hot.

99
00:10:50.203 --> 00:10:51.495
What did you just say?

100
00:10:53.120 --> 00:10:54.287
Are you two going out?

101
00:10:56.162 --> 00:10:57.537
She can if she wants.

102
00:10:59.703 --> 00:11:00.912
Did you remember the sour cream?

103
00:11:00.995 --> 00:11:02.662
For fuck's sake, why'd you not remind me?

104
00:11:03.037 --> 00:11:05.328
- Too busy going on about your Karate suit.
- Don't blame me.


105
00:11:05.412 --> 00:11:07.203
Do you want to go see if they've got
any at the garage?


106
00:11:07.287 --> 00:11:08.953
- I'll go, I'll go.
- It's fine.


107
00:11:10.412 --> 00:11:11.620
I'm not asking you to go.

108
00:11:11.745 --> 00:11:12.995
Do you need money?

109
00:11:14.037 --> 00:11:15.037
Yeah, give him money.

110
00:11:15.162 --> 00:11:16.370
It's fine, I've got some.

111
00:11:24.578 --> 00:11:25.453
I'd have gone, Katie.

112
00:11:25.537 --> 00:11:26.870
You're cooking, he's got a car.

113
00:11:26.953 --> 00:11:28.787
Does that make him your go-to man now?

114
00:11:32.620 --> 00:11:34.287
- Where are you going?
- To change.


115
00:11:37.745 --> 00:11:39.245
Wear the dress. Katie!

116
00:11:39.662 --> 00:11:40.703
You can wear the dress.

117
00:11:40.828 --> 00:11:42.245
Fuck's sake.

118
00:11:45.162 --> 00:11:46.037
Fuck's sake.

119
00:12:01.953 --> 00:12:04.745
- What can I do, Dad?
- Nothing, I don't need help.


120
00:12:09.912 --> 00:12:11.412
- Stevie.
- What?


121
00:12:14.370 --> 00:12:15.953
Come and help me wrap these fajitas.

122
00:12:48.370 --> 00:12:51.078
Dad, we're coming up with things
for Kid to do with his life.


123
00:12:51.953 --> 00:12:52.870
Oh, yeah?

124
00:12:53.162 --> 00:12:56.370
My suggestions are road-sweeper
and transvestite.


125
00:12:57.078 --> 00:12:58.953
Transvestite's not a job, Stevie.

126
00:12:59.037 --> 00:13:01.328
It is, when they go
and sing in the bars.

127
00:13:01.495 --> 00:13:03.953
Well... So, he could be
a nightclub singer?


128
00:13:05.037 --> 00:13:07.037
Yeah but also a transvestite.

129
00:13:07.120 --> 00:13:09.162
- This is serious.
- I am being serious.


130
00:13:09.245 --> 00:13:11.037
This is serious ideas I'm giving you.

131
00:13:13.578 --> 00:13:15.662
Are you seeing Kelly tonight?

132
00:13:15.745 --> 00:13:17.662
- No, she's working.
- She's always working.


133
00:13:18.162 --> 00:13:20.037
What will she make of you losing your job,
your girl?


134
00:13:20.287 --> 00:13:21.495
He hasn't lost his job.

135
00:13:22.453 --> 00:13:23.412
Jacked it in, then.

136
00:13:26.912 --> 00:13:28.912
Where do you see yourself
in ten years' time?


137
00:13:30.245 --> 00:13:31.495
I can't think that far ahead.

138
00:13:32.287 --> 00:13:34.578
- Well, one year then.
- One year, what?


139
00:13:34.662 --> 00:13:36.828
Well, do you see yourself
at the factory a year from now?


140
00:13:36.953 --> 00:13:38.745
I'd rather stab myself in the fucking eye.

141
00:13:38.828 --> 00:13:39.787
Here, I'll do that for you.

142
00:13:40.245 --> 00:13:42.745
Leave him, I'm trying to get him
to understand something.


143
00:13:42.870 --> 00:13:44.287
Dad's not playing.

144
00:13:44.453 --> 00:13:45.912
Of course I'm playing.

145
00:13:47.453 --> 00:13:48.745
He won't let go!

146
00:13:48.912 --> 00:13:51.537
You don't always get to choose, you know?

147
00:13:52.245 --> 00:13:54.037
- Does your girl like her job?
- Finnie, will you let me...


148
00:13:54.120 --> 00:13:56.245
She happy carrying you
as well as your baby?


149
00:13:57.703 --> 00:13:58.662
Okay, sit down.

150
00:14:01.078 --> 00:14:02.162
Sit down, eat.

151
00:14:04.287 --> 00:14:05.370
I'm not hungry.

152
00:14:05.578 --> 00:14:07.287
Of course you're hungry, sit down.

153
00:14:07.870 --> 00:14:10.245
- I'll get something later.
- Kid!


154
00:14:10.953 --> 00:14:13.537
Go racing. That'll solve everything.

155
00:14:14.120 --> 00:14:16.870
- Let him go, Katie.
- I was speaking to him.


156
00:14:21.203 --> 00:14:22.162
Kid!

157
00:14:35.537 --> 00:14:36.495
Just start.

158
00:14:59.620 --> 00:15:01.537
If anything happens to him tonight,
it's on you.


159
00:15:05.328 --> 00:15:06.453
Come on, Stevie.

160
00:15:17.453 --> 00:15:18.703
Fucking go!

161
00:15:31.828 --> 00:15:32.870
Fucking go.

162
00:16:28.412 --> 00:16:29.412
Cheers.

163
00:16:36.828 --> 00:16:37.870
Did it start?

164
00:16:43.162 --> 00:16:44.037
Aye.

165
00:16:46.912 --> 00:16:48.120
But it just dies.

166
00:16:51.453 --> 00:16:53.287
Kid thinks it's the alternator.

167
00:16:56.120 --> 00:16:57.120
Does he?

168
00:16:58.037 --> 00:16:59.620
Says we'll get one on eBay.

169
00:17:03.995 --> 00:17:06.203
I'm not on eBay.

170
00:17:07.495 --> 00:17:08.370
I am.

171
00:17:24.245 --> 00:17:25.287
Katie, my can.

172
00:17:25.745 --> 00:17:26.703
Move it then.

173
00:17:45.537 --> 00:17:47.912
- Polish boy will see us.
- He's Latvian.


174
00:17:49.745 --> 00:17:51.120
Latvian boy will see us then.

175
00:17:53.745 --> 00:17:55.537
Do you want to
take me in the back?

176
00:17:56.203 --> 00:17:57.162
Katie....

177
00:17:58.453 --> 00:18:00.037
We can just kiss then can't we?

178
00:18:13.328 --> 00:18:14.662
Hey, keep looking at me.

179
00:18:39.037 --> 00:18:40.037
What you doing?

180
00:18:40.370 --> 00:18:41.703
Dad's trying to start the car.

181
00:19:29.495 --> 00:19:30.828
Come and watch the film.

182
00:19:31.537 --> 00:19:33.870
I think I might just listen
to my records for a while, eh?


183
00:22:18.620 --> 00:22:19.787
What you saying, Kid?

184
00:22:20.787 --> 00:22:21.870
Feeling fast?

185
00:22:28.578 --> 00:22:29.828
We need to speak.

186
00:22:30.995 --> 00:22:32.037
Where's Kid?

187
00:22:33.995 --> 00:22:35.037
He's not here.

188
00:22:35.745 --> 00:22:36.745
Where is he?

189
00:22:36.953 --> 00:22:37.912
He's at home.

190
00:22:38.662 --> 00:22:40.203
What are you doing here then?

191
00:22:42.078 --> 00:22:43.078
I was bowling.

192
00:22:43.453 --> 00:22:44.453
No you weren't.

193
00:22:44.703 --> 00:22:45.953
I was thinking about it.

194
00:22:46.078 --> 00:22:47.328
- About bowling?
- Yeah.


195
00:22:51.870 --> 00:22:53.162
You know he dumped me?

196
00:22:55.412 --> 00:22:56.745
When?

197
00:22:56.995 --> 00:22:57.912
Tonight.

198
00:22:58.495 --> 00:22:59.662
On my break.

199
00:23:01.037 --> 00:23:03.453
- Do you want me to take you home?
- No just tell me where he is.


200
00:23:03.537 --> 00:23:05.495
I told you he's at
home, he's in his bed.

201
00:23:14.912 --> 00:23:16.328
This is mine, I'm taking it back.

202
00:23:24.245 --> 00:23:25.787
He never even gave me a reason.

203
00:23:26.828 --> 00:23:28.703
Just said he didn't know
about anything anymore.


204
00:23:29.287 --> 00:23:31.162
- I'll take you home.
- No just let me sit here!


205
00:23:31.287 --> 00:23:34.453
I can't sit here
with that boy goading me.

206
00:23:37.162 --> 00:23:38.453
Want me to tell him to fuck off?

207
00:23:40.912 --> 00:23:43.370
No, just put your seatbelt on
and we'll go round the "flaggie".


208
00:23:57.745 --> 00:23:59.078
How come you've got Kid's car?

209
00:24:00.662 --> 00:24:01.662
Couldn't sleep.

210
00:24:02.995 --> 00:24:05.287
He told me he'd never let
anybody else drive it.


211
00:24:15.037 --> 00:24:16.370
This boy's not letting me go.

212
00:24:18.703 --> 00:24:20.328
He's tailing you to the bypass.

213
00:24:30.453 --> 00:24:32.328
Sure you don't want me to tell him
to fuck off?


214
00:24:34.703 --> 00:24:35.745
Where do you live?

215
00:24:36.453 --> 00:24:37.537
Don't take me home.

216
00:24:37.828 --> 00:24:39.078
I don't want to go home.

217
00:24:43.495 --> 00:24:44.578
Do you want to race him?

218
00:24:49.870 --> 00:24:51.078
Sure...

219
00:24:54.745 --> 00:24:55.912
If you want to.

220
00:24:56.912 --> 00:24:58.370
I just want to get rid of him.

221
00:25:08.328 --> 00:25:09.620
That's cheating!

222
00:25:09.787 --> 00:25:11.328
He's a fucking cheat!

223
00:25:18.453 --> 00:25:20.120
Come on, come on!

224
00:25:59.453 --> 00:26:00.953
Ah! Look!

225
00:26:02.078 --> 00:26:03.495
He's got nothing left.

226
00:26:05.412 --> 00:26:08.245
Get it up you, Ali Sim!

227
00:26:08.495 --> 00:26:11.828
Tell you who else won't like that is Kid.
Kid's never beaten Ali.


228
00:26:11.912 --> 00:26:13.203
- Has he not?
- Nope.


229
00:26:15.078 --> 00:26:17.120
Aw, he's away home to sulk.

230
00:26:51.078 --> 00:26:52.787
No, no rescuing him...

231
00:26:53.078 --> 00:26:55.745
If you rescue him,
you'll be divorced in three months.


232
00:26:56.203 --> 00:26:57.870
That's true, that's a fact...

233
00:27:22.787 --> 00:27:24.870
He's not replied to any of my messages.

234
00:27:27.203 --> 00:27:28.495
Are we finished?

235
00:27:29.162 --> 00:27:30.287
Do you want this baby?

236
00:27:31.078 --> 00:27:32.828
- Do you want me?
- You should let him sleep.


237
00:27:38.870 --> 00:27:40.912
He doesn't know you've got his car,
does he?


238
00:27:41.995 --> 00:27:43.203
You going to tell him?

239
00:27:44.537 --> 00:27:45.412
Maybe.

240
00:27:48.953 --> 00:27:50.120
Why the fuck should I?

241
00:27:55.578 --> 00:27:56.745
Can I drop you somewhere?

242
00:27:59.662 --> 00:28:02.953
Just drop me back at the leisure centre.
I'll see who else is there.


243
00:28:04.495 --> 00:28:06.745
- I should take you home.
- I don't want to go home.


244
00:28:08.870 --> 00:28:10.662
My mum will be
out, and I won't sleep.

245
00:28:11.162 --> 00:28:13.078
I can still hear those bowling balls.

246
00:28:38.703 --> 00:28:40.037
These fucking lights.

247
00:28:57.703 --> 00:29:00.162
My pals usually stay
for a drink after work.


248
00:29:00.245 --> 00:29:02.703
But the noise drives me nuts.

249
00:29:03.620 --> 00:29:05.745
Do you think being pregnant
affects your hearing?


250
00:29:09.120 --> 00:29:11.370
I hadn't thought about
the noise getting to you.


251
00:29:11.703 --> 00:29:12.912
That's not the worst thing.

252
00:29:13.370 --> 00:29:14.745
The worst thing's the shoes.

253
00:29:14.995 --> 00:29:16.412
They make your hands smell.

254
00:29:17.537 --> 00:29:20.078
I bring perfume to work with me
just for my hands.


255
00:29:44.037 --> 00:29:45.370
Do you want to keep going?

256
00:29:47.412 --> 00:29:48.745
Keep driving for a while?

257
00:29:52.620 --> 00:29:54.828
Yeah. Let's keep going.

258
00:30:18.245 --> 00:30:19.745
Do you want to hear some music?

259
00:30:21.912 --> 00:30:23.537
Aye, no,

260
00:30:23.995 --> 00:30:24.870
maybe?

261
00:30:25.745 --> 00:30:27.953
Not if it's about bitches and guns.

262
00:30:28.287 --> 00:30:29.912
I don't listen to that stuff either.

263
00:30:47.203 --> 00:30:48.245
Just wait.

264
00:31:27.453 --> 00:31:30.370

265

00:31:51.287 --> 00:31:54.328

272
00:32:09.453 --> 00:32:10.703
You cold?

273
00:32:11.620 --> 00:32:12.870
Not too bad.

274
00:32:16.120 --> 00:32:17.370
I'm always cold.

275
00:32:17.870 --> 00:32:19.328
Except when I'm in bed.

276
00:32:19.995 --> 00:32:21.578
Then I'm a human radiator.

277
00:32:23.162 --> 00:32:25.953
Kid said he saw a heat shimmer
coming off me one time.


278
00:32:26.662 --> 00:32:27.953
You know a heat shimmer?

279
00:32:28.662 --> 00:32:32.245
Like in a desert, or off a bonfire?

280
00:32:38.745 --> 00:32:40.537
I'm going to shut
up and let you drive.

281
00:32:50.453 --> 00:32:52.245
Will we cut him loose?

282
00:32:53.828 --> 00:32:56.328
I don't want to be responsible
for them getting divorced.


283
00:33:19.912 --> 00:33:22.078
Wanna see if I can
get us another a race?

284
00:33:23.453 --> 00:33:24.953
They still race the breakwater?

285
00:33:26.245 --> 00:33:27.787
I think it's still roped off.

286
00:33:28.620 --> 00:33:29.662
But I'll ask.

287
00:33:53.203 --> 00:33:54.328
What colour is it?

288
00:33:55.328 --> 00:33:56.245
Orange.

289
00:33:58.495 --> 00:33:59.495
Orange?

290
00:34:00.078 --> 00:34:01.037
Maybe red?

291
00:34:02.495 --> 00:34:03.787
I've only seen it at night.

292
00:34:09.120 --> 00:34:10.120
They're not here.

293
00:34:23.078 --> 00:34:24.245
Can we stop for chips?

294
00:34:27.370 --> 00:34:28.662
I've not had any supper.

295
00:34:30.953 --> 00:34:32.412
I won't eat them in the car.

296
00:34:44.578 --> 00:34:45.620
You want anything?

297
00:34:46.203 --> 00:34:47.495
I already ate.

298
00:34:48.578 --> 00:34:49.912
Are you going to drive away?

299
00:34:51.578 --> 00:34:52.912
I'll just go round the harbour.

300
00:34:54.370 --> 00:34:55.787
Will you come back?

301
00:34:57.412 --> 00:34:58.828
Yeah, I'll come back.

302
00:35:56.037 --> 00:35:57.578
- They texted me.
- What did they say?


303
00:35:57.703 --> 00:35:58.995
Said to wait by the containers.

304
00:35:59.328 --> 00:36:01.037
- Did you get your chips?
- No, it's okay.


305
00:36:01.328 --> 00:36:03.537
Do you want me to drop you back
at the leisure centre?


306
00:36:03.703 --> 00:36:05.578
No, they don't know you, you need me!

307
00:36:53.828 --> 00:36:54.995
Suppose we just wait?

308
00:36:57.662 --> 00:36:58.662
They're at a party.

309
00:37:00.287 --> 00:37:01.162
A party?

310
00:37:03.037 --> 00:37:03.912
Aye.

311
00:37:04.995 --> 00:37:06.162
But she said they'd be down.

312
00:37:17.287 --> 00:37:18.412
Do you have a cigarette?

313
00:37:20.703 --> 00:37:21.578
No.

314
00:37:22.870 --> 00:37:23.745
What?

315
00:37:25.328 --> 00:37:26.995
You think I should keep this baby now?

316
00:37:28.995 --> 00:37:31.287
- Don't ask me, Kelly.
- But I am asking you.


317
00:37:32.662 --> 00:37:34.037
You should speak to him.

318
00:37:48.995 --> 00:37:50.245
Show me where you race, then.

319
00:37:50.745 --> 00:37:51.953
You're looking at it.

320
00:37:53.828 --> 00:37:55.078
Just up and back?

321
00:37:57.412 --> 00:37:58.495
Just up and back.

322
00:38:01.953 --> 00:38:02.870
Show me.

323
00:38:04.495 --> 00:38:06.120
Hey.

324
00:38:06.203 --> 00:38:07.162
Here.

325
00:38:22.828 --> 00:38:24.328
Are you going to kill us?

326
00:38:26.287 --> 00:38:27.162
No.

327
00:38:27.245 --> 00:38:29.620
By accident,
are you going to kill us?


328
00:38:32.787 --> 00:38:33.703
No.

329
00:38:35.703 --> 00:38:37.537
I don't believe you can race here.

330
00:38:37.662 --> 00:38:39.287
I thought you'd done this before.

331
00:38:39.537 --> 00:38:41.037
Nope, first time.

332
00:38:43.745 --> 00:38:44.745
Are you scared?

333
00:38:48.828 --> 00:38:50.745
If he knew we were down here together...

334
00:39:19.328 --> 00:39:20.745
Imagine going down in that.

335
00:39:22.037 --> 00:39:23.370
There's worse ways to go.

336
00:39:24.328 --> 00:39:25.287
Like what?

337
00:39:27.037 --> 00:39:27.995
Anything slow.

338
00:39:33.953 --> 00:39:35.328
Town looks pretty from here.

339
00:39:47.495 --> 00:39:48.662
Kelly, don't.

340
00:39:48.745 --> 00:39:50.953
- I won't send it to anyone.
- Don't take my picture.


341
00:39:51.037 --> 00:39:53.203
- Although can you imagine?
- Kelly don't, it's not funny.


342
00:39:53.287 --> 00:39:55.328
- Stay there and I'll get his car in.
- It's not funny!


343
00:39:56.453 --> 00:39:58.370
What if I want him to know you're
here with me?


344
00:39:58.537 --> 00:39:59.995
Give me that phone!

345
00:40:02.662 --> 00:40:04.662
Do you want me
to throw it in the water, eh?


346
00:40:08.037 --> 00:40:09.037
Fuck me.

347
00:40:10.953 --> 00:40:12.453
You're the double of him just now.

348
00:40:15.578 --> 00:40:17.745
Throw it in, I don't care.

349
00:40:27.703 --> 00:40:30.787
- Kelly, put it in your pocket.
- Did you make sure I didn't take one?


350
00:40:32.037 --> 00:40:33.370
Go ahead, check.

351
00:40:34.953 --> 00:40:38.953
But you might see some of me I sent to Kid
on Valentine's. Parts of me, anyway.


352
00:41:12.495 --> 00:41:13.495
Cheers.

353
00:41:36.078 --> 00:41:38.662
How can someone love one you day
and not love you the next?


354
00:41:42.245 --> 00:41:44.412
Every person I've ever loved I still love.

355
00:41:46.787 --> 00:41:47.745
I'm like a dog.

356
00:42:06.870 --> 00:42:08.870
- All right!
- No, it's not all right!


357
00:42:25.620 --> 00:42:27.703
Fuck this, what do we need them
for anyway?


358
00:42:27.953 --> 00:42:30.203
- Where we going?
- Going to race this fucking wall.


359
00:42:30.453 --> 00:42:31.995
- What, just us?
- Yeah.


360
00:42:32.495 --> 00:42:33.828
- You ready?
- Wait.


361
00:42:40.828 --> 00:42:41.828
You need to say it.

362
00:42:48.245 --> 00:42:49.162
Go.

363
00:43:57.078 --> 00:43:57.995
Is that it?

364
00:44:00.620 --> 00:44:02.787
Do you want me to go again?
I can do it faster.


365
00:44:38.203 --> 00:44:40.120
- You okay?
- I need to move.


366
00:44:40.912 --> 00:44:43.162
- I need to get my temperature up.
- Get back in the car then.


367
00:44:43.245 --> 00:44:44.453
No, I need to move.

368
00:44:44.662 --> 00:44:45.912
I want to dance.

369
00:44:46.203 --> 00:44:47.745
Will you come to Deejays with me?

370
00:44:48.078 --> 00:44:49.620
- Deejays?
- Yeah.


371
00:44:50.328 --> 00:44:51.203
We'll still get in.

372
00:44:51.370 --> 00:44:53.662
- You go if you want.
- Will you come with me?


373
00:44:53.995 --> 00:44:55.537
I'll take you if that's what you want.

374
00:44:55.870 --> 00:44:57.328
But will you come in with me?

375
00:44:58.787 --> 00:44:59.828
No, Kelly.

376
00:45:02.037 --> 00:45:03.203
Forget it then.

377
00:45:04.620 --> 00:45:06.620
- I thought you wanted to dance?
- Not by myself.


378
00:45:08.287 --> 00:45:10.203
Do you want me to take you up there
or not?


379
00:45:10.787 --> 00:45:13.495
You can't just drop me there and then
go home like I never existed.


380
00:45:16.578 --> 00:45:18.370
I never said I was going home.

381
00:45:32.495 --> 00:45:33.828
So where do you want to go?

382
00:45:37.287 --> 00:45:38.495
I want to get out of here.

383
00:45:41.120 --> 00:45:42.078
I'll go with you.

384
00:45:49.870 --> 00:45:51.787
- Do you understand what I'm saying?
- Yeah.


385
00:45:52.870 --> 00:45:54.828
- You want to leave the town.
- Tonight.


386
00:45:54.953 --> 00:45:56.037
Tonight.

387
00:45:58.912 --> 00:46:00.203
And not come back, Kelly.

388
00:46:01.995 --> 00:46:02.912
I get it.

389
00:46:04.620 --> 00:46:05.495
Let's go.

390
00:47:45.370 --> 00:47:46.912
I've only been away with the school.

391
00:47:49.495 --> 00:47:50.703
Do you want to back out?

392
00:47:53.037 --> 00:47:54.328
Do you want to back out?

393
00:47:56.328 --> 00:47:57.662
I said I was coming with you.

394
00:47:58.620 --> 00:47:59.620
Okay.

395
00:48:03.495 --> 00:48:04.662
Here, this is my house.

396
00:48:12.870 --> 00:48:14.328
I'll just go in for a minute.

397
00:48:14.745 --> 00:48:17.870
I'm thinking what I need to bring. Where
we going, in case I want to leave a note?


398
00:48:18.578 --> 00:48:20.245
Just say you'll call tomorrow
or the next day.


399
00:48:20.328 --> 00:48:22.537
- Is that how long it'll take to get there?
- There's no "there".


400
00:48:22.620 --> 00:48:23.578
Okay, sorry.

401
00:48:26.203 --> 00:48:28.370
We're just going to keep driving till
we find some place we like


402
00:48:28.453 --> 00:48:30.037
and then we'll move on again
once we're bored.


403
00:48:31.203 --> 00:48:33.328
I'll pick up work from place to place,
just depends what I find.


404
00:48:34.078 --> 00:48:34.995
I'll work too.

405
00:48:36.370 --> 00:48:38.120
I was thinking maybe seasonal work for me.

406
00:48:38.912 --> 00:48:40.578
I can work outside
so long as I'm warm.

407
00:48:40.870 --> 00:48:42.203
But that's the kind of thing
I need to know,


408
00:48:42.287 --> 00:48:43.703
because it helps with
my packing decisions.


409
00:48:43.953 --> 00:48:45.453
I don't want to be up there deciding
for long.


410
00:48:45.537 --> 00:48:46.578
We can buy stuff.

411
00:48:46.662 --> 00:48:48.745
But there's no point wasting money,
I'm just being practical.


412
00:48:48.828 --> 00:48:50.620
- Practical's good.
- I'll be the practical one then.


413
00:48:51.787 --> 00:48:53.912
And you can teach me to drive?

414
00:48:55.453 --> 00:48:56.495
Yeah, sure.

415
00:48:58.662 --> 00:49:04.162
But listen, if we find some place you like
and you want to stay, but I don't...


416
00:49:05.287 --> 00:49:06.620
That's okay too, right?

417
00:49:07.370 --> 00:49:08.453
Yeah, that's okay.

418
00:49:10.037 --> 00:49:11.162
No strings attached.

419
00:49:12.995 --> 00:49:13.953
Exactly.

420
00:49:22.287 --> 00:49:23.745
I'll just be a few minutes then.

421
00:54:52.828 --> 00:54:53.870
Where'd you go?

422
00:54:57.287 --> 00:54:58.370
Nowhere.

423
00:55:12.370 --> 00:55:14.120
We didn't run very far, did we?

424
00:55:15.995 --> 00:55:16.870
Guess not.

425
00:55:19.953 --> 00:55:21.162
I'm getting mine removed.

426
00:55:24.787 --> 00:55:25.828
Where'd you go?

427
00:55:28.120 --> 00:55:29.912
I took Kid's car for a drive.

428
00:55:30.120 --> 00:55:31.120
I know that.

429
00:55:33.412 --> 00:55:34.412
Does he?

430
00:55:35.620 --> 00:55:36.745
What do you think?

431
00:55:38.662 --> 00:55:40.037
So, you angry at me?

432
00:55:43.537 --> 00:55:44.745
I'd have gone with you.

433
00:55:47.662 --> 00:55:48.745
If you'd asked.

434
00:55:51.537 --> 00:55:53.162
Would you really have come with me?

435
00:55:56.787 --> 00:55:58.495
I should go to bed.
I've got work in the morning.


436
00:56:07.620 --> 00:56:09.870
Do you remember when
we raced the breakwater?


437
00:56:11.620 --> 00:56:12.787
Is that where you went?

438
00:56:16.037 --> 00:56:17.203
Do you remember after?

439
00:56:19.245 --> 00:56:20.245
I remember.

440
00:56:22.703 --> 00:56:23.870
What do you remember?

441
00:56:27.578 --> 00:56:29.412
- I remember being cold.
- Mm.


442
00:56:32.037 --> 00:56:33.828
- And drunk.
- Mm.


443
00:56:37.537 --> 00:56:38.537
And arrogant.

444
00:56:42.037 --> 00:56:43.412
We weren't arrogant.

445
00:56:44.912 --> 00:56:47.037
You were the most arrogant boy
I'd ever met.


446
00:56:48.578 --> 00:56:49.578
That tickles.

447
00:56:55.120 --> 00:56:56.620
Tell me what you liked about me.

448
00:56:57.745 --> 00:56:59.328
I can tell you what
I like about you now.

449
00:57:10.537 --> 00:57:12.453
I'm sick of
looking at these boxes.


450
00:57:14.578 --> 00:57:15.828
I'm going to bed.

451
00:57:16.453 --> 00:57:18.037
- Do you hear me?
- I hear you.


452
00:57:19.787 --> 00:57:21.537
Well we need to put them somewhere.

453
00:57:21.870 --> 00:57:23.245
We did, we put them here.

454
00:57:23.578 --> 00:57:25.495
Well I don't want
to look at them anymore.

455
00:57:25.578 --> 00:57:27.620
Okay, we'll move them, I don't know where
but we'll move them.


456
00:57:27.703 --> 00:57:28.953
Fuck that, I'll chuck them out.

457
00:57:29.787 --> 00:57:31.787
I don't care what's in them,
it's all worthless.


458
00:57:33.245 --> 00:57:35.203
Do you want to do it now?
Come on, we'll do it now.


459
00:57:49.870 --> 00:57:51.120
You'll wake the boys.

460
00:57:51.203 --> 00:57:53.370
That's alright, they can go
in a bag as well.


461
00:57:58.578 --> 00:58:00.078
Wanna see if I fit in one?

462
00:58:03.953 --> 00:58:05.245
Maybe one for my head?

463
00:58:09.370 --> 00:58:11.370
I've run out of ways to help you.

464
00:58:12.203 --> 00:58:13.203
You'll suffocate.

465
00:58:14.078 --> 00:58:15.287
And you'll watch me.

466
00:58:19.578 --> 00:58:21.578
Stop trying to help me!

467
00:58:21.787 --> 00:58:23.120
I'm not wanting your help.

468
00:58:23.203 --> 00:58:24.703
Good, because you're not
getting it anymore.


469
00:58:24.787 --> 00:58:26.495
- I should be helping you.
- So help me then.


470
00:58:26.912 --> 00:58:27.870
Be a man!

471
00:58:28.162 --> 00:58:29.787
Come on, fucking help me!

472
00:59:04.828 --> 00:59:07.162
I remember you used to ask me
to run away with you.


473
00:59:12.745 --> 00:59:13.953
Leave town together.

474
00:59:20.828 --> 00:59:21.745
Yeah.

475
00:59:25.662 --> 00:59:26.995
But you wouldn't come.

476
00:59:29.995 --> 00:59:31.370
It was never about that for me.

477
00:59:35.703 --> 00:59:37.620
I just thought it was another way
to say I love you.


478
01:00:02.287 --> 01:00:03.287
Go then.

479
01:00:07.495 --> 01:00:08.662
Nobody's stopping you.

480
01:00:59.287 --> 01:01:00.370
What you looking for?

481
01:01:00.995 --> 01:01:02.120
Little red screwdriver.

482
01:01:03.078 --> 01:01:04.162
What for?

483
01:01:04.495 --> 01:01:05.495
Table leg.

484
01:01:10.828 --> 01:01:11.912
What happened to it?

485
01:01:12.953 --> 01:01:13.870
It just collapsed.

486
01:01:14.120 --> 01:01:15.620
Did it fuck just collapse.

487
01:01:18.745 --> 01:01:20.370
- Did you kick it?
- No.


488
01:01:20.495 --> 01:01:21.828
Did you kick this leg out?

489
01:01:23.870 --> 01:01:26.370
- Might have caught it with my foot.
- You fucking might have.


490
01:01:36.328 --> 01:01:38.662
- There's no screwdrivers in there.
- So where is it then?


491
01:01:40.037 --> 01:01:41.037
It's in the garage.

492
01:01:45.412 --> 01:01:46.745
What happened to all those boxes?

493
01:01:50.870 --> 01:01:51.995
They just collapsed.

494
01:02:13.662 --> 01:02:16.245
Dad, there's no toilet roll!

495
01:03:00.078 --> 01:03:01.912
- You got any plans today?
- No.


496
01:03:06.870 --> 01:03:08.203
You seeing Kelly?

497
01:03:10.453 --> 01:03:11.745
Don't think so.

498
01:03:16.037 --> 01:03:17.287
Is she working or...?

499
01:03:20.953 --> 01:03:22.245
She's not speaking to me.

500
01:03:27.662 --> 01:03:29.037
Why's she not speaking to you?

501
01:03:30.787 --> 01:03:32.662
Because I fucked up the relationship,
all right?


502
01:03:34.578 --> 01:03:35.662
You happy now?

503
01:03:38.703 --> 01:03:39.578
No.

504
01:03:45.537 --> 01:03:46.495
Aye, you are.

505
01:03:54.162 --> 01:03:56.495
- I need to tell you something.
- I don't want to hear it, Dad.


506
01:04:01.370 --> 01:04:02.620
Will you just give me a minute?

507
01:04:03.662 --> 01:04:04.995
I'm not interested, Dad.

508
01:04:05.953 --> 01:04:07.912
I mean, you act like
it's the only job in town.


509
01:04:08.412 --> 01:04:09.370
And it's not.

510
01:04:11.495 --> 01:04:12.578
Where you going?

511
01:04:13.120 --> 01:04:13.995
Nowhere.

512
01:04:41.287 --> 01:04:42.287
Bye, Dad.

513
01:04:42.953 --> 01:04:43.870
Bye, Stevie.

514
01:04:44.870 --> 01:04:45.995
Uh, Stevie!

515
01:04:47.620 --> 01:04:48.620
What?

516
01:04:49.745 --> 01:04:52.495
- Are you wanting any breakfast?
- I need to go.


517
01:04:53.578 --> 01:04:56.537
- Waffles or something?
- Can I have them when I get back?


518
01:04:58.745 --> 01:04:59.953
Yeah, go to football.

519
01:05:05.578 --> 01:05:06.495
Steve...

520
01:05:47.578 --> 01:05:48.953
Were you in my car last night?

521
01:05:51.828 --> 01:05:52.870
Yeah, I was.

522
01:05:55.078 --> 01:05:56.037
With Kelly?

523
01:05:57.203 --> 01:05:58.828
She was looking for you, Kid.

524
01:07:54.995 --> 01:07:56.245
Why'd you do it?

525
01:07:58.120 --> 01:07:59.203
Take my car out.

526
01:08:01.078 --> 01:08:03.245
I don't know, why do you do it?

527
01:08:06.995 --> 01:08:07.995
Speak about me?

528
01:08:12.412 --> 01:08:13.787
That girl loves you.

529
01:08:14.870 --> 01:08:17.245
She loved me a month ago when
I told you she was pregnant.


530
01:08:21.578 --> 01:08:23.328
Am I not allowed
to have what you have?

531
01:08:25.537 --> 01:08:27.745
You can go anywhere you want.

532
01:08:28.037 --> 01:08:28.912
Go where?

533
01:08:29.995 --> 01:08:30.995
Do anything.

534
01:08:31.537 --> 01:08:32.537
And do what?

535
01:08:33.328 --> 01:08:34.912
Something, anything.

536
01:08:37.453 --> 01:08:39.787
Instead of nothing, which is what I do.

537
01:08:42.537 --> 01:08:43.662
Which is what I am.

538
01:08:52.537 --> 01:08:53.703
So are we nothing?

539
01:08:54.745 --> 01:08:55.828
Is Mum nothing?

540
01:08:56.578 --> 01:08:57.453
No.

541
01:08:59.495 --> 01:09:00.578
Neither's Kelly.

542
01:09:06.995 --> 01:09:08.037
She's something.

543
01:09:27.703 --> 01:09:29.120
Is Mum needing picked up?

544
01:09:41.412 --> 01:09:42.495
She never said.

545
01:10:03.703 --> 01:10:06.245
I don't want to talk to you.

546
01:11:14.245 --> 01:11:16.037
You just missed her.

547
01:12:53.301 --> 01:12:56.332
