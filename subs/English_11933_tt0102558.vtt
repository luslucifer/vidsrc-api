Russian immigrant.

Somebody throwing a party?

34
00:02:18.728 --> 00:02:19.849
- You are, sir.
- Oh, yeah?


35
00:02:19.879 --> 00:02:20.940
Am I having a good time?

36
00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:23.132
Well, Manhattan Fine Wines
just delivered


37
00:02:23.162 --> 00:02:25.375
six cases
of Salon Les Mesnil.


38
00:02:25.585 --> 00:02:27.066
Wow,
pretty pricey stuff.


39
00:02:27.096 --> 00:02:29.048
- What did I pay for it?
- What do you care?


40
00:02:29.078 --> 00:02:30.600
You got more money
than you can even look at.

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:32.221
Oh, I'd like
to thank you

on the market you gave me.

gone up five points.

- Want some more advice?
- Sure.


46
00:02:38.067 --> 00:02:39.068
Sell it.

Chris, look!
It's us!

00:03:02.191 --> 00:03:04.854

- Hi, Chris.


55
00:03:04.884 --> 00:03:06.506
I save it for you.

56
00:03:06.536 --> 00:03:08.598
And that's what she says
to all the guys.


57

Go ahead.

Chris, we'll see you
in the apartment.


60
00:03:22.532 --> 00:03:24.474
- Oop!
- Oh, I'm sorry, sir.


61
00:03:24.504 --> 00:03:26.135
Heya, little fella.
What's your name?


62
00:03:26.165 --> 00:03:27.186
Get down! Get down!

63
00:03:27.216 --> 00:03:28.818
Come on, girls.
Get over here.


64
00:03:29.879 --> 00:03:31.330
- I'm sorry.
- You oughta get cats.


65
00:03:31.361 --> 00:03:32.742
They're a lower-maintenance pet.

66
00:03:34.954 --> 00:03:35.765
Ah, here we go.

67
00:03:35.785 --> 00:03:38.237
Come on, let's go.
Come on, girls.


68
00:03:38.267 --> 00:03:40.169
Chris!
Chris!


69
00:03:44.434 --> 00:03:45.765
I hate crowds.

70
00:03:48.037 --> 00:03:49.328
You new
in the building?


71
00:03:52.822 --> 00:03:53.873
You all right?

72
00:03:54.343 --> 00:03:55.655
Y
-Yes.

73
00:03:56.476 --> 00:03:57.487
Take this.

74
00:04:01.861 --> 00:04:04.434
- I-I'm sorry.
- It's okay.


75
00:04:05.024 --> 00:04:06.526
I never do this.

76
00:04:08.147 --> 00:04:11.070
Listen, some people are throwing
a party up at my apartment.


77
00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:13.353
Why don't you come up for a drink?
It'll help you relax.


78
00:04:19.499 --> 00:04:20.940
- What's the matter?
- Oh...


79
00:04:21.441 --> 00:04:23.873
That son of a bitch!

80
00:04:24.073 --> 00:04:25.344
I don't
believe this.


81
00:04:25.375 --> 00:04:28.017
That bastard!
I can't believe this!


82
00:04:31.581 --> 00:04:33.703
I'll be in the penthouse
if you change your mind.


83
00:04:35.945 --> 00:04:37.657
Thanks for
the Espresso maker...


84
00:04:39.118 --> 00:04:40.339
And the bag of shit.

85
00:04:57.026 --> 00:04:58.408
Howard Suntz's office.

86
00:04:58.528 --> 00:05:00.600
Miriam, this is Diane.
Let me talk to Howard.


87
00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:01.721
I'm sorry,
Ms. Lightson.


88
00:05:01.751 --> 00:05:04.444
He left explicit instructions
not to be disturbed.


89
00:05:05.555 --> 00:05:07.577
What's going on
with this landfill deal?


90
00:05:07.607 --> 00:05:08.908
I'm only
his goddamn lawyer.


91
00:05:08.928 --> 00:05:11.220
- Why didn't I know about it?
- He said he's doing the deal.


92
00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:13.322
Your services won't be needed,
professionally or personally.


93
00:05:13.342 --> 00:05:15.645
Look, this is not about our
personal relationship, Miriam.


94
00:05:15.665 --> 00:05:17.437
This is business.
Do you understand?


95
00:05:17.467 --> 00:05:19.499
It's about my-- my
professional credentials,


96
00:05:19.519 --> 00:05:21.491
my-- my law firm's time.

97
00:05:21.881 --> 00:05:23.242
Why am I talking to you?
You know what?


98
00:05:23.262 --> 00:05:25.405
You just tell Howard
that I'm coming down there.


99
00:05:32.432 --> 00:05:33.933
Excuse me.

100
00:05:35.735 --> 00:05:36.546
- Oh!
- Hi.


101
00:05:36.566 --> 00:05:37.577
Hi. Glad you
could make it.


102
00:05:37.607 --> 00:05:39.118
Thanks. Diane Lightson

103
00:05:39.148 --> 00:05:40.600
I'm from the firm
of Masur and Glennet.


104
00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:42.722
Chris Thorne.
I'm sorry about the cold hands.


105
00:05:42.742 --> 00:05:43.753
Don't worry about it.

106
00:05:43.773 --> 00:05:45.144
The law firm
Masur, Glennet?


107
00:05:45.174 --> 00:05:47.006
Weese, Weiss,
Worple, Whip Me?


108
00:05:47.427 --> 00:05:48.978
Yeah,
that's the one.


109
00:05:48.998 --> 00:05:49.889
What's your specialty?

110
00:05:49.909 --> 00:05:52.141
Uh, investment syndication
and public flotation.


111
00:05:53.122 --> 00:05:54.203
It's got to be painful.

112
00:05:54.233 --> 00:05:56.165
- Would you like a drink?
- I'd love one.


113
00:05:56.185 --> 00:05:57.597
- Scotch?
- Great.


114
00:05:57.997 --> 00:05:59.008
Are you okay?

115
00:05:59.038 --> 00:06:00.930
- Yeah, fine.
- Scotch.


116
00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:02.822
Are you going
to the Suntz thing?


117
00:06:03.493 --> 00:06:04.934
Are you kidding?

118
00:06:04.964 --> 00:06:07.026
Not unless somebody holds
a gun to my head.


119
00:06:07.186 --> 00:06:08.888
He's a fraud.
He's a rip-off artist.


120
00:06:08.918 --> 00:06:11.220
It's all about buying lakes
and filling them with garbage.


121
00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:12.622
I don't know what set
you off in the elevator,


122
00:06:12.642 --> 00:06:14.504
but if I were you, I'd stay
away from this Suntz guy.


123
00:06:14.534 --> 00:06:16.145
Let's just say I have
a personal interest


124
00:06:16.175 --> 00:06:17.667
in this particular deal,

125
00:06:17.697 --> 00:06:19.559
so if you're not going,
can I borrow your car?


126
00:06:19.589 --> 00:06:21.491
- Whoa, whoa.
- I'm a good driver.


127
00:06:21.911 --> 00:06:22.932
I didn't say I'm not going.

128
00:06:22.962 --> 00:06:24.384
I just said I'm not
planning on going.


129
00:06:24.404 --> 00:06:27.006
Uh, I mean, uh...
I may have a low opinion of the guy,


130
00:06:27.026 --> 00:06:28.568
but if it's
that important to you...


131
00:06:29.739 --> 00:06:30.910
maybe you know
something I don't.


132
00:06:30.930 --> 00:06:33.202
- Maybe I should reconsider.
- I really like to drive.


133
00:06:33.232 --> 00:06:34.824
- I'll drive.
- I mean, I'm happy to drive.


134
00:06:34.844 --> 00:06:36.876
No, no. It's my car.
I'll do the driving, okay?


135
00:06:36.906 --> 00:06:37.907
Okay, great.
You drive.


136
00:06:37.937 --> 00:06:40.239
Could I? Who's going
for a drive? Are you, Chris?


137
00:06:40.259 --> 00:06:41.421
No, not tonight, Fausto.

138
00:06:41.451 --> 00:06:44.213
When? Where?
We love to drive.


139
00:06:44.233 --> 00:06:45.665
Are you going
to your house in the Hamptons?


140
00:06:45.685 --> 00:06:47.837
- No, no.
- That's fantastic. When are we leaving?


141
00:06:47.867 --> 00:06:49.499
Very, very early,
much too early for you.


142
00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:52.402
How about, uh, noon
in the parking garage?


143
00:06:52.422 --> 00:06:54.454
Noon is better.
We love it!


144
00:06:54.484 --> 00:06:56.085
- Fantastic!
- Great.


145
00:06:56.706 --> 00:06:58.408
I'm sorry about that.
That's...


146
00:06:58.428 --> 00:07:00.119
Fausto and Renalda Squirinizsu.

147
00:07:00.139 --> 00:07:02.181
I give them investment
counseling sometimes.


148
00:07:02.201 --> 00:07:03.673
They're Brazillionaires.

149
00:07:03.883 --> 00:07:05.435
They have breakfast
around 2:00 in the afternoon.


150
00:07:05.465 --> 00:07:07.126
- We'll never see them again.
- Good.


151
00:07:07.156 --> 00:07:09.088
So I'll see you
in the, uh, garage at noon.


152
00:07:09.108 --> 00:07:10.370
- Okay.
- Don't be late.


153
00:07:10.390 --> 00:07:11.871
- I won't be late.
- Good.


154
00:07:33.262 --> 00:07:36.205
Ohh. Ugh.

155
00:07:39.749 --> 00:07:40.760
Ugh.

156
00:07:53.012 --> 00:07:54.354
Morning, Mr. Thorne.

157
00:07:55.565 --> 00:07:58.047
- Morning, Mike.
- Fun night, huh?


158
00:07:58.788 --> 00:08:00.930
Oh, God,
I can't do this.


159
00:08:02.051 --> 00:08:04.113
- Listen, do me a favor, will you?
- Yes, sir.


160
00:08:04.133 --> 00:08:06.145
You know Diane Lightson?
She just moved in...


161
00:08:06.165 --> 00:08:07.357
Yes, sir. 23
-B?

162
00:08:07.387 --> 00:08:08.928
Yeah. She'll be down
in a couple of minutes.


163
00:08:08.958 --> 00:08:11.170
Tell her, uh...
Tell her I'm-I'm too tired,


164
00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:12.682
I'm sick,
I can't drive her, and...


165
00:08:12.712 --> 00:08:14.043
- Yes.
- give her the car with my compliments,


166
00:08:14.073 --> 00:08:15.585
- will you?
- Certainly.


167
00:08:15.605 --> 00:08:17.497
I got
to get some sleep.


168
00:08:25.124 --> 00:08:26.856
Give me the keys, Mike.

169
00:08:37.597 --> 00:08:40.920
Wow!
What a beautiful Beemer.


170
00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:42.382
Good morning.

171
00:08:42.582 --> 00:08:45.535
This is a vintage,
what, 733i?


172
00:08:46.416 --> 00:08:47.707
Three point three liter?

173
00:08:48.207 --> 00:08:49.439
That's right.

174
00:08:49.459 --> 00:08:50.980
Had it two years,
never been out of Manhattan.


175
00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:52.732
Really?
Well, maybe I should drive.


176
00:08:52.822 --> 00:08:53.663
I'll drive.

177
00:08:53.683 --> 00:08:55.104
Hey, uh,
let me get that for you.


178
00:08:55.134 --> 00:08:56.245
Thank you.

179
00:08:59.839 --> 00:09:01.991
Wow,
this is really cherry.


180
00:09:02.031 --> 00:09:03.693
Mm-hmm.
Make yourself comfy.


181
00:09:06.055 --> 00:09:07.056
Thank you, Mike.

182
00:09:07.076 --> 00:09:08.448
Hope you
feel better, sir.


183
00:09:08.688 --> 00:09:10.700
I feel great--
feel fine.


184
00:09:23.913 --> 00:09:25.475
What the fuck...

185
00:09:25.695 --> 00:09:27.196
I don't
believe this.


186
00:09:27.957 --> 00:09:30.209
I should have known
a Brazillionaire never forgets.


187
00:09:30.229 --> 00:09:32.572
- Chris!
- They're not coming with us, are they?


188
00:09:32.762 --> 00:09:34.033
- Agh, look at them.
- Chris!


189
00:09:34.063 --> 00:09:35.525
I can't say no.

190
00:09:35.655 --> 00:09:36.956
That's a nice Beemer.

191
00:09:36.976 --> 00:09:38.037
Chris!

192
00:09:38.498 --> 00:09:41.100
Chris, dude! I imagine that you did
not think we'd be up so early.


193
00:09:41.120 --> 00:09:42.402
Had no idea.

194
00:09:42.812 --> 00:09:44.103
Hi, Chris.

195
00:09:48.548 --> 00:09:50.770
Chris,
where are we going?


196
00:09:51.581 --> 00:09:53.763
We're going
to Atlantic City, Fausto.


197
00:09:53.783 --> 00:09:54.864
Get in the trunk.

198
00:09:57.006 --> 00:09:59.959
Good. Good.
We can see the Taj Mahal.


199
00:10:00.019 --> 00:10:00.880
I love it.

200
00:10:00.950 --> 00:10:02.822
I hear they call it
the ninth wonder of the world.


201
00:10:02.842 --> 00:10:05.785
Oh, we have the fifth
in South America, in Rio...


202
00:10:05.815 --> 00:10:07.877
Eh, the Christ of Corcovado.

203
00:10:07.907 --> 00:10:09.288
Hi, I'm Renalda.

204
00:10:09.318 --> 00:10:10.600
<i>Hola. Yo soy Diane.</i>

205
00:10:10.630 --> 00:10:12.802
<i>¡Ai! ¡Puedes hablar español!
¡No lo puedo creer!</i>


206
00:10:12.832 --> 00:10:14.063
This is my brother, Fausto.

207
00:10:14.083 --> 00:10:15.585
<i>Encantado.</i>

208
00:10:15.605 --> 00:10:17.577
Chris,
put this tape on.


209
00:10:17.607 --> 00:10:19.118
Let's chanka.

210
00:10:43.663 --> 00:10:45.555
This is nice.

211
00:10:46.015 --> 00:10:47.477
We are nice.

212
00:10:57.437 --> 00:10:58.898
So, how long have you
been divorced?


213
00:11:05.044 --> 00:11:05.875
Four years.

214
00:11:05.905 --> 00:11:07.016
You still love her?

215
00:11:08.157 --> 00:11:10.820
Nah.
Been over it for... weeks.


216
00:11:14.293 --> 00:11:17.647
Chris, this road is
such a dull place.


217
00:11:17.897 --> 00:11:21.371
We have a nice little
surprise picnic for you.


218
00:11:21.401 --> 00:11:22.231
Clean food.

219
00:11:22.261 --> 00:11:25.234
Let's take the car
into the countryside for a while.


220
00:11:25.495 --> 00:11:26.335
Countryside?

221
00:11:27.467 --> 00:11:29.399
This is
the Jerseyvania Triangle.


222
00:11:29.419 --> 00:11:32.031
Whole damn place is
a mess of burnt-out factories,


223
00:11:32.051 --> 00:11:34.163
junkyards, and coal fields.
Believe me, I know.


224
00:11:34.193 --> 00:11:36.476
My grandfather was
in coal commodities in the '30s.


225
00:11:36.496 --> 00:11:38.037
So let's go
and see them.


226
00:11:38.267 --> 00:11:39.909
- Naw, I don't want to get lost.
- You won't get lost.


227
00:11:39.929 --> 00:11:41.771
Look at all that
fancy equipment you've got.


228
00:11:41.801 --> 00:11:44.113
Take the next road. Let's see
if you can use all that shit.


229
00:11:44.133 --> 00:11:46.185
Ah, Fausto, I think
we should just keep going.


230
00:11:46.215 --> 00:11:48.057
I don't understand
what's the big deal.


231
00:11:48.077 --> 00:11:50.259
We made a nice little
surprise picnic for you,


232
00:11:50.279 --> 00:11:51.491
you invited us
on a drive,


233
00:11:51.521 --> 00:11:53.683
and now you aren't even driving us
where we want to go.


234
00:11:53.713 --> 00:11:54.914
Dude, you could be
a better host.


235
00:11:54.934 --> 00:11:57.767
Okay. Okay, listen.
How about this?


236
00:11:57.797 --> 00:12:01.280
If it won't take too long,
Road 329, parallel to the Pike.


237
00:12:01.310 --> 00:12:02.311
Okay, it crosses the Delaware

238
00:12:02.341 --> 00:12:04.514
and then
it crosses back here.


239
00:12:04.654 --> 00:12:06.145
There should be
beautiful river scenery


240
00:12:06.175 --> 00:12:09.348
and it won't take us
too far out of our way, okay?


241
00:12:09.769 --> 00:12:11.010
It's your dime, lady.

242
00:12:12.922 --> 00:12:14.674
Oh, this
is wonderful.


243
00:12:16.806 --> 00:12:18.848
¡Ai, pero que mangos!

244
00:12:18.868 --> 00:12:20.500
I have two big mangoes!

245
00:12:20.520 --> 00:12:23.012
- Oh, yes, he has the mangoes.
- Do you like mangoes?


246
00:12:26.175 --> 00:12:28.588
- Pull over, Chris.
- Oh, this is going to be wonderful!


247
00:12:28.618 --> 00:12:30.029
Fausto, I don't
want to stop here.


248
00:12:30.049 --> 00:12:32.291
- Now please, not in here.
- Not here.


249
00:12:32.311 --> 00:12:33.373
- Keep going.
- Chris,


250
00:12:33.403 --> 00:12:35.024
pull over to a vista.

251
00:12:35.054 --> 00:12:36.085
Come on.

252
00:12:41.561 --> 00:12:43.433
Oh, look, a village.

253
00:13:01.761 --> 00:13:02.432
Morning.

254
00:13:02.932 --> 00:13:04.764
Sell pork bellies,
buy gold.


255
00:13:07.206 --> 00:13:08.107
Oh, Jesus!

256
00:13:08.137 --> 00:13:09.789
Why, Chris, look out! Oh!

257
00:13:12.171 --> 00:13:14.003
- What is that, a vent pipe?
- It was a vent pipe.


258
00:13:14.023 --> 00:13:15.445
What do you want to do,
get out and kiss it?


259
00:13:15.465 --> 00:13:17.897
Ai, Chris, it smells.
It stinks. Go, go.


260
00:13:19.348 --> 00:13:20.620
Nice town, huh?

261
00:13:24.674 --> 00:13:26.546
Evel Knievel
and Mr. Clean.


262
00:13:54.434 --> 00:13:56.265
Ah, this is better,
this is better.


263
00:13:56.295 --> 00:13:58.888
- Pull over and find a nice table.
- I like it here. I'm hungry.


264
00:13:58.918 --> 00:14:00.299
Let's eat right now.

265
00:14:00.329 --> 00:14:02.662
- Let's open the whole thing up now.
- Yes, open it up.


266
00:14:02.692 --> 00:14:04.894
- Let's see, what do we have? What?
- I don't see butter.


267
00:14:04.924 --> 00:14:06.335
What do you mean,
"I forgot the butter"?


268
00:14:06.366 --> 00:14:08.157
- I didn't forget the butter.
- Mrs. Squiri--


269
00:14:08.187 --> 00:14:11.190
Antonio, Antonio the butler
forgot the butter,


270
00:14:11.210 --> 00:14:12.221
not me.

271
00:14:12.472 --> 00:14:14.594
- Chris, do you want a drink?
- I can't believe him.


272
00:14:14.614 --> 00:14:16.486
- No.
- Now, Diana, smile!


273
00:14:16.516 --> 00:14:17.847
- Eh, smile.
- This is a nice road.


274
00:14:17.877 --> 00:14:19.929
- Oh, yeah. Chris, Chris...
- It's nice.


275
00:14:19.959 --> 00:14:21.611
Smile.
I got you in the mirror.


276
00:14:21.701 --> 00:14:23.202
- Eh, smile.
- Oh, no. A cop.


277
00:14:23.222 --> 00:14:26.055
Oh.
Were you speeding?


278
00:14:26.366 --> 00:14:28.347
Sixty-five.
That's the national speed limit.


279
00:14:28.838 --> 00:14:30.710
Well, not everywhere.
It said 50 back there.


280
00:14:31.371 --> 00:14:32.372
Fifty?

281
00:14:32.452 --> 00:14:33.793
Why didn't you tell me?

282
00:14:35.144 --> 00:14:36.536
You don't have to stop.

283
00:14:36.566 --> 00:14:37.907
What? Right.

284
00:14:37.937 --> 00:14:40.139
Let's get out the guns
and blow out his front tires.


285
00:14:40.350 --> 00:14:41.361
Are you crazy?

286
00:14:41.381 --> 00:14:42.882
Of course I'm going to stop.
He's a policeman.


287
00:14:43.683 --> 00:14:44.904
What are you
talking about, dude?


288
00:14:44.934 --> 00:14:46.736
This is
a provincial cop, man.


289
00:14:46.756 --> 00:14:48.938
With this car, you could
easily get away from him.


290
00:14:48.968 --> 00:14:50.940
Let's see
if we could do 90.


291
00:14:51.070 --> 00:14:53.002
Are you kidding?
This baby'll do 130.


292
00:14:53.032 --> 00:14:54.133
- Oh, so let's do it!
- Good. Let's go.


293
00:14:54.323 --> 00:14:55.515
Go. Go, Chris.

294
00:14:55.545 --> 00:14:57.457
Thorne,
for Christ's sake, go.


295
00:14:57.477 --> 00:14:58.698
Go, man.

296
00:14:58.878 --> 00:15:00.410
You wimp chicken,
let's go!


297
00:15:00.430 --> 00:15:01.861
Hit it! Push it!

298
00:15:01.881 --> 00:15:04.464
This is a little
goddamn hamlet.


299
00:15:04.674 --> 00:15:05.895
Chris, go!

300
00:15:05.915 --> 00:15:07.026
Well, here we go.

301
00:15:11.220 --> 00:15:13.212
- Push it!
- I don't know about this.


302
00:15:13.232 --> 00:15:14.263
I don't know.

303
00:15:18.938 --> 00:15:20.860
Go, Chris.
Come on, Chris, go.


304
00:15:21.160 --> 00:15:22.662
Don't be scared.
Push it!


305
00:15:22.692 --> 00:15:23.703
We're winning!

306
00:15:23.723 --> 00:15:26.356
You have-- You have a BMW.
Act like it.


307
00:15:30.650 --> 00:15:32.532
- Faster!
- Uh...


308
00:15:33.112 --> 00:15:34.834
Now I think
you may be breaking the law.


309
00:15:34.854 --> 00:15:38.077
- Oh, forget about the law!
- Oh, but it is smooth, isn't it?


310
00:15:49.929 --> 00:15:51.681
Jeez, he's got
a fast car, too.


311
00:15:52.041 --> 00:15:53.212
Oh, sh...

312
00:15:53.483 --> 00:15:55.204
Chris, Chris, move it.

313
00:15:55.224 --> 00:15:56.846
For Christ's sakes,
move it, Chris.


314
00:15:57.186 --> 00:15:59.118
Uh, maybe we better stop.

315
00:15:59.949 --> 00:16:00.950
No.

316
00:16:01.551 --> 00:16:02.812
No, I think
I can lose him.


317
00:16:02.842 --> 00:16:04.744
Pull your vehicle
over now, please.


318
00:16:04.764 --> 00:16:05.775
Pull over now.

319
00:16:15.395 --> 00:16:16.686
What the hell
is that?


320
00:16:19.769 --> 00:16:20.890
Detour!

321
00:16:21.781 --> 00:16:23.843
- Chris, watch out!
- Ooh, here we go!


322
00:16:27.246 --> 00:16:28.257
Whoa!

323
00:16:37.346 --> 00:16:38.778
He still with us?
Uh-oh.


324
00:16:45.505 --> 00:16:46.526
Where the hell
are we?


325
00:16:48.067 --> 00:16:49.389
Go to the left!
Go to the left!


326
00:16:49.409 --> 00:16:50.560
Pull over. Get over.

327
00:16:52.642 --> 00:16:53.493
Oh, shit!

328
00:16:56.045 --> 00:16:57.597
Be careful
on this side!


329
00:16:58.017 --> 00:16:59.569
I'll do the driving,
all right?


330
00:16:59.599 --> 00:17:00.830
Just come on, get over!

331
00:17:04.734 --> 00:17:06.616
Just get to the right!
Just get to the right!


332
00:17:08.778 --> 00:17:09.819
Will you be quiet,
Fausto?


333
00:17:09.849 --> 00:17:10.940
Just let me drive, all right?

334
00:17:13.813 --> 00:17:16.265
Sir, this is a heavily-traveled
industrial artery.


335
00:17:16.285 --> 00:17:18.147
These trucks
own this road.


336
00:17:18.548 --> 00:17:21.200
Oh, man. I just want to get
to Atlantic city. What's--


337
00:17:23.092 --> 00:17:26.265
Sir, these speeds are not
advisable through here.


338
00:17:36.666 --> 00:17:37.927
<i>¿Tienes dolares?</i>

339
00:17:39.959 --> 00:17:41.200
Oh, no!

340
00:17:51.130 --> 00:17:52.131
Everybody relax.

341
00:17:52.412 --> 00:17:54.694
All they can do is cite me
and hand me a bunch of tickets.


342
00:17:54.964 --> 00:17:57.607
I'll pay 'em and we'll be
on our way back to the turnpike.


343
00:17:58.568 --> 00:18:00.870
Oh, I see.
It's all my fault now.


344
00:18:17.867 --> 00:18:19.599
Folks, meet Andy Griffith.

345
00:18:23.513 --> 00:18:24.794
Good afternoon.

346
00:18:25.134 --> 00:18:27.457
Driver, step outside
the car, please.


347
00:18:33.793 --> 00:18:34.774
Was I speeding?

348
00:18:34.944 --> 00:18:36.626
Sorry, wasn't sure
you were a real cop,


349
00:18:36.646 --> 00:18:37.887
and, uh, please...

350
00:18:38.368 --> 00:18:40.209
I mean that
in a complimentary sense.


351
00:18:40.420 --> 00:18:41.551
That's okay.
There's no law


352
00:18:41.581 --> 00:18:43.443
against having
a sense of humor.


353
00:18:43.763 --> 00:18:46.646
Now turn around, put your hands
on the roof of the car, please, sir.


354
00:18:47.407 --> 00:18:48.688
There you go, sir.
Spread 'em.


355
00:18:48.708 --> 00:18:49.719
Ah, come on, now, really?

356
00:18:49.749 --> 00:18:50.740
- Spread 'em.
- "Spread 'em"? Wha-- Ah--


357
00:18:50.770 --> 00:18:52.091
Oh! Com--!
Yeah, that's nice, thanks.


358
00:18:52.121 --> 00:18:53.212
The lower back, please.

359
00:18:53.232 --> 00:18:55.174
Thank you. Yeah.
Check the prostate. That's nice.


360
00:18:55.825 --> 00:18:57.046
Oh! All right.
Thank you.


361
00:18:57.807 --> 00:18:59.849
I got an itch right up in there.
That's good. Thank you.


362
00:18:59.869 --> 00:19:01.060
Not today, sir.

363
00:19:01.290 --> 00:19:02.321
Turn around.

364
00:19:02.702 --> 00:19:05.605
May I see your license,
registration, and insurance, please?


365
00:19:07.226 --> 00:19:09.208
- What's the charge?
- You were speeding,


366
00:19:09.228 --> 00:19:11.100
but that's not why
I began to follow you, sir.


367
00:19:11.771 --> 00:19:13.843
Back there in the village,
you failed to make a full stop


368
00:19:13.873 --> 00:19:15.104
at the intersection.

369
00:19:15.645 --> 00:19:16.706
Oh, really?

370
00:19:16.726 --> 00:19:18.157
Oh, I didn't even notice.

371
00:19:18.798 --> 00:19:21.320
Well, as I say, that's the initial
reason why I followed you,


372
00:19:21.351 --> 00:19:22.842
and why you're
under arrest now.


373
00:19:23.092 --> 00:19:25.334
The speeding and reckless
evasion will be overlooked


374
00:19:25.365 --> 00:19:26.466
if you cooperate now

375
00:19:26.486 --> 00:19:28.498
and quietly get in your car
and follow me.


376
00:19:28.528 --> 00:19:30.229
- Clear?
- Sir... Sir...


377
00:19:30.249 --> 00:19:31.711
Wait a minute,
wait a minute, wait a minute.


378
00:19:31.731 --> 00:19:33.663
This may be...
Valkenvania,


379
00:19:33.693 --> 00:19:34.834
but it is
still America,


380
00:19:34.864 --> 00:19:37.136
and we have an appointment
at Atlantic City, so we'd...


381
00:19:37.547 --> 00:19:39.048
just like to get going.

382
00:19:39.068 --> 00:19:41.240
Wouldn't mind, will you just
write a ticket here or...


383
00:19:41.351 --> 00:19:43.292
we could settle it
some other way, perhaps?


384
00:19:43.523 --> 00:19:44.884
Step back, please.

385
00:19:46.305 --> 00:19:47.757
I understand, sir,

386
00:19:47.907 --> 00:19:50.319
but, you see, that's not the way
things work around here.


387
00:19:50.450 --> 00:19:52.382
You're gonna have to follow me
a ways to the reeve,


388
00:19:52.722 --> 00:19:54.794
then it's up to him
how we proceed.


389
00:19:55.425 --> 00:19:58.077
- Reeve?
- The local justice of the peace.


390
00:19:58.658 --> 00:20:01.110
Now, I'm planning not to mention
the speeding to him,


391
00:20:01.701 --> 00:20:04.243
so I suggest you come
quietly and immediately,


392
00:20:04.374 --> 00:20:06.996
unless you want more trouble
than you're already gargling.


393
00:20:35.815 --> 00:20:37.687
Ai. What's that beeping?

394
00:20:38.468 --> 00:20:40.660
It means we're off the map
on this cartridge.


395
00:20:40.900 --> 00:20:42.872
What time does Suntz
start the hype?


396
00:20:43.042 --> 00:20:45.415
Six o'clock.
It's 3:30 now.


397
00:20:45.815 --> 00:20:47.997
We can still make it
if you just let me do the talking.


398
00:21:06.516 --> 00:21:08.468
Look at this
metal sculpture.


399
00:21:09.759 --> 00:21:11.541
They must be
into folk art.


400
00:21:11.691 --> 00:21:12.692
Folk 'em.

401
00:21:15.445 --> 00:21:16.706
What is that, music?

402
00:21:17.637 --> 00:21:19.328
They're
piping in music.


403
00:21:31.541 --> 00:21:33.302
"Enjoy your stay."

404
00:21:35.625 --> 00:21:37.346
What is this place?

405
00:21:38.508 --> 00:21:39.779
My God.

406
00:21:43.032 --> 00:21:44.594
So that's where
they buried Flipper.


407
00:21:44.624 --> 00:21:46.185
- Flipper's dead?
- Flipper's dead?

410
00:21:56.255 --> 00:21:58.277
It's like Robin Hood...
"Be polite."


411
00:21:58.438 --> 00:21:59.078
Hmm.

412
00:22:00.049 --> 00:22:01.721
Oh, and no cussing.

413
00:22:02.331 --> 00:22:03.693
Shit.

414
00:22:04.844 --> 00:22:05.945
Wow.

415
00:22:06.155 --> 00:22:07.637
Look at all
these toasters.


416
00:22:07.667 --> 00:22:10.530
There is a negativity
about this place.

00:22:38.648 --> 00:22:40.269
Oh, come on.

420
00:22:44.704 --> 00:22:47.046
There's
a funky karma here, man.


421
00:22:47.096 --> 00:22:48.317
Is this a joke?

422
00:22:48.337 --> 00:22:50.149
Ai, ai, ai, I hope so,

423
00:22:50.179 --> 00:22:53.082
because I don't think
I like it here at all.


424
00:22:53.543 --> 00:22:55.044
Where
the hell are we?


425
00:22:55.585 --> 00:22:57.627
Listen, do we have
to get out here?

428
00:23:14.574 --> 00:23:15.585
Hi.

429
00:23:25.655 --> 00:23:26.856
File in.

430
00:23:26.936 --> 00:23:28.217
Reassemble.

431
00:23:31.210 --> 00:23:32.652
Lucy, I'm home!

432
00:23:33.943 --> 00:23:35.885
Oh, yeah.
It's old, it's old.


433
00:23:36.406 --> 00:23:37.937
Right this way, folks.

434
00:23:43.583 --> 00:23:45.745
Wait. I'm entitled
to one phone call.


435
00:23:45.765 --> 00:23:48.207
Surely. And you're more
than welcome to make one if...


436
00:23:48.237 --> 00:23:49.499
we had a phone.

437
00:23:49.729 --> 00:23:52.181
- There's one in my car.
- Your car's been impounded.


438
00:23:52.892 --> 00:23:54.223
Impounded? Already?

439
00:23:54.844 --> 00:23:56.175
Step up
to the railing.


440
00:23:56.376 --> 00:23:57.377
Please.

441
00:24:02.792 --> 00:24:04.764
May I have your IDs,
everyone, please?


442
00:24:04.794 --> 00:24:06.175
I already have
yours, Mr. Thorne.


443
00:24:06.195 --> 00:24:07.537
Thank you.
Thank you.


444

only a couple minutes.

of Valkenvania is now in order!


447
00:24:19.829 --> 00:24:23.833
The Honorable Reeve
Alvin Valkenheiser presides.


448
00:24:51.571 --> 00:24:55.074
Okay, Dennis, give me
their licenses, ID,


449
00:24:55.094 --> 00:24:59.148
toll tickets, report cards,
notes from the teacher.


450
00:24:59.178 --> 00:25:00.470
There you go, Judge.

451

Traffic violation.
Contravention of village bylaw 23,


452
00:25:03.733 --> 00:25:06.436
failing in the execution
of a full stop at a place so marked.


453
00:25:06.456 --> 00:25:08.107
I recommend fine,
bond, and release.


454
00:25:10.360 --> 00:25:12.352
What else you want to do for 'em,
bake 'em a pie?


455
00:25:12.562 --> 00:25:14.484
All right here...

456
00:25:15.435 --> 00:25:17.006

Lawrence Thorne?


457
00:25:17.026 --> 00:25:18.297

Well, look at this.

465
00:25:33.403 --> 00:25:34.434
I will have you know

that my brother, Fausto, and I enjoy
diplomatic immunity in this country.

00:25:39.369 --> 00:25:41.501
Oh, yay, well, uh...

468
00:25:41.941 --> 00:25:48.007
And you are
the Fausto and Renalda...


469
00:25:48.638 --> 00:25:51.701
Squirrriinii...

470
00:25:52.111 --> 00:25:55.064
Squiriniz...

471
00:25:55.094 --> 00:25:58.167
Siz... Siz... Sizwi.
Sizwi?


472
00:25:58.458 --> 00:25:59.529
Friends of the bride.

473
00:25:59.549 --> 00:26:00.530
Yeah, that's right.

474
00:26:00.550 --> 00:26:01.541
We all want
to get married.


475
00:26:01.561 --> 00:26:04.614
No, sir. No wedding.
Moving violation...


476
00:26:04.714 --> 00:26:06.065
Failure to stop.

477
00:26:06.085 --> 00:26:07.256
Let's just be quiet

478
00:26:07.286 --> 00:26:08.368
and let him do
his little thing,


479
00:26:08.398 --> 00:26:09.619
and we'll be
on our way.


480
00:26:09.639 --> 00:26:12.051
Oh, I will let you
be on your way, and...


481
00:26:12.071 --> 00:26:14.734
Oh, when you go,
the cat's eyes'll spin!


482
00:26:14.764 --> 00:26:16.225
Now, listen!

483
00:26:16.245 --> 00:26:17.226
Okay.

484
00:26:17.256 --> 00:26:18.317
We'll listen.

485
00:26:21.300 --> 00:26:22.782
A-hey, hey, ho, ha, ho!

486
00:26:24.203 --> 00:26:26.335
Hula, hula, hula,
the boola, boola, boola!


487
00:26:26.376 --> 00:26:29.248
Look who's got the front seats
of the Mexican hat dance now.


488
00:26:29.268 --> 00:26:31.851
Just like a bunch of spiders
in a birthday cake.


489
00:26:33.723 --> 00:26:34.914
You might be interested
to know


490
00:26:34.934 --> 00:26:36.686
that you are not
under the jurisdiction


491
00:26:36.706 --> 00:26:38.688
of just any old
fishing license dispenser


492
00:26:38.718 --> 00:26:40.299
and stamp-pad jockey!

493
00:26:40.840 --> 00:26:43.443
We've always been set
to deal with the offenders


494
00:26:43.463 --> 00:26:45.134
once and for all
at their first appearance,


495
00:26:45.405 --> 00:26:48.107
quick as sump grease
through a 10-year-old goose.


496
00:26:48.578 --> 00:26:49.799
Congratulations.
I'm glad to know


497
00:26:49.829 --> 00:26:51.401
things are running
smoothly for you.


498
00:26:52.011 --> 00:26:53.723
Put out that dog rocket!

499
00:26:53.743 --> 00:26:55.124
Sir, sorry.

500
00:26:55.224 --> 00:26:58.588
In 1796, my forefathers
established this seat


501
00:26:58.618 --> 00:27:01.000
after the tenets
of the old shire charter.


502
00:27:01.080 --> 00:27:02.341
Shire charter?

503
00:27:02.632 --> 00:27:05.184
Excuse me, sir,
that's pre-Magna Carta.


504
00:27:05.214 --> 00:27:07.026
I mean, serfdom
and fiefdom stuff.


505
00:27:07.086 --> 00:27:08.788
Very good, young lady.

506
00:27:09.709 --> 00:27:12.301
Heh, you know, you and I ought
to spend a little more time together.


507
00:27:12.622 --> 00:27:14.173
Well, I'd-
- I'd like that.

508
00:27:14.203 --> 00:27:14.784
Would ya?

509
00:27:16.015 --> 00:27:18.398
Well, then, more on how
they packed me off


510
00:27:18.418 --> 00:27:19.779
to Farmers'
Mechanics' University


511
00:27:19.809 --> 00:27:22.372
in Gracefield, Ohio,
for my engineering degree...


512
00:27:23.933 --> 00:27:26.766
And how I fought the Germans
in World War I later.


513
00:27:26.796 --> 00:27:27.937
- But for now...
- Later?


514
00:27:27.957 --> 00:27:29.809
Wait, ho, ho, ho!
No later.


515
00:27:30.119 --> 00:27:31.511
Wait a minute.
What is this shit?


516
00:27:31.531 --> 00:27:33.192
Sir, no cussing in court!

517
00:27:33.222 --> 00:27:34.333
We don't want to hear
the story of your life.


518
00:27:34.354 --> 00:27:36.165
We just want to pay the ticket
and get the hell out of here!


519
00:27:36.185 --> 00:27:37.787
- I'm sorry, Judge.
- Well, look at him!


520
00:27:37.807 --> 00:27:38.858
He's going on and on!

521
00:27:38.888 --> 00:27:40.039
This court herewith
binds you over


522
00:27:40.069 --> 00:27:41.170
for a further appearance
to be held


523
00:27:41.200 --> 00:27:42.742
at 4:00 tomorrow afternoon.

524
00:27:42.762 --> 00:27:44.504
We so deem for the public
and common good


525
00:27:44.524 --> 00:27:47.026
that you be confined herein.
So for now...


526
00:27:48.067 --> 00:27:48.898
Good night, Irene!

527
00:27:49.979 --> 00:27:51.381
- Aah!
- Aah!


528
00:27:52.301 --> 00:27:53.312
Ai!

529
00:27:53.643 --> 00:27:54.654
Shit!

530
00:27:58.207 --> 00:27:59.268
What's the point
in that?


531
00:27:59.839 --> 00:28:02.311
They're clean.
No drugs, no guns, nothing.


532
00:28:02.331 --> 00:28:04.614
Ah, just another batch
of hot-pistol,


533
00:28:04.644 --> 00:28:05.775
lily-water
city chickens


534
00:28:05.795 --> 00:28:08.067
to run through Grandpa Alvin's
trick house.


535
00:28:08.548 --> 00:28:09.979
When I'm gone,
you'll be reeve.


536
00:28:09.999 --> 00:28:11.541
You can run things
any way you want.


537
00:28:11.871 --> 00:28:13.773
'Til then,
you just do your job.


538
00:28:13.793 --> 00:28:15.535
So help me, Dennis,
I'll cut you out of the will.


539
00:28:15.555 --> 00:28:17.136
You won't get so much
as Flossie the nag.


540
00:28:17.166 --> 00:28:19.138
I always do my job,
and you know it.


541
00:28:19.168 --> 00:28:21.651
But I don't mind letting you know
my duties end right here at this bench.


542
00:28:21.681 --> 00:28:23.753
Oh, fine.
Go suck a bug.


543
00:28:26.786 --> 00:28:27.857
Are you okay?

544
00:28:29.018 --> 00:28:30.640
What are we
going to do?


545
00:28:31.140 --> 00:28:33.483
- Oh, Fausto...
- What was that for?!


546
00:28:33.593 --> 00:28:35.094
How could you be
so insensitive?


547
00:28:35.124 --> 00:28:37.066
What do you mean?
What are you talking about?


548
00:28:37.096 --> 00:28:38.918
Fausto, you better do
something about this.


549
00:28:38.938 --> 00:28:41.921
Niña, you're pulling
on my coat. Now, cool it!


550
00:28:42.061 --> 00:28:43.252
I had us out of here!

551
00:28:43.573 --> 00:28:45.655
Then you had to go
and open your big mouth.


552
00:28:46.816 --> 00:28:48.197
You had us out of here?

553
00:28:48.408 --> 00:28:50.089
We would've been here
another two hours


554
00:28:50.119 --> 00:28:52.151
listening to the history
of the Valkenburger farm,


555
00:28:52.171 --> 00:28:53.573
or wherever the hell we are!

556
00:28:53.603 --> 00:28:55.294
I knew that I couldn't
depend on you.


557
00:28:55.314 --> 00:28:56.836
Listen, I don't need this!

558
00:28:56.856 --> 00:28:59.819
I was just trying to drive us
to Atlantic City for you!


559
00:28:59.839 --> 00:29:01.230
- Oh, is that right?
- Yeah!


560
00:29:01.250 --> 00:29:04.564
You're no longer
our financial advisor!


561
00:29:04.584 --> 00:29:06.295
You're fired!

562
00:29:06.376 --> 00:29:07.657
- Shut up!
- Shut up!


563
00:29:13.533 --> 00:29:15.585
Miami, baby,
here we come.


564
00:29:15.615 --> 00:29:17.357
- Yeah, you can just plant your body on me.
- Here, take this.


565
00:29:17.387 --> 00:29:20.289
- Oh, baby, I'll just come hold you...
- Have they got a Jacuzzi in this place, huh?


566
00:29:20.309 --> 00:29:23.012
- ♪ Get down to the pavement ♪
- ♪ Get down ♪


567
00:29:26.526 --> 00:29:28.518
♪ Funky and mysterious ♪

568
00:29:29.218 --> 00:29:31.330
♪ Some people live
in little grooves ♪


569
00:29:32.141 --> 00:29:34.394
♪ But Romeo needs
more room to move ♪


570
00:29:34.994 --> 00:29:37.216
- We got company.
- Want this?


571
00:29:37.246 --> 00:29:38.538
- Nah.
- Oh, shit.


572
00:29:38.558 --> 00:29:40.570
Oh, shit!
Pass it back.


573
00:29:40.590 --> 00:29:42.602
- Get rid of this.
- Oh, God. Get rid of the bottles.


574
00:29:42.632 --> 00:29:44.914
- Give me that.
- Yeah, yeah, you take the bottle.


575
00:29:45.865 --> 00:29:47.757
Hey, Arty, don't give
your real license again, huh?


576
00:29:47.787 --> 00:29:49.439
Don't worry.
I'll take care of it.


577
00:29:57.316 --> 00:29:58.888
- Where's the pot?
- Would you shut up?


578
00:29:58.918 --> 00:30:00.800
- No, I want you to pass it to me.
- No!


579
00:30:00.830 --> 00:30:02.712
- Did we stop?
- It's under the seat, Sharpy.


580
00:30:02.732 --> 00:30:03.743
Okay.

581
00:30:05.815 --> 00:30:06.976
Where's the bottles?

582
00:30:07.336 --> 00:30:08.378
Shut up.

583
00:30:11.340 --> 00:30:13.072
- My God.
- Good evening.


584
00:30:13.092 --> 00:30:15.174
Driver, step out
of the car, please.


585
00:30:15.685 --> 00:30:18.167
Okay.
Good evening, officer.


586
00:30:20.660 --> 00:30:21.701
Chief.

587
00:30:23.312 --> 00:30:24.974
Driver's license,
registration,


588
00:30:24.994 --> 00:30:26.776
insurance, and fitness
certificate, please.


589
00:30:35.695 --> 00:30:36.946
Okay, Arthur...

590
00:30:37.286 --> 00:30:39.138
- have you been drinking tonight, son?
- No.


591
00:30:39.158 --> 00:30:41.431
Yeah, I had a couple.
So what? I'm fine.


592
00:30:41.451 --> 00:30:42.862
I'm afraid
you'll have to blow.


593
00:30:43.152 --> 00:30:45.014
Blow you to get
out of a ticket?


594
00:30:45.034 --> 00:30:46.285
Forget it, Tom.

595
00:30:46.656 --> 00:30:47.867
That's not funny.

596
00:30:48.267 --> 00:30:50.029
I meant you'll have
to use a breathalyzer.


597
00:30:50.049 --> 00:30:51.521
I'll blow him.

598
00:30:53.473 --> 00:30:54.584
Maybe later...

599
00:30:54.754 --> 00:30:55.755
next century.

600
00:30:55.775 --> 00:30:56.956
Let's go, son.

601
00:30:56.986 --> 00:30:58.317
Oh, come on, officer,
we were--


602
00:31:04.764 --> 00:31:07.226
Ya- blew double drunk
within the village limits.


603
00:31:07.256 --> 00:31:09.449
- You're going with me.
- Sure.


604
00:31:09.569 --> 00:31:11.361
Whatever you say, officer.

605
00:31:12.402 --> 00:31:14.023
Say good night, copper.

606
00:31:14.384 --> 00:31:16.476
Please, please, no.

607
00:31:17.707 --> 00:31:19.008
Don't kill me.

608
00:31:19.809 --> 00:31:21.100
Chiefy, pal,

609
00:31:21.290 --> 00:31:22.772
I was only kiddin'.

610
00:31:25.314 --> 00:31:26.706
Okay.

611
00:31:32.942 --> 00:31:34.414
- No!
- My God!


612
00:31:34.434 --> 00:31:36.055
And will you look
at his face?


613
00:31:36.105 --> 00:31:37.897
Is that nose rubber?

614
00:31:38.097 --> 00:31:40.580
Hey, I don't want you.
I want Judge Wapner.


615
00:31:42.992 --> 00:31:45.144
I have to plead
the fifth dimension.


616
00:31:45.565 --> 00:31:48.498
Okay. Okay. Well,
let's see here, what we got...


617
00:31:48.518 --> 00:31:51.921
We got your, uh, crack
and ice cocaine here.


618
00:31:51.941 --> 00:31:54.824
You got your pills
and your vials of coke,


619
00:31:55.164 --> 00:31:57.357
snorters, and pipes,
and grinders, and...


620
00:31:57.387 --> 00:31:58.508
got your gun here

621
00:31:58.528 --> 00:32:01.451
and you got
your switchblade knives.


622
00:32:01.941 --> 00:32:04.183
Well, since you're all havin'
a whirl of a time


623
00:32:04.203 --> 00:32:05.825
on some some kind
of a hopped-up date,


624
00:32:05.845 --> 00:32:08.488
I believe that we can get this
all over relatively simply


625
00:32:08.518 --> 00:32:09.589
and have you people
on your way,


626
00:32:09.609 --> 00:32:11.581
so step forward
to the bench, please.


627
00:32:11.861 --> 00:32:12.862
Hey, see that?

628
00:32:12.892 --> 00:32:14.414
Thanks for understandin', Judge.

629
00:32:14.444 --> 00:32:15.795
You know
what I'm saying?


630
00:32:16.946 --> 00:32:19.048
You take care of this.
I'm gonna go out for a smoke.


631
00:32:19.068 --> 00:32:20.299
Go for a smoke?

632
00:32:20.319 --> 00:32:22.261
Dennis,
they've got guns, drugs.


633
00:32:22.281 --> 00:32:23.673
One of them
tried to kill ya.


634
00:32:23.693 --> 00:32:25.094
I'm staying to watch.

635
00:32:26.396 --> 00:32:28.778
Okay, I hereby find
all parties culpable


636
00:32:28.808 --> 00:32:29.909
in these matters as charged,

637
00:32:29.939 --> 00:32:31.541
and so choose to inveigh
the maximum levy


638
00:32:31.571 --> 00:32:32.592
for these violations,

639
00:32:32.612 --> 00:32:34.343
and do therefore deem
that you be conveyed


640
00:32:34.374 --> 00:32:37.186
to a wholly--
oh, awful place of execution


641
00:32:37.216 --> 00:32:38.868
wherein you shall
be put to death.


642
00:32:39.048 --> 00:32:40.199
Yeah!

643
00:32:42.712 --> 00:32:43.913
- Whoa!
- Whoa!


644
00:32:46.726 --> 00:32:49.899
- Aah!
- Aah!


645
00:32:52.171 --> 00:32:52.992
¿Que es eso?

646
00:32:54.944 --> 00:32:56.496
What's going on?

647
00:32:59.939 --> 00:33:01.411
Heh heh!

648
00:33:01.521 --> 00:33:02.732
Yes.

649
00:33:19.809 --> 00:33:22.321
What's go-goin'
on here, huh?


650
00:33:22.432 --> 00:33:23.312
I'll tell you what, there.

651
00:33:23.342 --> 00:33:26.095
I'll give you all your coke
and your grinders and your spoons,


652
00:33:26.135 --> 00:33:28.428
and pot and guns and knives
and all that back to you


653
00:33:28.458 --> 00:33:29.949
when you come out
the other end.

Look, I'm sure these
are reasonable people.


661
00:34:03.903 --> 00:34:06.175
They'll have to entertain
some kind of an offer.


662
00:34:10.430 --> 00:34:11.561
They're coming.

00:34:13.433 --> 00:34:14.834
Okay, folks.

664
00:34:16.526 --> 00:34:18.448
Git up here
for supper.


665
00:34:20.339 --> 00:34:22.021
See...
reasonable people...


666
00:34:22.051 --> 00:34:23.052
supper.

667
00:34:23.363 --> 00:34:24.073
Supper.

668
00:34:24.103 --> 00:34:25.625
Little white wine,
arugala salad,


669
00:34:25.655 --> 00:34:27.036
maybe some pasta.

670
00:34:52.362 --> 00:34:53.593
Welcome to supper.

671
00:34:55.855 --> 00:34:58.027
How 'bout a nice
Hawaiian Punch?


672
00:35:07.196 --> 00:35:08.398
Thank you, Judge.

673
00:35:10.029 --> 00:35:12.141
You know, there's nothing better
at the end of a long day on the road


674
00:35:12.161 --> 00:35:14.934
than a nice, warm glass
of Hawaiian Punch.


675
00:35:19.809 --> 00:35:21.280
Here's to good friends.

676
00:35:26.325 --> 00:35:28.948
Does he treat all traffic
violators this graciously?


677
00:35:28.968 --> 00:35:31.260
Only the ones he takes
special interest in,


678
00:35:31.280 --> 00:35:32.151
like bankers.

679
00:35:33.353 --> 00:35:34.564
Ants on a log, ma'am?

680
00:35:35.745 --> 00:35:36.836
Uh...

681
00:35:36.876 --> 00:35:37.727
Mm-hmm.

682
00:35:39.679 --> 00:35:41.100
Yeah, I'd...

683
00:35:41.130 --> 00:35:42.131
love one.

684
00:35:44.354 --> 00:35:45.264
Cousin?

685
00:35:45.284 --> 00:35:46.836
Oh, ants.
Oh, yeah, sure.


686
00:36:04.003 --> 00:36:05.154
Oh.

687
00:36:05.425 --> 00:36:06.155
Folks...

688
00:36:07.056 --> 00:36:10.870
I'd like to introduce
my granddaughter, Eldona.


689
00:36:12.362 --> 00:36:13.443
She's single

690
00:36:13.473 --> 00:36:16.275
and the best class "A"
mechanic in five states.


691
00:36:17.036 --> 00:36:18.247
She's adorable, Judge.

692
00:36:18.267 --> 00:36:20.179
She'd make
an ideal wife, too.


693
00:36:20.209 --> 00:36:22.031
Genuine wage-earner, and...

694
00:36:22.051 --> 00:36:24.023
struck dumb at birth
by a thunderclap.


695
00:36:24.323 --> 00:36:25.535
My kind of woman.

696
00:36:26.526 --> 00:36:28.898
I think the two of you'd
make a perfect couple.


697
00:36:29.689 --> 00:36:30.740
Hmm.

698
00:36:32.512 --> 00:36:34.434
You look pretty
this evening, sister.


699
00:36:34.464 --> 00:36:36.315
Doing something different
with your hair?


700
00:36:36.345 --> 00:36:37.417
Oh!

701
00:36:38.448 --> 00:36:39.168
Hmm.

702
00:36:42.492 --> 00:36:44.684
Eldona, would you
please prepare the meal?


703
00:36:44.704 --> 00:36:46.776
- Mmm.
- Thank you, dear.


704
00:36:48.968 --> 00:36:50.339
Hmm.

705
00:36:56.566 --> 00:36:57.537
Want to see
the wine list?


706
00:36:57.567 --> 00:36:58.598
Young man!

707
00:36:58.628 --> 00:37:00.370
It is basic
human politeness


708
00:37:00.400 --> 00:37:02.372
to share your conversation
with the whole table.


709
00:37:02.402 --> 00:37:03.663
So what's on your brain?!

710
00:37:06.275 --> 00:37:07.367
Alvin,
I was just thinking,


711
00:37:07.387 --> 00:37:09.469
you've got enough, uh,
vintage steel around here to make


712
00:37:09.499 --> 00:37:10.950
a few thousand Toyotas.

713
00:37:11.050 --> 00:37:13.242
Ever think of selling
the whole place to the Japanese?


714
00:37:13.993 --> 00:37:15.114
There you go!

715
00:37:15.124 --> 00:37:16.135
Does the Pope wear a hat?

716
00:37:16.165 --> 00:37:17.897
Was Sergeant York's mother
an angel?


717
00:37:17.927 --> 00:37:19.739
And will a banker
grope for money?


718
00:37:19.769 --> 00:37:21.351
I'm not a banker,
I'm a financial publisher.


719
00:37:21.371 --> 00:37:23.353
Yeah, well,
all I know is in '17,


720
00:37:23.373 --> 00:37:25.054
after they shipped me
off to fight,


721
00:37:25.074 --> 00:37:28.057
some New York financier
rolled in here one day and...


722
00:37:28.087 --> 00:37:30.600
hoglowsered and
tubwangled my grandfather


723
00:37:30.630 --> 00:37:32.251
into mining
the whole place out


724
00:37:32.532 --> 00:37:34.604
in exchange for shares
in something called


725
00:37:34.634 --> 00:37:36.706
the United Coke Company.

726
00:37:37.136 --> 00:37:40.860
Do you know what those stock
certificates are worth today?


727
00:37:41.330 --> 00:37:44.113
Just about the finest
outhouse wallpaper


728
00:37:44.143 --> 00:37:45.264
you've ever seen!

729
00:37:46.886 --> 00:37:48.428
We were forced to become

730
00:37:48.458 --> 00:37:50.329
what you
drove through today,


731
00:37:50.360 --> 00:37:51.871
a burnt-out coal field,

732
00:37:52.462 --> 00:37:54.123
and the biggest
icebox graveyard


733
00:37:54.153 --> 00:37:56.386
east of the Ohio
foundry belt.


734
00:37:57.006 --> 00:37:59.809
And that's why I never
let a banker go.


735
00:38:00.910 --> 00:38:03.062
So your grandpa made
a lousy deal.


736
00:38:03.082 --> 00:38:04.554
Is that our problem?

737
00:38:05.535 --> 00:38:06.676
Judge...

738
00:38:06.856 --> 00:38:09.539
that's a very
tragic, tragic story.


739
00:38:09.559 --> 00:38:10.650
I believe it is.

740
00:38:10.670 --> 00:38:12.372
You should
do a book.


741
00:38:16.496 --> 00:38:18.117
How do you like
your dog, folks?


742
00:38:23.453 --> 00:38:24.594
They're serving dog?

743
00:38:24.614 --> 00:38:26.376
No, no, no,
hot dogs...


744
00:38:26.406 --> 00:38:29.158
Dutch Country Herefords,
prize-winners.


745
00:38:29.489 --> 00:38:30.670
Hot dog.

746
00:38:31.200 --> 00:38:32.672
Stadium franks,
you know, like they had


747
00:38:32.692 --> 00:38:34.664
before they brought in
night games.


748
00:38:35.254 --> 00:38:35.925
Hmm?

749
00:38:46.366 --> 00:38:47.687

What was that?

769
00:40:21.030 --> 00:40:22.221
Just a mine fire...

770
00:40:22.311 --> 00:40:24.634
burnin' since 1926.

771
00:40:24.664 --> 00:40:27.266
Nothing that'll cause us
to interrupt our meal.


772

sick, wicked,


783
00:40:55.935 --> 00:40:59.869
funky, misanthropic,
codependent animals!


784
00:41:00.550 --> 00:41:02.362
I won't have my sister,

785
00:41:02.442 --> 00:41:04.243
who was once the queen
of the Mardi Gras,


786
00:41:04.273 --> 00:41:05.545
sitting at a table

787
00:41:05.565 --> 00:41:07.096
with a pickle-shooting
train!


788
00:41:07.927 --> 00:41:09.869
He's right.
We gotta go.


789
00:41:10.640 --> 00:41:11.411
Ai!

790
00:41:11.621 --> 00:41:12.622
Fine.

791
00:41:12.752 --> 00:41:14.023
- Oh!
- Come on, baby.


792
00:41:14.043 --> 00:41:15.715
- Aah!
- Aah!


793
00:41:23.533 --> 00:41:25.865
Ervilla, put that up.
Use the dogs.


794
00:41:26.836 --> 00:41:27.837
- Run!
- Run!


795
00:41:35.094 --> 00:41:36.586
Take your hand
off her!


796
00:41:36.786 --> 00:41:38.177
Ooh! Ah!

797
00:41:38.197 --> 00:41:39.519
That's more like it.

798
00:41:42.321 --> 00:41:45.344
Eldona, if you would please,
show them to their room.


799
00:41:45.675 --> 00:41:47.527
- Ow!
- Easy.


800
00:41:47.777 --> 00:41:49.048
Where do you
work out?


801
00:41:53.262 --> 00:41:54.994
Those people
have no dignity!


802
00:41:55.014 --> 00:41:57.136
Fausto,
you were a hero!


803
00:41:57.156 --> 00:42:00.299
Oh, Fausto, and they
had such ugly, ugly food!


804
00:42:01.070 --> 00:42:03.743
Oh, Fausto,
what is that smell?


805
00:42:04.444 --> 00:42:06.806
It smells
like São Paulo.


806
00:42:07.537 --> 00:42:09.359
- Toxics!
- Toxics!


807
00:42:09.439 --> 00:42:12.151
- Oh... Oh, no!
- Oh, baby, we've got to swim through that.


808
00:42:12.171 --> 00:42:14.554
Fausto, Fausto,
you're not going to make me swim


809
00:42:14.574 --> 00:42:17.537
through toxics, Fausto!
I cannot believe it!


810
00:42:17.557 --> 00:42:19.659
- Baby, we've got to get to the freeway!
- Ah, no!


811
00:42:19.679 --> 00:42:21.771
We've got to get
to the freeway.


812
00:42:21.801 --> 00:42:22.752
I don't deserve this.

813
00:42:22.782 --> 00:42:24.203
- How could I believe you could--
- Close your mouth.


814
00:42:24.223 --> 00:42:25.274
Okay.

815
00:42:25.925 --> 00:42:27.547
Oh, you let me go! Oh!

816
00:42:27.577 --> 00:42:28.628
Oh!

817
00:42:30.009 --> 00:42:31.010
Aah!

818
00:42:34.784 --> 00:42:35.755
Fausto!

819
00:42:36.285 --> 00:42:37.607
Come on.
Come on, let's go.


820
00:42:50.810 --> 00:42:52.502
You haven't got
the correct time, have you?


821
00:42:52.522 --> 00:42:53.963
My watch is slow.

822
00:42:57.236 --> 00:42:58.237
Ooh!

823
00:43:07.216 --> 00:43:07.577
Hmm!

824
00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:12.822
Let me see if I can
get a fire started.


825
00:43:16.936 --> 00:43:18.458
Fausto, we did it.

826
00:43:19.589 --> 00:43:21.120
- We did it!
- We did it, man!


827
00:43:21.150 --> 00:43:24.243
- We did it!
- Carlo Rossi to the Bahamas, man.


828
00:43:24.263 --> 00:43:26.606
- We're going to the Bahamas!
- We're going to the Bahamas!


829
00:43:26.636 --> 00:43:27.967
Having a nice time.

830
00:43:27.987 --> 00:43:29.389
- We did that. Let's go.
- Ai! Ai!


831
00:43:29.419 --> 00:43:30.420
Let's find a road.

832
00:43:30.450 --> 00:43:31.591
We hitch hike to a truck.

833
00:43:31.611 --> 00:43:33.132
- Okay, we hitch hike.
- We hitch hike to a truck.


834
00:43:33.162 --> 00:43:34.644
That is completely...

835
00:43:36.856 --> 00:43:38.548
Congratulations, folks.

836
00:43:38.908 --> 00:43:40.470
You made it
across our gully.


837
00:43:40.670 --> 00:43:42.041
You should
get a prize.


838
00:43:42.061 --> 00:43:45.815
Please, let us go.
Let our friends go.


839
00:43:46.025 --> 00:43:47.066
We're rich.

840
00:43:47.096 --> 00:43:49.028
- We'll give you anything.
- Solid.


841
00:43:49.058 --> 00:43:50.620
- Liquid.
- Rich.


842
00:43:50.860 --> 00:43:52.612
What am I gonna
do with money?


843
00:43:53.112 --> 00:43:55.845
All I do is work
for the reeve since I was eight.


844
00:43:56.005 --> 00:43:57.667
I got free
room and board.


845
00:43:58.087 --> 00:44:00.430
Only you have
the power to help us.


846
00:44:04.233 --> 00:44:05.234
Dude...

847
00:44:05.865 --> 00:44:08.768
it looks like you need
a nice couple of weeks...


848
00:44:08.788 --> 00:44:09.899
holiday, you know?

849
00:44:10.319 --> 00:44:11.330
Nice.

850
00:44:11.831 --> 00:44:13.853
Time off
from your job.


851
00:44:15.284 --> 00:44:16.956
You peeled
the correct banana there.


852
00:44:17.296 --> 00:44:18.458
Leisure time.

853
00:44:18.698 --> 00:44:19.749
Kick back.

854
00:44:19.779 --> 00:44:20.780
Nice.

855
00:44:20.810 --> 00:44:22.081
Fish tacos.

856
00:44:26.285 --> 00:44:27.527
Quick, hide.

857
00:44:27.637 --> 00:44:29.419
Go on, it's my cousin!
Come on!


858
00:44:29.449 --> 00:44:32.582
The original, all-purpose Ditch Witch.
Hide! Get down!


859
00:44:33.633 --> 00:44:36.636
All of this is about some
hustler who dumped on you, right?


860
00:44:37.286 --> 00:44:38.077
Isn't it?

861
00:44:39.008 --> 00:44:40.750
Well, what about Suntz?

862
00:44:41.210 --> 00:44:42.211
Really.

863
00:44:45.284 --> 00:44:46.406
I mean, what were you
planning on doing


864
00:44:46.426 --> 00:44:48.918
when you got down to Atlantic City
and confronted him?


865
00:44:48.938 --> 00:44:50.820
Slap his face in front
of a roomful of investors?


866
00:44:50.850 --> 00:44:53.553
That's a hell of a way to break up
with a guy, if that's what you're doing.


867
00:44:57.687 --> 00:44:59.979
So you picked
the wrong guy.


868
00:45:00.610 --> 00:45:02.422
Happens to the best of us.

869
00:45:05.044 --> 00:45:06.476
I've been through this.

870
00:45:08.287 --> 00:45:09.328
You know...

871
00:45:10.670 --> 00:45:13.202
when it comes to love,
there's no accounting for taste.


872
00:45:13.222 --> 00:45:15.775
Hell, I used to be
married to Imelda Marcos.


873
00:45:17.537 --> 00:45:19.559
You don't have to put
yourself through this.


874
00:45:19.819 --> 00:45:22.532
A guy like that's gonna
end up burying himself, anyway.


875
00:45:23.252 --> 00:45:25.975
He doesn't deserve you.
You're too good for him.


876
00:45:27.657 --> 00:45:30.279
Oh, I'm just such a jerk.

877
00:45:30.940 --> 00:45:32.201
I mean...

878
00:45:33.523 --> 00:45:35.985
why do I always pick
the wrong guy?


879
00:45:36.846 --> 00:45:37.947
I mean, I'm...

880
00:45:39.749 --> 00:45:41.330
I'm so trusting...

881
00:45:41.901 --> 00:45:43.373
and so gullible.

882
00:45:43.893 --> 00:45:45.004
I mean...

883
00:45:45.244 --> 00:45:48.718
I don't know why
I'm such a pushover.


884
00:45:48.898 --> 00:45:51.591
I mean, I'm such a sucker.

885
00:45:51.941 --> 00:45:52.992
Mmm.

886
00:45:53.182 --> 00:45:54.223
Mmm.

887
00:45:54.333 --> 00:45:57.397
I just love
a pretty face.


888
00:45:57.497 --> 00:45:58.508
Oh.

889
00:45:58.818 --> 00:46:00.099
Oh, it's so...

890
00:46:00.129 --> 00:46:02.622
Oh, it's so
embarrassing.


891
00:46:05.365 --> 00:46:07.336
Oh!
Ooh!


892
00:46:07.367 --> 00:46:09.058
I better lie down.

893
00:46:10.309 --> 00:46:12.201
Oh, you're
nothing but trouble.


894
00:46:12.231 --> 00:46:14.173
Ooh! Oh.

895
00:47:07.427 --> 00:47:08.748
What the hell
are you doing?


896
00:47:08.778 --> 00:47:10.249
That wasn't me.
That was the bed.


897
00:47:16.686 --> 00:47:17.427
Let's get out of here.

898
00:47:28.307 --> 00:47:29.599
Oh.

899
00:47:32.532 --> 00:47:33.533
Up here.

900
00:47:38.147 --> 00:47:39.328
Come on.

901
00:47:41.681 --> 00:47:43.052
- Oh...
- In this room!


902
00:47:45.064 --> 00:47:46.085
This way.

903
00:47:47.236 --> 00:47:49.459
- There's got to be a way out of here.
- Over here.


904
00:47:50.800 --> 00:47:52.201
Must be the nursery.

905
00:47:58.448 --> 00:47:59.449
Bat room.

906
00:47:59.479 --> 00:48:00.840
Ooh, guano.

907
00:48:02.261 --> 00:48:04.914
"Marjorie Valkenheiser.
She forgot to duck."


908
00:48:09.108 --> 00:48:11.250
- Jesus, it's moving!
- Oh! Aah!


909
00:48:12.081 --> 00:48:13.092
Ah! Ah!

910
00:48:13.553 --> 00:48:14.524
No! Oh, no!

911
00:48:14.544 --> 00:48:17.527
No! Oh! Oh, no!
No! Oh, oh, oh!


912
00:48:17.557 --> 00:48:22.932
- Ah!
- Aah!


913
00:48:23.973 --> 00:48:25.585
Oh, Jesus.

914
00:48:26.055 --> 00:48:27.617
We got to get
out of here.


915
00:48:27.887 --> 00:48:29.108
How far
does this go?


916
00:48:29.369 --> 00:48:30.370
It goes all the way to--

917
00:48:30.410 --> 00:48:31.250
- Oh!
- Oh!


918
00:48:31.270 --> 00:48:32.702
Ah!
All the way up to here.


919
00:48:32.722 --> 00:48:34.374
- Are you all right?
- Ooh! Ooh! Ahh!


920
00:48:34.404 --> 00:48:36.866
It's a blind staircase.
Maybe I can... oh.


921
00:48:36.886 --> 00:48:37.977
- Wait.
- Pull that one.


922
00:48:38.718 --> 00:48:40.490
Got it. Go on.

923
00:48:43.102 --> 00:48:44.023
Jesus, look out!

924
00:48:46.716 --> 00:48:48.207
- Hoh.
- You all right?


925
00:48:48.428 --> 00:48:49.459
Hah.

926
00:48:50.630 --> 00:48:53.403
I don't know how much more
of this crap I can take.


927
00:49:01.310 --> 00:49:02.412
We're trapped.

928
00:49:05.014 --> 00:49:06.866
Wow, look at all these IDs.

929
00:49:10.219 --> 00:49:11.381
What is this?

930
00:49:13.553 --> 00:49:15.004
There must be
thousands of 'em.


931
00:49:15.034 --> 00:49:18.588
Passports
and Auto Club cards.


932
00:49:21.270 --> 00:49:25.535
Wow, a license:
"Virginia Horse and Trappings, 1896."


933
00:49:25.985 --> 00:49:28.898
"Statewide search
for outlaw biker gang underway."


934
00:49:31.040 --> 00:49:33.112
"Busload of Hare Krishnas...

935
00:49:33.633 --> 00:49:34.904
"Disappears."

936
00:49:36.436 --> 00:49:39.459
"Ex

937
00:49:39.479 --> 00:49:40.830
'49.

938
00:49:40.980 --> 00:49:44.303
All these IDs match the--
the news clippings.


939
00:49:46.065 --> 00:49:47.156
Look at this.

940
00:49:48.668 --> 00:49:51.240
"Jimmy Hoffa Still Missing"
and here's his ID.


941
00:49:51.841 --> 00:49:52.772
Are you kidding?

942
00:49:55.395 --> 00:49:56.946
Oh, wow.

943
00:49:57.557 --> 00:50:00.930
You know, I think they've been
doing this around here since the 1890s


944
00:50:00.960 --> 00:50:03.563
and I don't see any reason
why they're gonna stop at us.


945
00:50:04.183 --> 00:50:05.705
I mean, look at this.

946
00:50:05.725 --> 00:50:08.257
They're all
criminals and creeps.


947
00:50:09.639 --> 00:50:10.640
Bankers.

948
00:50:12.231 --> 00:50:13.453
Exactly.

949
00:50:14.384 --> 00:50:15.705
Nah.

950
00:50:19.348 --> 00:50:20.370
Aah!

951
00:50:21.421 --> 00:50:22.542
What happened?

952
00:50:22.722 --> 00:50:23.393
Aah!

953
00:50:23.423 --> 00:50:28.247
- Aah!
- Aah!


954
00:50:58.998 --> 00:50:59.999
Oh.

955
00:51:01.160 --> 00:51:02.912
I wish we were
on that train.


956
00:51:05.765 --> 00:51:07.116
Me, too.

957
00:51:22.682 --> 00:51:24.183
Good luck, slick.

958
00:51:32.241 --> 00:51:34.183
Hey, look at this,
it's a slide.


959
00:51:34.203 --> 00:51:35.545
Yeah, but this is
no playground.


960
00:51:35.565 --> 00:51:37.196
Could be a bed
of spikes down there.


961
00:51:39.188 --> 00:51:42.251
- Let's go. Come on.
- Go. You go. Take it slow.


962
00:51:44.053 --> 00:51:45.965
Aah!

963
00:51:46.366 --> 00:51:48.598
Aw, shit!
Oh!


964
00:51:49.839 --> 00:51:51.170
Whoa!

965
00:52:02.251 --> 00:52:03.222
Diane!

966
00:52:03.403 --> 00:52:05.014
Oh, whoa! Whoa!

967
00:52:05.034 --> 00:52:06.115
Uh-oh. Diane!

968
00:52:06.145 --> 00:52:08.227
- Aah, ho, ho!
- Whoa, oh!


969
00:52:11.701 --> 00:52:13.443
Where? Why? What?
What? When?


970
00:52:13.463 --> 00:52:14.654
Oh, no!

971
00:52:16.035 --> 00:52:17.737
Oh.
What the...


972
00:52:24.193 --> 00:52:25.194

973
00:52:26.305 --> 00:52:27.306
Chris.

974
00:52:27.847 --> 00:52:28.868
Come on.

975
00:52:31.240 --> 00:52:32.241
Chris?!

976
00:52:32.271 --> 00:52:34.434
Chris, you get
down here right now!


977
00:52:34.844 --> 00:52:35.565

995
00:55:06.736 --> 00:55:07.847
For you to make--

996
00:55:16.406 --> 00:55:22.291
Gee, we have to finish this work
for Grandpa Alvin, okay?


997
00:55:22.311 --> 00:55:24.083
We're always
working for him.


998
00:55:24.113 --> 00:55:25.965
He treats us
like we're his dogs,


999
00:55:25.995 --> 00:55:27.467
not his grandsons.

1000
00:55:27.487 --> 00:55:29.829
We got
no human rights.


1001
00:55:30.219 --> 00:55:33.232
He's just mad
that we both got so fat,


1002
00:55:33.262 --> 00:55:35.635
we couldn't
finish high school.


1003
00:55:35.875 --> 00:55:37.407
You're the fat one

1004
00:55:37.437 --> 00:55:39.889
because you always eat
too much cereal.


1005
00:55:39.919 --> 00:55:41.691
You're the one
who's fat.


1006
00:55:41.711 --> 00:55:43.312
Not as fat as you.

1007
00:55:43.383 --> 00:55:45.314
- You're the fat one.
- No, I'm not.


1008
00:55:45.344 --> 00:55:46.856
Look, just get the hammer.

1009
00:55:46.876 --> 00:55:48.327
I got it.

1010
00:55:58.067 --> 00:56:00.149
Can't you
hold that straight?


1011
00:56:00.319 --> 00:56:02.942
Hey. You're the one
who's forging.


1012
00:56:02.962 --> 00:56:05.154
Can't you even see?

1013
00:56:05.174 --> 00:56:09.058
- I can see you're stupidest!
- Oh, that's it!


1014
00:56:09.449 --> 00:56:11.751
I am never
working for you


1015
00:56:11.781 --> 00:56:13.923
in this
foundry again.


1016
00:56:13.953 --> 00:56:15.515
Never!

1017
00:56:15.575 --> 00:56:18.207
Give me that. Go get
a ball-peen hammer.


1018
00:56:18.327 --> 00:56:19.328
No!

1019
00:56:19.369 --> 00:56:21.190
You know, the one
that's round on the end.


1020
00:56:21.220 --> 00:56:24.364
I know the ball-peen
hammer's round.


1021
00:56:27.326 --> 00:56:30.169
He thinks
I'm his child!


1022
00:56:32.151 --> 00:56:33.042
Ah!

1023
00:56:33.072 --> 00:56:34.023
Oh!

1024
00:56:34.043 --> 00:56:35.785
Trespasser!
Get her!


1025
00:56:36.065 --> 00:56:37.056
Get her!

1026
00:56:37.086 --> 00:56:38.257
Oh!

1027
00:56:38.648 --> 00:56:40.720
Stop, trespasser, stop!

1028
00:56:41.791 --> 00:56:43.042
Ah!

1029
00:56:43.803 --> 00:56:45.104
Ah!

1030
00:56:47.296 --> 00:56:49.208
- Hi.
- Eldona's got her.


1031
00:56:49.238 --> 00:56:50.650
- That's good.
- Yes, that's good.


1032
00:56:50.680 --> 00:56:51.621
Eldona's got her.

1033
00:56:53.232 --> 00:56:55.725
- That's not good.
- No, that's no good.


1034
00:56:56.185 --> 00:56:57.577
Ah!

1035
00:56:57.607 --> 00:56:58.808
No!
What are you doing?


1036
00:56:58.828 --> 00:57:00.850
No, Eldona! No!
Please stop!


1037
00:57:00.870 --> 00:57:02.872
Oh! No! No! No!

1038
00:57:04.654 --> 00:57:07.196
- No! What are you doing?
- No! No, no, no!


1039
00:57:07.226 --> 00:57:10.019
Don't throw her
in the minefire vent, please!


1040
00:57:10.309 --> 00:57:12.652
We just want
to play with her.


1041
00:57:13.172 --> 00:57:14.674
Ooh, thank you.

1042
00:57:16.436 --> 00:57:17.637
Thank you.

1043
00:57:23.252 --> 00:57:24.424
I know. I know.

1044
00:57:24.444 --> 00:57:25.635
We won't lose her.

1045
00:57:25.995 --> 00:57:27.076
Hi.

1046
00:57:27.467 --> 00:57:29.138
I'm Bobo.

1047
00:57:29.288 --> 00:57:31.100
That's Little Debbull.

1048
00:57:32.942 --> 00:57:33.943
Hi.

1049
00:57:33.973 --> 00:57:35.905
We're not allowed
in the house.


1050
00:57:39.499 --> 00:57:40.530
Oh, ho.

1051
00:57:40.550 --> 00:57:42.372
Is she okay?

1052
00:58:03.433 --> 00:58:04.794
Judge Valkenheiser.

1053
00:58:05.635 --> 00:58:07.096
- Judge!
- What?!


1054
00:58:08.297 --> 00:58:09.499
I got some speeders!

1055
00:58:09.779 --> 00:58:12.271
I'm bringing them in.
I'll meet you in the courtroom.


1056
00:58:12.321 --> 00:58:15.234
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Keep all your fat parts in one place.


1057
00:58:15.254 --> 00:58:16.676
I'll be right down.

Come on.
Everybody comes.


1068
00:58:42.862 --> 00:58:45.194
Man, would you look
at this place?


1069
00:58:45.254 --> 00:58:47.707
It's like
extremely Draculated.

00:58:47.787 --> 00:58:49.138
White man's heaven.

1071
00:58:49.158 --> 00:58:51.130
One at a time.
Here we are.


1072
00:58:51.160 --> 00:58:53.603
We're home. Let's go.
One, two, three.


1073
00:58:53.673 --> 00:58:54.684
Lickety-split.

1074
00:58:54.704 --> 00:58:57.046
She is one ugly,
cross-burning,


1075
00:58:57.066 --> 00:58:59.258
redneck, peckerwood
police bitch, man.


1076
00:58:59.278 --> 00:59:00.870
All right, move.

1077
00:59:02.111 --> 00:59:04.474
A good man's work
is never done.


1078
00:59:10.770 --> 00:59:13.403
Oh...
sat around all day


1079
00:59:13.833 --> 00:59:15.595
listening
to all those stories, why...


1080
00:59:15.615 --> 00:59:17.547
I want
to relax and just...


1081
00:59:54.894 --> 00:59:57.627
"Village Reeve Hurt
in Foundry Blast."


1082
00:59:58.037 --> 01:00:01.170
So that's what happened
to the poor, old, ugly pus-bag.


1083
01:00:01.200 --> 01:00:04.173
I thought I took care
of my vermin problem last year!


1084
01:00:04.534 --> 01:00:05.084
No!

1085
01:00:05.104 --> 01:00:07.126
I'm glad
I forgot my pistol.


1086
01:00:10.029 --> 01:00:11.881
Bad call, corn flake.

1087
01:00:11.901 --> 01:00:13.543
I left that leg
in France.


1088
01:00:13.893 --> 01:00:15.104
And now...

1089
01:00:15.214 --> 01:00:17.146
- I'm gonna stick you!
- Are you crazy?


1090
01:00:17.176 --> 01:00:19.749
I'm gonna dig
so many new holes in you,


1091
01:00:19.779 --> 01:00:22.101
you're gonna look
like a salt shaker!


1092
01:00:23.693 --> 01:00:26.656
Get your Italian loafers
out of my bedpan!


1093
01:00:26.686 --> 01:00:27.687
Ooh!

1094
01:00:34.844 --> 01:00:36.606
I'm going to make you
cry now, boy.


1095
01:00:37.527 --> 01:00:39.409
Chew on this,
you stinking relic!


1096
01:00:39.629 --> 01:00:40.510
My skunk!

1097
01:00:49.669 --> 01:00:53.182
You know, you are worse
than a week of yellow shit storms.


1098
01:00:53.202 --> 01:00:55.455
First I find you rooting around
in my private things.


1099
01:00:55.475 --> 01:00:57.857
Now you're making advances
against my little granddaughter.


1100
01:00:57.877 --> 01:00:59.158
I was just trying
to get away from you.


1101
01:00:59.188 --> 01:01:00.760
I ran into her, okay?

1102
01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:02.842
Well, she's got
your taint on her now.


1103
01:01:03.413 --> 01:01:04.143
Taint.

1104
01:01:04.183 --> 01:01:05.735
No choice
but house policy.


1105
01:01:05.775 --> 01:01:07.547
Fine. House policy.

1106
01:01:07.577 --> 01:01:08.798
What's house policy?

1107
01:01:08.828 --> 01:01:11.240
Well, whatever man touches her is
the one she keeps.


1108
01:01:11.270 --> 01:01:13.453
What?
What are you talking--?


1109
01:01:13.483 --> 01:01:16.005
Oh, no. Wait a minute.
Oh, no. Wait a minute!


1110
01:01:16.025 --> 01:01:17.206
Wait a minute!

1111
01:01:17.246 --> 01:01:19.739
I just went through
a goddamn stop sign.


1112
01:01:19.759 --> 01:01:21.421
I just want to get
to Atlantic City.


1113
01:01:21.441 --> 01:01:22.462
Please, judge.

1114
01:01:22.842 --> 01:01:24.604
She'll know
what to do with him.


1115
01:01:29.449 --> 01:01:30.910
What the hell is that?

1116
01:01:37.587 --> 01:01:39.729
Okay. What's going on?

1117
01:01:39.749 --> 01:01:40.750
Boy!

1118
01:01:41.040 --> 01:01:42.822
Oh, 12:30, isn't it?
It's kind of late.


1119
01:01:42.852 --> 01:01:45.755
I was dreaming there,
I was back in France on furlough.


1120
01:01:45.785 --> 01:01:47.987
Step forward, Constable.
What are the charges here?


1121
01:01:48.788 --> 01:01:49.799
Speeding.

1122
01:01:51.180 --> 01:01:52.341
Seventy-five in a 50.

1123
01:01:52.702 --> 01:01:54.243
In a hearse.

1124
01:01:54.734 --> 01:01:55.555
Well...

1125
01:01:55.585 --> 01:01:57.286
if it was an ambulance,
you got a chance.


1126
01:01:57.306 --> 01:01:58.998
If it's in a hearse,
gotta be worse.


1127
01:02:00.950 --> 01:02:02.091
Okay.

1128
01:02:02.331 --> 01:02:04.364
Oh, this is a union card, huh?

1129
01:02:04.554 --> 01:02:05.755
What are you,
mine workers?


1130
01:02:05.925 --> 01:02:06.796
Aw, man.

1131
01:02:06.826 --> 01:02:08.358
No, man.
We're musicians.


1132
01:02:08.588 --> 01:02:10.079
We're a hip-hop band.

1133
01:02:10.119 --> 01:02:11.561
- You know what I'm saying?
- That's right.


1134
01:02:11.951 --> 01:02:13.433
Hip-hop?
Musicians?


1135
01:02:13.453 --> 01:02:15.385
So youse, uh...
youse all musicians, huh?


1136
01:02:15.405 --> 01:02:16.446
Yeah. Deejays.

1137
01:02:16.476 --> 01:02:17.827
Constable,
you search the vehicle?


1138
01:02:17.857 --> 01:02:19.068
Oh, yes, sir, I did.

1139
01:02:19.098 --> 01:02:21.060
It contains
musical items.


1140
01:02:21.741 --> 01:02:23.383
Well, I, uh...

1141
01:02:23.873 --> 01:02:25.064
Well...

1142
01:02:25.995 --> 01:02:27.367
I'd better see them.

1143
01:02:27.567 --> 01:02:28.748
Bring 'em all in.
Set 'em up.


1144
01:02:28.768 --> 01:02:29.869
Let me see 'em.

to see you

1159
01:03:15.375 --> 01:03:16.466
Special day?

1160
01:03:17.326 --> 01:03:18.738
What is it,
Halloween?


1161
01:03:20.460 --> 01:03:22.902
Right this way,
Mr. Snappy Comeback.


1162
01:03:30.900 --> 01:03:32.051
Mm-hmm.

1163
01:03:33.373 --> 01:03:36.946
Hey, after this, you can see us
do our tag-team wrestling show.


1164
01:03:36.966 --> 01:03:38.788
Okay? Three.

1166
01:03:41.551 --> 01:03:42.552
Two.

1167
01:03:43.613 --> 01:03:45.475
Say, I got that!
I got that!


1168
01:03:45.495 --> 01:03:47.106
- I win. My deal.
- No, no, no, no.


1169
01:03:47.126 --> 01:03:49.068
Bobo wins because
Bobo's hand was on top.


1170
01:03:49.088 --> 01:03:50.500
Yeah. My hand's on top.

1171
01:03:50.520 --> 01:03:51.821
I win. My deal.

1172
01:03:51.841 --> 01:03:53.252
No, I won. My deal.

1173
01:03:53.272 --> 01:03:55.625
My hand's on top.
My deal. I win.


1174
01:03:55.645 --> 01:03:58.498
That's right, Debbull. It's Bobo's deal
because Bobo's hand was on top.


1175
01:03:58.528 --> 01:04:01.110
- Ah.
- Yeah, my hand was on top. I win. My deal.


1176
01:04:01.130 --> 01:04:01.951
Okay.

1177
01:04:02.271 --> 01:04:03.072
Okay.

1178
01:04:03.102 --> 01:04:05.274

1179
01:04:05.955 --> 01:04:07.326

1180
01:04:08.207 --> 01:04:09.589
Another bowl

01:04:09.939 --> 01:04:12.241
And if I win, I get...

1182
01:04:12.352 --> 01:04:13.543
Diane.

1183
01:04:16.796 --> 01:04:19.198

Yep.

1239
01:06:39.308 --> 01:06:42.532
You sure are a gaggle
of musicians, sure enough.


1240
01:06:44.173 --> 01:06:45.405
And now...

1241
01:06:46.426 --> 01:06:48.608
The disposition
of your case.


1242
01:06:49.479 --> 01:06:51.381
Uh, gather in
a little closer, there.


1243
01:06:52.051 --> 01:06:53.973
That's right.
Right there. Yeah.


1244
01:07:01.010 --> 01:07:02.041
In light of
your contribution


1245
01:07:02.071 --> 01:07:03.753
to the common good,
I hereby waive all fines,


1246
01:07:03.783 --> 01:07:05.365
suspend all sentences.
You're free to go.


1247
01:07:08.478 --> 01:07:10.089
Uh, huh, hol--
hey, hol-- hold the harvest.


1248
01:07:11.130 --> 01:07:13.633
There is another matter
before the shire court this evening,


1249
01:07:13.663 --> 01:07:14.674
and, uh...

1250
01:07:15.545 --> 01:07:17.617
Well, youse all
might be able to help.


1251
01:07:22.902 --> 01:07:24.574
- Where's Diane?
- Oh, she went home.


1252
01:07:24.594 --> 01:07:26.315
Listen, I got something
better for you.


1253
01:07:26.646 --> 01:07:28.418
First, I think
you oughta know something.


1254
01:07:28.808 --> 01:07:33.012
In many cases here, I do often
choose to inveigh the maximum levy.


1255
01:07:33.232 --> 01:07:35.785
Frequently, undesirables
are put to death.


1256
01:07:35.935 --> 01:07:37.977
Oh, sure,
I can understand that, Judge,


1257
01:07:38.007 --> 01:07:40.900
but come on...
death for running a stop sign?


1258
01:07:40.930 --> 01:07:43.533
And for being a banker.
That's the double death.


1259
01:07:44.554 --> 01:07:45.725
However,

1260
01:07:45.875 --> 01:07:48.598
I'd be willing
to cast aside all findings,


1261
01:07:48.838 --> 01:07:50.820
be blind
to your banker's blood,


1262
01:07:51.220 --> 01:07:53.593
let you live out
your days here as...


1263
01:07:53.933 --> 01:07:55.725
husband to my granddaughter...

1264
01:07:56.075 --> 01:07:57.717
father to her child, and...

1265
01:07:58.157 --> 01:07:59.859
heir to my seat.

1266
01:08:02.121 --> 01:08:03.833
Wha--
What are you saying?


1267
01:08:05.324 --> 01:08:06.806
It's death or Eldona?

1268
01:08:06.956 --> 01:08:08.428
Oh, come on, lad.

1269
01:08:08.448 --> 01:08:09.859
Take her hand.

1270
01:08:09.989 --> 01:08:12.231
Warm my tired
old heart.


1271
01:08:13.122 --> 01:08:15.324
I know women.
She loves you.


1272
01:08:15.535 --> 01:08:16.386
Ever since
she saw you,


1273
01:08:16.416 --> 01:08:19.048
she's been floating around
like milkweed in a spring breeze.


1274
01:08:19.559 --> 01:08:20.570
Mm-hmm.

1275
01:08:20.740 --> 01:08:22.021
Make her happy.

1276
01:08:22.291 --> 01:08:24.374
Take care
of her needs, and...


1277
01:08:24.794 --> 01:08:28.538
you'll inherit a fortune
Ali Baba would crave.


1278
01:08:31.621 --> 01:08:33.122
Listen, Judge...

1279
01:08:35.074 --> 01:08:36.225
Uh...

1280
01:08:36.716 --> 01:08:39.709
You know, I-I-I-I--
I've s-spent some time alone with her,


1281
01:08:39.739 --> 01:08:41.761
and she's
a spectacular woman.


1282
01:08:42.492 --> 01:08:44.974
She's quiet but, uh,
just shy, just shy.


1283
01:08:44.994 --> 01:08:46.606
- Mute.
- Ah.


1284
01:08:47.977 --> 01:08:48.928
But...

1285
01:08:48.948 --> 01:08:51.120
Judge, as far as her
needs are concerned,


1286
01:08:51.260 --> 01:08:53.993
I could never presume
to be able to fill them.


1287
01:08:54.053 --> 01:08:55.765
Oh, you can slip on
a pud collar.


1288
01:08:56.055 --> 01:08:58.368
Now, let me get you out
of these cuffs and chains,


1289
01:08:58.398 --> 01:09:00.109
and everything,
I'll get you all married up,


1290
01:09:00.129 --> 01:09:02.241
and we'll welcome
you to this family


1291
01:09:02.271 --> 01:09:04.173
with an
all-night reel.


1292
01:09:06.075 --> 01:09:08.257
- No cuffs, huh?
- No cuffs.


1293
01:09:11.481 --> 01:09:12.562
Pud collar.

1294
01:09:13.843 --> 01:09:15.264
Well, I must say...

1295
01:09:15.815 --> 01:09:17.477
It sounds
awfully tempting.


1296
01:09:19.869 --> 01:09:21.300
- Hit it!
- Yo.


1297
01:09:21.421 --> 01:09:22.642
Drop it, J.

1298
01:09:23.072 --> 01:09:24.073
That's it.
Again.


1299
01:09:26.726 --> 01:09:27.727
Yo.

1300
01:09:28.668 --> 01:09:30.069

Ahem.
The district and commonwealth,


1312

one...


1318
01:10:19.098 --> 01:10:20.950
Christopher
Lawrence Thorne.


1319
01:10:23.623 --> 01:10:24.974
Hmm.

1320
01:10:25.184 --> 01:10:26.195
Mmm.

1321
01:10:27.797 --> 01:10:29.058
And you...

1322
01:10:29.348 --> 01:10:31.030
Christopher
Lawrence Thorne...


1323
01:10:31.050 --> 01:10:33.493
confirm that you do...

1324
01:10:33.513 --> 01:10:34.714
take to wife...

1325
01:10:35.665 --> 01:10:38.287
one Eldona Marjorie
Valkenheiser?


1326
01:10:39.439 --> 01:10:40.520
Hmm.

1327
01:10:45.174 --> 01:10:46.215
Pardon?

1328
01:10:46.616 --> 01:10:48.538
- What? I can--
- What? Speak up!


1329
01:10:48.558 --> 01:10:49.949
I do. I do.

1330
01:10:50.980 --> 01:10:52.762
- Hmm.
- This office so recognizes


1331
01:10:52.782 --> 01:10:53.813
and certifies this union

1332
01:10:53.833 --> 01:10:56.736
and declares that you are
now wedded man and wife.


1333
01:11:00.089 --> 01:11:01.861
You may kiss the bride.

1334
01:11:02.271 --> 01:11:03.112
Yeah!

1335
01:11:03.142 --> 01:11:04.143
Well, Judge,

1336
01:11:04.163 --> 01:11:05.385
plenty of time for that
on the honeymoon.


1337
01:11:05.565 --> 01:11:06.836
You may kiss the bride.

1338
01:11:07.246 --> 01:11:10.069
No, not in front of all
these people, Your Honor.


1339
01:11:10.089 --> 01:11:11.100
Now!

1340
01:11:12.522 --> 01:11:13.893
Yo, way to go, homeboy!

1341
01:11:14.313 --> 01:11:15.425
- All right!
- Yeah!


1342
01:11:16.335 --> 01:11:17.377
All right, so,
let's get out of here


1343
01:11:17.397 --> 01:11:18.838
before the old man
changes his mind, all right?


1344
01:11:18.868 --> 01:11:21.391
- Yeah, okay.
- Wait! Wait! Help me!


1345
01:11:21.581 --> 01:11:23.272
- We're out of here.
- Wait! Help me!


1346
01:11:23.302 --> 01:11:24.644
- These are dangerous people.
- So long, man.


1347
01:11:24.664 --> 01:11:26.115
- It'll be all right. It'll be all right.
- No! No, please!


1348
01:11:26.145 --> 01:11:27.677
I was nervous
at my wedding, too.


1349
01:11:27.707 --> 01:11:28.938
- No! No, please!
- Just...


1350
01:11:28.958 --> 01:11:29.879
- You don't understand!
- ...never mind him.


1351
01:11:29.909 --> 01:11:31.811
He's just got
the wedding night jitters.


1352
01:11:31.841 --> 01:11:32.842
It's okay.
Just go on out


1353
01:11:32.872 --> 01:11:34.043
- the way you came. I'll...
- They're maniacs!


1354
01:11:34.073 --> 01:11:36.396
open the gate
and flip the bridge for you.


1355
01:11:36.586 --> 01:11:37.827
Now, you be cool, man.

1356
01:11:37.907 --> 01:11:39.098
Yeah, well, bye.

1357
01:11:39.118 --> 01:11:40.960
You weak-livered puffball!

1358
01:11:41.300 --> 01:11:44.904
Damn city-working,
yuppity well wallet!


1359
01:11:45.004 --> 01:11:46.926
Look how you hurt
my granddaughter!


1360
01:11:46.946 --> 01:11:49.008
Aah, you ain't
family material anyway.


1361
01:11:49.038 --> 01:11:50.620
No, Judge.
Aw, come on, Judge.


1362
01:11:50.650 --> 01:11:51.991
No, I tell ya,
I wasn't...


1363
01:11:52.021 --> 01:11:53.022
No, judge!

1364
01:11:53.042 --> 01:11:54.103
Why? I--

1365
01:11:54.133 --> 01:11:55.845
Aw, Judge,
wha-- Ah!


1366
01:11:56.125 --> 01:11:57.667
Wait!
Whoa, Nelly!


1367
01:11:57.687 --> 01:11:58.948
Aw, come on, Judge!

1368
01:11:58.968 --> 01:11:59.969
No!

1369
01:12:00.560 --> 01:12:01.711
So long, Charlie!

1370
01:12:05.214 --> 01:12:07.377
Come on, all right?
What the hell is this now?


1371

Eldona!


1412
01:13:59.298 --> 01:14:00.680
Mmm.

1413
01:14:12.271 --> 01:14:13.292
Mmm.

1414
01:14:17.236 --> 01:14:18.097
Okay!

1415
01:14:20.139 --> 01:14:21.361
Aah! Oh.

1416
01:14:22.331 --> 01:14:23.463
You go on,
get out of here!


1417
01:14:23.483 --> 01:14:25.054
Get out of here,
you big slushbag!


1418
01:14:25.074 --> 01:14:26.656
Go on back to your hole.

1419
01:14:27.146 --> 01:14:28.838
Excuse my grandkids.

1420
01:14:29.048 --> 01:14:31.871
- They're all spoiled pulp rotten!
- That's right.


1421
01:14:31.901 --> 01:14:33.363
Too much,
too easy, too soon.


1422
01:14:33.393 --> 01:14:35.094
Yeah, kids today, I know.

1423
01:14:36.496 --> 01:14:37.507
Thanks.

1424
01:14:37.837 --> 01:14:38.898
Want a mint candy?

1425
01:14:39.409 --> 01:14:40.620
Oh, uh...

1426
01:14:40.670 --> 01:14:42.171
No. No.

1427
01:14:43.683 --> 01:14:44.734
Missy...

1428
01:14:45.425 --> 01:14:46.956
I sure do hate
to cut and shuffle


1429
01:14:46.976 --> 01:14:48.458
a fine little muffet
like you.


1430
01:14:48.488 --> 01:14:50.420
- Oh, yeah, me, too.
- But I will...


1431
01:14:50.450 --> 01:14:52.181
if Joe Polo don't show!

1432
01:14:52.762 --> 01:14:55.054
- Now, he hurt my family.
- Okay.


1433
01:14:55.074 --> 01:14:56.876
Now, child,
you'll walk free...


1434
01:14:57.266 --> 01:14:59.228
scot-free,
right outta here.


1435
01:14:59.389 --> 01:15:01.371
You just get
on the two-way now


1436
01:15:01.671 --> 01:15:03.643
and tell Mr. High-class
to come on in.


1437
01:15:03.673 --> 01:15:05.214
Okay, I'll talk to him

1438
01:15:05.234 --> 01:15:06.536
- right now.
- Well, all right.


1439
01:15:07.156 --> 01:15:08.478
- Aah!
- Oh!


1440
01:15:08.538 --> 01:15:09.859
You okay, Judge?

1441
01:15:11.240 --> 01:15:12.852
- See?
- Wow.


1442
01:15:13.312 --> 01:15:14.524
You see that?

1443
01:15:14.734 --> 01:15:16.396
Now somebody's gotta pay

1444
01:15:16.416 --> 01:15:18.758
for the way
they sapped this ground.


1445
01:15:19.499 --> 01:15:21.320
- You want your pills?
- I'm all right.


1446
01:15:22.852 --> 01:15:24.724
Hey, hotworm!

1447
01:15:24.754 --> 01:15:25.465
Listen!

1448
01:15:25.815 --> 01:15:27.857
We got your pretty little
girlfriend down here


1449
01:15:27.877 --> 01:15:30.560
ready to go on the Gradertine
for a quartering.


1450
01:15:30.730 --> 01:15:34.764
But, because she's
a bright-eyed, smart-lookin' type,


1451
01:15:34.794 --> 01:15:36.686
I'm willing
to make a trade.


1452
01:15:36.856 --> 01:15:38.538
You lie down
in her place,


1453
01:15:39.078 --> 01:15:40.700
she goes free.

1454
01:15:40.730 --> 01:15:42.712
We'll all be happy,
including you.


1455
01:15:43.092 --> 01:15:44.193
Here, here, you tell 'im.

1456
01:15:44.223 --> 01:15:47.357
Where the hell's that dog-food-eatin'
grandson of mine, anyway?


1457
01:15:47.387 --> 01:15:49.198
Dennis!
Here, you talk.


1458
01:15:49.218 --> 01:15:50.720
Why, what's going on
with him, anyway?


1459
01:15:50.750 --> 01:15:52.492
What, is somebody not
giving him his napalm?


1460
01:15:52.522 --> 01:15:54.273
- Is he all over...
- Uh, Chris?


1461
01:15:54.414 --> 01:15:55.294
Hmm.

1462
01:15:55.324 --> 01:15:58.227
Hi. Um...
It's Diane.


1463
01:15:58.347 --> 01:15:59.959
Um, listen...

1464
01:16:00.259 --> 01:16:02.432
Run!
Run for your life!


1465
01:16:02.452 --> 01:16:04.354
Save yourself!
Tell the world about this place!


1466
01:16:04.384 --> 01:16:05.945
Just te--
Blegh!


1467
01:16:07.877 --> 01:16:08.908
Oh, boy.

1468
01:16:08.938 --> 01:16:12.712
You really put the pin
in the party hog now, girl.


1469
01:16:13.803 --> 01:16:15.505
You got five minutes
to come on in


1470
01:16:15.535 --> 01:16:16.666
or she gets cut
and shuffled.


1471
01:16:17.256 --> 01:16:20.430
Mind, now, no gallantry
and no suicide stunts.


1472
01:16:20.460 --> 01:16:21.921
You just come on in.

1473
01:16:22.061 --> 01:16:23.363
Come on, now.

1474
01:16:23.503 --> 01:16:24.824
Be a real man.

1475
01:16:24.844 --> 01:16:26.436
Surprise yourself.

1476
01:16:28.468 --> 01:16:29.479
Save the woman.

1477
01:16:29.819 --> 01:16:31.571
Give yourself up
for the girl.


1478
01:16:31.601 --> 01:16:32.512
Heh.

1479
01:16:32.542 --> 01:16:34.434
She'll cry over you
for weeks.


1480
01:16:35.485 --> 01:16:36.606
What's the matter, boy?

1481
01:16:36.716 --> 01:16:39.589
Heh, heh, heh.
Ain't she worth it?


1482
01:16:41.711 --> 01:16:44.063
All right,
you old liver spot.


1483
01:16:47.377 --> 01:16:49.359
Sorry about this, Diane.

1484
01:16:49.379 --> 01:16:51.260
But we have to tie you down

1485
01:16:51.280 --> 01:16:53.523
like Grandpa Alvin says.

1486
01:16:53.753 --> 01:16:55.935
I wish it was him
we were tying down


1487
01:16:56.165 --> 01:16:57.537
- instead of you.
- Yeah.


1488
01:16:57.567 --> 01:17:00.490
We don't like him,
but we love you.


1489
01:17:00.520 --> 01:17:03.162
This is a classic case
of a dysfunctional family.


1490
01:17:03.192 --> 01:17:05.605
I mean, you should consider
some help, some therapy.


1491
01:17:05.625 --> 01:17:06.786
He won't go!

1492
01:17:07.216 --> 01:17:08.778
Okay, cowboy.

1493
01:17:08.968 --> 01:17:10.380
Last chance saloon.

1494
01:17:10.890 --> 01:17:12.852
I'm gonna count down
from 10.


1495
01:17:13.182 --> 01:17:14.414
If I don't hear
your voice


1496
01:17:14.434 --> 01:17:15.905
by the time
I get to one,


1497
01:17:16.165 --> 01:17:17.627
- I'm gonna cut her!
- Aah!


1498
01:17:17.937 --> 01:17:20.620
- Oh, don't! Oh! No!
- Eldona, get them blades up.


1499
01:17:20.650 --> 01:17:21.731
Mmm.

1500
01:17:21.931 --> 01:17:23.683
Eldona, hey, listen...

1501
01:17:23.713 --> 01:17:25.204
You wanna...
Why don't we go to New York?


1502
01:17:25.224 --> 01:17:26.626
I'll take you
to Elizabeth Arden.


1503
01:17:26.646 --> 01:17:27.747
- We could do a lot--
- Ten!


1504
01:17:27.777 --> 01:17:29.088
Guys!
Get me outta here!


1505
01:17:29.278 --> 01:17:30.560
Nine.

1506
01:17:31.220 --> 01:17:32.692
Come on, now, banker!

1507
01:17:32.882 --> 01:17:33.933
Eight.

1508
01:17:33.963 --> 01:17:35.535
What's wrong
with this little girl here?


1509
01:17:35.565 --> 01:17:37.036
She a bad kisser
or something?


1510
01:17:37.417 --> 01:17:38.778
Seven.

1511
01:17:38.978 --> 01:17:41.070
Chris, I really didn't mean
for you to save yourself!


1512
01:17:41.240 --> 01:17:43.683
Get your ass back down here
and save me!


1513
01:17:43.883 --> 01:17:44.974
Six.

1514
01:17:45.004 --> 01:17:47.957
- Chris, get down here! Don't leave me!
- You ain't giving me much choice, boy.


1515
01:17:48.157 --> 01:17:49.949
- Five. All right, now, boy!
- Please, Chris!


1516
01:17:51.280 --> 01:17:52.372
Last chance saloon!

1517
01:17:53.292 --> 01:17:54.384
Four.

1518
01:17:54.634 --> 01:17:56.456
- Don't!
- Three.


1519
01:17:56.806 --> 01:17:58.768
- Two.
- Aah!


1520
01:17:58.788 --> 01:17:59.799
One.

1521
01:18:08.658 --> 01:18:10.550
- Diane! It's me.
- Help me!


1522
01:18:10.580 --> 01:18:12.231
Oh, god.
Hurry, get my hands.


1523
01:18:12.251 --> 01:18:13.152
- Hurry!
- Let's get outta here. Hold on.


1524
01:18:13.172 --> 01:18:14.504
- Oh, my god!
- It'll be all right.


1525
01:18:14.524 --> 01:18:15.545
Get my hands!

1526
01:18:15.565 --> 01:18:17.206
What the hell
took you so long?!


1527
01:18:17.226 --> 01:18:18.678
Okay, oh, get me out.

1528
01:18:18.948 --> 01:18:20.319
Oh, I knew you'd save me.

1529
01:18:20.350 --> 01:18:23.112
I think
I dirtied my diaper.


1530
01:18:24.033 --> 01:18:25.965
Oh, get me the hell
out of here, Chris!


1531
01:18:25.985 --> 01:18:27.457
He's fly-dicking
with me!


1532
01:18:27.537 --> 01:18:28.688
Eldona,
drop those blades!


1533
01:18:28.908 --> 01:18:29.909
Get him! Get him!

1534
01:18:29.929 --> 01:18:30.640
Aah!

1535
01:18:31.140 --> 01:18:32.221
- Aah!
- Shit!


1536
01:18:38.708 --> 01:18:39.218
Hey!

1537
01:18:40.820 --> 01:18:41.831
Get 'im!

1538
01:18:41.881 --> 01:18:43.613
Get aaah!

1539
01:18:43.633 --> 01:18:44.854
Who are
the infant bodies?


1540
01:18:44.884 --> 01:18:46.075
Bobo and Little Debbull.

1541
01:18:46.105 --> 01:18:47.216
They're not allowed
in the house.


1542
01:18:47.547 --> 01:18:50.580
- Get that spotlight, okay?
- Okay.


1543
01:18:50.640 --> 01:18:52.422
So what do you play
when you go to Atlantic City?


1544
01:18:52.442 --> 01:18:53.543
Blackjack? Craps?

1545
01:18:54.704 --> 01:18:56.576
Got to find them!

1546
01:19:06.025 --> 01:19:07.627
I don't think
they saw us.


1547
01:19:08.207 --> 01:19:09.439
- Come on.
- Okay.


1548
01:19:11.741 --> 01:19:13.413
Excuse me.
Coming through.


1549
01:19:14.394 --> 01:19:15.395
Sorry.

1550
01:19:16.486 --> 01:19:17.497
Excuse me.

1551
01:19:27.276 --> 01:19:28.738
Aw, we'll never
get across this.


1552
01:19:29.348 --> 01:19:30.360
Oh, no.

1553
01:19:30.550 --> 01:19:32.051
Let's head
towards the train.


1554
01:19:32.181 --> 01:19:33.192
Come on,
through the woods.


1555
01:19:33.322 --> 01:19:34.644
Smells like São Paulo.

1556
01:19:35.014 --> 01:19:38.077
- Who's that man that was with her?
- I don't know.


1557
01:19:38.107 --> 01:19:40.039
I don't know, neither,

1558
01:19:40.069 --> 01:19:41.581
but she got away.

1559
01:19:41.601 --> 01:19:43.583
You're the one that was
supposed to be watching her.


1560
01:19:43.613 --> 01:19:46.015
Oh, yeah.
That's the most beautiful girl


1561
01:19:46.035 --> 01:19:48.978
I've ever seen.
I feel stupid.


1562
01:19:48.998 --> 01:19:51.190
Bobo, shut up
and drive!


1563
01:19:51.471 --> 01:19:53.042
There they are!

1564
01:19:53.222 --> 01:19:54.494
On the hill!

1565
01:19:54.584 --> 01:19:55.955
Get 'em
before they get


1566
01:19:55.985 --> 01:19:57.096
to the top!

1567
01:19:58.057 --> 01:19:59.088
Stop them!

1568
01:20:02.642 --> 01:20:03.693
Okay.

1569
01:20:04.023 --> 01:20:05.314
- Hey! Hey!
- Hey!


1570
01:20:05.334 --> 01:20:06.456
Hold on!

1571
01:20:06.946 --> 01:20:09.268
- Stop! Hey, stop! Stop!
- Hey!


1572
01:20:15.465 --> 01:20:16.486
Now!

1573
01:20:20.069 --> 01:20:21.190
Come on!

1574
01:20:21.961 --> 01:20:23.473
- I'm with you.
- Right!


1575
01:20:27.417 --> 01:20:28.418
Come on, reach!

1576
01:20:28.448 --> 01:20:29.859
You can do it!
Come on!


1577
01:20:30.520 --> 01:20:31.561
I can't make it.

1578
01:20:31.641 --> 01:20:32.672
Trust me.

1579
01:20:32.792 --> 01:20:34.354
Come on, reach out!

1580
01:20:35.355 --> 01:20:37.206
Come on.
That's it!


1581
01:20:48.398 --> 01:20:50.750
Damn it! That's it!
How did I miss that one?!


1582
01:20:50.910 --> 01:20:52.382
We gotta get
some help.


1583
01:20:52.502 --> 01:20:55.204
As soon as the train stops,
we'll get off and call the police.


1584
01:20:56.315 --> 01:20:57.807
You saved my life.

1585
01:20:57.897 --> 01:20:58.968
Thanks.

1586
01:20:58.998 --> 01:21:00.339
It was worth it.

1587
01:21:09.569 --> 01:21:12.051
Bye, Diane!

1588
01:21:12.081 --> 01:21:14.384
- Diane...
- Bye-bye!


1589
01:21:14.614 --> 01:21:16.686
Bye, Diane.

1590
01:21:29.959 --> 01:21:31.371
Then we w-- had
that spinning bed,


1591
01:21:31.391 --> 01:21:32.582
the door flew up,
and we came...


1592
01:21:32.602 --> 01:21:34.103
got up into that,
uh, a-attic...


1593
01:21:34.123 --> 01:21:37.096
- Up in the attic.
- ...with the newspapers and, uh, the...


1594
01:21:37.226 --> 01:21:38.998
- all those licenses, and then...
- Yeah, that's pretty much where


1595
01:21:39.018 --> 01:21:40.570
- we found all the licenses of the, uh...
- ...and then...


1596
01:21:40.590 --> 01:21:41.801
- and the newspaper clippings...
- ...we kind of sat down...


1597
01:21:41.831 --> 01:21:42.932
- which matched each other.
- and had a cigar.


1598
01:21:42.952 --> 01:21:44.384
We were smoking a...
relaxing, and...


1599
01:21:44.414 --> 01:21:45.735
- Yeah, there was no way to know, I mean...
- All of the...


1600
01:21:45.765 --> 01:21:47.206
- It said Hoffa was still missing.
- What was that...


1601
01:21:47.226 --> 01:21:48.608
- As far as we knew, he was still there.
- ...an escape hatch, or whatever?


1602
01:21:48.628 --> 01:21:49.839
- Oh, we ended up in a tunnel.
- Anyway, this door opened...


1603
01:21:49.869 --> 01:21:51.100
...and we went flying.

1604
01:21:51.120 --> 01:21:52.341
Bobo and Little Debbull
saved me.


1605
01:21:52.362 --> 01:21:54.163
- Luckily, I was able to hear it...
- And we climbed the cliff


1606
01:21:54.193 --> 01:21:56.666
till we got on the train right
after the fuel dump explosion.


1607
01:21:56.696 --> 01:21:58.658
We think maybe
the Brazillionaires have been killed.


1608
01:21:58.688 --> 01:21:59.919
That's... dead.

1609
01:22:02.111 --> 01:22:05.024
You folks, of course,
will have to come with us


1610
01:22:05.054 --> 01:22:06.566
for identification
purposes.


1611
01:22:06.586 --> 01:22:07.647
Wait a minute.

1612
01:22:08.087 --> 01:22:09.699
This man removed
his nose and upper teeth


1613
01:22:09.719 --> 01:22:10.790
three inches
in front of my face


1614
01:22:10.820 --> 01:22:12.762
and started crooning
like Bing Crosby.


1615
01:22:12.782 --> 01:22:14.083
I'd like to help out,
but I'm pretty sure


1616
01:22:14.113 --> 01:22:15.324
I can pick him out
in a lineup,


1617
01:22:15.475 --> 01:22:16.666
you know what I mean?

1618
01:22:18.257 --> 01:22:19.579
We could do it.

1619
01:22:20.930 --> 01:22:21.611
We?

1620
01:22:45.024 --> 01:22:47.286
This is the state
attorney general.


1621
01:22:47.397 --> 01:22:49.869
We have a warrant
to search these premises.


1622
01:22:51.761 --> 01:22:53.182
Why-Why don't you just
blast your way in?


1623
01:22:53.433 --> 01:22:55.264
First, we have to serve
the warrant to someone.


1624
01:22:55.284 --> 01:22:57.146
You know, I bet we could
get them to come out.


1625
01:22:57.577 --> 01:22:59.178
- Us?
- You know, Miss Lightson doesn't have


1626
01:22:59.208 --> 01:23:00.620
a bad idea there.

1627
01:23:03.953 --> 01:23:04.964
Well...

1628
01:23:06.225 --> 01:23:08.948
I suppose
it's worth a try, if... if...


1629
01:23:09.198 --> 01:23:10.420
you two are up to it.

1630
01:23:11.040 --> 01:23:13.383
- It'd be our pleasure.
- Wait a minute. Wait.


1631
01:23:20.239 --> 01:23:22.662
Can't wait to see his face
when he gets a load of this.


1632
01:23:32.972 --> 01:23:33.973
Okay.

1633
01:23:46.446 --> 01:23:47.497
Yes?

1634
01:23:47.887 --> 01:23:49.579
Well,
what's going on here?


1635
01:23:50.179 --> 01:23:51.280
Who are you?

1636
01:23:51.300 --> 01:23:53.363
Why are you bothering
an old man?


1637
01:23:53.743 --> 01:23:54.994
You're through, Judge.

1638
01:23:55.925 --> 01:23:56.696
Oh...

1639
01:23:56.716 --> 01:23:59.168
you kids better
look out behind you.


1640
01:23:59.198 --> 01:24:01.220
There's a bee's nest.

1641
01:24:03.292 --> 01:24:05.314
Hi, Judge Alvin!

1642
01:24:05.395 --> 01:24:07.136
Evening, troopers!

1643
01:24:07.256 --> 01:24:08.988
Can't go too far
in this part of the world


1644
01:24:09.008 --> 01:24:11.671
without running across
my friends.


1645
01:24:16.376 --> 01:24:17.717
Alvin is something,
isn't he?


1646
01:24:18.077 --> 01:24:19.809
And... of course
we can't admit


1647
01:24:19.829 --> 01:24:22.271
that we appreciate the way
he gets things done.


1648
01:24:23.563 --> 01:24:24.834
And since you know
what you know,


1649
01:24:24.854 --> 01:24:26.756
I'm afraid we're gonna
have to come to...


1650
01:24:26.986 --> 01:24:29.048
some kind of a...
ar-arrange--


1651
01:24:36.896 --> 01:24:38.648
It's the coal fire!

1652
01:24:38.668 --> 01:24:40.259
The seams are giving way!

1653
01:24:40.590 --> 01:24:42.402
Run for your lives!

1654
01:24:56.386 --> 01:24:57.687
Come on, grab me! Grab me!

1655
01:24:57.707 --> 01:24:59.188
I'm not gonna lose you now!
Come on!


1656
01:25:00.069 --> 01:25:01.080
Gotcha.

1657
01:25:05.505 --> 01:25:07.767
Hey, what's
all that shaking?


1658
01:25:07.787 --> 01:25:08.878
I don't know.

1659
01:25:08.908 --> 01:25:10.830
I didn't
do anything.


1660
01:25:13.503 --> 01:25:15.314
Aah!

1661
01:25:15.334 --> 01:25:16.516
- You all right?
- Yeah.


1662
01:25:16.536 --> 01:25:18.528
- My Beemer! Get in!
- No. Come on, it won't start.


1663
01:25:18.678 --> 01:25:21.290
It's got a fuel cut-off switch.
It's part of the alarm system.


1664
01:25:23.463 --> 01:25:25.174
- No seat belts.
- No roof.


1665
01:25:38.858 --> 01:25:40.169
Oh, my...!

1666
01:25:58.448 --> 01:26:00.229
<i>¡Ai, Fausto!</i>

1667
01:26:00.249 --> 01:26:03.433
That was the most adventurous
weekend of my entire life.


1668
01:26:03.453 --> 01:26:06.456
When I think about what
happened in Valkenvania...


1669
01:26:07.256 --> 01:26:08.678
I would do it again.

1670
01:26:08.868 --> 01:26:09.889
Not me.

1671
01:26:10.710 --> 01:26:12.532
I was like James Bond.

1672
01:26:13.733 --> 01:26:15.204
Don't worry, Dennis.

1673
01:26:15.294 --> 01:26:18.067
Now that you are head
of our personal security...


1674
01:26:18.388 --> 01:26:19.859
And my lover...

1675
01:26:19.879 --> 01:26:22.652
Dude, your life's
gonna be fantastic.


1676
01:26:22.732 --> 01:26:24.083
And don't you worry.

1677
01:26:24.113 --> 01:26:25.274
No one's gonna
touch you


1678
01:26:25.304 --> 01:26:27.266
or my little
Flora de la Luna.


1679
01:26:27.286 --> 01:26:28.297
Ooh.

1680
01:26:28.968 --> 01:26:30.249
Dennis, listen to me...

1681
01:26:45.475 --> 01:26:47.006
You can-- Scare--
Squish--


1682
01:26:47.026 --> 01:26:48.347
S
-S
-Squerneesh.

1683
01:26:48.488 --> 01:26:50.229
Squershwammies!

1684
01:26:50.650 --> 01:26:51.661
Oh.

1685
01:26:51.911 --> 01:26:52.922
Ho.

1686
01:26:54.494 --> 01:26:55.785
T-T-Tie...
T-Tie...


1687
01:26:55.805 --> 01:26:57.697
T-T-T-Tie--
T-Tie the knot. T-Tie...


1688
01:26:57.727 --> 01:26:58.728
Tie
-Tie
-Tie.

1689
01:26:58.758 --> 01:26:59.859
Tie
-Tie
-Tie.

1690
01:27:00.740 --> 01:27:02.902
Go. Go. No, don--
Mon--! The bu--!


1691
01:27:03.453 --> 01:27:04.704
Woof! Woof!

1692
01:27:04.734 --> 01:27:06.235
No! Huh!

1693
01:27:07.236 --> 01:27:08.558
Hey, Chris?

1694
01:27:08.788 --> 01:27:10.019
Chris,
hey, hey, hey!


1695
01:27:10.950 --> 01:27:11.951
It's okay.
It's okay.


1696
01:27:11.981 --> 01:27:14.193
Take it easy. I think you're
just having a little napmare.


1697
01:27:14.223 --> 01:27:16.135
Oh. Ohh.

1698
01:27:16.546 --> 01:27:17.316
It's over?

1699
01:27:17.747 --> 01:27:18.788
Oh, yeah, it's over.

1700
01:27:18.808 --> 01:27:20.900
- You're okay, we're safe.
- Oh, god.


1701
01:27:21.310 --> 01:27:22.712
Take it easy.

1702
01:27:24.123 --> 01:27:25.745
Oh, jeez,
what a weekend.


1703
01:27:25.765 --> 01:27:27.246
Yeah, no kidding.

1704
01:27:27.357 --> 01:27:28.648
But it's okay.

1705
01:27:29.118 --> 01:27:30.289
I'm gonna go
take a shower.


1706
01:27:30.319 --> 01:27:31.330
- Okay.
- Okay.


1707
01:27:32.922 --> 01:27:34.043
- Just rest.
- I'll rest.


1708
01:27:34.063 --> 01:27:35.074
Okay.

1709
01:27:36.075 --> 01:27:37.797
I'm gonna watch
a little TV.


1710
01:27:39.939 --> 01:27:41.330
Numerous fire companies

1711
01:27:41.351 --> 01:27:43.433
from New York,
New Jersey, Ohio,


1712
01:27:43.663 --> 01:27:45.334
and all
neighboring states


1713
01:27:45.365 --> 01:27:47.166
are barely able
to handle


1714
01:27:47.186 --> 01:27:48.658
the subterranean mine fire

1715
01:27:48.688 --> 01:27:50.179
near the town
of Valkenvania.


1716
01:27:50.299 --> 01:27:53.413
- Diane, you should see this.
- Our Susan Campost is on the scene.


1717
01:27:53.443 --> 01:27:55.995
Roger, this cloud may
have a silver lining.


1718
01:27:56.015 --> 01:27:58.247
Geologists say the brief
but intense heat


1719
01:27:58.267 --> 01:28:00.119
from fissures

1720
01:28:00.149 --> 01:28:02.191
have cooked the upper
coal tailings


1721
01:28:02.211 --> 01:28:04.494
into a fine,
medium-grade crude...


1722
01:28:04.514 --> 01:28:06.996
