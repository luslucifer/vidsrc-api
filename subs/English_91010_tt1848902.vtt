00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:23.592
For you, picking Sarah Palin
was about winning an election,


2
00:00:23.626 --> 00:00:27.496
not necessarily about who's gonna
be best as vice president.


3
00:00:27.531 --> 00:00:30.800
My job is to give
political advice.


4
00:00:30.834 --> 00:00:33.102
We needed to do
something bold


5
00:00:33.136 --> 00:00:35.036
to try to win the race.

6
00:00:35.071 --> 00:00:37.172
If you had it
to do over again,


7
00:00:37.207 --> 00:00:39.608
would you have her
on the ticket?


8
00:00:54.724 --> 00:00:57.659
- Hello.
- They fuckin' hate me, Steve.


9
00:00:57.694 --> 00:00:59.327
Who's that, sir?

10
00:00:59.362 --> 00:01:01.630
Limbaugh, Hannity,
Coulter.


11
00:01:01.664 --> 00:01:04.333
They're dancing on my grave
like it's fucking Mardi Gras.


12
00:01:04.367 --> 00:01:06.569
That may be true,
but there's an upside


13
00:01:06.603 --> 00:01:07.969
to being in last place.

14
00:01:08.003 --> 00:01:10.773
You can say
what you truly feel.


15
00:01:10.808 --> 00:01:14.242
- You think I've been holding back?
- I do, Senator.


16
00:01:14.276 --> 00:01:16.044
The surge is working,

17
00:01:16.078 --> 00:01:18.480
but no one else
is brave enough to say it.


18
00:01:18.514 --> 00:01:20.484
Romney, Giuliani,
Huckabee--


19
00:01:20.518 --> 00:01:22.952
all your opponents
are hedging.


20
00:01:22.986 --> 00:01:26.288
Even you hesitated
at the last debate.


21
00:01:26.323 --> 00:01:27.924
A great man once told me,

22
00:01:27.958 --> 00:01:29.692
"I would rather
lose the election


23
00:01:29.726 --> 00:01:31.661
than see the country
lose this war."


24
00:01:31.695 --> 00:01:33.227
And I meant it, Steve.

25
00:01:33.262 --> 00:01:34.764
Then say it, sir.

26
00:01:34.798 --> 00:01:37.200
John McCain doesn't say
what's popular,


27
00:01:37.234 --> 00:01:38.868
he says what's right.

28
00:01:38.902 --> 00:01:40.269
My advice would be

29
00:01:40.303 --> 00:01:42.705
to get some old
POW buddies together


30
00:01:42.739 --> 00:01:45.107
and travel the country
in a small caravan.


31
00:01:45.141 --> 00:01:47.343
Stay in shitty hotels,

32
00:01:47.377 --> 00:01:49.345
do American legion halls,

33
00:01:49.379 --> 00:01:52.081
V.F.W. Posts,
have a few beers


34
00:01:52.114 --> 00:01:53.983
and enjoy yourself.

35
00:01:54.017 --> 00:01:56.619
You're right,
God damn it.


36
00:02:00.557 --> 00:02:04.426
I don't know what the hell's
wrong with me.


37
00:02:04.461 --> 00:02:06.295
You get so caught up
in winning,


38
00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:09.431
- you start to lose yourself.
- It's gonna be easy because


39
00:02:09.466 --> 00:02:11.767
there's only one message
you need to get across.


40
00:02:11.802 --> 00:02:13.836
Yeah? What's that?

41
00:02:13.871 --> 00:02:17.607
John McCain
puts country first.


42
00:02:25.649 --> 00:02:27.083
Would you consider joining us?

43
00:02:27.118 --> 00:02:30.987
Even just for a few weeks?

44
00:02:31.022 --> 00:02:33.556
Senator, there is no one
in this race


45
00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:36.660
I admire more than you,
but I promised my wife


46
00:02:36.693 --> 00:02:38.428
that I would
sit this cycle out.


47
00:02:38.462 --> 00:02:39.762
I know that, Steve,

48
00:02:39.796 --> 00:02:41.232
but will you just
think about it?


49
00:02:41.266 --> 00:02:43.132
Just do that-- just think
about it, will you?


50
00:02:43.166 --> 00:02:44.434
Of course, Senator.

51
00:02:44.468 --> 00:02:46.903
- You promise?
- I will, I promise.


52
00:02:46.937 --> 00:02:48.304
Great, I'll call you
tomorrow.


53
00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:50.474
- Okay.
- Thanks, Stevie boy.


54
00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:55.345
Fuck.

55
00:02:55.379 --> 00:02:57.347
Senator McCain today
re-shuffling


56
00:02:57.381 --> 00:02:59.148
his most senior
campaign staff.


57
00:02:59.182 --> 00:03:02.753
John McCain wins
the New Hampshire primary,


58
00:03:02.786 --> 00:03:06.656
a huge comeback for
the Senator from Arizona.


59
00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:08.125
You hear them chanting
behind me--


60
00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:09.793
"Mac is back,
Mac is back."


61
00:03:09.827 --> 00:03:13.296
A big win for John
McCain in South Carolina,


62
00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:15.064
a win that he will relish.

63
00:03:15.098 --> 00:03:16.731
The question on
the campaign trail was


64
00:03:16.766 --> 00:03:18.669
can a souffle rise twice?

65
00:03:18.703 --> 00:03:23.340
John McCain wins the republican
presidential nomination.


66
00:03:23.374 --> 00:03:24.942
What a historic night.

67
00:03:24.976 --> 00:03:27.010
And they said
we were dead.


68
00:03:27.045 --> 00:03:28.979
Next stop:
The White House.


69
00:03:36.487 --> 00:03:39.557
Obama! Obama!

70
00:04:01.446 --> 00:04:03.313
People of Berlin

71
00:04:03.347 --> 00:04:05.548
and people of the world,

72
00:04:05.583 --> 00:04:08.519
the scale of our challenge is great.

73
00:04:08.553 --> 00:04:11.255
The road ahead will be long.

74
00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:12.889
But I come before you

75
00:04:12.924 --> 00:04:16.460
to say that we are heirs
to a struggle for freedom.


76
00:04:16.495 --> 00:04:19.496
We are a people
of improbable hope


77
00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:22.064
with an eye
towards the future,


78
00:04:22.099 --> 00:04:24.301
with resolve in our heart.

79
00:04:24.336 --> 00:04:26.170
Let us remember
this history


80
00:04:26.204 --> 00:04:28.005
and answer our destiny

81
00:04:28.039 --> 00:04:29.807
and remake the world
once again.


82
00:04:29.841 --> 00:04:32.943
Thank you, Berlin.
God bless you.


83
00:04:32.977 --> 00:04:35.044
Thank you.

84
00:04:36.847 --> 00:04:39.715
If he heals a sick baby,
we're really fucked.


85
00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:41.752
We're down by 15.

86
00:04:41.786 --> 00:04:44.055
If his convention speech
is as good as that--


87
00:04:44.089 --> 00:04:45.422
it'll be better.

88
00:04:45.457 --> 00:04:47.025
Then we'll be
trailing by 20


89
00:04:47.059 --> 00:04:48.260
going into St. Paul.

90
00:04:48.294 --> 00:04:50.327
It's an uphill battle,
John.


91
00:04:50.362 --> 00:04:52.328
Well, as chairman Mao
was fond of saying,


92
00:04:52.364 --> 00:04:55.432
"it's always darkest before
it's completely black."


93
00:04:55.467 --> 00:04:58.670
Senator, it always concerns me
when you quote chairman Mao.


94
00:04:58.704 --> 00:05:00.438
This guy is raising money

95
00:05:00.473 --> 00:05:02.940
like he's some sort
of a human ATM Machine.


96
00:05:02.975 --> 00:05:05.043
John, if there
ever was a time


97
00:05:05.077 --> 00:05:07.611
to run a reverend Wright ad,
this is that time.


98
00:05:07.646 --> 00:05:10.047
- Absolutely not.
- I agree.


99
00:05:10.081 --> 00:05:13.683
There's footage of his own reverend
saying "God damn America."


100
00:05:13.717 --> 00:05:15.920
It's the single
best weapon we've got.


101
00:05:15.954 --> 00:05:18.790
I want to run a fucking campaign
that my kids can be proud of,


102
00:05:18.824 --> 00:05:21.592
and that precludes
attacking a black reverend.


103
00:05:21.626 --> 00:05:24.561
I think we're going
about this all wrong.


104
00:05:24.595 --> 00:05:28.399
This man is on the cover
of every news magazine.


105
00:05:28.433 --> 00:05:31.101
He's on the cover of every
entertainment magazine.


106
00:05:31.135 --> 00:05:35.540
He's got 200,000 people
screaming for him in Berlin.


107
00:05:35.575 --> 00:05:37.742
And what has he done?

108
00:05:38.776 --> 00:05:40.744
A man of no accomplishment

109
00:05:40.778 --> 00:05:43.247
has become the biggest
celebrity in the world,


110
00:05:43.281 --> 00:05:46.883
and we keep trying to reach up
and pull him down.


111
00:05:46.918 --> 00:05:49.688
What we need to do
is ask the American people


112
00:05:49.722 --> 00:05:52.023
a very simple question:

113
00:05:52.057 --> 00:05:56.527
Do you want a statesman
to be your next president...


114
00:05:57.795 --> 00:05:59.963
Or do you want
a celebrity?


115
00:06:01.934 --> 00:06:03.367
Try it.

116
00:06:05.136 --> 00:06:08.039
He's the biggest
celebrity in the world.


117
00:06:08.073 --> 00:06:09.874
Obama! Obama!

118
00:06:09.909 --> 00:06:12.343
But is he ready to lead?

119
00:06:12.377 --> 00:06:14.512
With gas prices soaring,

120
00:06:14.547 --> 00:06:17.949
Barack Obama says no
to offshore drilling


121
00:06:17.982 --> 00:06:20.984
and says he'll raise taxes
on electricity?


122
00:06:21.018 --> 00:06:24.356
Higher taxes,
more foreign oil--


123
00:06:24.390 --> 00:06:26.924
that's the real Obama.

124
00:06:26.959 --> 00:06:28.559
Great job, Fred.

125
00:06:28.593 --> 00:06:31.428
I thought we were
the grown-ups in this race.


126
00:06:31.463 --> 00:06:34.431
John, it's his girlfriend.

127
00:06:34.466 --> 00:06:37.501
This is a cautionary
tale, John.


128
00:06:37.535 --> 00:06:39.537
It's what I'm
talking about.


129
00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:43.340
Yeah, right.
Yeah, let's--


130
00:06:43.375 --> 00:06:46.144
- let's watch it again.
- No, I can't, I can't! Please.


131
00:06:47.445 --> 00:06:50.848
See, that's what
I'm talking about.


132
00:06:50.883 --> 00:06:53.518
Now can you
believe these guys?


133
00:06:53.552 --> 00:06:56.189
He wants Lieberman
on the ticket.


134
00:06:56.223 --> 00:06:58.423
- Of course he does.
- Disaster.


135
00:06:58.457 --> 00:07:00.158
Or historic.

136
00:07:00.193 --> 00:07:03.460
- Or historic disaster.
- John loves him.


137
00:07:03.495 --> 00:07:05.930
It would be a strong move
towards bi-partisanship.


138
00:07:05.964 --> 00:07:09.168
Guys, the base
is already concerned


139
00:07:09.202 --> 00:07:11.903
that John is not
a true conservative.


140
00:07:11.938 --> 00:07:15.808
Now, I don't think picking
a pro-choice Jewish democrat


141
00:07:15.842 --> 00:07:17.708
who just happened to be
Al Gore's running mate


142
00:07:17.742 --> 00:07:20.378
is going to alleviate
that concern.


143
00:07:20.413 --> 00:07:25.316
Maybe we have McCain
make a one-term pledge.


144
00:07:25.351 --> 00:07:28.219
He announces in some huge
speech that he and a democrat


145
00:07:28.254 --> 00:07:31.223
are joining together
for one term


146
00:07:31.257 --> 00:07:33.391
so that the parties
can come together


147
00:07:33.426 --> 00:07:35.894
and solve this country's
greatest problems.


148
00:07:35.929 --> 00:07:38.496
Maybe, with
a one-term pledge.


149
00:07:38.531 --> 00:07:42.334
Nothing says country first
like picking Joe Lieberman.


150
00:07:42.368 --> 00:07:44.769
Well, if it's gonna work,

151
00:07:44.804 --> 00:07:46.739
it has to remain
absolutely secret,


152
00:07:46.773 --> 00:07:48.606
right up until
the convention.


153
00:07:48.641 --> 00:07:51.176
If it gets leaked,
the right will kill it.


154
00:07:52.678 --> 00:07:54.880
John McCain's decision
to put Joe Lieberman


155
00:07:54.914 --> 00:07:57.217
front and center
at his convention


156
00:07:57.250 --> 00:07:59.218
has the unique distinction
of unsettling


157
00:07:59.252 --> 00:08:01.320
both democrats
and Republicans.


158
00:08:01.354 --> 00:08:03.555
I think the idea of him
being the republican


159
00:08:03.589 --> 00:08:06.091
vice presidential nominee
would split the convention.


160
00:08:06.125 --> 00:08:08.327
In the cabinet, fine.
Not as V.P.


161
00:08:08.361 --> 00:08:10.128
Bad choice.
Conservatives will bolt.


162
00:08:10.164 --> 00:08:12.430
Comedy team of McCain
and Lieberman.


163
00:08:12.465 --> 00:08:14.566
Maybe they'll play
Atlantic City this summer.


164
00:08:15.434 --> 00:08:17.269
Thank you.

165
00:08:17.304 --> 00:08:19.536
So what the fuck
happened?


166
00:08:19.571 --> 00:08:22.574
Lindsey Graham was trying to
build support for the idea


167
00:08:22.608 --> 00:08:24.743
- and it leaked.
- God damn it, Lindsey.


168
00:08:24.777 --> 00:08:27.347
Well, if it's
any consolation,


169
00:08:27.381 --> 00:08:29.515
my numbers show that
if you pick Lieberman


170
00:08:29.549 --> 00:08:31.917
or any pro-choice
candidate,


171
00:08:31.952 --> 00:08:34.053
40% of your
core supporters


172
00:08:34.088 --> 00:08:35.921
will be less likely
to support you.


173
00:08:35.954 --> 00:08:37.356
40%.

174
00:08:37.390 --> 00:08:39.658
And you gain
very few independents.


175
00:08:39.693 --> 00:08:41.493
Overall,
it's a wide-net negative.


176
00:08:41.527 --> 00:08:43.796
We've made a lot of calls.
Some people don't even think


177
00:08:43.830 --> 00:08:45.932
Lieberman can make it
through the convention.


178
00:08:45.966 --> 00:08:47.432
Others say,
yeah, he can,


179
00:08:47.467 --> 00:08:49.834
but he's gonna rip
the party in half.


180
00:08:49.869 --> 00:08:51.703
But Joe is perfect.
We're both mavericks


181
00:08:51.737 --> 00:08:54.340
that are hated by the
assholes in our own parties.


182
00:08:54.375 --> 00:08:57.110
It could have a tremendous
healing effect on the country.


183
00:08:57.144 --> 00:08:59.478
We can't win
without our base.


184
00:08:59.512 --> 00:09:01.347
Lieberman is
the right thing to do,


185
00:09:01.382 --> 00:09:03.348
but the wrong way to win.

186
00:09:04.984 --> 00:09:08.120
- Who all have we vetted?
- Romney, Crist, Pawlenty.


187
00:09:08.154 --> 00:09:11.124
- We're trying to vet Bloomberg.
- Who can we win with?


188
00:09:11.158 --> 00:09:12.825
- None of them.
- None of them?


189
00:09:12.859 --> 00:09:16.462
John, Obama just changed
the entire dynamic.


190
00:09:16.496 --> 00:09:18.531
It is a change year, sir.

191
00:09:18.565 --> 00:09:21.567
We desperately need
a game-changing pick,


192
00:09:21.601 --> 00:09:25.438
and none of these middle-aged
white guys are game-changers.


193
00:09:25.472 --> 00:09:28.809
So... what?

194
00:09:28.843 --> 00:09:30.644
I just fuck off and die?

195
00:09:30.678 --> 00:09:34.314
Well, the data shows we have
four things we have to do.


196
00:09:34.348 --> 00:09:36.749
We have to win back
the independents,


197
00:09:36.783 --> 00:09:38.185
we have to
excite the base,


198
00:09:38.218 --> 00:09:41.620
we have to distance ourselves
from the Bush administration,


199
00:09:41.655 --> 00:09:43.991
and we have to close
the gender gap.


200
00:09:44.025 --> 00:09:46.693
How bad is the gap?

201
00:09:46.727 --> 00:09:49.162
It's fatal.

202
00:09:49.196 --> 00:09:53.333
You've got a 20% advantage
with men, which is great,


203
00:09:53.367 --> 00:09:55.634
but a 20% deficit
with women.


204
00:09:55.669 --> 00:09:58.471
You've got to pick up

205
00:09:58.505 --> 00:10:02.176
Because if you're trailing
by more than five with them,


206
00:10:02.210 --> 00:10:03.677
you lose.

207
00:10:06.180 --> 00:10:08.247
So find me a woman.

208
00:10:10.551 --> 00:10:13.887
All right, ladies.
Who's it gonna be?


209
00:10:20.827 --> 00:10:25.165
Meg Whitman supports
abortion rights.


210
00:10:27.167 --> 00:10:30.170
Pro-choice, pro-choice.

211
00:10:33.108 --> 00:10:36.276
- Who are you?
- These solar arrays combined


212
00:10:36.311 --> 00:10:40.247
will allow us to produce

213
00:10:42.751 --> 00:10:45.619
To make sure
that risk management


214
00:10:45.654 --> 00:10:48.522
is the best that
we can do to secure...


215
00:10:50.058 --> 00:10:53.794
But as you know, the turnpike
ends here in Augusta.


216
00:10:53.829 --> 00:10:55.662
At that point...

217
00:11:01.169 --> 00:11:03.202
What was her name?

218
00:11:05.240 --> 00:11:07.775
Once Alaska is allowed

219
00:11:07.809 --> 00:11:10.945
to very responsibly and
safely develop our resources,


220
00:11:10.979 --> 00:11:13.014
we'll lower costs of energy
across the United States,


221
00:11:13.048 --> 00:11:15.282
and then we'd be able
to secure the nation


222
00:11:15.316 --> 00:11:18.285
with a clean, domestic
supply of energy.


223
00:11:19.487 --> 00:11:21.956
And I say that, Charlie,
even personally.


224
00:11:21.990 --> 00:11:24.358
My one and only son,
my 18-year-old,


225
00:11:24.392 --> 00:11:26.193
he just signed up
for the United States army.


226
00:11:26.227 --> 00:11:27.662
He's at boot camp
right now.


227
00:11:27.696 --> 00:11:29.129
And I'm thinkin',
you know,


228
00:11:29.164 --> 00:11:32.967
this kid is doing all
that he can within his power


229
00:11:33.002 --> 00:11:36.604
to help secure and defend
the United States.


230
00:11:36.638 --> 00:11:39.340
Every elected official had
better be asking themselves,


231
00:11:39.374 --> 00:11:41.776
are you doing as much also?

232
00:11:41.811 --> 00:11:44.011
Are you doing
all that you can?


233
00:11:46.514 --> 00:11:48.015
She's a star.

234
00:11:48.050 --> 00:11:51.519
She's so passionately
pro-life that at age 44,


235
00:11:51.553 --> 00:11:53.054
she decided
to keep a child


236
00:11:53.088 --> 00:11:56.290
that she knew mid-term
had down's syndrome.


237
00:11:56.324 --> 00:11:58.759
And there's a lot more
that the base will love.


238
00:11:58.794 --> 00:12:01.829
She has an 80% approval
rating in Alaska.


239
00:12:01.863 --> 00:12:04.900
- The highest of any governor in the country--
- 80%?


240
00:12:04.934 --> 00:12:07.469
And she got it
by taking on the oil lobby


241
00:12:07.503 --> 00:12:09.369
and the republican
establishment.


242
00:12:09.404 --> 00:12:11.072
She's the one who killed
the bridge to nowhere.


243
00:12:11.106 --> 00:12:13.774
I fought Ted
Stevens for months


244
00:12:13.809 --> 00:12:15.376
on that stupid
fucking bridge.


245
00:12:15.411 --> 00:12:17.178
Plus, she is
a devout Christian.


246
00:12:17.212 --> 00:12:19.547
She's got a son about
to deploy to Iraq,


247
00:12:19.582 --> 00:12:21.316
attractive mother of five.

248
00:12:21.350 --> 00:12:24.018
- She likes to moose hunt.
- Moose hunt?


249
00:12:24.052 --> 00:12:25.553
This is a woman
with a gun, John.


250
00:12:25.588 --> 00:12:27.923
I mean, come on, the base is
gonna be doing back flips.


251
00:12:27.957 --> 00:12:29.456
What does salter think?

252
00:12:29.491 --> 00:12:32.393
Uh, he's worried that
she's a creationist.


253
00:12:32.428 --> 00:12:35.264
Yeah, and that's exactly
why the base will love her.


254
00:12:35.297 --> 00:12:36.765
Women will love her.

255
00:12:36.799 --> 00:12:39.268
Plus, she gives you
distance from Bush.


256
00:12:39.302 --> 00:12:41.370
Furthermore,
she's so outside the box


257
00:12:41.404 --> 00:12:44.940
that she helps you
recapture the Maverick label,


258
00:12:44.973 --> 00:12:46.874
which will win back
independents.


259
00:12:46.908 --> 00:12:48.977
She's everything we need.

260
00:12:51.347 --> 00:12:54.049
You don't think she might be
too outside the box?


261
00:12:54.083 --> 00:12:59.121
Huh. Well, that's what makes
her such a Maverick choice.


262
00:12:59.156 --> 00:13:01.222
So is picking Lieberman.

263
00:13:01.257 --> 00:13:03.324
That'd be pretty
goddamn mavericky.


264
00:13:03.359 --> 00:13:05.894
Sir, we live in
the age of YouTube


265
00:13:05.928 --> 00:13:08.230
and the 24-hour news cycle.

266
00:13:08.265 --> 00:13:09.965
How else do you think a man

267
00:13:09.999 --> 00:13:13.235
who has absolutely no
major life accomplishments


268
00:13:13.270 --> 00:13:17.105
is beating an American
hero by double digits?


269
00:13:17.140 --> 00:13:20.642
He's simply sailing on his
charisma and star power.


270
00:13:20.676 --> 00:13:24.946
We need to create a dynamic
moment in this campaign


271
00:13:24.981 --> 00:13:26.482
or we're dead.

272
00:13:26.516 --> 00:13:28.384
You think she's that good?

273
00:13:28.418 --> 00:13:29.618
She could be.

274
00:13:29.653 --> 00:13:31.687
And we can vet her
in five days?


275
00:13:31.721 --> 00:13:33.021
We can.

276
00:13:33.056 --> 00:13:34.956
The vet has to be
as thorough for her


277
00:13:34.991 --> 00:13:37.325
as it was for all
the other candidates.


278
00:13:37.359 --> 00:13:39.695
Culvahouse says
he can do it, so...


279
00:13:39.729 --> 00:13:41.665
The clock is ticking, sir.

280
00:13:41.699 --> 00:13:45.601
If you are going to seriously
consider the governor of Alaska,


281
00:13:45.635 --> 00:13:47.903
you have to call her now.

282
00:13:51.841 --> 00:13:53.641
You know, Governor,
these gas prices


283
00:13:53.676 --> 00:13:56.945
- are killing us.
- Oh, my goodness, don't I know it.


284
00:13:56.979 --> 00:13:58.681
They're killing
me and Todd, too.


285
00:13:58.715 --> 00:14:00.116
Hey, how are ya?

286
00:14:00.150 --> 00:14:02.619
But once Alaska
is allowed to very safely


287
00:14:02.653 --> 00:14:04.486
and responsibly
develop our resources,


288
00:14:04.521 --> 00:14:07.656
we'll lower cost of energy
across the entire nation.


289
00:14:07.691 --> 00:14:09.091
You keep giving
'em hell, Governor.


290
00:14:09.124 --> 00:14:11.026
Aw, thanks.
Nice talking to ya.


291
00:14:11.060 --> 00:14:12.994
Mom, can we go on
the roller coaster now?


292
00:14:13.029 --> 00:14:14.464
Yeah.
No, of course, honey.


293
00:14:14.498 --> 00:14:16.065
- Hey, Bristol?
- Yeah?


294
00:14:16.100 --> 00:14:19.502
Can you hold Trig?
I'm gonna take Piper on the roller coaster.


295
00:14:19.537 --> 00:14:21.869
- Sure.
- There you go.


296
00:14:21.904 --> 00:14:24.739
There you go, buddy.

297
00:14:28.278 --> 00:14:31.948
- Mom.
- Just one second, hon.


298
00:14:31.982 --> 00:14:34.251
This is Sarah.

299
00:14:54.371 --> 00:14:57.606
Thank you for coming on
such short notice, Governor.


300
00:14:57.641 --> 00:14:59.441
Should this go
according to plan,


301
00:14:59.476 --> 00:15:02.478
we will take you to meet
Senator McCain at his compound


302
00:15:02.512 --> 00:15:04.113
first thing in the morning.

303
00:15:04.148 --> 00:15:07.350
Now, if he chooses you
to be his running mate,


304
00:15:07.385 --> 00:15:09.085
you will instantly become

305
00:15:09.119 --> 00:15:11.219
one of the most famous
people on the planet.


306
00:15:11.254 --> 00:15:13.555
Your life will be
investigated,


307
00:15:13.590 --> 00:15:15.090
manipulated, distorted,

308
00:15:15.125 --> 00:15:18.461
and you will lose
any semblance of privacy.


309
00:15:18.496 --> 00:15:21.799
Knowing this,
are you 100% committed


310
00:15:21.833 --> 00:15:24.033
to going forward
with this project?


311
00:15:24.067 --> 00:15:25.602
Absolutely.

312
00:15:25.636 --> 00:15:27.704
I have a servant's heart.

313
00:15:27.738 --> 00:15:29.938
And if you really think
I can help this ticket,


314
00:15:29.972 --> 00:15:32.007
if you really think
I can help this country,


315
00:15:32.041 --> 00:15:34.242
then absolutely--
I'll do this with ya.


316
00:15:34.277 --> 00:15:36.645
Your private life
will be subjected


317
00:15:36.680 --> 00:15:40.149
to harsh,
often unfair attacks.


318
00:15:40.184 --> 00:15:42.551
Nothing can
prepare you for...


319
00:15:42.585 --> 00:15:44.120
How ugly this can be.
Not--


320
00:15:44.154 --> 00:15:47.056
I do understand that.
Here's the deal.


321
00:15:47.090 --> 00:15:49.192
I went through
a tough primary in Alaska,


322
00:15:49.225 --> 00:15:52.061
and I know how ugly
it can get.


323
00:15:53.665 --> 00:15:55.198
Well, Governor,
things can get


324
00:15:55.232 --> 00:15:57.233
quite a bit rougher
on the national stage.


325
00:15:57.267 --> 00:15:59.067
I don't know,
Alaska's pretty rough.


326
00:15:59.102 --> 00:16:02.003
Now, you and
Senator McCain


327
00:16:02.039 --> 00:16:04.840
have a difference of opinion
on several issues.


328
00:16:04.874 --> 00:16:07.343
He is pro-life, but he's
in favor of exceptions


329
00:16:07.377 --> 00:16:10.581
in the case of rape, incest or
a mother's life being at risk.


330
00:16:10.615 --> 00:16:12.516
- You are not.
- That is correct.


331
00:16:12.551 --> 00:16:14.983
I am unapologetically
pro-life.


332
00:16:16.185 --> 00:16:18.721
Senator McCain supports
stem cell research.


333
00:16:18.755 --> 00:16:20.923
- You do not.
- That's true, I do not.


334
00:16:20.958 --> 00:16:24.560
John McCain would never ask you
to contradict your beliefs,


335
00:16:24.594 --> 00:16:28.065
but we expect you
to support his positions.


336
00:16:28.099 --> 00:16:30.333
And we may ask you
to appear in ads


337
00:16:30.368 --> 00:16:33.034
advocating those positions.

338
00:16:33.070 --> 00:16:34.604
Do you have
a problem with that?


339
00:16:34.638 --> 00:16:37.807
No, I don't.
Not at all.


340
00:16:37.842 --> 00:16:41.143
Senator McCain can count
on my full support.


341
00:16:41.178 --> 00:16:44.081
I would be so proud to be
a member of his team.


342
00:16:46.183 --> 00:16:48.818
Do you reject
the theory of evolution?


343
00:16:50.621 --> 00:16:53.356
I'm the daughter
of a science teacher.


344
00:16:53.391 --> 00:16:56.526
My dad showed me
fossils growing up.


345
00:16:56.560 --> 00:16:59.463
I know about evolution.
I accept evolution.


346
00:16:59.497 --> 00:17:03.332
But I will never deny
that I see the hand of God


347
00:17:03.367 --> 00:17:08.706
in this beautiful creation
that is earth.


348
00:17:13.511 --> 00:17:15.144
I'm really glad
that you're asking me


349
00:17:15.178 --> 00:17:17.847
these types of questions.

350
00:17:17.883 --> 00:17:19.348
Why is that?

351
00:17:19.383 --> 00:17:24.221
It's important that you know
exactly what you're getting.


352
00:17:24.255 --> 00:17:26.055
John, let me be very clear.

353
00:17:26.089 --> 00:17:29.492
Every other vet we did was over
a four-to-eight-week period.


354
00:17:29.527 --> 00:17:32.195
This vet has been compiled
in absolute secrecy


355
00:17:32.230 --> 00:17:34.230
in less than five days.

356
00:17:34.264 --> 00:17:35.165
I understand.

357
00:17:35.199 --> 00:17:36.834
Well, in doing
a vet this fast,


358
00:17:36.868 --> 00:17:38.936
there's certainly
the possibility


359
00:17:38.970 --> 00:17:40.638
that we may have
missed something.


360
00:17:40.672 --> 00:17:43.339
Yeah, I got it.
What do you think, A.B.?


361
00:17:43.373 --> 00:17:45.842
I like many of her answers
in the questionnaire.


362
00:17:45.876 --> 00:17:49.278
And in the interview, she hit some
of my questions out of the park.


363
00:17:49.314 --> 00:17:50.647
Now...

364
00:17:50.681 --> 00:17:53.483
There are more potential
land mines with Palin


365
00:17:53.518 --> 00:17:55.686
than with
the other choices.


366
00:17:55.720 --> 00:17:59.022
She told us she has
a teen daughter who's pregnant.


367
00:17:59.057 --> 00:18:01.390
That should not prevent this
from moving forward,


368
00:18:01.425 --> 00:18:04.462
but we don't know
what else could pop up.


369
00:18:04.496 --> 00:18:07.530
But are you impressed
with her personally?


370
00:18:10.802 --> 00:18:13.135
I am.

371
00:18:13.170 --> 00:18:15.172
She has a great
life story


372
00:18:15.205 --> 00:18:18.709
and she's extremely
poised and confident


373
00:18:18.743 --> 00:18:20.611
for someone
in her situation.


374
00:18:21.712 --> 00:18:23.480
But you have a candidate

375
00:18:23.514 --> 00:18:25.382
who's only been governor
for 18 months.


376
00:18:25.416 --> 00:18:27.618
Before that, she was the
mayor of a small town


377
00:18:27.652 --> 00:18:29.787
with 10,000 people.

378
00:18:29.821 --> 00:18:32.556
She undercuts your
best attack on Obama


379
00:18:32.591 --> 00:18:34.625
that he's too inexperienced.

380
00:18:34.659 --> 00:18:36.126
Well, that's played out.

381
00:18:36.160 --> 00:18:38.595
We lose by five if we stick
with experience.


382
00:18:40.865 --> 00:18:43.300
You think she's ready
to be president?


383
00:18:43.334 --> 00:18:46.370
I don't think she's gonna
be ready on January 20th,


384
00:18:46.404 --> 00:18:51.141
but I think she has the smarts
to get there eventually.


385
00:18:53.311 --> 00:18:55.277
Give me
the bottom line, a.B.


386
00:18:55.312 --> 00:18:58.280
High risk...

387
00:18:58.315 --> 00:19:00.417
High reward.

388
00:19:01.887 --> 00:19:03.754
You shouldn't have
told me that.


389
00:19:03.788 --> 00:19:04.889
Why not?

390
00:19:04.923 --> 00:19:09.126
I've been a risk-taker
all my life.


391
00:19:24.009 --> 00:19:25.675
- Hi.
- Hi. How are ya?


392
00:19:25.710 --> 00:19:27.143
Great.

393
00:19:27.177 --> 00:19:28.411
Thanks so much for coming.

394
00:19:28.445 --> 00:19:30.279
Thank you for having me
at your beautiful house.


395
00:19:30.314 --> 00:19:33.883
Well, come on in.
Please.


396
00:19:37.856 --> 00:19:40.356
One of the things
I'm most proud of, Sarah,


397
00:19:40.391 --> 00:19:42.458
is my independence.

398
00:19:42.493 --> 00:19:44.294
And I'm very impressed
with how you've bucked


399
00:19:44.328 --> 00:19:46.730
the republican
establishment in Alaska.


400
00:19:46.765 --> 00:19:49.399
Well, I am wired to be kind
of independent there also.


401
00:19:49.433 --> 00:19:51.735
And I thought if I'm gonna
truly run the state


402
00:19:51.770 --> 00:19:54.038
on behalf of the people,
I'm gonna have to do it


403
00:19:54.071 --> 00:19:56.339
without that good
ole boy network.


404
00:19:56.374 --> 00:19:59.976
I love the way you squashed
Stevens' bridge to nowhere.


405
00:20:00.010 --> 00:20:03.379
Yeah. I am pro-growth

406
00:20:03.414 --> 00:20:05.413
and pro-infrastructure
for Alaska,


407
00:20:05.448 --> 00:20:08.185
but not at the expense
of the American taxpayer.


408
00:20:08.219 --> 00:20:10.220
I told congress
if we wanted a bridge,


409
00:20:10.254 --> 00:20:12.222
we'd build it ourselves.

410
00:20:12.256 --> 00:20:14.724
You remind me of myself.

411
00:20:14.759 --> 00:20:16.460
We're both reformers
who are not afraid


412
00:20:16.494 --> 00:20:18.027
to thumb our nose
at our own party.


413
00:20:18.062 --> 00:20:20.363
Senator, you're
an American hero.


414
00:20:20.398 --> 00:20:24.468
I'm just Sarah
from Alaska.


415
00:20:28.873 --> 00:20:30.941
What do you guys think?

416
00:20:30.976 --> 00:20:33.611
I know a guy
like Tim Pawlenty


417
00:20:33.645 --> 00:20:35.178
isn't exactly
the game-changing pick


418
00:20:35.213 --> 00:20:36.679
you all seem
to think we need,


419
00:20:36.714 --> 00:20:38.180
but he's young,
he's energetic.


420
00:20:38.216 --> 00:20:41.152
He has solid
conservative credentials.


421
00:20:41.185 --> 00:20:43.954
With Pawlenty,
we make the base happy.


422
00:20:43.989 --> 00:20:46.625
And we know what
the hell we're getting.


423
00:20:46.658 --> 00:20:48.358
Pawlenty's ready
to be president.


424
00:20:48.392 --> 00:20:49.995
Steve?

425
00:20:50.028 --> 00:20:53.429
Well, there are
unknowns with Palin,


426
00:20:53.463 --> 00:20:56.701
and certainly
it could go bad.


427
00:20:56.735 --> 00:21:00.203
But if it were me, I'd
rather lose by 10 points


428
00:21:00.238 --> 00:21:02.472
going for the win
than lose by one point


429
00:21:02.508 --> 00:21:04.008
and look back
and say, "God damn,"


430
00:21:04.042 --> 00:21:05.743
we should have gone
for the win."


431
00:21:07.912 --> 00:21:11.015
Our slogan's
"country first."


432
00:21:11.048 --> 00:21:14.618
Lieberman and Pawlenty
are country-first choices.


433
00:21:16.287 --> 00:21:17.855
Sarah Palin
will be perceived


434
00:21:17.889 --> 00:21:20.390
as a self-serving
political maneuver.


435
00:21:23.562 --> 00:21:27.196
You may not only lose
the election, John.


436
00:21:27.231 --> 00:21:29.901
You just might lose your
reputation right along with it.


437
00:21:29.935 --> 00:21:32.771
I'm not running
for my reputation.


438
00:21:33.872 --> 00:21:36.006
I'm running
to be president.


439
00:21:37.175 --> 00:21:38.842
Yes, sir.

440
00:21:47.218 --> 00:21:48.853
It is absolutely crucial

441
00:21:48.888 --> 00:21:50.855
that not a single person
know you're the pick.


442
00:21:50.890 --> 00:21:53.557
Surprise of your announcement
will stop any momentum


443
00:21:53.591 --> 00:21:55.960
Obama might get from
his convention speech.


444
00:21:55.995 --> 00:21:57.627
That's smart.

445
00:22:04.170 --> 00:22:07.338
You seem totally
unfazed by all this.


446
00:22:08.607 --> 00:22:10.842
It's God's plan.

447
00:22:20.920 --> 00:22:24.089
This election has
never been about me.


448
00:22:24.123 --> 00:22:26.357
It's about you.

449
00:22:36.134 --> 00:22:38.636
You understand
that in this election


450
00:22:38.670 --> 00:22:40.206
the greatest risk
we can take


451
00:22:40.239 --> 00:22:42.073
is to try the
same old politics


452
00:22:42.108 --> 00:22:46.510
with the same old players
and expect a different result.


453
00:22:50.348 --> 00:22:53.218
Change happens.

454
00:22:53.251 --> 00:22:56.821
Change happens because the
American people demand it...


455
00:22:58.557 --> 00:23:02.760
Because they rise up and insist
on new ideas and new leadership


456
00:23:02.795 --> 00:23:05.595
and new politics
for a new time.


457
00:23:05.630 --> 00:23:07.697
You're about
to meet our nominee.


458
00:23:07.732 --> 00:23:11.535
You are the seventh and eighth
person to know about this.


459
00:23:11.570 --> 00:23:13.037
It's Steve.

460
00:23:13.072 --> 00:23:15.007
Come in.

461
00:23:15.041 --> 00:23:16.608
Because I've seen it...

462
00:23:16.643 --> 00:23:18.275
Hi. Come on in.

463
00:23:18.310 --> 00:23:21.145
I'm just watching Obama's
big, fancy speech again.


464
00:23:21.179 --> 00:23:23.815
Governor, this is
Matthew Scully.


465
00:23:23.849 --> 00:23:25.549
- He'll be your main speechwriter.
- Nice to meet you.


466
00:23:25.584 --> 00:23:27.252
And this is
Nicolle Wallace,


467
00:23:27.286 --> 00:23:30.689
- former white house communications director.
- Hi. How are you?


468
00:23:30.722 --> 00:23:32.890
And this is
Governor Sarah Palin


469
00:23:32.924 --> 00:23:34.191
from Alaska.

470
00:23:34.226 --> 00:23:37.262
Yes, of course.
Congratulations, Governor.


471
00:23:37.296 --> 00:23:38.762
It's a real honor
to meet you.


472
00:23:38.797 --> 00:23:40.498
Great to have you
on board.


473
00:23:40.532 --> 00:23:42.733
Hey, come here.
Lookit. Look at this.


474
00:23:42.768 --> 00:23:47.072
I didn't know we were
running against a Greek God.


475
00:23:50.642 --> 00:23:53.410
They sure do love him.

476
00:23:53.444 --> 00:23:58.283
- They're gonna love you more.
- America, we cannot turn back.


477
00:24:09.261 --> 00:24:10.862
Governor,
you are the nominee


478
00:24:10.896 --> 00:24:12.697
for the vice president
of the United States.


479
00:24:12.731 --> 00:24:15.499
You will no longer be
carrying your own bags.


480
00:24:15.534 --> 00:24:17.001
Yes, sir.

481
00:24:17.036 --> 00:24:18.804
And never
call me "sir."


482
00:24:18.839 --> 00:24:20.839
You can call me
Steve, Schmidty,


483
00:24:20.873 --> 00:24:24.342
Kojak, potsie, shithead--
anything you want.


484
00:24:24.376 --> 00:24:26.711
I will call you
Governor or ma'am.


485
00:24:26.745 --> 00:24:30.514
Well, I don't curse, so I'm
gonna have to call you potsie.


486
00:24:30.549 --> 00:24:32.250
Very good, ma'am.

487
00:24:32.284 --> 00:24:34.485
These gentlemen are
secret service agents.


488
00:24:34.519 --> 00:24:36.121
They will take you
into the arena.


489
00:24:36.156 --> 00:24:38.122
And if everything goes
according to plan,


490
00:24:38.157 --> 00:24:40.624
they will be with you
the rest of your life.


491
00:24:40.659 --> 00:24:42.693
Everything's gonna change

492
00:24:42.728 --> 00:24:45.230
the moment you
walk out that door.


493
00:24:45.264 --> 00:24:47.298
Are you ready, Governor?

494
00:24:51.136 --> 00:24:53.171
I'm ready.

495
00:24:53.205 --> 00:24:54.839
Breathe.

496
00:24:58.744 --> 00:25:00.345
Welcome, Governor.

497
00:25:17.864 --> 00:25:19.797
Thank you.

498
00:25:19.832 --> 00:25:22.001
Thank you for
that wonderful welcome.


499
00:25:22.035 --> 00:25:25.771
I'm very happy today to
spend my birthday with you


500
00:25:25.805 --> 00:25:29.041
and to make a historic
announcement in Dayton...


501
00:25:30.543 --> 00:25:35.213
...a city built on hard,
honest work of good people.


502
00:25:39.953 --> 00:25:42.020
The person I'm about
to introduce to you


503
00:25:42.055 --> 00:25:45.090
was a stand-out
High School point guard,


504
00:25:45.125 --> 00:25:48.593
a concerned citizen who became
a member of the P.T.A.,


505
00:25:48.628 --> 00:25:50.429
then a city
council member...


506
00:25:50.463 --> 00:25:52.631
- Say a prayer.
- ...Then a mayor,


507
00:25:52.665 --> 00:25:56.267
- and now a governor.
- Say a prayer.


508
00:25:56.303 --> 00:25:58.602
- Say a prayer.
- Say a prayer.


509
00:25:58.637 --> 00:26:01.206
...To celebrate the anniversary
of women's suffrage,


510
00:26:01.241 --> 00:26:04.876
a devoted wife
and a mother of five.


511
00:26:08.815 --> 00:26:11.650
My friends and fellow Americans,

512
00:26:11.684 --> 00:26:13.851
I am very pleased

513
00:26:13.886 --> 00:26:16.755
to introduce to you
the next vice president


514
00:26:16.789 --> 00:26:20.359
of the United States,

515
00:26:20.393 --> 00:26:23.862
Governor Sarah Palin of
the great state of Alaska!


516
00:26:29.368 --> 00:26:31.602
Just have fun.

517
00:26:47.319 --> 00:26:49.488
This is a fantastic
rollout, Steve.


518
00:26:49.523 --> 00:26:51.823
I can't believe you were
able to keep it a secret.


519
00:26:51.858 --> 00:26:55.128
I had to confiscate
her kids' cell phones.


520
00:26:56.596 --> 00:26:58.263
No hurry.

521
00:26:58.299 --> 00:27:00.699
- Thank you.
- All the way, Sarah!


522
00:27:00.733 --> 00:27:02.701
And I thank you,
Senator McCain,


523
00:27:02.734 --> 00:27:05.837
for the confidence
you have placed in me.


524
00:27:05.872 --> 00:27:10.477
Senator, I am honored to be
chosen as your running mate.


525
00:27:13.481 --> 00:27:16.149
It was rightly noted
in Denver this week


526
00:27:16.182 --> 00:27:19.385
that Hillary left

527
00:27:19.419 --> 00:27:23.023
in the highest, hardest
glass ceiling in America.


528
00:27:26.427 --> 00:27:28.427
But it turns out

529
00:27:28.461 --> 00:27:30.663
the women of America
aren't finished yet


530
00:27:30.697 --> 00:27:34.799
and we can shatter that glass
ceiling once and for all.


531
00:27:41.142 --> 00:27:43.376
We gotta get her ready
for her convention speech.


532
00:27:43.411 --> 00:27:45.845
She'll need a vocal coach,
a foreign policy expert,


533
00:27:45.879 --> 00:27:48.081
hair and make-up consultants
and a stylist.


534
00:27:48.115 --> 00:27:49.848
No doubt.

549
00:28:41.801 --> 00:28:44.003
- Nice, dad.
- Mom, you look beautiful.


550
00:28:44.037 --> 00:28:46.907
Aw, hey, look at you.
Look at your fancy shoes.


551
00:28:46.941 --> 00:28:49.175
- You look so awesome, mom.
- Yeah, it really looks good.


552
00:28:49.210 --> 00:28:50.677
- You look great, Willow.
- Thanks.

Okay, if you
all come with me,


556
00:28:55.047 --> 00:28:56.649
it's time for
your campaign photos.


557
00:28:56.683 --> 00:28:59.152
- Bye, mom.
- Okay. Let's go, guys.


558
00:28:59.186 --> 00:29:01.187
- See you in a bit, hon.
- Yeah.


559
00:29:01.222 --> 00:29:03.189
Governor, this is
your new staff--


560
00:29:03.224 --> 00:29:05.992
Tucker Eskew,
senior media advisor.


561
00:29:06.026 --> 00:29:07.628
- It's a pleasure.
- Nice to meet you.


562
00:29:07.661 --> 00:29:09.361
Chris Edwards,
your deputy chief of staff.


563
00:29:09.395 --> 00:29:10.430
- Hi.
- Hi.


564
00:29:10.464 --> 00:29:11.930
And my husband,
Mark Wallace,


565
00:29:11.964 --> 00:29:13.866
former ambassador
to the United Nations.


566
00:29:13.900 --> 00:29:15.368
He'll be a senior advisor.

567
00:29:15.402 --> 00:29:17.336
We're all honored to be
on your team, Governor.


568
00:29:17.370 --> 00:29:20.140
- The honor is all mine.
- Shall we sit?


569
00:29:21.409 --> 00:29:24.411
Well, our first order
of business, Governor,


570
00:29:24.446 --> 00:29:26.946
is we need to find out

571
00:29:26.980 --> 00:29:29.715
if there are any
unexpected surprises.


572
00:29:29.750 --> 00:29:31.917
The press are gonna be
digging deep into your past,


573
00:29:31.952 --> 00:29:36.121
so we need to prepare answers
about your background.


574
00:29:36.156 --> 00:29:37.624
Oh, gosh.

575
00:29:37.658 --> 00:29:41.394
I can't think of anything
I haven't already disclosed.


576
00:29:42.929 --> 00:29:44.497
The Wasilla librarian
claims that as mayor


577
00:29:44.532 --> 00:29:46.299
she tried to ban books.
Is that true?


578
00:29:46.333 --> 00:29:49.401
What about the allegations that
Trig is not really her child?


579
00:29:49.435 --> 00:29:51.836
Did she attend a pentecostal
church where they speak


580
00:29:51.871 --> 00:29:54.005
in tongues?

581
00:29:54.040 --> 00:29:57.109
This source we talked to intimately
involved in Palin's vetting


582
00:29:57.144 --> 00:29:59.145
admitted that aside
from those they talked to


583
00:29:59.180 --> 00:30:00.946
involved in
so-called troopergate,


584
00:30:00.981 --> 00:30:03.650
they didn't talk to any
character witnesses in Alaska--


585
00:30:05.052 --> 00:30:07.152
why was the vet so bad?

586
00:30:07.187 --> 00:30:08.853
Listen, granted,
he only had a few days,


587
00:30:08.888 --> 00:30:10.855
but culvahouse
did clear her.


588
00:30:10.890 --> 00:30:14.194
- Oh, with what? Wikipedia?
- There's no way this vet was thorough.


589
00:30:14.228 --> 00:30:16.163
What? What did he miss?

590
00:30:16.198 --> 00:30:19.199
He had troopergate.
He had bridge to nowhere.


591
00:30:19.233 --> 00:30:21.700
No one went to Alaska to interview
her colleagues, her enemies.


592
00:30:21.734 --> 00:30:23.968
There was no political
vet whatsoever.


593
00:30:24.003 --> 00:30:26.137
These charges
are such bullshit.


594
00:30:26.173 --> 00:30:27.974
I mean,
Trig isn't her baby?


595
00:30:28.008 --> 00:30:30.310
What, speaking in tongues?

596
00:30:30.345 --> 00:30:32.446
- She does.
- I don't care.


597
00:30:32.480 --> 00:30:34.281
Is the first amendment
no longer law here?


598
00:30:34.315 --> 00:30:36.616
Is she not entitled
to her religious beliefs?


599
00:30:36.651 --> 00:30:38.384
You're missing
the point, Rick.


600
00:30:38.419 --> 00:30:41.553
John is getting slammed for
making an irresponsible choice.


601
00:30:41.588 --> 00:30:43.556
- We picked her.
- No, you two picked her,


602
00:30:43.590 --> 00:30:45.593
then slapped her on the butt
and shoved her out there


603
00:30:45.627 --> 00:30:47.994
under a banner
saying "country first!"


604
00:30:48.029 --> 00:30:49.263
You're a real prick, Mark.

605
00:30:49.297 --> 00:30:50.830
- Fuck you, Schmidt!
- Fuck you!


606
00:30:50.864 --> 00:30:53.600
All right, all right!
Let's just get through this.


607
00:30:53.634 --> 00:30:55.067
Come on.

608
00:30:55.102 --> 00:30:56.502
Troopergate. What--?

609
00:30:56.537 --> 00:30:58.137
The Alaska safety commissioner

610
00:30:58.171 --> 00:31:00.806
is claiming that he was fired
because he wouldn't fire


611
00:31:00.840 --> 00:31:03.477
Palin's brother-in-law,
trooper Mike Wooten.


612
00:31:03.511 --> 00:31:06.779
And what were the charges
against trooper Wooten?


613
00:31:06.814 --> 00:31:08.982
Besides the fact that he was
divorcing Palin's sister?


614
00:31:09.016 --> 00:31:12.952
Yes. Do we have any
information that shows


615
00:31:12.986 --> 00:31:15.153
trooper Wooten
should have been fired?


616
00:31:15.188 --> 00:31:17.357
Yeah, Wooten
was accused of drinking


617
00:31:17.391 --> 00:31:19.126
from an open container
from his police car,


618
00:31:19.160 --> 00:31:21.228
tasering his

619
00:31:21.263 --> 00:31:23.497
and illegally shooting
a moose without a permit.


620
00:31:23.530 --> 00:31:24.998
Jesus Christ.

621
00:31:25.032 --> 00:31:27.967
Okay, coordinate all responses
with their Alaskan council.


622
00:31:28.001 --> 00:31:30.069
Let's try to keep it
a local matter.


623
00:31:30.103 --> 00:31:32.472
Bridge to nowhere.
I thought we were good on this.


624
00:31:32.506 --> 00:31:35.142
She had the project squashed
after she was elected,


625
00:31:35.176 --> 00:31:37.745
but ran on a platform
to build the bridge.


626
00:31:37.779 --> 00:31:39.246
It's a huge flip-flop.

627
00:31:39.281 --> 00:31:40.749
God damn it.

628
00:31:40.782 --> 00:31:43.349
How could she
not tell us that?


629
00:31:43.384 --> 00:31:46.286
What the fuck is the Alaska
independence party


630
00:31:46.320 --> 00:31:47.820
and was she ever
a member of it?


631
00:31:47.854 --> 00:31:50.391
The A.I.P. Is a political
party whose sole platform


632
00:31:50.425 --> 00:31:54.027
is the secession of
Alaska from the union.


633
00:31:54.061 --> 00:31:55.496
Well, ain't that a hoot?

634
00:31:55.530 --> 00:31:58.365
Now, was she ever
a member of it?


635
00:32:00.035 --> 00:32:02.235
Well?

636
00:32:02.270 --> 00:32:05.272
We know Todd Palin was
a member for many years.


637
00:32:05.306 --> 00:32:08.141
We can't confirm
if she was ever a member.


638
00:32:08.176 --> 00:32:11.645
Okay. Call our people
in Alaska right now


639
00:32:11.680 --> 00:32:13.214
and find out if she was.

640
00:32:13.248 --> 00:32:15.515
It's 3:00 A.M.
in Alaska right now.


641
00:32:15.550 --> 00:32:17.884
The phones don't
work there at night?!


642
00:32:21.722 --> 00:32:24.691
We're under attack
here, people!


643
00:32:24.725 --> 00:32:26.461
You're gonna have
to raise your game.


644
00:32:26.495 --> 00:32:28.997
I can assure you
that Obama's people


645
00:32:29.032 --> 00:32:30.397
are all over this shit.

646
00:32:30.431 --> 00:32:33.301
In the last 24 hours,
I have been asked questions


647
00:32:33.335 --> 00:32:37.004
by the national media that are
outrageous and disgusting.


648
00:32:37.039 --> 00:32:39.907
I have been asked
when her amniotic fluid


649
00:32:39.942 --> 00:32:42.676
started to leak with regard
to her last birth.


650
00:32:42.711 --> 00:32:44.112
It's shameful.

651
00:32:44.147 --> 00:32:45.780
So when did it
start leaking?


652
00:32:45.815 --> 00:32:47.581
She's fought
the oil companies.


653
00:32:47.615 --> 00:32:50.017
She's taken on corrupt
special interests.


654
00:32:50.052 --> 00:32:52.586
These accusations
are totally sexist.


655
00:32:52.620 --> 00:32:55.223
Never in my life
have I seen a candidate


656
00:32:55.256 --> 00:32:57.691
more attacked by
the liberal media.


657
00:32:57.726 --> 00:33:00.262
Smear after smear
after smear.


658
00:33:00.295 --> 00:33:02.897
Are you sure
we have to do this?


659
00:33:02.898 --> 00:33:04.497
Bristol couldn't stop crying
when I told her.


660
00:33:04.531 --> 00:33:06.067
Are you it's going to we
have come out tomorrow


661
00:33:06.101 --> 00:33:07.568
with or without
our statement, Governor.


662
00:33:07.602 --> 00:33:09.003
A positive from this

663
00:33:09.037 --> 00:33:10.872
is that given the timing
of Bristol's pregnancy,


664
00:33:10.906 --> 00:33:13.841
it makes it physically impossible
for Trig to be her baby.


665
00:33:13.876 --> 00:33:17.846
So we can put that
absurd rumor to rest.


666
00:33:17.880 --> 00:33:20.581
"We're proud of Bristol's
decision to have her baby


667
00:33:20.615 --> 00:33:23.584
and even prouder
to become grandparents."


668
00:33:23.618 --> 00:33:25.052
We're not proud

669
00:33:25.087 --> 00:33:27.922
that our teenage daughter
is pregnant, Maria.


670
00:33:27.956 --> 00:33:30.258
And I don't want to send
a message that teen pregnancy


671
00:33:30.292 --> 00:33:32.393
is something to be proud of.

672
00:33:32.427 --> 00:33:34.195
I want that line out.

673
00:33:34.229 --> 00:33:36.630
Of course, Governor.
I'll change it right away.


674
00:33:38.233 --> 00:33:40.635
Governor Palin's

675
00:33:40.668 --> 00:33:43.737
has been seen holding her baby
brother Trig at campaign events.


676
00:33:43.772 --> 00:33:45.839
What the American people
didn't know until today


677
00:33:45.874 --> 00:33:48.610
is that Bristol
is five months pregnant.


678
00:33:48.644 --> 00:33:50.279
Her parents issued
this statement:


679
00:33:50.313 --> 00:33:52.781
"We're proud of Bristol's
decision to have her baby."


680
00:33:52.815 --> 00:33:54.615
I specifically wanted
that line taken out,


681
00:33:54.649 --> 00:33:56.250
and you ran it
without changing a word.


682
00:33:56.285 --> 00:33:57.518
You're absolutely right.

683
00:33:57.552 --> 00:33:59.820
The campaign takes full
responsibility on this.


684
00:33:59.854 --> 00:34:01.755
Maria's gonna personally
apologize to you.


685
00:34:01.790 --> 00:34:03.424
How the flip
did this happen?


686
00:34:03.458 --> 00:34:05.059
Senator McCain is somewhat

687
00:34:05.093 --> 00:34:07.395
a fly-by-the-seat-
of-his-pants type of guy,


688
00:34:07.430 --> 00:34:09.998
and it does occasionally create
a little chaos in the campaign.


689
00:34:10.033 --> 00:34:11.832
Well, I want Maria gone.

690
00:34:11.866 --> 00:34:14.702
Governor, this was a mistake.
Maria feels terrible.


691
00:34:14.736 --> 00:34:17.338
She's an excellent
press secretary.


692
00:34:17.372 --> 00:34:19.241
My 17-year-old daughter
is being made fun of


693
00:34:19.275 --> 00:34:20.943
by every talk show host
in the country.


694
00:34:20.977 --> 00:34:24.045
I want Maria gone, period.

695
00:34:24.079 --> 00:34:27.249
Of course, Governor.
She's gone.


696
00:34:27.283 --> 00:34:29.418
Done.

697
00:34:31.586 --> 00:34:33.055
Who makes that call?

698
00:34:33.089 --> 00:34:35.389
That'd be you.

699
00:34:35.424 --> 00:34:38.391
The idea that if something
happened to John McCain


700
00:34:38.426 --> 00:34:41.896
who is 72 years old and who has
had two bouts with melanoma,


701
00:34:41.931 --> 00:34:44.032
and she could step
into the presidency--


702
00:34:44.067 --> 00:34:45.532
It's just ridiculous.

703
00:34:45.568 --> 00:34:47.035
The real sequence, Rachel,

704
00:34:47.070 --> 00:34:49.703
is she said "please"
and "thank you,"


705
00:34:49.737 --> 00:34:52.239
and then "thanks,
but no thanks,"


706
00:34:52.275 --> 00:34:56.810
only when the congress
had de-authorized the bridge...


707
00:34:56.845 --> 00:34:59.314
Hi, Governor.
I just wanted to check in,


708
00:34:59.348 --> 00:35:01.882
make sure
you're doing okay.


709
00:35:01.917 --> 00:35:04.019
Should John McCain consider
replacing Sarah Palin


710
00:35:04.053 --> 00:35:05.854
on the GOP ticket?

711
00:35:05.888 --> 00:35:07.356
I want to talk
to the press.


712
00:35:07.390 --> 00:35:10.057
I want to set the record
straight on this stuff.


713
00:35:11.193 --> 00:35:13.996
I'll just go put
Trig's P.J's on.


714
00:35:14.030 --> 00:35:15.563
Hey, there.

715
00:35:15.598 --> 00:35:18.266
- There you go, baby.
- Just gonna put your PJ's on.


716
00:35:18.301 --> 00:35:21.136
Now, we don't want you
to talk to anyone


717
00:35:21.170 --> 00:35:24.606
until after
the convention


718
00:35:24.640 --> 00:35:28.109
because no one knows
anything about you.


719
00:35:28.143 --> 00:35:30.778
If you answer these
ridiculous allegations,


720
00:35:30.814 --> 00:35:35.051
you'll be defining yourself
in a defensive posture.


721
00:35:35.084 --> 00:35:36.818
But isn't the press
defining me right now?


722
00:35:36.852 --> 00:35:40.890
No news story lasts
more than 48 hours any more.


723
00:35:40.924 --> 00:35:43.224
News is no longer
meant to be remembered.


724
00:35:43.258 --> 00:35:44.659
It's just entertainment.

725
00:35:44.693 --> 00:35:47.762
So if you hit your convention
speech out of the park,


726
00:35:47.796 --> 00:35:52.767
the next news cycle will be
the comeback of Sarah Palin.


727
00:35:52.801 --> 00:35:55.737
Yeah. I can do that.

728
00:35:55.771 --> 00:35:59.341
Now, everyone's heard a lot
of crazy stories about you.


729
00:35:59.375 --> 00:36:02.677
Now it's time for you to tell
the world who you really are.


730
00:36:02.711 --> 00:36:07.516
You tell Senator McCain
I won't let him down.


731
00:36:07.550 --> 00:36:10.786
And good evening from the G.O.P.
Convention in St. Paul.


732
00:36:10.820 --> 00:36:12.788
All eyes will be
on Senator McCain's


733
00:36:12.822 --> 00:36:15.089
V.P. Choice,
Governor Sarah Palin,


734
00:36:15.123 --> 00:36:17.125
when she takes the stage
at the R.N.C.


735
00:36:17.159 --> 00:36:19.127
She's likely
never seen a night


736
00:36:19.162 --> 00:36:21.063
fraught with
so much anticipation,


737
00:36:21.097 --> 00:36:23.199
expectation and pressure.

738
00:36:24.733 --> 00:36:27.769
The food's terrible, but I hear
it's gonna be worse in Iraq.


739
00:36:27.803 --> 00:36:31.706
- My boy's so brave.
- Come on, mom.


740
00:36:35.811 --> 00:36:37.980
Thank you for inviting me,
Mrs. Palin.


741
00:36:38.014 --> 00:36:40.149
Thank you for cutting
your mullet, Levi.


742
00:36:40.184 --> 00:36:41.917
I really appreciate it.

743
00:36:41.952 --> 00:36:43.586
I didn't really
want to at first,


744
00:36:43.620 --> 00:36:46.521
but I think it looks
way better now.


745
00:36:46.556 --> 00:36:49.924
I think it does, too.

746
00:36:51.727 --> 00:36:53.295
Sorry to interrupt,

747
00:36:53.328 --> 00:36:55.998
but the palins need
to go to their seats.


748
00:36:56.032 --> 00:36:58.067
- Bye, mom.
- Okay.


749
00:37:06.709 --> 00:37:09.411
I don't know.
I don't know.


750
00:37:09.445 --> 00:37:11.447
Hey, she's gonna
be fine.


751
00:37:11.482 --> 00:37:14.283
- Really?
- Absolutely.


752
00:37:16.153 --> 00:37:17.687
Is she gonna be okay?

753
00:37:17.722 --> 00:37:20.455
I'm more concerned
about one on ones.


754
00:37:20.490 --> 00:37:21.924
How bad?

755
00:37:21.957 --> 00:37:25.160
I'm not sure how much she
knows about foreign policy.


756
00:37:25.194 --> 00:37:27.763
She didn't know why North and South
Korea were different countries.


757
00:37:29.633 --> 00:37:32.402
Okay, let's keep
the press away from her.


758
00:37:32.437 --> 00:37:34.603
We have five days
to bring her up to speed.


759
00:37:34.637 --> 00:37:36.070
She'll be fine.

760
00:37:36.105 --> 00:37:38.106
She's on in five minutes.
I've gotta get up there.


761
00:37:38.141 --> 00:37:39.741
Good luck.

762
00:37:39.775 --> 00:37:41.976
In choosing
Governor Sarah Palin


763
00:37:42.012 --> 00:37:45.482
as his running mate,
John McCain has chosen


764
00:37:45.516 --> 00:37:48.083
for the future.

765
00:37:48.118 --> 00:37:52.654
Governor Palin represents
a new generation.


766
00:37:52.688 --> 00:37:55.558
She's already one of the
most successful governors


767
00:37:55.591 --> 00:37:59.127
in America
and the most popular.


768
00:38:02.133 --> 00:38:05.969
Let's get John McCain
and Sarah Palin elected,


769
00:38:06.003 --> 00:38:08.303
and let's shake up
Washington


770
00:38:08.337 --> 00:38:11.306
and move
this country forward!


771
00:38:13.043 --> 00:38:15.443
You're gonna do great.

772
00:38:17.580 --> 00:38:19.749
Ladies and gentlemen,

773
00:38:19.784 --> 00:38:21.818
the Governor of Alaska

774
00:38:21.852 --> 00:38:26.121
and the next vice president
of the United States,


775
00:38:26.156 --> 00:38:29.291
Sarah Palin!

776
00:38:45.375 --> 00:38:48.311
Thank you.

777
00:38:48.345 --> 00:38:52.014
Mr. chairman, delegates,

778
00:38:52.049 --> 00:38:54.651
and fellow citizens,

779
00:38:54.686 --> 00:38:57.320
I will be honored to
accept your nomination


780
00:38:57.354 --> 00:39:01.257
for vice president
of the United States.


781
00:39:07.865 --> 00:39:09.734
Thank you.

782
00:39:14.071 --> 00:39:16.873
Our nominee is a man

783
00:39:16.907 --> 00:39:20.409
who wore the uniform
of his country for 22 years


784
00:39:20.444 --> 00:39:24.380
and refused to break faith
with those troops in Iraq


785
00:39:24.414 --> 00:39:27.618
who now have brought
victory within sight.


786
00:39:27.652 --> 00:39:30.554
Good, good.
She's really good.


787
00:39:30.588 --> 00:39:33.090
We were so blessed
in April.


788
00:39:33.125 --> 00:39:35.958
Todd and I welcomed
our littlest one


789
00:39:35.993 --> 00:39:37.660
into the world--

790
00:39:37.694 --> 00:39:43.066
a perfectly beautiful
baby boy named Trig.


791
00:39:44.969 --> 00:39:46.637
Children with special needs

792
00:39:46.670 --> 00:39:50.172
inspire a very,
very special love.


793
00:39:52.575 --> 00:39:55.044
She's amazing.

794
00:39:55.078 --> 00:39:57.646
To the families of
special needs children


795
00:39:57.680 --> 00:40:02.052
all across this country,
I have a message for you.


796
00:40:02.087 --> 00:40:04.754
I pledge to you
that if we are elected,


797
00:40:04.789 --> 00:40:09.225
you will have a friend and
advocate in the White House.


798
00:40:09.260 --> 00:40:10.960
She's incredible!

799
00:40:12.163 --> 00:40:14.096
Before I became governor

800
00:40:14.131 --> 00:40:17.366
of the great state
of Alaska...


801
00:40:18.770 --> 00:40:22.505
I was mayor of my hometown.

802
00:40:22.539 --> 00:40:25.373
I guess a small-town mayor

803
00:40:25.408 --> 00:40:29.913
is sort of like
a community organizer.


804
00:40:29.947 --> 00:40:34.985
Except that you have
actual responsibilities.


805
00:40:37.522 --> 00:40:40.023
Now I know why they
call her "Sarah barracuda."


806
00:40:42.492 --> 00:40:45.829
I love those hockey moms.

807
00:40:45.863 --> 00:40:47.063
You know they say
the difference


808
00:40:47.097 --> 00:40:48.998
between a hockey mom
and a pit bull?


809
00:40:49.033 --> 00:40:50.500
Lipstick.

810
00:40:50.535 --> 00:40:52.136
Yeah!

811
00:40:52.170 --> 00:40:54.204
She just came up
with that.


812
00:40:54.238 --> 00:40:57.373
Join our cause
and help America


813
00:40:57.407 --> 00:41:01.244
elect a great man
as the next president


814
00:41:01.278 --> 00:41:03.546
of the United States.

815
00:41:04.982 --> 00:41:06.482
Thank you.

816
00:41:06.518 --> 00:41:08.886
And God bless America.

817
00:41:08.920 --> 00:41:11.221
- Great job! You did a great job!
- Couldn't have gone better.


818
00:41:11.255 --> 00:41:13.489
- Congratulations.
- My God!


819
00:41:13.523 --> 00:41:14.991
She did it without
a teleprompter.


820
00:41:15.025 --> 00:41:16.492
It broke halfway
through her speech.


821
00:41:16.526 --> 00:41:17.828
- You're kidding.
- No.


822
00:41:17.863 --> 00:41:20.030
If that happens to me
tomorrow night, I'm fucked.


823
00:41:24.136 --> 00:41:25.470
We can win this!

Thank you for calling.
Yes, we do take credit cards.


831
00:41:44.222 --> 00:41:46.689
- I'd be happy to...
- I've got $500.


832
00:41:46.724 --> 00:41:49.293
We're grateful for
every dollar we get.


833
00:41:49.327 --> 00:41:52.061
Yes, Sarah Palin will be giving
a speech in Florida this week.


834
00:41:52.096 --> 00:41:53.931
Thanks.

835
00:41:53.965 --> 00:41:56.232
Hey. Here we go.

836
00:41:56.267 --> 00:41:58.135
- Thanks for coming.
- I love you.


837
00:41:58.169 --> 00:42:02.205
Hi. Hey. Hi.

838
00:42:02.240 --> 00:42:05.074
- God, this is crazy.
- I know, they really love her.


839
00:42:06.644 --> 00:42:09.179
How are ya? Hey.

840
00:42:10.615 --> 00:42:12.283
- Hey, what's your name?
- I'm Sarah.


841
00:42:12.317 --> 00:42:13.851
- Sarah?
- Yeah.


842
00:42:13.885 --> 00:42:16.486
That's my name, too.
That's amazing!


843
00:42:16.521 --> 00:42:18.389
- I know.
- Oh!


844
00:42:18.423 --> 00:42:19.623
Hey, thanks for coming out.

845
00:42:19.657 --> 00:42:21.691
Thank you.
We never felt welcome to go anywhere


846
00:42:21.726 --> 00:42:23.559
before we saw you
give that speech.


847
00:42:23.593 --> 00:42:26.063
Oh, thank you.
Thanks so much.


848
00:42:26.096 --> 00:42:28.465
Look at you.
I want to look at how handsome


849
00:42:28.499 --> 00:42:31.068
my son Trig's gonna be
when he's all grown up.


850
00:42:31.102 --> 00:42:33.971
She understands that you can't
solve problems with government,


851
00:42:34.005 --> 00:42:35.639
that government
is the problem.


852
00:42:35.673 --> 00:42:38.809
When she talks about her faith,
you can tell it's for real.


853
00:42:38.843 --> 00:42:41.946
When she talks about guns,
you can tell it's for real.


854
00:42:41.980 --> 00:42:43.680
I've got five kids, too,

855
00:42:43.715 --> 00:42:45.215
and there's
something about her--


856
00:42:45.250 --> 00:42:48.585
she's talking to me.
And nobody talks to me.


857
00:42:51.957 --> 00:42:54.291
CNN has us even
with Obama.


858
00:42:54.326 --> 00:42:57.227
- Are you kidding me?
- Hey, Gallup has us up by five.


859
00:42:57.262 --> 00:42:58.963
She's given us
exactly what we needed.


860
00:42:58.997 --> 00:43:00.864
We've made more money
in the last few days


861
00:43:00.899 --> 00:43:02.298
than we did
all last month.


862
00:43:02.333 --> 00:43:04.401
I've never seen crowds
like this in my life.


863
00:43:04.436 --> 00:43:07.471
- They love her.
- She's a bigger star than Obama.


864
00:43:07.505 --> 00:43:09.906
We can really
win this thing.


865
00:43:16.314 --> 00:43:18.047
I really understand
your frustr--


866
00:43:18.083 --> 00:43:19.883
I'm sorry, Pool.
It's not gonna happen today.


867
00:43:19.917 --> 00:43:21.453
Sorry.

868
00:43:21.487 --> 00:43:23.588
- Five minutes!
- Views matter.


869
00:43:23.622 --> 00:43:26.390
Did you know that
Todd Palin is an Eskimo?


870
00:43:26.424 --> 00:43:28.892
Oh, yeah, Steve?
That's really interesting.


871
00:43:28.926 --> 00:43:31.828
Seriously,
he's a Yupik Eskimo.


872
00:43:31.863 --> 00:43:33.731
We're gonna take some serious
blowback from the press


873
00:43:33.765 --> 00:43:35.432
if we don't let them
speak to her soon.


874
00:43:35.467 --> 00:43:37.869
- They're really getting pissed.
- I know, yeah.


875
00:43:37.903 --> 00:43:39.937
Well, I don't know
how ready she is.


876
00:43:39.972 --> 00:43:42.440
Nicolle,
you worry too much.


877
00:43:42.475 --> 00:43:44.875
We always knew she'd
be weak on foreign policy.


878
00:43:44.910 --> 00:43:46.443
We'll get her up to speed.

879
00:43:46.478 --> 00:43:50.415
Steve, I don't think foreign
policy is her only weakness.


880
00:43:53.719 --> 00:43:55.854
Sorry to bother you, governor.
Now, is it Okay time to talk?


881
00:43:55.889 --> 00:43:58.490
Sure, I'm just reading the e-mails
from the prayer warriors.


882
00:43:58.525 --> 00:44:00.391
These guys are awesome.

883
00:44:00.426 --> 00:44:02.828
I just want to take
a moment to inform you


884
00:44:02.861 --> 00:44:05.796
of how thrilled
Senator McCain is.


885
00:44:05.831 --> 00:44:08.499
You're exceeding
his wildest expectation


886
00:44:08.534 --> 00:44:10.267
for what a running mate
could achieve.


887
00:44:10.301 --> 00:44:12.370
I am so happy to hear that.

888
00:44:12.405 --> 00:44:14.773
These are the largest crowds
I've ever seen


889
00:44:14.807 --> 00:44:17.009
in my entire
political career, ever.


890
00:44:17.043 --> 00:44:18.577
Really? Yeah, I just--

891
00:44:18.611 --> 00:44:21.112
I just love talking
to people on the rope lines,


892
00:44:21.147 --> 00:44:22.680
getting to hear
their problems.


893
00:44:22.714 --> 00:44:25.082
It's-- it's really
moving to me.


894
00:44:25.116 --> 00:44:26.918
Well, you know,
that comes across.


895
00:44:26.952 --> 00:44:29.287
You're a transformative
figure, Governor.


896
00:44:29.322 --> 00:44:32.758
You-- you could be the
party's next Ronald Reagan.


897
00:44:32.792 --> 00:44:35.260
Holy jeez, I--

898
00:44:35.294 --> 00:44:38.263
yeah, he's--
he's my hero, so...


899
00:44:38.297 --> 00:44:41.199
Mine, too.
So, uh...


900
00:44:41.233 --> 00:44:44.602
The next step is just-- we're gonna
start doing some interviews.


901
00:44:44.636 --> 00:44:46.705
Great. I've been dying
to talk to the press.


902
00:44:46.739 --> 00:44:49.208
Also, I feel like I could
really help you there.


903
00:44:49.242 --> 00:44:52.644
I've always been very, very
open with the press in Alaska.


904
00:44:52.679 --> 00:44:54.813
The reasoning behind
holding you back


905
00:44:54.847 --> 00:44:57.450
is the entire press corps
is in the tank for Obama,


906
00:44:57.484 --> 00:44:58.883
so all they want in life

907
00:44:58.917 --> 00:45:01.253
is to trip you up
with obscure questions.


908
00:45:01.288 --> 00:45:03.155
- Gotcha questions.
- Gotcha questions.


909
00:45:03.190 --> 00:45:05.091
So we just want to make sure
you're fully prepped


910
00:45:05.125 --> 00:45:06.792
before we unleash them.

911
00:45:06.826 --> 00:45:08.795
What about the local
Alaska papers?


912
00:45:08.829 --> 00:45:10.696
There are no
local papers any more.


913
00:45:10.730 --> 00:45:14.065
Anything you say goes national
the instant you say it.


914
00:45:14.100 --> 00:45:15.266
Yeah, got it.

915
00:45:15.301 --> 00:45:18.404
Okay, so I think
the best way to prep


916
00:45:18.438 --> 00:45:20.640
would just be to go through
some sample questions.


917
00:45:20.673 --> 00:45:22.142
Sure, let's do it.

918
00:45:22.176 --> 00:45:25.078
Um, let's start with
something simple.


919
00:45:25.113 --> 00:45:28.447
Uh... how do you
plan on maintaining


920
00:45:28.482 --> 00:45:31.049
our alliance with
greabrbritain on Iraq,


921
00:45:31.084 --> 00:45:33.051
even though support
for the war there


922
00:45:33.086 --> 00:45:34.586
is at an all-time low?

923
00:45:34.620 --> 00:45:39.092
I think the United States
has always maintained


924
00:45:39.127 --> 00:45:40.693
a great relationship
with the Queen.


925
00:45:40.728 --> 00:45:43.461
And John McCain
will continue to have


926
00:45:43.497 --> 00:45:45.563
an open dialogue with her.

927
00:45:46.433 --> 00:45:47.833
Uh, Governor,

928
00:45:47.867 --> 00:45:50.869
the Queen is not the head
of government in England.


929
00:45:50.903 --> 00:45:52.372
She's the head of state.

930
00:45:52.406 --> 00:45:54.974
Well, then, who's
the head of government?


931
00:45:56.144 --> 00:45:58.178
The Prime Minister.

932
00:46:19.999 --> 00:46:21.400
You rang?

933
00:46:21.434 --> 00:46:23.769
The cavalry has arrived.

934
00:46:23.803 --> 00:46:26.105
- Thank you, gentlemen. Come on in.
- You bet.


935
00:46:26.140 --> 00:46:27.740
Yeah.

936
00:46:35.815 --> 00:46:37.683
Well, I, uh--

937
00:46:37.717 --> 00:46:39.618
I think we should start
by prepping the governor


938
00:46:39.654 --> 00:46:41.853
with Russian
economic policy


939
00:46:41.888 --> 00:46:44.591
as it relates to
post-cold war tensions


940
00:46:44.625 --> 00:46:46.226
during the pre
-Putin era.

941
00:46:46.260 --> 00:46:49.595
I was thinking something
a little bit simpler.


942
00:46:49.629 --> 00:46:50.830
How much simpler?

943
00:46:50.864 --> 00:46:53.265
This is Germany.

944
00:46:53.300 --> 00:46:55.703
They were
the primary antagonists


945
00:46:55.736 --> 00:46:58.004
during World War I
and World War II.


946
00:46:58.038 --> 00:47:00.208
And in World War II,
they were aligned with


947
00:47:00.242 --> 00:47:04.711
Japan and Italy to form
what was known as the axis.


948
00:47:08.548 --> 00:47:10.017
Currently,
we're in the middle, okay.


949
00:47:10.050 --> 00:47:12.352
Of what I like to call
the three wars.


950
00:47:12.386 --> 00:47:16.857
That's Afghanistan, Iraq,
and the global war on terror.


951
00:47:16.891 --> 00:47:20.493
Governor, would you-- would
you like to take a break?


952
00:47:20.528 --> 00:47:23.930
No way.
This is flippin' awesome.


953
00:47:28.002 --> 00:47:31.004
Now, with Afghanistan,
after 9/11...


954
00:47:31.039 --> 00:47:33.273
...Already put
a protective wall up


955
00:47:33.308 --> 00:47:36.076
around the family,
especially the key players.


956
00:47:36.110 --> 00:47:39.511
Look at Bristol, Sarah Palin's
daughter, who is pregnant.


957
00:47:39.546 --> 00:47:43.617
We've seen her, we've seen her boyfriend
Levi, the father of her child,


958
00:47:43.651 --> 00:47:45.753
but we haven't really
gotten to talk to them


959
00:47:45.786 --> 00:47:47.954
about whose idea
it was to get married


960
00:47:47.989 --> 00:47:50.691
and why, for example,
Levi on his MySpace page


961
00:47:50.726 --> 00:47:52.893
- says he doesn't want kids--
- That isn't anybody's--


962
00:47:52.927 --> 00:47:56.296
Why won't they
just leave me alone?


963
00:47:56.329 --> 00:47:59.733
I'm so tired of it.

964
00:47:59.768 --> 00:48:02.435
Any grown up who makes
fun of a teenage girl


965
00:48:02.470 --> 00:48:04.171
is a terrible person.

966
00:48:04.205 --> 00:48:06.306
And we'll forget what
she said, honey, okay?


967
00:48:06.340 --> 00:48:07.908
Okay?

968
00:48:07.942 --> 00:48:10.443
My e-mails were hacked.

969
00:48:10.478 --> 00:48:13.013
I know, governor, and we're on it.
I promise you.


970
00:48:13.047 --> 00:48:14.648
Did you know that
my daughter's cell phone


971
00:48:14.682 --> 00:48:16.716
is online and she's
getting crank calls?


972
00:48:16.751 --> 00:48:21.021
Did you know that my family
is being threatened?


973
00:48:21.055 --> 00:48:24.624
Governor, you have every right
to be upset, and I am sorry.


974
00:48:24.659 --> 00:48:27.094
I've already contacted
secret service


975
00:48:27.128 --> 00:48:28.929
and they're gonna
increase security.


976
00:48:28.963 --> 00:48:31.665
Can you-- can you
protect my e-mails, Steve?


977
00:48:31.699 --> 00:48:34.668
Can you--
can this campaign


978
00:48:34.702 --> 00:48:36.604
at least do that?

979
00:48:42.743 --> 00:48:44.245
Charlie Gibson is good,

980
00:48:44.279 --> 00:48:46.880
so I'm sure the questions
will have some depth.


981
00:48:46.915 --> 00:48:49.284
Don't be afraid to elaborate
if it's a subject


982
00:48:49.317 --> 00:48:51.286
you feel comfortable with,
like energy.


983
00:48:53.554 --> 00:48:55.322
Are you okay, Governor?

984
00:48:55.356 --> 00:48:59.459
Why aren't there any McCain-Palin
lawn signs in Alaska?


985
00:48:59.493 --> 00:49:02.330
Well, Mr. Obama

986
00:49:02.363 --> 00:49:04.398
has five times
the money we have.


987
00:49:04.433 --> 00:49:07.202
Five times, and...

988
00:49:07.236 --> 00:49:11.172
Alaska is only three electoral
votes, and it's solid red.


989
00:49:11.206 --> 00:49:13.273
I'm concerned about
my standing back home.


990
00:49:13.307 --> 00:49:14.775
Todd and I
are hearing things,


991
00:49:14.810 --> 00:49:17.011
and I can't talk
to the Alaskan press.


992
00:49:17.046 --> 00:49:18.512
What are you hearing?

993
00:49:18.547 --> 00:49:20.581
Things.
None of it's good.


994
00:49:20.615 --> 00:49:23.985
Can you at least do a poll to
check my approval rating there?


995
00:49:24.019 --> 00:49:26.921
Governor, that would cost
the campaign $60,000.


996
00:49:26.956 --> 00:49:28.989
I'd feel a heck
of a lot better


997
00:49:29.023 --> 00:49:31.326
if I knew where I was at.

998
00:49:33.262 --> 00:49:35.763
Absolutely.
We will do the poll


999
00:49:35.797 --> 00:49:37.697
for your peace of mind,
just this once.


1000
00:49:37.732 --> 00:49:39.233
Great. Thank you.

1001
00:49:39.267 --> 00:49:41.569
So, can we get back to
prepping Charlie Gibson?


1002
00:49:41.603 --> 00:49:43.070
Sure, I'm ready.
Let's do it.


1003
00:49:43.104 --> 00:49:45.773
- You ready?
- Yes.


1004
00:49:47.542 --> 00:49:49.344
Do you think the Fed
did the right thing


1005
00:49:49.379 --> 00:49:51.345
in their dealing with
the Bear Stearns collapse?


1006
00:49:52.848 --> 00:49:56.350
Our economy is hurting,
and the federal government


1007
00:49:56.385 --> 00:49:58.318
has not provided
the sound oversight


1008
00:49:58.353 --> 00:50:00.788
that we need
and that we deserve.


1009
00:50:00.822 --> 00:50:04.158
I think we need
a little bit of reality


1010
00:50:04.192 --> 00:50:05.794
from Wasilla
main street there


1011
00:50:05.828 --> 00:50:09.631
brought to Washington, D.C.,
so that the people there


1012
00:50:09.664 --> 00:50:13.534
can understand how the
average working-class family


1013
00:50:13.568 --> 00:50:16.604
is viewing bureaucracy
in the federal government.


1014
00:50:16.638 --> 00:50:18.672
Governor...

1015
00:50:18.707 --> 00:50:20.340
Do you know
what the Fed is?


1016
00:50:22.744 --> 00:50:24.111
In what respect, Charlie?

1017
00:50:24.145 --> 00:50:26.514
No, no.
This is me, Steve,


1018
00:50:26.548 --> 00:50:28.917
asking do you know
what the Fed is?


1019
00:50:33.989 --> 00:50:36.090
Um...

1020
00:50:36.125 --> 00:50:38.859
Stands for the federal
reserve system.


1021
00:50:38.894 --> 00:50:41.361
No, please.
Don't write, just listen.


1022
00:50:41.396 --> 00:50:44.732
The Fed is responsible
for all monetary policy


1023
00:50:44.766 --> 00:50:46.234
in the United States.

1024
00:50:46.267 --> 00:50:48.101
On any Fed or
Bear Stearns question,


1025
00:50:48.136 --> 00:50:49.670
just say the Fed took
the appropriate action


1026
00:50:49.704 --> 00:50:52.441
that was needed
at the time.


1027
00:50:52.475 --> 00:50:54.042
Okay?

1028
00:50:56.646 --> 00:50:58.379
Got it.

1029
00:51:01.082 --> 00:51:04.218
Your oldest son is proudly
heading off to Iraq next week.


1030
00:51:04.253 --> 00:51:07.221
Who do you see as the primary
enemy at this point?


1031
00:51:07.256 --> 00:51:10.425
Radical islamist extremists.

1032
00:51:10.459 --> 00:51:12.060
Can you be more specific?

1033
00:51:12.094 --> 00:51:14.262
The terrorists
who are hell-bent


1034
00:51:14.296 --> 00:51:16.465
on destroying our nation.

1035
00:51:16.499 --> 00:51:18.265
Governor, do you know
why we're in Iraq?


1036
00:51:18.299 --> 00:51:22.370
Because Saddam Hussein
attacked us on 9/11.


1037
00:51:22.404 --> 00:51:24.873
No. No, uh,

1038
00:51:24.907 --> 00:51:27.040
Al-Qaeda attacked us
on 9/11.


1039
00:51:27.074 --> 00:51:28.577
Not Saddam Hussein.

1040
00:51:28.611 --> 00:51:30.244
No, it was Al
-Qaeda.

1041
00:51:30.279 --> 00:51:32.614
And that's why
we're in Afghanistan.


1042
00:51:32.648 --> 00:51:34.616
Do you know
the primary differences


1043
00:51:34.649 --> 00:51:36.985
between the war in Afghanistan
and the war in Iraq?


1044
00:51:40.322 --> 00:51:44.658
Um, excuse
us for a moment.


1045
00:51:52.568 --> 00:51:54.970
Can I get some more information
about Afghanistan?


1046
00:51:55.004 --> 00:51:56.906
Of course, Governor.

1047
00:52:06.916 --> 00:52:09.051
- Should we cancel?
- We can't.


1048
00:52:09.085 --> 00:52:11.153
Even FOX is pounding us
for hiding her.


1049
00:52:11.187 --> 00:52:13.689
- We'd get murdered.
- When you interviewed her,


1050
00:52:13.724 --> 00:52:15.757
didn't you ask her
about national security?


1051
00:52:15.791 --> 00:52:18.960
Foreign policy,
domestic policy?


1052
00:52:18.995 --> 00:52:20.796
I thought culvahouse
would cover that.


1053
00:52:20.831 --> 00:52:22.631
So what did you ask her?

1054
00:52:22.665 --> 00:52:26.167
I just-- we talked
about if she would


1055
00:52:26.201 --> 00:52:29.204
back John's positions
when they conflicted with hers


1056
00:52:29.239 --> 00:52:31.572
or if she was prepared
for her life to change.


1057
00:52:31.573 --> 00:52:34.107
There were no
policy questions.


1058
00:52:34.142 --> 00:52:37.846
You guys didn't grill her
because you wanted it to work.


1059
00:52:37.880 --> 00:52:40.715
I wasn't in charge
of the vet, Nicolle.


1060
00:52:46.288 --> 00:52:47.955
She's a great actress, right?

1061
00:52:47.989 --> 00:52:50.291
Oh, the best.

1062
00:52:50.325 --> 00:52:53.128
Why don't we just
give her some lines?


1063
00:52:59.301 --> 00:53:01.003
I've come up with
a list of questions


1064
00:53:01.038 --> 00:53:02.837
that I think Charlie's
most likely to ask.


1065
00:53:02.872 --> 00:53:04.271
If you memorize
these answers,


1066
00:53:04.305 --> 00:53:06.006
I'm sure you're going
to nail this interview.


1067
00:53:06.042 --> 00:53:07.542
How do you know
he'll ask these?


1068
00:53:07.577 --> 00:53:09.010
I was the White House
communications director.


1069
00:53:09.045 --> 00:53:11.313
It's my job to figure out
the questions.


1070
00:53:11.347 --> 00:53:12.714
"Shushkashvili."

1071
00:53:12.749 --> 00:53:15.117
Saakashvili,
the president of Georgia.


1072
00:53:15.151 --> 00:53:16.851
Shashkashvili.

1073
00:53:16.886 --> 00:53:18.954
Saakashvith--

1074
00:53:18.987 --> 00:53:21.623
- Saakashvili.
- Saakash-vili.


1075
00:53:21.657 --> 00:53:23.491
Let me ask you
about some specific


1076
00:53:23.525 --> 00:53:25.259
- national security situations.
- Sure.


1077
00:53:25.293 --> 00:53:27.096
Let's start with Russia
and Georgia.


1078
00:53:27.130 --> 00:53:29.164
Do you believe
the United States


1079
00:53:29.199 --> 00:53:31.834
should try to restore
Georgian sovereignty


1080
00:53:31.868 --> 00:53:33.903
over South Ossetia
and Abkhazia?


1081
00:53:33.937 --> 00:53:35.403
First off,
we're gonna continue


1082
00:53:35.437 --> 00:53:36.871
good relations
with Saakashvili there.


1083
00:53:36.906 --> 00:53:39.474
I was able to speak
with him the other day,


1084
00:53:39.508 --> 00:53:41.710
and we've gotta
keep an eye on Russia.


1085
00:53:41.744 --> 00:53:44.146
For Russia to have
exerted such pressure


1086
00:53:44.181 --> 00:53:48.785
in terms of invading a smaller
Democratic country unprovoked


1087
00:53:48.820 --> 00:53:51.086
- is unacceptable, and we have--
- You believe unprovoked?


1088
00:53:51.120 --> 00:53:53.521
- Yes.
- I do, I do believe unprovoked.


1089
00:53:53.555 --> 00:53:55.223
And we have to
keep our eye...


1090
00:53:55.257 --> 00:53:56.625
She's a red-light performer.

1091
00:53:56.659 --> 00:53:58.693
...Under
the leadership there.


1092
00:53:58.728 --> 00:54:00.663
What insight
into Russian actions,


1093
00:54:00.697 --> 00:54:02.232
particularly in
the last couple of weeks,


1094
00:54:02.266 --> 00:54:06.102
does the proximity
of this state give you?


1095
00:54:06.136 --> 00:54:07.836
They're our
next-door neighbors.


1096
00:54:07.870 --> 00:54:11.440
And you can actually see Russia
from land here in Alaska.


1097
00:54:11.474 --> 00:54:13.976
Do you consider
a nuclear Iran...


1098
00:54:14.011 --> 00:54:16.310
- Damn it.
- ...To be an existential threat to Israel?


1099
00:54:16.345 --> 00:54:18.682
And I can see Russia
from my house.


1100
00:54:26.990 --> 00:54:30.793
I believe global
warming is caused by man.


1101
00:54:30.827 --> 00:54:34.231
And I believe it's just
God hugging us closer.


1102
00:54:36.668 --> 00:54:39.669
I don't agree with
the Bush doctrine.


1103
00:54:39.703 --> 00:54:41.671
And I don't
know what that is.


1104
00:54:44.308 --> 00:54:46.175
She initially did
not understand this,


1105
00:54:46.210 --> 00:54:48.545
and I think that, you know, people
can make what they want of it,


1106
00:54:48.578 --> 00:54:51.581
but was I, or anyone, confident that
Sarah Palin now has the wherewithal


1107
00:54:51.615 --> 00:54:53.716
to be president of the United States?
I don't think so.


1108
00:54:53.751 --> 00:54:56.618
A conservative friend called me
up and said "I just can't do it.


1109
00:54:56.653 --> 00:54:59.755
I don't know if I'm voting for
Obama, but I can't have her--


1110
00:54:59.790 --> 00:55:01.757
"she shouldn't be in Washington,
let alone the White House."


1111
00:55:10.402 --> 00:55:12.534
Governor.

1112
00:55:15.272 --> 00:55:16.872
Governor Palin.

1113
00:55:22.946 --> 00:55:25.882
We really should prep for
your Katie Couric interview.


1114
00:55:29.786 --> 00:55:31.254
Fine.

1115
00:55:32.989 --> 00:55:34.757
I wrote a brief synopsis
on the collapse


1116
00:55:34.791 --> 00:55:37.460
of Lehman Brothers
and the financial crisis.


1117
00:55:37.494 --> 00:55:38.961
If you internalize
this document,


1118
00:55:38.996 --> 00:55:42.433
you should be able to field basic
questions about the bail-out.


1119
00:55:53.977 --> 00:55:56.078
Governor...

1120
00:55:56.113 --> 00:55:58.582
The dow just dropped

1121
00:55:58.617 --> 00:56:00.784
Lehman is collapsing.

1122
00:56:00.818 --> 00:56:02.818
The world economy is
on the brink of collapse.


1123
00:56:02.853 --> 00:56:05.856
I am pretty sure the bail-out
is going to come up--


1124
00:56:10.562 --> 00:56:12.895
Okay. Um...

1125
00:56:17.302 --> 00:56:20.137
Why don't we come back to it
after we've warmed up a bit?


1126
00:56:23.908 --> 00:56:25.976
I've put together a list
of the questions...


1127
00:56:26.010 --> 00:56:28.579
That Katie's most likely to ask.

1128
00:56:28.613 --> 00:56:31.382
I used to work with Katie, and I
know she'll ask about abortion.


1129
00:56:31.416 --> 00:56:33.849
Did Steve do the Alaska poll yet?

1130
00:56:33.884 --> 00:56:37.421
- I think it's being done as we speak.
- Bet he didn't even do it.


1131
00:56:42.259 --> 00:56:45.462
Can we try and get through
just a few questions?


1132
00:56:51.468 --> 00:56:54.370
I know you're upset,
Governor.


1133
00:56:54.405 --> 00:56:56.173
So why don't you get
a good night sleep,


1134
00:56:56.207 --> 00:56:58.008
and I will come back
first thing in the morning


1135
00:56:58.042 --> 00:57:00.110
to prep you when
you're feeling better?


1136
00:57:08.553 --> 00:57:11.288
I'm gonna leave this
for you to...


1137
00:57:12.324 --> 00:57:14.758
Look over.

1138
00:57:17.495 --> 00:57:21.164
It's the worst financial crisis
facing the American people


1139
00:57:21.199 --> 00:57:24.101
since the great depression
of the 1920s and '30s.


1140
00:57:24.136 --> 00:57:26.270
The president's massive
financial rescue plan


1141
00:57:26.306 --> 00:57:28.406
under fire from
the left and right.


1142
00:57:28.440 --> 00:57:30.075
Good evening
from the Ford center


1143
00:57:30.108 --> 00:57:32.577
at the university
of Mississippi at Oxford.


1144
00:57:32.611 --> 00:57:34.679
We're here for the first
of three debates


1145
00:57:34.714 --> 00:57:36.179
between Senator
Barack Obama--


1146
00:57:36.214 --> 00:57:38.215
Steve, Steve, let's not
worry about that crap.


1147
00:57:38.249 --> 00:57:39.851
It's all bullshit.

1148
00:57:39.885 --> 00:57:41.518
I'm here at the podium.

1149
00:57:41.553 --> 00:57:44.121
Let's do the fucking debate.

1150
00:57:45.324 --> 00:57:46.991
Hey, John.
Sorry to interrupt.


1151
00:57:47.025 --> 00:57:49.862
I just spoke to our guy
at treasury.


1152
00:57:49.895 --> 00:57:52.763
The bill does not have
enough republican votes.


1153
00:57:52.797 --> 00:57:54.097
God damn it.

1154
00:57:54.131 --> 00:57:56.134
Paulson thinks
the entire world economy


1155
00:57:56.169 --> 00:57:59.071
is on the brink of falling
off the cliff, so...


1156
00:57:59.105 --> 00:58:02.474
We're checkmated.
If the bail-out doesn't pass,


1157
00:58:02.507 --> 00:58:04.675
we're screwed because
Bush, and thus you,


1158
00:58:04.709 --> 00:58:06.377
will be blamed for it.

1159
00:58:06.411 --> 00:58:09.180
- If you pass the bail-out--
- The Republicans will despise me


1160
00:58:09.214 --> 00:58:11.649
- for supporting a bail-out.
- That's it.


1161
00:58:12.919 --> 00:58:14.686
This is it, guys.

1162
00:58:14.720 --> 00:58:17.155
I mean, this is
the whole fucking election.


1163
00:58:17.190 --> 00:58:20.224
Now, we think you should
suspend the campaign,


1164
00:58:20.259 --> 00:58:22.761
postpone the debates,
go to Washington,


1165
00:58:22.795 --> 00:58:26.463
and try to negotiate
a bi-partisan compromise.


1166
00:58:26.498 --> 00:58:29.402
You need to make
a bold move, John.


1167
00:58:31.337 --> 00:58:33.338
This is a big risk.

1168
00:58:33.373 --> 00:58:36.074
I mean,
that's a big gamble.


1169
00:58:37.544 --> 00:58:39.412
We gotta do something.

1170
00:58:39.446 --> 00:58:42.580
I mean nothing can fuck me
more than this.


1171
00:58:42.615 --> 00:58:44.147
Governor, have
you had a chance


1172
00:58:44.181 --> 00:58:47.118
to go over the briefing
materials on the bail-out?


1173
00:58:49.423 --> 00:58:51.256
I really think we need
to try and nail down


1174
00:58:51.290 --> 00:58:53.726
a simple two-sentence response
to the economic crisis.


1175
00:58:53.760 --> 00:58:56.628
- It's gotta be supportive of the concept...
- That's enough powder.


1176
00:58:56.662 --> 00:58:59.464
...Of the bail-out, but also
disappointed that we're at this point,


1177
00:58:59.498 --> 00:59:02.868
making it clear that changes
need to be made to the bill.


1178
00:59:04.337 --> 00:59:05.805
Oh, you need it
a little higher?


1179
00:59:05.839 --> 00:59:08.206
I can do that.
I can do that for you.


1180
00:59:09.609 --> 00:59:11.977
That jacket looks fantastic
on you, by the way.


1181
00:59:12.011 --> 00:59:14.045
It's too open.

1182
00:59:14.079 --> 00:59:16.848
- Don't you think so
- Yeah, it looks wonderful.


1183
00:59:16.882 --> 00:59:18.382
Really great,
really nice.


1184
00:59:18.417 --> 00:59:20.319
It's a great color.

1185
00:59:26.493 --> 00:59:28.927
Do you want me to read
the paper to you?


1186
00:59:33.999 --> 00:59:37.870
"Senator John McCain has requested of
his opponent, Senator Barack Obama,"


1187
00:59:37.904 --> 00:59:40.305
a postponement
of the upcoming debate


1188
00:59:40.340 --> 00:59:42.874
so that both Senators
may return to Capitol Hill


1189
00:59:42.909 --> 00:59:45.710
to address the needs of the
country in this crucial time.


1190
00:59:45.744 --> 00:59:47.613
"Senator Obama has said--"

1191
00:59:53.020 --> 00:59:55.521
I hate this make-up.
I hate it.


1192
00:59:55.555 --> 00:59:57.922
I don't like my hair this way.
I like my hair up.


1193
00:59:57.957 --> 00:59:59.658
Governor,
you look amazing.


1194
00:59:59.693 --> 01:00:03.695
I look fat.
I'm sick of looking fat.


1195
01:00:03.729 --> 01:00:06.899
- You don't look fat--
- Can I get some more tape?


1196
01:00:08.333 --> 01:00:11.104
Yeah.

1197
01:00:11.138 --> 01:00:13.038
I don't know
if we should do Couric.


1198
01:00:13.073 --> 01:00:14.672
She's having
a mini-meltdown.


1199
01:00:14.707 --> 01:00:17.009
Well, we can't have McCain
cancel the debate


1200
01:00:17.044 --> 01:00:19.979
and Palin cancel Katie Couric
in the same week.


1201
01:00:20.013 --> 01:00:21.647
I know,

1202
01:00:21.681 --> 01:00:23.248
but I'm really worried
about her.


1203
01:00:23.282 --> 01:00:25.884
She won't respond
to anything I say.


1204
01:00:25.918 --> 01:00:28.320
Maybe we should bring McCain
in and see what he thinks.


1205
01:00:28.355 --> 01:00:30.022
He doesn't want
to deal with her.


1206
01:00:30.057 --> 01:00:32.792
I haven't even told him
that she doesn't know anything.


1207
01:00:32.826 --> 01:00:35.027
You haven't told him?

1208
01:00:35.062 --> 01:00:37.763
Look, he doesn't
want to know.


1209
01:00:37.798 --> 01:00:39.898
The world economy
is on the brink of collapse.


1210
01:00:39.932 --> 01:00:43.601
Can you just... prep her
in the car ride over?


1211
01:00:43.636 --> 01:00:47.373
Uh, I can try.

1212
01:00:47.406 --> 01:00:51.744
Okay, good.
Try. Thanks.


1213
01:00:51.779 --> 01:00:53.612
Knowing Katie, I'm sure
she's going to ask


1214
01:00:53.647 --> 01:00:55.613
about your stance
on feminism.


1215
01:00:55.648 --> 01:00:57.483
- Did you get the numbers?
- The what?


1216
01:00:57.516 --> 01:01:00.753
My approval rating
in Alaska.


1217
01:01:00.788 --> 01:01:02.822
They're not in yet.

1218
01:01:02.856 --> 01:01:04.490
I am trying to
trust you people,


1219
01:01:04.524 --> 01:01:07.226
but you're making it
really hard for me.


1220
01:01:07.261 --> 01:01:09.595
I'm sorry, Governor.

1221
01:01:09.629 --> 01:01:11.462
I'll call Steve
right away about it.


1222
01:01:11.497 --> 01:01:13.465
Yeah, like that'll
do anything.


1223
01:01:17.070 --> 01:01:19.405
What are you
working on, Governor?


1224
01:01:21.074 --> 01:01:24.311
It's a questionnaire from the
"Mat-Su Valley Frontiersman." in Wasilla.


1225
01:01:24.345 --> 01:01:26.312
You know, an Alaska paper.

1226
01:01:26.346 --> 01:01:27.813
Don't you think
we should prepare


1227
01:01:27.847 --> 01:01:30.081
for your national
Couric interview first?


1228
01:01:30.116 --> 01:01:33.351
No, Nicolle, I don't.
This is my priority.


1229
01:01:33.385 --> 01:01:38.825
I am not going to ignore
the people of Alaska any more.


1230
01:01:48.336 --> 01:01:51.739
You've cited Alaska's
proximity to Russia


1231
01:01:51.772 --> 01:01:54.040
as part of your foreign
policy experience.


1232
01:01:54.075 --> 01:01:55.308
What did you mean by that?

1233
01:01:55.344 --> 01:01:59.112
That Alaska has a very
narrow maritime border


1234
01:01:59.147 --> 01:02:02.781
between a foreign country,
Russia, and on our other side,


1235
01:02:02.816 --> 01:02:06.952
the land boundary
that we have with Canada.


1236
01:02:06.986 --> 01:02:09.556
It's funny that
a comment like that


1237
01:02:09.591 --> 01:02:14.194
was kind of made to--

1238
01:02:14.229 --> 01:02:15.695
I don't know.
You know, reporters.


1239
01:02:15.729 --> 01:02:17.429
- Mocked?
- Yeah, mocked.


1240
01:02:17.464 --> 01:02:18.865
I guess that's
the word, yeah.


1241
01:02:18.899 --> 01:02:21.468
Well, explain to me
why that enhances


1242
01:02:21.502 --> 01:02:23.470
your foreign policy
credentials.


1243
01:02:23.504 --> 01:02:27.341
Well, it certainly
does because our--


1244
01:02:27.376 --> 01:02:29.877
our next-door neighbors
are foreign countries.


1245
01:02:29.911 --> 01:02:33.913
They're in the state
that I am the executive of.


1246
01:02:33.947 --> 01:02:36.616
Have you ever been involved
with any negotiations,


1247
01:02:36.650 --> 01:02:38.551
for example,
with the Russians?


1248
01:02:38.586 --> 01:02:40.552
We have trade missions
back and forth.


1249
01:02:40.588 --> 01:02:42.256
We do.
It's very important


1250
01:02:42.290 --> 01:02:45.659
when you consider even national
security issues with Russia,


1251
01:02:45.694 --> 01:02:49.161
as Putin rears his head
and comes into the airspace


1252
01:02:49.196 --> 01:02:51.330
of the United States
of America,


1253
01:02:51.365 --> 01:02:53.166
where do they go?

1254
01:02:53.200 --> 01:02:56.168
It's Alaska. It's just
right over the border.


1255
01:02:56.203 --> 01:02:58.572
And when it comes to
establishing your world-view,


1256
01:02:58.608 --> 01:03:02.242
I was curious-- what
newspapers and magazines


1257
01:03:02.277 --> 01:03:06.513
did you regularly read before
you were tapped for this


1258
01:03:06.547 --> 01:03:08.314
to stay informed
and to understand--


1259
01:03:08.348 --> 01:03:11.418
I've read most of them,
again with a great appreciation


1260
01:03:11.452 --> 01:03:13.586
for the press,
for the media.


1261
01:03:13.621 --> 01:03:16.089
What ones specifically?
I'm curious.


1262
01:03:16.124 --> 01:03:17.758
Name one fucking paper.

1263
01:03:17.793 --> 01:03:19.627
All of 'Em.
Any of 'Em


1264
01:03:19.661 --> 01:03:22.829
that have been in front of me
over all these years.


1265
01:03:22.863 --> 01:03:25.799
Oh, my God.
What have we done?


1266
01:03:25.834 --> 01:03:28.502
If John McCain wins,
this woman will be


1267
01:03:28.536 --> 01:03:31.203
one 72-year-old's
heartbeat away


1268
01:03:31.238 --> 01:03:33.942
from being the president
of the United States.


1269
01:03:33.975 --> 01:03:36.477
And if that doesn't scare
the hell out of you, it should.


1270
01:03:36.510 --> 01:03:38.611
In fairness,
probably most people


1271
01:03:38.646 --> 01:03:41.247
can't name
a supreme court case.


1272
01:03:41.281 --> 01:03:43.783
But most people
are not campaigning


1273
01:03:43.818 --> 01:03:45.418
- to be vice president.
- Right, right.


1274
01:03:45.453 --> 01:03:48.189
It's not that she doesn't
know the right answer.


1275
01:03:48.223 --> 01:03:51.325
It's that she clearly does not
understand the question.


1276
01:03:51.359 --> 01:03:54.895
This is way beyond
anything we have ever seen


1277
01:03:54.930 --> 01:03:56.696
from a national candidate.

1278
01:04:01.401 --> 01:04:02.770
Why'd you make me
do Katie Couric?


1279
01:04:02.804 --> 01:04:05.874
Did you see the coverage?
Did you?


1280
01:04:05.908 --> 01:04:08.008
Are you there?
Are you listening to me?


1281
01:04:08.042 --> 01:04:10.143
Yes, Governor.
I'm here.


1282
01:04:10.177 --> 01:04:11.645
Katie was a logical choice.

1283
01:04:11.680 --> 01:04:13.681
She's been very fair to us
this entire campaign.


1284
01:04:13.715 --> 01:04:15.048
You call that interview fair?

1285
01:04:15.083 --> 01:04:16.717
Yes, Governor, I do.

1286
01:04:16.751 --> 01:04:19.687
I certainly don't.
She was out to get me from the get-go.


1287
01:04:19.721 --> 01:04:21.087
No, she wasn't.

1288
01:04:21.121 --> 01:04:22.591
The interview sucked
because you didn't try.


1289
01:04:22.625 --> 01:04:24.424
What do you mean,
I didn't try?


1290
01:04:24.458 --> 01:04:25.826
You didn't fight back
like you did


1291
01:04:25.861 --> 01:04:26.961
in the Charlie Gibson interview.

1292
01:04:26.994 --> 01:04:28.195
When you didn't
know the answers,


1293
01:04:28.229 --> 01:04:29.929
you clawed your way back
and it went fine.


1294
01:04:29.965 --> 01:04:31.665
You just gave up.

1295
01:04:31.700 --> 01:04:33.534
Nicolle, it wasn't my fault.

1296
01:04:33.568 --> 01:04:35.469
I wasn't properly prepped.

1297
01:04:35.504 --> 01:04:38.539
You weren't properly prepped
because you wouldn't listen to us.


1298
01:04:38.573 --> 01:04:40.674
You never listen
to your advisors.


1299
01:04:40.709 --> 01:04:42.676
Because you're
overwhelming me


1300
01:04:42.711 --> 01:04:44.645
with too much information.

1301
01:04:44.679 --> 01:04:46.647
I don't want to do
these interviews.


1302
01:04:46.681 --> 01:04:48.817
I want to do
what I want to do.


1303
01:04:48.851 --> 01:04:52.119
We're just trying to help you
get through this, Governor.


1304
01:04:52.153 --> 01:04:54.021
All we want is
for you to succeed.


1305
01:04:54.055 --> 01:04:56.023
Yeah, well,
you're not helping.


1306
01:04:56.057 --> 01:04:57.925
You're just screwing me up.

1307
01:04:57.959 --> 01:05:01.094
You're telling me what to say,
what to wear, how to talk.


1308
01:05:01.129 --> 01:05:03.163
I am not your puppet!

1309
01:05:03.197 --> 01:05:04.698
Now I understand
what Hillary meant


1310
01:05:04.734 --> 01:05:06.400
when she said she had
to find her own voice.


1311
01:05:06.435 --> 01:05:10.137
Yeah, 'cause you're
just like Hillary.


1312
01:05:12.674 --> 01:05:14.542
You have ruined me.

1313
01:05:14.576 --> 01:05:16.844
You have ruined
my reputation.


1314
01:05:16.878 --> 01:05:20.113
I am ruined in Alaska!

1315
01:05:29.791 --> 01:05:32.225
This is Steve Schmidt.
Leave a message.


1316
01:05:32.260 --> 01:05:34.162
Steve, it's Nicolle.

1317
01:05:34.196 --> 01:05:36.598
I will gladly resign if you
want to blame me for Couric.


1318
01:05:36.632 --> 01:05:39.634
But if you want me to stay, then
I'm back on McCain's bus tomorrow


1319
01:05:39.669 --> 01:05:42.302
as I never want to deal
with that woman ever again.


1320
01:05:43.805 --> 01:05:46.775
What lessons have
you learned from Iraq


1321
01:05:46.809 --> 01:05:50.778
and how specifically would
you spread democracy abroad?


1322
01:05:50.812 --> 01:05:53.782
Specifically, we would make
every effort possible


1323
01:05:53.816 --> 01:05:56.517
to spread democracy abroad
to those who want it.


1324
01:05:59.587 --> 01:06:03.458
Yes, but specifically,
what would you do?


1325
01:06:03.492 --> 01:06:05.459
We're gonna promote freedom,

1326
01:06:05.493 --> 01:06:08.229
Usher in Democratic
values and ideals,


1327
01:06:08.263 --> 01:06:11.066
and fight terror-loving
terrorists.


1328
01:06:13.769 --> 01:06:16.904
But again, and not
to belabor the point,


1329
01:06:16.938 --> 01:06:18.905
one specific thing.

1330
01:06:27.650 --> 01:06:30.151
Katie, I'd like to use
one of my lifelines.


1331
01:06:37.994 --> 01:06:41.395
- I'm sorry?
- I want to phone a friend.


1332
01:06:43.532 --> 01:06:45.500
..Friday's debate
should proceed.


1333
01:06:45.534 --> 01:06:47.602
We've been working
around the clock


1334
01:06:47.636 --> 01:06:50.437
...and presidents are going
to have to deal with


1335
01:06:50.471 --> 01:06:52.473
more than one thing
at a time.


1336
01:06:52.508 --> 01:06:54.543
A new CNN/Time
opinion research poll


1337
01:06:54.577 --> 01:06:58.113
- show Obama surging in key battleground states...
- Son of a bitch.


1338
01:06:58.147 --> 01:07:00.314
...Like Pennsylvania where he
is now up by nine points.


1339
01:07:00.349 --> 01:07:02.751
Governor, I just
want you to know


1340
01:07:02.785 --> 01:07:04.918
I got your Alaskan
poll numbers in,


1341
01:07:04.953 --> 01:07:06.954
and you'll be
pleased to know


1342
01:07:06.988 --> 01:07:10.224
- that you're in the low 70s.
- Fine.


1343
01:07:18.367 --> 01:07:21.168
- Why are they fucking me like this?
- Who?


1344
01:07:21.202 --> 01:07:24.472
The press!
They used to love me.


1345
01:07:24.505 --> 01:07:28.043
Now all they want to do
in life is fuck me over.


1346
01:07:28.078 --> 01:07:30.444
I can't believe
Katie did that to me.


1347
01:07:30.479 --> 01:07:33.115
And did you hear what Olbermann
said about me last night?


1348
01:07:33.150 --> 01:07:36.817
Sir, you've got to stop
watching Keith Olbermann,


1349
01:07:36.851 --> 01:07:40.221
or FOX, for that matter.
It's all just bullshit.


1350
01:07:42.158 --> 01:07:44.726
Now, sir,
you should have a beer


1351
01:07:44.760 --> 01:07:46.696
and watch ESPN, okay?

1352
01:07:46.730 --> 01:07:48.197
And while
you're watching it,


1353
01:07:48.231 --> 01:07:50.566
think about what
the people who watch ESPN


1354
01:07:50.599 --> 01:07:52.567
really need in their lives
right now.


1355
01:07:52.601 --> 01:07:54.268
I thought Katie liked me.

1356
01:07:54.303 --> 01:07:57.538
She does.
And the questions were fair.


1357
01:07:57.573 --> 01:08:01.410
It was Governor Palin
who gave a terrible interview.


1358
01:08:01.444 --> 01:08:03.112
That poor girl.

1359
01:08:04.414 --> 01:08:06.515
She wasn't ready for this.

1360
01:08:06.549 --> 01:08:09.784
Yeah, I'm afraid
you're right, sir.


1361
01:08:09.819 --> 01:08:14.288
And YouTube is making it
exponentially worse.


1362
01:08:14.323 --> 01:08:16.691
People are watching
Katie Couric and Tina Fey


1363
01:08:16.726 --> 01:08:18.194
over and over again.

1364
01:08:18.228 --> 01:08:20.830
It's playing like
an infinite loop on the web.


1365
01:08:20.865 --> 01:08:24.398
No presidential campaign has ever
had to deal with this before.


1366
01:08:24.433 --> 01:08:28.437
But she's gonna do a good job
in the debate, right?


1367
01:08:28.470 --> 01:08:31.106
Yes, sir.
She'll be great.


1368
01:08:31.140 --> 01:08:33.774
'Cause if it goes like Couric,
I don't think we can recover.


1369
01:08:33.808 --> 01:08:37.247
I agree, and I promise
she'll be great.


1370
01:08:37.280 --> 01:08:39.180
I hope you're right.

1371
01:08:40.816 --> 01:08:43.385
I hope you're right, Steve.

1372
01:08:43.419 --> 01:08:45.520
It's gonna be fine.

1373
01:08:54.330 --> 01:08:57.867
Okay, this one came up
in the '96 debate.


1374
01:08:57.900 --> 01:08:59.668
Is there a magic bullet

1375
01:08:59.702 --> 01:09:01.836
to solve the problem
of public education?


1376
01:09:01.871 --> 01:09:04.907
If not, what is
the best solution?


1377
01:09:08.279 --> 01:09:10.679
Uh, Governor?

1378
01:09:17.353 --> 01:09:20.090
Governor, would you like
something to eat?


1379
01:09:22.625 --> 01:09:26.663
Yeah, I think you should
eat something, Governor.


1380
01:09:26.697 --> 01:09:28.431
How about
a diet Dr. pepper?


1381
01:09:28.465 --> 01:09:30.267
Would you like--
could you?


1382
01:09:33.303 --> 01:09:35.437
Governor?

1383
01:09:37.107 --> 01:09:40.441
I miss my baby.
I miss sleeping with my baby.


1384
01:09:42.478 --> 01:09:45.282
She constantly slips
into these catatonic stupors.


1385
01:09:45.316 --> 01:09:47.217
And then when we do
finally get her to work,


1386
01:09:47.251 --> 01:09:49.052
she writes all the
information down on notecards,


1387
01:09:49.086 --> 01:09:51.087
but she can't
remember any of it.


1388
01:09:52.456 --> 01:09:54.656
Steve, did you do an
approval poll in Alaska?


1389
01:09:54.690 --> 01:09:57.026
- She keeps bringing it up.
- What the fuck?


1390
01:09:57.060 --> 01:09:59.495
I did that stupid fucking
poll a week ago.


1391
01:09:59.530 --> 01:10:01.231
I told her
she's in the 70s.


1392
01:10:01.265 --> 01:10:02.732
Yeah, well, I don't think
she believes you.


1393
01:10:02.766 --> 01:10:04.334
She says you made
those numbers up.


1394
01:10:04.367 --> 01:10:06.136
Okay.

1395
01:10:06.170 --> 01:10:09.672
- She is becoming completely irrational.
- Becoming?


1396
01:10:12.175 --> 01:10:13.775
I don't even like
to say this,


1397
01:10:13.810 --> 01:10:15.478
but has it occurred
to you guys


1398
01:10:15.512 --> 01:10:17.447
that she might be
mentally unstable?


1399
01:10:20.885 --> 01:10:24.121
Mark, look, the debate
is in five days.


1400
01:10:24.155 --> 01:10:26.088
What do you think?

1401
01:10:27.590 --> 01:10:31.995
I think this debate will
be a debacle of historic


1402
01:10:32.030 --> 01:10:34.664
and epic proportions.

1403
01:10:37.335 --> 01:10:39.736
Well, that's encouraging.

1404
01:10:55.988 --> 01:10:58.254
What would you say
best qualifies you


1405
01:10:58.288 --> 01:11:00.756
to be John McCain's
running mate?


1406
01:11:02.393 --> 01:11:06.329
John McCain has that streak
of independence in him


1407
01:11:06.364 --> 01:11:10.133
that I think is very, very
important in our leadership today.


1408
01:11:10.168 --> 01:11:12.036
I have that
within me also.


1409
01:11:12.070 --> 01:11:14.303
And that's why
John McCain tapped me,


1410
01:11:14.337 --> 01:11:16.305
to be a team of mavericks,

1411
01:11:16.339 --> 01:11:19.509
of independence
as a team member


1412
01:11:19.543 --> 01:11:22.380
on this, um--
in this new team.


1413
01:11:22.414 --> 01:11:24.814
Um, I'm gonna do
that one over again.


1414
01:11:24.849 --> 01:11:26.317
- Yeah, sure.
- John--


1415
01:11:26.351 --> 01:11:29.086
Governor,
important to remember


1416
01:11:29.121 --> 01:11:32.055
that you don't need
to say anything specific.


1417
01:11:32.089 --> 01:11:34.823
Okay? If you don't know
the answer to the question,


1418
01:11:34.857 --> 01:11:37.827
just bring it back to the general
theme of reforming America


1419
01:11:37.861 --> 01:11:40.696
or pivot to one of your
stronger suits, like energy.


1420
01:11:40.731 --> 01:11:43.666
Yeah, 'cause that's where
I'm most comfortable.


1421
01:11:43.701 --> 01:11:45.803
That's pretty clear.

1422
01:11:45.837 --> 01:11:47.603
Let's try
another question.


1423
01:11:47.638 --> 01:11:49.139
Global warming--

1424
01:11:49.173 --> 01:11:50.806
Governor Palin,
do you believe


1425
01:11:50.841 --> 01:11:53.043
that global warming
is man-made?


1426
01:11:56.014 --> 01:11:57.714
Um... ahem.

1427
01:11:57.749 --> 01:12:00.217
I think all this talk
and gibber-gabber


1428
01:12:00.252 --> 01:12:03.719
about where global warming
comes from defeats--


1429
01:12:03.754 --> 01:12:06.722
defeats, you know, the point
that it's getting hotter


1430
01:12:06.758 --> 01:12:10.928
and that we all need to be
very concerned about heat.


1431
01:12:10.963 --> 01:12:13.164
And, um...

1432
01:12:13.198 --> 01:12:14.665
That, um...

1433
01:12:14.700 --> 01:12:16.835
I-
- I--

1434
01:12:16.868 --> 01:12:18.301
forgot it and
it's not in this--


1435
01:12:18.336 --> 01:12:21.637
Mark, all the cards are
supposed to be in this pile.


1436
01:12:21.672 --> 01:12:23.473
- Okay.
- It's not in this pile.


1437
01:12:23.508 --> 01:12:26.142
I think we need
to take a break.


1438
01:12:26.177 --> 01:12:28.244
Can you all leave us
alone for a minute?


1439
01:12:39.958 --> 01:12:41.858
The debate
is in four days,


1440
01:12:41.892 --> 01:12:44.361
and this isn't working,
Governor.


1441
01:12:44.395 --> 01:12:46.464
I know.

1442
01:12:50.135 --> 01:12:54.271
I think you should get off
this no-carb diet immediately.


1443
01:12:55.374 --> 01:12:57.708
This goofy diet
is bad for you,


1444
01:12:57.742 --> 01:12:59.810
and I'm alarmed
by your weight loss.


1445
01:13:01.613 --> 01:13:05.518
Governor, the Katie Couric
interview didn't go well.


1446
01:13:05.552 --> 01:13:09.420
And it wasn't
Nicolle Wallace's fault.


1447
01:13:09.453 --> 01:13:11.221
It wasn't
Katie Couric's fault.


1448
01:13:11.255 --> 01:13:13.391
It wasn't the liberal
media's fault.


1449
01:13:13.425 --> 01:13:16.728
It was your fault,
because you didn't prepare.


1450
01:13:16.762 --> 01:13:18.963
And there can never
be another instance


1451
01:13:18.998 --> 01:13:22.401
of something not going well
because you didn't prepare.


1452
01:13:33.612 --> 01:13:36.014
Hey.

1453
01:13:36.048 --> 01:13:38.017
Hey, hey, hey.

1454
01:13:38.051 --> 01:13:39.617
Look, you had
a bad interview.


1455
01:13:39.652 --> 01:13:43.054
It's okay, it happens.

1456
01:13:43.088 --> 01:13:48.059
You know what Ronald Reagan
said caused pollution?


1457
01:13:49.327 --> 01:13:51.162
Trees.

1458
01:13:55.901 --> 01:13:58.703
- Reagan said that?
- He did.


1459
01:13:58.737 --> 01:14:01.173
He said trees
cause pollution.


1460
01:14:01.206 --> 01:14:04.475
And he not only
won the election,


1461
01:14:04.510 --> 01:14:07.545
he went on to be
a great president.


1462
01:14:10.649 --> 01:14:15.454
I just-- I don't want
to let John down.


1463
01:14:25.131 --> 01:14:26.731
Stevie boy.

1464
01:14:26.765 --> 01:14:29.234
We have a problem, sir.

1465
01:14:30.335 --> 01:14:32.536
What-- what's going on?

1466
01:14:32.571 --> 01:14:34.773
It's Palin.

1467
01:14:34.808 --> 01:14:38.743
She could be on the verge of a
complete nervous breakdown.


1468
01:14:40.614 --> 01:14:43.916
I don't know what to do.

1469
01:14:43.950 --> 01:14:47.551
We threw her into the deep end
without a life preserver.


1470
01:14:47.586 --> 01:14:49.253
Yeah, and we're drowning
with her, sir.


1471
01:14:51.724 --> 01:14:53.524
We need to get her back
with her family.


1472
01:14:53.559 --> 01:14:56.695
She needs to be
surrounded by--


1473
01:14:56.729 --> 01:14:59.396
by people who love her.

1474
01:15:00.531 --> 01:15:03.435
Hey, let's get 'Em
all out to Sedona,


1475
01:15:03.468 --> 01:15:05.370
out in the open air.

1476
01:15:05.404 --> 01:15:07.172
My neighbor's a doctor,

1477
01:15:07.206 --> 01:15:10.608
and Cindy can invite him over
for a barbeque or something,


1478
01:15:10.643 --> 01:15:12.343
and he can observe her

1479
01:15:12.377 --> 01:15:14.646
and see if it's truly serious.

1480
01:15:14.680 --> 01:15:16.413
But let's just
get 'Em to Sedona.


1481
01:15:16.448 --> 01:15:18.817
It'll do wonders for her,
I know it.


1482
01:15:18.852 --> 01:15:20.718
Yes, sir.
Absolutely.

Oh, hey!

1490
01:15:58.624 --> 01:16:00.859
I missed you guys so much.

1491
01:16:00.894 --> 01:16:03.996
- Hi! Mommy, mommy!
- Oh, my goodness!


1492
01:16:05.764 --> 01:16:07.165
Got someone
who wants to say hi.


1493
01:16:07.199 --> 01:16:09.301
Hi!

1494
01:16:12.471 --> 01:16:14.773
- What's up, doc?
- Hey, how you doing?


1495
01:16:14.808 --> 01:16:18.376
That depends.
How's she look?


1496
01:16:18.411 --> 01:16:20.746
For a woman who's
just had a baby,


1497
01:16:20.780 --> 01:16:23.881
has a pregnant teen daughter
and a son in Iraq,


1498
01:16:23.916 --> 01:16:26.752
I'd say not half bad.

1499
01:16:27.888 --> 01:16:30.757
You, however,
look like shit.


1500
01:16:33.393 --> 01:16:35.327
They keep piling
all this stuff on me,


1501
01:16:35.362 --> 01:16:37.362
and I just can't
remember everything.


1502
01:16:37.396 --> 01:16:40.199
- Are you getting some of it?
- Yeah.


1503
01:16:40.233 --> 01:16:42.068
Some, but I have to talk

1504
01:16:42.103 --> 01:16:45.271
for like 90 minutes up there.

1505
01:16:45.305 --> 01:16:47.641
Do you remember
when you debated Halcro?


1506
01:16:48.610 --> 01:16:50.510
He had no notes,
no papers,


1507
01:16:50.545 --> 01:16:54.012
and he could spout off
all these facts and figures?


1508
01:16:54.047 --> 01:16:56.482
You were so intimidated...

1509
01:16:57.618 --> 01:16:59.184
Until you looked out
at the audience.


1510
01:16:59.219 --> 01:17:00.919
What'd you realize?

1511
01:17:00.955 --> 01:17:03.422
That none of what
he said mattered,


1512
01:17:03.458 --> 01:17:05.692
because no one knew
what he was talking about.


1513
01:17:05.727 --> 01:17:08.994
It's the same thing here, baby.
It's just more people.


1514
01:17:10.063 --> 01:17:11.497
You're getting
yourself in trouble,


1515
01:17:11.531 --> 01:17:12.998
because they're
trying to turn you


1516
01:17:13.031 --> 01:17:15.101
into something
that you're not.


1517
01:17:15.135 --> 01:17:17.771
You gotta do what you do.

1518
01:17:17.805 --> 01:17:20.940
Just talk to people
the way you talk to them.


1519
01:17:20.975 --> 01:17:23.209
And they'll love you.

1520
01:17:24.511 --> 01:17:26.345
They always have.

1521
01:17:26.380 --> 01:17:29.582
I love you, first dude.

1522
01:17:29.616 --> 01:17:31.717
I love you, too...

1523
01:17:33.087 --> 01:17:34.988
Mrs. vice president.

1524
01:17:37.425 --> 01:17:39.159
Mm-hmm.

1525
01:18:08.356 --> 01:18:09.791
Steve, what's up?

1526
01:18:09.824 --> 01:18:12.592
How many questions does Sarah Palin
have to answer in the debate?


1527
01:18:12.627 --> 01:18:15.695
22 to 25.

1528
01:18:15.729 --> 01:18:17.731
And how long
is each answer?


1529
01:18:17.765 --> 01:18:19.598
Two minutes with pivots.

1530
01:18:19.633 --> 01:18:21.401
So if all we have to do

1531
01:18:21.436 --> 01:18:24.204
is get the best actress
in American politics


1532
01:18:24.238 --> 01:18:27.441
to memorize 45 minutes'
worth of answers,


1533
01:18:27.474 --> 01:18:29.642
then why did
we waste five days


1534
01:18:29.676 --> 01:18:33.547
trying to get her to understand
what any of this shit means?


1535
01:18:36.616 --> 01:18:38.718
Governor, I didn't know
you were going for a jog.


1536
01:18:38.752 --> 01:18:41.755
- I have a different strategy.
- I need to clear my head for a bit.


1537
01:18:41.788 --> 01:18:43.858
Well, we really
need to prepare--


1538
01:18:43.891 --> 01:18:45.960
I really need
to go running, Steve,


1539
01:18:45.993 --> 01:18:47.760
'cause it's gonna
make me feel better.


1540
01:18:47.795 --> 01:18:49.230
Can you understand that?

1541
01:18:49.264 --> 01:18:51.297
Of course, Governor.

1542
01:19:05.080 --> 01:19:08.313
I think we need to get rid
of these notecards.


1543
01:19:08.349 --> 01:19:11.784
- They're not helping.
- Okay.


1544
01:19:11.818 --> 01:19:13.854
I hate those
flippin' cards anyway.


1545
01:19:13.889 --> 01:19:17.124
Now, what we
need you to do


1546
01:19:17.158 --> 01:19:21.161
is to memorize 25 answers
and four attack lines.


1547
01:19:21.196 --> 01:19:24.230
Do you think
you can do that?


1548
01:19:24.265 --> 01:19:25.865
Yeah, I can do that.

1549
01:19:27.868 --> 01:19:30.104
And you're gonna be great.

1550
01:19:48.356 --> 01:19:51.927
And we are to be that
shining city on a hill,


1551
01:19:51.961 --> 01:19:55.061
as president Reagan
so beautifully said,


1552
01:19:55.095 --> 01:19:57.596
and that we are
a beacon of hope


1553
01:19:57.631 --> 01:20:00.533
and that we are
unapologetic here.


1554
01:20:00.567 --> 01:20:01.969
Governor Palin,

1555
01:20:02.003 --> 01:20:05.807
nuclear Iran is one
of our gravest threats.


1556
01:20:05.841 --> 01:20:09.110
What would a McCain
administration do to stop it?


1557
01:20:09.145 --> 01:20:11.745
On the subject
of "nucular" Iran,


1558
01:20:11.779 --> 01:20:14.281
Senator O'Biden and I
are most likely in agreement.


1559
01:20:14.316 --> 01:20:16.449
They cannot be allowed

1560
01:20:16.483 --> 01:20:20.188
to acquire "nucular"
weapons, period.


1561
01:20:20.221 --> 01:20:22.456
Israel is in jeopady, of course,

1562
01:20:22.490 --> 01:20:24.158
when dealing
with Ahmadinejad


1563
01:20:24.193 --> 01:20:26.793
as a leader of Iran.

1564
01:20:26.828 --> 01:20:29.495
It was Ronald Reagan
who said that freedom


1565
01:20:29.529 --> 01:20:32.732
is always just one generation
away from extinction.


1566
01:20:32.767 --> 01:20:35.970
We don't pass it to our
children in the bloodstream,


1567
01:20:36.004 --> 01:20:38.974
we have to fight for it
and protect it,


1568
01:20:39.008 --> 01:20:40.441
and then hand it to them

1569
01:20:40.475 --> 01:20:42.876
so that they
shall do the same.


1570
01:20:42.910 --> 01:20:44.711
We will fight for it.

1571
01:20:44.745 --> 01:20:47.314
And there is only
one man in this race


1572
01:20:47.349 --> 01:20:51.085
who has really ever
fought for you,


1573
01:20:51.119 --> 01:20:53.220
and that's Senator
John McCain.


1574
01:20:53.254 --> 01:20:55.555
Yeah!

1575
01:20:55.590 --> 01:20:57.058
Yeah, she's back!

1576
01:20:57.093 --> 01:21:00.794
Sarah Palin is back,
ladies and gentlemen.


1577
01:21:00.828 --> 01:21:02.329
Whoo!

1578
01:21:02.364 --> 01:21:04.431
- Great job, Governor.
- It was pretty good, huh?


1579
01:21:04.466 --> 01:21:05.932
Pretty good?
It was amazing.


1580
01:21:05.967 --> 01:21:08.335
There's just one slight
adjustment I want to give you.


1581
01:21:08.370 --> 01:21:10.472
You need to call him
Senator Biden,


1582
01:21:10.506 --> 01:21:13.441
- not Senator O'Biden.
- That's what I called him, Senator O'Biden.


1583
01:21:13.476 --> 01:21:15.109
- You just said it again.
- Said what?


1584
01:21:15.143 --> 01:21:17.544
- O'Biden.
- Right. Senator Biden.


1585
01:21:17.578 --> 01:21:20.414
- That's it.
- Oh. Biden.


1586
01:21:20.448 --> 01:21:23.650
- No, no, there's no "o."
- No, I meant "oh," as in "oh, I get it,"


1587
01:21:23.685 --> 01:21:25.285
not "o" as in o'Biden.

1588
01:21:25.320 --> 01:21:27.055
Oh.

1589
01:21:27.089 --> 01:21:29.624
Okay, well,
let's practice it.


1590
01:21:29.658 --> 01:21:32.626
Governor, do you agree
with Senator Biden's


1591
01:21:32.660 --> 01:21:34.162
position on the bail-out?

1592
01:21:34.196 --> 01:21:36.030
- Senator o'Biden--
- Biden!


1593
01:21:36.064 --> 01:21:37.532
Doggone it!

1594
01:21:51.246 --> 01:21:53.713
- This is Sarah.
-  Hey, mom.


1595
01:21:53.748 --> 01:21:55.782
Hey, honey.
How are ya?


1596
01:21:55.816 --> 01:21:57.218
I'm good. I'm--

1597
01:21:57.253 --> 01:21:59.653
- I'm good, mom.
- Where are you?


1598
01:21:59.687 --> 01:22:02.023
Um, I'm not really
allowed to say.


1599
01:22:02.057 --> 01:22:04.124
Okay, sweetie,
but you're safe?


1600
01:22:04.159 --> 01:22:06.293
Yeah, no,
i'm fine, I'm fine.


1601
01:22:06.327 --> 01:22:08.095
I just wanted to wish you
a good debate.


1602
01:22:08.130 --> 01:22:10.265
Thank you.

1603
01:22:10.299 --> 01:22:13.334
- Did you study?
- I did.


1604
01:22:13.369 --> 01:22:15.002
A lot.

1605
01:22:15.037 --> 01:22:17.004
I'll be praying for you.

1606
01:22:17.039 --> 01:22:18.439
Please, I'll need it.

1607
01:22:18.473 --> 01:22:20.475
Come on, mom,
you're gonna do great.


1608
01:22:22.010 --> 01:22:23.445
I love you.

1609
01:22:23.478 --> 01:22:25.713
I love you so much, Track.

1610
01:22:25.747 --> 01:22:29.517
- Fall in!
- I gotta go, mom.


1611
01:22:29.552 --> 01:22:31.686
No, no, no. Just--
just another minute.


1612
01:22:31.720 --> 01:22:33.288
No, I'm really sorry,
but I really gotta go.


1613
01:22:33.322 --> 01:22:35.022
You're gonna do
great tonight, okay?


1614
01:22:35.057 --> 01:22:37.824
Thank you, thank you, but,
sweetie-- sweetie, you be safe.


1615
01:22:37.859 --> 01:22:40.695
I will.

1616
01:22:40.728 --> 01:22:42.564
Bye.

1617
01:22:49.305 --> 01:22:50.938
You okay?

1618
01:22:52.507 --> 01:22:54.609
My son is safe.

1619
01:22:56.079 --> 01:22:57.846
My son is safe.

1620
01:23:09.125 --> 01:23:11.326
Well, what we are
going to see


1621
01:23:11.360 --> 01:23:13.962
is probably
the most anticipated


1622
01:23:13.997 --> 01:23:15.731
vice presidential debate

1623
01:23:15.765 --> 01:23:18.466
that I have covered ever.

1624
01:23:18.501 --> 01:23:20.869
A lot, a lot of pressure
on Sarah Palin.


1625
01:23:20.903 --> 01:23:22.837
As for Joe Biden,
it's sort of a,


1626
01:23:22.871 --> 01:23:25.173
first of all,
do-no-harm night for him.


1627
01:23:25.207 --> 01:23:28.543
No one has questioned
that he is qualified


1628
01:23:28.578 --> 01:23:29.978
to be vice president.

1629
01:23:30.013 --> 01:23:31.580
He needs to--
both of them,


1630
01:23:31.615 --> 01:23:33.548
need to talk about the top
of their tickets.


1631
01:23:33.582 --> 01:23:36.484
After all,
this isn't a race to be Vice President


1632
01:23:36.519 --> 01:23:39.219
so much as it is
to be number two


1633
01:23:39.254 --> 01:23:41.222
to the top people
on the ticket.


1634
01:23:41.257 --> 01:23:43.959
On the Joe Biden side,
you will see


1635
01:23:43.993 --> 01:23:46.995
an effort to say,
"look, Sarah Palin..."


1636
01:23:47.031 --> 01:23:49.966
Hurry.

1637
01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:51.833
Pray with me.

1638
01:23:51.868 --> 01:23:53.669
What should we pray for?

1639
01:23:53.703 --> 01:23:56.304
Just pray that
we win the debate.


1640
01:23:56.338 --> 01:23:59.007
Mom, that would be cheating.

1641
01:24:03.746 --> 01:24:05.814
Okay.

1642
01:24:10.920 --> 01:24:12.519
We want to welcome
our viewers


1643
01:24:12.554 --> 01:24:14.155
in the United States
and around the world.


1644
01:24:14.189 --> 01:24:17.559
I'm Wolf Blitzer,
together with the best...


1645
01:24:17.594 --> 01:24:20.963
We've been waiting for this
night for a long time...


1646
01:24:24.266 --> 01:24:27.634
I did this same walk for
Geraldine Ferraro in 1984.


1647
01:24:27.670 --> 01:24:29.137
Holy jeez, that's cool.

1648
01:24:29.172 --> 01:24:30.772
This is your toe mark.

1649
01:24:30.807 --> 01:24:32.508
Okay.

1650
01:24:33.844 --> 01:24:35.311
30 seconds.

1651
01:24:35.345 --> 01:24:37.747
Two, pull back wide
on her entrance, please.


1652
01:24:37.781 --> 01:24:41.117
Ready, two.
And take two.


1653
01:24:43.720 --> 01:24:45.954
Good evening from
Washington university


1654
01:24:45.988 --> 01:24:47.488
in St. Louis, Missouri.

1655
01:24:47.523 --> 01:24:49.291
I'm Gwen Ifill
of the "news hour"


1656
01:24:49.326 --> 01:24:51.594
and "Washington week"
on PBS.


1657
01:24:51.628 --> 01:24:54.563
Welcome to the first
and the only 2008


1658
01:24:54.598 --> 01:24:56.032
vice presidential debate

1659
01:24:56.066 --> 01:24:57.700
between the republican
nominee,


1660
01:24:57.735 --> 01:24:59.901
Governor Sarah Palin
of Alaska,


1661
01:24:59.937 --> 01:25:03.171
and the Democratic nominee,
Joe Biden of Delaware.


1662
01:25:03.206 --> 01:25:06.342
Tonight's discussion will cover
a wide range of topics,


1663
01:25:06.376 --> 01:25:09.812
including domestic
and foreign policy matters.


1664
01:25:09.847 --> 01:25:11.748
Each candidate
will have 90 seconds


1665
01:25:11.782 --> 01:25:14.184
to respond
to a direct question


1666
01:25:14.219 --> 01:25:15.885
and then an additional
two minutes


1667
01:25:15.919 --> 01:25:17.719
for rebuttal
and follow-up.


1668
01:25:17.754 --> 01:25:21.056
The specific subjects and
questions were chosen by me


1669
01:25:21.090 --> 01:25:23.359
and have not been
shared or cleared


1670
01:25:23.394 --> 01:25:25.895
with anyone on the campaigns
or on the commission.


1671
01:25:25.930 --> 01:25:27.930
The audience
here in the hall


1672
01:25:27.965 --> 01:25:30.533
has promised to remain
very polite--


1673
01:25:30.568 --> 01:25:34.404
no cheers, applause,
no untoward outbursts...


1674
01:25:34.438 --> 01:25:36.739
- Biden. Biden. Biden.
- ...Except right at this minute


1675
01:25:36.773 --> 01:25:40.443
as we welcome Governor Palin
and Senator Biden.


1676
01:25:48.385 --> 01:25:50.886
Nice to meet you.
Hey, can I call you Joe?


1677
01:25:50.920 --> 01:25:53.790
You can call me Joe.

1678
01:25:53.823 --> 01:25:56.560
- Why-- why is the mic on?
- No, no, no, it's cool.


1679
01:25:56.595 --> 01:25:58.060
They're gonna think
it's some kind


1680
01:25:58.095 --> 01:26:00.864
of Machiavellian
Jedi power-play.


1681
01:26:00.899 --> 01:26:03.000
From your lips, Steve.

1682
01:26:03.034 --> 01:26:04.467
Welcome to you both.

1683
01:26:04.502 --> 01:26:07.036
The House of representatives
this week passed a bill,


1684
01:26:07.070 --> 01:26:08.505
a big bail-out bill--

1685
01:26:08.538 --> 01:26:10.039
or didn't pass it,
I should say.


1686
01:26:10.073 --> 01:26:11.808
The senate decided
to pass it


1687
01:26:11.842 --> 01:26:13.711
and the house is wrestling
with it still tonight.


1688
01:26:13.745 --> 01:26:17.080
Was this the worst of Washington
or the best of Washington


1689
01:26:17.115 --> 01:26:18.582
that we saw play out?

1690
01:26:18.617 --> 01:26:20.883
Thank you, Gwen, and I thank
the commission also.


1691
01:26:20.918 --> 01:26:23.019
I appreciate this privilege
of being able to be here


1692
01:26:23.053 --> 01:26:24.520
and speak with Americans.

1693
01:26:24.554 --> 01:26:26.823
Please, God, be kind.

1694
01:26:26.857 --> 01:26:28.724
You know, I think
a good barometer here


1695
01:26:28.758 --> 01:26:31.295
when we're trying to figure out
has this been a good time


1696
01:26:31.330 --> 01:26:34.932
or a bad time
in America's economy is...


1697
01:26:34.966 --> 01:26:37.200
Go to a kids' soccer game
on Saturday


1698
01:26:37.234 --> 01:26:40.203
and turn to any parent there
on the sideline and ask them,


1699
01:26:40.237 --> 01:26:42.071
"how are you feeling
about the economy?"


1700
01:26:42.105 --> 01:26:43.673
And I'll betcha
you're gonna hear


1701
01:26:43.708 --> 01:26:46.075
some fear in
that parent's voice...


1702
01:26:46.109 --> 01:26:48.480
She's doing great.

1703
01:26:48.513 --> 01:26:50.280
We've got 88 more minutes.

1704
01:26:50.315 --> 01:26:53.683
...Did we just take a major
hit with those investments?


1705
01:26:53.718 --> 01:26:57.086
There is something to be said
also for man's activities,


1706
01:26:57.120 --> 01:27:00.824
but also for the cyclical
temperature changes on our planet.


1707
01:27:00.858 --> 01:27:03.861
Senator, what is true and
what is false about the causes?


1708
01:27:03.895 --> 01:27:07.030
If you don't understand
what the cause is,


1709
01:27:07.065 --> 01:27:09.532
it's virtually impossible
to come up with a solution.


1710
01:27:09.567 --> 01:27:12.535
The chant is
"drill, baby, drill."


1711
01:27:12.570 --> 01:27:15.339
And that's what we hear
all across this country


1712
01:27:15.374 --> 01:27:18.107
in our rallies,
because people are so hungry


1713
01:27:18.141 --> 01:27:20.544
for those domestic
sources of energy


1714
01:27:20.579 --> 01:27:22.580
to be tapped into.

1715
01:27:22.614 --> 01:27:24.247
We will end this war.

1716
01:27:24.281 --> 01:27:25.682
For John McCain,

1717
01:27:25.716 --> 01:27:28.853
there is no end in sight
to end this war.


1718
01:27:28.886 --> 01:27:31.153
We will end this war.

1719
01:27:31.188 --> 01:27:33.256
Governor...

1720
01:27:33.290 --> 01:27:36.727
Um... your plan

1721
01:27:36.762 --> 01:27:39.129
is a white flag
of surrender


1722
01:27:39.163 --> 01:27:40.898
- in Iraq.
- Whoo! Yes!


1723
01:27:42.366 --> 01:27:44.001
Governor, please,
did you want to respond


1724
01:27:44.034 --> 01:27:45.936
to Senator McCain's
comments about healthcare?


1725
01:27:45.970 --> 01:27:47.605
Pivot. Pivot!

1726
01:27:47.639 --> 01:27:50.440
I'd like to respond about
the tax increases and...


1727
01:27:50.474 --> 01:27:52.376
Yes!

1728
01:27:52.411 --> 01:27:54.913
Darn right,
we need tax relief


1729
01:27:54.947 --> 01:27:57.281
for Americans so that jobs
can be created here.


1730
01:27:57.315 --> 01:27:59.283
Barack Obama
and Senator O'Biden,


1731
01:27:59.317 --> 01:28:01.284
you said no
to everything...


1732
01:28:01.318 --> 01:28:03.019
She just said O'Biden.

1733
01:28:03.054 --> 01:28:04.622
We're probably the
only ones that heard it.


1734
01:28:04.655 --> 01:28:06.823
It was Ronald Reagan
who said


1735
01:28:06.858 --> 01:28:09.692
that freedom is always
just one generation away


1736
01:28:09.727 --> 01:28:11.062
from extinction.

1737
01:28:11.096 --> 01:28:15.065
We don't pass it to our
children in the bloodstream.


1738
01:28:15.099 --> 01:28:18.803
We have to fight for it
and protect it,


1739
01:28:18.837 --> 01:28:20.404
and then hand it to them

1740
01:28:20.439 --> 01:28:22.873
so that they
will do the same.


1741
01:28:22.908 --> 01:28:24.909
We will fight for it.

1742
01:28:24.943 --> 01:28:27.444
And there is only
one man in this race


1743
01:28:27.478 --> 01:28:29.747
who has really ever
fought for you,


1744
01:28:29.781 --> 01:28:32.349
and that's Senator
John McCain.


1745
01:28:38.322 --> 01:28:40.189
Okay, here we go.

1746
01:28:40.223 --> 01:28:42.460
CBS instant poll
says undecideds


1747
01:28:42.493 --> 01:28:46.430
give the debate
to Biden, 46%; Palin, 21.


1748
01:28:46.465 --> 01:28:48.767
Fuck CBS and fuck
their instant poll.


1749
01:28:48.801 --> 01:28:50.400
This is the greatest
debate victory


1750
01:28:50.436 --> 01:28:51.801
in the history
of the Republic.


1751
01:28:51.836 --> 01:28:53.804
Okay!

1752
01:28:59.009 --> 01:29:02.746
You see? You just
had to be you.


1753
01:29:04.549 --> 01:29:06.351
I'm gonna grab a beer.

1754
01:29:06.385 --> 01:29:08.919
- Want one?
- No.


1755
01:29:08.954 --> 01:29:12.756
Senator McCain wanted me
to congratulate you


1756
01:29:12.790 --> 01:29:14.557
on a fantastic debate.

1757
01:29:14.592 --> 01:29:17.460
- You really did a great job.
- Thanks.


1758
01:29:17.495 --> 01:29:21.165
Tell John I want to bring up
Bill Ayers and reverend Wright.


1759
01:29:21.199 --> 01:29:23.534
I think it's time
to go for the jugular.


1760
01:29:23.568 --> 01:29:26.904
Uh, you'll have to discuss
that with your running mate.


1761
01:29:26.938 --> 01:29:30.273
He made it very clear that he
doesn't want to touch Wright.


1762
01:29:30.308 --> 01:29:32.675
I'll talk to him about it.

1763
01:29:32.710 --> 01:29:34.645
We have to win this thing.

1764
01:29:34.678 --> 01:29:37.115
I so don't want to go
back to Alaska.


1765
01:29:38.582 --> 01:29:40.784
Hmm.

1766
01:29:43.488 --> 01:29:45.890
Stevie.

1767
01:29:45.924 --> 01:29:48.659
You know, I think the worst
of this thing might be over.


1768
01:29:48.693 --> 01:29:50.093
All she's got left
are speeches.


1769
01:29:50.128 --> 01:29:52.697
There's no more debates,
no major interviews.


1770
01:29:52.732 --> 01:29:55.533
Yeah. We're doing great.

1771
01:29:58.102 --> 01:30:01.604
This was an unbelievable win
for Sarah Palin.


1772
01:30:01.639 --> 01:30:05.943
In fact, I think that
it unveiled a level of skill


1773
01:30:05.977 --> 01:30:08.780
in communication that
I really have not seen


1774
01:30:08.814 --> 01:30:10.781
since Ronald Reagan.

1775
01:30:10.815 --> 01:30:12.917
She is a superstar.

1776
01:30:12.950 --> 01:30:14.652
- Her ability to by--

1777
01:30:14.686 --> 01:30:16.654
And she sure is
a breath of fresh air.


1778
01:30:16.688 --> 01:30:18.121
I mean, I think people want

1779
01:30:18.156 --> 01:30:19.623
someone from
outside of Washington.


1780
01:30:19.658 --> 01:30:21.224
She sounded like the future.

1781
01:30:21.259 --> 01:30:22.626
Oh, come on, honey.

1782
01:30:22.661 --> 01:30:24.094
Why don't you
get some sleep?


1783
01:30:24.128 --> 01:30:25.965
One sec, okay?

1784
01:30:25.998 --> 01:30:28.066
...Turned around.
I think she has done it


1785
01:30:28.099 --> 01:30:31.035
in the sense that of the
four debaters we've seen,


1786
01:30:31.069 --> 01:30:34.137
she was the most interesting,
attractive of them all.


1787
01:30:34.172 --> 01:30:36.875
- She is personable...
- I can still win this thing.


1788
01:30:36.909 --> 01:30:38.375
...She's got
a sense of humor.


1789
01:30:38.409 --> 01:30:39.877
She looked straight
into the camera


1790
01:30:39.911 --> 01:30:42.480
while Joe's
talking to Gwen...


1791
01:30:45.718 --> 01:30:48.752
This map is now lopsided
in favor of Barack Obama.


1792
01:30:48.787 --> 01:30:50.387
John McCain pulling
out of Michigan.


1793
01:30:50.421 --> 01:30:52.756
The first domino
in an economic debate


1794
01:30:52.792 --> 01:30:55.025
that if John McCain
does not turn around soon,


1795
01:30:55.060 --> 01:30:56.694
many see more blue
on this map


1796
01:30:56.728 --> 01:30:58.296
and more trouble
for John McCain.


1797
01:30:58.330 --> 01:30:59.998
Yesterday, it was
announced that the campaign


1798
01:31:00.032 --> 01:31:01.799
is going to leave Michigan
to Obama to win.


1799
01:31:01.833 --> 01:31:04.068
- What's going on there?
- I read that this morning also,


1800
01:31:04.103 --> 01:31:05.535
and I fired off
a quick e-mail


1801
01:31:05.570 --> 01:31:07.505
and I said, "oh, come on!
Do we have to?"


1802
01:31:07.539 --> 01:31:09.240
Do we have to
call it there?"


1803
01:31:09.274 --> 01:31:12.110
I want to go back to Michigan,
and I want to try.


1804
01:31:12.144 --> 01:31:14.011
What the fuck?

1805
01:31:14.045 --> 01:31:15.779
McCain had hoped to
just score a pick-up.


1806
01:31:15.814 --> 01:31:18.248
We made the decision to pull
the ads out of Michigan


1807
01:31:18.282 --> 01:31:19.718
because we can't win there.

1808
01:31:19.752 --> 01:31:21.118
We need the money
in Pennsylvania


1809
01:31:21.152 --> 01:31:24.422
- and Ohio.
- You're making a big mistake.


1810
01:31:24.455 --> 01:31:26.624
You know, I know I'm not
an expert like yourself,


1811
01:31:26.658 --> 01:31:29.093
but seeing as we're
seven points out,


1812
01:31:29.127 --> 01:31:31.193
I don't see why
the vice presidential campaign


1813
01:31:31.228 --> 01:31:32.731
can't make a quick stop there

1814
01:31:32.765 --> 01:31:34.131
in the middle of the night.

1815
01:31:34.165 --> 01:31:35.533
And who are you
gonna meet with?


1816
01:31:35.567 --> 01:31:37.035
Your press corps
doesn't want


1817
01:31:37.068 --> 01:31:39.370
to hear you speak
at 3:00 in the morning.


1818
01:31:39.404 --> 01:31:42.306
And there's no such thing as
a vice presidential campaign.


1819
01:31:42.341 --> 01:31:44.208
This is
John McCain's campaign,


1820
01:31:44.242 --> 01:31:47.044
and this is the decision
that John McCain has made.


1821
01:31:47.078 --> 01:31:49.914
You must stick
to the script, Governor.


1822
01:31:49.949 --> 01:31:52.683
And what script
is that, Steve?


1823
01:31:52.718 --> 01:31:54.252
'Cause I haven't seen
anything resembling


1824
01:31:54.286 --> 01:31:58.623
a script this entire
flippin' campaign.


1825
01:31:58.658 --> 01:32:01.159
When you publicly
contradict John McCain,


1826
01:32:01.193 --> 01:32:02.693
you hurt John McCain.

1827
01:32:02.727 --> 01:32:06.164
I know what I know
what I know.


1828
01:32:09.969 --> 01:32:11.803
And there you have it.

1829
01:32:13.639 --> 01:32:16.274
Afternoon, Governor.

1830
01:32:16.308 --> 01:32:18.442
This is a pro-stem cell ad?

1831
01:32:18.477 --> 01:32:20.844
Yes, Governor.
That's the Senator's position.


1832
01:32:20.879 --> 01:32:23.749
Yeah, it's not my position.
I'm not saying it.


1833
01:32:23.783 --> 01:32:25.083
I thought that--

1834
01:32:25.117 --> 01:32:27.519
you guys should have shown
me the script ahead of time.


1835
01:32:27.553 --> 01:32:30.354
This is a waste of my time.

1836
01:32:33.025 --> 01:32:34.858
Why wasn't I informed
that Jeb Bradley


1837
01:32:34.893 --> 01:32:36.459
is appearing with me
at the rally?


1838
01:32:36.494 --> 01:32:38.295
I don't think we foresaw
that being a problem.


1839
01:32:38.329 --> 01:32:40.900
I just googled him.
He's pro-choice.


1840
01:32:40.934 --> 01:32:45.870
There's no way I'm going onstage
with anyone who's pro-choice.


1841
01:32:45.905 --> 01:32:48.473
Bradley's gone
or I'm gone, period.


1842
01:32:48.508 --> 01:32:49.742
Yes, Governor.

1843
01:32:49.776 --> 01:32:53.578
The RNC spent
a stunning $150,000


1844
01:32:53.612 --> 01:32:56.548
on clothes for Governor
Sarah Palin and her family


1845
01:32:56.582 --> 01:32:59.283
according to the federal
election commission reports.


1846
01:32:59.318 --> 01:33:01.252
The revelation
that so much money


1847
01:33:01.286 --> 01:33:03.189
was spent at fancy
clothing stores


1848
01:33:03.223 --> 01:33:05.423
like Neiman Marcus
and Saks Fifth Avenue


1849
01:33:05.457 --> 01:33:07.692
could be a huge blow
to the governor's image


1850
01:33:07.727 --> 01:33:10.262
as an everyday,
average American.


1851
01:33:10.296 --> 01:33:12.097
Several republican donors

1852
01:33:12.131 --> 01:33:13.998
have publicly
expressed outrage...


1853
01:33:14.034 --> 01:33:16.768
- You watching this?
- Yeah, I'm watching.


1854
01:33:16.802 --> 01:33:18.404
Un-fucking-believable.

1855
01:33:18.439 --> 01:33:20.171
Why didn't you people tell me

1856
01:33:20.206 --> 01:33:21.473
these clothes
cost this much?


1857
01:33:21.507 --> 01:33:23.242
It wasn't just
your clothes, Governor.


1858
01:33:23.276 --> 01:33:25.777
It was also for the kids,
Todd and your parents.


1859
01:33:25.811 --> 01:33:27.446
I want 'Em gone.

1860
01:33:27.480 --> 01:33:29.681
Get 'Em out of here.

1861
01:33:29.716 --> 01:33:32.619
You know, I buy my clothes
at consignment shops.


1862
01:33:32.653 --> 01:33:36.289
I never wanted this fancy crap
in the first place.


1863
01:33:36.323 --> 01:33:38.023
Hey, thanks for coming out.

1864
01:33:38.058 --> 01:33:39.957
Hey. Hi, nice to meet you.

1865
01:33:39.992 --> 01:33:42.460
- How are you? Hey, hi.
- Governor Palin,


1866
01:33:42.494 --> 01:33:44.062
what's your response
to the findings


1867
01:33:44.096 --> 01:33:45.731
that the Alaska state
legislature's report


1868
01:33:45.765 --> 01:33:47.467
on your involvement
in the troopergate scandal?


1869
01:33:47.500 --> 01:33:49.702
I was thrilled to be
cleared of all wrongdoing.


1870
01:33:49.737 --> 01:33:51.371
You know you're not
supposed to be here.


1871
01:33:51.405 --> 01:33:54.039
Go back to the press risers,
please. Thank you.


1872
01:33:54.074 --> 01:33:56.876
You can't say you were
cleared of all wrongdoing.


1873
01:33:56.910 --> 01:33:59.011
- Why not?
- Because you weren't.


1874
01:33:59.045 --> 01:34:01.914
The report stated that
you abused your power.


1875
01:34:01.948 --> 01:34:04.584
That is the opposite of being
cleared of all wrongdoing.


1876
01:34:04.618 --> 01:34:07.020
- Then why was I told otherwise?
- You weren't told otherwise.


1877
01:34:07.054 --> 01:34:08.454
And why haven't you
released a statement


1878
01:34:08.490 --> 01:34:09.923
saying that Todd
was never a member


1879
01:34:09.957 --> 01:34:11.224
of the Alaska
independence party?


1880
01:34:11.259 --> 01:34:14.559
Because that would be untrue.
He was a member.


1881
01:34:14.594 --> 01:34:16.395
He checked the wrong box.

1882
01:34:16.429 --> 01:34:17.963
He registered by accident,

1883
01:34:17.998 --> 01:34:19.999
and rectified the error
immediately.


1884
01:34:20.033 --> 01:34:21.835
He was a member
for seven years!


1885
01:34:21.869 --> 01:34:24.271
I'm sorry,
Governor, but...


1886
01:34:24.305 --> 01:34:26.339
There is only a few weeks
left in this campaign.


1887
01:34:26.373 --> 01:34:28.507
You have got to stop
saying things to the press


1888
01:34:28.541 --> 01:34:29.943
that are blatantly untrue.

1889
01:34:29.976 --> 01:34:32.577
That is not the kind of campaign
that we are running here.


1890
01:34:32.612 --> 01:34:35.816
"Campaign"-- is that what
you're calling this now?


1891
01:34:35.850 --> 01:34:38.985
Governor, I admit that this
is a dysfunctional campaign,


1892
01:34:39.020 --> 01:34:40.454
but that is what I inherited,

1893
01:34:40.487 --> 01:34:43.424
and I am doing my level best
to help us win this election.


1894
01:34:43.457 --> 01:34:44.991
And that's what
I'm trying to do, too,


1895
01:34:45.026 --> 01:34:46.591
and all you're doing
is screwing me up.


1896
01:34:46.627 --> 01:34:49.528
That's all you've done this
entire time, is get in my way.


1897
01:34:49.563 --> 01:34:51.698
Oh, oh.

1898
01:34:51.732 --> 01:34:54.668
And I am raising millions of
dollars for this campaign.


1899
01:34:54.703 --> 01:34:56.502
Hundreds of thousands
of people are coming


1900
01:34:56.537 --> 01:34:58.571
to see me speak, not John
McCain, God bless him.


1901
01:34:58.605 --> 01:34:59.972
They are coming to see me.

1902
01:35:00.006 --> 01:35:04.277
So if I am single-handedly
carrying this campaign,


1903
01:35:04.312 --> 01:35:06.512
I'm gonna do what I want.

1904
01:35:19.126 --> 01:35:21.793
Sarah! Sarah! Sarah!

1905
01:35:27.268 --> 01:35:30.838
Several McCain advisors
tell CNN they're annoyed


1906
01:35:30.873 --> 01:35:34.040
by what one aide called
"Palin going rogue."


1907
01:35:34.075 --> 01:35:36.243
God damn it.

1908
01:35:36.277 --> 01:35:37.978
I hate it when there's
leaking and backstabbing


1909
01:35:38.012 --> 01:35:41.214
after a campaign, let alone
before it's fucking over.


1910
01:35:41.249 --> 01:35:44.184
I need you to step in
and talk to her.


1911
01:35:44.218 --> 01:35:47.488
I don't know, Stevie boy.
I don't know.


1912
01:35:47.522 --> 01:35:50.323
Sir...

1913
01:35:50.358 --> 01:35:52.658
I can't control her any more.

1914
01:35:55.696 --> 01:35:57.964
I don't know if she's
getting on a campaign plane


1915
01:35:57.999 --> 01:36:00.066
in the morning or what
she's gonna say at night.


1916
01:36:00.101 --> 01:36:03.070
We need to finish
this campaign


1917
01:36:03.105 --> 01:36:05.038
with as much dignity
as possible,


1918
01:36:05.072 --> 01:36:06.806
and the only way
that can happen


1919
01:36:06.840 --> 01:36:08.708
is if you get her in line.

1920
01:36:11.746 --> 01:36:13.880
That's not gonna
do it, Steve.


1921
01:36:13.915 --> 01:36:16.516
She might start
turning on me.


1922
01:36:28.463 --> 01:36:30.763
Most of these polls
have us trailing


1923
01:36:30.798 --> 01:36:32.766
five to eight points.

1924
01:36:32.800 --> 01:36:35.170
- So what now?
- John...


1925
01:36:35.204 --> 01:36:37.203
I mean, these numbers
do show it.


1926
01:36:37.238 --> 01:36:39.873
We've got to make this
about Obama.


1927
01:36:39.908 --> 01:36:41.442
We've got to get tough

1928
01:36:41.476 --> 01:36:43.376
and we've got
to get negative.


1929
01:36:43.411 --> 01:36:45.413
If we go this way,

1930
01:36:45.446 --> 01:36:49.316
reverend Wright is still
the best play we have.


1931
01:36:50.484 --> 01:36:53.387
Any of you
ever been accused


1932
01:36:53.421 --> 01:36:57.791
of having a negro child
out of wedlock


1933
01:36:57.826 --> 01:37:01.527
because your adopted daughter
was born in Bangladesh?


1934
01:37:02.431 --> 01:37:04.030
And then when she was 16

1935
01:37:04.065 --> 01:37:07.400
and googled her name,
I had to explain to her


1936
01:37:07.436 --> 01:37:11.104
why President Bush's henchmen
called her a bastard


1937
01:37:11.138 --> 01:37:13.673
when she was 10 years old.

1938
01:37:13.707 --> 01:37:16.977
Yeah, listen, South Carolina--
that was an ugly primary,


1939
01:37:17.011 --> 01:37:18.479
but this isn't
the same thing.


1940
01:37:18.513 --> 01:37:21.015
I mean, reverend Wright
really did say those things.


1941
01:37:21.049 --> 01:37:23.484
That may be true.

1942
01:37:23.518 --> 01:37:27.054
But there is a dark side
to American populism.


1943
01:37:27.088 --> 01:37:30.358
Some people win elections
by tapping into it.


1944
01:37:32.126 --> 01:37:34.895
I'm not one of those people.

1945
01:37:34.929 --> 01:37:39.265
Okay.
So what about Bill Ayers?


1946
01:37:39.301 --> 01:37:41.267
Obama began his career

1947
01:37:41.302 --> 01:37:43.504
in the living room
of a domestic terrorist.


1948
01:37:43.538 --> 01:37:47.274
Domestic terrorist.
Nothing to do with race.


1949
01:37:52.514 --> 01:37:54.882
Yeah, okay.

1950
01:37:54.916 --> 01:37:57.351
Ayers is fair.

1951
01:37:57.385 --> 01:37:59.854
Okay. Who ouould do this?

1952
01:37:59.888 --> 01:38:02.523
And Barack held
one of the first meetings


1953
01:38:02.557 --> 01:38:06.594
of his political career
in Bill Ayers' living room.


1954
01:38:08.897 --> 01:38:11.798
Pallin' around
with terrorists.


1955
01:38:13.467 --> 01:38:15.235
He's not a Christian!

1956
01:38:15.269 --> 01:38:17.971
And I am just so fearful

1957
01:38:18.006 --> 01:38:20.342
that this is not a man

1958
01:38:20.376 --> 01:38:22.977
who sees America

1959
01:38:23.012 --> 01:38:27.582
- the way that you and I see America--
- He's a socialist!


1960
01:38:27.616 --> 01:38:33.620
As the greatest source
for good in this world.


1961
01:38:36.391 --> 01:38:38.724
U.S.A.! U.S.A.!

1962
01:38:38.759 --> 01:38:41.495
U.S.A.! U.S.A.! U.S.A.!

1963
01:38:41.529 --> 01:38:44.398
What does Barack
Obama plan for America?


1964
01:38:44.433 --> 01:38:46.599
Nothing!

1965
01:38:46.633 --> 01:38:50.138
In short, who is
the real Barack Obama?


1966
01:38:50.173 --> 01:38:53.274
A terrorist!

1967
01:38:53.307 --> 01:38:55.142
We believe that
the best of America


1968
01:38:55.177 --> 01:38:58.679
is not all in Washington,
D.C. we believe--


1969
01:39:02.616 --> 01:39:05.886
we believe that
the best of America


1970
01:39:05.920 --> 01:39:08.921
is in these small towns
that we get to visit


1971
01:39:08.957 --> 01:39:11.325
and in these wonderful
little pockets


1972
01:39:11.359 --> 01:39:13.694
of what I call
the real America.


1973
01:39:13.728 --> 01:39:16.430
- Yes!
- Yeah!


1974
01:39:17.331 --> 01:39:20.867
Sarah! Sarah!

1975
01:39:26.141 --> 01:39:28.476
For a man who's
written two memoirs,


1976
01:39:28.510 --> 01:39:29.977
he's no open book.

1977
01:39:30.011 --> 01:39:32.513
You got that right.

1978
01:39:32.547 --> 01:39:35.048
What does Barack Obama
see for America?


1979
01:39:35.083 --> 01:39:36.550
He's a Muslim!

1980
01:39:36.585 --> 01:39:38.085
He's a socialist!

1981
01:39:38.120 --> 01:39:40.488
- He doesn't represent us!
- He doesn't belong here!


1982
01:39:40.522 --> 01:39:42.856
He hangs out with people
who hate our country.


1983
01:39:42.890 --> 01:39:45.726
- He's not American!
- Kill him!


1984
01:39:45.760 --> 01:39:49.296
Send him back to Africa!

1985
01:39:49.331 --> 01:39:51.132
Let me read to you, Tara,

1986
01:39:51.166 --> 01:39:54.034
what congressman John Lewis,
the civil rights icon,


1987
01:39:54.068 --> 01:39:56.536
said on Saturday
in a statement.


1988
01:39:56.570 --> 01:39:59.106
He said, "as one who was
a victim of violence"


1989
01:39:59.141 --> 01:40:01.376
and hate during the height
of the civil rights movement,


1990
01:40:01.410 --> 01:40:03.478
I am deeply disturbed
by the negative tone


1991
01:40:03.513 --> 01:40:05.479
of the McCain-Palin
campaign.


1992
01:40:05.514 --> 01:40:07.515
Senator McCain
and governor Palin"...


1993
01:40:07.549 --> 01:40:09.351
We gotta tone
the rhetoric down.


1994
01:40:09.385 --> 01:40:11.284
It's gotten out of control.

1995
01:40:11.318 --> 01:40:14.955
We can't even mention
Obama's name any more.


1996
01:40:14.989 --> 01:40:16.991
The crowd gets too hot.

1997
01:40:19.961 --> 01:40:23.063
This isn't the campaign
I wanted to run.


1998
01:40:24.467 --> 01:40:26.733
I can't trust Obama.

1999
01:40:26.768 --> 01:40:29.069
I've read about him,
and he's not a--


2000
01:40:29.103 --> 01:40:31.472
he's a-- he's a arab.

2001
01:40:31.506 --> 01:40:33.073
He's not an amer--

2002
01:40:33.107 --> 01:40:35.477
no, ma'am.

2003
01:40:35.511 --> 01:40:36.910
No, ma'am.

2004
01:40:36.944 --> 01:40:39.981
He's a decent
family-man citizen


2005
01:40:40.015 --> 01:40:42.150
who I just happen to have
disagreements with


2006
01:40:42.185 --> 01:40:44.518
on certain
fundamental issues.


2007
01:40:44.553 --> 01:40:47.656
And that's what this
campaign is all about.


2008
01:40:47.690 --> 01:40:50.425
He's not. Thank you.

2009
01:40:51.727 --> 01:40:53.294
Cutting through
the bull tonight,


2010
01:40:53.329 --> 01:40:54.829
on the Eve
of the election,


2011
01:40:54.863 --> 01:40:57.532
the campaigns are relying
on their lucky charms.


2012
01:40:57.567 --> 01:41:01.068
- Vodka rocks, lime.
- You got it.


2013
01:41:01.102 --> 01:41:02.536
How's he doing?

2014
01:41:02.571 --> 01:41:06.040
He's the most depressed I've
seen him the entire campaign.


2015
01:41:06.075 --> 01:41:09.177
I can't get him
to stop watching msnbc,


2016
01:41:09.211 --> 01:41:11.513
which only makes him
more miserable.


2017
01:41:12.915 --> 01:41:16.684
I'm amazed that someone
who has been in politics


2018
01:41:16.718 --> 01:41:19.420
this long takes
all the petty stuff


2019
01:41:19.454 --> 01:41:20.988
so personally.

2020
01:41:21.023 --> 01:41:23.725
And that's why they are
who they are.


2021
01:41:23.759 --> 01:41:25.594
Reagan, Bush, Clinton--

2022
01:41:25.628 --> 01:41:27.895
all they want
is to be loved.


2023
01:41:27.930 --> 01:41:30.633
The ones that don't
pathologically need to be loved,


2024
01:41:30.666 --> 01:41:32.300
they don't get
the nomination.


2025
01:41:32.334 --> 01:41:33.900
They don't get
to be president.


2026
01:41:33.935 --> 01:41:35.502
If you'd understood
that fact,


2027
01:41:35.537 --> 01:41:38.440
you might have been able to better
handle our Alaskan moose hunter.


2028
01:41:40.008 --> 01:41:42.744
God, it was
a tough campaign.


2029
01:41:42.779 --> 01:41:45.780
It wasn't a campaign,
it was a bad reality show.


2030
01:41:45.814 --> 01:41:47.948
She didn't cost us
the election.


2031
01:41:47.982 --> 01:41:50.917
That was Bush.
That was the economy.


2032
01:41:50.952 --> 01:41:53.220
That was just
the cold hand of fate.


2033
01:41:53.256 --> 01:41:55.324
We didn't have a chance.

2034
01:41:55.359 --> 01:41:57.126
And if we did win,

2035
01:41:57.159 --> 01:42:00.829
would you feel comfortable
with president Palin?


2036
01:42:00.864 --> 01:42:02.731
Why not?
Then we would have won.


2037
01:42:04.600 --> 01:42:05.999
Come on, guys, listen.

2038
01:42:06.033 --> 01:42:08.535
I, too, wish that
the American people


2039
01:42:08.570 --> 01:42:10.738
would choose the future
Abraham Lincoln


2040
01:42:10.772 --> 01:42:13.141
or Thomas Jefferson,
but unfortunately,


2041
01:42:13.175 --> 01:42:14.942
that's not the way
it works any more.


2042
01:42:14.977 --> 01:42:18.080
Now it takes
movie star charisma


2043
01:42:18.114 --> 01:42:20.114
to get elected president.

2044
01:42:20.149 --> 01:42:24.117
And Obama and Palin, that's
what they are-- they're stars.


2045
01:42:24.152 --> 01:42:25.953
Primary difference being

2046
01:42:25.988 --> 01:42:28.991
Sarah Palin can't name
a supreme court decision,


2047
01:42:29.025 --> 01:42:31.225
whereas Barack Obama

2048
01:42:31.260 --> 01:42:33.262
was a constitutional
law Professor.


2049
01:42:33.297 --> 01:42:34.930
Fuck you.

2050
01:42:39.935 --> 01:42:41.503
You know what
Dick Cheney said


2051
01:42:41.537 --> 01:42:43.904
- when he found out we picked her?
- What?


2052
01:42:43.939 --> 01:42:47.208
He said we made
a reckless choice.


2053
01:42:47.242 --> 01:42:51.613
When you lose the moral
high ground to Dick Cheney,


2054
01:42:51.647 --> 01:42:54.316
it's time to re-think
your entire life.


2055
01:42:54.349 --> 01:42:56.284
Enough Cheney cracks, okay?

2056
01:42:56.319 --> 01:42:58.687
I mean, he's very
misunderstood.


2057
01:42:58.721 --> 01:43:00.188
How does he eat
when he's wearing


2058
01:43:00.222 --> 01:43:02.124
Darth Vader's
helmet, anyway?


2059
01:43:03.560 --> 01:43:04.960
There we go.

2060
01:43:04.994 --> 01:43:07.495
Gentlemen, let's wish
each other good luck.


2061
01:43:07.530 --> 01:43:09.698
Who knows,
we could have another


2062
01:43:09.732 --> 01:43:11.666
Dewey-Truman
situation here.


2063
01:43:11.701 --> 01:43:13.401
Always room for an upset.

2064
01:43:13.436 --> 01:43:16.304
Yeah, maybe I'll wake up
with a full head of hair.


2065
01:43:19.943 --> 01:43:22.578
You know, if we had just
asked for policy questions


2066
01:43:22.612 --> 01:43:25.513
in the briefing,
then we would have known.


2067
01:43:25.548 --> 01:43:28.082
I thought culvahouse was gonna
grill her during the vet.


2068
01:43:28.116 --> 01:43:30.719
Culvahouse thought
we were gonna grill her.


2069
01:43:32.087 --> 01:43:34.456
It haunts me.

2070
01:43:38.095 --> 01:43:40.529
After a hard-fought battle,

2071
01:43:40.564 --> 01:43:43.499
the nation's longest-running
presidential race


2072
01:43:43.533 --> 01:43:46.100
comes down to this day--
election day.


2073
01:43:46.134 --> 01:43:49.772
Voting is now underway
in all the lower 48 states


2074
01:43:49.806 --> 01:43:52.275
as we approach the end
of this historic election.


2075
01:43:52.309 --> 01:43:54.677
People lined up
across the country


2076
01:43:54.711 --> 01:43:56.445
by the millions today.

2077
01:43:56.480 --> 01:43:58.913
Turnout looks to be
the highest in decades.


2078
01:43:58.947 --> 01:44:02.650
John McCain will carry Kentucky
once again, as expected.


2079
01:44:02.685 --> 01:44:06.088
Eight electoral votes,
not a huge surprise.


2080
01:44:06.122 --> 01:44:08.490
We are not able
to make a projection


2081
01:44:08.524 --> 01:44:10.559
- in the four other states...

2082
01:44:10.594 --> 01:44:12.862
That are closing
all their polls


2083
01:44:12.896 --> 01:44:14.597
at this hour right now.

2084
01:44:14.631 --> 01:44:16.665
And some of them
are battleground states--


2085
01:44:16.700 --> 01:44:20.002
Georgia, Indiana,
South Carolina and Virginia.


2086
01:44:20.036 --> 01:44:23.170
It doesn't necessarily mean that
it's gonna be close or not...


2087
01:44:23.205 --> 01:44:26.376
Where's Virginia?

2088
01:44:26.411 --> 01:44:30.278
Negative five.
And Ohio's gone.


2089
01:44:30.312 --> 01:44:32.180
- Got it.
- I'll keep you posted.


2090
01:44:32.215 --> 01:44:34.115
Call you in 10.

2091
01:44:35.184 --> 01:44:36.752
What's going on?

2092
01:44:36.787 --> 01:44:39.288
We're gonna lose
Pennsylvania.


2093
01:44:39.322 --> 01:44:41.356
And Ohio.

2094
01:44:43.294 --> 01:44:44.992
Steve...

2095
01:44:45.027 --> 01:44:48.997
There's something
I have to tell you.


2096
01:44:49.032 --> 01:44:52.000
What's wrong?

2097
01:44:52.035 --> 01:44:54.069
I didn't vote.

2098
01:44:54.103 --> 01:44:56.572
I couldn't do it.

2099
01:44:56.606 --> 01:44:59.207
I didn't vote.

2100
01:45:02.145 --> 01:45:03.612
I couldn't do it.

2101
01:45:03.647 --> 01:45:05.614
It's okay.

2102
01:45:05.649 --> 01:45:07.249
- Soledad.
- All right, Wolf,


2103
01:45:07.283 --> 01:45:09.351
we'll take you right to
the voter analysis...


2104
01:45:11.254 --> 01:45:13.388
How we doing,
Stevie boy?


2105
01:45:16.793 --> 01:45:19.795
We lost Pennsylvania
and Ohio, sir.


2106
01:45:38.349 --> 01:45:41.183
When my grandfather

2107
01:45:41.218 --> 01:45:46.054
found out that the Japanese
had surrendered,


2108
01:45:46.089 --> 01:45:47.856
he was lost.

2109
01:45:47.890 --> 01:45:51.260
He didn't know
what to do with himself.


2110
01:45:51.295 --> 01:45:53.930
He came home,

2111
01:45:53.965 --> 01:45:56.399
dropped dead
the very next day.


2112
01:45:59.135 --> 01:46:02.872
Fought his war,
then he died.


2113
01:46:04.407 --> 01:46:06.108
And my dad,

2114
01:46:06.142 --> 01:46:09.846
when he retired
from the Navy,


2115
01:46:09.881 --> 01:46:12.415
he fell into
a sense of despair


2116
01:46:12.449 --> 01:46:14.751
for the rest of his life.

2117
01:46:21.558 --> 01:46:24.160
I'm never gonna quit, Steve.

2118
01:46:25.595 --> 01:46:27.262
I can't.

2119
01:46:30.735 --> 01:46:32.669
I don't know how
to just fade away.


2120
01:46:36.239 --> 01:46:38.206
Senator, I--

2121
01:46:38.241 --> 01:46:40.243
I just want to say--

2122
01:46:46.584 --> 01:46:48.518
What?

2123
01:46:50.888 --> 01:46:53.321
I'm s-
- I'm s--

2124
01:46:53.356 --> 01:46:55.691
I'm so sorry that I...

2125
01:46:56.660 --> 01:46:59.328
Suggested her.

2126
01:47:01.732 --> 01:47:03.433
Don't be.

2127
01:47:04.902 --> 01:47:06.603
Fuck 'Em.

2128
01:47:08.171 --> 01:47:11.006
What were
we supposed to do?


2129
01:47:11.041 --> 01:47:13.977
A truly historic night
here in the United States.


2130
01:47:14.011 --> 01:47:15.378
Barack Obama will become

2131
01:47:15.412 --> 01:47:17.581
the 44th president
of the United States.


2132
01:47:17.616 --> 01:47:19.549
Sorry, mom.

2133
01:47:19.584 --> 01:47:21.385
Oh, thanks, kiddo.

2134
01:47:21.419 --> 01:47:24.152
I'm really sorry, mom.

2135
01:47:24.187 --> 01:47:25.921
Sweetheart.

2136
01:47:25.956 --> 01:47:28.390
You did great.
You know that, right?


2137
01:47:28.424 --> 01:47:29.892
- Yeah.
- Okay?


2138
01:47:29.926 --> 01:47:31.695
Come here, baby.

2139
01:47:31.729 --> 01:47:35.164
- It's all right. We're okay. Yeah.
- Yeah.


2140
01:47:37.402 --> 01:47:40.502
I'll take the stress
very literally here.


2141
01:47:40.536 --> 01:47:42.671
Just one quick-- you think?

2142
01:47:42.706 --> 01:47:45.608
And on this next part, would
you make sure you bold that?


2143
01:47:45.642 --> 01:47:48.779
Oh, Chris, I need you to load
this in the teleprompter for me.


2144
01:47:48.814 --> 01:47:50.580
Steve Schmidt told me
you weren't making a speech.


2145
01:47:50.615 --> 01:47:54.350
No. I am making a speech.

2146
01:47:54.384 --> 01:47:55.919
Scully cleared it
with Rick Davis.


2147
01:47:55.953 --> 01:47:57.753
So just go ahead
and load it, okay?


2148
01:47:57.787 --> 01:47:59.723
Okay.

2149
01:48:02.559 --> 01:48:06.930
Okay, so, on the stress
on this one, I'll take it.


2150
01:48:06.964 --> 01:48:09.099
- Jesus!
- Hey, sorry.


2151
01:48:09.134 --> 01:48:11.200
Steve, I'm getting a bunch
of mixed messages here.


2152
01:48:11.236 --> 01:48:13.235
Is the Governor giving
a concession speech or not--


2153
01:48:13.269 --> 01:48:15.905
I've already said this
five times already.


2154
01:48:15.940 --> 01:48:17.707
She is not giving a speech.

2155
01:48:17.742 --> 01:48:19.275
Well, she seems
to think otherwise.


2156
01:48:19.309 --> 01:48:21.311
Well, she's not.

2157
01:48:21.346 --> 01:48:22.946
What do you want me
to tell her?


2158
01:48:22.981 --> 01:48:25.716
Tell her she's not
fucking speaking!


2159
01:48:25.751 --> 01:48:27.451
Okay, well, you both
seem pretty certain--


2160
01:48:27.485 --> 01:48:30.219
well, let my certainty
supersede her certainty.


2161
01:48:30.254 --> 01:48:31.754
God damn it!

2162
01:48:36.259 --> 01:48:37.760
Steve.

2163
01:48:37.794 --> 01:48:39.763
You want to see me?

2164
01:48:39.797 --> 01:48:41.631
Yes. This way.

2165
01:48:49.506 --> 01:48:51.674
Excuse us a moment.

2166
01:48:59.051 --> 01:49:02.218
I understand you've prepared a speech.
Is that correct?


2167
01:49:02.252 --> 01:49:04.454
Yes, I have.
I want to salute John


2168
01:49:04.489 --> 01:49:06.455
for everything he's done
for this country.


2169
01:49:06.490 --> 01:49:10.292
It's not going to happen.
You're not giving a speech.


2170
01:49:10.327 --> 01:49:12.063
And why is that, Steve?

2171
01:49:12.097 --> 01:49:13.496
You're not giving a speech

2172
01:49:13.530 --> 01:49:15.465
because the vice
presidential candidate


2173
01:49:15.499 --> 01:49:19.402
has never given a concession
speech on election night.


2174
01:49:19.436 --> 01:49:21.305
It's not about you.

2175
01:49:21.339 --> 01:49:23.673
It's about the country.

2176
01:49:23.707 --> 01:49:26.608
Yeah, well, there's a lot of
things never been done before.


2177
01:49:28.645 --> 01:49:30.279
Governor...

2178
01:49:30.314 --> 01:49:32.116
This country
has just elected


2179
01:49:32.150 --> 01:49:34.617
the first African-
American president


2180
01:49:34.652 --> 01:49:36.552
in the history
of its existence.


2181
01:49:36.587 --> 01:49:38.488
And it is the concession speech

2182
01:49:38.523 --> 01:49:40.256
that will legitimize
his succession


2183
01:49:40.290 --> 01:49:42.391
as commander in chief.

2184
01:49:42.425 --> 01:49:44.894
It is a serious
and soleman occasion,


2185
01:49:44.928 --> 01:49:47.364
and John McCain,
and only John McCain,


2186
01:49:47.398 --> 01:49:50.433
will be giving
this sacred speech.


2187
01:49:50.467 --> 01:49:51.936
This is how it has been done

2188
01:49:51.970 --> 01:49:53.904
in every presidential election

2189
01:49:53.939 --> 01:49:55.739
since the dawn
of the Republic,


2190
01:49:55.773 --> 01:49:57.572
and you, Sarah Palin,

2191
01:49:57.607 --> 01:49:59.508
will not change
the importance


2192
01:49:59.543 --> 01:50:03.547
of this proud
American tradition.


2193
01:50:15.292 --> 01:50:18.963
"We fought-- we fought
as hard as we could."


2194
01:50:18.996 --> 01:50:20.597
And though we feel short,

2195
01:50:20.632 --> 01:50:22.867
"the fail--
the failure is mine."


2196
01:50:22.901 --> 01:50:25.002
Oh, jeez, no--

2197
01:50:25.036 --> 01:50:26.737
I don't feel
that short, Mark.


2198
01:50:26.772 --> 01:50:28.938
"Fell short," boss.

2199
01:50:28.973 --> 01:50:31.440
- Yeah, thanks.
- "Fell short." It's a typo.


2200
01:50:31.475 --> 01:50:35.344
- John.
- Hi, Sarah.


2201
01:50:36.948 --> 01:50:40.184
Well, we fought
the good fight.


2202
01:50:40.218 --> 01:50:42.820
Mm-hmm, we did.

2203
01:50:42.854 --> 01:50:46.189
Now I'm just gonna get out
there and thank America.


2204
01:50:46.223 --> 01:50:48.691
I can't wait to get
out there and thank you.


2205
01:50:48.725 --> 01:50:52.630
I have a speech written
that is a real tribute to ya.


2206
01:50:52.664 --> 01:50:56.566
No, I think these guys
have that covered.


2207
01:50:56.601 --> 01:50:57.902
Right, Steve?

2208
01:50:57.936 --> 01:50:59.436
Yes, sir.
We have it covered.


2209
01:50:59.470 --> 01:51:02.538
I just wanted people to know
what a great man you are.


2210
01:51:02.572 --> 01:51:04.174
I appreciate that,

2211
01:51:04.208 --> 01:51:06.510
but these guys got it
all worked out.


2212
01:51:06.543 --> 01:51:10.514
Yeah, you know, we probably
should get going now, sir, so...


2213
01:51:10.548 --> 01:51:12.216
All right. Good.

2214
01:51:14.520 --> 01:51:17.822
- Okay. We'll see you afterwards.
- I'll see you out there.


2215
01:51:29.535 --> 01:51:33.237
You're one of the leaders
of the party now, Sarah.


2216
01:51:33.271 --> 01:51:37.641
Don't get co-opted by Limbaugh
and the other extremists.


2217
01:51:37.674 --> 01:51:40.777
They'll destroy the party
if you let them.


2218
01:51:41.813 --> 01:51:44.014
Remember,
you're a hockey mom.


2219
01:51:44.049 --> 01:51:46.150
You just wanted
to make a difference,


2220
01:51:46.184 --> 01:51:48.118
and you did.

2221
01:51:48.153 --> 01:51:49.518
A big, huge difference.

2222
01:51:49.553 --> 01:51:52.021
I'll always be grateful.
Thank you.


2223
01:51:52.056 --> 01:51:54.157
- We should go, sir.
- Thank you, John.


2224
01:52:06.204 --> 01:52:08.873
My friends, we have--

2225
01:52:08.907 --> 01:52:11.175
we have come to the end
of a long journey.


2226
01:52:13.578 --> 01:52:16.347
The American people
have spoken,


2227
01:52:16.381 --> 01:52:18.716
and they have spoken clearly.

2228
01:52:18.751 --> 01:52:20.617
A little while ago,
I had the honor


2229
01:52:20.651 --> 01:52:22.753
of calling
Senator Barack Obama...


2230
01:52:22.787 --> 01:52:24.821
...To congrat--

2231
01:52:24.856 --> 01:52:26.957
please.

2232
01:52:26.992 --> 01:52:28.893
To congratulate him
on being elected


2233
01:52:28.927 --> 01:52:31.328
the next president
of the country we both love.


2234
01:52:35.768 --> 01:52:38.969
Whatever our differences,

2235
01:52:39.004 --> 01:52:41.139
we are fellow Americans.

2236
01:52:41.173 --> 01:52:44.174
Yes, sir!

2237
01:52:44.209 --> 01:52:47.045
I am so deeply
grateful to all of you


2238
01:52:47.078 --> 01:52:49.080
for the great honor
of your support


2239
01:52:49.115 --> 01:52:51.016
and all you have
done for me.


2240
01:52:53.419 --> 01:52:55.185
I am also, of course,

2241
01:52:55.220 --> 01:52:58.022
very thankful to
Governor Sarah Palin,


2242
01:52:58.056 --> 01:53:00.792
one of the best campaigners
I have ever seen.


2243
01:53:04.797 --> 01:53:07.534
Still think she's fit for office?

2244
01:53:07.568 --> 01:53:08.766
Eh, who cares?

2245
01:53:08.802 --> 01:53:11.002
In 48 hours, no one will
even remember who she is.


2246
01:53:11.037 --> 01:53:13.439
We can all look forward
with great interest


2247
01:53:13.473 --> 01:53:15.474
to her future service to Alaska,

2248
01:53:15.508 --> 01:53:18.944
the republican party
and our country.


2249
01:53:27.152 --> 01:53:31.189
Sarah! Sarah! Sarah!

2250
01:53:46.805 --> 01:53:50.375
There were numerous instances
of her saying things


2251
01:53:50.409 --> 01:53:51.844
that were not accurate

2252
01:53:51.877 --> 01:53:53.712
that opened the door
to criticism


2253
01:53:53.746 --> 01:53:56.881
that she was being
untruthful and inaccurate.


2254
01:53:56.914 --> 01:54:00.986
And I think that is something
that continues to this day.


2255
01:54:01.020 --> 01:54:02.554
And you think
that's fair criticism?


2256
01:54:02.589 --> 01:54:04.289
I think that's
fair criticism.


2257
01:54:04.323 --> 01:54:06.024
Early on, though,
you apparently said


2258
01:54:06.058 --> 01:54:07.526
she doesn't know anything.

2259
01:54:07.560 --> 01:54:10.361
In the immediate aftermath
of her selection,


2260
01:54:10.396 --> 01:54:14.065
it was clear to us
that we...


2261
01:54:14.100 --> 01:54:15.968
Had a lot of work to do.

2262
01:54:16.002 --> 01:54:18.971
For you, picking Sarah Palin
was about winning an election,


2263
01:54:19.005 --> 01:54:22.574
not necessarily about who's gonna
be best as vice president.


2264
01:54:22.609 --> 01:54:26.478
My job is to give
political advice.


2265
01:54:26.513 --> 01:54:28.746
We needed to do
something bold


2266
01:54:28.780 --> 01:54:30.715
to try to win the race.

2267
01:54:30.749 --> 01:54:32.818
If you had it
to do over again,


2268
01:54:32.852 --> 01:54:34.920
would you have her
on the ticket?


2269
01:54:39.258 --> 01:54:43.228
You don't get to go
back in time, Anderson,


2270
01:54:43.262 --> 01:54:47.900
and-- and have
do-overs in life.
