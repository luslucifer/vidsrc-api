1
00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:32.114
I would go out occasionally
to a cockail party,


2
00:00:32.202 --> 00:00:37.459
and I was fascinated by
all of what I saw there.


3
00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:39.304
There were a few guys
dancing with a few guys,


4
00:00:39.375 --> 00:00:42.527
a couple of gals dancing
with a couple gals.


5
00:00:42.645 --> 00:00:45.069
It was just a party,
and people were


6
00:00:45.148 --> 00:00:48.664
dancing and having a good time.

7
00:00:48.785 --> 00:00:50.549
Paries like this were illegal.

8
00:00:54.357 --> 00:00:57.680
And the nex think I
know the cops came in.


9
00:00:57.794 --> 00:01:00.389
Doors burst open,
there they were.


10
00:01:00.463 --> 00:01:02.921
They were arresting
a bunch of queers.


11
00:01:05.568 --> 00:01:10.222
They took us down to
the police station.


12
00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:15.836
I thought, oh, my
god, this is terrible.


13
00:01:15.912 --> 00:01:22.182
I thought, what would my mother
think of my being arrested?


14
00:01:22.252 --> 00:01:24.881
Will it affect this career
that I'm trying to get


15
00:01:24.988 --> 00:01:28.948
stared in the motion pictures?

16
00:01:29.025 --> 00:01:31.654
An attorney, Harry
Weiss, appeared.


17
00:01:31.728 --> 00:01:33.253
He was well known
for taking care


18
00:01:33.363 --> 00:01:35.821
of situations like that with
many, many Hollywood people.


19
00:01:38.768 --> 00:01:42.569
And he said, you've got to be
a lot sharper than you are.


20
00:01:42.672 --> 00:01:43.628
You're in Hollywood now.

21
00:01:43.706 --> 00:01:49.373
You want to be an actor and
really laid down the law to me.


22
00:01:49.445 --> 00:01:52.711
And then I was released.

23
00:01:52.782 --> 00:01:54.751
I had no idea it was
going to jump up and be


24
00:01:54.851 --> 00:01:58.538
thrown at me years later.

25
00:01:58.621 --> 00:02:00.112
He's the young fellow
you've been waiting for,


26
00:02:00.223 --> 00:02:04.092
ladies and gentlemen,
Tab Hunter.


27
00:02:04.193 --> 00:02:05.286
MAN: Six feet of
rugged manhood can


28
00:02:05.361 --> 00:02:06.943
stir the hear of every woman.

29
00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:09.727
Oh, my goodness,
I'm fabbergasted!


30
00:02:09.799 --> 00:02:10.482
Tab Hunter.

31
00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:11.761
MAN: How do you shave, Tab'?

32
00:02:11.868 --> 00:02:13.450
With Gillette Super
Speed of course.


33
00:02:13.536 --> 00:02:14.219
Tab Hunter!

34
00:02:15.471 --> 00:02:17.292
You tell me where I
can fne Tab Hunter.


35
00:02:17.407 --> 00:02:18.204
Well, you do pretty good.

36
00:02:18.274 --> 00:02:19.037
Gee, thanks.

37
00:02:19.108 --> 00:02:20.292
MAN: What do you like
about Tab Hunter?


38
00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:22.527
Well, (LAUGHING)
quite a few things.


39
00:02:23.446 --> 00:02:24.061
MAN (SINGING): That clean
cut, unaffected Tab Hunter.


40
00:02:24.147 --> 00:02:24.910
GIRLS: Tab!

41
00:02:27.116 --> 00:02:28.971
MAN (SINGING): That
All-American boy.


42
00:02:31.888 --> 00:02:34.676
Shocking, but true story of
a young man who found himself


43
00:02:34.757 --> 00:02:37.579
overwhelmed by a
strange compulsion.


44
00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:40.778
Hello, I'm Tab Hunter,
and I've got a secret.


45
00:02:40.897 --> 00:02:43.196
Well, I would never have
talked about my personal life


46
00:02:43.266 --> 00:02:44.928
in the 1950s.

47
00:02:45.001 --> 00:02:46.765
Something the matter, kid?

48
00:02:46.836 --> 00:02:47.519
What?

49
00:02:47.637 --> 00:02:48.320
Oh, no.

50
00:02:48.438 --> 00:02:49.690
No, not a thing.

51
00:02:49.772 --> 00:02:52.287
TAB HUNTER: I obviously
was very closeted.


52
00:02:52.408 --> 00:02:54.343
And I'm sure it's a
very diffcult thing


53
00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:56.675
to think, what's the problem?

54
00:02:56.746 --> 00:02:57.873
But there was a problem.

55
00:03:00.817 --> 00:03:02.843
It's been very diffcult
for me my whole life


56
00:03:02.952 --> 00:03:06.400
talking about that side of me.

57
00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:08.151
For me to come out
of myself like this


58
00:03:08.257 --> 00:03:11.409
and to share all of this
is exremely diffcult.


59
00:03:11.494 --> 00:03:13.520
I've never been as
open as I am with you


60
00:03:13.629 --> 00:03:16.952
because it's been written
about and what the heck?


61
00:03:17.033 --> 00:03:18.160
You know, I'm an old man.

62
00:03:18.267 --> 00:03:21.021
You know, this my
life-- big deal.


63
00:03:21.104 --> 00:03:30.696
(mum-nus)

64
00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:33.978
When I count three, will all
of the ladies in the audience


65
00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:36.474
please go, (SIGHING).

66
00:03:36.552 --> 00:03:38.578
Tab, when I was young,
when I frst saw him,


67
00:03:38.688 --> 00:03:44.480
looked-- beside acting, he
just was amazing looking.


68
00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:47.314
Whoa, this was like a
fying saucer landed looking


69
00:03:47.397 --> 00:03:52.324
like that cute-- beautiful,
California surfer,


70
00:03:52.402 --> 00:03:58.171
handsome that every single girl
or boy wanted to make out with.


71
00:03:58.241 --> 00:03:59.004
GIRL: Are you Tab Hunter'?

72
00:03:59.075 --> 00:03:59.906
Uh, yeah-- yeah.

73
00:04:00.009 --> 00:04:03.878
I think I've died
and gone to heaven.


74
00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:06.495
Kids and the fans
just gravitated to him


75
00:04:06.582 --> 00:04:08.562
just like a magnet.

76
00:04:08.684 --> 00:04:13.702
He was so popular, and so many
people just thought he was it.


77
00:04:13.823 --> 00:04:14.836
And he was.

78
00:04:14.924 --> 00:04:16.506
(LAUGHING) I'll bet.

79
00:04:16.592 --> 00:04:20.461
He was as big as
they could come.


80
00:04:20.563 --> 00:04:25.092
He had the star quality
and he had the x-factor.


81
00:04:25.201 --> 00:04:27.352
Mr. Tab Hunter
- Tab.

82
00:04:28.838 --> 00:04:32.525
And in every picture they
managed to take his shir off.


83
00:04:32.608 --> 00:04:33.974
(mum-nus)

84
00:04:34.076 --> 00:04:35.510
Hey, kid!

85
00:04:35.578 --> 00:04:38.002
Nobody could take their
eyes off Tab Hunter.


86
00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:42.074
He was the All-American boy, and
nobody sold that image better.


87
00:04:42.185 --> 00:04:44.165
He was the good-looking
sailor, or he


88
00:04:44.253 --> 00:04:46.677
was the good-looking Marine,
and he was the good-looking Air


89
00:04:46.756 --> 00:04:48.372
Force pilot.

90
00:04:48.458 --> 00:04:50.279
I did so many
military flms that I


91
00:04:50.393 --> 00:04:53.659
was waiting for the government
to send me a pension.


92
00:04:53.729 --> 00:04:56.517
I mean, my gosh, I was
in uniform all the time.


93
00:04:56.599 --> 00:04:57.578
Cigarette?

94
00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:00.067
I saw him in "Battle Cry."

95
00:05:00.136 --> 00:05:03.561
He played a young Marine
with Dorothy Malone.


96
00:05:03.639 --> 00:05:04.766
They did have a love scene.

97
00:05:08.277 --> 00:05:10.098
It caused a lot of
comment at the studio.


98
00:05:10.213 --> 00:05:11.579
Let's take a dip in the pool.

99
00:05:11.647 --> 00:05:13.627
We can't have one of
our young Marines having


100
00:05:13.749 --> 00:05:15.206
an affair with a married woman.

101
00:05:15.284 --> 00:05:16.411
Oh, really?

102
00:05:16.486 --> 00:05:17.169
(mum-nus)

103
00:05:17.286 --> 00:05:20.074
I think you're the most
beautiful woman I've ever met.


104
00:05:20.156 --> 00:05:22.671
What was the one he
did was Sophia Loren'?


105
00:05:22.792 --> 00:05:24.158
ANNOUNCER: "That
Kind of Woman--"


106
00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:27.458
"That Kind of Woman,"
yeah, and of course,


107
00:05:27.563 --> 00:05:31.011
I adored her too, and I
thought, ooh, what a couple.


108
00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:33.251
He doesn't look
old enough to drink.


109
00:05:33.336 --> 00:05:36.090
I'm old enough to do anything,

110
00:05:36.172 --> 00:05:41.361
With his charm and good looks
and his magnetic presence,


111
00:05:41.477 --> 00:05:46.074
he was the embodiment of
youthful American masculinity.


112
00:05:46.148 --> 00:05:47.514
Thank you very
much and thank you.


113
00:05:47.617 --> 00:05:50.132
There he goes, the eligible
bachelor from Hollywood.


114
00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:59.354
By now I'm used to
Tab Hunter, of course,


115
00:05:59.428 --> 00:06:01.397
after all these years.

116
00:06:01.464 --> 00:06:03.080
I grew up as Ar Gelien.

117
00:06:07.036 --> 00:06:12.532
I was born in 1931--
July, 11,1931.


118
00:06:12.642 --> 00:06:15.669
My mother's name
was Gerrude Gelien.


119
00:06:15.778 --> 00:06:19.260
She was from Hamburg, Germany.

120
00:06:19.348 --> 00:06:23.786
I always used to say she was
a poor-man's Marlene Dietrich.


121
00:06:23.853 --> 00:06:25.708
She had two children--
my older brother,


122
00:06:25.821 --> 00:06:30.441
Walt, who was 11
months older than me.


123
00:06:30.526 --> 00:06:32.290
My mother and father did
not get along at all.


124
00:06:32.361 --> 00:06:36.116
He was terribly abusive to her.

125
00:06:36.198 --> 00:06:38.383
Once my mother
left my father, it


126
00:06:38.501 --> 00:06:40.117
was a lot of burden,
a lot of stress


127
00:06:40.202 --> 00:06:44.640
for a single woman raising
two children in those days.


128
00:06:44.707 --> 00:06:46.562
She was very strict.

129
00:06:46.676 --> 00:06:48.656
One moment she could
be very explosive,


130
00:06:48.744 --> 00:06:53.432
and the other moment she could
be terribly tender and dear.


131
00:06:53.549 --> 00:06:56.519
My mother worked like a dog.

132
00:06:56.586 --> 00:06:59.909
She held, sometimes, two jobs.

133
00:07:00.022 --> 00:07:01.638
She wanted to create
an environment


134
00:07:01.724 --> 00:07:04.990
of a family and a
home, and that was very


135
00:07:05.061 --> 00:07:07.030
imporant to her and to us.

136
00:07:09.865 --> 00:07:15.031
I was lost as a kid in
many ways-- introvered.


137
00:07:15.104 --> 00:07:19.303
And I was exremely shy.

138
00:07:19.408 --> 00:07:22.674
I was never comforable
around people.


139
00:07:22.745 --> 00:07:24.839
It made me very nervous.

140
00:07:24.914 --> 00:07:27.941
My brother was
quite the opposite.


141
00:07:28.050 --> 00:07:29.746
My brother I looked
up to a great deal


142
00:07:29.852 --> 00:07:33.482
because he could handle
every situation very well.


143
00:07:33.556 --> 00:07:35.889
He was always prompting me on.

144
00:07:35.958 --> 00:07:38.655
Otherwise I'd have stayed in
my shell much, much longer.


145
00:07:41.964 --> 00:07:45.116
We were raised as Catholics.

146
00:07:45.234 --> 00:07:49.069
My mother put us in parochial
school, where we had nuns.


147
00:07:49.138 --> 00:07:51.403
She just was really,
really concerned


148
00:07:51.474 --> 00:07:53.898
about our own development--
mental, physical,


149
00:07:53.976 --> 00:07:56.946
and spiritual.

150
00:07:57.046 --> 00:07:59.470
I loved going to church.

151
00:07:59.548 --> 00:08:02.029
I did sing in the choir.

152
00:08:02.118 --> 00:08:05.873
Benediction was always wonderful
to me, and mass was in Latin,


153
00:08:05.955 --> 00:08:07.890
and I loved that.

154
00:08:07.957 --> 00:08:10.074
It was a good place to
go and become a par


155
00:08:10.159 --> 00:08:11.684
of something that moved me.

156
00:08:11.794 --> 00:08:14.787
ANNOUNCER: It's "The Black
Swan," starring Tyrone Power,


157
00:08:14.897 --> 00:08:17.833
in his lustiest role as
the daring Captain Waring.


158
00:08:17.900 --> 00:08:20.415
Of course I went to
movies all the time.


159
00:08:20.503 --> 00:08:22.688
I lived at the movies.

160
00:08:22.805 --> 00:08:24.421
There was an aura
about movie stars.


161
00:08:24.507 --> 00:08:26.271
It was quite wonderful.

162
00:08:26.342 --> 00:08:27.628
They were total escapism.

163
00:08:27.743 --> 00:08:30.372
I loved that.

164
00:08:30.446 --> 00:08:34.247
Movies was a world away.

165
00:08:34.316 --> 00:08:38.401
I did feel I was
different from other boys.


166
00:08:38.487 --> 00:08:43.016
The word gay was not
around when I was a kid.


167
00:08:43.125 --> 00:08:48.894
They used derogatory
terms- fairy, queer.


168
00:08:48.964 --> 00:08:51.991
And I might even have
said that about someone,


169
00:08:52.101 --> 00:08:54.400
not wanting to be
different, wanting


170
00:08:54.470 --> 00:08:57.065
to be like everyone else.

171
00:08:57.139 --> 00:08:59.233
I was always taught
if there's something


172
00:08:59.308 --> 00:09:02.938
bad just push it from your
mind, push it from your mind.


173
00:09:03.012 --> 00:09:05.675
So I never confronted those
things, even though it was


174
00:09:05.781 --> 00:09:07.363
there and was very powerful.

175
00:09:10.853 --> 00:09:13.516
I hated myself.

176
00:09:13.622 --> 00:09:15.409
I went to confession.

177
00:09:15.491 --> 00:09:17.949
And this one priest made me feel
like I was the most miserable


178
00:09:18.027 --> 00:09:18.881
person that ever lived.

179
00:09:21.864 --> 00:09:26.962
After my confession I fed
from the church completely,


180
00:09:27.036 --> 00:09:30.518
even though it was
something I really loved.


181
00:09:30.639 --> 00:09:34.326
I came away from that
more fearful than ever.


182
00:09:40.349 --> 00:09:45.788
I when John Burroughs Junior
High School with Arhur Gelien.


183
00:09:45.855 --> 00:09:50.543
It with as if magic had
dropped into the school.


184
00:09:50.659 --> 00:09:53.743
Honestly, the girls would
not leave him alone.


185
00:09:53.829 --> 00:09:56.822
They had never seen
anybody so handsome.


186
00:09:56.899 --> 00:09:59.414
They were just mesmerized.

187
00:09:59.535 --> 00:10:01.231
Girls were very
attracted to me,


188
00:10:01.337 --> 00:10:04.159
and it made me
exremely uncomforable


189
00:10:04.240 --> 00:10:09.008
when people would carry on
in any way, shape, or form.


190
00:10:09.078 --> 00:10:13.277
If he tried to walk down the
hall, he simply was mobbed.


191
00:10:13.382 --> 00:10:16.864
There were times that he'd have
to run into an empty classroom


192
00:10:16.952 --> 00:10:20.548
and lock the door to
get away from the girls.


193
00:10:20.623 --> 00:10:24.219
I don't know how he survived.

194
00:10:24.293 --> 00:10:28.219
The attention at school was
so disruptive that I just felt


195
00:10:28.297 --> 00:10:30.721
I needed some sor of escape.

196
00:10:30.800 --> 00:10:33.463
So I decided to join
the Coast Guard.


197
00:10:33.569 --> 00:10:34.582
I just had wanderlust.

198
00:10:38.407 --> 00:10:41.707
My mother and I had a big
argument just prior to my


199
00:10:41.777 --> 00:10:44.201
joining the Coast Guard.

200
00:10:44.280 --> 00:10:48.900
Kelm was my father's
name-- Charles Kelm.


201
00:10:48.984 --> 00:10:54.275
My earliest memory was my
father abusing my mother,


202
00:10:54.390 --> 00:10:57.872
and my brother and I crying.

203
00:10:57.960 --> 00:11:00.054
I had no recollection
of my father after that.


204
00:11:00.129 --> 00:11:01.825
My mother never wanted
to talk about him.


205
00:11:01.931 --> 00:11:03.547
In fact, you'd mention
his name and she


206
00:11:03.632 --> 00:11:04.429
would literally shudder.

207
00:11:07.269 --> 00:11:10.626
I at times wished
that we had a father.


208
00:11:10.739 --> 00:11:15.177
I kept saying Charlie probably
wasn't that bad after all.


209
00:11:15.244 --> 00:11:16.940
And my mother said, oh, really?

210
00:11:17.012 --> 00:11:19.129
Then I think you should go
to New York and see him.


211
00:11:22.017 --> 00:11:26.341
And when I was on libery in
New York, I had his address,


212
00:11:26.455 --> 00:11:28.219
and I knocked on the door.

213
00:11:28.290 --> 00:11:31.317
And this woman says, yes'?

214
00:11:31.427 --> 00:11:33.521
And I said, is
Charles Kelm here?


215
00:11:33.596 --> 00:11:35.895
And she said, no.

216
00:11:35.965 --> 00:11:41.586
And beyond her I could see
a fgure sitting in a chair.


217
00:11:41.670 --> 00:11:45.596
And I said to her, well, would
you tell him that his son


218
00:11:45.674 --> 00:11:48.189
came by to say hello?

219
00:11:48.310 --> 00:11:49.323
And she said, yes.

220
00:11:49.445 --> 00:11:50.777
And she slammed the
door in my face.


221
00:11:53.849 --> 00:11:57.650
I knew that that was my
father sitting in that chair.


222
00:11:57.720 --> 00:12:02.579
And I could tell that he
didn't want to see me.


223
00:12:02.691 --> 00:12:04.546
I was devastated.

224
00:12:04.660 --> 00:12:07.357
And I just walked in
the snow for hours.


225
00:12:10.299 --> 00:12:13.781
The Coast Guard found out I was
under age and discharged me.


226
00:12:13.869 --> 00:12:15.394
And then when they
discharged me,


227
00:12:15.504 --> 00:12:16.995
I went back down to Los Angeles.

228
00:12:22.378 --> 00:12:23.994
I worked as a delivery man.

229
00:12:24.079 --> 00:12:26.196
I worked wrapping presents
at Brothers


230
00:12:26.315 --> 00:12:27.078
in Hollywood.

231
00:12:27.149 --> 00:12:30.472
I worked at the Orange Julius
stand on Hollywood Boulevard.


232
00:12:30.552 --> 00:12:31.804
I did an awful lot of jobs.

233
00:12:36.091 --> 00:12:40.176
My brother was the one who
introduced me to horses.


234
00:12:40.262 --> 00:12:43.460
I wanted to do whatever
my brother did.


235
00:12:43.565 --> 00:12:45.830
And then my brother went on,
of course, to other things,


236
00:12:45.901 --> 00:12:48.598
but I stayed with the horses.

237
00:12:48.704 --> 00:12:53.301
I loved being around the horses
when they were in their stalls.


238
00:12:53.375 --> 00:12:54.354
I loved the smell of them.

239
00:12:54.443 --> 00:12:55.604
I loved working around them.

240
00:12:55.711 --> 00:12:57.566
I loved riding.

241
00:12:57.680 --> 00:13:02.482
And I got a job mucking
out and being at the barn.


242
00:13:02.551 --> 00:13:04.372
When the horse
came into my life,


243
00:13:04.453 --> 00:13:07.321
they totally consumed my life.

244
00:13:07.423 --> 00:13:10.120
One weekend at the
barn, Dick Clayton


245
00:13:10.225 --> 00:13:13.582
came out, who was an
actor at the time,


246
00:13:13.696 --> 00:13:16.325
with an actress by
the name of Ann Blyth.


247
00:13:16.398 --> 00:13:18.185
And they were doing
a photo layout


248
00:13:18.267 --> 00:13:20.418
for one of the movie magazines.

249
00:13:20.536 --> 00:13:25.133
Well, I was fascinated, so I
just stood there and watched.


250
00:13:25.207 --> 00:13:29.372
And then Ann left, and I got
to talking to Dick afterwards,


251
00:13:29.445 --> 00:13:31.869
and we became friendly.

252
00:13:31.947 --> 00:13:35.634
Dick never came on to me
like a lot of people did.


253
00:13:35.751 --> 00:13:39.233
I never felt a hidden
agenda from Dick Clayton


254
00:13:39.321 --> 00:13:43.850
because I just felt so
comforable with him.


255
00:13:43.959 --> 00:13:46.827
I never had a man in
my life like that.


256
00:13:46.929 --> 00:13:48.420
And he was the one
who frst planted


257
00:13:48.497 --> 00:13:52.093
the seed for me-- how would
you feel about being an actor'?


258
00:13:52.167 --> 00:13:56.298
And I thought, oh, wow,
that'd be terrifc.


259
00:13:56.405 --> 00:13:58.192
I did star thinking about it.

260
00:13:58.273 --> 00:14:00.208
But I didn't know what
to do, where to begin,


261
00:14:00.275 --> 00:14:01.732
how to get stared
in the business.


262
00:14:05.180 --> 00:14:10.198
Henry Wilson was an agent
for a lot of young actors.


263
00:14:10.319 --> 00:14:15.087
Henry had a stable of
stars- Guy Madison,


264
00:14:15.157 --> 00:14:19.117
Rory Calhoun, Rock Hudson.

265
00:14:19.194 --> 00:14:22.130
Henry Wilson was
a big-deal agent.


266
00:14:22.197 --> 00:14:27.818
And it seemed like every actor
he touched became a big star.


267
00:14:27.936 --> 00:14:30.724
And he had a cerain
style of client,


268
00:14:30.806 --> 00:14:33.230
and he was the one who
would take the pretty boys


269
00:14:33.308 --> 00:14:35.789
and make stars out of them.

270
00:14:35.878 --> 00:14:39.360
Dick Clayton said I want
you to me Henry Wilson.


271
00:14:39.481 --> 00:14:43.168
You know, he doesn't have
the most sterling reputation.


272
00:14:43.285 --> 00:14:44.947
And I went there and met him.

273
00:14:45.020 --> 00:14:47.319
You know, he was giving
you the look and the stare


274
00:14:47.389 --> 00:14:48.072
and all that.

275
00:14:48.190 --> 00:14:49.522
I'm not an idiot.

276
00:14:49.625 --> 00:14:52.322
I could see what
was going on there.


277
00:14:52.394 --> 00:14:56.229
Oh, yeah, Henry would put the
make on me every now and then.


278
00:14:56.331 --> 00:14:59.267
Occasionally his knee would push
against your knee or something


279
00:14:59.334 --> 00:15:00.996
like that.

280
00:15:01.070 --> 00:15:02.197
Well, I just wasn't interested.

281
00:15:02.304 --> 00:15:05.752
I mean, Henry was an amusing,
fun person to go out with once


282
00:15:05.841 --> 00:15:08.504
in a while, but that was it.

283
00:15:08.577 --> 00:15:09.909
Henry was cerainly not my type.

284
00:15:13.482 --> 00:15:15.906
We were sitting in
his offce, and he


285
00:15:15.984 --> 00:15:17.919
said the name's gotta go.

286
00:15:17.986 --> 00:15:19.773
So he said we've got
to tab you something.


287
00:15:19.855 --> 00:15:22.552
So that's how Tab came about.

288
00:15:22.658 --> 00:15:26.254
And I showed horses--
hunters and jumpers.


289
00:15:26.328 --> 00:15:27.785
And Henry said, that's
it-- Tab Hunter.


290
00:15:27.863 --> 00:15:29.718
That's a good name.

291
00:15:29.832 --> 00:15:35.271
I can just see my new name,
Tab Hunter, on the marquee.


292
00:15:35.337 --> 00:15:39.263
I remember having a few drinks,
and I was feeling no pain.


293
00:15:39.341 --> 00:15:44.598
I said, I'm going to be
a movie star. (LAUGHING)


294
00:15:44.680 --> 00:15:47.946
Ar Gelein became Tab Hunter.

295
00:15:48.016 --> 00:15:51.316
The new name was hard for
me to get used to though.


296
00:15:51.386 --> 00:15:53.503
And then Henry said, well, once
you see it on "pay to the order


297
00:15:53.589 --> 00:15:57.276
of," it won't be so bad.

298
00:15:57.392 --> 00:16:02.080
He was a man who was eager,
excited, and enthusiastic,


299
00:16:02.197 --> 00:16:03.779
and wanted it.

300
00:16:03.866 --> 00:16:05.562
Boy, it sure did come fast.

301
00:16:05.634 --> 00:16:07.569
ANNOUNCER: A lush,
topical paradise


302
00:16:07.636 --> 00:16:09.423
beyond your wildest
most romantic dreams.


303
00:16:12.407 --> 00:16:17.937
The frst interview I had was
for "Island of the Desire."


304
00:16:18.046 --> 00:16:20.470
So they sent me to
meet the director.


305
00:16:20.549 --> 00:16:24.907
He looked up and said,
that's the boy I want.


306
00:16:24.987 --> 00:16:26.273
And he asked me to
take off my shir.


307
00:16:26.388 --> 00:16:28.505
I was really embarrassed.

308
00:16:28.590 --> 00:16:31.674
I then did a screen
test with Linda Darnell.


309
00:16:31.760 --> 00:16:33.945
She was a very big name.

310
00:16:34.062 --> 00:16:37.692
Oh, I was a nervous wreck
doing a screen test.


311
00:16:37.766 --> 00:16:38.722
She said, don't worry.

312
00:16:38.800 --> 00:16:41.258
I'm good luck for newcomers.

313
00:16:41.336 --> 00:16:44.534
And they said, now you take her
in your arms and you kiss her.


314
00:16:44.640 --> 00:16:45.972
I took her in my arms
and I kissed her.


315
00:16:49.344 --> 00:16:51.279
(LAUGHING) I kissed her.

316
00:16:51.346 --> 00:16:52.029
She looked at me.

317
00:16:52.147 --> 00:16:53.843
And they said, cut,
and she pinched me,


318
00:16:53.949 --> 00:17:01.789
and she said, that was
nice. (LAUGHING) Audience


319
00:17:01.857 --> 00:17:03.678
response was phenomenal.

320
00:17:03.792 --> 00:17:06.614
Critics, ha, they hated.

321
00:17:06.695 --> 00:17:08.220
You're out of your mind!

322
00:17:08.330 --> 00:17:09.582
Darn right.

323
00:17:09.665 --> 00:17:11.691
This blasted
island's got me loco.


324
00:17:11.800 --> 00:17:13.052
I got roasted.

325
00:17:13.135 --> 00:17:14.148
Hello, Hawaii.

326
00:17:14.269 --> 00:17:15.521
Hello, America.

327
00:17:15.604 --> 00:17:16.583
Hello, England.

328
00:17:16.672 --> 00:17:17.958
Hello, anybody!

329
00:17:18.040 --> 00:17:21.124
He doesn't
demonstrate any shred


330
00:17:21.210 --> 00:17:22.997
of acting ability in that flm.

331
00:17:23.111 --> 00:17:25.569
I was born too late, and
I've got a lot to learn.


332
00:17:25.647 --> 00:17:28.401
My mother and I did go
to a screening of it.


333
00:17:28.483 --> 00:17:29.769
The lights came up.

334
00:17:29.851 --> 00:17:35.188
My mother said, you were lousy.

335
00:17:35.290 --> 00:17:40.274
I was so bad in the movie
that I couldn't get arrested.


336
00:17:40.362 --> 00:17:43.150
It was a long spell
between "Island


337
00:17:43.232 --> 00:17:46.168
of Desire" and my nex job.

338
00:17:46.235 --> 00:17:50.229
The only pars I could
get were grade-Z movies.


339
00:17:50.339 --> 00:17:51.500
Interpreting
hieroglyphics was par


340
00:17:51.573 --> 00:17:53.508
of my archaeological studies.

341
00:17:53.575 --> 00:17:59.276
I felt that I was a B actor
trapped in that genre of flm,


342
00:17:59.381 --> 00:18:02.704
and there was no way out.

343
00:18:02.818 --> 00:18:03.649
Hello, Pop!

344
00:18:03.719 --> 00:18:06.018
TAB HUNTER: Acting was
something that Dick Clayton


345
00:18:06.088 --> 00:18:08.751
was always on my case about.

346
00:18:08.857 --> 00:18:10.291
This isn't something
that just happens.


347
00:18:10.359 --> 00:18:12.988
You've got to work.

348
00:18:13.061 --> 00:18:18.193
There's so much to learn and so
much to tap inside of myself.


349
00:18:18.267 --> 00:18:21.465
And I wanted to go
on to the nex step.


350
00:18:21.570 --> 00:18:24.392
And he arranged for
me to do "Our Town."


351
00:18:24.506 --> 00:18:28.796
It was imporant for me to do
it because it was great material


352
00:18:28.877 --> 00:18:33.167
and a chance to grow.

353
00:18:33.248 --> 00:18:36.514
Marilyn Erskine, a Broadway
actress, who was very good,


354
00:18:36.585 --> 00:18:39.885
did not want to do
"Our Town" with me.


355
00:18:39.955 --> 00:18:44.609
George was a marvelous
par for a young actor.


356
00:18:44.726 --> 00:18:48.026
But Tab Hunter playing George?

357
00:18:48.096 --> 00:18:50.611
Well, I didn't see that.

358
00:18:50.732 --> 00:18:54.328
And so I was a little bit
concerned because that's such


359
00:18:54.403 --> 00:18:57.703
an imporant par of the play.

360
00:18:57.773 --> 00:18:59.890
We did a read through.

361
00:18:59.975 --> 00:19:01.762
And after we
fnished the reading


362
00:19:01.877 --> 00:19:04.631
she agreed to do it with me.

363
00:19:04.713 --> 00:19:08.730
She said, OK, young man, we've
got a lot of work ahead of us.


364
00:19:08.817 --> 00:19:10.752
Let's get to it.

365
00:19:10.819 --> 00:19:15.075
Well, I wanted him to be
comforable within himself


366
00:19:15.157 --> 00:19:17.945
that he can do this.

367
00:19:18.060 --> 00:19:22.509
Tad had that desire
to really be good.


368
00:19:22.597 --> 00:19:26.432
I saw an actor who
grew and grew, getting


369
00:19:26.501 --> 00:19:29.699
better and better and better.

370
00:19:29.805 --> 00:19:31.785
TAB HUNTER: The only thing
I really could rely on


371
00:19:31.907 --> 00:19:35.708
were my instincts
and my feelings.


372
00:19:35.777 --> 00:19:39.578
And they won't lead
you too far astray.


373
00:19:39.648 --> 00:19:42.345
And Tab was just fabulous.

374
00:19:42.451 --> 00:19:43.248
He was George.

375
00:19:45.954 --> 00:19:48.435
The play was exremely well
received, got good notices--


376
00:19:48.523 --> 00:19:52.119
the frst good notices I
ever received in my life.


377
00:19:52.194 --> 00:19:55.642
From that, it sor
of whet the appetite.


378
00:19:55.764 --> 00:19:58.552
I came away from that
experience realizing


379
00:19:58.633 --> 00:20:00.295
that I wanted to be an actor.

380
00:20:04.940 --> 00:20:08.422
The studios ran Hollywood.

381
00:20:08.510 --> 00:20:12.868
Hollywood was MGM,
Paramount, 20th Century


382
00:20:12.981 --> 00:20:16.816
Fox, Warner Brothers.

383
00:20:16.885 --> 00:20:22.074
It was just a society in
unto itself, Warner Brothers.


384
00:20:22.190 --> 00:20:25.706
It was the best studio,
so we were very proud.


385
00:20:25.827 --> 00:20:29.275
But you did not cross
to cross Jack Warner.


386
00:20:29.364 --> 00:20:32.664
Colonel Warner- Colonel Jack
Warner, ladies and gentlemen.


387
00:20:32.734 --> 00:20:34.316
You know, Warner was
quite a character.


388
00:20:34.403 --> 00:20:35.587
He really was.

389
00:20:35.704 --> 00:20:39.061
He looked like Lucifer with
a little mustache of his.


390
00:20:39.174 --> 00:20:40.995
Ha, you son-of-a-bitch.
(LAUGHING)


391
00:20:41.076 --> 00:20:44.069
When you had a guy like
Jack Warner on your side,


392
00:20:44.179 --> 00:20:45.613
you had the whole
Warner Brothers


393
00:20:45.680 --> 00:20:47.444
operation on your side.

394
00:20:47.516 --> 00:20:49.633
You were in business.

395
00:20:49.718 --> 00:20:51.243
The studio contract
was really good


396
00:20:51.353 --> 00:20:54.437
because of the security of it.

397
00:20:54.523 --> 00:20:57.459
At Warner Brothers,
they had acting classes,


398
00:20:57.526 --> 00:20:59.643
singing, dancing.

399
00:20:59.728 --> 00:21:03.415
And I said, Henry, I
really need to go to work.


400
00:21:03.532 --> 00:21:05.899
And Henry sent out wired
to different producers


401
00:21:06.001 --> 00:21:07.583
saying Tab Hunter's available.

402
00:21:07.669 --> 00:21:10.605
And he arranged for me to
meet, casting


403
00:21:10.672 --> 00:21:12.459
director of Warner Brothers.

404
00:21:12.541 --> 00:21:14.999
And I got a call
from the studio.


405
00:21:15.076 --> 00:21:16.840
They took out an
option that they


406
00:21:16.912 --> 00:21:19.097
might put me under contract.

407
00:21:19.214 --> 00:21:22.810
And your frst picture will
be with John Wayne in and Lana


408
00:21:22.884 --> 00:21:25.069
Turner in "The Sea Chase!"

409
00:21:25.187 --> 00:21:26.849
, more coffee.

410
00:21:26.922 --> 00:21:27.878
Yes, sir.

411
00:21:27.956 --> 00:21:30.551
All I had to say in
the flm was, yes, sir.


412
00:21:30.625 --> 00:21:31.308
Yes, sir.

413
00:21:31.426 --> 00:21:32.189
Thank you.

414
00:21:32.260 --> 00:21:33.785
Everybody, sir.

415
00:21:33.895 --> 00:21:35.352
"The Sea Change" was
an all right flm,


416
00:21:35.430 --> 00:21:36.921
but I had nothing to do in it.

417
00:21:37.032 --> 00:21:37.863
I was very disappointed.

418
00:21:40.936 --> 00:21:43.565
Jack Warner was looking
at rushes of the flm,


419
00:21:43.638 --> 00:21:45.755
and a director by the
name of William Wellman,


420
00:21:45.874 --> 00:21:49.356
"Wild Bill" Wellman, happened
to see a couple of my scenes


421
00:21:49.444 --> 00:21:53.097
and said, I want that
kid for my nex picture.


422
00:21:53.215 --> 00:21:54.911
And the nex picture
was "Track of the Cat"


423
00:21:54.983 --> 00:21:55.814
with Rober Mitchum.

424
00:21:55.917 --> 00:21:58.739
The place is just
crawling with dreams.


425
00:21:58.820 --> 00:22:01.005
Do you have any, kid'?

426
00:22:01.122 --> 00:22:03.216
I go along Mitch very well.

427
00:22:03.291 --> 00:22:05.920
He had great sense of
humor and was full of hell.


428
00:22:05.994 --> 00:22:08.589
I really like him a lot.

429
00:22:08.663 --> 00:22:11.747
Well, the frst big flm
I did at Warner Brothers


430
00:22:11.833 --> 00:22:15.315
was a flm called "Battle Cry."
"Battle Cry" was the biggest


431
00:22:15.437 --> 00:22:18.589
picture Warner's had that year.

432
00:22:18.673 --> 00:22:23.327
They tested me nine times for
the role of Danny Forrester.


433
00:22:23.445 --> 00:22:26.643
Sorry, I-- I felt
kind of itchy.


434
00:22:26.748 --> 00:22:29.081
I wasn't the only one
who tested for that role.


435
00:22:29.150 --> 00:22:30.072
Kiss me.

436
00:22:30.151 --> 00:22:30.834
Can't hear.

437
00:22:33.121 --> 00:22:37.411
Warner's tested Jimmy Dean
and Paul Newman for the role.


438
00:22:37.492 --> 00:22:39.950
They still couldn't
make up their mind.


439
00:22:40.028 --> 00:22:43.510
So they said, well, we'll
give this kid one more test.


440
00:22:43.632 --> 00:22:46.830
The morning I left
to go to the test


441
00:22:46.935 --> 00:22:48.221
my mother stopped
me at the door,


442
00:22:48.303 --> 00:22:49.555
and she said, think positive.

443
00:22:49.638 --> 00:22:52.426
See yourself in this role.

444
00:22:52.507 --> 00:22:56.160
And she said, if it's
meant to be, it will be.


445
00:22:56.278 --> 00:22:58.463
I thought I was so bad
in that test I went home


446
00:22:58.547 --> 00:23:00.664
and was ready to kill myself.

447
00:23:00.782 --> 00:23:03.115
And that was the test
that got me the role.


448
00:23:03.184 --> 00:23:05.642
Give me a cheeseburger
and a cup of coffee.


449
00:23:05.720 --> 00:23:08.201
And, uh, how about a
piece that apple pie too.


450
00:23:08.323 --> 00:23:09.939
I just liked the role.

451
00:23:10.025 --> 00:23:11.607
It reminded me of my brother.

452
00:23:11.693 --> 00:23:16.222
He was a very straightforward,
decent human being.


453
00:23:16.331 --> 00:23:19.199
Any guy in the world would be
lucky to have you for a wife.


454
00:23:19.301 --> 00:23:21.896
The flm was very successful.

455
00:23:21.970 --> 00:23:23.757
It was a major hit
for Warner Brothers.


456
00:23:23.838 --> 00:23:25.272
ANNOUNCER: "Battle
Cry," the Warner


457
00:23:25.340 --> 00:23:29.835
Brothers story of the Marines,
having its world premier.


458
00:23:29.911 --> 00:23:33.029
I stared getting so much
recognition for doing it


459
00:23:33.148 --> 00:23:35.606
that I was offered the
seven-year contract


460
00:23:35.684 --> 00:23:37.118
with Warner Brothers.

461
00:23:37.185 --> 00:23:38.676
I thought, whoa.

462
00:23:38.753 --> 00:23:40.688
Tab Hunter!

463
00:23:40.755 --> 00:23:44.237
And when that came on, it
was like you struck a match,


464
00:23:44.359 --> 00:23:45.520
and off it went.

465
00:23:45.594 --> 00:23:48.052
ANNOUNCER: Hollywood pays
tribute to bright, new stars


466
00:23:48.163 --> 00:23:48.960
of tomorrow.

467
00:23:49.030 --> 00:23:52.228
Awards go to blue-eyed
and blond Tab Hunter.


468
00:23:52.334 --> 00:23:57.136
They translated everhing
into box offce receipts.


469
00:23:57.205 --> 00:24:01.495
Jack Warner saw
box-offce gold in Tab.


470
00:24:01.576 --> 00:24:03.602
Once I was under
contract to them,


471
00:24:03.712 --> 00:24:06.045
all this publicity
came out on me,


472
00:24:06.114 --> 00:24:08.595
and the publicity
exceeded the product.


473
00:24:08.717 --> 00:24:10.982
ANNOUNCER: Actor Tab
Hunter signs autographs


474
00:24:11.052 --> 00:24:13.681
in the time-honored way.

475
00:24:13.755 --> 00:24:16.623
They were selling
the All-American boy.


476
00:24:16.725 --> 00:24:18.694
Take him home to mother.

477
00:24:18.760 --> 00:24:20.581
It was a nice wholesome image.

478
00:24:20.695 --> 00:24:21.879
How do you feel
about dancing tonight?


479
00:24:21.963 --> 00:24:22.646
Are you ready'?

480
00:24:22.764 --> 00:24:24.858
A little awkward,
but I guess I'm ready.


481
00:24:24.933 --> 00:24:27.926
He was everhere.

482
00:24:28.036 --> 00:24:30.460
We were being bombarded
with Tab's presence.


483
00:24:30.538 --> 00:24:35.670
And I was delighted because he
was so exciting to be watching.


484
00:24:35.744 --> 00:24:38.828
ANNOUNCER: America's
favorite sweethears,

Tab Hunter and Natalie Wood.

486
00:24:41.449 --> 00:24:42.781
Natalie Wood was the
sweetest little thing


487
00:24:42.884 --> 00:24:43.977
that ever came down the road.

488
00:24:44.052 --> 00:24:44.735
I loved her.

489
00:24:44.819 --> 00:24:45.980
She was like my kid sister.

490
00:24:46.087 --> 00:24:49.205
You really got it
made, haven't you?


491
00:24:49.290 --> 00:24:50.656
TAB HUNTER: She had
been a very successful


492
00:24:50.759 --> 00:24:52.944
in "Rebel Without a
Cause" with Jimmy Dean,


493
00:24:53.061 --> 00:24:57.351
and I had been successful
in "Battle Cry."


494
00:24:57.432 --> 00:24:59.196
Warner Brothers put us together.

495
00:24:59.267 --> 00:25:02.920
They wanted to make us
into the new "dream team."


496
00:25:03.004 --> 00:25:04.768
We went along with
it, of course.


497

ANNOUNCER: Tab
Hunter, Natalie Wood.


498
00:25:08.076 --> 00:25:09.362
And they had a
great time together.


499
00:25:09.444 --> 00:25:10.241
She adored him.

500
00:25:10.311 --> 00:25:13.668
I never met a gal
with such spunk.


501
00:25:13.782 --> 00:25:16.934
ROBERT WAGNER: He was on
fre, and she was on fre.


502
00:25:17.018 --> 00:25:18.111
They traveled a lot together.

503
00:25:18.186 --> 00:25:21.008
They went on tours together.

504
00:25:21.122 --> 00:25:22.613
TAB HUNTER: Oh, my gosh,
there were thousands


505
00:25:22.691 --> 00:25:23.488
and thousands of kids.

506
00:25:27.328 --> 00:25:29.183
He looked like he loved
being a movie star,


507
00:25:29.297 --> 00:25:30.549
and he was a good one.

508
00:25:30.632 --> 00:25:32.817
ANNOUNCER: Warner Brothers stars
Natalie Wood and tab Hunter


509
00:25:32.934 --> 00:25:36.860
plant a Christmas parade for the
annual Toys for Tots campaign.


510
00:25:36.938 --> 00:25:39.271
But I knew Tab
frst from his music.


511
00:25:42.210 --> 00:25:43.872
TAB HUNTER: The
recording career came


512
00:25:43.978 --> 00:25:48.177
about when Randy Wood
of Dot Records said,


513
00:25:48.283 --> 00:25:50.434
how would you like to record?

514
00:25:50.518 --> 00:25:53.841
I said, I'd love it.

515
00:25:53.955 --> 00:25:55.981
Randy had me come over there.

516
00:25:56.057 --> 00:25:58.879
I cut the record.

517
00:25:58.993 --> 00:26:01.588
Randy yelled out, that's it.

518
00:26:01.663 --> 00:26:03.120
It's gonna be a hit.

519
00:26:08.536 --> 00:26:11.017
(SINGING)--for every
boy and girl there's just


520
00:26:11.139 --> 00:26:14.769
one love in this
whole world, and I-hi


521
00:26:14.843 --> 00:26:19.702
kno-ho I-hi
-I found mine.

522
00:26:20.815 --> 00:26:22.932
It became the number
one song in the nation.


523
00:26:23.017 --> 00:26:23.939
(SINGING) Young love.

524
00:26:24.018 --> 00:26:24.940
Young love.

525
00:26:25.019 --> 00:26:25.941
First love.

526
00:26:26.020 --> 00:26:27.955
First love.

527
00:26:28.022 --> 00:26:30.958
When "Young Love" hit
number one on the pop chars,


528
00:26:31.025 --> 00:26:33.688
it knocked Elvis
out of number one


529
00:26:33.762 --> 00:26:36.732
and stays for a month
and a half at the top


530
00:26:36.831 --> 00:26:39.767
of the national chars.

531
00:26:39.834 --> 00:26:42.918
Jack Warner blew his stack.

532
00:26:43.004 --> 00:26:46.691
He said, we own
you for everhing.


533
00:26:46.775 --> 00:26:48.926
He had totally prohibited
me from recording


534
00:26:49.043 --> 00:26:51.194
for Dot any longer.

535
00:26:51.279 --> 00:26:54.602
And I said, but Mr. Warner, you
don't have a recording company.


536
00:26:54.716 --> 00:26:55.968
And he said, well, we do now.

537
00:26:56.050 --> 00:26:58.235
And, they stared Warner
Brothers Records for me.


538
00:26:58.353 --> 00:27:04.816
[MUSIC- TAB HUNTER, "NINETY NINE
WAYS"]


539
00:27:07.362 --> 00:27:11.493
Tab had a real genuine
reporing career.


540
00:27:11.566 --> 00:27:13.933
He was not a one-hit wonder.

541
00:27:14.035 --> 00:27:16.732
He released dozens of
singles and albums.


542
00:27:16.805 --> 00:27:20.799
It was phenomenal, and it
was noticed by everyone.


543
00:27:20.909 --> 00:27:27.702
(SINGING) What a wonderful
wedding there will be.


544
00:27:27.782 --> 00:27:35.144
What wonderful day
for you and me.


545
00:27:35.256 --> 00:27:38.192
He came along at a
very brilliant time.


546
00:27:38.259 --> 00:27:41.229
It was the beginning of the
teenage revolution in America.


547
00:27:44.165 --> 00:27:47.522
He had a million and one
crushes from the largest group


548
00:27:47.635 --> 00:27:50.423
of teenagers that has
ever lived in the United


549
00:27:50.505 --> 00:27:52.485
States, the baby boomers.

550
00:27:54.843 --> 00:27:58.644
They were the ones who would
make a career overnight,


551
00:27:58.746 --> 00:28:00.567
and they cerainly
did with mine.


552
00:28:00.648 --> 00:28:01.411
I can't help it.

553
00:28:01.482 --> 00:28:04.077
I've got a very bad
case of Tab Hunter-itis.


554
00:28:04.152 --> 00:28:06.417
I know just how you feel.

555
00:28:06.487 --> 00:28:09.002
I had Tab's
pictures on my wall.


556
00:28:09.123 --> 00:28:11.456
We all did.

557
00:28:11.526 --> 00:28:15.122
My wall was covered with
pictures of Tab Hunter.


558
00:28:15.196 --> 00:28:19.395
Young girls just
were crazy about him.


559
00:28:23.371 --> 00:28:27.365
The minute they took a
look he became their guy,


560
00:28:27.475 --> 00:28:30.468
and he was marketed
to those people.


561
00:28:30.545 --> 00:28:32.639
It was the movie
magazines that really


562
00:28:32.714 --> 00:28:37.163
made him a huge star, more than
the flms that he was making.


563
00:28:37.285 --> 00:28:39.652
TAB HUNTER: The kids
kept demanding all of it,


564
00:28:39.721 --> 00:28:43.522
so I would get things like "Tab
Hunter Buys a Hat," "Tab Hunter


565
00:28:43.625 --> 00:28:47.915
Drives a Car," "Tab
Hunter Cleans a Window,"


566
00:28:47.996 --> 00:28:52.616
"Tab Hunter Goes to the
Beach-J' wee! (LAUGHING)


567
00:28:52.700 --> 00:28:56.455
One of the magazines
had a contest,


568
00:28:56.537 --> 00:29:01.521
and I won a date in Hollywood
with Tab Hunter in 1956.


569
00:29:06.748 --> 00:29:08.000
Was I nervous?

570
00:29:08.082 --> 00:29:10.415
I could hardly breathe.

571
00:29:10.518 --> 00:29:15.445
When I frst saw Tab Hunter,
I was very intimidated.


572
00:29:15.523 --> 00:29:22.396
And he smiled, and that
smile was just truly magical.


573
00:29:22.497 --> 00:29:25.160
Tab Hunter was the
hearthrob that I had


574
00:29:25.233 --> 00:29:28.533
seen in the movie magazines.

575
00:29:28.603 --> 00:29:33.223
And we had dinner and dancing.

576
00:29:33.341 --> 00:29:35.856
I could not believe,
Jo-Ann, here you


577
00:29:35.944 --> 00:29:37.401
are dancing with Tab Hunter.

578
00:29:40.214 --> 00:29:45.198
My date was over, and
he gave me a kiss.


579
00:29:45.286 --> 00:29:48.108
I felt like
Cinderella, and I had


580
00:29:48.222 --> 00:29:50.919
a kiss from my Prince Charming.

581
00:29:51.025 --> 00:29:53.813
It was a dream-come-true.

582
00:29:53.895 --> 00:29:58.026
In the 1950s love and
marriage was the ideal theme.


583
00:29:58.099 --> 00:30:01.399
It's not always very real.

584
00:30:01.469 --> 00:30:05.270
The studios had a system.

585
00:30:05.373 --> 00:30:11.142
And they always wanted their
starlets to go out on a date


586
00:30:11.212 --> 00:30:13.807
with a beautiful, handsome boy.

587
00:30:13.881 --> 00:30:17.966
And the one they
chose was Tab Hunter.


588
00:30:18.052 --> 00:30:21.568
He was a guy that all the
girls wanted to go out with.


589
00:30:21.656 --> 00:30:23.420
Of course I wanted to meet
Tab Hunter because he was


590
00:30:23.491 --> 00:30:26.689
the big young male star
at Warner Brothers,


591
00:30:26.794 --> 00:30:30.219
and I was the big female
star at Columbia Pictures.


592
00:30:30.298 --> 00:30:33.382
And so we had to date.

593
00:30:33.468 --> 00:30:35.164
He was a gentleman.

594
00:30:35.269 --> 00:30:38.023
He always came around
and opened the doors.


595
00:30:38.106 --> 00:30:39.688
He picked up checks.

596
00:30:39.774 --> 00:30:42.107
And my parents liked him.

597
00:30:42.176 --> 00:30:42.859
It was fun.

598
00:30:42.977 --> 00:30:45.435
We did all sors of things.

599
00:30:45.513 --> 00:30:49.200
We did all the things that
normal people do on dates.


600
00:30:49.317 --> 00:30:53.607
But we had a third person who
was a photographer with us.


601
00:30:53.688 --> 00:30:58.183
He was the kind of boy every
mother would want to have


602
00:30:58.292 --> 00:31:00.921
married into her family.

603
00:31:00.995 --> 00:31:02.691
He had an honesty.

604
00:31:02.797 --> 00:31:05.096
He had a simplicity.

605
00:31:05.166 --> 00:31:08.853
He a cerain strength
of character.


606
00:31:08.970 --> 00:31:12.122
He would not let anybody down.

607
00:31:12.206 --> 00:31:16.075
We got along great because
he was always fun and sweet.


608
00:31:16.177 --> 00:31:21.434
And he wasn't after me,
so he wasn't on the make.


609
00:31:21.516 --> 00:31:24.304
And women like that.

610
00:31:24.385 --> 00:31:28.880
I really was a very naive,
young, innocent girl,


611
00:31:28.990 --> 00:31:33.075
and I would never think that the
most handsome boy would be gay.


612
00:31:35.730 --> 00:31:37.312
TAB HUNTER: I
would never discuss


613
00:31:37.398 --> 00:31:38.980
my private life with anyone.

614
00:31:41.903 --> 00:31:45.055
I was able to get close to
them, but I never really went


615
00:31:45.173 --> 00:31:46.789
that deep in the relationship.

616
00:31:49.977 --> 00:31:54.995
I had the ability to
live behind this wall.


617
00:31:57.919 --> 00:32:01.515
And you only allow people
to break the barrier


618
00:32:01.589 --> 00:32:03.114
if you feel you
can confde in them


619
00:32:03.224 --> 00:32:06.160
and you want to have
that friendship.


620
00:32:06.227 --> 00:32:09.095
INTERVlEWER: What was your frst
relationship with another guy?


621
00:32:09.197 --> 00:32:11.223
Pfoof.

622
00:32:11.332 --> 00:32:14.848
(LAUGHING) The frst
relationship I had


623
00:32:14.936 --> 00:32:19.374
was when I was ice skating
with a fellow skater.


624
00:32:19.440 --> 00:32:21.705
INTERVlEWER: Can you
tell me about that?


625
00:32:21.776 --> 00:32:23.267
What do you want to know'?

626
00:32:23.377 --> 00:32:32.174
(LAUGHING) I always
loved fgure skating.


627
00:32:32.287 --> 00:32:38.238
I competed in the regionals,
and I went to the nationals.


628
00:32:38.360 --> 00:32:42.650
I enjoyed just being on the ice.

629
00:32:42.731 --> 00:32:48.523
He was a very good skater and a
very strong competitor as well.


630
00:32:48.604 --> 00:32:52.120
A lot of his friends were
ice skaters- champion ice


631
00:32:52.241 --> 00:32:53.823
skaters with the Ice Capades.

632
00:32:53.909 --> 00:32:55.844
Mouseketeers, meet
Ronnie Roberson.


633
00:32:55.911 --> 00:32:56.674
Hi, Ronnie!

634
00:32:56.745 --> 00:32:57.428
Hi, Mouseketeers.

635
00:32:57.546 --> 00:33:00.812
Hi, Bob.

636
00:33:00.883 --> 00:33:04.843
Ronnie Roberson was known
as a great technician.


637
00:33:04.920 --> 00:33:09.608
His skating was different
than anybody else's skating.


638
00:33:09.725 --> 00:33:12.240
And he could spin faster
than anybody in the world.


639
00:33:12.327 --> 00:33:14.182
Nobody ever spun that well.

640
00:33:14.296 --> 00:33:15.787
He was a major talent.

641
00:33:18.600 --> 00:33:21.752
We had an attraction
for one another.


642
00:33:21.837 --> 00:33:26.275
And I drove him home one
evening after a skiing session.


643
00:33:26.341 --> 00:33:28.822
Nex thing, we were
in a relationship.


644
00:33:32.814 --> 00:33:34.476
I'm sure there was
talk about Ronnie


645
00:33:34.583 --> 00:33:38.213
and myself in the skating
world, paricularly


646
00:33:38.287 --> 00:33:40.552
if you've got a talent and
people are jealous of it.


647
00:33:43.492 --> 00:33:47.486
There were times when I was
cerainly stressed hearing


648
00:33:47.596 --> 00:33:50.191
things that had been said.

649
00:33:50.265 --> 00:33:57.866
But you learn when you're in the
public eye to comparmentalize.


650
00:33:57.940 --> 00:34:00.421
A big issue as
that Tab was around.


651
00:34:00.509 --> 00:34:04.708
And the political game at that
time is you don't do that.


652
00:34:04.813 --> 00:34:07.681
There was one skater
that didn't like the fact


653
00:34:07.783 --> 00:34:10.537
that Ronnie and I were
friends and took a skate blade


654
00:34:10.619 --> 00:34:11.712
to my new car and
just went right


655
00:34:11.787 --> 00:34:13.756
down the side, (SCRATCHING
SOUND) to the paint.


656
00:34:16.658 --> 00:34:21.426
Tab came to the championships
with Ronnie Roberson.


657
00:34:21.496 --> 00:34:23.283
Ronnie was told
that he would not


658
00:34:23.365 --> 00:34:28.349
win the championships unless
Tab would not come along.


659
00:34:28.470 --> 00:34:31.406
And Ronnie said,
it didn't matter.


660
00:34:31.473 --> 00:34:33.624
He wanted him there.

661
00:34:33.709 --> 00:34:36.861
And Ronnie skated- oh,
magnifcent performance.


662
00:34:42.517 --> 00:34:44.543
The fact that I was
there with Ronnie


663
00:34:44.653 --> 00:34:52.345
might have hur his ability to
win, and he should have won.


664
00:34:58.066 --> 00:35:03.016
My mother never really approved
of the Hollywood stuff.


665
00:35:03.105 --> 00:35:06.587
Being private was
very imporant to her.


666
00:35:06.708 --> 00:35:10.008
She only visited me on a set
twice in all of the years


667
00:35:10.078 --> 00:35:13.071
I was in the business.

668
00:35:13.181 --> 00:35:15.275
She did one interview
for a magazine,


669
00:35:15.350 --> 00:35:18.434
but it was like pulling
teeth to get her to do that.


670
00:35:18.520 --> 00:35:20.136
People would say,
oh, Mrs. Gelien,


671
00:35:20.222 --> 00:35:22.157
aren't you excited about Tab'?

672
00:35:22.224 --> 00:35:23.988
And my mother would
say, yes, it's nice,


673
00:35:24.059 --> 00:35:27.985
but Walter's the
intelligent one.


674
00:35:28.063 --> 00:35:31.420
My mother was always
a very intense woman.


675
00:35:31.533 --> 00:35:34.230
She had a lot of
pressure in her life.


676
00:35:34.303 --> 00:35:37.330
She was very high strung.

677
00:35:37.439 --> 00:35:38.600
While I was doing
"Battle Cry" I was


678
00:35:38.707 --> 00:35:42.132
in touch with my mother a lot.

679
00:35:42.210 --> 00:35:45.806
And I noticed a change
in her behavior.


680
00:35:45.881 --> 00:35:49.511
She would fy off the
handle rather quickly.


681
00:35:49.584 --> 00:35:51.917
She was ranting
on behind a closed


682
00:35:51.987 --> 00:35:54.855
door in the bathroom in German.

683
00:35:54.956 --> 00:36:01.226
And she ran out into the street
and collapsed in my arms.


684
00:36:01.296 --> 00:36:05.745
It just got more out of control
and more out of control.


685
00:36:05.834 --> 00:36:13.856
My mother totally lost it,
and I had to commit my mother


686
00:36:13.975 --> 00:36:14.738
to a mental institution.

687
00:36:18.980 --> 00:36:20.949
And it was very diffcult to do.

688
00:36:24.686 --> 00:36:27.053
And on the way there I
said, Mom, please try


689
00:36:27.155 --> 00:36:28.134
to understand what I'm saying.

690
00:36:28.256 --> 00:36:30.771
I really feel bad about this.

691
00:36:30.859 --> 00:36:33.010
And she said, I know.

692
00:36:33.128 --> 00:36:35.825
I know.

693
00:36:35.931 --> 00:36:38.924
I had to commit my mother.

694
00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:41.094
I mean, there was
nothing else that I


695
00:36:41.169 --> 00:36:44.139
could think should be done.

696
00:36:49.511 --> 00:36:54.199
She had to have 37
electroshock treatments.


697
00:36:54.316 --> 00:36:57.798
I went down there to
see her, of course.


698
00:36:57.886 --> 00:37:01.721
I remember walking in,
and she was lying in bed,


699
00:37:01.823 --> 00:37:05.305
and they shaved her head where
she had all the treatments.


700
00:37:05.394 --> 00:37:12.483
And as I walked in she said,
why did you do this to me'?


701
00:37:15.203 --> 00:37:19.971
She was very fragile when I went
to see her, but she was better.


702
00:37:20.041 --> 00:37:24.058
When I saw my mother,
as helpless as she was,


703
00:37:24.179 --> 00:37:25.795
I swore that she would
never have to work


704
00:37:25.881 --> 00:37:26.860
another day in her life.

705
00:37:29.718 --> 00:37:31.539
Hello, I'm Tab Hunter.

706
00:37:31.653 --> 00:37:33.315
Did you know that mental
illness claims more


707
00:37:33.388 --> 00:37:35.721
victims than any other disease?

708
00:37:35.824 --> 00:37:36.655
That's right.

709
00:37:36.725 --> 00:37:39.661
One American in every 10 is
suffering from some disabling


710
00:37:39.728 --> 00:37:40.855
mental or emotional disorder.

711
00:37:43.765 --> 00:37:49.750
In the 1950s being gay was
absolutely not acceptable.


712
00:37:49.871 --> 00:37:52.659
It was against the law.

713
00:37:52.741 --> 00:37:56.758
It was considered
a mental disease.


714
00:37:56.878 --> 00:38:01.373
There were very
devastating consequences.


715
00:38:01.450 --> 00:38:04.966
You couldn't have a
life being gay back


716
00:38:05.086 --> 00:38:11.572
in the '50s Tab would
be foolish not to hide,


717
00:38:11.693 --> 00:38:14.390
or he would not have a career.

718
00:38:14.463 --> 00:38:15.988
What do you think of your
dinner date here, Tab?


719
00:38:16.097 --> 00:38:17.258
She's very lovely, I must say.

720
00:38:17.365 --> 00:38:18.048
ANNOUNCER: Isn't She?

721
00:38:18.133 --> 00:38:18.816
Oh.

722
00:38:18.934 --> 00:38:21.904
The public saw me as one
person, and I was another.


723
00:38:21.970 --> 00:38:24.394
I didn't feel good about myself.

724
00:38:24.473 --> 00:38:28.672
Hollywood's most eligible
bachelor, Mr. Tab Hunter!


725
00:38:30.645 --> 00:38:34.161
TAB HUNTER: I never felt that
I deserve a lot of that stuff


726
00:38:34.282 --> 00:38:36.706
that was happening.

727
00:38:36.785 --> 00:38:39.869
You were rewarded for
pretending that you


728
00:38:39.955 --> 00:38:41.116
were someone you're not.

729
00:38:46.595 --> 00:38:52.933
Henry Wilson was a good agent,
but people outgrow one another.


730
00:38:53.001 --> 00:38:55.664
Then Dick Clayton
became an agent.


731
00:38:55.770 --> 00:38:59.457
I signed with him immediately
because I could trust him,


732
00:38:59.574 --> 00:39:00.405
and he was family.

733
00:39:03.078 --> 00:39:06.105
I told Henry I was leaving him.

734
00:39:06.181 --> 00:39:08.161
He was furious.

735
00:39:08.283 --> 00:39:11.765
Henry was very, very upset.

736
00:39:11.853 --> 00:39:13.344
In fact, because of
that, I'm sure it's


737
00:39:13.455 --> 00:39:17.051
why he turned over that story to
"Confdential" magazine on me.


738
00:39:19.961 --> 00:39:24.615
In the 1950s the magazine that
you had to be most concerned


739
00:39:24.699 --> 00:39:26.554
about was "Confdential."

740
00:39:26.668 --> 00:39:29.183
Oh, "Confdential" was
the talk of Hollywood


741
00:39:29.304 --> 00:39:30.738
because everyone was
afraid that if there


742
00:39:30.805 --> 00:39:32.831
was a skeleton in the
closet, it would be released.


743
00:39:32.941 --> 00:39:34.967
God knows I love you.

744
00:39:35.043 --> 00:39:37.194
But I won't let Ned
nor Kay or anyone else


745
00:39:37.312 --> 00:39:40.134
run our lives, Cary.

746
00:39:40.215 --> 00:39:43.333
"Confdential"
magazine, they had


747
00:39:43.451 --> 00:39:45.818
some information
on Rock that was


748
00:39:45.887 --> 00:39:48.368
very damaging to his career.

749
00:39:48.490 --> 00:39:51.460
And they were going to print it.

750
00:39:51.526 --> 00:39:56.453
Rock Hudson was the biggest
star that Henry Wilson ever had.


751
00:39:56.531 --> 00:39:59.888
He built Rock, and that
was his meal ticket.


752
00:40:00.001 --> 00:40:00.980
He was gonna protect that.

753
00:40:03.572 --> 00:40:06.838
To save Rock, Henry
gave "Confdential"


754
00:40:06.908 --> 00:40:10.333
the story about me when I'd
been arrested when I was just


755
00:40:10.412 --> 00:40:13.769
staring out in the business.

756
00:40:13.882 --> 00:40:15.862
Inside the magazine
the aricle read,


757
00:40:15.984 --> 00:40:21.446
"Tab Hunter caught at a
limp-wristed pajama pary."


758
00:40:21.523 --> 00:40:25.153
I would say I was
thrown under the bus.


759
00:40:25.226 --> 00:40:27.684
When the magazine
came out, I was


760
00:40:27.762 --> 00:40:30.220
sure that my career was over.

761
00:40:30.332 --> 00:40:32.961
I took Natalie to
the Academy Awards.


762
00:40:33.034 --> 00:40:34.286
That was about the
time-- a little


763
00:40:34.369 --> 00:40:36.736
after the "Confdential"
had come out.


764
00:40:36.838 --> 00:40:39.865
The press of the world was
there photographing us.


765
00:40:39.941 --> 00:40:43.810
And one guy yelled out,
smile pretty this way, Tab.


766
00:40:43.912 --> 00:40:48.361
This is for the nex issue
of "Confdential" magazine.


767
00:40:48.450 --> 00:40:50.385
Jack Warner, god
bless him, he turned


768
00:40:50.452 --> 00:40:54.139
me right back to the cameras
and said, just remember this.


769
00:40:54.255 --> 00:40:57.703
Today's headlines,
tomorrow's toilet paper.


770
00:40:57.792 --> 00:40:58.771
Everybody was nervous.

771
00:40:58.893 --> 00:41:02.409
But in those days they
could cover those things up.


772
00:41:02.530 --> 00:41:06.160
So if you are a money
maker for a studio,


773
00:41:06.234 --> 00:41:08.658
they are going to
protect that image


774
00:41:08.737 --> 00:41:12.003
like there is no tomorrow.

775
00:41:12.073 --> 00:41:17.000
The press knew just
about everhing,


776
00:41:17.078 --> 00:41:19.775
and they kept it to themselves
when it was to their advantage


777
00:41:19.881 --> 00:41:22.817
and to the advantage
of the studios.


778
00:41:22.884 --> 00:41:28.505
It was a gentleman's agreement--
just keep it out of the press


779
00:41:28.590 --> 00:41:31.071
and don't make waves.

780
00:41:31.159 --> 00:41:32.946
Jack Warner and
I never discussed


781
00:41:33.061 --> 00:41:36.691
my sexuality whatsoever.

782
00:41:36.765 --> 00:41:39.735
I was making a lot
of money for them.


783
00:41:39.801 --> 00:41:43.454
As long as I didn't destroy this
image that they were creating,


784
00:41:43.571 --> 00:41:45.096
that was imporant to them.

785
00:41:47.742 --> 00:41:50.940
They created this persona.

786
00:41:51.012 --> 00:41:54.813
That was your job
to be that persona.


787
00:41:54.916 --> 00:41:57.283
You played the
game, so to speak,


788
00:41:57.352 --> 00:41:59.833
if that's what they want.

789
00:41:59.954 --> 00:42:02.742
I did sign a contract,
and I was willing to do


790
00:42:02.824 --> 00:42:06.989
whatever they wanted me to
do to fulfll that contract.


791
00:42:07.095 --> 00:42:09.075
Don't you ever
think about marriage?


792
00:42:09.164 --> 00:42:10.985
All the time, Ernie.

793
00:42:11.099 --> 00:42:12.761
That's what keeps me single.

794
00:42:14.169 --> 00:42:16.650
I thought of marriage
a number of times


795
00:42:16.771 --> 00:42:20.606
because it's expected of you.

796
00:42:20.675 --> 00:42:23.099
When I did the flm
"Lafayette Escadrille,"


797
00:42:23.178 --> 00:42:25.875
that's when I frst
met Etchika Choureau.


798
00:42:25.980 --> 00:42:27.437
She stopped me
dead in my tracks.


799
00:42:27.515 --> 00:42:30.667
She was gorgeous.

800
00:42:30.785 --> 00:42:32.765
And we hit it off immediately.

801
00:42:32.854 --> 00:42:34.618
She didn't speak
a word of English.


802
00:42:34.689 --> 00:42:37.375
My French was just awful.

803
00:42:37.392 --> 00:42:39.213
I can't remember
what we talked about because


804
00:42:39.327 --> 00:42:41.023
he did not speak one word of French

805
00:42:41.129 --> 00:42:42.984
and I only spoke three words of English.

806
00:42:44.065 --> 00:42:47.388
I don't know how we communicated...
undoubtedly with our eyes.


807
00:42:48.703 --> 00:42:52.060
But in any case,
we got on like a house on fre.


808
00:42:53.341 --> 00:42:55.310
And he was irresistible.

809
00:42:56.377 --> 00:42:59.734
I usually can think of
a lot of things to say.


810
00:42:59.848 --> 00:43:03.444
Suddenly I can't say anything.

811
00:43:03.518 --> 00:43:05.976
We had wonderful
times together,


812
00:43:06.054 --> 00:43:09.252
and I was drawn closer
and closer to her.


813
00:43:09.824 --> 00:43:14.023
Yes, I had heard
that Tab was homosexual.


814
00:43:15.663 --> 00:43:23.025
I think it was a soul-searching
period of time about his sexuality.


815
00:43:24.272 --> 00:43:26.901
It must have been very painful for him.

816
00:43:27.709 --> 00:43:34.707
You know, actors often...always...
have two faces.


817
00:43:38.086 --> 00:43:41.534
I did feel discomfor, and I
did feel a little bit of guilt


818
00:43:41.623 --> 00:43:43.080
also.

819
00:43:43.191 --> 00:43:46.013
But I did seriously think
of marrying Etchika.


820
00:43:48.129 --> 00:43:50.610
I was fattered
to have been chosen, of course.


821
00:43:51.699 --> 00:43:53.486
If I was to marry Tab,

822
00:43:53.568 --> 00:43:54.752
it would have been for love.

823
00:43:55.436 --> 00:43:57.098
I would inevitably have never

824
00:43:57.205 --> 00:43:59.299
accepted to share
him with someone else.


825
00:44:00.875 --> 00:44:03.060
And I cerainly
would not have married him


826
00:44:03.144 --> 00:44:06.137
to protect him
and hide his homosexuality.


827
00:44:08.049 --> 00:44:10.348
I think Tab was
too good of a man.

828
00:44:11.753 --> 00:44:14.052
He would have never accepted
such a thing.


829
00:44:15.490 --> 00:44:19.450
It would have been a lovely story
if it could have been rewritten.


830
00:44:22.630 --> 00:44:25.145
She went back to Paris.

831
00:44:25.266 --> 00:44:28.259
I just couldn't commit to her.

832
00:44:28.336 --> 00:44:32.990
It wouldn't have been
right to be with Etchika.


833
00:44:33.107 --> 00:44:37.761
I felt that if you were with
a man, you were sinning.


834
00:44:37.846 --> 00:44:40.930
And if you were with a
woman, you'd be lying.


835
00:44:47.589 --> 00:44:52.539
Tony and I met at the pool
of the Chateau Marmont.


836
00:44:52.627 --> 00:44:56.712
He was in California doing
"Friendly Persuasion."


837
00:44:56.798 --> 00:44:58.778
I don't want to die.

838
00:44:58.867 --> 00:45:02.019
I don't know if I could
kill anyone if I tried.


839
00:45:02.136 --> 00:45:03.263
He was a good actor.

840
00:45:03.338 --> 00:45:05.102
ANNOUNCER: What is there
about Tony Perkins that


841
00:45:05.173 --> 00:45:07.199
made the young people
of America acclaim him


842
00:45:07.308 --> 00:45:09.573
as their star of the future?

843
00:45:09.644 --> 00:45:11.761
I'd been in the
business longer,


844
00:45:11.846 --> 00:45:15.931
but I respected the fact that
he'd done Broadway plays.


845
00:45:16.017 --> 00:45:18.680
I thought he was
very intelligent,


846
00:45:18.786 --> 00:45:21.779
and he was just fun to be with.

847
00:45:21.856 --> 00:45:23.950
We just kind of hit it off.

848
00:45:24.025 --> 00:45:25.459
[MUSIC- ANTHONY PERKINS,
"MOONLIGHT SWIM"]


849
00:45:29.364 --> 00:45:32.448
And I went up to
his room with him.


850
00:45:32.533 --> 00:45:37.392
That's when Tony and I got
together for the frst time.


851
00:45:37.505 --> 00:45:40.623
And that's when we
stared seeing each other.


852
00:45:40.708 --> 00:45:43.337
When I frst saw Tab
and Tony I knew that they


853
00:45:43.411 --> 00:45:45.710
were more than friends.

854
00:45:45.813 --> 00:45:47.247
It was pretty obvious.

855
00:45:50.151 --> 00:45:53.178
I had a wonderful
relationship with him.


856
00:45:53.254 --> 00:45:55.371
I did trust him.

857
00:45:55.490 --> 00:45:58.312
I was comforable with him.

858
00:45:58.393 --> 00:46:01.261
Tony and Tab were
totally different.


859
00:46:01.362 --> 00:46:02.523
Tony was East Coast.

860
00:46:02.597 --> 00:46:05.260
Tab was West Coast.

861
00:46:05.366 --> 00:46:08.666
Tab was very macho.

862
00:46:08.736 --> 00:46:13.424
Tony was very
sensitive, introvered.


863
00:46:13.541 --> 00:46:15.999
Well, I would see
him quite a lot.


864
00:46:16.077 --> 00:46:19.343
And he would stay to my place,
lived there for a while,


865
00:46:19.414 --> 00:46:21.929
got an aparment
around the corner.


866
00:46:22.050 --> 00:46:23.143
And then I would go back East.

867
00:46:23.217 --> 00:46:26.039
I'd say with Tony at his place.

868
00:46:26.120 --> 00:46:28.544
I knew that he was
very dedicated to being


869
00:46:28.623 --> 00:46:30.148
an actor in Hollywood.

870
00:46:30.258 --> 00:46:32.238
And the most promising
male star of tomorrow


871
00:46:32.360 --> 00:46:36.798
is the fne young
actor, Tony Perkins.


872
00:46:36.864 --> 00:46:39.800
TAB HUNTER: Tony was very
concerned about his image


873
00:46:39.867 --> 00:46:41.961
and doing the right thing.

874
00:46:42.036 --> 00:46:45.962
They would go to a lot of
pains not to be seen together.


875
00:46:46.040 --> 00:46:48.225
TAB HUNTER: At frst, when
Tony and I used to go out,


876
00:46:48.309 --> 00:46:50.289
we would go out together.

877
00:46:50.411 --> 00:46:52.198
But he would get recognized.

878
00:46:52.280 --> 00:46:54.215
I would get recognized.

879
00:46:54.282 --> 00:46:55.443
He felt very uncomforable.

880
00:46:55.550 --> 00:46:58.975
I always did too because
the idea of two young actors


881
00:46:59.053 --> 00:47:01.568
around together might
star some talk.


882
00:47:01.656 --> 00:47:02.635
(SINGING) Yes, I'm in love.

883
00:47:05.493 --> 00:47:07.519
Don't tell a soul.

884
00:47:07.628 --> 00:47:08.641
TAB HUNTER (SPEAKING):
Natalie Wood


885
00:47:08.763 --> 00:47:09.924
and I would go to a premiere.

886
00:47:09.998 --> 00:47:11.125
Then we'd go to
Ciro's afterwards.


887
00:47:11.232 --> 00:47:13.565
We'd be photographed dancing.

888
00:47:13.634 --> 00:47:15.933
Then we would leave, and
she'd go out the back door.


889
00:47:16.004 --> 00:47:18.269
She'd have a date
with Dennis Hopper.


890
00:47:18.339 --> 00:47:19.625
And I'd go see Tony.

891
00:47:19.741 --> 00:47:24.338
(SINGING) Shh, don't
let it get around.


892
00:47:24.412 --> 00:47:29.339
(SPEAKING) Tony and I did
go on couple dates together:


893
00:47:29.417 --> 00:47:32.239
Tab and Tony and I
went out together.


894
00:47:32.320 --> 00:47:34.915
I suppose I was a beard.

895
00:47:34.989 --> 00:47:37.083
But I was happy to
be a beard because we


896
00:47:37.158 --> 00:47:40.458
were having a good / I knew the
game, and we were playing it.


897
00:47:43.331 --> 00:47:47.086
In the fan magazines there would
being a picture of Tab and I.


898
00:47:47.168 --> 00:47:49.501
And then in the nex page
there'd be a picture of Tony


899
00:47:49.604 --> 00:47:53.257
and I doing something else,
but never just Tab and Tony.


900
00:47:53.341 --> 00:47:55.321
(SINGING) Shh, don't
let it get around.


901
00:48:06.387 --> 00:48:10.074
I did feel that Tab and
Tony had a real relationship.


902
00:48:10.191 --> 00:48:12.672
I could see them together:

903
00:48:12.794 --> 00:48:14.820
But it was a painful
relationship,


904
00:48:14.896 --> 00:48:15.818
at least for Tony.

905
00:48:19.901 --> 00:48:24.350
Tony was more in love with
Tab than Tab was with him.


906
00:48:24.472 --> 00:48:27.408
Whenever Tab and Tony
got into a fght,


907
00:48:27.475 --> 00:48:30.627
Tony would come to
my house and cry


908
00:48:30.711 --> 00:48:34.136
on my shoulder about
how mean Tab was.


909
00:48:34.215 --> 00:48:38.209
My relationship with Tony, I
never discussed with anyone.


910
00:48:38.319 --> 00:48:40.470
And if one of my so-called
friends or my friends


911
00:48:40.555 --> 00:48:44.913
would mention it, I probably
would have gone berserk.


912
00:48:45.026 --> 00:48:46.608
I would have hated
it and denied it


913
00:48:46.694 --> 00:48:49.061
emphatically--
(EXPLOSION SOUND) where I


914
00:48:49.163 --> 00:48:51.189
could blow it up very quickly.

915
00:48:51.265 --> 00:48:53.291
Tony, as the audience
ovation indicates,


916
00:48:53.401 --> 00:48:55.768
your career is cerainly
going full steam ahead.


917
00:48:55.870 --> 00:48:59.671
Tony was on his way to
being a pretty big star.


918
00:48:59.740 --> 00:49:04.189
Tony's career was most imporant
to him, more than anything.


919
00:49:04.278 --> 00:49:06.213
He could be exremely charming.

920
00:49:06.280 --> 00:49:08.613
But I think he had a
hidden agenda, as far


921
00:49:08.716 --> 00:49:12.016
as his career was concerned.

922
00:49:12.086 --> 00:49:17.855
You never really
knew Tony 100%.


923
00:49:17.925 --> 00:49:20.713
There was always
a secretive side,


924
00:49:20.795 --> 00:49:24.994
and he was a bit of a game
player with people's minds.


925
00:49:25.099 --> 00:49:26.055
Can't you see it's a brush-of

926
00:49:26.134 --> 00:49:27.261
They're trying me
out at a position.


927
00:49:27.368 --> 00:49:28.654
They know I can't play it!

928
00:49:28.736 --> 00:49:30.591
Just as soon as I make a few
errors, they're gonna drop me!


929
00:49:30.705 --> 00:49:33.334
Can't you see it?

930
00:49:33.407 --> 00:49:35.706
TAB HUNTER: The frst
live television show


931
00:49:35.776 --> 00:49:39.133
I did was "Fear Strikes Out."

932
00:49:39.247 --> 00:49:41.762
I played Jimmy Piersall.

933
00:49:41.883 --> 00:49:46.241
He was a ball player
who had mental problems.


934
00:49:46.320 --> 00:49:51.122
Tony caught my performance and
told me how much he liked it.


935
00:49:51.225 --> 00:49:52.989
I confded in Tony
that I wanted Warner


936
00:49:53.060 --> 00:49:56.713
Brothers to buy the project for
me to make a movie out of it.


937
00:49:56.797 --> 00:49:59.312
One evening we were playing
ping pong on a terrace,


938
00:49:59.433 --> 00:50:02.915
and he said, oh, by the
way, Paramount just bought


939
00:50:03.004 --> 00:50:05.633
"Fear Strikes Out" for me.

940
00:50:05.740 --> 00:50:07.709
And it just was like, whoa.

941
00:50:10.444 --> 00:50:12.060
He had mentioned
it to the studio,


942
00:50:12.146 --> 00:50:14.001
and they got it for him.

943
00:50:16.784 --> 00:50:19.777
He was a very ambitious young
man and a very fne actor


944
00:50:19.854 --> 00:50:22.005
and he should be working.

945
00:50:22.123 --> 00:50:29.041
But I did feel
betrayed by that move.


946
00:50:29.130 --> 00:50:32.396
When, Jimmy-- when that's
all you ever cared about.


947
00:50:32.466 --> 00:50:33.297
And you're killing me.

948
00:50:33.367 --> 00:50:34.653
You've been killing
me for years.


949
00:50:34.769 --> 00:50:35.930
Yes, you have.
And it's too much.


950
00:50:39.040 --> 00:50:41.635
He was very good in the flm.

951
00:50:41.709 --> 00:50:44.497
But our relationship
was strained after that.


952
00:50:47.882 --> 00:50:50.875
He told me that
his studio didn't


953
00:50:50.985 --> 00:50:55.150
want him to see me anymore.

954
00:50:55.223 --> 00:50:57.886
We saw less and
less of each other,


955
00:50:57.992 --> 00:51:00.655
and we just sor of grew apar.

956
00:51:05.800 --> 00:51:10.454
"Damn Yankees" was
a huge Broadway hit.


957
00:51:10.538 --> 00:51:13.895
Jack Warner bought
"Damn Yankees" for me.


958
00:51:14.008 --> 00:51:16.830
It was the frst really
good project for me


959
00:51:16.911 --> 00:51:19.210
from Warner Brothers.

960
00:51:19.313 --> 00:51:22.340
Jack Warner brought in
the whole New York cast,


961
00:51:22.416 --> 00:51:26.376
except for the lead, and
he wanted me to do that.


962
00:51:26.487 --> 00:51:28.968
I was the only outsider in it.

963
00:51:29.056 --> 00:51:31.924
It needed some
sparkle, which he had.


964
00:51:32.026 --> 00:51:33.961
What's the story on this kid'?

965
00:51:34.028 --> 00:51:38.887
This Tab Hunter was
like a breath of spring.


966
00:51:39.000 --> 00:51:40.491
WOW!

967
00:51:40.568 --> 00:51:42.901
The director was George Abbott.

968
00:51:43.004 --> 00:51:45.462
He didn't want me at all.

969
00:51:45.539 --> 00:51:47.508
He wanted Don Murray.

970
00:51:47.575 --> 00:51:50.898
Warner said, I want you
to the use Tab Hunter.


971
00:51:51.012 --> 00:51:53.607
He's the biggest
star at my studio.


972
00:51:53.681 --> 00:51:56.378
Every one of his
pictures is popular.


973
00:51:56.450 --> 00:51:58.567
Tab was cerainly at
the top of his game.


974
00:52:01.589 --> 00:52:04.616
George Abbott and
I did not get along.


975
00:52:04.725 --> 00:52:06.546
The frst time I met him
was at the read through.


976
00:52:06.627 --> 00:52:09.256
The whole New York
cast was sitting there.


977
00:52:09.363 --> 00:52:11.389
And after I read a
few lines, he said,


978
00:52:11.465 --> 00:52:13.400
I want you to read it like this.

979
00:52:13.467 --> 00:52:16.403
And he gave me a line reading,
which actors do not like.


980
00:52:16.470 --> 00:52:18.951
I want to exercise the escape
clause which is to take place


981
00:52:19.073 --> 00:52:21.861
on the 24th, which is today.

982
00:52:21.942 --> 00:52:25.424
So I read it the
way he wanted me to.


983
00:52:25.546 --> 00:52:27.242
We went on, and he
stopped me about two


984
00:52:27.315 --> 00:52:29.284
or three or four times.

985
00:52:29.383 --> 00:52:32.501
And fnally, I just
had had enough.


986
00:52:32.586 --> 00:52:34.919
So I stopped, and I said, Mr.
Abbott, from what I gather,


987
00:52:34.989 --> 00:52:36.173
you'd like me to do
it the way Stephen


988
00:52:36.290 --> 00:52:38.054
Douglas did it on Broadway.

989
00:52:38.125 --> 00:52:38.808
He said, yes, yes.

990
00:52:38.926 --> 00:52:39.905
That's exactly
what I would like.


991
00:52:39.994 --> 00:52:42.111
I said, well, I
thought Stephen Douglas


992
00:52:42.229 --> 00:52:48.021
had a magnifcent voice, but
I thought he was a real stick.


993
00:52:48.102 --> 00:52:50.071
If I play the
character, frst of all,


994
00:52:50.137 --> 00:52:52.436
he's got to be human being.

995
00:52:52.506 --> 00:52:54.486
That was the wrong
thing to tell him.


996
00:52:54.608 --> 00:52:56.975
Oh, I'm honest, but,
uh, I'm dumb too.


997
00:52:57.078 --> 00:53:00.526
He closed his script, said,
thank you all very much.


998
00:53:00.614 --> 00:53:04.483
He got up and left the room,
and I was fred off the picture.


999
00:53:04.585 --> 00:53:06.736
Jack Warner went
to Abbott and said,


1000
00:53:06.821 --> 00:53:07.914
I bought it for Tab Hunter.

1001
00:53:07.988 --> 00:53:09.513
Tab Hunter's going to do it.

1002
00:53:09.623 --> 00:53:12.104
You don't say no to Jack Warner.

1003
00:53:12.193 --> 00:53:13.047
OK, you win.

1004
00:53:13.160 --> 00:53:14.446
Get a uniform.
- You mean it?


1005
00:53:14.528 --> 00:53:15.484
- I mean it.
- Wow!


1006
00:53:15.596 --> 00:53:16.279
I made it!

1007
00:53:16.364 --> 00:53:17.218
(mum-nus)

1008
00:53:17.331 --> 00:53:19.095
Sol did the flm,
but it was diffcult,


1009
00:53:19.166 --> 00:53:22.159
knowing that he'd never wanted
me right from the star.


1010
00:53:22.269 --> 00:53:30.200
(SINGING) Whatever
Lola wants, Lola gets.


1011
00:53:30.277 --> 00:53:34.271
And Gwen Verdon- Gwen
always called me like a New


1012
00:53:34.348 --> 00:53:36.169
York cab driver-
- Tab Huntah.

1013
00:53:36.283 --> 00:53:38.104
(LAUGHING) I loved it.

1014
00:53:40.688 --> 00:53:43.385
The choreographer
was Bobby Fosse.


1015
00:53:43.491 --> 00:53:46.427
You can't get any
better than that.


1016
00:53:46.494 --> 00:53:48.588
Bobby Fosse made me
look like I could dance,


1017
00:53:48.662 --> 00:53:49.755
even though I have
two left feet.


1018
00:53:49.830 --> 00:53:51.799
And he said, don't
worry about it, Tab.


1019
00:53:51.866 --> 00:53:52.697
You'll be fne.

1020
00:53:52.800 --> 00:53:54.291
You see, Mr., uh, Mr.--

1021
00:53:54.368 --> 00:53:57.122
Uh, Hardy- uh, Joe Hardy.

1022
00:53:57.204 --> 00:54:01.494
I just felt like I wanted
to take him in my arms.


1023
00:54:01.575 --> 00:54:04.773
Well, he was perfect
for the role.


1024
00:54:04.879 --> 00:54:06.700
He was delicious
in it, and I think


1025
00:54:06.814 --> 00:54:09.898
that Mr. Abbott was very very
satisfed with him ultimately.


1026
00:54:09.984 --> 00:54:11.316
All right, a caron
of Winstons, and Tab,


1027
00:54:11.385 --> 00:54:12.671
thanks a million.
- Thank you very much.


1028
00:54:14.655 --> 00:54:18.285
He was always, always
trying to be better.


1029
00:54:20.928 --> 00:54:23.409
Probably at that time his
looks got in the way a bit.


1030
00:54:23.531 --> 00:54:26.786
I've had a great
evening. really I have.


1031
00:54:26.901 --> 00:54:28.563
I'll never forget it.

1032
00:54:28.669 --> 00:54:31.457
The era that Tab
got kind of stuck in


1033
00:54:31.539 --> 00:54:34.964
was that era when we were all
very attracted to the Brando


1034
00:54:35.042 --> 00:54:37.671
angst and the Jimmy Dean angst.

1035
00:54:37.745 --> 00:54:41.432
You're tearing me apar!

1036
00:54:41.549 --> 00:54:44.906
TAB HUNTER: Warner Brothers
had Jimmy as the rebel,


1037
00:54:45.019 --> 00:54:46.840
and they had me as
the all-American boy.


1038
00:54:46.921 --> 00:54:50.221
So they had their bases covered.

1039
00:54:50.291 --> 00:54:52.715
They did discuss me for the
Jimmy Dean role in "Rebel


1040
00:54:52.793 --> 00:54:56.480
Without a Cause."

1041
00:54:56.597 --> 00:54:59.226
Can you imagine that? (LAUGHING)

1042
00:54:59.300 --> 00:55:01.929
He didn't get the opporunities
with some of those pars


1043
00:55:02.036 --> 00:55:03.800
that he could've done very well.

1044
00:55:03.871 --> 00:55:07.296
And they were terribly
complicated people.


1045
00:55:07.374 --> 00:55:08.808
And one of the great
assets of Tab Hunter


1046
00:55:08.876 --> 00:55:10.538
was the fact that he
didn't look like a terribly


1047
00:55:10.611 --> 00:55:12.637
complicated person.

1048
00:55:12.746 --> 00:55:15.898
You know, it's a curse
and it's a blessing


1049
00:55:15.983 --> 00:55:20.148
to have that kind of career
where they think that you are


1050
00:55:20.254 --> 00:55:23.702
that infectious smile or
you are that person that


1051
00:55:23.791 --> 00:55:26.761
jumps off the screen to them.

1052
00:55:26.827 --> 00:55:30.252
Tab had a very
diffcult time trying


1053
00:55:30.331 --> 00:55:36.316
to prove that behind this
face there really is a talent.


1054
00:55:36.437 --> 00:55:41.808
ANNOUNCER: Playhouse 90,
tonight starring Tab Hunter.


1055
00:55:41.909 --> 00:55:44.060
TAB HUNTER: The director
Arhur Penn said, there's


1056
00:55:44.144 --> 00:55:45.965
a great script I've just read.

1057
00:55:46.080 --> 00:55:48.709
It was called "Porrait
of a Murderer."


1058
00:55:48.782 --> 00:55:50.364
He said, will you do it?

1059
00:55:50.451 --> 00:55:52.909
I said, oh, I don't think so.

1060
00:55:52.987 --> 00:55:55.252
Live television?

1061
00:55:55.322 --> 00:55:58.440
That would clear
the hell out of me.


1062
00:55:58.526 --> 00:56:01.155
I was awfully guilty of
saying, I can't do that,


1063
00:56:01.262 --> 00:56:03.379
or I'm afraid to do this.

1064
00:56:03.464 --> 00:56:04.625
But you've just got
to go (SPLASHING


1065
00:56:04.698 --> 00:56:06.485
SOUND) take the plunge.

1066
00:56:06.600 --> 00:56:09.263
ANNOUNCER: "Porrait
of a Murderer,"


1067
00:56:09.336 --> 00:56:11.453
directed by Arhur Penn.

1068
00:56:11.539 --> 00:56:16.307
It was the true story
of Donald Bashor a man


1069
00:56:16.377 --> 00:56:20.735
who committed burglaries
and murdered these people.


1070
00:56:20.848 --> 00:56:23.181
It was a very powerful
piece of material.


1071
00:56:23.284 --> 00:56:24.616
Put than back right now.

1072
00:56:24.685 --> 00:56:25.607
I'm calling the police.

1073
00:56:25.686 --> 00:56:28.167
You're going to get arrested
for breaking and-- ah!


1074
00:56:28.289 --> 00:56:29.052
Oh!

1075
00:56:35.863 --> 00:56:39.186
He was frightening--
really frightening.


1076
00:56:39.300 --> 00:56:41.485
He played it so well
because it seemed to be


1077
00:56:41.569 --> 00:56:44.562
going against his own persona.

1078
00:56:44.672 --> 00:56:47.608
Here was Geraldine page from
the Actor's Studio in New York.


1079
00:56:47.675 --> 00:56:50.156
It was a whole different
way of working.


1080
00:56:50.244 --> 00:56:52.213
Tab kept up with her.

1081
00:56:52.313 --> 00:56:53.838
But I don't want to
bring you bad luck.


1082
00:56:53.914 --> 00:56:54.597
Bad luck?

1083
00:56:54.715 --> 00:56:56.900
You're my good
luck, my best luck.


1084
00:56:57.017 --> 00:56:58.542
This was big time.

1085
00:56:58.652 --> 00:57:03.602
This wasn't just some teenage
hearthrob who got a break.


1086
00:57:03.691 --> 00:57:04.704
Oh, I was proud of that show.

1087
00:57:04.825 --> 00:57:06.794
It was a good show.

1088
00:57:06.860 --> 00:57:08.886
Television was giving
me the opporunity


1089
00:57:08.996 --> 00:57:12.626
to do things that I could
not do in motion pictures,


1090
00:57:12.700 --> 00:57:16.387
with the most creative
people in the industry,


1091
00:57:16.503 --> 00:57:18.597
directors like
Sidney Lumet, John


1092
00:57:18.672 --> 00:57:21.642
Frankenheimer,
really good actors


1093
00:57:21.709 --> 00:57:24.463
and actresses and good writers.

1094
00:57:24.545 --> 00:57:27.515
I loved live television.

1095
00:57:27.581 --> 00:57:28.833
ANNOUNCER: Tab Hunter.

1096
00:57:28.916 --> 00:57:31.033
Then it stared
to click, where he


1097
00:57:31.118 --> 00:57:34.543
was getting cast in
things that made sense,


1098
00:57:34.622 --> 00:57:36.773
and he was no longer a joke.

1099
00:57:36.890 --> 00:57:37.573
Come on!

1100
00:57:37.691 --> 00:57:38.374
Just me brand them.

1101
00:57:38.459 --> 00:57:41.395
I told you to
put that gun away.


1102
00:57:41.462 --> 00:57:44.580
Yes, sir.

1103
00:57:44.698 --> 00:57:49.534
I'd played heavy on
television but never in a flm.


1104
00:57:49.603 --> 00:57:52.061
It just was such
a good character.


1105
00:57:52.139 --> 00:57:53.755
It's a pathetic.

1106
00:57:53.874 --> 00:57:56.571
From now on, I'm going my
own way, me, Ed Hackett.


1107
00:57:56.644 --> 00:57:58.465
He's a complete psychopath.

1108
00:57:58.579 --> 00:58:00.104
I'm giving you an order.

1109
00:58:00.214 --> 00:58:01.648
You can go to hell!

1110
00:58:01.715 --> 00:58:02.842
He's a racist.

1111
00:58:02.916 --> 00:58:05.545
You mean to tell me you'd
marry that no-good half breed?


1112
00:58:05.619 --> 00:58:06.871
He's a murderer.

1113
00:58:06.954 --> 00:58:08.479
Mister, you made a mistake
in pulling that gun.


1114
00:58:12.159 --> 00:58:13.684
He's just waiting to explode.

1115
00:58:16.397 --> 00:58:20.528
Of all the flms I've done,
"Gunman's Walk" was some


1116
00:58:20.601 --> 00:58:24.026
of my best work as an actor.

1117
00:58:24.104 --> 00:58:29.873
After "Gunman's Walk," Hollywood
stared to see me in a new way.


1118
00:58:29.943 --> 00:58:33.812
I stared getting cast in
some very nice productions--


1119
00:58:33.914 --> 00:58:39.012
"They Game to Cordura," with
Gary Cooper and Rita Hayworh,


1120
00:58:39.086 --> 00:58:40.520
"The Pleasure of His
Company," with Fred


1121
00:58:40.587 --> 00:58:44.103
Astaire and Debbie Reynolds,
"That Kind of Woman,"


1122
00:58:44.191 --> 00:58:46.456
with Sophia Loren.

1123
00:58:46.527 --> 00:58:49.850
These wonderful flms were not
being made at Warner Brothers,


1124
00:58:49.963 --> 00:58:51.784
where I was under contract.

1125
00:58:51.865 --> 00:58:57.327
Warners would loan me out
for like $250,000 a picture.


1126
00:58:57.438 --> 00:58:59.373
Then they would pay
me my regular Warner


1127
00:58:59.440 --> 00:59:04.572
Brothers weekly salary, and they
would pocket the difference.


1128
00:59:04.645 --> 00:59:09.003
I was getting a little
upset about that.


1129
00:59:09.116 --> 00:59:11.449
The two flms that
Natalie and I did together


1130
00:59:11.518 --> 00:59:13.976
were both big hits.

1131
00:59:14.054 --> 00:59:17.252
So the studio went and put
us together in another flm.


1132
00:59:17.357 --> 00:59:21.317
Well, I read the script, and
I thought, I can't do this.


1133
00:59:21.395 --> 00:59:24.217
I turned it down because
I knew what I liked,


1134
00:59:24.331 --> 00:59:27.199
knew what I didn't like,
and I wanted to grow.


1135
00:59:27.301 --> 00:59:29.236
I'm not a puppet.

1136
00:59:29.303 --> 00:59:33.468
So I asked the studio
for my release.


1137
00:59:33.540 --> 00:59:34.997
Well, needless to say,
Jack Warner wasn't


1138
00:59:35.075 --> 00:59:38.500
about to have that happen.

1139
00:59:38.579 --> 00:59:41.367
And I said, well, Mr. Warner,
how much would it cost'?


1140
00:59:41.482 --> 00:59:43.747
And he said, if
you want out, you


1141
00:59:43.817 --> 00:59:48.915
pay us $100,000 for the
remainder of your contract.


1142
00:59:48.989 --> 00:59:52.744
That was a lot of money,
like a couple million today.


1143
00:59:52.826 --> 00:59:56.342
But to express myself and
be my own person, I fgured,


1144
00:59:56.430 --> 00:59:58.911
I've got to do it.

1145
00:59:59.032 --> 01:00:03.026
Products of Hollywood
are interchangeable


1146
01:00:03.103 --> 01:00:05.732
and ultimately replaceable.

1147
01:00:05.839 --> 01:00:07.330
Get outta here, Dad.

1148
01:00:07.407 --> 01:00:11.845
If you weren't half
drunk I'd throw you out.


1149
01:00:11.912 --> 01:00:14.996
Troy Donahue was a young actor.

1150
01:00:15.082 --> 01:00:17.540
He was one of Henry's clients.

1151
01:00:17.618 --> 01:00:20.076
Actually, Henry Wilson tried
to stick me with that name


1152
01:00:20.187 --> 01:00:21.803
before they gave me Tab Hunter.

1153
01:00:24.424 --> 01:00:26.450
Warner Brothers was trying
to make Troy Donahue


1154
01:00:26.560 --> 01:00:28.745
in the image of Tab Hunter.

1155
01:00:28.862 --> 01:00:31.195
They stared building
Troy's career


1156
01:00:31.265 --> 01:00:35.020
and have him a very good career.

1157
01:00:35.102 --> 01:00:37.583
You've been a good old wagon,
but you done broke down.


1158
01:00:37.704 --> 01:00:40.128
(WHISTLING SOUND) You're out,
and somebody else is in there.


1159
01:00:42.743 --> 01:00:46.874
Leaving Warner Brothers
was career suicide.


1160
01:00:46.947 --> 01:00:49.246
I thought there'd be opporunity
for me at other studios,


1161
01:00:49.316 --> 01:00:53.640
but that was not the case.

1162
01:00:53.754 --> 01:00:57.179
The days of studio
contracts were over.


1163
01:00:57.257 --> 01:01:01.706
I was now a freelance
actor on my own,


1164
01:01:01.795 --> 01:01:06.324
and my primary concern was
taking care of my mother.


1165
01:01:06.433 --> 01:01:08.049
I had a lot of responsibilities.

1166
01:01:08.135 --> 01:01:11.890
And it was tough to keep
your head above water.


1167
01:01:11.972 --> 01:01:13.554
I would do anything
to pay down my debt.


1168
01:01:13.640 --> 01:01:17.725
ANNOUNCER: "Operation
Bikini," starring Tab Hunter.


1169
01:01:17.811 --> 01:01:21.441
My career was really
drying up in Hollywood.


1170
01:01:21.515 --> 01:01:24.383
So I would take
whatever was available.


1171
01:01:24.484 --> 01:01:27.420
I was no longer looking for
the keys to the kingdom.


1172
01:01:27.487 --> 01:01:30.912
ANNOUNCER: "The Golden
Arrow," starring Tab Hunter.


1173
01:01:30.991 --> 01:01:35.850
Well, not many actors can say
that they rode a fying carpet.


1174
01:01:35.963 --> 01:01:39.081
When you have to live
and you need a job,


1175
01:01:39.166 --> 01:01:40.418
you'll accept what's there.

1176
01:01:40.500 --> 01:01:42.025
ANNOUNCER: Tab
Hunter in a dual role


1177
01:01:42.135 --> 01:01:47.233
as a heroic security offcer
and a treacherous enemy agent.


1178
01:01:47.307 --> 01:01:51.506
"Birds Do It," with Soupy
Sales, that's a winner.


1179
01:01:51.612 --> 01:01:53.547
ANNOUNCER: Tab
Hunter is Steamer.


1180
01:01:53.614 --> 01:01:56.436
He goes all the way for
everhing Hawaiian.


1181
01:01:56.516 --> 01:01:58.280
To this day, people are
still coming up and saying,


1182
01:01:58.352 --> 01:02:01.618
oh, I loved you in all
those beach movies!


1183
01:02:01.688 --> 01:02:03.543
I only did one.

1184
01:02:03.657 --> 01:02:05.842
That was "Ride the Wild Surf."

1185
01:02:05.959 --> 01:02:08.929
Everybody kept thinking
of me as this surfer.


1186
01:02:08.996 --> 01:02:10.692
And at that point, I
felt that I was a little


1187
01:02:10.797 --> 01:02:12.652
long in the tooth for that one.

1188
01:02:12.733 --> 01:02:16.033
I was 32 at the time.

1189
01:02:16.136 --> 01:02:20.301
They would have a son a little
Red Flyer wagon on our knees


1190
01:02:20.374 --> 01:02:24.459
with process shot behind us
of this mountainous wave.


1191
01:02:24.544 --> 01:02:26.001
And then a prop man
would be in front of us


1192
01:02:26.079 --> 01:02:29.277
With a bucket of water going
splash-splash, splash-splash.


1193
01:02:29.383 --> 01:02:31.363
Someone point me
toward the nearest bank.


1194
01:02:31.485 --> 01:02:34.239
This was called paying
the bills and keep working.


1195
01:02:34.321 --> 01:02:35.755
That's what it's all about.

1196
01:02:35.822 --> 01:02:37.916
ANNOUNCER: "The
Tab Hunter Show--"


1197
01:02:37.991 --> 01:02:40.017
The television
series that I did,


1198
01:02:40.093 --> 01:02:41.880
This was bottom of the barrel.

1199
01:02:41.995 --> 01:02:43.429
But that's impossible.

1200
01:02:43.497 --> 01:02:46.854
This so-called comedy wound
up with a director who would


1201
01:02:46.934 --> 01:02:48.118
Say to us, come on, come on.

1202
01:02:48.235 --> 01:02:48.918
Faster!

1203
01:02:49.036 --> 01:02:49.833
Faster!

1204
01:02:49.903 --> 01:02:52.270
Fast is funny, but
faster is funnier.


1205
01:02:52.372 --> 01:02:53.829
When do you meet her?

1206
01:02:53.907 --> 01:02:55.933
Right now.

1207
01:02:56.043 --> 01:02:57.659
It was really bad stuff.

1208
01:02:57.744 --> 01:02:59.531
The bloom came off the rose.

1209
01:02:59.613 --> 01:03:01.275
My career was going
(WHISTLING SOUND).


1210
01:03:01.381 --> 01:03:02.337
Beat it, Tab.

1211
01:03:02.416 --> 01:03:04.510
Can't you see I'm busy'?

1212
01:03:04.584 --> 01:03:06.951
Without the protection
of the studio,


1213
01:03:07.054 --> 01:03:11.492
My boy-nex-door image
was in total free fall.


1214
01:03:11.558 --> 01:03:16.656
People could say and write
what they wanted, and they did.


1215
01:03:16.730 --> 01:03:19.393
If I had still been
under contract,


1216
01:03:19.466 --> 01:03:23.335
They'd have nailed it like that.

1217
01:03:23.437 --> 01:03:28.774
I was sick of Hollywood,
sick of the media,


1218
01:03:28.875 --> 01:03:30.969
And I had just about
lost faith in everhing.


1219
01:34:45.085 --> 01:34:49.739
As I was doing flms, I would
always run back to the stable.


1220
01:34:49.823 --> 01:34:53.021
The thing about being
alone on a horse,


1221
01:34:53.126 --> 01:34:57.928
it helps you divorce
yourself from yourself


1222
01:34:57.998 --> 01:34:59.489
because you're
working with an animal


1223
01:34:59.600 --> 01:35:02.627
that has a life of its own.

1224
01:35:02.703 --> 01:35:06.663
It's a marriage that's
quite marvelous.


1225
01:35:06.773 --> 01:35:09.891
I found that my touch of reality
in that unrealistic world


1226
01:35:09.977 --> 01:35:10.740
of Hollywood.

1227
01:35:14.114 --> 01:35:16.595
He was riding a jumper.

1228
01:35:16.683 --> 01:35:20.609
I was in awe of him
because of how he rode.


1229
01:35:20.687 --> 01:35:23.885
I was standing at the back gate,
and we just stared talking.


1230
01:35:23.991 --> 01:35:26.085
I didn't know who he was.

1231
01:35:26.159 --> 01:35:29.186
And he asked me questions
like, do I ride'?


1232
01:35:29.296 --> 01:35:33.256
And I said, oh, yeah,
I grew up on a horse.


1233
01:35:33.333 --> 01:35:34.995
He said, do you
ride jumping horses?


1234
01:35:35.068 --> 01:35:36.730
And I said, no,
I've not done that,


1235
01:35:36.837 --> 01:35:40.103
but the thought appeals to me.

1236
01:35:40.173 --> 01:35:43.769
And he said, I'd be willing
to teach you some jumping.


1237
01:35:43.844 --> 01:35:45.870
So I took him up on it.

1238
01:35:45.979 --> 01:35:50.633
And so we became
friends after that.


1239
01:35:50.717 --> 01:35:52.504
He didn't have
all the trappings,


1240
01:35:52.586 --> 01:35:56.102
I didn't think, that
a star would have.


1241
01:35:56.223 --> 01:35:57.657
He was very real person.

1242
01:36:03.530 --> 01:36:07.456
It was the frst long-term
relationship that I ever had.


1243
01:36:07.534 --> 01:36:09.514
We were together for
about seven years.


1244
01:36:13.840 --> 01:36:16.469
Hollywood turned
their back on him.


1245
01:36:16.543 --> 01:36:21.800
And I realized what it must
be like to be very popular


1246
01:36:21.882 --> 01:36:25.967
and to be very unpopular.

1247
01:36:26.053 --> 01:36:28.648
I cerainly
commiserated with him.


1248
01:36:28.722 --> 01:36:31.351
But he didn't ever want
to talk about it much.


1249
01:36:31.425 --> 01:36:33.394
ANNOUNCER: Tab has been
out of town for a while.


1250
01:36:33.460 --> 01:36:36.612
Now he's back, just horsing
around, waiting for the day


1251
01:36:36.730 --> 01:36:38.699
he's discovered again.

1252
01:36:38.765 --> 01:36:41.758
I was very concerned.

1253
01:36:41.868 --> 01:36:46.488
So I bought space in "Variety"
to just tell people hello.


1254
01:36:46.573 --> 01:36:48.189
Is there any possibility
of you getting


1255
01:36:48.275 --> 01:36:49.857
job somewhere around here?

1256
01:36:49.943 --> 01:36:51.275
I just wanted people
to know that I wasn't


1257
01:36:51.378 --> 01:36:53.199
dead, that I'm still alive.

1258
01:36:53.280 --> 01:36:55.977
And a couple responses- really
sweet people-- said, yeah,


1259
01:36:56.083 --> 01:36:58.234
get lost, or yeah, drop dead.

1260
01:36:58.318 --> 01:37:01.345
Tab Hunter, who was every
high school girl's idea


1261
01:37:01.455 --> 01:37:03.481
of a dream boat--
he was a boy who


1262
01:37:03.590 --> 01:37:05.707
never seemed to get any older.

1263
01:37:05.792 --> 01:37:07.579
Well, he has.

1264
01:37:07.661 --> 01:37:10.483
Well, I might as well have
been a relic from the silent era


1265
01:37:10.597 --> 01:37:12.259
because people
wanted real people


1266
01:37:12.332 --> 01:37:17.191
in real situations, no more
Hollywood made-up personas.


1267
01:37:17.304 --> 01:37:19.068
We want to be free to ride
our machines without being


1268
01:37:19.139 --> 01:37:19.936
hassled by the man.

1269
01:37:22.309 --> 01:37:24.972
TAB HUNTER: The new actors
were anti-establishment,


1270
01:37:25.078 --> 01:37:29.163
and I was apple pie
and All-American.


1271
01:37:29.249 --> 01:37:31.275
It would have
taken some director


1272
01:37:31.351 --> 01:37:34.776
to give him the kind of a
par that would make everybody


1273
01:37:34.855 --> 01:37:37.154
look at him in a new way.

1274
01:37:37.257 --> 01:37:39.408
In order to make the
change, he would have had


1275
01:37:39.493 --> 01:37:43.089
to do something really radical.

1276
01:37:43.163 --> 01:37:45.428
This was a low-budget
horror flm--


1277
01:37:46.967 --> 01:37:49.596
--made on a show string.

1278
01:37:49.669 --> 01:37:52.696
It needed a very
handsome debonair man


1279
01:37:52.806 --> 01:37:54.422
who would love women to death.

1280
01:37:58.645 --> 01:38:00.466
Tab Hunter would
be the last person


1281
01:38:00.547 --> 01:38:03.176
you would expect to do that.

1282
01:38:03.283 --> 01:38:07.607
TAB HUNTER: "Sweet Kill"
was cerainly way out there.


1283
01:38:07.687 --> 01:38:11.522
I did it because the movie roles
were just not coming along.


1284
01:38:14.895 --> 01:38:18.696
Tab was so much a par
of that Eisenhower era.


1285
01:38:18.799 --> 01:38:22.816
The '50s, as an era, was
repudiated in the '60s.


1286
01:38:22.903 --> 01:38:24.519
Young people are
the only people


1287
01:38:24.638 --> 01:38:26.789
in this whole country that
have saved the soul of America.


1288
01:38:31.478 --> 01:38:34.801
It was a completely
changed world.


1289
01:38:34.881 --> 01:38:39.899
America was at war with itself
as well as at war with Vetnam.


1290
01:38:42.823 --> 01:38:47.181
My brother was in military
medical evacuations.


1291
01:38:47.260 --> 01:38:49.855
He had joined the Navy.

1292
01:38:49.930 --> 01:38:54.095
He wound up in Vetnam,
as so many young men did.


1293
01:38:57.070 --> 01:39:01.155
I was at a horse show at the
Cow Palace in San Francisco.


1294
01:39:01.241 --> 01:39:03.506
And I was sitting on my horse
at the back gate waiting


1295
01:39:03.577 --> 01:39:05.944
for the announcer to
announce my horse Nob Hill


1296
01:39:06.046 --> 01:39:09.346
and myself for the nex
entry into the arena.


1297
01:39:09.416 --> 01:39:11.749
And I saw a man in
military uniform coming,


1298
01:39:11.852 --> 01:39:18.816
and he walked over to me, and
he said, are you Ar Gelien?


1299
01:39:18.892 --> 01:39:24.354
I just want to tell you your
brother was killed in Vetnam.


1300
01:39:24.431 --> 01:39:26.548
I thought, why him?

1301
01:39:26.633 --> 01:39:28.329
Why not me'?

1302
01:39:28.435 --> 01:39:29.869
Walt was married, and
he had seven children.


1303
01:39:33.306 --> 01:39:38.802
I remember taking the moment,
closing my eyes, and saying,


1304
01:39:38.912 --> 01:39:42.872
Walt, I'm gonna win
this class for you.


1305
01:39:45.485 --> 01:39:47.067
And my horse won the
class that night.


1306
01:39:49.956 --> 01:39:53.609
And then afterwards I
went back to the barn.


1307
01:39:53.727 --> 01:39:59.428
And when I was in the stall with
my horse, I totally lost it.


1308
01:39:59.499 --> 01:40:02.799
I was scared of my own shadow.

1309
01:40:02.903 --> 01:40:05.600
My brother was the one who
opened the doors of life


1310
01:40:05.672 --> 01:40:08.039
for me.

1311
01:40:08.141 --> 01:40:09.666
I really looked
up to him so much.


1312
01:40:16.416 --> 01:40:21.252
My mother was very stoic
about my brother's death.


1313
01:40:21.321 --> 01:40:25.850
She was getting better,
but it took a while.


1314
01:40:25.959 --> 01:40:27.621
I was very concerned
about her well-being,


1315
01:40:27.694 --> 01:40:30.061
and I would see her a great
deal more than I had when I was


1316
01:40:30.163 --> 01:40:33.190
running around with the movies.

1317
01:40:33.300 --> 01:40:36.600
I found her a little
aparment in Long Beach.


1318
01:40:36.670 --> 01:40:38.252
Whatever she need, I
would be there for her.


1319
01:40:41.341 --> 01:40:44.607
Well, I made a promise to my
mother to take care of her.


1320
01:40:44.678 --> 01:40:47.830
And I defnitely was
going to keep it.


1321
01:40:47.948 --> 01:40:50.372
I had to create
work in some way.


1322
01:40:52.953 --> 01:40:54.285
I discovered dinner theater.

1323
01:40:56.890 --> 01:41:00.088
Dinner theater was a place where
people could come and stuff


1324
01:41:00.193 --> 01:41:03.311
their faces, then sit back,
and while they were getting


1325
01:41:03.396 --> 01:41:07.925
to belch, watch the show they
you were doing. (LAUGHING)


1326
01:41:08.034 --> 01:41:11.232
They were becoming
very, very popular.


1327
01:41:11.338 --> 01:41:15.298
There was a stigma attached
to working dinner theaters.


1328
01:41:15.375 --> 01:41:21.167
They said that it was the place
that old actors went to die.


1329
01:41:21.248 --> 01:41:22.773
I was making more
money at dinner theater


1330
01:41:22.882 --> 01:41:25.579
than I was waiting for a picture
now and then in Hollywood,


1331
01:41:25.685 --> 01:41:28.507
that's for sure--
six weeks here,


1332
01:41:28.588 --> 01:41:33.390
eight weeks there, four weeks
here, all over the country.


1333
01:41:33.493 --> 01:41:37.362
I felt I had to keep going once
you put yourself in that gear.


1334
01:41:37.430 --> 01:41:41.117
I was on the road constantly.

1335
01:41:41.234 --> 01:41:42.691
INTERVlEWER: Your
story in "Here Lies


1336
01:41:42.769 --> 01:41:44.385
Jeremy Troy," which
is at the Grand


1337
01:41:44.504 --> 01:41:45.597
Dinner Theater in Anaheim--

1338
01:41:45.672 --> 01:41:46.355
That's right.

1339
01:41:46.439 --> 01:41:47.418
We'll be there for eight weeks.

1340
01:41:47.540 --> 01:41:50.021
It's right opposite the
entrance to Disneyland.


1341
01:41:50.110 --> 01:41:54.730
It's a very lonely,
lonely existence.


1342
01:41:54.848 --> 01:41:57.033
You perform in front
of 1,500 people,


1343
01:41:57.117 --> 01:42:01.077
and you go home to a hotel
room in the middle of nowhere


1344
01:42:01.187 --> 01:42:03.520
by yourself.

1345
01:42:03.590 --> 01:42:07.459
Working at dinner theater
was very exhausting.


1346
01:42:07.560 --> 01:42:11.315
And doing that every single
night took a toll on me.


1347
01:42:11.398 --> 01:42:13.094
I wore myself right
into the ground


1348
01:42:13.199 --> 01:42:16.397
to the point of where
I had a hear attack.


1349
01:42:16.469 --> 01:42:20.270
I was sure that it
could be the end.


1350
01:42:24.110 --> 01:42:26.625
I was wondering if I was
going to be able to make it,


1351
01:42:26.746 --> 01:42:29.773
and I was praying a lot.

1352
01:42:29.883 --> 01:42:33.877
I did give up dinner
theater after that.


1353
01:42:33.953 --> 01:42:36.923
I learned to try to relax a bit.

1354
01:42:36.990 --> 01:42:39.505
I learned to be grateful
for every moment


1355
01:42:39.626 --> 01:42:40.457
and thankful- thankful.

1356
01:42:46.633 --> 01:42:49.057
I love the church.

1357
01:42:49.135 --> 01:42:51.286
I love my religion.

1358
01:42:51.404 --> 01:42:54.829
But I still just felt
like I was such an outcast


1359
01:42:54.908 --> 01:42:55.705
because of my sexuality.

1360
01:43:00.113 --> 01:43:01.638
It took a long time for
me to fnd my way back.


1361
01:43:05.318 --> 01:43:07.776
It was so peaceful,
and it was so imporant


1362
01:43:07.854 --> 01:43:12.178
that I try to
be a par of it.

1363
01:43:12.292 --> 01:43:15.945
And I struck up a conversation
with a priest who I felt


1364
01:43:16.029 --> 01:43:18.999
I can really communicate with.

1365
01:43:19.099 --> 01:43:20.920
I told him I was a
Catholic, and I told him I


1366
01:43:21.000 --> 01:43:25.131
had some terrible reservations.

1367
01:43:25.205 --> 01:43:27.299
He was so receptive.

1368
01:43:27.374 --> 01:43:31.459
And he really made me
feel better about myself.


1369
01:43:34.214 --> 01:43:40.734
He was discovering something
about his own truth.


1370
01:43:40.854 --> 01:43:45.474
For a man to have to live
in someone else's presuming


1371
01:43:45.558 --> 01:43:51.259
about who you should love,
how do you ever know yourself?


1372
01:43:51.364 --> 01:43:55.199
He was going to go where
his hear told him to go.


1373
01:43:57.871 --> 01:44:02.969
By going back to my church
and my beliefs, that really,


1374
01:44:03.042 --> 01:44:08.140
really helped me through
a very diffcult period.


1375
01:44:08.214 --> 01:44:12.709
And little by little, I just
felt the weight of the world


1376
01:44:12.819 --> 01:44:14.003
was lifted from me.

1377
01:44:22.395 --> 01:44:24.375
I knew Tab is an
image, you know'?


1378
01:44:24.497 --> 01:44:26.762
And that was the thing that
was so very imporant to me


1379
01:44:26.833 --> 01:44:29.348
and why I so much wanted
him to be in Polyester."


1380
01:44:29.436 --> 01:44:31.257
It's Todd, honey.

1381
01:44:31.371 --> 01:44:32.350
Todd?

1382
01:44:32.439 --> 01:44:33.805
Todd Tomorrow?

1383
01:44:33.907 --> 01:44:36.172
John Waters called me up
on the telephone and said,


1384
01:44:36.242 --> 01:44:39.758
I've got a script I'd like you
to read for a flm with Divine.


1385
01:44:39.879 --> 01:44:41.313
What do you think, sweethear?

1386
01:44:41.381 --> 01:44:44.169
Oh, it's very high brow, Todd.

1387
01:44:44.250 --> 01:44:45.741
And then he said,
how would you feel


1388
01:44:45.852 --> 01:44:48.185
about kissing a

1389
01:44:48.254 --> 01:44:50.735
(LAUGHING) And I
just said, I'm sure


1390
01:44:50.857 --> 01:44:54.157
I've kissed a hell
of a lot worse.


1391
01:44:54.227 --> 01:44:56.890
John's flms were outrageous.

1392
01:44:56.963 --> 01:44:59.785
I prayed that he would never
go watch "Pink Flamingos."


1393
01:44:59.899 --> 01:45:01.754
Happy birhday, fatso.

1394
01:45:01.868 --> 01:45:02.790
Oh!

1395
01:45:02.869 --> 01:45:03.882
And he did.

1396
01:45:03.970 --> 01:45:06.394
How could anyone be
flthier than Divine'?


1397
01:45:06.473 --> 01:45:10.922
Even then, he didn't
say, oh, well, never mind.


1398
01:45:11.044 --> 01:45:13.639
He was unafraid.

1399
01:45:13.713 --> 01:45:16.308
I remember an agent
saying to me at the time,


1400
01:45:16.382 --> 01:45:18.317
you can't do that flm.

1401
01:45:18.384 --> 01:45:21.411
And my response was,
what have I got to lose'?


1402
01:45:21.488 --> 01:45:23.275
Where's my career now'?

1403
01:45:23.389 --> 01:45:25.176
I thought this will
be a lot of fun.


1404
01:45:25.258 --> 01:45:27.523
Why don't you show me
your bedroom, honey'?


1405
01:45:27.594 --> 01:45:28.516
Mother may I'?

1406
01:45:28.595 --> 01:45:29.392
Yes, you may.

1407
01:45:29.462 --> 01:45:30.225
Ooh!

1408
01:45:30.296 --> 01:45:33.289
I could only afford
him for one week.


1409
01:45:33.399 --> 01:45:35.994
I'm sure it was the least
Tab Hunter was ever paid,


1410
01:45:36.069 --> 01:45:39.870
and it was by far the most
I had ever paid anybody.


1411
01:45:39.939 --> 01:45:43.137
Doing a flm for John, you
got to fnd a spot on the foor


1412
01:45:43.243 --> 01:45:46.600
where you can sit down between
takes-- cold pizza at 2:00


1413
01:45:46.679 --> 01:45:47.965
AM. (mum-nus)

1414
01:45:48.081 --> 01:45:49.333
Are you my little fesh pot?

1415
01:45:49.415 --> 01:45:50.576
Mm-hmm.

1416
01:45:50.650 --> 01:45:52.630
It was the frst
time ever we had


1417
01:45:52.752 --> 01:45:54.903
quote, "a real
movie star" come in


1418
01:45:54.988 --> 01:45:57.958
and work with my movie stars.

1419
01:45:58.024 --> 01:46:01.472
Tab made out with
Divine who was in drag.


1420
01:46:01.594 --> 01:46:04.621
People could not
believe their eyes.


1421
01:46:04.697 --> 01:46:07.849
That's why the movie worked
because they together


1422
01:46:07.967 --> 01:46:10.664
were a great screen couple.

1423
01:46:10.770 --> 01:46:12.534
A couple of people said,
oh, don't worry about it.


1424
01:46:12.605 --> 01:46:15.120
Nobody's gonna see this flm.

1425
01:46:15.208 --> 01:46:16.392
The movie came out.

1426
01:46:16.509 --> 01:46:17.841
It was a hit.

1427
01:46:17.944 --> 01:46:20.402
And it defnitely
revitalized my career.


1428
01:46:20.480 --> 01:46:23.416
Mr. Tab Hunter, yay!

1429
01:46:23.483 --> 01:46:25.338
Well, there was a
whole new audience


1430
01:46:25.451 --> 01:46:27.477
that never heard of Tab Hunter.

1431
01:46:27.554 --> 01:46:28.886
Now, what is the
best time of the month


1432
01:46:28.988 --> 01:46:31.685
for a woman to conceive?

1433
01:46:31.791 --> 01:46:33.908
I feel like a new old
face or an old new face.


1434
01:46:33.993 --> 01:46:36.019
So I'm getting my toe in the
door to star all over again.


1435
01:46:36.129 --> 01:46:37.984
It's very exciting

1436
01:46:38.064 --> 01:46:40.158
Tab was serious
about his career.


1437
01:46:40.233 --> 01:46:42.054
But he never took
himself that seriously.


1438
01:46:42.168 --> 01:46:43.500
DR. ERNO: Tab, what do
you do for a living?


1439
01:46:43.570 --> 01:46:45.721
Well, Erno, I'm a
Hollywood movie star,


1440
01:46:45.838 --> 01:46:48.831
and I've been in over 40 flms,
and I lived in Beverly Hills.


1441
01:46:48.908 --> 01:46:50.092
That sounds exciting.

1442
01:46:50.209 --> 01:46:53.407
He found himself amusing.

1443
01:46:53.513 --> 01:46:55.994
When you have a sense
of humor about yourself,


1444
01:46:56.082 --> 01:46:57.664
people appreciate
you in another way.


1445
01:47:02.155 --> 01:47:05.239
I wanted to work
with Divine again.


1446
01:47:05.325 --> 01:47:09.251
I had come up with the idea
of doing a Western comedy.


1447
01:47:09.329 --> 01:47:11.298
It was called
"Lust in the Dust."


1448
01:47:11.364 --> 01:47:13.515
ANNOUNCER: Tab Hunter
is the stranger.


1449
01:47:14.400 --> 01:47:19.088
And Divine is Rosy Valdez.

1450
01:47:19.205 --> 01:47:19.968
Come and get it.

1451
01:47:20.039 --> 01:47:21.803
I turned over every
stone I possibly


1452
01:47:21.874 --> 01:47:25.504
could trying to get "Lust
in the Dust" going forward.


1453
01:47:25.578 --> 01:47:28.093
The frst time I
saw Tab in person


1454
01:47:28.214 --> 01:47:29.648
was when he walked
into my offce


1455
01:47:29.716 --> 01:47:32.800
at Fox to pitch
"Lust in the Dust."


1456
01:47:32.885 --> 01:47:36.902
Tab still had that star quality.

1457
01:47:37.023 --> 01:47:39.208
And I mentioned the
project to Allan.


1458
01:47:39.292 --> 01:47:43.457
And he hit on it right away and
said, what a wonderful idea.


1459
01:47:43.563 --> 01:47:45.896
Once Tab left the
meeting, I thought, yeah,


1460
01:47:45.965 --> 01:47:49.322
"Lust in the Dust" could work.

1461
01:47:49.435 --> 01:47:53.566
I knew I could trust
him almost immediately.


1462
01:47:53.640 --> 01:47:57.236
I found Allan very
attractive, very bright,


1463
01:47:57.310 --> 01:48:00.007
and I wanted to spend
more time with him.


1464
01:48:00.113 --> 01:48:02.412
Tab stared calling me.

1465
01:48:02.482 --> 01:48:03.939
And I thought
initially it was just


1466
01:48:04.050 --> 01:48:07.316
a follow up about "Lust in the
Dust," but it went beyond that.


1467
01:48:10.757 --> 01:48:13.875
Tab was 30 years
older and I was.


1468
01:48:13.960 --> 01:48:15.542
I was 23.

1469
01:48:15.628 --> 01:48:17.779
Tabb was 53.

1470
01:48:17.897 --> 01:48:20.230
But once we did
connect, I couldn't


1471
01:48:20.299 --> 01:48:23.269
imagine us not being together.

1472
01:48:23.336 --> 01:48:26.602
And then the more our
personal relationship grew,


1473
01:48:26.673 --> 01:48:31.771
the more I was determined
to get that movie done.


1474
01:48:31.844 --> 01:48:34.029
I tried to get it
going at Fox, and there


1475
01:48:34.147 --> 01:48:35.331
was a little bit of
interest, but they


1476
01:48:35.448 --> 01:48:37.906
ultimately passed on it.

1477
01:48:37.984 --> 01:48:41.466
Tab said to me I should get
involved and produce this.


1478
01:48:41.587 --> 01:48:45.012
Well, that would mean having
to leave my secure job


1479
01:48:45.091 --> 01:48:50.428
at Fox, which I did.

1480
01:48:50.496 --> 01:48:53.853
People told me I was taking a
big risk leaving the studio.


1481
01:48:53.966 --> 01:48:55.821
But I had a hunch
that my future would


1482
01:48:55.935 --> 01:48:59.565
be better with Tab, so I left.

1483
01:48:59.639 --> 01:49:02.962
He single-handedly raised
all the money for that flm.


1484
01:49:03.042 --> 01:49:04.624
You got it all wrong, honey.

1485
01:49:04.711 --> 01:49:06.828
You've been cheap all your life.

1486
01:49:06.946 --> 01:49:07.629
Cheap?

1487
01:49:07.714 --> 01:49:10.047
I was the sister of Divine.

1488
01:49:10.149 --> 01:49:12.084
This furniture is cheap.

1489
01:49:12.151 --> 01:49:14.131
I looked like a
drag queen, you know'?


1490
01:49:14.220 --> 01:49:17.304
(LAUGHING) I think
that was the idea.


1491
01:49:17.390 --> 01:49:21.839
My love scene with Tab
Hunter- we were in a shower.


1492
01:49:21.961 --> 01:49:22.724
It was delicious.

1493
01:49:26.132 --> 01:49:29.785
The frst flm I ever appeared
in was "Lust in the Dust."


1494
01:49:29.869 --> 01:49:32.896
That set, in paricular, had a
real sense of frivolity and fun


1495
01:49:33.005 --> 01:49:33.688
about it.

1496
01:49:33.806 --> 01:49:36.287
And I remember being
struck by Tab's naturalism


1497
01:49:36.375 --> 01:49:40.631
and how efforlessly everhing
he was doing was coming across.


1498
01:49:40.713 --> 01:49:42.739
Vctory shifts from man to man.

1499
01:49:42.849 --> 01:49:44.010
Deuteronomy'?

1500
01:49:44.083 --> 01:49:45.745
Homer.

1501
01:49:45.852 --> 01:49:49.607
Everybody was sor of
playing it larger than life.


1502
01:49:49.689 --> 01:49:52.443
"Lust in the Dust"
was well received,


1503
01:49:52.525 --> 01:49:58.658
and it cerainly opened doors
for us to do other things.


1504
01:49:58.731 --> 01:50:01.758
ALLAN GLASER: Tab
defnitely had a value.


1505
01:50:01.868 --> 01:50:07.569
I got a lot of meetings just
because Tab was attached.


1506
01:50:07.673 --> 01:50:09.460
We were doing these
independent projects,


1507
01:50:09.542 --> 01:50:13.798
and Tab's celebrity helped
me raise the fnancing.


1508
01:50:13.880 --> 01:50:16.338
It was a very
productive time for us.


1509
01:50:16.415 --> 01:50:21.012
For me, it was a challenge to
make it work, which I enjoyed.


1510
01:50:21.087 --> 01:50:23.511
But not so much for Tab.

1511
01:50:23.589 --> 01:50:25.171
He didn't fnd that
same excitement


1512
01:50:25.258 --> 01:50:28.683
that I found in trying to
get these projects going.


1513
01:50:28.761 --> 01:50:30.343
Well, I never paid a
lot of attention what


1514
01:50:30.429 --> 01:50:31.522
was happening in Hollywood.

1515
01:50:31.597 --> 01:50:32.758
I let Allan do all
of that because he


1516
01:50:32.865 --> 01:50:33.992
was really good at it.

1517
01:50:34.066 --> 01:50:34.749
How are you'?

1518
01:50:34.867 --> 01:50:35.789
Tab Hunter.

1519
01:50:35.868 --> 01:50:41.057
By this time, Tab wasn't
too happy to continue acting.


1520
01:50:41.140 --> 01:50:45.908
Tab was still getting offers,
but he turned 90% of everhing


1521
01:50:45.978 --> 01:50:47.503
he was offered down.

1522
01:50:50.983 --> 01:50:55.068
People were coming out, and
that was their choice to do so,


1523
01:50:55.154 --> 01:50:57.749
and I respect that.

1524
01:50:57.824 --> 01:51:04.128
Personally, I didn't want my
sexuality to defne who I was.


1525
01:51:04.230 --> 01:51:06.711
I just didn't talk about.

1526
01:51:06.799 --> 01:51:09.553
It's not my comfor zone.

1527
01:51:09.635 --> 01:51:13.265
I was point-blank asked
about my sexuality.


1528
01:51:13.339 --> 01:51:17.026
Wasn't it diffcult
to be in a closet?


1529
01:51:17.143 --> 01:51:21.592
Some of the press occasionally
would cross that boundary,


1530
01:51:21.681 --> 01:51:23.616
I'm entitled to have
that line there,


1531
01:51:23.683 --> 01:51:28.974
and if I don't want to share
that with you, I won't.


1532
01:51:29.088 --> 01:51:30.613
I think it probably
means I fnally made it.


1533
01:51:30.690 --> 01:51:32.545
I mean, you can't be a star
without having a gay rumor out


1534
01:51:32.658 --> 01:51:34.479
there, can you'? (LAUGHING)

1535
01:51:34.594 --> 01:51:36.290
In some respects,
the business is


1536
01:51:36.362 --> 01:51:38.627
still like it was in the '50s.

1537
01:51:38.698 --> 01:51:41.896
It may be a lot more
socially acceptable to be gay.


1538
01:51:42.001 --> 01:51:44.482
But I know several
people who are very


1539
01:51:44.604 --> 01:51:48.598
prominent in this industry who
feel, perhaps legitimately,


1540
01:51:48.674 --> 01:51:51.940
that if they came out it would
affect their box offce appeal.


1541
01:51:52.011 --> 01:51:56.369
Let's put it this way, fellas,
a Gillette shave turns a trick.


1542
01:51:56.482 --> 01:52:02.012
For someone who is the fantasy
for women all across America


1543
01:52:02.121 --> 01:52:06.616
and the world, to come
out in the public and say,


1544
01:52:06.692 --> 01:52:12.518
I'm gay and expect to play
leading men is an issue.


1545
01:52:12.632 --> 01:52:14.965
It's still tricky.

1546
01:52:15.034 --> 01:52:18.516
Every actor who has a
secret, like being gay,


1547
01:52:18.638 --> 01:52:21.756
there's a par of us that
are afraid of Hollywood.


1548
01:52:21.841 --> 01:52:26.199
We're afraid to be
who we are completely.


1549
01:52:26.312 --> 01:52:29.282
That's a hard life to lead.

1550
01:52:29.348 --> 01:52:33.365
After decades of being in
the public eye, all I wanted


1551
01:52:33.486 --> 01:52:35.637
was my privacy.

1552
01:52:35.721 --> 01:52:40.489
In order to achieve that, I just
withdrew from it all for good.


1553
01:52:47.533 --> 01:52:49.513
My life had been very transient.

1554
01:52:52.171 --> 01:52:55.619
I never thought
of settling down.


1555
01:52:55.708 --> 01:52:59.133
But then Allan came
into my life and just


1556
01:52:59.211 --> 01:53:00.702
opened up whole new vistas.

1557
01:53:04.350 --> 01:53:06.979
We're so much of a
par of each other


1558
01:53:07.053 --> 01:53:09.750
now because we have been
together for so long.


1559
01:53:09.855 --> 01:53:11.881
And it's just one
of those things.


1560
01:53:11.958 --> 01:53:14.621
It works.

1561
01:53:14.727 --> 01:53:17.811
Allan's a very
stabilizing infuence.


1562
01:53:17.897 --> 01:53:21.493
I have a wonderful
relationship with Allan that's


1563
01:53:21.567 --> 01:53:25.163
grown over SO-some years.

1564
01:53:25.237 --> 01:53:28.503
This is really an
incredible person that I


1565
01:53:28.574 --> 01:53:29.428
want to spend my life with.

1566
01:53:35.648 --> 01:53:38.948
What brings Tab pleasure
on a daily basis,


1567
01:53:39.051 --> 01:53:42.852
and I can sum it up in
one word, is Harlow.


1568
01:53:42.922 --> 01:53:45.346
This old cow, look at her.

1569
01:53:45.424 --> 01:53:50.283
ALLAN GLASER: Harlow, Tab's
horse, is what gives Tab joy.


1570
01:53:50.396 --> 01:53:52.763
This is what makes me happiest.

1571
01:53:52.832 --> 01:53:55.461
This is where I really
feel more at ease


1572
01:53:55.568 --> 01:53:57.230
than I would anywhere else.

1573
01:53:57.303 --> 01:53:59.238
It's getting up in
the morning, having


1574
01:53:59.305 --> 01:54:03.595
to go clean out that stall,
having to groom that horse.


1575
01:54:03.676 --> 01:54:06.464
Whoa, listen to
your belly growl!


1576
01:54:06.579 --> 01:54:09.697
That sounds like a pretty good
life-- riding horses and just


1577
01:54:09.782 --> 01:54:11.546
kind of cooling his heels.

1578
01:54:11.617 --> 01:54:14.553
OK move your tush, sweethear.

1579
01:54:14.620 --> 01:54:16.111
He's a better man than I am.

1580
01:54:16.188 --> 01:54:19.272
I try to stay away from
anything weighing 1,400 pounds


1581
01:54:19.358 --> 01:54:22.510
and has a brain the
size of a walnut.


1582
01:54:22.628 --> 01:54:26.463
When you have a passion
that fulflls you,


1583
01:54:26.532 --> 01:54:32.062
you don't look to other
areas to fll you up.


1584
01:54:32.171 --> 01:54:36.370
Tab is an incredible
horseman and always has been,


1585
01:54:36.475 --> 01:54:40.913
and that is a career in itself.

1586
01:54:40.980 --> 01:54:45.111
Well, my acting career I look
at as being all in the past.


1587
01:54:45.184 --> 01:54:49.383
I loved it, bud I love
where I am now in my life.


1588
01:54:49.488 --> 01:54:51.343
And I am happy to be forgotten.

1589
01:54:57.730 --> 01:55:00.245
Tab's attitude to
his Hollywood career


1590
01:55:00.366 --> 01:55:02.392
is been there, done that.

1591
01:55:02.501 --> 01:55:05.494
He calls it his past life,
which drives me nuts.


1592
01:55:05.571 --> 01:55:07.506
I found this is at fea market.

1593
01:55:07.573 --> 01:55:09.758
It's something that
he could embrace,


1594
01:55:09.875 --> 01:55:10.854
but he doesn't care to do it.

1595
01:55:10.976 --> 01:55:11.659
He did it.

1596
01:55:11.744 --> 01:55:13.713
He let go of it.

1597
01:55:13.813 --> 01:55:16.806
He doesn't even want to
see himself on television.


1598
01:55:16.882 --> 01:55:21.479
If he's laying in bed and an
old movie of his comes on,


1599
01:55:21.554 --> 01:55:24.012
he doesn't stop for one second.

1600
01:55:24.090 --> 01:55:25.103
Forget it.

1601
01:55:25.224 --> 01:55:26.715
ALLAN GLASER: He just
fips through the channel


1602
01:55:26.826 --> 01:55:29.944
like it was a dog food
commercial and keeps going.


1603
01:55:30.029 --> 01:55:31.816
Well, a-- a boy's best
friend is his mother.


1604
01:55:35.367 --> 01:55:37.461
We were casting
"Lust in the Dust,"


1605
01:55:37.536 --> 01:55:40.358
and there was this character
named Hardcase Williams.


1606
01:55:40.439 --> 01:55:44.763
And I thought Tony Perkins
would be perfect for that role.


1607
01:55:44.877 --> 01:55:49.201
ANNOUNCER: 22 years later,
Norman Bates is home.


1608
01:55:49.281 --> 01:55:51.978
"Psycho II" had just come out.

1609
01:55:52.084 --> 01:55:55.236
Tony was getting a tremendous
amount of publicity.


1610
01:55:55.354 --> 01:55:57.380
Tab was having a
career resurgence


1611
01:55:57.456 --> 01:56:01.291
at the same exact
time Tony Perkins was.


1612
01:56:01.393 --> 01:56:05.888
He said, Tony Perkins--
do you know him'?


1613
01:56:05.965 --> 01:56:08.833
(LAUGHING) I said,
yeah, Allan, I know him.


1614
01:56:08.934 --> 01:56:14.100
(LAUGHING) I contacted
Tony, went up


1615
01:56:14.206 --> 01:56:16.960
to his house up on Mulholland.

1616
01:56:17.042 --> 01:56:20.490
I hadn't seen him
in a long while.


1617
01:56:20.579 --> 01:56:23.902
His wife Mary answered the door.

1618
01:56:23.983 --> 01:56:26.441
Tony had married, had a family.

1619
01:56:26.552 --> 01:56:29.750
And I presented Tony
with the script.


1620
01:56:29.822 --> 01:56:31.518
And he said he really
would like to do it,


1621
01:56:31.624 --> 01:56:33.559
but he just didn't think it
was the right project for him


1622
01:56:33.626 --> 01:56:35.811
at the time.

1623
01:56:35.928 --> 01:56:39.251
And Tony and I said
goodbye that afternoon,


1624
01:56:39.331 --> 01:56:42.529
and that was the last
time that I saw Tony.


1625
01:56:42.635 --> 01:56:45.958
AIDS has taken the life
of actor Anthony Perkins.


1626
01:56:46.071 --> 01:56:50.930
He died Saturday at
his Los Angeles home.


1627
01:56:51.010 --> 01:56:55.448
I never felt that Tony was
struggling with his identity.


1628
01:56:55.514 --> 01:56:59.599
And when I did hear of it, I
was really quite surprised.


1629
01:56:59.685 --> 01:57:05.818
Maybe he was deep down unhappy
with himself about being gay


1630
01:57:05.925 --> 01:57:08.713
and wanted to change that.

1631
01:57:08.794 --> 01:57:11.309
His choice was right
for him, and it's


1632
01:57:11.430 --> 01:57:15.231
all par of a person's growth.

1633
01:57:15.301 --> 01:57:20.103
Tony was who he was, or
maybe he wanted to be.


1634
01:57:20.172 --> 01:57:22.539
That was good enough for me.

1635
01:57:22.641 --> 01:57:27.170
I had no right- no one does--
to be judgmental or to second


1636
01:57:27.279 --> 01:57:28.736
guess his pursuit of happiness.

1637
01:57:31.617 --> 01:57:35.907
There are an awful lot of
people who have feelings,


1638
01:57:35.988 --> 01:57:39.789
and they're in confict
with themselves.


1639
01:57:39.858 --> 01:57:44.842
And it's a terribly diffcult
thing to have to go through.


1640
01:57:44.964 --> 01:57:47.058
I think you have to
be true to yourself.


1641
01:57:53.172 --> 01:57:57.303
My mother never said
I love you a lot.


1642
01:57:57.376 --> 01:58:03.407
But she'd show it when
you'd least expect it.


1643
01:58:03.515 --> 01:58:05.302
My mother and I are
sitting on the back terrace


1644
01:58:05.384 --> 01:58:08.354
having breakfast one
morning after church.


1645
01:58:08.420 --> 01:58:10.355
And she leaned over and kissed
me on the cheek and said,


1646
01:58:10.422 --> 01:58:13.017
I love you very much.

1647
01:58:13.092 --> 01:58:14.105
I was in a good place with her.

1648
01:58:14.226 --> 01:58:14.909
I know that.

1649
01:58:15.027 --> 01:58:18.862
And she was in a
good place with me.


1650
01:58:18.931 --> 01:58:19.853
I miss her.

1651
01:58:26.905 --> 01:58:31.525
There's something
well-grounded about Tab.


1652
01:58:31.610 --> 01:58:36.412
That's why he's lasted all
these years is that he's real.


1653
01:58:36.515 --> 01:58:37.198
He's like the earh.

1654
01:58:37.283 --> 01:58:40.071
He's solid.

1655
01:58:40.185 --> 01:58:44.680
He's happy in his own
special way to live his life,


1656
01:58:44.757 --> 01:58:47.181
and he's had a happy life.

1657
01:58:47.259 --> 01:58:49.023
He chose that right road.
