1
00:01:20.603 --> 00:01:22.039
Isn't it magical?

2
00:01:24.507 --> 00:01:26.710
Sure, Grama.

3
00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:28.212
Though I can't tell
if the bride's wearing


4
00:01:28.312 --> 00:01:30.513
little glass slippers or not.

5
00:01:30.613 --> 00:01:33.017
I bet they were
high school sweethearts.


6
00:01:33.117 --> 00:01:36.220
He proposed to her on a vacation
in Paris.


7
00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:39.357
The engagement ring rolled up
in a pair of his socks.


8
00:01:39.457 --> 00:01:40.724
She's gonna jump off that cake,

9
00:01:40.824 --> 00:01:43.227
and ride off on a pumpkin
any minute.


10
00:01:46.063 --> 00:01:48.865
Oh. Hmm.

11
00:01:48.966 --> 00:01:50.935
I've always loved this place.

12
00:01:51.035 --> 00:01:53.803
They do such wonderful
little weddings here.


13
00:01:53.904 --> 00:01:56.474
I remember when your dad
married your mom.


14
00:01:56.573 --> 00:01:58.175
He was so nervous.

15
00:01:58.275 --> 00:01:59.977
I had to tie his bow tie
for him.


16
00:02:03.347 --> 00:02:04.448
I guess that's one good thing

17
00:02:04.547 --> 00:02:06.516
about having a bum ticker
at my age.


18
00:02:06.616 --> 00:02:08.518
I'll be seeing them both soon.

19
00:02:08.618 --> 00:02:11.188
Grams, please don't talk
like that.


20
00:02:11.288 --> 00:02:14.291
Allan does take good care of me.

21
00:02:14.392 --> 00:02:15.759
He's probably back home,

22
00:02:15.859 --> 00:02:18.929
mixing up my dinner hour
medicinal cocktail right now.


23
00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:21.798
That should buy me
a few more hours.


24
00:02:21.899 --> 00:02:23.800
Save the dramatics
for your readers.


25
00:02:23.901 --> 00:02:26.870
I'd always imagined
I'd keel over at my typewriter.


26
00:02:26.971 --> 00:02:28.705
You still have a typewriter?

27
00:02:28.805 --> 00:02:31.208
Still, it isn't how you die.

28
00:02:31.308 --> 00:02:33.344
-It's how you live.
-Hmm.


29
00:02:33.444 --> 00:02:34.912
I'm proud of my writing.

30
00:02:35.012 --> 00:02:38.249
I'm glad I was able to bring
some happiness to some people.


31
00:02:38.349 --> 00:02:40.317
Even if were a little corny.

32
00:02:40.418 --> 00:02:41.485
Hey.

33
00:02:41.584 --> 00:02:43.320
You are still
Barmont publishing's


34
00:02:43.421 --> 00:02:44.355
number one author.

35
00:02:44.455 --> 00:02:46.823
And I'm most thankful for that.

36
00:02:46.924 --> 00:02:48.993
But I'm most proud
of my granddaughter.


37
00:02:50.194 --> 00:02:51.529
Honey.

38
00:02:51.628 --> 00:02:54.265
I know
it hasn't always been easy


39
00:02:54.365 --> 00:02:57.734
living with a substitute mom
who spent more time with


40
00:02:57.834 --> 00:03:00.271
imaginary heiresses
and farm hands,


41
00:03:00.371 --> 00:03:03.340
and less time at school plays
and birthday parties.


42
00:03:06.243 --> 00:03:09.746
With Mom and Dad gone,
you had to be a mom twice.


43
00:03:10.613 --> 00:03:11.549
Still.

44
00:03:14.085 --> 00:03:17.654
There is one thing
I'd like to see before I go.


45
00:03:17.754 --> 00:03:19.190
Okay, Grams. Come on.

46
00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:21.258
We are not having the marriage
discussion again, are we?


47
00:03:21.358 --> 00:03:23.294
It isn't about marriage.

48
00:03:23.394 --> 00:03:25.695
It's about your happiness.

49
00:03:25.795 --> 00:03:27.797
Whether you're married or not,

50
00:03:27.898 --> 00:03:31.035
I just wanna leave knowing
that you're with someone.


51
00:03:31.135 --> 00:03:32.970
I don't want to have
this conversation.


52
00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:34.305
Not now.

53
00:03:34.405 --> 00:03:36.507
You can't plot out my life
like one of your stories, Grama.


54
00:03:38.608 --> 00:03:40.677
Grams. Grama!

55
00:03:40.777 --> 00:03:42.313
Are you okay?

56
00:03:42.413 --> 00:03:43.414
-Pills.
-Pills!


57
00:03:46.683 --> 00:03:48.751
Here, here!

58
00:03:48.852 --> 00:03:51.021
I just want you to be happy.

59
00:03:51.122 --> 00:03:53.557
Grams, I'm happy!
Take your pill.


60
00:03:53.656 --> 00:03:54.691
With someone.

61
00:03:54.791 --> 00:03:57.461
I... I... I am. I have.

62
00:03:57.561 --> 00:03:59.096
Please. Your pill.

63
00:04:00.498 --> 00:04:02.032
I'm engaged.

64
00:04:08.339 --> 00:04:12.143
- Really?
- I was gonna surprise you today.


65
00:04:12.243 --> 00:04:13.310
I'm engaged.

66
00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:14.945
Does he make you happy?

67
00:04:15.812 --> 00:04:18.082
Yes, so happy.

68
00:04:18.182 --> 00:04:21.519
Mrs. Westmoreland.
Is everything all right?


69
00:04:21.619 --> 00:04:22.953
I think so.

70
00:04:23.053 --> 00:04:24.188
Grams?

71
00:04:26.957 --> 00:04:29.193
I think I'll just get her home.

72
00:04:39.769 --> 00:04:41.704
I'm so sorry.
I should have been there.


73
00:04:41.804 --> 00:04:44.108
No, no, no, no, Allan.
It was a girls' day out.


74
00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:47.777
- Mm.
- Mm-hmm.


75
00:04:47.877 --> 00:04:51.482
- All right, come on.
- Margaret Westmoreland.


76
00:04:51.582 --> 00:04:53.783
What are we going to do
with you?


77
00:04:56.353 --> 00:04:57.754
-You okay?
-Mm-hmm.


78
00:04:57.854 --> 00:04:59.856
You are grounded, young lady.

79
00:04:59.957 --> 00:05:03.227
I'm all right.
Really. I'm all right.


80
00:05:03.327 --> 00:05:05.728
- No, Allan.
- It's okay. I got her.


81
00:05:06.997 --> 00:05:08.999
I'll go steep the tea.

82
00:05:10.668 --> 00:05:12.802
Let's get you inside.

83
00:05:12.903 --> 00:05:14.138
Mm.

84
00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:29.553
Sweetheart, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry I upset you.


85
00:05:29.653 --> 00:05:31.788
Oh, Grams, no.
I'm... I'm sorry.


86
00:05:31.888 --> 00:05:32.957
I upset you,

87
00:05:33.057 --> 00:05:34.692
and you can't afford
to get upset.


88
00:05:34.791 --> 00:05:36.427
I'm all right now.

89
00:05:36.527 --> 00:05:38.128
Okay.

90
00:05:38.229 --> 00:05:39.396
I have to go.

91
00:05:39.496 --> 00:05:41.365
Wait. You're engaged?

92
00:05:42.499 --> 00:05:44.668
Yeah, Grams. I'm engaged.

93
00:05:44.767 --> 00:05:45.703
I'm happy for you.

94
00:05:45.802 --> 00:05:47.837
Me too. I'll talk to you soon.

95
00:05:47.938 --> 00:05:49.872
I want to meet him.

96
00:05:49.974 --> 00:05:53.177
I got it. See you, sweetie.

97
00:06:08.525 --> 00:06:10.928
Hey, Tray. Shall we get right
to the morning madness?


98
00:06:11.028 --> 00:06:12.463
First book is a new one
from Gardner.


99
00:06:12.563 --> 00:06:14.632
Sci-fi, historical fiction,
satire hybrid?


100
00:06:14.732 --> 00:06:15.933
- Good morning, Tracey.
- Yes.


101
00:06:16.033 --> 00:06:17.334
Carl wants you to fix
its identity crisis.


102
00:06:17.434 --> 00:06:18.936
Tracey? Tracey.

103
00:06:19.036 --> 00:06:20.437
Carl wanted me
to give this to you.


104
00:06:20.537 --> 00:06:21.672
Okay. Thank you, Connie.

105
00:06:21.771 --> 00:06:23.307
Next, is the Cartwell Saga.

106
00:06:23.407 --> 00:06:25.576
Carl wants you to turn
this epic into a novella.


107
00:06:25.676 --> 00:06:27.444
Take it to the chop shop,
and get the blow torch out.


108
00:06:27.544 --> 00:06:29.179
Hey. I'm just the one
who brings you the jalopies.


109
00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:30.748
You're the one
who makes them run.


110
00:06:30.847 --> 00:06:32.849
How's your grandmother?

111
00:06:32.950 --> 00:06:34.752
Yeah. They're still
not really sure.


112
00:06:34.851 --> 00:06:36.886
The doctors say
she's getting worse.


113
00:06:36.987 --> 00:06:39.490
Could be weeks, could be days.

114
00:06:39.590 --> 00:06:41.292
Oh, Tracey, I'm so sorry.

115
00:06:41.392 --> 00:06:42.660
Yeah.

116
00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:43.793
Though she did perk up
a little bit


117
00:06:43.894 --> 00:06:45.562
after pressing me
on my love life.


118
00:06:45.663 --> 00:06:46.563
Oh?

119
00:06:46.664 --> 00:06:48.632
No, nothing to tell. Just...

120
00:06:48.732 --> 00:06:49.799
A little white lie?

121
00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:52.002
-Yeah.
-Nothing wrong with that.


122
00:06:52.102 --> 00:06:53.604
Sometimes, telling people
what they wanna hear


123
00:06:53.704 --> 00:06:55.172
can be the best medicine.

124
00:06:55.272 --> 00:06:57.408
Yeah. Maybe.

125
00:06:57.508 --> 00:06:59.176
And tell her we all miss her.

126
00:06:59.276 --> 00:07:00.377
This place has been
pretty gloomy


127
00:07:00.477 --> 00:07:02.079
these last few months.

128
00:07:02.179 --> 00:07:02.879
Okay.

129
00:07:02.980 --> 00:07:04.081
Bring it in.

130
00:07:05.582 --> 00:07:07.051
Mm, thank you.

131
00:07:07.151 --> 00:07:08.952
My pleasure, my treasure.

132
00:07:11.689 --> 00:07:12.656
Yeah.

133
00:07:12.756 --> 00:07:14.024
Oh, I need a coffee.

134
00:07:30.574 --> 00:07:31.475
Okay.

135
00:07:33.110 --> 00:07:34.545
Tracey Westmoreland.

136
00:07:34.645 --> 00:07:36.280
<i>Tracey? It's Allan.</i>

137
00:07:36.380 --> 00:07:39.216
Allan? Oh, my God.
What's... what's happened?


138
00:07:39.316 --> 00:07:41.185
<i>Your grandmother made tea.</i>

139
00:07:42.152 --> 00:07:44.922
What? What do you mean?

140
00:07:45.022 --> 00:07:46.690
<i>The other day</i>
<i>when you came to visit,</i>


141
00:07:46.790 --> 00:07:48.192
<i>what did you talk about?</i>

142
00:07:49.793 --> 00:07:51.962
Oh, Allan, I'm sorry.

143
00:07:52.062 --> 00:07:53.863
We got on the marriage
discussion again.


144
00:07:53.964 --> 00:07:55.366
I think I may have upset her.

145
00:07:55.466 --> 00:07:57.468
<i>You may have just cured her.</i>

146
00:07:57.568 --> 00:08:00.971
Like I said, she walked
to the kitchen this morning.


147
00:08:01.071 --> 00:08:02.606
Completely unassisted?

148
00:08:02.706 --> 00:08:04.675
<i>And made tea for two!</i>

149
00:08:04.775 --> 00:08:07.010
<i>Wedge of lemon,</i>
<i>the good China.</i>


150
00:08:07.111 --> 00:08:08.812
<i>Oh, glorious!</i>

151
00:08:08.912 --> 00:08:10.414
<i>And the doctors were here.</i>

152
00:08:10.514 --> 00:08:12.549
<i>They say she's responding</i>
<i>to her medication much better.</i>


153
00:08:12.649 --> 00:08:15.753
You... you're kidding.
That's... that's great!


154
00:08:15.853 --> 00:08:18.255
<i>- Great?</i>
<i>- It's a full-on miracle!</i>


155
00:08:18.355 --> 00:08:21.392
<i>We are talkin' Holy Ghost power</i>
<i>over here.</i>


156
00:08:21.492 --> 00:08:23.994
<i>Then she told me</i>
<i>of another little miracle.</i>


157
00:08:24.094 --> 00:08:26.463
<i>She said she's going</i>
<i>to meet a man in your life?</i>


158
00:08:26.563 --> 00:08:28.232
<i>You know,</i>
<i>I'm not one to be morbid,</i>


159
00:08:28.332 --> 00:08:30.033
<i>but I think it's wonderful</i>

160
00:08:30.134 --> 00:08:31.568
<i>that you want</i>
<i>your grandmother's last days</i>


161
00:08:31.668 --> 00:08:34.037
<i>to be filled with joy</i>
<i>by having found joy yourself.</i>


162
00:08:34.138 --> 00:08:37.408
<i>Oh, you're an absolute angel!</i>

163
00:08:39.009 --> 00:08:41.478
<i>- You know, if I weren't married,</i>
<i>- I'd snap you up myself.</i>


164
00:08:41.578 --> 00:08:42.813
<i>Mm. But I guess Hector</i>

165
00:08:42.913 --> 00:08:44.615
<i>would have something to say</i>
<i>about that.</i>


166
00:08:44.715 --> 00:08:47.985
Thanks, Allan. I gotta go.

167
00:08:48.085 --> 00:08:49.653
Can you give my love to Grams?

168
00:08:49.753 --> 00:08:51.455
<i>I will. See you, sweetie!</i>

169
00:08:51.555 --> 00:08:52.689
See ya.

170
00:09:25.756 --> 00:09:26.657
You must be Tracey.

171
00:09:26.757 --> 00:09:28.592
Mm.

172
00:09:28.692 --> 00:09:30.027
Rob Humphries.

173
00:09:30.127 --> 00:09:32.796
You look exactly
like your picture.


174
00:09:32.897 --> 00:09:34.097
It's great to meet you.

175
00:09:34.198 --> 00:09:35.732
- Please.
- May I?


176
00:09:40.037 --> 00:09:40.771
Okay.

177
00:09:42.005 --> 00:09:45.375
So, uh,
tell me about the service.


178
00:09:45.476 --> 00:09:46.443
Right.

179
00:09:46.543 --> 00:09:49.079
Well, Rent-a-Groom deploys
folks like me


180
00:09:49.179 --> 00:09:51.348
for all kinds of circumstances.

181
00:09:51.448 --> 00:09:54.418
Jealous friends, creepy bosses,

182
00:09:54.518 --> 00:09:56.220
amorous coworkers.

183
00:09:56.320 --> 00:09:59.590
We can play boyfriends,
long-lost loves,


184
00:09:59.690 --> 00:10:02.359
right up to full-on fiancés.

185
00:10:02.459 --> 00:10:05.429
Once, I actually played
an overbearing older brother.


186
00:10:07.865 --> 00:10:08.967
Uh, Humphries.

187
00:10:09.066 --> 00:10:11.001
That's your...
that's your last name?


188
00:10:11.101 --> 00:10:12.503
Actually, it's a stage name.

189
00:10:12.603 --> 00:10:14.771
I'm a-
- I'm an actor.

190
00:10:14.872 --> 00:10:17.909
And a fan of Casablanca.

191
00:10:18.008 --> 00:10:20.110
I took the name from Bogey.

192
00:10:20.210 --> 00:10:22.346
-Humphrey.
-Bogart. I get it.


193
00:10:23.747 --> 00:10:26.316
Well, I hope you're a fan
of Raiders of the Lost Ark,


194
00:10:26.416 --> 00:10:28.619
because I'm changing your name
to Jones.


195
00:10:28.719 --> 00:10:31.321
Okay. Uh, great.

196
00:10:31.421 --> 00:10:33.490
Well, usually, the agency
supplies the back story,


197
00:10:33.590 --> 00:10:37.794
but I can see you have a very
thick folder there.


198
00:10:37.896 --> 00:10:38.963
Mister Humphries.

199
00:10:39.062 --> 00:10:40.397
Not Jones.

200
00:10:41.732 --> 00:10:43.066
Rob.

201
00:10:43.166 --> 00:10:45.569
I have created
a complete character profile


202
00:10:45.669 --> 00:10:48.705
including a modest job
at a junior accounting firm


203
00:10:48.805 --> 00:10:50.741
and a cabin in the mountains.

204
00:10:50.841 --> 00:10:52.209
May I?

205
00:10:55.914 --> 00:10:57.447
Wow.

206
00:10:58.715 --> 00:11:00.250
There are tabs if you...

207
00:11:04.087 --> 00:11:05.023
Rob Jones it is.

208
00:11:05.122 --> 00:11:06.456
I can live with that

209
00:11:06.557 --> 00:11:08.425
the few days
we'll be working together.


210
00:11:09.593 --> 00:11:11.728
Although, I don't expect you
to memorize everything.


211
00:11:11.828 --> 00:11:14.498
I'll be there, of course,
to keep you on track.


212
00:11:14.598 --> 00:11:18.002
I just--
I need attention to detail.


213
00:11:19.236 --> 00:11:21.772
Okay.
I mean, I love this stuff.


214
00:11:21.872 --> 00:11:23.340
Sounds like fun actually.

215
00:11:23.440 --> 00:11:26.410
Mr. Humphries-
- Uh, Mr. Jones.

216
00:11:26.510 --> 00:11:28.078
I wanna be clear with you.

217
00:11:28.178 --> 00:11:29.914
I need this
to go by the numbers,


218
00:11:30.014 --> 00:11:32.115
and in an expeditious manner.

219
00:11:33.017 --> 00:11:35.519
Right. Of course.

220
00:11:35.619 --> 00:11:36.955
Okay.

221
00:11:37.055 --> 00:11:39.256
Do you know
who Margaret Westmoreland is?


222
00:11:39.356 --> 00:11:40.424
The romance writer.

223
00:11:40.524 --> 00:11:44.361
The Cassandra Robards series.

224
00:11:44.461 --> 00:11:46.597
My mom used to read those
when I was a kid.


225
00:11:46.697 --> 00:11:47.764
She loved them.

226
00:11:47.864 --> 00:11:48.765
Hmm.

227
00:11:49.901 --> 00:11:53.604
Ah. Wait. Westmoreland.

228
00:11:53.704 --> 00:11:55.172
Are you related to her?

229
00:11:55.272 --> 00:11:57.075
She is my grandmother, yes.

230
00:11:57.174 --> 00:11:58.342
You kidding me?

231
00:11:58.442 --> 00:12:01.311
- No.
- Wow. Wow. Your grandmother.


232
00:12:01.411 --> 00:12:02.846
Yes.

233
00:12:02.947 --> 00:12:06.617
She is, um...
she's very ill.


234
00:12:06.717 --> 00:12:10.520
Oh, gosh. I'm...
so sorry to hear that.


235
00:12:10.621 --> 00:12:12.356
My parents died
when I was very young.


236
00:12:12.456 --> 00:12:14.658
And Maggie raised me by herself.

237
00:12:14.758 --> 00:12:17.260
Sounds like a--
like an incredible lady.


238
00:12:19.964 --> 00:12:22.299
Well, ever since
I was a little girl,


239
00:12:22.399 --> 00:12:25.302
she one day dreamed
of walking me down the aisle


240
00:12:25.402 --> 00:12:26.803
to marry Mr. Right.

241
00:12:28.138 --> 00:12:29.873
This is Mr. Right.

242
00:12:29.974 --> 00:12:31.109
-Oh.
-With her illness,


243
00:12:31.208 --> 00:12:33.243
she won't be there
for the wedding day.


244
00:12:33.343 --> 00:12:35.412
This is about a couple of weeks
of joy.


245
00:12:36.680 --> 00:12:39.650
She needs to believe completely
in this engagement.


246
00:12:39.750 --> 00:12:41.652
Absolutely.

247
00:12:41.752 --> 00:12:44.221
I assure you,
I will not let you down.


248
00:12:46.057 --> 00:12:48.191
So, when do we start?

249
00:12:48.291 --> 00:12:50.028
Tomorrow...

250
00:12:50.128 --> 00:12:51.695
at my grandmother's house.

251
00:12:58.635 --> 00:12:59.870
Yep?

252
00:12:59.971 --> 00:13:03.440
How is Barmont Publishing's
greatest fixer this morning?


253
00:13:03.540 --> 00:13:06.376
You know, got my head
under the hood of another one.


254
00:13:06.476 --> 00:13:08.112
Ah, well, that's the problem

255
00:13:08.211 --> 00:13:09.914
when you're the best
at something.


256
00:13:10.014 --> 00:13:11.181
You get stuck there.

257
00:13:11.281 --> 00:13:12.917
- Believe me, I know.
- Mm.


258
00:13:13.017 --> 00:13:13.884
Sounds like
you could use a break.


259
00:13:13.985 --> 00:13:15.419
Let me take you to lunch.

260
00:13:15.519 --> 00:13:18.022
I'm afraid it's leftovers
at the desk for me again today.


261
00:13:18.122 --> 00:13:19.623
Mm. Dinner it is then.

262
00:13:19.723 --> 00:13:23.193
In fact, I think it's about time
we popped the cord on that Dom.


263
00:13:23.293 --> 00:13:25.829
I got a good feeling
about this sci-fi series.


264
00:13:25.930 --> 00:13:27.131
I can't.

265
00:13:27.230 --> 00:13:28.732
Hey. Listen.

266
00:13:30.101 --> 00:13:31.435
It was one date.

267
00:13:31.535 --> 00:13:33.336
-It was a mistake.
-I had a great time.


268
00:13:33.437 --> 00:13:35.073
It's not what I mean, Todd.

269
00:13:35.173 --> 00:13:36.908
-We work together.
-I agree.


270
00:13:37.008 --> 00:13:38.608
We work very well together
in fact.


271
00:13:38.709 --> 00:13:39.676
Exactly.

272
00:13:39.776 --> 00:13:41.179
And I would like to keep it
that way.


273
00:13:41.278 --> 00:13:43.147
One drink. Call it a do-over.

274
00:13:43.246 --> 00:13:45.582
I'm going to my grandmother's
house tonight.


275
00:13:45.682 --> 00:13:47.085
Right.

276
00:13:47.185 --> 00:13:47.884
Of course.

277
00:13:49.120 --> 00:13:50.854
How is Maggie doing?

278
00:13:50.955 --> 00:13:52.389
Better surprisingly.

279
00:13:52.489 --> 00:13:54.591
Mm. Mm-hmm.
That is good to hear.


280
00:13:54.691 --> 00:13:56.226
Good to hear.

281
00:13:56.326 --> 00:13:58.963
Amazing to think
that this whole company


282
00:13:59.063 --> 00:14:01.865
started with her first
Cassandra novel 30 years ago.


283
00:14:01.966 --> 00:14:03.000
Thirty-one actually.

284
00:14:03.101 --> 00:14:04.234
Yep.

285
00:14:04.334 --> 00:14:05.535
Everything's gonna change
around here


286
00:14:05.635 --> 00:14:08.206
once I get
the editor-in-chief position.


287
00:14:08.305 --> 00:14:10.340
Hey, but don't worry.

288
00:14:10.440 --> 00:14:13.077
Nothing's gonna change
between you and I.


289
00:14:13.177 --> 00:14:14.745
I need Barmont's best fixer
on my team.


290
00:14:16.279 --> 00:14:18.482
Mm. Okay.

291
00:14:19.984 --> 00:14:21.418
All right. Well...

292
00:14:21.518 --> 00:14:23.054
...back to makin' millions.

293
00:14:23.154 --> 00:14:24.021
Just kidding.

294
00:14:24.122 --> 00:14:25.355
I do pretty well, though.

295
00:14:25.455 --> 00:14:28.759
And, uh... give your grandmother
my best, okay?


296
00:14:28.859 --> 00:14:29.894
You got it.

297
00:14:33.530 --> 00:14:34.664
Can you close my door, Todd,
please? Todd--


298
00:14:34.765 --> 00:14:36.934
Janice! How the heck are ya?

299
00:14:46.077 --> 00:14:48.512
Okay. Thank you.

300
00:14:49.846 --> 00:14:51.314
Are you ready?

301
00:14:51.414 --> 00:14:53.017
-Ready.
-Okay.


302
00:14:58.421 --> 00:14:59.924
Right. Engaged.

303
00:15:05.862 --> 00:15:06.863
Sweetie!

304
00:15:06.964 --> 00:15:08.465
Hi, Allan.

305
00:15:08.565 --> 00:15:10.101
Good evening. I'm...

306
00:15:10.201 --> 00:15:12.036
An absolute dream boat.

307
00:15:13.037 --> 00:15:14.638
Get in here.

308
00:15:14.738 --> 00:15:15.438
Welcome.

309
00:15:15.539 --> 00:15:16.274
Thank you, Allan.

310
00:15:16.373 --> 00:15:17.574
Thank you.

311
00:15:18.875 --> 00:15:21.179
Make yourselves comfortable.

312
00:15:21.279 --> 00:15:23.880
I'll just be in the kitchen
eavesdropping.


313
00:15:35.492 --> 00:15:37.427
Cassandra Robards.

314
00:15:37.527 --> 00:15:39.931
Appointment with Destiny.

315
00:15:40.031 --> 00:15:41.765
Grams.

316
00:15:41.865 --> 00:15:44.001
It was my mom's favorite
in the series.


317
00:15:44.101 --> 00:15:45.735
Mine, too!

318
00:15:45.836 --> 00:15:49.372
I had all the framed covers
at the old house.


319
00:15:49.472 --> 00:15:52.609
But it seemed a little vain
to put up 20 books.


320
00:15:52.709 --> 00:15:53.810
I figured one would do.

321
00:15:53.911 --> 00:15:55.345
It's a good one.

322
00:15:56.613 --> 00:15:58.216
Oh!

323
00:16:01.751 --> 00:16:04.288
It's so nice
to finally meet you, Rob.


324
00:16:04.387 --> 00:16:06.190
It's an honor to meet you, Mrs--

325
00:16:06.290 --> 00:16:09.260
Maggie. Call me Maggie.

326
00:16:09.359 --> 00:16:10.627
Maggie.

327
00:16:13.898 --> 00:16:15.432
Hi.

328
00:16:15.532 --> 00:16:18.568
Grams, I mean... you look great!

329
00:16:18.668 --> 00:16:21.105
I feel pretty great, too, kiddo.

330
00:16:22.173 --> 00:16:23.640
This way.

331
00:16:34.151 --> 00:16:36.453
Tea, anyone?

332
00:16:36.553 --> 00:16:38.022
Thank you, Allen.

333
00:16:38.122 --> 00:16:39.522
Of course.

334
00:16:42.193 --> 00:16:44.161
Don't forget your little pair
of teeth, my sweet.


335
00:16:44.262 --> 00:16:45.595
Mm-hmm.

336
00:16:47.064 --> 00:16:48.832
Cheers.

337
00:16:48.933 --> 00:16:49.934
I'll be upstairs,

338
00:16:50.034 --> 00:16:51.835
watching my little murder shows
for a while.


339
00:16:53.204 --> 00:16:55.139
You kids have fun.

340
00:17:00.378 --> 00:17:01.379
I hope you like Earl Grey.

341
00:17:01.478 --> 00:17:03.446
Mm-mm! My favorite.

342
00:17:06.217 --> 00:17:07.684
Help yourself to the strudel.

343
00:17:07.784 --> 00:17:09.921
I baked it fresh this afternoon.

344
00:17:10.021 --> 00:17:11.421
You baked strudel?

345
00:17:12.422 --> 00:17:13.757
Of course.

346
00:17:13.857 --> 00:17:14.992
That's funny.

347
00:17:15.092 --> 00:17:17.128
I don't remember
so much as a single cupcake


348
00:17:17.228 --> 00:17:18.930
on any one of my birthdays.

349
00:17:19.030 --> 00:17:19.763
Thank you.

350
00:17:19.863 --> 00:17:21.399
I pulled it out of the archives.

351
00:17:21.498 --> 00:17:23.833
I found this wonderful,
old Austrian recipe


352
00:17:23.935 --> 00:17:24.969
for pear strudel

353
00:17:25.069 --> 00:17:27.338
when I was doing research
for book four.


354
00:17:27.437 --> 00:17:29.173
One Vienna Summer.

355
00:17:29.273 --> 00:17:31.441
Yes. You read it.

356
00:17:31.541 --> 00:17:33.610
Well, over my mom's shoulder.

357
00:17:33.710 --> 00:17:37.348
Impeccable taste, both of you.

358
00:17:37.447 --> 00:17:38.481
So, your folks,

359
00:17:38.581 --> 00:17:39.749
they'll be coming
to the wedding?


360
00:17:41.018 --> 00:17:42.987
My mom has passed.

361
00:17:43.087 --> 00:17:45.990
And my dad, well,
he's not really in the picture.


362
00:17:46.090 --> 00:17:48.491
I'm sorry to hear
about your mother.


363
00:17:48.591 --> 00:17:51.028
I understand
what that kind of loss means.


364
00:17:52.562 --> 00:17:54.265
Thank you.

365
00:17:54.365 --> 00:17:56.167
I know she would
have loved Tracey.


366
00:17:57.600 --> 00:17:59.636
And she would've been thrilled
to be in-laws


367
00:17:59.736 --> 00:18:01.471
with the great
Margaret Westmoreland.


368
00:18:03.807 --> 00:18:07.178
Charming fellow.
Wherever did you find him?


369
00:18:07.278 --> 00:18:09.813
Well, Rob's accounting firm
does some consulting


370
00:18:09.914 --> 00:18:11.815
for the publishing company.

371
00:18:13.017 --> 00:18:14.452
Hmm.

372
00:18:14.551 --> 00:18:17.989
One day, we just kind of fell
into each other's arms.


373
00:18:21.125 --> 00:18:23.361
Fell? More like crashed.

374
00:18:24.929 --> 00:18:27.331
The ski hill didn't look
quite so steep from the bottom.


375
00:18:27.431 --> 00:18:28.798
- Ski hill?
- Hmm.


376
00:18:28.899 --> 00:18:30.600
When did you take up skiing?

377
00:18:30.700 --> 00:18:31.936
I--

378
00:18:32.036 --> 00:18:35.538
Whitefish. March.
A beautiful time of year.


379
00:18:35.638 --> 00:18:38.275
You know, I think
it was the early morning glare


380
00:18:38.376 --> 00:18:40.311
off the white mountain caps.

381
00:18:40.411 --> 00:18:41.445
First run of the day.

382
00:18:41.544 --> 00:18:42.913
Pristine powder.

383
00:18:43.014 --> 00:18:45.016
Nothing but the sound
of the wind through the trees.


384
00:18:45.116 --> 00:18:45.782
Just...

385
00:18:47.684 --> 00:18:49.220
Oh, my goodness.

386
00:18:49.320 --> 00:18:51.255
I was racing down the mountain.

387
00:18:51.355 --> 00:18:52.822
The Arctic chill at my back.

388
00:18:52.923 --> 00:18:56.160
And nothing but virgin snow
before me.


389
00:18:56.260 --> 00:18:58.528
As I rounded a bend, a...

390
00:18:58.628 --> 00:19:01.598
a mother deer and her fawn.

391
00:19:01.698 --> 00:19:04.534
I swerved to avoid them,
and then I was in the trees.


392
00:19:04.634 --> 00:19:08.605
Miraculously,
I survived the Alpine chaos,


393
00:19:09.773 --> 00:19:12.443
just to run straight into a pack
of spring break skiers.


394
00:19:12.542 --> 00:19:15.779
I'm a ball of bindings
and goggles.


395
00:19:15.879 --> 00:19:17.580
And when I finally came to rest,

396
00:19:17.680 --> 00:19:19.649
I looked up, and I...

397
00:19:21.318 --> 00:19:22.752
I saw an angel.

398
00:19:24.754 --> 00:19:27.491
Oh, my goodness. Tracey!

399
00:19:27.590 --> 00:19:30.127
Why didn't you tell me
about this?


400
00:19:31.628 --> 00:19:34.098
It was just a work thing,
you know?


401
00:19:35.499 --> 00:19:36.766
-Team building.
-Mm.


402
00:19:36.866 --> 00:19:38.002
Hmm.

403
00:19:38.102 --> 00:19:40.337
- Hmm.
- So, she rescued you?


404
00:19:43.074 --> 00:19:44.241
It's perfect.

405
00:19:44.341 --> 00:19:45.742
-Yes.
-Perfect.


406
00:19:48.678 --> 00:19:52.483
The, uh... the, uh,
consulting came later.


407
00:19:52.582 --> 00:19:53.984
You don't speak
like an accountant.


408
00:19:55.119 --> 00:19:56.320
Hmm.

409
00:19:56.420 --> 00:19:58.923
I'm gonna refill the teapot.

410
00:19:59.023 --> 00:20:00.424
Rob...

411
00:20:00.524 --> 00:20:04.128
darling, how about a tour
of the kitchen?


412
00:20:04.228 --> 00:20:05.496
Of course, my love.

413
00:20:06.629 --> 00:20:08.865
Let's go right now.

414
00:20:11.402 --> 00:20:12.702
What on earth are you doing?

415
00:20:12.802 --> 00:20:14.972
Oh, just a little improvising.

416
00:20:15.072 --> 00:20:16.273
Improvising?

417
00:20:16.373 --> 00:20:17.841
Oh, come on, Tracey.

418
00:20:17.942 --> 00:20:19.243
This is Margaret Westmoreland.

419
00:20:19.343 --> 00:20:21.512
She doesn't want tax returns
and office parties.


420
00:20:21.611 --> 00:20:23.948
Okay. Listen, Rob.

421
00:20:25.049 --> 00:20:26.984
I'm not paying you
to be James Bond,


422
00:20:27.084 --> 00:20:29.386
or Heathcliff,
or the king of Siam.


423
00:20:29.487 --> 00:20:32.389
I'm paying you
to be Robert Jones,


424
00:20:32.490 --> 00:20:34.824
accountant, and my fiancé.

425
00:20:34.925 --> 00:20:37.328
If you could just stick
to the script for the next hour,


426
00:20:37.428 --> 00:20:38.529
we can wrap this up,

427
00:20:38.628 --> 00:20:40.965
and both get back
to our own lives.


428
00:20:41.065 --> 00:20:41.798
Okay?

429
00:20:41.899 --> 00:20:44.602
Understood. I apologize.

430
00:20:44.701 --> 00:20:46.270
It won't happen again.

431
00:20:46.370 --> 00:20:47.371
Okay.

432
00:20:48.472 --> 00:20:49.873
Thank you.

433
00:20:57.814 --> 00:21:00.951
"Young man,
you're simply too short."


434
00:21:01.051 --> 00:21:02.553
He pops
on the casting director's


435
00:21:02.652 --> 00:21:05.222
high heel shoes,
turns to me, and said,


436
00:21:05.322 --> 00:21:06.423
"How do you like me now?"

437
00:21:10.094 --> 00:21:11.929
Unbelievable!

438
00:21:12.029 --> 00:21:14.431
I didn't realize
you had a say in casting.


439
00:21:15.732 --> 00:21:17.101
How many of your books
did they adapt?


440
00:21:17.201 --> 00:21:20.703
Oh, I don't know.
A dozen, I think.


441
00:21:20.803 --> 00:21:22.739
Simply amazing.

442
00:21:22.839 --> 00:21:25.476
Well, we could listen
to Grama's old Hollywood stories


443
00:21:25.576 --> 00:21:27.311
all night long, but...

444
00:21:28.811 --> 00:21:30.381
we should probably let you
get some rest.


445
00:21:30.481 --> 00:21:31.949
Nonsense!

446
00:21:32.049 --> 00:21:34.151
I was thinking of putting
some music on.


447
00:21:34.251 --> 00:21:36.987
Perhaps finding out if this
young man knows how to tango.


448
00:21:37.087 --> 00:21:38.821
Mm.

449
00:21:42.560 --> 00:21:44.261
Tracey's probably right.

450
00:21:44.361 --> 00:21:45.695
I got two left feet anyway.

451
00:21:47.364 --> 00:21:49.233
Happy wife, happy life, huh?

452
00:21:49.333 --> 00:21:50.367
Indeed.

453
00:21:51.701 --> 00:21:54.371
Well, I can certainly see that.

454
00:21:54.471 --> 00:21:55.772
I may not be here for the day--

455
00:21:55.872 --> 00:21:57.441
Grams, come on.

456
00:21:58.741 --> 00:22:01.946
But I will rest easy,
knowing she's happy.


457
00:22:04.114 --> 00:22:05.715
- Thank you.
- Thank you.


458
00:22:05.815 --> 00:22:07.251
- Goodbye, darling.
- Mm.


459
00:22:07.784 --> 00:22:08.919
Okay.

460
00:22:09.019 --> 00:22:10.287
I'll talk to you tomorrow,
Grams, okay?


461
00:22:10.387 --> 00:22:11.888
Okay.

462
00:22:18.562 --> 00:22:19.597
Someone's birthday?

463
00:22:26.403 --> 00:22:27.972
Oh, no.

464
00:22:32.176 --> 00:22:34.678
I didn't think
you were the marrying type.


465
00:22:34.777 --> 00:22:36.113
Carl. Well--

466
00:22:36.213 --> 00:22:38.881
Oh, I can't wait to meet him
at the engagement party.


467
00:22:38.983 --> 00:22:40.317
Engagement party?

468
00:22:40.417 --> 00:22:41.652
- Yeah.
- What?


469
00:22:41.751 --> 00:22:43.153
Who said anything
about an engagement party?


470
00:22:43.254 --> 00:22:45.456
Your grandmother.
Yeah, she called me last night.


471
00:22:45.556 --> 00:22:46.724
Maggie called you?

472
00:22:46.823 --> 00:22:48.125
Yeah. She told me everything.

473
00:22:48.225 --> 00:22:51.061
I just think
it's wonderful, Tracey!


474
00:22:51.161 --> 00:22:54.131
I haven't heard her
that happy in...


475
00:22:54.965 --> 00:22:56.300
...years.

476
00:22:56.400 --> 00:22:58.801
I, for one, think
this is great news.


477
00:22:58.902 --> 00:23:01.804
It's like the whole office
is ecstatic.


478
00:23:01.905 --> 00:23:04.742
Oh. It's exactly
what we all needed.


479
00:23:04.841 --> 00:23:07.478
Just to see Maggie again.

480
00:23:07.578 --> 00:23:09.779
Oh! Oh!

481
00:23:09.879 --> 00:23:11.515
You couldn't have planned it
any better.


482
00:23:14.952 --> 00:23:16.186
Hey, girlfriend.

483
00:23:16.287 --> 00:23:17.454
How come your best friend
is the last person


484
00:23:17.554 --> 00:23:19.056
to hear about all this? Hmm?

485
00:23:19.156 --> 00:23:19.889
Come here.

486
00:23:19.990 --> 00:23:20.823
Who's question mark?

487
00:23:20.924 --> 00:23:22.226
Get in here!

488
00:23:23.894 --> 00:23:25.329
Ouch.

489
00:23:27.698 --> 00:23:29.233
Okay. I'm not engaged.

490
00:23:29.333 --> 00:23:30.467
What?
What are you talking about?


491
00:23:30.567 --> 00:23:31.435
It's all over the office.

492
00:23:31.535 --> 00:23:32.469
I hired a guy.

493
00:23:32.569 --> 00:23:33.537
Okay, what?

494
00:23:33.637 --> 00:23:35.005
No, no. Not like that.

495
00:23:37.141 --> 00:23:38.609
My grandmother is dying.

496
00:23:38.709 --> 00:23:39.743
Don't say that!

497
00:23:39.842 --> 00:23:40.944
It's the truth, Shelley.

498
00:23:41.045 --> 00:23:42.346
I went to go see her last week.

499
00:23:42.446 --> 00:23:44.081
We got on the marriage argument
again.


500
00:23:44.181 --> 00:23:46.250
She just about keeled over
right there.


501
00:23:46.350 --> 00:23:49.353
I panicked, and I blurted out
that I'm engaged.


502
00:23:49.453 --> 00:23:50.921
You lied to your grandmother?

503
00:23:51.021 --> 00:23:52.323
I tried to tell you.

504
00:23:52.423 --> 00:23:53.991
And you said all that stuff
about white lies


505
00:23:54.091 --> 00:23:55.259
and good medicine.

506
00:23:55.359 --> 00:23:56.727
Well, that's a little more
grey than white.


507
00:23:56.826 --> 00:23:59.263
Yeah. Well, then she wanted
to meet him.


508
00:23:59.363 --> 00:24:01.899
So, I called
this rent-a-groom place.


509
00:24:01.999 --> 00:24:03.033
Rent a groom?

510
00:24:03.133 --> 00:24:04.902
I'll explain later.
But just...


511
00:24:05.002 --> 00:24:06.804
you can't tell anyone.

512
00:24:06.904 --> 00:24:07.938
Please, Shelley--

513
00:24:08.038 --> 00:24:09.540
Okay, okay. I get it.

514
00:24:09.640 --> 00:24:10.741
Okay, look.

515
00:24:10.840 --> 00:24:12.543
As far as this office
is concerned,


516
00:24:12.643 --> 00:24:14.445
this engagement is real.

517
00:24:14.545 --> 00:24:15.579
All right.

518
00:24:15.679 --> 00:24:17.247
I'll play along
for Maggie's sake.


519
00:24:17.348 --> 00:24:18.782
I just hope you know
what you're doing.


520
00:24:18.881 --> 00:24:20.250
So do I.

521
00:24:20.351 --> 00:24:23.020
So, is he cute?

522
00:24:23.120 --> 00:24:25.522
<i>♪ I'm going through changes ♪</i>

523
00:24:27.024 --> 00:24:28.625
<i>♪ It's going faster... ♪</i>

524
00:24:28.726 --> 00:24:29.793
I'm sorry.

525
00:24:29.893 --> 00:24:31.261
I'm sure
this will be the last time.


526
00:24:31.362 --> 00:24:34.164
I just--
I need you there tonight.


527
00:24:35.666 --> 00:24:37.468
-Thanks.
-Thank you.


528
00:24:38.602 --> 00:24:40.270
The whole office?

529
00:24:40.371 --> 00:24:42.139
So, we have a full house
tonight.


530
00:24:42.239 --> 00:24:44.441
It's just a quick, little thing
at a restaurant.


531
00:24:44.541 --> 00:24:45.776
Ah, Dinner Theatre.

532
00:24:45.875 --> 00:24:47.444
The blue rinse crowd.
Try the buffet. Got it.


533
00:24:48.278 --> 00:24:50.547
I need you
on your best behavior.


534
00:24:50.647 --> 00:24:52.583
No improv, right?

535
00:24:52.683 --> 00:24:54.351
Tax returns all the way.

536
00:24:55.519 --> 00:24:56.754
Okay.

537
00:24:56.854 --> 00:24:59.523
So, tonight, eight o'clock,
Hollingsworth's.


538
00:25:00.624 --> 00:25:02.826
Um, no. No.

539
00:25:02.926 --> 00:25:04.695
So, we... we...
we can't go there.


540
00:25:04.795 --> 00:25:05.863
I used to work there.

541
00:25:05.963 --> 00:25:07.898
It's her favorite place.

542
00:25:07.998 --> 00:25:09.266
Well, someone will recognize me.

543
00:25:09.366 --> 00:25:11.368
It'll blow my cover for sure.

544
00:25:12.503 --> 00:25:13.670
You're that famous, huh?

545
00:25:16.473 --> 00:25:19.109
There's this great little
French bistro, Annabelle's,


546
00:25:19.209 --> 00:25:20.744
over on the East Side.

547
00:25:20.844 --> 00:25:23.347
Tell her
it was our first date place.


548
00:25:23.447 --> 00:25:24.415
She'll love it.

549
00:25:24.515 --> 00:25:26.617
You are creative.
I will give you that.


550
00:25:26.717 --> 00:25:28.652
Just a little improvising.

551
00:25:32.156 --> 00:25:34.425
All right.
I'll make the arrangements.


552
00:25:34.525 --> 00:25:36.827
Just make sure
you pick me up on time.


553
00:25:36.927 --> 00:25:39.296
Haven't missed
a curtain call yet.


554
00:25:52.709 --> 00:25:53.977
You look lovely.

555
00:25:54.077 --> 00:25:55.479
Thank you.

556
00:25:55.579 --> 00:25:57.448
You look lovely, too.

557
00:25:57.548 --> 00:25:58.882
A lovely couple then.

558
00:25:58.982 --> 00:26:00.517
Well, gotta look the part,
right?


559
00:26:05.556 --> 00:26:07.891
Like you said,
"Gotta look the part, right?"


560
00:26:11.028 --> 00:26:13.964
It's on loan from a...
a good friend.


561
00:26:14.998 --> 00:26:15.799
I get it.

562
00:26:15.900 --> 00:26:17.902
It's a... it's a prop.

563
00:26:18.001 --> 00:26:19.002
Yeah, yeah.

564
00:26:19.102 --> 00:26:21.472
Something like that.
Try it on.


565
00:26:25.209 --> 00:26:27.511
There. Now, we both
have our motivation


566
00:26:27.611 --> 00:26:28.612
for the next scene.

567
00:26:37.922 --> 00:26:39.156
Thank you.

568
00:26:48.967 --> 00:26:49.766
I'm so excited.

569
00:26:49.867 --> 00:26:50.969
Oh, really?

570
00:26:51.068 --> 00:26:52.002
There they are.

571
00:26:55.339 --> 00:26:57.174
You look breathtaking!

572
00:26:58.509 --> 00:27:00.244
She's all yours.

573
00:27:04.047 --> 00:27:05.182
Um, Grams.

574
00:27:05.282 --> 00:27:06.951
Where did this new wardrobe
come from?


575
00:27:07.050 --> 00:27:08.552
This old frock?

576
00:27:08.652 --> 00:27:11.255
I wore it to my last
book signing in New York.


577
00:27:11.355 --> 00:27:12.856
I'm pulling out all the stops.

578
00:27:12.957 --> 00:27:14.525
Maggie, you look heavenly.

579
00:27:14.625 --> 00:27:15.492
Aw.

580
00:27:15.592 --> 00:27:19.062
Speaking of,
this Annabelle gal...


581
00:27:19.162 --> 00:27:20.864
I'm sorry
about the last-minute switch.


582
00:27:20.965 --> 00:27:22.199
Oh, not at all.

583
00:27:22.299 --> 00:27:24.801
I've been going
to Hollingsworth's for years.


584
00:27:24.903 --> 00:27:27.939
And this place,
talk about enchanted.


585
00:27:28.038 --> 00:27:29.908
Wherever did you find it?

586
00:27:30.008 --> 00:27:31.241
Sometimes, you just stumble
upon something,


587
00:27:31.341 --> 00:27:33.210
and you... you fall in love.

588
00:27:40.551 --> 00:27:43.220
Well, if the house sparkling
is any indication,


589
00:27:43.320 --> 00:27:44.521
it's love at first sight.

590
00:27:53.196 --> 00:27:54.064
Such a gentleman.

591
00:27:57.234 --> 00:27:58.937
This is lovely.

592
00:28:04.474 --> 00:28:05.910
Oh, here, let me.

593
00:28:06.010 --> 00:28:07.444
Just two red wines, please.

594
00:28:09.513 --> 00:28:10.147
Uh, thank you.

595
00:28:10.247 --> 00:28:12.449
-Maggie.
-Thank you.


596
00:28:14.851 --> 00:28:17.254
Yes, yes, yes.

597
00:28:22.392 --> 00:28:24.094
Ladies and gentlemen.

598
00:28:25.162 --> 00:28:28.565
It gives me great pleasure
to introduce to you


599
00:28:28.665 --> 00:28:33.037
my granddaughter Tracey
and her fiancé Rob.


600
00:28:40.310 --> 00:28:43.547
I've written many stories
in my time.


601
00:28:43.647 --> 00:28:46.850
And I've sent many characters
on wile adventures,


602
00:28:46.951 --> 00:28:48.619
looking for love.

603
00:28:48.719 --> 00:28:51.923
But it's often when we stop
searching for something


604
00:28:52.023 --> 00:28:53.857
that we find it.

605
00:28:53.958 --> 00:28:55.759
So, I'd like to propose a toast.

606
00:29:00.197 --> 00:29:02.666
To letting love find you.

607
00:29:08.305 --> 00:29:09.640
-Here.
-Thank you.


608
00:29:09.740 --> 00:29:11.208
I think you could use a drink.

609
00:29:11.308 --> 00:29:12.776
Yeah.

610
00:29:12.876 --> 00:29:15.145
The mystery man at last.

611
00:29:15.245 --> 00:29:18.582
Shelley.
This is my fiancé, Rob.


612
00:29:18.682 --> 00:29:20.450
Rob, this is my best friend,
Shelley.


613
00:29:20.550 --> 00:29:21.852
The one with the big mouth.

614
00:29:21.953 --> 00:29:23.754
I've heard all about you.

615
00:29:23.854 --> 00:29:26.623
I didn't know accountants
were so good-looking.


616
00:29:26.723 --> 00:29:28.926
Uh, Shelley, dear.

617
00:29:29.027 --> 00:29:30.227
I don't think
this fine restaurant


618
00:29:30.327 --> 00:29:32.796
wants to be the scene
of a murder tonight.


619
00:29:32.897 --> 00:29:33.764
Oh, my good God!

620
00:29:33.864 --> 00:29:34.665
What?

621
00:29:34.765 --> 00:29:35.799
This ring.

622
00:29:35.900 --> 00:29:37.734
It's enough to make a girl weak
in the knees.


623
00:29:37.834 --> 00:29:38.970
It's just a prop.

624
00:29:39.070 --> 00:29:40.437
It could've fooled me.

625
00:29:40.537 --> 00:29:43.407
Yes. Well, maybe you should go
rest your weak knees.


626
00:29:43.507 --> 00:29:45.208
Keep your mouth shut, okay?

627
00:29:45.308 --> 00:29:48.311
Don't worry about me.
I'll keep my mouth shut.


628
00:29:49.579 --> 00:29:52.649
Listen, are you available
the next couple of weeks?


629
00:29:52.749 --> 00:29:55.686
I have this ex-boyfriend
I wanna drive crazy--


630
00:29:55.786 --> 00:29:56.853
Shelley!

631
00:29:58.522 --> 00:30:00.058
Okay.

632
00:30:00.158 --> 00:30:00.992
Hi!

633
00:30:01.092 --> 00:30:02.026
Hey, Shelley.

634
00:30:02.126 --> 00:30:02.960
They invited you.

635
00:30:03.061 --> 00:30:04.062
What was that about?

636
00:30:04.162 --> 00:30:05.429
She knows.

637
00:30:05.529 --> 00:30:08.099
Knows what?

638
00:30:08.198 --> 00:30:10.101
Tracey, you look...

639
00:30:10.200 --> 00:30:11.501
...delicious.

640
00:30:11.601 --> 00:30:14.906
-Okay.
-Todd. This is my fiancé, Rob.


641
00:30:16.174 --> 00:30:17.108
Rob.

642
00:30:17.207 --> 00:30:18.809
Mm.

643
00:30:20.277 --> 00:30:23.246
It is truly an honor
to meet the man


644
00:30:23.346 --> 00:30:25.083
who, uh, melted
the ice queen's heart.


645
00:30:26.650 --> 00:30:27.884
So, seriously, how'd you do it?

646
00:30:27.985 --> 00:30:29.519
No, no. Let me guess.

647
00:30:29.619 --> 00:30:32.589
You're a crown prince,
heir to the throne of Moravia,


648
00:30:32.689 --> 00:30:35.325
and, uh,
gave it all up for love.


649
00:30:35.425 --> 00:30:36.894
No. Afraid not.

650
00:30:36.994 --> 00:30:37.794
Oh, well, I got it.

651
00:30:37.895 --> 00:30:39.796
You are a secret agent,

652
00:30:39.897 --> 00:30:42.399
masquerading
as an international playboy.


653
00:30:42.499 --> 00:30:44.936
You're hiding here until
the heat blows over, and


654
00:30:45.036 --> 00:30:46.170
Tracey here is your cover.

655
00:30:47.871 --> 00:30:50.874
That sounds a lot like the plot
to my third novel, Todd.


656
00:30:52.409 --> 00:30:54.145
You wanna be careful
I don't sue you for plagiarism.


657
00:30:54.277 --> 00:30:56.214
Oh, Maggie.

658
00:30:56.313 --> 00:30:58.548
May I just say on behalf
of the entire


659
00:30:58.648 --> 00:31:01.585
Barmont Publishing family
how truly honored it is


660
00:31:01.685 --> 00:31:04.922
to have you here this evening,
and looking so radiant.


661
00:31:05.022 --> 00:31:07.491
Why, thank you, Todd.

662
00:31:07.591 --> 00:31:09.626
Perhaps I'll have you deliver
my eulogy.


663
00:31:10.928 --> 00:31:11.862
Maggie...

664
00:31:12.997 --> 00:31:14.865
don't even talk like that.

665
00:31:14.966 --> 00:31:17.969
Of course, I'd be honored
to, uh, read at your funeral--


666
00:31:18.069 --> 00:31:19.369
Cool your jets, Todd.

667
00:31:19.469 --> 00:31:20.837
I'll probably screw
everything up,


668
00:31:20.938 --> 00:31:21.939
and outlive all of you.

669
00:31:23.306 --> 00:31:26.010
Oh, Maggie.

670
00:31:29.213 --> 00:31:30.313
Dinner is served.

671
00:31:30.413 --> 00:31:32.049
Yum.

672
00:31:37.021 --> 00:31:39.257
I guess I've always
had a thing for numbers.


673
00:31:39.356 --> 00:31:41.725
A passion really.

674
00:31:41.825 --> 00:31:44.628
And most kids hate the idea
that math is all around us.


675
00:31:44.728 --> 00:31:47.798
It's in the portions of food
on your dinner plate.


676
00:31:47.899 --> 00:31:51.868
The number of friends and family
you can sit around the table.


677
00:31:51.969 --> 00:31:54.371
The number of beats per minute
of the heart of a man


678
00:31:54.471 --> 00:31:56.339
madly in love.

679
00:31:57.407 --> 00:32:00.244
Well, there's...
there's a pureness to math.


680
00:32:00.343 --> 00:32:02.612
And a beauty.

681
00:32:02.712 --> 00:32:06.316
You know, a certain completeness
in combination.


682
00:32:06.416 --> 00:32:09.619
The sum is greater
than its parts.


683
00:32:09.719 --> 00:32:11.888
You sure don't talk
like an accountant.


684
00:32:11.989 --> 00:32:14.658
Accountant, right.

685
00:32:14.758 --> 00:32:18.129
I still like
the international playboy angle.


686
00:32:18.229 --> 00:32:20.064
Nope. Numbers guy.

687
00:32:20.164 --> 00:32:22.732
Oh, okay, Mr. Einstein.

688
00:32:22.833 --> 00:32:25.069
Hey, Rob,
what firm did you say


689
00:32:25.169 --> 00:32:26.536
you were working for again?

690
00:32:26.636 --> 00:32:28.306
Robinson & Younger.

691
00:32:28.405 --> 00:32:29.739
Is that right?

692
00:32:29.840 --> 00:32:32.944
You know, I think I know
a couple of guys over there.


693
00:32:33.044 --> 00:32:34.178
What's the manager's name again?

694
00:32:34.278 --> 00:32:35.378
Let's not bore the party with--

695
00:32:35.478 --> 00:32:37.881
Roger. Roger McLaren.

696
00:32:37.982 --> 00:32:39.516
Roger. Right. Right.

697
00:32:39.616 --> 00:32:41.319
So, he would know you.

698
00:32:41.418 --> 00:32:42.752
That's highly unlikely.

699
00:32:42.853 --> 00:32:44.554
They don't let me
out of the cellar very often.


700
00:32:47.724 --> 00:32:49.759
No. To be honest,
I haven't had much of a chance


701
00:32:49.860 --> 00:32:51.761
to mingle since transferring
here from Chicago.


702
00:32:51.862 --> 00:32:52.997
Oh, sure, sure.

703
00:32:53.097 --> 00:32:54.497
Of course, of course.

704
00:32:54.598 --> 00:32:56.867
But you've been doing some
consulting with our company.


705
00:32:56.968 --> 00:32:58.602
Did you know that, Carl?

706
00:32:58.702 --> 00:33:01.105
Oh. I don't really handle
the books.


707
00:33:01.205 --> 00:33:02.439
Oh, yes.

708
00:33:02.539 --> 00:33:05.142
Anyone actually seen this guy?

709
00:33:05.243 --> 00:33:06.344
Of course, Todd.

710
00:33:06.443 --> 00:33:08.012
-Really?
-Yeah.


711
00:33:08.112 --> 00:33:10.380
I've corresponded with Rob
a couple of times.


712
00:33:10.480 --> 00:33:12.682
I just never made
the romantic connection.


713
00:33:14.751 --> 00:33:17.355
Chicago.
Is that where you're from?


714
00:33:17.454 --> 00:33:18.923
Yes. Born and raised.

715
00:33:19.023 --> 00:33:21.524
I... I grew up
around restaurants actually.


716
00:33:21.625 --> 00:33:23.961
My dad started out as a waiter
at a little French place


717
00:33:24.061 --> 00:33:25.428
just like this.

718
00:33:25.528 --> 00:33:27.731
An engagement party
would break his heart.


719
00:33:27.831 --> 00:33:28.431
Really?

720
00:33:28.531 --> 00:33:29.934
Oh, sure.

721
00:33:30.034 --> 00:33:32.003
He'd say, "There's one less
bachelor come here to eat


722
00:33:32.103 --> 00:33:33.137
every night."

723
00:33:35.172 --> 00:33:37.341
He was a little old-fashioned.

724
00:33:37.440 --> 00:33:38.943
I see.

725
00:33:39.043 --> 00:33:41.611
After my mom died,

726
00:33:41.711 --> 00:33:44.248
he decided to open up
a little place of his own.


727
00:33:44.348 --> 00:33:45.582
He did all right.

728
00:33:45.682 --> 00:33:48.885
But I saw the toll
it took on him.


729
00:33:48.986 --> 00:33:52.856
Being the face of a business,
it's hard on family life.


730
00:33:53.823 --> 00:33:55.092
People don't wanna see
the waiters.


731
00:33:55.192 --> 00:33:56.860
They wanna see you.

732
00:33:56.961 --> 00:33:58.963
He was hoping that he'd hand
the whole thing over to me,


733
00:33:59.063 --> 00:34:01.831
but...
I went a different direction.


734
00:34:01.933 --> 00:34:04.101
Into the exciting world
of numbers.


735
00:34:05.403 --> 00:34:07.437
Yeah. Yeah, something like that.

736
00:34:09.539 --> 00:34:12.642
But now, I'm...
I'm ready for a new journey.


737
00:34:13.810 --> 00:34:15.578
I... I don't know
if it was the moonlight,


738
00:34:15.679 --> 00:34:17.681
reflecting off the pool
that lit up her eyes


739
00:34:17.781 --> 00:34:18.916
when I first saw them.

740
00:34:19.016 --> 00:34:20.650
Pool?

741
00:34:20.750 --> 00:34:22.786
I thought you were skiing.

742
00:34:22.886 --> 00:34:23.988
Skiing?

743
00:34:24.989 --> 00:34:27.490
The... the pool came
after the skiing.


744
00:34:27.590 --> 00:34:28.658
Yeah. Mm-hmm. Right.

745
00:34:28.758 --> 00:34:30.061
We, um...

746
00:34:31.295 --> 00:34:33.998
I would just like
to thank you all for being here


747
00:34:34.098 --> 00:34:35.598
this evening.

748
00:34:35.699 --> 00:34:38.668
This is as much for my
grandmother as it is for us.


749
00:34:38.768 --> 00:34:41.072
Thank you, both of you.

750
00:34:43.307 --> 00:34:46.143
And with that, I'm afraid
we must bid you all adieu.


751
00:34:46.243 --> 00:34:46.810
Mm.

752
00:34:46.911 --> 00:34:48.179
Okay.

753
00:34:48.279 --> 00:34:50.348
Darling, shall we?

754
00:34:50.448 --> 00:34:51.815
Of course.

755
00:34:57.421 --> 00:34:58.755
- Okay.
- Nice to meet you all.


756
00:34:58.855 --> 00:35:01.158
- Bye.
- And nice to meet you, Robert.


757
00:35:01.258 --> 00:35:02.659
Todd.

758
00:35:05.495 --> 00:35:07.530
What did I say
about improvising?


759
00:35:07.630 --> 00:35:09.033
The pool was a little slip.

760
00:35:09.133 --> 00:35:10.167
A little slip.

761
00:35:10.267 --> 00:35:11.335
I just though we needed

762
00:35:11.435 --> 00:35:12.370
to get back
to the romantic stuff.


763
00:35:14.704 --> 00:35:17.441
Oh, come on.
The crowd was loving it.


764
00:35:17.540 --> 00:35:19.676
Hmm.
I guess it did go over well.


765
00:35:21.278 --> 00:35:23.014
Thank you for the save
on the accounting manager.


766
00:35:23.114 --> 00:35:25.349
I did not have that
in the character profile.


767
00:35:25.449 --> 00:35:27.284
-Hey. I did my research.
-Okay.


768
00:35:29.053 --> 00:35:30.587
-Tracey.
-Todd.


769
00:35:30.687 --> 00:35:31.755
-Numbers guy.
-Hi.


770
00:35:33.190 --> 00:35:35.759
Thanks for coming, Todd.
It was a pleasure.


771
00:35:35.859 --> 00:35:37.028
You could've warned me
about Todd.


772
00:35:37.128 --> 00:35:38.295
I'm sorry.

773
00:35:39.562 --> 00:35:42.400
Such a lovely evening.

774
00:35:42.500 --> 00:35:44.001
So, what have you planned
for the wedding?


775
00:35:44.101 --> 00:35:47.104
I know Claude very well
at the Somerset Tea House.


776
00:35:47.204 --> 00:35:48.472
It's such a romantic place.

777
00:35:48.571 --> 00:35:49.806
- It'd be perfect!
- Mm.


778
00:35:49.907 --> 00:35:52.809
We were thinking of keeping it
a small affair.


779
00:35:52.910 --> 00:35:54.111
Justice of the peace
and a few friends.


780
00:35:54.211 --> 00:35:55.479
Hmm.

781
00:35:55.612 --> 00:35:57.481
I see.

782
00:35:57.580 --> 00:36:00.051
Well, I guess it shouldn't
matter to me anyway.


783
00:36:01.252 --> 00:36:03.753
Well, it wouldn't hurt us
just to look at the place.


784
00:36:03.853 --> 00:36:04.922
Oh, bless you, darling.

785
00:36:05.022 --> 00:36:07.757
I was hoping
that you would say that.


786
00:36:07.857 --> 00:36:10.261
Allan and I can meet you there
tomorrow at noon.


787
00:36:11.462 --> 00:36:12.930
We'd be delighted.

788
00:36:13.030 --> 00:36:13.830
Delighted.

789
00:36:13.931 --> 00:36:15.299
Very well.

790
00:36:15.399 --> 00:36:16.599
Onward, driver.

791
00:36:16.699 --> 00:36:18.635
But, of course, mademoiselle.

792
00:36:18.735 --> 00:36:21.571
I'll see you later!

793
00:36:21.671 --> 00:36:22.973
- Love you.
- Love you, sweetie.


794
00:36:25.543 --> 00:36:26.609
What was that?

795
00:36:26.709 --> 00:36:27.945
This was supposed to be it.

796
00:36:28.045 --> 00:36:30.081
A couple weeks of joy.
That's what you said.


797
00:36:31.449 --> 00:36:32.582
I'm game if you are.

798
00:36:33.616 --> 00:36:34.985
I'll even give you a discount.

799
00:36:35.086 --> 00:36:36.153
A discount.

800
00:36:37.687 --> 00:36:40.091
No skiing or pool stories,
all right?


801
00:36:40.191 --> 00:36:41.292
Yes, dear.

802
00:36:41.392 --> 00:36:45.930
Don't "Yes, dear" me, Rob Jones.

803
00:37:06.716 --> 00:37:08.219
Good morning.

804
00:37:08.319 --> 00:37:09.286
Hi.

805
00:37:10.653 --> 00:37:12.423
Two milk, one sweetener, right?

806
00:37:12.523 --> 00:37:13.823
Yeah.

807
00:37:14.791 --> 00:37:15.559
How did you know that?

808
00:37:15.658 --> 00:37:17.294
Attention to detail.

809
00:37:19.263 --> 00:37:20.763
What are you doing here?

810
00:37:20.864 --> 00:37:22.333
I thought we'd do
a little acting exercise.


811
00:37:22.433 --> 00:37:24.268
-Get in the character.
-A what?


812
00:37:24.368 --> 00:37:26.237
Come on. Get your coat.

813
00:37:27.704 --> 00:37:29.706
Trust me, you'll love it.

814
00:37:31.509 --> 00:37:32.876
Okay.

815
00:37:38.149 --> 00:37:39.583
Can you tell me
where we're going?


816
00:37:42.286 --> 00:37:43.220
Trust me.

817
00:37:43.320 --> 00:37:44.787
Okay.

818
00:37:50.995 --> 00:37:53.264
I had this bit part
on this Western TV show


819
00:37:53.364 --> 00:37:54.231
a few years back.

820
00:37:54.331 --> 00:37:55.698
Mm-hmm.

821
00:37:55.798 --> 00:37:58.335
I played this juggler
in this traveling group


822
00:37:58.435 --> 00:38:00.070
of performers.

823
00:38:00.171 --> 00:38:01.605
I had two lines.

824
00:38:01.704 --> 00:38:03.007
"The show must go on."

825
00:38:03.107 --> 00:38:05.643
And "Pardon me, ma'am,
but I do believe your cow


826
00:38:05.742 --> 00:38:07.278
just ate
one of my juggling clubs.


827
00:38:09.746 --> 00:38:12.316
I had three minutes
of screen time,


828
00:38:12.416 --> 00:38:14.919
but I took three days,

829
00:38:15.019 --> 00:38:18.821
and I developed
this... this whole backstory


830
00:38:18.923 --> 00:38:20.257
for this juggler.

831
00:38:20.357 --> 00:38:21.926
-Backstory?
-Yeah.


832
00:38:22.026 --> 00:38:25.762
Like, well, how did he end up
with this motley crew?


833
00:38:25.862 --> 00:38:29.099
And did he come
from a long line of jugglers?


834
00:38:29.200 --> 00:38:33.070
Or did he earn a degree
in projectile throwing


835
00:38:33.170 --> 00:38:36.040
from a prestigious
juggling university?


836
00:38:36.140 --> 00:38:40.110
I... I even gave him
this slight Swedish accent.


837
00:38:42.580 --> 00:38:44.714
I figured he grew up juggling
pickled herrings.


838
00:38:44.814 --> 00:38:46.150
Oh, wow.

839
00:38:48.818 --> 00:38:50.988
It's called an origin story.

840
00:38:51.088 --> 00:38:52.822
You see, even though
I only had a couple of lines


841
00:38:52.923 --> 00:38:56.594
and a... a few minutes'
screen time,


842
00:38:56.694 --> 00:38:59.129
the backstory made
the character


843
00:38:59.230 --> 00:39:03.200
more... more real, more...
more alive.


844
00:39:05.768 --> 00:39:07.471
Even if you did stink
of herring.


845
00:39:10.007 --> 00:39:11.942
Like, what about us, huh?

846
00:39:12.042 --> 00:39:14.578
What's our origin story?

847
00:39:14.678 --> 00:39:15.812
Oh. I think you rolled that out

848
00:39:15.913 --> 00:39:18.148
with your skiing-slash-
pool party gig.


849
00:39:18.249 --> 00:39:22.486
Yeah. That's how we met,
but who are we?


850
00:39:24.054 --> 00:39:26.523
Tell me about
this Rob Jones guy.


851
00:39:26.624 --> 00:39:30.294
What attracted you to him?

852
00:39:30.394 --> 00:39:33.063
Uh, the usual things.

853
00:39:33.163 --> 00:39:36.766
He's honest, hard working.

854
00:39:36.866 --> 00:39:38.502
Sensible shoes.

855
00:39:38.602 --> 00:39:41.639
Sounds like a real
prince charming.


856
00:39:44.208 --> 00:39:45.409
He, um...

857
00:39:47.044 --> 00:39:49.346
he has a nice smile.

858
00:39:49.446 --> 00:39:51.348
Really?

859
00:39:51.448 --> 00:39:52.815
Mm-hmm.

860
00:39:54.184 --> 00:39:55.719
And, um,

861
00:39:55.818 --> 00:39:58.589
a chihuahua named Louie.

862
00:39:58.689 --> 00:40:02.059
Yes. Now, we're talkin'!

863
00:40:04.495 --> 00:40:08.032
Okay. Well, what about this
Tracey Westmoreland character?


864
00:40:08.132 --> 00:40:09.533
Hmm?

865
00:40:09.633 --> 00:40:10.701
Let's see.

866
00:40:10.800 --> 00:40:13.070
She... she does wear
sensible shoes.


867
00:40:14.238 --> 00:40:16.974
But she's also got
this gorgeous red pair


868
00:40:17.074 --> 00:40:18.175
of patent leather heels

869
00:40:18.275 --> 00:40:20.110
that she wears
for special occasions.


870
00:40:21.145 --> 00:40:23.414
She works as an editor
at a publishing firm,


871
00:40:23.514 --> 00:40:27.985
but she secretly wants to start
a hippie commune in Oregon.


872
00:40:31.121 --> 00:40:33.757
I did spend a lot of time
wandering the wilderness


873
00:40:33.856 --> 00:40:36.393
in my... in my youth.

874
00:40:44.034 --> 00:40:46.036
After my parents died, I, um...

875
00:40:47.971 --> 00:40:49.907
I closed myself off
a little I guess.


876
00:40:51.642 --> 00:40:53.010
My grandmother was great.

877
00:40:54.211 --> 00:40:55.979
I mean...

878
00:40:56.080 --> 00:41:00.084
she just lost her son
and her daughter-in-law, but...


879
00:41:01.185 --> 00:41:02.553
she stepped right in...

880
00:41:04.154 --> 00:41:06.957
with... unconditional love

881
00:41:07.057 --> 00:41:11.295
for a sad and angry

882
00:41:19.103 --> 00:41:21.905
We should... we should probably
get back to port.


883
00:41:22.005 --> 00:41:23.607
Don't wanna be late
for the ball.


884
00:41:35.885 --> 00:41:38.288
Listen, Tracey,
I... I wanted tell you...


885
00:41:39.356 --> 00:41:41.258
when I was telling about my mom
last night, I...


886
00:41:42.393 --> 00:41:45.195
I meant no offense
to your folks.


887
00:41:45.295 --> 00:41:47.631
It's all right, Rob. I know.

888
00:41:47.731 --> 00:41:49.400
Sometimes life is a series of...

889
00:41:50.501 --> 00:41:52.302
half truths.

890
00:41:52.403 --> 00:41:53.971
I know.

891
00:41:54.071 --> 00:41:56.573
Maybe Rob Jones knows
a little bit more about life


892
00:41:56.673 --> 00:41:58.509
than just sensible shoes.

893
00:41:58.609 --> 00:42:00.244
Maybe.

894
00:42:00.344 --> 00:42:04.181
He... he does know
what it's like to be a...


895
00:42:05.983 --> 00:42:10.053
a sad and an angry little kid.

896
00:42:12.656 --> 00:42:14.191
My mom really did die...

897
00:42:15.692 --> 00:42:17.227
when I was nine.

898
00:42:26.503 --> 00:42:27.971
Come on.

899
00:42:28.071 --> 00:42:30.240
I don't wanna leave Maggie
standing at the altar.


900
00:42:36.547 --> 00:42:38.549
Good morning. And welcome
to the Somerset Tea House.


901
00:42:38.649 --> 00:42:39.983
Are you here for tea or a tour?

902
00:42:40.083 --> 00:42:42.453
We're meeting someone
for a tour.


903
00:42:42.553 --> 00:42:44.688
Oh. Forgive me.
It's Tracey, isn't it?


904
00:42:44.788 --> 00:42:46.089
Yeah.

905
00:42:46.190 --> 00:42:47.991
- Oh, my. Your grandmother.
- How is she?


906
00:42:48.091 --> 00:42:50.527
Better.
We're meeting her here.


907
00:42:50.627 --> 00:42:53.564
And you're considering
having your ceremony here?


908
00:42:54.865 --> 00:42:55.799
Wonderful!

909
00:42:55.900 --> 00:42:57.334
It's just a tour.

910
00:42:57.434 --> 00:42:58.402
Well...

911
00:42:59.470 --> 00:43:01.405
...may I be so bold
as to confess


912
00:43:01.505 --> 00:43:04.174
that your love for one another
simply radiates


913
00:43:04.274 --> 00:43:05.375
from your very beings?

914
00:43:07.845 --> 00:43:09.580
It's that obvious, huh?

915
00:43:09.680 --> 00:43:11.950
-Good morning, lovers!
-Good morning, lovers!


916
00:43:12.049 --> 00:43:13.484
Maggie.

917
00:43:13.584 --> 00:43:15.385
My little dance routine
last night reminded me


918
00:43:15.486 --> 00:43:17.154
I still need my wheels
now and then.


919
00:43:17.254 --> 00:43:18.455
- Mm.
- Mm.


920
00:43:18.555 --> 00:43:19.523
Hello, Claude.

921
00:43:19.623 --> 00:43:21.058
Oh, Mrs. Westmoreland.

922
00:43:21.158 --> 00:43:23.794
May I say what an honor it is
for us to host you.


923
00:43:23.895 --> 00:43:25.462
This will be an event
to remember.


924
00:43:25.562 --> 00:43:26.330
It's just a tour.

925
00:43:26.430 --> 00:43:27.364
Wonderful!

926
00:43:27.464 --> 00:43:28.999
Feel free to make yourselves
at home.


927
00:43:29.099 --> 00:43:30.634
Roam the grounds
at your leisure.


928
00:43:30.734 --> 00:43:33.403
We can't wait to help you
celebrate your magical day!


929
00:43:33.504 --> 00:43:34.906
Well, we're just heading up
for another service


930
00:43:35.005 --> 00:43:36.406
this afternoon.

931
00:43:36.507 --> 00:43:38.475
I will be in the event room
if you have any questions.


932
00:43:41.980 --> 00:43:45.349
Right.
Let's go out into the sunshine.


933
00:43:45.449 --> 00:43:46.416
Onward, driver.

934
00:43:46.517 --> 00:43:48.785
But, of course,
mademoiselle.


935
00:43:51.722 --> 00:43:53.357
Wonderful.

936
00:43:56.326 --> 00:43:58.862
- It's beautiful.
- Simply beautiful.


937
00:43:58.963 --> 00:44:00.430
It certainly is.

938
00:44:01.698 --> 00:44:03.867
Would you two kids mind
doing me a favor?


939
00:44:03.968 --> 00:44:05.035
What's that, Grams?

940
00:44:05.135 --> 00:44:07.204
Could you just stand over there?

941
00:44:07.304 --> 00:44:09.373
You know, so I could just take
a picture.


942
00:44:09.473 --> 00:44:10.140
Grama, really?

943
00:44:10.240 --> 00:44:12.776
Maggie, we'd be delighted.

944
00:44:18.715 --> 00:44:21.019
Stop it.

945
00:44:21.118 --> 00:44:22.553
Well, here we at.

946
00:44:22.653 --> 00:44:24.354
- It's Chad.
- It really is quite magical.


947
00:44:24.454 --> 00:44:26.590
Yeah, wish I could do
a disappearing trick right now.


948
00:44:26.690 --> 00:44:27.157
Smile.

949
00:44:27.257 --> 00:44:29.059
Mm.

950
00:44:31.996 --> 00:44:34.131
Oh, my God. It is him.

951
00:44:35.699 --> 00:44:38.368
I'm so embarrassed.

952
00:44:38.468 --> 00:44:39.536
- Oh.
- But I just had to meet you.


953
00:44:40.704 --> 00:44:41.973
Are you coming back
for a second season?


954
00:44:42.072 --> 00:44:43.273
Second season of what?

955
00:44:43.373 --> 00:44:45.142
Sinners of the City.

956
00:44:45.242 --> 00:44:46.945
Chad the mechanic!

957
00:44:47.045 --> 00:44:48.178
Ladies, I'm sorry.

958
00:44:48.278 --> 00:44:49.013
I'm not... I'm not
who you think I am.


959
00:44:49.112 --> 00:44:50.247
You were so sexy.

960
00:44:50.347 --> 00:44:51.214
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

961
00:44:51.315 --> 00:44:51.916
I'm not who you think I am.

962
00:44:56.219 --> 00:44:57.187
Ladies, ladies.

963
00:44:57.287 --> 00:44:57.888
You were so...

964
00:45:05.128 --> 00:45:07.130
Ladies, please. Please.

965
00:45:15.940 --> 00:45:18.076
- Oh, my God.
- I can't believe it.


966
00:45:21.445 --> 00:45:23.246
Sinners of the City?

967
00:45:23.347 --> 00:45:24.548
It was a bit part.

968
00:45:24.648 --> 00:45:26.416
A terrible show
a couple years back.


969
00:45:26.516 --> 00:45:27.952
I totally forgot about it.

970
00:45:28.052 --> 00:45:30.787
Well, let's hope we don't run
into anymore "Chad" fans.


971
00:45:34.825 --> 00:45:35.994
Oh, my goodness.

972
00:45:36.094 --> 00:45:38.629
Look at this chair.
This is incredible.


973
00:45:38.729 --> 00:45:39.796
Hello. May I?

974
00:45:39.897 --> 00:45:40.797
-Really?
-Yeah.


975
00:45:40.898 --> 00:45:41.732
-I got it.
-No, I got it.


976
00:45:41.832 --> 00:45:43.200
-I got it!
-I got it.


977
00:45:43.300 --> 00:45:45.469
-Oh, you got it.
-Thank you.


978
00:45:45.569 --> 00:45:47.237
Oh, and it goes backwards,
are you kidding me?


979
00:45:47.337 --> 00:45:48.538
Careful.

980
00:45:48.639 --> 00:45:49.941
Let's really take this
for a spin.


981
00:45:50.041 --> 00:45:51.642
Let's get the cars.

982
00:45:51.742 --> 00:45:53.610
Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh!

983
00:45:55.345 --> 00:45:57.514
- It's okay. Let's go.
- He does this every day.


984
00:45:57.614 --> 00:45:58.482
What?

985
00:45:58.582 --> 00:45:59.750
Yeah. He, like, volunteers.

986
00:45:59.850 --> 00:46:03.620
And this I believe
is your stop, my lady?


987
00:46:08.191 --> 00:46:09.292
Let's get in the car.

988
00:46:09.393 --> 00:46:10.962
- So comfortable.
- Okay.


989
00:46:11.062 --> 00:46:12.596
- Ooh!
- Slowly.


990
00:46:12.696 --> 00:46:13.864
Oh.

991
00:46:16.233 --> 00:46:17.834
- Ah, yeah.
- Uh-huh.


992
00:46:17.935 --> 00:46:19.536
Uh-huh.

993
00:46:21.105 --> 00:46:24.841
Well, all right, sweetie.
I'll call you.


994
00:46:24.942 --> 00:46:27.078
I'd like to have you both
over for dinner again soon.


995
00:46:27.177 --> 00:46:29.613
Maximize my time with you.

996
00:46:29.713 --> 00:46:30.547
Sounds good, Grams.

997
00:46:30.647 --> 00:46:34.118
Feet in.
Take care, Tracey.


998
00:46:34.919 --> 00:46:36.253
And, Rob.

999
00:46:40.223 --> 00:46:42.093
I kinda wanna call you Chad now.

1000
00:46:43.727 --> 00:46:46.030
Chad!

1001
00:46:46.130 --> 00:46:48.432
You can't-- get outta here.

1002
00:46:48.532 --> 00:46:49.866
I totally forgot about that.

1003
00:46:49.967 --> 00:46:51.568
It wasn't supposed to come out
till next week.


1004
00:46:51.668 --> 00:46:53.137
So, you model as well?

1005
00:46:53.236 --> 00:46:55.139
Oh. Thank God they haven't seen
the commercial.


1006
00:46:55.238 --> 00:46:57.407
An ad campaign and a commercial!

1007
00:46:57.507 --> 00:46:59.543
Are they spinning this
into a mini-series as well?


1008
00:47:01.478 --> 00:47:03.181
Do you have any sunglasses?

1009
00:47:03.313 --> 00:47:04.614
What for?

1010
00:47:04.715 --> 00:47:05.882
To hide your face?

1011
00:47:05.983 --> 00:47:08.552
Look, I'm a working actor.
What am I supposed to do?


1012
00:47:08.652 --> 00:47:11.888
I'm not responsible for reruns
and ad campaigns.


1013
00:47:11.989 --> 00:47:13.925
I just don't like surprises.

1014
00:47:14.025 --> 00:47:15.193
Well, it's been a while

1015
00:47:15.292 --> 00:47:16.460
since I've to submit a resumé
for a job,


1016
00:47:16.560 --> 00:47:17.761
but I can assure you
it's a rambling list


1017
00:47:17.861 --> 00:47:21.298
of corny commercials
and cop number two guys.


1018
00:47:21.398 --> 00:47:23.901
I can't help it
if Chad the mechanic pops up


1019
00:47:24.001 --> 00:47:25.368
every once in a while.

1020
00:47:35.345 --> 00:47:36.981
Lisen, um...

1021
00:47:38.415 --> 00:47:41.085
I really do appreciate
everything you're doing


1022
00:47:41.185 --> 00:47:42.619
for my grandmother.

1023
00:47:42.719 --> 00:47:44.387
I know this must be tough
for you.


1024
00:47:45.522 --> 00:47:47.357
But if you need me,
I'll be there...


1025
00:47:48.358 --> 00:47:50.061
for both of you.

1026
00:47:59.336 --> 00:48:02.672
Hold onto it... for now.

1027
00:48:06.743 --> 00:48:07.945
Thanks, Rob.

1028
00:48:26.496 --> 00:48:28.032
Hey! There's little miss fix it.

1029
00:48:28.132 --> 00:48:29.699
Hello, Todd.
How was your hangover?


1030
00:48:29.800 --> 00:48:31.202
- It was great.
- Thank you for asking.


1031
00:48:31.301 --> 00:48:32.836
How was the weekend
with the crown prince?


1032
00:48:32.937 --> 00:48:34.038
He's an accountant.

1033
00:48:34.138 --> 00:48:35.639
- Oh, right!
- I'm sorry I keep forgetting.


1034
00:48:35.739 --> 00:48:37.507
You know what's weird
is I actually phoned over


1035
00:48:37.607 --> 00:48:38.708
to Robinson & Younger,

1036
00:48:38.809 --> 00:48:41.511
and they've never heard
of a Rob Jones.


1037
00:48:46.583 --> 00:48:48.652
I'm sure if someone were to call
Barmont Publishing


1038
00:48:48.752 --> 00:48:50.687
and ask for a Todd Pearlman,

1039
00:48:50.787 --> 00:48:52.156
they might get
a similar response.


1040
00:48:53.356 --> 00:48:54.691
That's not true.

1041
00:48:54.791 --> 00:48:56.560
Look, maybe I don't wanna see
you get hurt, okay?


1042
00:48:56.660 --> 00:48:59.729
I think you're makin'
a big mistake.


1043
00:48:59.830 --> 00:49:02.200
Okay. He's an accountant
you like numbers, okay?


1044
00:49:02.300 --> 00:49:04.467
I get it.
But I know numbers, you know?


1045
00:49:04.568 --> 00:49:07.205
I-- what number am I thinking
about right now?


1046
00:49:07.305 --> 00:49:08.705
One.

1047
00:49:08.805 --> 00:49:10.740
Lucky guess.
See, we're succinct. We're--


1048
00:49:10.841 --> 00:49:13.476
Todd.
This has been super fun.


1049
00:49:15.146 --> 00:49:18.282
Tracey, I can give you numbers.

1050
00:49:18.381 --> 00:49:18.983
Trace?

1051
00:49:20.851 --> 00:49:22.987
Shelley, did you miss me?

1052
00:49:38.735 --> 00:49:41.105
Got some beaters
for our in-house grease monkey.


1053
00:49:42.439 --> 00:49:45.575
Hello, Miss Miracle Worker!

1054
00:49:45.675 --> 00:49:48.411
Got some clunkers,
and they're out of gas.


1055
00:49:48.511 --> 00:49:50.181
He was telling the truth.

1056
00:49:50.281 --> 00:49:50.982
Come again.

1057
00:49:51.082 --> 00:49:52.449
Rob.

1058
00:49:52.549 --> 00:49:54.919
He was telling the truth
about his upbringing in Chicago.


1059
00:49:55.019 --> 00:49:55.987
Oh, yeah?

1060
00:50:00.324 --> 00:50:03.227
Wow. He is prolific.

1061
00:50:03.327 --> 00:50:05.795
Is Chad the mechanic on there?

1062
00:50:05.897 --> 00:50:07.430
I don't know.
But look at this.


1063
00:50:07.530 --> 00:50:09.000
Look at his bio.

1064
00:50:09.100 --> 00:50:10.467
Born in Chicago.

1065
00:50:10.567 --> 00:50:12.602
Mom died when he was very young.

1066
00:50:12.702 --> 00:50:15.072
Raised by his father,
and like most aspiring actors,


1067
00:50:15.172 --> 00:50:16.340
he waited tables.

1068
00:50:16.439 --> 00:50:18.309
Mm-hmm.

1069
00:50:18.408 --> 00:50:19.743
He was telling the truth.

1070
00:50:30.087 --> 00:50:31.421
What?

1071
00:50:32.356 --> 00:50:34.392
You're falling for this guy.

1072
00:50:34.491 --> 00:50:36.227
What? No, of course, not.

1073
00:50:36.327 --> 00:50:37.827
No.

1074
00:50:37.929 --> 00:50:38.963
Yes, you are.

1075
00:50:39.063 --> 00:50:40.597
I've never seen you look
at a real guy like that,


1076
00:50:40.697 --> 00:50:42.632
let alone a picture of one.

1077
00:50:42.732 --> 00:50:44.035
Don't be ridiculous.

1078
00:50:44.902 --> 00:50:47.038
I'll admit he's... he's cute.

1079
00:50:48.571 --> 00:50:50.975
He definitely looks the part.
I'll give him that.


1080
00:50:51.075 --> 00:50:53.945
He's an actor after all.

1081
00:50:54.045 --> 00:50:55.146
So?

1082
00:50:56.479 --> 00:50:58.782
I'm just saying,
you can't believe everything


1083
00:50:58.882 --> 00:51:01.518
you read on the web,
especially on an actor's bio.


1084
00:51:01.618 --> 00:51:04.654
He's actually very sweet, too.

1085
00:51:04.754 --> 00:51:07.224
True. He's a real Romeo.

1086
00:51:07.325 --> 00:51:09.659
And you make a great Juliet.

1087
00:51:09.759 --> 00:51:10.727
Stop.

1088
00:51:10.827 --> 00:51:15.299
O Romeo, Romeo.
Wherefore art thou, Romeo?


1089
00:51:15.399 --> 00:51:18.735
Deny thy father
and refuse thy name.


1090
00:51:18.835 --> 00:51:21.238
Not a lot of people know
the next line of that speech.


1091
00:51:21.339 --> 00:51:22.572
Classically trained.

1092
00:51:22.672 --> 00:51:24.641
Sorry,
I was in the neighborhood.


1093
00:51:24.741 --> 00:51:27.078
Can I take you for lunch?

1094
00:51:27.178 --> 00:51:28.812
I wanna ask you something.

1095
00:51:34.418 --> 00:51:36.287
That's up to her!

1096
00:51:36.387 --> 00:51:37.854
I could eat, but whatever.

1097
00:51:37.955 --> 00:51:39.589
Okay, bye-bye.

1098
00:51:39.689 --> 00:51:43.394
Yeah, yeah.
I... I would love to eat.


1099
00:51:43.493 --> 00:51:45.628
I'll just get my bag.

1100
00:51:54.704 --> 00:51:55.973
Can I ask you something?

1101
00:51:56.073 --> 00:51:57.607
Shoot.

1102
00:51:57.707 --> 00:51:59.143
Are you really from Chicago?

1103
00:52:00.244 --> 00:52:01.845
I am.

1104
00:52:01.946 --> 00:52:03.347
So, the other night
at the party


1105
00:52:03.447 --> 00:52:05.582
when you were talking
about your past,


1106
00:52:05.682 --> 00:52:09.320
your mom and dad...
were you telling the truth?


1107
00:52:09.420 --> 00:52:10.553
I was.

1108
00:52:11.888 --> 00:52:13.391
I just figured
it was easier that way.


1109
00:52:15.059 --> 00:52:16.793
I realized I might have been
going off script, but it just...


1110
00:52:18.129 --> 00:52:19.596
it felt right.

1111
00:52:19.696 --> 00:52:22.133
Honestly, it was... it was nice.

1112
00:52:23.633 --> 00:52:25.802
See, sometimes,
acting's all about improvising.


1113
00:52:27.104 --> 00:52:29.040
If things change, then you...
you roll with it.


1114
00:52:29.140 --> 00:52:30.074
Mm.

1115
00:52:30.174 --> 00:52:31.574
And if your partner
has a great idea,


1116
00:52:31.674 --> 00:52:32.542
you go with it.

1117
00:52:32.642 --> 00:52:35.913
It's called... chemistry.

1118
00:52:36.013 --> 00:52:37.048
Hmm.

1119
00:52:37.148 --> 00:52:40.985
Like Laurel and Hardy,
or Newman and Redford.


1120
00:52:41.684 --> 00:52:44.155
Bogey and Bacall.

1121
00:52:45.189 --> 00:52:46.290
Exactly.

1122
00:52:47.824 --> 00:52:48.825
So, what did you...

1123
00:52:48.926 --> 00:52:50.727
what did you wanna ask me?

1124
00:52:50.827 --> 00:52:52.796
I just wanted float
something past you.


1125
00:52:55.232 --> 00:52:57.435
I mean, you have this knack
for problem-solving.


1126
00:52:57.535 --> 00:52:58.802
Mm-hmm.

1127
00:52:58.903 --> 00:53:00.071
They don't call me
the fix-it gal for nothing.


1128
00:53:01.805 --> 00:53:04.475
Even if it's crazy,
and it doesn't make any sense?


1129
00:53:04.574 --> 00:53:06.010
But when you think about it,
it kinda does?


1130
00:53:06.110 --> 00:53:08.878
Yeah. I mean,
life is crazy, right?


1131
00:53:08.979 --> 00:53:12.316
A lot of things in life don't,
I mean, make sense.


1132
00:53:12.416 --> 00:53:14.884
Okay. Here goes.

1133
00:53:16.719 --> 00:53:18.189
I'm going to be a dad...

1134
00:53:19.957 --> 00:53:21.325
I hope.

1135
00:53:21.425 --> 00:53:22.592
What?

1136
00:53:22.692 --> 00:53:25.196
In a streaming series. A part.

1137
00:53:25.296 --> 00:53:26.163
Oh!

1138
00:53:26.263 --> 00:53:27.298
My agent just called.

1139
00:53:27.398 --> 00:53:29.033
They wanna see an audition tape.

1140
00:53:29.133 --> 00:53:32.103
It's a tiny part,
but it's recurring...


1141
00:53:32.203 --> 00:53:33.204
if I get it.

1142
00:53:33.304 --> 00:53:35.339
A part. Yeah.

1143
00:53:35.439 --> 00:53:37.975
Hey. But they shoot
the pilot here.


1144
00:53:38.075 --> 00:53:38.943
Oh, really?

1145
00:53:39.043 --> 00:53:40.077
Yeah.

1146
00:53:40.177 --> 00:53:42.480
Then it's just back to LA.
I just don't know


1147
00:53:42.580 --> 00:53:44.881
whether I should send
the tape in or not.


1148
00:53:44.982 --> 00:53:46.450
I'm done with rejection,
you know?


1149
00:53:46.550 --> 00:53:47.851
Mm. Mm-hmm.

1150
00:53:47.952 --> 00:53:49.886
But it's not a mechanic.

1151
00:53:51.788 --> 00:53:53.324
It's a cop show.

1152
00:53:55.192 --> 00:53:56.327
Would you read it?

1153
00:53:57.561 --> 00:53:58.828
You know, as an editor,

1154
00:53:58.929 --> 00:54:00.797
you could tell me
what you think of this guy.


1155
00:54:00.898 --> 00:54:03.633
You know, how I should approach
this character.


1156
00:54:03.733 --> 00:54:05.369
-Sure.
-Really?


1157
00:54:06.803 --> 00:54:08.072
Because I was thinking
of packing


1158
00:54:08.172 --> 00:54:10.441
this whole acting thing,
and, you know,


1159
00:54:10.541 --> 00:54:12.576
maybe become a real accountant.

1160
00:54:12.675 --> 00:54:14.677
No, Rob. If...

1161
00:54:14.777 --> 00:54:18.848
if the part's good,
I'm... I'm happy for you.


1162
00:54:18.949 --> 00:54:20.683
I know you'd understand.

1163
00:54:22.685 --> 00:54:24.654
You know, Joe Pesci
was going to quit acting


1164
00:54:24.754 --> 00:54:26.457
right before he got Raging Bull?

1165
00:54:26.557 --> 00:54:28.359
- Really?
- Hmm.


1166
00:54:28.459 --> 00:54:29.792
Didn't know that before.

1167
00:54:29.894 --> 00:54:32.463
Maybe I could stop by
your office this afternoon


1168
00:54:32.563 --> 00:54:33.796
with... with the script.

1169
00:54:34.797 --> 00:54:36.200
Yeah. Sure.

1170
00:54:43.908 --> 00:54:47.677
Tracey, Tracey, Tracey. Tracey.

1171
00:54:48.678 --> 00:54:50.347
Do you ever work?

1172
00:54:50.447 --> 00:54:51.515
Oh, I've been working.

1173
00:54:51.615 --> 00:54:53.617
Fact-checking on your boyfriend.

1174
00:54:53.716 --> 00:54:55.052
He's not my boyfriend.

1175
00:54:55.152 --> 00:54:56.753
Pull up his bio.

1176
00:54:59.822 --> 00:55:01.192
There, look.

1177
00:55:03.127 --> 00:55:04.128
Oh, wait.

1178
00:55:05.563 --> 00:55:06.863
Look.

1179
00:55:08.532 --> 00:55:09.934
What?

1180
00:55:10.034 --> 00:55:11.969
Remember what he said
about his dad?


1181
00:55:12.069 --> 00:55:13.703
He was a waiter
in a French restaurant,


1182
00:55:13.803 --> 00:55:16.140
and he opened up
a little place of his own.


1183
00:55:16.240 --> 00:55:17.308
He did all right.

1184
00:55:19.043 --> 00:55:21.744
His father
is Arthur Hollingsworth.


1185
00:55:21.844 --> 00:55:23.681
Founder and CEO of the chain

1186
00:55:23.813 --> 00:55:25.983
of Hollingsworth's
fine-dining restaurants.


1187
00:55:27.117 --> 00:55:29.553
Okay. So?

1188
00:55:29.653 --> 00:55:31.754
So? It means he's loaded.

1189
00:55:31.854 --> 00:55:33.823
Why would he lie about that?

1190
00:55:33.924 --> 00:55:35.926
It's not exactly a lie.

1191
00:55:37.394 --> 00:55:38.329
More of an act.

1192
00:55:39.463 --> 00:55:41.966
Hi, my name's Rob.

1193
00:55:42.066 --> 00:55:44.468
I'm not a real serial killer,
but I play one on TV.


1194
00:55:44.568 --> 00:55:45.436
-Boo!
-Ah!


1195
00:55:47.238 --> 00:55:48.805
I'm so sorry.

1196
00:55:48.906 --> 00:55:50.574
Hello, Shelley. Oh.

1197
00:55:50.674 --> 00:55:52.910
We have to stop meeting
like this.


1198
00:55:53.010 --> 00:55:54.777
Robert Jones, hello.

1199
00:55:56.113 --> 00:55:58.382
- Back to my fact-checking.
- Mm.


1200
00:56:02.720 --> 00:56:03.886
You up for a read?

1201
00:56:05.422 --> 00:56:07.925
So, I thought we could run
some lines even


1202
00:56:08.025 --> 00:56:10.628
if you don't mind playing
a gum-smacking waitress.


1203
00:56:10.728 --> 00:56:12.862
I'm the hitman
who knocked you up.


1204
00:56:12.963 --> 00:56:14.898
But I'm trying to go straight.

1205
00:56:17.001 --> 00:56:19.003
Can I ask you
something personal?


1206
00:56:19.103 --> 00:56:20.837
Who's improvising now?

1207
00:56:23.140 --> 00:56:26.176
Tell me about that restaurant
that your dad opened.


1208
00:56:30.347 --> 00:56:31.582
My dad?

1209
00:56:31.682 --> 00:56:36.153
Yeah. I saw the photo
buried in your bio page.


1210
00:56:37.087 --> 00:56:40.090
You and your dad,
it was a recent picture.


1211
00:56:40.190 --> 00:56:42.459
You know you pay an agent
to update those things.


1212
00:56:43.860 --> 00:56:45.496
Is your dad
Arthur Hollingsworth?


1213
00:56:46.796 --> 00:56:48.165
Yes.

1214
00:56:49.133 --> 00:56:50.701
And why does that matter?

1215
00:56:50.800 --> 00:56:53.404
Because my dad
is Arthur Hollingsworth.


1216
00:56:53.504 --> 00:56:55.139
Imagine being the son
of one of the most successful


1217
00:56:55.239 --> 00:56:57.207
restaurateurs in the country.

1218
00:56:57.308 --> 00:56:59.143
Then imagine saying "No"
to that fortune


1219
00:56:59.243 --> 00:57:00.978
when it was offered to you.

1220
00:57:01.078 --> 00:57:03.846
Sounds a lot like being
the granddaughter


1221
00:57:03.947 --> 00:57:05.983
of one of the greatest
romance novelists


1222
00:57:06.083 --> 00:57:07.484
of the 20th century.

1223
00:57:08.818 --> 00:57:10.120
Exactly.

1224
00:57:11.955 --> 00:57:13.924
I spent most of my life
in that shadow,


1225
00:57:14.024 --> 00:57:16.593
and it was awfully cold there.

1226
00:57:18.062 --> 00:57:20.564
So, I decided to step out
into the light


1227
00:57:20.664 --> 00:57:24.568
and just happened to be
in the light of the stage,


1228
00:57:26.236 --> 00:57:29.740
Well, a prominent name
could have opened doors for you.


1229
00:57:29.839 --> 00:57:30.974
If I'm gonna make it,

1230
00:57:31.075 --> 00:57:32.009
I wanted it to be
because I earned it.


1231
00:57:32.109 --> 00:57:33.677
Not because who my father is.

1232
00:57:33.777 --> 00:57:35.713
There's no shame in that.

1233
00:57:40.784 --> 00:57:42.419
Oh, it's Maggie. Hello.

1234
00:57:42.519 --> 00:57:44.221
<i>- Hey, hon. Got a minute?</i>
<i>-</i> Yes.


1235
00:57:44.321 --> 00:57:45.622
<i>What are you doing?</i>

1236
00:57:45.723 --> 00:57:47.491
Actually,
we're just having a drink.


1237
00:57:47.591 --> 00:57:48.559
Is everything okay?

1238
00:57:48.659 --> 00:57:49.859
<i>Yes. Can I see you?</i>

1239
00:57:49.960 --> 00:57:51.061
- Sure.
<i>- Tomorrow.</i>


1240
00:57:51.161 --> 00:57:53.564
Tomorrow? Yeah, 
I'll be there.

1241
00:57:53.664 --> 00:57:54.698
<i>Say "Hi" to Rob.</i>

1242
00:57:54.798 --> 00:57:56.400
Yes. I'll tell him
you say "Hello."


1243
00:57:56.500 --> 00:57:57.867
<i>Okay, bye, hon.</i>

1244
00:57:57.968 --> 00:57:59.403
Okay, bye.

1245
00:58:01.138 --> 00:58:03.374
Maggie is coming
to the office tomorrow.


1246
00:58:03.474 --> 00:58:05.042
A big announcement.

1247
00:58:06.577 --> 00:58:08.078
Thanks for hearing me out.

1248
00:58:09.613 --> 00:58:11.248
Thanks for being honest.

1249
00:58:19.556 --> 00:58:22.025
I'm afraid
I've done something crazy.


1250
00:58:22.126 --> 00:58:23.193
What are you talking about?

1251
00:58:23.293 --> 00:58:25.529
Completely selfish, I know.

1252
00:58:25.629 --> 00:58:26.864
What's going on?

1253
00:58:26.964 --> 00:58:29.032
I spoke with Claude.

1254
00:58:29.133 --> 00:58:31.602
Went by a few days ago
to pay for the attack


1255
00:58:31.702 --> 00:58:33.303
of the Chad fans in the gazebo.

1256
00:58:33.404 --> 00:58:35.839
-Okay.
-And something struck me.


1257
00:58:35.939 --> 00:58:38.075
Just felt right.

1258
00:58:38.175 --> 00:58:39.476
Grama, what have you done?

1259
00:58:39.576 --> 00:58:42.312
I booked a wedding rehearsal
for you and Rob.


1260
00:58:45.249 --> 00:58:47.351
A dress rehearsal really.

1261
00:58:48.619 --> 00:58:49.887
You're kidding.

1262
00:58:49.987 --> 00:58:52.723
Maggie!
What a pleasant surprise.


1263
00:58:52.823 --> 00:58:53.991
What's going on?

1264
00:58:54.091 --> 00:58:56.059
They're having
a wedding dress rehearsal.


1265
00:58:56.160 --> 00:58:57.995
-Wait--
-That's wonderful!


1266
00:58:58.095 --> 00:58:59.096
What's so wonderful?

1267
00:58:59.196 --> 00:59:00.431
Oh. Uh, Tracey and Rob

1268
00:59:00.531 --> 00:59:02.433
are having a wedding dress
rehearsal.


1269
00:59:02.533 --> 00:59:05.002
Oh, yippee!

1270
00:59:08.472 --> 00:59:11.975
I'm sorry, sweetie.
I should have spoken to you.


1271
00:59:12.075 --> 00:59:14.945
I know you both want
a small ceremony.


1272
00:59:15.045 --> 00:59:17.314
And you can still have it.

1273
00:59:17.414 --> 00:59:20.050
This way,
no matter what happens,


1274
00:59:20.150 --> 00:59:23.320
I can say I was there with you.

1275
00:59:23.420 --> 00:59:24.988
Oh, Grama.

1276
00:59:33.030 --> 00:59:35.833
I'm just asking
for this one thing.


1277
00:59:35.934 --> 00:59:39.470
The rest is up to you,
I promise.


1278
00:59:39.570 --> 00:59:40.637
Okay, Grama.

1279
00:59:45.776 --> 00:59:47.811
And you're all invited.

1280
00:59:47.912 --> 00:59:50.380
This Saturday
at the Somerset Tea House.


1281
00:59:50.481 --> 00:59:52.716
And I want you all
in your Sunday best.


1282
00:59:56.955 --> 00:59:59.189
Whoo!

1283
00:59:59.289 --> 01:00:01.992
You know, this is just
like the surprise marriage


1284
01:00:02.092 --> 01:00:03.594
in the fifth Cassandra novel.

1285
01:00:03.694 --> 01:00:07.364
Remember, where she falls
for the Swedish prince!


1286
01:00:07.464 --> 01:00:08.232
-Yeah.
-Oh!


1287
01:00:08.332 --> 01:00:09.934
It's a regular, old fairy-tale.

1288
01:00:10.033 --> 01:00:11.535
Mm-hmm.

1289
01:00:17.474 --> 01:00:19.443
We don't have to do this, Tray.

1290
01:00:19.543 --> 01:00:22.079
It's my grandmother's
dying wish, Shelley.


1291
01:00:27.684 --> 01:00:29.954
Sure. One last show then.

1292
01:00:30.053 --> 01:00:31.455
Maybe.

1293
01:00:31.555 --> 01:00:32.689
Maybe?

1294
01:00:32.789 --> 01:00:34.491
What if it's not a show?

1295
01:00:34.591 --> 01:00:35.526
What do you mean?

1296
01:00:36.527 --> 01:00:40.197
Rob wants to meet
to discuss some big news.


1297
01:00:44.401 --> 01:00:47.104
So, you have fallen in love
with this guy.


1298
01:00:47.204 --> 01:00:48.505
I don't know.

1299
01:00:50.140 --> 01:00:51.375
Maybe I have.

1300
01:01:01.351 --> 01:01:03.220
I guess she likes insurance ads.

1301
01:01:03.320 --> 01:01:06.290
Actually, it's the series,
I guess, Sinners of the City.


1302
01:01:06.390 --> 01:01:08.659
It's been streaming nonstop
online.


1303
01:01:10.794 --> 01:01:12.030
Oh, that reminds me.

1304
01:01:12.129 --> 01:01:14.264
I have not had a chance
to read Walk the Talk.


1305
01:01:14.364 --> 01:01:15.632
But I think you would make

1306
01:01:15.732 --> 01:01:18.970
a wonderful hitman-slash-
long-distance daddy.


1307
01:01:19.069 --> 01:01:20.571
-Thank you.
-Yep.


1308
01:01:20.671 --> 01:01:21.838
Though as a working mom,

1309
01:01:21.940 --> 01:01:23.840
I would not consider that
a stable job for a child.


1310
01:01:25.342 --> 01:01:27.277
Well, that's kinda what
I wanna talk to you about.


1311
01:01:28.745 --> 01:01:31.415
What kind of a career can an
actor carve out in this city,


1312
01:01:31.515 --> 01:01:33.450
you know, without going to LA?

1313
01:01:33.550 --> 01:01:34.618
It's very tough.

1314
01:01:34.718 --> 01:01:36.853
Which leads me
to my big announcement.


1315
01:01:36.955 --> 01:01:37.922
I think she brought friends.

1316
01:01:38.022 --> 01:01:39.089
-Run!
-Ooh!


1317
01:01:39.189 --> 01:01:42.292
I love you, Chad!
We love you!


1318
01:01:45.228 --> 01:01:46.330
My agent told me

1319
01:01:46.430 --> 01:01:47.899
there's even an online petition

1320
01:01:47.999 --> 01:01:49.333
to bring Chad back.

1321
01:01:49.433 --> 01:01:50.100
No.

1322
01:01:50.200 --> 01:01:51.401
Although,

1323
01:01:51.501 --> 01:01:54.939
I did die in a horrible
dishwasher accident.


1324
01:01:55.039 --> 01:01:56.239
Wow!

1325
01:01:56.340 --> 01:01:58.442
I think we may have lost them.

1326
01:01:58.542 --> 01:02:00.177
-Okay.
-Here. Come on here.


1327
01:02:00.277 --> 01:02:01.678
I wanna tell you something.

1328
01:02:08.019 --> 01:02:09.820
Oh. Speaking of jobs,

1329
01:02:09.921 --> 01:02:12.189
my grandmother has one more
favor to ask of you.


1330
01:02:12.289 --> 01:02:13.724
-Hmm.
-She's booked a


1331
01:02:13.824 --> 01:02:16.593
dress rehearsal for the wedding.

1332
01:02:16.693 --> 01:02:19.429
A dress rehearsal? But I thought
we were having a small ceremony.


1333
01:02:19.529 --> 01:02:22.566
I mean, Rob and Tracey Jones,
that is.


1334
01:02:22.666 --> 01:02:26.436
Hmm. We are.
And that's the story.


1335
01:02:26.536 --> 01:02:29.239
It's kind of a--
like a wedding gift, I guess.


1336
01:02:29.339 --> 01:02:31.408
It's more for her really.

1337
01:02:31.508 --> 01:02:33.543
And, hey, if you're gonna have a
wedding,


1338
01:02:33.644 --> 01:02:35.779
why not have the greatest
living romance novelist


1339
01:02:35.879 --> 01:02:36.813
planning it for you?

1340
01:02:38.315 --> 01:02:39.416
Well, that's exciting.

1341
01:02:39.516 --> 01:02:40.450
Mm-hmm.

1342
01:02:40.550 --> 01:02:42.653
But I think I have you beat.

1343
01:02:42.753 --> 01:02:43.787
Really?

1344
01:02:45.322 --> 01:02:46.657
I'm not gonna be a dad anymore.

1345
01:02:47.691 --> 01:02:49.060
Oh!

1346
01:02:49.159 --> 01:02:50.293
Broke up with the waitress
already, huh?


1347
01:02:50.394 --> 01:02:53.131
The pilot, it got picked up,

1348
01:02:53.230 --> 01:02:54.698
and they want me for the lead.

1349
01:02:54.798 --> 01:02:56.000
Rob! What?

1350
01:02:57.334 --> 01:02:59.302
I have a wardrobe fitting
on Saturday.


1351
01:02:59.403 --> 01:03:00.370
We shoot here
for a couple weeks,


1352
01:03:00.470 --> 01:03:01.638
and then it's off to LA.

1353
01:03:02.806 --> 01:03:03.840
Oh, my goodness!

1354
01:03:04.942 --> 01:03:05.876
Wow! That's...

1355
01:03:07.145 --> 01:03:08.545
that's incredible.

1356
01:03:09.780 --> 01:03:12.215
But the dress rehearsal's
on Saturday.


1357
01:03:14.518 --> 01:03:17.287
Well, maybe we can postpone it.

1358
01:03:17.387 --> 01:03:19.189
Maggie's already paid
for everything.


1359
01:03:20.223 --> 01:03:21.858
But... but this is it.

1360
01:03:21.959 --> 01:03:25.228
This is my Joe Pesci moment.

1361
01:03:25.328 --> 01:03:26.730
Mm.

1362
01:03:28.966 --> 01:03:32.703
No, wait. Wait, Tracey.
I'm sure we can work it out.


1363
01:03:33.971 --> 01:03:35.839
Don't worry about it, Rob.

1364
01:03:35.940 --> 01:03:37.175
I'll figure something out.

1365
01:03:37.274 --> 01:03:38.742
No, listen, Tracey.

1366
01:03:40.877 --> 01:03:42.479
I'll call my agent.

1367
01:03:43.580 --> 01:03:46.316
We'll postpone
the wardrobe fitting.


1368
01:03:47.185 --> 01:03:48.618
I'll be there.

1369
01:03:51.888 --> 01:03:53.523
I guess that means you'll be

1370
01:03:53.623 --> 01:03:55.625
relocating to LA now, right?

1371
01:03:56.660 --> 01:04:00.497
Well, I have to for the show.

1372
01:04:02.100 --> 01:04:04.634
But Saturday,
I'll... I'll be there.


1373
01:04:04.735 --> 01:04:06.303
I... I promise.

1374
01:04:08.572 --> 01:04:10.874
One last performance, right?

1375
01:04:34.999 --> 01:04:36.266
Hi.

1376
01:04:50.047 --> 01:04:51.815
I feel like such a fool.

1377
01:04:51.916 --> 01:04:54.417
I mean, rent a groom.

1378
01:04:55.619 --> 01:04:57.487
The name says it all.

1379
01:04:59.556 --> 01:05:03.360
He plays the romantic lead
in a lot of girls' fantasies.


1380
01:05:04.795 --> 01:05:07.564
I mean, I hired him
to play that part.


1381
01:05:16.406 --> 01:05:19.709
It was fun... playing a couple.

1382
01:05:22.213 --> 01:05:23.513
I just thought it...

1383
01:05:24.548 --> 01:05:26.316
might become something more.

1384
01:05:27.350 --> 01:05:29.486
You got caught up in the show.

1385
01:05:29.586 --> 01:05:30.754
I don't blame you.

1386
01:05:30.854 --> 01:05:32.756
-Right?
-Yeah.


1387
01:05:33.757 --> 01:05:34.791
Well...

1388
01:05:35.927 --> 01:05:38.862
we just have to get
through one last performance,


1389
01:05:38.963 --> 01:05:41.798
and I can write him back
out of my life.


1390
01:05:57.048 --> 01:05:58.415
Hello, Rob.

1391
01:06:00.650 --> 01:06:01.751
Dad.

1392
01:06:03.854 --> 01:06:05.156
Been a long time.

1393
01:06:05.256 --> 01:06:06.924
There years this May.

1394
01:06:10.861 --> 01:06:11.728
You all right?

1395
01:06:11.828 --> 01:06:14.664
Yeah. Actually, 
I'm really good.

1396
01:06:16.533 --> 01:06:17.935
You had dinner?

1397
01:06:18.035 --> 01:06:19.502
I'm not staying long.

1398
01:06:20.972 --> 01:06:21.973
Drink then.

1399
01:06:23.207 --> 01:06:24.474
Sure.

1400
01:06:30.281 --> 01:06:32.549
Thank you for coming. Take care.

1401
01:06:41.458 --> 01:06:43.227
So, what are you drinkin'?

1402
01:06:43.327 --> 01:06:44.896
Club soda's just fine for me.

1403
01:06:44.996 --> 01:06:46.230
Two club sodas, please.

1404
01:06:46.330 --> 01:06:47.797
Of course.

1405
01:06:47.899 --> 01:06:50.067
Listen, I didn't come here
to fight.


1406
01:06:50.167 --> 01:06:52.435
I came here because I wanted
to tell you two things.


1407
01:06:53.337 --> 01:06:54.704
Okay.

1408
01:06:55.907 --> 01:06:56.806
First...

1409
01:06:58.309 --> 01:06:59.576
I'm an actor.

1410
01:07:01.946 --> 01:07:03.381
I know.

1411
01:07:03.480 --> 01:07:04.916
I've seen
the insurance commercial.


1412
01:07:05.016 --> 01:07:08.852
No, no, no. Not that stuff.
A real actor. I got a part.


1413
01:07:09.719 --> 01:07:12.223
A lead part in a series.

1414
01:07:12.323 --> 01:07:14.557
It's a great part.

1415
01:07:15.625 --> 01:07:17.794
It's what I've been working
for my whole life.


1416
01:07:19.429 --> 01:07:22.934
Congratulations.
I'm happy for you.


1417
01:07:24.567 --> 01:07:26.003
Here's your drinks.

1418
01:07:29.106 --> 01:07:30.041
You are?

1419
01:07:30.141 --> 01:07:31.976
Of course!

1420
01:07:32.076 --> 01:07:35.445
All I've ever asked from you
is you work hard


1421
01:07:35.545 --> 01:07:37.315
for whatever it is you want.

1422
01:07:37.415 --> 01:07:38.448
For me, it's this place,
you know?


1423
01:07:38.548 --> 01:07:41.118
I was hoping the

1424
01:07:41.218 --> 01:07:43.287
dream could be shared.

1425
01:07:43.387 --> 01:07:44.621
Turned into more of a wedge.

1426
01:07:44.721 --> 01:07:47.590
I mean, I guess you had a right
to push me away.


1427
01:07:47.691 --> 01:07:49.459
- I didn't push you away.
- Oh.


1428
01:07:49.559 --> 01:07:50.694
Three years
of the silent treatment


1429
01:07:50.794 --> 01:07:51.996
is not exactly a gentle nudge.

1430
01:07:52.096 --> 01:07:53.898
I said I didn't come here
to argue.


1431
01:07:54.798 --> 01:07:57.701
Well... why are you here?

1432
01:08:00.938 --> 01:08:03.307
I wanted to talk to you
about the ring.


1433
01:08:03.407 --> 01:08:05.109
-The ring?
-Yes.


1434
01:08:06.444 --> 01:08:07.744
Mom's ring.

1435
01:08:11.916 --> 01:08:13.050
Mom's ring.

1436
01:08:15.652 --> 01:08:17.088
I've met someone, Dad.

1437
01:08:19.823 --> 01:08:22.859
Mom's ring.
So, it's serious?


1438
01:08:22.960 --> 01:08:23.961
Yes.

1439
01:08:26.629 --> 01:08:27.797
I'm in love.

1440
01:08:30.201 --> 01:08:33.137
That look on my face
when I met your mom.


1441
01:08:34.438 --> 01:08:37.707
You are so much like her.

1442
01:08:37.807 --> 01:08:39.642
You follow your heart.

1443
01:08:40.710 --> 01:08:43.813
Oh, she would be so proud
of you right now.


1444
01:08:45.715 --> 01:08:46.850
I miss her.

1445
01:08:48.019 --> 01:08:49.552
I miss her, too.

1446
01:08:52.189 --> 01:08:56.327
Just make sure
you keep following your heart.


1447
01:08:56.427 --> 01:08:59.829
It led you through these doors.

1448
01:09:01.232 --> 01:09:05.069
Looks like it led you
into someone else's heart.


1449
01:09:07.004 --> 01:09:10.774
So, when do I get to meet her?

1450
01:09:10.874 --> 01:09:12.176
Well, if all goes well,

1451
01:09:12.276 --> 01:09:15.012
I'll need a table for two
for Saturday night.


1452
01:09:24.955 --> 01:09:25.456
Whoo!

1453
01:09:28.025 --> 01:09:30.227
Are you trying to set
a world record?


1454
01:09:30.327 --> 01:09:31.962
I'm invincible.

1455
01:09:32.063 --> 01:09:33.330
You say that now.

1456
01:09:35.366 --> 01:09:36.666
<i>Hi. My name's Trevor.</i>

1457
01:09:36.766 --> 01:09:38.402
Turn that up.

1458
01:09:38.502 --> 01:09:40.271
<i>I was once just like you,</i>
<i>not sure which insurance plan</i>


1459
01:09:40.371 --> 01:09:41.972
<i>was right for me and my family.</i>

1460
01:09:43.873 --> 01:09:45.910
<i>But now that</i>
<i>I'm with Stanfield Insurance,</i>


1461
01:09:46.010 --> 01:09:48.412
<i>we all sleep better at night.</i>

1462
01:09:48.512 --> 01:09:49.779
<i>Because in life,</i>
<i>you just never know</i>


1463
01:09:49.879 --> 01:09:52.316
<i>when to expect the unexpected.</i>

1464
01:09:54.452 --> 01:09:57.687
<i>- Stanfield Insurance.</i>
<i>- We expect the unexpected.</i>


1465
01:09:57.787 --> 01:10:01.658
Do you know that guy?
I know him, too.


1466
01:10:01.758 --> 01:10:03.860
Only his name ain't Trevor.

1467
01:10:05.029 --> 01:10:06.430
It's Brad.

1468
01:10:06.530 --> 01:10:07.764
See, a while back,

1469
01:10:07.864 --> 01:10:09.300
I was trying to get back
with my ex-girlfriend.


1470
01:10:09.400 --> 01:10:10.600
And then this guy shows up,

1471
01:10:10.700 --> 01:10:14.671
and she says
he's her fiancé. Only...


1472
01:10:14.771 --> 01:10:16.639
yeah, he wasn't.

1473
01:10:16.739 --> 01:10:19.577
Turns out, she hired this guy
to act like her fiancé.


1474
01:10:20.945 --> 01:10:22.846
They call it Rent-a-Groom.
You call them,


1475
01:10:22.947 --> 01:10:24.315
and then they show up
and ruin your life.


1476
01:10:24.415 --> 01:10:27.051
Shut up. Shut up. Shut up.
Shut up. Shut up. Shut up.


1477
01:10:31.055 --> 01:10:35.059
There!
Oh, I got you. I got you.


1478
01:10:35.159 --> 01:10:39.130
Oh, you're going down.
You're going down!


1479
01:10:40.531 --> 01:10:41.899
Okay.

1480
01:10:45.369 --> 01:10:46.337
Hey.

1481
01:10:46.437 --> 01:10:47.471
Hey.

1482
01:10:47.571 --> 01:10:48.771
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

1483
01:10:49.739 --> 01:10:51.308
What's the matter?

1484
01:10:51.408 --> 01:10:52.977
You worried about the wedding
rehearsal tomorrow?


1485
01:10:53.077 --> 01:10:55.879
Oh, no. Everything's perfect.

1486
01:10:55.980 --> 01:10:57.814
Dress was bought,
flowers are ordered.


1487
01:10:57.915 --> 01:10:59.383
My groom is leaving for LA.

1488
01:10:59.483 --> 01:11:00.584
Yeah, no.

1489
01:11:00.683 --> 01:11:02.386
Everything's going
according to plan.


1490
01:11:02.486 --> 01:11:03.686
Whoa.

1491
01:11:04.787 --> 01:11:06.357
You want him to stay?

1492
01:11:08.559 --> 01:11:10.327
I want him to want to stay.

1493
01:11:11.962 --> 01:11:14.764
So, you're upset because you
fell in love with him?


1494
01:11:14.864 --> 01:11:16.500
I fell in love with him
by mistake.


1495
01:11:16.600 --> 01:11:17.834
And that's his fault?

1496
01:11:19.003 --> 01:11:22.072
Well, now's your chance
to blast him with the truth.


1497
01:11:22.173 --> 01:11:23.374
He's in the boardroom
waiting for you.


1498
01:11:24.408 --> 01:11:25.442
Rob's here?

1499
01:11:25.543 --> 01:11:27.077
Yes.

1500
01:11:27.178 --> 01:11:28.913
Tell him, Tracey.

1501
01:11:29.013 --> 01:11:30.614
Well, what if it doesn't change
anything?


1502
01:11:30.713 --> 01:11:32.383
Well, what if it does?

1503
01:11:33.883 --> 01:11:34.884
It's called Rent-a
-Groom.

1504
01:11:34.985 --> 01:11:36.353
<i>Rent-a
-Groom?</i>

1505
01:11:36.453 --> 01:11:37.854
<i>You aren't a gigolo, are you?</i>

1506
01:11:37.955 --> 01:11:40.823
Dad, no. It's not like that.

1507
01:11:40.925 --> 01:11:43.961
People-- well, women pay me
to pretend


1508
01:11:44.061 --> 01:11:45.629
to be their love interests.

1509
01:11:45.728 --> 01:11:47.565
<i>But you say you quit.</i>

1510
01:11:47.665 --> 01:11:48.798
This morning.

1511
01:11:48.899 --> 01:11:50.901
<i>How long were you doing this?</i>

1512
01:11:51.001 --> 01:11:54.972
Three years.
Three very long years.


1513
01:11:55.973 --> 01:11:58.309
I think I've been engaged
maybe 20 times.


1514
01:11:58.409 --> 01:12:00.344
And I've had some doozies.

1515
01:12:01.912 --> 01:12:03.614
But it's finally over.

1516
01:12:03.713 --> 01:12:06.317
This endless acting.

1517
01:12:07.384 --> 01:12:09.920
You know how hard it is
to fake being madly in love?


1518
01:12:10.020 --> 01:12:12.957
I mean, I'm a good actor, but,

1519
01:12:13.057 --> 01:12:14.525
whoo.

1520
01:12:14.625 --> 01:12:16.859
And then
there's engagement party.


1521
01:12:16.961 --> 01:12:20.564
And all her little friends.
I tell you, it's agony.


1522
01:12:20.664 --> 01:12:22.933
It's just this part I'm playing.

1523
01:12:23.901 --> 01:12:25.669
It doesn't mean anything.

1524
01:12:25.768 --> 01:12:28.439
And I'm tired of pretending
that it does.


1525
01:12:33.377 --> 01:12:34.811
I can't wait to tell her.

1526
01:12:36.180 --> 01:12:39.149
I'm ready for the real thing.

1527
01:12:40.684 --> 01:12:43.820
<i>- Well, son,</i>
<i>- I think you definitely made</i>


1528
01:12:43.921 --> 01:12:45.788
<i>the right decision.</i>

1529
01:12:45.888 --> 01:12:47.124
Thanks, Dad.

1530
01:12:48.425 --> 01:12:49.727
And thanks for calling.

1531
01:12:49.826 --> 01:12:50.961
<i>Bye, son.</i>

1532
01:12:58.936 --> 01:13:02.772
<i>- Tracey, hey.</i>
<i>- I waited at the office.</i>


1533
01:13:02.872 --> 01:13:05.042
<i>Connie said you had to step out</i>
<i>to take a--</i>


1534
01:13:09.713 --> 01:13:11.915
<i>Tracey, please call me.</i>

1535
01:13:12.016 --> 01:13:14.285
<i>I'd really love to talk about--</i>

1536
01:13:18.689 --> 01:13:21.358
<i>Hey, Tracey. 
It's Rob again.</i>

1537
01:13:21.458 --> 01:13:24.662
<i>Um, I'm not sure</i>
<i>if I did something to upset you.</i>


1538
01:13:24.762 --> 01:13:27.864
<i>But, uh, if we could meet--</i>

1539
01:13:44.847 --> 01:13:46.784
Good afternoon, folks.

1540
01:13:46.917 --> 01:13:50.354
And, Maggie, you look
absolutely gorgeous.


1541
01:13:50.454 --> 01:13:52.623
Thank you, Rob. You don't look
so bad yourself.


1542
01:13:52.723 --> 01:13:55.025
Oh, well, it is a special day.

1543
01:13:56.260 --> 01:13:58.595
Have you seen Tracey?

1544
01:13:58.696 --> 01:14:00.130
Oh, no. Rob, it's...

1545
01:14:00.230 --> 01:14:02.199
bad luck to see the bride
before the wedding.


1546
01:14:02.299 --> 01:14:03.833
I don't think

1547
01:14:03.934 --> 01:14:06.303
a dress rehearsal wedding
counts, sweetheart.


1548
01:14:06.403 --> 01:14:07.471
She's inside.

1549
01:14:07.571 --> 01:14:08.871
Thank you, Maggie.

1550
01:14:08.972 --> 01:14:12.543
Well, we'll see you all
after the big moment. Oh.


1551
01:14:12.643 --> 01:14:14.144
Everything is perfect.

1552
01:14:14.244 --> 01:14:16.580
I couldn't have written
this better myself.


1553
01:14:18.415 --> 01:14:19.516
Good luck.

1554
01:14:26.023 --> 01:14:27.291
Hey. You're not supposed
to be here.


1555
01:14:27.391 --> 01:14:28.592
I'm sorry, I know.

1556
01:14:28.692 --> 01:14:29.927
Give me that.

1557
01:14:32.329 --> 01:14:35.032
You look absolutely stunning.

1558
01:14:35.966 --> 01:14:37.835
Just getting in the costume.

1559
01:14:37.935 --> 01:14:39.770
I half expected you
to send a stand-in.


1560
01:14:39.869 --> 01:14:41.405
No. I said I'd be here,
didn't I?


1561
01:14:41.505 --> 01:14:42.872
Five minutes to curtain.

1562
01:14:42.973 --> 01:14:45.476
Can I talk to you
about something?


1563
01:14:47.010 --> 01:14:47.978
There you go.

1564
01:14:48.078 --> 01:14:50.114
Getting off script again.

1565
01:14:50.214 --> 01:14:52.182
No improvising, remember?

1566
01:14:52.282 --> 01:14:54.084
Or are you directing
this show as well?


1567
01:14:55.252 --> 01:14:56.787
Places, everyone.
We can't keep Maggie waiting.


1568
01:14:56.886 --> 01:14:58.789
Well, can we talk after?

1569
01:14:58.888 --> 01:15:00.557
Just hit your mark,
and say your lines.


1570
01:15:00.657 --> 01:15:02.426
We can wrap this whole thing up.

1571
01:15:47.504 --> 01:15:48.605
Oh, my goodness.

1572
01:15:49.773 --> 01:15:51.809
I am excited...

1573
01:15:53.944 --> 01:15:55.045
...and nervous.

1574
01:15:56.046 --> 01:15:57.614
This is not my real job,
you understand?


1575
01:15:58.816 --> 01:16:01.418
But I have always wanted
to do this.


1576
01:16:01.518 --> 01:16:04.288
And when Margaret Westmoreland
asked me to preside, well--


1577
01:16:04.388 --> 01:16:05.689
Shh!

1578
01:16:08.392 --> 01:16:09.293
Hi, darling.

1579
01:16:30.013 --> 01:16:32.382
-Excited?
-Mm-hmm.


1580
01:16:32.483 --> 01:16:35.018
Dearly beloved,
we are gathered here today


1581
01:16:35.118 --> 01:16:37.754
to witness the union
of Robert Jones


1582
01:16:37.855 --> 01:16:38.856
and Tracey Westmoreland.

1583
01:16:40.657 --> 01:16:42.860
Marriage is a sacred bond.

1584
01:16:42.961 --> 01:16:47.164
A commitment to one another,
born from the seed of destiny,


1585
01:16:47.264 --> 01:16:49.733
nurtured with true love,

1586
01:16:50.935 --> 01:16:55.172
to blossom into the flower
of matrimony.


1587
01:16:56.373 --> 01:16:58.842
Before we proceed,
I must ask you both


1588
01:16:58.943 --> 01:17:01.011
if there is any impediment
to this union.


1589
01:17:01.111 --> 01:17:03.280
Actually, there is something
I'd like to say.


1590
01:17:04.214 --> 01:17:06.383
-Tracey-
-I object!


1591
01:17:11.021 --> 01:17:13.958
I object,
because this man is an actor.


1592
01:17:17.160 --> 01:17:18.562
Oh, my God. It's true.

1593
01:17:18.662 --> 01:17:20.230
I'm not really
a justice of the peace.


1594
01:17:20.330 --> 01:17:22.366
Not you, idiot. Him!

1595
01:17:22.466 --> 01:17:24.134
-Todd!
-His real name is


1596
01:17:24.234 --> 01:17:26.004
Robert J. Hollingsworth.

1597
01:17:26.103 --> 01:17:28.705
He works for an outfit
called Rent-a-Groom.


1598
01:17:28.805 --> 01:17:31.208
Tracey, what's he on about?

1599
01:17:31.308 --> 01:17:33.945
Tracey hired this guy
to fool Maggie.


1600
01:17:34.044 --> 01:17:35.612
Tracey, is this true?

1601
01:17:36.880 --> 01:17:38.815
Yes. It's true.

1602
01:17:38.917 --> 01:17:41.418
Grams, I'm so sorry.

1603
01:17:41.518 --> 01:17:44.087
I never meant for it
to go this far,


1604
01:17:44.187 --> 01:17:45.455
but now that it has,

1605
01:17:46.356 --> 01:17:47.992
I'm glad
this little charade is over.


1606
01:17:48.091 --> 01:17:51.428
Charade? Is that all
this had been to you?


1607
01:17:51.528 --> 01:17:52.496
Yeah, Rob.

1608
01:17:53.530 --> 01:17:55.365
It was just a part I'm playing.

1609
01:17:56.733 --> 01:17:57.801
It doesn't mean anything.

1610
01:17:59.102 --> 01:18:01.305
I'm tired of pretending
that it does.


1611
01:18:01.405 --> 01:18:03.140
- Hey, Tracey. Wait, wait--
- No, no, no. No, no.


1612
01:18:03.240 --> 01:18:04.675
Wait, please.

1613
01:18:06.743 --> 01:18:07.578
Tray.

1614
01:18:12.115 --> 01:18:15.987
Maggie, I am so, so truly sorry.

1615
01:18:16.086 --> 01:18:19.122
No, I'm sorry.
This is all my fault.


1616
01:18:19.222 --> 01:18:21.658
The ring
that is on Tracey's hand...


1617
01:18:22.961 --> 01:18:25.429
it belonged to my mother.

1618
01:18:25.529 --> 01:18:28.365
I was gonna give it to Tracey
for real this time.


1619
01:18:28.465 --> 01:18:32.336
But I can see now
that that's not what she wants.


1620
01:18:32.436 --> 01:18:33.670
These last few days
have been filled


1621
01:18:33.770 --> 01:18:35.006
with a few half-truths,

1622
01:18:35.105 --> 01:18:38.977
but there is one thing
that is... very real.


1623
01:18:39.077 --> 01:18:42.112
I truly love your granddaughter.

1624
01:18:50.821 --> 01:18:52.422
Walk away!

1625
01:18:56.526 --> 01:19:00.664
Maggie! Maggie!
Maggie? Maggie? Maggie?


1626
01:19:00.764 --> 01:19:01.498
Give me a hand.

1627
01:19:15.779 --> 01:19:19.216
Hey, Tray.
How's the new batch of jalopies?


1628
01:19:29.226 --> 01:19:31.194
Any word about your grandma?

1629
01:19:33.830 --> 01:19:37.634
It's been two weeks
since she collapsed.


1630
01:19:40.170 --> 01:19:42.472
Doctors are trying
to stay optimistic, but...


1631
01:19:43.941 --> 01:19:45.509
I can't help thinking...

1632
01:19:47.277 --> 01:19:48.946
I did this.

1633
01:19:49.047 --> 01:19:52.315
No, Tracey. Don't say that.

1634
01:19:52.416 --> 01:19:54.085
I thought
it would make her happy.


1635
01:19:54.217 --> 01:19:56.120
I thought...

1636
01:20:05.997 --> 01:20:07.564
It's the hospital.

1637
01:20:10.068 --> 01:20:11.268
Grandma.

1638
01:20:19.944 --> 01:20:21.545
How are you?

1639
01:20:23.014 --> 01:20:24.115
Ring.

1640
01:20:24.214 --> 01:20:25.449
Ring?

1641
01:20:26.650 --> 01:20:29.219
Oh, right, the prop ring.
I totally forgot about it.


1642
01:20:29.319 --> 01:20:32.123
Yeah. I think
I threw it in my purse.


1643
01:20:32.222 --> 01:20:34.058
You wanna see it? Yeah?

1644
01:20:34.158 --> 01:20:36.760
Okay. It should be in here
somewhere.


1645
01:20:38.795 --> 01:20:39.730
You're right.

1646
01:20:39.830 --> 01:20:41.899
I should probably mail it
back to him.


1647
01:20:41.999 --> 01:20:44.334
Or directly to the prop house
he got it from.


1648
01:20:45.970 --> 01:20:48.106
Not a prop.

1649
01:20:48.206 --> 01:20:49.506
It's real.

1650
01:20:50.874 --> 01:20:52.476
His mother's.

1651
01:20:54.979 --> 01:20:57.014
I don't understand.

1652
01:20:57.115 --> 01:20:59.750
Find his father.

1653
01:21:08.725 --> 01:21:10.460
Oh.

1654
01:21:19.237 --> 01:21:20.670
Can I help you?

1655
01:21:20.771 --> 01:21:23.040
Yes.
Are you Arthur Hollingsworth?


1656
01:21:23.141 --> 01:21:24.474
I am.

1657
01:21:24.574 --> 01:21:26.177
Mr. Hollingsworth, my name is...

1658
01:21:26.276 --> 01:21:28.112
Tracey Westmoreland.

1659
01:21:28.212 --> 01:21:29.379
Yes.

1660
01:21:29.479 --> 01:21:32.582
You look exactly
as Rob described you.


1661
01:21:34.351 --> 01:21:36.853
I think I have something
that belongs to you.


1662
01:21:41.424 --> 01:21:44.795
I've not seen that
in a long time.


1663
01:21:47.831 --> 01:21:49.599
Let's grab a seat.

1664
01:21:57.407 --> 01:21:59.843
It belonged to my wife. Lucille.

1665
01:22:02.712 --> 01:22:06.416
When she passed away,
Rob asked if he could have it.


1666
01:22:07.517 --> 01:22:08.885
He said he wanted to put it
on the finger


1667
01:22:08.986 --> 01:22:10.353
of the girl he loved.

1668
01:22:11.354 --> 01:22:12.756
I guess he found her.

1669
01:22:14.959 --> 01:22:18.628
I called him the day
before your dress rehearsal...


1670
01:22:19.964 --> 01:22:21.832
to ask him if he was sure.

1671
01:22:23.067 --> 01:22:26.503
That kid's never been more sure
of anything in his life.


1672
01:22:27.671 --> 01:22:30.841
He even quit
that Rent-a-Groom job.


1673
01:22:30.942 --> 01:22:32.143
He did?

1674
01:22:32.243 --> 01:22:34.178
That very morning.

1675
01:22:34.278 --> 01:22:36.914
He said they were parts
he was playing.


1676
01:22:37.014 --> 01:22:39.516
He was tired of pretending.

1677
01:22:40.684 --> 01:22:42.485
Said he wanted to make it real.

1678
01:22:42.586 --> 01:22:46.423
And he wanted
to make it real with you.


1679
01:22:47.992 --> 01:22:49.492
Can I ask you, Tracey...

1680
01:22:51.361 --> 01:22:52.964
why the cold feet?

1681
01:22:54.631 --> 01:22:57.834
I think I heard the wrong end
of that phone call earlier.


1682
01:23:03.540 --> 01:23:04.909
Hold onto it.

1683
01:23:08.079 --> 01:23:09.746
Thank you.

1684
01:23:14.851 --> 01:23:16.786
Aw, sweetie.

1685
01:23:19.756 --> 01:23:23.194
Well, did I miss anything
while I was away?


1686
01:23:23.294 --> 01:23:24.794
Grams.

1687
01:23:27.530 --> 01:23:29.233
Did you find his father?

1688
01:23:29.333 --> 01:23:30.268
Yes.

1689
01:23:30.368 --> 01:23:31.335
And the ring?

1690
01:23:31.434 --> 01:23:33.004
I have it.

1691
01:23:34.871 --> 01:23:38.242
Grams.
I never meant to hurt you.


1692
01:23:38.342 --> 01:23:40.144
Oh.

1693
01:23:40.244 --> 01:23:41.678
Listen, kiddo.

1694
01:23:42.712 --> 01:23:45.182
I've written enough
romance novels in my time


1695
01:23:45.283 --> 01:23:47.817
to know what true love
looks like.


1696
01:23:47.919 --> 01:23:49.786
I think I may have believed
your story


1697
01:23:49.886 --> 01:23:53.057
because you were falling
in love.


1698
01:23:53.157 --> 01:23:54.891
You can't fake that.

1699
01:23:56.760 --> 01:24:00.932
So, I have one question for you.

1700
01:24:01.032 --> 01:24:02.400
Yes?

1701
01:24:02.499 --> 01:24:06.803
Why are you still sitting here?

1702
01:24:06.904 --> 01:24:08.239
Hmm?

1703
01:24:08.339 --> 01:24:09.407
Tracey.

1704
01:24:09.506 --> 01:24:10.640
I don't know
where they're shooting,


1705
01:24:10.740 --> 01:24:12.276
but I know they wrap today.

1706
01:24:12.376 --> 01:24:14.912
-Then...
-He leaves for LA.


1707
01:24:30.061 --> 01:24:31.329
Hi.

1708
01:24:36.267 --> 01:24:37.467
Hi.

1709
01:24:38.635 --> 01:24:39.736
How did you find me?

1710
01:24:39.836 --> 01:24:41.272
Shelley told me you were here.

1711
01:24:41.372 --> 01:24:42.505
Maggie, is she all right?

1712
01:24:42.605 --> 01:24:44.474
She had an accident.

1713
01:24:44.574 --> 01:24:45.475
Right after you left
the dress rehearsal--


1714
01:24:45.575 --> 01:24:47.144
-Oh, no.
-She's all right.


1715
01:24:47.244 --> 01:24:48.478
She... she just woke up.

1716
01:24:50.647 --> 01:24:52.984
She filled me in...

1717
01:24:54.452 --> 01:24:55.752
on this.

1718
01:25:00.424 --> 01:25:01.725
I went to see your dad.

1719
01:25:02.892 --> 01:25:03.928
You did?

1720
01:25:06.663 --> 01:25:08.199
He told me everything.

1721
01:25:11.402 --> 01:25:14.005
But you're still here.

1722
01:25:14.105 --> 01:25:16.207
The show, I thought
it went to LA.


1723
01:25:16.307 --> 01:25:18.575
Yeah, it did without me.

1724
01:25:19.443 --> 01:25:20.677
I quit.

1725
01:25:20.777 --> 01:25:22.712
-But, Rob--
-Tracey.


1726
01:25:23.948 --> 01:25:25.416
I thought this was my big break,

1727
01:25:25.515 --> 01:25:28.551
but I realized
over these last few days...


1728
01:25:29.886 --> 01:25:30.887
you...

1729
01:25:32.522 --> 01:25:34.691
you've been my big break all
along.


1730
01:25:34.791 --> 01:25:37.560
And I've been racking my brain
on the drive over here


1731
01:25:37.660 --> 01:25:40.530
how to play the scene
where I run across town


1732
01:25:40.630 --> 01:25:43.666
and find the beautiful
book editor, and tell her


1733
01:25:43.767 --> 01:25:47.238
how madly in love
I am with her.


1734
01:25:50.141 --> 01:25:52.243
I think I can help you
run some lines.


1735
01:26:06.190 --> 01:26:07.690
What do I do with this?

1736
01:26:09.060 --> 01:26:10.094
Hold on to it.

1737
01:26:11.462 --> 01:26:13.264
It'll play in the later scene.
