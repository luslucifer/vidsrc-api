9
00:01:44.098 --> 00:01:46.098
Ah, thank you, thank you.

10
00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:48.167
- To the band.
- To the band.


11
00:01:48.169 --> 00:01:49.735
- To Ronnie's birthday.
- Ronnie.


12
00:01:49.737 --> 00:01:52.104
- To Ronnie.
- To Ronnie.


13
00:01:52.106 --> 00:01:55.407
Do you always celebrate
the night before?


14
00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:57.743
I was born at 3 a.m.
If I wait till tomorrow,


15
00:01:57.745 --> 00:02:00.045
by the time I wake up,
it'll have been over.


16
00:02:00.047 --> 00:02:03.015
So keep drinking
till 3:00 then?


17
00:02:03.017 --> 00:02:06.085
Can't. Things to do.

18
00:02:19.233 --> 00:02:21.266
I love you.

19
00:02:21.268 --> 00:02:23.335
I love you.

20
00:02:50.064 --> 00:02:52.531
What are you taking?

21
00:02:52.533 --> 00:02:54.400
Just a sleeping pill.

22
00:02:55.703 --> 00:02:57.236
Had a few rough nights lately.

23
00:02:57.238 --> 00:02:59.338
Why didn't you tell me?

24
00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:00.472
It doesn't matter.

25
00:03:03.644 --> 00:03:04.743
Hey.

26
00:03:10.217 --> 00:03:13.252
What's going on?

27
00:03:13.254 --> 00:03:17.790
We won't see each other
when I go on tour.


28
00:03:17.792 --> 00:03:20.559
Babe, you're a rock chick.

29
00:03:20.561 --> 00:03:23.195
This is what you do.

30
00:03:23.197 --> 00:03:25.697
I can't follow you
around the world, can I?


31
00:03:25.699 --> 00:03:30.235
And you're happy
just to keep going like this?


32
00:03:32.139 --> 00:03:33.572
What?

33
00:03:33.574 --> 00:03:35.207
Forget it.

34
00:03:37.078 --> 00:03:38.577
I'm screwing up your birthday.

35
00:03:38.579 --> 00:03:42.648
No. I wanna know
what you're talking about.


36
00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:45.250
You never stop.

37
00:03:45.252 --> 00:03:48.087
When you're working on your art,
it takes you over.


38
00:03:52.359 --> 00:03:54.860
Like some kind of beast.

39
00:03:56.263 --> 00:03:58.130
What, so this is
about me now?


40
00:03:58.132 --> 00:03:59.798
No.

41
00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:02.701
I'm the same.
Exactly the same.


42
00:04:02.703 --> 00:04:05.270
But sometimes,
it just gets to me,


43
00:04:05.272 --> 00:04:08.340
that we never have time
to be together.


44
00:04:22.556 --> 00:04:24.656
Ronnie, your scar is bleeding.

45
00:04:27.628 --> 00:04:29.895
Wow. You really
did a number on me.


46
00:04:29.897 --> 00:04:32.731
- Has it ever done that before?
- No.


47
00:04:32.733 --> 00:04:35.601
I'd better get a plaster.
Be back.


48
00:06:45.466 --> 00:06:47.699
Happy birthday, darling.

49
00:06:50.271 --> 00:06:52.004
Thank you, Mum.

50
00:06:53.641 --> 00:06:55.307
How was Lena's gig?

51
00:06:55.309 --> 00:06:57.843
Great. I'm still feeling it.

52
00:06:57.845 --> 00:07:00.445
I saw her video on YouTube
in the store.


53
00:07:00.447 --> 00:07:02.547
Yeah? What did you think?

54
00:07:02.549 --> 00:07:04.283
Amazing.

55
00:07:04.285 --> 00:07:06.285
So when do I get
to see you guys?


56
00:07:06.287 --> 00:07:07.619
We can do tonight
if you like.


57
00:07:07.621 --> 00:07:08.654
Perfect.

58
00:07:08.656 --> 00:07:10.489
I made you a cake.

59
00:07:10.491 --> 00:07:12.491
Ooh, then we're
definitely coming.


60
00:07:14.595 --> 00:07:17.896
Something happened to me
last night.


61
00:07:17.898 --> 00:07:22.334
This whole huge painting
just came to me out of nowhere.


62
00:07:22.336 --> 00:07:27.306
It only hit me afterwards
that I started at 3 a.m.


63
00:07:27.308 --> 00:07:29.441
Exactly my birthday, right?

64
00:07:29.443 --> 00:07:31.410
Mm. Can I see it?

65
00:07:31.412 --> 00:07:32.878
Yeah, sure.

66
00:07:37.851 --> 00:07:40.952
Sorry. Do you have
an IT section?


67
00:07:40.954 --> 00:07:44.523
Yes, sure, follow me.
I'll be back, Mum.


68
00:08:26.667 --> 00:08:28.800
You sure she said tonight?

69
00:08:30.537 --> 00:08:31.970
Lights are on.

70
00:08:38.846 --> 00:08:40.045
Mum?

71
00:08:41.115 --> 00:08:43.014
Mum, it's me and Lena.

72
00:08:53.961 --> 00:08:57.129
Okay, thanks.
Yeah, I hope so too.


73
00:09:00.901 --> 00:09:02.567
Can't register
as missing yet.


74
00:09:02.569 --> 00:09:04.669
She has to be gone
for 48 hours.


75
00:09:04.671 --> 00:09:06.571
<i>Hi, this is Suleka.</i>

76
00:09:06.573 --> 00:09:08.940
<i>Leave a message,
and I'll get back to you.</i>


77
00:09:27.728 --> 00:09:29.861
Mum?

78
00:09:29.863 --> 00:09:31.563
<i>Is that Ronnie?</i>

79
00:09:31.565 --> 00:09:33.698
Yeah.

80
00:09:33.700 --> 00:09:35.700
<i>You're Suleka's son, right?</i>

81
00:09:35.702 --> 00:09:37.502
Yes. Who is this?

82
00:09:37.504 --> 00:09:41.139
<i>I'm AJ, your cousin.
Your Uncle Mohan's son.</i>


83
00:09:41.141 --> 00:09:43.041
<i>I'm calling from Kolkata.</i>

84
00:09:43.043 --> 00:09:44.910
<i>Ronnie, your mother's
in hospital.</i>


85
00:09:44.912 --> 00:09:46.812
<i>She was hit by a car.</i>

86
00:09:48.148 --> 00:09:50.715
What? In Kolkata?

87
00:09:50.717 --> 00:09:52.484
<i>Well, we don't
understand either.</i>


88
00:09:52.486 --> 00:09:53.852
<i>We didn't even know
she was in India</i>


89
00:09:53.854 --> 00:09:55.053
<i>until the hospital phoned.</i>

90
00:09:55.055 --> 00:09:56.788
Is she gonna be okay?

91
00:09:56.790 --> 00:09:59.958
<i>Well, Ronnie,
she's been kept in a coma.</i>


92
00:09:59.960 --> 00:10:03.028
<i>She has a blood clot
on her lung.</i>


93
00:10:03.030 --> 00:10:06.198
Uh, okay, okay, um...

94
00:10:06.200 --> 00:10:08.900
Look, I'm gonna search
for flights right now, okay?


95
00:10:08.902 --> 00:10:10.502
<i>Tell me when
you're getting in,</i>


96
00:10:10.504 --> 00:10:11.770
<i>and I'll be there
to get you.</i>


97
00:10:11.772 --> 00:10:13.171
Okay. Thank you.

98
00:10:21.215 --> 00:10:25.083
Mum said she never wanted
to go back to India.


99
00:10:25.085 --> 00:10:27.118
She said she never wanted
to see those people again.


100
00:10:36.797 --> 00:10:38.263
Ronnie!

101
00:10:38.265 --> 00:10:40.198
Are you AJ?

102
00:10:40.200 --> 00:10:43.668
I recognized you from the photo
on your Mum's phone.


103
00:10:43.670 --> 00:10:45.070
This way.

104
00:10:48.108 --> 00:10:49.774
First time here?

105
00:10:57.150 --> 00:10:58.917
Is my mother conscious yet?

106
00:10:58.919 --> 00:11:00.752
Mm-mm.

107
00:11:22.609 --> 00:11:25.110
No, no, no, no!
They'll all come for you.


108
00:11:27.915 --> 00:11:29.881
Unintelligent behavior.

109
00:11:50.637 --> 00:11:53.905
I managed to transfer your mum
to their special ward.


110
00:12:04.751 --> 00:12:06.985
Hi, Mum.

111
00:12:06.987 --> 00:12:09.154
It's me, Ronnie.

112
00:12:16.697 --> 00:12:17.896
Yes, sir.

113
00:12:21.635 --> 00:12:23.902
Shit. Are you the son
from England?


114
00:12:23.904 --> 00:12:25.670
That's right. Ronnie.

115
00:12:25.672 --> 00:12:27.305
Dr. Multlar.

116
00:12:27.307 --> 00:12:30.208
Look, Ronnie, I've got some
really good news for you.


117
00:12:30.210 --> 00:12:32.077
Early this morning,

118
00:12:32.079 --> 00:12:34.779
we managed to break down
your mother's blood clot.


119
00:12:34.781 --> 00:12:36.615
So that means...

120
00:12:36.617 --> 00:12:38.183
That means we'll have
to keep her in this state


121
00:12:38.185 --> 00:12:39.851
for another couple of days,

122
00:12:39.853 --> 00:12:43.788
and then we have hope
that she'll recover.


123
00:12:46.660 --> 00:12:49.194
Look, this is the time
when she needs to bathe her,


124
00:12:49.196 --> 00:12:52.998
and we also need
to run some tests, so...


125
00:12:54.234 --> 00:12:56.267
Doctor...

126
00:13:16.356 --> 00:13:19.057
So there's Latta, AJ's wife,

127
00:13:19.059 --> 00:13:21.359
and their kid Juma.

128
00:13:21.361 --> 00:13:22.394
Juma's really sweet, actually.

129
00:13:22.396 --> 00:13:24.663
<i>Really? How old is she?</i>

130
00:13:24.665 --> 00:13:26.665
I think 5 or 6.

131
00:13:26.667 --> 00:13:29.167
And AJ's dad lives here.

132
00:13:29.169 --> 00:13:31.069
Mohan.
Mum's older brother.


133
00:13:31.071 --> 00:13:32.937
<i>Is he the one who treated
your mum so badly?</i>


134
00:13:32.939 --> 00:13:35.273
Yeah. He's barely
said hello so far.


135
00:13:37.444 --> 00:13:39.944
I think dinner's ready.
I'll call you later.


136
00:13:39.946 --> 00:13:42.080
<i>I'm so glad to hear
your mum's doing better.</i>


137
00:13:42.082 --> 00:13:43.782
<i>Please send her my love.</i>

138
00:14:24.391 --> 00:14:26.057
It's a conch, you know?

139
00:14:26.059 --> 00:14:29.761
We blow it to ward off
evil spirits.


140
00:14:29.763 --> 00:14:33.164
Why your mother
doesn't do puja?


141
00:14:33.166 --> 00:14:36.034
She doesn't really keep up
with those traditions.


142
00:14:37.137 --> 00:14:39.370
So when she's better,

143
00:14:39.372 --> 00:14:41.940
you think you will be exploring
Kolkata with her?


144
00:14:41.942 --> 00:14:46.044
I expect she'll want to
get back to London in a hurry.


145
00:14:48.982 --> 00:14:50.815
Depends if she's up to it.

146
00:14:50.817 --> 00:14:52.751
- This is delicious.
- Thank you.


147
00:14:52.753 --> 00:14:56.354
This is ilish macher bhapa.
Did you have it before?


148
00:14:56.356 --> 00:14:59.791
No. I don't think I've ever
seen it on a restaurant menu.


149
00:14:59.793 --> 00:15:01.359
We mostly cook it at home.

150
00:15:01.361 --> 00:15:02.861
I don't think Ronnie's mother

151
00:15:02.863 --> 00:15:04.896
will cook something
like this at home.


152
00:15:04.898 --> 00:15:06.898
Why are you so sure of that?

153
00:15:08.235 --> 00:15:10.301
'Cause you said
she isn't interested


154
00:15:10.303 --> 00:15:11.536
in Bengali traditions.

155
00:15:11.538 --> 00:15:14.105
Oh.

156
00:15:14.107 --> 00:15:16.107
Well, whose fault is that?

157
00:15:17.444 --> 00:15:19.144
Uncle Mohan?

158
00:15:22.783 --> 00:15:24.916
What do you mean?

159
00:15:24.918 --> 00:15:27.352
What do you think I mean?

160
00:15:27.354 --> 00:15:29.387
Making these digs
at my mother,


161
00:15:29.389 --> 00:15:32.190
like she should be sorry
for leaving India.


162
00:15:32.192 --> 00:15:35.326
She didn't abandon you.
You abandoned her.


163
00:15:35.328 --> 00:15:37.529
What are you talking about?

164
00:15:37.531 --> 00:15:39.798
Please excuse us.

165
00:15:39.800 --> 00:15:41.399
Come.

166
00:15:49.376 --> 00:15:51.309
My mum married for love

167
00:15:51.311 --> 00:15:55.280
and apparently the man she loved
was the wrong caste.


168
00:15:55.282 --> 00:15:58.850
So your dad here
cut her dead.


169
00:15:58.852 --> 00:16:00.919
Even when my father died,

170
00:16:00.921 --> 00:16:03.321
and my mum was left
pregnant and alone,


171
00:16:03.323 --> 00:16:06.457
your dad shut the door
in her face.


172
00:16:06.459 --> 00:16:09.294
That's why she ran
to London to have me.


173
00:16:18.338 --> 00:16:21.940
Ronnie, who told you that?

174
00:16:21.942 --> 00:16:24.843
My mum.
Who do you think?


175
00:16:31.218 --> 00:16:32.417
What's this?

176
00:16:34.187 --> 00:16:39.991
This was taken on
your parents' wedding day.


177
00:16:39.993 --> 00:16:42.093
That's my dad there.

178
00:16:44.397 --> 00:16:47.332
And this one is you...

179
00:16:47.334 --> 00:16:50.401
in your parents'
Kolkata house.


180
00:17:04.150 --> 00:17:06.451
- Did you tell him I'm sorry?
- Yeah.


181
00:17:06.453 --> 00:17:09.454
But this is what he's like
when he's upset.


182
00:17:09.456 --> 00:17:11.189
He shuts everyone out.

183
00:17:12.325 --> 00:17:15.093
Hey, Ronnie,

184
00:17:15.095 --> 00:17:16.628
you smoke ganja?

185
00:17:17.931 --> 00:17:18.930
I can't understand why my mum

186
00:17:18.932 --> 00:17:21.532
made up all these lies.

187
00:17:21.534 --> 00:17:24.002
Maybe she lost it
after my father died.


188
00:17:29.242 --> 00:17:30.541
Ronnie...

189
00:17:33.980 --> 00:17:37.081
Your dad was still alive
when your mum left India.


190
00:17:38.285 --> 00:17:39.350
What?

191
00:17:41.354 --> 00:17:45.123
My dad said he would come around
asking all the time


192
00:17:45.125 --> 00:17:46.991
if we had heard from her.

193
00:17:46.993 --> 00:17:48.993
But I was just a kid, man.
I don't remember much.


194
00:17:48.995 --> 00:17:56.067
Wait. You're saying that my mum
left my dad here?


195
00:17:56.069 --> 00:17:58.937
I think after about
four or five years,


196
00:17:58.939 --> 00:18:01.606
he just stopped looking.

197
00:18:03.476 --> 00:18:07.512
I guess if he died,
it would have been later.


198
00:18:10.583 --> 00:18:14.419
Meaning he might still
be alive?


199
00:18:16.256 --> 00:18:18.656
You need to talk
to your mum, man.


200
00:18:56.162 --> 00:18:59.263
Mum? Mum? Hey!

201
00:18:59.265 --> 00:19:01.299
It's me.

202
00:19:01.301 --> 00:19:03.468
I'm so glad you're okay.

203
00:19:04.771 --> 00:19:07.171
Where am I?

204
00:19:08.208 --> 00:19:09.574
You're in a hospital, Mum.

205
00:19:09.576 --> 00:19:12.610
But you're gonna be fine.

206
00:19:12.612 --> 00:19:14.212
You're in Kolkata.

207
00:19:20.120 --> 00:19:22.120
- Ronnie.
- Yeah?


208
00:19:22.122 --> 00:19:24.589
You need to go.

209
00:19:24.591 --> 00:19:27.158
We'll leave as soon as
you're better, Mum, okay?


210
00:19:27.160 --> 00:19:30.328
No. Go now.

211
00:19:30.330 --> 00:19:33.064
Why?

212
00:19:34.334 --> 00:19:36.067
She's coming.

213
00:19:36.069 --> 00:19:37.201
Who is?

214
00:19:39.539 --> 00:19:41.606
Ronnie?

215
00:19:41.608 --> 00:19:44.042
It's okay, Mum, it's okay.
It's just a power cut.


216
00:19:44.044 --> 00:19:45.810
No, Ronnie, you need to go!

217
00:19:45.812 --> 00:19:48.246
You need to leave India. Go!

218
00:19:48.248 --> 00:19:50.081
Mum, I'm not gonna leave
without you, okay?


219
00:19:50.083 --> 00:19:52.617
- Go! Go! Go!
- Mum, Mum, I'm--


220
00:19:52.619 --> 00:19:55.119
Excuse me, my mum's
having some kind of fit.


221
00:19:55.121 --> 00:19:56.421
Can you please
come and help?


222
00:19:56.423 --> 00:19:58.523
Excuse me, sir,
I'm busy now, please.


223
00:20:00.060 --> 00:20:02.260
Nurse, I'm sorry
to bother you,


224
00:20:02.262 --> 00:20:04.295
but my mum is having
some kind of fit.


225
00:20:04.297 --> 00:20:06.664
Excuse me,
that patient needs help.


226
00:20:06.666 --> 00:20:08.099
I'll come in a minute.

227
00:20:44.137 --> 00:20:46.604
Mum. Mum?

228
00:20:53.713 --> 00:20:55.480
Help me!

229
00:21:05.859 --> 00:21:08.426
One of the last things
my mother said


230
00:21:08.428 --> 00:21:10.428
was that "she was coming."

231
00:21:10.430 --> 00:21:14.632
And you think she meant
this woman in the purple sari?


232
00:21:14.634 --> 00:21:18.169
Well, she didn't kill
your mother.


233
00:21:18.171 --> 00:21:21.539
She couldn't have made it
to the ground level so fast.


234
00:21:21.541 --> 00:21:24.408
Probably she was some
beggar woman passing by.


235
00:21:24.410 --> 00:21:27.612
What about the symbol she drew
in my mother's blood?


236
00:21:27.614 --> 00:21:30.314
Who knows?

237
00:21:30.316 --> 00:21:32.250
Maybe she was just a crazy.

238
00:21:35.321 --> 00:21:38.923
You know, you can't really
push someone from here.


239
00:21:38.925 --> 00:21:41.592
You have to pick them up
and then throw them down.


240
00:21:50.503 --> 00:21:51.702
Thanks.

241
00:21:59.679 --> 00:22:02.313
Your mother was here because
she ran in front of a car.


242
00:22:06.819 --> 00:22:08.819
My mother would never
kill herself.


243
00:22:08.821 --> 00:22:11.689
I talk to her every day.
She never said anything.


244
00:22:11.691 --> 00:22:14.926
I'm afraid they often don't.

245
00:22:14.928 --> 00:22:16.427
I'm sorry.

246
00:25:02.962 --> 00:25:04.028
What's this?

247
00:25:05.832 --> 00:25:07.498
It'll protect you.

248
00:25:09.535 --> 00:25:10.601
From what?

249
00:25:10.603 --> 00:25:13.104
They say it takes 13 days

250
00:25:13.106 --> 00:25:15.406
for your mother's soul
to leave this place.


251
00:25:15.408 --> 00:25:16.774
And in that time,

252
00:25:16.776 --> 00:25:19.643
her soul is attracted
towards her loved ones.


253
00:25:27.120 --> 00:25:28.786
Who's that?

254
00:25:41.701 --> 00:25:46.103
Excuse me, did you know
my mother, Suleka?


255
00:25:47.840 --> 00:25:49.840
You are her son?

256
00:25:52.845 --> 00:25:54.812
I am very sorry.

257
00:25:54.814 --> 00:25:57.515
It was me.

258
00:25:57.517 --> 00:25:59.417
I did this.

259
00:25:59.419 --> 00:26:03.687
I hit your mother with my car.

260
00:26:03.689 --> 00:26:07.057
I called the hospital
to know how she was doing,


261
00:26:07.059 --> 00:26:09.493
but they said she was...

262
00:26:14.734 --> 00:26:18.469
Do you think she ran in front
of your car deliberately?


263
00:26:18.471 --> 00:26:23.574
It was like she was
running away from someone.


264
00:26:30.616 --> 00:26:32.783
Where did this happen?

265
00:27:04.016 --> 00:27:05.783
Are we here?

266
00:27:10.122 --> 00:27:11.589
Okay.

267
00:27:57.103 --> 00:28:00.070
Do you remember this woman?

268
00:28:08.548 --> 00:28:09.680
Girlfriend?

269
00:28:11.217 --> 00:28:13.684
Accident.
Run over last week.


270
00:28:20.760 --> 00:28:22.893
What the hell is this, huh?

271
00:28:22.895 --> 00:28:25.262
Where from, sweetie?

272
00:28:25.264 --> 00:28:26.830
London.

273
00:28:26.832 --> 00:28:28.832
Hey, hey, London!

274
00:28:33.773 --> 00:28:35.673
- No, sorry.
- Drink, drink!


275
00:28:35.675 --> 00:28:38.809
- I'm sorry.
- Yeah, come, sweetie, come.


276
00:28:38.811 --> 00:28:40.644
Good, thank you.
Good morning.


277
00:28:43.115 --> 00:28:45.182
Excuse me.

278
00:28:45.184 --> 00:28:47.885
Have you seen this woman?

279
00:28:47.887 --> 00:28:50.220
She was here last--

280
00:28:56.963 --> 00:28:58.262
Excuse me.

281
00:29:01.601 --> 00:29:05.235
Sorry. Have you--
Have you seen this woman?


282
00:29:48.814 --> 00:29:51.315
Did you see her?

283
00:29:51.317 --> 00:29:52.883
Accident.

284
00:29:54.320 --> 00:29:55.719
Car?

285
00:29:55.721 --> 00:29:58.656
Hey, mister, where you from?

286
00:29:58.658 --> 00:30:00.758
Where are you from, mister?

287
00:30:00.760 --> 00:30:03.293
You England?

288
00:30:03.295 --> 00:30:04.428
Yes.

289
00:30:04.430 --> 00:30:06.263
Alistair Cook,

290
00:30:06.265 --> 00:30:08.732
Steven Peterson,

291
00:30:08.734 --> 00:30:10.234
and David Beckham.

292
00:30:11.904 --> 00:30:14.171
Give me English money.

293
00:30:14.173 --> 00:30:15.406
Uh, I don't have any.

294
00:30:15.408 --> 00:30:19.076
Yes, English money
in pocket, deep.


295
00:30:19.078 --> 00:30:20.110
Pocket, pocket.

296
00:30:21.747 --> 00:30:23.147
Mister!

297
00:30:25.251 --> 00:30:28.185
Mister! Wait, mister!

298
00:30:28.187 --> 00:30:30.454
Did you love your mother?

299
00:30:38.764 --> 00:30:39.863
Did you see her?

300
00:30:39.865 --> 00:30:42.132
Give me English money.

301
00:30:50.843 --> 00:30:55.212
I saw her three night ago.

302
00:30:55.214 --> 00:30:59.917
She was running away
from the spirit house.


303
00:31:00.920 --> 00:31:02.352
The what?

304
00:31:02.354 --> 00:31:04.755
Spirit house.

305
00:33:26.065 --> 00:33:27.331
Ah.

306
00:33:38.911 --> 00:33:42.079
Um, my name is Ronnie.

307
00:33:45.351 --> 00:33:48.485
This is my mother Suleka.

308
00:33:48.487 --> 00:33:50.587
She died last night.

309
00:33:52.258 --> 00:33:55.292
No. I'm not here for this.

310
00:33:55.294 --> 00:33:57.227
My mother came here
before she was run over.


311
00:34:19.451 --> 00:34:21.084
She was here, wasn't she?

312
00:34:22.254 --> 00:34:24.588
No. Now you go.

313
00:34:28.661 --> 00:34:30.661
My mother was hit by a car
near here.


314
00:34:30.663 --> 00:34:32.596
Someone was chasing--

315
00:34:38.437 --> 00:34:40.671
You recognize her,
don't you?


316
00:34:40.673 --> 00:34:43.307
Why was she here?

317
00:34:43.309 --> 00:34:45.475
Your mother--

318
00:35:01.627 --> 00:35:03.694
No! I didn't do anything!
I didn't do anything!


319
00:35:03.696 --> 00:35:05.329
Get off of me!
Get off of me!


320
00:35:26.585 --> 00:35:28.151
What the fuck?

321
00:35:56.782 --> 00:35:59.182
A place like that
is bad news, man.


322
00:35:59.184 --> 00:36:00.283
You shouldn't be
going there.


323
00:36:00.285 --> 00:36:01.752
Then why was my mother there?

324
00:36:01.754 --> 00:36:03.320
You know this for certain, huh?

325
00:36:03.322 --> 00:36:07.691
They recognized the photo,
I'm sure of it.


326
00:36:07.693 --> 00:36:09.659
She's the last person in the
world to believe in that crap.


327
00:36:09.661 --> 00:36:12.462
Ronnie, why can't you just
let the police handle this?


328
00:36:12.464 --> 00:36:16.033
Then they'll think she was
crazy enough to kill herself.


329
00:36:23.776 --> 00:36:25.642
Can I have one?

330
00:36:36.088 --> 00:36:38.121
What's going on?

331
00:36:38.123 --> 00:36:40.690
Durga Puja
starts in a few days.


332
00:36:40.692 --> 00:36:44.261
Biggest festival in the city.
This place gets insane, man.


333
00:36:44.263 --> 00:36:47.497
All these streets along here,
all gonna be transformed.


334
00:37:50.529 --> 00:37:52.295
Wow.

335
00:37:52.297 --> 00:37:54.364
You really captured
Mahishasura.


336
00:37:54.366 --> 00:37:55.765
Hey.

337
00:37:55.767 --> 00:37:57.501
So who is he?

338
00:37:57.503 --> 00:37:58.835
He's a Rakshasa.

339
00:37:58.837 --> 00:38:00.203
A demon king.

340
00:38:00.205 --> 00:38:01.438
May I?

341
00:38:03.408 --> 00:38:06.743
He wanted to bring
apocalypse on Earth


342
00:38:06.745 --> 00:38:10.213
until Durgamma defeated him.

343
00:38:19.892 --> 00:38:22.592
You ever had a paan?

344
00:38:22.594 --> 00:38:23.927
What's a paan?

345
00:38:23.929 --> 00:38:26.730
"What's a paan?"

346
00:38:26.732 --> 00:38:28.665
I'll be right back.

347
00:41:29.514 --> 00:41:31.414
Hello?

348
00:41:53.071 --> 00:41:55.438
So you never saw
this woman leave?


349
00:41:55.440 --> 00:41:58.108
She just led you
to this young girl's body


350
00:41:58.110 --> 00:42:00.110
and then vanished?

351
00:42:00.112 --> 00:42:01.845
Yes.

352
00:42:01.847 --> 00:42:05.715
You say your cousin
was with you on the street.


353
00:42:05.717 --> 00:42:08.952
Did he see this woman
in the purple sari?


354
00:42:08.954 --> 00:42:12.622
No. He was buying...
something.


355
00:42:14.493 --> 00:42:17.527
She's been dead
for about three days now, sir.


356
00:42:17.529 --> 00:42:20.764
The killer tied her up,
then cut her throat.


357
00:42:20.766 --> 00:42:23.700
Okay. Take her out,
but keep her covered.


358
00:42:23.702 --> 00:42:26.136
There's a crowd out there.

359
00:42:26.138 --> 00:42:27.737
Okay.

360
00:42:30.809 --> 00:42:33.743
How long have you been
in Kolkata?


361
00:42:33.745 --> 00:42:35.178
Three days.

362
00:42:36.848 --> 00:42:38.948
What are you implying?

363
00:42:38.950 --> 00:42:43.753
Right now, the only thing that
links these two bodies is you.


364
00:42:43.755 --> 00:42:47.690
And the symbols, both painted
with the victims' blood.


365
00:42:49.094 --> 00:42:50.593
Excuse me a second.

366
00:42:51.730 --> 00:42:53.129
Asha.

367
00:42:56.668 --> 00:42:58.101
Yes, sir.

368
00:43:05.544 --> 00:43:06.976
So the police called,

369
00:43:06.978 --> 00:43:09.813
wanting to confirm
when you arrived in India.


370
00:43:09.815 --> 00:43:11.648
They can't accuse me
of killing that girl.


371
00:43:11.650 --> 00:43:13.016
I wasn't even here.

372
00:43:13.018 --> 00:43:15.452
You don't understand
how it works here.


373
00:43:15.454 --> 00:43:18.555
The police are under a lot
of pressure to make arrests,


374
00:43:18.557 --> 00:43:20.223
especially with
a young girl like this.


375
00:43:20.225 --> 00:43:22.492
Look, bhai,

376
00:43:22.494 --> 00:43:24.761
don't take this the wrong way,

377
00:43:24.763 --> 00:43:26.830
but you should
go back to England


378
00:43:26.832 --> 00:43:30.834
before they come
after you, yeah?


379
00:43:30.836 --> 00:43:33.603
If you need anything,
call me.


380
00:43:53.124 --> 00:43:55.592
- Hello?
<i>- Hi, Ronnie.</i>


381
00:43:55.594 --> 00:43:58.528
<i>This is Asha,
the police photographer.</i>


382
00:43:58.530 --> 00:44:01.231
<i>Can you meet me at Elgin House?
At the murder scene.</i>


383
00:44:02.901 --> 00:44:05.702
I knew they were the same.
Last night.


384
00:44:05.704 --> 00:44:08.505
No. Do you know
Bengali numbers?


385
00:44:09.875 --> 00:44:14.110
The one next to your mom's body
was a six.


386
00:44:15.180 --> 00:44:17.080
That's a seven.

387
00:44:17.082 --> 00:44:20.183
I think the killer
is numbering them.


388
00:44:20.185 --> 00:44:23.686
But they're in the wrong order.
This girl was killed first.


389
00:45:04.696 --> 00:45:07.163
Nothing on her cousin?

390
00:45:07.165 --> 00:45:09.098
She said she was
murdered in 1987.


391
00:45:09.100 --> 00:45:10.867
That's a long time ago.

392
00:45:10.869 --> 00:45:14.203
If he's killed before,
police must have a file on him.


393
00:45:14.205 --> 00:45:15.939
Let's ask Banerji.

394
00:45:15.941 --> 00:45:17.941
No, I don't think we should
involve him in this


395
00:45:17.943 --> 00:45:20.977
until we know something more,

396
00:45:20.979 --> 00:45:24.948
not when... you're still
under investigation.


397
00:45:27.953 --> 00:45:30.620
Then why are you helping me?

398
00:45:30.622 --> 00:45:32.622
Because I know
you didn't kill your mum.


399
00:45:35.694 --> 00:45:37.226
I have another idea.

400
00:45:40.332 --> 00:45:41.864
Thank you.

401
00:45:51.376 --> 00:45:53.776
Zero, zero, one...

402
00:45:56.214 --> 00:45:58.114
October 1987.

403
00:46:01.186 --> 00:46:03.620
<i>Another ritual killing
last night,</i>


404
00:46:03.622 --> 00:46:05.822
<i>- student Anadi Dapur.</i>
<i>-</i> That's her cousin.


405
00:46:05.824 --> 00:46:08.358
<i>She is the sixth victim
in as many days.</i>


406
00:46:08.360 --> 00:46:12.261
<i>A series of killings the police
now say are definitely linked.</i>


407
00:46:22.841 --> 00:46:23.840
Wait.

408
00:46:29.214 --> 00:46:30.947
It's here.

409
00:46:35.320 --> 00:46:38.054
It's a two.

410
00:46:38.056 --> 00:46:40.657
They said this was
the sixth victim.


411
00:46:40.659 --> 00:46:42.058
Yep.

412
00:46:44.129 --> 00:46:45.294
Wait.

413
00:47:00.745 --> 00:47:02.879
The numbers are counting down.

414
00:47:05.717 --> 00:47:08.317
What are they counting down to?

415
00:47:10.822 --> 00:47:13.222
<i>The seventh night,
the seventh victim.</i>


416
00:47:13.224 --> 00:47:14.957
<i>But this one survived</i>

417
00:47:14.959 --> 00:47:18.227
<i>after a police officer
heard her cries for help.</i>


418
00:47:25.203 --> 00:47:28.237
He's saying he shot the attacker
in the shoulder.


419
00:47:30.308 --> 00:47:32.308
He escaped
through that window.


420
00:47:37.749 --> 00:47:40.349
So he might still be alive.

421
00:47:41.486 --> 00:47:44.087
It can't be the same killer.

422
00:47:44.089 --> 00:47:46.823
They shot him.

423
00:47:46.825 --> 00:47:50.393
And it was, what,

424
00:47:53.732 --> 00:47:55.131
What?

425
00:47:56.935 --> 00:47:59.302
That's when my mother
left India.


426
00:48:12.083 --> 00:48:13.116
Mum?

427
00:48:52.290 --> 00:48:53.489
Hello?

428
00:49:00.098 --> 00:49:01.497
Juma.

429
00:49:10.875 --> 00:49:13.209
Daddy's dead! Daddy's dead!

430
00:49:13.211 --> 00:49:15.211
What did you say?
Juma, it's okay.


431
00:49:15.213 --> 00:49:16.846
Juma, it's all right.

432
00:49:16.848 --> 00:49:18.381
I just walked in.
She just started screaming.


433
00:49:18.383 --> 00:49:19.382
Juma?

434
00:49:22.954 --> 00:49:24.987
- Daddy's dead!
- You're dreaming.


435
00:49:27.058 --> 00:49:29.392
No, see?
He's right here.


436
00:49:37.335 --> 00:49:40.102
Daddy's lying there.
Daddy's dead.


437
00:49:46.978 --> 00:49:47.977
AJ.

438
00:49:48.980 --> 00:49:50.546
AJ.

439
00:49:50.548 --> 00:49:52.148
Is that a Bengali number?

440
00:49:53.852 --> 00:49:55.551
Yes, that's a three.

441
00:49:57.088 --> 00:49:58.087
What is it?

442
00:49:59.190 --> 00:50:01.157
You know the symbol...

443
00:50:01.159 --> 00:50:03.526
painted at the murders?

444
00:50:03.528 --> 00:50:06.262
This is it.

445
00:50:06.264 --> 00:50:08.264
How could Juma know that?

446
00:50:08.266 --> 00:50:09.932
Daddy!

447
00:50:09.934 --> 00:50:12.068
Coming, Juma.

448
00:50:14.439 --> 00:50:16.973
Ronnie.

449
00:50:16.975 --> 00:50:19.342
We need to talk.

450
00:50:19.344 --> 00:50:22.478
Our parents died
on the same day.


451
00:50:22.480 --> 00:50:24.947
Did your mother
tell you that?


452
00:50:26.117 --> 00:50:27.450
Father had a stroke,

453
00:50:27.452 --> 00:50:30.152
and my mother willed herself
to go with him.


454
00:50:30.154 --> 00:50:34.624
And just like that,
we were orphans.


455
00:50:34.626 --> 00:50:37.226
And, uh...

456
00:50:37.228 --> 00:50:39.428
we started attending séances.

457
00:50:39.430 --> 00:50:40.997
We?

458
00:50:42.033 --> 00:50:44.033
You mean my mother went too?

459
00:50:47.305 --> 00:50:49.639
She didn't want to go
at first.


460
00:50:51.542 --> 00:50:53.376
I talked her into it.

461
00:50:53.378 --> 00:50:55.912
We were still teenagers.

462
00:50:55.914 --> 00:50:59.181
I was scared to go alone,
so I made her come with me...


463
00:50:59.183 --> 00:51:01.550
to the Spirit House.

464
00:51:03.488 --> 00:51:06.122
The Spirit House?

465
00:51:10.528 --> 00:51:12.995
In Khalside?

466
00:51:12.996 --> 00:51:15.463
The medium in Khalside
was a woman called Rakhee.


467
00:51:16.935 --> 00:51:19.101
- Very powerful.
- Wait.


468
00:51:19.103 --> 00:51:21.637
- Why are you telling me this?
- Please listen.


469
00:51:23.308 --> 00:51:25.441
Just listen to me.

470
00:51:31.049 --> 00:51:34.550
The legend was,
as a child,


471
00:51:34.552 --> 00:51:39.689
Rakhee worked the bars
in Nimdala...


472
00:51:39.691 --> 00:51:42.992
until one day,
she was very badly burnt.


473
00:51:44.395 --> 00:51:46.362
From that moment,

474
00:51:46.364 --> 00:51:49.165
the spirits
started speaking to her


475
00:51:49.167 --> 00:51:51.067
once they left the bodies

476
00:51:51.069 --> 00:51:53.135
My mum has never believed
in any of this.


477
00:51:55.573 --> 00:51:58.040
After a while,

478
00:51:58.042 --> 00:52:03.546
I realized Rakhee
was very bad news,


479
00:52:03.548 --> 00:52:06.449
so I stopped going
to see her.


480
00:52:07.752 --> 00:52:10.186
But my mother
didn't stop going.


481
00:52:15.326 --> 00:52:17.727
She became addicted to it.

482
00:52:17.729 --> 00:52:19.562
The séances.

483
00:52:19.564 --> 00:52:21.697
She couldn't stop.

484
00:52:21.699 --> 00:52:23.766
Rakhee had a great power
over her.


485
00:52:23.768 --> 00:52:27.636
That's why I think Suleka
went to Khalside this week.


486
00:52:27.638 --> 00:52:30.573
No.

487
00:52:30.575 --> 00:52:33.442
It doesn't make any sense.

488
00:52:33.444 --> 00:52:35.444
Why would my mother
come all this way


489
00:52:35.446 --> 00:52:37.713
to find some crazy medium?

490
00:52:37.715 --> 00:52:41.384
Why now after so long?

491
00:52:42.653 --> 00:52:45.321
I have no idea,

492
00:52:45.323 --> 00:52:47.757
but I think it's a good idea
that you're going away


493
00:52:47.759 --> 00:52:51.227
before anything happens to us.

494
00:52:51.229 --> 00:52:53.562
Did you tell the police
about this Rakhee?


495
00:52:53.564 --> 00:52:55.498
Maybe they might wanna
speak to her.


496
00:52:55.500 --> 00:52:58.134
No. Your mother is gone.

497
00:53:01.372 --> 00:53:03.406
What did this Rakhee
look like?


498
00:53:05.410 --> 00:53:08.611
She always wore a purple sari.

499
00:55:34.192 --> 00:55:37.927
Why did mum lie to me
about everything?


500
00:55:37.929 --> 00:55:39.929
I don't know.

501
00:55:39.931 --> 00:55:41.897
My birth,

502
00:55:41.899 --> 00:55:43.933
why she left India,

503
00:55:43.935 --> 00:55:45.834
my dad.

504
00:55:45.836 --> 00:55:47.670
I mean, fuck knows
what's actually true about him.


505
00:55:47.672 --> 00:55:48.904
<i>Look, Ronnie,</i>

506
00:55:48.906 --> 00:55:50.806
don't worry about
any of that now.


507
00:55:50.808 --> 00:55:53.842
Just come back,
and we'll talk it all through.


508
00:55:56.380 --> 00:55:58.747
I just wish I just knew
why she came back here.


509
00:56:00.551 --> 00:56:01.617
No.

510
00:56:05.690 --> 00:56:06.722
Hold on.

511
00:56:15.233 --> 00:56:16.265
There you go.

512
00:56:19.737 --> 00:56:22.371
Sorry about that.

513
00:56:22.373 --> 00:56:23.505
Lena.

514
00:56:24.775 --> 00:56:25.774
Lena?

515
00:56:34.418 --> 00:56:37.786
- Can I have the passport, sir?
- Yeah. Uh, London.


516
00:56:37.788 --> 00:56:39.321
Thank you, sir.

517
00:56:40.891 --> 00:56:42.324
Thank you.

518
00:56:47.665 --> 00:56:49.665
Thank you, sir.

519
00:56:49.667 --> 00:56:51.600
Are you okay, sir?

520
00:56:51.602 --> 00:56:52.968
I'm fine.

521
00:56:52.970 --> 00:56:54.937
If you have a laptop,
take it out of your bags


522
00:56:54.939 --> 00:56:57.740
and put it on the tray
in front of you.


523
00:56:57.742 --> 00:56:58.974
All of your keys and wallets

524
00:56:58.976 --> 00:57:01.844
should be in the tray
in front of you.


525
00:57:13.891 --> 00:57:15.491
Are you okay, sir?

526
00:57:15.493 --> 00:57:19.561
Sorry, excuse me.

527
00:58:10.981 --> 00:58:13.649
Fuck.

528
00:58:31.001 --> 00:58:34.636
My passport was in my bag, too,
including my phone.


529
00:58:34.638 --> 00:58:37.072
Okay. Why don't you
come into our office,


530
00:58:37.074 --> 00:58:38.841
and we can take a description
of the man and then--


531
00:58:38.843 --> 00:58:41.543
But my flight's closing.

532
00:58:41.545 --> 00:58:43.946
You're not getting
onto that flight, sir.


533
00:58:46.851 --> 00:58:49.385
I'm sorry to ask you.

534
00:58:49.387 --> 00:58:51.387
My uncle doesn't want me
at the house.


535
00:58:51.389 --> 00:58:53.789
You wait there.
I'll be coming.


536
00:58:53.791 --> 00:58:55.691
<i>Thank you, Asha.</i>

537
00:58:55.693 --> 00:58:56.725
No problem.

538
00:59:58.823 --> 01:00:00.022
Oh.

539
01:00:02.026 --> 01:00:04.059
Your clothes are probably dry.
One second.


540
01:00:04.061 --> 01:00:06.228
What happened?

541
01:00:06.230 --> 01:00:08.630
You passed out.

542
01:00:08.632 --> 01:00:10.599
I'm afraid you got sick
on your clothes,


543
01:00:10.601 --> 01:00:13.635
so I rinsed them.

544
01:00:13.637 --> 01:00:14.937
Here.

545
01:00:17.675 --> 01:00:19.808
How are you feeling now?

546
01:00:21.145 --> 01:00:22.244
Better.

547
01:00:22.246 --> 01:00:24.980
Thank you.

548
01:00:24.982 --> 01:00:27.916
I'll let you get dressed.
Sorry.


549
01:00:29.587 --> 01:00:31.787
This little girl
sold me a bottle of water.


550
01:00:31.789 --> 01:00:33.989
It's like she had me
marked out.


551
01:00:33.991 --> 01:00:36.825
It's a hard country
for people like you.


552
01:00:36.827 --> 01:00:38.594
Anything can take you down.

553
01:00:38.596 --> 01:00:42.798
But a man stole my bag,
passport, everything.


554
01:00:42.800 --> 01:00:46.268
I was puking up,
and he was there waiting.


555
01:00:49.039 --> 01:00:51.073
I sound completely paranoid,
right?


556
01:00:51.075 --> 01:00:52.574
No.

557
01:00:54.111 --> 01:00:56.178
Not completely.

558
01:00:56.180 --> 01:00:59.681
Did you give Detective Banerji
the newsreels?


559
01:00:59.683 --> 01:01:02.251
I did.

560
01:01:02.253 --> 01:01:05.754
But he has a dozen
open murder cases.


561
01:01:05.756 --> 01:01:07.756
He's not about to take up a case
from 30 years ago.


562
01:01:07.758 --> 01:01:09.091
But if it's coming from you--

563
01:01:09.093 --> 01:01:11.293
Especially
if it's coming from me.


564
01:01:11.295 --> 01:01:16.198
Were you and Detective Banerji
ever in a relationship?


565
01:01:16.200 --> 01:01:18.600
I saw a photo.

566
01:01:18.602 --> 01:01:21.603
I'm afraid we still are.

567
01:01:21.605 --> 01:01:22.905
He's my father.

568
01:01:24.708 --> 01:01:27.576
I don't usually tell people.

569
01:01:27.578 --> 01:01:30.145
I was a screw-up
when he got me the job.


570
01:01:30.147 --> 01:01:31.813
And where is your mum?

571
01:01:33.183 --> 01:01:35.083
My mum's not alive.

572
01:01:39.790 --> 01:01:44.159
Ronnie, are you still
looking for answers?


573
01:01:44.161 --> 01:01:46.862
What do you mean?

574
01:01:46.864 --> 01:01:49.331
I found the original
police file.


575
01:01:51.201 --> 01:01:54.069
The police did have
a suspect back then.


576
01:01:54.071 --> 01:01:56.738
Arun Das.

577
01:02:01.812 --> 01:02:04.246
<i>Arun Das.</i>

578
01:02:04.248 --> 01:02:06.715
<i>Arun Das.</i>

579
01:02:08.285 --> 01:02:10.152
Ronnie, maybe
we should leave this.


580
01:02:10.154 --> 01:02:11.153
No.

581
01:02:13.724 --> 01:02:15.257
He was a priest?

582
01:02:15.259 --> 01:02:16.258
In training.

583
01:02:16.260 --> 01:02:17.893
After they shot him,

584
01:02:17.895 --> 01:02:20.862
Arun Das was never seen again.

585
01:02:22.967 --> 01:02:24.299
So...

586
01:02:26.670 --> 01:02:28.670
How old was he
when they shot him?


587
01:02:28.672 --> 01:02:33.809
He was, uh... 28 then.

588
01:02:33.811 --> 01:02:36.244
The worst thing
is that all the victims


589
01:02:36.246 --> 01:02:38.080
were people he should have
cared about.


590
01:02:38.082 --> 01:02:40.015
I don't understand.

591
01:02:40.017 --> 01:02:41.750
Like relatives, loved ones.

592
01:02:41.752 --> 01:02:45.787
The last victim who ended up
brain damaged was...


593
01:02:45.789 --> 01:02:47.289
Arun's mother.

594
01:02:49.193 --> 01:02:51.727
- Does it say where he lived?
- In one of the slums.


595
01:02:51.729 --> 01:02:54.930
- Which slum?
- Um...


596
01:02:54.932 --> 01:02:55.998
Khalside.

597
01:02:57.735 --> 01:02:59.968
The rumor is he used
to spend nights there


598
01:02:59.970 --> 01:03:03.639
with a medium called, um...

599
01:03:03.641 --> 01:03:05.173
Rakhee.

600
01:03:11.115 --> 01:03:13.248
This is where
your mum was knocked over?


601
01:03:18.989 --> 01:03:21.857
Why do you think
she came here?


602
01:03:21.859 --> 01:03:23.258
I don't know.

603
01:03:24.328 --> 01:03:26.361
But it has to do
with Rakhee.


604
01:03:34.772 --> 01:03:38.006
- You know where you're going?
- Yeah, it's this way.


605
01:03:44.014 --> 01:03:46.248
- She sold me the water.
- What?


606
01:03:46.250 --> 01:03:48.817
At the airport.

607
01:03:48.819 --> 01:03:50.085
Ronnie!

608
01:03:51.321 --> 01:03:52.821
Wait!

609
01:03:52.823 --> 01:03:53.889
Wait!

610
01:03:58.762 --> 01:03:59.828
Wait!

611
01:04:03.734 --> 01:04:04.800
Stop!

612
01:04:39.169 --> 01:04:40.168
Hello?

613
01:04:42.473 --> 01:04:43.805
Hello?

614
01:04:55.953 --> 01:04:58.386
Ah, Ronnie, what happened?

615
01:04:58.388 --> 01:05:00.756
Some... Someone...

616
01:05:06.296 --> 01:05:08.363
This is the place.

617
01:06:29.112 --> 01:06:31.546
She's saying your mother
came in with this knife.


618
01:06:31.548 --> 01:06:33.348
Who was my mother looking for?

619
01:06:39.423 --> 01:06:40.422
Rakhee.

620
01:06:57.608 --> 01:06:58.607
Nah.

621
01:07:24.434 --> 01:07:27.002
Where is Rakhee now?
Is she alive?


622
01:07:30.607 --> 01:07:33.541
<i>Arun Das.</i>

623
01:07:37.047 --> 01:07:39.681
<i>Arun Das.</i>

624
01:08:03.941 --> 01:08:07.409
This is where the cop said
he shot him. Bullet hole.


625
01:08:07.411 --> 01:08:09.110
Look.

626
01:08:10.380 --> 01:08:12.948
This really could be Arun Das.

627
01:08:13.951 --> 01:08:15.717
<i>Arun Das.</i>

628
01:08:17.120 --> 01:08:18.520
<i>Arun Das.</i>

629
01:08:18.522 --> 01:08:21.156
Hey.

630
01:09:43.140 --> 01:09:44.472
Hello?

631
01:09:48.145 --> 01:09:50.111
Ronnie.

632
01:09:50.113 --> 01:09:52.380
My father caught
the Elgin House killer.


633
01:09:52.382 --> 01:09:55.150
They're at the station.

634
01:10:03.160 --> 01:10:05.794
How did you know
this was there?


635
01:10:05.796 --> 01:10:08.296
I don't know.

636
01:10:08.298 --> 01:10:09.798
What does it say?

637
01:10:09.800 --> 01:10:13.435
"Send seven souls to hell
in seven nights


638
01:10:13.437 --> 01:10:15.203
in place of my soul,

639
01:10:15.205 --> 01:10:18.339
so I can return forever,
Rakshasa."


640
01:10:18.341 --> 01:10:20.542
A Rakshasa is a demon king.

641
01:10:20.544 --> 01:10:22.710
Yes. This demon.

642
01:10:22.712 --> 01:10:25.346
Kali Yuga's coming.

643
01:10:28.085 --> 01:10:32.253
My mother knew
all about this stuff.


644
01:10:32.255 --> 01:10:34.255
It took ahold of her.

645
01:10:34.257 --> 01:10:35.757
What does it mean?

646
01:10:35.759 --> 01:10:39.094
There's a prophecy in the Vedas.

647
01:10:41.565 --> 01:10:43.131
Kali Yuga.

648
01:10:43.132 --> 01:10:44.698
A time when demons
walk the Earth again.


649
01:10:44.701 --> 01:10:47.535
Families kill each other.

650
01:10:47.537 --> 01:10:49.704
Apocalypse.

651
01:10:49.706 --> 01:10:54.776
If that's the ritual,
he failed.


652
01:10:54.778 --> 01:10:57.545
Arun didn't kill seven.

653
01:10:57.547 --> 01:11:00.482
Twenty-eight years ago.

654
01:11:00.484 --> 01:11:02.584
So who's your father arrested?

655
01:11:06.256 --> 01:11:08.123
Please.

656
01:11:17.667 --> 01:11:20.401
Family of the dead girl.

657
01:11:20.403 --> 01:11:21.569
Come in.

658
01:11:29.880 --> 01:11:31.546
Sit down.

659
01:11:44.594 --> 01:11:47.395
But he's just a boy.

660
01:11:54.304 --> 01:11:55.870
You're not allowed in here!

661
01:11:57.440 --> 01:11:59.440
I signed him in.

662
01:12:00.677 --> 01:12:03.378
Did this kid
really kill my mother?


663
01:12:03.380 --> 01:12:04.879
No.

664
01:12:04.881 --> 01:12:07.682
He just killed the girl,
Shugan Nagush.


665
01:12:07.684 --> 01:12:09.684
He has an alibi
for your mother's death.


666
01:12:09.686 --> 01:12:11.452
It checks out.

667
01:12:11.454 --> 01:12:14.889
But he painted the same symbol
over the girl's bed.


668
01:12:16.560 --> 01:12:19.427
Even if he painted it,
it's irrelevant.


669
01:12:19.429 --> 01:12:21.696
He was in a study group
when your mother died.


670
01:12:21.698 --> 01:12:23.264
Twenty people saw him.

671
01:12:23.266 --> 01:12:24.365
Then who drew it?

672
01:12:27.771 --> 01:12:33.208
After your mother's death,
you ran down to her body, right?


673
01:12:33.210 --> 01:12:34.509
This is bullshit.

674
01:12:34.511 --> 01:12:36.544
Papa, please.

675
01:12:37.914 --> 01:12:39.914
You need to look at this file.

676
01:12:43.286 --> 01:12:46.955
There was a series of murders
just like this in 1987.


677
01:12:46.957 --> 01:12:49.624
The same symbol was used.

678
01:12:49.626 --> 01:12:53.661
You are investigating my case
with the suspect?


679
01:12:53.663 --> 01:12:56.631
Read this file.

680
01:12:56.633 --> 01:12:58.967
All of this is connected
to the present-day murders.


681
01:12:58.969 --> 01:13:01.736
Have you gone completely crazy?

682
01:13:01.738 --> 01:13:05.607
You need to listen to us
or five more people may die.


683
01:13:05.609 --> 01:13:06.808
Enough!

684
01:13:14.751 --> 01:13:18.786
Shugan Nagush's family
needs a car home.


685
01:13:18.788 --> 01:13:20.255
Go. Call for one.

686
01:13:41.411 --> 01:13:42.877
Your mother's valuables.

687
01:13:42.879 --> 01:13:45.880
You can collect the clothes
from the front desk.


688
01:13:50.687 --> 01:13:52.320
What does this mean?

689
01:13:52.322 --> 01:13:54.422
Aren't you investigating it
anymore?


690
01:13:54.424 --> 01:13:57.425
We recovered the CCTV footage
from the hospital.


691
01:13:57.427 --> 01:14:00.361
Nobody went in
or out of the ward.


692
01:14:02.399 --> 01:14:03.831
I wanna watch that footage.

693
01:14:12.942 --> 01:14:14.976
Listen.

694
01:14:14.978 --> 01:14:19.714
The only person who could have
killed your mother is you.


695
01:14:19.716 --> 01:14:23.318
Now, I don't think
I can prove that,


696
01:14:23.320 --> 01:14:26.688
but if you like,
I can give it a damn good try.


697
01:15:26.516 --> 01:15:29.617
Asha, it's me, Ronnie.
I need to talk to you.


698
01:15:29.619 --> 01:15:32.153
I need your help
with something.


699
01:15:32.155 --> 01:15:35.423
I wanna talk to the family
of the girl that was murdered.


700
01:15:37.127 --> 01:15:39.594
The case has been closed,
Ronnie.


701
01:15:39.596 --> 01:15:41.396
He's not the real killer.

702
01:15:41.398 --> 01:15:42.897
My father suspended me
from duty.


703
01:15:42.899 --> 01:15:44.665
It's over.

704
01:15:44.667 --> 01:15:46.601
But that's not
what you believe, is it?


705
01:15:46.603 --> 01:15:49.537
I don't know
what I believe in anymore.


706
01:15:49.539 --> 01:15:51.672
That kid didn't do this.

707
01:15:51.674 --> 01:15:53.574
Your dad knows it.

708
01:15:53.576 --> 01:15:55.576
He just needed
to make an arrest.


709
01:15:55.578 --> 01:16:00.481
Why are you still doing this?
Maybe my father was right.


710
01:16:00.483 --> 01:16:02.483
You should just go back home
for your own good.


711
01:16:02.485 --> 01:16:03.518
I can't.

712
01:16:03.520 --> 01:16:05.853
If I just leave this,

713
01:16:05.855 --> 01:16:08.423
how do I know it won't
follow me back to England?


714
01:16:08.425 --> 01:16:12.593
The victims were all close
to the killer 28 years ago


715
01:16:12.595 --> 01:16:15.897
Maybe my Mum is somehow
connected to this girl's family?


716
01:16:25.108 --> 01:16:27.842
Write it down.
You have a pen?


717
01:16:27.844 --> 01:16:29.143
Yeah.

718
01:16:31.881 --> 01:16:33.548
It's Golback Road.

719
01:16:33.550 --> 01:16:36.083
45A Karun Apartments.

720
01:16:36.085 --> 01:16:38.219
The girl's father's name
is Roger Degosh.


721
01:16:39.789 --> 01:16:41.222
Roger?

722
01:16:41.224 --> 01:16:42.824
What is it?

723
01:17:24.968 --> 01:17:27.201
I'm very sorry to disturb you.

724
01:17:27.203 --> 01:17:29.704
May I talk to you
about your daughter Sekonia?


725
01:17:29.706 --> 01:17:32.840
Why? Who are you?

726
01:17:36.513 --> 01:17:38.880
My mother was killed.

727
01:17:38.882 --> 01:17:40.848
I think the same person
may be responsible.


728
01:17:44.721 --> 01:17:46.754
I'm sorry.

729
01:17:46.756 --> 01:17:48.623
Okay, come in.

730
01:17:48.625 --> 01:17:50.057
Hashminda!

731
01:17:50.059 --> 01:17:51.726
Come in 10 minutes.

732
01:18:03.239 --> 01:18:04.305
Come.

733
01:18:08.278 --> 01:18:11.646
Can I offer you
a cup of tea, uh...


734
01:18:11.648 --> 01:18:14.282
Mr. Degosh, may I show you
a picture of my mother?


735
01:18:38.308 --> 01:18:39.640
Ronnie?

736
01:18:46.182 --> 01:18:48.649
She told me you were dead.

737
01:19:16.079 --> 01:19:20.781
We keep on being told
that the power cuts will stop,


738
01:19:20.783 --> 01:19:24.919
but they really have been
getting worse.


739
01:19:27.757 --> 01:19:29.757
Why did Mum leave India?

740
01:19:35.231 --> 01:19:37.965
What did she tell you?

741
01:19:37.967 --> 01:19:41.969
The story I know now
is completely untrue.


742
01:19:41.971 --> 01:19:46.240
I didn't even know I was
born here until five days ago,


743
01:19:46.242 --> 01:19:48.843
when Uncle Mohan told me.

744
01:19:51.047 --> 01:19:53.948
What really happened?

745
01:19:53.950 --> 01:19:58.953
As soon as you were born,
you got very sick.


746
01:19:58.955 --> 01:20:02.356
The doctors were certain
that you wouldn't last the week.


747
01:20:02.358 --> 01:20:05.092
What was wrong with me?

748
01:20:05.094 --> 01:20:07.328
It was your heart.

749
01:20:07.330 --> 01:20:09.997
After four days,
the doctors told us


750
01:20:09.999 --> 01:20:14.802
that they were going to try
a last ditch operation,


751
01:20:14.804 --> 01:20:19.073
but... we must prepare
for the worst.


752
01:20:20.443 --> 01:20:22.977
But I got better.

753
01:20:22.979 --> 01:20:24.979
I survived.

754
01:20:24.981 --> 01:20:27.214
The scar on my chest
is from the operation.


755
01:20:36.426 --> 01:20:38.793
Your mother
used to go to séances.


756
01:20:38.795 --> 01:20:41.095
Did Mohan tell you that?

757
01:20:42.965 --> 01:20:46.233
Without telling me, she took you
from your hospital bed


758
01:20:46.235 --> 01:20:48.335
before they could operate.

759
01:20:48.337 --> 01:20:50.705
Where did she take me?

760
01:20:52.175 --> 01:20:57.144
I found her back at our flat
just before dawn,


761
01:20:57.146 --> 01:21:00.915
packing a suitcase,

762
01:21:00.917 --> 01:21:05.186
and you were lying
in a basket


763
01:21:05.188 --> 01:21:07.421
by her bed.

764
01:21:07.423 --> 01:21:12.426
You had a fresh scar
all the way down your chest.


765
01:21:12.428 --> 01:21:15.062
But you seemed...

766
01:21:15.064 --> 01:21:17.131
you seemed better.

767
01:21:17.133 --> 01:21:21.435
She took me to Rakhee,
didn't she?


768
01:21:28.177 --> 01:21:30.177
You know about her.

769
01:21:31.814 --> 01:21:34.982
Your mother told me
that Rakhee had cured you


770
01:21:34.984 --> 01:21:38.285
and that we had to leave India
right this moment.


771
01:21:38.287 --> 01:21:40.988
Go far away.

772
01:21:40.990 --> 01:21:42.890
I couldn't accept it.

773
01:21:42.892 --> 01:21:48.829
I told her I didn't believe
in witchcraft.


774
01:21:48.831 --> 01:21:50.931
I refused to leave.

775
01:21:50.933 --> 01:21:53.467
But when I woke up
the next morning,


776
01:21:53.469 --> 01:21:55.469
you were both gone.

777
01:21:57.540 --> 01:21:59.240
What did Rakhee do to me?

778
01:21:59.242 --> 01:22:01.208
I don't know.

779
01:22:01.210 --> 01:22:04.411
Tell me what my mum said.

780
01:22:07.784 --> 01:22:10.118
Tell me!

781
01:22:10.119 --> 01:22:12.453
All she said was that Rakhee
had brought you back to us


782
01:22:12.455 --> 01:22:14.221
from the other side.

783
01:22:43.820 --> 01:22:45.186
Hashminda?

784
01:22:56.933 --> 01:23:01.969
Arun's victims
were all close to him.


785
01:23:01.971 --> 01:23:05.306
This time they're all
close to me.


786
01:23:05.308 --> 01:23:08.275
My mum, my half-sister.

787
01:23:08.277 --> 01:23:11.378
AJ's kid had that dream
that he'd be killed.


788
01:23:14.217 --> 01:23:18.419
Seven souls in seven nights,
remember?


789
01:23:18.421 --> 01:23:21.021
That's what the scroll said.
It's gonna be okay.


790
01:23:21.023 --> 01:23:22.456
What?

791
01:23:22.458 --> 01:23:24.992
Your half-sister
was killed six days ago.


792
01:23:24.994 --> 01:23:27.428
This week ends in...

793
01:23:27.430 --> 01:23:29.530
four hours.

794
01:23:33.035 --> 01:23:34.034
Fuck.

795
01:23:35.972 --> 01:23:37.271
Ronnie.

796
01:23:39.575 --> 01:23:42.009
It's gonna be okay, okay?

797
01:23:43.980 --> 01:23:45.279
It's gonna be...

798
01:24:57.253 --> 01:24:59.219
Stop!

799
01:24:59.221 --> 01:25:00.321
Oh!

800
01:25:01.590 --> 01:25:04.558
What the fuck was that?

801
01:25:04.560 --> 01:25:05.960
I'm sorry.

802
01:25:07.129 --> 01:25:08.195
What happened?

803
01:25:08.197 --> 01:25:10.197
I don't know.

804
01:25:12.635 --> 01:25:16.270
<i>Ronnie...</i>

805
01:25:29.085 --> 01:25:32.619
Asha, it's me.

806
01:26:42.691 --> 01:26:44.091
Thank you.

807
01:27:31.107 --> 01:27:34.508
Excuse me, do you recognize
any of these buildings?


808
01:27:41.650 --> 01:27:44.585
I want you to find
this building.


809
01:27:44.587 --> 01:27:45.819
This one here.

810
01:28:09.812 --> 01:28:11.478
Please wait for me, okay?

811
01:28:11.480 --> 01:28:14.815
I will triple
what's on your meter, yeah?


812
01:30:29.852 --> 01:30:31.418
You killed them all.

813
01:30:33.989 --> 01:30:36.556
I don't speak Bengali.
I can only understand--


814
01:31:47.496 --> 01:31:49.496
Where did you hide it?

815
01:33:22.658 --> 01:33:24.791
What?

816
01:33:24.793 --> 01:33:26.593
What foreign girl?

817
01:33:39.942 --> 01:33:41.842
No.

818
01:33:41.844 --> 01:33:45.779
No! No!

819
01:33:51.753 --> 01:33:53.787
Oh, Jesus, you're here.

820
01:33:53.789 --> 01:33:55.622
AJ, it's me, Ronnie!

821
01:33:56.758 --> 01:33:58.592
Ronnie.

822
01:33:58.594 --> 01:33:59.893
Thank God, yeah.

823
01:33:59.895 --> 01:34:01.628
Where have you been?

824
01:34:01.630 --> 01:34:03.663
I got people looking for you
all over Kolkata.


825
01:34:03.665 --> 01:34:05.665
Come, come, come, come.

826
01:34:05.667 --> 01:34:07.167
I was really starting
to freak out


827
01:34:07.169 --> 01:34:09.236
when you didn't come home
before sundown.


828
01:34:09.238 --> 01:34:11.037
Hey, you want a drink
or what?


829
01:34:11.039 --> 01:34:13.540
- Where is she?
- Who?


830
01:34:13.542 --> 01:34:15.609
- Lena.
- Who's Lena?


831
01:34:15.611 --> 01:34:17.777
My girlfriend Lena from the UK.
She's here.


832
01:34:17.779 --> 01:34:20.580
No, man, there's no one here.

833
01:34:20.582 --> 01:34:22.616
Is she coming in tonight?

834
01:34:22.618 --> 01:34:25.652
No. Maybe.

835
01:34:27.289 --> 01:34:29.289
Let me get you a cup of tea.

836
01:34:29.291 --> 01:34:33.159
I just made some.
You look beat, bro.


837
01:34:33.161 --> 01:34:34.761
Sure.

838
01:34:39.635 --> 01:34:44.104
Give me Lena's flight details,
and I'll go get her myself.


839
01:34:44.106 --> 01:34:46.673
You remember how chaotic
the airport is.


840
01:34:58.053 --> 01:34:59.686
Lena!

841
01:35:02.324 --> 01:35:03.823
Lena.

842
01:35:05.694 --> 01:35:07.928
Ronnie?

843
01:35:07.930 --> 01:35:09.296
Thank God, man.

844
01:35:09.298 --> 01:35:12.299
Where have you been?

845
01:35:12.301 --> 01:35:13.633
What's the matter, bro?

846
01:35:22.978 --> 01:35:25.278
It's very easy to get lost
at the airport.


847
01:35:38.126 --> 01:35:40.060
What are you doing, man?

848
01:35:46.969 --> 01:35:48.735
- AJ, AJ...
- What?


849
01:35:50.172 --> 01:35:51.237
Where's Lena?

850
01:35:51.239 --> 01:35:53.640
AJ, AJ!

851
01:35:56.111 --> 01:35:58.244
Lena?

852
01:35:58.246 --> 01:36:00.046
Lena!

853
01:36:00.048 --> 01:36:02.315
Daddy's dead!

854
01:36:02.317 --> 01:36:04.084
He's lying in the kitchen!

855
01:36:04.086 --> 01:36:05.185
Lena!

856
01:36:05.187 --> 01:36:06.252
Is that a Bengali number?

857
01:36:06.254 --> 01:36:07.354
Yes, it's a three.

858
01:36:07.356 --> 01:36:09.222
- You're dreaming.
- Lena!


859
01:36:15.864 --> 01:36:16.963
Lena?

860
01:36:25.741 --> 01:36:28.041
Lena? Lena?

861
01:36:28.043 --> 01:36:30.276
Lena. Oh, my God.
Stay with me.


862
01:36:31.913 --> 01:36:34.648
Okay, Lena,
get your arm around me.


863
01:36:34.650 --> 01:36:38.685
You can do this. Come on.
One, two, three, go.


864
01:36:38.687 --> 01:36:40.887
Come on, stay with me.
Stay with me.


865
01:36:40.889 --> 01:36:43.056
Help! Help!
Please help me!


866
01:36:46.395 --> 01:36:48.194
Just hold onto my hand, okay?
Just hold onto my hand.


867
01:36:48.196 --> 01:36:49.329
Yeah, good.
You're doing great.


868
01:36:49.331 --> 01:36:51.164
Wait.

869
01:36:51.166 --> 01:36:52.799
What's he injecting into me?

870
01:36:52.801 --> 01:36:54.067
She is losing pressure.

871
01:36:54.069 --> 01:36:55.802
He's just doing his job, okay?

872
01:36:55.804 --> 01:36:57.070
You're gonna be fine, babe.

873
01:36:57.072 --> 01:36:59.239
I need to talk to you.

874
01:36:59.241 --> 01:37:02.042
Remember me...

875
01:37:02.044 --> 01:37:06.413
me talking to you in bed
after the gig?


876
01:37:06.415 --> 01:37:10.817
Yeah. You said that you
weren't sure about touring


877
01:37:10.819 --> 01:37:12.419
and that, um...

878
01:37:12.421 --> 01:37:14.454
and that you wanted us
to spend more time together.


879
01:37:14.456 --> 01:37:17.924
- Need to tell you something.
- What is it?


880
01:37:17.926 --> 01:37:20.026
I'm pregnant.

881
01:37:32.874 --> 01:37:34.841
Lena! Lena! Lena!

882
01:37:34.843 --> 01:37:36.409
Lena! Oh, my God.

883
01:37:39.047 --> 01:37:41.214
No, no, no, no, no.

884
01:38:00.802 --> 01:38:03.903
No. No!

885
01:38:04.906 --> 01:38:05.939
No!

886
01:38:34.936 --> 01:38:36.402
<i>Kali Yuga's coming.</i>

887
01:38:36.404 --> 01:38:40.340
<i>A time when demons
walk the Earth again.</i>


888
01:38:40.342 --> 01:38:42.509
<i>Families kill each other.</i>

889
01:38:42.511 --> 01:38:44.477
<i>Apocalypse.</i>

890
01:38:56.091 --> 01:38:57.257
No.

891
01:38:59.361 --> 01:39:01.361
I'm not gonna let you win.

892
01:40:56.011 --> 01:40:58.144
No! No!

893
01:40:58.146 --> 01:40:59.345
No! Stop it!

894
01:40:59.347 --> 01:41:00.546
No, please!
