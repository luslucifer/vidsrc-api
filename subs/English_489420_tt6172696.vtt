00:01:43.903 --> 00:01:45.537
How about you unlock this door.

3
00:01:47.507 --> 00:01:49.841
And we can have the most
wonderful time of the year.


4
00:01:52.412 --> 00:01:54.092
You're never getting
out of this jail cell.


5
00:01:55.081 --> 00:01:56.081
Hmm.

6
00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:59.885
You're playing hard to get.

7
00:02:02.855 --> 00:02:05.457
You like the anticipation

8
00:02:06.526 --> 00:02:08.960
before you get the presents.

9
00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:10.629
Right?

10
00:02:20.807 --> 00:02:22.708
How long do you think
it's gonna be


11
00:02:23.876 --> 00:02:26.078
before daddy comes to get me?

12
00:02:27.613 --> 00:02:29.648
- Never.
- Hmm.


13
00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:32.084
See, we hit him.
And he's hurt.


14
00:02:33.386 --> 00:02:36.455
And sooner or later,
he's gotta go get help,


15
00:02:36.457 --> 00:02:38.123
and when he does,
he's gonna slip up.


16
00:02:39.625 --> 00:02:41.059
And I'm gonna be there
to nail him.


17
00:02:43.696 --> 00:02:45.530
The only place
that you two are going...


18
00:02:46.566 --> 00:02:47.833
Is to the chair.

19
00:04:14.855 --> 00:04:17.189
<i>Confirm 187
in Woodridge mall parking lot.</i>


20
00:04:17.191 --> 00:04:19.691
<i>CSU currently processing scene.</i>

21
00:04:19.693 --> 00:04:21.059
<i>Sheriff Mitchell arriving now.</i>

22
00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:25.096
Here ya go, chief.

23
00:04:27.233 --> 00:04:28.700
What is it?

24
00:04:28.702 --> 00:04:30.101
It's an eggnog latte.

25
00:04:30.937 --> 00:04:31.937
It's festive.

26
00:04:35.007 --> 00:04:36.074
Okay, what've we got?

27
00:04:37.677 --> 00:04:38.677
Dead guy.

28
00:04:38.679 --> 00:04:41.880
Yeah, your years of police
training served you well then.


29
00:04:42.114 --> 00:04:44.649
Well, we're calling in
for prints and fibers but...


30
00:04:44.651 --> 00:04:45.984
Anything?

31
00:04:45.986 --> 00:04:47.619
Kinda hard to get prints
in the snow.


32
00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:49.721
- Car?
- Yep.


33
00:04:49.889 --> 00:04:52.157
<i>That's it, right over there
in the parking lot.</i>


34
00:04:52.558 --> 00:04:53.925
<i>- Got the keys on him?
- No.</i>


35
00:04:53.927 --> 00:04:55.227
So do we have a cause of death?

36
00:04:57.965 --> 00:04:59.631
Well, I'm not a doctor but...

37
00:05:00.867 --> 00:05:02.200
There's the body.

38
00:05:02.202 --> 00:05:03.835
And his head is that.

39
00:05:05.738 --> 00:05:06.838
Jesus...

40
00:05:11.645 --> 00:05:12.677
Is there anything else?

41
00:05:12.679 --> 00:05:14.746
Actually, yeah. Dave!

42
00:05:14.748 --> 00:05:16.014
Yes, deputy Fullard?

43
00:05:17.216 --> 00:05:18.216
Thanks.

44
00:05:20.987 --> 00:05:22.521
Want me to run it up?

45
00:05:22.523 --> 00:05:25.090
Yeah. See if we can pull
some DNA off this.


46
00:05:25.092 --> 00:05:26.625
Hey, can you run
that up, please?


47
00:05:26.627 --> 00:05:28.260
- Yes sir.
- Thanks.


48
00:05:29.562 --> 00:05:31.082
Listen, sheriff,
what are you thinking?


49
00:05:32.298 --> 00:05:33.298
Nothing good.

50
00:05:38.037 --> 00:05:39.704
You're not really him.

51
00:05:47.914 --> 00:05:50.282
There you are!

52
00:06:11.337 --> 00:06:12.637
<i>Tell me!</i>

53
00:06:12.639 --> 00:06:15.740
<i>You seem to have the answers
for everything.</i>


54
00:06:16.642 --> 00:06:18.910
<i>Why don't you do
what you always promised?</i>


55
00:06:18.912 --> 00:06:20.946
<i>Don't punish me for working!</i>

56
00:06:21.247 --> 00:06:22.581
<i>I got you everything!</i>

57
00:06:22.949 --> 00:06:24.316
<i>What do you want?</i>

58
00:06:31.591 --> 00:06:32.991
<i>What do you want me to do?</i>

59
00:06:44.605 --> 00:06:46.838
<i>I never see you.
You're never home for dinner.</i>


60
00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:50.075
<i>She waited for you
and I've had it!</i>


61
00:06:55.147 --> 00:06:56.281
If this is happening...

62
00:06:56.916 --> 00:06:58.049
If this is what you want...

63
00:06:58.718 --> 00:07:00.085
We should do what?

64
00:07:00.087 --> 00:07:01.653
We need to tell her!

65
00:07:02.722 --> 00:07:03.755
Hey, sweetheart.

66
00:07:04.357 --> 00:07:06.091
Felt sure you were
never getting up.


67
00:07:06.792 --> 00:07:09.327
Yeah, well, I decided
to grace you with my presence.


68
00:07:09.329 --> 00:07:10.962
It's Christmas, after all.

69
00:07:21.307 --> 00:07:22.407
I need to be moving.

70
00:07:24.410 --> 00:07:26.645
Okay.

71
00:07:26.647 --> 00:07:32.217
<i>woodridge mall, due
to a police investigation</i>


72
00:07:32.219 --> 00:07:33.918
<i>in the mall parking lot...</i>

73
00:07:34.286 --> 00:07:35.887
What?

74
00:07:35.889 --> 00:07:37.188
Doesn't matter.

75
00:07:37.690 --> 00:07:40.291
Come on, you got something
to say, just say it.


76
00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:42.027
This is bullshit.

77
00:07:42.029 --> 00:07:43.228
- Jen!
- What?


78
00:07:43.230 --> 00:07:45.397
I don't like that
kind of language.


79
00:07:45.399 --> 00:07:46.665
Mom, what is this?

80
00:07:47.133 --> 00:07:49.367
It's... complicated.

81
00:07:49.369 --> 00:07:51.269
It's divorce, mom.
I know what it is.


82
00:07:53.105 --> 00:07:54.205
- Frank and i...
- Frank?!


83
00:07:54.707 --> 00:07:56.808
You've stopped
calling him dad already?


84
00:07:57.443 --> 00:08:00.945
We feel that it would be easier
to just get through Christmas


85
00:08:00.947 --> 00:08:02.981
- and then we can...
- Just split?


86
00:08:04.216 --> 00:08:07.886
We all want a nice family
Christmas together.


87
00:08:07.888 --> 00:08:08.853
Right?

88
00:08:08.855 --> 00:08:13.725
<i>despite the ongoing
police investigation there.</i>


89
00:08:14.226 --> 00:08:16.828
We're only doing this
because we love you, sweetheart.


90
00:08:18.898 --> 00:08:19.898
It's a lie, mom.

91
00:08:20.366 --> 00:08:21.366
It's not even a good one.

92
00:08:24.236 --> 00:08:25.336
I'm gonna be late.

93
00:08:25.771 --> 00:08:26.771
Jennifer...

94
00:09:18.124 --> 00:09:20.024
No Santa.

95
00:09:20.026 --> 00:09:22.927
So I guess that means no work
for you too, huh?


96
00:09:23.295 --> 00:09:25.063
Guess so.

97
00:09:25.065 --> 00:09:27.332
That's what I should ask Santa
for: All play and no work.


98
00:09:27.334 --> 00:09:30.168
I have no idea what
I want for Christmas.


99
00:09:30.170 --> 00:09:32.437
Uh, a boyfriend
with a huge cock.


100
00:09:32.905 --> 00:09:34.506
Hasn't he stiffed you
enough on that one?


101
00:09:35.107 --> 00:09:36.941
A girl can dream, can't I?

102
00:09:36.943 --> 00:09:38.476
Dream about what, babe?

103
00:09:38.478 --> 00:09:40.378
About what I
really want for Christmas.


104
00:09:40.813 --> 00:09:43.782
- Is it perfume?
- Yeah, it's perfume, Joe.


105
00:09:43.784 --> 00:09:45.383
I thought you guys
weren't doing the mall.


106
00:09:45.385 --> 00:09:47.352
Well, Lancelot had
to see his maiden.


107
00:09:47.354 --> 00:09:49.254
You're so weird.

108
00:09:49.256 --> 00:09:51.489
- Good weird?
- There is no good weird.


109
00:09:52.124 --> 00:09:54.204
David's on his way up.
Hey, did you guys see the lot?


110
00:09:54.293 --> 00:09:56.227
- No.
- Police everywhere.


111
00:09:56.229 --> 00:09:57.495
- Why?
- Dead guy.


112
00:09:57.897 --> 00:09:59.063
Who?

113
00:10:01.100 --> 00:10:02.934
- No way.
- -Yeah.


114
00:10:02.936 --> 00:10:04.936
Probably got drunk
and broke his neck or something.


115
00:10:05.237 --> 00:10:06.538
Holy shit!

116
00:10:06.540 --> 00:10:07.939
Don't!

117
00:10:08.440 --> 00:10:10.842
- Jen starts as an elf tomorrow.
- Sweet.


118
00:10:10.976 --> 00:10:13.444
My mom thought it would
take my mind off things.


119
00:10:13.446 --> 00:10:14.879
Hey, I thought that was my job.

120
00:10:15.214 --> 00:10:17.916
Hey. What's happening?

121
00:10:18.050 --> 00:10:19.918
Jen's impending job as an elf.

122
00:10:20.085 --> 00:10:21.186
The kids love me.

123
00:10:21.587 --> 00:10:22.587
They shouldn't.

124
00:10:24.356 --> 00:10:25.590
The kids shouldn't love me?

125
00:10:25.592 --> 00:10:27.892
No, no.
Not... not you, babe.


126
00:10:27.894 --> 00:10:29.060
Christmas.

127
00:10:29.062 --> 00:10:30.595
Why can't kids love Christmas?

128
00:10:30.597 --> 00:10:32.964
- Yeah, man, what gives?
- They're being lied to.


129
00:10:33.199 --> 00:10:35.133
Seems like a pretty
harmless lie.


130
00:10:35.135 --> 00:10:38.937
Really? Sitting on some fat
guy's lap all day, huh?


131
00:10:38.939 --> 00:10:41.506
Sounds like a pedophile's
dream to me.


132
00:10:41.508 --> 00:10:44.142
Please don't make Christmas anymore
depressing than it already is.


133
00:10:44.144 --> 00:10:48.112
That's why we should totally
have our party on Christmas Eve!


134
00:10:48.480 --> 00:10:50.348
- Party?
- Yeah. It's, uh...


135
00:10:50.350 --> 00:10:52.617
- It's called drum fest.
- Drum fest?


136
00:10:53.285 --> 00:10:55.587
Yeah, it's a drumming competition
happening down at Phil's bar.


137
00:10:55.589 --> 00:10:56.621
This is really lame.

138
00:10:56.623 --> 00:10:59.090
I have training for
the swim meet that night.


139
00:10:59.092 --> 00:11:00.491
Besides, we're not gonna get in.

140
00:11:00.493 --> 00:11:02.093
You can miss one day
of training.


141
00:11:02.095 --> 00:11:03.995
Phil is calling it
a private affair.


142
00:11:03.997 --> 00:11:06.077
The bar's closed to anyone
who doesn't have a ticket.


143
00:11:06.298 --> 00:11:07.565
But I don't have a ticket.

144
00:11:07.567 --> 00:11:09.634
There aren't actually
any tickets.


145
00:11:09.636 --> 00:11:11.469
He just wants to call it
a ticket-only affair.


146
00:11:12.137 --> 00:11:14.038
Oh, that reminds me.

147
00:11:14.040 --> 00:11:17.609
I need a lead groupie, you know,
just to tell me how great I am.


148
00:11:17.611 --> 00:11:19.878
- Oh, how could a girl say no?
- Me, too.


149
00:11:19.880 --> 00:11:22.981
You don't even play the drums.

150
00:11:22.983 --> 00:11:25.583
Well, no, but I have a pretty
sick iTunes playlist


151
00:11:25.585 --> 00:11:27.252
and maybe I'll let you
hear it if...


152
00:11:27.254 --> 00:11:29.354
If what?
I lose my phone?


153
00:11:29.356 --> 00:11:33.524
We're having an annual boyfriend
review on January 1st, Joe,


154
00:11:33.526 --> 00:11:35.460
and you seriously
need to up your game.


155
00:11:37.897 --> 00:11:38.897
Babe?

156
00:11:42.568 --> 00:11:44.636
- She'll be back.
- Sure, man.


157
00:11:45.938 --> 00:11:46.938
Sure.

158
00:12:03.022 --> 00:12:04.489
You want me to close the mall?

159
00:12:05.457 --> 00:12:06.457
Morning, Bob.

160
00:12:10.996 --> 00:12:12.297
I'm considering it.

161
00:12:12.299 --> 00:12:14.065
- Considering?
- Yeah.


162
00:12:14.700 --> 00:12:16.067
Is the killer in the mall?

163
00:12:16.069 --> 00:12:17.168
No.

164
00:12:18.237 --> 00:12:19.337
Then why close it?

165
00:12:19.339 --> 00:12:22.073
Bob, this is a serious situation
and I'm trying to prevent...


166
00:12:22.075 --> 00:12:24.375
How long you been
in this town, sheriff?


167
00:12:25.344 --> 00:12:26.511
Thirty years.

168
00:12:26.513 --> 00:12:29.347
We like to keep things
simple here in Woodridge.


169
00:12:30.149 --> 00:12:32.350
Simply put,
a man's been murdered.


170
00:12:33.018 --> 00:12:35.086
Yeah, and I hope you catch
the son of a bitch.


171
00:12:35.088 --> 00:12:38.056
But we do not want
to start a panic now, do we?


172
00:12:39.058 --> 00:12:40.692
So you want me
to conduct this manhunt


173
00:12:40.694 --> 00:12:42.160
with one hand tied
behind my back?


174
00:12:42.962 --> 00:12:44.495
I want you to do your job,
sheriff.


175
00:12:45.431 --> 00:12:48.333
As always, Bob,
your leadership is inspiring.


176
00:12:52.371 --> 00:12:54.339
Have a productive day, sheriff.

177
00:12:54.673 --> 00:12:55.707
Asshole.

178
00:13:05.250 --> 00:13:09.087
<i>Wrpt Woodridge,
for all you couples looking</i>


179
00:13:09.089 --> 00:13:11.622
<i>to have some hot fun
together tonight...</i>


180
00:13:14.727 --> 00:13:16.594
- Jesus.
- Shit.


181
00:13:19.465 --> 00:13:21.432
What, uh, seems to be
the problem, officer?


182
00:13:22.468 --> 00:13:26.070
Yeah, I'm looking
for "old romantic 1980."


183
00:13:26.072 --> 00:13:27.072
Is that you?

184
00:13:27.706 --> 00:13:28.740
What?

185
00:13:28.742 --> 00:13:30.241
Yeah, man, we met online.

186
00:13:30.609 --> 00:13:31.609
Chat room.

187
00:13:32.544 --> 00:13:33.611
Are you serious?

188
00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:36.381
No, dipshit.
I'm joking.


189
00:13:37.583 --> 00:13:39.250
You two shouldn't be out here.

190
00:13:40.352 --> 00:13:41.719
It ain't illegal.

191
00:13:42.488 --> 00:13:44.255
What's that?
Call her parents?


192
00:13:44.257 --> 00:13:46.791
Uh, what he means, sir, is we're
not doing anybody any harm.


193
00:13:47.593 --> 00:13:49.153
And where do your parents
think you are?


194
00:13:49.461 --> 00:13:50.695
It's Christmas.

195
00:13:50.697 --> 00:13:52.497
You're a few days
out there, kid.


196
00:13:53.198 --> 00:13:54.432
All right, look.

197
00:13:54.434 --> 00:13:58.436
I'm heading out to Mcdermott's
place, checking on a call.


198
00:13:59.204 --> 00:14:00.371
I'll be about an hour.

199
00:14:00.373 --> 00:14:01.539
Okay.

200
00:14:02.274 --> 00:14:04.809
"So you'll be gone
when I get back," okay.


201
00:14:05.744 --> 00:14:06.744
Okay.

202
00:14:07.446 --> 00:14:08.780
Have a good evening, sir.

203
00:14:08.782 --> 00:14:10.081
Yeah.

204
00:14:10.083 --> 00:14:14.519
Shit. That was close.

205
00:14:14.521 --> 00:14:17.055
- Yeah.
- Think he's gone already?


206
00:14:17.057 --> 00:14:19.157
- Give him a chance, Troy.
- Okay.


207
00:14:20.726 --> 00:14:22.360
Maybe we should go.

208
00:14:22.362 --> 00:14:24.122
You heard him.
He's gonna be back in an hour.


209
00:14:27.299 --> 00:14:29.534
Come on, look, I'll let you
drive my car a bit.


210
00:14:30.235 --> 00:14:32.136
It's your dad's car, Troy.

211
00:14:32.138 --> 00:14:34.405
Well, I'll let you
play with my gears.


212
00:14:34.407 --> 00:14:36.207
It's an automatic.

213
00:14:39.711 --> 00:14:40.711
What was that?

214
00:14:41.814 --> 00:14:43.748
- What?
- There was a noise.


215
00:14:44.716 --> 00:14:47.819
- Babe, please.
- Don't, "babe, please" me.


216
00:14:47.821 --> 00:14:51.856
I'm taking you on your word that you're not
still fully hung up on your ex-girlfriend.


217
00:14:52.391 --> 00:14:53.858
- Jen?
- Yeah, Jen.


218
00:14:54.526 --> 00:14:56.527
Sweetheart, she means
nothing to me.


219
00:14:59.565 --> 00:15:02.500
There. Underneath the car.

220
00:15:02.502 --> 00:15:03.768
It's probably just a raccoon.

221
00:15:04.703 --> 00:15:05.870
Do you still wanna do this?

222
00:15:06.805 --> 00:15:08.439
I don't know.

223
00:15:08.441 --> 00:15:10.741
Babe, you're the only one for me.
There's nobody else.


224
00:15:11.810 --> 00:15:15.413
Mmm. Say more things
like that.


225
00:15:15.415 --> 00:15:17.849
The worst that could happen
is you get pregnant.


226
00:15:17.851 --> 00:15:19.784
I'm on birth control, you moron.

227
00:15:19.786 --> 00:15:21.819
Well, then what else
could go wrong?


228
00:15:21.821 --> 00:15:24.655
I have no idea why I love you.

229
00:15:24.657 --> 00:15:26.591
Baby, you...

230
00:15:32.898 --> 00:15:34.732
Shit!

231
00:15:34.734 --> 00:15:37.435
Get us out of here!

232
00:15:37.437 --> 00:15:39.670
It won't start.
There's no battery!


233
00:15:39.672 --> 00:15:41.772
Oh, my god!
Oh, my god!


234
00:15:44.210 --> 00:15:47.612
- Get out!
- My door is jammed!


235
00:15:50.183 --> 00:15:51.749
No!

236
00:16:56.782 --> 00:16:58.983
- Sheriff.
- Fullard.


237
00:17:01.653 --> 00:17:02.753
It's a mess.

238
00:17:03.655 --> 00:17:06.290
- Who?
- Two kids. Teenagers.


239
00:17:06.858 --> 00:17:08.226
What happened?

240
00:17:08.228 --> 00:17:11.395
Be a couple days before the
fire inspector gets back to us.


241
00:17:11.997 --> 00:17:14.665
Kathy says you saw them before.
Called something in.


242
00:17:15.267 --> 00:17:16.367
Didn't you recognize them?

243
00:17:17.536 --> 00:17:20.238
They're just kids.
I... I don't know...


244
00:17:20.240 --> 00:17:21.839
Come on, it's a small town.

245
00:17:23.842 --> 00:17:25.743
Look, sheriff, I haven't
been here as long as...


246
00:17:26.511 --> 00:17:27.511
Some people.

247
00:17:29.781 --> 00:17:30.982
Anything back on the DNA?

248
00:17:32.384 --> 00:17:34.452
Sent to the state
lab last night.


249
00:17:34.853 --> 00:17:36.813
You know we're not gonna be
first priority though.


250
00:17:37.289 --> 00:17:38.322
We might be.

251
00:17:40.926 --> 00:17:42.693
You don't think this is
connected to that?


252
00:17:43.595 --> 00:17:44.862
Completely different mos?

253
00:17:49.534 --> 00:17:51.134
I don't know what
I'm thinking right now.


254
00:17:52.471 --> 00:17:54.839
Only I was looking forward
to a quiet holiday season.


255
00:17:57.476 --> 00:17:59.277
Still haven't done my shopping.

256
00:17:59.279 --> 00:18:02.947
I don't two mur... three murders
dragging us into overtime.


257
00:18:10.589 --> 00:18:12.056
Look, it might be a coincidence.

258
00:18:12.058 --> 00:18:13.424
No such thing.

259
00:18:40.952 --> 00:18:42.887
Who could that be?

260
00:18:49.061 --> 00:18:50.428
Can I help you?

261
00:18:50.430 --> 00:18:51.829
Mrs. Frenchen?

262
00:18:52.431 --> 00:18:53.798
Yes?

263
00:18:53.800 --> 00:18:57.835
I'm in need of a good lawyer
and you came highly recommended.


264
00:18:58.570 --> 00:19:00.104
Could you open the door?

265
00:19:00.106 --> 00:19:02.606
I'm afraid I just
specialize in divorce.


266
00:19:02.608 --> 00:19:05.710
Well, then you're exactly
the person I'm looking for.


267
00:19:06.645 --> 00:19:10.648
You see, Santa, he told me he wouldn't
buy me a bear trap for Christmas.


268
00:19:11.450 --> 00:19:14.618
I reckon that's grounds
for divorce, right?


269
00:19:14.620 --> 00:19:16.420
You can come
by my office next week.


270
00:19:16.422 --> 00:19:18.182
I'd be happy to take a look
at what you need.


271
00:19:18.724 --> 00:19:22.560
I'm afraid there's a real bad time
limit on what I need you for.


272
00:19:28.033 --> 00:19:29.033
Who are you?

273
00:19:30.068 --> 00:19:32.970
Why, I'm Mrs.
Claus, of course.


274
00:19:59.866 --> 00:20:01.665
Tell me what you think
about my elf hair.


275
00:20:02.934 --> 00:20:05.069
So, Santa asked you
to sit on his lap?


276
00:20:05.537 --> 00:20:07.004
Please. If that asshole
hits on me again,


277
00:20:07.006 --> 00:20:08.639
I'm gonna pepper spray his ass.

278
00:20:08.641 --> 00:20:10.641
Is Lisa coming?

279
00:20:10.643 --> 00:20:11.776
Swim practice.

280
00:20:11.778 --> 00:20:13.677
That's dedication.

281
00:20:13.679 --> 00:20:15.513
She's gonna be selected
for the Olympic squad


282
00:20:15.515 --> 00:20:17.882
and we're still gonna be
stuck here in this mall.


283
00:20:17.884 --> 00:20:20.985
Speak for yourself. If they start
giving out gold medals for blow jobs...


284
00:20:20.987 --> 00:20:23.754
I'm going to Reicher's
bar later.


285
00:20:23.756 --> 00:20:25.756
- Do you wanna come?
- You're not gonna get served.


286
00:20:25.991 --> 00:20:28.092
Please! I have boobs.
Boys are dumb.


287
00:20:28.094 --> 00:20:29.927
- Hmm. No debate here.

288
00:20:29.929 --> 00:20:31.562
Hey, Jen, your break's finished.

289
00:20:31.564 --> 00:20:33.030
Hey, Jen...

290
00:20:33.032 --> 00:20:35.166
If you hate it so much,

291
00:20:35.168 --> 00:20:36.174
why'd you come back?

292
00:20:36.186 --> 00:20:39.103
It's either that or join in
on my family's awkward silences


293
00:20:39.105 --> 00:20:41.705
it's definitely happening then?

294
00:20:41.707 --> 00:20:43.941
The divorce?
God, I hope so.


295
00:20:44.810 --> 00:20:46.911
At least then we won't
have to play happy family.


296
00:20:48.647 --> 00:20:50.114
What's that?

297
00:20:50.116 --> 00:20:53.150
Oh, Joe and David wanted me
to hand these out.


298
00:20:53.585 --> 00:20:56.020
Well, aren't you
a good girlfriend?


299
00:20:56.022 --> 00:20:58.722
It's an annual tradition.

300
00:20:58.724 --> 00:21:01.759
- Being a good girlfriend?
- I'm an amazing girlfriend.


301
00:21:01.761 --> 00:21:03.661
He's so fucking lucky.

302
00:21:04.162 --> 00:21:06.030
And, no, the party is
an annual tradition.


303
00:21:06.032 --> 00:21:07.832
It's a stupid tradition.

304
00:21:07.834 --> 00:21:10.134
- Says the girl who's
dressed like an elf.


305
00:21:11.670 --> 00:21:14.071
Did you, um,
did you hear about Troy?


306
00:21:14.806 --> 00:21:15.873
No.

307
00:21:15.875 --> 00:21:18.242
He... died last night,

308
00:21:18.244 --> 00:21:21.045
in an accident
with Michelle Weaver.


309
00:21:21.179 --> 00:21:22.880
- Oh, my god.
- Yeah.


310
00:21:24.850 --> 00:21:27.218
Did you guys... um...

311
00:21:28.887 --> 00:21:30.688
Did you guys, like, do it?

312
00:21:31.089 --> 00:21:33.657
No, we... we only went out
for, like, three weeks.


313
00:21:33.659 --> 00:21:36.727
It's fine. In three weeks, I totally
would have fucked him, like, 30 times.


314
00:21:36.729 --> 00:21:38.262
Well, I didn't really
like him that much.


315
00:21:38.264 --> 00:21:39.763
Who said anything
about liking him?


316
00:21:39.765 --> 00:21:41.599
Well, what kind of accident?

317
00:21:41.601 --> 00:21:44.535
- I don't really know.
- I hope his family's okay.


318
00:21:52.111 --> 00:21:54.678
<i>Confirmation from the fire
department on two dead.</i>


319
00:21:54.680 --> 00:21:56.514
<i>Looks like it was deliberate.</i>

320
00:21:56.516 --> 00:21:58.616
<i>Traces of gas have been
found at the scene.</i>


321
00:22:05.190 --> 00:22:06.190
What?

322
00:22:06.725 --> 00:22:07.825
Uh...

323
00:22:08.894 --> 00:22:10.561
Come on.
Spit it out, Fullard.


324
00:22:11.196 --> 00:22:13.597
Manny was speaking
with the fire inspector.


325
00:22:13.599 --> 00:22:15.699
It's early, but he thinks
it was deliberate.


326
00:22:16.167 --> 00:22:18.035
Found traces
of gas on the ground


327
00:22:18.670 --> 00:22:20.170
and the starter cables were cut.

328
00:22:20.839 --> 00:22:22.206
Shit.

329
00:22:22.674 --> 00:22:24.975
It might not be related
to the Santa Claus at the mall.


330
00:22:25.110 --> 00:22:26.210
Oh, come on.

331
00:22:27.779 --> 00:22:29.099
What are you thinking?

332
00:22:31.149 --> 00:22:32.917
Like a serial killer?

333
00:22:33.084 --> 00:22:36.754
Hey, I don't want anyone speaking
those words out loud, you got it?


334
00:22:38.223 --> 00:22:40.124
- Then what?
- I don't know.


335
00:22:41.760 --> 00:22:43.861
Let's just take it easy
and compile evidence.


336
00:22:44.262 --> 00:22:45.829
Better yet, a suspect list.

337
00:22:46.064 --> 00:22:47.544
Wait, shouldn't they
have the same mo?


338
00:22:47.999 --> 00:22:50.000
They do.
They're all dead.


339
00:22:50.002 --> 00:22:51.635
Uh, mayor's office called.

340
00:22:51.637 --> 00:22:53.671
They're worried about
Christmas being ruined.


341
00:22:53.673 --> 00:22:56.307
Kathy, can you get NYPD homicide
on the line, please?


342
00:22:57.142 --> 00:22:59.677
He's been on line two
for five minutes.


343
00:22:59.679 --> 00:23:00.999
You know he called you
the Grinch?


344
00:23:01.146 --> 00:23:03.714
You gotta be fucking kidding me.

345
00:23:03.716 --> 00:23:06.617
I got three murders in two nights and he's
worried about people not spending enough?


346
00:23:06.985 --> 00:23:07.952
Kathy!

347
00:23:07.954 --> 00:23:09.853
Line two!

348
00:23:10.188 --> 00:23:11.221
He hung up!

349
00:23:11.957 --> 00:23:13.223
Okay, I'll get him back.

350
00:23:16.061 --> 00:23:17.761
Hey, don't shoot the messenger.

351
00:23:17.763 --> 00:23:20.598
I think the mayor's just worried
that one of the victims is a voter.


352
00:23:21.099 --> 00:23:22.299
Doesn't wanna lose too many.

353
00:23:22.801 --> 00:23:24.268
Kathy! Get me the bureau!

354
00:23:30.909 --> 00:23:32.009
Feds?

355
00:23:33.244 --> 00:23:34.979
Yeah, we're out of our depth
on this one.


356
00:23:39.184 --> 00:23:40.985
- What do you need?
- A drink.


357
00:23:45.123 --> 00:23:46.223
I'm okay.

358
00:23:59.104 --> 00:24:01.205
Told Joe to fuck right off,
you know what I mean?


359
00:24:01.207 --> 00:24:02.906
- Oh my god!
- All right.


360
00:24:02.908 --> 00:24:04.308
Cheers ladies!

361
00:24:07.779 --> 00:24:09.713
Okay.

362
00:24:09.715 --> 00:24:11.475
This one's totally going
on my Facebook wall.


363
00:24:12.250 --> 00:24:14.652
Don't tag me.

364
00:24:14.654 --> 00:24:16.286
My boyfriend thinks
I'm babysitting.


365
00:24:16.288 --> 00:24:19.123
Yeah. My mom thinks
I'm studying.


366
00:24:20.660 --> 00:24:22.092
Hey, beautiful lady!

367
00:24:22.427 --> 00:24:24.328
- Hey, lady!
- Oh god.


368
00:24:24.330 --> 00:24:26.964
- Hey, sexy lady! Whoo!
- Great.


369
00:24:26.966 --> 00:24:29.099
The last thing I want
right now is to be hit on.


370
00:24:29.101 --> 00:24:31.435
Funny, that's the first
thing that I want.


371
00:24:33.239 --> 00:24:35.773
Why don't we go to the sun house?
I have the key.


372
00:24:35.775 --> 00:24:37.341
We'd have the whole place
to ourselves.


373
00:24:38.209 --> 00:24:39.309
What's there?

374
00:24:39.911 --> 00:24:41.045
More alcohol.

375
00:24:41.047 --> 00:24:42.913
Hey, hot mama!

376
00:24:42.915 --> 00:24:43.915
Sure.

377
00:24:44.783 --> 00:24:46.717
Probably a small cock anyway.

378
00:24:48.153 --> 00:24:49.433
I'm just gonna use the bathroom.

379
00:24:52.457 --> 00:24:54.224
Let's not stay here alone.

380
00:24:57.829 --> 00:24:59.989
Maybe we should have sacrificed
Courtney to those guys.


381
00:25:01.232 --> 00:25:03.834
Wow. Remind me why
we're friends again?


382
00:25:14.846 --> 00:25:15.846
Hello?

383
00:25:19.451 --> 00:25:21.819
Are you okay?

384
00:25:22.487 --> 00:25:24.955
Honey, honey.

385
00:25:24.957 --> 00:25:26.323
Are you okay?

386
00:25:38.871 --> 00:25:41.038
Oh my god! Oh, my god!

387
00:25:41.040 --> 00:25:42.840
Please, no!

388
00:26:17.409 --> 00:26:18.409
No!

389
00:26:31.022 --> 00:26:33.323
But baby, I wanna play!

390
00:26:33.325 --> 00:26:34.825
Let's not be greedy,
Mrs. Claus.


391
00:26:38.429 --> 00:26:40.898
Four birds.
Four birds.


392
00:26:40.900 --> 00:26:42.533
'Tis more than enough
for one day.


393
00:26:54.112 --> 00:26:55.312
So, Santa Claus?

394
00:26:58.116 --> 00:26:59.349
And Mrs. Claus?

395
00:27:05.590 --> 00:27:08.058
Do you know why
they didn't hurt you?


396
00:27:13.531 --> 00:27:14.531
One sec, okay?

397
00:27:20.939 --> 00:27:21.939
Talk to me.

398
00:27:23.141 --> 00:27:24.441
Four dead girls.

399
00:27:25.009 --> 00:27:27.444
- Girls?
- Yeah, teenagers.


400
00:27:27.446 --> 00:27:29.980
- Underage.
- Shit.


401
00:27:32.183 --> 00:27:33.417
She say anything?

402
00:27:34.853 --> 00:27:37.454
Yeah, something about two freaks

403
00:27:37.456 --> 00:27:39.590
dressed up as
Mr. and Mrs. Claus.


404
00:27:39.592 --> 00:27:41.258
At least the mayor's
gonna love that.


405
00:27:42.026 --> 00:27:44.186
Never mind the press. We need
to start running with it.


406
00:27:45.430 --> 00:27:47.290
Get as much as you can on them.

407
00:27:47.599 --> 00:27:49.499
Mayor's on the line.
He wants to talk to you.


408
00:27:51.069 --> 00:27:52.402
That was fast. Jesus.

409
00:27:52.971 --> 00:27:54.271
Get on the horn, right now.

410
00:27:54.273 --> 00:27:56.006
Get the mall to pull
their Santa Claus off.


411
00:27:56.008 --> 00:27:57.107
What?

412
00:27:57.109 --> 00:28:00.043
Before some yahoo
blows his fucking brains out.


413
00:28:00.045 --> 00:28:02.145
No, we've got
media blackout on this.


414
00:28:02.380 --> 00:28:03.480
Oh, really?

415
00:28:03.882 --> 00:28:05.616
Twitter and Facebook disagree.

416
00:28:14.125 --> 00:28:15.225
Pigs.

417
00:28:22.934 --> 00:28:24.534
Why don't we call
your parents now, okay?


418
00:28:30.241 --> 00:28:31.341
Or I can.

419
00:28:55.366 --> 00:28:57.067
Santa Claus?

420
00:28:57.635 --> 00:28:59.536
He's dressed as
fucking Santa Claus?


421
00:29:00.138 --> 00:29:01.204
Yes.

422
00:29:01.940 --> 00:29:02.973
God damn it.

423
00:29:03.241 --> 00:29:04.508
I'm gonna put a curfew in place.

424
00:29:04.510 --> 00:29:05.943
- Excuse me?
- A curfew.


425
00:29:07.679 --> 00:29:09.719
There's no evidence these two
are related, is there?


426
00:29:10.315 --> 00:29:11.548
With all due respect, Mr. mayor,

427
00:29:11.550 --> 00:29:13.383
you're not a law
enforcement officer.


428
00:29:13.385 --> 00:29:16.520
No, I'm the mayor, and somebody
has to run this town.


429
00:29:18.389 --> 00:29:20.691
Do you have any idea what will
happen to Christmas sales


430
00:29:20.693 --> 00:29:22.392
if you close that mall?

431
00:29:22.394 --> 00:29:25.062
If people keep dying, there
won't be any customers left.


432
00:29:25.064 --> 00:29:29.232
You get your ass out there and
you find this guy and this girl


433
00:29:29.234 --> 00:29:32.069
and you lock 'em up
and you throw away the key.


434
00:29:32.071 --> 00:29:34.972
In the meantime,
you let me run this town.


435
00:29:35.173 --> 00:29:37.374
- Bob! We have to come to...
- That's enough!


436
00:29:38.109 --> 00:29:42.012
I was selected on a platform of decency
and promoting family values in Woodridge.


437
00:29:42.747 --> 00:29:45.148
These murders are
fucking that image up.


438
00:29:45.350 --> 00:29:47.584
Aren't you going to
a strip club this week?


439
00:29:47.586 --> 00:29:50.454
Yeah, because I put money
in the local economy.


440
00:29:50.688 --> 00:29:54.358
I support local business and I
get to see the voters up close.


441
00:29:54.692 --> 00:29:56.727
Very close up, I'm sure.

442
00:29:57.528 --> 00:29:58.628
Yeah.

443
00:29:59.197 --> 00:30:01.398
I am particularly looking
forward to...


444
00:30:02.166 --> 00:30:03.500
Seeing my niece.

445
00:30:04.435 --> 00:30:05.669
Who's all grown up now.

446
00:30:06.204 --> 00:30:08.505
Just starting at vixens.

447
00:30:09.273 --> 00:30:12.609
Excuse me.
I have an investigation to run.


448
00:30:12.611 --> 00:30:14.344
And I've got a town to run.

449
00:30:15.046 --> 00:30:17.147
And you will not pull Santa
out of that mall.


450
00:30:17.615 --> 00:30:19.282
You will double his security.

451
00:30:19.284 --> 00:30:20.284
Is that clear?

452
00:30:21.619 --> 00:30:22.619
Good.

453
00:30:29.360 --> 00:30:31.795
<i>Dispatch, this is unit 215.</i>

454
00:30:31.797 --> 00:30:34.498
<i>The feds have arrived.
It looks like the cavalry</i>


455
00:30:34.500 --> 00:30:36.066
<i>made it just before
the snow drifts</i>


456
00:30:36.068 --> 00:30:38.235
<i>completely cut the roads off.</i>

457
00:30:38.237 --> 00:30:40.270
<i>Copy that, 215.</i>

458
00:30:40.272 --> 00:30:42.272
<i>I guess we'll have to make some
room in the office.</i>


459
00:30:42.807 --> 00:30:44.374
<i>10-4.</i>

460
00:30:44.376 --> 00:30:46.143
<i>- So how many?
- Seven.</i>


461
00:30:46.778 --> 00:30:50.247
The four girls, a young
couple, and Santa.


462
00:30:50.249 --> 00:30:51.415
Missing a number.

463
00:30:51.417 --> 00:30:52.549
Excuse me?

464
00:30:54.118 --> 00:30:56.386
One, two and four.

465
00:30:57.388 --> 00:30:59.489
Shit, are you saying there could
be three more bodies out there?


466
00:30:59.491 --> 00:31:01.358
It's highly possible.

467
00:31:01.360 --> 00:31:03.427
Perhaps a remote
or isolated location.


468
00:31:03.628 --> 00:31:05.388
Might just be that we
haven't found them yet.


469
00:31:06.297 --> 00:31:08.137
These descriptions
of the killers are accurate?


470
00:31:08.766 --> 00:31:09.800
Oh, they're accurate.

471
00:31:12.503 --> 00:31:14.504
Those are from
the CCTV last night.


472
00:31:15.173 --> 00:31:16.640
Not saying they're
easy to swallow.


473
00:31:19.510 --> 00:31:23.346
Okay, the lady.
We figure mid-twenties.


474
00:31:24.315 --> 00:31:26.616
She's Mrs. Claus, for lack
of a better explanation.


475
00:31:27.185 --> 00:31:28.652
The guy? Well, Santa.

476
00:31:29.353 --> 00:31:30.620
Is he as big as Santa?

477
00:31:30.622 --> 00:31:33.490
About 30 to 40
years of age, we figure.


478
00:31:33.492 --> 00:31:35.792
Ex-military?
Former cop?


479
00:31:35.794 --> 00:31:37.627
Somebody who has the ability
to move quickly.


480
00:31:37.629 --> 00:31:38.869
And take multiple victims down.

481
00:31:39.497 --> 00:31:41.164
Yeah. This Mrs. Claus
is just for show.


482
00:31:41.166 --> 00:31:44.167
She's like, um,
letting off a stun grenade.


483
00:31:45.103 --> 00:31:46.570
This guy's the real deal.

484
00:31:46.804 --> 00:31:48.505
Okay.

485
00:31:48.507 --> 00:31:51.475
Well, we can't release any information
on the killer to the press.


486
00:31:51.477 --> 00:31:53.410
What?

487
00:31:53.412 --> 00:31:55.812
If he doesn't know we're onto
him, he'll keep using the suit.


488
00:31:56.314 --> 00:31:57.881
May be a good way to spot him.

489
00:31:57.883 --> 00:32:00.117
Oh, so just look for a guy
in a Santa suit at Christmas?


490
00:32:00.518 --> 00:32:02.786
To be honest, I don't think
this guy cares.


491
00:32:02.788 --> 00:32:04.287
Why do you say that?

492
00:32:04.289 --> 00:32:06.289
'Cause he let a girl
live to tell a tale.


493
00:32:06.624 --> 00:32:08.558
He wants people to know.

494
00:32:08.560 --> 00:32:10.660
You don't have to pander
to that.


495
00:32:10.662 --> 00:32:13.163
Yeah, but that may make him keep killing
until he gets the recognition he wants.


496
00:32:13.764 --> 00:32:16.533
Let's have a tight control on
information out to the public here.


497
00:32:16.535 --> 00:32:18.268
This is a small town.

498
00:32:18.270 --> 00:32:22.339
Either way, you need to find who
the victims were on the third day


499
00:32:22.341 --> 00:32:24.641
because there seems to be
a piece of this puzzle missing.


500
00:32:24.842 --> 00:32:27.444
- And we'll need your men on it.
- Oh, great.


501
00:32:27.446 --> 00:32:28.879
Go door to door if you have to.

502
00:32:28.881 --> 00:32:31.515
- It's a big town.
- You said it was a small town.


503
00:32:31.517 --> 00:32:33.850
I suggest you get every
available man on it.


504
00:32:33.852 --> 00:32:36.092
Find out if anyone has gone
missing in the last few days.


505
00:32:40.358 --> 00:32:42.826
I don't suppose you guys
want to lend a hand, do ya?


506
00:32:42.828 --> 00:32:45.362
"Many hands make light work,"
isn't that what they say?


507
00:32:45.763 --> 00:32:49.332
Between the training experience
myself and the other agents have,


508
00:32:49.334 --> 00:32:51.535
us doing grunt work would
be a poor use of our time.


509
00:32:51.769 --> 00:32:53.670
I'm sure your deputies
are more than capable.


510
00:32:54.438 --> 00:32:56.406
We'll stay here
and review the evidence.


511
00:32:56.408 --> 00:32:57.507
Okay, okay.

512
00:32:58.576 --> 00:32:59.910
What else do you need?

513
00:33:00.311 --> 00:33:02.179
How about a connection
between the victims.


514
00:33:02.181 --> 00:33:03.947
We need to understand
how he's choosing them.


515
00:33:04.815 --> 00:33:06.950
He's targeting them at night.
We know that much, at least.


516
00:33:06.952 --> 00:33:08.552
Nah, there's something else.

517
00:33:08.554 --> 00:33:10.387
They didn't know each other.
None of them did.


518
00:33:10.389 --> 00:33:12.789
And I can't establish any other
connection between them.


519
00:33:12.791 --> 00:33:14.925
Hey, hey. We're not here
to step on anyone's toes.


520
00:33:14.927 --> 00:33:18.662
Neither am I! I'm just trying
to catch this fucking guy!


521
00:33:19.564 --> 00:33:22.566
Guys, the clock's ticking.
This guy's killing every day.


522
00:33:25.603 --> 00:33:26.883
I'll double the patrols
at night.


523
00:33:29.440 --> 00:33:30.600
The curfew'll go into effect.

524
00:33:31.876 --> 00:33:34.344
Remember sheriff, you called us.

525
00:35:44.575 --> 00:35:45.575
Klein.

526
00:35:46.844 --> 00:35:48.645
Yeah, I'm at the Frenchen
residence.


527
00:35:52.650 --> 00:35:53.850
We've got three dead bodies.

528
00:35:55.419 --> 00:35:56.519
Yup.

529
00:35:57.788 --> 00:35:59.889
The mom, Mrs. Frenchen,
the daughter...


530
00:36:00.658 --> 00:36:01.858
And I found their dog as well.

531
00:36:03.861 --> 00:36:04.994
I haven't touched anything.

532
00:36:06.831 --> 00:36:08.064
Okay. I'll be here.

533
00:36:25.149 --> 00:36:27.851
This is probably just another small
town nut looking for attention.


534
00:36:28.719 --> 00:36:30.987
The sooner these cases stop
getting media coverage,


535
00:36:31.655 --> 00:36:33.456
the sooner the crazies
will realize there's no point


536
00:36:33.458 --> 00:36:35.018
in trying to get this type
of attention.


537
00:36:35.826 --> 00:36:37.460
My money's on a lone gunman.

538
00:36:37.628 --> 00:36:38.962
I'm going with postal worker.

539
00:36:39.397 --> 00:36:41.077
Postal worker would have
shot the place up.


540
00:36:41.432 --> 00:36:42.799
Fuck, then maybe it actually
is Santa Claus.


541
00:36:42.801 --> 00:36:44.067
Is anyone betting on that?

542
00:36:45.870 --> 00:36:47.871
If it was Santa Claus, where did
he park his sleigh and reindeer?


543
00:36:47.873 --> 00:36:49.739
Maybe he's gone green
and drives a Prius?


544
00:36:50.074 --> 00:36:50.075
My wife drives one of those.

545
00:36:50.075 --> 00:36:53.910
Oh, yeah? Can she account
for her whereabouts recently?


546
00:36:53.912 --> 00:36:55.445
Yeah. I know where
yours has been.


547
00:36:55.846 --> 00:36:57.180
I'm getting coffee. Anyone?

548
00:36:57.182 --> 00:36:58.182
No, thanks.

549
00:37:08.492 --> 00:37:11.027
<i>Where the fire ripped through
the county snow plow yard</i>


550
00:37:11.029 --> 00:37:13.463
<i>destroying nearly all of the
county's plows...</i>


551
00:37:15.567 --> 00:37:16.633
Hello?

552
00:37:18.903 --> 00:37:20.470
Okay. Just stay there.

553
00:37:20.905 --> 00:37:23.039
Don't touch anything.
I'm gonna get the guys.


554
00:37:23.741 --> 00:37:24.741
Who are they?

555
00:37:29.079 --> 00:37:30.747
Show me.
Three of them?


556
00:37:33.918 --> 00:37:36.052
Right. We're on our way.

557
00:37:36.054 --> 00:37:37.086
We're gonna...

558
00:38:05.217 --> 00:38:07.116
Help me!

559
00:38:34.178 --> 00:38:36.279
Woodridge is a town
gripped with fear.


560
00:38:36.281 --> 00:38:39.048
With the latest massacre
of five FBI agents,


561
00:38:39.050 --> 00:38:41.050
there is now a feeling
amongst the residents


562
00:38:41.052 --> 00:38:43.920
<i>that the Sheriff Department is
overwhelmed by the situation,</i>


563
00:38:44.522 --> 00:38:47.123
<i>prompting many people to leave
this town during the holiday.</i>


564
00:38:47.758 --> 00:38:50.960
<i>After all, if the FBI
aren't safe, then who is?</i>


565
00:39:14.885 --> 00:39:16.119
Yes, I understand.

566
00:39:17.187 --> 00:39:18.555
Certainly, certainly.

567
00:39:20.791 --> 00:39:21.791
All right.

568
00:39:23.994 --> 00:39:26.129
Whoever they were,
they move quick.


569
00:39:27.264 --> 00:39:30.867
Agent Klein managed to get off one
shot, so he may have been hit.


570
00:39:30.869 --> 00:39:32.769
Well, we're checking the blood
now but, to be fair,


571
00:39:32.771 --> 00:39:35.605
there's a lot of it,
so it's gonna take a while.


572
00:39:36.040 --> 00:39:37.040
He's hit?

573
00:39:37.641 --> 00:39:39.075
Possibly.

574
00:39:39.577 --> 00:39:41.778
We've taken blood samples
from the deceased agents


575
00:39:41.780 --> 00:39:44.948
and we're cross-matching that against
all the blood we found on the scene.


576
00:39:44.950 --> 00:39:46.880
If there's anything
extra, we know it's from


577
00:39:46.892 --> 00:39:48.618
the perp and it's
likely he's been hit.


578
00:39:48.819 --> 00:39:51.939
Okay, Fullard, let's get the bloodhounds
down here on the chance he's been hit.


579
00:39:52.623 --> 00:39:53.723
He's local.

580
00:39:53.725 --> 00:39:56.359
The feds have a net set up
around town, so he's here.


581
00:39:56.961 --> 00:39:58.595
Also, Jim, he, um...

582
00:40:00.097 --> 00:40:01.097
He removed their fingers.

583
00:40:01.966 --> 00:40:03.066
Fingers?

584
00:40:03.701 --> 00:40:05.268
Yep. From each
and everyone of them.


585
00:40:05.270 --> 00:40:07.337
- Even the bird.
- The bird?


586
00:40:07.938 --> 00:40:09.038
Bird. Yeah.

587
00:40:09.773 --> 00:40:11.040
The woman.

588
00:40:11.042 --> 00:40:13.343
Oh, right. I keep
forgetting you're a Brit.


589
00:40:13.711 --> 00:40:15.511
Let's let the fuckers bleed
to death for this.


590
00:40:16.947 --> 00:40:18.181
The same finger?

591
00:40:18.782 --> 00:40:21.150
Yeah. The, uh,
wedding band finger.


592
00:40:21.819 --> 00:40:23.619
We're gonna need some more FBI
guys down here.


593
00:40:24.188 --> 00:40:26.789
How is he picking them?
That's what I wanna know.


594
00:40:27.024 --> 00:40:29.826
There's no way he could know which
agents the FBI would send there.


595
00:40:29.828 --> 00:40:31.995
It's totally at random.
They could be from anywhere.


596
00:40:31.997 --> 00:40:33.830
No, it's the opportunity.

597
00:40:35.099 --> 00:40:36.332
Could've been these five.

598
00:40:36.334 --> 00:40:38.134
Could've been the goddamn
cleaning staff.


599
00:40:38.402 --> 00:40:39.869
But he is escalating
the numbers.


600
00:40:41.238 --> 00:40:42.338
Till he gets to how many?

601
00:40:43.374 --> 00:40:44.874
Maybe the number doesn't matter.

602
00:40:45.309 --> 00:40:46.909
Maybe they're getting close
to something.


603
00:40:48.312 --> 00:40:50.346
Fullard, photograph all
the notes these guys had.


604
00:40:50.348 --> 00:40:51.781
Maybe they were on to something.

605
00:40:52.850 --> 00:40:54.817
Yeah, well, the press
is gonna want a release.


606
00:40:54.952 --> 00:40:55.952
Yeah, yeah.

607
00:40:57.154 --> 00:40:59.055
But if they were wanted
by the cops,


608
00:40:59.057 --> 00:41:01.024
why risk everything
by coming back in here.


609
00:41:01.026 --> 00:41:02.959
No, we were all out there.
All of us.


610
00:41:02.961 --> 00:41:04.060
Hunting him down.

611
00:41:05.295 --> 00:41:06.829
Streets would've
been full of cops.


612
00:41:07.031 --> 00:41:08.765
But this place was quiet.

613
00:41:08.932 --> 00:41:10.033
Exactly.

614
00:41:11.335 --> 00:41:13.169
Anything else?

615
00:41:13.171 --> 00:41:15.531
I'll let you know when I get
the results of the blood tests.


616
00:41:17.107 --> 00:41:18.107
Happy hunting, Jim.

617
00:41:18.308 --> 00:41:19.308
Thanks.

618
00:41:20.744 --> 00:41:22.264
Yeah, there is actually
something else.


619
00:41:24.748 --> 00:41:26.449
Farmer Peterson's raging mad.

620
00:41:26.984 --> 00:41:28.084
About what?

621
00:41:28.352 --> 00:41:30.053
Says his geese were killed.

622
00:41:30.354 --> 00:41:33.289
Is this guy for real?
Take a fucking number.


623
00:41:35.025 --> 00:41:36.125
That's what I thought.

624
00:42:20.104 --> 00:42:22.205
So what are you gonna do
about my geese?


625
00:42:22.207 --> 00:42:23.740
I came out here, there they are.

626
00:42:23.742 --> 00:42:25.074
What are you gonna do about it?

627
00:42:25.076 --> 00:42:26.976
- Yeah. Mr. Peterson..
- That's your job.


628
00:42:26.978 --> 00:42:30.012
I know how you came out and all
your geese were found dead...


629
00:42:30.014 --> 00:42:31.914
No, not all my geese.
Are ya blind? Look.


630
00:42:31.916 --> 00:42:33.316
There's six of them dead. Six.

631
00:42:37.020 --> 00:42:38.254
Hey, did you say six?

632
00:43:41.585 --> 00:43:43.119
Nice try, Joe!

633
00:43:44.354 --> 00:43:45.488
Asshole.

634
00:44:24.962 --> 00:44:26.629
We're checking the CCTV
from the mall,


635
00:44:26.631 --> 00:44:28.931
but it looks like a lot
of cameras aren't working.


636
00:44:29.600 --> 00:44:32.368
There's a lot of places to hide
inside there when the place is open


637
00:44:32.370 --> 00:44:35.438
and a lot of exits
to slip out when it's closed.


638
00:44:35.639 --> 00:44:38.241
But I've got men questioning all
the staff who were left in there.


639
00:44:39.176 --> 00:44:40.176
Something will turn up.

640
00:44:40.911 --> 00:44:42.345
We'll find this guy.

641
00:44:42.347 --> 00:44:45.348
So, sheriff, what are you saying?
No one here's safe?


642
00:44:45.883 --> 00:44:49.051
Look, Lucy, panicking is
exactly what this guy wants.


643
00:44:49.453 --> 00:44:51.254
Well, who do the fingers
belong to?


644
00:44:51.256 --> 00:44:55.024
Uh, that information is not releasable
to the public at the moment.


645
00:44:55.192 --> 00:44:57.126
So you know?

646
00:44:57.128 --> 00:44:58.928
Whatever the reason, this guy's
reaching out to your daughter.


647
00:44:59.263 --> 00:45:01.898
Why would he?
What would he want with me?


648
00:45:02.266 --> 00:45:03.366
I don't know.

649
00:45:03.368 --> 00:45:05.434
The letter... do you
recognize the handwriting?


650
00:45:07.337 --> 00:45:08.437
Why would we know him?

651
00:45:09.006 --> 00:45:10.072
Lucy, I'm just asking.

652
00:45:10.440 --> 00:45:11.674
Anything you know could help.

653
00:45:11.676 --> 00:45:15.211
This is the first time he's
reached out to anyone by name.


654
00:45:17.981 --> 00:45:20.101
We're looking for a connection
and Jennifer may be it.


655
00:45:20.450 --> 00:45:22.351
Are you saying they're
targeting my family?


656
00:45:22.353 --> 00:45:24.320
Do you know of anyone with a
grudge against you?


657
00:45:24.322 --> 00:45:25.454
Particularly at Christmas?

658
00:45:25.456 --> 00:45:26.555
- No.
- No.


659
00:45:29.593 --> 00:45:31.928
I'm putting a unit on your house
and Jen till we catch him.


660
00:45:33.196 --> 00:45:35.298
- Who is he?
- We don't know.


661
00:45:36.166 --> 00:45:38.034
Do we know why he's doing this?

662
00:45:38.036 --> 00:45:39.502
Not yet, but we're
getting closer.


663
00:45:40.404 --> 00:45:42.338
He left Courtney alive.

664
00:45:42.706 --> 00:45:45.341
Have you seen anything strange
in the last few days?


665
00:45:45.575 --> 00:45:46.642
Phone calls?

666
00:45:46.644 --> 00:45:47.644
No.

667
00:45:49.646 --> 00:45:51.981
- What about the name?
- St. Nick?


668
00:45:52.182 --> 00:45:54.016
I assumed it was just a bad
Santa Claus joke.


669
00:45:54.151 --> 00:45:55.484
Joke?

670
00:45:55.719 --> 00:45:58.587
Yeah, sometimes
these killers like to...


671
00:45:59.523 --> 00:46:01.157
Like to hide out in the open.

672
00:46:01.159 --> 00:46:04.026
And it may be someone you know,
so don't go walking around alone


673
00:46:04.028 --> 00:46:05.728
until we nab this creep
and his accomplice.


674
00:46:07.364 --> 00:46:09.298
Jen, time's a factor here.

675
00:46:10.567 --> 00:46:12.234
Would you be willing
to do a polygraph test?


676
00:46:12.236 --> 00:46:14.670
That's enough!

677
00:46:14.672 --> 00:46:15.599
This may be the quickest
way to find out if


678
00:46:15.611 --> 00:46:16.572
she knows anything that
she hasn't said yet.


679
00:46:16.574 --> 00:46:19.508
- I'm calling Rihann Frenchen.
- You can't, Lucy.


680
00:46:19.510 --> 00:46:21.310
I can call a lawyer
anytime I want.


681
00:46:21.312 --> 00:46:23.179
She's not even under arrest,
for Christ's sake.


682
00:46:23.181 --> 00:46:24.480
She's the victim here.

683
00:46:25.749 --> 00:46:27.116
You can't call Rihann Frenchen.

684
00:46:27.118 --> 00:46:28.184
And why the hell not?

685
00:46:30.454 --> 00:46:32.134
Because her whole family
has been murdered.


686
00:46:36.159 --> 00:46:37.493
We're leaving.

687
00:46:38.095 --> 00:46:38.761
- Come on, Jennifer.
- We're not finished...


688
00:46:38.763 --> 00:46:39.996
Come on!

689
00:46:48.271 --> 00:46:49.271
That went well.

690
00:46:49.506 --> 00:46:50.773
Yeah, keep an eye on them.

691
00:46:51.108 --> 00:46:52.608
Well, you don't think
they're suspect?


692
00:46:52.610 --> 00:46:54.210
No, but I got a connection now.

693
00:46:55.278 --> 00:46:57.113
Jen worked at the grotto
at the mall.


694
00:46:57.314 --> 00:46:58.381
First victim.

695
00:46:58.383 --> 00:47:00.516
No, she hasn't worked there
long enough.


696
00:47:00.518 --> 00:47:03.753
I've known Jen my whole life.
I don't think she's involved.


697
00:47:03.755 --> 00:47:05.354
Then maybe someone
connected with her.


698
00:47:07.557 --> 00:47:10.226
- Fullard?
- Uh, yeah.


699
00:47:10.394 --> 00:47:11.394
You with me here?

700
00:47:11.795 --> 00:47:13.295
Yeah. Sorry, I just, uh...

701
00:47:14.264 --> 00:47:15.504
I think it's a weak connection.

702
00:47:15.632 --> 00:47:17.099
Yeah but it's some connection.

703
00:47:18.435 --> 00:47:20.369
The second victim, Troy,
her ex-boyfriend.


704
00:47:21.671 --> 00:47:23.572
And now David Frenchen's
daughter.


705
00:47:24.074 --> 00:47:26.709
That's too much
coincidence for me.


706
00:47:26.711 --> 00:47:28.577
Add to that the fact her best
friend, Courtney,


707
00:47:28.579 --> 00:47:30.546
was the only girl left alive
at the bar attack.


708
00:47:31.448 --> 00:47:33.049
Um... did you get my message?

709
00:47:33.316 --> 00:47:34.817
Mm, no, I've been a little busy.

710
00:47:35.285 --> 00:47:36.318
Farmer Peterson called.

711
00:47:37.220 --> 00:47:39.321
- And?
- Geese have been poisoned.


712
00:47:39.823 --> 00:47:41.824
Is this like the time the
government salted his corn


713
00:47:41.826 --> 00:47:43.526
because he turned in
a UFO report?


714
00:47:43.528 --> 00:47:46.295
Jim. There were six of them.

715
00:47:47.097 --> 00:47:48.564
- Six?
- Yeah.


716
00:47:49.366 --> 00:47:50.466
Oh.

717
00:47:51.401 --> 00:47:53.269
- Good.
- How's that good?


718
00:47:54.171 --> 00:47:55.438
Could've been six dead bodies.

719
00:47:56.139 --> 00:47:57.139
Oh. True.

720
00:47:57.841 --> 00:47:59.575
- Did he see anything?
- No.


721
00:48:54.131 --> 00:48:55.164
Hello?

722
00:49:28.532 --> 00:49:29.532
Is someone there?

723
00:50:28.226 --> 00:50:29.892
<i>Front door, open.</i>

724
00:50:32.696 --> 00:50:33.796
Hello?

725
00:50:36.299 --> 00:50:37.399
Mom?

726
00:50:38.568 --> 00:50:39.668
Dad?

727
00:50:46.276 --> 00:50:47.910
Whoever's there better
show themselves.


728
00:50:49.746 --> 00:50:50.779
Courtney?

729
00:50:51.314 --> 00:50:52.314
Hey.

730
00:50:53.783 --> 00:50:55.417
Is it okay if I...

731
00:50:57.622 --> 00:51:00.389
I didn't wanna be alone.
Even in daylight.


732
00:51:00.624 --> 00:51:03.626
Yeah. It's okay.
You okay?


733
00:51:06.663 --> 00:51:07.663
Aren't you working today?

734
00:51:08.331 --> 00:51:09.531
Shopping mall's closed.

735
00:51:12.636 --> 00:51:13.736
What is it?

736
00:51:15.272 --> 00:51:16.272
Lisa.

737
00:51:17.474 --> 00:51:18.707
She didn't come home last night.

738
00:51:18.709 --> 00:51:19.742
Her parents are worried.

739
00:51:20.944 --> 00:51:22.044
Oh, god.

740
00:51:22.779 --> 00:51:24.380
- Did she call you?
- No.


741
00:51:26.883 --> 00:51:29.418
- We have to stick together.
- Together?


742
00:51:29.919 --> 00:51:32.021
Court, this psycho
is targeting everyone.


743
00:51:32.023 --> 00:51:35.524
Jen, I was with four friends
in a busy bar


744
00:51:35.526 --> 00:51:37.493
and that didn't stop anything.

745
00:51:37.495 --> 00:51:39.061
- We have to do something.
- What?


746
00:51:40.330 --> 00:51:41.864
Let's not wait to be a victim.

747
00:51:43.733 --> 00:51:46.001
Okay. But... but how?

748
00:51:46.003 --> 00:51:47.003
I don't know.

749
00:51:48.938 --> 00:51:49.938
You saw these guys.

750
00:51:51.508 --> 00:51:53.909
Maybe there's some connection
that we're not making


751
00:51:53.911 --> 00:51:55.811
that not even
the sheriff can see.


752
00:51:56.780 --> 00:51:59.982
Everyone so far has had a connection
with either me or my family.


753
00:52:00.917 --> 00:52:02.051
Well, what do you wanna do?

754
00:52:02.619 --> 00:52:03.719
I don't know.

755
00:52:05.622 --> 00:52:07.456
What do we know about Woodridge?

756
00:52:07.791 --> 00:52:10.426
Woodridge.
It's just a sleepy town.


757
00:52:10.428 --> 00:52:12.528
No, no, there's something,
I know there is.


758
00:52:14.464 --> 00:52:16.365
- We should look into it.
- Are you sure?


759
00:52:17.534 --> 00:52:19.835
I'm not gonna be a victim again.

760
00:52:29.913 --> 00:52:33.549
Look, I can assure you we are doing
everything we can to catch the perpetrator.


761
00:52:33.817 --> 00:52:36.652
While the manhunt and
investigation are still ongoing,


762
00:52:36.654 --> 00:52:39.388
I can't give you any information
that would jeopardize that.


763
00:52:39.390 --> 00:52:41.390
Deputy, what about the reports
of the missing girl?


764
00:52:41.392 --> 00:52:43.992
Could it possibly be the work
of this crazed killer?


765
00:52:44.394 --> 00:52:47.730
I can't comment on anything that
will compromise this investigation.


766
00:52:47.732 --> 00:52:50.766
And you guys aren't making it any better
by trying to create panic out there.


767
00:52:50.768 --> 00:52:53.502
Deputy, don't you think your inaction
may have cost them their lives?


768
00:52:53.737 --> 00:52:55.599
Look, me and the team are
working around the clock...


769
00:52:55.624 --> 00:52:56.772
didn't put a curfew in place.

770
00:52:56.774 --> 00:52:58.326
The mayor is saying
it should have been


771
00:52:58.338 --> 00:53:00.254
implemented the moment the
first body was found.


772
00:53:01.411 --> 00:53:02.945
Did that come
out of the mayor's mouth?


773
00:53:02.947 --> 00:53:04.913
Sure did.
Care to comment?


774
00:53:05.115 --> 00:53:06.482
We'll see about that.

775
00:53:06.484 --> 00:53:08.450
Don't... sheriff?

776
00:53:20.697 --> 00:53:22.431
They're like jackals in there.

777
00:53:22.433 --> 00:53:24.566
You got some fucking nerve!

778
00:53:26.703 --> 00:53:28.771
You useless sack of shit!

779
00:53:28.773 --> 00:53:31.807
You've been nothing but a hindrance
in this entire investigation!


780
00:53:31.809 --> 00:53:34.518
If I catch this asshole,
you best hope I don't


781
00:53:34.530 --> 00:53:36.845
try to indict your
ass for obstruction!


782
00:53:36.847 --> 00:53:38.180
- Jim!
- You wouldn't dare.


783
00:53:38.182 --> 00:53:40.082
- Try me.
- -Jim!


784
00:53:40.784 --> 00:53:42.584
I want you gone
by the end of the day!


785
00:53:42.852 --> 00:53:44.686
- Listen, mayor...
- Can it!


786
00:53:46.456 --> 00:53:48.824
Sheriff Mitchell
is relieved of his duties.


787
00:53:48.826 --> 00:53:50.559
You are temporary sheriff.

788
00:53:51.161 --> 00:53:53.162
And you have a drinking problem.

789
00:53:53.164 --> 00:53:55.097
And it just will not do anymore.

790
00:53:55.698 --> 00:53:58.967
I no longer have any faith in your
ability to perform your duties.


791
00:53:59.569 --> 00:54:00.702
Now, I'm outta here.

792
00:54:02.472 --> 00:54:04.740
I'm going to my son's
bachelor party


793
00:54:04.742 --> 00:54:08.076
and by the time I'm back,
I want you gone!


794
00:54:09.612 --> 00:54:10.712
Prick.

795
00:54:15.118 --> 00:54:16.118
- No handcuffs.
- Okay.


796
00:54:19.155 --> 00:54:20.589
Nice fucking shot.

797
00:54:26.696 --> 00:54:27.963
So...

798
00:54:30.133 --> 00:54:31.567
So what happened
to Peterson today?


799
00:54:32.635 --> 00:54:34.470
Ah, something was vandalized.

800
00:54:34.637 --> 00:54:36.004
Vandalized?

801
00:54:36.006 --> 00:54:38.841
Yeah, some milking machines
or some shit like that.


802
00:54:43.179 --> 00:54:44.680
Peterson's an asshole.

803
00:54:46.216 --> 00:54:47.850
He's almost as popular as I am.

804
00:54:50.020 --> 00:54:51.820
Come on, let's go get a coffee.

805
00:54:53.690 --> 00:54:54.690
Yeah.

806
00:54:57.495 --> 00:55:00.162
The sheriff's department has issued
an urgent plea to the public


807
00:55:00.164 --> 00:55:02.244
for help with their
investigations into the killings.


808
00:55:02.699 --> 00:55:04.566
If you have any information
you think may help,


809
00:55:04.568 --> 00:55:06.602
contact Woodridge pd
immediately.


810
00:56:00.957 --> 00:56:01.654
What?

811
00:56:01.666 --> 00:56:03.792
Lisa swan's parents
are freaking out, Jim.


812
00:56:04.060 --> 00:56:05.594
Did we get a unit
over to the pool?


813
00:56:05.596 --> 00:56:06.695
I went myself.

814
00:56:07.130 --> 00:56:08.564
Turns out she was
the last one...


815
00:56:11.000 --> 00:56:14.169
Turns out she was the last one there,
to do some extra swim practice,


816
00:56:14.171 --> 00:56:16.238
which isn't unusual,
but then nothing.


817
00:56:16.940 --> 00:56:18.006
CCTV?

818
00:56:18.008 --> 00:56:19.107
Disabled.

819
00:56:19.742 --> 00:56:20.842
Anything else?

820
00:56:22.078 --> 00:56:24.179
Yeah, we found swans
in the pool.


821
00:56:24.181 --> 00:56:26.248
- What?
- Little toy swans.


822
00:56:26.883 --> 00:56:28.116
Oh. Good.

823
00:56:28.785 --> 00:56:29.885
How's that good?

824
00:56:30.954 --> 00:56:31.994
Could've been bodies, Sam.

825
00:56:35.091 --> 00:56:37.225
Hey, what do you want me
to tell Lisa swan's parents?


826
00:56:39.696 --> 00:56:40.696
Where did this come from?

827
00:56:41.297 --> 00:56:42.297
Sam!

828
00:56:47.103 --> 00:56:48.203
What?

829
00:56:49.639 --> 00:56:51.479
Hey, does anybody else
know about this red box?


830
00:57:05.321 --> 00:57:07.055
Jim, we should get
bomb squad on this.


831
00:57:09.225 --> 00:57:10.359
It's not his style.

832
00:57:56.372 --> 00:57:57.673
What the hell is that?

833
00:59:08.311 --> 00:59:10.412
I told you I'd
keep the mall open.


834
00:59:10.414 --> 00:59:12.280
Hey, this is on me.

835
00:59:32.335 --> 00:59:37.072
So do you want me
to be naughty or nice?


836
00:59:38.074 --> 00:59:40.308
I've always liked naughty girls.

837
00:59:40.310 --> 00:59:42.811
What do you want for Christmas?

838
00:59:43.513 --> 00:59:46.381
I want you.
Unwrapped.


839
00:59:49.185 --> 00:59:52.554
And I wanna find these crazies
that are killing our taxpayers.


840
00:59:55.124 --> 00:59:57.526
Well, it's your lucky day.

841
00:59:57.528 --> 00:59:59.094
Why is that?

842
01:00:02.900 --> 01:00:05.534
Because Santa Claus
is coming to town!


843
01:00:08.005 --> 01:00:11.239
Oh, this is not gonna be good
for the local economy.


844
01:00:18.214 --> 01:00:19.481
Have fun, baby!

845
01:00:29.025 --> 01:00:31.293
Merry Christmas, everyone!

846
01:00:40.036 --> 01:00:41.536
What the fuck?

847
01:00:50.279 --> 01:00:53.949
Dispatch. I need a unit right
away over to vixens strip club.


848
01:00:54.183 --> 01:00:55.450
Multiple 1-8-7s.

849
01:00:56.519 --> 01:00:58.053
It isn't... it's not live.

850
01:01:05.261 --> 01:01:06.394
Ah, fuck.

851
01:01:08.965 --> 01:01:09.965
What do we do now?

852
01:01:13.302 --> 01:01:14.302
Call the coroner.

853
01:01:15.972 --> 01:01:17.439
Tell him to bring
a lot of body bags.


854
01:01:20.977 --> 01:01:23.912
Jen, I don't know.
We've been at it for hours


855
01:01:23.914 --> 01:01:25.380
and we still haven't
found anything.


856
01:01:28.317 --> 01:01:31.119
- There's plenty of murders just...
- nothing this gruesome.


857
01:01:31.954 --> 01:01:33.255
Shit.

858
01:01:33.257 --> 01:01:34.456
I don't know.

859
01:01:35.191 --> 01:01:36.992
Have you tried searching
your parents?


860
01:01:37.393 --> 01:01:38.560
My parents?

861
01:01:38.562 --> 01:01:40.362
Yeah, I mean,
they're whiter than white,


862
01:01:40.364 --> 01:01:42.964
but we all know our parents
are just as fucked up as we are.


863
01:01:43.299 --> 01:01:44.332
Hey, it's worth a shot.

864
01:01:54.977 --> 01:01:55.977
Is that your mom?

865
01:01:57.013 --> 01:01:58.113
Yeah.

866
01:01:59.949 --> 01:02:01.349
Who's that guy?

867
01:02:06.455 --> 01:02:09.324
<i>A state of emergency has now been
declared in northeast New York</i>


868
01:02:09.326 --> 01:02:14.029
<i>as a record nine feet of snow has
effectively buried some towns and roads.</i>


869
01:02:14.031 --> 01:02:18.300
<i>St. Lawrence, Jefferson and Lewis counties
are still the most badly affected.</i>


870
01:02:18.302 --> 01:02:23.338
<i>With many towns in Lewis now
completely inaccessible, even by air.</i>


871
01:02:23.340 --> 01:02:27.475
<i>This, of course, means that residents
in the community of Woodridge</i>


872
01:02:27.477 --> 01:02:29.311
<i>are effectively on their own</i>

873
01:02:29.313 --> 01:02:33.114
<i>trapped in extreme weather in this
town with the Christmas killer</i>


874
01:02:33.116 --> 01:02:38.219
<i>still at large after
slaughtering five FBI agents.</i>


875
01:02:38.221 --> 01:02:41.256
<i>With the weather not likely
to improve for several days,</i>


876
01:02:41.258 --> 01:02:44.492
<i>it's difficult not to feel sorry
for those who are trapped...</i>


877
01:02:46.262 --> 01:02:47.462
There's a storm coming.

878
01:02:48.397 --> 01:02:49.965
Ah, for Christ's sakes, Fullard.

879
01:02:50.132 --> 01:02:52.434
No need to get so melodramatic
about the whole issue.


880
01:02:53.169 --> 01:02:55.503
Um, I mean there's
an actual storm coming.


881
01:02:55.505 --> 01:02:58.540
You know, bad weather, falling
trees, blizzards, et cetera?


882
01:02:58.741 --> 01:03:00.575
I think that's really gonna
delay the new feds.


883
01:03:00.577 --> 01:03:02.110
Great.

884
01:03:02.112 --> 01:03:04.980
They get anything back from the
lab on the DNA for that apple?


885
01:03:04.982 --> 01:03:08.550
Pear? No, we didn't really
pull anything off the swab.


886
01:03:08.751 --> 01:03:10.871
Didn't get any fingerprints
that were any good either.


887
01:03:13.155 --> 01:03:14.356
Say again?

888
01:03:14.690 --> 01:03:16.358
I mean, like,
the swab wasn't very good.


889
01:03:17.159 --> 01:03:18.493
And the fingerprints...

890
01:03:18.995 --> 01:03:20.462
We don't have the kind of
database to do...


891
01:03:20.464 --> 01:03:22.163
No, no, no, no.
Not that part.


892
01:03:23.599 --> 01:03:24.766
Did you say pear?

893
01:03:25.401 --> 01:03:27.302
- Yeah.
- I thought it was an apple.


894
01:03:28.170 --> 01:03:30.305
Well, so did I, but it's a pear.

895
01:03:32.108 --> 01:03:33.108
Why?

896
01:03:33.576 --> 01:03:34.676
Pear?

897
01:03:36.078 --> 01:03:38.246
Pear... pear tree.

898
01:03:38.647 --> 01:03:42.584
- Uh... what was his name?
- Who?


899
01:03:42.586 --> 01:03:46.254
The mall Santa... the guy...
The Santa at the mall.


900
01:03:46.256 --> 01:03:48.123
- Come on, come on.
- I got it. Got it here.


901
01:03:48.724 --> 01:03:50.125
- Uh...
- Come on.


902
01:03:50.459 --> 01:03:52.460
- James.
- James? James what?


903
01:03:52.462 --> 01:03:53.561
- Partridge.
- Ja...


904
01:03:57.733 --> 01:04:00.769
Wake everybody up.
I've got it.


905
01:04:01.270 --> 01:04:02.370
Got what?

906
01:04:02.372 --> 01:04:05.507
How the son of a bitch
is targeting people.


907
01:04:21.123 --> 01:04:23.458
Sheriff, they're, uh, coming in
but the storm...


908
01:04:24.260 --> 01:04:25.160
Yeah, yeah.

909
01:04:25.162 --> 01:04:27.429
We've been looking
at this all wrong.


910
01:04:27.431 --> 01:04:30.799
We've been expecting the number
of murders to match the day,


911
01:04:31.467 --> 01:04:33.701
with a link to Jennifer
and her family.


912
01:04:35.137 --> 01:04:36.371
But there's more to it
than that.


913
01:04:36.373 --> 01:04:38.173
Sheriff, what are you
talking about?


914
01:04:38.175 --> 01:04:40.456
"On the first day of Christmas,
my true love gave to me...


915
01:04:41.143 --> 01:04:44.345
- A partridge in a pear tree."
- Oh shit.


916
01:04:44.347 --> 01:04:47.215
"On the second day of Christmas,
my true love gave to me,


917
01:04:47.217 --> 01:04:49.851
two turtle doves."
Turtle dove point.


918
01:04:51.288 --> 01:04:53.688
"Three French hens"...
The Frenchens.


919
01:04:53.690 --> 01:04:54.756
Three of them.

920
01:04:54.758 --> 01:04:56.691
What is it?

921
01:04:56.693 --> 01:04:58.827
Uh, the song. I can't
remember the... the, uh...


922
01:04:58.829 --> 01:05:01.763
- The lines...
- "Four calling birds."


923
01:05:01.765 --> 01:05:03.264
"Four calling birds."

924
01:05:03.766 --> 01:05:06.234
<i>"Birds," the British term
for girls.</i>


925
01:05:06.236 --> 01:05:07.635
<i>Four birds. 
Four women.</i>

926
01:05:07.637 --> 01:05:09.637
Which is why they left
Courtney alive.


927
01:05:12.208 --> 01:05:13.208
Oh fuck!

928
01:05:14.477 --> 01:05:15.577
"Five golden rings."

929
01:05:17.379 --> 01:05:18.813
The FBI guys.

930
01:05:18.815 --> 01:05:21.249
- Peterson's geese!
- "Six geese a-laying."


931
01:05:25.287 --> 01:05:27.288
"Seven swans a-swimming."

932
01:05:29.425 --> 01:05:31.359
Then something doesn't match up
here, 'cause last I checked,


933
01:05:31.361 --> 01:05:33.328
we didn't have eight
milk maids killed.


934
01:05:33.762 --> 01:05:36.397
No, I'm wrong.
Peterson's farm.


935
01:05:36.399 --> 01:05:40.435
There's a spot at the back.
Eight milk maid machines.


936
01:05:40.437 --> 01:05:41.603
Completely destroyed.

937
01:05:41.837 --> 01:05:43.705
Umm... "Nine ladies dancing!"

938
01:05:44.340 --> 01:05:45.673
<i>The strippers at the ViXen club.</i>

939
01:05:45.675 --> 01:05:47.742
Uh... "Ten lords a leaping."

940
01:05:47.744 --> 01:05:50.378
The mayor's son's bachelor party.
Ten of them dead.


941
01:05:50.380 --> 01:05:52.514
This is good, good, good. Umm...

942
01:05:52.516 --> 01:05:54.315
It's not over yet though, Jim.

943
01:05:55.484 --> 01:05:57.318
There's twelve days
of Christmas.


944
01:05:57.320 --> 01:05:58.887
There's still two lines left
in that song.


945
01:05:58.889 --> 01:06:00.855
Yeah, I know.
But he's local.


946
01:06:00.857 --> 01:06:02.924
- He has to be.
- Yeah but how can you be sure?


947
01:06:03.425 --> 01:06:05.160
Peterson's geese.

948
01:06:05.427 --> 01:06:07.462
Uh... swans in a swimming pool,

949
01:06:07.464 --> 01:06:11.833
five FBI agents show up for
their fingers to be hacked off.


950
01:06:13.335 --> 01:06:14.936
Yeah. He's local.

951
01:06:15.804 --> 01:06:18.239
Or he knows somebody who is.

952
01:06:18.241 --> 01:06:20.241
You have to have access
to Peterson's farm


953
01:06:20.609 --> 01:06:22.210
to get in twice
without being spotted.


954
01:06:24.613 --> 01:06:27.013
Which is right next
to Jen's old house.


955
01:06:28.284 --> 01:06:28.933
The swimming pool is...

956
01:06:28.945 --> 01:06:30.451
I'll be right back, sheriff.
I gotta check something.


957
01:06:30.453 --> 01:06:32.620
Yeah, yeah.
The swimming pool...


958
01:06:32.622 --> 01:06:34.722
Swimming pool... swimming pool.

959
01:06:36.959 --> 01:06:37.959
Kathy!

960
01:06:38.961 --> 01:06:41.362
Let's get some
Christmas music in here.


961
01:06:41.630 --> 01:06:43.264
Did he just say Christmas music?

962
01:06:45.268 --> 01:06:46.568
<i>Front door, open.</i>

963
01:06:49.738 --> 01:06:53.241
Hey! Have you eaten yet?

964
01:06:58.914 --> 01:06:59.914
Jen?

965
01:07:01.684 --> 01:07:03.551
Who's sergeant Nicholas Conway?

966
01:07:08.857 --> 01:07:09.857
Oh, god.

967
01:07:16.665 --> 01:07:17.765
Mom?

968
01:07:19.335 --> 01:07:21.936
You know that frank and I
love you very much.


969
01:07:21.938 --> 01:07:24.806
Mom, I need to know.
What is this?


970
01:07:26.375 --> 01:07:27.642
When I was younger...

971
01:07:29.712 --> 01:07:32.747
Before I met your... frank...

972
01:07:37.519 --> 01:07:38.519
I was married.

973
01:07:40.456 --> 01:07:41.556
To who?

974
01:07:42.391 --> 01:07:43.491
Nick Conway.

975
01:07:43.493 --> 01:07:48.496
He was a very popular guy and...
He was in the British military.


976
01:07:49.365 --> 01:07:50.565
Handsome.

977
01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:52.000
He, um...

978
01:07:53.402 --> 01:07:54.902
He came back from the Gulf war.

979
01:07:57.273 --> 01:08:00.041
Kosovo, places I've never
even heard of and, uh...


980
01:08:01.810 --> 01:08:03.611
He changed, Jen. He...

981
01:08:04.580 --> 01:08:07.849
He became... mean.

982
01:08:08.417 --> 01:08:09.417
Nasty.

983
01:08:10.019 --> 01:08:11.352
I was terrified.

984
01:08:11.354 --> 01:08:13.021
I...

985
01:08:13.023 --> 01:08:15.823
I tried to make
a happy life with him.


986
01:08:16.392 --> 01:08:18.826
He used to say he was like
a bullet in a chamber


987
01:08:18.828 --> 01:08:20.461
and the trigger had been pulled.

988
01:08:21.697 --> 01:08:22.897
What did he do?

989
01:08:26.035 --> 01:08:27.468
On Christmas Eve...

990
01:08:28.370 --> 01:08:29.370
He, um...

991
01:08:32.074 --> 01:08:33.074
He attacked me.

992
01:08:34.743 --> 01:08:36.544
- Tried to murder me.
- God.


993
01:08:36.546 --> 01:08:38.680
- He came at me with a knife.
- Jesus!


994
01:08:39.515 --> 01:08:40.515
The police...

995
01:08:41.817 --> 01:08:43.318
They arrested him.

996
01:08:43.320 --> 01:08:45.086
I
-I had to leave him.

997
01:08:45.788 --> 01:08:46.888
Mom?

998
01:08:47.589 --> 01:08:48.589
I'm sorry.

999
01:08:51.994 --> 01:08:52.994
I divorced him.

1000
01:08:55.597 --> 01:08:58.666
And Mrs. Frenchen?
She represented you.


1001
01:09:00.469 --> 01:09:02.770
That's why you always refer
to her as your lawyer


1002
01:09:02.772 --> 01:09:04.639
even though she only did
divorce cases?


1003
01:09:04.641 --> 01:09:05.641
That's right.

1004
01:09:07.409 --> 01:09:09.049
And this happened
at Christmas, didn't it?


1005
01:09:10.646 --> 01:09:12.847
Served divorce papers
on Christmas day.


1006
01:09:15.784 --> 01:09:17.685
He said that I had
broken up the family.


1007
01:09:17.953 --> 01:09:19.020
Christ!

1008
01:09:19.855 --> 01:09:21.589
He went off the deep end.

1009
01:09:21.591 --> 01:09:24.892
They, uh, took him to a mental
institution to get help.


1010
01:09:25.561 --> 01:09:26.661
And he escaped?

1011
01:09:27.463 --> 01:09:28.830
No. That's just it.

1012
01:09:29.865 --> 01:09:32.667
The mental institution burned
down three years ago.


1013
01:09:32.669 --> 01:09:34.102
Nick Conway died.

1014
01:09:35.437 --> 01:09:38.106
- At least I...
- You thought he died?


1015
01:09:39.475 --> 01:09:41.709
They found all of his teeth
in the ashes.


1016
01:09:42.578 --> 01:09:44.545
I mean, they wrote a death
certificate


1017
01:09:44.547 --> 01:09:48.082
based on all of his teeth
and a burnt corpse.


1018
01:09:48.084 --> 01:09:50.051
Well, clearly,
he didn't die, mom.


1019
01:09:50.586 --> 01:09:51.686
He's out!

1020
01:09:52.488 --> 01:09:53.721
He's out.

1021
01:09:56.492 --> 01:09:57.492
Wait...

1022
01:09:58.627 --> 01:09:59.827
That's not it, is it?

1023
01:10:01.563 --> 01:10:04.065
I'm sorry, Jen.
I should've told you the truth.


1024
01:10:04.533 --> 01:10:05.666
What truth?

1025
01:10:07.469 --> 01:10:08.469
Wait...

1026
01:10:09.671 --> 01:10:11.939
You said he said you'd
broken up the family.


1027
01:10:12.741 --> 01:10:14.776
But if it were just
the two of you,


1028
01:10:14.778 --> 01:10:16.844
that's not a family,
that's a marriage.


1029
01:10:18.180 --> 01:10:19.180
God.

1030
01:10:21.950 --> 01:10:23.651
When I left him...

1031
01:10:24.753 --> 01:10:27.054
- I was pregnant.
- No.


1032
01:10:27.189 --> 01:10:29.190
- Nick Conway is...
- No!


1033
01:10:29.192 --> 01:10:31.893
I'm sorry, Jen.
I should've told you sooner.


1034
01:10:32.628 --> 01:10:35.863
So my biological father
is a raving lunatic?!


1035
01:10:35.865 --> 01:10:38.833
Jen, you're not your father's daughter!
You're nothing like him!


1036
01:10:38.835 --> 01:10:41.002
He's killing people, mom,
so what does he want?!


1037
01:10:42.871 --> 01:10:44.911
If he wants the same thing
as when he was committed,


1038
01:10:45.808 --> 01:10:47.575
he wants us
to be a family again.


1039
01:10:51.079 --> 01:10:53.039
Well, clearly we're not that
dissimilar after all.


1040
01:11:12.501 --> 01:11:14.001
<i>Front door, open.</i>

1041
01:11:21.477 --> 01:11:22.710
Why didn't you say anything?

1042
01:11:23.078 --> 01:11:25.246
You know why.
He's dead.


1043
01:11:26.748 --> 01:11:28.082
Then there's no harm
in telling anyone,


1044
01:11:28.084 --> 01:11:29.717
if that's what you believe.

1045
01:11:29.719 --> 01:11:32.887
He's dead.
They found all his teeth.


1046
01:11:32.889 --> 01:11:34.622
Was it conclusive?

1047
01:11:34.624 --> 01:11:39.227
They found enough teeth and blood for the
coroner to say his death was very probable.


1048
01:11:39.229 --> 01:11:40.561
Probable.

1049
01:11:40.563 --> 01:11:42.230
Lucy, they never found a body.

1050
01:11:44.733 --> 01:11:46.801
Sam, please.

1051
01:11:47.603 --> 01:11:49.803
Do you think I wanted to believe
this shit is happening?


1052
01:11:50.506 --> 01:11:52.607
Last time I saw this guy
in action he killed...


1053
01:11:53.809 --> 01:11:57.778
He killed my best friend
in cold blood for no reason.


1054
01:11:57.780 --> 01:11:58.880
I know.

1055
01:12:00.582 --> 01:12:02.650
We just put all this stuff
behind us.


1056
01:12:02.851 --> 01:12:03.851
Does frank know?

1057
01:12:04.520 --> 01:12:06.787
- What would I tell him?
- The truth, Lucy.


1058
01:12:08.590 --> 01:12:10.791
It's not your fault
this guy lost his mind.


1059
01:12:10.793 --> 01:12:12.193
And what would I tell Jen?

1060
01:12:13.128 --> 01:12:14.829
That her father's a psychopath?

1061
01:12:14.831 --> 01:12:16.197
At least she'd be prepared.

1062
01:12:16.199 --> 01:12:17.098
For this?

1063
01:12:17.100 --> 01:12:18.633
It could be him.

1064
01:12:20.035 --> 01:12:21.135
He's dead.

1065
01:12:21.137 --> 01:12:24.805
If that's what you believe,
then why not tell the sheriff?


1066
01:12:25.674 --> 01:12:26.774
Because...

1067
01:12:28.043 --> 01:12:30.077
I'm not so sure I believe that.

1068
01:12:31.313 --> 01:12:33.247
- You should tell the sheriff.
- No!


1069
01:12:33.249 --> 01:12:35.283
- Why?
- Think of Jennifer.


1070
01:12:35.285 --> 01:12:37.118
I am thinking of Jennifer!

1071
01:12:41.223 --> 01:12:42.657
If it is Nick Conway...

1072
01:12:44.293 --> 01:12:47.061
Then we know exactly what direction
that attack is gonna come from


1073
01:12:47.563 --> 01:12:49.664
and that's more than we've
got to go on right now.


1074
01:12:50.966 --> 01:12:53.334
There was a girl with him,
too, right?


1075
01:12:53.336 --> 01:12:54.336
Yeah.

1076
01:12:56.838 --> 01:12:58.239
But we don't know
who she is yet.


1077
01:12:59.675 --> 01:13:00.675
I might.

1078
01:13:02.177 --> 01:13:03.177
What?

1079
01:13:04.746 --> 01:13:05.846
How?

1080
01:13:06.582 --> 01:13:07.582
If it is him...

1081
01:13:09.585 --> 01:13:11.218
Then the girl could be
the only other body


1082
01:13:11.220 --> 01:13:13.254
that was unaccounted for
in the wreckage.


1083
01:13:13.855 --> 01:13:15.089
Who is she?

1084
01:13:15.091 --> 01:13:17.158
Criminally insane and guilty

1085
01:13:17.160 --> 01:13:19.594
- of three counts of murder.
- Jesus, Lucy.


1086
01:13:21.797 --> 01:13:22.797
All right.

1087
01:13:24.766 --> 01:13:26.046
I have to go
check something out.


1088
01:13:29.671 --> 01:13:31.339
There's a patrol car outside.

1089
01:13:33.041 --> 01:13:34.121
Got nothing to worry about.

1090
01:13:35.143 --> 01:13:36.811
Sam, I've messed it all up.

1091
01:13:36.979 --> 01:13:37.979
Not yet.

1092
01:13:39.615 --> 01:13:41.148
We still got time
to get through this.


1093
01:13:41.150 --> 01:13:43.217
Wait here.
Wait by the phone.


1094
01:14:05.641 --> 01:14:08.409
<i>The change in the storm front
over northeast New York</i>

01:14:45.914 --> 01:14:48.282
It's Lucy, uh, Jen's mom.

1103
01:14:50.018 --> 01:14:51.252
Listen.

1104
01:14:51.254 --> 01:14:53.387
I think I know who's been
doing all of this.


1105
01:14:55.857 --> 01:14:58.392
I think it's Jen's
biological father.


1106
01:14:58.994 --> 01:15:03.364
And she didn't know and
she's out there all alone...


1107
01:15:17.145 --> 01:15:18.245
Frank?

1108
01:15:19.047 --> 01:15:20.481
The phone's gone dead.

1109
01:15:25.420 --> 01:15:28.022
The storm probably took out
the local cell phone tower.


1110
01:15:34.863 --> 01:15:36.230
<i>Front door, open.</i>

1111
01:15:36.232 --> 01:15:38.032
Oh, god.

1112
01:15:38.366 --> 01:15:39.366
Jen?

1113
01:15:51.046 --> 01:15:52.346
Hello?

1114
01:16:02.991 --> 01:16:06.193
Frank?!

1115
01:16:06.195 --> 01:16:08.429
- <i>Front door, open.</i>

1116
01:16:15.904 --> 01:16:16.904
Frank?!

1117
01:16:59.848 --> 01:17:02.349
Merry Christmas, sweetheart!

1118
01:17:03.486 --> 01:17:05.853
- Frank!
- Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa!


1119
01:17:05.855 --> 01:17:07.955
Frank!
Oh, no, no, no.


1120
01:17:07.957 --> 01:17:10.991
Frank isn't joining us
for the rest of his life.


1121
01:17:10.993 --> 01:17:12.927
You need a new husband!

1122
01:17:12.929 --> 01:17:14.829
Please, Nick.

1123
01:17:14.831 --> 01:17:17.531
Oh, I'm just kidding!

1124
01:17:17.533 --> 01:17:18.999
I'm not gonna hurt you,
sweetheart.


1125
01:17:19.001 --> 01:17:21.268
You're the mother of my child!

1126
01:17:21.270 --> 01:17:23.070
What do you want?

1127
01:17:23.072 --> 01:17:26.140
Well, just to get the family
back together over the holidays!


1128
01:17:27.475 --> 01:17:29.510
Hey! There she is!

1129
01:17:45.126 --> 01:17:46.894
All we're missing is mistletoe!

1130
01:17:48.064 --> 01:17:50.231
You...

1131
01:17:51.132 --> 01:17:53.968
Are gonna love what
I got you for Christmas.


1132
01:17:53.970 --> 01:17:55.436
Is it a bear trap?

1133
01:17:55.937 --> 01:17:57.471
Well, why don't we wait and see?

1134
01:17:57.473 --> 01:18:00.608
Let's get frank down here
and get this party started!


1135
01:18:22.931 --> 01:18:23.931
Still nothing?

1136
01:18:24.232 --> 01:18:25.232
No.

1137
01:18:27.068 --> 01:18:30.137
Let's just try and
enjoy this night, okay?


1138
01:18:30.139 --> 01:18:32.406
Yeah, it's okay, Jen.
Nothing to worry about.


1139
01:18:40.415 --> 01:18:42.917
<i>Dispatch to 3-9-2.
Please check in.</i>


1140
01:18:44.419 --> 01:18:47.021
3-9-2,<i>this is dispatch.</i>
<i>Check in, please.</i>


1141
01:18:48.523 --> 01:18:49.657
<i>3-9-2, come in.</i>

1142
01:18:51.359 --> 01:18:52.426
<i>Bobby, you there?</i>

1143
01:19:12.314 --> 01:19:14.048
Sheriff, pipers piping.

1144
01:19:14.050 --> 01:19:17.318
<i>- Dispatch to 2-7-4.</i>
- Copy that.


1145
01:19:18.420 --> 01:19:21.255
<i>2-7-4, please proceed to mount
drive and check on officer Davies.</i>


1146
01:19:21.257 --> 01:19:23.223
<i>We just got a message
from the house,</i>


1147
01:19:23.225 --> 01:19:25.526
<i>but the phone line is now dead
and Davies isn't checking in.</i>


1148
01:19:25.528 --> 01:19:26.593
Understood.

1149
01:19:30.465 --> 01:19:33.567
<i>"'Twas the night before Christmas,
when all through the house.</i>


1150
01:19:34.135 --> 01:19:37.338
<i>Not a creature was stirring,
not even a mouse.</i>


1151
01:19:37.706 --> 01:19:40.474
<i>The stockings were hung
by the chimney with care,</i>


1152
01:19:40.476 --> 01:19:43.978
<i>in the hopes that Saint
Nicholas would soon be there.</i>


1153
01:19:44.980 --> 01:19:47.514
<i>The children were nestled,
all snug in their beds,</i>


1154
01:19:48.316 --> 01:19:51.385
<i>while visions of sugar plums
danced in their heads."</i>


1155
01:19:52.220 --> 01:19:54.722
Ten, nine, eight...

1156
01:20:00.328 --> 01:20:03.230
<i>"And mamma in her
handkerchief and I in my cap,</i>


1157
01:20:03.232 --> 01:20:06.734
<i>had just settled our brains
for a long winter's nap."</i>


1158
01:20:06.736 --> 01:20:08.702
Seven, six...

1159
01:20:09.104 --> 01:20:11.538
<i>"When out on the lawn
there rose such a clatter,</i>


1160
01:20:11.540 --> 01:20:14.241
<i>I sprang from the bed
to see what was the matter.</i>


1161
01:20:15.243 --> 01:20:17.211
<i>Away to the window I flew
like a flash,</i>


1162
01:20:17.213 --> 01:20:20.447
<i>tore open the shutters
and threw out the sash.</i>


1163
01:20:20.449 --> 01:20:23.017
<i>The moon on the breast
of the new fallen snow,</i>


1164
01:20:23.019 --> 01:20:25.753
<i>gave the luster of mid-day
to the objects below.</i>


1165
01:20:26.554 --> 01:20:29.456
<i>When what to my wandering eye
should appear,</i>


1166
01:20:30.125 --> 01:20:32.726
<i>but a miniature sleigh
and eight tiny reindeer."</i>


1167
01:20:32.728 --> 01:20:34.661
<i>Five, four...</i>

1168
01:20:35.463 --> 01:20:38.499
<i>"With a little old driver,
so lively and quick,</i>


1169
01:20:38.501 --> 01:20:41.535
<i>I knew in a moment,
it must be Saint Nick.</i>


1170
01:20:43.104 --> 01:20:45.773
<i>He spoke not a word,
but went straight to his work</i>


1171
01:20:46.474 --> 01:20:49.376
<i>and filled all the stockings
and then turned with a jerk.</i>


1172
01:20:50.145 --> 01:20:53.047
<i>And laying his finger
aside of his nose,</i>


1173
01:20:53.049 --> 01:20:55.282
<i>and giving a nod,
up the chimney he rose."</i>


1174
01:20:55.284 --> 01:20:57.117
<i>Three, two...</i>

1175
01:20:57.119 --> 01:20:59.820
<i>"He sprung to his sleigh
and to his team gave a whistle,</i>


1176
01:21:00.355 --> 01:21:03.057
<i>and away they all flew,
like the down of a thistle.</i>


1177
01:21:04.793 --> 01:21:07.694
<i>But I heard him exclaim
as he drove out of sight,</i>


1178
01:21:08.596 --> 01:21:10.798
<i>'happy Christmas to all,</i>

1179
01:21:11.499 --> 01:21:13.834
<i>and to all,
a bloody good night!'"</i>


1180
01:21:13.836 --> 01:21:16.737
- one! Merry Christmas!

1181
01:21:28.416 --> 01:21:29.416
Mom?

1182
01:21:30.418 --> 01:21:31.585
Lisa?

1183
01:21:31.587 --> 01:21:33.120
Merry Christmas, everyone!

1184
01:21:34.389 --> 01:21:36.256
Now... who's been naughty?

1185
01:21:38.159 --> 01:21:40.127
Holy shit!

1186
01:21:45.266 --> 01:21:46.700
Joe!

1187
01:21:46.702 --> 01:21:47.835
Let's go! Let's go!

1188
01:22:03.485 --> 01:22:06.587
- Lucy?
- She's not here.


1189
01:22:06.589 --> 01:22:07.589
Why would he take her?

1190
01:22:09.657 --> 01:22:10.858
Eleventh day.

1191
01:22:11.593 --> 01:22:12.726
This is the twelfth.

1192
01:22:14.662 --> 01:22:16.563
"Twelve drummers drumming."

1193
01:22:17.799 --> 01:22:19.766
"Twelve drummers... drumming."

1194
01:22:31.846 --> 01:22:32.846
Shit!

1195
01:22:34.582 --> 01:22:37.584
- They killed Joe.
- We need to move.


1196
01:22:38.219 --> 01:22:40.220
We're not leaving
without mom and Lisa.


1197
01:22:40.222 --> 01:22:41.755
No, we're all
getting outta here.


1198
01:22:41.757 --> 01:22:43.657
- David.
- I'm not leaving you!


1199
01:22:44.459 --> 01:22:46.299
They can't take the person
I love away from me.


1200
01:22:46.728 --> 01:22:47.928
I'm gonna try to
draw them outside.


1201
01:22:47.930 --> 01:22:49.429
Courtney, no.

1202
01:22:49.864 --> 01:22:52.399
We can't be victims again, Jen.

1203
01:22:54.202 --> 01:22:56.336
Hey! Jingle whore!

1204
01:22:56.804 --> 01:22:59.406
You want some?
Well, come get some!


1205
01:22:59.408 --> 01:23:00.440
I'm coming too!

1206
01:23:02.744 --> 01:23:05.345
- I love you.
- I love you, too.


1207
01:23:15.658 --> 01:23:17.925
Come on!
We have to go! Please!


1208
01:23:22.263 --> 01:23:23.263
Come on, get up!

1209
01:23:24.699 --> 01:23:26.366
I can't move!

1210
01:23:26.368 --> 01:23:27.568
Come on! We need to get out...

1211
01:23:45.287 --> 01:23:46.820
Fuck you! Go to hell!

1212
01:23:48.724 --> 01:23:52.726
I like a girl with some spunk!

1213
01:23:53.795 --> 01:23:55.429
- No! No! No!
- Stop!


1214
01:23:59.567 --> 01:24:00.734
There she is.

1215
01:24:00.736 --> 01:24:01.868
Let them go.

1216
01:24:02.570 --> 01:24:03.837
- Go!
- Hey! Get away from her...


1217
01:24:03.839 --> 01:24:04.839
Stop!

1218
01:24:05.607 --> 01:24:06.673
Please.

1219
01:24:07.008 --> 01:24:08.242
No one else.

1220
01:24:08.244 --> 01:24:12.813
What father could ignore the pleas
of his beautiful baby girl?


1221
01:24:12.947 --> 01:24:15.315
If you let them go,
you can take me.


1222
01:24:15.317 --> 01:24:16.650
Ha!

1223
01:24:16.951 --> 01:24:19.286
There's the Christmas spirit
I been looking for.


1224
01:24:19.687 --> 01:24:20.787
Please.

1225
01:24:21.889 --> 01:24:22.889
Look at you.

1226
01:24:23.658 --> 01:24:24.858
All grown up.

1227
01:24:25.793 --> 01:24:27.327
My beautiful baby girl.

1228
01:24:27.962 --> 01:24:30.530
You turned into a full-blown
true blue hero.


1229
01:24:31.699 --> 01:24:32.866
I'm not a hero.

1230
01:24:33.301 --> 01:24:34.568
Neither am I.

1231
01:24:34.570 --> 01:24:37.571
But that's what they call you
when you kill for uncle Sam.


1232
01:24:37.573 --> 01:24:41.041
Oh, don't worry, I didn't kill
anybody that cared about Christmas,


1233
01:24:41.043 --> 01:24:42.809
and that applies
to the people here, too.


1234
01:24:42.811 --> 01:24:46.380
But you... you could be
the real deal.


1235
01:24:46.382 --> 01:24:48.782
A true hero
and not even know it.


1236
01:24:50.485 --> 01:24:51.952
I could never kill anyone.

1237
01:24:54.589 --> 01:24:55.589
We'll see.

1238
01:24:57.392 --> 01:24:59.326
Because you and I
are gonna play a game.


1239
01:25:00.728 --> 01:25:02.968
And then we'll see how far
the apple falls from the tree.


1240
01:25:06.634 --> 01:25:07.734
You like it?

1241
01:25:09.337 --> 01:25:10.837
It's an IED.

1242
01:25:10.839 --> 01:25:16.443
Absolutely amazing what you can buy
at a hardware store these days. Hmm?


1243
01:25:16.445 --> 01:25:17.644
Why are you doing this?

1244
01:25:20.081 --> 01:25:21.081
For your protection.

1245
01:25:23.384 --> 01:25:24.518
From what?

1246
01:25:24.520 --> 01:25:27.354
From people that don't
believe in anything.


1247
01:25:27.655 --> 01:25:29.356
You could do better
than that, Jennifer.


1248
01:25:29.358 --> 01:25:30.924
You gotta fight
for what's right!


1249
01:25:30.926 --> 01:25:32.359
No, you know what
you have to do?


1250
01:25:32.361 --> 01:25:33.994
You've got to kill
for what's right.


1251
01:25:34.462 --> 01:25:35.595
And I know you can.

1252
01:25:36.097 --> 01:25:37.617
You only let the light
to show the way.


1253
01:25:37.965 --> 01:25:39.633
- Me?
- Yeah.


1254
01:25:40.501 --> 01:25:41.501
Because you and I...

1255
01:25:42.337 --> 01:25:43.370
We're the same.

1256
01:25:44.672 --> 01:25:46.006
You and me, kiddo.

1257
01:25:47.675 --> 01:25:49.443
And I got you a brand new mommy.

1258
01:25:50.345 --> 01:25:51.545
You're gonna love her.

1259
01:26:02.124 --> 01:26:03.757
Come on, get some!

1260
01:26:03.759 --> 01:26:04.858
Yummy.

1261
01:26:06.894 --> 01:26:08.962
I'm not gonna love her or you.

1262
01:26:10.565 --> 01:26:11.965
And don't pretend you love me,

1263
01:26:11.967 --> 01:26:14.501
because you would never
kill my friend if you did.


1264
01:26:14.503 --> 01:26:16.136
How dare you!

1265
01:26:16.138 --> 01:26:18.538
Love never dies, Jennifer.

1266
01:26:19.407 --> 01:26:21.942
They're gonna catch you
and they're gonna kill you.


1267
01:26:23.511 --> 01:26:25.779
No. No, baby.

1268
01:26:27.715 --> 01:26:28.715
No, they're not.

1269
01:26:29.384 --> 01:26:30.517
But you know what?

1270
01:26:30.752 --> 01:26:32.519
If you want me dead...

1271
01:26:32.521 --> 01:26:34.688
Here, all you have to do is
do it yourself.


1272
01:26:34.690 --> 01:26:36.590
- What?
- There you go.


1273
01:26:36.592 --> 01:26:37.758
There you go, baby.

1274
01:26:37.760 --> 01:26:39.159
The power's in your hands.

1275
01:26:39.794 --> 01:26:41.561
Just pull the trigger.
Go for it.


1276
01:26:41.563 --> 01:26:43.130
- Pull the trigger.

1277
01:26:44.699 --> 01:26:45.699
I can't kill anyone.

1278
01:26:49.704 --> 01:26:51.104
Oh. Maybe you have to.

1279
01:26:51.106 --> 01:26:53.974
Cause if you don't,
I might pull this trigger.


1280
01:26:54.876 --> 01:26:56.236
And you wanna guess
what that does?


1281
01:26:57.111 --> 01:26:58.578
Hmm?

1282
01:26:58.580 --> 01:27:00.060
Now, be a good girl
and put the gun up


1283
01:27:00.748 --> 01:27:02.549
or I might blow mom away.

1284
01:27:06.521 --> 01:27:07.921
Attagirl.
Raise it up.


1285
01:27:09.023 --> 01:27:11.691
Come on. Come on.

1286
01:27:11.693 --> 01:27:12.759
That's it.

1287
01:27:12.761 --> 01:27:15.695
Come on. Come on.

1288
01:27:17.099 --> 01:27:18.832
That's it. Go!

1289
01:27:18.834 --> 01:27:19.834
Come on!

1290
01:27:21.569 --> 01:27:22.836
Come on baby girl.
That's it.


1291
01:27:22.838 --> 01:27:24.704
Come on. Do it!

1292
01:27:29.777 --> 01:27:33.146
You see?

1293
01:27:34.515 --> 01:27:35.995
You and I are not
all that dissimilar.


1294
01:27:37.218 --> 01:27:38.919
You only lack the motivation.

1295
01:27:40.755 --> 01:27:42.055
Get away from her.

1296
01:27:42.690 --> 01:27:43.757
You're insane!

1297
01:27:45.026 --> 01:27:46.126
Call me dad.

1298
01:27:46.794 --> 01:27:47.928
Hey, look.

1299
01:27:48.596 --> 01:27:50.497
Whoa. Hold it tight.

1300
01:27:50.499 --> 01:27:52.199
Hold it tight.
There we go.


1301
01:27:53.635 --> 01:27:55.602
Or you'll kill all of us.

1302
01:28:02.743 --> 01:28:03.944
Do you love her?

1303
01:28:05.079 --> 01:28:06.079
What?

1304
01:28:09.684 --> 01:28:11.218
It's Christmas, David!

1305
01:28:14.689 --> 01:28:17.958
Do... you... love her?

1306
01:28:18.759 --> 01:28:19.860
Yeah.

1307
01:28:20.595 --> 01:28:21.595
Yeah, I do.

1308
01:28:23.865 --> 01:28:24.931
That's nice, isn't it?

1309
01:28:24.933 --> 01:28:29.102
Every father wants to hear that
his little baby girl is loved.


1310
01:28:30.638 --> 01:28:31.638
They really do.

1311
01:28:33.574 --> 01:28:35.675
You know what the only problem
with it all is?


1312
01:28:37.011 --> 01:28:39.211
He doesn't ever really want
to hear it from another guy.


1313
01:28:41.249 --> 01:28:42.249
Oh, well.

1314
01:28:55.197 --> 01:28:56.830
Don't you fucking move!

1315
01:29:00.536 --> 01:29:03.169
- Where is he?
- Fuck you!


1316
01:29:04.972 --> 01:29:07.641
- Call for backup!
- Sheriff, we don't have time for that.


1317
01:29:07.643 --> 01:29:09.109
We don't have time to wait.

1318
01:29:09.111 --> 01:29:10.744
Call it in!

1319
01:29:10.746 --> 01:29:12.312
We've got one suspect
in custody.


1320
01:29:12.314 --> 01:29:15.215
I need backup and EMR right now
immediately down to Phil's bar.


1321
01:29:18.953 --> 01:29:21.087
We have company, Jennifer.

1322
01:29:23.090 --> 01:29:25.058
Okay, listen, baby.

1323
01:29:25.060 --> 01:29:27.027
I'm gonna make things real
interesting, 'cause time is short.


1324
01:29:27.029 --> 01:29:30.630
In ten seconds, both of those
IED vests are gonna explode.


1325
01:29:30.632 --> 01:29:33.066
But, you can pick
who lives and who dies.


1326
01:29:36.571 --> 01:29:38.572
- Eight seconds.
- I can't.


1327
01:29:38.574 --> 01:29:40.574
Of course you can. If you
do nothing, both will die.


1328
01:29:40.576 --> 01:29:41.775
Where's the sense in that?

1329
01:29:41.777 --> 01:29:43.877
- No!
- Come on.


1330
01:29:45.146 --> 01:29:47.714
Four, three, two...

1331
01:29:52.820 --> 01:29:53.787
You see?

1332
01:29:53.789 --> 01:29:55.255
There you are.

1333
01:29:56.958 --> 01:29:59.192
Yes. You can kill.

1334
01:30:00.928 --> 01:30:02.162
Attagirl.

1335
01:30:02.164 --> 01:30:03.797
You can kill.

1336
01:30:04.932 --> 01:30:06.900
You just need
the right motivation.


1337
01:30:07.268 --> 01:30:09.636
When someone takes something
from you that you love,


1338
01:30:10.938 --> 01:30:12.172
you'll kill to protect it.

1339
01:30:13.341 --> 01:30:15.909
Just. Like. Me.

1340
01:30:22.116 --> 01:30:23.216
You're safe now, Jennifer.

1341
01:30:24.018 --> 01:30:25.018
We got it from here.

1342
01:30:26.954 --> 01:30:29.389
Don't you listen to him.
You're not safe.


1343
01:30:30.057 --> 01:30:32.859
He's just gonna lock me up
and I'll escape


1344
01:30:33.361 --> 01:30:35.662
and then I'll find you...
Both of you!


1345
01:30:37.665 --> 01:30:39.299
So what's my baby girl gonna do?

1346
01:30:44.005 --> 01:30:45.905
Close your eyes.

1347
01:30:45.907 --> 01:30:46.973
No!

1348
01:30:55.282 --> 01:30:56.282
It was a stun grenade.

1349
01:30:57.985 --> 01:30:58.985
You're safe. You're safe.

1350
01:31:00.655 --> 01:31:01.655
He's gone.

1351
01:31:13.968 --> 01:31:16.970
<i>The horrific Christmas killings that
rocked the sleepy town of Woodridge</i>


1352
01:31:17.204 --> 01:31:19.706
came to a terrifying
conclusion this morning,


1353
01:31:20.007 --> 01:31:23.176
with an early hours massacre
at an event in Phil's bar,


1354
01:31:23.178 --> 01:31:26.012
<i>the main drinking establishment
in this now infamous town.</i>


1355
01:31:26.747 --> 01:31:29.983
A series of bizarre murders
and vandalism that crescendoed


1356
01:31:29.985 --> 01:31:33.153
over the last 12 days finally
climaxed with a deadly assault


1357
01:31:33.155 --> 01:31:35.288
on the patrons of a music event.

1358
01:31:36.223 --> 01:31:38.445
Details are still
emerging, but we do know


1359
01:31:38.457 --> 01:31:40.794
that so many people were
killed and injured,


1360
01:31:40.796 --> 01:31:44.464
that extra emergency personnel had to be
brought in from neighboring counties,


1361
01:31:44.466 --> 01:31:48.702
<i>with victims still being taken
to hospital well into daylight.</i>


1362
01:31:49.370 --> 01:31:52.372
One suspect is believed to be in
police custody while the other,


1363
01:31:52.773 --> 01:31:55.308
army veteran, Nick Conway,
is still at large.


1364
01:31:55.910 --> 01:31:58.912
Local police chief, sheriff
Mitchell, issued a warning


1365
01:31:58.914 --> 01:32:00.747
<i>to the public not
to approach Conway,</i>


1366
01:32:00.749 --> 01:32:02.949
<i>but to instead call 911
immediately,</i>


1367
01:32:03.184 --> 01:32:05.218
<i>as he's still considered
extremely dangerous.</i>


1368
01:32:05.920 --> 01:32:08.722
It's doubtful that the residents
of this small town


1369
01:32:08.724 --> 01:32:10.457
will be able
to forget what happened


1370
01:32:11.092 --> 01:32:13.159
over these terrifying

1371
01:32:29.944 --> 01:32:31.878
How about you unlock this door?

1372
01:32:33.214 --> 01:32:36.316
And we can have the most
wonderful time of the year.


1373
01:32:38.419 --> 01:32:40.153
You're never getting
out of this jail cell.


1374
01:32:41.255 --> 01:32:42.355
Hmm.

1375
01:32:43.991 --> 01:32:46.359
You're playing hard to get.

1376
01:32:48.863 --> 01:32:51.364
You like the anticipation...

1377
01:32:52.533 --> 01:32:55.201
Before you get the presents.

1378
01:32:55.903 --> 01:32:56.903
Right?

1379
01:33:06.814 --> 01:33:08.848
How long do you think
it's gonna be


1380
01:33:09.984 --> 01:33:12.385
before daddy comes to get me?

1381
01:33:13.420 --> 01:33:15.555
- Never.
- Hmm.


1382
01:33:15.557 --> 01:33:18.424
See, we hit him, and he's hurt.

1383
01:33:19.426 --> 01:33:22.462
And sooner or later,
he's gotta go get help


1384
01:33:22.464 --> 01:33:24.430
and when he does
he's gonna slip up.


1385
01:33:25.432 --> 01:33:27.200
And I'm gonna be there
to nail him.


1386
01:33:29.837 --> 01:33:31.471
The only place that you two are
going...


1387
01:33:32.973 --> 01:33:33.973
Is to the chair.

1388
01:33:38.546 --> 01:33:40.346
You're gonna pay
for everything you did.


1389
01:33:56.163 --> 01:33:57.897
You'd better watch out.
