2
00:06:13.171 --> 00:06:14.796
Alert the queen.

3
00:06:34.713 --> 00:06:35.796
Hyah!

4
00:09:05.338 --> 00:09:08.338
Bruce Vayne.

5
00:09:08.421 --> 00:09:10.171
Bruce Wayne.

6
00:09:28.004 --> 00:09:29.588
Talk.

7
00:09:30.713 --> 00:09:32.463
I believe there is a stranger.

8
00:09:32.546 --> 00:09:35.213
Comes to this village
from the sea.


9
00:09:35.296 --> 00:09:38.296
He comes in the winter
when the people are hungry.


10
00:09:38.379 --> 00:09:40.629
He brings fish.

11
00:09:40.713 --> 00:09:42.421
He comes on the king tide.

12
00:09:42.504 --> 00:09:43.713
That was last night.

13
00:09:50.255 --> 00:09:52.714
You have eyes, so see.

14
00:09:52.797 --> 00:09:54.505
Icebergs in the harbor.

15
00:09:54.589 --> 00:09:57.672
It's four months since
the last ship got through.


16
00:09:57.755 --> 00:10:02.089
Well, this stranger
doesn't come by ship.


17
00:10:08.714 --> 00:10:12.672
There are enemies
coming from far away.


18
00:10:13.839 --> 00:10:15.505
I need warriors.

19
00:10:15.589 --> 00:10:19.130
This stranger,
others like him.


20
00:10:19.214 --> 00:10:23.589
I'm building an alliance
to defend ourselves.


21
00:10:23.672 --> 00:10:26.880
It's very important
that I see this man.


22
00:10:27.880 --> 00:10:30.255
If this stranger exists,

23
00:10:30.339 --> 00:10:32.547
he'll give him your message.

24
00:10:32.630 --> 00:10:33.839
$5,000 American.

25
00:10:33.922 --> 00:10:35.672
Look, I'll give you $25,000

26
00:10:35.755 --> 00:10:38.839
to talk to this man
right now, outside.


27
00:10:50.589 --> 00:10:55.839
How dare this dog
speak to us like children.


28
00:10:55.922 --> 00:10:59.672
Ooh, magical man from the sea.

29
00:10:59.755 --> 00:11:02.755
We are poor, not stupid.

30
00:11:02.839 --> 00:11:04.630
Get out.

31
00:11:05.630 --> 00:11:07.214
I'm sorry.

32
00:11:07.297 --> 00:11:09.005
Can't do that.

33
00:11:09.089 --> 00:11:11.380
I'll leave after we've spoken.

34
00:11:16.005 --> 00:11:17.547
He said, "Get out."

35
00:11:36.464 --> 00:11:38.297
Arthur Curry.

36
00:11:38.380 --> 00:11:41.380
Also known as
Protector of the Oceans.


37
00:11:41.964 --> 00:11:43.714
The Aquaman.

38
00:11:49.172 --> 00:11:50.922
So, let me
get this straight.


39
00:11:51.005 --> 00:11:54.714
You do it dressed like a bat?
Like an actual bat?


40
00:11:54.797 --> 00:11:56.589
Worked for 20 years in Gotham.

41
00:11:56.672 --> 00:11:58.505
Oh, that shithole.

42
00:11:58.589 --> 00:12:00.464
When the fight comes,
we'll need you.


43
00:12:00.547 --> 00:12:03.047
- Don't count on it, Batman.
- Why not?


44
00:12:03.130 --> 00:12:05.089
'Cause I don't like you coming
here, digging into my business


45
00:12:05.172 --> 00:12:07.922
and getting into my life.
I want to be left alone.


46
00:12:08.005 --> 00:12:09.589
Is that why you do this?

47
00:12:09.672 --> 00:12:11.339
Why you help these people out
here in the middle of nowhere?


48
00:12:11.422 --> 00:12:12.672
I've read the stories.

49
00:12:12.755 --> 00:12:15.005
Your good deeds
you think no one sees.


50
00:12:15.089 --> 00:12:16.547
You'll join us.

51
00:12:16.630 --> 00:12:18.464
"Strong man
is strongest alone."


52
00:12:18.547 --> 00:12:20.089
You ever heard that?

53
00:12:20.172 --> 00:12:21.714
You ever hear
of Superman?


54
00:12:21.797 --> 00:12:23.505
He died fighting next to me.

55
00:12:24.755 --> 00:12:26.089
My point exactly.

56
00:12:26.172 --> 00:12:28.505
He believed
we were stronger together.


57
00:12:28.589 --> 00:12:30.214
We owe it to him.

58
00:12:30.297 --> 00:12:32.755
I don't owe anyone anything.

59
00:12:40.255 --> 00:12:42.839
Dressed like a bat.

60
00:12:42.922 --> 00:12:45.005
You're out of your mind,
Bruce Wayne.


61
00:14:13.423 --> 00:14:14.756
Move over, Dusty.

62
00:15:10.381 --> 00:15:13.506
My God, Master Wayne,
but this is cold.


63
00:15:13.590 --> 00:15:18.048
Maybe we can catch
the next king tide in Jamaica?


64
00:15:18.131 --> 00:15:20.590
Might be
a metahuman or two in Fiji.


65
00:15:20.673 --> 00:15:22.423
Costa Rica's nice.

66
00:15:22.506 --> 00:15:24.048
I found him.

67
00:15:26.840 --> 00:15:29.048
He said no.

68
00:15:29.131 --> 00:15:31.465
So the draft stands
at naught for two?


69
00:15:33.631 --> 00:15:36.506
Maybe a man who broods
in a cave for a living


70
00:15:36.590 --> 00:15:40.298
isn't cut out to be
a recruiter. Hmm?


71
00:15:59.840 --> 00:16:01.756
That's $10, please.

72
00:16:39.798 --> 00:16:40.881
Good morning, Miss Lane.

73
00:16:40.965 --> 00:16:42.423
Jerry, hi.

74
00:16:43.215 --> 00:16:45.048
Wow.

75
00:16:45.131 --> 00:16:46.590
You don't miss a day, do you?

76
00:16:47.923 --> 00:16:49.965
Like it here.

77
00:18:35.257 --> 00:18:36.424
Excuse me.

78
00:18:37.716 --> 00:18:39.132
Move!

79
00:18:49.924 --> 00:18:51.507
Move it! Move it!

80
00:18:57.507 --> 00:19:00.257
- No, mate, don't shoot!
- Move, move!


81
00:19:00.341 --> 00:19:02.049
Get the fuck
over there!


82
00:19:03.966 --> 00:19:05.591
Move! All of ya!

83
00:19:15.966 --> 00:19:18.132
Line them up
along the wall.


84
00:19:18.216 --> 00:19:20.841
Keep them quiet.

85
00:19:20.924 --> 00:19:23.466
- Keep quiet!
- Shut up! Shut up!


86
00:19:23.549 --> 00:19:25.049
Shut them up too!

87
00:19:27.882 --> 00:19:30.549
We'll be making
a statement shortly.


88
00:19:30.632 --> 00:19:32.507
Until then,
if I see any movement,


89
00:19:32.591 --> 00:19:34.841
you'll have a lot of dead kids
on your hands.


90
00:19:49.757 --> 00:19:51.299
Should I take him?

91
00:19:51.382 --> 00:19:53.174
Hold your fire.

92
00:19:54.591 --> 00:19:55.757
They've got kids in there.

93
00:19:57.507 --> 00:19:59.341
Yeah,
he's not bluffing, chief.


94
00:19:59.424 --> 00:20:01.841
St. Brigid's had
a school trip today.


95
00:20:25.882 --> 00:20:27.632
Quiet! Shut up!

96
00:20:32.674 --> 00:20:35.091
Down with the modern world.

97
00:20:35.174 --> 00:20:36.841
Back to the Dark Ages.

98
00:20:42.174 --> 00:20:43.299
Quiet!

99
00:20:45.132 --> 00:20:47.966
I said
shut your fucking mouth.


100
00:21:00.966 --> 00:21:03.674
Who are you?

101
00:21:03.757 --> 00:21:06.841
The Lasso of Hestia compels
you to reveal the truth.


102
00:21:07.507 --> 00:21:09.424
Now, who are you?

103
00:21:09.507 --> 00:21:12.591
We're a small group
of reactionary terrorists


104
00:21:12.674 --> 00:21:14.382
who wanna turn back
the clock in Europe


105
00:21:14.466 --> 00:21:16.924
- a thousand years.
- Boring. Why the hostages?


106
00:21:17.007 --> 00:21:18.549
We have no demands.

107
00:21:18.632 --> 00:21:20.424
We're just stalling the police
while we do it.


108
00:21:20.507 --> 00:21:21.966
While you do what?

109
00:21:22.049 --> 00:21:26.174
You're too late.
The countdown's already begun.


110
00:21:26.257 --> 00:21:29.800
In a few minutes,
four city blocks...


111
00:21:31.092 --> 00:21:34.050
...while the world watches.

112
00:23:13.842 --> 00:23:14.925
No!

113
00:23:15.008 --> 00:23:16.967
Like lambs
to the slaughter.


114
00:24:05.425 --> 00:24:07.675
I don't believe it.

115
00:24:07.758 --> 00:24:08.883
Believe it.

116
00:24:44.300 --> 00:24:47.342
Is everyone all right?
Are you okay?


117
00:24:47.425 --> 00:24:49.550
Good. It's okay.

118
00:24:49.633 --> 00:24:51.925
It's okay. It's over.
You can stand up.


119
00:24:52.008 --> 00:24:53.300
It's all good.

120
00:24:53.383 --> 00:24:55.300
It's over now.
Are you okay?


121
00:24:55.383 --> 00:24:57.675
You okay? Good.

122
00:25:03.217 --> 00:25:04.633
Are you okay, princess?

123
00:25:07.967 --> 00:25:09.883
Can I be like you someday?

124
00:25:11.842 --> 00:25:14.675
You can be anything
you want to be.


125
00:25:16.425 --> 00:25:18.925
Come on. Let's go.

126
00:26:01.634 --> 00:26:02.926
Any changes today?

127
00:26:03.009 --> 00:26:04.593
No, my Queen.

128
00:26:06.051 --> 00:26:08.134
The Mother Box has awoken,

129
00:26:08.218 --> 00:26:11.134
yet nothing has happened.

130
00:26:11.218 --> 00:26:13.426
It has slept
for thousands of years


131
00:26:13.509 --> 00:26:15.551
since the First Age.

132
00:26:15.634 --> 00:26:17.093
Why did it wake at all?

133
00:26:24.759 --> 00:26:26.759
This is the first time
it's gone quiet


134
00:26:26.843 --> 00:26:28.093
since the crack appeared.

135
00:26:28.176 --> 00:26:31.009
Maybe it's going
back to sleep.


136
00:26:35.009 --> 00:26:36.843
Evil does not sleep.

137
00:26:37.676 --> 00:26:39.634
It waits.

138
00:26:41.009 --> 00:26:43.093
Something is coming.

139
00:26:48.218 --> 00:26:49.676
Prepare for battle!

140
00:27:15.551 --> 00:27:17.968
Amazons,
on your marks!


141
00:27:18.051 --> 00:27:19.426
Ready!

142
00:27:44.551 --> 00:27:46.634
Defenders.

143
00:27:48.051 --> 00:27:52.884
They have failed

144
00:27:52.968 --> 00:27:54.551
They always fail.

145
00:27:56.259 --> 00:28:01.134
I've come to enlighten you
to the great darkness.


146
00:28:01.218 --> 00:28:04.259
I will bathe in your fear.

147
00:28:05.634 --> 00:28:08.259
Daughters of Themyscira,

148
00:28:09.426 --> 00:28:11.093
show him your fear!

149
00:28:11.176 --> 00:28:13.718
We have no fear!

150
00:28:32.884 --> 00:28:34.634
Gather the legions!

151
00:28:35.468 --> 00:28:36.676
Go with her!

152
00:28:36.759 --> 00:28:38.176
You must seal the cage!

153
00:28:38.259 --> 00:28:40.593
- Go!
- Phillipus!


154
00:29:07.218 --> 00:29:08.426
No!

155
00:29:20.969 --> 00:29:22.135
Behind you!

156
00:29:26.010 --> 00:29:27.427
Ahhh!

157
00:29:29.469 --> 00:29:30.719
Epione.

158
00:29:32.510 --> 00:29:34.677
Honor us. It's right.

159
00:29:37.594 --> 00:29:38.969
Seal it.

160
00:29:44.135 --> 00:29:46.677
Ready the hammers!

161
00:29:59.010 --> 00:30:01.177
Seal it now!

162
00:31:35.469 --> 00:31:37.094
Guard it with your life.

163
00:31:37.177 --> 00:31:39.052
- Yes, my Queen.
- Keep it moving.


164
00:31:39.135 --> 00:31:40.677
Hyah! Hyah!

165
00:33:03.802 --> 00:33:05.803
Hyah!

166
00:34:25.178 --> 00:34:26.845
Got it! Go!

167
00:34:27.928 --> 00:34:29.220
Hyah!

168
00:34:49.511 --> 00:34:53.928
Oh, noble Queen.
Why do you fight?


169
00:34:56.845 --> 00:34:58.636
You can't save her.

170
00:34:58.720 --> 00:35:01.386
You can't save any of them.

171
00:35:04.720 --> 00:35:08.761
The great darkness begins.

172
00:35:08.845 --> 00:35:10.720
Amazons!

173
00:35:20.845 --> 00:35:23.636
Yes, we will find the others.

174
00:35:25.345 --> 00:35:28.011
Draw!

175
00:35:30.178 --> 00:35:31.553
Loose!

176
00:36:29.261 --> 00:36:31.345
He's gone back
to his universe.


177
00:36:31.428 --> 00:36:32.553
No.

178
00:36:34.928 --> 00:36:37.386
He's gone to the lands of men

179
00:36:37.470 --> 00:36:40.678
to find the other two boxes.

180
00:36:40.761 --> 00:36:43.886
We have to light
the ancient warning fire.


181
00:36:43.970 --> 00:36:47.553
The fire has not burned
for 5,000 years.


182
00:36:47.636 --> 00:36:49.345
Men won't know what it means.

183
00:36:50.095 --> 00:36:51.636
Men won't.

184
00:36:53.303 --> 00:36:54.803
She will.

185
00:37:25.387 --> 00:37:28.096
It's toxic.

186
00:37:28.179 --> 00:37:30.012
That's good.

187
00:37:50.887 --> 00:37:52.012
Go!

188
00:37:52.096 --> 00:37:54.262
Follow the scent
of the Mother Boxes.


189
00:37:54.346 --> 00:37:55.846
Find the missing two.

190
00:37:55.929 --> 00:37:59.929
Once they are found,
The Unity will be formed.


191
00:38:00.012 --> 00:38:03.012
This world
will join the others.


192
00:38:04.762 --> 00:38:06.804
He will be pleased.

193
00:38:06.887 --> 00:38:10.012
He will see my worth again.

194
00:38:12.554 --> 00:38:14.304
Hey.

195
00:38:14.387 --> 00:38:17.137
Anything on that kid
from the liquor store?


196
00:38:17.221 --> 00:38:18.804
Possibly.

197
00:38:19.471 --> 00:38:21.637
"Possibly."

198
00:38:21.721 --> 00:38:24.304
If I had a dollar
for every "possibly."


199
00:38:24.387 --> 00:38:27.304
Yeah, it would make you
even more insufferable.


200
00:38:30.012 --> 00:38:32.887
Facial scan might have
got a hit on him,


201
00:38:32.971 --> 00:38:35.262
our disappearing man.

202
00:38:35.346 --> 00:38:40.179
One Mr. Barry Allen
from Central City.


203
00:38:40.262 --> 00:38:41.637
Might be
another false positive,


204
00:38:41.721 --> 00:38:43.179
you'll have to give me
a little time


205
00:38:43.262 --> 00:38:45.762
- to confirm.
- We don't have any more time.


206
00:38:47.346 --> 00:38:49.012
Master Wayne,

207
00:38:49.096 --> 00:38:51.596
you've been working
as if there's no tomorrow


208
00:38:51.679 --> 00:38:52.804
to build this team

209
00:38:52.887 --> 00:38:54.679
of people you can't even find.

210
00:38:54.762 --> 00:38:57.137
I found one.
I found two, including Diana.


211
00:38:57.221 --> 00:38:59.221
Just because Lex Luthor says

212
00:38:59.304 --> 00:39:01.179
the planet's
in danger of attack?


213
00:39:01.262 --> 00:39:03.429
This has nothing
to do with Lex Luthor.


214
00:39:03.512 --> 00:39:04.846
It has to do with him.

215
00:39:04.929 --> 00:39:09.012
I made a promise to him
on his grave.


216
00:39:09.096 --> 00:39:12.262
I spent a lot of time
trying to divide us.


217
00:39:12.346 --> 00:39:15.846
I need to bring us together
and make this right.


218
00:39:15.929 --> 00:39:18.679
Well, it's been some time
since Luthor's warning.


219
00:39:18.762 --> 00:39:23.096
No attacks.
No barbarians at the gate.


220
00:39:23.179 --> 00:39:26.679
Maybe these barbarians
don't use a gate.


221
00:39:26.762 --> 00:39:28.554
Maybe they're already here.

222
00:39:32.346 --> 00:39:34.304
Keep looking.
What else do you have?


223
00:40:13.179 --> 00:40:14.846
Lab's all yours, Howard.

224
00:40:14.929 --> 00:40:16.554
11:30.

225
00:40:16.637 --> 00:40:18.096
Early night for you, Silas.

226
00:40:18.179 --> 00:40:20.804
Yes, early night.

227
00:40:20.887 --> 00:40:22.179
Tell your family I said hello.

228
00:40:57.388 --> 00:40:59.138
What the...

229
00:41:03.013 --> 00:41:04.138
Jesus.

230
00:42:17.305 --> 00:42:20.097
The Arrow of Artemis.

231
00:42:20.180 --> 00:42:22.888
It will reach
the lands of men.


232
00:42:32.472 --> 00:42:33.847
Sky torch,

233
00:42:33.930 --> 00:42:35.555
hero beacon,

234
00:42:35.638 --> 00:42:37.305
scatter the darkness.

235
00:42:37.388 --> 00:42:40.888
Burn as you burned
in days before.


236
00:42:42.180 --> 00:42:46.138
Show her the darkness before
the daylight of history.


237
00:42:46.222 --> 00:42:50.013
Warn my daughter
that war has come


238
00:42:51.305 --> 00:42:53.097
and protect her.

239
00:43:17.680 --> 00:43:20.138
Return to me, Diana.

240
00:43:58.430 --> 00:44:01.472
<i>What did you do
this weekend, Diana?</i>


241
00:44:01.555 --> 00:44:03.805
Nothing very interesting.

242
00:44:03.888 --> 00:44:06.430
That's all you ever tell us.

243
00:44:06.513 --> 00:44:10.013
What can I do?
I'm not that exciting.


244
00:44:10.097 --> 00:44:14.305
You might as well disappear
when you walk out of here.


245
00:44:18.597 --> 00:44:19.638
Again?

246
00:44:19.722 --> 00:44:21.930
- What is it?
- Now what?


247
00:44:22.013 --> 00:44:25.222
Budget cuts, tomb raiders.

248
00:44:25.305 --> 00:44:27.972
Now add to the list "arson."

249
00:44:29.597 --> 00:44:31.347
<i>Yes, good morning</i>

250
00:44:31.430 --> 00:44:33.055
<i>From the isle of Crete.</i>

251
00:44:33.138 --> 00:44:34.555
<i>As you can see behind me,</i>

252
00:44:34.638 --> 00:44:37.013
<i>an enormous bonfire
is burning.</i>


253
00:44:37.097 --> 00:44:39.388
<i>This fire has been burning
through the night.</i>


254
00:44:39.472 --> 00:44:40.847
<i>We're now into the morning</i>

255
00:44:40.930 --> 00:44:43.222
<i>and we are
at least five miles away.</i>


256
00:44:43.305 --> 00:44:46.681
<i>And we can still
see it burning as we speak.</i>


257
00:44:46.764 --> 00:44:50.056
<i>This has baffled locals and
government authorities alike</i>


258
00:44:50.139 --> 00:44:51.973
<i>here at this historical site</i>

259
00:44:52.056 --> 00:44:54.556
<i>of the so-called shrine
of the Amazons.</i>


260
00:44:54.639 --> 00:44:56.556
<i>Now, locals and government
officials are baffled as to</i>


261
00:44:56.639 --> 00:44:58.931
- <i>what may have caused this.</i>
- Invasion.


262
00:45:08.014 --> 00:45:09.014
Ryan.

263
00:45:09.098 --> 00:45:10.514
- Hiya, Doc.
- Is the...


264
00:45:10.598 --> 00:45:12.723
No damage
to the electron-laser.


265
00:45:12.806 --> 00:45:14.889
- Uh, Dr. Silas Stone?
- Yeah.


266
00:45:14.973 --> 00:45:16.848
- Ryan Choi?
- That's us.


267
00:45:16.931 --> 00:45:19.306
Um, who did this?
Did they steal anything?


268
00:45:19.389 --> 00:45:20.973
They took
whatever was in here.


269
00:45:21.056 --> 00:45:24.931
That? Oh, that wasn't stolen.
Was it, Dr. Stone?


270
00:45:25.014 --> 00:45:27.806
No. That was misplaced
a while ago.


271
00:45:27.889 --> 00:45:31.806
Object 6-1-9-8-2. Department
of Defense Archives.


272
00:45:31.889 --> 00:45:34.181
- Mmm-hmm.
- What was it?


273
00:45:34.264 --> 00:45:35.223
I don't know.

274
00:45:35.306 --> 00:45:36.681
You don't know?

275
00:45:36.764 --> 00:45:38.723
I don't know, which was why
I was studying it.


276
00:45:38.806 --> 00:45:40.556
What's your rank, Doctor?

277
00:45:40.639 --> 00:45:42.806
Ryan, would you, uh,
do the honors?


278
00:45:42.889 --> 00:45:44.473
- Sure. Okay.
- Thanks.


279
00:45:44.556 --> 00:45:47.056
Civilian. STARLABS
is a private contractor.


280
00:45:47.139 --> 00:45:48.306
We work for the DoD.

281
00:45:48.389 --> 00:45:51.348
We advise them
on xeno-science.


282
00:45:51.431 --> 00:45:53.014
"Xeno-science"?

283
00:45:53.098 --> 00:45:55.056
Alien technology.

284
00:46:02.056 --> 00:46:04.223
For example,

285
00:46:04.306 --> 00:46:05.973
the Superman ship.

286
00:46:14.139 --> 00:46:15.431
Eight people

287
00:46:15.514 --> 00:46:17.306
never signed out
of the lab last night, Doctor.


288
00:46:17.389 --> 00:46:18.598
Cleaning staff, guards,

289
00:46:18.681 --> 00:46:20.764
a few of
your research scientists.


290
00:46:20.848 --> 00:46:21.973
They were abducted.

291
00:46:23.223 --> 00:46:24.306
Are you sure?

292
00:46:24.389 --> 00:46:26.848
Witness saw it all.
He escaped.


293
00:46:26.931 --> 00:46:30.348
He's here in quarantine now,
working on an ID sketch.


294
00:46:33.098 --> 00:46:37.723
Any idea who
or what that might be?


295
00:46:57.639 --> 00:46:59.848
The box
isn't safe here.


296
00:47:02.264 --> 00:47:03.723
Victor,

297
00:47:03.806 --> 00:47:06.098
they came looking for it
at the lab.


298
00:47:06.181 --> 00:47:10.889
People were taken by some kind
of monster or something.


299
00:47:13.431 --> 00:47:15.556
You know a lot about monsters,

300
00:47:16.098 --> 00:47:17.681
don't you?

301
00:47:23.889 --> 00:47:26.681
Especially how to make 'em.

302
00:50:26.599 --> 00:50:30.390
Mayday! Mayday, mayday!

303
00:50:31.974 --> 00:50:35.307
My hull is breached.
I'm going down.


304
00:50:40.515 --> 00:50:42.515
Mayday!

305
00:50:42.599 --> 00:50:44.807
Is there anybody out there?

306
00:50:50.140 --> 00:50:51.265
Ahh!

307
00:51:25.057 --> 00:51:26.390
Whiskey.

308
00:51:35.349 --> 00:51:38.140
Tell him to respect
the storm next time.


309
00:51:47.224 --> 00:51:48.349
It's on him.

310
00:54:16.391 --> 00:54:18.475
King who would be man.

311
00:54:18.558 --> 00:54:21.975
Son of a human father
and Queen of the Seas.


312
00:54:22.725 --> 00:54:24.433
All the time I've wasted

313
00:54:24.516 --> 00:54:27.850
trying to keep the promise
I made to your mother.


314
00:54:29.725 --> 00:54:31.141
Are you finished,
old man?


315
00:54:31.225 --> 00:54:33.683
You never sleep
in the same place twice,


316
00:54:33.766 --> 00:54:36.683
yet you keep coming back here.

317
00:54:38.516 --> 00:54:40.558
I like it. It's quiet.

318
00:54:40.641 --> 00:54:42.433
It's your inheritance.

319
00:54:42.516 --> 00:54:44.850
You're the rightful king
of Atlantis.


320
00:54:45.850 --> 00:54:47.100
Our people suffer.

321
00:54:47.183 --> 00:54:49.100
Your people.

322
00:54:49.183 --> 00:54:52.850
A brutal, petty,
superstitious race.


323
00:54:52.933 --> 00:54:55.141
Is the surface any different?

324
00:54:55.225 --> 00:54:57.516
Nobody calls me
King of the Surface.


325
00:54:58.433 --> 00:55:00.558
What do you want, Vulko?

326
00:55:00.641 --> 00:55:02.058
Guards near
the stronghold


327
00:55:02.141 --> 00:55:03.683
have been disappearing.

328
00:55:03.766 --> 00:55:05.266
Snatchers from above.

329
00:55:05.350 --> 00:55:06.558
Talk to King Orm.

330
00:55:06.641 --> 00:55:08.141
- Your brother?
- Half-brother.


331
00:55:08.225 --> 00:55:11.683
He's trying to fan the flames
of war with the surface.


332
00:55:11.766 --> 00:55:14.350
He lies.

333
00:55:14.433 --> 00:55:16.683
The snatchers have come
from the dark place.


334
00:55:16.766 --> 00:55:19.183
They're looking for it.

335
00:55:19.266 --> 00:55:23.558
The Mother Box
our people guard is not safe.


336
00:55:23.641 --> 00:55:26.183
Go to the stronghold
of Atlantis.


337
00:55:26.266 --> 00:55:27.850
Protect the box.

338
00:55:28.725 --> 00:55:30.058
The time has come.

339
00:55:32.058 --> 00:55:34.183
Take up your mother's trident.

340
00:55:45.100 --> 00:55:49.100
You can't turn your back
on the world forever, Arthur.


341
00:55:49.891 --> 00:55:52.933
Above or below.

342
00:56:22.058 --> 00:56:23.725
DeSaad.

343
00:56:23.809 --> 00:56:27.892
DeSaad! I call to thee.

344
00:56:36.684 --> 00:56:41.934
Steppenwolf,
have you begun the conquest?


345
00:56:42.017 --> 00:56:45.142
This world is divided.

346
00:56:45.226 --> 00:56:46.767
They are a primitive species.

347
00:56:46.851 --> 00:56:49.351
Unevolved and at war
with one another.


348
00:56:49.434 --> 00:56:52.267
Too separate to be one.

349
00:56:52.351 --> 00:56:54.767
Their free will
must be ripped from them,


350
00:56:54.851 --> 00:56:56.684
like the other worlds.

351
00:56:56.767 --> 00:57:01.101
Given absolution
in one glorious belief,


352
00:57:01.184 --> 00:57:03.059
to serve him.

353
00:57:03.726 --> 00:57:06.101
The Mother Boxes?

354
00:57:06.184 --> 00:57:09.101
I have found one of the three.

355
00:57:09.184 --> 00:57:11.767
The one that woke
and called to me.


356
00:57:11.851 --> 00:57:13.392
The other two still sleep,

357
00:57:13.476 --> 00:57:17.559
but the parademons
feel their presence.


358
00:57:17.642 --> 00:57:19.059
They fly,

359
00:57:19.142 --> 00:57:22.726
they search, they take
prisoners who carry the scent,


360
00:57:22.809 --> 00:57:27.976
while I build a stronghold
in the name of his glory.


361
00:57:28.476 --> 00:57:30.434
Yes.

362
00:57:31.351 --> 00:57:35.267
Mighty Steppenwolf,

363
00:57:35.351 --> 00:57:40.059
who might have sat here
by the side of the great one.


364
00:57:41.809 --> 00:57:46.559
But undone by his self-pride.

365
00:57:47.684 --> 00:57:49.142
DeSaad...

366
00:57:50.059 --> 00:57:53.101
I fall before you.

367
00:57:53.184 --> 00:57:55.101
Let me make a plea to him

368
00:57:55.184 --> 00:57:57.059
that I may come home

369
00:57:57.142 --> 00:58:00.142
after I take this world
in his name.


370
00:58:00.226 --> 00:58:02.767
You betrayed him.

371
00:58:04.059 --> 00:58:05.642
Your own family.

372
00:58:05.726 --> 00:58:07.851
I saw my mistake.

373
00:58:07.934 --> 00:58:10.601
I slaughtered those
who sought his throne.


374
00:58:10.684 --> 00:58:16.059
You still owe the great one

375
00:58:17.017 --> 00:58:19.226
He will hear your plea

376
00:58:19.309 --> 00:58:21.684
when you pay your debt.

377
00:58:24.434 --> 00:58:27.726
The Mother Boxes
will be found and united.


378
00:58:28.517 --> 00:58:30.684
No protectors here.

379
00:58:30.767 --> 00:58:34.184
No Lanterns, no Kryptonian.

380
00:58:34.267 --> 00:58:38.184
This world will fall,
like all the others.


381
00:58:39.101 --> 00:58:40.976
For Darkseid.

382
00:58:44.059 --> 00:58:46.392
For Darkseid.

383
00:59:07.476 --> 00:59:09.434
You know,
I paid millions of dollars


384
00:59:09.517 --> 00:59:11.101
for this building's security.

385
00:59:11.184 --> 00:59:12.892
You got
your money's worth.


386
00:59:12.976 --> 00:59:15.601
Took me almost a minute
to disable it.


387
00:59:17.059 --> 00:59:18.434
Hi there.

388
00:59:19.976 --> 00:59:21.142
A new toy?

389
00:59:21.892 --> 00:59:24.184
Prototype troop carrier.

390
00:59:25.726 --> 00:59:27.226
I once knew a man

391
00:59:27.309 --> 00:59:29.892
who would have loved
to fly it.


392
00:59:29.976 --> 00:59:31.809
The best minds
at Wayne Aerospace


393
00:59:31.892 --> 00:59:33.142
couldn't make it fly.

394
00:59:34.101 --> 00:59:35.767
But you can?

395
00:59:35.851 --> 00:59:37.476
I have no choice.

396
00:59:37.559 --> 00:59:40.392
I need more range
and I need more cargo.


397
00:59:40.476 --> 00:59:42.517
I think
there's an attack coming.


398
00:59:42.601 --> 00:59:44.476
Not coming, Bruce.

399
00:59:45.142 --> 00:59:47.809
It's already here.

400
00:59:47.892 --> 00:59:49.684
From what I've learned,

401
00:59:49.767 --> 00:59:52.517
they are things
from another universe.


402
00:59:52.601 --> 00:59:55.059
They serve a dark power.

403
00:59:55.142 --> 00:59:56.892
An old power.

404
00:59:56.976 --> 00:59:58.309
What do they want?

405
00:59:58.392 --> 01:00:02.517
To invade.
To conquer.


406
01:00:02.601 --> 01:00:07.059
They came here once before,
long ago.


407
01:00:11.976 --> 01:00:14.476
<i>A great armada
appeared in the sky,</i>


408
01:00:14.559 --> 01:00:17.143
<i>laying waste
to all who opposed it.</i>


409
01:00:17.227 --> 01:00:21.435
<i>The leader of the invaders
was a being called Darkseid.</i>


410
01:00:21.518 --> 01:00:26.560
<i>A name cursed and feared
in every universe.</i>


411
01:00:26.643 --> 01:00:30.768
<i>Darkseid was met in battle
by Earth's defenders.</i>


412
01:00:30.852 --> 01:00:33.685
<i>The old gods, men...</i>

413
01:00:33.768 --> 01:00:37.185
<i>Atlanteans before
their descent into the sea...</i>


414
01:00:39.227 --> 01:00:43.393
<i>Amazons before their betrayal
and enslavement</i>


415
01:00:43.477 --> 01:00:45.893
<i>and guardians from the stars.</i>

416
01:00:45.977 --> 01:00:47.977
<i>Their histories
had taught them</i>


417
01:00:48.060 --> 01:00:49.685
<i>not to trust each other,</i>

418
01:00:49.768 --> 01:00:52.102
<i>not to hope for an alliance.</i>

419
01:00:52.185 --> 01:00:54.310
<i>To fight apart.</i>

420
01:01:43.060 --> 01:01:45.977
<i>As Darkseid
waged war on Earth,</i>


421
01:01:46.060 --> 01:01:47.435
<i>he found a secret there.</i>

422
01:01:47.518 --> 01:01:51.477
<i>A power hidden
in the infinity of space.</i>


423
01:01:51.560 --> 01:01:53.060
<i>He called forth mystics</i>

424
01:01:53.143 --> 01:01:56.477
<i>who worshipped and controlled
three objects...</i>


425
01:01:56.560 --> 01:01:57.893
<i>the Mother Boxes.</i>

426
01:01:57.977 --> 01:01:59.477
Wait, wait, wait.

427
01:01:59.560 --> 01:02:00.560
"Mother Boxes"?

428
01:02:00.643 --> 01:02:03.727
Indestructible
living machines,


429
01:02:03.810 --> 01:02:06.602
<i>made from a science
so advanced,</i>


430
01:02:06.685 --> 01:02:08.768
<i>it looks like sorcery.</i>

431
01:02:08.852 --> 01:02:11.643
<i>To conquer, three boxes
have to synchronize</i>


432
01:02:11.727 --> 01:02:15.018
<i>and join together
into The Unity.</i>


433
01:02:15.102 --> 01:02:18.185
<i>The Unity cleanses
a planet with fire,</i>


434
01:02:18.268 --> 01:02:21.977
<i>transforming it into a copy
of the enemy's world.</i>


435
01:02:22.060 --> 01:02:25.727
<i>All who live
become servants of Darkseid.</i>


436
01:02:25.810 --> 01:02:28.893
<i>Alive but drained of life.</i>

437
01:02:28.977 --> 01:02:30.393
<i>Parademons.</i>

438
01:02:31.560 --> 01:02:33.768
Amazons!

439
01:02:39.602 --> 01:02:41.310
With me!

440
01:03:10.352 --> 01:03:13.018
<i>But before The Unity
could synchronize,</i>


441
01:03:13.102 --> 01:03:15.227
<i>the defenders of Earth
attacked</i>


442
01:03:15.310 --> 01:03:17.060
<i>and fought as one.</i>

443
01:03:17.143 --> 01:03:20.268
<i>Amazons alongside Atlanteans.</i>

444
01:03:20.352 --> 01:03:21.977
<i>Zeus and his son Ares</i>

445
01:03:22.060 --> 01:03:25.643
<i>alongside the guardians
from the sky.</i>


446
01:03:25.727 --> 01:03:28.977
<i>A golden Age of Heroes
fighting together</i>


447
01:03:29.060 --> 01:03:30.685
<i>to defend life on Earth.</i>

448
01:05:27.061 --> 01:05:29.936
<i>They did what no world
had ever done.</i>


449
01:05:30.019 --> 01:05:32.394
<i>Sent the enemies
back into the stars.</i>


450
01:05:34.728 --> 01:05:38.478
<i>The three Mother Boxes
never synchronized.</i>


451
01:05:38.561 --> 01:05:41.936
<i>The Unity never came to pass.</i>

452
01:05:42.019 --> 01:05:44.644
<i>But, in their retreat,</i>

453
01:05:44.728 --> 01:05:47.936
<i>the boxes were left behind
on Earth.</i>


454
01:05:48.019 --> 01:05:52.019
<i>They grew weak.
Dogs without masters</i>


455
01:05:53.686 --> 01:05:55.353
<i>falling asleep,</i>

456
01:05:55.436 --> 01:05:57.853
<i>awaiting their return.</i>

457
01:05:57.936 --> 01:06:00.353
<i>Fading from the view
of the enemy,</i>


458
01:06:00.436 --> 01:06:03.936
<i>anonymous
among a trillion worlds.</i>


459
01:06:20.561 --> 01:06:24.061
<i>The defenders of Earth
made a vow.</i>


460
01:06:24.144 --> 01:06:27.478
<i>Men, Atlanteans, and Amazons.</i>

461
01:06:27.561 --> 01:06:29.311
<i>Each would enshrine and guard</i>

462
01:06:29.394 --> 01:06:31.394
<i>one of the three
sleeping Mother Boxes</i>


463
01:06:31.478 --> 01:06:35.144
<i>according to the rites
and rituals of their culture</i>


464
01:06:35.228 --> 01:06:37.978
<i>in case a box
should ever wake again</i>


465
01:06:38.061 --> 01:06:39.811
<i>to call out
to the planet Apokolips</i>


466
01:06:39.894 --> 01:06:41.644
<i>to return and conquer</i>

467
01:06:41.728 --> 01:06:45.853
<i>the only world
Darkseid had ever lost.</i>


468
01:08:01.519 --> 01:08:04.812
Something woke the box
my people guard.


469
01:08:04.895 --> 01:08:07.062
It called out
to the dark place...


470
01:08:07.145 --> 01:08:09.770
to one of Darkseid's
conquerors.


471
01:08:10.562 --> 01:08:12.854
The enemy is here.

472
01:08:12.937 --> 01:08:14.604
If he's here, where is he?

473
01:08:14.687 --> 01:08:16.812
He'll be searching
for the other two boxes.


474
01:08:16.895 --> 01:08:19.937
Hiding until he has all three.
Until he's ready.


475
01:08:20.020 --> 01:08:24.479
Then we have to be ready.
You, me, the others.


476
01:08:24.562 --> 01:08:27.687
They said the Age of Heroes
would never come again.


477
01:08:27.770 --> 01:08:29.270
No, it will.

478
01:08:29.354 --> 01:08:31.187
It has to.

479
01:08:32.687 --> 01:08:36.437
The others.
Where are they?


480
01:08:58.354 --> 01:08:59.354
Am I late?

481
01:08:59.437 --> 01:09:01.895
No, I'm so late.
I'm very late.


482
01:09:01.979 --> 01:09:03.645
Oh, hey, buddy. Hey.

483
01:09:03.729 --> 01:09:05.479
Oh. No.

484
01:09:05.562 --> 01:09:08.520
Okay, bye. Okay.

485
01:09:08.604 --> 01:09:10.979
I'm so sorry.

486
01:09:11.062 --> 01:09:12.395
I'm late.

487
01:09:17.687 --> 01:09:19.145
- Are you, uh...
- I'm...


488
01:09:19.229 --> 01:09:21.145
I'm so sorry I'm so late.
I didn't mean to be so late.


489
01:09:21.229 --> 01:09:22.854
I'm me and I'm here
and I'm so sorry I'm late.


490
01:09:22.937 --> 01:09:24.187
Essentially,
the bus didn't come,


491
01:09:24.270 --> 01:09:25.395
then the bus did come,

492
01:09:25.479 --> 01:09:26.520
but then there was
this old woman


493
01:09:26.604 --> 01:09:27.812
counting change for the fare,

494
01:09:27.895 --> 01:09:29.312
like, nickel, penny,
nickel, penny.


495
01:09:29.395 --> 01:09:30.979
Like, jeez Louise,
let this woman on the bus.


496
01:09:31.062 --> 01:09:32.395
She's 107 years old,

497
01:09:32.479 --> 01:09:34.020
these are some of her
last few moments of life.


498
01:09:34.104 --> 01:09:35.520
Resume.

499
01:09:35.604 --> 01:09:36.645
Resume.

500
01:09:39.854 --> 01:09:41.729
Come on.

501
01:09:44.312 --> 01:09:45.354
Come on.

502
01:09:45.437 --> 01:09:46.979
From the French, of course.

503
01:09:47.062 --> 01:09:50.354
<i>"Resume,"</i> I believe,
is a past participle of...


504
01:09:55.645 --> 01:09:57.395
Uh, wow. That's no good.

505
01:09:57.479 --> 01:09:59.187
It's like, what lives
in my pocket, right?


506
01:09:59.270 --> 01:10:02.062
"Paper monster hungry."
Uh...


507
01:10:10.020 --> 01:10:12.895
Come on. Supposed to be
friends now.


508
01:10:19.104 --> 01:10:20.562
Yes.

509
01:10:29.229 --> 01:10:31.729
Central City College,
I'm a criminal justice major.


510
01:10:31.812 --> 01:10:33.145
You said you had experience

511
01:10:33.229 --> 01:10:34.354
walking dogs.

512
01:13:14.646 --> 01:13:16.730
Oh, gosh,
I hope everyone's okay.


513
01:13:16.813 --> 01:13:19.521
See, in times of crisis,
for dog work,


514
01:13:19.605 --> 01:13:21.646
I always bring a meat snack.

515
01:13:21.730 --> 01:13:23.480
'Cause it makes them
feel calm.


516
01:13:23.563 --> 01:13:25.313
'Cause you never know what's
going to happen in this city.


517
01:13:25.396 --> 01:13:27.021
I mean, oh, my gosh.

518
01:13:27.105 --> 01:13:29.813
Right? I start on Monday?

519
01:14:07.896 --> 01:14:10.771
You have been
near a Mother Box.


520
01:14:11.855 --> 01:14:14.396
The scent is on you.

521
01:14:14.480 --> 01:14:15.896
Where is it?

522
01:14:15.980 --> 01:14:19.646
No son or daughter of Atlantis
will ever tell you.


523
01:14:34.521 --> 01:14:36.271
Our people have guarded
the Mother Box


524
01:14:36.355 --> 01:14:37.605
for thousands of years.

525
01:14:43.521 --> 01:14:46.396
I will never betray
my own people.


526
01:14:57.813 --> 01:15:00.396
You already have.

527
01:16:00.481 --> 01:16:03.397
<i>This was taken in
the deepest trench on Earth.</i>


528
01:16:03.481 --> 01:16:05.647
He must be an Atlantean.

529
01:16:05.731 --> 01:16:07.106
A water-breather.

530
01:16:07.189 --> 01:16:08.731
He was breathing air
when I talked to him.


531
01:16:08.814 --> 01:16:10.689
Mixed-blood, then.

532
01:16:10.772 --> 01:16:12.772
He said he'll fight with us?

533
01:16:12.856 --> 01:16:14.314
More or less.

534
01:16:15.522 --> 01:16:17.939
More more or more less?

535
01:16:18.022 --> 01:16:19.064
Probably more less.

536
01:16:19.147 --> 01:16:21.272
- He said no?
- He said no.


537
01:16:21.356 --> 01:16:23.897
Atlanteans
can be tricky.


538
01:16:23.981 --> 01:16:26.939
My people went to war
with them once.


539
01:16:27.897 --> 01:16:29.939
I'm not sure we can trust him.

540
01:16:30.022 --> 01:16:31.272
Diana,
if we're gonna do this,


541
01:16:31.356 --> 01:16:32.439
you're gonna need to be open

542
01:16:32.522 --> 01:16:33.897
to more things
that we didn't...


543
01:16:33.981 --> 01:16:35.106
you know...

544
01:16:35.189 --> 01:16:36.606
- I'm sorry. That's okay.
- Sorry. My fault.


545
01:16:36.689 --> 01:16:37.897
Don't worry about it.

546
01:16:37.981 --> 01:16:39.231
- Let's...
- It happens.


547
01:16:39.314 --> 01:16:40.856
so...

548
01:16:40.939 --> 01:16:42.522
This is the
third person.


549
01:16:42.606 --> 01:16:45.189
Disappears for 1/30
of a second here.


550
01:16:45.272 --> 01:16:46.856
One frame of video, see?

551
01:16:46.939 --> 01:16:49.606
Barry Allen. Central City.

552
01:16:49.689 --> 01:16:50.647
Go to him.

553
01:16:50.731 --> 01:16:52.439
I'll work on number four.

554
01:16:52.522 --> 01:16:55.689
Organic and biomechatronic
body parts.


555
01:16:58.314 --> 01:17:00.439
He's a cyborg.

556
01:17:19.397 --> 01:17:21.564
- Ready!
- Break!


557
01:17:36.939 --> 01:17:38.272
Three...

558
01:17:38.356 --> 01:17:39.981
eighty...

559
01:17:40.939 --> 01:17:43.147
set... go!

560
01:17:56.106 --> 01:17:58.522
<i>Your son may be captain
of the football team</i>


561
01:17:58.606 --> 01:18:01.856
and a certified genius,
Mrs. Stone...


562
01:18:01.939 --> 01:18:04.064
Dr. Stone.

563
01:18:06.356 --> 01:18:08.522
...but that doesn't mean
he can hack into our system


564
01:18:08.606 --> 01:18:11.189
to change his friend's grades.

565
01:18:11.272 --> 01:18:15.189
Sarah's family
lost their house this year.


566
01:18:15.272 --> 01:18:17.939
How could that child
pass her classes?


567
01:18:19.231 --> 01:18:22.481
Victor helped her
'cause he's got a good heart.


568
01:18:22.564 --> 01:18:24.731
What did you do to help her?

569
01:19:48.690 --> 01:19:51.815
- Your father...
- Mom, Mom, don't.


570
01:19:53.148 --> 01:19:56.107
He got held up at the lab.

571
01:19:56.190 --> 01:19:59.398
Okay. He always does.

572
01:20:01.815 --> 01:20:03.315
He wanted to be here.

573
01:20:03.398 --> 01:20:05.232
You always say that.

574
01:20:05.315 --> 01:20:06.982
Ma, you gotta stop
making excuses for him.


575
01:20:07.065 --> 01:20:09.982
You're just as busy as he is,
but you still make the time.


576
01:20:10.065 --> 01:20:13.857
He just has difficulty
showing it, but...


577
01:20:13.940 --> 01:20:16.232
I know he's proud of you.

578
01:20:16.315 --> 01:20:18.898
We both are, Victor.

579
01:20:18.982 --> 01:20:22.107
Hey, hey, hey.

580
01:20:22.190 --> 01:20:25.315
With everything I know
you can do today,


581
01:20:25.398 --> 01:20:28.148
I can't wait to see
what you're gonna be tomorrow.


582
01:20:33.523 --> 01:20:35.440
<i>Dr. Stone,
I'm sorry,</i>


583
01:20:36.398 --> 01:20:38.357
your wife didn't survive.

584
01:20:39.815 --> 01:20:42.148
I'm afraid
your son won't either.


585
01:20:56.107 --> 01:20:57.940
I won't let you die.

586
01:21:00.815 --> 01:21:02.482
I won't allow it.

587
01:21:08.648 --> 01:21:10.523
I won't allow it.

588
01:21:13.898 --> 01:21:14.982
Victor.

589
01:21:16.107 --> 01:21:19.607
Victor, you're not
stuck in here.


590
01:21:19.690 --> 01:21:22.982
You still have a life
ahead of you.


591
01:21:23.065 --> 01:21:26.648
Your mother would have
wanted you to live that life.


592
01:21:29.148 --> 01:21:30.857
If you were there,

593
01:21:32.065 --> 01:21:34.107
Mom would still be alive.

594
01:21:36.815 --> 01:21:38.815
All right, look,

595
01:21:39.982 --> 01:21:42.482
you don't have to give me
a second chance,


596
01:21:42.565 --> 01:21:44.273
but give yourself one.

597
01:21:46.065 --> 01:21:49.357
If you can't stand
looking at me,


598
01:21:50.940 --> 01:21:52.690
try listening.

599
01:22:21.148 --> 01:22:23.815
<i>What you can do now, Victor.</i>

600
01:22:23.898 --> 01:22:27.732
<i>Your physical strength is
just the tip of the iceberg.</i>


601
01:22:27.815 --> 01:22:30.523
<i>The tip of the tip.</i>

602
01:23:00.315 --> 01:23:02.523
<i>In the world
of ones and zeroes,</i>


603
01:23:02.607 --> 01:23:05.357
<i>you are the absolute master.</i>

604
01:23:05.440 --> 01:23:08.107
<i>No firewall can stop you.</i>

605
01:23:08.190 --> 01:23:10.565
<i>No encryption can defy you.</i>

606
01:23:10.648 --> 01:23:13.357
<i>We're all at your mercy, Vic.</i>

607
01:23:13.440 --> 01:23:15.982
<i>From our power grids
to our telecommunications,</i>


608
01:23:16.065 --> 01:23:18.148
<i>everyone's lives
are controlled</i>


609
01:23:18.232 --> 01:23:21.273
<i>and dominated
by complex digital networks</i>


610
01:23:21.357 --> 01:23:25.732
<i>that will bend
without effort to your will.</i>


611
01:23:35.941 --> 01:23:37.483
<i>The fate of the world</i>

612
01:23:37.566 --> 01:23:40.608
<i>will literally
rest in your hands.</i>


613
01:23:48.191 --> 01:23:50.316
<i>Its entire nuclear arsenal,</i>

614
01:23:50.399 --> 01:23:53.441
<i>you could launch
with a thought.</i>


615
01:24:04.024 --> 01:24:05.524
<i>The world's monetary systems</i>

616
01:24:05.608 --> 01:24:07.191
<i>and its complex interactions</i>

617
01:24:07.316 --> 01:24:10.233
<i>will seem as easy
to manipulate for you</i>


618
01:24:10.316 --> 01:24:12.066
<i>as a child's plaything.</i>

619
01:24:45.816 --> 01:24:49.858
<i>The question...
No, the challenge</i>


620
01:24:50.566 --> 01:24:53.774
<i>won't be doing it.</i>

621
01:24:53.858 --> 01:24:55.899
<i>It will be not doing.</i>

622
01:24:55.983 --> 01:24:58.108
<i>Not seeing.</i>

623
01:24:59.858 --> 01:25:02.191
<i>It is the burden
of this responsibility</i>


624
01:25:02.274 --> 01:25:05.899
<i>that will define you
and who you choose to be.</i>


625
01:25:37.358 --> 01:25:38.483
<i>Now, make a wish.</i>

626
01:25:39.733 --> 01:25:41.566
<i>One more time.</i>

627
01:25:41.649 --> 01:25:44.149
<i>Good job. Wave to Grandma!</i>

628
01:25:44.233 --> 01:25:45.566
<i>Hi, Grandma!</i>

629
01:26:45.608 --> 01:26:46.858
What?

630
01:26:48.691 --> 01:26:50.566
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!


631
01:26:51.691 --> 01:26:53.108
Oh, my God.

632
01:26:53.191 --> 01:26:55.108
Oh, my God. Oh, my God!

633
01:27:00.316 --> 01:27:03.066
<i>Victor...</i>

634
01:27:03.149 --> 01:27:07.649
<i>Victor, these are the words
and deductions of a scientist.</i>


635
01:27:07.733 --> 01:27:10.191
<i>That's how I've been
speaking to you.</i>


636
01:27:10.816 --> 01:27:13.691
<i>Now,</i>

637
01:27:13.774 --> 01:27:18.274
<i>let me speak to
you from my heart, not as a scientist,</i>


638
01:27:18.358 --> 01:27:19.691
<i>as a father.</i>

639
01:27:33.900 --> 01:27:35.150
Hey.

640
01:27:36.359 --> 01:27:38.067
Hey, you!

641
01:27:53.650 --> 01:27:57.150
<i>Because you are
holding yourself back.</i>


642
01:27:57.234 --> 01:28:00.317
You're going in circles, man.

643
01:28:00.400 --> 01:28:02.775
Holding down
three dead-end jobs,


644
01:28:02.859 --> 01:28:03.942
going on four.

645
01:28:04.025 --> 01:28:05.525
Where do you
even find the time?


646
01:28:05.609 --> 01:28:06.817
I make the time.

647
01:28:06.900 --> 01:28:08.275
- I just need one more gig...
- Barry.


648
01:28:08.359 --> 01:28:09.275
...then I'm gonna pay
for my own tuition.


649
01:28:09.359 --> 01:28:10.442
You can't.

650
01:28:10.525 --> 01:28:11.817
Like I always said
I would.


651
01:28:11.900 --> 01:28:13.442
You cannot keep
doing this to yourself.


652
01:28:13.525 --> 01:28:15.109
Okay. I really don't wanna
talk about this again.


653
01:28:15.192 --> 01:28:16.525
- Please, we have 10 minutes.
- And this is all to pay


654
01:28:16.609 --> 01:28:17.817
for a criminal justice degree,
huh?


655
01:28:17.900 --> 01:28:18.984
Yeah.

656
01:28:19.067 --> 01:28:20.317
For what?

657
01:28:20.400 --> 01:28:23.359
Huh, let's see.
As I talk to my father,


658
01:28:23.442 --> 01:28:24.984
who's still in prison
for the murder


659
01:28:25.067 --> 01:28:26.650
of my mother,
which he didn't commit.


660
01:28:26.734 --> 01:28:28.609
Yeah, how did I get interested
in criminal justice?


661
01:28:28.692 --> 01:28:30.359
I can't remember.

662
01:28:30.442 --> 01:28:31.609
Oh, boy.

663
01:28:31.692 --> 01:28:34.150
This path has clearly
chosen me, Dad.


664
01:28:34.984 --> 01:28:36.234
Give me your hand, man.

665
01:28:41.567 --> 01:28:44.817
I want you
to listen to me, Barry.


666
01:28:44.900 --> 01:28:48.734
I want you to listen to me,
because I mean this.


667
01:28:54.442 --> 01:28:56.567
I want you
to give all that up.


668
01:28:59.359 --> 01:29:02.609
And I want you to stop
coming to see me.


669
01:29:04.859 --> 01:29:08.025
I am a drag on your life.

670
01:29:13.317 --> 01:29:15.150
Okay. Um...

671
01:29:15.234 --> 01:29:18.859
Please don't ever
say that to me again.


672
01:29:18.942 --> 01:29:20.150
Please.

673
01:29:20.234 --> 01:29:21.775
Hey, you know what
criminal justice


674
01:29:21.859 --> 01:29:23.484
would be for me?

675
01:29:23.567 --> 01:29:28.484
My son not wasting his life.

676
01:29:29.734 --> 01:29:31.525
You can be
whatever you wanna be.


677
01:29:31.609 --> 01:29:33.109
You're brilliant, man.

678
01:29:35.442 --> 01:29:38.442
Absolute best of the best.

679
01:29:39.942 --> 01:29:44.984
I can't sit here and watch you
run in place in Central City


680
01:29:45.067 --> 01:29:46.859
for some old dude

681
01:29:46.942 --> 01:29:50.067
who's not going anywhere.

682
01:29:50.150 --> 01:29:51.734
- Dad, that's not true.
- It's time.


683
01:29:51.817 --> 01:29:53.025
That's not true.

684
01:29:53.109 --> 01:29:54.484
Let's go, Allen. Allen!

685
01:29:54.567 --> 01:29:56.234
I want you
to make your own future.


686
01:29:56.317 --> 01:29:58.192
You're living in the past.
Make your own future.


687
01:29:58.275 --> 01:29:59.859
Open gate.

688
01:29:59.942 --> 01:30:01.275
Great.

689
01:30:04.900 --> 01:30:07.192
"You're living in the past.
Make your own future, Barry."


690
01:30:07.275 --> 01:30:08.942
Clear.
Close the gate.


691
01:31:01.567 --> 01:31:04.984
Barry Allen. Bruce Wayne.

692
01:31:05.067 --> 01:31:06.650
You said that like it explains

693
01:31:06.734 --> 01:31:08.984
why there's a total stranger
in my place


694
01:31:09.067 --> 01:31:12.150
sitting in the dark,
in my second favorite chair.


695
01:31:14.109 --> 01:31:16.067
Tell me about this.

696
01:31:19.900 --> 01:31:22.818
This is a person
who looks exactly like me,


697
01:31:22.901 --> 01:31:25.776
but who is definitely not me.

698
01:31:26.735 --> 01:31:28.693
Somebody... I don't know.

699
01:31:28.776 --> 01:31:30.651
Hippie, long hair.

700
01:31:30.735 --> 01:31:33.693
Very attractive Jewish boy.

701
01:31:34.985 --> 01:31:37.735
Who drinks milk,
I don't drink milk.


702
01:31:37.818 --> 01:31:39.401
I know you have abilities.

703
01:31:39.485 --> 01:31:41.735
I just don't know
what they are.


704
01:31:41.818 --> 01:31:42.818
My special skills

705
01:31:42.901 --> 01:31:45.651
include viola, web design,

706
01:31:45.735 --> 01:31:48.693
fluent in sign language,
gorilla sign language.


707
01:31:48.776 --> 01:31:52.443
Silica-based
sand quartz fabric.


708
01:31:52.526 --> 01:31:54.693
Abrasion resistant,
heat resistant.


709
01:31:54.776 --> 01:31:56.693
Uh, yeah, I do
competitive ice dancing.


710
01:31:56.776 --> 01:31:58.693
It's what they use
on the space shuttle


711
01:31:58.776 --> 01:32:00.485
to prevent it from
burning up on re-entry.


712
01:32:00.568 --> 01:32:03.276
I do very competitive
ice dancing.


713
01:32:04.443 --> 01:32:06.443
Look, man.
I don't know who you are,


714
01:32:06.526 --> 01:32:08.735
but whoever
you're looking for,


715
01:32:08.818 --> 01:32:09.943
it's not me.

716
01:32:51.651 --> 01:32:53.568
You're the Batman?

717
01:32:53.651 --> 01:32:56.485
So, you're fast.

718
01:32:56.568 --> 01:32:58.235
That feels
like an oversimplification.


719
01:32:58.318 --> 01:33:00.151
I'm putting together a team.

720
01:33:00.235 --> 01:33:02.360
People with special abilities.

721
01:33:02.443 --> 01:33:04.110
You see,
I believe enemies are coming.


722
01:33:04.193 --> 01:33:06.401
Stop right there. I'm in.

723
01:33:07.401 --> 01:33:08.735
You are?

724
01:33:08.818 --> 01:33:09.985
Just like that?

725
01:33:10.068 --> 01:33:11.318
Yeah.

726
01:33:13.151 --> 01:33:15.651
I need friends.

727
01:33:15.735 --> 01:33:19.151
Great. Great.

728
01:33:19.235 --> 01:33:21.360
Can I keep this?

729
01:33:21.443 --> 01:33:23.318
It's like this layer
of dimensional reality,


730
01:33:23.401 --> 01:33:25.235
and it seems
to manipulate space-time.


731
01:33:25.318 --> 01:33:26.735
I call it the Speed Force.

732
01:33:26.818 --> 01:33:28.568
Causes me to burn a tremendous
amount of calories


733
01:33:28.651 --> 01:33:31.443
so I am just a black hole
of snacks.


734
01:33:31.526 --> 01:33:33.943
I am a snack hole.

735
01:33:34.026 --> 01:33:37.068
How many people are
on this special fight team?


736
01:33:37.151 --> 01:33:39.235
- Three, including you.
- Three?


737
01:33:39.318 --> 01:33:41.943
Against what?

738
01:33:42.026 --> 01:33:43.651
I'll tell you on the plane.

739
01:33:44.193 --> 01:33:45.818
Plane?

740
01:33:45.901 --> 01:33:47.901
What are your
superpowers again?


741
01:33:47.985 --> 01:33:49.776
I'm rich.

742
01:34:12.651 --> 01:34:14.485
Oh, Miss Prince,
let me do that.


743
01:34:14.568 --> 01:34:17.651
No, that's okay.
I can do it myself.


744
01:34:17.735 --> 01:34:19.485
Would you like
to have some?


745
01:34:19.568 --> 01:34:20.985
Uh, no, thank you.

746
01:34:22.151 --> 01:34:24.651
If you put the water in first.

747
01:34:24.735 --> 01:34:28.068
- Of course.
- So we don't scald the tea.


748
01:34:30.818 --> 01:34:32.360
- Yes.
- Great.


749
01:34:32.443 --> 01:34:34.651
No, that's probably
enough tea.


750
01:34:34.735 --> 01:34:37.026
All right.

751
01:34:37.110 --> 01:34:38.651
Are you sure you don't
wanna have some?


752
01:34:38.735 --> 01:34:42.735
I won't, thank you.
And then leave it to mash.


753
01:34:42.818 --> 01:34:45.860
I will.
I will, definitely will.


754
01:34:45.943 --> 01:34:48.276
Uh... What are you working on?

755
01:34:48.360 --> 01:34:50.026
It's a gauntlet

756
01:34:50.110 --> 01:34:54.026
lined with specialized
polymer solar cells.


757
01:34:54.110 --> 01:34:56.526
- Wow.
- Here, let me show you.


758
01:34:56.610 --> 01:34:59.776
We borrowed this from
the Kryptonian scout ship.


759
01:35:01.276 --> 01:35:02.776
Oh, maybe you should, uh...

760
01:35:02.860 --> 01:35:04.276
a fraction.
Thank you, thank you.


761
01:35:04.360 --> 01:35:05.568
Of course.

762
01:35:10.610 --> 01:35:12.318
Ah.

763
01:35:12.401 --> 01:35:15.527
Ah, now,
let's see how that did.


764
01:35:15.611 --> 01:35:17.944
Ha! Yes.

765
01:35:18.027 --> 01:35:19.611
Not to be sneezed at.

766
01:35:19.694 --> 01:35:22.319
A gauntlet that captures
and dissipates energy.


767
01:35:22.402 --> 01:35:24.027
It's Master Wayne's idea.

768
01:35:24.111 --> 01:35:26.486
Maybe you should work
on a lasso, too?


769
01:35:26.569 --> 01:35:29.402
- In black, of course.
- Oh.


770
01:35:36.152 --> 01:35:39.319
All right. Victor Stone.

771
01:35:55.402 --> 01:35:57.861
Something is not working.

772
01:35:57.944 --> 01:35:59.694
Mmm.

773
01:36:09.152 --> 01:36:11.777
Looks like you have a date,
Miss Prince.


774
01:37:08.611 --> 01:37:11.861
Why are you looking
for me, Diana?


775
01:37:11.944 --> 01:37:13.236
You know who I am.

776
01:37:13.319 --> 01:37:15.652
I know more than you
can possibly imagine.


777
01:37:15.736 --> 01:37:19.069
Then maybe you already know
I need your help.


778
01:37:19.152 --> 01:37:20.319
The world does.

779
01:37:21.569 --> 01:37:23.361
Fuck the world.

780
01:37:24.736 --> 01:37:27.361
You've obviously
been through a great deal.


781
01:37:28.444 --> 01:37:31.486
I can't begin to imagine what.

782
01:37:31.569 --> 01:37:35.319
But whatever happened to you,
you have gifts now.


783
01:37:35.402 --> 01:37:37.027
Gifts?

784
01:37:37.111 --> 01:37:39.444
What part of this
looks like a gift to you?


785
01:37:39.527 --> 01:37:41.277
We need you, Victor.

786
01:37:41.361 --> 01:37:43.027
And maybe you need us.

787
01:37:43.111 --> 01:37:44.944
I don't need anyone.

788
01:37:47.027 --> 01:37:48.152
Not anymore.

789
01:37:48.236 --> 01:37:50.861
I told myself the same
for a long time.


790
01:37:57.486 --> 01:38:00.402
I lost someone I loved once.

791
01:38:03.111 --> 01:38:08.069
I shut myself off
from everyone.


792
01:38:09.486 --> 01:38:12.444
But I had to learn
to open back up again.


793
01:38:14.902 --> 01:38:18.444
The truth is,
I'm still working on it.


794
01:38:18.527 --> 01:38:22.569
And if you asked to meet me...

795
01:38:22.652 --> 01:38:25.527
you're working on it, too.

796
01:39:37.028 --> 01:39:39.112
You were right
about the metal sample


797
01:39:39.195 --> 01:39:40.737
from the Superman ship.

798
01:39:40.820 --> 01:39:44.445
When we bombard it with X-rays
from the electron-laser,


799
01:39:44.528 --> 01:39:46.112
look what happens.

800
01:39:54.945 --> 01:39:56.820
3.5 million kelvin.

801
01:39:56.903 --> 01:40:00.112
The inner core of the metal
becomes superheated.


802
01:40:00.195 --> 01:40:02.653
Hot, dense matter.

803
01:40:05.653 --> 01:40:08.653
You're looking at
the hottest thing on Earth.


804
01:40:08.737 --> 01:40:11.028
Exact words I said
to my prom date.


805
01:40:11.112 --> 01:40:12.695
She dumped me anyway.

806
01:40:12.778 --> 01:40:14.112
Yeah.

807
01:40:18.237 --> 01:40:19.320
Hey, Doc,

808
01:40:19.403 --> 01:40:21.112
do you think
Batman is connected


809
01:40:21.195 --> 01:40:23.903
to the object
the CID is looking for?


810
01:40:24.820 --> 01:40:28.112
You know, 6-1-9-8-2?

811
01:40:29.195 --> 01:40:30.362
No...

812
01:40:31.278 --> 01:40:32.570
I don't.

813
01:41:07.278 --> 01:41:09.487
Oh, Victor.

814
01:41:26.445 --> 01:41:28.528
All right! Let's go!

815
01:41:29.653 --> 01:41:30.945
Commissioner Gordon?

816
01:41:31.028 --> 01:41:32.237
Come on!

817
01:41:32.320 --> 01:41:33.528
Your messages.

818
01:41:33.612 --> 01:41:35.028
Hey, hey!

819
01:41:37.778 --> 01:41:40.403
Don't have to see the sky
to know it's a full moon.


820
01:41:40.487 --> 01:41:43.445
Half of Gotham's reality-challenged
community showed up.


821
01:41:43.528 --> 01:41:45.820
Say they saw flying monsters
by the harbor.


822
01:41:45.903 --> 01:41:47.945
You were right, Ma.
Police Academy.


823
01:41:48.028 --> 01:41:49.903
What's wrong
with dental school?


824
01:41:52.778 --> 01:41:55.945
"Attacked by
a flying vampire."


825
01:41:56.028 --> 01:41:59.112
"Looked like a giant bat
with huge fangs."


826
01:41:59.195 --> 01:42:01.028
On a possibly related note,

827
01:42:01.112 --> 01:42:03.487
sketch of the suspect
in the abductions


828
01:42:03.570 --> 01:42:05.112
at the lab across the harbor.

829
01:42:05.195 --> 01:42:08.445
- Looks like...
- I know what it looks like, Crispus.


830
01:42:08.528 --> 01:42:11.112
Come on, you think he fights
criminals for 20 years here


831
01:42:11.195 --> 01:42:14.195
and then he goes to Metropolis
and kidnaps eight people?


832
01:42:15.070 --> 01:42:16.320
I'll talk to him tonight.

833
01:42:16.403 --> 01:42:17.987
How, Jim?

834
01:42:18.070 --> 01:42:19.653
How do you think?

835
01:42:37.737 --> 01:42:39.195
Silas?

836
01:42:39.278 --> 01:42:40.570
Hey, hey.

837
01:42:40.653 --> 01:42:42.070
Hey, hey!

838
01:42:46.570 --> 01:42:48.987
- Oh, my goodness.
- Where's the cyborg?


839
01:42:49.070 --> 01:42:50.320
His name is Victor.

840
01:42:51.028 --> 01:42:53.945
We met, spoke.

841
01:42:54.778 --> 01:42:56.862
Give him time.

842
01:42:56.945 --> 01:42:58.862
You must be Barry. I'm Diana.

843
01:42:58.945 --> 01:43:02.779
Hi, Barry. I'm Diana.
That's not right. Great.


844
01:43:02.863 --> 01:43:05.279
- So, this is us.
- Yeah, this is us.


845
01:43:05.363 --> 01:43:06.613
Oh!

846
01:43:06.696 --> 01:43:09.488
Awesome! It's the Bat-Signal.
That's your...


847
01:43:09.571 --> 01:43:11.821
- Oh, sorry.
- That's your signal.


848
01:43:11.904 --> 01:43:13.363
That means we have to go now.

849
01:43:13.446 --> 01:43:17.238
- Yeah, that's what that means.
- It's so cool.


850
01:44:14.321 --> 01:44:16.071
Commander Mera,
I told the king


851
01:44:16.154 --> 01:44:17.988
the perimeter guards
were taken.


852
01:44:18.071 --> 01:44:19.654
He won't send reinforcements.

853
01:44:19.738 --> 01:44:22.404
He says all the reserves are
needed in the rebel regions.


854
01:44:22.488 --> 01:44:26.904
He's as shortsighted
as he is cruel.


855
01:44:26.988 --> 01:44:28.613
All right, take what men
we have left


856
01:44:28.696 --> 01:44:30.571
and form a phalanx
around the Mother Box.


857
01:46:10.404 --> 01:46:12.529
You can't escape.

858
01:46:13.196 --> 01:46:15.279
I'm not trying to.

859
01:48:17.614 --> 01:48:19.905
Vulko told me
you would come.


860
01:48:19.989 --> 01:48:22.905
The firstborn
of beloved Queen Atlanna.


861
01:48:25.489 --> 01:48:26.822
Wait.

862
01:48:28.780 --> 01:48:29.947
Please.

863
01:48:33.447 --> 01:48:34.905
I knew her.

864
01:48:36.989 --> 01:48:39.364
Well, that makes one of us.

865
01:48:39.447 --> 01:48:41.239
My parents died in the wars.

866
01:48:43.030 --> 01:48:44.530
She took me in.

867
01:48:44.614 --> 01:48:46.364
What a saint.

868
01:48:46.447 --> 01:48:48.614
You dare speak
of Queen Atlanna that way?


869
01:48:48.697 --> 01:48:51.489
Your queen left me
on my father's doorstep


870
01:48:51.572 --> 01:48:53.197
and never gave me
another thought.


871
01:48:53.280 --> 01:48:56.530
Your mother left you
to save your life.


872
01:48:56.614 --> 01:48:59.322
You cannot imagine
how it hurt her.


873
01:49:00.780 --> 01:49:02.905
What it cost her.

874
01:49:03.947 --> 01:49:06.364
But you're not
a defenseless child now.


875
01:49:08.530 --> 01:49:10.197
It would have been
her responsibility


876
01:49:10.280 --> 01:49:13.697
to follow that monster
to the surface and stop him.


877
01:49:14.239 --> 01:49:15.405
Now,

878
01:49:16.572 --> 01:49:18.030
it's yours.

879
01:50:22.280 --> 01:50:23.780
Yes.

880
01:50:46.615 --> 01:50:48.031
<i>Steppenwolf,</i>

881
01:50:48.115 --> 01:50:50.073
tell me what you've learned.

882
01:50:50.156 --> 01:50:52.823
Two boxes
found and awake.


883
01:50:52.906 --> 01:50:55.948
With the combined power
of the two Mother Boxes,


884
01:50:56.031 --> 01:50:59.198
I've been able to finish
the stronghold's defenses.


885
01:50:59.281 --> 01:51:01.740
Where is the third Mother Box?

886
01:51:01.823 --> 01:51:04.406
The parademons
sense its presence


887
01:51:04.490 --> 01:51:06.115
and search for the third.

888
01:51:06.198 --> 01:51:07.323
They have taken prisoners

889
01:51:07.406 --> 01:51:09.615
who carry its scent.

890
01:51:10.281 --> 01:51:11.990
Go.

891
01:51:12.073 --> 01:51:14.156
Interrogate the prisoners.

892
01:51:14.865 --> 01:51:16.865
Find the third.

893
01:51:18.156 --> 01:51:20.573
They will tell me
what they know,


894
01:51:21.615 --> 01:51:24.323
or I will rip it from them.

895
01:52:07.490 --> 01:52:09.198
How many of you are there?

896
01:52:09.990 --> 01:52:11.198
Not enough.

897
01:52:12.990 --> 01:52:15.406
Dozens of witnesses
all over Gotham.


898
01:52:15.490 --> 01:52:16.781
Description
matches the suspect


899
01:52:16.865 --> 01:52:18.781
in the Metropolis abductions.

900
01:52:18.865 --> 01:52:19.990
Parademons.

901
01:52:20.573 --> 01:52:21.990
Okay.

902
01:52:22.073 --> 01:52:24.406
The demons must have caught
the scent of a Mother Box.


903
01:52:24.490 --> 01:52:25.906
At the lab.

904
01:52:25.990 --> 01:52:27.990
They carried people away
to find out what they know.


905
01:52:28.073 --> 01:52:29.323
So the eight
may still be alive.


906
01:52:29.406 --> 01:52:30.365
Nine.

907
01:52:30.448 --> 01:52:32.240
Oh.

908
01:52:32.323 --> 01:52:35.073
The head of STARLABS
was taken tonight.


909
01:52:40.073 --> 01:52:42.781
Wow, okay.
So, another scientist.


910
01:52:42.865 --> 01:52:44.240
So, how do we find him?

911
01:52:44.323 --> 01:52:45.948
There must be a nest nearby.

912
01:52:46.031 --> 01:52:50.281
I plotted all the sightings
in Metropolis, Gotham.


913
01:52:50.365 --> 01:52:52.531
No discernable pattern
I can see.


914
01:52:52.615 --> 01:52:54.156
The lines on the map
don't converge.


915
01:52:54.240 --> 01:52:55.531
On land.

916
01:52:55.615 --> 01:52:57.073
These lead back
to Stryker's Island,


917
01:52:57.156 --> 01:52:58.323
between the two cities.

918
01:52:58.406 --> 01:52:59.531
These are air vents.

919
01:52:59.615 --> 01:53:01.115
They all lead
down to the tunnel


920
01:53:01.198 --> 01:53:03.365
to a Metropolis project
that was abandoned in '29.


921
01:53:03.448 --> 01:53:05.740
The nest could be there.

922
01:53:05.823 --> 01:53:07.781
Uh,
is he coming with us now,


923
01:53:07.865 --> 01:53:09.781
because we're not all
gonna fit in your car.


924
01:53:09.865 --> 01:53:11.406
I have something bigger.

925
01:53:12.615 --> 01:53:15.323
Do you really think that...

926
01:53:15.406 --> 01:53:19.156
Oh, wow, they just...
They really just vanish, huh?


927
01:53:19.240 --> 01:53:21.865
Oh. That's rude.

928
01:54:00.406 --> 01:54:02.573
We're close.

929
01:54:02.656 --> 01:54:04.823
The scent of the enemy.

930
01:54:05.448 --> 01:54:06.656
Of absence.

931
01:54:07.198 --> 01:54:08.781
Darkness.

932
01:54:09.448 --> 01:54:10.698
Death.

933
01:54:10.781 --> 01:54:12.073
Where are we, Alfred?

934
01:54:12.156 --> 01:54:13.198
<i>Stryker's Island.</i>

935
01:54:13.281 --> 01:54:15.365
You should be directly under

936
01:54:15.448 --> 01:54:18.240
the venting tower
for the tunnel.


937
01:54:18.323 --> 01:54:19.698
<i>Now look to your left,</i>

938
01:54:19.781 --> 01:54:21.698
<i>you'll see a staircase
to the machine room.</i>


939
01:54:21.781 --> 01:54:24.531
<i>Thermal scan shows
a cluster of people there.</i>


940
01:54:24.615 --> 01:54:25.948
That's it.

941
01:54:26.031 --> 01:54:27.365
Let's go.

942
01:54:41.241 --> 01:54:44.032
Right.
Is there... Is there a plan?


943
01:54:45.491 --> 01:54:46.741
Either of you?

944
01:54:46.824 --> 01:54:48.782
Don't engage alone.

945
01:54:48.866 --> 01:54:50.241
We do this together.

946
01:54:59.116 --> 01:55:01.074
I heard about you.

947
01:55:02.657 --> 01:55:04.241
Didn't think you were real.

948
01:55:04.324 --> 01:55:05.991
I'm real when it's useful.

949
01:55:15.991 --> 01:55:17.907
I grow tired of your silence.

950
01:55:17.991 --> 01:55:20.241
Now tell me,
where is the Mother Box?


951
01:55:27.074 --> 01:55:29.366
Please. We have families.

952
01:55:29.449 --> 01:55:31.657
Then you have weakness.

953
01:55:31.741 --> 01:55:33.116
Steppenwolf.

954
01:55:33.199 --> 01:55:37.616
Okay, I'm guessing
that's the bad guy.


955
01:55:37.699 --> 01:55:39.032
Good guess.

956
01:55:39.116 --> 01:55:42.782
I'm really, really missing
Superman right now.


957
01:55:42.866 --> 01:55:45.032
Circle to the other side.

958
01:55:45.116 --> 01:55:47.366
We'll surround them
and surprise him.


959
01:55:51.699 --> 01:55:53.699
You have been
near a Mother Box.


960
01:55:53.782 --> 01:55:55.449
The scent is on you.

961
01:55:55.532 --> 01:55:57.116
I don't know
what you're talking about.


962
01:55:57.199 --> 01:55:59.199
- Where is it?
- Leave him alone!


963
01:55:59.282 --> 01:56:01.657
He... He doesn't know.

964
01:56:05.074 --> 01:56:06.949
Wait, please, please!

965
01:56:12.449 --> 01:56:15.491
You carry
the scent, too. But stronger.


966
01:56:15.574 --> 01:56:17.824
I will die before I tell you.

967
01:56:17.907 --> 01:56:20.157
You'll die if you don't.

968
01:56:20.241 --> 01:56:21.324
No!

969
01:56:30.574 --> 01:56:31.574
Victor.

970
01:56:31.657 --> 01:56:33.032
Kill them both.

971
01:56:36.574 --> 01:56:38.949
Ah, Amazon.

972
01:56:39.032 --> 01:56:41.699
But not like your sisters.

973
01:56:41.782 --> 01:56:43.074
Stronger.

974
01:57:13.949 --> 01:57:16.282
Amazon.

975
01:57:18.616 --> 01:57:20.241
Hold!

976
01:57:20.324 --> 01:57:22.657
This one will be mine.

977
01:57:24.491 --> 01:57:27.074
I belong to no one.

978
01:57:40.949 --> 01:57:43.116
Guys, this is not together.

979
01:57:49.907 --> 01:57:51.407
Help get those people
out of here.


980
01:57:51.491 --> 01:57:53.532
I'll make sure these things
follow me.


981
01:58:03.407 --> 01:58:04.991
Everybody, move!

982
01:58:13.657 --> 01:58:15.282
A little quicker.

983
01:58:17.491 --> 01:58:18.949
- Are you good?
- Yeah.


984
01:58:19.032 --> 01:58:21.616
I've got this. Keep moving.

985
01:58:23.449 --> 01:58:24.532
This way.

986
01:59:00.742 --> 01:59:02.325
The energy
is dissipating.


987
01:59:02.408 --> 01:59:04.992
<i>My gauntlet worked!</i>

988
01:59:05.075 --> 01:59:07.533
Celebrate later, Alfred.
I need the Nightcrawler.


989
01:59:07.617 --> 01:59:09.617
Thought you'd never ask.

990
01:59:09.700 --> 01:59:12.117
Crawler's on the way.
Initiating remote mode.


991
01:59:42.117 --> 01:59:43.242
Thank you, Alfred.

992
01:59:43.325 --> 01:59:44.658
Don't mention it.

993
02:00:07.450 --> 02:00:08.533
No!

994
02:00:12.117 --> 02:00:13.200
Whew.

995
02:00:16.325 --> 02:00:17.825
They're safe.
Get back to the tunnel.


996
02:00:17.908 --> 02:00:21.325
Tunnel. Right.
Aliens, bad guy, sword lady.


997
02:00:32.992 --> 02:00:34.408
My turn.

998
02:01:56.533 --> 02:01:58.158
Catastrophic failure
of all systems.


999
02:01:58.242 --> 02:02:00.825
Are you all right,
Master Wayne?


1000
02:02:00.908 --> 02:02:02.075
Are you all right?

1001
02:02:12.492 --> 02:02:16.242
You have the blood
of the old gods in you.


1002
02:02:30.534 --> 02:02:31.618
You okay?

1003
02:02:32.118 --> 02:02:33.368
Mm.

1004
02:02:33.451 --> 02:02:35.243
Wasn't sure you'd come.

1005
02:02:36.159 --> 02:02:37.576
You're my father.

1006
02:02:40.993 --> 02:02:42.076
Go.

1007
02:02:55.618 --> 02:02:56.701
No!

1008
02:03:41.909 --> 02:03:44.534
Relax, Alfred.
I'll take it from here.


1009
02:03:46.034 --> 02:03:47.951
Uh, do I know you?

1010
02:04:18.701 --> 02:04:20.076
What are we under, right now?

1011
02:04:20.743 --> 02:04:22.118
Gotham Harbor.

1012
02:05:00.743 --> 02:05:02.118
Who is that?

1013
02:05:27.368 --> 02:05:28.659
Come on.

1014
02:05:33.659 --> 02:05:34.951
Diana, get on!

1015
02:06:36.785 --> 02:06:38.410
What is it?

1016
02:06:46.119 --> 02:06:47.619
Show me.

1017
02:07:26.660 --> 02:07:28.410
It is here.

1018
02:07:29.035 --> 02:07:32.119
On this world.

1019
02:08:05.827 --> 02:08:07.327
Sir, you're gonna
be in quarantine


1020
02:08:07.410 --> 02:08:08.827
for possible alien microbes.

1021
02:08:08.910 --> 02:08:10.702
U.S. government protocols
require that...


1022
02:08:10.785 --> 02:08:13.785
I know the requirements.
I wrote them.


1023
02:08:18.119 --> 02:08:19.619
It called to him.

1024
02:08:19.702 --> 02:08:21.285
The Mother Box.

1025
02:08:21.369 --> 02:08:22.869
The one he already has.

1026
02:08:22.952 --> 02:08:26.119
He has two. He took
the Mother Box from Atlantis.


1027
02:08:26.202 --> 02:08:28.619
All he needs now
is the lost Box of Men.


1028
02:08:28.702 --> 02:08:30.077
If he doesn't already have it.

1029
02:08:33.619 --> 02:08:35.160
He doesn't have it.

1030
02:08:38.327 --> 02:08:39.577
I do.

1031
02:08:49.910 --> 02:08:52.160
Have you finished
the conquest?


1032
02:08:52.244 --> 02:08:53.535
Not yet, DeSaad.

1033
02:08:53.619 --> 02:08:55.994
Then why do you summon me?

1034
02:08:56.077 --> 02:08:57.660
I bring news.

1035
02:08:57.744 --> 02:09:00.744
Before mighty Darkseid
came to the throne,


1036
02:09:00.827 --> 02:09:05.994
he searched the universe
for the ultimate weapon.


1037
02:09:06.077 --> 02:09:08.244
The Anti
-Life Equation.

1038
02:09:08.327 --> 02:09:10.410
The key to
controlling all life


1039
02:09:10.494 --> 02:09:12.952
and all will
throughout the multiverse.


1040
02:09:13.035 --> 02:09:16.244
He found it hidden on a primitive
planet, but before...


1041
02:09:16.327 --> 02:09:19.327
The story of the defiance
is well-known.


1042
02:09:19.410 --> 02:09:22.077
I have found
the primitive planet.


1043
02:09:22.160 --> 02:09:24.327
The world that fought back.

1044
02:09:24.410 --> 02:09:26.285
It is Earth.

1045
02:09:26.369 --> 02:09:28.619
The Anti-Life Equation
is carved


1046
02:09:28.702 --> 02:09:32.744
into the surface
of this very world.


1047
02:09:36.369 --> 02:09:37.869
Are you certain?

1048
02:09:37.952 --> 02:09:38.952
I have seen it.

1049
02:09:39.035 --> 02:09:42.494
I have looked
with my own eyes.


1050
02:09:44.160 --> 02:09:45.160
Anti
-Life.

1051
02:10:25.953 --> 02:10:27.620
My lord.

1052
02:10:29.078 --> 02:10:32.995
Oh, Steppenwolf.

1053
02:10:33.078 --> 02:10:37.120
My lord, I am
but your humble servant.


1054
02:10:37.203 --> 02:10:40.161
Can it be true
that you have found it?


1055
02:10:40.245 --> 02:10:43.203
I have, great one.

1056
02:10:43.286 --> 02:10:46.328
The lost world is Earth.

1057
02:10:46.411 --> 02:10:50.495
Anti
-Life is here.

1058
02:10:50.578 --> 02:10:53.911
If it is redemption you seek,
find the third box,


1059
02:10:53.995 --> 02:10:57.203
synchronize The Unity,
and when this world is scorched,


1060
02:10:57.286 --> 02:11:00.703
I will come
for my great prize.


1061
02:11:01.495 --> 02:11:04.578
You will come to Earth?

1062
02:11:04.661 --> 02:11:09.078
I have turned

1063
02:11:09.161 --> 02:11:10.661
looking for Anti
-Life.

1064
02:11:10.745 --> 02:11:14.036
Looking for those
who robbed me of my glory.


1065
02:11:14.120 --> 02:11:17.370
I will stride
across their bones


1066
02:11:17.453 --> 02:11:20.036
and bask in the glow
of Anti-Life.


1067
02:11:20.120 --> 02:11:22.953
And all of existence

1068
02:11:23.036 --> 02:11:26.536
shall be mine.

1069
02:11:29.911 --> 02:11:33.995
It shall be so, my master.

1070
02:11:38.078 --> 02:11:39.703
So cool.

1071
02:11:39.786 --> 02:11:42.870
From the outside,
it looks like this building was abandoned.


1072
02:11:46.203 --> 02:11:48.078
It wants to fly.

1073
02:11:49.120 --> 02:11:51.161
You talk to machines?

1074
02:11:51.245 --> 02:11:53.328
I speak
to intelligence.


1075
02:11:53.411 --> 02:11:54.703
This one's saying
she can't fly


1076
02:11:54.786 --> 02:11:56.328
because of a software issue,

1077
02:11:56.411 --> 02:11:58.578
but I could fix it
with a little time.


1078
02:12:08.161 --> 02:12:10.620
There's a dark spot
in my data stream.


1079
02:12:10.703 --> 02:12:13.120
I could feel
the other two boxes.


1080
02:12:13.203 --> 02:12:15.036
I know they're awake,

1081
02:12:15.120 --> 02:12:16.703
but I can't see
where they are.


1082
02:12:16.786 --> 02:12:18.995
Well, we can't attack unless
we know where the base is.


1083
02:12:19.078 --> 02:12:21.245
Even if we knew,

1084
02:12:21.328 --> 02:12:24.453
I've never seen a being
as strong as Steppenwolf.


1085
02:12:26.536 --> 02:12:27.870
Maybe one.

1086
02:12:27.953 --> 02:12:30.328
Hmm, Superman.

1087
02:12:30.411 --> 02:12:32.120
As long as
the third box is asleep,


1088
02:12:32.203 --> 02:12:34.536
they can't see it,
only sense it.


1089
02:12:34.620 --> 02:12:36.870
We need to keep moving
so they can't catch up.


1090
02:12:36.953 --> 02:12:38.495
No. That's just a strategy

1091
02:12:38.578 --> 02:12:40.578
to lose more slowly,
not to win.


1092
02:12:40.661 --> 02:12:43.495
Remind me, are flamethrowers
not a thing?


1093
02:12:43.578 --> 02:12:44.745
Why don't we just destroy it?

1094
02:12:44.828 --> 02:12:46.953
Fire doesn't
destroy the boxes.


1095
02:12:47.036 --> 02:12:48.870
They're an unknown form
of matter.


1096
02:12:48.953 --> 02:12:50.203
Oh, they love heat.

1097
02:12:50.286 --> 02:12:52.536
They absorb it,
hold it in their cores.


1098
02:12:52.620 --> 02:12:55.370
Well, you know
a lot about these boxes.


1099
02:12:55.453 --> 02:12:56.661
Makes you think.

1100
02:12:56.745 --> 02:12:59.328
Where'd you find the box,
Victor?


1101
02:12:59.411 --> 02:13:01.161
Are you trying
to say something?


1102
02:13:01.245 --> 02:13:03.120
Oh, I'm saying it.

1103
02:13:03.203 --> 02:13:05.286
How do we know you're not
working for them?


1104
02:13:07.078 --> 02:13:09.036
It's a long story.

1105
02:13:09.120 --> 02:13:11.203
You got somewhere else to be?

1106
02:13:18.453 --> 02:13:19.995
The Nazis found the box

1107
02:13:20.078 --> 02:13:22.286
at the end
of the Second World War,


1108
02:13:22.370 --> 02:13:25.495
buried under
an Italian monastery.


1109
02:13:25.578 --> 02:13:27.995
The Allies intercepted it
on its way to Hitler.


1110
02:13:28.078 --> 02:13:30.953
They brought it back
to the States in '44.


1111
02:13:31.036 --> 02:13:35.286
Unknown object 6-1-9-8-2.

1112
02:13:35.370 --> 02:13:37.370
It collected dust
in the Pentagon archives


1113
02:13:37.453 --> 02:13:39.245
for 70 years

1114
02:13:39.328 --> 02:13:42.828
till DoD began to study
the Superman ship.


1115
02:13:44.120 --> 02:13:46.620
A researcher at STARLABS
made a connection


1116
02:13:46.703 --> 02:13:47.870
between the ship...

1117
02:13:49.036 --> 02:13:51.203
and 6-1-9-8-2.

1118
02:13:51.286 --> 02:13:54.870
He understood they were
both alien technologies.


1119
02:13:54.953 --> 02:13:57.036
Different civilizations,

1120
02:13:57.120 --> 02:14:00.286
similar properties.

1121
02:14:00.370 --> 02:14:03.703
And though the box had slept
for thousands of years,


1122
02:14:03.786 --> 02:14:07.371
the researcher formulated
a theory on how to awaken it.


1123
02:14:07.454 --> 02:14:09.329
And so did.

1124
02:14:11.579 --> 02:14:12.662
Then...

1125
02:14:14.537 --> 02:14:17.704
I had an accident
that should've killed me.


1126
02:14:17.787 --> 02:14:21.037
But in an act of desperation
or madness,


1127
02:14:21.121 --> 02:14:23.704
the researcher harnessed
the power of the Mother Box.


1128
02:14:39.662 --> 02:14:41.912
He unleashed
an alien technology


1129
02:14:41.996 --> 02:14:44.662
he didn't fully understand.

1130
02:14:44.746 --> 02:14:47.371
He used that power
to keep me alive.


1131
02:14:50.871 --> 02:14:52.871
Alive...

1132
02:14:52.954 --> 02:14:55.079
but turned into this.

1133
02:14:57.704 --> 02:15:00.162
The box went back to sleep

1134
02:15:00.912 --> 02:15:02.746
and he never returned it.

1135
02:15:05.162 --> 02:15:07.412
That researcher
was Silas Stone.


1136
02:15:09.037 --> 02:15:10.746
My father.

1137
02:15:13.996 --> 02:15:15.537
Wait,

1138
02:15:15.621 --> 02:15:19.121
your father saved your life
with one of these things?


1139
02:15:19.204 --> 02:15:21.621
Aren't they
psycho murder machines?


1140
02:15:21.704 --> 02:15:23.954
They're change machines.

1141
02:15:24.037 --> 02:15:27.246
The boxes don't think in terms
of healing or killing,


1142
02:15:27.329 --> 02:15:29.287
alive or dead.

1143
02:15:29.371 --> 02:15:31.871
They rearrange matter
at the will of their masters,


1144
02:15:31.954 --> 02:15:33.662
regenerate, reinstate.

1145
02:15:33.746 --> 02:15:35.162
Reinstate?

1146
02:15:35.246 --> 02:15:36.621
A box has the power

1147
02:15:36.704 --> 02:15:38.704
to reinstate anterior
particle relationships.


1148
02:15:38.787 --> 02:15:40.746
So, you mean in the way
that particles of matter


1149
02:15:40.829 --> 02:15:41.996
can't be created or destroyed,

1150
02:15:42.079 --> 02:15:44.121
their relations
just transform.


1151
02:15:44.204 --> 02:15:47.037
Burn down a house,
the particles still exist.


1152
02:15:47.121 --> 02:15:49.662
Particles of house
become particles of smoke.


1153
02:15:49.746 --> 02:15:54.079
Anybody with a match
can turn a house to smoke.


1154
02:15:55.954 --> 02:15:57.704
But a Mother Box...

1155
02:15:57.787 --> 02:16:00.246
...turns smoke
back into a house.


1156
02:16:05.954 --> 02:16:08.746
I know we're all thinking
the same thing right now.


1157
02:16:09.912 --> 02:16:12.704
Who's gonna say it?
I'm not gonna say it.


1158
02:16:39.871 --> 02:16:41.079
Who is it?

1159
02:16:41.662 --> 02:16:42.954
Martha.

1160
02:16:47.621 --> 02:16:48.954
Hi.

1161
02:16:50.704 --> 02:16:52.204
Hi.

1162
02:17:01.162 --> 02:17:02.621
I went to the <i>Daily Planet</i>

1163
02:17:02.704 --> 02:17:06.371
to finally pick up
Clark's things.


1164
02:17:07.662 --> 02:17:11.162
I don't know why,
nowhere to put them now.


1165
02:17:13.829 --> 02:17:15.579
I lost the farm.

1166
02:17:16.954 --> 02:17:19.287
I'd been behind on
the payments for a while.


1167
02:17:20.496 --> 02:17:22.037
Truth is, the house is too big

1168
02:17:22.121 --> 02:17:24.746
for me to live in
by myself anyway.


1169
02:17:24.829 --> 02:17:27.829
Well, you know you're welcome
to stay here any time


1170
02:17:27.912 --> 02:17:30.037
for as long as you need.

1171
02:17:31.037 --> 02:17:33.871
Thank you, Lois.
That's very kind.


1172
02:17:35.246 --> 02:17:37.579
But I've found a little place
that suits me just fine,


1173
02:17:37.662 --> 02:17:39.662
right by the diner.

1174
02:17:39.746 --> 02:17:41.246
I'm not here for help.

1175
02:17:42.371 --> 02:17:44.787
I'm here because

1176
02:17:44.871 --> 02:17:47.579
when I saw Mr. Perry,
he told me that


1177
02:17:48.787 --> 02:17:51.954
you haven't been to work
since Clark died.


1178
02:17:56.662 --> 02:17:58.372
I can't.

1179
02:18:05.038 --> 02:18:07.788
The whole world is mourning.

1180
02:18:09.038 --> 02:18:11.372
Grieving over a symbol.

1181
02:18:11.455 --> 02:18:15.580
Everywhere I go, everywhere
I look, I see that "S."


1182
02:18:16.538 --> 02:18:18.622
I hear what people say.

1183
02:18:18.705 --> 02:18:20.705
They talk like they knew him.

1184
02:18:21.747 --> 02:18:24.205
But they didn't know Clark.

1185
02:18:25.580 --> 02:18:27.830
And I can't stop them

1186
02:18:27.913 --> 02:18:32.538
and look at them and tell them
how proud I am of my son.


1187
02:18:34.330 --> 02:18:36.997
You're the only one who knows.

1188
02:18:37.080 --> 02:18:39.622
Who feels what I do.

1189
02:18:40.747 --> 02:18:43.913
Burdened by a secret
on top of grief.


1190
02:18:46.788 --> 02:18:50.288
I came all this way
because I wanted...


1191
02:18:50.372 --> 02:18:52.538
because I wanted to see you.

1192
02:18:53.663 --> 02:18:55.705
Tell you...

1193
02:18:55.788 --> 02:18:57.747
I understand.

1194
02:18:59.622 --> 02:19:01.622
I...

1195
02:19:01.705 --> 02:19:05.622
will never love anybody
the way that I love your son.


1196
02:19:09.205 --> 02:19:11.372
And I just miss him.

1197
02:19:12.372 --> 02:19:14.997
I miss him so much.

1198
02:19:21.288 --> 02:19:23.122
So do I, sweetheart.

1199
02:19:27.538 --> 02:19:32.538
Martha, you know if there's
anything you need, I'm here.


1200
02:19:35.913 --> 02:19:38.747
There is something
you can do for me, honey.


1201
02:19:40.997 --> 02:19:43.413
Come back to the living.

1202
02:20:23.205 --> 02:20:26.247
The world
needs you, too, Lois.


1203
02:20:29.872 --> 02:20:31.288
<i>The dead are dead.</i>

1204
02:20:31.372 --> 02:20:33.288
The box brought Victor back.

1205
02:20:33.372 --> 02:20:34.955
Victor wasn't dead.

1206
02:20:35.038 --> 02:20:36.830
Life is either one or zero.

1207
02:20:36.913 --> 02:20:39.913
It's to be or not to be.
Not both.


1208
02:20:39.997 --> 02:20:41.663
Can you operate this box,
Victor?


1209
02:20:41.747 --> 02:20:43.038
Of course.

1210
02:20:43.122 --> 02:20:45.580
But we don't know enough
about Kryptonian biology.


1211
02:20:45.663 --> 02:20:47.747
There's no telling
what's gonna happen.


1212
02:20:49.455 --> 02:20:50.997
Okay, but...

1213
02:20:51.080 --> 02:20:55.372
I mean, we have to try.
Don't we? We have to try.


1214
02:20:55.455 --> 02:20:56.788
What do we have to lose?

1215
02:20:56.872 --> 02:20:59.330
We cannot try
unless we activate the box.


1216
02:20:59.413 --> 02:21:00.955
As soon as it wakes up...

1217
02:21:01.038 --> 02:21:03.455
...the enemy sees it, comes,

1218
02:21:03.538 --> 02:21:06.122
activates The Unity.
The end.


1219
02:21:06.205 --> 02:21:08.622
So, what we have to lose
is the entire planet


1220
02:21:08.705 --> 02:21:10.872
to a bunch of genocidal aliens.
That's good to know.


1221
02:21:10.955 --> 02:21:13.497
Even if Superman could return,

1222
02:21:13.580 --> 02:21:15.663
who's to say
that he could defeat them?


1223
02:21:15.747 --> 02:21:17.663
The Mother Box did.

1224
02:21:17.747 --> 02:21:19.997
Victor's father
activated a Mother Box


1225
02:21:20.080 --> 02:21:23.038
more than a year ago
when Superman was still alive.


1226
02:21:23.122 --> 02:21:24.997
Didn't call out
to Steppenwolf.


1227
02:21:25.080 --> 02:21:26.705
None of the boxes did.
Not until...


1228
02:21:26.788 --> 02:21:28.997
Not until Superman died.

1229
02:21:29.080 --> 02:21:31.455
Not until Superman died.

1230
02:21:31.538 --> 02:21:33.497
It's like they were
afraid of him?


1231
02:21:33.580 --> 02:21:36.663
Yes,
they were afraid of him.


1232
02:21:39.455 --> 02:21:41.413
This is the only way.

1233
02:21:42.747 --> 02:21:46.830
There are six, not five.
There is no us without him.


1234
02:22:02.956 --> 02:22:05.039
Cross this one off
the bucket list.


1235
02:22:05.123 --> 02:22:09.164
Exhume Superman
from the grave. Check.


1236
02:22:10.914 --> 02:22:13.623
You know we could do this
in a nanosecond, right?


1237
02:22:14.248 --> 02:22:15.706
We could.

1238
02:22:23.123 --> 02:22:24.873
He was my hero.

1239
02:22:27.373 --> 02:22:28.706
All right.

1240
02:22:32.164 --> 02:22:35.373
An Amazon
working with an Atlantean.


1241
02:22:35.456 --> 02:22:36.789
Half
-Atlantean.

1242
02:22:38.373 --> 02:22:41.748
How many thousands of years
since our people spoke?


1243
02:22:41.831 --> 02:22:45.873
I don't know.
I'm not exactly close to mine.


1244
02:22:45.956 --> 02:22:48.914
I hate Atlanteans as much
as you Amazons do.


1245
02:22:48.998 --> 02:22:51.123
Hate is useless.

1246
02:22:54.164 --> 02:22:55.539
Yep.

1247
02:22:56.748 --> 02:22:58.456
No, thank you.

1248
02:23:02.831 --> 02:23:03.956
You know, my father told me

1249
02:23:04.039 --> 02:23:05.956
there's a saying
in Atlantis...


1250
02:23:07.456 --> 02:23:09.789
"None are taken back
from the darkness.


1251
02:23:09.873 --> 02:23:10.998
"Not without..."

1252
02:23:11.081 --> 02:23:12.831
"Not without
giving one up in return."


1253
02:23:14.914 --> 02:23:16.623
We say the same thing.

1254
02:23:19.164 --> 02:23:20.914
How about that?

1255
02:23:20.998 --> 02:23:22.998
Wonder Woman.

1256
02:23:24.206 --> 02:23:25.498
What do you think, man?

1257
02:23:25.581 --> 02:23:28.456
You think she'd ever
go for a younger guy?


1258
02:23:28.539 --> 02:23:31.289
She's 5,000 years old, Barry.

1259
02:23:32.998 --> 02:23:34.998
Every guy's a younger guy.

1260
02:23:36.873 --> 02:23:37.956
Jesus.

1261
02:23:39.456 --> 02:23:41.289
Oh, Christ.

1262
02:23:43.623 --> 02:23:46.248
Oh, bloody...

1263
02:23:47.539 --> 02:23:48.539
Any luck?

1264
02:23:48.623 --> 02:23:49.956
If by "luck" you mean

1265
02:23:50.039 --> 02:23:53.081
"chance in hell
we'll get it flying today,"


1266
02:23:53.164 --> 02:23:55.331
then, no. No luck.

1267
02:23:56.081 --> 02:23:57.498
It's okay.

1268
02:23:57.581 --> 02:23:59.539
It doesn't matter.
We're just gonna take the body


1269
02:23:59.623 --> 02:24:00.789
to the Kryptonian ship.

1270
02:24:00.873 --> 02:24:02.206
It's basically
an organic computer.


1271
02:24:02.289 --> 02:24:03.998
It can talk directly
to the Mother Box.


1272
02:24:04.081 --> 02:24:06.706
What? The way it talked
to Lex Luthor?


1273
02:24:06.789 --> 02:24:08.164
Something like that.

1274
02:24:08.248 --> 02:24:12.039
Huh.
What could possibly go wrong?


1275
02:24:18.539 --> 02:24:20.164
Master Wayne...

1276
02:24:22.123 --> 02:24:23.498
you did it!

1277
02:24:23.581 --> 02:24:27.164
You put the team together
to fight this war.


1278
02:24:27.248 --> 02:24:30.414
You've fulfilled your promise.

1279
02:24:30.498 --> 02:24:34.414
But to try to do that...
I mean...


1280
02:24:34.498 --> 02:24:37.456
your guilt's
overcome your reason.


1281
02:24:37.539 --> 02:24:39.706
Not all the king's horses
nor all the king's men...


1282
02:24:39.789 --> 02:24:43.164
Alfred, for once,
I'm operating strictly on faith,


1283
02:24:43.248 --> 02:24:45.581
not on reason.

1284
02:24:45.664 --> 02:24:50.039
But if you start playing with
this little box of tricks,


1285
02:24:50.123 --> 02:24:52.248
I mean, it could be
the end of everything.


1286
02:24:52.331 --> 02:24:55.373
How do you know
your team's strong enough?


1287
02:24:55.456 --> 02:24:57.914
If you can't bring down
the charging bull,


1288
02:24:57.998 --> 02:24:59.831
then don't wave
the red cape at it.


1289
02:24:59.914 --> 02:25:01.623
You do
when it's this red cape.


1290
02:25:01.706 --> 02:25:04.039
This red cape charges back.

1291
02:25:18.664 --> 02:25:19.956
Okay.

1292
02:25:26.581 --> 02:25:29.164
You were right, Dr. Stone.
The tests came back negative.


1293
02:25:29.248 --> 02:25:30.873
Everyone's clear,
including you.


1294
02:25:30.956 --> 02:25:33.623
Just to be on the safe side,
we swept the entire facility.


1295
02:25:33.706 --> 02:25:35.539
Well, thank you, Thomas.
That means I'm free to go?


1296
02:25:35.623 --> 02:25:36.748
Absolutely.

1297
02:25:40.539 --> 02:25:41.873
- Thanks.
- Listen up, everyone.


1298
02:25:41.956 --> 02:25:44.499
You're all clear.
So, gather your things.


1299
02:25:44.582 --> 02:25:46.207
If you need
more medical attention...


1300
02:25:46.290 --> 02:25:50.082
Arthur, yes, your opinion.
Less preposterous. Option "A"?


1301
02:25:50.165 --> 02:25:51.582
- Definitely not "A."
- Okay.


1302
02:25:51.665 --> 02:25:54.915
Or... "B"?

1303
02:25:56.374 --> 02:25:57.790
Let me see "A" again?

1304
02:26:03.249 --> 02:26:06.582
Right. We should get dressed.

1305
02:26:08.540 --> 02:26:10.665
I'm always dressed.

1306
02:26:37.665 --> 02:26:38.874
ID?

1307
02:26:38.957 --> 02:26:40.207
ID.

1308
02:26:43.332 --> 02:26:44.540
Aye, aye.

1309
02:26:46.749 --> 02:26:48.082
"Aye, aye"?

1310
02:27:11.165 --> 02:27:12.540
Okay.

1311
02:27:12.624 --> 02:27:14.832
"Okay"? Oh, gee, okay!

1312
02:27:21.749 --> 02:27:22.790
Doc!

1313
02:27:22.874 --> 02:27:24.207
They let you out
of quarantine.


1314
02:27:24.290 --> 02:27:25.874
Yeah, I finally got them
to listen to reason.


1315
02:27:25.957 --> 02:27:28.082
Now, let's take a look and see
what progress we've made


1316
02:27:28.165 --> 02:27:29.457
with the electron-laser.

1317
02:27:29.540 --> 02:27:31.832
We've made some real progress.
Let me show you.


1318
02:27:46.790 --> 02:27:49.624
Victor, clear this place out.

1319
02:27:49.707 --> 02:27:51.165
Done.

1320
02:27:54.957 --> 02:27:57.624
<i>Code Red.
Contamination breach.</i>


1321
02:27:57.707 --> 02:28:01.040
<i>All personnel
evacuate immediately.</i>


1322
02:28:01.124 --> 02:28:03.332
Bio red five.

1323
02:28:03.415 --> 02:28:05.915
The sensor's picking up
a microbe of alien origin.


1324
02:28:05.999 --> 02:28:08.790
A microbe of alien origin?
That doesn't make any sense.


1325
02:28:08.874 --> 02:28:10.249
It's gotta be a false alarm.

1326
02:28:10.332 --> 02:28:12.332
All right, people,
shut it down. Let's go.


1327
02:28:12.415 --> 02:28:13.874
- Ryan, we just had it swept.
- We have to go, Doc.


1328
02:28:13.957 --> 02:28:15.290
Think about it.
It's gotta be a false alarm.


1329
02:28:15.374 --> 02:28:16.749
- Let's go, Doc.
- Think about it.


1330
02:28:16.832 --> 02:28:17.832
Full base evacuation!
Everyone out!


1331
02:28:17.915 --> 02:28:20.040
Look, wait! Wait! Shit!

1332
02:28:20.124 --> 02:28:23.082
<i>Remain calm and
proceed to the nearest exit.</i>


1333
02:28:29.499 --> 02:28:31.249
<i>Attention, all personnel.</i>

1334
02:28:31.332 --> 02:28:34.290
Go! Go! Everybody out!
Come on! Move!


1335
02:28:34.374 --> 02:28:36.082
Move! Come on! Go, go!

1336
02:28:36.165 --> 02:28:37.832
Everybody out! Go!

1337
02:28:58.040 --> 02:29:00.832
Yes! Gotcha!

1338
02:29:00.915 --> 02:29:03.665
Post Commander, this is
Dr. Silas Stone, do you read?


1339
02:29:03.749 --> 02:29:06.290
- <i>Go ahead, Dr. Stone.</i>
- This is a false alarm.


1340
02:29:06.374 --> 02:29:09.124
Someone has hacked into
the system. We must alert...


1341
02:29:19.082 --> 02:29:20.582
Victor.

1342
02:29:22.040 --> 02:29:24.540
<i>Dr. Stone, you there?
I don't copy.</i>


1343
02:29:25.457 --> 02:29:26.499
I was mistaken.

1344
02:29:26.582 --> 02:29:27.790
The alarm's legit.

1345
02:29:27.874 --> 02:29:29.582
Everybody out.
And nobody, I repeat,


1346
02:29:29.665 --> 02:29:32.582
nobody comes back inside
without my say-so.


1347
02:29:32.665 --> 02:29:34.040
<i>Roger that, sir.</i>

1348
02:29:44.083 --> 02:29:45.791
Get the civilians out!

1349
02:29:45.875 --> 02:29:47.083
Let's go! Let's go!

1350
02:29:51.250 --> 02:29:52.625
- Everybody got out okay?
- I think so.


1351
02:29:52.708 --> 02:29:53.875
- Everybody?
- Yes.


1352
02:30:27.125 --> 02:30:28.458
This way.

1353
02:30:38.875 --> 02:30:41.833
It knows he's here.

1354
02:30:41.916 --> 02:30:44.125
Ooh, that's intense.

1355
02:30:48.500 --> 02:30:50.500
This is amazing.

1356
02:30:51.208 --> 02:30:52.500
This is crazy.

1357
02:30:52.583 --> 02:30:54.416
Oh, what? Now it's crazy?

1358
02:30:54.500 --> 02:30:57.166
You two lunatics
better know what you're doing.


1359
02:33:22.916 --> 02:33:24.958
<i>Systems coming online.</i>

1360
02:33:27.666 --> 02:33:30.001
<i>Welcome, Victor.</i>

1361
02:33:30.084 --> 02:33:31.959
<i>Would you like
to assume command?</i>


1362
02:33:32.042 --> 02:33:33.126
I'm in.

1363
02:33:42.334 --> 02:33:44.584
The ship says
the Mother Box is hostile.


1364
02:33:44.667 --> 02:33:46.417
I can override
the security protocols,


1365
02:33:46.501 --> 02:33:48.251
but there's no time to repair
all the electrical damage


1366
02:33:48.334 --> 02:33:49.709
that Luthor's
power surges caused


1367
02:33:49.792 --> 02:33:50.876
to the primary capacitors.

1368
02:33:50.959 --> 02:33:52.084
English.

1369
02:33:52.167 --> 02:33:54.584
There's not enough charge
to wake the box.


1370
02:33:54.667 --> 02:33:56.792
I might be able to do it.

1371
02:33:58.834 --> 02:34:00.917
I mean, I might be able
to jump-start it.


1372
02:34:01.001 --> 02:34:02.292
I don't like
to break this rule,


1373
02:34:02.376 --> 02:34:04.167
but when I approach
the speed of light, I...


1374
02:34:04.251 --> 02:34:05.792
Look, crazy things
happen to time,


1375
02:34:05.876 --> 02:34:08.542
but if I do it, I create
massive electrical power.


1376
02:34:08.626 --> 02:34:10.459
I could backtrack,
if I can get enough distance,


1377
02:34:10.542 --> 02:34:12.792
I can conduct a significant
electrical current.


1378
02:34:12.876 --> 02:34:15.667
I might be able to wake
the box, if that's...


1379
02:34:15.751 --> 02:34:17.459
still what we want?

1380
02:34:17.542 --> 02:34:19.042
It is. Do it.

1381
02:34:23.792 --> 02:34:25.084
Hey, Miss Lane.

1382
02:34:25.167 --> 02:34:26.126
Morning.

1383
02:34:26.209 --> 02:34:27.584
I didn't think
you were coming.


1384
02:34:28.542 --> 02:34:30.209
One last time.

1385
02:34:47.001 --> 02:34:50.959
I see engines, so this must be
the end of the line. So I'm...


1386
02:34:51.042 --> 02:34:52.126
<i>I'm in position.</i>

1387
02:34:54.876 --> 02:34:57.459
<i>Ready to initiate
drop sequence.</i>


1388
02:34:57.542 --> 02:34:59.292
The Mother Box is ready.

1389
02:35:18.542 --> 02:35:20.417
The ship's begging me
not to wake the box.


1390
02:35:20.501 --> 02:35:22.292
<i>This action
is irreversible.</i>


1391
02:35:22.376 --> 02:35:23.792
It's afraid.
It knows Steppenwolf will come for it.


1392
02:35:23.876 --> 02:35:25.751
We know that already.
Continue.


1393
02:35:25.834 --> 02:35:28.459
<i>I strongly advise
against activation.</i>


1394
02:35:28.542 --> 02:35:30.126
Barry, I'm initiating
the countdown.


1395
02:35:30.209 --> 02:35:31.959
<i>This action
is irreversible.</i>


1396
02:35:32.042 --> 02:35:33.209
- Five...
- <i>Five...</i>


1397
02:35:33.292 --> 02:35:34.584
- Five...
- <i>Apokoliptian technology</i>


1398
02:35:34.667 --> 02:35:35.792
- <i>is hostile.</i>
- This is a bad idea.


1399
02:35:35.876 --> 02:35:36.667
No, it isn't.
Keep going.


1400
02:35:36.751 --> 02:35:37.751
Four...

1401
02:35:37.834 --> 02:35:39.417
- <i>Four...</i>
- Four...


1402
02:35:39.501 --> 02:35:40.876
<i>I strongly advise
against activation.</i>


1403
02:35:40.959 --> 02:35:42.334
- We need to abort, now.
- Just do it.


1404
02:35:42.417 --> 02:35:43.584
- Three...
- <i>Three...</i>


1405
02:35:43.667 --> 02:35:44.584
Three...

1406
02:35:44.667 --> 02:35:46.542
- Two...
- <i>Two...</i>


1407
02:35:46.626 --> 02:35:48.417
- Two...
- <i>This course is irreversible.</i>


1408
02:35:48.501 --> 02:35:49.876
- One.
- <i>One.</i>


1409
02:35:50.876 --> 02:35:52.167
One.

1410
02:35:52.251 --> 02:35:53.584
<i>This action
is irreversible.</i>


1411
02:37:22.668 --> 02:37:24.210
- <i>Victor?</i>
- No.


1412
02:37:25.043 --> 02:37:26.127
Go?

1413
02:38:56.627 --> 02:38:59.543
<i>The future
has taken root in the present.</i>


1414
02:38:59.627 --> 02:39:01.418
Get down!

1415
02:40:45.460 --> 02:40:47.127
He's back.

1416
02:41:13.835 --> 02:41:16.794
Something's wrong.
He's scanning us.


1417
02:41:18.919 --> 02:41:20.378
What?

1418
02:41:35.294 --> 02:41:36.419
Victor?

1419
02:41:37.628 --> 02:41:38.711
Victor?

1420
02:41:40.794 --> 02:41:42.711
- Shit.
- What are you doing?


1421
02:41:42.794 --> 02:41:44.503
It's my auto-defense system.

1422
02:41:44.586 --> 02:41:45.711
It senses danger.

1423
02:41:45.794 --> 02:41:47.044
Victor, no! Victor!

1424
02:41:47.128 --> 02:41:49.086
- I can't control it.
- Don't!


1425
02:42:01.419 --> 02:42:02.711
Kal
-El, no!

1426
02:42:10.836 --> 02:42:13.003
He's confused.
He doesn't know who he is.


1427
02:42:20.003 --> 02:42:22.836
Arthur,
we need to restrain him.


1428
02:42:53.169 --> 02:42:57.044
Kal-El,
the last Son of Krypton...


1429
02:42:57.961 --> 02:43:00.294
remember who you are.

1430
02:43:01.836 --> 02:43:03.128
Tell me who you...

1431
02:44:38.003 --> 02:44:41.211
Let's go!

1432
02:44:48.336 --> 02:44:49.836
You should probably move.

1433
02:44:53.169 --> 02:44:54.378
- You all right?
- Yeah.


1434
02:44:54.461 --> 02:44:57.336
Get up.
Take cover back there. Go.


1435
02:45:49.212 --> 02:45:51.420
Please don't make me do this.

1436
02:46:24.087 --> 02:46:25.295
Clark.

1437
02:46:26.254 --> 02:46:27.545
Clark, no.

1438
02:46:39.004 --> 02:46:40.337
Clark.

1439
02:46:40.420 --> 02:46:42.254
No.

1440
02:46:42.337 --> 02:46:44.212
This world needs you.

1441
02:46:49.337 --> 02:46:50.670
Clark.

1442
02:46:50.754 --> 02:46:51.962
Clark.

1443
02:46:52.045 --> 02:46:54.087
Whoa! Hold your fire!
Hold your fire!


1444
02:46:55.712 --> 02:46:56.920
Clark.

1445
02:47:00.254 --> 02:47:01.712
Please.

1446
02:47:35.837 --> 02:47:37.087
Please.

1447
02:47:48.170 --> 02:47:49.420
Please.

1448
02:47:50.129 --> 02:47:52.295
Just go.

1449
02:47:52.379 --> 02:47:53.462
Yeah.

1450
02:47:54.254 --> 02:47:55.629
Let's go.

1451
02:48:28.087 --> 02:48:30.379
I'm so sorry.

1452
02:48:39.629 --> 02:48:40.629
Take cover!

1453
02:48:40.712 --> 02:48:43.295
- He's coming.
- The Mother Box.


1454
02:48:43.379 --> 02:48:44.545
Where is it?

1455
02:48:55.087 --> 02:48:56.420
Come on.

1456
02:48:57.295 --> 02:48:59.170
Come on.

1457
02:49:23.796 --> 02:49:27.546
<i>Attention,
security breach detected.</i>


1458
02:49:27.630 --> 02:49:29.796
<i>Sector Four, 
Level Three.</i>

1459
02:49:29.880 --> 02:49:32.963
<i>Implement lockdown
procedures immediately.</i>


1460
02:50:01.380 --> 02:50:03.088
Give me the Mother Box.

1461
02:50:16.171 --> 02:50:17.713
No, no, no.

1462
02:50:20.171 --> 02:50:22.005
Dad, wait! Don't!

1463
02:51:02.213 --> 02:51:05.213
So begins the end.

1464
02:51:10.796 --> 02:51:12.255
Victor?

1465
02:51:14.505 --> 02:51:17.921
Vic... Whoa, Victor.
Are you okay, man? Come on.


1466
02:51:23.838 --> 02:51:25.088
Victor?

1467
02:51:26.088 --> 02:51:27.630
He's dead.

1468
02:51:27.713 --> 02:51:28.838
What?

1469
02:51:29.796 --> 02:51:31.130
My father.

1470
02:51:32.380 --> 02:51:36.088
I didn't save him. I couldn't.

1471
02:51:36.171 --> 02:51:37.630
Oh, my God.

1472
02:51:44.380 --> 02:51:46.505
His father's dead
'cause of us.


1473
02:51:46.588 --> 02:51:48.213
I told you waking that box
was a bad idea.


1474
02:51:48.296 --> 02:51:49.880
It wasn't a bad idea.

1475
02:51:49.963 --> 02:51:52.338
We needed Superman.
We still do.


1476
02:51:52.421 --> 02:51:54.838
Well, whatever
returned, it isn't Superman.


1477
02:51:54.921 --> 02:51:58.088
His body and powers, maybe.
But it ain't him.


1478
02:51:58.171 --> 02:51:59.880
It is him.

1479
02:51:59.963 --> 02:52:02.338
He recognized Lois Lane.

1480
02:52:02.421 --> 02:52:04.588
- Who?
- The woman he loves.


1481
02:52:04.671 --> 02:52:07.088
- He remembers her.
- Nah.


1482
02:52:07.171 --> 02:52:09.130
He went to her 'cause
she wasn't afraid of him.


1483
02:52:09.213 --> 02:52:10.796
It's called instinct, Diana.

1484
02:52:17.963 --> 02:52:19.838
Wait,
where did Steppenwolf go?


1485
02:52:19.921 --> 02:52:21.630
He's gone back to his base

1486
02:52:21.713 --> 02:52:23.338
to assemble the three boxes.

1487
02:52:23.421 --> 02:52:24.963
And we don't know
where his base is.


1488
02:52:25.046 --> 02:52:26.671
- Or how long until...
- Hours.


1489
02:52:26.755 --> 02:52:28.421
The boxes synchronize,
Unity forms,


1490
02:52:28.505 --> 02:52:31.713
we don't get there in time
to stop it, the planet dies.


1491
02:52:31.796 --> 02:52:34.046
This is not your...

1492
02:52:36.130 --> 02:52:37.713
He knew.

1493
02:52:37.796 --> 02:52:39.421
He knew, he knew, he knew.

1494
02:52:39.505 --> 02:52:41.296
He wasn't trying
to destroy the box...


1495
02:52:41.380 --> 02:52:43.380
he was trying to superheat it.

1496
02:52:43.463 --> 02:52:44.796
He made the core
the hottest thing


1497
02:52:44.880 --> 02:52:46.130
on Earth outside
of a nuclear reactor.


1498
02:52:46.213 --> 02:52:47.296
Now, anything that hot
would have to...


1499
02:52:47.380 --> 02:52:48.421
Blink off the charts

1500
02:52:48.505 --> 02:52:50.713
on a thermal imaging system.

1501
02:52:50.796 --> 02:52:54.213
Your father sacrificed himself
to mark that box.


1502
02:52:54.297 --> 02:52:56.339
We have to get back to my lab
and use the satellite


1503
02:52:56.422 --> 02:52:58.631
to scan the Earth
for thermal anomalies.


1504
02:52:58.714 --> 02:53:00.006
I'm already on it.

1505
02:53:00.089 --> 02:53:02.089
I'm sorry.
You have a satellite?


1506
02:53:02.172 --> 02:53:03.631
I have six.

1507
02:53:03.714 --> 02:53:04.839
Right.

1508
02:53:06.422 --> 02:53:08.672
Let's go find
the son of a bitch.


1509
02:53:33.047 --> 02:53:35.256
You brought us here.

1510
02:53:35.339 --> 02:53:36.631
You remembered.

1511
02:53:37.422 --> 02:53:39.172
This is home.

1512
02:53:41.006 --> 02:53:42.297
You spoke.

1513
02:53:46.214 --> 02:53:48.214
Did I not before?

1514
02:54:21.964 --> 02:54:24.756
Your mother got behind
on the payments.


1515
02:54:26.089 --> 02:54:28.256
She never told anyone.

1516
02:54:29.797 --> 02:54:31.714
I don't understand.

1517
02:54:34.589 --> 02:54:37.214
She's a proud woman, Clark.

1518
02:54:40.256 --> 02:54:41.714
Here.

1519
02:54:56.464 --> 02:54:58.297
She loved it here.

1520
02:55:09.006 --> 02:55:10.714
So did I.

1521
02:55:12.631 --> 02:55:14.172
So did I.

1522
02:55:39.672 --> 02:55:41.047
Wow!

1523
02:55:41.131 --> 02:55:42.756
This is awesome.

1524
02:55:42.839 --> 02:55:44.547
Brought some friends.

1525
02:55:50.964 --> 02:55:53.547
Oh, gosh, yes! Yes!

1526
02:55:53.631 --> 02:55:56.297
Everyone, this is Alfred.
I work for him.


1527
02:55:56.381 --> 02:55:58.756
- Alfred.
- Good day, ma'am.


1528
02:55:59.922 --> 02:56:02.131
Oh...

1529
02:56:05.047 --> 02:56:07.089
It's badass, Alfred.

1530
02:56:09.672 --> 02:56:12.256
Well, I'll put on the tea.

1531
02:56:12.339 --> 02:56:13.631
Great.

1532
02:56:13.714 --> 02:56:15.464
I don't know where
we're gonna find the cups.


1533
02:56:18.131 --> 02:56:21.047
There's the
Mother Box, right there.


1534
02:56:21.131 --> 02:56:23.172
Go to visible spectrum.

1535
02:56:25.047 --> 02:56:27.131
Pozharnov.

1536
02:56:27.214 --> 02:56:30.214
Ghost city
not far from Moscow.


1537
02:56:30.297 --> 02:56:31.589
It's been abandoned since

1538
02:56:31.672 --> 02:56:33.047
the nuclear accident there

1539
02:56:33.131 --> 02:56:34.464
Not even the army goes in.

1540
02:56:34.547 --> 02:56:35.964
Right, it's probably
so radioactive


1541
02:56:36.047 --> 02:56:38.214
that you grow an extra foot
outta your neck.


1542
02:56:38.297 --> 02:56:39.631
Not anymore.

1543
02:56:39.714 --> 02:56:41.422
He's harvested the radiation
to build his base.


1544
02:56:41.506 --> 02:56:42.506
Zoom.

1545
02:56:46.464 --> 02:56:47.965
What the hell is he building?

1546
02:56:48.048 --> 02:56:49.382
The Unity's in there.

1547
02:56:49.465 --> 02:56:50.882
We'll attack from above.

1548
02:56:50.965 --> 02:56:53.673
Explosives won't
separate the boxes,


1549
02:56:53.757 --> 02:56:55.632
only strengthen their bond.

1550
02:56:55.715 --> 02:56:56.965
What?
So we can't blow it up?


1551
02:56:57.048 --> 02:56:58.715
Not from the outside.

1552
02:57:00.048 --> 02:57:03.173
I want to plug into
The Unity, one-on-one.


1553
02:57:03.257 --> 02:57:04.632
Fuse with it.

1554
02:57:04.715 --> 02:57:06.007
Weaken its bond
from the inside


1555
02:57:06.090 --> 02:57:07.465
so we can break it back
into three.


1556
02:57:07.548 --> 02:57:09.632
No, you don't know
what you'd be up against.


1557
02:57:09.715 --> 02:57:13.382
You'd have to stream
into The Unity by yourself.


1558
02:57:13.465 --> 02:57:16.007
These boxes together
are world destroyers.


1559
02:57:16.090 --> 02:57:17.507
A billion years old.

1560
02:57:17.590 --> 02:57:19.798
They'll get inside you
and find your weaknesses


1561
02:57:19.882 --> 02:57:22.215
and your fears,
and use them to destroy you.


1562
02:57:22.298 --> 02:57:24.507
Just get me in
and get me time.


1563
02:57:24.590 --> 02:57:25.757
You could die, Victor.

1564
02:57:25.840 --> 02:57:28.382
If I don't, we all die.
Period.


1565
02:57:32.965 --> 02:57:34.882
I got nothing left.

1566
02:57:39.965 --> 02:57:42.215
You wanted me
to use these gifts, right?


1567
02:57:45.132 --> 02:57:46.715
That's what I'm gonna do.

1568
02:57:46.798 --> 02:57:49.215
Okay. So...

1569
02:57:49.298 --> 02:57:50.965
if Victor wants
to try to save the world


1570
02:57:51.048 --> 02:57:52.673
by fusing
with the doom boxes,


1571
02:57:52.757 --> 02:57:55.132
I say we put him
in the doom boxes.


1572
02:57:55.215 --> 02:57:58.173
But getting him in
means attacking that base.


1573
02:57:58.257 --> 02:58:00.715
Fighting the devil
and his army


1574
02:58:00.798 --> 02:58:02.048
in hell.

1575
02:58:02.132 --> 02:58:04.132
I mean,
this guy's probably fought


1576
02:58:04.215 --> 02:58:06.548
hundreds of thousands
of other superbeings


1577
02:58:06.632 --> 02:58:08.340
on the other planets
he's destroyed, right?


1578
02:58:08.423 --> 02:58:09.965
And we have to assume
he's won.


1579
02:58:10.048 --> 02:58:11.798
I don't care
how many demons he's fought


1580
02:58:11.882 --> 02:58:13.257
in how many hells...

1581
02:58:13.340 --> 02:58:17.090
he's never fought us.
Not us united.


1582
02:59:07.382 --> 02:59:09.090
Take that as a "yes."

1583
02:59:09.173 --> 02:59:10.632
What?

1584
02:59:14.007 --> 02:59:15.298
The ring.

1585
02:59:18.882 --> 02:59:20.590
You're really back.

1586
02:59:53.882 --> 02:59:56.298
I have a second chance, Lo.

1587
02:59:58.382 --> 03:00:01.048
And I am not gonna waste it.

1588
03:00:59.174 --> 03:01:00.424
Are you really you?

1589
03:01:00.508 --> 03:01:02.883
I'm really me, Ma.

1590
03:01:20.258 --> 03:01:22.424
Listen, Ma.

1591
03:01:23.758 --> 03:01:26.049
They wanted me back
for a reason.


1592
03:01:27.674 --> 03:01:29.383
I need to find out why.

1593
03:01:49.341 --> 03:01:50.924
How's Victor doing?

1594
03:01:55.091 --> 03:01:58.049
You know,
wanted to be by himself.


1595
03:01:59.383 --> 03:02:02.591
We're asking a kid
who just lost his father


1596
03:02:02.674 --> 03:02:04.341
to go up against
the most powerful machines


1597
03:02:04.424 --> 03:02:05.758
in the universe.

1598
03:02:07.466 --> 03:02:09.133
It's not fair.

1599
03:02:10.716 --> 03:02:12.508
I thought you didn't care?

1600
03:02:13.758 --> 03:02:15.424
I never said that.

1601
03:02:28.216 --> 03:02:29.758
What is it?

1602
03:02:31.466 --> 03:02:33.341
Uh...

1603
03:02:33.424 --> 03:02:36.633
I had a dream,
like, I don't know,


1604
03:02:36.716 --> 03:02:39.341
almost like a premonition.

1605
03:02:39.424 --> 03:02:42.299
It was the end of the world

1606
03:02:42.383 --> 03:02:45.216
and Barry Allen
was right here


1607
03:02:45.299 --> 03:02:49.466
and he said to me,
"Lois Lane is the key."


1608
03:02:52.008 --> 03:02:55.383
She is... to Superman.

1609
03:02:56.258 --> 03:02:58.383
Every heart has one.

1610
03:02:58.466 --> 03:03:00.549
I think it's something more.

1611
03:03:01.299 --> 03:03:03.299
Something darker.

1612
03:03:07.341 --> 03:03:08.424
Master Wayne.

1613
03:03:08.508 --> 03:03:10.716
Master Wayne!

1614
03:03:10.799 --> 03:03:12.633
You need to see this.

1615
03:03:35.799 --> 03:03:37.591
You fixed it.

1616
03:03:37.674 --> 03:03:39.508
It wanted to fly.

1617
03:03:40.633 --> 03:03:42.049
Flight is its nature.

1618
03:03:42.133 --> 03:03:43.549
Yours, too.

1619
03:03:50.133 --> 03:03:52.216
He'll be here, Alfred,
I know it.


1620
03:03:52.299 --> 03:03:54.591
What makes you so sure?

1621
03:03:54.674 --> 03:03:57.424
Faith, Alfred. Faith.

1622
03:04:19.466 --> 03:04:21.133
At last.

1623
03:04:22.841 --> 03:04:25.674
Prepare for his arrival.

1624
03:04:27.341 --> 03:04:31.633
My redemption is nigh.

1625
03:04:39.425 --> 03:04:40.967
Unite.

1626
03:04:46.009 --> 03:04:48.634
Synchronize.

1627
03:05:32.717 --> 03:05:34.050
The satellites revealed

1628
03:05:34.134 --> 03:05:35.800
he's created a defensive dome.

1629
03:05:35.884 --> 03:05:37.134
It's a design flaw.

1630
03:05:37.217 --> 03:05:39.467
Take out the tower,
the dome will fall.


1631
03:05:39.550 --> 03:05:41.634
The enemy never anticipated
a frontal assault.


1632
03:05:41.717 --> 03:05:43.342
Right, probably
'cause he didn't think


1633
03:05:43.425 --> 03:05:45.509
anyone would be that nuts.

1634
03:05:46.384 --> 03:05:47.634
Bruce is right.

1635
03:05:47.717 --> 03:05:49.342
We've got to destroy
the defensive dome


1636
03:05:49.425 --> 03:05:51.842
so we can reach The Unity
before it synchronizes.


1637
03:05:51.925 --> 03:05:53.842
What if the dome's
not destroyed?


1638
03:05:53.925 --> 03:05:55.259
It'll be destroyed.

1639
03:05:55.342 --> 03:05:57.134
Once Victor
is linked with The Unity


1640
03:05:57.217 --> 03:05:58.509
with Barry's help,

1641
03:05:58.592 --> 03:06:00.425
he'll break through
The Unity's defenses.


1642
03:06:00.509 --> 03:06:02.134
Remind me,
how's that again?


1643
03:06:02.217 --> 03:06:03.675
Uh, with the power of love.

1644
03:06:03.759 --> 03:06:06.800
- Barry.
- With a catastrophic energy surge.


1645
03:06:06.884 --> 03:06:08.217
Good.

1646
03:06:08.300 --> 03:06:10.092
You'll have to run faster
than you've ever attempted


1647
03:06:10.175 --> 03:06:12.509
to generate
a charge of that size.


1648
03:06:12.592 --> 03:06:14.842
And then you make
physical contact with Victor.


1649
03:06:14.925 --> 03:06:17.925
That force should propel him
inside The Unity.


1650
03:06:18.009 --> 03:06:19.925
And, Victor,
it's all up to you.


1651
03:06:20.009 --> 03:06:23.384
Take it apart from the inside
before it synchronizes.


1652
03:06:23.467 --> 03:06:27.092
Whew. We actually
finally have a plan.


1653
03:06:27.175 --> 03:06:29.050
We have a plan.

1654
03:06:44.092 --> 03:06:46.175
<i>The symbol
of the house of El means hope.</i>


1655
03:06:46.259 --> 03:06:48.509
<i>Embodied within that hope
is the fundamental belief</i>


1656
03:06:48.592 --> 03:06:52.550
<i>in the potential of every
person to be a force for good.</i>


1657
03:06:52.634 --> 03:06:54.050
<i>Clark...</i>

1658
03:06:54.134 --> 03:06:55.717
<i>That's what
you can bring them.</i>


1659
03:06:55.800 --> 03:06:57.384
<i>...you were
sent here for a reason.</i>


1660
03:06:57.467 --> 03:06:59.092
<i>You will give
the people of Earth</i>


1661
03:06:59.175 --> 03:07:01.259
<i>an ideal to strive towards.</i>

1662
03:07:01.342 --> 03:07:02.509
<i>And even if it takes you</i>

1663
03:07:02.592 --> 03:07:04.259
<i>the rest of your life,</i>

1664
03:07:04.342 --> 03:07:07.509
<i>you owe it to yourself to
find out what that reason is.</i>


1665
03:07:07.592 --> 03:07:10.259
<i>They will stumble,
they will fall.</i>


1666
03:07:10.342 --> 03:07:12.425
<i>You're gonna
have to make a choice.</i>


1667
03:07:12.509 --> 03:07:14.967
<i>They will join you
in the sun, Kal.</i>


1668
03:07:15.050 --> 03:07:17.050
<i>A choice
of whether to stand proud</i>


1669
03:07:17.134 --> 03:07:19.092
<i>in front of the human race
or not.</i>


1670
03:07:19.175 --> 03:07:22.675
<i>You will help them
accomplish wonders.</i>


1671
03:07:39.467 --> 03:07:44.134
<i>All the hopes and dreams
of Krypton live in you now.</i>


1672
03:07:44.217 --> 03:07:47.717
<i>I'm so proud of you, son.</i>

1673
03:07:47.800 --> 03:07:50.467
<i>Your mother and I
loved you.</i>


1674
03:07:50.550 --> 03:07:52.050
<i>Your mother and I knew</i>

1675
03:07:52.134 --> 03:07:54.342
<i>you would change the world.</i>

1676
03:07:55.425 --> 03:07:58.384
<i>Your heart was tested.</i>

1677
03:07:58.467 --> 03:08:01.092
<i>I know
it's been hard, Clark.</i>


1678
03:08:01.175 --> 03:08:04.134
<i>But you gave hope
to their world.</i>


1679
03:08:04.217 --> 03:08:07.675
<i>You need
to show them who you are.</i>


1680
03:08:07.759 --> 03:08:09.967
<i>Love them, Kal.</i>

1681
03:08:10.050 --> 03:08:12.384
<i>The way we loved you.</i>

1682
03:08:14.675 --> 03:08:15.967
<i>Fly, son.</i>

1683
03:08:16.884 --> 03:08:18.217
<i>It's time.</i>

1684
03:09:21.801 --> 03:09:23.218
I'm gonna take out that tower

1685
03:09:23.301 --> 03:09:25.093
and knock down
that shield dome.


1686
03:09:25.176 --> 03:09:26.426
Whatever you see,

1687
03:09:27.635 --> 03:09:29.718
stick to the plan.

1688
03:09:31.385 --> 03:09:33.510
It's why
I brought you together.


1689
03:10:13.343 --> 03:10:15.343
Bruce, pull back.
You're not gonna make it.


1690
03:10:18.176 --> 03:10:21.176
Just have to knock
a little louder.


1691
03:10:46.051 --> 03:10:47.593
Kill him!

1692
03:10:47.676 --> 03:10:50.676
Get to the carriage.
Defend The Unity.


1693
03:10:55.468 --> 03:10:56.718
Oh, shit.

1694
03:11:16.801 --> 03:11:18.135
The tower's down.

1695
03:11:19.635 --> 03:11:21.551
Do you read me?

1696
03:11:21.635 --> 03:11:22.926
Uh, yeah, loud and clear.

1697
03:11:23.801 --> 03:11:25.385
<i>Are you okay?</i>

1698
03:11:26.468 --> 03:11:29.260
<i>Bruce? Bruce?</i>

1699
03:11:29.343 --> 03:11:30.426
Get to the reactor.

1700
03:11:30.510 --> 03:11:31.843
I'll lure as many
of these monsters


1701
03:11:31.926 --> 03:11:34.051
- away from you as I can.
- What does that mean?


1702
03:11:36.801 --> 03:11:38.801
Don't worry about me.
Get to The Unity.


1703
03:11:41.593 --> 03:11:42.635
They're here.

1704
03:11:42.718 --> 03:11:44.010
<i>Bruce?</i>

1705
03:11:46.926 --> 03:11:48.385
Comm went dead.

1706
03:11:50.010 --> 03:11:51.343
Let's go.

1707
03:12:30.011 --> 03:12:32.094
Come on, follow me,
you damn insects.


1708
03:13:51.802 --> 03:13:53.219
<i>Critical damage.</i>

1709
03:14:33.011 --> 03:14:34.469
You really are
outta your mind.


1710
03:15:01.261 --> 03:15:02.511
You're welcome.

1711
03:15:02.594 --> 03:15:04.219
My man.

1712
03:16:36.887 --> 03:16:38.595
Yeah, we got this.

1713
03:16:38.678 --> 03:16:40.095
You go do your thing.

1714
03:17:35.887 --> 03:17:37.553
I'm assuming you're Alfred.

1715
03:17:39.303 --> 03:17:40.720
Master Kent.

1716
03:17:42.637 --> 03:17:44.262
He said you'd come.

1717
03:17:45.720 --> 03:17:49.387
Now, let's hope
you're not too late.


1718
03:18:00.012 --> 03:18:02.512
Hey!

1719
03:18:10.512 --> 03:18:11.970
Remember me?

1720
03:18:14.387 --> 03:18:15.928
Round two?

1721
03:18:16.512 --> 03:18:17.803
Hell yeah.

1722
03:18:39.178 --> 03:18:40.678
Shall we?

1723
03:18:41.512 --> 03:18:43.762
Tell me, Amazon,

1724
03:18:43.845 --> 03:18:47.928
why did you
abandon your own sisters


1725
03:18:48.012 --> 03:18:50.678
only to cast your lot
with these creatures


1726
03:18:50.762 --> 03:18:54.095
clinging to their puny lives?

1727
03:18:54.178 --> 03:18:57.262
You weren't there
to protect them from me.


1728
03:18:57.345 --> 03:18:59.470
And, sadly, you could have.

1729
03:19:40.345 --> 03:19:42.220
Barry, I'm in position.

1730
03:20:00.762 --> 03:20:04.053
Okay.
I built the charge.


1731
03:20:04.137 --> 03:20:05.303
<i>You call it.</i>

1732
03:20:06.429 --> 03:20:08.263
Barry, on one.

1733
03:20:08.346 --> 03:20:10.638
Three, two...

1734
03:20:13.471 --> 03:20:15.346
Get the hell off me!

1735
03:20:15.429 --> 03:20:16.846
Victor!

1736
03:20:52.804 --> 03:20:54.471
Victor!

1737
03:20:58.138 --> 03:21:00.638
I watched your island burn,

1738
03:21:00.721 --> 03:21:04.346
your sisters
begging for their lives.


1739
03:21:04.429 --> 03:21:07.054
As did your mother.

1740
03:21:07.138 --> 03:21:08.221
Liar.

1741
03:21:33.763 --> 03:21:35.929
I can't maintain this!

1742
03:21:36.721 --> 03:21:37.846
Victor!

1743
03:21:59.888 --> 03:22:02.179
Victor, I can't hold this!

1744
03:22:08.804 --> 03:22:11.179
For Darkseid.

1745
03:22:15.013 --> 03:22:17.513
Not impressed.

1746
03:23:01.971 --> 03:23:03.179
All right.

1747
03:23:03.263 --> 03:23:04.929
Kal
-El.

1748
03:23:43.221 --> 03:23:45.554
Barry, I'm connected
to The Unity.


1749
03:23:45.638 --> 03:23:47.804
I need the charge
to get inside.


1750
03:24:09.764 --> 03:24:10.847
Barry?

1751
03:24:11.597 --> 03:24:13.430
Barry, are you okay?

1752
03:24:14.847 --> 03:24:16.014
<i>Barry!</i>

1753
03:24:16.097 --> 03:24:17.305
I got the wind
knocked out of me.


1754
03:24:17.389 --> 03:24:20.097
Need a few seconds,
that's all!


1755
03:24:36.930 --> 03:24:39.639
Barry, where are you?
It's almost synchronized!


1756
03:24:39.722 --> 03:24:41.597
Okay, okay.

1757
03:24:41.680 --> 03:24:44.555
Oh, my God. Gotta heal, Barry.

1758
03:24:44.639 --> 03:24:46.430
Heal. Heal.

1759
03:25:12.180 --> 03:25:13.847
Barry!

1760
03:25:26.639 --> 03:25:28.472
It's too late.

1761
03:25:29.722 --> 03:25:31.222
Oh, no.

1762
03:25:35.305 --> 03:25:37.097
He's here!

1763
03:26:06.472 --> 03:26:07.722
Okay.

1764
03:26:07.805 --> 03:26:08.889
Just gotta go faster
than the speed of light.


1765
03:26:08.972 --> 03:26:10.055
Far beyond the speed of light.

1766
03:26:10.139 --> 03:26:11.389
You gotta break the rule,
Barry,


1767
03:26:11.472 --> 03:26:13.597
and you gotta do it now.

1768
03:26:26.472 --> 03:26:28.389
Dad...

1769
03:26:32.014 --> 03:26:34.555
whatever happens,
I want you to know


1770
03:26:37.055 --> 03:26:39.264
your kid was one of them, Dad.

1771
03:26:42.305 --> 03:26:44.389
One of the best of the best.

1772
03:27:39.639 --> 03:27:42.347
Make your own future.

1773
03:27:48.639 --> 03:27:50.764
Make your own past.

1774
03:27:55.265 --> 03:27:58.931
It's all right now.

1775
03:28:45.765 --> 03:28:48.140
We've been waiting
for you, Victor.


1776
03:28:49.140 --> 03:28:51.348
My broken boy.

1777
03:28:53.515 --> 03:28:55.723
You don't have to be
alone anymore.


1778
03:28:55.806 --> 03:28:57.598
We'll be together again.

1779
03:29:05.140 --> 03:29:07.515
we can put it back, Vic.

1780
03:29:11.681 --> 03:29:13.973
Make you whole again.

1781
03:29:25.681 --> 03:29:27.598
I'm not broken.

1782
03:29:37.181 --> 03:29:39.181
And I'm not alone.

1783
03:29:55.848 --> 03:29:57.015
Superman!

1784
03:31:27.556 --> 03:31:29.640
I told you

1785
03:31:31.056 --> 03:31:33.848
Steppenwolf would fail.

1786
03:31:34.640 --> 03:31:38.473
Yes. Yes, you did.

1787
03:31:39.015 --> 03:31:40.265
My master,

1788
03:31:40.348 --> 03:31:44.181
now that the Mother Boxes
have been destroyed,


1789
03:31:44.265 --> 03:31:48.224
how will you retrieve
your great prize?


1790
03:31:48.307 --> 03:31:51.766
Anti
-Life is found, DeSaad.

1791
03:31:51.849 --> 03:31:56.766
And we will stop
at nothing to possess it.


1792
03:31:59.807 --> 03:32:01.432
Ready the armada.

1793
03:32:02.182 --> 03:32:04.807
We will use the old ways.

1794
03:34:28.849 --> 03:34:31.266
<i>Your father twice over.</i>

1795
03:34:38.307 --> 03:34:40.849
<i>Now, let me speak to you
from my heart,</i>


1796
03:34:40.932 --> 03:34:42.849
<i>not as a scientist,</i>

1797
03:34:42.932 --> 03:34:44.557
<i>as a father.</i>

1798
03:34:44.641 --> 03:34:47.974
<i>Your father twice over.</i>

1799
03:34:50.266 --> 03:34:53.724
<i>I brought you into the world
and back to it.</i>


1800
03:34:53.807 --> 03:34:58.099
<i>You can't imagine how proud
I am of who you are.</i>


1801
03:34:58.182 --> 03:34:59.849
<i>Have always been.</i>

1802
03:35:01.849 --> 03:35:03.224
<i>So many years
with you I wasted.</i>


1803
03:35:03.307 --> 03:35:06.974
<i>So many wrongs
I've left un-righted.</i>


1804
03:35:09.224 --> 03:35:11.641
<i>Everything breaks, Victor.</i>

1805
03:35:11.724 --> 03:35:14.141
<i>Everything changes.</i>

1806
03:35:24.641 --> 03:35:26.891
I gotta go see my father.

1807
03:36:02.267 --> 03:36:04.308
<i>The world is hurt.</i>

1808
03:36:04.392 --> 03:36:05.475
<i>Broken.</i>

1809
03:36:05.558 --> 03:36:07.975
<i>Unexchangeable.</i>

1810
03:36:08.058 --> 03:36:09.850
Ship's
all yours now, kid.


1811
03:36:09.933 --> 03:36:11.392
You're the boss.

1812
03:36:13.433 --> 03:36:16.850
"Ryan Choi,
Director of Nanotechnology."


1813
03:36:16.933 --> 03:36:18.558
That's your thing.

1814
03:36:19.100 --> 03:36:21.017
Uh, yep.

1815
03:36:21.100 --> 03:36:22.808
That's my thing.

1816
03:36:27.558 --> 03:36:31.808
<i>But the world's
not fixed in the past,</i>


1817
03:36:31.892 --> 03:36:33.183
<i>only the future.</i>

1818
03:36:34.892 --> 03:36:38.767
<i>The not yet. The now.</i>

1819
03:36:38.850 --> 03:36:42.433
Wow.
Must be 100, 150 feet.


1820
03:36:42.517 --> 03:36:43.975
Must be.

1821
03:36:44.975 --> 03:36:46.683
Big round table.

1822
03:36:46.767 --> 03:36:49.058
Six chairs, right there.

1823
03:36:50.058 --> 03:36:51.808
But room for more.

1824
03:36:54.100 --> 03:36:55.892
But room for more.

1825
03:36:56.767 --> 03:36:58.600
God help us.

1826
03:37:00.267 --> 03:37:02.433
<i>The now is you.</i>

1827
03:37:06.058 --> 03:37:07.517
What?

1828
03:37:07.600 --> 03:37:10.350
It's actually the worst job
you can get in a crime lab.


1829
03:37:10.433 --> 03:37:12.933
But, uh,
my foot's in the door.


1830
03:37:13.017 --> 03:37:14.767
This is like a "job" job?

1831
03:37:15.475 --> 03:37:16.683
"Job" job.

1832
03:37:20.142 --> 03:37:22.933
Your foot's in the door.

1833
03:37:25.058 --> 03:37:26.308
Isn't that a thing people say?

1834
03:37:26.392 --> 03:37:28.308
Your foot's in the door.

1835
03:37:28.392 --> 03:37:30.725
Yeah, that's something
people say, man.


1836
03:37:30.808 --> 03:37:32.392
His foot's in the door!

1837
03:37:32.475 --> 03:37:35.225
- That's my boy, right there!
- Oh, gosh. Oh, gosh.


1838
03:37:35.350 --> 03:37:36.642
Taught him nothing he knows.

1839
03:37:36.725 --> 03:37:37.892
- Yes!
- Dad, you're gonna


1840
03:37:37.975 --> 03:37:39.100
get maced again.

1841
03:37:42.392 --> 03:37:44.267
No stopping you now.

1842
03:37:46.308 --> 03:37:47.600
Thanks, Dad.

1843
03:37:47.683 --> 03:37:48.933
<i>Now.</i>

1844
03:37:49.017 --> 03:37:52.058
<i>Now's your time, Victor,
to rise.</i>


1845
03:37:52.142 --> 03:37:55.183
"Thank you" is not enough
for what you did.


1846
03:37:55.267 --> 03:37:58.892
I just undid a mistake,
that's all.


1847
03:38:09.017 --> 03:38:11.975
How did you get the house
back from the bank?


1848
03:38:12.058 --> 03:38:14.225
I bought the bank.

1849
03:38:16.475 --> 03:38:19.058
Congratulations, by the way.

1850
03:38:19.142 --> 03:38:20.850
<i>Do this. Be this.</i>

1851
03:38:20.933 --> 03:38:26.183
<i>The man I never was.
The hero you are.</i>


1852
03:38:26.267 --> 03:38:28.600
<i>Take your place
among the brave ones.</i>


1853
03:38:28.683 --> 03:38:33.808
<i>The ones that were, that are,
that are yet to be.</i>


1854
03:39:06.433 --> 03:39:09.517
<i>It's time you stand,</i>

1855
03:39:13.183 --> 03:39:14.767
<i>fight,</i>

1856
03:39:17.267 --> 03:39:18.808
<i>discover,</i>

1857
03:39:23.433 --> 03:39:25.642
<i>heal, love,</i>

1858
03:39:29.100 --> 03:39:30.267
<i>win.</i>

1859
03:39:56.768 --> 03:39:58.559
<i>The time</i>

1860
03:39:58.643 --> 03:40:00.143
<i>is now.</i>

1861
03:40:09.143 --> 03:40:10.518
Ready?

1862
03:40:10.601 --> 03:40:11.768
Come on, Stevens.

1863
03:40:15.518 --> 03:40:16.934
All right,
let's keep it moving.


1864
03:40:18.726 --> 03:40:19.976
Keep going.

1865
03:40:21.476 --> 03:40:23.559
Come on, Luthor. Let's go.

1866
03:40:27.143 --> 03:40:28.351
Luthor.

1867
03:40:33.184 --> 03:40:34.351
Open up two, Carl, please.

1868
03:40:43.393 --> 03:40:44.809
Luthor.

1869
03:40:49.601 --> 03:40:51.226
All right,
stop jerking around, Luthor,


1870
03:40:51.309 --> 03:40:53.059
or I'm gonna
have to come in there.


1871
03:42:21.559 --> 03:42:23.601
Ah, there he is.

1872
03:42:24.268 --> 03:42:25.434
Welcome aboard.

1873
03:42:25.518 --> 03:42:27.434
Care for a glass
of Gout de Diamants?


1874
03:42:27.518 --> 03:42:29.476
I was just celebrating
God's return.


1875
03:42:29.559 --> 03:42:32.018
Out of the ground
and back up into the sky.


1876
03:42:32.101 --> 03:42:34.684
I heard you were
a few clowns short of a circus.


1877
03:42:34.768 --> 03:42:36.393
I was, thank you,

1878
03:42:36.476 --> 03:42:38.726
until the good doctors
at Arkham helped me


1879
03:42:38.809 --> 03:42:40.893
find some much needed clarity.

1880
03:42:40.976 --> 03:42:43.309
Now, you volunteered
to destroy the bat


1881
03:42:43.393 --> 03:42:44.434
free of charge.

1882
03:42:44.518 --> 03:42:46.309
Why the pro bono work?

1883
03:42:46.393 --> 03:42:48.393
It's personal.

1884
03:42:48.476 --> 03:42:51.476
Ah, let me guess,
an eye for an eye?


1885
03:42:53.309 --> 03:42:55.101
You said you had something
I'd want?


1886
03:42:55.184 --> 03:42:56.601
You'd better not be
wasting my time.


1887
03:42:56.684 --> 03:42:58.893
Ooh. And endure
your wrath, Mr. Wilson?


1888
03:42:58.976 --> 03:43:00.768
No, I wouldn't think of it.

1889
03:43:00.851 --> 03:43:02.226
Uh, I have too much
to live for.


1890
03:43:02.309 --> 03:43:05.393
And more important things
to do.


1891
03:43:05.476 --> 03:43:08.934
But if you want the Batman,

1892
03:43:09.018 --> 03:43:12.393
here is something
that can help you.


1893
03:43:13.559 --> 03:43:17.851
His name is Bruce Wayne.

1894
03:43:20.893 --> 03:43:23.476
Hmm. On second thought,

1895
03:43:25.560 --> 03:43:27.727
we do have something
to celebrate.


1896
03:43:28.769 --> 03:43:30.269
Good boy.

1897
03:44:34.519 --> 03:44:35.810
Clear.

1898
03:44:41.185 --> 03:44:42.810
How much further?

1899
03:44:43.935 --> 03:44:45.269
We're almost there.

1900
03:44:47.352 --> 03:44:48.852
Well, we need to hurry.

1901
03:44:48.935 --> 03:44:50.685
We can't be out in the open
much longer.


1902
03:44:50.769 --> 03:44:52.519
He'll come for us.

1903
03:44:55.310 --> 03:44:57.352
Let him come.

1904
03:44:57.435 --> 03:44:59.227
Let the bastard come.

1905
03:45:00.435 --> 03:45:02.602
I'll stab this
through his heart


1906
03:45:02.685 --> 03:45:05.019
for what he did to Arthur.

1907
03:45:05.102 --> 03:45:07.185
I want to make him pay.

1908
03:45:08.644 --> 03:45:11.394
I understand
how you feel, Mera.


1909
03:45:11.477 --> 03:45:14.394
You have no idea how I feel.

1910
03:45:14.477 --> 03:45:16.352
But we have to
stick to the plan


1911
03:45:16.435 --> 03:45:18.852
to have any chance
to make this right.


1912
03:45:26.644 --> 03:45:30.185
Who have you ever loved?

1913
03:45:44.019 --> 03:45:47.477
<i>Au contraire,</i>
my little fish stick.


1914
03:45:51.019 --> 03:45:52.685
He knows exactly
what it's like


1915
03:45:52.769 --> 03:45:54.644
to lose someone he loves.

1916
03:45:56.519 --> 03:45:58.894
You know, like, uh,

1917
03:46:00.144 --> 03:46:01.602
a father,

1918
03:46:02.935 --> 03:46:05.019
like a mother.

1919
03:46:05.102 --> 03:46:08.435
Be very careful
with the next thing you say.


1920
03:46:09.935 --> 03:46:12.102
Like an adopted son.

1921
03:46:15.727 --> 03:46:17.477
Isn't that right,

1922
03:46:18.894 --> 03:46:20.477
Batman?

1923
03:46:23.602 --> 03:46:24.894
Maybe, in a way,

1924
03:46:24.977 --> 03:46:26.935
that smelly
old flounder is right.


1925
03:46:28.519 --> 03:46:31.310
Because how many
can die in your arms


1926
03:46:31.394 --> 03:46:33.060
before you grow numb to death?

1927
03:46:34.519 --> 03:46:37.477
That's not very careful.

1928
03:46:37.560 --> 03:46:41.310
And how many dead eyes
can you look into


1929
03:46:41.394 --> 03:46:44.227
before you die inside
yourself?


1930
03:46:44.310 --> 03:46:48.144
I've been dead inside
a long time,


1931
03:46:48.227 --> 03:46:50.102
but even I have a limit.

1932
03:46:50.185 --> 03:46:52.102
And if you cross that line,
I swear to God, I will...


1933
03:46:52.185 --> 03:46:55.144
Before what, Bruce? Kill me?

1934
03:46:55.227 --> 03:46:57.144
You won't kill me.

1935
03:46:57.894 --> 03:47:00.060
I'm your best friend.

1936
03:47:00.144 --> 03:47:04.519
Besides, who's gonna give you
a reach-around?


1937
03:47:06.394 --> 03:47:07.894
Anyway,

1938
03:47:09.060 --> 03:47:10.727
you need me.

1939
03:47:11.685 --> 03:47:13.477
You

1940
03:47:13.560 --> 03:47:16.477
need me to help you
undo this world


1941
03:47:16.561 --> 03:47:19.478
you created
by letting her die.


1942
03:47:21.936 --> 03:47:23.853
Poor Lois.

1943
03:47:23.936 --> 03:47:26.895
How she suffered so!

1944
03:47:32.645 --> 03:47:34.895
I often wonder

1945
03:47:34.978 --> 03:47:36.811
how many
alternate timelines


1946
03:47:36.895 --> 03:47:39.311
do you destroy
the world because...


1947
03:47:40.311 --> 03:47:41.853
frankly, you don't have

1948
03:47:41.936 --> 03:47:44.645
the cojones to die yourself.

1949
03:47:45.561 --> 03:47:47.061
Hmm?

1950
03:47:49.103 --> 03:47:50.311
So, as usual,

1951
03:47:50.395 --> 03:47:53.020
I'll be the bigger man.

1952
03:47:56.770 --> 03:47:58.311
A truce,

1953
03:47:59.061 --> 03:48:00.811
Bruce.

1954
03:48:02.978 --> 03:48:07.311
As long as you
have this card, a truce.


1955
03:48:10.186 --> 03:48:11.228
But all you have to do

1956
03:48:11.311 --> 03:48:12.478
is tear it in half

1957
03:48:12.561 --> 03:48:14.061
and I'm happy
to discuss with you


1958
03:48:14.145 --> 03:48:16.728
in any way you like,
why you sent the Boy Wonder


1959
03:48:18.311 --> 03:48:20.311
to do a man's job?

1960
03:48:23.561 --> 03:48:25.395
You know, it's funny

1961
03:48:25.478 --> 03:48:26.895
that you would talk
about people


1962
03:48:26.978 --> 03:48:28.561
who died in my arms

1963
03:48:28.645 --> 03:48:30.436
because when I held
Harley Quinn


1964
03:48:30.520 --> 03:48:33.061
and she was bleeding
and dying,


1965
03:48:33.145 --> 03:48:36.853
she begged me
with her last breath


1966
03:48:36.936 --> 03:48:39.145
that when I killed you,

1967
03:48:39.228 --> 03:48:42.895
and make no mistake,
I will fucking kill you...


1968
03:48:42.978 --> 03:48:44.978
that I'd do it slow.

1969
03:48:46.020 --> 03:48:48.145
I'm gonna honor that promise.

1970
03:49:18.603 --> 03:49:21.478
Oh. You're good.

1971
03:49:25.686 --> 03:49:27.395
You almost had me.

1972
03:49:46.686 --> 03:49:47.811
Where are we holing up?

1973
03:49:47.895 --> 03:49:50.436
Somewhere he'll never suspect.

1974
03:49:50.520 --> 03:49:53.478
Still think it was a good idea
bringing him along?


1975
03:49:53.561 --> 03:49:56.353
what do you think?

1976
03:50:02.311 --> 03:50:03.436
He's found us.

1977
03:51:32.521 --> 03:51:35.062
Can I help you?

1978
03:51:35.146 --> 03:51:38.771
I'm sure you know Darkseid
is not finished with Earth.


1979
03:51:38.854 --> 03:51:41.979
The Anti-Life Equation
is here somewhere.


1980
03:51:42.062 --> 03:51:45.021
We have to find it
before he does.


1981
03:51:45.104 --> 03:51:47.021
There's a war coming.

1982
03:51:47.104 --> 03:51:48.937
And I'm here to help.

1983
03:51:49.021 --> 03:51:51.354
I'm sorry, who are you again?

1984
03:51:51.437 --> 03:51:53.562
I've gone by many names

1985
03:51:53.646 --> 03:51:56.937
and taken many forms.
And like you,


1986
03:51:57.021 --> 03:51:59.771
I've realized I have
a stake in this world


1987
03:51:59.854 --> 03:52:02.562
and it's time
I started fighting for it.


1988
03:52:03.229 --> 03:52:04.437
Oh.

1989
03:52:05.854 --> 03:52:08.187
Well, we could
definitely use the help.


1990
03:52:08.271 --> 03:52:11.687
So, glad you're here.

1991
03:52:12.771 --> 03:52:13.854
You know, I never thought

1992
03:52:13.937 --> 03:52:14.979
I'd see
the defenders of Earth


1993
03:52:15.062 --> 03:52:18.062
united and fighting as one.

1994
03:52:18.146 --> 03:52:20.812
It wouldn't have happened
without you, Bruce.


1995
03:52:22.021 --> 03:52:24.646
Your mother and father
would be proud.


1996
03:52:25.896 --> 03:52:27.187
I hope so.

1997
03:52:33.062 --> 03:52:36.187
Well, I'll be in touch.

1998
03:52:37.062 --> 03:52:41.187
Oh, and some have called me

1999
03:52:41.271 --> 03:52:43.729
the Martian Manhunter.

2000
03:52:51.229 --> 03:52:53.812
I guess I'll see you around.

2001
03:53:34.005 --> 03:53:39.005
