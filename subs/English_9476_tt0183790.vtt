2
00:00:58.695 --> 00:00:59.975
Should we help him?

3
00:01:00.363 --> 00:01:03.981
He's due in the lists in two minutes.
Two minutes or forfeit.


4
00:01:04.325 --> 00:01:05.701
Lend us those.

5
00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:08.696
Right. Left.

6
00:01:20.341 --> 00:01:22.832
-Dead.
-Eh?


7
00:01:24.637 --> 00:01:26.843
Three scores to none after two lances.

8
00:01:27.181 --> 00:01:30.550
As long as Sir Ector doesn't
fall off his horse, we've won.


9
00:01:32.436 --> 00:01:34.014
He's dead.

10
00:01:35.689 --> 00:01:39.639
-What do you mean?
-His life's spark is covered in shite.


11
00:01:40.861 --> 00:01:43.399
His spirit is gone
but his stench remains.


12
00:01:43.613 --> 00:01:47.148
-Does that answer your question?
-No, no, no.


13
00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:49.734
No, he sleeps. Rouse him.

14
00:01:50.704 --> 00:01:52.992
I haven't eaten in three days!

15
00:01:53.206 --> 00:01:54.534
None of us have!

16
00:01:54.749 --> 00:01:58.035
-Let's fetch a priest.
-No, he's not dead!


17
00:01:58.378 --> 00:02:01.332
You wake up! Come on!

18
00:02:02.257 --> 00:02:03.419
Come on!

19
00:02:05.718 --> 00:02:07.510
You manky git!

20
00:02:08.888 --> 00:02:10.263
Roland.

21
00:02:12.391 --> 00:02:16.436
Squire, Sir Ector must report
at once or forfeit the match.


22
00:02:17.396 --> 00:02:18.771
He's on his way.

23
00:02:21.108 --> 00:02:23.516
I haven't eaten in three days!

24
00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:25.942
Three days! What did you eat, mate?

25
00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:28.771
If you wasn't dead, 
I would kill you!

26
00:02:29.158 --> 00:02:30.901
I'll ride in his place.

27
00:02:32.327 --> 00:02:35.328
Strip his armor.
I'm riding in his place.


28
00:02:35.664 --> 00:02:39.661
Wat, stop kicking him!
I'm riding in his place. Help me.


29
00:02:40.544 --> 00:02:41.872
What's your name, William?

30
00:02:44.297 --> 00:02:47.251
William Thatcher, answer me
with your name.


31
00:02:48.968 --> 00:02:50.249
It's not Sir William.

32
00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:53.175
It's not Count or Duke or King William.

33
00:02:53.598 --> 00:02:54.594
I know that.

34
00:02:55.642 --> 00:02:57.967
You must be of noble birth to compete.

35
00:02:58.186 --> 00:03:02.349
A detail. The landscape is food.
Do you want to eat or not?


36
00:03:03.691 --> 00:03:06.858
If the nobles find out,
there'll be the devil to pay.


37
00:03:07.862 --> 00:03:09.819
Then pray that they don't.

38
00:04:50.419 --> 00:04:51.748
Visor.

39
00:04:52.046 --> 00:04:53.540
Come on, we're late.

40
00:05:27.789 --> 00:05:32.664
The score stands at three lances
to none in favor of Sir Ector.


41
00:05:33.461 --> 00:05:34.789
Lord Philip of Aragon.

42
00:05:35.296 --> 00:05:36.920
Stand ye ready?

43
00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:42.254
Sir Ector. Stand ye ready?

44
00:05:43.345 --> 00:05:44.341
Ready?

45
00:05:44.638 --> 00:05:46.761
I tilted against Sir Ector many times.

46
00:05:46.974 --> 00:05:49.809
ln practice as his target.
You never struck him.


47
00:05:50.102 --> 00:05:53.601
-Badger me not with details.
-The landscape. Stay on the horse.


48
00:05:53.939 --> 00:05:57.522
He needs 3 points.
He has to knock you off the horse.


49
00:05:57.859 --> 00:06:00.018
I know how to score, Roland.

50
00:06:01.154 --> 00:06:03.645
I've waited my whole life
for this moment.


51
00:06:04.491 --> 00:06:07.029
For Sir Ector to shite himself
to death?


52
00:06:44.863 --> 00:06:47.354
Get it in the cradle. ln the cradle.

53
00:06:47.658 --> 00:06:48.938
Get it in the cradle!

54
00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:12.008
William, are you alive?

55
00:07:12.307 --> 00:07:14.465
-We won! We won!
-Can you hear me?


56
00:07:15.309 --> 00:07:18.844
Get off me! William, can you hear me?

57
00:07:19.939 --> 00:07:21.184
We won!

58
00:07:21.482 --> 00:07:23.890
He's breathing. 
He's breathing!

59
00:07:25.528 --> 00:07:27.070
Sir Ector.

60
00:07:32.910 --> 00:07:35.068
Sir Ector. Remove your helmet.

61
00:07:38.248 --> 00:07:43.243
My lord, the final blow of the lance
has bent it onto my head.


62
00:07:43.587 --> 00:07:45.579
He says the final blow of the--

63
00:07:47.466 --> 00:07:49.921
I present your champion, my lord.

64
00:08:16.243 --> 00:08:17.441
Twenty.

65
00:08:17.745 --> 00:08:18.907
No, 10.

66
00:08:19.246 --> 00:08:21.618
-Fifteen.
-Done.


67
00:08:26.295 --> 00:08:27.955
Very good. Cheers.

68
00:08:32.759 --> 00:08:35.511
Fifteen silver florins.
He didn't want that.


69
00:08:35.804 --> 00:08:37.512
That's five for William.

70
00:08:37.806 --> 00:08:41.969
Five for Wat. Five for Roland,
who's going home to England.


71
00:08:42.352 --> 00:08:45.721
Straight to the pub for me.
Eel pie, brie tart...


72
00:08:45.939 --> 00:08:48.856
...tansy cakes with peppermint cream.

73
00:08:53.488 --> 00:08:54.816
We could do this.

74
00:08:55.031 --> 00:08:57.652
We've done it, boy.
That's silver in your hand.


75
00:08:58.493 --> 00:09:01.529
No, I mean, we can do this.
We can be champions.


76
00:09:05.666 --> 00:09:07.540
Give us your coins.

77
00:09:11.630 --> 00:09:12.959
Give me your coins.

78
00:09:16.719 --> 00:09:18.676
Now, that's one for you.

79
00:09:19.012 --> 00:09:21.883
And one...for you.

80
00:09:22.224 --> 00:09:24.797
Which leaves 13.

81
00:09:25.227 --> 00:09:27.848
That's 13 for training
and outfitting.


82
00:09:28.689 --> 00:09:31.014
The tournament in Rouen is in a month.

83
00:09:31.399 --> 00:09:33.558
We could split a bigger prize.

84
00:09:35.195 --> 00:09:38.729
In one month we'd be on our way
to glory and riches.


85
00:09:39.366 --> 00:09:44.490
Or lying in a ditch with Sir Ector.
William, I just want to go home.


86
00:09:44.704 --> 00:09:49.247
Tansy cakes. Dilled veal balls.
I'll take my five now.


87
00:09:55.923 --> 00:09:57.548
Oh, wait up.

88
00:09:58.009 --> 00:10:00.167
You're going the wrong way!

89
00:10:01.554 --> 00:10:02.929
You can't even joust.

90
00:10:03.222 --> 00:10:06.922
Most of it is the guts to take a blow.
Guts I have.


91
00:10:07.226 --> 00:10:10.559
And technique?
I have a month to learn that.


92
00:10:10.938 --> 00:10:13.892
And name a man better
with a sword than I am.


93
00:10:14.107 --> 00:10:17.690
-In the practice ring.
-You're not of noble birth.


94
00:10:17.903 --> 00:10:19.445
So, we lie.

95
00:10:19.738 --> 00:10:23.237
How did the nobles become noble
in the first place?


96
00:10:24.618 --> 00:10:28.236
They took it at the tip of a sword.
I'll do it with a lance.


97
00:10:28.622 --> 00:10:31.159
-A blunted lance.
-No matter, Wat.


98
00:10:31.416 --> 00:10:36.291
A man can change his stars. I won't
spend the rest of my life as nothing.


99
00:10:38.089 --> 00:10:41.292
That is nothing. And that's
where glory will take us.


100
00:10:41.634 --> 00:10:45.928
We're peasants. Glory and riches
are beyond our grasp.


101
00:10:46.222 --> 00:10:48.927
But a full stomach?
That dream can come true.


102
00:10:58.776 --> 00:11:02.145
If you can take your coins,
go eat cake in England.


103
00:11:02.446 --> 00:11:05.649
But if you can't, you come with me.

104
00:11:12.080 --> 00:11:14.120
You see? Money doesn't matter.

105
00:11:28.304 --> 00:11:29.549
See how hungry I am?

106
00:11:29.973 --> 00:11:31.965
-Do you?
-Damn your stomach, Wat!


107
00:11:34.602 --> 00:11:35.977
Roland, please.

108
00:11:39.148 --> 00:11:43.015
With 1 3 silver pieces,
three men can change their stars.


109
00:11:51.827 --> 00:11:53.321
God love you, William.

110
00:11:53.620 --> 00:11:55.946
I know, I know. 
No one else will.

111
00:12:09.844 --> 00:12:11.469
Unlucky.

112
00:12:12.514 --> 00:12:14.506
-I think he's getting worse.
-He is getting worse.


113
00:12:29.197 --> 00:12:30.359
Switch.

114
00:12:36.704 --> 00:12:38.079
Switch.

115
00:12:39.498 --> 00:12:41.538
Glory and riches. 
Glory and riches!

116
00:12:53.136 --> 00:12:54.714
You see how dangerous it is?

117
00:12:55.889 --> 00:12:59.554
Faster! Faster!
All right, use those legs!


118
00:13:00.227 --> 00:13:02.552
Come on, Roland. Faster! Faster!

119
00:13:05.398 --> 00:13:09.266
-You missed it.
-You've done it dozens of times.


120
00:13:09.611 --> 00:13:12.565
Well, I guess that means
we should do it again.


121
00:13:15.074 --> 00:13:16.237
Come on.

122
00:13:18.619 --> 00:13:19.900
Come on, ponies.

123
00:13:20.246 --> 00:13:21.409
Fong him.

124
00:13:26.293 --> 00:13:28.120
Faster. Balance.

125
00:13:28.420 --> 00:13:30.911
No, slower. Keep it steady.

126
00:13:34.677 --> 00:13:36.468
I got it! Look, I got it!

127
00:13:50.275 --> 00:13:51.734
Any minute now.

128
00:14:23.641 --> 00:14:25.467
-Yes, better.
-Nice.


129
00:14:32.149 --> 00:14:34.556
-It's my turn to ride.
-No.


130
00:14:34.818 --> 00:14:37.487
We haven't reached the marker.
And you shouldn't.


131
00:14:38.113 --> 00:14:41.778
How would it look if my squire rode
while I walked?


132
00:14:42.117 --> 00:14:46.577
I don't give a witch's teat!
It's my turn! It's my turn!


133
00:14:46.913 --> 00:14:51.456
Maybe nobody should ride.
The horse is not what he used to be.


134
00:14:51.793 --> 00:14:54.248
Fine. Fine.

135
00:14:56.673 --> 00:14:57.787
Morning.

136
00:14:58.800 --> 00:14:59.914
Morning.

137
00:15:00.259 --> 00:15:01.588
Hoy, sir.

138
00:15:07.516 --> 00:15:08.548
What are you doing?

139
00:15:09.226 --> 00:15:11.302
Uh...trudging.

140
00:15:14.690 --> 00:15:16.848
You know, trudging? To trudge?

141
00:15:17.192 --> 00:15:19.565
To trudge the slow, weary...

142
00:15:19.903 --> 00:15:23.687
...depressing, yet determined walk
of a man who had nothing left...


143
00:15:23.991 --> 00:15:27.525
...except the impulse to simply
soldier on.


144
00:15:28.036 --> 00:15:29.661
Were you robbed?

145
00:15:30.205 --> 00:15:32.874
Interesting question. Yes.

146
00:15:33.125 --> 00:15:35.876
And at the same time,
a huge, resounding, '' No.''


147
00:15:36.253 --> 00:15:40.416
It's more a sort of involuntary
vow of poverty, really.


148
00:15:40.715 --> 00:15:44.214
But on the brighter side,
trudging does represent pride.


149
00:15:44.594 --> 00:15:48.212
Pride, resolve and faith
in the good Lord Almighty.


150
00:15:48.556 --> 00:15:51.261
Please, Christ, rescue me
from my current...


151
00:15:52.727 --> 00:15:54.387
...tribulations.

152
00:15:55.897 --> 00:15:57.474
Who are you?

153
00:16:00.067 --> 00:16:01.894
Lilium inter spinas.

154
00:16:02.611 --> 00:16:04.438
The lily among the thorns.

155
00:16:04.738 --> 00:16:07.408
Geoffrey Chaucer's the name.
Writing's the game.


156
00:16:14.331 --> 00:16:15.659
Chaucer?

157
00:16:16.875 --> 00:16:18.666
Geoffrey Chaucer, the writer?

158
00:16:22.672 --> 00:16:25.342
-A what?
-''A what?'' A writer.


159
00:16:25.675 --> 00:16:30.670
I write with ink and parchment.
For a penny, I'll scribble anything.


160
00:16:30.930 --> 00:16:35.343
Summonses, decrees, edicts,
warrants, patents of nobility.


161
00:16:36.102 --> 00:16:39.352
I've been known to jot down
a poem, if the muse descends.


162
00:16:39.606 --> 00:16:42.606
You probably read my book,
The Book of the Duchess.


163
00:16:45.695 --> 00:16:47.237
Well, it was allegorical.

164
00:16:47.613 --> 00:16:51.445
We won't hold it against you.
Each man decides that for himself.


165
00:16:52.702 --> 00:16:54.777
Did you say patents of nobility?

166
00:16:57.373 --> 00:16:58.950
That's right. I did.

167
00:17:02.294 --> 00:17:04.037
And you gentlemen are?

168
00:17:05.631 --> 00:17:08.797
I am Sir Ulrich von Lichtenstein
from Gelderland.


169
00:17:09.718 --> 00:17:14.594
These are my faithful squires,
Delves of Dodgington...


170
00:17:15.265 --> 00:17:18.135
...and Fowlehurst of Crewe.

171
00:17:19.227 --> 00:17:21.599
I'm Richard the Lionheart.
A pleasure.


172
00:17:21.938 --> 00:17:24.180
No, I'm Charlemagne!
John the Baptist!


173
00:17:24.399 --> 00:17:25.774
All right!

174
00:17:26.568 --> 00:17:28.726
Hold your tongue, sir, or lose it.

175
00:17:30.571 --> 00:17:33.572
Now you see that, 
I do believe...

176
00:17:34.075 --> 00:17:35.403
...Sir Ulrich.

177
00:17:36.911 --> 00:17:39.698
Thank you, Geoff.

178
00:17:41.666 --> 00:17:46.162
Have you any more to say, Master Nude,
or may we be on our way?


179
00:17:47.087 --> 00:17:50.088
-Off to the tournament?
-This is the road to Rouen.


180
00:17:50.716 --> 00:17:55.212
That remains to be seen.
They're limiting the field at Rouen.


181
00:17:55.763 --> 00:18:00.757
Noble birth must be established
for four generations on either side.


182
00:18:01.393 --> 00:18:04.394
Patents of nobility must be provided.

183
00:18:13.822 --> 00:18:15.613
Listen, clothe me...

184
00:18:16.616 --> 00:18:20.614
...shoe me, for God's sake, feed me
and you'll have your patents.


185
00:18:22.121 --> 00:18:23.319
No.

186
00:18:23.956 --> 00:18:27.621
-Patents of nobility.
-We need him. We need him.


187
00:18:28.419 --> 00:18:30.875
-Let me handle it.
-Be nice.


188
00:18:35.468 --> 00:18:37.460
Nice, nice, nice.

189
00:18:38.471 --> 00:18:39.846
All right.

190
00:18:41.473 --> 00:18:45.803
Betray us and I will fong you
until your insides are out...


191
00:18:46.145 --> 00:18:50.806
...your outsides are in and your
entrails are your extrails.


192
00:18:56.780 --> 00:18:58.060
Pain.

193
00:18:59.699 --> 00:19:01.158
Lots of pain.

194
00:19:10.835 --> 00:19:15.212
I present Sir Ulrich, whose mother's
father was Shilhard von Rechberg...


195
00:19:15.465 --> 00:19:20.257
...son of the Duke Guelph of Saxony,
son of Ghibellines, son of Wendish.


196
00:19:20.553 --> 00:19:23.589
-Wendish inherited the fief--
-That'll do, herald.


197
00:19:23.848 --> 00:19:27.715
Six generations is more than enough.
Show me the patents.


198
00:19:37.152 --> 00:19:41.482
lndicate in which events
shall your Lord Ulrich compete.


199
00:19:45.035 --> 00:19:48.202
He'll first meet Roger Lord Mortimer.

200
00:19:48.580 --> 00:19:50.537
Thank you very much.

201
00:20:00.884 --> 00:20:03.719
I can't believe it.
You did it, Chaucer.


202
00:20:04.053 --> 00:20:06.840
I thank you. I didn't think
we had a chance.


203
00:20:10.893 --> 00:20:12.601
My pleasure, William.

204
00:20:12.895 --> 00:20:15.220
If you don't mind, 
I'll stick around.

205
00:20:15.481 --> 00:20:18.102
Be my herald, you'll
get part of the winnings.


206
00:20:18.359 --> 00:20:22.606
Done. Now if you don't mind,
I have to see a man about a dog.


207
00:20:25.950 --> 00:20:28.785
Walking out from Cheapside

208
00:20:29.495 --> 00:20:32.116
My fortunes for to seek

209
00:20:32.831 --> 00:20:35.500
I passed along the River Thames

210
00:20:35.792 --> 00:20:38.829
It's waters did they reek

211
00:20:40.964 --> 00:20:43.206
'Twas there I met a pretty lass

212
00:20:43.466 --> 00:20:46.467
She said her name was Nell

213
00:20:58.523 --> 00:21:01.310
Bell or hell rhymes with Nell.

214
00:21:58.914 --> 00:22:00.373
Would you speak to me?

215
00:22:01.542 --> 00:22:03.582
Ah, to speak.

216
00:22:05.421 --> 00:22:08.540
Sir, my sex are marked
by their silence.


217
00:22:08.882 --> 00:22:11.587
I would hear you speak
if it cost me my ears.


218
00:22:11.885 --> 00:22:14.922
That is well, for I do not
want silence in my life.


219
00:22:15.305 --> 00:22:17.097
Tell me your name.

220
00:22:20.352 --> 00:22:22.843
-Would you care if I were ugly?
-Yes!


221
00:22:24.106 --> 00:22:26.264
I mean, no. I mean--

222
00:22:26.566 --> 00:22:29.437
You desecrate the house of God!

223
00:22:45.001 --> 00:22:46.163
Tell me your name.

224
00:22:47.128 --> 00:22:50.461
And what would you do
with my name, Sir Hunter?


225
00:22:51.090 --> 00:22:53.759
Call me a fox, for
that is all I am to you.


226
00:22:55.302 --> 00:22:59.763
Then a fox you shall be until
I find your name, my foxy lady.


227
00:23:04.978 --> 00:23:07.434
He's a handsome hunter.
I give him that.


228
00:23:07.773 --> 00:23:10.442
Does this not shock you, ladies?

229
00:23:12.694 --> 00:23:13.975
Certainly, my lord.

230
00:23:14.988 --> 00:23:18.606
I only laugh just
to keep from weeping.


231
00:23:21.661 --> 00:23:22.942
Beauty is such a curse.

232
00:23:24.539 --> 00:23:26.413
Pray your years come swiftly.

233
00:23:26.749 --> 00:23:29.703
Pray your beauty fades
so you may better serve God.


234
00:23:30.753 --> 00:23:34.039
Oh, I do, my lord. I pray for it all
the time.


235
00:23:35.717 --> 00:23:38.801
Why, God, did you curse me
with this face?


236
00:23:40.012 --> 00:23:43.962
God's will has a purpose,
but we may not know it.


237
00:23:47.728 --> 00:23:49.886
Well, that is lovely.

238
00:24:20.635 --> 00:24:23.920
Sir Ulrich von Lichtenstein...

239
00:24:24.263 --> 00:24:29.602
...defeats Roger Lord Mortimer
one lance to none.


240
00:24:32.021 --> 00:24:35.022
Easy. They'll think l
never broke a lance before.


241
00:24:35.316 --> 00:24:39.728
-But you haven't!
-Ulrich's broken thousands of lances.


242
00:24:39.945 --> 00:24:42.816
Come on. You're due
in the sword ring.


243
00:24:43.157 --> 00:24:44.865
My armor's loose.

244
00:24:53.500 --> 00:24:55.742
Shite. I can't block an overhead.

245
00:24:56.003 --> 00:24:59.621
We can't fix it now.
We're overdue in the sword ring.


246
00:25:00.757 --> 00:25:04.173
It was a mistake to do two events.
I'm too hurried.


247
00:25:04.511 --> 00:25:08.010
-I'll withdraw from the sword.
-Sword's what you're best at.


248
00:25:08.348 --> 00:25:11.717
But the prizes and prestige
are bigger in the joust.


249
00:25:12.018 --> 00:25:15.185
Ulrich von Lichtenstein?
I am Simon the Summoner.


250
00:25:16.230 --> 00:25:18.472
I'm overdue at the sword ring.

251
00:25:19.692 --> 00:25:22.693
I must detain you
on behalf of your herald.


252
00:25:23.571 --> 00:25:25.195
You were never robbed.

253
00:25:28.409 --> 00:25:30.615
I have a gambling problem.

254
00:25:31.579 --> 00:25:33.536
I can't help myself.

255
00:25:33.873 --> 00:25:36.743
And these people will...

256
00:25:37.459 --> 00:25:40.330
...literally take the clothes
off your back.


257
00:25:41.713 --> 00:25:43.706
What are we supposed to do?

258
00:25:43.966 --> 00:25:48.426
He assured us that you,
his liege, would pay us.


259
00:25:52.724 --> 00:25:54.052
And who are you?

260
00:25:54.559 --> 00:25:57.394
Peter, a humble pardoner...

261
00:25:57.771 --> 00:26:00.143
...and purveyor of religious relics.

262
00:26:01.858 --> 00:26:03.021
How much does he owe?

263
00:26:03.568 --> 00:26:06.141
Ten gold florins.

264
00:26:07.405 --> 00:26:09.148
You manky git!

265
00:26:10.908 --> 00:26:13.613
-Pain! Pain! Take the pain!
-Get him off me!


266
00:26:13.911 --> 00:26:15.703
Wat, let him go!

267
00:26:25.798 --> 00:26:28.964
What would you do to him
if I was to refuse?


268
00:26:30.969 --> 00:26:34.136
We, on behalf of the Lord God...

269
00:26:34.473 --> 00:26:39.099
...will take it from his flesh
so that he may understand...


270
00:26:39.353 --> 00:26:41.808
...that gambling is a sin.

271
00:26:45.442 --> 00:26:46.817
Oh, come on.

272
00:26:47.819 --> 00:26:49.147
Please, Will.

273
00:26:52.615 --> 00:26:55.450
Please, will you help me,
Sir Ulrich?


274
00:26:57.161 --> 00:26:59.284
I promise you won't regret it.

275
00:27:01.791 --> 00:27:03.700
I don't have the money.

276
00:27:09.131 --> 00:27:10.673
Release him...

277
00:27:11.467 --> 00:27:14.136
...and give him back his clothes.

278
00:27:15.930 --> 00:27:17.673
And you'll get it.

279
00:27:18.223 --> 00:27:19.172
Done.

280
00:27:23.896 --> 00:27:24.809
You lied.

281
00:27:25.189 --> 00:27:29.850
Yes, I lied. I'm a writer.
I give the truth scope!


282
00:27:30.319 --> 00:27:34.150
Behold my Lord
Ulrich von Lichtenstein, son of--


283
00:27:34.489 --> 00:27:37.027
-Too late. He's been announced.
-Fine.


284
00:27:37.325 --> 00:27:40.908
Ten blows by sword.
Sir Ulrich to receive first.


285
00:27:47.835 --> 00:27:48.831
Strike!

286
00:27:57.803 --> 00:27:58.918
Strike!

287
00:27:59.138 --> 00:28:00.513
Stop letting him hit you!

288
00:28:00.723 --> 00:28:02.715
Shut up! Shut up!

289
00:28:04.185 --> 00:28:07.351
Two strikes for Sir Walter Loring!

290
00:28:07.688 --> 00:28:09.846
Sir Ulrich to strike!

291
00:28:10.649 --> 00:28:12.393
-Now it's your turn!
-Come on!


292
00:28:25.914 --> 00:28:27.242
Strike!

293
00:28:29.584 --> 00:28:31.244
I taught him that!
That's me!


294
00:28:32.045 --> 00:28:35.248
Sir Ulrich prevails,
five strikes to two!


295
00:28:36.883 --> 00:28:37.998
Yes!

296
00:28:38.259 --> 00:28:43.051
Behold my Lord Ulrich!
The rock! The hard place!


297
00:28:43.264 --> 00:28:46.218
Like a wind from Gelderland,
he sweeps by!


298
00:28:46.601 --> 00:28:50.550
Blown far from his homeland
in search of glory and honor!


299
00:28:50.896 --> 00:28:55.274
We walk in the garden
of his turbulence!


300
00:29:02.241 --> 00:29:03.865
Yeah!

301
00:30:30.660 --> 00:30:32.866
-You're champion.
-Of the sword.


302
00:30:33.120 --> 00:30:35.362
lsn't that why we're here? Come on.

303
00:30:35.581 --> 00:30:38.997
Do you want to touch him?
Do you want to touch him?


304
00:30:54.891 --> 00:30:57.299
We should've saved
for the blacksmith.


305
00:30:58.520 --> 00:30:59.895
I can't pay you now...

306
00:31:00.105 --> 00:31:03.687
-...but I promise I will, just as..
-No! Money.


307
00:31:07.529 --> 00:31:11.692
-Excuse me.
-Cash first, not promises.


308
00:31:12.367 --> 00:31:13.991
Go on.

309
00:31:16.079 --> 00:31:17.739
Excuse me, sir.

310
00:31:18.748 --> 00:31:21.037
You might try the farris.

311
00:31:22.376 --> 00:31:23.705
A woman?

312
00:31:24.086 --> 00:31:27.087
Beggars cannot be choosers, my lord.

313
00:31:29.884 --> 00:31:31.259
Thank you.

314
00:31:32.595 --> 00:31:35.512
-Excuse me.
-I don't work for free.


315
00:31:35.723 --> 00:31:39.934
-I can't joust with broken armor.
-That's your problem, not mine.


316
00:31:40.894 --> 00:31:43.848
Each drop of this sweat
has a price on it.


317
00:31:46.733 --> 00:31:50.102
Just as well. They told me
I was daft to even ask.


318
00:31:51.196 --> 00:31:54.232
-Who?
-The other armorers.


319
00:31:57.535 --> 00:32:00.323
Did they say I couldn't do it
because I'm a woman?


320
00:32:01.081 --> 00:32:03.868
They said you're good
with horseshoes, not armor.


321
00:32:04.125 --> 00:32:06.497
No one mentioned you being a woman.

322
00:32:10.590 --> 00:32:12.250
Cat's meat! Hot wine!

323
00:32:12.759 --> 00:32:14.751
Cat's meat! Hot wine!

324
00:32:31.110 --> 00:32:34.146
Lady, I will win
this tournament for you.


325
00:32:34.363 --> 00:32:36.355
Nay! I will win for you.

326
00:32:36.615 --> 00:32:38.358
May I present Count Adhemar...

327
00:32:38.575 --> 00:32:42.442
...winner of the joust in France
and champion at Saint-Emilion.


328
00:32:45.123 --> 00:32:50.118
All forgotten when standing before the
most beautiful woman in Christendom.


329
00:32:55.466 --> 00:33:00.461
Do you only pretend to fight, Count
Adhemar, or wage real war as well?


330
00:33:01.472 --> 00:33:06.300
I am leader of the free companies.
My army is in southern France.


331
00:33:08.646 --> 00:33:11.351
Geoff, 'tis my lady.

332
00:33:11.982 --> 00:33:16.146
-William, you aim too high.
-I don't know any other way to aim.


333
00:33:16.487 --> 00:33:19.690
-Concentrate.
-What should I say to her?


334
00:33:28.373 --> 00:33:30.033
What do you think of the joust?

335
00:33:30.709 --> 00:33:32.536
It's very abrupt.

336
00:33:33.253 --> 00:33:35.709
And I don't understand the rules.

337
00:33:36.590 --> 00:33:38.381
Then I shall educate you.

338
00:33:39.384 --> 00:33:42.219
A match is three lances.

339
00:33:43.388 --> 00:33:48.180
One point is given for breaking
a lance between the waist and neck.


340
00:33:48.393 --> 00:33:51.559
Two points for breaking on the helmet.
It's difficult.


341
00:33:51.896 --> 00:33:55.894
The helmet sweeps back.
Most blows glance off.


342
00:33:56.275 --> 00:33:59.810
Three points for bearing a rider
to the ground.


343
00:34:00.071 --> 00:34:03.404
Also, if you bear a rider
to the ground, you win his horse.


344
00:34:04.075 --> 00:34:06.067
Do men die in the joust?

345
00:34:06.410 --> 00:34:09.861
Lance points are tipped
with coronals, which blunts them.


346
00:34:10.414 --> 00:34:13.249
Of course, accidents happen.

347
00:34:14.752 --> 00:34:17.622
I myself, Jocelyn,
have never been unhorsed.


348
00:34:18.755 --> 00:34:20.415
Nor have I.

349
00:34:23.176 --> 00:34:24.505
Your name, lady.

350
00:34:25.011 --> 00:34:26.885
I still need to hear it.

351
00:34:27.764 --> 00:34:30.006
Sir Hunter, you persist.

352
00:34:30.433 --> 00:34:34.134
Perhaps angels have no names.
Only beautiful faces.


353
00:34:37.524 --> 00:34:38.852
And you are?

354
00:34:40.151 --> 00:34:41.432
I am, um....

355
00:34:41.694 --> 00:34:42.975
Have you forgotten?

356
00:34:43.237 --> 00:34:45.111
Or your name is Sir '' Um.''

357
00:34:46.616 --> 00:34:49.782
Ulrich von Lichtenstein
from Gelderland.


358
00:34:50.119 --> 00:34:52.657
I'd forget as well. 
What a mouthful.

359
00:34:53.372 --> 00:34:56.042
-Your armor, sir.
-What about it?


360
00:34:56.459 --> 00:35:01.286
How stylish of you to wear an antique.
You'll start a new fashion if you win.


361
00:35:01.630 --> 00:35:04.999
My grandfather will be able
to wear his in public again.


362
00:35:05.634 --> 00:35:08.469
And a shield. How quaint.

363
00:35:18.480 --> 00:35:23.225
Some of these poor country knights,
little better than peasants.


364
00:35:24.361 --> 00:35:25.855
--the second son...

365
00:35:26.196 --> 00:35:29.814
...of Sir Wallace Percival,
third Earl of Warwick.


366
00:35:30.200 --> 00:35:32.821
My lords, my ladies...

367
00:35:33.036 --> 00:35:36.654
...it is with honor
I introduce my liege...


368
00:35:37.540 --> 00:35:39.164
...Sir Thomas Colville.

369
00:35:46.507 --> 00:35:48.001
You're good.

370
00:35:49.176 --> 00:35:50.670
You're very good.

371
00:35:52.054 --> 00:35:53.513
My lords...

372
00:35:54.223 --> 00:35:55.717
...my ladies...

373
00:35:59.394 --> 00:36:03.059
...and everybody else here
not sitting on a cushion...


374
00:36:10.197 --> 00:36:11.857
...today...

375
00:36:13.533 --> 00:36:15.609
...you find yourselves equals.

376
00:36:23.251 --> 00:36:26.702
For you are all equally blessed.

377
00:36:27.880 --> 00:36:30.206
For I have the pride...

378
00:36:31.092 --> 00:36:33.380
...the privilege, nay, the pleasure...

379
00:36:34.387 --> 00:36:38.716
...of introducing to you
a knight sired by knights.


380
00:36:39.100 --> 00:36:42.468
A knight who can trace
his lineage back...


381
00:36:43.270 --> 00:36:45.393
...beyond Charlemagne.

382
00:36:47.441 --> 00:36:49.184
I first met him...

383
00:36:49.443 --> 00:36:51.649
...atop a mountain near Jerusalem...

384
00:36:51.945 --> 00:36:54.068
...praying to God...

385
00:36:54.573 --> 00:36:57.906
...asking his forgiveness
for the Saracen blood...


386
00:36:58.243 --> 00:37:00.152
...spilt by his sword.

387
00:37:00.412 --> 00:37:03.532
Next, he amazed me
still further in ltaly...


388
00:37:03.748 --> 00:37:05.955
...when he saved a fatherless
beauty...


389
00:37:06.209 --> 00:37:09.827
...from the would-be ravishings
of her dreadful uncle.


390
00:37:17.470 --> 00:37:19.095
In Greece...

391
00:37:19.931 --> 00:37:22.801
...he spent a year in silence...

392
00:37:24.602 --> 00:37:27.769
...just to better understand
the sound...


393
00:37:30.316 --> 00:37:31.940
...of a whisper.

394
00:37:38.490 --> 00:37:42.108
So without further gilding the lily
and with no more ado...


395
00:37:42.494 --> 00:37:45.116
...I give to you
the Seeker of Serenity...


396
00:37:45.455 --> 00:37:48.125
...Protector of Italian Virginity...

397
00:37:48.458 --> 00:37:53.286
...the Enforcer of our Lord God,
the one, the only...


398
00:37:53.630 --> 00:37:57.628
...Sir Ulrich von Lichtenstein!

399
00:38:10.855 --> 00:38:14.140
Thank you! Thank you!
I'll be here all week.


400
00:38:21.240 --> 00:38:22.485
That was different.

401
00:38:22.700 --> 00:38:24.858
It's time we celebrated
our differences.


402
00:38:25.077 --> 00:38:27.070
Just maybe not in public.

403
00:38:28.080 --> 00:38:29.159
You....

404
00:38:29.540 --> 00:38:33.158
Yes, I'm well aware
a good fonging is on the way.


405
00:38:33.544 --> 00:38:35.335
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

406
00:38:35.712 --> 00:38:38.797
I got their attention.
You win their hearts.


407
00:39:00.028 --> 00:39:01.356
Very good.

408
00:39:01.738 --> 00:39:03.529
-Was she watching? Geoff.
-What?


409
00:39:03.906 --> 00:39:05.899
-Did she see me?
-Yes, she did.


410
00:39:06.200 --> 00:39:08.359
-Did she see me take the hit?
-Yes.


411
00:39:08.619 --> 00:39:11.620
-Was she concerned?
-Her eyes welled up. Just awful.


412
00:39:26.553 --> 00:39:30.385
Colville has perfect technique.
I've never seen him before.


413
00:39:30.724 --> 00:39:32.052
Nor I.

414
00:39:32.392 --> 00:39:34.301
But this Lichtenstein.

415
00:39:34.603 --> 00:39:37.687
His technique, rudimentary.
Style, nonexistent.


416
00:39:37.898 --> 00:39:40.435
Still, he's fearless.

417
00:39:41.735 --> 00:39:43.774
Fearless? How so?

418
00:39:44.070 --> 00:39:47.938
The slit in the visor is narrow,
but splinters can penetrate it.


419
00:39:48.158 --> 00:39:51.194
Most knights raise their chins
at the last instant.


420
00:39:51.411 --> 00:39:56.405
You lose sight of your opponent, but
protect your eyes. Ulrich doesn't.


421
00:39:57.125 --> 00:39:59.283
He keeps his eye on the target.

422
00:40:00.461 --> 00:40:02.086
A true hunter.

423
00:40:12.097 --> 00:40:13.639
Sir Ulrich...

424
00:40:15.434 --> 00:40:16.430
...I'm through.

425
00:40:17.603 --> 00:40:20.972
But I've never not finished before.

426
00:40:21.773 --> 00:40:25.308
I wish to keep my honor intact.

427
00:40:50.676 --> 00:40:52.965
A draw. And Colville is hurt.

428
00:41:01.687 --> 00:41:05.305
Colville withdraws. 
Ulrich advances.

429
00:41:06.650 --> 00:41:08.477
Why didn't Ulrich finish him?

430
00:41:09.194 --> 00:41:11.021
He shows mercy.

431
00:41:12.823 --> 00:41:16.986
Then he shows his weakness.
That's all mercy is.


432
00:41:21.748 --> 00:41:24.832
For the love of victory, William,
go to sleep.


433
00:41:28.046 --> 00:41:29.326
I can't.

434
00:41:31.508 --> 00:41:34.508
Love has given me wings,
so I must fly.


435
00:41:37.221 --> 00:41:38.929
I can't explain it.

436
00:41:40.850 --> 00:41:44.550
-She makes me feel like a poet.
-You may feel like a poet...


437
00:41:44.770 --> 00:41:46.430
...but you sound like an idiot.

438
00:41:46.647 --> 00:41:49.565
-You don't even know her name.
-Her name?


439
00:41:51.360 --> 00:41:53.732
Her name is Aphrodite.

440
00:41:54.196 --> 00:41:57.695
Calypso. Venus. 
Take your pick.

441
00:42:02.371 --> 00:42:04.743
Women weaken the heart.

442
00:42:06.249 --> 00:42:08.871
Without your heart, you cannot win.

443
00:42:12.881 --> 00:42:14.957
-But her eyes--
-Concentrate.


444
00:42:15.216 --> 00:42:16.759
Tansy cakes!

445
00:42:19.554 --> 00:42:21.926
Count Adhemar sends word.

446
00:42:22.932 --> 00:42:26.384
He said he will win
this tournament for you.


447
00:42:27.270 --> 00:42:31.433
He's won many. He wins them
for himself and his own honor.


448
00:42:31.649 --> 00:42:34.057
It's nothing to say
he wins them for me.


449
00:42:36.070 --> 00:42:38.228
He wishes to speak to you again.

450
00:42:38.781 --> 00:42:40.857
Not to hear a word I say.

451
00:42:42.118 --> 00:42:44.490
Adhemar wants his women silent.

452
00:42:50.250 --> 00:42:53.500
Would you have Sir Ulrich
win the tournament for you?


453
00:42:53.754 --> 00:42:55.082
No.

454
00:42:56.298 --> 00:42:59.583
And he is the only knight
who has not promised to do so.


455
00:43:01.428 --> 00:43:04.133
Sir Ulrich von Lichtenstein.

456
00:43:04.931 --> 00:43:07.422
I would have him win my heart.

457
00:43:16.276 --> 00:43:19.775
Adhemar! Adhemar! Adhemar!

458
00:43:23.950 --> 00:43:25.610
Oh, lovely.

459
00:43:26.661 --> 00:43:30.160
I don't think I've ever seen
Count Adhemar lose.


460
00:43:30.623 --> 00:43:33.624
No, but defeat him
and you'll see it firsthand.


461
00:43:35.294 --> 00:43:36.788
My liege.

462
00:43:38.464 --> 00:43:39.958
Sir Ulrich.

463
00:43:41.967 --> 00:43:43.342
Christiana.

464
00:43:43.969 --> 00:43:47.967
-My lady bids you wear this token.
-Of course.


465
00:43:48.682 --> 00:43:51.303
She also said to tell you, her name...

466
00:43:53.311 --> 00:43:55.138
...is Jocelyn.

467
00:43:57.899 --> 00:43:59.393
-Au revoir.
-Au revoir.


468
00:44:01.277 --> 00:44:02.558
Oh, Jocelyn.

469
00:44:05.990 --> 00:44:07.650
Concentrate.

470
00:45:30.239 --> 00:45:31.733
I can't breathe.

471
00:45:39.581 --> 00:45:41.455
No style whatsoever.

472
00:45:42.917 --> 00:45:44.744
But neither has an anvil.

473
00:45:45.754 --> 00:45:50.083
-He hits like a hammer. Amazing.
-But not perfect. He aims high.


474
00:45:50.341 --> 00:45:53.093
Roll your shoulder back,
his blow may go right.


475
00:45:53.344 --> 00:45:56.345
But if he strikes to my left,
I'll be obliterated.


476
00:45:56.889 --> 00:45:58.681
I didn't say it wasn't a gamble.

477
00:46:39.305 --> 00:46:43.006
Ulrich! Ulrich! Ulrich! Ulrich!

478
00:47:34.525 --> 00:47:35.854
William?

479
00:47:43.701 --> 00:47:45.195
William, here.

480
00:47:46.704 --> 00:47:48.032
Come here.

481
00:47:57.089 --> 00:47:59.544
Someday I'll be a knight.

482
00:48:01.093 --> 00:48:03.382
A thatcher's son? A knight?

483
00:48:03.720 --> 00:48:06.555
You might as well try
to change the stars.


484
00:48:08.433 --> 00:48:10.260
Can it be done, Father?

485
00:48:10.560 --> 00:48:14.060
-Can a man change the stars?
-Yes, William.


486
00:48:14.356 --> 00:48:17.310
If he believes enough,
a man can do anything.


487
00:48:37.086 --> 00:48:38.461
Come here.

488
00:48:45.928 --> 00:48:48.419
Gain more bearing, Ulrich.

489
00:48:49.139 --> 00:48:51.132
See me again when you're worthy.

490
00:48:56.480 --> 00:48:58.307
I'll fong you in the arse!

491
00:48:59.608 --> 00:49:02.313
Well done, my lord! Well done.

492
00:49:02.611 --> 00:49:04.899
-You bastard!
-Go and see to Ulrich.


493
00:49:05.113 --> 00:49:06.940
Go see to Ulrich.

494
00:49:10.660 --> 00:49:12.285
Well done, my lord.

495
00:49:12.829 --> 00:49:14.453
A noble victory.

496
00:49:19.627 --> 00:49:23.162
My lady, I believe this is yours.

497
00:49:29.512 --> 00:49:32.133
For long spear on foot...

498
00:49:32.515 --> 00:49:35.006
...Pandolfo Malatesta.

499
00:49:40.147 --> 00:49:44.524
For sword on foot,
Ulrich von Lichtenstein.


500
00:49:49.197 --> 00:49:53.990
Finally, for the mounted joust
and tournament champion...


501
00:49:54.327 --> 00:49:57.162
...Adhemar, Count of Anjou.

502
00:49:58.832 --> 00:50:01.702
Adhemar! Adhemar! Adhemar!

503
00:50:04.337 --> 00:50:08.382
I present to you your champions.

504
00:50:13.221 --> 00:50:17.847
Next time, you will look up
at me from the flat of your back.


505
00:50:18.059 --> 00:50:22.103
Please. You have been weighed,
you have been measured...


506
00:50:22.355 --> 00:50:24.347
...and you have been found wanting.

507
00:50:32.364 --> 00:50:34.321
Keep winning the sword.

508
00:50:34.575 --> 00:50:36.947
-I won't compete in it.
-It's your best.


509
00:50:37.244 --> 00:50:39.865
No. It's tournament champion
or nothing at all.


510
00:50:45.377 --> 00:50:47.915
Ten florins. That should do.

511
00:50:50.757 --> 00:50:54.375
Sixes and sevens tonight, Chaucer.
Do you feel lucky?


512
00:50:54.719 --> 00:50:58.883
-Have you enough clothes?
-Be gone. I'm done with you.


513
00:50:59.724 --> 00:51:02.262
Except to exact my revenge.

514
00:51:04.729 --> 00:51:08.228
What on earth could you
possibly do to us?


515
00:51:08.608 --> 00:51:10.896
I will eviscerate you in fiction.

516
00:51:11.235 --> 00:51:14.569
Every last pimple,
every last character flaw.


517
00:51:14.947 --> 00:51:19.276
I was naked for a day.
You will be naked for eternity.


518
00:51:20.077 --> 00:51:22.568
I have a feeling we shall meet again.

519
00:51:25.416 --> 00:51:28.085
Here, farris, take what we owe you.

520
00:51:29.086 --> 00:51:33.249
The armor you wear, it wasn't
made for you, was it?


521
00:51:34.341 --> 00:51:35.800
So, what of it?

522
00:51:35.967 --> 00:51:38.921
I could make armor you wouldn't
even know you wore it.


523
00:51:39.179 --> 00:51:40.507
What's the cost?

524
00:51:42.098 --> 00:51:44.305
Just take me as far as Paris.

525
00:51:45.352 --> 00:51:48.222
We travel alone.
Take your gold and go.


526
00:51:56.654 --> 00:52:01.115
-Get what you can. Let's pack.
-Why are we leaving so soon?


527
00:52:01.450 --> 00:52:06.445
The next tournament is in a week.
We can walk now and save the horse.


528
00:52:06.831 --> 00:52:10.200
You must go to the banquet.
You'll dance and make an appearance.


529
00:52:10.459 --> 00:52:12.618
Let Adhemar laugh at me again?
No!


530
00:52:12.878 --> 00:52:14.871
-Yes!
-No!


531
00:52:21.136 --> 00:52:24.671
My lady would know the color
of your lord's tunic tonight.


532
00:52:25.307 --> 00:52:29.470
-His tunic?
-Yes, so she can dress to match him.


533
00:52:29.853 --> 00:52:33.388
We regret to inform your lady
he won't be attending--


534
00:52:33.648 --> 00:52:37.183
-Herald, do not give my answers!
-Yes, my lord.


535
00:52:37.402 --> 00:52:38.979
Squire, answer her.

536
00:52:39.362 --> 00:52:42.980
What color is my tunic tonight?

537
00:52:47.161 --> 00:52:48.537
Green.

538
00:52:50.706 --> 00:52:52.414
Trimmed in a kind of...

539
00:52:52.708 --> 00:52:54.500
...pale green...

540
00:52:56.337 --> 00:52:57.665
...with...

541
00:52:58.047 --> 00:53:00.170
...uh, wooden toggles.

542
00:53:01.842 --> 00:53:03.669
I will tell my lady.

543
00:53:10.184 --> 00:53:13.967
-This is a disaster!
-No, it'll tunic up quite nicely.


544
00:53:14.187 --> 00:53:16.180
That's not a disaster, Roland.

545
00:53:20.068 --> 00:53:21.693
I don't know how to dance.

546
00:53:24.197 --> 00:53:27.862
And one and two and three and four.

547
00:53:28.243 --> 00:53:31.528
Your hand should be light,
like a birdie on a branch.


548
00:53:31.871 --> 00:53:35.370
And one, two and three and four.

549
00:53:35.708 --> 00:53:38.875
And Wat doesn't lead,
he follows like a girl.


550
00:53:48.888 --> 00:53:52.054
And one and two and...

551
00:53:52.433 --> 00:53:54.057
...twirly, twirly, twirly.

552
00:53:54.435 --> 00:53:57.554
And one and two, and you're
still getting it wrong.


553
00:53:57.896 --> 00:54:01.597
And one and two
and three and four.


554
00:54:01.942 --> 00:54:05.228
You can hit me all day
because you punch like a what?


555
00:54:05.487 --> 00:54:06.768
A girl.

556
00:54:07.072 --> 00:54:09.065
-Enough!
-Get back! Wat, quiet!


557
00:54:09.616 --> 00:54:11.573
-He starts it.
-You know he's touchy!


558
00:54:14.120 --> 00:54:16.113
Oh, and you can do better?

559
00:54:16.581 --> 00:54:19.452
-Of course.
-Then show us.


560
00:54:20.543 --> 00:54:22.085
No.

561
00:54:23.755 --> 00:54:28.333
If I'm making all this effort,
you'd best ask her nicely.


562
00:54:32.930 --> 00:54:34.045
I'm sorry, Kate.

563
00:54:38.269 --> 00:54:42.266
I was wondering if you'd care
to show us how to dance.


564
00:54:43.399 --> 00:54:44.561
-Please.
-Please.


565
00:54:47.945 --> 00:54:51.444
And one and two, three and four.

566
00:54:51.824 --> 00:54:54.824
Five, six, seven, change partners.

567
00:54:55.119 --> 00:54:58.452
And one, two, three, four...

568
00:54:58.789 --> 00:55:01.244
...five, six, seven.

569
00:55:01.500 --> 00:55:03.326
Polonaise. And one....

570
00:55:04.211 --> 00:55:06.618
Are you wearing your hair like that?

571
00:55:07.714 --> 00:55:09.457
Is there another way?

572
00:55:38.536 --> 00:55:42.485
Sir Ulrich, you look fantastic.

573
00:55:45.501 --> 00:55:47.623
Jocelyn, you look....

574
00:55:50.213 --> 00:55:51.542
Uh, you...

575
00:55:54.968 --> 00:55:56.462
...remind me of the Bible.

576
00:56:02.142 --> 00:56:06.519
When God stopped the sun to give
Joshua time to defeat the Amorites.


577
00:56:10.191 --> 00:56:11.520
I don't understand.

578
00:56:16.531 --> 00:56:19.235
If I could ask God one thing...

579
00:56:19.867 --> 00:56:22.156
...it would be to stop the moon.

580
00:56:24.038 --> 00:56:26.908
Stop the moon and make this night...

581
00:56:28.209 --> 00:56:29.869
...and your beauty...

582
00:56:30.544 --> 00:56:32.252
...last forever.

583
00:56:34.381 --> 00:56:37.715
What dance will you have? A coranto?

584
00:56:38.719 --> 00:56:40.711
Or a basse dance?

585
00:56:41.722 --> 00:56:43.264
Sir Ulrich.

586
00:56:45.058 --> 00:56:48.178
Why don't you show us a dance
of your country?


587
00:56:48.937 --> 00:56:51.226
Show us a dance of Gelderland.

588
00:56:53.233 --> 00:56:55.391
Yes. Gelderland.

589
00:56:59.572 --> 00:57:02.407
Well, it's a lot like the farandole...

590
00:57:03.743 --> 00:57:06.578
...but with some differences.

591
00:57:07.747 --> 00:57:09.739
Well, you bow.

592
00:57:14.086 --> 00:57:15.628
And...

593
00:57:27.766 --> 00:57:28.929
...and....

594
00:57:42.989 --> 00:57:45.112
Places. Places.

595
01:00:54.800 --> 01:00:55.962
What?

596
01:00:57.302 --> 01:01:02.641
-I don't know. Too small, too light.
-He'll be crushed. Killed.


597
01:01:02.974 --> 01:01:07.601
No. I found a new way to heat steel.
It's thinner, smaller...


598
01:01:07.812 --> 01:01:09.472
...but just as strong.

599
01:01:09.773 --> 01:01:10.935
What are these?

600
01:01:11.316 --> 01:01:14.981
The marks of my trade should
another knight admire the armor.


601
01:01:17.530 --> 01:01:20.816
Twist and bend. 
Feel the movement.

602
01:01:22.452 --> 01:01:25.821
-But eventually I will be struck.
-And then death.


603
01:01:26.497 --> 01:01:29.202
Do you at least have the courage
to test it?


604
01:01:38.634 --> 01:01:39.630
You okay?

605
01:01:41.178 --> 01:01:42.838
I didn't feel a thing.

606
01:02:09.914 --> 01:02:12.868
-Who's that knight?
-Piers Courtenay.


607
01:02:13.167 --> 01:02:17.379
He's raised taxes on his land 3 times
this year to pay for tournament.


608
01:02:17.588 --> 01:02:20.423
His people starve while
he sits at banquet.


609
01:02:24.136 --> 01:02:25.844
It's probably true.

610
01:02:59.921 --> 01:03:03.206
Ulrich! Ulrich! Ulrich! Ulrich!

611
01:03:03.758 --> 01:03:06.379
Ulrich von Lichtenstein.

612
01:03:07.804 --> 01:03:09.381
The Count Adhemar...

613
01:03:10.056 --> 01:03:12.095
...son of Philippe de Vitry...

614
01:03:12.433 --> 01:03:14.591
...son of Gilles...

615
01:03:15.561 --> 01:03:17.055
...master of the free companies...

616
01:03:17.646 --> 01:03:20.517
...defender of his enormous manhood...

617
01:03:21.233 --> 01:03:23.771
...a shining example of chivalry...

618
01:03:24.069 --> 01:03:25.943
...and champagne.

619
01:03:30.409 --> 01:03:31.951
Nice work!

620
01:03:33.412 --> 01:03:34.740
Bravo!

621
01:03:38.208 --> 01:03:41.375
Watch every move Adhemar makes.
We'll find a weakness.


622
01:03:41.586 --> 01:03:43.246
Well, Colville looks fit.

623
01:03:43.588 --> 01:03:44.751
--my liege...

624
01:03:44.965 --> 01:03:47.752
...the second son of
Sir Wallace Percival.


625
01:03:47.967 --> 01:03:50.755
It is my deepest honor--

626
01:03:54.265 --> 01:03:56.507
My deepest honor to present to you....

627
01:03:57.310 --> 01:04:00.264
It's Edward, my lord.
They're sure of it.


628
01:04:03.316 --> 01:04:06.767
--the illustrious Sir Thomas Colville!

629
01:04:22.626 --> 01:04:24.286
Adhemar withdrew.

630
01:04:24.628 --> 01:04:27.166
To withdraw like that means one thing.

631
01:04:28.340 --> 01:04:29.454
Royalty.

632
01:04:39.851 --> 01:04:41.844
I'll see what I can find out.

633
01:04:43.646 --> 01:04:45.354
Prepare to drop the flag.

634
01:04:45.565 --> 01:04:48.400
No, no. Not yet. Wait, listen.

635
01:04:48.651 --> 01:04:50.311
Musicians, announce.

636
01:04:50.570 --> 01:04:54.021
-I must speak with my lord.
-Then go.


637
01:04:54.282 --> 01:04:56.820
See if you can beat the Second Coming.

638
01:04:57.827 --> 01:04:59.487
Wait! Wait!

639
01:05:01.247 --> 01:05:05.707
Colville is Edward, the Black
Prince, future king of England.


640
01:05:06.043 --> 01:05:08.332
He's in disguise like me
so he can compete.


641
01:05:08.545 --> 01:05:12.329
He's never met an enemy without
victory or town he couldn't defeat.


642
01:05:12.591 --> 01:05:14.584
We're English! 
We know who he is!

643
01:05:14.843 --> 01:05:18.212
-You must withdraw. Tell them, Geoff.
-Absolutely!


644
01:05:18.472 --> 01:05:19.385
The lance.

645
01:05:26.855 --> 01:05:28.183
Give me the lance.

646
01:05:35.697 --> 01:05:36.859
Lance!

647
01:05:51.045 --> 01:05:53.203
Oh, my giddy aunt.

648
01:05:57.551 --> 01:06:00.089
The match is a draw.

649
01:06:03.265 --> 01:06:05.803
You mad? You endanger
a royal family member.


650
01:06:06.310 --> 01:06:08.267
He endangers himself.

651
01:06:09.062 --> 01:06:11.553
Well fought, Sir Ulrich, as in Rouen.

652
01:06:13.567 --> 01:06:15.310
You also, Prince Edward.

653
01:06:20.657 --> 01:06:22.899
-You knew me?
-Yeah.


654
01:06:26.913 --> 01:06:28.111
And still you rode?

655
01:06:29.290 --> 01:06:33.288
-It's not in me to withdraw.
-No. Nor me.


656
01:06:35.838 --> 01:06:37.546
Though it happens.

657
01:06:39.926 --> 01:06:41.633
Yes, it does.

658
01:06:43.596 --> 01:06:46.762
-Good luck to you.
-You also.


659
01:06:49.310 --> 01:06:53.473
The winner of the mounted joust and
tournament champion...


660
01:06:53.772 --> 01:06:56.014
...Ulrich von Lichtenstein.

661
01:07:02.114 --> 01:07:05.447
-Melt it, sell it, do whatever you do.
-Yes, Your Majesty.


662
01:07:05.742 --> 01:07:06.905
You're champion!

663
01:07:07.119 --> 01:07:10.155
I'm not champion until
I defeat Adhemar. He withdrew.


664
01:07:10.455 --> 01:07:11.783
Sir Ulrich.

665
01:07:13.124 --> 01:07:16.956
-Tell me what you'll wear tonight.
-Nothing.


666
01:07:17.337 --> 01:07:20.124
We'll cause a sensation,
for I'll dress to match.


667
01:07:20.381 --> 01:07:22.919
Don't you get tired
of putting on clothes?


668
01:07:23.134 --> 01:07:25.625
She's talking about taking them off.

669
01:07:27.513 --> 01:07:30.467
A flower is only as good
as its petals, no?


670
01:07:30.850 --> 01:07:32.474
A flower is good for nothing.

671
01:07:34.979 --> 01:07:36.177
Really?

672
01:07:36.981 --> 01:07:40.017
You can't eat a flower.
lt doesn't keep you warm.


673
01:07:40.276 --> 01:07:43.727
And a rose never knocked
a man off a horse either, did it?


674
01:07:46.073 --> 01:07:48.778
You're just a silly girl, aren't you?

675
01:07:51.995 --> 01:07:56.871
Better a silly girl with a flower than
a silly boy with a horse and stick.


676
01:08:01.504 --> 01:08:02.833
Goodbye.

677
01:08:07.010 --> 01:08:09.002
It's called a lance.

678
01:08:09.387 --> 01:08:10.846
Hello.

679
01:08:42.377 --> 01:08:44.037
-I have word.
-What?


680
01:08:44.379 --> 01:08:47.214
Adhemar was called back
to the free companies.


681
01:08:47.549 --> 01:08:50.466
Edward commanded it.
He could be gone all season.


682
01:08:51.553 --> 01:08:54.388
First Jocelyn and now Adhemar.

683
01:09:00.061 --> 01:09:01.436
Well done.

684
01:09:01.729 --> 01:09:03.888
Yeah, well done.

685
01:09:14.575 --> 01:09:16.900
The tournament results, my lord.

686
01:09:29.923 --> 01:09:31.086
Ulrich.

687
01:09:31.925 --> 01:09:33.254
Ulrich.

688
01:09:34.094 --> 01:09:35.257
Ulrich.

689
01:09:54.280 --> 01:09:55.443
-Geoff.
-William.


690
01:09:56.282 --> 01:09:57.942
I need to write a letter.

691
01:09:58.534 --> 01:10:01.204
'' Dear Jocelyn.'' No.
'' My dearest Jocelyn.''


692
01:10:01.496 --> 01:10:02.871
Better.

693
01:10:06.542 --> 01:10:07.705
'' I miss you.''

694
01:10:08.878 --> 01:10:10.336
Was that wrong?

695
01:10:10.546 --> 01:10:15.208
Well, it's up to you, really.
It's your funeral, I mean, letter.


696
01:10:16.302 --> 01:10:19.137
-Say something about her breasts.
-You miss them.


697
01:10:19.972 --> 01:10:21.003
Her breasts?

698
01:10:22.224 --> 01:10:27.218
Yes, you could, but I would tend
to look above her breasts.


699
01:10:28.647 --> 01:10:30.355
I miss her throat?

700
01:10:30.565 --> 01:10:32.891
Still higher. Towards the heavens.

701
01:10:33.151 --> 01:10:35.986
The moon. Her breasts
weren't that impressive.


702
01:10:36.279 --> 01:10:38.486
The moon? The moon.

703
01:10:41.826 --> 01:10:43.700
'' lt is strange to think...

704
01:10:45.330 --> 01:10:47.488
...I have not seen you in a month.

705
01:10:50.168 --> 01:10:53.501
I have seen the
new moon, but not you.

706
01:10:55.673 --> 01:11:00.382
I have seen sunsets and sunrises, but
nothing of your beautiful face.''


707
01:11:04.682 --> 01:11:06.674
That's very good.

708
01:11:07.560 --> 01:11:10.015
I knew this girl once who....

709
01:11:11.355 --> 01:11:13.680
She broke my heart.
I said the pieces--


710
01:11:13.941 --> 01:11:18.602
''The pieces of my broken heart can
pass through the eye of a needle. ''


711
01:11:21.698 --> 01:11:23.774
He writes as though I had died.

712
01:11:24.034 --> 01:11:27.035
Yes, madame. He dies as well.

713
01:11:28.705 --> 01:11:31.374
She used to cook
for the Duke of York.

714
01:11:34.377 --> 01:11:37.746
I miss her like the sun
misses the flower.


715
01:11:38.214 --> 01:11:41.215
''I miss you like the sun
misses the flower.


716
01:11:41.926 --> 01:11:45.544
Like the sun misses the flower
in the depths of winter.


717
01:11:47.223 --> 01:11:50.426
Instead of beauty to direct
its light to...


718
01:11:51.060 --> 01:11:55.603
...the heart hardens like the frozen
world your absence has sent me to.''


719
01:11:55.898 --> 01:11:57.891
''I next compete in Paris.

720
01:11:58.943 --> 01:12:02.062
I'll find it empty and cold
if you're not there.''


721
01:12:03.238 --> 01:12:04.733
I like it.

722
01:12:05.574 --> 01:12:07.732
And now, to finish it.

723
01:12:09.119 --> 01:12:10.744
With '' hope.''

724
01:12:11.580 --> 01:12:13.738
Love should end with hope.

725
01:12:15.083 --> 01:12:17.918
My husband, God rest him...

726
01:12:18.336 --> 01:12:20.578
...said something I'll never forget.

727
01:12:22.424 --> 01:12:23.918
'' Hope guides me. lt--''

728
01:12:24.175 --> 01:12:27.675
''It gets me through the day and
especially the night.


729
01:12:28.763 --> 01:12:31.254
The hope that after you
leave my sight...


730
01:12:31.516 --> 01:12:34.303
...it will not be the last time
I look upon you.''


731
01:12:38.105 --> 01:12:39.813
Finish it with.:

732
01:12:40.483 --> 01:12:44.694
''With all the love
that I possess...William.''


733
01:12:46.155 --> 01:12:47.234
You mean '' Ulrich.''

734
01:12:49.700 --> 01:12:51.989
''With all the love I possess...

735
01:12:53.662 --> 01:12:55.489
...I remain yours...

736
01:12:56.373 --> 01:12:58.366
...the knight of your heart.''

737
01:13:07.342 --> 01:13:11.505
My master hoped you might have
something to send him in return.


738
01:13:26.319 --> 01:13:31.111
Cock-a-doodle once! I shall not deny
him. Twice! I shall not. Thrice!


739
01:13:31.908 --> 01:13:33.485
I deny him.

740
01:13:33.909 --> 01:13:35.285
Thrice he denied him!

741
01:13:41.375 --> 01:13:42.917
No Adhemar.

742
01:13:44.586 --> 01:13:45.785
No Adhemar.

743
01:13:51.468 --> 01:13:52.631
Wat.

744
01:13:55.764 --> 01:13:58.800
Tell me, did you see her?
Did she read the letter?


745
01:13:59.226 --> 01:14:01.218
Yes, and yes.

746
01:14:02.145 --> 01:14:03.094
And?

747
01:14:09.194 --> 01:14:10.652
She's coming to Paris!

748
01:14:14.282 --> 01:14:18.908
Did she give you anything for me in
return? A letter? A token?


749
01:14:19.537 --> 01:14:21.779
Did she give me a token? She did.

750
01:14:24.166 --> 01:14:25.495
Uh, I mean, um....

751
01:14:26.085 --> 01:14:28.790
Well, what is it? 
Give it to me.

752
01:14:37.596 --> 01:14:38.924
Yes!

753
01:14:41.308 --> 01:14:42.933
Hell, yes!

754
01:14:44.269 --> 01:14:48.101
She-- Because she's--
That means she-- Yeah!


755
01:14:51.943 --> 01:14:53.319
Cinquante.

756
01:14:54.446 --> 01:14:56.070
That's a nice round number.

757
01:14:56.823 --> 01:14:58.021
Ex cusez-moi.

758
01:15:01.744 --> 01:15:05.991
They wager that a Frenchman, not
Sir Ulrich, will win the tournament.


759
01:15:07.750 --> 01:15:09.458
But the amount is 50 florins.

760
01:15:09.711 --> 01:15:12.628
-That's all we got.
-lf we had 60, it would be that.


761
01:15:12.839 --> 01:15:15.329
Ulrich against every Frenchman here?

762
01:15:15.591 --> 01:15:19.292
He's won four tournaments in a row.
And Adhemar isn't here.


763
01:15:19.512 --> 01:15:22.512
I check shields too.
John Beaumont's here.


764
01:15:22.765 --> 01:15:26.383
Count Theobald, Philip of Burgundy--
all French champions.


765
01:15:26.644 --> 01:15:28.138
Englishmen will not win...

766
01:15:28.354 --> 01:15:30.145
...this French tournament.

767
01:15:30.522 --> 01:15:34.140
English legs are unsteady
on French soil.


768
01:15:36.653 --> 01:15:38.812
Shut your mouth, all right?

769
01:15:40.490 --> 01:15:44.867
Come on, Roland. It's a good bet.
Win and I can buy my own tavern.


770
01:15:45.203 --> 01:15:48.038
-I could write full-time.
-A forge for me.


771
01:15:48.331 --> 01:15:52.827
And because French wine
is too much for English bellies.


772
01:15:53.211 --> 01:15:58.122
Listen, I'm about this fonging close,
mate. I swear to God, Quasimodo!


773
01:15:58.716 --> 01:16:03.010
All I want is to go home, and I've
enough for that trip a hundred times.


774
01:16:03.346 --> 01:16:07.889
And most importantly, because
the pope himself is French!


775
01:16:10.519 --> 01:16:13.805
The pope may be French,
but Jesus is English. You're on.


776
01:16:14.857 --> 01:16:17.395
He won't lose with the princess
watching him.


777
01:16:17.651 --> 01:16:19.644
He's blond! He's pissed!

778
01:16:19.862 --> 01:16:24.570
He'll see you in the lists!
Lichtenstein! Lichtenstein!


779
01:16:24.825 --> 01:16:28.360
He's blond! He's tan!
He comes from Gelderland!


780
01:16:28.745 --> 01:16:30.738
He comes from Gelderland!

781
01:16:31.039 --> 01:16:33.910
Gelderland!

782
01:16:49.390 --> 01:16:53.388
-You think he will come?
-As sure as the sun will rise.


783
01:17:19.086 --> 01:17:20.912
You favor cathedrals.

784
01:17:23.590 --> 01:17:25.464
I come for confession.

785
01:17:28.762 --> 01:17:30.754
And the glass.

786
01:17:31.598 --> 01:17:34.931
A riot of color in a dreary,
gray world.


787
01:17:36.102 --> 01:17:37.596
Don't you think?

788
01:17:38.646 --> 01:17:40.271
It's beautiful.

789
01:17:44.444 --> 01:17:47.279
I feel the same about
the letter you sent.


790
01:17:50.157 --> 01:17:51.782
Speak to me.

791
01:17:52.451 --> 01:17:54.278
Speak those words.

792
01:17:56.497 --> 01:17:58.786
I will win this tournament for you.

793
01:17:59.583 --> 01:18:00.614
Excuse me?

794
01:18:00.834 --> 01:18:05.829
I'll win this tournament in your name.
I'll defeat each knight for you.


795
01:18:06.173 --> 01:18:11.131
Your beauty will be reflected in the
power of my arm and my horse's flanks.


796
01:18:12.179 --> 01:18:13.507
Wow.

797
01:18:14.639 --> 01:18:15.968
Really?

798
01:18:16.475 --> 01:18:18.800
Really? lts flanks?

799
01:18:22.147 --> 01:18:24.685
I wish to hear poetry, Ulrich.

800
01:18:26.151 --> 01:18:28.143
Well, I'm not ready.

801
01:18:30.029 --> 01:18:34.109
I am. Why must everything for
a woman be run on a man's schedule?


802
01:18:34.325 --> 01:18:37.824
Well, a man's day is fuller, and...

803
01:18:38.204 --> 01:18:41.205
...he has more demands on his time.

804
01:18:41.540 --> 01:18:43.533
-ls that so?
-Yes.


805
01:18:44.210 --> 01:18:45.372
Maybe.

806
01:18:46.712 --> 01:18:47.827
No?

807
01:18:48.172 --> 01:18:50.544
I demand poetry...

808
01:18:51.342 --> 01:18:54.011
...and when I want it.
And I want it now.


809
01:18:57.181 --> 01:18:58.675
Your breasts...

810
01:19:00.058 --> 01:19:02.514
...they're below your throat....

811
01:19:03.687 --> 01:19:07.850
Jocelyn, how may I prove
my love to you? How?


812
01:19:10.318 --> 01:19:13.853
-Do you ask in earnest?
-Yes.


813
01:19:17.700 --> 01:19:20.073
If you would prove your love...

814
01:19:20.745 --> 01:19:23.532
-...do your worst.
-My worst?


815
01:19:25.208 --> 01:19:26.536
What do you mean?

816
01:19:27.043 --> 01:19:31.870
Instead of winning to honor me
with your high reputation...


817
01:19:32.256 --> 01:19:35.043
...act against your character
and do badly.


818
01:19:35.384 --> 01:19:36.760
-Do badly?
-Lose.


819
01:19:37.011 --> 01:19:39.003
Losing proves that I'm a loser.

820
01:19:39.221 --> 01:19:42.756
Wrong. Losing is a much keener
test of your love.


821
01:19:43.058 --> 01:19:45.549
Losing would contradict
your self-love.


822
01:19:45.936 --> 01:19:49.387
It would show obedience
to your lover and not yourself!


823
01:19:49.690 --> 01:19:52.097
-Really?
-Woman, shh!


824
01:19:52.401 --> 01:19:56.897
Do not ''shh'' me and spare him!
Now be gone! Go!


825
01:20:00.033 --> 01:20:01.314
What is your answer?

826
01:20:05.080 --> 01:20:07.238
I will not lose.

827
01:20:12.086 --> 01:20:13.746
Then you do not love me.

828
01:20:27.476 --> 01:20:29.516
The Protector of ltalian Virginity.

829
01:20:30.813 --> 01:20:33.600
The Lance that thrilled France...

830
01:20:33.941 --> 01:20:36.313
...the Harasser of Paraser!

831
01:20:36.610 --> 01:20:39.279
He gave them hell at La Rochelle!

832
01:20:39.988 --> 01:20:42.776
The Enforcer of our Lord God!

833
01:20:43.659 --> 01:20:46.613
The one, the only...

834
01:20:47.496 --> 01:20:49.784
...Sir Ulrich...

835
01:20:50.123 --> 01:20:52.661
...von Lichtenstein!

836
01:20:59.424 --> 01:21:00.883
God, I'm good!

837
01:21:06.139 --> 01:21:08.427
His horse's flanks.

838
01:21:09.017 --> 01:21:12.017
Maybe where he comes from,
it means love.


839
01:21:23.989 --> 01:21:25.069
What are you doing?

840
01:21:25.449 --> 01:21:27.607
-Losing.
-I don't understand.


841
01:21:28.410 --> 01:21:29.442
Neither do l.

842
01:21:49.848 --> 01:21:51.390
He loves me.

843
01:21:54.477 --> 01:21:55.722
Are you blind?

844
01:21:56.646 --> 01:21:59.433
-Did you see the flag?
-I saw it, okay?


845
01:22:00.358 --> 01:22:01.982
I know.

846
01:22:02.360 --> 01:22:05.526
You're dropping behind
for a more dramatic victory.


847
01:22:07.823 --> 01:22:11.027
Look, Jocelyn told me to lose
to prove my love.


848
01:22:13.662 --> 01:22:16.449
-I'd rather you were blind.
-Don't be foolish, Will.


849
01:22:16.665 --> 01:22:20.829
-Each woman wants proof, that's all.
-Proof of what?


850
01:22:21.587 --> 01:22:23.793
Her legs weren't uncrossed
for nothing.


851
01:22:24.006 --> 01:22:28.502
-I haven't uncrossed her legs.
-Then why are we doing this?


852
01:22:28.844 --> 01:22:30.089
Because!

853
01:22:42.232 --> 01:22:43.607
Because...

854
01:22:45.193 --> 01:22:46.521
...I love her.

855
01:23:28.485 --> 01:23:32.352
-I'm going to lose everything!
-That's why it's called gambling.


856
01:23:33.573 --> 01:23:35.233
Pain! Here's your pain!

857
01:23:35.575 --> 01:23:37.733
It's very romantic, though.

858
01:23:38.286 --> 01:23:40.528
Are you a woman or a blacksmith?

859
01:23:40.914 --> 01:23:42.538
Sometimes I'm both.

860
01:23:42.749 --> 01:23:44.575
Ooh, that chafes!

861
01:23:44.917 --> 01:23:46.246
Put him down.

862
01:23:49.797 --> 01:23:52.751
No knight has distanced himself
with victories.


863
01:23:53.134 --> 01:23:57.760
If you win your remaining matches
and your opponents take key losses...


864
01:23:58.055 --> 01:24:00.546
...you could make the semis,
or the finals.


865
01:24:00.766 --> 01:24:04.550
-At least the armor's proven itself.
-And your love?


866
01:24:04.937 --> 01:24:07.143
Have you proven that yet?

867
01:24:09.942 --> 01:24:14.271
Wat, you remember church as a boy.
The fear, the passion.


868
01:24:15.280 --> 01:24:17.438
That's what she makes me feel.

869
01:24:18.283 --> 01:24:22.612
And for that, I say my rosary
to Jocelyn and no one else.


870
01:24:23.455 --> 01:24:25.946
William, that's blasphemous.

871
01:24:32.505 --> 01:24:34.296
Then may I burn in hell.

872
01:24:34.632 --> 01:24:35.830
Withdraw.

873
01:24:36.217 --> 01:24:38.459
Lose that way.
Take no more punishment.


874
01:24:39.011 --> 01:24:40.636
Oh, Roland.

875
01:24:46.519 --> 01:24:49.804
My lady sends this message.
If you love her--


876
01:24:50.189 --> 01:24:53.522
I know, I know. I must lose.
Isn't she watching?


877
01:24:53.859 --> 01:24:56.813
She says if you love her,
you won't lose again.


878
01:24:57.321 --> 01:25:00.820
She says if you love her,
you will win this tournament.


879
01:25:10.375 --> 01:25:13.826
There she is, the embodiment of love.
Your Venus.


880
01:25:14.087 --> 01:25:15.498
And how I hate her.

881
01:25:31.521 --> 01:25:36.147
-I don't understand women.
-Nor do I, but they understand us.


882
01:25:37.693 --> 01:25:39.353
Maybe not you.

883
01:25:51.457 --> 01:25:52.867
Yes!

884
01:25:53.584 --> 01:25:55.078
Women, eh?

885
01:26:18.608 --> 01:26:20.268
Forty-eight...

886
01:26:20.610 --> 01:26:21.985
...forty-nine...

887
01:26:22.278 --> 01:26:23.938
...and fifty.

888
01:26:24.238 --> 01:26:27.773
Thank you, gentlemen.
A pleasure doing business with you.


889
01:26:28.117 --> 01:26:31.901
Look us up if you're in London,
the World Championships, maybe.


890
01:26:32.121 --> 01:26:36.284
Don't look too sad.
Here, have a drink on me.


891
01:26:36.625 --> 01:26:41.583
He's quick, he's funny and
makes lots of money, Lichtenstein!


892
01:26:59.856 --> 01:27:02.014
Guinevere comes to Lancelot.

893
01:27:08.031 --> 01:27:10.023
Bed him well, my lady.

894
01:27:10.491 --> 01:27:12.033
Bed him well.

895
01:27:18.833 --> 01:27:20.541
We missed you at banquet.

896
01:27:22.128 --> 01:27:22.993
''We''?

897
01:27:27.716 --> 01:27:28.997
l.

898
01:27:30.511 --> 01:27:31.886
Jocelyn.

899
01:27:32.679 --> 01:27:34.339
Your prize.

900
01:27:36.350 --> 01:27:37.974
My prize.

901
01:27:40.228 --> 01:27:41.853
I am not worthy of a prize.

902
01:27:43.857 --> 01:27:45.565
Then who is?

903
01:27:47.194 --> 01:27:50.562
My maid tells me that
sometimes your varlets...


904
01:27:51.740 --> 01:27:53.020
...call you William.

905
01:27:56.536 --> 01:27:58.160
Is this so, Sir Ulrich?

906
01:28:01.541 --> 01:28:02.703
Yes.

907
01:28:04.544 --> 01:28:05.539
lt is so.

908
01:28:19.558 --> 01:28:22.393
Your name makes no matter to me.

909
01:28:24.396 --> 01:28:26.887
Just so I can call you my own.

910
01:28:28.192 --> 01:28:30.861
But Jocelyn, I am your own.

911
01:28:38.243 --> 01:28:39.951
Damn, girl.

912
01:28:40.787 --> 01:28:42.115
You need a surgeon.

913
01:28:42.414 --> 01:28:46.542
He's been. He says I will live,
though it doesn't feel that way.


914
01:28:48.127 --> 01:28:51.128
Oh, William. This pain is my doing.

915
01:28:51.464 --> 01:28:53.124
Yes, it is.

916
01:28:56.928 --> 01:28:58.256
Although...

917
01:28:59.096 --> 01:29:00.472
...my father...

918
01:29:02.933 --> 01:29:05.092
...taught me to take the bad...

919
01:29:06.145 --> 01:29:07.604
...with the good.

920
01:29:14.945 --> 01:29:16.938
This good you speak of.

921
01:29:19.783 --> 01:29:22.108
It will be my doing as well.

922
01:29:39.135 --> 01:29:43.512
How long since any of you have been
back? I've only been gone 6 months.


923
01:29:43.806 --> 01:29:45.633
Two years for me.

924
01:29:46.517 --> 01:29:47.798
Three years.

925
01:29:48.936 --> 01:29:52.471
Five. Five long years.

926
01:29:55.151 --> 01:29:56.479
William?

927
01:29:58.487 --> 01:29:59.650
Twelve.

928
01:30:01.490 --> 01:30:03.032
Twelve years.

929
01:30:05.619 --> 01:30:07.197
He's to be an apprentice?

930
01:30:12.000 --> 01:30:13.115
How long for?

931
01:30:14.711 --> 01:30:15.992
Seven years.

932
01:30:50.037 --> 01:30:51.697
Sir Ector?

933
01:30:53.082 --> 01:30:56.533
I'm the thatcher. I spoke to you
outside London Stadium.


934
01:30:56.877 --> 01:30:58.704
Oh, yes. I remember.

935
01:30:59.213 --> 01:31:00.755
Is this the boy?

936
01:31:04.051 --> 01:31:06.589
Step forward, son. 
Let me look at you.

937
01:31:07.054 --> 01:31:09.046
Careful with that, Roland!

938
01:31:14.561 --> 01:31:16.719
Are you afraid of me, boy?

939
01:31:27.073 --> 01:31:29.362
Have you got most of your teeth?

940
01:31:35.081 --> 01:31:37.239
Show me your arm. ls it strong?

941
01:31:47.468 --> 01:31:50.634
Well, he's a half-starved little
scarecrow.


942
01:31:51.930 --> 01:31:53.757
But he has spirit.

943
01:31:57.602 --> 01:32:02.145
I can show you a great wide world
full of adventure...


944
01:32:02.983 --> 01:32:05.937
...and marvels you
do not yet dream of.


945
01:32:08.613 --> 01:32:11.484
Can you pack my horse and lead it?

946
01:32:18.289 --> 01:32:21.456
Well, come on.
Say goodbye to your father.


947
01:32:23.127 --> 01:32:27.623
He's a real knight, William.
Watch and learn all you can.


948
01:32:33.345 --> 01:32:35.671
It's all I can do for you, son.

949
01:32:36.140 --> 01:32:40.137
Now go change your stars
and live a better life than I have.


950
01:32:51.029 --> 01:32:54.030
Roland, show the boy his duties.

951
01:32:57.702 --> 01:33:01.367
-Father? I'm afraid.
-Of what?


952
01:33:01.790 --> 01:33:03.782
I won't know the way home.

953
01:33:04.292 --> 01:33:08.124
Don't be foolish, William.
You just follow your feet.


954
01:33:27.356 --> 01:33:28.471
London.

955
01:34:15.861 --> 01:34:18.186
Give us a shout out, London!

956
01:34:40.218 --> 01:34:43.883
Ulrich! Ulrich! Ulrich! Ulrich!

957
01:35:21.258 --> 01:35:26.383
-Adhemar's here. He's entered.
-Must have grown bored with war.


958
01:35:26.596 --> 01:35:30.594
No, the Black Prince commanded it.
He had to disband his army.


959
01:35:30.851 --> 01:35:33.887
They were reveling,
pillaging town after town.


960
01:35:34.104 --> 01:35:36.974
Robbing, murdering,
ransacking churches.


961
01:35:37.273 --> 01:35:41.437
Committing the oldest sins
in the newest ways.


962
01:35:43.446 --> 01:35:46.482
At last we will face each other again,
Sir Ulrich.


963
01:35:46.783 --> 01:35:48.574
And at the World Championship.

964
01:35:48.785 --> 01:35:50.777
And as I promised you before...

965
01:35:51.120 --> 01:35:53.825
...you will look up at me
from the flat of your back.


966
01:35:59.670 --> 01:36:01.295
Let the past die.

967
01:36:02.298 --> 01:36:06.046
You've done well in my absence,
on the field and off, I'm told.


968
01:36:06.802 --> 01:36:10.337
Winning trophies, horses, women.

969
01:36:11.557 --> 01:36:13.264
You put them in that order?

970
01:36:13.976 --> 01:36:16.680
Generally, with a few exceptions.

971
01:36:23.693 --> 01:36:25.318
Beautiful, isn't she?

972
01:36:25.987 --> 01:36:29.190
A real thoroughbred trophy,
don't you think?


973
01:36:30.325 --> 01:36:34.239
-You speak of her like a target.
-Isn't she?


974
01:36:35.038 --> 01:36:36.200
No.

975
01:36:40.293 --> 01:36:41.751
She is the arrow.

976
01:36:45.881 --> 01:36:48.669
I've begun negotiations
with her father.


977
01:36:52.346 --> 01:36:54.173
I'm to make her my bride.

978
01:36:55.349 --> 01:36:57.840
She'll be saddled...

979
01:36:58.435 --> 01:37:00.677
...and placed on my mantle.

980
01:37:01.688 --> 01:37:03.764
Target or arrow, it doesn't matter.

981
01:37:04.691 --> 01:37:06.399
I will have her.

982
01:37:11.823 --> 01:37:14.112
Ulrich! Ulrich! Ulrich!

983
01:37:51.278 --> 01:37:55.145
-How would you beat him?
-With a stick, while he slept.


984
01:37:55.741 --> 01:37:58.445
But on a horse? With a lance?

985
01:37:59.244 --> 01:38:01.616
That man is unbeatable.

986
01:38:29.982 --> 01:38:31.145
Hello there.

987
01:38:34.278 --> 01:38:38.572
-You're Sir Ulrich von Lichtenstein.
-Yes.


988
01:38:39.033 --> 01:38:43.410
You're my favorite knight.
When we joust, I always say I'm you.


989
01:38:44.580 --> 01:38:48.198
What are you doing in Cheapside?
There's no parade today.


990
01:38:52.796 --> 01:38:54.420
Can you keep a secret?

991
01:39:09.979 --> 01:39:14.143
I was born in Cheapside,
just around the corner there.


992
01:39:14.484 --> 01:39:17.401
-Truly, Sir Ulrich?
-Truly.


993
01:39:17.695 --> 01:39:20.020
I only live just there.

994
01:39:21.741 --> 01:39:23.116
How old are you?

995
01:39:23.367 --> 01:39:26.534
-Nine and one half.
-Nine and one half.


996
01:39:27.204 --> 01:39:31.284
I wonder if you remember a man,
though he may have died long ago.


997
01:39:31.500 --> 01:39:35.165
He was as tall as a knight.
His name was John Thatcher.


998
01:39:35.504 --> 01:39:38.125
-Of course I remember him.
-You do?


999
01:39:38.340 --> 01:39:40.498
Yes. He lives there still.

1000
01:39:45.180 --> 01:39:49.178
Sometimes we see him sitting
at the window, but no one knows why.


1001
01:39:53.021 --> 01:39:54.100
What do you mean?

1002
01:39:54.689 --> 01:39:56.064
He's blind, sir.

1003
01:40:42.360 --> 01:40:43.938
Is someone there?

1004
01:40:48.741 --> 01:40:53.071
If you're here for the net,
I'm not done yet. Come tomorrow.


1005
01:40:57.375 --> 01:40:58.371
Who are you?

1006
01:41:01.420 --> 01:41:02.535
A knight.

1007
01:41:05.508 --> 01:41:08.627
My name...is Ulrich.

1008
01:41:09.887 --> 01:41:14.050
Ulrich? I hear that name
being chanted from the stadium.


1009
01:41:14.516 --> 01:41:16.390
What business have you here?

1010
01:41:16.894 --> 01:41:19.563
I have word, Master Thatcher.

1011
01:41:22.107 --> 01:41:23.138
Word of your son.

1012
01:41:24.401 --> 01:41:27.437
Of my William? 
Well, come in, sir.

1013
01:41:33.451 --> 01:41:36.785
What word? Does he live?

1014
01:41:39.165 --> 01:41:40.873
Aye. He lives.

1015
01:41:42.919 --> 01:41:44.579
He is very well.

1016
01:41:46.255 --> 01:41:48.129
He wanted you to know...

1017
01:41:49.967 --> 01:41:52.339
...that he changed his stars
after all.


1018
01:42:02.271 --> 01:42:04.643
And has he followed his feet?

1019
01:42:08.277 --> 01:42:10.898
Has he found his way home at last?

1020
01:42:12.364 --> 01:42:13.360
Yes.

1021
01:42:21.498 --> 01:42:22.613
Father.

1022
01:42:22.958 --> 01:42:25.793
Oh, William. Oh, my boy.

1023
01:42:36.721 --> 01:42:40.090
I should like to meet this Wat.
And Roland too.


1024
01:42:40.308 --> 01:42:42.300
You will, Father.

1025
01:42:45.354 --> 01:42:49.138
And what of women?
Is there a certain one or many?


1026
01:42:50.985 --> 01:42:52.693
There is a certain one.

1027
01:42:54.530 --> 01:42:56.487
I should like to meet her too.

1028
01:43:02.996 --> 01:43:05.322
This leak won't do, Father.

1029
01:43:05.916 --> 01:43:10.661
-Not in a thatcher's chamber.
-It's quite fitting for a blind one.


1030
01:43:13.006 --> 01:43:14.880
Well, a thatcher I am.

1031
01:43:16.551 --> 01:43:17.832
I'll fix it.

1032
01:44:02.345 --> 01:44:05.430
Alive. I thought he was dead,
which is mad...


1033
01:44:05.682 --> 01:44:08.932
...because he was also so strong.
Very strong.


1034
01:44:09.603 --> 01:44:11.560
-Geoff.
-Jocelyn.


1035
01:44:11.896 --> 01:44:14.352
This day just gets better and better.

1036
01:44:17.318 --> 01:44:18.481
Somebody die?

1037
01:44:21.739 --> 01:44:23.732
Sir Ulrich von Lichtenstein.

1038
01:44:27.453 --> 01:44:28.734
Adhemar...

1039
01:44:29.747 --> 01:44:33.246
...followed you last night.
To Cheapside.


1040
01:44:34.001 --> 01:44:35.329
He saw your father.

1041
01:44:36.587 --> 01:44:39.339
Will, they asked me for your patents.

1042
01:44:43.927 --> 01:44:47.213
They're waiting for you
in the lists to arrest you.


1043
01:44:48.098 --> 01:44:49.758
A dozen royal guards.

1044
01:44:50.934 --> 01:44:55.929
-They'll put you in the stocks.
-But I face Adhemar in five minutes.


1045
01:44:57.440 --> 01:45:01.272
No, you forfeit.
They've already marked it down.


1046
01:45:02.445 --> 01:45:05.779
Saddle the horses.
They can arrest your baggage, not you.


1047
01:45:11.955 --> 01:45:13.497
Halt.

1048
01:45:18.794 --> 01:45:20.502
So, what do you think...

1049
01:45:23.007 --> 01:45:24.916
...now that you know what I am?

1050
01:45:26.302 --> 01:45:30.465
To know what you are, William,
would take a lifetime.


1051
01:45:31.140 --> 01:45:33.975
One I am willing to give.
But now you must run.


1052
01:45:35.811 --> 01:45:38.136
Run, and I will run with you.

1053
01:45:38.480 --> 01:45:40.473
Jocelyn, I cannot run.

1054
01:45:40.816 --> 01:45:44.315
I am a knight, and I will
put myself to the hazard!


1055
01:45:44.695 --> 01:45:48.478
ln your heart, not on paper.
And paper's what matters to them!


1056
01:45:51.660 --> 01:45:53.782
William, I love you.

1057
01:45:55.830 --> 01:45:58.202
I love you. You.

1058
01:46:00.668 --> 01:46:05.247
-I won't see you led to the stocks.
-But you'll see me run? No!


1059
01:46:06.507 --> 01:46:08.500
Damn your pride, William.

1060
01:46:09.010 --> 01:46:11.845
It is only you that
will not see you run.


1061
01:46:12.096 --> 01:46:14.338
Pride's the one thing they can't take!

1062
01:46:14.598 --> 01:46:18.133
But they can take it from you.
They can and they will.


1063
01:46:18.894 --> 01:46:20.388
Oh, they will.

1064
01:46:21.188 --> 01:46:23.513
But love they cannot take.

1065
01:46:28.862 --> 01:46:31.187
And where will we live?

1066
01:46:32.366 --> 01:46:33.860
ln my hovel?

1067
01:46:35.577 --> 01:46:40.916
-With the pigs inside in winter?
-Yes, William, with the pigs.


1068
01:46:41.124 --> 01:46:42.453
With the pigs.

1069
01:46:45.545 --> 01:46:47.205
The poor can marry for love.

1070
01:46:49.048 --> 01:46:51.884
Jocelyn, you speak of what
you do not know!


1071
01:46:55.763 --> 01:46:57.756
William, I beg you.

1072
01:46:58.558 --> 01:46:59.886
Please.

1073
01:47:02.395 --> 01:47:04.138
Run. Do it for love.

1074
01:47:12.196 --> 01:47:13.904
Roland, you would see me run?

1075
01:47:20.913 --> 01:47:22.075
And you, Geoff?

1076
01:47:22.915 --> 01:47:25.785
I wish it too, with all
the pieces of my heart.


1077
01:47:32.090 --> 01:47:35.257
Wat? You and l? 
We aren't runners.

1078
01:47:39.931 --> 01:47:41.094
Yes.

1079
01:47:43.101 --> 01:47:44.844
William, today we are.

1080
01:47:48.272 --> 01:47:49.648
Run, William.

1081
01:47:56.447 --> 01:47:58.486
I will not run!

1082
01:48:05.789 --> 01:48:07.332
I am a knight.

1083
01:48:20.303 --> 01:48:21.632
Well, boys...

1084
01:48:22.222 --> 01:48:24.630
...all good things must come to an end.

1085
01:48:25.559 --> 01:48:27.468
Let's end them together.

1086
01:49:04.763 --> 01:49:08.381
You will remove yourself
from this position of honor.


1087
01:49:10.477 --> 01:49:11.805
I am here to compete.

1088
01:49:12.229 --> 01:49:14.601
You are here to be arrested.

1089
01:49:22.072 --> 01:49:23.400
All right!

1090
01:49:51.809 --> 01:49:54.430
He that strives to touch a star...

1091
01:49:55.312 --> 01:49:56.972
...oft stumbles...

1092
01:49:57.314 --> 01:49:58.974
...at a simple straw.

1093
01:50:09.951 --> 01:50:11.659
You have been weighed.

1094
01:50:19.294 --> 01:50:21.001
You have been measured.

1095
01:50:24.006 --> 01:50:25.714
And you have been found wanting.

1096
01:50:31.347 --> 01:50:34.301
It's one loss or another...William.

1097
01:50:40.397 --> 01:50:44.146
ln what world could you
have ever beaten me?


1098
01:51:22.438 --> 01:51:23.897
Leave, Roland.

1099
01:51:24.982 --> 01:51:26.311
Let them have me.

1100
01:51:27.318 --> 01:51:29.145
God love you, William.

1101
01:51:29.528 --> 01:51:30.939
So do I.

1102
01:51:31.530 --> 01:51:33.688
Go! Disperse!

1103
01:51:35.993 --> 01:51:37.617
Or I will fong you!

1104
01:51:38.203 --> 01:51:41.157
As Jesus Christ the Nazarene
and his holy mother...


1105
01:51:41.415 --> 01:51:44.949
...the Virgin Mary are my witnesses,
I will fong you!


1106
01:51:45.877 --> 01:51:48.582
I will rip you! Fist! Pain!

1107
01:51:48.964 --> 01:51:53.127
I'll stick my fist and break you!
Pain! Lots of pain!


1108
01:51:59.390 --> 01:52:00.801
We're in trouble.

1109
01:52:04.562 --> 01:52:06.222
Listen to me.

1110
01:52:10.902 --> 01:52:12.894
Listen to me!

1111
01:52:45.602 --> 01:52:47.974
What a pair we make, huh?

1112
01:52:51.483 --> 01:52:53.605
Both trying to hide who we are.

1113
01:52:54.944 --> 01:52:56.273
Both unable to do so.

1114
01:53:05.288 --> 01:53:07.114
Your men love you.

1115
01:53:09.291 --> 01:53:12.458
If I knew nothing else about you,
that would be enough.


1116
01:53:14.004 --> 01:53:17.788
But you also tilt
when you should withdraw.


1117
01:53:20.302 --> 01:53:22.211
That is knightly too.

1118
01:53:30.479 --> 01:53:31.677
Release him.

1119
01:53:41.656 --> 01:53:44.657
He may appear to be
of humble origins...


1120
01:53:45.910 --> 01:53:48.994
...but my personal historians
have discovered...


1121
01:53:49.330 --> 01:53:52.948
...that he descends
from an ancient royal line.


1122
01:53:56.337 --> 01:53:58.045
This is my word.

1123
01:53:59.507 --> 01:54:03.006
And as such, is beyond contestation.

1124
01:54:08.349 --> 01:54:09.297
Now...

1125
01:54:10.684 --> 01:54:14.018
...if I may repay the kindness
you once showed me.


1126
01:54:15.355 --> 01:54:16.351
Take a knee.

1127
01:54:33.414 --> 01:54:37.412
By the power vested in me
by my father, King Edward...


1128
01:54:38.586 --> 01:54:41.042
...and by all the witnesses here...

1129
01:54:44.217 --> 01:54:45.545
...I dub thee...

1130
01:54:48.262 --> 01:54:49.543
...Sir William.

1131
01:55:01.817 --> 01:55:04.390
Arise...Sir William.

1132
01:55:11.785 --> 01:55:13.065
Can you joust?

1133
01:55:14.746 --> 01:55:16.739
There's my tournament to finish.

1134
01:55:17.249 --> 01:55:21.745
Now, are you fit to compete,
or shall the forfeit stand?


1135
01:55:22.587 --> 01:55:23.536
I'm fit.

1136
01:55:24.923 --> 01:55:29.834
I shall have your opponent informed.
Look for his shield on the lists.


1137
01:55:30.428 --> 01:55:31.756
At once.

1138
01:55:32.430 --> 01:55:33.841
Thank you, my lord.

1139
01:55:44.316 --> 01:55:46.772
All hail Prince Edward!

1140
01:55:51.782 --> 01:55:54.107
My lords, my ladies...

1141
01:55:54.993 --> 01:55:57.449
...and all you other people.

1142
01:55:58.288 --> 01:56:02.997
I give you the son of Philippe
de Vitry, son of Gilles....


1143
01:56:05.629 --> 01:56:07.621
-Are you sure?
-Yes.


1144
01:56:08.340 --> 01:56:11.341
It's nothing but spun sugar
and boot black.


1145
01:56:20.310 --> 01:56:21.887
It's a small target...

1146
01:56:23.646 --> 01:56:25.306
...but aim for his heart.

1147
01:56:31.487 --> 01:56:33.729
--doer of daring deeds...

1148
01:56:34.990 --> 01:56:38.359
...conqueror of countless kingdoms,
Count...


1149
01:56:42.164 --> 01:56:43.824
...Adhemar!

1150
01:58:28.976 --> 01:58:30.968
Oh, God. I'll get the surgeon.

1151
01:58:31.270 --> 01:58:32.301
Roland!

1152
01:58:32.855 --> 01:58:34.053
You're the surgeon.

1153
01:58:36.483 --> 01:58:37.598
Come on.

1154
01:58:45.367 --> 01:58:46.446
He tipped it.

1155
01:58:49.287 --> 01:58:51.445
Kate, get me back to one.

1156
01:58:51.831 --> 01:58:53.788
Otherwise we forfeit.

1157
01:59:00.965 --> 01:59:03.123
Dirty son of a bitch!

1158
02:00:13.368 --> 02:00:16.702
Kate, I can't breathe.
I can't breathe.


1159
02:00:23.378 --> 02:00:25.536
As I said, thatcher.

1160
02:00:27.757 --> 02:00:30.711
In what world could you
have ever beaten me?


1161
02:00:31.386 --> 02:00:33.343
Such a place does not exist.

1162
02:00:35.765 --> 02:00:37.473
She's here William.

1163
02:00:39.644 --> 02:00:40.723
With your father.

1164
02:00:45.233 --> 02:00:46.810
Change your stars.

1165
02:00:51.864 --> 02:00:53.655
Let's dance, you and I.

1166
02:00:57.411 --> 02:00:59.119
It's two lances to none.

1167
02:00:59.413 --> 02:01:03.078
You must unhorse him or kill him.
It's the only way to win.


1168
02:01:13.093 --> 02:01:15.963
-You need more padding.
-No, leave it off.


1169
02:01:16.596 --> 02:01:18.256
I can't breathe with it on.

1170
02:01:23.937 --> 02:01:25.051
Lance.

1171
02:01:30.485 --> 02:01:32.027
I can barely grip it.

1172
02:01:32.278 --> 02:01:33.607
Damn.

1173
02:01:40.286 --> 02:01:41.614
Lash it to my arm.

1174
02:01:45.791 --> 02:01:46.989
Wat...

1175
02:01:47.710 --> 02:01:49.252
...lash it to me arm.

1176
02:01:52.423 --> 02:01:53.454
Do it.

1177
02:02:11.733 --> 02:02:13.275
Good people!

1178
02:02:14.319 --> 02:02:15.647
I missed my introduction!

1179
02:02:26.831 --> 02:02:28.491
But please...

1180
02:02:28.833 --> 02:02:30.493
...please, I pray you.

1181
02:02:31.002 --> 02:02:32.496
Hear it now.

1182
02:02:33.879 --> 02:02:35.837
For I would lay rest...

1183
02:02:36.173 --> 02:02:38.498
...the grace in my tongue...

1184
02:02:38.843 --> 02:02:40.503
...and speak plain.

1185
02:02:41.679 --> 02:02:43.505
Days like these...

1186
02:02:43.847 --> 02:02:47.512
...are far too rare to cheapen
with heavy-handed words.


1187
02:02:48.852 --> 02:02:52.720
And so, I'm afraid,
without any ado whatsoever--


1188
02:02:53.357 --> 02:02:54.732
Excuse me, my lord.

1189
02:02:55.192 --> 02:02:58.525
Here he is! One of your own!

1190
02:02:59.529 --> 02:03:02.447
Born a stone's throw from
this very stadium...


1191
02:03:02.782 --> 02:03:04.609
...and here before you now.

1192
02:03:04.951 --> 02:03:06.944
The son of John Thatcher...

1193
02:03:07.954 --> 02:03:10.955
...Sir William Thatcher!

1194
02:03:22.093 --> 02:03:23.124
That's your name.

1195
02:03:26.097 --> 02:03:28.089
Sir William Thatcher.

1196
02:03:28.891 --> 02:03:30.302
Your father heard that.

1197
02:03:48.410 --> 02:03:50.118
Godspeed, William.

1198
02:05:02.106 --> 02:05:04.811
William!

1199
02:05:25.838 --> 02:05:27.830
You have been weighed.

1200
02:05:29.299 --> 02:05:30.497
You've been measured.

1201
02:05:33.678 --> 02:05:35.837
And you absolutely...

1202
02:05:36.514 --> 02:05:38.174
...have been found wanting.

1203
02:05:42.353 --> 02:05:44.180
Welcome to the new world.

1204
02:05:44.731 --> 02:05:48.230
God save you, if it is right
that he should do so.


1205
02:05:54.824 --> 02:05:56.947
William!

1206
02:06:11.090 --> 02:06:12.750
Yes!

1207
02:06:14.176 --> 02:06:15.754
He's won! He's won!

1208
02:06:50.836 --> 02:06:52.496
You beat him, Will!

1209
02:06:57.176 --> 02:06:58.587
Oh, William.

1210
02:07:19.197 --> 02:07:21.190
I'm going to write this story.

1211
02:07:21.491 --> 02:07:23.484
About the prince and the knights?

1212
02:07:23.743 --> 02:07:28.701
No, all of it. All human activity
lies within the artist's scope.


1213
02:07:31.209 --> 02:07:33.036
Maybe not yours.

1214
02:07:35.209 --> 02:07:42.036
Resync: Xenzai[NEF]

1215
02:12:05.933 --> 02:12:07.096
Your round.

1216
02:12:07.372 --> 02:12:09.217
Resync: Xenzai[NEF]
