2
00:00:57.045 --> 00:01:01.258
We would say,
Ous se trouve les restaurant sais predict?


3
00:01:01.425 --> 00:01:04.886
Ous se trouve les restaurant sais predict?

4
00:01:05.804 --> 00:01:08.599
Very good... And if we wanted to know.

5
00:01:09.057 --> 00:01:11.518
Stretch... and lift.

6
00:01:14.187 --> 00:01:17.357
And greet them. 
And greet them.

7
00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:20.235
And say hello again.

8
00:02:39.981 --> 00:02:41.817
Come on bay, come over here.

9
00:02:49.324 --> 00:02:50.867
You do your Goddamn job!

10
00:02:51.159 --> 00:02:54.871
You tell that mother fucker he owes me $75
for this and to brush his Goddamn teeth!


11
00:02:56.248 --> 00:02:57.833
Fucking cocksucker.

12
00:03:03.255 --> 00:03:05.173
Avoid guys in baseball caps
because they're broke.


13
00:03:05.215 --> 00:03:07.455
And they spend the entire time
trying to finger-fuck you.


14
00:03:11.596 --> 00:03:12.889
Stupid ass.

15
00:03:17.185 --> 00:03:18.437
What are you covering up?

16
00:03:20.021 --> 00:03:22.858
Oh I just have uhh... these...

17
00:03:23.358 --> 00:03:24.358
spider bites.

18
00:03:24.693 --> 00:03:26.194
You got bite in here?

19
00:03:26.361 --> 00:03:27.529
Let me see.

20
00:03:29.406 --> 00:03:30.949
Where? I don't see anything.

21
00:03:31.658 --> 00:03:34.911
Well they're... it's better now,
they were worse before


22
00:03:36.455 --> 00:03:38.623
- Can you tighten this for me?
- Yeah


23
00:03:42.085 --> 00:03:43.545
Do it tight.

24
00:03:43.587 --> 00:03:45.505
Make it look like I don't
eat bread and shit...


25
00:03:47.591 --> 00:03:49.092
Girl I swear I stopped dancing Vegas

26
00:03:49.134 --> 00:03:50.844
so I wouldn't have to
deal with these bastards.


27
00:03:50.886 --> 00:03:52.926
You know
I danced for a guy tonight in a wheelchair,


28
00:03:53.263 --> 00:03:55.682
said it was his birthday
and he was gonna fuck me in the ass.


29
00:03:56.099 --> 00:03:58.769
I swear to Christ, all men
are the fucking same.


30
00:03:59.269 --> 00:04:01.349
Too bad these mother fuckers don't know
I like pussy.


31
00:04:02.731 --> 00:04:03.732
Stupid ass.

32
00:04:04.399 --> 00:04:07.569
- You not finished?
- Yeah, here ya go.


33
00:04:08.862 --> 00:04:10.113
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.


34
00:04:11.406 --> 00:04:12.532
You're new here right?

35
00:04:12.574 --> 00:04:13.574
Yeah.

36
00:04:15.911 --> 00:04:16.953
So what's your name?

37
00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:18.579
Venus.

38
00:04:19.039 --> 00:04:21.166
- You're real name, bitch.
- It's Venus.


39
00:04:21.792 --> 00:04:23.668
Oh well I'm Jupitor, nice to meet you.

40
00:04:24.836 --> 00:04:25.962
I'm just fucking with you.

41
00:04:26.004 --> 00:04:28.715
I'm Chanel. Well, Bethany,
but fuck that right?


42
00:04:29.132 --> 00:04:31.760
Ain't nobody trying to buy no dance
from no batch named Bethany.


43
00:04:34.638 --> 00:04:36.181
You must clean up in here?

44
00:04:36.848 --> 00:04:37.974
I do ok.

45
00:04:38.683 --> 00:04:39.810
What's ok?

46
00:04:39.935 --> 00:04:42.896
Like 100 to 200 a night, maybe.

47
00:04:43.605 --> 00:04:44.940
That's fucking ridiculous.

48
00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:47.484
You might as well wait goddamn tables
in this bitch.


49
00:04:47.692 --> 00:04:49.402
No stripper should be hurting for a cash.

50
00:04:49.444 --> 00:04:52.684
Do you know you can make just as much as
an attorney if you play your cards right?


51
00:04:53.406 --> 00:04:54.950
So what's your game?

52
00:04:56.618 --> 00:05:01.248
Ummm, I walk around the room
and if somebody wants a dance then


53
00:05:02.749 --> 00:05:04.835
No, no nah... Stop right there,
I'm gonna help you...


54
00:05:06.586 --> 00:05:07.666
Cause you on that bullshit.

55
00:05:08.129 --> 00:05:10.882
This is a sales job,
you have to know how to work these guys.


56
00:05:11.341 --> 00:05:13.927
Don't talk about their job, or
their family, their little kids,


57
00:05:13.969 --> 00:05:16.096
their boring-ass reality,
don't nobody want to hear that shit.


58
00:05:16.137 --> 00:05:18.098
You have to keep it all in fantasy.

59
00:05:18.139 --> 00:05:21.184
Talk about the new lotion you're wearing,
the new lingerie you just bought,


60
00:05:21.226 --> 00:05:22.769
the hot chick you just made outwith.

61
00:05:22.811 --> 00:05:24.011
Whatever, I don't give a shit.

62
00:05:24.312 --> 00:05:26.898
You just have to be dripping with sex.

63
00:05:27.148 --> 00:05:30.944
Because once you have a man turned on,
that's when you can take all of his money.


64
00:05:30.986 --> 00:05:33.738
Scan the room, find a
guy, lock eyes with him


65
00:05:33.905 --> 00:05:36.241
and stare at him like he's the only fucker
in the goddamn room


66
00:05:36.283 --> 00:05:39.202
and then you empty his fucking wallet.
You got it?


67
00:05:40.161 --> 00:05:41.161
Got it.

68
00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:42.830
Good.

69
00:06:39.471 --> 00:06:41.348
I'm just waiting for the
next song to start.


70
00:06:41.932 --> 00:06:44.059
And then... and then I'll dance for you.

71
00:06:45.727 --> 00:06:46.770
<i>OK.</i>

72
00:06:52.067 --> 00:06:53.818
Do you want to know
what I did last week?

73
00:06:54.861 --> 00:06:56.237
What did you do?

74
00:06:57.155 --> 00:06:59.032
I made outwith my friend Sophia.

75
00:06:59.741 --> 00:07:00.742
Really?

76
00:07:01.034 --> 00:07:08.416
Yep. And she's a... super model.
From Italy.


77
00:07:09.125 --> 00:07:13.838
And... it was really hot because
I've always wanted to do that.


78
00:07:17.050 --> 00:07:18.760
God you look like my wife.

79
00:07:20.178 --> 00:07:23.014
Oh... Ok.

80
00:07:23.264 --> 00:07:25.600
I'm sorry. That was...
that was a bit weird.


81
00:07:27.769 --> 00:07:29.187
- It's just...
- It's 0k.


82
00:07:29.562 --> 00:07:34.317
It's just amazing. You have the same eyes,
the same mouth, the hair.


83
00:07:35.068 --> 00:07:37.195
The only thing different
was she was a blonde.


84
00:07:39.239 --> 00:07:42.450
Oh, are you guys not together anymore?

85
00:07:44.119 --> 00:07:45.495
No. We're not.

86
00:07:45.537 --> 00:07:46.537
Why?

87
00:07:46.788 --> 00:07:50.333
I mean, urn, if it's too personal
it's okay, you don't have to tell me.


88
00:07:50.583 --> 00:07:54.045
It's... it's ok... She died.

89
00:07:56.214 --> 00:07:58.758
Oh my God, I'm so sorry.
L... l didn't know.


90
00:07:58.800 --> 00:08:01.594
It's... it's ok. It's ok.
I'm sorry, it's...


91
00:08:03.221 --> 00:08:04.764
I'm obviously not very good at this.

92
00:08:05.306 --> 00:08:06.391
That's 0k.

93
00:08:07.017 --> 00:08:09.144
- Maybe I should just sort of leave...
- No.


94
00:08:09.269 --> 00:08:10.979
- Then come back and start again.
- No.


95
00:08:11.021 --> 00:08:12.147
No?

96
00:08:12.856 --> 00:08:15.608
- No, no don't do that, stay.
- Ok.


97
00:08:15.734 --> 00:08:18.028
Yeah, I like you here, actually.

98
00:08:24.993 --> 00:08:28.621
I was born in New York City.
I love dark chocolate.


99
00:08:29.581 --> 00:08:33.001
And my left foot is half a size
bigger than the right.


100
00:08:33.084 --> 00:08:35.045
Done... Check!

101
00:08:35.086 --> 00:08:36.087
Oh.

102
00:08:37.505 --> 00:08:38.381
I should never have told you.

103
00:08:38.423 --> 00:08:40.263
I know, you should not
have ever have told me.


104
00:08:42.969 --> 00:08:47.974
So, why on earth would you leave
an exotic place like Australia?


105
00:08:48.058 --> 00:08:50.977
Exotic? I don't know about that?

106
00:08:51.019 --> 00:08:52.062
Hmm.

107
00:08:52.437 --> 00:08:55.106
Look, I never really planned
on leaving Australia.


108
00:08:55.190 --> 00:08:57.442
I uhh... l got a shoot out here.

109
00:08:57.484 --> 00:08:59.903
I'm a photographer, and uhh... l...

110
00:09:01.863 --> 00:09:04.908
I fell in love, I got
married and, I don't know.


111
00:09:05.575 --> 00:09:09.370
Yeah... So you're a photographer?

112
00:09:09.996 --> 00:09:11.164
Urn hm.

113
00:09:12.499 --> 00:09:17.045
Ok, well... Maybe you'd like
to take my picture sometime?


114
00:09:18.254 --> 00:09:20.799
I guess this means
we'd have to see each other again then.


115
00:09:20.840 --> 00:09:26.721
Umm, yeah... That sounds like a good idea.

116
00:10:33.830 --> 00:10:34.706
Hi.

117
00:10:34.747 --> 00:10:35.747
Hi.

118
00:10:37.041 --> 00:10:38.209
You look amazing.

119
00:10:40.336 --> 00:10:41.336
Thank you.

120
00:10:42.422 --> 00:10:43.840
I hope you like dark chocolate.

121
00:10:45.466 --> 00:10:47.051
Um, why don't you come in.

122
00:10:47.594 --> 00:10:48.678
Thank you.

123
00:10:50.013 --> 00:10:52.807
Wow, looks like another world in here.

124
00:10:53.808 --> 00:10:55.059
That's the point.

125
00:10:56.936 --> 00:10:59.063
L...made us a cheese plate,

126
00:10:59.105 --> 00:11:02.901
with some strawberries and, um some wine,

127
00:11:04.152 --> 00:11:08.406
I, I didn't know...
if may be you wanted some right away,


128
00:11:08.698 --> 00:11:11.826
or... if maybe you wanted some...

129
00:12:17.600 --> 00:12:22.397
So have you had a girlfriend?
Since, ya know...


130
00:12:26.734 --> 00:12:30.571
A few short-lived things.
But nothing really.


131
00:12:36.119 --> 00:12:38.204
Can I ask you
what your wife's name was?

132
00:12:40.915 --> 00:12:42.083
It was Victoria.

133
00:12:46.337 --> 00:12:50.091
How did... she? 
I'm sorry I...

134
00:12:50.258 --> 00:12:52.010
No, it's 0k, it's ok.

135
00:12:55.430 --> 00:12:56.723
She killed herself.

136
00:13:01.436 --> 00:13:02.436
What happened?

137
00:13:03.938 --> 00:13:05.231
She uhh...

138
00:13:09.152 --> 00:13:13.614
She uhh, she cut
her wrists... in the bath.

139
00:13:15.408 --> 00:13:17.827
By the time I got
there it was too late.

140
00:13:18.369 --> 00:13:20.455
There was no point in
taking her to the hospital.


141
00:13:22.790 --> 00:13:24.834
She was very depressed.

142
00:13:26.002 --> 00:13:29.964
Ya know she would... she would go to bed
early, she would sleep all the time, ya know?


143
00:13:31.257 --> 00:13:32.967
We wouldn't talk at dinner.

144
00:13:34.427 --> 00:13:37.555
She stopped doing the things
she sort of loved to do.


145
00:13:39.307 --> 00:13:45.021
She quit her job and...
and in a way it felt like she quit me...


146
00:13:48.441 --> 00:13:53.988
Like I'd come home from work and...
there she'd be... in a white slip,


147
00:13:55.114 --> 00:13:56.407
with a book in her hand,

148
00:13:57.158 --> 00:13:58.785
but not really reading it...

149
00:14:03.539 --> 00:14:06.417
Ya know, so we ya know,
went to a couples therapy they,


150
00:14:06.459 --> 00:14:08.669
they diagonosed her with depression.

151
00:14:10.004 --> 00:14:13.216
And then I got
a job offer in Madrid.

152
00:14:16.677 --> 00:14:23.101
And I uhh... l cheated on
her, with some intern,


153
00:14:24.060 --> 00:14:26.020
I...can't even remember
the name of her ya know?


154
00:14:28.147 --> 00:14:29.690
When I got back she was dead.

155
00:14:32.819 --> 00:14:34.529
It's not your fault, Brian.

156
00:14:36.697 --> 00:14:38.157
I shouldn't have left her.

157
00:14:44.580 --> 00:14:46.499
Are you scared of loving again?

158
00:14:51.003 --> 00:14:52.380
Not anymore.

159
00:15:52.398 --> 00:15:55.234
Doesn't even know what you fucking said!

160
00:16:18.591 --> 00:16:19.591
Hey.

161
00:16:19.842 --> 00:16:20.968
Hey handsome.

162
00:17:05.638 --> 00:17:06.638
Whoa...

163
00:17:13.229 --> 00:17:14.229
Babe“.

164
00:17:18.067 --> 00:17:20.736
Sweetheart, sweetheart,
wait a second, wait a second...


165
00:17:25.491 --> 00:17:26.909
I'm sorry, I'm just...

166
00:17:28.035 --> 00:17:30.830
I just had a long day, ya know?
I haven't eaten much.


167
00:17:32.373 --> 00:17:36.586
Well, what if I make you some of that
fusilli pasta that you like.


168
00:17:41.674 --> 00:17:42.674
Babe“.

169
00:17:47.054 --> 00:17:48.556
I think I just gotta go to sleep.

170
00:17:53.769 --> 00:17:54.769
<i>OK.</i>

171
00:18:50.284 --> 00:18:52.745
Hey, it's me. I just got back.

172
00:18:53.120 --> 00:18:55.414
Crazy trip, I have
so much to tell you.

173
00:18:55.915 --> 00:19:00.586
Anyway, umm, I've been thinking about you
and I'd love to see you,


174
00:19:00.961 --> 00:19:02.797
so give me a
call when you can. Bye.

175
00:19:16.644 --> 00:19:17.937
Red is so nice.

176
00:19:18.270 --> 00:19:19.605
Yeah, it's soft too.

177
00:19:19.647 --> 00:19:21.774
It's good quality. 
It will last you.

178
00:19:21.816 --> 00:19:24.235
Everything in your shop is good quality,
I love coming here.


179
00:19:24.860 --> 00:19:26.260
How long have you been coming here?

180
00:19:26.487 --> 00:19:27.613
Since you've been open.

181
00:19:28.489 --> 00:19:31.909
And you can't stop me... l want these too,
they're very soft.


182
00:19:32.660 --> 00:19:38.124
Uhh, don't look now but...
that Venus chick, is here.


183
00:19:40.167 --> 00:19:42.753
You know, I heard
she was a ballet dancer

184
00:19:42.837 --> 00:19:43.838
In like Paris or something

185
00:19:43.879 --> 00:19:45.589
Yeah, yeah, yeah, and she got kicked out.

186
00:19:45.673 --> 00:19:47.466
I wonder why do you think? Why?

187
00:19:47.883 --> 00:19:49.510
And now she's like a stripper.

188
00:19:50.219 --> 00:19:52.012
Venus cannot be her real name.

189
00:19:52.638 --> 00:19:54.014
She came in here drunk one time.

190
00:19:54.181 --> 00:19:55.725
- In the store?
- In the store.


191
00:19:56.225 --> 00:19:57.143
You should have kicked her out.

192
00:19:57.184 --> 00:19:58.185
It was crazy what was I gonna do?

193
00:19:58.310 --> 00:20:00.030
I can't just kick
somebody out of my store.

194
00:20:09.989 --> 00:20:11.907
But that's a really good
gift for your neice.


195
00:20:11.949 --> 00:20:15.161
Yeah, she started journaling and so I,
I want to encourage that, ya know?


196
00:20:15.202 --> 00:20:17.705
I mean, kids these day,
if you can get them writing


197
00:21:56.637 --> 00:21:57.637
Hello.

198
00:21:58.597 --> 00:22:06.522
I'm so alone... Lonely.

199
00:22:07.565 --> 00:22:15.565
I miss you baby. 
I miss you so.

200
00:22:16.073 --> 00:22:24.073
I miss you baby. I could die.

201
00:23:01.994 --> 00:23:03.037
How is it?

202
00:23:05.122 --> 00:23:06.373
It's great. It's great.

203
00:23:07.333 --> 00:23:08.375
Hmm, good.

204
00:23:12.880 --> 00:23:14.381
I got you something today...

205
00:23:17.343 --> 00:23:18.703
But you have to close your eyes...

206
00:23:19.887 --> 00:23:21.055
Just do it, come on.

207
00:23:25.976 --> 00:23:27.019
Ok. Two seconds.

208
00:23:35.861 --> 00:23:36.861
Bri.

209
00:23:41.784 --> 00:23:42.910
<i>OK, open.</i>

210
00:23:58.926 --> 00:23:59.926
Do you know what that is?

211
00:24:03.305 --> 00:24:04.305
Uhhh... No.

212
00:24:05.599 --> 00:24:06.599
That's me.

213
00:24:09.687 --> 00:24:10.687
<i>OK.</i>

214
00:24:11.355 --> 00:24:14.274
That's Venus De Milo. She's
the goddess of love...


215
00:24:16.610 --> 00:24:18.153
You know I was named after her.

216
00:24:21.907 --> 00:24:23.617
Thank you. That's nice.

217
00:24:24.868 --> 00:24:25.868
You're welcome.

218
00:24:38.924 --> 00:24:40.342
- Hey, Bri?
- Yeah.


219
00:24:41.385 --> 00:24:45.139
I know you said it's bad luck for people
to look at your photos before your show...


220
00:24:45.889 --> 00:24:47.224
but can I please see them?

221
00:24:48.600 --> 00:24:49.810
I don't have them framed yet.

222
00:24:50.602 --> 00:24:52.187
I don't care about frames, it's ok.

223
00:24:56.191 --> 00:24:57.191
<i>OK.</i>

224
00:24:58.277 --> 00:25:00.195
Qk... Cool.

225
00:25:10.247 --> 00:25:12.166
Jesus, they're amazing.

226
00:25:13.625 --> 00:25:15.044
Why do they all have masks?

227
00:25:15.919 --> 00:25:18.881
I don't know. Mascarade theme I guess.

228
00:25:23.052 --> 00:25:24.970
Hmm... this one is stunning.

229
00:25:25.512 --> 00:25:28.098
Thank you. Very proud of that one.

230
00:25:28.891 --> 00:25:30.267
See how she's turning away?

231
00:25:30.893 --> 00:25:34.813
Sort of sad but... l don't know,
inviting at the same time.


232
00:25:36.023 --> 00:25:37.066
Who is she?

233
00:25:37.191 --> 00:25:40.778
Uhh, an old friend, Christine.
Known her for years.


234
00:25:44.406 --> 00:25:45.406
Hmm.

235
00:25:55.542 --> 00:25:56.627
Hey, Bri?

236
00:25:57.711 --> 00:25:58.711
Yeah.

237
00:26:00.047 --> 00:26:01.340
How do you know Christine?

238
00:26:06.095 --> 00:26:10.933
She was uhh, friends with my wife.
She was her best friend.


239
00:26:18.899 --> 00:26:20.275
What's the matter?

240
00:26:26.448 --> 00:26:29.243
- Does she live around here?
- Yeah.


241
00:26:31.453 --> 00:26:34.498
Ok... What does she do?

242
00:26:35.541 --> 00:26:38.961
She uhh, she owns an antique
store here in town.


243
00:26:40.379 --> 00:26:41.379
Oh.

244
00:26:56.603 --> 00:26:57.938
Did you guys ever hook up?

245
00:27:03.902 --> 00:27:07.573
When Victoria passed away,
we had a short-lived thing.


246
00:27:08.740 --> 00:27:10.284
Ya know, we got close.

247
00:27:11.285 --> 00:27:14.955
Ya know we were both mourning the
same person, it sort of connected us.


248
00:27:16.540 --> 00:27:17.875
But I never loved her.

249
00:27:18.876 --> 00:27:22.421
Ya know, it was just something
that happened a long time ago.


250
00:27:23.797 --> 00:27:27.050
And now we're just friends. I promise.

251
00:28:07.466 --> 00:28:08.466
Hey, Bri?

252
00:28:10.177 --> 00:28:11.177
Yeah.

253
00:28:14.556 --> 00:28:16.016
I want you to photograph me.

254
00:28:18.602 --> 00:28:19.602
<i>OK.</i>

255
00:28:32.532 --> 00:28:36.536
What if I turn a little bit?
And face the window?


256
00:28:36.578 --> 00:28:37.704
That's fine.

257
00:28:43.210 --> 00:28:44.544
Something like this.

258
00:28:46.880 --> 00:28:51.426
Let's lose the mask. I uhh...
I don't think it's working on this one.


259
00:28:52.594 --> 00:28:53.637
<i>OK.</i>

260
00:29:07.234 --> 00:29:08.234
We got it.

261
00:29:10.195 --> 00:29:11.195
Really?

262
00:29:12.364 --> 00:29:13.907
That's it. We got the shot.

263
00:29:14.992 --> 00:29:15.993
We just started though?

264
00:29:16.410 --> 00:29:19.288
We only need that one shot...
We just got it.


265
00:29:21.415 --> 00:29:22.415
<i>OK.</i>

266
00:29:48.859 --> 00:29:50.110
Do you want to get some sushi?

267
00:29:51.320 --> 00:29:53.613
Uhh... Got a really busy day.

268
00:29:56.325 --> 00:29:59.202
Ok, I could umm, come back later,
we could do dinner?


269
00:29:59.369 --> 00:30:02.205
I can make you some pasta and
we can have some red wine?


270
00:30:04.374 --> 00:30:06.960
Umm... Got a lot of meetings
tonight, ya know? Work stuff, so...


271
00:30:08.295 --> 00:30:11.298
That's fine, I should probably work...
anyway.


272
00:30:16.303 --> 00:30:17.554
Qu'est ce tu en pense.

273
00:30:19.973 --> 00:30:20.973
Bravo.

274
00:30:21.099 --> 00:30:23.560
Now if you wanted to say that
you agree you would say,


275
00:30:24.061 --> 00:30:25.061
Je suis d'accord.

276
00:30:27.606 --> 00:30:28.606
ExceHenL

277
00:30:28.982 --> 00:30:31.068
If you did not agree you would say

278
00:37:14.554 --> 00:37:16.806
- Hey, how are you?
- Christine, hey.


279
00:37:17.223 --> 00:37:18.516
- So good to see you.
- So good to see you too.


280
00:37:18.558 --> 00:37:19.851
Oh, thank you.

281
00:37:20.727 --> 00:37:22.520
Let's get your coat off.

282
00:37:22.562 --> 00:37:23.563
Oh, yeah.

283
00:37:23.646 --> 00:37:25.899
You're looking slick and slender there.

284
00:37:28.151 --> 00:37:29.151
Oh yeah, wow.

285
00:37:42.916 --> 00:37:43.875
Get the fuck outta my way.

286
00:37:43.917 --> 00:37:44.917
Jesus!

287
00:37:50.673 --> 00:37:51.673
Watch it, bitch!

288
00:38:00.433 --> 00:38:02.936
Fuck off! Mother fucker!

289
00:38:38.096 --> 00:38:40.765
Shit, look at this... What's baby?
Hey, where you going?


290
00:38:47.105 --> 00:38:48.314
Fucking crazy bitch!

291
00:38:48.982 --> 00:38:49.982
Fuck.

292
00:41:01.990 --> 00:41:02.990
Hello.

293
00:41:03.116 --> 00:41:04.325
Can I come up?

294
00:41:05.368 --> 00:41:06.368
Fine.

295
00:41:48.619 --> 00:41:49.787
Can I come in?

296
00:41:55.835 --> 00:41:56.835
Come in.

297
00:42:05.094 --> 00:42:06.554
You wanna sit down?

298
00:42:49.055 --> 00:42:50.389
So, what's up?

299
00:42:52.683 --> 00:42:53.893
I got your note.

300
00:42:57.271 --> 00:42:58.481
Why did you follow me?

301
00:43:01.234 --> 00:43:02.902
Why did you lie to me?

302
00:43:04.570 --> 00:43:08.116
Because you wouldn't have understood,
and I didn't want to fight.


303
00:43:13.371 --> 00:43:17.416
Look, Christine has a boyfriend, ok?
And we're just friends.


304
00:43:23.172 --> 00:43:24.799
Look, Venus, this is hard, like...

305
00:43:26.092 --> 00:43:27.593
I really care about you.

306
00:43:30.221 --> 00:43:31.889
I just can't see you anymore.

307
00:43:34.851 --> 00:43:39.939
The truth of it is...
I'm just over my wife.


308
00:43:43.734 --> 00:43:48.781
I try to be,
I do... I'm just not.

309
00:43:50.950 --> 00:43:52.827
I fell for you, Venus, 
I really did...

310
00:43:53.953 --> 00:43:56.497
but with the way things are...

311
00:43:58.082 --> 00:44:01.169
I need to be alone... Venus?

312
00:44:14.557 --> 00:44:15.725
I'm gonna go, ok?

313
00:44:27.653 --> 00:44:28.653
Wait!

314
00:44:33.326 --> 00:44:34.327
Wait.

315
00:44:50.009 --> 00:44:51.010
Venus.

316
00:45:00.144 --> 00:45:03.814
Venus, Venus... Venus, Venus...

317
00:45:10.821 --> 00:45:12.240
I can't do this.

318
00:45:14.200 --> 00:45:15.200
<i>OK'?</i>

319
00:45:19.205 --> 00:45:20.414
I'm sorry

320
00:45:23.501 --> 00:45:24.543
I gotta go.

321
00:45:43.896 --> 00:45:46.691
Hey it's Brian here,
uhh, sorry I missed your call.


322
00:45:46.732 --> 00:45:49.068
Leave a message and
I'll get back to you as soon as I can.


323
00:48:48.497 --> 00:48:49.498
Scotch on the rocks.

324
00:49:11.103 --> 00:49:14.315
You're supposed to look at me when you
toast, didn't you ever hear that?


325
00:49:14.356 --> 00:49:15.649
Ahh, sorry, it was burning.

326
00:49:15.691 --> 00:49:18.360
It's bad luck if you don't do that,
so now we're cursed.


327
00:49:19.945 --> 00:49:21.238
I can live with that.

328
00:49:23.908 --> 00:49:26.076
<i>Yeah. OK. Are you sure'?</i>

329
00:49:26.202 --> 00:49:27.202
Urn hm.

330
00:49:28.913 --> 00:49:30.623
So do you think all women are whores?

331
00:49:31.624 --> 00:49:32.875
Only the good ones.

332
00:49:33.292 --> 00:49:34.335
What does that mean?

333
00:49:36.086 --> 00:49:38.672
You gotta kiss an angel good morning

334
00:49:38.714 --> 00:49:41.967
and love her like the devil
when you get back home


335
00:49:44.970 --> 00:49:46.514
The devil... the devil, that's good.

336
00:49:46.972 --> 00:49:48.682
- You like the devil?
- That's really good.


337
00:49:49.016 --> 00:49:50.809
I'll bet you do like the devil.

338
00:49:53.896 --> 00:49:55.814
I gotta go to the little girl's room.

339
00:50:43.654 --> 00:50:44.697
Hey, heyH.

340
00:50:45.823 --> 00:50:46.782
What's the matter, come on.

341
00:50:46.865 --> 00:50:50.703
Stop for a sec, hey, hey,
can you just stop? Hey! Hey!


342
00:50:52.746 --> 00:50:54.540
AHHHH! Fuck!

343
00:50:57.376 --> 00:50:58.376
Stupid cunt!

344
00:51:00.379 --> 00:51:02.923
You'll fucking listen to me now, bitch.

345
00:54:02.060 --> 00:54:04.521
Hi. You must be Venus.

346
00:54:12.070 --> 00:54:15.365
I would have come by earlier but
Brian says you work pretty late,


347
00:54:15.407 --> 00:54:18.118
so I figured I'd give you
some time to sleep in...


348
00:54:22.748 --> 00:54:26.960
Oh... Your stuff... from the house.

349
00:54:28.253 --> 00:54:30.255
Brian's feeling really
weird about everything


350
00:54:30.297 --> 00:54:31.298
as I'm sure you are too,

351
00:54:31.507 --> 00:54:34.760
so I thought I'd make it
easier on both of you.


352
00:54:49.233 --> 00:54:51.026
Look, I know this must be hard.

353
00:54:52.277 --> 00:54:54.238
But honestly it's for the best.

354
00:54:55.697 --> 00:54:59.576
Brian's very... complex,

355
00:55:01.119 --> 00:55:02.955
Sometimes he just needs to be alone.

356
00:55:04.414 --> 00:55:05.707
He's in a lot of pain

357
00:55:07.000 --> 00:55:08.377
since Victoria dies.

358
00:55:09.670 --> 00:55:10.879
Highs and lows,

359
00:55:11.421 --> 00:55:13.507
drinking, depression,

360
00:55:14.132 --> 00:55:16.134
the occasional fling at the strip club...

361
00:55:18.971 --> 00:55:20.222
he's just very...

362
00:55:22.015 --> 00:55:23.015
lost.

363
00:55:23.308 --> 00:55:26.812
And I'm really... the only one...

364
00:55:28.021 --> 00:55:30.190
who... knows how to take care of him.

365
00:55:43.662 --> 00:55:44.662
Fucking bitch.

366
00:56:07.352 --> 00:56:08.395
Fuck.

367
00:56:14.651 --> 00:56:15.652
<i>L</i> 9° YOU go.

368
00:56:15.694 --> 00:56:17.905
He said no fuck you,
you put me in there,

369
00:56:17.988 --> 00:56:19.028
I didn't put you in there!

370
00:56:19.114 --> 00:56:20.954
You put me in there cause
you fucking told me.


371
00:56:22.034 --> 00:56:24.244
And I said shit,
fuck you, who are you?

372
00:56:24.411 --> 00:56:25.411
Who are you?

373
00:56:25.579 --> 00:56:27.497
Get outta my house! 
Get outta my house!

374
00:59:20.962 --> 00:59:22.089
Hi sweetie,

375
00:59:24.508 --> 00:59:27.052
I missed you. You wanna go outside?

376
00:59:57.541 --> 00:59:58.917
Hey, it's me.

377
00:59:59.626 --> 01:00:01.962
I just got back, 
I guess you're busy.

378
01:00:02.921 --> 01:00:05.257
Anyway, I'm just hanging out.

379
01:00:06.216 --> 01:00:08.426
Do some yoga, take a bath...

380
01:00:09.302 --> 01:00:11.680
maybe touch myself a little,

381
01:00:12.389 --> 01:00:13.389
thinking about you...

382
01:00:23.483 --> 01:00:26.528
Anyway uhh, give me call when you can.

383
01:00:27.070 --> 01:00:28.070
(Bye 89X)'-

384
01:01:15.869 --> 01:01:17.871
Love, Venus.

385
01:02:03.166 --> 01:02:04.417
I'll call you back.

386
01:02:24.229 --> 01:02:27.565
Oh! Oh... Oh... Oh,

Alright, yeah,

I am looking at you.

393
01:03:00.140 --> 01:03:04.102
Uh uh, mister, look at me.

394
01:03:05.645 --> 01:03:10.442
Here. Yeah. Yeah that's good.

395
01:03:17.115 --> 01:03:18.283
You wanna touch me?

396
01:03:22.162 --> 01:03:23.496
Yeah, yeah.

397
01:03:25.123 --> 01:03:26.124
Do it.

398
01:03:27.125 --> 01:03:28.335
You sure? I can touch you?

399
01:03:28.501 --> 01:03:30.420
- Do it.
- I can touch you right?


400
01:03:30.462 --> 01:03:31.462
Touch me.

401
01:03:34.466 --> 01:03:35.508
Not there.

402

<i>OK...</i>

What did I fucking tell you?!

410

You piece of shit! 
Fucking look at me!

You think's she's 0k?

412
01:04:03.828 --> 01:04:04.913
Rough night.

413
01:04:04.996 --> 01:04:06.164
Holy shit.

414
01:04:06.623 --> 01:04:08.208
She's really messed up.

415
01:04:09.834 --> 01:04:11.294
Venus, are you ok? Honey?

416
01:04:31.439 --> 01:04:32.607
Girl, what's wrong with you?

417
01:04:33.441 --> 01:04:35.693
Are you ok? Venus?

418
01:04:38.738 --> 01:04:40.365
Venus, look at me.

Hey... Hey! Hey,

421
01:04:55.255 --> 01:04:56.047
Are you high?

422
01:04:56.089 --> 01:04:59.509
Venus! I told you to get the

01:04:59.551 --> 01:05:01.678
Alright, I'm get her outta here,

What are you doing?

437
01:06:44.572 --> 01:06:45.615

441
01:07:00.338 --> 01:07:03.383
I just... l just can't hold on
to anything that's good.


442
01:07:04.008 --> 01:07:05.593
You're not a piece of shit, Brian,

443
01:07:05.677 --> 01:07:08.596
you're just... you're just really hurting.

444
01:07:09.847 --> 01:07:11.516
You've been through so much, you know?

445
01:07:15.311 --> 01:07:17.897
She uhh... she didn't even
leave a goddamn note.


446
01:07:20.942 --> 01:07:21.942
I know..

447
01:07:23.861 --> 01:07:25.621
I don't think you should

I know...

452
01:07:36.791 --> 01:07:38.918
Nobody's ever loved me
the way that you have...


453
01:07:42.171 --> 01:07:44.007
I'm gonna come by and uhh,

I'm gonna see you, on the
moon, and I don't care!


465

Light in your face... and I don't

466

Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck...

Pull over! Get out of the fucking car!

Get out you little bitch!

470
01:10:09.777 --> 01:10:10.777
What are you doing?

471
01:10:36.220 --> 01:10:39.432
Gaahhhh, fucking bitch! 
Fucking bitch!

472

Fuck. You wanna do this?

01:10:44.395 --> 01:10:45.563
You wanna fucking do this?

474
01:10:45.646 --> 01:10:46.939
We're gonna do this.

475
01:10:57.116 --> 01:10:58.493
That's a good girl.

476
01:11:21.057 --> 01:11:22.517
Get out of the fucking car!

477
01:11:23.434 --> 01:11:26.062
I said get out of the fucking car
you piece of shit!

01:11:27.396 --> 01:11:28.981
What the fuck is wrong with

479
01:11:55.258 --> 01:11:56.258
Fuck.

480
01:12:43.347 --> 01:12:44.265
Hi, I'm leaving in five

481
01:12:44.307 --> 01:12:46.392
Venus, look I've been
trying to call you, ok?


482
01:12:47.184 --> 01:12:49.624
I shouldn't have agreed to you
coming over in the first place.


483
01:12:50.938 --> 01:12:53.024
It's just... it just wasn't a good idea.

484
01:12:55.359 --> 01:12:56.944
Venus look, I just can't do this, ok?

485
01:12:57.236 --> 01:12:57.862
Brian

486
01:12:57.945 --> 01:13:00.448
No, Venus listen to me.
I know you're hurting.


487
01:13:01.574 --> 01:13:03.159
You're fucking being selfish, 0k?

488
01:13:03.200 --> 01:13:04.911
This isn't about your feelings.

489
01:13:05.536 --> 01:13:07.413
You wish things were different, fucking...

490
01:13:07.830 --> 01:13:09.206
I wish things were different.

491
01:13:09.248 --> 01:13:10.041
Brian please.

492
01:13:10.207 --> 01:13:12.668
I wish Victoria didn't fucking kill herself
but she did.


493
01:13:13.169 --> 01:13:17.673
My wife killed herself
and I miss her every single fucking day!


494
01:13:18.049 --> 01:13:20.051
I just... l just
need you to go away.

495
01:13:20.176 --> 01:13:21.302
I just need to be alone.

496
01:13:21.552 --> 01:13:23.638
Please Venus, just leave me alone.

497
01:14:46.762 --> 01:14:49.056
- Hey.
- Hey, I need a favor.


498
01:15:01.152 --> 01:15:02.152
Hey it's Cha...

499
01:15:15.166 --> 01:15:16.166
Hey.

500
01:15:21.130 --> 01:15:22.130
I'm here.

501
01:15:23.466 --> 01:15:25.760
Venus? Venus?

502
01:15:27.344 --> 01:15:28.344
Earth to Venus.

503
01:15:29.638 --> 01:15:31.038
You performing live tonight, bitch?

504
01:15:31.557 --> 01:15:32.837
The fuck you gonna do with this?

505
01:15:36.062 --> 01:15:37.342
You thinking about going blonde?

506
01:15:39.190 --> 01:15:40.191
I see that for you.

507
01:15:41.525 --> 01:15:43.736
Hey? Venus?

508
01:15:45.446 --> 01:15:47.865
Girl, what's wrong with you?
Did you take something?


509
01:15:48.741 --> 01:15:50.284
Venus, talk to me girl, what's wrong?

510
01:15:52.244 --> 01:15:54.955
Alright, come on, we'll sit down,
smoke a fag and calm down,


511
01:15:55.039 --> 01:15:56.165
wait, where you going?

512
01:15:56.373 --> 01:15:57.373
To see Brian.

513
01:15:57.708 --> 01:15:58.708
Dressed like that?

514
01:15:58.793 --> 01:16:01.921
Girl seriously, this guy got you upset
and you're acting stupid.


515
01:16:02.129 --> 01:16:04.289
No man should have you're head
all messed up like that.


516
01:16:04.882 --> 01:16:06.602
Come on Venus you
remember what I told you?

517
01:16:06.884 --> 01:16:08.552
Venus? Venus?

518
01:16:09.720 --> 01:16:12.848
Never date a man you meet at the fucking
club, got your head all fucked up.


519
01:16:12.973 --> 01:16:15.226
He dated your ass for months,
he made you fall in love with him,


520
01:16:15.392 --> 01:16:16.435
and then he dropped your ass.

521
01:16:16.477 --> 01:16:19.477
That doesn't sound like a man, Venus,
that sound like a fucking pussy to me!


522
01:17:02.731 --> 01:17:04.942
Shit! Fuck!

523
01:17:15.369 --> 01:17:16.620
911, where is your emergency?

524
01:17:16.662 --> 01:17:19.262
Yeah, I'm in an apartment and there,
and there's a dead body here.


525
01:17:19.748 --> 01:17:21.709
Ok mam, I need you to slow down
and I need you to tell me exactly...


526
01:17:21.750 --> 01:17:23.627
I know who did
it, her name is Venus.

527
01:17:23.669 --> 01:17:25.796
She just left and
I know where she's going.

528
01:19:32.381 --> 01:19:33.381
Don't move!

529
01:19:35.301 --> 01:19:36.427
You're under arrest! Freeze!

530
01:19:37.511 --> 01:19:40.597
Brian! Brian! No! Brian!

531
01:20:09.793 --> 01:20:11.045
What happened in Paris?

532
01:20:16.425 --> 01:20:17.425
What do you mean?

533
01:20:17.968 --> 01:20:20.220
Well you were dancing
at the Paris ballet studio...


534
01:20:22.306 --> 01:20:23.746
Can you tell me what happened there?

535
01:20:26.310 --> 01:20:27.644
I was dancing in a show.

536
01:20:30.314 --> 01:20:33.984
But you were removed from the company.
Do you remember why?


537
01:20:42.368 --> 01:20:44.078
I'm looking at an article here,

538
01:20:45.079 --> 01:20:46.080
and it says,

539
01:20:46.705 --> 01:20:50.209
a Sterling ballet school
alum, Venus Noella,


540
01:20:50.542 --> 01:20:54.922
has allegedly pushed fellow ballet dancer
Thomas Pagan down a flight of stairs


541
01:20:54.963 --> 01:20:58.467
at the Paris ballet studio
following the evening's performance.


542
01:20:58.842 --> 01:21:00.969
Thomas is currently in intensive care

543
01:21:02.137 --> 01:21:05.891
and is speculated to be paralyzed
from the wasit down.


544
01:21:06.350 --> 01:21:14.350
Now, I uhh, I understand no charges
were filed due to lack of evidence.


545
01:21:15.234 --> 01:21:17.528
When did you last speak to Doctor Kardash?

546
01:21:21.865 --> 01:21:24.284
I just want to talk to Brian.

547
01:21:29.540 --> 01:21:31.375
I have someone waiting outside.

548
01:21:33.043 --> 01:21:34.503
I'd like to bring them in now.

549
01:21:44.596 --> 01:21:45.596
Please come in.

550
01:22:20.757 --> 01:22:24.553
Venus? Have you ever met this woman?

551
01:22:27.973 --> 01:22:28.973
Yes.

552
01:22:31.977 --> 01:22:34.938
No... Venus, we've never met.

553
01:22:41.737 --> 01:22:44.615
You followed me, to the desert.

554
01:22:47.451 --> 01:22:49.620
I was never in the desert with you.

555
01:23:04.593 --> 01:23:07.387
You're still fucking Brian, aren't you?

556
01:23:10.474 --> 01:23:11.474
No.

557
01:23:13.310 --> 01:23:14.520
I saw you...

558
01:23:15.687 --> 01:23:18.357
fucking him, in his house.

559
01:23:22.778 --> 01:23:27.574
I have a boyfriend... l
would never cheat on him.


560
01:23:30.494 --> 01:23:31.954
I don't know what you saw.

561
01:23:39.503 --> 01:23:43.173
The last time I saw Brian,
we were having dinner.


562
01:23:44.800 --> 01:23:50.013
He told me he was seeing someone,
but he wanted to end it.


563
01:23:52.849 --> 01:24:00.524
And then l... got home from work the
next night. The doorbell rings.


564
01:24:03.360 --> 01:24:04.945
That's when I found my cat.

565
01:24:07.531 --> 01:24:11.368
And then shortly after,
a detective shows up at my door


566
01:24:11.451 --> 01:24:15.247
saying a woman named Venus was arrested,

567
01:24:16.665 --> 01:24:17.958
claiming that she killed me.

568
01:24:22.546 --> 01:24:24.298
That's when I found out what happened.

569
01:24:27.801 --> 01:24:29.177
And that's why I'm here.

570
01:24:36.059 --> 01:24:41.106
Because I want you
to know what you did.

571
01:24:44.526 --> 01:24:45.526
Venus?

572
01:24:47.571 --> 01:24:48.571
Venus?

573
01:24:49.197 --> 01:24:50.240
When you were arrested,

574
01:24:52.326 --> 01:24:53.994
you were found inside Brian's house,

575
01:24:54.036 --> 01:24:55.076
what were you doing there?

576
01:24:58.498 --> 01:24:59.875
I was with Brian.

577
01:25:01.918 --> 01:25:03.962
We were... we were making love.

578
01:25:05.922 --> 01:25:09.384
No. You were alone.

579
01:25:24.441 --> 01:25:27.069
I need you to
look at this photograph now.

580
01:25:33.200 --> 01:25:34.200
Venus?

581
01:26:04.398 --> 01:26:05.857
Venus, Venus!

582
01:26:06.733 --> 01:26:08.151
Venus... Venus!

583
01:26:15.075 --> 01:26:16.075
I can't do this.

584
01:26:18.495 --> 01:26:19.495
<i>OK'?</i>

585
01:26:23.417 --> 01:26:24.417
I'm sorry...

586
01:26:26.878 --> 01:26:28.255
I gotta go.

587
01:26:29.335 --> 01:26:35.206
