What do we do now?

Hot chocolate?

12
00:00:51.496 --> 00:00:53.540
[sighs] I mean, where do we live?

13
00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:56.501
[panting] Well,

14
00:00:57.711 --> 00:00:58.962
we could go back to England.

15
00:01:00.255 --> 00:01:02.883
We could stay here in Sweden.

16
00:01:05.052 --> 00:01:06.511
We could go anywhere, really.

17
00:01:07.804 --> 00:01:10.098

That was the last summer with Mamma.

I'm nervous. [breathes shakily]

23
00:01:46.677 --> 00:01:48.595
Well, she's not gonna be here.

24

- You know that, right?
- [breathes heavily]


25

[Magnus] That's pretty good. Oh.

[Alice] What?

37
00:03:03.879 --> 00:03:05.547
- That was crap.
- [Magnus laughs]


38
00:03:05.547 --> 00:03:08.258
You know, they're supposed to be crap.
That's the point.

00:03:08.258 --> 00:03:09.426
You say one.

Oh, no.

- Yeah.
- Yeah. You do one.

00:03:19.061 --> 00:03:20.812
Okay, I got one. Um...

00:03:20.812 --> 00:03:23.607
[smacks lips]
It's sort of similar to that one.

- I'm married to a Swede. Go ahead.

Okay, so, Nelson Mandela
has a Swedish half-brother.

Who's Nelson Mandela?

Mmm, it's not gonna work
if you don't know who Nelson Mandela is.


50
00:03:34.284 --> 00:03:35.535
I know who he was.

It's really funny in Swedish.

00:04:01.937 --> 00:04:03.897
[Jo] You changed around the cupboards.

56
00:04:03.897 --> 00:04:07.317
Uh, no, I'm not really
a move-the-cupboards-around kind of guy.


57
00:04:11.613 --> 00:04:12.739
Jo, can we have a talk?

58
00:04:14.283 --> 00:04:15.450
Of course.

59
00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:21.582
It's just... We didn't really leave things
in a very satisfactory way when you went.


60
00:04:23.166 --> 00:04:25.586
[stammers] How did we leave things?

61
00:04:28.005 --> 00:04:33.135
Well, you... [sighs] ...didn't look at me...
[chuckles] ...when we said goodbye.


62
00:04:33.135 --> 00:04:35.387
[stammers] Of course I did.

63
00:04:36.096 --> 00:04:38.265
No. You didn't.

64
00:04:40.225 --> 00:04:42.436
I've thought about it
a lot the last year.

65
00:04:43.312 --> 00:04:46.773
I don't know if you noticed,
but it was a really appalling few months.


66
00:04:48.442 --> 00:04:51.278
For me, at least. 
Before you went away.

67
00:04:52.779 --> 00:04:54.281
Uh, I'm sorry.

68
00:04:54.907 --> 00:04:56.867
That's not... That's not how I remember it.

69
00:04:57.367 --> 00:04:59.411
I'm back and I'm... 
I'm not going anywhere.

70
00:05:02.706 --> 00:05:03.749
Do you love me?

71
00:05:06.418 --> 00:05:07.669
But of course I do.

72
00:05:07.669 --> 00:05:10.881
I'm not being needy.
It's a genuine question.


73
00:05:21.433 --> 00:05:25.312
Of course I love you, you big idiot.

00:08:00.092 --> 00:08:02.928
[in English] I was just asking
if you wanted to keep it or toss it.

Toss it.

Yeah.

Was there anything specific
that upset you before I left?

So, there wasn't, like,
one specific thing?

I hope you know that.

about you and Frederic.

[Magnus sighs]

119
00:09:49.326 --> 00:09:51.286
I would never do something like that.

- Right.
- Magnus, please.


121
00:09:55.749 --> 00:09:57.417
I just want us to be honest
with each other.

I mean, nothing happened really.

...we went for a drink.

I thought you were leaving me, Jo.

131
00:10:25.862 --> 00:10:30.367
You know, there was a lot... [stammers]
...a lot of gossip about you and Frederic.


132
00:10:31.118 --> 00:10:33.036
I assumed you'd come back,
and we'd be done.

But why?

- Like... [stammers]
- Just trying to level with you.


135
00:10:37.624 --> 00:10:41.003
Yeah. [stammers, scoffs]
I want you to be my husband, okay?


136
00:10:41.712 --> 00:10:43.547
I want Alice to be my daughter.

137
00:10:44.548 --> 00:10:48.343
When I was up there, the only thing
I could focus on was getting home

to the main hall. Emergency briefing.


163
00:13:10.694 --> 00:13:12.654
Yeah, I just wanted to say...

164
00:13:16.241 --> 00:13:17.743
[captain] <i>Attention, please.</i>

165
00:13:17.743 --> 00:13:21.038
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
this is the captain speaking.</i>


166
00:13:21.747 --> 00:13:24.708
<i>We are turning
and making a call in Santa Barbara.</i>


167
00:13:25.334 --> 00:13:30.130
<i>It looks like there was an incident
with one of our guests overnight.</i>


168
00:13:31.423 --> 00:13:35.677
<i>We have to complete a few necessary
safeguards and procedures.</i>


169
00:13:36.303 --> 00:13:38.639
<i>We will be asking
you to stay on board,</i>

170
00:13:38.639 --> 00:13:41.850
<i>and we hope this won't
inconvenience you too badly.</i>


171
00:13:48.273 --> 00:13:51.234
[Michaela] <i>Henry, you are funded by NASA,
and you are a NASA employee.</i>


172
00:13:51.234 --> 00:13:54.238
And have been since long before
you were born, Michaela.


173
00:13:54.238 --> 00:13:57.115
<i>We need to talk about the fact
that no permission is granted to you</i>


174
00:13:57.115 --> 00:13:59.618
<i>to go to another space agency
with RPL equipment.</i>


175
00:13:59.618 --> 00:14:01.703
The CAL is mine.

176
00:14:02.454 --> 00:14:04.081
<i>It didn't work, Henry.</i>

177
00:14:04.081 --> 00:14:05.624
No, please don't say that.

178
00:14:05.624 --> 00:14:08.210
<i>I know. It's very tough to let go.</i>

179
00:14:08.210 --> 00:14:10.379
Yeah, well, this is not
what failure looks like.


180
00:14:10.379 --> 00:14:12.172
I just need to think it through.

181
00:14:12.172 --> 00:14:13.799
It's having an effect.

182
00:14:13.799 --> 00:14:16.260
<i>You need to come home, okay?</i>

183
00:14:16.260 --> 00:14:18.512
<i>You've had ten days
with a lot of assistance</i>


184
00:14:18.512 --> 00:14:22.057
<i>and there's no evidence the CAL worked.
We're shutting it down.</i>


185
00:14:22.766 --> 00:14:24.309
<i>This is the end of the project.</i>

186
00:14:25.018 --> 00:14:27.646
- [groaning]
- <i>Henry...</i>


187
00:14:38.073 --> 00:14:39.658
[Jo] <i>I misremember things.</i>

188
00:14:39.658 --> 00:14:40.867
Such as?

189
00:14:42.828 --> 00:14:46.290
Where things are. My car.

190
00:14:46.957 --> 00:14:48.292
Okay.

191
00:14:48.292 --> 00:14:52.296
I remember it as red, but it's blue.

192
00:14:53.380 --> 00:14:55.424
Uh, it's a small thing, but, um...

193
00:14:55.424 --> 00:14:57.342
Actually, it's quite a big thing.

194
00:15:01.430 --> 00:15:03.557
I think, um... 
[stammers] I think I...

195
00:15:10.397 --> 00:15:14.484
I have a piano in my house,
and I don't play the piano.


196
00:15:16.904 --> 00:15:18.530
Do you have hallucinations?

197
00:15:20.824 --> 00:15:21.825
Yeah.

198
00:15:23.201 --> 00:15:24.202
What kind?

199
00:15:26.830 --> 00:15:29.917
I see Paul Lancaster.

200
00:15:31.376 --> 00:15:32.628
I mean, I...

201
00:15:34.046 --> 00:15:35.672
His ghost, I suppose.

202
00:15:35.672 --> 00:15:40.677
Sometimes it feels like
I'm still up there on the ISS.


203
00:15:41.929 --> 00:15:45.641
What you are telling me
seems highly symptomatic of PTSD,


204
00:15:45.641 --> 00:15:51.063
where you would expect replays
of stressful events, memory lapses, anger.


205
00:15:51.063 --> 00:15:53.357
It's not surprising
you would have this condition.


206
00:15:53.357 --> 00:15:55.108
You were in fear of your life,

207
00:15:55.108 --> 00:15:57.069
very concerned about your crew,
your family.


208
00:15:57.694 --> 00:16:00.864
Dealing with the death of a friend,
you've been through huge trauma.


209
00:16:01.365 --> 00:16:04.868
Now you're back to Earth,
and this can be where it hits you.


210
00:16:07.746 --> 00:16:10.540
Listen, we'll try you with
a dexamethasone-suppression test


211
00:16:10.540 --> 00:16:12.626
and see what your cortisol levels are.

212
00:16:13.418 --> 00:16:15.671
And in the meantime,
I can give you something.


213
00:16:15.671 --> 00:16:16.880
Such as?

214
00:16:17.464 --> 00:16:18.674
Lithium.

215
00:16:18.674 --> 00:16:22.177
[chuckles] Jenny, 
I'm not psychotic.

216
00:16:23.262 --> 00:16:24.596
I'm not depressed.

217
00:16:24.596 --> 00:16:27.182
No, but it'll calm you.

218
00:16:28.183 --> 00:16:29.601
It calms these things.

219
00:16:36.775 --> 00:16:38.819
[printer whirring]

220
00:16:42.573 --> 00:16:43.574
[whirring stops]

221
00:16:45.701 --> 00:16:48.036
I don't want this. I don't...

222
00:16:51.832 --> 00:16:53.834
This kind of stuff is career-ending.

223
00:17:07.889 --> 00:17:10.141
[Henry] I'm interested
in the research you're doing.


224
00:17:10.641 --> 00:17:12.769
What's it called, "salutogenesis"?

225
00:17:13.854 --> 00:17:15.731
- I, uh...
- How do you define it?


226
00:17:17.774 --> 00:17:19.275
I
-I didn't know you were here.

227
00:17:19.275 --> 00:17:20.944
Oh, I'm here.

228
00:17:22.029 --> 00:17:25.365
Think it's a better place for me to be.
I think I can help.


229
00:17:25.365 --> 00:17:27.367
So how is it going f... for you?

230
00:17:28.118 --> 00:17:29.411
With the CAL, you mean?

231
00:17:29.411 --> 00:17:31.371
Well, I keep running it and running it.

232
00:17:31.371 --> 00:17:33.790
I think I may be
on the edge of something.

233
00:17:33.790 --> 00:17:34.750
Uh-huh.

234
00:17:34.750 --> 00:17:38.295
I don't remember much about
the CAL before the accident, I, uh...


235
00:17:39.421 --> 00:17:40.797
- I...
- Would you like to see it?


236
00:17:43.467 --> 00:17:46.261
I'm not getting a hell of a lot of stuff
I understand.


237
00:17:48.972 --> 00:17:52.142
Have you heard much anecdotal evidence
from astronauts?


238
00:17:52.643 --> 00:17:55.020
How it affects them? 
It's not all good.

239
00:17:56.647 --> 00:17:58.815
I know some felt burned out.

240
00:17:58.815 --> 00:18:00.150
Oh, yeah.

241
00:18:00.150 --> 00:18:02.527
Um... People find it tough.

242
00:18:02.527 --> 00:18:04.529
Go through things they don't understand.

243
00:18:05.030 --> 00:18:06.365
Yeah.

244
00:18:06.365 --> 00:18:09.243
I have a couple of friends...
<i>Gemini IV</i> crew...


245
00:18:09.243 --> 00:18:10.994
Chuck Parks, John Cooper...

246
00:18:12.287 --> 00:18:15.374
They smelled burning toast up there.
Both of them.


247
00:18:16.583 --> 00:18:18.627
John heard a dog barking. [chuckles]

248
00:18:19.211 --> 00:18:20.712
Always said it was Laika.

249
00:18:21.463 --> 00:18:24.049
You know, I wonder how Laika felt.

250
00:18:25.509 --> 00:18:26.718
You a dog person?

251
00:18:30.180 --> 00:18:31.765
Uh... [chuckles] ...ish.

252
00:18:31.765 --> 00:18:36.061
Hmm. It's always been the case
since we started flying high altitude.


253
00:18:37.062 --> 00:18:39.523
I was a test pilot, pre
-Apollo.

254
00:18:40.023 --> 00:18:44.194
Flying the highest altitudes you can,
right up to the edge of space.


255
00:18:44.778 --> 00:18:48.323
It was pretty common back then
for colleagues to report a powerful force


256
00:18:48.323 --> 00:18:52.744
pressing down on one of the wings
of the aircraft above 90,000 feet.


257
00:18:53.620 --> 00:18:55.664
They called it "the left hand of God."

258
00:18:56.540 --> 00:18:57.666
I knew this guy.

259
00:18:58.333 --> 00:18:59.585
Lost his son.

260
00:19:00.502 --> 00:19:03.005
Little boy, six years old,

261
00:19:04.381 --> 00:19:07.134
drowned in a lake
on his baby sister's birthday.


262
00:19:07.801 --> 00:19:12.222
This guy, a couple years later,
flying <i>DC-10s</i> over Nevada,


263
00:19:14.057 --> 00:19:15.309
heard a voice.

264
00:19:16.310 --> 00:19:17.477
A child's voice.

265
00:19:18.061 --> 00:19:19.438
His son's voice.

266
00:19:20.063 --> 00:19:22.274
"Daddy, watch out."

267
00:19:23.400 --> 00:19:26.820
Noticed that he'd plunged into a dive,
managed to pull out.


268
00:19:28.155 --> 00:19:30.949
Till the end of his life,
he swore his son saved him.


269
00:19:33.994 --> 00:19:35.120
They don't say it,

270
00:19:36.330 --> 00:19:39.291
but that's the kind of thing
that followed us into space.


271
00:19:44.296 --> 00:19:46.089
You ever seen anything that wasn't there?

272
00:19:48.300 --> 00:19:50.552
Like climbing Everest, going into space.

273
00:19:51.178 --> 00:19:54.097
Your whole focus is on the summit.
And if you're not very careful,


274
00:19:54.097 --> 00:19:57.601
you can forget that once you've summited,
you have to get back down.


275
00:19:59.353 --> 00:20:01.480
That's when people come unstuck.

276
00:20:01.480 --> 00:20:03.231
[beeping]

277
00:20:03.231 --> 00:20:05.817
I have to check this. 
It's running again.

[ringing continues, stops]

288
00:21:06.795 --> 00:21:07.963
- [person] <i>Hi.</i>
- It's Papa.


289
00:21:07.963 --> 00:21:09.464
<i>I can't talk.</i>

290
00:21:09.464 --> 00:21:10.841
It's not working.

291
00:21:11.508 --> 00:21:12.759
<i>Oh, God.</i>

292
00:21:12.759 --> 00:21:14.845
[Bud] There were a few good years but...

293
00:21:14.845 --> 00:21:17.431
Christ, I need to
find a way around it.

294
00:21:17.431 --> 00:21:19.933
I gotta find a way to get
to that motherfucker.


295
00:21:20.934 --> 00:21:23.770
<i>Papa, you gotta stop thinking
like all this stuff is outside of you.</i>


296
00:21:23.770 --> 00:21:25.230
Connie, it's not an illness.

297
00:21:25.230 --> 00:21:28.358
<i>It is an illness.
No one fucked with your brain.</i>


298
00:21:28.358 --> 00:21:31.069
<i>It's you. It's something you can control.</i>

299
00:21:31.069 --> 00:21:34.281
<i>Look, if you're having an episode,
please just take your pills.</i>


300
00:21:34.781 --> 00:21:36.992
- [scoffs] <i>Like I said, I can't talk.</i>
- [line clicks]


301
00:22:01.224 --> 00:22:02.643
[sighs]

302
00:22:03.268 --> 00:22:06.521
[Alice humming]

303
00:22:13.820 --> 00:22:16.949
[teacher]
She speaks about death and accidents.


304
00:22:16.949 --> 00:22:20.744
- And there's this cupboards issue.
- [Jo] What do you mean?


305
00:22:20.744 --> 00:22:23.830
- She hides in cupboards. Yeah. [chuckles]
- She hides in cupboards.


306
00:22:25.457 --> 00:22:28.126
[inhales sharply]
It strikes me that... [sighs]


307
00:22:28.126 --> 00:22:30.587
...maybe you're a system
that has lost each other a bit.


308
00:22:31.088 --> 00:22:33.882
She's ten. She was nine when you left.

309
00:22:33.882 --> 00:22:37.552
That's a long year.
It's a very liminal age.


310
00:22:37.552 --> 00:22:39.263
What do you mean with "liminal"?

311
00:22:40.472 --> 00:22:42.057
Between one thing and another.

312
00:22:42.057 --> 00:22:43.433
Yes. Exactly.

313
00:22:47.145 --> 00:22:49.398
She wants to change things, like her room.

314
00:22:49.398 --> 00:22:53.735
And for a year, you've had the father
and the daughter, and so Mom is...


315
00:22:53.735 --> 00:22:55.988
[sighs] Mom's been too far apart.

316

At the center of the CAL is a chamber
containing a gas of rubidium atoms.


364
00:25:52.122 --> 00:25:55.459
Around it is an arrangement of lasers, electromagnets.

366
00:25:57.711 --> 00:26:02.299
To achieve the condensate,
the laser is turned to resonate the atoms.


367
00:26:02.299 --> 00:26:07.554
Then, when the laser is turned off,
that's when the superposition is formed.

No. The CAL experiment
was meant to capture a state

in which one particle is in
two different states at the same time.

In the mind of an observer.

00:27:41.273 --> 00:27:43.066
Of what you see

00:37:20.602 --> 00:37:25.232

a matter only for me.

[knocking]

477
00:37:26.316 --> 00:37:27.734
Excuse me, Henry.

478
00:37:31.196 --> 00:37:35.993
If you hadn't been so fucking curious,
none of this would have been an issue.


479
00:37:42.207 --> 00:37:43.750
[stutters] Are you okay, Henry?

480
00:37:45.586 --> 00:37:46.878
Commander Caldera?

481
00:37:52.342 --> 00:37:54.428
Curiosity killed the cat.

482
00:38:04.521 --> 00:38:06.523
[footsteps approaching]

483
00:38:10.861 --> 00:38:13.405
[Jo breathing heavily]

484
00:38:17.409 --> 00:38:19.411
[wind chime tinkling]

485
00:38:39.097 --> 00:38:40.724
- Jo?
- Yeah.


486
00:38:44.603 --> 00:38:46.939
We both had a lot of time
to think about things...


487
00:38:49.274 --> 00:38:51.360
and, um, no time to talk.

488
00:38:52.986 --> 00:38:53.987
About what?

489
00:38:54.571 --> 00:38:56.114
Obviously something's changed,

490
00:38:56.114 --> 00:38:59.576
and I-I'm sorry if I said things
that were inappropriate.


491
00:39:01.245 --> 00:39:04.498
But I want you, Jo,
just as much as before.


492
00:39:05.332 --> 00:39:08.961
I want us to serve out the contracts here
and go private, like we said.


493
00:39:09.711 --> 00:39:13.048
I've been talking to them.
StarCosm, Alyanna.


494
00:39:13.632 --> 00:39:14.633
They like it.

495
00:39:15.133 --> 00:39:17.052
Especially if it's the two of us
as a package.


496
00:39:18.303 --> 00:39:19.513
California.

497
00:39:19.513 --> 00:39:23.141
[stammers] I don't know
what you are talking about.


498
00:39:23.141 --> 00:39:24.268
Jo, look.

499
00:39:27.187 --> 00:39:29.856
I think you owe it to me
to tell me if you've changed your mind.


500
00:39:33.026 --> 00:39:34.236
Have you changed your mind?

501
00:39:38.657 --> 00:39:43.161
[Jo] There's a lot of weird differences
between Earth and space,


502
00:39:43.161 --> 00:39:45.122
and it's not just the gravity.

503
00:39:45.122 --> 00:39:46.707
[whispering]

504
00:39:47.291 --> 00:39:51.295
Um, time passes at a different speed
on Earth and in space.


505
00:39:52.212 --> 00:39:53.839
So after six months in space,

506
00:39:53.839 --> 00:40:00.679
an astronaut have aged 0.007 seconds less
than a person who remains on Earth.


507
00:40:00.679 --> 00:40:02.639
- [teacher whispering]
- What happens to it?


508
00:40:03.390 --> 00:40:05.517
- Do you, like, understand anything?
- [Jo] Um, to what?


509
00:40:05.517 --> 00:40:07.227
Where do the 0.7 seconds go?

510
00:40:07.227 --> 00:40:09.021
- [teacher whispers]
- Is it you?


511
00:40:11.064 --> 00:40:13.317
- Huh?
- [Jo] Yeah, I'm talking to you.


512
00:40:14.735 --> 00:40:16.111
Is it her, Magnus?

513
00:40:18.113 --> 00:40:19.114
What's happening?

514
00:40:20.240 --> 00:40:21.575
Is it her?

515
00:40:23.452 --> 00:40:24.536
Come on, Jo.

516
00:40:25.412 --> 00:40:27.748
- I'm sorry, Sara.
-"Oh, I'm sorry, Sara."


517
00:40:27.748 --> 00:40:30.167
[laughing]

518
00:40:30.751 --> 00:40:33.337
- Jo.
- Leave my husband alone, okay?


519
00:40:38.091 --> 00:40:39.176
[door opens]

520
00:40:40.260 --> 00:40:41.887
- [door closes]
- [laughing, chattering]


521
00:40:47.643 --> 00:40:48.936
[Magnus] What the hell was that?

522
00:40:50.646 --> 00:40:51.813
Give me the keys.

523
00:40:57.402 --> 00:40:58.695
This is ridiculous.

524
00:41:00.864 --> 00:41:03.033
You're not supposed to drive
for a couple of weeks.


525
00:41:04.159 --> 00:41:05.827
I know how to drive a fucking car.

526
00:41:05.827 --> 00:41:08.497
Don't swear in front of our daughter.
You're acting like the town drunk.


527
00:41:18.924 --> 00:41:20.050
Can we put on a song?

528
00:41:20.634 --> 00:41:22.678
[in Swedish] I have to concentrate a bit.

529
00:41:26.139 --> 00:41:27.391
[pop music playing]

530
00:41:28.308 --> 00:41:30.852
Alice, I need to concentrate, okay?

531
00:41:35.482 --> 00:41:38.402
[Magnus, in English]
Alice, turn it off. Turn it off, Alice!


532
00:41:38.402 --> 00:41:40.779
- [in Swedish] Alice, for Christ's sake!
- [in English] Mom!

[grunts, breathes heavily]

537
00:41:55.419 --> 00:41:59.590
The various space agencies have
rehab clinics for astronauts who, um, uh...


538
00:41:59.590 --> 00:42:03.552
[sighs] There's a condition
called astronaut burnout.


539
00:42:03.552 --> 00:42:05.095
For God's sake, she's just come back.

540
00:42:05.095 --> 00:42:07.556
- I can't have her going away again.
- She's got a problem.


541
00:42:07.556 --> 00:42:10.976
It's obviously a reaction
to the stress of what went on in space.


542
00:42:10.976 --> 00:42:15.314
And, um, without an intervention,
she'll get worse.


543
00:42:18.567 --> 00:42:20.027
And are you going with her?

544
00:42:22.404 --> 00:42:23.488
Don't know.

545
00:42:24.197 --> 00:42:26.700
- Yeah, maybe. To begin with.
- Hmm.


546
00:42:28.410 --> 00:42:29.912
Did you have an affair with her?

547
00:42:35.709 --> 00:42:37.794
- What did she say?
- Never mind what she said.


548
00:42:38.295 --> 00:42:39.296
Did you?

549
00:42:40.589 --> 00:42:41.632
[sighs]

550
00:42:42.132 --> 00:42:44.676
- Yes.
- [footsteps approaching]


551
00:42:51.934 --> 00:42:53.769
- [Jo] What's this?
- Magnus asked me here


552
00:42:54.436 --> 00:42:56.063
because he's concerned about you.

553
00:42:56.939 --> 00:42:58.440
You lied to me.

554
00:42:58.440 --> 00:42:59.691
What?

555
00:42:59.691 --> 00:43:03.320
He's concerned because you're behaving
in quite a... dissociated way.


556
00:43:03.320 --> 00:43:06.698
I can speak for
myself, you piece of shit.

557
00:43:06.698 --> 00:43:08.367
What have you said to him?

558
00:43:08.367 --> 00:43:09.701
I told him the truth.

559
00:43:14.414 --> 00:43:20.629
Um, I hon... [stammers] Honestly,
I... I didn't remember. I-I didn't...


560
00:43:20.629 --> 00:43:22.965
How the fuck do you forget
something like that?


561
00:43:22.965 --> 00:43:24.883
Clearly there's some memory issues
going on.


562
00:43:24.883 --> 00:43:25.801
Fuck off!

563
00:43:25.801 --> 00:43:28.178
[Frederic]
If you're having these symptoms, Jo,


564
00:43:28.178 --> 00:43:30.514
we can easily get you
the appropriate help.


565
00:43:30.514 --> 00:43:32.099
I need to talk to my husband.

566
00:43:32.599 --> 00:43:34.601
Get the fuck out of my house.

567
00:43:35.435 --> 00:43:36.561
Go!

568
00:43:36.561 --> 00:43:37.938
[Jo] I'm not crazy.

569
00:43:37.938 --> 00:43:39.898
Frederic, I work for you.

570
00:43:40.524 --> 00:43:41.900
This is my home.

571
00:43:41.900 --> 00:43:44.236
You don't belong here. 
I'm not at work.

572
00:43:46.822 --> 00:43:48.198
Fine.

573
00:43:49.157 --> 00:43:50.158
Fine.

574
00:43:52.619 --> 00:43:54.121
We'll go through HR tomorrow.

575
00:43:55.998 --> 00:43:59.042
It's good to have all this
out in the open though.

[door slams]

577
00:44:05.716 --> 00:44:06.883
I didn't lie to you.

578
00:44:06.883 --> 00:44:10.345
I am not a fucking fool.

579
00:44:11.054 --> 00:44:12.723
I... I... I didn't remember.

580

I don't remember. 
I don't remember!

581
00:44:17.853 --> 00:44:20.522
Maybe this isn't
the same fucking place that I left.


582

It's exactly the same, Jo!

Magnus. Where you taking her?

630
00:49:17.110 --> 00:49:18.612
Don't put her in a cupboard!

631
00:49:19.780 --> 00:49:22.282
- Don't put her in the fucking cupboard!
- [Alice] I want to.


632
00:49:22.783 --> 00:49:24.243
How is that gonna make things better?

633
00:49:24.243 --> 00:49:25.619
I want Daddy to tuck me in.

634
00:49:26.411 --> 00:49:30.249
- Don't put her in the fucking cupboard!
- She's scared of you, Jo. Okay?


635
00:49:30.249 --> 00:49:31.541
You're scaring her.

636
00:49:32.084 --> 00:49:34.253
Just go away. Go downstairs.

637
00:49:42.261 --> 00:49:44.137
- [Magnus] You okay, baby?
- [breathing heavily]


638
00:49:49.476 --> 00:49:50.811
[footsteps approaching]

639
00:49:52.646 --> 00:49:56.608
[Magnus] I mean, what were you doing? Hmm?

640
00:49:56.608 --> 00:49:59.069
Why are you putting her in the cupboard?

641
00:49:59.069 --> 00:50:01.029
She's scared. She wants to hide.

642
00:50:01.029 --> 00:50:02.447
How long has she been scared?

643
00:50:03.031 --> 00:50:04.074
How long do you think?

644
00:50:05.450 --> 00:50:07.869
Take the pills that Jenny gave you.

645
00:50:07.869 --> 00:50:09.204
You know what?

646
00:50:09.204 --> 00:50:13.792
- Those pills, they are antipsychotics.
- Of course they are. That's the point.


647
00:50:13.792 --> 00:50:16.253
No, no, no, wait.
[stammers] I mean, both are.


648
00:50:16.253 --> 00:50:18.964
The vitamins and... Both sets, they...
[stammers]


649
00:50:18.964 --> 00:50:22.884
There's a concerted effort to get me
on antipsychotic medication.


650
00:50:23.385 --> 00:50:25.721
They want to deny
what I saw up there.

651
00:50:25.721 --> 00:50:29.474
Just take the fucking pills, Jo.
[breathes heavily]


652
00:50:29.474 --> 00:50:30.559
What are you doing?

653
00:50:30.559 --> 00:50:33.228
I'm gonna call Frederic back
because he's... he's actually right.


654
00:50:33.228 --> 00:50:34.938
No, I need to sort this out.

655
00:50:35.480 --> 00:50:36.940
And you need to help me.

656
00:50:37.816 --> 00:50:39.776
I need to work
out why they're doing this.

657
00:50:39.776 --> 00:50:42.154
I am helping you, Jo.

658
00:50:44.406 --> 00:50:46.241
Why are you calling Frederic?

659
00:50:46.241 --> 00:50:49.036
I was the one that was
supposedly fucking him.


660
00:50:49.036 --> 00:50:50.120
Don't!

661
00:50:50.913 --> 00:50:54.541
[sniffles] I know you could all...
all hear me when I was up there.


662
00:50:55.083 --> 00:50:58.211
When I was up there and I was trying
to get back home and I was afraid,


663
00:50:58.211 --> 00:51:01.131
you could all hear me.
I heard those tapes.


664
00:51:01.131 --> 00:51:03.467
And you were gonna leave me
up there to die.


665
00:51:03.467 --> 00:51:04.384
Jo.

666
00:51:04.384 --> 00:51:06.053
- Put the phone down.
- I'm sorry.


667
00:51:06.053 --> 00:51:07.429
Put the fucking phone down.

668
00:51:07.429 --> 00:51:09.640
- I will... I will still be here!
- Put... [grunts]


669
00:51:09.640 --> 00:51:10.891
[shouts, grunts]

670
00:51:12.267 --> 00:51:13.310
[breathes heavily]

671
00:51:16.438 --> 00:51:19.858
- [line rings]
- [breathes heavily] Magnus?


672
00:51:43.548 --> 00:51:46.051
