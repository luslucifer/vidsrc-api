2
00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:24.561
Nobody's gonna believe me.

3
00:00:39.543 --> 00:00:40.645
I killed him.

4
00:00:45.617 --> 00:00:48.018
I killed my husband.

5
00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:51.723
But it wasn't him!

6
00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:54.558
It wasn't him!

7
00:01:00.732 --> 00:01:03.800
Sporting event, a
volunteer or church activity,


8
00:01:03.801 --> 00:01:04.768
- I'm recording here.
- Hi honey, look!


9
00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:07.070
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

10
00:01:07.071 --> 00:01:08.471
But look, I'm so excited.

11
00:01:08.472 --> 00:01:10.139
I got my new phone.

12
00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:11.207
Cool.

13
00:01:11.208 --> 00:01:12.042
Isn't it great?

14
00:01:12.043 --> 00:01:13.043
Yeah it's great.

15
00:01:13.044 --> 00:01:15.278
So listen,
I have this great idea.


16
00:01:16.313 --> 00:01:19.716
So our 25th anniversary's
coming up, right?


17
00:01:19.717 --> 00:01:20.784
Uh huh.

18
00:01:20.785 --> 00:01:23.252
And I'm gonna
take lots of footage


19
00:01:23.253 --> 00:01:25.521
and your present to me is you're
gonna


20
00:01:25.522 --> 00:01:27.156
string it together and put a
video


21
00:01:27.157 --> 00:01:28.892
so that we can give it to the
kids.


22
00:01:28.893 --> 00:01:30.459
Are you recording right now?

23
00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:31.293
Yeah.

24
00:01:31.294 --> 00:01:32.929
Okay, first lesson is

25
00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:34.098
you want it to be,

26
00:01:35.365 --> 00:01:38.068
there, so it's like landscape
instead of portrait.


27
00:01:38.069 --> 00:01:39.036
That's better.

28
00:01:39.037 --> 00:01:41.203
Second lesson is, why don't
you just use


29
00:01:41.204 --> 00:01:42.873
the camera that I already
have that you know


30
00:01:42.874 --> 00:01:43.907
how to use already?

31
00:01:43.908 --> 00:01:45.575
I don't really
know how to use it.


32
00:01:45.576 --> 00:01:47.744
It's big, it's very complicated.

33
00:01:47.745 --> 00:01:48.679
I'm not gonna just

34
00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:49.512
- do a
- Now honey look,


35
00:01:49.513 --> 00:01:50.513
- this is portable!
- Video for you


36
00:01:50.514 --> 00:01:51.782
for our anniversary.

37
00:01:51.783 --> 00:01:54.052
I mean I'm gonna do
something more than that.


38
00:01:54.919 --> 00:01:56.687
Look, this is all I
want, okay?


39
00:01:56.688 --> 00:01:59.455
This is portable, I can
take it wherever we go,


40
00:01:59.456 --> 00:02:01.557
I can just be spur of the
moment.


41
00:02:01.558 --> 00:02:03.860
And I get to work for our
anniversary?


42
00:02:03.861 --> 00:02:06.064
Oh come on
honey, please, for me?


43
00:02:07.765 --> 00:02:09.231
- Fine, okay.
- Thank you.


44
00:02:09.232 --> 00:02:10.232
No.

45
00:02:10.233 --> 00:02:11.935
No, I'm
serious, thank you honey.


46
00:02:11.936 --> 00:02:12.969
Sorry I interrupted you.

47
00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:14.905
You're thanking me
now.


48
00:02:14.906 --> 00:02:16.740
Wait until you're a client.

49
00:02:16.741 --> 00:02:18.976
Oh come on.

50
00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:21.845
You get two revisions!

51
00:02:21.846 --> 00:02:23.212
Oh stop.

52
00:02:26.617 --> 00:02:28.051
All right, it's on.

53
00:02:28.052 --> 00:02:28.886
Whoops.

54
00:02:30.822 --> 00:02:34.858
Okay,

55
00:02:34.859 --> 00:02:36.292
All right.

56
00:02:36.293 --> 00:02:37.227
Hi kitty.

57
00:02:39.229 --> 00:02:40.597
Oh my god!

58
00:02:40.598 --> 00:02:41.965
What?!

59
00:02:41.966 --> 00:02:42.933
You scared me.

60
00:02:42.934 --> 00:02:44.000
Honey, what do
you want to put,


61
00:02:44.001 --> 00:02:45.836
a trip to the emergency
room in this video?


62
00:02:45.837 --> 00:02:46.970
Well don't sneak up

63
00:02:46.971 --> 00:02:47.804
- on me like that.
- I wasn't sneaking up on you,


64
00:02:47.805 --> 00:02:50.207
I was just watching you.

65
00:02:50.208 --> 00:02:52.441
Well say something
next time.


66
00:02:52.442 --> 00:02:53.275
All right.

67
00:02:53.276 --> 00:02:55.779
Well, look, I just came
up to tell you


68
00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:58.182
that I ordered your
webcam for you.


69
00:02:59.217 --> 00:03:01.685
Thank you.

70
00:03:01.686 --> 00:03:03.755
You're welcome.

71
00:03:05.522 --> 00:03:06.957
Hey hon!

72
00:03:06.958 --> 00:03:08.391
Hi mom, how's it going?

73
00:03:09.359 --> 00:03:12.229
This is so cool, I can
actually see you.


74
00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:14.765
- Dad got me the webcam.
- I can see you too, mom, yeah.


75
00:03:14.766 --> 00:03:15.599
Yeah.

76
00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:17.500
I have a really cool idea.

77
00:03:17.501 --> 00:03:18.367
Okay?

78
00:03:18.368 --> 00:03:20.303
I want to do a V log.

79
00:03:21.672 --> 00:03:23.006
A V log?

80
00:03:23.007 --> 00:03:24.709
Are you talking about a vlog,
mom?


81
00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:27.510
Yeah, V log!

82
00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:31.148
Hold on a second.

83
00:03:31.149 --> 00:03:33.183
So anyway, I wanna do this thing

84
00:03:33.184 --> 00:03:35.919
but I can't figure
out how to get it


85
00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:37.989
you know, out there.

86
00:03:38.823 --> 00:03:40.624
Are you talking about?

87
00:03:40.625 --> 00:03:43.459
Because I can, I don't know,

88
00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:46.328
like I want lots of people
to see me, you know?


89
00:03:46.329 --> 00:03:49.232
Okay, so, were you thinking
about going,


90
00:03:49.233 --> 00:03:51.300
Like can you hook it up?

91
00:03:51.301 --> 00:03:53.737
I mean what do you hook
it up to, I'm not sure.


92
00:03:53.738 --> 00:03:56.305
Did you want to just
post videos on the internet


93
00:03:56.306 --> 00:03:59.744
or do you wanna stream
your vlogs or V logs?


94
00:04:01.679 --> 00:04:02.613
I don't know.

95
00:04:03.681 --> 00:04:04.513
Never mind.

96
00:04:04.514 --> 00:04:05.882
How about this, mom?

97
00:04:05.883 --> 00:04:08.718
Why don't I send you an
email with the instructions


98
00:04:08.719 --> 00:04:10.887
on how to get all that set up?

99
00:04:10.888 --> 00:04:13.657
And have dad help you out if
needed


100
00:04:13.658 --> 00:04:15.726
and yeah you
should be good to go.


101
00:04:17.061 --> 00:04:18.527
You got a hip mom, hon.

102
00:04:18.528 --> 00:04:21.798
All right, sweety, I'll
talk to you later, love you.


103
00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:22.933
All right, I love you too,
mom.


104
00:04:22.934 --> 00:04:23.768
Have a good one.

105
00:04:24.802 --> 00:04:27.838
Hi, I'm here to do
my first V log.


106
00:04:27.839 --> 00:04:30.006
This is kind of, let me
do it from the beginning


107
00:04:30.007 --> 00:04:31.709
'cause I wasn't looking at the
camera.


108
00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:37.215
Hi, my name is Vicky and
this is my very first V log.


109
00:04:38.716 --> 00:04:40.283
Why am I doing a V log?

110
00:04:40.284 --> 00:04:43.820
Well, you know my life is,

111
00:04:43.821 --> 00:04:46.156
I've got a new
chapter in my life.


112
00:04:46.157 --> 00:04:49.926
And I sort of wanna
document it, you know.


113
00:04:49.927 --> 00:04:53.230
The changes that
I'm going through.


114
00:04:53.231 --> 00:04:55.732
And I hope there's
somebody out there


115
00:04:55.733 --> 00:04:56.900
that I can share this with.

116
00:04:56.901 --> 00:05:00.437
That you know, we can sort
of do this journey together.


117
00:05:01.404 --> 00:05:02.873
My kids left home

118
00:05:02.874 --> 00:05:05.008
so I've got a new
chapter of my life,


119
00:05:05.009 --> 00:05:06.977
I'm an empty nester.

120
00:05:06.978 --> 00:05:11.983
And it's really, it's
kind of hard to adapt to.


121
00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:15.719
It's exciting but it's
challenging.


122
00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:20.290
It's like, you have to
develop new habits, you know.


123
00:05:20.291 --> 00:05:24.560
There was an ancient
Roman, his name was Seneca.


124
00:05:24.561 --> 00:05:29.566
And he said count
each day as a lifetime.


125
00:05:33.337 --> 00:05:34.403
All right, so all I
gotta figure out is how.


126
00:05:34.404 --> 00:05:37.274
Joe, okay, show
me again, show me again.


127
00:05:37.275 --> 00:05:39.944
Well I was just telling
you that, all right.


128
00:05:41.444 --> 00:05:43.713
You want stable.

129
00:05:43.714 --> 00:05:44.581
You want stable

130
00:05:44.582 --> 00:05:45.615
so I put this together.

131
00:05:45.616 --> 00:05:46.750
Why are you laughing?

132
00:05:46.751 --> 00:05:48.118
I put this together.

133
00:05:48.119 --> 00:05:50.020
Look, it's beautiful!

134
00:05:52.089 --> 00:05:53.123
Why are you laughing?

135
00:05:53.124 --> 00:05:54.691
Do you wanna do this right?

136
00:05:54.692 --> 00:05:56.126
I'm not giving up.

137
00:05:56.127 --> 00:05:57.193
You get this stable,

138
00:05:57.194 --> 00:05:58.261
I guarantee you, what
you're shooting right now,


139
00:05:58.262 --> 00:05:59.663
I don't know why
you're shooting this,


140
00:05:59.664 --> 00:06:01.998
but what you're
shooting right now


141
00:06:01.999 --> 00:06:04.301
is gonna be a lot less
stable than this is.


142
00:06:04.302 --> 00:06:07.503
You got your camera here,
your phone


143
00:06:07.504 --> 00:06:10.941
and then the light,
and you can adjust it.


144
00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:13.610
Look, you wanted me to do this,

145
00:06:13.611 --> 00:06:14.443
I'm gonna do it right.

146
00:06:14.444 --> 00:06:15.912
All I need to do is figure out

147
00:06:15.913 --> 00:06:18.447
how to get from the
XLR to the USB-C.


148
00:06:18.448 --> 00:06:19.416
Kevin?

149
00:06:19.417 --> 00:06:20.250
To put the audio into the
phone.


150
00:06:20.251 --> 00:06:21.318
- Kevin.
- What?


151
00:06:21.319 --> 00:06:23.386
I am not
carrying that thing around.


152
00:06:23.387 --> 00:06:25.487
Vicky, this is what
I do for a living.


153
00:06:25.488 --> 00:06:28.425
I am not walking
around with that thing.


154
00:06:28.426 --> 00:06:30.594
It's really pretty light.

155
00:06:32.063 --> 00:06:33.730
Look how stable this is.

156
00:06:33.731 --> 00:06:35.932
You're married to a
professional video person.


157
00:06:35.933 --> 00:06:38.134
You should use professional
gear if he's got it.


158
00:06:38.135 --> 00:06:39.468
Kevin, look at me.

159
00:06:39.469 --> 00:06:40.536
What?

160
00:06:40.537 --> 00:06:42.239
I am not
carrying that thing around.


161
00:06:43.774 --> 00:06:45.141
I bought a phone.

162
00:06:45.142 --> 00:06:47.377
You're complicating things,
honey.


163
00:06:47.378 --> 00:06:49.511
Honey, I'm not
complicating stuff.


164
00:06:49.512 --> 00:06:51.982
It's just the way, if you're
gonna do it,


165
00:06:51.983 --> 00:06:53.050
you do it right.

166
00:06:56.120 --> 00:06:58.456
I am not
carrying that thing around.


167
00:07:01.959 --> 00:07:04.095
It's a lot
lighter than it looks.


168
00:07:06.731 --> 00:07:07.564
See?

169
00:07:09.066 --> 00:07:09.900
Oh hey.

170
00:07:11.469 --> 00:07:12.469
There, see?

171
00:07:12.470 --> 00:07:14.070
This is ridiculous.

172
00:07:14.071 --> 00:07:15.238
You probably have to
hold it up


173
00:07:15.239 --> 00:07:16.840
just a little bit further

174
00:07:16.841 --> 00:07:18.975
so you can see the screen
clearer.


175
00:07:18.976 --> 00:07:20.210
Why are you laughing?

176
00:07:20.211 --> 00:07:21.378
I'm not carrying this around.

177
00:07:21.379 --> 00:07:22.245
I'm blind.

178
00:07:22.246 --> 00:07:23.046
I can't even see
if you're in focus.


179
00:07:23.047 --> 00:07:23.947
Oh you're in focus here.

180
00:07:23.948 --> 00:07:26.349
I am not carrying this around.

181
00:07:26.350 --> 00:07:29.052
And that just tightens
that down like that.


182
00:07:29.053 --> 00:07:30.754
Why are you recording this?

183
00:07:30.755 --> 00:07:32.554
That's the whole
point of this.


184
00:07:32.555 --> 00:07:34.758
Like doing behind the scenes?

185
00:07:34.759 --> 00:07:36.960
Of the 10 minute anniversary
video?


186
00:07:36.961 --> 00:07:38.962
I am trying to capture
our everyday life.


187
00:07:38.963 --> 00:07:40.163
Okay, okay, okay.

188
00:07:40.164 --> 00:07:44.701
So still, I mean I picked
this up, like 20 bucks, right.


189
00:07:44.702 --> 00:07:48.638
And then we still got lights,
all right.


190
00:07:48.639 --> 00:07:50.373
Look, I know you think it's
ridiculous


191
00:07:50.374 --> 00:07:51.875
but you're gonna be glad that
the picture


192
00:07:51.876 --> 00:07:54.511
isn't all grainy and that
stuff if it's low light.


193
00:07:54.512 --> 00:07:55.779
Okay.

194
00:07:55.780 --> 00:07:58.314
And if we wanna
record both of us


195
00:07:58.315 --> 00:07:59.749
you can just set it down there.

196
00:07:59.750 --> 00:08:00.583
I like that.

197
00:08:00.584 --> 00:08:01.418
- All right?
- Okay.


198
00:08:01.419 --> 00:08:03.887
And then I also got a clip on

199
00:08:03.888 --> 00:08:05.288
wide lens adapter.

200
00:08:05.289 --> 00:08:08.992
It's just, it's gonna be
a nicer, larger picture


201
00:08:08.993 --> 00:08:10.193
which will come in handy

202
00:08:10.194 --> 00:08:12.228
especially if we do stuff
down at the park or something.


203
00:08:12.229 --> 00:08:13.630
- Just to look nice.
- All right, Kevin?


204
00:08:13.631 --> 00:08:16.266
Fine, I will use your new rig.

205
00:08:16.267 --> 00:08:17.801
Are you happy?

206
00:08:17.802 --> 00:08:18.635
I'm happy.

207
00:08:18.636 --> 00:08:20.104
- I just want it to look nice.
- Okay.


208
00:08:21.372 --> 00:08:22.372
I said I'd use it.

209
00:08:22.373 --> 00:08:23.441
- Okay.
- All right.


210
00:08:28.879 --> 00:08:31.581
So you
just started up.


211
00:08:31.582 --> 00:08:34.751
You gotta light them both
independently


212
00:08:34.752 --> 00:08:37.788
but that's, now you can
do something at night.


213
00:08:39.790 --> 00:08:40.924
Take it, take it, take this!

214
00:08:40.925 --> 00:08:43.293
- Take it, take it!
- Oh god, what?


215
00:08:44.795 --> 00:08:45.629
Kevin!

216
00:09:01.378 --> 00:09:04.013
Here's something for your head.

217
00:09:04.014 --> 00:09:06.182
I don't think I need,
I don't need this.


218
00:09:06.183 --> 00:09:07.017
Well.

219
00:09:08.285 --> 00:09:09.119
Really, I'm feeling,

220
00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:11.321
I just don't want pills.

221
00:09:11.322 --> 00:09:12.989
I actually think
we need to go see a doctor.


222
00:09:12.990 --> 00:09:13.890
No we don't need
to see a doctor.


223
00:09:13.891 --> 00:09:15.525
I feel fine now,
I feel fine now.


224
00:09:15.526 --> 00:09:16.793
I don't know what it was.

225
00:09:16.794 --> 00:09:18.695
I feel fine now.

226
00:09:18.696 --> 00:09:19.629
Really.

227
00:09:19.630 --> 00:09:21.431
I appreciate what you're doing.

228
00:09:21.432 --> 00:09:23.667
Just, I don't need this.

229
00:09:24.902 --> 00:09:26.503
I'm probably just gonna put
on a movie or something.


230
00:09:26.504 --> 00:09:27.971
Yeah I mean,
that was pretty violent.


231
00:09:27.972 --> 00:09:29.140
I'm worried about you.

232
00:09:30.341 --> 00:09:31.841
Have you ever
had a migraine before?


233
00:09:31.842 --> 00:09:32.675
No.

234
00:09:32.676 --> 00:09:33.643
I've never had one.

235
00:09:33.644 --> 00:09:35.111
Maybe it was just a
migraine or something.


236
00:09:35.112 --> 00:09:36.847
People have
migraines all the time.


237
00:09:41.185 --> 00:09:43.120
Kevin, I don't think this is
working.


238
00:09:44.221 --> 00:09:46.524
All I can see is myself.

239
00:09:47.858 --> 00:09:49.826
Like your
reflection in the screen


240
00:09:49.827 --> 00:09:51.027
or something, or?

241
00:09:51.028 --> 00:09:53.164
No, all I can see is my face.

242
00:09:54.098 --> 00:09:56.799
Well it's probably
got the front camera.


243
00:09:56.800 --> 00:09:58.568
You need to switch it around.

244
00:09:58.569 --> 00:09:59.904
You need to turn it around.

245
00:10:00.804 --> 00:10:01.639
You need to spin it around,

246
00:10:01.640 --> 00:10:02.772
- the camera.
- Okay, okay, okay.


247
00:10:02.773 --> 00:10:04.107
No, not like, all right well,

248
00:10:04.108 --> 00:10:05.108
that's one way to do it

249
00:10:05.109 --> 00:10:06.442
but now you can't see.

250
00:10:06.443 --> 00:10:09.246
No, you need to,
there's a button.


251
00:10:11.682 --> 00:10:14.317
There, now it's, you
had to flip it around.


252
00:10:14.318 --> 00:10:16.153
- It's working now.
- Okay.


253
00:10:17.555 --> 00:10:20.324
So this is the park.

254
00:10:22.059 --> 00:10:23.826
You should be in there too.

255
00:10:23.827 --> 00:10:24.894
Let's get you too.

256
00:10:24.895 --> 00:10:26.963
It's about both of us, right?

257
00:10:26.964 --> 00:10:27.798
So there.

258
00:10:28.999 --> 00:10:31.100
I don't have any makeup on.

259
00:10:31.101 --> 00:10:32.735
You look fine.

260
00:10:34.705 --> 00:10:39.410
And our little
fake lighthouse here.


261
00:10:40.444 --> 00:10:42.212
It's not fake.

262
00:10:42.213 --> 00:10:43.447
Does it work?

263
00:10:44.616 --> 00:10:46.516
Well I mean I'm sure
it could,


264
00:10:46.517 --> 00:10:48.419
it's just what are
they gonna protect,


265
00:10:49.320 --> 00:10:52.121
fishing boats from Myer's point?

266
00:10:52.122 --> 00:10:54.058
Those lake pirates?

267
00:10:56.060 --> 00:10:59.829
Do you miss it, Robin?

268
00:10:59.830 --> 00:11:01.232
I miss you, baby.

269
00:11:04.235 --> 00:11:05.068
Definitely.

270
00:11:05.069 --> 00:11:06.537
I miss all my kids.

271
00:11:08.806 --> 00:11:09.641
Yeah.

272
00:11:13.544 --> 00:11:15.144
Yeah still, all of this

273
00:11:15.145 --> 00:11:16.913
used to be underwater.

274
00:11:16.914 --> 00:11:18.716
But summer's under way.

275
00:11:18.717 --> 00:11:19.849
Oh, speaking of that,

276
00:11:19.850 --> 00:11:22.252
remember when we
used to bring the kids


277
00:11:22.253 --> 00:11:23.920
down here to swim?

278
00:11:23.921 --> 00:11:26.290
Remember we used to bring
them down every summer?


279
00:11:27.324 --> 00:11:28.692
I remember.

280
00:11:28.693 --> 00:11:30.427
Yeah I kind
of miss that.


281
00:11:32.731 --> 00:11:33.864
But things change.

282
00:11:37.968 --> 00:11:39.803
Yeah, things change.

283
00:11:42.373 --> 00:11:43.539
Are you still recording?

284
00:11:43.540 --> 00:11:44.708
Mhmm.

285
00:11:44.709 --> 00:11:47.745
I just, can we just turn,

286
00:11:47.746 --> 00:11:48.679
turn it off?

287
00:11:48.680 --> 00:11:50.980
What's wrong?

288
00:11:50.981 --> 00:11:52.549
Don't be so grumpy.

289
00:11:57.087 --> 00:11:58.321
I'm not being grumpy,

290
00:11:58.322 --> 00:11:59.624
I just wish you would,

291
00:12:02.459 --> 00:12:04.628
all right, no keep rolling,
keep rolling.


292
00:12:04.629 --> 00:12:06.163
Here's me getting into the car.

293
00:12:07.131 --> 00:12:08.600
Oh come on, Kevin.

294
00:12:13.470 --> 00:12:15.972
Here she is,
hard at work


295
00:12:15.973 --> 00:12:18.609
on her clicky clicky keyboard

296
00:12:18.610 --> 00:12:23.012
on her amazing 21 nine monitor.

297
00:12:23.013 --> 00:12:23.980
I'm working.

298
00:12:23.981 --> 00:12:25.716
Compliments of yours
truly.


299
00:12:25.717 --> 00:12:26.550
I'm working.

300
00:12:27.518 --> 00:12:28.518
Well I thought
this is what it was


301
00:12:28.519 --> 00:12:31.888
supposed to be, is like
us in our daily lives


302
00:12:31.889 --> 00:12:33.222
so that we can remember

303
00:12:33.223 --> 00:12:35.225
back when we
were drooling in a cup.


304
00:12:36.795 --> 00:12:38.928
Okay, no yes.

305
00:12:38.929 --> 00:12:40.597
This is what we
used to do when we were


306
00:12:40.598 --> 00:12:42.332
- of full facilities.
- That is what I want.


307
00:12:42.333 --> 00:12:45.435
But right now I'm in
the middle of something.


308
00:12:45.436 --> 00:12:46.302
Well maybe
I'm trying to get


309
00:12:46.303 --> 00:12:47.672
in the middle of something.

310
00:12:48.606 --> 00:12:49.440
Kevin, go away.

311
00:12:50.709 --> 00:12:52.476
I thought we
were going to dinner.


312
00:12:53.645 --> 00:12:56.046
'Cause I was in the middle
of something too and,


313
00:12:57.582 --> 00:12:58.615
We are going to dinner.

314
00:12:58.616 --> 00:13:00.116
- If you give me...
- I quit


315
00:13:00.117 --> 00:13:02.553
'cause you told me that
I had to put on a shirt.


316
00:13:03.520 --> 00:13:05.154
They usually appreciate
that at restaurants.


317
00:13:05.155 --> 00:13:07.523
I had a shirt on.

318
00:13:07.524 --> 00:13:10.594
Just give me 10
minutes and I'll be down.


319
00:13:10.595 --> 00:13:12.362
Well then I'm gonna
get back to,


320
00:13:12.363 --> 00:13:14.197
I'm gonna get back to
what I was working on.


321
00:13:14.198 --> 00:13:15.431
10 minutes, I'm almost
finished.


322
00:13:15.432 --> 00:13:16.265
'Cause it's not
gonna be 10 minutes, Vicky.


323
00:13:16.266 --> 00:13:17.400
It's gonna be half an hour.

324
00:13:17.401 --> 00:13:20.269
I'm almost down with
scene, give me 10 minutes.


325
00:13:20.270 --> 00:13:21.638
I'll be down, I promise.

326
00:13:21.639 --> 00:13:22.472
All right.

327
00:13:22.473 --> 00:13:23.640
Now go away please.

328
00:13:23.641 --> 00:13:25.308
Well then I'm
just gonna set this down.


329
00:13:25.309 --> 00:13:27.077
You can do whatever
you want to do.


330
00:13:28.145 --> 00:13:29.278
Kevin.

331
00:13:29.279 --> 00:13:30.681
God.

332
00:13:30.682 --> 00:13:32.482
Find your way
out of that dark cloud


333
00:13:32.483 --> 00:13:33.784
and then change your life
significantly


334
00:13:33.785 --> 00:13:35.719
to find your way out of that
dark cloud


335
00:13:35.720 --> 00:13:37.019
and then change your life
significantly


336
00:13:37.020 --> 00:13:38.856
to find your way out of that
dark cloud.


337
00:13:38.857 --> 00:13:40.256
What?

338
00:13:40.257 --> 00:13:41.457
Kevin?

339
00:13:41.458 --> 00:13:42.392
Out of that dark cloud

340
00:13:42.393 --> 00:13:43.694
and then change your life
significantly


341
00:13:43.695 --> 00:13:45.696
to find your way out of that
dark cloud,


342
00:13:45.697 --> 00:13:46.929
What are you doing?

343
00:13:46.930 --> 00:13:48.531
To find your way
out of that dark cloud


344
00:13:48.532 --> 00:13:50.032
and then change your life
significantly


345
00:13:50.033 --> 00:13:51.033
to find your way...

346
00:13:51.034 --> 00:13:52.235
Hello?

347
00:13:52.236 --> 00:13:53.403
Kevin, I'm ready.

348
00:13:53.404 --> 00:13:54.705
To find your way
out of that dark cloud


349
00:13:54.706 --> 00:13:58.040
and change your life
significantly.


350
00:13:58.041 --> 00:13:58.876
Kevin.

351
00:13:58.877 --> 00:14:01.545
I wanted to ask you something.

352
00:14:02.614 --> 00:14:04.213
What?

353
00:14:04.214 --> 00:14:06.282
I was looking at your
video.


354
00:14:06.283 --> 00:14:07.184
Uh huh?

355
00:14:10.020 --> 00:14:14.557
My kids are finally gone, left
the house.


356
00:14:14.558 --> 00:14:19.563
And so I'm a, talk about the
days without the kids around.


357
00:14:20.732 --> 00:14:23.132
And if you empty nesters miss
the kids,


358
00:14:23.133 --> 00:14:24.167
but it's kind of exciting too.

359
00:14:24.168 --> 00:14:26.436
You keep talking
about like the kids gone


360
00:14:26.437 --> 00:14:28.371
but you're just so
bubbly about it.


361
00:14:28.372 --> 00:14:29.573
I mean is that,

362
00:14:29.574 --> 00:14:30.406
Well,
it's my first V log,


363
00:14:30.407 --> 00:14:33.444
I'm trying to be cheerful,
happy.


364
00:14:34.579 --> 00:14:38.649
But you're cheerful
about the kids being gone.


365
00:14:38.650 --> 00:14:42.151
My kids are
finally gone, left the house.


366
00:14:42.152 --> 00:14:44.187
Finally gone?

367
00:14:44.188 --> 00:14:46.590
Well that's a good
thing right?


368
00:14:46.591 --> 00:14:48.192
Without the kids around.

369
00:14:50.027 --> 00:14:51.294
The days without the kids
around.


370
00:14:51.295 --> 00:14:53.496
Miss the kids but
it's kind of exciting too.


371
00:14:53.497 --> 00:14:55.131
Kind of exciting.

372
00:14:55.132 --> 00:14:56.433
I mean really?

373
00:14:57.769 --> 00:14:59.603
I mean it was really exciting.

374
00:14:59.604 --> 00:15:01.672
I'll give you that, it
was really exciting,


375
00:15:01.673 --> 00:15:03.439
really exciting.

376
00:15:03.440 --> 00:15:06.309
Specially when one of them left,

377
00:15:06.310 --> 00:15:07.945
it was really exciting.

378
00:15:07.946 --> 00:15:09.646
I just, I don't get it.

379
00:15:09.647 --> 00:15:13.049
I don't get how you can be so

380
00:15:13.050 --> 00:15:15.384
just flippin' about it almost.

381
00:15:15.385 --> 00:15:18.387
Kevin, you
know I didn't mean that.


382
00:15:18.388 --> 00:15:19.222
Kids are gone!

383
00:15:19.223 --> 00:15:20.924
Kids are gone, empty nesters.

384
00:15:20.925 --> 00:15:23.894
I was talking
about Robin and Michelle.


385
00:15:23.895 --> 00:15:26.631
I know you were talking, well
you know,


386
00:15:28.700 --> 00:15:30.100
but there's another one too.

387
00:15:35.673 --> 00:15:38.575
So I looked up Dick in the
dictionary


388
00:15:38.576 --> 00:15:40.612
and there was a picture of me.

389
00:15:43.547 --> 00:15:44.381
I'm sorry.

390
00:15:45.683 --> 00:15:46.617
I'm sorry.

391
00:15:46.618 --> 00:15:48.886
I'm working on this,
I have my good days


392
00:15:48.887 --> 00:15:51.922
and my bad days, and I just
had a bad moment, that's all.


393
00:15:51.923 --> 00:15:52.757
I'm sorry.

394
00:15:54.391 --> 00:15:56.593
You have got to stop
taking this out on me.


395
00:15:56.594 --> 00:15:58.863
I'm not taking
anything out on you.


396
00:16:03.902 --> 00:16:05.802
Look, look.

397
00:16:05.803 --> 00:16:07.136
I'm sorry.

398
00:16:07.137 --> 00:16:08.471
Let's just put it behind us.

399
00:16:08.472 --> 00:16:09.539
Let's go to dinner.

400
00:16:09.540 --> 00:16:10.974
- We were gonna go to dinner.
- I'm making dinner.


401
00:16:10.975 --> 00:16:11.942
I'm making dinner.

402
00:16:11.943 --> 00:16:13.677
You're boiling water.

403
00:16:13.678 --> 00:16:15.812
Look, you've gotten dressed
up, let's go to dinner.


404
00:16:15.813 --> 00:16:17.582
I don't feel like going
anywhere.


405
00:16:18.448 --> 00:16:22.251
You don't
feel like creme brulee?


406
00:16:22.252 --> 00:16:23.587
'Cause I won't go buy
it for you this time.


407
00:16:23.588 --> 00:16:26.189
You have to go to the
restaurant in order to get it.


408
00:16:27.291 --> 00:16:32.296
Creme brulee, creme brulee.

409
00:16:32.897 --> 00:16:34.831
You know what?

410
00:16:34.832 --> 00:16:36.600
You are a dick.

411
00:16:36.601 --> 00:16:38.068
And you need a haircut.

412
00:16:41.538 --> 00:16:42.973
We're back.

413
00:16:42.974 --> 00:16:43.941
I see that!

414
00:16:43.942 --> 00:16:45.909
Oh Brian, did she like it?

415
00:16:45.910 --> 00:16:47.209
She loved it.

416
00:16:47.210 --> 00:16:50.447
I couldn't get her off the slot
machines, I gotta tell you.


417
00:16:51.381 --> 00:16:53.349
I'd love to have seen that.

418
00:16:53.350 --> 00:16:54.918
Yeah you would have liked it.

419
00:16:54.919 --> 00:16:56.019
She had a good time.

420
00:16:56.020 --> 00:16:59.388
We did a little bit of Lake
Mead and Mt. Charleston,


421
00:16:59.389 --> 00:17:00.289
some driving around too,

422
00:17:00.290 --> 00:17:01.892
but mostly Vegas.

423
00:17:01.893 --> 00:17:04.460
And it was a blast.

424
00:17:04.461 --> 00:17:06.730
Ah, I wish we could have come.

425
00:17:06.731 --> 00:17:09.231
Yeah, you got good color there.

426
00:17:09.232 --> 00:17:13.737
I wish we could have come but
you know, things, you know.


427
00:17:13.738 --> 00:17:14.638
I get it.

428
00:17:14.639 --> 00:17:16.205
But you know,
you guys were dealing,


429
00:17:16.206 --> 00:17:17.473
it was a tough year this year.

430
00:17:17.474 --> 00:17:18.507
You look good though.

431
00:17:18.508 --> 00:17:21.044
You look like
you're coming along.


432
00:17:21.045 --> 00:17:22.244
Thanks, thanks.

433
00:17:22.245 --> 00:17:24.246
Yeah and this is awesome.

434
00:17:24.247 --> 00:17:27.483
Welcome to the 21st century,
you with the webcam, huh?


435
00:17:27.484 --> 00:17:29.019
Yeah.

436
00:17:29.020 --> 00:17:31.054
I'm with it, right?

437
00:17:31.055 --> 00:17:32.254
No, it's good.

438
00:17:32.255 --> 00:17:34.091
Did Kevin set it all up for you?

439
00:17:34.092 --> 00:17:35.424
Of course.

440
00:17:35.425 --> 00:17:38.061
Yeah well, it's good
though, I like this.


441
00:17:38.062 --> 00:17:39.630
This is really good.

442
00:17:39.631 --> 00:17:40.698
So how's he doing?

443
00:17:43.233 --> 00:17:45.134
He's better, you know.

444
00:17:45.135 --> 00:17:47.104
The little recoup involved

445
00:17:47.105 --> 00:17:49.138
but he's doing a lot better.

446
00:17:49.139 --> 00:17:50.239
Good.

447
00:17:50.240 --> 00:17:52.441
I think it's gonna be okay.

448
00:17:52.442 --> 00:17:54.645
Good, glad to hear it.

449
00:17:54.646 --> 00:17:55.779
Hey, I'm heading out.

450
00:17:55.780 --> 00:17:58.649
I'm gonna attempt to
get a round of golf in,


451
00:17:58.650 --> 00:17:59.850
- it's a little wet, but,
- How can you do that


452
00:17:59.851 --> 00:18:01.217
with all this rain?

453
00:18:01.218 --> 00:18:03.120
It's not as bad as you think.

454
00:18:03.121 --> 00:18:04.955
I gotta start sometime.

455
00:18:04.956 --> 00:18:07.323
Season's just starting to crack
open here


456
00:18:07.324 --> 00:18:08.959
and I'm getting the bug.

457
00:18:08.960 --> 00:18:10.459
But I'd like dinner.

458
00:18:10.460 --> 00:18:12.294
Can we do dinner sometime?

459
00:18:12.295 --> 00:18:14.865
Sure, let's do it at
our place this time.


460
00:18:14.866 --> 00:18:16.099
Okay, sounds good.

461
00:18:16.100 --> 00:18:19.235
Okay well tell Becky I
said hi, give her my love.


462
00:18:19.236 --> 00:18:21.004
Okay, love you.

463
00:18:21.005 --> 00:18:21.972
Love you too.

464
00:18:21.973 --> 00:18:23.140
You know I hate doing this,

465
00:18:23.141 --> 00:18:24.074
I'm not a hairdresser.

466
00:18:24.075 --> 00:18:25.008
- It's not a big deal.
- All right.


467
00:18:25.009 --> 00:18:26.076
Just do around the ears.

468
00:18:26.077 --> 00:18:27.611
Well, be still.

469
00:18:27.612 --> 00:18:29.746
- I'm being still.
- Okay.


470
00:18:29.747 --> 00:18:32.349
Ow, don't kill me, god.

471
00:18:33.417 --> 00:18:35.686
Hold on, I gotta fix
something.


472
00:18:35.687 --> 00:18:36.519
What do you have

473
00:18:36.520 --> 00:18:37.788
- to fix?
- Just be still!


474
00:18:37.789 --> 00:18:38.822
- What do you have?
- Be still!


475
00:18:38.823 --> 00:18:40.057
- But you...
- Ah!


476
00:18:40.058 --> 00:18:41.825
What do you have to fix?

477
00:18:41.826 --> 00:18:46.328
You keep moving, it's like,

478
00:18:46.329 --> 00:18:48.497
What are you laugh?

479
00:18:52.737 --> 00:18:54.203
Look at me, honey.

480
00:18:54.204 --> 00:18:55.471
Look at you, look at you?

481
00:19:04.949 --> 00:19:08.685
How many hoops it's
gonna take to realize?


482
00:19:08.686 --> 00:19:10.721
I tried to fix it,
and you...


483
00:19:10.722 --> 00:19:11.822
How do you fix?

484
00:19:11.823 --> 00:19:13.724
Fix it, how do you fix it?

485
00:19:13.725 --> 00:19:15.391
You made it more.

486
00:19:15.392 --> 00:19:17.327
Maybe you
can comb it over.


487
00:19:21.331 --> 00:19:24.902
Comb it over?

488
00:19:26.604 --> 00:19:27.638
What, like this?

489
00:19:30.608 --> 00:19:33.144
Did you really just say comb it
over?


490
00:19:35.980 --> 00:19:38.116
Check out
his new look.


491
00:19:40.084 --> 00:19:42.251
Oh, it looks nice.

492
00:19:42.252 --> 00:19:47.225
I used to wear it almost
this short a while back.


493
00:19:48.092 --> 00:19:49.927
It's just weird, it's like,

494
00:19:54.665 --> 00:19:56.801
It's like somebody else
looking back at me.


495
00:20:04.742 --> 00:20:05.776
Hi honey,

496
00:20:05.777 --> 00:20:06.977
- how are you?
- Hey!


497
00:20:06.978 --> 00:20:09.545
I got a new webcam,
we can talk now.


498
00:20:09.546 --> 00:20:13.516
Yeah, it's like you're
here but you're not.


499
00:20:13.517 --> 00:20:15.451
I'm gonna do a V log.

500
00:20:15.452 --> 00:20:16.586
Are you gonna watch?

501
00:20:16.587 --> 00:20:19.123
V log, a vlog?

502
00:20:20.124 --> 00:20:23.226
Vlog, what's the difference?

503
00:20:23.227 --> 00:20:26.197
Never mind, yeah,
that sounds good.


504
00:20:27.098 --> 00:20:29.565
I will watch your V log.

505
00:20:29.566 --> 00:20:32.301
Okay good, good, I'm just
starting.


506
00:20:32.302 --> 00:20:33.737
You know, we'll get there.

507
00:20:33.738 --> 00:20:36.673
By the way, I love your haircut.

508
00:20:36.674 --> 00:20:37.506
Thank you.

509
00:20:37.507 --> 00:20:39.177
I actually cut it
the other night.


510
00:20:40.077 --> 00:20:41.579
How about this haircut, huh?

511
00:20:42.980 --> 00:20:43.880
Look at baldy.

512
00:20:43.881 --> 00:20:46.850
Your mother scalped me,
scalped me.


513
00:20:46.851 --> 00:20:48.251
Can you believe that?

514
00:20:48.252 --> 00:20:49.953
How many glasses of
wine did it take


515
00:20:49.954 --> 00:20:51.221
to get to that?

516
00:20:52.824 --> 00:20:53.990
None.

517
00:20:53.991 --> 00:20:57.359
He was being cheap
and he made me cut it


518
00:20:57.360 --> 00:20:58.995
and I told him I couldn't.

519
00:20:58.996 --> 00:21:00.730
Yeah so don't be
cheap around your mother


520
00:21:00.731 --> 00:21:02.166
or she'll buzz your head.

521
00:21:04.168 --> 00:21:06.937
Well, Dad, you get what you
pay for.


522
00:21:06.938 --> 00:21:07.938
Well he moved.

523
00:21:07.939 --> 00:21:09.372
I told him not to move.

524
00:21:13.244 --> 00:21:15.411
Anyway honey, I won't keep you.

525
00:21:15.412 --> 00:21:18.414
I just wanted to tell you about
my V log


526
00:21:18.415 --> 00:21:20.517
and wanted you to be sure and
watch it.


527
00:21:21.484 --> 00:21:22.319
All right, yeah no.

528
00:21:22.320 --> 00:21:23.253
Send my love to baldy

529
00:21:23.254 --> 00:21:25.690
and good luck with your V log.

530
00:21:26.891 --> 00:21:28.325
More people in
the middle of their lives


531
00:21:28.326 --> 00:21:31.427
find themselves without
a significant other.


532
00:21:31.428 --> 00:21:32.262
All right, handsome.

533
00:21:32.263 --> 00:21:33.430
Ready to go down?

534
00:21:39.170 --> 00:21:41.972
Can you give me like an hour?

535
00:21:41.973 --> 00:21:43.608
I can't, sorry.

536
00:21:44.876 --> 00:21:46.142
I got that guy coming to give me

537
00:21:46.143 --> 00:21:47.577
an estimate on the roof.

538
00:21:47.578 --> 00:21:48.679
Told them I'd be here.

539
00:21:52.049 --> 00:21:53.583
Okay look, don't worry about it.

540
00:21:53.584 --> 00:21:55.085
I'll go down by myself.

541
00:21:55.086 --> 00:21:56.186
Now I feel like a dick.

542
00:21:56.187 --> 00:21:57.988
Don't, it's
ridiculous.


543
00:21:57.989 --> 00:22:00.991
Look, it's okay,
go back to work.


544
00:22:00.992 --> 00:22:02.759
Oh, the cap's on.

545
00:22:02.760 --> 00:22:04.095
I can't see anything.

546
00:22:05.096 --> 00:22:06.897
Spring time!

547
00:22:06.898 --> 00:22:08.698
Saw my first
Robin the other day,


548
00:22:08.699 --> 00:22:10.466
I'm ridiculously happy.

549
00:22:10.467 --> 00:22:12.802
Last time we were
here it was overcast


550
00:22:12.803 --> 00:22:15.238
and windy and gross.

551
00:22:15.239 --> 00:22:19.209
This is a beautiful day so
I wanted you to see the park


552
00:22:19.210 --> 00:22:20.644
as it should be seen.

553
00:22:20.645 --> 00:22:24.614
Over there is the creek,
and the basketball court


554
00:22:24.615 --> 00:22:26.784
and of course
our beautiful lake.


555
00:22:28.319 --> 00:22:31.821
So this is the southern end
of the lake, of Cayuga Lake.


556
00:22:31.822 --> 00:22:34.424
And down at that
point is Ithaca.


557
00:22:36.327 --> 00:22:40.698
And it's our Myer's Point
lighthouse.


558
00:22:42.633 --> 00:22:45.001
And this is the northern end of
the lake.


559
00:22:45.002 --> 00:22:48.305
Around that point it
actually goes for 40 miles.


560
00:22:48.306 --> 00:22:50.440
It's the longest one of the
finger lakes.


561
00:22:52.143 --> 00:22:56.080
And it is such a beaut...

562
00:22:57.381 --> 00:22:58.349
Kevin?

563
00:23:02.086 --> 00:23:03.519
Kevin?

564
00:23:03.520 --> 00:23:05.122
I thought you didn't wanna come.

565
00:23:07.325 --> 00:23:08.626
Oh jeez.

566
00:23:12.330 --> 00:23:13.164
Kevin.

567
00:23:18.369 --> 00:23:19.303
Hello?

568
00:24:07.585 --> 00:24:09.518
When we have
beautiful days like this,


569
00:24:09.519 --> 00:24:10.552
spring days like this,

570
00:24:10.553 --> 00:24:12.323
you just gotta come down here.

571
00:24:24.769 --> 00:24:25.835
The simple fact is

572
00:24:25.836 --> 00:24:27.704
you have a lot to give
to the right person.


573
00:24:27.705 --> 00:24:31.141
The simple solution is,
single over 40.


574
00:24:31.142 --> 00:24:33.143
Single over 40
is a new service that...


575
00:24:33.144 --> 00:24:34.511
How did you do that?

576
00:24:34.512 --> 00:24:35.478
Do what?

577
00:24:35.479 --> 00:24:38.114
How'd you
get back here so fast?


578
00:24:38.115 --> 00:24:39.583
What are you talking about?

579
00:24:40.584 --> 00:24:42.852
You were just down.

580
00:24:42.853 --> 00:24:44.388
You were just down at the park.

581
00:24:46.257 --> 00:24:47.124
No I wasn't.

582
00:24:48.025 --> 00:24:49.125
Yes you were.

583
00:24:49.126 --> 00:24:50.193
Honey we talked
about this, I got,


584
00:24:50.194 --> 00:24:52.195
I saw you down there.

585
00:24:52.196 --> 00:24:54.597
It wasn't me.

586
00:24:54.598 --> 00:24:56.300
Kevin,
I swear to god.


587
00:24:58.102 --> 00:24:59.269
You were wearing
a different shirt


588
00:24:59.270 --> 00:25:01.472
but it looked just like you.

589
00:25:03.040 --> 00:25:06.843
Okay so I changed my clothes,
raced you down to the park,


590
00:25:06.844 --> 00:25:07.911
was down at the park

591
00:25:07.912 --> 00:25:10.613
and then raced back home,
changed my clothes again


592
00:25:10.614 --> 00:25:11.549
and now I'm here?

593
00:25:13.884 --> 00:25:15.318
This for 40 miles.

594
00:25:15.319 --> 00:25:17.654
The guy up on the
point there?


595
00:25:17.655 --> 00:25:18.888
That's not
a guy, that's a buoy.


596
00:25:18.889 --> 00:25:21.357
It's somebody
walking a dog.


597
00:25:21.358 --> 00:25:22.593
That guy.

598
00:25:25.463 --> 00:25:26.297
Kevin?

599
00:25:29.066 --> 00:25:30.434
Am I that fat?

600
00:25:31.335 --> 00:25:32.837
Oh stop, would you?

601
00:25:34.105 --> 00:25:36.575
We're not here to talk
about your physique.


602
00:25:38.542 --> 00:25:40.176
- Honey, it's,
- Kevin?


603
00:25:40.177 --> 00:25:41.044
I thought

604
00:25:41.045 --> 00:25:42.879
- you didn't wanna come.
- That's not me.


605
00:25:42.880 --> 00:25:44.180
That's not me, look.

606
00:25:44.181 --> 00:25:45.883
Wow, he went behind the thing.

607
00:25:48.519 --> 00:25:49.353
Right.

608
00:25:50.421 --> 00:25:53.056
- And I go looking for him.
- Right.


609
00:25:53.057 --> 00:25:54.091
And watch.

610
00:25:55.359 --> 00:25:56.193
Hello?

611
00:25:57.228 --> 00:25:59.396
Okay so he
walked back the other way.


612
00:26:00.498 --> 00:26:02.332
Yeah of course he
jumped into the water.


613
00:26:02.333 --> 00:26:03.934
I would have heard
that.


614
00:26:08.272 --> 00:26:12.041
Honey, he's gotta
be circling behind you.


615
00:26:12.042 --> 00:26:13.376
Well look.

616
00:26:13.377 --> 00:26:16.312
Do you see the shadow
of the lighthouse there?


617
00:26:16.313 --> 00:26:17.148
Hold on.

618
00:26:18.849 --> 00:26:19.883
I'd see his shadow.

619
00:26:19.884 --> 00:26:22.052
I don't see a shadow of a
person!


620
00:26:23.721 --> 00:26:24.954
I know I saw somebody.

621
00:26:24.955 --> 00:26:27.390
And I would hear
him if he were walking.


622
00:26:27.391 --> 00:26:28.691
I didn't hear any footsteps.

623
00:26:28.692 --> 00:26:32.495
Well he's gotta be on the
other side of the lighthouse.


624
00:26:32.496 --> 00:26:33.931
He's messing with you.

625
00:26:35.499 --> 00:26:36.866
He's messing with you!

626
00:26:36.867 --> 00:26:39.470
That's undeniable
because he disappeared.


627
00:26:42.072 --> 00:26:43.706
You don't see a
shadow, do you?


628
00:26:43.707 --> 00:26:44.874
No.

629
00:26:44.875 --> 00:26:46.109
All right,
I'll give you it's weird


630
00:26:46.110 --> 00:26:47.777
but there's an
explanation for it


631
00:26:47.778 --> 00:26:49.946
because people don't just
disappear.


632
00:26:49.947 --> 00:26:51.314
But that was not me.

633
00:26:51.315 --> 00:26:53.517
I was up there working
on that first video.


634
00:26:55.119 --> 00:26:57.453
Well I
see you again later.


635
00:26:57.454 --> 00:26:59.055
Now hold on.

636
00:26:59.056 --> 00:27:00.758
Forward it or
whatever.


637
00:27:01.725 --> 00:27:03.093
Gotta come down here.

638
00:27:03.994 --> 00:27:05.062
See, right there.

639
00:27:06.764 --> 00:27:08.064
Just staring at me.

640
00:27:08.065 --> 00:27:10.233
You were being so creepy!

641
00:27:10.234 --> 00:27:11.868
I'm not that.

642
00:27:11.869 --> 00:27:13.036
All right, zoom in.

643
00:27:13.037 --> 00:27:14.370
It's just some guy
that was messing with you.


644
00:27:14.371 --> 00:27:15.573
Zoom in.

645
00:27:15.574 --> 00:27:17.307
You can't do that
like they do in the movies.


646
00:27:17.308 --> 00:27:18.676
You can't just like zoom in

647
00:27:18.677 --> 00:27:20.810
and see a crystal clear picture.

648
00:27:20.811 --> 00:27:22.111
- From here,
- Zoom in.


649
00:27:22.112 --> 00:27:23.446
Even at 4k it's gonna,

650
00:27:23.447 --> 00:27:24.381
all right, hold on.

651
00:27:26.984 --> 00:27:28.484
Well it's
not very clear, is it?


652
00:27:28.485 --> 00:27:29.552
That's a bald guy

653
00:27:29.553 --> 00:27:32.188
and it looks like he's got a
goatee.


654
00:27:32.189 --> 00:27:34.257
When have I ever worn a long
sleeve shirt


655
00:27:34.258 --> 00:27:35.593
under a short sleeved shirt?

656
00:27:35.594 --> 00:27:37.060
Okay, all right, all
right.


657
00:27:37.061 --> 00:27:38.528
And I'm not that fat.

658
00:27:38.529 --> 00:27:40.631
I mean that's not me, Vicky.

659
00:27:40.632 --> 00:27:43.199
Well it looked
like you, it really did.


660
00:27:43.200 --> 00:27:44.602
Probably some motorcycle guy

661
00:27:44.603 --> 00:27:46.638
like they get down
there hanging out.


662
00:27:47.639 --> 00:27:49.340
It's a guy who's
messing with you.


663
00:27:51.275 --> 00:27:52.343
All right.

664
00:27:53.477 --> 00:27:54.545
It was weird though.

665
00:27:58.182 --> 00:27:59.283
It's not me.

666
00:28:05.055 --> 00:28:08.024
So spring came on a
Tuesday this year.


667
00:28:08.025 --> 00:28:09.025
Come on.

668
00:28:09.026 --> 00:28:09.959
Oh come on.

669
00:28:09.960 --> 00:28:12.996
It's been raining and
cold and miserable


670
00:28:12.997 --> 00:28:15.633
so it's still been winter
up until yesterday.


671
00:28:15.634 --> 00:28:17.567
Tomorrow it'll be 95 degrees.

672
00:28:17.568 --> 00:28:18.835
Stop being such a pessimist.

673
00:28:18.836 --> 00:28:20.370
It's a beautiful day.

674
00:28:20.371 --> 00:28:23.139
Can't you just enjoy it?

675
00:28:23.140 --> 00:28:24.575
It is pretty.

676
00:28:24.576 --> 00:28:25.842
It's gorgeous.

677
00:28:25.843 --> 00:28:28.878
You know Kev, you need to
learn to live in the moment


678
00:28:28.879 --> 00:28:31.781
a little bit more.

679
00:28:31.782 --> 00:28:32.750
Why are you laughing?

680
00:28:32.751 --> 00:28:33.751
I think you're
mugging for the kids


681
00:28:33.752 --> 00:28:36.019
or whoever you think's
gonna be watching this,


682
00:28:36.020 --> 00:28:37.553
this video of yours.

683
00:28:37.554 --> 00:28:39.956
- Hey, come on!
- Hey look, it's hey,


684
00:28:39.957 --> 00:28:42.058
- Look, look at it.
- It's upstate New York.


685
00:28:42.059 --> 00:28:44.360
Look at it, it's beautiful.

686
00:28:44.361 --> 00:28:45.664
It is beautiful.

687
00:28:46.731 --> 00:28:48.264
I will give you that.

688
00:28:48.265 --> 00:28:51.034
It's gorgeous, I mean
look at that sky.


689
00:28:51.035 --> 00:28:51.868
I saw it.

690
00:28:51.869 --> 00:28:52.771
It's like a painting.

691
00:28:57.107 --> 00:28:59.476
You mean like
one of Andy's paintings.


692
00:29:12.189 --> 00:29:14.091
It's time to talk about Andy.

693
00:29:17.861 --> 00:29:22.767
Our son Andy died a little
less than a year ago.


694
00:29:25.402 --> 00:29:26.638
He committed suicide.

695
00:29:34.411 --> 00:29:35.546
He was at art school.

696
00:29:43.354 --> 00:29:46.357
I remember that call
like it was yesterday.


697
00:29:51.962 --> 00:29:53.296
Course Kevin and I
got down there


698
00:29:53.297 --> 00:29:55.331
as fast as we could,

699
00:29:55.332 --> 00:29:57.467
but there's nothing we could do.

700
00:29:57.468 --> 00:30:00.537
Except the stuff you do
after somebody's died.


701
00:30:03.006 --> 00:30:05.942
We talked to the boy who lived

702
00:30:05.943 --> 00:30:07.311
in the room next to his.

703
00:30:08.580 --> 00:30:11.948
And he said he thought that Andy

704
00:30:11.949 --> 00:30:16.185
was talking to somebody the
night he killed himself.


705
00:30:16.186 --> 00:30:17.655
And he thought it was Kevin.

706
00:30:20.958 --> 00:30:24.729
It's not possible, Kevin was
in Philadelphia on a shoot.


707
00:30:26.263 --> 00:30:27.866
So it couldn't have been him.

708
00:30:32.169 --> 00:30:36.574
Always wonder what could
have gone through his mind


709
00:30:39.243 --> 00:30:41.311
to make him do
something like that.


710
00:30:47.551 --> 00:30:48.685
It's been really hard,

711
00:30:48.686 --> 00:30:53.591
but I think it's been
especially hard on Kevin.


712
00:30:55.526 --> 00:30:56.628
He just...

713
00:31:00.364 --> 00:31:01.964
I guess I don't know.

714
00:31:01.965 --> 00:31:04.034
We'll never get used to it,
either of us.


715
00:31:07.070 --> 00:31:09.273
It just found a deep
place in Kevin's heart


716
00:31:10.441 --> 00:31:12.009
and he just hasn't healed.

717
00:31:20.618 --> 00:31:21.719
It's so weird.

718
00:31:23.454 --> 00:31:27.324
Sometimes I catch myself
looking at the front door.


719
00:31:31.663 --> 00:31:35.766
And thinking that Andy
will just come breezing in


720
00:31:35.767 --> 00:31:36.935
like he used to.

721
00:31:40.270 --> 00:31:41.940
But that's never
gonna happen again.


722
00:31:51.816 --> 00:31:53.149
The thing that's
really cool about these lights


723
00:31:53.150 --> 00:31:54.885
other than them being small

724
00:31:54.886 --> 00:31:57.287
is that they match the
daylight temperature.


725
00:31:59.356 --> 00:32:00.556
You know what?

726
00:32:00.557 --> 00:32:02.660
Yeah I know what,
you got a cat on your head.


727
00:32:04.929 --> 00:32:05.995
I don't feel like cooking.

728
00:32:05.996 --> 00:32:07.431
We are going to dinner.

729
00:32:08.332 --> 00:32:09.398
All right, we can
go to dinner, that's fine.


730
00:32:09.399 --> 00:32:10.366
Okay great.

731
00:32:10.367 --> 00:32:13.169
You know what, you take
that stupid hat off.


732
00:32:13.170 --> 00:32:15.105
And I will go change.

733
00:32:19.777 --> 00:32:21.278
Turn the lights off.

734
00:32:25.349 --> 00:32:27.918
Okay, so I
thought I'd bring the camera


735
00:32:27.919 --> 00:32:30.687
and film us on the way to the
restaurant.


736
00:32:30.688 --> 00:32:31.989
Hey, how come you're not...

737
00:32:31.990 --> 00:32:34.591
What is this?

738
00:32:34.592 --> 00:32:36.259
What is this?

739
00:32:36.260 --> 00:32:38.494
Why did you do this?

740
00:32:38.495 --> 00:32:40.097
I didn't do anything.

741
00:32:41.231 --> 00:32:42.498
Why did you do this, Vicky?

742
00:32:42.499 --> 00:32:44.200
Why did you bring this back
upstairs?


743
00:32:44.201 --> 00:32:46.737
I put this away for a reason,
all right?


744
00:32:46.738 --> 00:32:47.906
I didn't.

745
00:32:50.374 --> 00:32:51.808
Put it in my chair.

746
00:32:51.809 --> 00:32:54.043
Look, I'll tell you something.

747
00:32:54.044 --> 00:32:56.013
And I know what you're thinking.

748
00:32:56.014 --> 00:32:57.714
That I just wanna forget him,
all right?


749
00:32:57.715 --> 00:33:00.149
I don't wanna forget him, okay?

750
00:33:00.150 --> 00:33:02.753
I'm going to deal with it the
way that I


751
00:33:02.754 --> 00:33:04.821
need to deal with it, all right?

752
00:33:04.822 --> 00:33:06.055
It's what I told you in the
hospital,


753
00:33:06.056 --> 00:33:07.858
and I'm trying.

754
00:33:07.859 --> 00:33:10.259
But I can't just be surrounded
by this.


755
00:33:10.260 --> 00:33:12.528
I can't be surrounded
by him and reminders


756
00:33:12.529 --> 00:33:14.530
and you wanna turn this
whole place into a shrine!


757
00:33:14.531 --> 00:33:16.132
I don't,
that's not fair.


758
00:33:16.133 --> 00:33:17.333
This is mine.

759
00:33:17.334 --> 00:33:20.503
He did it for me, and if I
wanna put it away for a while


760
00:33:20.504 --> 00:33:22.538
or forever, that's my business.

761
00:33:22.539 --> 00:33:23.539
I didn't do anything.

762
00:33:23.540 --> 00:33:25.742
Well what do you think,
I did it?


763
00:33:25.743 --> 00:33:27.109
I didn't do it.

764
00:33:27.110 --> 00:33:28.612
You had to have done it!

765
00:33:28.613 --> 00:33:29.913
I didn't.

766
00:33:29.914 --> 00:33:32.248
Somebody put this in my chair!

767
00:33:32.249 --> 00:33:34.216
It was in the trunk
with the rest of his things!


768
00:33:34.217 --> 00:33:35.986
I know it was!

769
00:33:35.987 --> 00:33:37.821
Where I put it, where
it should have stayed


770
00:33:37.822 --> 00:33:39.656
until I decided to bring it out.

771
00:33:39.657 --> 00:33:40.624
Not you.

772
00:33:40.625 --> 00:33:42.726
Not you because you don't agree

773
00:33:42.727 --> 00:33:44.427
with the way that
I'm processing this,


774
00:33:44.428 --> 00:33:45.762
the way I'm dealing with this.

775
00:33:45.763 --> 00:33:47.698
Drinking myself half to
death and all that stuff


776
00:33:47.699 --> 00:33:49.800
and whatever, okay fine.

777
00:33:49.801 --> 00:33:51.835
Fine, that was a mistake.

778
00:33:51.836 --> 00:33:53.570
But I still need to process it

779
00:33:53.571 --> 00:33:55.504
the way that I
need to process it.


780
00:33:55.505 --> 00:33:56.907
And I just sit there and just

781
00:33:56.908 --> 00:33:57.774
flagrantly put this...

782
00:33:57.775 --> 00:33:59.843
I didn't do that!

783
00:33:59.844 --> 00:34:01.011
I would never do that!

784
00:34:01.012 --> 00:34:03.446
Who did it then?!

785
00:34:03.447 --> 00:34:04.649
I don't know.

786
00:34:08.418 --> 00:34:09.252
Oh jeez.

787
00:34:11.055 --> 00:34:12.521
You know.

788
00:34:12.522 --> 00:34:16.459
You know I'm right about this.

789
00:34:16.460 --> 00:34:17.861
You can't let this go.

790
00:34:17.862 --> 00:34:19.229
Just different for me.

791
00:34:21.099 --> 00:34:22.733
But you can't let it go either.

792
00:34:22.734 --> 00:34:24.969
And this is horseshit.

793
00:34:32.342 --> 00:34:34.177
God, I really miss him.

794
00:34:37.280 --> 00:34:39.282
I so miss him every day.

795
00:34:52.362 --> 00:34:54.932
Kevin, he just,

796
00:34:57.167 --> 00:34:58.567
I know he feels the same way

797
00:34:58.568 --> 00:35:00.202
but he just wants to,

798
00:35:00.203 --> 00:35:03.407
it's like he just wants to get
rid of him.


799
00:35:05.576 --> 00:35:08.412
I can't do that, he was my baby.

800
00:35:11.049 --> 00:35:14.584
I still need him around

801
00:35:14.585 --> 00:35:18.122
even if it's just the
picture or an old shirt.


802
00:35:19.757 --> 00:35:21.826
And I can't even
bring up his name!


803
00:35:33.104 --> 00:35:34.806
But I also understand.

804
00:35:35.907 --> 00:35:39.309
I still have two children
here and they need us.


805
00:35:41.211 --> 00:35:42.913
And we have to go on for them.

806
00:35:42.914 --> 00:35:45.549
It's not fair to them otherwise.

807
00:35:50.788 --> 00:35:51.922
When things like this happen,

808
00:35:51.923 --> 00:35:53.924
I don't know what to do.

809
00:35:53.925 --> 00:35:55.492
I have nobody to talk to.

810
00:36:00.297 --> 00:36:02.466
Oh god, I miss him so much.

811
00:36:04.969 --> 00:36:05.870
I miss him.

812
00:36:34.331 --> 00:36:35.332
Looks really good.

813
00:36:36.266 --> 00:36:37.135
Thank you.

814
00:36:53.217 --> 00:36:54.218
Look, Vic.

815
00:36:55.485 --> 00:36:58.455
I know I'm not always
very good at


816
00:37:01.759 --> 00:37:04.327
demonstrating how
much you mean to me.


817
00:37:12.270 --> 00:37:15.006
But you are very
important to me.


818
00:37:17.675 --> 00:37:20.978
I just don't show it the
way I should all the time.


819
00:37:35.993 --> 00:37:38.395
While you were making dinner,

820
00:37:40.731 --> 00:37:45.703
this is the footage of that
party from last summer of him.


821
00:37:51.508 --> 00:37:53.611
I'm sorry I made you cry.

822
00:38:19.136 --> 00:38:21.171
Whatcha doin'?

823
00:38:21.172 --> 00:38:23.505
I just wanted to mow

824
00:38:23.506 --> 00:38:26.375
but it's still so wet.

825
00:38:26.376 --> 00:38:27.612
It's cold too.

826
00:38:29.213 --> 00:38:30.615
Hey listen, you know,

827
00:38:33.483 --> 00:38:34.918
it just feels like things are
getting


828
00:38:34.919 --> 00:38:36.452
a little tense
around here, you know?


829
00:38:36.453 --> 00:38:38.021
I'm not tense.

830
00:38:38.022 --> 00:38:41.523
Look, I think, we've
been in the house too much.


831
00:38:41.524 --> 00:38:42.759
I know we've been working

832
00:38:42.760 --> 00:38:45.128
but I think we should just
get out of here for a while.


833
00:38:45.129 --> 00:38:46.495
Let's go to dinner or
something.


834
00:38:46.496 --> 00:38:49.165
No, I mean get
out of here for a while,


835
00:38:49.166 --> 00:38:51.668
just get in the car,

836
00:38:51.669 --> 00:38:53.203
No, I don't wanna do that.

837
00:38:53.204 --> 00:38:54.704
Kevin, it would be
good for us.


838
00:38:54.705 --> 00:38:55.537
- I got things to do.
- Let's just get out


839
00:38:55.538 --> 00:38:56.373
of here for a while.

840
00:38:56.374 --> 00:38:58.108
I don't wanna go anywhere.

841
00:38:58.109 --> 00:38:58.942
Why?

842
00:38:58.943 --> 00:39:00.076
You're between jobs

843
00:39:00.077 --> 00:39:02.178
- right now.
- I'm not going anywhere.


844
00:39:02.179 --> 00:39:03.313
Kevin,
I think it'll be


845
00:39:03.314 --> 00:39:05.116
- good for...
- I'm not going anywhere.


846
00:39:07.251 --> 00:39:08.586
Okay.

847
00:39:12.857 --> 00:39:14.091
It's beautiful.

848
00:39:15.626 --> 00:39:16.694
Yes, it is.

849
00:39:20.131 --> 00:39:22.633
Part of having a dog.

850
00:39:24.335 --> 00:39:26.370
Best part of this, for sure.

851
00:39:27.371 --> 00:39:28.905
Thanks.

852
00:39:28.906 --> 00:39:30.240
Reminds me of when we,

853
00:39:30.241 --> 00:39:33.009
I don't think I
ever told you this.


854
00:39:33.010 --> 00:39:34.377
The boys and I were out here

855
00:39:34.378 --> 00:39:36.213
walking along the tracks one
time and


856
00:39:37.982 --> 00:39:39.749
we got to the bridge.

857
00:39:39.750 --> 00:39:43.353
And there's this loaded
diaper on the bridge.


858
00:39:43.354 --> 00:39:45.989
And of course Andy doesn't
pay it any attention.


859
00:39:45.990 --> 00:39:48.524
Robin goes and
investigates it then


860
00:39:48.525 --> 00:39:49.960
being Robin, he's like,

861
00:39:49.961 --> 00:39:52.362
"Dad, do you think
there's a baby?


862
00:39:52.363 --> 00:39:53.663
"I mean, were they
changing a baby


863
00:39:53.664 --> 00:39:56.633
"on the bridge,
on the train bridge?"


864
00:39:56.634 --> 00:39:58.368
and then turned into like,

865
00:39:58.369 --> 00:39:59.669
"Is there a homeless
family out here


866
00:39:59.670 --> 00:40:02.372
"or is there a
baby lost out here?"


867
00:40:02.373 --> 00:40:04.074
I mean just all of that

868
00:40:04.075 --> 00:40:07.143
and then quiet for a minute or
so and then


869
00:40:07.144 --> 00:40:09.646
Andy all of a sudden
turns around and he says,


870
00:40:09.647 --> 00:40:14.150
"Bro, sometimes shit
just happens."


871
00:40:14.151 --> 00:40:16.953
Sounds like him.

872
00:40:31.635 --> 00:40:35.039
You think the dead ever think
about us?


873
00:40:52.256 --> 00:40:53.123
What are you doing?

874
00:40:53.124 --> 00:40:55.025
I'm putting on a cover for the
game.


875
00:40:55.026 --> 00:40:57.526
No, we don't need
that.


876
00:40:57.527 --> 00:40:58.928
Why are you taping this?

877
00:40:58.929 --> 00:41:01.865
You're not gonna film us
playing cards, are you?


878
00:41:01.866 --> 00:41:02.832
Yeah.

879
00:41:02.833 --> 00:41:03.834
Honey, nobody,

880
00:41:04.935 --> 00:41:06.202
this is for us and I don't care

881
00:41:06.203 --> 00:41:09.506
about watching us
and Jody and Lonnie


882
00:41:09.507 --> 00:41:11.441
- playing cards together.
- I care.


883
00:41:11.442 --> 00:41:12.509
- First of all,
- Could you help me here?


884
00:41:12.510 --> 00:41:14.177
No, I don't want that
on.


885
00:41:14.178 --> 00:41:15.412
That's stupid-looking.

886
00:41:15.413 --> 00:41:18.748
It's a top for,
it's a gaming top.


887
00:41:18.749 --> 00:41:20.750
It's so it protects
your table top.


888
00:41:20.751 --> 00:41:21.718
It's stupid.

889
00:41:21.719 --> 00:41:22.853
It's not stupid.

890
00:41:24.855 --> 00:41:28.024
Right, laugh, that's
fine, that's just funny.


891
00:41:28.025 --> 00:41:29.325
Could you help me here?

892
00:41:29.326 --> 00:41:30.293
- It's going on.
- No!


893
00:41:30.294 --> 00:41:32.096
I don't want it there.

894
00:41:33.597 --> 00:41:34.432
Kevin?

895
00:41:36.033 --> 00:41:36.866
Ow!

896
00:41:36.867 --> 00:41:37.802
Oh my god.

897
00:41:38.903 --> 00:41:40.570
Kevin, Kevin, Kevin.

898
00:41:40.571 --> 00:41:41.405
What's wrong?

899
00:41:42.907 --> 00:41:45.108
Honey, what's wrong?

900
00:41:45.109 --> 00:41:48.044
It's just that
headache again.


901
00:41:48.045 --> 00:41:49.045
Oh my god.

902
00:41:49.046 --> 00:41:51.014
Kevin, we've gotta
go see a doctor.


903
00:41:51.015 --> 00:41:52.615
I'm not going
to see a doctor.


904
00:41:52.616 --> 00:41:53.483
Then let's go

905
00:41:53.484 --> 00:41:54.417
- to the hospital.
- People get headaches.


906
00:41:54.418 --> 00:41:56.152
- This might be serious!
- Like I told you,


907
00:41:56.153 --> 00:41:57.620
it's just probably a
migraine or something.


908
00:41:57.621 --> 00:41:58.922
It's not a big deal.

909
00:41:58.923 --> 00:42:00.623
Migraines don't work
like this.


910
00:42:00.624 --> 00:42:01.458
The other one went away,

911
00:42:01.459 --> 00:42:02.292
this one will go away.

912
00:42:02.293 --> 00:42:04.028
Just stop.

913
00:42:04.895 --> 00:42:07.831
Kevin, this is important.

914
00:42:07.832 --> 00:42:09.467
You need to see somebody.

915
00:42:58.215 --> 00:42:59.049
Kevin!

916
00:43:00.017 --> 00:43:00.851
Stop it!

917
00:43:04.121 --> 00:43:06.023
Kevin, cut it out!

918
00:43:09.894 --> 00:43:12.496
Dammit Kevin, this is
pissing me off, quit it.


919
00:43:16.734 --> 00:43:17.835
What's wrong with you?

920
00:43:33.717 --> 00:43:36.520
He has been really behaving
strangely.


921
00:43:38.222 --> 00:43:40.391
And you know what, it's
not the first time.


922
00:43:42.026 --> 00:43:43.360
When Andy died,

923
00:43:45.262 --> 00:43:48.566
Kevin buried
himself in a bottle.


924
00:43:49.400 --> 00:43:50.568
Many bottles.

925
00:43:51.702 --> 00:43:55.005
He went on a drinking bender
like you couldn't believe.


926
00:43:55.906 --> 00:43:58.509
And you know what, he
ended up in the hospital.


927
00:44:00.978 --> 00:44:04.748
His behavior was just so
erratic during that time.


928
00:44:06.483 --> 00:44:08.551
And he's starting to remind me,

929
00:44:08.552 --> 00:44:11.020
I'm starting to see some
of those same behaviors


930
00:44:11.021 --> 00:44:12.722
coming up again.

931
00:44:12.723 --> 00:44:15.259
And it's really scaring me a
little bit.


932
00:44:21.799 --> 00:44:23.900
I don't think he's drinking
again.


933
00:44:23.901 --> 00:44:26.637
I don't think that he
would ever go back there.


934
00:44:26.638 --> 00:44:28.272
He knows he'd die if he did.

935
00:44:30.341 --> 00:44:32.076
I don't think he's there yet.

936
00:44:37.781 --> 00:44:39.717
But he's behaving like that.

937
00:44:39.718 --> 00:44:41.586
He's reminding me of those days.

938
00:44:43.287 --> 00:44:45.022
And I really don't
know what to do.


939
00:44:58.369 --> 00:45:01.804
I thought you said dinner
was gonna be special tonight.


940
00:45:01.805 --> 00:45:03.007
Well what do you want?

941
00:45:04.008 --> 00:45:05.074
Steak?

942
00:45:05.075 --> 00:45:06.710
Steak?

943
00:45:06.711 --> 00:45:07.543
Yeah.

944
00:45:07.544 --> 00:45:09.113
Honey, you don't eat beef.

945
00:45:10.514 --> 00:45:12.316
You haven't had beef for months.

946
00:45:13.718 --> 00:45:15.653
Since it's special,
I thought steak.


947
00:45:15.654 --> 00:45:17.254
Steak is usually pretty special.

948
00:45:20.625 --> 00:45:21.759
I didn't know that.

949
00:45:21.760 --> 00:45:24.895
I mean, okay, we can have
steak tomorrow night then.


950
00:45:26.430 --> 00:45:30.434
This is fine.

951
00:45:38.108 --> 00:45:38.942
Sorry.

952
00:46:04.835 --> 00:46:06.103
Steak tomorrow.

953
00:46:10.207 --> 00:46:12.175
I gotta talk to you about
something.


954
00:46:12.176 --> 00:46:13.010
Yeah.

955
00:46:14.044 --> 00:46:16.280
Well, it's about Kevin.

956
00:46:17.114 --> 00:46:20.016
He's been behaving really weird.

957
00:46:20.017 --> 00:46:22.986
He's been doing some
bizarre things lately.


958
00:46:24.254 --> 00:46:25.456
Well you know, I mean,

959
00:46:26.624 --> 00:46:27.457
he's just processing things

960
00:46:27.458 --> 00:46:29.326
I'm sure still with Andy.

961
00:46:31.462 --> 00:46:34.297
You cope with it differently.

962
00:46:34.298 --> 00:46:36.332
You talked it out

963
00:46:36.333 --> 00:46:39.803
and he's internalizing
a lot of stuff, so.


964
00:46:39.804 --> 00:46:40.804
I know.

965
00:46:40.805 --> 00:46:42.438
I know but Brian, last night,

966
00:46:42.439 --> 00:46:45.642
he shoved a bowl
of pasta in my lap.


967
00:46:45.643 --> 00:46:48.244
I mean, it's weird behavior

968
00:46:48.245 --> 00:46:51.615
but I'm starting to
detect a little more anger


969
00:46:51.616 --> 00:46:53.384
than is normal for him.

970
00:46:55.018 --> 00:46:56.452
I've known Kevin
almost 30 years.


971
00:46:56.453 --> 00:46:58.790
I mean that just doesn't
seem like him at all.


972
00:47:02.059 --> 00:47:04.260
Why don't you guys
get away from things?


973
00:47:04.261 --> 00:47:06.529
You know, maybe take an
overnight,


974
00:47:06.530 --> 00:47:08.665
go up to the falls or something?

975
00:47:08.666 --> 00:47:10.533
Thing is, I tried that.

976
00:47:10.534 --> 00:47:12.402
I tried to get him to
go away for a weekend


977
00:47:12.403 --> 00:47:13.269
and he was adamant.

978
00:47:13.270 --> 00:47:15.739
He refuses to leave.

979
00:47:15.740 --> 00:47:17.473
It's like he's attached
to the house


980
00:47:17.474 --> 00:47:19.008
and won't leave it.

981
00:47:19.009 --> 00:47:21.412
I can barely get him to
go to the store with me.


982
00:47:23.615 --> 00:47:25.281
All right, well.

983
00:47:25.282 --> 00:47:26.650
I don't know.

984
00:47:26.651 --> 00:47:28.084
I think it would be good
to get away from there.


985
00:47:28.085 --> 00:47:29.853
I think there's reminders.

986
00:47:29.854 --> 00:47:31.622
I just think he needs a fresh,

987
00:47:31.623 --> 00:47:33.357
maybe start smaller, you know.

988
00:47:34.358 --> 00:47:35.726
Go down the lake or something.

989
00:47:35.727 --> 00:47:37.059
Try again.

990
00:47:37.060 --> 00:47:39.495
But let me know if this
continues


991
00:47:39.496 --> 00:47:41.931
'cause I mean,
this is atypical for him.


992
00:47:41.932 --> 00:47:44.101
So I don't know.

993
00:47:45.235 --> 00:47:46.135
Well maybe you're right.

994
00:47:46.136 --> 00:47:49.740
Maybe since he's
so opposed to it,


995
00:47:49.741 --> 00:47:51.541
instead of going away for
a weekend or something,


996
00:47:51.542 --> 00:47:54.177
we can just take, I
don't know, an afternoon,


997
00:47:54.178 --> 00:47:55.978
go to the falls or something
maybe.


998
00:47:55.979 --> 00:47:57.480
It's a good idea.

999
00:47:57.481 --> 00:47:58.347
Okay.

1000
00:47:58.348 --> 00:48:00.082
I know, I'm kind
of dumping stuff.


1001
00:48:00.083 --> 00:48:02.219
No, no, no I
get it, I get it.

1002
00:48:03.520 --> 00:48:04.655
It's good, you can.

1003
00:48:04.656 --> 00:48:07.825
Hey, I still like this
communication with the webcam


1004
00:48:07.826 --> 00:48:10.059
so feel free to reach out to me
anytime.


1005
00:48:10.060 --> 00:48:11.762
Okay thank you, I appreciate
that.


1006
00:48:11.763 --> 00:48:12.629
All right.

1007
00:48:12.630 --> 00:48:13.529
Love you, sis.

1008
00:48:13.530 --> 00:48:14.364
Love you too.

1009
00:48:17.434 --> 00:48:19.136
Hey, Kevin, listen.

1010
00:48:24.676 --> 00:48:25.509
Kevin.

1011
00:48:28.178 --> 00:48:29.446
Hey hon, I wanted,

1012
00:48:32.483 --> 00:48:33.317
Kevin?

1013
00:48:40.825 --> 00:48:41.492
Kevin.

1014
00:49:01.011 --> 00:49:02.012
How does he keep?

1015
00:49:07.351 --> 00:49:08.185
Kevin!

1016
00:49:11.255 --> 00:49:12.089
Would you stop?

1017
00:49:16.426 --> 00:49:17.629
Kevin!

1018
00:49:20.430 --> 00:49:21.966
You're freaking me out here.

1019
00:49:23.300 --> 00:49:25.302
What are you doing
in the dark basement?


1020
00:49:27.437 --> 00:49:29.238
Kevin!

1021
00:49:29.239 --> 00:49:30.675
Would you please answer me?

1022
00:49:44.889 --> 00:49:46.223
This isn't funny anymore.

1023
00:50:09.781 --> 00:50:10.815
How'd you do that?

1024
00:50:11.649 --> 00:50:13.449
Dammit Kevin, I have been
chasing you


1025
00:50:13.450 --> 00:50:14.450
all over this house.

1026
00:50:14.451 --> 00:50:16.153
Why didn't you answer me?

1027
00:50:18.155 --> 00:50:20.390
Honey, I've been here for
quite a while.


1028
00:50:24.094 --> 00:50:25.329
Wait a minute.

1029
00:50:31.101 --> 00:50:33.103
Hey, look at me.

1030
00:50:35.472 --> 00:50:36.306
What?

1031
00:50:39.443 --> 00:50:40.277
What?

1032
00:50:42.479 --> 00:50:45.049
Nothing, never mind.

1033
00:50:50.487 --> 00:50:51.321
Kevin?

1034
00:50:55.059 --> 00:50:56.027
What are you doing?

1035
00:50:57.795 --> 00:50:58.630
Kevin.

1036
00:51:03.433 --> 00:51:04.467
Hey!

1037
00:51:04.468 --> 00:51:05.302
Oh god.

1038
00:51:07.071 --> 00:51:08.640
What are you doing?

1039
00:51:14.511 --> 00:51:15.345
Watching TV.

1040
00:51:17.280 --> 00:51:18.448
The TV's not on.

1041
00:51:23.320 --> 00:51:25.322
Kevin, the TV is not on.

1042
00:51:29.192 --> 00:51:30.994
Look, it's late.

1043
00:51:30.995 --> 00:51:33.031
Come on, let's go to bed.

1044
00:51:36.166 --> 00:51:37.001
Okay.

1045
00:51:39.169 --> 00:51:40.270
I've got your water.

1046
00:51:48.245 --> 00:51:49.080
Come on.

1047
00:51:52.050 --> 00:51:53.985
Here, here's the water.

1048
00:52:58.548 --> 00:53:00.051
Hey you, let's go to the park.

1049
00:53:00.918 --> 00:53:03.120
I don't feel
like going to the park.


1050
00:53:03.121 --> 00:53:04.921
What's wrong?

1051
00:53:04.922 --> 00:53:08.725
Just my
shoulder's hurting again.


1052
00:53:08.726 --> 00:53:10.193
That knot of yours?

1053
00:53:10.194 --> 00:53:11.027
Yeah.

1054
00:53:11.028 --> 00:53:12.163
All right, sit down.

1055
00:53:13.231 --> 00:53:14.363
Sit down.

1056
00:53:14.364 --> 00:53:15.532
I'll rub your shoulder.

1057
00:53:16.566 --> 00:53:17.835
It's not gonna hurt.

1058
00:53:19.704 --> 00:53:20.804
It won't hurt.

1059
00:53:20.805 --> 00:53:22.774
Come on, it'll might make you
feel better.


1060
00:53:26.077 --> 00:53:27.276
There, right?

1061
00:53:27.277 --> 00:53:28.979
Yeah, now it's the same.

1062
00:53:28.980 --> 00:53:29.813
It's the same thing that I had

1063
00:53:29.814 --> 00:53:30.881
right before we got married

1064
00:53:30.882 --> 00:53:32.816
where I couldn't even
move my neck for two days.


1065
00:53:32.817 --> 00:53:34.518
Oh god, I remember that.

1066
00:53:35.753 --> 00:53:38.789
I also remember that's
when you started drinking.


1067
00:53:38.790 --> 00:53:41.290
Why would you say that?

1068
00:53:41.291 --> 00:53:43.093
Because that's what happened?

1069
00:53:43.094 --> 00:53:45.061
Why would you suggest
that I have a drink?


1070
00:53:45.062 --> 00:53:46.062
- I didn't!
- You were there


1071
00:53:46.063 --> 00:53:47.631
when the doctor said I
could never drink again.


1072
00:53:47.632 --> 00:53:49.565
Remember my whole
new list of nevers


1073
00:53:49.566 --> 00:53:50.901
that I have to deal with?

1074
00:53:50.902 --> 00:53:52.102
Kevin, I wasn't suggesting...

1075
00:53:52.103 --> 00:53:54.503
I'm serious though,
why would you do that?


1076
00:53:54.504 --> 00:53:55.538
I didn't!

1077
00:53:55.539 --> 00:53:57.908
You know how
sensitive that is for me.


1078
00:53:57.909 --> 00:53:59.075
I didn't suggest

1079
00:53:59.076 --> 00:54:00.476
- you have a drink!
- I can never drink again,


1080
00:54:00.477 --> 00:54:01.377
- why would you say.
- I know that.


1081
00:54:01.378 --> 00:54:03.713
You just sat here,
you just sat here


1082
00:54:03.714 --> 00:54:05.215
and said that I had.

1083
00:54:05.216 --> 00:54:06.515
I am not
doing this with you.


1084
00:54:06.516 --> 00:54:09.418
You suggested that
I have a drink!


1085
00:54:09.419 --> 00:54:12.388
Like I did back then,
yes you did!


1086
00:54:12.389 --> 00:54:13.456
I did not.

1087
00:54:14.659 --> 00:54:16.893
You know what, what does
the doctor know, right?


1088
00:54:16.894 --> 00:54:18.262
Fine, fine.

1089
00:54:19.130 --> 00:54:20.030
The hell with him.

1090
00:54:20.031 --> 00:54:21.264
- Make me a drink.
- No.


1091
00:54:21.265 --> 00:54:22.632
Make me a drink,
is that what you want?


1092
00:54:22.633 --> 00:54:23.499
Make me a drink.

1093
00:54:23.500 --> 00:54:24.333
No!

1094
00:54:24.334 --> 00:54:25.168
Make me a drink!

1095
00:54:25.169 --> 00:54:26.570
Make me a drink right now!

1096
00:54:26.571 --> 00:54:28.138
Make me a drink!

1097
00:54:28.139 --> 00:54:29.405
Like one of those big tall ones

1098
00:54:29.406 --> 00:54:31.141
that you sucked down every
night!


1099
00:54:31.142 --> 00:54:32.108
Five or six of them!

1100
00:54:32.109 --> 00:54:33.409
- I do not.
- While you're making dinner!


1101
00:54:33.410 --> 00:54:34.244
You exaggerate.

1102
00:54:34.245 --> 00:54:35.213
Make me a drink!

1103
00:54:36.981 --> 00:54:40.116
And while you're at it, while
you're checking things off,


1104
00:54:40.117 --> 00:54:42.152
my list of nevers,
why don't you give me


1105
00:54:42.153 --> 00:54:44.321
five more minutes
with my dead kid?


1106
00:54:44.322 --> 00:54:45.155
Kevin!

1107
00:54:45.156 --> 00:54:46.923
Conjure that one up!

1108
00:54:46.924 --> 00:54:48.557
Let's just take care of the
whole list


1109
00:54:48.558 --> 00:54:50.127
of nevers all at once.

1110
00:54:53.430 --> 00:54:56.000
Can't believe you just
said I should have a drink.


1111
00:54:57.702 --> 00:55:00.370
I can't believe
you just said what you did.


1112
00:55:07.945 --> 00:55:09.546
I mean look at him.

1113
00:55:10.681 --> 00:55:12.115
He just, he doesn't do this.

1114
00:55:12.116 --> 00:55:14.951
He doesn't garden, he never
does this kind of thing.


1115
00:55:14.952 --> 00:55:17.419
Maybe he's just
getting some exercise


1116
00:55:17.420 --> 00:55:19.222
and you know,
wants to garden now.


1117
00:55:19.223 --> 00:55:20.090
Brian, no,

1118
00:55:20.091 --> 00:55:22.260
this is really out of character
for him.


1119
00:55:23.728 --> 00:55:25.195
Is he drinking again?

1120
00:55:25.196 --> 00:55:26.964
No, no, I know that.

1121
00:55:28.165 --> 00:55:29.033
Well I mean,

1122
00:55:30.902 --> 00:55:34.571
after Andy passed, did
he get some medication


1123
00:55:34.572 --> 00:55:36.106
that he started to take?

1124
00:55:36.107 --> 00:55:38.141
No, no they
didn't give him anything.


1125
00:55:38.142 --> 00:55:39.276
Is he taking anything though,

1126
00:55:39.277 --> 00:55:40.944
- something else?
- No, I don't think so.


1127
00:55:40.945 --> 00:55:41.779
I really don't.

1128
00:55:42.880 --> 00:55:44.546
Hmm, I mean
could be work, you know?


1129
00:55:44.547 --> 00:55:47.217
A lot of stress from.

1130
00:55:47.218 --> 00:55:49.120
Nothing unusual's
going on.


1131
00:55:51.255 --> 00:55:52.390
I don't know, I mean.

1132
00:55:55.525 --> 00:55:57.128
It's still maybe just a process.

1133
00:55:57.995 --> 00:55:59.095
Okay well, look.

1134
00:55:59.096 --> 00:56:02.366
Do me a favor,
would you go talk to him?


1135
00:56:03.566 --> 00:56:04.466
Yeah, yeah.

1136
00:56:04.467 --> 00:56:05.402
I mean
he's not just really


1137
00:56:05.403 --> 00:56:07.070
communicating
with me these days.


1138
00:56:07.071 --> 00:56:08.738
I don't know what's going on.

1139
00:56:08.739 --> 00:56:10.040
Maybe he'll talk to you.

1140
00:56:10.041 --> 00:56:11.708
All right, I'll go out.

1141
00:56:11.709 --> 00:56:12.842
Do me another favor,

1142
00:56:12.843 --> 00:56:15.845
would you take the camera,
I would like to have this.


1143
00:56:15.846 --> 00:56:17.380
You mean, and record him?

1144
00:56:17.381 --> 00:56:18.949
Yeah, just
film the whole thing.


1145
00:56:18.950 --> 00:56:20.618
Yeah, it won't hurt, all
right.


1146
00:56:27.524 --> 00:56:28.426
- Hey Kevin.
- Hey.


1147
00:56:29.293 --> 00:56:30.261
What you doin', man?

1148
00:56:32.396 --> 00:56:33.797
Not a whole lot.

1149
00:56:33.798 --> 00:56:35.365
She's got you
doing that too, huh?


1150
00:56:35.366 --> 00:56:36.867
Yeah, I.

1151
00:56:38.135 --> 00:56:39.936
It's like you gotta have it.

1152
00:56:39.937 --> 00:56:41.503
If you're related to me
you gotta have a camera


1153
00:56:41.504 --> 00:56:43.606
before you can talk to me
anymore, it feels like.


1154
00:56:43.607 --> 00:56:45.608
She's always got
that thing on me.


1155
00:56:45.609 --> 00:56:47.844
Ah, she's into it,
I don't know


1156
00:56:47.845 --> 00:56:50.146
Like a neat little hobby or
something for her to do, right?


1157
00:56:50.147 --> 00:56:51.248
Yeah I guess so.

1158
00:56:52.950 --> 00:56:54.318
What are you putting
a flower bed in?


1159
00:56:56.420 --> 00:56:57.420
No I'm just,

1160
00:56:57.421 --> 00:56:59.657
I'm gonna plant something,
I'm just not sure.


1161
00:57:01.392 --> 00:57:03.093
You, know, just felt like

1162
00:57:03.094 --> 00:57:05.663
digging and planting something.

1163
00:57:06.998 --> 00:57:10.601
But not, I said not
sure what I'm gonna do.


1164
00:57:11.969 --> 00:57:13.270
I mean, I just felt like

1165
00:57:14.672 --> 00:57:16.941
four of something here'll
probably work.


1166
00:57:18.009 --> 00:57:20.343
Just to fill this in
'cause this is all,


1167
00:57:20.344 --> 00:57:21.778
can't dig over there 'cause
that's,


1168
00:57:21.779 --> 00:57:24.047
I mean there's about six or
seven pets


1169
00:57:24.048 --> 00:57:25.182
buried over there, but.

1170
00:57:26.283 --> 00:57:29.019
Over here is just sort of dead.

1171
00:57:29.020 --> 00:57:31.155
Just thought I'd plant
something.


1172
00:57:33.491 --> 00:57:35.192
Four seemed like the right
number.


1173
00:57:36.427 --> 00:57:38.328
I mean I've got room for a fifth
one here


1174
00:57:38.329 --> 00:57:42.967
if I decide to depending
on what I wanna plant.


1175
00:57:45.836 --> 00:57:47.904
So you're staying for dinner?

1176
00:57:47.905 --> 00:57:49.339
Yeah.

1177
00:57:49.340 --> 00:57:50.174
Good.

1178
00:57:53.543 --> 00:57:55.212
Let me know if I can
help you.


1179
00:57:58.115 --> 00:57:59.250
I think I'm good.

1180
00:58:06.424 --> 00:58:07.758
What?

1181
00:58:20.738 --> 00:58:21.572
Oh god.

1182
00:58:24.241 --> 00:58:25.409
Where are you going?

1183
00:58:27.945 --> 00:58:28.779
Kevin!

1184
00:58:30.948 --> 00:58:31.782
Oh jeez.

1185
00:58:33.084 --> 00:58:35.920
He doesn't even have his keys.

1186
00:58:50.801 --> 00:58:51.635
Hey Kevin.

1187
00:58:54.839 --> 00:58:58.308
How do you
start this thing?


1188
00:58:58.309 --> 00:59:01.010
How'd you do that?

1189
00:59:01.011 --> 00:59:01.879
Do what?!

1190
00:59:02.880 --> 00:59:05.014
You were
just in the car!


1191
00:59:05.015 --> 00:59:05.916
No I wasn't.

1192
00:59:09.820 --> 00:59:11.222
How do you start this thing?

1193
00:59:13.724 --> 00:59:15.091
What is the big deal, what?

1194
00:59:15.092 --> 00:59:17.760
The big deal is
that you were in two places


1195
00:59:17.761 --> 00:59:18.696
at once, Kevin.

1196
00:59:19.997 --> 00:59:20.864
This again.

1197
00:59:20.865 --> 00:59:22.232
Vickie, I wasn't in two places
at once.


1198
00:59:22.233 --> 00:59:24.734
You were there
and then you were over there.


1199
00:59:24.735 --> 00:59:25.568
Where is there?

1200
00:59:25.569 --> 00:59:27.103
Here in the kitchen?

1201
00:59:27.104 --> 00:59:28.171
You were in the car

1202
00:59:28.172 --> 00:59:30.874
and all of a sudden
you're by the tree.


1203
00:59:30.875 --> 00:59:32.008
Vickie, I was just in the
garage


1204
00:59:32.009 --> 00:59:32.942
and I was trying to get,

1205
00:59:32.943 --> 00:59:34.978
Okay, we're gonna
look at this footage


1206
00:59:34.979 --> 00:59:35.812
and I'm gonna

1207
00:59:35.813 --> 00:59:36.646
- prove it to you.
- I'm not looking.


1208
00:59:36.647 --> 00:59:38.181
I want to get the lawn mowed.

1209
00:59:38.182 --> 00:59:40.251
We're looking at this
footage.


1210
00:59:43.354 --> 00:59:44.188
Fine.

1211
00:59:45.389 --> 00:59:46.422
You know it's the first day in
three weeks


1212
00:59:46.423 --> 00:59:47.290
that it hasn't been raining

1213
00:59:47.291 --> 00:59:49.526
and I'm in here doing this crap

1214
00:59:49.527 --> 00:59:51.494
instead of out there
mowing like I should be.


1215
00:59:51.495 --> 00:59:53.597
Okay so I'm in the side yard.

1216
00:59:53.598 --> 00:59:55.599
You've got the camera on
me all the time these days


1217
00:59:55.600 --> 00:59:58.636
so what's the big deal?

1218
00:59:58.637 --> 01:00:00.171
All right,
go to the end.


1219
01:00:01.505 --> 01:00:02.939
I'm in the side yard!

1220
01:00:02.940 --> 01:00:04.175
Go to the end.

1221
01:00:06.043 --> 01:00:06.877
See?

1222
01:00:09.180 --> 01:00:11.582
Look, maybe your app
has a stitch feature to it.


1223
01:00:11.583 --> 01:00:12.549
This is a different day.

1224
01:00:12.550 --> 01:00:13.584
That's today.

1225
01:00:13.585 --> 01:00:15.485
- I'd give you that.
- No, it's all the same day.


1226
01:00:15.486 --> 01:00:17.788
- Vicky.
- Go back and fast forward.


1227
01:00:22.826 --> 01:00:24.260
All right, I
don't remember doing this


1228
01:00:24.261 --> 01:00:25.762
- but still, it doesn't mean...
- Fast forward.


1229
01:00:25.763 --> 01:00:26.630
Fine!

1230
01:00:26.631 --> 01:00:27.598
Really?

1231
01:00:27.599 --> 01:00:28.498
Kevin!

1232
01:00:28.499 --> 01:00:31.001
Oh jeez, he doesn't have keys.

1233
01:00:32.336 --> 01:00:33.169
Now watch.

1234
01:00:33.170 --> 01:00:34.170
Hey Kevin.

1235
01:00:34.171 --> 01:00:35.405
How do you start this
thing?


1236
01:00:35.406 --> 01:00:36.240
See?

1237
01:00:39.644 --> 01:00:40.878
Explain that please.

1238
01:01:00.264 --> 01:01:01.098
Hey Brian.

1239
01:01:02.066 --> 01:01:03.100
Hey Vickie.

1240
01:01:04.568 --> 01:01:05.868
I have to talk to you about
something


1241
01:01:05.869 --> 01:01:08.172
very, very strange that
happened.


1242
01:01:09.206 --> 01:01:11.474
The other day I
was taping Kevin.


1243
01:01:11.475 --> 01:01:12.810
He was in the driveway,

1244
01:01:13.811 --> 01:01:17.313
gesticulating wildly
and talking to nobody.


1245
01:01:17.314 --> 01:01:19.282
And then suddenly he was there.

1246
01:01:19.283 --> 01:01:21.451
And almost no time elapsed.

1247
01:01:21.452 --> 01:01:23.954
He was here and
then he was there.


1248
01:01:25.356 --> 01:01:27.925
It was like he was in
two places at one time.


1249
01:01:30.261 --> 01:01:31.828
Right, well I mean,

1250
01:01:31.829 --> 01:01:35.198
we know somebody can't be
two places at one time.


1251
01:01:35.199 --> 01:01:37.767
And I'll grant you, I've
seen him acting strange.


1252
01:01:37.768 --> 01:01:39.502
He's almost doing a little bit

1253
01:01:39.503 --> 01:01:40.770
of a bipolar thing.

1254
01:01:40.771 --> 01:01:43.642
I mean you look a
little worried though.


1255
01:01:46.010 --> 01:01:49.545
Well, what I
really would like to do here


1256
01:01:49.546 --> 01:01:51.414
is show you the footage.

1257
01:01:51.415 --> 01:01:53.283
But he went in and
he got my phone


1258
01:01:53.284 --> 01:01:55.151
and he took it off.

1259
01:01:55.152 --> 01:01:57.820
So that I don't even
have any proof anymore.


1260
01:01:57.821 --> 01:01:59.188
I don't know where
he keeps his stuff


1261
01:01:59.189 --> 01:02:01.524
so I can't even show it to you.

1262
01:02:01.525 --> 01:02:03.727
And I know you're not gonna
take my word for it Brian


1263
01:02:03.728 --> 01:02:05.528
but this really happened.

1264
01:02:05.529 --> 01:02:07.930
And it's scaring me!

1265
01:02:07.931 --> 01:02:10.234
No I believe
something's happening.


1266
01:02:11.502 --> 01:02:12.336
I see that.

1267
01:02:13.705 --> 01:02:14.971
Just, I mean you still
have your camera


1268
01:02:14.972 --> 01:02:16.373
and all your gear, right?

1269
01:02:17.274 --> 01:02:18.575
Why don't you document some
more?


1270
01:02:18.576 --> 01:02:20.744
I don't know if you remember
Tim, he's my neighbor.


1271
01:02:20.745 --> 01:02:22.512
He's a psychiatrist.

1272
01:02:22.513 --> 01:02:24.080
You do some documentation

1273
01:02:24.081 --> 01:02:26.215
and then we'll meet up

1274
01:02:26.216 --> 01:02:27.450
and maybe we'll show it to him

1275
01:02:27.451 --> 01:02:29.352
and just see what his
professional opinion is.


1276
01:02:29.353 --> 01:02:31.120
'Cause I still think this is
some sort


1277
01:02:31.121 --> 01:02:32.822
of a bipolar episode.

1278
01:02:32.823 --> 01:02:35.693
Maybe something to
do with the loss


1279
01:02:35.694 --> 01:02:37.696
and the coping he's
still going through.


1280
01:02:38.562 --> 01:02:40.263
You know what,
I get that.


1281
01:02:40.264 --> 01:02:41.497
And I thought that.

1282
01:02:41.498 --> 01:02:44.000
I thought that maybe
he should see somebody.


1283
01:02:44.001 --> 01:02:45.703
But Brian, I'm telling you

1284
01:02:45.704 --> 01:02:48.005
this is just really hard to
describe, but


1285
01:02:48.972 --> 01:02:51.008
there's something
more going on here.


1286
01:02:52.109 --> 01:02:53.910
Something really weird.

1287
01:02:53.911 --> 01:02:55.211
Vickie, you're
worrying me.


1288
01:02:55.212 --> 01:02:57.281
I mean do we want to call the
authorities?


1289
01:02:58.248 --> 01:03:01.084
No, you mean
like the pol-, no.


1290
01:03:01.085 --> 01:03:02.952
I mean,
I'll come over.


1291
01:03:02.953 --> 01:03:04.354
Let me come over.

1292
01:03:04.355 --> 01:03:07.691
No, I don't think so.

1293
01:03:07.692 --> 01:03:10.493
Honestly I don't think
that would help right now.


1294
01:03:10.494 --> 01:03:11.327
I appreciate it.

1295
01:03:11.328 --> 01:03:12.730
All right, well look.

1296
01:03:12.731 --> 01:03:14.397
I'm 20 minutes away.

1297
01:03:14.398 --> 01:03:16.466
If you ever feel
like you need me,


1298
01:03:16.467 --> 01:03:18.368
you call me and I'll be over.

1299
01:03:18.369 --> 01:03:20.738
In the meantime, just document
everything


1300
01:03:20.739 --> 01:03:21.971
that's going on.

1301
01:03:21.972 --> 01:03:25.008
Hide it so I can take
a look at it this time.


1302
01:03:26.477 --> 01:03:27.811
Well I have to hide
my phone


1303
01:03:27.812 --> 01:03:28.879
but I'll do that.

1304
01:03:29.947 --> 01:03:31.447
- Thank you.
- Well yeah, yeah.


1305
01:03:31.448 --> 01:03:32.883
- Okay.
- Thank you.


1306
01:03:33.951 --> 01:03:36.353
All right, be safe.

1307
01:03:40.124 --> 01:03:41.626
Nobody's gonna believe me.

1308
01:04:04.081 --> 01:04:05.416
Well I'm here now, right?

1309
01:04:07.184 --> 01:04:09.687
Who knows where else
I am right now.


1310
01:04:12.089 --> 01:04:14.358
I am trying really
hard to figure this out.


1311
01:04:15.827 --> 01:04:17.862
I mean two places at
once, it just, it doesn't.


1312
01:04:20.330 --> 01:04:23.734
I went online and I've
been doing some research.


1313
01:04:23.735 --> 01:04:24.869
I keep looking at it.

1314
01:04:27.938 --> 01:04:31.140
I'm in the side yard and I
don't remember that at all.


1315
01:04:31.141 --> 01:04:34.410
Don't remember out there
carrying on like that.


1316
01:04:34.411 --> 01:04:36.780
Kevin mentioned once to me
this kind of


1317
01:04:36.781 --> 01:04:39.883
off the cuff remark
about maybe at the park


1318
01:04:39.884 --> 01:04:41.418
I saw his doppelgĂ¤nger.

1319
01:04:43.655 --> 01:04:46.456
Looking it up, it also means
evil twin.


1320
01:04:46.457 --> 01:04:47.291
That's me.

1321
01:04:48.125 --> 01:04:53.162
I came across
this medieval legend,


1322
01:04:53.163 --> 01:04:54.465
the legend of Gwenyd.

1323
01:04:55.733 --> 01:04:58.535
And she lost her lover in
battle.


1324
01:04:59.369 --> 01:05:01.971
And it says heart broken,
she longed


1325
01:05:01.972 --> 01:05:03.841
to escape this world.

1326
01:05:03.842 --> 01:05:05.709
Her double from another world

1327
01:05:05.710 --> 01:05:08.511
was drawn by Gwenyd's grief.

1328
01:05:08.512 --> 01:05:09.979
For that sorrow was the key

1329
01:05:09.980 --> 01:05:13.349
that could unlock the
door between their worlds.


1330
01:05:13.350 --> 01:05:16.152
She called to Gwenyd,
and she said


1331
01:05:16.153 --> 01:05:18.454
"I'll change places with you."

1332
01:05:18.455 --> 01:05:22.893
Thinking that she would be
reunited with her lover,


1333
01:05:22.894 --> 01:05:24.061
Gwenyd happily agreed.

1334
01:05:25.028 --> 01:05:26.964
She opened that door.

1335
01:05:26.965 --> 01:05:30.266
I mean it's been
six months ago


1336
01:05:30.267 --> 01:05:33.570
when I was drinking for
breakfast.


1337
01:05:33.571 --> 01:05:36.405
Yeah, that's me and I don't
remember it


1338
01:05:36.406 --> 01:05:37.306
but sure that's me.

1339
01:05:37.307 --> 01:05:38.407
But I remember everything now.

1340
01:05:38.408 --> 01:05:40.678
I remember everything now.

1341
01:05:41.980 --> 01:05:44.581
And that I don't remember.

1342
01:05:44.582 --> 01:05:47.985
But once there she
decided it was very evil.


1343
01:05:47.986 --> 01:05:49.452
It wasn't what
she thought at all


1344
01:05:49.453 --> 01:05:51.922
and her twin was truly evil.

1345
01:05:51.923 --> 01:05:54.591
You know, the lighthouse,
I looked at that again


1346
01:05:54.592 --> 01:05:57.895
and maybe that
could be me or not me,


1347
01:05:57.896 --> 01:05:59.462
but I just know I was up here.

1348
01:05:59.463 --> 01:06:01.632
I know I wasn't down there.

1349
01:06:01.633 --> 01:06:04.835
That's not definitive, but
it's me in the side yard.


1350
01:06:04.836 --> 01:06:06.536
That's me in that side yard.

1351
01:06:06.537 --> 01:06:08.504
She wanted to come
back to her own world


1352
01:06:08.505 --> 01:06:09.707
but it was too late.

1353
01:06:11.643 --> 01:06:14.678
You see, Gwenyd's
sorrow was the key


1354
01:06:14.679 --> 01:06:17.882
but only the doppelgĂ¤nger
could control the door.


1355
01:06:19.784 --> 01:06:20.618
I can't.

1356
01:06:21.586 --> 01:06:22.787
I can't explain it.

1357
01:06:24.354 --> 01:06:27.391
The reason I just keep
thinking about Kevin


1358
01:06:28.392 --> 01:06:30.294
being in two places at once.

1359
01:06:31.161 --> 01:06:33.462
You know, like this made me
think of him.


1360
01:06:33.463 --> 01:06:37.834
But I know you can't
be in two places at once.


1361
01:06:37.835 --> 01:06:39.970
It just, that doesn't happen.

1362
01:06:39.971 --> 01:06:42.806
That just doesn't happen.

1363
01:06:44.541 --> 01:06:45.375
Brian's right.

1364
01:06:46.844 --> 01:06:50.246
People can't be in two places at
one time.


1365
01:06:50.247 --> 01:06:51.181
I know that.

1366
01:06:52.917 --> 01:06:55.151
You can't be in two places.

1367
01:06:55.152 --> 01:06:56.153
You can't.

1368
01:06:57.421 --> 01:06:59.856
You physically cannot be in two
places.


1369
01:06:59.857 --> 01:07:00.692
At once.

1370
01:08:27.277 --> 01:08:29.378
Okay.

1371
01:08:29.379 --> 01:08:31.848
So when I got up this morning,

1372
01:08:31.849 --> 01:08:34.216
Kevin sent me two
emails last night


1373
01:08:34.217 --> 01:08:35.384
after three in the morning.

1374
01:08:35.385 --> 01:08:36.453
Here's the first one.

1375
01:08:41.726 --> 01:08:43.527
And it makes no sense.

1376
01:08:45.529 --> 01:08:47.164
Okay.

1377
01:08:47.165 --> 01:08:51.467
And then, right after
he sent that one


1378
01:08:51.468 --> 01:08:52.302
he sent this.

1379
01:09:07.350 --> 01:09:10.287
I don't even know
what to make of this.


1380
01:09:18.863 --> 01:09:20.262
What did you want me to film?

1381
01:09:20.263 --> 01:09:23.900
Okay so I actually want you
to film for the first time.


1382
01:09:23.901 --> 01:09:24.835
Okay.

1383
01:09:24.836 --> 01:09:26.469
So this is gonna be part of
our video


1384
01:09:26.470 --> 01:09:31.142
and it's an introduction
to an amazing weekend.


1385
01:09:32.210 --> 01:09:33.043
What?

1386
01:09:33.044 --> 01:09:34.344
I figured it all out, look.

1387
01:09:35.479 --> 01:09:38.882
I've had a difficult year,
you've had a difficult year,


1388
01:09:38.883 --> 01:09:40.584
we've all had a difficult year.

1389
01:09:40.585 --> 01:09:41.885
- Right.
- And so,


1390
01:09:41.886 --> 01:09:45.021
I finally figured out
a really special thing


1391
01:09:45.022 --> 01:09:46.923
that we can all do together.

1392
01:09:46.924 --> 01:09:48.925
And we're gonna do it this
weekend.


1393
01:09:48.926 --> 01:09:50.392
Both of the kids are gonna be
involved.


1394
01:09:50.393 --> 01:09:51.460
- What?
- Robin's coming.


1395
01:09:51.461 --> 01:09:53.130
Robin's coming from out of town.

1396
01:09:53.131 --> 01:09:54.064
You didn't tell me.

1397
01:09:54.065 --> 01:09:54.798
- How come you didn't
- And Michelle's got


1398
01:09:54.799 --> 01:09:56.298
- tell me?
- the day off.


1399
01:09:56.299 --> 01:09:57.701
Well because I want it to be a
surprise.


1400
01:09:57.702 --> 01:09:59.002
I didn't wanna tell you until I
got it


1401
01:09:59.003 --> 01:09:59.836
all figured out.

1402
01:09:59.837 --> 01:10:01.303
And I've got it all figured out.

1403
01:10:01.304 --> 01:10:02.505
I've got it all arranged.

1404
01:10:02.506 --> 01:10:04.074
Well what is it?

1405
01:10:04.075 --> 01:10:05.374
It's something that's
just gonna bring us


1406
01:10:05.375 --> 01:10:06.475
all together again.

1407
01:10:06.476 --> 01:10:07.711
- What?
- I really think,


1408
01:10:07.712 --> 01:10:10.313
I really think that the
kind of year that we've had,


1409
01:10:11.582 --> 01:10:16.186
specially me, and so I'm trying
to make up for, you know,


1410
01:10:16.187 --> 01:10:18.889
for not always being there for
everybody.


1411
01:10:18.890 --> 01:10:20.724
Just bring the five of us
together


1412
01:10:20.725 --> 01:10:22.826
and have an amazing weekend
together,


1413
01:10:22.827 --> 01:10:24.728
and it's really gonna turn
things around for this family.


1414
01:10:24.729 --> 01:10:26.062
It's gonna be amazing.

1415
01:10:26.063 --> 01:10:27.563
What is it though?

1416
01:10:27.564 --> 01:10:28.866
Honey, it's a surprise.

1417
01:10:29.901 --> 01:10:31.735
I'm telling you that we're
gonna have a surprise


1418
01:10:31.736 --> 01:10:34.838
but it's just gonna be
really, really special.


1419
01:10:34.839 --> 01:10:36.305
Really amazing.

1420
01:10:36.306 --> 01:10:37.340
You're gonna love it.

1421
01:10:40.111 --> 01:10:43.681
It's gonna be incredible.

1422
01:10:55.693 --> 01:10:56.961
Shh.

1423
01:11:06.403 --> 01:11:07.238
Oh shit.

1424
01:11:23.855 --> 01:11:25.255
You reached
Kevin, I'm not available.


1425
01:11:25.256 --> 01:11:27.090
Please leave a message.

1426
01:11:28.893 --> 01:11:29.760
Kevin?

1427
01:11:31.162 --> 01:11:32.295
Where are you?

1428
01:11:32.296 --> 01:11:34.497
You didn't even tell
me you were leaving.


1429
01:11:36.566 --> 01:11:38.702
Kevin, please call me back.

1430
01:11:38.703 --> 01:11:40.737
I really need to talk to you

1431
01:11:40.738 --> 01:11:42.806
about your special weekend.

1432
01:11:42.807 --> 01:11:45.276
I was in your office and I saw,

1433
01:11:46.978 --> 01:11:48.410
where did you go?

1434
01:11:48.411 --> 01:11:50.847
You didn't even tell
me you were leaving.


1435
01:11:50.848 --> 01:11:52.750
I really need to talk to you.

1436
01:11:53.651 --> 01:11:57.087
In fact, what I really want
is I want you to come home


1437
01:11:57.088 --> 01:11:58.554
wherever you are.

1438
01:11:58.555 --> 01:12:01.626
Call me and then I want you to
come home.


1439
01:12:03.160 --> 01:12:05.096
Kevin, please call me.

1440
01:12:09.834 --> 01:12:11.768
Hey mom, how's it going today?

1441
01:12:11.769 --> 01:12:13.402
Hi honey.

1442
01:12:13.403 --> 01:12:15.438
Listen, the reason I called,

1443
01:12:16.974 --> 01:12:18.541
we have to cancel this weekend.

1444
01:12:19.644 --> 01:12:21.543
Really, 'cause I
just talked to Dad


1445
01:12:21.544 --> 01:12:22.812
a couple of hours ago.

1446
01:12:22.813 --> 01:12:23.747
I know.

1447
01:12:23.748 --> 01:12:24.581
Did something come up?

1448
01:12:24.582 --> 01:12:26.482
- Is everything okay?
- Yes.


1449
01:12:26.483 --> 01:12:29.185
Yeah, no everything's fine,
we just,


1450
01:12:29.186 --> 01:12:31.822
just we can't do it this
weekend.


1451
01:12:34.491 --> 01:12:35.393
What's going on?

1452
01:12:37.695 --> 01:12:39.062
You're acting weird.

1453
01:12:39.063 --> 01:12:40.496
No.

1454
01:12:40.497 --> 01:12:42.966
Dad ate something weird,
I don't know,


1455
01:12:42.967 --> 01:12:44.533
he's got a stomach thing.

1456
01:12:44.534 --> 01:12:46.037
So let's reschedule.

1457
01:12:47.171 --> 01:12:48.672
All right.

1458
01:12:48.673 --> 01:12:50.472
And you're all right,
everything's good?


1459
01:12:50.473 --> 01:12:52.541
Is there anything you
need me to do?


1460
01:12:52.542 --> 01:12:54.711
No, no, no, no, no.

1461
01:12:54.712 --> 01:12:55.679
Okay.

1462
01:12:55.680 --> 01:12:58.081
Just stay there, I'll
take care of things.


1463
01:12:58.082 --> 01:13:00.817
Just promise me,
you're not gonna come


1464
01:13:00.818 --> 01:13:02.652
anywhere around
here this weekend.


1465
01:13:02.653 --> 01:13:04.587
Promise me that, okay?

1466
01:13:04.588 --> 01:13:07.257
Are you sure there's
nothing else wrong, mom?


1467
01:13:07.258 --> 01:13:09.558
'Cause I can come
home even if Dad's sick.


1468
01:13:09.559 --> 01:13:11.328
It's not a problem for me.

1469
01:13:11.329 --> 01:13:14.097
No, no, please don't.

1470
01:13:14.098 --> 01:13:15.231
I want you to stay there.

1471
01:13:15.232 --> 01:13:17.233
I'll handle it.

1472
01:13:17.234 --> 01:13:19.136
Mom, you're kind
of freaking me out.


1473
01:13:20.171 --> 01:13:22.706
I don't mean to freak
you out, I'm sorry.


1474
01:13:22.707 --> 01:13:24.841
This is just a terrible time.

1475
01:13:24.842 --> 01:13:27.509
And you know,
we'd love to see you but,


1476
01:13:27.510 --> 01:13:28.378
Yeah I'd love to see you...

1477
01:13:28.379 --> 01:13:30.213
Not this weekend, okay?

1478
01:13:30.214 --> 01:13:32.282
I will call you later.

1479
01:13:32.283 --> 01:13:33.183
I need to get...

1480
01:13:33.184 --> 01:13:34.417
Definitely call me later.

1481
01:13:34.418 --> 01:13:35.418
I will.

1482
01:13:35.419 --> 01:13:38.388
And we'll reschedule
for some other weekend.


1483
01:13:38.389 --> 01:13:40.223
Absolutely.

1484
01:13:40.224 --> 01:13:41.358
I love you.

1485
01:13:41.359 --> 01:13:42.659
Love you too.

1486
01:13:42.660 --> 01:13:44.228
Tell Dad I love him as well.

1487
01:13:45.863 --> 01:13:47.364
I'll do that.

1488
01:13:47.365 --> 01:13:48.366
All right.

1489
01:13:54.271 --> 01:13:55.106
Okay.

1490
01:13:56.340 --> 01:13:58.309
I'm documenting everything now.

1491
01:14:05.416 --> 01:14:08.953
He says the five of us
have to be together.


1492
01:14:10.454 --> 01:14:12.757
It's funny I didn't catch
that the first time.


1493
01:14:14.959 --> 01:14:17.628
But then I saw he
was looking up poison.


1494
01:14:21.432 --> 01:14:22.266
Who does that?

1495
01:14:24.402 --> 01:14:27.003
I mean, we just,

1496
01:14:27.004 --> 01:14:28.439
we lost a kid.

1497
01:14:31.642 --> 01:14:34.378
And now you wanna take away
my remaining kids, are you?


1498
01:14:39.984 --> 01:14:42.987
I obviously can't trust him
anymore.


1499
01:14:45.856 --> 01:14:47.425
At least my kids are safe.

1500
01:14:51.228 --> 01:14:52.463
But I gotta do something.

1501
01:14:53.731 --> 01:14:55.231
Call the police...

1502
01:14:59.036 --> 01:14:59.870
Kevin?

1503
01:15:04.542 --> 01:15:05.709
He's not home.

1504
01:15:08.079 --> 01:15:09.112
Kevin?

1505
01:15:12.783 --> 01:15:14.185
Just what I need.

1506
01:15:21.258 --> 01:15:23.260
I don't know what to do.

1507
01:15:28.632 --> 01:15:30.633
Brian can be here in 20 minutes.

1508
01:15:34.405 --> 01:15:37.474
I just made a mistake,
no big deal.


1509
01:15:37.475 --> 01:15:38.577
See you soon.

1510
01:15:39.543 --> 01:15:40.377
What?!

1511
01:15:42.746 --> 01:15:43.813
Who are you talking to?

1512
01:15:43.814 --> 01:15:45.181
Robin.

1513
01:15:45.182 --> 01:15:46.649
About what?

1514
01:15:46.650 --> 01:15:48.852
About this weekend.

1515
01:15:48.853 --> 01:15:50.320
I canceled this
weekend.


1516
01:15:50.321 --> 01:15:52.689
Well, change of plans.

1517
01:15:52.690 --> 01:15:54.023
After all,

1518
01:15:54.024 --> 01:15:55.593
a mother can be very persuasive

1519
01:15:55.594 --> 01:15:56.960
when she wants to be.

1520
01:15:56.961 --> 01:15:58.329
Oh Jesus.

1521
01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:03.834
Oh god.

1522
01:16:08.973 --> 01:16:09.807
Vickie.

1523
01:16:11.408 --> 01:16:12.910
Oh god.

1524
01:16:15.279 --> 01:16:16.514
Oh god, oh god.

1525
01:16:22.153 --> 01:16:23.087
Oh god, oh.

1526
01:16:40.671 --> 01:16:41.906
Oh god, oh god.

1527
01:17:23.881 --> 01:17:25.181
Oh gosh.

1528
01:17:25.182 --> 01:17:26.016
No, no.

1529
01:17:29.720 --> 01:17:30.521
Oh!

1530
01:17:44.468 --> 01:17:45.869
Mom?

1531
01:17:47.938 --> 01:17:48.771
Help me!

1532
01:17:48.772 --> 01:17:50.441
Michelle?

1533
01:17:52.142 --> 01:17:53.544
- Mom!
- Michelle!


1534
01:17:54.613 --> 01:17:55.779
Mom?

1535
01:18:00.685 --> 01:18:01.751
Don't you love us?

1536
01:18:01.752 --> 01:18:03.153
Robin.

1537
01:18:13.297 --> 01:18:14.131
Oh gosh.

1538
01:18:18.936 --> 01:18:19.769
Mommy!

1539
01:18:30.347 --> 01:18:31.849
No, no.

1540
01:18:35.386 --> 01:18:36.820
Vickie?

1541
01:18:39.123 --> 01:18:40.491
Vickie, are you down there?

1542
01:18:42.426 --> 01:18:43.628
It's not you.

1543
01:18:46.930 --> 01:18:47.766
No, no.

1544
01:18:48.999 --> 01:18:49.833
No, no.

1545
01:18:53.871 --> 01:18:56.640
No!

1546
01:19:00.745 --> 01:19:01.579
Get away!

1547
01:19:03.180 --> 01:19:04.348
What are you?!

1548
01:19:06.016 --> 01:19:06.849
Ouch!

1549
01:19:06.850 --> 01:19:08.586
Stay away!

1550
01:19:12.791 --> 01:19:13.957
Vic?

1551
01:19:20.864 --> 01:19:23.232
Vickie, are you down here?

1552
01:19:23.233 --> 01:19:24.935
The lights aren't working.

1553
01:19:27.572 --> 01:19:29.505
It's not you.

1554
01:19:29.506 --> 01:19:30.608
It's not you.

1555
01:19:32.176 --> 01:19:33.778
- It's not you.
- Vic?


1556
01:19:36.113 --> 01:19:36.946
- Vic?
- Get out, get out!


1557
01:19:36.947 --> 01:19:39.717
Ouch, ouch!

1558
01:19:39.718 --> 01:19:41.250
Vickie, wait!

1559
01:20:05.777 --> 01:20:06.711
The eyes.

1560
01:20:07.645 --> 01:20:08.479
Kevin?

1561
01:20:09.614 --> 01:20:10.480
The eyes!

1562
01:20:10.481 --> 01:20:13.384
Oh my god,
no, no, no, no, no, no!


1563
01:20:15.152 --> 01:20:16.587
Kevin!

1564
01:20:16.588 --> 01:20:18.388
Oh my god, Kevin, Kevin.

1565
01:20:18.389 --> 01:20:19.791
Oh my god, Kevin.

1566
01:20:46.751 --> 01:20:47.685
I killed him.

1567
01:20:53.257 --> 01:20:54.925
I killed my husband.

1568
01:21:01.331 --> 01:21:06.336
But it wasn't him.

1569
01:21:07.404 --> 01:21:08.573
It wasn't him.

1570
01:21:18.549 --> 01:21:19.751
Nobody's gonna believe me.

1571
01:21:23.888 --> 01:21:24.689
Oh god.

1572
01:21:28.125 --> 01:21:30.294
Nobody's gonna believe me.

1573
01:21:33.997 --> 01:21:35.065
Oh god, help.

1574
01:21:42.473 --> 01:21:44.575
Death doesn't
close the door.


1575
01:21:47.246 --> 01:21:52.246
